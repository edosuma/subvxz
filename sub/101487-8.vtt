Hey, everyone. I have some news.

00:55.056 --> 00:59.058
I got a job writing for
Quahog's top website,<i> The Hog.</i>

00:59.226 --> 01:01.510
Starting tomorrow,
I'm an online journalist.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.137
Isn't<i> The Hog</i>
that stupid pop culture site

01:04.231 --> 01:06.065
with those lame quizzes
telling you what character

01:06.216 --> 01:07.715
you are in a show?

01:07.735 --> 01:10.294
Peter's mad 'cause
he always gets Barney Rubble.

01:10.312 --> 01:12.404
If I were mad,
would I laugh like this?

01:12.597 --> 01:13.922
(laughs)

01:13.949 --> 01:15.632
I don't think so.

01:15.692 --> 01:16.909
Congratulations, Brian.

01:17.102 --> 01:18.911
Yeah, we're all very happy
for you.

01:19.104 --> 01:20.470
Thanks. I'm really excited.

01:20.531 --> 01:22.230
And I totally nailed
the interview.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.065
So, Brian,
I got a great recommendation

01:24.085 --> 01:25.584
from your last employer.

01:25.777 --> 01:28.312
Yes, I worked for Mr. Skin
at five dollars a pun.

01:28.372 --> 01:30.422
You know, I came up with
Halle's Berries,

01:30.574 --> 01:32.925
Elle Fanny, Abigail Breastlin.

01:33.118 --> 01:35.410
You're really good
at sexualizing children.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.154
-I-Is that a problem?
-No, no, no.

01:37.256 --> 01:39.323
That's a big part
of online journalism.

01:39.341 --> 01:41.158
Now, let's have a look
at your sample material.

01:41.218 --> 01:43.176
Well, I've got a listicle
of alcohol brands

01:43.329 --> 01:44.752
that are also guys' names.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.755
Whoa! Talk about
bursting out of the gates.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.216
Cardi B tweeted something
and I retweeted it

01:50.319 --> 01:52.427
with "This, this,
this, this, this."

01:52.488 --> 01:55.114
Wow. That is some
top-shelf journalism.

01:55.265 --> 01:56.615
And here's some pictures
of cute animals

01:56.808 --> 01:58.525
that wives can shove
in their husbands' faces

01:58.661 --> 02:00.344
to keep them
from ever going to sleep.

02:00.404 --> 02:03.363
Brian, stop. I can only hire you
so many times.

02:03.515 --> 02:05.182
Welcome to<i> The Hog.</i>

02:05.200 --> 02:08.293
I'll ask my roommate to move
his car so you can pull out.

02:13.417 --> 02:15.359
Cup of joe
and a greasy roll, please.

02:15.419 --> 02:17.619
Okay, whatever this is,
I already hate it.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.046
Sorry, I'm up against
a deadline on a big story.

02:20.199 --> 02:23.717

02:26.480 --> 02:28.705
I, um, I don't...
I-I don't think

02:28.724 --> 02:30.390
this is an article
for human readers.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.967
Now hold on there, Stewie,
just hear the man out.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.394
Thank you, Chris.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.321
I also posted a couple
of articles last night.

Real think pieces.

"Star Wars movies

I haven't seen."

02:42.329 --> 02:44.812
Well, that seems lazy.
And which two didn't you see?

02:44.832 --> 02:47.557
Uh, the original<i> Star Wars</i>
and<i> The Empire Strikes Back.</i>

02:47.659 --> 02:51.152
I'd still rather read that

What?
That's insane.

revered person in Quahog.

(chuckles)
I remember you.

06:22.332 --> 06:23.957
But no, he isn't.
He's a hero.

Not anymore.
He's a racist murderer

(sighs) God, there's a lot
wrong with this,

06:34.228 --> 06:35.301
but you can't tear this down.

06:35.454 --> 06:36.786
Pat's an icon.

That statue belongs
right here in the park,

of Quahog's greatest missionary,

06:41.226 --> 06:42.550
Father Touchboys.

That statue was removed

Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

The town is divided
over whether his statue

07:02.147 --> 07:03.663
should remain in the park.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.758
Even the pigeons who poop on it

Where do you get off?!

07:25.504 --> 07:28.354

Sometimes the bathroom.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.690
Or wherever I see
a lady seal an envelope.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.286
Good, good. I am glad
we can talk frankly about sex.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.362
And Brian,
how dare you try to take down

07:36.457 --> 07:38.290
the statue of Pawtucket Pat?

07:38.441 --> 07:39.365
Oh, my God.
You don't actually support

07:39.518 --> 07:40.850
keeping it there, do you?

07:40.952 --> 07:43.186
Of course I do.
It's been there my whole life.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.538
And I am gonna do whatever
it takes to keep it up.

07:45.691 --> 07:48.374
Finally, Peter cares
about keeping something up.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.711
Lois, will you stifle yourself?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.713

Brian, Pat is a hero.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.980
H-He practically built Quahog.

08:02.131 --> 08:03.389
And his statue
is part of the town.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.317
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

08:05.510 --> 08:08.044
some draft-dodging liberals
tear it down.

08:08.063 --> 08:09.488
-We don't have a draft.
-Well, then,

08:09.681 --> 08:11.715
who shaved my head
and yelled at me for two months?

08:11.775 --> 08:14.475
Peter, we've been over this.
That was the Heaven's Gate cult.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.219
Oh, right, that-that thing
with the shoes.

08:16.279 --> 08:17.979
Yeah, o-once I got the shoes,
I split.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.405
The statue has got to go.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.333
Brian, for years,
it's been a tradition

08:21.526 --> 08:23.668
that every boy,
when he turns 16,

08:23.820 --> 08:27.063
has to kiss the statue's crotch
while his friends take pictures.

08:27.082 --> 08:28.565
That's not a tradition.

08:28.625 --> 08:31.918
Ah, then I think
some fun was had at my expense.

08:32.070 --> 08:34.346
Peter, we can't leave a symbol
like that in the town square.

08:34.497 --> 08:36.256
Pawtucket Pat
was a horrible racist.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.408
Well, so is Tucker Carlson,
but we still say hi to him

08:38.468 --> 08:39.851
at the company picnic.

08:40.003 --> 08:41.745
Brian, if you apply
the values of today

08:41.805 --> 08:44.097
to people who lived
almost 300 year ago,

08:44.249 --> 08:46.024
uh, doesn't that mean we'd have
to take down the statues

08:46.193 --> 08:47.842
of pretty much everyone?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.586
I-I mean,
where do you draw the line?

08:49.646 --> 08:52.088
Wait a minute, y-you don't agree
with Peter, do you?

08:52.148 --> 08:54.257
I don't know.
I-I'm uncomfortable

08:54.359 --> 08:56.684
with a racist statue being smack
in the middle of Quahog,

08:56.745 --> 09:00.780
but as a woman, I need landmarks
to find my way around town.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.434
I mean, without that statue,
I'm completely disoriented.

09:04.452 --> 09:07.546
Okay, if anyone needs me,
I'll be in the kitchen.

09:09.365 --> 09:10.882
Damn it, who moved the lamp?

09:11.075 --> 09:13.610
Well, what does the rest
of the family think? Chris?

09:13.670 --> 09:16.780
-Ha! You got sunflowered.
-What?

09:16.798 --> 09:19.224
When a Gen Z kid

09:19.417 --> 09:21.560
he leaves a large sunflower
in his place.

09:21.753 --> 09:23.061
That's ridiculous.
There is no way

09:23.254 --> 09:24.954
that children
regularly disappear

09:24.973 --> 09:26.956
and then replace themselves
with sunflowers

09:27.017 --> 09:28.474
just to express their boredom.

09:28.627 --> 09:31.236
Ha. You got sunflowered again.

09:31.429 --> 09:32.737
Why are you back?

09:32.889 --> 09:34.647
(scoffs)
We only have one sunflower.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.483
Okay, I-I clearly don't
understand your generation,

09:37.619 --> 09:39.744
but Meg, you're currently
taking world history.

09:39.937 --> 09:41.654
What do you think
should happen to the statue?

09:41.748 --> 09:45.141
I don't care.
I'm an agent of chaos.

09:45.201 --> 09:46.976
Ow! Well, screw you guys.

09:47.037 --> 09:50.589
Pawtucket Pat is a hero.
That statue ain't going nowhere.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.833
It's a part of history.
Just like Catherine the Great.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.668
My great people of Russia.

09:55.762 --> 10:00.323
As your empress, my legacy shall
be expanding Russia's borders,

10:00.383 --> 10:02.583
growing her armies,
building palaces

10:02.644 --> 10:05.252
that will be admired
for centuries...

10:05.272 --> 10:07.755
We heard you had sex
with a horse!

10:07.858 --> 10:12.168
I have created alliances with
the great powers of Europe...

10:12.228 --> 10:14.170
What about the horse sex?

10:14.230 --> 10:16.172
There is no horse sex!

10:16.232 --> 10:17.857
Is this guy
bothering you, Cathy?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.618
I can handle this.

10:22.364 --> 10:25.957
Hey guys, I got you all "Keep
Up the Statue" hats, or "KUTS."

10:26.109 --> 10:29.794
Kuts? Isn't that the lady's
hairdresser down the street?

10:29.946 --> 10:32.047
Why don't you tell me?

10:34.376 --> 10:36.117
Peter, I'm not wearing
a Kuts hat.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.785
Come on, if I refer
three friends,

10:37.804 --> 10:38.987
I get a free blowout.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.546
Tell them
Mary Sparkles sent you.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.016
But never call me that
in front of my family.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.478
Where was this place, again?

10:46.629 --> 10:49.296
Peter, anybody who supports
that statue is a racist.

10:49.358 --> 10:52.133
Racist? How can
a 300-pound white guy

10:52.194 --> 10:54.711
who looks at black porn
be racist?

10:54.729 --> 10:56.321
Here, Peter.
You were sent a beer

10:56.490 --> 10:58.156
by that table of businessmen.

10:58.307 --> 11:00.049
-Which table?
-No, no. No, no. Don't look.

11:00.151 --> 11:02.385
Make them come to you.

11:02.404 --> 11:04.704
You guys haven't read
my book, have you?

11:09.119 --> 11:11.244
-Peter, they're leaving.
-They'll come.

11:11.396 --> 11:13.413
They're getting in
their vehicle.

11:13.565 --> 11:15.322
-They're pulling into the street
without looking.
-(tires screech, loud crash)

11:15.342 --> 11:17.083
Oh, no, they've been hit
by a bus!

11:17.219 --> 11:19.252
They'll come.
I followed the rules.

11:19.404 --> 11:21.346
Peter, they can't come.
They're dead.

11:21.539 --> 11:24.165
That was the day
I lost my sparkle.

11:24.226 --> 11:27.018
I was just Mary after that.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.506
Excuse me, would you sign
this petition demanding

11:32.567 --> 11:34.008
that the city take down the...

11:34.069 --> 11:35.509
Take down the what?

11:35.529 --> 11:37.511
-Uh, nothing.
-Good.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.089
Hey, could you do me a favor
and elbow-wipe

11:40.108 --> 11:42.850
74 years of pigeon (bleep)
off my shoulders?

11:42.953 --> 11:44.703
Uh, okay.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.280
Who are you, anyway?

11:47.432 --> 11:49.523
I'm Rhode Island founder
Roger Williams,

11:49.626 --> 11:52.359
otherwise known as the end
of the worst field trip

11:52.421 --> 11:54.437
in elementary school history.

11:54.497 --> 11:57.440
It's true.
The kids are very disappointed.

11:57.500 --> 12:02.053
Oh, yeah, "And Wife" is totally
getting' them jazzed.

12:02.246 --> 12:06.182
-(horn honks)
-Move, Brian, you're in my spot.

12:08.044 --> 12:09.619
You're Mrs. Groceries?

12:09.679 --> 12:11.545
She touched the manager
over the pants.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.123
Love her or hate her,
she plays to win.

12:14.142 --> 12:15.567
-Anyway, how's it going?
-Not good.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.569
I'm not getting any signatures
on this petition.

12:17.762 --> 12:19.553
Really? It looks like
you've got quite a few.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.148
Oh, mostly they just say,
"Brian is gay."

12:22.242 --> 12:24.576
Yeah, I have to be careful.
If 200 people write it,

12:24.727 --> 12:26.894
-it goes on the ballot.
-Well, at least you're trying.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.154
I mean, what is Peter doing

12:28.306 --> 12:29.581
to drum up support
for his side?

12:29.732 --> 12:31.324
PETER (on bullhorn):
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:31.460 --> 12:34.544
to support Pawtucket Pat,
please welcome Kid Rock.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.572
Hello, Quahog.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.501
Whenever there's a town debate
with racial overtones,

12:41.653 --> 12:44.453
-I'm there on the wrong side.
-(all cheering)

12:44.473 --> 12:46.598
Aw, crap, everybody run.
It's Adult Rock.

12:46.791 --> 12:49.008
Kid, you want to tell me why
I found your mother's

12:49.160 --> 12:51.919
best T-shirt-cutting scissors
outside in the rain?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.846
-(scoffs) I don't know.
-(sighs)

12:53.999 --> 12:57.233
Why can't you be more
like your brother, The?

13:00.930 --> 13:03.356
Rupert, I was going over
our credit card statement.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.526
There's a charge for two tickets
to<i> Tootsie</i> the musical,

13:06.620 --> 13:10.604
yet I don't remember going
to see<i> Tootsie</i> the musical.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.441
Now, I'm hoping the good news
is I'm ruining the surprise.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.369
God, I can't believe
Peter is actually winning

13:16.463 --> 13:18.371
public support
for that damn statue.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.189
And he's throwing rocks
through my window,

13:20.250 --> 13:21.448
and it's his house.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.784
-(Peter grunting)
-(heavy thud)

13:23.845 --> 13:25.286
Ugh, that rock was too heavy.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.122
Got to find something lighter.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.216
Okay, so something in between.

13:30.368 --> 13:31.792
That statue is such a disgrace.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.536
I'll tell you,
part of me wants to march down

13:33.638 --> 13:35.388
to that park
and remove it myself.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.682
Well, why don't you?
It'd be a noble act.

13:37.876 --> 13:39.484
Think of it
as civil disobedience.

13:39.677 --> 13:41.635
Disobedience?
But I'm a good boy.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.322
I obey. I always obey.
I'm a good boy who obeys.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.215
Okay, d-don't think
of it as disobedience,

13:46.234 --> 13:47.884
Forget I used that word.

13:47.986 --> 13:49.494
You're a weird guy, Bri.

13:49.687 --> 13:51.645
A weird doggy guy.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.256
PETER:
Ha! Found some medium rocks.

13:54.258 --> 13:56.059
You know what?
That's a great idea.

13:56.077 --> 13:59.153
Like not separating immigrant
children from their families.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.422
<i> (applause)</i>

14:03.418 --> 14:05.251
If you're the first one
to stop applauding,

14:05.387 --> 14:07.070
that means you're racist.

14:07.088 --> 14:09.180
<i> (applause intensifies)</i>

14:10.225 --> 14:12.433
<i> (applause continues)</i>

14:14.879 --> 14:15.928
<i> (applause stops)</i>

14:16.081 --> 14:17.580
Thanks for helping me, Stewie.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.931
All right, let's tie the rope
around the statue

14:19.084 --> 14:20.341
and tow it out of here.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.767
All right, great.
But before we begin,

14:21.862 --> 14:23.753
I'm just going to use
the park bathroom

14:23.855 --> 14:25.446
-at night.
-Stewie, no.

14:28.726 --> 14:30.118
I got a lollipop!

14:33.707 --> 14:35.039
That's great, bud.

14:42.073 --> 14:44.716
Now let's stop talking about
that lollipop and get to work.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.797
Okay, we're almost
ready to do this.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.116
Did you bring the masks?

14:53.134 --> 14:54.800
-Right here.
-What the hell is this?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.636
You said to bring masks.

14:56.788 --> 14:58.730
These are from last year's
charity ball at the Guggenheim.

14:58.923 --> 15:01.140
Whatever. Just help me
tie this rope to the car.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.384
Sorry, I need a free hand
to hold up my mask.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.528
Enough with the damn masks!

15:12.395 --> 15:14.537
All right, let's get this statue
out of here.

15:28.285 --> 15:31.578
I guess you only paid
for driver's side airbags.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.016
Yeah. When I bought this, I was
dating a girl I didn't like.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.666
Wow, look at this.

15:43.726 --> 15:45.944
The statue's disappearance
is being covered everywhere.

15:46.095 --> 15:47.670
I can't believe
we really did it.

15:47.689 --> 15:49.522
-I just hope
we don't get caught.
-So what?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.008
Mom would just ground us
and take away screen time,

15:52.068 --> 15:54.786
and then realize that without
screens, she has to entertain us

15:54.937 --> 15:56.270
and immediately give it back.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.698
Stewie, destroying
a statue is a felony.

15:58.808 --> 16:00.199
If we're caught,
we'll go to prison.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.201
Prison?!
I can't go to prison.

16:02.353 --> 16:04.704
Peter watched
all six seasons of<i> Oz</i>

16:04.798 --> 16:06.372
with me in a Babybjörn.

16:06.524 --> 16:09.283
I'm too young to have
someone go poo on my face.

16:09.386 --> 16:13.179
Well, there's really
no good age for it to happen.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.810
All right, Stewie, just relax.

16:18.961 --> 16:21.037
And don't do that weird,
nervous laugh you do

16:21.097 --> 16:22.872
-when you're hiding something.
-Got it.

16:22.890 --> 16:26.058
-Morning, everybody.
-Where have you guys been?

16:26.194 --> 16:27.819
(cackles)

16:28.012 --> 16:29.136
No-Nowhere, of course!

16:29.197 --> 16:30.713
(quietly):
Will you calm down?

16:30.732 --> 16:32.381
So, uh, where's Peter?

16:32.400 --> 16:34.900
Uh, he went to some rally
'cause the statue's gone.

16:35.053 --> 16:39.146
He's angrier than Al Pacino's
forehead liver spots.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.240
Comb your hair down
instead of up.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.501
Give us some shade.
We're dying up here.

16:43.652 --> 16:45.152
Yeah, what do you call
that haircut?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.653
You're nearly 80 years old.

16:46.789 --> 16:48.506
You look like the kid
from<i> Jerry Maguire.</i>

16:48.699 --> 16:51.342
What are you going for
with all of these spots?

16:51.494 --> 16:53.919
I want to look like
mashed potatoes,

16:54.055 --> 16:56.088
with the skins on.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.391
(indistinct chatter)

17:10.387 --> 17:12.104
This is awesome.
What a turnout.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.014
And look, here comes Fox News.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.850
(horn playing "Dixie")

17:16.911 --> 17:19.370
It's amazing how recently
that show aired.

17:19.563 --> 17:22.523
That statue was a travesty
and so is the brewery.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.858
They should close it
and make juice instead.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.269
What?
How dare you?

17:26.329 --> 17:28.046
Juice will not replace us.

17:28.197 --> 17:29.955
(chanting):
Juice will not replace us!

17:30.091 --> 17:32.108
Juice will not replace us!

17:32.126 --> 17:33.551
My God, Peter,
what are you doing?

17:33.702 --> 17:36.554
Taking up politics
to avoid intimacy with my wife.

17:36.747 --> 17:38.222
Peter, is that you?

17:38.415 --> 17:40.707
(gasps) I thought
we could protest together.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.619
All right, no more politics.
Time for trains in the basement.

17:43.679 --> 17:46.289
-MAN: Stop!
-Collaborate and listen.

17:46.349 --> 17:48.232
We are from
the Narragansett tribe,

17:48.425 --> 17:51.385
from whom Pawtucket Pat
stole his recipe.

17:51.488 --> 17:55.556
And we are annoyed that no one
has asked us what we think.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.484
You guys kind of dress
like weekend Jay Leno.

17:58.620 --> 18:02.655
Thank you. We've just come
from the Wang-Holder wedding.

18:02.791 --> 18:03.989
(laughs)
See?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.808
Little more of that,
John Oliver,

18:05.827 --> 18:07.919
and maybe you'll finally
get that 14th Emmy.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.736
Well, what do you guys think?

18:09.756 --> 18:12.239
This statue is only the tip
of the iceberg.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.151
The pressing issue isn't
what someone did 300 years ago,

18:15.253 --> 18:17.578
it's how do we help
Native Americans today

18:17.597 --> 18:21.248
and end the institutional racism
that still plagues society?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.059
The poverty rate
on reservations...

18:24.128 --> 18:26.771
Oh, damn, you got sunflowered.

18:26.922 --> 18:28.106
Everyone, come back.

18:28.299 --> 18:30.333
Uh, come back.
he makes a good point.

18:30.351 --> 18:33.594
We've all been so focused
on what the statue means to us

18:33.613 --> 18:35.020
we didn't even stop to consider

18:35.115 --> 18:37.264
how Pawtucket Pat
affected others.

18:37.358 --> 18:39.008
But Pat's the town hero.

18:39.068 --> 18:41.694
If he's nothing,
then so is Quahog.

18:41.846 --> 18:44.196
-(indistinct chatter)
-No, it's not.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.125
Quahog is still
a wonderful town.

18:47.318 --> 18:49.627
I-I mean, we still got
one of those Arby's signs.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.463
You know? T-The old ones,
you know, with the big old hat?

18:52.656 --> 18:54.632
That's been gone for ten years.

18:54.825 --> 18:56.968
Oh, (bleep) this place.

18:57.161 --> 18:58.785
No, no, you know what?
No.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.546
Quahog is a wonderful town,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.866
because of who we are
and what we do,

19:03.926 --> 19:07.961
not because of some guy
who stole beer 300 years ago.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.130
Especially when
he did horrible things

19:10.191 --> 19:12.132
to some of our fellow citizens.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.727
Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.045
Thank you, Peter.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.804
Now, crowd of angry whites,

19:17.866 --> 19:21.492
I think we all owe our Native
American friends an apology.

19:21.685 --> 19:23.052
ALL:
Sorry.

19:23.154 --> 19:24.887
Angry whites.

19:24.947 --> 19:27.314
-ALL: Sorry!
-That's better.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.150
Well, Brian, I guess
I owe you an apology, too.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.836
You were right from the start.

19:32.029 --> 19:33.654
Sorry things got
so heated between us

19:33.756 --> 19:35.731
and that I took a dump
in your dog food.

19:35.791 --> 19:38.342
-Wait, what?
-I know. Politics, huh?

19:38.535 --> 19:42.180
-Come on everybody,
let's go home.
-I'll drive.

19:44.875 --> 19:47.018
Where the hell are we?

19:54.585 --> 19:56.009
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.437
Our top story:
the statue of Pawtucket Pat

19:58.589 --> 20:00.773
was found earlier today
in the Quahog River.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.517
In the spirit of compromise,
the town has decided

20:03.536 --> 20:05.852
that it will be
relocated to the Quahog Museum,

20:05.955 --> 20:07.521
where it will be both remembered

20:07.540 --> 20:09.523
and never seen
by anyone ever again.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.451
Well, thank God this whole
controversy is behind us.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.046
Yeah. And Peter, I'm glad
you came to your senses.

20:15.197 --> 20:18.123
Me, too. You know, we might
even win an award for this.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.218
-Really?
-Yeah, award voters love it

20:20.386 --> 20:21.886
when someone
with a right-leaning viewpoint

20:22.055 --> 20:23.537
admits they're wrong.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.947
They declare
it's good storytelling

20:25.007 --> 20:26.224
and character development.

20:26.417 --> 20:28.226
Ooh, like<i> Three Billboards.</i>

20:28.419 --> 20:30.453
-And<i> Green Book.</i>
<i> -Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

20:30.513 --> 20:32.063
<i> American History X.</i>

20:32.256 --> 20:33.898
Yeah, all those.
And many more.

20:34.091 --> 20:37.050
But can anyone name a single
movie where someone on the left

20:37.111 --> 20:40.796
took on a more
Republican-leaning viewpoint?

20:40.856 --> 20:42.815
Doesn't even have
to have won an award.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.951
Just has to exist.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.487
Anyone?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.656
Anything?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.918
What about Fritz Lang's
<i> Metropolis?</i>

20:54.111 --> 20:55.311
How'd you get here?

20:55.371 --> 20:58.572
Mm, in my Hyundai Sonata.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.299
(shudders)

21:32.166 --> 21:34.292
