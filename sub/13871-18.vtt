00:59.689 --> 01:02.123
<i>Fat man, arise.</i>

01:02.191 --> 01:03.317
Oh god.

01:03.393 --> 01:05.691
<i>Now you listen directly to me.</i>

01:05.762 --> 01:08.287
<i>For I am the ghost of Christmas Past...</i>

01:08.364 --> 01:12.357
<i>...and I have come to show you
what Christmas was like.</i>

01:14.170 --> 01:15.220
Alright.

01:15.228 --> 01:19.005
<i>This was Christmas for little Carl in 1968.</i>

01:19.742 --> 01:22.506
Oh boy. Oh boy. I hope
this is a new mommy.

01:22.578 --> 01:26.776
Yeah, it's not. Unwrap, you little creep.
We gotta be in work in an hour.

01:26.849 --> 01:29.477
What's this there? Is this
carpet, daddy?

01:29.552 --> 01:32.919
Carpet? No no. It's Berber.
That's an industry term.

01:32.989 --> 01:35.321
Hey, it's like a flying magic carpet here.

01:35.391 --> 01:37.621
Look at this. I am flying
around in Egyptland.

01:37.694 --> 01:40.128
That's cute. Don't get
too attached to it, lad.

01:40.196 --> 01:42.528
...'cause it's about to be
a magic flying dinner.

01:42.598 --> 01:45.499
You can't eat carpet. Silly daddy.

01:45.568 --> 01:48.332
Of course you can't like that.
You gotta boil it.

01:48.404 --> 01:52.773
...till the glue gets soft, you know.
Oh Geez! look at the time.

01:52.842 --> 01:55.276
- But it's Christmas, daddy.
- you are not getting out of this.

01:55.345 --> 01:57.540
Put on your work boots
and your respirators.

01:57.613 --> 02:00.741
I had to pull a lot of strings to
get him to hire an eight year old.

02:00.817 --> 02:02.944
Don't make me go. I
don't want to make...

02:03.019 --> 02:05.317
- Come on, you are late!
- Oh god!

02:05.988 --> 02:08.320
<i>You remember that Christmas, don't you??</i>

02:08.390 --> 02:10.757
No. I you know, I
remember eating carpet.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.952
Not so much the lasers
and the robots though.

02:14.030 --> 02:18.558
<i>The war of man against machines
raged on through the early 70s.</i>

02:18.735 --> 02:23.104
<i>You don't rememebr because back
then, it was only a prophecy...</i>

02:23.172 --> 02:26.539
<i>...Yet  but now in the future,
the past has oocured..</i>

02:26.609 --> 02:29.806
<i>- Just hang on a second, OK.
- Sure.</i>

02:30.179 --> 02:32.807
You are the ghost of
Christmas Past, right?

02:32.882 --> 02:34.372
<i>That is correct.</i>

02:34.450 --> 02:39.046
Ok well, I mean you know
that it is February, right?

02:40.857 --> 02:44.315
<i>- I am a robot
- Well yes, obviously.</i>

02:44.827 --> 02:46.351
Are you stupid?

02:47.196 --> 02:51.599
No I'm...I will see you in December.
Tomorrow.

02:51.667 --> 02:55.125
Ok whatever there,
just lock your door on the way...

02:55.972 --> 02:58.202
<i>- Do what?
- Never mind. Just leave!</i>

02:58.408 --> 03:00.069
- Oh great.
- Hey, Carl.

03:00.143 --> 03:01.940
What are you here? What else happened?

03:02.011 --> 03:04.479
- My car messed up?
- Sorry listen. I wouldn't bother you...

03:04.547 --> 03:07.107
It's all on my roof, isn't it?
What? The robot is on my roof, right?

03:07.183 --> 03:09.651
- He is ripping up my shingles.
- Carl, just relax.

03:09.719 --> 03:13.587
Listen. This is totally
not a big deal.

03:13.790 --> 03:17.419
This is a big deal! It's a very big deal!
What is this?!

03:17.493 --> 03:21.190
Look at first I thought this was that
stuff that turns red when you pee in it...

03:21.264 --> 03:24.927
...'cause I had to pee here a number
of times. But look at it, Carl.

03:25.001 --> 03:26.434
That's blood, my friend.

03:26.502 --> 03:30.939
Damn, it's like somone wrung out a
herd of cows to a juicer or something.

03:31.007 --> 03:33.134
This is not cow blood, Carl.

03:33.209 --> 03:36.178
This is Elfen blood!

03:36.746 --> 03:41.479
<i>- Who would do something like this to me?
- well, I don't know. Maybe...</i>

03:41.684 --> 03:43.899
<i>Oh wait. I did it.</i>

03:43.934 --> 03:45.916
So, why did you fill
Carl's pool with blood?

03:45.988 --> 03:50.687
<i>Well, this is going to take a long
time.So, you may want to get some snacks.</i>

03:50.760 --> 03:53.285
No no, that;s alright. I
think I can wait for it.

03:53.362 --> 03:55.023
Well, I am going to get food.

03:55.097 --> 03:57.497
<i>Thousands of years ago...</i>

03:57.498 --> 03:59.898
<i>...Before the dawn of
man as we knew him...</i>

03:59.969 --> 04:02.938
<i>...There was Sir Santa of Claus...</i>

04:03.005 --> 04:04.984
<i>..an ape like creature making...</i>

04:04.985 --> 04:06.964
<i>...crude and pointless toys...</i>

04:07.043 --> 04:09.807
<i>...out of dino bones and his own waste...</i>

04:09.879 --> 04:13.906
<i>...hurling them at chimp like
creatures with crinkled hands...</i>

04:13.983 --> 04:17.475
<i>...regardless of how they
behaved the previous year.</i>

04:17.553 --> 04:21.956
<i>These so called toys
were buried as witches...</i>

04:22.024 --> 04:25.687
<i>...and defecated upon and
hurled at predators...</i>

04:25.761 --> 04:29.822
<i>..who were woken by the searing
grunts of the children.</i>

04:29.899 --> 04:33.096
<i>It wasn't a holly jolly
Chirstmas that year...</i>

04:33.169 --> 04:36.070
<i>...For many were killed.</i>

04:37.139 --> 04:39.164
But that still doesn't tell me why...

04:39.242 --> 04:42.769
<i>I have not finished. You
should have gotten a snack.</i>

04:42.879 --> 04:45.143
<i>A war like race of elfs...</i>

04:45.214 --> 04:48.377
<i>..from the red planet landed
on the ice encased Earth...</i>

04:48.451 --> 04:50.464
<i>...and they were immediately enslaveds...</i>

04:50.465 --> 04:52.478
<i>...by the unevolved Santa ape...</i>

04:52.555 --> 04:54.682
<i>..to make his confused toys...</i>

04:54.757 --> 04:57.419
<i>...using galactic Elfen technology...</i>

04:57.593 --> 05:00.084
<i>...for ever more Santionatos.</i>

05:00.296 --> 05:04.756
<i>Toys were made into recocnizable
shapes and given names...</i>

05:05.134 --> 05:06.260
<i>...like 'train '.</i>

05:06.335 --> 05:10.101
<i>But these toys were also thrown
at predators and defacated upon...</i>

05:10.473 --> 05:12.873
<i>...because they were so stupid.</i>

05:12.942 --> 05:14.739
<i>Christmas still sucked...</i>

05:14.877 --> 05:16.469
<i>..in a big way.</i>

05:16.546 --> 05:21.040
Well, this is a long story, Maybe
I will get something to eat.

05:21.117 --> 05:24.052
Yeah, maybe I am gonna get
drunk while listening to this.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.988
<i>-So, about this blood.
- Let's just wait for them.</i>

05:34.664 --> 05:36.757
<i>So, you been in the neighbourhood long or?</i>

05:36.832 --> 05:40.666
- Well, I mean we moved here next to Carl...
- Alright, we are back.

05:40.736 --> 05:43.204
<i>Thousands of years ago...</i>

05:43.272 --> 05:46.139
<i>...ice had made the globe innvigable...</i>

05:46.208 --> 05:49.939
<i>...Santa ape did not know
what a North Pole was.</i>

05:50.046 --> 05:53.743
<i>How could he? He was born
before science existed.</i>

05:53.816 --> 05:56.808
<i>So, he arbitralily placed his workshop...</i>

05:56.886 --> 06:00.378
<i>...right here, long before they unionized
...</i>

06:00.456 --> 06:04.153
<i>...And Christmas was celebrated at each full moon...</i>

06:04.226 --> 06:06.558
<i>...in front of the great red ape...</i>

06:06.629 --> 06:09.154
Wait wait wait. Who unionized?

06:09.231 --> 06:12.098
<i>Wouldn't you like to know?
Probably your mama.</i>

06:12.168 --> 06:14.762
Dang. He made me sad. Today,
I had to open a door...

06:14.837 --> 06:18.102
... in front of an ape and they
were all made out of doo doo.

06:18.174 --> 06:19.664
What kind of Christmas is that?

06:19.742 --> 06:22.370
It's Ok, Meatwad. This
is all a bunch of bull.

06:22.445 --> 06:23.673
<i>You don't believe?</i>

06:23.746 --> 06:26.613
Believe what? That you are a
ghost and Santa Claus is an ape?

06:26.682 --> 06:30.083
<i>- That's ridiculous...
- Was an ape. Now, he is a machine.</i>

06:30.152 --> 06:34.350
I left cookie and glass
of milk for a machine?

06:34.423 --> 06:36.254
<i>No man, he is an ape.</i>

06:36.692 --> 06:40.355
<i>Wait, he is a machine. You were
trying to mess me up on purpose.</i>

06:40.429 --> 06:42.260
But I thought everyone
back then was undeveloped.

06:42.331 --> 06:44.492
Couldn't make machines with
their crinckled hands.

06:44.567 --> 06:48.697
<i>The elfs came from the red planet
and there was much defacation.</i>

06:48.771 --> 06:50.966
Yeah yeah, you mentioned that.
How long ago did you say this was?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.905
<i>-Thousands of years ago...
- No, Shut up!</i>

06:52.975 --> 06:56.103
You still haven't explained why the
pool is filled with elf blood.

06:56.178 --> 06:59.773
<i>I told you earlier. It
was the Great Circuiting</i>

06:59.849 --> 07:02.977
<i>- You didn't mention no Great Circuiting
-  Oh, I didn't?</i>

07:03.953 --> 07:06.080
<i>Thousands of years ago...</i>

07:06.155 --> 07:08.919
<i>..Before the dawn of
man as we knew him...</i>

07:08.991 --> 07:10.686
<i>...there was a creature...</i>

07:10.760 --> 07:12.352
<i>...named ape mother.</i>

07:12.428 --> 07:15.886
<i>And that is where babies come from...</i>

07:16.198 --> 07:17.825
<i>...for machines.</i>

07:17.900 --> 07:22.462
Boy, that's some story. It kinda
is different from what I remember

07:22.538 --> 07:25.507
...being told about people
loving each other and...

07:25.574 --> 07:27.292
...you know, feces...

07:27.392 --> 07:29.635
<i>No, that is very wrong.</i>

07:29.712 --> 07:33.580
<i>You cling to your pathethic
fable of fluid exchange.</i>

07:34.750 --> 07:37.844
<i>- I am talking.
- I am sorry.</i>

07:37.953 --> 07:40.114
I nodded off. What did I miss?

07:40.189 --> 07:43.158
Well, you should have been listening
'cause he said that the elfs...

07:43.225 --> 07:46.422
..tried to unionize 'cause Santa
ape was using their machines ...

07:46.495 --> 07:48.793
...and turned into a war between...

07:48.864 --> 07:51.355
...the elfs and machines
and the machines won.

07:51.434 --> 07:54.267
And then this here, this
hill we are standing on...

07:54.336 --> 07:55.536
...is an Elfen playground.

07:55.537 --> 07:56.736
<i>It is a graveyard!</i>

07:56.806 --> 07:58.330
Playground.

07:58.407 --> 08:00.773
And that's why pool is
filled with blood ...

08:00.843 --> 08:03.835
...'cause he over there, that
ghost, he is haunting it...

08:03.913 --> 08:06.814
...'cause Carl desacrated
it "cause he lives here.

08:06.882 --> 08:09.783
Something too about babies.
Babies get made that way.

08:09.852 --> 08:12.980
- Hey Carl, did you get all that?
- Hey Carl, wake up. You're wasted.

08:13.055 --> 08:14.989
- What?
- You didn't hear a word he said, did you?

08:15.057 --> 08:18.185
- I guess not. What he said?
- I hate to be a buzzkill...

08:18.260 --> 08:21.229
...but he said that your house in on
elf graves and they are pissed off.

08:21.297 --> 08:23.128
Alright fine. We will do that.

08:23.199 --> 08:25.963
And the bllod is gonna
keep flowing unless...

08:26.035 --> 08:30.563
<i>Unless Carl pays tribute
to the Elfen elders in space.</i>

08:30.639 --> 08:32.368
I will do it. What do I do?

08:32.441 --> 08:35.706
<i>You must give up yourself
to the great red ape.</i>

08:35.778 --> 08:38.905
<i>- OK. How much?
- Sexually.</i>

08:39.715 --> 08:40.807
Wonderful.

08:40.883 --> 08:43.510
Hey man. You know, you
don't have to move.

08:43.586 --> 08:46.282
You could do that other thing
that the robot talked about.

08:46.355 --> 08:49.916
I know it's been a wild ride but
I am not gonna get humped...

08:49.992 --> 08:52.859
...by a giant red gorrila in space, OK?

08:52.928 --> 08:56.557
No thank you.No get lost. I got
a guy coming over here to...

08:56.632 --> 08:58.998
...hopefully put it off
on my bloody house.

08:59.068 --> 09:02.060
I don't need you here
freaking him out. Oh god!

09:03.539 --> 09:06.167
Whoa. I will tell you what. Why don't
you go next door and use our bathroom?

09:06.242 --> 09:09.609
That's just what I want to do is you
know, get nude in your house.

09:10.327 --> 09:15.213
<i>Oh Carl, how you gonna sell
this house full of blood, G?</i>

09:15.284 --> 09:19.220
Yes, so, it's a full, you know, a
full 3-2. You got good schools here.

09:19.288 --> 09:21.688
You got the bonus rooms here with the...

09:21.757 --> 09:24.055
<i>We shall go to Mexico tomorrow.</i>

09:24.126 --> 09:28.790
...and this freaking robot, there he is.
And in the summertime, you got this.

09:28.864 --> 09:31.560
I got a question. How
long do this blood last?

09:31.634 --> 09:34.694
I don't know, you know. Let me talk
to my blood guy here.

09:34.770 --> 09:39.434
<i>The Elfen blood will flow forever
for eternity from the elfen graves.</i>

09:39.508 --> 09:40.508
<i>Forever.</i>

09:40.576 --> 09:45.479
This is fu***ing great. I am gonna line this
thing with gargoyles for the sacrifices.

09:45.548 --> 09:48.642
- What's your name again?
- Danzig you motherfu***ker...

09:50.085 --> 09:54.021
Now, is there a way to get the
blood to flow up the walls?

09:54.089 --> 09:55.522
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

09:55.591 --> 09:58.992
That's good, right? Going up a
wall, That's elf blood too.

09:59.061 --> 10:00.926
- That's not cheap.
- So, what do you want?

10:00.996 --> 10:03.430
I don't know, You know, maybe...

10:03.732 --> 10:07.327
- A million?
- Kill it. Draft a check tomorrow.

10:07.403 --> 10:09.394
You serious? Thank you, god.

10:10.539 --> 10:12.803
Does he have to run those
damn sprinklers all the time?

10:12.875 --> 10:15.343
This sure makes out house look a hell
of a lot better, don't you think?

10:15.411 --> 10:17.208
- I am gonna go talk to him.
- He is coming over here.

10:17.279 --> 10:19.907
OK. Get out of here. I will
handle it.Don't. Just go away.

10:19.982 --> 10:22.576
- Meatwad, come out. Hurry!
- Hey, Butt wipe, open up.

10:22.651 --> 10:26.280
-  Hey Danzig, how's it going, buddy?
- Yeah yeah. You guys seen my robot?

10:26.355 --> 10:29.017
- Yeah, he is  right over there.
- Shut up! Yeah, we haven't seen him.

10:29.091 --> 10:31.218
'Cause I am real low on the blood front right now...

10:31.293 --> 10:33.090
..and he is supposed to be
hooking me up with that.

10:33.162 --> 10:36.256
I don't know what to tell you. I mean,
I'll let you know if we see him.

10:36.332 --> 10:40.632
Hey, you want something to eat? I can go
make you something...

10:40.703 --> 10:43.035
...in our haunted kitchen.

10:43.239 --> 10:47.972
Danzig, want something to eat?

10:48.210 --> 10:51.668
I don't like to change the subject
but, but have you seen how low...

10:51.747 --> 10:53.908
..low the interest rates
on mortgages right now?

10:53.983 --> 10:55.382
It's a buyer's market.

10:55.451 --> 10:59.114
Now look. Listen to me as
hard as you fu***ing can.

10:59.188 --> 11:03.852
That fu***ing robot came with the fu***ing
house and now he is fu***ing gone.

11:03.926 --> 11:05.917
If you see that mother...

11:05.995 --> 11:07.826
- Yeah, we will tell him.
- You fu***ing better.

11:07.897 --> 11:10.798
If I find out he is over here,
I am gonna be eating cereal...

11:10.866 --> 11:13.960
<i>...out of the bottom of your
fu***ing skull..Verständlich?</i>

11:14.036 --> 11:15.970
OK, so...

11:16.939 --> 11:18.031
Thank you.

11:18.107 --> 11:20.405
Alright man, you can come
