10:09.773 --> 10:11.974
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>where this goes.</i>

10:18.180 --> 10:18.980
That should take care of it.

10:18.990 --> 10:20.715
I mean seriously, we gotta
lift from the knees when

10:20.783 --> 10:22.283
you're doing that.

10:22.350 --> 10:23.484
Thanks for the [inaudible], take care.

10:30.959 --> 10:33.160

10:39.934 --> 10:42.502
You getting anything?

10:42.570 --> 10:44.171
Random stuff.

10:44.238 --> 10:48.474
Never ceases to amaze me;
you're like a telepathic radar.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.475
Early warning
detection system.

10:50.543 --> 10:52.745
The last line of defense against
all foreign and domestic...

10:52.813 --> 10:56.381
<i>[hearing spell] This is</i>

11:04.157 --> 11:06.791
Do you see
somebody up there?

11:06.859 --> 11:10.494
Yeah, 2 o'clock, he's fixing
the lights or something.

11:10.562 --> 11:12.197

11:12.264 --> 11:13.832

[♪]

11:18.670 --> 11:20.971
Oh hey Toby, talk to me.

11:21.039 --> 11:23.373
He wasn't fixing
the lights.

11:23.441 --> 11:25.209
What did you read?

11:25.276 --> 11:26.576
Where'd he go?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.545
Where'd who go;
who is this guy?

11:28.613 --> 11:29.913
I got to find Michelle.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.315
Are you sure this wasn't
another pink balloon.

11:32.383 --> 11:33.917
He's got a rifle,
he's going to use it.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.519
Okay I'm coming with you;
I just got to pack the rig up.

11:36.587 --> 11:38.821
We've searched the catwalks,
there's no one there.

11:38.889 --> 11:40.256
I know what I saw.

11:40.323 --> 11:41.624
So you read a guy thinking
about a gun,

11:41.691 --> 11:43.692
does that mean there is a gun?

11:43.761 --> 11:45.694
I still don't know how
this thing of yours works.

11:45.763 --> 11:47.196
You have to search
everybody; you have to

11:47.264 --> 11:48.497
check every room.

11:48.565 --> 11:50.733
We do that and the
convention is over.

11:50.801 --> 11:52.135
That's not my call.

11:52.202 --> 11:53.402
You're the witness, you
saw the gun, you have to

11:53.470 --> 11:56.204
convince my boss and you
have to back him up.

11:56.273 --> 11:57.339
Understood?

11:57.407 --> 11:59.841
Totes... yes.

12:01.645 --> 12:03.078
Totes is like yes.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.049
Mr. Bay?

12:08.117 --> 12:09.917
Yes.

12:09.985 --> 12:12.153
So tell me what you saw?

12:12.220 --> 12:16.424
On the west end of the building
on the catwalk we saw a guy.

12:16.492 --> 12:17.759
Wearing?

12:17.826 --> 12:20.428
Wearing beige overalls,
baseball hat.

12:20.496 --> 12:21.862
Tall, short?

12:21.930 --> 12:24.198
You couldn't really tell.

12:24.266 --> 12:25.199
Caucasian?

12:25.267 --> 12:26.200
Uhm...

12:26.268 --> 12:30.404
Black, Latino, Asian?

12:30.471 --> 12:32.673
He was pretty far away.

12:32.740 --> 12:37.044
He was crouching down
in a suspicious manner.

12:37.112 --> 12:41.348
Suspicious how?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.152
Are you sure it was a man?

12:46.220 --> 12:48.487
I saw a gun.

12:48.555 --> 12:49.622
You actually saw it?

12:49.690 --> 12:52.692
A rifle with a scope.

12:52.759 --> 12:55.428
You saw it too?

12:55.495 --> 12:58.363
I saw a glint.

12:58.431 --> 13:02.968
[♪]

13:03.036 --> 13:08.207
Well thank you very much,
your vigilance is appreciated.

13:08.274 --> 13:12.777
Sgt. McCluskey will let you know
if we need anything further.

13:12.846 --> 13:14.745
Okay.

13:20.319 --> 13:22.119
So are you going to tell
me why you're wasting your

13:22.187 --> 13:23.754
time with these clowns?

13:23.822 --> 13:25.589
They reported seeing
someone with a gun sir.

13:25.657 --> 13:28.125
With a scope, I got that.

13:28.193 --> 13:29.526
Couldn't tell if it was a
man or a woman but they

13:29.594 --> 13:31.729
both saw a scope.

13:31.796 --> 13:34.164
Come on McCluskey, you
trying to justify the hire?

13:34.232 --> 13:36.400
If Logan says that he saw
a gun then I believe him.

13:36.468 --> 13:39.470
Now your guy, he failed
to stop an assault.

13:39.537 --> 13:41.605
So what does he do, he
sees another threat to

13:41.673 --> 13:42.606
redeem himself.

13:42.674 --> 13:44.808
That's not who he is sir.

13:44.876 --> 13:47.276
This convention is going
to choose the next leader of

13:47.344 --> 13:50.312
the party, maybe even choose
the next prime minister.

13:50.381 --> 13:51.647
I'm not going to shut it
down based on a couple of

13:51.715 --> 13:53.883
overactive imaginations.

13:53.950 --> 14:00.155
If there is an imminent
threat bring me the evidence.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.728
I don't know; smuggling a
balloon bull of red paint

14:06.796 --> 14:08.830
into a hotel and sneaking
a big ass rifle into a

14:08.898 --> 14:11.600
convention are two
very different things.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.734
No I know.

14:12.802 --> 14:14.335
I know what I saw.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.671
You saw the guy
up there too.

14:16.739 --> 14:18.939
Yeah, but if he was just
daydreaming or something.

14:19.007 --> 14:20.474
I mean you know, you're
looking down at the crowd

14:20.542 --> 14:22.476
from the catwalk, you
think oh, maybe this is

14:22.544 --> 14:24.478
how Oswald felt.
I don't know.

14:24.546 --> 14:26.647
Right but this
was different.

14:26.715 --> 14:29.950
The guy, he had intent, it
was like he was lining up

14:30.018 --> 14:33.387
his target.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.322
Well, the guy could
be anywhere.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.741
Hey.

14:55.809 --> 14:57.042
Its everything I saw and
heard when I connected

14:57.109 --> 14:59.010
with the guy.

14:59.078 --> 15:02.915
Weapon being assembled,
voices saying metal lamb...

15:02.982 --> 15:07.819
It was all bathed
in red light.

15:09.154 --> 15:13.424
Okay metal lamb.

15:13.492 --> 15:16.160
In Chinese astrology it
signifies both the years

15:16.227 --> 15:18.930
1931 and 1991.

15:18.997 --> 15:20.998
I'm not sure the Asian
community is particularly

15:21.066 --> 15:22.399
upset with Legree.

15:22.467 --> 15:23.867
Is there anything else?

15:23.935 --> 15:26.235
The only other reference
I get is a metal hair

15:26.303 --> 15:29.205
barrette with a
cute little lamb design.

15:29.273 --> 15:31.708
Maybe he pissed off a
bunch of 13-year-old girls.

15:31.776 --> 15:33.076
Then there's
no saving him.

15:33.143 --> 15:35.044
Keep digging.

15:35.112 --> 15:37.681
Everyone's on alert between
IIB and Hall security,

15:37.748 --> 15:39.782
we're going to find this
guy assuming he is there.

15:39.850 --> 15:42.451
He's here, I saw him.

15:44.087 --> 15:47.422
I'll let you know if
I need anything else.

15:51.528 --> 15:53.629
Hey dude, come on, you
did your duty right.

15:53.697 --> 15:55.129
You called it in.

15:55.197 --> 15:56.631
There's security guards
everywhere and outside is

15:56.699 --> 15:57.832
teeming with cops.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.768
So what more
can you do, huh?

16:06.308 --> 16:16.750
[♪]

16:16.818 --> 16:19.119
- Woah, woah
- Level "C" chest pains?

16:19.186 --> 16:20.120
Chest pains?

16:20.187 --> 16:21.454
Yeah.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.756
Level "C", chest pains,
loss of breath.

16:23.824 --> 16:27.360
- Guy, this is Level "E"
- Yeah that's what I said, Level "E".

16:27.428 --> 16:28.861
"E" as in 'echo'.

16:28.929 --> 16:33.765
Echo, on no, sorry I meant
"C" as in <i>chalupa</i>....

17:43.031 --> 17:44.199
Stay right there!

17:49.575 --> 17:51.509
You call our supervisor?

17:51.577 --> 17:52.577
He's on his way.

17:52.645 --> 17:54.512
Oh great.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.915
Now would one of you
gentleman like to tell me

17:56.982 --> 18:00.117
why one of our
confidential informants

18:00.185 --> 18:02.285
faked his way into
a restricted area?

18:02.353 --> 18:07.024
This is bananas; we're not
a threat, we came to you.

18:07.091 --> 18:08.592
Unfortunately.

18:08.660 --> 18:09.726
Sir if you'll just hand
them over to me

18:09.794 --> 18:13.296
I promise this won't happen again.

18:16.233 --> 18:18.601
So maybe it wasn't the
best idea to go up there.

18:18.635 --> 18:21.136
My boss has you pegged as
the one who cried wolf.

18:21.204 --> 18:24.073
Only there is a wolf and
his intentions are lethal.

18:24.140 --> 18:26.075
You, Totes... back
to the ambulance.

18:26.142 --> 18:29.679
You come with me.

18:29.746 --> 18:30.913
[inaudible]

18:30.981 --> 18:33.949
Metal and vents going
down the barrel.

18:35.250 --> 18:36.818
No, shorter than this and

18:36.886 --> 18:38.252
the quick was in the
middle of the gun.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.886
That doesn't sound
like a rifle.

18:39.888 --> 18:41.022
That's what I
saw in his head.

18:41.090 --> 18:42.390
There was also two magazines,

18:42.458 --> 18:44.692
one in the front,
one behind the grip.

18:44.759 --> 18:45.493
[♪]

18:45.561 --> 18:48.463
- Very close to that one.
- Yeah?

18:48.530 --> 18:50.163
That's it right there!

18:50.231 --> 18:52.566
Wow, that's not some nut job with

18:52.567 --> 18:54.400
daddy's hunting rifle;
that's some serious hardware.

18:54.402 --> 18:55.402
How serious?

18:55.470 --> 18:57.104
Only pros walk around with
these... law enforcement,

18:57.171 --> 18:59.506
anti-terrorists squads, military.

18:59.574 --> 19:02.076
Spires makes a big deal about
having served in Afghanistan.

19:02.143 --> 19:07.513
The metal lamb thing could
be code for battle op.

19:07.581 --> 19:11.383
If he's ex-military, what if
Legree is not the target;

19:11.451 --> 19:13.352
what if it's actually Spires?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.387
From now on. no assumptions,

19:15.455 --> 19:19.225
the target could be
on either candidate.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.535
Sir, this was all a
big misunderstanding.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.238
Seems to be both of your
fortes. Where's Logan?

19:33.305 --> 19:35.907
He's still filling
them in on what he saw.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.408
You know I could have been slicing

19:37.476 --> 19:38.976
golf balls into the trees today.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.277
How do you think I feel
about having togigive that up?

19:40.345 --> 19:43.714
Not particularly happy.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.560
Well I'm guessing you gentlemen
will be getting my next round.

19:46.584 --> 19:47.985
No, absolutely.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.520
My friend Eric knows this
great strip bar,

19:49.587 --> 19:51.922
we can head there after
work and it's like...

19:51.990 --> 19:53.423
Round of golf Mr. Bay.

19:53.491 --> 19:54.423
Of course.

19:54.491 --> 19:55.925
A round of golf!

19:55.993 --> 19:57.326
Right, I don't know why
I said strip club,

19:57.394 --> 19:58.628
they're not even...

19:58.696 --> 19:59.896
Shut up. I'm going to
walk away now.

19:59.964 --> 20:00.897
Cool.

20:00.965 --> 20:02.365
I'll be here then.

20:02.432 --> 20:04.901
I'll just stop... stand
here and stop talking.

20:06.671 --> 20:07.937
Can I help you?

20:08.005 --> 20:09.805
Sgt. Mcususkey, IIB.

20:09.873 --> 20:11.874
Robert Vinto,
Chief of Security.

20:11.908 --> 20:13.075
Do you have a minute?

20:13.143 --> 20:15.243
Mr. Spires isn't
available at the moment.

20:15.311 --> 20:18.446
We're looking into possible
threats against the candidates.

20:18.514 --> 20:22.051
Anything that rises to a
level of serious concern?

20:22.152 --> 20:24.820
Ever seen one of these?

20:24.888 --> 20:26.821
DSR1 bull-pup.

20:26.889 --> 20:29.257
German Army uses something like
it to base defense up NORAD.

20:29.325 --> 20:31.693
You ever seen it
used domestically?

20:31.760 --> 20:33.328
Trade shows in the States.

20:33.396 --> 20:37.365
It's a SWAT weapon, long
distance tool, very specialized.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.267
You were over
there with Col. Spires?

20:39.335 --> 20:41.803
Yes ma'am, Private,
2nd battalion.

20:41.870 --> 20:45.872

20:45.940 --> 20:48.809
<i>[hearing spell]</i>
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

20:50.378 --> 20:53.046
You agree with the Col.
about pulling out of the war?

20:53.114 --> 20:54.981
We lost a lot of good
people fighting over a

20:55.049 --> 20:57.751
useless patch of territory
that wasn't worth dying for.

20:57.819 --> 21:00.653
Do the words metal lamb
mean anything to you?

21:00.721 --> 21:02.288
<i>[hearing spell] How</i>
<i>does she know about that?</i>

21:02.356 --> 21:04.257

21:12.099 --> 21:16.201
Sorry, no idea.

21:16.269 --> 21:18.103
Thank you for your time.

21:26.178 --> 21:27.512
He's lying.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.348
He was thinking about an
argument or something,

21:29.415 --> 21:33.317
a struggle in a military
tent. It wasn't too clear.

21:33.385 --> 21:37.855
I heard the words,
'they're all dead metal lamb'.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.992
Okay what's he hiding?

21:42.060 --> 21:44.328
These soldiers were in the
same unit as Ventone.

21:44.396 --> 21:46.063
Did you see any of them
when you were bouncing

21:46.131 --> 21:47.664
around in his head?

21:47.732 --> 21:49.666
That guy right there, that's
the guy saying metal lamb.

21:49.734 --> 21:51.635
Private Scott Flynn.

21:51.702 --> 21:55.138
And this is the woman he tangled
with when he freaked out.

21:55.205 --> 21:58.608
Corinne Romley,
his top advisor.

21:58.676 --> 22:00.277
You think Flynn's
our shooter?

22:00.344 --> 22:03.545
Well that would be some trick;
Flynn never made it home.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.546
MIA and presumed dead.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.882
[♪]

22:12.628 --> 22:14.762
So whatever went wrong
that day in the desert,

22:14.830 --> 22:16.197
this incident that
you've been seeing,

22:16.264 --> 22:19.100
you think that's what
is driving the shooter?

22:19.167 --> 22:20.534
Spires was in command of
the unit, he was the one

22:20.603 --> 22:24.105
in charge of life
and death decision.

22:24.172 --> 22:27.808
Dangerous mission, things
go sideways, Flynn blames

22:27.875 --> 22:29.910
his commanding officer.

22:29.978 --> 22:33.981
Still doesn't explain how
he's back from the dead.

22:34.048 --> 22:40.453
Let's say he survives and
he makes his way home and

22:40.521 --> 22:43.355
then he dedicates
himself to one thing.

22:43.423 --> 22:45.424
Payback to the man who
sent him into battle.

22:45.492 --> 22:47.860
Yeah, it's a theory.

22:47.928 --> 22:50.796
It's all I got; you
got a better one?

22:50.864 --> 22:53.532
A discharged troop blames
blowhards like LeGree for

22:53.600 --> 22:55.635
getting us into this mess.

22:55.702 --> 22:58.436
I don't know; I'm not
ruling anything out.

23:00.106 --> 23:02.641
We're here to see
Corinne Romley.

23:03.876 --> 23:06.244
It's all for the union
okay. Every deposit...

23:06.311 --> 23:07.812
Corinne Romley,
Chief of Staff.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.016
Sgt. McCluskey IIB, we
spoke on the telephone.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.917
The kind of frenzy Legree
whips his supporters into

23:13.985 --> 23:16.453
we get our fair
share of threats.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.123
The but good news is this
is the same team that kept

23:19.190 --> 23:21.091
the Col. safe through
Kandahar, Kabul and the

23:21.159 --> 23:23.726
Shah-i-Kot Valley so
I'm sure we can get him

23:23.727 --> 23:24.928
through a political
convention without incident.

23:24.996 --> 23:25.929
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your name.

23:25.997 --> 23:27.164
Toby Logan.

23:27.231 --> 23:29.166
Let me guess, undercover?

23:30.233 --> 23:31.934
Can you think of any
reason that someone would

23:32.002 --> 23:34.336
want Mr. Spires dead?

23:34.404 --> 23:35.872
Is this just an
overabundance of caution

23:35.939 --> 23:39.275
or is there something
you'd like to share with me?

23:39.342 --> 23:43.980
What can you tell us
about Scott Flynn?

23:44.048 --> 23:46.481
What does that have to do
with the current situation?

23:46.549 --> 23:49.317
Humor us.

23:49.385 --> 23:55.590
Private Flynn disappeared
on night patrol in Jalalabad.

23:55.658 --> 23:57.159
<i>[hearing spell]</i>
<i>Flynn...</i>

23:57.226 --> 23:59.494
<i>I am not signing this</i>
<i>lie; they're all dead.</i>

23:59.562 --> 24:01.962
<i>Get a grip soldier!</i>

24:02.864 --> 24:07.534
We heard enemy fire,
he never returned.

24:07.602 --> 24:10.671
You have no idea what
that can do to a unit.

24:10.739 --> 24:12.639
Did they ever
find his body?

24:12.708 --> 24:15.076
We left him behind.

24:15.143 --> 24:18.044
Oh don't get up.

24:18.112 --> 24:19.312
Excuse me.

24:19.379 --> 24:21.715
Sagen. What?

24:21.782 --> 24:26.820
It's a hell of a thing to
go off to war with just a

24:26.887 --> 24:31.324
weapon in your hand and a
soldier at your side and

24:31.391 --> 24:37.196
one promise that you cling
to... if you fall, you will

24:37.264 --> 24:41.200
not be left behind.

24:41.268 --> 24:45.338
We failed him,
pure and simple.

24:45.405 --> 24:48.541
Now I assume this is about
that unfortunate attack on

24:48.609 --> 24:50.008
Mr. Legree?

24:50.076 --> 24:52.076
No sir, we have the man
responsible for that.

24:52.144 --> 24:53.645
Good, good.

24:53.713 --> 24:55.179
We think there may be a
much larger threat against

24:55.248 --> 24:57.815
you, Col. Spires.

24:57.883 --> 24:59.551
Really?

24:59.619 --> 25:01.853
I'm thinking Spires was
there when it all went down.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.888
Same incident
in the barracks.

25:03.956 --> 25:05.624
Yeah, this time I saw bodies
lined up on the ground.

25:05.691 --> 25:07.491
Enemy soldiers
or their own?

25:07.559 --> 25:11.094
Not sure, look like a family
that were covered in sheets.

25:11.162 --> 25:14.831
Well whatever it was, that
puts Spires, Ventone and

25:14.899 --> 25:17.601
Corinne Romley together
with Private Flynn

25:17.669 --> 25:20.871
sometime before
Flynn goes missing.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.072
I'm going to get
Dev down here.

25:22.140 --> 25:23.406
Come with me, I'm
going to need you.

25:25.008 --> 25:26.175
Ouch!

25:26.243 --> 25:27.610
Why are you using
one-inch staples.

25:27.678 --> 25:29.512
So it doesn't come off when
you're waving it around.

25:29.580 --> 25:30.846
Mission accomplished.

25:30.914 --> 25:32.414
You know next time you
should just use one of

25:32.415 --> 25:33.215
those big foam fingers.

25:33.284 --> 25:34.784
Just get it
off me damn it.

25:34.851 --> 25:36.752
Mr. Bay can you explain to
this man that we're trying

25:36.753 --> 25:38.520
to help him and his
attitude isn't helping?

25:38.588 --> 25:40.921
What my boss is trying to
say is that we are trying

25:40.922 --> 25:42.424
to help you and your
attitude isn't helping.

25:42.492 --> 25:44.058
Ever [inaudible] as a kid?

25:45.461 --> 25:47.829
Thank you sir.

25:47.897 --> 25:49.964
I dug this out of
the security tapes.

25:50.032 --> 25:51.466
Tell me if this
is your guy?

25:51.534 --> 25:54.770
Yeah, that's him; beige
overalls, baseball hat.

25:54.837 --> 25:57.071
Comes out in about a
minute... fast forward.

25:57.139 --> 26:02.376
[♪]

26:02.444 --> 26:03.678
Do you think that
could be Flynn?

26:03.745 --> 26:05.479
Can't make out his face.

26:05.547 --> 26:09.017
He didn't go with a bag but
he's coming out with it.

26:09.084 --> 26:10.518
So he didn't go up there
to plant the gun, he went

26:10.585 --> 26:13.520
up there to pick it up.

26:13.587 --> 26:16.323
Which is how he must have
gotten past security.

26:16.390 --> 26:18.692
Dev alert all units to
search for this guy.

26:18.759 --> 26:32.338
[♪]

26:32.339 --> 26:41.013
[♪]

26:41.014 --> 26:48.553
[♪]

26:59.397 --> 27:03.267
Geez, give a guy
a heart attack.

27:03.335 --> 27:04.668
Didn't know you
were up here man.

27:04.736 --> 27:06.703
Just finishing a
sweep; it's all good.

27:11.243 --> 27:15.378

<i>They're all dead.</i>

27:26.182 --> 27:28.283
<i>I am not signing</i>
<i>their lies.</i>

27:28.351 --> 27:37.458
[♪]

27:37.525 --> 27:41.229
So there I was baby in one hand,
the fire was so close I could...

27:41.296 --> 27:44.431
Listen Sgt. I want to
apologize for the...

27:44.499 --> 27:45.900
All right maybe you
can apologize now for

27:45.968 --> 27:48.236
interrupting me.

27:48.303 --> 27:50.436
So just keep this immobilized
as possible, you know

27:50.504 --> 27:54.341
I recommend that you take an
X-ray just to make sure.

27:54.408 --> 27:55.909
Excuse me.

27:55.977 --> 27:58.378
[beeping]

27:58.445 --> 28:00.580
Superficial
burns backstage.

28:00.647 --> 28:03.250
Yeah, okay, well Mr. Bay
and I can handle that.

28:03.317 --> 28:06.919
Thank you very much, ma'am.
It was nice meeting you.

28:08.255 --> 28:09.588
You're on duty back here.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.623
Yeah well, you know, the
cops are probably done

28:11.624 --> 28:13.192
with me anyway, so....

28:13.260 --> 28:16.527
You know Logan? Not that
you're asking but you know

28:16.528 --> 28:19.531
where I'd be if I
screwed up the way you do?

28:19.599 --> 28:21.565
You probably wouldn't be
wearing that gray shirt...

28:21.633 --> 28:24.302
Probably not
gainfully employed.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.770
Right.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.038
Pain in the neck.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.472
No, sort of have
a little headache.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.607
No, I mean you!

28:29.674 --> 28:31.542
[laughter]

28:36.715 --> 28:39.682
Now I don't know why you
and your partner were

28:39.750 --> 28:42.085
requested for this detail
but I got to figure

28:42.153 --> 28:43.553
there's a reason.

28:43.621 --> 28:47.324
All I ask is that someday
you tell me what it is.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.226
Sure.

28:54.564 --> 28:56.432
Flynn's only family is a
brother named Jackson back

28:56.433 --> 28:58.167
in Edmonton; still haven't
been able to reach him though.

28:58.235 --> 28:59.701
What about the weapon?

28:59.769 --> 29:01.370
There's three SWAT teams
in Canada testing the

29:01.438 --> 29:04.340
bull-pup sniper rifle; London,
Quebec City and Edmonton.

29:04.408 --> 29:05.741
I got calls
into all three.

29:05.809 --> 29:07.509
Well Flynn is from
Edmonton; why don't you

29:07.577 --> 29:08.945
see if there's
a connection.

29:09.012 --> 29:10.979
The minute those doors
open, the bodies pile in

29:11.047 --> 29:12.681
it's going to be a lot
harder to find our guy.

29:12.749 --> 29:16.552
Thank you. Dev your optimism
is always appreciated.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.754
How did they get the name?

29:18.822 --> 29:20.422
I don't know!

29:20.490 --> 29:22.891
Look she asked me to the words
'metal lamb' mean anything?

29:22.959 --> 29:24.326
God!

29:24.393 --> 29:25.626
Should we tell them?

29:25.694 --> 29:28.796
No!

29:28.864 --> 29:30.164
Take care of it.

29:31.867 --> 29:33.634
[knock]

29:33.702 --> 29:35.035
Hey, hey.

29:35.103 --> 29:36.236
Sorry I got you in
trouble with your boss.

29:36.304 --> 29:37.237
I guess I could
say the same thing.

29:37.305 --> 29:38.238
Grab a chair man.

29:38.306 --> 29:41.075
Sure.

29:41.142 --> 29:42.776
What's going on?

29:42.844 --> 29:44.744
I had to circumvent a few
firewalls and spoof an IP

29:44.812 --> 29:48.181
but I got to some way
deep military records.

29:48.248 --> 29:50.517
Metal Lamb is
actually Methar Lam.

29:50.585 --> 29:53.920
It's a town 47 km
northwest of Jalalabad.

29:53.988 --> 29:55.321
Impressive.

29:55.389 --> 29:57.624
You got your
skills, I got mine.

29:57.692 --> 30:00.759
2006 Spires unit
was in the area.

30:00.827 --> 30:03.196
Here's the
official report.

30:03.263 --> 30:05.465
While they were patrolling
outside a cluster of towns

30:05.532 --> 30:08.334
east of the town the Taliban
came in and wiped out the farmers.

30:08.402 --> 30:11.604
Cable news reporter Donna
Tadeo saw the incident.

30:11.671 --> 30:14.072
<i>"Eight bodies all</i>
<i>attributed to a brutal</i>

30:14.140 --> 30:15.540
<i>Taliban attack.</i>

30:15.608 --> 30:17.242
<i>Now these villagers have</i>
<i>all been accused of</i>

30:17.310 --> 30:19.878
<i>cooperating with allied</i>
<i>soldiers, something as of</i>

30:19.945 --> 30:22.314
<i>yet that has not</i>
<i>been confirmed."</i>

30:22.382 --> 30:25.417
Two weeks later
Flynn goes MIA.

30:25.485 --> 30:28.553
They're all dead, Methar
Lam... that's what Flynn

30:28.621 --> 30:30.122
was talking
about, the attack.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.925
It feels like a cover-up.

30:35.561 --> 30:37.595
This reeks of a last
minute political smear.

30:37.663 --> 30:40.231
Well I believe there is a
dangerous person out there

30:40.298 --> 30:42.033
who's motivated by
something that happened

30:42.100 --> 30:43.635
back in Afghanistan.

30:43.702 --> 30:46.237
Is that right?

30:47.005 --> 30:49.606
Why did Flynn let you
down back in Methar Lamb?

30:49.674 --> 30:52.776
He didn't let us
down; we let him down.

30:52.844 --> 30:54.011
What do you mean?

30:54.078 --> 30:57.915
I'm sitting
here; he isn't.

30:57.982 --> 31:00.283
<i>[hearing spell]</i>
<i>We murdered those people.</i>

31:01.318 --> 31:04.286
<i>Jackson, it's Scott...</i>
<i>I'm in deep here.</i>

31:04.354 --> 31:07.757
<i>Look at the Methar Lamb...</i>

31:07.824 --> 31:10.992
We know Flynn was making
satellite phone calls back home.

31:11.093 --> 31:13.663
he told someone what happened.

31:13.730 --> 31:15.965
He wasn't supposed to
be making calls was he?

31:19.268 --> 31:21.036
<i>[hearing spell]</i>
<i>How do they know all this;</i>

31:21.103 --> 31:22.871
<i>I'm being set up.</i>

31:22.939 --> 31:26.240
Who was he calling?
He wasn't married.

31:26.308 --> 31:29.978
<i>[hearing spell]</i>
<i>Ventone selling me down the river.</i>

31:30.046 --> 31:33.615
You don't want to end
up wearing all this.

31:33.683 --> 31:38.218
You got to tell
the Sgt. everything.

31:40.689 --> 31:42.322
He had an older brother
who lived in Edmonton.

31:42.390 --> 31:43.924
He called him every week
on Satellite phone.

31:43.992 --> 31:47.661
It was his
emotional lifeline.

31:47.729 --> 31:49.529
So he told him
what he saw.

31:49.598 --> 31:51.497
We didn't talk about
what we saw over there.

31:51.565 --> 31:53.800
I wish I could
forget what I saw.

31:53.867 --> 31:55.101
We were chasing phantoms.

31:55.168 --> 31:56.736
And you thought
you found them.

31:56.804 --> 32:00.139
[hearing spell] <i>Stop now, stop.</i>
<i>Don't say another word.</i>

32:00.207 --> 32:02.575
Ventone says you
were responsible,

32:02.643 --> 32:05.311
that it was your call.

32:05.378 --> 32:08.480
That's a lie; we had
intelligence reports,

32:08.547 --> 32:10.148
we had reliable
intelligence reports.

32:10.216 --> 32:14.519
They were holed up
in that farmhouse.

32:14.587 --> 32:16.021
So there was not any
Taliban fighters in that

32:16.089 --> 32:19.190
farmhouse was there?

32:20.593 --> 32:24.194
Flynn wouldn't go along
with the cover-up.

32:24.262 --> 32:28.465
He was a standup guy.

32:28.533 --> 32:30.835
<i>[hearing spell]</i>
<i>Look into Methar Lamb...</i>

32:42.079 --> 32:46.516
We know Col. Spires shot Flynn;
you're covering up for him.

32:46.583 --> 32:48.551
You've got to stop
protecting him.

32:48.619 --> 32:51.487

32:51.555 --> 32:54.923
You don't understand;
it was an accident.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.084
Well if you ask
me, neither one of

33:06.151 --> 33:08.553
these mothers is
worth voting for.

33:08.621 --> 33:11.955
Yeah, the law of probabilities
being what it is,

33:12.023 --> 33:14.958
I guess one of them has to
win this thing, right.

33:15.026 --> 33:20.598
It's like choosing between
mayonnaise and white bread.

33:20.665 --> 33:24.067
I don't even
like mayonnaise.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.202
You know I should
go into politics.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.204
You should sir.

33:28.272 --> 33:29.572
Yeah, I got
something to say.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.409
Yeah you are totally
full of opinions, yeah.

33:32.476 --> 33:36.078
You know what, you'd have my
vote, right off the bat.

33:36.146 --> 33:40.550
You patronizing
me Mr. Bay?

33:40.618 --> 33:42.818
No.

33:44.287 --> 33:46.688
Contact Kline and the
Military Prosecution Service,

33:46.699 --> 33:48.223
find out how we proceed
on this thing.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.392
What about Spires; do we wait
until after the convention?

33:50.460 --> 33:52.027
First I want to hear
everything you have.

33:52.094 --> 33:55.297
Well the MIA soldier's
brother, Jackson, turns

33:55.364 --> 33:57.799
out he's a 12-year vet
of the Edmonton police.

33:57.866 --> 33:59.901
He's a SWAT team sniper.

33:59.968 --> 34:01.569
He spent the last four
years lobbying both the

34:01.637 --> 34:03.904
military and politicians to
look into his brother's death.

34:03.972 --> 34:05.406
But nothing came
of it no doubt.

34:05.473 --> 34:06.873
They shut him down.

34:06.942 --> 34:09.376
His last few emails accuse
the army of cover-up.

34:09.444 --> 34:12.179
Sir, Flynn was on the
phone with his brother

34:12.246 --> 34:14.982
filling him in on the
attacks when he was killed.

34:15.050 --> 34:16.382
That's not all.

34:16.451 --> 34:18.185
The brother took a leave
from the Edmonton police

34:18.253 --> 34:19.618
four weeks ago.

34:19.686 --> 34:20.585
They haven't been able to
reach him but they just

34:20.654 --> 34:22.054
sent me his photo.

34:22.121 --> 34:23.722
Are you telling me we have
a SWAT sniper gone rouge

34:23.790 --> 34:25.058
and no one can find him?

34:25.125 --> 34:26.326
There's got to be a list
of everyone who has

34:26.393 --> 34:27.860
authorized access to
the Convention Hall.

34:27.928 --> 34:29.795
I already cross referenced
names but now I can plug in

34:29.862 --> 34:32.630
the fish where I can... it
will just take me a second.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.966
Why don't you go back down
to the convention floor

34:34.967 --> 34:35.900
and see if you
can get anything.

34:35.905 --> 34:36.935
- Sure
- Okay.

34:39.839 --> 34:41.206
Not good.

34:41.274 --> 34:43.141
Jackson Flynn used
an assumed name.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.509
He's working security.

34:44.577 --> 34:46.344
Got his temporary
assignment three weeks ago.

34:46.411 --> 34:48.347
Unbelievable.

34:48.414 --> 34:49.914
Well that explains why
your 'sweeps' keep coming

34:49.983 --> 34:51.482
up empty and why he had
free reign to come and go.

34:51.549 --> 34:53.516
We're an hour away from
the doors opening,

34:53.518 --> 34:54.418
get the word out now.

34:54.485 --> 34:56.187
I want every cop in
this building checked.

34:56.254 --> 34:58.589
I want this man found
and until he is,

34:58.656 --> 35:00.191
this Convention
does not go forward.

35:00.258 --> 35:02.093
We have to keep Spires
away from the Convention floor,

35:02.160 --> 35:03.760
it's the sniper's kill zone.

35:03.828 --> 35:06.830
Too late... that looks like an
impromptu press conference;

35:06.898 --> 35:07.998
that's going out live.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.265
We need to get down there.

35:09.333 --> 35:10.733
Alert our people
on the floor.

35:10.801 --> 35:12.168
[♪]

35:12.236 --> 35:13.636
Now I've been getting a
lot of questions in this

35:13.704 --> 35:16.839
campaign about what we
intend to do financially...

35:16.907 --> 35:18.941
and well we've come up
with a budget answer.

35:19.010 --> 35:20.910
Keep looking, I want a
twenty on every security

35:20.978 --> 35:22.312
guard in the building.

35:22.380 --> 35:25.854
Let's do this quietly. I don't
want chaos on national television.

35:26.158 --> 35:32.854
[♪]

35:32.922 --> 35:42.963
[speech in background]

35:43.032 --> 35:45.199
...tax cuts on daycare
expenses...

35:45.267 --> 35:48.202
..they'll be good
for Canadian families.

35:48.270 --> 35:51.539
We're looking into
universal childcare...

35:51.606 --> 36:00.914
[♪]

36:00.981 --> 36:02.682
[speech in background]

36:02.750 --> 36:12.491
[♪]

36:12.559 --> 36:15.127
We will not be closing
down any prisons.

36:15.195 --> 36:18.697
Now Mr. Legree says he has a
plan, we haven't heard anything.

36:18.765 --> 36:26.605
[♪]

36:26.606 --> 36:34.011
[♪]

36:34.080 --> 36:36.013
Don't do it Jackson!

36:36.082 --> 36:37.549
Your brother wouldn't
have wanted this.

36:37.616 --> 36:40.017
Spires murdered him.

36:40.086 --> 36:43.554
Thank you very much for your
time ladies and gentlemen.

36:43.621 --> 36:45.522
You've proved your point.

36:45.590 --> 36:46.923
Step away from the weapon.

36:46.991 --> 36:48.492
He has to pay
for what he did.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.828
Spires buckled under the
pressure, Scott didn't.

36:51.896 --> 36:54.198
He stayed true to his
oath as a soldier.

36:54.265 --> 36:56.266
I heard him dying!

36:56.334 --> 36:58.602
I know you did.

36:58.669 --> 37:02.071
This isn't going
to bring him back.

37:02.139 --> 37:05.441
Step away from the weapon.

37:05.509 --> 37:12.148
[♪]

37:12.216 --> 37:13.949
If you love your brother,
don't dishonor him.

37:14.017 --> 37:16.351
There's going to be a
military investigation;

37:16.419 --> 37:17.552
the truth will come out.

37:17.621 --> 37:20.155
[♪]

37:20.223 --> 37:28.931
[crying]

37:28.999 --> 37:33.567
[♪]

37:33.636 --> 37:35.436
[crying]

37:35.504 --> 37:41.843
[♪]

37:41.844 --> 37:49.349
[♪]

37:50.251 --> 37:51.752
[knock]

37:52.820 --> 37:54.320
So we're good?

37:54.388 --> 37:56.222
The superintendent has
agreed to let me keep

37:56.290 --> 38:00.661
confidential informant
A1138... discreetly.

38:00.728 --> 38:03.429
Alright, so he didn't
ask any questions.

38:03.497 --> 38:07.466
As long as he gets results he
doesn't want to know anything.

38:07.534 --> 38:10.502
The Army has reopened the case
on the Methar Lam incident.

38:10.570 --> 38:13.438
They are also looking for
Flynn in Afghanistan.

38:13.506 --> 38:16.742
For now they're classifying
it as friendly fire.

38:16.810 --> 38:19.545
And what about
Corinne Romley's statement?

38:19.612 --> 38:24.515
Military investigations are
slow and behind closed doors.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.350
But you know what?
it's going to take a while,

38:26.418 --> 38:29.721
we'll keep the pressure on
and we're going to nail Spires.

38:29.789 --> 38:33.424
Can you believe that guy almost
became the next Prime Minister?

38:33.492 --> 38:36.426
The good thing about politics
is close doesn't count.

38:36.494 --> 38:37.661
Right.

38:37.729 --> 38:39.930
Horse shoes, darts...

38:39.998 --> 38:52.742
[♪]

38:52.810 --> 38:54.410
And another beer for you.

38:54.477 --> 38:55.978
Oh I'm going to
switch to water.

38:56.046 --> 38:58.447
What's wrong? you never
met a brew you didn't like.

38:58.515 --> 39:01.050
I know, I just wanted to start taking
a little bit better care of myself.

39:01.118 --> 39:03.519
You know I can't back you
up at work if I'm hung over.

39:03.587 --> 39:04.887
True, yeah.

39:04.955 --> 39:06.522
Well why can't you turn
over this new leaf

39:06.590 --> 39:09.057
tomorrow; that would
be much better.

39:09.125 --> 39:11.492
Why, what's
the difference?

39:11.560 --> 39:12.828
[knock]

39:12.895 --> 39:14.796
Hey. Come on it.

39:15.732 --> 39:16.698
Hi...

39:16.766 --> 39:19.300
hey...

39:20.402 --> 39:21.703
Hey Sandy.

39:21.771 --> 39:23.138
What are you doing here?

39:23.206 --> 39:26.040
I'm here to play cards...
didn't Toby tell you?

39:26.108 --> 39:27.942
Slipped my mind.

39:28.009 --> 39:29.110
Where's Olivia?

39:29.177 --> 39:30.277
She's on her way.

39:30.345 --> 39:32.146
Whoa, what'd
you bring here?

39:32.214 --> 39:36.450
Oh I've got brie,
cranberry jalapeño jelly

39:36.517 --> 39:37.517
and salt water crackers.

39:37.585 --> 39:39.853
And what is
wrong with chips?

39:39.920 --> 39:42.722
I don't do junk. Sue me.

39:42.790 --> 39:45.524
What I need is a drink
because this Zinfandel

39:45.592 --> 39:46.793
is calling my name.

39:46.861 --> 39:48.561
Can I pour you some?

39:48.629 --> 39:50.830
He can't, he's turning
over a new leaf.

39:50.898 --> 39:53.299
Yes, yeah, I am turning
over a new leaf...

39:53.367 --> 39:57.903
from beer to wine...
so this is perfect.

39:57.971 --> 39:58.904
Antioxidants, right?

39:58.972 --> 40:00.438
Excellent.

40:00.506 --> 40:02.107
Why don't you pour
yourself a glass and then

40:02.175 --> 40:04.176
get me a straw
for the rest.

40:04.244 --> 40:06.745
A woman after my own
heart... Sandy Wardwell!

40:06.813 --> 40:07.980
Nice.
