WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.254
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.420 --> 00:04.888
- Lyla.
- We need to talk about John.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.761
<i>He's back in the country.
And he's in prison.</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:08.016
<i>We are gonna break him out.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.176
Hey, John.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.811
I'm not saying you shouldn't do
your penance.

00:10.969 --> 00:11.970
<i>But do it as Spartan.</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:15.107
Church is planning something.
Something big.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.391
You're talking about the Trust.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.936
At least we definitely know
where Church is now.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.103
We gotta put him down.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.564
Go. Do not die.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.526
- Get him to safety.
- But...

00:25.692 --> 00:26.864
Go!

00:29.238 --> 00:30.956
Don't kill him. He may have his uses.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.208
We are not gonna write off Rene.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.211
We're gonna find him.
We're gonna bring him back.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.371
<i>Wherever he is.</i>

00:47.256 --> 00:50.510
The Trust goes
to the Brace, 04 in 72.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.475
How you feeling, my friend?

00:57.641 --> 00:59.609
You can keep
going with the foreplay,

00:59.768 --> 01:01.645
but I'm never giving you what you want.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.565
<i>You remind me of this other guy
I once tortured.</i>

01:04.855 --> 01:08.406
Maybe bigger,
a little more muscle on the frame.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.331
Look, I was conversing
with this son of a bitch

01:16.618 --> 01:21.670
just like you and I have been
conversing for the past...

01:22.499 --> 01:24.752
What, 20 hours or so?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.012
<i>My knuckles hurt.</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:31.175
Even with the brass. I needed a shower.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.343
My lady was waiting for me.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.231
And this guy
would just not give me what I needed.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.895
Not unlike you.

01:39.975 --> 01:43.024
So I said to myself, "Tobias,

01:43.228 --> 01:47.233
"make this guy feel pain
like nobody who's ever lived."

01:48.692 --> 01:50.194
And then it clicked.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.290
It's not the pain that breaks people.

01:56.742 --> 01:57.868
<i>It's fear.</i>

01:58.702 --> 02:00.830
Fear of that pain.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.919
Of what that pain brings.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.048
Of what happens next.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.511
You not gonna finish your story?

02:11.882 --> 02:12.883
Huh?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.134
Oh.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.933
I got what I wanted from that guy.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.611
So you might wanna think about that
the next time I ask you a question.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.697
Tobias Church. Where is he?

02:32.069 --> 02:34.071
Don't know. Even if I did,

02:34.237 --> 02:36.410
whatever you're gonna do to me,
he's worse.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.119
How sure are you about that?

02:44.831 --> 02:45.832
Ahh!

02:47.834 --> 02:49.586
Hey, you're a lot cuter
than the green guy.

02:49.753 --> 02:53.178
Aww, you're kind of cute, too, in a
"I feel sorry for you" kind of way.

02:53.757 --> 02:56.010
- Where's Church?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.519
The green guy.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.729
Where is Church?

02:59.971 --> 03:01.063
Look out!

03:10.691 --> 03:11.692
You Okay?

03:11.942 --> 03:13.194
I'm better than this schmuck.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.284
Church. Address. Now.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.241
I heard he's somewhere northwest of here,
maybe by the water.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.701
Half the city's on the water.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.084
I swear, that's all I know.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.089
Come on.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.300
How's it going?

03:36.508 --> 03:39.728
I would punch this monitor
if I didn't know how much it cost.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.980
Also, it'd probably really hurt.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.640
Can you get off your feet, please?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.563
Oliver told me that you were back to work

03:45.726 --> 03:47.569
a week after you were shot
by the Clock King.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.813
Shot in the shoulder.
Not a knife in the back.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.152
I don't need you to remind me.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.066
I have excruciating agony to do that.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.280
Who's that?

03:58.488 --> 03:59.535
Hmm? Telemarketer.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.452
Tell me you've had better luck
than I have had.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.996
We might have narrowed it down
to the northwest part of the city.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.045
Yeah, so now we're looking for a needle
in a slightly smaller haystack.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.507
I'll run an algorithm cross-referencing
traffic cams with probable locations.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.218
Wow. This place just got really crowded.

04:16.505 --> 04:17.507
<i>He'!-</i>

04:17.673 --> 04:20.348
Do people just walk into
your secret base of operations?

04:20.510 --> 04:21.511
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.396
- This is...
- Spartan.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.602
I'm guessing.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.392
You guys must the new kids on the block.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.936
We're more like the Backstreet Boys.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.858
It was funny in my head.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.023
This is Rory Regan and Evelyn Sharp.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.864
John Diggle. And you are missing a man.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.027
<i>Rene Ramirez.</i>

04:37.194 --> 04:40.038
Lyla called in A.R.G.U.S. for the search.
Unfortunately, she's turned up nothing.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.244
It's going around.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.459
We are going to find Rene,
and we're not gonna give up hope

04:44.618 --> 04:45.619
while we're doing it.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.793
I have an early meeting at City Hall,
I will check in with everybody soon.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.679
Is it just my imagination,
or did Oliver just seem...

04:55.879 --> 04:59.099
Optimistic. That's not usually a word
I'd associate with his demeanor.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.805
- Thank you.
- Rene?

05:07.766 --> 05:09.609
<i>- Slow.
- What about the ACU?</i>

05:10.060 --> 05:12.279
Too many cops on Church's dime
keeping him five steps ahead.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.403
And with Conahan gone
and Church's assault on the ACU,

05:15.565 --> 05:17.067
I'm thinking we gotta bring
more men into the fold.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.827
Well, do we have enough guys
that we can trust?

05:18.985 --> 05:22.239
Pike says that a bunch of his men
have volunteered since the attack on ACU.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.873
So, if you want, I can vet 'em,
and I could,

05:24.032 --> 05:25.124
you know,
make sure there's no bad apples.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.580
Please. Let's get that done.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.920
Look, I know
this is one of the last things

05:29.120 --> 05:32.124
you wanna be dealing with right now,
but the re-zoning vote is in a few days.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.253
Allowing us to expand
low-income housing in Orchid Bay?

05:36.419 --> 05:37.420
Yeah, yeah.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.180
Okay, well, we need
a four-fifths majority vote

05:39.381 --> 05:41.099
from City Council in order to pass
the ordinance and...

05:41.258 --> 05:42.259
Who are the hold-outs?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.936
Only one that really matters.
Councilman Kullens.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.439
Yeah, he is decidedly anti-residential.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.100
I was gonna say,
he's the most stubborn man in the city

05:50.267 --> 05:52.816
compared to you, but that works.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.237
Let's get into it.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.279
Anatoly, what is this?

06:02.445 --> 06:04.288
It is time, my friend.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.180
English will suffice, Viktor.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.720
Fine.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.180
What does Bratva mean to you,
Oliver Queen?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.932
Brotherhood.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.851
<i>Brotherhood is family.</i>

06:33.643 --> 06:34.769
Who are yours?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.233
My father is dead.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.816
- My mother and sister...
- Both dead.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.737
Bratva only know their brothers.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.869
Do you know what I mean by this?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.161
I have no family.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.290
I have no home. I have no name.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.199
We're at the latest probable, Overwatch,
but it's another dead end.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.864
Try not to use that phrase.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.616
Look.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.706
- Is that...
- Blood? Looks like.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.746
Scratch that. We think this is where
Rene was being held.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.039
- "Was"?
<i>- Blood's still fresh.</i>

07:36.206 --> 07:37.253
They must've just moved him.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.378
KH-Ten shows a panel van moving
from that location 40 minutes ago.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.590
Can you track it?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.548
I have been able to every other time
somebody asked me that question.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.141
- Got it.
- Where?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.223
This is a little awkward,

07:49.719 --> 07:51.892
but Oliver made me promise that if we got
our location on Rene,

07:52.055 --> 07:53.557
I would only share it with him.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.559
That's actually not surprising at all.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.863
Lest I forget.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.402
So you can pay the ferry.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.362
Why, man?

08:06.903 --> 08:08.120
'Cause you pissed me off.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.577
NO. Why this city?

08:11.408 --> 08:12.534
<i>Why come here?</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:14.999
And why are you asking me that now?

08:15.161 --> 08:18.540
'Cause, if I'm gonna die tonight,
it'd be nice to know why.

08:19.582 --> 08:23.428
From what I heard, you were popping
in Blüdhaven, in Hub City.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.672
<i>Why you messing with us?</i>

08:29.259 --> 08:30.602
For your water access.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.642
Seriously.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.188
Through Star City's docks

08:37.642 --> 08:42.239
I can move thousands of tons of heroin,
Slam, Vertigo.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.781
I'm working on the biggest
consolidation of drug enterprises

08:46.985 --> 08:48.703
anybody has ever seen.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.705
Only thing I'm waiting for

08:50.864 --> 08:52.787
is for Green Arrow
to get out of the picture.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.455
Little man,
that grave ain't gonna dig itself.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.716
So how about you do the digging yourself?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.177
Oh, you think I'm afraid
to get my hands dirty, huh?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.197
Hey, you okay?

09:34.032 --> 09:35.784
I thought Church would put up
more of a fight.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.166
Probably realized he didn't have to.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.004
What do you mean?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.125
I was hurting so bad

09:43.291 --> 09:45.339
it got so I couldn't even see straight.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.220
I barely even remember telling him...

09:48.421 --> 09:49.513
Telling him what?

09:51.508 --> 09:52.509
Who you are.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.346
He knows you're Oliver Queen.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.358
I should've been out there
with you tonight, Oliver.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.740
Digg, you said you needed time.
Don't be afraid to take it.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.034
And tonight
would not have made any difference.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.739
Church didn't want to fight.
He wanted to run.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.700
That's because he knows killing the Mayor
is a lot easier

10:12.904 --> 10:14.121
than killing the Green Arrow.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.825
What? We were all thinking it.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.126
I told Rene to stand down and recover.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.379
Evelyn and Rory are going to watch
Thea and Quentin

10:21.538 --> 10:24.758
in case Church tries to get at me
through them. How's Curtis doing?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.125
He says he wants to get back at it.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.507
Then let's get him on Lyla and J.J.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.339
Good. I'll have Felicity's back.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.885
Oliver, I know you have a security detail,

10:32.048 --> 10:33.891
but you might as well have a bulls-eye
painted on your head.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.142
I can't disappear again.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.848
I'm still dealing with the
fallout from not being around

10:37.011 --> 10:38.012
when the ACU was attacked.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.183
And there is actually a re-zoning vote
that needs my attention.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.443
What? Wait. Doesn't a vote
take a backseat to finding Church

10:43.601 --> 10:45.148
before he tells every criminal in the city
who you are?

10:45.311 --> 10:46.904
I have security, I'll be fine.

10:47.063 --> 10:51.034
Have you ever... Has he ever actually
said that and it turned out to be true?

10:51.901 --> 10:52.902
You agree with her?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.781
Well, I know I said I thought it was
a good idea for us to start a new team,

10:55.947 --> 10:57.915
but what do we have?
A Laurel Lance wannabe,

10:58.116 --> 11:01.040
a weird rag-guy, a lunatic and Curtis.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.791
Curtis just wasn't who I pictured.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.047
They have potential.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.459
One of them got themselves captured
and gave up your name.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.593
- And I'd like you to debrief him.
- Debrief him?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.254
Church told Rene
that he's planning something.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.139
Something big enough
to involve five cities.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.096
So Church just gave up his master plan?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.306
He thought Rene was gonna be dead
five minutes later.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.438
Church is trying to consolidate
the drug trade through Star City,

11:20.597 --> 11:24.147
but he was waiting for the Green Arrow
to be gone before he made his move.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.277
Okay. Well, if that's true,

11:26.436 --> 11:28.063
I think I know a way we can turn
this to our advantage.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.230
I'm all ears.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.570
Oliver, I know a guy.
Very specific skill set.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.656
I think he could be here in 24 hours.

11:34.986 --> 11:35.987
Did you get my message?

11:36.154 --> 11:38.156
Yeah. Quentin and I
can take care of ourselves.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.542
Still doesn't hurt to have a shadow.
Is Councilman Kullens in there?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.544
Yes. He is waiting in your office
with Susan Williams.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.624
Thank you very much, fellas.
I didn't agree to an interview.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.043
Yeah, well, she's shadowing him
for some type of profile.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.508
And I already tried to get her kicked out,

11:52.670 --> 11:55.139
but he was adamant
about having her in there.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.345
Any advice?

11:56.633 --> 11:57.930
Don't screw it up.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.398
Councilman Kullens, hi.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.942
Miss Williams,
it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.687
Really? Have you watched any of my pieces?

12:08.895 --> 12:12.115
I have, and I think you're off the mark.
In certain instances.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.274
Is that on the record?

12:13.441 --> 12:15.284
If you wanna get an actual quote,
Miss Williams,

12:15.443 --> 12:17.286
you can go through
all the proper channels.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.994
This meeting is strictly
about the re-zoning ordinance.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.535
Yes. Councilman, as you know,
I ran on a platform of unity,

12:23.701 --> 12:25.669
but it is difficult
for a city to be united

12:25.828 --> 12:28.627
when so much of the zoning within it
remains exclusionary.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.339
We need to open it up.
Allow for more affordable housing,

12:32.502 --> 12:35.676
give the people the chance
to start over and rebuild.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.929
The second the money starts rolling in,
those families get squeezed out.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.347
By crony capitalists.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.557
That's not going to happen here.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.892
Hard to believe,
considering your family's history.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.807
I'm sorry, Councilman. I don't follow.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.817
Well, the type of re-zoning
you're proposing

12:47.976 --> 12:49.853
happened downtown 25 years ago.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.024
But instead of affordable housing,
we got sky-rises.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.407
One of them became
the offices of Queen Consolidated.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.156
Is that true, Mr. Mayor?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.497
I'll consider that a "no comment."

13:04.826 --> 13:08.205
I can tell, you have good intentions.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.873
But politics is the art of the real.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.843
I'm sorry. I'm not changing my vote.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.892
Okay, maybe
you should just put an arrow in him.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.400
<i>That was a bit more than I expected
to get done on my lunch break.</i>

13:30.560 --> 13:32.528
Is this a normal Wednesday
afternoon for you?

13:32.687 --> 13:35.531
Well, I had to make up for last night.
I hate canceling last minute.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.656
I got a feeling I'm gonna be
the one canceling on you for a change.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.079
I got a promotion.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.119
I signed on with the ACU.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.409
Oliver's Anti-Crime Unit?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.753
This isn't gonna be weird, right?

13:49.037 --> 13:51.790
- Hmm?
- Me reporting to your ex-fiancé?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.917
Yeah, what could possibly
be weird about that?

13:54.917 --> 13:56.089
- Felicity?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.300
Does Mayor Queen
know that we're seeing each other?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.256
It really doesn't help if you call him
"Mayor Queen."

14:00.423 --> 14:01.424
Felicity...

14:01.758 --> 14:04.102
Definitely. Yeah, he's definitely...

14:04.969 --> 14:06.391
Definitely aware of you.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.607
Love what you've
done with the place.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.520
It's not much, man, but it's home.

14:14.479 --> 14:18.200
And it's safe, especially
now that Felicity's teched up the place.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.525
Thanks for coming out.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.239
No problem, man.
Let's just get this over with.

14:21.778 --> 14:22.779
But I gotta tell you.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.414
There's nothing you could tell me
that I haven't already told myself.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.499
I'm torn apart over this.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.160
Is that what you think this is? A lecture?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.288
What I deserve is a beat-down.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.796
When's the last time
you looked in the mirror?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.963
But maybe something good
can come out of this, man.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.297
Like, I don't know,
maybe you saw something,

14:40.797 --> 14:42.891
heard something
that can help us bring down Church.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.389
I already told Oliver
everything I remember, man.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.598
I know,

14:46.761 --> 14:49.230
but traumatic events have a way
of doing funny things to the memory.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.397
And if you think what you went through
was not traumatic, again I say, mirror.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.981
My dad taught me how to take a beating.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.647
I know, Rene. You're tough.
I get that, man.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.279
But this isn't about being tough, okay?
It's about...

15:03.069 --> 15:05.618
Look, man, I've been where you are, okay?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.703
And I know it's not easy,
but if we talk about this

15:07.907 --> 15:09.284
and go through it step by step...

15:09.492 --> 15:11.085
Look, I said I don't know.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.248
I should be out there trying to fix this.
Not in here with you, playing therapist.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.342
- Oliver says stay put.
- And I'm staying put.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.922
But I don't remember anything.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.686
<i>CHURCH". Yeah, yeah, sure.</i>

15:28.845 --> 15:31.644
Just make sure the AmerTek gear
gets to the Brace.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.184
I want everybody locked and loaded.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.193
No, he's not gonna be a problem.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.696
The Green Arrow'll be dead by then.

15:40.231 --> 15:43.656
Louis, I'm gonna need to hit you back.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.041
You like this place?
I'm getting a penthouse built.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.997
Gonna let me see the whole city.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.504
I told you to stay away
from the Green Arrow.

15:54.662 --> 15:58.257
I don't work for you.
And the Green Arrow found me.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.210
You kidnapped his protégé.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.050
A serendipitous encounter.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.555
And your last.

16:07.300 --> 16:11.396
After getting threatened by a freak,
I hired one of my own.

16:11.554 --> 16:15.775
This was your second warning.
There won't be a third.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.197
I thought you hired me
to kill the Green Arrow.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.655
Nope. You're gonna kill the Mayor.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.418
What is Susan Williams
doing in your office?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.872
I agreed to an off-camera interview.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.839
Okay, come here.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.597
Okay. So, did you go out last night
as the Green Arrow and get hit

16:45.755 --> 16:47.052
really hard, in the head?

16:47.215 --> 16:48.683
Susan Williams is in our lives.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.560
Thea, if we don't make her an ally,
then she's gonna remain an enemy.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.141
Okay, but she's poison.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.807
Well, it turns out that if you ingest
small amounts of poison over time,

16:55.973 --> 16:57.520
you can develop an immunity.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.942
Good morning.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.397
When I got your call last night

17:03.564 --> 17:05.237
I thought someone in my office
was playing a prank on me.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.321
Well, I thought
Thea made a good point yesterday

17:07.484 --> 17:09.532
when she suggested
that you go through the proper channels.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.367
- Hmm.
- Please.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.169
The interview I had in mind
was going to be on camera.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.003
Baby steps. May I ask you a question?

17:19.288 --> 17:22.007
I don't think you understand
how this interview thing works.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.470
Have your attacks
on my administration been

17:25.627 --> 17:28.256
personal or are they just good ratings?

17:28.506 --> 17:31.225
Don't see why they can't be both.
Why are you asking?

17:31.425 --> 17:35.100
Because I'm trying to figure out how hard
I'm gonna have to work to win you over.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.233
You seem like a nice guy.
But you're not a real politician.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.865
I am underqualified.

17:46.023 --> 17:50.654
Vastly. And the city,
my home, is suffering because of it.

17:51.028 --> 17:55.659
I appreciate
the fact that I haven't earned your trust.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.502
Yet. But, Susan,

17:58.661 --> 18:01.255
as someone who professes
to care about Star City,

18:01.414 --> 18:03.917
I think that you owe
it to the people of Star City

18:04.083 --> 18:05.756
to give me an opportunity
to earn that trust.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.420
And I promise you

18:07.587 --> 18:10.511
I can't do that
if I'm spending all of my energy

18:10.673 --> 18:13.017
dodging all of these grenades
that you're lobbing at me.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.762
So, here's my idea.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.852
You give me one month with no attacks.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.110
Let me show you what I can do.
And if I don't deliver,

18:24.186 --> 18:25.438
it's open season.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.576
One month.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.668
- What's this?
- My personal cell.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.044
Why would I need that?

18:41.912 --> 18:43.038
I think you can figure it out.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.513
To survivors of <i>Amazo.</i>

18:50.671 --> 18:52.423
May we experience as much sorrow

18:52.590 --> 18:55.434
as drops of wine
about to be left in glass. <i>Prochnost.</i>

18:55.801 --> 18:56.802
<i>Prochnost.</i>

18:59.513 --> 19:02.232
I get us more drinks.
Something stronger.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.768
All right.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.990
It's a party, Viktor.
Let me get you a drink.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.743
You may have passed all the tests
and said all the right things,

19:15.905 --> 19:19.409
but I do not believe for a second
you are Bratva.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.874
Then you weren't paying attention
during the ceremony, I guess.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.966
Look around you. These men are here
because government men like Kovar

19:27.124 --> 19:28.922
have taken everything from them.

19:29.085 --> 19:34.433
The Bratva is means to bring justice
for all those crimes.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.260
Justice is why I'm here.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.853
Yeah, some American castaway
will never understand.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.110
So you can say all the words
that Anatoly feeds you.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.236
But you'll never be one of us.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.654
And you should know by now
what we do to outsiders.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.531
Viktor, come to toast our new brother?

19:55.361 --> 19:56.863
Yes. Of course.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.449
Congratulations, brother.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.795
What was that about?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.543
That was nothing.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.052
- What is this?
- Best not ask, just drink.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.132
How long are you gonna be staying here,
man?

20:19.969 --> 20:22.939
I'm a fugitive, Rene. I live here.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.977
And until you heal up, we're roomies.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.737
So, you feel much more like talking?

20:31.147 --> 20:33.241
Why don't we talk about the time
you were tortured?

20:37.945 --> 20:38.946
Sure.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.828
It was about a year ago.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.537
My brother, Andy, did it.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.589
- You got tortured by your brother?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.167
He was working with Damien Darhk.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.462
Oliver said you re-enlisted. That why?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.343
Partly.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.682
That also why you sidelined yourself?

20:58.924 --> 20:59.925
That too.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.679
- Hmm.
- So, you ex-Navy, right?

21:03.012 --> 21:05.014
- Dishonorably discharged.
- Reason?

21:05.723 --> 21:07.976
You know something, man,
you don't have to tell me.

21:11.896 --> 21:16.527
We were transporting a prisoner,
one who had information we needed.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.497
Intelligence officers
couldn't get it out of him, so...

21:24.533 --> 21:25.785
I tried to do it my way.

21:25.951 --> 21:26.952
You put a beating on him.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.792
I've been thinking a lot
about that decision.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.582
Particularly since you've been on
the other side of that beat-down, right?

21:31.749 --> 21:34.047
Because I screwed up. Again.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.213
That's my life, man.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.929
And now you're asking me
to relive my latest and greatest.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.843
That's right, Rene.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.771
If you wanna help us.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.274
If you wanna give us anything
that can bring down Church,

21:48.432 --> 21:49.900
I'm afraid you're gonna have to.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.327
Okay.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.576
What do I do?

22:04.114 --> 22:06.492
Councilman. Thank you for coming back.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.253
I'm afraid
you're just wasting both of our times.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.127
After you educated
us on Queen Consolidated,

22:12.289 --> 22:14.166
Thea and I thought
we would do some of our own research.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.429
Yeah, we were very curious to find out
where our family's business was located.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.924
You would not believe
how surprised and delighted

22:22.091 --> 22:24.093
we were to find out that
you were one of those, um...

22:24.260 --> 22:26.308
What was...
What was the term the Councilman used?

22:26.470 --> 22:27.972
"Crony capitalists"?

22:28.138 --> 22:31.108
Right. That you were
one of those crony capitalists

22:31.267 --> 22:33.395
who pushed poor people
out of those neighborhoods.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.612
Hiding behind a shell company, of course.

22:35.771 --> 22:39.196
The same company who owns controlling
interest in a real estate developer.

22:39.358 --> 22:44.455
Who just filed for permits to redevelop
Orchid Bay for commercial uses.

22:44.947 --> 22:49.043
Your opposition to this re-zoning,
it's not political, it's personal.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.748
I get it.
You're trying to protect an investment.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.955
Susan Williams
isn't shadowing you at the moment.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.217
But, to me,
this feels like a story she would like.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.590
So, should I call her?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.797
She actually gave me her number
this morning.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.725
Are you blackmailing me, Mr. Mayor?

23:05.259 --> 23:09.810
Well, Councilman, it's like you said.
"Politics is the art of the real."

23:16.979 --> 23:20.449
Well, that was fun.
You made Kullens squirm.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.327
The guy's a career politician. Just need
to know where to apply the pressure.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.787
How are you so sure
about all this?

23:26.238 --> 23:29.788
I'm the mayor of Star City, Thea.
This is what I do.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.789
Thea, get in the car!
Get in the car, get in the car!

24:05.152 --> 24:10.158
It's my sad duty to inform you
that at 1:23 a.m.,

24:11.659 --> 24:17.541
Mayor Oliver Queen
was pronounced dead at Starling General.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.463
<i>In his too-short life,
Oliver Queen experienced great hardship.</i>

24:24.880 --> 24:27.303
<i>But he came through the other side
with a passion for service,</i>

24:27.466 --> 24:32.848
<i>committed to making Star City
a safer place for us all to call home.</i>

24:33.806 --> 24:37.231
Well, he really didn't say anything
that nice about you when you were alive.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.104
Probably didn't deserve it.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.565
Sorry about the suit.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.538
We haven't been properly introduced.

24:50.739 --> 24:51.740
Heads up.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.041
God!

24:53.617 --> 24:54.618
Christopher Chance.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.625
John referred to you as the
"Human Target."

24:56.787 --> 24:59.916
Well, that works better as a job
description than it does as a nickname.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.714
This is so weird.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.924
You have failed this city.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.509
How's Thea?

25:10.676 --> 25:12.804
She's a little shaken. You know,
I didn't get a chance to tell her

25:12.970 --> 25:15.348
what was gonna go down until right before.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.641
She is gonna be so pissed at you.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.147
And, like, the whole city.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.313
They're gonna find out though, right?
I mean, you can't stay dead forever.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.823
No. Just until Church makes his big move.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.108
<i>That's what you're
betting on now,</i>

25:26.275 --> 25:28.824
that the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen is dead.

25:28.986 --> 25:33.116
That's the hope. Now we just need
to figure out what he has planned.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.126
I do not understand you, Oliver.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.037
You become brother,

25:38.203 --> 25:42.583
but you still act like you carry
weight of world on shoulders alone.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.962
That is what your brothers are for.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.135
I'm just thinking about why I came here.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.677
Because this best bar in town.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.062
Actually, only bar.

25:56.889 --> 26:02.487
No. No, I mean why I came here.
After Lian Yu.

26:03.187 --> 26:06.987
Yes. Yes, you already told me.
Something about old promise.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.152
I thought I told you,
time to move forward.

26:10.319 --> 26:13.619
She has a family. I haven't...

26:14.323 --> 26:15.916
I haven't spoken to them.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.793
Oh, this is about woman?

26:19.995 --> 26:21.713
Now I understand.

26:25.125 --> 26:28.129
There is old saying in Russian.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.048
Okay, maybe not Russian,
but it still works.

26:31.215 --> 26:34.185
"No problem beautiful woman cannot fix."

26:35.511 --> 26:37.263
Now go talk to her before I do.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.118
Oliver! Where are you going?
Party just start.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.403
Figure I'd get some air.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.870
You sure? I think I heard
Anatoly was looking for you.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.330
I'm sure. I'll be fine.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.627
So, thanks for doing this.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.297
Being killed is basically my job.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.053
But, uh, not just for taking the bullets.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.719
I heard that you got Kullens to cave.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.230
Yeah. And scored you
a very pretty girl's phone number.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.437
I heard that too.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.565
Yeah, but the truth is, you did that.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.280
I was under the impression
that I've been down here all day.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.991
I don't just put on faces, Oliver.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.406
I become my target.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.496
And to do that, I've got to learn
everything there is to know about them.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.078
More than they know about themselves.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.502
- I've got to become them.
- My apologies.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.414
What for? Man, you've got a great life.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.754
You're the mayor.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.132
But you'd still rather
be The Hood than Oliver Queen.

27:51.295 --> 27:55.095
Oliver Queen has...
Has never really been my better half.

27:55.257 --> 27:58.386
See, nobody moves forward in life
when they're hiding behind a mask.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.095
Trust me.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.439
You know,
it's why you're struggling as mayor.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.942
And it's probably
why you won't call that girl.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.564
That's not the reason.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.988
Listen, I'm the last person
to give dating advice,

28:10.147 --> 28:13.242
but Felicity moved on. You should too.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.283
You didn't know? Sorry.

28:18.488 --> 28:22.618
Uh, earlier today, I met with a detective
who just joined the ACU.

28:22.784 --> 28:27.381
Uh, Billy Malone. He casually mentioned
that he was seeing Felicity.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.333
Seemed to think that you knew.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.500
Hmm.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.633
<i>You're safe, Rene.
Nothing can hurt you.</i>

28:37.799 --> 28:40.473
Is this gonna be one of those hippy-dippy
meditation things?

28:40.636 --> 28:44.982
Eyes closed. Breathe.
Don't try to remember.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.611
Just go there. Get a picture.

28:53.357 --> 28:57.203
I was starving. My wrists hurt
like hell from the zip ties.

28:57.903 --> 29:01.533
What else? Sounds? Smells?

29:01.698 --> 29:04.076
Couldn't smell anything. Nose was busted.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.961
<i>What about people? Who else was there?</i>

29:06.245 --> 29:09.749
<i>Muscle. Los Halcones. Triad...</i>

29:12.584 --> 29:16.930
<i>It's not the pain
that breaks people. It's fear.</i>

29:17.089 --> 29:19.308
- But there was something else.
- What?

29:20.509 --> 29:23.763
The Trust goes to the Brace, 04 in 72.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.521
I know what's happening.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.407
- Hey!
- Hi.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.329
Um, thanks for letting me swing by.
I know it's late.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.660
You do remember that this apartment
has a front door, right?

29:43.156 --> 29:46.285
Uh, front doors are more for people
who haven't just faked their own death.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.372
Good point. So, what's up?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.508
Your message sounded cryptic.

29:53.667 --> 29:57.262
Sorry. I wasn't sure
if I should say anything at all, actually.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.551
That couldn't wait till tomorrow?

29:58.755 --> 30:01.258
Why didn't you tell me
that you were seeing someone?

30:01.508 --> 30:04.853
Well, maybe on some
crazy sub-conscious level

30:05.012 --> 30:07.515
I was worried you'd show up on my balcony
in the middle of the night.

30:07.681 --> 30:10.560
Sorry.
Snark probably isn't appropriate here.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.857
I'm totally fine
that you're seeing someone.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.905
But I'm hurt that you didn't tell me.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.156
I'm sorry. I meant to, and then
every time I went to go bring it up,

30:20.402 --> 30:24.748
I just sort of...
Like... I just chickened out.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.246
Why? Were you...

30:28.493 --> 30:30.336
Were you
keeping the door open for us, or...

30:30.495 --> 30:32.668
No! Course not.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.254
No, it's just,
you and I work together and I just...

30:35.417 --> 30:41.049
I didn't wanna make it a thing, you know,
until it was something real.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.594
Is it real?

30:47.054 --> 30:48.226
I don't know.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.862
It's John and Rene. They have something.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.488
"The Trust goes to the Brace, 04 in 72."

31:00.650 --> 31:01.651
Could that be any more obscure?

31:01.818 --> 31:04.162
"04 in 72," could be the time and date.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.289
4:00 a.m., 72 hours after he held Rene.

31:06.448 --> 31:07.791
Yeah. That's soon.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.951
And "the Brace"
is what the guys in my hood

31:10.118 --> 31:12.496
used to call a private airstrip
outside Pennytown.

31:12.829 --> 31:13.876
Halpin-Brace Airfield?

31:14.039 --> 31:16.633
That's the one. And this "Trust"?

31:16.792 --> 31:19.591
I think it's the heads of the
crime families that Church controls.

31:19.753 --> 31:22.006
That's a bigger leap than
Curtis took at the Beijing Olympics.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.807
When he had me dig my own grave

31:23.965 --> 31:26.388
he talked about bringing this
"Trust" together.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.554
That's his big play, man.

31:29.513 --> 31:31.231
- 04:00 a.m.'s in 20 minutes.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.023
Wake up the team. We don't have much time.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.113
You're all geared up.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.738
Oliver didn't bust me out of prison
for me to warm the bench, right?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.076
So, what's up? You ready to move out?

31:47.572 --> 31:49.165
Decided not to go.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.998
Last thing any of you need right now
is me screwing things up again.

31:52.285 --> 31:55.414
When it comes to guilt and recrimination,
the line forms behind me.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.417
I didn't think I was ready to face
what I had done.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.803
But I'm wearing this suit again because
I think it's a path to redemption.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.513
And it could be for you, too.

32:19.563 --> 32:20.564
Good flight?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.150
Everyone's very interested in hearing
what you've got planned, Tobias.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.069
It's called the largest drug enterprise
on the Western Coast.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.204
Shipments 24/7.

32:28.363 --> 32:32.539
In a city where cops are afraid
or on our payroll.

32:32.701 --> 32:37.047
And as an added bonus,
the Mayor's an alkie.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.751
Sentry reports movement on the perimeter.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.381
I thought you'd taken out the Green Arrow.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.718
Nah, it's not him. It's the JV squad.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.722
Chill out, damn it! Deal with them.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.313
Spartan is such a badass.

32:57.517 --> 32:58.609
The baddest.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.171
You were right.
Fear of pain is what's worst.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.127
You afraid yet, bitch?

33:19.956 --> 33:21.128
Never.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.444
I lost Church.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.783
Got him. Moving southwest.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.038
I've got these two. Go back up Mr. Church.

34:04.251 --> 34:05.594
You guys all right?

34:07.462 --> 34:08.463
Good to see you again, brother.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.803
Yeah, you too. Nice helmet.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.598
Target is secure. You guys all right?

34:22.018 --> 34:23.860
You look like you've seen a ghost.

34:26.273 --> 34:30.824
You survived. I guess
I'll just have to kill you again, Oliver.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.659
You mind if I call you Oliver?

34:32.946 --> 34:34.118
Yes, I do.

34:40.829 --> 34:41.830
Get up.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.203
You're done, Church.

35:13.403 --> 35:17.374
You got much worse coming,
and you don't even know it.

35:17.741 --> 35:21.917
He calls himself Prometheus,
and he's gonna end you.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.554
First of all, I would like to apologize

35:34.716 --> 35:36.718
for perpetrating
a deception on this scale.

35:37.260 --> 35:40.230
The ACU had intel that we may
be able to catch Mr. Church,

35:40.388 --> 35:43.187
but only if his plan moved forward.

35:43.558 --> 35:47.563
Which would only happen if he believed
the Mayor of Star City was dead.

35:48.605 --> 35:51.825
In my mind, this was a worthwhile gamble.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.783
And it paid off. Mr. Church
and his underlings were apprehended

35:55.945 --> 35:58.368
as well as the heads
of organized crime enterprises

35:58.531 --> 36:02.752
in Blüdhaven, Hub City,
Keystone and White Holland.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.298
One more piece of good news.

36:07.457 --> 36:08.754
I've just received word

36:08.917 --> 36:12.512
that the City Council passed an ordinance
re-zoning for low-income housing.

36:16.466 --> 36:19.140
And with Church in custody,
I take it that your identity is safe?

36:19.427 --> 36:21.896
Well, I hope so. Thanks for the assist.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.474
And the personal insight.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.643
Just part of the service.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.771
Ah, speak of the devil.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.815
Oh, am I the devil now?

36:32.107 --> 36:35.702
That would definitely be my cue to leave.
Take care.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.241
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.876
It's not like you need an invitation.

36:43.493 --> 36:45.746
Yeah, no, I know. I just...

36:45.912 --> 36:48.256
Just between us,
things have been a bit complicated.

36:48.456 --> 36:49.628
Wait, complicated is probably not
the right word.

36:49.791 --> 36:50.792
It's not the wrong word.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.757
I want you to be happy.

36:54.087 --> 36:58.183
And in the spirit of that,
I think that you owe it to yourself

36:58.341 --> 37:02.562
to find out if what you have
with Billy is real.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.015
And I owe it to myself

37:06.182 --> 37:09.152
to embrace whatever's next
for me when I'm not...

37:09.477 --> 37:10.820
- Yes.
- The...

37:12.355 --> 37:13.356
Yeah.

37:14.274 --> 37:17.153
It's funny,
that's what I came here to say to you.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.161
We're usually on the same page.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.414
About a lot of things.

37:24.075 --> 37:29.002
All right. Uh, mmm, yes,
I will see you later.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.206
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

37:34.127 --> 37:36.300
- Thank you.
- You don't need to thank me.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.555
Yeah.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.883
I care about you.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.720
And I will always care about you.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.682
It's a mortal lock.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.028
Viktor wanted to give you a proper gift.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.452
Guessing that's not you.

38:07.327 --> 38:11.878
That's a nice knife.
Maybe I keep it after I kill you.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.462
This doesn't concern you.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.717
Actually it does.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.854
Have a nice night?

38:27.138 --> 38:30.358
You can tell your boss I expect
the other half of my fee within the hour.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.327
Oliver, are you okay?

38:42.111 --> 38:45.991
I'm fine.
Anatoly, what the hell is going on?

38:46.491 --> 38:48.243
Viktor clearly sent those two to kill me.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.707
Then some other guy shows up
and kills them. And...

38:50.870 --> 38:53.293
Yes, yes. My way
of handling Viktor problem.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.924
I know he wanted you dead.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.210
You didn't think
it would be a good idea to tell me that?

38:57.377 --> 38:59.926
We cannot kill Viktor. He's too connected.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.556
I hire special man.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.177
- Come on.
- Anatoly, what did I get myself into?

39:05.510 --> 39:07.729
Yeah, a most interesting question,
my friend.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.362
I thought we agreed
the last time was the last time, Susan.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.775
I know. But then I remembered
my money was still good,

39:19.941 --> 39:22.410
and you still like
gambling a bit too much.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.113
What do you have for me, Ian?

39:24.487 --> 39:27.787
The guy who took the bullets for
Mayor Queen was Christopher Chance.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.291
It felt like his work.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.202
I think I figured out
how Queen knows him.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.416
Really?

39:32.579 --> 39:35.628
I went through the database
looking for details on Chance's past ops.

39:36.916 --> 39:39.339
Came across this little beauty.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.338
You recognize your boy?

39:42.088 --> 39:43.761
That was taken five years ago.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.890
When Oliver Queen was supposedly
stranded on a deserted island.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.646
Heading northbound.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.108
<i>Those cops riding protection
aren't on your payroll, buddy.</i>

40:02.275 --> 40:03.777
Nobody's breaking you out.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.162
It's not what I'm worried about.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.744
You guys should've flown me
to Iron Heights.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.121
Yeah, I heard you liked helicopters.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.287
What's got you spooked?

40:29.260 --> 40:30.512
All right.

41:05.880 --> 41:06.881
Don't go out there.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.553
Why? So I can protect your ass in here?

41:08.716 --> 41:09.933
So you don't get killed.

41:16.683 --> 41:20.813
I knew we'd be having this conversation.
Just hear me out.

41:22.271 --> 41:27.072
You want the Green Arrow.
I can give him to you.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.328
I can give you his name.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.832
You would be the only person who knows.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.416
It's Oliver Queen.

41:40.248 --> 41:41.841
So, we cool?

41:46.170 --> 41:48.548
Yeah, we are.
