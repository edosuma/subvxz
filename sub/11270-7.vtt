00:08.800 --> 00:12.715
Diane. Do me a favour.
Pour Mischa there a real quick beer.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.137
Coming right up, Mischa.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.224
There you go.

00:28.697 --> 00:31.449
Sam, what is he doing with his hand?

00:32.451 --> 00:36.284
He plays cymbals for the Symphony.
They're in the middle of a concert.

00:36.414 --> 00:40.993
He's counting out a long rest
so he knows exactly when to get back.

00:44.340 --> 00:48.552
Fascinating. OK, that's 1 .25
out of a 20. 1 .50, 1 .75,

00:48.678 --> 00:52.012
two, three, four, five, ten and 20.

00:56.853 --> 00:59.938
Musicians are very temperamental.

02:17.985 --> 02:20.477
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:20.613 --> 02:21.609
Norman.

02:21.740 --> 02:25.239
- How's life, Norm?
- Not for the squeamish, Coach.

02:26.328 --> 02:29.532
You're shaking
like a meringue in an earthquake.

02:30.499 --> 02:32.457
My whole career as an accountant,

02:32.585 --> 02:34.792
l sat in my cubicle,
kept my mouth shut.

02:34.921 --> 02:38.622
- Today l volunteered for something.
- What?

02:38.759 --> 02:41.760
Every year,
the firm has a company party.

02:41.887 --> 02:44.176
- Yeah?
- Guess who's party director.

02:44.306 --> 02:46.714
Let me guess. l'm good at guessing.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.345
Julius LaRosa?

02:50.522 --> 02:53.191
Warm, Coach. Me.

02:53.316 --> 02:55.890
Gee, l should've taken more time.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.685
Probably.

02:58.864 --> 03:02.697
- How come you volunteered?
- To make points with the big boss.

03:02.827 --> 03:07.489
Last year, some nobody named Jensen
threw a luau in the parking lot.

03:07.624 --> 03:11.040
lt was a big hit.
You know where that man is today?

03:11.170 --> 03:14.254
Leaning over my shoulder
saying, ''Add faster.''

03:15.550 --> 03:20.426
What are you so upset about?
lt sounds like a great opportunity.

03:20.972 --> 03:22.348
That's what l thought.

03:22.474 --> 03:25.843
But after l volunteered,
l realised l never threw a party.

03:25.978 --> 03:27.852
l killed a few.

03:31.192 --> 03:33.814
What's the big deal?
You want excitement,

03:33.945 --> 03:36.187
pay a sexy chick
to jump out of a cake.

03:36.323 --> 03:38.861
lf you want to save money,
get Carla to do it.

03:40.411 --> 03:42.119
Carla.

03:42.246 --> 03:44.120
Strippers aren't enough here.

03:44.248 --> 03:46.822
Will you relax? Life's too short.

03:46.959 --> 03:50.958
You don't understand.
We're talking about 1 00 accountants.

03:51.089 --> 03:53.877
Their lives are incredibly dull
all week long.

03:54.009 --> 03:57.378
l gotta do something special
to turn them on, wake 'em up.

03:57.513 --> 04:00.763
The best party l was ever at
was in a locker room.

04:00.892 --> 04:04.641
We were all in our underwear,
pouring champagne on each other.

04:04.771 --> 04:08.603
Guys flinging guys into showers.
lt was terrific.

04:08.734 --> 04:11.818
That was after
we'd won the division championship.

04:11.946 --> 04:15.730
- That's why we were in Cleveland.
- Right.

04:18.119 --> 04:23.078
Norm, l've got a great idea.
Have yourself a hot-tub party.

04:23.208 --> 04:26.542
- What?
- The latest craze in California.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.710
You know, Weirdo Central.

04:29.549 --> 04:33.084
Get a bunch of people in a hot tub,
who knows what'll happen?

04:33.219 --> 04:36.968
Today l delivered two copies
of <i>Star Parade</i> magazine.

04:37.099 --> 04:40.385
- Guess who's on the cover in a tub?
- Julius LaRosa?

04:41.437 --> 04:43.180
No, Burt Reynolds.

04:43.314 --> 04:45.936
l used to be so good at this game.

04:46.067 --> 04:50.694
l did think of one icebreaker.
l go through this year's audits,

04:50.822 --> 04:55.401
find the biggest mistakes,
Xerox them and pass them around.

04:55.536 --> 04:57.576
We're talking monster laughs.

04:59.457 --> 05:01.948
You're a maniac, Normie.

05:02.085 --> 05:06.878
Perhaps l can give you an idea
that you could actually use.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.379
l think parties are the most fun

05:09.510 --> 05:14.386
when you can shed your everyday
mundane identity and be someone else.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.389
ln college, l held a party

05:16.517 --> 05:20.017
where everyone came as
their favourite Elizabethan poet.

05:20.147 --> 05:21.890
l remember.

05:22.983 --> 05:26.020
lt was so great,
l chose Christopher Marlowe.

05:26.153 --> 05:28.858
l was deeply into <i>Dr Faustus</i>
at the time.

05:28.990 --> 05:33.533
But l still get letters
from people who loved it.

05:33.662 --> 05:37.956
Say, didn't we used to have
a weekly Elizabethan Poet Night?

05:38.083 --> 05:40.456
Yeah, started getting too rowdy.

05:41.670 --> 05:46.499
You were charged with practising
iambic pentameter without a licence.

05:48.219 --> 05:51.304
Sam, if l'm to serve
both as a waitress

05:51.431 --> 05:54.635
and the butt of jokes,
l should make more money.

05:54.768 --> 05:57.556
What does a good butt make
in this town?

06:01.150 --> 06:06.109
ln keeping with the spirit of
this establishment, and its patrons,

06:06.239 --> 06:10.072
l suggest you get down in the mud
and throw a toga party.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.033
A toga party?
Where they dress up in sheets?

06:14.165 --> 06:17.914
l'm sure you'd love it.
lt's a stupid fraternity tradition.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.129
A bunch of borderline humans
stand around

06:21.256 --> 06:24.376
swilling beer
and vomiting on themselves,

06:24.510 --> 06:27.594
until, inevitably,
they raise their robes

06:27.722 --> 06:30.925
to reveal the depths
of their personalities.

06:31.059 --> 06:33.632
Hallelujah, l am saved!

06:34.730 --> 06:38.099
l can see it. This'll make that luau
look like a pig roast.

06:38.233 --> 06:39.229
Easily.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.314
Can l use Cheers?
l'll pay half what you ask.

06:42.446 --> 06:46.361
- How can l pass that up?
- l got a lot to do here.

06:46.493 --> 06:50.740
l should go home, close myself off
and work out all the details.

06:50.872 --> 06:53.660
- Good luck.
- l can do it in the bathroom.

07:15.191 --> 07:17.314
Sam.

07:18.945 --> 07:22.279
- Are these people dressed in togas?
- No, Coach.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.531
l thought it mean to be
a toga party.

07:24.660 --> 07:26.404
lt is.

07:26.537 --> 07:29.741
l'm getting my spells again.
l though l had 'em licked.

07:29.874 --> 07:32.033
- No, you are right, Coach.
- Sure?

07:32.168 --> 07:36.748
Yes. These people just haven't got
into the spirit of the party.

07:37.174 --> 07:39.131
Oh, thanks.

07:40.219 --> 07:43.719
Diane. The gang in the back
ready for another order?

07:43.848 --> 07:44.927
Not yet.

07:45.058 --> 07:48.676
lt's been an hour and a half.
Are they watching their ice melt?

07:48.812 --> 07:50.604
Actually, it's quite peppy.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.439
One fellow, believe or not,

07:52.566 --> 07:55.271
can recite every area code
in the country.

07:55.403 --> 07:58.320
We're talking dazzling entertainment.

07:59.157 --> 08:02.906
Sam, can you spring me
for a few minutes? l gotta see this.

08:04.204 --> 08:05.829
Enjoy, Coach.

08:05.956 --> 08:08.827
lf this guy knows Laramie, Wyoming,
l'll croak.

08:10.503 --> 08:12.959
Boy, this party stinks.

08:14.507 --> 08:18.719
Well, maybe we should do something
to help pick it up.

08:18.845 --> 08:22.297
l got an idea.
Why don't you go back to my office?

08:22.433 --> 08:25.636
ln my desk you'll find two tassels
and a G-string.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.561
l'll hum <i>Night Train...</i>

08:27.689 --> 08:29.978
- Come on.
- Get out.

08:31.651 --> 08:33.977
Let the games begin!

08:36.030 --> 08:37.442
Holy...

08:46.543 --> 08:50.078
Well, you all got the date right
so l know you can read.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.625
How come you're not in a toga?

08:54.760 --> 08:59.387
l was afraid everyone else would
chicken out and l'd look like a fool.

09:00.517 --> 09:02.142
Good point.

09:02.811 --> 09:05.267
Jensen, nice suit.

09:07.608 --> 09:09.233
Hello, there.

09:12.614 --> 09:15.484
Why did l volunteer? l'm a dead man.

09:17.828 --> 09:21.529
Sammy, you got someone
lying in state in the back room?

09:23.042 --> 09:25.877
Nobody's moved
for an hour and a half.

09:26.587 --> 09:31.131
Normie, l like it. You look like
the Pillsbury Dough Monster.

09:32.844 --> 09:35.514
- How come you're late?
- l had car trouble.

09:35.639 --> 09:38.640
You try flagging down help
dressed like this.

09:42.021 --> 09:44.809
Where's your wife?
Why isn't she at the party?

09:44.941 --> 09:47.183
She didn't hear about it.

09:49.947 --> 09:54.693
This is the worst party yet. Thanks
loads for the toga idea, Diane.

09:55.995 --> 10:00.741
Well, Norman, all you need
is a little icebreaker. Let me help.

10:02.252 --> 10:07.330
Everybody. How about a round of that
always enjoyable game, charades?

10:07.842 --> 10:09.301
l'll start off.

10:11.971 --> 10:13.881
Movie title.

10:14.683 --> 10:15.797
Four words.

10:17.477 --> 10:19.304
First word.

10:23.734 --> 10:27.020
My. Sounds like eye.

10:27.155 --> 10:31.200
l'll give you the first one,
get you going. OK, second word.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.570
What am l doing here? Eating.

10:35.706 --> 10:39.122
Doesn't this look like eating?
When do we eat and drink?

10:39.252 --> 10:41.375
Dinner! <i>My Dinner...</i>

10:41.504 --> 10:43.497
Third word.

10:45.300 --> 10:49.630
What is this? lt's little, isn't it?
lt's a little word.

10:49.763 --> 10:53.892
W. Begins with a W. Little word.
With! <i>My Dinner With...</i>

10:54.018 --> 10:56.854
<i>My Dinner With Julius LaRosa!</i>

10:59.399 --> 11:01.439
That's it.

11:01.902 --> 11:05.236
- OK, Ogden, Utah.
- Eight zero one!

11:07.533 --> 11:10.203
Hold it down, everybody,
it's the phone!

11:11.496 --> 11:13.952
l feel it! l feel that beat!

11:14.082 --> 11:18.330
Get up off your seat
and on your feet. lt's limbo time.

11:23.718 --> 11:26.043
Come on, everybody!

11:27.347 --> 11:29.304
Come on now.

11:31.143 --> 11:34.808
Last year, you ate a pig
with your fists. What's going on?

11:35.773 --> 11:37.517
Come on!

11:39.652 --> 11:41.444
Pack of nerds.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.945
Norm, that was a message for you.

11:46.076 --> 11:48.994
Somebody named Ruta
can't make it tonight.

11:49.121 --> 11:52.621
Ruta's the girl l had coming
to entertain the big boss.

11:54.669 --> 11:56.626
This can't be happening.

11:56.755 --> 11:59.460
First, l throw the worst party
in history,

11:59.591 --> 12:01.714
now l got no date for the big boss.

12:01.844 --> 12:04.335
You've got to set your boss up
with a woman?

12:04.472 --> 12:06.844
Yeah, it's the party director's duty.

12:06.974 --> 12:12.562
Why not ask one of the women here?
Or does your boss like live things?

12:15.734 --> 12:19.020
- Carla, do you suppose...?
- No, Norm. Don't look at me.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.942
l got four kids.
l'm not looking for more.

12:22.074 --> 12:26.737
- You needn't have sex with him.
- Doesn't matter. l'm a fast breeder.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.910
A man winks at me
and l'm three months along.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.661
l need a woman!

12:35.548 --> 12:38.004
Does anybody need anything?

12:39.219 --> 12:41.128
Hallelujah!

12:56.404 --> 12:58.444
Let me see if l've got this straight?

12:58.573 --> 13:03.236
You want me to
entertain a man l've never met.

13:03.370 --> 13:05.862
Pour him a few drinks
and chat with him.

13:05.998 --> 13:08.122
You don't have to go home with him.

13:08.251 --> 13:10.920
Though if you do, l'll drive.

13:11.046 --> 13:12.789
l'm joking around.

13:12.923 --> 13:18.048
l'm going to walk away and pretend
that you never asked me to do this.

13:18.512 --> 13:22.427
This could work out for you, too.
You might like this guy.

13:22.558 --> 13:25.762
He's intelligent.
He went to Harvard Business School.

13:25.895 --> 13:27.639
Sam?

13:27.773 --> 13:31.818
l can't believe your job depends
on you finding this guy a woman.

13:31.944 --> 13:35.278
That's right.
lt's demeaning and dehumanising,

13:35.406 --> 13:37.315
not just to me but to yourself.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.941
l get it.
You think l'm a kissy, right?

13:41.454 --> 13:46.117
lt's easy for you two to talk.
Diane's attractive, she's got brains.

13:46.251 --> 13:49.039
Sammy, good-looking, a baseball star.

13:49.171 --> 13:51.413
l've got nothing. My only hope is

13:51.549 --> 13:54.918
to find someone with something
and make them like me.

13:55.053 --> 13:57.888
- Norm...
- So if there are boots to be licked,

13:58.015 --> 14:02.060
apples to be polished and
fannies to be kissed, l'll be there.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.479
First time l saw a man
strut and grovel at the same time.

14:08.985 --> 14:13.149
You know, Norm is
kind of in a jam here tonight.

14:14.575 --> 14:18.407
- Now you want me to do this.
- lt wouldn't be so bad, would it?

14:18.537 --> 14:22.073
- You're asking me to do this.
- What's the big deal?

14:22.208 --> 14:26.420
You sit down with some old guy,
you have a drink, he'll fall asleep.

14:26.546 --> 14:29.120
Hello, Mr Sawyer, sir. Welcome.

14:33.763 --> 14:36.052
Well, Norman's a friend.

14:37.433 --> 14:41.479
l guess l could give the old geezer
a couple of minutes of my time.

14:42.356 --> 14:45.855
We are all honoured and thrilled
that you could make it.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.986
- l like your sheet.
- This old thing?

14:50.490 --> 14:53.361
Come on down here,
l'll show you a seat.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.411
Why don't you let me do that?
l know the place.

14:56.538 --> 14:59.208
l'll never forget this, Diane.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.456
Mr Sawyer, Diane Chambers.

15:01.585 --> 15:04.421
- Nice to meet you, Diane.
- Nice to meet you.

15:05.506 --> 15:07.962
Why don't you two sit right here?
You!

15:13.932 --> 15:16.305
Well, what would you like to drink?

15:18.437 --> 15:20.644
Scotch rocks.

15:20.773 --> 15:23.810
Barkeep, a little service, please.

15:27.406 --> 15:32.364
Mr Sawyer will have Scotch rocks.
Let's see, what am l in the mood for?

15:32.495 --> 15:34.155
How about a good beating?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.158
- Perhaps a vermouth cassis.
- Fine.

15:39.294 --> 15:43.624
lf you need anything else, just
snap your fingers. ln several places.

15:44.925 --> 15:47.251
l guess working in a bar
makes you grumpy.

15:48.971 --> 15:53.219
Good evening! We're Eddie Barnett
and the Eddie Barnetters.

15:53.351 --> 15:56.139
OK, it's request time. Shout 'em out.

16:04.739 --> 16:06.150
<i>Chicago?</i>

16:06.282 --> 16:09.284
One of Eddie's favourites. <i>Chicago.</i>

16:20.798 --> 16:23.041
Norm, this band is the worst.

16:23.176 --> 16:27.305
l don't understand it.
They sounded so good over the phone.

16:27.431 --> 16:29.507
- So you're an art student?
- Yes.

16:29.642 --> 16:31.516
l always wanted to be a painter.

16:33.730 --> 16:37.562
l must say, it is so refreshing
to meet someone like you.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.777
Someone in business
who enjoys the finer things.

16:40.904 --> 16:43.277
Here you go. One for you.

16:43.407 --> 16:45.566
One for your lady of the evening.

16:52.292 --> 16:55.993
- To a sparkling conversationalist.
- Thank you.

16:58.340 --> 17:02.041
l'd normally ask you to go out
and find some place to talk,

17:02.178 --> 17:06.223
but l don't think we'd find
any place as quiet as this.

17:10.228 --> 17:12.684
- Something wrong with your drink?
- Yes.

17:12.815 --> 17:15.520
- l'll take it back.
- No, l know the bartender.

17:15.651 --> 17:17.893
- You sure?
- Yes, l'll be right back.

17:22.742 --> 17:26.990
- Do you have a problem, Mr Malone?
- Listen, you're a light drinker.

17:27.122 --> 17:30.492
Don't get carried away
and do something you'll regret.

17:32.837 --> 17:36.456
You're not bothered
that l'm spending time with Herb?

17:36.591 --> 17:38.418
Herb?

17:38.552 --> 17:41.672
No. None of my business, really.

17:41.805 --> 17:44.807
Looks a little seamy
but seaminess has its place.

17:46.519 --> 17:48.808
A moment ago
you were encouraging it.

17:48.938 --> 17:51.394
A moment ago, he was 85 years old.

17:53.610 --> 17:56.066
l see. An old man is fine,

17:56.196 --> 17:59.114
but one whose kidneys
are functioning is taboo.

17:59.241 --> 18:02.112
Look, like l said,
it's none of my business,

18:02.245 --> 18:06.907
but he expects you to be his for the
whole evening. Know what l mean?

18:07.042 --> 18:11.870
Sam, we are having
a harmless conversation about art.

18:12.006 --> 18:13.797
- You know what l think?
- What?

18:13.924 --> 18:17.294
l think you're bothered
that he's so good-looking.

18:18.221 --> 18:21.637
You call that good-looking?
He's got padded shoulders

18:21.766 --> 18:24.436
and l bet that's not even
his real lips.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.814
- He's gorgeous. lt drives you crazy.
- No.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.560
lt kills you that there's
another attractive man in your bar.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.068
Another rooster in your henhouse.

18:36.741 --> 18:41.320
My days are much easier now we've got
those Cup-a-Soups in the office.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.373
lf that was your idea, Mr Sawyer,
you are a genius.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.956
Norm, how about l buy you a drink?

18:47.086 --> 18:51.131
Why don't you set sail for the bar
and have yourself a good time?

18:51.258 --> 18:52.800
That's wonderful, sir.

18:52.926 --> 18:56.876
l understand there's a pool table
in the back. How about a game?

18:57.014 --> 19:02.056
OK. l've never played before,
but why should that stop us?

19:02.186 --> 19:05.887
Thank you for that conversation, sir.
l'm the better for it.

19:07.442 --> 19:09.684
- Hi, there.
- Hello.

19:11.405 --> 19:13.445
That is a good-looking guy.

19:14.867 --> 19:17.240
l felt something kick.

19:27.256 --> 19:30.043
Now you know
why l never go to these things.

19:30.176 --> 19:33.261
lt's strange,
getting that reaction from people.

19:33.388 --> 19:36.555
l like to think it's the money
and position, not me.

19:36.683 --> 19:38.842
l can assure you, it's not you.

19:41.021 --> 19:44.770
l think Sawyer likes Diane.
l'm on my way, big guy.

19:44.901 --> 19:47.226
You're really sickening tonight.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.775
l know, Sam. l'm not proud of myself.

19:50.907 --> 19:52.865
But then, l never am.

20:01.044 --> 20:05.172
Well, Simon Says is my game.
l'm great at that.

20:05.298 --> 20:10.091
Maybe l can help you out. l can teach
you to play in a couple of minutes.

20:10.220 --> 20:14.468
Just put your left hand down,
like that.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.930
- Grab the end with your other hand.
- l'm not in the way, am l?

20:19.064 --> 20:23.525
- You smell wonderful. What is it?
- Thank you. Dandruff shampoo.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.736
- l like it.
- l don't flake for hours.

20:29.909 --> 20:32.910
- Herb, wait a minute.
- Diane, you're beautiful.

20:33.038 --> 20:36.703
You know, l don't believe in
mauling on the first date.

20:36.833 --> 20:40.832
- l didn't come to hear the band.
- We were having a nice conversation.

20:40.963 --> 20:44.379
- That part's over.
- How is everything back here?

20:45.468 --> 20:47.794
- Norman!
- He'll stop in a minute.

20:47.929 --> 20:50.136
- No, really.
- Mr Sawyer, sir...

20:50.265 --> 20:52.305
- Get lost, Norm.
- Fine, sir.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.972
- This is not my idea of romance.
- Come on.

20:56.105 --> 20:57.932
- Wait.
- l told you to leave.

20:58.065 --> 20:59.643
Mr Sawyer!

20:59.776 --> 21:02.730
- This is a big mistake.
- Sorry, sir. l know, sir.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.571
Nice cologne, sir.

21:04.698 --> 21:08.363
You're crazy. You set me up
with this girl and then do this?

21:09.870 --> 21:12.622
There's no room in my company
for unstable people.

21:12.748 --> 21:17.126
- Clean out your desk. You're fired!
- l figured.

21:17.754 --> 21:21.088
Norman, l'm real sorry
you lost your job.

21:21.216 --> 21:24.420
- That's what l was trying to avoid.
- lt's alright.

21:24.553 --> 21:27.554
What was that about?
Your boss just stormed out.

21:27.682 --> 21:29.971
- He's not my boss any more.
- What?

21:30.101 --> 21:33.186
He was all over Diane.
l had to get rough with him.

21:33.939 --> 21:35.563
l want a beer.

21:39.069 --> 21:41.109
- You OK?
- Yes.

21:42.406 --> 21:44.233
Well, go ahead. Gloat.

21:45.326 --> 21:49.241
Believe it or not,
l'm really sorry this happened.

21:49.372 --> 21:52.991
l know you must be feeling
hurt and angry right now.

21:53.127 --> 21:54.455
No.

21:54.587 --> 21:58.834
l'm not feeling hurt and angry.
l brought this on myself.

21:59.717 --> 22:02.256
- Actually, l feel kind of...
- Cheap?

22:05.599 --> 22:08.434
Alright, yes, l feel cheap.

22:09.728 --> 22:13.228
l saw an attractive person,
a little glamour,

22:13.358 --> 22:18.020
and l wanted to meet him so badly
that l threw myself at him.

22:19.114 --> 22:22.281
Totally sacrificing
my dignity and pride.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.114
What's wrong with that?
l do that all the time.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.619
For one terrible moment
l saw myself through his eyes.

22:33.588 --> 22:37.503
l saw nothing but a... cheap harlot.

22:38.302 --> 22:41.802
Come on. We all know
that you'd starve to death

22:41.931 --> 22:44.718
before you made a living
with your body.

22:47.437 --> 22:50.355
- Thanks, Sam.
- You're welcome, Diane.

22:54.779 --> 22:57.104
So he fired you, Norm?

22:57.907 --> 22:59.105
Fired me, Coach.

23:00.618 --> 23:02.777
You know something?

23:02.913 --> 23:06.614
l may not have a job.
l may not have a future.

23:07.793 --> 23:11.625
l may not have anything
except this sheet on my back.

23:12.757 --> 23:14.797
But you know something?

23:14.926 --> 23:16.634
l feel terrible.

23:17.721 --> 23:19.464
Gee, l'm sorry, Norm.

23:23.352 --> 23:27.350
- Did you really hit the boss?
- No, l just shoved him around a bit.

23:27.482 --> 23:32.061
Everybody, it's true.
Norman just punched out the boss.

23:32.195 --> 23:35.647
- l just pushed him around.
- Way to go, Peterson.

23:35.783 --> 23:37.906
Alright, Norman!

23:39.286 --> 23:41.445
Norman, our hero!
