00:05.978 --> 00:08.279
Just pile on
the sauerkraut and onions.

00:08.281 --> 00:09.281
Sure thing.

00:09.282 --> 00:11.282
You better load mine up, too.
Okay.

00:11.284 --> 00:13.184
BAEZ: Well, this is
a new record.

00:13.186 --> 00:15.186
What, for how long
we'll have to ride around

00:15.188 --> 00:16.219
with the windows down

00:16.222 --> 00:17.288
after eating these?

00:17.290 --> 00:19.023
No, how long
my New Year's diet lasted.

00:19.025 --> 00:20.091
Oh.

00:20.093 --> 00:22.460
Mine lasted ten minutes
into the Rose Bowl.

00:22.462 --> 00:23.694
There you go.

00:23.696 --> 00:26.697
Thank you.
Come to mama.

00:26.699 --> 00:27.798
(gunshots)

00:27.800 --> 00:29.600
(people screaming)

00:29.602 --> 00:31.535
(gunshots continue)
You see the shooter?

00:31.537 --> 00:33.871
DANNY:
Heavy coat with a mask.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.908
(people screaming)

00:39.579 --> 00:40.579
Help him!

00:40.580 --> 00:41.946
I got the shooter!

00:41.948 --> 00:43.647
(brakes screeching)

00:43.649 --> 00:45.483
Move it!

00:46.586 --> 00:47.952
(panicked shouting)

00:50.389 --> 00:52.089
Get out of the way!
Move!

00:52.091 --> 00:53.157
Move!

00:53.159 --> 00:54.391
(shouting)

00:54.393 --> 00:55.926
Move!
Watch out!

00:55.928 --> 00:57.027
(shrieks)

00:57.029 --> 00:59.063
(gunshots, tires screeching)
Move.

00:59.065 --> 01:00.464
(car alarm whooping)

01:04.670 --> 01:06.437
Stay on the ground.
You okay?

01:06.439 --> 01:08.305
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:08.307 --> 01:09.307
Where'd the shooter go?

01:09.308 --> 01:10.841
Hey, man,
we need help over here!

01:10.843 --> 01:13.410
All right, just step back!

01:21.854 --> 01:24.054
Call 911!

01:25.758 --> 01:28.392
Officer Brent Miller

01:28.394 --> 01:31.162
is promoted to the rank
of Detective Third Grade.

01:32.765 --> 01:34.532
Thank you.

01:35.701 --> 01:37.635
Congratulations,
Detective.

01:37.637 --> 01:38.936
Thank you, sir.

01:40.173 --> 01:43.674
Our final promotion goes to

01:43.676 --> 01:45.576
Sergeant Sidney Gormley.

01:45.578 --> 01:48.612
He is promoted

01:51.784 --> 01:53.851

01:55.254 --> 01:56.854
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

01:58.124 --> 01:59.790

02:06.599 --> 02:09.500

02:30.356 --> 02:32.089
Nice to finally meet you.

02:32.091 --> 02:33.157
Nice to meet you, too.

02:33.159 --> 02:36.026
Look, uh, I gotta
make the rounds.

02:36.028 --> 02:37.361
I'll be right back.
SHEILA: Okay.

02:43.035 --> 02:44.201
Detective Miller.

02:44.203 --> 02:45.203
How's that sound?

02:45.204 --> 02:46.804
Fantastic, sir.

02:46.806 --> 02:48.272
This is my
mother, Phyllis.

02:48.274 --> 02:49.373
Nice to
meet you.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.375
We're lucky to have him.

02:50.376 --> 02:51.942
Well, thank you.

02:51.944 --> 02:54.345
And my father, Don.

02:54.347 --> 02:55.913
Don. Congratulations.

02:55.915 --> 02:57.047
Thank you.
Yeah.

02:57.049 --> 02:59.049
Tell me where we've met.

02:59.051 --> 03:01.352
We haven't.

03:01.354 --> 03:02.720
Oh.

03:02.722 --> 03:05.155
Well, enjoy this day.

03:05.157 --> 03:07.725
Thank you, sir.

03:16.602 --> 03:18.636
Sid, Baker.

03:21.540 --> 03:23.874
Detective Miller's dad.

03:23.876 --> 03:26.744
Have him detained as soon
as he leaves the room.

03:26.746 --> 03:28.412
As discreetly as possible.

03:28.414 --> 03:30.848
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

Don't you think a CGI shark
would look better?

03:41.093 --> 03:43.594
One more word
and you're out of the car.

03:44.397 --> 03:46.263
Stop!
Whoa! Whoa! Crazy lady!

03:46.265 --> 03:47.498
Please, stop!

03:47.500 --> 03:48.732
Officer, please, help!

03:48.734 --> 03:49.550
Officer, they're gonna kill him!

03:49.551 --> 03:51.854
What happened?
A guy hit a girl, but it was an accident.

03:51.854 --> 03:52.525
Where is he?

03:52.549 --> 03:54.430
Okay, right around the corner,
right over there.

03:55.107 --> 03:57.408
Right around
the corner.

03:58.277 --> 03:59.543
Oh, wow.

03:59.545 --> 04:01.111
Oh, geez.
She wasn't kidding.

04:01.113 --> 04:02.212

Here we go.

04:13.159 --> 04:14.159
You set?

04:14.160 --> 04:15.326
Yeah.
All right, keep it tight.

04:15.328 --> 04:16.226
Yeah. Let's go.

04:16.228 --> 04:17.928
Here!
He's over here!

04:17.930 --> 04:18.930
Okay, ma'am,

04:18.930 --> 04:20.697
please back up.
Step to the side.

04:20.700 --> 04:21.798
Relax.

04:21.801 --> 04:23.534
Back up! Back up!

04:23.536 --> 04:24.768
Step aside! Back up!

04:24.770 --> 04:25.970
Back up!
Police!

04:25.972 --> 04:27.271
Step back! Step back!
Get away from the door!

04:27.273 --> 04:29.473
(horn honking)
Tough guy? Huh?!

04:29.475 --> 04:31.308
(indistinct shouting)

04:31.310 --> 04:33.243
Get your hands off him!
Help me!

04:33.245 --> 04:34.878
Help me!
Get off!

04:34.880 --> 04:35.946
(angry shouting)

04:35.948 --> 04:37.481
Get back! Off!

04:37.483 --> 04:38.682
(grunting)

04:38.684 --> 04:40.117
Get off!
Let go!

04:40.119 --> 04:41.051
Hey, you!

04:41.053 --> 04:42.820
Back off!
Back off!

04:42.822 --> 04:44.621
(indistinct shouting)

04:44.623 --> 04:47.491
He almost killed Mia over there!

04:47.493 --> 04:48.926
All right!

04:50.096 --> 04:51.395
(panting, sobbing)

04:51.397 --> 04:52.863
Back off!
It was just an accident!

04:52.865 --> 04:54.498
All right, calm down!
Stop talking.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.599
Stop talking.

04:55.601 --> 04:57.401
All right, calm down!
Calm down!

04:57.403 --> 04:59.703
Son of a bitch tried
to get away,

04:59.705 --> 05:01.672
so he's getting what he
deserves, ain't that right?

05:01.674 --> 05:03.240
(shouting)
Ain't that right?

05:03.242 --> 05:05.142
Huh?
Back up!

05:05.144 --> 05:07.011
We got it. We got it.

05:07.013 --> 05:08.846
Is she okay?

05:08.848 --> 05:10.681
She's doing okay.
Just call a bus.

05:10.683 --> 05:13.417
Central, 12-David,
we need a bus at this location.

Dead guy's name was
Curtis Fallows,

05:54.150 --> 05:56.117
22 years old.

05:56.119 --> 05:58.219
I can't believe
this guy ran three blocks

05:58.221 --> 06:00.021
after being shot in the marbles.

06:00.023 --> 06:02.957
Well, adrenaline's
a hell of a drug.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.460
I'm guessing shooter knocked

06:05.462 --> 06:07.428
on the front door over there,
Curtis opens up,

06:07.430 --> 06:09.063
takes a shot
to the groin,

06:09.065 --> 06:10.298
runs down
the fire escape

06:10.300 --> 06:12.100

06:15.171 --> 06:16.671
I don't know,
but whatever it was,

06:16.673 --> 06:18.940
it wasn't enough.

06:18.942 --> 06:21.275
He's got collection notices
up the wazoo over here.

in 2B says
two nights ago

06:27.150 --> 06:29.517
some guy was banging
on your deceased's door,

06:29.519 --> 06:31.753
yelling he better
“pay back the loan he got,”

06:31.755 --> 06:34.055
'cause if he didn't,
he was “dead meat.”

06:34.057 --> 06:37.492
Have CSU dust the front door
for prints ASAP.

06:37.494 --> 06:38.926
And watch the blood.
Got it.

06:38.928 --> 06:40.194
Guess he didn't
pay back the loan.

06:40.196 --> 06:42.530
Yeah. And now he
is dead meat.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.932
No pun intended.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.469
(indistinct radio transmission)

06:49.305 --> 06:50.805
Oh, whoa, hey.

hold up.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.474
Hey.

07:02.919 --> 07:04.519
See you got the
crowd calmed down.

07:04.521 --> 07:05.820
Yeah.
They're still pissed.

07:05.822 --> 07:07.155
Mia's the third kid
who's been hit

07:07.157 --> 07:08.322
on this street
in two months.

07:08.324 --> 07:09.657
The city hasn't
done anything.

07:09.659 --> 07:10.925
Well, I'm not sure
human sacrifice

07:10.927 --> 07:12.660
is the way to get
speed bumps installed.

07:12.662 --> 07:14.729
WOMAN:
Hey! Excuse me.

07:14.731 --> 07:16.063
You two were
the first on the scene?

07:16.065 --> 07:17.965
Yeah. And just in
time, Detective.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.067
How's the driver?

07:20.069 --> 07:21.469
Rattled, bruised.
(handcuffs clicking)

07:21.471 --> 07:22.703
Claims he didn't even know
he hit someone

07:22.705 --> 07:23.738
until he turned that corner

07:23.740 --> 07:25.139
and saw people
waving behind him.

07:25.141 --> 07:27.408
Circled round the block and came
back to see what happened.

07:27.410 --> 07:30.244
I did not mean
to hurt her.

07:30.246 --> 07:31.813
I tried to be responsible,
but they all attacked me!

07:31.815 --> 07:33.181
Relax,
Mr. Santiago.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.416
You'll get your
day in court.

Look, this is
a crapfest all around.

07:38.521 --> 07:40.621
Highway's en route
to give him a sobriety test,

07:40.623 --> 07:41.989
but I want statements
from everyone

07:41.991 --> 07:44.525
and I want the guy
who was trying to string him up.

07:44.527 --> 07:46.160
I know who the ringleader was.

07:46.162 --> 07:47.628
And I'll interview
witnesses.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.330
All right.
Then let's get to work.

07:55.004 --> 07:56.471
GORMLEY (over speaker):
You admit you've been living

07:56.473 --> 07:58.473
under an alias-- Donald Miller--

07:58.475 --> 08:01.275
when your real name
is Donald DeCarlo.

08:01.277 --> 08:02.743
Yes.

08:02.745 --> 08:04.479
And you knew you were wanted

08:04.481 --> 08:06.214
in connection
with the shooting death

08:06.216 --> 08:09.283
of Police Officer
Steven Dixon back in 1976.

08:09.285 --> 08:11.886
Yes.

08:11.888 --> 08:13.921
Could I get a glass of water,
please?

08:15.291 --> 08:17.358
(knock on door)

08:21.831 --> 08:24.532
That's your guy, Pop.

08:24.534 --> 08:27.368
I can't believe we
finally got him.

08:27.370 --> 08:29.403
Walked right into One PP.

08:29.405 --> 08:31.506
He gave himself up?

08:31.508 --> 08:33.307
Well, not exactly.
I promoted his son

08:33.308 --> 08:36.244
to detective
and he came to the ceremony.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.912
Does Danny know?

08:37.914 --> 08:40.347
Yeah, I got
word to him.

08:40.350 --> 08:41.515
(chuckles)

08:41.518 --> 08:43.150
30-some-odd years,

08:43.152 --> 08:45.419
three generations of us
trying to find him,

08:45.421 --> 08:47.588
and he falls right into our lap.

08:49.692 --> 08:51.692
I never would've
recognized him.

08:51.694 --> 08:53.094
Oh.

08:53.096 --> 08:54.829
Last time I saw him,

08:54.831 --> 08:55.963
he had hair down
to his shoulders.

08:55.965 --> 08:57.331
I had TARU

08:57.333 --> 08:58.833
age-progress his teenage

08:58.835 --> 09:00.568
mugshot every
five years.

09:00.570 --> 09:02.370
Bald, not bald.

09:02.372 --> 09:04.772
Beard, no beard...
all the variables.

09:04.774 --> 09:06.374
I guess I got used to the idea

09:06.376 --> 09:08.409
that the “one who got away”
really did.

09:08.411 --> 09:09.777
(door closes)

09:09.779 --> 09:11.012
GORMLEY:
Here.

09:11.014 --> 09:13.214
Thank you.

09:14.817 --> 09:15.983
Yes, I was the kid

09:15.985 --> 09:18.219
that Officer Dixon
was chasing that day.

09:18.221 --> 09:19.720
But someone else shot him.

09:19.722 --> 09:22.223
Oh, the ever-popular
“someone else.”

09:22.225 --> 09:24.792
If you weren't the shooter,
then who was?

09:24.794 --> 09:26.060
I don't know.

09:26.062 --> 09:27.228
Someone reached out
from behind me and fired.

09:27.230 --> 09:29.196
I never saw who it was.
Yeah?

09:29.198 --> 09:30.531
I have never so much as

09:30.533 --> 09:32.433
even touched a gun
my entire life!

09:32.435 --> 09:34.468
I saw you do it, pal.

09:34.470 --> 09:36.604
GORMLEY: Oh, yeah, so you're telling me
you did time in Spofford

09:36.606 --> 09:39.941
as a juvenile for
robberies and burglaries

09:39.943 --> 09:42.710
and then went out on the lam
for almost 40 years

09:42.712 --> 09:44.545
for a crime you didn't commit?

09:44.547 --> 09:48.516
Because I knew that
no one would believe me.

09:48.518 --> 09:51.285
But from that day,
I have turned myself around.

09:51.287 --> 09:54.322
I got married, had Brent.

09:54.324 --> 09:57.191
I mean, if I were a cop-killer,

09:57.193 --> 09:59.427
would I have encouraged him
to become a cop?

10:01.731 --> 10:03.030
That's why

10:03.032 --> 10:06.934
I had to come see my
boy get his promotion.

10:15.011 --> 10:18.179
Come on, Officer, we weren't
really trying to hurt that guy.

10:18.181 --> 10:20.147
Yeah, you were just pulling
his ass out of that car

10:20.149 --> 10:21.349
to see if
he was okay, right?

10:21.351 --> 10:22.717
He almost
killed Mary.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.385
She's like a kid
sister to me.

10:24.387 --> 10:26.687
Mia.
Her name's Mia.

10:26.689 --> 10:28.089
That-That's what
I meant, Mia.

10:28.091 --> 10:29.123
You don't even know her.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.124
You just wanted
to beat someone up.

10:30.126 --> 10:31.325
You know what?
Here's your chance.

10:31.327 --> 10:32.526
Go on. Have fun.

10:32.528 --> 10:33.694
I'll get my cuffs
back later.

10:33.696 --> 10:36.764
So, that's our
ringleader?

10:36.766 --> 10:39.433
Yeah, not so tough
now, is he?

10:39.435 --> 10:41.135
How'd that
Breathalyzer go?

10:41.137 --> 10:43.371
Mr. Santiago blew a .12.

10:43.373 --> 10:44.905
Which means we got him
for leaving the scene,

10:44.907 --> 10:46.941
reckless endangerment
and DWI.

10:46.943 --> 10:48.209
Sounds like
a good day.

10:48.211 --> 10:49.810
Thanks to you and
your partner.

10:49.812 --> 10:50.778
Hey.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.146
Detective?

10:53.149 --> 10:55.049
We got a problem.

10:55.985 --> 10:57.952
That woman...

10:57.954 --> 10:59.887
says there were
two people in the car.

10:59.889 --> 11:01.555
Come again?

11:01.557 --> 11:02.990
Yeah, she says
the guy you collared

11:02.992 --> 11:04.191
wasn't even
the one driving.

11:04.193 --> 11:06.327
So, who was?

11:06.329 --> 11:07.628
She couldn't see,

11:07.630 --> 11:10.998
but she swears Mr. Santiago
was in the passenger seat,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.667
and when the car came
back around the block,

11:12.669 --> 11:14.669
he was behind the wheel
and alone.

11:14.671 --> 11:16.837
Maybe she's confused.

11:19.676 --> 11:21.308
She seems sharp
as a tack.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.411
How long you
been on the job?

11:23.413 --> 11:25.112
A little over a year.

11:25.114 --> 11:28.015
So you're barely off probation
and already playing detective?

11:28.017 --> 11:29.550
I have
a credible witness.

11:29.552 --> 11:31.385
I have the guy
who hit the girl

11:31.387 --> 11:33.354
in the box right now
writing out his confession

11:33.356 --> 11:35.723
and still a little
intox while doing it.

11:35.725 --> 11:36.824
Detective...

11:36.826 --> 11:38.526
Thanks for your help, guys.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.030
(scoffs)
You believe me, right?

11:43.032 --> 11:44.832
I believe you believe
your witness.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.567
That's it?

11:46.569 --> 11:48.569
She's one witness
out of a hundred, Eddie.

11:48.571 --> 11:50.237
And my gut.

11:50.239 --> 11:51.539
Which is all you usually have

11:51.541 --> 11:53.574
when you drag us deeper
on some case.

11:53.576 --> 11:56.677
What, I said I would go
and talk to her.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.281
You know what,
don't worry about it.

12:01.084 --> 12:03.751
Eddie, please.

12:16.265 --> 12:17.431
Hey!

12:17.433 --> 12:19.200
Nice car.

12:19.202 --> 12:22.570
Yeah, maybe I can take you
for a ride.

12:24.273 --> 12:26.113
I'll show you a place
you've never been before.

12:27.110 --> 12:28.943
Oh!

12:28.945 --> 12:30.077
Max Murdock, police.

12:30.079 --> 12:31.779
What'd I do?

12:31.781 --> 12:33.247
Same thing you always do
when someone doesn't pay.

12:33.249 --> 12:34.982
You whack 'em.

12:36.052 --> 12:38.352
I don't whack people...
(grunts)

12:38.354 --> 12:40.354
So there's another Max Murdock
at this address

12:40.356 --> 12:42.590
who's known to work as
a leg-breaker for loan sharks?

12:42.592 --> 12:45.593
I mean, I-I quit that job.
Really?

12:45.595 --> 12:48.062
'Cause two nights ago, you were
banging on some guy's door,

12:48.064 --> 12:49.096
saying you were
gonna kill him.

12:49.098 --> 12:50.197
You left your
prints all over it.

12:50.199 --> 12:52.433
What guy?
BAEZ: Curtis Fallows,

12:52.435 --> 12:54.702
the guy you gunned down
this morning in Duane Park.

12:54.704 --> 12:56.737
Curtis is dead?

12:56.739 --> 12:58.506
Oh, look at that,
he does know the guy.

12:58.508 --> 12:59.807
Uh-huh.

12:59.809 --> 13:01.742
Okay, I didn't quit that job.

13:01.744 --> 13:03.711
But you did kill him
'cause he didn't pay up.

13:03.713 --> 13:05.446
(breathing excitedly)
These porn types always pay up.

13:05.448 --> 13:07.214
Whoa, slow down, back up.

13:07.216 --> 13:09.483
What do you mean “porn types”?

13:09.485 --> 13:10.751
My boss is branching out.

13:10.753 --> 13:12.219
He's financing films
of an erotic nature.

13:12.221 --> 13:14.255
Ends up making loans
to some of 'em, too.

13:14.257 --> 13:17.458
Yeah, I'm not really catching
an alibi in any of this garbage,

13:17.460 --> 13:18.926
are you, partner?

13:18.928 --> 13:22.096
No, just a bunch of words like,
“films of an erotic nature.”

13:22.098 --> 13:23.764
(cell phone rings)

13:23.766 --> 13:26.367
I suggest you come up
with an alibi real quick,

13:26.369 --> 13:27.802
and make it a good one.

13:27.804 --> 13:29.837
Otherwise, you're gonna
be starring in your own pornos

13:29.839 --> 13:31.305
in the joint, you follow me?

13:31.307 --> 13:32.606
I was in Bensonhurt.

13:32.608 --> 13:34.809
Uh-huh.
Breaking a guy's arm.

13:34.811 --> 13:36.143
I'll give you his number,

13:36.145 --> 13:38.012
he'll tell you
I wasn't in Duane Park.

13:38.014 --> 13:40.481
Copping to assault so you don't
get locked up for murder.

13:40.483 --> 13:42.683
You're almost not
as dumb as you look.

13:42.685 --> 13:44.518
His alibi will check out.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.153
What, you're psychic now?

13:46.155 --> 13:47.354
Ten minutes ago,

13:47.356 --> 13:49.390
patrol responded
to a homicide in Kips Bay.

13:49.392 --> 13:51.792
Some guy wearing
the same kind of mask knocked

13:51.794 --> 13:54.295
on a woman's door
and killed her as she opened it.

13:54.297 --> 13:56.697
I'm guessing that's
the guy we're looking for.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.868
(exhales, coughs)

14:12.014 --> 14:14.347
Alana Robbins.

14:14.349 --> 14:16.383
26, Rhode Island license.

14:16.385 --> 14:18.618
The neighbors all describe
the killer as the guy

14:18.620 --> 14:21.288
with the heavy coat
and mask we saw in Duane Park.

14:24.893 --> 14:27.727
Stabbing's a different
M.O., though.

14:27.729 --> 14:30.697
Yeah, but I think
this was plan B.

14:30.699 --> 14:32.632
Killer must have got the gun
jammed, tossed it over here.

14:32.634 --> 14:35.302
Got up close
and personal with her.

14:35.304 --> 14:38.305
What kind of
pistol is that?

14:38.307 --> 14:40.907
Well, it's at least a .45.

14:40.909 --> 14:42.509
Choosed for hunting,
same as that knife.

14:42.511 --> 14:44.678
An outdoorsman in the city?

14:44.680 --> 14:46.947
Maybe he's from out of town.

14:46.949 --> 14:48.515
Though that doesn't explain
why he'd kill her.

14:48.517 --> 14:51.017
Because she was
a porn star, too?

14:51.019 --> 14:53.520
<i>Big Apples 6.</i>

14:53.522 --> 14:56.590
Huh, I didn't even know
there was a one through five.

14:56.592 --> 15:00.293
And <i> Taxi Driver Secrets</i>
and <i> Maids in Manhattan.</i>

15:00.295 --> 15:02.996
All produced at some place
called Cinema Kitty Studio.

15:02.998 --> 15:04.965
Well, I guess we're
gonna be calling L.A.

15:04.967 --> 15:07.701
Actually, just a drive
over to Chelsea.

15:07.703 --> 15:08.935
They make pornos in New York?

15:08.937 --> 15:10.136
Since when?

15:10.138 --> 15:11.438
Since the Internet

15:11.440 --> 15:13.907
and the 12-megapixel
camera phone came along.

15:15.177 --> 15:17.210
Well, I mean,
that's what I heard.

15:17.212 --> 15:20.180
Right. I'm sure that's
just what you've heard.

15:24.653 --> 15:26.019
Hey, Lenny.

15:26.021 --> 15:27.354
Can I have a minute?

15:29.691 --> 15:32.125
Hi, Mr. Santiago,
I'm Officer Janko.

15:32.127 --> 15:35.161
I know, you and your partner
saved me-- thank you.

15:36.265 --> 15:38.265
The way you're trying
to save whoever it was

15:38.267 --> 15:40.000
that was really
driving your car?

15:40.002 --> 15:41.968
I was driving.

15:41.970 --> 15:43.770
You were in the
passenger seat.

15:43.772 --> 15:45.405
No, it was me.

15:45.407 --> 15:46.673
I'd been drinking.

15:46.675 --> 15:48.942
Yeah, that's probably
why they were driving.

15:50.212 --> 15:52.379
But after
they hit Mia,

15:52.381 --> 15:55.181
you made them get
out of the car.

15:55.183 --> 15:57.183
And then you drove
around the block.

15:57.185 --> 15:59.152
Can you take me to jail now?

15:59.154 --> 16:00.787
Mr. Santiago,
just talk to me.

16:00.789 --> 16:03.323
I wrote down my confession.

16:03.325 --> 16:04.858
That's called making
a false statement.

16:04.860 --> 16:05.860
JAMIE:
Hey, Eddie.

16:05.861 --> 16:08.028
Hey, what's going on
here, partner?

16:08.030 --> 16:09.396
She's saying
that I'm lying.

16:09.398 --> 16:11.998
I'm saying you're doing
something wrong

16:12.000 --> 16:13.600
even if it's
for the right reasons.

16:13.602 --> 16:15.101
Eddie, let's go.

16:15.103 --> 16:16.269
Now.

16:16.271 --> 16:18.305
Because he's already
been interrogated.

16:18.307 --> 16:19.706
Detective,
I was just...

16:19.708 --> 16:21.574
Going on a little crusade,
like your partner?

16:21.576 --> 16:23.176
Excuse me?

16:23.178 --> 16:25.378
Yeah, Reagan, everyone knows
you like to kick over rocks,

16:25.380 --> 16:26.913
in hopes of finding
a promotion underneath.

16:26.915 --> 16:30.383
But your old man
is not his old man.

16:30.385 --> 16:31.985
So, you screw
with my case again,

16:31.987 --> 16:33.787
you will regret it.

16:35.090 --> 16:38.158
I'll take him down
to Central Booking myself.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.360
Let's go.

16:41.697 --> 16:42.929
Move it.

16:42.931 --> 16:44.497
EDDIE:
Mr. Santiago.

16:44.499 --> 16:47.000
Eddie, what the
hell are you doing?

16:47.002 --> 16:48.201
I'm trying
to find the truth.

16:48.203 --> 16:50.136
You got to have
more than your gut.

16:50.138 --> 16:51.304
I have a witness.

16:51.306 --> 16:52.839
Who you wouldn't
let me talk to.

16:52.841 --> 16:54.307
You know what, Reagan?

16:54.309 --> 16:56.810
I learned, like,
a million things from you.

16:56.812 --> 16:59.813
In fact, I learn something new
from you every single day.

16:59.815 --> 17:01.815
So it's time that
you learned something, too.

17:01.817 --> 17:03.049
Yeah, like what?

17:03.051 --> 17:05.719
Like to trust me.

17:19.101 --> 17:20.633
This ought
to warm you up.

17:23.872 --> 17:25.472
(clattering)
MAN: Watch out.

17:25.473 --> 17:26.473
Wait.

17:26.474 --> 17:27.474
Wait, cut.

17:27.476 --> 17:28.842
Cut!

17:30.379 --> 17:31.711
She seems talented.

17:31.713 --> 17:33.847
I'll be sure to let Linda
know you're a fan.

17:33.849 --> 17:36.816
I'm just saying, I recognize
a talent when I see it.

17:36.818 --> 17:39.018
Well, maybe we can
get you a DVD.

17:40.288 --> 17:41.321
WOMAN:
Hi.

17:41.323 --> 17:42.455
I'm Cat Holloway.

17:42.457 --> 17:43.857
Detective Reagan
and Baez.

17:43.859 --> 17:45.792
This is about Curtis
and Alana, right?

17:45.794 --> 17:46.960
You already
heard, then.

17:46.962 --> 17:47.994
Yeah, we all have.

17:47.996 --> 17:50.363
Everybody's been freaked out
all morning.

17:50.365 --> 17:52.332
Matter of fact,

17:52.334 --> 17:53.600
can we go over here?

17:53.602 --> 17:55.668
It's kind of a mood-killer,
and we're way behind.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.537
Great.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.740
So, how often did Curtis
and Alana work for you?

18:00.742 --> 18:03.009
Him a little,
her a lot.

18:03.011 --> 18:05.078
Cinema Kitty produces
women-centered

18:05.080 --> 18:06.379
sex-positive erotica.

18:06.381 --> 18:11.084
Oh, you mean like those R-rated
soft-focus, uh, porns?

18:11.086 --> 18:13.186
Uh, no, it's X-rated, but
we cater to women's fantasies.

18:13.188 --> 18:14.220
Ah.

18:14.222 --> 18:16.623
Anyone's fantasies
go unfulfilled?

18:16.625 --> 18:17.757
A disgruntled employee?

18:17.759 --> 18:19.058
Overeager fan, maybe?

18:19.060 --> 18:20.827
Not that I know of.

18:20.829 --> 18:24.564
Only problem that we've ever
had was Josie Phillips.

18:24.566 --> 18:26.800
That's, uh, one
of your stars, I take it?

18:26.802 --> 18:28.535
Yep, from
Montana, I think.

18:28.537 --> 18:29.869
Last year.

18:29.871 --> 18:31.037
BAEZ: What was
the problem?

18:31.039 --> 18:33.039
Josie started
partying too much.

18:33.041 --> 18:35.308
She stopped
showing up to work.

18:35.310 --> 18:37.544
I had to let her go.

18:37.546 --> 18:39.379
And then three
months later,

18:39.381 --> 18:42.315
she jumped off a building
in Madison Square.

18:42.317 --> 18:44.451
So? Small town girl moves
to the big city,

18:44.453 --> 18:46.820
lives the wild life
and commits suicide.

18:46.822 --> 18:49.522
Couple days later,
the cops came by.

18:49.524 --> 18:51.524
Said somebody from Montana
called and claimed

18:51.526 --> 18:55.895
that Curtis and Alana had, uh,
seduced her over the Internet.

18:55.897 --> 18:58.231
But her death was
ruled a suicide.

18:58.233 --> 18:59.933
Okay.

18:59.935 --> 19:01.301
Thanks for your time.

19:01.303 --> 19:02.936
Let me know if you
need anything else.

19:02.938 --> 19:06.873
So, maybe the “someone
from Montana” wasn't happy

19:06.875 --> 19:09.275
about that,
and decided to get even?

19:09.277 --> 19:11.478
Yeah, her dad.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.146
So now you're
a psychic?

19:13.148 --> 19:15.014
No, but I am a father.

19:20.755 --> 19:23.297
The Cold Case Squad has sent
over their file on DeCarlo.

19:23.321 --> 19:24.492
Mm-hmm.

19:24.493 --> 19:27.994
I have our people tracking down
all of the old witnesses.

19:27.996 --> 19:30.997
And your 4:30 is
a half an hour early,

19:30.999 --> 19:32.665
so I put him
in your office.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.100
Uh, okay.

19:35.036 --> 19:36.469
What was wrong
with the lobby?

19:36.471 --> 19:38.471
He said
the chairs suck.

19:38.473 --> 19:40.974
Thank you, Morgan.

19:45.146 --> 19:47.714
Look who's raring to go.

19:47.716 --> 19:51.284
I've been waiting a
long time for this.

19:51.286 --> 19:54.287
Okay, then why don't you walk me
through the facts of the case.

19:54.289 --> 19:55.822
Do you want
to refresh your memory?

19:55.824 --> 19:57.090
Don't need to.

19:57.092 --> 19:59.158
Remember that day like it
happened yesterday.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.660
Well, I wasn't
even born, yet.

20:00.662 --> 20:02.195
So I'm gonna cheat.

20:03.698 --> 20:05.498
Okay.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.369
Report says that at 10:45 hours
on January 14, 19...

20:09.371 --> 20:11.437
1977.

20:11.439 --> 20:12.939
I'm in a radio car
in the Bowery

20:12.941 --> 20:15.909
when Steve Dixon
calls for backup

20:15.911 --> 20:17.877
because he's chasing
a kid for a burglary,

20:17.879 --> 20:20.580
when a bunch of other kids
start throwing bottles at him.

20:20.582 --> 20:21.848
Are you sure about that?

20:21.850 --> 20:23.516
Which part?

20:23.518 --> 20:25.552
DD-5 says 1976.

20:25.554 --> 20:27.520
What'd I say?
'77.

20:27.522 --> 20:28.855
Same difference.

20:28.857 --> 20:30.990
Anyway, I arrive
on the scene.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.825
And, sure enough,
there's Steve,

20:32.827 --> 20:35.728
surrounded in the courtyard
of this apartment building

20:35.730 --> 20:38.031
at 444 South Doyle.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.198
Uh... (clears throat)

20:39.200 --> 20:41.367
And... (sighs)

20:41.369 --> 20:42.502
What?

20:42.504 --> 20:45.104
It says 448 East Harvey.

20:45.106 --> 20:46.372
(sighs)

20:46.374 --> 20:50.376
The only thing that matters
is that I saw Donald DeCarlo

20:50.378 --> 20:52.211
with a Saturday night
special in his hand,

20:52.213 --> 20:54.814
and the next thing you
know, Dixon is dead.

20:56.151 --> 20:58.751
That's all a jury
needs to hear.

21:16.571 --> 21:18.805
Detectives Baez and Reagan.

21:18.807 --> 21:20.373
We're looking
for Jerry Phillips?

21:20.375 --> 21:21.908
My husband went for a walk.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.077
Do you know where to, ma'am?

21:24.079 --> 21:25.678
No, he just likes to walk.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.348
We called your place in Montana
to ask you some questions

21:28.350 --> 21:30.316
and found out
you were in New York.

21:30.318 --> 21:32.285
Oh, well, is there a problem?

21:32.287 --> 21:34.854
A lot of people visit New York.

21:34.856 --> 21:36.823
Do you mind if we come in,
Mrs. Phillips?

21:36.825 --> 21:38.658
Oh, not at all.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.093
Forgive the mess.

21:40.095 --> 21:42.395
Housekeeping hasn't been by yet.

21:42.397 --> 21:45.698
So, how long have you
and your husband been in town?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.000
Uh, three days.

21:47.002 --> 21:49.035
It's a little overwhelming.

21:49.037 --> 21:50.970
You on vacation?

21:50.972 --> 21:53.439
Yes. Well, I mean, not exactly.

21:53.441 --> 21:56.242
We came to lay roses

21:56.244 --> 21:58.978
where our daughter
passed away last year.

22:02.617 --> 22:03.950
But you haven't yet?

22:03.952 --> 22:06.119
(grunts)

22:07.355 --> 22:09.355
Every day, we say,

22:09.357 --> 22:12.959
“Today we'll go.”

22:12.961 --> 22:16.162
And then Jerry says
he's not ready.

22:16.965 --> 22:18.998
It's got to be tough.

22:22.370 --> 22:23.936
Does your husband hunt, ma'am?

22:27.442 --> 22:29.142
Why are you asking me this?

22:29.144 --> 22:31.344
Reagan.

22:31.346 --> 22:32.812
I got something.

22:34.816 --> 22:36.883
An indentation from the top page
that's been ripped off.

22:36.885 --> 22:39.052
Did you write this,
Mrs. Phillips?

22:39.054 --> 22:40.253
No, Jerry did.

22:40.255 --> 22:42.655
It's an address.

22:42.657 --> 22:43.723
You think?

22:43.725 --> 22:45.558
Only one way to find out.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.061
Wait, what's going on?

22:48.063 --> 22:49.462
Sorry to take up your time.

22:49.464 --> 22:50.897
Have a nice day.

22:50.899 --> 22:53.032
Be safe in the city.

22:58.006 --> 23:01.708
Well, how many details
did he get wrong?

23:01.710 --> 23:03.309
More than he got right.

23:03.311 --> 23:06.846
He can review his notes
before he takes the stand.

23:06.848 --> 23:08.614
Dad, we're talking
about Grandpa here.

23:08.616 --> 23:11.050
A defense attorney
starts hammering him

23:11.052 --> 23:12.719
about some inconsistency,

23:12.721 --> 23:14.620
Grandpa is gonna
start hammering back

23:14.622 --> 23:16.022
and down goes the gavel.

23:16.024 --> 23:17.757
Yeah, I know.

23:17.759 --> 23:20.493
He's the only witness we've got.

23:21.396 --> 23:22.895
There were ten
other witnesses there.

23:22.897 --> 23:25.231
And half of them did not
see DeCarlo with a gun.

23:25.233 --> 23:26.499
The other half are either dead

23:26.501 --> 23:28.701
or unreachable.

23:33.141 --> 23:36.042
Which is why I am thinking
of a plea deal.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.047
You don't want to plead out
a cop killer.

23:41.049 --> 23:42.049
No, I don't.

23:42.050 --> 23:43.816
But it's better than nothing,

23:43.818 --> 23:45.952
and that's pretty much
what I've got right now.

23:45.954 --> 23:48.721
Look...

23:48.723 --> 23:51.324
Pop's been after this guy
for 40 years,

23:51.326 --> 23:53.392
and he handed it down to me.

23:53.394 --> 23:55.461
And I gave it to Joe,

23:55.463 --> 23:56.662
and then to Danny.

23:56.664 --> 23:59.298
I can't let it go at a discount.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.400
You can't look at it
that way, Dad.

24:01.402 --> 24:04.704
Erin, I can't look at it
any other way.

24:17.118 --> 24:18.384
All right, thanks.

24:18.386 --> 24:19.886
You find out
who lives here?

24:19.888 --> 24:21.654
The porn director
from that set we were on,

24:21.656 --> 24:23.422
Jake Gayley.
Jake Gayley.

24:23.424 --> 24:25.224
(gunshots)
Shots fired!

24:47.015 --> 24:48.681
Police!

24:48.683 --> 24:50.883
Coming in!

24:52.754 --> 24:54.587
Everybody okay?!

25:09.337 --> 25:11.504
Don't move, you.

25:15.043 --> 25:16.475
Get the mask off.

25:16.477 --> 25:18.010
Come on.

25:18.012 --> 25:19.712
Now.

25:25.086 --> 25:26.853
Jerry Phillips?

25:27.689 --> 25:31.324
They killed my daughter.

25:45.233 --> 25:47.934
Detectives, I don't know
what you want me to say.

25:47.936 --> 25:50.704
Okay, so you confess
to killing Alana Robbins,

25:50.706 --> 25:52.339
Jake Gayley and Curtis Fallows.

25:52.341 --> 25:54.107
Yes.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.844
For what they did to
my daughter, they deserved it.

25:57.846 --> 26:00.146
This department didn't think

26:00.148 --> 26:01.948
they even deserved
to be arrested.

26:01.950 --> 26:04.017
This department?

26:04.019 --> 26:05.385
You heard her.

26:05.387 --> 26:07.821
All I heard was excuses

26:07.823 --> 26:09.456
why nothing could be proven,

26:09.458 --> 26:11.591
why none of them
could be charged.

26:11.593 --> 26:14.160
There are such things as laws.

26:14.162 --> 26:15.829
There's also what's right.

26:15.831 --> 26:17.030
So you decide to play God?

26:17.032 --> 26:18.298
Is that what you did?

26:18.300 --> 26:21.801
“For if there was harm,
you shall appoint as penalty

26:21.803 --> 26:24.738
life for life, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth.”

26:24.740 --> 26:27.073
Exodus 21:23.

26:27.075 --> 26:29.275
“Do not take vengeance
against evil,

26:29.277 --> 26:32.212
but wait for the Lord,
and He will avenge you.”

26:32.214 --> 26:33.546
Proverbs 20:22.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.382
You ever had a child die?

26:35.384 --> 26:37.150
Almost.

26:37.152 --> 26:39.686
And a broken heart is no excuse
for what the hell you did!

26:39.688 --> 26:41.721
I came to you people for help,

26:41.723 --> 26:43.189
and nothing happened!

26:43.191 --> 26:44.624
I am not

26:44.626 --> 26:46.459
a smart man

26:46.461 --> 26:48.395
or a rich man,

26:48.397 --> 26:51.030
but I am a family man.

26:51.032 --> 26:53.800
And as such, I did what's right.

26:53.802 --> 26:56.035
Really?
Yes, I did!

27:10.752 --> 27:13.353
HENRY: ...which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

27:13.355 --> 27:15.121
though Christ our Lord. Amen.

27:15.123 --> 27:16.523
ALL:
Amen.

27:19.528 --> 27:21.828
Lot of opinions being thrown
around on talk radio

27:21.830 --> 27:23.997
about what to do
with that DeCarlo guy.

27:23.999 --> 27:25.365
Since when do you listen
to talk radio?

27:25.367 --> 27:27.300
Since you haven't fixed
the CD player in the car.

27:27.302 --> 27:30.470
Talk radio is just that:
all talk.

27:30.472 --> 27:31.938
Is he the man
you looked for forever?

27:31.940 --> 27:34.107
Yep. Then your grandpa

27:34.109 --> 27:36.910
took over, and then your father.

27:36.912 --> 27:38.044
What did he do?

27:38.046 --> 27:39.546
He shot and killed a cop,
that's what he did.

27:39.548 --> 27:40.847
Allegedly.

27:42.083 --> 27:43.416
Listen,

27:43.418 --> 27:45.585
Pop saw DeCarlo
shoot Steve Dixon,

27:45.587 --> 27:48.021
and eyewitness testimony
from a fellow police officer

27:48.023 --> 27:49.856
goes a long way.

27:49.858 --> 27:52.559
If that's what I really saw.

27:57.732 --> 27:59.365
Look, I know I screwed up

27:59.367 --> 28:01.568
a lot of the details with Erin
the other day.

28:01.570 --> 28:03.136
It's almost 40 years.

28:03.138 --> 28:05.538
I'm sure your original report
reflects what happened, Pop.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.906
I wish I was so sure.

28:06.908 --> 28:09.108
40 years is a long time.

28:09.110 --> 28:11.311
DANNY: Come on, Gramps.
You've been carrying this around

28:11.313 --> 28:12.512
half your life.

28:12.514 --> 28:14.547
You're just gonna pull
the thread on it now?

28:15.484 --> 28:16.749
JAMIE: Yeah, no matter
who remembers what,

28:16.751 --> 28:18.084
DeCarlo still has to pay.

28:18.086 --> 28:21.120
But first,
we got to build a case.

28:22.390 --> 28:24.791
You know what you saw, Pop.

28:31.466 --> 28:33.900
I didn't say I changed my mind.

28:45.814 --> 28:47.447
What are we doing here?

28:47.449 --> 28:49.048
Seeing if you're right.

28:49.050 --> 28:50.950
I'm not following.

28:50.952 --> 28:52.352
I called the lady
who thought

28:52.354 --> 28:54.587
there was another person
in the car.

28:54.589 --> 28:56.556
You did not.

28:56.558 --> 28:57.957
Yeah, then I did

28:57.959 --> 28:59.359
some poking around
Ted's life.

28:59.361 --> 29:02.395
Saw what he might have been up
to the day that Mia was hit

29:02.397 --> 29:03.663
and who he might
have been with.

29:03.665 --> 29:04.964
(school bell ringing)
Well, who was it?

29:04.966 --> 29:07.166
I'll talk to you guys later.

29:08.670 --> 29:10.069
Carlos Santiago?

29:10.071 --> 29:12.338
Yeah?

29:13.675 --> 29:15.041
Relax. You're not in trouble.

29:15.043 --> 29:16.142
Yeah, in fact,

29:16.144 --> 29:17.477
uh, congratulations
are in order.

29:17.479 --> 29:19.112
Heard you had a great meeting
with the recruiter

29:19.114 --> 29:20.980
from Vanderbilt last Thursday.

29:20.982 --> 29:22.815
How do you know that?

29:22.817 --> 29:24.183
Uh, we're cops.

29:24.185 --> 29:25.451
We find out stuff.

29:26.788 --> 29:29.022
Yeah, you know, I always
wondered about those meetings.

29:29.024 --> 29:30.557
What do they do?

29:30.559 --> 29:32.759
Like, get you
into a fancy hotel suite,

29:32.761 --> 29:34.360
give your dad a few drinks,
loosen him up,

29:34.362 --> 29:36.529
and then they hit you
with the pitch?

29:36.531 --> 29:38.798
My dad doesn't drink.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.668
Well, he was arrested
for driving while intoxicated

29:41.670 --> 29:44.003
about an hour
after your meeting.

29:44.005 --> 29:47.707
I mean, I didn't see him
have any drinks that day.

29:47.709 --> 29:49.742
Yeah, you did.

29:49.744 --> 29:52.278
That's why you drove home.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.680
Like a good son.

29:53.682 --> 29:56.816
No, I-I took the bus home.

29:56.818 --> 29:59.252
Yeah, you took the bus home
after you accidentally hit Mia,

29:59.254 --> 30:01.321
and your dad made you get
out of the car

30:01.323 --> 30:02.722
to keep you
from losing everything

30:02.724 --> 30:04.424
you've worked so hard
to achieve.

30:06.094 --> 30:08.027
Like a good dad.

30:08.830 --> 30:10.463
Listen, Carlos,

30:10.465 --> 30:12.865
we can't force you
to tell the truth.

30:12.867 --> 30:14.934
In fact,

30:14.936 --> 30:16.302
you can walk away right now,

30:16.304 --> 30:19.305
and all this goes away.

30:19.307 --> 30:21.441
JAMIE:
But how is it gonna feel,

30:21.443 --> 30:23.009
playing without your dad
cheering for you

30:23.011 --> 30:24.444
in the bleachers

30:24.446 --> 30:26.579
all because
you let him go to jail

30:26.581 --> 30:28.047
for a mistake that you made?

30:28.049 --> 30:30.249
He was alone in that car.

30:31.686 --> 30:34.387
So I am walking away.

30:43.365 --> 30:45.898
DANNY:
<i>What do you mean,</i>

30:45.900 --> 30:47.867
there's something hinky
with our case?

30:47.869 --> 30:49.102
Would prefer “funky”?

30:49.104 --> 30:50.570
We caught the killer, Doc.

30:50.572 --> 30:52.138
No, you caught a killer.

30:52.140 --> 30:53.339
What?

30:53.341 --> 30:54.774
First and third victims.

30:54.776 --> 30:56.009
.45 caliber bullet

30:56.011 --> 30:59.145
through the scrotum and torso.
Right.

30:59.147 --> 31:00.380
Angle of indicates a shooter

31:00.382 --> 31:02.148
who's approximately
five-foot-ten.

31:02.150 --> 31:03.216
That's what our guy is.

31:03.218 --> 31:04.350
Right.

31:04.352 --> 31:05.718
Your second victim, however,

31:05.720 --> 31:07.153
killed using a different M.O.

31:07.155 --> 31:08.621
His gun jammed;
he improvised.

31:08.623 --> 31:10.189
Right, serrated hunting knife,

31:10.191 --> 31:11.991
single stab wound
to the left chest.

31:11.993 --> 31:14.293
What the hell is hinky
about that?

31:14.295 --> 31:17.563
An attacker who's five-foot-ten
would angle more down

31:17.565 --> 31:19.298
into the victim's sternum.

31:19.300 --> 31:22.468
The angle on Ms. Robbins
is more level

31:22.470 --> 31:24.170
indicating an attacker

31:24.172 --> 31:26.439
who's no more
than five-foot-six.

31:26.441 --> 31:29.142
So a shorter man.

31:29.144 --> 31:30.309
Possibly.

31:30.311 --> 31:33.413
But the depth of penetration
is markedly less

31:33.415 --> 31:34.914
than typically associated

31:34.916 --> 31:36.816
with the upper body strength
of a male.

31:36.818 --> 31:38.818
Oh...

31:38.820 --> 31:40.219
So, a shorter woman.

31:40.221 --> 31:41.788
Son of a bitch.

31:41.790 --> 31:43.656
It couldn't be.

31:43.658 --> 31:44.957
Women hunt.

31:44.959 --> 31:45.925
Janice?

31:45.927 --> 31:47.493
Who else could it be?

31:47.495 --> 31:49.429
Thanks, Doc.
Come on, we gotta go.

31:58.807 --> 32:00.840
Detective Miller, sir.

32:00.842 --> 32:02.175
(sighs)

32:02.177 --> 32:03.843
Thank you, Baker.

32:07.782 --> 32:08.948
Commissioner.

32:08.950 --> 32:11.350
As you were.

32:11.352 --> 32:12.752
Have a seat.

32:25.867 --> 32:28.968
Do you know why
I detained your father

32:28.970 --> 32:30.303
after the promotion
ceremony?

32:30.305 --> 32:32.004
Yes, sir.
He told me about it.

32:33.975 --> 32:35.842
Told you what, exactly?

32:35.844 --> 32:39.779
Well, he said that there was
an incident when he was a kid,

32:39.781 --> 32:41.948
a... a cop that had been
shot and killed,

32:41.950 --> 32:44.617
and that he might have been
at the scene at the time.

32:44.619 --> 32:45.852
“Might have been”?

32:45.854 --> 32:47.019
Yes, sir.

32:47.021 --> 32:48.955
He said that it was
almost 40 years ago.

32:48.957 --> 32:50.289
He said he barely remembered it.

32:50.291 --> 32:52.592
Well...

32:52.594 --> 32:54.327
after the shooting,

32:54.329 --> 32:57.563
he went into hiding
and changed his name.

33:00.034 --> 33:02.702
He left that part out.

33:02.704 --> 33:06.839
Your father's real name
is Donald DeCarlo.

33:07.675 --> 33:09.175
My father

33:09.177 --> 33:12.378
was on the job
and on the scene.

33:12.380 --> 33:15.348
He thought then,
and we think now,

33:15.350 --> 33:17.950
that DeCarlo was the shooter.

33:19.954 --> 33:23.089
Sir, I swear, I have
no knowledge of any of this.

33:28.630 --> 33:31.531
(clears throat)

33:31.533 --> 33:36.602
The district attorney's office
believes that, uh...

33:36.604 --> 33:39.205
we do not have a solid case,

33:39.207 --> 33:41.374
as is.

33:43.311 --> 33:46.012
Look, uh...

33:46.014 --> 33:49.148
I would never ask you to testify
against your father.

33:49.150 --> 33:52.351
Commissioner, I have
no testimony against him.

33:52.353 --> 33:54.987
But if you asked him...

33:54.989 --> 33:57.490
Sir?

33:57.492 --> 34:00.226
...would he tell you the truth?

34:03.298 --> 34:04.397
I don't know.

34:04.399 --> 34:07.533
Would you be willing
to find out?

34:07.535 --> 34:09.302
Ask my dad
if he killed that cop?

34:09.304 --> 34:10.503
Yes.

34:11.773 --> 34:14.273
While wearing a wire?

34:16.878 --> 34:18.077
Yes.

34:20.481 --> 34:22.348
As an NYPD detective,

34:22.350 --> 34:23.649
trying to close the case

34:23.650 --> 34:26.452
on a murdered fellow officer.

34:29.290 --> 34:31.958
(sighs)

34:31.960 --> 34:34.092
Detective Miller,

34:34.094 --> 34:36.295
this is not an order.

34:37.398 --> 34:41.100
I want you to know
I am sincerely sorry

34:41.101 --> 34:43.636
for what I'm asking you to do.

34:44.806 --> 34:48.940
I think I understand the burden,

34:48.943 --> 34:52.678
the... sheer weight

34:52.679 --> 34:55.648
that I am putting
on your shoulders.

34:57.785 --> 35:01.687
And I will understand
if you don't do it.

35:01.689 --> 35:05.191
In which case, this conversation
never happened.

35:08.830 --> 35:12.798
But I am asking.

35:33.697 --> 35:35.864
Janice Phillips!

35:37.367 --> 35:38.700
When we served
the search warrant,

35:38.702 --> 35:40.836
she said she was going
back to Montana right away.

35:40.838 --> 35:42.571
Maybe she had
more hunting to do.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.773
Not using a gun.
We found all of Jerry's.

35:44.775 --> 35:46.041
Well, she's handy
with a knife.

35:46.043 --> 35:48.043
You could find those
easy enough in the city.

35:48.045 --> 35:49.477
Well, who would
she go after?

35:49.479 --> 35:50.579
Cat Holloway would know.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.314
She might even
be on the list. (line ringing)

35:52.316 --> 35:54.282
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

35:54.284 --> 35:55.984
CAT (recording): Cinema Kitty Studios.
Leave a message.

35:55.986 --> 35:57.652
Nothing.

35:57.654 --> 35:58.787
No answer?
No.

35:58.789 --> 35:59.721
I'm driving.

35:59.723 --> 36:01.523
You try
her again.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.996
(clattering, glass breaking
nearby)

36:07.998 --> 36:09.798
Is somebody there?

36:16.240 --> 36:18.440
Hello?

36:21.111 --> 36:23.545
Is there anybody there?

36:23.547 --> 36:26.381
Hello?

36:32.689 --> 36:33.488
(shouts)

36:33.490 --> 36:35.824
(grunting)

36:41.498 --> 36:43.265
(moans, grunting)

36:46.937 --> 36:49.137
(panting)

36:57.281 --> 36:58.980
(moans)

36:58.982 --> 37:01.182
(panting)

37:07.157 --> 37:09.591
(shouts)

37:09.593 --> 37:13.695
(grunting)

37:20.203 --> 37:22.203
It's your turn.

37:22.205 --> 37:24.472
It's your turn.

37:24.474 --> 37:27.142
DANNY: Let her go, Janice!
No!

37:27.144 --> 37:28.610
No!

37:28.612 --> 37:29.577
Let her go!

37:29.579 --> 37:30.779
Help. (coughs)
No.

37:30.781 --> 37:31.813
Let her go
right now.

37:31.815 --> 37:33.882
(sobbing): No.
Help.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.483
Cover me.
Help.

37:35.485 --> 37:36.584
Help... me.

37:36.586 --> 37:38.787
No, no! No. No!

37:38.789 --> 37:42.090
Let her go! Let her go.
(coughing, gasping)

37:42.092 --> 37:44.092
(sobbing):
No.

37:44.094 --> 37:46.628
She killed our daughter.

37:46.630 --> 37:48.096
They all killed

37:48.098 --> 37:50.598
our daughter.
5-4 detectives to Central.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.269
We need a bus
at 182 West 20th Street.

37:54.271 --> 37:56.271
Female's been stabbed
at this location.

37:56.273 --> 37:58.673
(sobbing)

37:58.675 --> 38:04.579
We had to make them pay
for what they did to J-Josie.

38:05.749 --> 38:08.416
All you did was make other
families pay in the process.

38:08.418 --> 38:10.752
You and Jerry can think about
that while you're locked up

38:10.754 --> 38:12.387
for the rest of your lives.

38:12.389 --> 38:15.790
(siren chirping)
(Jamie sighs)

38:15.792 --> 38:17.058
Another day, another dollar.

38:17.060 --> 38:19.861
How 'bout Uptown Burger
Palace? My treat.

38:19.863 --> 38:21.363
What for?

38:21.365 --> 38:23.865
Believing me about
Ted Santiago.

38:23.867 --> 38:25.433
I just wish it worked.

38:25.435 --> 38:27.369
BUCKLEY:
Janko, Reagan,

38:27.371 --> 38:29.671
you two really are something,
aren't you?

38:29.673 --> 38:31.172
Got to get the gold star,
even if it means

38:31.174 --> 38:33.375
stepping on another cop's back?

38:33.377 --> 38:34.509
That's not what we were doing,
Detective.

38:34.511 --> 38:35.877
Then why the hell
do I get a call

38:35.879 --> 38:38.146
from Ted Santiago yelling
about cops

38:38.148 --> 38:39.714
harassing his son at school?

38:39.716 --> 38:41.549
Oh, you mean the son
you never interviewed?

38:41.551 --> 38:44.452
You know what, let's find out
what your sergeant thinks

38:44.454 --> 38:46.254
about you going
off the reservation.

38:46.256 --> 38:47.989
I'm sure he'd like to hear
about how you handled the case.

38:47.991 --> 38:50.225
Great.
Great.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.962
Detective Buckley?

38:54.798 --> 38:56.164
Here you go,

38:56.166 --> 38:57.732
a formal complaint.

38:58.635 --> 39:00.502
Only complaint I have
is about these two.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.070
Go on. Tell her.

39:03.507 --> 39:06.708
My dad wasn't driving
when that kid got hit.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.576
I was.

39:09.913 --> 39:10.979
What?

39:12.215 --> 39:15.116
Then I took the blame and tried
to keep him out of trouble.

39:15.118 --> 39:17.552
Bad enough when he got arrested
the other day.

39:17.554 --> 39:19.254
Then I find out
what they really did?

39:19.256 --> 39:21.122
Nuh-uh. Not in my house.

39:21.124 --> 39:24.259
Baseball isn't half as important
as doing the right thing.

39:24.261 --> 39:26.361
Smart lady.

39:26.363 --> 39:28.263
Yeah, she is.

39:29.699 --> 39:31.733
All right,
let's go up to the squad

39:31.735 --> 39:33.501
and get this all sorted out.

39:36.206 --> 39:38.006
(quietly):
Thank you.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.946
(chuckles)

39:44.948 --> 39:47.048
You still want
to go get that burger?

39:47.050 --> 39:49.684
(chuckles)

39:55.692 --> 39:57.892
Donald DeCarlo.

40:01.231 --> 40:04.265
(sighs)

40:04.267 --> 40:06.935
What is it now?

40:06.937 --> 40:09.270
We got you.

40:09.272 --> 40:10.805
You got squat.

40:10.807 --> 40:13.675
Confessing on tape.

40:13.677 --> 40:16.077
I didn't go on any tape.

40:16.079 --> 40:17.779
You didn't know
you were going on tape.

40:17.781 --> 40:19.380
Big difference.

40:24.187 --> 40:27.322
Did you order him to do it?

40:29.392 --> 40:31.493
Yes, I did.

40:31.495 --> 40:35.763
But you're the one
who raised an NYPD detective.

40:38.435 --> 40:39.968
What are you smiling at?

40:39.970 --> 40:43.304
I've waited 40 years

40:43.306 --> 40:46.474
to see the look on your face.

40:46.476 --> 40:49.511
It was worth it.

40:51.815 --> 40:53.414
Jimmy?

40:58.622 --> 41:01.422
Donald DeCarlo,
you are under arrest

41:01.424 --> 41:04.859
for the murder of
Police Officer Steven Dixon.

41:04.861 --> 41:07.362
(handcuffs clicking) You have the right
to remain silent

41:07.364 --> 41:09.063
and refuse
to answer questions.

41:09.065 --> 41:10.431
Anything you do say

41:10.433 --> 41:13.134
may be used against you
in a court of law.

41:13.136 --> 41:15.336
You have the right
to consult an attorney

41:15.338 --> 41:17.739
and to have an attorney present
during any questioning now

41:17.741 --> 41:19.207
or in the
future...

41:19.209 --> 41:21.309
And that's that.
