00:27.402 --> 00:30.113
First video game you ever
masturbated to. On three.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.906
- No.
- Yes, dude.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.451
- One, two...
- No, Steph, I'm not doin' this.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.911
...three. <i>Tetris</i> or <i>Donkey Kong, Jr.</i>

00:36.911 --> 00:38.329
It happened on the same day,

00:38.329 --> 00:39.581
don't remember which was first,

00:39.581 --> 00:42.292
and... I don't care
that you didn't answer.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.544
Great.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.212
Hey, uh, the programmers are asking

00:46.212 --> 00:47.839
when you'll have the new
concept drawings ready

00:47.839 --> 00:49.549
for Cyprian's apprentice.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.843
Um, Tuesday, probably.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.803
Um, I forgot to tell you,

00:53.803 --> 00:56.639
I-- it's my brother's
band recital tonight.

00:56.639 --> 00:59.267
And we're doin' this whole
family dinner thing after,

00:59.267 --> 01:02.062
so I figure I'll just stay at my dad's.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.980
So, I'm alone tonight?

01:04.147 --> 01:05.315
I'll make it up to you.

01:05.523 --> 01:08.026
- I'll miss you.
I'll miss you, too.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.079
Do we definitely like her?

01:20.163 --> 01:23.166
Yes... Yes, we do.

01:56.991 --> 01:58.201
Fiona?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.059
What the fuck are you doing here?!

02:23.643 --> 02:25.103
(sighs) Bro,

02:25.228 --> 02:27.147
I know this hurts right now,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.731
but in the long run,

02:28.731 --> 02:30.817
it's only gonna make you stronger.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.405
I thought his brother had a band thing.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.240

06:25.468 --> 06:26.803

06:30.223 --> 06:34.185

06:34.185 --> 06:36.145
Houston, we have a moron.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.358
New conference room.
It's causing mass injuries.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.068
I could do this all day.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.946
Well, I hate to interrupt,
but I have a pretty big update

06:44.946 --> 06:46.823
on that project we've been discussing.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.241
You didn't fuckin' do it, did you?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.118
I knew he couldn't fuckin' do it.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.122
Well... as a matter of fact...

06:58.334 --> 06:59.961
Bypass that.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.720
- Jimmy fucking did it!
- Ah yeah!

07:09.720 --> 07:12.390
Jimmy likes it like that.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.267
<i>Ay caramba.</i>

07:14.559 --> 07:16.352
<i>-</i> What are you doing?
- Dude, what are you doing to him?

07:16.352 --> 07:17.603
What?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.647
Nothing. Stop.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.108
- How did you figure this out?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.901
He used a point-to-point
tunneling protocol,

07:23.901 --> 07:26.362
which is a very complicated
and very difficult thing to do

07:26.362 --> 07:27.822
because he's a genius.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.074
Tell 'em your SAT score.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.577
1570 and it should've been a 1600,

07:32.577 --> 07:35.079
but they had those
two ridiculous analogies.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.249
I just messed around for a while.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.294
- We are taking you out to celebrate.
- Yes.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.920
What are we celebrating, fellas?

07:42.920 --> 07:44.881
Jimmy took down the porn firewall.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.966
Today is like our very own
Independence Day.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.092
Heck yeah!

07:48.092 --> 07:49.177
You're not invited, Chris!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.178
Sounds good!

07:53.347 --> 07:56.559
- Oh! I see nipple.
- Ooh!

07:57.602 --> 08:00.938
You think you're gonna
have a job on January 1st?

08:00.938 --> 08:03.691
There's not even
gonna be banks after Y2K.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.817
There's not even gonna be money.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.819
We're talkin' total so--

08:06.819 --> 08:08.988
sosial breakdown, man.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.073
Almost nothing will survive.

08:11.073 --> 08:14.243
Tell them about the patch.
Wait until they hear this.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.621
You know, there's actually
a pretty simple way to patch

08:16.621 --> 08:18.206
the code in most legacy systems...

08:18.206 --> 08:20.124
They're gonna lose
their minds. Look at 'em.

08:20.124 --> 08:24.086
...and that way, you basically
avoid the Y2K problem altogether.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.046
How do you guys decide?

09:49.046 --> 09:51.424
- Tightest shirt.
- Tightest pants.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.184
Nice pants.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.022

until he quite literally wept.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.566
I'm just here to make sure he's okay.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.651
That's it.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.075
Random Lindsay?

15:52.493 --> 15:56.163
Uh, I was looking for... Jimmy.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.124
Uh-huh... You two bang or what?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.294
- Jimmy, Jimmy.
Yeah.

16:02.294 --> 16:06.048
Hey, buddy, you have a visitor.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.219
You know, for some reason,

16:10.219 --> 16:13.764
she thought my office was your office.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.768
Gonna have to give me the scoop
on that one later, bruh.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.486
What's up?

16:27.653 --> 16:28.654
"What's up?"

16:29.697 --> 16:32.074
So, you, uh, you told
your friends what happened?

16:32.074 --> 16:34.326
No. No, they saw us leave together.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.579
Hm, so this, this is your... office?

16:37.579 --> 16:40.040
Why did I think you worked down the hall?

16:40.332 --> 16:41.834
Well, I think you'd have to admit,

16:41.834 --> 16:44.044
I never explicitly said
that that office was mine.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.714
Oh, would I? Would I have to admit that?

16:46.714 --> 16:49.258
He's an analyst. A baby banker.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.760
Sorry, I've been listening in.
I'll, I'll go now.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.262
Hey, maybe we should...
talk somewhere else.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.805
Hang on.
Why does this say "Miguel"?

16:57.057 --> 16:59.309
- That's my name.
- Oh.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.396
Nice. Are there any other lies
I should know about or?

17:02.396 --> 17:05.399
All right, look, I don't know
what you thought last night was,

17:05.399 --> 17:07.860
but I'm not really
in a place for a relationship.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.572
A relationship? You, you think
I want a relationship?

17:11.572 --> 17:12.656
Well,

17:13.323 --> 17:15.242
I mean... you brought cupcakes.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.536
Yeah, 'cause I was concerned.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.080
You ran out of the office
last night with your pants off, sobbing.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.999
- Okay--
Wait, what did you just say?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.334
Uh, sorry, I really am gonna leave now.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.003
All right, let's definitely
talk somewhere else.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.047
- The kitchen is right--
- Wanna know the worst part about it?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.758
I, actually, had an orgasm.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.384
Yeah, my first orgasm

17:32.384 --> 17:34.470
that I've ever had with anyone else.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.597
And I have been so screwed up
in my head wondering,

17:36.597 --> 17:39.224
"Oh, did I have it
even though he was crying,

17:39.224 --> 17:41.935
or did I have it...
because he was crying?"

17:43.645 --> 17:45.814
- Which one was it?
- I don't know!

17:47.357 --> 17:50.861
All I know is that I am sick
and tired of everyone telling me

17:50.861 --> 17:52.905
what I'm supposed to do
and who I'm supposed to be

17:52.905 --> 17:54.740
because I know exactly who I am.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.659
I'm a New Yorker and I don't
give an "s" about "s"!

17:57.659 --> 17:59.745
Oh my...

18:01.830 --> 18:03.165
Can you make him leave?

18:03.290 --> 18:04.917
It's my cubicle.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.044
I'm only here to make sure no one is dead

18:07.044 --> 18:08.796
or needs to be rushed to a hospital.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.298
You look A-okay to me, random Lindso.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.592
But you should be monitored
every hour

18:13.592 --> 18:15.552
for the next 12 hours for a concussion.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.387
Do you have family
you can call to come get you?

18:17.387 --> 18:20.474
- They live in Vermont.
A friend?

18:28.607 --> 18:29.775
Can you tell me what day it is?

18:29.775 --> 18:31.151
Oh, my God.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.445
- Can you?
- Still Friday.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.989
Just like it was when you
asked me five minutes ago.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.157
Current president?

18:37.157 --> 18:38.450
Still Clinton.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.870
And... how do you feel about me?

18:42.412 --> 18:44.414
- Still unfavorably.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.916
Yeah, you seem fine.

18:45.916 --> 18:50.671
Okay... Thank you so much.
This is good. I'm good. Goodbye.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.548
This is your building?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.841
It is not.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.302
You don't want me to know
which building's yours?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.638
That's correct, yes.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.598
All right, well,
why don't I get your number

19:01.598 --> 19:03.433
and that way
I can give you a call in an hour

19:03.433 --> 19:04.560
and make sure you're okay.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.145
You don't have to do that.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.814
- I have a roommate.
- Well, I'd like to call anyway.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.732
I feel bad.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.151
For being an asshole?

19:13.068 --> 19:17.406
For... being not entirely
forthright about certain things

19:17.406 --> 19:20.325
which I should have been...
forthright about.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.910
So, for being an asshole?

19:22.327 --> 19:23.328
Sure.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.048
Hello?

19:35.048 --> 19:36.425
Still conscious?

19:36.925 --> 19:38.218
Apparently.

19:38.468 --> 19:41.471
That's good...
I'll talk to you in an hour.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.223
You know, you don't have to do this

19:43.223 --> 19:44.975
to try to prove you're a good guy.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.771
I think you already know I'm a good guy.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.038
Since you refuse to stop calling me,

20:08.040 --> 20:09.875
- can I ask you something?
- Okay.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.337
<i>Why do your friends
call you Jimmy?</i>

20:14.588 --> 20:15.589
Um...

20:17.090 --> 20:18.508
my last name is Jimenez,

20:18.508 --> 20:21.011
but the guys at work all think
it's pronounced Gym-en-ez,

20:21.011 --> 20:23.680
and it all just started from there.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.974
And that doesn't bother you?

20:27.184 --> 20:29.603
No. It's just a nickname.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.231
Okay.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.776
Okay? I'll, um...
I'll talk to you in an hour.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.160
Hey, uh, I never really found out

20:45.160 --> 20:47.204
what kind of novels you write.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.960
Well,

20:53.669 --> 20:57.214
technically, I...
haven't written a novel yet,

20:57.214 --> 20:59.758
but I have a lot of ideas for one.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.094
So,

21:03.053 --> 21:03.971
not a big deal,

21:04.346 --> 21:08.558
but when you accused me
of lying about my job,

21:09.434 --> 21:13.146
being a novelist versus being
someone with ideas for a novel,

21:13.146 --> 21:16.358
- that's a pretty--
- A pretty arbitrary distinction

21:16.358 --> 21:18.026
when you think about it, yes.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.489
I used to work in video games.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.951
- For a tiny independent studio.
- Why'd you stop?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.286
I grew up.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.496
My whole life, I've always been...

21:29.496 --> 21:32.916
the sweet girl... the nice girl.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.585
The person who yelled
at me today didn't seem particularly nice.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.004
Thank you for saying that.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.588
I'm savin' up to buy my own place.

21:38.588 --> 21:39.881
Favorite song?

21:40.173 --> 21:41.300
<i>Brown Eyed Girl.</i>

21:41.300 --> 21:43.385
Uh,

21:44.720 --> 21:47.472
Okay, that was truly embarrassing.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.142
<i>I didn't really love
high school, to be honest.</i>

21:50.892 --> 21:52.311
<i>Hey, you on the phone?</i>

21:52.311 --> 21:53.854
Yes, please hang up.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.896
<i>I'm goin' to bed.</i>

21:55.439 --> 21:56.273
Okay.

21:57.899 --> 21:58.817
Thank you, good night.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.818
<i>Love you, Mig.</i>

22:01.194 --> 22:02.612
Was that your dad?

22:02.612 --> 22:04.239
Did you always wanna be a writer?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.824
I did for a while.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.827
But... then I just kinda gave it up.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.037
How come?

22:10.037 --> 22:12.080
I think I always knew I had

22:12.080 --> 22:14.082
something to say,

22:14.082 --> 22:15.792
but I was

22:16.418 --> 22:19.046
just afraid no one wanted to hear it.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.964
That's sad.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.090
<i>Biggest fear?</i>

22:22.090 --> 22:24.384
I guess that I really

22:25.552 --> 22:29.765
am the person that everyone thinks I am.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.851
<i>What about you?</i>

22:34.561 --> 22:35.562
Um...

22:36.521 --> 22:38.523
the woods.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.776
Spooky woods.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.903
<i>Yeah, I hate that.</i>

22:44.196 --> 22:46.239
<i>And not succeeding.</i>

22:46.531 --> 22:48.158
Not succeeding and...

22:52.371 --> 22:54.581
people just thinking I'm nothing.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.112
- Wait, what?

26:12.112 --> 26:14.030
I put him at a solid 1.9

26:14.030 --> 26:16.825
on my 10-point
potential serial killer index.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.952
-  That's very rare.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.247
You're gonna make a very beautiful
family together.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.332
We're, we're just having breakfast.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.750
He's perfect for you.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.003
He's everything you've ever wanted.

26:28.962 --> 26:32.507
You, you said Ned was perfect.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.385
You, you said Ned
was everything I ever wanted.

26:35.385 --> 26:39.306
Well, that's because we thought
Miguel was a scary, dangerous

26:39.306 --> 26:41.141
banker sort of person.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.893
But he's not... He's broken.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.229
In the best possible way.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.107
He's someone you can take care of.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.610
Someone you can fix.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.322
I came here to fix myself.

26:55.905 --> 26:58.325
But you don't really wanna do that.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.119
That's hard.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.346
Don't... okay?

27:21.890 --> 27:23.308
I know exactly what you're gonna say.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.435
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
- Just enjoying the view.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.854
I don't know who raised her,
but this is just plain rude.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.315
Poor Miguel. Always getting stepped on.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.025
You don't need her.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.444
You don't need anyone. I'm here.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.196
Okay, that's fuckin' creepy.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.906
Can I take your order now?

27:38.198 --> 27:39.366
Um...

27:40.367 --> 27:43.370
uh, no, let's just give it
a few more minutes.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.253
