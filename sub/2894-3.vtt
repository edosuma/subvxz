WEBVTT

00:03.469 --> 00:05.937
Come on, falcon, push it.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.672
You're running out of time.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.808
Iron man: Well,
someone's in a rush.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.443
(yelps) tony?
Hello.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.512
I hate it when you do that.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.981
I know. What's in
the box? A bomb?

00:15.983 --> 00:17.883
Let me jet it into
the exosphere for you.

00:18.951 --> 00:21.086
It's not a bomb.

00:21.088 --> 00:23.188
Rare vaccine for a
plague-stricken village?

00:23.190 --> 00:24.790
No.
Huh.

00:27.493 --> 00:29.795
Well, it must not be
very important then.

00:31.597 --> 00:33.432
Tony!

00:33.434 --> 00:35.801
Evidence that can save
a wrongly condemned man?

00:35.803 --> 00:36.868
No.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.137
Really?

00:39.139 --> 00:41.039
Now, you've got me interested.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.077
Give it back!

00:49.048 --> 00:51.683
Will you quit it?
I'm nervous enough as it is.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.084
(chuckles)
for what?

00:53.086 --> 00:56.455
Move-in day? Sam,
I had your stuff shipped
in hours ago.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.490
The morning briefing.
We're 10 minutes late.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.891
Seriously?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.127
No, I never get
to those things on time.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.129
Takes cap half an hour
just to make coffee.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.697
Huge yawn.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.033
That's you.
I'm new.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.135
(sighs)
do I look calm?

01:10.137 --> 01:12.938
You've got wing-pit stains.
(groans)

01:15.741 --> 01:18.510
Sam, relax.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.911
You're here
for a reason.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.047
Trust me, everyone
is very cool at
these things.

01:22.882 --> 01:24.616
(roaring)

01:26.986 --> 01:28.086
(grunts)

01:30.990 --> 01:32.824
Captain america:
All right, avengers.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.627
Strategically,
the hulk has six options
that we've trained for.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.929
(door opens)

01:37.931 --> 01:39.030
Sorry I'm late.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.767
(sniffs)

01:44.036 --> 01:46.204
What's in the box,
little bird?

01:46.206 --> 01:47.906
(chuckling nervously)

01:47.908 --> 01:49.040
My mom made cookies.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.575
Mmm.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.110
A little embarrassing.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.679
Uh, she didn't
want me to show
up empty-handed.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.282
Keep them coming.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.653
Black widow: Dibs
on that last oatmeal.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.721
Ah!

02:02.723 --> 02:04.289
(grunts)

02:06.926 --> 02:09.026
Whoa!

02:09.029 --> 02:10.996
Hulk: No, come on.
That's mine.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.698
(roaring)

02:13.700 --> 02:15.901
Thor: The son of odin
shall have that cookie!

02:15.903 --> 02:17.269
Hands off!

02:17.271 --> 02:19.170
Let's get you settled
in while they work this out.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.739
(thor laughing)
black widow: Say goodbye.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.173
(grunting)

02:23.142 --> 02:24.109
Avengers!

02:25.811 --> 02:27.178
(grunts)

02:27.180 --> 02:28.780
Who are you?

02:28.782 --> 02:30.215
Falcon. New guy.

02:30.217 --> 02:32.784
We kicked the red skull
and modok's butts together.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.222
Ah, that hawkeye
sense of humor.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.657
Don't quit your day job.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.325
(growls)

02:40.327 --> 02:42.093
Iron man: He's just
pulling your feathers.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.563
Or he woke up
on the wrong side
of the man-cave.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.865
Either way,
ignore him.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.667
Hawkeye:  <i>Tony,</i>
<i>that wasn't me!</i>

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.154 --> 03:10.121
This still doesn't
feel real.

03:10.123 --> 03:13.658
Oh, it'll be very real
once we go through
all of the official stuff.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.727
I'll teach you
the secret handshake.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.662
There's a secret handshake?

03:17.664 --> 03:21.633
Note to self,
"does not get sarcasm."

03:21.635 --> 03:24.603
You're loving every
minute of watching me
geek out, aren't you?

03:24.605 --> 03:25.737
A little.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.838
Here's your quarters.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.641
Home-sweet-home?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.610
This is my room?

03:31.612 --> 03:35.680
But I was working
late in the lab and
I needed space.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.682
So do I.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.051
Unless you know
how to juggle
unstable particles

03:40.053 --> 03:42.153
Without tearing
a hole in the universe,

03:42.155 --> 03:44.122
It's gonna have to wait.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.291
This time I'm not kidding.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.727
So what do I do
if moving in is on hold?

03:49.362 --> 03:50.662
You're an avenger now.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.931
So go on, new kid, mingle.

03:54.066 --> 03:55.700
(growls)

03:57.069 --> 03:58.770
(scoffs)

04:00.406 --> 04:03.375
Maybe I should
move the unstable
particles instead.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.717
<i>Surely you received</i>
<i>the memo that the arc-reactor</i>

04:12.719 --> 04:14.886
<i>Is not for popping</i>
<i>your kettle corn.</i>

04:14.888 --> 04:16.821
I'm here to pop
something else.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.226
<i>No!</i>

04:21.861 --> 04:23.161
(whirring)

04:42.782 --> 04:46.418
More cannot come across
until we secure the portal.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.920
There's one more
than we planned for.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.923
Will the human
impede our progress?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.892
No, he's insignificant.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.428
Distract him until
we can bring over
our brethren.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.064
If he becomes a nuisance,
destroy him.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.138
Thor's room.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.940
So, I just walk in?

05:08.942 --> 05:10.075
He doesn't bite.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.276
He has a hammer.

05:11.278 --> 05:16.781
Um, explanation for being
bigger on the inside
than the outside?

05:16.783 --> 05:19.284
Asgardian inter-dimensional
decorating.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.453
That's all I got
until I figure it out.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.054
I hate it when
I don't know things.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.856
(roaring)

05:27.093 --> 05:30.161
Don't worry, bilgesnipes
love to wrestle.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.496
Especially on earth.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.099
We're gonna see
who else is available.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.267
You just go on with
your viking thing.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.303
I am not a viking!

05:38.305 --> 05:40.071
Hawkeye is always
good for a fight.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.940
Let's see what
he's up to.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.842
(growling)

05:43.844 --> 05:46.344
Falcon, have you
more cookies?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.879
(grunts)

05:49.515 --> 05:51.816
Okay.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.519
Iron man:
Isn't hygiene training
standard at s.H.I.E.L.D?

05:55.755 --> 05:57.155
For a guy with
perfect aim,

05:57.157 --> 05:58.923
He can't hit
a garbage can, can he?

05:58.925 --> 06:00.091
Where is he?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.160
In the lab.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.496
I swear, if he's making
popcorn again...

06:04.498 --> 06:06.131
I gotta go.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.500
Try hulk. He's a great
sparring partner.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.435
Me, spar the hulk?

06:10.437 --> 06:11.469
Now, I know you're kidding.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.505
(muffled grunting)

06:13.507 --> 06:15.240
Thor and hawkeye:
(shouting)  <i>iron man!</i>
<i>Falcon! Look out!</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:20.078
Squashed
by a humongous
green foot.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.546
Not how I thought
I'd go out.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.016
(knocks on door)

06:26.051 --> 06:28.119
Uh, hulk?

06:28.121 --> 06:30.789
Maybe I'll just
go a few rounds
with jarvis.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.357
Like, at chess.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.558
(light humming)

06:33.560 --> 06:35.059
This must be
widow's room.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.361
No way it's hulk's.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.029
Looks like my mom cleaned it.

06:40.966 --> 06:42.867
Why, natasha,

06:42.869 --> 06:45.103
Who knew you were
the glass animal type.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.038
Cute. Huh?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.873
(growls)

06:50.075 --> 06:52.043
To the right.

06:53.379 --> 06:56.114
We don't talk about this...

06:56.116 --> 06:58.449
Ever.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.318
Captain america:
I've been looking for you.
(gasps)

07:00.320 --> 07:02.220
I was about to start
a round of training.
You want in?

07:02.222 --> 07:04.589
With you?
Yes, definitely, now.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.059
Enthusiasm, nice.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.594
How do you like
the tower so far?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.296
Not what I expected.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.533
(hulk roars)

07:16.602 --> 07:18.269
Jarvis, respond.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.538
I didn't program you
to take coffee breaks.

07:24.109 --> 07:26.077
Gentlemen,
did someone call
a meeting

07:26.079 --> 07:28.546
Of the break tony's
stuff committee?

07:28.548 --> 07:31.416
We do not play with
the big boy equipment
in the house of stark.

07:33.352 --> 07:34.419
Hmm.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.622
(whirring)

07:37.624 --> 07:38.623
Oh, boy.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.024
(grunting)

07:42.494 --> 07:43.995
(grunts)

07:45.631 --> 07:47.599
Good.
But don't stay
so focused

07:47.601 --> 07:49.968
On the forward drive that
you forget your flanks.

07:55.574 --> 07:57.609
Would it be totally wrong
to say how surreal this is?

07:57.611 --> 07:59.010
I just want to fit in.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.378
(grunts) but I feel
like any minute

08:00.380 --> 08:02.580
Somebody's gonna say,
"April fools'."
(grunts)

08:09.989 --> 08:12.056
What you're feeling
is totally normal, sam.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.524
But don't worry,

08:13.526 --> 08:16.060
I've studied your bio
and fought at your side.

08:17.296 --> 08:20.365
Truth is...
(grunts)

08:20.367 --> 08:22.567
Phantom captain america:
I don't think
you can cut it.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.669
Thanks, that means the...
Wait. What?

08:25.604 --> 08:27.171
Fly home, birdie.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.040
While you still can.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.341
Cap. I don't...

08:30.343 --> 08:31.576
(grunts)

08:31.578 --> 08:33.177
Ah!

08:37.950 --> 08:39.284
(grunting)

08:45.391 --> 08:48.059
I may be having
first-day jitters,
but that's not cap.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.928
Tony, something
weird is going on.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.629
Tony? Aah!

08:54.133 --> 08:55.566
Black widow, you too?

08:55.568 --> 08:57.101
(grunts)

09:00.606 --> 09:04.475
Great, maybe modok
and skull are up to their
body-swapping tricks?

09:04.477 --> 09:07.478
Heard you wanted to spar.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.347
Someone want to tell me
what's going on here?

09:09.349 --> 09:10.949
Get down!

09:10.951 --> 09:12.016
(grunts)

09:14.420 --> 09:16.988
Stunned face later.
Right now, follow me.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.259
Hurry, we're compromised.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.528
Throw the switches.
We're locking down
the tower.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.563
I was really hoping
this was like a prank

09:25.565 --> 09:27.565
For my first official
day on the job.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.134
The exploding cake
was going to be the prank.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.669
This is an invasion.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.604
(levers beeping)

09:33.606 --> 09:34.973
Exploding what?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.408
Switch your heads-up
display to ultraviolet.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.444
One-nine-eight,
nanometer range.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.146
(computer whirs)
tony!

09:42.148 --> 09:43.448
(grunts)

09:46.518 --> 09:47.652
Hmm.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.988
How does he say it?

09:49.990 --> 09:53.524
Oh, yes. Hulk smash.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.460
(roars)

09:56.695 --> 09:58.563
(hulk roars)

10:05.571 --> 10:06.771
What are these things?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.473
If I knew,
they'd be gone.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.342
(grunts)

10:11.344 --> 10:13.011
Surprise.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.480
(computer beeps)

10:15.482 --> 10:18.182
Don't hold back.
It isn't mind control.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.283
That's some kind of copy.

10:21.453 --> 10:23.321
(grunts)
(hulk yelling)

10:24.656 --> 10:26.290
Like a clone?

10:26.292 --> 10:29.727
Every atom in his body
has been displaced by

10:29.729 --> 10:31.462
An identical packet
of dark energy.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.098
(grunts)

10:34.100 --> 10:36.134
Displaced as in
sent somewhere else?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.368
Where?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.303
(grunts)

10:39.305 --> 10:40.638
(grunts)

10:42.374 --> 10:45.043
You'll learn soon enough.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.244
Now, brother!

10:49.248 --> 10:50.281
Huh?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.250
(yelling)

10:56.355 --> 10:57.655
Falcon: Tony!

10:59.391 --> 11:01.059
Falcon's nothing.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.294
Finish him quickly
so we can bring
the others across.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.130
Others? There are
more of you?

11:07.800 --> 11:09.300
(all grunting)

11:10.369 --> 11:13.171
(screaming)

11:13.173 --> 11:16.641
If that wasn't so unpleasant,
I'd be really impressed.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.143
Mind explaining what's
so impressive about it?

11:19.145 --> 11:21.312
An alien life form
that has no body,

11:21.314 --> 11:23.448
Copies one, and then sends
the original away

11:23.450 --> 11:26.217
Apparently to a dark
matter dimension?

11:26.219 --> 11:28.619
That's pretty elegant
for a parasite.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.189
Some days I'm glad
I'm not a super genius.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.258
I'd rather just be mad
someone hacked into my body.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.229
(roars)

11:38.231 --> 11:40.832
We've been watching
the hostile takeover
from these windows.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.300
Probably how
they studied us.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.368
A small
trans-dimensional rift.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.537
And that, mr. Genius?

11:49.441 --> 11:52.376
That is very bad.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.212
Hulk, do your thing.

11:54.214 --> 12:00.384
Been doing it! (grunting)
they don't smash!

12:00.386 --> 12:02.253
Don't even make
any noise.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.454
(whispering)
uh, you sure?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.189
Because I hear something.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.424
(creatures shrieking)

12:10.896 --> 12:12.396
(grunts)

12:13.699 --> 12:15.333
(pants)

12:15.335 --> 12:16.734
(roars)

12:18.737 --> 12:21.139
Come on.
Come on.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.640
(screams)

12:27.546 --> 12:29.647
(panting)

12:30.849 --> 12:33.618
They're all gone.
It's only me.

12:34.686 --> 12:37.188
(beeps)
all me.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.292
Finances.
Automation.
Finances.

12:41.661 --> 12:46.264
All that money
and you couldn't afford
to give me a bigger room?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.900
(computer beeps)
bingo, surveillance archives.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.236
<i>So I'm poking around</i>
<i>with the fabric</i>
<i>of the universe,</i>

12:52.238 --> 12:53.838
<i>And I've found</i>
<i>this sort of limbo</i>

12:53.840 --> 12:55.573
<i>Where dark matter</i>
<i>seems to pool.</i>

12:55.575 --> 12:57.742
Limbo?
Do not investigate.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.311
Iron man:  <i>I'm going</i>
<i>to investigate.</i>

13:00.313 --> 13:02.747
<i>Jarvis, put all this</i>
<i>junk someplace, will you?</i>

13:02.749 --> 13:04.582
Yeah, my room.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.484
Fast forward.
Display uv spectrum.

13:08.453 --> 13:09.954
He cracked open a door.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.256
Now they want to kick it down
and bring more through.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.457
(hulk roars)
(gasps)

13:14.626 --> 13:16.394
(roars)

13:16.762 --> 13:18.196
(grunts)

13:20.732 --> 13:23.401
For an insignificant human,

13:23.403 --> 13:25.836
You've been quite annoying.

13:25.838 --> 13:28.439
Not annoying,
I'm avenging.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.441
(beeps)

13:31.476 --> 13:32.877
(groans)

13:37.683 --> 13:39.383
In case I actually
survive this,

13:39.385 --> 13:41.352
I don't want the
real hulk to kill me.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.420
(groaning)

13:43.622 --> 13:45.256
(pants)

13:48.327 --> 13:49.727
(gasps)

13:54.433 --> 13:57.268
Your resistance amounts
to less than nothing.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.705
We've absorbed life forms
in countless dimensions.

14:00.707 --> 14:03.574
Phantom captain america:
But we coveted this one
more than any other.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.309
So rich with life,

14:05.311 --> 14:08.279
So many forms
for our brethren
to assimilate.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.414
And the avengers
were the only force
that could have stopped you

14:10.416 --> 14:12.483
So we were the first
to be assimilated.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.953
We're just trying to fit in.
You know how that feels.

14:15.955 --> 14:18.422
Whatever.
We will stop you.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.724
There is no "we."

14:19.726 --> 14:20.992
Huh?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.460
(grunts)

14:28.267 --> 14:30.301
Nice try.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.037
We can mimic organic
and tech materials.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.973
This armor is identical
to the original.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.942
But the guy inside
is just a cheap copy

14:37.944 --> 14:40.878
Who doesn't know
the braking flap override
is right here.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.048
(grunts)

14:47.452 --> 14:49.320
(computer whirs)

15:00.065 --> 15:02.667
He'll bring reinforcements.
Let him.

15:02.669 --> 15:06.437
By the time they come,
we'll need the bodies.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.474
Hawkeye: We got company.
They are ugly.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.448
Repulsors don't
affect them.

15:18.550 --> 15:19.817
(grunts)

15:19.819 --> 15:21.886
But fists do.

15:21.888 --> 15:25.389
Our ethereal bodies
are on the same
vibrational plane as theirs.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.626
(growls) finally,
something I can smash!

15:28.628 --> 15:29.994
(grunts)

15:34.032 --> 15:35.733
(roars)

15:36.868 --> 15:38.969
(shrieking)

15:38.971 --> 15:42.373
Why are they all attacking us?
Didn't we get jumped already?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.508
We can handle
a few space phantoms.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.044
Space phantoms,
seriously, that's
what we're calling them?

15:47.046 --> 15:50.481
"creepy ugly bad dudes"
wasn't a better suggestion,
hawkeye.

15:54.052 --> 15:56.954
I do not care
what they're called,
they will fall.

15:58.423 --> 16:00.691
(grunts)
they're not here for us.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.093
They're here for that.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.665
We've established
the dimensional bridge.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.101
The rest of our brethren
amass on the other side.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.635
What's the delay?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.839
The barrier
is more resilient
than expected.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.007
We need more energy
to punch through.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.543
Did someone say "punch"?

16:24.049 --> 16:25.483
(grunts)

16:27.052 --> 16:29.854
I'm shutting down
your dimensional doggie-door.

16:37.562 --> 16:39.697
(grunts)

16:42.467 --> 16:44.935
Go on, brave little bird.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.539
Shut the portal
and trap your team
in limbo. Forever.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.175
They're alive?
(black widow grunts)

16:54.112 --> 16:57.615
I am not the only one
with weak points, am I?

16:57.617 --> 16:58.783
(grunts)

17:01.653 --> 17:02.787
Sam!

17:04.455 --> 17:06.557
You're hardly even
worth assimilating.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.059
Though I'm sure
someone will take you.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.060
(laughs)

17:15.500 --> 17:17.001
<i>We are free!</i>

17:18.103 --> 17:19.869
Avengers, trouble!

17:22.174 --> 17:23.473
No!

17:27.112 --> 17:29.580
Portal is open, folks.
You know what to do.

17:30.715 --> 17:33.050
(avengers grunting)

17:36.054 --> 17:37.855
(roars)

17:37.857 --> 17:40.491
Stupid purple ghosts!

17:40.493 --> 17:42.993
Avengers, do whatever
you have to.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.996
Keep those things
from entering our world.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.065
Hey, space freaks.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.035
Never underestimate
an avenger!

17:51.037 --> 17:53.103
Insignificant.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.572
Redwing mode.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.006
(engines humming)

18:00.579 --> 18:03.013
(laughs)
toys won't help you.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.248
(grunts)

18:10.055 --> 18:11.822
Ah!

18:14.726 --> 18:17.728
He's using his redwing
to create a vortex.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.063
(all screaming)

18:21.867 --> 18:24.668
He's pulling those
phantom avengers right at us.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.842
(grunts)

18:35.013 --> 18:37.181
Wish I would have
thought of it.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.720
Does this make falcon
officially smarter than you?

18:42.722 --> 18:44.088
Considering he
survived the longest

18:44.090 --> 18:46.156
And got the phantoms
out of the tower?

18:46.158 --> 18:47.925
It's not over yet.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.661
Falcon, what do we need
to know about these guys?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.963
They have your strength,
your equipment.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.132
But they don't
have your skills.

18:56.234 --> 18:58.002
I'll show you skills.

18:58.236 --> 18:59.970
(grunts)

18:59.972 --> 19:01.539
No brains either.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.973
That wasn't very smart,
soldier.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.275
(grunts)

19:07.012 --> 19:09.914
Let's be civil about this.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.116
You do civil.
I'll do angry!

19:12.118 --> 19:14.051
(grunts)

19:14.053 --> 19:16.020
Hulk, a little help?

19:16.588 --> 19:18.055
(grunts)

19:19.958 --> 19:21.125
(yells)

19:24.563 --> 19:26.030
(grunts)

19:28.033 --> 19:31.068
What good is a simple hammer?

19:31.070 --> 19:34.038
Simple hammer.
Complex energy!

19:34.040 --> 19:36.106
(thunder crashes)

19:38.343 --> 19:40.077
Other questions?

19:43.148 --> 19:45.849
(yells)

19:45.851 --> 19:48.252
Ugh. Nice breath!

19:48.254 --> 19:51.121
Stark, energy blasts
work on our doubles.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.990
Oh, that's cool.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.092
I'll figure out
the science later.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.861
For now, badoosh.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.336
Please, tell me my breath
doesn't smell that bad.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.772
I may be a super spy,
but even I'm not
that good a liar.

20:09.107 --> 20:10.240
(grunts)

20:11.977 --> 20:13.777
Think I'm nothing, huh?

20:13.779 --> 20:15.613
Just remember
who put you back here.

20:16.147 --> 20:18.148
(grunts)

20:19.150 --> 20:21.085
We need to shut
this door.

20:21.087 --> 20:24.121
Hulk, quit playing around
and give us some elbow room.

20:24.322 --> 20:26.023
(growls)

20:31.096 --> 20:32.796
Ah!

20:34.933 --> 20:36.800
(creatures shrieking)

20:39.170 --> 20:41.205
Hulk: How's that
for elbow room?

20:41.973 --> 20:43.207
Works for me.

20:44.909 --> 20:47.711
You should do the honors.
Shut it down.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.113
Shut it down?

20:49.115 --> 20:50.781
You're right, blow it up.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.182
Thank you.

20:54.119 --> 20:55.319
(grunts)

20:59.691 --> 21:01.659
(sighs)

21:01.661 --> 21:04.128
That was about
your room, wasn't it?

21:04.130 --> 21:05.763
I'll have the
stuff moved out.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.198
After today,
you're building
me a bigger room.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.768
Off the helipad.
You can afford it.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.969
(chuckles)

21:11.971 --> 21:13.804
Way to rub his nose in it.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.939
Hey, speaking of which...
(sniffs)

21:15.941 --> 21:17.107
Did someone bake cookies?

21:20.278 --> 21:21.712
Careful.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.851
You got phantomed first.
No cookie for you.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.286
I got dibs
on that one.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.822
Boys, step aside.
I'm hungry.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.291
There's no tower
like home.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.460
Thor: Keep your
filthy green hands
off my cookie.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.895
Hulk: Where's my milk?
