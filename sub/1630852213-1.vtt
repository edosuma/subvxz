WEBVTT

00:28.000 --> 00:30.120
HANDLE WITH CARE

00:45.119 --> 00:46.439
Hi there.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.119
I'm here to return it.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.280
-When did you purchase it?
-Six months ago.

00:51.359 --> 00:53.200
It's still under guarantee, right?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.039
Why are you returning it?

00:56.399 --> 00:58.119
It isn't what I expected.

01:13.719 --> 01:15.040
All seems fine.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.680
Sign here, please.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.560
Think he wants to tell you something.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.519
Thanks for everything, Mommy.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.799
No?

02:08.240 --> 02:12.039
PERFECT LIFE

02:14.199 --> 02:17.639
YES, BUT NO THANK YOU

02:48.479 --> 02:49.639
Moni!

02:49.960 --> 02:50.960
Moni, wake up.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.199
-I'm off.
-Just a little bit more.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.919
Moni! Hey!

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Sleepy head!
You'll be late for work.

02:58.319 --> 02:59.840
You'll lose your job.

02:59.919 --> 03:03.599
They can wait half an hour,
I'm tax deductible.

03:04.639 --> 03:07.759
Okay, but I'm going...

03:08.400 --> 03:09.639
...somewhere special.

03:10.319 --> 03:12.840
Right, the first day at the nursery.

03:12.919 --> 03:14.479
-Of course!
-Come here.

03:15.199 --> 03:16.879
-Got everything?
-Yeah.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.759
-The cuddly toy?
-Here.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.639
-Nappy rash cream?
-Yeah.

03:20.719 --> 03:22.000
-Bus pass?
-Yeah.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.000
-Do I get a kiss?
-Sure.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.360
What a photo...

03:50.400 --> 03:51.680
<i>Hello!</i>

03:51.759 --> 03:55.039
<i>Hey, come to dinner tomorrow</i>
<i>so you can meet Julia.</i>

03:55.120 --> 03:57.599
<i>We'll be making a meat fondue.</i>

03:59.560 --> 04:02.400
<i>Nice of you to finally remember us,</i>

04:02.479 --> 04:04.280
<i>but meat fondue doesn't exist.</i>

04:04.879 --> 04:08.039
<i>Damn, well I just bought the pot</i>
<i>to make fondue.</i>

04:08.759 --> 04:11.240
<i>Take it back.</i>
<i>Anyway, I don't know if I'll go.</i>

04:11.960 --> 04:13.639
Hun, I'll eat anything,

04:13.719 --> 04:16.959
we're really looking forward
to meeting Julia.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.160
Bye, thanks.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.759
Mery...
Meat fondue does exist, sweetie.

04:21.160 --> 04:21.959
Whatever.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.639
Four months with this Julia
and not even a photo.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.279
Don't be like that.
Why not call your sis?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.680
Is that why you're calling?

04:28.759 --> 04:31.279
No, how was your first day at nursery?

04:31.680 --> 04:32.879
I'm not going.

04:32.959 --> 04:34.000
<i>How come?</i>

04:34.079 --> 04:37.199
Not interested in happy families
dropping off their kids.

04:37.279 --> 04:39.360
<i>We'll go tomorrow. No big deal.</i>

04:39.439 --> 04:40.720
I've got plenty of time.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.959
-I'll pick you up in 20 minutes.
-No way.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.639
I won't open the door.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.519
Cris...

04:45.920 --> 04:46.439
Cris!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.160
BUS STOP NOT IN SERVICE

05:19.639 --> 05:20.279
Shit!

05:20.360 --> 05:22.399
-What?
-Forgot the nappy rash cream.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.639
-Relax, they'll have it there.
-No, it's special, he has a sensitive bum.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.839
All right...

05:28.319 --> 05:29.680
-Seriously...
-What's he doing?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.279
The guy's unloading his car.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.639
I don't know why we took the car,
it's quicker to walk.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.600
-Move it!
-Hey, cut it out.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.879
Sorry... sorry.

05:38.959 --> 05:41.519
-No, he should apologize.
-He's nearly done.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.560
Hey, Maria.
Maria, please!

05:43.639 --> 05:44.439
Sorry.
Maria!

05:44.519 --> 05:45.800
-What?
-Are you nuts?

05:45.879 --> 05:48.120
-I'm getting out.
-Don't get out.

05:48.199 --> 05:50.079
Where are you going?
Ple...

05:50.160 --> 05:51.759
To hell with it.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.600
You're as good as gold.
Your mommy is unbearable.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.399
No! People work, you know?

06:00.720 --> 06:01.920
Dial it back...

06:03.560 --> 06:04.800
What happened?

06:04.879 --> 06:07.360
-Did you hurt yourself?
-Fucking hell!

06:07.879 --> 06:10.399
-What did you do?
-I really hurt my foot.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.240
Because of that dumbass.

06:12.319 --> 06:13.160
Dumbass!

06:13.240 --> 06:15.439
Let's just calm down.
Belt up.

06:15.519 --> 06:18.600
Nice and slowly.
If you yank it, it won't work.

06:18.959 --> 06:19.879
Great.

06:19.959 --> 06:22.319
-All right. Ready?
-Ready.

06:31.879 --> 06:34.639
I know that you think
this is all a nightmare.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.040
But it gets better in a year, I promise.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.360
You've no idea.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.120
Right, I've no idea...

06:40.199 --> 06:42.319
I gave birth twice, remember.

06:42.399 --> 06:44.240
Yes, but you have Pablo.

06:44.319 --> 06:47.519
Sure. He was never at home
and when he was, we rowed.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.560
I'd like someone to row with.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.639
About nappies, feeding bottles, baths,

06:52.720 --> 06:54.319
nappy rash cream...

06:55.600 --> 06:57.199
And to look at my pussy.

06:57.639 --> 06:58.920
Look at your pussy?

06:59.759 --> 07:03.160
I'm afraid to,
in case it looks like a squashed burger.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.360
Okay, got you...

07:05.759 --> 07:06.639
It's here.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.160
Here? Okay.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.120
Want me to look at your pussy?

07:13.680 --> 07:14.639
You what?

07:14.720 --> 07:17.519
So you'd feel better.
You'd see it's all normal...

07:17.600 --> 07:20.920
-I don't want you to!
-All right, then I won't.

07:21.879 --> 07:22.879
Come on.

07:25.399 --> 07:26.279
Mery...

07:26.360 --> 07:28.279
I'll give a psychologist friend your number.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.319
That again?

07:29.399 --> 07:31.959
You have a bit of postpartum depression.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.519
I'm not going.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.959
It's obvious: bad temper,

07:36.040 --> 07:38.639
you can't sleep,
you can't bond with the baby.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.399
I bond perfectly, okay?

07:40.480 --> 07:41.519
-Okay.
-How are you?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.759
All good, Juanito?
He's fine.

07:43.839 --> 07:44.839
Okay.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.879
Thanks for the lift.

07:46.959 --> 07:49.759
-Have a great day, okay?
-Okay.

07:49.839 --> 07:51.720
You're a great friend.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.040
Hi.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.160
-You're limping. Are you okay?
-I hurt myself. It's fine.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.439
Here he is. I have to run.

08:14.519 --> 08:17.680
-Not staying for adaptation?
-I have to go to work.

08:17.759 --> 08:19.879
But I've got all his stuff here.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.319
Except the rash cream.

08:21.399 --> 08:22.879
We have everything here.

08:23.319 --> 08:24.319
So...

08:26.040 --> 08:28.199
Have fun on your first day.

08:28.279 --> 08:28.920
Juanito...

08:33.120 --> 08:34.000
Well...

08:34.840 --> 08:35.919
There, there.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.960
Juanito...

08:37.039 --> 08:38.720
Thanks. I just...

08:39.200 --> 08:40.480
No worries.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.720
What's up, Juanito?

08:42.799 --> 08:43.960
What's up?

08:44.320 --> 08:45.440
What's up?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.000
No...

08:47.440 --> 08:48.360
No...

08:52.200 --> 08:52.960
Gari...

08:53.039 --> 08:56.399
The bus line is out of service

08:56.480 --> 09:00.559
and I'm waiting here for another one,
then I'll have to change buses.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.120
No need, I dropped him off.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.639
<i>Everything's okay.</i>
<i>We'll go tomorrow, the three of us.</i>

09:06.720 --> 09:09.559
I can take the bus, huh?
It'll be here soon.

09:09.639 --> 09:10.519
I'll make it.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.159
<i>I've already left,</i>
<i>I'm running late for work.</i>

09:13.240 --> 09:15.039
<i>Don't worry, he's fine.</i>

09:15.120 --> 09:16.840
<i>Got to go. Bye.</i>

09:56.279 --> 09:56.960
Hi, honey.

09:57.039 --> 10:00.080
<i>I know we've spoken about it</i>
<i>and planned it, but...</i>

10:01.159 --> 10:02.679
Are you sure about tonight?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.879
But it was your idea, Hun.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.840
We don't have to go because of that.

10:08.279 --> 10:09.200
You don't want to.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.440
Is it Mommy?

10:11.840 --> 10:14.399
Ask her if I can have periods.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.919
Periods are a pain.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.799
Don't tell her that.

10:17.879 --> 10:20.039
-I'm gonna have periods!
-Jesus...

10:20.120 --> 10:22.360
<i>Gotta go, they're acting up.</i>

10:22.440 --> 10:23.480
Pablo...

10:23.879 --> 10:26.159
-We're going.
<i>-Sure, sure. Bye.</i>

10:26.240 --> 10:30.279
Two brackets, three fillings,
one teeth whitening.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.559
-Not a bad comeback, right?
-No.

10:32.639 --> 10:33.960
Not at all.

10:35.039 --> 10:35.919
Just profiles?

10:37.039 --> 10:39.159
-Were you looking?
-Yes, sorry.

10:39.240 --> 10:43.200
-I like swiping, it relaxes me.
-And you never meet up?

10:43.279 --> 10:45.200
No, I had a baby six months ago.

10:45.279 --> 10:46.480
I can't hook up.

10:46.559 --> 10:48.200
Of course you can.

10:48.919 --> 10:50.480
My cousin's friend

10:50.559 --> 10:52.759
was terrified of penetration afterwards

10:52.840 --> 10:55.200
in case her bits had gone south.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.039
Because she didn't obsess,

10:57.120 --> 10:59.759
she found a much wider range
of erotic experiences.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.279
She's really satisfied now.

11:02.799 --> 11:04.000
I don't know...

11:06.559 --> 11:09.840
Nipple play, fingering, pussy eating...

11:09.919 --> 11:10.799
Good stuff.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.320
My pussy...
Haven't looked since giving birth.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.240
-Seriously?
-Yes.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.360
That's not good.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.240
Right.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.840
If you want, we can take a look together
in the toilet.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.320
You're all obsessed with seeing it.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.960
-What's up?
-It really hurts!

11:31.279 --> 11:34.279
You have a small tear
at the base of the fibula.

11:34.879 --> 11:37.879
We're going to put a splint on your foot.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.360
Sorry.

11:40.039 --> 11:40.919
Hello?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.720
Is it 3pm already?

11:43.639 --> 11:46.759
Sorry, I had an accident and I'm in A&E.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.399
Could you wait ten minutes?

11:50.120 --> 11:51.399
Thanks, Claudia.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.039
I have to go to the nursery
to pick up my son.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.120
You can be out in half an hour,
but you can't walk like that.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.080
Can someone do it for you?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Yes, of course.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.039
I'll be right back.

12:11.679 --> 12:14.320
Cris. Are you available
for an urgent favor?

12:14.399 --> 12:17.360
<i>Going into a meeting,</i>
<i>call you in an hour. Bye.</i>

12:17.919 --> 12:19.039
Crap, crap, crap...

12:19.120 --> 12:20.159
<i>Hi, what's up?</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:22.440
Who wants to pick up her nephew?

12:22.519 --> 12:25.320
<i>No, it's not me!</i>
<i>This is my voicemail.</i>

12:25.399 --> 12:26.320
Fuck it, Esther.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.759
Hi, Ricardo.
No, everything is fine. Yes, yes.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.320
I wanted to ask a favor.

12:47.639 --> 12:49.720
You could have asked me.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.000
-And not my dad.
-I know.

12:53.080 --> 12:53.840
Sorry.

12:53.919 --> 12:58.240
You're right, but he has a car and it was
handier, I have a sprained ankle.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.080
So it's because I don't drive?

13:02.279 --> 13:03.960
-What?
-I'm asking...

13:04.480 --> 13:07.919
...if you asked my dad
because I don't have a car?

13:08.000 --> 13:12.039
It's not because you don't have one,
it was handier to go by car.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.759
Okay, I'll get my drivers license
and next time you ask me.

13:16.799 --> 13:18.120
But can you get one?

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
-Yes.
-Okay, okay.

13:19.279 --> 13:21.559
Lots of people like me have one.

13:21.639 --> 13:23.879
-Okay.
-And I'll buy a Citröen.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.960
-Great.
-Great.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.720
Here, Juanito.
Look, this...

13:33.200 --> 13:36.519
...is a present so you remember me
when I'm not around.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.840
Here.

13:37.919 --> 13:40.360
Daddy has to go somewhere now.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.080
But I love you lots, okay?

13:45.559 --> 13:48.879
I'm leaving.
I'll come back another day to bathe him.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.200
<i>Tomorrow is lift off!</i>
<i>Dying for you all to meet Julia.</i>

14:01.279 --> 14:04.840
<i>She's a sweetheart, you'll see.</i>
<i>Love you. Kiss.</i>

14:21.960 --> 14:23.279
Do you like this one?

14:25.720 --> 14:26.519
Yes?

14:27.279 --> 14:28.320
All right then...

14:28.399 --> 14:29.440
Done.

14:29.519 --> 14:30.320
Yes.

14:30.399 --> 14:32.200
And this guy too. Oh!

14:36.840 --> 14:39.200
-I'm so nervous, Hun.
-Me too.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.399
Shall we go in?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.679
Of course.
We're here, let's do it.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.440
Okay, okay.
You look gorgeous.

14:45.519 --> 14:47.840
-You too. Ring the bell.
-Okay.

14:51.639 --> 14:54.759
-It's still not too late to leave.
-Do you want to?

14:55.879 --> 14:57.639
Hi, good evening.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.039
-Hi, how are you?
-Hi.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.440
I'm Begoña, come in.

15:00.960 --> 15:05.840
To enter the contact zone,
underwear or you go naked.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.399
Or we have this option: sarongs.

15:08.759 --> 15:11.240
-Oh...
-They match the décor.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.960
You must feel comfortable.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.240
All right, hope you have fun.

15:28.519 --> 15:30.159
It's nice, isn't it?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.440
I expected it to be sleazier.

15:34.799 --> 15:35.759
It's okay.

15:37.759 --> 15:39.799
-That couple is checking us out.
-Right.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.960
Don't look at them
or they might come over.

15:43.399 --> 15:44.320
Hun...

15:46.440 --> 15:49.600
Kiss me or something, we look all tense.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.320
-Babe...
-What?

16:03.720 --> 16:07.559
I was staring at the couple back there,
they're coming over.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.279
-They're coming over.
-It's okay.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.279
-Here they are.
-Hi.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.000
First-timers?

16:14.799 --> 16:17.440
-That obvious?
-Yes.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.399
We were the same the first time too.

16:21.639 --> 16:23.240
-Right?
-Yes.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.039
-I'm Raúl.
-I'm Cris.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.320
I'm Conchi.

16:28.919 --> 16:30.039
Marcos.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.679
So, what do you do?

16:33.080 --> 16:34.320
I'm an astronomer.

16:34.639 --> 16:35.879
Really?

16:36.440 --> 16:39.679
Does that have to do
with the signs of the zodiac...?

16:39.759 --> 16:41.840
No, no, an astronomer...

16:41.919 --> 16:44.799
-It's to do with the universe.
-Okay.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.120
And you?

16:58.559 --> 16:59.759
What do you do?

17:00.879 --> 17:02.120
I'm a lawyer.

17:03.159 --> 17:04.759
Hey, listen...

17:05.880 --> 17:07.680
Let's have a drink, okay?

17:07.759 --> 17:09.559
We haven't had a drink.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.160
We didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.519
-No, I'm fine, really...
-No, not at all.

17:14.839 --> 17:15.960
No, no...

17:16.039 --> 17:17.799
-See you.
-Take your time.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.880
-No, if...
-We'll be around.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.559
-Yes, I'd really like a drink.
-Okay.

17:25.799 --> 17:27.240
-Hun...
-What?

17:29.599 --> 17:31.400
-Want to go?
-No, babe.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.559
I really would like a drink.

17:33.640 --> 17:37.000
She wasn't actually my type.

17:47.640 --> 17:48.920
There we go!

17:49.559 --> 17:51.400
Okay. Nighty-night.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.160
-Hi.
-Hey.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.200
Edu.

18:07.519 --> 18:10.319
-Maria, right?
-Yeah. I buzzed you in.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.079
-Yeah.
-Come in.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.200
So, yeah...

18:15.400 --> 18:17.640
-How about we go to a bar?
-No, thanks.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.200
I mean,
with my sprained ankle and all...

18:20.279 --> 18:22.319
Plus, we'll be more comfy here.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.960
Come through, it's okay.

18:24.039 --> 18:25.359
-Nice area.
-You think?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.240
-Yeah.
-Thanks, that's nice.

18:27.319 --> 18:31.039
Yeah, you've got supermarkets
and a metro station nearby.

18:31.119 --> 18:33.160
-It's right next door.
-It's great.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.000
I got here in no time at all.

18:35.079 --> 18:36.480
That's nice. I'm glad.

18:37.279 --> 18:38.359
How about some wine?

18:38.440 --> 18:39.880
-Yeah, all right.
-Yeah?

18:39.960 --> 18:42.519
I've got a delicious organic wine.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.880
-Do you need any help?
-No, stay here. Make yourself at home.

18:49.359 --> 18:52.759
-Did you enjoy kissing that girl?
-Are you serious?

18:52.839 --> 18:55.359
Nah, of course not.
I was so nervous.

18:55.799 --> 18:57.880
Be honest, you enjoyed it a little.

18:57.960 --> 19:01.720
I really didn't, love.
Plus, it was weird with you there.

19:01.799 --> 19:03.519
And if I hadn't been?

19:10.240 --> 19:11.480
You were turned on.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.559
I could recognize your horny face
from a mile way.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.400
I liked seeing other women fancying you.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.960
-But I want to stimulate your desire.
-You do stimulate my desire.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.720
But don't you like seeing
other guys fancying me?

19:27.799 --> 19:29.039
Your wife.

19:29.119 --> 19:31.559
Yeah, but imagining it is one thing,

19:31.640 --> 19:32.960
and doing it is another.

19:40.519 --> 19:43.240
Do you want us to sleep with other people?

19:43.599 --> 19:44.759
Do you?

19:47.039 --> 19:48.680
I mean, Cris...

19:48.759 --> 19:52.359
I think that... if one day

19:52.920 --> 19:56.200
we had sex with others, and only sex,

19:56.759 --> 19:58.880
then that would be fine.

19:59.559 --> 20:00.599
But...

20:00.680 --> 20:02.240
...only once...

20:03.559 --> 20:05.160
...no romance...

20:05.240 --> 20:07.160
one wild night and that's it.

20:07.599 --> 20:11.400
-What?
-Yeah. One wild night and that's it.

20:12.039 --> 20:14.880
-You're creating rules.
-Shit, I mean...

20:15.400 --> 20:17.880
If we're gonna do this,
we should have rules.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.160
And from time to time.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.200
Excuse me, can I borrow a pen?

20:23.519 --> 20:24.559
Thanks.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.359
I know what we'll make:

20:28.440 --> 20:29.839
an agreement.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.960
-Agreement?
-Okay?

20:31.039 --> 20:32.119
A sex agreement?

20:33.799 --> 20:35.519
I like that. Sex agreement.

20:36.200 --> 20:40.519
You really do turn me on
when you're in lawyer mode.

20:40.599 --> 20:42.880
-One. Sex only.
-Sex only.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.799
-Okay? Two.
-Two.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.680
-Your turn.
-More sex...

20:47.359 --> 20:48.920
-Two?
-Two...

20:49.000 --> 20:50.319
-Go on.
-Jeez, Cris...

20:50.400 --> 20:52.920
Are we really writing this down?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.319
-We're doing it.
-Okay. Let's do it.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.359
Two...

20:56.720 --> 20:57.880
Always with a condom.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.480
There we go. Goes without saying.

21:00.559 --> 21:04.559
Always. I'll kill you if I find out
you didn't use one.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.200
Three...

21:13.000 --> 21:14.960
See, we're doing just fine here.

21:15.279 --> 21:17.359
-We're doing great.
-Right? Yes.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.400
-No repeat hook-ups. That's cheating.
-Okay.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.519
And don't tell me anything about them.

21:26.839 --> 21:28.720
But I do want you to tell me.

21:41.599 --> 21:43.119
Wait, wait, wait.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.559
It's fine. Keep going.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.079
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.079
No, sorry. I just can't.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.319
-Sorry. Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.720
-Sorry.
-You?

21:56.079 --> 21:57.920
-Is that a baby?
-Yeah.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.759
-My son.
-I see.

22:00.079 --> 22:02.359
-Yeah.
-Has he been here the whole time?

22:02.759 --> 22:05.519
-He let himself in just now.
-Ah, okay.

22:05.599 --> 22:07.119
-Sorry.
-No worries.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.160
-Let's carry on after I sing him to sleep.
-No, no need.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.720
Look, with the baby here
I'm sure I'm in your way.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.079
-No...
-I think I better get going, okay?

22:18.519 --> 22:19.839
I had a great time.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.920
I really did.

22:22.279 --> 22:24.640
Yes, I have to put him to sleep, anyway.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.519
-Shall I see you out?
-No, no.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.640
-Bye.
-Yeah, bye.

-Pauli. Pauli. Give me that.

23:17.279 --> 23:18.240
-Pablo.
-No!

23:18.319 --> 23:19.680
It's for grown-ups only.

23:19.759 --> 23:22.000
-No!
-Give me that. Hey, look!

23:22.359 --> 23:23.960
-There.
-Enough is enough.

23:24.039 --> 23:25.400
-Please.
-No...

23:25.480 --> 23:27.440
Breakfast time.
Put some shoes on.

23:27.519 --> 23:28.799
Okay.

23:30.359 --> 23:31.720
She was reading it, Hun.

23:32.559 --> 23:35.519
-It's not funny. Not funny.
-I know...

23:35.960 --> 23:38.279
So? We're still gonna do it, then?

23:39.440 --> 23:41.759
We wrote our names and signed it...

23:41.839 --> 23:43.799
Then it's official.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.599
I can't find my slippers.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.039
-Where do we keep them?
-I don't know.

23:48.119 --> 23:50.000
-Yes, you know.
-In their place. Let's go.

23:50.079 --> 23:53.359
-Yay! Let's look for the slippers.
-In their place.

23:54.039 --> 23:58.480
<i>We're going on a slipper hunt.</i>

23:59.160 --> 24:01.839
-I'm so happy.
-Why is that?

24:01.920 --> 24:03.839
Because I've saved some money

24:03.920 --> 24:06.200
to pay the 200 euro enrollment fee,

24:06.279 --> 24:10.720
which allows me to take
as many theory classes as I want.

24:10.799 --> 24:13.400
But have you passed
the aptitude test?

24:13.480 --> 24:15.640
No, that comes afterwards.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.200
Once you've passed the theory exam.

24:18.279 --> 24:22.279
-How will you learn from this book?
-By studying.

24:22.359 --> 24:24.440
-And doing loads of mini tests.
-Yeah!

24:24.519 --> 24:27.000
How many do you reckon you have to do?

24:27.079 --> 24:28.839
-A hundred a day.
-No way!.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.279
-Yep.
-Are you going to get a tutor as well?

24:32.599 --> 24:34.960
No, babe. I want to pass by myself.

24:36.519 --> 24:39.480
Where are we gonna go
once you get your licence?

24:39.559 --> 24:41.359
Yeah, where?

24:42.400 --> 24:43.799
-Japan.
-Hey!

24:43.880 --> 24:45.119
Come on!

24:45.759 --> 24:48.599
No, Albacete.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.079
-I like it.
-Perfect!

24:52.119 --> 24:54.400
Meeting strangers at home is risky.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.160
You meet them in hotels.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.599
Exactly, a hotel. It's a public place.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.160
Anyway, fine. I won't do it again.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.039
Come on, sis.

25:04.119 --> 25:07.119
-Why don't you speak to a therapist?
-Because I'm fine.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.680
-Hiya!
-I burned the turkey.

25:12.759 --> 25:14.519
-Gosh.
-You cooked turkey?

25:14.599 --> 25:16.759
-And stuffing.
-Is your girl American?

25:16.839 --> 25:20.759
You must be joking!
She's as Catalan as they come.

25:20.839 --> 25:23.440
What's up, bitches? It's been ages.

25:23.519 --> 25:24.400
Well...

25:25.839 --> 25:27.480
You're always busy.

25:27.559 --> 25:31.119
Hi, sweetie. You're so cute.
I could eat you up! I've missed you.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.000
You should see him more often.

25:33.079 --> 25:36.240
-Your mommy is a pain in the bum, eh?
-It's true.

25:36.319 --> 25:38.799
Nice house, Hun. I love the decorating job.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.279
It's Julia's place. She'll be here soon.

25:41.359 --> 25:42.880
What happened to your foot?

25:42.960 --> 25:44.480
Nothing, I tripped.

25:44.559 --> 25:47.079
-And why are you so made up?
-It's my work make-up.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.400
-I love your green eyeliner.
-London Collection.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.079
Let me know if you want some.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.279
-Okay.
-Babe!

25:54.599 --> 25:57.480
You wouldn't believe
the stuff people throw away.

25:57.559 --> 25:59.240
-It's Julia.
-Hi.

25:59.799 --> 26:01.000
-Hi, how are you? Julia.
-Hi.

26:01.599 --> 26:03.599
-Maria.
-Nice to meet you.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.279
-Esther's sister.
-I'm Cris.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.440
-Nice to meet you.
-Same.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.079
It's Danish, 1950s style.
It was dumped beside a skip.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.720
-So cool.
-You restore furniture?

26:14.079 --> 26:17.079
I'm an eye doctor but that's my hobby.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.039
-Do I get a kiss?
-Yeah.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.359
-We didn't know she worked with eyes.
-But now we do.

26:25.079 --> 26:28.079
So, as I was saying,
once your eyelids are in place

26:28.160 --> 26:31.200
they make an incision
on the front of your eye,

26:31.279 --> 26:34.599
they insert a needle into the cataract

26:34.680 --> 26:37.279
they use ultrasound waves to break it down

26:37.359 --> 26:39.160
and then they put in a new lens.

26:39.240 --> 26:42.200
My cataract queen,
I want to eat your cataract.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.480
Ok, let's cut to the chase.

26:44.559 --> 26:47.359
Where did you meet?
At your practice, right?

26:47.440 --> 26:48.680
Well, yeah.

26:48.759 --> 26:50.480
I started to suspect something

26:50.559 --> 26:53.640
when she kept coming to see me
for vertigo problems.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.720
Babe, you had no bloody idea.

26:55.799 --> 26:58.279
I tried chatting her up,
but it was impossible.

26:58.359 --> 27:00.720
But can you go out with patients?

27:01.119 --> 27:03.400
I'm not her patient anymore.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.680
Love is love, Hun. Enough said.

27:05.759 --> 27:07.599
-Yeah, yeah.
-Here's to love.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.759
-To love.
-And to Julia.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.839
And to Julia.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.240
This wine is delish!

27:13.319 --> 27:16.240
It's from a family-run winery in El Bages.

27:16.319 --> 27:18.400
Shall I get them to send you a case?

27:18.480 --> 27:21.319
I don't see any of your paintings.
Where are they?

27:23.319 --> 27:24.400
Stored away.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.039
Where?

27:26.720 --> 27:28.400
In an attic somewhere.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.079
It's a pity. You could hang them here.

27:31.559 --> 27:32.720
At least one, no?

27:32.799 --> 27:35.359
-Have you seen her paintings?
-Yeah, a few.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.240
They're... lovely.

27:37.839 --> 27:39.960
-Do you like them?
-I do.

27:40.039 --> 27:42.240
-Shall we have dessert?
-Oh, yeah.

27:42.319 --> 27:44.039
I have to get up at 7 tomorrow.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.400
You're getting up early? That's a first.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.359
Yeah, now I'm an early bird. Life, eh?

27:50.440 --> 27:52.279
With all its twists and turns.

27:52.359 --> 27:54.279
So, the wax museum wasn't for you?

27:54.359 --> 27:56.599
I earn more working at the shop.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.000
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

27:58.799 --> 28:00.720
-Yeah.
-Where are her paintings?

28:00.799 --> 28:02.279
Does it matter?

28:02.359 --> 28:03.720
Of course it matters.

28:03.799 --> 28:04.960
Right, let's see.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.680
Wow, with champers.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.000
-What's going on?
-We've got big news.

28:11.079 --> 28:12.119
You're pregnant.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.240
Yeah, triplets, stop messing.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.799
How should I know!

28:15.880 --> 28:17.440
You're tying the knot.

28:18.119 --> 28:18.839
Gosh!

28:22.599 --> 28:24.160
It had to be her who said it.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.880
She's always beating me to it
and not letting me speak.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.519
It was still a surprise.

28:29.599 --> 28:31.599
Congratulations, sweetie.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.160
But when, how... what's going on?

28:34.240 --> 28:38.400
We want a really big wedding.
We don't know where but...

28:38.720 --> 28:41.000
-Probably in the Empordà region.
-Yeah.

28:41.079 --> 28:43.640
But we do know that
the theme is country.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.319
She loves country music.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.799
-Wow!
-I'm a line dancer.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.920
You do stuff. That's awesome.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.640
Maria, what's up?

28:53.279 --> 28:54.200
With me? Nothing.

28:55.599 --> 28:57.759
Why aren't you congratulating us?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.640
I would but I think we need
some glasses first.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.680
We can't toast without glasses.

29:03.759 --> 29:05.480
-She's right...
-No.

29:05.559 --> 29:07.240
-Let her go.
-Where are they?

29:07.319 --> 29:09.920
On the shelf, above the sink.

29:10.000 --> 29:10.839
Okay.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.160
I knew it. I knew it.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.119
-What did you know?
-That you'd react like this.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.319
Like what?

29:20.119 --> 29:21.519
Are you upset about this?

29:22.359 --> 29:25.599
Can't you be a normal sister
and be happy for me?

29:25.680 --> 29:26.880
I'm being helpful

29:26.960 --> 29:29.720
and getting the glasses
so that we can toast.

29:29.799 --> 29:30.599
Say "congrats".

29:31.960 --> 29:34.440
-Say "congrats".
-No need to be aggressive.

29:34.519 --> 29:37.319
-Congratulate us, for fuck's sake!
-Chill out.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.160
So I celebrate you marrying a stranger?

29:40.240 --> 29:41.880
Sorry, no offense to you.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.519
How long has it been? Four, five months?

29:44.599 --> 29:46.480
Anyway, how rude of me.

29:46.799 --> 29:48.240
Congrats to you both.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.240
-What's wrong?
-I'm a dick.

29:50.319 --> 29:52.599
-Sure, congrats!
-Maria, please.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.119
-Here...
-What's wrong?

29:54.200 --> 29:55.599
Mery, Hun, what is it?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.279
-Nothing!
- What's wrong?

29:57.359 --> 30:00.440
Stop fucking asking me what's wrong!
