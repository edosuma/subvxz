WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:04.922
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.005 --> 00:08.425
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.509 --> 00:11.720
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.803 --> 00:14.723
On which we used to rely?

00:14.806 --> 00:18.060
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.143 --> 00:21.605
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.315
All the things
that make us

00:23.398 --> 00:25.108
Laugh 'n' cry

00:25.192 --> 00:29.947
He's a family guy!

00:34.034 --> 00:36.620
All right, boys.
Let's see what we got.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.121
Well, at least
we got somethin'.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.289
(seagull cawing)

00:39.373 --> 00:41.124
Aah! Damn!
Stupid penguins.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.129
Sorry, guys,
but the way things have been goin',

00:46.213 --> 00:47.589
I can't afford to keep you.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.216
I'm gonna have
to put you down.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.426
(wailing)

00:51.510 --> 00:54.680
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.140
(speaking foreign language)

00:57.224 --> 01:00.018
(speaking foreign language)

01:00.102 --> 01:01.728
(continues wailing)

01:02.896 --> 01:04.147
(gun firing)

01:04.231 --> 01:05.899
I love you both.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.986
I'm so sorry.
I'll always love you.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.201
MAN (over TV):
We now return to Gilmore Girls.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.494
Mom, I need to talk to you
about Dean.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.745
Which Dean? Howard Dean,
James Dean or Jimmy Dean.

01:18.829 --> 01:19.997
Ugh, too old, too dead,
and too fattening.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.623
You don't have to tell that
to my thighs.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.166
Can you ask your thighs
if they borrowed my Gap capris?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.960
They did not and they're
insulted that you even asked such a thing.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.087
As insulted as Kitty Kelley
when people accuse her of taking liberties

01:27.171 --> 01:28.172
with her best-selling
tell-alls.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.798
-Almost. Wanna make out?
-Absolutely not.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.134
-Oh, you're so lying.
-I so am.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.845
Oh, honey,
how was your day? Did you catch any fish?

01:34.928 --> 01:37.181
No, but I caught this turtle.
Named him Terence.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.766
Then killed him, and hollowed him out
into an ashtray for Stewie.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.810
Peter, we have a family
to feed.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.896
We all count on you
to provide for us.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.064
(sighing)
I know, and I feel terrible.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.733
I must look like
a bigger loser

01:47.816 --> 01:49.401
than when I was
on that game show.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.237
ANNOUNCER: And now,
back to America's favorite game show,

01:52.321 --> 01:54.281
Bobcat or Bjork.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.450
Okay, Peter.
Listen closely and tell us

01:56.533 --> 01:59.161
if this is a song
by Icelandic vocalist Bjork

01:59.244 --> 02:02.372
or the rantings
of former comedian Bobcat Goldthwait.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.707
Here we go.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.792
(man gibbering)

02:07.336 --> 02:09.046
Oh, Bill,
that's gotta be Bobcat.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.380
(buzzer buzzing)

02:10.464 --> 02:12.549
Oh, sorry,
that was Bjork.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.888
I tell you, fellows,
if I don't find some fish out there soon,

02:17.971 --> 02:19.640
my family's gonna go hungry.

02:19.723 --> 02:23.560
If it's fish you wants,
Pelican's Reef is where you'll find 'em.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.437
I've seen fish there,

02:25.521 --> 02:28.357
more fish than
you could possibly imagine,

02:28.440 --> 02:31.026
fish as far
as the eye can see.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.487
Lots and lots of fish,
I-- I guess--

02:33.570 --> 02:36.907
I guess, would be the main bullet point
of this presentation.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.034
Jeez, where is this
Pelican's Reef?

02:40.244 --> 02:42.454
Thar.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.624
But beware,
no man has ever returned.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.502
Many have gone,
all have been lost.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.088
Vanished,
never to be seen again.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.382
No one has ever come back,
I guess-- I guess

02:53.465 --> 02:57.135
would be the-- the-- the central theme
of what I'm trying to get across here.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.595
Pelican's Reef, huh?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.097
Then, that's where I'll go,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.682
'cause I'm not afraid
of a challenge,

03:01.765 --> 03:04.268
like that time
I outfarted Michael Moore.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.270
-Hi, there.
-How are you doing?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.690
(farting)

03:10.566 --> 03:12.025
(farting)

03:13.277 --> 03:18.323
(farting "Dueling Banjos"
melody)

03:19.575 --> 03:23.912
(farting "Dueling Banjos"
melody in a lower key)

03:25.664 --> 03:29.001
(both farting, harmonizing
"Dueling Banjos" melody)

03:38.051 --> 03:40.095
All right, everybody.
I'll be back in a week.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.097
-Brian, look after the family.
-Aye, aye.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.932
Chris, don't pick your bum.
No promises.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.643
Meg, if you get
intimate with a guy, make him wear this.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.438
Dad, that's a garbage bag.
Don't you mean a condom?

03:49.521 --> 03:51.732
Meg, hefty, hefty, hefty.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.151
Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.112
Honey, be careful.
This Pelican's Reef sounds dangerous.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.031
That's why I built you
a widow's walk, Lois.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.533
So you can watch the sea
until I return.

04:01.617 --> 04:02.910
Go on, try it out.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.328
Peter,
that doesn't look entirely--

04:04.411 --> 04:05.996
Go on!

04:06.079 --> 04:08.624
Peter, I'm really not comfortable
steppin' foot on this--

04:08.707 --> 04:10.667
Lois, I gotta leave
in, like, five minutes.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.753
Is this scotch-tape?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.213
(screaming)

04:14.296 --> 04:16.798
(chuckling)
You drunk.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.429
Boy, I really appreciate
you guys helpin' me out on this.

04:22.513 --> 04:23.805
Peter,
we're your friends.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.891
We're always there
for you in your time of need.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.519
Especially when you
provide the free beer.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.312
(laughing)

04:30.395 --> 04:31.480
Uh...

04:31.563 --> 04:33.982
Hey, hey, I got an idea.
Let's play "I never."

04:34.066 --> 04:37.319
You gotta drink if you did the thing
that the person says they never did.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.654
Oh, I got one.

04:38.737 --> 04:42.074
I never slept with a woman
with the lights on.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.535
I'll go next. Uh...

04:44.618 --> 04:48.163
I never had sex
with Cleveland's wife.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.748
Uh, all right, let's see.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.918
Uh, I never did a chick
in a Logan Airport bathroom.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.340
God, let's see.
What else is there?

04:58.423 --> 04:59.675
Um...

04:59.758 --> 05:02.386
I never gave a reach around
to a spider monkey

05:02.469 --> 05:04.721
while reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.640
Oh, God.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.808
I, uh,

05:07.891 --> 05:10.060
I never picked up
an illegal alien at Home Depot

05:10.143 --> 05:12.813
to take home and choke me,
while I touched myself.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.189
Oh, come on.

05:14.273 --> 05:18.110
Uh, I never did the same thing
but with someone from Jo-Ann Fabrics.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.070
Oh, God, this is ridiculous.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.449
Oh, boy. He's out cold.
Hey, let's write on him.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.034
(giggling)

05:31.081 --> 05:32.374
(thudding)

05:32.457 --> 05:34.585
What the hell is that?

05:35.794 --> 05:39.381
Oh, my God.
There's fish everywhere.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.217
Wow! This must be
Pelican's Reef.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.677
Holy crap! We're rich!

05:43.760 --> 05:44.928
Rich? I'll tell you
what's rich.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.556
The amusing folksy monologues
of young Will Rogers.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.391
But me, I like
the visual slapstick gag.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.560
Like this comically
oversized powder puff.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.395
Makeup. Now, that's rich.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.563
(laughs)

05:54.646 --> 05:56.231
Play me off, Johnny.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.568
(playing fast, lively melody)

06:03.780 --> 06:06.700
In local news, we have more
on the approach of Hurricane RuPaul,

06:06.783 --> 06:08.869
which is working his
or her way up the coast.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.454
Let's go live
to Ollie Williams

06:10.537 --> 06:12.456
with the Black-U-Weather
Report. Ollie?

06:12.539 --> 06:13.665
It's raining sideways!

06:13.749 --> 06:15.292
Sounds rough, Ollie.
Do you have an umbrella?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.502
Had one!
Where is it?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.003
Inside out, two miles away!

06:18.086 --> 06:20.214
-Is there anything we can do for you?
-Bring me some soup!

06:20.297 --> 06:21.340
What kind?
Chunky!

06:21.423 --> 06:22.549
All right, we'll get on that.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.427
Coming up next,
a pig who refuses to eat Jews?

06:25.511 --> 06:26.678
After this.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.390
A hurricane.
Oh, my God! Peter's out there.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.559
Don't worry, Lois.
Peter's good at getting out of trouble.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.936
Just like Kobe Bryant.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.897
We want the truth, Kobe.
Did you rape her?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.899
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

06:38.982 --> 06:40.776
What were
we talkin' about?

06:42.611 --> 06:44.279
That's a hell
of a catch, Peter.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.864
Guys,
this is great.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.575
Not only will I be able to put food
on the table and pay all my bills,

06:48.659 --> 06:51.078
I'll also
be able to finance my Christmas album.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.331
ANNOUNCER: Sessions presents,
A Peter Griffin Christmas.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.625
Featuring
such standards as...

06:56.708 --> 06:59.920
(gibbering to the melody
of "Sleigh Ride")

07:02.214 --> 07:04.758
Everybody, look at the snow
in the yard

07:04.842 --> 07:06.385
And who could forget...

07:06.468 --> 07:09.555
("Little Drummer Boy" melody)
I bought these gifts for you

07:09.638 --> 07:11.890
They're up in my bum

07:11.974 --> 07:13.559
And everyone's favorite...

07:13.642 --> 07:15.811
("Carol of the Bells" melody)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

07:15.894 --> 07:18.021
Look at the bells,
look at the bells

07:18.105 --> 07:21.859
Holy crap, here come Jesus
and he doesn't look too happy

07:21.942 --> 07:24.486
Merry Christmas, everyone.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.864
Here's to fish.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.782
Uh, hey,
could I have one of those?

07:28.866 --> 07:30.534
Hey, Death,
what are you doin' here?

07:30.617 --> 07:33.161
Me? Oh, I'm, uh,
I'm here 'cause of that.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.415
(screaming)

07:39.835 --> 07:43.380
And their vessel was swept
to the bottom of the briny deep,

07:43.463 --> 07:47.384
swallowed whole
by the treacherous, unforgiving sea.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.803
They sank, I guess,
would be the-- the one thing

07:49.887 --> 07:51.722
to take away
from this part of the seminar.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.183
When we come back,
I'll show you how eye contact

07:54.266 --> 07:56.727
can make or break
any business relationship.

07:56.810 --> 08:01.231
(slow, jazz music playing)

08:12.159 --> 08:15.662
It's lucky you packed
so many blow-up dolls,

08:15.746 --> 08:18.498
Qua-- Quag-- Quagmire.

08:18.582 --> 08:19.791
Be careful.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.170
The tiniest prick
will pop these things.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.254
Giggity.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.966
We've been out here for days.
I'm starvin'.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.426
(crunching)

08:29.510 --> 08:30.928
Hey, what's that?
Uh, what?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.596
You're eatin' somethin'.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.766
-You bastard! You have food? I don't know
-what you're talkin' about.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.184
Give me that.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.393
(both grunting)

08:38.477 --> 08:40.646
(screaming)

08:40.729 --> 08:42.814
-Ugh!
-Ow! Ow!

08:42.898 --> 08:45.901
Peter! You've been
eating my legs?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.986
Yeah. See, now this is why
I didn't say anything.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.571
I knew you were gonna
get like this.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.114
What the hell
is wrong with you?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.700
Look, look, Joe, I, Joe--
You've been eating me!

08:53.784 --> 08:55.661
Okay, you know what?
Let's just agree to disagree.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.954
Hey, guys.
There's an island.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.081
PETER:
Holy Crap! Oh, thank God!

08:59.164 --> 09:00.666
(all chattering)

09:00.749 --> 09:02.626
Oh, wow.
I feel like an explorer.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.962
Just like my ancestor,
Ponce De Leon Griffin.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.924
There it is, boys, the Fountain of Youth.
Just like I told you.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.346
Well, that was worth
the eight-year boat ride.

09:16.598 --> 09:20.352
We gather today to remember
those brave Quahog men

09:20.435 --> 09:21.812
who were lost at sea.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.982
The Bible declares,
"an eye for an eye,"

09:25.065 --> 09:28.944
so let us now take our vengeance
on this murderous ocean.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.154
(grunting)

09:31.238 --> 09:33.991
You won't be hurting
anyone anymore.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.451
I just can't believe
he's gone.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.453
Don't worry, Lois.
We'll get through this.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.747
Daddy,
I'm gonna miss you.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.876
(wailing)
Daddy!

09:43.959 --> 09:45.127
Oh, Daddy!

09:45.210 --> 09:47.254
I know, sweetie.
I'm sad, too.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.590
But you're makin' a scene.
All our friends are here.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.889
Ah, screw you, fish.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.391
Oh, I miss you so much.

09:59.474 --> 10:03.937
But I promise, one day
I'll see you again, Captain Caveman.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.900
It feels like
we've been here forever.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.401
Okay, okay, here's one.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.862
What would you guys
rather be? Blind or a midget?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.072
Oh, that's easy. Blind.

10:14.156 --> 10:17.409
It heightens your other senses
to near superhero levels.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.536
Yeah, and every woman I did
would be Cheryl Tiegs.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.913
(chuckles)
All right.

10:20.996 --> 10:21.997
Definitely blind.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.207
Aw, you guys are crazy.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.000
You don't wanna
be a midget?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.502
One of those funny little guys

10:26.585 --> 10:28.712
runnin' around
gettin' in all kinds of shenanigans?

10:28.795 --> 10:31.215
Smokin' a cigar,
while you're ridin' around in a stroller?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.050
Good point.
Never thought of it that way.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.760
They are God's
little punch lines.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.096
Okay, all right.
Here's another one. Black or crippled?

10:41.308 --> 10:42.809
(sighing)
All right, fellas.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.144
We've been out here
for months,

10:44.228 --> 10:45.938
and we all know
that men have certain needs.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.481
And being that there's
no women around,

10:47.564 --> 10:50.150
we're gonna have
to have an orgy.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.779
-Uh, anybody horny?
-No.

10:53.862 --> 10:54.988
No.
No.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.365
Yeah, me neither.

10:56.448 --> 11:00.827
Uh, and whoever's toe that is,
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

11:00.911 --> 11:02.621
but, uh, I think you can stop.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.707
Boy, I'm sure glad
nobody's here to see this.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.209
(ship horn blowing)

11:07.292 --> 11:09.086
MAN (over PA): And if you
look off the left side of the ship,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.921
you'll see a bunch
of homosexuals.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.382
(speaking Spanish)

11:13.465 --> 11:14.550
...fanny bandits.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.302
Well, that was
a great cruise.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.846
Yeah, the buffet
was great.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.722
And I enjoyed
shootin' Skeet.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.267
Don't worry, Mr. Ulrich,
we'll get you to the hospital.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.560
You bastard.

11:24.643 --> 11:29.273
There's nothin' good
about what you do or who you are.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.443
Lois, I'm home.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.362
-(gasps) Peter?
-Daddy.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.030
Dad.
What's your name again?

11:37.114 --> 11:38.323
I wanna say Allen.

11:38.407 --> 11:40.534
Oh, it's so good
to see you guys.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.536
Peter, we'd given up hope.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.289
I can't tell you
how happy I am that you're alive.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.124
Oh, come here, sweetheart.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.710
Wait, Peter.
There's something you should know.

11:49.793 --> 11:54.548
I'm not quite sure
how to tell you this, but I got remarried.

11:54.631 --> 11:55.716
What?

11:55.799 --> 11:58.969
Well, it was a very difficult time,
and he was there for us.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.846
What the hell--
Who was there for you?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.347
Honey, I'm home.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.309
Peter, you're alive!

12:05.392 --> 12:06.518
Brian?

12:06.602 --> 12:09.980
This is just
like that sitcom where there's two dads.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.982
Except nobody's
laughing.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.109
No, wait,
it's the same.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.198
You-- You married Brian?

12:19.281 --> 12:21.408
Peter, remember.
We thought you were dead.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.244
I needed help,
and Brian was there.

12:24.328 --> 12:27.456
He even took a job sellin' cars
to keep the family afloat.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.167
Well, just get a divorce,
and everything will be back to normal.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.794
It's not that easy.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.505
What am I supposed
to tell Brian?

12:34.588 --> 12:37.132
Thanks for savin' our family,
now scram.

12:37.216 --> 12:39.384
And besides,
he's been great with the kids.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.428
I mean, Chris is doing
better in school,

12:41.512 --> 12:45.265
and Meg even went on a date
with the announcer from the Super Friends.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.352
Meanwhile,
under Meg Griffin's bra.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.938
Fine, fine. I can see
I'm not wanted here.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.564
Maybe I'll just
find my own place.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.692
Oh, Peter. I just feel
terrible about this.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.779
I don't need your sympathy.
I don't need anything.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.323
You know what?
Maybe I'll just go take up my old job

13:01.406 --> 13:03.158
as a construction worker
in New York.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.452
Although I never did get
the catcallin' right.

13:05.536 --> 13:06.620
(whistling)

13:06.703 --> 13:07.871
Yeah, baby!

13:07.955 --> 13:09.289
I want a piece of that.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.041
You suck!

13:15.879 --> 13:17.339
Hey, listen, Lois.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.258
You know, I know
your head must be turned upside down

13:19.341 --> 13:20.717
by this whole Peter thing.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.928
So, you know,
if there's anything you wanna talk about--

13:23.011 --> 13:24.721
Oh, don't worry, Brian.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.933
I'll admit this is an emotional time
for me, but you and I are married

13:28.016 --> 13:30.727
and that's the way
it's gonna stay.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.480
So, uh,
any possibility of, uh,

13:33.564 --> 13:36.316
tonight being the night
we finally push the beds together.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.734
Good night, Brian.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.736
Come on.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.613
Jeez,
enough with that already.

13:41.697 --> 13:42.906
You're like a dog
with a bone.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.826
Tell me about it.
I'll be in the basement.

13:45.909 --> 13:46.994
Doin' what?

13:47.077 --> 13:48.453
BRIAN:
What do you think?

13:51.290 --> 13:54.293
Wow, Joe, where'd you
get the new legs?

13:54.376 --> 13:58.005
Transplant. They belonged
to a death row inmate who got the chair.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.716
Unfortunately for me,
he was also a paraplegic.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.676
(sighs)
Guys, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.261
Lois is the only woman
for me.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.598
Well, then, it sounds like you've gotta
find a way to win her back.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.474
Yeah, like-- like
we could get her drunk

14:09.558 --> 14:11.059
and take turns
havin' sex with her.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.061
How would that help me?
Oh, help you?

14:13.145 --> 14:14.229
Oh, oh,
yeah, yeah. Then, no.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.023
No, then, that--
that wouldn't help you.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.233
Well,
Joe is absolutely right.

14:18.317 --> 14:20.402
I just gotta figure out
a way to win Lois back.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.404
I can do that,
I'm a smart guy.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.740
I once built that time machine
out of a DeLorean.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.866
(engine humming)

14:25.949 --> 14:28.452
All right, past.
Here I come.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.959
(screaming)

14:36.043 --> 14:40.797
Wow. Everybody in 1955
was on fire.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.674
I never knew that.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.929
Oh, hello, Lois.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.805
Peter,
what are you doin' here?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.140
And where are your clothes?

14:50.224 --> 14:52.142
Oh, did I forget
my clothes?

14:52.226 --> 14:54.436
Oh, you know,
I'd leave my ass behind

14:54.520 --> 14:56.939
if it wasn't so
perfectly attached to my sternum.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.607
Perhaps I should
cover myself.

15:02.736 --> 15:06.615
Look, Peter, I know what you're trying
to do, but it's not gonna work.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.741
I'm married to Brian.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.410
Oh, that's right.
How inappropriate of me.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.788
Well, I guess,
I should be going.

15:12.871 --> 15:16.792
-Lois, Lois, do you-- do you have a magnet
in your head? -What?

15:16.875 --> 15:19.920
You must,
because it's attracting my buns of steel.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.129
Peter, knock it off.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.923
You knock it off.
You're the one with the magnet.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.925
I'm serious,
knock it o--

15:25.008 --> 15:26.009
(giggling)

15:26.093 --> 15:27.135
Peter, no.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.762
Peter,
for God's sake.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.055
(Peter chuckling)

15:30.138 --> 15:32.641
LOIS: Oh, who am I kiddin'?
I can't fight this anymore.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.143
(both moaning)

15:35.227 --> 15:37.020
LOIS:
I missed you so much.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.148
Lois, I smell whipped cream.
Are you making strawberry shortca--

15:40.983 --> 15:43.819
(screaming)

15:44.987 --> 15:47.614
(Stewie continues screaming)

15:47.698 --> 15:50.075
So it's a shouting match
you want, eh?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.035
Well, game on, Quahog.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.745
(screaming)

15:56.874 --> 15:58.292
I'm beating you!

16:02.504 --> 16:05.716
Hey, Griffin, your sales are
in the toilet. You got problems at home?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.426
No! What-- What would
make you say that?

16:07.509 --> 16:08.969
Eh, ex-husband back
in the picture.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.304
You're workin'
during the day.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.680
They got time
to bump uglies.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.348
That's right,
I said, "bump uglies."

16:13.432 --> 16:15.058
Big whoop.
Wanna fight about it?

16:15.142 --> 16:16.435
Shut up, Patty,
you're crazy.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.313
Lois would never cheat on me.
I trust her completely.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.524
(keypad beeps)

16:22.608 --> 16:23.901
(line ringing)

16:23.984 --> 16:25.319
(telephone ringing)

16:25.402 --> 16:27.112
(Peter and Lois laughing)

16:27.196 --> 16:28.572
(Peter snorting)

16:28.655 --> 16:30.073
(phone ringing)

16:30.157 --> 16:31.200
(line ringing)

16:31.283 --> 16:32.409
Excuse me.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.995
I'm lookin' for a car
that's been tricked out

16:35.078 --> 16:36.872
to look like
an ice cream truck.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.415
Damn it!
I'm-- I'm sorry, what?

16:38.498 --> 16:41.877
You know, with colorful pictures
of ice cream treats.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.589
And it plays a tune
that's fun for the young children.

16:45.672 --> 16:50.093
(vocalizing "The Entertainer")
Da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da

16:50.177 --> 16:54.348
Da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da

16:55.432 --> 16:57.142
(sighs)

16:59.144 --> 17:02.022
-Okay, I'm goin' out.
-Where are you going?

17:02.105 --> 17:04.650
To my, uh, garden club.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.486
It's 10:30 at night,
and you have a saddle.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.030
Well, it's a... I...

17:10.113 --> 17:12.407
Um... (chuckling)

17:12.491 --> 17:14.785
What's this?
(gasps) What's this, Brian, huh?

17:14.868 --> 17:16.870
What's this, huh?
It's a ball.

17:16.954 --> 17:20.040
Oh, is this your ball?
You want it, huh? You want this, huh?

17:20.123 --> 17:22.334
Yes, I would like--
I would like it, please, yes.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.710
Yeah, you want this, huh?
You want the ball?

17:23.794 --> 17:25.712
-Yes, I would like to have it very much.
-You want it, huh?

17:25.796 --> 17:26.797
You want the ball?

17:26.880 --> 17:29.508
-I would enjoy having it, yes.
Give it to me. -Go, get it.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.719
I-- I'm sorry, Lois.
I was mistaken.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.346
I thought you threw
the ball in there,

17:34.429 --> 17:35.889
but I can see now
you still have it.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.015
Go, get the ball.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.687
-I say, are you blind, or just stupid?
-What do you mean?

17:41.770 --> 17:43.981
Perhaps you'd like to see
what Lois and the fat man

17:44.064 --> 17:45.482
have been up to
in your absence.

17:48.318 --> 17:52.656
Hello, MTV. Um, I think I would be perfect
for The Real World,

17:52.739 --> 17:57.244
uh, because I speak my mind
and not everyone likes that.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.412
Uh,

17:58.495 --> 18:00.372
but I'm not afraid
to go there.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.958
And, uh, I can be sexy.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.543
(humming)

18:04.626 --> 18:06.003
Turn around.
Look at my fanny.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.504
Look at my fanny.
Look at my fanny.

18:07.588 --> 18:10.299
-Wow, I can't believe they
didn't take you. -Shut up!

18:10.382 --> 18:11.466
All right,
here it is.

18:11.550 --> 18:13.427
(Peter and Lois giggling)

18:13.510 --> 18:14.845
LOIS:
Oh, Peter.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.138
(Lois giggling)

18:16.221 --> 18:17.639
Oh, Peter.

18:17.723 --> 18:18.849
(Peter exclaiming)

18:18.932 --> 18:20.392
LOIS:
Hang on.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.270
PETER:
Shazzam!

18:23.353 --> 18:26.190
LOIS:
Oh, good for you.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.984
My God.
How could they do this to me?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.073
(tires screech)

18:39.328 --> 18:41.872
( Alfred Hitchcock Presents
theme music plays)

18:44.166 --> 18:46.084
LOIS:
Peter, I can't keep sneakin' around

18:46.168 --> 18:47.252
with you like this.

18:47.336 --> 18:48.754
It-- It's not fair to Brian.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.089
What about me, Lois.
I love you, too.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.843
And-- And the other thing is,
Lois, uh... Hi, he's a dog!

18:54.927 --> 18:57.888
Please. Please don't
make this any harder than it has to be.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.890
You know,
I will always love you,

18:59.973 --> 19:02.100
but I made a commitment
to Brian.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.896
I can never repay him
for what he's done for this family.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.231
I'm sorry, Peter.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.737
All right, Simon,
do your worst.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.989
(beeping)

19:16.073 --> 19:18.575
I find it's easy if I make it
into a little song.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.619
Red, green,
blue, green, blue, blue

19:20.702 --> 19:22.246
Then you put in words.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.832
I like tea and cakes
for tea and cake time

19:26.834 --> 19:28.585
Oh, Brian,
you're still up.

19:28.669 --> 19:29.670
Lois, listen.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.422
Uh, I--
We-- We need to talk.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.842
Oh, my,
I better leave you two alone.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.516
What's the matter, Brian?

19:42.599 --> 19:44.351
I've been thinking
about us.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.437
And, uh...
I just don't think it's working out.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.690
STEWIE:
Oh, my God. No way.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.109
You-- You wanna break up.
Why?

19:52.192 --> 19:55.112
I-- I just don't think
you're the right woman for me.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.155
STEWIE:
Oh, bitch. You got jacked, bitch.

19:57.239 --> 20:00.409
Maybe you should see
if Peter will still take you back.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.286
I'm-- I'm sorry, Lois.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.413
I understand, Brian.

20:04.496 --> 20:08.250
There's no possible way
I can ever thank you enough for this.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.710
You're a good friend.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.336
You're a good
friend too, Lois.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.963
STEWIE:
Oh, that's kind of nice.

20:15.382 --> 20:19.094
-Well, thank God, everything's back
to normal, eh? - I'll say.

20:19.178 --> 20:23.307
And to think, Brian, I was, like,
a day away from havin' sex with you.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.142
I was gonna push
those beds together

20:25.225 --> 20:27.895
and take you around
the freakin' world, Brian.

20:27.978 --> 20:28.979
(chuckles)

20:29.062 --> 20:31.940
But a nice pat on the head
is just as good, huh?

20:32.024 --> 20:33.650
You want your ball?
You want your ball?

20:33.734 --> 20:35.485
No, Lois, I don't want
the ball right now.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.362
-I'll be in the basement.
-Doin' what?

20:37.446 --> 20:38.488
BRIAN:
What do you think?

20:38.572 --> 20:40.741
(laughing)

20:43.076 --> 20:45.996
Okay, somebody's gonna
have to explain that to me.

20:49.124 --> 20:51.752
(theme music playing)
