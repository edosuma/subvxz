NOT THE WAY
I HEARD IT.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.634
COULD'VE SWORN
YOU SAID...

11:16.717 --> 11:18.677
LET'S GO TO THE TAPE.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.012
WHAT I SAID

11:20.096 --> 11:21.347
NONE OF YOU LITTLE DWEEBS
CAN EVER REPEAT IT!

11:21.430 --> 11:24.767
{\an1}I COULD DIG THAT...
FOR A PRICE.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.227
NAME IT!

11:28.521 --> 11:33.109
{\an5}MICROWAVE
GAS STATION
BEAN BURRITO!

11:33.192 --> 11:36.445
{\an5}DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER
THAN THIS!

11:36.529 --> 11:38.280
HERE
IT IS AGAIN!

11:38.364 --> 11:43.327
I guess I never realized
how much I...

11:43.411 --> 11:47.081
I never realized
how much I...

11:47.164 --> 11:48.624
realized...

11:48.707 --> 11:49.708
how much I...

11:49.792 --> 11:50.793
how much I...

12:02.430 --> 12:04.306
WOO-HOO!

12:04.390 --> 12:05.599

12:05.683 --> 12:06.809

12:12.106 --> 12:15.651
{\an5}UH-OH-- I THINK
I JUST FELT
A RAINDROP.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.028
YEP, THAT'S A RAINDROP.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.321
LET'S CALL IT A DAY, YOU GUYS.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.283
{\an4}WHAT ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT,
SAMMY?

12:22.366 --> 12:25.161
{\an4}YOUR HELMET'S
TRIPLE-STRAPPED
AND QUADRUPLE-PADDED.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.830
{\an4}I THINK YOU CAN
LIVE THROUGH A
COUPLE RAINDROPS.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.666
I THOUGHT SQUIDS
LIKE THE WATER.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.667
UH!

12:31.750 --> 12:32.668
WATER, YES.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.963
16-GIGAWATT
LIGHTNING STRIKES, NO.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.132
I'M HEADING TO THE SHACK.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.508

{\an5}DON'T TEMPT
MOTHER NATURE,

12:54.356 --> 12:56.108
I'M NOT EXPLAINING
TO YOUR MOTHER

12:56.192 --> 12:57.651
WHY HER SON IS
A FRENCH FRY.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.653
I'M NOT A FRENCH FRY.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.196

13:16.462 --> 13:18.881
{\an1}GUESS I NEED
MORE PRACTICE.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.925
{\an1}GOOD THING
IT'S SO SLOW.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.260
I CAN PRACTICE
ALL DAY LONG!

13:23.344 --> 13:24.887
THAT'S A GOOD THING?

13:24.970 --> 13:27.389
(<i> thunder crashes</i> )

13:27.473 --> 13:29.558
SAY "ALOHA"
TO ANY CUSTOMERS TODAY.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.562
YOU KNOW,
I FEEL BAD FOR THE KIDS.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.814
THEY ALWAYS GET SO BUMMED OUT
ON STORMY DAYS LIKE THIS.

13:35.898 --> 13:40.027
WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR THEM.

13:40.110 --> 13:40.986
(<i> grunts</i> )

13:41.070 --> 13:43.531
IT'S LIKE CLOCKWORK.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.907
FIRST, THE RAIN COMES

13:44.990 --> 13:47.368
THEN, THE POOR LITTLE
BROTHERS SHOW UP HERE

13:47.451 --> 13:51.747
SOAKING AND SULKING,
JUST LIKE THE LITTLE LOBSTERS.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.082
LOBSTERS?

13:53.165 --> 13:55.000
{\an1}YEAH, LOBSTERS
DON'T LIKE

13:55.084 --> 13:56.085
{\an1}THE STORMY
DAYS, EITHER.

13:56.168 --> 14:00.965
{\an4}THEY ALWAYS COME
IN CLOSE TO SHORE
ON DAYS LIKE THIS.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.591
TITO, YOU'RE A GENIUS!

14:02.675 --> 14:05.719
YOU JUST REALIZING
THIS NOW, BROTHER?

14:05.803 --> 14:07.429
WE CAN SURPRISE
THE KIDS

14:09.682 --> 14:11.267
THAT'LL CHEER

14:11.350 --> 14:14.853
START MELTING

14:32.705 --> 14:35.624
THIS... THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.627
OUCH!

14:38.711 --> 14:39.878
{\an3}OH, OW--

14:39.962 --> 14:41.338
I STEPPED ON
A STUPID FORK.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.549
NOW, YOU KNOW
HOW IT FEELS

14:43.632 --> 14:45.301
{\an1}TO GET BIT

14:49.972 --> 14:53.142
THE KIDS ARE GOING
TO BE BACK ANY TIME NOW.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.728
DON'T GO GIVING

15:18.208 --> 15:21.462
YOU GUYS, TITO IS ATTACKING
RAYMUNDO WITH A BIG COOKING POT!

15:21.545 --> 15:22.379
I HEARD SCREAMS!

15:22.463 --> 15:25.924
{\an1}WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.676
{\an5}EASY, SAMMY,
YOU MUST BE
HALLUCINATING.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.846
EITHER THAT,
OR YOU'RE SEEING THINGS.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.723
YOU GUYS GOT

15:45.694 --> 15:47.863
DAD WOULD NEVER
LOCK UP THIS EARLY--

15:47.946 --> 15:49.698
NO MATTER HOW BAD
THE WEATHER WAS.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.493
(<i> phone rings</i> )

15:52.576 --> 15:53.869
Tito:

15:53.952 --> 15:59.708

HE SAID HE TIED UP RAYMUNDO.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.141
TAKE IT EASY,
SAM.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.893
THAT'S NOT WHAT
TITO MEANT.

16:17.976 --> 16:21.355
NOW, WHERE THE HECK
DID I LEAVE MY KEYS?

16:47.923 --> 16:52.094
OH, WELL... YOU SEE, RAYMUNDO--

16:52.177 --> 16:55.723
HE HAD TO GO TO
A... A SURF CONTEST.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.057
IN THIS STORM?

16:57.141 --> 17:02.730
YEAH, WELL, IT'S...
IT'S AN INDOOR SURF CONTEST.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.606

17:28.714 --> 17:30.591
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

17:30.674 --> 17:33.260
HE'S TAKING THE COOKING POT
TO CHUCK IT IN THE OCEAN.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.305
HE'S GETTING RID
OF THE WEAPON <i> AND</i> THE VICTIM.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.850
OH! TITO'S DISPOSING
