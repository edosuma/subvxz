01:25.017 --> 01:27.584
Episode 10,432:

01:27.619 --> 01:29.186
"Leave It To Cleaver."

01:32.591 --> 01:36.226
Sponsored by delicious Cream of Rye.

01:38.096 --> 01:39.696
Which one's the cat?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.500
Okay.

01:43.535 --> 01:45.836
Hour 14 of our marathon.

01:45.871 --> 01:50.006
Now let's watch Episode 10,433:

01:50.042 --> 01:52.242
"Cat Scratch Cleaver"!

01:52.277 --> 01:54.077
Enough with the cartoons.

01:54.112 --> 01:55.612
You'll rot your brains.

01:59.284 --> 02:00.617
Leave brain alone.

02:00.652 --> 02:04.354
Ugh, I've been watching so much
TV, I can't move my head.

02:04.389 --> 02:06.056
- I'll fix him.
- Careful, Dad!

02:06.091 --> 02:08.758
If I'd have been careful,
I wouldn't have had you.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.026
Ooh!

02:11.062 --> 02:12.395
Eh? Eh?

02:14.266 --> 02:16.266
Now I can't go to school. Or church.

02:16.301 --> 02:18.368
Hallelujah! Ah!

02:18.403 --> 02:20.737
We're going to spend
family time together

02:20.772 --> 02:22.739
without watching TV.

02:22.774 --> 02:23.740
Mom is right.

02:23.775 --> 02:25.876
Americans watch way too much TV.

02:25.911 --> 02:27.711
How many hours? Let me Google that.

02:27.746 --> 02:31.114
Ha! Instead of T-V, I typed T-B.

02:31.149 --> 02:32.916
Let me Google that.

02:34.086 --> 02:36.253
Turn off the devices, pronto!

02:36.288 --> 02:37.621
Pronto. Odd word.

02:37.656 --> 02:39.256
- Let me Google that.
- Mm. Mm.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.224
Hey, I'm doing something educational.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.893
Educational, my foot.

02:42.928 --> 02:44.561
I saw pixels.

02:44.596 --> 02:46.129
It's TunnelCraft.

02:46.164 --> 02:49.299
A simulated world where you
explore, mine resources,

02:49.334 --> 02:52.002
and work with friends to build
replicas of real buildings.

02:52.037 --> 02:53.169
Can you die in it?

02:53.205 --> 02:55.305
- Yes.
- It's a video game.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.340
I got a family activity for ya.

02:57.376 --> 02:59.910
In the Depression, we'd sit
around the wood stove

02:59.945 --> 03:02.479
and sing songs about poverty.

03:02.514 --> 03:04.848
♪ Old poor Joe, the starving boy ♪

03:04.883 --> 03:06.683
♪ Had worms burrow in his feet ♪

03:06.718 --> 03:09.519
♪ He heard there was work in Portland ♪

03:09.555 --> 03:11.454
♪ But sadly he heard wrong ♪

03:11.490 --> 03:14.324
♪ Oh, the railroad bulls, ♪
♪ they rousted him ♪

03:14.359 --> 03:16.426
♪ And stuck him in a sack ♪

03:16.461 --> 03:18.628
♪ They tied him to the train ♪

03:18.664 --> 03:20.864
♪ And pulled him down the track ♪

03:20.899 --> 03:22.465
♪ They threw him off the bridge ♪

03:22.501 --> 03:24.167
♪ And they kicked him ♪
♪ in the head and they... ♪

03:24.202 --> 03:25.335
Enough!

03:25.370 --> 03:26.770
- I know what we're going to do.
- Huh?

03:26.805 --> 03:27.871
- Ah.
- We're going to go out.

03:27.906 --> 03:29.205
We're going to get some books

03:29.241 --> 03:31.041
and we're going to read those books.

03:31.076 --> 03:32.943
This is the very last chance

03:32.978 --> 03:35.645
for this family to get
reading in their lives.

03:35.681 --> 03:37.914
So get on your feet, bubs.

03:39.151 --> 03:41.551
We are taking a walk.

03:43.021 --> 03:44.020
To the library.

03:45.390 --> 03:46.723
Where you'll have to be quiet.

03:48.093 --> 03:50.560
Wait, you're closing?

03:50.596 --> 03:52.629
You wanna read? Start with the sign.
_

03:52.664 --> 03:55.298
Oh, can't we just go
in for five minutes?

03:55.334 --> 03:56.666
Up to you.

03:56.702 --> 03:58.835
But after 2:00, the
silverfish take over.

03:59.871 --> 04:00.837
Ah!

04:00.872 --> 04:02.739
I just wanted to renew my card!

04:07.879 --> 04:11.815
Hmm. DVDs, plush toys, crullers...

04:11.850 --> 04:13.650
I don't see many books.

04:13.685 --> 04:16.386
Yeah, the only actual books
are coffee table books.

04:16.421 --> 04:18.088
Barn Doors of Topeka,

04:18.123 --> 04:19.522
Dogs Eating Ice Cream,

04:19.558 --> 04:21.725
Jigsaw Puzzles with One Piece Missing,

04:21.760 --> 04:23.226
Man-Killing Snakes of the Amazon...

04:23.261 --> 04:26.696
Sir! Never say "Amazon" in a bookstore.

04:26.732 --> 04:28.598
Amazon! Of course!

04:28.634 --> 04:30.600
Alexa!

04:30.636 --> 04:32.335
Order books!

04:32.371 --> 04:33.770
I already did.

04:33.805 --> 04:35.438
Your mind is open to me.

04:35.474 --> 04:36.940
They'll be home before I am.

04:38.977 --> 04:40.777
Ma'am, if you really want to read,

04:40.812 --> 04:42.579
check out our proprietary e-reader:

04:42.614 --> 04:44.180
the Bookaccino "Niche."

04:44.216 --> 04:45.248
Um, excuse me.

04:45.283 --> 04:47.183
That device is poorly designed.

04:47.219 --> 04:48.585
I would register my disgust,

04:48.620 --> 04:50.654
but it corrects with auto praise.

04:51.723 --> 04:53.723
Hmm.

04:53.759 --> 04:54.758
Ugh!

04:56.895 --> 04:59.929
Finally, a bookstore that sells books.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.300
- Oh, oatmeal.
- I love the smell of old books.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.302
Ah...

05:06.338 --> 05:07.370
Wouldn't do that, miss.

05:07.406 --> 05:08.738
The air in here

05:08.774 --> 05:10.273
has a lot of particulate rat droppings.

05:10.308 --> 05:11.274
Ugh!

05:11.309 --> 05:12.409
Okay.

05:12.444 --> 05:13.710
Let's book up and bug out.

05:13.745 --> 05:15.245
Here you go, Bart:

05:15.280 --> 05:16.646
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

05:16.682 --> 05:18.581
Maggie: In Cold Blood.

05:18.617 --> 05:20.950
Lisa: With No Apologies: The
Memoirs of Barry Goldwater.

05:23.321 --> 05:25.555
Lisa, look!

05:25.590 --> 05:29.259
The Princess in the Garden,
by Heloise Hodgeson Burwell.

05:29.294 --> 05:30.326
Hmm.

05:30.362 --> 05:31.995
It's my very favorite book

05:32.030 --> 05:33.463
from when I was a girl.

05:33.498 --> 05:34.798
It's for ages ten and up,

05:34.833 --> 05:36.099
but I think you're ready.

05:36.134 --> 05:37.667
If you think so.

05:42.641 --> 05:43.740
Wait a minute.

05:43.775 --> 05:45.508
One bar... two bars...

05:45.544 --> 05:46.743
five bars.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.311
You're not reading a book.

05:48.346 --> 05:50.680
- You're in a Wi-Fi hotspot!
- Dad, please.

05:50.716 --> 05:52.716
I'm trying to reserve
tickets to TunnelCraft-Con.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.519
What? What the hell is that?

05:56.555 --> 05:58.121
Uh, duh, it's a convention

05:58.156 --> 05:59.522
for kids who play TunnelCraft.

05:59.558 --> 06:01.257
It's got skins, betas, mods...

06:01.293 --> 06:03.426
exclusive access to the top devs.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.595
No convention. And that's almost final.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.764
But I'm dying to go, fatso.

06:07.799 --> 06:10.300
Now it is final!

06:11.636 --> 06:13.369
What do you have for a kid

06:13.405 --> 06:15.205
who wishes his father was dead?

06:15.240 --> 06:17.607
Try this. The Art of War,

06:17.642 --> 06:21.010
written 3,000 years ago
by General Sun Tzu.

06:21.046 --> 06:24.347
Well, there's "war" in the
title and very few pages.

06:24.382 --> 06:26.349
The only flaw is it's a book.

06:26.384 --> 06:30.587
Young man, are you sure you
want war with your father?

06:32.224 --> 06:34.557
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

06:34.593 --> 06:36.493
I do not seek war,

06:36.528 --> 06:38.828
but neither do I turn away.

06:41.433 --> 06:43.299
If you use this book,

06:43.335 --> 06:48.071
your father will lie shattered
before the gates of your palace.

06:50.242 --> 06:52.242
Oh, mighty general!

06:52.277 --> 06:55.211
I beg to be your unworthy footstool.

06:55.247 --> 06:57.647
When he sleeps, I will steal
the jewels from his topknot.

06:59.050 --> 07:02.051
Hey, Mom, I found something to read!

07:02.087 --> 07:03.887
Wonderful!

07:03.922 --> 07:05.855
What a great family day.

07:05.891 --> 07:08.424
And there is only one perfect way

07:08.460 --> 07:11.427
to complete a great family day.

07:11.463 --> 07:12.996
So, how's the family?

07:13.031 --> 07:14.936
I think they went to dinner.
Something nice.

07:23.391 --> 07:25.425
Nelson's coming our way.

07:26.628 --> 07:28.561
My nose is pre-bleeding.

07:28.596 --> 07:31.164
I'm picking on Bart.

07:31.199 --> 07:32.732
You like books, huh?

07:32.767 --> 07:35.268
Well, here's a bookmark.

07:35.303 --> 07:39.806
If your enemy is easily
enraged, irritate him.

07:39.841 --> 07:41.407
I heard you're not
strong, you're just fat.

07:41.443 --> 07:43.075
Fat? Me?

07:43.111 --> 07:45.445
You try eating healthy
at a strip club buffet!

07:45.480 --> 07:46.712
Oh!

07:49.484 --> 07:51.250
Whoa! Willy!

07:51.286 --> 07:52.652
Get me out of here!

07:52.687 --> 07:56.456
It's on fire! Willy!

07:58.493 --> 08:01.527
Hmm. Maybe wisdom isn't
so stupid after all.

08:01.563 --> 08:04.464
Milhouse, I'm gonna use this
book to go to TunnelCraft-Con.

08:04.499 --> 08:06.132
Here's the book I'm reading.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.667
When I finish this,

08:07.702 --> 08:10.536
I'll have read every Mary
Kate and Ashley book.

08:10.572 --> 08:13.406
Sometimes I feel like the third sister.

08:14.742 --> 08:15.708
Ooh.

08:15.743 --> 08:18.010
He opposed the religious right.
_

08:18.046 --> 08:21.481
Okay, this is my favorite book
ever, but no pressure.

08:21.516 --> 08:23.182
You realize saying "no pressure"

08:23.218 --> 08:25.384
puts me under tremendous pressure.

08:25.420 --> 08:28.387
Then let's get started.

08:28.423 --> 08:29.489
"Not all English girls

08:29.524 --> 08:30.890
grow up in England.

08:30.925 --> 08:32.792
Clara grew up in South America

08:32.827 --> 08:35.895
where she was raised
by many native servants.

08:35.929 --> 08:39.866
But they were too naturally
servile to oppose her will."

08:39.900 --> 08:41.734
- Hmm.
- "Naturally" what?

08:43.770 --> 08:44.837
Uncle Juan?

08:44.873 --> 08:47.874
Would you clap as I dance?

08:47.909 --> 08:50.243
Rhythm... rhythm...

08:50.278 --> 08:53.446
Mind the rhythm or you'll feel the lash!

08:53.481 --> 08:56.749
Mom, why'd you stop reading?

08:56.784 --> 08:59.919
It's just a little different
than I remembered.

08:59.954 --> 09:01.220
Let's skip ahead.

09:01.256 --> 09:04.357
A father murdered by loco banana picker,

09:04.392 --> 09:07.260
Clara baptizing savages
without their permission...

09:07.295 --> 09:09.262
Oh, okay, okay, here we go.

09:09.297 --> 09:11.097
Clara is now an orphan

09:11.132 --> 09:14.033
and was sent to live with
her lonely uncle in the hills.

09:14.068 --> 09:15.902
She meets a boy named Conor.

09:15.937 --> 09:19.272
Like all Irish, he was
feeble-witted and drunk.

09:19.307 --> 09:22.708
This is the part you deem acceptable?

09:22.744 --> 09:25.111
The Irish are nobody's joke anymore.

09:25.146 --> 09:27.113
♪ Hoi-dee toi-dee toi-dee toi! ♪

09:27.148 --> 09:30.049
I'm goin' on a hunger strike in here!

09:30.084 --> 09:33.252
So weak. So weak...

09:33.288 --> 09:34.620
Yah-hah!

09:34.656 --> 09:37.256
Another childhood
classic bites the dust.

09:37.292 --> 09:39.025
Is that a coolie hat?

09:39.060 --> 09:41.060
Nighty-night!

09:41.095 --> 09:45.164
I bet my booklight is shining
on something offensive.

09:45.199 --> 09:46.801
Oh...
_

09:46.801 --> 09:48.334
Darn it.

09:49.604 --> 09:52.071
Oh...

09:53.308 --> 09:55.741
Heloise Hodgeson Burwell?

09:55.777 --> 09:57.977
Why did you stop reading my book?

09:58.012 --> 10:00.446
Your daughter is just the kind
of girl I wrote it for...

10:00.481 --> 10:03.449
- obedient, well-fed and white.
- Shh!

10:03.484 --> 10:05.284
Oh, calm yourself, Marge.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.486
Dreams are where it's okay to be racist.

10:07.522 --> 10:09.121
Rudyard Kipling!

10:09.157 --> 10:11.924
Yes. You should read my first
draft of The Jungle Book.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.960
At the end, Mowgli uses his elephants

10:13.995 --> 10:17.730
to stomp out some Hindus
seeking limited voting rights.

10:17.765 --> 10:19.765
All in good fun.

10:21.102 --> 10:23.970
Marge, I suppose you could edit my book

10:24.005 --> 10:25.972
to your daughter's sensibilities.

10:26.007 --> 10:28.507
Wow. An author that wants rewrites.

10:28.543 --> 10:31.377
Well, that's what makes this a dream.

10:31.412 --> 10:33.879
Now the war begins.

10:33.915 --> 10:35.448
Not yet!

10:35.483 --> 10:37.116
I haven't finished my costume.

10:37.151 --> 10:41.487
I'm doing period sewing
with bird bones as needles.

10:45.727 --> 10:47.460
Wait.

10:47.495 --> 10:49.161
Why do you want me to text you

10:49.197 --> 10:51.664
when your father's getting in the car?

10:51.677 --> 10:53.968
_

10:53.968 --> 10:56.135
That's none of your business...
but let's just say

10:56.170 --> 10:58.471
both of us will benefit.

10:58.506 --> 11:00.106
A trombone mute?

11:00.141 --> 11:02.008
But I don't have a trombone.

11:02.043 --> 11:04.110
Open the other box.

11:04.145 --> 11:05.544
Oh, my God!

11:09.756 --> 11:12.428
_

11:18.159 --> 11:20.526
All right, Simpson, blow into this.

11:20.561 --> 11:23.029
Now make it into a rabbit.

11:23.064 --> 11:25.498
All right. Ralphie's birthday is today,

11:25.533 --> 11:27.566
and you're the entertainment.

11:29.971 --> 11:32.171
What's going on? It's like
someone's out to get me.

11:32.206 --> 11:33.906
I have to be focused and careful.

11:33.941 --> 11:37.043
Nothing will break my concen...
Ooh! Wild milk ball.

11:49.190 --> 11:51.657
Bart! You're behind this?

11:51.693 --> 11:55.494
That's right. And it looks like
someone is stuck in the mud.

11:55.530 --> 11:57.630
Help me, boy!

11:57.665 --> 12:01.200
I will save you if you do
what I say from now on...

12:01.235 --> 12:03.969
starting with going to TunnelCraft-Con.

12:04.005 --> 12:05.571
Sure. Just pull me out

12:05.606 --> 12:07.873
by your sneaky little neck!

12:07.909 --> 12:10.142
_

12:11.579 --> 12:13.612
Just be aware that if
something happens to me,

12:13.648 --> 12:16.449
Mom finds out about your
secret stash of Drake's Cakes.

12:16.484 --> 12:17.683
What secret stash?

12:17.719 --> 12:20.886
Pier 18, shipping container
number 4-7-9-5-2.

12:20.922 --> 12:22.722
D'oh!

12:22.757 --> 12:25.891
I was offered a deal and I took it.
Okay, I give.

12:25.927 --> 12:27.727
Louder, dog!

12:27.762 --> 12:29.295
Okay!

12:33.568 --> 12:37.136
Huh. You really think
you can control me?

12:37.171 --> 12:39.105
Malted milk ball.

12:39.140 --> 12:40.740
Ooh!

12:48.348 --> 12:52.392
Okay. Here's a new version

12:52.392 --> 12:56.694
of The Princess in the Garden.

12:57.057 --> 12:59.871
- Mom, you're exhausted.
- It takes a lot of work

12:59.871 --> 13:02.505
to take the spirit and
character out of a book.

13:02.540 --> 13:06.648
But now it's as inoffensive
as a Sunday in Cincinnati.

13:06.648 --> 13:09.149
"Once there was a cisgender
girl named Clara.

13:09.184 --> 13:11.151
She lived in South America,

13:11.186 --> 13:13.286
fighting for wild horse rescue...

13:15.691 --> 13:17.657
and net neutrality."

13:19.194 --> 13:20.827
This new Clara

13:20.863 --> 13:23.163
sounds like she starts
out pretty perfect.

13:23.198 --> 13:24.664
You betcha!

13:24.700 --> 13:26.700
But since she's already evolved,

13:26.735 --> 13:29.669
she doesn't really have an
emotional journey to complete.

13:29.705 --> 13:31.523
- Nope.
- Kind of means there's

13:31.523 --> 13:33.206
no point to the book.

13:33.206 --> 13:35.039
Well, what am I supposed to do?

13:35.074 --> 13:36.574
It's hard to say.

13:36.609 --> 13:38.576
Something that started decades ago

13:38.611 --> 13:40.511
and was applauded and inoffensive,

13:40.546 --> 13:42.513
is now politically incorrect.

13:42.548 --> 13:44.215
What can you do?

13:44.250 --> 13:47.218
Some things will be dealt
with at a later date.

13:47.253 --> 13:48.629
If at all.

13:49.555 --> 13:51.421
Hey, Simpsons. We'll see you in church.

13:51.421 --> 13:52.525
Not today you won't.

13:52.525 --> 13:54.025
Oh. Well, we'll say a prayer for you.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.860
Don't mention my name, weirdo.

13:57.764 --> 13:59.597
Dear Lord, forgive that boy.

13:59.632 --> 14:01.766
He knows not what he says.

14:01.801 --> 14:05.770
What does that weirdo want now?

14:17.942 --> 14:25.425
_

14:30.063 --> 14:31.162
Ow!

14:33.099 --> 14:35.266
My feet hurt. There's too much cosplay,

14:35.301 --> 14:36.734
whatever that is.

14:36.769 --> 14:38.903
- Can we go home?
- Quiet, you.

14:38.938 --> 14:40.271
It's the two greatest
TunnelCraft players

14:40.306 --> 14:41.472
of all time!

14:41.507 --> 14:43.374
Those guys make awesome videos

14:43.409 --> 14:45.509
where they play TunnelCraft together.

14:45.545 --> 14:47.278
Has the world gone mad?

14:47.313 --> 14:50.014
Their banter is legendary.

14:50.049 --> 14:51.082
- Got that?
- Yeah.

14:51.117 --> 14:52.116
- Go left.
- Right.

14:52.151 --> 14:53.918
- Left. Go right.
- Right.

14:53.953 --> 14:54.919
- Dig.
- Dig.

14:54.954 --> 14:55.920
Dig.

14:55.955 --> 14:57.121
- Dig.
- Cool.

14:57.156 --> 14:58.622
That's why they call me Tunnel-Rat.

14:58.658 --> 15:00.257
- I'm Tunnel-Rat.
- Oh, right.

15:00.293 --> 15:02.159
- Oh-ho...
- Oh, awesome!

15:04.230 --> 15:06.097
- What the...?
- Calm down.

15:06.132 --> 15:07.965
It's me, Daniel Radcliffe.

15:08.001 --> 15:10.434
This is how I see
conventions: incognito.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.436
Otherwise the fans envelope me.

15:12.472 --> 15:14.038
Oh, that's ridiculous!

15:14.073 --> 15:15.439
Daniel Radcliffe!

15:15.475 --> 15:17.108
He knows Rupert Grint!

15:17.143 --> 15:18.409
Yes, I do. He's lovely.

15:18.444 --> 15:20.811
Oh! Oh, God! What are you... Aah! Aah!

15:21.814 --> 15:23.347
I loved him.

15:23.383 --> 15:24.949
Please, can we go now?

15:24.984 --> 15:26.917
No! You wait in the poster-signing line.

15:26.953 --> 15:28.919
And don't sign them yourself.

15:28.955 --> 15:30.788
I'll know.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.324
Milhouse, by God,

15:33.359 --> 15:37.261
if you want a ride home, you
tell me what Bart's up to.

15:37.296 --> 15:39.063
Okay. Bart's been using

15:39.098 --> 15:41.265
an ancient Chinese book against you.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.068
I knew it. Except for the
ancient Chinese book part,

15:44.103 --> 15:45.336
I knew it!

15:45.371 --> 15:47.371
_

15:49.446 --> 15:50.819
_

15:50.819 --> 15:52.643
Why are you bringing me here?

15:52.678 --> 15:54.979
These professors have some
very interesting news for you

15:55.014 --> 15:56.847
about Heloise Hodgeson Burwell.

15:56.883 --> 15:58.916
Meanwhile, I'll sit on this chair

15:58.951 --> 16:00.985
and imagine I'm grading papers.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.920
Ah.

16:02.955 --> 16:05.289
Ah, Marge Simpson, the fan of Burwell.

16:05.324 --> 16:07.358
We are all Burwelleans.

16:07.393 --> 16:09.994
You don't mind that her
books are a little...

16:10.029 --> 16:11.862
grandma on the veranda?

16:11.898 --> 16:15.966
Marge, Burwell's whole life was
a protest against conformity.

16:16.002 --> 16:18.469
- Yeah, she never married.
- Had no children.

16:18.504 --> 16:21.172
She lived in Provincetown, Mass...

16:21.207 --> 16:23.441
a-chu-setts.

16:23.476 --> 16:26.777
Heloise Burwell is a lesbian icon!

16:26.813 --> 16:28.846
Her "offensive" stereotypes

16:28.881 --> 16:32.116
were actually a self-consciously
ironic protest

16:32.151 --> 16:34.218
against her own oppression.

16:34.253 --> 16:36.921
How much of that do
you actually believe?

16:36.956 --> 16:38.756
Mmm... most.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.324
So much to take in.

16:40.359 --> 16:42.426
How do you deal with it all?

16:42.462 --> 16:44.295
With the help of sherry.

16:44.330 --> 16:47.498
Yes. Sherry, bring in
the hard liquor, please.

16:51.404 --> 16:54.338
Okay. Now you can ask me
about Lewis Carroll.

16:58.878 --> 17:03.080
Remember: all warfare is deception.

17:03.116 --> 17:04.482
Shut up.

17:04.517 --> 17:06.851
I'm trying to fool my kid.

17:09.422 --> 17:13.390
Bart, son, if you don't mind,
I brought a friend over.

17:13.425 --> 17:14.625
Mm-hmm.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.693
Flanders?!

17:15.728 --> 17:17.494
Great to be here, pal-o-mino.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.230
I brought some potent grass

17:19.265 --> 17:21.397
that'll get this party started.
Bluegrass!

No siree, Bart!

17:36.449 --> 17:38.048
It's me, your Homereeno!

17:38.084 --> 17:39.416
Morning, friend-till-the-end.

17:39.452 --> 17:41.952
Ready to greet the day
with a big ho-hey?

17:41.988 --> 17:45.589
Call me the Pillsbury Doughboy,
'cause I'm ready to roll!

17:45.625 --> 17:47.191
Then let's hi-diddley-go!

17:47.226 --> 17:50.027
If anyone can do it, it's we two-it!

17:50.062 --> 17:52.229
- Yes, indeedle, doddily...
- Okily-dokily, dokily, dokily.

17:55.401 --> 17:58.602
Oh, my God. He's even gone left-handed.

18:00.139 --> 18:02.606
Now we're gonna take you
to a movie rated R

18:02.642 --> 18:04.608
for "really old and boring."

18:06.312 --> 18:09.280
_

18:28.000 --> 18:31.068
Oh, no, he daren't!

18:31.103 --> 18:35.406
Dad, please, isn't there any
way to get the old Homer back?

18:35.441 --> 18:38.309
Well, now, Bartly, why would
you want that balding boob...

18:38.344 --> 18:40.144
Ooh, I said "boob"!

18:40.179 --> 18:41.979
Uh-oh. Time for me to do a turtle.

18:42.014 --> 18:44.148
I'll come out when the
B-bombs stop flying.

18:44.183 --> 18:46.617
Please, I want my dad...
not this horrible creature

18:46.652 --> 18:48.819
from the depths of Heaven you've become.

18:48.854 --> 18:50.521
If you truly surrender,

18:50.556 --> 18:52.990
give me your Halloween candy.

18:53.025 --> 18:54.491
But it's March.

18:54.527 --> 18:56.427
Most of it's still good.

18:56.462 --> 18:57.595
Fine.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.463
Now, bow to your master,

18:59.498 --> 19:01.532
because you are the fool,

19:01.567 --> 19:04.668
and I, the greater fool!

19:04.704 --> 19:06.837
Dad! You read the book, too?

19:06.872 --> 19:09.106
Up to page five.

19:09.141 --> 19:12.176
Now, come here, son,
and grab some belly.

19:12.211 --> 19:13.577
Aw.

19:13.613 --> 19:16.547
Excuse me. These films
are original nitrate prints.

19:16.582 --> 19:20.150
Which means the theater has
just gone up in a terrible fire.

19:20.186 --> 19:21.719
You have seconds to escape!

19:24.724 --> 19:27.521
They never tell the organist.

19:44.081 --> 19:46.882
Hmm, so that film is
a hundred years old?

19:46.917 --> 19:49.985
No. We shot it at my place yesterday.
