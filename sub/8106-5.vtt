WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.087
Here you go.

00:07.925 --> 00:11.803
That fried crap
will kill you. See?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.059
Good night.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.062
Time to make the donuts.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.401
- Hands in the air! Right now!
- Get them up!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.903
Move out here. Get up!
Move out here! Let's go!

00:29.029 --> 00:30.196
- Move it.
- Put them up!

00:30.322 --> 00:32.198
Purses and wallets
on the counter, right now.

00:32.324 --> 00:35.243
Yo! Your watches, your jewelry!
Take it all off!

00:38.539 --> 00:40.623
- Yeah, all right.
- Keep the girl. Keep the girl.

00:41.166 --> 00:41.999
Yeah.

00:42.126 --> 00:43.710
We're moving to
the back room. Let's go!

00:43.836 --> 00:45.670
- Go! Let's go!
- Move it!

00:45.796 --> 00:47.797
Go on! Not you.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.132
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.883
She's staying right here.

00:51.009 --> 00:51.843
You're not going to do this.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.511
Whoa, whoa, kid.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.809
No, Jeremy. Please, just do
what they say. Please!

00:59.935 --> 01:02.103
Okay. Okay.
Yeah. Move!

01:12.948 --> 01:13.948
Son of a bitch!

01:14.074 --> 01:17.410
You thought I was
going to let you hurt my wife?

01:17.745 --> 01:20.037
Hey! Hey, sir. Your wife!

01:21.331 --> 01:22.749
What did he do to her?

01:22.875 --> 01:23.916
Nothing.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.008
Tracy!

02:09.046 --> 02:11.005
Twenty-year-old married
African-American female.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.466
Couldn't breathe.
Anaphylaxis-like throat swelling.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.218
- Children?
- You think pregnancy would explain...

02:15.344 --> 02:16.385
Explains the marriage.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.887
Who the hell
gets married at 20?

02:18.013 --> 02:19.347
I'm guessing,
people in love?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.516
Show me a 20-year-old
who's not in love.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.517
You get married at 20,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.727
you're going to be shocked
at who you're living with at 30.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.771
It's not allergies.
Negative on the skin test.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.898
Four days of antihistamines
and steroids.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.316
- Who's he talking to?
- What?

02:30.442 --> 02:33.528
It's got an ass.
Technically, that makes it a "who."

02:34.738 --> 02:37.198
New nurse in pedes.
Wendy something.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.866
Swelling just started
to go down...

02:38.992 --> 02:40.243
You seen her here before?

02:40.369 --> 02:44.539
A couple times. I tried following
her home, but she gave me the slip.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.415
Swelling's...

02:51.004 --> 02:52.672
You think that's funny?

02:52.798 --> 02:55.842
Ask him about the time
he sabotaged my cane.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.469
Are you serious?

02:58.846 --> 03:01.472
There was a point to it.
Wendy, this is House.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.977
Something about not getting too uppity
with normal folks who walk good.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.565
You're everything I'd heard.
Nice to meet you.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.696
Why so rude?

03:16.822 --> 03:19.407
You've sprinted through
three bad marriages

03:19.533 --> 03:22.702
into an affair with a dying patient.
Now a naughty nurse?

03:22.828 --> 03:25.454
How many more failed relationships are
we both gonna have to deal with

03:25.581 --> 03:27.206
before you learn to
love yourself?

03:27.332 --> 03:28.624
And I mean that
in the literal way.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.877
It's amazing how you can not only know
it's a relationship,

03:31.003 --> 03:36.132
but that it's a bad relationship,
based on nothing but nothing.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.592
I know you.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.677
I'm not with her,
not even trying.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.973
You're lying to me.
That's interesting.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.392
Well, as long as
it's interesting.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.565
- Swelling is...
- Why is she hanging out here?

03:52.691 --> 03:54.233
Anyone interested in what happened
with the swelling?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.319
She's in pedes.
That's the next wing over.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.446
If you're wondering
if Wilson's dating her, ask Wilson.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.490
Clearly he did, and Wilson denied it.
And House doesn't believe it.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.827
That's gotta hurt. That's why it pays
to have more than one friend, House.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.871
If he's not hitting that,
why is she here?

04:06.997 --> 04:10.124
Because I'm hitting that
and it's totally hot.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.001
Swelling took four days
to resolve.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.086
Patient has unexplained
intense abdominal pains.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.880
So explain them.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.132
Wake me when they've done
an exploratory laparotomy.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.967
Anybody know her?
Know her story?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.594
Up and at 'em.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.845
They did a laparotomy.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.723
Liver, bowel, gall bladder,
appendix, all clean.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.600
Belly pain plus
throat swelling.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.354
She was in some sort of assault, right?
Simple neck trauma.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.981
It says no one touched her neck, and if
they did, it would resolve by now.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.900
Didn't need to touch her.
Some guy coughed on her, right?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.902
He's in jail and
he's completely healthy,

04:38.028 --> 04:41.238
except for the broken head
he got from the beating he took.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.532
There's pot on her tox screen.

04:43.659 --> 04:46.243
Salmonella from the pot
would explain the stomach pains.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.037
It's a stretch.
She'd have a fever.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.748
She's on steroids for the swelling,
therefore no fever.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.291
And the smoking
explains the throat.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.293
Sorry, take it back.
That's a stretch.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.128
Got a better idea?

04:57.339 --> 04:58.965
Then stretch away.

04:59.091 --> 05:02.176
Start her on fluoroquinolone
for the salmonella.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.479
I was waiting
two hours out there.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.022
Fascinating.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.067
Have you considered a career
as a memoirist?

05:18.193 --> 05:19.360
Let's see it.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.738
You don't introduce yourself?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.323
Sorry, I thought
you were waiting two hours.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.992
Didn't know
you wanted to chat.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.953
Hi, I'm Greg.
How about that local sports team?

05:32.416 --> 05:34.166
It's not an infection.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.126
How can you tell without...

05:35.252 --> 05:36.419
You want me to touch you?

05:36.545 --> 05:38.587
It's your private place.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.923
You're chewing nicotine gum,
which causes dehydration,

05:41.049 --> 05:42.758
which causes wear
and tear.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.886
Try a lubricant,
or foreplay if you're cheap.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.180
Just take a swab
and get it tested, okay?

05:48.306 --> 05:53.269
Sorry, I already met this month's quota
of useless tests for stubborn idiots.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.898
You're rude.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.318
Wow. You're like a
detective or something.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.530
And you're smart
and you're funny.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.325
But you are bitter
and you're lonely,

06:08.952 --> 06:13.080
so you treat everyone around
like they're idiots,

06:13.457 --> 06:17.209
and you get away with it
'cause of your cane.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.839
Please stop. It's hard to
write through the haze of bitter tears.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.175
But you're not actually
getting away with it.

06:24.301 --> 06:29.221
Last nurse you made fun of, she probably
slipped some crap into your coffee.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.725
Yeah, I asked for
decrapinated coffee.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.818
Treat people like jerks,
you get treated like a jerk.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.383
Thank you.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.677
Bend over.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.515
- You kidding me?
- If you have an infection,

07:12.641 --> 07:14.058
you'd have a fever.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.601
But you're chewing
nicotine gum,

07:15.727 --> 07:17.103
which messes with the weather
in your mouth,

07:17.229 --> 07:19.772
so I need to
vacation elsewhere.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.411
And wait till I put
the thermometer in.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.873
You break it, you bought it.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.798
Leaving early today.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.804
Do you ever get that thing
where you're sure you forgot something,

07:51.930 --> 07:54.306
but you can't figure out what?

07:54.933 --> 07:57.643
Guess it can't be
that important.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.772
Salmonella is a bacterial infection
that you can get from pot plants.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.149
It causes stomach pain.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.108
And my throat?

08:04.234 --> 08:07.153
The thinking is it's
an inflammatory reaction to the smoking.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.738
How much would you need to smoke
for your throat to go nuts like that?

08:09.865 --> 08:11.240
Most cases, a lot.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.658
We don't smoke a lot.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.410
Let's just start
the treatment.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.328
You think we're liars,
as well as druggies?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.789
Actually, I'm wondering if you'd mind
getting her a cup of ice chips.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.749
You're not gonna get
any different answer from her.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.127
No, no. He can stay.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.297
No offense, but this place is scary.
I feel better when he's around.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.506
Tracy, I need to talk to you.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.466
We don't do a lot of drugs.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.052
I need to know
your answers aren't being pressured.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.182
Look, if you think the antibiotics are a
good idea, you can give them to me.

08:36.308 --> 08:40.811
Okay. Worst-case scenario,
it'll help us rule out a few things.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.688
He's a good guy.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.899
He just has a hard time
holding in his emotions.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.567
You don't have to
apologize for me.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.444
That mean you're
going to do it for yourself?

08:48.570 --> 08:50.487
I got nothing to
apologize for.

08:50.614 --> 08:51.572
He's young.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.200
Itchy.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.996
Allergic reaction
to the fluoroquinolone.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.706
We should switch to
a different antibiotic.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.707
Why?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.459
We can't treat the salmonella unless...

09:03.585 --> 09:05.836
Salmonella? That was a total stretch.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.755
Oh, man, why does that
sound so familiar?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.298
You think it's 'cause
I said it an hour ago?

09:09.424 --> 09:12.384
Then it was a dumb thing
to say. Now it's smart.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.720
She's got the rash, so we know
she's unusually susceptible

09:14.846 --> 09:17.389
to allergic reactions,
so that's what brought her in.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.016
Probably the peanut butter
in her sandwich.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.476
Stick test was negative
for peanuts.

09:20.602 --> 09:23.187
That's because you foolishly tested her
while she was lying down.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.398
- Exercise-based anaphylaxis?
- I think that requires exercise.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.150
When her throat closed,
they'd just got done eating.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.276
Not even competitive eating.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.863
And getting robbed.
That always gets my heart rate up.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.448
Give her the same food
she ate at the diner

09:34.574 --> 09:35.407
and stick her
on the treadmill.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.953
Better yet, put a gun to her head,
threaten to rape her.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.579
You don't think
I'm going to get a response?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.164
No.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.749
You're on. Fifty bucks.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.167
I'm not betting
on a patient's...

09:45.293 --> 09:48.003
A hundred bucks.
If you say so.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.389
Tracy, I'm increasing
the speed a little.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.683
My stomach really hurts.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.312
Jeremy, you out there?
Talk to... Talk...

10:05.438 --> 10:07.856
You're doing great.
Isn't this enough?

10:07.983 --> 10:09.942
We're not getting
any allergic response yet.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.402
Shut it off.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.486
We don't complete the test,

10:12.612 --> 10:13.862
my boss will just come down here
and do it himself.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.364
You do not want that.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.408
She's in pain. Look at her.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.909
I don't want to have to
ask you to leave.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.370
You're gonna ask me to leave?
Are you kidding me? This is my wife!

10:21.496 --> 10:23.539
You guys aren't helping her.
You're just hurting her. What?

10:23.665 --> 10:26.292
You guys have all this equipment here,
and you're not doing anything!

10:26.418 --> 10:27.918
You guys can't even
figure out what's...

10:29.754 --> 10:30.879
God, it hurts.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.841
- Where?
- In my stomach. And my chest.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.762
- Oh, God!
- It's Foreman. Get me a wheelchair.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.269
He's as sick as
she is now.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.562
I told you it wouldn't work.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.063
It worked on
the wrong patient.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.899
We could spend all day
arguing right or wrong.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.026
Give me the 100 bucks.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.402
We didn't bet.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.238
We could spend all day
arguing whether we bet or not.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.407
Give me the 100 bucks.

10:58.533 --> 11:03.454
Come on, Foreman, pay up. He won.
Or we could just never finish the DDX.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.835
Husband's test showed no MI, no
aortic dissection. It's not his heart.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.463
It's just nonspecific
chest and abdominal pain.

11:12.589 --> 11:17.051
So, psychosomatic?
Panic attack?

11:17.260 --> 11:20.429
Pain persisted after
he got lorazepam and morphine.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.306
Whose locker is that?

11:22.432 --> 11:23.640
Mine.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.518
Chest, stomach, throat.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.396
- What does it all mean?
- We're in the nurses' locker room.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.023
I know that.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.694
Oh, that is so annoying.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.947
Wilson's girlfriend's
left her stuff in my locker again.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.867
Great. I hadn't committed
any felonies yet today.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.660
Relax. You know who
they're going to blame.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.121
House, you want to mess
with Wilson, no problem.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.706
But you got no reason
to screw around with...

11:47.832 --> 11:48.874
Can we get back to the medicine?

11:49.000 --> 11:49.917
Okay.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.753
Why assume one disease?
His chest, her throat.

11:52.879 --> 11:56.131
So it's just a coincidence that they've
both got crippling stomach pains?

11:56.257 --> 11:59.468
Wow, they really are a great couple.
So much in common.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.055
One blue shoe.
What do you think that means?

12:03.181 --> 12:06.183
It means you're insane.
Wilson's not dating her.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.309
You feeling luckier?

12:07.435 --> 12:08.769
It doesn't matter
what I answer.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.145
Two hundred it is.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.982
If they're married and caught
the same disease, then it means they...

12:15.318 --> 12:18.695
Brochure to a jazz festival
in the Poconos this weekend.

12:18.822 --> 12:22.032
Wilson likes jazz.
Foreman, pay the man.

12:22.158 --> 12:26.578
Four, five, six novels, no music.
What does that mean?

12:26.704 --> 12:27.746
She's literate.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.499
It means she spends
her leisure time reading, not listening.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.877
She'd only want to go and watch jazz
if the other person wanted to go.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.172
She has a martyr complex,
issues of inferiority.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.882
Married couple, same disease.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.427
They either got it from each other
or in the same place.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.679
Infectious or environmental?

12:43.930 --> 12:47.516
What we have to do is check out
parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi,

12:47.642 --> 12:52.104
prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals.
Or it's Internet porn-related.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.649
I'll check the Internet.
You guys cover the rest of the stuff.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.574
If they can live here without killing
each other, they must really be in love.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.159
It's tiny.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.078
How come it's taking you
so long to search it?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.249
Box of condoms in his jacket.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.959
I know you're poor now,
but buy your own.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.919
She's on the pill.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.172
Why would he need condoms?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.757
No, no, no. Put that back.

13:20.884 --> 13:21.842
Why?

13:21.968 --> 13:24.553
We show that to House, he'll just
call the guy a cheating bastard.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.804
Look how he is with Wilson.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.015
He'd be right.
Could be an STD.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.643
One that doesn't give them
any symptoms in their sexual organs?

13:31.769 --> 13:34.313
- They never mentioned anything.
- Maybe they're embarrassed.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.439
What else could it be?

13:35.565 --> 13:38.484
You think they just like the sexy feel
of latex against their genitals?

13:38.610 --> 13:41.945
Maybe the wife
just wants to be extra-cautious.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.780
- Come on. You really believe that?
- Yeah.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.784
Good. Then I'm sure
you'll have no problem convincing House.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.164
That cheating bastard!

13:52.290 --> 13:53.624
He loves her.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.960
Right, I bet he told you
that she's the love of his life.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.754
People lie. I get it.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.466
But they don't go up against two armed
gunmen to save someone unless they...

14:02.592 --> 14:07.804
There's a reason that we don't let kids
vote or drink or work in salt mines.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.598
They're idiots.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.767
Twenty-year-olds
fall in and out of love more often

14:11.893 --> 14:14.102
than they change their oil filters,

14:14.229 --> 14:15.354
which they should do
more often.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.648
Sorry. Ridiculous of me
to draw a conclusion

14:17.774 --> 14:19.816
based on actually
observing them.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.444
I should have just depended on
your misanthropic view of human nature.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.530
Gonorrhea explains
all their symptoms.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.740
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome
for her belly pain,

14:26.866 --> 14:29.868
costochondritis and bladder infection
for his chest and abdominal pain.

14:29.994 --> 14:30.869
Good.

14:30.995 --> 14:35.415
Now go rub their lying,
cheating privates with a cotton swab.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.047
Why would you want to
look at our...

14:42.173 --> 14:44.925
Is this because
of the condoms?

14:45.051 --> 14:48.470
You found them in his jacket,
figured he was hiding something from me.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.390
I thought I was pregnant last month.
It kind of freaked me out.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.767
I'm way too young
to have kids.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.019
So you just wanted
to be extra-cautious?

14:56.145 --> 14:59.481
Wish one of us had figured that out,
stuck to his guns.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.732
We've still gotta
check you both.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.734
She's the only girlfriend
I've ever had.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.319
- She's the love of...
- Please don't say it.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.696
I can't say I love my wife?

15:05.822 --> 15:06.863
We're still going to test you.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.323
What is it? I'm white?

15:08.449 --> 15:09.866
Yeah, that's it.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.786
Jer, I wish you would stop it.
You're really embarrassing.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.664
Everybody thinks they're so liberal,
but I see how they look at us.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.250
White and black,
especially black.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.086
I'm sorry, Trace,
but it's true.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.171
Great. Prove us all wrong.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.592
Stupid...

15:26.718 --> 15:29.845
No scarring, no purulent discharge,
and the NAATs were negative.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.972
- They don't have an STD.
- What's that you say?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.308
You've got a problem
with interracial couples?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.809
Thank you, Chase. No!

15:35.935 --> 15:37.686
Have any of your shorties
ever been whities?

15:37.812 --> 15:40.856
I'm not sure I understand
your ghetto slang, Dr. House.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.858
How many black women
have you dated, by the way?

15:42.984 --> 15:47.112
I don't care about color, as long as
they can help me breed a superior race.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.657
Yeah, my exes have usually
been black. So what?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.869
It's not a racial thing. It's cultural.
I have more in common with them.

15:53.995 --> 15:57.581
Like I assume you only date
emotionally stunted bigots.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.002
Sorry, you're right.
That kind of prejudice is totally fine.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.464
The abdominal pain's getting worse.
We've had to up their morphine twice.

16:05.590 --> 16:06.798
Take the wife off
the steroids.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.550
She spikes a fever,
we'll know it's an infection.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.053
She doesn't,
it's environmental.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.188
He got off easy.
I almost gave him a colonoscopy.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.732
That was one of the stupidest things
you have ever done,

16:23.858 --> 16:26.151
and there is heavy
competition for...

16:26.277 --> 16:27.694
What are you doing?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.946
You only ate
half your breakfast.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.907
Feeling a little sick
this morning?

16:32.033 --> 16:34.076
I'm not pregnant.
They burnt my omelet.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.577
You need to apologize
to this guy.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.162
I am a man of principle.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.165
I don't care how much time and money
it costs you to defend me.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.333
He wants to kill you.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.878
No empty coffee cups.
Off the caffeine. Good for baby.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.131
Cups are in the other wastebasket.
Baby's in your mind.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.592
You can berate patients
all you want.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.096
Shoving objects into
their rectums is assault.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.056
Pay attention to me.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.267
Sorry, that would make
it harder to ignore you.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.604
Can't ignore that rapidly
expanding first-trimester ass, though.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.273
Sometimes an ass
is just an ass.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.946
You are not always right, House.
Apologize to the guy.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.921
- What are you doing here?
- Stay away from my son.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.006
How did you find us?

17:31.217 --> 17:32.884
Stay away from that girl.

17:37.265 --> 17:41.268
Please! Please! Please!
You leave him alone!

17:41.394 --> 17:43.353
- What happened?
- She's dreaming. She started yelling.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.064
- You're breaking Jeremy's arm. Please!
- No one's hurting him.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.484
Baby, it's me. It's Jeremy.
Tracy, Tracy.

17:50.486 --> 17:55.365
She's okay. Baby, it was just
a bad dream. Everything's okay.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.744
Tracy. Tracy?

18:09.255 --> 18:10.547
It was an acute delirium.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.842
Well, she's talking, right?
I mean, she's coming out of it.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.887
No, she's not really talking,
just making sounds.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.513
Okay. When's she
gonna come out?

18:18.639 --> 18:22.142
Jeremy, she's in a coma.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.943
So her vitals
are pretty stable,

18:32.069 --> 18:34.821
but her response to stimuli
is getting weaker,

18:34.947 --> 18:36.656
which means the coma's
getting worse.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.201
Her brain is slowly
shutting down.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.911
Can I see her?

18:41.037 --> 18:44.247
We're getting some more images
to check for masses or infections.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.293
I'll increase your morphine.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.587
Her hallucination.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.675
If you knew what it was,
would that make any difference?

18:56.302 --> 18:58.136
Medically, I mean.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.721
Not usually.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.349
Some cases, the form of
a hallucination can tell us

19:02.475 --> 19:05.060
what part of the brain
is being hit.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.062
I think it was about my dad.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.981
Your dad was
breaking your arm?

19:11.692 --> 19:15.821
He was a drunk,
pill-popping racist.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.783
He caught me sneaking
into her house when we were 13.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.952
She lived next door.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.206
He broke my arm
and threatened her.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.376
We ran off when we were 16.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.254
You still in touch with him?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.507
He killed himself
a couple years ago.

19:39.220 --> 19:43.181
Oh, it's not medical. I just thought
blacks were the racist ones.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.315
Some generalized
edema throughout,

19:52.441 --> 19:56.027
and areas of increased signal
here, here, here and here.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.446
Damn, all over her brain stem.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.408
Could be plaques,
maybe hyperdensities from the edema.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.118
Or tumors or anything.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.955
We add brain involvement to the chest,
stomach, throat, what do we got?

20:07.081 --> 20:09.040
Didn't spike a fever
when we took her off the steroids,

20:09.166 --> 20:11.042
- so it's not an infection.
- Leaving environmental.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.085
What flavor?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.461
Environmental doesn't make sense,
either.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.297
If it was a toxin,
we'd see it in their livers.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.173
None of the neighbors
are sick, no coworkers.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.341
They both got it.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.303
That means infection or environmental,
and since it's not an infection...

20:21.429 --> 20:23.722
What if they
didn't both get it?

20:23.848 --> 20:26.850
Maybe we got our basic assumption
wrong and it's two different diseases.

20:26.976 --> 20:30.270
Maybe we didn't and
it's sarcoidosis.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.898
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious
or environmental.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.817
Tell that to the clusters
of sarcoidosis cases.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.987
Firefighters and residents
of pine tar forests?

20:39.113 --> 20:42.115
I did see these two putting out
that blaze in the Pine Barrens.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.076
If sarcoidosis has
two environmental causes,

20:45.202 --> 20:46.912
it has environmental causes.

20:47.038 --> 20:50.582
We just don't know all
of them yet. Husband's chest.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.711
He has slightly enlarged
hilar lymph nodes.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.923
Sarcoidosis explains
almost all of their symptoms,

20:58.049 --> 21:00.008
including her getting worse
off the steroids.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.885
Doesn't explain
his throat swelling.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.053
That's what "almost" means.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.680
90% of sarcoidosis cases
have lung scarring.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.933
- Oh, 90?
- Oh, "almost"?

21:09.727 --> 21:10.977
Fine.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.356
Consult a specialist.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.493
If this is more
dating advice...

21:26.619 --> 21:28.995
Love to gossip,
but I got work to do.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.957
Is this sarcoidosis?

21:34.919 --> 21:36.628
It's pretty nonspecific.

21:36.754 --> 21:41.007
It could be granulomas,
could be plaques. What's this?

21:41.133 --> 21:44.928
Oh! Oh! You stole
Wendy's personnel file?

21:45.054 --> 21:48.723
In a way, aren't we all guilty
of bribing the janitor

21:48.849 --> 21:50.725
to take her file and
give it to me?

21:50.851 --> 21:53.103
Yes, I take my share
of the blame, but society's...

21:53.229 --> 21:54.813
First of all,
I'm not dating her.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.232
She is so wrong for you.

21:57.358 --> 22:01.361
You know she filed a form so the
hospital would take extra withholding?

22:01.487 --> 22:03.822
- Who does that?
- She's much too cautious for me.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.282
Point taken.
I'll start dating her

22:06.409 --> 22:09.160
so I can break up with her
and start dating a stripper.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.330
You're a miserable jerk
who can't stand to be alone.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.417
I didn't try to break up your marriages.
You did that yourself.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.878
My marriages were so crappy,
I was spending all my time with you.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.089
Your real fear is me having
a good relationship.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.341
Yes, it keeps me up at night.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.261
That and the Loch Ness monster,
global warming, evolution

22:26.387 --> 22:28.555
and other fictional concepts.

22:28.681 --> 22:33.101
Although, big romantic weekend
in the Poconos could change everything.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.148
You don't... No.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.485
I don't think
it's sarcoidosis.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.950
He says it's sarcoidosis.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.702
Start them both
on methotrexate.

22:50.828 --> 22:51.703
And if you're wrong?

22:51.829 --> 22:56.458
If Wilson's wrong,
we'll biopsy her just to be sure.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.001
Her brain stem?

22:58.127 --> 23:00.253
Brain damage is
not only possible, it's likely.

23:00.379 --> 23:04.799
Good point. Let's biopsy
something safer, like her shoes.

23:06.927 --> 23:10.847
The husband. He'd have to give consent.
He can't right now.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.849
Why? Does this guy write
with his stomach?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.642
He has a conflict of interest.

23:14.769 --> 23:17.562
It's not his brain we're cutting open,
but he still gets all the benefit.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.272
He'd do it
just to save himself.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.440
Or save her.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.941
She's the love of his life,
remember?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.234
He never said that.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.488
She needs a guardian ad litem.
I can't let you do this.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.199
Well, how are you going
to stop me? Call Cuddy?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.575
Cameron's right.
There's a conflict.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.118
No, there isn't.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.913
Not unless one of them
wants to die a horrible, painful death.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.414
I'm sure the guardian
will figure that out.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.208
In a couple days.

23:38.334 --> 23:41.002
Will the guardian convince the disease
to hold off eating her brain

23:41.128 --> 23:43.379
until we can get
the legalities worked out?

23:43.506 --> 23:46.257
I just don't want some
plaintiff's lawyer owning my hospital.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.093
Legalities help.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.345
Speaking of which,
did you get your thermometer back yet?

23:50.471 --> 23:53.932
We had a nice chat.
Did you know he's a Rotarian?

23:54.809 --> 23:57.268
Listen, she'll die
without the biopsy.

23:58.229 --> 24:01.981
I need to cover the hospital's ass.
You're too biased.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.776
I send you in there,
you'll steamroll over him.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.695
Something goes wrong, he'll sue us for
not disclosing the risks.

24:07.822 --> 24:09.531
Then have Wilson
talk to the husband.

24:09.657 --> 24:13.076
Wilson kills people left and right.
No one ever sues him.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.496
Fine, but only if you apologize
to the clinic guy.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.040
No. Probably better
to just let that couple die.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.001
I don't care if you mean it.
Just do it.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.091
Unfortunately, we don't see
any way around a biopsy.

24:28.217 --> 24:30.844
We'll do all we can
to minimize any damage.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.011
No.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.722
The methotrexate isn't showing
any effects yet.

24:34.849 --> 24:35.723
You could both be...

24:35.850 --> 24:37.684
She's brilliant.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.187
All A's in college
while working full-time.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.730
I can't do that to her.

24:42.857 --> 24:45.859
And if you both die,
you think she'd want that?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.196
Do it on me instead.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.574
- It's not in your brain.
- It will be.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.577
It's the same disease, right?
Do it then.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.872
She could die
before you show the symptoms.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.957
Then stop treating me.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.754
Great job. Why didn't you just
shoot him in the head?

25:06.881 --> 25:07.755
Hold on.
That gives me an idea.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.300
You know what could save this couple?
Lots of misdirected sarcasm.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.094
They're dead! Yelling at you
might prevent you from screwing up...

25:13.220 --> 25:14.470
I didn't screw up.
I did my job.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.055
Your job was
to get me the biopsy.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.932
No, it was to present
the patient with his options.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.809
Two options,
biopsy or no biopsy.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.562
He chose a third, no treatment.
How do you even do that?

25:22.688 --> 25:25.356
Remember when you used to just weave
elaborate conspiracy theories

25:25.482 --> 25:26.774
about my love life?

25:26.901 --> 25:29.235
Those were such good times.

25:32.406 --> 25:33.823
How much morphine
is the husband on?

25:33.949 --> 25:37.368
We can't increase it any more.
His respirations are depressed.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.496
Increase it?
Drugs cloud people's judgment.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.790
Cold-turkey the sucker.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.001
No.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.004
Good point.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.767
Did I ask you guys
to follow me?

26:00.893 --> 26:03.144
No, which made us nervous.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.897
He'll catch on if he notices
he's off the morphine drip.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.858
Shoot him up with one of
these puppies instead.

26:08.984 --> 26:09.984
No!

26:10.110 --> 26:11.569
You do understand
it's not really a puppy.

26:11.737 --> 26:12.904
It's naloxone.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.157
An opiate blocker? He'll feel like
he's swallowing a bonfire.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.867
That's pretty unethical,
even for you.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.953
How is that unethical?
It'll lead to a diagnosis.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.579
It's leading to
the torture of the husband

26:21.705 --> 26:23.873
on the off-chance he'll allow
a procedure on another person.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.042
Which will lead to a diagnosis.
Didn't I just say that?

26:26.210 --> 26:27.043
Give it up.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.879
Foreman and Cameron are too ethical,
and I'm too scared of getting sued.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.424
Fine. Now, I'm just going to
find someplace safe to hide this

26:33.550 --> 26:34.884
so I won't be tempted
to use it.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.220
You're not doing it, either.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.097
What, are you going
to run for it?

26:40.975 --> 26:46.312
If they die now, they'll never be able
to grow old and tired of each other.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.406
We can't baby-sit
House all day.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.033
Tell Cuddy to put a nurse
by his room.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.119
Damn it!

27:03.789 --> 27:05.832
Atropine? What happened to...

27:08.002 --> 27:11.921
He knew we'd stop him.
He stuck both of them in his pocket.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.924
That's actually pretty clever.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.762
Guess I can't use
that trick again, huh?

27:20.556 --> 27:22.473
My stomach!

27:24.393 --> 27:28.021
It was a pretty smart plan,
Jerry, but I'm onto you.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.565
There's only one good reason
to kill the biopsy.

27:30.691 --> 27:33.776
You poisoned your wife, and you don't
want the coppers to get wise.

27:33.902 --> 27:34.736
No!

27:34.862 --> 27:37.071
Oh, all right. Then you're just a moron.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.573
Biopsy me!

27:38.699 --> 27:41.826
Only if this thing hits
your brain, you moron.

27:41.952 --> 27:44.078
And I can't stress
that "moron" part enough.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.371
You're killing your wife.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.749
She is the love of my life.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.419
Careful. When she's dead
and you're on wife number two,

27:51.545 --> 27:53.880
you're gonna feel real guilty
about saying that.

27:54.006 --> 27:57.008
Feel that? Get used to it.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.134
Pain's going to get
a lot worse.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.552
No, it won't.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.555
Morphine just isn't working
right now for some reason.

28:02.681 --> 28:06.017
I'm putting you on a tranquilizer
in the meantime. It'll work again soon.

28:06.143 --> 28:07.101
Want to bet?

28:07.227 --> 28:09.437
I don't care about the pain.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.731
I need to be in pain,
because I have to get worse.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.025
It means you can do
the biopsy on me.

28:14.151 --> 28:17.236
Dude, she's in a coma.
Who are you trying to impress?

28:17.738 --> 28:18.988
I'd die for her.

28:21.325 --> 28:25.536
Give up. Or are we going to wait for him
to get all grown up and cynical?

28:30.417 --> 28:31.459
I was just going to call you.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.212
I need a court order
to biopsy this woman's brain.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.172
Speaking of litigation...

28:38.550 --> 28:41.427
Michael Tritter,
you know Dr. House.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.264
You guys can talk here.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.937
I don't want to sue you.

28:51.063 --> 28:51.938
Good.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.357
I want to beat
the crap out of you.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.984
- Less good.
- And I'll tell you why.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.488
You're a bully,

29:01.615 --> 29:04.742
and bullies,
they don't back down

29:04.868 --> 29:07.995
until they run into someone
stronger and meaner.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.331
But you'll accept an apology?

29:10.457 --> 29:11.582
Yes.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.168
Not really a recipe
for sincerity.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.129
I'm not looking
for sincerity.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.089
I'm looking for humiliation,

29:18.215 --> 29:20.133
something that will make you think twice

29:20.259 --> 29:22.969
before you treat
the next patient like crap.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.930
Here's what's going to happen.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.098
You go brag to your friends

29:27.224 --> 29:29.892
about how you made
the big, nasty doctor poop in his pants.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.479
I get Cuddy off my back
by telling her that I humiliated myself.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.816
Here's the catch.
We're both going to be lying.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.986
I'm not apologizing.

29:40.946 --> 29:44.031
If anything,
you deserved a bigger thermometer.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.125
- What's wrong?
- Jeremy's worse.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.793
And that's what's right.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.713
Cut the stubborn jerk's
head open and take a slice.

29:58.839 --> 29:59.881
It's not his brain.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.675
Lactic acid's up to 39.
His intestines are rotting.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.385
This isn't sarcoidosis.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.512
Then he'll get his wish.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.976
He's dying, just not in a way
that's going to help his wife.

30:14.396 --> 30:17.064
Coma's worse.
She's losing response to stimuli.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.317
He's vomiting blood
and his lactic acid's 45.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.486
- He's got to have ischemic bowel.
- So what?

30:21.612 --> 30:24.906
Well, let's see. Lack of blood flow's
causing his guts to die,

30:25.032 --> 30:26.157
which will cause him to die,

30:26.283 --> 30:28.910
unless we cut out a few feet of
small intestine and reattach the ends.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.203
I don't know,
seems worth a mention.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.205
Why does he have it?
What does it tell us?

30:32.331 --> 30:33.498
Small-cell vasculitis?

30:33.624 --> 30:35.041
Good. Now let's hear it again,

30:35.167 --> 30:37.585
but this time with a more environmental
or infectious feeling.

30:37.711 --> 30:41.339
Or, like I said before, it might not be
environmental or infectious.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.299
He has vasculitis,
she has porphyria.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.927
Belly pain plus hallucination,
classic symptoms.

30:46.053 --> 30:48.179
It could even cause a coma.

30:49.306 --> 30:52.099
Fine. Start her on
hematin for porphyria.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.309
What about him?

30:53.435 --> 30:55.811
Take out the dead bowel.
It's all we can do.

30:55.938 --> 30:58.147
And biopsy it.
If Foreman's right, it might save him.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.400
If Foreman's wrong, the dead bowel
might save both of them.

31:06.615 --> 31:07.698
Bowel's not dead.

31:07.824 --> 31:12.119
Unless he's been tossing down frosty
cans of lactic acid, bowel is dead.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.955
What we're looking for
is a reason it's dead.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.331
Bowel's not dead.

31:15.457 --> 31:19.835
Just general swelling and edema.
High lactate was probably from stress.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.838
We just sliced him open
from chest to pubic bone for nothing.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.009
Nothing's something.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.055
Forget the ischemia.
Add the edema and swelling.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.557
Probably from
cutting him open.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.684
Probably, not definitely.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.060
Okay, back to the beginning.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.980
What did we talk about?
Anything. I want to hear it all again.

31:39.106 --> 31:41.232
Allergies.
Doesn't fit at all now.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.693
STDs. Maybe we
got the wrong one.

31:43.819 --> 31:44.777
What about syphilis?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.612
- Neurological symptoms.
- He wasn't cheating on her.

31:46.738 --> 31:50.032
Yeah, love of his life.
Don't you have to wait till he's dead

31:50.158 --> 31:51.284
before you make
that determination?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.077
She's his only
girlfriend ever.

31:53.203 --> 31:56.831
They grew up next door,
ran off together as teenagers.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.750
Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it out
because we thought he had ischemic...

31:59.876 --> 32:01.544
- Why did they run off?
- What difference does...

32:01.670 --> 32:03.588
Kids talk about running off.
How many do it?

32:03.714 --> 32:04.714
What was the reason?

32:04.840 --> 32:07.717
They were trying to escape
his evil, pill-popping, racist dad.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.969
You would've liked him.
We should do another...

32:10.095 --> 32:11.762
How do you know
the dad was racist?

32:11.888 --> 32:15.016
He beat up his son for dating
a black girl. I extrapolated from that.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.059
You see racism everywhere.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.979
Maybe he just didn't
like this black girl.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.106
It's not sarcoid.
We would have seen granulomas in his...

32:22.232 --> 32:23.858
She has pretty eyes.

32:27.613 --> 32:31.616
Forget infectious.
Forget environmental.

32:31.742 --> 32:35.828
Defective DNA is keeping them
from making a critical protein,

32:35.954 --> 32:38.164
hence the fluid build-up.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.499
Hits the throat, stomach,
chest and brain.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.043
Angioedema?

32:42.169 --> 32:46.005
Hereditary angioedema.
Symptoms fit perfectly.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.967
It's an incredibly rare disease.
They both would have to have a parent...

32:50.093 --> 32:53.387
Is it a coincidence
that your sister has great hair,

32:53.847 --> 32:56.766
or that these two
have green eyes?

32:58.268 --> 33:01.646
You're not saying...
They're not brother and sister.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.608
God, no. That would be sick.

33:05.734 --> 33:09.403
Half brother and sister.
Different moms.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.740
Dad must have had
an affair with her mom.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.493
That's why he flipped out
when the kids started dating.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.328
He had it himself.
Probably why the pills.

33:17.454 --> 33:18.621
We won't know for sure...

33:18.747 --> 33:22.249
Testing for HAE or paternity
is going to take a day.

33:22.376 --> 33:26.128
She doesn't have a day.
Start treating and see what happens.

33:34.012 --> 33:34.929
Any change?

33:35.055 --> 33:37.682
Her response to stimuli
is still just as weak.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.142
I almost hope
she stays in a coma.

33:40.435 --> 33:41.727
That's sweet, Cameron.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.813
I'd like to avoid shattering
both of their lives.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.107
You don't think
dying will do that?

33:52.823 --> 33:55.032
It's just her oximeter.

33:59.830 --> 34:03.374
Tracy.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.920
She's awake.

34:12.551 --> 34:16.595
Oh, God, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

34:21.977 --> 34:24.061
Awesome. Can I tell them?

34:24.187 --> 34:26.397
We've obviously got to
let them know what's wrong.

34:26.523 --> 34:30.735
But the cause,
the brother-sister thing...

34:30.861 --> 34:35.281
Good plan. We just gotta keep them away
from doctors, the Internet

34:35.407 --> 34:37.700
and anyone who's
not a total moron.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.034
Tell them.

34:39.161 --> 34:42.288
Yesterday he was willing to die
to save her.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.039
We've gotta give him time to recover.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.584
He might be a little vexed
that you kept letting him

34:46.710 --> 34:48.878
hump his sister in the meantime.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.504
Tell them.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.883
Look, unless their dad was also
the product of an incestuous union,

34:54.009 --> 34:56.635
the chances of serious
complications are minimal.

34:56.762 --> 35:01.390
Noble of you to take that risk.
Tell them, or I will.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.812
So we just need
to take these pills?

35:06.938 --> 35:08.314
Twice a day.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.650
Angioedema is very treatable.
You'll be fine.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.029
So, what? We, like,
caught this from each other?

35:15.155 --> 35:18.574
No, it's a condition
you've both always had.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.620
The onset of symptoms are
sometimes caused by stress or trauma.

35:22.746 --> 35:23.788
The incident at the diner.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.998
So we got it as kids?

35:26.124 --> 35:30.795
It's a genetic disease.
It's not...

35:32.672 --> 35:37.009
There's no good reason
two unrelated people would get it.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.181
We think you guys
should take a DNA test.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.852
How can we be related?

35:51.066 --> 35:52.900
We think you have
the same dad.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.446
We won't know for sure
until we do the test.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.240
Oh, God!

36:06.540 --> 36:08.332
Your father.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.376
No. No, this can't be true.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.587
Yeah. Yeah, Jer, I'm lighter.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.631
You know, I'm lighter
than both my parents.

36:15.757 --> 36:20.261
And our eyes. Everyone always talks
about how we have the same eyes.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.847
You're not really siblings.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.102
We have the same father!

36:29.062 --> 36:31.939
You didn't fight in
the backseat on car trips.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.108
You didn't change
each other's diapers.

36:34.234 --> 36:38.153
You guys just met
and fell in love.

36:40.490 --> 36:44.785
The way you feel,
that hasn't changed.

37:13.648 --> 37:17.151
Hey, Foreman, can you wear the beeper
for a couple of hours this weekend?

37:17.277 --> 37:18.569
What?

37:18.695 --> 37:20.362
We just destroyed
two people's lives.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.197
So I'm not allowed to
run errands anymore?

37:22.324 --> 37:23.949
I'd like to see some sign
that it affects you,

37:24.075 --> 37:26.285
or that you recognize
it affects other people.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.953
So are you going to wear
the beeper or not?

37:28.079 --> 37:29.747
Sorry, I can't.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.334
You just want to punish me.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.794
I'm busy.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.171
With what?

37:37.797 --> 37:40.257
Going out of town.

37:41.885 --> 37:44.011
Where are you going?

37:46.139 --> 37:51.018
Foreman, you're not missing
a blue shoe, are you?

37:55.899 --> 37:57.316
Come...

37:57.859 --> 38:00.778
You can't bet when you know
the answer beforehand.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.447
We could spend all day
arguing whether you can bet

38:03.573 --> 38:04.949
when you know
the answer beforehand.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.076
Give me the 200 bucks.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.592
What?

38:28.598 --> 38:30.182
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.611
You okay?

38:42.737 --> 38:46.156
I was just wondering,
do you really like jazz?

38:46.282 --> 38:47.950
I love it.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.785
Are you lying?

38:51.663 --> 38:52.579
I'm lying.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.419
I want to spend time with you.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.504
Is that so terrible?

39:01.423 --> 39:02.715
No.

39:07.220 --> 39:11.557
Maybe we shouldn't walk out together.
If people see us leaving...

39:11.683 --> 39:14.435
Everybody's got to
find out sometime.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.193
Let me just meet you
at your place.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.248
She got her own room.

39:39.085 --> 39:42.796
She just needs
some time alone.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.847
Do you want me to
hang out here a bit?

41:25.024 --> 41:27.401
If you've come to return
the thermometer, don't bother.

41:27.527 --> 41:28.569
I've moved on.

41:28.695 --> 41:33.031
If you'd actually read my chart,
you'd have known that I'm a cop.

41:34.159 --> 41:37.369
You were going 40
in a 25 zone.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.454
Oh, come on.

41:40.165 --> 41:43.041
This isn't because I was speeding,
this is because I'm Latino.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.377
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

41:45.503 --> 41:49.047
Sorry, cool jacket.
Only pockets for important stuff.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.799
That's a shame.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.969
A 50 buck ticket?

41:54.095 --> 41:56.221
Is that your way of
beating me up,

41:56.347 --> 41:58.307
or is that just the price
for sticking something in you?

41:58.433 --> 42:01.185
You took a pill
while you were examining a patient.

42:01.311 --> 42:04.146
That's serious
addictive behavior.

42:06.399 --> 42:09.484
I'm betting that
you're holding right now.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.655
I wasn't weaving.
I'm not drunk.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.783
- You've got no reason to...
- Pupils dilated.

42:16.910 --> 42:19.620
Appear to be under
the influence of a narcotic.

42:19.746 --> 42:23.790
Would you mind turning around, please,
and putting your hands behind your head?

42:23.917 --> 42:27.169
Does that polite crap
ever work on people?

42:29.047 --> 42:35.135
Most people realize
there's only one answer.

42:42.352 --> 42:43.560
You got a prescription?

42:43.686 --> 42:45.979
I'm a cripple who
works in a hospital.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.940
You don't think
I can get a valid prescription?

42:48.066 --> 42:49.858
Arrogant son of a bitch
like you?

42:49.984 --> 42:52.486
I'm going to bet
you didn't bother.

42:52.612 --> 42:59.243
You are under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

42:59.369 --> 43:01.536
You have the right
to remain silent,

43:01.663 --> 43:05.249
which you should take advantage of
for once in your life.

43:05.375 --> 43:06.750
If you give up the right
to remain silent,

43:06.876 --> 43:10.337
anything you say
can and will be used against you...
