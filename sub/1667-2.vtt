All of your scheming,

00:06.817 --> 00:08.851
every single day
of your miserable life,

00:08.852 --> 00:11.835
what results did you expect,

00:11.836 --> 00:13.956
that your child would be born
into a happy life?

00:13.957 --> 00:16.297
This was our family's hope.

00:16.299 --> 00:18.027
We need to regain
control of the city.

00:18.028 --> 00:19.662
I'm fighting for my home,

00:19.663 --> 00:21.530
for the dignity of the vampires
who were run out of there.

exists to join me.

our mother would not be bound

00:28.853 --> 00:30.606

If Mikael were upon us,

I imagine Niklaus
would be quite dead.

01:35.253 --> 01:36.330

01:36.331 --> 01:37.899
Father left the head of my horse

01:37.900 --> 01:40.301
on a pike in the town square.

01:40.302 --> 01:42.803
He killed poor Theo?

01:42.804 --> 01:45.840
What a beast...

01:45.841 --> 01:49.975
But then, father has
always hated you most.

01:49.976 --> 01:53.114
Surely, he'll chase you
if you flee, leaving me here.

It is imperative
we remain together.

01:59.087 --> 02:02.623
Rebekah does what she's
told because he fears Nik,

02:02.624 --> 02:07.561
and Finn is in
no position to argue,

02:07.562 --> 02:11.246
given the dagger in his heart.

02:11.247 --> 02:13.934
I'll take my chances here.

I find it amusing that you
think you have a choice.

No. I swear to you,
the day will come

02:25.080 --> 02:27.481
when I'm not so easily subdued,

02:27.482 --> 02:30.891
and on that day,
I will make you suffer.

is not that day.

So Klaus took me out
to the cauldron.

Wouldn't you know,
we ran into some witches.

to locate the white oak

unable to do so,

She grows more
savage by the day.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.698
Can you not see that
she is falling apart?

04:59.699 --> 05:03.335

is your high standards.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.128

05:05.129 --> 05:06.872
Being a vampire only exaggerates

12:51.647 --> 12:53.347
Awesome.

12:53.348 --> 12:55.249
All we got to do is find them.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.686
A task I leave to you.
Well, go on.

12:58.687 --> 13:01.771
You're a hybrid now
with heightened senses

13:01.772 --> 13:06.259
unlike anything under
the sun besides me.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.528
[Inhales]

13:07.529 --> 13:10.047
[Exhales]

13:13.934 --> 13:16.202
This is stupid.

13:16.203 --> 13:19.372
Your people need a leader.

13:19.373 --> 13:20.875
You are their queen.

13:20.876 --> 13:23.010
I am a mess.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.063
I cry all day.
I feed all night.

13:28.073 --> 13:33.887
All I can think about is how
much I miss my daughter.

13:33.888 --> 13:36.290
Do you think you're
alone in that pain?

13:36.291 --> 13:38.459
Have you even thought
about her once?

13:38.460 --> 13:41.120
I have not stopped
thinking about her.

13:41.236 --> 13:44.498
When it pains me, I seek
comfort in the idea

13:44.499 --> 13:46.793
of what I will do to those
who would harm her.

14:00.939 --> 14:02.558
Concentrate.

14:18.765 --> 14:21.017
Davina is on her way.

14:21.018 --> 14:23.270
By the time she gets here,
you need to be gone.

14:23.271 --> 14:24.571
I'm not going
anywhere till I know

14:24.572 --> 14:26.072
the whereabouts of that stake.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.407
You think she's just
gonna cooperate

14:27.408 --> 14:29.717
with you standing here?

14:29.718 --> 14:31.745
First thing I learned
living with your family,

14:31.746 --> 14:33.513
wherever you people go,

14:33.514 --> 14:36.016
threats and bloodshed
are soon to follow.

14:36.017 --> 14:39.929
So just stay out of sight.
Try not to kill anyone.

14:50.730 --> 14:55.551
46, an entire
tenement building.

14:55.552 --> 14:59.439
46 bodies drained.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.242
Nonsense.

15:02.243 --> 15:04.110
It's at least 60.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.604
Ah, they neglected
to check the attic.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.781
Why do people always
run for the attic?

15:08.782 --> 15:10.383
I mean, it makes no sense.

15:10.384 --> 15:11.651
Elijah: It's difficult enough
to keep our presence

15:11.652 --> 15:12.952
in the city a secret
without the two of you

15:12.953 --> 15:14.921
doing absolutely
everything in your power

15:14.922 --> 15:16.289
to draw attention to us.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.450
I'm surprised you have the time
to concern yourself with us,

15:19.451 --> 15:22.762
given the hours you spend
doting on Marcellus.

15:22.763 --> 15:25.122
Is that what all this is about?

15:25.123 --> 15:28.434
You envy my bond with Marcellus.

15:28.435 --> 15:32.471
Niklaus, you brought
that child into this home.

15:32.472 --> 15:34.882
He is no longer safe here.

15:34.883 --> 15:36.676
I cannot allow him to remain.

15:36.677 --> 15:38.886
You would punish the boy
because of Kol's antics?

15:38.887 --> 15:40.646
I'd just as soon
put him in a box.

15:40.647 --> 15:43.182
You'd choose that little
whelp over our own family?

15:43.183 --> 15:47.053
That little whelp is our family.

15:47.054 --> 15:49.854
Marcellus stays.

15:55.795 --> 15:58.497
Hey.

15:58.498 --> 16:00.199
Long time, little D.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.967
Got your text.
What's going on?

16:01.968 --> 16:04.670
Oh, come here.
I don't get a hug?

16:04.671 --> 16:07.139
It's good to see you, Marcel.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.275
It's good to see you, too.

16:09.276 --> 16:12.336
I appreciate you coming
all the way out here.

16:12.337 --> 16:14.714
How's school?
Make any new friends?

16:14.715 --> 16:16.682
I don't know.

16:16.683 --> 16:20.594
This guy asked me out,
but then he stood me up.

16:20.595 --> 16:22.154
- He stood you up?
- Mm-hmm.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.555
You say the word, he's dead.

16:23.556 --> 16:25.307
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha!

16:25.308 --> 16:27.126
Ok. Look.

16:27.127 --> 16:32.397
I hate to ask for a favor,
but I need a locator spell.

16:32.398 --> 16:35.634
Something is missing...
A white oak stake.

16:35.635 --> 16:37.862
It's powerful enough
to kill an original.

16:39.404 --> 16:41.342
Did one of them
put you up to this?

16:41.808 --> 16:43.492
D, if that stake
is used on Klaus,

16:43.493 --> 16:46.704
every vampire that
he sired dies, too.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.513
I know.

16:48.514 --> 16:50.849
What if I do find it?

16:50.850 --> 16:52.751
I mean, I am not just
gonna give it to Klaus.

16:52.752 --> 16:55.554
He and Elijah are both
brutal, sadistic monsters.

16:55.555 --> 16:58.549
I do wish I could
disagree with you.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.737
Tragically, however,
you're quite right.

17:05.196 --> 17:06.832
Although you and I both have

17:06.833 --> 17:09.367
excellent reason
to find that weapon.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.935
I want it to protect my family,

17:10.936 --> 17:14.022
and you want it to
protect your friends.

17:14.023 --> 17:19.644
We'd do well to forget our
grievances and join forces.

17:19.645 --> 17:22.323
No.

17:22.324 --> 17:24.249
- Davina, would you just...
- No.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.785
No. I'm done listening.

17:26.786 --> 17:29.621
For a long time,
you and your family

17:29.622 --> 17:31.142
have had all the power.

17:31.624 --> 17:35.727
You manipulate and kill
anyone who gets in your way.

17:35.728 --> 17:37.023
That time is over.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.859
From now on, you can know
what it is to be afraid.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.805
I asked you to stay
out of sight.

17:47.806 --> 17:49.607
I wanted to speak
to her face to face.

17:49.608 --> 17:51.769
Why, so that you
could piss her off?

17:51.770 --> 17:55.314
I wanted to see for myself.

17:55.315 --> 17:57.115
She cares for you,
and yet how cavalier

17:57.116 --> 17:59.844
she was at the jeopardy
that you now face.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.219
What are you saying?

18:01.220 --> 18:02.653
She knows the stake
will not be used

18:02.654 --> 18:05.790
because she knows
precisely where it is.

18:05.791 --> 18:08.825
She's had it all along.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.152
Hayley: So Jackson is MIA,

18:16.153 --> 18:18.020
and Oliver seems to think
he's the alpha.

18:18.021 --> 18:19.522
They're not gonna listen to me.

18:19.523 --> 18:20.923
The crescent Mark
on your shoulder

18:20.924 --> 18:23.425
did not disappear when
you became a hybrid.

18:23.426 --> 18:26.572
Go on. Talk to them.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.574
What the hell you two want?

18:38.575 --> 18:41.176
Hold your tongue, or I'll tear
it from your gaping mouth.

18:41.177 --> 18:44.071
We didn't come here
to fight, Oliver.

18:44.072 --> 18:45.714
Our pack has been divided
by people

18:45.715 --> 18:48.200
that want us to be their slaves.

18:48.201 --> 18:50.744
What we need right now
is a leader,

18:50.745 --> 18:53.789
someone who will reunite us
and make us strong again,

18:53.790 --> 18:56.892
someone who will
fight for our pack.

18:56.893 --> 18:59.828
If you let me,
I can be that person.

18:59.829 --> 19:01.630
Oliver: You think
we can trust you?

19:01.631 --> 19:04.032
You're not one of us.
Hell, you're not even a wolf.

19:04.033 --> 19:06.260
You're a bloodsucking
vampire parasite.

19:06.261 --> 19:09.138
Want to say that again
and see what happens, Oliver?

19:09.139 --> 19:10.572
Tough girl.

19:10.573 --> 19:14.409
You gonna attack me
in front of all them?

19:14.410 --> 19:16.044
You'll just give them
another reason to say yes

19:16.045 --> 19:17.913
to Cassie and her
moonlight rings.

19:17.914 --> 19:21.049
Yeah. They would rather
follow a witch than you.

19:21.050 --> 19:23.921
Me, hell, I would rather
die than follow you.

19:26.054 --> 19:27.865
Well, we shouldn't
drag this out.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.758
Let him go, Klaus.

19:29.759 --> 19:32.360
You need to learn about
the art of politics, luv.

19:32.361 --> 19:33.662
You gain support by
killing your detractors.

19:33.663 --> 19:35.163
They may not like me very much,

19:35.164 --> 19:38.300
but these people, including
Oliver, are my family.

19:38.301 --> 19:41.397
Let him go now.

19:43.772 --> 19:46.841
You see, there's your queen...

19:46.842 --> 19:52.658
Powerful, fearless, and,
unlike me, merciful.

19:55.710 --> 19:59.521
These people need
to show you more respect.

19:59.522 --> 20:02.650
How you handle them now
is up to you.

20:02.651 --> 20:04.559
Where are you going?

20:04.560 --> 20:06.794
I'm going to find the witch.

20:06.795 --> 20:09.030
Seems I need to educate her
as to what she may

20:09.031 --> 20:11.700
or may not do in my city.

20:11.701 --> 20:14.013
[Viola playing]

20:17.065 --> 20:18.973
Marcel: The stake is safe.

20:18.974 --> 20:21.442
Davina won't use it on
Klaus if it would kill me.

20:21.443 --> 20:24.045
Well, she has no reason
whatsoever not to use it on me.

20:24.046 --> 20:26.147
I guess you better behave.

20:26.148 --> 20:28.449
And how long before someone else
should make this discovery?

20:28.450 --> 20:30.118
What if it falls
into enemy hands?

20:30.119 --> 20:32.487
Look. I'll get her to give
the stake back, all right?

20:32.488 --> 20:33.955
Just give me some time.

20:33.956 --> 20:36.157
Unfortunately, Marcel,
unlike these wretched souls

20:36.158 --> 20:38.392
that you recruit here,
your promises

20:38.393 --> 20:40.328
do little to inspire my faith.

20:40.329 --> 20:42.463
One way or another,
Davina will comply.

20:42.464 --> 20:47.401
Ok. Do you ever wonder why your
family has so many enemies?

20:47.402 --> 20:49.103
It's because you make
stupid moves like this.

20:49.104 --> 20:50.404
It really makes me
wonder how the hell

20:50.405 --> 20:52.907
I ever survived you people.

20:52.908 --> 20:54.742
Young Marcel:
Please let me go home.

20:54.743 --> 20:56.844
Mr. Kol, I don't like this.

20:56.845 --> 20:58.179
Don't be absurd.

20:58.180 --> 21:01.015
Shakespeare should be
experienced in the flesh.

21:01.016 --> 21:02.483
In truth, these aren't
the finest actors,

21:02.484 --> 21:04.952
but we are in the colonies.

21:04.953 --> 21:08.322
Here. Where were we?

21:08.323 --> 21:11.802
Then, venom, to thy work.

21:11.803 --> 21:14.179
Ugh!

21:14.180 --> 21:16.682
[Gasps]

21:16.683 --> 21:19.143
Man: Exchange forgiveness
with me, noble harlot.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.371
No.

21:22.703 --> 21:25.905
How many times must I tell you?

21:27.775 --> 21:29.910
It's "Hamlet," not "harlot."

21:29.911 --> 21:31.947
Uh!

21:31.948 --> 21:34.348
Sometimes I don't
know why I bother.

21:34.349 --> 21:36.984
What have you done?

21:36.985 --> 21:39.720
I was just introducing
Marcellus to the theater.

21:39.721 --> 21:42.856
I thought you'd be pleased.

21:42.857 --> 21:45.959
Is there no limit to your
vile imagination, brother?

21:45.960 --> 21:47.561
If the lad is going
to be a vampire,

21:47.562 --> 21:51.365
he'll have to learn
somehow, won't he?

21:51.366 --> 21:52.760
Come.

21:52.761 --> 21:54.321
I've already fed him my blood.

21:54.437 --> 22:01.742
All you have to do is snuff
him, and, voila, one of us.

22:01.743 --> 22:03.509
Well, that's what you want...

22:04.411 --> 22:07.147
Isn't it?

22:07.148 --> 22:10.504
Let him go, Elijah.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.356
Thank you, Nik.

22:16.357 --> 22:18.792
At least someone knows
the meaning of family.

22:18.793 --> 22:21.193
I told you before.

22:22.729 --> 22:26.502
Marcellus is family.

22:26.503 --> 22:28.234
Unh!

22:28.235 --> 22:30.103
I don't fault you
for your suspicion,

22:30.104 --> 22:31.757
nor Davina for her contempt.

22:31.758 --> 22:34.093
That does not alter
our present dilemma.

22:34.094 --> 22:35.975
She has that stake.

22:35.976 --> 22:38.278
I want it back.

22:38.279 --> 22:39.446
Stare at it all you want,

22:39.447 --> 22:42.976
but as long as I have
this bracelet, I own you.

22:42.977 --> 22:44.751
You foolish little girl.

22:44.752 --> 22:47.220
You imprison me here,
you refuse my help.

22:47.221 --> 22:50.442
All the while, that hybrid
monstrosity roams the city,

22:50.443 --> 22:53.028
free to prey on anyone
you care about,

22:53.029 --> 22:56.663
those few that remain.

22:56.664 --> 22:58.430
[Cell phone chimes]

23:04.274 --> 23:06.639
What happened to decorum?

23:06.640 --> 23:09.813
Does no one greet
their guests anymore?

23:24.753 --> 23:27.493
Well, that's more like it,

23:27.494 --> 23:29.962
although I am rather
disappointed

23:29.963 --> 23:33.165
at how many of my once
formidable brethren

23:33.166 --> 23:37.948
have been neutered
by a 16-year-old girl.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.451
Where is she?

23:40.452 --> 23:43.809
Where is this witch
who dares craft moonlight rings

23:43.810 --> 23:45.432
without my permission?

23:47.613 --> 23:49.436
Cassie: Niklaus...

23:57.323 --> 23:59.613
I've been expecting you.

24:07.087 --> 24:10.815
I must offer my condolences

24:10.816 --> 24:13.233
on the tragic loss
of your child.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.587
Wasn't it your coven
who threatened her life?

24:17.920 --> 24:20.358
Is that tea your idea
of a peace offering?

24:20.359 --> 24:23.861
Chamomile has lots
of healing properties.

24:26.064 --> 24:29.901
Did you know that it's
also a flowering plant?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.636
I did.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.705
The plants grew wild
near my boyhood home,

24:33.706 --> 24:36.174
but neither the tea nor
your botanical musings

24:36.175 --> 24:37.809
explain the reason
why you've taken it

24:37.810 --> 24:40.879
upon yourself to forge
new moonlight rings.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.915
I assumed it was obvious.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.683
An alliance between
the wolves and the witches

24:45.684 --> 24:48.036
would restore balance
to our home.

24:48.520 --> 24:52.590
That's a lofty goal
for a teenage girl.

24:52.591 --> 24:55.943
Long ago, the witches
and the wolves were at peace.

24:55.944 --> 25:01.490
Then came the vampires,
a plague made flesh,

25:01.491 --> 25:03.568
a curse on this earth.

25:03.569 --> 25:09.540
You have no humanity, and
so you punish those who do.

25:09.541 --> 25:12.410
Witches have a coven,
werewolves have a pack,

25:12.411 --> 25:14.846
and so we are
a constant reminder

25:14.847 --> 25:17.839
of everything that
you have forsaken.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.551
Creatures such as you
will always hate the living,

25:20.552 --> 25:25.756
and so we will always
have to defend ourselves.

25:25.757 --> 25:28.392
The rings level
the playing field.

25:28.393 --> 25:32.729
If we ware united,
nothing can stand against us.

25:34.131 --> 25:36.168
It's an ambitious strategy,

25:36.635 --> 25:40.437
but allow me to offer
a few words of advice,

25:40.438 --> 25:42.473
if I may be so bold.

25:42.474 --> 25:46.477
New Orleans is a vicious place,

25:46.478 --> 25:49.747
and your enemies
are everywhere...

25:49.748 --> 25:53.917
Behind your back,
before your eyes.

25:53.918 --> 25:56.086
You will need to remain
vigilant against those

25:56.087 --> 25:58.463
who would seek to destroy you,

25:58.464 --> 26:01.225
some of whom you may
never see coming.

26:01.226 --> 26:05.162
I've already begun
to take precautions.

26:05.163 --> 26:08.492
In fact, I'm taking
them as we speak.

26:11.902 --> 26:14.304
My family?
Oh, no.

26:14.305 --> 26:17.608
They're all crazy as loons.

26:17.609 --> 26:19.526
How about your family?

26:19.527 --> 26:20.777
Not much to say.

26:20.778 --> 26:22.179
Only child.

26:22.180 --> 26:27.618
My dad was distant, which is
a lot better than my mom.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.828
Mommy issues, eh?

26:29.829 --> 26:32.664
Bet she's
a control freak, right?

26:32.665 --> 26:34.658
Yeah. Same as mine.

26:34.659 --> 26:39.129
She's the reason we stopped
practicing magic for so long.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.531
You're a witch?

26:41.532 --> 26:43.233
Don't look so surprised, luv.

26:43.234 --> 26:47.220
I didn't just ask you out
because you're gorgeous.

26:47.221 --> 26:50.515
No. We're, uh...
We're kindred souls.

26:50.516 --> 26:51.842
What do you mean?

26:51.843 --> 26:54.144
I know your story, Davina.

26:54.145 --> 26:55.896
I mean, you're
practically famous.

26:55.897 --> 27:00.083
You're the harvest girl who
told them all to shove it.

27:00.084 --> 27:02.319
I'm a lot like you.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.656
Don't really believe
in rules or authority.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.010
Your courage,
it should be celebrated.

27:11.187 --> 27:14.064
[Cell phone chiming]

27:14.065 --> 27:17.025
I'm so sorry.

27:17.026 --> 27:20.921
He'll just keep calling
until I answer.

27:20.922 --> 27:23.238
I'll make it quick.

27:28.496 --> 27:29.979
You're stalling.

27:29.980 --> 27:34.518
No. That's not creep at all,
watching me on me own date.

27:34.519 --> 27:37.646
Stop complimenting her and
find out what she's hiding.

27:37.647 --> 27:39.189
I'm wooing her, Vincent.

27:39.190 --> 27:42.234
It requires charm
and personality,

27:42.235 --> 27:45.027
something you'd
know nothing about.

27:45.028 --> 27:48.131
Our mother wants answers,
and if you can't get them,

27:48.132 --> 27:49.565
we'll do this my way.

27:49.566 --> 27:51.284
Oh. What are you gonna
do, you gonna bore her

27:51.285 --> 27:53.536
until she can't help
but tell you everything?

27:53.537 --> 27:54.770
If you want to find out
if someone has a weapon,

27:54.771 --> 27:57.139
you provoke them into using it.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.875
I never said I had it.

27:58.876 --> 28:01.110
The thing is, Elijah
thinks you do.

28:01.111 --> 28:03.279
Matter of fact, he's convinced.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.616
Well, let Elijah think
what he wants.

28:06.617 --> 28:07.843
You're not save, D.

28:07.844 --> 28:09.251
Anyone who's ever
wanted to kill an original

28:09.252 --> 28:10.887
is gonna be coming after you.

28:10.888 --> 28:13.348
Fine. Let them try.

28:13.349 --> 28:15.624
D, come on. Just
tell me where you are.

28:15.625 --> 28:17.193
Hey. We can talk about this.

28:17.194 --> 28:18.427
I'm at Rousseau's.
Don't bother coming.

28:18.428 --> 28:20.165
I'm leaving now.

28:26.235 --> 28:28.637
Kaleb?

28:28.638 --> 28:30.039
What's happening?

28:30.040 --> 28:31.740
Some fellow just announced
they were closing

28:31.741 --> 28:33.034
for a private party.

28:33.035 --> 28:34.410
We should leave now.

28:34.411 --> 28:36.478
And what's your
rush, sweetheart?

28:36.479 --> 28:39.124
Why don't you stay
and party with us?

28:39.125 --> 28:40.834
Get out of our way now.

28:44.614 --> 28:46.840
Can you do that
with the rest of them, or...

28:46.841 --> 28:48.258
Not all at once.

28:52.038 --> 28:53.429
Hey!

28:53.430 --> 28:55.029
Aah!

29:02.590 --> 29:04.705
[Chanting]

29:16.729 --> 29:19.321
Aah! Aah!

29:19.322 --> 29:20.517
Let go of her!

29:22.051 --> 29:24.563
You filthy dogs.

29:39.043 --> 29:42.456
Aah! Aah!

29:50.930 --> 29:52.364
Well, now.

29:52.365 --> 29:54.760
What an interesting turn
of events.

30:04.277 --> 30:06.480
I'm going to enjoy this, girl.

30:12.785 --> 30:14.469
Father.

30:14.470 --> 30:15.461
Hello, son.

30:15.462 --> 30:16.896
I'd hoped to see
your brother first,

30:16.897 --> 30:20.368
but we have some unfinished business,
as well.

30:27.091 --> 30:28.674
We're getting out of here.

30:28.675 --> 30:31.152
No, Marcel.
I need my bracelet.

30:31.153 --> 30:32.946
I can use it to control him.

30:36.082 --> 30:38.303
Aah!

30:41.314 --> 30:44.332
Stop!

30:44.333 --> 30:45.727
Go back now.

31:02.841 --> 31:04.527
Something to say?

31:04.528 --> 31:06.545
Not me, mate.

31:06.546 --> 31:07.999
Not a bloody thing.

31:11.049 --> 31:13.385
Chamomile.

31:13.386 --> 31:16.054
It's the same tea
my mother made.

31:16.055 --> 31:19.091
How I loathed it.

31:19.092 --> 31:21.012
Would you have preferred mint?

31:21.128 --> 31:25.397
You know, she was
insane... my mother.

31:25.398 --> 31:26.958
No. It's true.

31:26.959 --> 31:28.767
She believed we
were abominations.

31:28.768 --> 31:32.738
"A curse on this earth stretched
out over generations"

31:32.739 --> 31:35.216
is how she put it?

31:35.217 --> 31:37.969
But she was the true monster.

31:37.970 --> 31:40.278
She changed her children,

31:40.279 --> 31:43.448
stole our innocence,
made us vampires,

31:43.449 --> 31:47.018
condemned us to
an eternity of bloodlust

31:47.019 --> 31:52.564
and then acted as if
we were to blame.

31:53.392 --> 31:56.027
She sounds awful.

31:56.028 --> 31:59.331
Are you building
to a question, Niklaus?

31:59.332 --> 32:05.837
You use my full name as
though we are familiars.

32:05.838 --> 32:10.241
I find it insulting.

32:10.242 --> 32:13.511
Before she died,
a witch revealed

32:13.512 --> 32:18.983
that your coven was under
my mother's influence.

32:18.984 --> 32:21.012
Does she speak to you now?

32:21.013 --> 32:24.683
She doesn't have to.

32:24.684 --> 32:27.892
I know exactly
what she would say.

32:27.893 --> 32:32.496
She would tell you to go to
your room for being so rude.

32:41.559 --> 32:46.477
It's ok. Niklaus
was just leaving.

32:46.478 --> 32:48.479
I will happily kill them all.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.981
Then you will have
murdered members

32:49.982 --> 32:54.485
of the very pack you still
hope to someday lead.

32:54.486 --> 32:59.426
Besides, there's no need
for bloodshed.

32:59.427 --> 33:04.139
We can always resume
this discussion another day.

33:04.140 --> 33:06.660
Good night, Niklaus.

33:09.033 --> 33:11.067
We will speak again soon.

33:14.216 --> 33:16.044
Klaus: It is worse
than we thought.

33:18.471 --> 33:21.948
I met the witch...
Cassie.

33:21.949 --> 33:27.484
I studied her, her presence,
the way she carried herself,

33:27.485 --> 33:33.001
the fervor with which she
voiced her hatred of our kind.

33:33.002 --> 33:34.558
I looked into that girl's eyes,

33:34.559 --> 33:37.361
and I swear to you,
Elijah, she is not just

33:37.362 --> 33:38.696
guided by our mother.

33:38.697 --> 33:41.999
She is our mother.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.667
What is happening?

33:43.668 --> 33:45.680
I'm going to kill her.

33:45.681 --> 33:47.037
I will boil her bones

33:47.038 --> 33:49.440
and feed them to the dogs
if that's what it takes.

33:49.441 --> 33:50.541
Niklaus.

33:50.542 --> 33:51.875
What?!

33:51.876 --> 33:53.677
What could possibly
be more important

33:53.678 --> 33:55.315
than the return of our mother?

33:55.316 --> 33:57.247
Our father.

33:57.248 --> 33:59.129
I saw him standing
there in the flesh

33:59.617 --> 34:03.153
as you do now.

34:03.154 --> 34:06.390
He was enslaved with some
spell cast by Davina.

34:06.391 --> 34:11.456
He holds the stake.

34:11.456 --> 34:14.030
If she chooses to release him...

34:19.569 --> 34:20.704
Well, then there's
only one question

34:20.705 --> 34:22.819
we need to ask, isn't there?

34:28.911 --> 34:33.282
Which of our parents
do we kill first?

34:39.842 --> 34:42.811
Hayley: Take any of the rooms
on the first floor.

34:42.812 --> 34:44.822
Are we running a kennel now?

34:44.824 --> 34:46.866
I'll handle them.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.150
Our family is under siege.

34:48.150 --> 34:49.551
It is not the time for guests.

34:49.552 --> 34:52.087
If they're not with us,
they're with the witches.

34:52.088 --> 34:53.188
You asked me to step up.

34:53.188 --> 34:56.658
This is me stepping up.

34:56.659 --> 35:00.213
Well, it seems I'm a good
influence on you after all.

35:00.214 --> 35:02.465
Elijah, voice-over:
I see a change in him.

35:02.466 --> 35:04.843
For the first time in centuries,

35:04.844 --> 35:08.403
he acted solely
for the benefit of another.

35:08.404 --> 35:10.932
I believe that young Marcellus

35:10.933 --> 35:13.842
with whom he can identify
and even nurture

35:13.843 --> 35:17.188
holds the key
to our brother's troubled soul.

35:17.189 --> 35:19.732
Unfortunately, Kol,

35:19.733 --> 35:21.983
your wretched behavior
will only sere to distract him

35:21.984 --> 35:24.786
from this auspicious path.

35:24.787 --> 35:26.455
Now you might well consider
me a hypocrite

35:26.456 --> 35:32.806
to betray you as I have, for
his sake, you must sleep.

35:35.263 --> 35:38.299
Even I must make
certain sacrifices...

35:40.135 --> 35:42.270
If indeed we are the preserve
the precious bond

35:42.271 --> 35:44.805
between Niklaus and that child.

35:48.076 --> 35:49.210
Elijah, I did it!

35:49.211 --> 35:50.745
I memorized the whole passage.

35:50.746 --> 35:52.380
I could perform it for you.

35:52.381 --> 35:54.215
Could you now?
Marcellus, have you ever considered

35:54.216 --> 35:56.618
you might not be the center
of the given universe?

35:56.619 --> 35:57.919
Niklaus!

35:57.920 --> 35:59.287
Are you angry with me?

35:59.288 --> 36:00.989
Bored would be
a more accurate description.

36:00.990 --> 36:02.757
Niklaus, please!

36:02.758 --> 36:05.904
Klaus: What?
What is it?

36:05.905 --> 36:07.629
Remove him.

36:07.630 --> 36:09.631
You brought him here.
He's your burden to bear,

36:09.632 --> 36:13.429
if indeed we are to accommodate
this little scavenger.

36:19.974 --> 36:22.443
Come now, little warrior.

36:22.444 --> 36:25.012
Let's have another go
at the bard, shall we?

36:33.020 --> 36:35.475
Klaus: I don't see
Oliver amongst them.

36:35.476 --> 36:37.191
Am I to assume you
finished him off?

36:37.192 --> 36:38.626
We made a deal.

36:38.627 --> 36:40.294
He'll pledge
his loyalty to Cassie,

36:40.295 --> 36:43.358
report back,
and tell me everything that he learns.

36:43.359 --> 36:44.711
Well done.

36:53.007 --> 36:56.544
You girls can just
go through here.

36:56.545 --> 36:58.913
Well, you two have
your hands full.

36:58.914 --> 37:00.714
Were you just leaving?

37:04.018 --> 37:06.954
To be perfectly honest with you,

37:06.955 --> 37:08.389
the presence
of all of them here,

37:08.390 --> 37:10.323
it's... it's a little much.

37:13.627 --> 37:15.963
No. Perhaps it's for the best.

37:15.964 --> 37:18.286
You should be with your kind.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.441
Kaleb: What the bloody
hell was that, huh?

37:29.677 --> 37:31.712
You need to calm down now.

37:31.713 --> 37:33.414
You almost got me killed.

37:33.415 --> 37:34.748
Those wolves didn't
just go after Davina.

37:34.749 --> 37:35.983
They almost attacked me!

37:35.984 --> 37:38.684
I'm aware.
I gave the order.

37:43.402 --> 37:45.962
The attack had to
look convincing.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.839
Look at my head.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.397
This isn't gonna heal for weeks!

37:50.398 --> 37:53.011
I haven't had a scar
in a thousand years!

37:53.012 --> 37:55.102
You'll live, and
more importantly,

37:55.103 --> 37:58.538
Davina will feel
indebted to you.

37:58.539 --> 37:59.940
She will seek you
out to apologize

37:59.941 --> 38:01.108
for what she perceives as

38:01.109 --> 38:03.710
an attack she caused
as I planned.

38:03.711 --> 38:06.858
Well, I've had enough
of your plans.

38:06.859 --> 38:08.448
You stick me in this body,

38:08.449 --> 38:11.218
you force me to sneak around
like some common toady.

38:11.219 --> 38:13.086
If this is the grand new life
that you planned for me,

38:13.087 --> 38:14.824
then you can have it back!

38:14.825 --> 38:20.694
You are here by my grace, and
you will remain by my grace.

38:20.695 --> 38:22.523
Have I made myself clear?

38:22.524 --> 38:23.935
Yes, yes.

38:45.418 --> 38:47.987
Your brother was in the
attic during the attack.

38:47.988 --> 38:50.924
Finn, tell him what you saw.

38:50.925 --> 38:55.323
The door was open,
the room was empty.

38:55.324 --> 39:02.235
So how did Davina tear apart
a pack of vicious wolves?

39:02.236 --> 39:03.436
She must have had
this weapon with her.

39:03.437 --> 39:08.875
What is it... A dark
object, a book of spells?

39:08.876 --> 39:13.079
Well, I wish I knew.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.948
I was knocked out
during the attack.

39:15.949 --> 39:18.406
I never saw a thing.

39:42.980 --> 39:46.278
Let me guess.
Davina's nowhere to be found.

39:46.279 --> 39:49.482
She wasn't in the attic, wasn't
anywhere near the Lycee.

39:49.483 --> 39:50.850
I have people looking
all over this city.

39:50.851 --> 39:52.518
She is gone.

39:52.519 --> 39:54.453
No doubt to protect Mikael
while he recovers

39:54.454 --> 39:56.801
from the wounds he sustained.

39:56.802 --> 40:01.660
She's scared.
What do you expect?

40:01.661 --> 40:04.897
If I discover that you had
even the slightest suspicion

40:04.898 --> 40:06.498
that she brought father back...

40:06.499 --> 40:10.035
Yeah. What?
You gonna threaten me, my people?

40:10.036 --> 40:11.837
I mean, get in line.
The witches hate us,

40:11.838 --> 40:13.839
the wolves can kill us
any time they like.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.407
I can't even go into the quarter

40:15.408 --> 40:18.544
without risking my damn life,
and I used to run the quarter,

40:18.545 --> 40:23.582
and now Mikael's back, the
vampire who hunts vampires.

40:23.583 --> 40:26.552
You really think that
works in my favor?

40:26.553 --> 40:28.153
You want my help finding Davina.

40:28.154 --> 40:30.209
I need to know where you stand.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.457
Now Klaus is on team wolf.

40:32.458 --> 40:33.926
What are you?

40:33.927 --> 40:35.327
I don't do teams.

40:35.328 --> 40:37.629
I'm sorry, but that's
not an option.

40:37.630 --> 40:39.431
See, you're an original.

40:39.432 --> 40:41.433
Every vampire that's
ever been sired

40:41.434 --> 40:45.037
is an extension of you
and your family.

40:45.038 --> 40:46.605
Now you can walk away from that

40:46.606 --> 40:48.774
and side with Klaus
and the wolves,

40:48.775 --> 40:53.751
but you're not one of them,
and you never will be.

40:53.867 --> 40:56.469
You want allies, right?

40:56.470 --> 40:59.017
Look around.
This is ground zero

40:59.018 --> 41:01.086
for a new vampire community.

41:01.087 --> 41:03.351
Now you may think that
you're better than us,

41:03.352 --> 41:05.423
but we're all you got.

41:05.424 --> 41:07.125
And why would I play benefactor

41:07.126 --> 41:09.832
to a collection
of lost children?

41:09.833 --> 41:11.730
That's right.

41:11.731 --> 41:13.628
You never were
any good with children,

41:13.629 --> 41:18.109
but like it or not,
vampires exist because of you.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.990
And these folks are
gonna need your help.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.620
Her name's Gia.

41:35.621 --> 41:38.089
I fed her my blood
a few hours ago.

41:38.090 --> 41:41.466
When she wakes up,
she's gonna need a mentor.

41:44.596 --> 41:47.698
I hope that you do better
with her than you did with me.
