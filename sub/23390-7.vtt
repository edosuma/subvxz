00:11.040 --> 00:13.400
DONATELLA: It's only a rough idea.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.200
DESIGNER: And what is the idea?

00:16.210 --> 00:21.040
I believe, for a woman,
a dress is a weapon

00:21.050 --> 00:23.580
to get what she wants.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.110
Perhaps we could add steel?

00:26.120 --> 00:27.390
Let me see that.

00:32.509 --> 00:33.930
There you go.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.450
Hmm.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.450
Gianni will get this.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.349
Is no one going to talk about it?

01:04.360 --> 01:06.950
No one wants to say
what is wrong with him.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.170
No one even admits
there's anything wrong.

01:21.210 --> 01:22.670

01:24.680 --> 01:26.040
Mine?

01:26.580 --> 01:27.940
These are not your sketches.

01:28.530 --> 01:30.270
No, my idea is there.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.060
A dress as a weapon.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.990
What are you?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.490
Are you a designer?

01:44.500 --> 01:47.160
No, what are you? What are you?
Are you a collector

01:47.170 --> 01:48.590
of other people's ideas?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.480
- Call me what you want.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:50.490 --> 01:52.510
Tell me. How do you call yourself?

01:52.520 --> 01:55.070
I assist you the best that I can.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.370
You have the opportunity to be great

01:58.380 --> 02:00.560
and you choose to assist.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.800
No. None of us chose
this situation, Gianni.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.700
- (SCOFFS)
- Gianni, maybe you should rest.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.410
I won't talk to you
when you are like this.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.419
No, this is how I talk.
And if you don't like it,

02:10.430 --> 02:12.220
good, we never talk again.

02:12.230 --> 02:14.650
Gianni, I know why you are angry
and I am angry, too,

02:14.660 --> 02:17.160
- but it's not my fault!
- I'm sick.

02:17.170 --> 02:21.210
We have to face it...
because I cannot hide it.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.700
What do you want from me?

02:31.290 --> 02:32.610
I want everything.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.980
You have it all.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.880
I give you all.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.760
Then it's not enough.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.140
It's not enough.

02:42.030 --> 02:43.230
Sorry.

and bring me coffee,

02:49.430 --> 02:52.970
(MUFFLED): and bring me espresso,
and maybe arrange some flowers!

03:10.890 --> 03:13.080
What?

03:13.090 --> 03:16.980
I'm not afraid of your temper.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.390
She's not ready.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.120
Go apologize to her.

03:21.130 --> 03:22.960
Don't have time to be kind.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.140
You don't have time to be cruel.

03:47.090 --> 03:50.080
I can't sketch.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.820
I just can't.

03:51.830 --> 03:54.380
- Neither can I.
- You're just saying that.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.760
No, it's true.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.530
Ask any designer.

03:58.540 --> 04:01.790
It's not the quality of the sketch.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.530
It's the quality of the idea.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.030
I'm scared.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.380
I know.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.980
Pretending to be bold is not enough.

04:15.050 --> 04:18.980
I'm not asking you to pretend.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.779
I'm asking you to grow.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.780
Into what?

04:22.790 --> 04:24.830
Into you?

04:35.170 --> 04:39.230
We're going to design a dress together.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.700
Something new.

04:42.710 --> 04:45.820
Just you and I.
We're going to work together

04:45.840 --> 04:48.540
as if it were the last dress
I'll ever make.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.680
Don't talk like that, please.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.320
I have to because soon
it will be just you.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.340
All of this will rest on you.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.220
This company is you. It's not me.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.100
Mm-mm.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.500
You have to make it yours.

05:13.510 --> 05:15.340
You have to take it.

05:15.350 --> 05:17.080
You have to own it.

05:20.250 --> 05:25.550
This dress you want us
to make together...

05:25.560 --> 05:28.180
what do you want to achieve?

05:29.270 --> 05:31.350

Does it ever bother you?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.080
What?

06:58.550 --> 07:02.270
That the customers only know you
as that helpful man.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.950
Does it bother you?

The money's fine for me.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.790
I wasn't thinking about myself.
I was thinking about my mom.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.540
Is your dad still sending money?

07:28.920 --> 07:30.060
No.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.410
He's gone.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.220
You need a plan.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.880
No more magazines.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.140
<i>Vogue</i> is not a plan.

07:39.690 --> 07:42.860
I didn't get all this by being idle.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.340
Yes, Mr. Mercado.

08:17.070 --> 08:20.880
It was half the price and the
same flavor as the Häagen-Dazs.

08:29.810 --> 08:33.820
Why do you have to get so upset
about a silly thing like ice cream?

08:33.830 --> 08:36.070
Because I want the best!

08:36.950 --> 08:40.419
Well, who says that German stuff
is the best, anyway?

08:40.429 --> 08:42.190
It's not even German, Mom.

08:42.710 --> 08:45.740
It's just a name that they made
up to make it sound special.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.220
Ha, well, a made-up name, there you go.

08:49.230 --> 08:51.150

08:51.160 --> 08:53.220
his parents came from Poland,
but he lived in Brooklyn,

08:53.240 --> 08:55.490
but he wanted the brand to sound Danish

08:55.510 --> 08:57.520
because the Danes helped out
the Jews in World War II.

08:57.540 --> 09:00.950
It's even why there's a map
of Denmark on the early cartons.

09:02.630 --> 09:04.930

- You're not.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.720

being told I don't exist.

He-he's been assigned

10:38.500 --> 10:40.350

45:25.330 --> 45:28.080
She was suicidal, she-she tried
to... kill herself,

and she'd cut her wrists,
and showed me the scars.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.250

You just... you say what it is,
and I'll do it.

47:32.180 --> 47:34.400
I'll do anything, just, uh...

47:34.880 --> 47:36.210
don't leave me here alone.

47:36.220 --> 47:38.040
- Not all alone.
- Stop, stop.

47:38.050 --> 47:39.910
- What are you doing?
- Let me talk to Signor Versace.

47:39.920 --> 47:41.700
- Just stop. I can...
- He'll understand.

47:41.710 --> 47:43.420
He's Italian and I'm Italian.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.890
He understands family, yeah?
Let me talk to him and...

47:45.900 --> 47:47.330
No, you're not gonna talk to anybody...

47:47.340 --> 47:49.770
Well, just a few minutes
of his time, Andrew. Huh?

47:49.790 --> 47:51.590
He's understanding, he's a kind man,

47:51.610 --> 47:53.790
he's a decent man, he's a good man.

47:53.800 --> 47:56.930
And if he says no, well, then,
of course, I'll understand,

47:56.940 --> 47:59.530
but you need to let me try.

47:59.540 --> 48:02.030
- Why not let me try?
- No! Stop it!

48:02.040 --> 48:03.130
Oh...

48:03.140 --> 48:05.030
(GASPS)

48:05.470 --> 48:07.370
(CRIES)

48:11.990 --> 48:13.490
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

48:19.790 --> 48:23.000
DOCTOR: Your shoulder blade
is fractured, Ms. Cunanan.

48:24.730 --> 48:27.230
It's a very serious injury.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.790
Can I ask... how this happened?

48:41.630 --> 48:43.740
It was an accident.

48:44.450 --> 48:46.610
My son found me.

48:47.300 --> 48:49.630
He called the ambulance.

48:50.420 --> 48:53.150
He's a good boy.

48:53.160 --> 48:55.490
He's always been a good boy.

49:00.970 --> 49:02.870
DONATELLA: Morning.

49:09.310 --> 49:11.210
Mm-hmm.

49:16.720 --> 49:19.430
I need to speak with all of you.

49:28.730 --> 49:31.810
So... my brother is sick.

49:31.820 --> 49:33.390
You all know this.

49:35.010 --> 49:39.290
Gianni is suffering
a rare form of ear cancer.

49:40.260 --> 49:43.630
And he decided to go to Miami and rest.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.960
While he is recovering,

49:48.880 --> 49:52.240
I will be taking care
of the day-to-day operations.

49:52.250 --> 49:55.690
And he will be communicating through me.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.050
My brother is stubborn. (CHUCKLES)

50:03.060 --> 50:04.490
Don't forget that.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.720
He's stubborn about life.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.920
And he will beat this illness.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.760
He loves every one of you.

50:12.680 --> 50:16.000
He loves his work, he loves this place.

50:16.010 --> 50:20.100
So have no doubt
my brother will be back.

50:20.110 --> 50:25.740
In the meantime,
I am honored and humbled

50:25.750 --> 50:30.390
to take the reins of this
company while he recovers.

50:33.240 --> 50:37.950
Our last runway show was our
most talked about to date.

50:37.960 --> 50:41.520
We must be talked about,
or we are nothing.

50:41.530 --> 50:45.440
And now that Gianni's away,
we have to be even more bold,

50:45.460 --> 50:46.530
not less.

50:46.540 --> 50:48.900
We have to show
that we are strong, daring,

50:48.910 --> 50:50.870
that we are relevant.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.200
And that this house will survive.

50:53.210 --> 50:56.280
No matter what, it will.

51:26.360 --> 51:28.360
Be very careful with that.

51:34.610 --> 51:39.970
Andrew, I don't have enough
stuff to fill a place this big.

51:39.990 --> 51:41.480
Don't worry.

51:41.590 --> 51:45.060
I am gonna make this
the most beautiful home

51:45.070 --> 51:46.600
you have ever lived in.

51:48.580 --> 51:51.690
We'll be very happy here.

51:51.700 --> 51:53.300
NORMAN: Okay.

51:54.020 --> 51:56.270
Let me show you the terrace.

52:05.330 --> 52:08.740
Oh, if they could see me now.

52:08.750 --> 52:10.350
Who?

52:12.110 --> 52:14.000
Everyone.

52:17.540 --> 52:20.800
