WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:13.180
Hey, is his stick

00:09.426 --> 00:13.180
bigger than my stick?

00:13.221 --> 00:15.349
I don't know.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.349
They're just sticks.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.600
Yeah,

00:16.642 --> 00:19.561
but why does he get

00:16.642 --> 00:19.561
the better stick?

00:20.562 --> 00:24.399
I always get

00:20.562 --> 00:24.399
the crappy sticks.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.819
Why is everything

00:24.441 --> 00:26.819
of mine so lame?

00:26.861 --> 00:29.571
I never have anything nice.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.657
My life sucks!

Give me that.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.084
we need a babysitter.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.796
Yeah. Dad's convention

01:25.126 --> 01:27.796
is only for two days.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.840
How can you

01:27.838 --> 01:29.840
not trust us?

01:30.674 --> 01:32.300
Well, it's

01:30.674 --> 01:32.300
still not fair.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.013
I trust you to be on your own.

01:36.055 --> 01:38.473
Babysitter's not going

01:36.055 --> 01:38.473

Don't do anything.

Honey, let's roll.

01:46.147 --> 01:50.151
The meet-and-greet's at 6:30,

01:46.147 --> 01:50.151
and I don't want to be late.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.076
Bye-bye.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.494
See what happens?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.663
We told her

01:59.536 --> 02:01.663
we didn't want a babysitter,

02:01.705 --> 02:02.915
and she didn't listen.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.125
Now someone innocent

02:02.957 --> 02:05.125
has to suffer.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.179
What's that?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.140
It's the cesspool.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.851
We have a pool?

02:20.181 --> 02:22.851
It's the sewage from the house.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.686
It flows into this pit

02:22.893 --> 02:24.686
and is decomposed

02:24.728 --> 02:26.229
by anaerobic bacteria.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.273
Hurry up. It stinks.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.530
Nice.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.950
Come on, she's going

02:35.572 --> 02:37.950
to be here any second.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.201
Sorry. I had to put

02:37.992 --> 02:40.201
the "lemonade"

02:40.243 --> 02:42.746
in the refrigerator.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.725
Maybe we

03:00.430 --> 03:03.725
scared her off.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.795
Hi, guys. I'm Patty.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.215
I'm your babysitter.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.344
Uh... will you

03:36.299 --> 03:39.344
excuse us for a second?

03:55.861 --> 03:59.280
Gee, I sure hope Barbara and Tom

03:55.861 --> 03:59.280
can make it this year.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.449
They are such a fun couple.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.036
Well, I'm sure Jack Keneally

04:01.491 --> 04:04.036
will be there.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.287
Oh, honey, why don't you just

04:04.078 --> 04:06.287
say something to him

04:06.329 --> 04:07.873
instead of stewing about it?

04:07.915 --> 04:10.000
I mean, talking to me

04:07.915 --> 04:10.000
is not going to solve anything,

04:10.042 --> 04:11.668
and it's obviously

04:10.042 --> 04:11.668
just eating away at you.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.628
I'm over that.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.296
No, you are not.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.966
It's all you ever talk about

04:15.338 --> 04:17.966
whenever we go to this thing--

04:18.008 --> 04:19.342
how Keneally

04:18.008 --> 04:19.342
stole your idea

04:19.384 --> 04:23.097
to improve efficiency

04:19.384 --> 04:23.097
by four percent on the R8-698.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.306
Blah, blah,

04:23.138 --> 04:25.306
blah, blah, blah.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.307
Honey, you're obsessed.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.810
I am not obsessed.

04:28.852 --> 04:33.440
I just hate that smug look

04:28.852 --> 04:33.440
that he always gives me.

04:33.481 --> 04:37.277
And those beady little eyes.

04:33.481 --> 04:37.277
(chuckles)

04:38.612 --> 04:39.863
I ever tell you

04:38.612 --> 04:39.863
the story about

04:39.905 --> 04:41.322
how he finagled

04:39.905 --> 04:41.322
his parking spot?

04:41.364 --> 04:43.324
Yeah, about a thousand times,

04:41.364 --> 04:43.324
but it doesn't matter

04:43.366 --> 04:45.077
because I'm sure you're

04:43.366 --> 04:45.077
going to tell me again.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.328
Okay, first, he was assigned

04:45.119 --> 04:47.328
a space in "C" lot, all right?

04:47.370 --> 04:48.830
But that wasn't

04:47.370 --> 04:48.830
good enough for him.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.040
Not for Keneally! No...

04:50.082 --> 04:53.877
So, what do you guys want

04:50.082 --> 04:53.877
for a snack?

04:55.129 --> 04:56.046
Excuse me?

04:56.088 --> 04:57.338
Well, I can make you popcorn

04:57.380 --> 04:58.924
or bake us some

04:57.380 --> 04:58.924
chocolate chip cookies.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.635
But Mom says

04:58.966 --> 05:01.635
the oven doesn't work.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.596
You guys are just so cute!

05:04.638 --> 05:06.890

05:07.432 --> 05:09.350
Hello.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.602
Malcolm, how's it going?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.937
Listen, I need you

05:10.644 --> 05:11.937
to do me a favor.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.105
There's 200 or 300 fake I.D.s

05:13.147 --> 05:14.856
hidden behind

05:13.147 --> 05:14.856
the washing machine.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.150
Now, with Mom gone,

05:16.191 --> 05:17.901
it's safe to transfer them

05:16.191 --> 05:17.901
to the garage.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.237
Francis, I really

05:17.943 --> 05:20.237
can't do that right now.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.905
What?

05:20.279 --> 05:21.905
What are you talking about?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.241
Francis?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.241
Is that Francis?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.367
Tell him it's Patty Henderson

05:24.283 --> 05:26.367
from eighth grade algebra.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.495
Patty Henderson

05:26.409 --> 05:28.495
says hi.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.830
Oh, my God!

05:29.871 --> 05:31.748
Patty Henderson

05:29.871 --> 05:31.748
is your babysitter?

05:31.790 --> 05:32.874
Here, let me talk to him.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.251
Don't let her...

05:34.293 --> 05:34.835
Hi.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.377
Hi, Patty.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.088
Can't believe

05:36.419 --> 05:38.088
I'm talking to you.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.339
You probably

05:38.130 --> 05:40.339
don't even remember me.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.385
Hi, Francis.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.387
Hi, Patty.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.682
(school bell ringing)

05:48.723 --> 05:50.433
Yeah, of course I remember you.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.977
How's it...? What's that, Joe?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.312
You got to use the phone?

05:53.352 --> 05:55.772
I'm sorry, Patty.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.772
I got to go. Bye.

05:55.814 --> 05:56.857
(sighs)

05:56.898 --> 05:58.399
Francis is so great.

05:58.441 --> 06:02.487
He was the only boy

05:58.441 --> 06:02.487
who was ever nice to me.

06:03.947 --> 06:07.201
Come on, guys,

06:03.947 --> 06:07.201
she's not that fat.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.870
(sighs)

06:07.242 --> 06:09.870
What a sweetheart.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.080
And so cute.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.916
Yeah. I'm a lot

06:12.122 --> 06:14.916
like him.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.960
Tell you what.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.960
Before dinner, why don't we all

06:17.002 --> 06:18.419
straighten up the house

06:17.002 --> 06:18.419
together?

06:18.461 --> 06:19.420
Good idea!

06:18.461 --> 06:19.420
Sure!

06:19.462 --> 06:21.380
Great!

06:22.841 --> 06:25.384
(woman speaking indistinctly

06:22.841 --> 06:25.384
over P.A.)

06:40.483 --> 06:43.195
Look. I think they're

06:40.483 --> 06:43.195
giving away free beach towels

06:43.237 --> 06:44.988
at the QVHLPPS booth.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.988
BARBARA: Yoo-hoo!

06:45.030 --> 06:47.699
Hey, there's

06:45.030 --> 06:47.699
Barbara and Tom.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.452
And there's Keneally.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.954
Oh, for God's sake, Hal.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.581
You've got

06:52.996 --> 06:54.581
to get over this.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.042
Just go over there

06:54.622 --> 06:57.042
and talk to him.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.378
Just clear the air.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.424
Okay, okay. Going.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.977
(both grunting)

07:27.030 --> 07:29.490
What do you do when you've got

07:27.030 --> 07:29.490
an incredible woman

07:29.532 --> 07:30.658
in your bedroom?

07:30.700 --> 07:35.622
En... chan... te.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.083
It's the best

07:35.663 --> 07:38.083
I could come up with

07:38.125 --> 07:40.001
given the parameters.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.502
Well, it's great

07:40.043 --> 07:41.502
meeting you guys.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.213
Would you like anything?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.300
They're fine.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.219
Okay. Well, have fun.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.514
She's a trophy

07:50.220 --> 07:53.514
babysitter.

07:53.556 --> 07:57.227
Tuck me... in.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.188
I wonder if she knows

07:57.269 --> 08:00.188
how to keep kosher.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.856
REESE:

08:00.230 --> 08:01.856
What is wrong with you?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.984
How can you do this?

08:04.025 --> 08:05.526
What are you

08:04.025 --> 08:05.526
talking about?

08:05.568 --> 08:07.904
You invited them over

08:05.568 --> 08:07.904
here to gawk at Patty

08:07.946 --> 08:09.781
like she's some piece of meat?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.075
Mom and Dad paid

08:09.823 --> 08:12.075
good money for her.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.077
She's ours!

08:12.117 --> 08:14.077
We're leaving.

08:14.119 --> 08:17.622
He's not going to do anything

08:14.119 --> 08:17.622
with her in the house.

08:17.664 --> 08:21.460
Wow! She's like kryptonite.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.004
So... this is Reesie's blankie?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.464
It's darling.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.591
I guess suddenly there's

08:25.505 --> 08:28.591
no such thing as tomorrow.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.551
All I have are singles. Just...

08:30.593 --> 08:32.471
(sniffles)

08:32.512 --> 08:34.597
I always felt so sorry

08:32.512 --> 08:34.597
for Patty.

08:34.639 --> 08:38.518
And she had this

08:34.639 --> 08:38.518
wild crush on me.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.562
She used to follow me around,

08:38.559 --> 08:41.562
waddling,

08:41.604 --> 08:43.564
her big arms jiggling.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.899
I mean, she was nice--

08:44.941 --> 08:46.567
I didn't want

08:44.941 --> 08:46.567
to hurt her feelings--

08:46.609 --> 08:48.528
but what are you supposed

08:46.609 --> 08:48.528
to do

08:48.569 --> 08:52.073
when somebody really gross

08:48.569 --> 08:52.073
thinks you're cute?

08:52.115 --> 08:54.117
You really got a couple

08:52.115 --> 08:54.117
of good shots in.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.910
Look, I'm just embarrassed

08:54.159 --> 08:55.910
about the whole thing.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.705
Hey, he stole

08:55.952 --> 08:58.705
your idea.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.457
How often do you

08:58.746 --> 09:00.457
come up with an idea

09:00.499 --> 09:02.583
to increase efficiency

09:00.499 --> 09:02.583
by four percent?

09:02.625 --> 09:04.585
At least you made him

09:02.625 --> 09:04.585
scream like a girl.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.463
No, that was me.

09:06.505 --> 09:07.922
I don't know

09:06.505 --> 09:07.922
what got into Hal.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.924
I've never seen him

09:07.964 --> 09:09.924
act that way before.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.926
At least, not without

09:09.966 --> 09:11.926
any provocation.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.594
Or with witnesses.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.722
Men are animals.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.766
Or so I am told.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.643
Are you drunk already?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.187
I'm not wasting

09:20.685 --> 09:22.187
any time.

09:22.229 --> 09:26.525
I got to get back to

09:22.229 --> 09:26.525
the kids in 24 hours.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.568
Lord, what an

09:26.566 --> 09:28.568
idiot I am.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.362
I mean, these are

09:28.609 --> 09:30.362
people I work with.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.114
They're going to

09:30.404 --> 09:33.114
think I'm a lunatic.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.617
(sighs) I should

09:34.199 --> 09:36.617
apologize to Keneally.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.495
BARBARA:

09:36.659 --> 09:38.495
Did you know that

09:38.537 --> 09:39.746
you can audition

09:38.537 --> 09:39.746
male strippers

09:39.787 --> 09:41.581
and you don't even

09:39.787 --> 09:41.581
have to hire them?

09:41.622 --> 09:42.957
They're not that bright.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.669
Oh, I was just going to get

09:42.999 --> 09:46.669
T-shirts for the boys, but...

09:46.711 --> 09:49.714
(both grunting)

09:53.051 --> 09:54.969
LOIS:

09:53.051 --> 09:54.969
That is enough!

09:55.011 --> 09:56.596
Let go of his hair!

09:56.637 --> 09:58.723
Hal, stop biting!

09:58.765 --> 10:00.141
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:00.183 --> 10:02.727
Oh, for God's sake,

10:00.183 --> 10:02.727
Tom, do something.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.020
I'll refill your drink.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.813
Okay.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.616
What?

10:19.702 --> 10:20.703
What are you doing?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.622
What are you doing?

10:25.750 --> 10:28.253
Here you go.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.718
Hungry?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.804
I don't know what I am.

10:37.845 --> 10:38.972
Dewey!

10:39.013 --> 10:40.640
Come on, guys, eat.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.645
These potatoes

10:43.477 --> 10:45.645
are heavenly.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.439
Thank you.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.233
So, yesterday,

10:48.482 --> 10:50.233
in my gifted class--

10:50.275 --> 10:51.985
I'm not bragging

10:50.275 --> 10:51.985
that I'm gifted,

10:52.026 --> 10:53.694
that's just what

10:52.026 --> 10:53.694
they call the class--

10:53.736 --> 10:56.364
we studied bovine

10:53.736 --> 10:56.364
spongiform encephalitis.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.657
It's mad cow disease.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.494
It started because they

10:57.698 --> 11:00.494
were grinding up dead cows

11:00.535 --> 11:02.287
to feed them

11:00.535 --> 11:02.287
to the other cows.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.165
Basically, the prions

11:02.329 --> 11:05.165
turn their brains into soup

11:05.206 --> 11:06.666
right in their skulls.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.793
It's very similar

11:07.708 --> 11:08.793
to a disease

11:08.835 --> 11:10.711
that afflicted a tribe

11:08.835 --> 11:10.711
of cannibals

11:10.753 --> 11:11.754
because they feasted

11:11.796 --> 11:14.341
on their

11:11.796 --> 11:14.341
victims' brains.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.763
Hey, Patty,

11:19.012 --> 11:20.763
(clears throat)

11:20.805 --> 11:22.015
I have a trick for you.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.224
What's your address?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.101
Um, 531 North Canton.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.102
What's your

11:25.143 --> 11:26.102
favorite color?

11:26.144 --> 11:27.770
I don't know. Blue, I guess.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.730
Mine, too.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.734
(gulping air)

11:33.776 --> 11:36.988
(deep, burping voice):

11:33.776 --> 11:36.988
Hello, Patty Henderson

11:33.776 --> 11:36.988
of 531 North Canton

11:37.030 --> 11:39.115
whose favorite color

11:37.030 --> 11:39.115
is blue just like...

11:39.157 --> 11:40.908
(coughing)

11:44.871 --> 11:47.207
I can dance.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.207
Want me to show you?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.543
Okay.

I don't know.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.581
Just shut up.

12:27.622 --> 12:31.292
(Patty and Dewey laughing

12:27.622 --> 12:31.292
in distance)

12:36.923 --> 12:38.633
All right!

12:40.927 --> 12:42.178
Oh!

12:42.220 --> 12:43.930
I'll get it.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.099
Keeps going

12:43.971 --> 12:46.099
under the bed.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.392
Oh, there it is.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.810
Here, let me just

12:47.434 --> 12:49.810
wiggle it a little more.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.062
Oh, my God, I just

12:51.104 --> 12:52.855
pushed it in

12:51.104 --> 12:52.855
even farther.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.814
Oh, got it.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.775
Oh, wait, what's this?

13:09.038 --> 13:11.958
Okay. Now you're all

13:09.038 --> 13:11.958
squeaky clean.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.835
Now go put on your pajamas.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.337
(laughs)

13:19.882 --> 13:21.384
Hi, guys.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.303
All right,

13:21.426 --> 13:23.303
drop the cute stuff.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.179
What cute stuff?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.140
You! Standing there

13:25.221 --> 13:27.140
with your big eyes

13:27.181 --> 13:28.725
and your dopey voice.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.893
I have to resist

13:28.767 --> 13:30.893
hugging you myself.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.353
I'm not doing anything.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.355
Yeah? Then what's that?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.441
Nothing.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.112
You were going

13:38.610 --> 13:41.112
to make her a card?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.113
No.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.823
You like glitter, Dewey?

13:47.201 --> 13:49.788
Dewey?

13:50.413 --> 13:51.748
This is the way he is.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.916
He's a walking

13:51.790 --> 13:53.916
disaster area.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.251
(sighs)

13:55.293 --> 13:57.378
Guess who needs another bath?

13:57.962 --> 14:00.799
Come on, you.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.973
Now, not so much ice

14:06.929 --> 14:08.973
this time.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.849
I'm not cold.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.772
Hey, why don't you pay for

14:12.977 --> 14:15.772
dinner, since we got parking.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.232
You're taking advantage of me

14:15.814 --> 14:18.232
because I'm drunk?

14:18.274 --> 14:19.776
Yeah.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.861
I wish he would.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.655
Okay.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.906
I hope you're proud

14:23.697 --> 14:25.906
of yourself.

14:25.948 --> 14:26.907
I can't help it.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.493
I don't know what it is.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.911
It's like the guy gives off

14:28.535 --> 14:30.911
some kind of scent.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.580
The hair on the back

14:30.953 --> 14:32.580
of my neck stands up,

14:32.622 --> 14:33.914
and I want to tear him apart.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.792
I would never have the courage

14:33.956 --> 14:35.792
to do what Hal did.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.918
Oh, sure, occasionally

14:35.834 --> 14:37.918
I'll yell at someone.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.962
It's always with

14:37.960 --> 14:39.962
the car window rolled up.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.590
Can I just say

14:40.004 --> 14:42.590
thank you?

14:42.632 --> 14:44.884
Tom, don't encourage him.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.886
I'm just saying, I'd do

14:44.925 --> 14:46.886
what Hal did if I could.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.013
But you can't

14:46.927 --> 14:49.013
because you're a coward.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.057
That's my point.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.394
And I've got Mr. Sorenson

14:52.851 --> 14:54.394
for math.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.936
Do you think that guy

14:54.435 --> 14:55.936
ever changes his pants?

14:55.978 --> 14:56.979
'Cause I don't think so.

14:57.021 --> 14:57.980
Really?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
Listen to me rambling

14:58.022 --> 14:59.524
on and on.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.401
I have completely

14:59.566 --> 15:01.401
lost track of time.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.944
Uh, this call? About 97 minutes.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
It's been so great

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
talking to you.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.741
Yeah, yeah, you, too.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.950
You were always so nice to me.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.994
Ah, well, you deserve it,

15:09.992 --> 15:11.994
you know.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.121
You're a nice person.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.498
I'm wearing one of your shirts.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.917
I was going to sleep

15:15.540 --> 15:17.917
in it tonight.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.044
I hope you don't mind.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.255
No, no.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.716
Anyway, um...

15:24.758 --> 15:26.967
I-I don't know

15:24.758 --> 15:26.967
quite how to say this,

15:27.009 --> 15:29.011
so I'm just going to say it.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.097
I think you're really special.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.724
And, um, well...

15:32.766 --> 15:35.727
I heard you were going to be

15:32.766 --> 15:35.727
home in a couple of weeks,

15:35.769 --> 15:37.854
and, well, my parents are

15:35.769 --> 15:37.854
going to be out of town,

15:37.896 --> 15:40.356
and I thought maybe

15:37.896 --> 15:40.356
you could come over

15:40.398 --> 15:43.984
and we could... you know.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.986
Listen, Patty,

15:44.026 --> 15:45.986
I have to say this,

15:46.028 --> 15:48.989
and I am sorry,

15:46.028 --> 15:48.989
but I don't want to lead you on.

15:49.031 --> 15:53.578
I am so not physically

15:49.031 --> 15:53.578
attracted to you.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.581
Like, at all.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.250
I think of you as a friend.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.877
Uh-huh.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.087
Oh, Patty, see,

16:00.919 --> 16:03.087
now I hurt your feelings.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.006
I know this may be really hard

16:03.129 --> 16:06.006
for you to believe,

16:06.048 --> 16:07.592
but there is someone out there

16:07.634 --> 16:09.886
who will find you

16:07.634 --> 16:09.886
physically attractive.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.012
And you'll find him,

16:09.928 --> 16:12.012
and when you do...

16:12.054 --> 16:13.890
Look, I get it, Francis.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.309
Okay, someone's out there

16:13.932 --> 16:16.309
for me, and it's not you!

16:16.350 --> 16:18.185
That's the spirit.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.397
(sighs)

16:21.439 --> 16:23.566
You had to do it, man.

16:23.608 --> 16:27.153
It's tough when you're

16:23.608 --> 16:27.153
their one shot at happiness.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.030
This is going to send her

16:27.194 --> 16:30.030
straight to the fridge.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.493
Hey, Patty, want to play

16:30.072 --> 16:33.493
video hockey?

16:33.534 --> 16:36.162
Um, not right now.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.162
(sniffles)

16:39.081 --> 16:41.000
Hey, where are you going?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.377
To find out what's wrong

16:41.041 --> 16:43.377
and make her feel better.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.630
No. I'll go find out what's

16:43.419 --> 16:45.630
wrong and make her feel better.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.173
You'll just make her

16:45.672 --> 16:47.173
more upset.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.633
I happen

16:47.214 --> 16:48.633
to be sensitive.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.718
You're stupid

16:48.675 --> 16:50.718
and a creep.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.012
I'll kick your ass!

16:54.263 --> 16:55.974
Say I can make her feel better!

16:56.015 --> 16:57.057
No!

16:57.099 --> 16:58.309

He's cute.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.785
I hate him for being cute.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.331
I don't feel so good.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.958
Maybe it was the oysters.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.418
Uh-huh. Hal, do you have the...

17:24.460 --> 17:27.380
Where's Hal?

17:27.421 --> 17:30.008
(grunting, shouting)

17:31.801 --> 17:34.094
I used to have

17:31.801 --> 17:34.094
a Rottweiler like this.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.889
Excuse me.

17:54.281 --> 17:58.118
I can't believe she's sleeping

17:54.281 --> 17:58.118
in the bed right down the hall.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.079
I can't sleep.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.460
He's not that cute.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.254
(screaming)

18:11.424 --> 18:13.133
What's the matter?

18:13.175 --> 18:14.218
I'm scared.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.470
I had a nightmare.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.470
(sniffling)

18:16.512 --> 18:17.847
Oh, you poor baby.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.099
Want to sleep with me?

18:22.184 --> 18:24.144
Okay, come on.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.105
All righty.

18:26.940 --> 18:30.068
(whimpering softly)

18:34.321 --> 18:36.156
I don't believe it.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.618
I'm supposed to be the genius,

18:36.198 --> 18:38.618
and I'm being outsmarted

18:38.659 --> 18:41.037
by a kid who can't even

18:38.659 --> 18:41.037
tie his own shoes.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.663
We can't let him get

18:41.079 --> 18:42.663
away with this.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.959
We're taking him down.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.046
Would you stop this, please?!

18:50.088 --> 18:53.173
You are humiliating me

18:50.088 --> 18:53.173
in front of my friends!

18:53.215 --> 18:54.341
(Barbara retching)

18:54.383 --> 18:57.095
I'm okay.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.054
(retching)

18:58.096 --> 18:59.305
You are both middle-aged men.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.934
You are too old and too weak

18:59.346 --> 19:02.934
to accomplish anything here!

19:02.976 --> 19:05.185
It's too late!

19:02.976 --> 19:05.185
Something snapped!

19:05.227 --> 19:07.480
I'm way past the point

19:05.227 --> 19:07.480
of no return.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.108
We're talking primal

19:07.521 --> 19:10.108
animal urges!

19:10.149 --> 19:14.112
I'm going to let nature

19:10.149 --> 19:14.112
take its course and kill him!

19:18.407 --> 19:20.118
In 30 seconds,

19:20.159 --> 19:23.663
I am going to instruct

19:20.159 --> 19:23.663
these men to let you go.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.705
Thank you, Lois. Thank you.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.208
And then you will have a choice.

19:28.250 --> 19:32.338
You can indulge your

19:28.250 --> 19:32.338
primal urges with him, or...

19:34.007 --> 19:36.676
...you can come back

19:34.007 --> 19:36.676
to the motel

19:36.717 --> 19:39.178
and indulge your primal urges

19:36.717 --> 19:39.178
with me.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.732
Don't trivialize my anger, Lois!

19:53.526 --> 19:54.944
I mean, there are some things

19:54.986 --> 19:57.864
that you just don't try

19:54.986 --> 19:57.864
to talk people out of.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.497
I have a legitimate

20:04.037 --> 20:06.497
situation here.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.207
I know, baby.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.062
(shouting)

20:48.497 --> 20:50.290
(sighs)

20:50.332 --> 20:51.333
It's working.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.585
Okay, I'll hold him,

20:52.626 --> 20:54.087
you put the tape

20:52.626 --> 20:54.087
over his mouth.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.255
Then we'll take him

20:54.128 --> 20:56.255
to the garage.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.383
Where did he go?

21:01.343 --> 21:02.636
There he is.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.471
Come to papa.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.814
He locked us out!

21:13.856 --> 21:15.775
Dewey, come to bed.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.277
Okay.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.782
Great.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.409
What are we supposed

21:22.823 --> 21:25.409
to do now?

21:28.370 --> 21:29.997
(screams)

21:30.039 --> 21:31.249
(liquid sloshing)

21:31.290 --> 21:34.460
Oh, my God,

21:31.290 --> 21:34.460
what is this stuff?!

21:34.501 --> 21:37.296
Well, at least the night

21:34.501 --> 21:37.296
wasn't a total loss.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.966
Oh, geez.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.966
Oh, what is that?
