WEBVTT

00:14.557 --> 00:18.675
It's rude to stare, you know?

00:18.769 --> 00:25.516
I'm sorry. This is just so incredibly
weird for me. You have no idea.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.441
--Why weird?
--Because...

00:27.528 --> 00:34.024
you're the first person I've ever
woken up next to that... isn't dead.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.609
Well, if it's any consolation,
I can now officially say they

00:36.704 --> 00:39.320
died with a smile on their face.

00:40.875 --> 00:45.960
Sorry, I shouldn't joke
about that. Are you okay?

00:46.047 --> 00:48.333
It's hard to complain.

00:48.424 --> 00:51.962
I'm healed in record
time because of you.

00:52.053 --> 00:55.966
Hey, would sex with any Fae
give me this big of a hit?

00:56.057 --> 00:59.800
Well, I like to think that I bring a
little something special to the table.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.475
Oh.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.974
Why, you going to find out?

01:04.065 --> 01:06.397
Not any time soon.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.235
Forget me. How are you feeling?

01:13.616 --> 01:18.656
ljust feel like I've run a very
long, very dirty marathon.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.577
You certainly leave your mark on a man.

01:20.665 --> 01:23.077
Well, I never said that
I would be gentle.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.249
Neither did I, as I recall.

01:25.336 --> 01:29.375
I'm all healed. Mission accomplished.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.879
So, I guess you should probably
go home or something.

01:33.970 --> 01:36.712
I guess I could get some sleep.

01:36.806 --> 01:39.889
--I do still kind of have a headache.
--Works for me.

01:52.655 --> 01:55.613
[whimpering]

02:11.382 --> 02:12.462
Ahh!

02:13.968 --> 02:16.880
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.883
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.886
My love carries a death sentence.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.093
l was lost for years,

02:25.187 --> 02:27.769
searching, while hiding,

02:27.857 --> 02:32.066
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:32.153 --> 02:37.022
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:53.049 --> 02:54.914
Toothpaste?

02:55.009 --> 02:56.795
Foot locker.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.341
Thanks.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.026
Okay.

03:29.043 --> 03:29.828
What?

03:29.919 --> 03:32.456
Looks like somebody had
an overnight guest.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.958
A gentleman caller, if you will.

03:35.049 --> 03:38.337
Will you just relax? You know
he was just here to heal me.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.635
Apparently, he healed
you all night long.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.054
Just try to grow up for
a second here, okay,

03:44.141 --> 03:45.972
and not make such a
big deal out of this.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.470
Totally.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.224
But if I was going to make a big deal,
like how big are we talking?

03:51.315 --> 03:53.397
Just--just ballpark. Are we talking--

03:53.484 --> 03:57.147
What! He's Fae. I'm just
asking for science.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.318
Hey.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.737
So, I'm going to head out.

03:59.824 --> 04:03.908
Okay. Thanks again for last night.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.905
Any time.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.449
"Any time."

04:14.255 --> 04:16.837
Kenzi. What the hell?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.540
Right. About that, l was--

04:19.635 --> 04:23.844
"Need help, no one believes you?
Bo's Private Investigation Services.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.594
Specializing in the strange and
paranormal, ten years experience,

04:27.685 --> 04:32.019
police references available..."
You can't just lie about this shit.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.222
In my defence, truth is for pussies.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.353
Do you have any idea what kind of
crackpots we're going to get with this?

04:37.445 --> 04:38.230
The kind who pay?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.026
--Kenzi, listen--
--No, you listen!

04:40.114 --> 04:42.776
We're not exactly cut
out for day jobs, Bo.

04:42.867 --> 04:45.199
I'm a thief and you're not even human.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.696
Hey, watch it.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.369
Look, I know you'd rather
be normal, but you're not.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.870
You're a freak and I dig that about you.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.700
You know you really need to
learn when to stop talking.

04:54.795 --> 04:59.209
Bo, you have skills
that can help people.

04:59.300 --> 05:03.464
People that have nowhere else to turn.
People with shiny, shiny money.

05:03.554 --> 05:07.046
Is that really so terrible?
We already have people calling.

05:07.141 --> 05:11.100
Just meet with one of them
before you decide, okay?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.352
One.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.434
l have to be honest. I can't
afford to pay you very much.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.065
All my money goes
into Gina's education.

05:22.156 --> 05:25.239
Define "all."

05:25.326 --> 05:28.739
Our rates are negotiable. First, let's
worry about whether we can help you.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.569
If you can't, I don't
know what else to do.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.451
Gina hasn't been gone long enough
for the cops to take me seriously.

05:33.542 --> 05:37.410
She's over 18, so the college is acting
like I'm some smothering parent.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.917
Well, no offence, but how
do we know you're not?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.338
Are there any signs of foul play?

05:41.425 --> 05:45.168
She just disappeared, okay,
in the middle of the night.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.254
She hasn't been to her room.
She hasn't answered her cell phone.

05:48.349 --> 05:51.637
She missed an exam this morning,
and yesterday was my birthday

05:51.727 --> 05:53.092
and she never called.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.428
Okay? None of that is like my daughter.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.263
But it is like a teenager.

05:57.358 --> 06:01.772
Gina has wanted to be in a sorority
ever since she was a little girl.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.195
Initiation is in two days and last we
talked, she was counting the minutes.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.115
She never would have left
before then, not willingly.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.113
Mrs. Ames, this doesn't
really prove anything.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.786
Look, a mother knows
when her child is in trouble.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.831
Please help me find mine.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.783
--What do you think?
--I don't know, dude.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.664
I started running away when I was ten.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.495
Sometimes, people just
don't want to be found.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.626
Well, it doesn't sound like
Gina had much to run from.

06:23.717 --> 06:29.053
Says her mom. This girl could be
pregnant, flunking out, or on drugs.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.471
I know I'd have to be
tripping to join a sorority.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.844
Still, I know how shitty it feels

06:32.935 --> 06:36.143
looking for family that
nobody will help you find.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.471
Can't hurt to look into it.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.557
We can start with what the cops know.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.812
Any one cop in particular?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.519
Why are you being
so weird about this?

06:45.614 --> 06:48.321
We had sex. It doesn't have
to mean anything more.

06:48.409 --> 06:52.402
Sex doesn't. But sleeping
over usually does.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.488
So, you go grill
"Officer Your Boyfriend"

06:55.583 --> 06:59.041
and I'll go see what I
can find out on my own.

07:07.595 --> 07:11.429
So, you're a P.|. now, huh?

07:11.515 --> 07:16.009
Yeah, it's part of Kenzi's grand
plan to commodify my freakhood.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.014
That girl worries me.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.686
It's not the worst idea, though,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.765
taking freelance work when
we need some scratch.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.522
Well, you wouldn't have to if
you pledged yourself to the Fae.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.104
You'd be cared for. The Ash
would find you a human job

07:28.198 --> 07:29.608
that also protects the Fae interests.

07:29.700 --> 07:33.784
Like yours. Membership
has its privileges, huh?

07:33.871 --> 07:36.237
--Something like that.
--Yeah, well,

07:36.332 --> 07:37.572
so does freedom.

07:37.666 --> 07:41.204
So, no missing persons reports
filed by the campus police.

07:41.295 --> 07:46.255
I did a quick check of the cold files
here, but nothing helpful here either.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.549
What about your spooky files?

07:48.636 --> 07:49.546
My what?

07:49.637 --> 07:52.754
You know--Fae crimes that
you guys have covered up.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.055
I mean, that is pretty much the
point of your day job, isn't it?

07:55.142 --> 07:58.600
Making sure that none of the
Fae stuff get into these records?

07:58.687 --> 08:01.099
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:01.190 --> 08:05.559
Which is why you did
not get this from me.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.484
It's all I could find on Locksley College.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.072
This is ten years old.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.612
Yeah, it's before my time here.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.066
This one stood out--freshman
girl disappeared winter semester.

08:14.161 --> 08:19.906
Her body was unearthed during
campus construction. It was hollow.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.740
You mean she was disembowelled?

08:21.835 --> 08:25.919
No, I mean, she was hollow.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.839
No internal organs, no incisions.

08:28.926 --> 08:32.794
It's as if her insides were
completely sucked out.

08:32.888 --> 08:36.927
Gross. So, definitely a
Fae kill then, huh?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.133
Whoever the killer
was either left town

08:39.228 --> 08:42.095
or got better at covering up his tracks,
'cause it's the only body we found.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.929
No other missing
students over the years?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.140
No more than a usual campus.

08:46.235 --> 08:49.477
Look, colleges are a transient
community by nature.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.530
If you target the right victim, it's possible
that no one will report them gone.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.984
Well, if I can't find out
anything more from here,

08:57.079 --> 08:58.944
I'll have to get on the inside.

08:59.039 --> 09:05.877
Which is why I will need just
one more itty-bitty favour.

09:05.963 --> 09:09.956
And how do you propose we
start paying off these favours?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.837
I think we can figure it out.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.303
No, don't cancel the card yet,

09:16.390 --> 09:20.850
but meanwhile, if there's any
purchasing, can you maybe alert me?

09:20.936 --> 09:23.222
Thanks so much.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.223
Hey, chica.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.726
--Yo.
--What's the word?

09:26.817 --> 09:30.560
Well, I am starting to think there may
be more to this missing persons case.

09:30.654 --> 09:31.689
Oh, yeah, why's that?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.692
Got her mom's permission
to check her financials

09:34.783 --> 09:37.024
and Gina's not just ignoring her mom.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.825
No action on her debit or credit,

09:38.912 --> 09:41.324
ditto on her data and
cell plan since Monday.

09:41.415 --> 09:45.875
So, no shopping, no texting,
no talking in 48 hours.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.498
Which makes her either
dead or over forty.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.171
Let's hope for something in between.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.168
What's all that shit?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.341
Going undercover at Gina's school.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.669
Dyson got me in as campus security.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.551
--Me too?
--Sort of.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.808
Wait, what kind of security
guard wears pink?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.725
Oh no.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.523
I hate you long time. Are you
really going to make me do this?

10:16.617 --> 10:20.701
Like you haven't done worse?
What is the problem?

10:20.788 --> 10:24.701
I can handle scary monsters,
okay, but privilege creeps me out.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.953
Well, this is the gig, so suck it up.

10:27.044 --> 10:30.286
I better get danger pay.
This is bad for my soul.

10:30.380 --> 10:34.623
Kappa Theta Xi. According to her mom,
Gina spent her final days here.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.130
You need to get in there
and find out what they know.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.711
You sure you worked a solid cover?

10:38.806 --> 10:41.422
Please, I have grifted made guys.

10:41.517 --> 10:45.226
I think I can con a few Muffys. If I must.

10:45.312 --> 10:49.476
Oh, you must. And look on the bright side--
Maybe you were right the first time.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.104
Maybe Gina's just playing hooky and
this whole thing will be over soon.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.651
Mm-hmm.

11:16.552 --> 11:18.133
Hello?

11:34.862 --> 11:37.820
[GINA screaming]

11:51.253 --> 11:54.211
Help! Somebody, help!

11:57.885 --> 12:00.126
Do you have much security
work under your belt?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.131
Some. Mostly private.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.804
Yeah, I worked that angle
for a bit. Good money.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.804
But this is a whole 'nother
kitten to kick. Never gets stale.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.477
So, how long have you been here?

12:10.564 --> 12:13.397
Longer than I care to remember,
let's just put it that way.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.644
I can tell you anything you
want to know about this place.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.193
Great. Any gossip on
the latest crimes?

12:18.280 --> 12:19.315
What kind of action am I looking at?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.648
Plenty. If you ask me, higher education
attracts a certain kind of person--

12:22.743 --> 12:26.201
spoiled brats, commies and wise-asses.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.745
They don't look so scary.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.244
Leave it to me, don't let the
pretty people fool you--

12:31.335 --> 12:34.202
this can be a pretty dangerous gig.
You run into any trouble,

12:34.296 --> 12:36.002
don't forget your Holy Trinity:

12:36.089 --> 12:38.000
Taser, your pepper
spray, your flashlight.

12:38.091 --> 12:42.505
Together, they'll get you out
of just about anything, okay?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.427
Hey, why are you taking that down?

12:44.514 --> 12:46.345
Policy. Until the police
alert us officially,

12:46.433 --> 12:47.843
the school doesn't like
us instigating panic

12:47.935 --> 12:49.675
every time some kid is late for a class.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.475
You're kidding?

12:50.520 --> 12:53.887
It's pretty tough. Feel
for the parents, though.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.893
Fortunately, almost always, these
kids show up in a week or so

12:55.984 --> 12:58.191
after some bender, no worse for wear.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.691
Well, still, shouldn't we be putting
together a detail or questioning students?

13:01.782 --> 13:06.697
Ask Dean Peretti. Ninety percent
of this job is keeping her happy.

13:06.787 --> 13:11.577
Folks, our founders may
have built on faulty ground,

13:11.667 --> 13:14.625
but our alumni are rock solid.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.043
Their generosity with our
reconstruction campaign

13:17.130 --> 13:21.874
ensures Locksley will be
here for decades to come.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.632
Here's to more Locksley success.
[applause]

13:25.722 --> 13:28.099
Thank you.
[applause]

13:33.397 --> 13:35.729
So, why are you starting
classes so late?

13:35.816 --> 13:40.105
My folks just got transferred
and I wanted to be closer to them.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.062
Well, I can't tell you how
perfect your timing is.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.442
We have a sudden opening
in our pledge class,

13:45.534 --> 13:47.946
so we're always thrilled
to meet a Kappa Legacy.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.116
When was your mom a Kappa?

13:49.204 --> 13:51.911
My grandmother, actually.
Long time ago.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.331
Poor Memaw had five
boys and her dying wish

13:54.418 --> 13:57.125
was that I continue
the Kappa tradition.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.578
Aw, sweet.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.961
Then I'm sure you must
know the Legacy handshake.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.962
Of course.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.849
[laughing]

14:16.940 --> 14:19.682
You West Coast girls are hilarious.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.360
Now, you understand that we only
take girls of the highest calibre

14:23.447 --> 14:25.358
and who've been vetted through rush.

14:25.449 --> 14:29.988
But given recent circumstances
and your pedigree,

14:30.078 --> 14:32.114
let's all welcome our newest pledge.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.866
[cheering]

14:33.957 --> 14:36.198
Oh! There's hugging.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.629
Robert, where the hell is my 10 o'clock?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.632
I think that might be me.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.463
I'm the newest member
of your security team.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.298
I just thought I'd introduce myself.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.011
Really? Why?

14:57.105 --> 14:59.847
I hear there could be
a missing student.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.977
I'm volunteering to set
up an investigation.

15:02.069 --> 15:06.028
Well, I admire your ambition,
but not its direction.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.026
Until I hear otherwise from the
police, it's wasted resources.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.403
Your students' safety
is wasted resources?

15:11.495 --> 15:15.534
May I be frank?
Professional to professional.

15:17.626 --> 15:23.337
Your job isn't just protecting students--
it's protecting the school's reputation.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.039
It's hard enough squeezing
out donations in this economy

15:26.134 --> 15:30.047
without toxic rumours
frightening them off.

15:30.138 --> 15:34.097
My lips are already chapped from
all the behind I've had to kiss.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.890
Well...

15:44.778 --> 15:47.736
What if I gave you
something better to kiss?

15:49.324 --> 15:53.533
Would you have any secrets that
you'd want to share in exchange?

15:53.620 --> 15:54.860
Like what?

15:54.955 --> 15:57.742
Like anything on that missing student?

15:57.833 --> 16:01.200
I can't say.

16:01.294 --> 16:06.755
Except what some drunken
frat boy said he saw.

16:06.842 --> 16:11.711
He said she took off running
towards the woods that night.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.263
Anything else?
Don't hold out on me now.

16:17.686 --> 16:21.270
--Dean Peretti, here are the files you--
--Knock, dammit!

16:21.356 --> 16:24.063
Out!

16:24.151 --> 16:26.984
No, no, not you.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.436
Some other time.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.993
Get me Human Resources.

16:40.083 --> 16:44.452
I don't want to brag, but we basically
have the best house on campus.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.082
What's with the Wall of Fame?

16:46.173 --> 16:48.630
Our founders and sisters have
gone on to bigger things.

16:48.717 --> 16:52.756
And they're super generous.
Wait until you try our chef's food.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.679
Chef? We have a chef?

16:57.267 --> 16:59.929
Ta-da! You like?

17:00.020 --> 17:03.353
--I love.
--I know, right? Too sweet.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.103
That one's Tasha's and Remy's
and you can have this bed.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.937
The last girl that stayed
here didn't seem to want it.

17:11.031 --> 17:14.774
You know, I'm not the type to gossip,
but I heard she just ran off one night.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.324
Are you worried about her?

17:16.411 --> 17:19.528
Try livid. You know, lots of
kids flake out first year,

17:19.623 --> 17:22.786
but we lost top girls to other
houses holding a spot for Gina.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.960
If she wasn't committed to Kappa,
she never should have rushed.

17:27.047 --> 17:32.132
But we wish her well and now
here you are, our silver lining.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.709
That's me.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.543
Let me at least get her crap out
of the way so you can start fresh.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.472
Don't worry about it.
Let me take that to security.

17:38.558 --> 17:42.176
It is the very least I can do
to thank my new sisters.

17:42.270 --> 17:46.889
See? Helpful. You are
totally Kappa material.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.396
Thanks. Bye.

18:42.122 --> 18:47.708
[cell phone ringing]

18:47.794 --> 18:48.579
Hey, what's up?

18:48.628 --> 18:52.587
Good news is I'm still alive.
The bad news is bitches be crazy.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.629
Oh, yeah, why is that?

18:53.717 --> 18:57.130
First of all, nobody not
evil can be so chipper.

18:57.220 --> 19:00.257
And second, these girls do
not take rejection well.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.306
You'd think Gina stood them up for
prom instead of going missing.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.883
So, I take it you're in then?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.388
[KENZI] So far, so good.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.095
I even have a box of Gina's
old stuff that she left behind.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.557
Nothing earth-shattering yet, just a
bunch of homework and hair products.

19:12.652 --> 19:16.486
Okay, well, keep looking. Can you
get a peek at the rest of the house?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.939
Not without the
Muffy Mafia seeing me.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.320
Maybe tonight, we're
having some kind of lame

19:21.411 --> 19:23.072
"girls night in" deal I
could sneak out of.

19:23.163 --> 19:27.577
Oh, will there be pillow fights?
Please tell me there'll be pillow fights.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.750
Gross, you perv.
How's your end coming?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.249
Not sure yet. Something
kinky about the Dean, maybe.

19:33.340 --> 19:37.333
I'm going to take a look around her office
tonight, so wish me luck. And, Kenzi--

19:37.427 --> 19:39.964
--[KENZ|] Uh huh?
--[BO] Stop stealing shit.

19:40.055 --> 19:43.013
Now that just plain hurts.

20:06.873 --> 20:23.882
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

20:23.973 --> 20:25.713
All right, who's next, bitches?

20:25.809 --> 20:28.516
I'm up! Yeah!

20:32.732 --> 20:46.533
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

20:46.621 --> 20:50.660
Is that a wig? Why are
you wearing a wig?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.535
Psoriasis.

20:51.626 --> 20:55.335
God, Libra! Insensitive much?

20:55.422 --> 20:57.037
My turn.

20:59.134 --> 21:03.878
I'm going to go adjust
myself and such.

21:06.599 --> 21:15.894
Chug! Chug! Chug!

21:55.815 --> 21:59.148
[TORI] What are you doing down here?

21:59.235 --> 22:04.229
I... was looking for the bathroom.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.985
I have a bashful bladder.

22:06.075 --> 22:10.409
Basement's off-limits.
Actives only. You know that.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.580
So, get your cute butt back up
here and come party with us!

22:13.666 --> 22:14.826
--Woo!
--Woo!

22:14.918 --> 22:16.704
Woo!

22:31.351 --> 22:34.309
[footsteps approaching]

22:39.692 --> 22:42.399
--Geez!
--What are you doing here?

22:44.030 --> 22:44.940
Are you drunk?

22:45.031 --> 22:48.114
I will have you know I am in character.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.112
Also... tipsy.

22:50.203 --> 22:54.196
Yeah, well, you look like you're
canvassing for the Young Conservatives.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.498
Please tell me you found something
so we can ditch this gig and head home.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.450
The all-day smiling is killing me.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.288
Nothing yet. But I don't really
know what I'm looking for.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.371
Anything with the Kappas?

23:03.466 --> 23:05.548
They definitely have something in
their basement they don't want peeped.

23:05.635 --> 23:10.174
They lock it up whenever they
aren't in there. I know this chippy.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.971
Peretti? Yeah, she's the Dean.

23:12.058 --> 23:18.054
She's also a Kappa. Or was. They
have her picture up at the house.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.978
--You're sure?
--Yeah.

23:20.066 --> 23:20.851
[chatter on police radio]

23:20.900 --> 23:25.064
Oh, shit. Patrol's early. Come on. Hide.
[chatter on police radio]

23:25.154 --> 23:26.735
[KENZI] Jesus!

23:41.087 --> 23:42.873
Eww.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.384
Well, this was pointless.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.219
Maybe not.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.808
Taped under the desk.
I almost missed it.

24:09.532 --> 24:12.399
--What is it, some kind of code?
--Hang on.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.409
That's not code, those
are student number IDs.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.706
Can you use those numbers
to get me their names?

24:20.793 --> 24:24.536
I can try. Still don't get why she
would tape it under her desk.

24:24.631 --> 24:27.714
l have no idea. But if it's worth hiding,
it's definitely worth finding out.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.256
Come on, let's go.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.133
Hey! Whatcha got there?

24:39.228 --> 24:40.729
Hey, Wayne, hey.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.223
Kind of early for your shift, aren't you?

24:42.315 --> 24:47.480
Yeah. I was just enjoying some of the
school resources. Just personal stuff.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.901
So, want to hear some gossip?

24:48.988 --> 24:51.400
Someone tried breaking into
the Dean's office last night.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.482
Busted a drawer and everything.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.783
--They know who?
--No, but we're doubling our sweeps

24:55.870 --> 24:59.362
and logging extra shifts, so enjoy
your personal time while you got it.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.666
Told you this place was exciting.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.544
--We need to talk.
--Yes, ma'am.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.934
You look like hell.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.436
I look like college.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.360
For preppies, those girls can hang.

25:30.446 --> 25:35.281
Turns out "girls night" was code for
"drink until your lips fall off

25:35.368 --> 25:41.034
and you start oversharing."
I think I touched a boob.

25:41.124 --> 25:42.785
Hey, you crack those
student numbers for me?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.617
Yeah, had to bribe some
kid at the Registrar's.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.452
What's with the paperwork?

25:47.547 --> 25:50.289
Oh, I played a hunch. Check this out.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.999
I've been wondering about all the
construction repairs on campus

25:53.094 --> 25:56.552
and that sinkhole that I found. It
turns out there are a bunch of caves

25:56.639 --> 25:58.846
from an underground stream
right under the school.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.549
--Go on.
--Looks like some of the old tunnels

26:01.644 --> 26:03.225
lead right to a few of the buildings,

26:03.312 --> 26:08.352
including Kappa House. I'm just not
sure how it all ties together yet.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.650
We may not have time
to figure it all out.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.570
It's our Kappa initiation tonight,
right in our basement.

26:13.656 --> 26:19.652
Dude, if they're doing something nasty
down there, I'm heading smack for it.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.077
Shit.

26:21.164 --> 26:23.120
[cell phone ringing]

26:24.792 --> 26:28.159
Dyson. I'll have him trace the names.

26:28.254 --> 26:32.167
Look, find out what you can about
tonight and we'll make a final plan, okay?

26:32.258 --> 26:35.250
--Uh huh.
--Be careful.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.843
Did you compromise your cover?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.016
I don't think so. Why?

26:44.103 --> 26:47.595
The Dean did a background
check on your references today.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.851
I handled it, but it
could have gone badly.

26:49.942 --> 26:55.528
I must be pushing her buttons.
Good. Anything on those names?

26:55.615 --> 26:58.778
All past students at Locksley.
All unaccounted for.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.529
Well, why didn't we know
about them earlier?

27:00.620 --> 27:03.236
Because none of their disappearances
were linked to Locksley.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.868
They either left a suicide note,
or their cars were found

27:05.958 --> 27:07.368
far from the campus, that sort of thing.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.293
Like somebody was trying
to cover their tracks.

27:10.379 --> 27:16.591
Well, if Peretti did take them,
I have a pretty good guess where.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.134
There are old tunnels
underneath the campus.

27:19.222 --> 27:22.134
One of them leads
directly to Kappa House.

27:22.225 --> 27:25.388
--Kappa House?
--Yeah, why?

27:25.478 --> 27:28.845
It's probably nothing,
it's just a... Just a thought.

27:31.234 --> 27:32.770
Here you go.

27:32.860 --> 27:33.815
Thank you.

27:33.903 --> 27:38.067
My name's Kala, by the way.
I'm new here.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.318
Pleasure.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.616
Could you give us a moment, please?

27:47.333 --> 27:51.417
Ah, so that's your Fae power, huh?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.916
Chick magnet.

27:54.006 --> 27:58.796
Seriously, what kind of Fae are
you, anyway? Or can't I ask?

27:58.886 --> 28:01.343
It's a pretty intimate
question in our culture.

28:01.430 --> 28:04.012
Lets the other person know
your specific weaknesses.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.217
Well, I already know about
that spot above your hip.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.974
I should get back.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.275
Well, it does look like there
may be a Fae connection here.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.943
What, is this the part where
you tell me to drop it?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.021
No. But since I set up your cover,

28:20.116 --> 28:22.448
I'd appreciate if you
checked in with me tonight,

28:22.535 --> 28:23.991
just to let me know you're okay.

28:24.078 --> 28:25.614
I can do that.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.696
Good.

28:27.790 --> 28:30.873
And there is one more thing
that I can do for you.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.885
[BO] Oh, head rush!

28:47.977 --> 28:51.140
If you're going out solo, the least
I can do is give you a top-up.

28:51.230 --> 28:55.064
Damn. You do not suck at that.

28:57.778 --> 29:02.192
I'll call you tonight. To check in.

29:03.326 --> 29:08.116
Before eight, please. I have a life.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.535
Give me a hand with these.

29:22.929 --> 29:27.889
Look, I know what you're going
to say. It's not a problem.

29:27.975 --> 29:31.012
Then you don't know what I'm
going to say. I think this is great.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.513
ReaHy?

29:32.605 --> 29:34.345
Of course not. What are you thinking?

29:34.440 --> 29:35.680
She needed healing, Trick.

29:35.775 --> 29:40.860
That's not what I saw. You're my eyes,
Dyson. I need you to stay objective.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.359
lam.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.407
Then keep your guard up with Bo.
We don't know if we can trust her yet.

29:46.494 --> 29:49.361
How many hoops does she
have to jump through, huh?

29:49.455 --> 29:51.411
We know more about
her than she does.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.785
And how do you think she's
going to react to that betrayal

29:53.876 --> 29:56.868
when she finds out the guy she's
sleeping with is lying to her?

29:56.963 --> 30:00.296
Especially, if you let her develop
feelings for you by then.

30:02.218 --> 30:05.301
"Let her"? Are we talking
about the same woman here?

30:05.388 --> 30:08.880
Dyson, it could be enough
to turn her from us.

30:08.975 --> 30:12.388
She wouldn't be the first to
join the Dark for revenge.

30:12.478 --> 30:18.314
Look, I'm sorry. Things are
complicated enough as it is.

30:18.401 --> 30:19.732
You know the stakes.

30:19.819 --> 30:23.858
We can't afford an emotional attachment.
For Bo's sake as much as ours.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.491
Assuming I agree with you,

30:31.664 --> 30:33.780
what would you have me do?

30:33.874 --> 30:37.287
Whatever it takes. Just end it.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.472
Well, there's an entrance
near these running paths

30:51.559 --> 30:53.095
near the old sinkhole that I found.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.097
I'll go in from there and we'll
pinch this thing from both sides.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.520
You from underground,
me from above. Got it.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.690
Do not go into that basement until
you get the signal that I'm there, okay?

31:01.777 --> 31:02.766
We don't know what
they have planned.

31:02.862 --> 31:05.069
Trust me. I'm no hero.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.290
This one's on me.

31:22.381 --> 31:26.124
--Thanks.
--You look like you're hard at work.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.960
Yeah.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.841
Okay.

31:35.144 --> 31:39.979
Hey, what did you say
your name was again?

31:40.066 --> 31:42.022
lt's Kala.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.690
Hi, Kala.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.044
What the hell...?

32:12.139 --> 32:17.224
...instrumentum.
Adlatum ornamentum.

32:19.980 --> 32:23.689
It's time. This doorway is a portal.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.516
You stand here as pledges,

32:25.611 --> 32:27.852
--you enter and become Kappas.
--Come on, Bo, come on!

32:27.947 --> 32:31.531
Pledge, you may enter.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.573
What? Me now?

32:39.041 --> 32:41.077
--I'm not ready yet.
--Open the door.

32:41.168 --> 32:45.332
I changed my mind. You know,
I'm really more of a Theta.

32:48.801 --> 32:52.714
Surprise!
[cheering]

32:52.805 --> 32:56.593
Congratulations. You are
now full-fledged Kappas.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.349
When does the killing start?

33:07.862 --> 33:11.104
[cell phone ringing]

33:11.198 --> 33:13.439
--Kenzi.
--Bo, we screwed up somewhere.

33:13.534 --> 33:14.398
It's not the Kappas.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.573
Well, I don't know what
the hell's going on,

33:15.661 --> 33:18.528
but I'm heading back to interrogate
the Dean. You're okay, though?

33:21.000 --> 33:24.413
Bo? Bo, are you there? Bo?

33:24.503 --> 33:26.789
I hope you're not dead, girly.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.961
'Cause he likes them with some fight.

33:34.096 --> 33:37.384
[KENZI] Bo? Are you there, Bo?

34:03.876 --> 34:07.869
[cell phone ringing]

34:07.963 --> 34:13.629
Bo, you are late. I was starting to
worry... Kenzi, Kenzi. Slow down.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.129
Last I heard, Bo was heading here.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.131
Where?

34:16.222 --> 34:17.428
This door.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.481
Well, she's not going to be much help.

34:29.568 --> 34:34.358
Now, how the hell are we supposed to
find Bo? Those tunnels run for miles.

34:34.448 --> 34:36.905
New plan. Come on.

34:56.095 --> 34:58.711
I didn't want to underestimate you.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.006
Professional courtesy and all.

35:02.101 --> 35:05.059
Thanks. I'm touched.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.353
[GINA crying]

35:08.440 --> 35:10.556
Gina! Gina, are you okay?

35:10.651 --> 35:15.020
She's fine. She's fine! Yeah.

35:15.114 --> 35:18.231
Maybe a little dehydrated,
but that's the way he likes them.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.235
Easier to...

35:19.326 --> 35:20.611
[sucking noise]

35:20.703 --> 35:23.410
...get out all the good stuff.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.783
But you'll learn about
that soon enough.

35:25.874 --> 35:30.368
"He" who? Is someone
else coming, huh?

35:30.462 --> 35:33.374
You not man enough
to fight me yourself?

35:33.465 --> 35:38.550
I'm not the violent type, no.
Unlike my hungry friend down there.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.629
Me? Well, I just like to watch.

35:41.724 --> 35:43.715
So, what, you hunt these girls down

35:43.809 --> 35:46.972
and feed them to your swampy little
friend? Is that how this works?

35:47.062 --> 35:49.314
Pretty much. I got no complaints.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.855
Why? What's in it for you, Wayne?

35:56.989 --> 36:03.030
Vitality. All the freshness he drains
from the girls ends up in this water.

36:05.539 --> 36:07.905
Mmm.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.118
I've barely aged a day since I found
him starving down here in '42.

36:14.256 --> 36:16.793
You know, you want to know the
truth? The god's honest truth?

36:16.884 --> 36:20.342
You know, I haven't even
told my therapist this.

36:20.429 --> 36:26.516
But I would do it all just to see
these privileged bitches scream.

36:26.602 --> 36:31.437
Don't you touch her! And I'm
not exactly privileged, genius.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.855
No, you are a snoop. Like Peretti.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.684
Peretti started putting the pieces
together, thought that you would, too.

36:36.779 --> 36:40.488
Worried that you would blab and ruin
the school's precious reputation.

36:47.915 --> 36:52.659
She actually ordered that these caves
were to be sealed, just in case.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.837
Well, that didn't end
too well for her, did it?

37:01.387 --> 37:04.754
[gong]

37:06.141 --> 37:07.847
[WAYNE] Dinner time.

37:07.935 --> 37:11.393
Well, I really wish I could stay
here and watch. I really do.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.894
But I got another mess to clean up.

37:20.280 --> 37:24.569
[BO] Gina! Hey! It's going to be okay.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.696
It's coming!

37:26.787 --> 37:30.530
Hang on, Gina, hang on.

37:30.624 --> 37:32.660
Bo's still not answering her phone.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.083
How do we even know
where we're going?

37:35.170 --> 37:38.378
Wait. Let me focus.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.506
What the hell are you doing?

37:48.600 --> 37:51.342
The trail's mixed with someone else's.
I can't follow the scent like this.

37:51.437 --> 37:55.021
Listen, if this thing is Fae,
I have an idea what kind.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.849
You got to tell Bo this thing's
going to have a head like a teapot.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.729
You tell her to knock the top off!

37:59.820 --> 38:01.902
Why can't you tell her?

38:03.991 --> 38:09.657
Holy shit balls! That was awesome!

38:14.376 --> 38:16.788
[roaring]

38:16.879 --> 38:19.837
[GINA screaming]

38:27.556 --> 38:29.421
Your mom sent me. I'm going
to get you out of here, okay?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.097
We got to move fast. Can you walk?

38:31.185 --> 38:32.470
I think so.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.677
[roaring]

38:44.531 --> 38:47.898
Here, boy.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.654
Yoo hoo!

38:51.914 --> 38:54.451
I have... treats?

39:01.590 --> 39:06.550
[growling]

39:16.355 --> 39:19.518
[WAYNE screaming]

39:59.398 --> 40:01.013
Is he dead?

40:02.818 --> 40:04.683
Yeah, it's dead.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.234
Gina!

40:08.740 --> 40:10.355
[GINA] Thank you so, so much.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.611
[BO] Okay. Let's get you home.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.328
And why are you half-naked?

40:17.416 --> 40:22.331
Can I tell her? Let me tell her,
come on. Let me tell her.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.957
Let's go.

40:34.016 --> 40:36.098
[KENZI] Bo.
[knocking on door]

40:36.184 --> 40:38.220
Nobody's home.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.019
[KENZI] Check it.

40:42.107 --> 40:45.725
[BO] That's a face I never
want to see again. Turn.

40:47.529 --> 40:50.692
Dyson sent it. It's called a Kappa.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.865
Some kind of Japanese
Fae. Poetic, huh?

40:53.952 --> 40:57.194
Not up close. What
about Wayne and Gina?

40:57.289 --> 41:00.372
Mr. Dyson says they'll be
pinning everything on Wayne.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.701
And they'll pull some kind of
Fae hoodoo to convince Gina

41:03.795 --> 41:06.252
that he was working alone.

41:06.340 --> 41:10.253
Now, can we talk about
the elephant in the room,

41:10.344 --> 41:15.088
and by elephant, I mean
sexy, sexy wolf man?

41:16.224 --> 41:19.387
A, he's awesome. And B, you lurve him.

41:19.478 --> 41:24.097
Oh, by the way, I totally
saw his wolfjunk. High five.

41:24.191 --> 41:26.557
Okay. What is the matter with you?

41:26.652 --> 41:31.612
I'm just happy for you. You know, most
love lives don't include a body count.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.780
You're kind of due for some happy.

41:33.867 --> 41:37.780
And seeing as he's saved your
life, like, twice this last week,

41:37.871 --> 41:40.328
I'd say Dyson's one of the good ones.

41:40.415 --> 41:41.951
He is pretty great.

41:42.042 --> 41:45.250
Aww! I knew you loved him.

41:45.337 --> 41:49.330
I don't know. God, it's ridiculous.

41:49.424 --> 41:53.508
I feel like a teenager. You
tell me. What do I do next?

41:53.595 --> 41:57.804
I'd say next, you tell him.

42:00.394 --> 42:03.477
Killing people is so much easier.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.272
Hey, is Dyson still here?

42:11.363 --> 42:13.228
He's in the back.

42:29.047 --> 42:31.254
Bo, wait.

42:32.551 --> 42:36.294
Hang on. Are you okay?

42:36.388 --> 42:40.176
Yeah, great. I was just thinking that

42:40.267 --> 42:42.804
maybe we could hang out
tonight or something.

42:42.894 --> 42:46.307
I could thank you properly.
I guess you're busy.

42:46.398 --> 42:49.481
About the other night.

42:49.568 --> 42:53.652
I am always there for you like that
when you need to be healed,

42:53.739 --> 42:55.354
but that's all it was.

42:57.409 --> 42:59.445
It's all it can be.

43:00.787 --> 43:04.405
I'm sorry. I thought
we were clear on that.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.036
I think you know that we weren't.

43:09.296 --> 43:14.381
But it's fine. We're definitely clear now.
