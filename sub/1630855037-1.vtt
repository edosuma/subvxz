WEBVTT

00:40.736 --> 00:41.911
Call Brad.

00:43.565 --> 00:44.566
Hey, Leila.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.481
I need your help.
Meet me at Iris's.

00:46.611 --> 00:47.177
I'll be right there.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.758
Iris! Oh my God!

01:02.845 --> 01:06.109
No, no! Please. Please
don't die on me.

01:09.460 --> 01:13.551
You're the only family I
have! Oh, my God! Please!

01:13.638 --> 01:18.600
I can't lose you!

01:21.951 --> 01:23.257
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:26.651 --> 01:28.218
What did you do to Iris?

02:03.340 --> 02:05.951
Leila? Is everything...?

02:06.038 --> 02:07.953
Oh my God, what
the hell happened?

02:16.919 --> 02:18.355
We have to call
the cops.

02:18.442 --> 02:19.704
No. No, hey, no.

02:24.448 --> 02:25.275
I know how to handle this.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.520
I got in over my head.

02:52.607 --> 02:53.738
But I'm good for it, I promise.

02:53.869 --> 02:54.870
I just need more time.

02:56.828 --> 02:57.786
I know, OK?

03:12.975 --> 03:14.368
Who was that on
the phone?

03:16.457 --> 03:17.197
No one.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.725
It's just drama, OK? Nothing
for you to worry about.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.599
What'd you get from the store?

03:28.686 --> 03:30.732
Just some snacks
and beer.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.788
I'm not even attracted
to her! You know that!

04:26.918 --> 04:28.703
You were all over
each other in school.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.226
We were just talking.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.923
Can't I have one
conversation with a girl

04:32.054 --> 04:33.360
without you getting jealous?

04:33.447 --> 04:35.144
If that's all you were doing,
I wouldn't have a problem.

04:36.841 --> 04:37.799
Look. I gotta go.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.631
Hey, what are you doing up here?

04:43.761 --> 04:45.241
Oh, hi Hazel.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.287
Uh, I was working
on a school project.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.596
Didn't sound
like homework.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.815
Boy trouble?

04:55.382 --> 04:58.907
Look, I've had my fair
share of bad relationships.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.125
Don't give someone
your attention

05:00.212 --> 05:01.126
who doesn't deserve it.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.217
I'm just dropping off
some stuff for Nora.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.349
She's been keeping
me really busy

05:06.436 --> 05:09.091
helping out around
the house. She told me

05:09.178 --> 05:11.223
you're having some
trouble in biology class.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.053
I think your dad's a
bit concerned, too.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.621
So, if you need a
tutor, I'm your gal.

05:17.707 --> 05:19.493
Thanks, Hazel, for
offering to help

05:19.580 --> 05:22.278
and for the
relationship advice.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.062
Anytime.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.020
Oh, and if
you need help

05:25.107 --> 05:26.848
practicing for your
driver's test...

05:26.935 --> 05:29.677
I don't want my license.
We live in the city;

05:29.807 --> 05:32.332
I can just walk
or ride share.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.725
OK, well if you
change your mind,

05:34.812 --> 05:36.031
all you've gotta
do is ask.

05:36.118 --> 05:36.814
See ya later.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.350
Violet?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.003
-Sorry, I thought
that you were Dad.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.136
No he's working late on
that big work project.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.832
And then he's
going for his run.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.793
Right. Marathon
training.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.231
Mm. My sister Faith is
coming into town soon.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.059
I was thinking of
doing a spa day.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.365
Would you like
to join us?

06:06.801 --> 06:09.151
I don't like pampering
and stuff. You know that.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.462
I know it's been tough not
having your dad around much.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.681
As soon as his work
project wraps up

06:17.768 --> 06:22.686
and his marathon is over,
I'm sure he'll be home more.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.353
Leila: I thought you were
coming home an hour ago.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.835
I got held up.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.402
Seems like that's
becoming a habit.

06:44.707 --> 06:46.231
What's going on?

06:46.318 --> 06:47.363
-Just work stuff.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.019
Does it have something
to do with all the

06:51.149 --> 06:52.412
strange phone calls you've
been getting lately?

06:54.849 --> 06:57.939
Someone slipped
this under the door.

06:58.069 --> 07:01.029
Your neighbor got
it by accident.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.726
Heredity
House DNA Testing Kit?

07:06.469 --> 07:07.557
You did one of these?

07:07.688 --> 07:10.081
I did it a couple weeks
ago. Not a big deal

07:10.168 --> 07:10.952
Why didn't you tell me?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.785
Go ahead. Open it.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.791
What. You don't want me to see?

07:27.316 --> 07:28.491
I just need a minute.

08:21.936 --> 08:22.806
Mrs. Hyatt?

08:22.937 --> 08:25.026
Yes.

08:25.156 --> 08:30.205
I'm Detective Howard. Is
your husband Scott Hyatt?

08:30.335 --> 08:32.816
Yes! He's on a run.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.384
I'm just visiting with
my sister right now.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.558
What is this
concerning?

08:37.691 --> 08:39.388
May I come in?

08:41.303 --> 08:42.957
Of course.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.792
Howard: Mrs. Hyatt, I
have some bad news.

08:53.576 --> 08:58.059
Your husband's body was
found in Baker Crest Park

08:58.189 --> 09:01.671
on one of the trails
about an hour ago.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.065
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.545
Oh, my God!

09:25.565 --> 09:26.914
We have reason to believe

09:27.044 --> 09:29.656
someone was involved
in his death.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.571
The portion of the
trail where he was found

09:31.701 --> 09:33.964
is less busy,
especially at night.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.235
Out here training
for the marathon?

09:52.940 --> 09:54.811
Investigators
at the crime scene

09:54.898 --> 09:57.335
say that it
appears he was hit

09:57.466 --> 10:00.948
with some type of blunt
force trauma to the head.

10:01.078 --> 10:04.255
Now all we need to
know is who did it.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.518
I should have been there.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.259
He's training for a marathon;

10:08.346 --> 10:10.871
we were supposed
to run it together.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.916
If I was there, he
would still be alive.

10:16.572 --> 10:19.009
I know this is not
the ideal time to ask,

10:19.140 --> 10:22.230
but can you tell me
where you were tonight?

10:29.019 --> 10:29.846
Violet?

10:33.763 --> 10:35.417
Howard: So just
to confirm,

10:35.504 --> 10:37.288
the two of you were here
together all night?

10:37.419 --> 10:41.466
Yes. We were watching
a movie together.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.817
It's my last day in town.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.993
You're planning on
leaving tomorrow?

10:46.123 --> 10:49.170
Uh, hopefully I can
stay a little longer.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.128
I'm just gonna need
to check in with work.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.000
Just give a good
contact number.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.045
What do you mean?

10:55.132 --> 10:56.133
Well, as the sole witness to

10:56.264 --> 10:58.309
Mrs. Hyatt's
whereabouts tonight,

10:58.396 --> 10:59.659
we'll just be checking
in on a few things.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.228
Detective, you don't
think that I...?

11:04.359 --> 11:06.274
Unfortunately, in
cases like these,

11:06.361 --> 11:08.102
we need to investigate
the spouse first.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.017
We're just doing
our job, Mrs. Hyatt.

11:12.584 --> 11:16.197
I can't believe this.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.942
Did they say
how he died?

11:24.684 --> 11:31.255
I don't know. Why is the
whole world against me?

11:31.342 --> 11:34.345
My mom's dead.
Now my dad.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.564
I feel like
I'm cursed.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.701
I have no one.

11:41.788 --> 11:46.531
Hey, that's not true.
You've got me. And Nora.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.754
Look, I know you two
aren't exactly close,

11:51.841 --> 11:54.714
but you're not alone. OK?

12:11.992 --> 12:16.692
Ooh. Violet, honey, I
have some terrible news.

12:17.998 --> 12:27.137
I already know. I
heard the detective.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.487
How did he die?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.185
-They don't know yet,

12:31.272 --> 12:33.927
but they suspect it
wasn't an accident.

12:34.014 --> 12:34.928
What do you mean?

12:38.540 --> 12:41.325
Somebody did
this to my dad?

12:41.412 --> 12:43.414
We don't know yet, honey.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.633
Did you ask the police?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.722
Did you, did you talk to
them? What did you say?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.377
Violet, of course we asked.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.205
I was worried about you.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.684
I didn't know where you were;

12:52.815 --> 12:55.035
you didn't call or text.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.472
Since when do I ever
let you know where I am?

12:57.559 --> 12:59.430
I let Dad know.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.096
Leila: Oh, my God. I
don't believe this

13:23.715 --> 13:24.673
Something happened to your dad?

13:29.025 --> 13:32.333
It says they have no
leads. How can that be?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.690
It's late. Who the hell is that?
-Shh.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.474
Man at door: Come
on, Brad. Open up!

13:43.561 --> 13:45.868
What is going on?
-Sh!

13:45.955 --> 13:47.217
I know you're in
there, Brad!

13:51.047 --> 13:51.918
Brad, open the door!

14:01.579 --> 14:02.667
Tell me, right now,
what's happening.

14:07.803 --> 14:12.764
I um, I owe someone
a little money.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.376
My bookie. I bet on the
fight last week and now...

14:15.506 --> 14:16.725
How much?

14:17.769 --> 14:18.640
Fifty thousand.

14:23.732 --> 14:24.733
Leila!

14:34.874 --> 14:38.486
Leila! Leila, let
me come with you.

14:38.616 --> 14:42.490
You lied to me! You
put us both in danger.

14:42.577 --> 14:43.795
Look. You're going to
meet your real family

14:43.883 --> 14:44.579
for the first time.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.410
I love you. Let
me be with you.

14:51.673 --> 14:55.372
I'm sorry. I
need space.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.970
Sweetie, this school
thing is a real problem.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.319
I know, Dad!

15:29.450 --> 15:30.103
Violet, look at me.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.846
I know things have been
really hard with you

15:34.977 --> 15:39.547
and I know that you still
miss your mom. I do, too.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.592
It sure doesn't seem like it.

15:41.679 --> 15:46.989
Honey, I will
never stop loving her.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.078
She'll always be a part
of me, a part of us.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.431
Maybe it's time that we went
back to family therapy.

15:54.518 --> 15:57.957
Why? Because that worked
out so well before?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.133
Honey, this is serious.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.308
You heard the
guidance counselor.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.483
If you don't pull
your grades up,

16:02.613 --> 16:04.702
you won't graduate.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.487
I know that maybe you think

16:06.617 --> 16:08.271
that the family therapy
didn't work out.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.925
It didn't work out
because of you!

16:10.056 --> 16:12.667
Ever since Mom died, all
you care about is Nora,

16:12.754 --> 16:15.148
your business, and
that stupid marathon.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.324
I can't wait to move
out of the house

16:17.454 --> 16:18.325
to leave you and Nora behind.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.689
I'm sorry for what I said, Dad.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.133
Nora: In lieu of flowers,

16:44.220 --> 16:45.482
I've asked everyone
to make a donation

16:45.613 --> 16:47.136
to Scott's favorite charity.

16:47.267 --> 16:50.922
Ah, that's perfect. I'm
so sorry I have to leave.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.403
I wish I could stay longer,
but the kids in my class,

16:53.534 --> 16:55.144
they're really struggling
with the substitute.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.407
No, I completely understand.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.583
And thank you so much
for staying here with me

16:59.714 --> 17:01.368
for a few extra days.

17:01.455 --> 17:04.675
Anything for my sister.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.329
What can I do from New York?

17:06.460 --> 17:08.201
Um, help with the arrangements?

17:08.288 --> 17:09.810
No, you have done enough.

17:09.896 --> 17:12.161
And I've got Hazel
here to help me.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.207
Why don't you just get
back to those kids.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.383
And sis. Thank you
for everything.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.214
Uh, I'm just gonna
go to school.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.218
I have to grab something
from my locker.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.133
Let me get my car
keys, I'll drive you.

17:27.262 --> 17:31.050
It's OK. I'll walk; I just
really need fresh air.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.546
Hello, sister.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.086
Shane: No, I'm
single. I swear!

18:07.173 --> 18:10.045
So what I'm thinkin'
is, you and I, dinner?

18:14.658 --> 18:17.748
Sorry.

18:17.879 --> 18:18.836
My dad dies and
you're still

18:18.967 --> 18:21.622
messing with other
girls behind my back.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.319
Not messin' around
with other girls.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.712
Come on, would I
ever do that to you?

18:29.760 --> 18:30.544
Look, I'm...

18:30.631 --> 18:34.287
I'm done with this. With us!

18:34.417 --> 18:36.941
So what? You're breaking up
with me? Are you serious?

19:00.008 --> 19:00.922
Nora?

19:02.445 --> 19:03.316
Yes.

19:05.579 --> 19:08.538
I'm sorry this is
probably a strange time

19:08.625 --> 19:10.018
for me to show up
at your door.

19:12.803 --> 19:17.112
My name is Leila.
I'm Scott's daughter.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.524
I appreciate you sharing
all of this with me, Leila.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.917
And I'm sorry you never
got to meet your father.

19:40.004 --> 19:43.704
He was a wonderful man. In
fact, you remind me of him.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.186
I do? How?

19:48.883 --> 19:50.014
You have his green eyes.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.454
I don't mean to be presumptuous,

19:54.584 --> 19:57.761
but I assume you're here
to talk about Scott's will?

19:57.848 --> 20:01.461
Oh, no. I don't care
about the money.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.897
So, you're just here
to pay your respects?

20:04.725 --> 20:06.640
And, more importantly,
to meet my sister.

20:06.727 --> 20:07.554
She's out right now.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.341
I see... well then...

20:12.472 --> 20:14.648
I guess I'll get going.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.477
I know this isn't the best
time for me to be here.

20:17.607 --> 20:20.393
You mentioned the police
still don't have any leads.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.656
Sadly, not yet.

20:22.743 --> 20:26.007
Would it be OK if I left
my phone number for Violet

20:26.094 --> 20:27.574
just in case she's
interested in connecting?

20:29.097 --> 20:30.707
I'd also love to know
when you have a date

20:30.838 --> 20:32.579
for the memorial service.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.408
Of course!

20:35.495 --> 20:38.106
So does that mean you'll be
staying in town for a bit?

20:39.934 --> 20:40.587
Probably a few weeks.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.027
It's really nice
to meet you, Nora.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.463
Have a good night.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.770
You too, Leila.
Here. I'll walk you.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.339
Good night.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.139
Violet?

21:16.057 --> 21:16.927
I didn't know you were back.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.454
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.414
I'm not really in the
mood for chit chat.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.287
What is all this?

21:35.337 --> 21:38.732
I'm looking up every
single one of Dad's friends

21:38.862 --> 21:42.388
on social media and I'm
contacting them and asking

21:42.518 --> 21:45.304
them where they were
the night that Dad died.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.828
Honey, the police are
already doing that.

21:47.915 --> 21:55.270
Days ago! It's been days. We
don't have even one clue.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.578
I mean, Detective Howard?

21:58.708 --> 21:59.840
He questioned us.

22:02.277 --> 22:05.280
Who else is he even
talking to? Anyone?

22:05.367 --> 22:07.195
It takes time, Violet.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.110
Well, I want to know
who killed my dad,

22:09.197 --> 22:11.286
so I'm not just gonna
sit here waiting around.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.855
I understand. But...

22:18.598 --> 22:21.035
We had a visit from a woman.

22:24.517 --> 22:28.869
She is... your half sister.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.703
Excuse me?

22:36.790 --> 22:41.316
Your dad, a long time
ago before you were born,

22:41.403 --> 22:45.233
he fathered a child.
He never knew.

22:52.153 --> 22:56.853
Well, it's convenient
for her to show up now.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.900
She seemed sincere...

22:59.987 --> 23:03.773
but I will be calling the
detective to tell him.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.732
We certainly can't
take any chances.

23:10.345 --> 23:11.738
What's her name?

23:15.045 --> 23:16.046
Leila Moore.

23:35.588 --> 23:36.110
Leila!

23:41.637 --> 23:43.378
You followed me here?

23:43.465 --> 23:45.946
Hey. Don't be mad, OK?

23:46.033 --> 23:48.601
I told you I wanted space.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.646
It's not OK to track
me down like this.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.519
I know. I just...
tried calling you.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.434
What about the money you owe?

23:55.521 --> 23:57.392
What if they followed you here?

23:57.479 --> 24:00.569
I gotta guy here in
Philly. He can help me out.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.745
I can't believe this.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.443
Why don't I get us a motel room?

24:07.402 --> 24:14.627
No. Look, the truth is,
things haven't been good

24:14.714 --> 24:17.238
between us for a while now.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.979
And after this whole crazy mess,

24:19.066 --> 24:20.328
I think it's best
if we both moved on.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.289
So you have a new family and
you're throwing me away?

24:27.117 --> 24:29.511
That's not what I'm doing.

24:29.642 --> 24:30.947
I wonder how they'd
feel if they knew

24:31.034 --> 24:33.950
you murdered someone.

24:34.081 --> 24:36.344
How could you say that?

24:36.431 --> 24:38.259
That was self-defense
and you know that!

24:38.346 --> 24:40.914
Yeah, you're right. You're
right. I was outta line.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.785
Just leave me alone!

24:52.534 --> 24:53.970
Nora: That's really all
I know about Leila

24:54.057 --> 24:55.232
from our conversation

24:55.319 --> 24:57.191
Howard: Did she say
where she was staying?

24:57.321 --> 24:59.802
No, she didn't. I
should've asked.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.064
She has a vehicle?

25:01.195 --> 25:04.067
I noticed she was
driving a small SUV.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.417
We can look up any vehicle
registered to her name.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.507
OK. Thank you.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.510
What did the
detective say?

25:13.642 --> 25:14.687
They want to
talk to Leila.

25:19.387 --> 25:25.349
I just... I keep getting
this awful feeling.

25:25.436 --> 25:26.873
I just want time to
grieve my husband.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.398
How could they think I would
do something like this?

25:32.618 --> 25:36.230
I'm so sorry, Nora. I know
how hard this is for you.

25:37.884 --> 25:42.236
Thank you for being
here with me, Hazel.

25:42.366 --> 25:43.672
Hm.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.808
Howard: Is there someone in
Atlanta I can speak to

25:48.895 --> 25:50.026
who can vouch for your
whereabouts the night

25:50.157 --> 25:51.985
of Mr. Hyatt's murder?

25:52.072 --> 25:53.508
Laila: I think I ordered
some takeout that night.

25:53.639 --> 25:54.422
There should be a receipt.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.992
I'm gonna level
with you, Ms. Moore.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.472
The timing of your arrival
is pretty suspicious.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.606
I realize that, but
I promise I only came

26:04.693 --> 26:06.565
to get to know my sister
and to pay my respects.

26:10.264 --> 26:12.571
Nora: So I spoke with the
funeral director today.

26:12.658 --> 26:13.746
He said we should
start thinking about

26:13.833 --> 26:16.009
clothes to bury your dad in.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.011
Does that mean that we're
gonna have a service?

26:18.098 --> 26:21.623
No. Not until the police
can release his body.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.059
But we can still do
all the preparations

26:23.146 --> 26:23.886
for when that
time comes.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.456
We can pick out his
clothes together.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.286
Or I thought it
might be something

26:32.373 --> 26:35.942
you'd like to do alone.
You know your dad best.

26:41.774 --> 26:42.731
Thanks, Nora.

27:30.474 --> 27:31.954
Moissy Fine Jewelry?

28:32.275 --> 28:33.494
Those are lovely.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.582
Yeah. They're from Leila.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.542
When was she here?

28:38.629 --> 28:39.413
I don't know; I just
found them outside.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.375
"Thank you for being so
welcoming to me last night.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.073
Wishing you all the
comfort and peace

28:47.203 --> 28:49.075
during this difficult
time. Leila."

28:50.554 --> 28:51.251
That's a nice gesture.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.776
The detective spoke
with Leila today.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.082
The alibi she gave
them checked out.

28:59.041 --> 29:02.044
We should invite
her for dinner.

29:02.131 --> 29:04.046
You want to do that?

29:04.133 --> 29:05.265
If we have her
for dinner,

29:05.395 --> 29:07.876
then we can find
why she's here.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.357
She did leave
her number.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.576
Tomorrow night doesn't work.
But maybe the following?

29:46.959 --> 29:48.787
Hey.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.179
-That guy followed
you here, didn't he?

29:50.266 --> 29:51.398
What?

29:51.485 --> 29:53.269
I'm pretty sure
someone just shot at me

29:53.356 --> 29:55.271
in the parking garage.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.707
-OK, don't be ridiculous.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.666
It was probably just
a car backfiring.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.450
Why would anyone come
after you anyway?

30:00.537 --> 30:03.453
-Because scaring me
would get you to pay.

30:03.584 --> 30:06.892
You need to deal with this now.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.111
=OK, listen, I may need
your help. My contact here

30:09.198 --> 30:10.896
isn't panning out
the way I thought.

30:10.983 --> 30:14.029
-This isn't my mess to clean
up, Brad. I've gotta go.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.466
I've gotta go find
somewhere else to sleep.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.609
Howard: We finally have a break
in your husband's case.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.480
A witness came forward who
was at Baker Crest Park

30:30.567 --> 30:32.874
the night your husband died.
We didn't see who did it,

30:33.005 --> 30:35.877
but we have some
interesting information.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.184
They said that they saw
Scott in the parking lot

30:38.314 --> 30:41.970
with a woman, although they
didn't get a clear description.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.799
Nora, I have to ask again:

30:44.886 --> 30:47.541
were you at Baker Crest Park
the night your husband died?

30:47.628 --> 30:50.587
-No, Detective Howard,
we've been over this.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.807
I was here at the
house with my sister.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.330
You've traced my phone.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.897
You've watched my
security camera footage.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.159
-Well, if it wasn't you,
there's a possibility

30:57.246 --> 30:57.856
there was another woman.

31:00.336 --> 31:03.252
Was your husband
having an affair?

31:03.383 --> 31:05.733
Take some time, Mrs.
Hyatt. Then call me.

31:14.960 --> 31:19.660
Nora, I just got back into
town, and I heard the news.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.444
I am so sorry about Scott.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.098
Thanks, Maya.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.840
Look, I know we've
had our differences,

31:25.971 --> 31:28.277
and it's mostly my fault,

31:28.408 --> 31:32.020
but if you need any
help...I'm here.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.413
I appreciate that.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.026
I should get back inside.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.768
Of course. Yes. Take care.

32:02.224 --> 32:03.704
Hey.

32:03.834 --> 32:07.099
Hi. You're Violet.

32:09.971 --> 32:14.933
Yeah. That's me,
your secret sister.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.632
I'm really sorry
about everything.

32:24.072 --> 32:28.424
So um, what made
you take a DNA test?

32:28.511 --> 32:29.948
I wanted to know who my dad was.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.300
And your mom never told you?

32:34.430 --> 32:35.649
She didn't tell me
a lot of things.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.263
She wasn't around
much. And when she was,

32:41.350 --> 32:45.702
she definitely wasn't
clean or sober.

32:45.789 --> 32:48.749
Why didn't you take
a DNA test sooner?

32:48.836 --> 32:52.274
Someone really close to
me died three months ago,

32:52.361 --> 32:58.280
and it got me really
thinking - hoping - that

32:58.411 --> 32:59.803
I had family out
there somewhere.

33:03.198 --> 33:06.462
Leila! Welcome, come in!

33:06.549 --> 33:08.116
You didn't need
to bring anything.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.509
Oh, it's not much.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.908
So, when I lost
my foster sister,

33:17.996 --> 33:19.475
it was like my
whole world ended.

33:21.390 --> 33:22.609
How'd it happen?

33:24.524 --> 33:25.351
It was an accident.

33:29.616 --> 33:31.096
Nora: So where are you staying?

33:31.183 --> 33:33.576
Just my car.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.230
Is that safe?

33:35.317 --> 33:38.364
Not really. But it's all
I can afford right now.

33:42.629 --> 33:43.369
She could stay with us.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.025
Pardon?

33:47.155 --> 33:50.332
We have an extra
bedroom for Leila.

33:50.419 --> 33:53.988
I don't want to impose, Nora.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.163
We'd be happy to have you stay.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.212
That'd be nice.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.608
So the bathroom is
right next door.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.132
And you can use the
top drawer in there

34:07.262 --> 34:08.742
for your stuff.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.831
Make yourself at home.
Do you need anything?

34:10.918 --> 34:13.659
I'm fine; the room
is all I need.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.748
Thank you so much for
letting me stay, Nora.

34:15.835 --> 34:16.750
Of course.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.373
Violet?

34:31.460 --> 34:36.291
Hey, I know this
must be hard for you.

34:36.422 --> 34:40.382
Losing your dad. I
show up at your house.

34:40.469 --> 34:43.690
I get the hint you
don't exactly trust me.

34:43.777 --> 34:44.429
What makes you say that?

34:47.433 --> 34:48.650
Because you remind
me a lot of myself

34:48.737 --> 34:51.480
when I was your age.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.221
You want to trust
people but you're afraid

34:53.308 --> 34:55.702
that they'll hurt you...

34:55.831 --> 34:56.616
or that you'll lose them.

35:00.141 --> 35:03.231
How about this. I'll
give you my phone number,

35:03.362 --> 35:04.972
my home address, whatever
you want to know about me.

35:11.457 --> 35:12.588
Here.

35:28.691 --> 35:29.866
Can I help you, Miss?

35:29.953 --> 35:31.912
Uh, yeah. I was wondering
if you could let me know

35:31.999 --> 35:34.175
what this receipt's for.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.090
I'm sorry. I can't give
out that information.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.265
All our sales are private.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.965
OK.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.403
Um, I'll just look
around then. Thanks.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.839
Let me know if you'd
like to see something.

35:55.501 --> 35:56.850
Moissy Fine Jewelry.
How may I help you?

35:59.287 --> 36:01.985
You know I can't take
personal calls at work.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.857
Can't this wait until later?

36:05.293 --> 36:07.121
That's ridiculous,
Tom and you know it.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.429
No! No, I did not
say that to her.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.735
We can deal with this
when I get home tonight.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.128
I've gotta go.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.392
Young lady, what do
you think you're doing?

36:17.479 --> 36:19.002
You're stealing private
customer information.

36:19.089 --> 36:19.699
I'm sorry.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.746
I may need to speak
to your parents.

36:23.877 --> 36:27.097
I don't have any parents.
They're both dead.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.882
OK. Well, you must
have a guardian.

36:33.669 --> 36:34.844
Yeah, here.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.371
You can call her.
Her name's Leila.

36:46.116 --> 36:48.467
I totally thought she was
gonna call the cops on me.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.033
Thanks for
bailing me out.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.166
What were you doing
in there anyway?

36:52.297 --> 36:58.520
Uh, I found this
in Dad's pocket.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.783
It's a receipt for a
really expensive necklace

37:00.914 --> 37:05.440
that he bought in cash.
Kinda strange, right?

37:05.527 --> 37:10.706
I'd say so. Do you want
to show it to the cops?

37:10.793 --> 37:14.144
I don't know. I feel
really weird about it.

37:14.232 --> 37:18.061
OK. Why don't you and me
figure it out together?

37:29.943 --> 37:30.422
Violet: You OK?

37:31.597 --> 37:32.772
Yeah.

37:32.902 --> 37:33.729
Isn't your car
parked over there?

37:35.862 --> 37:37.385
I just want to
grab a coffee.

37:44.740 --> 37:45.785
I have to ask.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.178
Does Scott have a
history of infidelity?

37:48.309 --> 37:52.618
No. At least... not
that I was aware of.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.750
Leila was born out
of wedlock, right?

37:54.837 --> 37:56.796
Does that mean that Scott was
cheating on his first wife?

37:56.883 --> 37:59.451
No, Leila was conceived
before Scott's marriage.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.801
Remind me, how did the
two of you get together?

38:01.931 --> 38:03.890
We met at a charity event

38:03.977 --> 38:05.587
Yeah, but he was still
married at the time.

38:05.674 --> 38:07.633
God, no! His wife had
already passed away.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.115
Are you trying to insinuate
that I committed adultery?

38:12.202 --> 38:13.900
I'm just doing my
job, Mrs. Hyatt.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.293
Gathering information.

38:15.423 --> 38:16.468
But if we can
find evidence

38:16.555 --> 38:18.208
that your husband was
having an affair,

38:18.339 --> 38:19.471
it gives us a good
lead on this case.

38:21.603 --> 38:23.910
OK. Thank you.

38:24.040 --> 38:24.998
-Thank you, Mrs. Hyatt.

38:38.098 --> 38:41.275
Hey, Hazel!
This is Leila.

38:41.406 --> 38:42.494
It's very nice
to meet you.

38:42.581 --> 38:43.930
You, too.

38:44.017 --> 38:48.500
Um, I was wondering if we could
do that biology tutoring?

38:48.587 --> 38:50.502
Maybe it will get my
mind off of things.

38:50.589 --> 38:53.592
Great. How about tomorrow
morning? Nine-thirty?

38:53.679 --> 38:54.506
Perfect.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.030
I'll see you, girls.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.602
My dad hired her
after my mom died.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.126
She was like our rock.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.433
When did your
mom pass away?

39:08.520 --> 39:10.260
Two years ago.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.481
And then Dad started dating
Nora six months later.

39:13.568 --> 39:17.703
So, Nora and your dad
weren't married very long?

39:17.790 --> 39:19.182
He proposed
really quickly.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.838
That must have
been hard for you,

39:22.925 --> 39:26.320
to lose your mom and then
your dad remarried so soon.

39:26.451 --> 39:31.281
Yeah. Nora's fine. I never
really gave her a chance.

39:31.369 --> 39:35.677
I was more pissed off at my
dad for remarrying so quickly.

39:36.852 --> 39:39.377
Oh, he was working
a lot, and then

39:39.464 --> 39:42.858
when he'd come home,
I'd try to punish him.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.382
So I wouldn't hang
out with him.

39:46.427 --> 39:53.347
But now... I just...

39:53.434 --> 39:55.871
I wish that I did things
differently, that's all.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.225
Can I give you a hug?

40:27.076 --> 40:28.295
Come in.

40:28.382 --> 40:29.122
Can we talk?

40:35.650 --> 40:40.699
Honey, I hesitate even
asking you this, but...

40:40.786 --> 40:43.179
What is it?

40:43.266 --> 40:46.356
Do you think there
was any possibility

40:46.444 --> 40:47.967
that your dad was
having an affair?

40:51.318 --> 40:55.235
Uh, no I don't think so.

40:55.322 --> 40:58.891
So, you're uh,
you're not sure?

40:58.978 --> 41:01.415
Did he say
something to you?

41:01.502 --> 41:04.070
-Dad would never talk to
me about this kinda stuff.

41:04.157 --> 41:10.032
Right. I'm sorry
for even asking.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.599
It's just that the detective
thinks it could be

41:11.730 --> 41:14.297
a real possibility.

41:14.384 --> 41:19.302
-Well,
I don't know. So...

41:35.144 --> 41:37.190
Do you want to go
somewhere and talk?

41:37.320 --> 41:37.669
Where?

41:39.192 --> 41:41.368
I don't even care where.

41:41.455 --> 41:43.979
It just feels like this
house is closing in on me.

41:44.066 --> 41:44.980
Maybe the park
up the street?8

41:55.774 --> 41:57.993
So what was
Dad like?

42:04.260 --> 42:10.484
He was.... When he walked
into a room, he lit it up.

42:10.571 --> 42:15.228
Everyone loved him.

42:15.315 --> 42:19.493
When I was younger then,
we had so much fun.

42:19.624 --> 42:22.017
We went on a lot of family
trips. I think we visited

42:22.104 --> 42:24.324
like, fifteen
countries or something.

42:24.454 --> 42:28.458
Wow, that's incredible.

42:28.589 --> 42:30.983
You said that your mom
wasn't around a lot?

42:31.070 --> 42:34.769
She was an addict, a
functioning one for a while,

42:34.856 --> 42:38.556
but uh, child services
took me away when I was

42:38.643 --> 42:41.733
around ten and put
me into foster care.

42:41.820 --> 42:42.560
Where is she now?

42:45.867 --> 42:48.870
She overdosed when I
was about your age.

42:53.571 --> 42:54.528
I feel so terrible
for everything

42:54.659 --> 42:55.747
that you've been through.

42:59.315 --> 43:00.578
I've been taking
everything for granted.

43:03.624 --> 43:06.409
What do you mean?

43:06.496 --> 43:09.630
I told you how I treated
Dad this past year.

43:09.761 --> 43:14.853
I made his life so
difficult. And now...

43:19.640 --> 43:21.599
I'll never be able to
tell him I'm sorry.

43:24.471 --> 43:27.213
You're not alone.

43:27.300 --> 43:32.218
We all have things we wish
we'd done differently.

43:32.305 --> 43:36.526
I've experienced a lot of
loss and a lot of regrets

43:36.614 --> 43:38.833
in my life.

43:38.920 --> 43:42.358
And one thing I like to
do is write a letter.

43:42.489 --> 43:44.491
When you're having a
hard time letting go

43:44.622 --> 43:47.102
of the guilt, you
put it into words

43:47.189 --> 43:48.756
and put the letter
in a special place.

43:55.458 --> 43:56.503
I like that.

44:02.117 --> 44:03.771
I'm really happy
that you're here.

44:07.383 --> 44:08.776
Me too.

44:51.036 --> 44:52.211
Brad: Hey, Leila.

44:52.298 --> 44:54.300
I think that guy you
owe money to might know

44:54.430 --> 44:56.781
where I'm staying. You
need to deal with this now.

44:56.868 --> 44:58.043
OK, OK, I'll see
what I can do.

45:02.874 --> 45:04.702
Man: I'm getting
impatient, Brad.

45:04.789 --> 45:07.269
Listen, just back off; she
has nothing to do with this.

45:07.356 --> 45:10.098
I'm not gonna back off until
you give me a reason to.

45:10.185 --> 45:13.406
But... Shut up. Get me what you
owe...or she pays the price.

45:23.242 --> 45:24.069
Peter?

45:25.374 --> 45:27.855
-I just got the news
about Scott!

45:27.942 --> 45:30.336
I'm sorry it took so long
for me to get back to you

45:30.423 --> 45:32.860
but the reception in
the desert is terrible.

45:32.947 --> 45:34.819
But I'm in Dubai now.

45:34.949 --> 45:36.472
-There is so much I need
to discuss with you

45:36.559 --> 45:37.996
as soon as possible.

45:38.083 --> 45:41.695
-Of course. And the police
still don't have any leads?

45:41.826 --> 45:45.786
-No. But, apparently there
was a woman at the scene,

45:45.917 --> 45:47.962
someone he was with
before he died.

45:48.093 --> 45:49.877
-Really?

45:49.964 --> 45:53.098
-Peter, you've known
Scott a long time.

45:53.185 --> 45:56.275
Did... did he mention
anyone to you?

45:56.362 --> 45:58.146
Someone he might've
been training with?

45:58.277 --> 46:00.192
Or... someone he
might've been seeing.

46:00.279 --> 46:03.543
-I wish I knew something, Nora.

46:03.673 --> 46:06.459
Listen, I'm ending my trip
early and heading home.

46:06.546 --> 46:08.896
I've a long flight, but
as soon as I get back,

46:08.983 --> 46:11.551
we can talk about everything.

46:11.638 --> 46:12.944
-Thank you, Peter.

46:20.081 --> 46:21.474
Violet, have you
heard from Hazel?

46:23.084 --> 46:23.781
No.

46:25.130 --> 46:26.522
She said she'd be at
the house by eight.

46:26.653 --> 46:28.089
It's almost ten.

46:28.176 --> 46:30.135
She was supposed to
tutor me this morning.

46:30.222 --> 46:31.092
She's never late.

46:38.491 --> 46:40.145
Hey, it's Hazel. Please
leave a message.

47:00.078 --> 47:03.777
Hey, I was just making
breakfast for you and Nora.

47:03.908 --> 47:05.474
Sorry, I gotta run.

47:05.605 --> 47:07.694
But um, I'll eat
when I get back.

47:11.872 --> 47:14.048
Hazel is still not answering.

47:14.179 --> 47:15.571
Violet: I'm just gonna
head over there now.

47:15.702 --> 47:17.269
That's a good idea.
I'll drive you.

47:17.356 --> 47:19.097
We'll be back
soon, Leila.

47:19.184 --> 47:20.315
Thank you for making breakfast.

47:56.221 --> 47:58.614
Hi! Are you a
family member?

47:58.745 --> 48:00.834
Yeah, I'm Leila.

48:00.921 --> 48:04.359
Lovely! Maya. Nice to meet
you. I'm the neighbor.

48:04.446 --> 48:06.361
How's Nora doing?

48:06.448 --> 48:09.712
She's holding up OK.
It's hard, of course.

48:09.843 --> 48:12.672
Yes. She should
be back soon.

48:12.759 --> 48:14.848
Do you want me to let
her know you stopped by?

48:14.935 --> 48:17.546
Uh, I don't
think she wants me around.

48:17.633 --> 48:19.331
Really, why?

48:19.418 --> 48:22.116
Oh, it's a long story.

48:22.203 --> 48:24.031
You should come over
for wine sometime.

48:24.162 --> 48:25.598
I'm just around the bend.

48:25.728 --> 48:27.426
House fifty-six twenty-three.

48:27.513 --> 48:29.297
OK. Yeah?
maybe I will.

48:29.384 --> 48:31.952
Perfect! Bye!

48:32.083 --> 48:33.040
Bye.

48:55.758 --> 48:57.456
Her car is parked.
She should be home.

49:03.810 --> 49:04.811
I know where the
spare key is.

49:04.898 --> 49:05.943
OK, get it.

49:21.306 --> 49:22.133
Hazel!

49:25.832 --> 49:27.486
You go check upstairs;
I'll check down here.

49:34.058 --> 49:38.671
Hazel? Hazel, are you here?

49:47.680 --> 49:49.682
Hazel? Norah!

49:51.553 --> 49:53.294
Hazel! Hazel, wake up.

50:01.911 --> 50:03.000
The necklace.

50:05.785 --> 50:07.004
What happened?

50:07.091 --> 50:08.005
Oh, my God!

50:09.789 --> 50:11.182
Violet? We need to call 911.

50:13.053 --> 50:14.011
This is Hazel's phone.

50:19.103 --> 50:23.716
"Scott and I were having an
affair. He broke it off.

50:23.846 --> 50:27.415
I was so angry. It
was an accident.

50:27.502 --> 50:29.765
I didn't mean to kill him.

50:29.852 --> 50:32.507
I can't live with the
guilt of what I've done."

50:43.649 --> 50:44.998
Leila: Did you ever think
something was going on

50:45.129 --> 50:46.043
between Hazel and Dad?

50:49.307 --> 50:51.483
Not at all.

50:51.570 --> 50:53.224
How long do you think they
were having an affair?

50:55.574 --> 50:56.575
Pretty recent.

50:59.143 --> 51:02.407
Hazel had a serious boyfriend
up until six months ago.

51:05.497 --> 51:09.457
I knew Hazel really well.

51:09.544 --> 51:12.504
She was like a
part of the family.

51:12.634 --> 51:17.987
I just... I can't believe
that she would hurt anyone,

51:18.075 --> 51:19.206
especially not Dad.

51:22.166 --> 51:25.212
She overdosed, right?
The cops said so?

51:25.299 --> 51:32.219
Yeah, but something
doesn't add up.

51:32.306 --> 51:35.831
The necklace that
Dad bought in secret,

51:35.918 --> 51:38.356
she was wearing it.

51:38.443 --> 51:39.835
But on the receipt,
it said that

51:39.922 --> 51:45.058
it was only bought
like a week ago.

51:45.145 --> 51:47.843
Why would he buy
her a necklace

51:47.930 --> 51:49.236
if he was gonna
break up with her?

51:53.980 --> 51:55.199
You think I'm crazy?

51:55.286 --> 52:01.466
No, you're making sense.
What do you want to do?

52:07.950 --> 52:11.302
There was a journal
in Hazel's room.

52:11.432 --> 52:13.869
And I really wanted
to grab it,

52:13.956 --> 52:17.786
but then, Nora and
the cops came in.

52:17.873 --> 52:19.136
So you want to go
back and get it?

52:21.225 --> 52:24.141
Yeah, I do.

52:41.158 --> 52:44.813
Nora, let me help
you with that.

52:44.900 --> 52:46.250
This is a bunch of
stuff for clients

52:46.337 --> 52:48.687
that Hazel was
helping me with.

52:52.647 --> 52:56.608
I'm so sorry about
everything that's happened.

52:56.695 --> 53:00.829
This all feels like a dream.
Or rather, like a nightmare.

53:00.916 --> 53:03.136
If there's anything
I can do to pitch in,

53:03.223 --> 53:05.225
it would be my pleasure.

53:05.312 --> 53:07.445
That's actually
not a bad idea.

53:07.532 --> 53:10.491
I'll need someone to
fill Hazel's position.

53:10.578 --> 53:12.145
We can talk about
it more tomorrow,

53:12.276 --> 53:13.320
but if you
don't mind,

53:13.407 --> 53:15.017
there's a few errands
I need to get done.

53:15.104 --> 53:16.541
Of course,
whatever you need.

54:10.508 --> 54:11.552
Brad: Hi.

54:11.639 --> 54:12.945
Someone is following me.

54:13.032 --> 54:14.033
I told you, I need your...

54:14.163 --> 54:15.339
Get this guy off my back!

54:15.426 --> 54:16.078
Wait...

54:25.653 --> 54:26.611
Violet: Hey, Leila.

54:26.741 --> 54:29.570
Hey, I'm just
finishing a few errands

54:29.701 --> 54:30.832
and I'll pick you up. OK?

54:30.963 --> 54:32.181
OK, thanks.

54:48.850 --> 54:50.504
Violet: You good?

54:50.591 --> 54:52.289
-Yeah. I'll wait
here and keep watch.

55:45.559 --> 55:47.822
A three five nine.

55:52.697 --> 55:56.048
Use: for patient
after serious surgery.

57:47.333 --> 57:48.290
What are you doing here?

57:51.032 --> 57:52.991
Is that someone for me?

57:53.121 --> 57:55.994
Hi, can I help you?

57:56.081 --> 57:57.996
I'm Brad. I just moved
into the neighborhood,

57:58.126 --> 57:59.388
a few streets away.

57:59.519 --> 58:01.565
Welcome.
-Thank you.

58:01.652 --> 58:03.567
Um, I was out
for a walk

58:03.654 --> 58:06.744
and I noticed your
tire was flat.

58:06.831 --> 58:07.658
That's your
car, Leila.

58:09.964 --> 58:11.836
I'm pretty handy. I,
uh, would be happy

58:11.966 --> 58:13.533
to put the spare
on for you.

58:13.620 --> 58:14.926
That's so nice.

58:36.164 --> 58:39.080
This was the only way I'd
get you to talk to me.

58:39.167 --> 58:41.692
At least I didn't tell your
family who I really was.

58:41.822 --> 58:44.869
That's supposed to
make me feel better?

58:44.999 --> 58:47.349
Look, my contact keeps
cancelling on me.

58:47.436 --> 58:50.527
I've exhausted my
options. I need your help.

58:57.185 --> 58:58.535
That's a
fifty-thousand-dollar watch.

59:02.277 --> 59:03.888
You actually think I'm
going to steal that for you

59:04.018 --> 59:05.019
so you can pay off your debt?

59:09.154 --> 59:11.069
You said you're being followed.

59:11.199 --> 59:12.810
How long do you
think it'll take them

59:12.940 --> 59:17.728
to get to your sister?
Violet's her name, right?

59:17.858 --> 59:19.381
I'll never let
anything happen to her.

59:22.428 --> 59:23.734
You said the same
thing about Iris.

59:26.693 --> 59:28.739
Just get me the watch
by this afternoon.

59:39.314 --> 59:40.968
Gavrow Pharmacy.

59:41.099 --> 59:44.624
Hi, uh, my doctor was
called about a refill

59:44.711 --> 59:46.234
on a prescription.

59:46.321 --> 59:47.888
I was just checking
to see if you got it.

59:48.019 --> 59:49.237
Of course. Name on the account.

59:49.324 --> 59:51.109
The name is Hazel Carter.

01:00:00.814 --> 01:00:01.598
Tire all fixed?

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:04.122
Yeah.

01:00:04.252 --> 01:00:05.514
If you'd like,

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.778
we can go over the personal
assistant position now.

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.170
I need someone to
take over for Hazel

01:00:09.301 --> 01:00:11.303
as soon as possible.

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:12.957
I'd love that.

01:00:13.087 --> 01:00:15.568
Great. So your job
would essentially be

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:18.005
to keep things running
smoothly in the house and

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.529
helping out when needed in
my event-planning business.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.749
Errands, setting appointments,
travel arrangements,

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.882
driving Violet to
where she needs to be,

01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:27.580
that type of thing. If you
wanna stay here, you'll get

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.148
room and board as well as
a salary on top of that.

01:00:30.278 --> 01:00:34.500
A salary? How much?

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.371
It starts at fifty
thousand a year.

01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:38.243
Wow.

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:43.770
And when would I get
my first paycheck?

01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:44.989
Are you in need of
money right now?

01:00:46.773 --> 01:00:49.384
I owe some rent on
my old apartment

01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:51.778
and had a couple
medical bills.

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:55.390
This job will really
help with all of that.

01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:56.914
Just tell me how
much you need.

01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:59.046
I'm happy to front you the cash.

01:00:59.133 --> 01:01:01.527
Is five thousand OK?

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:05.966
Yeah. Thank
you so much, Nora.

01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:09.970
I'll go get my
check book, OK?

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.413
I just called and they
don't have a record

01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:20.720
of Hazel's prescription.

01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:23.114
Do you think there's a chance
she used a different pharmacy?

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:28.380
-Maybe. I just have a
really bad feeling that

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.991
maybe those weren't Hazel's
pills, and somebody...

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.560
...did this to her.

01:01:38.912 --> 01:01:40.697
If it wasn't Hazel
who killed him,

01:01:40.827 --> 01:01:42.568
then whoever did
this would have known

01:01:42.655 --> 01:01:44.265
that he was having
an affair...

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:47.573
and that he was running that
night and on which trail.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.880
Did someone have
it out for him?

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.360
Maybe a colleague
from work or...

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:53.361
or someone who
lives nearby?

01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:59.585
What do you know about
your neighbor, Maya?

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:03.241
Um... she's been
divorced three times.

01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:06.113
And I think she
kinda hates me.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.854
This one time I got drunk
and I cut through her yard.

01:02:10.117 --> 01:02:12.076
When I met her,

01:02:12.163 --> 01:02:14.774
she said Nora didn't
want to talk to her.

01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:16.384
What's that about?

01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:19.431
Her and Nora never
really got along.

01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:23.217
I think that she had a
bit of a crush on Dad.

01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:26.307
Do you think she had
something to do with this?

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:28.353
I can try to find out.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.107
Get in.

01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:45.196
Here.

01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:51.115
What's this?

01:02:51.202 --> 01:02:55.728
Five grand. That should help.
You can figure the rest out.

01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:57.121
And the watch?

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.427
I already told you. I'm not
stealing from my family.

01:02:59.514 --> 01:03:00.864
Or from anyone.

01:03:04.389 --> 01:03:06.652
I loved you.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.045
But if you wanna do
this the hard way...

01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:22.929
Peter: Scott was a close friend
of mine for twenty years.

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:27.107
I've watched
Violet grow up.

01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:28.935
I still can't
believe he's gone.

01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:31.155
Thank you, Peter.

01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:34.027
I think everyone is just
ready for some closure.

01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:36.203
Now that we finally know
what happened to him.

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.509
Right, Violet?

01:03:39.032 --> 01:03:40.904
I feel like I need to
address the elephant

01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:43.907
in the room. Finding out
about Hazel must have been

01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:47.606
very difficult for you,
Nora. And you too, Violet.

01:03:47.693 --> 01:03:52.654
-I feel... betrayed.
Of course.

01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:55.396
But despite everything, he
was my husband and I loved

01:03:55.483 --> 01:03:59.792
him. It's just something
I need to work through.

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:02.882
But for now, I'd like to
focus on the arrangements.

01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:05.450
I'm here for you.
For the both of you.

01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:08.453
I'll start digging into
the paperwork and uh,

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.542
we can schedule
a will-reading

01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:12.849
before the service
if you'd like.

01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:18.680
Maya: After Scott's first wife
died, we had a thing.

01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:21.422
Oh.

01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:24.382
I thought it would grow
into something more,

01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:26.514
but one night I went
to a charity event.

01:04:26.645 --> 01:04:31.693
Scott was there.
And so was Nora.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.914
Of course, they
uh, hit it off.

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:39.397
So you were upset he
started dating Nora?

01:04:39.527 --> 01:04:44.619
Surprised
is more like it.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.492
Anyway, she found out
we used to be an item

01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:49.624
and didn't want me around.

01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:52.889
Honestly? It is water
under the bridge for me.

01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:55.630
But maybe she felt
threatened. Who knows?

01:04:56.544 --> 01:04:57.545
Oh, excuse me.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.203
I'm so sorry, my security
camera is so sensitive,

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:04.726
they go off all the time.

01:05:04.813 --> 01:05:06.598
Hm.

01:05:06.728 --> 01:05:09.035
They sold me a
deluxe package.

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:11.385
Little did I know it would
turn out to be FBI-levels

01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:14.780
of surveillance.

01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:17.826
Did the police ever ask
you for your footage

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.567
from the night
Scott died?

01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:20.960
I was away on
a work trip.

01:05:21.091 --> 01:05:23.789
So, if they came
knocking, I wasn't home.

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.965
Besides, I live far enough
away from Scott's house,

01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.794
they probably wouldn't
even check here.

01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:31.449
Do you mind if I take
a look at the footage?

01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:32.929
I'm just curious.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:35.801
Sure.

01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:50.337
I'm sorry. I have to
take this. It's work.

01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:55.952
Hi, I'm in a meeting so
please make it brief.

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:00.521
Now that I have you alone,

01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:03.046
there's something
you need to know.

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:03.960
What is it?

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:10.618
What I'm about to tell
you is very confidential.

01:06:21.542 --> 01:06:24.241
Leila: Wait, can you go
back and zoom in on that car?

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.122
Violet: Yeah, that's Faith's
car. Nora's sister.

01:06:36.253 --> 01:06:37.036
Leila: You're sure?

01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:39.256
-Positive.

01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:41.432
But wasn't she watching a
movie with Nora that night?

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:43.608
That's what she said.

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:46.524
Could she have gone
for pizza or something?

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:49.614
Maybe, but her car
was gone for an hour.

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:51.398
That's a long time
for take-out.

01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:53.183
Yeah. It also
doesn't make sense.

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.011
Why would they tell the cops
that she was here all night?

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:58.144
How much do you
know about Faith?

01:07:00.712 --> 01:07:03.976
She's a special education
teacher. Married.

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:07.414
She seems...
pretty perfect.

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:08.720
Sometimes those are
the people hiding

01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:10.156
the biggest secrets.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:38.348
Stop right there!

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:39.261
No!

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:51.361
Nora! Nora, are you
OK? What's going on?

01:10:14.121 --> 01:10:15.298
It's been a long night.

01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:16.734
But at least the police
know it was self-defense.

01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:21.347
I'm really sorry.

01:10:21.434 --> 01:10:24.481
I should have told you
about Brad and his debt.

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:27.179
It's not your fault.

01:10:27.309 --> 01:10:30.182
I really did love Brad.

01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:34.491
He was a huge part of my
life for such a long time.

01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:39.583
He just got into something bad.

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:41.367
And now I'm responsible for it.

01:10:41.498 --> 01:10:44.544
No. You won't have to worry
about that much longer.

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:46.719
I'm going to pay
Brad's debt myself.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:49.201
Thank you, Nora.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:50.550
We will get through this.

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:36.814
Violet?

01:11:39.207 --> 01:11:39.991
Look what I found in
the guest bathroom.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.995
It's the same pill you
found at Hazel's house.

01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:47.912
Oh, my God!

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:48.956
We need to talk
to Faith.

01:12:22.076 --> 01:12:23.904
Faith?

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:26.080
Can I help you?

01:12:26.166 --> 01:12:27.473
I'm Leila.

01:12:29.736 --> 01:12:31.347
Listen, I'm in
a huge rush.

01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:32.609
I have a doctor's
appointment.

01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:34.306
And I won't be
back until 2:30.

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:36.134
Are you a parent?

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:37.657
There's an administrator
inside who can help you.

01:12:37.788 --> 01:12:38.832
No, I'm Scott's daughter.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.707
I'm sure Nora told
you about me.

01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:48.581
What are you
doing here?

01:12:48.668 --> 01:12:50.366
I was hoping we could
talk in private.

01:12:52.193 --> 01:12:53.673
I wanted to ask you
some questions about

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.807
what happened to my dad.

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:59.766
You don't already know?
There was a confession.

01:12:59.853 --> 01:13:02.160
Yes, but I think
there's a possibility

01:13:02.246 --> 01:13:03.248
that Hazel didn't do it.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.341
I'm sorry, uh, you need to
talk to Nora about this.

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:10.559
I really have to go.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.779
Faith, please.

01:13:12.866 --> 01:13:15.303
I know you left the
house that night.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.001
What are you
talking about?

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:20.004
One of the neighbors has
security camera footage.

01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:21.962
Your car left
the property.

01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:23.790
I haven't gone to the
cops. Not yet anyway.

01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:25.313
But I'm sure they'll
want to know why you...

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:26.097
It wasn't me.

01:13:28.055 --> 01:13:29.230
I never left the
house that night.

01:13:31.668 --> 01:13:33.539
I can't talk right now.

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:38.457
I, I misplaced my pain
medication at Nora's house.

01:13:38.588 --> 01:13:40.154
I had a really bad
fall not too long ago.

01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:42.112
Your pills are there.

01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:44.463
I found them in
the guest bathroom.

01:13:44.594 --> 01:13:46.160
Your medication...
it was the same pills

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.727
that Hazel overdosed on.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.514
Oh!

01:13:52.602 --> 01:13:55.343
Faith! Faith, please, I
just want to talk to you.

01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:57.607
Faith, I just wanna talk!

01:14:07.573 --> 01:14:09.183
Violet: Do you think that
she'll call Nora and tell her?

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.446
I hope not.

01:14:10.532 --> 01:14:12.448
What if she doesn't
come back to the school?

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:14.928
-She said she'll be
back at 2:30.

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:18.018
OK. I think Nora's coming.

01:14:18.105 --> 01:14:19.933
OK. I'll let you go.

01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:26.374
Peter is coming over for the
will-reading around six.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:27.898
Really?

01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:29.290
Mm.

01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:33.730
So soon? Shouldn't we wait
till after Dad's service?

01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:35.079
There's no need
to do that.

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:38.125
It's better to take care of
it now for legal reasons.

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:52.966
Please, Leila,
I can't talk.

01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:57.057
Faith, your medication was
found in Hazel's bedroom.

01:14:57.144 --> 01:15:00.103
She overdosed on
those exact pills.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:02.802
Your car left Nora's house
the night Scott died,

01:15:02.889 --> 01:15:04.500
but you told the police you
were there the entire time.

01:15:07.677 --> 01:15:08.852
I fell asleep.

01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:24.563
What
time is it?

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.652
It's still early.
You fell asleep.

01:15:26.782 --> 01:15:29.829
Oh, I feel
so groggy.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.309
You did have some wine.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.269
Geez, what kind
of wine was it?

01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:36.532
The expensive kind.

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:43.190
Ah. Did I miss
the whole movie?

01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:44.844
You fell asleep
about ten minutes in.

01:15:44.931 --> 01:15:47.847
Was it any good?

01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:49.196
I wouldn't give
it five stars,

01:15:49.282 --> 01:15:50.807
but the ending
was decent.

01:15:50.894 --> 01:15:52.852
What happened?

01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:54.245
You want me
to spoil it?

01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:56.682
Go for it. I
won't watch it.

01:15:56.769 --> 01:16:00.338
OK, so the
lead character Sandy...

01:16:00.468 --> 01:16:02.253
she's got this obsession.

01:16:04.603 --> 01:16:07.606
She told me the entire
plot of the movie.

01:16:07.693 --> 01:16:09.085
Is it possible that
she watched it already?

01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:14.047
Faith, do you think
Nora drugged you?

01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:17.268
What? No, she
wouldn't...

01:16:24.492 --> 01:16:25.450
Huh.

01:16:41.771 --> 01:16:43.686
She told me to park the car
at the end of the driveway

01:16:43.816 --> 01:16:45.557
to make room for Scott.

01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:46.818
Maybe she did
that on purpose

01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:49.430
so her security camera
wouldn't pick up your car.

01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:51.911
I thought I left my
medication behind

01:16:51.998 --> 01:16:55.436
by accident. But I always
keep it in my purse.

01:16:55.567 --> 01:16:58.264
Nora could have
taken it.

01:16:58.352 --> 01:17:00.398
Do you really
think that she planned

01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:01.617
this from the beginning?

01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:06.447
She invited you
into town, right?

01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:09.929
Yes.

01:17:10.016 --> 01:17:12.148
Maybe she figured you'd
make a good alibi.

01:17:13.889 --> 01:17:16.632
She was right...
until now.

01:17:20.723 --> 01:17:21.505
Hi, Violet.

01:17:26.554 --> 01:17:27.817
Peter, thank you
for coming over.

01:17:27.904 --> 01:17:28.644
Of course.

01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:35.825
Oh, um... I
gotta take this.

01:17:35.912 --> 01:17:38.088
OK.

01:17:38.218 --> 01:17:39.045
Do you wanna come in?

01:17:39.132 --> 01:17:40.177
Yeah! OK.

01:17:42.222 --> 01:17:43.267
What's happening?

01:17:43.397 --> 01:17:45.704
Leila: I'm almost there.
Did Peter arrive?

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:48.751
Violet: Yeah. He just got
here. What about Faith?

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:49.665
She's with me.

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:54.321
Thank God you
convinced her to come.

01:17:54.452 --> 01:17:56.672
Just try to keep things
normal until I get there, OK?

01:17:58.237 --> 01:18:00.414
Yeah, I can do that.

01:18:00.545 --> 01:18:01.502
I'll see you soon.

01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:08.858
You're doing the
right thing, Faith.

01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:17.344
Violet, would you mind

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:19.737
giving us a few
moments alone, please?

01:18:19.869 --> 01:18:20.826
Sure.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.316
Nora, before we get
to the will-reading,

01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:35.536
there's something important
that you should know.

01:18:41.934 --> 01:18:43.327
I can't do this.

01:18:43.414 --> 01:18:45.938
I was going to call you, but
I thought it would be better

01:18:46.068 --> 01:18:48.680
to have this
conversation in person.

01:18:48.811 --> 01:18:50.334
Peter, you're scaring me.

01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:53.684
She's my sister. How can
I look her in the eye?

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.339
You know what
she did to you.

01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:58.168
And I already gave this
information to the police.

01:18:58.298 --> 01:18:59.212
What information?

01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:06.350
Scott contacted me a week
before I went on vacation

01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:08.091
and wanted to revise the will.

01:19:11.007 --> 01:19:12.878
What did he want to change?

01:19:12.965 --> 01:19:15.141
I promised to
always protect her.

01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:17.100
Faith, please.

01:19:19.102 --> 01:19:23.584
He requested that
everything goes to Violet.

01:19:26.413 --> 01:19:29.112
I find that a
little hard to believe.

01:19:29.242 --> 01:19:30.983
He never discussed it with me.

01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:33.725
I know this must be
difficult for you to hear.

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:36.902
My husband had an affair
and cut me out of his will?

01:19:37.032 --> 01:19:39.992
I would say that "difficult"
is an understatement, Peter.

01:19:40.123 --> 01:19:42.125
Leila: Faith, we can't
do this without you.

01:19:54.005 --> 01:19:55.486
I'm very sorry, Nora.

01:19:55.616 --> 01:19:57.314
I know this must
all come as a shock.

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:04.495
Leila, this is not
a good time.

01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:05.888
It's over, Nora.

01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:08.541
What are you talking about?

01:20:13.286 --> 01:20:14.635
I know that you
killed my dad.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.552
How could you say
something like that?

01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:21.686
Violet, tell me
what's going on.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.471
Nora knew about my dad's
affair this whole time.

01:20:24.602 --> 01:20:25.516
Peter, that
is not true.

01:20:25.603 --> 01:20:28.388
Don't believe her.
She's just a child.

01:20:28.519 --> 01:20:32.349
Leila: A child, huh? You
mean a kid who figured out

01:20:32.436 --> 01:20:37.093
the truth about you, our dad,
Hazel. Drugging your own sister.

01:20:37.223 --> 01:20:40.183
How could you accuse me
of such terrible things?

01:20:41.749 --> 01:20:43.577
No, I am your stepmother.

01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:46.014
I've done everything for you.

01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:49.148
And you... I took you
in. I welcomed you

01:20:49.235 --> 01:20:51.107
into this family. I gave
you a place to stay!

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:52.237
And paid off your
boyfriend's debt!

01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:54.980
You played the role of
a betrayed, grieving,

01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:58.201
selfless widow. But now
we all know the truth.

01:20:58.331 --> 01:21:01.639
Peter, isn't it obvious
what is going on here?

01:21:01.726 --> 01:21:04.728
These two, they are after me.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.296
Nora.

01:21:06.383 --> 01:21:08.210
Violet was always
a troublemaker.

01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:10.213
Scott and I even
discussed sending her

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.693
to one of those
rehabilitation centers.

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.870
They're working together;

01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:17.698
they're trying to
take Scott's money.

01:21:17.785 --> 01:21:19.787
They set me up.

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:22.181
Scott has been a family
friend for a long time.

01:21:22.268 --> 01:21:25.576
He wanted Violet
to have everything.

01:21:28.144 --> 01:21:32.103
But he didn't have time to
change the will, did he? Hm?

01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:34.541
So let's proceed
with the reading.

01:21:34.628 --> 01:21:38.589
Scott changed his will with
my partner before he died.

01:21:38.675 --> 01:21:41.200
Nora, it's done.

01:22:14.494 --> 01:22:15.278
No!

01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:19.456
Hey!

01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:23.677
Don't you ever touch
my sister again!

01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:25.288
I knew nothing good would come

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.550
the moment you showed up.

01:22:26.637 --> 01:22:27.725
Nora!

01:22:29.466 --> 01:22:30.554
Stop!

01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:37.648
Faith, what are you doing here?

01:22:39.476 --> 01:22:42.566
I called 911.

01:22:42.653 --> 01:22:44.133
Faith!

01:22:46.657 --> 01:22:49.225
Why would you do this?

01:22:49.355 --> 01:22:50.487
Scott did this to me.

01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:57.798
He wanted to destroy
me. I had to do this.

01:23:01.193 --> 01:23:05.110
Faith, we have been through
the worst of times together.

01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:07.591
And we both, we both
do whatever it takes.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:15.860
Nora. I am nothing like you.

01:23:18.906 --> 01:23:26.175
Faith. No. Please.

01:23:55.594 --> 01:23:57.293
Your official key.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.077
I already have one.

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:02.037
I know, but it's so much
more fun handing it over.

01:24:04.255 --> 01:24:06.171
Here. This is for you.

01:24:08.521 --> 01:24:12.525
So? What's next for
the Hyatt sisters?

01:24:12.612 --> 01:24:14.875
Well, besides living
here together,

01:24:14.962 --> 01:24:17.052
Violet's graduating
high school soon

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:19.793
and going to college
here in Philly.

01:24:19.924 --> 01:24:22.013
And I just enrolled in school

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:24.668
to get my real estate license.

01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:26.931
That's incredible, girls.

01:24:27.018 --> 01:24:29.499
Who knows? Maybe we'll both
own a real estate company

01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:30.717
one day just like Dad.

01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:36.245
The Hyatt Sisters has a nice
ring to it, right, sis?

01:24:39.422 --> 01:24:41.772
Your father would be
so proud of you, girls!

01:24:43.904 --> 01:24:45.080
Bring it in.

01:24:47.386 --> 01:24:49.258
You two take care
of each other, OK?

01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:53.436
Bye.

01:24:58.571 --> 01:24:59.224
What's that?

01:25:02.314 --> 01:25:05.665
I took your advice, and I
wrote down all the things

01:25:05.752 --> 01:25:07.450
that I really wanted to
say to Dad before he died.

01:25:09.539 --> 01:25:12.107
It really helped. Thanks.

01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:20.289
Do you wanna hear
what I wrote to Dad?

01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:23.596
I'd love that.

01:25:24.858 --> 01:25:28.732
OK.

01:25:31.952 --> 01:25:35.478
Dad. Our memories
together will forever be

01:25:35.565 --> 01:25:40.047
my favorite place. I'll
keep them close to my heart

01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:44.182
always and use them as
a source of strength.

01:25:44.269 --> 01:25:46.358
I will walk down my
wedding aisle alone,

01:25:46.489 --> 01:25:50.928
imagining you holding my
arm. When I have kids,

01:25:51.014 --> 01:25:53.931
they will know you
from the first moment.

01:25:54.061 --> 01:25:57.456
How incredibly loved you
were and dearly missed.

01:25:57.543 --> 01:26:00.459
I promise to be everything
you hoped for me,

01:26:00.546 --> 01:26:02.679
and I'll be strong,
caring and determined.

01:26:05.943 --> 01:26:07.901
Leila and I will take
care of each other

01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:10.339
and grow together.

01:26:10.469 --> 01:26:13.472
I love you more than
I could express.

01:26:13.603 --> 01:26:17.868
This is not goodbye. Simply
until we meet again. Bye.
