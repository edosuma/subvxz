00:00.071 --> 00:02.499
<i>Hi. I'm Chuck. Here's a few</i>
<i>things you might need to know.</i>

00:02.500 --> 00:03.801
<i>I programmed it to remove</i>

00:03.868 --> 00:05.007
<i>the Intersect from Chuck's head.</i>

00:05.337 --> 00:07.438
It's over, Chuck.
The Intersect is out.

00:07.505 --> 00:08.339
You're a spy, Chuck?

00:08.406 --> 00:09.306
Yeah, more or less, yeah.

00:09.374 --> 00:10.274
Awesome!

00:10.342 --> 00:11.642
Don't you have a dream, Morgan?

00:11.710 --> 00:13.043
I'd like to be
a Benihana chef.

00:13.111 --> 00:14.778
Morgan out.
- You're free, Morgan!

00:16.815 --> 00:17.915
Chuck, where have you been?

00:17.983 --> 00:18.949
I was getting your
wedding present.

00:19.017 --> 00:19.850
Dad...

00:23.088 --> 00:24.288
Where're you headed?

00:24.356 --> 00:25.789
Burbank.

00:25.857 --> 00:26.790
<i>Got a wedding to go to.</i>

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

01:00.492 --> 01:02.092
Hmm, thank you for joining us.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.062
Emmett, I've waited
a long time for this day.

01:05.129 --> 01:06.997
Thought of so many ways
I could say it out loud

01:07.065 --> 01:08.732
and how it'd finally feel
to get it off of my chest.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.335
Let me stop you, Chuck.

01:11.403 --> 01:14.138
I am incredibly flattered.

01:14.205 --> 01:16.073
But I am a

01:16.141 --> 01:18.108
flaming heterosexual.

01:19.844 --> 01:20.844
What?

01:20.912 --> 01:22.312
What?

01:22.380 --> 01:23.847
No, no, I'm, I'm,
I'm out of here.

01:23.915 --> 01:25.049
I'm, I'm done.

01:25.116 --> 01:28.185
Well, leaving is not the answer.

01:28.253 --> 01:31.288
I am just touched that
you are taking it so hard.

01:31.356 --> 01:32.690
Emmett, you don't understand!

01:32.757 --> 01:33.857
I quit!

01:33.925 --> 01:35.059
No more Buy More.

01:35.126 --> 01:36.727
No more you.

01:36.795 --> 01:38.395
You can take your
flag and your job

01:38.463 --> 01:39.663
and shove it.

01:39.731 --> 01:41.298
Ditto.

01:46.538 --> 01:47.738
Just what do you think

01:47.806 --> 01:49.573
you're gonna do for
the rest of your life?!

01:52.010 --> 01:53.277
Anything I want.

01:53.344 --> 01:54.411
<i>Chuck,</i>

01:54.479 --> 01:55.979
what are your plans
for the future?

01:56.047 --> 01:58.348
Well, I was gonna get
a good champagne buzz

01:58.416 --> 02:00.651
going on at my sister's wedding

02:00.719 --> 02:01.919
followed by a
nice extra-long

02:01.986 --> 02:03.287
slow dance with my date.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.324
Vocationally speaking?

02:08.393 --> 02:10.761
Oh, that, no, nothing,
nothing lined up just yet.

02:10.829 --> 02:13.630
How would you feel about working
on the new Intersect project?

02:13.698 --> 02:17.034
Your government has been
rebuilding its own Intersect.

02:17.102 --> 02:18.535
You've shown real promise.

02:18.603 --> 02:20.137
We'd like you to be an analyst.

02:20.205 --> 02:22.706
Your country is calling
you, Mr. Bartowski.

02:22.774 --> 02:24.007
Uh, well, then

02:24.075 --> 02:25.743
I think my country might
have the wrong number,

02:25.810 --> 02:27.144
'cause I'm just

02:27.212 --> 02:28.779
Chuck Bartowski, not a hero.

02:30.381 --> 02:32.483
Very well.

02:32.550 --> 02:34.785
I guess that concludes
Project Bartowski.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.720
Colonel Casey, please issue

02:36.788 --> 02:39.022
Mr. Bartowski his final papers

02:39.090 --> 02:40.891
before you and your
Special Forces team

02:40.959 --> 02:42.159
ship out to Waziristan.

02:43.361 --> 02:44.995
Agent Walker,

02:45.063 --> 02:46.530
I'll need you for
just a moment more.

02:54.239 --> 02:55.706
What exactly is this?

02:55.774 --> 02:57.107
It's your pay packet, numbnuts.

03:00.211 --> 03:01.879
Hi-yo! Whoa!

03:01.946 --> 03:03.180
Yeah, you know, if you
were a true patriot,

03:03.248 --> 03:04.281
you wouldn't even cash it.

03:09.220 --> 03:10.154
Casey?

03:10.221 --> 03:11.955
Hmm?

03:12.023 --> 03:14.358
Thank you for saving my life

03:14.425 --> 03:16.293
at least once a week.
Hmm.

03:19.264 --> 03:20.697
See?

03:20.765 --> 03:23.167
Guys can hug.

03:23.234 --> 03:24.868
Not if they don't
have their man parts.

03:24.936 --> 03:26.303
That's a good point.

03:29.541 --> 03:30.774
You've done good work here.

03:30.842 --> 03:32.910
Thank you.

03:37.482 --> 03:38.916
It's in case
of emergencies.

03:38.983 --> 03:40.517
My personal number, but, uh,

03:40.585 --> 03:43.587
your fingers better be
on fire when you're dialing.

03:45.623 --> 03:46.924
<i>Agent Walker,</i>

03:46.991 --> 03:48.425
I'm sure you'll be
pleased to know

03:48.493 --> 03:50.561
you're in charge of the
new Intersect project,

03:50.628 --> 03:52.596
working in tandem
with Agent Larkin.

03:52.664 --> 03:53.697
And this time,
the Intersect

03:53.765 --> 03:55.465
goes in my head.
- Bryce?

03:55.533 --> 03:58.168
Now that we've got the Cube,

03:58.236 --> 04:00.003
it's ready for upload.

04:00.071 --> 04:01.672
You leave for Zurich together

04:01.739 --> 04:03.473
at 0800.

04:03.541 --> 04:05.843
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

04:05.910 --> 04:08.679
Walker and Larkin...

04:08.746 --> 04:10.347
together again.

04:10.415 --> 04:13.684
Finally, you can
get out of here.

04:31.169 --> 04:32.636
# Na-na na-na na-na #

04:32.704 --> 04:35.572
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

04:35.640 --> 04:37.174
# Na-na na-na na-na #

04:37.242 --> 04:38.842
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

04:38.910 --> 04:40.377
# Na-na na-na na-na #

04:40.445 --> 04:43.680
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

05:09.165 --> 05:10.399
Hey.
- Hey.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.767
Everything is going
to be perfect.

05:11.835 --> 05:13.602
I even had your Toyota
washed for you, man.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.504
Oh, perfect, thanks, bro.

05:17.607 --> 05:19.141
Oh, uh, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

05:26.015 --> 05:28.350
Just a second.

05:28.418 --> 05:30.386
Hi, can I talk to my sister?

05:30.453 --> 05:31.553
It will only take a second.
- Oh, no, Chuck.

05:31.621 --> 05:32.921
It's bad luck to
see the bride...

05:32.989 --> 05:36.125
It's fine, I don't
believe in that stuff.

05:36.192 --> 05:37.860
All right, just get in, get in.

05:37.927 --> 05:39.728
Get in, get in!

05:42.899 --> 05:45.968
Hi.

05:46.035 --> 05:47.436
What?

05:47.504 --> 05:49.471
Look at you.

05:49.539 --> 05:50.739
Ellie, your dreams
are coming true.

05:50.807 --> 05:52.107
If it were up to me,

05:52.175 --> 05:54.943
I would have a small
ceremony on a beach.

05:55.011 --> 05:57.246
Sand between my toes,
people I love.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.982
But we all make sacrifices
for family, right?

06:00.049 --> 06:01.750
One, two, three...

06:01.818 --> 06:03.585
Where the hell is my blonde?

06:03.653 --> 06:05.320
Anyway, uh...

06:05.388 --> 06:07.089
I don't know exactly yet

06:07.157 --> 06:08.891
what I'm going to get you
for your wedding present.

06:08.958 --> 06:11.860
But I'll start with this:

06:11.928 --> 06:13.896
I quit the Buy More today.

06:13.963 --> 06:15.264
What?!

06:16.533 --> 06:18.200
The Buy More is no more.

06:18.268 --> 06:20.903
Oh, Chuck, that is...
that is incredible.

06:20.970 --> 06:23.038
What are you going to
do with your future?

06:23.106 --> 06:24.239
I don't know.

06:24.307 --> 06:26.308
Oh, there she is!

06:31.714 --> 06:33.682
I made my dreams
come true, Chuck.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.818
What are you gonna
do about yours?

06:38.288 --> 06:40.355
<i>Sarah, can we</i>
<i>talk for a moment?</i>

06:43.259 --> 06:44.660
Look, I wanted to tell...
- Oh, uh...

06:44.727 --> 06:46.528
Ellie wanted me to make sure
that you have the rings.

06:46.596 --> 06:48.864
Yeah, right.

06:54.871 --> 06:57.473
You look like a real spy.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.008
You look like a real bridesmaid.

07:05.181 --> 07:07.516
Sarah, I...
- Wait, uh...

07:07.584 --> 07:09.051
There's something that
I have to tell you.

07:09.118 --> 07:11.086
I can't wait.

07:11.154 --> 07:12.688
I can't wait,
I can't wait any longer.

07:12.755 --> 07:14.089
Okay, everyone keeps asking me

07:14.157 --> 07:15.357
what I'm going to
do with my future,

07:15.425 --> 07:17.793
and the truth is,
I don't have a clue.

07:17.861 --> 07:20.362
All I do know is that
I want you to be in it.

07:20.430 --> 07:21.396
Please, I really
have to tell you.

07:21.464 --> 07:22.498
No.

07:22.565 --> 07:24.633
No guns, no lies,

07:24.701 --> 07:27.402
just us.

07:27.470 --> 07:30.439
Just like I've
always wanted it.

07:30.507 --> 07:32.407
I've recently come into
a little bit of money.

07:32.475 --> 07:33.909
So, any place you want to go,

07:33.977 --> 07:36.645
any place at all as
long as it's sunny,

07:36.713 --> 07:39.515
with little umbrella drinks.

07:39.582 --> 07:42.951
What I'm getting at here is...

07:44.187 --> 07:47.022
Sarah Walker, will
you do me the honor

07:47.090 --> 07:50.726
of taking a vacation with me?

07:52.996 --> 07:54.563
Chuck, I'm leaving
in the morning.

07:56.766 --> 07:58.867
The details are classified

07:58.935 --> 08:01.904
but I'm working on the
new Intersect project

08:01.971 --> 08:03.839
with Bryce.

08:05.808 --> 08:06.675
Bryce.

08:07.844 --> 08:09.378
I-I'm so sorry.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.680
I wanted to wait until after
the ceremony to tell you.

08:18.187 --> 08:22.558
Thank you for coming
to the wedding.

08:22.625 --> 08:25.127
Good for the cover.

08:34.837 --> 08:37.272
Today's a day we'll
remember forever, son.

09:20.216 --> 09:21.583
Oh, my God!

09:23.553 --> 09:25.854
I believe we've met before.

09:25.922 --> 09:27.889
Ted Roark.

09:27.957 --> 09:30.726
No, I'm Ted Roark.

09:30.793 --> 09:33.028
You're the CIA agent
who's in deep trouble.

09:33.096 --> 09:35.430
By the way,

09:35.498 --> 09:38.300
congratulations on your
sister's happy day.

09:38.368 --> 09:40.636
Her gown is gorgeous.

09:40.703 --> 09:43.038
Full bodice, love the beading.

09:43.106 --> 09:45.507
What the hell do you want?

09:45.575 --> 09:48.210
Ooh, there's no need to curse.

09:48.277 --> 09:50.779
You know damn well what I want.

09:50.847 --> 09:52.881
I...

09:52.949 --> 09:55.250
I want the Intersect Cube.

09:55.318 --> 09:58.453
I-I can't, I can't,
I can't give you that.

09:58.521 --> 10:00.188
Oh, you'll find a way, I'm sure.

10:05.528 --> 10:07.129
Oh, sorry, I forgot
the threat part.

10:07.196 --> 10:09.665
If you don't deliver that
Cube within a half hour,

10:09.732 --> 10:12.034
40 minutes tops with traffic,

10:12.101 --> 10:13.535
I'm going to kill the bride.

10:17.173 --> 10:18.106
Nice.

10:27.433 --> 10:28.567
Hey, Chuck.

10:28.634 --> 10:29.968
Sorry, can I talk
to you real quick?

10:30.036 --> 10:31.236
I'm just feeling
a little nervous.

10:31.304 --> 10:32.671
Buddy, I'm so sorry,
I can't talk right now.

10:32.739 --> 10:33.705
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:33.773 --> 10:35.340
What's the matter?

10:35.408 --> 10:37.009
You could tell me, I...
I might be able to help.

10:37.076 --> 10:39.711
It's, uh...
It's, uh...

10:39.779 --> 10:42.714
It's the rings.

10:42.782 --> 10:44.649
It's the rings. I have
to go home and get them.

10:44.717 --> 10:46.485
Find Sarah, pull her aside,

10:46.552 --> 10:48.854
and specifically tell her
that I forgot the rings.

10:48.921 --> 10:50.756
The wedding is in 20 minutes.
Ellie is gonna kill you.

10:50.823 --> 10:51.656
Thanks for that.

10:51.724 --> 10:52.824
Unless...

10:52.892 --> 10:54.192
I stall the wedding.

10:54.260 --> 10:55.694
Okay, no one will even
know you're gone.

10:55.762 --> 10:56.995
They'll just blame me.
It'll be fine.

10:57.063 --> 10:58.163
You'd do that for me?

10:58.231 --> 10:59.431
Of course I would, dude.

10:59.499 --> 11:00.799
You've saved my ass
a million times.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.067
It's about time I saved yours.

11:02.135 --> 11:03.402
But go.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.341
<i>Oh!</i>

11:09.409 --> 11:10.809
What is that smell?

11:10.877 --> 11:12.210
There he is!

11:15.081 --> 11:16.415
Ladies.

11:16.482 --> 11:18.550
You ladies get soft without me?

11:18.618 --> 11:20.552
It's been a while. Good to see you, sir.
- Yeah, a long time, Miles...

11:20.620 --> 11:22.054
Come on, Casey.

11:22.121 --> 11:23.488
This is Casey.
Leave a message.

11:23.556 --> 11:24.890
Who's ready to do some hunting?

11:24.957 --> 11:26.558
Hurrah! Hurrah!

11:28.728 --> 11:30.862
Dr. Awesome.
- Don't take another step.

11:30.930 --> 11:32.464
My wife warned me
about you.

11:32.532 --> 11:34.099
Good warnings, I hope.

11:34.167 --> 11:37.169
Retreat two steps back.

11:37.236 --> 11:40.439
I need to get in there.
- You...

11:40.506 --> 11:43.608
Oh, uh, Dr. Woodcomb,
your wife wants me to tell you

11:43.676 --> 11:45.210
to go to the car
and get backup hosiery.

11:45.278 --> 11:46.511
Does that make sense?

11:46.579 --> 11:48.647
Man my post. Don't
let this one in.

11:48.714 --> 11:49.915
Yes, sir.

11:51.117 --> 11:52.784
Sarah, listen to me.

11:52.852 --> 11:54.086
Uh, Chuck forgot the rings,

11:54.153 --> 11:55.987
so he-he went home
to go get them.

11:56.055 --> 11:57.589
He what?

11:57.657 --> 11:58.690
Yeah, the wedding rings.
He blew it.

11:58.758 --> 12:00.392
I have to stall
the wedding.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.761
How do I stall a wedding?

12:02.829 --> 12:05.530
Uh, do it, Morgan, by
any means necessary.

12:05.598 --> 12:07.499
Right, right.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.501
How the hell
do I stall this wedding?

12:09.569 --> 12:10.635
Think, man, think.

12:16.175 --> 12:18.310
It's gone.

12:19.412 --> 12:20.745
Bryce?
- To the new Intersect.

12:20.813 --> 12:22.180
Where? Where? Where is it?!

12:22.248 --> 12:24.416
Chuck, you know I
can't tell you that.

12:24.484 --> 12:25.784
That's top secret.
Not even Beckman...

12:25.852 --> 12:27.719
No, I need it, Bryce. I need it.
My family's in danger.

12:27.787 --> 12:29.988
Ted Roark and his FULCRUM team
are at the wedding.

12:30.056 --> 12:31.456
He's going to kill Ellie
unless I bring him the Cube.

12:33.326 --> 12:34.659
Roark can't have it.
- No.

12:34.727 --> 12:35.961
He'll murder everyone.

12:36.028 --> 12:38.296
No. You're going
to give them me.

12:41.734 --> 12:43.802
They think you're the Intersect.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.504
They've been looking
for me all along.

12:45.571 --> 12:47.339
The Cube can't fall
into the wrong hands.

12:47.406 --> 12:48.807
I made a promise to Orion.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.610
You knew.

12:51.677 --> 12:52.911
That was the deal.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.412
Your dad knew
I protected you at Stanford.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.847
I was the only spy
he would trust.

12:58.885 --> 13:00.785
I can't believe
you've known this whole time.

13:02.088 --> 13:04.589
He wanted to keep you out
of this.

13:04.657 --> 13:07.325
But I knew you could
handle the Intersect,

13:07.393 --> 13:10.228
I knew Sarah
would find you,

13:10.296 --> 13:11.596
and most importantly,
you deserved

13:11.664 --> 13:13.365
to know the truth
about your father.

13:13.432 --> 13:14.466
He's a hero.

13:17.537 --> 13:20.739
Now, let's go get
your sister married.

13:25.244 --> 13:26.344
Yeah, just...

13:26.412 --> 13:28.513
What's the holdup?

13:28.581 --> 13:30.148
Uh, the bride is perfect.

13:30.216 --> 13:31.650
She'll only wilt
from here.

13:31.717 --> 13:33.251
Oh, we can't
find Chuck.

13:33.319 --> 13:34.586
Oh, and the blonde
is gone, too.

13:34.654 --> 13:35.587
Sarah?

13:35.655 --> 13:36.421
Yeah.

13:36.489 --> 13:37.189
Just now?

13:37.256 --> 13:38.023
Yes.

13:38.090 --> 13:39.925
Excuse me.

13:42.595 --> 13:44.529
This is a really weird family.

13:49.235 --> 13:51.336
Don't chew gum.

13:52.538 --> 13:53.905
Sarah?

13:53.973 --> 13:55.840
Something's wrong.

13:57.210 --> 13:59.010
Ted Roark and his
men are inside.

13:59.078 --> 14:00.178
He's alive?

14:00.246 --> 14:01.479
How did...?

14:01.547 --> 14:03.048
Did you bring a gun?

14:03.115 --> 14:04.382
I'll think
of something.

14:04.450 --> 14:06.351
Please, check the chapel
and the bridal chamber.

14:06.419 --> 14:08.320
Make sure there's nobody else.
- Wait.

14:10.590 --> 14:12.557
Use the South East entrance,
through the kitchen.

14:13.759 --> 14:15.493
Okay, thanks.

14:22.702 --> 14:24.269
Hello.

14:24.337 --> 14:25.804
It's on? It's on?

14:25.871 --> 14:27.072
Hello.

14:27.139 --> 14:29.074
Uh, I-I'm Morgan Grimes,

14:29.141 --> 14:31.343
unofficial member
of the wedding party.

14:32.545 --> 14:33.878
Uh, so, uh,

14:33.946 --> 14:35.714
we have
some pre-wedding entertainment

14:35.781 --> 14:36.982
planned for you guys.

14:37.049 --> 14:39.818
So, without
further ado,

14:39.885 --> 14:42.821
I present to you Jeffster!

14:44.657 --> 14:46.825
It's Jeffster!

14:46.892 --> 14:48.193
What's going on?

14:48.261 --> 14:50.128
I don't know,
but this wedding just got good.

14:50.196 --> 14:51.329
Dude, we got
the perfect song.

14:51.397 --> 14:52.497
Knock 'em dead.
Knock 'em dead.

14:52.565 --> 14:54.466
Okay, this is in four/four time.

14:54.533 --> 14:55.600
It's in D.

14:55.668 --> 14:57.602
Watch me for the changes.

15:06.979 --> 15:08.947
Morgan,

15:09.015 --> 15:10.582
you are ruining
my wedding!

15:10.650 --> 15:11.950
Listen to me. If you hit me,

15:12.018 --> 15:13.418
know that it only
teaches me to hit.

15:13.486 --> 15:14.653
Okay, now for reasons
I cannot say,

15:14.720 --> 15:15.820
I have to stall this wedding.

15:15.888 --> 15:16.955
Tell me why.

15:23.129 --> 15:26.431
Because Chuck is in trouble,
and I'm saving him, man.

15:26.499 --> 15:28.199
Chuck told you to do this?

15:28.267 --> 15:30.135
Yes.

15:32.238 --> 15:33.672
Okay, okay, I'm with you.

15:35.474 --> 15:38.009
Okay, no Sarah.

15:38.077 --> 15:39.844
And that is definitely not
the wedding march.

15:39.912 --> 15:42.881
Um, can one of you please go see
what's going on out there?

15:42.948 --> 15:44.249
Now! Thank you. Thank you.

15:46.118 --> 15:47.319
Focus on the calm.

16:01.534 --> 16:04.569
Kevin, why are you letting

16:04.637 --> 16:07.706
Sam Kinison and an Indian
lesbian wreck your wedding?

16:10.743 --> 16:12.477
Dad, just chill out, okay?

16:12.545 --> 16:13.845
Come on.

16:19.985 --> 16:22.253
You know what?

16:22.321 --> 16:24.222
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

16:24.290 --> 16:26.091
Don't you dare!

16:28.194 --> 16:29.627
Chuck.

16:29.695 --> 16:31.963
If you ever want
to see the Intersect again,

16:32.031 --> 16:33.765
you will not
touch anything

16:33.833 --> 16:34.933
in this room.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.368
Do I make myself clear?

16:36.435 --> 16:38.703
Today is my sister's
wedding day,

16:38.771 --> 16:41.139
and believe me, you don't want
to see her angry.

16:42.842 --> 16:44.509
Where's the Intersect, Chuck?

16:44.577 --> 16:46.511
Uh, a-about that...

16:46.579 --> 16:47.479
Kill him.

16:47.546 --> 16:48.880
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

16:48.948 --> 16:50.849
Ho down. Ho down.
I mean, hold on.

16:50.916 --> 16:52.016
Just hold on a second, all right?
- Finally.

16:53.486 --> 16:55.019
I did bring

16:55.087 --> 16:56.721
<i>an</i> Intersect with me.

16:56.789 --> 16:58.623
<i>An</i> Intersect?

16:58.691 --> 16:59.657
Mr. Roark.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.200
Mr. Larkin.

17:09.268 --> 17:12.069
The Human Intersect.

17:17.977 --> 17:19.411
Roark, you want me.

17:19.478 --> 17:21.079
Now let Chuck
and his people go.

17:21.146 --> 17:22.347
We leave,
they stay,

17:22.415 --> 17:23.647
nobody else needs to know.

17:23.715 --> 17:25.349
Terrific plan.

17:25.417 --> 17:27.018
Thing of it is,

17:27.086 --> 17:29.487
FULCRUM wants Chuck here
dead no matter what.

17:29.555 --> 17:30.822
So, with that said,

17:30.890 --> 17:32.290
shoot Mr. Bartowski, or...

17:32.358 --> 17:33.691
Sarah, take him.

17:39.031 --> 17:41.065
Oh, God, not the flowers!

17:54.780 --> 17:56.448
Not the centerpieces.

17:57.783 --> 18:00.618
I'm dry.
Any more knives?

18:00.686 --> 18:02.287
Nope. I threw all eight.

18:03.322 --> 18:04.255
Get up!

18:06.425 --> 18:07.525
Okay.

18:12.364 --> 18:13.531
Oh, God.

18:13.599 --> 18:14.933
Someone just shoot me now.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.001
I can help you with that, Chuck.

18:18.204 --> 18:19.370
Mm.

18:19.438 --> 18:21.172
A real shotgun wedding.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.607
Just think,

18:22.675 --> 18:24.075
that terrible pun

18:24.143 --> 18:26.077
is the last thing
you'll ever hear.

19:00.746 --> 19:01.980
Hello, Ted.

19:06.519 --> 19:08.152
Waited 20 years to do that.

19:21.267 --> 19:22.534
All clear, sir.

19:26.539 --> 19:27.705
You rang.

19:36.982 --> 19:38.082
Chuck.

19:39.318 --> 19:40.485
What happened?

19:40.553 --> 19:42.086
Uh, everything's
all right, Ellie.

19:42.154 --> 19:43.888
There was just a minor
centerpiece problem.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.201
Oh, no.

20:05.744 --> 20:08.279
Wedding canceled.

20:12.986 --> 20:15.054
This is officially a disaster.

20:17.290 --> 20:20.793
I can't believe that my spy life
has wrecked my real life.

20:20.860 --> 20:22.928
Again.

20:22.996 --> 20:25.798
I've completely ruined
my sister's wedding day.

20:25.865 --> 20:27.766
I'm sorry, son. I...

20:29.769 --> 20:32.071
If anyone knows how
you feel, it's me.

20:32.138 --> 20:33.806
You had no
choice, Charles.

20:33.873 --> 20:34.907
You saved
her life.

20:36.543 --> 20:38.677
Hey.

20:38.745 --> 20:41.513
Hey.

20:41.581 --> 20:43.549
You okay?

20:45.719 --> 20:47.786
No, I'm not.

20:47.854 --> 20:50.456
I'm not okay.

20:50.523 --> 20:52.791
I don't want to have
to save my sister

20:52.859 --> 20:55.127
using a Special Forces team.

20:55.195 --> 20:56.829
I just want to be a normal guy

20:56.896 --> 20:59.398
who helps his sister
in normal ways.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.868
Like right now,

21:02.936 --> 21:06.305
if I could give her anything
in the world, I would...

21:11.811 --> 21:13.479
Excuse me.

21:22.789 --> 21:25.891
I think I might know
how to fix this.

21:28.628 --> 21:31.797
You got time for one more
mission before you take off?

21:33.767 --> 21:36.302
It's not
what a normal guy would do.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.213
Don't forget to lock it.

21:48.281 --> 21:50.049
Yeah.

21:53.453 --> 21:55.287
Yeah, Walker, what is it?

21:56.756 --> 21:59.758
You're kidding.

21:59.826 --> 22:01.427
Roger that. We're on it.

22:07.267 --> 22:09.935
Ellie,
are you all right?

22:10.003 --> 22:12.971
Chuck, just please go away.

22:23.850 --> 22:26.785
I can't believe your idiot
friends ruined my wedding.

22:26.853 --> 22:30.789
I'm just-- I'm never going
to forgive Morgan for this.

22:30.857 --> 22:33.726
Well, I think
you're going to have to.

22:36.996 --> 22:39.898
Because Morgan...

22:39.966 --> 22:42.034
and Lester, and Jeff--

22:42.102 --> 22:43.702
they only did
what I asked them to do.

22:45.905 --> 22:48.040
What?

22:50.310 --> 22:51.643
<i>I</i> did all this.

22:51.711 --> 22:53.078
I forgot your rings.

22:53.146 --> 22:55.581
So I told them
to stall.

22:55.648 --> 22:57.583
So if you're going to
be mad at someone,

22:57.650 --> 22:59.385
you should be
mad at me.

23:02.055 --> 23:04.590
Please say something.

23:05.792 --> 23:08.761
You... ruined...

23:08.828 --> 23:10.696
the most important day
of my life.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.298
Look...

23:13.366 --> 23:15.868
Ellie, you have to
trust me, okay.

23:18.505 --> 23:20.005
Take these...

23:22.642 --> 23:25.177
...and I'll take care
of the rest.

23:25.245 --> 23:28.147
Trust me.

23:31.518 --> 23:32.985
Sir, how do you spell begonia?

23:33.052 --> 23:35.087
Sound it out.

23:35.155 --> 23:37.156
No, no, no, that clashes
with the bunting.

23:37.223 --> 23:39.258
Yes, I-I appreciate

23:39.325 --> 23:41.860
that you require extra time
to permit the area,

23:41.928 --> 23:44.329
but this is
a national security matter.

24:23.970 --> 24:26.505
<i>We are gathered here to join together</i>

24:26.573 --> 24:28.373
Eleanor Faye Bartowski

24:28.441 --> 24:31.210
and Devon Christian Woodcomb

24:31.277 --> 24:32.644
in matrimony.

24:32.712 --> 24:34.580
Who gives this woman in marriage
to this man?

24:35.882 --> 24:37.583
We do.
- We do.

24:38.751 --> 24:40.185
I love you.

24:40.253 --> 24:41.620
I love you.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.978
Watch him.

25:10.350 --> 25:11.783
<i>A partnership should not</i>

25:11.851 --> 25:13.785
be entered into lightly,

25:13.853 --> 25:15.754
but with much consideration.

25:15.822 --> 25:19.258
If any person can
show just cause

25:19.325 --> 25:21.793
why they should not be joined,

25:21.861 --> 25:24.162
let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

25:24.230 --> 25:25.531
Sarah.

25:28.134 --> 25:30.235
You're not coming with me,
are you?

25:30.303 --> 25:32.671
Do you have the rings?

26:33.099 --> 26:35.033
Whoo!

27:09.017 --> 27:11.318
Was that... you were

27:11.386 --> 27:13.520
talking about,
secondhand smoke?

27:13.588 --> 27:16.190
Three hundred.

27:21.096 --> 27:22.262
Sir.

27:22.330 --> 27:24.398
Roark wants to talk to you.

27:29.170 --> 27:31.205
Watch my cards.

27:31.272 --> 27:33.140
Watch them.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.346
Better not be about food.

28:24.926 --> 28:26.760
Don't!

28:29.230 --> 28:30.297
Sorry, sir.

28:30.365 --> 28:31.231
We've been
through a lot.

28:31.299 --> 28:33.100
How long you been FULCRUM?

28:33.168 --> 28:34.501
I'm not with FULCRUM.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.738
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

28:37.806 --> 28:39.373
I don't want to look
at your face.

28:39.441 --> 28:42.209
You just killed three Marines
in cold blood.

28:43.545 --> 28:45.446
Yeah.

28:45.513 --> 28:47.514
But none of them saved my life.

29:05.967 --> 29:07.067
Hi.

29:07.135 --> 29:08.368
Thank you.

29:08.436 --> 29:09.670
For what?

29:09.738 --> 29:12.039
For what? For-for
all of this.

29:12.107 --> 29:13.373
For my wedding gift.

29:13.441 --> 29:15.375
This is...

29:15.443 --> 29:16.944
I don't how you did all this.

29:17.011 --> 29:20.748
Well, I can't exactly
take all the credit.

29:20.815 --> 29:23.484
Well, first the beach
and now this.

29:23.551 --> 29:24.985
I don't know.

29:25.053 --> 29:26.186
You're pretty amazing,
little brother.

29:28.056 --> 29:30.524
Sometimes I think
you have super powers.

29:30.592 --> 29:31.992
I wish.

29:32.060 --> 29:32.926
I know.

29:32.994 --> 29:34.695
Chuck,

29:34.763 --> 29:37.297
man, you saved the day.

29:37.365 --> 29:39.633
Looks like you're the big hero.

29:41.402 --> 29:42.803
Thanks, bro.

29:42.871 --> 29:45.105
Well, now I really am your bro.

29:45.173 --> 29:48.008
Yes, you are.

29:59.521 --> 30:01.054
I can't believe you're
actually leaving me.

30:01.122 --> 30:02.189
All right, don't, Chuck.

30:02.257 --> 30:03.824
I'll cry.
We don't want that

30:03.892 --> 30:05.425
now, do we?

30:05.493 --> 30:06.960
I'm happy for
you, buddy.

30:07.028 --> 30:08.328
I think that
you are going

30:08.396 --> 30:10.697
to be the greatest Hibachi
chef in the world.

30:10.765 --> 30:11.999
I don't know, man. This whole...

30:12.066 --> 30:13.467
"making your dreams
come true thing" is hard.

30:13.535 --> 30:16.170
And the bigger the dream,
the harder it gets.

30:16.237 --> 30:19.306
You know, on one side, you know,
the girl you love.

30:19.374 --> 30:21.308
And then on the other,
life as you know it.

30:21.376 --> 30:23.644
It's just, you know,
friends and family,

30:23.711 --> 30:25.379
and job
you can't stand.

30:25.446 --> 30:26.446
I don't know, man.

30:26.514 --> 30:27.681
I should just go
with Anna, right?

30:27.749 --> 30:30.017
But then I, uh...
I'm overthinking this,

30:30.084 --> 30:31.485
aren't I?
- Yeah, yeah, you are.

30:31.553 --> 30:33.620
Go with your
heart, buddy.

30:33.688 --> 30:36.156
Our brains only screw things up.

30:49.971 --> 30:51.638
Where's Bryce?

30:51.706 --> 30:53.407
Gone.

30:53.474 --> 30:55.209
They're uploading him with
the new computer tonight.

30:56.344 --> 30:58.212
Off to save the world.

30:59.414 --> 31:02.316
I guess
both of you are.

31:02.383 --> 31:04.218
You want to dance?

31:06.321 --> 31:08.188
You know I do.

31:36.351 --> 31:38.218
Mr. Bartowski.

31:40.822 --> 31:42.656
Or is this an Orion
conversation?

31:42.724 --> 31:45.759
A bit of both.

31:45.827 --> 31:49.630
I reconfigured the Cube for you
under two conditions:

31:49.697 --> 31:52.799
You stop looking for me,
and you leave my son alone.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.701
We asked Chuck to be on my team.
He said no.

31:57.372 --> 31:59.273
Good-bye, Orion.

31:59.340 --> 32:01.208
You made changes--

32:01.276 --> 32:02.342
to the Intersect.

32:02.410 --> 32:04.478
To my initial designs.

32:04.545 --> 32:06.113
The data architecture
is different.

32:06.180 --> 32:08.382
What does this new computer do?

32:08.449 --> 32:10.517
You don't want to know.

32:10.585 --> 32:11.718
Agent Larkin.

32:11.786 --> 32:12.619
It's time to go.

32:31.372 --> 32:34.241
You belong out there,
saving the world.

32:35.710 --> 32:37.477
I'm just...

32:37.545 --> 32:39.012
I'm just not that guy.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.281
How many times do you
have to be a hero

32:41.349 --> 32:43.951
to realize that
you are that guy?

32:47.255 --> 32:49.256
But I want more, Sarah.

32:50.391 --> 32:51.858
I want a life.

32:52.994 --> 32:55.028
I want a real life.

32:58.266 --> 33:00.267
Chuck, I don't want
to save the world.

33:04.572 --> 33:06.173
I want...
- Chuck, the agent...

33:06.240 --> 33:07.941
the agent who
came for Bryce...

33:08.009 --> 33:10.677
he isn't a CIA agent.

33:10.745 --> 33:12.279
He's supposed to be dead.

33:13.648 --> 33:15.382
Dad, how could you
possibly know that?

33:18.219 --> 33:19.486
Screw it.

33:19.554 --> 33:21.688
I... I have an Intersect
in my head.

33:21.756 --> 33:23.623
I... I tested the
computer on myself.

33:23.691 --> 33:25.625
I was young
and stupid,

33:25.693 --> 33:27.427
but the intel was good.

33:27.495 --> 33:28.895
That man isn't CIA.

33:28.963 --> 33:31.064
Bryce.

33:31.132 --> 33:32.432
Bryce is getting
the upload tonight.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.867
They're going to kill him.

33:33.935 --> 33:35.836
They'll download the Intersect
into their team instead.

33:35.903 --> 33:38.005
Well, if they know about Bryce,
they know about Casey.

33:42.243 --> 33:43.176
Sarah...
- Let her go, son.

33:43.244 --> 33:44.177
You've done your part.

33:44.245 --> 33:45.212
No, I have to go.

33:45.279 --> 33:46.980
No... no, you don't.

33:47.048 --> 33:48.148
You're not a spy.

33:48.216 --> 33:50.350
Dad...

33:51.552 --> 33:52.552
I love her.

34:01.863 --> 34:03.864
I can't follow
you, son,

34:03.931 --> 34:06.066
but take this.

34:10.605 --> 34:12.239
Thank you.

34:15.309 --> 34:16.943
Be safe, Charles.
- Thank you.

34:20.447 --> 34:21.614
Hey, I'm coming
with you.

34:21.681 --> 34:22.882
Stay here-- it's
not your mission.

34:22.949 --> 34:24.951
Wait... this is the Interect

34:25.018 --> 34:26.485
we're talking about,
and I'm a Bartowski.

34:26.554 --> 34:28.255
You need me.

34:30.158 --> 34:31.725
Let's go.

34:42.492 --> 34:43.659
Did you see her?

34:43.726 --> 34:46.161
Agent Walker?

34:46.228 --> 34:48.096
She was amazing,
right?

34:48.164 --> 34:50.699
Yes, sir.

34:50.766 --> 34:52.768
She loves another guy.

34:52.835 --> 34:54.168
Bad day to be me.

34:54.237 --> 34:55.536
You have no idea.

34:58.007 --> 34:59.741
Mr. Larkin.

35:14.223 --> 35:15.757
Open this door!

35:20.797 --> 35:22.397
They're already here.

35:41.517 --> 35:42.951
Bryce must be in the vault!

35:43.019 --> 35:44.386
Chuck, go get help.

35:58.735 --> 35:59.801
Help!

36:04.841 --> 36:06.575
Hello, Chuck.

36:06.643 --> 36:08.777
Bryce.

36:08.845 --> 36:11.413
Bryce, Casey and Sarah
are pinned down outside.

36:11.481 --> 36:13.115
I'm on it.

36:18.454 --> 36:20.822
Oh, my God... oh, my God.

36:20.890 --> 36:23.158
Oh, my God,
you've been shot.

36:23.226 --> 36:24.292
Yeah.

36:27.630 --> 36:29.665
I'm really sorry
about this, Chuck.

36:29.732 --> 36:31.199
No.

36:31.267 --> 36:33.001
No, it's okay...
it's okay.

36:33.069 --> 36:35.303
You're going to be fine--
it's not that bad.

36:35.371 --> 36:36.438
Take care of her.

36:36.506 --> 36:37.773
Don't... don't say that.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.907
You're not dying.

36:38.975 --> 36:40.842
She needs you,
man, okay?

36:40.910 --> 36:42.978
You... you guys are going
to go on missions together

36:43.046 --> 36:44.713
and do exciting things
and save the world.

36:44.781 --> 36:46.615
You'll be a team again--
it will be great.

36:47.817 --> 36:49.284
She wasn't going to come.

36:52.288 --> 36:53.188
She wants...
- Come on.

36:53.256 --> 36:55.123
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

37:00.396 --> 37:02.164
This will destroy the Intersect.

37:02.231 --> 37:03.799
This new computer
is too powerful.

37:03.866 --> 37:05.534
It's too dangerous.

37:07.970 --> 37:09.671
But you need...

37:09.739 --> 37:11.707
you need the computer
to fight FULCRUM.

37:11.774 --> 37:13.642
FULCRUM doesn't matter,
all right?

37:13.710 --> 37:15.811
They... they're just...

37:15.878 --> 37:17.579
they're just one part
of the Ring.

37:17.647 --> 37:20.082
They'll use it
against us, Chuck.

37:20.149 --> 37:21.717
You have
to do this.

37:21.784 --> 37:22.984
All right?

37:23.052 --> 37:24.553
You have to destroy
that computer,

37:24.620 --> 37:25.687
and then get out of here.

37:26.889 --> 37:28.990
Yeah, but you can beat them.

37:31.227 --> 37:33.995
You're a real...

37:34.063 --> 37:35.697
hero, Bryce.

37:38.367 --> 37:39.935
Bryce.

37:42.905 --> 37:44.873
Oh, my God.

38:07.864 --> 38:10.465
I can't figure out why Bryce
did this, why he chose me.

38:12.735 --> 38:14.736
You can do anything--
I've seen you in action.

38:16.405 --> 38:17.806
You can't put him out
in the field.

38:17.874 --> 38:19.040
<i>He won't survive.</i>

38:19.108 --> 38:20.942
It's time for you
to become a spy.

38:21.010 --> 38:23.278
I'm just Chuck Bartowski,
not a hero.

38:23.346 --> 38:25.347
How many times do you
have to be a hero

38:25.414 --> 38:27.649
<i>to realize</i>
<i>that you are that guy?</i>

39:36.118 --> 39:37.185
What did you do?

39:41.891 --> 39:43.491
What did you do?!

39:44.660 --> 39:46.328
I destroyed it.

39:46.395 --> 39:48.396
You're too late.

39:48.464 --> 39:51.132
For that, you'll die last.

39:53.302 --> 39:54.469
Bryce.

39:55.671 --> 39:57.038
Bryce!

39:58.541 --> 39:59.541
Bryce, no... help me.

39:59.609 --> 40:01.676
No, don't you touch him!

40:11.487 --> 40:12.587
There's nothing left.

40:13.789 --> 40:15.090
So, you lose.

40:23.099 --> 40:24.599
You should
know this.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.134
No one stops us.

40:28.271 --> 40:29.271
No one ever has.

40:29.338 --> 40:30.772
Who are you?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.275
Spies, Agent Walker.

40:33.342 --> 40:34.276
The best.

40:42.485 --> 40:43.919
Sir, you should look at this.

40:45.821 --> 40:47.122
Chuck, did you just flash?

40:50.226 --> 40:51.726
He uploaded it.

40:51.794 --> 40:53.762
Oh, Chuck me.

40:55.298 --> 40:56.698
Kill him.

41:56.959 --> 41:57.859
Chuck?

41:59.028 --> 42:00.829
Guys...

42:02.765 --> 42:04.032
I know kung fu.

42:04.033 --> 42:05.034
