Not baseball. Girls.

require a microphone?

Well, you know how Joe
likes his pizza Chicago-style.

02:21.208 --> 02:24.417
Well, he took the jet last night
to Chicago and got himself some pizza.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.208
Oh, yeah, and he got in pretty late,
so he's sleeping in.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.166
And he wanted us to record
the breakfast meeting.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.333

the sizzling of the bacon.

is a little weird.

It's, like, there's no swirl.

only goes choppa-choppa-choppa,

Did you get a chance to put the diamonds
on the soles of my shoes yet?

03:42.709 --> 03:46.375
OK, Stella, you are more than welcome
to stay for breakfast, sweetheart,

03:46.458 --> 03:48.583
but this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

03:48.667 --> 03:51.166
We promised each other
that if this band blew up,

03:51.250 --> 03:53.834
we would stay grounded
and just like a regular family.

03:53.917 --> 03:57.625

Come on, relax.

03:57.709 --> 03:59.542

this band becomes,

03:59.625 --> 04:01.792
we will always retain that common touch.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.333
Thank you, Pasquale.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.709
OK, when was the last time
anyone did a chore around here?

04:06.792 --> 04:09.417

-The 30th.
-Yeah.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.625
OK, Mom, the last family dinner
was three weeks ago tomorrow.

04:16.709 --> 04:18.250
Oh, and by the way, thank you so much

04:18.333 --> 04:19.625

with your schedule, Mom.

gonna start acting like one again.

That means no more breakfast meetings,

Plus, we're never gonna
make it home for Mom's dinner.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.583
Our family's gonna be destroyed
and our lives are over.

No problem. Let's just call your parents
and tell them what's going on.

No, Mom already thinks it's impossible
for us to be a normal family.

-Then we should call the police.

we have to run an errand for our mom.

"Let's take out the garbage."

And, Nick, you were like, "Look at us.
We're taking out the garbage."

And I was like, "Hey, I'm Joe,
and I'm taking out the garbage, yes!"

What's your point?

14:38.667 --> 14:42.166
Why is it that every inspiring speech
has to have a point?

It's OK.
It's still me, Joe.

-I mean, we're surrounded by costumes.

I'll go as Joe.
