00:04.395 --> 00:05.614
HANA: Looks like they're here.

00:05.657 --> 00:06.963
MAN: Commander, we're
seeing incoming debris.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.883
MAN: No comment on
the new neighbors?

00:13.926 --> 00:15.406
HANA: Let's just say they
made quite an entrance.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.973
KURT: Commander Hurrelle,
but you can call me Kurt.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.322
HANA: Commander Hana Seung.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.932
MARTA: They're not
scientists, they're miners.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.196
Here to steal
natural resources
and to make a profit.

00:22.239 --> 00:26.069
JOON: What Lukrum industries
wants is to back-door IMSF
into some sort of partnership.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.723
HANA: I wish you were
still secretary general.

00:27.766 --> 00:31.074
ROLAND: The IMSF is becoming
irrelevant, on your watch.

00:31.118 --> 00:34.077
AMELIE: Javier,
I'm going home.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.600
I'm sorry.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.776
LESLIE: IMSF has struck a
deal with Lukrum Industries.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.256
Give the miners
what they want.

No yawning on the job.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.095
SHEP: Sorry, boss.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.618
Just be a lot easier to
do this during the day.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.315
KURT: Then we wouldn't be
doing it at night, would we?

01:38.359 --> 01:40.100
JEN: We're getting
low on fuel.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.537
We're burning through
a lot of it with all
these double shifts.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.582
KURT: No complaining either.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.454
JEN: I just don't
understand why we have to be
so secretive about all this.

01:46.497 --> 01:47.803
We're not even in their area.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.065
KURT: Hey Shep, stop here.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.936
SHEP: Yup, got it.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.808
KURT: Sensor nodes online.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.157
JEN: Solid contact.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.942
KURT: Go.
JEN: Initiate seismic wave.

02:03.558 --> 02:06.909
SHEP: Keep driving? Sir?

02:06.952 --> 02:08.302
JEN: Do you see something?

02:12.219 --> 02:13.524
KURT: Only what
we're looking for.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.398
AMELIE: I wish Earth
were more visible.

02:18.399 --> 02:21.271
It might have been
easier not feeling so
far away from everything.

02:22.707 --> 02:25.188
HANA: You're going
to miss this view.

02:25.232 --> 02:28.017
AMELIE: Honestly?

02:28.060 --> 02:33.979
No. No. No.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.157
The only thing I'll
miss is all of you.

02:38.245 --> 02:41.204
HANA: Well, it won't be
the same without you here.

02:41.248 --> 02:44.033
AMELIE: You'll have your
sister to keep you company.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.905
And the others,
and all the new people, too.

02:49.952 --> 02:53.869
HANA: While I remain uneasy
with some of their views,
the Lukrum colonists are our

02:53.912 --> 02:55.697
neighbors here.

02:55.740 --> 03:00.397
And in a lonely
place like this, more
unites us than divides us.

03:02.573 --> 03:06.838
Since they've arrived here,
real connections have been
made between our colonies.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.579
JEN: Thank you, cheers.
CAMERON: Cheers.

03:08.623 --> 03:10.799
HANA: Friendships
have been forged.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.715
KURT: I mean, this'll be
the first of many, and it's
going to go with Gale Crater.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.544
ROBERT: It'll be more
energy-efficient with
smaller connector domes.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.241
KURT: Yes, it would.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.156
HANA: Boundaries
have been drawn.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.767
WOMAN: Hey Marta, miners
are surveying in Sector 10.

03:25.814 --> 03:26.858
MARTA: As long as
they're nowhere near us.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.296
HANA: And they've
been respected.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.732
They have to be.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.386
How's the view from up there?

03:32.429 --> 03:35.258
Because we're millions of
miles from anyone else.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.564
And where are we now?

03:36.607 --> 03:37.782
And all we have.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.131
WOMAN [over computer]:
7% completion.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.959
HANA: Is each other.
Getting there.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.918
[speaking in Mandarin].

03:42.961 --> 03:44.398
CHEN: [speaking in Mandarin].

03:44.441 --> 03:45.877
Your Mandarin's
getting better.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.793
HANA: My Mandarin's a little
better than your Korean.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.055
Speak later.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.581
GLENN: Final checks and
reviews initiated on Saga 3,

03:53.624 --> 03:55.452
on track for its
scheduled departure.

03:55.496 --> 03:56.888
HANA: And Saga 4?

03:56.932 --> 03:58.977
GLENN: Landing port's been
cleared for its arrival.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.066
HANA: Great.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.416
GLENN: Any tips on how to
tell you and your sister
apart when she gets here?

04:02.459 --> 04:03.417
HANA: Yeah.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.505
She's tougher.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.943
Anything else?

04:07.986 --> 04:10.989
GLENN: I'm not sure how
you're going to feel about it,
but Lukrum colony's using more

04:11.033 --> 04:12.469
water than expected.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.688
HANA: What percentage?

04:13.731 --> 04:15.777
GLENN: Ten over the
agreed-upon amount.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.866
Which wouldn't be so bad
if they were living up to
their end of the bargain.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.998
They haven't made a single
solar mirror for us yet.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.174
HANA: I know.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.307
And with how much they're
putting into building the
pipeline, I haven't pushed.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.657
I'll advise IMSF.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.487
LESLIE: We have a temporary
agreement with Lukrum.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.794
It's not as though it gives
them the keys to the kingdom.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.013
-But this opens the door.

04:35.057 --> 04:38.452
If they're already refusing to
accept the Outer Space Treaty.

04:38.495 --> 04:41.498
MAN: Which is quite
vague, as we all know.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.674
WOMAN: How can any
agreement be enforced?

04:43.718 --> 04:45.894
It's not as though we can
send an army over there.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.635
LESLIE: Or should.

04:47.678 --> 04:50.159
WOMAN: Some form of
territorial law has
to be put in place.

04:50.202 --> 04:53.641
MAN: Might I suggest
that we are being
overly cautious here.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.470
No one owns the planet, just
as no one owns the ocean.

04:56.513 --> 05:00.343
But its resources can
be farmed the same way
international waters are

05:00.387 --> 05:01.475
farmed here.

05:01.518 --> 05:04.086
It's a system that
already works.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.653
WOMAN: Because it
can be policed.

05:05.696 --> 05:09.047
Mars is seven months away,
and without a governing body.

05:09.091 --> 05:12.181
[indistinct chatter]

05:12.224 --> 05:16.707
LESLIE: May I remind the
board that Lukrum is committed
to fast-tracking IMSF's

05:16.751 --> 05:18.883
terraforming efforts.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.843
And this is at a time
when seeing results, however
small, matters not only to the

05:21.886 --> 05:26.195
public, but to our
solvency as a space agency.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.676
So for now, we must give them
the benefit of the doubt.

05:28.719 --> 05:32.375
WOMAN: It is important to
remember that under Secretary
General Seung's guidance,

05:32.419 --> 05:37.511
IMSF became the most
respected space exploration
agency in the world.

05:37.554 --> 05:43.517
And she felt quite strongly
that companies like Lukrum
had no place at our table.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.389
MAN: Oh really? And where
would we be without Lukrum now?

05:46.433 --> 05:47.738
Who would finance it?

05:47.782 --> 05:53.831
[indistinct chatter].

05:56.443 --> 05:59.663
ELON: I'm sure in the
future there will be lots
of debate about Mars.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.273
You know, what
will the rules be?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.798
How might they be different
from the rules here on Earth?

06:05.974 --> 06:08.585
-Even our
existing legislation
around Mars leaves

06:08.629 --> 06:11.806
a lot of areas open
to interpretation.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.286
Back in 1967, the
entire world agreed on

06:14.330 --> 06:16.288
this outer space treaty,

06:16.332 --> 06:20.815
that essentially states that
no one can own another planet.

06:20.858 --> 06:24.427
MICHIO: But the problem is, it
says nothing about restricting
private enterprise.

06:24.471 --> 06:31.129
Because the whole idea
that a private company could
claim huge chunks of Mars was

06:31.173 --> 06:33.088
considered preposterous.

06:33.131 --> 06:36.134
Now we think, yes,
it's inevitable.

06:36.178 --> 06:39.442
NEWT: I'm sure that
there are people who'd like
to run it as a preserve.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.271
And guarantee that
nothing positive happens.

06:42.314 --> 06:45.448
But the truth is,
there's a huge amount
of resources in space,

06:45.492 --> 06:48.930
and you can almost certainly
mine it at a profitable level.

06:48.973 --> 06:52.673
ANN: But if their
motive is to exploit

06:52.716 --> 06:56.111
the resources on Mars,
then it would be a

06:56.154 --> 07:01.464
profit-driven enterprise,
and we have a profit-driven
planet already.

07:01.508 --> 07:06.817
And we've got some very
big problems that can't
be solved by that system.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.953
LUCIANNE: A lot of the
debates that we're having
over how we'll live on Mars,

07:11.996 --> 07:16.871
are really mirrored by
the kinds of debates we're
having here on Earth.

07:16.914 --> 07:19.787
REPORTER [over TV]: Breaking
news tonight in the battle to
try to stop a controversial

07:19.830 --> 07:21.397
crude oil pipeline.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.964
REPORTER [over TV]:
Drill, drill, drill.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.227
We need the oil.
Why are we even
discussing this?

07:25.270 --> 07:28.752
LUCIANNE: So when we talk
about what we're thinking
about doing on Mars,

07:28.796 --> 07:32.887
what we're really doing
is talking about what we
think is okay to do here

07:32.930 --> 07:34.236
on this planet.

07:38.022 --> 07:41.504
MIKE: We're currently
one mile off the rig.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.941
We're in a good position
to start launching boats.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.511
SINI: We are here
protesting this particular
company drilling here,

07:48.555 --> 07:52.428
but also in general protesting
against Arctic oil drilling.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.563
It's insane to come here
and drill for more oil,
when we have climate change

07:56.606 --> 07:58.390
pushing on us.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.176
ANTONIA: Our experience
on Earth has shown that
companies want access

08:01.219 --> 08:03.265
to new territory everywhere.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.920
And so the Arctic is a
perfect example of this.

08:05.963 --> 08:11.665
We see companies
looking at the Arctic as
essentially a porthole for oil.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.885
At the same time,
we have a counter-movement,

08:14.929 --> 08:17.801
that says we are not going
down without a fight.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.934
MAN [over radio]:
Arctic Sunrise, request
that you keep well clear

08:19.977 --> 08:23.677
of 500-meter safety zone.

08:23.720 --> 08:28.551
-What we're going to
do is go to the site
of the Tsonga Enabler,

08:28.595 --> 08:31.032
and stay there.

08:31.075 --> 08:35.558
By staying there, they have
to stop their operations.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.692
Where are our friends,
the Coast Guard vessel?

08:38.735 --> 08:42.304
-From the industry's
standpoint, they want
to develop this area.

08:42.347 --> 08:46.961
So they are not happy about
these protests, as Greenpeace
certainly found out in Russia.

08:51.269 --> 08:55.230
SINI: It's something that you
have to decide upon when you
decide to participate in these

08:55.273 --> 08:58.581
actions, that you are
ready to take the risk.

08:58.625 --> 09:03.064
I did know that doing actions
in, in Russia is more risky

09:03.107 --> 09:05.109
than doing actions
somewhere else.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.721
But there is always
this unknown factor.

09:09.853 --> 09:13.422
There was me and then another
climber, and they were
spraying like ice-cold water

09:13.465 --> 09:15.772
on us with the big fire hoses.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.469
Already, that was
really dangerous.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.602
And then everything else
that happened on top of it.

09:19.646 --> 09:23.127
[gunshots].

09:23.171 --> 09:25.565
MAN [over radio]:
Guns pointed in our faces.

09:25.608 --> 09:29.090
Two guns pointed
directly at our faces.

09:29.133 --> 09:32.093
NARRATOR: Special forces
landed on their ship.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.486
It was a strong
first response.

09:34.530 --> 09:40.754
30 Greenpeace activists
are sitting in jail on
controversial piracy charges.

09:41.015 --> 09:45.497
SINI: We might have
been in prison for seven
years, or for two years,

09:45.541 --> 09:48.370
or something in between.

09:48.413 --> 09:52.853
So the uncertainty, that
was the scariest thing.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.814
[phone ringing].

10:07.171 --> 10:09.304
SINI: Even though
it's horrible what
happened in Russia,

10:09.347 --> 10:15.092
what it caused to my family
and, and my friends, I still
think it's a necessity.

10:15.136 --> 10:19.706
You have to be able
to leave and not be certain
when you'll come back home.

10:29.411 --> 10:35.504
SINI: I can't live a life
where I'm not doing all that
I can to protect planet Earth.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.984
It's what my home is.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.599
ANN: We are made for this
world, made for Earth.

10:43.643 --> 10:48.343
Just as all the other
living things on it are.

10:48.386 --> 10:54.001
When I imagine the first
people to live on Mars, what
will their relationship be to

10:54.044 --> 10:56.133
their mother planet?

10:56.177 --> 11:01.356
Will they long for this
world, or will they feel as
if they have another home?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.440
AMELIE: Hey.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.399
JAVIER: What can I do for you?

11:44.442 --> 11:47.271
AMELIE: It would mean a lot
if you came to the party.

11:47.315 --> 11:51.058
It's not just for me,
it's for everyone else
who is leaving, too.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.321
JAVIER: I won't be
able to make it.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.759
AMELIE: Alright.

11:56.803 --> 12:02.547
Will you at least keep
this lavender, since
you grew it for me?

12:10.207 --> 12:14.385
JAVIER: Smell is
one of the strongest
senses tied to memory...

12:21.131 --> 12:23.525
and I need to forget you.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.846

VOICE [over computer]:
Begin transmission.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.427
HANA: Hey, Leslie.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.473
I just wanted to reach out to
you personally to share some
concerns I have about Lukrum

12:58.516 --> 13:00.040
colony.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.520
They're pulling about 10% more
water than they should be.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.348
In the next week,
it could be 20.

13:04.392 --> 13:08.048
Not to pile on, but they
haven't completed any
solar mirrors, either.

13:08.091 --> 13:12.095
I could really use some
support from IMSF on this.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.531
I look forward to
hearing from you.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.142
Hope you're well.

13:15.185 --> 13:20.843
VOICE [over computer]:
Transmission ended. Recording.

13:20.887 --> 13:25.674
LESLIE: Commander.
Whatever's going on
there is short-term.

13:25.717 --> 13:30.897
And for you to take the Lukrum
colony to task over something
as essential as needing a bit

13:30.940 --> 13:36.903
more water, seems
petty at best, and
short-sighted at worst.

13:36.946 --> 13:42.909
And one more thing,
I recognize you probably

13:42.952 --> 13:47.217
often speak to Joon about
minor details such as this one.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.873
But I'm not your sister.

13:50.917 --> 13:54.703
You do your job,
and I'll do mine.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.446
VOICE [over computer]:
Transmission ended.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.534
HANA: What the hell?

14:05.453 --> 14:09.892
KIM: For most of our
evolutionary history, nature
was so much bigger than us.

14:09.936 --> 14:13.853
We were a small impact on the
planet, no matter what we did.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.333
And we didn't have
the technological
capacity to do more.

14:19.771 --> 14:23.863
But we have been
improving our technologies
at a pretty rapid clip,

14:23.906 --> 14:26.039
generation to generation.

14:26.082 --> 14:32.045
And we have been seeing
the natural world as a
free source of income.

14:32.088 --> 14:36.353
Within the last couple of
generations, we've got the
number of people and the

14:36.397 --> 14:41.097
technological powers to wreck
the Earth in a way that we
never had the power to before.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.927
REPORTER [over TV]: An oil
well ripped open when a
drilling rig blew up.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.625
REPORTER [over TV]: Is that
oil in danger now of
escaping into the sea?

14:47.669 --> 14:49.801
REPORTER [over TV]:
Uh, that is correct.

14:49.845 --> 14:54.023
ANTONIA: One of the things that
pushed the Deepwater Horizon
disaster was pushing time,

14:54.067 --> 14:56.069
pushing profit.

14:56.112 --> 14:59.463
It led to mistake after
mistake after mistake,
which led to the completely

14:59.507 --> 15:03.772
predictable outcome of
the worst offshore drilling
oil spill in world history.

15:03.815 --> 15:08.429
REPORTER [over TV]: That oil
has formed a slick up to 100
miles long, and 30 miles wide.

15:08.472 --> 15:12.476
ANTONIA: It's very typical in
these projects that workers
will be pushed faster than

15:12.520 --> 15:16.611
they should be pushed,
technology will be pushed
faster than it should be pushed.

15:16.654 --> 15:22.660
Massive error is almost always
the result, and those errors
have disastrous consequences.

15:25.794 --> 15:31.974
-Tsonga Enabler,
Arctic Sunrise uh, is here to
protest peacefully against the

15:32.018 --> 15:34.368
preparations for
reckless drilling.

15:34.411 --> 15:38.328
What you are doing is
an historic mistake.

15:38.372 --> 15:43.116
-It's going to be a huge
environmental disaster if
an oil spill happens here.

15:43.159 --> 15:48.295
I mean, the problem with
this particular area
is that it's so remote.

15:48.338 --> 15:51.602
I don't think there is any
means to really clean it up.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.823
-With large-scale drilling
operations, time is money.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.521
And that is probably not
going to change on Mars.

15:57.565 --> 16:01.003
It's the next frontier,
the next logical
step for industry.

16:01.047 --> 16:04.224
So I can certainly see the
same debate playing out,
no matter where we go.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.010
ROBERT: Pretty
impressive build, when
you think about it.

16:08.054 --> 16:11.144
JAVIER: Yeah, fast one too,
almost cost you an arm.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.493
ROBERT: That was an accident.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.538
Have you seen their
expansion plans?

16:14.582 --> 16:19.195
In four years, Lukrum will
overtake Olympus Town in
purpose and population.

16:19.239 --> 16:22.720
JAVIER: I don't want to
think about four days from
now, much less four years.

16:22.764 --> 16:26.594
ROBERT: And it all could
have been avoided if you
just asked Amelie to stay.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.161
JAVIER: There was no point.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.032
She had already
made up her mind.

16:30.076 --> 16:34.036
And anyway, personal feelings
take a back seat to duty.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.604
Isn't that what you tell
yourself about Hana?

16:36.647 --> 16:37.997
ROBERT: Big mouth.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.650
JAVIER: I have eyes.
ROBERT: Yeah, I bet you do.

16:39.694 --> 16:43.219
KURT: Fellas.
Kurt Hurrelle here. Got
some questions for you.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.527
MARTA: Is this from sector 8?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.746
CAMERON: Yeah.
MARTA: Anything?

16:48.790 --> 16:53.099
CAMERON: No, it's all inert,
other than the microbial
form we already know.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.752
MARTA: Magnify it.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.276
CAMERON: It's not
going to matter.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.973
MARTA: I just want to
take a closer look. Magnify.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.413
CAMERON: Yeah,
there's no difference.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.893
MARTA: Go to 800.
CAMERON: Marta.

17:04.936 --> 17:05.937
MARTA: Just do
what I tell you.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.727
I just have to show progress.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.555
And we can only do so
much from the surface.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.731
CAMERON: I know.

17:16.774 --> 17:19.560
MARTA: Maybe they should
have spent more on drills
and ground-penetrating radar,

17:19.603 --> 17:21.997
than on a new lab.

17:22.041 --> 17:26.871
Maybe those bastards at
Lukrum have the right idea.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.222
KURT: Commander.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.875
To what do I owe the honor?

17:30.919 --> 17:33.095
HANA: I need to bring some
issues to your attention.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.836
First being water usage.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.143
You're taking 10%
more from our supply
than we had agreed on.

17:37.186 --> 17:40.624
KURT: Well, maybe we can make
up for that by unplugging now.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.452
We found an ice shelf nearby,
so we'll no longer need to

17:42.496 --> 17:45.934
draw any supplemental
water or power.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.415
Actually I was just
hashing out the details
with your guys here.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.331
Right, guys?

17:52.462 --> 17:55.770
We want to deactivate
the pipeline, but leave it
available for emergencies.

17:55.813 --> 17:56.771
HANA: That's fine.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.338
That's not the only issue.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.601
I understand you need time to
fully outfit your mission,

18:00.644 --> 18:02.255
but you also have
a commitment to ours.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.821
KURT: Solar mirrors.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.606
That's the other thing I was
talking to your guys about.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.999
We will get our first one
over to you as soon as we can.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.089
HANA: Thank you.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.791
ROBERT: Comms,
Commander Seung.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.749
HANA: Commander Seung.

18:18.793 --> 18:22.318
ROBERT: Hey listen,
sorry, just assumed you
had already been notified.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.363
HANA: It's okay.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.668
ROBERT: Hana, really.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.757
They just called
us in. We had no idea.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.063
HANA: I said it's okay.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.369
VOICE [over computer]:
End communication.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.460
ROBERT: I think
we're in trouble.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.418
JAVIER: I think you are.

18:42.382 --> 18:46.647
HANA: Unbelievable.
I have never met anyone
more condescending,

18:46.690 --> 18:49.040
disrespectful, more sexist.

18:49.084 --> 18:52.348
JOON: It's been a struggle for
me too, being taken seriously.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.742
You know, it's still hard
being a woman in charge.

18:54.785 --> 18:59.181
But I must admit, I'm a little
surprised that Leslie got into
bed with Lukrum like this.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.836
HANA: I don't think she
likes me very much anymore.

19:01.879 --> 19:04.839
JOON: She probably
doesn't like her job very much.

19:04.882 --> 19:09.670
It's hard, maintaining
all the funding, managing
public perception. It's.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.024
HANA: Are you okay?

19:16.067 --> 19:17.417
[speaking in Korean].

19:17.460 --> 19:19.419
JOON: Yeah, I'm just tired.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.682
Mostly of being weightless.

19:21.725 --> 19:27.340
Anyway, as far as Leslie's
concerned, you have to just
give her time to find her way.

19:27.383 --> 19:30.343
Everybody deserves that.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.779
HANA: Yeah.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.349
ANIKA: Secretary General,
you asked to see me?

19:36.392 --> 19:38.089
LESLIE: Yes, thank
you for coming, Anika.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.830
Take a seat.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.228
Do you see where I am?

19:46.272 --> 19:47.708
Where I sit at this table?

19:47.751 --> 19:49.753
ANIKA: Of course.

19:49.797 --> 19:53.540
LESLIE: It is my
responsibility to keep this
organization at the forefront

19:53.583 --> 19:56.238
of space exploration.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.327
I need help in achieving that.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.720
ANIKA: You have
our full support.

19:59.763 --> 20:02.157
LESLIE: And I need respect.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.508
Part of the reason why I
was approached to take this
position was because unlike

20:05.552 --> 20:09.382
anyone at this table,
I have been to Mars.

20:09.425 --> 20:12.733
Not even Joon Seung
could say that.

20:12.776 --> 20:17.477
So rather than invoking
the spirit of my predecessor,
I need you as my colleague

20:17.520 --> 20:23.265
and as my friend, to look
forward, and not back.

20:38.889 --> 20:43.720
AMELIE: You know what's funny,
I'm in a better shape now
than I was before I got here.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.332
WOMAN: Aerobically,
maybe, but your muscles.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.116
AMELIE: I know.

20:48.159 --> 20:51.946
But every little bit
will help me readjust
to Earth's gravity.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.383
Mae, end simulation.

20:55.993 --> 20:59.780
Now I just need to check
my labs and approve myself
for the return flight.

20:59.823 --> 21:03.436
Mae, lab results on Amelie
Durand, start with blood work.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.786
MAE: Durand, Amelie, female.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.658
Chem panel normal,
lipid panel, normal.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.660
CBC normal.

21:10.704 --> 21:14.185
Hormone panel, HCG detected
outside normal range.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.839
AMELIE: Wait, no.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.624
That has to be a mistake.

21:17.667 --> 21:22.150
Uh, Mae, detail
hormone panel results.

21:22.193 --> 21:26.285
MAE: HCG detected
at IUL 426.

21:26.328 --> 21:30.637
Patient appears
to be approximately
four weeks pregnant.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.855
AMELIE: No.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.657
JOHAR: Hey Joon,
a few of us are going
to eat in the galley.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.050
You want to join us?

21:53.094 --> 21:55.444
JOON: No, I have a
bit of a headache.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.185
JOHAR: You want
something for it?

21:57.228 --> 21:59.492
JOON: Always the
doctor, aren't you?

21:59.535 --> 22:01.058
I'm fine.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.843
I'll just turn in
early, I think.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.061
Next time.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.365
Stop, rewind.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.020
Play.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.592
Rewind, play.

23:04.557 --> 23:05.862

23:07.211 --> 23:08.387
Zoom in.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.131
Delete footage.

VOICE [over computer]:
Send message?

23:30.496 --> 23:31.453
JOON: No.

Save it.

23:32.715 --> 23:33.803
VOICE [over computer]:
Message saved.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.329
KURT: It was good while
it lasted, this pipeline.

23:38.373 --> 23:41.594
ROBERT: Shame to shut
it down, your colony put
a lot of work into it.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.117
KURT: So did yours.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.336
Who says science and industry
can't get along, right?

23:45.380 --> 23:48.427
MIKE: Hate to interrupt
but are we going
to do this or not?

23:48.470 --> 23:50.167
KURT: We're ready
if you're ready.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.126
ROBERT: Launch
shutoff sequence.

23:52.169 --> 23:55.477
MIKE: Affirmative,
systems ready.

23:55.521 --> 23:56.478
ROBERT: Let's do this, then.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.175
MIKE: Disengaging.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.699
And not a minute too soon.

24:04.225 --> 24:07.576
TOM: The different kinds
of people that go to Mars will
have a wildly different vision

24:07.620 --> 24:09.273
for the place.

24:11.885 --> 24:15.062
You know, you're certainly
going to have people who
really say, you know what?

24:15.105 --> 24:19.327
This is our place to mold
into something that meets
the needs of humanity.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.808
And there are other
people that are like hey,
we don't want any of that.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.593
We want to preserve
this place as it is, and
we want you to stay out.

24:30.033 --> 24:35.822
SINI: So everyone is in
the boats, so we can start
launching the kayaks.

24:35.865 --> 24:40.566
MATT: I'd describe Sini as a
bit of an activist warrior.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.744
She's just staunch
and unwavering.

24:44.787 --> 24:48.661
She doesn't have to go through
a big thought process to
know that what she's doing

24:48.704 --> 24:50.010
is right.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.665
SINI: Okay, so we launch
kayak number one first.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.799
You ready?

24:56.843 --> 24:59.367
Bridge, bridge, bridge,
this is Morpheus.

24:59.410 --> 25:03.545
Just letting you know that
we have all the four kayaks
in the water now, over.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.722
Well, I truly believe
that the people who work
on this oil rig, I mean,

25:06.766 --> 25:08.942
they are just
doing their jobs.

25:08.985 --> 25:14.861
But I would want to ask it,
like how can you sleep your
nights knowing that you do

25:14.904 --> 25:16.427
this work.

25:16.471 --> 25:19.256
There must be some sort of a
denial I think people have.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.782
MONICA: There is
a lot of anger.

25:22.825 --> 25:27.569
But I don't see just the
extremes of an industry
versus activists.

25:27.613 --> 25:33.183
We have to be
very good at challenging the
black-and-white narrative that

25:33.227 --> 25:35.577
you have to choose sides.

25:35.621 --> 25:40.582
-We on Earth have had
to struggle through
people fighting and,

25:40.626 --> 25:43.063
and warring with
each other over this.

25:43.106 --> 25:48.590
And so Mars is the test case
for how working together would
ultimately benefit us all,

25:48.634 --> 25:51.288
more than working
against each other.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.425
KURT: I guess that
makes it official.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.948
ROBERT: I have to be honest.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.907
Sorry to see it go.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.778
Enjoy spending time
with this crew.

26:02.822 --> 26:06.739
KURT: Likewise.
But hey, you're still
going to see us around.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.741
Commander says I got a bunch
of solar mirrors to make.

26:08.784 --> 26:12.179
ROBERT: Listen, we're having
a going away party tonight.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.746
It can apply to this too.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.530
You guys want to come?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.576
KURT: Of course.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.753
But if we get there and
there's no booze, there'll
be a little hell to pay.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.413
AMELIE: Javier,
we need to talk.

26:30.676 --> 26:31.764
In private.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.814
I'm pregnant.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.338
JAVIER: What?

26:41.382 --> 26:44.777
AMELIE: I am pregnant.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.780
JAVIER: How is it possible?

26:47.823 --> 26:48.955
AMELIE: I don't know.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.479
I didn't think it was.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.960
JAVIER: We're having a baby?

26:54.003 --> 26:55.483
AMELIE: [inaudible]
stop smiling.

26:55.526 --> 26:58.791
It's not a good
thing on any level.

26:58.834 --> 27:02.490
JAVIER: Okay, tell me
how I'm supposed to
feel about it, then.

27:02.533 --> 27:06.799
How to act, what to say,
since you are the one who's
making all the decisions here.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.323
AMELIE: I can't fight
with you, Javier.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.020
It's not like I planned this.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.674
JAVIER: No, you just
planned to leave.

27:18.419 --> 27:19.812
AMELIE: I don't
know what to do.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.734
JOHAR: There was no indication
that there was anything wrong.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.348
I thought she was sleeping.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.352
She's not breathing.
I need help!

27:40.049 --> 27:41.398
Defibrillator.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.272
Clear.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.553
I'm so sorry.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.256
HANA: When did this happen?

28:13.300 --> 28:15.781
JOHAR: Several hours ago.

28:15.824 --> 28:17.957
HANA: I felt it.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.306
I felt something was wrong.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.746
I pushed it out of my mind.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.487
There was so much going on.

28:36.584 --> 28:39.761
ROBERT: Now see, this is the
one thing you guys haven't
got over at your camp.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.895
KURT: Ah, well, I think our
CEO wants more output from us
before he's going to pony up

28:42.938 --> 28:45.245
any cash for a bar.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.247
ROBERT: You think
IMSF paid for this?

28:47.290 --> 28:51.468
All recovered and recycled
materials, with a little
design help from me.

28:51.512 --> 28:54.341
KURT: You're a pretty handy
guy when you're not putting
your hand in the wrong place.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.778
ROBERT: Funny.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.127
KURT: So where's the
big boss tonight?

28:58.171 --> 29:00.303
ROBERT: Knowing
her, still at work.

29:00.347 --> 29:03.437
Incredibly dedicated to
the job and the planet,
her and her sister.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.091
KURT: They're twins, right?

29:05.134 --> 29:07.136
ROBERT: Identical.

29:07.180 --> 29:11.793
HANA: I don't understand
how her doctors could miss
something like a tumor.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.490
JOHAR: Your sister
reported no symptoms,

29:13.534 --> 29:16.798
and she passed all the
routine neurological tests.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.583
There was no reason
to scan her brain.

29:19.627 --> 29:24.284
And while a meningioma
can cause seizures,
they're usually benign.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.157
We only found it because
we were looking for it.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.030
HANA: Did she know?

29:31.073 --> 29:32.161
JOHAR: She knew something.

29:36.165 --> 29:38.124
CAMERON: Do you know what
I've been meaning to ask you?

29:38.167 --> 29:41.823
JEN: Yes, and the answer
is your place, because
our colony just has bunks.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.957
And by the way,
your flirting's off
by a week or two.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.133
It's okay, I think
it's quite cute.

29:47.176 --> 29:50.832
CAMERON: Uh, that
wasn't what I was going
to ask you, though.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.965
JEN: Well, that is awkward.

29:53.008 --> 29:56.533
CAMERON: Mm. Well,
there's nothing
awkward about you.

29:56.577 --> 30:00.102
That is uh, strictly
my department, so.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.843
JEN: So go on, then.
What's your question?

30:01.887 --> 30:05.499
CAMERON: Mm, I was
just wondering what you
think about being here?

30:05.542 --> 30:07.153
JEN: In your colony?

30:07.196 --> 30:09.590
CAMERON: On the planet.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.853
JEN: I think it's amazing.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.073
To be somewhere no
one else has been.

30:14.116 --> 30:17.250
I didn't just come
here for work, though.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.211
I came here for the adventure.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.301
CAMERON: Yeah, me too.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.791
MARTA: Yeah, so, anyway.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.185
I wonder where Amelie is.

30:39.228 --> 30:41.317
She's missing her own party.

30:41.361 --> 30:44.886
CAMERON: Uh, I'm sure
she'll be here soon.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.541
JEN: Maybe Shep can
keep you company if
you're feeling lonely.

31:00.249 --> 31:02.164
CAMERON: Yup, see you later.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.128
JOHAR: We found lamotrigine
in her bloodstream.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.567
HANA: So this wasn't
her only seizure.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.917
She was taking
medication for them.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.788
JOHAR: Yes.

31:17.832 --> 31:20.400
The sort an ordinary blood
test wouldn't screen for.

31:21.618 --> 31:24.621
Which leads me to believe
that she was trying to manage
symptoms outside of the

31:24.665 --> 31:26.667
agency's purview.

31:26.710 --> 31:31.541
HANA: Because if they had
known she was sick, she
couldn't have come here.

31:38.679 --> 31:43.249
AMELIE: No one really knows
how being on a planet with
lower gravity and higher

31:43.292 --> 31:45.947
radiation exposure
affects pregnancy.

31:45.991 --> 31:50.604
JAVIER: No one knows what
traveling for seven months
in zero gravity and even more

31:50.647 --> 31:52.301
radiation does, either.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.609
AMELIE: Full-term
pregnancy might not even
be viable either way.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.306
JAVIER: So you're
talking about.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.047
AMELIE: Yes, Javier.

31:59.091 --> 32:03.095
An abortion might be
the best choice, given
all the risks involved.

32:03.138 --> 32:07.534
JAVIER: The problem is
there is nothing certain
about any of this.

32:07.577 --> 32:09.449
AMELIE: No, that's not true.

32:09.492 --> 32:13.757
If this baby is born on Mars,
and even if it's healthy,

32:14.149 --> 32:17.413
neither its bones nor its organs

32:17.457 --> 32:20.634
could ever withstand the
gravitational forces on Earth.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.204
JAVIER: It could
never leave here.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.349
SHEP: I've always
loved science.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.350
MARTA: Really?

32:41.394 --> 32:42.569
SHEP: Yeah.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.484
I did pretty well with
it in school, too.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.529
It was my dad who pulled me
into the mining business.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.140
MARTA: So it runs
in the family?

32:48.183 --> 32:49.880
SHEP: Yeah, yeah,
you could say that.

32:49.924 --> 32:52.579
Though I don't think
he ever thought I would
be mining in space.

32:52.622 --> 32:57.714
So what, I'm guessing
you like, what, you
wanted to come here, right?

32:57.758 --> 33:02.850
MARTA: I didn't start
out wanting to travel to
distant planets. Uh-uh.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.199
SHEP: No?
MARTA: Uh-uh.

33:04.243 --> 33:07.681
But I guess it was a
natural extension of the, well,

33:07.724 --> 33:09.857
the research I'm
devoting my life to.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.902
SHEP: Hmm, you know what
that sounds like to me?

33:11.946 --> 33:13.730
MARTA: No.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.820
SHEP: That you work
too hard, and you need
to have a little fun.

33:18.431 --> 33:21.695
MARTA: I don't know, I'm,
I'm having fun right now.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.044
SHEP: Yeah?

33:23.088 --> 33:25.699
Well it's too bad we
couldn't have met sooner.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.702
I'm not going to be around
much longer now that we found
that ice shelf to tap into.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.008
MARTA: Well, that was lucky.

33:30.051 --> 33:31.748
SHEP: No, no.
Finding water, that was lucky.

33:31.792 --> 33:34.360
MARTA: What do you mean?

33:34.403 --> 33:37.232
Are you saying that
you found liquid water?

33:37.276 --> 33:39.060
SHEP: Yeah.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.975
KURT: I think old Shep here
has had enough to drink.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.759
MARTA: Are you serious?

33:42.803 --> 33:44.500
KURT: As a matter of
fact, it's probably time
we all get back to camp.

33:44.544 --> 33:47.199
MARTA: So is this,
is this true?

33:47.242 --> 33:48.939
KURT: Alright guys, let's go.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.941
MARTA: Because if it
is, you need to tell us
where you located it.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.073
KURT: Potentially located it.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.901
We haven't exactly
gotten to it yet.

33:53.944 --> 33:55.337
MARTA: What sector is it in?

33:55.381 --> 33:57.383
KURT: I'm not at liberty
to share that information.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.385
Guys, let's not forget
to thank our host.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.995
MARTA: You don't understand.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.824
Liquid water almost certainly
has other life forms in it.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.869
That's what we're
here to research.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.871
KURT: That may be why you're
here, but it's definitely
not why we're here.

34:07.915 --> 34:10.352
Now, if you'll excuse me.

34:10.396 --> 34:13.964
MARTA: No. What you're
doing is not right.

34:14.008 --> 34:15.488
KURT: Come on,
guys, let's go.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.359
MARTA: No, this is wrong.
What you're doing is wrong!

34:17.403 --> 34:20.406
KURT: Enough!
You wait a second.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.408
I got to say,
I really don't feel like
having a debate about it.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.410
MARTA: This is not a debate.

34:24.453 --> 34:27.108
You can't just drill
and contaminate something
before it can be studied.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.458
KURT: I got some news
for you, darling.

34:29.502 --> 34:34.420
The fact that you, me, we're
all here, means it's already
contaminated, so if you don't.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.770
MARTA: You need to tell
us where the water is.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.815
KURT: You need to get
your damn hands off me.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.121
MARTA: You think we're
going to let you and your
company wreck this planet?

34:40.165 --> 34:42.080
ROBERT: Okay, stop it.

34:46.823 --> 34:48.042
KURT: You're one crazy
bitch, you know that?

34:55.310 --> 34:56.355
MAN: Get off of me!

34:57.660 --> 35:01.490
MAN 2: Break it
up, break it up!

35:01.534 --> 35:03.840
Lukrum out!

35:03.884 --> 35:05.886
MIKE: Every one
of you here, now!

35:05.929 --> 35:08.584
-Knock it off!
-Let's go!

35:08.628 --> 35:09.629
KURT: That's it.

35:09.672 --> 35:10.760
Party's over.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.153
Let's go home.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.937
You too.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.026
Back up, back up,
back up, come on.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.680
Easy, tough guy.

35:17.724 --> 35:18.768
MARTA: Let me go!

35:23.512 --> 35:25.993
You.

35:26.036 --> 35:30.171
This planet doesn't
belong to you.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.521
It doesn't belong to anyone.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.828
Especially if
there's life here.

35:37.787 --> 35:41.574
KURT: For the record,
tell your boss your guy
threw the first punch.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.419
SINI [over radio]:
Bridge, bridge, bridge,
this is Morpheus.

36:00.462 --> 36:02.247
MIKE: Morpheus,
Bridge, go ahead.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.336
SINI: So we are going
to start going in now.

36:04.379 --> 36:07.165
MIKE [over radio]: Copy that,
thank you, good luck.

36:08.383 --> 36:11.691
-I'm a very practical person,
and I'm not very patient.

36:11.734 --> 36:17.697
We have so many environmental
crises heading against
us, and so little time left.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.874
So I feel like I
don't have a choice.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.920
I have to fight this
battle for the future.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.922
MAN [over radio]:
Arctic Sunrise, this
is Tsonga Enabler.

36:25.966 --> 36:29.404
All breach of the 500-meter
safety zone is not legal, sir.

36:30.884 --> 36:34.801
So this will be
the last request that
you need to relocate.

36:34.844 --> 36:37.412
If not, we will regard
this as a security threat.

36:37.456 --> 36:41.547
MATT: The activists have
entered the exclusion zone.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.245
The oil rig has
stopped operations.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.247
They won't comment on that.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.772
But they're not allowed to
continue drilling for oil.

36:49.816 --> 36:53.385
MIKE: Morpheus, Bridge,
go ahead with connection.

36:54.603 --> 36:57.737
MATT: The longer we stay
here, the more people
start looking at this,

36:57.780 --> 36:59.826
and it highlights
this operation.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.655
SINI: Uh, just
to let you know that the
connection is completed,

37:02.698 --> 37:04.091
the connection is completed.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.397
Standing by.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.746
MIKE: Copy that.

37:06.789 --> 37:07.964
Standing by.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.792
We'll see what happens.

37:09.836 --> 37:13.796
-When we're looking
at Mars, and companies
wanting to go to Mars,

37:13.840 --> 37:19.106
I think people will find a way
to protect the planet, just
like they're doing right now.

37:19.149 --> 37:23.545
And that's not just in the
Arctic, but everywhere.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.634
AMY: People have gone
through the fence.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.984
The bulldozers
are still going.

37:28.028 --> 37:31.423
ANTONIA: A lot of people right
now aren't seeing change, and
aren't seeing it happen fast

37:31.466 --> 37:36.950
enough, and see that at this
stage, they simply need to
put their bodies on the line.

37:36.993 --> 37:41.128
REPORTER: Police attempts to
move protestors voluntarily
were ineffectual.

37:41.171 --> 37:45.611
NAOMI: These battles
right now against new
fossil fuel pipelines,

37:45.654 --> 37:49.397
and new drilling
in the Arctic.

37:49.615 --> 37:55.185
Are not just a battle between
oil companies and protesters,
it's a battle of worldviews.

37:55.969 --> 37:59.799
MIKE [over radio]: We
are not complying with
the Coast Guard request.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.714
Are you comfortable with that?

38:01.757 --> 38:05.326
SINI: Uh, we will continue
protesting against
the oil drilling, over.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.808
NEWT: If people want a hobby
of chaining themselves to oil
platforms, you know, I'd say,

38:08.851 --> 38:10.113
go do it.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.378
I mean, it's wonderful to
live in a free country where
you can go do weird things.

38:13.421 --> 38:16.337
But the truth is,
it won't matter.

38:16.381 --> 38:19.645
Preservationists are moving
against the tide of history.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.957
MIKE: Looks like Coast
Guard is approaching.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.052
NEWT: What right do you
have to deny the future?

38:36.096 --> 38:41.101
I don't know of any
historic civilization where
the preservationists won.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.322
I mean, in the long run,
they get drowned by progress.

38:51.590 --> 38:56.029
JOEL: For protestors, this
is a symbolic gesture, but how
effective they are at actually

38:56.072 --> 38:57.683
stopping things, I don't know.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.294
It's like throwing
stones at Goliath.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.819
WOMAN: You have to take the
people out from the water.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.386
That's an order.

39:05.430 --> 39:06.909
You have to do that.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.525
MIKE: Morpheus, Bridge,
the ship has been arrested.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.483
You can come back to the ship.

39:21.097 --> 39:24.405
SINI: In order to do this,
you have to believe that
the change is possible.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.538
Otherwise, we wouldn't
be achieving for it.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.235
Otherwise, we wouldn't
be fighting for it.

39:30.846 --> 39:33.893
I'm a little bit worried
that it's not going
to happen fast enough.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.199
But uh, we are pushing for it.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.853
Yeah.

39:39.246 --> 39:43.598
-On Mars, there
will be a push, a cause,
to maybe do better there

39:43.642 --> 39:45.818
than we've done here.

39:45.861 --> 39:49.430
To maybe protect that
beautiful red planet in a way
that we were unable to protect

39:49.474 --> 39:51.432
the Earth.

39:51.476 --> 39:54.435
But I'm not sure how
successful that will be.

we're good Saga III.

Saga III, you're going home.

I wasn't sure what.
