WEBVTT

00:05.006 --> 00:07.006
(Clanging)
(Whistling, whooping)

00:07.008 --> 00:07.740
Here, snipe!

00:07.742 --> 00:09.074
Come here, snipe!

00:09.076 --> 00:10.743
Here, snipe!

00:10.745 --> 00:12.344
Come here, snipe!

00:12.346 --> 00:13.345
Snipe!

00:13.347 --> 00:15.047
Where are you, snipe?

00:15.049 --> 00:16.315
Hey, uh, dad,

00:16.317 --> 00:18.150
what do snipes
look like again?

00:18.152 --> 00:19.585
Ugly.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.654
Sharp teeth,
beady little eyes.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.406
You'll know one when you
see it. Keep looking.

00:24.407 --> 00:26.157
Run up ahead and see if you can
scare them out of their holes.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.960
But remember,

00:27.961 --> 00:29.761
they're attracted
to loud noise.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.732
Here, snipe!
Here, snipe!

00:33.734 --> 00:36.035
(Laughter)
Here, snipe!

00:36.037 --> 00:37.403
All right, let's see
how this snipe's looking, huh?

00:37.405 --> 00:38.470
Yeah, come on.
Here, snipe!

00:38.472 --> 00:40.205
(Laughter)
Here, snipe!

00:40.207 --> 00:41.173
Call the boys.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.574
Hey, boys!
Dad, hurry!

00:42.576 --> 00:44.143
I think we found something!
Holy cow!

00:47.148 --> 00:49.615
What you got, boys?

00:49.617 --> 00:52.217
¶ ¶

00:52.219 --> 00:53.619
oh, my god.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:53.621 --> 00:54.653
Shh.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.155
Don't look, don't look.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.222
It's gonna be okay.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.791
That's not a snipe.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.327
(Phones ringing)

01:35.329 --> 01:37.796
Tony: Well, that's very nice,
but, you know,

01:37.798 --> 01:41.133
when I told you to get buffed,
that's not quite what I meant.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.469
Go ahead, Tony, let's go.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.170
Come on, I can take it.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.405
Might as well get them all done
at the same time.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.673
Nailed it!

01:47.675 --> 01:49.174
(Chuckles)

01:49.176 --> 01:51.393
They're gonna keep coming.

01:51.394 --> 01:53.611
Delilah says you cannot spell
manicure without m-a-n.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.880
Tony:
Good for you, Tim.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.682
Denial is the key
to happiness.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.250
Please, like you've never
gotten manicures before.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.251
I've seen your cuticles.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.486
Oh, no.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.121
Dinozzos are
genetically predisposed

02:02.123 --> 02:03.288
to perfect hygiene.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.656
God's gift, I guess.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.258
Although dad has started
getting pedicures,

02:06.260 --> 02:08.360
but the toes are old.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.629
Oh, hey, bishop.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.564
We need a little
female perspective.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.901
Although Tim is bringing
quite a bit to the game.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.469
Not today, Tony.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.271
You two figure it out.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.245
You okay?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.779
Everything back
to normal at home?

02:27.781 --> 02:29.148
Jake is safe.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.382
That's all that matters.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.218
Well, that's not
the only thing that matters.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.553
You do, too.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.456
Jake went through
a traumatic experience.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.224
As did you.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.159
And, remember, he wasn't

02:40.161 --> 02:41.493
in the bombing.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.828
Right, um, you know,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.229
can we just not talk
about this right now?

02:44.231 --> 02:46.665
I was hoping for a quiet day.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.501
What?

02:49.503 --> 02:50.869
She said it.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.271
I'm surprised it hasn't
happened sooner, frankly.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.506
What hasn't happened?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.508
It's an NCIS thing, okay?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.178
You never say "good luck"
in the theater.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.546
You never say
"hey, good game,"

03:00.548 --> 03:02.281
to a pitcher who's in
the middle of a no-hitter.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.767
And you never,

03:04.768 --> 03:07.252
ever say what you just said
in the big orange room.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.688
Wow. Superstitious much?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.356
These are not superstitions.
They are facts.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.457
Hmm, okay.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.859
Here's a fact.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.194
We probably won't even
get a case today.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.262
Too late.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.397
Dead body in the Virginia woods.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.965
Let's go.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.569
Nice nails, Tim.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.836
Oh, thanks, boss.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.405
You know, Delilah said...
Of course.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.941
You can't spell manicure
without m-a-n.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.776
(Elevator bell dings)
See that?

03:30.778 --> 03:32.244
Hmm.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.413
(Camera shutter clicking)

03:35.249 --> 03:37.416
(Birds screeching)
(Sighs)

03:37.418 --> 03:39.585
I need to get
out of the city more often.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.853
Clear my head.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.623
Yes, a breath of fresh air
can work wonders.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.826
Did you know that just listening
to the tree branches rustle

03:47.828 --> 03:48.994
in the Autumn breeze

03:48.996 --> 03:51.530
can reduce your
blood pressure

03:51.532 --> 03:53.232
by about ten points?

03:53.234 --> 03:54.700
For me it's all about listening
to the zen-like call

03:54.702 --> 03:56.969
of a bird.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.438
(Imitates birdsong)

03:59.440 --> 04:00.939
(Bird repeats song)

04:00.941 --> 04:03.575
That's the warbling vireo,
indigenous to these parts.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.578
Gibbs:
T.O.D., duck?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.680
Uh, I'm going
to let birdman here

04:08.682 --> 04:09.982
hazard a guess.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.283
He's doing a night course

04:11.285 --> 04:13.285
in the science
of human decay.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.254
It's fascinating stuff, really.

04:15.256 --> 04:19.424
My final essay was entitled
"decomposition composition."

04:19.426 --> 04:20.425
(Chuckles)

04:20.427 --> 04:22.427
Let's see here.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.364
Uh, judging by the minor
putrefaction of the body

04:25.366 --> 04:26.765
as well as the presence

04:26.767 --> 04:28.800
of maggot larvae
on the wound here

04:28.802 --> 04:30.435
and the brown purge fluids

04:30.437 --> 04:32.871
leaking from every orifice,
i would have to say

04:32.873 --> 04:34.973
between 48 and 72 hours.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.708
The bullet pierced
the trachea

04:36.710 --> 04:38.343
and presumably exited
the back of the neck.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.379
And notice
how the extremities

04:40.381 --> 04:41.647
have been eaten

04:41.649 --> 04:42.914
by wildlife.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.717
Fingertips, the ears.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.352
Well, no fingertips, no prints.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.421
I'm go go prep
a DNA test for Abby.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.823
Tony:
State trooper says a car

04:51.825 --> 04:53.759
was towed from the shoulder
of the road just down the hill.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.661
They're still
running the plates.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.063
I'll cross-check dmv for
the<i> Buchanan's</i> manifest.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.199
She was a destroyer

05:00.200 --> 05:02.334
in the persian Gulf during
operation desert shield.

05:02.336 --> 05:05.304
The ship's unofficial motto was

05:05.306 --> 05:07.406
"defending with honor."

05:07.408 --> 05:08.974
(Camera shutter clicks)

05:08.976 --> 05:10.409
McGee:
Boss.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.411
Bolt-action Winchester,
thirty-ought-six.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.879
Definitely been fired.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.315
Okay. Fired at what?

05:16.317 --> 05:17.849
It is deer season.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.551
Guy's not dressed
for deer hunting.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.852
Suicide?

05:20.854 --> 05:24.323
Possibly, but the angle
is unlikely.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.625
I don't know.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.694
Maybe he was sitting here,
just thinking about life,

05:28.696 --> 05:30.896
and thought,
"maybe I can take myself out."

05:30.898 --> 05:32.331
Boom!

05:32.333 --> 05:34.366
Goes right out back
through the neck.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.902
Yeah, and it landed
where exactly?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.573
Hey, boss?

05:41.575 --> 05:44.676
I found the bullet lodged
in this unlucky pine tree.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.777
Dig it out.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.845
Don't damage the bullet

05:46.847 --> 05:48.413
or the tree.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.581
All right.
Hey, McGee,

05:49.583 --> 05:51.450
why don't you do
the digging?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.352
That seems to be
your specialty.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.087
And ruin the manicure?

05:55.089 --> 05:56.421
That's not gonna happen.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.489
Oh.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.361
So if our victim killed himself,

06:02.363 --> 06:05.497
I guess we're looking
at an open-and-shut case.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.100
Quiet day after all.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.468
(Phone chimes)

06:09.470 --> 06:11.937
And that should be our I.D.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.106
(Muttering):
Unbelievable.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.145
Ow!

06:20.147 --> 06:21.980
Told you, be gentle.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.383
Splinter?
It's like the
whole tree went in there.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.450
Look at that.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.386
I better go get
the first-aid kit.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.788
There's a lot of bacteria
in these old tress, Tony.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.857
Might have to amputate.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.925
Well, dots connect.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.427
Car belonged to retired

06:35.429 --> 06:37.496
lieutenant commander
runyan Hayes,

06:37.498 --> 06:39.464
63 years old,

06:39.466 --> 06:41.933
formerly assigned
to the USS<i> Buchanan.</i>

06:41.935 --> 06:43.468
Two days ago,
his granddaughter

06:43.470 --> 06:45.003
reported him missing.

06:45.005 --> 06:48.006
Did you say lieutenant commander
runyan Hayes?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.641
You know him?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.843
Jethro, I need a word with you.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.415
I'm afraid I must
recuse myself from this case.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.749
I don't follow.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.985
Well, because I know far more

06:59.987 --> 07:03.588
about this man's murder
than I care to admit.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.501
Did you know, commander,
that the trees

07:16.503 --> 07:18.637
in gettysburg, Pennsylvania,

07:18.639 --> 07:22.441
absorbed thousands of gunshots

07:22.443 --> 07:24.142
in the civil war?

07:24.144 --> 07:26.645
Historians call them

07:26.647 --> 07:28.046
the "witness trees."

07:28.048 --> 07:30.582
Tree's not a witness
unless it testifies, duck.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.616
What do you got?

07:31.618 --> 07:33.118
Well, commander Hayes here,

07:33.120 --> 07:36.488
he did not die
of a self-inflicted gunshot.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.190
I know. What else?

07:38.191 --> 07:39.891
Oh, speak to a man
named Todd Bennett.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.160
He's a fireman in
wolf trap, Virginia.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.563
That's all I'm gonna to say.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.499
I'm going to call another
medical examiner

07:47.501 --> 07:49.234
to take over the case.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.636
I can't let you off
that easy, ducky.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.673
You most certainly can.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.642
How did you know the commander?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.847
Well, it's no secret

08:01.849 --> 08:03.515
that my social life of late

08:03.517 --> 08:06.618
has not exactly been<i> en fuego.</i>

08:07.554 --> 08:10.255
Come on, duck.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.723
(Chuckles)

08:11.725 --> 08:13.191
You still got it.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.793
Perhaps.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.094
I've tried everything.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.562
Online dating.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.130
That was a fiasco.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.699
Speed dating introduced me

08:20.701 --> 08:23.068
to women that I disliked
even faster.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.604
So, I decided to try

08:25.606 --> 08:27.072
mental stimulation,

08:27.074 --> 08:29.274
and I joined a group
of mystery enthusiasts

08:29.276 --> 08:31.643
who solve cold cases.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.512
Amateur detectives.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.813
We call ourselves

08:34.815 --> 08:37.749
"the Sherlock consortium
for investigation."

08:37.751 --> 08:40.552
Three weeks ago,

08:40.554 --> 08:42.554
the commander reached out to us.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.823
He was desperate.

08:44.824 --> 08:47.091
He told us that his son,
Michael, was serving

08:47.094 --> 08:49.227
a life sentence
for a military murder

08:49.229 --> 08:52.297
that Hayes insisted
the boy didn't commit.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.666
He said the guilty man was...

08:54.668 --> 08:57.636
Todd Bennett, the fireman.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.271
And he was going
to confront Bennett

08:59.273 --> 09:00.839
and get him to confess.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.674
We advised against it.

09:02.676 --> 09:06.745
You think that Bennett
killed Hayes to shut him up?

09:07.881 --> 09:10.882
Oh, oh, but, Jethro,
keep the sherlocks out of this.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.851
Anonymity is

09:12.853 --> 09:14.786
of the utmost importance.

09:14.788 --> 09:15.987
Hey, duck,

09:15.989 --> 09:17.689
next time you're feeling lonely,

09:17.691 --> 09:20.058
read a book.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.830
All right, I'm listening.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.065
Oh.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.568
So, our, uh, victim, boss,

09:29.570 --> 09:31.920
is retired lieutenant
commander runyan Hayes.

09:31.921 --> 09:34.271
Fought in three wars on two
continents over four decades.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.975
He worked two jobs to support
his granddaughter,

09:36.977 --> 09:38.944
makaela, she's 17.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.178
What is that?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.980
It's a clicker.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.915
No, on your finger.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.350
It's a banana peel.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.686
Tony got himself an owie.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.020
Tony:
It's an Abby thing.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.221
She told me that there's

09:50.223 --> 09:52.824
these special enzymes
in the banana peel

09:52.826 --> 09:54.626
that help, uh, extract...
DiNozzo.

09:54.628 --> 09:55.827
Sit down.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.896
Abby stuff.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.164
Bananas.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.833
Bishop?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.969
That's runyan's son,
Michael Hayes,

10:03.971 --> 10:07.138
inmate number 37260.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.674
In 1999, Michael was a seaman

10:09.676 --> 10:13.778
aboard the USS<i> saxton, </i>
when his division officer,

10:13.780 --> 10:15.146
lieutenant junior grade
Brett swannie,

10:15.148 --> 10:16.848
was strangled and killed.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.216
The original suspect
in swannie's death

10:18.218 --> 10:19.351
was a fellow
sailor onboard,

10:19.353 --> 10:21.786
Todd Bennett.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.054
He had an argument
with the lieutenant

10:23.056 --> 10:24.623
the night before
he was murdered.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.475
Bennett was never arrested.

10:26.476 --> 10:28.326
Hairs found on swannie's body
matched the younger Hayes,

10:28.328 --> 10:30.061
and that was that.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.763
As far as Bennett,

10:31.765 --> 10:33.732
he now works as a firefighter

10:33.733 --> 10:35.700
only two miles away from
where the commander was shot.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.836
Bishop, you're with me.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.337
Let's go.
Abby: Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

10:39.339 --> 10:40.705
Yeah, Abbs, what?

10:40.707 --> 10:41.806
I have good news.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.208
It's weird, but good.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.744
Um, the bullet in the tree

10:45.746 --> 10:47.912
did, in fact, come
from commander Hayes's rifle.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.882
The weird good part is
it didn't kill anybody.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.050
Well, how do you know that?

10:52.052 --> 10:54.653
Because there's
no human remains on it.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.820
I mean, there's no way that

10:55.822 --> 10:57.122
it could have passed
through flesh

10:57.124 --> 10:58.890
and not picked up
some tiny little

10:58.892 --> 11:00.759
DNA hitchhikers along the way.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.961
So the commander was killed
by another bullet?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.663
Shot by another gun.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.298
DiNozzo, take McGee with you,
go back to the crime scene.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.933
Find evidence
of another shooter.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.368
Oh, great.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.871
You mean go back to the poison
oak and land of splinters.

11:12.873 --> 11:13.872
(Clicks)

11:13.874 --> 11:14.906
I'll take it out.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.008
I'm good, boss, thanks.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.810
No, I'm good.
(Knife blade clicks,
retracting)

11:21.048 --> 11:23.815
My version is a lot
more civilized.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.284
Not popular with Gibbs.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.452
Look!

11:27.454 --> 11:29.354
The little guy
worked its way right...

11:29.356 --> 11:31.690
Out of your skin.
(Squeaking)

11:31.692 --> 11:32.791
Oh!

11:32.793 --> 11:34.259
Good job, little guy.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.294
Good job!
Okay...

11:36.296 --> 11:40.031
Dear noble eastern white pine:

11:40.033 --> 11:42.967
Thank you for
your brave sacrifice.

11:42.969 --> 11:46.137
And Tony is<i> very</i> sorry

11:46.139 --> 11:47.806
that he attacked you

11:47.808 --> 11:48.840
with his knife.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.775
And we promise

11:50.777 --> 11:53.278
that we will find
and punish the person

11:53.280 --> 11:54.479
that shot you.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.947
The end.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.082
Okay.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.417
Abby loves trees.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.823
(Woodpecker pecking wood
in distance)

12:04.825 --> 12:06.991
I'd like to cut you down
and use you for firewood

12:06.993 --> 12:08.193
all winter long.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.461
Okay, don't even
joke about that.

12:09.463 --> 12:10.462
You heard Abby,

12:10.464 --> 12:11.463
you know what
you have to say.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.797
I don't want to say it.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.132
You're gonna say it.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.433
(Inhaling deeply)

12:15.435 --> 12:17.836
Dear noble eastern
white pine...

12:17.838 --> 12:19.104
(Sighing)

12:19.106 --> 12:21.239
...this is from Abby Sciuto.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.076
She said you would know
what to do with it.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.745
There you go.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.179
There, I said it.
Are you happy?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.749
I'm happy, and Abby
will be very happy.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.321
McGee:
All right.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.388
There we go.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.527
Mm.
Trajectory doesn't match.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.095
Well...

12:44.097 --> 12:46.164
Body's over there.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.899
This bullet came
from that direction.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.969
Anything?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.370
Uh, not yet.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.772
Hey, look,

12:53.774 --> 12:55.240
you're getting it
hung up on the trees.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.941
Bullets don't bend, McGee.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.912
I found something.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.847
Ooh!

13:03.984 --> 13:05.884
It's a wallet.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.118
Look at that.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.188
It's the commander's wallet.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.790
Ooh.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.859
So, if commander Hayes
was standing here

13:14.861 --> 13:15.994
when he shot his rifle...

13:15.996 --> 13:17.495
McGee:
Most likely at the killer.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.264
The killer
would've fired back,

13:19.266 --> 13:20.799
hitting him in the neck.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.901
Blood spatter would be...

13:24.271 --> 13:26.337
...right there.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.241
There it is.
Bullet hole.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.283
Tony: Bet this bullet has
the commander's DNA.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.251
All we gotta do
is find the gun.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.520
You know what? I'm not too sure
there's a bullet in here.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.956
I think someone dug it out.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.091
(Laughing): McGee, what
are you talking about?

13:47.093 --> 13:49.060
Well, do you see it?
Look...

13:49.062 --> 13:51.162
It's hidden by
that sticky sap.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.832
Tony, if there was a bullet
in there,

13:53.834 --> 13:55.533
I am perfectly capable of...
Ow!

13:56.870 --> 13:58.303
(Tony groans)

13:58.305 --> 13:59.504
Trees.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.876
Faster, ladies!
You're three seconds behind!

14:04.878 --> 14:07.112
Let's go!

14:07.113 --> 14:09.347
Three seconds
could cost a kid his life!

14:09.349 --> 14:12.917
Stop! Let's do it again,
no mistakes!

14:12.919 --> 14:14.619
Gibbs:
Todd Bennett?

14:14.621 --> 14:17.388
NCIS.
Special agent bishop

14:17.390 --> 14:19.290
and Gibbs.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.325
(Indistinct radio
communication in background)

14:20.327 --> 14:22.060
That your truck?

14:22.062 --> 14:24.229
Where's the rifle
for the rack?

14:24.231 --> 14:25.430
I have a permit.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.232
That's not what
i asked you.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.800
Hmph.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.367
There someplace private
we can talk?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.304
There's nothing
my boys can't hear.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.374
You know a retired Navy
officer named runyan Hayes?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.042
Yeah, I know him.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.445
He's been accusing me of murder
for the past 16 years.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.546
When was the last time
you saw him?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.047
Couple weeks back.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.350
He showed up here
and wanted me to confess.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.920
Only problem is, I don't have
anything to confess to.

14:49.890 --> 14:50.989
And go!

14:53.293 --> 14:54.559
That's when he took off.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.294
And no, I didn't follow him.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.363
And no, I didn't kill him.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.399
Commander Hayes's death
isn't public information.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.902
How do you know about it?

15:03.904 --> 15:05.503
Private investigator
told me.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.406
What private investigator?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.974
Big government agents

15:09.976 --> 15:11.976
can't even figure out
who's working the case.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.913
You got a name?

15:16.416 --> 15:19.250
(Sighs)
It was a woman. Older.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.451
She left a card.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.957
Ducky:
<i> Membership to the sherlocks</i>

15:25.959 --> 15:28.927
is a closely
guarded secret.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.328
I'll speak to them,
personally.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.563
No, I'll speak to them
personally.

15:32.565 --> 15:36.367
Jethro, that would be
a dreadful... horrible idea.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.236
Why?

15:38.238 --> 15:41.406
(Groans) The sherlocks
are some of the most unique

15:41.408 --> 15:43.408
and forward-thinking
criminologists

15:43.410 --> 15:44.542
I've encountered!

15:44.544 --> 15:46.311
But...

15:46.313 --> 15:49.380
(Quietly): They do not
play well with others.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.950
Neither do I.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.318
<i> (Doorbell chimes)</i>

15:53.320 --> 15:55.386
(Clock ticking quietly)

15:58.458 --> 15:59.724
Butler:
Dr. Mallard.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.592
Good evening,
stephenson.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.194
Is this somebody's home?

16:03.196 --> 16:04.996
Oh, it's a family
residence

16:04.998 --> 16:07.298
handed down from generation
to generation.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.299
Hmm.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.467
(Door closes)

16:09.469 --> 16:12.670
(Clock chiming)

16:12.672 --> 16:14.372
Can we just go in, duck?

16:21.381 --> 16:25.116
Your secret knock is
"shave and a haircut"?

16:25.118 --> 16:26.417
Irony.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.552
(Lock buzzes, latch clicks)

16:30.757 --> 16:32.423
Donald, you're late.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.731
It looks like
we're right on time.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.215
Walt osorio,
consulting detective

16:57.217 --> 16:58.649
for the Sherlock consortium.

16:58.651 --> 17:02.453
Uh, you must be
special agent Gibbs, NCIS?

17:02.455 --> 17:05.189
And special agent bishop.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.091
We're looking for
Judith mcknight?

17:07.093 --> 17:08.626
Speaking.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.296
And listening, to hear if you
have anything worthwhile to say.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.232
(Clock chimes)

17:14.234 --> 17:15.666
That's what I thought.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.502
The quiet, brooding type.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.803
Oh, Judith, please!

17:18.805 --> 17:21.406
Anybody want a drink?
I need one.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.708
Did you talk to a fireman
named Todd Bennett?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.510
Don't answer that, Judith.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.578
You have a very
commanding voice,

17:27.580 --> 17:29.447
special agent Gibbs.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.382
And big hands.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.867
Oh, boy.

17:32.868 --> 17:34.351
Ducky:
Fellow sherlocks...

17:34.354 --> 17:38.222
I must apologize for breaking
the seal of secrecy,

17:38.224 --> 17:41.459
but NCIS is now formally taking
over the investigation

17:41.461 --> 17:43.728
of lieutenant commander
runyan Hayes,

17:43.730 --> 17:45.730
so, please, please,

17:45.732 --> 17:49.133
hand over any information
that you may have gathered.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.269
Just like that,
eh, Donald?

17:51.271 --> 17:54.305
Well, Walter,
you've always know that if

17:54.307 --> 17:57.241
my vocation and avocation
intersect,

17:57.243 --> 17:58.509
then my loyalties...
(Wry chuckle)

17:58.511 --> 18:01.145
Well, they must remain
with NCIS.

18:01.147 --> 18:04.715
Well, according
to city code 348-61,

18:04.717 --> 18:07.685
the Sherlock consortium
is not legally bound

18:07.687 --> 18:10.421
to, quote: Engage in

18:10.423 --> 18:12.423
interagency cooperation.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.792
You're not
a government agency.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.462
Actually,
the Sherlock consortium

18:17.464 --> 18:19.163
is a federally
registered...

18:19.165 --> 18:20.298
Who are you?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.499
I'm Lyle.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.800
Shut up, Lyle.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.571
Gibbs, there are police files,
attorney e-mails,

18:26.573 --> 18:28.206
divorce papers,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.141
all private documents--
how did you get these?

18:30.143 --> 18:33.377
What we do and how we do it
is our business.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.779
Our business now.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.681
Lyle: Hey, we spent days
gathering this evidence.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.116
You can't just take a shortcut

18:38.118 --> 18:40.218
to get to the finish
line before us.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.486
Okay?
Ducky: Lyle...

18:41.488 --> 18:43.354
This is not a contest.

18:43.356 --> 18:47.391
You've made your allegiances
very clear, Donald.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.495
Special agent Gibbs, there must
be a way we could work this out.

18:50.497 --> 18:55.399
Wait, I just want you to keep it
here, just for... aah!

18:55.401 --> 18:57.535
We're doing this
the hard way.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.239
I like the hard way.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.743
(Handcuffs ratcheting)

19:05.745 --> 19:07.812
(Groans quietly)

19:07.814 --> 19:10.681
So, leader of the wacko brigade
is named Walt osario.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.718
Goes by "consulting
detective."

19:13.720 --> 19:16.554
Same title as Sherlock Holmes,
by the way.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.389
Ex-cop from New Hampshire.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.591
Five years ago,
budget cut forced him out.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.262
Playing the role
of Mr. Watson

19:24.264 --> 19:25.563
is Judith mcknight.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.231
She has no actual

19:27.233 --> 19:28.733
law enforcement experience.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.701
She's an author
of airport

19:30.703 --> 19:32.904
paperback novels.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.572
Don't knock
the Pulp Fiction, bish.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.942
You're talking about McGee's
retirement account there.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.577
That's Judith mcknight.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.946
Judith mcknight?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.448
Diamond delancy
mysteries, no?

19:44.450 --> 19:47.251
14-year-old crime fighting
girl, with pigtails?

19:47.253 --> 19:49.420
And...
Okay, well,

19:49.422 --> 19:50.721
you're missing out.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.423
Mcknight is unbelievable.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.659
Hmm.
And boy, did she hit
the mother lode.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.395
Oh! Well, if she's loaded...

19:57.397 --> 19:59.597
Maybe I can set her up
with my dad.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.399
He's broke.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.501
Anyway, moving on
to Lyle:

20:03.503 --> 20:04.635
Last name unknown.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.937
Date of birth: Unknown.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.805
His only I.D. Card...

20:07.807 --> 20:11.509
Hey! He's a platinum member
of the frequent eater's club

20:11.511 --> 20:12.543
at popper's pizza.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.678
And that's it.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.346
You think he's a threat?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.481
I would say,
to a two-topping
medium pizza,

20:17.483 --> 20:19.217
he's a severe threat.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.952
Those three lunatics
are in the conference room.

20:20.954 --> 20:23.287
Find out what they know
and get 'em outta here.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.923
The three of ya.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.758
Go!

20:31.698 --> 20:33.531
Let me get this bad boy
autographed.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.001
Thank you.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.836
Here's some marshmallows.
They're good.

20:38.838 --> 20:39.904
No, thank you.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.540
Agent Gibbs?

20:42.542 --> 20:43.908
We appreciate you
calling us.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.244
This has been
a very difficult time.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.578
But as...

20:47.580 --> 20:49.714
Friends of the family,

20:49.715 --> 20:51.849
we are honored to be
makaela's guardians now.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.485
The commander was
a very special man.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.587
He was like another father
to me, in many ways.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.923
We found these in your
grandfather's wallet.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.593
I think he'd want
you to have them.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.998
Makaela (Voice breaking):
I didn't know he kept this.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.934
Proud of his family.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.304
Proud of you.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.941
(Makaela sniffles)

21:16.943 --> 21:19.744
Everything he did,
he did for me or for my dad.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.982
Agent Gibbs,
can I have a moment?

21:28.621 --> 21:32.290
I think I should be the one
to tell Michael about his dad.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.425
You two close?

21:34.427 --> 21:35.660
(Scoffs)
We're like brothers.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.962
We served on
the<i> Saxon</i> together.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.531
We went through hell
together.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.866
Every time I'm in town,

21:41.868 --> 21:44.535
I still visit Michael,
once a month.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.671
He's one of
the best men I know.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.406
You think he's innocent?

21:50.910 --> 21:53.077
I don't think. I know.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.548
So tell me
about lieutenant swannie,

21:57.550 --> 21:59.550
your division officer.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.553
(Sighs) That son of a bitch
still gives me nightmares.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.088
His death?

22:04.090 --> 22:06.023
His life.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.459
He was a sick bastard
who wasn't fit to lead.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.660
We were just kids.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.828
He ruined us.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.697
Are you talking
about the hazing?

22:12.699 --> 22:13.798
That I could've dealt with.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.965
It was more...

22:14.967 --> 22:16.667
Psychological.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.602
He broke us.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.638
And he broke Bennett, too?

22:20.640 --> 22:23.007
There's only two ways to deal
with someone like swannie--

22:23.009 --> 22:24.642
either beat them, or join them.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.610
Bennett joined him.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.745
Commander Hayes
was a good man.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.548
A loving grandfather.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.882
All he wanted to know
was the truth,

22:31.884 --> 22:33.050
and look where it got him.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.652
Now makaela's father

22:34.654 --> 22:36.554
is in jail for a crime
he didn't commit,

22:36.556 --> 22:37.888
the old man is dead,

22:37.890 --> 22:39.623
and makaela suffers
all over again.

22:39.625 --> 22:40.958
(Phone ringing)

22:40.960 --> 22:42.793
I guess we don't always
get what we deserve, do we?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.830
Yeah, McGee,
what do you want?

22:45.832 --> 22:48.632
Boss, is there any way you can
come to the conference room?

22:48.634 --> 22:50.668
The sherlocks have uncovered
something that you should know.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.136
Are you talking
about commander Hayes?

22:52.138 --> 22:53.471
No, actually,

22:53.473 --> 22:54.705
his son, Michael.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.006
We think he might be innocent.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.544
(Sighs)
(Indistinct chatter)

23:00.546 --> 23:02.613
Gibbs, been out forever...

23:02.615 --> 23:03.948
Special agent Gibbs, we have...
Somebody talk to me.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.650
Other than her.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.552
Runyan Hayes's son, Michael,

23:08.554 --> 23:09.787
was convicted for murdering
his division officer

23:09.789 --> 23:11.922
and we think the forensic test

23:11.924 --> 23:14.592
that linked Michael
to the murder was flawed.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.726
Flawed how?

23:15.728 --> 23:16.961
Discredited, Gibbs.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.996
As in, it's no longer

23:18.998 --> 23:21.699
an accepted part
of the legal process.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.701
The murder happened in 1999,

23:23.703 --> 23:25.736
before DNA tests
became the standard.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.706
So when the hairs were found
on lieutenant swannie's body,

23:28.708 --> 23:30.124
a test called

23:30.125 --> 23:31.541
the microscopic
hair comparison analysis

23:31.544 --> 23:32.910
was performed.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.013
The test matched the hairs
to Michael Hayes.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.181
And?

23:37.183 --> 23:38.582
And that test couldn't match

23:38.584 --> 23:40.017
a pair of socks.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.452
Take a look at this report

23:41.454 --> 23:42.920
from the national academy
of sciences.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.890
It calls the hair test
"highly unreliable."

23:46.959 --> 23:48.959
And the FBI sent out
this press release,

23:48.961 --> 23:53.164
and it says that microscopic
hair analysis is bupkis.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.699
That's not technically
the quote, but...

23:55.701 --> 23:58.903
In the '80s and '90s, there were
more than 3,000 federal cases

23:58.905 --> 24:00.504
involving this hair analysis,

24:00.506 --> 24:02.540
and right now,

24:02.542 --> 24:05.476
the FBI is re-examining
every one of them.

24:05.478 --> 24:09.013
Yeah, and that means that
my buddy fornell will be busy.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.849
This is not our problem.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.586
No, Gibbs, it is our problem.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.889
The forensic scientist
who performed the test

24:18.891 --> 24:20.524
and testified
at Michael's trial...

24:21.928 --> 24:23.994
...was Abby Sciuto.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.510
I knew it. I knew it.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.011
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.480
Abbs...

24:42.482 --> 24:43.914
I knew this would happen.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.583
Ow.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.686
When I saw that press release,

24:48.688 --> 24:51.188
I went back and I found
12 cases where I used

24:51.190 --> 24:53.624
microscopic hair analysis.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.077
I sent them all to the FBI,

24:56.078 --> 24:58.529
and I've been waiting
and waiting and waiting
for the results.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.864
Take a look at this.
Tell me what you see?

24:59.866 --> 25:01.499
Uh...

25:01.501 --> 25:03.267
Two hairs, both brown.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.602
Actually, kind of gray.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.170
(Chuckles)

25:06.172 --> 25:08.639
Forensic scientists compare
ten different attributes

25:08.641 --> 25:10.841
of the hair, including color,

25:10.843 --> 25:13.177
the thickness,
the pigment distribution.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.912
I don't see any gray.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.213
I'd say they're identical.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.849
Wrong.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.151
The one on the left
is yours, Tony.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.053
The one on the right
is McGee's.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.122
How'd you get mine?

25:25.124 --> 25:27.525
I just got it off your jacket
when you first walked in.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.659
But that's not the point.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.294
The point is that
i should have known.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.162
Or I should have checked.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.298
Or I should have... something.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.233
Just put it out of your mind

25:36.235 --> 25:38.235
until the FBI finishes
doing their retesting.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.303
When will that be?

25:39.305 --> 25:40.170
Two weeks!

25:40.172 --> 25:41.805
I can't wait that long.

25:41.807 --> 25:44.275
I mean, this is my whole world.

25:44.277 --> 25:47.144
Can you imagine if I,
if I messed up?

25:47.146 --> 25:49.313
What that really means?

25:49.315 --> 25:51.682
It means that innocent people

25:51.684 --> 25:54.118
went to jail because of me.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.154
Because of my mistakes!

25:57.156 --> 25:59.223
<i> (Buzzer sounds)</i>

25:59.225 --> 26:01.292
(Indistinct chatter)

26:13.573 --> 26:14.972
Michael.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.607
What's wrong?

26:16.609 --> 26:18.008
Who is she, Jason?

26:18.010 --> 26:20.911
I'm so sorry, Michael.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.581
Man, what is this?

26:23.583 --> 26:25.849
Listen, I don't know
how to tell you this, okay,

26:25.851 --> 26:28.052
so I'm just going to say it.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.756
Your father's dead.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.992
Runyan was murdered.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.230
When?

26:40.232 --> 26:41.599
Hard to tell.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.233
About a week.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.136
They found him
in the woods.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.705
Bennett do this, too?

26:47.707 --> 26:50.107
I don't know, maybe.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.775
NCIS seems to think so.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.277
NCIS?

26:53.279 --> 26:56.246
They're helping us
now, Michael.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.948
Okay, th-th-they're
working with us.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.518
No, no.

27:00.519 --> 27:03.087
Michael, everybody's just
looking for the truth here.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.655
Is she one of them?

27:04.657 --> 27:05.923
Put her on the phone.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.291
Michael.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.360
Do it.

27:18.771 --> 27:19.970
Mr. Hayes,

27:19.972 --> 27:21.405
I'm special agent bishop.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.307
Now you listen to me.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.209
You stay away from my family.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.944
Stay away from my daughter.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.245
We're just trying to help.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.380
Oh, like you helped me

27:29.382 --> 27:31.098
back then?

27:31.099 --> 27:32.815
Like you listened to me
all those years ago?

27:32.818 --> 27:34.418
We're trying to find
your father's killer.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.786
Like you found

27:35.788 --> 27:37.855
lieutenant swannie's killer,
right?

27:37.857 --> 27:39.323
(Scoffs)

27:39.325 --> 27:42.226
Why don't you just blame me
for my father's murder?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.030
Look,

27:46.032 --> 27:47.998
um, agent bishop...

27:48.000 --> 27:49.767
Right?

27:49.769 --> 27:52.169
You want to help me?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.304
Let me hug my daughter.

27:54.306 --> 27:57.307
This glass, this phone.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.879
I haven't held her hand
in 16 years.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.417
I just want my baby back.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.788
Can... can NCIS help me do that?

28:14.794 --> 28:16.794
(Dramatic music playing)

28:16.796 --> 28:18.362
(Knocking at door)

28:18.364 --> 28:20.564
It's open!

28:20.565 --> 28:22.765
(Door creaks open)
Judith:
Special agent Gibbs.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.169
There is no Gibbs here.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.904
(Door closes)

28:26.906 --> 28:29.106
We just need three minutes
of your time.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.477
You got two.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.746
Nice place.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.415
Looks like one of those
make-believe houses

28:38.417 --> 28:40.451
that they used to nuke
in the desert in the '40s.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.286
Judith:
Mm, I like it.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.488
Just needs a woman's touch.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.989
You know,
you're a good sport.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.157
I know you don't want

28:47.159 --> 28:49.159
anything to do with me.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.161
Even though I could keep you

28:51.163 --> 28:54.198
like the triple-crown stud
that you are.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.499
How did you find my house?

28:55.501 --> 28:56.867
Walt:
Former p.D., remember?

28:56.869 --> 28:59.870
I could find a flea
on a rat's anus.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.240
Brought you a peace offering.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.374
Pegged you

29:04.376 --> 29:07.745
as a jerky guy
the second we met.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.047
Minute, 30.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.181
I'll get right to it.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.850
Look, we all
want the same thing here.

29:12.852 --> 29:16.053
Justice
for commander runyan Hayes,

29:16.055 --> 29:18.388
and now for his son,
Michael, too.

29:18.390 --> 29:21.024
We're asking NCIS
to consider

29:21.026 --> 29:24.962
formally reopening
the 1999 murder investigation.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.463
What's in the basement?

29:26.465 --> 29:28.031
Hey! None of your business.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.199
Come back here.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.201
Is it your naughty room?

29:31.203 --> 29:34.104
Want to know my safe word?

29:35.307 --> 29:37.407
Kielbasa.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.444
You know what
your problem is, Gibbs?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.546
Yeah, the three of you.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.447
The law.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.450
Got to abide by it, right?

29:46.452 --> 29:48.418
But the law can also

29:48.420 --> 29:51.054
be an impediment
for those people

29:51.056 --> 29:54.124
trying to uphold it.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.926
Makes things tough
to get done,

29:55.928 --> 29:57.795
if you know what I mean.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.429
40 seconds.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.966
The Sherlock consortium doesn't
need to play by the rules.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.535
How do you think
we got fireman

30:04.537 --> 30:06.503
Todd Bennett's divorce papers?

30:06.505 --> 30:09.506
He has a history of
domestic violence.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.509
My gut tells me
he killed commander Hayes.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.211
Okay, but he's got an alibi

30:14.213 --> 30:16.013
for the night
the commander died.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.182
Got 15 witnesses to back him up.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.951
Which is why you couldn't get
a warrant to search his house.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.555
But let's say we
search his house.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.390
Well, then I'd have
to arrest you.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.524
Team up with the sherlocks.

30:27.526 --> 30:28.926
What do you say?

30:28.928 --> 30:30.994
No.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.497
Well, you can think
about it.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.898
Hmm.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.569
(Sighs)
It's been really nice

30:38.571 --> 30:41.004
talking to you, sunshine.

30:41.006 --> 30:44.474
I hope we get
to do it again soon.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.577
Just the two of us.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.612
I'm asleep, right?

30:48.614 --> 30:51.915
This is a dream.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.986
Close your eyes

30:55.988 --> 30:58.222
and keep dreaming.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.623
It gets better

30:59.625 --> 31:01.892
and better.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.463
(Door opens)

31:06.465 --> 31:08.432
¶ ¶

31:08.434 --> 31:09.600
you happy now, bishop?

31:09.602 --> 31:11.535
(Scoffs)
Two unsolved murders,

31:11.537 --> 31:13.503
Abby's in hell,
I'm in pain,

31:13.505 --> 31:15.639
NCIS is teaming up with
a bunch of fruitcakes.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.241
It's armageddon.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.409
I didn't do this.
Ha!

31:19.411 --> 31:21.612
Well, the banana peel
didn't work this time.

31:21.614 --> 31:24.615
Abby says raisin enzymes
do the same thing.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.283
But the splinter's

31:26.285 --> 31:28.452
not coming out.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.620
No. No.

31:29.622 --> 31:32.089
You cannot blame me
for your finger, too.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.357
Yes, I can.
Absolutely, he can.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.626
(Sighs) Okay.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.962
I'm not saying
i believe in this voodoo stuff,

31:38.964 --> 31:41.899
because I don't.

31:41.901 --> 31:44.902
But if I did,

31:44.904 --> 31:46.637
is there something I could do
to reverse the curse?

31:46.639 --> 31:49.172
No. (Mouths)

31:49.174 --> 31:50.941
Well, there is one
thing she could do,

31:50.943 --> 31:52.376
but I don't think
she'd like it.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.077
No.
What?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.312
It's too awful.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.915
(Bell jingling)

32:00.085 --> 32:01.285
What do we got?

32:01.287 --> 32:02.419
We've got this.
Thanks.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.590
Okay, I give up.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.292
Tony:
It's a silicone impression

32:08.294 --> 32:10.027
of the hole in the tree made
by the mystery bullet

32:10.029 --> 32:11.061
that killed the commander.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.963
Mcmoldmaker and I

32:12.965 --> 32:14.932
grabbed it when we were
in the woods together.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.434
McGee: Abby was hoping to use
it to figure out striations,

32:17.436 --> 32:19.403
but these grooves
did not come from a bullet.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.605
They were made by a car key,
probably the only tool

32:21.607 --> 32:23.941
the killer could find to dig
the bullet out of the tree.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.109
And what kind of car does
that key fit?

32:26.111 --> 32:28.312
Impression wasn't clear enough
to pin down.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.180
But Abby made
a list of possibilities.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.115
Mostly trucks
and luxury vehicles.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.451
Why are you telling me this
and not Abby?

32:35.487 --> 32:37.287
Abby's not doing too well.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.989
She locked herself in her lab.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.524
Spent the night there
last night, boss.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.192
Yeah, she won't rest
until she finds out

32:42.194 --> 32:43.994
if Michael Hayes
is innocent.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.662
The FBI is handling that.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.397
Yeah, but it's gonna
take two weeks,

32:47.399 --> 32:49.032
so we can either
wait for the FBI,

32:49.034 --> 32:52.035
or we can do the DNA tests
ourselves, today.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.604
All we need
is Michael's DNA.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.373
Prison probably has
that record on file.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.109
How far is the prison
from here?

32:59.111 --> 33:00.143
Hour and a half.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.278
Start driving.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.980
I'll make the call.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.014
(Phone beeps)

33:04.016 --> 33:06.450
Gibbs:
Abbs!

33:06.452 --> 33:08.151
Found you.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.354
It's a... it's a little
cluttered in here.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.722
Ya think?

33:11.724 --> 33:14.091
I'm just...
Going over a few...

33:14.093 --> 33:16.326
Old cases.

33:16.328 --> 33:19.529
Actually, every case
I've ever worked on.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.731
Why?

33:20.733 --> 33:22.699
Triple checking all my work.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.401
It may take a few days.

33:24.403 --> 33:25.753
Days?

33:25.754 --> 33:27.104
(Sighs)
You want to talk about days?

33:27.106 --> 33:29.339
How about 5,953 days

33:29.341 --> 33:33.343
that Michael Hayes has been
sitting in prison because of me.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.345
Because of a flawed test.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.381
A flawed test that I conducted.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.383
It only matters that
you did your best.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.485
No... (Groans)

33:41.487 --> 33:45.422
Gibbs, no, that is what you say
to someone who fails.

33:45.424 --> 33:48.759
I mean, I know... I did my best.

33:48.761 --> 33:51.461
And I know that sometimes
mistakes are made.

33:51.463 --> 33:54.264
And I know Michael Hayes
might be guilty, anyway.

33:54.266 --> 33:57.200
But if I know all that, then...

33:57.202 --> 34:00.570
Why can't I... breathe?

34:00.572 --> 34:03.173
Come here.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.243
All right.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.444
Please...

34:07.446 --> 34:10.614
Gibbs, just... fix this.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.383
You always fix things.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.819
Please, fix this, too.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.554
I'm trying.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.628
I am trying, Abbs.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.565
(Indistinct background
radio communication)

34:28.567 --> 34:30.333
Tony:
NCIS.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.603
You here for the couple?
Bishop: Couple?

34:33.605 --> 34:35.172
What couple?

34:35.174 --> 34:37.574
Well, figure since you're
Navy agents, you heard.

34:38.544 --> 34:39.543
Michael Hayes's parents

34:39.545 --> 34:40.544
just came to visit.

34:40.546 --> 34:43.413
Mm... his mother
died years ago,

34:43.415 --> 34:45.182
and his father
just passed away.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.383
We know.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.451
That's why we detained them.

34:47.453 --> 34:48.785
Who are they?

34:48.787 --> 34:50.353
Won't talk.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.490
Only said they're
on a mission for NCIS.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.624
Bring in the couple.

34:54.626 --> 34:55.759
(Over radio): Copy that.
(Sighs)

34:55.761 --> 34:57.160
We searched them.

34:57.162 --> 34:59.129
Lady kind of liked it.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.397
Found a weapon.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.531
A weapon?

35:01.533 --> 35:03.333
Scissors--

35:03.334 --> 35:05.134
said they wanted
to give Hayes a haircut.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.236
Oh...
(Quiet chuckle)

35:06.238 --> 35:07.571
Like we'd ever
let them near him.

35:07.573 --> 35:08.605
(Lock buzzes, latch clicks)

35:08.607 --> 35:10.107
Oh, here they are now.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.544
(Sighs)

35:14.546 --> 35:16.813
So what do you want us
to do with these two?

35:26.859 --> 35:28.525
How could you?

35:28.527 --> 35:31.228
You jeopardized
our entire case.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.663
There are rules for a reason.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.632
A man's life is at stake here,

35:35.634 --> 35:39.236
not to mention the career of
a gifted forensic scientist

35:39.238 --> 35:41.404
who's now adrift in
a sea of self doubt.

35:41.406 --> 35:42.873
Sorry...
I'm sorry, Donald.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.508
Oh, please.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.710
You should have left them
to rot in jail.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.211
Ah, ease up on 'em, duck.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.147
They did the wrong thing
for the right reason.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.882
Well, don't you
go soft on me, now.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.683
Hey, just to be clear,

35:53.685 --> 35:55.352
you're yelling at them,

35:55.354 --> 35:58.155
and not me, right?

35:58.157 --> 36:00.290
Oh, shut up, Lyle.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.591
(Door closes)

36:01.593 --> 36:04.694
Donald's right,
we overstepped our boundaries.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.163
Mm-hmm.

36:06.165 --> 36:09.366
So why are you so calm,
agent Gibbs?

36:09.368 --> 36:12.402
They got Michael Hayes's DNA.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.937
Ms. Sciuto is, no doubt,

36:13.939 --> 36:17.174
running the new DNA test
on it right now.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.943
Walt, I will bet you were
one hell of a detective.

36:19.945 --> 36:21.912
Peanut butter...

36:21.914 --> 36:23.680
Peanut butter.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.183
What?

36:27.452 --> 36:29.553
Sorry.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.189
I noticed agents
DiNozzo and McGee

36:32.191 --> 36:34.724
uh, had tree sap
on their shoes,

36:34.726 --> 36:36.259
from their time
in the woods.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.962
Which is pretty
observant of me, right?

36:38.964 --> 36:41.248
So, anyway,

36:41.249 --> 36:43.533
i-i researched how to get sap
off of leather,

36:43.535 --> 36:45.936
and... it's peanut butter.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.737
It's the creamy kind,
not chunky.

36:47.739 --> 36:48.905
(Phone beeps)
Lyle...

36:48.907 --> 36:49.973
I know.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.692
Shut up?

36:51.693 --> 36:53.410
(Phone beeps)
No. You just solved a murder.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.744
Hey, DiNozzo,

36:54.746 --> 36:56.379
I need your finger.
Where are you?

36:56.381 --> 36:59.583
Did he just say
you solved a murder?

36:59.585 --> 37:03.286
Abbs.
Gibbs.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.454
It's not a match.
I know.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.289
(Sighs heavily)

37:06.291 --> 37:08.959
This is a perfectly
accurate DNA test.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.894
There's no way
it can be wrong.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.796
It's not a match
to the original hair.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.664
I know, I know.
Michael Hayes is innocent.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.216
What are we gonna do?

37:16.217 --> 37:17.767
I need you to focus.
We're gonna catch a killer.

37:17.769 --> 37:20.003
How?
If I give you
a sample of sawdust,

37:20.005 --> 37:22.272
could you match it
to a type of tree?

37:22.274 --> 37:23.273
Oh, yeah.

37:23.275 --> 37:24.808
I can do better than that.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.342
I can tell you the exact
tree that it came from.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.345
How?

37:28.346 --> 37:30.346
DNA, Gibbs, it's in
every living thing.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.348
(Computer blipping)

37:31.350 --> 37:33.683
Actually, DNA from a tree

37:33.685 --> 37:35.518
is very similar to human DNA.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.987
Good! That's great,
Abbs, great.

37:36.989 --> 37:39.689
Well, but I mean,
to get a match

37:39.691 --> 37:41.675
I would need
the sawdust,

37:41.676 --> 37:43.660
and I'd need a sample from
the tree that it came from.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.362
Uh... be back in five minutes.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.667
Boss cut me.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.269
Head slaps are one thing, but...

37:52.271 --> 37:54.371
Don't you think I've
suffered enough, bishop?

37:54.373 --> 37:56.039
You know what, bishop?

37:56.041 --> 37:57.674
You're the only one
that can fix this.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.675
Yeah...

37:58.677 --> 38:00.443
Okay.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.715
Attention, squad room.

38:05.717 --> 38:06.916
Louder!
Louder!

38:06.918 --> 38:10.020
(Loudly):
Attention, squad room!

38:11.356 --> 38:13.723
I, Eleanor bishop,

38:13.725 --> 38:16.926
am asking the spirits
of criminal science

38:16.928 --> 38:19.329
for a really hectic day.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.897
A-a crazy day, where

38:20.899 --> 38:24.401
lots of things go terribly,

38:24.403 --> 38:26.403
terribly wrong.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.437
There you go.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.406
Thank you.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.474
(Elevator bell dings)

38:32.044 --> 38:33.710
Never know, it might work.

38:33.712 --> 38:34.944
(Whispering):
Here comes our guy.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.446
Thanks.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.581
Jason:
Excuse me.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.083
Agent Gibbs asked me
to come in.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.051
Ah, yes, Mr. tupperman.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.385
He's expecting you.

38:42.387 --> 38:43.420
Hi, Jason. How are you?

38:43.422 --> 38:44.754
Oh.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.456
Would you like
a glass of water?

38:46.458 --> 38:47.857
Thank you.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.930
Perfect. Thank you.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.765
McGee: I noticed,
coming in this morning--

38:55.767 --> 38:57.600
it's pretty crowded out there.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.436
Did you find parking okay?

38:59.438 --> 39:00.470
Sure, yeah.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.505
No, I just used your valet.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.875
What is this?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.410
Hey, tupperman...

39:08.547 --> 39:11.414
...there is no valet.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.123
<i> Jason (Recorded): When they</i>
<i> arrested Michael, on the ship,</i>

39:20.125 --> 39:23.426
<i> in 1999, I wanted to confess</i>
<i> there and then.</i>

39:23.428 --> 39:26.730
And every day, I woke up,
i told myself

39:26.732 --> 39:28.131
I was gonna
tell the truth, but...

39:28.133 --> 39:31.801
I don't know, I just...
I couldn't do it.

39:31.803 --> 39:35.472
I do not regret killing
lieutenant swannie.

39:35.474 --> 39:39.442
But I do regret allowing my
best friend to take the fall.

39:39.444 --> 39:43.513
For 16 years, Michael and i
lived the wrong lives.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.465
(Recorder beeps off)

39:45.466 --> 39:47.416
So how did Gibbs come
to suspect tupperman?

39:47.419 --> 39:49.119
Tree sap.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.954
Yeah, when Gibbs noticed

39:50.956 --> 39:52.622
the dark stains
on tupperman's shoes,

39:52.624 --> 39:54.858
he didn't think
anything about it

39:54.860 --> 39:56.860
until Lyle, here,

39:56.862 --> 39:59.028
saw the same stains...

39:59.030 --> 40:01.598
On the shoes of agents
McGee and DiNozzo.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.400
It's circumstantial.

40:03.402 --> 40:07.904
Yes, until Ms. Sciuto
matched the sawdust

40:07.906 --> 40:10.440
in the teeth of
tupperman's car keys

40:10.442 --> 40:12.008
with the splinter...

40:12.010 --> 40:14.711
In agent DiNozzo's finger.

40:14.713 --> 40:17.514
DNA proved that they both came

40:17.516 --> 40:19.616
from the same
white eastern pine

40:19.618 --> 40:23.553
that stood directly behind
where the commander was shot.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.722
The witness tree...

40:25.724 --> 40:27.991
Did, in fact, testify.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.827
And fireman Bennett
had nothing to do with it?

40:30.829 --> 40:33.763
Oh, once a scapegoat,
always a scapegoat.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.502
Where's my Gibbs?

40:39.504 --> 40:41.504
He sends his regrets.

40:41.506 --> 40:42.505
Oh.

40:42.507 --> 40:43.873
Oh, it's fine.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.175
I'll be seeing
lots of him, anyway.

40:45.177 --> 40:48.545
Agent McGee and i
are collaborating

40:48.547 --> 40:50.046
on a new crime novel,

40:50.048 --> 40:51.714
and I'm basing
my main character

40:51.716 --> 40:55.752
on a silver-haired devil
short on words,

40:55.754 --> 40:58.555
but his eyes say plenty.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.622
(Chuckling)

40:59.624 --> 41:00.857
Heavens.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.892
Please, keep me out of it.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.794
Of course.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.630
And, uh...
Please accept my resignation.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.566
Donald! No!

41:09.568 --> 41:11.100
I'm sorry, Walter,

41:11.102 --> 41:12.869
the-the-the conflict
of interest

41:12.871 --> 41:14.504
weighs too heavily on me.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.905
I've made up my mind.

41:15.907 --> 41:19.476
But i-i understand,
from the house rules,

41:19.478 --> 41:20.977
I can name an apt replacement?

41:20.979 --> 41:22.712
Is that true?

41:22.714 --> 41:25.248
My house, my rules.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.934
Ducky:
So...

41:27.935 --> 41:30.619
I would like to pass
the magnifying glass to someone

41:30.622 --> 41:34.657
who I know shares
your unique enthusiasm.

41:35.694 --> 41:36.960
(Knocking "shave and a haircut")
Oh!

41:36.962 --> 41:38.161
There he is now!

41:39.498 --> 41:41.631
(Lock buzzing, latch clicking)

41:42.968 --> 41:44.567
Mr. James Palmer.

41:46.671 --> 41:47.937
Jimmy:
So sorry I'm late.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.606
I seem to have had a...

41:49.608 --> 41:52.108
An allergic reaction
to this wool cap.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.577
Do you have a cotton one?

41:56.715 --> 41:58.615
(Buzzer sounds, gate clicks)

41:58.617 --> 42:00.517
(Man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

42:00.519 --> 42:02.252
(Over P.A.):
Clear your racks,
clear the tiers.

42:02.254 --> 42:03.920
(Buzzer sounds)

42:03.922 --> 42:05.555
Guard (In distance):
Now! Right now!

42:11.162 --> 42:13.062
¶ ¶

42:20.572 --> 42:22.171
(gate squeaking)

42:24.709 --> 42:27.043
(Voice breaking):
Daddy!

42:27.045 --> 42:29.012
(Gate squeaks, clanks shut)

42:29.014 --> 42:30.079
(Keys rattling, lock clanking)

42:35.954 --> 42:39.122
¶ ¶

42:43.828 --> 42:45.662
thank you.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.764
Thank you both.

42:47.766 --> 42:50.600
I'm Abby Sciuto.

42:50.602 --> 42:52.669
I know who you are.

42:52.671 --> 42:54.337
I'm the one that
put you in here.

42:54.339 --> 42:55.905
No.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.142
You're the one who got me out.
