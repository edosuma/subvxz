WEBVTT

00:32.532 --> 00:34.743
It looks like it's down
to the final strike

00:34.826 --> 00:36.703
of the final out of the final inning.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.581
Is this where the Zephyrs'
perfect season ends?

00:40.457 --> 00:42.083
Wait for your pitch, Donna.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.757
Where's your rally cap, Dale?

00:48.840 --> 00:51.968
How's the rally god supposed to know
who to give mojo to?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.595
If we rally, I'll have to bat,

00:53.678 --> 00:57.265
and I'll be the last out
that ruins our undefeated season.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.226
Easy out.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.813
She's distracted by her recent divorce.

01:04.939 --> 01:05.815
Dang it, Dale.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.693
Shut up and put your glove
on your got-dang head.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.654
-Ow.
Got a walk. Walk's good, y' hear?

01:11.738 --> 01:12.906
-You're a saint, Donna.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.492
Okay, Dale, bases loaded. A hit wins it.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.869
But, but I haven't had a hit all season.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.163
Your season starts now, Dale.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.665
Take what you've learned
from all those strikeouts

01:22.749 --> 01:23.792
and put it to use.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.627
All you have to do is...

01:25.710 --> 01:27.962
"Believe to achieve."

01:28.046 --> 01:30.757
Now, get up there
and do what my shirt says.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.427


01:45.939 --> 01:47.315
Go foul, go foul, go foul.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.775
Run, Dale, run!

01:50.026 --> 01:50.860
Geh.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.376
Holy-moly, cannoli.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.503
Zephyrs win. Zephyrs win.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.051
Yeah, I spanked that ball so hard,

02:15.135 --> 02:18.429
I probably should've apologized
and bought it a box of chocolates.

02:18.596 --> 02:19.430
See, Dale?

02:19.514 --> 02:22.392
You believed, and then you achieved.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.146
I guess I believed a little,
but I don't know.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.398
I think there was
something more to it than that.

02:28.481 --> 02:32.652
Well, maybe you gave 110 percent,
because Hank says that works, too.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.904
No, I only gave 70 percent.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.364
I was feeling kind of sick

02:36.447 --> 02:39.117
after I accidentally swallowed
my chewing tobacco.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.162
Maybe you stumbled onto a lucky ritual.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.955
I mean, all the greats had one.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.374
Joe DiMaggio would keep a penny
in his shoe.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.126
Ty Cobb would beat his valet.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.379
Attention, Zephyrs.

02:51.713 --> 02:55.508
When the season started,
no one gave this team much of a chance

02:55.592 --> 02:59.304
and things looked pretty bleak
when we lost Joe Jack because of...

02:59.387 --> 03:02.640
Well, we all know what happened
at the Taco Bueno.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.186
But we never lost a step.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.979
Bob Jenkins joined the team,

03:08.062 --> 03:09.731
and to watch him in the outfield,

03:09.814 --> 03:13.067
you would've thought there was radar
under that eye patch.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.779
And through it all,
none of us stopped believing,

03:16.863 --> 03:20.533
and that's why we're the first
undefeated softball team

03:20.617 --> 03:22.285
in Arlen Rec League history.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.162
Yeah.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.873
Real stirring, Hank.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.709
Listen, how'd you like to give
a motivational talk at school tomorrow?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.753
Really? I'd be honored.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.005
Thanks. The magician had to cancel.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.132
Who would've thought
a dove could do all that

03:36.216 --> 03:37.425
to a man's face?

03:39.844 --> 03:42.972
And so whether
you eventually choose a career

03:43.056 --> 03:45.475
in customer service or the military,

03:45.558 --> 03:48.770
try to do it the Zephyr way, perfect.

03:48.978 --> 03:52.649
Now, if I could have all the members
of the baseball team, please stand,

03:52.732 --> 03:55.944
I'd like to tell you a little story
about never giving up.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.030
Uh, the baseball program's been cut, Hank.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.281
Budget issues.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.699
Go, Longhorns.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.326
Well, this is just wrong.

04:03.409 --> 04:07.205
Okay, if you were on the baseball team,
I've got a message for you.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.582
Keep believing in yourselves.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.794
How's that gonna bring
our baseball team back?

04:15.129 --> 04:19.008
Well, uh, it's, uh, uh...

04:20.051 --> 04:21.052
Hah.

04:25.890 --> 04:29.018
There's got to be some way
to save the baseball program.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.145
Hmm. Well, let's see.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.399
You could attract new industry to Arlen
and raise the tax base.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.818
Hank, you'd be great
at attracting industry.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.112
Yeah, but that could take months.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.406
Baseball season starts next week.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.910
Hank, I've got it.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.579
We could play the Ace of Diamonds
and His Jewels.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.039
They take on local teams

04:50.123 --> 04:53.334
and use their crazy antics
to raise money for charity.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.961
<i>Look at the Ace.</i>

04:55.044 --> 04:57.964
<i>He's parked the unicycle
and now, he's on stilts.</i>

04:58.047 --> 05:03.720
<i>Yup, I used these when I played
for the San Francisco Jolly Green Giants.</i>

05:04.929 --> 05:08.016
<i>Now the Ace has ditched his stilts
and he's pitching from the outfield.</i>

05:09.183 --> 05:12.478
<i>Even pitching from the outfield,
Ace is still throwing smoke.</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:15.023
They say he used his fastball
to stun a bear

05:15.106 --> 05:16.691
to keep it from mauling a little girl.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.943
<i>Folks, looks like the Ace
has finally lost it.</i>

05:19.027 --> 05:20.737
<i>He's walked the bases loaded.</i>

05:21.154 --> 05:23.906
<i>Well, I'm in quite a pickle here.</i>

05:23.990 --> 05:26.492
<i>I might as well have a sandwich with it.</i>

05:27.452 --> 05:28.703
I hear on some mounds

05:28.786 --> 05:31.080
that are wired for it,
he makes a Denver omelet.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.626
<i>Here's the pitch.
And a line drive right at the Ace.</i>

05:35.710 --> 05:37.587
<i>He steps on the bag, tags the runner.</i>

05:37.670 --> 05:39.714
<i>It's an unassisted triple play.</i>

05:41.132 --> 05:44.469
<i>And as the winner of the game,
the Ace gets the prize money.</i>

05:44.552 --> 05:48.973
<i>Wait. Oh, my God, he's, he's giving it
to the Abilene Spay and Neuter Foundation.</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:51.934
<i>-Unbelievable.</i>
-<i>Unbelievable?</i>

05:52.018 --> 05:54.270
<i>Not for softball's number one
philanthropist.</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:58.399
<i>The Ace always gives
the winner's check to charity.</i>

05:58.900 --> 05:59.984
Peggy?

06:00.068 --> 06:03.654
Tom Landry Middle School
is gonna be on that tape someday.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.454
I wonder if cows really get
how good they taste.

06:11.746 --> 06:15.249
Here it is, team,
our league championship trophy.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.088
Uh. Wait a minute.
There's a mistake.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.174
Right down here, what it should say is,

06:23.257 --> 06:24.509
"To be continued."

06:25.259 --> 06:27.845
That's right,
our dream season isn't over.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.682
We are going to play
the Ace of Diamonds and his Jewels.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.684
Oh, man, you're talking
about ol' Ace of Diamonds.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.604
Man, they got dang invited
to dang White House, man.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.689
One of them struck out
Marlin Fitzwater, man.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.692
Now, the Ace and his team
keep 10 percent of the gate,

06:41.776 --> 06:45.029
but the winner gives the rest
to Tom Landry Middle School

06:45.113 --> 06:46.823
to save the baseball program.

06:47.073 --> 06:47.990
We can bill it

06:48.074 --> 06:50.076
as the Battle of the Unbeatens.

06:50.159 --> 06:55.081
The 11-0 Zephyrs
against the Ace's 239-game win streak.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.749
239?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.545
Well, we couldn't stay undefeated forever.

07:01.003 --> 07:05.550
"Fame is but a slow decay.
Even this shall pass away."

07:05.633 --> 07:08.219
I guess it'll be okay,
'cause when it's over,

07:08.302 --> 07:10.596
he'll hand a giant check
to those poor kids.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.514
Wait a second.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.100
Don't give up
before we even hit the field.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.852
I think we can be the winners.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.062
We can be the ones
handing over that check.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.773
But, Hank, aren't we supposed
to just let him beat us?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.108
That's the fun of it, right?

07:22.191 --> 07:24.318
All the pranks and all the tricks
the Ace does.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.363
You think former big leaguers
like the Ace and his Jewels

07:27.447 --> 07:29.365
enjoy having to play like that.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.368
It's like playing basketball
with an eight-year-old kid.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.996
You shoot with your left hand
just to keep it interesting.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.081
Hey. Maybe you're right, Hank.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.166
You bet I'm right.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.625
They want to be challenged.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.628
They're dying for someone
to give them an actual game.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.046
What a thrilling idea.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.424
Davids, pick up your slingshots.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.426
We're going to slay the Ace.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.220
Well, Bob, I didn't expect
that kind of spirit out of you,

07:51.304 --> 07:53.264
but by God, it is appreciated.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.611
Boy, this Ace of Diamonds highlight video
is really something.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.322
It's like he did
all of our scouting for us.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.116
The Ace picked him off,
throwing behind his back.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.743
They're going to kill us.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.161
Calm down, guys.

08:15.244 --> 08:18.706
See how much his velocity drops
when he pitches on stilts?

08:18.789 --> 08:21.876
And remember, there's only
two jewels in the field.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.920
A catcher and a first baseman.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.297
Leaving their outfield very vulnerable.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.383
Arrogance, it's their fatal flaw.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.928
All we have to do
is hit it where they ain't.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.727
We're gonna play good D
and lots of small ball,

08:39.810 --> 08:42.813
and we're gonna win
because the whole season, we did what?

08:42.897 --> 08:44.857
Believed to achieve.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.527
Hey, I believe, Hank.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.569
We'll win

08:48.653 --> 08:52.406
because our Lord Jesus Christ
chose us to win.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.827
Uh... okay, Enrique.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.758
Make sure you say these tickets
are to help the baseball team.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.886
Boomhauer, cover Tom McCann
to the LensCrafters.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.388
Dale, you take the food court.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.974
Bill, go anywhere but Victoria's Secret.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.853
Do you think I'd sell more tickets...

09:22.937 --> 09:25.147
...as a French boy?

09:28.943 --> 09:31.529
Would you be interested
in some exciting family,

09:31.612 --> 09:33.447
or blended family, entertainment?

09:33.531 --> 09:36.200
Wow. The Ace of Diamonds
and his Jewels?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.618
And the Zephyrs.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.371
Daddy saw the Ace play in Kerrville
when I was your age.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.622
I got to stand on home plate

09:41.706 --> 09:43.374
and have the Ace knock a peanut
off my head.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.584
-Cool.
-Awesome.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.045
Hey, how much do you think
they'll beat you by? Ten? Fifteen?

09:48.504 --> 09:51.549
Hold on. I'm not so sure
we're gonna get beat.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.800
We're in it to win.

09:52.883 --> 09:56.262
Yeah, and I suppose your fastball
can stun a bear, too.

10:01.892 --> 10:05.855
Now, when Sports Jock and Chad put me on,
make sure to turn the radio down.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.357
I don't want to be one
of those guys they scold.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.067
<i>All right, everyone, new topic.</i>

10:10.151 --> 10:11.819
<i>the Ace of Diamonds and his Jewels.</i>

10:11.902 --> 10:13.571
<i>They're in town tonight
to strut their stuff</i>

10:13.654 --> 10:14.822
<i>against the Arlen Zephyrs.</i>

10:14.905 --> 10:17.658
<i>We've got Zephyrs Player
Coach Hank Hill with us.</i>

10:17.742 --> 10:21.954
<i>Now, Hank, I have never seen
this much interest in a softball game.</i>

10:22.038 --> 10:26.042
Yep. It's gonna be a big victory
for underdogs everywhere if we win.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.169
Uh, sorry. I mean, when we win.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.587
<i>Listen to you woof.</i>

10:29.670 --> 10:32.006
<i>I'm gonna have to put you
in the Sports Jock dog pound.</i>

10:34.008 --> 10:36.177
<i>I like your showmanship, Hank.</i>

10:36.260 --> 10:37.428
I'll let you out.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.689
Welcome,
everyone, to the greatest show on cleats.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.233
And a special welcome
to tonight's charity,

10:51.317 --> 10:54.320
the Tom Landry Middle School
baseball team.

10:55.112 --> 10:59.158
And how about a big Arlen welcome
to the clown princes of softball,

10:59.241 --> 11:01.869
the Ace and his Jewels.

11:02.244 --> 11:06.332
And to the local undefeated
Arlen Zephyrs, we say good luck.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.709
Dale, remember your ritual.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.426
All right, it's show time.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.220
Little tip, when I strike you out,

11:19.303 --> 11:21.430
take a step like you're
gonna charge the mound,

11:21.514 --> 11:22.848
and I'll stare you down.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.351
I've gotten digits from the ladies
in the upper deck

11:25.434 --> 11:27.103
when I break this out.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.066
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Ace and his Jewels.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.069
It always amazes me
how three can defeat ten.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.488
I bet his first pitch
is gonna be on stilts.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.240
No, no. On his knees.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.995
Evening. I'm the Ace.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.832
And I'll be your tour guide
on a magical trip

11:47.915 --> 11:51.460
around this 12-inch world I call softball.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.964
First up for the Zephyrs, Hank Hill.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.258
Ready?

11:58.384 --> 11:59.927
All aboard.

12:00.010 --> 12:03.431
The Ace pitches,
and Hill bunts... to third base.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.519
-And he makes it to first safely.
-Yeah.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.279
This is where I pitch by smell.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.991
Luckily, my catcher
hasn't changed his socks all week.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.493
Somebody please get him
a new pair of socks.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.082
Okay, Boomhauer,

12:30.166 --> 12:31.041
bring me home.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.961
Repeat: Bring me home.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.465
Watch out.
The Ace is pitching blindly.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.092
And the Zephyrs bunt to third base.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.097
-Daddy, make it be fun.
-I ain't your daddy.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.974
Oh, you're talking to him.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.185
-What happened?
-They bunted again.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.646
Good Lord. That's a live ball.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.024
No one's ever bunted before.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.194
It looks like the Zephyrs
are taking advantage

12:58.277 --> 13:00.738
of the Ace's confusion, and they score.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.575
You were right, Hank.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.202
Maybe we can do this.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.080
What are these jackasses doing?

13:10.164 --> 13:11.415
Don't worry, Boomhauer.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.918
I will bring you home.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.254
He's gonna bunt again?

13:17.671 --> 13:20.466
All right, show's over.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.307
Here it comes, fat man.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.478
Stee-rike.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.655
And the Ace
has shut down the Zephyrs.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.493
Okay, folks, now it's fun time.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.161
The Ace is up to bat.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.454
All right.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.414
And now the pitch.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.377
Nice home run.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.255
Not funny, but it went far.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.571
Well, it looks like
we made it to the end,

14:23.654 --> 14:27.116
with the Ace 63 and the Zephyrs one.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.870
Thank God, it's finally over.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.497
Of course, there will always
be the nightmares.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.251
Now, we may have lost
our undefeated season,

14:37.334 --> 14:40.170
but we gave those kids
their baseball program back.

14:40.254 --> 14:43.549
And no defeat, no matter how, uh...

14:44.174 --> 14:46.969
-thorough... can change that.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.805
Those of you who are left,
how about that game?

14:50.264 --> 14:52.892
You certainly saw something
you can go home and reflect upon.

14:53.475 --> 14:58.397
Anyhow, I hereby present this check
to the winner, the Ace of Diamonds.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.279
Hey, wait. Uh, where you going, Ace?

15:05.362 --> 15:07.281
You're supposed to give
that money to the kids.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.407
Isn't that the deal?

15:08.490 --> 15:12.995
Well, if they play anything like you guys,
they are better off without it.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.096
<i>The real losers
Saturday night were the fans.</i>

15:31.180 --> 15:32.139
<i>What a travesty.</i>

15:32.222 --> 15:34.350
<i>People took their families there
to have some fun,</i>

15:34.433 --> 15:35.309
<i>and what did they see?</i>

15:35.392 --> 15:38.479
<i>Hank Hill bunting and the Ace
taking batting practice.</i>

15:38.562 --> 15:39.855
<i>It was ugly all right.</i>

15:39.939 --> 15:42.441
<i>I put this one in Chad's
softball hall of shame.</i>

15:42.524 --> 15:43.442
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

15:47.237 --> 15:50.741
Why'd we ever think we could take
on the Ace and his Jewels?

15:50.824 --> 15:53.953
Hank got me so fired up,
I was willing to believe in anything...

15:54.203 --> 15:55.204
even myself.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.707
I guess I got a bit carried away.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.795
I've got to straighten this out
and get those kids their money back.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.258
Bill, if it's any consolation,
I never believed in you.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.807
Hello, this is Hank Hill,
and I coach the Zephyrs.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.726
Yes, those Zephyrs.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.354
Listen, do you know
where the Ace is playing tonight?

16:21.021 --> 16:23.691
No, I don't want to buy
a commemorative tour schedule.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.859
Couldn't you just tell me
the name of the town?

16:28.612 --> 16:29.697
It's a Visa.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.704


16:40.332 --> 16:41.542
Oh, look.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.210
It's the Bunt Brothers.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.296
Look, we're real sorry
about spoiling the fun.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.675
We just wanted to give you a real game,
you know, show some pride.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.845
I'm sure you can understand that
as a fellow athlete.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.680
Fellow athlete?

16:54.763 --> 16:58.100
I got my picture on some of that gum
that looks like tobacco.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.226
How about you?

16:59.309 --> 17:00.769
All right, I get it.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.396
But let's just think about the kids.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.940
You always give
the winner's check to charity.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.027
Yeah. And I always clear
a few grand in merchandise

17:08.110 --> 17:10.279
and score a little overnight company.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.699
But thanks to your boring little stunt,
the Ace slept alone last night

17:13.782 --> 17:16.285
and has an RV full of unsold bobbleheads.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.371
You know what that's like
when I go over a railroad crossing?

17:19.455 --> 17:21.415
Okay, I admit, I screwed up,

17:21.498 --> 17:23.959
but that's no reason to take it out
on a bunch of kids.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.669
Just give us another shot.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.338
We'll take foolhardy leads off first,

17:28.422 --> 17:30.799
we'll swing at bad pitches,
whatever's funny.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.303
Hmm. I'm a nice guy.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.890
Maybe if you ask me in baby talk.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.310
Well, I don't see how
that could make a difference...

17:45.147 --> 17:46.356
Oh, God.

17:46.857 --> 17:52.446
Uh, can we, uh, pwease
have another shot, pwease?

17:52.946 --> 17:55.032
Hmm... maybe.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.534
Do you know what you did wrong?

17:57.618 --> 18:02.998
Uh... maybe we pwayed too sewiouswy.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.292
Well, let me think about it.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.420
No.

18:11.215 --> 18:15.552
I'm sorry, baby. The spiced wine
should be hot enough by now.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.597
How about you?

18:23.435 --> 18:26.980
Listen. This isn't about you and me.
This is for the kids.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.315
We had a deal.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.692
So, a parking lot attendant.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.195
You ever parked one of these babies?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.573
He can't just hide in that damn RV
and ignore us.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.574
Yes, he can.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.952
And when he gets bored,
he can just drive away.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.161
Well, I'm not gonna let him.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.705
Save your breath, Hank.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.749
The only thing
that could get him out of there

18:45.833 --> 18:48.710
is a twister, the RV's only predator.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.965
Hope is a vessel
dashed upon the rocks of...

18:53.048 --> 18:54.591
Oh, what's the point?

18:54.675 --> 18:57.052
Wait. I know who can send us a twister.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.680
And with the help from our...

19:00.347 --> 19:02.015
Oh, what's the point?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.236
We're not giving up.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.238
We just need to reach down deep

19:16.321 --> 19:19.116
and grab what's already
in each and every one of us.

19:19.199 --> 19:22.286
We've got grit, guts and determination,

19:22.369 --> 19:25.038
and we're gonna use them
to rock this damn RV

19:25.122 --> 19:26.623
until he comes running out of it.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.250
Now, let's do this, Zephyrs.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.919
Uh-oh. The hair on my back
is starting to tingle.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.172
Your hair knows something
you're about to find out.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.924
We're getting those kids their money.
Now, come on, Bill.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.551
Put your weight in that fender.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.682
It really moved.

19:43.765 --> 19:46.977
Everyone, grab some aluminum.
Donna, take that wheel well.

19:47.060 --> 19:50.022
Enrique, put your shoulder into it.
Come on, go, go.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.524
Ready, set, rock.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.986
Believe to achieve.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.155
Believe to achieve.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.325
Believe to achieve.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.078
Wha, what the...

20:07.539 --> 20:10.959
Hey. Hey, stop it. I'm entertaining.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.379
You know, Ace, we can do this
in every town you play in.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.382
I bought a commemorative tour schedule
from your wife.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.134
Your wife?

20:21.428 --> 20:22.888
So where are we going tomorrow night?

20:22.971 --> 20:26.350
Denton, then Fredericksburg,
then into Rumpert.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.063
Why bother even putting on cologne?

20:31.271 --> 20:32.522
Okay, okay.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.815
Take the check.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.193
Just stop pushing my house.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.740
Way to go, team.

20:41.949 --> 20:47.663
Well, I guess that makes the final score
Zephyrs one, Ace's house zero.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.546
Well, those new uniforms
look pretty good, I tell you what.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.049
Maybe next year
we can raise even more money

20:59.132 --> 21:01.510
and get them fur coats and top hats.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.390
Ah, fundamentals.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.474
-<i>I ain't your daddy.</i>
