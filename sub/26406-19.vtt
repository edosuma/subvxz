I'm right, so whatever.

- Sandra! Got you!

08:10.311 --> 08:13.042
[LAUGHING] Got you! Oh yeah!

08:13.043 --> 08:16.049
Yeah, I was waiting for you for hours!

08:16.117 --> 08:17.350
Yeah.

08:17.419 --> 08:19.619
- Oh, that was fun.
- Can I get you...

08:19.687 --> 08:22.221
- Help you out?
- Oh, thank you.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.656

[GRUNTING]

08:29.064 --> 08:30.997
Hey, is this your kid?

08:31.066 --> 08:34.133
No. I mean, yes.

08:34.202 --> 08:36.534
Eh, you already said no. Beat it.

08:37.539 --> 08:38.830
So what's your deal?
You waiting for someone

08:38.831 --> 08:40.173
to buy you liquor or something?

08:40.241 --> 08:43.308
No, I'm waiting for my mom.
She works here.

08:43.378 --> 08:45.178
- Who's your mom?
- Janet Woods.

08:45.677 --> 08:47.980
You didn't hear?
She died, like, a month ago.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.030
- What?
- Woods!

08:50.485 --> 08:53.487
Sorry, I was thinking Rogers.
No, no, your mom's not dead.

08:53.488 --> 08:55.808
She's very alive. Cool science kit.

08:55.809 --> 08:56.589
Thanks?

08:56.658 --> 08:58.191
I'm sorry you're not
going to be able to go

08:58.259 --> 08:59.659
to that STEM science program thing.

08:59.727 --> 09:01.694
It's just a tough economy
right now, you know?

09:02.287 --> 09:04.864
Wait, I can't go to the program?

09:06.215 --> 09:08.572
I don't know. I mean, maybe, maybe not.

09:08.574 --> 09:09.495
You should talk to your mom.

09:09.496 --> 09:11.706
I mean, she... she knows
you better than I do.

09:12.342 --> 09:15.811
Oh, you're really Droopy Dog
about this, aren't you?

Whoa!

Hey, Mateo.

09:37.259 --> 09:38.567
What are you doing here?

09:38.635 --> 09:42.571
Oh, just got, uh, sent home early.

09:44.174 --> 09:45.618
Are you living here?

09:46.009 --> 09:49.144
What, like some homeless person?

09:49.213 --> 09:51.313
[GIGGLING] No, no! God, no.

09:51.381 --> 09:52.414
I...

09:52.483 --> 09:53.568
I... I sleep here.

09:54.097 --> 09:55.567
I live in my car.

09:56.286 --> 09:57.819
Oh.

09:58.835 --> 10:00.569
I want to get her
something really special.

10:01.372 --> 10:02.298
They don't know if she'll make it

10:02.340 --> 10:03.605
through the surgery, so this could be

10:03.607 --> 10:05.733
our last Mother's Day together, and I...

10:15.991 --> 10:18.136
Please don't tell anyone.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.483
I... I'd offer to give you money, but...

10:22.714 --> 10:23.678
It's okay.

10:25.801 --> 10:26.934
Well, I'm just gonna...

Hey, wait, wait! No, wait.

Uh, why don't you just stay
and hang out?

10:30.005 --> 10:31.227
Do you like sushi?

10:31.907 --> 10:34.140
'Cause I make a mean shrimp ramen.

10:34.209 --> 10:36.042
[CHUCKLES] That's not sushi.

Um, you know, I'm actually trying to...

10:39.131 --> 10:40.183
Please stay.

10:43.177 --> 10:45.018
Hey boss, quick question.

10:45.087 --> 10:46.987
Do we have any wiggle room on hours?

10:47.055 --> 10:50.357
Uh, well, I don't know.
You made the schedule!

10:50.425 --> 10:51.451
Ha-ha. Yeah.

10:51.994 --> 10:54.260
I was just hoping to give
a few extra to Janet.

10:54.329 --> 10:55.996
Just met her son... cute kid...

10:56.064 --> 10:58.662
and I, uh, feel kind of bad.

10:59.413 --> 11:01.401
Yeah, I mean, I wish we could,

11:01.470 --> 11:04.137
but they were really strict
about cutbacks,

11:04.206 --> 11:05.905
and if we give her more,
we're gonna have

11:05.974 --> 11:07.306
to take them from someone else

11:07.375 --> 11:09.541
and then that's just gonna
start a whole thing, so...

11:09.610 --> 11:11.576
Mm-hmm, yeah. No, absolutely.

11:11.645 --> 11:13.178
I get it. Don't even worry about it.

11:13.247 --> 11:16.181
I was, uh, just wanting to ask.

11:16.783 --> 11:19.284
- You okay?
- You know what's funny?

11:19.353 --> 11:22.087
I've, uh, never had a problem
hearing people's sob stories.

11:22.156 --> 11:23.822
It's, like, that's just words,

11:23.891 --> 11:25.770
but when you... when you see them,

11:26.492 --> 11:28.417
the people actually hurting,

11:29.335 --> 11:30.829
it's, uh... it's kind of a bummer.

11:31.181 --> 11:33.098
Yeah, um...

11:33.608 --> 11:36.001
Look, Dina, if this
is all just too much,

11:36.070 --> 11:37.169
we could just stop telling people

11:37.238 --> 11:38.537
that you made the schedule.

11:38.605 --> 11:39.409
Yeah?

11:39.410 --> 11:41.706
'Cause if it's all the same
to you, maybe we should.

11:41.775 --> 11:44.576
Y... yeah. Although, you know, I mean,

11:44.645 --> 11:46.206
I would hate for people to think

11:46.207 --> 11:47.612
that I demoted you.

11:47.681 --> 11:48.880
- They wouldn't.
- They might.

11:48.949 --> 11:50.015
Oh, it wouldn't bother me if they did.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.016
Yeah, but you also thought

11:51.084 --> 11:52.684
this wouldn't bother you,

11:53.406 --> 11:54.986
and now we're here, so...

11:55.889 --> 11:56.773
Yeah.

11:57.791 --> 12:00.979
You're probably right.
Well, back out there.

12:03.053 --> 12:04.429
[SOFTLY] I mean, I guess I could...

12:04.497 --> 12:05.477
- Huh?
- Huh?

12:05.933 --> 12:08.499
I didn't say anything. Um, pipes.

12:08.569 --> 12:09.261
Oh.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.003
- Bye.
- What?

12:12.072 --> 12:14.138
Just bye. I was just saying bye.

12:14.207 --> 12:15.636
Oh. Bye.

12:18.644 --> 12:20.611
First the baby wipes were in Baby,

12:20.680 --> 12:21.812
then they moved them to Pharmacy,

12:21.881 --> 12:23.620
and now they're back in Baby again.

12:23.983 --> 12:26.149
Uh, isn't the Baby section that way?

12:26.218 --> 12:28.052
Yeah, but we're taking the long way.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.720

over there

12:29.789 --> 12:30.957

12:30.958 --> 12:32.550
Oh. Okay.

12:34.794 --> 12:36.860
It's awful. I've been telling everyone

12:36.929 --> 12:38.195
that Dina's the one
who made the schedule,

12:38.263 --> 12:40.698
and she says that she's fine with it,

12:40.766 --> 12:42.165
but I feel weird.
What are you looking at?

12:42.234 --> 12:43.500
Nothing. I'm listening. Keep going.

12:43.569 --> 12:45.202
[SIGHS] It just feels
like I'm asking her

12:45.270 --> 12:47.071
to take the blame for something I did,

12:47.139 --> 12:48.672
although, you know, it's not my fault

12:48.741 --> 12:50.340
corporate decided to cut the payroll.

12:50.409 --> 12:52.675
- Hmm, hmm! Hmm!
- Jonah, what are you doing?

12:52.744 --> 12:54.677
Just hugging you. Hugging you tightly.

12:54.746 --> 12:56.178
Okay, well, thank you.

12:56.247 --> 12:57.413
Thanks. I feel better now.

12:57.482 --> 12:59.415
- You can stop.
- Hmm, oh, you know what?

12:59.484 --> 13:01.150
Have you seen
the new SodaStream display?

13:01.219 --> 13:03.552
Jonah, what are you doing? I can walk!

13:03.622 --> 13:04.821
Jonah, put me down!

13:04.889 --> 13:07.356
It's just not a good time for me.

13:07.425 --> 13:09.826
My husband just got
laid off from his job,

13:09.894 --> 13:12.528
and the bank wants to
foreclose on our house.

13:12.597 --> 13:13.630
Yeah, yup, yup.

13:14.833 --> 13:15.965
and I know it's going
to be triplets again.

13:16.034 --> 13:17.500
Don't care. Can't help you.

13:17.568 --> 13:18.635
I make the schedule.

13:18.703 --> 13:20.269
Do you want to see a picture of my dog?

13:20.338 --> 13:21.090
Mm-mm!

He's very sick

13:22.607 --> 13:23.740
and he has alopecia.

13:23.808 --> 13:26.174
No, shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

13:26.727 --> 13:28.926
Oh! Oh, he's so ugly.

13:29.412 --> 13:31.212
Oh, you should put him
out of his misery.

- No!
- That's no way to live.

13:35.385 --> 13:36.618
Mmm. Mmm.

13:36.687 --> 13:38.219
Sorry it's so crunchy.

13:38.288 --> 13:39.888
I can't get water to boil down here,

13:39.957 --> 13:41.857
so it just comes out a little Al dente.

13:41.924 --> 13:42.930
That's fine.

13:44.094 --> 13:46.094
God, out of all the people
that work here,

13:46.163 --> 13:47.796
I can't believe I'm the homeless one.

It's so embarrassing.

It ain't easy.
You would crack in a day.

14:00.660 --> 14:03.054

needlessly antagonistic.

It's true. You couldn't handle it.

Always worrying
if you're gonna get caught,

14:07.267 --> 14:09.468
wondering what people
would think if they knew.

14:09.536 --> 14:11.103
Oh, I think I could handle it.

14:11.171 --> 14:13.405
Come on. Your cushy little life?

14:13.474 --> 14:15.648
You don't know my life,
and it's not that cushy.

about my thing.

Glenn, Glenn, no, no, no, no.

15:42.755 --> 15:45.156
It's just that if I lose my hours,

15:45.157 --> 15:48.482
I can't afford my arthritis medication,

15:48.483 --> 15:50.916
and without my arthritis medication,

15:50.917 --> 15:55.094
I can't open the bottle
for my heart medication,

15:55.095 --> 15:58.349

Fine, I'll give you both
more hours, okay?

Uh, Dina? Uh, you're just

16:12.090 --> 16:13.621
giving people their hours back?

You are? Can I get mine back too?

- Sure, what the hell?
- No, I don't think she...

16:16.959 --> 16:18.428
Thank you! Thank you.

16:18.940 --> 16:22.215
Oh, you're just giving them
out left and right, huh?

16:22.216 --> 16:23.552
You're like Oprah,

to think things through.

16:26.045 --> 16:27.476
- I'll take some hours.
- Done.

- Hey Dina...
- Now go put down your dog.

sure you're not promising hours

some hours, huh?
