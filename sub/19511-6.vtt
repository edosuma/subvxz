00:03.267 --> 00:04.833
My dad, he was
twofaced, too.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.200
He shot himself.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.933
That story about
your father...

00:08.000 --> 00:08.967
truth or no?

00:09.033 --> 00:10.100
No.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.367
Yo, what you want me
to do with her?

00:13.433 --> 00:14.900
Let her go.
The fuck you mean?

00:14.967 --> 00:15.900
Let her go!

00:15.967 --> 00:17.100
Run, bitch!

00:18.500 --> 00:20.767
Multiple eyewitnesses
says your client,

00:20.833 --> 00:22.333
Rex Boogie, fired the gun,

00:22.400 --> 00:24.400
inciting the stampede
that left four dead.

00:24.467 --> 00:25.833
They killed my boy.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.333
David's gone.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.667
Last Friday at
the Whitman Ballroom,

00:29.733 --> 00:33.067
I was... fooling around
with my gun,

00:33.133 --> 00:34.267
and I-- I shot
it in the air.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.600
Nikki, Nikki, Nikki!

00:36.667 --> 00:37.900
It's the "Village Voice."

00:37.967 --> 00:39.067
I thought Damita was
your homey.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.200
I didn't know
she was gonna be

00:40.267 --> 00:42.400
a backstabbing
little bitch.

00:42.467 --> 00:43.533
Yo, Damita,
let me holler at you.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.733
Yeah, what do you--

00:46.200 --> 00:48.133
Did we really meet at
the New Music Seminar?

00:48.200 --> 00:49.500
No.
You're fired.

01:27.567 --> 01:29.300
I'm just calling it
like I see it.

01:29.367 --> 01:30.633
Don't shoot
the messenger.

01:31.933 --> 01:34.500
Excuse me if I'm happy
to have my one and only baby

01:34.567 --> 01:37.267
back home, instead of that
hellhole of a city

01:37.333 --> 01:39.533
that took her
father and her boyfriend.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.067
Back is fine.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.067
But what is she
gonna do?

01:43.067 --> 01:44.533
'Cause all I know
is that yesterday

01:44.600 --> 01:46.267
that one and only child
of yours

01:46.333 --> 01:47.667
was rummaging around,

01:47.733 --> 01:50.600
looking for her
daddy's Grammy.

01:50.667 --> 01:51.833
She was?

01:53.400 --> 01:54.767
Why you still got to
let that girl

01:54.833 --> 01:57.433
go around thinking
Nate earned that trophy

01:57.500 --> 01:59.367
when you know he won it
in a card game?

02:00.967 --> 02:02.667
What about
my dad's Grammy?

02:02.733 --> 02:04.067
Oh, hey, baby.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.267
No, Aunt Ida was just saying
she never thought

02:06.333 --> 02:07.633
"No Mystery"
was a good album.

02:07.700 --> 02:08.600
Never did.

02:08.667 --> 02:09.700
We've been
arguing about it

02:09.767 --> 02:11.367
for the last 14 years.
Mm-hmm.

02:11.433 --> 02:13.100
Come on, baby,
I made you some breakfast.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.500
Let's go down.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.200
Come on, Ida.
I'm coming.

02:34.867 --> 02:36.567
Yo, this shit ain't
working, man.

02:36.633 --> 02:37.700
Fuck that.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.067
The hook wack.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.433
You came up with it.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.633
So what you
wanna do?
Eat.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.200
Hell yes.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.833
Yo, can I use
your phone?
Yeah, yeah.

02:50.733 --> 02:51.733
Okay.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.900
Hi, you've reached
Damita's voicemail.

03:00.967 --> 03:02.400
Please leave a message
after the beep.

03:02.467 --> 03:04.133
Hey, Damita.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.667
It's DeeVee.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.200
Uh, I should be done with
this session a little later,

03:08.267 --> 03:11.900
so, uh... if you wanna
go to the movies,

03:11.967 --> 03:12.967
maybe go see
"Mo' Better Blues"

03:13.067 --> 03:14.333
or something...

03:15.433 --> 03:16.700
Page me back.

03:16.767 --> 03:17.733
Peace.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.067
Ready?

03:21.067 --> 03:22.600
Yeah, we out.
All right.

03:34.700 --> 03:35.667
Thank you, baby.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.400
So... top in
your class.

03:48.367 --> 03:50.633
Girl, you know,
I have been wondering

03:50.700 --> 03:52.067
what possessed
you to tear up

03:52.067 --> 03:53.433
that scholarship
from Harvard?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.567
You know, I'm so glad
to see you eat.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.800
You can't afford
to get any skinnier.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.400
Uh, I forgot the bacon.

04:04.367 --> 04:05.833
So, Nikki...

04:05.900 --> 04:08.067
now that you're home--
and we sure are glad

04:08.133 --> 04:10.467
that you back--
what's your plan?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.333
Uh, I--

04:14.400 --> 04:16.967
You know what, they're having
a job fair at my office today.

04:17.067 --> 04:17.967
You should swing by.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.133
It might surprise you.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.133
Mom, I don't--

04:21.200 --> 04:22.333
4:00.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.900
I've got the perfect
outfit for you.

04:35.867 --> 04:36.800
Come in.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.733
Hey.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
Hey, Josie.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.133
What's that?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.567
It's Imani's
new video.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.967
When did you start
shooting videos?

04:52.067 --> 04:53.300
Just trying it out.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.967
What you think?

04:57.067 --> 04:58.133
It's good.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.067
Yeah?
Yeah.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.600
Has Barry seen
it yet?

05:01.667 --> 05:03.400
Ah, with everything
going on--

05:03.467 --> 05:04.967
With everything
going on,

05:05.067 --> 05:06.800
I think it would
be nice to get Barry back

05:06.867 --> 05:08.067
working on music.

05:09.567 --> 05:10.667
You know what,
you're right.

05:10.733 --> 05:11.867
I'm gonna show him.
Yeah.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.100
Palmer, Terrell.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.367
That's you?

05:16.433 --> 05:18.133
Yup, sign here.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.667
Oh no!

05:19.733 --> 05:21.333
See, y'all
playing with me.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.400
Where's the rest
of my money?

05:23.467 --> 05:25.367
First of all, where's
your inside voice?

05:25.433 --> 05:26.933
This is an
office, dear.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.500
Listen, this is cash.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.100
No taxes,
no FICA.

05:31.167 --> 05:33.133
No shit.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.233
This is temporary,
all right?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.233
Until then, cheer up.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.633
It's tax free.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.833
But this the same amount
of money I get after taxes.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.267
Yes, exactly.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.533
Where's Barry?

05:47.200 --> 05:50.367
Whoo, uh...

05:50.433 --> 05:52.200
And it ain't
gonna be like priority.

05:52.267 --> 05:55.067
This is Fouray Records.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.233
And we gonna be
solid,

05:56.300 --> 05:57.333
just completely
solid like a family,

05:57.400 --> 05:58.933
you know what I'm saying?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.700
And so with a family, that
mean we gonna stick together,

06:00.767 --> 06:02.300
and we gonna do it this time.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.767
For sure, we're gonna stick
together this time for sure.

06:04.833 --> 06:08.367
That way-- that way when
we get to the top...

06:08.433 --> 06:10.567
then we get so much
respect because we stayed...
Fouray!

06:10.633 --> 06:12.067
What's up, man?

06:12.133 --> 06:13.333
Do I look like the kind of guy
that likes wasting his time?

06:13.400 --> 06:14.867
Nah, nigga.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.800
You look like the type of
motherfucker to have a...

06:17.867 --> 06:19.767
a polo shirt on
without the logo.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.133
And why is Anders
cancelling my vendors?

06:24.667 --> 06:26.800
No, I mean, I--
listen, I put him in charge.

06:26.867 --> 06:28.233
You're gonna have to talk
to him about that.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.133
Listen, downstairs,
that's Fouray Management.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.433
You upstairs.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.367
Up here...
you're in the future, baby.

06:35.433 --> 06:36.900
The future.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.800
Tell him to stop
cancelling my shit.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.367
I mean, I flew
all the way out here,

06:53.433 --> 06:54.667
the San Francisco Bay area,

06:54.733 --> 06:56.100
to hang out with Humpty
and Shock G,

06:56.167 --> 06:57.667
and say we've
been looking forward--

06:57.733 --> 06:58.867
Oh my God,
I'm sorry.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.333
I heard MTV was
in town.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.700
They told me
I need to...

07:10.833 --> 07:13.433
Nikki!
Hey, what up?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.300
Hey, what's going on?
What's up?

07:16.367 --> 07:18.233
I missed you.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.367
Wait.

07:19.433 --> 07:20.433
Who told-- wait.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.467
What are y'all
doing here?

07:21.533 --> 07:22.667
How did y'all
know I was home?

07:22.733 --> 07:25.067
Girl, please,
everybody knows.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.667
Wow.

07:28.533 --> 07:29.533
And, yo, I heard about
Dave too.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.867
I'm so--
Shh!

07:32.433 --> 07:33.667
We gonna kick it
like old times.

07:33.733 --> 07:35.067
Come on,
we partying.
Hey!

07:35.133 --> 07:36.733
That's what
I'm talking about.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.367
I don't know if she can
still hang with us, though.

07:39.433 --> 07:40.867
What are y'all
talking about?

07:40.933 --> 07:42.167
You know, you've been
hanging--

07:42.233 --> 07:43.267
Oh!

07:43.333 --> 07:45.067
Uh, nah, this is--

07:45.067 --> 07:46.167
Yo, my mom--

07:46.233 --> 07:47.300
I don't live here.

07:47.367 --> 07:48.333
Y'all know
my mama.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.600
I've got
a job interview today.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.167
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.867
Hook a sister up.
Could you give me
a minute?

07:52.933 --> 07:54.567
Goddang!

07:54.633 --> 07:56.333
Oh, thank you.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.467
Get some glasses.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.333
Did you park
the car?
Yeah.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.300
I can't believe we're talking
around my mom's coffee table.

08:01.367 --> 08:02.300
I know.

08:02.367 --> 08:03.867
How is your
mom?

08:03.933 --> 08:05.167
Good.

08:05.233 --> 08:06.233
Girl!

08:06.300 --> 08:07.333
What?

08:07.400 --> 08:08.633
What's up with
your hair?

08:08.700 --> 08:10.067
You need to
let me get up in there.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.067
What?

08:11.100 --> 08:12.533
It's not--
really?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.233
Really.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.767
Okay, but just
'cause it's you.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.200
Girl, you know
I'm gonna take care of you.

08:17.267 --> 08:18.433
Okay.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.133
So good to see you.
You too.

08:22.533 --> 08:23.567
For the last time,

08:23.633 --> 08:24.933
are you sure?

08:25.067 --> 08:26.433
Yes!

08:26.500 --> 08:28.467
How many times
I gotta say it?

08:28.533 --> 08:30.667
They covered my head!

08:30.733 --> 08:32.600
I didn't see
nobody.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.667
All I remember
is that goddamn tattoo.

08:34.733 --> 08:36.733
The one on his right hand
shaped like a country.

08:36.800 --> 08:37.933
Right, right.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.600
And you ain't seen
nothing else?

08:39.667 --> 08:41.233
They just said "run"
and you heard the shots.

08:43.567 --> 08:44.833
All right.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.267
Tell me if you
see anything.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.300
Here.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.300
This is the one.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.933
Are you sure?

09:08.367 --> 09:09.333
Yeah.

09:10.733 --> 09:12.600
Well, Africa ain't
a country, sweetheart.

09:15.533 --> 09:17.767
You sure about this?

09:20.933 --> 09:23.067
I-- you said
I need a change.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.567
It's gonna be
a big change.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.367
But I trust you.

09:29.433 --> 09:30.367
Okay, girl.

09:31.633 --> 09:33.067
Let's do it.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.833
Can't go back now.

09:50.233 --> 09:51.600
Come on, relax,
relax, relax.
Come on, man!

09:51.667 --> 09:52.867
So who do we got here?

09:52.933 --> 09:54.567
Y'all can't wait to
lock a nigga up, right?

09:54.633 --> 09:55.933
What you doing?

09:56.067 --> 09:57.800
So what, is my tattoo
illegal or some shit like--

09:57.867 --> 09:59.733
get the fuck out of here!

09:59.800 --> 10:01.900
It depends on what
you did with it.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.200
Besides mind my own
damn business

10:03.267 --> 10:05.600
before your flunkies
got in my fucking face!

10:05.667 --> 10:07.067
What the fuck
did I do?

10:08.500 --> 10:10.100
You slipped up.

10:10.167 --> 10:12.400
Unlike your boy,
Ahmed Harris.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.667
I owe you one,
fellas.
Hey.

10:18.733 --> 10:20.300
You're a motherfucker!
Fuck you!

10:26.267 --> 10:27.333
Thank you.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.067
Yo, so I meant to
ask you, right...

10:40.267 --> 10:41.400
... how'd you
start rapping?

10:43.633 --> 10:44.900
I was in juvie.

10:47.467 --> 10:48.467
Locked up.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.900
Start writing lyrics
on the low.

10:52.067 --> 10:53.667
Niggas thought I was
writing letters home,

10:53.733 --> 10:55.733
but there wasn't nobody
to write to.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.067
Not your fam?

10:59.133 --> 11:01.167
Nah, B... nah.

11:02.733 --> 11:04.433
My man Smoke was
doing a bid

11:04.500 --> 11:05.433
at the same time.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.267
He read my
lyrics...

11:11.200 --> 11:12.500
... decides to
spit them shits.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.767
So you started battling
in juvie?

11:15.833 --> 11:18.300
Yeah.

11:18.367 --> 11:19.367
Smoke pushed
a nigga.

11:21.467 --> 11:23.533
Said it would remind me what
it felt like when I was out.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.800
Well, did it?

11:29.600 --> 11:30.833
Yeah.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.833
Mr. Jacobs can
see you now.

12:02.067 --> 12:03.500
Oh, you know,
answering phones.

12:03.567 --> 12:06.700
Maybe some shorthand
every once in awhile.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.900
And then there's filing

12:08.967 --> 12:11.567
by last name
always.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.167
Is there any other way?

12:15.467 --> 12:16.733
Thank you.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.900
Your mom speaks
very highly of you.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.100
I think you would do
very well here, Nikki.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.467
The job's yours
if you want it.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.633
Oh, oh!

12:31.700 --> 12:33.267
Great!
Wow, thanks!

12:33.333 --> 12:34.633
My pleasure.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.967
I already told you
on the phone

12:49.067 --> 12:50.367
we're not gonna
settle the suit,

12:50.433 --> 12:53.300
but feel free to order
some eggs if you want.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.667
Oh, nah.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.500
Eggs don't
suit me.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.667
I was actually
thinking of an order of...

13:00.733 --> 13:02.267
$50,000 a family

13:02.333 --> 13:05.200
to withdraw from
the suit immediately,

13:05.267 --> 13:07.933
with a side of "I can have
those checks to you tomorrow."

13:09.067 --> 13:10.200
You mean
the insurance company

13:10.267 --> 13:12.433
can have those checks
cut tomorrow.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.233
Look, the fact of
the matter is,

13:14.300 --> 13:15.933
we're ready to settle.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.133
50,000, huh?

13:22.433 --> 13:23.533
50,000 tomorrow.

13:35.067 --> 13:36.500
I'll see you in court,
Counselor.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.667
Fouray, you're not
even watching.

13:54.733 --> 13:55.867
I worked
hard on this.

13:55.933 --> 13:56.867
Watching?
Watching?

13:56.933 --> 13:57.867
You ain't doing shit.

13:57.933 --> 13:59.367
I don't see
shit to watch.

13:59.433 --> 14:02.267
Why don't you do some shit
where you telling a story

14:02.333 --> 14:03.900
and you using
fucking movement?

14:03.967 --> 14:05.233
Like things are
moving.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.933
Yelling at me about
watching some shit

14:07.067 --> 14:07.933
that ain't
even fucking there!

14:08.067 --> 14:09.433
What you want me
to do?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.533
Showing... fucking still shots
of people all over the place

14:12.600 --> 14:14.133
and wasting my money.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.067
You couldn't have pulled
me aside for that?

14:17.067 --> 14:18.067
For what?

14:18.100 --> 14:19.233
Bad's bad
in private too.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.600
Do it matter?
Fuck you, Barry!

14:20.667 --> 14:22.067
Whoa!

14:22.067 --> 14:25.167
Like that?
Are you serious?
Yeah, it's like that.

14:25.233 --> 14:26.633
It's bad, it's true.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.433
Goddamn!

14:29.500 --> 14:30.700
No!

14:30.767 --> 14:32.067
That's my marketing.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.367
What's this motherfucker
talking about?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.700
What Mr. Anders
and his client, Barry Fouray,

14:41.767 --> 14:44.433
fail to understand is that
this is not about money.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.367
This is about parents
protecting their children

14:47.433 --> 14:50.433
from opportunists disguised
as businessmen.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.267
If we lose
the civil suit,

14:53.333 --> 14:55.067
you know the insurance ain't
gonna cover that.

14:56.867 --> 14:58.100
That's terrible.

14:58.167 --> 15:00.100
That'll be fucking
terrible.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.533
Yo, it's-- it's Josie.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.533
Your mom
let me in.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.733
I'm looking for
Nikki.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.867
Is she here?

15:10.933 --> 15:12.367
It's just that Barry's
being such an ass,

15:12.433 --> 15:13.400
and after what
he did to her,

15:13.467 --> 15:14.867
I wanna make sure
she's okay.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.900
She's not here
and now's not a good time.

15:17.967 --> 15:19.400
Whoa, hold up.

15:19.467 --> 15:20.767
Who-- who did this
to you?

15:25.267 --> 15:26.367
I don't really wanna
get into it

15:26.433 --> 15:27.767
and I don't need
people making a fuss.

15:29.633 --> 15:30.867
You don't have to
tell me.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.567
But can I at least
help you with that?

15:49.567 --> 15:50.900
Does that hurt?

15:52.800 --> 15:54.967
I've been hit
before too.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.567
Yeah, when I was 11,

15:56.633 --> 15:59.067
I got beat up by this boy
a year older.

16:01.267 --> 16:03.067
Ken.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.800
I hated that kid.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.067
He called me a chink
the whole time

16:06.067 --> 16:07.500
he was pounding on me.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.500
I had to ask what that
word meant.

16:09.567 --> 16:10.900
And the fact that
he was using a slur

16:10.967 --> 16:14.267
for Chinese people just
made it worse.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.533
But he didn't
know any better.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.433
My mom was pissed
when I told her.

16:21.300 --> 16:22.633
So what happened?

16:24.867 --> 16:27.300
She told me to
keep quiet.

16:27.367 --> 16:28.700
Say I fell off
the jungle gym.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.700
I know she wanted to
protect me but...

16:33.767 --> 16:36.067
to me, it felt like she
wanted to protect herself.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.633
I mean...

16:39.700 --> 16:41.233
we weren't even
citizens yet,

16:41.300 --> 16:43.500
we were about
to open the store,

16:43.567 --> 16:45.200
and she didn't wanna
make waves.

16:45.267 --> 16:46.567
So why didn't you
fight back?

16:48.100 --> 16:49.067
'Cause I was scared.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.600
And I needed somebody
to tell me

16:51.667 --> 16:52.967
it was okay to fight.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.333
It's okay to fight.

16:58.900 --> 16:59.867
You don't get it.

17:01.433 --> 17:04.967
If I go to the police,
I'm a snitch.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.367
You can't be a snitch
and make it in hip-hop.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.100
Yeah... I know.

17:11.467 --> 17:12.733
You ready?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.100
Yeah.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.600
Starting from the right,
step forward,

17:20.667 --> 17:21.900
say, "Run, bitch."

17:24.067 --> 17:25.167
Run, you bitch.

17:26.733 --> 17:27.900
Yo, stupid,
it's, "Run, bitch."

17:27.967 --> 17:29.733
You got me confused
with somebody

17:29.800 --> 17:31.900
who gives
an actual fuck.
Why are you mad
at me--

17:31.967 --> 17:33.100
Knock it off!

17:33.167 --> 17:34.100
Number two.

17:35.967 --> 17:36.933
Run, bitch.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.067
Number three.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.133
Run, bitch.

17:54.633 --> 17:55.933
You want him
to say it again?

18:04.833 --> 18:05.933
No.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.867
It ain't him.
Excuse me?!

18:09.333 --> 18:10.267
I said it ain't him.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.467
It ain't
none of them.

18:11.533 --> 18:13.067
So that's not
the Africa tattoo

18:13.133 --> 18:14.067
you saw that night?

18:14.133 --> 18:15.433
I'm sorry, okay?

18:15.500 --> 18:16.667
I'm sorry for wasting
your time.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.200
You heard her.

18:31.267 --> 18:32.533
Let 'em go.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.100
Oh, so you gonna act
like you don't see me.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.167
Okay... whatever.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.067
Sweet and sour chicken
and shrimp fried rice.

19:04.967 --> 19:05.900
You good?

19:07.333 --> 19:08.767
Yeah.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.833
It's just this girl
I'm feeling, right?

19:13.900 --> 19:15.067
I've been
calling all day.

19:15.133 --> 19:17.367
She ain't answering none
of my calls.

19:17.433 --> 19:18.833
She's not calling back.

19:20.833 --> 19:22.567
It's not like she's not
feeling me back, you know?

19:22.633 --> 19:23.967
It...

19:24.067 --> 19:25.633
I don't know,
it's just weird, man.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.800
Hey... you mind running me
over there real fast?

19:36.333 --> 19:37.633
Let's go.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.533
Baby, you need
to slow down.
I do?

19:50.600 --> 19:51.667
You don't even know
what's going on--

19:51.733 --> 19:53.467
I know exactly
what's going on.

19:53.533 --> 19:54.700
What do you mean?
Move!

19:54.767 --> 19:56.500
This is what
the fuck is going on.

19:56.567 --> 19:57.867
Lisa...

19:58.967 --> 20:00.700
Lisa, this is you,
Lisa.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.833
Look... that's you.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.933
This is what's
the fuck going on!

20:05.000 --> 20:07.200
You gotta start large
to get large.

20:07.267 --> 20:08.633
Y'all know that?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.767
Motherfuckers gotta start
large to get large.

20:10.833 --> 20:12.167
I'm not doing
a press release.

20:12.233 --> 20:13.700
Everybody do that.

20:13.767 --> 20:17.100
I'm sick of doing everything
everybody fucking do!

20:17.167 --> 20:19.233
Fouray Records
ain't doing that!

20:19.300 --> 20:21.300
When Fouray Records come in
the motherfucking house,

20:21.367 --> 20:23.900
they just gonna turn
this shit over on its ear!

20:23.967 --> 20:26.400
It's gonna be lovely.
Man, you should do
a showcase.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.067
What?
You should do
a showcase.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.167
Who said that?
Me, I said that.

20:30.233 --> 20:31.167
Oh, my man.

20:31.233 --> 20:32.733
The fuck, finally!

20:32.800 --> 20:34.633
It's the motherfucker
I fuck with

20:34.700 --> 20:36.200
who got my back.

20:36.267 --> 20:37.367
Thank you!

20:37.433 --> 20:38.533
You know what,
nigga?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.767
Nigga...

20:40.833 --> 20:44.733
I'm gonna make you
VP of marketing, nigga.

20:44.800 --> 20:45.967
You're the VP
of marketing.

20:46.033 --> 20:47.333
Lisa, what you doing
over there?

20:47.400 --> 20:48.700
Get over here!

20:48.767 --> 20:50.167
Barry, you need
to sit down.
Get his name!

20:50.233 --> 20:51.800
Are you pulling me?
And some water.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.367
Are you pulling me?

20:53.433 --> 20:54.567
I'm asking you
to get his name.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.900
Who got a pen...
who got a pen?

20:58.733 --> 21:02.267
Select press, for sure,
invite only.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.933
Imani X, D-Rome, J-Mic.

21:05.067 --> 21:06.600
We need
break dancers there

21:06.667 --> 21:08.800
and I want the motherfuckers
from Harlem.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.067
Make sure you
write that down.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.300
We need money people there.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.367
I need Orson Deep--

21:16.433 --> 21:18.767
Yo, I need Orson Deep Pockets
Banbridge!
Barry!

21:18.833 --> 21:21.433
Barry, stop, Barry, stop,
you're acting crazy.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.667
What?

21:22.733 --> 21:24.500
What the fuck
you know about me?

21:24.567 --> 21:25.933
What the fuck do you
really know?!

21:26.067 --> 21:27.700
What do you do, huh?!

21:27.767 --> 21:28.833
Why the fuck are you
even here?!

21:28.900 --> 21:30.767
You actually never here!

21:30.833 --> 21:31.867
And you know what
you did?

21:31.933 --> 21:33.500
You fucking quit on me

21:33.567 --> 21:34.600
and now you trying to
stop me

21:34.667 --> 21:36.167
and try to
tell me shit.

21:36.233 --> 21:37.333
Really?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.067
You fucking quit
on me.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.467
So know what
I want you to do,

21:40.533 --> 21:41.933
sit your fucking ass down,

21:42.067 --> 21:43.567
continue to be
pretty

21:43.633 --> 21:45.067
before I change my mind.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.600
Hey... you gonna
be back.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.100
Ahh!

22:08.467 --> 22:10.300
Mmm... ahh!

22:15.467 --> 22:17.167
Connect me-- hello?

22:17.233 --> 22:18.733
Ahh...

22:18.800 --> 22:21.567
Connect me to, um,
to Banbridge Music.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.067
Yeah, this is Barry Fouray.

22:24.100 --> 22:28.233
Um, I'm calling to-- to invite,
uh, Orson Banbridge.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.633
It's our party.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.800
I wanna-- I wanna invite him
as my personal guest too

22:32.867 --> 22:34.167
of the debut
of Fouray Records.

22:35.433 --> 22:36.700
Our debut.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.533
Oh, yes, I will be
honored to have you.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.667
Yes, yes.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.667
You're saying that?

22:40.733 --> 22:42.333
All right.

22:46.767 --> 22:48.500
Honeys
look like aliens.

22:49.833 --> 22:51.067
Yo, yo, yo!

22:53.167 --> 22:54.867
What's going on,
what's going on?
He's on the floor
and he's shaking!

22:54.933 --> 22:55.900
Who's on the floor?
Barry!

22:58.400 --> 23:00.067
Everybody out,
everybody out!

23:00.067 --> 23:01.300
Barry!

23:01.367 --> 23:03.067
Barry...
Barry, come on.

23:03.067 --> 23:04.567
Barry...

23:04.633 --> 23:06.667
Come on, Barry,
come on, Barry!

23:06.733 --> 23:08.233
Come on, baby.
Barry!

23:08.300 --> 23:10.200
Tamika--
Barry!
What?

23:10.267 --> 23:11.700
Take this number
and call this guy.

23:11.767 --> 23:13.700
Tell him to get
here now.
Okay.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.433
Come on, B,
come on, B.

23:32.533 --> 23:35.300
Come on, Damita,
I came all this way.

23:35.367 --> 23:37.100
I didn't ask you to.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.933
I just wanna make sure
you're all right.

23:39.067 --> 23:41.067
I'm fine...
thank you.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.300
Bye.

23:42.367 --> 23:43.600
Look, I don't know what
you got going on

23:43.667 --> 23:46.400
with you right now,
but I wanna help, okay?

23:46.467 --> 23:48.400
But I can't if you
don't let me in.

23:51.133 --> 23:52.300
Please?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.533
Don't make this into
like a thing.

23:59.633 --> 24:01.667
Okay, can you--
can you do that?

24:01.733 --> 24:02.800
Okay, fine, whatever.

24:02.867 --> 24:04.167
Anything.

24:04.233 --> 24:05.533
Just open the door.

24:20.233 --> 24:21.367
What happened?

24:23.867 --> 24:25.700
He freaked out at me
because of the article.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.300
Who?

24:30.067 --> 24:32.067
Gordy.

24:38.133 --> 24:39.633
You all right?

24:39.700 --> 24:40.633
Yeah.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.367
I'll be back.

24:45.433 --> 24:47.667
DeeVee, don't do
anything stupid!

25:03.167 --> 25:04.200
Yo, Gordy.

25:04.267 --> 25:06.100
Hey, big-time
producer.

25:06.167 --> 25:07.100
Have a seat, man!

25:07.167 --> 25:08.300
We'll get you
all set up!

25:17.900 --> 25:19.067
It takes a real tough
motherfucker

25:19.100 --> 25:20.667
to hit a lady, right?!

25:20.733 --> 25:23.067
Try that shit again
and see what happens!

25:31.100 --> 25:34.200
You act like a bitch,
you get treated like a bitch!

25:34.267 --> 25:35.200
Stay right there!

25:36.267 --> 25:37.500
Yeah, you know what?

25:37.567 --> 25:38.900
You came all this way...
Oh, hell no, man!

25:38.967 --> 25:41.500
... and didn't even try
my mama's mac and cheese.

25:41.567 --> 25:42.567
Huh?!

25:42.633 --> 25:44.233
Don't you come around
here no more.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.900
Go get your girl
before I call the police.

25:54.933 --> 25:55.900
Two gin and tonics.

25:55.967 --> 25:57.067
Here we go.

25:57.067 --> 25:58.567
I cannot believe you!

25:58.633 --> 26:01.200
Walk into that office
and land a job like...

26:01.267 --> 26:02.567
I mean...

26:02.633 --> 26:04.100
This calls for
another round.

26:04.167 --> 26:05.633
Another round?

26:05.700 --> 26:06.900
Ahh...

26:06.967 --> 26:09.700
Hey, so you-- you went
all the way up to New York

26:09.767 --> 26:11.500
to come back home?

26:11.567 --> 26:13.300
Boy, get out
of my face.

26:13.367 --> 26:14.800
Here.

26:16.267 --> 26:17.800
I'm gonna go meet up
with the band.

26:19.133 --> 26:20.267
All right.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.467
Cheers.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.567
Ooh!

26:25.633 --> 26:27.500
My little brother
Mikey grew up?

26:27.567 --> 26:28.967
Mm-mm, not that much.

26:29.067 --> 26:30.300
Little bit.

26:30.367 --> 26:31.967
He's still your
little brother, girl.

26:34.900 --> 26:36.933
Girl, so what is up
with the salon?

26:37.067 --> 26:39.567
Girl, I just need money
to get started, you know?

26:39.633 --> 26:41.500
It's hard getting things
off the ground.

26:41.567 --> 26:44.333
Girl, I can't
believe you're back.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.267
We gonna kick it every
weekend.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.300
The clubs!

26:48.367 --> 26:50.300
All right, yeah.

26:50.367 --> 26:52.633
Yeah, this place is dope,
it's dope.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.400
This crowd out here tonight.

26:54.467 --> 26:56.967
There are some sexy
ladies up in here.

26:57.067 --> 26:59.767
Yo, we about to get down,
but before we do,

26:59.833 --> 27:02.433
I got one
thing to ask y'all.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.367
Huh, you ready?

27:16.100 --> 27:17.133
Man, come on now!

27:17.200 --> 27:19.733
Hey, yeah!

27:19.800 --> 27:21.967
All the ladies in the back
come over to the front, baby.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.367
I need y'all in the front row
right here

27:23.433 --> 27:24.733
to help me out.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.233
Special dedication going out
to the JYV!

27:27.300 --> 27:28.333
DC in the house!

27:28.400 --> 27:30.467
Let me hear you say,
"Yeah!"

27:56.800 --> 27:57.933
You sure you wanna
keep working?

27:59.200 --> 28:00.633
Yeah.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.067
Fuck that fat, fake

28:02.067 --> 28:03.867
Dapper Dan-wearing
motherfucker.

28:08.867 --> 28:10.733
Peter Piper beat
on this, right?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.633
No, that's
Bob James "Two."

28:30.933 --> 28:33.633
Not exactly what I would've
picked to play but...

28:33.700 --> 28:34.933
Pick something else.

28:38.867 --> 28:39.800
No, wait.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.667
We keeping this.

29:42.367 --> 29:43.500
Who is it?

29:54.533 --> 29:56.067
I told you to run, bitch.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.533
What you think?

30:23.767 --> 30:25.400
It's missing something.

30:25.467 --> 30:26.833
What?

30:26.900 --> 30:28.000
We got the hook.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.667
I know,
and it's dope,

30:29.733 --> 30:31.700
it's just...

30:31.767 --> 30:33.667
I don't know, I'm not
feeling something

30:33.733 --> 30:35.167
that I wanna
feel in this.

30:39.167 --> 30:40.300
Good.

30:42.533 --> 30:43.700
You wanna feel good.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.333
What are you
talking about?

30:48.700 --> 30:50.567
Before I just
did this shit,

30:50.633 --> 30:52.433
you know, 'cause I missed
that feeling.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.333
Battles,
I'd relax that way.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.467
Something changed when...
with that first song.

30:58.533 --> 31:00.867
I started to
feel all right again.

31:00.933 --> 31:02.100
But I don't no more.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.433
So rap about that.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.067
All right.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.333
What you gonna do?

31:23.433 --> 31:24.567
His heart rate
and blood pressure

31:24.633 --> 31:25.933
have been stabilized.

31:26.067 --> 31:28.233
The benzodiazepines
contained the seizure.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.500
He just needs
some rest.

31:30.567 --> 31:32.167
And of course
no more cocaine.

31:32.233 --> 31:33.300
Got ya.

31:36.333 --> 31:38.100
Call me when he
comes to, all right?
Mm-hmm.

31:39.933 --> 31:41.633
Thanks, Doc.
Anytime, man.

31:41.700 --> 31:42.933
I'll walk you out.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.433
"I will give you
back your health

31:59.500 --> 32:01.600
and heal your wounds,"
said the Lord.

32:03.767 --> 32:06.233
"For you are
called an outcast--

32:06.300 --> 32:10.367
'Jerusalem for whom
no one cares.'"

32:14.067 --> 32:15.233
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:15.300 --> 32:17.167
you are listening to
the sounds

32:17.233 --> 32:18.700
of the one,
the only...

32:18.767 --> 32:21.067
Ahm...

32:21.067 --> 32:24.067
... and super producer
DJ DeeVee!

32:24.067 --> 32:25.967
Yeah, rest in peace.

32:26.067 --> 32:27.500
That's your man?

32:28.767 --> 32:30.533
Yeah, God bless.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.867
I'm telling you, man.

32:35.967 --> 32:37.600
Do this a couple
more times,

32:37.667 --> 32:38.600
you got an album.

32:39.867 --> 32:41.833
You really think
it's dope.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.667
Dope?

32:43.733 --> 32:47.200
Man, this is the greatest
thing that I've ever created.

32:47.267 --> 32:50.200
This blows the first record
out of the water.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.333
People gotta
hear this, man.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.067
I guess.

32:54.067 --> 32:55.333
So we can
put it out?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.233
Yeah, rest in peace.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.767
As long as the law know how
dope we was a few weeks back,

33:01.833 --> 33:04.933
when we was here,
recording all day,

33:05.067 --> 33:06.267
else there ain't
no "we."

33:09.500 --> 33:10.733
Wait...

33:10.800 --> 33:12.067
But, wait, I...

33:12.067 --> 33:14.233
I thought this was
about feeling good, man.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.433
I feel good
right now.

33:20.633 --> 33:22.167
Album will be dope.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.067
Uh, I was
gonna do that.

33:42.133 --> 33:43.767
You cut your hair?

33:43.833 --> 33:45.100
You like it?

33:45.167 --> 33:46.567
It's kind of late,
ain't it?

33:51.067 --> 33:52.533
I was with Vanessa,
she brought Mike.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.333
Oh, those two.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.733
Well, I hope you got
your rest.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.300
Tomorrow's your first day.

33:58.367 --> 33:59.633
I'll be fine,
Mom.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.667
What else I need to know?

34:03.733 --> 34:06.667
Mr. Jacobs likes
alphabetical, numerical order.

34:08.233 --> 34:10.533
Bullet points on your memos
is always a good idea.

34:21.667 --> 34:24.300
How come you didn't tell
me Dad stole his Grammy?

34:26.733 --> 34:28.067
He didn't steal it.

34:28.133 --> 34:30.267
He won it...
in a card game.

34:31.467 --> 34:32.633
But I saw
him play.

34:32.700 --> 34:34.133
He was good.

34:35.633 --> 34:36.967
He was a better
gambler.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.833
That's all
you're gonna say?

34:40.900 --> 34:42.700
Mom, why didn't
you tell me?

34:53.167 --> 34:55.133
That was up to him
when he was with us.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.467
And after...

34:59.533 --> 35:00.733
after...

35:02.567 --> 35:04.567
... I didn't wanna
take that from you too.

35:07.367 --> 35:09.100
I know how much you
looked up to him.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.633
So he wasn't good?

35:15.133 --> 35:16.333
He wanted to be.

35:18.167 --> 35:21.633
Oh, Nate wanted to be
in the light so bad.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.867
It just...

35:23.933 --> 35:26.200
it never felt right
for him.

35:26.267 --> 35:27.633
Said he just
didn't have the chops.

35:29.367 --> 35:31.267
But Daddy had an ear,
though.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.500
He would sit in on
everybody's session

35:33.567 --> 35:34.800
and tell 'em what was
right or wrong

35:34.867 --> 35:36.200
with their music.

35:37.767 --> 35:39.367
You know, some bands,
they wouldn't even gig

35:39.433 --> 35:41.133
without the Nate Jones
stamp.

35:42.233 --> 35:43.433
But it wasn't enough.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.567
No.

35:49.833 --> 35:50.800
It wasn't.

35:59.267 --> 36:00.467
Mr. Jacobs?

36:01.833 --> 36:03.367
Oh, yeah, right.

36:14.567 --> 36:16.700
Mr. Jacob prefers
black pens,

36:16.767 --> 36:19.967
so always keep
the drawer fully stocked.

36:20.067 --> 36:21.800
Except when there are
markups.

36:21.867 --> 36:23.567
Then he
likes red pens.

36:23.633 --> 36:25.233
And when he has to
sign something,

36:25.300 --> 36:26.500
he prefers blue.

36:26.567 --> 36:29.067
So never give him
anything to sign

36:29.133 --> 36:30.400
with a black pen.

36:32.067 --> 36:33.300
Black pens to write.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.600
Right.

36:36.967 --> 36:38.333
Blue pens to sign.

36:39.767 --> 36:40.767
That's my girl.

36:46.067 --> 36:47.133
Mom.

36:48.567 --> 36:50.067
I was seeing like
all kinds of shit,

36:50.100 --> 36:51.767
like... all kinds of shit.

36:51.833 --> 36:53.567
You feel me,
my nigga?
Gonna get your
ass laced.

36:55.067 --> 36:56.833
What you talking about,
son?

36:56.900 --> 36:58.633
What up?

36:58.700 --> 36:59.467
Mm-hmm.

36:59.533 --> 37:00.800
The count's straight.

37:00.867 --> 37:03.533
Even though
Screw Ass overslept again.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.567
You know that nigga
bought a new polo.

37:05.633 --> 37:07.200
He should've got
an alarm clock.

37:07.267 --> 37:08.633
You know what I mean?

37:09.933 --> 37:11.733
That's it?

37:11.800 --> 37:12.900
Yeah.

37:12.967 --> 37:15.433
You know, alternate side
parking tomorrow.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.667
Right, right.

37:25.833 --> 37:26.767
All right.

37:38.967 --> 37:41.367
Alternate side parking?

37:41.433 --> 37:43.133
Either I'm deaf
or you got amnesia.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.700
Look, man...

37:44.767 --> 37:47.200
from now on, my business
is on a need-to-know basis.

37:47.267 --> 37:48.533
All right?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.500
And weak-ass niggas
don't need to know.

37:51.800 --> 37:52.933
You feel me?

37:54.233 --> 37:55.567
What?

37:57.067 --> 37:58.200
My nigga.

38:54.567 --> 38:56.567
Oh, what?

38:56.633 --> 38:58.400
What, you wanna get
your ass beat too?

39:01.967 --> 39:04.067
Hey.

39:04.067 --> 39:05.700
Hey, come on, man...
all right?

39:05.767 --> 39:07.233
It-- it--
it ain't even got to be

39:07.300 --> 39:09.167
like that, all right?

39:09.233 --> 39:10.433
Your man hit me
first, man.

39:45.067 --> 39:46.833

40:05.667 --> 40:07.200
Ahm's boy is still outside
waiting for me.

40:07.267 --> 40:10.567
You need to do this so
