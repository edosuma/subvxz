20:49.700 --> 20:51.133
THEY DITCHED ME

20:51.133 --> 20:53.200
JUST BECAUSE I CRUSHED
THEM AT MINI GOLF.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.934
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

20:54.934 --> 20:57.367
I PROVED THAT A GIRL
BEATING ME WAS
JUST A FLUKE.

20:57.367 --> 21:00.300
WELL, I HOPE
THAT WAS

21:00.300 --> 21:01.734
WORTH LOSING
YOUR FRIENDS.

21:01.734 --> 21:03.667
LOOK, HONEY, IF
YOU'RE GONNA USE

21:03.667 --> 21:05.834
YOUR COMPETITIVE
DRIVE TO IMPROVE
YOURSELF,

21:05.834 --> 21:07.467
THAT'S GREAT.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.100
BUT IF THE ONLY
THING THAT MATTERS
TO YOU IS WINNING,

21:09.100 --> 21:12.600
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
GONNA END UP
THE REAL LOSER.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.800
GET IT?

21:13.800 --> 21:15.500
YEAH, I GET IT.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.100
AND GET THIS, TOO.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.400
A GIRL CAN DO
WHATEVER
A BOY CAN DO.

21:19.400 --> 21:23.000
AND WE CAN DO IT
WHILE WEARING
HIGH HEELS.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.767
Zack: OH, HEY, GUYS.

21:25.767 --> 21:27.900
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.100
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

21:30.100 --> 21:31.500
APOLOGY NOT ACCEPTED.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.900
YEAH, I COULDN'T
CARE LESS.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.500
ELLA, I'M SORRY I
CALLED YOU A LOSER.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.900
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE IF YOU CAN
BEAT ME AT MINIATURE GOLF.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.300
I JUST CARE IF I
CAN'T SEE YOU AGAIN.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.767
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?

21:43.767 --> 21:45.867
OF COURSE I FORGIVE
YOU, ZACK.

21:45.867 --> 21:47.500
THANK YOU.

21:47.500 --> 21:51.233
BY THE WAY,
I LET YOU WIN.

21:51.233 --> 21:54.400
DID NOT, DID YOU?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.734
MAYBE I DID.

21:56.734 --> 21:58.400
MAYBE
I DIDN'T.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.734
OH, SO THAT'S HOW
YOU WANT IT.

22:00.734 --> 22:02.367
FINE. BEST 2 OUT OF 3?

22:02.367 --> 22:03.600
YOU'RE ON.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.767
OH, AND IF YOU WIN,
IT'S THE BEST 5 OUT OF 9.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.000
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
BARBARA AND I ARE GOING

22:11.000 --> 22:12.400
TO THE LIBRARY
THIS TIME.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.100
I'LL COME WITH YOU. THERE'S
A PIZZA PARLOR ON THE WAY.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.967
I TOOK THE STAIRS
THIS MORNING...

22:18.967 --> 22:20.300
DOWN.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.967
Cody: DROP IT!
