07:43.130 --> 07:44.262
What documentary?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.664
(jeremy)
oh, i'm directing a film

07:45.666 --> 07:47.232
About elizabeth's life
in the theater.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.267
Now that elaine stritch
is finally dead,

07:49.269 --> 07:52.137
There's an opening for a new
great dame of broadway,

07:52.139 --> 07:54.639
And i plan on beating
tyne daly to that spot.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.308
(jeremy)
it's following us
through our wedding

07:56.310 --> 07:58.944
And up to opening night of
what we're currently calling

07:58.946 --> 08:01.346
<i>The biggest broad</i>
<i>on broadway.</i>

08:01.348 --> 08:03.482
It's a one-woman show
i'm writing for elizabeth.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.784
No one knew who the hell
elaine stritch was

08:05.786 --> 08:08.620
Before she did a one-woman show
when she was 70.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.689
Well, let me tell you,
i smoke more than she did.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.991
I drank her under the table
multiple times,

08:12.993 --> 08:14.960
And now she's dead,
and i'm not.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.295
This show is gonna win me
my tony.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.297
- And me mine.
- Muah.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.632
Ma, i'll do an interview,
no problem.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.867
(jeremy)
uh, okay.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.235
Let me just
check the list here.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.339
- Nope, nope, you're not on it.
(ava) but he's family.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.641
(jeremy)
well, it's not just
about family, dear.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.309
It's about famous family.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.278
See, flash connects us
with gaga's audience,

08:33.280 --> 08:34.946
And gigi connects us with
the young adult audience,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.982
And heck, you over there,
you connect us to neptune.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.951
[wheezing laugh]

08:39.953 --> 08:41.486
Anyway, it's all about
festivals now.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.688
Sundance, toronto.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.990
We need big names.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.558
I just met her
20 seconds ago.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.126
I don't really know
what i would say.

08:48.128 --> 08:52.330
Oh, our talking points are
all right here on these cards.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.866
All my charity work--aids,
animals, the environment.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.401
She's so selfless.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.870
And don't forget to mention
my battle with cancer.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.138
She's so brave.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.740
And we'd like to focus
on the fact

09:01.742 --> 09:04.543
That i was the first choice
for the role of mary poppins,

09:04.545 --> 09:05.810
The role of a lifetime.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.312
Wait.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.648
Is mary poppins the one
with dick van dyke?

09:09.650 --> 09:10.582
The very same, yes.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.983
Yes, with the magic car,

09:11.985 --> 09:13.151
The one that flies
all around.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.386
I love that movie.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.087
(elizabeth)
sweetheart,
in my movie,

09:16.089 --> 09:17.722
Mary poppins flies around.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.592
Well, no, in your movie,
julie andrews flies around.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.166
[laughs]

09:28.168 --> 09:29.100
I love this girl.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.202
[laughs]

09:31.204 --> 09:32.671
Oh, you're too much.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.778
(johnny)
hey, dad.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.912
(gigi)
hey, grandpa t.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.913
You just get here?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.416
Just in time for
the kiss

09:44.418 --> 09:45.717
And two double bourbons.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.218
You know how much i love
show folk.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.220
Well, not everyone here
is in show business.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.222
Yes, and that definitely
includes your father.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.591
[laughs]

09:52.593 --> 09:53.558
Here we go.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.727
Gigi, do yourself a favor.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.929
Get out of this business
while the getting is good.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.198
Dad, she's not, like,
some wide-eyed kid.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.600
I mean, she's got real talent.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.134
I know, so did you.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.436
I'm just saying
don't waste your life

10:04.438 --> 10:05.937
Chasing after vanity
and rejection.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.305
Oh, boy.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.741
Don't wake up
at age 50 or 70

10:09.743 --> 10:12.243
Still broke and invisible.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.245
(gigi)
okay, and you don't miss
playing music a little bit?

10:14.247 --> 10:15.614
A little bit?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.549
I realized i wasn't
good enough

10:17.551 --> 10:20.118
To compete against
my musical contemporaries,

10:20.120 --> 10:22.420
So i woke up one morning
when i was about your age

10:22.422 --> 10:24.889
And decided to do something
different with my life.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.257
Became a doctor.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.926
I was actually better than
my contemporaries.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.427
My contemporaries
ripped me off.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.563
- Of course they did.
- You know that story.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.798
Failed show folk always
have an excuse.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.233
Someone stabbed me
in the back.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.801
Someone took my
stage persona.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.103
Dulli took my stage persona.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.939
Somebody slept with
a director.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.440
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.744
Julie andrews was better
than johnny's mom.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.012
That's why
she got the job.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.581
It wasn't about
the baby.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.349
It was about
julie andrews' voice.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.251
No excuses.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.687
I'm not gonna say it.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.955
But i will say--

10:56.957 --> 10:58.857
Greg dulli,
here we go.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.026
Here we go.
Bring out the violins.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.871
- Dude.
- What?

11:12.873 --> 11:16.141
Over my left shoulder.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.810
My left shoulder.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.445
Yeah?
So what.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.947
That chick back there
is giving me sexy eyes.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.621
Eww, she's old enough
to be my mom.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.323
What the hell are you doing?

11:32.325 --> 11:33.858
Are you taking a quaalude?

11:33.860 --> 11:35.493
No.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.628
I'm taking two quaaludes.

11:36.630 --> 11:37.829
Jackass.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.297
What the hell's
wrong with you?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.232
Dude, chill out.
They're not gonna work.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.667
They're practically
as old as she is.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.202
If they do work,

11:44.204 --> 11:45.870
You're gonna want to [...]
everything that walks,

11:45.872 --> 11:48.573
Including her, and i'm
pretty sure she can't walk.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.808
Thank god for that.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.676
Otherwise, things
might get weird.

11:51.678 --> 11:52.877
I'm starving.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.145
I'm going to get
some real food.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.146
That is food.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.514
That's grapes and nuts.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.349
That's like bird food.
I want some meat.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.751
Go over here to one
of these barrels.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.052
Excuse me, gents.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.821
Don't forget to come in
right at the top

12:02.823 --> 12:04.589
- Of the second verse, okay?
- I'm not gonna forget.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.191
Relax, dad.
She's gonna love it.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.192
- You think so?
- Yes.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.493
Hey.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.328
What's up?

12:10.330 --> 12:11.696
I just, uh...

12:11.698 --> 12:14.065
Your stepdad,
he, um...

12:14.067 --> 12:16.000
- What?
- What?

12:16.002 --> 12:17.602
I finished my
documentary interview.

12:17.604 --> 12:18.837
I stood up.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.238
He thanked me.
He hugged me.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.573
He grabbed my ass,

12:21.575 --> 12:22.774
And then he gave me
his number.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.375
What?

12:24.377 --> 12:26.010
Jesus christ.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.011
Come on.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.113
He grabbed your ass?

12:30.617 --> 12:32.117
Hey, did you make a pass
at flash?

12:32.119 --> 12:33.451
Yes, i did.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.019
He's a very handsome
and strapping man.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.020
And you know what?

12:36.022 --> 12:37.288
He smells delicious.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.424
Musky like a--
like a big tree,

12:39.426 --> 12:40.391
Like a huge golden oak.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.460
[laughs]

12:42.462 --> 12:43.862
You remind me so much
of your mother.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.430
You know, if she kicks
the bucket soon,

12:45.432 --> 12:46.531
I may just
make a pass at you.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.732
Eww.

12:47.734 --> 12:48.967
You're my stepfather.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.869
No, i'm your
gay stepfather.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.070
Does my grandmother know?

12:52.072 --> 12:53.538

well, she knows i have

12:53.540 --> 12:55.707

She knows that i have
jerry herman on my speed dial,

12:58.044 --> 12:59.477
And she knows that the thing
that i find

12:59.479 --> 13:01.045
The most attractive
about her face

13:01.047 --> 13:02.280
Is her mustache.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.882
Yeah, i think she has
a couple of clues.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.650
(gigi)
and she's okay with that?

13:05.652 --> 13:07.886

over the moon about it.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.888
I write her a hit show,

13:09.890 --> 13:12.290
I make her life story into
a successful movie,

13:12.292 --> 13:13.958
And her career
finally takes off.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.094

a male companion

13:16.096 --> 13:18.163
For each and every event

13:25.338 --> 13:26.938

- Yeah.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.606
I just pretend
she's morley safer.

Hey, hey.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.121
You ride in on your
high and mighty moral horse

13:43.123 --> 13:44.956
Because you're young,
and you're beautiful,

13:44.958 --> 13:45.957
And you're special.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.759
But believe me,

13:47.761 --> 13:49.928
Once you've been beaten down by
this business for two decades

13:49.930 --> 13:51.429
And you ain't so special

13:51.431 --> 13:53.364
And you're just another
anonymous nobody,

13:53.366 --> 13:58.436
You'll do anything it takes
to get what you want.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.004
Just like me.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.272
You know what?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.941
You're an asshole.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.209
A talented asshole.

i'm not gay.

Yeah, i'm just--
i'm more of a food buff.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.406
That's why i used the word
"sumptuous."

14:35.408 --> 14:36.641
Uh-huh.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.142
Not that the word "sumptuous"
is gay,

14:38.144 --> 14:39.644
'cause it's not.

14:39.646 --> 14:43.047
It's--it's more like,
you know, a food word.

Yes, it is.
I, uh...

14:45.852 --> 14:48.186
