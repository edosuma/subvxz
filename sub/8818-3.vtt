a compliment, right?

21:19.861 --> 21:23.824
- Yes, but, you don't
have to be, you know?

21:23.907 --> 21:26.451
Not always.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.203
- Okay, don't get
too soft on me.

21:28.286 --> 21:29.788
It doesn't suit you.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.498
I mean, it's not
as bad as those preppy shirts

21:31.581 --> 21:33.667
you always wear,
but it's pretty bad.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.335
- Okay, tough guy.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.462
I'll see you around.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.047
Goodnight.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.174
- Goodnight.

21:44.219 --> 21:52.769
- ♪

21:52.853 --> 21:56.565
- Whoa.
This can't be good.

21:58.483 --> 22:13.498
- ♪
