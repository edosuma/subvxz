00:09.809 --> 00:10.833
What do you want?

00:10.910 --> 00:13.378
I want to use my success to help a child.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.778
And I could be a great mother.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.147
I could help them find
what makes them special.

and New York's not too far from here?

00:53.420 --> 00:57.083
I love you, too, Luke, you know that.
But I can't be with you.

You did. You ran the team

- Yeah, but we won four.

But I'm gonna keep it real with you.

Q sucks. And it's all his fault.
I mean, he ain't hit a shot since you left.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.904
- Because they're doubling him.
- No. His hand is messed-up.

I mean, we ice it constantly,
but it just ain't been right

05:44.577 --> 05:46.807
since he punched
that knucklehead over at Tric.

05:46.879 --> 05:50.747

- He said he had it checked out.

cost him a scholarship.

- Daddy said you were on a ship.

- Did you see any pirates?
- Yeah, I saw a couple of pirate ships,

- But...
- But what? Am I in trouble?

07:09.429 --> 07:12.728
No. I was actually thinking that

07:12.799 --> 07:16.132
you are way too valuable
to just be my assistant anymore.

07:16.202 --> 07:21.970

12:22.241 --> 12:24.675
- I want you to palm these.
- Please.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.678
- There. You happy?
- Not quite.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.242
Palm the balls and hold them there.

12:35.855 --> 12:39.689
- For how long?
- I don't know, 30 seconds.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.125
Shouldn't be a problem, right?

12:42.194 --> 12:45.288

I might be getting a promotion

14:01.907 --> 14:04.205
What? Why?

14:04.910 --> 14:09.244
Before I got the job at the local station,
I sent audition tapes everywhere.

14:09.315 --> 14:13.945
There's a good station in Omaha
and they saw the Ravens feature I did

14:14.019 --> 14:16.010
and they're offering me a job.

14:16.088 --> 14:18.886
- In Nebraska?
- Yeah.

14:18.958 --> 14:23.486
The nearest Clothes Over Bro's location
to Omaha is this one.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.154
Yeah, I figured.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.625
Well, is it really that much better
than where you're at, Marvin?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.330
I mean, like you said,
you've already done one feature here,

14:32.404 --> 14:34.372
- maybe you'll get to do more.
- Maybe, but,

14:34.440 --> 14:36.738
it was really just 'cause
they were in a bind.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.744
This would be a full-time on-air position.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.975
It's a small market
but it's a great opportunity.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.608
- You should take it.
- But I...

then you should take it.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.387
- I don't think it's that easy.
- Why not?

Well, because
you're part of my dream, too.

but I love being with you

15:00.933 --> 15:04.369

we had a future. Together.

Did I freak you out?

15:09.975 --> 15:12.409
- Freaked you out, didn't I?
- No.

There is no way those words could've
been too early. Not coming from you.

Just promise me that if you do take
the job that I can have your room,

And took him away
so you could never see him again?

- Yeah.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.654
- What'd he say?
- Whatever. He's gonna come over later

20:28.727 --> 20:32.094
and we're gonna talk about it
or fight about it, but it doesn't matter,

20:32.164 --> 20:34.564
because baby and Brooke
are gonna be fine.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.329
Yeah, I think baby and Brooke needs
a little explanation.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.030
Like, who, when and how, for starters.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.869
Okay, so the adoption agency
has this program

20:42.941 --> 20:45.501
where babies from other countries
who need major surgeries and stuff

20:45.577 --> 20:48.478
come over to the US and doctors
donate their time to fix them up

20:48.547 --> 20:49.844
and then they go home.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.314
- Oh, cool.
- That's great.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.510
It's kind of a whenever-they-can-
squeeze-you-in sort of thing

20:53.585 --> 20:57.021
and the agency had a family, that
was supposed to host the baby, drop out,

20:57.089 --> 21:01.219
so they said
this could be a great trial run for me.

21:01.293 --> 21:02.521
- When does the baby show up?
- Is it a boy or girl?

21:02.594 --> 21:05.392
- Where are his parents, the poor thing?
- And are his parents coming, too?

21:05.464 --> 21:08.729
She's a girl. And she gets here tomorrow.
Her parents don't come with her.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.394
And they didn't tell me what's wrong
with her. They're just sort of gonna

21:11.470 --> 21:14.633
hand her over and we go from there.
And check it out.

21:14.706 --> 21:18.267
I got her a purple monkey
like the one I used to have.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.239
That's so cute.
Did you get her anything else?

21:22.314 --> 21:25.408
Yeah. I got all of this stuff.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.817
- I mean, like, you know, food.
- Or, I mean, a crib?

21:28.887 --> 21:31.617
And stuff.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.885
I got a little sidetracked.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.190

go through some of Jamie's old things.

21:37.262 --> 21:38.286

- Yes.

- Come on, you purple monkey.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.600
Yeah, he said that on the phone.

25:39.671 --> 25:44.665
Look, did he send you over here
to talk to me? Are we in junior high now?

25:44.743 --> 25:48.201
He didn't send me over.
And he's not coming by, either.

25:49.381 --> 25:54.580
- Then why did you?
- Well, I'm taking off.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.679
Thought I'd say goodbye
and congratulations,

25:57.756 --> 26:00.884
and maybe I want to see
your face one more time.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.396
Probably why Owen's not coming by.

26:07.432 --> 26:09.491
What is that supposed to mean?

26:09.568 --> 26:12.799
Well, he probably figures if he looked
into those eyes one more time,

26:12.871 --> 26:15.704
he'll cave on the whole
independence thing.

26:17.576 --> 26:21.034
Anyways, call me if you need anything.

26:21.112 --> 26:25.515
Someone to talk to, new carpets.
I don't know, a husband.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.261
Hey, Brooke?

26:40.932 --> 26:43.628
Don't take the Owen stuff too personally.

26:43.702 --> 26:48.139
- I won't.
- Yeah, you will. I know how you are.

26:48.206 --> 26:52.768
But it's just a big deal. It's kids.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.106
I mean, I know it's just one,

26:54.179 --> 26:57.478
but if you really want a family,
something that's like forever,

26:57.549 --> 26:59.244
forever scares a lot of us.

26:59.317 --> 27:02.411

27:03.622 --> 27:08.719

27:10.795 --> 27:13.093
<i>No one's aware</i>

27:16.935 --> 27:20.132
- Hi.
- Hi. Can I talk to you?

27:20.205 --> 27:21.832
Sure. Come on in.

27:22.607 --> 27:24.666
What's wrong?

27:24.743 --> 27:27.439
Maybe nothing, I hope.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.946
Okay, just have a seat. What's up?

27:30.015 --> 27:33.416
Well, I think I'll stand.
Actually, do you have something to drink?

27:33.485 --> 27:36.420
Some water or an apple martini
with a cherry, if you have it?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.285
Okay, you're kind of freaking me out.

27:38.356 --> 27:40.347
Last time someone
entered the apartment like this,

27:40.425 --> 27:43.019
it was Skills
and he thought he'd killed Chester.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.118
Jamie's bunny?

27:44.195 --> 27:47.858
Yeah, but it turns out he was just like
a really heavy sleeper, apparently.

27:47.932 --> 27:50.162
Well, it's not that, it's just...

27:50.235 --> 27:52.635
I know I sort of freaked you out
when you asked me to stay here

27:52.704 --> 27:55.036
and, well, there's a reason.

27:55.106 --> 27:57.939
- Great. I knew it.
- What?

27:58.009 --> 27:59.909
I figured this was just too good to be true.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.173
There's just a reason
we can't sleep in the same bed.

28:02.247 --> 28:04.215
- Oh, no.
- What?

28:04.282 --> 28:05.874
This is like <i>The Crying Game,</i> right?

28:05.950 --> 28:07.247
- Marvin.
- Hairy back?

28:07.318 --> 28:09.309
- Marvin.
- Well, it's either that or

28:09.387 --> 28:11.787
you're completely repulsed by me.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.397
I'm a virgin.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.126
- Really?
- Yes.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.330
And considering your last gross boss-lady
hook-up, you're clearly not,

28:27.405 --> 28:31.307
- and I am just not ready to...
- How did I find you?

28:31.376 --> 28:33.640
- What?
- Such a perfect girl

28:33.712 --> 28:37.808
who's smart and sweet and so awesome.

28:39.617 --> 28:40.641
Go on.

28:40.719 --> 28:44.155
Millie, I would never
pressure you about sex, I just...

28:44.222 --> 28:47.350
- I wanna be with you.
- But...

28:47.425 --> 28:49.552
I mean, we can even get
two beds if you want.

28:49.627 --> 28:53.620
Although, if I catch you
sneaking into mine, I'm telling Skills.

28:54.666 --> 28:58.432
I am so into you and I want you here.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.198
Will you say yes?

29:03.408 --> 29:07.708
Okay. Yes. If you think it can work.

29:07.779 --> 29:09.906
It can. It does.

29:19.657 --> 29:23.684
So I see you know CPR
and you're also a lifeguard.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.593
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

29:25.663 --> 29:28.131
You ever kissed any of
the husbands you worked for?

Well, sorry.

29:43.314 --> 29:48.047
So Nathan, Haley tells me you like to
watch your nanny swim naked in the pool?

29:51.256 --> 29:53.156
I guess I deserve that.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.530
Hey, Brooke. You okay?

30:02.700 --> 30:07.034
- I think I made a big mistake.
- I think it's a little late for that, isn't it?

30:07.105 --> 30:09.938
If I wanted "a little late for that,"
I would've called Peyton.

30:10.008 --> 30:15.071
You are supposed to say,
"No, you didn't. You're gonna be fine."

30:15.146 --> 30:17.671
No, you didn't. You're gonna be fine.

30:26.691 --> 30:29.421
- You remember that?
- Of course.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.928
I do know some things about you,
Brooke Davis.

30:31.996 --> 30:35.796
- And you're gonna be a great mom.
- I'm not even going to be a mom.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.529
They'll just fix her up
and then I have to send her back.

30:38.603 --> 30:41.197
Well, if you didn't do it, who would?

30:41.539 --> 30:42.665
Hmm?

30:44.275 --> 30:47.836
Owen thinks I'm being selfish.
He thinks I just want what I want.

30:47.912 --> 30:50.073
- Well, I'd say it's the opposite.
- Right?

30:50.148 --> 30:52.673
I think it's great that you're willing
to help this little girl

30:52.750 --> 30:56.481
get the care that she needs
and get to the rest of her life.

30:56.554 --> 30:59.785
So do I.
But what if I do something wrong, Luke?

30:59.858 --> 31:03.988
What if I hurt her? What if I break her?
I mean, I rushed into this and I'm scared.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.222
Okay, you know what?

31:05.296 --> 31:09.232
When it comes to single moms,
I had a pretty special one.

31:09.300 --> 31:13.737
And it's good that you're a little scared.
But you're gonna do great.

- Too soon.
- All right.

The truth is, I just want Jamie
all to myself right now.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.687
But I also want my job,
and I want my music

32:03.755 --> 32:06.223
and I want alone time with you.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.055
You should take a break from that.
Let me go through those things.

32:09.127 --> 32:13.291
I'll try to find a person that's really ugly

you might want to get a workout in.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.638
we should focus
on the things that we love, so...

- Probably really gonna suck, you know.
- You gotta find out sometime, right?
