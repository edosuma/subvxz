00:01.160 --> 00:03.359
On this episode of MythBusters,

00:03.360 --> 00:04.859
buckle up for thrills,

00:04.860 --> 00:08.959
spills and chills.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.469
I can't feel my fingers.

00:10.470 --> 00:15.180
First, Adam and Jamie go all
out for some spy car combat...

00:15.310 --> 00:17.669
Oh I got you, oh yeah.
You want some of this?

00:17.670 --> 00:19.910
...testing whether wheels of misfortune...

00:20.435 --> 00:22.435
Ha-ha! That enough for ya?

00:22.490 --> 00:25.749
...and hood-mounted
machine guns really work.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.830
Is this what you want, man?
I can follow you.

00:29.510 --> 00:32.700
Meanwhile, Kari, Grant
and Tory get in a spin...

00:32.725 --> 00:33.925
MythBusters on ice.

00:34.850 --> 00:38.029
...as they find out if a bullet
fired into a frozen lake

00:38.030 --> 00:41.200
can really spin like a top.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.870
See, there is no string here.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.950
It's a story that starts
in San Francisco...

00:46.670 --> 00:48.889
I don't see any spinning bullet.

00:48.890 --> 00:54.120
...but ends in a bitter battle, as the
MythBusters take on Mother Nature.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.160
The next myth is in the Bahamas, right?

00:59.510 --> 01:01.510
Who are the MythBusters?

01:01.790 --> 01:02.800
Adam Savage...

01:02.801 --> 01:03.964
Wow!

01:03.990 --> 01:05.980
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:06.420 --> 01:08.529
Alright, it's party time.

01:08.530 --> 01:12.569
Between them, more than 30 years
of special effects experience.

01:12.570 --> 01:14.370
Joining them,

01:14.770 --> 01:16.369
Grant Imahara...

01:16.370 --> 01:17.370
For science.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.659
...Kari Byron...

01:19.684 --> 01:20.884
Right tool for the job.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.000
...and Tory Belleci.

01:24.230 --> 01:26.229
They don't just tell the myths.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.560
They put them to the test.

01:28.585 --> 01:32.085

01:35.580 --> 01:38.970
First up, buckle up for
some Spy Car Carnage.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.439
Spy car revenge.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.380
Spy car revenge?

01:42.810 --> 01:45.569
Yeah, the original "Spy Car"
was all about defensive weapons

01:45.570 --> 01:49.329
a spy might have in his car that
could foil someone who's chasing him.

01:49.330 --> 01:52.379
Spy car revenge is about offensive weapons

01:52.380 --> 01:56.229
a chaser would have to
disable a car he's chasing.

01:56.230 --> 01:57.630
What do you have in mind?

01:57.700 --> 01:58.520
I got two things.

01:58.521 --> 02:01.939
The first one: spiky things that
come out of the hubs of their wheels

02:01.940 --> 02:05.089
and tear up their opponents'
cars while they're driving next to them.

02:05.090 --> 02:06.929
Nice. What's the other one?

02:06.930 --> 02:10.889
Guns mounted on the hood of the spy's car.

02:11.390 --> 02:12.979
That is very cool.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.330
- Let's start with the spikes first.
- Okay.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.470
Okay, guys, I'm all oiled up
and ready to go.

02:18.551 --> 02:23.520
In "Spy Car" round one, the
guys evaluated evasion antics,

02:24.840 --> 02:26.540
with mixed success.

02:31.800 --> 02:37.740
But this time, it's out with
escape and in with attack.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.320
But can hood-mounted guns

02:40.800 --> 02:46.220
and hub-mounted wheel spikes
really work first time every time?

02:48.460 --> 02:50.019
So, wheel spikes.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.519
There are tons of movies
that have used that trick.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.418
We can't do all of them.

02:53.419 --> 02:54.280
No, we can't.

02:54.281 --> 02:56.799
I think we should boil
it down and pick two.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.790
Well, there is a classic in "Goldfinger",

02:58.793 --> 03:00.799
it's really simple.
We gotta do that one.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.839
And there is a really
pretty nicely complex one

03:03.840 --> 03:05.168
in "The Green Hornet" I'd like to try out.

03:05.169 --> 03:06.440
Sounds like we've got a plan.

03:06.441 --> 03:07.490
I think we do.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.369
And it's a plan that starts with a delivery

03:11.370 --> 03:13.859
for MythBusters' very own cue.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.820
This car is gonna be our chase car.

03:16.370 --> 03:20.219
When I'm done with it, it's gonna
be a vicious and aggressive car.

03:20.220 --> 03:23.379
In fact, I think I'm going
to call it "Slash",

03:23.380 --> 03:25.310
because that's what it's gonna do.

03:25.660 --> 03:27.789
With Slash sitting pretty,

03:27.790 --> 03:31.320
Jamie begins by building the
first of the two wheel spikes,

03:31.470 --> 03:33.940
the deadly device from "Goldfinger".

03:35.330 --> 03:36.590
It's pretty simple, really.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.289
All it has is a blender-style blade

03:39.290 --> 03:41.580
like this one that I cut
out on the plasma cutter,

03:41.581 --> 03:43.529
attached to the end of the post.

03:43.530 --> 03:46.189
So I will weld on this one here like so,

03:46.190 --> 03:49.870
weld on the hub piece and
then sharpen the blades.

03:50.450 --> 03:53.069
As slashers go, it's certainly simple.

03:53.070 --> 03:54.909
Looks about right to me.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.439
But will the chromoly
steel be strong enough

03:57.440 --> 03:59.310
to not buckle under pressure?

03:59.311 --> 04:00.514
Auch!

04:00.540 --> 04:04.140
Meanwhile, tire slasher two
is anything but basic.

04:04.850 --> 04:07.199
"The Green Hornet" device
is a little more complicated.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.649
It has a bunch of spiky finger-like things

04:09.650 --> 04:12.169
that are welded to a central hub like so.

04:12.170 --> 04:16.410
Now I've mocked all this up in wood,
so that I can get the geometry right.

04:17.010 --> 04:21.149
And then, all I have to do is cut a bunch
of steel pieces out like this,

04:21.149 --> 04:25.090
weld them all together, and I'm done.

04:25.530 --> 04:28.779
In that case, let's cut
to the chase, literally.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.140
You ready to do this?

04:31.050 --> 04:33.040
Are you ready to get slashed up?

04:33.700 --> 04:35.610
Ha ha! You just try and catch me.

04:39.490 --> 04:42.120
Enjoy it while it lasts, buddy.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.789
While Adam spins out for no
reason other than because he can,

04:47.790 --> 04:50.470
Jamie gets on with the odd job in hand,

04:50.840 --> 04:54.099
attaching the "Goldfinger Slinger".

04:54.100 --> 04:55.410
This blade looks pretty nasty.

04:55.411 --> 04:58.159
And I'm positive it will
take out Adam's tire.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.169
But when it comes to meeting
something stronger,

05:00.170 --> 05:05.129
like his wheel or steel parts
of the body, I'm not so sure,

05:05.130 --> 05:09.299
because this is a pretty long lever,
and that means it can get bent.

05:09.300 --> 05:13.299
With that in mind I did make
this out of chromoly steel,

05:13.300 --> 05:15.089
which is very, very strong.

05:15.090 --> 05:18.779
But what it actually does, we're
just gonna have to try and find out.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.740
And to do just that, the
guys are establishing

05:20.741 --> 05:24.559
some very precise rules of engagement.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.369
This story is all about how much damage
Jamie's spikes will do to my car.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.259
I'm not going to avoid him.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.760
I'm going to drive at a constant speed,

05:31.761 --> 05:34.920
while he pulls up and does
as much damage as he can.

05:35.480 --> 05:40.269
So from the green flag, the two cars
will accelerate to 40 miles an hour.

05:40.270 --> 05:41.710
When they hit the red flag,

05:41.711 --> 05:45.139
Jamie will engage the weapon
into the driver side of my car.

05:45.140 --> 05:49.140
He will have 500 yards to inflict
as much damage as he can.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.339
My prediction, I don't think his
Goldfinger spike is gonna do

05:53.340 --> 05:55.559
much more than carve up the side of my car.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.460
I don't think it's gonna take me out.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.219
Dude, nice Goldfinger spikes.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.289
- Pretty nasty, huh?
- Totally.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.310
Are you ready for it?

06:07.311 --> 06:08.720
Absolutely.

06:09.140 --> 06:13.290
With the first spike locked and loaded,
let's get the show on the road.

06:14.070 --> 06:22.470
Okay, Goldfinger spike
in three, two, one...

06:26.300 --> 06:28.069
Both cars accelerate towards

06:28.070 --> 06:30.259
the red flag of the engagement zone.

06:30.260 --> 06:33.440
And once there, the carnage can begin.

06:34.070 --> 06:36.750
Oh, no.

06:37.710 --> 06:41.230
Jamie's first bump tears
through the car door.

06:45.060 --> 06:49.140
The second shreds the tire like a
proverbial knife through butter.

06:53.670 --> 06:58.110
And that loss of traction brings
Adam's car to a slow stop.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.359
You all right there, little buddy?

07:00.360 --> 07:02.009
You totally disabled me.

07:02.010 --> 07:04.719
Meaning that for the
James Bond simple spike,

07:04.720 --> 07:06.990
it's pretty much mission accomplished.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.579
Wow, dude, that is beautiful.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.459
That was crazy effective.

07:13.460 --> 07:16.189
Yeah, it sliced right
through the rear of the car

07:16.190 --> 07:18.499
and went into the tire, no problem.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.470
I have never been in
a purposeful accident...

07:24.320 --> 07:27.609
especially not one where the
person I was driving next to

07:27.610 --> 07:29.489
wanted to cause damage to me.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.960
Oh! That's really scary!

07:31.600 --> 07:33.889
My leg is right on the other side of this.

07:33.890 --> 07:35.140
Check that out.

07:36.030 --> 07:39.839
And it took out this tire magnificently.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.560
I had no idea that this method
would be this effective.

07:44.140 --> 07:47.860
Test one's low tech specs
was a steely success.

07:48.330 --> 07:51.560
But can its more elaborate
counterpart do any better?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.619
Given the success of the Bond spike,

07:54.620 --> 07:57.099
you'd think that this monster
would be a shoo in.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.969
But I'm not so sure.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.759
It's much more complicated;

08:00.760 --> 08:02.190
there's more step to go wrong.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.400
Sometimes size isn't everything.

08:05.690 --> 08:08.030
But will this be one of those times?

08:08.455 --> 08:09.655
Right.

08:10.630 --> 08:12.900
Well, let's roll test two.

08:13.310 --> 08:16.549
Dude, from here, those spikes look sick.

08:16.550 --> 08:19.369
Well, are you ready to feel the touch?

08:19.370 --> 08:20.530
I'm ready. Let's do it.

08:20.531 --> 08:24.890
Okay, "Green Hornet"
in three, two, one...

08:26.230 --> 08:29.210
Like last time, the guys
carefully accelerate,

08:30.280 --> 08:33.110
because they want to know
if the weapon works,

08:33.360 --> 08:35.510
not how easy it is to deploy.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.818
All right, I'm at cruise
control, going at 40.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.020
Here it comes.

08:42.010 --> 08:42.710
Oh, crap.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.900
Oh, crap.

08:44.010 --> 08:45.260
Oh, no.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.640
"Oh, no" is right.

08:46.780 --> 08:49.019
Any hope that this weapon sting would be

08:49.020 --> 08:51.490
harmless is immediately abandoned.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.610
Oh, crap!

08:56.940 --> 08:57.960
Oh, come on.

08:58.090 --> 08:59.530
Come on. Let's have some more. Come on!

08:59.531 --> 09:04.029
Despite Adam's fighting
talk, one bump later,

09:04.030 --> 09:08.210
and his journey is brought
to a premature end.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.220
What did you do to me?

09:12.340 --> 09:15.820
Another successful destruction. Insane!

09:16.510 --> 09:19.719
I think I'm getting a little
better at this as I practice.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.739
Yeah, you took that tire
out pretty handily.

09:21.740 --> 09:24.899
Yeah, I went in right about
here and started to go back

09:24.900 --> 09:26.980
until I hit the tire and heard the bang.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.329
Awesome.

09:30.330 --> 09:33.450
"The Green Hornet" spike made
mincemeat of Adam's car,

09:33.610 --> 09:37.980
opening it up like a sardine can,
and shredding the tire to pieces.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.450
But Jamie's not convinced.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.999
Personally, I think this one is more
showy than anything else, I mean,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.579
It did take out of the tire and
it messed up the side of the car,

09:48.580 --> 09:51.970
but it really didn't do any more
damage than the Bond one did.

09:52.370 --> 09:53.540
Jamie's got a point,

09:53.670 --> 09:57.110
because both wheel spikes did
more or less the same damage.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.020
That felt like I got hit by a power tool!

10:00.130 --> 10:02.850
And both brought Adam to a complete stop.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.400
I lost all power.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.319
But Jamie thinks there
is room for improvement.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.660
Both of our movie spikes work pretty well.
The thing is,

10:09.820 --> 10:13.120
they are really pretty much
just fancy tire poppers,

10:13.280 --> 10:17.040
because who cares if you put scratches
or holes in the sheet metal?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.820
It's not really gonna stop the car.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.680
It makes me wonder though what would.

10:22.380 --> 10:26.890
And that's a thought that should
have Adam very, very afraid.

10:28.150 --> 10:31.719
Still to come, Jamie's
wonder turns to thunder.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.560
You are one sick puppy.

10:34.370 --> 10:36.810
That is messed up.

10:36.930 --> 10:40.900
But next, will a bullet fired
into ice spin like a top?

10:41.050 --> 10:44.020
All right, this is a spinning
bullet at 42 degrees.

10:51.490 --> 10:54.170
Next up, it's time to spin out.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.968
Okay, so our next myth is

10:57.969 --> 11:00.150
based on a video clip that
was sent in by a viewer.

11:00.151 --> 11:01.669
And it's kind of weird.

11:01.670 --> 11:02.858
You still have the video?

11:02.859 --> 11:03.680
I want to see it.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.230
Okay, not like that.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.010
There is a guy on a frozen lake bed

11:07.080 --> 11:10.069
with a bunch of his buddies,
shooting a nine mill into the ice.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.779
And somehow, they get their bullets
to just spin like a top.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.409
Now that sounds like a myth.

11:15.410 --> 11:17.150
That is exactly why we're testing it.

11:18.820 --> 11:23.459
It's no myth that a bullet
fired from a handgun

11:23.460 --> 11:25.700
spins at over 80,000 RPM.

11:26.200 --> 11:32.570
But can a bullet fired into a
frozen lake really spin like a top?

11:32.990 --> 11:34.639
See, there is no string here.

11:34.640 --> 11:40.490
In other words, is this video the real
deal or is this myth on thin ice?

11:41.170 --> 11:42.980
Look, I gotta say I got
my doubts about this one.

11:42.981 --> 11:46.259
Yeah, I know this looks pretty bizarre,
but I think it's worth testing.

11:46.260 --> 11:46.958
I agree.

11:46.959 --> 11:48.738
But where are we gonna
find a frozen lake bed?

11:48.739 --> 11:49.868
It's the middle of summer.

11:49.869 --> 11:51.280
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

11:51.281 --> 11:54.279
And I think we've gotta
build our own frozen lake.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.099
We've done crazier.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.240
Yeah, we should definitely
try two different shots.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.979
Maybe we shoot one directly into the
ice, and then one as a ricochet

12:01.980 --> 12:03.798
and see if one of those
gives us a spinning bullet.

12:03.799 --> 12:04.870
Okay, let's do it.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.930
But before anyone spins out,

12:08.520 --> 12:11.850
Tory's getting to grips with
a gun-grip, or ransom rest,

12:11.920 --> 12:14.700
because for this myth, geometry is key.

12:16.050 --> 12:19.779
Now if this myth is true, the
key element here is finding out

12:19.780 --> 12:21.859
which angle to fire the gun into the ice.

12:21.860 --> 12:24.730
So I have my gun, I have my ransom rest.

12:24.860 --> 12:27.250
Now what I need to do is
build a holder that is

12:27.360 --> 12:30.270
adjustable so we can fire at
the ice at different angles.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.139
Finding the right angle is vital.

12:33.140 --> 12:36.719
Too straight and the bullet
will deform, and not spin.

12:36.720 --> 12:41.590
Too shallow, and the slug will skip
off the ice and be lost forever.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.730
Now, I found out a little bit more
about the shooter in the myth.

12:44.820 --> 12:48.619
He was about six feet tall, and shot
about six feet in front of him.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.279
So since Tory is six feet tall,

12:50.280 --> 12:51.998
I'm going to have him stand
in for the shooter...

12:51.999 --> 12:53.760
Okay, Tory, put your
feet right at the line.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.340
...and have him hold
the gun and aim at six feet.

12:57.460 --> 13:00.619
Here is a laser pointer to help
you find the six foot mark.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.749
Then I'm going to check
the angle of the gun,

13:02.750 --> 13:04.440
and the distance it is from the ground.

13:04.441 --> 13:07.129
Okay, that is about 42 degrees.

13:07.130 --> 13:09.589
And let's see what the height is...

13:09.590 --> 13:12.619
about 44 1/2 inches.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.499
With that information, we can put
our ransom rest in the right place

13:15.500 --> 13:16.988
to get the results we are looking for.

13:16.989 --> 13:18.918
Now, we know where to set the ransom rest.

13:18.919 --> 13:20.090
- Well, at least where to start.
- Yeah.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.439
Knowing where to start is a start.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.509
And with a shooting rig ready to fire,

13:25.510 --> 13:27.610
they are off to take aim at this myth.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.029
We are on the rifle range
at Chabot Gun Club,

13:31.030 --> 13:34.840
so we can recreate the circumstances
of the spinning ice bullet.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.340
In the myth, this event takes place

13:37.350 --> 13:39.769
on a frozen pond in the middle of winter.

13:39.770 --> 13:43.869
But because it's the middle of summer
and we're in Northern California,

13:43.870 --> 13:47.119
frozen ponds are not in plentiful supply.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.270
All right, bring in the ice.

13:48.271 --> 13:51.519
But what we're going to
do is create our own,

13:51.520 --> 13:57.399
using nine forty inch by twenty-four
inch by ten inch thick solid ice blocks.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.610
Okay, there we go.

13:58.611 --> 14:00.010
"MythBusters" on ice.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.449
All right, maybe not.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.619
Putting those all together, and hopefully

14:05.620 --> 14:08.639
that amount of mass will be
enough to create a spin.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.309
It's certainly a large slice of ice,

14:11.310 --> 14:14.020
and the next best thing to a frozen lake.

14:14.470 --> 14:16.680
Is it bad if you can't
feel your fingertips?

14:17.100 --> 14:19.050
They said this would be a cool myth.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.560
I didn't believe them.

14:21.790 --> 14:24.560
Look at that, instant frozen lake.

14:24.690 --> 14:27.120
- I wouldn't say instant.
- Good point.

14:27.230 --> 14:30.020
So you'll notice that
we've set up a frozen lake

14:30.030 --> 14:31.890
with a smaller ice cube in front of it.

14:31.891 --> 14:34.109
Now that's because if you watch the video,

14:34.110 --> 14:37.469
it's hard to tell if the bullet
spins on the direct hit on the ice

14:37.470 --> 14:38.820
or via ricochet.

14:38.990 --> 14:42.089
In other words, does it hit and spin,

14:42.090 --> 14:44.570
or does it hit, bounce, land
somewhere else, and then spin.

14:44.571 --> 14:47.580
Well, in search of said spin,

14:47.720 --> 14:50.490
the team is first going for
the direct hit approach,

14:50.610 --> 14:53.560
firing straight into the
ice cube with this...

14:53.900 --> 14:56.629
What I have here is a Glock 9 millimeter.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.669
Now this is the gun
apparently used in the myth.

14:59.670 --> 15:01.080
We are about to fire a bullet

15:01.081 --> 15:04.279
into the ice to see if it'll
actually spin like a top.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.589
I can't wait to see what happens.

15:06.590 --> 15:10.950
The Glock is positioned in Tori's
angle finder to 42 degrees

15:11.150 --> 15:13.220
and then it's go time.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.669
Okay, so, we are gonna fire,

15:15.670 --> 15:19.269
and then look and listen for
any sort of spinning bullet.

15:19.270 --> 15:22.469
All right, this is spinning
bullet at 42 degrees.

15:22.470 --> 15:25.380
In three, two, one...

15:27.850 --> 15:29.119
The gun fires.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.130
The ice shatters.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.140
But what happens to the bullet?

15:32.290 --> 15:35.360
Well, we hit the ice, but
no spinning bullet.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.860
Look how much it fractured!

15:36.980 --> 15:38.190
I bet it's right in there.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.300
Kari is spot on.

15:40.460 --> 15:44.489
The bullet hit the ice and simply
embedded itself deep inside,

15:44.490 --> 15:46.650
where a spin is out of the question.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.410
But undeterred, the MythBusters
decide to try again.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.040
All right. The gun is loaded. We're hot.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.299
Let's do this.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.820
Round two, three, two, one...

16:02.800 --> 16:05.060
It's another 42 degree hit...

16:06.530 --> 16:07.790
...but with the same result.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.320
I don't see any spinning bullets.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.810
But all is not lost.

16:13.230 --> 16:14.919
Ok, we are 0 for 2.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.220
But you know what? That is fine.

16:16.221 --> 16:18.839
Because it doesn't always
work in the viral video.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.329
Not every shot yields a spin.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.330
So we can't call it just yet.

16:24.090 --> 16:26.770
In three, two, one...

16:27.390 --> 16:30.930
Test three also has nothing akin to a spin.

16:31.620 --> 16:36.589
But when they recover the round, there
is cause for cautious optimism.

16:36.590 --> 16:37.560
Oh, my gosh.

16:37.700 --> 16:38.820
Look at this.

16:39.490 --> 16:42.010
The bullet has not deformed,

16:42.170 --> 16:44.300
which means there might
be some truth to this myth.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.180
That could potentially spin.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.800
But with test four...

16:47.825 --> 16:50.969
Where is the elusive spinning bullet?

16:51.370 --> 16:52.570
...five,...

16:52.595 --> 16:53.795
It's not here.

16:54.410 --> 17:00.750
...six and seven also failing to spin
out, that optimism soon melts away.

17:00.930 --> 17:02.050
The sun is coming out.

17:02.200 --> 17:06.950
The lake is melting,
still no spinning bullet.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.690
Meaning it's time for a plan "B".

17:10.160 --> 17:13.329
So the direct hit experiment
isn't really giving us anything.

17:13.329 --> 17:16.550
So we're going to change our firing
angle and try for the ricochet.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.690
We are going to fire into the ice block

17:18.691 --> 17:21.419
and hope to catch a spinning
bullet on a larger frozen lake.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.209
This is not going to be easy.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.409
Coming right up
in "Spy car - the revenge"...

17:26.410 --> 17:28.890
I think that would hurt another
car if you drove into it.

17:28.891 --> 17:31.659
...will Jamie be psyched by his spike?

17:31.660 --> 17:32.830
The slasher.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.570
In three, two, one...

17:43.700 --> 17:48.030
So far in the spy spike department,
we tested the Goldfinger spike...

17:51.110 --> 17:53.750
...which did this kind of damage.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.799
We have also tested
the Green Hornet spike...

17:59.800 --> 18:00.690
Oh, crap.

18:01.710 --> 18:03.940
...which did this kind of damage.

18:05.900 --> 18:11.180
Now, apparently, Jamie has rigged up
some kind of special Hyneman sauce

18:11.320 --> 18:13.260
to come at me with one last time.

18:13.370 --> 18:16.380
Even though Adam was
psyched by the spikes...

18:16.405 --> 18:17.489
I'm going home.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.730
...Jamie saw room for improvement.

18:20.570 --> 18:23.160
I don't think he's gonna make it very far.

18:23.270 --> 18:27.660
So he slipped back to the shop to
conjure up a wheel of misfortune

18:29.150 --> 18:31.990
straight from the Hyneman House of Horrors.

18:33.330 --> 18:35.660
I think that'd hurt another
car if you drove into it.

18:36.380 --> 18:40.179
And back at the runway,
with nuts tightened,

18:40.180 --> 18:42.090
it's time to put it to the test.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.150
This design is about the worst
thing I could come up with.

18:45.151 --> 18:47.559
What's different about it is that

18:47.560 --> 18:50.929
the other designs all had
relatively long skinny shafts

18:50.930 --> 18:52.360
with a cutting blade on the tip.

18:52.361 --> 18:54.719
And those shafts could bend.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.819
The little blades around the tip could also

18:57.820 --> 18:59.860
bend or go relatively easily, and they did.

19:00.020 --> 19:06.020
Whereas this has this massive
base, that's very strong,

19:06.160 --> 19:10.479
so I reckon this will go right into
the car and just keep on cutting

19:10.480 --> 19:12.319
without damaging itself.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.850
- Are you ready?
- I am.

19:13.980 --> 19:19.720
Okay, the slasher, in three, two, one...

19:21.850 --> 19:25.250
For the final time, the MythBusters
motor down the runway,

19:27.390 --> 19:31.200
until the red flag signals
the bullish Jamie to charge.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.990
Straight away, he takes
out Adam's rear tire.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.600
Then he slices and dices
along the whole side.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.440
Come on, Jamie, I can take more!

19:49.760 --> 19:53.360
With Adam at his mercy,
Jamie goes in for the kill.

19:55.650 --> 19:57.029
Not enough for you?

19:57.030 --> 20:00.579
...and rips the entire
front tire clean off...

20:00.580 --> 20:02.230
Had enough?

20:03.290 --> 20:05.860
...leaving only one possible outcome.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.800
That was too much fun.

20:10.730 --> 20:14.370
That fulfills like a deep
childhood fantasy.

20:14.740 --> 20:16.329
I want another car.

20:16.330 --> 20:17.720
I want to do this again.

20:18.170 --> 20:22.159
It was a heavy metal massacre in
the truest sense of the word.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.390
I got to see this.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.190
I think I messed your car up a little bit.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.560
I'm sorry about that.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.039
I don't know what I was thinking.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.420
That is a horror sight.

20:37.660 --> 20:39.180
Where's my tire?

20:39.330 --> 20:41.210
My tire... is not... oh, there it is!

20:41.235 --> 20:43.035
I'd say my spike was pretty effective.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.618
I mean there is not a whole lot more

20:44.619 --> 20:46.870
that you can do to the side of a car.

20:46.920 --> 20:51.050
Not only did I pop the tires,
but I completely removed them.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.080
The car can't move at all now,

20:54.210 --> 20:57.120
because the chassis is sitting
on the ground in fact.

20:58.660 --> 21:00.780
It worked a little better
than I thought it would.

21:01.780 --> 21:04.620
With spy myth one a slashing success,

21:04.770 --> 21:07.560
it's time to bring out the big guns.

21:12.690 --> 21:15.590
Is this firearm's film the real deal,

21:16.810 --> 21:18.480
or just bullet baloney?

21:18.680 --> 21:21.630
Can a slug really spin like a frozen top?

21:22.610 --> 21:24.690
Three, two, one...

21:25.070 --> 21:28.720
Well, the MythBusters direct
hit approach was shot down.

21:29.010 --> 21:30.990
I don't see any spinning bullet.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.470
So it's time to modify the method.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.930
So far, the direct shot did not work.

21:37.110 --> 21:39.060
So we are going to move on to the ricochet,

21:39.240 --> 21:42.130
which brings into play our
larger frozen lake bed.

21:42.310 --> 21:44.390
What we are going to do is lower
the angle of the shot,

21:44.480 --> 21:48.530
hopefully allowing the bullet to skip off
the ice on to our frozen lake bed,

21:48.570 --> 21:50.680
and we'll see if we can
get that bullet spinning.

21:50.900 --> 21:55.210
We actually have information from
the guy who supposedly did this.

21:55.500 --> 22:00.060
What he told us is that every time
he tried it, the bullet landed between

22:00.250 --> 22:03.840
two and eight feet from the
point of impact with the ice.

22:04.320 --> 22:08.750
We have a ten foot slab of ice out there.

22:08.950 --> 22:10.160
Sounds easy?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.600
It won't be.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.800
Well, to find out, they are starting

22:14.000 --> 22:17.270
by using a ricochet-friendly
angle of 30 degrees.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.100
Hoping this works.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.160
In three, two, one...

22:23.450 --> 22:24.690
It's a clean hit.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.490
But the bullet's gone AWOL.

22:26.670 --> 22:29.450
It's not on the pond, nor in the cube.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.190
Wait a minute, that's good news,

22:31.380 --> 22:32.320
cause the bullet isn't in there.

22:32.530 --> 22:33.650
It did ricochet, I don't
know where it went,

22:33.651 --> 22:35.460
but at least it popped out.

22:35.550 --> 22:36.600
Right.

22:36.910 --> 22:41.080
The high speed confirms that on the
one hand, they did get a ricochet.

22:41.480 --> 22:45.330
But on the other, the bouncing
bullet did not land on their lake.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.900
So, they reset for try two.

22:49.110 --> 22:51.370
All right, let's go before spring comes.

22:53.870 --> 22:56.050
But again, the bullet disappears.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.180
The good news is, we got a ricochet.

22:59.410 --> 23:01.750
The bad news, we can't
find the bullet anywhere.

23:01.950 --> 23:03.340
It's nowhere on the lake bed.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.080
So that's why we have this.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.620
This back board with the white
paper is going to tell us.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.670
If the bullet hits this, we'll
know exactly where it goes.

23:11.470 --> 23:12.100
Alright, we are hot.

23:12.101 --> 23:13.620
That's the theory.

23:13.630 --> 23:14.960
Is this the magic formula?

23:15.150 --> 23:15.970
But in practice...

23:15.995 --> 23:17.195
One!

23:17.800 --> 23:21.160
...even the ricochet catcher
doesn't catch the ricochet.

23:21.380 --> 23:25.120
So it must be firing way
over our back board.

23:25.550 --> 23:28.040
So next, the team wrangles the angle.

23:28.310 --> 23:30.679
But where it be high...

23:30.680 --> 23:33.060
- Alright, we are loaded in 45 degrees.
- One!

23:34.540 --> 23:35.419
...low...

23:35.420 --> 23:36.310
31 degrees.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.509
...or somewhere in between,...

23:38.510 --> 23:41.130
All right, we are locked and loaded
at a 38-degree angle.

23:42.210 --> 23:45.369
...the ricocheting round
never lands on the lake.

23:45.370 --> 23:48.540
And... I don't see a spinning bullet.

23:48.690 --> 23:50.110
I don't see the ricochet at all.

23:50.310 --> 23:52.640
- Anything?
- The back board is clean.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.580
You know, we can be here all day.

23:54.870 --> 23:56.470
We have been here all day.

23:56.850 --> 23:58.690
And what a frustrating day it's been.

23:59.050 --> 24:01.410
But without finding a single ricochet,

24:01.620 --> 24:05.040
it's just not possible to call
the myth one way or the other.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.630
We have been experimenting all day
to find the perfect conditions

24:08.800 --> 24:10.930
to create the mythical spinning bullet.

24:11.110 --> 24:14.020
Now we have the right temperature
of ice, the right hardness.

24:14.090 --> 24:17.480
Unfortunately, we have an
extremely unpredictable ricochet.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.680
We can't find where the bullet lands.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.110
Now, we've created the biggest frozen pond

24:22.111 --> 24:24.429
that we possibly could in summer with

24:24.430 --> 24:26.760
all of the available ice
that we could source.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.360
We need to go bigger.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.780
We need something a little more
naturally huge and frozen.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.074

24:40.170 --> 24:42.060
In "Spy car - the revenge",

24:42.390 --> 24:44.790
wheel spikes were a rip roaring success.

24:45.415 --> 24:46.615
Is that enough for you?

24:46.760 --> 24:50.330
So now it's on to secret
agent anecdote number two.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.250
Car mounted guns?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.380
Yes, I have been saying this for years.

24:55.381 --> 24:58.350
The car mounted guns for a spy
car don't make any sense to me.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.710
They are fixed.

24:59.890 --> 25:02.070
You cannot aim them except by driving.

25:02.260 --> 25:04.690
That's got to be a huge
inefficiency for a machine gun.

25:04.890 --> 25:07.560
Well, I have seen some that are
remote-controlled and aim-able, though.

25:07.670 --> 25:08.870
Those are in the minority,
but I have seen them.

25:09.060 --> 25:11.290
So I think we should build
a rig that gives us both.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.740
I chase you with fixed guns on my hood,

25:13.940 --> 25:15.800
and then we can do a second
one where I chase you

25:15.801 --> 25:19.040
with a remote-controlled aim-able
gun mounted to the hood of my car.

25:19.230 --> 25:20.170
Sold.

25:22.710 --> 25:25.810
The hood mounted gun is a
staple for any spy car.

25:26.050 --> 25:28.000
But is it a viable weapon?

25:28.550 --> 25:33.910
Can such a device, fixed or movable,
really guarantee an accurate aim?

25:37.230 --> 25:41.550
Well, to find out, Adam has already
selected his wheels and his weapon.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.140
This is a former police car.

25:46.320 --> 25:51.820
And this is a super high-end ten
round per second paint ball gun.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.820
I'm going to join these two things together

25:54.020 --> 25:56.690
to make two great tastes in one candy bar.

25:57.430 --> 26:01.160
Fabricating the fixed firearm
will be a weld in the park.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.750
But the remote-controlled
firer is a much tougher task.

26:06.930 --> 26:10.200
So for the aim-able gun, I
need to first build a mount

26:10.400 --> 26:12.590
that will let the gun
move in three dimensions,

26:12.780 --> 26:15.550
so I can fire at Jamie's
car wherever it might be.

26:16.430 --> 26:18.170
There's the basics right there.

26:18.390 --> 26:22.020
Up, down, side to side.

26:22.530 --> 26:24.280
Then I'm going to add a joystick system

26:24.450 --> 26:28.120
so that I can control the gun's aim
from inside the car while driving.

26:28.330 --> 26:29.590
That is X-Y control.

26:29.740 --> 26:31.940
Next comes the all important trigger,

26:32.140 --> 26:34.430
so I'll be able to shoot
600 rounds per minute.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.700
I press this.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.490
It ought to fire.

26:40.310 --> 26:41.390
That is remote firing.

26:41.830 --> 26:44.540
Finally, I'm going to add
a camera onto the mount

26:44.750 --> 26:48.890
and a monitor under the dashboard, so
I can see exactly where I'm aiming.

26:49.290 --> 26:52.770
This camera is what turns this from
something cool into something awesome.

26:54.510 --> 26:55.570
Jamie, come here. Check it out.

26:59.620 --> 27:00.920
In your face!

27:02.640 --> 27:03.580
That looks great.

27:03.830 --> 27:08.610
Actually, I should say, it looks
like crap, but it works great.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.620
And with those words of encouragement,

27:12.240 --> 27:14.640
Adam gets on with the final
part of his firearm.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.950
A frame that should feed a plethora
of paint balls into the gun.

27:23.090 --> 27:25.630
It's not pretty, but will it work?

27:31.460 --> 27:32.240
I got you.

27:32.460 --> 27:33.820
I got you! Oh yeah!

27:34.220 --> 27:34.750
You want some of this?

27:34.920 --> 27:35.930
You want a piece of this?

27:36.120 --> 27:38.290
You want some more? Hey, do you want some?

27:40.230 --> 27:42.250
You so wish you were me right now.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.560
All right, so where do we stand?

27:48.740 --> 27:50.160
Well, we have got two issues.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.960
One, we can't get a spin from a direct hit.

27:53.050 --> 27:55.180
And two, we can't find the ricochet.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.700
Not only that. This is supposed to be easy.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.070
I mean, in the video, the guy
shoots and gets a spinning.

28:00.270 --> 28:01.740
That's not what we found at all.

28:01.950 --> 28:02.750
Not so fast.

28:02.940 --> 28:03.800
Check this out.

28:03.990 --> 28:06.160
You are not gonna believe what we found.

28:06.370 --> 28:08.460
Now, the cameraman was going
through some of the footage.

28:09.580 --> 28:10.410
Now listen.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.310
Can you hear that?

28:15.410 --> 28:18.220
I don't know what that is, but it could
potentially be a spinning bullet.

28:18.390 --> 28:20.150
I mean, we can't see it, but we can
definitely hear something.

28:20.410 --> 28:22.470
Ok, well, that brings this myth
back from the dead.

28:22.670 --> 28:24.260
I think we should
definitely stick to our plan.

28:24.490 --> 28:25.560
And the plan being,

28:25.760 --> 28:29.450
we wait until winter and try this
again on an actual frozen lake,

28:29.660 --> 28:31.070
where we might have
a chance of this working.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.370
All right. Let's reconvene in six months.

28:35.330 --> 28:39.080
From the San Franciscan sun to
a blizzard in the Sierra Nevada,

28:39.510 --> 28:42.420
this winter the team is
going that extra mile.

28:42.850 --> 28:44.050
Save yourselves.

28:45.130 --> 28:47.340
Rumor has it, there is a lake out here.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.090
I think it's over there.

28:49.470 --> 28:52.440
This looked a little more
picturesque in the brochures.

28:53.070 --> 28:55.320
All right, so what we have
behind me is a frozen lake.

28:55.670 --> 28:57.140
I know it doesn't really look like it.

28:57.141 --> 28:58.830
It looks more like a snow field.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.420
We are at 7900 feet.

29:01.590 --> 29:03.320
The temperature is 10 degrees.

29:03.550 --> 29:06.780
This is exactly what we
need to test this myth.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.940
The only problem is we're in
the middle of a snowstorm.

29:10.510 --> 29:11.860
And I'm freezing my %$& off.

29:12.140 --> 29:14.020
- Our next myth is in the Bahamas, right?
- Yeah.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.999
Despite Tori's optimism, the temperature
of his... nether regions

29:18.000 --> 29:20.770
is certainly not the only problem.

29:21.390 --> 29:24.280
Looks like building our own
frozen lake was problematic.

29:24.470 --> 29:27.530
But compared to this, it was child's play.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.500
Here is what we are up against.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.000
Our blast shields, which
we left out overnight,

29:32.040 --> 29:34.820
are now buried under six feet of snow.

29:35.430 --> 29:38.100
Our paramedic can't get here
because the road is closed.

29:38.390 --> 29:41.800
And worst of all, the lake is
buried under three feet of snow.

29:42.130 --> 29:43.970
Which means, before we do any shooting,

29:43.980 --> 29:46.940
we've got to dig to get down to the ice.

29:47.490 --> 29:50.140
And as the weather goes
from bad to worse...

29:50.670 --> 29:53.180
I have already dug two feet
and I haven't seen ice yet.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.760
...that digging gets harder and harder.

29:56.620 --> 29:57.700
So I could keep digging it out,

29:57.701 --> 30:00.640
then mother nature just
keeps filling it back in.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.980
So Kari brings in reinforcements.

30:04.390 --> 30:06.320
Since we're digging at high altitude

30:06.321 --> 30:09.330
and fighting 40 mile an hour gusty winds,

30:09.750 --> 30:12.210
we've decided to bring in a few... helpers.

30:12.780 --> 30:16.410
Like the sheriff who lives up
here, and maybe a few others.

30:16.860 --> 30:20.410
With all hands on deck, the
team exposes enough ice

30:20.520 --> 30:22.740
before anyone gets exposure.

30:22.940 --> 30:25.070
So the good news is, if you can
call anything good news

30:25.280 --> 30:27.580
in these kinds of conditions,
we found the ice.

30:27.780 --> 30:29.030
So now we are ready to start testing.

30:29.230 --> 30:32.370
Now, remember, this myth is
about shooting a nine millimeter

30:32.560 --> 30:36.790
into a frozen lake bed and finding
the bullet spinning like a top.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.480
Seems kind of counter-intuitive to...

30:39.610 --> 30:41.380
fire into the ice that you're standing on,

30:41.570 --> 30:43.080
but, I mean, this isn't Logic Busters.

30:44.090 --> 30:46.390
We've gone to great efforts
to make this myth work,

30:46.570 --> 30:50.450
including getting high-tech hearing
devices, low-tech ear trumpets,

30:50.620 --> 30:54.150
but, as you can see by the horizontal
snow zooming past the camera,

30:54.410 --> 30:56.109
there is a huge amount of wind.

30:56.110 --> 30:58.530
And that is all we are gonna hear
in those hearing devices.

30:58.830 --> 31:01.320
So, we're going old fashioned.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.150
We're running.

31:02.350 --> 31:03.240
We're listening.

31:03.570 --> 31:07.560
But will that technique be good
enough to locate the mythical spin?

31:08.950 --> 31:12.110
All right. This is spinning ice
bullet in three, two, one...

31:13.110 --> 31:15.560
Next up, Adam unleashes the beast...

31:18.110 --> 31:21.220
...peppering Jamie with spy agent arms.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.210
I might have got hit. I'm not sure.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.520
At an abandoned military base,

31:30.600 --> 31:33.110
Adam and Jamie are about
to unleash the beast...

31:33.740 --> 31:36.690
- It is a perfect day for chasing.
- And shooting.

31:36.700 --> 31:38.119
Indeed.

31:38.120 --> 31:43.530
...as they test whether a spy car's
hood-mounted howitzer can ever be accurate.

31:43.770 --> 31:45.290
Oh, yeah. Great, baby.

31:45.530 --> 31:48.299
But first up, like all good spy scientists,

31:48.300 --> 31:49.870
they are starting with a control.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.780
As long as we are shooting between cars,

31:51.960 --> 31:53.880
we thought it would be a good
idea to start with a baseline.

31:54.070 --> 31:56.670
The most common way you see people
shoot between cars in the movie,

31:56.860 --> 32:00.349
in which during the car-chase,
the driver of the chasing car

32:00.350 --> 32:02.910
will start firing at the
person that he is chasing.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.530
In this case, I will be that driver

32:08.280 --> 32:11.310
and this will be my handy service revolver

32:11.910 --> 32:15.110
and Mr. Hyneman, well, he
will be my grizzled partner.

32:15.900 --> 32:20.580
And last but not least, police driver
Brian Fraiser will play the target.

32:20.990 --> 32:24.560
OK, this is shooting
the gun out the window.

32:24.740 --> 32:26.530
Brian, you may escape when ready.

32:29.790 --> 32:30.880
Oh, it's on.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.170
Okay.

32:35.390 --> 32:39.550
Adam will have one clip or 14
bullets to take down the target.

32:40.730 --> 32:43.200
It's hard to drive one-handed,
I'll tell you that.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.959
As Brian dodges and weaves, Jamie
keeps a tally of how many rounds

32:46.960 --> 32:48.330
Adam's let rip...

32:50.390 --> 32:52.310
...and how many have hit their target.

32:52.730 --> 32:55.910
Come on, 12.
You haven't even hit the car yet.

32:56.460 --> 32:59.930
It's fair to say that this is
a lot harder than it looks.

33:03.130 --> 33:06.490
Firing the hand-held gun out of the
car proved to be far from ideal.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.190
It was more difficult than you would think.

33:08.450 --> 33:10.410
Now, not to say that it couldn't be done,

33:10.610 --> 33:13.870
but we were not able to stop
the car or kill the driver.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.159
Which begs the question,
can the spy-inspired

33:17.160 --> 33:19.510
front-facing machine gun do any better?

33:20.940 --> 33:23.510
This test is with a machine
gun in a fixed position.

33:24.060 --> 33:25.500
What do I think is gonna happen?

33:25.501 --> 33:27.629
Well, I've actually been
saying this for years

33:27.630 --> 33:30.230
and it's the reason I always
wanted to do this test.

33:30.580 --> 33:33.080
I don't think I'm gonna be able to
be very effective in hitting Jamie.

33:33.290 --> 33:37.320
I've always thought that fixed machine guns
on the hood of a car was a stupid idea.

33:37.500 --> 33:42.300
Stupid, because as target Jamie explains,
they only fire straight ahead.

33:43.820 --> 33:46.629
Now, Adam's goal is to take
me out, and that means

33:46.630 --> 33:50.090
that he has to hit me in the head,
or he has to hit the tyre of the car.

33:50.570 --> 33:53.230
Now, given that he
has got no subtle control,

33:53.420 --> 33:55.770
it's only done by aiming the car,

33:56.680 --> 33:58.530
I think it's going to be almost impossible.

33:59.780 --> 34:01.200
All right, Mr. Hyneman,

34:01.820 --> 34:04.180
you may start whenever
you think you're ready.

34:04.580 --> 34:10.659
Okay, fixed gun in three, two, one...

34:11.449 --> 34:14.139
Like the last test,
this trial will also end

34:14.340 --> 34:15.949
when the gun runs out of ammo.

34:21.370 --> 34:22.630
Come to papa.

34:22.909 --> 34:24.449
But unlike the last test,

34:24.449 --> 34:28.510
this time, Adam has got
400 paint balls to fire.

34:28.710 --> 34:30.659
Here we go. Let's see what you got!

34:30.870 --> 34:33.550
At first, things pan out just as expected,

34:33.760 --> 34:35.850
as Adam fires miss after miss.

34:37.010 --> 34:40.429
Yet, slowly but surely, he
starts to get his eye in.

34:41.659 --> 34:43.489
I might have got hit. I'm not sure.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.770
And pretty soon, the occasional hit

34:46.960 --> 34:49.270
turns into a relentless barrage of bullets.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.360
There are bullets all over the
windshield right near me,

34:54.360 --> 34:57.560
so I'm feeling pretty shot at actually.

34:57.910 --> 34:59.990
No matter what moves Jamie makes,

35:00.240 --> 35:02.440
Adam nails him every time.

35:04.540 --> 35:05.640
Until he is out of ammo.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.700
What a horror show.

35:10.870 --> 35:13.390
I think I achieved my double "O"
status on this round.

35:13.580 --> 35:16.280
Agent Hyneman has successfully
been neutralized.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.010
Not only have I taken out the mud flap,

35:18.590 --> 35:20.359
not only have I taken out of the trunk,...

35:20.384 --> 35:21.884
I'm feeling the spray!

35:21.960 --> 35:23.649
...with extreme prejudice,

35:23.650 --> 35:26.010
I've also got a clean hit
to the back of his seat,

35:26.450 --> 35:27.720
a clean hit to his helmet...

35:27.960 --> 35:28.910
I might have got hit.

35:29.090 --> 35:29.960
I'm not sure.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.790
...and I've destroyed his windshield
and several of his side windows.

35:33.070 --> 35:34.790
Well, one hit the windshield.

35:34.990 --> 35:37.600
So, given that the gun
itself couldn't move,

35:37.810 --> 35:40.120
how did Adam end up doing so well?

35:40.300 --> 35:41.370
For the first third of the test,

35:41.371 --> 35:43.700
as I catch up with Jamie
and he is swerving,

35:43.890 --> 35:47.330
it always seems that my
bullets run over his car.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.840
And I have this epiphany,
if I smack on the brakes,

35:50.050 --> 35:51.180
the front of the car goes down,

35:51.370 --> 35:52.880
and I can actually aim that way.

35:53.070 --> 35:56.190
And it turns out I can aim plus or
minus like ten degrees that way,

35:56.380 --> 35:57.450
it's fantastic!

35:57.460 --> 36:00.230
I coupled that with
swerving back and forth.

36:00.420 --> 36:04.070
And somewhere around half way
through this test, I found my level

36:05.340 --> 36:09.620
and just started laying paint balls
into the driver's cabin of Jamie's car.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.120
It worked far better than I imagined

36:12.320 --> 36:14.860
it possibly could without
having physically tried it.

36:15.230 --> 36:18.030
Coming right up, will the
team finally spin out?

36:19.100 --> 36:20.090
It is spinning!

36:20.400 --> 36:21.980
And going in for the kill:

36:23.130 --> 36:26.280
a moveable feast for Adam's aim-able gun.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.420
Aw, the aiming is awesome!

36:34.510 --> 36:37.070
Here we are on the Caples frozen lake

36:37.360 --> 36:40.470
with winds up to 25 miles an
hour straight in your face.

36:40.690 --> 36:43.610
We got temperature lows
of about negative 30.

36:43.850 --> 36:46.670
And let me tell you, it does not
look like it's going to let up.

36:48.310 --> 36:51.930
All of which is making for some
seriously challenging testing.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.730
So given the terrible conditions,

36:55.030 --> 36:56.710
here is our plan.

36:56.770 --> 37:00.140
We positioned our gun at a 42 degree angle.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.250
We are triggering it with a string
pull, and we are going to rush in

37:04.650 --> 37:06.170
to see if we can find the bullet.

37:06.490 --> 37:10.220
And given the whiteout, I think we
are also going to montage the results.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.670
Sounds like a plan.

37:11.970 --> 37:15.630
All right, this is spinning
ice bullet in three, two, one...

37:16.800 --> 37:17.900
Run like the wind!

37:18.590 --> 37:21.860
But, unfortunately, it's
another montage of failure.

37:22.080 --> 37:25.160
Here's the bullet, but it's not spinning.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.530
Not at all.

37:26.760 --> 37:27.760
As hit...

37:29.360 --> 37:30.260
...after hit...

37:31.160 --> 37:33.080
I don't see any spinning bullet.

37:33.720 --> 37:34.960
...misses out on the spin.

37:36.030 --> 37:37.730
I can't feel my fingers.

37:37.970 --> 37:40.230
And I can't see any bullet.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.160
As the temperature dips
to 5 degrees Fahrenheit,

37:44.990 --> 37:47.610
morale is just as low.

37:47.635 --> 37:48.835
This myth sucks!

37:49.150 --> 37:51.350
But Tory wants to try one more thing.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.760
Now there is a couple of things
that we think are happening.

37:54.830 --> 37:57.079
One is, maybe the bullets
are hitting the ice

37:57.080 --> 37:58.320
and skipping off into the snow.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.160
Or maybe that the bullets
are hitting the ice

38:00.185 --> 38:02.285
and actually bouncing back into the snow.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.600
So what we are going to do
is change the target area

38:04.840 --> 38:06.630
closer to the center of our ice path,

38:06.860 --> 38:08.670
take a shot and see if
we can find the bullet

38:08.730 --> 38:11.270
and see exactly what is
happening to these things.

38:11.700 --> 38:17.360
With hypothermia a very real possibility,
it really is now or never.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.270
Will giving the bullet
room to ricochet backwards,

38:20.450 --> 38:23.290
rather than forwards, finally spin out?

38:23.490 --> 38:26.880
OK, this is spinning ice bullet
with room to bounce backwards,

38:27.380 --> 38:29.650
in three, two, one...

38:30.240 --> 38:31.130
Come on!

38:32.730 --> 38:34.460
It's spinning.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.880
It's spinning!

38:36.040 --> 38:37.190
Look at that!

38:37.450 --> 38:39.120
We got a spinning bullet!

38:40.550 --> 38:41.710
Holy crap! It worked!

38:42.340 --> 38:45.070
It's the shot that brought
this myth back from the cold.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.360
I can't believe it worked.

38:48.550 --> 38:50.840
I can't believe we got a spinning bullet.

38:51.770 --> 38:55.890
At last, after countless attempts,
they got the spin they were after.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.510
And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

38:58.990 --> 39:02.640
If we get one spinning bullet, that
was successful, let's do it again.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.920
In three, two, one...

39:07.350 --> 39:08.470
It's spinning!

39:09.870 --> 39:11.510
That's the second one in a row!

39:11.800 --> 39:13.530
And when it's three for three...

39:13.555 --> 39:14.755
It is spinning!

39:14.910 --> 39:15.950
That is continued success.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.540
We have got one after the other to spin!

39:19.160 --> 39:21.120
...you might say they are on a roll.

39:24.550 --> 39:25.880
It's spinning again!

39:26.090 --> 39:27.270
We've done this over and over.

39:27.470 --> 39:28.840
This myth is confirmed!

39:28.865 --> 39:30.009
Confirmed!

39:30.010 --> 39:32.110
I cannot believe how well this is working.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.520
We tried creating an iced

39:35.740 --> 39:38.360
lake bed that we could
shoot into back at home.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.680
But it really did take this sort

39:40.900 --> 39:43.590
of extreme weather for us
to get a spinning bullet.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.070
It was all worth it,

39:45.270 --> 39:48.670
the 70 mile an hour winds, the
10 degrees, the frozen toes, and...

39:49.840 --> 39:51.060
ah, the Grant-sickle.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.060
And with that, it's time to get warmed up.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.250
Where is that rescue party?

39:59.570 --> 40:01.260
We are the rescue party.

40:14.710 --> 40:16.860
At spy car mission control...

40:16.885 --> 40:18.085
Come to papa!

40:18.270 --> 40:22.710
...the forward facing firearm just took
out its target and then some.

40:22.780 --> 40:24.910
That worked beyond my wildest dreams.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
So, what's next?

40:26.640 --> 40:27.850
Now it's time to unlock what

40:28.050 --> 40:31.610
I thought was going to be the secret
potential power of this rig,

40:31.810 --> 40:34.059
which is, from inside the car,

40:34.060 --> 40:37.820
I can control an X-Y axis
wherever this gun fires,

40:38.030 --> 40:40.340
I can put paint balls
where I want to put them.

40:43.780 --> 40:45.410
Adam did pretty well with the fixed gun.

40:45.690 --> 40:49.220
And it makes sense that he should be able
to do even better with an aim-able gun.

40:49.830 --> 40:53.960
But the thing is, this adds a little bit
of multitasking that he has to do,

40:53.990 --> 40:57.600
so it might actually
have the opposite effect.

40:57.820 --> 41:03.920
Okay, aim-able gun in three, two, one...

41:04.470 --> 41:07.960
For the final time, the guys
put their pedals to the metal.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.300
Here we go!

41:13.240 --> 41:14.770
Do your best, buddy.

41:15.570 --> 41:16.560
Come on, Hyneman!

41:17.140 --> 41:18.340
You are mine!

41:18.760 --> 41:21.010
Rather than unleashing
bullets from the get go,

41:21.330 --> 41:23.550
on this one Adam bides his time...

41:23.551 --> 41:25.234
Oh, listen, Hyneman!

41:25.260 --> 41:28.210
...lining up the target,
thanks to his gun's camera,

41:28.420 --> 41:30.190
and the dashboard's monitor.

41:30.490 --> 41:31.960
I'm so on you!

41:32.400 --> 41:35.580
And only when Jamie
weaves into the cross-hairs...

41:35.605 --> 41:36.805
Weave all you want, man.

41:37.110 --> 41:38.420
I can follow you.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.670
...does Adam unleash hell.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.970
It is awesome!

41:44.070 --> 41:45.910
I totally got you.

41:45.935 --> 41:47.135
Look at that! I took out your wheel!

41:49.350 --> 41:50.940
With radar-like precision,

41:51.140 --> 41:53.640
the bullets are propelled
to do maximum damage.

41:53.665 --> 41:54.629
I'm hit!

41:54.630 --> 41:58.250
So much so, that this time,
Jamie gives up the ghost...

41:58.275 --> 41:59.475
Oh, yeah!

41:59.530 --> 42:02.900
...with Adam having
fired off just 60 rounds.

42:05.990 --> 42:09.310
So, was making my hood-mounted
machine gun aim-able more effective?

42:09.530 --> 42:13.340
I think the entire story is told
from right where I'm standing.

42:13.580 --> 42:15.960
If you look at this car after this test

42:16.160 --> 42:18.189
and compare it to what this car looked like

42:18.190 --> 42:19.310
after my fixed machine gun test

42:19.480 --> 42:23.489
when it was riddled with paint, you
can just see that this is a far more

42:23.490 --> 42:25.920
surgical and effective way
to take somebody out.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.640
Ain't that the truth?

42:28.870 --> 42:33.580
Using fewer bullets to chalk up
more kill shots, the aim-able gun

42:33.770 --> 42:36.200
is the winner of this cold war.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.940
Well, I think from all this testing, we
can conclude that a machine gun

42:40.140 --> 42:42.020
on the hood of your car equals good.

42:42.210 --> 42:45.509
As a secret agent weapon, even
the stationary machine gun was

42:45.510 --> 42:46.970
far more effective than
I thought it would be.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.510
Yeah, but their effectiveness
seems to be largely due to

42:49.511 --> 42:52.590
the sheer volume of bullets
they are able to spew out.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.170
I mean, sooner or later, they
are going to hit something.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.890
Okay, but isn't that always the
point of a machine gun?

42:57.915 --> 43:00.515
Indeed it is, <i>mon frere</i>!
