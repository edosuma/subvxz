WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.404
Uhh!

00:09.244 --> 00:11.745
Attention! Officer on deck!

00:12.831 --> 00:15.688
And this is our core observation facility.

00:15.689 --> 00:18.358
Now, the system runs too
hot to watch in person,

00:18.359 --> 00:20.810
but if you turn your
attention to the monitors,

00:20.811 --> 00:22.479
we can give you quite a show.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.481
Mr. Hoskins, power it up, please.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.316
Yes, doctor.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.067
Now, the new material
allows for computing capacity

00:28.068 --> 00:31.955
tens and tens of thousands times
faster than what we have now.

00:31.956 --> 00:34.040
So, are we talking artificial intelligence?

00:34.041 --> 00:36.576
No. That's a software problem.

00:36.577 --> 00:38.628
This is raw computing power.

00:38.629 --> 00:41.498
More appropriate for battle analysis,

00:41.499 --> 00:42.715
it'll run millions of simulations

00:42.716 --> 00:44.000
of what could happen,

00:44.001 --> 00:46.085
predict the future with 99% accuracy

00:46.086 --> 00:47.554
within a single second,

00:47.555 --> 00:50.423
or this test will map a 3-D space

00:50.424 --> 00:53.810
and use it to model quantum teleportation.

00:53.811 --> 00:56.095
What is it? What's happening?

00:56.096 --> 00:57.847
It's an overload in the quantum field!

00:57.848 --> 01:00.733
- Well, shut it down now!
- It's not responding.

01:00.734 --> 01:03.069
- Coolant is boiling off!
- Sound the alarms! Evacuate the facility!

01:03.070 --> 01:06.689
Let's go! Move it!

01:06.690 --> 01:15.558
<i>Season 2, Episode 8:
And the Point of Salvation</i>

01:19.753 --> 01:22.956
Thrice I call thee,

01:22.957 --> 01:25.875
spirit of the hill.

01:25.876 --> 01:28.461
Thrice I summon thee,

01:28.462 --> 01:31.780
thy fortune and thy luck.

01:34.051 --> 01:37.020
Thrice I bind thee, subject to my will.

01:37.021 --> 01:40.440
Thrice I name thee, free spirit... Puck.

01:40.441 --> 01:42.442
What is this?

01:42.443 --> 01:44.444
You lure me with sweets and then bind me?

01:44.445 --> 01:46.813
Do you not know my power?

01:46.814 --> 01:49.732
I will kill thy calve and blight thy field.

01:49.733 --> 01:52.535
Your daughter's eyes will
cross. Your son's legs will bow.

01:52.536 --> 01:54.070
Yes, yes, yes, yes, and you know what?

01:54.071 --> 01:55.572
That would be... whew!

01:55.573 --> 01:58.658
So menacing if we were in medieval Ireland,

01:58.659 --> 02:01.494
and I was a simple-minded sod farmer.

02:01.495 --> 02:05.798
But we're not, and I'm not, so it's not.

02:05.799 --> 02:07.083
Galeas?

02:07.084 --> 02:09.752
Grail knight of virtue?

02:09.752 --> 02:12.722
I'll give thee one favor for
free for such a worthy one.

02:12.723 --> 02:15.892
Three answers truly given...

02:15.893 --> 02:18.478
nothing more, nothing less...

02:18.479 --> 02:19.812
then you are released.

02:19.813 --> 02:21.648
If I were not desperate for information,

02:21.649 --> 02:23.182
I wouldn't risk dealing with a fey.

02:23.183 --> 02:26.736
Are you sure? I know many things.

02:26.737 --> 02:29.606
I know what ends your immortality.

02:29.607 --> 02:33.860
You cannot be killed,
but you can die, Galeas.

02:33.861 --> 02:36.195
Is this not worth a bargain?

02:36.196 --> 02:37.879
Hmm.

02:41.835 --> 02:43.620
No.

02:43.621 --> 02:47.540
Three answers freely given,
then you are released.

02:47.541 --> 02:52.595
Prospero, who binds Ariel, he
has the staff of Zarathustra.

02:52.596 --> 02:54.797
Can he use it?

02:54.798 --> 02:58.017
Hmm. His first staff was
from the Tree of Knowledge.

02:58.018 --> 03:01.137
The second is powerful,
but is not his first.

03:01.138 --> 03:02.605
He struggles.

03:02.606 --> 03:04.474
Struggles? Struggles with what?

03:04.475 --> 03:06.809
What is his intent?

03:06.810 --> 03:09.812
To discover that, I must roam.

03:09.813 --> 03:12.231
Roam. You still owe me two answers.

03:12.232 --> 03:15.151
I will return, Knight, with the answers,

03:15.152 --> 03:17.654
whether you like them or not.

03:21.374 --> 03:23.960
I hate fairies.

03:23.961 --> 03:25.211
Quantum computing.

03:25.212 --> 03:26.713
I mean, that is, like,

03:26.714 --> 03:28.665
the holy grail of computer technology.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.967
Never thought I'd live
long enough to see it work.

03:30.968 --> 03:32.752
Yeah, I'm more interested in the rock.

03:32.753 --> 03:34.671
I mean, I'm pretty good with precious gems,

03:34.672 --> 03:36.639
but I don't recognize this one.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.676
Says it's a newly discovered,
natural form of graphene.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.010
That can't be right.

03:41.011 --> 03:42.845
In order to overcome quantum decoherence,

03:42.846 --> 03:44.931
it would have to be a
super-conducting graphene

03:44.932 --> 03:46.766
that had the properties of both a solid

03:46.767 --> 03:49.185
and a Bose-Einstein condensate.

03:49.186 --> 03:51.104
A what?

03:51.105 --> 03:53.690
Nothing. No. I was just...
theorizing what it would take

03:53.691 --> 03:55.775
for a chunk of graphene
to solve quantum computing.

03:55.776 --> 03:57.276
Well, you just described

03:57.277 --> 04:01.114
the precise physical qualities
of Atlantean Thaumatite.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.701
So, DARPA... a top-secret,
high-tech research lab...

04:04.702 --> 04:07.704
is messing around with something Atlantean?

04:07.705 --> 04:08.955
I don't follow.

04:08.956 --> 04:10.340
It's Atlantean.

04:10.341 --> 04:12.925
Like Atlantis.

04:12.926 --> 04:15.795
Like Plato's "Timaeus" and "Critias."

04:15.796 --> 04:17.547
A large island that sank off
the... who... who... what...

04:17.548 --> 04:19.966
would somebody remind me
why this guy's even here?

04:19.966 --> 04:21.684
Th-this... this use of this material

04:21.685 --> 04:24.637
is what destroyed Atlantis.

04:24.638 --> 04:26.022
You know, DARPA does

04:26.023 --> 04:27.890
terrifying enough things
with science alone...

04:27.891 --> 04:29.976
stealth bombers, military drones,

04:29.977 --> 04:31.694
Internet comments sections.

04:31.695 --> 04:33.696
Okay, we need to recover this crystal.

04:33.697 --> 04:35.898
But quantum computing
could change the world.

04:35.899 --> 04:37.734
The way Atlantis was changed?

04:37.735 --> 04:39.035
This magic is too dangerous

04:39.036 --> 04:40.370
to be left in the hands of the military.

04:40.371 --> 04:41.871
All right, people, listen up.

04:41.872 --> 04:43.656
This is not your
run-of-the-mill mission.

04:43.657 --> 04:45.908
DARPA runs under strict military protocol.

04:45.909 --> 04:48.244
We go in, we get the
Thaumatite, we get out.

04:48.245 --> 04:49.996
No poking around, no wandering off,

04:49.997 --> 04:52.832
no opening things, no souvenirs.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.250
You know,

04:54.251 --> 04:55.918
sometimes I don't think
you guys take me seriously.

04:55.919 --> 04:59.138
Really? There's times you think we do?

04:59.139 --> 05:01.891
Make sure we pull
everything from the server

05:01.892 --> 05:03.142
and perform a full crash wipe...

05:03.143 --> 05:05.595
every drive, every disk, everything.

05:08.148 --> 05:11.267
So, this is strict military protocol.

05:11.268 --> 05:13.236
It's critical now! Leave everything!

05:13.237 --> 05:16.272
Evacuate out the front gate.
Deadlock all the other Doors!

05:16.273 --> 05:17.940
I'm initiating Faded Giant protocol.

05:17.941 --> 05:19.659
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

05:19.660 --> 05:21.778
- Back through the Door now.
- What about the Thaumatite?

05:21.779 --> 05:23.279
"Faded Giant" is military code
for "this place is gonna blow."

05:23.280 --> 05:24.781
Go! Go!

05:30.120 --> 05:32.872
This isn't the Annex.
We're still at the base.

05:32.873 --> 05:34.123
Why are we still here?

05:34.124 --> 05:35.792
Why's this place trashed?

05:35.793 --> 05:37.726
Fall back. Through the Door again.

05:40.681 --> 05:42.215
The Annex is gone.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.933
It's disconnected.

05:43.934 --> 05:45.692
Whatever happened here
disrupted the Back Door.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.176
It's interfering with the phones, too.

05:47.177 --> 05:48.068
I can't reach Jenkins.

05:48.069 --> 05:50.440
We're gonna have to get out on our own.

05:50.441 --> 05:54.193
"Best way out is always
through." Robert Frost.

05:54.194 --> 05:55.812
Then let's get the hell through.

06:02.786 --> 06:04.153
Sir?

06:04.154 --> 06:05.371
We're here to help you.

06:05.372 --> 06:06.823
I'm Colonel Eve Baird.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.158
Can you tell us what's...

06:11.000 --> 06:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:19.720 --> 06:21.337
No.

06:25.392 --> 06:27.393
I'm guessing that's not DARPA trying out

06:27.394 --> 06:29.262
some new kind of watchdog.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.848
No. That was a rabid, feral, rage person.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.316
Could be a radioactive reaction

06:33.317 --> 06:34.817
to the overload.

06:34.818 --> 06:36.402
A computer overload caused this?

06:36.403 --> 06:38.237
A magical quantum computer.

06:38.238 --> 06:40.356
They were running the system,
encountered some corrupted code,

06:40.357 --> 06:41.858
and it fritzed.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.863
Quantum mechanics do play a crucial role

06:46.864 --> 06:48.247
in human consciousness.

06:48.248 --> 06:50.032
An overload in the quantum field

06:50.033 --> 06:53.920
could have created a superposition state

06:53.921 --> 06:56.255
that disrupts higher brain function,

06:56.256 --> 06:59.509
effectively turning people into...

06:59.510 --> 07:02.011
- Rage people.
- Not calling them "rage people."

07:02.012 --> 07:04.180
Okay, assume it is a
quantum overload thing...

07:04.181 --> 07:05.431
how do we end it?

07:05.432 --> 07:06.966
We shut down the main computer,

07:06.967 --> 07:08.885
pull the Atlantean stone from the core.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.436
That will collapse the superposition.

07:10.437 --> 07:11.971
That should end the effect.

07:11.972 --> 07:13.890
Oh, finding the computer's
gonna be a treat.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.474
- This place is a maze.
- You got schematics?

07:15.475 --> 07:17.226
Yeah.

07:18.478 --> 07:19.896
We're looking for a coolant system.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.447
Those moving lines...

07:21.448 --> 07:22.899
it looks like a road map to
what's hot in the building.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.317
So, if this place overheated...

07:24.318 --> 07:26.202
What... what's that thing in the middle?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.822
Heavily shielded, fortified room.

07:29.823 --> 07:32.041
That's where we find
the techno-magic mojo.

07:32.042 --> 07:34.592
- Let's go.
- Okay.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.805
Would you watch it with that thing?

07:45.806 --> 07:48.106
I think I know how to handle this.

07:50.143 --> 07:51.978
Know how to spot a taser tile?

07:51.979 --> 07:54.347
Electrified floor
plate... security measure.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.082
We're gonna want to step over that.

07:58.268 --> 08:00.035
You're welcome.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.527
Whatever's causing all
this is behind that door.

08:08.528 --> 08:10.413
- Can you get it open?
- Oh, it's a basic Glenn-Rieder XCD.

08:10.414 --> 08:12.248
I could open these in my...

08:12.249 --> 08:13.916
Invalid entry code activated.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.334
That shouldn't have happened.

08:15.335 --> 08:17.453
- Some master thief.
- That shouldn't have happened.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.291
Fall back! Fall back!

08:25.345 --> 08:27.597
That shouldn't have
happened. I know those locks.

08:27.598 --> 08:29.348
Doesn't matter now.

08:29.349 --> 08:30.850
- No one's blaming you, Ezekiel.
- Well, I kinda am!

08:30.851 --> 08:33.385
Here they come!

08:33.386 --> 08:35.520
- Ohh!
- Stone!

08:35.522 --> 08:37.974
Ezekiel, run for the...

08:44.982 --> 08:47.199
This isn't the Annex.
We're still in the base.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.484
Why are we still here?

08:48.485 --> 08:50.152
Why's this place trashed?

08:50.153 --> 08:52.321
Fall back. Through the door again.

08:52.322 --> 08:54.240
You're alive.

08:54.241 --> 08:55.574
We're alive.

08:55.575 --> 08:58.544
- The Annex is gone.
- It's disconnected.

08:58.545 --> 09:02.048
Whatever happened here
disrupted the Back Door as well.

09:02.049 --> 09:04.467
It's interfering with the phones, too.

09:04.468 --> 09:07.219
It's a time loop. We're
trapped in a time loop.

09:10.726 --> 09:13.433
It's a time loop. We're
trapped in a time loop.

09:13.434 --> 09:14.933
We're repeating the day over,

09:14.934 --> 09:16.768
just like in that movie "Groundhog Day"...

09:16.769 --> 09:20.489
or "Star Trek" or "X-Files" or "Buffy,"

09:20.490 --> 09:23.108
which means I didn't get you all killed.

09:23.109 --> 09:25.243
You didn't what?

09:25.244 --> 09:26.578
Didn't n-nothing. Whatever.

09:26.579 --> 09:28.246
If we are in a time loop,

09:28.247 --> 09:30.365
how many fingers am I holding up?

09:30.366 --> 09:31.833
No idea.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.118
This is only our second time through.

09:33.119 --> 09:35.337
Stupid time loop. You're crazy.

09:35.338 --> 09:38.840
Crazy? So, on the scale
of "Running from Minotaurs"

09:38.841 --> 09:41.510
to "Santa Claus is now
a best mate of ours,"

09:41.511 --> 09:43.545
where would time loop fall?

09:43.546 --> 09:46.465
A computer overload caused this?

09:46.466 --> 09:49.200
A magical quantum computer.

09:53.806 --> 09:56.808
An overload in the quantum
field could have created

09:56.809 --> 10:02.147
a superposition state that
disrupts local space-time...

10:02.148 --> 10:05.450
Effectively creating a time loop.

10:05.451 --> 10:06.952
No. If we're all stuck here,

10:06.953 --> 10:08.870
why are you the only one that remembers it?

10:08.871 --> 10:10.539
I was first one through the Door.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.491
Maybe... something-something magic?

10:12.492 --> 10:14.076
We'll figure it out later.

10:14.077 --> 10:16.828
Assume we are in a time
loop. How do we end it?

10:16.829 --> 10:19.498
Shut down the quantum computer. Right?

10:19.499 --> 10:22.417
Yes...

10:22.418 --> 10:24.503
Collapse the superposition.

10:24.504 --> 10:26.471
It should end the effect.

10:26.472 --> 10:29.841
And what about the rage people?

10:29.842 --> 10:31.343
The what nows?

10:31.344 --> 10:33.178
There! Right over there,

10:33.179 --> 10:36.231
there was this angry rage-person thing.

10:36.232 --> 10:38.350
Oh, uh, your gun won't work,
so, uh, use the crowbar.

10:38.351 --> 10:40.435
- What crowbar?
- Stone's crowbar.

10:40.436 --> 10:41.937
I-I don't have a crowbar.

10:41.938 --> 10:43.605
I didn't... I didn't grab the crowbar.

10:43.606 --> 10:45.607
You started talking about all
this time-loop stuff, and I...

10:45.608 --> 10:47.325
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:51.447 --> 10:53.665
Okay. That was my bad.

10:53.666 --> 10:55.867
This isn't the Annex.
We're still in the base.

10:55.868 --> 10:57.169
Why are we still here?

10:57.170 --> 10:58.920
Time loop. We're trapped in a time loop.

10:58.921 --> 11:00.622
What are you talking about?

11:00.623 --> 11:02.124
The Annex is gone. The phones are dead.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.341
Let's not do this whole thing again.

11:03.342 --> 11:04.626
Time loop.

11:04.627 --> 11:07.295
If we're in a time loop, how many fing...

11:07.296 --> 11:09.047
You didn't actually show me last time.

11:09.048 --> 11:11.183
Look, just follow me. You
need to see the rage person.

11:11.184 --> 11:12.467
The what now?

11:12.468 --> 11:14.568
Oh, and, uh, stone, grab the crowbar.

11:17.356 --> 11:19.691
Uhh!

11:19.692 --> 11:21.693
I'm guessing this wasn't DARPA cooking up

11:21.694 --> 11:23.361
some new kind of watchdog, huh?

11:23.362 --> 11:24.696
Cassandra, how are these...

11:24.697 --> 11:26.615
not calling them "rage people"...

11:26.616 --> 11:29.117
connected to Ezekiel's time loop?

11:29.118 --> 11:31.286
They're not.

11:31.287 --> 11:32.988
An overload in the quantum field

11:32.989 --> 11:34.956
could have created a superposition state

11:34.957 --> 11:36.575
that disrupts higher brain function

11:36.576 --> 11:39.494
or... one that disrupts local space-time,

11:39.495 --> 11:42.464
but I don't see how they
could have affected both.

11:42.465 --> 11:45.000
Wait.

11:45.001 --> 11:47.586
We've been through this loop
a couple times now, right?

11:47.587 --> 11:49.387
Yes.

11:49.388 --> 11:51.056
And you're the only one who
ever remembers any of this?

11:51.057 --> 11:52.823
Yes.

11:55.595 --> 11:57.095
What? What is that?

11:57.096 --> 11:59.431
Nothing. Nothing.

11:59.432 --> 12:01.149
It's just, a temporal loop implies

12:01.150 --> 12:03.185
a complicated interplay
of cause and effect,

12:03.186 --> 12:05.187
and you're more of a...

12:05.188 --> 12:06.938
wing-it kinda guy.

12:06.939 --> 12:10.358
I'm just touched by your trust, really.

12:10.359 --> 12:13.111
Now, Cassandra said if we
shut the quantum computer down,

12:13.112 --> 12:14.362
this all ends.

12:14.363 --> 12:17.499
I did? Ooh. That was clever of me.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.334
The quantum computer is behind this door,

12:19.335 --> 12:21.036
which I definitely did
not get everybody killed

12:21.037 --> 12:23.121
by failing to open.

12:23.122 --> 12:26.424
Warning. Access panel open.

12:26.425 --> 12:29.094
Okay, this is not a
basic Glenn-Rieder XCD.

12:29.095 --> 12:31.213
- How do you beat it?
- I have no idea.

12:31.214 --> 12:33.131
It would take hours to trace the circuit.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.468
Hey, you're sure the time loop stays open

12:36.469 --> 12:38.687
until we pull that Atlantean doodad

12:38.688 --> 12:40.105
- out of the computer, right?
- Yes. Why?

12:40.106 --> 12:41.640
Jones?

12:41.641 --> 12:44.309
So... nothing we do has
any real consequences

12:44.310 --> 12:46.444
until we're out of the time loop.

12:46.445 --> 12:49.231
Theoretically, no. We can
go through as many times...

12:49.232 --> 12:51.616
Jones.

12:51.617 --> 12:53.318
There's only four wires.

12:53.319 --> 12:55.654
I can do this by multiple choice.

12:55.655 --> 12:58.707
Invalid entry code. Access denied.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.742
Some master thief.

13:00.743 --> 13:03.378
Invalid entry code. Access denied.

13:03.379 --> 13:05.413
Some master thief.

13:05.414 --> 13:07.165
Invalid entry code. Access denied.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.217
Some master thief.

13:09.218 --> 13:10.552
Invalid entry code. Access denied.

13:10.553 --> 13:12.053
Aah! This is impossible!

13:12.054 --> 13:13.338
Ezekiel Jones does not lose to a lock.

13:13.339 --> 13:15.823
Some master thief!

13:21.347 --> 13:23.064
I said watch it with that thing.

13:23.065 --> 13:25.267
I think I know how to handle this.

13:25.268 --> 13:27.352
Hey. You know what?

13:27.353 --> 13:29.787
You're right. After you.

13:39.115 --> 13:41.703
Have we ever just stared
at it this long before?

13:41.704 --> 13:42.534
No!

13:46.088 --> 13:47.372
You know, there... there is something weird

13:47.373 --> 13:50.542
about those lights. I just...

13:50.543 --> 13:53.261
That red is just a half-shade off

13:53.262 --> 13:54.679
the standard LED red.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.715
And that yellow-green...
I mean, why that color?

13:56.716 --> 13:59.384
Unless it's a key.

13:59.385 --> 14:02.103
It's a light.

14:02.104 --> 14:05.473
Light that color has a
wavelength of 570 nanometers,

14:05.474 --> 14:08.143
frequency 523 Terahertz.

14:08.144 --> 14:09.394
523...

14:09.395 --> 14:12.113
523 Terahertz.

14:12.114 --> 14:14.366
That's the same sound
wave frequency as high "C."

14:14.367 --> 14:15.617
That can't be a coincidence.

14:15.618 --> 14:17.402
Nobody builds locks like that.

14:17.403 --> 14:21.456
A-and that shade of red, 444 Terahertz.

14:21.457 --> 14:24.876
That's high "A."

14:33.753 --> 14:37.255
So, if I just rewire this panel
using an alternating pattern

14:37.256 --> 14:40.642
of electrical pulses along
each of those four frequencies,

14:40.643 --> 14:43.595
it's just like rewiring a speaker.

14:43.596 --> 14:47.531
Computer code entry. Access granted.

14:50.236 --> 14:51.770
Hmm.

14:51.771 --> 14:54.272
Some master thief.

14:54.273 --> 14:56.441
That... that... that's not how locks work!

15:00.246 --> 15:02.280
That's leaking a lot of coolant.

15:02.281 --> 15:03.748
Atlantean Thaumatite.

15:03.749 --> 15:05.917
We remove it, and the quantum decoherence

15:05.918 --> 15:08.586
collapses the field and
the time loop should end.

15:10.539 --> 15:12.841
Warning. System failure.

15:12.842 --> 15:14.759
- That doesn't sound ended.
- Warning. System failure.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.128
- You said it would stop them.
- It should have stopped everything.

15:17.129 --> 15:18.630
We're cut off. There's no way out.

15:18.631 --> 15:20.398
- What?
- I got a door here, but I can't get to it.

15:20.399 --> 15:22.801
Here they come! Go!

15:31.107 --> 15:33.130
This isn't the Annex.
We're still in the base.

15:33.131 --> 15:34.965
Why are we still here?

15:34.966 --> 15:36.466
Why is this place trashed?

15:36.467 --> 15:37.968
No!

15:37.969 --> 15:39.853
No! No! No! This was supposed to end!

15:39.854 --> 15:42.389
What are you talking about?

15:42.390 --> 15:44.474
The time loop. We're
trapped in a time loop,

15:44.475 --> 15:46.309
and I'm the only one that knows it.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.478
We shut the thing down,
but nothing's changed.

15:48.479 --> 15:50.864
Ah! How many fingers do
I have behind my back?

15:50.865 --> 15:52.782
You know what? I'm not gonna tell you.

15:52.783 --> 15:54.067
Annoying, isn't it?

15:54.068 --> 15:56.286
A computer overload caused this?

15:56.287 --> 15:57.954
A magical quantum compu...

15:57.955 --> 15:59.239
Computer. Yes.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.074
And you said pulling out the crystal thingy

16:01.075 --> 16:03.960
was gonna shut the thing down
and stop the rage people...

16:03.961 --> 16:05.245
The what now?

16:05.246 --> 16:07.080
...and end the time loop, but it didn't.

16:07.081 --> 16:08.331
We're still stuck.

16:08.332 --> 16:09.883
You sure you pulled it out right?

16:09.884 --> 16:11.218
Yes! Yes, I did!

16:11.219 --> 16:14.004
Okay, everybody calm down.

16:14.005 --> 16:16.306
Let's assume it is a... time loop.

16:16.307 --> 16:18.558
We start here. Every time.

16:18.559 --> 16:20.927
Where does it end? Same place every time?

16:20.928 --> 16:23.346
No, no, it resets when one of us dies.

16:23.347 --> 16:24.764
Mostly you.

16:24.765 --> 16:26.233
Wait. But if we're all stuck here,

16:26.234 --> 16:27.817
how come you're the only
one that remembers it?

16:27.818 --> 16:29.152
I don't know!

16:29.153 --> 16:30.520
Wait, it's possible that
we're stuck in some sort

16:30.521 --> 16:32.405
of quantum entanglement with the computer.

16:32.406 --> 16:34.274
That's why it resets each time we die...

16:34.275 --> 16:36.910
Which means you may be
able to break the loop

16:36.911 --> 16:39.496
by getting all of us
outside of the quantum field.

16:39.497 --> 16:41.281
All right.

16:41.282 --> 16:44.284
First we find the Thaumatite,
then we find a way out.

16:44.285 --> 16:46.002
Fine!

16:48.289 --> 16:50.423
All right, we're here. Nearest exit?

16:50.424 --> 16:51.958
Remember the scientist?

16:51.959 --> 16:53.960
Everything's deadlocked but the main gate.

16:53.961 --> 16:55.962
If we could just get to this
emergency exit... that won't work.

16:55.963 --> 16:57.380
There's a coolant leak blocking it off

16:57.381 --> 16:59.466
in the main computer core.

16:59.467 --> 17:01.851
What kind of leak?

17:01.852 --> 17:03.186
- Warning. System failure.
- They're coming!

17:03.187 --> 17:04.854
Come on!

17:04.855 --> 17:06.439
There's three different
bypasses and one shot joint!

17:06.440 --> 17:08.023
I gotta reroute lines!

17:08.025 --> 17:10.894
And I need both hands
to hold this pressure!

17:10.895 --> 17:13.063
This pipe is 200 degrees!

17:13.064 --> 17:15.815
It isn't real. There are no consequences.

17:15.816 --> 17:20.203
This isn't real. There are no consequences.

17:21.571 --> 17:24.241
- Aah!
- Jones! Jones! Jones!

17:24.242 --> 17:25.458
Do it!

17:27.328 --> 17:30.580
Uhh!

17:30.581 --> 17:35.051
That was actually... brave.

17:35.052 --> 17:36.636
If I'd known how much it would have hurt,

17:36.637 --> 17:38.171
I probably wouldn't have done it.

17:38.172 --> 17:41.258
That's it. That has to be the way out.

17:41.259 --> 17:44.177
"Best way out is always
through." Robert Frost.

17:44.178 --> 17:47.079
Well, then let's get the hell through.

17:48.232 --> 17:50.934
Go! Run!

18:08.169 --> 18:11.087
And this pipe is 200 degrees!

18:12.373 --> 18:14.124
- Aah!
- No, Jones! Jones!

18:14.125 --> 18:15.375
Do it!

18:20.214 --> 18:21.514
It's just a gate.

18:21.515 --> 18:23.383
Ezekiel Jones does not lose to a gate.

18:23.384 --> 18:25.200
There has to be some kind of trigger.

18:38.983 --> 18:41.985
Time loop.

18:41.986 --> 18:43.486
How many times?

18:43.487 --> 18:47.407
I don't know. 60, give or take.

18:47.408 --> 18:49.292
What if we tried...

18:49.293 --> 18:51.578
Every time?

18:51.579 --> 18:53.178
Every time.

19:09.980 --> 19:12.482
This isn't the Annex.
We're still in the base.

19:12.483 --> 19:15.235
Why are we still here?
Why's this place trashed?

19:15.236 --> 19:17.354
It's a time loop.

19:17.355 --> 19:19.606
We're trapped in a time loop,

19:19.607 --> 19:21.991
and there's no way out.

19:21.992 --> 19:24.527
What are you talking about?

19:26.747 --> 19:28.365
You okay?

19:28.366 --> 19:31.618
No, not especially.

19:31.619 --> 19:33.670
Okay.

19:33.671 --> 19:35.121
Just... take a minute.

19:35.122 --> 19:37.189
We'll scout around without you.

19:39.677 --> 19:42.345
Don't.

19:42.346 --> 19:44.347
Don't go.

19:44.348 --> 19:46.716
Please.

19:46.717 --> 19:49.485
I can't watch you die anymore.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.201
Aah!

20:18.499 --> 20:20.500
It's not a time loop.

20:20.501 --> 20:22.434
It's a video game.

20:27.766 --> 20:30.061
It's not a time loop. It's a video game.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.479
This is a Save Point!

20:31.480 --> 20:33.448
What are you talking about?

20:33.449 --> 20:34.649
It explains everything.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.651
Why are there ragers? They're the enemies.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.203
That crazy lock... it's
a hacking mini-game.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.322
Why does this guy always
wait until we come near?

20:41.323 --> 20:42.657
That's his trigger point.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.076
This whole building is a video game level.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.211
Ezekiel, you are not making any sense.

20:47.212 --> 20:50.665
No, no. I can prove it. Here. Watch.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.471
A first aid kit in a crate?

20:56.472 --> 20:58.756
It's a health pack. This is a loot drop.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.425
This is crazy.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.143
For crying out... here.

21:02.144 --> 21:03.394
Don't!

21:03.395 --> 21:05.346
- Aah!
- Jones!

21:05.347 --> 21:07.098
What the... What?!

21:17.359 --> 21:18.776
We're in a video game?!

21:18.777 --> 21:20.361
You wanna see the rage people?

21:20.362 --> 21:22.613
Yeah, man!

21:22.614 --> 21:24.582
The what now?

21:24.583 --> 21:26.117
Uhh!

21:27.453 --> 21:28.703
Rage people.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.039
It's a survival horror game.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.291
Is it... is it more of a
sandbox or is it a railroad?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.709
Okay, I'm not buying

21:34.710 --> 21:38.046
a computer overload
traps us in a video game.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.464
A magical quantum computer.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.132
They were running the system,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.801
encountered some corrupted
code, and then it fritzed.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.720
What code? I mean,
every lab geek everywhere

21:45.721 --> 21:49.140
with access to a computer has
put some kind of game onto it.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.560
Okay.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.645
So, if the core database downloaded

21:54.646 --> 21:56.698
the corrupted code from that game,

21:56.699 --> 21:58.866
then an overload in the quantum field

21:58.867 --> 22:01.319
could have created a superposition state

22:01.320 --> 22:04.238
that amplified virtual
reality into actual reality.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.457
So, we're not inside the video game.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.743
The video game is overwriting reality.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.162
We went through the door at
the moment of the overload,

22:11.163 --> 22:12.463
so we weren't affected.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.132
Yeah, we all went through the door.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.134
Why are you the only one that remembers it?

22:16.135 --> 22:18.386
Now it finally makes sense!

22:18.387 --> 22:20.755
I-I was the first in.
That made me the player.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.558
The DARPA personnel...
they became the ragers.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.843
And you lot... It's an escort mission.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.429
That why it resets every
time one of you dies.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.647
It's an escort mission?

22:29.648 --> 22:31.149
I'm not jealous of you at all now.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.401
Um, what's an escort mission?

22:33.402 --> 22:35.653
Ugh. Only the most annoying gameplay ever,

22:35.654 --> 22:38.606
where you take a bunch of
computer-controlled characters

22:38.607 --> 22:40.525
too dumb to take care of themselves

22:40.526 --> 22:41.859
from point "A" to point "B."

22:41.860 --> 22:44.779
That's you guys.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.831
Okay. Assume it is a video game.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.282
How do we get out?

22:48.283 --> 22:50.785
Easy... we find the next Save Point.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.788
That gate's a distraction...
classic video game trope.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.340
You tell the player where to go,
and right before they get there,

22:56.341 --> 22:58.342
you block them off with a
rock fall or an explosion.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.627
Yeah, or...

23:01.130 --> 23:02.680
A closing gate. It's a triggered event.

23:02.681 --> 23:04.799
There's nothing you can
do about it. I hate those.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.467
However, if the player's blocked,

23:06.468 --> 23:08.219
you gotta give them another way out.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.638
So, e-even though there's
only one exit on the map...

23:10.639 --> 23:12.523
Somewhere there's another way out.

23:12.524 --> 23:14.308
Now we know what we're looking for.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.695
There's a weapons cache
this way. We should load up.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.280
Shotgun on the rocket launcher!

23:19.281 --> 23:20.481
Does that mean you want the shotgun

23:20.482 --> 23:21.783
or the rocket launcher?

23:21.784 --> 23:23.367
Hang on.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.536
This isn't a weapons...

23:25.537 --> 23:27.155
- Jones!
- What?!

23:27.156 --> 23:28.656
What are you doing, man?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.491
I don't know what's on
the other side of the gate.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.210
It'll be a whole new set of challenges.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.494
Jones, let us out of here.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.463
Every person in the group adds more risk

23:35.464 --> 23:38.166
that someone will make a
mistake, get ambushed, or die.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.667
One person...

23:39.668 --> 23:42.170
better chance of learning
every trap, every trick.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.505
Once I can get myself through,
I can get you guys through.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.591
I won't be long.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.643
Well, not long from your point of view.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.344
Listen, if what you said is true,

23:50.345 --> 23:51.596
we all gotta work together.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.830
I can't watch you die anymore!

23:55.517 --> 23:59.737
This way, you sit there, nice and safe,

23:59.738 --> 24:02.440
while I go learn what's past the gate,

24:02.441 --> 24:05.359
while I figure out how to beat it.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.862
That way, only I die.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.581
You guys won't even remember.

24:10.582 --> 24:11.999
We'll reset,

24:12.000 --> 24:15.870
and you guys won't remember a thing.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.371
It's for the best.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.773
Ezekiel...

24:50.739 --> 24:52.573
I need to learn some engineering.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.792
The pipeline... we would have stuck with

24:54.793 --> 24:56.794
your basic metal-seated ball valve,

24:56.795 --> 24:59.797
but these boys got fancy with
an isolated solenoid valve.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.582
Quantum overload must
have blown the actuator.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.886
Don't touch that, man. It's hot.

25:04.887 --> 25:07.805
Let me show you how to do a pipe bleed.

25:07.806 --> 25:09.974
Now you show me.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.500
Invalid entry code. Access denied.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.572
I need to learn physics.

25:24.573 --> 25:26.607
So, that shade of red is 440 Terahertz.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.409
That's a high "A." So, you can...

25:28.410 --> 25:29.777
Match the signal frequency

25:29.778 --> 25:31.946
by rewiring into a
different power point, right?

25:31.947 --> 25:35.082
Good. Just watch the voltage drop.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.620
Warning. Access panel open.

25:39.621 --> 25:43.541
Courtyard entry. Access granted.

25:54.937 --> 25:56.721
Big arena fight.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.822
There's gotta be a Save
Point past that door.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.497
Jones, what the hell?!

26:23.498 --> 26:24.799
I need you to teach me how to fight.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.050
Hey!

26:26.051 --> 26:29.337
Seriously?

26:29.338 --> 26:31.088
I know, right?

26:31.089 --> 26:33.674
- You still got those grenades?
- Won't work in here. I've tried.

26:33.675 --> 26:38.429
Okay. Welcome to urban tactics 101.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.930
You're gonna want to move from here

26:39.931 --> 26:41.932
to that central stand to
control their attack vectors.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.434
Baseball bat is a lousy weapon.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.019
All the force is in the top 8 inches.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.855
But if you know that,

26:47.856 --> 26:50.825
you can do some damage with it.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.076
Ready?

27:14.016 --> 27:15.933
Seriously?

27:15.934 --> 27:17.635
We've made it to the central stand

27:17.636 --> 27:19.553
a couple times, but they all... Jones.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.605
What if we split up and try and draw...

27:21.606 --> 27:24.392
Ezekiel...

27:24.393 --> 27:25.776
How many times?

27:25.777 --> 27:28.446
I've stopped counting.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.818
There's a story soldiers tell...

27:33.819 --> 27:35.069
World War II, Market Garden,

27:35.070 --> 27:36.787
Allied assault behind enemy lines.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.122
What happens is,

27:38.123 --> 27:41.709
these allied troops have to cross a river.

27:41.710 --> 27:44.462
First wave of soldiers get
in their little pontoon boats,

27:44.463 --> 27:45.830
get halfway across the river,

27:45.831 --> 27:48.049
and the Germans just
open up their machine guns

27:48.050 --> 27:49.467
and just cut them all down.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.135
None of them make it.

27:51.136 --> 27:52.753
These two colonels

27:52.754 --> 27:54.588
are watching the bodies
floating in the river,

27:54.589 --> 27:55.973
and one of them says,

27:55.974 --> 27:58.976
"those are the bravest men I've ever seen."

27:58.977 --> 28:01.896
The second colonel points to
the second wave of soldiers

28:01.897 --> 28:03.931
getting in their little pontoon boats,

28:03.932 --> 28:05.983
getting ready to cross the same river,

28:05.984 --> 28:08.486
only they saw what
happened to the first guys.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.021
They know what's coming.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.941
And that colonel says, "no.

28:13.942 --> 28:18.863
Those are the bravest men I've ever seen."

28:18.864 --> 28:21.782
I've lost count of the amount of
times you've told me that story.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.501
Why'd you let me tell it again?

28:23.502 --> 28:25.768
I like the way you look
at me when you tell it.

28:33.898 --> 28:36.347
- Hey!
- It's not gonna work.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.438
Even if I can fight my way to that door,

28:38.439 --> 28:41.107
there's no way I can get all
four of us across to that room.

28:41.108 --> 28:43.142
And a single mistake
in any of those spots...

28:43.143 --> 28:44.811
Ezekiel, as your friend,

28:44.812 --> 28:48.181
I am concerned about you locking
the rest of us in a small room.

28:48.182 --> 28:49.766
Hey, Jones, come here.

28:49.767 --> 28:51.234
Jones!

28:51.235 --> 28:52.735
Come listen to me right now, okay?

28:52.736 --> 28:54.237
Hey, you let us out.

28:54.238 --> 28:56.522
Out?

28:56.523 --> 28:58.658
"The best way out is always through."

28:58.659 --> 29:01.744
To get through the level, I
have to get out of the level.

29:01.745 --> 29:04.614
Stone, you're a genius.

29:04.615 --> 29:06.783
When did he start reading Robert Frost?

29:06.784 --> 29:09.836
J-Jones! Jones!

29:09.837 --> 29:11.588
Access granted.

30:00.721 --> 30:02.588
I did it! I made it!

30:04.091 --> 30:06.426
And maybe I crashed the game.

30:12.733 --> 30:14.817
I've got it. I know the way out.

30:14.818 --> 30:16.402
What are you talking about?

30:16.403 --> 30:17.737
This isn't the Annex.
We're still in the base.

30:17.738 --> 30:20.440
Why are we still here?

30:20.441 --> 30:21.908
Why's this place trashed?

30:21.909 --> 30:23.693
Really? Still?

30:25.612 --> 30:27.864
Right. We're trapped in
a video game Save Point.

30:27.865 --> 30:30.116
Each time one of us dies, it resets, okay?

30:30.117 --> 30:32.452
But the game is crashing,
and I know the way out.

30:32.453 --> 30:34.837
So if you want to live, follow me.

30:34.838 --> 30:36.756
Back through the door...

30:36.757 --> 30:38.875
Can't help but notice you're not following.

30:38.876 --> 30:41.627
If we are in a time loop,
how many fingers am I...

30:41.628 --> 30:44.029
Fine. We do it the long way.

30:46.633 --> 30:49.635
The health pack.

30:49.636 --> 30:50.937
I-it's gone. No, no, no.

30:50.938 --> 30:52.772
I need that to make you guys believe me.

30:52.773 --> 30:54.607
It's the only way you guys ever do.

30:54.608 --> 30:56.809
The rager general... he's right over here.

30:56.810 --> 30:59.278
Come here. I'll show you.

30:59.279 --> 31:02.482
Okay, Ezekiel, you are
not making any sense.

31:02.483 --> 31:04.701
He's not here.

31:04.702 --> 31:06.486
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:06.487 --> 31:09.572
You need to do exactly as I
say and follow me right now.

31:09.573 --> 31:11.240
All right, this is crazy.

31:11.241 --> 31:13.459
The world is just crashing all around us,

31:13.460 --> 31:15.745
and... and you guys won't take me seriously

31:15.746 --> 31:18.498
because you guys think I'm...

31:18.499 --> 31:20.550
Me.

31:20.551 --> 31:23.386
You think I'm me.

31:24.805 --> 31:27.507
- What was that?
- Uh, Cassandra, what was that?

31:27.508 --> 31:30.510
It's a glitch in the game,

31:30.511 --> 31:33.513
and I caused it trying to save you.

31:33.514 --> 31:36.516
I know that sounds crazy.

31:36.517 --> 31:37.850
And I know that you all think of me

31:37.851 --> 31:41.521
as your irresponsible little brother.

31:41.522 --> 31:43.740
But right now we are in danger.

31:43.741 --> 31:46.576
And I don't know how
to make you believe me,

31:46.577 --> 31:48.277
so I need you to trust me.

31:48.278 --> 31:49.612
Jones.

31:49.613 --> 31:52.198
No, I'm not your friend,

31:52.199 --> 31:53.750
but you're all my friends.

31:53.751 --> 31:55.952
You've been my friends...
it's impossible to explain...

31:55.953 --> 31:57.552
for so long.

32:00.541 --> 32:03.459
You once told me about Old Man Murphy,

32:03.460 --> 32:05.795
the old pipe monkey that taught
you how to first use a wrench

32:05.796 --> 32:09.265
when you worked the pipelines.

32:09.266 --> 32:12.385
Cassandra, I know how
much you love getting lost

32:12.386 --> 32:14.604
in the math of something so deep

32:14.605 --> 32:17.557
that you forget about
how unfair your tumor,

32:17.558 --> 32:20.226
about how unfair the universe
is, and just for one moment,

32:20.227 --> 32:23.044
everything makes sense. Makes sense.

32:27.534 --> 32:30.536
Eve...

32:30.537 --> 32:32.288
I know what Private Lee's widow told you

32:32.289 --> 32:35.840
when you handed her that flag.

32:37.327 --> 32:40.797
I have seen you all die so many times

32:40.798 --> 32:42.748
when it didn't matter.

32:42.749 --> 32:44.550
I can't... I can't let it happen now,

32:44.551 --> 32:45.918
when it actually does.

32:45.919 --> 32:47.837
So, please...

32:47.838 --> 32:51.007
Please, just this once,

32:51.008 --> 32:53.024
let me be the big brother.

32:54.761 --> 32:56.494
What do you need us to do?

32:58.899 --> 33:00.399
Speed run.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.568
Cassandra, the Thaumatite is held

33:02.569 --> 33:04.403
in an EM containment
field, like for plasma,

33:04.404 --> 33:06.439
- but with magnetic mirrors on both sides.
- Gotcha.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.908
I gotta figure out a way to
bleed off some of this pressure.

33:08.909 --> 33:10.660
There's a shutoff on the third line.

33:10.661 --> 33:12.778
The vacuum effect will
super-cool the adjacent pipes,

33:12.779 --> 33:14.447
allow you to access the flow controls.

33:14.448 --> 33:15.781
I wouldn't have thought of that.

33:15.782 --> 33:17.283
You did... eventually.

33:17.284 --> 33:19.535
They're coming!

33:19.536 --> 33:22.338
We're climbing a pipe? Are
we playing a platformer?

33:22.339 --> 33:23.956
Uh, no. We're cheating.

33:23.957 --> 33:25.523
Follow me.

33:34.935 --> 33:36.952
You guys good?

33:38.105 --> 33:39.639
Right. Let's end this game.

33:47.879 --> 33:49.395
You guys good?

33:50.548 --> 33:51.915
Right. Let's end this game.

33:57.792 --> 33:59.126
It's too far to jump.

33:59.127 --> 34:00.711
I don't suppose you got some rope?

34:00.712 --> 34:02.746
No...

34:02.747 --> 34:04.131
But I have these.

34:04.132 --> 34:06.834
- That is not rope.
- We're gonna rocket jump.

34:06.835 --> 34:08.969
You jump, and I throw
the grenade at your feet.

34:08.969 --> 34:11.004
The blast of the grenade
will give you enough push

34:11.005 --> 34:12.505
to make it over the pit.

34:12.507 --> 34:14.842
That is not how grenades work!

34:14.842 --> 34:17.594
Not in real life, but
we're in a video game.

34:17.594 --> 34:20.746
Rocket jumping is a
time-honored tradition.

34:25.603 --> 34:26.853
Just run and jump?

34:26.855 --> 34:29.523
Just run and jump.

34:29.524 --> 34:32.675
I'm out of my mind. I'm out
of my mind. I'm out of my mind.

34:39.083 --> 34:41.752
I'll be damned.

34:41.753 --> 34:43.036
Come on!

34:45.706 --> 34:48.041
Okay, just wait an extra
half-second before you throw it.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.710
The shock wave dispersal should
make for a smoother landing.

34:50.712 --> 34:53.062
Any landing you can walk away from.

34:58.219 --> 34:59.803
Uhh!

35:03.558 --> 35:04.858
All right.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.778
Try not to kill me with that thing.

35:07.779 --> 35:10.063
I think I've killed you enough for one day.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.842
Uhh!

35:30.919 --> 35:33.837
All right, Jones! Your turn, buddy!

35:33.838 --> 35:36.223
Just toss it gently in front of you.

35:36.224 --> 35:39.259
You should be able to
ride the blast like that.

35:39.260 --> 35:41.178
Not gonna be a blast for me, guys.

35:41.179 --> 35:42.695
What are you talking about?

35:45.350 --> 35:48.018
Only had three grenades left.

35:48.019 --> 35:51.021
But you can't jump that far by yourself.

35:51.022 --> 35:53.774
Probably not, but it's worth a go.

35:53.775 --> 35:57.661
All right, well, if you
die, then it just resets.

35:57.662 --> 35:59.029
No. Look around.

35:59.030 --> 36:01.949
It'll crash before it resets.

36:01.950 --> 36:04.284
But you guys won't. You
guys have been saved.

36:04.285 --> 36:06.753
I saved you.

36:06.754 --> 36:08.171
Ezekiel.

36:08.172 --> 36:10.090
Hey. It's all right.

36:10.091 --> 36:11.875
I'm Ezekiel Jones.

36:11.876 --> 36:14.678
Ezekiel Jones doesn't lose.

36:14.679 --> 36:16.479
Good game, mates.

36:21.853 --> 36:23.687
- Hey. Hey!
- No!

36:41.456 --> 36:44.157
We're... we're here. We're back.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.346
Where's Ezekiel?

36:52.834 --> 36:55.017
He gave his life for us.

36:57.305 --> 37:02.009
Ezekiel Jones gave his life for us.

37:02.010 --> 37:04.344
No.

37:04.345 --> 37:06.480
There's gotta be something we can do.

37:06.481 --> 37:08.181
When a game crashes, you restart it.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.850
We could do something from here.

37:09.851 --> 37:11.184
Yeah.

37:11.185 --> 37:12.903
If we reinitialize the system,

37:12.904 --> 37:14.187
we should be able to create

37:14.188 --> 37:15.906
a quantum-field superposition state

37:15.907 --> 37:17.240
that can bring him back.

37:17.241 --> 37:20.160
He said it was a magnetic
containment field.

37:20.161 --> 37:23.697
You put this back, it
should realign itself.

37:23.698 --> 37:24.915
We're gonna need coolant.

37:24.916 --> 37:26.249
He told me where the shutoff valves were.

37:26.250 --> 37:27.850
I can... I can access the flow controls.

37:33.374 --> 37:36.927
Okay. Here we go.

37:47.772 --> 37:50.140
Jones!

37:51.442 --> 37:53.310
You're alive.

37:53.311 --> 37:54.728
You're back.

37:55.947 --> 37:58.065
Back... where?

37:58.066 --> 37:59.366
Back what?

37:59.367 --> 38:01.485
You don't remember anything?

38:01.486 --> 38:03.737
He didn't make it to the Save Point.

38:03.738 --> 38:06.907
He's an unsaved game.

38:06.908 --> 38:09.175
Who are you people?

38:12.246 --> 38:14.063
We're Librarians.

38:15.466 --> 38:18.851
Oh. Thank God you're here.

38:20.221 --> 38:23.090
I'm a what now?!

38:26.344 --> 38:28.762
Jenkins thinks the DARPA personnel

38:28.763 --> 38:30.430
should make a full recovery.

38:30.431 --> 38:34.484
Ah, yes. And now with the
Thaumatite "breakthrough"

38:34.485 --> 38:36.019
in our possession,

38:36.020 --> 38:37.904
DARPA will have to
develop quantum computing

38:37.905 --> 38:39.205
without cheating.

38:41.075 --> 38:43.443
I really did all that stuff?

38:43.444 --> 38:44.911
And probably more.

38:44.912 --> 38:46.246
I mean, we only remember the final loop,

38:46.247 --> 38:47.531
so who knows what else you did in there?

38:47.532 --> 38:50.450
You were... a different you...

38:50.451 --> 38:53.503
mature, commanding, serious.

38:53.504 --> 38:55.005
Kind of badass.

38:55.006 --> 38:56.456
You were a hero.

38:56.457 --> 38:58.842
No. That doesn't sound like me.

38:58.843 --> 39:00.460
Meaning?

39:00.461 --> 39:02.212
You guys are putting me on.

39:02.213 --> 39:04.548
A little fun at my expense. I get it.

39:04.549 --> 39:08.802
So, you finally turn into
a halfway decent person,

39:08.803 --> 39:10.353
you're not gonna own up to it?

39:10.354 --> 39:12.606
A halfway decent person?

39:12.607 --> 39:16.143
Sounds like a step down from
all awesome, don't you think?

39:16.144 --> 39:21.413
Well, you may not know what
you're capable of, but we do.

39:37.632 --> 39:41.600
Your sheep returned, shepherd, as have I.

39:42.970 --> 39:44.387
Care to tell me how

39:44.388 --> 39:46.423
the military got their
hands on a piece of Atlantis

39:46.424 --> 39:49.226
that should have been buried
at the bottom of the ocean?

39:49.227 --> 39:53.096
Would you rather have that
answer than the tale I tell?

39:53.097 --> 39:55.982
For I've traveled under stars and over seas

39:55.983 --> 39:58.101
to bring it to thee.

39:58.102 --> 40:00.320
I'll have my answers.

40:00.321 --> 40:03.356
Prospero's goal is far from foul.

40:03.357 --> 40:06.193
'Tis joy for every mortal soul he seeks.

40:06.194 --> 40:07.611
Oh, yes,

40:07.612 --> 40:10.030
and drowning 7 million
people in Manhattan...

40:10.031 --> 40:12.365
such a heartwarming opening move.

40:12.366 --> 40:15.335
He knows the library stands against him.

40:15.336 --> 40:17.204
He fears your librarians.

40:17.205 --> 40:21.541
Prospero must remove your heroes
before he rules o'er this world.

40:21.542 --> 40:23.260
How? When?

40:23.261 --> 40:26.096
You have but one answer left, Galeas.

40:26.097 --> 40:27.380
Which shall it be?

40:29.217 --> 40:32.602
I doubt he will be subtle, so... when?

40:32.603 --> 40:34.137
Now.

40:34.138 --> 40:36.056
Yes, tell me now. Now, sprite.

40:36.057 --> 40:39.226
No, the answer... 'tis now.

40:39.227 --> 40:41.228
Right... now!

40:43.064 --> 40:45.949
I abjure and banish you,

40:45.950 --> 40:47.450
foul Puck!

40:53.074 --> 40:54.324
What?

40:54.325 --> 40:55.992
Colonel Baird, don't! Don't!

40:55.993 --> 40:58.344
It's a trap! Don't!

41:00.715 --> 41:04.167
Where? What? Why... why... why go there?

41:04.168 --> 41:06.769
There's no reason to go...

41:15.563 --> 41:17.314
Oh! Tsch!

41:17.315 --> 41:18.982
There it is.

41:18.983 --> 41:21.067
Been a dragon, it would have bit me.
