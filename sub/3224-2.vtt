WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:04.891
Abaddon.
She's a demon.

00:04.920 --> 00:06.604
Who, turns out,
is a Knight of Hell.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.966
Knights of Hell
are hand-picked

00:08.039 --> 00:09.485
by Lucifer himself.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.210
- I am your king.
- About that.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.447
Right now, you and I are gonna
talk about a regime change.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.040
How do I stop?

00:28.080 --> 00:29.605
Just let it go.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.360
We'll figure it out.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.890
- Ah!
- Sam?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.644
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.927
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.327
This is Dean Winchester.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.640
And I need your help.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.131
Easy there, brother.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.527
I heard your prayer.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.931
And I am here to help.

00:55.960 --> 00:56.927
You want to help?

00:56.960 --> 00:57.961
Start with a name.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.201
Ezekiel.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.200
No, we had a deal.
I fight, you save!

01:09.280 --> 01:11.647
There is a chance I can fix
your brother. From the inside.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.289
How would it work?

01:12.320 --> 01:13.970
I heal Sam,
while healing myself.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.206
And when he's healed?

01:15.280 --> 01:16.281
I leave.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.681
He's gonna wake up, right?

01:18.760 --> 01:20.330
- He will.
- So, when he does, what...

01:20.400 --> 01:21.760
What, is he gonna
feel you, inside,

01:21.800 --> 01:22.847
triaging his spleen?

01:22.880 --> 01:24.120
He will not feel me, no.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.481
There's no reason for him
to know I'm in here at all.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.127
Without his acceptance,
Sam can eject me at any time.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.845
And if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.848
Then, we keep it
a secret for now.

01:58.520 --> 02:02.047
So, what, Cass is human?

02:02.120 --> 02:03.565
Ish.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.530
I mean, he's got
no grace, no wings, no...

02:08.039 --> 02:09.723
...harp,
whatever the hell else he had.

02:09.759 --> 02:10.727
Okay.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.762
And where did he crash-land?

02:12.840 --> 02:15.650
Called me from a payphone,
from Longmont, Colorado.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.006
I told him just to make
for the bunker.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.202
You think he can handle
a road trip like that?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.401
Cass is a big boy.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.284
Things go Breaking Bad,
he knows our number.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.204
Right now, I got bigger worries.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.571
What, fallen angels?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.887
Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.967
Anyway, thanks to Metatron,

02:31.040 --> 02:32.680
we now have
a couple of thousand confused,

02:32.720 --> 02:35.849
loose nukes
walking around down here.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.280
What do you think
they're gonna do?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.444
I got no damn clue.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.646
What about Crowley?

02:42.720 --> 02:44.085
You, uh...

02:46.440 --> 02:49.728
I would've loved nothing better
than to ice that limey bitch.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.761
But then, I thought to myself,

02:50.840 --> 02:54.561
"What would
Sam Winchester do?"

02:54.600 --> 02:55.886
I'd, uh...

02:55.920 --> 02:57.888
stabbed him in the brain.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.081
Oh...

03:01.720 --> 03:03.768
Well, I figured the King of Hell
might know a few things,

03:03.840 --> 03:05.842
so, why not
Zero Dark Thirty his ass?

03:09.320 --> 03:10.401
Wait...

03:10.440 --> 03:13.603
So Crowley is alive?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.849
Oh, yeah.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.445
He's the junk in my trunk.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.805
Huh!

03:55.080 --> 03:56.491
Oh!

04:30.360 --> 04:32.249
The hell?

04:32.320 --> 04:33.765
Dean?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.171
You're alive!

04:35.200 --> 04:37.601
Yeah,
because you're a crappy shot...

04:37.680 --> 04:39.364
Katniss.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.686
Sorry.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.882
It's been a bad couple of days.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.203
I haven't slept, or eaten.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.362
Pretty backed-up.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.890
Okay, over-share.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.649
After we talked,
this place went nuts.

04:51.720 --> 04:52.926
All right, there was some alarm

04:53.000 --> 04:54.729
and all the machines
were freaking out and the...

04:54.800 --> 04:56.040
the bunker just locked down.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.849
I couldn't open the door,
my cell phone stopped working.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.166
I thought the world was ending.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.407
Close.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.370
The angels fell.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.925
The...

05:07.000 --> 05:08.411
What does that mean?

05:10.240 --> 05:11.924
Nothing good.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.566
Listen, next time
the world's ending,

05:14.640 --> 05:15.687
grab a gun.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.008
I got service.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.086
It's back online.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.684
Maybe when you opened the door
from the outside door,

05:32.760 --> 05:34.046
it reset the system.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.280
Yeah, okay, let's go with that.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.647
Hey, all good?

05:40.600 --> 05:41.522
Is it ever?

05:41.600 --> 05:42.601
Come on.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.721
No.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.405
Ow!

05:55.600 --> 05:57.090
Hello.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.411
Never get tired of doing that.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.961
Oh!

06:06.160 --> 06:07.730
Homey.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.404
Where did you get this fantastic

06:09.440 --> 06:10.646
little treehouse?

06:10.680 --> 06:11.966
All right, here's how
it's gonna go.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.929
You're giving us the name
of every demon on Earth

06:13.960 --> 06:15.405
and the people
they're possessing.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.010
Am I?

06:17.080 --> 06:18.241
Doesn't sound like me.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.681
I saw you break down, Crowley.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.841
When I was trying to cure you,

06:21.920 --> 06:23.365
I know a part of you
was human again,

06:23.440 --> 06:24.441
maybe still is.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.970
Blah, blah, boo-hoo.

06:26.000 --> 06:26.967
Done?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.525
Okay.

06:28.600 --> 06:34.209
Because this is what I know.
I'm not giving you anything.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.441
Why would I?

06:35.480 --> 06:37.926
You have no leverage, darlings.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.126
You're not gonna
close the Gates of Hell,

06:39.160 --> 06:40.127
because you didn't.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.288
You're not gonna kill me,
because you haven't.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.651
So what's left?

06:43.680 --> 06:46.047
We have a few ideas.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.167
Torture?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.326
Brilliant.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.165
Can't wait to see
Sam in stilettos

06:51.200 --> 06:52.531
and a leather bustier,

06:52.640 --> 06:58.329
really putting
the S-A-M into S and M.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.606
Honestly, boys.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.602
What are you gonna do to me

07:00.680 --> 07:02.489
that I don't do to myself,
just for kicks,

07:02.520 --> 07:04.682
every Friday night?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.206
Have fun.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.370
Hm...

07:35.720 --> 07:37.609
What's Crowley doing here?
Why isn't he dead?

07:37.680 --> 07:38.602
Why aren't you stabbing him
right now?

07:38.680 --> 07:39.886
All right, all right,
chill out, Kevin, okay?

07:39.920 --> 07:41.331
- We need him.
- What?

07:41.360 --> 07:42.885
Kevin, look.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.046
If we can get Crowley to give us

07:44.120 --> 07:46.407
the name of every demon
he's got top-side,

07:46.480 --> 07:47.561
we can hunt them down.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.681
All of them.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.165
He will break, okay?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.043
And when he does,
we'll hold him down,

07:52.080 --> 07:53.650
while you knife him.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.688
Then we all go out
for ice cream and strippers.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.725
Just stay away
from him, all right?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.041
So now what?

08:03.080 --> 08:04.605
I got to make some phone calls.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.806
You need to hit
the angel tablet,

08:05.920 --> 08:07.046
see if you can find
anything on the spell

08:07.080 --> 08:08.286
that Metatron used
to empty out Heaven.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.691
And maybe
we can reverse it

08:09.720 --> 08:11.051
before the God Squad
does too much damage.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.047
If we're lucky.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.889
All right, check the net
for anything angel-y.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
Or demon-y.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.248
Or monster-y or ghost-y.
Or...

08:18.280 --> 08:19.645
It's gonna be a busy year.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.529
My name is Abaddon.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.925
But enough about me,
let's talk you.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.128
Jason tells me
you're all violent,

08:30.200 --> 08:32.645
power-hungry opportunists.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.200
So, maybe you can tell me,

08:35.280 --> 08:39.205
what the hell happened to Hell?

08:39.240 --> 08:41.890
And demons. I mean...

08:42.159 --> 08:44.606
You call that a meat-suit?

08:44.640 --> 08:47.723
I closed 72 deals last year.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.205
Kids love Grandma.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.248
And that's the problem.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.567
Deals.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.968
We're paying
for what we should be taking!

08:59.320 --> 09:00.890
Who put Crowley in charge?

09:03.600 --> 09:04.965
What's the matter?
Hell-hound got your tongue?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.047
You took orders from him!

09:06.120 --> 09:07.451
He's the King!

09:07.480 --> 09:08.561
He's a salesman!

09:10.400 --> 09:12.164
A king fights.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.124
A king conquers.

09:15.240 --> 09:21.691
A king does more than
sit around, reading contracts.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.046
But the King's dead.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.011
Long live the Queen.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.364
I can train you.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.363
I can get you new bodies.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.965
And we will march into Hell,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.604
where we will be
greeted as liberators.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.531
And demonkind will rise up
and sweep over the Earth.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.489
And all the humans
and all the angels,

09:40.600 --> 09:42.841
with their clipped wings,
will bow to me!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.924
Or they will burn.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.162
What about Crowley?

09:49.200 --> 09:50.531
Crowley's dead.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.847
Uh-huh.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.844
Well, uh, no offense, honey,

09:57.920 --> 09:59.046
but we all thought
you were dead,

09:59.160 --> 10:02.323
until, like, a week ago.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.089
And what if Crowley
does come back?

10:04.160 --> 10:07.084
Look, a lot of us,
we're scared of him.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.366
A lot of us still are.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.367
Prove that Crowley's
really gone,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.846
and then maybe this scheme
of yours will work.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.601
Or not.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.328
Honestly,

10:22.360 --> 10:25.648
I always thought
you Knights were overrated.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.688
You go to Hell.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.609
And you tell them

10:32.680 --> 10:33.841
I'm coming.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.565
Yeah, Irv, fallen angels.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.085
That's a wrinkle.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.885
Well, trust me, they're
just monsters with good PR.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.163
So, if you run into one,
torch his ass with holy oil.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.766
Oh, and if they drop, like,

10:49.840 --> 10:51.569
a silver sword, grab it,

10:51.640 --> 10:52.527
those pig-stickers come in handy.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.050
Okay. Criminy.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.605
Hey, look, I know this is weird.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.523
Hell, Deano,
weird's what we do.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.971
I remember this
case me and Bobby worked

10:59.040 --> 11:00.121
up in Saskatoon,
and these two...

11:00.200 --> 11:03.044
Werewolf Siamese twins?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.161
He told you about that?

11:04.240 --> 11:06.766
Every time he drank Labatts.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.881
So, if you run
into any problems,

11:07.920 --> 11:09.046
give a call, okay?

11:09.080 --> 11:10.366
And, uh, spread the word.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.367
The more hunters that know,
the better.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.487
Roger-dodger.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.089
So it's your first weekend pass
into town, right?

11:22.280 --> 11:23.202
Let's set it all up.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.362
Jamie's waiting at the bar
and has a thing

11:25.440 --> 11:26.441
for men in uniform.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.721
So, just start buying shots.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.921
Then you can thank me
in the morning.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.087
Cool.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.721
Now that is more like it.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.971
Need some help?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.809
Uh, yeah.

12:32.840 --> 12:38.006
I don't know,
I think the thingy broke.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.690
Well, I could give you
a lift into town.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.650
That would be amazing.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.364
Thanks.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.247
Nice hunting.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.524
God.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.130
This place reeks of sulphur.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.766
The stink, with the freak
thunderstorms and...

13:27.840 --> 13:29.569
Every cow dead
within three miles...

13:29.640 --> 13:31.120
I'll take demons
for a thousand, Alex.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.721
Hi.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.768
Agents Stark and Banner, FBI.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.126
Just need to have a look around.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.690
Why?

13:38.720 --> 13:40.404
This is a military case,
not a federal one.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.044
Well, that's not
what our supervisor said.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.525
That so?

13:43.560 --> 13:45.483
Then, maybe him and I
ought to have a chat.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
Hm...

13:48.200 --> 13:49.361
Okay.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.047
Hey.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.969
Hey, boss.
We got a little problem here.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.040
Boss?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.242
Yeah, just local badge
needs confirmation

14:01.280 --> 14:02.884
we're supposed to be here.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.331
How the word came down from

14:04.400 --> 14:05.731
FBI headquarters in DC?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.171
Wait, what, what?

14:07.280 --> 14:08.441
Yeah.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.884
This is Sergeant Miranda Bates.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.490
Who am I talking to?

14:14.560 --> 14:18.121
Uh... Kevin Solo.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.680
How old are you?

14:24.920 --> 14:26.001
Old enough.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.080
And I'm with the FBI,

14:27.120 --> 14:28.485
so you have to do
what I say or...

14:28.560 --> 14:30.562
Listen, kid.
I don't have to do anything.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.170
And I don't take orders
from the Feeb.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.605
So unless you can
give me one good reason

14:33.640 --> 14:35.768
you got a couple of pretty-boy
agents poking around

14:35.800 --> 14:37.480
my crime scene,
I'm gonna put them in cuffs

14:37.560 --> 14:39.642
and spank your ass raw,
understand?

14:41.320 --> 14:42.765
Cabo, last June.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.847
What?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.922
That's my reason.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.882
Oh, my favorite's
you wearing a sombrero

14:49.960 --> 14:52.531
and doing a body-shot off some
naked guy in a luchador mask.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.761
Super classy.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.881
How did you find that?

14:57.120 --> 14:59.600
'Cause I'm Kevin frickin' Solo.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.641
So unless you want
this forwarded

15:00.720 --> 15:03.166
to your commanding officer,
Major Velasquez,

15:03.200 --> 15:04.964
I suggest you give my guys
anything they want.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.002
Understand?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.201
Yes.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.200
Kevin?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.651
What the hell did you just do?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.408
All military computers
are linked to the same network.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.209
And?

15:31.280 --> 15:32.280
I hacked it.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.971
Hey, Kevin?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.525
Good job, buddy.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.164
Hey. Anything?

15:43.200 --> 15:45.123
Yeah, this guy was shot
in the heart.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.326
That what killed him?

15:46.360 --> 15:47.566
Maybe.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.641
Fifteen, 20 years ago.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.842
Every one of these bodies
has a fatal wound

15:50.880 --> 15:52.769
or two or three,
but they're all old.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.320
So we're looking
at meat-suits.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.885
Bodies took a lickin'

15:56.960 --> 15:58.440
and the demon inside
kept 'em tickin'.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.720
Probably.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.364
I think they were possessed.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.130
And now those soldiers are.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.326
Hey.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.050
Excuse me, agents,

16:06.080 --> 16:07.764
we pulled this off
a security camera.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.410
You might want to take a look.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.325
Abaddon?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.402
Seriously?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.766
I thought you Kentucky
fried that meat-suit.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.841
- I did, Dean.
- You...

16:22.880 --> 16:24.041
Well, then,
how'd she get it back?

16:24.080 --> 16:25.764
Thank you.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.887
And why's she playing G.I. Joes?

16:26.920 --> 16:27.887
No clue.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.921
Why don't you ask her
when we find her?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.968
Oh, I will. And then I'm gonna
chop her frickin' head off...

16:31.040 --> 16:32.121
again.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.920
All right, Pete...

16:40.000 --> 16:41.604
the Winchesters, where are they?

16:43.360 --> 16:44.486
Bite me.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.445
I said,
where are the Winchesters?

16:48.480 --> 16:51.290
And I said, bite me,
crew-cut.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.001
Let me show you
how it's done, boys.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.970
Help me! Ah!

17:05.040 --> 17:07.441
Help!

17:07.640 --> 17:10.325
You can scream all you want to.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.084
No one's gonna hear you!

17:14.119 --> 17:15.723
Now let's talk Sam and Dean.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.444
Hello?

17:26.480 --> 17:28.561
This is Dean's number.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.086
But you're not a Winchester.
Who are you?

17:31.120 --> 17:32.087
I'm...

17:32.120 --> 17:34.327
nobody.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.601
Well, nobody.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.371
I need you to give those boys
a message for me.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.322
I have something
they might want.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.369
Kevin, wait, wait, wait,
slow down.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.726
She gave me these coordinates.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.207
44.053051,

17:54.280 --> 17:56.965
by negative 123.427860.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.207
And two names,
Irv Franklin and Tracy Bell.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.850
Irv's a friend,
don't know Tracy.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.809
All right, the lady said
they were hunters

18:02.840 --> 18:04.808
and that if you
didn't go save them,

18:04.840 --> 18:05.807
that she would kill them.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.001
Yeah, I've heard
that song before.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.730
Dean, who was she?

18:08.800 --> 18:09.800
She's the bad guy.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.280
All right, new job,
dig up everything

18:11.360 --> 18:13.010
Men of Letters
have on Knights of Hell.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.080
Knights of Hell.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.080
Sure.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.121
You find a way to kill one,

18:17.160 --> 18:18.160
I mean, permanently,

18:18.200 --> 18:19.201
drop a dime.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.526
Thanks, Kevin.

18:23.680 --> 18:27.765
The numbers point to a spot on
the outskirts of Eugene, Oregon.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.490
You know this is a trap, right?

18:29.520 --> 18:31.010
Yup.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.361
And we're just
gonna walk right into it?

18:33.440 --> 18:34.680
Guns blazin'.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.041
You with me?

18:37.120 --> 18:38.246
You know it.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.360
You are the third trial.

18:49.480 --> 18:50.720
Where...

18:52.040 --> 18:53.565
do I start...

18:53.600 --> 18:55.090
You're our bitch.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.084
...to even look
for forgiveness?

18:58.160 --> 19:01.209
Your demon ass
is going to be a mortal ass.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.207
Pretty damn boink.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.446
None of this means
anything to you?

19:03.520 --> 19:05.568
And Hannah,

19:05.600 --> 19:08.729
she just...
she needs to be loved.

19:08.760 --> 19:09.841
She deserves it.

19:09.880 --> 19:14.204
I deserve to be loved,
I deserve to be loved!

19:14.240 --> 19:15.571
I just want to be loved.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.250
I just want to be loved.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.081
Kevin?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.761
Kevin, I know it's you.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.729
I'd recognize
the pitter-patter of those

19:38.760 --> 19:40.091
little feet anywhere.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.646
That's right.

19:43.720 --> 19:44.721
Run.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.569
It's what you do.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.084
I understand, I do.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.282
You're...
What's the word?

19:55.120 --> 19:56.121
Weak.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.211
Hiya, Kev.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.680
What the hell happened here?

20:10.760 --> 20:13.604
Local chemical plant
sprung a leak, years ago.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.483
They evacuated
three square blocks.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.760
Guess it's still contaminated.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.644
What, so this whole place is
poisoned?

20:19.720 --> 20:20.721
Yeah.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.161
That's not gonna help.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.881
It doesn't hurt.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.803
Dean.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.841
Irv?

20:46.920 --> 20:49.287
Hey...

20:49.320 --> 20:50.651
Where's Abaddon?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.967
Abaddon's been
torturing hunters.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.570
She's trying to get
intel on you boys.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.766
Do you know why?

20:55.840 --> 20:57.285
I seriously doubt
she wants to add you

20:57.320 --> 20:58.446
to her Christmas card list.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.602
Now you want to make
with the rescue or what?

21:00.680 --> 21:02.523
Right after you take a shot
of holy water, man.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.246
Happy?

21:10.320 --> 21:11.321
Sorry about that.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.327
Don't worry about it.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.727
Last thing you need is us
popping black eyes.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.762
Tracy, right?
I'm Sam Winchester.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.211
Good for you.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.167
She's new.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.885
We did a shifter job
in Sacramento together.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.724
Smart.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.205
Got a mouth on her.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.760
Let's gear up.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.246
So...

21:36.320 --> 21:39.051
what brings you
to my boudoir, handsome?

21:39.120 --> 21:41.361
You're gonna tell me
how to kill a Knight of Hell.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.050
Abaddon givin' you trouble, eh?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.051
Tell you what, you let me go

21:46.120 --> 21:48.043
and I'll spit-roast
the little whore for you.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.286
Sound good?

21:49.360 --> 21:50.566
You're bluffing.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.244
You don't know.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.446
Oh, I know plenty.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.887
For example,
I know she'd love you.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.970
Skinny, submissive.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.087
You're just her type.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.160
Shut up.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.531
Fine.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.767
That's not what you came for,
anyway, not really.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.004
What's on your mind, Kevin?

22:10.520 --> 22:11.760
You can tell me.

22:11.840 --> 22:12.887
We're friends.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.048
You tortured me.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.082
I torture all my friends.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.770
It's how I show love.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.729
I was raised in a dysfunctional
home environment.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.922
You killed my mom!

22:25.960 --> 22:27.007
Did I?

22:28.960 --> 22:31.645
I mean, are you sure?

22:31.720 --> 22:33.290
Did you ever see a body?

22:33.360 --> 22:35.328
I mean, how can you be sure
she's dead?

22:35.600 --> 22:36.600
Ah!

22:43.280 --> 22:45.282
You can do better than that,
little man.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.641
That's right.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.489
Let it all out.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.802
All right, we got Jesus juice,

23:02.840 --> 23:04.842
guns loaded
with devil's trap bullets.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.651
Shoot a demon,
put him on lockdown.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.131
Angel blade works.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.762
They're coming.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.881
Good.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.051
They've got assault rifles.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.610
Okay, less good.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.801
So...

23:21.840 --> 23:23.080
what's the play?

23:25.400 --> 23:28.165
Come and get it, you dicks!

23:28.240 --> 23:29.526
Down, now!

23:32.000 --> 23:33.729
Come and get it, you dicks!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.729
Come and get it, you dicks!

23:38.800 --> 23:40.040
Damn it.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.690
All right.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.842
We got a flank SEAL Team Douche
in there, so, uh,

23:43.880 --> 23:46.087
Irv, you and me, we'll go left,
Sam, you and Tracy go right.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.686
Okay. Let's move.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.609
Don't touch me.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.602
Whoa.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.887
What's the problem?

23:53.960 --> 23:56.566
My family's dead because of him.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.880
What?

23:57.960 --> 24:01.328
I watched a demon
slaughter my parents.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.691
And the whole time,
it talked about

24:02.720 --> 24:04.051
how it was celebrating.

24:04.120 --> 24:07.886
How some dumb kid
let Lucifer out of his cage.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.321
Okay, all right, we got to move.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.727
Girl's with me. Irv...

24:14.800 --> 24:16.848
Okay.
Let's go, son.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.610
There.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.729
Now that you've felt your feels,

24:28.800 --> 24:30.211
maybe we can talk.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.123
No.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.811
I'm gonna make
this simple, Kevin.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.086
Let me go...

24:38.200 --> 24:39.531
...and I'll give you
back your mother.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.925
She's dead.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.804
Oh, she wishes she was.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.609
After what I had
my heavies do to her,

24:44.680 --> 24:46.205
she's begging for it.

24:46.240 --> 24:50.723
But when have you ever known me
to let anyone off easy?

24:53.880 --> 24:57.646
You think Sam and Dean
care about her?

24:57.720 --> 24:58.881
Huh?

24:58.920 --> 25:00.490
You think they care about you?

25:02.600 --> 25:05.285
You're just here
to serve their needs.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.885
Nothing more.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.082
You're gonna lose, Kevin.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.640
Everything.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.929
It's just a matter of time.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.401
When the Winchesters
are done with you,

25:17.440 --> 25:19.920
they'll toss you aside
without a second thought.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.088
Because they can.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.884
Because they think
they're special.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.721
And because,
well, there's always

25:28.760 --> 25:31.206
another prophet
waiting in the wings.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.124
I'm the one in chains, but

25:37.200 --> 25:39.123
we're both prisoners here.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.328
What say,

25:43.400 --> 25:46.290
you let me go and we walk out
those doors together?

25:48.040 --> 25:50.964
What say we both win?

25:59.880 --> 26:02.486
Okay, I think
they're still inside.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.880
We'll wait till they come out,
we pick 'em off, one by one.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.484
Listen, for the record,
Sam's not the only guy

26:11.560 --> 26:12.846
who thought he was doing right,

26:12.920 --> 26:14.843
then watched it all go to crap.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.160
Okay,
that's just part of being...

26:16.200 --> 26:17.611
Being a hunter?

26:17.640 --> 26:19.369
Being human.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.680
Look, you want to be
pissed off at Sam,

26:20.720 --> 26:21.687
that's fine, I get it.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.131
But if you want to go
after somebody,

26:23.160 --> 26:25.686
you make sure
that they got black eyes.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.846
You got to know
who the real monsters are,

26:26.880 --> 26:27.927
in this world, kid.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.325
Sam, you copacetic?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.001
Yeah.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.485
Good.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.646
Now hand me that toothpick

26:43.680 --> 26:45.728
and you and Dean, Tracy,
you beat feet out of here.

26:45.800 --> 26:46.801
What?

26:46.840 --> 26:47.807
I'm going in there alone.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.285
I'll buy you
as much time as I can.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.044
Irv, that's death.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.202
Yeah, well,
it's what I got comin'.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.645
It's my fault, Sam.

27:00.320 --> 27:04.211
I was in some dive
and I was sloppy and lonely

27:04.280 --> 27:05.486
and I met some girl
and the next thing you know,

27:05.560 --> 27:07.528
I'm strapped to some bed
and she's twistin' things

27:07.560 --> 27:09.244
that ain't built to be twisted.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.243
She who?

27:11.320 --> 27:12.731
Abaddon.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.961
I gave 'em up.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.929
Pete, Tracy...

27:19.000 --> 27:21.241
I gave 'em all up.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.163
So, you hand me that blade
and you let me do

27:23.240 --> 27:24.526
what I got to do
or so help me...

27:40.040 --> 27:41.087
Boo.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.610
Nice grouping-

27:53.680 --> 27:55.170
Kevlar.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.765
Beats magic bullets.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.165
I love the future.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.880
Listen,

28:01.920 --> 28:02.967
my car is three blocks over.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.007
Go get more bullets,
more holy water...

28:04.080 --> 28:05.080
Get everything!

28:05.120 --> 28:06.042
No, no, but...
but what about you?

28:06.120 --> 28:07.121
Just go. Go, now!

28:16.160 --> 28:17.685
Alone at last.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.805
I missed you.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.046
Did you miss me?

28:35.440 --> 28:36.440
Ah!

28:46.520 --> 28:48.522
Cool.
I didn't miss the best part.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.930
I so appreciate you boys coming
when I call.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.288
I think that's what I like most
about you Winchesters.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.810
You're so obedient.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.491
And suicidally stupid.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.608
I like that, too.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.920
Are we gonna fight or make out,

29:06.960 --> 29:08.803
'cause I'm gettin' some
real mixed signals here.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.649
I want Crowley.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.806
Or what's left of him.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.081
Yeah, what's in it for me?

29:14.160 --> 29:15.241
I let you die.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.288
You give me Crowley's head
and I will snap your neck,

29:17.320 --> 29:18.287
quick and clean.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.890
You won't feel a thing,
trust me.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.325
And if I tell you to get bent?

29:21.360 --> 29:22.407
Oh.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.766
Well...

29:25.960 --> 29:28.042
You know, I've loved this body

29:28.160 --> 29:31.209
since the moment I first saw it.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.447
You're the perfect vessel, Dean.

29:33.520 --> 29:37.206
You give a girl
all sorts of nasty ideas.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.641
So go ahead
and play hard-to-get

29:39.680 --> 29:42.843
and I'll peel off this
no-demons-allowed tattoo

29:42.880 --> 29:44.644
and blow smoke up your ass.

29:45.640 --> 29:46.721
Ooh...

29:46.880 --> 29:48.325
Well, I got to tell you,
between you and me,

29:48.360 --> 29:50.840
it is a horror show up there.

29:50.880 --> 29:51.961
It can get worse.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.201
Trust me.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.083
'Cause once I'm on top,
I'll make you watch.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.204
And I'll use your body.

29:59.240 --> 30:00.730
Have you ever felt
an infant's blood

30:00.800 --> 30:02.325
drip down your chin?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.721
Or listened to a girl scream,
as you rip her guts out?

30:04.800 --> 30:07.406
Because you will.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.721
You and me, lover.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.245
We'll have a grand old time.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.720
And here I thought
all you Winchesters

30:17.800 --> 30:19.245
were supposed to be tough.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.646
An angel?

30:43.720 --> 30:44.881
What, do you think
we'd roll up to this mousetrap

30:44.920 --> 30:45.967
without some backup?

31:10.280 --> 31:11.770
They were going
to kill him, Dean.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.121
Ezekiel?

31:18.080 --> 31:19.286
The hell did you do?

31:22.480 --> 31:24.164
I was protecting your brother.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.129
I thought
that was what you wanted.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.081
Yeah.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.963
Right, yeah, no, uh...

31:31.000 --> 31:34.482
Sorry, I'm just still getting
used to this whole thing.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.607
As am I.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.442
But Sam's okay?

31:39.480 --> 31:42.006
He was knocked unconscious.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.520
In a way, he still is.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.683
Sam will not remember
any of this.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.961
So, what the hell
am I supposed to tell him

31:49.000 --> 31:50.206
when he comes to?

31:54.240 --> 31:55.651
That's why I used the knife.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.046
Right.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.481
Smart.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.365
You are troubled still.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.240
Yeah, it's just that...

32:10.120 --> 32:11.645
...this is on me.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.921
I was the one who talked Sam
out of boarding up Hell.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.681
Okay, so every demon deal,

32:18.720 --> 32:20.688
every...
Every kill that they make,

32:21.840 --> 32:24.207
I mean, you're looking
at the person who let it happen.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.605
You were protecting
your brother.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.169
I am in Sam's head.

32:29.200 --> 32:32.170
Everything he knows, I know.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.727
And I know that what you did,

32:35.760 --> 32:37.364
you did out of love.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.800
Yeah.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.571
Uh, look, Zeke.
I'm gonna call you Zeke.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.206
I'm not really with
the whole love and...

32:48.680 --> 32:49.680
...love.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.563
But it is why I said yes.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.007
Yeah, if that goes sideways,
that's on me, too.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.769
That is not going to happen.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.649
This is nuts.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.529
I mean, you're Sam,
but you're not Sam.

33:01.560 --> 33:02.527
And normally, he's the one

33:02.560 --> 33:04.005
I'm talking to about
all this stuff.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.408
I'm trusting you, Zeke.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.960
I just got to hope that
you're one of the good guys.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.081
I am.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.088
But I suppose that is
what a bad guy would say.

33:28.600 --> 33:33.128
Dean Winchester,
you are doing the right thing.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.930
Sam?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.166
Sammy!

33:50.240 --> 33:51.685
Hey. Whoa.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.603
Dean?

33:53.680 --> 33:55.091
What the hell happened?

33:55.120 --> 33:56.724
You took a shot to the head

33:56.800 --> 33:58.290
and I came in
and saved your ass.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.651
Like usual.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.648
You killed three demons?

34:01.680 --> 34:02.920
Alone?

34:02.960 --> 34:04.803
I took 'em by surprise.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.081
Got a little messy,
I got a little lucky.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.929
Oh, and, uh...

34:08.960 --> 34:11.167
I'm awesome, so, there's that.

34:11.239 --> 34:12.446
Jeez.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.481
Yeah.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.123
You are pretty damn awesome.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.284
Hey.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.321
You Okay?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.766
Yeah. You?

34:30.800 --> 34:33.201
More or less, yeah.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.360
Good.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.166
I got everything,
but guess I'm late to the party.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.645
Lucky you.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.411
Let's blow this
toxic waste dump.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.562
Burgers and Silkwood
showers on me.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.331
Kevin!

35:05.000 --> 35:06.331
Kevin?

35:27.240 --> 35:29.004
Who worked you over?

35:29.040 --> 35:32.408
Martin Hayward
and Brandon Favors.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.161
They did this to you?

35:37.200 --> 35:39.362
No, they're demons.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.847
You asked for names,
I'm giving you names.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.042
They're under-performers.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.003
Spike them,
you're doing me a favor.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.809
Wow, you break easy.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.211
Please.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.483
Your little plan
to have me stew in my own

35:53.560 --> 35:55.722
delicious juices,

35:55.760 --> 35:57.205
pathetic.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.483
You want intel,
I want things, too.

36:02.760 --> 36:06.128
Maybe we can come
to some kind of arrangement.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.407
Quid pro quo, gentlemen.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.805
So, these are what, then?

36:09.880 --> 36:10.961
Freebies?

36:11.040 --> 36:12.041
Not at all.

36:12.080 --> 36:15.721
You can consider them
fair trade for the enjoyment

36:15.760 --> 36:17.205
that Kevin gave me.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.607
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

36:19.640 --> 36:22.041
He's my new favorite toy.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.243
Wind him up, watch him go.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.129
You check the names,
I'll go find the kid.

36:51.680 --> 36:52.960
Where do you think you're going?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.084
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.121
Talk to me.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.009
You can't keep me
locked in here. I'm leaving.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.650
Like hell!

37:00.680 --> 37:02.808
Man, we told you not to talk
to Crowley, okay?

37:02.880 --> 37:03.802
He messes with your head!

37:03.880 --> 37:05.325
He said my mom's alive.

37:07.080 --> 37:10.368
Crowley said if I let him go,
he'd give her back to me.

37:10.440 --> 37:11.680
And you believed him.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.444
He's still in there, isn't he?

37:16.080 --> 37:17.366
Crowley's lying.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.726
And if he's not?

37:20.920 --> 37:25.847
Well, if she is alive,
then she's dead.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.645
In every way that matters,
she's dead, Kevin, I'm sorry.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.367
I know
you're dying to bolt, man.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.044
I get it.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.122
But out that door,

37:37.160 --> 37:38.161
it's demons.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.401
And it's angels.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.643
And they would all love
to get their hands on a prophet.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.160
So, even with Crowley here,

37:45.280 --> 37:47.044
this is still
the safest place for you.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.851
It just is.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.609
And we need you, man.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.165
'Cause I'm useful.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.725
Because you're family.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.650
After all the crap
we've been through,

38:00.680 --> 38:02.364
after all the good
that you've done...

38:04.880 --> 38:06.840
Man, if you don't think
that we would die for you,

38:08.480 --> 38:09.845
I don't know what to tell you.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.931
Because you, me, Sam and Cass.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.570
We are all we've got.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.921
But hey, if none of that
matters to you, then,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.206
I won't stop you.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.242
Kevin's passed out
in one of the back rooms.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.290
He's a tough kid.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.566
He'll bounce back.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.561
What's up with you?

38:45.640 --> 38:46.640
Nothing.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.043
It's just...

38:51.080 --> 38:54.243
What Tracy said about me.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.731
She wasn't wrong.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.689
Sam, listen to me.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.684
You have helped a hell
of a lot more people

39:03.760 --> 39:05.649
than you have hurt.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.165
So, all of that...

39:08.440 --> 39:10.488
That was then.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.050
Okay?

39:12.080 --> 39:13.127
Here's to now.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.726
So, you ready for it?

39:20.840 --> 39:22.365
Hm...

39:22.440 --> 39:23.965
Fallen angels?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.081
Abaddon?

39:25.120 --> 39:27.964
Cass losing his halo,
Crowley in our basement?

39:30.480 --> 39:32.084
Crap, we're livin'
in a friggin' sitcom.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.087
What about you?

39:35.120 --> 39:36.963
How's the, uh,
the engine runnin'?

39:39.240 --> 39:41.129
Honestly, um,

39:41.200 --> 39:44.807
I feel better than
I have in a long time.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.251
I mean,
I realize it's crazy out there

39:46.320 --> 39:48.368
and we have
trouble coming for us.

39:48.440 --> 39:52.525
But I look around and I...
I see friends and family.

39:52.600 --> 39:56.446
I am happy with my life,
for the first time in...

39:59.160 --> 40:00.160
...forever.

40:02.760 --> 40:03.966
I... I am.
I really am.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.206
I... I just... Things are...

40:07.240 --> 40:08.321
Things are good.
