Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:05.305 --> 00:07.173
{\an7}Everything that's
in front of you right now,
I'm going to pay it.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.409
{\an8}Even-- even-- Okay.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.409
{\an8}This one is past-due payment.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.211
{\an7}You came out here
to support me and I got you.

00:11.277 --> 00:12.612
{\an7}And I want you
to understand that

00:12.679 --> 00:14.848
{\an7}I'm not gonna fail you,
I'm not gonna fail my kids,

00:14.914 --> 00:16.181
{\an8}I'm not gonna fail me.

00:16.248 --> 00:17.751
{\an7}You went to Amber's house
and you lied

00:17.817 --> 00:19.319
{\an7}and told me you was
at your aunt's house.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.187
{\an7}There's nothing else for us
to talk about.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.823
{\an8}Touch my (bleep).
All right, for sure.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.823
{\an5}Get the (bleep) out!

00:23.890 --> 00:27.427
{\an8}You're mad because you've never
escalated to a media (bleep)--

00:23.890 --> 00:27.427
{\an5}Hazel! Hazel!

00:27.494 --> 00:29.329
{\an8}Or a high-end blog that people.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.329
{\an8}The problem--

00:29.396 --> 00:31.698
{\an8}Eat that, bitch.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.334
{\an8}(Teairra)
Princess texts me
to go to Vegas.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.803
{\an8}What I am gonna do is
send the text message to Ray

00:36.870 --> 00:38.405
{\an8}and (bleep) with his head.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.640
{\an8}You and Milan, you guys
are running around here

00:40.707 --> 00:42.208
{\an8}with all these
(bleep) hoes.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.077
{\an7}I used to be
your little arm piece.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.077
{\an5}Okay, we've fallen off.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.812
{\an8}Now who are you showing off?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.080
{\an8}I'm just saying,
you know we've fallen off.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.249
{\an8}Is she outside?

00:49.315 --> 00:52.519
{\an8}In order for you
to realize what you have,

00:52.585 --> 00:54.287
{\an8}you have to be
without me.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.588
{\an8}So you don't want to
be with me no more?

00:55.655 --> 00:57.690
{\an8}This (bleep) is foul, man.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.127

Thinking about all the chances
I've given Ray continuously,

01:55.315 --> 01:56.716
it's starting to
make me feel like

01:56.783 --> 01:58.852
he's just taking me
for granted.

01:58.918 --> 02:02.322
But once someone
keeps taking you for granted

02:02.388 --> 02:05.058
and takes advantage
of the chances

02:05.124 --> 02:08.961

Aside from bitch-ass Jason Lee
throwing a drink in my face,

02:57.243 --> 02:58.978
{\an8}I'd say life is
treating me pretty well.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.813
{\an8}I got a hot new place
in the Hills

03:00.880 --> 03:04.450
and my music career
is definitely on fire.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.953
{\an5}Here you go.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.953
Oh, thank you.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.188
{\an5}This view is everything.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.188
Thank you.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.491
{\an5}I'm so, like, happy, like...

03:09.255 --> 03:11.491
I know you are.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.693
I invited T.T. over
to the new crib,

03:13.760 --> 03:15.695
you know, I wanted to
stunt a little bit.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.097
And I also wanted to put her
up-to-date to all the new moves

03:18.164 --> 03:20.166
I'm finna make out here
in these streets.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.834
{\an1}And I'm excited 'cause
I'm about to go to Dubai,

03:21.901 --> 03:23.136
and I'm finna hit that way.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.404
{\an5}What? Bitch...

03:23.202 --> 03:24.404
Yes, honey.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.805
{\an1}I'm finna go--
I got a bookin' in Dubai.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.240
Oh, I always wanted to go
to Du-(bleep)-bai.

03:27.307 --> 03:29.008
{\an1}Yes, I got a booking
out in Dubai,

03:29.075 --> 03:30.944
{\an1}so I'm finna go out there
for the weekend

03:31.010 --> 03:32.912
{\an4}and go make this coins
or whatever.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.912
Yeah. Yeah.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.082
{\an5}But let me tell you something.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.082
What?

03:36.149 --> 03:38.718
{\an1}Miss Nikki Baby, she wanted me
to have, like, a little meeting,

03:38.785 --> 03:40.920
{\an1}so I link up with her
and she with--

03:40.987 --> 03:43.189
{\an1}Remember old boy,
Jason Lee?

03:43.256 --> 03:44.657
{\an1}Remember the big boy
we was on the canyon with?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.159
I know who you talking
about, yeah, yeah.

03:46.225 --> 03:47.360
{\an1}Oh, okay,
the little fake blogger?

03:47.427 --> 03:48.861
He just went straight for like,

03:48.928 --> 03:51.464
{\an1}"You wasn't a publicist,
you was never nothing, you--"

03:51.531 --> 03:53.099
{\an5}Shut the (bleep) up.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.099
"You was homeless."

03:53.166 --> 03:54.801
{\an1}And I'm just
sitting there, like,

03:54.867 --> 03:56.202
{\an1}why are you doing
a history, credit check,

03:56.269 --> 03:57.737
{\an1}but you got your facts
wrong, playboy?

03:57.804 --> 04:00.506
{\an5}Like, you don't know me.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.506
So where did you go from there?

04:00.573 --> 04:01.808
{\an1}It just heated,
and out of nowhere,

04:01.874 --> 04:03.943
{\an1}he done threw Ciroc
and pineapple all in my eyes.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.845
{\an5}Bitch, I'm sitting there like--

04:04.010 --> 04:05.845
{\an3}(laughing)

04:05.912 --> 04:08.381
{\an4}Like, what?
Like, I broke my nail, honey.
I was trying to grab, like--

04:08.448 --> 04:11.084
{\an4}Have you ever had alcohol
thrown in your eyes?

04:08.448 --> 04:11.084
No.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.452
No. It burns.

04:12.518 --> 04:13.886
Like, I couldn't
even open my eye.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.322
{\an1}And then by the time
I could see, he was gone.

04:16.389 --> 04:19.091
{\an5}He was like...

04:16.389 --> 04:19.091
(laughing continues)

04:19.158 --> 04:21.694
{\an8}I've come across Jason Lee
before, and I will say,

04:21.761 --> 04:25.264
{\an8}he has been known to be a little
low-key messy in the past,

04:25.331 --> 04:26.966
but throwing a drink
in a woman's face?

04:27.033 --> 04:28.601
That's just an all-time low.

04:28.668 --> 04:30.036
You just don't do that, honey.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.171
That is
absolutely nuts.

04:32.238 --> 04:34.874
{\an1}You know that girl karma...
she a bitch.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.744
{\an1}Speaking of karma, her name
is mother(bleep) Teairra Mari.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.612
{\an5}Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh...

04:37.810 --> 04:39.612
{\an3}(laughing)

04:39.679 --> 04:42.815
{\an1}Your girl Princess hit me up,
inviting me to Vegas.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.318
{\an4}Oh.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.318
Mm-hmm, for a little party.

04:45.385 --> 04:49.088
{\an4}Yes.

04:45.385 --> 04:49.088
And I sent the screenshot
of the message to Ray J.

04:49.155 --> 04:52.291
{\an5}'Cause I just felt
like he should know.

04:49.155 --> 04:52.291
{\an1}Ooh.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.861
Like, 'cause y'all
humiliated me last year.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.664
Now-- ha-ha-ha--

04:57.730 --> 04:59.198
Who has the last laugh?

04:59.265 --> 05:01.034
(Hazel-E)
T.T. really is messy.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.436
On top of that,
she is a fire sign

05:03.503 --> 05:05.938
and will torch this
whole (bleep) to flames,

05:06.005 --> 05:09.208
and thank God
it's not me.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.576
(laughs)

05:10.643 --> 05:12.078
So I sent it.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.746
I know he got it,
I know his ass saw it

05:13.813 --> 05:16.349
because then Princess
hits me back,

05:16.416 --> 05:19.585
{\an1}like, Ray wants me to hang out
with him and da-da-da,

05:19.652 --> 05:21.287
so I'm not gonna go.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.356
{\an1}I'm like, oh, okay, so he saw
it, 'cause he shut it down.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.058
Oh, the games
that we play.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.026
(chuckling)

05:27.093 --> 05:29.162
♪♪

05:32.198 --> 05:34.133
{\an8}Ooh!

05:34.200 --> 05:36.069
Oh.

05:36.135 --> 05:39.605
{\an5}(Nikki)
I haven't seen Brandi since she
busted in on Max in the studio.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.641
I gotta see how things shook
out between Brandi and her man.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.476
Oh, yes, flex.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.978
{\an8}And now that I got
all this mess between
Jason Lee throwing drinks

05:46.045 --> 05:47.947
{\an8}and Kamiah getting messy
with me and Fizz,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.883
{\an8}I got a lot to tell my girl
and maybe she can help me
out this time.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.986
{\an5}The last time I saw you
is when you made me act
like a Robocop with Max.

05:54.053 --> 05:57.724
{\an4}Yes, you were
a beautiful little decoy.

05:54.053 --> 05:57.724
Thank you, honey.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.792
{\an1}Girl, we've been trying
to get it together.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.162
You know, it's...
up and down, but--

06:03.229 --> 06:05.264
{\an1}I'm sure y'all will
work it out, you always do.

06:05.331 --> 06:08.735
{\an8}The truth is, things are not
great with me and Max.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.137
{\an8}We've been fighting
like cats and dogs.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.539
So I'm focusing on
my friends right now.

06:13.606 --> 06:15.942
{\an1}What is going on with you
and your love life?

06:16.008 --> 06:18.077
Well, you know,
I've been dating Fizz.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.712
{\an5}What?

06:18.144 --> 06:19.712
{\an3}Yes, girl.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.447
Everything been cool
between us, except,

06:21.514 --> 06:23.116
you know, we had
this little run-in

06:23.182 --> 06:24.884
with some girl
he used to (bleep) with.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.953
{\an1}She starts talking about
my plastic surgery to Fizz.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.489
{\an1}Bitch, sit down, go get
your ass some plastic surgery.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.990
Honey, she did,
she got some fake titties

06:31.057 --> 06:32.892
{\an5}and they came out lopsided.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.892
And she still look a hot mess.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.628
{\an1}Exactly. And it's, like, girl,
she starts talking about me

06:35.695 --> 06:37.330
to her friend named Jason.

06:37.396 --> 06:39.265
He's some messy
little blogger, you know.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.567
So I had this meeting
with him, you know,

06:41.634 --> 06:43.336
{\an5}I decided to bring
Hazel with me.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.336
{\an1}Right.

06:43.402 --> 06:46.172
I didn't even know that
he had an issue with her.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.108
And, girl, when I tell you this
man had a drink full, he just--

06:49.175 --> 06:52.078
{\an5}right in her face, and I was--

06:49.175 --> 06:52.078
That's so childish, though.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.913
{\an5}Oh, my God, girl.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.913
That's so childish.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.681
{\an5}First off, you are a man,
that's totally unfair,
it's uncalled for.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.617
{\an4}Stop acting like a bitch.
Period.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.617
{\an3}Period.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.652
{\an5}(Brandi)
Nikki is like
a little sister to me.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.221
No Boy Wonder,
messy-ass blogger,

07:02.288 --> 07:05.424
or a trifling-ass
clingy female Becky

07:05.491 --> 07:07.460
will ever come
for my people.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.629
End of story.

07:09.695 --> 07:12.098
{\an1}Anyway, I'm having this
little beauty bar tomorrow.

07:12.165 --> 07:15.168
{\an1}I'm hosting-- and nails, lashes,
you know, my type of thing.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.702
{\an4}Okay.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.702
And I want you to come.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.205
{\an4}Okay.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.205
And, you know, I actually
invited Jason's ass

07:19.272 --> 07:21.140
'cause I wanted
to speak to him.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.708
{\an5}Oh...

07:21.207 --> 07:22.708
I mean, you know what?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.443
I'm gonna show him, this is
the type of business I do.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.145
{\an5}Even though the petty B.S...

07:24.510 --> 07:26.145
{\an3}Yes.

07:26.212 --> 07:29.115
{\an4}...I'm still a boss and I--
Go ahead and come.

by Amber neither.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.946
I can't even focus on
fixing things with Milan

09:07.013 --> 09:09.248
until I set (bleep)
straight with Amber first.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.484
I know Amber has hopes that
we gonna get back together

09:11.550 --> 09:13.219
and revisit our past,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.821
but as hard
as it's gonna be,

09:15.888 --> 09:18.124
I just gotta tell her the truth
about me and Milan.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.860
{\an5}Amber and I have talked about
going to couples therapy
in the past,

09:20.927 --> 09:23.562
so if I'm gonna do this,
I need to do this the right way,

09:23.629 --> 09:25.498
so I reached out
to a therapist.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.833
(line ringing)

09:27.900 --> 09:29.502
(Amber)

09:29.568 --> 09:31.003
Yo, what's up?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.872
<i>What's up?</i>

09:32.939 --> 09:35.341
Hey, yo,
I found a therapist.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.777
{\an5}You think you could--

09:35.408 --> 09:37.777
<i>Oh, really?</i>

09:37.843 --> 09:40.012
Yeah, you think you could
meet me at counseling?

09:40.079 --> 09:42.248
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:42.315 --> 09:44.216
So we could talk about
some things.

<i>We're finally</i>
<i>gonna go to therapy?</i>

09:46.385 --> 09:48.254

Okay.
I'm gonna text you the address.

<i>All right,</i>
<i>let me know everything.</i>

09:54.961 --> 09:56.862

to you right now.

{\an5}<i>All right.</i>

09:56.929 --> 09:59.332
All right.

to open your eyes.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.040
{\an8}We've been talking
about counseling.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.543
{\an7}And honestly, Angel, I do
think that's the first step.

10:10.609 --> 10:13.312
{\an8}I've had feelings
towards the same sex.

10:13.379 --> 10:16.582
{\an7}You wanted to come here today,
you want Amber to come,

10:16.649 --> 10:19.719

to tell her all of this.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.719
{\an5}Yes.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.054
{\an7}And so can you imagine
what kind of a pill

Clearly what I said
to Miles at the restaurant

10:39.105 --> 10:41.273
{\an8}had a huge effect,
because next thing you know,

10:41.340 --> 10:44.610
{\an8}my phone was ringing and we had
an appointment for a therapist.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.245
{\an5}How's Zoey?

10:44.677 --> 10:46.245
{\an3}She's good.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.747
{\an5}You know, she's good.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.747

But... it's Miles.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.851
{\an5}(Amber)
My sister Angel
is so close to me

10:51.917 --> 10:54.887
that she grew up with Miles
as much as I have.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.555
She's been hearing
both sides of our fights

10:56.622 --> 10:57.990
for as long as
we've been together.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.926
So hopefully, she can help me
get my head straight

11:00.993 --> 11:03.729
{\an8}before I sit down with this
therapist and have this talk.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.331
{\an8}What are y'all gonna do?

11:05.398 --> 11:09.368
{\an8}Either y'all gonna work it out,
fix it, or grow up and move on.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.736
I love him,
you already know.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.371
{\an1}Like, this is not
no little walk in the park.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.740
This is not a little
six month little binge

11:14.807 --> 11:15.975
or a little prom date.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.676
He's not the father
of my child,

11:17.743 --> 11:19.211
but it damn near
feels like it.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.180
Like, every--
since Zoey's been born,

11:21.247 --> 11:24.450
{\an1}even with her dad being dead,
this man has been there for me.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.118
{\an4}Right.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.118
The whole family knows that.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.853
{\an5}And we love him for it, yeah.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.853
{\an3}Of course.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.990
So I know he loves me,
that's not the issue.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.925
{\an5}Well, what's the issue, girl?

11:31.057 --> 11:32.925
Okay, with this whole--

{\an5}No, it's not, but guess what?

11:35.628 --> 11:37.997
What about my heart
and what about me?

11:38.064 --> 11:39.865
{\an1}Listen,
we have our opinions,

11:45.137 --> 11:47.106
We basically
made each other, you know?

11:47.173 --> 11:49.108
Like, he made me
to his own Barbie doll,

11:49.175 --> 11:50.643
I made him
to my own Ken doll,

11:50.709 --> 11:52.511
and we just love it,
you know?

11:52.578 --> 11:54.246
{\an5}You know him, right?

11:52.578 --> 11:54.246
{\an3}Yes.

11:54.313 --> 11:56.282
{\an5}You know his patterns, right?

11:54.313 --> 11:56.282
{\an3}Yes.

{\an5}Don't be stupid.

to open your eyes, baby.

12:04.156 --> 12:05.758

about counseling.

{\an1}We've been talking about going
to handle our problems.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.965

think that's the first step.

Angel is right.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.536

Man, getting out my record deal

{\an5}"Hey, man, thanks for
dropping a quarter mil,
but gotta bounce."

14:33.973 --> 14:35.808

that situation?

14:33.973 --> 14:35.808
It's on you.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.711
{\an1}You need to go sit down and
have that meeting with Harry.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.646
And say, "Yo,
I need to get out."

14:40.713 --> 14:42.781

to do what I do,

14:42.848 --> 14:44.283
you have to be out
of that situation.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.919
{\an1}I can't do any-- I can't even
bring you over here.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.788
{\an5}Right, right.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.788
And that's-- that's
as real as it gets.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.559
{\an1}(Bleep), I got
some work to do here.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.394
It's on you.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.696
♪♪

14:59.832 --> 15:02.234
{\an8}(Nikki)
It's just another day
of being fabulous.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.236
You know how it is,
they asked Miss Nikki Baby

15:04.303 --> 15:06.272
to be the face
of this beauty bar party.

15:06.338 --> 15:07.940
{\an8}And since I'm always
looking for ways

15:08.007 --> 15:09.575
{\an8}to get my face
in print out there,

15:09.642 --> 15:11.310
{\an8}you know I'm gonna work it.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.779
{\an5}This is really nice, I mean...

15:11.377 --> 15:13.779
Everything I do is nice.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.215
Looks like you have
some company, honey.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.819
{\an5}(Jason Lee)
Nikki invited me to her event to
cover it for Hollywood Unlocked,

15:20.886 --> 15:23.656
{\an8}but really, I need to talk to
her about that Hazel drink thing

15:23.722 --> 15:25.257
{\an8}because that's not
how I roll.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.526
And I convinced my girl Kamiah
to come along with me

15:27.593 --> 15:29.628
because she's young
in this Hollywood game

15:29.695 --> 15:31.730
and she shouldn't be making
enemies right out the gate.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.432
So I wanted her and Nikki
to have a chance

15:33.499 --> 15:36.602
{\an5}to put this whole
Lil' Fizz thing to bed,
once and for small.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.071
{\an1}Oh, there's Nikki.
I'm gonna go over there...

15:39.138 --> 15:41.473
{\an8}It really took some convincing
from my friend Jason

15:41.540 --> 15:43.008
{\an8}to get me to go with him
to this event.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.444
{\an8}After feeling like I was
completely blindsided

15:45.511 --> 15:46.812
and disrespected by Nikki,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.414
I didn't know how things
were gonna turn out.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.350
But, you know,
Hollywood being this big,

15:51.417 --> 15:54.320
{\an5}it's inevitable that
Nikki and I are gonna run
into each other at some point,

15:54.386 --> 15:56.522
so I figured,
why not be the bigger person

15:56.588 --> 15:59.258
and put what we went through
in the past?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.959
{\an5}(Nikki) What's up, Jason?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.959
Hey, what's up?

16:01.026 --> 16:02.394
{\an5}What's up, bae?

16:01.026 --> 16:02.394
How are you? Jason.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.463
{\an4}Hello.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.463
Oh, okay.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.131
I've heard about you.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.800
{\an5}Have you?

16:06.198 --> 16:07.800
{\an1}Hello.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.101
{\an5}Oh, okay.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.101
{\an3}Hi, Nikki.

16:09.168 --> 16:10.469
I haven't seen you
in a while

16:10.536 --> 16:11.570
so I just wanted to
come over and talk to you.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.771
{\an5}How are you?

16:11.637 --> 16:12.771
I'm good, how are you?

16:12.838 --> 16:14.239
I'm good,
I'm good.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.475
{\an1}So, yeah, we haven't had
a chance to catch up since--

16:16.542 --> 16:17.843
{\an5}Since Hazel.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.843
Yeah.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.813
{\an5}(Brandi)
When I saw SpongeBob
on steroids

16:20.879 --> 16:22.715
{\an8}waltz his little ass
in the room,

16:22.781 --> 16:26.885
{\an8}I knew he was the type of clown
to throw a drink on a female.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.355
And I have zero tolerance

16:29.421 --> 16:31.290
for that kind of bull(bleep).

16:31.357 --> 16:34.793
{\an4}I think that was really, really,
really a sucker-ass move.

16:31.357 --> 16:34.793
But you weren't there.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.762
{\an4}It doesn't matter, you don't
throw a drink at a woman.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.762
You weren't--

16:36.829 --> 16:38.864
Listen, I'm not gonna talk
to your Chihuahua.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.533
{\an1}Chihuahua-- hold on,
wait, whoa, whoa, whoa...

16:41.600 --> 16:44.303
I know this little
fluffy marshmallow boy

16:44.370 --> 16:46.705
did not just call me
a Chihuahua.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.907
I'm gonna show you better
than I can tell you.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.243
I'm gonna wipe that
little stupid smirk

16:51.310 --> 16:53.245
off your little
silly-looking face.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.214
Let's have a conversation
and tone it down, honey.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.183
{\an5}You are at her event.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.183
{\an1}This is the same (bleep)
you did last time.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.451
Did what?
Did-- Last time, when?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.387
{\an5}Last time with the Hazel--

16:59.518 --> 17:01.387
What you mean?

17:01.453 --> 17:02.955
{\an5}That ambush that happened.

17:01.453 --> 17:02.955
Ambush who?

17:03.021 --> 17:05.991
At the same time, if you take
a business meeting with me,

17:06.058 --> 17:07.893
{\an1}then you shouldn't bring
somebody there to ambush me.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.529
What? I didn't say-- You-- you
started this (bleep) with Haze.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.498
I'm trying to have a--
You wanna--

17:12.564 --> 17:15.200
{\an5}You like water thrown on you?

17:12.564 --> 17:15.200
That's okay, I'm not
worried about that.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.602
{\an5}You like water thrown on you?

17:15.267 --> 17:16.602
That was unnecessary.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.569
{\an1}You walk up to me
and say my Chihuahua.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.874
{\an1}Listen, you can scream in here,
I'm gonna kill you online.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.108
Let's be mature about it.
Let's be adults.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.676
So I really thought that
me and Jason were coming here

17:25.743 --> 17:27.846
to make peace and be grown-ups
about the situation,

17:27.913 --> 17:31.750
but instead, Nikki and this
girl who I don't even know

17:31.817 --> 17:34.153
just started going off and
throwing drinks out of nowhere.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.322
{\an5}I didn't even get a chance
to talk to her face-to-face
about our situation.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.024
{\an5}(overlapping shouting)

17:37.389 --> 17:39.024
Can I have a conversation
with you?

17:39.091 --> 17:41.026
{\an1}You walked into my event,
that's what it is.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.628
I walked into your event
and said hi to you, Nikki,

17:42.694 --> 17:43.962
'cause I'm not
a bitter bitch, okay?

17:44.029 --> 17:45.564
{\an5}Girl, you walked in--

17:44.029 --> 17:45.564
I walked in and I said hi.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.099
{\an4}You threw something
at me the last time
when I made you a gift.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.400
That (bleep)
was childish.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.735
Honey, when I was your age,

17:49.802 --> 17:51.603
{\an1}I wasn't living the way
you were, baby girl.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.372
{\an1}Okay, if you want to (bleep)
and (bleep) your way to the top,

17:53.439 --> 17:54.840
do what you gotta do.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.743
Wait, wait, Fizz told me
she was an appetizer

17:57.810 --> 18:00.145
{\an1}and every girl he's (bleep)
with is an appetizer.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.314
{\an5}He wasn't talking about
Miss Nikki Baby, baby.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.314
That's what he said.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.683
{\an5}Can I say something?

18:02.381 --> 18:04.683
No, you can't say something.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.485
{\an5}You gonna get your hand
out my face.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.485
You-- Be quiet.

18:06.552 --> 18:07.986
{\an4}You gonna get your hand out
my face, we gonna start there.

18:06.552 --> 18:07.986
{\an1}Please do.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.055
{\an5}(Bleep).

18:08.053 --> 18:10.055
(Jason) This was just ugly.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.858
And clearly, Nikki is the same
as the company she keeps,

18:12.925 --> 18:14.760
but it's all good
'cause this is what I live for.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.628
I'm sure all my readers
are gonna love to hear

18:16.695 --> 18:18.397
about what went down.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.965
{\an5}Let me walk you out
because you a bitch.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.965
You don't have to walk me out.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.834
You my bitch.
She my bitch.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.670
{\an5}And you're tired.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.670
Bye!

18:24.736 --> 18:26.338
{\an5}Guess what?

18:24.736 --> 18:26.338
You're a joke!

18:26.405 --> 18:27.973
Everything about you
is fake.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.008
{\an3}From body,
everything.

18:30.075 --> 18:31.510
If your (bleep) could
tell stories, bitch,

18:31.577 --> 18:33.412
we would really
be having a conversation.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.880
{\an1}What you gonna talk about?
Tell me, Jason.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.148
{\an5}And we're not talking.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.148
{\an1}Jason!

18:36.215 --> 18:37.716
Can't even have
a conversation.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.084
Jason, I'm gonna give you some
stuff to say, all right, babe?

18:39.151 --> 18:40.819
{\an1}I'm gonna tell you what to say
on your blog, honey.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.087
{\an5}Let me say this
while he's walking.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.087
Oh, trust me, I got it.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.624
{\an5}Write your stories, honey.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.624
What was that?

18:45.691 --> 18:47.526
{\an8}So I'm going to
a day party.

18:47.593 --> 18:48.894
{\an8}I invited Teairra.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.929
{\an7}I want to pull her to the side
and let her know

18:50.996 --> 18:52.498
{\an8}that I know exactly
what's going on.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.500
{\an8}And that's gonna be hell.

18:54.566 --> 18:56.335
{\an7}Bitch, your word
don't mean (bleep) to me

18:56.401 --> 18:58.003
{\an8}because you proved to me...

18:56.401 --> 18:58.003
{\an8}And that's fine, that's fine.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.505
{\an7}...that, bitch,
you ain't a genuine bitch.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.206
{\an7}Yeah, and I'm glad
you think that's funny, bitch.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.608
{\an8}I think it's funny that--

19:09.014 --> 19:11.350
♪♪

19:18.824 --> 19:20.826
(Princess)
It's crazy to know

19:20.893 --> 19:23.795
that I'm actually done with
Ray and all his bull(bleep).

19:23.862 --> 19:25.731
{\an5}You look cute.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.731
{\an3}Thank you.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.866
{\an5}(Princess)
Now, the one thing
I can't get out of my head

19:27.933 --> 19:30.202
is how (bleep) it is
what Teairra did.

19:30.269 --> 19:33.205
This two-faced ho
lied to me in my face,

19:33.272 --> 19:36.341
pretended to be my friend,
while all the while

19:36.408 --> 19:38.010
was setting me up
this whole time.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.879
{\an8}And you know I gotta tell
my girls all about this.

19:40.946 --> 19:43.649
{\an8}So how was Miami?

19:43.715 --> 19:45.350
{\an6}Well...

19:43.715 --> 19:45.350
That face.

19:45.417 --> 19:49.388
I get to the set of
Ray's video shoot.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.291
And he end up bringing it
up to me that,

19:52.357 --> 19:54.526
you know, I invited
Teairra to Vegas.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.094
{\an1}So he found out
about Vegas?

19:56.161 --> 19:59.197
{\an1}She did exactly what
I thought she was gonna do.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.967
{\an5}So he got the text.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.967
So it got back to him.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.503
{\an8}He's coming at me with it,
you know, I don't trust you

20:04.570 --> 20:05.938
because you been
hanging out with Teairra,

20:06.004 --> 20:07.606
you invited her to Vegas.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.742
{\an1}In his head, he was already
done, so I was done with him.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.444
That was just the icing
on the cake.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.980
{\an5}I went to Miami
in a relationship
and I came back single.

20:15.047 --> 20:15.981
{\an5}What?

20:15.047 --> 20:15.981
(Shanda) Shut up.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.182
Are you serious?

20:17.249 --> 20:19.017
{\an5}You know, me and Ray are done.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.017
{\an1}Oh.

20:19.084 --> 20:22.454
{\an5}And any man who lets their woman
go to jail, you don't love them.

20:19.084 --> 20:22.454
Yeah.

20:22.521 --> 20:24.389
{\an5}(Nia)
I understand what Princess
is going through.

20:24.456 --> 20:26.525
I'm going through something
similar with Dre right now.

20:26.592 --> 20:27.960
{\an8}And I'm in a place where

20:28.026 --> 20:29.461
{\an8}we're gonna have
to get (bleep) right

20:29.528 --> 20:31.330
{\an8}or I'm gonna have to keep it
moving, just like my girl.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.266
{\an8}When I came back, I moved
my (bleep) out that house,

20:34.333 --> 20:36.468
I got me my own place,

20:36.535 --> 20:38.904
and this is
where I'm at now.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.273
And my problem right now
is with Teairra.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.609
{\an8}So I gotta admit,
I didn't want to believe

20:43.675 --> 20:46.378
{\an8}that Teairra would be going back
and telling Ray information

20:46.445 --> 20:47.579
{\an8}that Princess told her.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.214
I'm a little afraid
for these two

20:49.281 --> 20:51.650
to be having another problem
with one another

20:51.717 --> 20:53.685
because it can
get really ugly.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.687
What you-- what you gonna do?
What you think you gonna do?

20:55.754 --> 20:58.123
So I'm going to a day party.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.525
{\an1}I invited Teairra, you know,
a couple days ago,

21:00.592 --> 21:02.561
and she doesn't know
how I feel or--

21:02.628 --> 21:05.130
{\an1}she doesn't know that
I wanna say anything to her,

21:05.197 --> 21:07.366
but I want to just,
you know,

21:07.432 --> 21:09.534
pull her to the side
and just let her know

21:09.601 --> 21:11.570
{\an5}that I know exactly
what's going on.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.570
{\an1}Right.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.672
And I want you guys
to come with me.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.841
{\an1}(laughing)

21:15.907 --> 21:18.310
That's cool, but I just don't
want to be in no (bleep).

21:18.377 --> 21:20.445

25:11.276 --> 25:12.677
But in order to get it,

25:12.744 --> 25:14.813
he has to get out of
a contract that I know

25:14.880 --> 25:16.348
invested a lot of
money in him,

sounds great,

28:32.710 --> 28:35.447
{\an1}First of all, let Ray claim you,
then you can (bleep) with me.

28:35.513 --> 28:37.715
{\an5}Oh, really? It's fine.

28:35.513 --> 28:37.715
Because, you know what?

28:37.782 --> 28:39.717
{\an5}You're a (bleep)-up person.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.717
I'm a (bleep)-up person?

28:39.784 --> 28:40.752
You're a (bleep)-up person.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.120
You're unloyal
to everybody

28:42.187 --> 28:44.155
because you (bleep)
everybody's (bleep).

28:44.222 --> 28:46.024
{\an5}Oh, and what do you do?

28:44.222 --> 28:46.024
You had sex--

28:47.592 --> 28:49.928
{\an1}Bitch, I will (bleep) you up!
Don't (bleep) with me!

28:49.994 --> 28:52.330
{\an4}I'll--

28:49.994 --> 28:52.330
You're (bleep) nasty.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.998
Don't (bleep) with me.
You got me (bleep) up.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.434
{\an7}You want him to move me out
the house so you can move in.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.069
{\an8}I never said that.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.069
{\an8}Yeah, you did.

28:58.136 --> 29:00.305
{\an8}Wait, hold up. No, 'cause
that's some bull(bleep).

29:00.371 --> 29:01.906
{\an8}Yeah, you did,
yeah you did.

29:00.371 --> 29:01.906
{\an5}'Cause who told her--

29:01.973 --> 29:04.409
{\an7}Ray did.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.409
{\an8}Ray is a (bleep) liar!

29:13.418 --> 29:15.920
{\an1}Bitch, I will (bleep) you up!
Don't (bleep) with me!

29:15.987 --> 29:18.523
(Bleep), I'll block
every shot you got!

29:18.590 --> 29:20.658
You're (bleep) gross.
You're (bleep) nasty.

29:20.725 --> 29:22.127
{\an1}Bitch, don't (bleep) with me.
You got me (bleep) up.

29:22.193 --> 29:24.295
You (bleep) ratchet-ass ho.

29:24.362 --> 29:27.098
Teairra has been in
my business for way too long.

29:27.165 --> 29:30.001
She had no reason to
sit there and poke her nose

29:30.068 --> 29:32.871
in my relationship with Ray
and try to (bleep) it up.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.607
{\an5}Why did you do all this?

29:32.937 --> 29:35.607
Why did I do all of what?

29:35.673 --> 29:37.041
{\an1}What's the point of doing all
this? Like, you think for--

29:37.108 --> 29:38.610
{\an5}If you going behind my back--

29:37.108 --> 29:38.610
So what is your point?

29:38.676 --> 29:40.378
And going to tell him some
(bleep) that he's gonna

29:40.445 --> 29:41.679
{\an5}want to be with you?

29:40.445 --> 29:41.679
It wasn't about being your back.

29:41.746 --> 29:42.747
{\an5}I told you to your face.

29:41.746 --> 29:42.747
'Cause you know what?

29:42.814 --> 29:44.149
He's not gonna want you.

29:44.215 --> 29:45.617
That's fine, bitch.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.485
He does not want
your fat ass.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.088
{\an5}Bitch!

29:47.552 --> 29:50.088
Yeah. Fat ass!

29:50.155 --> 29:51.990
He don't want you.
You're sloppy.

29:52.056 --> 29:53.691
You (bleep)
all his friends.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.793
{\an5}Oh, I (bleep) all his friends?

29:53.758 --> 29:55.793
You a slut, you a slut.

29:55.860 --> 29:58.363
Y'all so emotional.
Y'all so--

29:58.429 --> 30:00.965
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold up.

30:01.032 --> 30:02.634
{\an8}Yes, I spit at Princess,

30:02.700 --> 30:04.802
{\an8}only because she tried
to come at me.

30:04.869 --> 30:07.572
This girl is just pissed
that she got played.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.340
But to be honest,

30:09.407 --> 30:11.543
this never should have got back
to her in the first place.

30:11.609 --> 30:13.344
But that's just Ray J.

30:13.411 --> 30:15.914
{\an1}Teairra, chill out.
Chill the (bleep) out.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.317
{\an5}(Apryl)
I'm always the peacemaker
and I try to be as neutral

30:19.384 --> 30:21.986
{\an8}as I possibly can be,
but I'm tired.

30:22.053 --> 30:24.589
{\an8}I'm tired of offering advice
and being sane

30:24.656 --> 30:27.292
{\an8}when I'm around crazy
mother(bleep) all the time.

30:27.358 --> 30:28.927
{\an8}Why did you tell Ray

30:28.993 --> 30:32.397
{\an8}that you want him to move me out
the house so you could move in?

30:32.463 --> 30:34.432
{\an5}I never said that in my life.

30:32.463 --> 30:34.432
Yeah, you did.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.301
{\an5}Wait, hold up.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.301
{\an1}You asked him to move me
out the house, yeah, you did.

30:36.367 --> 30:37.535
{\an1}Nah, 'cause that's some
bull(bleep) because who told her

30:37.602 --> 30:39.204
{\an5}that I would ever say (bleep)--

30:37.602 --> 30:39.204
{\an1}Ray did.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.406
{\an5}Ray is a (bleep) liar!

30:39.270 --> 30:41.406
(Bleep) you!

30:41.472 --> 30:43.841
That cheat on you and do
all this (bleep) to you!

30:43.908 --> 30:47.245
{\an5}Are you kidding me?

30:43.908 --> 30:47.245
{\an1}The same (bleep) that you
throwing me under the bus for?

30:47.312 --> 30:48.446
{\an1}Seriously?

30:48.513 --> 30:50.949
I never told him
anything like that.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.750
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, you did.

30:52.817 --> 30:54.385
I swear to God
on my grandmother's grave,

30:54.452 --> 30:56.087
{\an5}and I would never do that.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.087
{\an1}Yeah, you did, bitch.
Yes, you did.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.655
{\an4}So you need to listen to
what the (bleep) I'm saying.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.655
{\an1}No.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.757
Or then we don't even need
to have a conversation.

30:59.824 --> 31:01.826
{\an1}We don't need to have
a conversation because, bitch,

31:01.893 --> 31:04.529
{\an5}your word don't mean (bleep) to
me because you proved to me...

31:01.893 --> 31:04.529
That's fine, that's fine.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.097
{\an1}...that, bitch,
you ain't a genuine bitch.

31:06.164 --> 31:07.599
{\an1}And I'm glad you think
that's funny, bitch.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.934
'Cause I think
it's funny that--

31:10.001 --> 31:12.537
Bitch, I'll beat
your ass, ho.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.405
{\an1}You ain't gonna beat (bleep),
bitch, 'cause you a hippo.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.441
{\an5}Bitch, you can't move.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.441
I'm faster than you.

31:16.507 --> 31:19.410
{\an1}You an elephant. I'm gonna
get you now or later, bitch.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.713
{\an5}And you, too. Both of you.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.713
Her too, that's funny.

31:21.779 --> 31:22.714
{\an5}I wish you would.

31:21.779 --> 31:22.714
{\an1}Yeah.

31:22.780 --> 31:25.049
Both of you.

{\an5}(Willie)
I get that Shanda's
nervous about money.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.030
And I'm feeling the pressure
because I'm stuck in a situation

32:12.096 --> 32:14.332
{\an8}with this indie label and they
got me here in the slow lane.

32:14.399 --> 32:16.167
{\an5}What's going on, man?

32:14.399 --> 32:16.167
How you doing, man?

32:16.234 --> 32:18.269
{\an5}I'm glad to see you.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.269
Sounds good.

32:18.336 --> 32:19.771
{\an5}(Willie)
But Screwface is telling me
he might have

32:19.837 --> 32:21.306
a big deal
on the table for me

32:21.372 --> 32:22.540
if I can get out of
this contract.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.175
I gotta sit down
with the label owner Harry

32:24.242 --> 32:25.943
and try to hash
this thing out.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.546
{\an5}Everything good?

32:26.010 --> 32:28.546
Uh...

32:28.613 --> 32:29.881
it's going, you know.

32:29.947 --> 32:31.983
{\an1}I guess now,
I'm just really at,

32:32.050 --> 32:34.285
{\an1}you know, backed against the
wall because I need the album.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.954
{\an1}I really need to know that
it's going and it's not just me,

32:37.021 --> 32:39.257
{\an1}I got my family out here
with me as well.

32:39.324 --> 32:41.426
So it's like that pressure
is just-- it's killing me.

32:41.492 --> 32:43.928
{\an1}'Cause I know what I'm supposed
to be doing and so, like...

32:43.995 --> 32:45.463
Well, you know
we love the project.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.532
{\an1}Yeah, most definitely.
I mean, it's a great project.

32:47.598 --> 32:48.933
{\an5}Everything sounds great.

32:47.598 --> 32:48.933
{\an1}Thank you.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.502
{\an7}I think the best thing to do
is to come up with a plan,

32:51.569 --> 32:54.772
{\an8}a detailed plan,
a few different targets,

32:54.839 --> 32:56.708
give ourselves
a time frame.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.843
{\an1}My thing is like,
I don't want to leave here

32:58.910 --> 33:00.778
{\an1}and still have everything
in the clouds.

33:00.845 --> 33:02.547
{\an1}Like, okay, cool, we're gonna
come up with a date.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.248
I mean, how soon are we--

33:04.315 --> 33:08.219
{\an1}how soon can we get back in
touch and even find out, though?

33:08.286 --> 33:11.622
{\an1}Well, I think I'm gonna
have to talk with my partner.

33:11.689 --> 33:14.525
{\an5}(Willie) With Shanda sitting
at home counting down the days
until the money run out,

33:14.592 --> 33:17.095
{\an5}I don't have time to be
just sitting around waiting
for a plan to come together.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.896
If our partnership
ain't working out,

33:18.963 --> 33:20.498
then I gotta
find one that is.

33:20.565 --> 33:22.166
And that's just business.

33:22.233 --> 33:23.468
On the flip side,

33:23.534 --> 33:26.237
{\an1}I've been given interest
from other labels as well.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.706
Where they're interested
in picking up the project

33:28.773 --> 33:30.742
{\an1}and things like that,
so it's like, you know,

33:30.808 --> 33:33.177
{\an1}with that being-- I mean, I
guess the biggest thing for me

33:33.244 --> 33:36.114
{\an1}now is that we me
being signed to the label,

33:36.180 --> 33:39.150
{\an1}it's kind of keeping them from
wanting to jump in on a project.

33:39.217 --> 33:40.718
I understand.

33:40.785 --> 33:43.121
This is your career,
it's your life,

33:43.187 --> 33:46.357
but you can't
let the pressure

33:46.424 --> 33:48.760
of a family situation

33:48.826 --> 33:50.962
push you into
making a bad decision.

33:51.028 --> 33:52.130
But, I feel like
the time is now.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.065
{\an1}Those opportunities
might leave the table.

33:54.132 --> 33:55.333
{\an1}And then, I mean,
I'm just sitting here--

33:55.400 --> 33:57.135
How serious is
this opportunity?

33:57.201 --> 33:58.970
{\an5}How certain?

33:57.201 --> 33:58.970
It seems to be very serious.

33:59.036 --> 34:00.738
Why can't we just
do the deal with them?

34:00.805 --> 34:02.106
{\an1}Because they're
not doing a deal.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.541
{\an1}They want it to be
artist to label.

34:03.608 --> 34:04.876
{\an1}They don't want to
deal with anybody else.

34:04.942 --> 34:07.545
{\an1}They was very specific
on that.

34:07.612 --> 34:10.114
{\an1}So it's like,
you know...

34:10.181 --> 34:12.717
{\an1}is it possible
to give me a release?

34:12.784 --> 34:15.920
Well, I didn't really
expect that, Willie.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.054
That's a pretty
tough thing

34:18.121 --> 34:20.324
for you to hit us with
right now.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.960
{\an1}My clock is ticking.
I need it.

34:23.027 --> 34:26.664
{\an4}You know, that's--
that's something we're gonna
have to really think about.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.766
That's gonna be a hard
position to get to for us.

34:31.502 --> 34:33.670
{\an7}(woman)
All right, are you ready?

34:31.502 --> 34:33.670
{\an5}Um...

34:36.007 --> 34:38.509
{\an8}As ready as, I guess,
I'm gonna get.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.976
{\an8}Okay, and I'll help you.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.976
{\an9}Okay.

34:40.043 --> 34:42.146
{\an7}Okay.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.361
{\an8}(Miles)
The time has come
for me to face my truth.

34:57.428 --> 34:58.963
{\an8}I've been keeping
a secret from a woman

34:59.030 --> 35:01.499
who has done nothing for me
but love me my entire life.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.201
I can't keep hurting her
like this.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.536
{\an4}Go ahead and have a seat
on the couch.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.536
{\an3}Okay.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.138
(Miles)
I can't do this alone.

35:07.205 --> 35:09.073
It's too big of a secret
I've been keeping.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.775
So I reached out
to a therapist

35:10.842 --> 35:12.877
to help me tell Amber
the truth about everything.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.213
She deserves to know about
my relationship with Milan.

35:15.279 --> 35:18.950
{\an4}I want you to first start giving
me a little bit of backstory.

35:15.279 --> 35:18.950
{\an3}Okay.

35:19.016 --> 35:21.452
{\an1}Give me a little bit
of history of

35:21.519 --> 35:25.189
{\an8}what has led you up to
being right here today.

35:25.256 --> 35:27.391
{\an9}Well, um...

35:27.458 --> 35:30.628
{\an1}I was in a relationship with
my high school sweetheart.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.763
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.763
{\an3}And, um...

35:32.830 --> 35:34.732
I've had feelings, um...

35:36.567 --> 35:39.337
towards the same sex,
um, since I was younger.

35:39.403 --> 35:41.205
I've always just hid 'em
and subdued 'em.

35:41.272 --> 35:43.808
And I actually
acted on them.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.377
I met a guy and, um,

35:46.444 --> 35:48.613
yeah, just where
I'm at today, um,

35:48.679 --> 35:51.048
me and him are
actually together.

35:51.115 --> 35:53.217
Um, we're boyfriends.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.619
{\an1}Okay, so you've
been kind of

35:54.685 --> 35:56.654
{\an4}walking around
living a double life.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.654
{\an3}Yes.

35:56.721 --> 35:59.223
{\an4}And it hasn't just been her
you've been hiding it from,
right?

35:59.290 --> 36:01.025
No.
I've hid it from--

36:01.092 --> 36:03.027
Well, my family
doesn't know neither.

36:03.094 --> 36:06.764
{\an1}None of my friends know.
It's just-- just me and Milan.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.500
{\an1}That's who I'm with right now.
His name is Milan.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.168
And I know that
the main reason

36:11.235 --> 36:13.104
{\an1}that you wanted
to come here today

36:13.170 --> 36:16.274
{\an1}is because you want
Amber to come

36:16.340 --> 36:18.976
and you want to be able
to tell her all of this

36:19.043 --> 36:21.212
{\an1}in a safe place
where you have some support

36:21.279 --> 36:23.948
{\an5}and help and so does she.

36:21.279 --> 36:23.948
{\an3}Yes.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.450
{\an1}Okay, so tell me a little bit
about what you--

36:26.517 --> 36:28.786
{\an1}what you want to say to her
or what you--

36:28.853 --> 36:30.888
{\an1}what you have on your mind
to say to her.

36:30.955 --> 36:34.125
Um, well, she wants
to move forward

36:34.191 --> 36:36.294
with our relationship.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.430
Um, even though we were,
you know, having problems

36:39.497 --> 36:42.733
{\an1}and on break,
she's ready to move forward.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.835
And...

36:44.902 --> 36:48.906
{\an5}she realizes that I have
been pushing her away.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.906
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

36:48.973 --> 36:53.678
So I want to finally
let her know why.

36:53.744 --> 36:58.115
{\an1}You understand, I mean, look,
you're dealing with a lot of...

36:58.182 --> 37:00.785
{\an1}things to have to
worry about, right?

37:00.851 --> 37:03.788
{\an1}What she's now
dealing with is,

37:03.854 --> 37:05.556
{\an1}you're her high school
sweetheart,

37:05.623 --> 37:07.792
{\an1}you're obviously
the love of her life,

37:07.858 --> 37:09.393
{\an1}she wants to marry you,
right?

37:09.460 --> 37:10.928
And you're gonna tell her,

37:10.995 --> 37:13.297
{\an1}"I'm not gonna be with you
in that way.

37:13.364 --> 37:16.033
"I have not been
honest with you

37:16.100 --> 37:17.835
{\an1}even though you've been
my best friend."

37:17.902 --> 37:21.005
{\an1}And so can you imagine
what kind of a pill

37:21.072 --> 37:23.541
that's going to be
for her to swallow?

37:28.579 --> 37:30.715
Mm-hmm.

37:30.781 --> 37:33.551
It's gonna be
your best shot

37:33.618 --> 37:36.187
{\an1}at saving
something with her

37:36.253 --> 37:39.090
{\an1}if you own up
to your mistakes.

37:39.156 --> 37:41.325
{\an1}So do you want to,
like, practice with me?

37:41.392 --> 37:44.528
{\an1}What would you say your list
of mistakes were with her?

37:46.097 --> 37:49.667
Um... everything.

37:52.303 --> 37:54.739
Hit me with them.

37:54.805 --> 37:59.443
Lying to her...

37:59.510 --> 38:01.445
Um...

38:03.047 --> 38:05.616
I guess not treating her
like my best friend.

38:13.157 --> 38:15.893
{\an1}It's okay, it's good
you're doing this now.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.030
{\an1}It's hard to hurt somebody
you love that much.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.936
{\an1}What's making you
the most sad right now?

38:27.838 --> 38:29.607
Just because, like,

38:29.674 --> 38:33.144
it's really, really hard
for me to...

38:33.210 --> 38:35.212
And I don't want to, like,

38:35.279 --> 38:38.582
hurt her or anything
like that, so...

38:41.318 --> 38:44.055
{\an1}It's hard for me as well,
like, dealing with everything.

38:44.121 --> 38:47.058
It's just been--
it's been a lot.

38:47.124 --> 38:49.527
{\an4}Yeah, it's a big burden,
isn't it?

38:47.124 --> 38:49.527
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.399
{\an5}(Miles)
So many emotions is
running through my body.

38:55.466 --> 38:56.801
I don't even know
how to feel.

38:56.867 --> 38:58.636
A part of me wants to
get up and run out.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.504
But I know by hurting her

39:00.571 --> 39:03.641
and getting everything off my
chest and telling her my truth,

39:03.708 --> 39:05.843
I'm freeing her as well.

39:05.910 --> 39:08.512
{\an1}Today is going to be
hard day for you.

39:08.579 --> 39:11.082
{\an1}And it's gonna be
a hard day for her.

39:11.148 --> 39:12.516
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.418
But it's time.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.887
{\an1}It's-- it's what's fair
to Milan,

39:16.954 --> 39:19.490
{\an5}to Amber, and to you.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.490
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.095
All right, are you ready?

39:24.161 --> 39:25.863
(sighs)

39:25.930 --> 39:27.865
Um...

39:29.400 --> 39:31.535
as ready as, I guess,
I'm gonna get.

39:31.602 --> 39:33.237
{\an5}Okay, and I'll help you.

39:31.602 --> 39:33.237
{\an3}Okay.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.206
{\an1}Okay.

39:35.272 --> 39:37.341
(doorbell rings)

39:39.243 --> 39:42.346
{\an8}The road to acceptance
can be a tough one to travel.

39:42.413 --> 39:44.715
{\an8}If you or someone you know

39:44.782 --> 39:46.550
{\an8}is struggling with
who they are

39:46.617 --> 39:49.386
{\an8}or needs support to come out
to friends and family,

39:49.453 --> 39:51.155
{\an8}you're not alone.

{\an8}(Rich)
Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

40:02.600 --> 40:04.468
{\an8}You janky as (bleep).

40:02.600 --> 40:04.468
{\an8}You janky as (bleep).

40:04.535 --> 40:06.036
{\an8}You (bleep) as (bleep).

40:04.535 --> 40:06.036
{\an8}You're shady as (bleep).

40:06.103 --> 40:09.006
{\an8}Why you lying to yourself?

40:06.103 --> 40:09.006
{\an8}Why are you lying to yourself?

40:09.073 --> 40:11.842
{\an7}I feel like I should have been
well aware of everything

40:11.909 --> 40:14.311
{\an7}that was really going on
and I wasn't.

40:14.378 --> 40:16.313
{\an7}I said I'm sorry. What else
the (bleep) you want me to say?

40:16.380 --> 40:18.082
{\an7}Sorry's not fixing
anything, ever.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.784
{\an7}I can't do (bleep)
with a (bleep) sorry.

40:21.018 --> 40:22.620
{\an8}She invited me
to her little event.

40:22.686 --> 40:24.455
{\an8}And I'm gonna go and tell
that little girl,

40:24.522 --> 40:26.857
{\an7}"Go find another relationship
to (bleep) up."

40:26.924 --> 40:29.393
{\an8}Get out my face, honey.
Get out my face, baby.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.628
{\an8}No.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.628
{\an8}Okay.

40:30.694 --> 40:32.296
{\an8}Now we really 'bout
to have a problem.

40:34.532 --> 40:38.569
{\an7}I've had feelings of attraction
towards the same sex.

40:38.636 --> 40:41.038
{\an8}And I've been
in a relationship.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.140
{\an8}I wanna call my mom!

40:43.207 --> 40:46.343
{\an7}I wanna call my mom!
(sobbing)

40:46.410 --> 40:48.412
{\an8}(woman)
We have morals.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.447
{\an8}So what, you just
saying (bleep) God?

40:50.514 --> 40:52.049
{\an8}Is that what you're saying?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.552
{\an8}Telling you guys is the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.220
{\an7}I don't know why
I have these feelings.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.355
{\an8}I don't know,
I don't know.
