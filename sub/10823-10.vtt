WEBVTT

00:03.178 --> 00:04.617
Previously on Ravenswood.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.594
We're here to place you
under arrest, ma'am.

00:06.596 --> 00:08.829
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

00:14.736 --> 00:18.372
Please, let me help you.

00:18.374 --> 00:20.440
He seems to really care
about your mom, Olivia.

00:20.442 --> 00:23.310
Before your dad was mayor,
he was the city attorney.

00:23.312 --> 00:25.546
Springer's dad is in jail
because of him.

00:25.548 --> 00:29.383
You're not the publisher of this paper, Remy.
As of right now, you no longer work there.

00:29.385 --> 00:31.818
Why don't you make a res
at the Apple-Rose Grill.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.286
- Really?
- I promise.

00:33.288 --> 00:36.756
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

00:37.591 --> 00:39.692
[phone beeps]

00:41.262 --> 00:44.163
I broke up with Hanna...
because of you.

00:44.165 --> 00:46.900
What did you mean
about strange dealings?

00:46.902 --> 00:49.201
There's a small chapel
near the west entrance.

00:49.203 --> 00:50.670
Yeah, I know it.

00:50.672 --> 00:53.305
<i>OK, but why is he trying so</i>
<i>hard to keep everybody out?</i>

00:53.307 --> 00:54.407
Miranda, look.

00:54.409 --> 00:56.609
Look's like the writing
from Remy's drawings.

00:56.611 --> 00:58.511
Gabriel Abaddon?

00:58.513 --> 01:00.212
[all gasp]

01:00.214 --> 01:02.248
I don't care how you picked us,
we broke your damn pact.

01:02.250 --> 01:06.485
- You broke nothing!
- How did this happen?

01:06.487 --> 01:08.487
He's gonna be very unhappy.

01:08.489 --> 01:10.622
He was happy to take
your sister instead of me.

01:10.624 --> 01:12.391
Who is happy?!

01:12.393 --> 01:15.394
[grunts] [choking]

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.584 --> 01:40.685
Your coffee.

01:42.988 --> 01:47.358
So... you spoke to the boy?

01:47.360 --> 01:50.327
- Dillon? I spoke with him.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:50.329 --> 01:56.266
- He knows what he needs to do.
- He knows, but is he capable?

01:56.268 --> 02:00.404
He always seemed to lack
a certain fortitude.

02:00.406 --> 02:02.940
Sometimes, Carla,
we need to trust in forces

02:02.942 --> 02:07.144
greater than ourselves to
provide the needed incentive.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.485
[tools clanking]

02:14.487 --> 02:16.653
[grunts]

02:22.527 --> 02:24.894
I've got this covered.

02:24.896 --> 02:26.295
I know what I gotta do.

02:26.297 --> 02:28.331
OK, I don't know who's been
showing them what happened

02:28.333 --> 02:31.701
but I'll get them there
before they see anything else.

02:31.703 --> 02:33.637
[yells]

02:33.639 --> 02:39.442
[giggles] You make me laugh.

02:39.444 --> 02:41.677
This kid you're describing,
with the bloody tears.

02:41.679 --> 02:44.447
I followed him. He led me to
Collins and Dillon in that car.

02:44.449 --> 02:46.549
What do you mean, he led you?
Did he say anything?

02:46.551 --> 02:48.484
No, but I knew
I was supposed to follow him.

02:48.486 --> 02:51.354
The sense that something's
trying to get our attention.

02:51.356 --> 02:52.921
We all feel it, don't we?

02:52.923 --> 02:55.591
When Abaddon broke into my dream he
wanted to know who was helping us.

02:55.593 --> 02:58.527
I thought he meant Miranda,
now I'm not so sure.

02:58.529 --> 03:00.796
- We need to focus on Dillon.
- Before he hurts anybody else.

03:00.798 --> 03:04.133
The kid with the bloody eyes; he took
me to Dillon once, maybe he will again.

03:04.135 --> 03:08.103
So, we need to figure out who he is
and what's he's trying to tell us.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.105
Hello, Caleb.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.340
Hi, I'm Hanna.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.711
Hanna.

03:21.350 --> 03:27.556
Um... this is Remy,
Olivia and her brother Luke.

03:27.558 --> 03:29.290
[all] Hi.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.726
Where's Miranda?

03:38.233 --> 03:40.634
[cawing]

03:42.030 --> 03:47.051
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

03:51.246 --> 03:52.446
[door opens]

03:52.448 --> 03:55.382
[Luke] Rem, did you
find him in the archives?

03:55.384 --> 03:57.084
Not yet, I'll know him
when I see him.

03:58.119 --> 04:00.554
That was eight kinds of awkward.

04:00.556 --> 04:02.622
She's pretty,
the girl he left behind.

04:02.624 --> 04:06.126
Thing is, the girl you leave behind
isn't supposed to follow you.

04:06.128 --> 04:08.261
That invalidates the whole
"left behind" part.

04:08.263 --> 04:11.431
She really loves him,
you can tell by looking.

04:11.433 --> 04:13.900
Poor Miranda.

04:14.836 --> 04:16.603
Why poor Miranda?

04:16.605 --> 04:18.904
Don't be such a boy.

04:20.741 --> 04:24.611
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh is right.

04:24.613 --> 04:26.779
Luke, look.

04:28.249 --> 04:31.183
- Is that him?
- That's him.

04:41.494 --> 04:43.328
[car honks]

04:43.330 --> 04:45.731
[crickets chirping]

04:50.570 --> 04:52.271
[door closes]

04:52.273 --> 04:55.140
So, you're living above
a funeral parlor.

04:55.142 --> 04:56.708
Next to it.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.310
Close enough.

04:58.312 --> 05:00.345
Hanna, why didn't you call
and tell me you were coming?

05:00.347 --> 05:02.381
I like surprises.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.050
I need to talk to Miranda.

05:08.921 --> 05:12.991
I told you,
Miranda doesn't live here.

05:12.993 --> 05:16.627
Which brings me back
to my original question:

05:16.629 --> 05:18.596
Where is she?

05:20.132 --> 05:23.401
Look, Caleb, I mean this
with all the love in my heart,

05:23.403 --> 05:27.305
I will crack your skull with a hammer
if you tell me, "It's complicated."

05:29.007 --> 05:31.008
Just tell me where she is.

05:31.010 --> 05:35.680
I don't care,
I won't hurt her. Much.

05:36.581 --> 05:39.583
I think that maybe
you should sit down.

05:39.585 --> 05:42.286
Maybe I should stay on my feet.

05:46.490 --> 05:50.194
Miranda is dead.

05:50.196 --> 05:55.032
Among the dead, Ryan Atwater, age 17, who
was attending the dance with friends.

05:55.034 --> 05:58.601
He died with four other kids,
right after the Korean War.

05:58.603 --> 06:01.838
Luke... Atwater was separated
from his companions

06:01.840 --> 06:04.240
who feared the worst
for the teen who was blind.

06:04.242 --> 06:05.408
A blind ghost.

06:05.410 --> 06:07.009
Who can show you the past.

06:07.011 --> 06:08.678
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

06:09.913 --> 06:11.514
- Hey, Dad.
- [door closes]

06:11.516 --> 06:16.685
- Remy. Luke.
- Mr. Beaumont.

06:16.687 --> 06:18.321
Mom called.
She'll be back on Tuesday.

06:18.323 --> 06:20.156
- Good.
- Let me take that for you.

06:20.158 --> 06:22.859
I've got this.
Don't worry about it.

06:28.098 --> 06:30.266
He always used to leave
his briefcase downstairs.

06:30.268 --> 06:32.901
Now he doesn't trust me around anything
that has to do with the paper.

06:32.903 --> 06:34.936
He'll get over it.

06:35.772 --> 06:39.274
Maybe when
I graduate from college.

06:39.276 --> 06:44.446
So, Miranda was dead
when you came back to Rosewood

06:44.448 --> 06:46.648
and we broke up.

06:48.251 --> 06:49.851
Yes.

06:49.853 --> 06:52.354
So why did you say
she needed you?

06:54.523 --> 06:56.724
Tell her.

06:59.595 --> 07:03.431
Miranda is dead.
But she's not gone.

07:03.433 --> 07:05.966
She's still here.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.002
She has unfinished
business with her uncle.

07:08.004 --> 07:11.873
That's what I'm helping her
with. So she can move on.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.208
Do you know what it sounds like
you're telling me?

07:14.210 --> 07:18.379
Yes, I do know
what it sounds like.

07:18.381 --> 07:20.347
She thinks you're lying.

07:20.349 --> 07:22.349
I'm telling you the truth.

07:23.952 --> 07:26.086
[Miranda]
She thinks you're crazy.

07:26.088 --> 07:30.757
For a while I thought
I might be crazy, but I'm not.

07:30.759 --> 07:33.961
If you can see her,
show her to me.

07:41.335 --> 07:45.305
Caleb, show her to me
and I'll believe you.

07:45.307 --> 07:49.776
It's not a magic trick, Hanna.
I can't make her appear.

07:49.778 --> 07:52.612
You either see
her or you don't.

08:00.287 --> 08:04.523
Hanna, wait. Just stay
so we can talk about this.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.326
No. Look, I need some air,

08:06.328 --> 08:09.262
and it's a little crowded
in here right now.

08:11.698 --> 08:14.232
[door shuts]

08:35.951 --> 08:40.121
- Hanna?
- Mrs. Grunwald.

08:40.123 --> 08:45.559
Oh, Caleb didn't mention
you were coming for a visit.

08:45.561 --> 08:48.396
Um, Caleb didn't really know.

08:48.398 --> 08:50.531
I see.

08:50.533 --> 08:55.002
Who could I sue in this town for making
my boyfriend crazy as a bag of cats?

08:55.004 --> 08:57.304
This must have
to do with Miranda.

08:57.306 --> 09:01.409
We all were affected
by her death,

09:01.411 --> 09:05.446
but Caleb seems to
have felt it the most.

09:05.448 --> 09:07.715
He says he talks to her.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.719
That can be a great comfort.

09:12.721 --> 09:17.224
And she talks back to him.

09:17.226 --> 09:22.195
The veil is thinner here. You've
experienced that yourself.

09:22.197 --> 09:24.531
Yeah, loose floorboards
and bad wiring.

09:24.533 --> 09:27.600
[chuckles]

09:27.602 --> 09:29.368
What are you going to do?

09:29.370 --> 09:32.605
I'm going to finish this cup of
coffee and get back to Rosewood.

09:32.607 --> 09:36.042
Stay.
Just a little while longer.

09:36.044 --> 09:37.777
And what good would that do?

09:37.779 --> 09:39.913
What you have with Caleb,

09:39.915 --> 09:45.217
that's worth more than
one afternoon, isn't it?

09:47.854 --> 09:50.256
You know,
I never really thanked you.

09:50.258 --> 09:51.557
For what?

09:51.559 --> 09:56.728
For pulling Ali out of the
ground. You saved her life.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.664
Come back to the house.

09:58.666 --> 10:04.770
I know your last experience was challenging,
but it's different in the daylight.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.907
Think about it.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.711
[door opens]

10:12.713 --> 10:15.746
This is who I saw at The Vault.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.149
Only his eyes were... different.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.550
I sent the picture to Caleb.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.153
I thought it was Abby that showed
me the lab fire at school,

10:22.155 --> 10:24.122
but maybe it was Ryan.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.359
I think you have to be in the place where
the thing happened for Ryan to show you.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.427
That's why I had to go to the Carver
place to see them send the pact.

10:29.429 --> 10:34.532
You ever been someplace where something
historical happened and you get like a chill,

10:34.534 --> 10:37.635
just from being there? Like there
was an echo of what happened.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.238
Luke, maybe he can show us
what happened to Dad.

10:44.743 --> 10:47.011
[phone buzzes]

10:58.189 --> 10:59.589
Hey.

11:00.858 --> 11:02.859
Hey.

11:05.563 --> 11:07.564
I was looking for you.

11:07.566 --> 11:11.034
I was afraid that you left.

11:11.036 --> 11:14.470
I'm still thinking about it.

11:14.472 --> 11:19.475
I asked around. I know that you were
telling the truth about Miranda.

11:19.477 --> 11:21.011
At least about the accident.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.013
Did you think I was lying
to you about that?

11:24.015 --> 11:26.649
If you did,
at least I'd know how to feel.

11:26.651 --> 11:28.784
How do you feel?

11:31.055 --> 11:32.455
I came here to fight with her

11:32.457 --> 11:35.558
and then you told
me that she was dead and...

11:35.560 --> 11:37.893
I was so angry I didn't
wanna let it in, this...

11:37.895 --> 11:41.564
this terrible thing
that happened.

11:41.566 --> 11:46.869
Caleb, I liked her and I wanted
to help her and now she's dead.

11:49.806 --> 11:54.376
And you were...
you were in the car.

11:55.511 --> 11:57.446
You could have...

11:57.448 --> 11:59.181
Come here.

12:03.419 --> 12:05.220
[Remy] What about
the current mayor?

12:05.222 --> 12:06.754
[Olivia]
He doesn't use this office.

12:06.756 --> 12:09.591
[Luke] Nobody does. Liv, you
sure you want to go in there?

12:09.593 --> 12:12.026
No, I'm not.

12:16.699 --> 12:19.033
It's exactly like Dad left it.

12:34.616 --> 12:36.417
What now?

12:36.419 --> 12:40.887
Maybe it's like the séance.
We have to ask.

12:42.324 --> 12:44.057
[exhales] Ryan?

12:44.059 --> 12:46.960
Is there something
you want us to see?

12:55.770 --> 12:57.771
You have that look.

12:57.773 --> 12:59.039
What look?

12:59.041 --> 13:03.476
The I have to answer
that text look. Go ahead.

13:04.645 --> 13:06.812
I'll be right back.

13:27.668 --> 13:29.702
Hello.

13:29.704 --> 13:31.137
Hello.

13:34.807 --> 13:36.175
Are you alone?

13:36.177 --> 13:38.777
My friend's over there.

13:38.779 --> 13:41.146
My friend's over there.

13:45.618 --> 13:48.687
Would you like to meet her?

13:48.689 --> 13:50.655
Yeah.

13:50.657 --> 13:52.791
Yeah, I'd love
to meet your friend.

13:52.793 --> 13:54.793
Then, come on.

13:54.795 --> 13:59.130
No, you stay with Olivia and Remy,
I'll be there as soon as I can.

13:59.132 --> 14:01.332
I'm with Hanna right now.

14:02.568 --> 14:04.468
Hey, let me call you back.

14:31.596 --> 14:33.997
- Hanna.
- Hello.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.167
You left. I was worried.

14:37.169 --> 14:40.069
You guys know each other?

14:40.071 --> 14:42.038
It's a small town.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.374
Hey, can I get you
to come back with me.

14:44.376 --> 14:46.476
Yeah, In a minute,
Max wants me to meet her friend.

14:46.478 --> 14:50.580
I don't think that right
now's a good time for that.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.751
I've seen her before.

14:54.753 --> 14:56.085
You've seen her?

14:56.087 --> 14:59.088
Yes. In Ravenswood,
at a party in the cemetery.

14:59.090 --> 15:01.390
I saw her and her friend.

15:01.392 --> 15:04.127
OK, I need you to walk away with
me and do not look back.

15:04.129 --> 15:06.829
Caleb, she's just a little girl.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.534
OK, where the hell did she go?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.136
You don't want to know.

15:14.138 --> 15:16.338
Caleb, you're either lying
or you're crazy,

15:16.340 --> 15:18.707
but whatever it is,
don't treat me like an idiot.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.376
Understand?

15:45.644 --> 15:49.013
So, Miranda, here I am.

15:50.849 --> 15:55.152
You know, I would've come sooner
only I just found out.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.454
I put some flowers
on your grave,

15:57.456 --> 16:02.625
but I wasn't going to stand out
there talking to myself.

16:02.627 --> 16:07.897
People do that in old movies, talk
to gravestones in cemeteries.

16:09.633 --> 16:14.704
I always thought
it looked cheesy and...

16:14.706 --> 16:18.007
it feels just as
stupid doing it here.

16:20.010 --> 16:24.080
So, have you met
any famous dead people yet?

16:24.082 --> 16:30.352
Cleopatra? Marilyn Monroe?
Anyone like that?

16:30.354 --> 16:36.024
I'm sorry. You're dead. This isn't
funny, I shouldn't be making jokes.

16:36.026 --> 16:40.529
No, please, make jokes.
I miss jokes.

16:40.531 --> 16:44.600
You have to understand,
if I don't make jokes I'll cry

16:44.602 --> 16:47.836
because I don't
believe any of this.

16:47.838 --> 16:53.709
When you're dead you're dead,
so Caleb's delusional.

16:53.711 --> 16:58.313
Maybe he feels guilty
that he couldn't save you.

16:58.315 --> 17:02.250
I told him to take care of you
when this happened.

17:02.252 --> 17:05.786
[scoffs]
I'm sure he feels terrible.

17:05.788 --> 17:10.425
- It would make him crazy.
- No, don't say that.

17:10.426 --> 17:12.127
He's not crazy.

17:12.128 --> 17:14.395
God, what am I saying?
Caleb's not crazy.

17:14.396 --> 17:19.166
He made you a promise
and he's trying to keep it.

17:19.169 --> 17:23.270
He's a good boy
who keeps his word.

17:23.271 --> 17:25.740
You don't get that every day.

17:25.742 --> 17:29.243
When he came back to Rosewood...

17:29.245 --> 17:33.114
the things he was saying, I was
sure that he was in love with you.

17:34.916 --> 17:36.583
Really?

17:37.585 --> 17:39.085
What did he say?

17:39.087 --> 17:43.323
He was talking about
how you needed him

17:43.325 --> 17:48.128
and how he'd made promises.

17:51.999 --> 17:53.900
[exhales]

17:54.835 --> 17:56.670
I know how much he loves you.

17:56.672 --> 18:02.642
Don't ask me how. [chuckles]
I just do.

18:05.079 --> 18:09.182
But you need to leave
so he knows that you're safe.

18:12.286 --> 18:16.055
That's what he needs right now.

18:16.057 --> 18:21.894
I'll protect him
till he can come back to you.

18:23.297 --> 18:25.164
I promise.

18:27.100 --> 18:32.237
I know all about promises.
Caleb taught me.

18:45.318 --> 18:49.554
Thank you for the flowers.

19:00.433 --> 19:04.468
[Luke] I don't think
anything's gonna happen. Liv.

19:09.208 --> 19:11.109
It was a long shot.

19:21.319 --> 19:24.154
[Olivia] It's Ryan, he's here.

19:24.156 --> 19:30.193
I'm sorry, too, Chelle. I don't want every
conversation we have to end like this.

19:30.195 --> 19:33.897
Just put something on a plate
and leave it in the oven for me.

19:33.899 --> 19:37.500
I'll be home as soon as I can.

19:38.269 --> 19:40.637
Rochelle.

19:40.639 --> 19:43.406
I love you.

19:43.408 --> 19:45.108
[hangs up phone]

19:45.110 --> 19:46.709
Dad?

19:55.018 --> 19:57.654
[Remy] He did know
about that pact.

20:01.858 --> 20:03.893
[Dillon] Mr. Matheson?

20:04.995 --> 20:07.930
Dillon. What are you doing here?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.634
I'm sorry it had to
work out this way.

20:12.636 --> 20:15.204
How did you get in here?

20:19.442 --> 20:21.143
Luke, do something!

20:21.145 --> 20:22.311
I don't wanna die.

20:22.313 --> 20:25.079
- [screams]
- No! No!

20:26.215 --> 20:28.583
[crying]

20:39.329 --> 20:41.529
Mom's coat.

20:44.566 --> 20:48.469
- Let go. Let go of me!
- Shh. There's nothing we can do.

20:48.471 --> 20:51.272
There's nothing we can do.
Shh.

21:30.177 --> 21:34.213
Dillon's thumbprint.
In your father's blood.

21:39.103 --> 21:42.219
[slow-tempo music plays]

21:47.209 --> 21:49.044
He's talking to the cops now.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.612
Telling them what?

21:50.614 --> 21:52.047
To search the office again.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.516
They don't need a warrant,
there's a crime scene.

21:54.518 --> 21:56.918
If they balk, your mom's lawyer
can lean on them.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.921
They'll find the book.
They can't miss it.

21:59.923 --> 22:03.891
We called, where were you?

22:05.727 --> 22:09.464
Keeping Hanna from walking away
with Max the moppet from hell.

22:09.466 --> 22:13.868
- You're kidding.
- In broad daylight.

22:13.870 --> 22:17.104
You need to get
Hanna away from here.

22:17.106 --> 22:18.505
I'm trying.

22:18.507 --> 22:20.808
Don't tell her about Miranda.

22:20.810 --> 22:22.677
Too late.

22:22.679 --> 22:25.880
What's the name of the new
lawyer? I'm gotta call him.

22:25.882 --> 22:28.582
I don't want the police
to find Dillon.

22:28.584 --> 22:29.883
What?

22:29.885 --> 22:34.521
I want to find him,
and I want to kill him.

22:37.758 --> 22:39.126
No, you don't.

22:39.128 --> 22:43.129
I do. So do you.

22:43.131 --> 22:47.333
That's not what's gonna happen.
It's not what Dad would want.

22:54.103 --> 22:57.438
Can you stay with them?
I want to find my dad.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.173
What are you going to tell him?

22:59.175 --> 23:02.009
That the police have new evidence
in the murder of Mayor Matheson.

23:02.011 --> 23:05.613
He's a reporter, give him news
and all is forgiven.

23:05.615 --> 23:07.014
You can just call him.

23:07.016 --> 23:11.018
Some things you text,
some things you tell.

23:15.156 --> 23:16.423
[shower running]

23:16.425 --> 23:18.725
It was just a real
spur of the moment thing, Em.

23:18.727 --> 23:22.696
My brain was melting,
I had to get out of Rosewood.

23:24.365 --> 23:29.369
Caleb's fine. It's complicated.

23:29.371 --> 23:33.873
Hey, tell Spencer where I am,
but not right away.

23:33.875 --> 23:37.510
All right, well,
I'll probably be home tomorrow.

23:37.512 --> 23:40.179
OK. Bye.

23:43.484 --> 23:46.085
[Remy] Dad?

23:46.087 --> 23:48.721
[footsteps on stairs]

24:16.516 --> 24:19.985
[clattering]

24:19.987 --> 24:22.387
[dog barking]

24:53.451 --> 24:56.387
- [gasps]
- Time to go. We've got a date.

24:56.389 --> 24:57.788
You're finished, Dillon.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.323
You're the ones
who are finished.

24:59.325 --> 25:00.391
What are you going to do to me?

25:00.393 --> 25:02.293
The same thing
you did to the mayor?

25:02.295 --> 25:04.194
[grunts]

25:04.196 --> 25:05.862
[screams]

25:05.864 --> 25:07.597
[straining]

25:20.377 --> 25:22.779
[door opens]

25:33.157 --> 25:35.191
[curtain ruffles]

25:40.497 --> 25:42.998
[curtain ruffles] [rattling]

25:56.312 --> 25:59.281
[gasps]
God, somebody's in here.

25:59.283 --> 26:00.815
Hanna, are you taking a bath?

26:00.817 --> 26:03.118
No, I'm baking a cake.
What do you think I'm doing?

26:03.120 --> 26:06.054
Listen, it's really important
you get out of that tub.

26:06.056 --> 26:10.892
- Well, I'm relaxing.
- Hanna, you can relax somewhere else.

26:10.894 --> 26:14.529
Hanna, please.
We have to talk. Please.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.866
[scoffs] Fine.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.601
[phone buzzes]

26:24.840 --> 26:26.674
I'll be right back, Hanna.

26:38.887 --> 26:41.788
Remy Beaumont is missing.
What do you know about it?

26:41.790 --> 26:43.491
What makes you think
I'd know anything?

26:43.493 --> 26:48.161
Because there's a very straight line
from Dillon to Springer to you.

26:48.163 --> 26:50.764
You think Dillon took
the Beaumont girl?

26:50.766 --> 26:52.766
I don't have time for this.

26:52.768 --> 26:56.003
You know exactly what's going
on, you've always known.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.005
There was a Collins when
the deal was made.

26:58.007 --> 27:01.675
There's always been a Collins,
taking orders, snipping hair,

27:01.677 --> 27:04.010
keeping those souls
in escrow for somebody.

27:04.012 --> 27:07.647
My family has kept this town
safe for a hundred years.

27:07.649 --> 27:09.582
By killing kids every time
somebody goes to war?

27:09.584 --> 27:12.885
No Collins
has ever harmed a soul.

27:12.887 --> 27:16.389
No, you only keep them
in a jar for somebody.

27:16.391 --> 27:19.124
You can't possibly understand.

27:19.126 --> 27:20.392
The mayor figured it out.

27:20.394 --> 27:22.562
That's why you sent Dillon
in there to kill him.

27:24.197 --> 27:26.131
Dillon did what?

27:26.133 --> 27:27.900
Stabbed the mayor.

27:29.603 --> 27:32.605
Dillon had the knife
all this time?

27:34.407 --> 27:36.708
You didn't know.

27:36.710 --> 27:40.079
No, I don't need you
to tell me to calm down...

27:40.081 --> 27:42.414
Dillon did this.

27:42.416 --> 27:44.149
Why go after Remy first?

27:44.151 --> 27:46.285
She's the one who had
face time with the preacher.

27:46.287 --> 27:49.288
And it's a way
to get back at me.

27:49.290 --> 27:51.123
You stay here,
I'm going after him.

27:51.125 --> 27:52.356
Like hell I'm staying here.

27:52.358 --> 27:53.925
Olivia, don't give me a hard
time right now, all right.

27:53.927 --> 27:56.394
- [phone beeps]
- Wait, it might be from Caleb.

27:58.363 --> 28:00.765
Liv, what?

28:00.767 --> 28:04.002
It's from Remy's phone.

28:04.004 --> 28:06.605
The Collins men
have always been undertakers.

28:06.607 --> 28:11.909
That's why we've always been the ones
to keep the Children of the Pact.

28:11.911 --> 28:15.713
Hold their essence,
in those jars,

28:15.715 --> 28:18.382
till the contract was complete.

28:18.384 --> 28:19.883
You could've changed this.

28:19.885 --> 28:22.353
My sister thought she could
change it and she's dead.

28:22.355 --> 28:28.025
Charlie Matheson thought he could end
the curse and got a knife in his chest.

28:28.027 --> 28:31.528
Whoever questions this
gets the same answer:

28:33.264 --> 28:34.999
Death.

28:36.501 --> 28:37.601
You did try to change it.

28:37.603 --> 28:40.070
You sent Miranda away
and when she came back

28:40.072 --> 28:41.138
you tried to scare her off.

28:41.140 --> 28:43.507
You have no idea
what that was like.

28:43.509 --> 28:45.008
My sister's child.

28:45.010 --> 28:49.112
The last living connection
I had in this world

28:49.114 --> 28:53.216
and I slammed the door
in her face.

28:53.218 --> 28:55.152
And then she was gone.

28:57.555 --> 28:59.122
[inhales]

29:04.427 --> 29:09.632
These things were done
before we arrived on the scene.

29:09.634 --> 29:13.269
They are beyond our
ability to influence.

29:13.271 --> 29:15.103
Caleb.

29:16.173 --> 29:18.440
Leave him alone.

29:50.479 --> 29:52.257
*** found the names.

29:52.259 --> 29:53.792
Remy took it.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.627
It's from her phone, but we
don't know if she sent it.

29:55.629 --> 29:57.395
We know that's where she is.
What are we waiting for?

29:57.397 --> 29:59.264
It could be a trap.

29:59.266 --> 30:00.465
Nothing can happen to me,

30:00.467 --> 30:02.200
but you guys still
have something to lose.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.001
Dillon's got Remy,

30:04.003 --> 30:07.004
I'm not passing up
a chance to break his neck.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.973
We can handle him.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.577
If it's just Dillon.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.961
[Olivia] Her phone.

30:35.066 --> 30:38.068
[door locks]

30:38.070 --> 30:39.403
Luke!

30:39.405 --> 30:41.505
Don't break his jaw till he
tells us where Remy is.

30:41.507 --> 30:45.342
Where's Remy? Huh?
Tell me. Tell me!

30:45.344 --> 30:47.176
- [groaning]
- Remy!

30:47.178 --> 30:48.678
[Remy] Olivia?

30:50.214 --> 30:52.882
[panting]

30:52.884 --> 30:54.050
We got her.

30:54.052 --> 30:57.386
- Let's get out of here.
- I don't think so.

30:57.388 --> 31:01.024
[electricity crackling]

31:15.839 --> 31:20.342
Well done,
my good and faithful servant.

31:28.584 --> 31:29.852
It's Abaddon.

31:29.854 --> 31:33.255
I told you
the debt would be repaid.

31:33.257 --> 31:35.190
But we're one short.

31:35.192 --> 31:39.194
No... we're not.

31:39.196 --> 31:43.031
My bad penny.
Come, stand next to Caleb,

31:43.033 --> 31:46.568
let me see
the lovely couple re-united.

31:52.241 --> 31:56.610
I know what you want.
And I can give it to you.

31:56.612 --> 31:59.714
She wants her life back.
Can you give her that?

31:59.716 --> 32:01.916
I have the authority.

32:01.918 --> 32:06.087
Death for you, Miranda,
it need not be permanent.

32:06.089 --> 32:08.622
We know that every deal you
broker comes with a price.

32:08.624 --> 32:13.627
You misunderstand me.
I'm not here to bargain.

32:13.629 --> 32:17.531
[chanting in a foreign language]

32:20.134 --> 32:21.368
What is that?

32:21.370 --> 32:24.438
It's the language
they used to make the pact.

32:27.374 --> 32:30.276
[gasps] [coughing]

32:30.278 --> 32:31.444
Miranda?!

32:31.446 --> 32:33.013
No!

32:33.015 --> 32:35.148
[grunting]

32:35.150 --> 32:37.017
[screams]

32:37.019 --> 32:39.720
[chanting continues]

32:41.055 --> 32:44.390
I can feel her. She's ice cold
but I can feel her.

32:45.892 --> 32:49.429
Whatever he's doing,
it's bringing her back to us.

32:54.901 --> 32:57.737
[panting]

33:07.347 --> 33:09.048
Shut up!

33:10.951 --> 33:13.919
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

33:13.921 --> 33:16.955
That's why I'm going
to help you get away.

33:16.957 --> 33:22.093
I like you, Dillon.
You bought me ice cream.

33:23.229 --> 33:25.029
Come on.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.628
[grunts]

33:59.364 --> 34:01.332
[groans]

[chanting in foreign language]

34:37.027 --> 34:38.092
Abaddon?

34:38.094 --> 34:42.763
You are not needed
nor welcome here!

34:46.168 --> 34:47.802
I won't let you do this to her.

34:47.804 --> 34:51.271
You shopkeeper. You clerk.
You janitor of souls.

34:51.273 --> 34:53.440
You do not have a say in this.

34:53.442 --> 34:55.509
Leave her alone!
He's helping her.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.945
He needs her alive
to take the rest of you.

35:01.782 --> 35:04.184
For a minute I was me again.

35:04.186 --> 35:08.722
He was bringing her back because
you all need to die together.

35:08.724 --> 35:10.324
That's the payment due.

35:10.326 --> 35:12.826
And I've come to collect.

[grunts]

35:14.196 --> 35:19.899
[chants in foreign language]

35:22.236 --> 35:25.004
- Get out of here!
- No, there has to be something we can do.

35:25.006 --> 35:27.006
- There isn't.
- We not giving up that easy.

35:27.008 --> 35:28.174
Neither am I.

35:28.176 --> 35:31.211
You were wrong, Abaddon.
I do have a say in this.

35:31.213 --> 35:34.179
I'm willing to let this one go.

35:39.986 --> 35:42.321
Then you know what
I'll have to do.

35:42.323 --> 35:44.624
I'm not scared of you anymore.

35:44.626 --> 35:46.825
Because I understand why
you brought them here.

35:46.827 --> 35:52.664
You're too weak to kill them without
the evil you feed from in this chapel.

35:52.666 --> 35:55.200
What I've hoped for all
these years is true.

35:55.202 --> 36:00.839
The two of them, together,
are more powerful than you are.

36:09.848 --> 36:11.616
[all gasp]

36:19.358 --> 36:21.426
Do you guys smell that?

36:21.428 --> 36:23.527
Roses.

36:28.167 --> 36:32.069
I'm sorry. I thought
I was protecting you all.

36:32.071 --> 36:36.740
She can come back.
But not this way.

36:36.742 --> 36:40.811
Who was that?
Who did you set free?

36:48.286 --> 36:50.153
Caleb Rivers.

37:06.637 --> 37:09.206
Can I ask you something?

37:09.208 --> 37:10.373
Sure.

37:10.375 --> 37:12.775
Do you believe me?

37:16.213 --> 37:18.914
I don't know what I believe.

37:18.916 --> 37:21.584
I know what
the smart thing would be.

37:21.586 --> 37:26.956
But I don't think that the smart thing
will make me as happy as you do.

37:30.593 --> 37:32.962
What are you going
to tell the others?

37:32.964 --> 37:35.497
Nothing.

37:35.499 --> 37:38.133
We know how to keep secrets.

37:42.072 --> 37:45.640
There's nobody like you
in the entire world.

37:47.209 --> 37:49.411
That's true.

38:04.159 --> 38:06.627
Keep that in a safe place.

38:07.596 --> 38:09.697
Don't lose it.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.501
I won't.
