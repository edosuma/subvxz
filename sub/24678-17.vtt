00:01.000 --> 00:03.641
In New York City war on crime,

00:03.670 --> 00:06.310
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.340 --> 00:08.820
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.015
These are their stories.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.823
Make sure you give me one
in the back where it's quiet.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.829
I'm going...

00:17.851 --> 00:20.024
To sleep in. Heh, heh.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

01:12.172 --> 01:14.345
Woman: The burgers are great,
you don't have to worry

01:14.374 --> 01:16.650
about a bunch of guys slobbering over you.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.816
It is pure luck I walked in here.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.916
I just hope I don't get lost tomorrow.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.121
You've never been to their offices?

01:23.150 --> 01:27.121
I was recruited at a job fair in Dayton.
What's the address?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.862
That's not far.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.931
I can show you.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.437
Okay.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.540
I just need to make a quick stop at my motel.

01:47.874 --> 01:50.684
I go by that building every morning
on my way to the school.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.782
You go to school?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.918
I'm a teacher.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.859
Sixth grade.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.261
I know, I shouldn't be grading papers

01:59.286 --> 02:01.288
while drinking beer.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.392
You know what, Allison?

02:03.423 --> 02:05.960
I think I'm just going to go
to sleep and get up early.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.269
Thanks anyway.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.642
(loud music plays)

02:12.666 --> 02:15.875
People told me it would be
hard meeting people in New York.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.973
What do they know?

02:18.005 --> 02:20.485
My God, look at your nails.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.317
I love French nails. I did them myself.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.823
Really? Mine are such a mess.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.188
I could fix them for you.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.321
I got everything at the motel.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.030
Waitress?

02:44.698 --> 02:46.678
Waitress: That'll be $12.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.976
My treat.

02:53.373 --> 02:57.287
Damn it, I must have spilled something.
I need soda water.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.722
We can take care of it at the motel.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.463
My son.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.866
He's with his daddy tonight.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.998
Let's go.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.235
I always lose with guys.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.439
I just have this talent for picking jerks.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.539
Finished.

03:23.570 --> 03:28.610
Beautiful. Can you do my toes?

03:36.683 --> 03:40.654
Think I have pretty toes? Mm-hmm.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.963
Kiss them.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.701
Come here.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.378
Let me just go to the bathroom a second.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.085
Hey, this stuff dries fast.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.470
( door bangs )

04:28.502 --> 04:31.779
( screams )

04:31.805 --> 04:36.151
( theme music playing )

05:20.921 --> 05:23.128
The guy checked in around 5:00 p.m. yesterday.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.137
Paid cash for one night.
Asked for "a quiet room in the back."

05:26.159 --> 05:28.639
Signed in as "John Smith."

05:28.662 --> 05:32.166
There was 30 bucks in cash,

05:32.199 --> 05:34.406
some change inside that. No ID.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.040
This how you found it,
with the photo facing up?

05:37.070 --> 05:39.550
Yep.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.712
Just so we'd see it.

05:41.741 --> 05:45.712
We're getting tapes from the
security camera in the front office.

05:45.745 --> 05:50.091
This T-shirt-- "Arista Day Camp."

05:51.918 --> 05:53.989
( clicks )

05:57.691 --> 06:01.036
( sniffs )
It's ketchup.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.599
Looks like somebody used it to wipe a stain.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.537
( blade clicks )

06:13.273 --> 06:15.617
The buckle's in the right place.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.259
Size 34.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.533
The way she's cut up-- like the other five

06:32.559 --> 06:36.029
in the city last year, right?
The "Motel Ripper"?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.268
It could be.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.472
Detective: That's why we called Major Case.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.242
We thought that guy was locked up.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.274
So did we.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.047
The obvious places have been
wiped clean of prints.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.546
The key was never turned in.
But Smith paid with a new $50 bill.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.288
The manager made a deposit last night.
We're in touch with the bank.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.320
Victim? Her prints aren't in the system.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.162
Harland's checking a kids' day camp.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.828
How close a match is it to the other killings?

07:04.858 --> 07:07.168
It's the same belt size,
buckle under the right ear,

07:07.193 --> 07:10.140
same puncture wounds with the
same left-handed orientation.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.165
The victim's dark blonde, like the others.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.075
The place looked like a hurricane hit it.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.013
It's a rage murder, the same
signature as The Motel Ripper.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.143
Since Kevin Reddick,
The Motel Ripper did those killings,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.847
and he's in Rikers awaiting trial,
we're talking about a copycat.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.584
Except the signature was never made public.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.683
Someone found out what it was,
because they copied it.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.422
Assuming Kevin Reddick
is really The Motel Ripper.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.694
( sighs ) When Reddick was
pulled over six months ago,

07:34.721 --> 07:37.861
he had news clippings of the five
murders in his briefcase,

07:37.891 --> 07:42.033
no alibi, he wears
a size 34 belt, he's left-handed,

07:42.062 --> 07:45.202
and he has a history
of abusive relationships with women.

07:45.231 --> 07:48.838
I'll worry about convicting
Reddick on those killings.

07:48.868 --> 07:52.042
As for this one, I suggest
someone leaked the details

07:52.072 --> 07:55.417
of the signature, or Reddick
bragged to one of his cellmates.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.049
( phone ringing )

07:59.079 --> 08:01.184
Deakins.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.492
I'll let them know.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.191
Harland got an ID on the kid's mother.

08:09.589 --> 08:11.660
Man: Rosa was real careful.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.695
She never brought any of her,
you know, "friends" home.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.504
Even when Petey stayed with his dad.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.840
Well, she's not much of a housekeeper.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.346
As long as she kept the place vermin-free.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.007
She have any friends in the building?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.847
She had me and the missus. Poor girl.

08:31.878 --> 08:35.519
"Free cover, free drink.
Ladies' night, every Tuesday."

08:35.548 --> 08:37.687
Last night's coupon is missing.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.328
Woman: Rosa something.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.061
Comes in every other week.

08:43.089 --> 08:46.070
Last night she was here.
She left with somebody.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.572
No. It was a her.

08:48.595 --> 08:51.041
Ladies' night, as in "ladies' only" night.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.203
Eames: The other girl,
had you seen her before?

08:53.233 --> 08:56.043
No. She was nice looking, blonde, 30s.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.208
Pink blouse and a brown skirt.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.240
Street, casual, young professional?

09:00.273 --> 09:02.116
She was going for casual.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.622
She was at the bar for a while,
checking things out.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.646
Definitely "bi-nervous."

09:06.679 --> 09:09.990
One more thing, did either of
them have anything to eat?

09:10.016 --> 09:12.155
- Fries or burger?
- No.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.290
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.425
The hand towel at the motel.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.766
There were no ketchup
stains on Rosa's clothing,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.863
maybe on our mystery woman?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.033
She ate on the way here, or
on her way back to the motel.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.134
That means we'll be hitting
all the burger joints

09:25.165 --> 09:27.270
between here and there.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.679
All the lights are down.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.705
Yeah.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.310
I like this place.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.850
I followed the list exactly like you said.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.259
I didn't think I could do it.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.898
Yeah, I did that too.

09:47.921 --> 09:52.768
Yeah. Yeah. Do we have to--

09:54.594 --> 09:58.201
(whimpering)
Okay, I'll tell you.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.974
I'll-- I'll--
I'll tell you everything.

10:02.001 --> 10:05.881
Yeah, I pulled on them.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.922
As hard as I could.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.255
The waitress at Potter's Grill
saw you sharing fries with her.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.526
It's very important that we find her.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.727
I just met her that night.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.963
All I know is, she's from Ohio.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.063
Her name is Mary Ellen.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.734
She said she was starting a new job yesterday.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.970
A design company on Northern Boulevard.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.001
I was going to help her find the address.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.173
You left with her?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.274
No. I changed my mind.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.711
I'm not saying she meant anything by it,

10:42.742 --> 10:45.518
but she wanted to stop
by her motel room first.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.456
She was coming on to you?

10:48.548 --> 10:51.324
Well, I'm not saying for sure.

10:51.351 --> 10:55.026
Please... don't lie to us.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.796
I'm not lying. Your ears are turning red.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.826
My mother taught me what that means.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.498
Was it Mary Ellen who changed her mind?

11:03.530 --> 11:06.602
Eames: You don't want people to
know about your personal life.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.011
That's understandable.

11:09.035 --> 11:11.538
Goren: Either way, you're a very lucky woman.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.251
The next girl that Mary Ellen picked up,

11:15.275 --> 11:17.585
she was found dead in that motel room.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.920
Oh my God.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.652
That could've been me.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.395
I was going to leave with her...

11:30.423 --> 11:32.767
But when she found out I was a teacher,

11:32.792 --> 11:35.500
I don't know, all of a sudden,
she said she had to get up early.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.940
She just left.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.843
Oh my God. I can't believe--

11:40.867 --> 11:43.404
can you excuse me?

11:44.470 --> 11:46.450
Mary Ellen was making choices.

11:46.472 --> 11:49.112
The mother of a seven-year-old
is fair game, but not a teacher?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.452
( cell phone ringing )

11:51.477 --> 11:53.616
Eames.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.456
How long? All right. Thanks.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.621
Latent found the $50 bill from the motel.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.131
They're pulling prints.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.465
(man snoring)

12:11.531 --> 12:13.636
( loud clattering )

12:13.666 --> 12:15.612
Sorry about that, Johnny.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.343
John "Johnny" West.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.079
- You were advised of your rights?
- Uh-huh.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.417
You want to take care of this now
or wait for your lawyer?

12:23.443 --> 12:26.981
- Let's do it now.
- Goren: Okay, Tuesday-- what did
you do Tuesday?

12:27.013 --> 12:29.357
I got high.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.555
At the Aladdin Motel?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.723
No, I never been there.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.063
This is you checking in, Johnny.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.160
No, that ain't me.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.297
This is the money you paid with.
It's got your fingerprints on it.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.605
Yeah, okay, it's me.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.279
You were with a girl... a blonde?

12:50.303 --> 12:53.113
Yeah, I mean, you know,

12:53.139 --> 12:55.449
we got down to the business.
( chuckles )

12:55.475 --> 12:59.116
You and her and her little
friend she brought along?

12:59.145 --> 13:01.386
No.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.187
No, I never seen her.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.756
- How about now?
- No! No!

13:11.057 --> 13:14.368
Your blonde friend picked
her up Tuesday night.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.806
She's not my friend.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.309
I met her outside of a bodega on Astoria--

13:19.332 --> 13:21.334
I mean, she paid me to rent that room.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.870
Eames: Because you’re such a stud?

13:23.903 --> 13:27.373
No. She told me exactly what to say.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.785
"Ask for a room in the back,
because I want to get some sleep."

13:29.809 --> 13:32.380
I think that she wants me and her to...

13:32.412 --> 13:35.393
But no, she didn't.

13:35.415 --> 13:39.261
She gave me another $50
and told me to get lost. So I did.

13:39.285 --> 13:42.698
Eames: You did a stint in Rikers
back in December for possession?

13:42.722 --> 13:44.861
- Yeah.
- You met Kevin Reddick.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.893
- You were on the same tier as him?
- Who--?

13:46.926 --> 13:49.873
The Motel Ripper. You picked up
a few tricks from him--

13:49.896 --> 13:51.967
like what kind of belt to use...
I never talked to him!

13:51.998 --> 13:55.343
...where to stab her. Get that away from me!

13:55.368 --> 13:57.780
You copied Reddick's signature so well,

13:57.804 --> 14:00.250
the DA’s talking about charging
you with all the murders.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.981
Get that away from me!

14:07.714 --> 14:10.558
You're a meth-head, isn't that right?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.827
But you don't shoot up?

14:13.853 --> 14:17.027
No. I don't like needles.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.630
( clicks )

14:21.661 --> 14:23.732
( wincing )
Oh, look at that.

14:23.763 --> 14:27.040
I see. I see! No, look at that. I cut myself.

14:27.066 --> 14:30.707
Come on, look. Look, it's
really coming out.

14:45.918 --> 14:48.023
He faints at the sight of blood.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.227
That's why he doesn't shoot up.

14:50.256 --> 14:54.898
It's an involuntary reflex.
Common in 10% of the population.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.998
They start hyperventilating,

14:57.029 --> 14:59.100
which causes pressure on the vagus nerve,

14:59.132 --> 15:02.909
heart rate slows down-- Pfft!

15:02.935 --> 15:05.472
What it means...

15:05.505 --> 15:08.679
He couldn't have cut her up.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.847
He wouldn't have.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.016
It's not him.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.927
Carver: Your little demonstration aside,

15:18.951 --> 15:21.227
Mr. West is still the only
candidate for this crime.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.393
Why not a woman? Maybe
Reddick has a girlfriend

15:23.423 --> 15:25.494
who wants to prove he's innocent.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.562
There's no evidence he has
a girlfriend. No wife,

15:27.593 --> 15:29.698
no sister, no "kissing cousin."

15:29.729 --> 15:31.766
We even investigated his two co-workers,

15:31.798 --> 15:34.608
at his building management
company. This woman--

15:34.634 --> 15:37.444
this Mary Ellen-- she had a job?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.643
Design firm on Northern
Boulevard. No such place.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.721
Whoever she is, Reddick would need
to be in contact with her now,

15:44.744 --> 15:47.850
giving her instructions, encouragement.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.053
So, we check prison visits,
letters, phone calls.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.585
The sooner you connect this
murder to Reddick, the better.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.292
His lawyer's going to court
this week to argue for bail.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.928
I don't want Mr. Reddick
out of jail for a second.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.438
Man: inmates get pre-paid calling cards.
We don't monitor the calls.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.503
Eames: What about the visitors' list?

16:08.534 --> 16:11.981
Reddick hasn't had any visitors of a
personal nature since he's been here.

16:12.004 --> 16:15.474
He's had lawyers, psychiatrists...

16:15.508 --> 16:17.545
Mr. Munoz.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.354
Inside his tape player.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.357
Goren: Look at that.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.856
I wouldn't want to show my face, either.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.235
"'Hot 4 U 4 Ever.'
Karyn."

16:37.230 --> 16:39.540
Talk about "keeping the home fires burning."

16:39.565 --> 16:41.704
I need a cigarette and 8 hours' sleep.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.772
This doesn't read like they've
been together on the outside.

16:44.804 --> 16:48.217
My bet is, this is the only
sex they've actually had.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.721
"You looked strong and powerful.

16:50.743 --> 16:54.054
It's good you've been out of the sun.
Your pale skin turns me on.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.185
Could you tell?"

16:58.451 --> 17:02.399
She's seen him... since he's been locked up.

17:02.421 --> 17:05.993
She's not on the visitors' list.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.833
He's been in court for pre-trial motions.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.434
When's that bail hearing?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.346
What prompts this motion for bail

17:19.372 --> 17:21.579
is new evidence that tends
to exculpate my client.

17:21.607 --> 17:25.020
Last week, a young woman
was found murdered in Queens

17:25.044 --> 17:28.856
in a manner identical to those
murders my clients accused of

17:28.881 --> 17:31.452
Carver: Your Honor, our
evidence against Mr. Reddick

17:31.484 --> 17:34.624
is the same now as it was when
you remanded him to custody.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.601
Judge: All right, Mr. Carver.
I'm continuing remand,

17:37.623 --> 17:40.399
but I want a full investigation,

17:40.426 --> 17:43.635
and I want the parties here in 30 days
to reconsider bail for Mr. Reddick.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.200
Next case.
( bangs gavel )

17:47.066 --> 17:49.137
Goren: Karyn?

17:49.168 --> 17:52.081
What?

17:52.104 --> 17:54.277
I told you, I didn't write those.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.981
Goren: That little move in the courtroom,

17:57.009 --> 17:59.922
is that a special request from Kevin?

17:59.946 --> 18:02.187
Eames: How about these?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.661
Kevin's "submissive little doggie."

18:13.859 --> 18:15.998
Goren: He ever ask you to hurt someone?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.701
( snaps )
No. And I wouldn't!

18:17.730 --> 18:19.835
Where were you Tuesday night last week?

18:19.865 --> 18:23.745
In class. I'm a French Lit major at NYU.
I'm not a criminal.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.648
He just asked me to pose for pictures.
They're just pictures.

18:26.672 --> 18:30.142
Nude pictures. For a serial killer.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.986
(huffs)

18:33.012 --> 18:35.390
You don't understand.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.521
When he talks to you,

18:38.551 --> 18:43.523
he talks to this... part of you.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.729
I can't explain it.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.863
You just want to do things for him.

18:47.893 --> 18:50.464
He's just so... hot--

18:50.496 --> 18:52.635
( slams )

18:54.900 --> 18:58.040
You want to see pictures
of what he did to those five girls?

18:58.070 --> 19:00.380
It's not "so hot."

19:00.406 --> 19:03.012
I know, he's got this brain disease.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.147
But he would never hurt me.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.521
He told you he had a brain disease?

19:10.516 --> 19:12.655
His shrink called me.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.824
He warned me to stop talking to Kevin,

19:14.854 --> 19:18.324
that he's dangerous. Like I didn't know.

19:18.357 --> 19:22.066
- But that's the whole point.
- The doctor's name?

19:22.094 --> 19:24.870
Buckman. Can I go now?

19:24.897 --> 19:27.002
I'm going to miss my study group.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.510
We're going to check your alibi, Karyn.

19:33.539 --> 19:37.544
Until you hear from us,
don't skip any classes.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.783
( door closes )

19:40.813 --> 19:43.953
Serial killer groupies.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.862
And I thought I was pathetic
with my ABBA fan club card.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.661
( chuckles )

19:48.688 --> 19:51.225
"Dr. Roger Buckman,
Haddon School of Medicine,

19:51.257 --> 19:53.897
Department of Neuropsychiatry."

19:55.227 --> 19:57.707
He visited Reddick at Rikers.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.577
Buckman: Reddick didn't tell
me about any other girls.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.809
He didn't even tell me about this one.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.411
But once I became aware she was putting
herself in danger, I had a duty to warn her.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.718
You told her Reddick had a "brain disease."

20:11.744 --> 20:14.224
Was that just to scare her?

20:14.246 --> 20:16.453
I told that ridiculous girl
people who commit these crimes

20:16.482 --> 20:19.827
have a brain disorder.
I never told her that Reddick did.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.059
I wouldn't violate his confidentiality.

20:22.088 --> 20:25.399
Is Reddick a patient or a test subject?

20:25.424 --> 20:27.597
Buckman: Test subject.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.038
I'm studying Limbic Trigger Syndrome.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.372
Certain chaotic violent behavior

20:32.398 --> 20:34.639
is caused by biological abnormalities

20:34.667 --> 20:37.079
in the limbic system of the brain.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.413
Chaotic behavior like rage killings?

20:39.438 --> 20:42.908
Yes. The subjects have lesions
in the limbic system.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.582
Over time, they cause partial seizures

20:45.611 --> 20:49.252
which are usually followed
by the violent behavior.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.420
What, you're saying that everyone

20:51.450 --> 20:54.488
with the lesion commits rage killings?

20:54.520 --> 20:57.091
No, I'm saying that every
rage killer has the lesion.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.797
Eames: Back to Karyn Barrett,

20:59.825 --> 21:02.431
how did you find out about
her relationship with Reddick?

21:02.461 --> 21:04.600
My research associate, Dr. Dwyer.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.837
Is the doctor in?

21:07.900 --> 21:10.039
Kevin bragged about toying with this girl.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.743
I was worried for her.
So I asked Dr. Buckman for advice.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.218
Eames: Did he brag about any other women?

21:15.241 --> 21:17.380
You know where to draw the line, Cathleen.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.685
I'm sure she does, Doctor.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.552
Thank you.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.364
No, he didn't mention anyone else.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.098
He bragged about Karyn to you.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.367
He must feel very comfortable around you.

21:36.395 --> 21:39.205
I think the point was
to make me uncomfortable.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.744
He likes to play games.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.909
Who sees him more often, you or Dr. Buckman?

21:46.939 --> 21:50.819
I do. I conduct the interviews.
I supervise the PET scans.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.756
Which one's Reddick?

21:54.780 --> 21:57.260
I can't tell you.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.786
And the ID tags are numbered.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.263
Your subjects, are they all serial killers?

22:05.291 --> 22:10.604
No. Kevin's the only one
accused of that class of crime.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.973
But they're all rage killers.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.040
I like the way you have things arranged--

22:18.070 --> 22:20.209
you know, books, boxes--

22:20.239 --> 22:23.709
all sorted by size. It's very...

22:25.144 --> 22:27.556
...orderly.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.117
A defense against the chaos in here.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.288
The lesion in the limbic
system, does it show up?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.527
Yes.

22:36.555 --> 22:39.798
It's there. That shadow
right by the hypothalamus.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.070
The limbic system,

22:44.096 --> 22:47.077
that governs emotion and motivation.

22:47.099 --> 22:51.047
- You've studied the field?
- By necessity.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.880
Family history of schizophrenia.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.112
If this study of yours pans out,

22:59.144 --> 23:01.886
it's a pretty good basis
for an insanity plea.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.192
Limbic Trigger Syndrome is a mental disease,

23:06.218 --> 23:08.698
so yes, there'd be legal ramifications.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.167
Eames: Like killers getting away with murder,

23:11.190 --> 23:14.797
Dr. Dwyer: They wouldn't get away
with anything, they'd get treatment.

23:14.827 --> 23:18.468
Your study will take, what,
five years to complete?

23:18.497 --> 23:21.637
And who knows how long

23:21.667 --> 23:24.307
before it's accepted
by the medical establishment?

23:27.573 --> 23:30.053
By then it’ll be too late for old Kevin.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.214
It's still helpful for him to understand

23:32.244 --> 23:34.315
why he behaves the way he does.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.721
This is...

23:40.219 --> 23:42.392
Very cutting edge stuff.

23:42.421 --> 23:47.564
It must be so exciting for you, doing
the research, teaching young students--

23:47.593 --> 23:50.199
I don't teach. I only do pure research.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.873
How did you get interested?
A professor inspired you?

23:55.935 --> 23:58.245
My mother, I guess.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.183
Before she died, she taught
high school biology.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.313
A teacher.

24:08.547 --> 24:12.188
I'm sure she'd be very proud of you.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.662
Thank you for talking to us, Doctor.

24:47.286 --> 24:51.234
A university researcher with a PhD?

24:51.256 --> 24:53.395
Rosa Dern's killer had a
soft spot for teachers.

24:53.425 --> 24:56.235
Dr. Dwyer's mother was a high school teacher.

24:56.261 --> 24:59.140
Dr. Dwyer spared the teacher
but killed the mother

24:59.164 --> 25:01.701
of a seven-year-old" that fits your profile?

25:01.734 --> 25:03.941
A mother who left her son
with her ex-husband

25:03.969 --> 25:06.040
while she had sex with strange
women in motel rooms.

25:06.071 --> 25:08.813
That was the point the killer was making

25:08.841 --> 25:11.515
by leaving the boy's picture
on top of Rosa Dern's clothes.

25:11.543 --> 25:15.355
Which by the way, were folded
neatly on top of the dresser.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.657
Not by Rosa Dern who was a slob,

25:17.683 --> 25:19.754
but by the killer.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.265
Dr. Dwyer's a neat freak.

25:22.287 --> 25:26.895
But why? Why would she commit such a crime?

25:28.560 --> 25:30.870
I'm not sure.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.569
( door opens )

25:32.598 --> 25:35.602
You should call your office. What?

25:35.634 --> 25:38.342
The Queens County DA has taken
jurisdiction over the Rosa Dern case,

25:38.370 --> 25:42.375
on the theory that she was killed by
someone unconnected to Kevin Reddick.

25:43.642 --> 25:47.215
They're saying whoever killed Rosa
Dern also killed the other five.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.894
If you really think Cathleen Dwyer did this,

25:50.916 --> 25:53.795
and you can connect her
to Reddick, do it fast.

25:58.590 --> 26:00.831
I'm stunned you're even asking.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.999
I can't think of an individual
less likely to commit a murder.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.838
How long have you known Dr. Dwyer?

26:05.864 --> 26:08.003
Eight years. Ever since the
university invited me here.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.843
She was a very bright,
very serious graduate student.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.485
She sounds like a lot of fun. Any boyfriends?

26:15.507 --> 26:18.181
You people do go for the obvious.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.690
I sat in on some of those sessions.

26:20.712 --> 26:23.192
They weren't blowing kisses at each other.

26:23.215 --> 26:26.025
Everybody keeps their game face for the boss.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.497
I'd be a pretty poor psychiatrist if I allowed

26:28.520 --> 26:32.024
someone's weak character to undermine
the integrity of my life's work.

26:32.057 --> 26:34.367
Other than the sessions you mentioned,

26:34.393 --> 26:37.374
Dr. Dwyer was alone with
Reddick the rest of the time?

26:37.396 --> 26:38.773
Yes.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.708
Does she have access to the crime reports,

26:40.732 --> 26:43.042
or did Dwyer tell her any
details of the killings?

26:43.068 --> 26:45.207
You mean the killer's unique signature?

26:45.237 --> 26:47.547
No, of course we don't have that data.

26:47.573 --> 26:51.885
And Reddick would not incriminate
himself by telling us.

26:51.910 --> 26:56.325
I see Dr. Dwyer had him brought
here for medical tests.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.693
Yes. Under guard, for his PET
scan, neurological evaluations.

26:59.718 --> 27:02.164
Were there other people?

27:02.187 --> 27:05.999
Technicians who might've
observed them together?

27:07.025 --> 27:09.562
Yes. Obviously.

27:09.595 --> 27:13.202
Yeah, that was a big day when Dr. Dwyer
brought in the Motel Ripper the first time.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.337
He's the most famous killer they got.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.869
The first time?

27:16.902 --> 27:19.610
Reddick had another PET scan?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.515
Yeah. They misplaced his first one.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.611
And then, Dr. Buckman said it was blurry,

27:23.642 --> 27:25.713
so they brought him back 3 months later.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.917
How was Dr. Dwyer with him?
Was she friendly?

27:27.946 --> 27:29.948
Well, not the first time. But the second...

27:29.982 --> 27:33.191
She was fussing all over him, holding
his coat, getting him water.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.289
Goren: That's unprofessional.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.425
I've seen her like that with Dr. Buckman.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.299
But this was different?

27:39.324 --> 27:42.931
During his PET scan, she held his hand.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.869
I mean, I don't know if he was nervous,

27:46.899 --> 27:50.142
but to stand there for 45 minutes
holding that man's hand? Um-mm.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.843
Holding hands with a serial killer.

27:52.871 --> 27:55.750
Sounds like probable cause
for a search warrant.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.553
Super: Are you sure you can just come in here?

28:00.579 --> 28:02.320
Don't you have to tell Dr. Dwyer?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.827
No, we don't. You mind waiting in the hallway?

28:04.850 --> 28:07.353
Has this place just been painted?
I smell fresh paint.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.128
About a month ago. Before Dr. Dwyer moved in.

28:12.024 --> 28:15.995
I am not finding a pink top or a brown skirt.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.339
Family photos.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.005
Here's Dwyer skateboarding with a neck brace.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.015
Tough kid.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.948
Dwyer; Dwyer and Mom...

28:26.972 --> 28:28.974
There's no pictures of Dad.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.613
What did I tell you
about "the negligent dad"?

28:31.643 --> 28:33.816
I don't know. I forgot to write it down.

28:35.814 --> 28:38.488
What have we here?

28:41.386 --> 28:44.333
Dr. Dwyer's "secret garden."

28:44.356 --> 28:46.836
Novels by Yukio Mishima.

28:46.858 --> 28:49.429
Domination porno for intellectuals.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.635
Magazines. This is rough stuff.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.701
"Total Submission."

28:56.034 --> 28:58.173
Dr. Dwyer likes a "strong daddy."

28:58.203 --> 29:01.343
Reddick's the right man for the job.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.617
Her student loans.

29:08.647 --> 29:10.923
She owed a couple of bricks.

29:10.949 --> 29:13.793
Collection notices, overdue credit cards.

29:13.819 --> 29:16.425
You got to wonder how she
can afford this place.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.299
- How much is the rent here?
- Cheap. It's rent-controlled.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.326
How did Dr. Dwyer get it?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.362
Super: I don't know.
There was a long waiting list.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.308
Then all of a sudden, she
pops up and moves in.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.274
What company manages the building?

29:30.302 --> 29:32.509
Super: Gump & Worsley.

29:32.537 --> 29:35.143
Kevin Reddick's old employer.

29:36.341 --> 29:38.719
They were in my apartment,
Kevin, in my bedroom.

29:38.744 --> 29:42.624
They looked through my things,
they touched everything.

29:42.648 --> 29:46.596
- What did they take?
- Just the financial papers.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.791
That’s it?

29:52.391 --> 29:56.498
Yes. There was nothing for them to find.
What are we going to do now?

29:56.528 --> 30:00.999
You're going to sit tight.
You're going to be okay.

30:01.033 --> 30:04.674
I don't know if I can-- You
remember how you were before?

30:04.703 --> 30:07.274
You thought you were too weak,
that you couldn't do it.

30:07.306 --> 30:11.345
But I said you could.
I told you could, and you did.

30:13.078 --> 30:15.558
Doesn't that make you feel good,

30:15.580 --> 30:18.720
that I know what you’re able to do?

30:20.085 --> 30:23.658
You had the strength all along.

30:24.756 --> 30:28.932
You just needed the right man.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.907
As long as nothing comes between us,

30:34.933 --> 30:38.710
no cops, no fears, no doubts...

30:39.771 --> 30:43.412
Everything will be fine.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.927
( stammers )
I can't. I don't want to.

31:01.126 --> 31:03.732
( whimpers )
No, don't go.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.901
I'm done here.

31:05.931 --> 31:09.208
Please. Stay.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.382
Yeah...

31:31.256 --> 31:34.237
All right, big deal, so Reddick
called me about Dr. Dwyer.

31:34.259 --> 31:37.240
What did Reddick say when he called you?

31:37.262 --> 31:39.401
He said he had this lady friend
who was living in a dump.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.502
He wanted to show her what a good guy he was.

31:41.533 --> 31:44.537
Kevin took good care of my building,
so why not do him a favor?

31:44.569 --> 31:48.745
This is a girl who had problems
paying her student loan every month.

31:48.774 --> 31:51.414
Weren't you taking a big risk?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.423
Kevin told you what,

31:53.445 --> 31:55.618
that she'd do you favors? That she was hot?

31:55.647 --> 31:58.423
Reddick just said that this
girl was a little kinky

31:58.450 --> 32:00.930
and if I played my cards right, then--

32:00.952 --> 32:04.195
- Kinky?
- Yeah, she likes to take direction.

32:04.222 --> 32:07.499
He told me she had a whole collection
of erotica on the subject.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.803
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Excuse me.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.401
Yeah? Hello. Yeah.

32:14.433 --> 32:18.438
Serves Dwyer right for telling
Reddick she had that stuff.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.110
You really think she told him?

32:21.139 --> 32:23.380
She lives alone.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.945
She had it hidden in the
back of her linen closet.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.218
She's ashamed of it.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.920
If she didn't tell him, who did?

32:32.317 --> 32:34.854
Attorney: So, Dr. Dwyer killed Rosa Dern

32:34.886 --> 32:37.059
for two rooms with a river view?

32:37.088 --> 32:40.069
Carver: She killed for needs
far more basic than housing.

32:40.091 --> 32:43.402
Needs he's uniquely adept at exploiting.

32:43.428 --> 32:46.238
Flattery will get you nowhere, Mr. Carver.

32:46.264 --> 32:49.711
We thought you wanted to talk
about your legal predicament.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.873
My only predicament here is deciding

32:51.903 --> 32:54.042
which tie to wear at your client's execution.

32:54.072 --> 32:56.348
Of course, if he gives me a reason

32:56.374 --> 32:58.149
to take the death penalty off the table--

32:58.176 --> 33:00.053
A reason?

33:00.078 --> 33:02.854
His testimony against Dr. Dwyer,

33:02.881 --> 33:06.351
that she agreed to commit
a murder on his behalf.

33:06.384 --> 33:09.524
Thanks to the Queens County DA,

33:09.554 --> 33:12.592
my client is already halfway out the door.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.797
- I got it.
- What?

33:14.826 --> 33:17.170
- A red tie.
- Goodbye.

33:17.195 --> 33:19.197
Goren: I have to know.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.711
All that stuff you told
your buddy about Dr. Dwyer,

33:21.733 --> 33:24.737
you made that up, didn't you?
I mean, Dr. Dwyer?

33:24.769 --> 33:26.771
Attorney: Kevin, let's go.

33:26.805 --> 33:30.252
That educated, uptight little scientist?

33:30.275 --> 33:33.347
Not in a million years
would she tell some creep

33:33.378 --> 33:36.291
she's never been intimate with
her nasty little secrets.

33:36.314 --> 33:41.024
I mean, especially a creep like you.
No woman would.

33:41.052 --> 33:43.726
I wouldn't. Not even if I
was going to marry the guy.

33:48.260 --> 33:52.402
Well, I guess I just have
a way with the ladies.

33:52.430 --> 33:55.934
Maybe with mixed-up college kids...

33:56.935 --> 33:59.677
But not Cathleen Dwyer.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.583
You're not that good.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.750
You expect us to believe

34:06.778 --> 34:11.454
that little mouse had the idea--
much less the will--

34:11.483 --> 34:13.860
to strangle and stab some poor woman

34:13.885 --> 34:17.628
without some input from you?

34:17.656 --> 34:21.001
You have no idea what's
inside that head of hers.

34:21.025 --> 34:25.440
I think I have an idea it's not filled
with what you'd like it to be--

34:26.431 --> 34:30.469
dominance, submission, pain.

34:30.502 --> 34:34.382
That's your fantasy, not hers.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.943
No. No.

34:36.975 --> 34:39.284
She loves that stuff.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.989
She told me once, she let a guy
twist her up so much,

34:46.016 --> 34:48.293
he dislocated her shoulder.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.425
Attorney: Kevin, let's go.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.569
- ( door closes)
- Dislocated shoulder?

35:00.599 --> 35:03.443
You'd go to the emergency
room for that, wouldn't you?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.541
( fax beeps )

35:07.539 --> 35:11.214
Four years ago, Cathleen Dwyer walked
into her neighborhood hospital,

35:11.242 --> 35:13.279
complaining of severe shoulder pain.

35:13.311 --> 35:15.382
The bill was paid with a credit card.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.359
One of her maxed-out credit cards?

35:17.382 --> 35:20.192
No, this cardholder had excellent credit.

35:20.218 --> 35:23.893
Dr. Roger Buckman. They had an affair.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.732
He'd know about Dr. Dwyer's kinks.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.763
He could have been the one who told Reddick.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.900
Isn't that a dangerous thing to tell
a serial killer about a colleague?

35:32.931 --> 35:36.344
Not to mention bad manners?
Unless you're priming the pump.

35:36.368 --> 35:39.577
I wonder if the university knows
what goes on in their research labs?

35:42.574 --> 35:44.611
Woman: The affair was years ago.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.714
Anyway, we're a university, not a monastery.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.725
Eames: How have things
been between them lately?

35:48.747 --> 35:51.887
Only one thing I'm aware of. Two months ago,

35:51.916 --> 35:55.386
Dr. Dwyer asked the Review Board to
mediate a dispute with Dr. Buckman.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.196
She wanted to stop doing
the interviews with Kevin Reddick.

35:58.223 --> 36:01.432
- Why?
- They were making her uncomfortable.

36:01.459 --> 36:04.770
But a few days later,
Dr. Dwyer withdrew her objections.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.841
Buckman pressured her?

36:08.867 --> 36:12.508
The pressure's on for results.
Funding was nearly cut last summer.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.185
Buckman turned things around?

36:16.207 --> 36:18.517
He made a very strong
argument that cutting funding

36:18.543 --> 36:21.023
before he had a chance to study Reddick

36:21.046 --> 36:23.856
would be a disservice to the community.

36:23.882 --> 36:27.853
The decision was validated when Dr.
Buckman presented Reddick's PET scan.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.298
The lesion was clearly present.

36:31.890 --> 36:35.895
Can we see the PET scan
he presented to the Review Board?

36:40.065 --> 36:42.204
I just got this from the PET scan lab.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.372
All the PET scans charged off to the study.

36:44.402 --> 36:47.872
These things aren't cheap. $1,500 bucks a pop.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.887
Even Buckman got a PET scan, and Dwyer.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.219
Looks like all the researchers got one.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.884
They're part of the control group.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.726
Okay, here's the charge
for Reddick's first PET scan.

36:59.751 --> 37:04.666
They flubbed it, but
they still charged for it.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.999
And here's the second one 3 months later.

37:07.025 --> 37:09.869
Reddick's the only
test subject they did twice.

37:11.029 --> 37:13.635
I need to see a doctor.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.880
Moving out?

37:26.544 --> 37:29.047
Soon enough.

37:31.549 --> 37:33.688
Dr. Buckman, this is Ron Carver

37:33.718 --> 37:35.857
from the District Attorney's office.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.889
Yes, what's this about?

37:41.059 --> 37:43.630
Goren: Come on in, Dr. Dwyer.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.208
Maybe she can testify too.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.714
There's a hearing tomorrow on a motion

37:51.736 --> 37:54.376
to dismiss charges against Kevin Reddick.

37:54.405 --> 37:56.885
I'd like you to testify as expert witnesses.

37:56.908 --> 38:00.720
You made a speech. It was
at the Harvard Medical School.

38:00.745 --> 38:04.659
Here it is. You said,
"The Motel Ripper homicides

38:04.682 --> 38:07.686
fit the profile of rage killings.
And when the perpetrator is identified,

38:07.719 --> 38:10.495
I have no doubt"-- no doubt--

38:10.522 --> 38:13.332
"that he will be found to have
a lesion in the limbic system

38:13.358 --> 38:16.498
of his brain which triggers
his chaotic and violent behavior."

38:16.528 --> 38:18.667
- That was what you said.
- Yes, that's right.

38:18.696 --> 38:20.334
At Harvard.

38:20.365 --> 38:23.505
When they caught Reddick, he had the
lesion, just like you predicted.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.846
That's what we need you to say on the stand.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.509
Well, the study isn't done yet.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.747
I'm not sure that a court
of law is the best forum.

38:30.775 --> 38:33.016
What?

38:33.044 --> 38:35.684
You already said on record

38:35.713 --> 38:38.193
that the Motel Ripper will have the lesion.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.425
I have another quote from you.

38:44.889 --> 38:47.199
Goren: Oh!

38:48.226 --> 38:49.933
Oh jeez, I'm sorry.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.669
We didn't mean to embarrass you, Dr. Dwyer.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.546
( stammers )
W-why would I be embarrassed?

38:56.568 --> 38:59.174
Well, you had these hidden
in your apartment.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.485
You know, Reddick told us

39:03.508 --> 39:06.887
you were interested in this kind of activity,
to cast aspersions on your character.

39:06.911 --> 39:10.051
Reddick doesn't know.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.136
You didn't tell him?

39:24.863 --> 39:27.469
Then it must've been Dr. Buckman.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.381
That's why Reddick knew
about the dislocated shoulder.

39:33.404 --> 39:35.406
- Cathleen, I swear to you--
- Goren: It's okay.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.681
You were trying to establish
a rapport with Reddick--

39:37.709 --> 39:40.747
telling stories out of school
about some woman you slept with.

39:40.778 --> 39:44.157
That is absolutely false.
You would know if it's true.

39:46.951 --> 39:49.158
Reddick seemed to have

39:49.187 --> 39:52.225
this uncanny ability to read your mind...

39:54.058 --> 39:56.698
And your desires.

39:56.728 --> 40:00.141
No wonder he had an unfair advantage.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.201
Cathleen, don't listen to this nonsense.

40:02.233 --> 40:06.010
You felt he understood you.
You started feeling attracted to him

40:06.037 --> 40:08.711
and that's why you tried to back out.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.220
But Buckman pressured you--

40:11.242 --> 40:14.348
forced you into Reddick's presence.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.387
Why?

40:26.424 --> 40:29.064
You must've known what he'd do with her.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.199
With her need to submit?

40:32.230 --> 40:34.437
Buckman: I don't know what
you’re talking about.

40:34.465 --> 40:38.345
Yeah, I wasn't sure either,
until I found a paper that you wrote

40:38.369 --> 40:41.578
10 years ago about the Hillside
Strangler in California.

40:41.606 --> 40:46.783
He convinced his girlfriend to commit
a copycat murder to exculpate him.

40:50.481 --> 40:53.155
That's what he had planned for you?

40:54.719 --> 40:57.495
To help exonerate Reddick?

40:57.522 --> 41:01.527
Not because he isn't
the Motel Ripper, but because...

41:01.559 --> 41:04.403
He doesn't have a lesion.

41:04.429 --> 41:06.568
He doesn't have limbic trigger syndrome.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.736
That's ridiculous. Reddick has the lesion--

41:08.766 --> 41:12.373
You knew, the minute you saw
his first PET scan.

41:12.403 --> 41:14.747
The theory you staked your whole career on...

41:14.772 --> 41:18.310
was crap.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.846
And sooner or later,
someone was going to find out

41:20.878 --> 41:23.358
that Reddick did not have the lesions.

41:23.381 --> 41:26.328
So you buried that PET scan,
and you gave the Review Board

41:26.351 --> 41:29.195
another one from some
other subject, to what?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.723
To buy time, so you could
figure out a graceful way

41:31.756 --> 41:34.066
to knock Reddick out of your study?

41:34.092 --> 41:36.436
And you did that by...

41:36.461 --> 41:40.341
Giving him someone he could
dominate and manipulate?

41:40.365 --> 41:43.403
Who had the mental equipment...

41:43.434 --> 41:46.176
Who had the predisposition to kill.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.707
Dr. Dwyer, the PET scan--

41:50.174 --> 41:55.248
showing the lesion, on what Dr.
Buckman claims to be Reddick's brain...

41:55.279 --> 41:58.590
What are those faint shadows there?

41:58.616 --> 42:01.222
They're difficult to see
if you’re not looking for them.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.732
Those are the cervical vertebrae.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.730
What's that right there?

42:10.128 --> 42:12.199
An injury to the disk.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.608
Between C2 and C3?

42:14.632 --> 42:16.703
Yeah.

42:16.734 --> 42:21.114
That's the injury you got when you
were roller skating as a child?

42:24.909 --> 42:27.389
This is your PET scan.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.790
And the lesion?

42:29.814 --> 42:32.124
It's in your brain.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.836
And you knew that, didn't you, Doctor?

42:46.831 --> 42:49.277
You knew that, and you used her.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.804
- Oh, no. No--
- Oh my God-- oh my God!

42:52.837 --> 42:54.145
No. Don't listen to that.

42:54.172 --> 42:56.482
You son of a bitch!

42:56.507 --> 42:57.918
Keep that crazy woman away from me.

42:57.942 --> 43:00.354
You son of a bitch. How could you?!

43:00.378 --> 43:02.517
How could you do this to me!?

43:02.547 --> 43:04.959
Dr. Buckman, you're under arrest for murder.

43:04.982 --> 43:08.020
( Dwyer screams )
It's him! It's him! You bastard!

43:08.052 --> 43:11.727
You stupid burned-out quack!
I hate you, you creep.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.201
( screaming continues )

43:13.224 --> 43:16.364
So, she had a lesion
and she committed murder.

43:16.394 --> 43:19.500
Doesn't that prove Dr. Buckman's theory?

43:20.731 --> 43:23.211
She wasn't driven to kill out of rage.

43:23.234 --> 43:26.078
- She chose to kill out of love.
- Love?

43:26.104 --> 43:29.051
It's "a many splendored thing."

43:34.345 --> 43:37.554
( theme music playing )

43:38.305 --> 43:44.650
