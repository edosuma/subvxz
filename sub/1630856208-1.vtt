I can't.

Have a good day.

04:49.772 --> 04:51.877
Young woman: Wait.
Is someone still in here?

04:51.981 --> 04:54.155
Young woman #2:
It's that quiet girl.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.573
Hey!

04:57.676 --> 04:58.884
Bye.

05:09.412 --> 05:11.345
Witchcraft.

05:11.449 --> 05:13.382
The official town record
blames the fire

05:13.485 --> 05:16.074
on an unholy coven
of the devil's witches.

05:16.177 --> 05:18.283
But, remember, history isn't
always what actually happened.

05:18.387 --> 05:19.629
It's what people say happened,

05:19.733 --> 05:20.872
what they wrote down
at the time,

05:20.975 --> 05:23.357
and how others
interpret it later.

05:23.461 --> 05:25.083
Slide, please.

05:26.464 --> 05:28.673
Young woman:
So there were no witches.

05:28.776 --> 05:31.054
Were there?

05:31.158 --> 05:34.264
What do you think?
Samantha?

05:38.303 --> 05:42.065
Witches aren't real,
but scapegoats are.

05:42.169 --> 05:44.378
They needed
to blame somebody.

05:44.482 --> 05:48.278
So why not make up
a story about witches?

05:48.382 --> 05:52.110
Well, witches or no witches,
the fire wiped out the town.

05:52.213 --> 05:54.181
The record lists
only four survivors,

05:54.284 --> 05:56.252
and they founded a new town
just down the mountain

05:56.356 --> 05:58.116
from where this very school
stands today.

05:59.635 --> 06:01.395
Okay. Have a lovely Christmas, everybody.

06:01.499 --> 06:03.293
And remember that your essays
are due

06:03.397 --> 06:06.089
right after break.

06:07.470 --> 06:10.024
Young woman:
I need, like, 20 new dresses.

06:12.682 --> 06:14.615
Young woman #2: Yeah.

06:18.032 --> 06:19.931
Young woman: Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

06:20.034 --> 06:21.691
Young woman #2: How can they
expect us to go to class

06:21.795 --> 06:23.762
when there's murderous,
psychotic killer on the loose?

06:25.212 --> 06:27.559
It's the third one
this week.

06:29.561 --> 06:32.115
That's less than 30 miles
from here.

06:32.219 --> 06:36.188
First one was in Danville.
Second was in Rivington.

06:36.292 --> 06:38.674
And last night's
was in Somerset.

06:38.777 --> 06:40.469
It's always the same thing.

06:40.572 --> 06:43.161
They pick a house
with a nice couple in it,

06:43.264 --> 06:44.818
and then they slash them up

06:44.921 --> 06:48.269
until only ribbons
of their flesh remain.

06:48.373 --> 06:50.686
Young woman: Ew.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.412
What does the symbol mean?

06:53.551 --> 06:56.312
Uh, probably some
Satanic shit, if you ask me.

06:58.003 --> 06:59.488
Young woman #2: Well, hopefully
they'll catch them

06:59.591 --> 07:01.041
before we get back
from break.

07:01.144 --> 07:03.837
Luckily, we'll be long gone
from here for a while.

07:05.735 --> 07:08.807
Well, most of us, anyway.

07:08.911 --> 07:11.396
Hey, Clara,
why don't you ever go home?

07:11.500 --> 07:13.329
Do your parents hate you
or something?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.124
Maybe she's an orphan.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.092
Since you'll be here all alone
over Christmas,

07:18.196 --> 07:20.992
I bet you'll have a lot of time
to work on your art.

07:21.095 --> 07:22.890
What are you working on?

07:25.514 --> 07:27.516
- Oh, my God.

07:27.619 --> 07:32.486
Girls.
Just what is this?

07:32.590 --> 07:34.971
It's the Christmas Killers, headmistress.

07:35.075 --> 07:37.836
And where did you get it?

07:37.940 --> 07:40.321
From
Miss Tanner's boyfriend.

07:42.151 --> 07:45.223
Horrible tragedy, but there's
no point scaring yourselves

07:45.326 --> 07:46.535
with this tabloid trash.

07:49.745 --> 07:51.988
Well, don't just sit there.
Get to class.

07:52.092 --> 07:54.163
Yes, Headmistress.

07:57.131 --> 07:59.340
I'll--
I'll-- I'll talk to Jimmy.

07:59.444 --> 08:01.066
Yes. Do.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.205
Mm-hmm.

08:12.457 --> 08:16.565
<i>♪ It came upon

08:19.568 --> 08:21.949

08:24.089 --> 08:28.024
"Christmas Killers
strike again."

08:28.128 --> 08:29.819
Do you think that's suitable
reading material

08:29.923 --> 08:31.821
for
impressionable young minds?

08:31.925 --> 08:33.996
Uh...'Cause I was thinking perhaps

08:34.099 --> 08:36.654
we can invite
the Cincinnati Strangler

08:36.757 --> 08:38.794
to give a lecture
on mass murder.

08:38.897 --> 08:40.830
Look, I mean,
they're asking me.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.487
What am I supposed to do--
lie to them?

08:42.591 --> 08:44.109
Well...

08:44.213 --> 08:49.080
no, but we don't need them
scaring each other.

08:49.183 --> 08:52.946
It's freaky enough
around here as it is.

08:53.049 --> 08:56.018
I need a break from here
and all this isolation.

08:56.121 --> 09:00.056
I shouldn't have agreed
to stay.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.888
And maybe next semester
I can get a public school job

09:03.991 --> 09:06.097
and be back
in civilization.

09:08.858 --> 09:10.446
I know what you need.

09:18.454 --> 09:22.354
You know the girls are also
calling you my boyfriend?

09:22.458 --> 09:23.632
Uh-oh.

09:23.735 --> 09:25.426
Well, we don't want that,
do we?

09:25.530 --> 09:27.532
Huh.

09:59.115 --> 10:03.188
Miss Kramer.
Your father left word.

10:03.292 --> 10:04.811
You can't just leave me here.

10:04.914 --> 10:06.398
Mr. Kramer:
Look, let's not make a scene.

10:06.502 --> 10:07.676
It's not fair.

10:07.779 --> 10:09.919
It's just one Christmas.

10:10.023 --> 10:12.370
You said...
I know.

10:12.473 --> 10:13.923
You promised.

10:14.027 --> 10:15.407
I know.

10:17.927 --> 10:20.550
I just want to go home.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.345
Put the woman back on.

10:25.314 --> 10:28.869
Yes, Mr. Kramer.
We understand.

10:28.973 --> 10:31.423
Yes, of course.
Plans change.

10:31.527 --> 10:33.322
These things
can't be helped.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.564
No, it's no problem
at all.

10:36.601 --> 10:38.568
Oh, well, no, actually.
I won't be here.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.915
But we have a teacher

10:40.018 --> 10:41.882
and one of the other girls
who will be.

11:14.950 --> 11:17.193
Wait! No, no.

11:17.297 --> 11:19.195
No. What? What? No!

11:19.299 --> 11:21.404
Stop! Oh! No!

11:21.508 --> 11:22.889
Let's see what we got here.

11:22.992 --> 11:24.373
No.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.618
You were right.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.691
There it is.

11:31.794 --> 11:33.762
Told you.
Just like the others.

11:33.865 --> 11:35.349
It's all in the book.

11:38.663 --> 11:40.630
No. No,
you don't want to do this!

11:40.734 --> 11:42.736
Oh, but we do.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.704
No, please! No.

11:48.086 --> 11:50.054
Yes.

11:55.231 --> 11:56.750
No.

12:00.443 --> 12:02.204
Almost there.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.699
Thank you, Father.

12:14.803 --> 12:16.356
You've been
a great help.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.668
Don't let it out!

12:18.772 --> 12:20.360
Shut him up.

12:34.201 --> 12:36.203
Young woman:
We're gonna go shopping.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.128
All right. Treat
for the road-- gingerbread.

13:04.231 --> 13:06.440
- Oh, I'll take one.
- Me too.

13:06.544 --> 13:08.546
Samantha?

13:11.549 --> 13:12.619
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

13:12.722 --> 13:14.863
I'll get that
for you.

13:16.968 --> 13:19.039
All right, girls.
Last ride to the station...

13:19.143 --> 13:21.076
...leaves now.

13:23.699 --> 13:24.700
I'll be back soon.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.667
Can't wait.

13:34.572 --> 13:35.884
You're staying?

13:37.747 --> 13:40.129
Hey, hey.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.166
I know this isn't ideal,
but we're gonna have fun.

13:42.269 --> 13:44.306
I promise.

13:47.550 --> 13:51.140
Well, someone's not feeling
the Christmas spirit.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.942
Is that the last of them?

14:00.046 --> 14:01.254
That's everybody
who's leaving.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.256
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

14:03.359 --> 14:05.258
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:05.361 --> 14:07.260
I made you something
for Christmas.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.055
Ah. Thanks, Jimmy.

14:09.158 --> 14:11.609
If I'm not here
when you get back,

14:11.712 --> 14:13.024
have a merry Christmas.

14:13.128 --> 14:16.338
I have a feeling I will.

14:16.441 --> 14:18.443
<i>We're just getting word now
that this could be linked</i>

14:18.547 --> 14:20.480
<i>to the murders
from a nearby county...</i>

14:20.583 --> 14:22.551
<i>homicides which some
have already dubbed</i>

14:22.654 --> 14:24.346
<i>the Christmas Killings.</i>

14:24.449 --> 14:27.073
<i>Local holiday carolers
are being questioned by police,</i>

14:27.176 --> 14:28.695
<i>whom are believed
to have been the last</i>

14:28.798 --> 14:31.732
<i>to have seen Arthur
and Marion O'Malley alive.</i>

14:31.836 --> 14:32.975
Ever bake a pie
from scratch?

14:33.079 --> 14:34.632
<i>Back to you, Roger.</i>

14:34.735 --> 14:36.427
No.

14:36.530 --> 14:38.222
Do you want to learn?

14:38.325 --> 14:40.845
Not really.

14:40.949 --> 14:42.329
Little known fact--

14:42.433 --> 14:44.159
The secret
to the perfect pie crust

14:44.262 --> 14:47.369
is butter, shortening,
and vodka.

14:48.991 --> 14:50.579
Do you want to grab a bottle
from the basement?

14:50.682 --> 14:53.858
Cook keeps them
in the pantry.

14:53.962 --> 14:56.274
Not enticed by alcohol?

14:56.378 --> 14:58.276
What kind of teenager
are you?

15:03.972 --> 15:06.250
Why don't you see
what Clara's up to?

15:06.353 --> 15:07.389
No, thanks.

15:07.492 --> 15:09.149
What's that saying?

15:09.253 --> 15:11.945
"Blackvale girls look out
for each other."

15:19.504 --> 15:24.578
Do you want to talk about
what's going on?

15:24.682 --> 15:26.960
Because I know that
this is a difficult time and--

15:27.064 --> 15:30.930
My stepdad said to try
this place out for one semester.

15:31.033 --> 15:33.380
And I did.

15:33.484 --> 15:37.108
But he lied.

15:37.212 --> 15:40.870
He just doesn't want
to deal with me.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.460
Nothing's been the same since.

15:44.564 --> 15:48.395
I just don't have any say
over anything.

15:48.499 --> 15:50.328
I'm just stuck.

15:56.093 --> 15:58.958
Look...

15:59.061 --> 16:01.477
you may feel trapped now.

16:01.581 --> 16:03.997
But you're not gonna be
a teenager forever.

16:04.101 --> 16:07.690
And soon you'll get to live life
on your own terms.

16:10.590 --> 16:13.696
And in the immediate future,
there's pie.

16:15.629 --> 16:16.734
Where in the basement?

16:16.837 --> 16:17.977
It's in the nook,

16:18.080 --> 16:19.702
right at the bottom
of the steps.

16:22.947 --> 16:24.845
Thank you, Samantha.

16:24.949 --> 16:26.537
Mm-hmm.

16:31.162 --> 16:32.405
<i>...who say
they were under orders</i>

16:32.508 --> 16:35.546
<i>to kill everyone
in the village.</i>

17:37.401 --> 17:39.127
You're not supposed
to be down here.

17:39.230 --> 17:43.096
And neither are you.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.546
Miss Tanner sent me.

17:44.649 --> 17:46.410
You've never been?

17:46.513 --> 17:47.894
No.

17:47.997 --> 17:50.862
You spend a lot of time
down here?

17:50.966 --> 17:52.864
I keep to myself.

18:19.374 --> 18:21.928
What are these?

18:22.031 --> 18:23.999
The books they don't
want us to read.

18:27.658 --> 18:30.350
Hey, I'm really sorry
about last night...

18:30.454 --> 18:31.869
that I barged in on you
like that.

18:31.972 --> 18:33.008
It's fine.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.285
I didn't see anything.

18:34.389 --> 18:36.391
There was nothing to see.

18:39.497 --> 18:40.636
Hey.

18:40.740 --> 18:43.674
Look what I have.

18:43.777 --> 18:46.401
Do-- Do you want some?

18:46.504 --> 18:48.575
Sure.

19:04.212 --> 19:06.628
I like your necklace.

19:06.731 --> 19:08.423
Oh.

19:08.526 --> 19:11.633
Thanks.
My mom gave it to me.

19:11.736 --> 19:14.463
How'd she die?

19:14.567 --> 19:16.327
What?

19:17.742 --> 19:19.019
That...

19:19.123 --> 19:22.713
That's why
you're here, right?

19:22.816 --> 19:25.612
I overheard
the headmistress mention it.

19:25.716 --> 19:28.719
Sorry. I didn't realize
it was a secret.

19:28.822 --> 19:33.551
It's not a secret.
It's just personal.

19:33.655 --> 19:34.966
I don't really want
the other girls here

19:35.070 --> 19:36.796
to know about my life.

19:36.899 --> 19:39.385
I can understand that.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.148
It was a car accident.

19:44.252 --> 19:45.805
You were there?

19:45.908 --> 19:48.877
Yeah, I got out okay
and I ran to go get help.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.086
But by the time
I got back...

19:51.190 --> 19:52.881
It was too late.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.127
Your secret's safe
with me.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.613
Thanks.

20:02.546 --> 20:04.858
Well, I'm--
I'm gonna go back upstairs.

20:04.962 --> 20:08.966
I promised Miss Tanner
I'd help her bake a pie, so...

20:09.069 --> 20:11.831
Are you gonna stay?

20:11.934 --> 20:13.246
Um...

20:13.350 --> 20:15.075
No. No, I'll go, too.

No.
No, w-we're fine, Officer.

22:31.004 --> 22:32.074
Mm.
Thank you.

22:32.178 --> 22:33.317
- Just a little shaken up.
- Mm-hmm.

22:33.421 --> 22:36.147
Mm.
How fast were you going?

22:36.251 --> 22:37.390
Oh, we were going
the speed limit.

22:37.494 --> 22:39.150

Not too far from here.

23:24.955 --> 23:27.129
Dinner's almost ready.
Are you okay?

23:27.233 --> 23:29.028
I'm fine.

23:30.823 --> 23:32.652
Okay, grab these and help me
set the table,

23:32.756 --> 23:34.896
'cause Jimmy should
be here any minute.

23:39.245 --> 23:43.318
So did you know that Jimmy
and Miss Tanner are a couple?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.837
Yes, I did.

23:46.355 --> 23:48.841
Well, I guess
Clara knows everything.

24:00.922 --> 24:02.130
Look...

24:02.233 --> 24:04.822
I'm sorry
you have to be here.

24:04.926 --> 24:07.618
I know it's not
your ideal Christmas.

24:07.722 --> 24:10.172
I'm just trying to make
the best of it.

24:12.727 --> 24:17.421
If I come off as cold
sometimes, I just...

24:17.525 --> 24:20.044
I don't really like
to let people in.

24:20.148 --> 24:24.393
I'm not very good
with human interaction.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.981
It's okay.

24:26.085 --> 24:28.915
Neither am I, so...

24:29.019 --> 24:31.055
Girls, get changed for dinner!

24:31.159 --> 24:34.231
Okay, Miss Tanner.

25:11.337 --> 25:12.476
He's 27.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.478
He's pretty handsome.

25:14.582 --> 25:17.308
- He sure is.
- So you like him?

25:17.412 --> 25:18.655
Of course I like him.

25:18.758 --> 25:20.449
Yeah,
but do you <i>love</i> him?

25:20.553 --> 25:22.417
Oh, shush.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.488
I don't know. Maybe.

25:24.592 --> 25:26.076
What do you think, Clara?

25:26.179 --> 25:27.560
Sounds like love to me.

25:31.909 --> 25:34.015
Sounds like
Prince Charming's back.

25:34.118 --> 25:36.155
Sounds like Prince Charming
forgot his keys.

25:38.398 --> 25:40.124
Hello, ma'am.
Hmm?

25:40.228 --> 25:44.370
So sorry to bother you,
it being Christmas Eve and all,

25:44.473 --> 25:47.097
but do you mind
if we come in?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.926
My friend here,
he's hurt real bad.

25:49.030 --> 25:51.411
Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry. I'm not
supposed to let anyone in.

25:51.515 --> 25:52.481

- Please.
- Um, why don't you--

25:57.763 --> 25:59.212
I'll-- I'll call for help
for you,

25:59.316 --> 26:00.662
and you can wait out here.

26:00.766 --> 26:04.114
Hey.
That's not a good idea.

26:04.217 --> 26:06.012
Check the kitchen.

26:06.116 --> 26:10.223
If I remember, there's
a first aid kit behind the door.

26:10.327 --> 26:12.467
Just a bandage and some alcohol
- would help so much.
- What?

26:12.571 --> 26:15.401
- How did you know that?
- Class of '64.

26:15.504 --> 26:18.887
My picture's on the wall
over there.

26:18.991 --> 26:22.753
Come on.
Help us out here.

26:22.857 --> 26:24.652
Blackvale girls
are supposed to look out

26:24.755 --> 26:27.275
for each other, right?

26:27.378 --> 26:29.518
- That's right.
- Yeah.

26:40.529 --> 26:41.945
Aah!

26:43.671 --> 26:44.568
Still the same.

26:47.019 --> 26:50.367
I guess some things
never change, huh?

26:50.470 --> 26:51.506
What are your names?

26:56.787 --> 27:00.446
I'm Samantha.
This is Clara.

27:00.549 --> 27:02.103
And that's Miss Tanner.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.484

27:04.588 --> 27:06.555
Rose.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.247
Rose.

27:08.350 --> 27:09.558
How pretty.

27:11.837 --> 27:15.806
Hey, you look familiar.

27:15.910 --> 27:19.051
You have an older sister
or something?

27:19.154 --> 27:20.569
What happened?

27:20.673 --> 27:23.607
I got shot.

27:23.711 --> 27:27.024
Why were you shot?

27:27.128 --> 27:28.647
I don't know.

27:28.750 --> 27:31.028
'Cause you'd have to ask
the person who shot me.

27:33.203 --> 27:37.207
Well, there's--
there's no entry hole and...

27:37.310 --> 27:38.691
it just scraped the skin.

27:38.795 --> 27:40.451
That's what I said.

27:40.555 --> 27:42.039
He wanted
to go to a hospital.

27:42.143 --> 27:44.076
I said,
"You don't need a hospital.

27:44.179 --> 27:46.837
You just need a nice lady
with a first aid kit."

27:46.941 --> 27:51.324
There was so much blood.

27:51.428 --> 27:56.260
It smells good in here.
Christmas dinner?

27:56.364 --> 28:00.333
I am so sorry.
We can't invite you to stay.

28:00.437 --> 28:04.096
We don't need an invitation.
Nothing fancy like that for us.

28:06.305 --> 28:09.239
This place is so much
nicer than the one in Somerset.

28:09.342 --> 28:11.517
The other one had
small-town charm,

28:11.620 --> 28:16.798
but this one
is far more elegant.

28:18.351 --> 28:21.078
Wow.
That turkey looks mighty fine.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.876
And mashed potatoes.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.914
I could certainly go
for some of those.

28:29.017 --> 28:30.398
You girls
like mashed potatoes?

28:30.501 --> 28:33.194
That's enough.
Your friend is bandaged up.

28:33.297 --> 28:34.505
Good as new.

28:34.609 --> 28:36.024

to get out of here.

29:57.036 --> 29:58.589

34:43.840 --> 34:45.462
- Wine? Okay.
- Mm. Thank you.

34:45.566 --> 34:47.015
The headmaster
still a sour old bitch?

34:47.119 --> 34:50.467
That's pretty good.

34:50.571 --> 34:52.607
What dorms are you in?
I was in the south dorm.

34:52.711 --> 34:53.712
Ahh!

35:00.339 --> 35:02.617
Great biscuit.

35:02.721 --> 35:05.620
And good gravy.

35:05.724 --> 35:06.656
No lumps.

35:10.038 --> 35:11.764
- You like it, Grant?
- Oh, yeah.

35:11.868 --> 35:13.870
I don't know why you thought

35:13.973 --> 35:17.701
that you wouldn't have enough
food for everyone, Rose.

35:17.805 --> 35:19.841
There's plenty here.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.469
You should really try some.

35:26.572 --> 35:29.679
Yeah,
you should try it.

35:32.682 --> 35:34.649
Ahh!

35:46.972 --> 35:48.525
Here.

35:50.665 --> 35:52.011
Eat it.

35:54.428 --> 35:56.119
Untie me, and I will.

35:56.223 --> 35:58.777
Oh, there's no need.
You can reach.

36:00.330 --> 36:02.436
No.
Don't do it.

36:05.163 --> 36:09.132
Come on, Rose.
They're delicious.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.864
No.

36:19.729 --> 36:21.765
I think she needs help.

36:37.850 --> 36:39.749
See?

36:39.852 --> 36:41.302
Wasn't that good?

36:41.406 --> 36:44.995
You did such a lovely job.

36:49.448 --> 36:51.830
Get out of here,
you murderers!

36:51.933 --> 36:53.625
I know who you are.

36:53.728 --> 36:55.558
You killed those people,
and the police...

36:55.661 --> 36:58.733
the police are coming for you,
and they're gonna get you.

36:58.837 --> 37:02.150
Oh, no. The police
are coming to get us.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.531
Oh, no.

37:03.635 --> 37:06.465
Tell me something, Rosie.

37:06.569 --> 37:08.053
Doug,
can you clean her up?

37:08.156 --> 37:09.572
I can't look at her.

37:09.675 --> 37:10.435
Why do I got to?

37:10.538 --> 37:12.437
Just do it, Doug.

37:14.577 --> 37:17.683
Take valuable time.

37:17.787 --> 37:21.169
There.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.964
There.

37:23.068 --> 37:24.863
There.

37:24.966 --> 37:26.830
Spick-and-fucking span.

37:26.934 --> 37:28.763
Thanks.

37:28.867 --> 37:31.525
Now, tell me something.

37:31.628 --> 37:33.872
Do you love your boyfriend?

37:33.975 --> 37:35.149
What?

37:37.082 --> 37:39.602
Do you love him?

37:41.569 --> 37:42.639
Yes.

37:42.743 --> 37:45.470
Wow! Great.

37:45.573 --> 37:48.266
Because I think he feels
the same way about you.

37:48.369 --> 37:50.509
Maisie, if you'll please.

37:53.892 --> 37:56.343
Make a move, and
I slit your throat.

38:09.148 --> 38:10.046
Oh!

38:10.149 --> 38:11.116
Aww.

38:11.219 --> 38:12.290
No.

38:12.393 --> 38:14.326
My dearest Rose...

38:14.430 --> 38:17.122
I've waited an awfully
long time to do this

38:17.225 --> 38:19.814
because I wanted it
to be special.

38:19.918 --> 38:24.888
And what could be more special
than a night like this?

38:24.992 --> 38:29.583
The greatest gift you can
give me is a single word.

38:31.032 --> 38:33.380
Here.

38:33.483 --> 38:37.901
We can do this
next part together.

38:41.077 --> 38:42.250
You...

38:42.354 --> 38:44.805
Fuck you!

39:01.131 --> 39:03.168
I think she said yes.

39:07.655 --> 39:09.692
Ah! Damn it, Jude!

39:09.795 --> 39:11.832
You got blood
all over the food.

39:11.935 --> 39:14.352
Hey, you've had enough.

39:14.455 --> 39:18.079
You don't want to get chubby
like Grant over there.

39:18.183 --> 39:23.188
Besides, we have so many more
festivities before midnight.

39:23.291 --> 39:25.570
We've got to stay
on schedule.

39:32.715 --> 39:35.096
Here...

39:35.200 --> 39:36.753
wear this.

39:38.479 --> 39:42.345
It's lovely.

39:42.449 --> 39:44.830
He must have saved up
for it.

40:26.113 --> 40:27.114
What's this?

40:30.635 --> 40:32.015
She's been, uh, ahem...

40:32.119 --> 40:33.154
very cooperative.

40:43.993 --> 40:45.546
So...

40:45.650 --> 40:47.134
are you the kinds of people

40:47.237 --> 40:49.377
that like to open your presents
on Christmas Eve

40:49.481 --> 40:51.518
or Christmas Morning?

40:51.621 --> 40:54.900
Eve.
I just can't wait.

40:57.524 --> 40:59.180
Oh, I want this one.

41:00.699 --> 41:02.011
That belongs to Samantha.

41:02.114 --> 41:03.599
Can't you see her name
on the card?

41:03.702 --> 41:05.255
Oh. Of course.

41:05.359 --> 41:07.050
Sorry, Samantha.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.089
"Dear Samantha...

41:11.192 --> 41:13.194
I'm so happy to be
spending the holiday with you.

41:13.298 --> 41:16.059
My apologies. This gift
was a little last minute.

41:16.163 --> 41:17.578
I'd bought this for myself,

41:17.682 --> 41:19.028
but I know you love
the color blue,

41:19.131 --> 41:21.271
and I think it would look
so much better on you.

41:21.375 --> 41:22.721
Rose."

41:22.825 --> 41:24.654
Jude, aren't we
on a schedule here?

41:24.758 --> 41:26.553
There's always time
for presents, Doug.

41:26.656 --> 41:28.486
This is beautiful.

41:28.589 --> 41:29.659
Do you think
it's gonna fit me?

41:29.763 --> 41:31.350
Now, now, Maisie.

41:31.454 --> 41:33.042
Give it to Samantha.

41:33.145 --> 41:36.114
It belongs to her.
She should wear it.

41:40.705 --> 41:43.535
Don't try anything funny
now that your hands are free.

41:46.124 --> 41:47.677
Go ahead, sweetie.

41:47.781 --> 41:49.852
Put the dress on.

41:49.955 --> 41:54.235
We need to make sure
it fits right, don't we, Rosie?

41:54.339 --> 41:56.375
I can't
with everyone watching.

41:56.479 --> 41:57.756
Nonsense.

41:57.860 --> 41:59.344
We're all friends here.

41:59.447 --> 42:01.173
Mm-hmm.

42:01.277 --> 42:03.382
I can't.[Sighs] Clara...

42:03.486 --> 42:05.971
go stand
in front of your friend.

42:06.075 --> 42:09.561
Let her have some privacy,
if that's what she needs.

42:09.665 --> 42:10.597
Come on!

42:10.700 --> 42:13.047
Let's go. Let's go.

42:52.293 --> 42:53.294
Ah.

43:00.336 --> 43:03.063
How beautiful.

43:03.166 --> 43:04.858
Okay, who's up next?

43:04.961 --> 43:06.411
Ahh.

43:09.172 --> 43:11.381
"Merry Christmas."

43:11.485 --> 43:14.281
"Dear Jimmy..."

43:16.007 --> 43:17.871
Guess we don't
need this anymore.

43:17.974 --> 43:20.114
Here, Grant.
You can have it.

43:24.705 --> 43:27.052
It's a necktie.

43:27.156 --> 43:29.468
How perfect.
- This one is for you.

43:29.572 --> 43:32.230
Oh, thank you.
You shouldn't have.

43:32.333 --> 43:37.753
"Dear Clara, I know you're eager
to see the world someday.

43:37.856 --> 43:41.653
I'm sure you'll have
many wonderful adventures.

43:41.757 --> 43:43.793
Rose." Hmm.

43:43.897 --> 43:45.588
Oh, a travel book.

43:54.252 --> 43:55.840
You're not missing much.

43:57.151 --> 43:58.152
Thank you, Rose.

43:58.256 --> 44:00.327
Mm, it's almost midnight!

44:00.430 --> 44:02.501
Time for our presents.

44:02.605 --> 44:06.367
The party has just begun.

44:06.471 --> 44:09.716
It's gonna be the best
Christmas of your lives...

44:09.819 --> 44:11.787
and likely the last,

44:11.890 --> 44:14.686
so let's make it
really count.

44:14.790 --> 44:16.930
Maisie, give me a hand.

44:17.033 --> 44:19.449
Hold on.

44:19.553 --> 44:22.314
Fire. Music.

44:23.626 --> 44:24.627
Ahh.

44:27.388 --> 44:29.459
What do we got here?

44:41.471 --> 44:43.922
See?
It's like I told you.

44:44.026 --> 44:45.199
They fit together
like a puzzle.

44:45.303 --> 44:46.545
Mm-hmm.

44:52.793 --> 44:57.522
If you get the chance,
get to the guard booth.

44:57.625 --> 44:59.110
It's dead head here,
but there's--

44:59.213 --> 45:01.560
there's a separate line
at the guard booth. Okay?

45:01.664 --> 45:03.770
We're gonna get out
of here.

45:15.022 --> 45:17.335
Let me tell you a story.

45:17.438 --> 45:20.510
Yeah?

45:20.614 --> 45:23.306
My daddy was a preacher.

45:23.410 --> 45:24.860
You wouldn't know it
to look at me now,

45:24.963 --> 45:27.517
but I grew up
in the church.

45:27.621 --> 45:31.107
Every Sunday, there I was down
on my knees, hands together,

45:31.211 --> 45:34.283
watching my daddy
as he preached.

45:34.386 --> 45:37.424
"Praise the Lord!"

45:37.527 --> 45:41.393
Every eye in the house
on him,

45:41.497 --> 45:46.951
waiting on his every word
to deliver hope and salvation.

45:47.054 --> 45:50.299
Now, the simple people
of Greenwood

45:50.402 --> 45:51.990
came to my daddy's church,

45:52.094 --> 45:55.753
and they prayed hard.

45:55.856 --> 45:58.997
"Please, don't let them
close the factory, God."

45:59.101 --> 46:01.482
"Don't let them
draft my only son."

46:01.586 --> 46:03.657
"Don't let this cancer
kill me."

46:03.761 --> 46:06.004
But most of them,

46:06.108 --> 46:08.662
their prayers
went unanswered.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.215
Factories closed.

46:10.319 --> 46:14.841
Young men went to war,
and old men died.

46:14.944 --> 46:16.670
I know what you're thinking--

46:16.774 --> 46:19.638
Maybe there is no God.

46:19.742 --> 46:21.951
But you know what?

46:22.055 --> 46:26.162
I don't think that's true.
I think he's real.

46:26.266 --> 46:31.271
The only problem is,
he doesn't give a fuck.

46:31.374 --> 46:33.687
He's not listening.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.690
It's not prayers
that get God's attention.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.175
Oh, no.

46:39.279 --> 46:41.902
It's sacrifice.

46:42.006 --> 46:46.217
The universe
runs on sacrifice.

46:46.320 --> 46:50.393
The powerful sacrifice
the weak and innocent

46:50.497 --> 46:53.983
every day to gods or devils

46:54.087 --> 46:56.814
and get rewarded for it.

46:59.264 --> 47:02.820
And now it's <i>our</i> turn.

47:02.923 --> 47:07.617
Tell them, Maisie.
They're part of it now.

47:07.721 --> 47:09.343
They deserve to know.

47:09.447 --> 47:11.414
There's something special
about this place,

47:11.518 --> 47:14.935
tracing back to the old days
before it was a school.

47:15.039 --> 47:17.179
When I was a Blackvale girl,

47:17.282 --> 47:18.766
not much older
than the two of you,

47:18.870 --> 47:20.872
I found a book of magic.

47:20.976 --> 47:22.978
Real magic. Blood magic.

47:23.081 --> 47:26.153
And when they saw what I was
up to, they kicked me out,

47:26.257 --> 47:29.122
but not before
I could grab this.

47:32.297 --> 47:33.712
Hm.

47:35.991 --> 47:37.993
"The Demon Rite."

47:38.096 --> 47:40.581
We followed this
to the letter.

47:40.685 --> 47:42.135
Every murder,
every drop of blood

47:42.238 --> 47:44.965
brought us
one step closer.

47:45.069 --> 47:47.968
Brought us here--
back to Blackvale.

47:48.072 --> 47:49.383
- Mm, mm, mm.
Where, tonight,

47:49.487 --> 47:53.146
we can finish the ritual,
bring him forth.

47:53.249 --> 47:57.460
A demon who will grant us
unimaginable power.

47:57.564 --> 48:00.291
All we needed
was Maisie's knowledge,

48:00.394 --> 48:05.123
Grant's muscle,
and my vision.

48:05.227 --> 48:07.229
Oh, and Doug's car.

48:07.332 --> 48:09.058
He's got a really nice car.

48:09.162 --> 48:11.405
Oh, wow. Real nice.
Thanks, Jude.

48:11.509 --> 48:14.650
Oh, and, of course,
your sacrifice.

48:14.753 --> 48:17.653
<i>Sanguinem innocentius--</i>

48:17.756 --> 48:20.345
the blood of the innocent.

48:20.449 --> 48:23.107
We only need one of you
to complete the ritual.

48:23.210 --> 48:25.592
But don't get your hopes up.

48:25.695 --> 48:27.766
We're still gonna
kill you all.

48:27.870 --> 48:30.390
You're insane.

48:30.493 --> 48:32.702
What? What was that?

48:32.806 --> 48:34.981
You're insane!

48:35.084 --> 48:37.259
You're murdering people

48:37.362 --> 48:41.056
because of-- of some fairy tale
you found in some book?

48:41.159 --> 48:43.506
Just please, please.

48:43.610 --> 48:44.956
Please just let...

48:45.060 --> 48:47.096
Let them go.
They're just girls.

48:47.200 --> 48:49.961
They don't-- They don't need
to be involved in this.

48:50.065 --> 48:54.310
I don't think you know
how this works, Rosie.

48:54.414 --> 48:57.451
That's exactly why they need
to be involved.

48:57.555 --> 48:58.970
Yeah.
The blood of the innocent.

48:59.074 --> 49:01.248
That's the kind of thing
that demons love.

49:01.352 --> 49:03.768
They practically dine
on little girls like you.

49:03.871 --> 49:06.564
But then again,

49:06.667 --> 49:10.188
what could be more innocent

49:10.292 --> 49:12.639
than a sweet little
schoolteacher?

49:22.235 --> 49:23.753
We got a feisty one!

49:45.016 --> 49:46.776
No!
Ciroc...

49:46.880 --> 49:49.020
king of hell...

49:49.124 --> 49:52.679
Feast on this lamb of God!

49:52.782 --> 49:54.301
No!

50:10.869 --> 50:12.871
Aah!

50:56.087 --> 50:59.539
So... what now?

51:02.128 --> 51:03.819
Is the demon here?

51:08.237 --> 51:10.964
Hello, demon?

51:11.068 --> 51:13.587
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

51:13.691 --> 51:15.624
Maisie?

51:15.727 --> 51:17.626
Something just happened.
The lights, the fire.

51:17.729 --> 51:18.868
You guys saw that, right?

51:21.354 --> 51:22.838
We did everything
we were supposed to do--

51:22.941 --> 51:24.598
the-- the blood of the innocent,

51:24.702 --> 51:28.223
the sigil,
the-- the skin puzzle.

51:28.326 --> 51:30.880
Just give it a minute.
Hold on.

51:32.848 --> 51:34.677
Maisie...

51:34.781 --> 51:37.404
did we just go on
a murder spree for no reason?

51:37.508 --> 51:39.579
No. The demon is
supposed to show.

51:39.682 --> 51:41.477
Are you just making
this shit up?

51:41.581 --> 51:43.997
Hello?! Did you guys
just see what I saw?

51:44.101 --> 51:45.757
Something happened.

51:45.861 --> 51:48.001
And the sigil inscribed
on all those people--

51:48.105 --> 51:50.521
- Did I make that up, too?
- Wait, wait!

51:50.624 --> 51:52.902
There has to be
something we're missing here.

51:53.006 --> 51:55.042
What did we get wrong?

51:55.146 --> 51:56.216
I don't know.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.529
- Well, think!
- I'm trying to.

52:00.013 --> 52:01.670
Okay, I'll--

52:01.773 --> 52:05.018
I'm gonna find the book.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.502
Okay, let's go.

52:08.884 --> 52:10.748
Watch them.

52:10.851 --> 52:11.852
Wait up.

52:11.956 --> 52:13.785
Ahh...

53:18.505 --> 53:21.405
We have
to get out of here.

53:21.508 --> 53:23.855
They're gonna kill us
if we don't.

53:23.959 --> 53:27.859
Fuck! I'm out.

53:27.963 --> 53:31.000
Grant, help me find
something to drink.

53:34.003 --> 53:36.661
What are you
gonna ask it for?

53:36.765 --> 53:38.249
What?

53:38.353 --> 53:39.423
The demon.

53:39.526 --> 53:41.459
I assume
you're summoning it

53:41.563 --> 53:43.703
because
you want something from it.

53:43.806 --> 53:46.326
None of your business.

53:46.430 --> 53:48.811
What would you ask for, Samantha,

53:48.915 --> 53:50.641
if you could have anything?

53:50.744 --> 53:52.884
'Cause that's how it works, right?

53:52.988 --> 53:55.577
You just wish something,
and then the demon grants it?

53:55.680 --> 53:57.958
Like a genie?

53:59.546 --> 54:01.928
You think it's real, though.

54:02.031 --> 54:03.930
What?!

54:04.033 --> 54:05.621
We've seen the news stories.

54:05.725 --> 54:09.073
You've killed
a lot of people.

54:09.176 --> 54:11.558
It's real.

54:11.662 --> 54:14.078
Maisie has proved it
time and time again.

54:14.181 --> 54:15.942
Is it, though, Grant?

54:16.045 --> 54:18.393
I mean, how do we know?

54:18.496 --> 54:22.051
You know?
How do we really know?

54:22.155 --> 54:26.435
I mean, we're trying to raise
a demon, for Christ's sake.

54:26.539 --> 54:29.300
Just because a bunch
of religious weirdos

54:29.404 --> 54:31.716
get matching tattoos
doesn't make it real.

54:31.820 --> 54:35.237
And, Jesus,
I got shot because of it.

54:35.341 --> 54:39.793
I've seen people get shot.

54:39.897 --> 54:41.208
That's barely a scratch.

54:46.731 --> 54:48.733
So...

54:48.837 --> 54:50.701
here we are.

54:53.393 --> 54:55.740
A pretty girl
bats her eyes at me,

54:55.844 --> 54:58.467
says I'll get anything
I want out of it.

54:58.571 --> 55:00.918
And I believed her.

55:01.021 --> 55:03.196
Because you want her.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.267
Maisie?

55:05.371 --> 55:06.855
Of course I want Maisie.

55:06.958 --> 55:10.445
Everybody wants Maisie.
Even this guy wants Maisie.

55:10.548 --> 55:12.792
Don't let the whole
shell-shocked vet thing

55:12.895 --> 55:14.103
throw you.

55:14.207 --> 55:16.968
This guy has killed
for Maisie.

55:17.072 --> 55:20.144
But Jude's in charge?

55:20.247 --> 55:22.974
No, no, no.

55:23.078 --> 55:24.666
He talks the most.

55:24.769 --> 55:28.635
But no, none of us are here
because of Jude.

55:28.739 --> 55:32.121
Maisie's the one
with the nightmares.

55:32.225 --> 55:35.746
Sorry. The <i>visions.</i> Mm.

55:35.849 --> 55:37.541
Maisie's the one
who knew about the book.

55:37.644 --> 55:41.717
About this place.
It's all Maisie.

55:41.821 --> 55:46.170
Jude's just good
at the actual killing.

55:46.273 --> 55:48.862
No offense, Grant.

55:48.966 --> 55:53.004
Grant's a stone-cold killer,
too, but...

55:53.108 --> 55:56.732
Jude's a touch more theatrical
about it.

56:02.945 --> 56:04.499
Maybe it's not
a literal demon.

56:04.602 --> 56:07.087
Maybe
it's a demon force.

56:07.191 --> 56:08.641
Huh?

56:08.744 --> 56:11.057
I feel something.
Do you feel something?

56:13.024 --> 56:17.753
What do you think Maisie
is doing right now with Jude?

56:17.857 --> 56:19.790
Why do you think
they ran off together?

56:22.931 --> 56:25.243
This whole thing
is a fucking joke.

56:27.349 --> 56:30.904
You asked me what I want.
I want Maisie.

56:31.008 --> 56:33.182
But I'm clearly not
any closer to getting her.

56:33.286 --> 56:35.392
Not even with
this fairy-tale,

56:35.495 --> 56:37.739
blood-of-the-innocent
bullshit.

56:37.842 --> 56:41.915
The first time I came
down here was on a dare.

56:42.019 --> 56:43.779
I was only supposed to be down
here for a few minutes,

56:43.883 --> 56:46.713
but then my friends
locked me in.

56:46.817 --> 56:49.854
I was down here
all night by myself.

56:51.373 --> 56:52.512
But that's the night
I found the book,

56:52.616 --> 56:54.825
so who's laughing now?

56:54.928 --> 56:57.897
I can't take this anymore.
I need a drink.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.726
There's got to be
some booze here somewhere.

57:03.592 --> 57:06.146
There's vodka.

57:06.250 --> 57:08.321
In the basement.

57:11.220 --> 57:13.775
Now we're talking.

57:13.878 --> 57:16.122
Watch 'em.

57:29.307 --> 57:30.999
Now what?

57:35.244 --> 57:36.936
I hope
it's still here.

57:48.568 --> 57:50.674
What year were you again?

57:50.777 --> 57:52.641
'64.

57:52.745 --> 57:55.195
'64.

57:58.060 --> 57:59.752
There we go.

58:05.723 --> 58:07.725
Look at all these assholes.

58:07.829 --> 58:09.865
Good thing
you left this school.

58:09.969 --> 58:11.384
That's it.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.834
Perfect.

58:16.734 --> 58:19.185
You should let her go.

58:19.288 --> 58:21.843
She's not what you want.

58:21.946 --> 58:24.121
What do you know
about what I want, kid?

58:28.332 --> 58:30.334
You're not like the others.

58:30.437 --> 58:32.819
You're different.
You're a soldier.

58:32.923 --> 58:34.062
Sit down.

58:34.165 --> 58:35.857
You're going along
with all of this

58:35.960 --> 58:37.410
because you want something.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.136
You need orders.

58:39.239 --> 58:41.034
You need a mission.

58:41.138 --> 58:43.174
I said, "Sit"!

58:51.355 --> 58:55.186
Hell is waiting for you.

59:00.537 --> 59:04.161
Hell is waiting for you.

59:11.582 --> 59:15.275
<i>Hell is waiting for you.</i>

59:18.934 --> 59:22.766
<i>Hell is waiting for you.</i>

59:36.814 --> 59:38.816
You look good
in glasses.

59:41.923 --> 59:45.443
<i>Hell is waiting for you.</i>

01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:04.808
<i>Hell is waiting for you.</i>

01:00:06.672 --> 01:00:10.814
Where the hell
is the basement?

01:00:10.917 --> 01:00:13.230
No.

01:00:13.333 --> 01:00:14.472
No.

01:00:14.576 --> 01:00:16.543
Oh, more hallway. Good.

01:00:22.342 --> 01:00:24.206
I want to show you something.

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.459
What are you doing?

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:16.673
Okay. Stop--

01:01:30.997 --> 01:01:34.380
You should let her go.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:55.712
Yoo-hoo?

01:01:55.815 --> 01:02:00.268
Jude and Maisie?

01:02:00.371 --> 01:02:04.134
We better figure this out
or get the hell out of here.

01:02:07.413 --> 01:02:08.725
Bingo.

01:02:08.828 --> 01:02:11.313
I just...

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:14.696
I can feel him.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.561
The demon we've summoned.

01:02:17.664 --> 01:02:19.943
We're gonna get
everything we wanted.

01:02:20.046 --> 01:02:22.186
All of its power.

01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:24.188
Me and you...

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:27.260
as one.

01:02:29.711 --> 01:02:31.955
Can you feel him,
Maisie?

01:02:32.058 --> 01:02:36.062
Jude.
Jude, you're hurting me.

01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:37.132
You did it.

01:02:37.236 --> 01:02:39.272
We did it.

01:02:39.376 --> 01:02:41.688
You brought him forth.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:44.795
You summoned him.

01:02:44.899 --> 01:02:51.560
Now all we need is
<i>sanguinem nocendium!</i>

01:02:51.664 --> 01:02:55.323
<i>Sanguinem nocendium!</i>

01:02:55.426 --> 01:02:58.498
<i>Sanguinem nocendium!</i>

01:02:58.602 --> 01:03:00.293
Aah!

01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:01.743
Jesus.

01:03:01.847 --> 01:03:06.196
Jesus, Maisie.
What's wrong with you?

01:03:06.299 --> 01:03:08.577
I don't think you're feeling
like yourself, Jude.

01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:14.583
Maybe I'm not.

01:03:14.687 --> 01:03:17.103
But maybe I'm more...

01:03:17.207 --> 01:03:20.900
because
I can feel him.

01:03:21.004 --> 01:03:22.419
Don't you want
to feel him with me?!

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.110
Don't fucking touch me!

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:34.017
You'll see.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.709
Won't be long now.

01:03:57.557 --> 01:03:59.490
Doug.

01:03:59.594 --> 01:04:01.458
Did he hurt you?

01:04:01.561 --> 01:04:03.046
No, I'm fine.

01:04:03.149 --> 01:04:05.634
I-I wasn't watching.
I was just...

01:04:05.738 --> 01:04:09.397
Well, I-I was just
looking for you.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.295
What did he say?

01:04:11.399 --> 01:04:13.194
<i>Sanguinem...</i>

01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:18.337
This is...

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.511
There's more.

01:04:20.615 --> 01:04:23.583
"Blood of the guilty."

01:04:23.687 --> 01:04:25.965
Blood of the what?

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:28.071
Let's go, Clara.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.420
No, no.
I'll stay and keep them busy.

01:04:32.523 --> 01:04:34.146
Don't be crazy.

01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:36.044
We can make out together.

01:04:36.148 --> 01:04:37.321
Come here.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.155
I just don't understand.

01:04:45.467 --> 01:04:47.814
If you don't go now...

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:49.299
you'll die.

01:05:07.006 --> 01:05:10.354
Where are you?

01:05:20.675 --> 01:05:21.848
Where are you?

01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:25.438
Where are you?

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:33.274
<i>Hell is waiting for you.</i>

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:46.321
It's the blood
of our other victims.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:50.256
You've seen a lot of blood,
haven't you?

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.433
We kill people,
like they say on the news.

01:05:55.779 --> 01:05:57.746
Yes.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.679
But what about before?

01:05:59.783 --> 01:06:02.475
Over there.

01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:05.271
Over there, too.

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:08.965
When they shoot, we shoot.

01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:13.314
Somebody dies.
That's the job.

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:16.006
But it isn't just a job,
is it?

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:20.390
When you're out there,
in the jungle,

01:06:20.493 --> 01:06:23.289
far from home...

01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:25.429
knowing
that a Vietcong soldier

01:06:25.533 --> 01:06:29.088
might already have you
lined up in his sights.

01:06:32.574 --> 01:06:38.235
They think you're just a big,
dumb killing machine.

01:06:38.339 --> 01:06:41.031
How did you end up
with them anyway?

01:06:41.135 --> 01:06:43.309
You had friends
in your platoon.

01:06:43.413 --> 01:06:44.552
Brothers.

01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:46.795
Where are they?

01:06:48.832 --> 01:06:52.215
Gone.

01:06:52.318 --> 01:06:56.219
It was a massacre.

01:06:56.322 --> 01:06:58.600
We walked right into it.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.157
I just...

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:08.265
I kept shooting,
but they kept coming.

01:07:08.369 --> 01:07:11.958
I didn't know what to do, so...

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:16.825
I hid under a pile of bodies
until the shooting stopped.

01:07:16.929 --> 01:07:18.793
They all died.

01:07:18.896 --> 01:07:20.657
You didn't.

01:07:23.522 --> 01:07:27.146
I should have.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:28.837
Instead, they gave me
a medal.

01:07:31.806 --> 01:07:36.052
Sole survivor.

01:07:36.155 --> 01:07:38.985
What a joke.

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:41.919
You wish...

01:07:42.023 --> 01:07:45.337
You wish you hadn't
let them all down.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.962
You wish you could
have saved them.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.447
Yes.

01:07:52.551 --> 01:07:54.035
Or died trying.

01:07:55.899 --> 01:07:57.694
Yes.

01:08:00.628 --> 01:08:03.424
<i>It's not too late
to get your wish.</i>

01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:10.086
<i>But first, I have one
last mission for you.</i>

01:08:16.713 --> 01:08:18.887
<i>Soldier...</i>

01:08:18.991 --> 01:08:22.891
<i>killer...</i>

01:08:22.995 --> 01:08:24.686
<i>sole survivor...</i>

01:08:31.348 --> 01:08:33.626
<i>...death has marked you.</i>

01:08:43.774 --> 01:08:45.811
Want to make it permanent?

01:08:56.649 --> 01:09:00.791
Where are you, Ciroc?

01:09:00.895 --> 01:09:03.173
Show yourself.

01:09:03.277 --> 01:09:05.762
We did the things.

01:09:05.865 --> 01:09:10.007
We did everything you asked.
We killed the people.

01:09:10.111 --> 01:09:13.252
We came to the place.
Everything you showed Maisie.

01:09:15.668 --> 01:09:20.086
I know you're here.
I can feel you.

01:09:22.641 --> 01:09:25.402
It's time to reveal yourself.

01:09:25.506 --> 01:09:28.474
Don't fuck with me!

01:09:47.286 --> 01:09:48.736
Insane.

01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:50.186
We did it wrong.

01:09:50.289 --> 01:09:51.773
Fuck.
It all happened so fast.

01:09:51.877 --> 01:09:53.465
And I-I wanted to grab
this whole book,

01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:55.984
- but they caught me.
- Wrong? How?

01:09:58.504 --> 01:10:00.265
It wasn't
a summoning ritual.

01:10:02.336 --> 01:10:04.476
It was an <i>unbinding</i> one.

01:10:04.579 --> 01:10:06.132
Meaning?

01:10:11.483 --> 01:10:14.762
We thought we came here
to summon the demon.

01:10:14.865 --> 01:10:16.867
Yeah?

01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:19.456
But it's been here
all along.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.976
And it lured us here.

01:10:22.079 --> 01:10:23.771
We set it free.

01:10:25.497 --> 01:10:29.363

Let's go!

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:12.647
Everything you required,
we did.

01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:15.616
Ciroc!

01:11:15.719 --> 01:11:17.687
You owe us.

01:11:20.448 --> 01:11:24.556
You owe <i>me!</i>

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:28.180
Where are you?!

01:11:33.461 --> 01:11:36.947
Where are you?

01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:38.742
Where...

01:11:42.125 --> 01:11:44.265
...are you?

01:11:47.993 --> 01:11:50.858
Are you...

01:11:50.961 --> 01:11:53.170
Am I...

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.590
Yes.

01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:02.525
Yes.

01:12:02.628 --> 01:12:05.804
Where else would it be?

01:12:05.907 --> 01:12:07.288
<i>I'm</i> the vessel.

I am the vessel.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:21.129
The power is in me.

01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:26.272

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:28.033

<i>♪ Na-na-na, na-na-na ♪</i>

01:12:48.916 --> 01:12:52.126

I am the vessel!

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:58.857
Okay, so...

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.341
the demon is here.

01:13:00.445 --> 01:13:02.895
Like, it's invisible.

01:13:02.999 --> 01:13:06.140
I always thought a demon needed
to take some kind of form,

01:13:06.243 --> 01:13:08.729
take over your body.

01:13:08.832 --> 01:13:11.456
I don't know.

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:14.528
Oh, I wish you'd known a bit
more before we embarked

01:13:14.631 --> 01:13:17.116
on this little project
of yours.

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.568
Anyway...

01:13:20.672 --> 01:13:26.056
if-- if it's wanting to be
set free,

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.610
then it's not free, right?

01:13:27.713 --> 01:13:31.130
Like, it's...
stuck here?

01:13:34.479 --> 01:13:36.342
What?

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:37.965
What?

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:48.769
No way.

01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:51.047
Come with me.

01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:53.187
Okay.

01:14:05.993 --> 01:14:07.719
Hold this.

01:14:17.867 --> 01:14:19.938
I knew
she looked familiar.

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:22.423
The sister?

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.157
I think we should go.
Should we go?

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.399
Yeah.

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:36.402
What do you mean?

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:39.060
Where are you going?

01:14:39.164 --> 01:14:40.303
We're not done here.

01:14:40.406 --> 01:14:43.099
We're just getting started.

01:14:43.202 --> 01:14:45.550
Jude, did you...

01:14:45.653 --> 01:14:46.689
Are you okay?

01:14:46.792 --> 01:14:48.345
Ah, never better, baby.

01:14:48.449 --> 01:14:50.071
Hey.
We figured it out.

01:14:50.175 --> 01:14:51.176
Clara's the demon.

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:52.867
What?
The girl, Clara.

01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:54.006
She's the demon.

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:55.145
Clara's not the demon.

01:14:55.249 --> 01:14:56.319
<i>I'm</i> the demon.

01:14:56.422 --> 01:14:57.527
No, you've lost your mind.

01:14:57.631 --> 01:14:59.080
Look.
She's in every photo.

01:14:59.184 --> 01:15:00.806
She's as old as the school.
She's clearly the demon.

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.671
Oh!
I see what's going on here.

01:15:03.775 --> 01:15:06.087
I step away for a minute
to clear my head.

01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:09.159
And now you two are buddy-buddy,
playing detective,

01:15:09.263 --> 01:15:10.713
solving the case of the demon

01:15:10.816 --> 01:15:13.025
at
the Blackvale School for Girls.

01:15:13.129 --> 01:15:15.580
Nancy fucking Drew over here
and her dog,

01:15:15.683 --> 01:15:17.305
Toto, too.

01:15:17.409 --> 01:15:18.617
Hey, back the hell off.

01:15:18.721 --> 01:15:21.965
Oh, dog. Doggy.

01:15:22.069 --> 01:15:24.071
You think she gives a shit
about you?

01:15:24.174 --> 01:15:25.279
Jude.

01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:28.282
Oh! Ah!

01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:29.628
Fuck.

01:15:29.732 --> 01:15:31.768
Ah,
that actually fucking hurt.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.115
Guys!

01:15:37.981 --> 01:15:40.328
Jude, stop.

01:15:40.432 --> 01:15:43.228
Your time's up, Dougie boy.

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:45.126
It's all coming to an end.

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:46.403
Yeah!
Aah!

01:16:00.348 --> 01:16:02.868
You figured it all out.

01:16:02.972 --> 01:16:03.973
Good for you.

01:16:04.076 --> 01:16:06.320
But you can't leave now, Maisie.

01:16:06.423 --> 01:16:10.842
We're gathering the guests
for my going-away party.

01:16:12.913 --> 01:16:14.984
Let me out of here.

01:16:15.087 --> 01:16:17.918
Hey,
get the fuck away from me!

01:17:02.963 --> 01:17:04.516
Aah! Aah!

01:17:16.079 --> 01:17:18.392
Yes.

01:17:18.495 --> 01:17:20.463
Operator.
Hi!

01:17:20.566 --> 01:17:22.016
I need the police.
One moment.

01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:25.088
Hi.
What's the emergency?

01:17:25.192 --> 01:17:26.538
Yeah, hi.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.264
Yes.

01:17:28.367 --> 01:17:30.335
I'm at the Blackvale School
- for Girls.
- Okay.

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:32.578
And the Killers...

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:34.097
the Christmas Killers,
they're here.

01:17:34.201 --> 01:17:36.134
Slow down.
Is this some kind of prank call?

01:17:36.237 --> 01:17:39.862
No, this isn't a joke.

01:17:39.965 --> 01:17:42.727
- They've killed people.
- Who have they killed?

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:46.489
My teacher
and the security guard.

01:17:46.592 --> 01:17:48.077
Where are they now?

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.079
They're
in the main building.

01:17:50.182 --> 01:17:51.874
And my friend is trapped
in there, too.

01:17:51.977 --> 01:17:54.117
Uh-huh.
And where are you?

01:17:54.221 --> 01:17:56.879
I'm at the security booth
by the main entrance.

01:17:56.982 --> 01:17:58.846
Okay. Stay calm.
What's your name?

01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:02.022
My name is Samantha.
Samantha Kramer.

01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:03.748
Samantha.

01:18:03.851 --> 01:18:05.404
No, they don't know
I got out.

01:18:05.508 --> 01:18:06.751
Hang on there.

01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:09.236
But what about Clara?

01:18:09.339 --> 01:18:11.963
They're gonna kill her.

01:18:12.066 --> 01:18:13.896
I think they're doing
some sort of ceremony.

01:18:13.999 --> 01:18:15.725
Stay put
till we get there.

01:18:15.829 --> 01:18:18.348
Okay. Hurry.

01:18:18.452 --> 01:18:21.179
Please hurry.

01:18:38.127 --> 01:18:41.544
Blackvale girls look out
for each other.

01:18:47.446 --> 01:18:48.585
Fuck.

01:18:59.079 --> 01:19:00.528
Let us out of here.

01:19:00.632 --> 01:19:02.772
Grant! Come on, buddy.

01:19:02.876 --> 01:19:04.291
Let us out.

01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:10.366
Please. Please.
Come on, buddy.

01:19:10.469 --> 01:19:12.333
Let me out.

01:19:18.201 --> 01:19:19.099
Help!

01:19:20.272 --> 01:19:22.171
Somebody help us!

01:19:22.274 --> 01:19:24.311
Help!

01:19:24.414 --> 01:19:26.623
Someone help us!

01:19:26.727 --> 01:19:28.487
- Nobody can hear you.
- What is this?!

01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:30.317
Let us go.

01:19:32.112 --> 01:19:34.700
Come on, buddy.
Let me out.

01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:36.564
What is this?

01:19:36.668 --> 01:19:38.808
You wanted a ceremony.

01:19:38.912 --> 01:19:40.776
Here it is.

01:19:40.879 --> 01:19:42.570
Grant...

01:19:42.674 --> 01:19:44.676
I am the demon.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.126
I command you...

01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:49.543
let us out
right fucking now!

01:19:49.646 --> 01:19:53.478
All right, listen to Jude,
because he's the demon.

01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:56.412
You were right, Jude--

01:19:56.515 --> 01:19:59.070
The strong gain power
when sacrificing the weak.

01:19:59.173 --> 01:20:03.799
And you are very good
at sacrificing the weak.

01:20:03.902 --> 01:20:05.352
I watched you kill
in my name,

01:20:05.455 --> 01:20:07.250
paint my mark in blood
for the world to see,

01:20:07.354 --> 01:20:12.186
and finally you came here to me
to shed the blood

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:15.672
of the innocent
within these very walls.

01:20:15.776 --> 01:20:16.708
Well done.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.399
What are you?

01:20:18.503 --> 01:20:22.576
Something much older
than you could possibly imagine.

01:20:22.679 --> 01:20:26.097
You think these guys
would do anything for you?

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.377
Men feared me, worshiped me,
died for me...

01:20:32.137 --> 01:20:34.208
...until they turned on me.

01:20:34.312 --> 01:20:38.799
The fire that wiped
out the town.

01:20:38.903 --> 01:20:40.387
They were summoning you.

01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:42.354
And then they
changed their minds.

01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:46.324
Didn't understand what
they were getting into, I guess.

01:20:46.427 --> 01:20:50.707
I have been trapped
in this place, in this building,

01:20:50.811 --> 01:20:54.711
in this body
for a very long time.

01:20:54.815 --> 01:20:56.403
They thought
they destroyed me,

01:20:56.506 --> 01:20:59.509
but I made the best
of a bad situation.

01:20:59.613 --> 01:21:03.928
I was weak, but it didn't take
much for me to assume this form,

01:21:04.031 --> 01:21:05.826
to hide in plain sight,

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:09.934
and to cloud
the minds of students, teachers.

01:21:10.037 --> 01:21:14.386
Who pays attention
to the quiet girl in the corner?

01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:16.250
You certainly didn't.

01:21:16.354 --> 01:21:18.080
Did you, Maisie?

01:21:18.183 --> 01:21:20.565
What, you thought you found
that old book by accident?

01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:22.291
You've restored my power.

01:21:22.394 --> 01:21:24.672
I am so grateful.

01:21:24.776 --> 01:21:26.467
But there's one last step.

01:21:26.571 --> 01:21:29.401
One last sacrifice
needed to break their bonds

01:21:29.505 --> 01:21:31.576
and set me free.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.889
The blood of the guilty.

01:21:33.992 --> 01:21:36.477
Guess who that is.

01:21:37.858 --> 01:21:40.136
Us. You...

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.069
You're gonna kill us.

01:21:42.173 --> 01:21:44.037
If I could kill you myself,
you'd have been dead

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.729
the second
you walked through the door.

01:21:46.832 --> 01:21:48.627
No.

01:21:48.731 --> 01:21:53.115
You have to do it
to yourselves or to each other.

01:21:53.218 --> 01:21:55.738
So, who is ready
to make the first sacrifice?

01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:57.809
We can start small.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.604
Mm...

01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:00.743
No.

01:22:00.846 --> 01:22:01.847
Hmm?

01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:03.297
Mm-hmm...

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:06.059
Mm.

01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:10.028
No, no, no, no.
No, no. Grant.

01:22:10.132 --> 01:22:11.823
Grant.
- Grant, what are you doing?

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:12.893
What is your offering?

01:22:12.997 --> 01:22:14.101
Are you kidding me?

01:22:14.205 --> 01:22:15.551
I'm not giving you anything.

01:22:15.654 --> 01:22:17.173
If you don't give on your own,
then we'll have

01:22:17.277 --> 01:22:18.657
to take something
from you as punishment.

01:22:18.761 --> 01:22:21.143
Grant, don't.
Don't do it.

01:22:21.246 --> 01:22:23.110
Jude, make them stop.

01:22:23.214 --> 01:22:25.147
- One last chance.
- Jude!

01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:26.424
Grant, you choose.

01:22:26.527 --> 01:22:28.012
- What are you doing?
- No! Don't--

01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:29.668
- Grant.
- No, no. No, no!

01:22:29.772 --> 01:22:31.015
Stop!
Grant!

01:22:31.118 --> 01:22:32.913
- Dude, stop!
- No, no. No, no.

01:22:33.017 --> 01:22:35.364
Fuck you, Grant!
Fuck you!

01:22:35.467 --> 01:22:36.572
Stop it!

01:22:36.675 --> 01:22:38.091
Stop, Grant, stop!

01:22:38.194 --> 01:22:39.713
Fuck you,
you fucking demon!

01:22:39.816 --> 01:22:40.956
Shit!

01:22:43.717 --> 01:22:45.305
Great.
Who's next?

01:23:06.705 --> 01:23:08.052
Shit.

01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:11.296
- Ah.
- What the fuck?

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.815
Doug's turn.

01:23:12.918 --> 01:23:14.644
Hmm?

01:23:14.748 --> 01:23:18.407
Maisie,
I love you so much.

01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:21.893
I love you so much,
even without the hair.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.757
It's nice.

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:25.828
Shut up, Doug!

01:23:25.931 --> 01:23:29.245
Doug,
ever the hopeless romantic.

01:23:29.349 --> 01:23:30.867
A metaphoric sacrifice--

01:23:30.971 --> 01:23:33.353
so sweet.

01:23:33.456 --> 01:23:35.872
But I was hoping for something
a little more...

01:23:35.976 --> 01:23:37.805
visceral.

01:23:37.909 --> 01:23:40.049
- Grant.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:23:40.153 --> 01:23:43.156
I want to offer blood the way
Grant offered blood.

01:23:43.259 --> 01:23:45.330
Wonderful.
Stick out your hand.

01:23:56.859 --> 01:23:59.344
No! Fuck!

01:23:59.448 --> 01:24:01.036
Fuck! No!

01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:07.111
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:12.944
You cut off my fingers!

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.152
Next.
Fuck you!

01:24:14.256 --> 01:24:15.567
What about <i>our</i> reward?

01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:17.431
You got the blood
of the innocent.

01:24:17.535 --> 01:24:19.088
Aren't we supposed
to get something, too?

01:24:19.192 --> 01:24:21.401
Don't you see, Jude?
You're getting it.

01:24:21.504 --> 01:24:24.162
You fucking
cut off my fingers, man!

01:24:24.266 --> 01:24:25.336
- This is it.
- Fuck you!

01:24:25.439 --> 01:24:27.303
I want power!
Influence! Fame!

01:24:27.407 --> 01:24:29.823
Well, your wish
is my command.

01:24:29.926 --> 01:24:31.687
When the tabloids
find your bodies,

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:36.381
you'll be on the cover of every
newspaper in the entire world.

01:24:36.485 --> 01:24:39.212
You'll be talked about
for generations.

01:24:39.315 --> 01:24:41.352
- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.

01:24:41.455 --> 01:24:42.560
I don't think
Jude's listening.

01:24:42.663 --> 01:24:44.009
Grant, can you get
his attention?

01:24:44.113 --> 01:24:46.771
Grant, you mother...

01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:48.600
Aah!

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:22.772
Fine.
You're right.

01:25:22.876 --> 01:25:26.051
Ever since I found that
damn book, I've been obsessed.

01:25:26.155 --> 01:25:28.571
Even though I knew people
would die, I had to come back.

01:25:28.675 --> 01:25:31.091
And I had--
I had to know if it was real.

01:25:31.195 --> 01:25:32.575
And now you know.

01:25:35.233 --> 01:25:36.752
Clara?

01:25:38.443 --> 01:25:40.100
And...

01:25:40.204 --> 01:25:41.481
And I wish I didn't.

01:25:41.584 --> 01:25:44.415
It's okay.

01:25:44.518 --> 01:25:46.934
And-- And none of you would
be here if it wasn't for me.

01:25:47.038 --> 01:25:48.419
And I'm--
And I'm sorry.

01:25:50.628 --> 01:25:52.802
Touching.

01:25:52.906 --> 01:25:55.219
Also interesting to note that
death doesn't seem to matter

01:25:55.322 --> 01:25:56.461
unless you and your friends

01:25:56.565 --> 01:25:58.739
are the ones
staring down its throat.

01:25:58.843 --> 01:26:02.398
Well, this has been fun,
but it's almost sunrise.

01:26:02.502 --> 01:26:05.160
And, like Jude said,
we're on a schedule.

01:26:05.263 --> 01:26:06.230
- Grant.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:07.990
No, no. Grant. No.

01:26:08.093 --> 01:26:09.750
It's Dougie.
It's your friend.

01:26:09.854 --> 01:26:10.751
No!

01:26:11.925 --> 01:26:13.478
No, Grant, no!

01:26:15.584 --> 01:26:17.137
Aah!

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:30.254
You bastard.

01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:31.703
You killed him.

01:26:31.807 --> 01:26:34.119
He was one of our own.
And you killed him.

01:26:34.223 --> 01:26:36.570
Grant. Grant.
Listen to me.

01:26:36.674 --> 01:26:38.814
You know I've always
been your greatest ally.

01:26:38.917 --> 01:26:40.402
I took you in.

01:26:40.505 --> 01:26:43.681
Don't you dare bring that thing
close to me again.

01:26:43.784 --> 01:26:44.716
I am the vessel.

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.408
Obey the vessel.

01:27:04.771 --> 01:27:06.013
No.

01:27:06.117 --> 01:27:07.877
No, Grant.

01:27:07.981 --> 01:27:10.017
Grant, please.

01:27:11.536 --> 01:27:12.986
Grant, please, please.

01:27:13.089 --> 01:27:16.231
Hey, we--
we can get out of here.

01:27:16.334 --> 01:27:18.405
Just us.

01:27:18.509 --> 01:27:20.718
We can-- We can go anywhere.
We can go anywhere you want.

01:27:20.821 --> 01:27:22.892
We can just get in the car.
We can drive.

01:27:22.996 --> 01:27:25.067
And-- And now that Jude and
Doug are dead, it's just us.

01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:26.655
And we can--
We can really be happy.

01:27:26.758 --> 01:27:28.104
Don't listen to her.
- We'll do whatever we want.

01:27:28.208 --> 01:27:30.866
- You know?
- You have a mission.
Finish it.

01:27:30.969 --> 01:27:32.695
Jude was possessive,
and Doug was jealous.

01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:34.939
She's lying to you.
Lying like she always does.

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:37.182
She's using you.
She doesn't care about you.

01:27:37.286 --> 01:27:39.530
You know what you need to do--
kill her.

01:27:39.633 --> 01:27:40.876
- Serve your purpose.
- You can do whatever you want.

01:27:40.979 --> 01:27:42.740
- Kill her!
- Enough!

01:27:58.031 --> 01:28:00.827
Well, that's disappointing.

01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:04.693
Three down, one to go.

01:28:08.731 --> 01:28:11.251
Um...

01:28:11.355 --> 01:28:13.978
I'm here to save you.

01:28:23.194 --> 01:28:25.748
What is going on
in here?

01:28:44.249 --> 01:28:45.665
She's the demon?

01:29:02.475 --> 01:29:04.097
Clara, stop it.

01:29:24.082 --> 01:29:25.601
How dare you?

01:29:25.705 --> 01:29:29.294
Clara, what is this?
What is going on?

01:29:34.507 --> 01:29:35.991
Are you gonna kill her?

01:29:36.094 --> 01:29:37.786
I can't kill her,
but I can fuck with her.

01:29:37.889 --> 01:29:40.029
Drive her crazy
until she kills herself.

01:29:50.177 --> 01:29:52.594
Clara! Stop it!

01:29:52.697 --> 01:29:56.011
I have waited so long.

01:29:56.114 --> 01:29:57.599
I'm so close.

01:29:57.702 --> 01:29:59.324
And you're ruining it!

01:30:01.672 --> 01:30:03.639
I told you to leave.

01:30:03.743 --> 01:30:06.159
Why didn't you listen
to me?

01:30:06.262 --> 01:30:07.643
Why did you come back?

01:30:07.747 --> 01:30:09.783
Well,
I couldn't just leave you.

01:30:09.887 --> 01:30:11.233
They were
going to kill you.

01:30:11.336 --> 01:30:14.270
Kill me?

01:30:14.374 --> 01:30:19.448
You stupid girl.
I wish they could kill me.

01:30:19.552 --> 01:30:23.383
What your kind has done to me
is something far worse.

01:30:23.487 --> 01:30:24.833
Do you know what it's like

01:30:24.936 --> 01:30:28.768
being stuck here
year after year here?

01:30:28.871 --> 01:30:32.703
I've met millions of versions
of you, Samantha.

01:30:32.806 --> 01:30:35.982
You want to be liked.
You want to fit in.

01:30:36.085 --> 01:30:37.604
It's so pathetic.

01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:41.781
It's so... human.

01:30:49.374 --> 01:30:52.481
But I thought
we were friends.

01:30:52.585 --> 01:30:56.416
We're not friends.
We've never been friends.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.487
You're
a meager little mortal

01:30:58.591 --> 01:31:01.007
with your meager
little mortal concerns.

01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:04.113
So sad.
You're stuck here for Christmas.

01:31:04.217 --> 01:31:06.150
Poor Samantha.

01:31:06.253 --> 01:31:08.980
Try being stuck here forever.

01:31:09.084 --> 01:31:11.189
How do you think I feel?

01:31:22.649 --> 01:31:24.548
No, Clara.

01:31:24.651 --> 01:31:26.929
I care about you.

01:31:27.033 --> 01:31:28.690
You care about me?

01:31:28.793 --> 01:31:31.313
You care about me?!

01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:37.975
Please, let me in.

01:31:50.781 --> 01:31:53.300
Then let me out.

01:32:09.489 --> 01:32:11.249
Oh.

01:33:27.809 --> 01:33:30.363
You actually did it.

01:33:30.466 --> 01:33:32.330
You freed me.

01:33:32.434 --> 01:33:35.057
Yeah, well...

01:33:35.161 --> 01:33:36.611
I heard Blackvale girls
are supposed

01:33:36.714 --> 01:33:38.647
to look out
for each other.

01:33:38.751 --> 01:33:40.062
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:50.072 --> 01:33:53.662
So what are
you gonna do now?

01:33:53.766 --> 01:33:55.422
Are you gonna leave?

01:34:10.748 --> 01:34:12.888
Do you want
to come with me?
