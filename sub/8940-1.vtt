W-O...

00:54.760 --> 00:56.600
R...

00:56.680 --> 00:58.520
K!

00:58.600 --> 01:00.520
Work.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.360
Today we're going to share
what our parents do for...

01:05.440 --> 01:08.280
Work!

01:08.320 --> 01:10.400
My mommy is a doctor.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.720
My daddy is a truck driver.
- My mom's a teacher.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.400
And your dad?
- Mmm. My dad-

01:18.480 --> 01:22.000
He's... a liar.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.720
A- A liar? Oh, I'm sure
you don't mean a liar.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.440
Well, he wears a suit and goes
to court and talks to the judge.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.760
Oh! I see.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.040
You mean he's a lawyer.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.160
Hey, Fletcher.
How'd it go?

01:43.240 --> 01:46.160
Just another victory for the
wrongly accused. - Yeah, right.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.040
Mr. Reede, great job.
Do you want your coat back?

01:49.080 --> 01:51.480
No, I'm sure you'll be
needing it again and again.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.960
Do you have a moment? - I'm late.
It's my day to be with my son.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.840
A couple of reporters want
to talk about your big win.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.880
Yeah? How's my hair?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.800
Fabulous.
You look great.

02:16.480 --> 02:21.280
What time is it? - I am sure your
dad just got held up in court again.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.360
Dad!
- Maximilian!

02:34.680 --> 02:37.760
Hey, how ya doin', creep?

02:37.840 --> 02:39.720
Good.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.160
Me too, except my arm
has been botherin' me.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.440
Oh, no, Dad!
- Oh, yeah.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.280
It's becoming a claw!

02:52.200 --> 02:55.640
Nothing can stop the claw!

02:58.360 --> 03:02.560
Run, boy, run!
Save yourself!

03:02.640 --> 03:05.040
Do the claw to Mom!
Do the claw to Mom!

03:05.120 --> 03:08.560
Uh-oh. You found
the claw's only weakness.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.480
Subzero temperatures!

03:11.560 --> 03:15.040
So, did you have any trouble
finding the place?

03:15.120 --> 03:18.520
Okay, I'm late. I'm sorry.
I ran out of gas.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.720
The gauge is broken.
Rough neighborhood too.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.800
Good thing I was wearin'
neutral gang colors.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.400
I might have had to pull out
my nine and bust a cap.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.600
<i><b>My mind and my money
and my money and my mind</b></i>

03:29.680 --> 03:33.360
They would never hurt you,
Fletcher. You're their lawyer.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.640
That was below the belt.
Keep the gloves up.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.520
Mom, Dad's taking me
to see wrestling!

03:39.600 --> 03:42.360
Oh, Fletcher!
- Oh, Audrey!

03:42.440 --> 03:45.240
Why do you have to take him
to see that stuff? It's very violent.

03:45.320 --> 03:49.720
The boy must grow
to be a warrior.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.680
Who better to guide him
than Rick Rude...

03:51.760 --> 03:55.040
and Randy Macho-man Savage
in the cage of death?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.120
Oh, good!

03:59.240 --> 04:02.800
Jerry, how's it goin'?
- Hey, gipper!

04:02.800 --> 04:05.080
You look like you grow
by the minute!

04:05.160 --> 04:07.880
Fletcher, pleasure to see you.
Hi, honey!

04:07.960 --> 04:10.280
Hi.

04:10.360 --> 04:13.960
Wow. That was a nice image.
Deleted.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.720
I have some more boxes for you.
- Oh, you're an angel.

04:17.800 --> 04:22.440
Boxes? - Remember, I told you a few
weeks ago, Jerry's moving to Boston.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.840
Oh, right! The job, the thing.
What do you do again?

04:26.920 --> 04:30.200
Hospital administrator.
- Right, right!

04:30.280 --> 04:32.120
Well, the boxes
are in my car.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.040
Oh, those can wait.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.960
I made this young man
a promise, didn't I?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.960
Got time to throw a few?
- Sure!

04:39.040 --> 04:41.440
Come on, then!

04:41.480 --> 04:43.840
I forgot the boyfriend was moving.
- Jerry!

04:43.880 --> 04:46.920
His name is Jerry!
And yes, he's moving.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.280
I'm sorry. I hated him less
than your other boyfriends.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.040
It wasn't serious, was it?
- Semiserious, yes.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.720
You guys aren't-
You know-

04:59.240 --> 05:02.000
I have been
dating him for seven months.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.680
What do you think?
- Really? Ooh!

05:04.720 --> 05:07.640
I was hoping after being married
to me you'd have no strength left.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.560
Remember, when we were married, I wasn't
having sex nearly as often as you were.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.960
Ouch! And the ref
takes a point away.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.200
Out!
- Max is gonna miss him.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.160
I'll be here.

05:22.240 --> 05:26.000
Ready? Yeah! Play ball.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.080
Max, come on. We've gotta go.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.960
Dad, are we really going to wrestling?
- Absolutely, Max Factor.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.240
We just have to stop by
the office for one minute.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.240
Excuse me, sir. Any spare change?

05:37.320 --> 05:39.240
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all out.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.280
I can't do it.

05:41.320 --> 05:45.080
Fred, it's your duty to present
the strongest case possible.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.960
The strongest case possible
consistent with the truth.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.960
Will you let the judge
decide what's true?

05:50.040 --> 05:53.640
That's what he gets paid for.
You get paid to win.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.920
If you insist
that I take it to trial,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.560
I will represent Mrs. Cole
aggressively and ethically.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.720
But Miranda, I won't lie.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.640
Then we'll just have
to find someone who will.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.920
Twenty-first floor.
Men's wear.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.320
Hi, Mr. Reede!
- Whoa!

06:17.360 --> 06:21.320
Hey. Did you do something
to your hair?

06:21.360 --> 06:23.120
It's a bit extreme,
isn't it?

06:23.200 --> 06:26.760
No! That's the thing nowadays, right?

06:26.800 --> 06:30.120
He said it would accent my facial
features. - That's what it does!

06:30.160 --> 06:32.840
It completely accents
your facial features.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.120
We're just gonna go
to my office-

06:38.920 --> 06:41.400
Hey, Fletcher.
- Hey, Pete.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.800
You losin' a little weight?
- I don't know. Maybe.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.280
Looks and personality.
A double-threat guy.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.680
Hey, Mr. Reede.
- Hey... man.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.720
It's, uh, Randy.
- Yeah, I know.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.720
Takin' lunch orders.
Anything?

06:53.800 --> 06:55.760
No, thanks.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.120
I had so much for breakfast,
I'm ready to pop.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.280
I mean, I'm full.
- Okay. Great.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.920
Max!
- Hi, Greta.

07:09.960 --> 07:14.520
Hey, what's new? - It's my birthday
tomorrow, and we're having a party.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.800
Wow! I am sure your daddy
has got you something wonderful.

07:17.880 --> 07:23.240
Yeah?
- Yeah, you bet! Listen, kiddo.

07:23.320 --> 07:27.480
Why don't you play in my office
for a minute. Sue somebody for
everything they've got.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.640
Maybe you can send a fax
to one of your girlfriends. Hey, sorry.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.440
Damn it!
I completely forgot.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.400
Oh, what a surprise.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.040
You are a saint.
I should buy you a gift.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.960
You did. - I always do
the classy thing. Any calls?

07:44.040 --> 07:46.920
The Drawlings' clerk needs your filing.
- Tell him it's in the mail.

07:46.960 --> 07:51.720
Right. You'll do it next week. Mr. McKinley
phoned to confirm your meeting tomorrow.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.720
Strep throat. Some kind of virus.
What's goin' around?

07:54.760 --> 07:56.800
Asian flu?
- Good one.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.400
And your mother called.
- I'm on vacation.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.800
It's your fifth week.
- Snowed in. Phones are down.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.200
Break mother's heart.
Done. That's it.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.120
Except Miranda's looking for you.

08:07.200 --> 08:11.560
How much ass do I have to kiss
to make partner?

08:11.600 --> 08:16.040
Tell her I broke my leg and I had to be
shot. - Tell her yourself.

08:16.080 --> 08:20.040
And then send out a notice
of judgement on my win today!

08:20.080 --> 08:25.160
I'll get right on it.
- Miranda! Hey, I didn't see you.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.560
You look beautiful today.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.080
Here! I bought you a gift.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.840
Oh, thanks. I heard about
your victory. Congratulations.

08:33.919 --> 08:37.320
You're making quite an impression
on the partnership committee.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.760
That's right!
You folks are meetin' soon.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.039
I've been so busy,
I haven't even thought about it.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.880
Anyway. I have a client
in my office.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.760
Better not keep him waiting.
- Actually, something rather
important's just come up.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.880
Um, you're not busy tonight, are you?

09:04.720 --> 09:06.800
We're not going, are we?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.920
Audrey. You know how there are
moments you know are critical?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.920
Mm-hmm.
- And choices that have to be made...

09:27.000 --> 09:30.280
upon which all one's
future happiness will depend?

09:30.320 --> 09:32.240
This is one of those moments.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.440
What are you
trying to say?

09:37.480 --> 09:39.840
Will you marry me?

09:43.240 --> 09:47.200
You're moving. - I know, but
l want you and Max to come with me.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.320
Audrey, I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.200
You know I'm not prone to wild
flights of romantic fancy.

09:52.280 --> 09:56.480
But the thought of you and I
together just makes sense.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.280
Now I'm ready. I think
you're ready. I love Max.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.560
You love Max.
It's right. It fits.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.080
So what do you say?

10:21.640 --> 10:25.000
Hey, creepy.
Happy birthday.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.920
How old are you now,
22 or 23?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.320
I'm five, Dad.
- Okay.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.880
Return the beer keg.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.960
Cancel the dancing girls.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.880
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.400
I feel completely unprepared
for this.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.200
You see, I bought you a present,
but last night...

10:44.240 --> 10:47.400
I accidentally swallowed it.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.080
Dad, it's in your belly!
- Scalpel.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.000
I hope it's not
partially digested!

10:53.040 --> 10:55.440
Ooh! Look out!

10:55.520 --> 10:58.080
Cool! What is it?
- Cool!

10:58.120 --> 11:01.680
It's- lt's a surprise.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.600
All right, it's a pony.
Just open it!

11:05.000 --> 11:08.200
I'm gonna help,
'cause I can't stand it!

11:09.680 --> 11:12.880
Baseball stuff!
- Baseball stuff!

11:12.960 --> 11:15.560
Cool! Can we play?

11:15.640 --> 11:19.200
I'll be Nomo. You can be
Jose Canseco. Can we play?

11:19.240 --> 11:21.640
Absolutely.
- Yeah!

11:21.680 --> 11:25.440
Right after your party
tonight, we'll do it.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.040
You and me.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.280
I just have to really
concentrate on this right now.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.720
Hi!

11:55.800 --> 11:58.800
Hey! Happy birthday.

11:58.920 --> 12:02.440
Thanks, Mom.
- Happy birthday, Max!

12:02.440 --> 12:07.000
One, two, three, four, five.
And one for good luck!

12:07.040 --> 12:09.000
He struck the child.
Did you see that?

12:09.080 --> 12:12.480
Look at what Dad got me!
- Whoa! Great!

12:12.520 --> 12:15.400
Hey, I have my glove
in the car.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.720
Maybe we can stop at the park
on the way home and play catch.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.160
Then tonight we can rub oil in it
and wrap a big rubber band around it.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.880
It'll be great.
Hey, great gift, Dad!

12:24.960 --> 12:29.040
Thanks, son. I'm so glad my gift
could bring those two together.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.000
My plan to phase myself out
is almost complete.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.360
Something's come up,
and we need to talk.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.600
Come on, Mom.
I want to go play!

12:37.680 --> 12:40.680
And actually it's kind of important,
so maybe we could talk tonight?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.760
Tonight?
- Yes.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.760
Max's birthday party.
- Oh! Yeah.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.200
Sure. Of course.
We'll talk then. Great!

12:50.800 --> 12:53.400
Maximus! I'm outta here.
- Bye, Dad.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.760
Jerry, enjoy my wife.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.480
Well, this is good.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.840
This is really smart.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.760
Thank you.
- Only-

13:17.800 --> 13:22.160
Well, it's not true.
Does that present a problem?

13:23.760 --> 13:25.600
Mrs. Cole,
the only problem here...

13:25.680 --> 13:29.280
is that after you've provided years
of faithful service and loving support,

13:29.320 --> 13:31.440
of raising his children-
they are his?

13:31.520 --> 13:35.560
Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah.
One for sure.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.360
After all that, your husband
wants to deny you...

13:39.400 --> 13:43.600
a fair share of the assets based
on one act of indiscretion. - Seven.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.640
Pardon me?
- Seven single acts of indiscretion.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.640
Seven acts of indiscretion,

13:50.720 --> 13:52.920
only one of which he has
any evidence of...

13:52.960 --> 13:56.400
and all of which he himself
is responsible for.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.600
He is?
- Mrs. Cole.

13:59.680 --> 14:03.360
You're the victim here.
The wife of a cold, distant workaholic.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.960
Starved for affection, driven
into the arms of another man!

14:06.040 --> 14:07.920
Seven.
- Yeah, whatever!

14:08.000 --> 14:10.080
You're not trying to deny him
what is rightfully his.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.480
All you're insisting on is what
is rightfully yours. - Yeah.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.440
And maybe a...
fraction more.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.880
I think you're
bending over backwards.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.640
Yeah. I did offer to
give him joint custody of the kids.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.720
He is, after all,
a wonderful father.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.840
And how does he repay you?

14:29.920 --> 14:32.160
By dragging you through
a painful litigation process!

14:32.200 --> 14:35.680
No, no, no, no!
This can't happen!

14:35.760 --> 14:39.320
With all due respect, this isn't
about you and Mr. Cole anymore.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.280
This is about all women.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.640
Where would Tina Turner be right
now if she'd rolled over and said,

14:44.680 --> 14:47.840
<i><b>Hit me again, lke,
and put some stank on it?</b></i>

14:47.880 --> 14:49.960
Rollin' on the river,
that's where she'd be.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.920
But she's beyond Thunderdome,
because she decided to send a message.

14:53.960 --> 14:58.680
Wake up, sisters!
There's no-o-o-o-o-o...

14:58.720 --> 15:02.240
such thing as a weaker sex!

15:02.280 --> 15:05.680
You know what?

15:05.760 --> 15:10.240
You're right, Mr. Reede. I am
tired of getting kicked around!

15:10.280 --> 15:12.800
Good for you!

15:12.880 --> 15:16.840
Thank you.
I am so grateful...

15:16.920 --> 15:19.720
to have an attorney
I can trust.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.040
Oh, you are good.

15:28.120 --> 15:32.680
You are very, very good.

15:32.760 --> 15:36.560
The Cole case is worth
a truckload of money to this firm.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.760
If you win, I guarantee
you'll make partner.

15:42.440 --> 15:46.400
In fact, how would you
like to make...

15:46.440 --> 15:48.840
a partner right now, hmm?

15:48.920 --> 15:52.320
Oh, I don't know.
I should-

15:58.560 --> 16:01.120
<i><b>Happy, happy, happy
happy, happy, happy</b></i>

16:01.200 --> 16:05.640
<i><b>Happy
I'm so happy today</b></i>

16:05.720 --> 16:08.960
<i><b>I live in the U. S. A.
- So honey?</b></i>

16:09.040 --> 16:11.360
Have you, uh,
thought about-

16:11.400 --> 16:16.000
You know, what we talked about?
- Uh, yeah. I can't go.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.920
What? Wh-Why not?

16:17.960 --> 16:21.360
Because of Max.
- But he'll love it there.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.400
I'm gonna take him
to Fenway Park.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.360
There's hiking
and camping-

16:25.440 --> 16:29.120
Well, really,
it's... Fletcher.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.840
Fletcher?
Come on, honey.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.080
He wouldn't even come over
unless you reminded him.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.640
I know, but when he does
come over, Max is so happy.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.080
It's like they have their
own little world together.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.880
The gipper and I have that too!
- I know, but it's different.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.480
How?
- Well-

16:46.520 --> 16:48.360
He does the claw.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.240
The what?
- The claw.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.240
You know, it's like this-

16:54.280 --> 16:56.440
I don't-

16:56.480 --> 17:01.120
Run for you life.
It's the claw! The claw!

17:05.760 --> 17:08.000
I can't really do it that good.
That's not the point.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.240
The point is...

17:10.319 --> 17:12.680
if they're 3, 000 miles apart,
they're never gonna see each other.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.599
Fletcher's never gonna
come to Boston.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.079
Hello.

17:18.119 --> 17:21.040
Audrey?
- Fletcher! Where are you?

17:21.119 --> 17:23.359
We're waiting. Max won't cut the cake
until you get here.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.240
Um- Oh, man!

17:26.319 --> 17:28.720
Actually, something
has come up. I've-

17:28.800 --> 17:30.880
I've got this problem
on a new case.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.800
What happened?
- Nothing!

17:32.840 --> 17:35.040
I stubbed my toe
on the desk!

17:35.080 --> 17:38.800
I'm really sorry,
but I just can't make it.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.080
The boss is, uh,
really ridin' me.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.680
Fletcher, it's his birthday!

17:44.760 --> 17:46.600
I know, l know.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.120
I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll
pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.240
You're gonna pick him up?
- Yes!

17:52.320 --> 17:55.080
All right, hold on a minute.
You can say happy birthday.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.440
No! Gotta go! Good-bye.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.840
Hello.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.760
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

18:04.800 --> 18:09.760
<i><b>Happy birthday, dear Max</b></i>

18:09.800 --> 18:14.920
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

18:16.400 --> 18:19.520
Okay, birthday boy.
Make a wish.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.200
Come on, Max.
It can be anything you want.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.280
Anything in the whole world.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.920
Max.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.120
Your father is sorry.
He had to work.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.640
He said he was gonna
be here. He promised.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.880
I know, but he promises that
he is gonna see you tomorrow.

18:53.920 --> 18:57.800
Okay? He's gonna pick you up
from school. All right?

19:00.640 --> 19:04.080
So come on.
Make a wish.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.080
<i><b>I wish that for only one day...</b></i>

19:18.120 --> 19:21.960
<i><b>Dad couldn't tell a lie.</b></i>

19:46.800 --> 19:51.120
Mmm. That was incredible.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.360
Was it good for you?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.480
I've had better.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.400
<i><b>l've had better?</b></i>

20:08.760 --> 20:11.160
<i><b>l've had better?</b></i>

20:15.480 --> 20:17.320
<i><b>l've had better.</b></i>

20:39.920 --> 20:42.240
Hi.
- Hi.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.400
New in the building?
- Yeah, I just moved in Monday.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.560
Oh! You like it so far?
- Everybody's been real nice.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.120
Well, that's because
you have big jugs.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.680
I mean, your boobs
are huge.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.240
I mean, l wanna
squeeze 'em.

20:58.320 --> 21:02.000
Mama.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.400
Any change, mister?
- Absolutely.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.720
Could you spare some?
- Yes, I could.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.240
Will ya? How come?
- Mm-mm.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.720
Because I believe
you will buy booze with it!

21:21.760 --> 21:26.440
I just wanna get to the office
without being confronted by
the decay of Western society!

21:26.520 --> 21:28.680
Plus, I'm cheap!

21:29.720 --> 21:31.600
Jerk off!

22:01.320 --> 22:03.200
You look like you're
having a rough morning.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.920
Ding, ding, ding!
What do we have for her, Johnny?

22:08.240 --> 22:10.520
Fletcher.
- Dana.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.760
All right, Samantha. How much
will it take to put an end to all this?

22:13.840 --> 22:17.760
Fifty percent of your estate.
- Fifty percent?

22:17.840 --> 22:21.080
With a pre-nup and proof of adultery?
What's your case?

22:21.160 --> 22:23.360
Our case is simply this.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.760
Very funny, Fletcher!

23:05.840 --> 23:09.480
You wanna play hardball?
I'm game.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.200
<i><b>You wanna play hardball? I'm game.</b></i>

23:12.280 --> 23:14.840
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

23:14.880 --> 23:19.040
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.040
Honorable?

23:22.160 --> 23:27.440
Good morning.
Call case number BD-09395.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.240
Samantha Cole vs. Richard Cole.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.120
How are we doing this morning,
Counsel? - Fine. Thank you.

23:33.200 --> 23:38.200
And you, Mr. Reede? - I'm a little upset
about a bad sexual episode last night.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.080
Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.440
In the meantime, what do you say
we get down to business?

23:49.520 --> 23:54.040
First, Mr. Reede, I see-
- I would like a continuance!

23:54.080 --> 23:58.120
This case has been delayed
several times, Mr. Reede.

23:58.200 --> 24:03.320
I realize that, Your Honor, but l would
really, really like a continuance.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.920
I'll have to hear
good cause, Counsel.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.840
What's the problem?

24:16.920 --> 24:19.800
I can't lie!

24:19.880 --> 24:24.440
Commendable, Mr. Reede, but I'm waiting
to hear good cause. Do you have one or not?

24:24.480 --> 24:27.520
Not.
- Motion for continuance denied.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.360
Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case?

24:30.440 --> 24:35.160
I don't think so, Your Honor.
My client has already offered
Mrs Cole 2.4 million dollars.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.840
But Mr. Reede has made it clear
he has no desire... - Settle!

24:39.920 --> 24:43.160
Settle, settle, settle, settle!
- I don't want to settle.

24:43.240 --> 24:47.320
Mr. Reede. You convinced me
yesterday, I'm the victim!

24:47.360 --> 24:51.320
I'm starved for affection.
I'm driven into the arms of another man.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.360
Seven!
- Yeah, whatever.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.360
With the story you came up with,
I don't think we can lose.

24:56.440 --> 25:00.600
I want to proceed.
- Mrs. Cole, you don't understand.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.000
Mr. Reede.
Do we have a settlement?

25:03.080 --> 25:04.960
No!

25:09.160 --> 25:11.760
No, Your Honor.
- There's no settlement.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.680
Trial to commence 1:30 sharp.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.680
It was me!

25:38.080 --> 25:40.440
Hi, Mr. Reede!
Like the new dress?

25:40.480 --> 25:45.040
Whatever takes the focus
off your head.

25:45.080 --> 25:49.920
What's up, Fletcher? - Your
cholesterol, fatty! Dead man walkin'.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.120
Hey, Fletcher. - Hey! You're
not important enough to remember.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.000
What's it gonna be, Mr. Reede?
- A pockmark, eventually!

25:55.040 --> 25:58.360
Don't ask!
For God's sakes, don't ask.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.080
All right.
You can beat this.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.920
It's all a matter
of willpower!

26:03.960 --> 26:07.320
A test. Something small.

26:12.840 --> 26:17.360
Red. Red. All right?
Now focus.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.800
The color of this pen
is r-r-r-

26:23.640 --> 26:25.880
The color of this pen...

26:25.960 --> 26:28.760
is re-e-e-e-e-

26:28.800 --> 26:30.800
Re-e-e-e-

26:33.920 --> 26:37.880
The color of the pen
that I hold in my hand...

26:37.920 --> 26:40.760
is r-r-r-r-

26:40.800 --> 26:42.680
r-r-royal blue!

26:46.040 --> 26:48.920
One lie, and I can't say it!

26:50.040 --> 26:51.880
I'll write it.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.280
Write it! Write it,
or I'll break it off!

27:26.480 --> 27:30.360
Agh! No!
Come on! Stop it.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.920
Boss? What happened?

27:47.280 --> 27:50.560
The pen is blue.
The pen is blue!

27:50.640 --> 27:54.160
The goddamn pen is blue!

27:56.600 --> 27:58.400
Mr. Reede, are you all right?

27:58.520 --> 28:02.040
I gotta go home.
- Home? Was the case settled?

28:02.160 --> 28:04.720
No! I have to be
in court at 1:30!

28:04.800 --> 28:09.520
Then how are you going to go home?
- I don't know. I don't know.

28:09.560 --> 28:13.440
Okay. Uh, Mr. Reede,
Reuben and Dunn called.

28:13.520 --> 28:16.000
They need to know where the
Darby settlement offer stands.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.200
I just proposed a settlement
to dick with them!

28:21.440 --> 28:23.520
Dick with them.
Got it.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.600
And your mother called. Are you
still on vacation? - No.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.840
Then you're here?
- Yes.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.240
Thank you for clearing
that up, sir.

28:32.280 --> 28:35.480
And your ex-wife called.
She wants to know when you're
coming to pick up your son.

28:35.560 --> 28:39.680
Oh, I'm such a shit!

28:43.400 --> 28:45.760
Hello.
- Audrey?

28:45.840 --> 28:48.560
Fletcher, hi. Are you still picking
Max up from school today?

28:48.600 --> 28:50.600
Here's the thing.
I really can't!

28:50.640 --> 28:54.400
I had a case l was certain would settle,
and it didn't, and I have to go to court.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.840
Right. - It's true! I really
want to see Max today!

28:57.920 --> 28:59.760
I really do.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.520
Uh-huh, but things just keep coming up
at the last minute.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.520
Yes, but this time it's different.
- I see. How is that?

29:05.560 --> 29:09.360
Now I'm telling the truth.
- And last night you weren't.
Well, what were you doing?

29:09.440 --> 29:12.280
Having sex!

29:12.360 --> 29:15.320
Well, I hope that it was
with someone very special.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.440
No! That's the thing. I don't even
like her, but she's a partner.

29:18.480 --> 29:23.000
I thought l could help my career
by makin' her squeal.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.520
What's wrong with me?

29:29.600 --> 29:31.800
I'm getting what I deserve.
I'm reaping what I sow. I'm-

29:43.040 --> 29:46.160
ls Dad still picking me up?
- No, Max, he's not.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.200
I'm sorry, but l'm gonna
pick you up, okay?

29:50.280 --> 29:52.120
I'll work it out.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.080
I guess my wish
didn't come true.

29:54.160 --> 29:58.840
What wish? - I wished that for just
one day Dad couldn't tell a lie.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.680
Max?

30:09.200 --> 30:13.000
I have something important
to talk to you about, okay?

30:13.040 --> 30:15.240
Okay.
- Okay.

30:22.440 --> 30:26.520
Hello? - Audrey! Let me explain.
Something has happened to me.

30:26.600 --> 30:30.360
Well, something else is about to happen
to you. Max and I are moving to Boston.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.560
What?
- Jerry has asked me to marry him,

30:32.600 --> 30:35.160
and Max and I are going
this weekend to look at houses.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.040
I thought it was semiserious!

30:37.080 --> 30:39.760
It's just been given
a violent shove into serious.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.240
You can't move to Boston;
I'll never see Max!

30:42.320 --> 30:45.600
You'll have the same relationship
you have with him now, won't you?

30:45.680 --> 30:47.360
Where are you?
- I'm going home.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.560
When you get there, just stay there.
I'm comin' over. We have to talk.

30:50.640 --> 30:54.720
Fletcher!
- I'll be right there.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.960
Hey, Mr. Reede-

31:06.080 --> 31:09.080
Fletcher.
- Holy hell!

31:12.920 --> 31:16.080
You can run,
but you can't hide.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.800
What's your problem, schmuck?

31:22.840 --> 31:26.080
I'm an inconsiderate prick!

31:48.200 --> 31:50.040
Oh, shit!

31:54.520 --> 31:56.560
Shit!

32:03.520 --> 32:07.040
You know why I pulled you over? - Depends
on how long you were following me!

32:08.240 --> 32:11.360
Why don't we take it from the top?
- Here goes.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.360
I sped, l followed too closely,
I ran a stop sign,

32:13.440 --> 32:17.280
I almost hit a Chevy, l sped
some more, I failed to yield,

32:17.360 --> 32:21.200
I changed lanes without
signaling while speeding!

32:21.280 --> 32:24.560
Is that all?
- No.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.320
I have unpaid parking tickets.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.200
Be gentle.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.680
Audrey! Wait!

32:41.640 --> 32:45.040
Wait, Audrey. Ooh!
Hold on. Wait!

32:45.080 --> 32:49.240
Wait. I just had an insight
into myself. I'm crazy.

32:49.320 --> 32:52.720
<i><b>You call and say,
Wait, I'll be right over,</b></i>

32:52.800 --> 32:55.280
and here's the crazy part-
I actually wait.

32:55.320 --> 32:59.200
I can explain this.
- I have missed a department meeting.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.160
Did you come in a cab?
- Yes!

33:01.200 --> 33:04.200
Where's your car?

33:04.240 --> 33:07.600
Thank you! I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

33:07.680 --> 33:12.800
I can. $1,654.11.
- How do you sleep at night?

33:16.240 --> 33:19.200
I'm takin' this.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.880
You scratched my car!

33:29.960 --> 33:34.160
Where?
- Right there!

33:35.200 --> 33:38.520
Oh, there.
That was already there.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.520
Why, you!

33:41.560 --> 33:43.440
You liar!

33:44.640 --> 33:46.680
-You know what I'm gonna
do about this? -What?

33:46.760 --> 33:50.360
Nothing! Because if I take you to court,
it'll drain eight hours out of my life,

33:50.440 --> 33:53.920
and you won't show up, and if I got
the judgement, you'd just stiff me anyway!

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
So I'm gonna piss and moan
like an impotent jerk...

33:58.040 --> 34:01.360
and then bend over and
take it up the tailpipe!

34:01.440 --> 34:04.400
You been here before,
haven't ya?

34:04.440 --> 34:07.080
Well, I can't remember
when I've had more fun,

34:07.120 --> 34:09.199
but if you'll excuse me,
I have a class.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.120
Are you marrying this guy
because you're mad at me?

34:11.199 --> 34:13.520
No, I divorced you
because I was mad at you.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.719
Wait. I want to talk about this!
- What do you want to say?

34:16.800 --> 34:19.560
Is this guy right for you?
He is so... not me!

34:19.600 --> 34:24.480
That's one of his best qualities.
- But he's kind of a magoo.

34:24.560 --> 34:28.920
I'm sorry. - You're wrong.
Sometimes maybe he is a little-

34:29.000 --> 34:32.400
Magoo!
- Yes. But since we've been going out-

34:32.440 --> 34:35.360
My God, I'm not having this conversation
with you. - Audrey, you can't go.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.760
This is not fair.
- Fair?

34:37.840 --> 34:42.480
Okay, let's define fair. Last night
a five-year-old boy was crushed...

34:42.560 --> 34:46.040
because his father lied to him
about coming to his birthday party.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.960
Fair?
- Last night-

34:48.040 --> 34:50.840
Was none of my business. None
of my business. - Thank you.

34:50.920 --> 34:54.199
Two years ago, it was my business.
But I don't have to care anymore.

34:54.280 --> 34:57.840
That's the magic of divorce.
But it matters to Max!

34:57.880 --> 35:01.000
Everything you do matters,
and everything you don't do.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.920
All right.
Now let me tell you something.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.840
I'm a bad father!

35:07.880 --> 35:09.720
I mean-

35:14.880 --> 35:17.360
I'm a bad father.

35:18.800 --> 35:23.000
You're not a bad father...
when you show up.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.720
What if I come right after court
and play ball?

35:25.800 --> 35:28.880
Then you and I can talk before
you make any rash decisions!

35:28.920 --> 35:31.120
No, we are leaving tonight.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.800
Please, Audrey.
Give me one more chance.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.160
I'm throwin' myself
on the mercy of the court.

35:36.240 --> 35:41.200
I lost you, but please
don't make me lose Max too.

35:43.400 --> 35:47.160
Give me a chance to be
the father I started out to be.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.920
You're really coming?
- This is ironclad.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.960
This is the mother of all promises.
What time?

35:59.080 --> 36:00.880
Okay, 6:00.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.880
Ten to six.
- All right.

36:03.920 --> 36:07.240
All right. But if I tell
Max that you're coming,

36:07.280 --> 36:10.440
and you don't show up and I have
to see that look on his face-

36:10.480 --> 36:12.800
that heartbreaking look-

36:12.840 --> 36:14.720
we're going to Boston.

36:14.760 --> 36:18.160
If I don't show up,
I'll pack you myself.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.360
I will lovingly wrap your
nicknacks with bubble paper.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.280
I hope so.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.160
Do you know what your son was doing
at 8:15 last night?

36:28.200 --> 36:31.640
He was making a birthday wish
that for just one day...

36:31.720 --> 36:34.560
his father couldn't tell a lie.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.560
Oh, my God!
That's it!

36:42.960 --> 36:45.120
<i><b>l do not like them, Sam I Am.</b></i>

36:45.160 --> 36:47.760
<i><b>l do not like green eggs and ham.</b></i>

36:47.840 --> 36:50.360
<i><b>Would you like them here or there?</b></i>

36:50.440 --> 36:53.120
<i><b>I would not like them-
- Excuse me.</b></i>

36:53.160 --> 36:57.400
Hi. I'm Max's bad father-
Er, I'm his father.

36:57.480 --> 37:01.640
Dad! - Could I borrow him
for just one second?

37:01.680 --> 37:06.120
Monster Max!
- You came to play catch?

37:06.200 --> 37:08.800
I'd like to, but I can't.
I gotta talk to you.

37:08.840 --> 37:13.000
Your mommy told me about that wish
you made last night. It came true, Max.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.960
Really? You mean you have to tell
the truth? - Yes.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.120
No matter what?
- No matter what!

37:18.160 --> 37:21.280
Is wrestling real? - In the Olympics,
yes. On channel 23, no.

37:21.320 --> 37:25.200
Will sitting too close to the TV set make
me go blind? - Not in a million years.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.200
If I keep making this face,
will it get stuck that way?

37:28.280 --> 37:31.160
Uh-uh. In fact some people
make a good living that way.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.880
Now listen, Max.
You've gotta do something for me.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.480
I need you to take back that wish.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.000
So you can lie?
- Yes.

37:42.080 --> 37:45.560
But not to you.
You see, Max,

37:45.640 --> 37:49.720
sometimes grownups need to lie.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.000
It's hard to explain,
but if-

37:54.080 --> 37:57.120
Look, here's a good example.
When your mommy was pregnant with you,

37:57.160 --> 37:59.880
she gained 40 pounds;
there was nothing she wouldn't eat.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.360
And Daddy was scared.
But when she'd ask me, "How do I look?"

38:02.440 --> 38:06.680
l'd say, "Honey, you look great.
You're glowing. "

38:06.760 --> 38:09.400
lf I had told Mommy she looked like
a cow, it would have hurt her feelings.

38:09.480 --> 38:13.040
Understand? - My teacher tells me
real beauty's on the inside.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.360
That's just something
ugly people say.

38:16.400 --> 38:20.120
Max, no one can survive in the adult
world if they have to stick to the truth.

38:20.200 --> 38:24.000
I could lose my case, l could lose
my promotion, I could even lose my job.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.920
Now, I need your help, Max.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.240
Okay.

38:28.320 --> 38:32.360
Okay. Do whatever
you did last night,

38:32.400 --> 38:36.560
only this time,
make it an "unwish."

38:44.600 --> 38:46.440
I did it.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.680
Excellent!

38:48.760 --> 38:51.240
Now, I just need
a little test.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.600
-Did it work?
-Not like l'd hoped. Did you unwish it?

39:12.680 --> 39:15.680
Only-
- What? Only what?

39:15.720 --> 39:19.040
Yesterday, when I wished it,
I really meant it.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.480
This time when I unwished it,
I only did it 'cause you told me to.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.560
All right.
Do it again.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.480
And this time, mean it.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.920
But I can't!
- Why not?

39:29.960 --> 39:33.160
'Cause I don't want you to lie.
- I explained this.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.480
I have to lie.
Everybody lies.

39:36.520 --> 39:39.800
Mommy lies.
Even the wonderful Jerry lies.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.760
But you're the only one
that makes me feel bad.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.480
Max, recess is over.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.680
Come on in!

39:52.400 --> 39:54.280
Mom says we're moving to Boston.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.600
That isn't for sure yet.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.240
She promised we'd talk
about it tonight.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.120
I am comin'!

40:03.200 --> 40:05.360
You believe me,
don't you, Max?

40:06.400 --> 40:09.160
I'll see you later, buddy.

40:18.400 --> 40:22.120
Fletcher. How's it hangin'? - Short,
shriveled and always to the left.

40:26.120 --> 40:29.480
Boss, it's Skull.
He knocked over another A.T.M.

40:29.520 --> 40:33.040
This time at knife-point.
He needs your legal advice.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.560
Stop breakin' the law, asshole!

40:48.160 --> 40:50.000
Boss, are you all right?

40:50.080 --> 40:52.400
My son hates me.

40:53.800 --> 40:58.160
Max loves you.
I've seen you together. You're his hero.

40:58.240 --> 41:01.440
Oh, yeah?

41:01.480 --> 41:04.840
Last night at his birthday
party, he made a wish...

41:04.880 --> 41:08.080
that I wouldn't be able
to lie for one whole day.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.560
Kids.
- It came true.

41:10.600 --> 41:14.120
What?
- Max's wish!

41:14.160 --> 41:16.520
It came true.

41:22.040 --> 41:25.000
Boss, maybe you should
just take a few days off.

41:25.040 --> 41:29.240
Greta! Didn't it seem weird to you that
I kept tellin' the truth all morning?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.160
Well, yeah. But-

41:33.080 --> 41:36.520
What are you saying?
That you are incapable of lying?

41:36.560 --> 41:39.600
That's right!
I am incapable of lying!

41:39.680 --> 41:43.880
Just for today?
- Apparently. 'Til 8:15 tonight.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.920
It's one of those
24-hour curses.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.840
Those are goin' around.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.160
You don't believe me, do you?
- Of course not.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.720
How ironic!

41:53.800 --> 41:57.600
Okay. Ask me something
you think I would normally lie about.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.320
All right. Remember a couple
of months ago when I wanted a raise?

42:01.360 --> 42:04.440
I don't want to do this. - And
the company wouldn't give me one...

42:04.520 --> 42:07.720
and I asked if you would give it
to me out of your own pocket...

42:07.760 --> 42:11.840
And you said the company would not allow
it, because it would create jealousy...

42:11.880 --> 42:13.960
among the other secretaries.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.760
Was that true, or did you just
not want to pony up the dough?

42:20.400 --> 42:23.080
Greta, please!

42:23.160 --> 42:27.400
Judge Stevens, hi! Fletcher Reede. I'm
scheduled in your court in half an hour.

42:27.440 --> 42:31.080
Judge Stevens, I badly, badly
need a continuance. Ill?

42:31.120 --> 42:34.920
Am I ill? That is
the perfect question for you to ask.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.840
Please lie for me!
- I remember when you bought me this...

42:37.920 --> 42:40.920
antique frame from Tiffany's-
Tiffany's?

42:41.000 --> 42:44.360
Garage sale. Six-fifty,
marked down from ten.

42:46.720 --> 42:49.080
I'll give you the raise!

42:50.120 --> 42:52.000
Here's your raise.

42:52.040 --> 42:56.840
Hi, Judge Stevens!
I know l haven't given you an answer.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.800
But illness could mean so many things.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.120
Can you hold?
Hello? Mom!

43:02.160 --> 43:05.680
Hi! I wasn't really
on vacation.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.920
Because I didn't want
to talk to you!

43:09.000 --> 43:12.680
Because you insist on talking about Dad's
bowel movements- size, color, frequency!

43:12.760 --> 43:15.400
I'll call you later!
Hello?

43:15.480 --> 43:18.080
Oh, damn it!
I cut him off.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.840
I cut off the judge!

43:25.040 --> 43:27.920
Greta! Don't leave!

43:27.960 --> 43:30.760
I'm on my knees
in a 900$ dollars suit!

43:32.440 --> 43:37.200
Mr. Reede. Several years ago,
a friend had a burglar on her roof.

43:37.280 --> 43:41.960
He fell through the skylight, landed on
a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.320
The burglar sued my friend.
He sued my friend!

43:45.400 --> 43:47.520
Because of guys like you, he won!

43:47.560 --> 43:51.840
My friend had to pay the burglar $6,000.
Is that justice?

43:51.880 --> 43:55.120
No. I'd have got him ten.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.760
Good-bye, Mr. Reede.
- No, wait!

43:58.760 --> 44:00.680
I didn't understand!
Ask me again!

44:01.080 --> 44:04.000
Have a nice day in court.
- Greta!

44:05.120 --> 44:07.680
Hi.
- God in heaven!

44:07.760 --> 44:10.040
It's nice to see you too,
Fletcher. Are you busy?

44:10.080 --> 44:13.760
Extremely.
- Good. Would you follow me, please?

44:17.440 --> 44:21.120
Did you know that the partnership
committee is headed by Mr. Allan himself?

44:21.200 --> 44:24.320
You used to work
directly for Mr. Allan.

44:24.360 --> 44:27.760
Yeah.
- Tell me. What do you think of him?

44:27.840 --> 44:31.680
He's a pedantic,
pontificating, pretentious bastard!

44:31.760 --> 44:36.360
A belligerent old fart! A steaming pile
of cow dung! Figuratively speaking.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.400
Really? How delightful.
This way.

44:41.320 --> 44:46.720
Pardon me for interrupting.
Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reede?

44:46.800 --> 44:49.760
Oh, yes! Nice to
see you again, Fletcher.

44:49.800 --> 44:52.720
I'll be observing you
in court this afternoon.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.560
I've been hearing
some good things about you.

44:55.640 --> 45:00.360
Well, Fletcher has just been telling me
how much he thinks of you.

45:00.440 --> 45:04.640
Why don't you tell Mr. Allan?
Well, what do you think of him?

45:11.000 --> 45:15.200
He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard.

45:15.240 --> 45:20.240
A belligerent old fart.
A worthless, steaming pile of cow dung.

45:20.320 --> 45:23.480
Figuratively speaking.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.680
That's the funniest damn thing
I've ever heard!

45:45.760 --> 45:48.480
You're a real card, Reede!

45:48.560 --> 45:50.840
I love a good roast!

45:51.840 --> 45:54.200
Do Simmons!

45:54.240 --> 45:56.320
Simmons is old!

45:56.360 --> 46:00.880
He should have been out years ago, but
he can't stay home 'cause he hates his wife!

46:02.600 --> 46:05.040
You've met her
at the Christmas parties.

46:05.120 --> 46:08.320
She's the one that gets plastered
and calls him a retard.

46:08.360 --> 46:12.400
And you, Tom. You're the biggest
brownnose I've ever seen!

46:12.480 --> 46:17.120
You've got your head so far up
Mr. Allan's ass, I can't tell
where you end and he begins!

46:17.160 --> 46:19.280
Priceless!

46:20.920 --> 46:24.040
You have bad breath
caused by gingivitis.

46:24.120 --> 46:28.520
You couldn't get a porn star
off. Your hairpiece looks like
something that was killed.

46:28.600 --> 46:33.160
I don't know whether to comb it
or scrape it off and bury it in lime!

46:33.240 --> 46:37.480
Loser! Idiot!
Wimp! Degenerate!

46:37.560 --> 46:40.320
Slut!

46:41.920 --> 46:46.160
I like your style, Reede!
That's what this stuffy company needs!

46:46.240 --> 46:50.440
A little irreverence!
- Good! I'll see you later, dick-head!

46:51.440 --> 46:53.920
Dick-head!
Priceless!

47:10.080 --> 47:12.960
Keep your eye on that boy.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.520
Dick-head!

47:33.200 --> 47:37.280
Third District Court is now in session.

47:37.360 --> 47:41.600
The honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens presiding.

47:41.920 --> 47:46.080
Afternoon, Counselors.
Are we ready to begin?

47:46.160 --> 47:48.720
No, sir!
We are not ready to begin...

47:48.800 --> 47:51.000
because my client
has not arrived!

47:51.080 --> 47:52.920
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

47:53.000 --> 47:55.920
<i><b>Here she comes
to wreck the day</b></i>

47:56.000 --> 47:58.720
Mr. Reede!
- Sorry, Your Honor.

47:58.760 --> 48:00.840
Go, go, go. Lupe,
you keep those kids quiet.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.920
I'm not even close to kidding.
- Sí, seòora.

48:02.960 --> 48:06.280
Sorry.
Billy threw up in the car.

48:06.320 --> 48:08.760
You brought your kids
to your divorce?

48:08.840 --> 48:10.920
Sympathy.
- Well, it's working.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.000
I feel sorry for them already.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.400
Miss Appleton, you may begin.

48:15.440 --> 48:18.000
From March 6 through June 12...

48:18.080 --> 48:21.240
I surveilled Mrs. Cole
at the behest of Mr. Cole.

48:21.320 --> 48:23.880
During that period,
I noted that Mr. Cole...

48:23.960 --> 48:26.960
Ieft each day
between 7:40 and 7:50.

48:27.040 --> 48:30.480
Thereafter Mrs. Cole
would frequently have...

48:30.560 --> 48:34.440
a male visitor arrive and stay
from one to four hours.

48:34.480 --> 48:38.960
I was able to take several photographs
of the male visitor.

48:39.040 --> 48:41.480
I see.

48:41.520 --> 48:45.480
Do you know what Mrs. Cole
and her male visitor did...

48:45.520 --> 48:48.480
during these frequent... visits?

48:48.520 --> 48:51.800
Well, they were pretty good
about keeping the shades drawn,

48:51.880 --> 48:56.320
but I was able to make
a recording of one such session.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.800
Your Honor,
as you are aware,

48:59.880 --> 49:02.200
under the terms
of the prenuptial agreement,

49:02.280 --> 49:05.920
if Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.

49:05.960 --> 49:09.720
With your permission, we'd like to play
the following tape recording.

49:14.280 --> 49:16.640
<i><b>Here comes big daddy!</b></i>

49:16.680 --> 49:19.800
<i><b>Oh, God! Do it to me!</b></i>

49:19.880 --> 49:23.480
<i><b>Do it to me! Harder! Harder!</b></i>

49:28.760 --> 49:30.840
Oh, come on!

49:30.920 --> 49:36.240
Your Honor, how can it be proved
that the male voice on that tape
is not Mr. Cole himself?

49:36.320 --> 49:40.280
<i><b>You are such a better lover
than my husband!</b></i>

49:40.360 --> 49:43.720
Your Honor, I object!
- And why is that, Mr. Reede?

49:43.760 --> 49:46.600
It's devastating to my case!
- Overruled.

49:46.640 --> 49:48.640
Good call!

49:48.680 --> 49:52.080
<i><b>I gotta go. I haven't cleaned your pool.
- Your witness.</b></i>

49:52.160 --> 49:55.000
All right.

49:55.080 --> 49:58.040
Well, Mr. Reede,
you may proceed.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.160
How?

50:28.440 --> 50:31.800
Your Honor, would the court be willing
to grant me a short bathroom break?

50:31.880 --> 50:34.600
Can't it wait?
- Yes, it can.

50:34.680 --> 50:37.920
But I've heard that if you hold it,
it can damage the prostate gland,

50:37.960 --> 50:40.440
making it very difficult
to get an erection!

50:40.520 --> 50:43.200
Is that true?
- It has to be.

50:43.240 --> 50:46.080
Well, in that case, I better
take a little break myself.

50:46.120 --> 50:49.320
But you get back here immediately
so we can finish this.

51:05.320 --> 51:09.360
How am I going
to get out of this?

51:10.600 --> 51:13.960
Think. Think.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.800
Think!

52:11.200 --> 52:13.520
What the hell
are you doing?

52:14.640 --> 52:18.360
I'm kicking my ass!
Do you mind?

52:42.120 --> 52:45.000
I found him like this
in the bathroom, Your Honor.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.960
Somebody beat the hell out of him.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.840
Who did this?
- A madman, Your Honor!

52:49.920 --> 52:53.000
A desperate fool at the end
of his pitiful rope!

52:53.080 --> 52:55.120
What did he look like?

52:55.200 --> 52:58.320
About 6'2", 180 pounds,
big teeth, kind of gangly.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.800
Bailiff, have the deputy
search the building.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.240
Yes, sir.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.760
Order! Order!

53:10.120 --> 53:13.440
Under the circumstances, I have
no choice but to recess this case...

53:13.480 --> 53:16.400
until 9:00 a. m.
tomorrow morning.

53:16.480 --> 53:19.560
Unless, of course, you feel
you can still proceed.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.440
Can you?

53:29.680 --> 53:34.120
Yes, I can.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.000
I admire your courage, Mr. Reede.

53:37.080 --> 53:39.640
We'll take a short recess
so that you can compose yourself,

53:39.680 --> 53:41.760
and then we'll get started.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.080
Here you go.

54:01.880 --> 54:05.880
Hello?

54:05.920 --> 54:09.440
Dad?
- Max? How's it goin'?

54:09.480 --> 54:11.960
Great. You know Paul and Emanuel
from across the street?

54:12.000 --> 54:15.600
Yeah. Uh-huh. - Well, they never
want to play baseball with me.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.920
But I told them I'm playing
tonight with my dad.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.160
So now they want to play.
Is that okay?

54:20.200 --> 54:23.080
Sure. The more the merrier.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.160
Coolest! Do you wanna be
Jose Canseco?

54:25.240 --> 54:29.800
Oh, yeah. Who else is gonna hit
that famous Nomo slider?

54:29.880 --> 54:33.120
Mr. Reede.
- I gotta go now, Max.

54:33.200 --> 54:37.920
I'll see you
in a couple hours. Okay? Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.280
He's really coming!
I'm gonna go change.

54:42.360 --> 54:44.320
Okay, go ahead!
- Yeah!

54:48.880 --> 54:50.960
Mr. Reede!

54:51.040 --> 54:55.080
Mr. Reede! Mr. -

54:55.160 --> 54:57.360
This is my lawyer.
He's a little unorthodox.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.000
Mr. Reede, you remember Kenneth Falk,
the man from the tape.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.560
How could I forget?
- Hey, how you doin'?

55:05.600 --> 55:08.640
I've slipped into the seventh
circle of hell! Thank you.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.560
You? - Shouldn't we be going
over our testimony right now?

55:11.640 --> 55:14.400
Basically, the plan is,
I walk you through the tape.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.560
Step-by-step,
I ask you questions.

55:16.640 --> 55:20.360
And we give the explanation
you came up with. - Exactly.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.480
All we gotta do is lie.
That sounds simple enough.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.520
Doesn't it!

55:24.600 --> 55:27.360
Then I'll finish up
with dramatic questions.

55:27.400 --> 55:32.840
Something like: Mr. Falk, isn't it true
that you and Mrs. Cole...

55:32.920 --> 55:36.720
have never made...

55:40.440 --> 55:44.760
Ugh! Oh, God!
I can't do it.

55:44.800 --> 55:48.760
I can't finish the question
if I know the answer is a lie.

56:02.560 --> 56:06.320
You may proceed, Mr. Reede.

56:18.880 --> 56:22.400
Respondent calls...

56:22.480 --> 56:24.360
Kenneth Falk.

56:40.200 --> 56:42.080
Raise your right hand.

56:42.120 --> 56:46.000
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

56:46.080 --> 56:49.640
I do! I mean-

56:52.400 --> 56:55.040
I do.

57:00.280 --> 57:03.040
Mr. Falk.

57:06.040 --> 57:08.120
Do you know my client,
Samantha Cole?

57:08.160 --> 57:10.120
Yes.

57:13.600 --> 57:17.880
Isn't it true that your relationship
with my client is entirely platonic?

57:17.920 --> 57:19.880
I object, Your Honor!

57:19.960 --> 57:22.280
To yourself?

57:22.360 --> 57:24.400
Yeah.

57:24.480 --> 57:28.240
But I would like to...
rephrase the question.

57:30.680 --> 57:33.800
Mr. Falk, would I be accurate...

57:33.880 --> 57:38.400
if I described your relationship
with Mrs. Cole as totally professional?

57:38.440 --> 57:41.480
I object, Your Honor,
and I move to strike!

57:41.560 --> 57:44.040
Mr. Reede, I don't know
what you're on,

57:44.120 --> 57:47.480
but you better get
to the point and quick.

57:47.520 --> 57:49.720
Thank you, sir.

57:52.480 --> 57:55.880
Is your relationship
with my client entirely platonic?

57:55.960 --> 57:58.560
Not! Is not your relationship
with my client:

57:58.600 --> 58:01.760
<i><b>Boink! Bad baby, bad baby!</b></i>

58:01.800 --> 58:03.880
Did you ever not make lo-

58:03.960 --> 58:06.840
Did you-
- Mr. Reede!

58:06.880 --> 58:10.880
You had sex with her every time you met,
didn't you? Didn't you! Liar!

58:10.920 --> 58:13.000
He's badgering the witness.
- It's his witness.

58:13.080 --> 58:16.480
You slammed her! You dunked her donuts!
You gave her dog a "snaussage"!

58:16.520 --> 58:18.840
You stuffed her
like a Thanksgiving turkey!

58:21.280 --> 58:25.960
All right, it's true, okay! I humped
her brains out! There! Now you happy?

58:32.040 --> 58:34.240
No further questions.

58:52.360 --> 58:55.040
No questions.

58:55.080 --> 58:57.920
You may step down.

59:01.240 --> 59:04.400
Do I dare ask you
to call your next witness?

59:07.720 --> 59:10.360
I have no further witnesses,
Your Honor.

59:10.400 --> 59:13.200
What are you doing?
Call me!

59:13.280 --> 59:16.400
You do not understand.
I can't lie.

59:16.480 --> 59:19.280
I can't do anything dishonest
until 8:15 tonight!

59:19.360 --> 59:22.320
Listen, you bastard!
I want my money!

59:22.400 --> 59:25.600
I am not going to end up
a 31-year-old divorcee on welfare...

59:25.640 --> 59:29.120
because my scumbag attorney
had a sudden attack of conscience!

59:29.160 --> 59:31.600
Thirty-one?

59:31.680 --> 59:34.560
If Mr. Reede has
no further witnesses,

59:34.600 --> 59:36.960
then I have no choice
but to rule in favor of-

59:37.000 --> 59:38.840
Your Honor!

59:41.120 --> 59:43.840
I call Samantha Cole
to the stand.

59:43.880 --> 59:47.680
Order.

59:47.720 --> 59:50.520
Order! Order!

59:50.560 --> 59:52.880
Knock it off!
- Sit down!

59:54.680 --> 59:57.160
Mr. Reede, it is out of
sheer morbid curiosity...

59:57.240 --> 59:59.840
I'm allowing this...
freak show to continue.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.960
Mrs. Cole...
if you dare.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.280
Mrs. Cole...

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.680
is this a copy
of your driver's license?

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.480
Yes. - It says here
you're a blonde. Are you?

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.320
If you don't remember,
perhaps Mr. Falk will.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.960
Brunette. - We can play the tape
again. Maybe it's on there.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.000
I'm a brunette!

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.200
Thank you.
Now let's see.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.200
<i><b>Weight: 105.
Yeah! In your bra.</b></i>

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.120
Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.040
Bastard!
- Hag!

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.920
Quiet! Overruled! Weight?

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.600
One-eighteen.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.520
All right, fine, fine.
I'm 127.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.560
Uh-huh. And it says here
you were born in 1964,

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.840
but that's not true
either, is it?

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.760
Is it!
- No.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.560
Will you tell me what it says here on your
birth certificate under "date of birth"?

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.080
Your Honor, what does this
have to do with anything?

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.960
Overruled. Mrs. Cole,
answer the question.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.160
<i><b>1965.</b></i>

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.560
Now let me get this straight.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.160
That would mean that you lied
about your age to make yourself older.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.400
But why would any woman
want to do that?

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.920
I changed it
so I could get married.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.360
And the truth
shall set you free!

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.040
My client lied about her age!

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.360
She was only 17 when she got married,
which makes her a minor,

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.720
and in the great
state of California,

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.000
no minor can enter
into any legal contract...

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.200
without parental consent,
including-

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.120
Prenuptial agreements.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.040
Prenuptial agreements!
This contract is void!

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.680
The fact that my client has been ridden
more than Seattle Slew is irrelevant.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.640
Standard Community Property applies, and she
is entitled to half of the marital assets,

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.120
or $11.395 million!

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.320
Jordan fades back. Swoosh!
And that's the game!

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.400
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.040
Order. Order. Order!

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.320
In light of this new evidence,

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.840
the court must rule
in favor of Mrs. Cole.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.800
Yes! - She is hereby awarded
half the marital assets.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.680
The son of a bitch pulled it off!

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.920
I didn't know! - It doesn't
matter. The contract's void.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.880
Order. Order.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.320
I understand both parties
have agreed to joint custody.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.880
Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.360
Yes.
- No.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.280
I'm contesting custody.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.760
What?
- If I get sole custody,

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.280
that's another ten grand
in child support payments.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.640
You just won $11 million!

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.440
Hey, I'm the victim here.
You said it yourself.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.800
Now I'm gonna hit him
where it hurts.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.080
But you-
you said he was a good father.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.560
So?

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:21.040
Well, Mr. Reede, do we have
an agreement on custody or not?

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.440
No.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.280
I see.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.080
In that case, there will be a custody
hearing on the 19th at 9:00 a.m.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.360
Court is adjourned.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.800
Come on, let's go.
- Daddy!

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.680
You stop that whining, or I'll
give you something to whine about!

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.320
I wanna go with Daddy!

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.120
Come here, kids. Come on.
It's all right. Don't you worry.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.200
I promise we'll be together,
whatever I have to do.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.240
It's okay. It's okay.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.200
Oh, for God's sake, will you
give me those? They're mine!

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.080
Let go of Daddy! Let go of him!
Let go of Daddy!

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.400
We're leaving now! Lupe, come on!
- Sí, seòora.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.520
Don't you have some checks to write?
You haven't paid for them yet.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.840
I love children.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.720
They give you so much leverage
in a case like this.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.960
You did an incredible job, partner.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.240
Look at him.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.680
He's stunned.
He can't believe it.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.320
Your Honor, may I please
approach the bench?

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.640
We're adjourned, Mr. Reede.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.040
Your Honor, I think
we've made a big mistake.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.480
Mr. Reede, I am tired
and very cranky.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.160
I know, but this is
just... wrong, isn't it?

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.240
I manipulated the system.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.080
Just because you bought it doesn't mean
I'm right. It's a technicality!

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.160
Young man, having my judgement
mocked in my own court...

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.480
is not something
I'm prepared to tolerate!

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.680
Well, tell that to the kids when they're
adopted... by the Manson family!

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.640
One more word out of you, Mr. Reede,
and I'll hold you in contempt!

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.520
I hold myself in contempt!

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.720
Why should you be any different?

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.720
Bailiff, take him away!

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.560
This man is a good father,
and children are not leverage!

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.720
Oh, no, don't do this!
I have a date to play ball with my son!

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.320
I can't be late!
It's my last chance!

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.640
I'm Jose Canseco!

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.960
I'm Jose Canseco!

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.680
Phone call!
Phone call!

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.560
I get a phone call!
I get a phone call!

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.680
I get a phone call!

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.120
Hello?

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.720
Audrey, it's me.
Don't hang up!

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.280
I can't talk right now.
Our flight leaves at 8:00.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:58.320
What? - I'm taking Max someplace
where you can't do this anymore.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.560
Audrey, wait! The most amazing
thing has happened to me.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.200
I'm a changed man! Just come to
the courthouse with $1,000 and bail me out.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.120
Hello? Hello?

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.280
Time's up, pal. - No, just one
more call. Just one more call.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.400
Okay, let's go.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.880
Ready?
- Yeah.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.760
Will you get the door, please?
- Okay.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.000
Thank you.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.400
Mr. Reede, you made bail.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.440
Greta! Oh, thank God!

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.960
Am I too late?
Have you been sexually molested yet?

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.400
Because I could circle the block.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.720
How did you know I was here?

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.960
One of the other secretaries
called me at home,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.360
said you went all noble
in front of Mr. Allan.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.600
Yeah, I think I'm fired.
Isn't that great?

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.880
I'll start my own firm.
Do you need a job?

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.360
I don't think
you can afford me.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.000
Oh, man, I gotta get my car.
Audrey's on her way to the airport.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:02.640
I could lose Max forever.
I can't let that happen. I love him!

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.200
You know, this truth stuff
is pretty cool.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:09.120
I love my son!
I love my son!

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.720
I love my son!
I love my son!

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.320
Hey, need some change?
Take everything!

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.080
But it's not gonna make you happy.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.480
I love my son!

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.720
I love my son!

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.440
I love my son!

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.720
Hey, there you are!

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.440
Hi.
- Just in time.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.400
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my entire life.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.600
O-Oh! Well, m-me, m-mine-

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.920
Well, ours... also.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.320
Hey, gipper. I have something
for you, young man.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:50.000
Ooh, watch yourself.
It's the claw!

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.560
Ooh, the claw's comin' at ya.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.400
Ooh, you're scared of the claw.
You're scared of the claw.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.480
Jerry. Jerry.
- Huh?

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.720
It's okay.
You don't have to-

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.160
Tower Air flight 1511
to Boston is now boarding.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.080
Ooh, that's us.
- Yeah.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.680
Ready to go?
- Yes. You ready?

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.800
Okay.
- Great.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.600
Jim Rubing, please report
to Airport Security.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.680
Excuse me!

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.560
What gate is flight 1511 leaving from?
It's an emergency!

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.800
Gate number 123,
but you'll never make it.
Flight's already boarding.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.520
It takes more than a half hour
to get through security.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.359
If you want to go to Boston,
there's another flight leaving
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:36.600
Flight number one-twenty-

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.439
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard flight 1511...

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.640
from Los Angeles
to Boston's Logan Airport.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.319
We'll be departing shortly, and if you
need help stowing your carry-on items-

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.200
Honey, can I help you?
- I'm fine.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.080
Are you sure?
- Jerry, I can open the bag!

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.680
Would you like anything
to drink before takeoff?

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.760
Yes. Anything
with alcohol, please.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.160
Audrey.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.840
If you'll focus on the screen,
we'll be running a safety video.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.960
How about that drink?

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.399
Max! Max!

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.840
Max!

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.120
Wait!

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.359
That oughta do it.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.680
Thanks! It's running great!

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.720
Max!

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.680
Hey! Max!

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.200
Max! I'm coming!

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.200
Max!

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.600
Max! Max, where are you?

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.680
I love you.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.360
Thank you.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.240
That wasn't exactly
the answer I was looking for.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.160
Thank you very much?

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.480
I'm sorry. It's just-
- Too fast?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.840
It was too fast, wasn't it?
- No, i-it's-

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.160
Chemistry?
Whatever it is, we can work on it.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.560
No, no, no. It's just that-
- Oh, my God, it's Fletcher!

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.280
No, no, this has nothing to do with
Fletcher. - No, honey, it's Fletcher.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.440
What?
- Dad?

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.440
I made it!
I'm late, but I made it!

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.160
What is he doing?

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.760
He came to see us off. Wave.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.560
I won't let you go!

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.800
Oh, shit!

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.280
Control one-nine, this is
Tower 1511, heavy. Ready for takeoff.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.840
What was that?
- Looked like a shoe.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.040
Pull over!

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.560
Pull this thing over!

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.520
Control one-nine, some idiot
has hijacked a flight of stairs.
We're gonna stop this plane.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.040
One-nine Control. We copy.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.480
No-o-o-o-o!

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.160
You people are all doing
a wonderful job!

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.240
That's far enough, folks.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.960
He's my husband-
was my husband.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.920
All right, go ahead.
- Okay.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.080
Max, you stay here with Jerry,
and I'll be right back, okay?

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.520
Audrey! Great news!
- Fletcher!

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.720
Both my legs are broken,
so they can't take me right to jail.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.600
Fletcher, what were you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.360
No, I'm thinking clear.
I've never been this clear!

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.680
Dad?
- Creep.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.200
He was getting kind of upset.
- Are you all right?

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.280
Yeah. I'm hurtin' here, though.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.840
I'm a dope, Max.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.240
All this time
you've been here...

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.000
and I could see you anytime,
but I didn't.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.440
Then your mom told me you were moving
to Boston, and I started thinking.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.000
I could be sitting around
sometime and...

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.520
want to look at you
and hold you and play with you,

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.680
and I won't be able to.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.080
I don't think I'm gonna
do too well with that.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.120
I love you more than anything else
in the world, Max,

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.400
and you know it's true.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.400
I couldn't say it if it
wasn't true. Not today.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.160
I love you, and I'll
never hurt you again.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.680
He's telling the truth, Mom.
He's not allowed to lie.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.440
I made a wish, and anything Dad
says today has to be the truth.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.360
Max.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.760
It's 8:45.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.040
You made the wish at 8:15.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.840
I've been able to lie
for the last half hour.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.000
So you weren't-
- No, it was the truth!

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.400
I just wanted
to be honest with you.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.800
I always want
to be honest with you.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.040
Mom, do we have to go to Boston?

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.080
No, Max, you don't have to go.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.640
I, on the other hand,
do have to.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.440
A hospital to run.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.480
That's an open-ended ticket
if you ever change your mind.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.680
Thank you.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.200
Looks like he's
got his father back.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:46.000
<i><b>Happy birthday, dear Maximus</b></i>

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:52.240
<i><b>Happy birthday to you</b></i>

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:54.280
Okay, Max, make a wish.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.800
Ahhh, wait! I don't know
if we should do this.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.760
Oh, Fletcher, come on. What are
the odds of that happening again?

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.040
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.120
Okay, Max, go ahead.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.040
Mom? Dad?

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.040
Max!

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:40.640
Did you wish for your mom and I
to get back together again?

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.040
No, I wished for Rollerblades.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.120
Do you want to cut the cake...

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.040
Dad?

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.200
I'd love to.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.000
But I have
this horrible pain in my arm.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.000
Oh, no, it's the claw!

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.800
No one can stop the claw!

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.000
No one can stop it!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.240
Nothing can stop the claw!

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.000
If I was a boxer, l would bounce
those things like Sugar Ray Leonard.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.920
I'm sorry.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.320
Brought your kids
to your divorce?

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.280
Sympathy.
- Well, it's working!

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.760
I feel sorry for them already.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.840
For this you will pay
a terrible price.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.760
Well, it's working!
I feel sorry for them already.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.120
Mrs. Cole...

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.760
a goose.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.200
Including-

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.120
Prenuptial agreements.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.360
<i><b>Prenuptial agreements</b></i>

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.000
No! I'd have got him ten.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.240
Good-bye, Mr. Reede.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.680
No! Wait!
I didn't know she had-

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.400
Oh, shit.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.240
<i><b>Now let's see.
Weight: 105?</b></i>

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.280
Yeah! In your bra.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.520
Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.600
Overactor!
- Jezebel!

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.520
He put me up to it.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.400
Yeah, sure he did.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.360
Oh, no.
They're onto me.
