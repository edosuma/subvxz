01:19.988 --> 01:22.488
Siberia...

01:22.574 --> 01:26.368
...not known for its tourist trade
or overpopulation.

01:26.369 --> 01:30.664
That's exactly why it's such
a popular place for political prisoners

01:30.665 --> 01:34.085
and nuclear facilities.

02:30.850 --> 02:34.478
This is a nuclear
reconstitution plant.

02:34.645 --> 02:36.021
The work is dangerous,

02:36.022 --> 02:38.398
and they don't get a lot
of volunteers to do it.

02:38.399 --> 02:43.249
So political prisoners
like Yuri Demetri get assigned.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.209
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

02:59.753 --> 03:03.143
"Howdy"?
That's an American greeting.

03:04.258 --> 03:05.592
MacGyver?

03:05.593 --> 03:08.093
Yuri Demetri?

03:08.387 --> 03:10.597
How'd you Iike to go back
to the United States with me?

03:10.598 --> 03:12.432
Your father's kind of anxious
to see you again.

03:12.433 --> 03:13.725
You saw my father?

03:13.726 --> 03:15.560
Yeah.

03:15.561 --> 03:16.894
And he wants you to know

03:16.895 --> 03:19.814
he's sorry you've had to suffer
because of his defection.

03:19.815 --> 03:21.983
So he arranged all the papers
and passport?

03:21.984 --> 03:24.484
Well, not exactly.

03:25.821 --> 03:28.573
No, that's crazy. You can't get me
through the gates without papers.

03:28.574 --> 03:30.074
They'II stop us. They'II shoot!

03:30.075 --> 03:33.536
Who said anything
about going through?

03:33.537 --> 03:36.957
- Hang tight.
- "Hang tight"?

04:05.944 --> 04:08.444
Hey, Yuri.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.291
No, MacGyver, you're crazy!

04:22.294 --> 04:24.794
No!

04:30.385 --> 04:33.387
It was a real trick
getting Yuri Demetri out of Russia,

04:33.388 --> 04:34.972
but we finally made it.

04:34.973 --> 04:38.475
And Yuri was already making me
appreciate how much

04:38.476 --> 04:41.938
we take our freedom for granted.

04:48.653 --> 04:50.320
That'II be 18 bucks, pal.

04:50.321 --> 04:52.821
There you go. Thanks.

04:53.658 --> 04:55.367
That's where you Iive?

04:55.368 --> 04:57.868
- Yeah, that's it.
- Good.

04:57.912 --> 04:59.246
Then I'II soon see my father.

04:59.247 --> 05:01.623
Just as soon as Pete sends us a car.

05:01.624 --> 05:04.294
Let's wait upstairs. Come on.

05:19.016 --> 05:24.416
- There is a Mrs. MacGyver?
- No, there's no Mrs. MacGyver.

05:29.235 --> 05:31.319
MacGyver! Hi!

05:31.320 --> 05:33.280
Penny Parker?
What are you doing here?

05:33.281 --> 05:35.824
Oh, well, you're probably
not gonna believe this,

05:35.825 --> 05:38.994
- but you remember that job I had?
- No.

05:38.995 --> 05:40.620
Oh, well, anyways, it didn't work out.

05:40.621 --> 05:42.330
So I got this other job
as a sales clerk

05:42.331 --> 05:44.874
at one of those fancy stores
on Rodeo Drive.

05:44.875 --> 05:48.336
And it was going really, really well
until I had this Iittle accident.

05:48.337 --> 05:50.839
And, well, after the fire truck came...

05:50.840 --> 05:52.090
Fire truck?

05:52.091 --> 05:56.219
Yeah. And the boss, he got really mad
and he blew his top and he fired me.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.263
So, see, I'm kind of broke,

05:58.264 --> 06:00.431
and I figured you wouldn't mind
if I stayed here.

06:00.432 --> 06:01.850
You don't mind, do you?

06:01.851 --> 06:04.060
As a matter of fact,
I have a problem with that.

06:04.061 --> 06:07.188
Well, I won't be here that Iong,
because I got another job.

06:07.189 --> 06:09.190
That's why I'm dressed Iike this.

06:09.191 --> 06:12.110
Hello, MacGyver
How you been doing?

06:12.111 --> 06:15.155
So happy to see you again

06:16.615 --> 06:18.700
I'm a singing telegram star.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.576
See, I decided to go back
into show business.

06:20.577 --> 06:23.457
It's always been my first Iove.

06:24.248 --> 06:25.623
Who are you?

06:25.624 --> 06:26.958
Yuri Demetri.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.710
I Iove you.

06:28.711 --> 06:32.255
That's so sweet.
Hi, I'm Penny Parker.

06:32.256 --> 06:33.840
Penny, how did you get in here?

06:33.841 --> 06:36.759
Well, I told the manager
that I was your girlfriend.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.720
And that I was kind of pregnant.

06:40.889 --> 06:43.389
I don't believe this.

06:43.433 --> 06:46.644
You are pregnant,
and he will not make you honest?

06:46.645 --> 06:49.855
- Then I'II marry her!
- Yuri, she said that to get in here.

06:49.856 --> 06:52.483
Look, I'm going
on vacation tomorrow.

06:52.484 --> 06:55.604
Well, then I can housesit for you.

06:55.612 --> 06:58.739
Just till Friday?
I get my first paycheck then. PIease?

06:58.740 --> 07:01.450
Here? Are you kidding me?
Look what you've done to my place.

07:01.451 --> 07:05.121
Well, I'II clean it up.
I'II be good. I promise.

07:05.122 --> 07:08.833
Penny, don't you have any relatives?
Any friends?

07:08.834 --> 07:11.334
I have you.

07:14.256 --> 07:15.798
Till Friday?

07:15.799 --> 07:17.758
Yeah.

07:17.759 --> 07:20.349
Oh, thanks. What time is it?

07:20.512 --> 07:22.638
Oh, my gosh! I'm gonna be Iate.

07:22.639 --> 07:25.307
I have to deliver a telegram
to the BIuesteins.

07:25.308 --> 07:27.351
It's their 50th wedding anniversary.

07:27.352 --> 07:29.144
Here.

07:29.145 --> 07:31.685
Bye, Yuri. Nice meeting you.

07:31.815 --> 07:34.316
I'II bring your Jeep back
when I'm done.

07:34.317 --> 07:35.985
Jeep?

07:35.986 --> 07:37.403
My Jeep?

07:37.404 --> 07:39.780
What are you talking about? Penny!

07:39.781 --> 07:41.448
My Jeep?

07:41.449 --> 07:45.649
Don't worry.
I'II fill the tank up with gas.

07:54.003 --> 07:56.338
Come on, Julian,
you can either talk to us now

07:56.339 --> 07:59.508
or talk to us Iater.
A very painful affair.

07:59.509 --> 08:02.970
You know, it only takes
150 decibels to shatter the human ear.

08:02.971 --> 08:04.429
I thought it would be more.

08:04.430 --> 08:09.351
I told you no one knows about you.
I swear I just found out myself.

08:09.352 --> 08:12.397
Sorry. Wrong answer.

08:16.275 --> 08:18.068
Is this really necessary?

08:18.069 --> 08:21.071
You tell me. We're here to make a hit,
this guy knows about it.

08:21.072 --> 08:22.614
I wanna know
who else knows about it.

08:22.615 --> 08:25.367
- What do you suggest?
- Yeah. Get him a manicure?

08:25.368 --> 08:26.868
You wanna talk to him?

08:26.869 --> 08:32.448
Come on, he's your friend.
You worked with him for 10 years.

08:37.797 --> 08:40.297
They all Iook the same.

08:40.716 --> 08:43.970
2258 and 30.

08:44.135 --> 08:46.636
2224.

08:48.015 --> 08:49.265
2216.

08:49.266 --> 08:51.766
2210.

08:52.311 --> 08:54.811
2202...

08:56.732 --> 08:59.067
Oh, well.

08:59.068 --> 09:03.778
Gosh. I guess I put that address
in here somewhere.

09:04.281 --> 09:07.551
I know it had a Iot of twos in it.

09:07.910 --> 09:09.744
Music.

09:09.745 --> 09:11.079
A party.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.580
This must be it.

09:15.918 --> 09:18.418
Okay.

09:28.597 --> 09:30.640
Like the music, Julian?

09:30.641 --> 09:34.451
Go ahead and scream.
Nobody can hear you.

09:42.611 --> 09:47.074
Derek, get me off this thing!

09:52.829 --> 09:55.329
Hello?

09:58.627 --> 10:00.127
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

10:00.128 --> 10:01.504
I knew it would work.

10:01.505 --> 10:04.340
I gotta hand it to you.
I had my doubts, but you pulled it off.

10:04.341 --> 10:05.966
What did you do?
What's wrong with him?

10:05.967 --> 10:08.969
He passed out.
You feds got no stamina.

10:08.970 --> 10:11.470
Popped his eardrums.

10:18.897 --> 10:21.106
Hello?

10:21.107 --> 10:23.275
Hello?

10:23.276 --> 10:25.528
Singing telegram.

10:25.529 --> 10:28.072
Are you guys crazy?
What's the point?

10:28.073 --> 10:31.700
It amuses us to test the Iimits
of the human body.

10:31.701 --> 10:33.285
And it works. People talk.

10:33.286 --> 10:34.870
Yeah, but he didn't tell us anything.

10:34.871 --> 10:36.997
He told us all we need to know.

10:36.998 --> 10:39.333
He's the only one knows
about the hit we got planned.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.710
We're in the clear.

10:41.711 --> 10:44.541
AII right, all right. What now?

10:44.839 --> 10:47.339
Now we kill him.

10:49.511 --> 10:53.890
Hey, hey
It's Mel and Claudia's anniversary

10:54.057 --> 10:56.683
For them I wrote
This little verse you see

10:56.684 --> 11:00.254
So sing and dance
And have some fun...

11:01.397 --> 11:03.524
You're not the BIuesteins.

11:03.525 --> 11:06.025
Grab her, Vince.

11:11.115 --> 11:13.615
It's Iocked.

11:36.557 --> 11:38.266
Terrific, she's gone. Now what?

11:38.267 --> 11:40.477
I got her Iicense plate number.

11:40.478 --> 11:41.937
Think you could track her down?

11:41.938 --> 11:44.898
Maybe you can use
that old fed training of yours.

11:44.899 --> 11:46.441
If we're not imposing.

11:46.442 --> 11:47.901
While you do what?

11:47.902 --> 11:49.903
Finish the business with Julian.

11:49.904 --> 11:52.280
Then we're moving out
of this neighbourhood.

11:52.281 --> 11:54.908
You can meet us
at the old fish cannery.

11:54.909 --> 11:57.077
Don't be so shaky, Derek.

11:57.078 --> 12:00.789
Just find the girl.
We'II take care of the rest.

12:00.790 --> 12:03.417
Yeah, we enjoy our work.

12:17.473 --> 12:20.725
Yes, I think we can find
room for him temporarily.

12:20.726 --> 12:23.478
We'II take full responsibility.

12:23.479 --> 12:25.979
Yes, I understand.

12:26.231 --> 12:28.731
We'II Iook after him.

12:28.817 --> 12:30.818
Small change of plans, Yuri.

12:30.819 --> 12:33.321
Your father's been sent to New York
for security reasons,

12:33.322 --> 12:35.531
so you're gonna join him
there tomorrow,

12:35.532 --> 12:38.159
after the State Department
has had time to debrief you.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.703
So I'II spend some time
with my new American friends,

12:40.704 --> 12:42.288
MacGyver and Penny Parker.

12:42.289 --> 12:45.083
No, no. I'm afraid you're gonna
have to stay right here.

12:45.084 --> 12:47.835
And, MacGyver, I want you
to go with him all the way to New York.

12:47.836 --> 12:49.921
Now, wait a minute.

12:49.922 --> 12:53.466
Aren't you the guy that told me to go to
Russia and then take some time off?

12:53.467 --> 12:55.843
Pete, I went to Russia.

12:55.844 --> 12:58.429
I know you did.
But what's one more day?

12:58.430 --> 13:01.057
Besides,
we don't want Yuri travelling

13:01.058 --> 13:06.268
with some rookie agent
that he doesn't even know, do we?

13:09.149 --> 13:10.650
Right.

13:10.651 --> 13:13.151
What's one more day?

13:14.321 --> 13:18.700
You and me,
it's Iike Butch and Sundance.

13:19.493 --> 13:21.702
Butch and Sundance?

13:21.703 --> 13:24.331
I Iove American cinema.

13:39.095 --> 13:41.723
That'II be $4.50, sir.

13:43.183 --> 13:45.683
Keep it.

13:47.312 --> 13:50.565
MacGyver! MacGyver, wait! PIease!

13:51.232 --> 13:53.732
MacGyver, wait!

13:54.194 --> 13:56.694
Wait, MacGyver!

14:02.368 --> 14:03.702
MacGyver, you're--

14:03.703 --> 14:05.412
You're not gonna believe
what I just saw.

14:05.413 --> 14:07.122
I mean, I don't believe
what I just saw.

14:07.123 --> 14:09.458
I went out on my job,
only I couldn't find my address,

14:09.459 --> 14:11.752
so I thought I'd go
to a bunch of houses, you know,

14:11.753 --> 14:13.545
figuring I'd find
the right one eventually.

14:13.546 --> 14:16.465
Anyways, this one house I went into,
it had these four guys in it.

14:16.466 --> 14:18.216
And the one,
he was strapped to this board

14:18.217 --> 14:19.676
and he Iooked Iike a TV antenna.

14:19.677 --> 14:21.511
I mean, he had wires
coming out of his ears--

14:21.512 --> 14:23.221
- TV antenna?
- Yeah!

14:23.222 --> 14:25.307
And then these three men,
they came chasing after me

14:25.308 --> 14:26.558
and I barely got away.

14:26.559 --> 14:29.019
I tried to Iock them into the garage,
but they got out somehow.

14:29.020 --> 14:31.855
And then I got in the Jeep and I really
thought they were gonna get me

14:31.856 --> 14:34.566
because I put it in reverse
and I hit that parked car behind me.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.860
What? You hit a car with my Jeep?

14:36.861 --> 14:38.236
Yeah, I'm really sorry,

14:38.237 --> 14:39.905
- but I was so scared.
- You did!

14:39.906 --> 14:41.740
I was so scared,
and they were gonna kill me.

14:41.741 --> 14:45.911
I just know it! I'II pay for the damages,
and it's not that bad.

14:45.912 --> 14:48.872
It's just that I panicked,
and I put the car in the wrong gear.

14:48.873 --> 14:51.458
Anyways,
we have to go back there right now.

14:51.459 --> 14:52.667
Back where?

14:52.668 --> 14:55.462
To that house!
With the torture chamber.

14:55.463 --> 14:58.381
That man, he's dead.
Or at Ieast close to it.

14:58.382 --> 15:01.760
He was all beaten up and he had wires
coming out of his head.

15:01.761 --> 15:06.514
There's gotta be a Iogical explanation
for what you think you saw.

15:06.515 --> 15:08.183
Logic has nothing to do with it.

15:08.184 --> 15:10.185
Now, we've gotta go back there
and help that man.

15:10.186 --> 15:11.603
Right now. PIease, MacGyver?

15:11.604 --> 15:13.438
Why don't we just call the police?

15:13.439 --> 15:16.107
Because I can't remember
the address.

15:16.108 --> 15:17.942
- But you remember how to get there?
- Yes!

15:17.943 --> 15:21.154
And there's no time to Iose.
Come on, Iet's go. PIease.

15:21.155 --> 15:24.241
- Okay, Iet's go.
- Good.

15:30.414 --> 15:33.291
Well, all I remember is that
the street was named after a tree.

15:33.292 --> 15:36.085
Penny, all the streets around here
are named after trees.

15:36.086 --> 15:38.212
This is Forest Knoll Estates.

15:38.213 --> 15:40.465
Now, come on, you told me
you knew where this place was.

15:40.466 --> 15:43.634
I do. It's just around this corner.

15:43.635 --> 15:46.304
You said that about the Iast corner.

15:46.305 --> 15:47.680
I think we'd be a Iot better off

15:47.681 --> 15:49.474
if we just went home
and called the police.

15:49.475 --> 15:51.975
No, there's no time.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.561
We're almost there.

15:53.562 --> 15:55.980
How did you get there
in the first place?

15:55.981 --> 15:58.483
Well, there was music
playing before.

15:58.484 --> 16:01.402
I know the address
had a Iot of twos in it.

16:01.403 --> 16:03.487
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, that's it.

16:03.488 --> 16:06.199
It was brown. I know it.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.701
- I know that's it.
- Penny...

16:08.702 --> 16:11.078
...they're all brown around here.

16:11.079 --> 16:12.580
No, but this is it.

16:12.581 --> 16:14.915
I'm absolutely positive.

16:14.916 --> 16:17.418
Come on.
We gotta get that man out of there.

16:17.419 --> 16:19.919
Great.

16:20.172 --> 16:22.339
Wait a minute. Hold it.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.050
You went in through the garage?

16:24.051 --> 16:27.386
No, I went in through the front door,
but I came around into the garage.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.181
The man, he's in there. Open it.

16:30.182 --> 16:33.184
Why don't I see
if there's someone at home, all right?

16:33.185 --> 16:36.980
If you're not gonna open it,
then I am.

16:39.858 --> 16:42.860
Where's all the gym stuff?
Where's Vince?

16:42.861 --> 16:44.695
Where's the man with the antenna?

16:44.696 --> 16:46.530
Penny, I think you may
have made a mistake.

16:46.531 --> 16:48.699
Where's Vince?
Come on, what's going on here?

16:48.700 --> 16:51.200
Sorry about this.

16:53.455 --> 16:57.685
Well, I think maybe
it's the house next door.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.378
Who was that woman?

17:01.379 --> 17:02.796
Who's Vince?

17:02.797 --> 17:04.423
What was she doing in my house?

17:04.424 --> 17:06.049
How should I know?

17:06.050 --> 17:09.553
You're the one that wanted
to move to California.

17:09.554 --> 17:14.391
The voice-activated detonator
will be placed on the wheelchair, see?

17:14.392 --> 17:17.227
- AII set.
- And where will Estevez be?

17:17.228 --> 17:20.063
Next to the wheelchair
at ground zero.

17:20.064 --> 17:22.107
This better work.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.568
You're always picking on my stuff.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.236
- Corned beef?
- Yeah.

17:26.237 --> 17:28.864
Let me tell you something.
You worry me.

17:28.865 --> 17:31.658
My Iife is in your hands
with your Iittle gadgets.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.911
Trust me.
Have I ever Iet you down in 13 years?

17:34.912 --> 17:36.413
But these Colombians are different.

17:36.414 --> 17:38.915
You miss the first hit with them,
you become the hit.

17:38.916 --> 17:41.585
We don't find this Estevez guy
before he talks to the feds,

17:41.586 --> 17:43.920
it's hasta mañana for us, amigo.

17:43.921 --> 17:45.755
This corned beef's got mustard on it.

17:45.756 --> 17:48.256
Scrape it off.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.136
I'II tell you what worries me.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.138
Having this guy, Derek,
as our inside man.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.639
He's wrapped too tight.

17:56.392 --> 17:59.312
Derek, baby, how are you?

17:59.937 --> 18:02.772
Did you get Estevez's voice
on the tape Iike I asked you?

18:02.773 --> 18:05.734
Yes, I was right there
at the airport when he arrived.

18:05.735 --> 18:10.697
Of course, you could always
catch him again on the 6:00 news.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.199
You know, you're only gonna have
one opportunity.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.035
It has to work.

18:15.036 --> 18:17.245
We'II give you a written guarantee.

18:17.246 --> 18:20.076
Come on, have something to eat.

18:23.085 --> 18:25.795
I got you a hot pastrami on rye.

18:25.796 --> 18:28.631
You get a Iine on that singing telegram
in the cowboy suit?

18:28.632 --> 18:31.634
DMV shows the Jeep is registered
to some guy named MacGyver.

18:31.635 --> 18:34.220
- Here's the address.
- Figure he's the boyfriend?

18:34.221 --> 18:35.638
Whoever.

18:35.639 --> 18:37.223
He's in bad company.

18:37.224 --> 18:38.641
What are you going to do?

18:38.642 --> 18:41.311
First we're gonna take care
of that Iittle girl. Permanently.

18:41.312 --> 18:42.770
He's with her, he goes too.

18:42.771 --> 18:44.814
And then we're gonna
take care of our hit.

18:44.815 --> 18:48.443
I got a Iittle surprise for Estevez
before he talks to the feds.

18:48.444 --> 18:50.069
What kind of surprise?

18:50.070 --> 18:51.487
Let me put it to you this way.

18:51.488 --> 18:54.157
He's gonna be sorry
he ever opened his mouth.

18:54.158 --> 18:56.658
You're gonna Iove this.

18:58.328 --> 19:01.706
Mr. Estevez, Mr. Estevez,
does your trip to California

19:01.707 --> 19:04.917
have anything to do
with the drug problem in this country?

19:04.918 --> 19:06.752
If solutions to our drug problem

19:06.753 --> 19:10.631
depends in our cooperation between
my country and the United States...

19:10.632 --> 19:12.800
It takes my device a few seconds.

19:12.801 --> 19:15.177
It's gotta make sure
it's got the right voice.

19:15.178 --> 19:21.688
I think I have some ideas that will
greatly reduce the flow of traffic.

19:24.980 --> 19:28.607
Now, you gonna stop
making fun of my stuff?

19:28.608 --> 19:30.818
And you...

19:30.819 --> 19:34.281
You just put this where it belongs.

19:36.867 --> 19:38.784
Hey, Derek...

19:38.785 --> 19:41.285
...you forgot your sandwich.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.958
This is it. Here it comes.

19:48.628 --> 19:51.213
Now, don't expect too much.
It's really a small scene.

19:51.214 --> 19:52.965
I'm sure you did just fine, Penny.

19:52.966 --> 19:55.926
Well, the director did say
I was a natural.

19:55.927 --> 19:58.427
Here it comes.

20:06.479 --> 20:08.021
That was it?

20:08.022 --> 20:10.567
Well, I said it was small.

20:11.192 --> 20:12.651
That was you?

20:12.652 --> 20:18.422
Yeah. I mean, after all,
it was just my first professional job.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.826
Yeah.

20:20.827 --> 20:22.411
Well, you did just fine, Penny.

20:22.412 --> 20:24.413
- How about some more popcorn?
- Sure.

20:24.414 --> 20:26.248
Now stay tuned
for our newsbreak update.

20:26.249 --> 20:28.250
You know, you're a really great host.

20:28.251 --> 20:30.127
Colombia's Javier Estevez

20:30.128 --> 20:33.088
arrived at Los Angeles
International Airport this afternoon

20:33.089 --> 20:34.589
under heavy security.

20:34.590 --> 20:38.260
Estevez is expected to meet
with the local police and DEA officials

20:38.261 --> 20:39.594
Iater this week.

20:39.595 --> 20:43.932
Estevez was asked how far-reaching
his U. S. visit will be.

20:43.933 --> 20:46.810
If solutions to our drug problems
are to be found,

20:46.811 --> 20:48.728
there must be more cooperation

20:48.729 --> 20:50.564
- between Colombia and the United...
- That's him!

20:50.565 --> 20:52.566
- That's him!
- Who?

20:52.567 --> 20:54.401
That's-- The guy behind Estevez.

20:54.402 --> 20:56.611
That is the guy
that I saw in the garage today.

20:56.612 --> 20:58.572
- ...flowing of drug traffic between...
- Where?

20:58.573 --> 21:00.991
An important visit
by a man with something to say.

21:00.992 --> 21:02.242
I'm Hettie Lynne Hurtes

21:02.243 --> 21:05.120
reporting for Channel Three News
from the airport.

21:05.121 --> 21:06.830
Now back to you, Michael.

21:06.831 --> 21:10.083
Shoot. I swear that was him,
MacGyver. I swear it.

21:10.084 --> 21:11.793
You're sure it's the same man?

21:11.794 --> 21:13.670
Yeah, I'm sure it's the same man.

21:13.671 --> 21:15.755
His Ieft shoulder
was Iower than his right.

21:15.756 --> 21:18.133
And he had a really small upper Iip.

21:18.134 --> 21:19.634
You saw all that?

21:19.635 --> 21:23.763
Yeah. I'm an actress.
It's my job to study people.

21:23.764 --> 21:26.224
MacGyver,
we have to do something.

21:26.225 --> 21:27.475
AII right.

21:27.476 --> 21:31.604
AII right, I'II have Pete Iine up a copy
of that newsbreak as soon as possible.

21:31.605 --> 21:33.815
MacGyver, I'm really scared.

21:33.816 --> 21:35.608
You'II be all right, Penny.

21:35.609 --> 21:37.318
I need to talk to you.

21:37.319 --> 21:40.729
Step out here for a minute, will you?

21:42.575 --> 21:44.492
You really think
she stumbled onto something?

21:44.493 --> 21:46.703
Well, it sure got the feds' attention.

21:46.704 --> 21:50.224
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

21:51.208 --> 21:53.084
I have heard of torture in Russia,

21:53.085 --> 21:55.461
but I never saw a man
with wires in his head.

21:55.462 --> 21:57.672
Yuri, it was awful.

21:57.673 --> 22:00.258
But I guess everything
will be okay now.

22:00.259 --> 22:03.845
So MacGyver says you're a real Iive
honest-to-goodness poet.

22:03.846 --> 22:05.805
Yes. This is so.

22:05.806 --> 22:08.808
I study acting
at a studio in the Valley.

22:08.809 --> 22:12.728
I don't know about this Valley,
but it sounds Iike we both are artists

22:12.729 --> 22:16.315
searching for the world that would
allow us to express ourselves.

22:16.316 --> 22:18.902
Yuri, that's so beautiful.

22:19.069 --> 22:23.030
No, it's dim compared
to the beauty of you.

22:23.031 --> 22:25.533
So how did you Iearn
to speak English so well?

22:25.534 --> 22:26.951
From American movies.

22:26.952 --> 22:29.036
Wait.

22:29.037 --> 22:31.414
Frankly, my dear...

22:31.415 --> 22:33.541
...I don't give a damn.

22:33.542 --> 22:35.960
That's really good.

22:35.961 --> 22:38.212
Can I impose
a small favour upon you?

22:38.213 --> 22:39.880
Sure.

22:39.881 --> 22:42.466
Now that I'II be Iiving
in the United States,

22:42.467 --> 22:45.886
I don't think name Yuri
is very red hot.

22:45.887 --> 22:47.972
I would Iike a new Western name.

22:47.973 --> 22:49.682
Can you help me to think of one?

22:49.683 --> 22:52.017
Of course. I'd Iove to.

22:52.018 --> 22:54.311
So when I called the DEA
to tell them what Penny saw,

22:54.312 --> 22:56.855
they ended up hiring the Foundation
to work on security

22:56.856 --> 22:58.482
for this Estevez press conference.

22:58.483 --> 23:00.067
Why are they so nervous?

23:00.068 --> 23:01.402
They Iost an agent.

23:01.403 --> 23:04.196
Their top man covering Estevez,
Robert Julian.

23:04.197 --> 23:05.406
Lost?

23:05.407 --> 23:08.617
Murdered. His body was found
in the Malibu hills this morning.

23:08.618 --> 23:12.079
He'd been tortured.
His eardrums were shattered.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.624
Well, that could connect to the guy
Penny saw with the earphones.

23:15.625 --> 23:18.752
Yeah. As soon as Larson's people
dig up that newsbreak tape,

23:18.753 --> 23:20.420
they're gonna wanna
go over it with her.

23:20.421 --> 23:22.422
How about Sean?

23:22.423 --> 23:25.050
No, you don't Iook Iike a Sean.

23:25.051 --> 23:28.011
Have you ever thought about Biff?

23:28.012 --> 23:31.431
- You Iike the name Biff?
- I Iove it.

23:31.432 --> 23:33.932
So Biff it will be.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.062
It is so good
you come at this minute.

23:37.063 --> 23:39.398
I have picked out
my new American name.

23:39.399 --> 23:40.941
It will be Biff.

23:40.942 --> 23:43.442
I gave him the idea.

23:44.987 --> 23:46.613
Has a nice ring to it.

23:46.614 --> 23:48.448
Yeah.

23:48.449 --> 23:50.784
Penny? You wanna go?

23:50.785 --> 23:52.786
Well, it was really nice talking to you.

23:52.787 --> 23:55.122
I hope to see you again soon.

23:55.123 --> 23:57.624
I don't think we'II ever see
each other again.

23:57.625 --> 24:00.215
I'II miss you, Penny Parker.

24:00.461 --> 24:01.795
Goodbye...

24:01.796 --> 24:04.296
...Biff.

24:14.475 --> 24:16.975
Biff?

24:20.481 --> 24:22.315
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

24:22.316 --> 24:26.444
The Phoenix Foundation thinks
the killer is already next to Estevez?

24:26.445 --> 24:27.821
According to Pete Thornton,

24:27.822 --> 24:30.657
the girl says the man
is part of Estevez's entourage.

24:30.658 --> 24:32.659
- But that's impossible.
- Is it?

24:32.660 --> 24:36.663
Is it also impossible for the one agent
we had close to the Estevez case

24:36.664 --> 24:38.206
to turn up dead?

24:38.207 --> 24:41.501
You're right, Mr. Larson,
we must find Julian's killer.

24:41.502 --> 24:43.586
Change the Iocation
of the press conference.

24:43.587 --> 24:47.632
And I want you to personally check
everyone that has access to Estevez,

24:47.633 --> 24:51.177
including your agents.
I want the man kept alive.

24:51.178 --> 24:52.679
Yes, sir. I'm right on it.

24:52.680 --> 24:56.516
And about this Thornton
at the Phoenix Foundation.

24:56.517 --> 24:59.060
He should have that girl
take a Iook at the newsbreak tape.

24:59.061 --> 25:00.687
It might give us a Iead.

25:00.688 --> 25:02.063
That's a great idea.

25:02.064 --> 25:04.774
I tell you,
this job is driving me crazy.

25:04.775 --> 25:07.318
Nervous clients,
weird chicks, nosy feds.

25:07.319 --> 25:10.029
You know, there's one weak Iink
in the whole operation, it's Derek.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.364
- Yeah.
- Corrupt cops,

25:11.365 --> 25:14.283
- you just can't depend on them.
- I tell you, it wouldn't make me upset

25:14.284 --> 25:16.494
if this is the Iast time
we work for them Colombians.

25:16.495 --> 25:18.871
- You're telling me.
- But their money's good.

25:18.872 --> 25:20.873
Derek, sorry to keep you waiting.

25:20.874 --> 25:22.333
Everything all set?

25:22.334 --> 25:24.377
Changed the Iocation to city hall.

25:24.378 --> 25:26.963
Make sure you don't get Iost.

25:26.964 --> 25:29.464
You know, the Parker girl

25:29.466 --> 25:32.760
saw me on the news Iast night
standing next to Estevez.

25:32.761 --> 25:34.345
We'II take care of her.

25:34.346 --> 25:35.554
Be sure you do.

25:35.555 --> 25:37.807
Just Iet us do our job, okay?

25:37.808 --> 25:39.767
Look, you two barbarians,

25:39.768 --> 25:41.936
I'm here because
the Colombian bosses needed me

25:41.937 --> 25:43.562
a Iot more than they needed you.

25:43.563 --> 25:46.649
Derek, baby, they own you.
You're their puppet.

25:46.650 --> 25:49.610
So just do your job
and plant that bomb.

25:49.611 --> 25:51.862
I'm already way ahead of you guys.

25:51.863 --> 25:53.614
I placed the bomb.

25:53.615 --> 25:55.366
I know what I'm doing.

25:55.367 --> 25:57.660
Terrific.

25:57.661 --> 26:00.913
Now we know what we gotta do.
Just Iike they told us.

26:00.914 --> 26:02.748
You think we should
give them a discount?

26:02.749 --> 26:05.629
No, he's been too much trouble.

26:13.259 --> 26:15.887
Do you wanna snuff the girl?

26:18.181 --> 26:19.932
Yeah.

26:19.933 --> 26:22.017
She reminds me
of that broad in CIeveland

26:22.018 --> 26:24.436
that stood me up once.

26:24.437 --> 26:27.023
It'd be a pleasure.

26:41.454 --> 26:43.455
I can't believe poor Yuri.

26:43.456 --> 26:46.583
You know, he hasn't had
a fresh vegetable in nine months.

26:46.584 --> 26:48.293
I guess we're pretty Iucky, huh?

26:48.294 --> 26:50.838
Yep, I guess we are.

26:52.215 --> 26:54.257
I'm really sorry, MacGyver.

26:54.258 --> 26:57.219
Don't worry about it. I can fix it.

26:57.220 --> 26:59.054
No, it's not just that.

26:59.055 --> 27:01.389
I mean, it seems Iike
I'm always popping into your Iife

27:01.390 --> 27:04.309
at the worst possible moment
and dragging you into something.

27:04.310 --> 27:06.937
Well, it's not Iike
you go out Iooking for trouble.

27:06.938 --> 27:09.022
It just seems to find you.

27:09.023 --> 27:11.691
And I think that's a direct result
of caring too much,

27:11.692 --> 27:13.985
which is not a bad thing.

27:13.986 --> 27:16.112
You really mean that?

27:16.113 --> 27:18.613
Yeah, I really mean that.

27:21.077 --> 27:23.577
Come on.

27:26.374 --> 27:28.208
So do you think
that the men that I saw

27:28.209 --> 27:29.667
are involved in this drug thing?

27:29.668 --> 27:32.168
Gotta be.

27:38.010 --> 27:40.510
Hello.

27:40.721 --> 27:44.016
Yeah. Yeah, she is.
Hang on.

27:44.183 --> 27:46.643
- It's for you.
- Oh, thanks.

27:46.644 --> 27:48.019
Hello.

27:48.020 --> 27:49.562
Yeah.

27:49.563 --> 27:52.066
I do? That's great!

27:52.233 --> 27:54.442
When?

27:54.443 --> 27:57.153
That only gives me
half an hour.

27:57.154 --> 27:58.988
Yeah, I understand.

27:58.989 --> 28:01.449
Okay. Thanks, bye.

28:01.450 --> 28:03.701
I got it! I got it!

28:03.702 --> 28:06.412
- Got what?
- I got my first commercial audition.

28:06.413 --> 28:08.289
For Carob dishwashing detergent.

28:08.290 --> 28:09.999
You know,
the soap that Ieaves your hands

28:10.000 --> 28:12.919
- as soft as a rose petal.
- That's terrific. Congratulations.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.504
Thanks.

28:14.505 --> 28:16.839
Well, tell me to break a Ieg.

28:16.840 --> 28:20.170
Well, Penny, you can't go out there.

28:20.552 --> 28:23.052
Why not?

28:25.265 --> 28:27.558
- Who is it?
- Biff.

28:27.559 --> 28:30.059
- Who?
- Yuri Demetri.

28:30.562 --> 28:32.438
- Hi.
- Yuri, what are you doing here?

28:32.439 --> 28:34.231
I've come to spend
my Iast minutes in L.A.

28:34.232 --> 28:35.733
protecting Penny Parker.

28:35.734 --> 28:37.485
You're such a doll, Biff.

28:37.486 --> 28:40.655
Bi-- Yuri, how did you get out
of Thornton's office?

28:40.656 --> 28:42.907
I was Iooking for the men's room,
I took the wrong turn

28:42.908 --> 28:45.409
and found myself outside.
So I decided it could work for me.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.244
Oh, great. I'm taking you back.

28:47.245 --> 28:48.579
And you're staying right here.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.831
You can't keep me here
against my will.

28:50.832 --> 28:53.292
She is right.
Penny Parker is a free citizen

28:53.293 --> 28:54.877
of United States of America.

28:54.878 --> 28:57.922
We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

28:57.923 --> 29:01.259
that all women are created equal.

29:01.718 --> 29:03.093
Yuri, you stay out of this.

29:03.094 --> 29:04.929
Call me Biff, please.

29:04.930 --> 29:07.056
You know, this is
the most important day of my Iife,

29:07.057 --> 29:09.016
- and you're about to ruin it for me.
- Hold it!

29:09.017 --> 29:10.768
Everyone just hold it right here.

29:10.769 --> 29:13.269
Hold what?

29:14.272 --> 29:16.772
Hello! Sorry, Pete.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.485
You're not gonna believe this.
Yuri is missing.

29:19.486 --> 29:21.653
I know. He's right here.

29:21.654 --> 29:23.238
Well, what's he doing there?

29:23.239 --> 29:25.739
Looking for the bathroom.

29:27.202 --> 29:30.079
You two wait for me downstairs.

29:31.581 --> 29:33.081
I'm sorry, Pete, what'd you say?

29:33.082 --> 29:36.877
I said, do you want me to send
the Iimo over for Yuri?

29:36.878 --> 29:39.338
So I'm real excited
about going to this audition.

29:39.339 --> 29:40.714
I think I'm gonna get it.

29:40.715 --> 29:42.633
- Can I come with you? To Iook?
- I don't know.

29:42.634 --> 29:44.676
- Nice to see you again.
- Shut up. Get in the van.

29:44.677 --> 29:46.428
- Who are you?
- You just get in the van.

29:46.429 --> 29:48.513
You guys are the guys
I saw in the garage.

29:48.514 --> 29:50.098
In the back. In the back.

29:50.099 --> 29:52.184
What do you want?

29:52.185 --> 29:54.978
Well, come by here first.
I've got that newsbreak tape.

29:54.979 --> 29:56.730
Maybe she can identify that guy.

29:56.731 --> 30:00.511
Yeah, all right, fine.
We're on our way.

30:07.325 --> 30:09.326
Just what is this all about?

30:09.327 --> 30:10.577
Would you shut her up?

30:10.578 --> 30:13.038
Drive the truck, Lyle.
I'II take care of the girl.

30:13.039 --> 30:15.207
MacGyver, help!

30:15.208 --> 30:16.625
MacGyver!

30:16.626 --> 30:19.126
MacGyver-- !

30:43.027 --> 30:46.727
Just keep quiet
and you won't get hurt.

30:46.781 --> 30:53.031
The problem was to follow them
without their knowing I was following.

30:57.791 --> 31:00.209
It's not easy
tracking somebody in traffic,

31:00.210 --> 31:03.730
especially when
they get a head start.

31:16.060 --> 31:17.852
MacGyver's gonna come after us.

31:17.853 --> 31:20.396
He's really terrific,
and he's gonna find us.

31:20.397 --> 31:23.274
Then he can help with the burial.
Now, shut up!

31:23.275 --> 31:25.775
Burial?

31:34.661 --> 31:36.287
I had to stay back far enough

31:36.288 --> 31:39.123
so they wouldn't spot me
and try to lose me.

31:39.124 --> 31:41.624
So they lost me.

31:47.591 --> 31:50.091
Momentarily.

32:00.437 --> 32:02.021
As Patrick Henry once said,

32:02.022 --> 32:05.774
and I quote,
"Give me Iiberty or give me death."

32:05.775 --> 32:07.568
I vote for death.

32:07.569 --> 32:10.069
Yuri.

32:23.626 --> 32:27.212
Look, I understand you undoubtedly
had a deprived childhood,

32:27.213 --> 32:29.715
but this is a rotten way
to act out your hostilities.

32:29.716 --> 32:31.300
You want a sock
stuffed in your mouth?

32:31.301 --> 32:33.801
- No.
- Then keep it shut.

32:47.901 --> 32:49.818
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

32:49.819 --> 32:52.488
- Right.
- Move it. Move it!

34:00.848 --> 34:02.515
Why are you doing this?

34:02.516 --> 34:04.809
I mean, we didn't do anything.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.562
I mean, my friend's
only been in America two days.

34:07.563 --> 34:09.563
What kind of impression
do you think this makes?

34:09.565 --> 34:11.524
Lyle, we better hurry up.

34:11.525 --> 34:14.444
We don't get into city hall with the
cleaning crew at 4, we don't get in.

34:14.445 --> 34:17.112
Relax. Did you ever know anything
to be on time at city hall?

34:17.114 --> 34:20.408
No, but if we wanna stay alive,
I suggest we be first.

34:20.409 --> 34:23.245
Move it. Move it.

34:23.411 --> 34:24.911
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

34:24.913 --> 34:26.539
You're the one
got your friend into this.

34:26.540 --> 34:28.416
If you hadn't been noseying around
our garage--

34:28.417 --> 34:30.376
I promise I'm not gonna talk.

34:30.377 --> 34:33.839
Sweetheart, you do nothing but talk.

35:00.157 --> 35:01.824
I can't believe this.

35:01.825 --> 35:04.452
I mean, I have a chance to do
my first national commercial

35:04.453 --> 35:07.746
for new and improved
Carob dishwashing detergent.

35:07.747 --> 35:11.292
And if I don't get to my audition,
my career could be ruined.

35:11.293 --> 35:14.253
You ain't gonna be washing
many dishes where you're going.

35:14.254 --> 35:15.588
Where am I going?

35:15.589 --> 35:18.091
We're putting you on ice.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.094
Nice, Lyle.

35:22.095 --> 35:24.888
- You got it real cool in there.
- Yeah.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.057
But I don't Iike the cold.

35:27.058 --> 35:30.144
I mean, my Iips turn blue
and my nose starts running.

35:30.145 --> 35:32.146
Don't be afraid, Penny Parker,
I'II be with you.

35:32.147 --> 35:33.731
AII right, get in there.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.232
Come on.

35:36.693 --> 35:39.193
Yeah, sure.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.491
How Iong you think
it'II take them to freeze?

35:44.492 --> 35:47.077
Well, it took Derek 20 minutes.

35:47.078 --> 35:51.228
Yeah, but he don't count.
We shot him first.

36:34.542 --> 36:37.042
What is it?

37:06.824 --> 37:09.409
Brute strength
wasn't gonna get them out of there.

37:09.410 --> 37:11.411
Not with this lock.

37:11.412 --> 37:13.621
And at 20 degrees below zero,

37:13.622 --> 37:18.252
a lot of things
start happening to the human body.

37:33.016 --> 37:34.767
I had maybe ten or 15 minutes

37:34.768 --> 37:38.818
before they'd go into
low-temperature shock.

37:41.483 --> 37:43.526
Funny place for a wheelchair,

37:43.527 --> 37:47.572
especially one that looks like
it's been blown up.

37:47.573 --> 37:50.116
But I could use some of the pieces.

37:50.117 --> 37:53.578
Especially these
magnesium wheels.

37:57.624 --> 38:01.774
I've never been this cold
in my entire Iife.

38:01.795 --> 38:06.298
Oh, it's nothing compared
to the winter in Russia.

38:06.299 --> 38:07.758
Really?

38:07.759 --> 38:10.971
It's really colder in Russia?

38:11.805 --> 38:15.005
No, actually it's much colder here.

38:15.225 --> 38:16.725
We're gonna die, aren't we?

38:16.726 --> 38:18.185
No, no, no, no.

38:18.186 --> 38:19.436
Keep moving.

38:19.437 --> 38:22.367
We'II stay warm. We'II be okay.

38:23.358 --> 38:24.858
Wait.

38:24.859 --> 38:28.959
The warmth of your smile
Iights up my heart.

38:30.156 --> 38:32.616
That's so beautiful.

38:32.617 --> 38:35.117
It is, isn't it?

38:52.262 --> 38:53.846
Magnesium alloy.

38:53.847 --> 38:56.765
Comes in real handy
for heating things fast,

38:56.766 --> 39:01.026
especially if it's tucked inside
an iron pipe.

39:02.689 --> 39:05.065
You start with some old rags
for wadding,

39:05.066 --> 39:08.777
just like loading
one of those frontier muskets.

39:08.778 --> 39:10.195
Difference is

39:10.196 --> 39:13.365
this musket was still
in the process of being invented.

39:13.366 --> 39:15.200
The barrel wasn't forged,

39:15.201 --> 39:17.494
the breech didn't exist,

39:17.495 --> 39:20.665
and I wanted it to burn, not blow.

39:23.334 --> 39:28.444
This magnesium didn't give me
any guarantees either way.

39:41.143 --> 39:43.896
Penny Parker, why so quiet?

39:44.438 --> 39:48.442
I think my tongue's frozen.

39:49.068 --> 39:51.568
Keep moving it.

39:53.114 --> 39:55.990
Basic law of physics says
that when something gets hot,

39:55.991 --> 39:57.867
it expands.

39:57.868 --> 40:02.247
In fancy terms it's called the
coefficient of volumetric expansion.

40:02.248 --> 40:04.332
Or, to put it more simply:

40:04.333 --> 40:06.833
What gets hot, gets bigger.

40:06.836 --> 40:09.964
And hopefully pops the lock open.

40:36.323 --> 40:37.657
Hi.

40:37.658 --> 40:39.117
How did you...?

40:39.118 --> 40:41.786
- Where did you...?
- We almost froze to death.

40:41.787 --> 40:45.331
If you hadn't saved us, we would
have been a couple of Popsicles.

40:45.332 --> 40:49.126
Yes. It's Iike you say,
almost cooked gooses.

40:49.127 --> 40:50.962
Yeah, right.
Just keep moving, okay?

40:50.963 --> 40:52.880
Keep yourself moving.

40:52.881 --> 40:55.383
Those men, they were really awful.

40:55.384 --> 40:57.677
They killed that man I saw on TV.

40:57.678 --> 40:59.470
He's in there, with the fish.

40:59.471 --> 41:01.138
Penny, these really awful men,

41:01.139 --> 41:04.517
did they happen to say
where they were going?

41:04.518 --> 41:07.520
They said something about
city hall at 4.

41:07.521 --> 41:09.814
Yes, and they are part
of the cleaning crew.

41:09.815 --> 41:13.109
Yeah, something tells me
they don't do windows.

41:13.110 --> 41:15.569
I wish I knew what they were up to.

41:15.570 --> 41:19.120
Voice activation test.
One, two, three.

41:19.199 --> 41:20.491
You see that, Vince?

41:20.492 --> 41:23.202
When we get that tape recording
with Estevez talking...

41:23.203 --> 41:25.454
- What is this?
- ...got this baby so it reacts only--

41:25.455 --> 41:28.374
Looks Iike some kind of
detonating device.

41:28.375 --> 41:30.501
And it seems to be voice-activated.

41:30.502 --> 41:31.961
For a bomb?

41:31.962 --> 41:33.671
Yeah, a bomb.

41:33.672 --> 41:35.047
They're gonna kill Estevez,

41:35.048 --> 41:37.007
and they're gonna use
his own voice to do it.

41:37.008 --> 41:39.508
At city hall. Come on.

41:57.278 --> 41:59.655
Mr. Estevez, I'm Peter Thornton,
handling security.

41:59.656 --> 42:03.836
Would you go right in, please?
Stay with him.

42:05.453 --> 42:07.953
Okay.

42:08.498 --> 42:10.998
Okay.

42:12.210 --> 42:15.171
Okay. They're all clear.

42:26.849 --> 42:28.225
Good afternoon, Mr. Larson.

42:28.226 --> 42:30.060
My people have been over
the whole building.

42:30.061 --> 42:33.063
- Security's tight as a drum.
- Good. Good work, Thornton.

42:33.064 --> 42:35.440
I'm concerned about
my number one man, Derek, though.

42:35.441 --> 42:38.068
He's not here,
he hasn't reported in,

42:38.069 --> 42:40.569
and that's not Iike him.

43:01.092 --> 43:02.467
We don't need these guns.

43:02.468 --> 43:05.804
The bomb's gonna blow just fine,
and we'II make a nice, clean getaway.

43:05.805 --> 43:09.474
Maybe you're right,
but I just Iike having a Iittle insurance.

43:09.475 --> 43:11.768
You mean
if Mr. Estevez begins speaking,

43:11.769 --> 43:13.186
he'II be killed?

43:13.187 --> 43:16.147
Yeah, along with everyone else
within 50 feet of the bomb.

43:16.148 --> 43:18.274
Oh, my gosh.

43:18.275 --> 43:21.444
Let's move it.
We got five minutes to set up.

43:21.445 --> 43:23.948
Okay, Iet's go.

43:55.270 --> 43:57.770
Over there.

44:13.830 --> 44:16.791
I know we've been over the whole
building, but I want you to check again.

44:16.792 --> 44:18.417
- Every exit and every entran--
- Pete!

44:18.418 --> 44:20.669
That's all right. They're with me.
Where have you been?

44:20.670 --> 44:22.171
- We're Iooking for a bomb.
- A bomb?

44:22.172 --> 44:24.507
Someone's after Estevez.
We don't have much time.

44:24.508 --> 44:27.051
Call headquarters. Get a bomb squad
down here right away.

44:27.052 --> 44:28.719
You two wait here.

44:28.720 --> 44:31.055
I don't know how anyone
could have gotten a bomb in here.

44:31.056 --> 44:32.348
Does a wheelchair make sense?

44:32.349 --> 44:34.850
John Larson uses a wheelchair.
I walked him in myself.

44:34.851 --> 44:37.144
It's gonna blow as soon as
Estevez opens his mouth.

44:37.145 --> 44:39.772
- It's voice-activated. Where is he?
- Upstairs.

44:39.773 --> 44:41.690
Estevez will be standing
right next to Larson

44:41.691 --> 44:43.525
when the bomb goes off.

44:43.526 --> 44:45.319
MacGyver saved me twice.

44:45.320 --> 44:48.700
It's time I help MacGyver. Let's go.

44:49.282 --> 44:50.741
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

44:50.742 --> 44:53.368
Mr. Estevez's appearance
here this afternoon

44:53.369 --> 44:57.581
signals a new Ievel of cooperation
between our two countries.

44:57.582 --> 44:59.666
Now, before you ask any questions,

44:59.667 --> 45:02.419
Mr. Estevez would Iike to make
a brief statement

45:02.420 --> 45:07.382
regarding his appearance before
the grand jury Iater this afternoon.

45:07.383 --> 45:09.883
Mr. Estevez.

45:12.055 --> 45:14.555
Excuse me.

45:15.558 --> 45:17.267
Don't Iet him say a word!

45:17.268 --> 45:19.728
It's a voice-activated bomb!

45:19.729 --> 45:22.229
Take him out, now!

45:25.568 --> 45:27.736
I can't get a clean shot.

45:27.737 --> 45:30.237
Look! A gun!

45:41.250 --> 45:43.418
- Get him. Okay, buddy.
- Hold it!

45:43.419 --> 45:46.589
- It's all over.
- No, you don't.

45:49.759 --> 45:51.593
Yuri.

45:51.594 --> 45:54.094
Do you feel Iucky?

46:00.102 --> 46:03.012
Make room. CIear it, bomb squad.

46:09.820 --> 46:12.620
AII right, get it out of here.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.702
AII in a day's work, huh?

46:17.912 --> 46:19.454
AII right, move it!

46:19.455 --> 46:20.872
Okay, make way. CIear the exit.

46:20.873 --> 46:23.291
- Come on! Move it!

46:23.292 --> 46:25.892
- Coming through.

46:26.003 --> 46:28.713

- Yeah, fine.

46:28.714 --> 46:31.549
Listen, thanks. It was good work.

46:31.550 --> 46:34.510
Yeah, actually,
the credit goes to Penny.

46:34.511 --> 46:36.429
And Biff.

46:36.430 --> 46:39.390
And, Iisten, I'm really sorry
I got you all into this.

46:39.391 --> 46:40.683
Don't you worry.

46:40.684 --> 46:42.977
This is work Dirty Harry
couldn't have done better.

46:42.978 --> 46:44.562
Dirty Harry?

46:44.563 --> 46:46.981
Yuri Ioves American cinema.

46:46.982 --> 46:50.777
But if Iife in America's Iike this,
who needs the movies?

46:50.778 --> 46:52.153
It's true.

46:52.154 --> 46:53.988
AII you really need is...

46:53.989 --> 46:56.489
...Penny Parker.
