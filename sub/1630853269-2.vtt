'The following programme
contains strong language

00:04.200 --> 00:07.200
and scenes which some viewers
may find distressing.'

00:17.280 --> 00:19.080
'My daughter
hasn't come home.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.080
Her name's Neve Kelly.
She's 19.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.880
She always comes home.
It doesn't feel right.'

00:23.920 --> 00:24.000
Fuck's sake! I'm right here!

00:24.000 --> 00:26.520
Fuck's sake! I'm right here!

00:27.960 --> 00:31.360
There's something in the water.
Get her out! Get her out!

00:31.400 --> 00:32.000
No!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.400
No!

00:33.440 --> 00:34.880
Neve.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.000
Dad. Can you see me?

00:40.000 --> 00:40.400
Dad. Can you see me?

00:41.760 --> 00:43.360
Dad, stop!

00:56.360 --> 00:58.440
Stop staring at me like that.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.800
Th... This shouldn't be happening.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.160
I mean, it's not possible.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.000
You died.

01:04.000 --> 01:04.800
You died.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.080
You should've died twice.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.760
You're no good to me
when you're like this.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.840
Does it feel...different?

01:38.040 --> 01:40.040
I'm not thirsty or...

01:40.760 --> 01:42.440
..hungry...

01:43.520 --> 01:44.000
..or tired.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.600
..or tired.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.000
Neve...

01:52.000 --> 01:52.360
Neve...

01:54.440 --> 01:56.680
..what happened to you last night?

01:57.840 --> 01:59.840
Some kind of accident, right?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.600
I had bruises.

02:07.880 --> 02:08.000
And a cut like...

02:08.000 --> 02:09.880
And a cut like...

02:12.120 --> 02:14.960
..I'd been hit with something.
Jesus Christ.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.360
I can't remember details.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.520
The last few days, it's like my...

02:23.600 --> 02:24.000
..my memory's in pieces.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
..my memory's in pieces.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.080
What was I doing last night
at the party?

02:31.320 --> 02:32.000
Who was I with?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.080
Who was I with?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.640
I-I saw you by the fire and...

02:39.200 --> 02:40.000
..you actually spoke to me,
which was...a novelty.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.880
..you actually spoke to me,
which was...a novelty.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.000
You seemed sad.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.880
You seemed sad.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.000
And then you were off dancing
and I didn't see you after that.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.360
And then you were off dancing
and I didn't see you after that.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.360
I-I was...

03:00.680 --> 03:02.600
I can't deal with this right now.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.000
I-I just...

03:04.000 --> 03:04.840
I-I just...

03:04.880 --> 03:07.440
I just need to be on my own
for a bit.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.000
Fine.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.840
Fine.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.240
But I'm not going away.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.400
Not till I figure out
who did this to me.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.600
there's no better days

04:32.400 --> 04:35.760
until I'm scared of day

05:10.240 --> 05:12.000
I understand.
But we're doing everything we can.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.400
I understand.
But we're doing everything we can.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.000
Sorry.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.800
Sorry.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.200
OK.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.080
Which one?
Uh, the first one.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.000
Three, two, one. There we go.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.800
Three, two, one. There we go.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.920
Go on, then. Ah!
Don't touch the hot bit.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.000
There's a ligature mark
around her neck.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.120
There's a ligature mark
around her neck.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.080
And this indentation...

08:46.280 --> 08:48.000
..looks like a belt buckle to me.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.680
..looks like a belt buckle to me.

08:51.920 --> 08:56.000
There's something embedded...
at the site of the ligature mark.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.200
There's something embedded...
at the site of the ligature mark.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.360
What is it?

09:01.200 --> 09:04.000
Paint? Metal, perhaps.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.080
Paint? Metal, perhaps.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.320
We'll know more after analysis.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.960
Right. Let's open her up.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.000
They're always doing that, right?

09:20.000 --> 09:20.440
They're always doing that, right?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.680
Actually, no.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.040
Um, Maria wasn't answering
her phone.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.280
I was worried.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.240
Doctor gave her a sedative.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.120
Want a cup of tea?

10:30.120 --> 10:32.000
Where do you think we go
when we die?

10:32.000 --> 10:32.480
Where do you think we go
when we die?

10:38.760 --> 10:40.000
I don't think we go anywhere, Tom.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.240
I don't think we go anywhere, Tom.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.040
I think this is it...

10:47.240 --> 10:48.000
..and we have to make
the most of what we have.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.680
..and we have to make
the most of what we have.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.760
I think that's the point.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.960
When Maria's mum died,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.360
she just powered on through.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.840
I think that made it worse.
Don't worry.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.000
I'll look after her.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.360
I'll look after her.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.000
The police have asked us to do
a formal identification...tomorrow.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.080
The police have asked us to do
a formal identification...tomorrow.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.000
Do you want to come with us?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.280
Do you want to come with us?

11:32.120 --> 11:34.120
I think I've seen enough.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.120
Death by strangulation...

11:43.160 --> 11:44.000
confirmed by
the fractured hyoid bone.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.400
confirmed by
the fractured hyoid bone.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.560
The perpetrator used a belt,

11:47.600 --> 11:50.720
although there's also blunt force
trauma to the back of the head.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.000
She was dead
prior to entering the water.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.720
She was dead
prior to entering the water.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.800
And no sign of sexual assault.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.160
Uh, toxicology results
are on the system.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.000
Um... Let's see.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.320
Decent amount of alcohol.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.000
80 milligrams.

12:08.000 --> 12:08.400
80 milligrams.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.440
And GHB.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.360
Recreational? Or was she drugged?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.000
She might have taken it willingly...

12:16.000 --> 12:16.680
She might have taken it willingly...

12:16.720 --> 12:19.080
I didn't.
..but nine times out of ten,

12:19.120 --> 12:20.920
in a scenario like this,

12:20.960 --> 12:23.160
the victim
had the substance administered

12:23.200 --> 12:24.000
without their knowledge.

12:24.000 --> 12:24.680
without their knowledge.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.800
That's your lot.
We'll tidy her up

12:27.840 --> 12:30.680
and she'll be ready
for identification in the morning.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.880
Get some sleep.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.320
You, too.
And, uh, thanks for the um...

13:01.760 --> 13:03.480
You OK?
Yeah.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.000
Just, um... Just tired.
Yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.520
Just, um... Just tired.
Yeah.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.360
Night.
Night, Tom.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.040
Where have you been?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.200
Come here.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.120
Did you find out anything more
about what happened to you?

13:43.800 --> 13:44.000
And DID you take GHB last night?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.360
And DID you take GHB last night?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.240
No.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.000
That's what I'm saying.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.000
Someone drugged me...

13:52.000 --> 13:52.920
Someone drugged me...

13:53.840 --> 13:56.240
..and then strangled me with a belt.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.800
I wouldn't have taken GHB
out of choice.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.000
And I'd only take a drink
from someone I trusted.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.240
And I'd only take a drink
from someone I trusted.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.520
Dad, this was someone I know.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.240
How are you?

14:36.920 --> 14:39.080
What you drinking?
Beer. I don't know.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.000
It was given to me.
Down. Down.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.800
It was given to me.
Down. Down.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.360
I'll make that.
It's OK. Do you want one?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.560
Sure.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I'll get it.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.680
Maria, is this your daughter,
Neve Kelly?

16:23.960 --> 16:24.000
Yeah, it's Neve.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.600
Yeah, it's Neve.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.000
Can I...

16:37.760 --> 16:39.760
Can I touch her?

17:05.440 --> 17:07.520
Goodbye, sweetheart.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.760
They loved you so much, you idiot.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.920
I need your computer.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.840
What for?

18:08.920 --> 18:12.560
Um... I was just trying
to understand.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.000
We need to find
photos from the party.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.440
We need to find
photos from the party.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.600
See who else was there, who
I might have been hanging out with.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Did you see your mum?
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.360
Did you see your mum?
Yeah.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.840
How is she?

18:27.880 --> 18:30.040
How do you think?

18:32.640 --> 18:35.920
Having you to myself, it...
it's not fair.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.000
That website, it talks about
this multiverse theory -

18:40.000 --> 18:42.120
That website, it talks about
this multiverse theory -

18:42.160 --> 18:44.560
like, maybe when you die,

18:44.600 --> 18:48.000
you live on in other realities
that run in parallel.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.040
you live on in other realities
that run in parallel.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.040
You think
that's what happened to you?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.560
I don't know.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.560
Cheer up.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.000
Forget the race. Drink.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.320
Forget the race. Drink.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.000
Write down names. Anyone you can
remember from the party.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.720
Write down names. Anyone you can
remember from the party.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.800
Why? Where are you going?
The club.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.360
'Neve Kelly down the back straight,
chasing the leader.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.000
Kelly's pushing hard now.'

19:36.000 --> 19:38.080
Kelly's pushing hard now.'

19:44.880 --> 19:46.560
'Kelly's trying to make a move

19:46.600 --> 19:49.680
as we come into the forest section.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.000
Neve Kelly on 44 is about to make
a pass on the inside line!

19:52.000 --> 19:53.240
Neve Kelly on 44 is about to make
a pass on the inside line!

19:53.280 --> 19:55.600
She's coming through.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.280
Oh, and they come together
and both riders go down!'

19:58.320 --> 19:59.520
Neve!

20:02.560 --> 20:06.760
'Looks like both riders are down.
Can we have the paramedics, please?'

20:09.400 --> 20:11.000
Neve?

20:13.160 --> 20:14.320
Neve!?

20:15.160 --> 20:16.000
I'm OK.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.920
I'm OK.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.240
I'm OK.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.000
Yeah, but, Nicky, I keep telling you
to keep your weight forward.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.440
Yeah, but, Nicky, I keep telling you
to keep your weight forward.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.400
What am I meant to do with that?
Sparkle.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.000
Go on, then. Ah!

21:28.000 --> 21:29.800
Go on, then. Ah!

21:52.840 --> 21:54.960
Didn't think you'd be in today.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.680
I want to keep busy.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.440
So, how are you?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.440
Good.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.960
No... Like, how are you?

22:24.280 --> 22:27.880
I saw this, um, this documentary,

22:28.640 --> 22:30.800
and the thing is,
you should always ask twice.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.000
First time's just small talk.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.640
First time's just small talk.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.320
Second time's the important one.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.200
You know, the honest one.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.560
So, how are you?

22:43.800 --> 22:45.760
I can't stop thinking about her.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.000
Boys.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.000
Police are taking statements
down at the station.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.040
Police are taking statements
down at the station.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.080
You should both go get it over with.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.720
I'll go after practice.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.280
You don't need to practise today,
Joseph.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.000
I need to keep busy.

23:04.000 --> 23:04.200
I need to keep busy.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.920
Did you two see or hear
anything at the party

23:07.960 --> 23:10.360
that might help the police?

23:12.040 --> 23:14.480
I dunno.
Well, think.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.760
Don't you want to catch
whoever did this to Neve?

23:16.800 --> 23:18.200
Course I do.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.000
Uh, he was out of it. We both were.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.080
Uh, he was out of it. We both were.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.040
When did you see her last?

23:26.880 --> 23:28.000
I don't know about times.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.480
I don't know about times.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.600
But we talked, then she went off.
Went to get some food, maybe.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.000
That's all I remember.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.720
That's all I remember.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.560
I drank too much.

23:40.800 --> 23:43.240
I guess I walked home
and went to sleep.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.800
And you?

23:46.840 --> 23:50.000
Uh, same. Except I crashed
in Raff's tent, so...

23:51.440 --> 23:52.000
If I could go back
and change things, I would.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.880
If I could go back
and change things, I would.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.320
I'd be there for her.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.000
We're all feeling that, Joseph.
But you're not alone, OK?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.640
We're all feeling that, Joseph.
But you're not alone, OK?

24:01.680 --> 24:03.080
Remember that.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.280
Neve was one of us.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.320
And we loved her.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.000
Get the statements done today,
all right?

24:16.000 --> 24:16.880
Get the statements done today,
all right?

24:29.920 --> 24:32.000
So we're sticking to that story?

24:32.000 --> 24:32.400
So we're sticking to that story?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.160
Yeah.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.000
Who the fuck did it?
I already gave a statement.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.680
Who the fuck did it?
I already gave a statement.

24:57.720 --> 25:01.840
Told them everything I know -
which is pretty much jack shit.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.000
I still don't believe it. Why would
someone do something like that?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.120
I still don't believe it. Why would
someone do something like that?

25:05.160 --> 25:07.640
You never know
who you live next door to, mate.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.680
They could come for you next.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.120
Piss off.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.000
Hey, turn that up!

25:12.000 --> 25:12.800
Hey, turn that up!

25:13.960 --> 25:17.000
'We can confirm
that Neve was killed

25:17.040 --> 25:19.480
in the very early hours
of Sunday morning...

25:20.360 --> 25:23.120
..and are appealing
for witnesses to come forward.

25:23.160 --> 25:27.520
We're asking that anyone who
attended the party make contact

25:27.560 --> 25:28.000
as soon as possible so that we can
rule them out of our enquiries.'

25:28.000 --> 25:31.600
as soon as possible so that we can
rule them out of our enquiries.'

25:35.720 --> 25:36.000
'I just want to know
who did this to my daughter.'

25:36.000 --> 25:38.360
'I just want to know
who did this to my daughter.'

25:39.880 --> 25:44.000
Neve was a talented Motocross rider
and a promising artist.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.080
Neve was a talented Motocross rider
and a promising artist.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.760
And a wonderful person,
with so many reasons to live...

25:53.040 --> 25:55.040
..so many people who loved her.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.400
'If you can help...

25:59.440 --> 26:00.000
if you have any information,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.240
if you have any information,

26:01.280 --> 26:05.080
then please, please,
contact the police.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Please.'

26:08.000 --> 26:08.880
Please.'

26:10.680 --> 26:12.680
I'm begging you.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.000
Who do you reckon did it?

26:16.000 --> 26:16.920
Who do you reckon did it?

26:16.960 --> 26:19.040
I didn't see YOU
after that hot dog incident.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.040
We should get down to the station.
Yeah.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.200
I was with Amber.
Do you want to go together?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.000
In your fucking dreams, you were!
No. Thanks.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.320
In your fucking dreams, you were!
No. Thanks.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.880
Dad won't let my sister
go out on her own.
They might be here.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.520
Ain't gonna be nobody we know.
Get away from me.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.400
Just back off.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.800
Neve.
Back off!

27:41.680 --> 27:44.000
I was about to come looking for you.
I was worried.

27:44.000 --> 27:44.680
I was about to come looking for you.
I was worried.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.200
That's a first.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.600
You look terrible.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.000
Cheers.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.080
Cheers.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.000
Did you find anything out?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.640
Did you find anything out?

28:02.320 --> 28:06.280
Nicky's hiding something...
and Joseph's covering for him.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.360
Maybe the whole club's in on it.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.960
But they're your mates.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.920
Something happened.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.840
It was like...everyone vanished...

28:32.960 --> 28:34.960
..and I was alone.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.520
It felt like
I was going to be alone forever.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.440
Neve...

28:43.480 --> 28:45.200
you've been traumatised.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.000
You might never remember
what happened.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.360
You might never remember
what happened.

28:51.320 --> 28:55.000
You should just let the police
get on with it

28:55.040 --> 28:56.000
cos...this is not good for you.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.480
cos...this is not good for you.

28:59.960 --> 29:02.760
Since when were you
an expert on what's good for me?

29:09.480 --> 29:12.000
Did you make that list of people
who were at the party?

29:12.000 --> 29:12.080
Did you make that list of people
who were at the party?

29:12.120 --> 29:13.920
Yeah. It's over there.

29:20.040 --> 29:23.360
Neve, I... This is not OK,
what you're doing.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.680
Investigating your own murder,
I mean, that's a mind-fuck.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.000
I'm here for a reason, Dad, unless
you can think of a better one.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.160
I'm here for a reason, Dad, unless
you can think of a better one.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.960
I won't be somebody's victim.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.440
I mean, it's not right.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.840
Like, it'll...
it'll drive you crazy.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.760
I want justice. And I have
to understand what happened

29:43.800 --> 29:44.000
because if I don't,
I will go crazy.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.720
because if I don't,
I will go crazy.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.040
I think that's her.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.560
We were talking.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.000
It's one of the last things
I remember.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.880
It's one of the last things
I remember.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.720
She might've seen me with Nicky,
might have some idea what happened.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.000
Alex Wyatt.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.080
Alex Wyatt.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.760
God, is that her?

30:13.800 --> 30:15.640
I taught her when she was younger.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.360
Ah!

30:22.400 --> 30:24.000
No, don't touch the hot bit.

30:24.000 --> 30:24.720
No, don't touch the hot bit.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.320
Right.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.920
Ah, I remember now.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.320
You new here?
Not exactly.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.960
Environmentalist.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.400
Yeah.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.000
How's that going?

30:48.000 --> 30:48.320
How's that going?

30:48.360 --> 30:51.800
I work at the petrol station,
so not great.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
Right.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.000
I'll make sure it's her,
then you go question her.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.760
I'll make sure it's her,
then you go question her.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.760
Neve, I'm not a police officer.
This is...

31:15.800 --> 31:17.920
I need your fucking support, Dad!

31:17.960 --> 31:19.840
Just once.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.680
Um, hello?

32:01.360 --> 32:04.120
You kinda look like
you want something.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.000
Are you talking to me?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.640
Are you talking to me?

32:09.680 --> 32:11.800
Can't see anyone else here.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.600
I was kinda hoping
I'd see you again.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.720
Surprise.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.840
I waited around, you know.
The other night.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.080
Like a sad twat.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.000
Were we talking long?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.240
Were we talking long?

32:42.280 --> 32:44.600
It's nice to know I'm memorable.
No!

32:44.640 --> 32:46.640
I... No, I...

32:47.440 --> 32:48.000
I just... I can't, um...
can't remember much.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.360
I just... I can't, um...
can't remember much.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.800
Yeah, we talked.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.000
And we danced.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.240
And we danced.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.840
And we drank.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.880
And then you bailed.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.360
Are you OK?

33:08.560 --> 33:10.600
Don't ask me that.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.000
No, I am, though.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.480
No, I am, though.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.200
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.680
Did you see who else I was with?

33:32.720 --> 33:35.640
Um, yeah. You were talking
to one of the Motocross guys.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.000
Tall, dark hair.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.960
Tall, dark hair.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.760
Nicky.
Mm-hm. And then Joe came over

33:40.800 --> 33:42.960
and you went off together.
Just the two of you.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
That was the last time I saw you.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.920
That was the last time I saw you.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.520
Did you see where we went?

33:47.560 --> 33:49.200
Into the woods.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.280
I was kinda surprised.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.000
He didn't seem like your type.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.680
He didn't seem like your type.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.800
I gotta go.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.000
But it's dangerous round here.
You shouldn't be on your own.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.800
But it's dangerous round here.
You shouldn't be on your own.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.760
I'll be fine.
The sun's coming up.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.000
And I've got a staple gun
in there, so...

34:08.000 --> 34:08.280
And I've got a staple gun
in there, so...

34:24.160 --> 34:25.560
Let's go.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.480
Do you want me to talk to her?
It doesn't matter.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.360
But isn't that the whole reason -
She can see me, Dad.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.160
H-How is that even possible?
I don't know.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.000
She doesn't even know you.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.440
She doesn't even know you.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.680
Well...
maybe your mum can see you now.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.000
If... If other people can see you,
then it makes sense.

34:48.000 --> 34:48.240
If... If other people can see you,
then it makes sense.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.680
None of this makes sense, Dad.
I don't know.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.440
Just leave it.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.200
Maybe you won't need
to rely on me any more.

35:03.520 --> 35:04.000
Maybe.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.240
Maybe.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.080
Dan messaged.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.000
Wants me to go round.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.560
Wants me to go round.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.360
They're talking about a...vigil.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.000
They're including me in decisions.

35:20.000 --> 35:20.400
They're including me in decisions.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.920
It's nice.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.560
Yeah. You should go.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.640
Just drop me at the party field.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.080
Why?

35:34.840 --> 35:36.000
There's things I need to remember.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.080
There's things I need to remember.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.240
I'll meet you back at the house.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.960
Be careful.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.920
What's the worst that could happen?

36:16.640 --> 36:18.920
You OK?
Yeah. Why?

36:20.440 --> 36:23.560
I dunno. It's like you've been
avoiding me or something.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.480
If it's about the race -
It's not.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.440
Neve.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.680
Neve!

36:59.320 --> 37:00.920
Neve!

37:00.960 --> 37:03.000
Do I get the silent treatment?

37:04.600 --> 37:08.200
Neve, how am I meant to know
what to say to you when you won't
fucking talking to me?

37:08.240 --> 37:10.880
What do you want from me? From this?

37:12.320 --> 37:16.000
I just want YOU.
What, like...forever?

37:16.760 --> 37:18.760
Yeah.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.000
What's wrong with that?

37:20.000 --> 37:20.520
What's wrong with that?

37:20.560 --> 37:22.840
It's ridiculous.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.160
This isn't living,
this staying in Abbington

37:26.200 --> 37:28.000
with the same people
in the same place.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.200
with the same people
in the same place.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.840
W-We'll take a trip. Huh?

37:30.880 --> 37:33.960
We'll go travelling
at the end of next season. Fuck!

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Are you even listening to me?

37:36.000 --> 37:36.320
Are you even listening to me?

37:38.040 --> 37:40.360
There's nothing here for me.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.000
I'm here.

37:44.000 --> 37:44.520
I'm here.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.000
Are you dumping me?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.040
Are you dumping me?

37:56.120 --> 37:58.520
I'm in love with you.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.640
You're not thinking straight.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.680
You had an accident and you freaked
out and now you're talking shit.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.440
I don't want this anymore.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.800
You think you're better than me.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.000
You think I'm beneath you.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.280
You think I'm beneath you.

38:18.040 --> 38:22.120
No-one could ever be
good enough for you.
You're a fucking head case!

38:27.280 --> 38:29.360
All right, Joseph.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.000
You don't get to walk away from me.
Hey!

38:32.000 --> 38:33.280
You don't get to walk away from me.
Hey!

38:33.960 --> 38:36.200
Don't think this is over!

38:36.920 --> 38:38.960
'Do you hear me?!'

38:49.920 --> 38:53.320
These are amazing.
I thought we could carry them.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.000
Then, it'd be like she's with us.
Mm, that's a great idea.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.360
Then, it'd be like she's with us.
Mm, that's a great idea.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.320
Can you print some more?

38:59.360 --> 39:01.120
We'll hand them out.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.400
Can I help?

39:09.440 --> 39:11.200
No, it's OK..

39:15.280 --> 39:17.560
Don't you want to talk
about the vigil?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.000
A vigil's not gonna bring her back,
is it?

39:20.000 --> 39:20.240
A vigil's not gonna bring her back,
is it?

39:20.960 --> 39:23.280
I don't even know
where the idea came from.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.800
Suddenly, it's happening.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.360
Suddenly, everyone else in this town
gets to decide

39:27.400 --> 39:28.000
what we do about my daughter.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.320
what we do about my daughter.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.480
You know people loved her.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.800
I don't care
about other people right now.

39:33.840 --> 39:36.000
What they think, what they need -
I couldn't give a shit.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.880
What they think, what they need -
I couldn't give a shit.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.920
All I care about is Neve.

39:38.960 --> 39:43.800
All I want to know is why she's
lying in some cold fucking morgue

39:43.840 --> 39:44.000
when she should be upstairs in bed!

39:44.000 --> 39:46.920
when she should be upstairs in bed!

39:48.040 --> 39:49.800
It's fine. I-I'm fine.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.000
What?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.360
What?

40:03.960 --> 40:07.000
What if... What if I told you
that Neve's still here?

40:10.000 --> 40:13.400
I know it sounds crazy,
but she's not gone.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.000
I can see her, plain as day.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.040
I can see her, plain as day.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.360
I... She... She's been at my place.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.560
She's been here in this house.
Why are you saying this?

40:23.600 --> 40:24.000
Cos maybe you can see her, too,
if you just try.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.120
Cos maybe you can see her, too,
if you just try.

40:27.880 --> 40:31.000
You can come back to mine...
Oh! Oh, you've been drinking.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.000
No, no, no, no, no. I haven't.

40:32.000 --> 40:32.640
No, no, no, no, no. I haven't.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.400
I swear, like, this is the truth.

40:34.440 --> 40:39.960
I've stood over
our dead daughter's body!

40:40.000 --> 40:41.760
I know. I know.
Then what the fuck

40:41.800 --> 40:44.040
are you talking about?!
Just let me explain...

40:44.080 --> 40:46.160
No, you listen to me.
What's happened?

40:46.200 --> 40:48.000
Oh, apparently Neve's not dead.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.480
Oh, apparently Neve's not dead.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.440
No, that's not what I said.
I didn't...

40:50.480 --> 40:52.080
Get him out of my house!
No, Dan.

40:52.120 --> 40:54.320
Please. I'm not crazy.
Maria, let me finish...

40:54.360 --> 40:56.000
What the hell are you thinking?

40:56.000 --> 40:56.120
What the hell are you thinking?

40:56.160 --> 40:58.480
I'm not making it up. I...

40:58.520 --> 41:00.480
OK.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.640
But you've got to go.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.040
Where have you been?

42:39.080 --> 42:40.000
Out for a ride.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.200
Out for a ride.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.520
Did you do your statement yesterday?
Yep.

42:45.400 --> 42:48.000
Everything OK?
I just want to be alone.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.080
Everything OK?
I just want to be alone.
