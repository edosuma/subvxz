WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.369
(Knock at the door)

00:03.371 --> 00:05.104
- Morning!
-Hey! How are you?

00:05.106 --> 00:06.905
- Oh!
- Good morning!

00:06.907 --> 00:10.109
- Hi. Oh, just continue on
inside.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.410
- Well, I hope we didn't catch
the two of you

00:11.412 --> 00:13.912
with your pants down. (Laughs)

00:13.914 --> 00:16.982
- Oh...
- I'm just joking, I can see they're on.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.984
No, we actually listened
outside to make sure.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.352
JOCELYN: We just brought
some leftovers by.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.454
We had a little thing
at the house last night

00:22.456 --> 00:24.857
and we didn't want all the food
to go to waste, so.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.325
- Yeah, and you know what?

00:26.327 --> 00:27.659
We would have invited
the two of you

00:27.661 --> 00:30.496
but it was kind of a...
political schmoozefest.

00:30.498 --> 00:34.133
A lot of pressing of the flesh,
and greasing palms,

00:34.135 --> 00:35.501
that kind of thing, you know.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.469
- It wasn't as much fun
as it sounds.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.538
- Oh well, who wants an
invitation to big soiree

00:39.540 --> 00:41.974
when you can be met
the very next morning

00:41.976 --> 00:43.609
with some table scraps.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.944
JOCELYN: You know, people were
talking about you too, Moira.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.847
- Oh, they were talking about
the other candidate?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.416
- Yes!

00:50.418 --> 00:53.485
You know, I can't wait for this
whole thing to just be over

00:53.487 --> 00:56.021
so we can all just hang out
again.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.923
- Yeah, yeah...
- Mm-hmm.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.325
- Well, we are off to the bank.

01:00.327 --> 01:03.762
We've got lots of donations
that we need to deposit.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.865
- Well, thank you. Bye! JOCELYN: Bye!
(Door shuts)

01:06.867 --> 01:09.802
- Those two are not as
simple minded as we thought.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.303
- He is.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.508
♪ ♪

01:18.279 --> 01:20.879
- David, Ted said that
I had to wear scrubs,

01:20.881 --> 01:22.281
but what does that mean really?

01:22.283 --> 01:25.217
- Um, I think it means
you have to wear scrubs.

01:25.219 --> 01:28.921
- Ugh. I know but look at me.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.956
- You look... amazing.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.357
- Who designs these things?!

01:32.359 --> 01:34.326
Whatever happened to empowering
women's sexuality?

01:34.328 --> 01:36.628
- I don't think sex appeal

01:36.630 --> 01:39.431
is the guiding principle
behind nursing uniforms.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.067
- Obviously you've never been
out for Halloween, David.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.236
- So are you nervous?

01:44.238 --> 01:46.338
This is like the first job
you've ever had.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.040
- No it isn't.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.109
- Putting your name on a line
of edible nail polish

01:50.111 --> 01:52.044
isn't what I would call
having a job.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.612
- I was very hands on, David.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.248
I came up with all
the flavours by myself.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.484
- Even the one that poisoned
all those people?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.986
- David, the factory in
Guangzhou assured us

02:00.988 --> 02:03.956
that it was lead-free. Ugh!

02:03.958 --> 02:07.025
Anyway, I'm actually really
looking forward to this.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.928
- You look like a stick of gum.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.999
- Like... what? David!

02:14.001 --> 02:15.534
(Sighs heavily)

02:18.372 --> 02:21.340
- Well how much did she take?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.475
- Um, I'm gonna go get a latte.
Do you need anything?

02:23.477 --> 02:25.978
- She's an IT manager, Gerald.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.547
She makes more money
than both of us combined.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.049
I shouldn't be worrying
about these things.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.118
(Phone clatters)

02:33.120 --> 02:36.255
I would love a hot tea.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.724
- Okay. Um...

02:38.726 --> 02:40.792
Is everything okay?

02:40.794 --> 02:43.162
- Yup. Just chatting.

02:43.164 --> 02:47.432
Listen, let me give you
some cash for that.

02:47.434 --> 02:51.537
I don't think that expense card
is long for this world.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.972
- Mm, okay.
It's just I have, um,

02:53.974 --> 02:56.508
four more taxidermy peacocks
coming this afternoon.

02:56.510 --> 03:00.078
- Oh, I can pay cash for those.
That's fine.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.414
(Phone rings)

03:02.416 --> 03:04.016
Don't answer that.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.318
It's either Gerald or the school

03:06.320 --> 03:09.454
and I can't deal with either
right now.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.590
- Okay. Um,
this is really intense,

03:11.592 --> 03:14.026
so I'm gonna go get that tea.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.562
- You're a doll.
You're a doll!

03:16.564 --> 03:18.630
(Phone continues ringing)

03:20.334 --> 03:22.935
- Hey! Sorry I'm a bit late.

03:22.937 --> 03:25.103
Um, I wasn't sure what
the etiquette was

03:25.105 --> 03:26.505
for this kind of thing,

03:26.507 --> 03:27.839
so I walked around the block
a little bit.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.275
- Oh, you can show up early,
or on time.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.777
Early is probably even better.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.111
- Okay, great.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.113
- Alexis, you wanted to be
treated professionally,

03:35.115 --> 03:36.515
so I have to ask,

03:36.517 --> 03:38.417
where are the rest
of your scrubs?

03:38.419 --> 03:41.620
- Oh. I thought this was
kind of an either/or thing.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.556
- No, they come as a set.
That's why I gave you both.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.792
Those bare legs are dangerous.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.160
- (Flirty) Ted!

03:48.162 --> 03:49.561
- No, I'm serious.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.430
The animals carry bugs
or ticks

03:51.432 --> 03:52.864
that can burrow into
your bare skin.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.633
- (Gasps) Ew!

03:54.635 --> 03:57.169
- Don't worry, we'll just have
you focus on filing for today.

03:57.171 --> 03:59.171
- Um, okay. Awesome!

03:59.173 --> 04:01.039
Thank you. So many files!

04:02.610 --> 04:05.344
I'll just dive right into this.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.212
You won't even miss
your last secretary

04:07.214 --> 04:10.048
once I get finished
with these puppies.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.417
TED: Good news!

04:12.419 --> 04:15.354
I found you a loaner pair.
Helen must have left them.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.489
- (Unconvincingly) Phew.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.693
Thank you, Ted.
Those are just perfect.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.097
(Bird chirps,
Door bell jingles)

04:25.099 --> 04:26.565
- Hello!

04:26.567 --> 04:30.335
Ronnie! Hello you!
You're looking well today!

04:30.337 --> 04:32.304
New khakis I see.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.439
Are you enjoying your coffee?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.441
- I was.
- (Laughs)

04:38.746 --> 04:41.713
I'm going to presume you were
at Jocelyn's thing last night.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.181
How was that?

04:43.183 --> 04:46.551
- Good. Lots of dairy.
- Oh, yes.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.221
If anyone knows how to put a
lactose intolerant in the hospital,

04:49.223 --> 04:51.556
it's our Jocelyn.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.192
- Moira, is there something
I can do for you?

04:54.194 --> 04:56.128
- Yes, thank you!

04:57.598 --> 04:59.498
Ronnie, I was wondering
whether or not

04:59.500 --> 05:02.467
You have decided on a candidate
to endorse?

05:02.469 --> 05:05.137
- Not yet.
- Oh! Good.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.538
- Why is that good?

05:06.540 --> 05:09.107
- I'm hoping I might
persuade you

05:09.109 --> 05:11.443
to put your weight behind me.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.080
Political weight.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.684
I now realize 'clout' was
the word I was looking for.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.589
- What makes you think
I'd vote for you?

05:24.591 --> 05:27.492
- You are a sensible woman,
Ronnie,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.494
and you speak your mind.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.197
I-I can feel your frustration
with Roland.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.733
Now imagine his wife
on council,

05:34.735 --> 05:38.503
strengthening his agenda...

05:38.505 --> 05:41.473
- And?
- And, were I on council,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.542
I could support your agenda.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.511
We could support
each other's agendas.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.282
- Well, I don't hate
what you're saying,

05:50.284 --> 05:52.384
so here's what I'm gonna do.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.120
I'm gonna invite some
of my girl friends over

05:55.122 --> 05:58.724
and if you can get on
the good side of these women,

05:58.726 --> 06:04.129
let's just say you'd be locking
down a key demographic.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.530
- It's a date.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.433
- No. No, it's not.
I wouldn't call it that.

06:08.435 --> 06:09.701
-No, I-I didn't--
I didn't mean--

06:09.703 --> 06:11.603
- Uh! Just--
- No, I--

06:11.605 --> 06:13.171
- Thank you.
- Okay.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.539
- Thank you, Ronnie.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.375
(Diner music plays quietly)

06:16.377 --> 06:18.377
- Um, Doris,
that is so exciting!

06:18.379 --> 06:20.045
Love him for you!

06:20.047 --> 06:23.181
- I don't know. I mean,
poor Albert's allergic to cats.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.016
But I can't leave Mittens alone.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.319
So how do I spend time
with Albert?

06:27.321 --> 06:29.287
(Phone rings)

06:30.891 --> 06:32.591
- Veterinary clinic,
how can I help you?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.659
Can I put you on hold?

06:35.929 --> 06:38.397
Okay, so if there's one thing
I learned,

06:38.399 --> 06:39.798
is that when it comes to love

06:39.800 --> 06:42.567
you cannot let little things
get in your way.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.836
Like I once dated
this Sultan's nephew

06:44.838 --> 06:48.673
who was forbidden to talk to me
or even to look at me

06:48.675 --> 06:52.244
and we made it work for like
half a regime change, so...

06:52.246 --> 06:54.646
- You what?
- I know.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.682
- Uh, Alexis,
- Yes.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.151
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

06:59.153 --> 07:00.652
- Yeah.

07:00.654 --> 07:04.322
We're gonna put this on pause.
The doctor needs me.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.992
Yes?
- So how's the filing coming?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.627
- I have been swamped.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.129
Doris's cat is like
totally high maintenance.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.432
- Yeah, well, Doris has been
worried about her cat

07:13.434 --> 07:15.534
for two years.
She comes in every week.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.402
- Okay, well, what am I
supposed to do?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.604
Poor thing is like desperate
for a man.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.741
- And, uh, why are there
three calls on hold?

07:22.743 --> 07:25.544
- Um... I don't know,
someone hung up?

07:25.546 --> 07:28.447
- Okay, Alexis,
there is more to the job

07:28.449 --> 07:30.449
than just keeping
the customers happy, all right?

07:30.451 --> 07:33.084
This is a place of business
and right now,

07:33.086 --> 07:36.388
there are clients waiting
to talk to me.

07:36.390 --> 07:39.458
Are you sure that
you're cut out for this?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.293
- (Unsure scoff) Mm.
- Okay.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.261
- 'Kay.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.031
- Well, look, I-I can't talk
about this now,

07:46.033 --> 07:47.766
I have to go.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.434
- I just wanted to let you know

07:49.436 --> 07:51.870
that we just sold one
of the leather ponchos.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.372
- Oh, we're selling
leather ponchos now?

07:54.374 --> 07:56.341
Well, that doesn't sound cheap.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.276
- No, it's not,
which is why it's so exciting

07:58.278 --> 07:59.811
that we just sold one.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.647
- That's fabulous, David.
- It is.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.483
Um, so I was gonna go,

08:04.485 --> 08:06.585
unless needed me
for something else.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.119
- That was Gerald and...

08:08.121 --> 08:10.288
now I have a meeting
at the school tomorrow

08:10.290 --> 08:13.925
and I've got no one to take
care of my stepdaughter.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.761
His ex-wife certainly
won't do it.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.664
- Wow... Well, if there's
anything I can do, just--

08:19.666 --> 08:23.902
- I need someone to take care
of my stepdaughter.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.872
- Okay. Well, if there's
anything I can do, just--

08:26.874 --> 08:30.709
- I need you to take care
of my stepdaughter.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.812
- 'Kay, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.681
- I'm gonna drop her off
at four.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.651
- I'm looking forward to it.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.420
- You're a doll.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.528
(Birds chirp)

08:49.530 --> 08:50.962
(Pamphlets thunk)

08:52.399 --> 08:55.767
- I brought you some trail mix,
but I spilled it in my purse.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.803
- So sweet of you, Doris.
Thank you.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.741
(Knocks on filing cabinet)

09:02.743 --> 09:05.677
Hey, I was thinking about
what you said yesterday

09:05.679 --> 09:09.514
and, um, I think--
- Now is not a good time.

09:09.516 --> 09:13.018
- Okay. Um... how are things
with Mittens?

09:13.020 --> 09:14.953
Uh... he-he's dead.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.757
- Ew!

09:18.759 --> 09:21.026
- I'm just trying to figure out
what happened, all right?

09:21.028 --> 09:23.595
- Okay. Um, well, what am I
supposed to tell Doris?

09:23.597 --> 09:25.063
- Don't say anything to her.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.332
Just keep her company
while I figure this out, okay?

09:27.334 --> 09:29.367
- Okay, so I'm just supposed to
act like nothing happened?

09:29.369 --> 09:31.469
- Yeah, for now.
- Okay.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.405
Um, how am I supposed
to do that?

09:33.407 --> 09:35.674
- Alexis.
- Okay.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.310
Yeah. 'Kay.

09:38.312 --> 09:39.611
(Sighs heavily)

09:39.613 --> 09:41.079
(Birds chirp)

09:43.717 --> 09:45.650
(Door squeals open)

09:45.652 --> 09:47.519
- Hi!
(Door thunks shut)

09:47.521 --> 09:51.856
Um... do you have any like DVDs

09:51.858 --> 09:54.960
or like a dusty old board game
I could borrow?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.429
- Oh, usually we reserve those
for our Platinum members.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.863
- Mhmm.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.799
- Oh, but I do have
a Rummoli box

10:00.801 --> 10:03.435
filled with puzzle pieces
on the shelf there.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.670
- Sounds like something you'd
find at a serial killer's house.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.606
- Hmm. Big night planned?

10:07.608 --> 10:11.376
- Um, I am babysitting tonight,
so...

10:13.647 --> 10:15.513
- You're joking.

10:15.515 --> 10:16.881
- Mm-mm. I wish I was joking.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.750
- But you hate kids.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.719
- Mm-hmm. That's correct.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.088
- Oh my God. Can I watch?
- No.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.623
- Or video tape?
- No, you-- no.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.124
- Can I bring friends?
- No.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.460
My boss's life is a bit
of a mess right now,

10:28.462 --> 10:32.931
so I said I'd help out by
babysitting her stepdaughter.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.568
- And you're sure you can
do this on your own?

10:36.570 --> 10:38.036
- Mm-hmm.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.338
Um, 'cause I'm a fully capable
human being.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.009
Um, if you happen to find
any Xanax...

10:44.011 --> 10:46.077
lying around anywhere,

10:46.079 --> 10:49.014
can you just...
let me know about that?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.991
- (Sighs)

11:01.695 --> 11:06.731
- I-I think I might just pick
up these treats while I wait.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.201
- Oh... um, yeah, no, um...

11:10.203 --> 11:13.605
but these treats are actually
gonna go on sale next week,

11:13.607 --> 11:15.640
so maybe you just wanna
hold off until then?

11:15.642 --> 11:18.176
- Well, I think he'd really
like them.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.944
- Yeah...

11:19.946 --> 11:22.914
I'm sure he would really
like them...

11:22.916 --> 11:25.050
if he wasn't... dead.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.922
- What?
- Yeah, he's dead.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.159
But! But the good news is,
you're not.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.629
- Mittens is dead?

11:37.631 --> 11:39.564
- Yeah. But um...

11:42.102 --> 11:46.037
But you're free, Doris,
and, in a way, so is Mittens.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.808
- Oh. What happened?
- We're not sure yet,

11:49.810 --> 11:51.810
but I think that
the important thing

11:51.812 --> 11:54.012
is that Mittens is
no longer suffering.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.214
- (Crying) Oh, what do I
do now?

11:56.216 --> 12:00.652
Do I put him in a box?
bury him? (Crying)

12:00.654 --> 12:03.855
- Ew! No, we don't have to talk
about that right now, okay?

12:03.857 --> 12:05.690
I know this is hard.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.526
But, um, the upside, um...

12:08.528 --> 12:12.163
The upside - Oh! - is that
Albert from the down the hall

12:12.165 --> 12:13.631
can now come over for dinner

12:13.633 --> 12:17.202
without worrying about his
allergies threatening his life.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.504
Hey. I think it's time
that we find you

12:19.506 --> 12:21.740
a new love of your life.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.576
- (Crying)
- It's okay.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.979
♪ ♪

12:30.484 --> 12:33.451
- John, wait.
I didn't tell you earlier

12:33.453 --> 12:36.187
because I didn't want you
to back out on me,

12:36.189 --> 12:39.924
but you're going to be
the only man here this evening.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.926
- Well, I think
I can handle that.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.195
- Mm-hmm? Ronnie told me
that her friends

12:44.197 --> 12:46.531
represent a key demographic

12:46.533 --> 12:50.001
and I don't believe
it's women with husbands.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.303
- Oh...
- Mm-hmm.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.705
(Knocking)

12:53.707 --> 12:55.073
- I feel really good
about this,

12:55.075 --> 12:56.374
and I think you just approach
these women

12:56.376 --> 12:57.842
like you did Paula,
our landscaper.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.178
Very strong, very forceful.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.949
- Oh!
- Hello, Ronnie.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.918
- Hi.
- Hello.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.020
- Come in... both of you.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.295
(Door creaks shut)

13:17.297 --> 13:21.800
TV Program: We're counting down the
top 100 hottest stars in Hollywood.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.868
From this Canadian--

13:23.870 --> 13:25.937
- Has that actress
had work done too?

13:25.939 --> 13:27.272
- Um, yeah, you can always tell

13:27.274 --> 13:29.040
because their upper lip
sort of...

13:29.042 --> 13:30.909
I mean, like, puffs a bit.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.277
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.279
Do you want more coffee?
- Yes, please.

13:34.281 --> 13:38.016
(TV program plays
in the background)

13:38.018 --> 13:40.952
- Okay, so we've run out
of sugar.

13:40.954 --> 13:44.055
Um, do you want it still
because I don't really.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.724
(Door thunks shut)

13:46.726 --> 13:49.060
TV PROGRAM: This star has
everyone wondering...

13:49.062 --> 13:51.529
How will that face turn out?

13:51.531 --> 13:53.898
Well, folks, ktake a look at
her now!

13:53.900 --> 13:56.234
- You okay?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.002
- (Nervously) I'm fine...

13:58.004 --> 14:01.840
- Are you sure?
- Something happened.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.509
- What?!

14:04.511 --> 14:08.213
- Nothing. Just d-don't look
on the bed.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.383
TV PROGRAM: The self-described
tom-boy...

14:12.385 --> 14:14.118
- (Dramatic gasp)

14:14.120 --> 14:16.054
TV PROGRAM: ...has become a
serious star on the rise,

14:16.056 --> 14:18.256
which is why we've named her
number--

14:18.258 --> 14:21.226
- It's okay!
TV PROGRAM:...on our hot list!

14:21.228 --> 14:23.261
- Needless to say,
that was the last time

14:23.263 --> 14:24.929
I played charades
with Fran Leibovitz.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.198
ALL: (Laughing)

14:27.200 --> 14:30.735
- Oh, this is wonderful.
Wonderful!

14:30.737 --> 14:32.270
And I would love
to regale you all night

14:32.272 --> 14:35.607
with entertaining anecdotes,
but I would be remiss

14:35.609 --> 14:38.076
if I didn't outline
some of my policies

14:38.078 --> 14:40.912
for this community
of remarkable women.

14:40.914 --> 14:44.315
JOHNNY: Moira, could I have
a word?

14:44.317 --> 14:47.285
Excuse us, ladies.
Family matter.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.120
- I knew I should've left him
home with the sitter.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.788
WOMEN: (Laughing)

14:53.360 --> 14:56.394
- Moira, I have a feeling not
every woman here is a lesbian.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.030
- Oh, John, you love to think
women are flirting with you.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.833
- No, I was just talking
someone over there

15:01.835 --> 15:04.569
who has a husband.
A male husband.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.472
- Everything all right?

15:07.474 --> 15:08.973
- Yes. Ronnie,

15:08.975 --> 15:11.276
when mentioned earlier
that I might lock down

15:11.278 --> 15:14.379
a key demographic this evening,
you meant what?

15:14.381 --> 15:15.880
- Entrepreneurs.

15:15.882 --> 15:19.183
Everyone here is a member of the
Women's Business Association.

15:19.185 --> 15:22.086
- Oh. Business Association.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.255
- Yes, that's what I--

15:24.257 --> 15:27.258
- I think we're all ready
when you are.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.460
- All I'm missing
is my teleprompter!

15:29.462 --> 15:31.162
(Chuckles awkwardly)

15:32.432 --> 15:35.900
- Business Association.
- Yes, I heard her.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.336
Oh God. (Drinking)

15:38.338 --> 15:41.739
(Spray spritzes,
bottle clunks on table)

15:43.710 --> 15:47.712
- You know, I have to say
that I'm impressed.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.814
It's not everyone
who can tell an old woman

15:49.816 --> 15:52.250
that her cat is dead,
and set up a love connection,

15:52.252 --> 15:54.786
and sell our most expensive
marble urn

15:54.788 --> 15:56.487
in the same three-minute
conversation.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.656
- Well, I'm not totally sure
about the love connection.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.992
I'm still waiting for Doris
to text me back.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.428
- Right.
- So.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.862
- Uh, was there something
that you wanted to say to me?

16:04.864 --> 16:06.264
- What?
- Uh, just earlier,

16:06.266 --> 16:08.599
it seemed like you were trying
to tell me something.

16:08.601 --> 16:12.270
- Oh! No, I think it was about,
um, vacation days.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.806
- Ah.
- Yeah, you had mentioned two weeks.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.708
So I guess I was
just wondering,

16:16.710 --> 16:21.379
Um, how many two-week vacations
are available per year?

16:21.381 --> 16:24.148
- Well, tell you what,
why don't we start with one

16:24.150 --> 16:26.317
and then we'll just go
from there.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.120
- Okay. Yeah. That could work.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.089
- Great.
- Great.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.962
DAVID: Honestly?
Nothing is more natural...

16:37.964 --> 16:41.699
um, aside from maybe the...
thread count in these sheets,

16:41.701 --> 16:45.203
but that's okay!
'Cause you're a woman now!

16:45.205 --> 16:48.773
Um, and nothing about that
is embarrassing.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.276
- I'm not embarrassed,
I'm scared!

16:52.278 --> 16:54.212
I mean, you were talking
so much

16:54.214 --> 16:56.080
about your high thread count
linens...

16:56.082 --> 16:58.249
- Yeah. Well, I think it's
gonna come out.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.752
- And how they were made
by Egyptians or something?

17:00.754 --> 17:03.721
- No, I'm well aware of that.
Um, so...

17:03.723 --> 17:08.226
So, uh, I think my sister has
some wonderful products

17:08.228 --> 17:10.762
in there for you.

17:10.764 --> 17:13.097
Uh, health accessories,

17:13.099 --> 17:16.267
so feel free to help yourself
to those.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.270
Um... okay.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.843
Uh... (knocking)

17:27.347 --> 17:29.414
So you can just tie that
around your waist, okay?

17:29.416 --> 17:32.784
- Yeah, thank you.
(Door thunks shut)

17:32.786 --> 17:35.887
Mmm... okay.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.289
(Paper rustles)

17:42.295 --> 17:46.330
- (Clears throat)
Equality. Freedom. Marriage.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.302
These are the rights
of every community,

17:51.304 --> 17:55.473
and even more specifically...
the business community.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.445
No faction of society deserves
to be discriminated against,

18:00.447 --> 18:05.450
Especially women who...
are in business faction.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.890
One of my top priorities
will be to...

18:12.892 --> 18:15.526
to change people's misguided

18:15.528 --> 18:19.330
and ignorant perceptions
of women like you.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.999
You did not choose this life!

18:22.001 --> 18:26.370
No, each one of you was born
to be an entrepreneur.

18:29.843 --> 18:34.479
Why don't I open up the floor
to some of your concerns?

18:34.481 --> 18:37.148
- I want to elect someone
who understands the pressures

18:37.150 --> 18:39.517
of working and raising a family.

18:39.519 --> 18:43.254
- Very nice, yes. I love that.
(Applause)

18:43.256 --> 18:45.623
- Working and...?
- Raising a family.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.391
- And raising a family.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.094
Well, John, my husband will
back me up on this,

18:50.096 --> 18:51.963
I had a six-and-a-half
season career

18:51.965 --> 18:56.000
as an actress in television,
which I put on hold

18:56.002 --> 18:59.470
to devote all my time
and energy

18:59.472 --> 19:03.674
to raise two million dollars
for charity.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.110
- And two children.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.312
- Oh, yes, and two children.

19:08.314 --> 19:12.250
Hmm? And on top of that,
I managed a staff of twelve.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.218
- You ran your own business?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.454
- Household staff, yes.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.323
- Ronnie says you've only
lived here a year?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.092
- That's true, Ronnie,
thank you,

19:21.094 --> 19:22.994
but I am a quick study.

19:22.996 --> 19:27.064
Karen, I learned tonight that
you run a gravel business, yes,

19:27.066 --> 19:30.001
and you, Audrey, you manage
a team of accountants,

19:30.003 --> 19:31.469
and you, Tara,

19:31.471 --> 19:33.304
you're very concerned
about your inverted nipples.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.040
(Crickets chirp outside)

19:36.042 --> 19:37.542
Which I assumed was public
domain;

19:37.544 --> 19:39.610
there were a lot of you around
when she told.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.449
Well, ladies, I'm-I'm not that
different from any of you.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.186
I had my first job
at the age of ten,

19:48.188 --> 19:50.354
sweeping up hair
in a beauty salon.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.524
I will never forget the value
of a hard day's work.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.127
Believe me when I tell you,
if elected,

19:56.129 --> 19:59.430
I will put just as much work
into my time on council

19:59.432 --> 20:04.368
as you women put into
your businesses every day.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.440
ALL: (Applauding)

20:16.282 --> 20:17.949
- Oh, being in business myself,

20:17.951 --> 20:20.151
I've attended quite a few
of these functions,

20:20.153 --> 20:22.320
and this one was quite
the success.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.422
- Yeah, I think your wife's
gonna do okay.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.023
- Well, she pulled it off,
didn't she?

20:26.025 --> 20:28.259
Considering she came in -
well, we both did -

20:28.261 --> 20:32.496
thinking everyone was...
- Black?

20:32.498 --> 20:36.300
- No. I mean that everyone
was leaning...

20:36.302 --> 20:38.135
- Younger?
- John, we should go.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.737
- No, what I mean is that, uh,

20:39.739 --> 20:44.108
that I am very comfortable
seeing women with other women.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.711
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, that didn't come out right. I...

20:46.713 --> 20:49.180
M-Moira and I have been
very, very supportive

20:49.182 --> 20:52.183
