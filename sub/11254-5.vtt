00:03.795 --> 00:05.088
{\an3}My name is
Boyce Ballentine.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.132
{\an3}I'm running for mayor
of St. Louis,

00:07.215 --> 00:09.092
and I could really
use your support.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.302
A donation of any sort--hello?

00:12.721 --> 00:15.807
{\an1}- Hello, Ms. Maynard.
My name is Lolli Ballentine,

00:15.890 --> 00:20.520
{\an1}and my husband Boyce Ballentine
is running for mayor, and--

00:20.603 --> 00:22.230
Hello?

00:22.313 --> 00:23.440
{\an1}Come on!

00:23.523 --> 00:24.774
- Keep it going.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.235
The key to fundraising
is persistence.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.529
{\an1}- I've gotten like three
hang-ups in a row.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.489
One guy did keep me
on the phone for a while

00:31.573 --> 00:34.784
but I had the feeling
he was touching himself.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.370
- Did he ask you
what you have on?

00:37.454 --> 00:39.205
{\an3}I got the same dude.
All right.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.668

those calls, Kelvin,

00:43.752 --> 00:46.129

a smile in your voice.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.297

00:47.380 --> 00:50.300

00:50.383 --> 00:54.763
Mr. Bendix,
my name is Lolli Ballentine...

00:54.846 --> 00:58.767

Keep 'em going, Kelvin.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.775

01:06.858 --> 01:08.026
- Dad, I can't right now.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.445
{\an1}I got 1,000 more
fundraising calls to make.

01:10.528 --> 01:11.696

01:11.780 --> 01:13.198
This is not about
running for mayor.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.741

you already have

01:20.121 --> 01:23.374

01:24.417 --> 01:25.794

that in the car.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.087
- No kidding.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.215
{\an3}Son, you're stretching
yourself too thin.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.384
{\an3}You can't run a campaign and
a church at the same time.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.511
- I know, Dad.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.762
{\an1}I got to find a preacher
to sub for me.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.056

can help me out?

01:38.139 --> 01:39.849

I'm retired.

looking at you.

{\an1}I'm saying can you
help me find somebody?

01:44.103 --> 01:46.356
- I'll start
making some calls.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.192
Before you start writing your
sermons on the commode.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.529
- You will?

01:52.612 --> 01:54.030
Thank you, Mr. Heflin.

01:54.113 --> 01:57.742
{\an1}How much can I
put you down for?

01:57.826 --> 01:59.536
Three doll--$3?

01:59.619 --> 02:00.954
Come on, man!

02:01.037 --> 02:02.038
You can't be that cheap!

- Damn you, Saxby.
I will take you down.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.030
- You know, I've been working
on some ideas for Boyce's ad

08:51.113 --> 08:52.323
and I was thinking that--

08:52.406 --> 08:53.991
- Stamps, I have
professionals working on it.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.911
Isn't there a gym
open somewhere?

08:56.994 --> 08:59.038
{\an3}- Ah.
Oh yeah, I get it.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.583
{\an1}You think that I'm just
biceps and abs.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.877
{\an1}But I'm a person
with a lot of layers.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.422
{\an1}Sure, the top layer
is 2% body fat,

09:08.506 --> 09:10.466
{\an1}but I could be very
useful to this campaign.

09:10.549 --> 09:11.634
- All right,
let's review.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.135
{\an3}I put you on
voter registration;

09:13.219 --> 09:14.303
you hit on women.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.597
{\an3}I had you put up lawn signs;
you hit on women.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.767
I sent you to do community
outreach at the Elks Lodge,

09:19.850 --> 09:22.436
{\an3}and somehow you still
hit on women.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.980
{\an3}- Wait.
Come on.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.148
{\an3}Just give me a chance
to pitch myself.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.192
- Go ahead.
- All right--No, no, no, no.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.152
No phubbing.
- What, now?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.821
- I explained it
to you yesterday.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.155
- I don't remember.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.949
{\an3}- Because you were
looking at your phone.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.284
Yeah, you're addicted!

09:36.367 --> 09:38.160
You're like a baby
with its blankie.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.870
{\an1}- I am not!
I'm just busy.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.998
{\an3}- Okay, I bet you can't put
your phone down for 30 minutes.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.333
{\an1}- No, I can't.
I'm running a campaign.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.003
{\an3}- 15 then, okay?
It's 7:45 now.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.297
Give me till 8:00.
- [groans]

09:49.380 --> 09:51.757
- Oh.
Baby need her blankie?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.260
{\an1}- Fine, but you
call me "baby" again,

09:54.343 --> 09:57.013
and I will end you.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.515
- This is gonna be fun!

09:59.598 --> 10:00.599
{\an1}- Ugh.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.643
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:04.353
{\an1}- So if you want to be
our new pastor,

10:04.437 --> 10:06.689
we need to know
that you share

10:06.772 --> 10:09.191
{\an1}the same values
as our community.

10:09.275 --> 10:13.279
{\an1}Tell me, what is the most
important thing to you?

10:13.362 --> 10:14.488
- Family.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.199
- Wrong. It's God.
Next.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.243
{\an1}The story of the poor
widow's offering

10:19.327 --> 10:22.038
is told in two of the gospels.
Which--

10:22.121 --> 10:28.002
- Mark 12:41-44
and Luke 21:1-4.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.213
- Oh.
Someone knows his stuff!

10:31.297 --> 10:33.716
- What coins did--
- Two mites.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.718
- How many mites in a quadrans?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.220
- There are two mites
in a Roman quadrans.

10:38.304 --> 10:42.350
- How many leptons in a mite?
- Three. No, four.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.728
- A lepton <i> is</i> a mite!
Next!

10:45.811 --> 10:47.063
{\an3}- Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay, brother.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.231
{\an3}Let it out.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.275
{\an1}It's not you.
It's him.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.069
{\an1}You are a mean,
terrible, old man!

10:53.152 --> 10:56.197
- I said "next."

10:58.032 --> 10:58.949
- I can't stay
in this man's house

10:59.033 --> 11:01.952
with that thing
hanging on the wall.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.329
{\an3}Come on,
let's get out of here.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.289
{\an1}- Boyce, we will be fine
without his money.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.624
{\an3}- Yeah.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.626
{\an3}We'll just have to
make some more phone calls.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.795
- Phone calls?
- Let's go.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.131
- Before we go,
let's consider

11:14.215 --> 11:18.886
{\an1}that <i> we</i> might be the ones
who are prejudiced.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.680
- How so?

11:21.764 --> 11:25.226
{\an1}- Maybe he's just a fan
of "The Dukes of Hazzard."

11:25.309 --> 11:27.645
{\an3}- You know what, I did
like "The Dukes of Hazzard."

11:27.728 --> 11:30.606
And I never thought
of them as racist.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.817
- Me neither!
I always wore

11:32.900 --> 11:34.610
{\an1}my little cut-off
Daisy Dukes.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.570
{\an3}- And that doesn't
make you a bad person.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.989
{\an3}Hell, that's half
the reason I married you.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.159
{\an3}There he is.
Hey.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.162
{\an1}- Look at that wave.
He seems so nice.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.873
{\an3}- I know, and he's
gonna write me a big check,

11:47.957 --> 11:49.375
which is also nice.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.460
[both sigh]

11:51.544 --> 11:52.586
- And he's got
a black friend.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.047
- He probably got
a lot of black--

11:55.131 --> 11:57.007
- Oh, damn.
- Oh Lord, that's the caterer.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.346
- Boyce, I hate to say it,

12:02.430 --> 12:05.182
{\an1}but we should probably
call Alicia.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.475
{\an3}- You know,
good thinking.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.060
{\an3}She'll know
what to do here.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.895
{\an3}Plus she's always
on call.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.482
- So really, if I hadn't gotten
my driver's license taken away,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.151
{\an1}Boyce would've never started
the fight with City Hall,

12:15.234 --> 12:17.069
and he wouldn't be
running for mayor.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.488
{\an3}- So you're a bad driver,
a screw-up,

12:19.572 --> 12:21.532
{\an3}and a burden on
your brother.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.201
{\an1}- I prefer the term
"catalyst for change."

12:24.743 --> 12:28.205
[phone buzzing]

12:28.289 --> 12:30.458
{\an1}- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
No blankie.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.917
{\an3}- Just let me see
who it is.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.628
{\an1}- Sure.
In nine minutes.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.215
[phone buzzing]

12:40.593 --> 12:41.844
- [sighs] Damn it.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.471
I keep trying to text
Alicia and every time

12:43.554 --> 12:48.601
I put in the word "debacle,"
it autocorrects to "DeBarge."

12:48.684 --> 12:51.187
{\an3}- Boyce, he's coming this way.
What do we say?

12:51.270 --> 12:53.230
What do we say?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.065
both: Hey.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.610
- Boyce, Lolli,
why are your glasses empty?

12:57.693 --> 13:01.655
{\an3}- We are drinking
a lot faster than normal.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.575
{\an1}- Before I forget,
I got you a little something.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.993
- Oh, whoa.
- Whoa!

13:06.076 --> 13:08.245
{\an3}That's one more zero
than I expected.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.040
{\an1}- Well, you two are more
delightful than I expected.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.208
- [laughing]
- Thank you, Denny.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.460
We appreciate it.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.961
You know, we couldn't
help but notice

13:16.045 --> 13:19.006
that you have a big
collection of, um...

13:19.089 --> 13:20.508
{\an1}things.

13:21.717 --> 13:22.801
- Flags and such.
- Oh.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.846
{\an1}- Now, that's a real piece
of Missouri history.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.225
It's an original.
150 years old.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.645
{\an1}- Amazing in all that time
it wasn't destroyed.

13:32.728 --> 13:36.148
- I know.
Especially these days.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.483
Luckily I got it before people

13:37.566 --> 13:39.443
started making such
a big hullabaloo.

13:39.527 --> 13:43.072
- [mutters unintelligibly]

13:43.155 --> 13:44.406
- Oh, excuse me.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.619
- Boyce, I guarantee you
that somewhere in this house,

13:48.702 --> 13:52.706
{\an1}that man has Django,
chained.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.876
{\an3}- So everyone
was telling me,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.545
{\an3}"What kind of road manager
are you,

13:57.628 --> 13:59.630
{\an3}booking Boyce 'the Voic''
at the Grand Ole Opry?"

13:59.713 --> 14:01.298
{\an3}Well, I'll tell you
what kind:

14:01.382 --> 14:02.758
a smart one.

14:02.841 --> 14:03.300
- Wow, they liked him?

14:03.384 --> 14:06.220
- Oh, God no.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.013
They booed him
off the stage.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.975
The smart part was,
I got him paid up front.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.685
{\an3}Now, in terms
of dollars per minute.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.771
{\an3}Boyce is the highest paid
performer in showbiz history.

14:15.854 --> 14:16.647
{\an1}- All right,
I admit you tell

14:16.730 --> 14:19.358
{\an1}some pretty good stories,
Stamps.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.317
But I'm not sure
how that proves

14:20.401 --> 14:21.777
you'd be an asset
to the campaign.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.196
- I'll tell you
what it proves.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.073
{\an3}You said you'd give me
till 8:00?

14:26.156 --> 14:27.950
Well, it's almost 9:00.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.368
{\an1}- Oh, my God,
is it?

14:29.451 --> 14:31.787
{\an3}- Heh, I just Grand Ole Opry'd
your ass.

14:31.870 --> 14:32.871
- [scoffs]

14:32.955 --> 14:33.872
- See, Alicia,

14:33.956 --> 14:34.665
this is my skill, okay?

14:34.748 --> 14:36.292
I can sell people anything.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.419
Now, come on.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.753
Boyce has done
so much for me.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.130
{\an3}I want to do something
for my brother.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.674
- All right.
- Thank you.

14:43.757 --> 14:44.967
Here's your phone.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.929
{\an1}- Oh, my God!
Ten messages from Boyce?

14:49.013 --> 14:51.932
Boyce, what's wrong?
Did you get the check?

14:52.016 --> 14:54.226
{\an3}- I got the check,
but I don't think I can keep it.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.479
{\an3}The man has a Confederate flag
hanging on his wall.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.188
- Huh.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.149
- Yeah.

15:00.232 --> 15:04.028
- Let's handle this
in a sane, thoughtful manner.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.779
Why don't you take the check,

15:05.863 --> 15:08.365
<i>we'll spend it on ads,</i>
<i>and then when you're mayor</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:10.492
we'll discuss whether
it was the right thing to do.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.787
- No. He and I are going
to discuss this now.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.748
- [exasperated sigh]

15:15.831 --> 15:17.666
Great.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.669
{\an1}- Boyce, Lolli,
chocolate-covered strawberry?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.504
- Wow!

15:22.588 --> 15:24.465
- Not now, Denny.
- Oh, don't worry.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.633
They're not from my store.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.676
They're fresh.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.471
{\an1}- Look, we appreciate that,
but I gotta tell you.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.848
{\an1}You know all those people
that made a hullabaloo

15:32.931 --> 15:34.683
about the Confederate flag?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.268
Well, I'm one of
those people.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.353
- Oh, come on, Boyce.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.980
It's just
a historical artifact.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.774
{\an1}- Yeah,
an artifact of slavery.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.859
- It's my heritage.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.028
- A heritage of slavery.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.782
{\an1}- Okay, slow down there,
Boyce.

15:49.865 --> 15:53.619
- You see, my ancestors
were just proud people

15:53.702 --> 15:55.871
fighting
for their independence.

15:55.954 --> 15:56.955
- Well, so were mine.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.166
{\an1}Independence
from your people.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.169
- Boyce, I just want to talk
about the future of the city.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.712
Why are we arguing
about something

16:03.796 --> 16:05.589
that happened 150 years ago?

16:05.673 --> 16:08.050
{\an1}- Because you have the flag
hanging in there now.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.011
- Yeah, making it seem like
those were the good ol' days.

16:11.095 --> 16:15.182
- Now wait
just a cotton-pickin' minute.

16:15.265 --> 16:19.061
- Why does our minute
gotta have cotton in it, Denny?

16:19.144 --> 16:21.480
- I don't understand why
y'all are making such a big deal

16:21.563 --> 16:23.399
about all this.
- See? That's just it.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.025
You don't get it, do you?

16:25.109 --> 16:27.611
If you understood what that flag
means to millions of people,

16:27.695 --> 16:29.613
you wouldn't keep
decorating with it.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.242
- Ah!
- Yeah.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.577
- I still don't get it.
- Okay.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.162
You know what?
We're done here.

16:37.246 --> 16:37.996
You can keep your check.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.207
{\an3}- I'm surprised,
Boyce.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.000
I thought you were
one of the good ones.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.837
- Oh, I know you didn't
go all the way <i> there</i> with it.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.463
- I meant one
of the good politicians.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.090
- Don't catch a case.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.551
{\an3}- I know he ain't gonna
roll up on my like that, baby.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.845
I'll take your little 59 Cent
and make change.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.680
[platter clatters]

16:56.390 --> 16:59.601
- I was gonna eat
one of those.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.941
{\an3}- So I can put you down
for $75?

17:06.023 --> 17:07.776
Thank you for your support.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.613
Hey.
- $3?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.451
Thank you for your support.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.871
- Well, I did my best, son,

17:18.954 --> 17:21.457
but I couldn't find you
a substitute pastor.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.540
- You gotta be kidding me.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.959
- None of 'em measured up.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.627
{\an3}- Oh. Oh, yeah,
they were terrible, Pastor.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.630
One guy had a bad haircut.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.592
{\an3}One guy had his watch
on the wrong wrist.

17:31.675 --> 17:34.094
Then there was the guy
who blinked too much.

17:34.178 --> 17:38.515
{\an3}Then there was the guy
who didn't blink enough.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.976
- It was like watching
a robot preach.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.270
{\an1}- Well, guess we're stuck
without a preacher,

17:43.353 --> 17:45.898
{\an1}since clearly nobody,
nobody at all,

17:45.981 --> 17:48.067
is qualified to do the job.

17:48.150 --> 17:52.321
- Okay, you twisted my arm.
I'll do it.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.490
- Of course you will.
Come on, admit it, Daddy.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.241
This is what you wanted
the whole time.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.494
{\an3}- Wow!

17:58.577 --> 17:59.912
- Don't "wow."

17:59.995 --> 18:02.080
I don't know
what y'all talking about.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.332
- Really, Daddy?

18:03.415 --> 18:05.334
You get to preach
and complain about it.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.794
That's like heaven on Earth
for you.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.796
- Well, fine,
I won't do it then.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.173
- I'll do it!
- [sighs]

18:11.256 --> 18:13.509
- So look, on Sunday
when you first get up there,

18:13.592 --> 18:15.803
you just want to...
- You know what?

18:15.886 --> 18:18.138
You Ballentines are mean.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.140
{\an1}- Lester, you know I'm kidding.
Lester, come on now.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.391
You made him mad, Daddy.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.976
Lester, I ain't
gonna call you again.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.855
both: Lester! Lester!

18:26.939 --> 18:28.190
- My throat is sore.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.983
{\an3}Can I be finished
on the phones?

18:30.067 --> 18:31.860
{\an1}- Nope.
Set her up, Kelvin.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.278
- It's pointless.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.030
{\an3}I've been on the phone
two hours.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.616
{\an3}You know I could have made
more money drumming on a bucket

18:37.699 --> 18:40.035
in front of the grocery store?

18:40.118 --> 18:42.204
- Oh, come on, Mr. Bradley.
I thought we were tight.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.622
Dig a little deeper, dog.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.707
Ah!
That's what I'm talking about.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.376
Oh, yeah.
You and I are going to do shots

18:47.459 --> 18:49.545
at Boyce's victory party,
let me tell you.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.880
[chuckles]
All righty, all righty.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.216
Buh-bye.
That's already $250.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.218
Hey, Kelvin, hit me again.
Time is money.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.386
What's up, Loll?
Hey, Ms. Keller?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.888
Let me ask you,
how do you feel about freedom?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.975
[chuckles]
Me too. Me too.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.561
{\an1}- Do you want me
to ask Stamps

19:05.644 --> 19:07.813
{\an1}to help you
with your phone technique?

19:07.896 --> 19:10.232
{\an3}- Hell no.
I'll show you technique.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.610
Hit me, Kelvin.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.028
- Hello, Mr. Kinnard,
this is Lolli,

19:15.112 --> 19:18.574
and I have something
very important

19:18.657 --> 19:20.576
to talk you you about.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.995
Oh, I'm sorry, punkin,
is your daddy home?

19:23.078 --> 19:25.372
Put him on the phone.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.164
Put him on the phone!
