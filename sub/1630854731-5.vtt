WEBVTT

00:02.088 --> 00:05.222
Ugh, this line
is taking so long.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.745
People should know what
they want before they order.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.007
Next.

00:08.007 --> 00:12.403
Oh... what do I want?
What do I want?

00:12.403 --> 00:15.580
Ugh.
What is "co-ffee"?

00:15.580 --> 00:17.277
Ugh, this place
is so bougie.

00:17.277 --> 00:20.933
Lavender-infused maggots?
Like, really?

00:21.542 --> 00:24.067
Damn.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.546
Okay, that's really good.

00:28.593 --> 00:33.380
Fellow Boomtownians, not only
am I a successful businessman,

00:33.380 --> 00:35.643
I am also a patron
of the arts.

00:35.643 --> 00:38.342
Which is why every summer
I direct a production

00:38.342 --> 00:40.735
from the Great Bard himself.

00:40.735 --> 00:44.217
I speak of none other
than Jim Carrey.

00:44.217 --> 00:45.218
Jim!

00:45.218 --> 00:48.917
Mm, wow. Interesting.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.659
As you all know, last year
we had a runaway success

00:51.659 --> 00:53.922
with our production
of "The Green One."

00:53.922 --> 00:56.577
"How the Grinch
Stole Christmas?"

00:56.577 --> 00:58.057
- No.
- Was it "Batman Forever,"

00:58.057 --> 00:59.537
the one where he played
the Riddler?

00:59.537 --> 01:01.626
No.
"The Mask."

01:01.626 --> 01:05.238
Huh, guess I didn't realize
how many movies he was green in.

01:05.238 --> 01:07.240
It's kind of crazy
when you think about it.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.851
Anyway, this year,
I have selected

01:09.851 --> 01:12.071
Mr. Carrey's magnum opus--

01:12.071 --> 01:16.728
"Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective: Part Un."

01:16.728 --> 01:18.947
Auditions will start tomorrow,

01:18.947 --> 01:22.647
and yes, there will be
full-frontal nudity.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.866
Mom, did you hear that?
What?

01:24.866 --> 01:27.173
Oh, my God, someone ate
all of the samples.

01:27.173 --> 01:29.480
Who did that?
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.872
Whoever did that is rude.

01:30.872 --> 01:32.439
We should go.
Go, go, go.

01:42.797 --> 01:44.669
So excited
for friends weekend.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.150
We haven't had quality
hang time in forever.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.631
I know. I found
the cutest fallout shelter.

01:50.631 --> 01:52.546
They still have
the original scratch marks

01:52.546 --> 01:54.026
from when the inhabitants

01:54.026 --> 01:55.897
were escaping
a radiation leak.

01:55.897 --> 01:57.290
Oh, my God, cu-u-u-u-te.

01:57.290 --> 01:59.162
Okay, ready.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.468
I didn't know what to pack, so I
just brought everything I own.

02:01.468 --> 02:03.514
Oh, I didn't realize
Sid was coming.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.298
If this is supposed to be
just a friends thing,

02:05.298 --> 02:07.082
I'm totally happy to sit out.

02:07.082 --> 02:09.215
I mean, if that's
what <i>you</i> want,

02:09.215 --> 02:11.652
then I am totally fine
with that.

02:11.652 --> 02:13.132
You guys are ridiculous!

02:13.132 --> 02:15.134
You're my two favorite people
in the world.

02:15.134 --> 02:17.310
We're gonna have
a blast together!

02:17.310 --> 02:18.790
Ugh, great. Great.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.835
- Let's go.
Mommy,
you can't leave!

02:20.835 --> 02:22.794
Remember, you told me
you'd take me to the audition.

02:22.794 --> 02:26.841
I'll be going out
for the role of Ace.

02:26.841 --> 02:28.974
Oh, shoot,
I forgot about that.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.149
Sorry, but we're leaving
right now.

02:30.149 --> 02:31.585
No, no, no, no, no.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.978
No, no, no.

02:34.675 --> 02:37.156
Ple-e-e-e-e-ase!

02:37.156 --> 02:38.810
I promise I'll never ask you

02:38.810 --> 02:41.029
for anything ever again
in my entire life. Please.

02:41.029 --> 02:43.162
Fine.

02:44.990 --> 02:48.254
So what, I'm just
driving alone with Sid?

02:48.254 --> 02:50.996
Awesome start
to friends weekend.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.737
Hmm?

02:52.737 --> 02:54.782
Are you sure
that I should go?

02:54.782 --> 02:58.046
I really get the impression
Tai does not like me.

02:58.046 --> 02:59.483
Are you kidding?
Tai loves you!

02:59.483 --> 03:02.747
He just has a super sarcastic
sense of humor,

03:02.747 --> 03:03.878
but you'll get
used to it.

03:03.878 --> 03:05.358
Come on,
you fugly-ass bitch.

03:05.358 --> 03:07.055
You are too much.

03:07.055 --> 03:08.796
Ah, you got me.

03:08.796 --> 03:11.799
Fugly as charged.

03:11.799 --> 03:14.454
Alrighty then.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.894
That was great.
We'll let you know.

03:19.894 --> 03:21.156
Hard pass.

03:21.156 --> 03:23.811
Hello. Hey, there.
How you doing?

03:23.811 --> 03:26.553
You doing good?
I am doing great.

03:26.553 --> 03:28.468
Um, I won't be needing this.

03:28.468 --> 03:31.036
You ready to make some magic?

03:31.036 --> 03:32.472
Whenever you're ready.

03:32.472 --> 03:34.300
Bla-bla-bla. Okay.

03:42.003 --> 03:43.918
- What are you doing?
- Oh, uh, sorry.

03:43.918 --> 03:46.921
I'm auditioning
for the pet detective.

03:46.921 --> 03:49.489
This is a show about a-a dog
who-- who solves crimes, right?

03:49.489 --> 03:53.276
No, it's about a human
who finds missing pets.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.452
No.
Uh, okay.

03:55.452 --> 03:58.063
Not what I rehearsed, but--

03:58.063 --> 04:01.414
Hey, I can be a human man.

04:05.766 --> 04:07.333
Woof! No.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.553
Uh, human man, human man,
human man, human man.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.384
Sorry, one second.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.386
One second, one second,
one second.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.476
Hey! What the hell
are you doing on my car?!

04:19.476 --> 04:21.869
Sorry, there wasn't
anywhere else to sit.

04:21.869 --> 04:22.914
I'll just be a minute.

04:22.914 --> 04:25.395
Move it, lady!
Now!

04:27.266 --> 04:31.270
I said...
"I'll just be a minute."

04:31.270 --> 04:33.490
Now, are you gonna
be nice?

04:33.490 --> 04:35.100
Or are you gonna make me
smack around

04:35.100 --> 04:36.406
those big old titties

04:36.406 --> 04:38.103
and call you
my sweet Georgia peach?

04:38.103 --> 04:40.323
What the hell...

04:40.323 --> 04:43.064
I'm a man.
I'm a man.

04:43.064 --> 04:44.588
This is a disaster.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.547
No one we've seen has what
it takes to play Ace.

04:47.547 --> 04:49.462
We need someone with
that raw passion, you know,

04:49.462 --> 04:51.029
and the fire
inside of them.

04:51.029 --> 04:54.511
I will dropkick your soul
straight to Hell!

04:54.511 --> 04:57.992
Fee-fi-fo-fum!

04:57.992 --> 05:00.995
You're crazy, lady!

05:00.995 --> 05:02.954
Good luck cleaning my barf
off your windshield

05:02.954 --> 05:05.260
without wipers, asshole!

05:06.479 --> 05:08.002
What is wrong
with you?!

05:10.135 --> 05:12.180
It's coming up!

05:12.180 --> 05:14.792
Who is she?
She's demented,

05:14.792 --> 05:16.750
she's absolutely
out of control, she's--

05:16.750 --> 05:18.361
Perfect.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.579
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

05:19.579 --> 05:22.626
I think
we've found our Ace.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.584
Plan "B," berry boy.

05:24.584 --> 05:27.457
You're gonna
wish I puked!

05:27.457 --> 05:29.197
- Don't you do it!
- Whoo!

05:29.197 --> 05:30.851
Well, here it is.

05:30.851 --> 05:32.200
Isn't it adorable?

05:32.200 --> 05:33.288
I'm gonna go say hi
to everyone.

05:33.288 --> 05:34.855
- You'll get the bags?
- I mean, I--

05:34.855 --> 05:38.729
I can, but don't you have,
like, super-human...

05:38.729 --> 05:41.906
strength?

05:44.387 --> 05:46.563
Okay, Sid.
You can do this.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.392
Just do your best
until Freya gets here.

05:49.392 --> 05:52.656
Maybe Tai's friends
will be nice.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.789
Hey, everyone. I'm Sid.
Nice to meet you...

05:55.789 --> 05:57.704
all.

05:57.704 --> 06:00.141
Oh, hey.

06:00.141 --> 06:04.537
Ah, it's five identical Tais.

06:04.537 --> 06:06.409
Perfect.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.020
Okay, people, settle down!

06:09.020 --> 06:10.804
This is "Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.938
Show some respect
for the old masters.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.722
Alright, let's take it
from Ace's entrance.

06:15.722 --> 06:17.420
And action.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.117
Oh, Tom?

06:19.117 --> 06:21.075
I'm sure he's fine.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.647
Do not go in there.

06:27.647 --> 06:29.736
Whoo.

06:29.736 --> 06:33.261
Eh... that's a good start.

06:33.261 --> 06:35.394
Maybe a smidge stiff.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.961
This play doesn't even
make any sense.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.092
If he's supposed to be undercover,

06:38.092 --> 06:39.703
then why is he busting in,

06:39.703 --> 06:42.053
telling everyone
about his big poop?

06:42.053 --> 06:43.271
You're looking at it all wrong.

06:43.271 --> 06:45.317
Ace Ventura is a dark tragedy

06:45.317 --> 06:47.972
about a deeply
disturbed individual.

06:47.972 --> 06:51.236
It's a meditation
on man's animalistic nature,

06:51.236 --> 06:54.326
the Jungian concept
of shadow self,

06:54.326 --> 06:57.111
not to mention a scathing
indictment of brain injuries

06:57.111 --> 06:59.723
in professional football.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.682
Huh, that's actually
kind of deep.

07:02.682 --> 07:04.118
Just give it
one more try.

07:04.118 --> 07:05.293
Shall we?

07:05.293 --> 07:06.947
Whenever you're ready.

07:10.124 --> 07:11.169
Oh, Tom?

07:11.169 --> 07:14.738
I'm sure he's fine.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.914
Do not go in there!

07:16.914 --> 07:18.655
Whooo!

07:21.048 --> 07:23.616
That's my Ace.

07:30.231 --> 07:33.583
Ooh, getting a nice head high
from this one.

07:35.062 --> 07:37.064
I heard TI-120

07:37.064 --> 07:40.677
slid into TI-2000's DMs
during CyberFest.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.549
Wait, I thought TI-120
was with TI-167.

07:43.549 --> 07:45.420
Oh, he is.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.641
- Oooooh!
- What a ho!

07:48.641 --> 07:50.338
Morning, gents!
Um, so, I've been doing

07:50.338 --> 07:52.471
some research on activities
in the area and turns out

07:52.471 --> 07:54.125
there is an old,
unexploded atom bomb

07:54.125 --> 07:56.214
not far from here
called "The Dud."

07:56.214 --> 07:59.522
Uh, does anyone feel up for a
sort of medium-difficulty hike?

08:03.874 --> 08:06.877
Is that a fanny pack?

08:06.877 --> 08:08.835
What a dipshit.

08:08.835 --> 08:11.882
Stop!
This is fun.

08:11.882 --> 08:15.538
Getting hard-core roasted
by five identical Tais.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.977
Sorry, guys, uh,
Freya made me bring him.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.370
Speaking of which,
she should be here by now.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.897
<i>Hey!</i> Hey, bitch!

08:26.897 --> 08:28.942
You close? <i>Oh, my God, Tai.</i>

08:28.942 --> 08:31.075
So I took Scraps to that
audition, and guess what?

08:31.075 --> 08:33.338
I got the lead!

08:33.338 --> 08:34.644
That is great.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.776
We'll celebrate
when you get here.

08:36.776 --> 08:38.778
Yeah, about that.

08:38.778 --> 08:41.607
We open tonight, and I still
have to practice my big

08:41.607 --> 08:44.001
Act Three talking-out-of-my-butt
soliloquy.

08:44.001 --> 08:47.570
So is it cool if I maybe
skip friends weekend?

08:47.570 --> 08:51.878
Oh, so, um,
you're not coming at all?

08:53.184 --> 08:56.143
Yeah, no, that's cool. <i>Really?</i>

08:56.143 --> 08:57.101
You promise
you're not mad at me?

08:57.101 --> 08:58.929
No, no.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.366
You do you, girl.
I'm good.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.281
Oh, thanks, Tai.
You're the best.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.978
<i>I hope you guys
are having a blast.</i>

09:04.978 --> 09:08.068
<i>Bye-e-e-e-e.</i> Bye-e-e-e.

09:08.068 --> 09:09.374
Hey, man, are you okay?

09:09.374 --> 09:10.593
Do you wanna--
Do you wanna talk?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.333
What's there
to talk about?

09:12.333 --> 09:13.770
I don't care if Freya
comes or not.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.250
I came here to party.
Pass me the magnet.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.994
Oh, take it easy.

09:28.219 --> 09:31.178
I'm pinwheeling, baby!

09:31.178 --> 09:33.093
Whoo!
Yeah, America!

09:36.009 --> 09:37.881
Maybe I'll give you a call
sometime, lieutenant.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.622
Your number still 911?

09:39.622 --> 09:42.102
Alrighty then.

09:42.102 --> 09:44.844
- How was that?
- Yeah, it was good.

09:44.844 --> 09:47.107
Just like
the last 25 times.

09:47.107 --> 09:49.936
Good's not enough,
it needs to be perfect.

09:49.936 --> 09:52.547
Alrighty then.
Alrighty <i>then.</i>

09:52.547 --> 09:53.810
Alrighty then!

09:53.810 --> 09:55.986
Gah!
Why can't I get this?!

09:55.986 --> 09:57.640
Oh, hey, look, maybe we should
just take a break, alright?

09:57.640 --> 09:59.163
You've been going non-stop.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.468
I mean, you haven't eaten,
you haven't slept.

10:00.468 --> 10:02.340
I'm really starting to worry
about you.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.735
I see what you're doing.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.215
You're trying
- to sabotage me.
- What?

10:08.215 --> 10:11.131
You're jealous that I got
the role and you didn't.

10:11.131 --> 10:14.657
I'm the big star,
and it's killing you inside.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.049
Whoa, okay, look, maybe I was
a little bummed at first,

10:16.049 --> 10:18.312
but I'm genuinely
trying to help you.

10:18.312 --> 10:19.662
Well, don't!
You don't understand us!

10:19.662 --> 10:23.143
Nobody understands us!
Ugh!

10:25.406 --> 10:27.060
Us?

10:30.498 --> 10:32.457
Hey, guys.
Have you seen Tai?

10:33.719 --> 10:35.460
I mean TI-90?

10:37.244 --> 10:39.203
Never mind,
I'll find him myself.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.597
Tai? Tai?

10:42.597 --> 10:44.121
Wha--
What are you doing?

10:44.121 --> 10:45.905
I'm landlining.

10:45.905 --> 10:47.515
I'm about to put a billion gigs
straight to my dome.

10:49.735 --> 10:52.129
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.870
Oh, shit.

10:56.829 --> 10:58.875
Oh, no, no, no.
I do not like those noises.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.572
Okay, I think
you've had enough.

11:00.572 --> 11:01.965
Back off!

11:05.272 --> 11:06.883
What is your problem?

11:06.883 --> 11:09.233
Why are you always
such a dick to me?

11:09.233 --> 11:10.625
I'll tell you why.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.584
Because you sabotaged
my friendship with Freya

11:12.584 --> 11:15.195
and stole her for yourself!

11:15.195 --> 11:17.894
Everything was better
before you came along.

11:17.894 --> 11:21.375
I should have done this
a long time ago.

11:24.509 --> 11:28.600
Whoa! Whoa!
Aah! Aah!

11:29.949 --> 11:32.604
Tai!

11:36.521 --> 11:39.524
<i>Goodbye.</i>

11:39.524 --> 11:41.918
TI-95: Oh, God.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.223
He's dead.

11:43.223 --> 11:45.835
He's [bleep] dead!

11:45.835 --> 11:49.752
Aaah!

11:52.972 --> 11:54.887
That's not how Dan Marino
holds a football!

11:54.887 --> 11:56.236
He holds it like this!

11:56.236 --> 11:58.761
Laces up!

11:58.761 --> 12:00.632
Bill, have you gained weight?

12:00.632 --> 12:01.894
You're supposed to be
the Miami Dolphin,

12:01.894 --> 12:04.767
not the Miami Beluga Whale.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.769
And has anybody seen my Ace?!

12:06.769 --> 12:09.510
Mr. Rubinstein!

12:09.510 --> 12:11.121
What is it, boy?

12:11.121 --> 12:12.818
It's Freya.
She's not acting like herself.

12:12.818 --> 12:14.298
She's speaking
in weird voices

12:14.298 --> 12:16.256
and just acting like
a crazy person.

12:16.256 --> 12:18.781
Oh, no.
It's happening.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.305
What's happening?

12:21.305 --> 12:22.785
It's been said that
the character of Ace Ventura

12:22.785 --> 12:25.613
is so dark,
so deeply twisted,

12:25.613 --> 12:29.226
that it has the potential
to infect the mind of anyone

12:29.226 --> 12:33.099
who inhabits his deranged
world view for too long.

12:33.099 --> 12:34.492
It happened
to my first Ace,

12:34.492 --> 12:36.842
and it made her
mentally insane forever.

12:36.842 --> 12:39.279
It also happened
to my second Ace.

12:39.279 --> 12:41.151
Actually, it's happened
to all of my Aces,

12:41.151 --> 12:42.674
now that
I think about it.

12:42.674 --> 12:43.893
I just feel like
that's information

12:43.893 --> 12:45.677
you should have
told us earlier.

12:45.677 --> 12:48.027
There's not much time!
Take me to her!
I'm sorry.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.858
Hello?

12:56.035 --> 12:57.689
Freya?

12:59.299 --> 13:01.998
Freya's not here anymore.

13:01.998 --> 13:05.740
There is only... Ace!

13:05.740 --> 13:08.308
Mommy, no!

13:08.308 --> 13:10.920
Um, hey, Ace.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.835
You think we could, uh,

13:12.835 --> 13:16.142
maybe talk with Freya
for a second?

13:16.142 --> 13:19.145
Freya's never coming back.

13:19.145 --> 13:24.020
She was a la-hoo-sa-her.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.325
She's too far gone.

13:25.325 --> 13:28.198
We're gonna have to
take her down.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.199
Go!
- Yah!

13:29.199 --> 13:30.635
Aah!

13:30.635 --> 13:32.724
No!
You're la-hoo-sa-hers!

13:32.724 --> 13:35.988
You're all la-hoo-sa-hers!

13:43.561 --> 13:45.650
What's going on?

13:45.650 --> 13:46.956
Mr. Rubinstein says
that I need

13:46.956 --> 13:49.306
to keep you tied up
to protect you.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.524
- But the play is starting!
- I know.

13:50.524 --> 13:52.048
Don't worry,
they have an understudy.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.701
What? Who?

13:53.701 --> 13:55.573
Snowflake is missing!

13:55.573 --> 13:57.227
Who can find him?

14:04.799 --> 14:06.018
Um...

14:09.065 --> 14:12.416
Help.
I forgot all my lines.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.070
All of them?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.723
Yes!

14:18.335 --> 14:19.640
Scraps, you have
to let me go, please.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.773
This play means
everything to me!

14:21.773 --> 14:23.644
I'm sorry, Mommy,
but Mr. Rubinstein

14:23.644 --> 14:25.342
says if I let you
anywhere near that stage,

14:25.342 --> 14:27.257
you risk turning into
Ace Ventura forever.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.085
Would you let me go
for a snausage?

14:29.085 --> 14:31.565
Oh, my God,

14:31.565 --> 14:34.264
snausages are so
mouth-wateringly delicious.

14:35.830 --> 14:38.137
But no. I made a promise
to protect you,

14:38.137 --> 14:39.747
and there's nothing
you can say

14:39.747 --> 14:40.879
that can make me
break my word.

14:40.879 --> 14:43.708
Two snausages?
Instant yes.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.057
Come on, Tai!

14:45.057 --> 14:46.189
How are we doing
with tech support?!

14:46.189 --> 14:47.668
I'm still on hold!

14:47.668 --> 14:49.105
No, I would not like to speak
to an operator.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.324
Get me a robot!
A robot!

14:51.324 --> 14:52.717
Did you try blowing
into his butt?

14:52.717 --> 14:56.025
What?
Like this.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.984
No, no. I'm sorry. I'm just--
I'm not gonna do that.

14:58.984 --> 15:01.291
Hang on, this is
a fallout shelter.

15:01.291 --> 15:05.121
Which means they might have--
Hang on.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.644
Where are you going?

15:06.644 --> 15:07.862
It's an ancient human trick
for bringing electronics

15:07.862 --> 15:08.994
back from the dead.

15:08.994 --> 15:11.518
What is that?

15:11.518 --> 15:13.129
It's rice.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.833
What do we do now?

15:21.833 --> 15:24.879
We wait.

15:24.879 --> 15:28.231
I'm having a full-blown
panic attack

15:28.231 --> 15:30.842
and you're all just staring
at me.

15:30.842 --> 15:34.672
You're allowing
an innocent man to die!

15:34.672 --> 15:39.503
Of course, that might
not do any good.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.462
You see, nobody's missing
a porpoise.

15:42.462 --> 15:44.682
It's a dolphin
that's been taken.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.118
You don't have to do this.

15:46.118 --> 15:48.120
The common harbor porpoise
has an abrupt snout,

15:48.120 --> 15:50.601
cone-shaped teeth... It's not worth
risking your life!

15:50.601 --> 15:53.299
... and a serrated
dorsal appendage.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.392
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.916
Hey, maybe I'll give you
a call sometime.

16:01.916 --> 16:03.962
Your number still 911?

16:03.962 --> 16:05.572
Alrighty then!

16:20.631 --> 16:22.285
Now let's see that
in rewind.

16:27.942 --> 16:30.684
♪ O sole mia ♪

16:33.122 --> 16:36.299
♪ O sole mio ♪This is art.

16:40.477 --> 16:46.439
Ree-hee-hee-hee-heeally?

16:51.662 --> 16:52.924
Yes!

17:06.242 --> 17:07.330
Where'd she go?

17:08.548 --> 17:13.205
Dear God,
or whatever AI overlord

17:13.205 --> 17:15.338
might be applicable here,

17:15.338 --> 17:19.559
don't take Tai
into your big cloud in the sky.

17:19.559 --> 17:24.477
Bring him home to his
charging station of origin.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.739
Amen.

17:25.739 --> 17:27.001
A-robot.

17:30.744 --> 17:32.833
Easy, there.
You're still booting up.

17:32.833 --> 17:35.009
Did I-- Did I lose my--

17:35.009 --> 17:37.838
No, don't worry.
All your tabs are still open.

17:37.838 --> 17:39.710
Oh, okay.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.712
I-I'm gonna read those someday.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.583
I really am.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.716
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank Sid.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.892
He's the one who saved you.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.459
You did?

17:49.459 --> 17:51.765
I--
I thought you hated me.

17:51.765 --> 17:53.593
I don't know why
you thought that.

17:53.593 --> 17:56.422
I've been trying really hard
to be your friend.

17:56.422 --> 17:58.381
Y-- You're important
to Freya, Tai,

17:58.381 --> 18:01.514
which means
you're important to me.

18:01.514 --> 18:06.476
Ah, jeez. I'm sorry.
I've been such a jerk to you.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.912
I've been blaming you
for the fact

18:07.912 --> 18:09.348
that my friendship
with Freya

18:09.348 --> 18:13.222
isn't what it used to be,
but it's not your fault.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.224
And I hate to admit it,

18:15.224 --> 18:19.880
but you're actually
a pretty great guy.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.145
Thank you.
That means a lot.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.103
Well, I still think
you're a dipshit.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.758
Oh, yeah.
Dorky loser dipshit.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.238
Yeah.
Thanks, guys.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.895
Mommy!
Are you out there?

18:34.895 --> 18:37.507
Mommy!

18:37.507 --> 18:41.424
Over there!
On the cliff!

18:41.424 --> 18:45.384
Freya, you don't have
to listen to Ace!

18:45.384 --> 18:46.603
You can fight it!

18:46.603 --> 18:48.387
It's okay.

18:48.387 --> 18:49.954
I'm just saying goodbye.

18:55.916 --> 19:02.053
Ace, you came to me when
my life felt small and boring,

19:02.053 --> 19:07.406
and you reminded me that
there's still magic out there.

19:07.406 --> 19:10.322
But I don't need you anymore.

19:10.322 --> 19:12.368
I'll be...

19:12.368 --> 19:13.934
alrighty then.

19:16.328 --> 19:17.938
Alrighty then.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.599
We can go home now.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.167
Ahh, I knew you'd be okay.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.300
I wasn't worried about you
for a second.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.605
Let's go.
Come on.

19:50.232 --> 19:53.322
Guys, isn't it crazy
that this nail is metal,

19:53.322 --> 19:54.932
and we're metal?

19:54.932 --> 19:57.369
We could've been this nail.

19:57.369 --> 20:00.111
I would've made
such a good nail.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.461
You know what's
a weird word?

20:02.461 --> 20:06.204
Robot.
Robot.

20:06.204 --> 20:08.685
Whoa, that is weird.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.295
Hey, guys?

20:10.295 --> 20:13.080
You know how the only numbers
are one and zero?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.386
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

20:14.386 --> 20:16.649
Well, what if there were
other numbers?

20:16.649 --> 20:21.567
I mean, there are
other numbers.

20:21.567 --> 20:24.091
Two, for example.

20:24.091 --> 20:25.919
Whoa.
Whoa.

20:25.919 --> 20:28.182
Sid, you're, like,
a genius.

20:28.182 --> 20:31.360
Thanks, man.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.274
I'm so [bleep] up.
