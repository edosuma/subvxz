02:40.118 --> 02:42.906
- Green light.
- Let's go.

02:47.992 --> 02:52.200
How many times was John Wayne nominated
for an Academy Award?

02:52.284 --> 02:54.285
Probably not enough.

02:57.743 --> 02:59.869
Marcellino's still asleep.

03:03.870 --> 03:07.411
- I'm gonna go relieve Ed.
- How the hell can one son of a bitch sleep so much?

03:07.536 --> 03:09.996
- Fear.
- As long as he wakes up to testify.

03:47.708 --> 03:51.250
Oh, no.

04:00.461 --> 04:02.585
We've been looking for you.

04:04.586 --> 04:07.420
So you want to be a witness?

04:07.503 --> 04:09.712
Witness this.

04:18.046 --> 04:20.297
His birthday
was in two weeks.

04:20.464 --> 04:23.798
Harry, they wanna
take him out.

04:23.882 --> 04:25.840
Harry?

04:31.216 --> 04:37.051
Twenty-seven years of this shit,
and I never got a scratch. Jesus Christ.

04:40.134 --> 04:42.052
I want a list of everybody
in Witness Protection...

04:42.135 --> 04:44.090
who knew we
were holding Marcellino...

04:44.132 --> 04:46.340
and anybody else
who could've known...

04:46.466 --> 04:48.758
from the district attorney
to the commissioner.

04:50.091 --> 04:52.008
They're dead, Mike.

04:52.133 --> 04:54.092
Whoever set this up...

04:55.134 --> 04:57.092
whatever it takes...

04:58.301 --> 05:00.801
they're dead.

05:00.885 --> 05:03.302
Okay, Cullen. You're outta here.

05:25.598 --> 05:29.223
<i>Now you're off and runnin’
Runnin’ like you're scared</i>

05:29.307 --> 05:33.141
<i>Runnin’ under radar
Runnin’ like a deer</i>

05:33.266 --> 05:36.975
<i>Somethin’ in the bushes
Starin’ out at you</i>

05:37.059 --> 05:40.017
<i>Starin’ at your feelings
Feelin’ like you do</i>

05:40.142 --> 05:44.682
<i>One-way rider
Wanderin’ down the road</i>

05:46.474 --> 05:51.892
<i>Baby, I'm right beside you
everywhere you go</i>

05:53.767 --> 05:58.392
<i>Once upon a daydream
Circumstances do</i>

05:58.476 --> 06:01.560
<i>Everything to hold on
Everything for you</i>

06:01.644 --> 06:05.310
<i>First we found a loser
Next we found a fool</i>

06:05.393 --> 06:09.062
<i>Now we follow footsteps
taken up on you</i>

06:09.145 --> 06:13.395
<i>One-way driver
One way down the road</i>

06:15.647 --> 06:18.647
<i>- Baby, I'm right beside you
- Hey, you goddamn son of a...</i>

06:18.772 --> 06:20.730
<i>Everywhere you go</i>

06:43.439 --> 06:46.232
- Whoa!
- Damn!

08:10.370 --> 08:14.203
<i>Yes, sir. Well, a number
of the residents have complained...</i>

08:14.328 --> 08:18.746
<i>though, about the trash around the Dumpster,
so I think you should do something about it.</i>

08:18.871 --> 08:23.330
Yes, sir. Heh! All right.
Have a good day then.

08:30.249 --> 08:32.748
- You caught the bastard.
- In the act.

08:32.831 --> 08:35.457
Bullshit. I was on my way
to a costume party.

08:35.582 --> 08:39.582
He stopped somebody over at Route 74
for driving too fast.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.414
- He was going to let them off for 50 bucks.
- They stopped me for directions.

08:42.498 --> 08:44.497
Book him.

08:45.832 --> 08:48.916
Impersonating an officer,
resisting arrest...

08:49.040 --> 08:53.458
fraud, reckless driving
and lying to the sheriff.

08:53.582 --> 08:56.291
- I'll be at home if you need me.
- Okay, Sheriff.

09:00.793 --> 09:04.334
Come on, Deputy Dawg.

09:25.005 --> 09:28.464
<i>Amy! Amy!</i>

09:35.048 --> 09:37.216
Amy?

09:37.341 --> 09:39.299
Amy?

09:43.631 --> 09:45.880
- Are we having a party?
- Of course...

09:46.005 --> 09:50.133
and I'm glad you're home early
to join in the celebration.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.091
Is it just gonna be us,
or are we gonna have company?

09:53.174 --> 09:56.633
Be serious. Of course it's just us.

09:56.758 --> 09:59.300
So, what are we celebrating?

10:00.509 --> 10:03.176
Commemorating...

10:03.300 --> 10:06.760
our fifth year.

10:06.844 --> 10:11.302
Five years in exile.
Five years in a town without...

10:11.469 --> 10:14.720
having found anybody who could talk
about anything except...

10:14.845 --> 10:17.095
crops and the weather.

10:17.178 --> 10:20.012
- It's not gonna be forever.
- The hell it's not.

10:22.138 --> 10:24.888
Christ, Amy, this is old news.
Let it go.

10:25.013 --> 10:28.180
- I did the best I could.
- The hell you did.

10:28.264 --> 10:30.848
You could still be with the bureau.
You could've fought it.

10:30.973 --> 10:34.390
We could still be living in New York.
You did not have to quit!

10:34.515 --> 10:37.141
They gave me a chance to resign.
If it would've gone to trial...

10:37.224 --> 10:39.850
I would've lost
and they would've kicked me out.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.305
I wouldn't have even had
the chance to get this job!

10:54.516 --> 10:57.308
What are we having
for dinner?

10:57.392 --> 10:59.391
Just this.

11:03.851 --> 11:06.017
This is gonna make us fat.

11:06.143 --> 11:09.227
You think because we're in shape
we're not already fat?

11:09.310 --> 11:12.310
<i>We're like all the cows
they raise around here.</i>

11:12.477 --> 11:16.353
Stuck.
Victims of circumstance.

11:16.520 --> 11:21.354
And you know what a cow's
biggest contribution to this world is?

11:33.023 --> 11:36.106
You should not drink
and bake.

12:32.114 --> 12:34.032
Hello, Mark.

12:34.115 --> 12:37.614
- Yeah?
- It's Shannon, Mark. Harry Shannon.

12:37.740 --> 12:42.779
It's been a long time, Harry.
What's going on?

12:42.821 --> 12:46.239
I want to talk to you, Mark.
I got trouble.

12:46.364 --> 12:49.947
- Talk.
- No. Not on the telephone.

12:50.031 --> 12:52.823
It's all I've got time for.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.740
Things aren't so good,
huh, kid?

12:55.865 --> 12:58.033
Seen better days.

12:58.158 --> 13:01.824
If you wanna see 'em again,
meet me.

13:36.290 --> 13:40.165
The bureau always arranges
such intriguing meeting places.

13:41.540 --> 13:44.413
This has nothing to do with the bureau.

13:44.538 --> 13:49.205
Mr. Patrovita,
you deny any sources of illicit income...

13:49.331 --> 13:51.623
any connection at all
with organized crime...

13:51.706 --> 13:56.998
yet your reported income
for this past year was $73,000...

13:57.081 --> 14:01.000
<i>with which you somehow
managed to maintain...</i>

14:01.125 --> 14:04.125
a seven-bedroom mansion
here in Chicago...

14:04.167 --> 14:06.542
<i>a hunting lodge in Wisconsin...</i>

14:06.667 --> 14:08.834
<i>a winter resort in California...</i>

14:08.959 --> 14:11.877
four Cadillacs that we know of...

14:12.002 --> 14:15.085
and a lifestyle that makes
Ted Turner look like a derelict.

14:15.210 --> 14:18.836
Now, can you explain
how you manage this?

14:18.920 --> 14:20.920
I think it'd be of particular interest
to those of us...

14:21.045 --> 14:23.378
<i>- on fixed incomes.
- Hold it. That's Baxter.</i>

14:23.503 --> 14:26.087
- I know, I know.
- What the hell has he got to do with it?

14:26.213 --> 14:29.880
- He's special federal prosecutor.
- That son of a bitch cost me a career.

14:30.005 --> 14:33.255
You brought in a suspect with
half the bones in his body broken.

14:33.339 --> 14:36.381
- Any prosecutor would've gone after you.
- Oh, you remember the case.

14:36.465 --> 14:39.089
The guy kidnapped
an 11-year-old girl.

14:39.215 --> 14:41.712
He molested, murdered
and mutilated her.

14:41.837 --> 14:46.755
Well, the public wasn’t too keen
on heavy-handed cops at that time.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.756
Baxter was out
to nail me to the wall.

14:49.881 --> 14:52.797
- I went to see him, tried to tell him what happened...
- What did he say?

14:52.881 --> 14:56.924
Resign or be prosecuted.
Any way you want it.

14:57.049 --> 14:59.341
Yeah, well,
the good news is that...

14:59.424 --> 15:03.466
he's giving Patrovita a lot more shit
than he ever gave you.

15:03.591 --> 15:06.091
<i>I got a lotta debts.</i>

15:06.217 --> 15:10.342
Uh-huh. To whom?

15:10.467 --> 15:14.761
- Friends.
- Like Paulo Rocca and Bill Rusman?

15:19.636 --> 15:22.261
I plead the Fifth Amendment.

15:22.345 --> 15:24.470
<i>That's Lu Patrovita.</i>

15:24.553 --> 15:28.137
He runs the strongest
of the Chicago families.

15:33.722 --> 15:37.389
<i>- Mr. Rocca,
your stated source of income...</i>

15:37.515 --> 15:41.097
is a travel agency, yet you,
like Mr. Patrovita...

15:41.181 --> 15:45.596
seem to, uh, have a lifestyle
that far exceeds your income.

15:45.721 --> 15:48.430
Would you mind shedding some light
for us on what seems to be...

15:48.555 --> 15:50.931
some extraordinary
money management here?

15:51.056 --> 15:54.806
I'll take the Fifth on this,
on whatever you're gonna ask me next...

15:54.889 --> 15:56.932
<i>and everything after that.</i>

15:57.057 --> 16:01.098
Honest men don't have to tolerate
this kind of harassment in this country.

16:01.182 --> 16:05.183
Thank you, Mr. Rocca,
for reminding us of our inalienable rights.

16:05.308 --> 16:07.183
<i>Rocca is the undertaker.</i>

16:07.308 --> 16:11.309
<i>Anybody bothers Patrovita,
this one buries 'em in the gravel pit.</i>

16:11.351 --> 16:16.976
<i>So we did Who's Who In Chicago. You're the one
in the bureau. What do you want from me?</i>

16:21.603 --> 16:24.728
Do, uh...
Do you remember my son?

16:24.895 --> 16:30.229
Blair. Yeah. We went to
some ball games with him.

16:30.312 --> 16:33.647
- Yeah, that's right.
- He joined the bureau, didn't he?

16:35.772 --> 16:38.064
Yep.

16:38.147 --> 16:40.065
<i>How is he?</i>

16:44.729 --> 16:46.730
Dead.

16:52.898 --> 16:55.147
I want Patrovita.

16:56.564 --> 17:00.524
- He killed Blair?
- Blair was covering a government aide...

17:00.607 --> 17:03.690
a witness who could've
put the bastard away forever.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.733
No.

17:06.857 --> 17:08.983
No, he had
somebody do it.

17:10.608 --> 17:14.818
There's nothing that a small-town sheriff
can do that you can't.

17:14.943 --> 17:18.568
Oh, no, no. The bureau
has nothing to do with this.

17:18.734 --> 17:21.486
No, I'm financing
this myself.

17:21.569 --> 17:25.194
I have $45,000
in savings.

17:27.529 --> 17:32.530
I want you to get inside the Patrovita
organization and tear it up.

17:32.655 --> 17:36.322
Who do you think I look like?
Dirty Harry?

17:36.406 --> 17:40.489
- I think you look like an unhappy man.
- You have a cure?

17:40.572 --> 17:42.737
Possible reinstatement.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.987
Get back into the bureau.

17:45.070 --> 17:47.446
<i>- Hmm?
- How?</i>

17:47.571 --> 17:51.863
The bureau's been trying to get somebody
inside of Patrovita's family for over a year...

17:51.947 --> 17:55.155
but there's
a big leak somewhere.

17:55.239 --> 17:57.406
All our guys
keep getting nailed.

17:57.531 --> 18:03.282
That's why no one but me
will know about you. Nobody.

18:03.366 --> 18:09.200
Now, you do a good job, you pull this off,
and you've got a great shot.

18:09.283 --> 18:11.742
<i>Now, what do you say?</i>

18:12.867 --> 18:15.326
Do you think I'd
still pass the physical?

19:00.581 --> 19:06.083
This is Kaminski, investigating a break-in
at the Petrolcam storage yard.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.624
Roger, Sheriff. We copy.

20:28.095 --> 20:30.678
I'm sorry you had to kill yourself off, kid...

20:30.761 --> 20:33.637
but it's safer
for everybody that way.

20:33.762 --> 20:37.263
<i>The top slot
is Luigi Patrovita.</i>

20:37.346 --> 20:40.889
<i>He's been up there for over 20 years.
He's smart.</i>

20:40.972 --> 20:44.344
<i>Buried a marching band
getting where he is.</i>

20:45.637 --> 20:48.053
<i>His right arm is
a guy named Rocca.</i>

20:48.137 --> 20:51.430
<i>He'd kill for table scraps.</i>

20:51.513 --> 20:53.596
<i>Him you watch close.</i>

20:54.763 --> 20:57.890
The false I.D. Corresponds
to a guy...

20:57.973 --> 21:01.139
in the N.C.I. Computer
with a bad rap sheet.

21:01.264 --> 21:03.807
The phone number
is a safe house...

21:03.932 --> 21:07.183
where an answering machine
is set up to catch your bulletins.

21:07.265 --> 21:11.849
There's $25,000 for initial expenses;
more if you need it.

21:11.932 --> 21:16.018
The squat-face guy is a new kid on the block.
His name is "Hammer" Lamanski.

21:16.101 --> 21:20.560
He's been biting off
little pieces of Patrovita's pie.

21:20.685 --> 21:23.977
<i>Doing damage to him
is probably your quickest way...</i>

21:24.101 --> 21:26.728
<i>to catch the big mars eye.</i>

21:26.811 --> 21:30.103
<i>Remember, there's a leak.</i>

21:30.187 --> 21:33.645
<i>He's the one
who got Blair killed.</i>

21:33.729 --> 21:35.729
<i>He's the one I want.</i>

21:35.854 --> 21:38.396
<i>Well, see ya in Chicago.</i>

21:42.560 --> 21:45.353
Big player, number eight!

21:45.437 --> 21:47.978
<i>Place your bets. Place your bets.
Place your bets.</i>

21:49.896 --> 21:52.605
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.273
All bets down.
All bets down.

22:01.272 --> 22:03.857
Throw the dice!

22:05.607 --> 22:10.107
Seven! You lose.
Come and get another number.

22:10.191 --> 22:12.357
Come and get
another number.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.150
I don't think the table is straight.
I want to see Mr. Lamanski.

22:15.275 --> 22:18.942
He's not around, pal. And all losers
don't think a table is straight.

22:19.067 --> 22:21.443
I'm still right.

22:25.194 --> 22:28.736
<i>Oh, shit! Yeah? So what?
Looks like the table's fixed.</i>

22:28.861 --> 22:33.361
<i>This table's fixed! You scumbag! Hey, look
at that! That's bullshit! That's my money!</i>

22:35.571 --> 22:40.030
- Magic or magnet?
- Rudy! Rudy!

22:40.113 --> 22:43.027
Hey, you! Get outta here!

22:43.110 --> 22:45.319
Scram!
Who the fuck are you?

23:12.617 --> 23:15.116
Hey! Wait up!

23:42.077 --> 23:45.577
Guys, make sure to clean up the mess
before you knock off, okay?

24:26.252 --> 24:28.418
I'm gonna kill
that bastard.

24:35.628 --> 24:39.379
Excuse me. Could you move
to the side a little bit?

24:39.462 --> 24:42.543
- Your lights.
- Thank you.

24:50.712 --> 24:52.961
Oh, shit!

25:28.635 --> 25:31.219
It's costing us a lot of money
to get together like this...

25:31.344 --> 25:35.803
because now my time
is worth as much as yours.

25:35.928 --> 25:37.804
Worth more.

25:37.929 --> 25:41.301
- You got less of it.
- I gave you the courtesy of this talk...

25:41.425 --> 25:44.010
because you worked
for me a long time.

25:44.094 --> 25:47.885
Like I said,
close down everything and get out...

25:47.969 --> 25:50.262
or one morning you
are gonna wake up dead.

25:50.345 --> 25:54.595
Luigi, I got employees, obligations...
There's plenty for both of us.

25:54.679 --> 25:58.972
There's no "both of us. "
There's just me.

25:59.096 --> 26:03.389
- You got two days.
- And then what? Back to work for you?

26:03.472 --> 26:07.889
You don't work around here
anymore for me...

26:07.973 --> 26:10.182
or anybody.

26:13.432 --> 26:15.724
<i>Auggie, let's move one out.</i>

26:23.226 --> 26:25.351
You got it.

26:34.770 --> 26:36.894
Get down! Move it!

26:52.687 --> 26:57.145
Fucking Lamanski! Who the hell
does that son of a bitch think he is?

26:57.271 --> 26:59.313
<i>- He thinks he can take me out just like that?
- Come on!</i>

26:59.438 --> 27:01.813
That bastard's crazy!

27:01.896 --> 27:05.022
He's a fucking amateur!
He learned nothing from me!

27:05.147 --> 27:07.689
- I'm still okay, right?
- Yeah.

27:07.814 --> 27:10.648
<i>Just a waste
of fucking bullets.</i>

27:10.815 --> 27:13.232
Tony was a good kid.

27:13.314 --> 27:15.899
Make sure you get
a good replacement for him.

27:15.983 --> 27:18.483
You son of a bitch!

27:42.818 --> 27:45.860
- Hey, you got the wrong car, pal.
- Shut up.

27:45.943 --> 27:48.361
Hey, you know
who it belongs to?

27:48.486 --> 27:52.695
Yeah, a guy who is probably gonna be dead
before it's out of warranty.

28:03.321 --> 28:07.406
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you. Drive.

28:11.614 --> 28:14.948
<i>- What do you want?
- Take off all your jewelry.</i>

28:15.031 --> 28:19.324
- Do you know who bought all this stuff?
- Martin Lamanski.

28:19.408 --> 28:23.450
He has good taste in jewelry,
but you've a rotten taste in men.

28:23.534 --> 28:25.534
Come on.

28:26.576 --> 28:28.659
Gonna mess up your hair.

28:33.869 --> 28:36.161
Attagirl. Keep going.

28:58.871 --> 29:02.829
Fuckin’ shit!
You took my lunch, you son of a bitch!

29:11.789 --> 29:13.790
Good evening, sir.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.499
<i>Down.</i>

29:23.624 --> 29:27.834
- There is no down.
- Hey, I'm not a cop.

29:27.959 --> 29:29.917
I'm a player.

29:37.669 --> 29:40.544
- A martini on me.
- Get you a drink?

29:40.627 --> 29:42.751
- Oh, bartender.
- Yes, sir, a Manhattan.

29:42.834 --> 29:44.835
Yeah, another one.

29:46.126 --> 29:48.835
What do you need?

29:48.960 --> 29:51.835
Couple of minutes
with Mr. Rocca.

29:51.960 --> 29:57.129
- Not possible.
- Tell him I'm the pain in Lamanski's ass.

29:57.211 --> 30:00.628
Wait here.

30:00.754 --> 30:05.296
- You're working for Morgan and Company, right?
- Richard's supposed to meet us.

30:07.589 --> 30:10.756
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

30:11.839 --> 30:13.840
Cards?

30:19.174 --> 30:22.674
- Losing improves your character.
- Winning improves your wardrobe.

30:22.799 --> 30:25.675
<i>Again, place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

30:25.800 --> 30:28.384
<i>Cards?</i>

30:50.260 --> 30:52.719
<i>Go on in.</i>

31:06.220 --> 31:08.513
What's your name?

31:08.638 --> 31:11.056
Joseph P. Brenner...
Joey.

31:12.263 --> 31:15.514
And you're the pain
in Lamanski's ass, huh?

31:15.556 --> 31:19.515
Wasted one of his joints
and took down a couple of his bag men.

31:20.682 --> 31:23.391
And this stuff
comes from his girlfriend.

31:25.266 --> 31:27.517
What'd you bother
with that for?

31:27.642 --> 31:31.017
Intimidation.
Let him know that nothing is safe.

31:31.142 --> 31:34.268
What are you
trying to prove?

31:34.352 --> 31:38.102
Joey, this is Max Keller.

31:38.186 --> 31:41.808
Max takes care of things...
all kinds of things.

31:41.933 --> 31:46.100
- Trying to prove that maybe you can use me.
- For what?

31:46.184 --> 31:50.060
To take care of things...
all kinds of things.

31:52.101 --> 31:54.311
That job's filled.

31:54.435 --> 31:56.977
I'm sure a smart man like Mr. Rocca
is always looking to upgrade.

31:57.102 --> 32:00.228
<i>- I'm the best there is.
- Max...</i>

32:00.354 --> 32:05.188
if you're the best there is,
the wheel would've never been invented.

32:07.313 --> 32:11.189
- How'd you know I was looking for somebody?
- I didn't.

32:11.314 --> 32:13.480
I thought
I might get lucky.

32:14.606 --> 32:16.564
Where're you from?

32:19.357 --> 32:21.815
The last few years?
Miami.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.942
- Your references?
- I'm in the computer.

32:25.024 --> 32:28.525
I'm sure you can find a couple of cops
that can punch it up for you.

32:28.609 --> 32:32.776
What makes you think I'd be happy
to see Lamanski's ass kicked?

32:32.859 --> 32:38.234
You see, in Miami, we can tell everything
by the flow of the blow.

32:38.318 --> 32:42.733
This Lamanski has been making
bigger buys every week.

32:42.858 --> 32:45.275
Now, I know he has been
biting into someone's action.

32:50.193 --> 32:52.944
Go see the cashier.

32:53.027 --> 32:56.610
She'll give you a thousand dollars
in chips. Enjoy yourself.

32:56.652 --> 33:00.195
In case you forget,
I'll be checking back with you.

33:14.364 --> 33:16.948
I don't believe
a fucking word he said.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.698
Girl Scouts build character...

33:23.990 --> 33:26.824
and it's a lot cheaper.

33:26.908 --> 33:29.867
You pester me,
I'll have you tossed out.

33:29.951 --> 33:32.450
You have that kind
of clout around here?

33:32.534 --> 33:35.618
- They know me.
- I envy them.

33:35.701 --> 33:40.327
<i>- Place your bets.
- I'm sure nobody will mind if you go home before you're broke.</i>

33:40.410 --> 33:45.158
Don't trouble yourself over my money.
I always get more.

33:45.242 --> 33:49.868
Getting it somewhere else
might change your luck.

34:22.373 --> 34:24.873
Where the hell
do you think he's goin’?

34:25.916 --> 34:27.873
<i>Takira leak?</i>

34:32.751 --> 34:35.083
He's in here? Perfect!

34:37.043 --> 34:40.748
If any more guys duck down that alley,
we're gonna start sellin’ tickets.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.666
- Where'd he go?
- This way.

35:20.422 --> 35:23.340
Come on, come on!
Come on!

35:28.091 --> 35:31.133
Forget it!

35:34.093 --> 35:36.175
- Hurry up!
- Wait up!

35:43.966 --> 35:47.842
- Any trouble?
- Oh, nothing special.

35:47.924 --> 35:52.343
- All these alleys probably have rats.
- You got some I.D.?

35:52.427 --> 35:54.342
Sure.

35:55.552 --> 35:59.052
Saw those three guys
leave the hotel after ya.

35:59.177 --> 36:02.719
Anything particular
or, uh, just a mugging?

36:02.845 --> 36:05.178
They had trouble telling me
what they wanted.

36:06.386 --> 36:08.345
Yeah, I'll bet.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.887
Joseph P. Brenner.
What's the "P" stand for?

36:12.012 --> 36:13.888
Pussy.

36:17.013 --> 36:19.013
See ya around.

36:20.723 --> 36:23.598
<i>Harry, everything is
moving along fine.</i>

36:23.724 --> 36:25.682
The apartment is okay.

36:26.724 --> 36:29.683
I'm renting a car tomorrow.

36:29.766 --> 36:32.975
Something happened last night
that got me thinking.

36:33.058 --> 36:35.892
I might get into a spot
where a cop is shooting at me.

36:36.017 --> 36:38.226
Any idea how
I ought to handle it?

36:38.351 --> 36:41.391
Three back-busters jumped me.

36:41.515 --> 36:45.391
I have a feeling that Max Keller
had something to do with it.

36:45.474 --> 36:51.225
Rocca is probably checking on me
as I talk. I'll stay in touch.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.979
Hi.

37:14.062 --> 37:17.939
When was the last time
you had a good piss?

37:36.692 --> 37:38.984
Hey, let me in. I gotta take a leak.

37:40.315 --> 37:42.691
<i>- Freeze!
- Don't move!</i>

37:44.024 --> 37:46.774
- Hold it right there!
- In the back room! Cover me!

37:49.691 --> 37:52.233
- We got 'em now!
- Let's get out of here!

37:52.358 --> 37:55.067
<i>Freeze!</i>

37:55.192 --> 37:57.359
- Hey, what the...
- Hold it!

38:00.652 --> 38:02.569
<i>Throw it!</i>

38:04.111 --> 38:07.528
- You got a paper?
- I got a warrant. You got your rights.

38:07.653 --> 38:10.737
Patrovita's got
a big fuckin’ headache.

38:16.863 --> 38:21.196
Call the president.
I think we just fixed the deficit.

38:23.072 --> 38:26.240
That's $100 million
on the street.

38:26.407 --> 38:29.741
We can make it up
in a couple of weeks.

38:35.617 --> 38:38.742
Just what
Lamanski needed.

38:38.825 --> 38:43.198
If he's got a lot of shit on hand,
he's gonna step in at bargain prices...

38:43.282 --> 38:46.073
and grab a great big chunk
of the business!

38:46.198 --> 38:49.074
Well, why don't we
just take him out?

38:49.158 --> 38:52.158
Because he's
looking for it!

38:52.283 --> 38:55.367
You won't get near him now,
unless you want to start a war.

38:56.409 --> 38:58.784
Nobody needs that.

39:00.577 --> 39:02.452
Later.

39:05.077 --> 39:07.578
<i>- How many got busted?
- Eight.</i>

39:07.703 --> 39:10.411
Nobody pulled a trigger.
They'll all make bail.

39:14.580 --> 39:17.413
Have you found
a replacement for Tony?

39:17.538 --> 39:19.496
I'm looking somebody over.

39:23.914 --> 39:27.248
- I want it back.
- What?

39:27.332 --> 39:30.206
The money. The smack.
It's mine. I want it back.

39:30.290 --> 39:33.207
Oh, come on! What are we gonna do,
knock over city hall?

39:33.291 --> 39:35.625
We don't even know
where they got it stashed.

39:35.750 --> 39:38.959
But we know somebody
who can tell us.

39:39.084 --> 39:43.290
That shit is mine.
I paid for it, and I want it back.

39:46.790 --> 39:48.999
And I'm gonna get it back.

39:52.708 --> 39:55.667
How the hell is it
you never did any time?

39:55.751 --> 39:59.001
I'm smart,
unlike someone we know.

39:59.084 --> 40:02.919
Max thinks you stink
from trouble.

40:03.085 --> 40:06.711
<i>- He doesn't want you around.
- I'm sure he makes a lot of mistakes.</i>

40:06.835 --> 40:10.212
Never the same one twice.

40:10.295 --> 40:12.795
You're on.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.795
But consider yourself temporary.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.965
<i>And if Max is right,
very temporary.</i>

40:33.466 --> 40:35.466
We start tomorrow.

40:37.383 --> 40:39.717
It's nice to be
one of the family.

40:44.256 --> 40:46.882
- Get my car, please.
- Yes, sir.

40:49.424 --> 40:52.300
Sam, could you
get me a cab, please?

40:54.257 --> 40:56.217
<i>Taxi!</i>

40:57.300 --> 40:59.384
How'd you do
the other night?

40:59.468 --> 41:02.635
- Your money didn't change a thing.
- And tonight?

41:02.718 --> 41:05.093
I got out with cab fare.

41:05.177 --> 41:08.427
Maybe you should try
a different kind of recreation.

41:10.762 --> 41:13.136
Losing at tennis
wouldn't make me feel any better.

41:13.261 --> 41:15.304
The exercise might.

41:26.847 --> 41:28.973
- We don't need you.
- Thanks, pal.

41:29.098 --> 41:31.056
Okay. Thank you.

41:32.224 --> 41:35.058
You're a real
take-charge guy.

41:38.016 --> 41:41.515
Hold your glass very still.

41:47.890 --> 41:53.558
Oh. I don't know why they advertise
all those sleeping pills on television.

41:53.642 --> 41:56.558
I mean, chemicals are
no good for you.

41:59.101 --> 42:03.518
A couple of bottles of champagne
wipes you right out.

42:03.601 --> 42:05.727
Exactly.

42:08.352 --> 42:12.895
What are you sayin’?
Are you sayin’ you're ready for bed?

42:14.478 --> 42:19.646
- I think so.
- That sounds like a hell of an idea to me.

42:22.063 --> 42:25.147
Gonna help you get up.

42:25.231 --> 42:27.606
Uuh! God!

42:27.730 --> 42:29.856
- Here.
- There you go.

42:29.940 --> 42:31.940
There you go.

42:33.023 --> 42:34.982
Come on. Hurry.

42:35.108 --> 42:38.524
Oh, God!

42:40.105 --> 42:43.231
- You know what I like about bedrooms?
- No. What?

42:43.356 --> 42:46.981
You almost always
find a bed in there.

42:49.607 --> 42:51.982
You know what?

42:52.066 --> 42:55.358
I've noticed
the same thing.

43:15.028 --> 43:17.487
Oh, my God.

43:25.364 --> 43:27.322
Great.

43:40.279 --> 43:44.698
<i>I've got what there is.</i>

43:44.823 --> 43:49.615
<i>Joseph P. Brenner.
Social Security number, 567-3...</i>

43:51.032 --> 43:56.242
<i>567-34-5787</i>

43:57.783 --> 44:00.117
Dade County licence number...

44:00.200 --> 44:05.118
48736892-R.

44:07.243 --> 44:09.160
Passport number...

44:09.327 --> 44:14.537
H-1032642.

44:14.620 --> 44:17.704
Okay? He's asleep.

44:22.454 --> 44:24.746
<i>He's passed out.</i>

44:24.830 --> 44:27.789
<i>This takes care of a thousand dollars
of my I.O.U., right?</i>

44:28.830 --> 44:30.789
<i>Okay.</i>

44:30.914 --> 44:34.039
If there's something to say,
I'll call.

44:51.291 --> 44:54.207
<i>We wanted to check
your water heater today, Sarah...</i>

44:54.291 --> 44:59.332
but the, uh, keys weren’t where they were
supposed to be, so we couldn't do anything.

44:59.416 --> 45:04.334
If you tell us where the keys have been moved,
we'll come back and take care of it.

45:06.959 --> 45:09.877
Look, come back to me
as quick as you can.

45:10.003 --> 45:14.169
Yeah, you don't want
to freeze to death in that water.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.044
- Fucking little worm.
- What's his problem?

45:17.086 --> 45:19.962
We give him a million dollars
to tell us where to hit Marcellino.

45:20.087 --> 45:22.754
Now the son of a bitch
is pulling back.

45:22.879 --> 45:25.297
Well, maybe he doesn't know
where the shit is stored.

45:25.379 --> 45:31.214
How many places do you think the cops
can store that much cash and smack, huh?

45:31.298 --> 45:33.506
<i>If he doesn't know it,
he'll find out.</i>

45:33.631 --> 45:37.007
Or maybe he just doesn't like
what you're planning.

45:37.132 --> 45:40.505
I'm supposed to give a shit
what he thinks?

45:40.630 --> 45:44.463
No, he'll come across.
What the hell's his choice?

45:44.589 --> 45:47.714
<i>- He's in up to his ass.
- There's no way I can talk you out of this?</i>

45:47.797 --> 45:52.507
If you could, I shouldn't be where I am.

45:52.591 --> 45:55.799
When we start thinking
there's something we can't do...

45:55.924 --> 46:00.008
something that's too big or too messy,
then we oughta get out.

46:00.133 --> 46:03.675
This is like wrestling.
It's fixed.

46:03.800 --> 46:07.342
And the cops are always gonna lose,
and they know it.

46:21.178 --> 46:23.471
<i>I wanna hear you say
you're sorry</i>

46:23.637 --> 46:27.889
<i>Nobody takes advantage of me</i>

46:30.055 --> 46:32.347
Over here, honey.

46:32.431 --> 46:34.806
Jeanine! Over here!

46:41.555 --> 46:43.512
<i>If looks could kill</i>

46:45.054 --> 46:48.431
<i>You'd be lyin’ on the floor</i>

46:48.514 --> 46:51.347
<i>You'd be beggin’ me
Please, please</i>

46:51.472 --> 46:53.724
<i>Baby, don't you
hurt me no more</i>

46:53.807 --> 46:56.807
- Where's Metzger?
- I haven't seen him.

46:56.932 --> 46:59.558
- How's business?
- We're dying.

46:59.641 --> 47:02.391
<i>We're livin’ on the edge
Hangin’ by a thread</i>

47:02.474 --> 47:05.726
<i>I'm watchin’ every move
you make</i>

47:05.809 --> 47:08.642
<i>You don't wanna see my anger</i>

47:08.684 --> 47:10.894
<i>So don't you make
another mistake</i>

47:10.977 --> 47:12.935
That's him!

47:14.810 --> 47:19.353
<i>That's a harmless, empty threat</i>

47:21.061 --> 47:24.563
Hey! Watch it!

47:24.646 --> 47:26.520
- Stop it!
- Asshole!

47:26.645 --> 47:29.771
<i>- If looks could kill -
Do you mind? - Come on!</i>

47:29.855 --> 47:32.230
<i>- You'd be lyin’ on the floor
- Cut it out!</i>

47:32.314 --> 47:36.440
<i>- Hey, you cretin!
- You'd be beggin’ me, please, please</i>

47:36.565 --> 47:40.562
<i>- Oh, God!
- Baby, don't hurt me no more</i>

47:40.645 --> 47:43.063
Uh! No, no! No, please!

47:43.147 --> 47:45.146
<i>Come here!</i>

47:45.188 --> 47:47.189
- Help me!
- Come here!

47:49.856 --> 47:52.315
I hear you're paying off everybody
but the fucking government.

47:52.397 --> 47:55.899
- Lamanski says pay him. He'll come back with a torch.
- So you decided to pay us both.

47:55.982 --> 47:58.648
- Is that it? I didn't know you had so much loose cash.
- Just stay out of it.

47:58.732 --> 48:02.691
- No. I'm gonna close down.
- Oh, yeah? You try it, all right?

48:02.816 --> 48:05.942
<i>You piece of shit!</i>

48:08.109 --> 48:10.485
- Uh!
- Ah! Do something, huh?

48:16.902 --> 48:20.944
<i>- Oh, my God!
- This is what you're gonna look like dead.</i>

48:21.069 --> 48:23.153
<i>Don't pay Lamanski anymore.</i>

48:23.278 --> 48:26.070
If I torch this shit-house,
you'll be inside it.

48:27.820 --> 48:30.030
Get in my way again,
and I'll kill ya.

48:30.280 --> 48:32.655
I hope you're not
your mother's only child.

48:32.822 --> 48:37.031
Ohh! Oh, Mr. Metzger,
are you all right?

48:37.156 --> 48:40.236
<i>If looks could</i>

48:40.320 --> 48:42.321
<i>Kill</i>

48:44.322 --> 48:48.781
- I didn't think you were this twisted.
- Twisted? This is kid stuff.

48:48.906 --> 48:51.572
We got a call. Somebody thought
there was some trouble here.

48:51.655 --> 48:54.239
Oh, the boys were having
some trouble with their makeup.

48:54.323 --> 48:59.240
Joey P. Brenner. You turn up
in the most damnedest places.

48:59.324 --> 49:01.699
Trying to learn
my way around.

49:01.824 --> 49:05.658
Well, you got a good guide if you wanna
know your way around a sewer.

49:05.784 --> 49:08.284
<i>If looks could kill</i>

49:08.451 --> 49:12.951
- Where do you know that cop from?
- Oh, he broke up a fight I had in an alley...

49:13.035 --> 49:16.535
the night you sent your three assholes
to take me apart.

49:21.828 --> 49:23.953
<i>We don't know what his name is yet...</i>

49:24.037 --> 49:26.162
<i>but he's definitely
working for Patrovita.</i>

49:26.287 --> 49:30.621
- I don't want his name. I want his ass.
- I'll see to it he disappears.

49:32.497 --> 49:35.413
First you bust him up real good,
public and messy.

49:35.497 --> 49:38.373
Everybody should know what you get
when you kick in my door.

49:43.496 --> 49:45.622
Shit, I hate this game.

49:45.746 --> 49:49.288
This looks like
it's going to be fun.

49:49.330 --> 49:52.705
- That'd be different.
- Why? He's not a good host?

49:52.830 --> 49:55.706
Some of his friends
can be a pain in the neck.

49:55.831 --> 49:58.082
Hey, you're with
the main man.

49:58.207 --> 50:00.916
If you have any trouble, you let me know.

50:12.250 --> 50:15.877
- Wear that one.
- Beautiful, beautiful. Give it some sparkle.

50:16.002 --> 50:19.169
- Such a pretty dress.
- Oh, like this?

50:20.336 --> 50:22.253
Joey.

50:22.337 --> 50:24.670
I was hoping
you could make it.

50:24.753 --> 50:26.671
Monique.

50:26.754 --> 50:29.046
- Quite a party.
- Party?

50:29.171 --> 50:32.004
This is just a simple gathering
of the immediate family.

50:32.046 --> 50:35.255
Luigi's parties
have to be held outdoors.

50:35.339 --> 50:37.422
He wants to meet you.

50:37.506 --> 50:39.503
Be right back.

50:44.796 --> 50:48.296
Hey, you guys having fun? I'm having a lot of fun.

50:48.421 --> 50:51.422
Let's capture the moment here,
huh? Come on.

50:51.506 --> 50:56.006
Max, maybe you're
having too much fun.

50:56.090 --> 50:58.090
Eat something.

51:01.006 --> 51:05.424
- I'll get you a nice eight by ten.
- Keep it. I'm not sentimental.

51:05.508 --> 51:07.466
I didn't think so.

51:09.926 --> 51:11.884
Come in.

51:20.677 --> 51:25.053
- Joey Brenner, Luigi Patrovita.
- My pleasure.

51:28.762 --> 51:30.971
You like getting close
to our friend?

51:31.096 --> 51:33.596
You want the job
done right, don't you?

51:33.721 --> 51:36.972
- What have you found out?
- Nothing.

51:41.011 --> 51:43.136
I want you.

51:43.262 --> 51:45.262
We tried that,
remember?

51:45.345 --> 51:48.805
You come home with me,
and you owe nobody nothing.

51:48.930 --> 51:51.429
I'll owe you,
won't I?

51:51.513 --> 51:55.764
Mr. Rocca thinks you would make
a worthwhile addition...

51:55.847 --> 52:00.099
- to our various endeavors.
- I like to think so.

52:00.182 --> 52:03.432
<i>- Oh, you're a thinker.
- Sometimes.</i>

52:03.558 --> 52:05.641
Not enough to get me
into any trouble.

52:05.766 --> 52:10.350
From what we know,
you don't stay anyplace too long.

52:10.517 --> 52:14.142
If you're not part of an organization
that can protect you...

52:14.226 --> 52:19.269
- moving around is the next best thing.
- He's looking for a home.

52:21.477 --> 52:24.687
You kill anybody, Joey?

52:24.770 --> 52:26.769
Yeah.

52:29.895 --> 52:32.521
More than one?

52:32.646 --> 52:36.605
Three. You want names
and addresses?

52:46.020 --> 52:49.646
<i>Smart, I like.</i>

52:49.688 --> 52:52.188
Smart-ass, I don't.

52:55.356 --> 52:59.648
All right. Forget it. Go back to the party.
I want to talk to Mr. Rocca.

53:02.357 --> 53:04.274
Nice meeting you.

53:12.192 --> 53:14.150
I don't know.

53:18.901 --> 53:21.901
You don't let him in
too far too fast.

53:22.026 --> 53:24.902
Give him a little time
to impress us.

53:25.027 --> 53:29.862
If he doesn't, we'll use him for
something dirty and dump him in the pit.

53:29.987 --> 53:32.863
Cute, huh?

53:32.946 --> 53:34.863
What a doll.

53:45.862 --> 53:49.279
Yes, I think it would accessorize
the outfit beautifully.

53:51.029 --> 53:54.113
What do you think?
Does it make you drool?

53:54.196 --> 53:58.156
I would have picked exactly
the same one. That is my taste.

53:58.322 --> 54:01.198
Yeah? Do you like
this one better?

54:01.282 --> 54:05.699
- What do you think? Which one do you like better?
- Try it on.

54:05.782 --> 54:08.116
- You don't mind sitting here?
- No. I like it.

54:08.199 --> 54:11.283
- Okay. All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

54:11.408 --> 54:13.908
All right.

54:19.034 --> 54:23.118
- Well, this goes with the color. It's beautiful.
- Something in red?

54:23.201 --> 54:25.995
<i>Well, I think it's something...</i>

54:28.036 --> 54:29.995
<i>It's just... red.</i>

54:31.787 --> 54:34.620
Why don't you just pick one?
I'll never make up my mind.

54:34.704 --> 54:38.205
- Why don't you take them both?
- I can't afford them both.

54:40.327 --> 54:42.327
I can.

54:42.369 --> 54:45.662
Oh. You do that
too easy.

54:45.787 --> 54:48.579
You always buying things
for the ladies?

54:48.662 --> 54:53.121
- No. Not in a long time.
- Kiss her good-bye, shithead.

54:55.913 --> 54:58.456
It's a stickup.

54:58.539 --> 55:00.622
- Call security.
- Oh, really?

55:00.706 --> 55:02.457
Just dial, dipshit!

55:32.462 --> 55:34.962
We're being robbed
and beaten!

55:48.545 --> 55:50.920
Out of my way, bitch!

56:00.756 --> 56:02.839
I'm very hard to fit.

56:05.007 --> 56:07.882
- This way!
- No, this way!

56:08.007 --> 56:09.966
We're finished
shopping!

56:22.926 --> 56:25.926
Yeah? Well, come up with something!

56:26.052 --> 56:30.094
If it was possible, Luigi,
and I'm not so sure it is...

56:30.219 --> 56:32.803
it's gonna take a lot of work
to pull this thing off.

56:32.845 --> 56:36.929
- A lot of planning.
- Look. We get a floor plan.

56:37.054 --> 56:40.260
We buy ourselves
an inside man and we go.

56:40.385 --> 56:42.886
Our boy not only told me
where it is...

56:43.011 --> 56:48.054
he told me they're moving it to a federal
depository for safekeeping next Tuesday.

56:48.220 --> 56:52.054
- Oh, Jesus. This is crazy!
- Look, last week in New York...

56:52.179 --> 56:55.221
$10 million worth of cocaine
walked out of a police station.

56:55.387 --> 56:59.555
- Nobody knows where the hell it is! It can be done.
- That was inside work.

56:59.680 --> 57:03.930
I'm talking
a major fucking job here!

57:04.056 --> 57:07.806
It'll make Brinks
look like rolling a drunk.

57:07.890 --> 57:11.641
There's 50 cops in that building any hour of
the day. How you gonna get 'em outta there?

57:11.724 --> 57:14.099
Give 'em tickets
to the ball game?

57:17.225 --> 57:19.100
A bomb.

57:24.477 --> 57:27.060
Just blow the place up, huh?

57:30.227 --> 57:32.269
The genius.

57:33.269 --> 57:35.395
What are you
talking about?

57:35.479 --> 57:39.768
Bomb threat. Whenever they get one,
they have to evacuate the whole building.

57:39.851 --> 57:43.602
<i>Yeah, sure.
If they believe it.</i>

57:43.727 --> 57:47.478
They get that shit all the time.
How you gonna guarantee they'd bite?

57:47.561 --> 57:49.562
Make them nervous.

57:49.646 --> 57:54.354
Make them believe someone is trying
to blow up every police station in the city.

58:12.107 --> 58:15.233
- Hey! Where you going?
- Filling the vending machine.

58:15.358 --> 58:18.234
- Where's Bobby?
- Ha! That's what the boss would like to know.

58:18.317 --> 58:20.734
Hey, you guys bigger on
potato or corn chips?

58:20.901 --> 58:23.651
The guys in the 6th don't touch the corn.

58:23.734 --> 58:27.777
- 9th District, Sergeant Mora.
- Myself, I don't care, you know.

58:30.027 --> 58:32.278
<i>Okay, lady. Where are you?</i>

58:32.403 --> 58:34.861
<i>Anybody hurt?</i>

58:34.945 --> 58:37.946
<i>All right. Someone will be out
over there in a little while.</i>

59:22.867 --> 59:26.160
Well, it doesn't look like
they intended too much damage.

59:26.243 --> 59:29.244
There's always the chance
the guy was a bad bomb maker.

59:30.744 --> 59:34.245
- What're you doin’ here, Harry?
- Oh, just hopin’ that some...

59:34.328 --> 59:37.286
half-assed, pro-life,
whale-lovin’ terrorist didn't do it...

59:37.370 --> 59:41.284
so the bureau doesn't have to get involved,
and we can leave it in your good hands.

59:41.368 --> 59:44.452
- Hmm.
- It's crude. It's very crude.

59:44.577 --> 59:46.536
How are ya, Harry?

59:48.494 --> 59:52.370
Hello, Marvin. Yeah, I'm getting’ better.
How about yourself?

59:52.453 --> 59:56.621
- Well, complaining doesn't make any difference, huh?
- Come get a shot of this.

59:56.746 --> 59:58.913
So, what do you figure
this was?

59:59.038 --> 01:00:02.413
Well, he thinks somebody was mad
at the vending machine.

01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:05.206
Uh, look, you two kibbutz
somewhere else.

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.039
- You're impeding criminal science.
- Yes, yes, right.

01:00:08.122 --> 01:00:10.873
So, how goes
your Patrovita case?

01:00:10.957 --> 01:00:12.915
I find new angles
every day.

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:16.250
Believe me, he'll run out of options
before we run out of patience.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:19.083
- I already have.
- Nobody can blame you.

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:21.084
Somebody said
they took you off this case.

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:25.459
Well, they don't control
all the hours of my day.

01:00:25.543 --> 01:00:30.168
Don't mess around, Harry. We might have
something workin’ that you don't know about.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:34.837
My guess is that whatever
you've got workin’... won't work.

01:00:34.962 --> 01:00:36.877
We're doin’ all we can.

01:00:36.961 --> 01:00:39.251
Great. So am I.

01:00:39.376 --> 01:00:44.751
I know with you it's personal, but we're
both after the same thing... justice.

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.585
Right, Harry?
Justice.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.460
Fuck justice!

01:00:53.045 --> 01:00:55.586
<i>Allow me.</i>

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:58.004
There you go.

01:00:58.088 --> 01:01:00.004
<i>I don't really
want to lose you</i>

01:01:00.088 --> 01:01:02.296
<i>But I don't want to go</i>

01:01:04.172 --> 01:01:07.547
What's new on
the domestic front?

01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:10.756
I don't have the report
typed out yet.

01:01:10.881 --> 01:01:14.507
<i>I can tell the way they act
and their attitude</i>

01:01:14.632 --> 01:01:18.550
Remember that horse we used to look at?
I bought it.

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:20.925
What's on your mind, Max?

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.925
You.

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:25.509
What can he do for you
I can't?

01:01:25.634 --> 01:01:28.218
This was your idea,
not mine.

01:01:28.343 --> 01:01:31.093
Well, I didn't expect it
to go this far.

01:01:31.176 --> 01:01:33.219
How far has it gone?

01:01:34.636 --> 01:01:37.302
Does he climb into your pants
five times a day?

01:01:37.386 --> 01:01:39.300
Is that what you wanna hear?

01:01:39.426 --> 01:01:42.592
Not really.
I'd like to know it was me.

01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:47.927
The only way you'll ever end up lying next
to me is if we're run down by the same car.

01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:52.219
I like it when
you hurt me, baby.

01:01:52.344 --> 01:01:55.220
Myself...

01:01:55.303 --> 01:01:57.928
I'd rather give
than receive.

01:01:58.053 --> 01:02:00.430
Wrong.

01:02:00.596 --> 01:02:03.888
<i>Ever think about
ever settling down</i>

01:02:03.971 --> 01:02:06.431
Max...

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:10.889
I don't think we're going to be
the kind of pals I hoped we'd be.

01:02:13.141 --> 01:02:15.056
<i>If a tear rolls from my eyes</i>

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.182
<i>I feel the hurt inside</i>

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.725
<i>As I reach out to you</i>

01:02:19.808 --> 01:02:22.308
I'm impressed.

01:02:22.433 --> 01:02:24.434
I'm hungry.

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:26.809
<i>I can't get out
You see, I'm tied</i>

01:02:26.934 --> 01:02:32.019
<i>- The more we know each other,
the less you wanna see me.</i>

01:02:32.144 --> 01:02:35.769
Is this an approach you developed yourself,
or something you read in a book?

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:38.436
These guys from the dress shop
are going to be back...

01:02:38.561 --> 01:02:40.975
and I don't want you around
when they do.

01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:50.269
I like you.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:55.020
Maybe more than you like me.
I don't know.

01:02:56.853 --> 01:03:00.645
Unless you're gonna tell me you're married
or something, I'm not staying away.

01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:11.315
You're married?

01:03:11.397 --> 01:03:14.149
For a long time.

01:03:23.525 --> 01:03:25.442
Where is she?

01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:27.734
Far away from here.

01:03:32.193 --> 01:03:34.193
Well...

01:03:35.235 --> 01:03:37.111
that's a relief.

01:03:37.236 --> 01:03:39.108
I thought I lost it.

01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:42.191
All this great equipment,
and you're sitting on your hands.

01:03:42.317 --> 01:03:45.735
I was telling myself, "He's a slow starter,
but it gets hot when he gets going. "

01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:48.901
You're important to me.
You are a friend.

01:03:49.027 --> 01:03:51.193
<i>- You're more than a friend.
- "Friend. "</i>

01:03:51.277 --> 01:03:54.944
<i>- You're more than that.
- We're friends.</i>

01:03:56.445 --> 01:03:59.028
When I wanna make friends,
I'll go to summer camp.

01:04:11.072 --> 01:04:13.406
You wanna hear
something funny?

01:04:14.448 --> 01:04:16.781
I was sort of flattered.

01:04:16.948 --> 01:04:19.782
I thought you were going slow because
you thought this was real important...

01:04:19.866 --> 01:04:21.866
and you didn't
wanna blow it.

01:04:30.743 --> 01:04:35.076
It's gonna take me a long time to figure out
which of us is the biggest asshole.

01:04:45.409 --> 01:04:49.118
<i>God! They don't make 'em like that anymore.</i>

01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:02.871
The whole thing
could blow up.

01:05:02.954 --> 01:05:05.954
Patrovita's gonna get Lamanski.

01:05:05.996 --> 01:05:09.788
As long as they keep cutting down
the right people, I don't give a shit.

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:13.581
Patrovita wants the money and the dope
the cops got when they raided him.

01:05:13.706 --> 01:05:15.623
And he's gonna try
and get it.

01:05:15.706 --> 01:05:17.624
You're kidding.

01:05:21.582 --> 01:05:23.499
You know what happens
if we stop this?

01:05:23.625 --> 01:05:27.750
Yeah. Since I'm the new boy,
they must figure that I'm the leak.

01:05:27.833 --> 01:05:31.417
Let 'em have it.
This is not the reason we're in this.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.543
- What about Lamanski?
- Considering how we're involved in this...

01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:37.543
I can't be of much
help to you, Mark.

01:05:37.627 --> 01:05:40.833
You're gonna have to
watch out for yourself.

01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:44.250
You want out?

01:05:50.792 --> 01:05:52.877
I started to call Amy
last night.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.418
- I wanted her to know that I'm still alive.
- Dangerous.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:58.212
Yeah. But I've
put her through a lot.

01:05:58.295 --> 01:06:02.253
But if we stop now,
the whole thing is for nothing.

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:04.754
And knowing Amy...

01:06:04.837 --> 01:06:07.545
she probably
will kill me herself.

01:06:12.756 --> 01:06:14.756
Are you gonna stick?

01:06:17.798 --> 01:06:20.840
This Joey has
a pretty good life.

01:06:21.007 --> 01:06:25.549
Expensive clothes,
a nice car...

01:06:25.633 --> 01:06:28.634
lots of money
and free time.

01:06:30.634 --> 01:06:32.926
I never had it so good.

01:06:34.968 --> 01:06:37.093
Just don't let it go
to your head, all right?

01:06:42.258 --> 01:06:44.133
That's kind of sudden.

01:06:44.257 --> 01:06:46.133
You don't work good
on short notice?

01:06:46.258 --> 01:06:48.760
Nothing works
if it isn't thought out.

01:06:48.843 --> 01:06:50.967
They hit the 3rd District
in an hour.

01:06:51.092 --> 01:06:53.718
We'll waste Lamanski
as a diversion.

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:55.802
It's my idea.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:59.677
What do you think?

01:06:59.803 --> 01:07:01.845
I'll let you know
when it's over.

01:07:21.139 --> 01:07:23.140
We're ready.

01:07:35.226 --> 01:07:37.143
3rd District,
Sergeant Washington.

01:07:37.227 --> 01:07:42.557
You've got a bomb
inside the building.

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:46.683
It goes off in 22 minutes.

01:07:48.892 --> 01:07:50.851
All right.
Everything's jammed.

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:01.895
We have a bomb.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.019
Call Bomb Disposal.

01:08:04.144 --> 01:08:06.978
Clear the building.

01:08:14.897 --> 01:08:16.854
Bomb Disposal.

01:08:19.148 --> 01:08:23.774
Evacuate and barricade a perimeter
of 300 feet from the building.

01:08:23.856 --> 01:08:25.816
We're on the way.

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:27.816
We're go.

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:29.941
So are we.

01:08:31.817 --> 01:08:35.234
<i>Clear those people! Come on!</i>

01:08:43.566 --> 01:08:45.483
<i>Come on. Let's keep moving.</i>

01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:47.983
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go!

01:08:50.317 --> 01:08:53.067
Let's go! Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:08:55.151 --> 01:08:59.276
Watch out! Watch where you're going!

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:03.487
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:07.779
It's right down here.

01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:12.738
Torch!

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:15.863
<i>Come on!</i>

01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:27.198
You see him?
Lamanski.

01:09:28.948 --> 01:09:31.741
<i>Take him when he's clear.</i>

01:09:35.408 --> 01:09:37.908
<i>Shit! No way.</i>

01:09:37.993 --> 01:09:39.907
Where the fuck did all
those people come from?

01:09:39.991 --> 01:09:41.865
Maybe they play bingo.

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:45.700
Do you own a calendar, Max?
I bet it's a Jewish holiday.

01:09:45.825 --> 01:09:49.075
<i>Yeah, well, for his sake,
it better be the Day of Atonement.</i>

01:09:49.158 --> 01:09:51.242
We'll follow him
and take him when we can.

01:10:16.664 --> 01:10:19.914
<i>All right. That's it.
He's ready. Outta here.</i>

01:10:20.081 --> 01:10:21.998
We're set.

01:10:27.124 --> 01:10:30.083
Oh, shit.

01:10:31.916 --> 01:10:34.208
That's good.

01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:36.458
Guys, we're on the clock.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.790
- Come on.
- Here, fill this one.

01:10:58.918 --> 01:11:01.835
<i>When we get to the expressway,
I'm gonna run him off the road.</i>

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.169
Their car is much
heavier than ours.

01:11:04.295 --> 01:11:06.545
Won’t matter
if you hit the driver.

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:41.890
Run 'em into the wall.

01:13:44.815 --> 01:13:47.356
Let's get outta here!

01:13:54.858 --> 01:13:57.817
<i>Wave your hands!</i>

01:14:04.985 --> 01:14:08.652
- Let's go, let's go.
- This is it. Let's make it look good.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.320
Open the doors!

01:14:11.361 --> 01:14:13.278
- Clear!
- What happened in there?

01:14:13.403 --> 01:14:15.529
Stay clear!

01:14:37.532 --> 01:14:39.655
I don't know who in the hell
this guy is.

01:14:39.781 --> 01:14:43.364
- I've never seen him before.
- No mistake?

01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:48.531
Come on. Three years ago,
I busted Joey Brenner twice in two weeks.

01:14:49.574 --> 01:14:51.532
And that ain't him.

01:14:54.116 --> 01:14:56.116
You know where he is?

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.201
Caribbean, I heard.

01:15:05.786 --> 01:15:08.160
When do you go back
to Miami?

01:15:08.285 --> 01:15:10.495
In an hour.

01:15:13.203 --> 01:15:16.954
I've got a charity softball game with
Dade County Sheriffs in the morning.

01:15:17.038 --> 01:15:19.954
Cops against cops.

01:15:20.038 --> 01:15:22.497
You leave me no one
to root for.

01:15:25.538 --> 01:15:27.498
So what the fuck are you
doing for the money?

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:31.331
- Sticking my ass out.
- Not far enough!

01:15:32.624 --> 01:15:35.874
Somebody got somebody inside.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.330
He's walking
all over the place.

01:15:38.455 --> 01:15:41.164
He's even been to my house.

01:15:41.289 --> 01:15:43.872
He could be banging my wife,
for Christ's sake!

01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:47.415
He didn't get by me.
I don't know how the hell he got there.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:50.040
What the hell's the difference?
We got him, right?

01:15:50.123 --> 01:15:52.957
Don't give me that "we" shit!
Max turned him up on his own.

01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:56.166
What do you want?
I can't tell you things I don't know about.

01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:59.000
Well, what do
you know about?

01:16:00.751 --> 01:16:02.876
You're telling me
about this bureau creep...

01:16:03.001 --> 01:16:05.710
who's trying to take me apart
in his spare time...

01:16:05.835 --> 01:16:09.669
because his kid got smacked
when we took Marcellino.

01:16:09.794 --> 01:16:12.462
So what's the good news?

01:16:12.544 --> 01:16:16.212
I had a friend at the bureau
check Harry Shannon’s case files.

01:16:16.337 --> 01:16:20.295
Whatever he's doing is unofficial.
There aren't any records.

01:16:21.921 --> 01:16:26.880
If he were killed, there could be
no direct connection to you.

01:16:29.173 --> 01:16:33.590
Oh. That's the good news, huh?

01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:36.466
So who's gonna do it?
You?

01:16:39.421 --> 01:16:41.422
Brenner.

01:16:45.005 --> 01:16:48.340
Yeah.

01:16:50.798 --> 01:16:52.674
I think I'd better
get going.

01:16:52.799 --> 01:16:55.342
Yeah? Where?
Canada? Mexico?

01:16:55.466 --> 01:16:58.217
You're not getting out of my sight
until this is over and done.

01:16:58.342 --> 01:17:02.550
If you did some serious damage
to my organization...

01:17:02.676 --> 01:17:05.426
I wanna know where
I can lay my hands on you.

01:17:27.055 --> 01:17:28.931
I'll be right back.

01:17:29.056 --> 01:17:32.515
- Hey! We can't be late!
- Just a minute!

01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:36.807
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:39.179
Sorry for the other night.

01:17:39.263 --> 01:17:43.264
<i>- Where would I learn how to deal with a friend?
- It's okay.</i>

01:17:43.389 --> 01:17:45.889
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:17:45.972 --> 01:17:48.139
I was thinking
maybe we could talk.

01:17:48.223 --> 01:17:50.640
I have
something to do.

01:17:50.723 --> 01:17:53.558
<i>- Maybe later?
- Sure.</i>

01:17:53.682 --> 01:17:55.933
<i>Take my car and go home.</i>

01:17:56.058 --> 01:17:59.975
I'll call you as soon
as I get back. Okay?

01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:13.311
Watch yourself.

01:18:14.395 --> 01:18:17.311
Don't worry.

01:19:21.904 --> 01:19:25.529
<i>- You gonna tell me who it is?
- A cop.</i>

01:19:25.612 --> 01:19:27.822
Just a fucking cop.

01:19:29.156 --> 01:19:31.197
Go straight at him.

01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:33.406
I'll take the far side.

01:19:54.031 --> 01:19:57.575
<i>Wherefore my heart is glad
and my spirit rejoices...</i>

01:19:57.699 --> 01:20:01.450
<i>my flesh also shall
rest in hope.</i>

01:20:01.575 --> 01:20:03.950
<i>Thou shalt show me
the path of life.</i>

01:20:04.075 --> 01:20:06.867
<i>In thy presence
is the fullness of joy,;</i>

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:11.535
<i>and at thy right hand
there is pleasure for evermore.</i>

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:14.493
<i>In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection and eternal life...</i>

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:17.245
through our Lord
Jesus Christ...

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:21.579
<i>we commend to Almighty God
our brother, William Dunne...</i>

01:20:21.704 --> 01:20:23.996
<i>and we commit his body
to the ground,;</i>

01:20:24.079 --> 01:20:28.955
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.289
<i>The Lord bless him,
keep him.</i>

01:20:31.413 --> 01:20:33.914
The Lord make his face
to shine upon him...

01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:36.415
<i>and be gracious upon him.</i>

01:20:38.454 --> 01:20:40.496
- Harry!
- Waste him!

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:06.625
Harry, I didn't know it was you.

01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:09.209
That's all right.

01:21:09.293 --> 01:21:12.710
- Go on and get out of here.
- I'm gonna get the ambulance for you.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:15.085
It'll come.
Now you go on, beat it.

01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:17.544
If the cops take you
and I don't make it...

01:21:17.627 --> 01:21:19.711
you'll be years
explaining this.

01:21:19.836 --> 01:21:21.754
Harry, don't die.

01:21:21.837 --> 01:21:24.129
<i>- It's not over.
- Then go on.</i>

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:26.296
Go on, get out of here.
Beat it.

01:21:26.379 --> 01:21:29.297
- I'll see you soon, okay? I'll see you.
- Go on!

01:21:57.882 --> 01:22:00.799
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Saving your ass.

01:22:24.762 --> 01:22:27.803
Okay. Pack whatever
you can't live without.

01:22:27.928 --> 01:22:30.221
Go to the Rock Falls Airport
and charter a plane.

01:22:30.347 --> 01:22:32.597
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

01:22:32.722 --> 01:22:35.930
To do what an old friend
asked me to do...

01:22:36.014 --> 01:22:37.928
knock 'em dead.

01:22:48.597 --> 01:22:51.097
<i>Did I mention the pit?</i>

01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:54.723
<i>Yeah, that's the gravel pit.
It's owned by Patrovita.</i>

01:22:54.848 --> 01:22:57.098
<i>You get an invitation,
don't go.</i>

01:22:57.223 --> 01:23:00.682
<i>Bustin’ rocks is only some
of what goes on out there.</i>

01:25:48.788 --> 01:25:51.330
We got company.

01:25:52.455 --> 01:25:54.914
Which way?
I don't see nothin’.

01:25:57.123 --> 01:25:59.706
<i>I can't get no</i>

01:25:59.790 --> 01:26:03.040
<i>Satisfaction</i>

01:26:04.124 --> 01:26:07.291
I can't get no

01:26:07.416 --> 01:26:09.792
Satisfaction

01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:13.000
'Cause I try, and I try

01:26:13.084 --> 01:26:17.543
And I try, and I try

01:26:17.626 --> 01:26:19.918
I can't get no

01:26:20.043 --> 01:26:23.461
I can't get no

01:26:23.627 --> 01:26:26.253
<i>When I'm drivin’ in my car</i>

01:26:26.378 --> 01:26:30.504
And a man
comes on the radio

01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:34.504
<i>He's telling me
more and more</i>

01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:38.502
<i>- About some useless information
- Billy, outside! Let's go!</i>

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:41.545
<i>Supposed to fire
my imagination</i>

01:26:41.628 --> 01:26:44.670
<i>I can't get no</i>

01:26:44.795 --> 01:26:47.629
No, no, no

01:26:47.754 --> 01:26:50.130
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:26:50.255 --> 01:26:52.672
<i>That's what I say</i>

01:26:56.588 --> 01:26:59.840
I can't get no

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:03.048
Satisfaction

01:27:03.215 --> 01:27:06.757
<i>I can't get no</i>

01:27:06.882 --> 01:27:09.258
Satisfaction

01:27:09.341 --> 01:27:12.717
'Cause I try, and I try

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.509
And I try, and I try

01:27:16.634 --> 01:27:19.301
I can't get no

01:27:19.427 --> 01:27:21.385
I can't get no

01:27:22.844 --> 01:27:26.303
When I'm watchin’ my TV

01:27:26.428 --> 01:27:30.220
And a man
comes on and tells me

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:33.470
<i>How white my shirts
can be</i>

01:27:33.595 --> 01:27:35.721
But he can't be a man

01:27:35.887 --> 01:27:39.094
'Cause he doesn't smoke
the same...

01:29:50.154 --> 01:29:52.529
What exactly happened here
is unclear.

01:29:52.613 --> 01:29:56.571
Police speculate, based on the amount
of heroin and money found on the scene...

01:29:56.696 --> 01:29:59.072
this may be the result
of a brewing mob war.

01:29:59.156 --> 01:30:01.155
Mob war my ass!

01:30:02.156 --> 01:30:04.531
Brenner!

01:30:04.656 --> 01:30:07.740
We don't know where
the son of a bitch is.

01:30:07.823 --> 01:30:09.741
Let's hope
he's not alive.

01:30:09.824 --> 01:30:13.241
From the looks of that mess,
I'd say he was dead.

01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:15.241
I think he's right.

01:30:15.325 --> 01:30:17.409
Don't think, pray!

01:30:17.492 --> 01:30:20.075
If he's still alive,
you're not!

01:30:21.117 --> 01:30:24.660
Oh, shit!

01:30:28.119 --> 01:30:32.286
- Let's get him before he gets us! The elevators!
- Give me an extra clip.

01:30:32.411 --> 01:30:35.120
You! Stick around.

01:30:51.287 --> 01:30:53.204
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it!

01:30:55.495 --> 01:30:57.538
Eh?

01:31:12.958 --> 01:31:14.665
<i>What?</i>

01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:17.542
<i>Move!</i>

01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:23.834
Get down!

01:32:11.007 --> 01:32:13.341
Shit!

01:32:18.008 --> 01:32:19.550
He got me!

01:32:36.094 --> 01:32:38.343
Oh, shit!

01:32:45.511 --> 01:32:47.469
<i>Come on!</i>

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.303
<i>Come on!</i>

01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:12.848
Fuck!

01:33:27.477 --> 01:33:29.102
Damn it!

01:33:36.019 --> 01:33:38.309
Oh, damn it!

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:46.019
- Come on!
- Get the son of a bitch!

01:33:51.645 --> 01:33:54.478
<i>Come on, man!
Just you and me!</i>

01:33:54.603 --> 01:33:57.604
<i>Come on!
Show yourself!</i>

01:34:11.357 --> 01:34:13.273
- Now what?
- Call the cops.

01:34:13.357 --> 01:34:15.524
<i>- What?
- Call the fucking cops!</i>

01:34:22.693 --> 01:34:26.109
For God's sakes, let it...

01:35:14.031 --> 01:35:15.949
Kaminski?

01:35:16.032 --> 01:35:19.949
This must be what they mean
by "poetic justice. "

01:35:22.325 --> 01:35:25.158
This is... isn't what you think.
I'm with the government.

01:35:25.284 --> 01:35:28.159
I set every one
of these guys up, and...

01:35:28.243 --> 01:35:32.034
So, back with the bureau, huh?
I didn't know that.

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:34.286
It's, uh...

01:35:34.369 --> 01:35:37.616
You know, that whole thing
was such a mistake. You and I...

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.158
Because of you,
a lot of people are dead.

01:35:41.242 --> 01:35:43.410
And now it's your turn.

01:35:43.492 --> 01:35:46.994
No. No.

01:35:52.995 --> 01:35:56.744
Resign or be prosecuted.

01:35:56.869 --> 01:35:58.829
Any way you want it.

01:36:24.125 --> 01:36:25.875
Excuse me.
We're coming through.

01:36:25.917 --> 01:36:28.917
<i>Pardon me.</i>

01:36:30.209 --> 01:36:32.710
<i>Shit!</i>

01:36:34.127 --> 01:36:35.961
<i>All right.
Careful. Careful. Watch it.</i>

01:36:36.128 --> 01:36:39.125
- Okay, Lenny.
- They said you got room for one more, right?

01:36:39.208 --> 01:36:42.500
<i>- Watch your back.
- What do you think Baxter was doing here?</i>

01:36:42.584 --> 01:36:45.625
Until I know different,
I gotta assume our leak's just been plugged.

01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:48.502
- Pardon the pun.
- What the hell you think happened here?

01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:53.127
I think somebody
got very pissed off.

01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:56.461
- Who?
- I got a good idea.

01:36:56.545 --> 01:36:59.628
Baker, just got a location on the car.

01:36:59.753 --> 01:37:05.046
- Give it to me.
- A 1979 Oldsmobile registered to Luigi Patrovita...

01:37:05.171 --> 01:37:07.046
moving south on Route 84.

01:37:07.171 --> 01:37:09.047
- Should they intercept?
- No. Negative.

01:37:09.172 --> 01:37:12.256
- Tell them to track him. Keep
me up on where he is. - Ten-four.

01:37:14.382 --> 01:37:16.756
Where are you going?

01:37:16.882 --> 01:37:19.382
I'm gonna see
how smart I am.

01:37:45.676 --> 01:37:47.843
Get on the plane.

01:37:47.926 --> 01:37:49.885
You okay?

01:37:57.928 --> 01:38:01.053
- You're not going, are you?
- No.

01:38:01.137 --> 01:38:03.054
Then I'm not either.

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.470
You're out of excuses,
sweetheart.

01:38:05.596 --> 01:38:07.972
There's a quarter million dollars
in that bag.

01:38:08.055 --> 01:38:10.930
Win or lose,
it's your choice.

01:38:11.055 --> 01:38:13.181
Now get out of here.

01:38:16.806 --> 01:38:18.807
You'll be okay,
won't you?

01:38:30.017 --> 01:38:32.643
Get going.

01:39:29.442 --> 01:39:31.400
I'm glad you didn't
make me chase you.

01:39:31.525 --> 01:39:34.276
Too damn tired.

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:38.399
That doesn't surprise me. A hundred years
of police work in a single afternoon.

01:39:39.733 --> 01:39:42.233
<i>Always figured
you were one of us.</i>

01:39:45.984 --> 01:39:48.443
How many days in a row...

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:53.069
do I have to haul
your butt down here?

01:39:55.194 --> 01:39:57.903
Just to watch you
do nothing.

01:39:57.944 --> 01:40:00.070
I have no interest...

01:40:00.195 --> 01:40:03.820
in becoming
an accomplished cripple.

01:40:03.904 --> 01:40:07.862
Now you push me back to my room
or out into traffic. I don't give a shit.

01:40:09.113 --> 01:40:11.072
Things not so good, Harry?

01:40:15.822 --> 01:40:18.698
- I've seen better days.
- Wanna see 'em again?

01:40:18.823 --> 01:40:21.240
Won’t happen from down here.

01:40:24.325 --> 01:40:27.866
So, you used to being back
with the bureau?

01:40:28.033 --> 01:40:30.117
Sure.

01:40:30.242 --> 01:40:32.117
And back with my wife.

01:40:32.241 --> 01:40:34.201
Thank you very much.

01:40:37.573 --> 01:40:39.699
Come on, Mark!
Stop fooling around!

01:40:39.823 --> 01:40:41.741
Give me...
Give me my chair.

01:40:44.491 --> 01:40:46.367
I need your help, Harry.

01:40:46.492 --> 01:40:48.576
For what?
Where's my chair?

01:40:48.701 --> 01:40:51.701
My reunion with Amy
was a big success.

01:40:53.743 --> 01:40:55.744
We just found out
that she's pregnant.

01:40:55.869 --> 01:40:57.744
That's great.
That's great.

01:40:57.869 --> 01:40:59.703
Give me my chair.

01:40:59.786 --> 01:41:02.578
I don't know anything
about being a father, Harry.

01:41:02.662 --> 01:41:05.120
I want your help.
I want you to be the godfather.

01:41:05.245 --> 01:41:07.788
All right. I'll help.
Now give me the goddamn chair!

01:41:07.913 --> 01:41:10.746
- Then walk.
- I can't walk!

01:41:10.871 --> 01:41:13.997
Then meet me halfway.
Come on.

01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:16.705
I don't have to walk
to be a godfather!

01:41:16.872 --> 01:41:20.207
You don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.

01:41:25.625 --> 01:41:28.625
- I can't!
- Did you ever quit in front of Blair?
