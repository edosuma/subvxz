00:38.680 --> 00:41.666
Please come, it's warm inside.

00:41.766 --> 00:44.545
I have already made a fire
for you.

00:44.892 --> 00:47.581
Oh! That's better.

00:50.163 --> 00:52.043
Toby, be a dear and shut the door,

00:52.363 --> 00:54.643
otherwise we'll all catch our
deaths.

00:56.403 --> 00:59.541
What a gloomy thought,
catch our deaths.

00:59.641 --> 01:03.375
Yes, Mummy, we're here for a two-week
holiday, let's keep things jolly, eh?

01:03.563 --> 01:05.763
I shouldn't worry about it,
it's only a saying.

01:06.117 --> 01:07.763
Though it is rather dim in here.

01:07.872 --> 01:10.632
Here, let me.

01:11.921 --> 01:14.840
Oh! It looks bigger than it did
in the brochure.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.419
Well, better that than
the other way round.

01:17.663 --> 01:20.717
Do you remember that awful hotel we
stayed in in Greece?

01:20.954 --> 01:22.839
It wasn't so bad, I rather liked it,

01:23.135 --> 01:26.351
though as I recall the local tipple
was fairly wretched.

01:28.101 --> 01:29.781
Do you remember it, Cathy?

01:30.083 --> 01:32.979
No, I wasn't married to Julian then,

01:33.580 --> 01:36.301
it must have been when Elizabeth
was still alive.

01:37.385 --> 01:39.069
How are you feeling, darling?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.480
That pilot gave us one hell of
a bumpy landing.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.385
Fine.
I'm fine.

01:43.512 --> 01:46.691
Well, no skiing for you,
not in your condition.

01:46.963 --> 01:49.424
We'll have the slopes all to
ourselves, won't we, Toby?

01:49.550 --> 01:51.436
I'm not sure I want to ski.

01:51.536 --> 01:53.003
Boring.

01:53.127 --> 01:56.980
Toby, your father went to a
lot of trouble to book this holiday,

01:57.080 --> 01:59.451
you really ought not to be so
ungrateful.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.557
You spoil him, Cathy.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.997
All these treats and indulgences.

02:04.126 --> 02:06.905
You're getting him used
to having his own way.

02:07.272 --> 02:09.902
There, I've said it.
- Please, Mummy, let's not argue,

02:10.002 --> 02:11.246
we've only just arrived.

02:11.355 --> 02:14.531
Here, some refreshment for you.

02:14.670 --> 02:19.050
This is gluhwein,
traditional Austrian drink.

02:19.150 --> 02:21.449
Oh, good, I'm parched.

02:24.763 --> 02:27.243
Lovely.
Danke schoen.

02:27.365 --> 02:29.858
Sorry, no wine for you, darling.

02:30.255 --> 02:32.568
It's fine, I'm not thirsty, anyway.

02:32.668 --> 02:35.294
We need rest and plenty of it.
Doctor's orders, remember?

02:35.394 --> 02:38.348
I will, I'll have plenty of rest
and do nothing at all.

02:38.448 --> 02:40.970
Well, there's a surprise.
- It's perfect.

02:41.371 --> 02:45.087
Absolutely perfect.
- You're not too angry I invited Mummy?

02:45.483 --> 02:48.286
It's your money, darling,
I can't tell you how to spend it.

02:48.386 --> 02:49.587
Eurgh!

02:49.687 --> 02:52.204
Toby?
What is it?

02:52.456 --> 02:54.403
Horrible picture.

02:57.153 --> 03:00.004
Good grief, the Devil of Christmas.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.443
What's all this about, then, Claus?

03:04.299 --> 03:07.771
Krampus.
This is a local legend.

03:07.871 --> 03:10.856
'Oh, I just want to point
out a continuity error,

03:10.956 --> 03:12.358
can we whizz it back?

03:12.778 --> 03:17.141
'OK. It's just occurred to me
now, seeing the Krampus picture,

03:17.241 --> 03:20.910
'but if you look by the front door
as they all troop in,

03:21.542 --> 03:23.406
'there it is again, see?

03:23.506 --> 03:27.752
'Oh, yeah. Sorry, could you just introduce
yourself so people know who you are?'

03:27.852 --> 03:32.299
'Oh, yes, I'm Dennis Fulcher, and I
was the director of this piece.

03:32.399 --> 03:35.852
'Now, see, what happened was we
started filming when we noticed

03:35.952 --> 03:38.006
'up in the gallery that the painting

03:38.106 --> 03:41.569
'had been set in the wrong place
by the bloody art department.

03:41.669 --> 03:45.301
'Luckily, it was a long scene so I
sent a stagehand down to move it.

03:45.401 --> 03:46.761
'See? There it is.

03:46.861 --> 03:50.083
'And, as Celia crosses over,
it's gone.

03:50.548 --> 03:53.417
'Oh, yeah, I never noticed.
- 'No, people don't.

03:54.003 --> 03:56.396
'Meanwhile, the stagehand is
creeping round

03:56.496 --> 03:58.162
'to rehang it above the fireplace.

03:59.107 --> 04:02.128
'You can see here that the little
boy was a bit distracted.

04:02.228 --> 04:03.817
'Look at the way he's looking.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.324
'But, otherwise, I think we got
away with it.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.166
'And this was all filmed in one day?

04:09.266 --> 04:11.125
'Yes, one day. Three cameras.

04:11.232 --> 04:14.493
'Unless someone bumps into the
furniture you would just carry on.

04:14.593 --> 04:17.286
'They film Doctors in much
the same way even now.'

04:17.387 --> 04:19.904
.. must have been when Elizabeth was
still alive.

04:20.523 --> 04:21.875
How are you feeling, darling?

04:21.975 --> 04:24.358
'The whole pregnancy thing was
my idea.

04:24.458 --> 04:26.721
'I thought it would tee up
the ending.

04:26.854 --> 04:28.937
'If you sense there was something

04:29.037 --> 04:33.174
INSIDE Cathy making it more poignant
'in a way.'

04:33.274 --> 04:35.650
I'm not sure I want to ski.
Boring.

04:36.236 --> 04:40.137
Toby, your father went to a
lot of trouble to book this holiday.

04:40.237 --> 04:42.782
You really ought not to be so
ungrateful.

04:43.243 --> 04:45.353
'Nancy there, looking for her mark,

04:45.453 --> 04:48.442
'her eyes were going by this stage.
Bless her.

04:48.665 --> 04:51.610
Nancy?
- Nancy Mason, dead now, of course.'

04:51.710 --> 04:54.408
Let's not argue.
We've only just arrived.

04:54.508 --> 04:57.658
Here, some refreshment for you.

04:57.758 --> 05:01.963
'Oh, look at that, three glasses of
watered-down Ribena.

05:02.063 --> 05:03.439
'Terrible!

05:03.678 --> 05:05.878
'I very nearly didn't do this film.

05:06.164 --> 05:09.578
'But there was so little work around
I felt I couldn't say no.

05:09.741 --> 05:13.040
'The week before I'd had a meeting
about Worzel Gummidge,

05:13.140 --> 05:17.241
'but Pertwee had his favourites,
I knew that from Who.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.627
'Can we spin it on a bit?

05:19.727 --> 05:21.072
'Say when.'

05:23.268 --> 05:25.161
'There.
You see?

05:25.301 --> 05:27.893
'It's finally in the right place.'

05:28.403 --> 05:31.721
The 6th of December is
Saint Nicholas Day.

05:32.131 --> 05:36.623
Saint Nicholas brings treats for
the good boys and girls, but...

05:36.735 --> 05:39.407
'Ralph Cosgrove, lovely actor,

05:39.507 --> 05:43.982
'always thought he had a Prospero in him,
but I don't think he ever pursued it.'

05:44.483 --> 05:48.141
Here he is, in the clutch of the Krampus,

05:48.241 --> 05:50.440
even the most unholy child

05:50.540 --> 05:53.744
will promise to turn from his
wicked ways.

05:54.083 --> 05:58.161
We had a nanny rather like that.
- Oh, Julian, don't exaggerate.

05:58.261 --> 06:02.389
So, he is the dark side of Santa
Claus, a sort of Jekyll & Hyde?

06:02.489 --> 06:06.563
The Krampus walks the streets
for three nights.

06:06.663 --> 06:11.098
If you hear the cowbells you will
know he is close by.

06:11.618 --> 06:14.641
On the first night,
if you have been bad,

06:14.741 --> 06:17.738
you will find a switch in your shoe.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.174
Like a light switch?

06:19.276 --> 06:22.551
No, Toby, a switch is a rod or
a twig used for whipping horses.

06:22.651 --> 06:24.857
Or naughty little boys.

06:25.083 --> 06:28.232
It is a warning to mend your manners.

06:28.450 --> 06:31.772
On the second night, if you're still bad,

06:31.897 --> 06:35.146
the Krampus will leave his mark upon you.

06:35.523 --> 06:38.412
You will wake up with scratches

06:38.537 --> 06:41.210
where he has visited you
in the night.

06:42.336 --> 06:45.416
And on the third night, my God,

06:45.981 --> 06:48.200
if you're still not mended,

06:48.363 --> 06:50.822
he will come for you.

06:50.922 --> 06:53.080
'It goes on a bit, this speech.'

06:53.340 --> 06:55.475
.. stuffed into his sack

06:55.575 --> 06:58.539
and put down into the flames of hell.

06:58.908 --> 07:01.621
Typical Friday night
in Berkhamsted, hey, Mummy?

07:01.721 --> 07:05.538
Oh! His eyes,
something about his eyes,

07:06.163 --> 07:08.096
like he knows something.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.408
Everything.

07:14.615 --> 07:18.541
Well, I think we'll stick with good old Father
Christmas if it's all the same with you, Klaus.

07:18.641 --> 07:20.920
Now, come on, everybody,
let's go and unpack.

07:24.730 --> 07:26.170
Come on, darling.

07:32.723 --> 07:37.024
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

07:37.124 --> 07:41.102
If I shall die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.671
Amen.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.717
Good boy, Toby.

07:45.148 --> 07:47.682
Sleep well.
- I'm not tired.

07:47.782 --> 07:51.911
Try and rest. You need your energy
for all that skiing tomorrow.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.909
Toby, what's this?

07:58.034 --> 07:59.601
What?
- Your boots.

07:59.723 --> 08:01.377
What are they doing out there?

08:01.477 --> 08:03.643
I left them out for Krampus.

08:03.804 --> 08:04.830
What?

08:04.930 --> 08:08.495
Klaus said if you have been a
good boy Saint Nicholas will come

08:08.595 --> 08:12.267
and leave coins and sweets in your
shoes, or presents in your sack...

08:12.367 --> 08:14.286
'Not the best actor in the world,

08:14.386 --> 08:16.530
'but very hard to find a good child

08:16.630 --> 08:19.098
'given the subject matter of the film.'

08:19.954 --> 08:22.680
.. Darling, Krampus isn't real.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.557
It's just a story.

08:24.792 --> 08:26.152
And Santa?

08:27.116 --> 08:28.672
Go to sleep.

08:40.763 --> 08:43.326
Oh!
- Everything all right, darling?

08:43.426 --> 08:45.172
You look like you've seen a ghost.

08:45.272 --> 08:48.834
Oh, it's nothing,
all these myths and legends,

08:49.014 --> 08:52.097
I don't like that man coming in here
scaring Toby like that.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.393
I'd say it's not Toby who's scared.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.251
You're shaking like a leaf.

08:56.351 --> 08:59.083
Come to bed.
- All right, I will.

09:30.723 --> 09:32.686
Well, don't look at me, I
didn't put it there.

09:32.786 --> 09:34.264
Well, somebody did.

09:34.643 --> 09:37.151
Poor Toby hasn't stopped crying
all morning.

09:37.348 --> 09:40.949
Where is he now?
- Klaus took Cathy and he to the village

09:41.049 --> 09:42.457
to get a cup of hot chocolate.

09:42.557 --> 09:44.227
Oh, well, that ought to cheer
him up.

09:44.327 --> 09:46.563
Just a bunch of old twigs, anyhow.

09:46.877 --> 09:51.353
Maybe it was one of the locals trying to scare
the gullible tourists and keep us entertained.

09:51.592 --> 09:55.855
Yes, maybe, or perhaps...

09:56.304 --> 09:57.801
Perhaps what?

09:57.901 --> 09:59.952
Oh, nothing.
- No, go on, spit it out.

10:01.523 --> 10:04.152
Perhaps Cathy put them there
herself.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.262
Why on earth would she do that?

10:06.683 --> 10:08.724
Oh, Julian, you know what I think.

10:09.003 --> 10:13.266
Toby reminds Cathy of your first
wife and she resents him for it.

10:13.366 --> 10:14.510
Don't be ridiculous.

10:14.610 --> 10:15.984
It's true.

10:16.683 --> 10:20.465
It wouldn't surprise me if Cathy hadn't
put those sticks there herself...

10:20.980 --> 10:23.325
'Nancy overshot her mark again.

10:23.492 --> 10:26.938
'She wouldn't wear glasses, said
they were wrong for the character.

10:27.092 --> 10:30.125
'But Brian saved the day, look.

10:30.365 --> 10:31.615
'Oh, yeah.'

10:31.796 --> 10:36.256
I don't trust her.
Disappearing for days on end.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.686
And if she doesn't want to fulfil
her wifely duties, well, then,

10:41.523 --> 10:43.409
maybe you should move on.

10:44.104 --> 10:46.682
I've no intention of divorcing
Cathy, Mummy.

10:46.818 --> 10:49.893
I love her and she loves me.
And if you don't like that

10:50.143 --> 10:52.783
you can get the next plane home
to Berkhamsted.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.260
Fine.
But you know what Klaus said.

10:59.260 --> 11:01.957
Those sticks are a warning.

11:02.057 --> 11:05.295
Rubbish.
And you know what we do with rubbish.

11:16.502 --> 11:19.582
Ralph, can we just see
the plate in for a moment?

11:21.429 --> 11:22.989
'That's great, thank you.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.046
'OK, quiet on the floor, please,

11:26.146 --> 11:28.037
'there was a lot of noise on that
last take.

11:28.137 --> 11:31.381
'Here we go.
'In five, four, three...'

11:36.923 --> 11:39.366
And then Klaus showed us how they
train the reindeer,

11:39.466 --> 11:42.226
and then we went on a husky ride
through the snow.

11:42.523 --> 11:45.222
You certainly seem to have had
a busy day.

11:45.563 --> 11:47.740
Can I have a husky, Father?

11:47.950 --> 11:49.132
I don't think so.

11:49.232 --> 11:53.053
Please.
- Don't pester your father, Toby.

11:53.153 --> 11:56.137
Off you go to bed, now,
I'll be up in a moment.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.643
Goodnight.

12:00.883 --> 12:03.085
Thank you, Klaus.
I had a lovely day.

12:03.185 --> 12:06.233
Oh, you are welcome, master Toby,
schlaf gut.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.935
Don't forget your sack.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.958
Today is the 6th of December,

12:13.184 --> 12:15.557
the feast of Saint Nicholas.

12:16.178 --> 12:18.978
'Actors hate doing eating scenes.

12:19.643 --> 12:21.123
'Why's that?

12:21.403 --> 12:25.309
'They've got to remember their
continuity, the food is cold,

12:25.763 --> 12:29.491
'so you'll notice here,
nobody eats a thing.'

12:31.980 --> 12:34.576
Not according to the Krampus.

12:34.803 --> 12:36.749
Mummy, don't start on about
that again.

12:36.849 --> 12:39.288
No, no, it's fine,
I've worked out what happened.

12:39.388 --> 12:41.797
Oh, pray tell.

12:42.606 --> 12:45.802
Darling, do you remember that
time just after we'd moved into

12:45.902 --> 12:49.519
the new house, you heard a noise
downstairs and found Toby

12:49.619 --> 12:51.839
in front of an open fridge
drinking milk from the bottle

12:51.939 --> 12:53.701
and eating an onion as if it were
an apple?

12:53.801 --> 12:55.901
Yes, but that was just sleepwalking,

12:56.001 --> 12:58.567
the doctor said he was unsettled
because of the move.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.606
Exactly.
And that's just what happened last night.

13:01.918 --> 13:04.316
Klaus put those silly stories into
his head...

13:04.684 --> 13:08.374
Sorry, Klaus, and, and he put
the switch there himself

13:08.474 --> 13:10.069
into his own boot.

13:11.301 --> 13:12.972
Sleepwalking?

13:13.318 --> 13:16.965
What a terribly convenient explanation.

13:17.519 --> 13:19.551
It is what happened,
I'm sure of it!

13:19.651 --> 13:21.841
All right, darling,
don't upset yourself.

13:21.941 --> 13:25.163
Remember what the doctor said,
we must have peace and calm.

13:25.483 --> 13:28.757
But Toby was happy today, like he
didn't have a care in the world.

13:28.857 --> 13:30.380
That's right, isn't it, Klaus?

13:30.723 --> 13:32.730
Master Toby is a good boy.

13:33.022 --> 13:35.167
The Krampus will not return.

13:35.298 --> 13:36.595
Hear hear.

13:36.830 --> 13:40.110
This food is delicious, by
the way, any chance of seconds?

13:51.032 --> 13:53.204
'And cut. Thank you.'

15:06.583 --> 15:07.783
Toby,

15:08.137 --> 15:09.795
where have you been?

15:10.003 --> 15:11.636
You scared Granny.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.814
I couldn't sleep, I heard a noise.

15:13.963 --> 15:15.710
Get back into bed at once.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.977
I've been a good boy, Granny,
I know I have,

15:18.077 --> 15:20.912
Saint Nicholas has left me some presents.
- Oh!

15:21.516 --> 15:23.036
Get back into bed at once.

15:23.903 --> 15:25.463
'Mini fluff there.'

15:27.123 --> 15:28.401
There.

15:28.683 --> 15:31.440
Creeping around like that in
the middle of the night.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.367
Sorry, Granny.

15:35.483 --> 15:37.037
Night-night.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.684
What is it?
What's wrong?

16:24.610 --> 16:25.810
Look.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.580
My God.
Toby, what happened?

16:29.963 --> 16:31.914
I don't know.

16:32.494 --> 16:35.747
I woke up this morning
and they were there.

16:36.318 --> 16:37.950
I thought I'd been good.

16:38.608 --> 16:42.565
We can't put this down to sleepwalking.
- No, it's Krampus.

16:42.665 --> 16:44.946
It's the second night and he's left
his mark,

16:45.046 --> 16:47.585
exactly as Klaus said he would,
just as in the legend.

16:47.685 --> 16:49.735
Cathy, calm down,
you mustn't excite yourself.

16:49.835 --> 16:51.200
But it's all coming true,

16:51.300 --> 16:54.547
and if what Klaus says is right then
tomorrow night he'll take Toby away.

16:54.803 --> 16:56.338
Oh, please, don't let him.

16:56.438 --> 16:58.193
All right, that's enough!

16:58.867 --> 17:01.077
Can't you see you're scaring the boy?

17:01.633 --> 17:05.338
Toby, get dressed.
We're leaving.

17:07.123 --> 17:09.766
Brian, Dennis is asking for the last line again,

17:09.866 --> 17:11.242
but even angrier, please.

17:11.422 --> 17:12.662
OK.

17:14.443 --> 17:16.332
Can't you see you're
scaring the boy?

17:16.945 --> 17:20.387
Toby, get dressed.
We're leaving.

17:22.282 --> 17:24.323
'Great, we bought that.
Thank you.'

17:28.883 --> 17:30.440
Only two seats left?

17:30.643 --> 17:32.625
All right, let me call you back.

17:34.102 --> 17:36.542
Well, looks like we're not
going anywhere.

17:37.004 --> 17:38.632
But we've got to DO something.

17:38.732 --> 17:41.080
Toby's in danger.
- There's nothing we can do.

17:41.180 --> 17:42.651
I'll take him.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.426
I've already packed my suitcase.

17:45.923 --> 17:48.852
I think it might be for the best to
get Toby away from...

17:49.043 --> 17:51.220
What?
Say it.

17:51.710 --> 17:54.062
From me, you think I did this,
don't you?

17:54.162 --> 17:55.581
She didn't say that, Cathy.

17:55.681 --> 17:57.326
No, but she thinks it.

17:57.426 --> 17:59.899
You've been under a lot of strain
recently.

18:00.123 --> 18:01.975
So have you, Julian.

18:02.403 --> 18:05.297
Remember, this holiday was not just
about Cathy.

18:05.963 --> 18:08.741
Could it be possible that you
accidentally made those marks on

18:08.841 --> 18:11.745
the boy when you were getting him
dressed, not deliberately, but...

18:11.845 --> 18:14.682
Why would I?
Why would I hurt my own son?

18:14.782 --> 18:16.639
He is not YOUR son.

18:18.643 --> 18:20.344
Book those tickets, Julian.

18:21.163 --> 18:23.679
I shall see you both in a week's time.

18:27.643 --> 18:29.683
'And she ran out of stairs.'

18:33.061 --> 18:35.216
'And this always annoys me,

18:35.316 --> 18:38.127
'empty suitcases, light as a feather.'

18:39.443 --> 18:41.454
I have brought up children of
my own, you know?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.636
All right, Mummy, don't start.

18:43.779 --> 18:45.384
'Why are they all in a line?

18:45.484 --> 18:47.129
'Oh, you noticed that, did you?

18:47.229 --> 18:49.569
'Well, it's a casualty of having no time.

18:49.850 --> 18:51.922
'I had to get it all in one shot.

18:52.345 --> 18:54.307
'I don't think it looks too bad.

18:54.603 --> 18:57.027
'I was happy with that snow.'

19:01.290 --> 19:02.587
'And it's cold...'

19:06.110 --> 19:09.282
'And here we are, coming into
the denouement.

19:09.985 --> 19:12.744
'I knew we were losing Brian
at six o'clock.

19:12.844 --> 19:14.837
'He had a voice-over for Findus,
or something

19:14.937 --> 19:16.787
'so he was keen to get away early.

19:17.234 --> 19:20.668
'Yeah, you can practically see
the pound signs in his eyes.

19:21.141 --> 19:23.594
'He was definitely rushing
through the scene.'

19:24.484 --> 19:26.367
.. Besides, Toby likes a bit of
turbulence,

19:26.467 --> 19:28.749
he says it is like being on a ride
at the fairground.

19:28.859 --> 19:30.829
Yes, but what if...
- Yes, what is it, darling?

19:30.929 --> 19:32.374
Say what's on your mind.

19:32.992 --> 19:35.627
Well, I was just thinking...

19:36.988 --> 19:39.431
'Penny was being deliberately
slow here,

19:39.531 --> 19:41.774
'I think she was on to him about
the advert.'

19:42.249 --> 19:46.049
We've sent Toby and your mother
away with that man, Klaus,

19:47.008 --> 19:49.236
and we don't know the first thing
about him.

19:49.336 --> 19:51.768
Of course we do, he's the caretaker,
he runs this place,

19:51.868 --> 19:53.331
how else would he have the keys?

19:53.431 --> 19:55.540
He could've...I don't know,

19:56.149 --> 19:58.096
rented the place from
the real owners

19:58.196 --> 19:59.635
and pretended to be the caretaker.

19:59.735 --> 20:01.928
Why on earth would he do that?
It makes no sense.

20:02.058 --> 20:03.774
Now, come on, it's been a long day,

20:03.874 --> 20:05.890
get into bed and I'll turn out the light.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.199
Brush my hair for me, Julian.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.527
You know I've never liked thunder.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.516
Of course.

20:19.779 --> 20:21.628
I'm being silly, I know.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.077
Toby and your mother will be fine,
won't they?

20:24.177 --> 20:26.925
I just got carried away by that
silly Krampus story.

20:27.098 --> 20:29.812
That's right, darling,
I told you before,

20:30.138 --> 20:32.629
there's absolutely no such thing
as...

20:34.948 --> 20:36.390
Julian, what is it?

20:37.917 --> 20:39.117
Nothing.

20:39.584 --> 20:41.624
There is something, I can tell.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.551
Your back, it's covered in scratches.

20:50.218 --> 20:51.741
It's the Krampus.

20:52.303 --> 20:53.988
He's coming for me?

20:54.258 --> 20:55.738
But that's impossible.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.113
My shoes.
The wardrobe.

21:04.107 --> 21:06.693
No!
- It's true, I told you!

21:06.793 --> 21:10.531
But it makes no sense, the Krampus only
comes for children, the legend says so.

21:10.631 --> 21:13.340
Julian... I'm pregnant.

21:17.504 --> 21:18.723
Wait there.

21:42.617 --> 21:45.779
It was just a branch.
The storm must have blown it in.

21:46.908 --> 21:50.568
You get back to bed,
I'm going to lock all the doors.

21:51.498 --> 21:54.107
Real or not, Krampus isn't getting
in here tonight.

22:14.298 --> 22:15.578
Cathy.

22:29.191 --> 22:30.486
Darling?

22:30.938 --> 22:32.328
Everything all right?

22:34.426 --> 22:36.760
Come back to bed, you'll catch your death.

22:37.418 --> 22:39.387
There's that expression again.

22:40.002 --> 22:41.602
Catch your death.

22:42.698 --> 22:44.400
Is something wrong?
- Yes,

22:45.135 --> 22:46.844
I understand now,

22:47.578 --> 22:50.244
you said the Krampus only comes
for children,

22:51.182 --> 22:52.776
and I'm pregnant.

22:53.178 --> 22:54.378
Yes?

22:55.951 --> 22:57.631
But that's not all, is it?

22:58.225 --> 23:00.476
He only comes for the bad children.

23:01.258 --> 23:03.049
What are you getting at?

23:03.889 --> 23:06.081
There's something I haven't
told you.

23:06.941 --> 23:08.882
Something about this child.

23:13.858 --> 23:15.058
Hello.

23:15.618 --> 23:17.936
Oh, Mummy, you got home safe.

23:18.043 --> 23:19.860
Toby all right?
Good.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.514
Thanks for letting me know.

23:21.614 --> 23:24.566
Yes, yes, we're fine.
Goodnight, Mummy.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.580
Well?

23:32.808 --> 23:34.008
You were saying.

23:35.328 --> 23:37.128
I've been bad, Julian.

23:38.924 --> 23:42.244
This baby, it isn't yours!

23:42.979 --> 23:44.278
What?

23:46.704 --> 23:48.784
Cathy, behind you!

23:55.842 --> 23:57.425
You let go of her, you fiend!

23:58.127 --> 23:59.464
Julian, no!

24:15.567 --> 24:18.519
Pills, my pills!

24:19.548 --> 24:22.734
What, these pills?

24:23.978 --> 24:25.467
I threw them away.

24:26.258 --> 24:27.557
I'm sorry.

24:29.069 --> 24:30.508
Goodbye, darling.

24:38.011 --> 24:39.975
Don't worry, Julian.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.684
I'll look after her now.

24:45.538 --> 24:46.847
Merry Christmas.

24:53.135 --> 24:54.926
'And there's your ending.

24:55.117 --> 24:57.375
'Well, not quite.'

24:57.475 --> 24:59.969
Right, we've got ten minutes
to get the final scene.

25:00.069 --> 25:01.669
Cameras, round to the bedroom,
please.

25:01.769 --> 25:03.651
Dennis is coming down to the floor.

25:04.138 --> 25:06.675
'What does that mean,
coming down to the floor?

25:06.778 --> 25:10.559
'The studio floor.
I needed to be there for the climax.'

25:11.259 --> 25:12.876
Bye, everyone.
- Bye, Brian. Bye.

25:12.976 --> 25:15.017
Good luck with the voice-over.
- OK.

25:15.475 --> 25:16.718
'Such a rush now.

25:16.818 --> 25:19.914
'Always the same with filming,
it's Gandhi in the morning,

25:20.035 --> 25:22.546
'Hollyoaks in the afternoon.'

25:24.753 --> 25:26.372
Thanks, Penny, here we go, then.

25:26.472 --> 25:28.763
In five, four, three...

25:35.538 --> 25:37.831
I've poured you a glass of champagne.

25:38.213 --> 25:42.056
I know I shouldn't drink, what with
me being pregnant with your baby,

25:42.578 --> 25:44.943
but one little glass won't harm,
will it?

25:45.218 --> 25:48.085
Besides, you deserve a treat,

25:48.272 --> 25:50.931
spending all that time in character.

25:51.592 --> 25:55.407
Fancy having to spend a whole day
with that little brat, Toby,

25:55.507 --> 25:57.249
I don't know how you bore it.

25:58.138 --> 26:01.020
Oh, I thought you were going to have
a shower.

26:01.499 --> 26:03.631
Couldn't keep your hands off me, eh?

26:03.938 --> 26:06.768
What's this? Kinky.

26:07.218 --> 26:09.529
I wondered what those chains were for.

26:11.498 --> 26:13.369
I'll call the police in the morning.

26:13.820 --> 26:17.692
It's perfect, really, Julian has
been under a lot of stress,

26:18.018 --> 26:20.273
the doctors suggested this holiday,

26:20.723 --> 26:22.689
but his medication ran out

26:22.934 --> 26:26.578
and I found him lying dead at
the bottom of the stairs.

26:28.240 --> 26:31.320
We should have the insurance money
in time for New Year.

26:31.578 --> 26:34.337
I can't wait to see the look
on Celia's face.

26:34.698 --> 26:37.841
Oh, she'll suspect something,
but where's the proof?

26:38.538 --> 26:40.890
Like I said, it's perfect.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.688
Oh, darling, that hurts.

26:47.446 --> 26:50.498
Well, what are you waiting for?

26:51.418 --> 26:53.738
Aren't you going to ravish me,
Simon?

26:55.166 --> 26:56.366
Simon?

26:57.498 --> 26:59.858
I don't know anyone called Simon.

27:01.298 --> 27:03.695
I'm Krampus.

27:04.595 --> 27:06.360
No.

27:06.460 --> 27:07.636
No!

27:13.898 --> 27:17.537
And cut! Great, thanks, Ralph,
if we could just step you off.

27:17.698 --> 27:20.652
Cheers, Dennis.
- Oh, are you done, Ralph?

27:21.818 --> 27:23.965
I'll see you at the screening if
there is one, shall I?

27:24.065 --> 27:26.903
All right, keep rolling,
we're setting up for scene 18B.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.419
Oh, is it a new scene?
- Dennis...

27:30.618 --> 27:32.378
Quick as you can, please.

27:33.552 --> 27:36.752
I-I didn't get pink pages for this
if there were some, Dennis.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.978
Just changing camera position.

27:39.078 --> 27:41.700
Dennis, can someone please tell me
what's happening?

27:42.180 --> 27:43.390
Oh.

27:43.968 --> 27:46.489
Dennis, tell me what's happening.
Ow!

27:47.734 --> 27:49.134
Dennis?

27:49.606 --> 27:53.880
'Always a strange moment when you
see them realise what's going on.

27:54.733 --> 27:59.178
'You see, there's no acting here,
that's genuine fear.

28:00.298 --> 28:02.459
'I don't think I want to watch
the ending.'

28:02.818 --> 28:04.039
Action!

28:04.139 --> 28:05.301
Dennis!

28:05.514 --> 28:07.755
No! No!

28:16.316 --> 28:17.917
'Well, that's it.

28:18.118 --> 28:21.444
'Can't believe it surfaced again
after all these years.

28:21.544 --> 28:24.560
'In its defence, it was one of
the better ones, but

28:25.763 --> 28:28.615
'if only I'd got Gummidge.
