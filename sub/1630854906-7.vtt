00:07.425 --> 00:10.678
<i>I'm counting bones
of your casualties</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:13.806
<i>You dig up demons
like a sweet addiction</i>

00:13.806 --> 00:16.434
<i>Feeding me fear
so you can take control</i>

00:16.434 --> 00:20.396
<i>You're gonna crumble,
crumble, mm-hmm</i>

00:20.396 --> 00:23.733
<i>Don't you see you're
drowning in your gold?</i>

00:23.733 --> 00:26.610
<i>Heavy ego weighing
down your throat</i>

00:26.610 --> 00:29.447
<i>And now the cracks
are creepin' up your tower</i>

00:29.447 --> 00:32.867
<i>You'll crumble, crumble,
mm-hmm</i>

00:32.867 --> 00:36.120
<i>Playin' God with
that facade</i>

00:36.120 --> 00:39.457
<i>Won't get you your Camelot</i>

00:39.457 --> 00:42.376
<i>Payback's hanging
in the air</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:45.629
<i>Payback for your
wicked lies</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:48.799
<i>Storm clouds
rollin' in up high</i>

00:48.799 --> 00:52.344
<i>Singe and scorch
the crimson sky</i>

00:52.344 --> 00:54.847
<i>Payback's hanging
in the air</i>

00:54.847 --> 00:58.601
<i>Payback for your
wicked lies</i>

01:00.352 --> 01:03.522
<i>Tick tock, tick tock</i>

01:09.487 --> 01:10.946
Excuse me. Sir?

01:10.946 --> 01:12.323
Hey!

01:12.323 --> 01:14.200
Hey, wait a minute! Can you stop?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.076
I need to talk to you!

01:17.703 --> 01:20.122
So, how'd we look? Pass inspection?

01:20.122 --> 01:21.582
Flying colors. No infractions.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.167
All right. So we're good to go?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.127
I gotta start loading if we're
gonna make our departure.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.004
Gotta lotta chop out there today.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.964
Always feel bad for the schmuck
who's gotta clean the head

01:28.964 --> 01:30.633
after a bumpy ride.

01:30.633 --> 01:33.260
You go ahead and get
those people on board.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.554
Wouldn't want anyone to miss the ferry.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.150
I brought some treats for Agnes.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.444
You'll never guess where I got them.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.488
The New Jersey Turnpike.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.407
A diabolically inhumane

01:55.407 --> 01:58.118
and utterly demoralizing length of road

01:58.118 --> 02:00.621
that surprisingly strings together

02:00.621 --> 02:04.792
an intriguing collection
of, eh, travel plazas.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.502
Rest stops.

02:06.502 --> 02:10.256
Each of which is named
after a historical dead person

02:10.256 --> 02:12.842
somehow associated with Jersey,

02:12.842 --> 02:14.510
from Walt Whitman,

02:14.510 --> 02:17.847
who frankly, I would associate
more with New York--

02:17.847 --> 02:20.307
To Vince Lombardi,
who I believe everyone

02:20.307 --> 02:23.102
would associate
with Green Bay, Wisconsin.

02:23.102 --> 02:26.063
They have gummy snakes
three feet long.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.898
You drove yourself
from New York this morning

02:27.898 --> 02:29.900
to tour the New Jersey rest stops?

02:29.900 --> 02:31.318
Last night, but yes.

02:32.278 --> 02:34.655
It was a welcome addition
to the itinerary.

02:34.655 --> 02:38.284
I had an early meeting about
a construction project.

02:39.118 --> 02:42.371
But I'm finding I prefer
being under my own steam.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.832
On the way back,
I'm stopping for a ride

02:44.832 --> 02:48.002
on the tallest roller coaster
in North America.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.045
I'm scared to death.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.757
I was sorry to hear about Robert Vesco.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.634
I know you two were close.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.011
Too close, I'm afraid.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.181
Robert was fond of saying

03:01.181 --> 03:04.435
that he taught me everything I know.

03:07.062 --> 03:13.027
But he didn't ever really know
the half of who or what I am.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.947
It was a terrible mistake

03:16.947 --> 03:19.783
bringing him deeper into my world.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.996
And, tragically, he was the one
to pay the price for it.

03:24.747 --> 03:26.540
He did save Dembe's life.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.083
Yes, he did do that.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.087
And that's a fine legacy.

03:35.549 --> 03:39.011
But I'll miss him,
and it's entirely my fault.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.143
Usually is.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.231
How is Dembe feeling?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.609
He's back to work.
I told him he could take more time.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.486
But the FBI doctors cleared him,

03:55.486 --> 03:57.071
and he said he'd rather work
than not.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.074
Excuse me.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.325
Good morning.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.038
Turn on the local news, Harold.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.168
But why am I only hearing
about this now?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.171
<i>As details continue to emerge.</i>
- I see.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.924
I'll follow up with you about this later.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.509
My God. What happened?

04:18.509 --> 04:19.969
Alban Veseli happened.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.554
The Freelancer?
You think he's responsible for this?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.474
After Wujing broke Veseli
out of custody,

04:25.474 --> 04:29.645
I told my associate
to put his invisible army

04:29.645 --> 04:32.231
of service industry troops
on alert.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.818
A deckhand working on
a tender ship by the piers

04:35.985 --> 04:39.029
reported seeing a man
matching Veseli's description

04:39.029 --> 04:40.656
near the ferry termina,

04:41.407 --> 04:42.700
hours ago.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.537
I'm only sorry
the tip didn't come in sooner.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.206
Here's someone
who needs no introduction--

04:49.206 --> 04:51.792
The Freelancer, AKA Alban Veseli.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.836
We've seen how Veseli hides
the identity

04:53.836 --> 04:55.379
of assassination targets

04:55.379 --> 04:57.423
by taking them out
in large-scale disasters.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.508
Sacrificing dozens
or even hundreds of lives

04:59.508 --> 05:01.260
to kill a single individual.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.680
NTSB is reporting 35 passengers
and 7 crew members dead

05:04.680 --> 05:06.056
in Baltimore Harbor this morning.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.350
We've already taken this guy out, twice.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.102
What's it gonna take for us
to keep him down?

05:10.102 --> 05:11.770
Reddington believes this event is tied

05:11.770 --> 05:13.272
directly to Wujing's plan

05:13.272 --> 05:15.482
to expose the task force's
connection to him.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.818
That would explain why Wujing
went to extreme lengths

05:17.818 --> 05:19.903
to break Veseli out of custody.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.239
Who was The Freelancer
targeting by sinking that ferry?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.867
And how does the death
of that target help Wujing?

05:24.867 --> 05:26.452
What's his end game here?

05:26.452 --> 05:27.745
These are questions we need to answer.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.329
Do we have any leads on the target?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.749
I sent you all copies
of the passenger manifest

05:31.749 --> 05:35.502
and pulled a few notable victims
that have been identified already.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.756
David Broderick,
South Baltimore city council.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.341
Sarah Miller, on parole
for counterfeiting.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.428
And Wade Han,
over a dozen arrests

05:44.428 --> 05:46.305
for weapons trafficking and assault.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.766
Do any of these people have
a connection to Reddington?

05:48.766 --> 05:51.060
I don't recognize any of them.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.228
Or anyone else on the passenger manifest.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.939
Agent Malik, keep digging
into possible targets.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.691
Ressler, Dembe, head to the docks.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.777
Look for anything
that might help us find Veseli.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.237
I'll notify the NTSB
that you're on your way.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.747
Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.373
Hey, how you doing? FBI.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.625
Thank you.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.004
Are you okay, ma'am?

06:19.004 --> 06:20.380
Did you know someone on board?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.257
Uh, Joanie Wilson, my daughter.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.260
She commutes on the ferry.
She's not answering her phone.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.221
There's a Red Cross volunteer inside.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.723
They're handling all inquiries
for concerned family members.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.058
Oh, thank you.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.520
Show some courtesy and respect.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.396
There are people here in pain.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.315
Sorry, man. My bad.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.401
It's too early
to determine exact cause.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.279
But before the ferry went down,
the captain reported a loud noise

06:44.279 --> 06:45.739
from a rupture in the engine room.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.658
It may have jeopardized
the integrity of the hull.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.743
What's the likelihood
of something like that ever happening?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.955
I don't know.
We'll know more after the investigation.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.414
There is something weird, though.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.666
I'm all ears.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.084
According to the terminal manager,

06:57.084 --> 06:58.961
the ship received
a clean safety inspection

06:58.961 --> 07:00.838
from a marine inspector
for the Coast Guard.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.048
Would that inspector
have access to the engine room?

07:03.048 --> 07:04.508
Yeah, sure.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.176
The engine room's one of
the primary areas of focus

07:06.176 --> 07:07.970
when it comes to safety.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.638
Nobody else by the waterline,
got it?

07:09.638 --> 07:10.889
Keep the dock clear.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.641
We still have bodies in the water.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.856
Excuse me, sir.
Can we speak with you?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.107
We're with the FBI.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.358
Of course, whatever you need.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.776
NTSB said you're the one who dealt

07:22.776 --> 07:24.528
with the Coast Guard inspector
this morning.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.780
Was there an inspection
scheduled for today?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.699
Well, no. But that's not unusual.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.826
Coast Guard inspections
are usually a surprise.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.369
Did anyone accompany the inspector

07:32.369 --> 07:34.079
- while he was on the ferry?
- There's no need.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.455
They know their way
around the vessels.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.291
So he was alone in the engine room.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.459
I guess. Unless there were
crew members present.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.711
Why? What are you thinking?

07:40.711 --> 07:42.421
Was this the guy you met with?

07:42.421 --> 07:44.006
Yeah, that's him.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.674
Where exactly did you
speak with him? On board?

07:45.674 --> 07:46.967
No. Right on the dock.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.469
He was throwing away his gloves.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.096
Thank you.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.600
Hey.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.316
Oof!

08:02.316 --> 08:04.067
Some kind of chemical on this.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.777
We gotta get this analyzed. Fast.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.613
Our forensics team
is already overloaded

08:07.613 --> 08:10.324
with all the evidence coming in
from the ferry and the victims.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.950
You know who we could call?

08:11.950 --> 08:14.036
What about Reddington's pal?
What was his name? Harry?

08:14.036 --> 08:15.704
Herbie. He came through in the past.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.331
And he was quick.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.208
As long as there's no foosball tournament.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.459
- Foosball?
- I'll tell you about it later.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.044
Let me get in touch with Cooper,

08:22.044 --> 08:23.587
see if he can't approve
Herbie coming in today.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.881
We gotta get this analyzed immediately.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.636
<i>...marine tragedy.</i>

08:30.636 --> 08:33.639
<i>43 passengers and crew
have been confirmed dead at this time,</i>

08:33.639 --> 08:36.433
<i>with several still unaccounted for.</i>

08:36.433 --> 08:38.101
Wujing is very pleased.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.230
Well, he's gonna love
what I have planned next.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.373
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>

09:00.832 --> 09:02.918
- Papi, get the door.
- Ay.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.133
- Raymond!
- Hello, Rogelio.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.804
Oh, I'm interrupting, <i>lo siento.</i>

09:13.804 --> 09:17.599
No, no, no, of course not.
It's an honor to have you.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.644
You've got quite the operation
going here.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.189
After so many years of washing sheets,
I saw some room for improvement.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.857
Oh, feel this.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.568
Soft as a lamb, durable too,
like nothing else on the market.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.487
Oh, my. That is nice.

09:30.487 --> 09:34.283
You must be putting in
a tremendous amount of time

09:34.283 --> 09:36.326
and effort into this project.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.703
Mm-hmm.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.496
That explains it.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.422
Explains what?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.424
I needed you to reach out to me

09:50.424 --> 09:53.218
the moment Alban Veseli was spotted.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.886
But I didn't hear from you

09:54.886 --> 09:57.806
until after a dozen bodies
had washed ashore,

09:57.806 --> 10:00.726
because your head is filled
with Egyptian cotton.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.394
Raymond, I called you
the second that tip came in.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.397
Rogelio, I need the full attention of you

10:05.397 --> 10:09.693
and every maid, bellhop,
and busboy on your payroll.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.321
I'll triple the reward.
I'll-- I'll stay up all night

10:12.321 --> 10:13.780
and make sure everyone's on alert.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.073
Well, about that.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.784
I actually have a second request.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.704
I need to stay in town
until I sort this out.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.874
That wouldn't be a pull-out, would it?

10:23.874 --> 10:28.754
As a possible investor,
I'd love a chance to test these sheets.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.886
I am very proud to say
that one of us is celebrating

10:35.886 --> 10:37.971
a year sober today.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.267
Donald, why don't you come up here?

10:47.981 --> 10:49.733
Congratulations.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.818
- Thank you.
- Want to say something?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.820
Go ahead.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.450
Thank you.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.869
I mean, I really wouldn't
be here without

11:00.869 --> 11:02.371
everyone in this room.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.917
I used to think that
going it alone made me stronger.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.628
But that's not true.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.881
No, not in here, not out there.

11:14.716 --> 11:19.221
No, real strength comes
from accepting that you're...

11:22.224 --> 11:23.934
...accepting that you're weak

11:25.769 --> 11:28.313
and that it's okay to ask for help.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.281
Powerful words, Donald.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.077
Please don't ever make me do that again.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.204
You know, there's a lot
of people that need help.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.250
You ever, uh, you ever thought
about becoming a sponsor?

11:48.250 --> 11:49.334
Sponsor?

11:49.918 --> 11:52.045
No. No, that's a big step.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.381
So is a year sober.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.758
I think you're ready.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.970
You, uh, you see that guy
over there?

12:00.554 --> 12:02.764
You're in similar lines of work.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.474
You know better than anyone
how hard it is

12:04.474 --> 12:06.059
to stay clean in this town

12:06.643 --> 12:09.688
in a high-stress job,
where everything's a secret.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.356
I don't talk about my work here.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.732
I know, but...

12:13.525 --> 12:16.695
I've been leading meetings
in D.C. for a long time.

12:16.695 --> 12:19.823
There's a... look.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.700
You have it, so does he.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.578
I think you could help each other.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.957
- Can I think about it?
- Of course, take your time.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.542
We'll talk about it
next meeting, all right?

12:39.301 --> 12:41.094
Where are we right now?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.597
Those were some crazy cool
security protocols.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.474
I gotta be honest, when I saw
those blackout goggles,

12:45.474 --> 12:46.683
I was like, "Whoa!"

12:46.683 --> 12:48.185
I mean, this is like the modern-day

12:48.185 --> 12:50.645
bag over the head
like in the movies, right?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.939
Except I get to go home and kiss Holly,

12:52.939 --> 12:54.941
make faces at Sue... right?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.818
I get to go home, right?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.195
You do.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.740
Whoa!

13:01.740 --> 13:03.116
Whoa, this is...

13:03.909 --> 13:05.285
What is this?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.120
Hey, Herbie. Thanks for helping us out.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.914
I know you. We spoke on the phone.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.165
Donald, right?

13:10.165 --> 13:11.791
Agent Ressler.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.710
And-- And my man Dembe.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.004
You're part of all this?
That is so cool.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.631
How's it feel to be
on the straight and narrow?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.299
It doesn't feel straight or narrow.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.176
Herbie, why don't I show you the lab?

13:21.176 --> 13:23.261
We need to find out how
that ferry was sabotaged.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.804
Yeah, my Laminar Hood at home

13:24.804 --> 13:26.139
is just not big enough for the job.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.390
You know how it is.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.767
Did Red set this up?

13:28.767 --> 13:31.311
The fewer questions,
the better, Mr. Hambright.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.063
Wait a minute.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.189
Is this a black site?

13:35.023 --> 13:36.399
I figured it out, right?

13:36.399 --> 13:38.068
Which means that you guys are,

13:38.068 --> 13:39.444
dramatic pause...

13:39.444 --> 13:40.695
CIA.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.155
- No.
- Oh, okay.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.281
NSA.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.742
Come on, Herbie.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.327
Red's really anxious for those results.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.954
NGA? NRO?

13:48.954 --> 13:50.830
I know this can't be NCIS.
I've watched that for years.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.290
It's nothing like this.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.708
- Here?
- Yeah. Right here.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.421
Bathroom's free.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.466
I see you found my robe.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.343
Oh, yes. I'm so sorry.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.636
I hope you don't mind.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.680
It was either this
or young Teo's,

14:06.680 --> 14:08.557
which nobody wants
to see me in.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.141
But I'm terribly sorry.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.601
I'll replace it immediately.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.687
Don't be silly. It looks very nice.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.146
Just make yourself at home.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.481
I need to help Ita.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.275
She got up early
to make you arepas.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.859
Aww!

14:19.859 --> 14:21.611
<i>Gracias.</i>

14:23.488 --> 14:25.156
I think she has a crush on you.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.492
Not half as much
as I have on her.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.036
You two keep spoiling me,
I'll have to extend my visit.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.164
Careful, day two is when
Abuelita really makes her move.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.667
Ha! I can't wait.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.295
All right, so I ran a whole
bunch of tests on your glove.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.463
The noxious fumes
come from a bacteria--

14:40.463 --> 14:42.424
Leptospirillum ferricomedentis.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.009
Is it dangerous?

14:44.009 --> 14:45.969
I put my nose
pretty close to that thing.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.054
No, as long as it didn't touch
your skin, you're okay.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.639
It's not an infectious agent.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.309
<i>Ferrum,</i> "iron." <i>Comedentis,</i> "devouring."

14:52.309 --> 14:53.768
"Iron devouring."

14:53.768 --> 14:55.520
And if anything,
the name undersells it.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.814
One swab could eat through
a nail in under an hour.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.482
Normally, it's used
for industrial cleanup,

14:59.482 --> 15:01.151
but it could also weaken

15:01.151 --> 15:02.819
the tensile strength of a ship's hull.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.237
If one were so inclined.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.114
So The Freelancer rigged
the engine to blow,

15:06.114 --> 15:07.907
but he wanted to make sure it
would punch a hole in the ship.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.492
How would he get this bacteria?

15:09.492 --> 15:11.328
It's heavily regulated and super rare.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.747
But I tracked down the lab
that bio-engineers it.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.166
I called the lab, and last week
they sold a vial

15:16.166 --> 15:18.752
to the Appalachian Defense Alliance,

15:18.752 --> 15:20.837
supposedly for cleaning up
mining waste.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.505
Supposedly?

15:22.505 --> 15:25.425
The Appalachian Alliance
doesn't exist except on paper.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.218
But their bank account
seemed real enough.

15:27.218 --> 15:30.639
So I made a call and requisitioned
their transaction history.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.726
Gas masks, tools,
flammable solvents,

15:34.726 --> 15:36.686
everything needed to punch
a hole in that ship.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.938
Uh, yeah, except there's
only one problem.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.607
Can you spot it?

15:40.607 --> 15:41.733
Can you?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.152
I did.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.528
The solvents. Look at the--

15:45.528 --> 15:46.988
It's the timestamps.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.823
Yeah, they were purchased
yesterday afternoon.

15:49.574 --> 15:50.950
After the ferry explosion.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.410
So The Freelancer's planning

15:52.410 --> 15:53.870
another high body count somewhere?

15:55.205 --> 15:57.207
Thank you for your help today,
Mr. Hambright.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.501
But maybe it's time
for Agent Malik to escort you back--

15:59.501 --> 16:01.086
I'm-- I'm all right. I'm good.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.338
I could stay until you,
you know, get this guy.

16:03.338 --> 16:04.673
I'm pretty invested now.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.549
And I have a sitter till 6:00, so...

16:06.549 --> 16:08.301
Oh, okay. Fine.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.178
I suppose if we're facing
an arson attack

16:10.178 --> 16:12.597
somewhere in the city,
we gotta use everything we can.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.641
Uh, but, if it's all right...
is there, like, a snack room

16:14.641 --> 16:16.059
or something
where I could get a drink?

16:16.059 --> 16:18.144
Just like a soda, some chips.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.854
I've only had applesauce today.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.147
Yes.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.565
Agent Malik can show you the way.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.359
Oh, cool, great.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.780
Mmm.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.865
Oh, no, no, no, no. <i>Gracias,</i> Abuelita.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.575
I couldn't eat another bite,

16:32.575 --> 16:36.329
even though it is the best
arepa I have ever tasted.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.997
- Ohh.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

16:39.249 --> 16:40.625
Raymond.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.085
Ah!

16:42.085 --> 16:43.878
Excuse me.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.300
There's gonna be another attack.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.594
Right here, in downtown D.C.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.138
How do you know this?

16:53.138 --> 16:55.181
I just left the housekeeper
from the Broadhurst Hotel,

16:55.181 --> 16:57.892
who saw a man who looked
exactly like Veseli go into a room.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.436
She brought him an extra
towel to be sure,

16:59.436 --> 17:00.895
and he gave her some cash.

17:00.895 --> 17:04.399
Told her to take an early lunch
and don't come back to work today.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.737
Well, we couldn't ask for
a more detailed tip than that, could we?

17:12.157 --> 17:13.825
Reddington, I'm here with the team.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.119
We've got a situation.
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

17:16.119 --> 17:18.580
<i>The Freelancer is at
the Broadhurst Hotel,</i>

17:18.580 --> 17:21.207
and he's planning
another attack imminently.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.584
What exactly, I can't say.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.960
We can.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.628
We need to call
D.C. Fire Department.

17:25.628 --> 17:28.631
Tell them we got a suspected arson,
they need to send engines immediately.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.425
I'll scramble EMS and Metro PD.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.218
Ressler, Zuma, get to that hotel.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.262
Malik, stay on the ferry manifest.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.639
And, uh... look after our guest.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.683
Oh, I just...

17:53.865 --> 17:55.450
FBI.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.869
We need to speak to
whoever's in charge here.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.746
Fire Chief set up
a command post across the street

17:59.746 --> 18:00.997
in the lobby of that building.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.248
I think he's over there right now.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.374
Thank you.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.766
Excuse me.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.351
Agents Ressler, Zuma, FBI.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.852
Oh, they were lucky.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.687
If you hadn't called when you did,

18:24.687 --> 18:26.898
we would have lost the entire
9th floor and everyone on it.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.358
But everyone's accounted for.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.609
Is that where the fire started?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.152
Apparently.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.821
The point of origin
was a housekeeping closet.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.197
Something flammable in there,

18:34.197 --> 18:35.865
probably cleaning supplies, chemicals.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.326
What about the guests who were evacuated?
Can we speak with them?

18:38.326 --> 18:40.203
I've got the guests
cordoned off in the bullpen

18:40.203 --> 18:41.454
while we take statements.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.872
Anybody you want to talk to?

18:42.872 --> 18:45.208
Let's start with everybody
on the 9th floor.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.753
Can you think of any reason

18:48.753 --> 18:50.839
someone might want
to cause you harm?

18:50.839 --> 18:52.298
Me? No.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.551
No, of course not.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.553
- Actually, uh, well...
- What?

18:56.553 --> 18:58.429
You think someone would want
to harm me?

18:58.429 --> 19:00.098
No, I think someone
might want to harm me.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.016
- I've got bookies.
- Well, you also have a wife.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.685
They don't need to know that.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.645
Well, now they do. Wait.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.190
So, are you saying that you think
someone set that fire on purpose?

19:11.359 --> 19:13.361
I don't know.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.904
What?

19:14.904 --> 19:16.823
Sorry, you don't know whether
you're in Washington

19:16.823 --> 19:18.491
for business or pleasure?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.951
Uh... Oh, no. Yeah.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.494
Yeah, business, definitely.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.039
But, uh, s-some pleasure, too.
You know?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.959
What exactly do you do for work?

19:27.959 --> 19:29.752
Oh, me? I-- I work at a bank.

19:30.545 --> 19:33.631
I know you can't speculate,
but if you suspect this was arson,

19:33.631 --> 19:35.633
you should really look
at the manager.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.219
I-- I watch a lot of
true crime documentaries.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.221
And there was this one,
where this girl went missing...

19:40.221 --> 19:43.099
The press outside... I can't...

19:43.099 --> 19:45.184
I don't want to be on--
on the news or--

19:45.184 --> 19:46.811
Or in the papers,
especially anything

19:46.811 --> 19:49.105
that might be shown in the, uh,
the-- the Richmond area.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.857
Sir, is that where your wife lives?

19:50.857 --> 19:53.151
Wife? Psst, I don't...

19:53.151 --> 19:55.570
What kind of information
do you have access to at your bank?

19:55.570 --> 19:57.280
Anything sensitive, confidential?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.115
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.284
My co-worker Emily, I was
the first person she told

20:01.284 --> 20:02.535
when she got pregnant.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.828
And I didn't tell anyone.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.413
I told my dentist, but, I mean...

20:05.413 --> 20:07.707
I think we meant anything
that might be related

20:07.707 --> 20:09.083
to illegal activity.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.002
I'm sorry, guys.

20:11.002 --> 20:14.047
My brain just really,
like, can't right now.

20:15.465 --> 20:19.135
You're really intense with
the badges and the questions.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.929
- He's high.
- As a kite.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.473
Are we almost done?

20:23.473 --> 20:25.141
I-I was supposed to be out
of here hours ago, and I just...

20:25.141 --> 20:27.018
You want to leave now?

20:27.018 --> 20:29.103
We're being interrogated by the FBI.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.064
Well, I mean, if they need
anything else,

20:31.064 --> 20:32.523
I'll give them my-- my card, okay?

20:32.523 --> 20:33.816
Just...

20:34.484 --> 20:36.069
And is-- is there another way
out of here, you know,

20:36.069 --> 20:37.737
away from the... cameras.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.448
I just...

20:40.448 --> 20:42.992
You know what?
Uh, I-I can't find my cards.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.870
Uh, it's okay. We have your names.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.538
I think we're all set.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.374
We'll reach out if there's
anything else we need.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.875
Yeah, I-I don't want my name
in the paper.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.543
Um, either of our names.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.837
Okay. Okay. Thank you, sir.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.631
Seriously?

20:59.384 --> 21:00.760
We have your payment for the tip.

21:02.512 --> 21:05.348
But we just have a few
questions to ask you first.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.141
Maria, please, have a seat.

21:14.565 --> 21:18.653
Maria, Rogelio and I
are business associates.

21:19.612 --> 21:23.491
And our business relies on information...

21:23.616 --> 21:26.244
Accurate information.

21:26.244 --> 21:30.123
Information that
people's lives depend on.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.294
So you can imagine my surprise

21:35.294 --> 21:40.508
when you turned up with
this individual's entire story

21:41.426 --> 21:45.221
wrapped up in a nice, neat bow.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.350
Please, mister, I...

21:49.350 --> 21:51.144
I-I have two babies.

21:53.021 --> 21:57.984
Maria, the man Rogelio
asked you to look for,

21:57.984 --> 22:01.112
did you find him,
or did he find you?

22:01.112 --> 22:02.405
He came to me

22:02.405 --> 22:04.240
when I arrived on the floor

22:04.240 --> 22:05.491
in the hallway.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.410
He promised me $10,000

22:07.410 --> 22:10.246
if I told Rogelio exactly what he said.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.460
Go home to your children.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.672
Maria.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.549
You're forgetting something.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.306
Raymond.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.350
You're paying her for betraying us?

22:31.350 --> 22:35.021
We offered Maria money
in exchange for information.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.899
She may have fed us
the who, what, and where

22:37.899 --> 22:39.776
on someone else's orders.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.903
But the why she just gave us?

22:43.529 --> 22:45.615
That's something to pay for.

22:45.615 --> 22:48.409
And maybe a new stroller
for good measure.

22:48.993 --> 22:52.830
You realize this all started
with that picture of us.

22:52.830 --> 22:53.998
You think?

22:54.791 --> 22:56.501
Ah, that was years ago.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.169
And nobody really saw that.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.337
I don't know.

23:00.338 --> 23:03.257
We were both there. Together.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.595
Would you give me a moment?

23:13.476 --> 23:14.936
Raymond.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.021
Have you identified a target
at the hotel?

23:17.021 --> 23:18.272
<i>Not yet.</i>

23:18.272 --> 23:19.565
How about the ferry?

23:19.565 --> 23:20.900
Nothing yet there either.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.443
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>

23:22.443 --> 23:25.154
The source who led us
to the hotel came to Rogelio

23:25.154 --> 23:27.490
on the instructions
of The Freelancer himself.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.033
The Freelancer gave the tip?

23:29.951 --> 23:32.954
Why would Veseli notify us
of his own attack?

23:32.954 --> 23:35.289
Because this was never
about the attack.

23:35.289 --> 23:36.916
It was about our response.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.961
Wujing has been looking
for proof of my relationship

23:39.961 --> 23:41.587
with the FBI.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.465
<i>If The Freelancer feeds
my network information</i>

23:44.465 --> 23:47.301
and the FBI intervenes
before they have cause,

23:47.301 --> 23:49.178
then Wujing establishes a causal link

23:49.178 --> 23:51.848
<i>between my world and yours.</i>

23:51.848 --> 23:54.267
<i>The only question is
how he intends to prove it.</i>

23:54.851 --> 23:56.811
I might have an answer to that.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.818
This footage came from
an outside CCTV camera

24:03.818 --> 24:06.028
on the same block as the hotel.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.072
Look. This one.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.033
All the other stringers
are taking photos of the action,

24:11.033 --> 24:14.787
but this guy's camera's
pointed directly at us.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.664
And look at this.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.875
He was the first photographer to arrive.

24:18.875 --> 24:21.794
Four minutes before we notified
the fire department.

24:21.794 --> 24:25.089
And this same guy was at
the site of the ferry incident.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.383
I thought he might have snapped
a photo of me,

24:27.383 --> 24:30.928
but it was so chaotic,
I couldn't be certain.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.056
Malik and Ressler are trying
to get an ID on him now.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.810
Raymond, I can't shake a feeling.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.146
We know this man from somewhere.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.023
Yeah, we do.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.194
He's the same photographer that
took that picture of us six years ago.

24:46.777 --> 24:47.862
That photo?

24:47.862 --> 24:49.822
It can't be.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.325
Remember, Rogelio was there, too?

24:52.325 --> 24:56.495
Alban Veseli is paying
Rogelio's people to pass tips to me

24:56.495 --> 24:58.789
and then sending this photographer

24:58.789 --> 25:03.586
to the incident sites
to capture your team responding.

25:03.586 --> 25:07.340
Confirmation of what Wujing
has been searching for,

25:07.340 --> 25:10.176
evidence of my relationship
with the FBI.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.220
Do you think he has
all the evidence he needs?

25:12.220 --> 25:14.722
Well, you know,
there's scarcely a rule

25:14.722 --> 25:17.308
I haven't broken in my life, Dembe.

25:17.308 --> 25:20.228
But there is one
even I won't trifle with,

25:20.228 --> 25:21.979
the Rule of Three.

25:22.396 --> 25:25.650
Goldilocks and the Three Bears,
the Three Little Pigs,

25:25.650 --> 25:28.194
the three-paragraph
persuasive essay.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.239
Three is the smallest number
of any elements

25:31.239 --> 25:35.326
that firmly establishes
a pattern in the human mind.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.079
And these photos illustrate the story

25:38.079 --> 25:40.498
Wujing is attempting to tell about me.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.918
Which means The Freelancer
is planning another attack.

25:44.293 --> 25:48.089
And Wujing's personal paparazzo
is going to lead you there.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.554
According to the local
press corps office,

25:55.554 --> 25:57.640
his name is Keith Perry.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.350
He's a local photojournalist

25:59.350 --> 26:01.811
who covers everything from inaugurations

26:01.811 --> 26:04.814
to the Maryland Little League
state championship.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.024
He'll even snap
an occasional celebrity

26:07.024 --> 26:10.569
to testify to Congress about
a pet project of the month.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.863
He snapped a photo of Raymond
several years ago

26:12.863 --> 26:14.740
that ran in a small daily rag.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.534
How come no one told us
about this before?

26:16.534 --> 26:19.870
It wasn't a big deal.
The clearest face was Rogelio's.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.998
Perry only got the back
of Raymond's head.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.417
But now, Raymond believes
The Freelancer

26:24.417 --> 26:27.878
is planning another attack
and Keith Perry will no doubt

26:27.878 --> 26:30.381
be there to capture
when we arrive on the scene.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.258
We need to find Perry. Immediately.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.760
We sent uniforms to his
apartment, but he wasn't there.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.262
He's not answering
the phone number listed

26:36.262 --> 26:37.680
with the press corps, either.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.557
Reach out to every level
of law enforcement.

26:39.557 --> 26:41.434
I want every eyeball
within a hundred square miles

26:41.434 --> 26:42.685
looking for this guy.

26:42.685 --> 26:45.563
Finding him is our best way
of preventing further loss of life.

26:45.563 --> 26:47.398
Uh, excuse me. Sorry.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.483
Uh, hey.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.694
You have something
to offer, Mr. Hambright?

26:53.487 --> 26:55.698
Oh, take your time. No rush.

26:55.990 --> 26:59.869
Look, um, I know this isn't
exactly my area of expertise.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.163
- What is it, Herbie?
- It's this.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.414
See this.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.082
Can you zoom in?

27:06.751 --> 27:08.419
That hardware is made by Novall.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.921
- Novall?
- Yeah, it's a wireless cloud adapter.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.758
It uploads every photo you take
to the cloud in real time.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.801
Super useful if you take
hundreds of pictures a day.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.470
Which I do,

27:17.470 --> 27:18.971
of Sue.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.723
Man, they say that kids
change every single day,

27:20.723 --> 27:23.309
but you don't really start noticing that
until you look at pictures.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.061
Oh! That reminds me.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.021
Would you guys mind giving
my Instagram a little follow?

27:27.021 --> 27:29.690
It's @AGirlNamedSue222.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.941
Siya?

27:30.941 --> 27:32.610
You thinking about it?

27:32.610 --> 27:34.487
Back to Novall.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.655
You think Perry
was connecting to Novall

27:36.655 --> 27:38.532
- while taking these pictures?
- Yeah.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.868
I mean, if the camera's on,
he's connect and transmitting.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.286
Instant upload, that's the plus.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.704
Malik, get a subpoena.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.748
We need access
to his photo storage, now.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.716
I noticed the chip in there.

27:55.716 --> 27:59.053
- I realized it must be, what?
- A year.

27:59.053 --> 28:00.513
Congratulations.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.681
That's a major accomplishment.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.725
That's what everyone
keeps telling me, yeah.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.018
Oh. Sick of hearing it?

28:06.894 --> 28:07.978
Once was enough.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.359
Okay, okay.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.527
Uh...

28:15.319 --> 28:17.154
NA wants me to sponsor someone.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.116
Are you gonna do it?

28:21.158 --> 28:22.743
I'm not sure.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.745
Some days, I can't even help myself.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.581
How am I supposed to help
someone else?

28:29.583 --> 28:31.794
Maybe that's the point.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.839
I've never known you not to be
of service when you can be.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.344
Subpoena came through.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.142
Novall was able to identify
the account and give us access.

28:46.684 --> 28:48.894
This is Perry's live photostream.

28:49.979 --> 28:51.772
We're in every photo.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.649
Okay, this is getting creepy.

28:53.649 --> 28:54.733
Ooh, look.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.069
He's uploading more photos--
right now, as we speak.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.487
But where is this?

28:58.487 --> 28:59.947
Looks like
an apartment building.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.198
Can we identify which one?

29:01.198 --> 29:02.867
I can't see any street signs.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.618
Are there any active emergency calls?

29:04.618 --> 29:05.953
Checking with EMS now.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.621
Nothing.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.290
Look at
the differences in the photos.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.916
He's taking test shots.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.793
He's playing around with
the F-stop and shutter speed.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.795
The Freelancer must have sent him.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.672
This may be the location
of the third attack

29:16.672 --> 29:18.132
that Raymond predicted.

29:18.132 --> 29:19.550
It fits the pattern.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.594
Malik, can we get
a more specific location?

29:21.594 --> 29:22.803
Almost.

29:22.803 --> 29:26.432
I'm zeroing in on the hotspot
he's using to transmit.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.683
Okay...

29:28.225 --> 29:29.393
Got it.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.644
Laurel Vistas.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.021
It's in Arlington.

29:32.021 --> 29:35.065
12 stories, 16 units per floor.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.235
That could mean dozens,
if not hundreds of victims.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.988
The Freelancer's gonna cause
a building collapse.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.605
I've been in contact
with the City Planner's office

30:14.605 --> 30:16.023
in Arlington.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.816
<i>Laurel Vistas is
an 80-year-old property</i>

30:17.816 --> 30:20.694
that's had 7 different owners
in the last 10 years alone.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.197
It's racked up more code
violations in that period

30:23.197 --> 30:24.823
then I have time to read out.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.493
But several involve
water damage near a retaining wall

30:27.493 --> 30:29.954
in the basement that backs
onto the Potomac Aquifer.

30:29.954 --> 30:31.497
That water could take out
the whole building.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.748
<i>You need to get down there.</i>

30:32.748 --> 30:34.416
<i>And Malik, you're on Perry.</i>

30:54.687 --> 30:55.729
Hey!

30:57.398 --> 30:58.774
Stop!

31:01.777 --> 31:02.945
Mr. Perry.

31:02.945 --> 31:05.364
Waiting for the perfect shot?

31:05.364 --> 31:06.615
Or just waiting for us?

31:06.615 --> 31:07.866
What? What do you mean?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.410
Let's go, shutterbug.

31:30.264 --> 31:31.640
Show me your hands!

31:31.640 --> 31:33.058
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.435
I'm unarmed.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.479
How 'bout a horse trade, huh?

31:38.772 --> 31:40.566
I show you how to undo
the damage I've just done,

31:40.566 --> 31:41.817
and you let me...

32:07.801 --> 32:10.137
He's alive. But out cold.

32:13.349 --> 32:16.060
Uh, mayday-- We've got
bigger problems over here.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.937
You smell gas?

32:20.230 --> 32:22.983
Looks like the chemical ate
through the main gas line.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.821
What's the update?

32:27.821 --> 32:29.615
The Freelancer's unconscious
and in custody.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.951
We have one civilian down,
and a live incendiary device.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.787
I'm willing to bet
when this timer goes off,

32:34.787 --> 32:36.246
it'll overload the fuse box.

32:36.246 --> 32:38.040
Gonna be a shower of sparks.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.084
<i>Agent Malik is working
with Arlington County Police</i>

32:40.084 --> 32:41.502
to evacuate the building.

32:41.502 --> 32:42.878
If you're down there
when the wall goes,

32:42.878 --> 32:44.505
you'll drown under tons
of mud and silt.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.006
You need to leave, now.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.466
No, there's not enough time
to get everyone out.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.259
Then we're not going anywhere.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.888
I don't know which wire to pull.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.682
Any one of them could set it off.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.183
What if we cut the main power?

32:56.183 --> 32:58.686
No power, no sparks, no...

32:58.686 --> 33:00.646
Better than any idea I've got.

33:04.692 --> 33:07.194
Let's hope this works.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.411
All right.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.496
No power, no sparks.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.872
We're good.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.917
No.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.086
We're not.

33:31.385 --> 33:33.053
<i>Rogelio just got a tip,</i>

33:33.053 --> 33:34.930
the collapse of an apartment
building in Arlington.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.056
<i>Yes, we got it.</i>

33:36.056 --> 33:37.516
Is everyone safe?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.268
For now.

33:39.268 --> 33:40.519
Good.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.604
But Veseli got away.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.274
That is not so good.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.196
It started with a photo.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.906
Six or seven years ago,

33:52.906 --> 33:55.492
I was covering this reception
at a hotel near Dupont.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.161
A big fundraiser thing.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.746
I was getting nothing shots,

33:58.746 --> 34:01.123
so I went around
to the back of the building.

34:01.123 --> 34:04.001
Thought I could get someone
sneaking in, sneaking out.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.254
I see someone standing on the curb

34:07.254 --> 34:08.672
over by the loading dock.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.592
I swear to God,
it's Raymond Reddington,

34:11.592 --> 34:13.177
talking with this Latino guy.

34:13.886 --> 34:16.305
But before I could
get my camera ready and snapping,

34:16.305 --> 34:18.140
Reddington steps into the street,

34:18.140 --> 34:20.184
ducks into a waiting car, and is gone.

34:21.852 --> 34:24.563
I get a-- a blurry pic
of the back of his head.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.231
I couldn't sell the damn thing anywhere.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.858
Nobody would believe me
that it was Reddington.

34:28.776 --> 34:30.778
I got one outlet to pay me for it.

34:30.778 --> 34:32.237
Tabloid.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.822
Even they speculated.

34:35.449 --> 34:39.077
God, if I could've just proved it,

34:40.454 --> 34:42.331
it would've been one helluva payday.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.958
Then, all of a sudden,
a few months ago,

34:44.958 --> 34:46.627
someone shows at my door

34:46.627 --> 34:48.670
and wants to know
about the photograph.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.298
Said he worked for somebody.

34:51.298 --> 34:52.382
Um...

34:53.550 --> 34:54.968
Wu-something.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.638
They wanted to know
about the photo

34:57.638 --> 34:59.389
and who the guy
with Reddington was.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.519
Then they said they wanted me
to take some new photos.

35:13.529 --> 35:15.197
You really can't stay for dinner?

35:15.197 --> 35:18.033
Sadly, it's time for me
to head back to New York.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.910
Soledad's paella is legendary.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.495
It has a cult following.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.372
And it's not nearly as good reheated.

35:23.372 --> 35:25.249
I'll be the judge of that.

35:26.792 --> 35:30.254
Rogelio, please tell
your lovely wife

35:30.254 --> 35:33.549
that her hospitality,
much like her paella,

35:33.549 --> 35:35.634
is unrivaled.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.427
Yours as well.

35:37.427 --> 35:42.641
Your sheets
are truly the finest I have ever slept on.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.311
I have the utmost faith
in your new business endeavor.

35:46.311 --> 35:47.729
I hope you'll give us
an endorsement

35:47.729 --> 35:49.189
when the time comes.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.566
You can be in our first commercial.

35:50.566 --> 35:52.234
Wouldn't that be something?

35:52.234 --> 35:53.902
But the least I can do is invest.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.237
Tell me how much you need.

35:55.237 --> 35:56.697
Ah, that-- That's generous, Raymond.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.782
- But no, thank you.
- A hundred thousand?

35:58.782 --> 36:02.244
You don't understand.
I-- I don't need you to invest.

36:02.244 --> 36:05.581
Working for you, I've grown
my intelligence network

36:05.581 --> 36:08.876
from the city to the region
to the entire country.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.419
I've built a nice nest egg.

36:11.003 --> 36:15.299
So, I'm using it
to help pay for my dream.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.844
You're evolving, my friend.
You don't need me anymore.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.763
Raymond, no, I'd never dare say that.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.640
Yeah, I owe you.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.100
Everything.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.643
I just don't need you for this.

36:26.643 --> 36:30.397
Well, the day you do need
an investor or a spokesman

36:30.397 --> 36:32.858
who happens to be
on the most wanted list,

36:32.858 --> 36:34.943
click your heels and there I'll be.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.989
In the meantime, I need
two sets of those sheets.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.657
Queen size.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.868
<i>Claro.</i> You got it, amigo.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.040
Hey.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.416
You, uh, nauseous?

36:50.626 --> 36:52.002
Yeah, thanks.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.879
Yeah, the first week's the hardest.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.756
Feels like your, uh, blood's on fire?

36:55.756 --> 36:58.050
- Yeah, and your veins might explode.
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.927
At least, at this point,
I'm praying they do.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.553
How many days are you?

37:01.553 --> 37:02.804
Uh, four.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.264
Uh, four and a half.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.515
Mm. Don't knock the half.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.100
It's an accomplishment.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.187
I know it doesn't seem like it
at this point, but it is.

37:10.187 --> 37:11.521
Donald.

37:11.521 --> 37:12.981
Jonathan.

37:19.947 --> 37:23.617
How did Mr. Hambright
work out for you today?

37:23.617 --> 37:25.494
He's actually proven
to be quite useful.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.954
More than once.

37:26.954 --> 37:28.830
Quite a character, isn't he?

37:28.830 --> 37:30.540
To say the least.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.126
You're headed back up
the turnpike?

37:33.126 --> 37:35.253
I've got that coaster to ride.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.131
Listen, I told Agnes

37:38.131 --> 37:42.094
that saltwater taffy
will be the order of the day

37:42.094 --> 37:45.055
on my next jaunt
through the Garden State.

37:45.055 --> 37:47.975
So beware, I'll be
bringing her a bundle.

37:47.975 --> 37:51.144
Maybe she could share it with the boy
she's got a crush on at school.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.230
Agnes has a young suitor?

37:53.230 --> 37:55.023
She's only told Charlene.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.109
I'm still waiting for her
to come to me with the news.

37:58.235 --> 38:01.363
I admire the relationship
you've built with her.

38:02.656 --> 38:05.075
Fatherhood isn't for
the faint of heart.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.536
Some days I find myself
wondering if...

38:08.704 --> 38:10.497
If everything else is worth it.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.874
The job. The Blacklist.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.835
How much it takes me away
from her.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.880
I miss that little girl every moment
I'm not with her.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.382
Yeah.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.010
And I hate to tell you,

38:23.010 --> 38:25.095
but we're not getting
any younger, Harold.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.555
No, we're not.

38:26.555 --> 38:28.265
And it seems like every time
we stop a threat,

38:28.265 --> 38:29.933
it just begets three more.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.436
It's a disastrous domino effect.

38:33.145 --> 38:36.815
Taking down Marvin Gerard
sets in motion

38:36.815 --> 38:40.110
a chain of events
that eventually sinks a ferry.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.653
And The Freelancer is still out there.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.905
Do you think he has
anything else planned for us?

38:43.905 --> 38:45.991
I haven't the foggiest.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.868
Wujing has gotten what he wanted.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.536
He did, didn't he?

38:49.536 --> 38:51.038
It's the one thing
I haven't been able

38:51.038 --> 38:53.123
- to stop thinking about.
- What?

38:53.123 --> 38:55.208
Photographs of the task force.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.501
Concrete evidence.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.462
Now that Wujing has them,

38:58.462 --> 39:00.672
what's he planning to do with them?

39:05.385 --> 39:06.803
Time will tell.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.898
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.568
I was surprised when
you wanted it to be here.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.111
And without protection.

39:24.196 --> 39:26.907
I wouldn't say that.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.331
I see.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.668
You have the high ground.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.170
What do you want?

39:40.837 --> 39:44.841
My employer is interested
in hiring your... team

39:46.218 --> 39:47.969
to remove a common threat.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.972
I don't have to tell you
anything about Raymond Reddington

39:50.972 --> 39:52.974
you don't already know.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.144
Reddington.

39:57.813 --> 40:01.483
It is my understanding
that Marvin Gerard contracted

40:01.483 --> 40:03.568
your forces to take out Reddington

40:03.568 --> 40:05.362
as part of their war last year.

40:05.362 --> 40:06.738
Yeah.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.615
And now our colleague, Henrick Fisker,

40:08.615 --> 40:10.909
is rotting in a CIA black site.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.786
Hm.

40:12.786 --> 40:17.082
What if I told you
that those two things--

40:17.082 --> 40:19.709
Raymond Reddington still alive

40:19.709 --> 40:23.046
and your brother in arms in custody,

40:23.046 --> 40:24.840
were directly related?

40:27.300 --> 40:28.552
I'm listening.

40:28.552 --> 40:31.221
Reddington has
an immunity agreement

40:31.221 --> 40:34.766
and a covert FBI task force
that does his bidding

40:34.766 --> 40:37.018
and allows him
to grow his empire with impunity.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.520
I don't believe you.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.397
What if I can prove it?

40:46.570 --> 40:48.780
Show me proof, and then we'll talk.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.459
We fed three tips

41:01.459 --> 41:03.962
to part of Reddington's
intelligence network,

41:03.962 --> 41:06.173
and three times
his federal pack hounds

41:06.173 --> 41:10.510
showed up to investigate before
they were declared a crime.

41:10.510 --> 41:13.221
Agent Donald Ressler, FBI.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.682
Agent Dembe Zuma, FBI.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.559
Agent Siya Malik,

41:17.559 --> 41:20.478
a curveball, is actually MI6.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.276
Interesting. Hm.

41:26.610 --> 41:27.944
To say the least.

41:28.904 --> 41:32.157
So, does this satisfy
your requirement for proof?

41:33.074 --> 41:34.618
What do you think?

41:37.579 --> 41:41.041
I think you should tell your employer

41:41.041 --> 41:45.253
that we are very, very expensive.
