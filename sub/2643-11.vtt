WEBVTT

00:06.873 --> 00:08.192
Water Demon.

00:10.018 --> 00:11.502
Ice Dragon.

00:12.370 --> 00:15.673
Lesser Warlord
of Ka'a.

00:15.674 --> 00:18.709
Not so fast.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.477
Infinite Sheldon.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.614
Infinite Sheldon?

00:23.615 --> 00:26.317
Yes, Infinite Sheldon
defeats all other cards

00:26.318 --> 00:28.903
and does not violate the
rule against homemade cards

00:28.904 --> 00:30.821
because I made
it at work.

00:32.290 --> 00:35.659
Do you understand why people
don't want to play with you?

00:35.660 --> 00:37.261
No...

00:37.262 --> 00:40.698
although it's a question I've
been pondering since preschool.

00:41.716 --> 00:42.750
Hey.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.717
Hey.

00:43.718 --> 00:45.469
Hey.

00:45.470 --> 00:47.421
Hey, your copy of <i>Science</i>
magazine was in my mailbox.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.340
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.575
Check it out--
all about planets this month.

00:51.576 --> 00:53.611
That's an atom.

00:54.479 --> 00:57.081
Agree to disagree.

00:57.949 --> 00:59.450
That's what I love
about science--

00:59.451 --> 01:02.152
there's no
one right answer.

01:05.223 --> 01:07.224
So...

01:07.225 --> 01:08.826
you and Zack again, huh?

01:08.827 --> 01:10.761
Yeah, yeah, me
and Zack again.

01:10.762 --> 01:12.363
Were we here earlier?

01:13.899 --> 01:15.199
Okay, we should,
we should go.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.250
Ah, not yet.

01:16.251 --> 01:18.619
I want to talk science
with the science dudes.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.406
Oh, and the science dudes want
to talk science with you.

01:23.775 --> 01:24.875
What do you want
to talk about--

01:24.876 --> 01:29.013
rocks, dinosaurs, our
friend the beaver?

01:30.181 --> 01:32.516
You know, I saw this great thing
on the Discovery Channel.

01:32.517 --> 01:34.385
Turns out
that if you kill a starfish,

01:34.386 --> 01:36.553
it'll just come back to life.

01:38.356 --> 01:40.224
Was the starfish
wearing boxer shorts?

01:40.225 --> 01:42.493
Because you might have
been watching Nickelodeon.

01:45.463 --> 01:48.899
No, I'm almost sure that
it was the Discovery Channel.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.167
It was a great show.

01:50.168 --> 01:52.336
They also said dolphins
might be smarter than people.

01:52.337 --> 01:55.940
They might be smarter
than <i>some</i> people.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.661
Maybe we can do an
experiment to find out.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.112
That's easy enough.

02:02.113 --> 02:05.215
We'd need a large tank of
water, a hoop to jump through,

02:05.216 --> 02:07.651
and a bucket of whatever
bite-sized treats

02:07.652 --> 02:09.787
you find tasty.

02:15.327 --> 02:18.162
I don't get it.

02:18.163 --> 02:19.596
A dolphin might.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.201
Oh, I see.

02:24.202 --> 02:26.337
You guys are inferring
that I'm stupid.

02:26.338 --> 02:27.604
That's not correct.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.491
We were implying it.

02:30.492 --> 02:32.710
You then inferred it.

02:36.247 --> 02:38.682
Let's go.

02:39.484 --> 02:41.652
You know, for a group of guys

02:41.653 --> 02:44.288
who claim they spent most
of their lives being bullied,

02:44.289 --> 02:45.839
you can be real jerks.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.658
Shame on all of you.

02:49.995 --> 02:52.329
What the hell did I do?

02:53.131 --> 02:54.831
You laughed.

03:21.831 --> 03:22.719
Do you think
Penny's right?

03:22.798 --> 03:24.449
Were we bullying Zack?

03:24.450 --> 03:25.200
No,

03:25.288 --> 03:26.655
I know bullying.

03:26.656 --> 03:30.492
He left here unswirlied and his
ass crack was underpants-free.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.529
And nobody drew
a penis on his forehead.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.666
That happened to you?

03:37.667 --> 03:40.335
First day of cricket camp.

03:40.336 --> 03:43.772
They drew it
so the testicles were my eyes.

03:47.110 --> 03:49.745
I don't know, I think
we might owe the guy an apology.

03:49.746 --> 03:52.214
So go apologize.
Why me?

03:52.215 --> 03:55.384
You started it,
we just piled on.

03:55.385 --> 03:57.352
What would I even say?

03:57.353 --> 04:00.055
Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

04:02.025 --> 04:04.326
Have a Milk Dud.

04:05.061 --> 04:07.196
A Milk Dud?
Yeah,

04:07.197 --> 04:09.631
Milk Duds,
with their self-deprecating name

04:09.632 --> 04:11.333
and remarkably mild flavor,

04:11.334 --> 04:15.304
are the most apologetic
of the boxed candies.

04:15.305 --> 04:16.704
I got a better idea.

04:16.706 --> 04:17.673
We're all responsible.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.874
I say we all go.

04:22.545 --> 04:24.079
Come on, who's with me?

04:25.548 --> 04:29.184
Free comic books
to anyone who comes with me.

04:30.453 --> 04:32.354
I might get punched.
You really want to miss that?

04:37.894 --> 04:39.962
Junior Mints are
pretty apologetic.

04:39.963 --> 04:42.130
You're embarrassing
yourself.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.570
Penny.

04:52.342 --> 04:54.209
What?
Yeah,

04:54.210 --> 04:55.911
we came to talk to Zack.
Hey, Zack.

04:55.912 --> 04:57.112
What do you want?

04:57.113 --> 04:58.480
Listen,

04:58.481 --> 04:59.581
the stuff
we were saying before--

04:59.582 --> 05:01.149
we were just kidding around.

05:01.150 --> 05:02.084
No, you weren't.

05:02.085 --> 05:03.752
You were making fun
of me.

05:03.753 --> 05:05.387
Come on, that's what we do.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.489
We give each other a hard time.

05:07.490 --> 05:08.690
Hey, Sheldon,

05:08.691 --> 05:10.893
you look
like a praying mantis.

05:11.828 --> 05:13.795
That's very hurtful.

05:13.796 --> 05:16.098
See?

05:16.099 --> 05:18.934
I don't know,
it still wasn't very nice.

05:18.935 --> 05:21.436
Milk Dud?

05:21.437 --> 05:23.205
Oh, I love Milk Duds.

05:24.474 --> 05:26.875
Okay, we're cool.

05:28.711 --> 05:31.547
Junior Mints.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.115
You guys want to come in
and have a beer?

05:33.116 --> 05:34.917
Uh, we're on our way
to the comic book store.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.618
Leonard's buying.

05:36.619 --> 05:37.653
Really?

05:37.654 --> 05:38.854
I haven't been
to a comic book store

05:38.855 --> 05:40.422
in literally
a million years.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.024
Literally?

05:42.025 --> 05:45.360
Literally a
million years?

05:45.361 --> 05:47.062
Don't.

05:47.063 --> 05:48.330
You want to go with 'em?
No.

05:48.331 --> 05:49.731
Okay, see you later.
Wait,

05:49.732 --> 05:54.503
w-w-w-wait, you're ditching me
to go look at comic books?

05:54.504 --> 05:55.704
Are you mad at me?

05:55.705 --> 05:58.440
I'm not happy.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.510
Milk Dud?

06:05.181 --> 06:07.249
Wow, this place
is awesome.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.551
Where do they keep
the <i>Archies?</i>

06:09.552 --> 06:12.921
In the bedrooms of ten-year-
old girls, where they belong.

06:12.922 --> 06:15.807
Oh, no, you're thinking
old-school <i>Archie.</i>

06:15.808 --> 06:17.626
It's much more
sophisticated now.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.727
Like, there's
two universes,

06:18.728 --> 06:20.662
and Archie's married
to Betty in one

06:20.663 --> 06:21.730
and Veronica
in the other.

06:21.731 --> 06:24.032
Midge is even breaking
up with Moose.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.934
No.

06:25.935 --> 06:27.636
About time, right?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.137
Hey.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.608
Hey.
You guys finally chip in
for a bodyguard?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.677
Uh, no. Oh,
this is Zack.

06:35.678 --> 06:37.079
He's a friend
of ours.

06:37.080 --> 06:37.980
Zack, this is Stuart.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.815
He owns
the store.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.416
Wow, lucky you.

06:41.417 --> 06:44.152
Yeah, I work
70 hours a week

06:44.153 --> 06:47.022
and average
$1.65 an hour.

06:47.023 --> 06:49.358
Sweet.

06:50.226 --> 06:52.527
Is that sarcasm?

06:52.528 --> 06:56.164
No, it's an indictment of the
American education system.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.934
The <i>Archies</i> are over here.

06:58.935 --> 07:00.886
Yippee.

07:02.472 --> 07:05.407
So are you guys coming to
my New Year's Eve costume party?

07:05.408 --> 07:06.675
Of course.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.694
We're coming as the
Justice League of America.

07:08.695 --> 07:09.811
Switching it up from last year

07:09.812 --> 07:12.731
when we came as
the Justice League of America.

07:12.732 --> 07:13.982
To that point,

07:13.983 --> 07:17.753
it occurs to me that we
might have an opportunity

07:17.754 --> 07:20.255
to finally snare
Best Group Costume

07:20.256 --> 07:22.691
if we shore up
our weak link,

07:22.692 --> 07:25.494
which is clearly
Leonard as Superman.

07:26.329 --> 07:28.430
Hey, I got
new boots this year.

07:28.431 --> 07:30.799
Guaranteed to add
three inches.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.669
That's sad.

07:35.041 --> 07:38.740
Let's ask ourselves...
Is there anyone we know

07:38.741 --> 07:43.278
who would make a more manly
and convincing son of Krypton?

07:43.279 --> 07:45.580
Than Leonard
in high-heeled boots?

07:46.516 --> 07:49.718
Howard's mother
in high-heeled boots?

07:52.321 --> 07:55.791
I was thinking specifically
of the gentleman over there

07:55.792 --> 07:57.492
moving his lips
as he enjoys

07:57.493 --> 07:59.795
the latest exploits
of Betty and Veronica.

08:03.199 --> 08:05.767
Zack?

08:05.768 --> 08:09.404
He is the only person we know
with actual muscles.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.507
You can't replace
me with Zack.

08:12.508 --> 08:15.243
Why not?
Penny did it.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.179
Yeah, she seems happier.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.580
Why wouldn't we be?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.981
Score.

08:19.982 --> 08:21.950
I got an <i>Archie,
Betty and Veronica,</i>

08:21.951 --> 08:23.251
and a <i>Jughead.</i>

08:23.252 --> 08:26.421
All set
for my weekend number twos.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.458
Congratulations.

08:29.459 --> 08:33.095
Zack, how would you
like to be Superman?

08:33.096 --> 08:36.298
I don't know, sounds like
a lot of responsibility.

08:40.535 --> 08:42.337
Fine, if Zack's going
to be Superman,

08:42.337 --> 08:43.739
I want to be
Green Lantern.

08:43.740 --> 08:44.706
But I'm Green Lantern.

08:44.707 --> 08:46.124
You can be Aquaman.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.459
I don't want to be Aquaman.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.661
He sucks.

08:50.546 --> 08:52.781
He sucks
underwater.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.585
He sucks
fish pee.

08:56.586 --> 08:57.753
Excuse me,

08:57.754 --> 09:01.156
I believe Aquaman uses
his telepathic powers

09:01.157 --> 09:05.460
to request the fish do
their business elsewhere.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.062
Hey, babe.

09:07.063 --> 09:08.146
I'm still mad at you.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.131
Well, you won't be

09:09.132 --> 09:10.232
when you hear the great news.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.266
What great news?

09:11.267 --> 09:12.868
We're going to
a costume party

09:12.869 --> 09:15.403
at the comic book store
on New Year's Eve,

09:15.404 --> 09:18.173
and you get to
be Wonder Woman.

09:19.375 --> 09:22.677
Complete with bulletproof
bracelets and lasso of truth.

09:23.346 --> 09:25.447
Invisible plane sold separately.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.749
Wait, why me?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.751
Wh-Why can't your girlfriend
be Wonder Woman?

09:29.752 --> 09:32.320
She and her lab team
are under quarantine.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.890
Seems at the Christmas party
they were doing Jell-O shots

09:34.891 --> 09:38.960
out of petri dishes that used
to contain yellow fever.

09:40.196 --> 09:42.998
Okay, what about
your friend Amy?

09:42.999 --> 09:46.101
Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't
believe in wearing costumes.

09:46.102 --> 09:49.171
She isn't the free spirit I am.

09:51.707 --> 09:52.841
Okay, well, forget it.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.509
I'm not spending
my New Year's Eve

09:54.510 --> 09:57.345
at a comic book store
wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

09:59.282 --> 10:02.651
He says he'll wear it
if you'll be Aquaman.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:16.188 --> 10:17.679
What are you doing?

10:18.267 --> 10:19.551
We're going
to be late.

10:19.635 --> 10:22.170
I'm pacing nervously.

10:22.171 --> 10:23.405
You're jogging.

10:23.406 --> 10:26.741
This is how the
Flash paces.

10:26.742 --> 10:29.411
Just chill out, Sheldon.

10:29.412 --> 10:32.347
I'm not Sheldon.
I'm the Flash.

10:32.348 --> 10:33.949
And now I'm going
to the Grand Canyon

10:33.950 --> 10:35.250
to scream in frustration.

10:35.251 --> 10:37.485
I'm back.

10:40.022 --> 10:43.258
I'm Batman.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.460
Oh, I hardly think so.

10:45.461 --> 10:47.996
The real caped crusader calls
his crime-fighting cohorts

10:47.997 --> 10:49.097
when he's running late.

10:49.098 --> 10:51.499
I had to walk.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.569
I couldn't get Raj
on the back of my scooter.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.412
I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.582
Aquaman sucks.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.151
Look up in the sky.
It's a bird. It's a plane.

11:11.988 --> 11:14.756
I forget the rest.

11:15.858 --> 11:19.728
All right. Let's get
this thing over with.

11:19.729 --> 11:21.429
I'm sorry.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.265
But in what universe
is Wonder Woman blonde?

11:24.266 --> 11:27.235
Relax. No one's going to
be looking at her hair.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.440
Ow!

11:33.276 --> 11:34.276
I mean,

11:34.277 --> 11:36.444
ow.

11:37.546 --> 11:38.647
Hold on. The costume came

11:38.648 --> 11:39.781
with a black wig.
Where is it, babe?

11:39.782 --> 11:41.816
No. I'm not wearing
it. It looks stupid.

11:41.817 --> 11:43.418
Come on. We're trying
to win a contest here.

11:43.419 --> 11:44.686
Forget it. I'm not
wearing the wig.

11:44.687 --> 11:48.823
Honey, there's no "I"
in "Justice League."

11:50.459 --> 11:53.345
Well, actually...

11:53.346 --> 11:55.864
Don't.
He's making our case.

11:55.865 --> 11:57.732
Okay, babe. Uh...

11:57.733 --> 12:00.902
Kind of embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

12:00.903 --> 12:02.637
Okay.
You know what?

12:02.638 --> 12:04.639
I changed my mind.
I'm not going.

12:06.008 --> 12:08.326
Looks like someone
else is going

12:08.327 --> 12:10.745
to have to be Wonder Woman.

12:15.051 --> 12:16.785
Babe, open up.

12:16.786 --> 12:18.319
I'm not talking to you.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.522
Then who are you talking to?

12:23.326 --> 12:26.494
Babe?

12:26.495 --> 12:29.364
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny,

12:29.365 --> 12:32.166
Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

12:32.167 --> 12:33.535
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny

12:33.536 --> 12:34.769
Penny, Penny...

12:34.770 --> 12:37.689
What the hell
is wrong with you?

12:37.690 --> 12:38.873
I'm the Flash.

12:38.874 --> 12:40.575
I just knocked 30,000 times.

12:40.576 --> 12:42.727
Okay. What do you
want, Sheldon?

12:42.728 --> 12:45.547
I understand
why you're upset.

12:45.548 --> 12:46.948
Really?

12:46.949 --> 12:48.316
Yes.

12:48.317 --> 12:51.619
You're afraid that costume
makes you look fat.

12:53.656 --> 12:54.956
No.

12:54.957 --> 12:56.124
Wh-What...

12:56.125 --> 12:58.159
Does it?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.527
Don't worry.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.062
Wonder Woman
was an Amazon.

13:01.063 --> 13:05.767
And Amazons tend to
be very beefy gals.

13:08.270 --> 13:10.722
Good-bye, Sheldon.

13:12.575 --> 13:15.877
But they're not blonde,
so put on your wig.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.048
Hello?

13:29.959 --> 13:34.162
Stupid Aquaman.

13:35.931 --> 13:37.298
If it makes you
feel any better,

13:37.299 --> 13:38.533
when I was dating Penny,

13:38.534 --> 13:40.101
she used to flip out
on me all the time.

13:40.102 --> 13:42.337
Whoa. You dated Penny?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.707
She didn't tell you?

13:45.708 --> 13:47.942
She told me she dated
a guy named Leonard.

13:47.943 --> 13:50.078
Who would have
thought it was you?

13:50.079 --> 13:52.747
Who else would it be?

13:52.748 --> 13:55.550
I don't know. Somebody
bigger and...

13:55.551 --> 13:58.153
Yeah, sure.
Why not you?

14:01.757 --> 14:04.092
I may have failed.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.729
Okay, I guess we just go
without a Wonder Woman.

14:07.730 --> 14:09.063
I don't want to go
without Penny.

14:09.064 --> 14:12.767
Oh, great. No Superman,
no Wonder Woman?

14:12.768 --> 14:15.203
All we've got is a skinny Flash,

14:15.204 --> 14:16.638
an Indian Aquaman,

14:16.639 --> 14:17.639
a nearsighted
Green Lantern,

14:17.640 --> 14:19.874
and a teeny, tiny
Dark Knight.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.380
Obviously, we're no longer
a Justice League.

14:25.381 --> 14:29.617
We have no choice but to switch
to our Muppet Baby costumes.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.421
Ooh, I call Kermit.

14:33.422 --> 14:35.457
I'm Kermit.
You're Scooter.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.860
Oh, man.
Scooter sucks.

14:38.861 --> 14:42.664
He's the Aquaman
of the Muppet Babies.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.401
No, we can still
make this work.

14:46.402 --> 14:47.969
Leonard,
you talk to Penny.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.971
What makes you think
I can convince her?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.806
You got her
to have sex with you.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.859
Obviously, your superpower
is brainwashing.

14:57.696 --> 15:00.748
Okay, let me see
if I understand this.

15:00.749 --> 15:02.984
You want me
to convince my ex-girlfriend

15:02.985 --> 15:05.753
to go to a costume party
with her new boyfriend

15:05.754 --> 15:07.822
just so we can win
a stupid prize?

15:07.823 --> 15:10.592
Yes. And make her wear
the black wig. Good luck.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.462
Go away, Sheldon.

15:14.463 --> 15:15.763
It's Leonard.

15:15.764 --> 15:17.098
Oh.

15:17.099 --> 15:19.350
Go away, Leonard.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.569
Come on, let me
just talk to you.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.771
It's open.

15:23.772 --> 15:25.573
Hey.

15:25.574 --> 15:27.342
I'm not going
to that party, Leonard.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.811
Okay, listen.
You don't have to wear the wig.

15:29.812 --> 15:31.813
At this party,
we're gonna win first prize

15:31.814 --> 15:33.915
just by showing up with a girl.

15:33.916 --> 15:37.018
It's not the wig.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.786
Did I do something?

15:38.787 --> 15:40.488
I mean, I tried to be
friends with Zack,

15:40.489 --> 15:42.991
like you said, which believe me,
was difficult,

15:42.992 --> 15:45.360
given how you and me
used to be...

15:45.361 --> 15:46.961
you know, "you and
me," and now you

15:46.962 --> 15:49.464
and him are
"you and him."

15:49.465 --> 15:52.600
Okay, look.
We're not really "me and him."

15:52.601 --> 15:54.235
Then what are you?

15:54.236 --> 15:56.203
I don't know.

15:56.204 --> 15:58.439
I only started seeing Zack again

15:58.440 --> 16:00.475
so I wouldn't be alone
on New Year's Eve.

16:00.476 --> 16:02.710
How pathetic is that?

16:02.711 --> 16:05.246
Not as pathetic
as dressing up like this

16:05.247 --> 16:08.316
and going to a comic book store
on New Year's Eve.

16:08.317 --> 16:10.985
You make a cute Green Arrow.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.059
Green Lantern.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.162
Like there's a difference.

16:21.163 --> 16:23.131
There's a big difference.

16:23.132 --> 16:25.166
Arrow.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.268
Lantern.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.973
Whatever. Look,
if Zack and I had just gone

16:31.974 --> 16:34.408
to a regular club or a party,
it would have been fine,

16:34.409 --> 16:36.410
but this, with the costumes,
and you...

16:36.411 --> 16:37.845
What about me?

16:40.149 --> 16:42.383
Nothing.

16:42.384 --> 16:44.469
Let's go to the party.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.421
How do I look?

16:52.761 --> 16:54.329
Um...

16:54.330 --> 16:56.764
I guarantee you'll be
the prettiest girl there.

16:57.833 --> 17:01.169
Okay, the good news is,
we have a Wonder Woman.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.287
Oh.
Yes.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.404
What's the bad news?

17:03.405 --> 17:04.739
Superman probably isn't

17:04.740 --> 17:06.608
getting laid tonight.

17:08.676 --> 17:11.462
Aw, damn.

17:12.647 --> 17:14.715
And the award

17:14.717 --> 17:17.218
for best group costume
goes to...

17:18.153 --> 17:20.221
Justice League of America...

17:25.894 --> 17:26.894
Number three!

17:30.232 --> 17:33.368
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

17:33.369 --> 17:36.237
Okay. Okay, ten
seconds to midnight.

17:36.238 --> 17:37.372
Ten, nine, eight...

17:37.373 --> 17:38.823
No, wait!

17:38.824 --> 17:40.174
I have a speech.

17:40.175 --> 17:41.743
Seven, six...
Stop counting!

17:41.744 --> 17:44.479
Five, four, three...
This is my moment, dag nab it!

17:44.480 --> 17:45.780
Two, one!

17:45.781 --> 17:49.834
Happy New Year!

18:00.195 --> 18:03.164
I'm not going
to say another word

18:03.165 --> 18:05.533
until you people settle down.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.505
I'm waiting.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.777
That was a
great party.

18:15.778 --> 18:18.363
We should dress like
this all the time.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.199
Are you high?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.317
You're being
a bully.

18:26.321 --> 18:28.489
Check it out.

18:28.490 --> 18:30.024
Those guys are breaking
into that car.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.060
What should we do?

18:32.061 --> 18:33.795
We're the Justice League
of America.

18:33.796 --> 18:36.497
There's only one thing
we can do.

18:36.498 --> 18:38.933
Turn around
and slowly walk away.

18:47.076 --> 18:49.093
Nah.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.262
Hold up.

18:55.761 --> 18:57.830
Look, I know our winter
thermostat setting

18:57.915 --> 18:59.582
is 72 degrees,
but I'm a little warm,

18:59.583 --> 19:01.117
so I'm going
to turn it down.

19:25.409 --> 19:27.210
Good Lord,

19:27.211 --> 19:31.781
how you frustrate me,
Leonard Hofstadter!
