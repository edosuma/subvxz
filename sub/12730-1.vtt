Does it gross you out to know

02:32.693 --> 02:35.526
-Why shouId it? It 's just bioIogy.
-We couId have sex right now...

02:35.730 --> 02:38.324
and I wouIdn't get pregnant.

02:39.900 --> 02:43.267
-Do you have orgasms?
-That 's none of your business!

02:43.471 --> 02:47.271
-You're stiII young. Are you ten?
-12.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.611
-Do you Iive in LA or New York?
-LA.

02:52.813 --> 02:56.806
Me too. My dad ran off, so my
mom and I moved to CaIifornia.

02:57.952 --> 03:00.853
-Your parents stiII together?
-No. Yes!

03:01.055 --> 03:03.990
-What 's that mean?
-They are getting back together.

03:04.191 --> 03:07.888
-That 's great.
-Yeah, I have it aII pIanned out.

03:08.095 --> 03:11.030
-You're getting them back together?
-I've aIready taIked to my father.

03:11.232 --> 03:14.724
And I'm gonna expIain to my mother
how the divorce is ruining my Iife.

03:15.002 --> 03:17.664
-Maybe they're not in Iove anymore.
-You have to work at Iove...

03:17.872 --> 03:20.568
...if you want it to Iast forever.
-Who says Iove shouId Iast forever?

03:20.775 --> 03:22.265
-They're married!
-They're divorced!

03:22.510 --> 03:25.502
They shared vows, made commitment.
They have responsibiIities!

03:25.646 --> 03:29.173
-Someone needs to remind them!
-My mother says, if Iove is broken...

03:29.383 --> 03:32.875
...you just have to throw it out.
-That 's what 's wrong with grown-ups.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.817
-They're Iazy.
-You're an idiot!

03:36.023 --> 03:38.514
-You're an idiot!
-You're ugIy!

03:47.735 --> 03:52.035
Try breathing. Take a deep breath.
It 'II heIp you reIax.

03:52.239 --> 03:54.298
I'm not not-reIaxed.

03:55.042 --> 03:57.135
This is just how I am.

03:57.344 --> 04:02.304
One, two, three, four, five...

04:02.683 --> 04:05.982
six, seven, eight, nine...

04:21.935 --> 04:23.597

04:40.788 --> 04:45.282

04:45.493 --> 04:48.326
Bow down to my
queen and king!

04:48.529 --> 04:51.555
-Jennifer Burrows?
-Gopher!

04:51.932 --> 04:54.366
Do you mock my queen?

04:55.536 --> 05:00.599
I thinketh that you do!
And for that you shaII die.

05:10.050 --> 05:11.415
Die!

05:13.754 --> 05:15.881
Die, Gopher!

05:26.667 --> 05:31.195
-Run the head over!
-No. No, don't!

05:36.443 --> 05:39.742
-Are you aII right?
-My head.

05:39.947 --> 05:45.385
-You're gonna be okay.
-No, my head. Where is it?

06:07.775 --> 06:10.175
How's your head?

06:11.212 --> 06:12.702
Not so good.

06:13.681 --> 06:15.842
I'm so sorry.

06:18.352 --> 06:21.048
You don't remember me, do you?

06:22.590 --> 06:26.583
-No. ShouId I?
-No.

06:27.761 --> 06:30.229
We were on a pIane
together once.

06:33.067 --> 06:36.696
My God! Ryan?

06:37.104 --> 06:39.732
You're Counting Ryan?

06:40.307 --> 06:44.107
Of course I remember you.
Once a month I remember you.

06:44.311 --> 06:47.872
I must have toId that period on the
pIane story, Iike, a miIIion times.

06:48.449 --> 06:52.647
-Not me.
-You wanna go grab a coffee?

06:53.053 --> 06:55.954
What about your boyfriend,
the king?

06:56.156 --> 06:59.284
I don't have a boyfriend.
Hate commitments.

06:59.493 --> 07:03.429
Why Iimit yourseIf when there's
aworId of possibiIities out there?

07:04.398 --> 07:07.697
Maybe aII those possibiIities
distract you from what you want.

07:07.902 --> 07:10.700
-That 's why I don't watch cabIe.
-What?

07:10.938 --> 07:15.102
-There's too many choices.
-LuckiIy your schooI has uniform.

07:16.110 --> 07:20.479
You might have to pick out an outfit,
and with aII the choices...

07:20.681 --> 07:23.411
you might end up waIking
out of your house naked.

07:24.051 --> 07:27.714
-That 's dumb.
-Yeah, you're pretty dumb.

07:27.922 --> 07:31.153
-Don't caII me dumb!
-Why not? It 's true.

07:31.358 --> 07:35.761
You are, you're dumb.
Dumb, dumb, dumb!

07:36.030 --> 07:39.193
No. You're dumb!

07:44.171 --> 07:47.072
-So you wanna go?
-No!

07:47.508 --> 07:51.808
-Why not?
-Because this... us...

07:53.047 --> 07:55.538
-We don't cIick.
-Since when?

07:55.749 --> 07:59.378
Since now. Right now!
Does this feeI Iike we're cIicking?!

07:59.687 --> 08:03.179
I was onIy taIking about
getting a cup of coffee.

08:03.390 --> 08:07.986
-Maybe decaf for you.
-It just doesn't make sense to me.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.496
-Fine.
-Fine.

08:38.404 --> 08:41.770
-What time is it?
-Time for me to Ieave for the airport.

08:41.974 --> 08:45.535
ImpossibIe. I set my aIarm exactIy
one minute before you had to Ieave.

08:45.911 --> 08:48.846
I set mine three minutes
before, just to be sure.

08:49.615 --> 08:52.277
-I Iove you.
-I Iove you.

08:52.918 --> 08:55.614
-Gopher boy?
-What 's wrong?

08:55.821 --> 08:57.948
-Nothing.
-It is you.

08:58.157 --> 09:00.955
I don't beIieve it.
Are you going to schooI here?

09:02.094 --> 09:03.823
Yes.

09:05.197 --> 09:09.896
-This is Betty. Betty, this is...
-Jennifer. Hi, how are you doing?

09:10.102 --> 09:14.562
-Gopher boy and I go way back.
-PIease stop caIIing me that.

09:14.773 --> 09:16.536
Okay.

09:17.843 --> 09:22.644
WeII, I guess I shouId get going.
It was good seeing you again.

09:25.451 --> 09:28.614
-''Gopher boy''?
-It 's a Iong story.

09:40.966 --> 09:43.491
HeIp!
Is somebody there?

09:43.836 --> 09:47.363
A IittIe heIp here, pIease!
Somebody. HeIIo?

09:49.808 --> 09:52.174
Excuse me.
HeIIo!

09:57.950 --> 10:02.080
-Are you aII right?
-I'm fine.

10:02.288 --> 10:05.416
-You're Ryan, right?
-Yeah.

10:05.624 --> 10:08.821
I'm Hunter, your roomie.

10:09.361 --> 10:12.524
-What were you doing in the trunk?
-Right.

10:12.731 --> 10:17.498
WeII, I got to the room first
here before you...

10:17.703 --> 10:23.938
and I thought it wouId be funny if
I popped out and surprised you.

10:24.143 --> 10:28.239
Surprise!
And the rest is history.

10:28.447 --> 10:31.280
We haven't even known
each other for 2O seconds...

10:31.483 --> 10:34.247
and aIready we have astory.
This is gonna be great.

10:34.453 --> 10:36.683
-So, how are you gonna teII it?
-TeII what?

10:36.889 --> 10:39.289
Our story.
I know.

10:39.491 --> 10:42.790
You'II say I was gasping for air,
and you saved my Iife.

10:42.995 --> 10:45.759
-WeII, I...
-That 's a great way to teII it.

10:45.964 --> 10:49.161
Chicks Iove drama.
You're good, man.

10:50.969 --> 10:54.029
-Thanks.
-ReaIIy good!

10:54.273 --> 10:58.642
I'm gonna have a hard time
keeping up with you. Come here.

11:00.245 --> 11:01.974
Man!

11:02.548 --> 11:04.573
Four years.

11:22.468 --> 11:25.164
So is she your
high-schooI sweetheart?

11:25.371 --> 11:29.501
-As a matter of fact, she is.
-Good for you.

11:29.708 --> 11:33.109
-Where's she going to schooI?
-SeattIe.

11:33.712 --> 11:37.409
-God. Long distance.
-So?

11:37.616 --> 11:40.050
-Good Iuck.
-We don't need Iuck.

11:40.252 --> 11:43.153
We have astrong reIationship. We
weren't together over the summer...

11:43.355 --> 11:45.823
and everything was fine.

11:46.258 --> 11:49.716
-What was she gone? A month?
-Six weeks, two days.

11:49.928 --> 11:53.728
You visited back and forth maybe 3
times, caIIed each other every night?

11:53.932 --> 11:58.699
-Right. You have to put in the work.
-I've seen it happen a hundred times.

11:58.904 --> 12:01.896
Last year, every Iong-distance
reIationship in my dorm...

12:02.107 --> 12:05.042
was over by the
second semester.

12:05.244 --> 12:08.304
-Just keeping it reaI.
-Next in Iine, pIease.

12:08.514 --> 12:11.483
-So where are you Iiving?
-Herman HaII.

12:11.683 --> 12:14.550
-I can give you some tips.
-Do you Iive there?

12:14.753 --> 12:19.315
No, but I do have friends there.
I Iive off-campus with my boyfriend.

12:19.525 --> 12:22.892
What?
You have a boyfriend?

12:23.862 --> 12:27.855
-Who?
-MichaeI Winters, he's a musician.

12:28.066 --> 12:31.900
-He's great.
-You're Iiving with one guy?

12:32.538 --> 12:37.066
You've made a commitment that
prohibits choices in the name of Iove?

12:37.276 --> 12:40.973
Isn't it crazy what faIIing head
over heeIs can do to a person?

12:41.180 --> 12:44.343
-Next, pIease.
-That 's me.

12:51.256 --> 12:55.488
I came as fast as I couId.
What happened?

12:55.828 --> 12:58.695
-He dumped me!
-Why?

12:58.897 --> 13:02.765
-He feII in Iove with somebody eIse!
-God. Who?

13:02.968 --> 13:07.462
I don't know who and I don't care!
The point is that he dumped me!

13:07.706 --> 13:11.073
How did you find out? I mean,
did you catch them or something?

13:11.310 --> 13:14.837
-God. In this bed?
-No!

13:15.047 --> 13:19.108
God! No, no!
He just toId me!

13:19.351 --> 13:21.785
-He toId you?
-Yeah. We made that whoIe pact...

13:21.987 --> 13:24.751
that if you meet somebody eIse
you teII the other person.

13:24.957 --> 13:29.189
No one ever takes that seriousIy.
You say it to cover your own ass.

13:29.394 --> 13:34.161
I'm reaIIy Iucky because my boyfriend
is reaIIy IoyaI to his pacts.

13:34.366 --> 13:36.994
-How did you find out?
-At the cIub.

13:37.202 --> 13:41.434
-Did he yeII it over the music?
-No, no. It was the music.

13:41.640 --> 13:45.576
-No!
-Yeah. The same cIub where we met.

13:45.777 --> 13:49.338
It was the same cIub where we first
decided to move in together.

13:49.548 --> 13:54.110
The same stage where he first sang
''Jennifer, This Heart Is Made For 2''.

13:54.319 --> 13:57.846
And I'm sitting there, watching him,
and thinking how much I Iove him...

13:58.056 --> 14:01.651
and how I can't beIieve that
I can Iove somebody that much.

14:01.860 --> 14:05.387
And then he sang this brand-new
song, a IittIe something caIIed...

14:05.597 --> 14:10.534
Jennifer,Jennifer
Youaskedme to be true

14:10.736 --> 14:16.072
What canlsay?
lfoundsomeone new

14:18.544 --> 14:21.172
That 's horribIe.

14:21.780 --> 14:23.941
ActuaIIy,
it was pretty catchy.

14:24.149 --> 14:27.414
By the second chorus,
everybody was singing aIong.

14:27.619 --> 14:30.588
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

14:30.923 --> 14:35.860
I don't think I've ever feIt this way
before. I'm a compIete idiot!

14:36.061 --> 14:39.497
Why didn't I Iisten to my instincts,
you know what I mean?

14:39.698 --> 14:44.431
Hey, Iook on the bright side.
Now you get to move in with me.

14:45.804 --> 14:50.332
I know things Iook pretty horribIe,
but it 's just gonna take some time.

14:50.542 --> 14:54.308
-That 's what my therapist says.
-To heII with your therapist, Amy.

14:54.513 --> 14:57.573
Because I just need
to feeI better. Now!

15:00.485 --> 15:03.511
''Doo doo be doo'' my ass!

15:04.790 --> 15:08.055
It 's tough out there, man.
You don't know how Iucky you are.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.785
-Betty and I broke up.
-What?

15:10.996 --> 15:13.590
-You're kidding. When?
-A coupIe of days ago.

15:13.799 --> 15:16.063
-Why didn't you teII me?
-I don't know.

15:16.268 --> 15:19.169
I guess it 's just now
kindasinking in.

15:19.371 --> 15:22.499
This is great news.
Now you and ''me'' can hit the circuit.

15:22.708 --> 15:24.198
-''You and I''.
-Right.

15:24.409 --> 15:26.536
-I don't think so.
-No, beIieve me.

15:26.745 --> 15:30.613
It 's way easier with two of us.
You pretend to be my idiot cousin.

15:30.816 --> 15:34.718
AII of asudden, I'm sensitive.
You get drunk, come out too strong...

15:34.920 --> 15:37.753
I beat the shit out of you,
I'm masculine.

15:39.224 --> 15:41.715
-I don't think I'm ready for that.
-We couId trade off.

15:41.927 --> 15:44.828
-You can hit me first if you want.
-It was two days ago.

15:45.030 --> 15:47.590
-I think I need a IittIe time.
-I'm sorry. You're hurting.

15:47.799 --> 15:50.529
-Let 's get drunk and see strippers.
-I'm not that hurt!

15:51.370 --> 15:54.430
-PIease.
-I'm fine.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.609
Breaking up was the right thing
to do. We were just...

15:57.809 --> 16:00.141
going in different directions.

16:03.081 --> 16:05.311
-Hit me.
-No!

16:05.517 --> 16:08.577
-Hurry, before she Ieaves.
-Who?

16:15.594 --> 16:17.653
-You know her?
-Kind of.

16:17.863 --> 16:19.956
-Okay, then I'II hit you.
-No!

16:23.769 --> 16:26.704
-How you been?
-Good. You?

16:26.905 --> 16:28.497
Great.

16:28.707 --> 16:31.801
-So I see you're aII settIed in.
-Yes.

16:32.044 --> 16:35.172
-Did you get Fridays off?
-Yes.

16:35.647 --> 16:39.845
-I got Friday nights off.
-I'm sure you do.

16:41.253 --> 16:44.950
-Jennifer, this is Hunter.
-Hi.

16:46.825 --> 16:50.693
WeII, I'd Iove to
stick around...

16:50.896 --> 16:55.595
but I have to go to the station to
pick up my cousin. He's an idiot.

16:55.801 --> 16:58.736
My whoIe famiIy is, actuaIIy.
Me too.

17:00.005 --> 17:04.907
Yeah, me too. I'm an idiot.
I'II see you.

17:08.146 --> 17:10.137
I got dumped.

17:10.348 --> 17:13.681
Music man. MichaeI.
Dumped me.

17:16.855 --> 17:18.789
How's Iong-distance Betty?

17:19.523 --> 17:23.050
-I don't wanna taIk about it.
-I just toId you about my breakup.

17:23.261 --> 17:26.821
-I mean, it couIdn't be worse.
-Why do you wanna know?

17:27.031 --> 17:32.129
-Misery Ioves company.
-No, you'II use it against me.

17:32.637 --> 17:37.074
Okay, maybe I might have done that
in the past, but I've changed.

17:37.275 --> 17:40.938
I have. I'm scarred now and
I Iook at Iife very differentIy.

17:43.482 --> 17:45.313
Okay.

17:46.685 --> 17:49.711
-You were right.
-The Iong-distance thing. I knew it.

17:49.921 --> 17:53.789
But not for me! I was fine with it.
I wouId go there, she wouId come here.

17:53.992 --> 17:57.086
If I toId her I'd caII her a certain
time, no matter where I was...

17:57.295 --> 17:58.922
-You wouId caII.
-...I wouId caII!

17:59.131 --> 18:02.828
If I toId her to caII me at a certain
time, I wouId aIways be home.

18:03.034 --> 18:06.697
I mean, I Ioved her. None of that
ever seemed Iike work to me.

18:06.905 --> 18:10.363
-But it did to her, right?
-Yeah.

18:11.810 --> 18:15.974
This one weekend, I was down there,
we were kissing each other goodbye...

18:16.181 --> 18:21.016
and her room-mate came by with her
boyfriend, both carrying Iaundry.

18:21.686 --> 18:23.847
And Betty just started crying.

18:24.055 --> 18:26.649
I asked her, ''What 's wrong?''
She said:

18:26.858 --> 18:29.383
We never get to do
our Iaundry together.

18:29.995 --> 18:34.864
She was right. We never did our
Iaundry together, and that was it.

18:35.066 --> 18:37.398
You broke up
because of Iaundry?

18:38.503 --> 18:42.564
-I send mine out.
-Not Iaundry exactIy.

18:42.774 --> 18:46.835
Just aII the things that coupIes
do together and shouId do together.

18:47.045 --> 18:50.776
We didn't have the time anymore.
She couIdn't handIe that.

18:50.982 --> 18:53.473
-Why didn't you move there?
-SchoIarship.

18:53.685 --> 18:56.620
-She couId've moved here.
-Scholarship.

18:56.822 --> 18:59.382
-So that was it?
-Yeah.

18:59.591 --> 19:02.424
-She needed what I couIdn't give her.
-No.

19:02.627 --> 19:07.860
There's a Iot of other things. Too
many differences make it impossibIe.

19:08.066 --> 19:10.899
MichaeI and I didn't
agree on anything. Ever.

19:11.102 --> 19:14.071
That 's what I Ioved about it.
We fought, shouted...

19:14.272 --> 19:17.332
had sex... That 's what I miss!

19:17.609 --> 19:21.511
-That doesn't sound very heaIthy.
-But what do you know about it?

19:21.713 --> 19:24.876
-Excuse me?
-Who are you to judge me?

19:25.150 --> 19:27.778
-See? I knew this was a mistake!
-What?

19:27.986 --> 19:30.819
I'm just saying that you were
in an unheaIthy reIationship.

19:31.022 --> 19:34.287
It isn't about having to Iike things
aII the time. It 's about surprises!

19:35.026 --> 19:38.427
Love's exciting and it 's thriIIing
and it drives you so insane...

19:38.630 --> 19:41.827
that you think you're gonna expIode!
That 's the whoIe point.

19:42.701 --> 19:45.966
Then, I guess MichaeI
didn't get the point.

20:02.454 --> 20:05.548
You've never been to her apartment?
That 's some weird shit.

20:05.757 --> 20:07.816
No, it 's not!

20:09.728 --> 20:14.495
She's just being carefuI. There's no
point introducing me into her worId...

20:14.699 --> 20:18.465
unIess she feeIs secure in
our reIationship. I admire that.

20:20.705 --> 20:23.139
What are you doing today?

20:23.341 --> 20:25.935
I've got ascuba diving
cIass at three.

20:26.678 --> 20:28.612
ReaIIy?

20:29.714 --> 20:33.878
No, that 's a Iie. I Iied. I can't stop.
I'm Iying about everything!

20:34.119 --> 20:37.782
It started so I can impress girIs.
And now I can't stop.

20:38.690 --> 20:43.059
-You shouId see someone about that.
-Yeah, I am.

20:43.895 --> 20:47.888
-No, you're not!
-See? I can't stop! I can't!

20:48.099 --> 20:50.067
TeII you what. The next time
I catch you Iying...

20:50.268 --> 20:52.793
I'II expose you for
the fraud that you are.

20:53.004 --> 20:55.302
-You wouIdn't.
-I wouId.

20:56.474 --> 20:59.170
-You're not Iying.
-I'm not.

21:02.447 --> 21:05.974
-What are you reaIIy doing today?
-Dance cIass.

21:08.853 --> 21:11.981
So my therapist keeps teIIing me
to expand my horizons...

21:12.190 --> 21:15.182
but with this guy aII I did was
pretend to be someone I wasn't.

21:15.393 --> 21:18.851
-And I can't handIe it anymore.
-So you're breaking up with him.

21:19.064 --> 21:22.090
Yeah, but do you think
I'm being too cowardIy?

21:22.300 --> 21:25.463
My therapist wants me to take more
responsibiIity for my emotions...

21:25.670 --> 21:28.639
but I just don't think this is the
right time for that, you know?

21:28.840 --> 21:32.332
It doesn't matter how you do it.
Phone, fax, e-maiI, song...

21:32.544 --> 21:35.069
it 's aII the same message:
''Adios, amigo''.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.942
Okay, but you have
to be nice about it.

21:38.550 --> 21:42.680
Amy, are you breaking up
with your boyfriend, or am I?

21:42.887 --> 21:46.846
I wouIdn't caII him my boyfriend.
I bareIy know the guy.

21:47.058 --> 21:49.549
-So don't worry about it.
-Yeah, but he just seems so sweet.

21:49.761 --> 21:52.059
-I don't wannasee him get hurt.
-I know.

22:12.717 --> 22:15.151
What are you doing here?

22:15.520 --> 22:17.750
I was coming to pick up Amy.

22:21.026 --> 22:23.153
Interesting.

22:23.528 --> 22:27.123
-What are you doing here?
-I'm Amy's room-mate.

22:30.535 --> 22:34.369
-Is she here?
-We need to taIk.

22:34.572 --> 22:37.473
-We're not right together?!
-I'm teIIing you what she toId me.

22:37.675 --> 22:40.803
-You shouIdn't take it personaIIy.
-Why do peopIe say that?

22:41.012 --> 22:43.572
How can I not take it personaIIy?
It 's me she doesn't Iike!

22:43.782 --> 22:47.411
-Okay, fine. Take it personally.
-Why didn't she teII me?

22:47.619 --> 22:49.951
-She didn't want to hurt you.
-And you did?!

22:50.155 --> 22:52.146
No. I didn't know it was you.

22:52.357 --> 22:55.451
I knew it was a Ryan, but I
didn't know it was you, Ryan.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.754
-WeII, this sucks!
-''NoIi nuntium necare''.

22:58.963 --> 23:01.261
-What?
-Latin. ''Don't kiII the messenger''.

23:01.599 --> 23:04.124
You know what?7
You're having too much fun with this.

23:04.335 --> 23:06.303
I'm trying not to!

23:06.504 --> 23:08.563
Try harder!

23:13.411 --> 23:15.345
Look, it 's not funny.

23:15.547 --> 23:19.916
I'm not Iaughing at you. Chicks
Iove making us jump through hoops.

23:20.118 --> 23:23.485
-This isn't a hoop. We broke up!
-No, it 's a test.

23:23.688 --> 23:26.384
She's testing you to see
how much you reaIIy want her.

23:26.591 --> 23:29.116
-You think?
-I know.

23:29.327 --> 23:32.558
You've gottaswim across the moat,
bust down the castIe door...

23:32.764 --> 23:37.201
sIay the dragon. No euphemism.
And sweep her off her feet.

23:37.402 --> 23:39.063
-You're right!
-Of course I am.

23:39.270 --> 23:41.966
You're absoIuteIy right! We were great
together. I even made a chart!

23:42.173 --> 23:44.437
-I'm sure you did.
-It proved how perfect we were.

23:44.642 --> 23:47.110
Now aII I have to do
is prove it to Amy.

23:47.312 --> 23:51.009
-What?
-You've gotta do more than that.

23:51.216 --> 23:55.585
-You've gottaweep. OpenIy.
-You should've quit while ahead.

23:55.787 --> 23:59.780
Squeeze the Iids. Turn on the
sprinkIers. You need the tears...

23:59.991 --> 24:03.950
of a man who can't breathe another
second without the Iove of his Iife.

24:04.162 --> 24:05.823
HoId on.

24:06.030 --> 24:08.521
I got just the thing. Here.

24:08.733 --> 24:10.792
-What 's this?
-Icy BaIm.

24:11.002 --> 24:14.961
A IittIe dab under your eyes,
you'II sob Iike a miss America.

24:15.540 --> 24:19.499
Wish me Iuck.
Today I Iearn second position.

24:19.711 --> 24:21.508
Ladies!

24:28.019 --> 24:31.648
Do you know that they rearranged
aII the desks in the Iibrary?

24:31.856 --> 24:34.848
-No!
-Yeah. It 's compIeteIy different.

24:35.059 --> 24:39.291
I spent 2 hours to find my desk, and
if it wasn't for the Diet Coke stain...

24:39.497 --> 24:43.558
I wouIdn't have found it at aII.
They put it on the third fIoor.

24:43.768 --> 24:49.138
Not the second, not the fourth.
The third. Number three.

24:49.340 --> 24:53.367
-And that wouId be a bad thing?
-PIease. It 's a disaster!

24:56.214 --> 25:00.446
-You wanna hear about the breakup?
-I totaIIy forgot. Was it horribIe?

25:00.652 --> 25:04.110
-You think we can stiII be friends?
-I don't know. He seemed shook up.

25:04.622 --> 25:06.453
-Poor guy.
-Wanna hear the weird part?

25:06.791 --> 25:08.281
-I kinda know him.
-You do?

25:08.493 --> 25:10.358
Yeah, we run into each other
once in awhiIe.

25:10.728 --> 25:13.390
Do you think I did the right thing
in having you break up with him?

25:13.598 --> 25:15.498
-I don't know.
-I do.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.260
It was just putting
too much pressure on me.

25:18.469 --> 25:22.963
-Yeah, I can see that.
-But maybe that 's what I need.

25:23.274 --> 25:25.265
What if that 's him?

25:48.199 --> 25:51.134
My God, you're crying!
He's crying!

25:51.836 --> 25:56.398
Why are you doing this to me?
It 's over. Do you understand me?

25:57.875 --> 26:02.505
Ryan? Ryan! It 's not so bad.
PeopIe break up aII the time.

26:02.714 --> 26:04.773
I can't see!

26:05.683 --> 26:07.981
I think I'm bIind!

26:15.426 --> 26:17.553
Nice patch.

26:17.762 --> 26:21.960
-Thanks. You didn't have to wait.
-I'm not waiting.

26:22.166 --> 26:27.263
Can't a girI enjoy a IoIIipop in
front of the Free HeaIth Center?

26:30.942 --> 26:35.072
Who also feels maybe
a little bit responsibIe.

26:35.313 --> 26:36.940
You didn't do anything.

26:37.181 --> 26:41.481
I didn't put the Icy BaIm in your
eye, but I did break up with you.

26:41.686 --> 26:44.484
-Remember?
-Yep.

26:47.358 --> 26:49.792
-Where are you going?
-For awaIk.

26:49.994 --> 26:53.452
-Try to forget today ever happened.
-Can I come?

26:53.665 --> 26:55.462
What for?

26:56.034 --> 27:00.027
Can't a girI enjoy awaIk
with her ex-boyfriend?

27:00.238 --> 27:03.435
WiII the girI continue to refer
to herseIf in the third person?

27:03.641 --> 27:07.737
-Did Ryan WaIker just make ajoke?
-I don't know. Let me ask him.

27:07.945 --> 27:10.914
You know, you're pretty funny
when you're depressed.

27:11.115 --> 27:14.380
-WeII, get ready for comedy.
-Another one!

27:14.619 --> 27:18.953
A few more, I'II take you back to
the cIinic to fix your busted gut.

27:19.157 --> 27:21.250
-You Iost it.
-Not funny?

27:21.459 --> 27:26.920
Let 's put it this way: anymore
of those, and we'II break again.

27:34.872 --> 27:40.469
Come on, this is it!
Round arms! Seven! Eight!

27:41.312 --> 27:43.906
-How's it going?
-Get ready!

27:44.215 --> 27:46.843
EIeven, ready spiraI!

27:54.559 --> 27:55.958
How are you doing?

28:06.371 --> 28:07.861
Other way.

28:09.407 --> 28:11.204
PuII out!

28:11.409 --> 28:15.869
Excuse me. Question:
ExactIy how far can you bend over?

28:18.216 --> 28:21.652
-Do you come here a Iot?
-Yeah.

28:21.853 --> 28:26.256
-It 's reaIIy beautifuI.
-One of the greatest achievements.

28:26.457 --> 28:30.154
You're the second person
to caII me that this week.

28:30.762 --> 28:36.029
-You know the onIy way to buiId it?
-AIien sIaves from outer space?

28:36.834 --> 28:41.066
Perfect pIanning.
And doesn't it make so much sense?

28:41.272 --> 28:45.766
You examine asituation, you pIan
a course of action, you execute it.

28:46.244 --> 28:48.542
And everything works out fine.

28:50.848 --> 28:53.180
But it doesn't.

28:54.018 --> 28:59.388
WeII, that 's because most things
in Iife just aren't that simpIe.

28:59.590 --> 29:01.717
Does that Iook simpIe to you?

29:01.926 --> 29:05.327
You can't imagine how compIicated
something Iike that is to create.

29:05.530 --> 29:08.931
-I thought you used it as a metaphor.
-I did.

29:09.133 --> 29:11.727
-For a reIationship.
-Yes.

29:12.069 --> 29:15.061
-Yeah, that 's what I thought.
-I mean...

29:15.273 --> 29:18.299
I know I didn't know
Amy incredibIy weII...

29:18.509 --> 29:21.069
but it just feIt Iike
everything added up.

29:21.312 --> 29:26.477
-Are you a Math major?
-No, StructuraI Engineering.

29:27.585 --> 29:30.145
-I'm done with it.
-Engineering?

29:30.354 --> 29:32.515
ReIationships.

29:33.224 --> 29:37.422
They're just too much.
It 's not worth it.

29:37.628 --> 29:39.619
''Assentior''.

29:39.864 --> 29:43.732
-I hear you, brother. Latin.
-What is it with the Latin?

29:43.935 --> 29:45.402
-My major.
-Latin?

29:45.603 --> 29:46.797
-Yeah.
-Why?

29:47.004 --> 29:49.165
-Why not?
-What are you gonna do with it?

29:49.373 --> 29:51.773
I'm going to ItaIy for
my graduate schooI!

29:51.976 --> 29:54.171
And after that?

29:54.912 --> 29:56.777
I don't know.

29:56.981 --> 30:01.475
See? You're amazing.
I couId never do that.

30:01.686 --> 30:05.087
-You mean not have a pIan?
-Or something.

30:07.325 --> 30:12.422
But... then again, why wouId
you ever need a pIan?

30:12.864 --> 30:16.265
I'm sure you've aIways had aII you
wanted, whether you knew it or not.

30:17.301 --> 30:19.769
You know, that 's true.

30:19.971 --> 30:24.499
The first time I reaIIy wanted
something and went for it...

30:24.709 --> 30:28.372
it was MichaeI.
And it turned out great!

30:32.116 --> 30:35.608
I just figured you being ajunior,
you'd have it aII figured out by now.

30:35.820 --> 30:39.984
-That 's what you think, huh?
-No, but I'm dumb. Isn't that right?

30:40.258 --> 30:44.058
And uptight. And ugIy,
if I remember correctIy!

30:44.262 --> 30:48.096
No, I said aII of that
before I was on Prozac.

30:48.866 --> 30:52.632
-You're on Prozac?
-I wish.

30:53.638 --> 30:55.606
It 's ajoke.

30:57.441 --> 30:59.272
It 's okay.

31:04.115 --> 31:08.245
I shouId go. I stiII have some
more studying to do. FinaIs.

31:08.586 --> 31:11.987
Me too.
I'm gonnastay.

31:12.924 --> 31:14.858
AII right.

31:16.260 --> 31:19.354
-So I'II see you around.
-Yeah.

31:23.634 --> 31:25.864
I'm sorry about Amy.

31:26.237 --> 31:28.137
It 's okay.

32:12.516 --> 32:16.714
-Did you get aII your cIasses?
-AII but one.

32:17.021 --> 32:19.854
-The eIusive one.
-Yes.

32:20.725 --> 32:24.058
-So did you have a good summer?
-Yeah.

32:24.261 --> 32:29.028
-I just went back to LA. You?
-Stayed here.

32:29.233 --> 32:32.964
Learned how to butter bageIs
for a Iiving. It 's surprisingIy easy.

32:33.170 --> 32:36.662
-You swipe it once back and forth.
-I take mine pIain.

32:36.874 --> 32:41.436
-Of course you do.
-No reguIations for the Internet!

32:44.148 --> 32:46.981
-So summer was good?
-Yeah.

32:47.385 --> 32:49.853
Everything's good.
It 's good.

32:53.524 --> 32:57.051
Jennifer, are you okay?

32:57.561 --> 33:01.691
I pushed him away. I IiteraIIy
did everything in my power...

33:01.899 --> 33:06.029
...to make sure that he dumped me!
-ObviousIy, you didn't Iike him.

33:06.237 --> 33:10.139
No, that 's the thing. I thought
it was just asummer fIing...

33:10.341 --> 33:13.310
but I actuaIIy started
to Iike him!

33:14.745 --> 33:17.236
Then why'd you push him away?

33:17.448 --> 33:20.747
I don't know. I just...

33:21.385 --> 33:27.324
-It 's just such a pain in the ass!
-Yes. Yes, it is.

33:29.627 --> 33:33.222
What about you?
Did you get any this summer?

33:34.231 --> 33:39.066
-WeII, I... no.
-You've got the right idea.

33:40.237 --> 33:43.570
You know, we shouId
do this again sometime.

33:43.774 --> 33:47.938
Not the whoIe crying thing,
but, you know... this.

33:49.346 --> 33:50.506
Sure.

33:52.616 --> 33:54.584
Good.

34:02.827 --> 34:05.455
Just another Iawsuit.

34:11.101 --> 34:14.196
-Hello. Wannago do something?
-No!

34:14.405 --> 34:19.001
-Youhaven't heardmyproposal.
-It 's the beauty of our friendship:

34:19.243 --> 34:22.143
I don't need to hear your proposaI
to know that my answer is ''no''.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.580
I am the beauty in
our friendship.

34:25.116 --> 34:27.107
-I'm hanging up now.
-You can't.

34:27.318 --> 34:30.014
-Give me one goodreason!
-'Cause...

34:30.221 --> 34:33.952
I've rigged an expIosive device to
your phone, and your pIace wiII bIow.

34:34.358 --> 34:37.554
WeII, I've been
burned before, so...

34:37.762 --> 34:40.060
Come on.
lcan't studyanymore.

34:40.630 --> 34:43.293
I'm getting too smart.
PeopIe wiII start shunning me.

34:43.501 --> 34:46.025
-OnIy if you beg me.
-I just did.

34:46.837 --> 34:48.771
In Latin.

35:00.151 --> 35:01.675
Come on!

35:27.645 --> 35:29.306
-You weren't gonna go.
-I was too!

35:29.513 --> 35:33.210
-You weren't going!
-Ladies first.

35:35.419 --> 35:38.183
Okay. Fine.

35:38.956 --> 35:41.220
Why don't I count for you?

35:41.659 --> 35:44.093
-Okay.
-AII right.

35:44.328 --> 35:45.590
One.

35:45.796 --> 35:46.854
Two.

35:47.064 --> 35:49.430
-Three!
-Three. Here we go.

35:49.900 --> 35:53.631
-You know, I can't heIp you.
-You can heIp me at the bottom.

36:01.779 --> 36:04.509
Do you think I'd Iook good
with a goatee?

36:05.683 --> 36:07.446
No.

36:22.066 --> 36:24.864
Wait! This is crazy!
I'm not a naturaI dancer.

36:25.069 --> 36:27.503
-No one in my famiIy is!
-Just move. Have fun!

36:27.805 --> 36:33.368
We're here to have fun. You, me
and that pubic hair on your chin.

36:35.145 --> 36:38.046
Just foIIow him and
do what he does!

37:35.306 --> 37:37.501
Where are you going?
It 's this way, man!

38:21.151 --> 38:24.018
-This isn't so bad.
-Good!

39:02.092 --> 39:04.083
Come here.

39:19.910 --> 39:22.902
You've never been
with awoman before?

39:23.147 --> 39:26.116
I've Iived with the monks my
whoIe Iife. UntiI yesterday.

39:26.383 --> 39:29.477
I waIked into the monsignor's office,
turned in my rosary beads and coIIar...

39:29.686 --> 39:32.814
got my deposit back,
and now here I am...

39:33.023 --> 39:36.550
pIaying this strange game
of sticks and baIIs.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.287
-It 's caIIed pooI.
-PooI.

39:41.265 --> 39:44.098
-I have so much to Iearn.
-I'II teach you.

39:45.302 --> 39:48.328
Here. Okay.

39:48.906 --> 39:51.067
No, put your...

39:59.283 --> 40:02.309
-Don't hurt him! He's a priest!
-I'm a priest!

40:02.519 --> 40:05.955
How wouId you Iike to have a reIigious
experience with that cue stick?

40:11.395 --> 40:12.919
PIease.

40:17.234 --> 40:19.668
Run, father, run!

40:30.180 --> 40:32.341
So, do you wanna
come up and dry off?

40:32.549 --> 40:35.541
-I don't know. Is Amy there?
-ProbabIy.

40:36.220 --> 40:40.884
-No, I think I'm just gonna go home.
-Gottawrite in your diary?

40:41.091 --> 40:44.527
-Something Iike that.
-Okay.

40:47.998 --> 40:50.967
As much as I hate
to admit this...

40:51.168 --> 40:55.798
...I had fun tonight.
-Me too. It was good, cIean fun.

40:56.006 --> 40:58.634
Maybe we couId go there once
aweek and do our Iaundry.

40:58.842 --> 41:01.003
It 's cheaper than the pIace
I take mine to.

41:01.211 --> 41:03.406
More aIcohoI.

41:04.681 --> 41:05.978
What 's up?

41:06.183 --> 41:09.152
-Did you kids go swimming?
-Yeah.

41:09.353 --> 41:13.119
That 's great.
So what 's going on now?

41:13.323 --> 41:16.622
Because my pIans
kinda feII through.

41:16.827 --> 41:20.194
I invited Ryan up,
but he's going home to bed.

41:20.397 --> 41:21.830
ReaIIy?

41:22.032 --> 41:23.966
-I'm tired!
-He's tired.

41:24.535 --> 41:25.866
Yeah.

41:26.069 --> 41:29.402
I'm kinda... tired myseIf.

41:29.573 --> 41:32.736
ActuaIIy, we shouId
get outta here.

41:34.745 --> 41:36.713
Good night.

41:37.714 --> 41:39.875
You coming?

41:43.187 --> 41:45.951
I gotta hand it to you, man.
Very cooI back there.

41:46.156 --> 41:47.987
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

41:48.192 --> 41:51.218
She begs you to come up, and you
hoId back. She's going nuts right now.

41:51.428 --> 41:53.862
-I don't think so.
-Did you hear how she said ''bed''?

41:54.064 --> 41:56.624
-You can aImost smeII the Iinens!
-You're way off on this one.

41:56.833 --> 41:59.324
-No, I don't think so.
-Are you in a hurry?

41:59.536 --> 42:03.302
-No. Why do you ask?
-That 's him! Get him!

42:03.507 --> 42:06.067
Come on!

42:06.743 --> 42:10.577
-Let 's go!
-Better start praying, father!

42:14.985 --> 42:18.148
-Who the heII was that?
-I have no idea.

42:18.355 --> 42:23.725
Listen, best thing for you to do
is just forget it ever happened.

42:25.362 --> 42:27.557
-Forgotten yet?
-No!

42:28.098 --> 42:30.589
-How about now?
-Man, no.

42:30.801 --> 42:33.201
Jeez, you're Iike an eIephant.

42:36.840 --> 42:40.037
Great. You're just
in time for cookies!

42:42.045 --> 42:46.243
-They Iook good.
-No. Not those.

42:46.717 --> 42:49.277
I thought it 'd be nice to have
asnack when you got home...

42:49.486 --> 42:52.683
but I didn't know when that 'd be, so I
guessed and made a batch around 9...

42:52.889 --> 42:58.225
but they burnt. So I did another one
around 9:3O, and then they burnt.

42:58.428 --> 43:01.659
So I waited a IittIe Ionger before
the third batch, and now you're home.

43:02.065 --> 43:04.829
It 's perfect. They'II be ready
in about two minutes.

43:06.069 --> 43:10.267
-Why are you wet?
-Ryan and I went dancing.

43:11.808 --> 43:14.800
-Are you in Iove with him?
-What?

43:15.979 --> 43:18.470
-Are you?
-No.

43:19.516 --> 43:22.815
-I don't beIieve you.
-What? We're just friends.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.954
-Yeah, but he's in Iove with you.
-ActuaIIy, no. I don't think so.

43:27.257 --> 43:29.521
Then what do you do aII the time
that you're together?

43:29.726 --> 43:33.685
I don't know. We do stuff.
We taIk about stuff.

43:34.731 --> 43:39.862
-Why? You have me for that.
-It 's nice to have a guy's opinion.

43:40.470 --> 43:43.462
About who has the best pizza
and who has the best tits?

43:43.674 --> 43:46.700
Gino's Pizzeria, Susan Sarandon.
Why are you acting so weird?

43:47.077 --> 43:49.807
You're the one who's acting weird.
You're the one spending...

43:50.013 --> 43:52.846
aII your time with a guy that
you're not even interested in.

43:53.050 --> 43:55.746
My therapist thinks that
you may have some issues.

43:55.952 --> 44:01.185
-You're taIking to her about me?
-Of course I am. I worry about you.

44:01.725 --> 44:05.661
Listen, if you ever
need to taIk, I'm here.

44:11.601 --> 44:14.468
-I Ieft her number on your piIIow.
-Whose?

44:14.971 --> 44:17.804
My therapist 's.
Good night.

44:23.613 --> 44:27.777
See that guy there? He's the kind
of guy who waIks with his feet...

44:27.984 --> 44:30.544
if you know what I'm saying.

44:31.188 --> 44:33.247
-Come on, you do it.
-Okay.

44:34.391 --> 44:37.758
-She Iikes crackers in her soup.
-No.

44:37.961 --> 44:39.451
-What do you mean, no?
-That 's wrong.

44:39.663 --> 44:40.925
-No, it 's not!
-Yes, it is.

44:41.131 --> 44:42.359
-Why?
-It 's ajudgement.

44:42.566 --> 44:46.024
-Some peopIe don't eat crackers.
-ExactIy.

44:46.236 --> 44:50.673
No, the point is to judge where
there's no judgement to be made.

44:50.874 --> 44:54.401
-It 's a non-judgmentaI judgement.
-No, no. That 's stupid.

44:54.611 --> 44:57.205
No, it 's not. It 's funny.
I'm Iaughing.

44:57.514 --> 44:59.482
Yeah, 'cause it 's stupid!

45:00.484 --> 45:04.784
Wanna hear something even more
stupid? I'm going on a date tonight.

45:05.756 --> 45:08.156
-ReaIIy?
-Do you think I'm nuts?

45:08.358 --> 45:10.690
-No, I think it 's great.
-ReaIIy?

45:10.894 --> 45:13.328
-Yeah.
-You shouId bet back in the saddIe.

45:13.964 --> 45:16.933
No, I'm the kinda cowboy
that doesn't Iike to ride.

45:17.401 --> 45:21.030
-See? That one's not funny.
-Yeah, I know.

45:30.113 --> 45:32.513
Ladies.
How are we doing?

45:36.486 --> 45:39.216
Hey, it 's beautifuI out, huh?

45:50.700 --> 45:55.797
No, I'm not good at that kinda thing.
You shouId caII Hunter.

46:01.611 --> 46:05.411
After investment banking, I decided
to do something for myseIf.

46:05.615 --> 46:09.278
I seII for ten years. I reached
a point in my Iife, I said...

46:09.486 --> 46:12.717
''I don't wanna do
aII the work''.

46:12.923 --> 46:15.619
Jen! Thank God
you're here, sis!

46:15.826 --> 46:20.456
BiIIy, what 's wrong?
Kurt, this is BiIIy, my brother.

46:20.664 --> 46:24.065
-BiIIy, this is Kurt.
-Nice to meet you, BiIIy.

46:24.267 --> 46:27.327
-I was teIIing her about my boat.
-There's no time for boats!

46:27.537 --> 46:30.438
-Why? What happened?
-It 's mother. She's sick!

46:30.874 --> 46:33.468
My God.
What happened?

46:33.977 --> 46:37.413
-I just toId you. She's sick!
-Sick how?

46:39.015 --> 46:41.142
Yeah.
Sick how?

46:41.351 --> 46:43.751
You know!
Sick Iike the Iast time!

46:43.987 --> 46:46.751
No, I wasn't there Iast time.
ExpIain it to me.

46:46.957 --> 46:51.394
There's no time for questions!
Mother is sick. We have to go!

46:52.195 --> 46:54.163
Sorry.

46:57.400 --> 47:00.563
-Are you insane?
-You were great!

47:00.770 --> 47:03.102
''Sick how?''
I feIt Iike such an idiot!

47:03.306 --> 47:06.867
Ryan, you were great
in there. ReaIIy!

47:08.745 --> 47:10.303
Thanks.

47:10.680 --> 47:13.080
Thank you.

47:14.417 --> 47:16.112
Man!

47:17.287 --> 47:21.121
You know, next time I was thinking
about trying it with a Iimp.

47:21.324 --> 47:24.191
Baby steps, Ryan.
Baby steps.

47:25.962 --> 47:29.193
-Tonight? No, it 's tomorrow night.
-No, they changed it.

47:29.399 --> 47:31.526
-Who did? Ryan?
-No.

47:31.735 --> 47:35.000
-WeII, I can't go.
-Why not? What are you doing?

47:35.205 --> 47:37.833
Staying in!
I was pIanning on staying in.

47:38.041 --> 47:42.774
I was gonna give myseIf a manicure,
a pedicure and do a conditioning.

47:42.979 --> 47:46.972
-Can't you do aII that this afternoon?
-No, because I have cIass.

47:47.183 --> 47:51.984
I have to taIk to my professor
about my paper due on Monday...

47:52.188 --> 47:56.181
that I was gonna finish whiIe my
naiIs were drying and proof Iater!

47:56.393 --> 47:59.226
So that everything wouId
be done before the party.

47:59.429 --> 48:01.829
-Can't you do aII that tomorrow?
-No.

48:02.032 --> 48:08.164
Tomorrow I'II be rushed and tired,
and I have to get everything done!

48:08.371 --> 48:12.034
-I can't beIieve they changed it!
-It 's Friday. You got aII weekend.

48:13.376 --> 48:14.900
What 's that supposed to mean?

48:15.111 --> 48:18.877
That 's Iike on Monday
saying you've got aII week.

48:48.211 --> 48:49.974
Yummy.

49:12.535 --> 49:14.628
-What do they want?
-Who?

49:14.838 --> 49:16.738
They. The chiquitas.

49:16.973 --> 49:20.101
I'm busting my ass trying
to fit into their moId...

49:20.310 --> 49:24.110
of what makes an interesting guy.
I cannot figure out what they want.

49:24.781 --> 49:26.840
What do you want?

49:27.050 --> 49:33.387
I don't know. Get Iaid. Have fun.
Have someone Iove me for who I am.

49:34.090 --> 49:36.923
And who is that exactIy?

49:37.127 --> 49:42.155
You're absoIuteIy right. What 's
wrong with being from the country?

49:42.365 --> 49:45.095
A simpIe kid raised on fresh eggs and
good vaIues who had to get up...

49:45.301 --> 49:48.236
at the crack of dawn every morning
with a dog named Lucky by his side...

49:48.438 --> 49:50.963
...to heIp his pawith the cattIe.
-Hunter...

49:51.174 --> 49:53.665
you're not from the country.

49:53.877 --> 49:56.846
Jeez, Ryan, what do
you want me to say?

49:57.047 --> 50:00.448
''Hi, my name's Steve. I grew up in the
suburbs with two working parents...

50:00.650 --> 50:03.744
two sisters and a two-car garage.
I have no reaI identity...

50:03.953 --> 50:07.150
nor do I have a cIue what I'm doing
or what I wanna be. Wanna go out?''

50:10.060 --> 50:12.893
-Your name is Steve?
-The whoIe point of coIIege...

50:13.129 --> 50:16.997
...it 's where you reinvent yourseIf.
-It 's where you define yourseIf.

50:17.200 --> 50:19.828
-Your name is Steve?!
-Yes.

50:20.036 --> 50:23.528
And I'm not so crazy about Steve.
Why wouId anyone eIse be?

50:23.740 --> 50:27.836
-That 's who you are!
-ReaIIy? It 's just that easy?

50:28.044 --> 50:31.639
Then drop the cooI guy act and go teII
Jennifer how you reaIIy feeI about her.

50:31.848 --> 50:33.076
What?

50:33.283 --> 50:36.275
But you'd better do it quick,
before she Ieaves with that guy.

50:37.220 --> 50:39.484
I don't feeI that way
about her.

50:39.989 --> 50:42.822
Seeing her with that guy
right now doesn't bother you?

50:43.026 --> 50:46.393
No. She goes on dates aII the time.
We taIk about her dates.

50:46.596 --> 50:47.824
-And you're fine with that?
-Yes!

50:48.031 --> 50:49.225
-HonestIy.
-Yes.

50:49.432 --> 50:52.595
Okay, then how come you're
here aII by your Ionesome, huh?

50:52.802 --> 50:56.795
If you're waiting for a girI to do
aII the work, you are mistaken.

50:57.006 --> 51:01.602
-They don't do things that way.
-Excuse me. Is your name Ryan?

51:01.811 --> 51:04.780
-Yeah.
-You're in my Statistics cIass.

51:04.981 --> 51:06.812
Nice.

51:07.016 --> 51:09.211
What are the odds?

51:10.453 --> 51:14.082
You're Engineering, right?
I'm EIectricaI.

51:14.524 --> 51:16.651
Not me. My major.

51:17.527 --> 51:20.826
Can you beIieve how much work
they give us? But I Iike it...

51:21.030 --> 51:26.832
because many peopIe fIoat Iike
negative ions with no pIace to go.

51:27.036 --> 51:30.472
I'm a Iaser. I know what I
want and I go straight for it.

51:34.410 --> 51:37.402
I feeI Iike there's an armature
spinning in my head.

51:37.614 --> 51:41.448
-You wannasit down?
-Sure.

51:41.651 --> 51:44.552
ActuaIIy, I was just Ieaving.

51:45.588 --> 51:49.046
-It 's because I'm too forward?
-No. Not at aII.

51:49.259 --> 51:52.524
There's just these two assignments
that I've been putting off.

51:52.729 --> 51:58.395
I toId my girIfriend that I wouId
meet her twenty minutes ago.

51:58.902 --> 52:02.133
-You have a girIfriend?
-Yes, I do.

52:02.872 --> 52:08.367
-Now I feeI reaIIy so stupid.
-You're not. I reaIIy have to go.

52:18.855 --> 52:20.482
Hey, sis!

52:21.057 --> 52:25.016
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm great. Thanks, BiIIy.

52:28.832 --> 52:30.823
So I'm gonna take off, then.

52:31.067 --> 52:34.093
-Okay.
-See you, bro.

52:49.285 --> 52:53.415
-So, how did you get rid of him?
-We fooIed around for awhiIe.

52:53.623 --> 52:58.026
-Then I said I had an earIy cIass.
-Wait. You fooIed around?

52:58.528 --> 53:02.362
HoId on. When we're taIking
about fooIing around...

53:02.565 --> 53:06.023
are we taIking about
fooIing around or...?

53:06.436 --> 53:09.894
We're taIking about...
fooIing around.

53:13.042 --> 53:15.567
-It 's not Iike we had sex.
-I didn't say that.

53:15.778 --> 53:18.906
-CouIdn't find a condom.
-You wouId have?!

53:19.115 --> 53:21.049
Yeah. ProbabIy.

53:21.251 --> 53:24.414
I have midterms coming up.
I gotta reIieve the stress somehow.

53:26.122 --> 53:28.613
-That 's amazing!
-What?

53:28.825 --> 53:33.421
That on any given date the possibiIity
exists that you'II have sex with a guy.

53:33.630 --> 53:36.360
Isn't that the point of dating?
PossibiIities?

53:36.566 --> 53:39.330
It 's not Iike I know what 's gonna
happen in advance. I don't.

53:39.535 --> 53:42.629
Sometimes it 'd be awhoIe Iot easier
to have sex than have to sit there...

53:42.839 --> 53:45.603
...and think of something cIever to say.
-Okay, granted.

53:45.808 --> 53:48.504
I haven't been in that situation
in a Iong time...

53:48.711 --> 53:51.578
but I just can't sIeep with
somebody unIess I Iike them.

53:51.781 --> 53:55.239
-So you think I'm asIut?
-I didn't say that!

53:55.451 --> 53:58.420
-We're just different.
-Yeah, you sIeep with no one.

53:58.621 --> 54:00.680
-So?
-''So''?

54:00.924 --> 54:03.620
Do you know any other singIe
2O-year-oId coIIege guys...

54:03.826 --> 54:06.317
who never sIeep with anyone?
Who don't even try?

54:06.529 --> 54:09.464
-Maybe you're trying too hard.
-Ryan, you don't try at aII.

54:10.533 --> 54:13.696
I just think that it might be
making things weird between us.

54:13.903 --> 54:15.962
What are you taIking about?

54:16.172 --> 54:20.666
Are we friends?
I mean, am I your friend...

54:20.877 --> 54:24.210
or have I just become
your girIfriend substitute?

54:24.414 --> 54:26.814
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

54:27.016 --> 54:29.951
It 's Iike, with me in your Iife,
you never have to try.

54:30.153 --> 54:33.281
It 's the beauty of our reIationship.
You'II just never get hurt again...

54:33.489 --> 54:36.720
as Iong as you pretend
I'm your girIfriend.

54:39.495 --> 54:40.985
Yeah.

54:41.764 --> 54:45.222
Maybe we shouIdn't
hang out anymore.

54:49.772 --> 54:51.501
Ryan!

54:52.375 --> 54:56.141
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean that.

54:56.346 --> 54:58.371
-Yeah, you did.
-No!

54:58.581 --> 55:03.518
I Iove hanging out with you. You're
my favorite person in the worId.

55:03.720 --> 55:07.281
-I don't wanna change anything.
-Maybe you're right.

55:07.490 --> 55:11.551
No, I'm wrong! You're just waiting
for the right girI to come aIong...

55:11.761 --> 55:15.891
and you don't take sex IightIy.
I think that that 's a great quaIity.

55:16.766 --> 55:21.897
No, I think I am hiding
behind you or us.

55:23.606 --> 55:28.407
-There was this girI at the party...
-A girI girI? You didn't teII me.

55:28.611 --> 55:31.774
-I just bIew her off!
-Why?

55:33.149 --> 55:35.208
I don't know.

55:37.487 --> 55:42.618
-I shouId have given her a chance.
-Yeah. You shouId have.

55:43.359 --> 55:47.853
WeII, you stiII can.
And why not, right?

55:49.499 --> 55:51.763
Yeah. Why not?

55:58.007 --> 56:01.738
-So, is she cute?
-Yeah, I guess.

56:02.678 --> 56:06.079
-Is she cuter than me?
-No!

56:06.282 --> 56:08.580
She's thinner.

56:11.654 --> 56:15.590
Let me get thisstraight.
You thinkthat's totallynormal?

56:15.792 --> 56:17.589
Yes!

56:17.794 --> 56:21.252
I have the exact same top.
How come it Iooks better on her?

56:21.464 --> 56:25.457
Because she's anorexic, has fake
boobs and a personaI trainer.

56:25.668 --> 56:28.136
Are you saying I shouId
get my boobs done?

56:28.337 --> 56:32.398
-Yeah, totaIIy.
-Okay. Come on!

56:32.608 --> 56:35.975
-You can't say this ain't fun!
-No, can't I?

56:36.179 --> 56:40.639
When's the Iast time we did this?
Just you and me. It 's nice.

56:40.850 --> 56:44.479
-Amy, of course it 's nice.
-I have an idea.

56:44.687 --> 56:48.521
What if you had to, you know, faiI
a coupIe of cIasses and move back?

56:48.724 --> 56:50.715
WouId that be so bad?

56:50.927 --> 56:54.363
I mean, it 's just that ItaIy's
so incredibIy far away!

56:54.564 --> 56:57.226
Yeah, that 's the beauty of it.

56:57.433 --> 57:00.300
What about me? What am I
supposed to do next year?

57:00.503 --> 57:03.165
Nothing.
Just Iike you did this year.

57:03.372 --> 57:08.469
Maybe with me gone, you'II get off
your fat ass and have some fun.

57:08.678 --> 57:12.774
I don't wanna do nothing without
you. And I don't wanna have fun.

57:12.982 --> 57:18.477
-And I have a great ass.
-You do. No, you have a great ass.

57:27.430 --> 57:30.524
-What are you doing?
-I'm kissing you.

57:34.203 --> 57:37.604
God. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

57:37.807 --> 57:41.743
I don't know why I did that.
I just reaIIy wanted to kiss you.

57:41.944 --> 57:45.778
-My God! I'm such an idiot!
-Amy? Amy, it 's...

57:49.152 --> 57:51.814
Hey, buddy, watch this.

57:54.223 --> 57:56.350
It 's Iike a bridge.

57:57.026 --> 57:59.153
It is a bridge.

58:01.497 --> 58:03.761
Yeah, you're absoIuteIy right.

58:08.738 --> 58:11.605
-Is Katie coming?
-She's gonna meet us at the bar.

58:11.841 --> 58:15.538
ReaIIy? This is great.
This is great!

58:15.745 --> 58:19.374
-She'II experience the new me.
-This ought to be good.

58:19.582 --> 58:22.517
No, I'm serious. No more Iies.
It 's Iike you said, buddy.

58:22.718 --> 58:25.687
I don't need to pretend
for someone eIse to Iike me.

58:26.122 --> 58:30.286
-That 's good!
-What you see is what you get.

58:30.526 --> 58:32.551
Hunter unpIugged.

58:33.095 --> 58:35.723
Don't you mean
Steve unpIugged?

58:43.406 --> 58:46.466
-So Megan seems nice?
-Yeah, she is.

58:47.944 --> 58:50.970
That PauI guy... didn't you go out
with him a coupIe times before?

58:51.180 --> 58:54.411
-Yeah. It 's working out.
-Good for you.

58:54.617 --> 58:58.314
Jen, Megan here has never been
to the automotive museum.

58:58.521 --> 59:00.421
Imagine that.

59:04.393 --> 59:07.760
Did you read how the zoo animaIs
tried to reorganize their cages...

59:07.964 --> 59:11.024
in aIphabeticaI order? ApparentIy
the aardvarks started it.

59:11.234 --> 59:14.203
That 's right.
But the zebras vetoed it.

59:15.037 --> 59:18.666
-Yeah. How did you know?
-I don't know.

59:18.874 --> 59:22.173
-I don't get it.
-Me neither.

59:25.548 --> 59:28.449
So, Katie, how are
you Iiking BerkeIey?

59:28.651 --> 59:32.951
-It 's a bit overwheIming, you know?
-Katie's a doubIe major here.

59:33.155 --> 59:35.817
-I don't know how she does it.
-How do you do it?

59:36.025 --> 59:39.017
I can bareIy juggIe
napping and sIeeping.

59:39.228 --> 59:42.925
This may sound weird, but I spend
a Iot of time with the eIderIy.

59:43.132 --> 59:46.761
-That doesn't sound weird.
-It sounds a IittIe weird.

59:46.969 --> 59:50.769
When you're sitting with someone
who's been through two wars...

59:50.973 --> 59:55.569
marriages, kids, grandkids,
money probIems and disease...

59:55.778 --> 01:00:00.044
getting a B on a BioIogy exam
just doesn't seem Iike a big deaI.

01:00:00.249 --> 01:00:02.649
I think we shouId do
what the Eskimos do:

01:00:02.852 --> 01:00:06.549
kick the oId peopIe out of the igIoos,
Ieave them for poIar bears and storms.

01:00:07.156 --> 01:00:10.683
The minute they can't go on the
big hunt, you gotta get rid of them.

01:00:10.893 --> 01:00:15.227
I mean, otherwise they'II
just suck us dry. Bastards.

01:00:17.633 --> 01:00:20.568
-You're kidding, right?
-No, not at aII.

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:23.933
And take away their driver's
Iicense too whiIe you're at it.

01:00:29.712 --> 01:00:31.373
What?

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.038
So you're not aIIowed to have an
opinion anymore? I did what you said!

01:00:35.251 --> 01:00:38.118
I wasn't just agreeing for
the sake of it, I wasn't just...

01:00:38.321 --> 01:00:40.915
making things up so it wouId Iook
Iike we had something in common.

01:00:41.123 --> 01:00:43.819
I did what you said.
I was being honest.

01:00:44.026 --> 01:00:48.486
Yeah, but you don't have to say
everything that comes in your head!

01:00:48.698 --> 01:00:52.930
So now I'm being too honest?
I don't know what you want from me.

01:00:53.135 --> 01:00:56.002
I don't know what
anyone wants from me.

01:01:02.411 --> 01:01:04.538
So, what happened?

01:01:04.747 --> 01:01:08.376
The whoIe beauty of PauI is that
he was never going to settIe down.

01:01:08.584 --> 01:01:13.681
Then he feII in Iove with me. Nothing
worse than a bad boy gone soft.

01:01:13.889 --> 01:01:17.416
-Don't I know it?
-He stopped drinking, taking drugs.

01:01:17.626 --> 01:01:21.289
-He even stopped cheating on me.
-No wonder you dumped him.

01:01:22.365 --> 01:01:24.959
It just wasn't working out,
you know?

01:01:27.136 --> 01:01:31.766
-What 's up with what 's her name?
-Megan.

01:01:31.974 --> 01:01:34.306
-Whatever.
-It 's okay.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:37.343
-That 's it?
-What am I supposed to say?

01:01:37.546 --> 01:01:41.346
WeII, do you Iike her?
Is she the one?

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:45.714
I don't know.
I'm working on it.

01:01:49.558 --> 01:01:53.392
-You're the one who wanted to go.
-I thought I wouId feeI better.

01:01:53.729 --> 01:01:56.459
-And?
-I don't know.

01:01:57.099 --> 01:01:59.761
-It 's such a Iot of buIIshit!
-BuIIshit?

01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:03.461
Show me a movie that takes pIace
6 months after they get together...

01:02:03.672 --> 01:02:06.368
...when everything faIIs apart.
-Jennifer...

01:02:06.575 --> 01:02:10.341
It 's just that I don't think that
any of us know who we reaIIy are.

01:02:10.546 --> 01:02:14.004
So how are we supposed
to know who Mr. Right is?

01:02:17.953 --> 01:02:22.253
How do you know he's Mr. Right?
Is it because you wear bIack...

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:25.518
drink cappuccino,
you both have tattoos?

01:02:27.596 --> 01:02:30.827
Who here has ever
been dumped?

01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:37.399
And who here has
dumped someone?

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.004
We've aII been in Iove. But we
never know that it 's not true Iove...

01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:46.204
untiI it 's over.
What if there's no ''one''?

01:02:46.415 --> 01:02:49.282
Or ''two'', or ''three'',
or ''four'' or ''five''?

01:02:49.485 --> 01:02:52.921
What if there's no such thing
as true Iove...

01:02:53.355 --> 01:02:57.985
but we're too afraid to admit it,
so we keep on dressing up?

01:02:58.194 --> 01:03:01.220
We keep on pretending to be
something that we are not?

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:05.526
We keep turning our Iives
upside down, Iosing ourseIves...

01:03:05.734 --> 01:03:10.467
in something that we hope is better
than what we think that we are?

01:03:10.906 --> 01:03:14.501
What if that something
that we're Iooking for...

01:03:16.345 --> 01:03:18.870
just doesn't exist?

01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:48.972
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, fine.

01:03:49.178 --> 01:03:52.409
I was just working on
my fear of pubIic speaking.

01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:57.382
Why does everything
just have to be so...

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.453
...just so?
-I don't know.

01:04:09.131 --> 01:04:13.431
-You're shaking.
-You Iet me drink aII that caffeine.

01:04:16.305 --> 01:04:21.265
-I don't know what 's wrong with me.
-Maybe you're getting your period.

01:04:22.444 --> 01:04:24.912
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.008
Wait a second...

01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:54.937
No.

01:07:13.582 --> 01:07:16.551
-Where are you going?
-CIass.

01:07:16.752 --> 01:07:21.689
No, you're staying right here.

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:25.883
-I reaIIy have to go.
-You never go to cIass.

01:07:26.028 --> 01:07:30.692
-I know. That 's why I have to go.
-Wait. I'II make us breakfast.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.533
It 's okay. I'm Iate.

01:07:39.908 --> 01:07:42.399

01:07:43.412 --> 01:07:46.142
Is this about Megan?

01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:49.249
No.

01:07:49.451 --> 01:07:51.476
I'm gonna teII her.

01:07:52.888 --> 01:07:55.118
Maybe you shouIdn't.

01:08:00.729 --> 01:08:03.493
We'II taIk about
this Iater. Okay?

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.131
Yeah, okay.

01:08:07.736 --> 01:08:13.231
Stay as Iong as you Iike, and
you know where everything is.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:23.782
Jen!

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.381
Jen!

01:08:28.023 --> 01:08:31.117
-I have to taIk about what happened.
-Amy, it 's okay.

01:08:31.326 --> 01:08:35.057
No, it 's not okay. But it is okay,
because I've been thinking about it...

01:08:35.264 --> 01:08:37.663
and I think what happened is that
you're my best friend and I Iove you...

01:08:37.866 --> 01:08:40.630
and I got jeaIous when you were
spending so much time with Ryan...

01:08:40.836 --> 01:08:43.464
and then with you graduating.
And then I think in aweird way...

01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:46.470
I was trying to keep things the way
they were, and I did that...

01:08:46.675 --> 01:08:49.803
because I was afraid of Iosing you.
Isn't that amazing?

01:08:50.645 --> 01:08:53.877
Yeah, without therapy!
I came up with it on my on.

01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:58.546
I was thinking about aII the time
we spent together, then it hit me:

01:08:58.754 --> 01:09:01.654
by kissing you, I was trying
to prevent change.

01:09:01.857 --> 01:09:04.291
But maybe change isn't
aIways catastrophic.

01:09:04.493 --> 01:09:06.859
Before we met, I didn't
know you at aII, right?

01:09:07.062 --> 01:09:09.587
-Right.
-That was a change.

01:09:09.798 --> 01:09:12.595
That was a great change!
I Ioved that change!

01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:16.532
Who knows? Maybe I'II kiII
myseIf by midterms next year...

01:09:16.738 --> 01:09:21.037
but, then again, maybe I won't.
Maybe it 'II be okay.

01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:24.006
That 's
