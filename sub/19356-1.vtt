[Birds chirping]

01:24.084 --> 01:25.176
[Sighs]

01:36.888 --> 01:38.731
[Sizzling]

01:41.268 --> 01:42.941
- Good morning.
- Hey.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.105
You mean, good afternoon?

01:46.732 --> 01:48.234
Afternoon.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.741
A bacon sandwich?

01:52.029 --> 01:53.155
- [Clanking]
- No.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.744
A bacon sandwich?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.754
No, thanks.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.628
You should.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.214
It'll make you feel better.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.809
[Woman hums]

02:18.138 --> 02:19.230
[Clanking]

02:19.514 --> 02:20.994
Things haven't exactly
turned out well

02:21.058 --> 02:23.561
after last night.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.275
Somehow I guessed
they wouldn't have.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.281
Andrew left a note to say

02:28.565 --> 02:31.819
that he was so embarrassed
by me and Gerald

02:32.110 --> 02:34.954
that he is going
back to school early.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.364
He said that I'm,

02:36.657 --> 02:38.785
"the stupidest person
he has every met,"

02:39.076 --> 02:41.625
and that he will meet you
at college.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.749
Gerald's left as well.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.041
Or rather...

02:47.167 --> 02:48.259
I threw him out last night.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.635
[Chuckles]

02:49.920 --> 02:51.797
I'm sure he won't be
returning either.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.384
That's good.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.178
I know it is.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.013
Are you sure?

03:01.306 --> 03:03.684
Yes...

03:03.975 --> 03:05.648
Yes.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.176
Intellectually and emotionally,

03:07.270 --> 03:08.567
I'm sure.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.863
But...

03:12.150 --> 03:15.620
I've relied on the bastard
for the last five years.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.747
So it feels pretty strange.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.963
Leaves all kinds
of complications.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.548
And what about Beth?

03:34.172 --> 03:37.142
I saw her on the stairs
this morning.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.746
I caught up with her
halfway down,

03:38.969 --> 03:40.687
so you probably
wouldn't have heard

03:40.971 --> 03:43.690
the poor girl
expressing her opinions.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.899
She got up on her own, I guess.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.909
She was looking for you.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.575
She saw the two of us.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.416
You did tell her
it wasn't what it looked like.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.801
Of course I tried.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.759
She wasn't in the mood
to listen.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.046
I meant to go up to her,

04:16.255 --> 04:18.805
but we started playing cards...

04:21.344 --> 04:22.516
And the door was locked.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.353
Fucking door was locked.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.732
[Whispers]
I'm so screwed.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.644
Perhaps it's for the best.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.027
No.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.752
You may be happy
to be rid of Gerald,

04:31.938 --> 04:34.236
but I'm not so happy
to lose Beth.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.946
I...

04:37.944 --> 04:40.242
I should call her.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.124
Do you love her?

04:46.036 --> 04:48.255
Yes.
I think so.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.085
No, really.
Do you?

04:54.419 --> 04:55.716
Is it really the end
of the world

04:56.004 --> 04:57.847
that she thinks
you've been unfaithful?

05:00.342 --> 05:01.844
If you're meant to be together,

05:02.135 --> 05:03.603
you'll get over this.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.696
Don't worry,
she isn't gonna say anything

05:06.807 --> 05:08.059
to anyone.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.444
She'd look stupid.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.318
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you'd like.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.578
No matter how bad things seem
right now,

05:20.862 --> 05:22.864
they'll be a little easier
by tonight.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.455
And tomorrow
they'll be even better still.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.743
Doesn't change the fact

05:27.994 --> 05:30.338
that I'll still have
to call her.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.420
How pathetic will you sound?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.502
If she really loves you,
she'll come back

05:35.794 --> 05:38.263
and ask for your side
of the story.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.348
Let her prove her love.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.318
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

06:41.610 --> 06:43.704
Uh, nothing.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.706
- I was looking for you.
- Oh.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.514
Listen, I think I'm gonna
head back to the dorm,

06:53.538 --> 06:55.961
first thing tomorrow.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.422
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.506
You just got here.

07:02.797 --> 07:03.923
Yeah, I know,

07:04.215 --> 07:07.560
but I can't stand it anymore
is the problem.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.016
What do you mean?

07:09.304 --> 07:10.806
This is your house.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.691
- You like it here. It's why we came.
- Yeah, I know.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.215
But it's my sister's boyfriend,

07:15.268 --> 07:16.645
<i>that fuckhead.</i>

07:16.937 --> 07:18.122
I didn't know that he'd be here.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.489
I can't stand the guy.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.617
[Man]
He's not a bad artist.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.126
He's a pretentious asshole
is what he is.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.332
All he fucking does
is quote French poetry.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.258
Anyway, I know that you won't

07:38.541 --> 07:40.061
get to see Elizabeth again
for a while,

07:40.085 --> 07:42.838
so you two can stay if you want.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.805
No, if you're leaving
we'll leave as well, so...

07:48.093 --> 07:50.095
- Come on.
- No.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.604
I can't.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.140
But you two stay.
That's fine.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.526
And you don't think
you're sister won't mind?

07:56.601 --> 07:57.818
Miranda?

07:58.103 --> 07:59.103
No.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.776
She could care less
about anything.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.782
Come on, it's just
one more night.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.266
Okay, listen, can we step away

08:04.526 --> 08:06.253
from the nude paintings
of my sister, please?

08:06.277 --> 08:07.950
Let's go.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.633
By the way, Elizabeth is over
there by herself with those two.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.284
So, hurry up.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.576
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.720
[Man]
Green shadows,

08:24.004 --> 08:27.929
the moist evenings of summer.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.560
The man's depth of thought.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.188
- Shut the fuck up, Gerald.
Expressions...

08:33.471 --> 08:34.813
[laughs]

08:38.643 --> 08:40.770
He's always quoting,

08:41.062 --> 08:42.313
as my British uncle would say,

08:42.605 --> 08:44.323
"bloody, Baudelaire."

08:45.400 --> 08:46.902
- Hey, Gerald?
- Hmm?

08:47.193 --> 08:49.130
Did the moist green shadows
remind you of that quote,

08:49.154 --> 08:50.314
or did the quote create them?

08:50.572 --> 08:52.916
Hey, Lucian, just be quiet.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.170
[Miranda]
He's too tedious.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.503
Oh, you do embarrass me
with your compliments.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.090
Oh, my god,
you're far too self-obsessed.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.379
[Laughs]

09:06.671 --> 09:07.871
It's the height of bad manners

09:08.089 --> 09:09.849
to leave your guests
to entertain themselves.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.802
- Good bye, Andrew.
- [Andrew] Fuck you.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.390
[Miranda]
Andrew!

09:15.013 --> 09:17.516
- Ugh!
- [Gerald] Well...

09:18.600 --> 09:20.352
I need a new drink.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.643
A real one.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.322
This is getting far too...

09:24.606 --> 09:25.778
Terrible.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.604
[Elizabeth]
Yeah, you know what?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.872
I'm actually,
I'm gonna go upstairs.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.959
Even though it's early,
I'm going to bed.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.874
I'll be there in a minute.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.926
I hope Elizabeth appreciates

09:46.211 --> 09:48.464
that Gerald was just
trying to upset her.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.850
You shouldn't give him
that satisfaction.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.259
Yeah.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.308
She seems a bit high-strung.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.773
Maybe.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.947
I don't know.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.833
I mean, convincing her to come
wasn't easy,

10:07.857 --> 10:11.907
but until a few moments ago,
things were going great.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.657
What's the problem
between you two?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.787
There's no problem.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.047
Of course there is.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.175
I'm not stupid.

10:28.378 --> 10:31.348
I just have to be back
at school on Monday.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.305
I won't see her for a while.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.392
I thought she was at Yale
with you and Andrew.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.227
No, not quite.
She's...

10:40.515 --> 10:41.892
She's at Berkley.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.223
Other side of the country.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.395
Hmm.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.406
Are you trying to keep your
relationship going long distance?

10:50.733 --> 10:53.486
- We're trying.
- Hmm.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.498
I should go see
if Beth is all right.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.376
Oh, I think she's just fine.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.877
I might turn in early as well,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.755
I'm tired and I need some sleep.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.086
Ahh, sleep.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.468
Every evening's
sinister adventure.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.593
Well, thank you.
I'll see you guys later.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.098
Hmm.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.224
Lucian?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.736
I'm sorry.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.073
You don't have to baby me,
it's all right.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.862
Go hang out with Gerald.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.657
I don't wanna
hang out with Gerald.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.663
Why not? He's an artist,
just like you want to be.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.379
I don't want to be an artist.

11:50.084 --> 11:53.964
You changed your major to art.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.132
Art history.
I told you.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.818
I haven't
officially changed it yet.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.560
I was just thinking about it.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.266
[Sighs]

12:01.554 --> 12:04.774
What are you gonna do
with an art history degree?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.436
With an engineering degree,
your dad could get you a job

12:07.727 --> 12:08.727
right after college.

12:08.853 --> 12:13.029
I mean, you wanted that, right?

12:13.316 --> 12:14.363
I don't know.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.699
You sound stupid.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.711
Like already in college,
just decide.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.004
You've changed.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.551
Well, it's been five months.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.310
So, yeah...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.016
I have changed a little bit.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.897
But it's still me.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.736
Five months ago,

12:54.023 --> 12:56.025
you wouldn't have
wanted anything to do

12:56.317 --> 12:59.537
with somebody like Gerald,
or Miranda...

12:59.821 --> 13:02.916
Come on. He's just trying to
get a reaction out of us.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.577
And if we run away, he wins.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.836
We can't let that asshole win.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.293
Right?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.504
I don't care.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.386
I don't know him. I don't even
know what we're doing here.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.297
I thought it would be fun.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.694
Come on...

13:31.978 --> 13:34.072
We could still
go get dinner in town.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.026
Maine clams, lobster...

13:40.862 --> 13:42.910
Let's get out of here
for a while.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.743
No. No. No.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.580
I'm not hungry, I'm exhausted.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.213
[Miranda]
How ls Elizabeth?

13:58.504 --> 13:59.904
Oh, she's all right.
We were just...

14:00.006 --> 14:01.804
Wondering what to do
about dinner tonight.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.267
[Gerald]
Well!

14:06.554 --> 14:10.559
What wonderful events have
we planned for this evening?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.786
It's lovely to see that you
haven't gone to bed yet.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.404
- [Laughs]
- I was about to...

14:15.688 --> 14:19.738
Not before we've consumed vast
quantities of alcohol, right?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.347
We've been drinking
all day, and yesterday.

14:22.372 --> 14:23.145
Oh...

14:25.031 --> 14:28.331
We've hardly
even started, Lucian.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.211
Oh, some for me.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.997
Here we go.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.666
Here you go.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.631
That right.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.263
There you go, my dear.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.345
Who... well...

14:45.885 --> 14:48.354
I propose a game of cards.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.728
Oh, I don't know, I...

14:52.016 --> 14:53.393
Huh?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.812
What?

14:56.104 --> 14:58.778
I guess I can play
for a few minutes, yeah.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.237
That's right.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.736
That's good.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.367
So...

15:09.659 --> 15:11.787
What should we play for?
Hmm?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.878
I didn't realize
we were playing for anything.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.798
[Miranda]
Of course you are.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.380
But I warn you,
all Gerald will play is poker.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.668
He doesn't do anything

15:19.794 --> 15:21.262
unless he can make money at it.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.546
What about his art'?

15:22.713 --> 15:24.636
Well, his reason for painting me

15:24.924 --> 15:26.141
is that it turns him on.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.906
You see, it also turns
other people on

15:28.052 --> 15:29.679
and they pay him
large amounts of money

15:29.971 --> 15:33.271
for the erotica that I pose for.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.024
Look at her.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.563
She's posing now.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.607
[Miranda laughs]

15:40.898 --> 15:41.898
- [Laughs]
- It's quite

15:42.108 --> 15:44.156
a convenient arrangement,
really.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.280
So, you always paint Miranda?

15:47.572 --> 15:48.757
Well, I am the only inspiration

15:48.781 --> 15:49.781
for his art.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.032
It annoys him, though,

15:51.117 --> 15:52.386
because he hates not being given

15:52.410 --> 15:54.959
complete credit for his work.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.686
- That's not true.
- Of course it is!

15:56.831 --> 15:58.511
- No, it's not...
- You're wandering around

15:58.541 --> 16:00.168
with your head
in self-generated clouds

16:00.460 --> 16:02.758
of hot air,
until someone says to you,

16:03.045 --> 16:04.797
"well, if it wasn't for Miranda,

16:05.089 --> 16:06.341
would you be
as good a painter?"

16:09.051 --> 16:11.474
Whatever makes you happy,
my dear.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.269
Why don't you just try
painting someone else?

16:17.560 --> 16:20.109
Or something other than nudes?

16:20.396 --> 16:22.774
Well, he has.
But as I said...

16:24.734 --> 16:27.112
I'm the only inspiration
for his art.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.589
Anything else he tries to paint

16:28.613 --> 16:30.035
just comes out worth less.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.041
Deal the cards.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.202
[Miranda]
Treat him nicely.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.542
I will treat him
however the hell I want.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.989
He comes here, eats our food,

16:38.206 --> 16:41.050
drinks our wine,
enjoys our company.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.757
He ask impertinent questions
about my art.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.045
He's like

16:45.129 --> 16:46.847
your so-called brother,
Miranda.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.804
A parasite.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.685
But then again,
aren't you like him?

16:51.969 --> 16:53.405
For aren't all the lovers
of great men

16:53.429 --> 16:54.931
but parasites?

17:01.812 --> 17:04.486
[Gerald laughs]

17:04.773 --> 17:06.367
She's nice, isn't she?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.803
[Bottle shatters]

17:27.213 --> 17:29.011
[Laughs]

17:30.258 --> 17:32.886
[Laughing]

17:33.177 --> 17:34.724
Should I leave?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.521
This damn pen doesn't work.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.856
Ah.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.736
Use matches.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.111
Thank you.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.160
All right.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.745
Each one of these
will be worth $5.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.080
All right?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.344
Fine, but I can only play
a couple hands,

18:00.621 --> 18:02.589
and then I have to go to bed.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.801
I thought Elizabeth
was coming down.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.808
[Stutters]
Let's do this.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.388
Hmm?

18:16.804 --> 18:18.181
Check.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.060
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.146
Call.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.041
Three of a kind.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.125
How many did you say?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.134
[Gerald]
Two you and two for me.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.588
One... two.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.427
[Chuckles]

18:52.715 --> 18:53.715
Call.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.139
[Gerald]
All right then. Call.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.724
Sorry about that.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.355
No, you're not.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.641
Yes he is, but he shouldn't be.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.435
Double or quits, underhand.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.747
- Sorry.
- [Scoffs] Bastard!

19:17.865 --> 19:19.492
Again!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.926
Deal and drink.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.434
Ooh.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.274
- He's a gambling man.
- [Chuckles]

19:49.271 --> 19:53.492
[Gerald whispers]
One, two, three, four, five.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.366
What are you gonna do?

19:56.654 --> 19:58.327
One, two, three...

19:58.614 --> 20:00.662
- I win! -I mean, why
don't we just quit now?

20:00.950 --> 20:03.373
We're not gonna quit,
I need a drink.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.538
You've drunk too much.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.507
What do you know?

20:12.795 --> 20:14.718
Beloved Brandy.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.304
[Laughs]

20:20.052 --> 20:21.895
Now, let's see
if Brandy changes my luck.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.321
We'll see, won't we, dear?

20:30.604 --> 20:31.901
Won't we see?

20:32.189 --> 20:33.236
Yes.

20:33.524 --> 20:34.616
- Won't we, dear?
- Yes.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.698
Won't we see?
[Laughs]

20:36.986 --> 20:39.256
- Give that back, you bastard.
- Not until you stop swearing.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
- Asshole.
- [Laughs]

20:40.531 --> 20:41.811
Well, now, you're definitely not

20:41.949 --> 20:43.427
- gonna get it back.
- Give it back to me!

20:43.451 --> 20:44.451
Will you'? No, you won't!

20:44.493 --> 20:45.665
- Give it!
- Okay!

20:45.953 --> 20:47.705
"Peter Walsh got up
and crossed the win-"

20:47.997 --> 20:49.999
- give it here!
- Go fetch it!

20:50.291 --> 20:52.669
Go fetch it!

20:52.960 --> 20:54.928
[Laughs]

20:55.212 --> 20:56.452
You started that game of cards,

20:56.672 --> 20:58.219
you fucking finish it!

20:58.507 --> 21:01.010
Okay, okay, Miranda.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.975
[Laughs]

21:10.561 --> 21:11.687
[Whispers]
Asshole.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.078
[Gerald]
Let's go again.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.369
Now, deal the cards.

21:23.491 --> 21:24.617
They're dealt.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.248
Well...

21:40.633 --> 21:43.182
Well, Brandy's done the trick,
hasn't it?

21:43.469 --> 21:44.595
[Laughs]

21:44.887 --> 21:46.639
Hasn't it, Miranda?
Huh?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.905
This time it'll be
all that money.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.823
[Laughs]

22:04.114 --> 22:06.287
Against all of my canvases.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.248
They're not all yours
to give away, are they?

22:14.500 --> 22:15.843
All the paintings in the house

22:16.126 --> 22:17.594
are of Miranda.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.505
But she doesn't own them.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.265
Do you?

22:41.277 --> 22:42.904
Well...

22:43.195 --> 22:46.039
That's everything then.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.147
[Door slams]

23:26.405 --> 23:28.407
He can have it all back,
I don't want it.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.709
We've obviously all had
too much to drink and-

23:31.994 --> 23:33.337
oh, bullshit.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.043
No, we haven't had
nearly enough.

23:35.331 --> 23:39.427
And no, you won
everything fairly.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.383
It's all rightfully yours.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.444
[Door shuts]

24:01.357 --> 24:03.451
[Faint shouting]

24:15.204 --> 24:17.002
[Gerald]
Fucking Ivy league bullshit!

24:33.013 --> 24:34.560
Elizabeth?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.313
Beth.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.897
It's me.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.868
Open the door.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.315
[Rain pouring]

25:28.652 --> 25:31.326
[Thunder rumbles]

26:39.515 --> 26:42.018
[Door clan ks]

26:42.309 --> 26:43.902
[Footsteps tapping]

26:47.773 --> 26:49.150
You're not in bed yet?

26:49.441 --> 26:52.490
No, I'd fallen asleep.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.200
Where have you been?

26:54.488 --> 26:55.865
I've thrown him out.

26:57.491 --> 26:58.788
Really?

26:59.868 --> 27:01.745
[Panting]

27:02.037 --> 27:05.132
Oh, the best thing
I ever did, of course.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.282
I don't know why I ever took up

27:08.460 --> 27:09.586
with the bastard.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.680
- So, why did you?
- What?

27:18.762 --> 27:20.514
Take him off.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.560
Oh, do you want some?

27:24.852 --> 27:26.445
[Lucian]
No.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.117
- [Miranda gags] - What's wrong?
Are you okay?

27:34.194 --> 27:36.492
[Miranda]
Sick, nauseous.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.545
[Gasping]

27:43.829 --> 27:45.251
[Spits]

27:49.626 --> 27:51.628
Give a woman a bit of privacy.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.637
Sorry.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.605
I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.185
[Giggles]

29:30.227 --> 29:32.025
It's yours now.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.448
What do you mean?

29:34.731 --> 29:36.950
You won everything.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.362
The paintings, at cards.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.666
Well that's gonna
be pretty awkward tomorrow

29:42.781 --> 29:44.501
when I have to give it
all back to Gerald...

29:44.741 --> 29:48.416
Gerald's not coming back.
God, I told you that.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.585
It's yours now.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.146
Where could he
have possibly gone

29:57.170 --> 29:58.547
at this time of night?

29:58.839 --> 30:01.513
Who knows?
I don't know.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.054
He may be half-way
to Boston by now.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.222
Maybe Canada.

30:08.598 --> 30:11.602
Somewhere far away.
Maybe Bermuda.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.236
[Chuckles]

30:13.520 --> 30:16.444
Quoting Baudelaire to himself.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.830
You're wrong to call it erotica.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.663
It's not designed to...

30:26.950 --> 30:28.372
To titillate.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.423
You mean you're not titillated?

30:38.211 --> 30:39.929
You don't like them.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.681
No, they're...

30:41.965 --> 30:42.965
They're good, but...

30:46.470 --> 30:48.564
They just don't seem quite...

30:50.098 --> 30:51.315
Complete.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.611
I know what you mean.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.943
Yeah.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.404
His earlier work
might be more understandable.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.114
Or something.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.699
More like me.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.500
Do you have any of those here?

31:08.784 --> 31:11.207
There's one upstairs in my room.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.712
Your room?
[Chuckles]

31:12.996 --> 31:13.996
Come on.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.168
I'll show it to you.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.224
[Giggles]

31:24.508 --> 31:26.260
Come on.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.849
[Lucian]
It's very nice.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.234
I was pretty young then.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.545
I suppose that picture
is yours as well.

31:55.872 --> 31:56.872
[Scoffs]

31:57.040 --> 31:58.417
I suppose so.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.971
I'm going to have
a great big bonfire

32:03.255 --> 32:05.599
with all of Gerald's stuff.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.681
Why not just box it all up
and put it in storage?

32:08.969 --> 32:10.516
[Sighs]
There's too much.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.806
God, it'll take me weeks
to burn all this stuff.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.726
You've never seen
such a hoarder.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.065
I don't know,
my mother was-

32:18.353 --> 32:19.353
no, I promise.

32:19.563 --> 32:21.565
You've never seen anyone
like him.

32:21.857 --> 32:25.532
It's all bullshit.
He only had mediocre talent.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.630
When he moved in here,
he brought all of this shit

32:27.654 --> 32:29.076
with him.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.752
Guess we're all hoarders.

33:04.858 --> 33:05.984
Sit down.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.622
You don't understand.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.629
It wasn't unreasonable
that he might wanna keep

33:17.913 --> 33:20.291
his old sketchbooks
and canvases but...

33:22.125 --> 33:25.800
His old clothes, his old shoes.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.840
Magazines and crap.

33:30.926 --> 33:34.021
Most people th row stuff away
eventually, but not Gerald.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.102
He kept everything.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.067
And he made collections
of all kinds of things.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.525
It only made it worse.

33:42.812 --> 33:43.904
Like what?

33:45.273 --> 33:48.447
Birds eggs,
butterflies, stamps...

33:50.487 --> 33:52.990
Match box tops,
cigarette packets.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.410
Never anything of value.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.166
[Sighs]

34:07.712 --> 34:10.215
The day he moved in here...

34:10.507 --> 34:13.260
I expected him
to bring a suitcase.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.523
But he brought
a whole goddamn truck.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.619
Everything's gonna be fine.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.670
Ugh. Ignore me,
I'm so stupid.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.130
[Birds chirping]

37:19.863 --> 37:22.616
I can't believe
how beautiful this place is.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.089
Why don't you guys
have chairs out here?

37:29.372 --> 37:31.374
Gerald preferred the patio.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.215
With the trees, the ferns.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.721
- The moist...
- Green shadows...

37:41.968 --> 37:44.016
I think that Gerald is dead.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.894
Why do you say that?

37:48.641 --> 37:51.611
A quiet feeling of liberation
has come over me.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.372
What happened out there?
I mean...

38:08.828 --> 38:10.250
Nothing. I fell.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.797
Let's go swimming.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.022
[Laughs]

38:32.310 --> 38:33.402
Come on.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.860
Come on, let's go.
Let's go into the water.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.900
<i>- Are you... you wet-Kent momma.
- No.</i>

38:39.192 --> 38:40.952
This is Maine,
the water's probably freezing.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.238
Come on.
Let's get undressed.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.996
Let's go.
[Giggles]

38:48.117 --> 38:49.664
Are you coming?

38:51.287 --> 38:52.789
- If we're gonna do this...
- Uh-huh.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.801
- We're not even gonna think about it.
- No.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.172
- We're just gonna go.
- Let's go.

38:58.503 --> 38:59.846
Okay.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.181
[Giggles]

39:03.258 --> 39:05.181
I can feel the cold...

39:07.220 --> 39:09.063
[Screams]

39:12.767 --> 39:14.360
Come on.
This was your idea.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.317
Why is it so...

39:19.649 --> 39:21.617
It's so cold
that I can feel my skeleton.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.491
[Laughs]

39:36.332 --> 39:38.960
- Okay.
- Let's go.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.809
[Shrieks]

40:15.955 --> 40:17.995
[Shivers] Wait, you have a
little leaf in your hair.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.082
Right" okay.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.755
[Laughs]

40:21.044 --> 40:24.218
Oh boy.
[Gasps]

40:24.505 --> 40:26.052
Hey.

40:27.717 --> 40:30.436
Where are all
Gerald's paintings?

40:30.720 --> 40:32.814
Well, my paintings.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.275
[Shivers]

40:37.477 --> 40:39.479
I mean... I mean,
where are all

40:39.771 --> 40:41.011
the small ones that were there,

40:41.230 --> 40:42.698
and the...

40:44.108 --> 40:46.611
And those over there.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.377
And where's his paintbrush?

40:54.661 --> 40:56.180
I don't know.
I can't see them anywhere.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.048
He must have taken them
with him.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.380
Taken them with him?

41:01.668 --> 41:03.215
What's he playing at?

41:06.756 --> 41:10.101
I mean, you told me he was gone.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.103
- Right?
- Yeah.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.941
Whoa.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.446
He must have taken him
a while to do this.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.951
I mean, this painting,
it's quite different now.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.241
It's...

41:35.451 --> 41:37.169
It's not only purple, it's...

41:39.455 --> 41:40.455
It's red.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.001
It's red.

41:47.547 --> 41:48.764
It almost looks like it's dry.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.176
Hey! Don't touch it.

41:53.261 --> 41:55.480
Sorry.
Hey, wait.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.494
What the hell is going on?

42:13.448 --> 42:15.075
Hey, wait.

42:17.076 --> 42:18.636
Why don't you
just look up all the doors

42:18.661 --> 42:19.805
I guess you'll have to hear him

42:19.829 --> 42:21.706
- come in.
- Hmm.

42:21.998 --> 42:24.501
I don't lock the doors.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.135
I guess he'd have
his own key anyway.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.734
[Faucet creaks]

42:50.234 --> 42:52.862
But you saw him leave, right?

42:53.154 --> 42:55.248
[Miranda] He hit me and
<i>I</i> fell to the ground.

42:55.531 --> 42:58.080
And then I hit him,
I didn't see where he went.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.415
Maybe he simply came back.

43:07.752 --> 43:10.551
I'm gonna go warm myself up.

43:10.838 --> 43:12.010
Okay.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.405
Oh, hey.

43:37.532 --> 43:39.455
Hey, I was thinking...

43:39.742 --> 43:41.039
Why didn't you just run away?

43:41.327 --> 43:42.447
I mean, the bastard hit you,

43:42.662 --> 43:43.788
what were you gonna do?

43:44.080 --> 43:47.550
My plan was simple,
I was going to kill him.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.131
Fair enough.

43:49.418 --> 43:51.512
That means he probably
in the house with us now.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.049
Listening to us, no doubt.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.434
He's such an idiot!

43:58.803 --> 44:01.522
I want him to be gone.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.308
Why don't you
just tell him that?

44:07.019 --> 44:09.067
Our relationship was convenient

44:09.355 --> 44:10.823
in lots of ways.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.859
All the best ones are.

44:13.151 --> 44:14.698
Love has never come
into marriage.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.329
At least not happy marriages.

44:16.612 --> 44:17.923
You need to find
the right partner

44:17.947 --> 44:20.951
for practical,
not romantic reasons.

44:21.242 --> 44:24.712
Romance exists
outside marriage, right?

44:24.996 --> 44:26.043
I wouldn't know.

44:28.124 --> 44:29.644
People who are together
for a long time

44:29.709 --> 44:31.211
eventually start
to hate each other

44:31.502 --> 44:33.783
so you need to find a person
who doesn't mind being hated.

44:33.963 --> 44:36.057
[Giggles]
Come one.

44:36.340 --> 44:40.436
Tell me the truth.
You hate Gerald.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.688
Everyone
who's ever met him does.

44:42.972 --> 44:44.533
I don't know him
well enough to hate him.

44:44.557 --> 44:46.434
[Giggles]

44:47.977 --> 44:49.650
'[Thuds]
- [Gasps]

44:52.732 --> 44:54.484
He's down there.

44:54.775 --> 44:57.244
[Scoffs]
You know he's down there.

44:57.528 --> 44:58.547
I get it, you guys are just

44:58.571 --> 44:59.691
playing games with me again.

44:59.947 --> 45:02.666
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not.

45:04.660 --> 45:07.254
Will you go look for him?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.131
Um...

45:09.415 --> 45:10.917
I'm sorry...

45:11.209 --> 45:13.678
Okay...

45:13.961 --> 45:15.981
You go down the front stairs,
I'll go down the back ones,

45:16.005 --> 45:17.149
and we'll meet him in the hall.

45:17.173 --> 45:18.550
No, can we go together?

45:18.841 --> 45:21.310
No, we can't go together.
This house is huge.

45:21.594 --> 45:22.754
I mean, he could be anywhere.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.355
We have to do it separately.

45:24.639 --> 45:26.141
Come on,
it'll be like hide and seek.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.070
Just, I need a second
to get dressed.

45:31.354 --> 45:32.480
Oh, of course.
Okay.

45:32.772 --> 45:34.399
I'll wait for you.

45:34.690 --> 45:35.816
All right.

45:48.788 --> 45:49.914
Wait.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.918
Let's get this over with.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.804
You can prove he isn't here,
or that he is.

46:00.091 --> 46:01.718
Whatever you wanna do.

46:03.386 --> 46:04.888
You can go look by yourself,

46:05.179 --> 46:07.602
I don't wanna waste my time
chasing after him.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.984
Come on, Miranda.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.771
See it as a game.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.566
Yeah, sure.

46:18.067 --> 46:21.241
You take this staircase,
I'll take this one.

46:21.529 --> 46:23.452
If you see him, scream.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.509
[Gasps]
Oh.

47:17.793 --> 47:19.261
[Sighs]

47:19.545 --> 47:20.545
Christ.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.969
Any sign of him?

47:23.257 --> 47:26.056
- No.
- [Thuds]

47:37.772 --> 47:40.116
Well, I guess you forgot
his collections, huh?

47:41.650 --> 47:43.493
Is this amusing to you?

47:45.029 --> 47:46.372
Come.

47:46.655 --> 47:49.078
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

47:53.412 --> 47:54.412
[Door creaks]

47:54.538 --> 47:55.664
We're so stupid.

47:55.956 --> 47:59.005
It's the door
banging against the frame.

47:59.293 --> 48:00.715
Okay.

48:02.546 --> 48:04.264
Let's go to the conservatory.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.550
That's where the painting is.

48:22.691 --> 48:25.319
Everything's the same.

48:25.611 --> 48:27.534
That just leaves
the basement to check.

48:27.822 --> 48:31.247
Maybe he doubled back on us
and snuck down there.

48:31.534 --> 48:32.706
Let's go.

49:00.563 --> 49:01.563
[Sniffs]

49:01.730 --> 49:04.904
Oh, what's that smell'?

49:05.192 --> 49:06.489
Mold and mildew most likely.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.155
I haven't been
in this room in ages.

49:09.447 --> 49:10.966
Gerald wouldn't be
caught dead in here.

49:10.990 --> 49:12.676
He wouldn't be able
to locate his cigarettes

49:12.700 --> 49:14.452
or drinks in the dark.

49:14.743 --> 49:17.041
Or read
his precious French poetry.

49:17.329 --> 49:18.529
What's that poet's name again?

49:18.581 --> 49:19.941
He doesn't have
to read Baudelaire,

49:19.999 --> 49:22.172
he's got it all memorized.

49:35.014 --> 49:37.893
I'll see you downstairs,
when you're dressed.

49:38.184 --> 49:39.231
Dressed?

49:39.518 --> 49:40.770
- Mm.
- What?

49:41.061 --> 49:42.654
You don't like my t-shirt?

49:42.938 --> 49:46.112
You're gonna get cold with that.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.153
Just give me some time
to make dinner.

50:36.450 --> 50:40.000
Wow, you overdid yourself here.

50:40.287 --> 50:43.416
What'?
Is it too much for you?

50:43.707 --> 50:46.005
I guess not.

50:46.293 --> 50:49.046
What shall we do
for the rest of the night?

50:49.338 --> 50:51.591
I don't know.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.351
Not cards.
How about backgammon?

50:54.635 --> 50:57.013
It's the only game I'm good at.

50:59.306 --> 51:02.230
I don't wanna play
any more games.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.068
[Giggles]

51:18.742 --> 51:20.164
[Sighs]

52:17.176 --> 52:19.975
We know
you're still here, Gerald.

52:42.826 --> 52:44.328
[Door clanks]

52:46.622 --> 52:48.340
God, you really took your time.

52:48.624 --> 52:49.624
[Giggles]

52:49.875 --> 52:51.798
You're really paranoid,
aren't you?

52:53.253 --> 52:56.598
Are you satisfied
that Gerald's not here?

52:56.882 --> 52:59.852
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

53:00.135 --> 53:02.263
He's worked
on the painting again.

53:02.554 --> 53:04.556
I think you should come and see.

53:04.848 --> 53:05.940
Hmm.

53:06.225 --> 53:09.069
Some things are best left
to mystery.

53:11.647 --> 53:13.741
What did he change?

53:14.024 --> 53:15.947
Just come and see, he's...

53:16.235 --> 53:19.079
He's added this unhealthy...

53:20.614 --> 53:23.037
Bluish undertone to the skin.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.421
It makes you look dead.

53:31.291 --> 53:35.592
I'm tired,
very tired of his games.

53:35.879 --> 53:37.597
It's all a big game to him.

53:37.881 --> 53:40.259
And I'm bored.
Worn out.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.739
I'd rather stay here
in my room with you.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.697
[Laughs]

54:00.738 --> 54:02.240
"To roll the rock you fought

54:02.531 --> 54:05.956
takes your courage, Sisyphus.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.042
No matter what effort from us,

54:09.329 --> 54:13.630
art is long, and time is short.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.197
Far from the grave of celebrity,

54:15.461 --> 54:17.634
my heart like a muffled drum

54:17.921 --> 54:19.001
taps out
it's funeral thrum-

54:19.131 --> 54:20.131
What is this?

54:20.215 --> 54:22.638
"Toward
some lonely cemetery..."

54:25.179 --> 54:26.772
What are you saying?

54:27.055 --> 54:28.055
Quoting.

54:29.099 --> 54:31.727
I'm quoting Baudelaire.

54:32.019 --> 54:34.067
What is this?

54:34.354 --> 54:35.526
You're crazy.

54:37.357 --> 54:40.156
I can't stay here.

54:40.444 --> 54:42.117
I don't get it.

54:42.404 --> 54:43.997
You're fucking with me,
aren't you?

54:44.281 --> 54:45.703
Gerald, and you too.

54:45.991 --> 54:47.163
You're all fucking with me.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.970
Oh, my god,
I can't stay here, this is...

54:48.994 --> 54:50.496
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a Gerald.

54:50.788 --> 54:53.541
I don't know
where Gerald is, okay?

54:53.832 --> 54:56.005
He's downstairs,
or upstairs or somewhere.

54:56.293 --> 54:58.512
I don't know.
Fuck.

55:04.092 --> 55:07.813
"Your bombs, knives, victory marches.
Public feasts.

your furnished rooms,

your gardens full of sighs
and intrigue.

Your churches vomiting prayer
as music.

55:17.439 --> 55:20.784

mad hags' games.

Your discouragements.

And your fireworks,
eruptions of joy

and gloomy sky smile.

and your flouted laws.

Your proud monuments
on which mists catch.

No, please stay.

55:52.099 --> 55:54.099
At least before you go,
let's look at the painting.

55:54.309 --> 55:55.686
That's what you wanted, right?

55:55.978 --> 55:58.777
Please. Please.

56:00.190 --> 56:01.612
It's okay.

56:01.900 --> 56:03.573
It's okay, let's...

56:03.861 --> 56:06.660
We'll just look
at the painting, okay?

56:06.947 --> 56:08.369
Fine. Fine.

56:09.449 --> 56:10.496
Okay.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.630
Maybe the painting
is just changing

56:23.922 --> 56:25.595
by itself?

56:29.469 --> 56:31.096
- [Giggles]
- It's not funny.

56:35.350 --> 56:36.397
Let me get some wine

56:36.685 --> 56:39.859
and we can sit in front
of the painting

56:40.147 --> 56:42.400
and see what happens.

56:44.484 --> 56:45.764
Or at least we can wait together

56:45.861 --> 56:46.861
until Gerald comes back.

56:47.112 --> 56:50.707
If...
In case Gerald comes back.

56:56.246 --> 56:58.214
I'll be right back.

56:58.498 --> 57:00.000
Wait.

57:13.096 --> 57:15.474
This is ridiculous,
it's fucking ridiculous.

58:15.117 --> 58:16.960
[Beth] Hey, you've reached
Beth's voicemail.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.244
Leave a message...

58:30.549 --> 58:32.472
Or do you want something else?

58:32.759 --> 58:34.602
Vodka? Whiskey?

58:34.886 --> 58:36.684
Absinth e?

59:01.288 --> 59:04.337
Just be straight with me,
what's going on?

59:09.463 --> 59:11.966
Let's have a glass of wine
and I'll explain.

59:21.266 --> 59:23.485
Everything's all right.

59:23.769 --> 59:25.487
I promise.

59:26.563 --> 59:27.906
So, explain.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.618
- I'm waiting.
- Okay.

59:32.903 --> 59:34.496
I'll explain.

59:44.247 --> 59:45.464
Andrew came...

59:45.749 --> 59:47.968
I mean, Gerald came

59:48.251 --> 59:50.049
while you were looking for him.

59:53.673 --> 59:54.799
You're not serious.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.435
- No.
- Why are you joking?

59:56.718 --> 59:58.265
No, I'm not.
Huh...

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.442
Let's play cards or backgammon.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:06.729
We'll loosen up
and I'll tell you everything.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.524
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:14.286
Everything is great.
Better than great.

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:15.741
I'm not so sure.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:17.656
You put the game out.
You wanted to play.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.576
So, let's play.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:28.797
I think I should leave.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.212
Okay, then leave.

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.778
[Shivering]

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.276
What are you doing?
Stop!

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.990
[Panting]

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.972
God, why did you come back?

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:02.144
You should've just left.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:03.644
Is it deep?

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.897
[Water trinkling]

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:17.943
Who did those other ones?

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:21.030
Me.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.957
Why would you
do this to yourself?

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.602
You shouldn't have
come back like that

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:34.755
without knocking or...

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:38.884
Let me do it.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.755
Because of Gerald.

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:29.557
Why did you put up with him?

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.935
Who are you to pass judgment?

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:37.731
I'm just asking.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:46.532
Will you get me
my glass of wine, please.

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:52.587
Sure.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.757
You promise me
you won't do that again?

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:00.886
I won't.

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:59.316
I'm making some coffee.
Would you like some?

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.698
I want a lot.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.324
Yeah, I'll have a cup.

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:15.065
So why'd you do that
to yourself?

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:20.170
I suppose we all give the best
of our hearts

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.269
uncritically to those
who hardly think about us

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:24.091
in return.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.307
T.H. White.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.938
Why would you
cut yourself for him?

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:45.943
Blood.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:49.450
Life.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:52.035
To feel alive.

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:54.914
To feel something.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.249
To feel in control of something.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.920
Gerald took that away from me.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.553
Control.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.007
He's a painter.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:13.220
Me though, [Giggles].

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.733
I don't wanna
talk about that anymore.

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:25.531
Tell me about yourself.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.822
There's not much to tell.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:35.955
I mean, you're the one

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.210
with the interesting life here.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:40.247
You've been places, done things.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:44.335
Traveling doesn't mean
you necessarily see things

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:45.551
or learn anything.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:12.950
Miranda...

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.953
I know
this is probably bad timing...

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.794
- Yeah?
- But...

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:27.919
I'd like to get us
something else.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.633
Other than wine.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.006
I'd offer you pork,

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:35.427
but I don't think
there's any left.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.265
Oh, we should drink
something harder,

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.806
with a little punch.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:41.475
How about some vodka?

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:42.892
Absinthe?

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:46.859
I've never had absinthe, but no.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:50.650
Aw, don't be stupid.

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.320
Never had absinthe.
Mm.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:56.034
Miss, you shall be...

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.574
Educated.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:07:59.037
[Water splashes]

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.332
Here.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:07.213
You take this.
I'll take the knife.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.500
Why the knife?

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.220
In case we have
unwanted visitors.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.802
Besides, I like the shiny object

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.262
that shines.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:16.893
[Giggles]

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:20.805
Gerald used to say things
like that.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.564
Sometimes he was funny.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.694
Gerald introduced me to it.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.948
And he had to drink it,
because Baudelaire did.

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:32.529
But I came to love it

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.990
because Ernest Dowson drank it.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:38.785
- Who's that?
- Mm.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:44.167
He was a decadent poet
who drank himself to death

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.332
at the unripe, young age of 33.

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:10.776
[Gasps]

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.951
[Panting]

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.755
Before" on second thought,
I wanted to ask you

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.917
if we could play one last game.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.926
Backgammon.
Just one game.

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.938
If you win, I'll let you
keep the paintings...

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.010
I told you
I don't want the paintings

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.551
or anything that I want
from Gerald.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.219
Me?

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.854
You want me?

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.023
[Giggles]

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:47.899
They're your paintings now.

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.301
Well, it doesn't matter anyway

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:51.988
because he took them.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.648
Right?

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:57.114
Yes.
I think so.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.141
Well, they're not there anymore,

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:01.785
so somebody
must have taken them.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:04.542
Ugh, do you wanna play or not?

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:06.373
Just one game.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.164
Then afterwards
we will forget everything.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:12.709
Mm. But I really want
some more absinthe.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.627
Come on, let's go.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:27.603
There are lots of rituals
associated with absinthe.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.062
Rituals?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.652
What kind of rituals?

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:40.031
Well, I only drink it
when I'm already drunk.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:41.571
Or hungover.

01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:44.582
And I pour it in a proportion
of four to one.

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.210
And it's best drunk in bed.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:48.585
Why in bed?

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:51.214
Because it affects
my ability to stand up.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.257
If I collapse,
then probably more comfortable

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.009
if I'm already lying in bed.

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:07.851
You're gonna carry
that knife around...

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.187
- The whole night?
- Yes.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:11.475
Well...

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:14.980
You want me to, right?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:20.026
And the absinthe too,
the whole night.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:22.787
Oh, do you want one?

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.071
A knife?

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:26.491
No, I'm okay.
Thanks, I...

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.223
I trust you to protect me,
it's okay.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.416
[Laughs]

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.421
Ahh, I love backgammon.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.255
Especially
because Gerald hated it.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:40.843
It's simple but who cares?

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.053
[Sighs]

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.341
Now, I only set it out
because I was tired of poker

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.354
and I wanted to change games
in case Gerald came back,

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:50.515
but...

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:52.434
Well, anyway.
Let's just play.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:53.827
We only have to play one game.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:54.851
If you win,

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.205
you can keep everything you won.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.946
- If I win...
- [Groans]

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:58.230
I keep it.

01:11:58.356 --> 01:11:59.482
I told you, I don't care.

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.321
I don't care.

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:05.075
Let's play.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:42.321
[Laughs]
I won.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:43.608
Yes.

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.325
I won.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.325
- Well, I know that.
- I won! I won.

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.664
I won, I won, I won, I won.

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:53.952
I won.

01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:56.163
[Laughs]
You-...

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.630
One more.

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.298
Double or quits.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.893
[Laughs]

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:16.150
You idiot.
Get out.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.396
That was... that was good.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.446
I have to make a confession.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:28.955
Mm.
A confession.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.866
I was the one that took
all the paintings.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:34.752
He disfigured me
in so many ways...

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:38.916
Distorted studies of me,
distorted...

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:41.129
So many unfinished pictures
of me.

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:49.433
And what about
the changing picture?

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.010
[Miranda]
Blurry.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.477
Representational,
but not representation.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.863
I'm the painter.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.410
And what about him?

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:12.164
He ls not.
He ls... he is [Snorts].

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.667
Gerald's not coming back.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.628
It's all yours now.

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:20.999
What do you mean,
you're the painter?

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.963
I'm the painter.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.469
Gerald, no, no, no.
No!

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:27.596
Absolutely, no!

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:29.720
No.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:25.797
You're not gonna do
anything stupid

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:27.406
with that knife again, are you?

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:36.040
I'm better than ever.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.296
Don't worry.

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:53.800
Let's go to bed.

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:02.691
[Moans]

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.068
[Moaning continues]

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:40.809
That's me.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.564
And all th ese pictures
are mine.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.990
Remember I won them back,
so I brought them out.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:53.947
It's true.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.164
They are mine.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:04.871
I've painted them.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:09.208
And I've won them back from you.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.927
So, you painted all of these.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:24.265
Yes.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.861
[Chuckles]
He didn't know how to paint.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.490
He painted some
but not very well.

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:35.196
For instance,
this piece of shit was his.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:36.531
I was trying to change it,

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.992
but it was so bad
I couldn't do it.

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:44.827
[Chuckles]

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.002
This does look different.

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:58.091
It does remind me
of the one in your bedroom.

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:05.643
It's like a new you.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.249
Let's go have breakfast.

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:39.966
I like your robe.

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:41.725
Gerald bought it for me.

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:44.888
It's meant to have belonged
to queen Victoria.

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:46.556
Oh. Really?

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:49.726
No, probably not.
No.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:58.821
So, Gerald...

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:02.131
Why did he pretend about
the exhibition

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.660
and the paintings?

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:07.789
Guess what?

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.250
Game over.

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.960
I'm the fucking painter!

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:15.918
You don't...

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:26.686
Forget it.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.116
I need a cigarette.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:50.120
I'm going to go outside
for a minute.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:20.031
Miranda?

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.109
Miranda?

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:07.363
Miranda?

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:28.224
There you are.

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:30.307
[Miranda]
<i>I</i> need to show you something.

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.149
[Lucian]
Show me what?

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:41.030
I didn't have the courage
to go look

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:44.863
until I saw you there with me.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.575
I got the courage
to come and see.

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:53.201
See what?

01:21:56.537 --> 01:21:57.817
Miranda,
is everything all right?

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:01.008
We fought, he hit me,
I tried to escape.

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.339
He hit me, but I got him back.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:05.629
He was really drunk with a rock.

01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:08.090
Is that...
Oh, my...

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:11.101
Oh, shit.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:19.143
No, no, no, oh, my...

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.108
I don't feel good.

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.657
I don't think...

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:31.989
I don't feel good.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:52.347
Huh, I didn't know that
I had killed him until now.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.679
Until...
[Panting]

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.815
Until I... I finally
found the courage

01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:01.898
- to come and see for myself.
- What the...

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.608
What happened? What?

01:23:05.772 --> 01:23:09.242
I fantasized that maybe
had not killed him.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:10.652
That maybe he escaped

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:14.699
but he was still fucking drunk.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:17.584
It made it easy.

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.666
What are you gonna do?
I mean...

01:23:21.455 --> 01:23:22.735
You have to get him out of here.

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:24.170
No. No...
[Stammers]

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:25.801
Nobody's gonna find him here.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.301
That house is abandoned.
Nobody comes.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.841
We used to pretend like,
like we were little kids

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:33.304
and like, we had two houses.

01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:35.515
[Laughs]

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:41.726
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.985
Let's go finish up
what we started.

01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:47.109
- Finish up what?
Breakfast.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:48.614
Remember?

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:54.868
I just saw a dead body,
you think I'm fucking hungry?

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:59.369
I'm out of here.
You're...

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:00.707
You're on your own.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.909
[♪♪]

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:47.671
