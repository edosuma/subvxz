WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.208
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.010
sexually based offenses

00:10.010 --> 00:11.879
are considered especially
heinous.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.382
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.382 --> 00:16.150
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.685
are members of an elite squad

00:17.685 --> 00:19.720
known as the
Special Victims Unit.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.489
These are their stories.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.993
- Yeah, I'll be there
tomorrow morning.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.195
No, no, no.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.330
After eight weeks
of maternity leave,

00:29.330 --> 00:31.599
I'm definitely ready
to come back.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.634
How have you been doing after

00:33.634 --> 00:35.269
everything you went through?

00:35.269 --> 00:37.238
- Oh, I'm fine, Rollins.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.339
Thank you for asking.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.641
Don't--don't worry about me.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.111
Look, we are all very much
looking forward

00:43.111 --> 00:44.178
to seeing you tomorrow.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.314
- Yeah, all right.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.416
Um, thanks, Lieutenant.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.617
- You think I don't
know anything

00:49.617 --> 00:51.319
about your whore tricks?

00:51.319 --> 00:52.553
Shut up.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.255
Are you lying to me?

00:54.255 --> 00:56.390
I can tell right now
that you're lying to me.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.626
I will get on a bus
and be there by morning,

00:58.626 --> 01:00.128
and I will toss him
out the window

01:00.128 --> 01:01.195
and kick your ass.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.331
What are you looking at?

01:03.331 --> 01:05.333
[growls]
What did you say?

01:05.333 --> 01:07.901
Don't talk back to me.
I know you were with him.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.237
You're gonna be sorry.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.439
- Yeah?

01:11.439 --> 01:13.741
Yeah.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.976
[indistinct chattering]

01:15.976 --> 01:17.945
Hmm.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.818
[inhales sharply]

01:24.818 --> 01:26.554
Mm.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.791
[sighs]

01:33.060 --> 01:35.529
- See?
[laughs]

01:35.529 --> 01:37.365
- [laughs]
Follow me.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.167
Yo, check it.
- That girl is wasted.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.935
- Come on.
- Maybe she could use a friend.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.772
- Yo.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.540
What's up, babe?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.209
Hey, girl,
what you got in that bag?

01:48.209 --> 01:51.612
Now, where you get that?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.248
What's up, babe?

01:54.248 --> 01:57.185
- What's your name, girl?
- Hey, stop.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.319
- Guys, people are looking.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.820
- Just want to have
some fun with you.

01:59.820 --> 02:00.921
- You want to share with us,
right?

02:00.921 --> 02:03.424
- Oh, I'm all out.
- Come on, baby.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.193
- Oh, oh!
- Oh.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.860
- We should get
out of here, man.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.397
- You know what?
That's a great idea.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.632
Come on, let's get
this lady home.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.434
Yeah, come on, baby.

02:13.434 --> 02:16.737
Come on.
Take her purse.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.105
Let's go.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.208
I've got you.
Come on.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.343
Let's go, it's cool.
Easy now.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.777
- [moaning]
Let go of me.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.813
- It's cool, I got you.
- Ooh, we 'gon get you home.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.818
[overlapping chatter]

02:30.818 --> 02:33.221
[woman muttering indistinctly]

02:33.221 --> 02:36.224
[dramatic music]

02:36.224 --> 02:37.691
*

02:37.691 --> 02:39.227
Yo, my friend, she, uh--

02:39.227 --> 02:41.662
she just partied too much,
that's all.

02:41.662 --> 02:46.634
*

02:46.634 --> 02:49.637
- Hold her.
- [grunts]

02:49.637 --> 02:51.939
Check her bag. Check her purse.
Get her keys.

02:51.939 --> 02:55.008
Come on. Be quiet.
This one. This one.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.744
Give me the keys.
Hurry.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.111
- Come on.
- Just--

02:58.111 --> 02:59.680
- Come on!
Come on, be quiet!

02:59.680 --> 03:01.482
- Quiet.
- Hey, what are you guys doing?

03:01.482 --> 03:03.150
Who are you?
- Let's go.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.585
- You don't live here.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.455
- Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go.
- Yeah, yeah, you better run.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.023
Yeah, I'll call the police.
[door to building closes]

03:10.023 --> 03:12.393
- Shh!

03:12.393 --> 03:13.761
- Hold her.
- What are you doing?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.429
Let her go.
- Relax.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.499
- Yo, yo, yo, you ain't
never seen one like this.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.968
I'ma tell you.
- [laughing]

03:20.968 --> 03:22.870
- That ain't right.
- Easy. Easy, just relax.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.273
Just relax.
Okay?

03:25.273 --> 03:28.709
- Yeah, you like that?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.278
- [gasps]
No, no, no!

03:30.278 --> 03:33.747
[screaming]

03:33.747 --> 03:35.283
- Shut up, shut up!
You want to get loud?

03:35.283 --> 03:36.484
- Help!
- She gonna get loud!

03:36.484 --> 03:38.519
[indistinct shouting]

03:38.519 --> 03:40.921
*

03:40.921 --> 03:43.757
- I said hold her back.
You're acting like a bitch.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.360
[shuffling, panting]

03:46.360 --> 03:49.363
[overlapping voices]

03:49.363 --> 03:52.933
- [groaning]
No, no!

03:52.933 --> 03:54.602
- I want the jacket.
Open the jacket.

03:54.602 --> 04:02.476
*

04:02.476 --> 04:04.345
[siren wailing]

04:04.345 --> 04:07.147
- We've got head wounds,
signs of sexual assault.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.349
- Yeah, welcome back, right?

04:08.349 --> 04:09.683
- Yeah.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.486
- Hey, honey.
Can you hear me?

04:12.486 --> 04:15.389
Can you squeeze my hand?
- [moans]

04:15.389 --> 04:16.624
- That's good.
That's good.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.825
- Hey, we got to move.
She's hypothermic.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.660
- Okay, how long was she
out in the cold--all night?

04:19.660 --> 04:20.694
- Most likely.
We got to go.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.695
- Okay.
- I'll ride along.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.696
- Great.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.332
- The vic is Libby Parker,

04:24.332 --> 04:25.599
apartment B11.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.667
Super found her
in the courtyard,

04:26.667 --> 04:27.668
7:00 a.m.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.337
- Anyone get eyes on the perp?

04:29.337 --> 04:32.340
- No video.
No one's come forward.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.875
- Guys, there's
100 windows up there.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.810
Somebody saw something.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.884
[dramatic music]

05:27.428 --> 05:27.561
.

05:28.862 --> 05:29.296
- She ate that much?

05:31.064 --> 05:34.201
Okay, there is, uh,
more milk in the freezer.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.870
Right.
I told you that, of course.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.839
All right,
I'll check in with you soon.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.408
Okay, thanks.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.543
Dr. Wilder,
can I talk to Libby now?

05:42.543 --> 05:45.546
- Not yet. She has a concussion,
two cracked ribs--

05:45.546 --> 05:46.814
between that,
the hypothermia,

05:46.814 --> 05:47.848
and the drugs
in her system,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.317
we're still trying
to stabilize her.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.558
- It's all clear in here.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.927
- Doesn't look like a robbery.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.729
- All right, Freddy,

06:01.729 --> 06:03.063
I'm gonna need names
of every tenant

06:03.063 --> 06:04.965
that faces the courtyard.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.900
- I'll make a list.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.636
- No men's clothes.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.472
- Yeah, well, someone
was in her life.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.542
Looks like, uh, kids.
Maybe nieces.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.710
[knock at door]
- Officers,

06:16.710 --> 06:17.845
is the lady all right?

06:17.845 --> 06:19.680
- No. Who are you?
You live here?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.782
- Yeah, yeah.
I live across the hall.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.452
- Were you around last night?
- Yeah.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.019
Actually, I saw two guys

06:26.019 --> 06:27.688
try to break in here
around 1:00 a.m.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.756
They had keys.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.290
- Was it anybody
you ever seen before?

06:30.290 --> 06:32.460
- No.
Younger than her boyfriends.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.295
They were Spanish, maybe.
- You call the police?

06:35.295 --> 06:38.031
- No, I yelled at them,
and they ran away.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.800
- You hear anything
after that?

06:39.800 --> 06:43.471
- No, I, uh,
had my headphones on.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.605
What happened?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.808
- That poor girl.
I saw the ambulance.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.243
- Did you hear anything
last night?

06:50.243 --> 06:52.045
- There was something going on.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.246
- In the courtyard?
- Yes.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.048
I went to the window.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.650
She was out there
with some men.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.051
- Can you describe them?

06:58.051 --> 06:59.720
- They were wearing hoodies.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.188
I couldn't really see.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.724
- Did you hear her screams?

07:03.724 --> 07:06.059
Then why didn't you
call the police?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.528
- Lots of lights were on.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.363
I figured somebody else
had called already.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.765
- We know Libby.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.134
She lives right below us.
always smoking at her window.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.769
- Craig,
the woman was attacked.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.104
I told you she was screaming.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.371
- You heard screams?

07:18.371 --> 07:20.608
- You said you heard a noise.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.275
By the time I checked,
it was quiet.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.511
- And you didn't see anything?

07:23.511 --> 07:25.646
She was lying in that
courtyard all night.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.949
- It was dark.
You couldn't see a thing.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.586
- So at least 10 residents
saw or heard an assault.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.322
- Everybody thought someone else
was calling the cops.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.090
- Police could've been here
in two minutes.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.425
Now this woman might die.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.260
- I agree, so let's take it easy
with the witnesses.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.695
We want them to cooperate.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.664
- Hey, you can't go in there.
- I got to get my dog.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.967
- Hey.
[dog whimpering]

07:46.967 --> 07:49.136
- Hey, that's a cute puppy.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.171
- Hey, thanks.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.372
- You walk her
through here a lot?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.074
- Um, well, I don't take her
out on the street.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.643
There are a lot of big dogs
in the neighborhood.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.712
- Hey, I'm not ASPCA.
I'm NYPD, all right?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.213
So you walk her
through here last night?

08:00.213 --> 08:01.849
- Last night?
No.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.417
- Did you, uh, hear anything
in the courtyard?

08:04.417 --> 08:05.686
- Um, no.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.388
I'm sorry, I--
I wasn't home last night.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.758
I was at a bar
with my boyfriend.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.862
- Okay, thanks.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.296
You know what?

08:16.296 --> 08:17.665
Say what you want
about Staten Island,

08:17.665 --> 08:19.633
but at least they have people
who look out for each other.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.901
- We caught a break.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.169
Libby used her debit card

08:22.169 --> 08:24.404
in the East Village last night
at 11:00 p.m.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.476
- You seen this woman?

08:29.476 --> 08:31.344
How about you?
You see this woman last night?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.713
- Hey, buddy,
what about you?

08:32.713 --> 08:34.815
- That girl was high as a kite.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.249
- She get her drugs here?

08:36.249 --> 08:38.351
- There are no drugs here.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.088
We have cameras.
Keeps them away.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.590
- Okay, how about you
show me the footage

08:42.590 --> 08:43.691
from last night?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.626
- The system only saves
the last hour.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.927
The data slows down the server,

08:46.927 --> 08:48.495
which makes the gamers angry.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.697
- All right.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.932
Anyone seen this woman
last night?

08:51.932 --> 08:54.702
Or at any time at all?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.837
No?

08:56.837 --> 08:59.607
Anyone like bologna sandwiches?

08:59.607 --> 09:02.676
[overlapping chatter]

09:04.511 --> 09:06.880
Hey, you go to Fordham,
don't you?

09:06.880 --> 09:10.183
- Uh, yeah.
Do I know you?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.619
- Yeah, maybe.
I'm in night school there.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.853
Listen, you think your
midterms are hard,

09:12.853 --> 09:14.254
wait till you get to the Bar.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.756
- [laughing]

09:15.756 --> 09:19.627
- You, uh--you see
this woman last night?

09:19.627 --> 09:20.828
- Yes.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.895
Look, if this is
about the drugs,

09:21.895 --> 09:23.196
then I don't know anything,
okay?

09:23.196 --> 09:25.365
- She was assaulted.

09:25.365 --> 09:29.637
So if you saw anything,
give me a call.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.538
Okay, you too, huh?

09:31.538 --> 09:35.643
Nobody saw anything,
all night long?

09:35.643 --> 09:36.644
[snaps fingers]

09:36.644 --> 09:37.878
All right, great.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.647
Thanks for your
cooperation, people.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.548
Appreciate it.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.216
- The cafe's a drug den.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.517
No one saw a thing.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.319
- Still, her building--

09:46.319 --> 09:48.388
I mean, how many people
face that courtyard?

09:48.388 --> 09:50.223
- This one says his
window was closed.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.659
That one says she
went to bed early.

09:51.659 --> 09:52.726
- Bystander effect.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.262
Sometimes, the more witnesses,
the less help.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.563
- Yeah, and no help from
the family, either.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.998
I found an ex-husband
in Detroit.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.667
He has sole custody
of their daughters,

09:59.667 --> 10:01.401
and he was quick to tell me
that she's a junkie.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.502
- Terrific.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.504
- Does he know that
she's in the hospital?

10:04.504 --> 10:05.806
- He didn't seem too concerned.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.507
- Hey, Lieutenant.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.777
Sorry I'm late, but not only
did that girl from the cafe

10:09.777 --> 10:11.712
see Libby with three guys
the other night,

10:11.712 --> 10:13.313
but she got it on video.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.985
- Great work, Carisi.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.586
Try facial recognition

10:19.586 --> 10:22.289
and get this to every
TV station in the city.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.395
- I saw the video on the news.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.596
I'm pretty sure those boys

10:29.596 --> 10:30.698
are from our youth center.

10:30.698 --> 10:31.965
- We appreciate your help.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.566
Who are they?

10:33.566 --> 10:36.904
Ronnie Ellis, Juan Flores,
and William Reeves.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.739
Ronnie and Juan are hardcore,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.041
but Will--
he surprised me, though.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.810
He's been trying
to straighten out.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.344
- Aren't they locked in
at night?

10:44.344 --> 10:45.846
- They're supposed to be.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.815
We've been having issues
with the night guards.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.282
- And where are they now?

10:49.282 --> 10:50.583
- Told them to wait
in the game room.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.691
[dramatic music]

10:57.691 --> 11:02.562
*

11:12.773 --> 11:12.906
.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.075
- Bobby, you said you don't
know where your bunkies went,

11:16.309 --> 11:18.378
but do you mind
if we look around?

11:18.378 --> 11:20.613
- Do they have cell phones?
- Old ones.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.650
- So no GPS.
How about social media?

11:23.650 --> 11:24.752
- Of course.

11:24.752 --> 11:25.853
They don't have data plans
for texting,

11:25.853 --> 11:27.520
so they communicate
via Twitter and Facebook.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.756
- There's nothing here.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.023
- We're gonna need
their account names.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.025
- I'll get you what I can,
but they all use street names

11:32.025 --> 11:34.762
on multiple accounts.

11:34.762 --> 11:37.765
- Did they have friends here?
- Not really.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.433
Ronnie's been kicked out
of three shelters.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.770
Juan came from an abusive
foster family,

11:42.770 --> 11:44.905
and Will was rescued from

11:44.905 --> 11:46.940
a sex trafficking ring.

11:46.940 --> 11:50.077
- And they run as a pack?
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.379
- Okay, Linda, these boys
are in trouble.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.646
Where would they hide?

11:53.646 --> 11:56.349
- Back on the street.
- Dealing?

11:56.349 --> 11:59.853
- Ronnie and Juan for sure,
but Will...

11:59.853 --> 12:02.856
he was picked up last year
for solicitation.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.959
Brooklyn.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.962
[dramatic music]

12:08.962 --> 12:17.004
*

12:19.807 --> 12:21.809
- Got to be a tough way
to make a living.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.376
- Once they hit the streets,

12:23.376 --> 12:26.446
half these runaways are hooking
within a couple days.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.817
*

12:29.817 --> 12:31.819
- Right there.
Right there.

12:31.819 --> 12:34.822
[siren wailing]

12:34.822 --> 12:35.823
Will Reeves,

12:35.823 --> 12:36.857
hands in the air--right now.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.826
Right now.
- Hey, New Jersey--

12:38.826 --> 12:41.628
- Move the car.
Get out of here.

12:41.628 --> 12:49.636
*

12:49.636 --> 12:51.338
- That's you, Will.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.706
Social worker says the other two
are bad news.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.976
She's disappointed you
got caught up.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.579
- I didn't hurt that lady,
I swear.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.649
- Okay, Will.
Somebody did.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.985
Somebody dragged her
to a building,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.519
raped her,

13:06.519 --> 13:07.754
and left her for dead
in the courtyard.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.889
- I'll telling you--

13:08.889 --> 13:10.858
- We have witnesses who
saw the whole thing.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.159
- I'm telling you,
it wasn't me.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.694
- You just the fall guy?
It's all on Ronnie and Juan?

13:14.694 --> 13:16.729
- Yeah, that's right.
- We can work with that.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.032
Where are they?
- I don't know.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.734
They out hustling.
- Okay, so DM them.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.571
- No way.
Ronnie will kill me.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.373
I can't. Please.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.141
Can I just talk to Linda?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.010
- You got to talk to us first.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.979
- This kid's wetting the bed.
He's no thug.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.513
- Look, we have Will's phone.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.748
If he won't contact his friends,
we're gonna do it for him.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.084
- I'll get a warrant for
social media accounts

13:37.084 --> 13:38.085
on all three.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.486
- Good news.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.221
Libby's doctor says
she just came to.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.756
- Great. Let's just hope she
remembers what happened to her.

13:43.756 --> 13:44.992
- Yeah, the last thing
we want to do

13:44.992 --> 13:47.060
is rely on our
see-no-evil witnesses.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.466
- The doctor said
I've been out of it

13:53.466 --> 13:55.135
for over two days now.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.038
- Yeah.
You almost died.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.174
Libby, is there anybody
that we could call for you?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.911
- Um, no.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.947
Not really.
- Okay.

14:06.947 --> 14:10.317
Libby, you were
found unconscious

14:10.317 --> 14:12.219
in the courtyard.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.923
Do you have any idea
how you got there?

14:15.923 --> 14:18.258
- Everything's fuzzy.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.027
- You had a concussion.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.561
- And they also found alcohol

14:21.561 --> 14:23.730
and ketamine in your system.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.798
- Please don't say anything
to my ex-husband.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.534
Please.
I was trying to do better.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.769
- He doesn't need to know,

14:29.769 --> 14:31.538
but, Libby,
you were attacked.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.673
You were beaten

14:33.673 --> 14:36.609
and possibly
sexually assaulted.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.946
Remember anything at all?

14:40.847 --> 14:44.217
- I remember pavement
on my back

14:44.217 --> 14:48.455
and being so cold.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.223
[somber music]

14:50.223 --> 14:53.093
I was floating outside
of my body, like--

14:53.093 --> 14:55.062
like a bad dream.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.164
- And what about
your attackers?

14:57.164 --> 15:00.667
Do you remember what they
looked like or sounded like?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.735
- No. No.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.704
- Okay,
so how about we go back

15:04.704 --> 15:06.739
to the last thing
that you do remember?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.641
*

15:08.641 --> 15:10.777
- I was having a bad night.
- Okay.

15:10.777 --> 15:14.781
- So I had more than
a few drinks at the bar.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.984
Then I went to the cafe
to get coffee

15:16.984 --> 15:20.153
and, you know,
sober up.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.289
That's when this guy offered--

15:22.289 --> 15:23.991
offered me Special K.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.993
*

15:25.993 --> 15:28.661
I--I was stupid.

15:28.661 --> 15:32.332
- All right.
Okay.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.567
Do you recognize any
of these guys?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.003
You can scroll through.

15:36.003 --> 15:39.539
*

15:39.539 --> 15:40.840
- No.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.010
Why, did some of them
do this to me?

15:43.010 --> 15:45.678
- All we know is what
we've seen from a video.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.647
Three of them
did surround you

15:47.647 --> 15:50.317
there at the cafe,
and you all left together.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.684
- We did?

15:51.684 --> 15:53.253
- Yeah, you don't--

15:53.253 --> 15:55.922
you don't recall that?
[clears throat]

15:55.922 --> 15:58.225
They took you back
to your apartment.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.627
- Did I invite them back?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.262
- Well, they had your keys

16:02.262 --> 16:04.297
and they were trying to
get into your apartment,

16:04.297 --> 16:07.334
and they got scared off,
so...

16:07.334 --> 16:11.138
then they must have
assaulted you in the courtyard.

16:11.138 --> 16:15.075
- I don't remember that...

16:15.075 --> 16:17.944
or any of them, but...

16:17.944 --> 16:19.479
if I was in the courtyard,
some--

16:19.479 --> 16:21.914
somebody must have seen
what happened to me.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.916
- We're going to speak
with all your neighbors

16:23.916 --> 16:28.888
and just trying to put
the pieces together.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.692
*

16:32.692 --> 16:35.762
Well,
her memory may come back.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.265
- Forget the head injury--
the drugs?

16:38.265 --> 16:39.766
I wouldn't count on that.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.434
- There's nothing
on the rape kit.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.869
There's not much
on that video.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.671
- Mm-mm.
- Look, we got to go back

16:44.671 --> 16:47.274
and lean on those neighbors.
- Yeah, but good luck with that.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.941
They all made it pretty clear
they don't really care for her.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.679
- Well, maybe so,
but we have to.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
- I--You know--
I know there's no such thing

16:54.681 --> 16:56.549
as a perfect vic,

16:56.549 --> 16:58.818
but this lady has got
two little girls.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.421
She's doing drugs.
God knows what else.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.824
You know how hard it is for
a woman to lose custody?

17:04.824 --> 17:06.593
- Addiction is addiction,
Rollins.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.528
- Yeah, but she's got kids.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.263
You don't get to make those
kind of mistakes anymore.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.431
- Okay.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.532
- I mean, it's just not
her life to ruin.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.900
- I hear you.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.002
Hold on.
We have a lead.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.737
Ronnie just DM'ed Juan.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.839
They're moving some weed
out on Atlantic avenue.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.842
[dramatic music]

17:22.842 --> 17:24.311
*

17:24.311 --> 17:26.346
- Excuse me.
Hey, excuse me.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.880
Have you seen these two?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.117
Hello?

17:30.117 --> 17:33.753
Excuse me, have you
seen these two at all?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.322
- You got anything?
- No, I got nothing.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.424
- All right, no sign of them.
Any luck over there?

17:37.424 --> 17:40.227
- We just pulled up.
Nothing yet.

17:40.227 --> 17:48.268
*

17:49.602 --> 17:52.372
- Hey, excuse me, guys.
NYPD.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.506
Did you buy that around here?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.342
- It's medicinal.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.544
- Uh-huh, okay.
Where did you get it?

17:57.544 --> 17:59.346
- Over there, by the subway.

17:59.346 --> 18:06.653
*

18:06.653 --> 18:09.489
- I got eyes on both of them.
Atlantic and 4th Avenue.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.391
- Straight ahead!

18:11.391 --> 18:15.895
*

18:15.895 --> 18:18.198
- Oh--
Come on.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.433
- NYPD! Stop!

18:20.433 --> 18:22.735
[tense music]

18:22.735 --> 18:25.638
- Out of the way!
Move!

18:25.638 --> 18:27.774
- Yo! Over there!
Over there!

18:27.774 --> 18:29.809
Let's go!
Let's go!

18:31.544 --> 18:33.813
- Move! Move!

18:33.813 --> 18:37.450
- This way.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.585
- Oh, damn!

18:38.585 --> 18:40.553
- Police!

18:40.553 --> 18:42.189
- Yo, hop the gate!

18:42.189 --> 18:43.456
[all grunting]

18:43.456 --> 18:45.392
- Arms behind your back!

18:45.392 --> 18:47.260
Arms behind your back!
- You're under arrest.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.795
- [groans]
Ah, man.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.829
- I don't have anything.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.300
- Shut up!
Don't talk!

18:53.300 --> 18:55.402
- Okay, get them
out of here, guys. Now.

18:55.402 --> 18:58.638
*

18:58.638 --> 19:00.307
Good job.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.475
Come on, guys, move along.
Move it.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.511
- What you looking at, man?

19:04.511 --> 19:06.213
- Thanks a lot, people.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.114
No, thank you.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.317
Citizens of New York,
I applaud you.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.219
Give yourselves a hand.

19:19.259 --> 19:19.392
.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.361
- Come on.
I'm staying out of trouble.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.733
- Is that why you ran?
- You people were chasing me.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.801
- Where were you
Wednesday night, Juan?

19:28.801 --> 19:31.238
- I'm not sure.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.340
What did Ronnie say?

19:34.607 --> 19:37.377
- Man, we met the waste case
at the cafe.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.679
All we did was try to
help her get home.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.514
- You mean you dragged her home,
beat her, and raped her.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.915
- It wasn't us.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.817
As soon as we got
right outside the cafe,

19:44.817 --> 19:47.554
she got all belligerent
and took off.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.922
- Then why do we have witnesses
that put you at her building?

19:49.922 --> 19:51.491
- That's a bluff.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.626
I saw the news.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.662
No one called 911.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.834
- Will, your friends

20:01.834 --> 20:04.304
are giving you up.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.205
- They are?

20:06.205 --> 20:09.476
- So how about you tell me
your side of the story?

20:09.476 --> 20:11.478
- Linda from the shelter--
she knows I wouldn't do--

20:11.478 --> 20:15.282
- Yeah, Linda
can't help you now, Will.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.016
Help yourself.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.851
- I didn't hurt no one.

20:18.851 --> 20:21.120
I didn't do nothing.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.999
- Where are we on these boys?
- Nowhere.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.534
Ronnie and Juan are lying
as we speak.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.202
- Well, Will wasn't
any help, either.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.804
- Ronnie had a second
cell phone on him.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.205
The call log was deleted.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.440
- Send it to TARU,
see what they find?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.174
- Yeah, and in the meantime,

20:42.174 --> 20:45.812
get a photo array
over to Libby's building.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.548
- Maybe one of our
Good Samaritans can make an ID.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.417
- Yeah.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.652
[sighs]

20:52.652 --> 20:55.221
[dramatic music]

20:55.221 --> 20:56.956
- This one.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.426
- Okay, good.
- Actually--actually, wait.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.628
*

21:01.628 --> 21:04.431
Actually, this one.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.599
Maybe both of them.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.635
- Okay, um, why don't we

21:08.635 --> 21:11.471
try the others and come back
to this group?

21:11.471 --> 21:13.473
- Just take your time,
Mrs. Weissman.

21:13.473 --> 21:17.477
*

21:17.477 --> 21:18.978
- I think he was there.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.847
*

21:20.847 --> 21:24.584
- Are you sure?
- Should I be?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.986
Am I wrong?

21:26.986 --> 21:29.456
Which one is it?

21:29.456 --> 21:30.823
- I don't recognize
any of them.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.759
- We told you.
We barely saw anything.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.893
Come on, we're late.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.495
- We still need you
to take a look.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.696
- I don't want to be involved
with a trial.

21:36.696 --> 21:37.864
- You're an eyewitness.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.799
You know the DA can
subpoena you to testify.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.168
- Do you have any idea
what this has been like?

21:42.168 --> 21:43.736
It's all over the news.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.372
People are blaming us for
what happened to Libby,

21:45.372 --> 21:48.074
claiming we don't care.
- Well, then, show you do care.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.842
Help us now.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.111
*

21:52.111 --> 21:54.046
- So no one
could ID all three?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.448
- Couple of them made one ID,

21:55.448 --> 21:57.149
but couldn't make
the other two.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.151
- Which does more
harm than good.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.653
Try harder.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.921
Counselor Henderson--

22:01.921 --> 22:04.156
- Mr. Barba, just the man
I was looking for.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.258
I got a call from
the youth center.

22:06.258 --> 22:07.594
I'm representing Will Reeves.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.896
- This isn't exactly
a civil rights case.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.398
- Will's barely 18.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.999
He's been a victim
of sex traffickers.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.434
No one's ever really
looked out for him.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.968
- Okay, which doesn't
make him innocent.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.070
We have him on video
with the victim.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.440
- Hypothetically,
if my client were present

22:20.440 --> 22:22.875
but didn't participate
in the assault in any way--

22:22.875 --> 22:24.444
- He'd still be
on the hook for rape.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.178
- Even if he were
willing to testify

22:26.178 --> 22:28.548
against the other suspects?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.883
Ronnie and Juan have records.
Robbery, drugs.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.152
- I have no way
of knowing who did what.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.422
- Will's only prior
is for solicitation.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.489
He's attending classes.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.890
He's an A student.
- Good for him.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.493
I can offer felony assault
or sexual misconduct.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.162
- You need my client's
testimony.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.597
According to
the "Daily News,"

22:44.597 --> 22:46.833
no one in the victim's
apartment building saw anything.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.900
- Okay, so which is it?

22:47.900 --> 22:49.436
He was there,
he didn't participate,

22:49.436 --> 22:50.437
or he wasn't there?

22:50.437 --> 22:51.438
What about his friends?

22:51.438 --> 22:52.872
Won't they have sob stories too?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.174
- I gave you an opportunity
to wrap this up,

22:55.174 --> 22:56.576
but if the guilty
need to walk

22:56.576 --> 22:59.011
for my client to walk,
so be it.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.183
- Lieutenant.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.553
I just heard back from TARU
about Ronnie's second cell.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.455
- Okay, any texts or photos
from that night?

23:08.455 --> 23:10.990
- No, but there was
a 911 call made from the phone

23:10.990 --> 23:12.158
around the time of the rape.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.226
Only lasts for a few seconds.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.196
- He wouldn't call the cops
on himself.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.932
- So it's not his phone.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.001
Most of the contacts
are Hispanic females.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.703
- So call them all.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.272
Tell them that you're trying
to return the phone.

23:29.976 --> 23:33.379
This is your phone,
right, Maria?

23:33.379 --> 23:35.615
- Yeah.
Thank you, uh--

23:35.615 --> 23:37.216
like I said,
I must've dropped it.

23:37.216 --> 23:40.319
- Do you remember where?
- No, I don't.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.555
- We just have
a few questions.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.090
You mind if we come in?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.396
- Was it in the building
where that woman was assaulted

23:50.396 --> 23:52.565
a few nights ago?

23:52.565 --> 23:54.033
- We read your texts,

23:54.033 --> 23:56.002
and we know that you
nanny for a family that--

23:56.002 --> 23:57.003
that lives there.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.638
- I didn't see anything.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.173
- Wow, what happened
to your eye?

24:01.173 --> 24:04.210
- [sighs] I fell.
- On your eye?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.513
- [sighs]
- Maria...

24:06.513 --> 24:10.349
you did the right thing
by calling 911.

24:10.349 --> 24:11.584
- I should not have.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.520
- Now you need to finish
what you started

24:13.520 --> 24:16.155
by telling us what you saw.

24:19.726 --> 24:23.062
- That woman was passed out.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.064
There were three boys with her.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.701
I knew something was wrong,
so I called 911.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.769
[somber music]

24:29.769 --> 24:34.574
It barely rang before
the black boy hit me.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.343
I was on the ground.
He had my phone.

24:37.343 --> 24:40.246
He said he knew who I was,
and if I called the cops

24:40.246 --> 24:43.282
that he would kill me.
- Okay.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.684
*

24:44.684 --> 24:46.586
- So I ran.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.155
- Did you get a good look
at their faces?

24:49.155 --> 24:57.196
*

25:03.670 --> 25:05.672
- Number three.

25:05.672 --> 25:13.713
*

25:19.051 --> 25:21.053
Number six.

25:21.053 --> 25:29.095
*

25:34.366 --> 25:37.136
[voice cracks]
Number two.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.439
- Thank you, Maria.
Thank you.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.108
- Ready to talk, Mr. Guthrie?

25:42.108 --> 25:45.612
*

25:45.612 --> 25:48.047
- You've got one good witness

25:48.047 --> 25:50.149
and 40 bad ones.

25:50.149 --> 25:53.085
- Maria's believable
and consistent.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.021
She says Ronnie assaulted her
and stole her phone.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.956
He was found in possession
of that phone.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.157
Shall I go on?

25:58.157 --> 26:00.492
- My client won't deny
that he was there.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.161
- Oh, so now you're
changing your story?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.163
- Well, he was afraid if he
told you what happened,

26:04.163 --> 26:05.331
you would jump to conclusions.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.099
- Really?

26:09.836 --> 26:12.138
- Look, we went back
to her building.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.405
She was high, horny.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.141
Said she wanted
all of us at once.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.476
- She said that?

26:17.476 --> 26:20.847
Even though she had blacked out
and could barely walk?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.849
*

26:22.849 --> 26:26.653
- Well, and that's exactly
why we said no.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.655
She was messed up.

26:28.655 --> 26:31.390
Kept saying
she wanted it rough,

26:31.390 --> 26:34.761
but we not like that,
so we bounced.

26:34.761 --> 26:39.198
- Your victim must have
gone back on the prowl.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.100
How about misdemeanor assault
on the nanny?

26:53.680 --> 26:53.780
.

26:54.681 --> 26:55.682
- I saw the three of them
dragging Libby Parker

26:56.749 --> 26:58.951
towards the building.
- Uh-huh.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.054
Ronnie Ellis, Juan Flores,
and William Reeves?

27:03.355 --> 27:07.426
What happened next?
- I called 911.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.229
But that one--
Ronnie,

27:10.229 --> 27:12.899
he came backed at me,
punched me,

27:12.899 --> 27:14.701
and took my phone.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.568
Said he'll kill me
if I told anyone.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.706
- Did you see them
hurting Ms. Parker?

27:19.706 --> 27:21.373
- They were dragging her.

27:21.373 --> 27:25.211
- Or trying to help her up.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.614
Did you see them raping her?

27:30.182 --> 27:31.483
- No.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.786
- But you did see them
outsider her apartment door?

27:33.786 --> 27:36.488
- Yeah, uh, those two

27:36.488 --> 27:38.290
were trying to get inside.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.591
They had her keys.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.827
- What did you do?

27:40.827 --> 27:42.795
- I yelled at them
and they ran.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.897
- So you never actually saw

27:44.897 --> 27:47.533
any of the defendants
with the victim?

27:47.533 --> 27:48.901
- No.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.137
- What did you hear outside?
- A woman screaming.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.571
I went to the window to check.

27:52.571 --> 27:54.240
- Could you see
what was happening?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.175
- There were three men
surrounding her--

27:56.175 --> 27:57.744
teenagers, really.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.179
One black, two others
maybe Hispanic.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.515
- Did you provide that
description to the police

28:03.515 --> 28:05.752
before the defendants
were arrested?

28:05.752 --> 28:07.053
- No.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.455
It was dark.
I was confused at first,

28:09.455 --> 28:11.223
but I'm sure I saw them.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.658
- Why didn't you
call the police?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.294
- I saw the other tenants

28:15.294 --> 28:16.896
watching from their windows.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.298
Nobody seemed upset.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.033
I assumed
nothing bad was happening.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.536
- You were wrong.
- Yes.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.372
Libby was screaming for help.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.808
- If you had heard her
crying for help,

28:28.808 --> 28:31.143
wouldn't you have
called the police?

28:31.143 --> 28:32.945
- I guess I wasn't sure
what I heard.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.446
- So you came to
the conclusion

28:34.446 --> 28:36.949
that she was screaming
for help after the police

28:36.949 --> 28:38.785
told you she'd been assaulted?

28:38.785 --> 28:40.953
- I told the police
what I saw.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.254
- Initially, ma'am,

28:42.254 --> 28:44.190
you said you didn't
see their faces.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.495
- Well...
they were wearing hoodies

28:49.495 --> 28:53.265
like the ones those boys
on the news had.

28:53.265 --> 28:54.600
- [laughing]

28:54.600 --> 28:57.403
You don't think every boy
wearing a hoodie

28:57.403 --> 28:59.705
is a rapist, do you?

28:59.705 --> 29:02.474
- No, of course not.

29:05.111 --> 29:08.480
- I--I went to the cafe.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.849
Um...

29:09.849 --> 29:13.652
a man offered me Special K...

29:13.652 --> 29:16.122
and I took some.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.689
I'm not proud of that.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.692
- What happened next?
- I'm not sure.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.295
My memory of that night

29:23.295 --> 29:25.898
did not completely come back.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.500
- Do you remember giving consent
for a sexual encounter?

29:28.500 --> 29:30.069
- No.

29:30.069 --> 29:33.305
And I never would have
consented, ever,

29:33.305 --> 29:36.408
to three strangers
outside in public.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.911
That is not me.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.112
- Thank you.

29:44.884 --> 29:48.454
- I'm sorry about what happened
to you, Ms. Parker.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.621
- [sighs]

29:49.621 --> 29:50.990
- It sounds like you've
struggled with drugs.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.860
Was this the first time
you used ketamine?

29:53.860 --> 29:54.894
- No.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.695
- So you're familiar

29:56.695 --> 29:58.430
with one of its
main side effects:

29:58.430 --> 29:59.866
the loss of memory?

29:59.866 --> 30:03.702
- Objection.
- I'll allow.

30:03.702 --> 30:04.770
- Yes.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.605
- And you don't
remember anything

30:06.605 --> 30:07.907
after taking it?

30:07.907 --> 30:11.077
Meeting the defendants in
the cafe, leaving with them...

30:11.077 --> 30:13.045
- No, it was--
it was caught on video.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.481
- But you don't remember
going back to your building

30:15.481 --> 30:16.748
with them, do you?

30:18.784 --> 30:20.119
- No.

30:20.119 --> 30:24.056
- And you don't remember
begging them to have rough sex?

30:24.056 --> 30:27.393
- I didn't ask to be raped.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.695
- I'm sorry about your
injuries, Ms. Parker,

30:29.695 --> 30:32.798
but you can't even remember
if those injuries were sustained

30:32.798 --> 30:35.134
during rough,
consensual sex, can you?

30:35.134 --> 30:36.535
- Objection--
badgering.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.537
- Overruled.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.539
Witness will answer.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.708
[dramatic music]

30:42.708 --> 30:46.545
- I don't...
like rough sex.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.348
I never would've told them
that I did.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.251
- Yet you don't remember
leaving the cafe,

30:52.251 --> 30:54.120
or arriving home?

30:54.120 --> 30:56.956
You don't remember if the sex
was consensual,

30:56.956 --> 30:58.390
or even if there was sex.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.459
You don't remember if
it was even the defendants

31:00.459 --> 31:02.061
who were with you
in the courtyard.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.830
You don't remember anything,
do you, Ms. Parker?

31:04.830 --> 31:06.832
- [sighs]

31:06.832 --> 31:09.969
*

31:09.969 --> 31:12.204
No.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.640
*

31:14.640 --> 31:17.476
No, I--

31:17.476 --> 31:19.545
I don't remember.

31:19.545 --> 31:27.586
*

31:29.956 --> 31:31.423
That was awful.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.660
They're gonna get off,
aren't they?

31:34.660 --> 31:35.794
- Well, the--

31:35.794 --> 31:37.329
the jury heard what you
went through.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.098
That--that counts
for something.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.699
[knocking at door]

31:40.699 --> 31:42.668
- Excuse me.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.676
- Hi.
- Doug.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.244
Hi.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.980
- We wanted to see if
you're feeling better.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.148
- Uh, come in.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.616
Not really.

31:57.616 --> 32:01.053
- Tough day in court.

32:01.053 --> 32:04.190
- I got your flowers.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.525
I should've thanked you.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.994
Um, these are--

32:07.994 --> 32:09.395
- Yeah, I remember him.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.098
Um, why don't I come back later?

32:12.098 --> 32:13.365
- Okay.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.737
- Nice of him to stop by.
- Yeah.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.739
Doug, he's--
he's an odd duck,

32:20.739 --> 32:22.641
but he's--
he's been a friend.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.043
You know, we're both single.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.278
No family, no support--

32:26.278 --> 32:27.513
except AA.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.381
- He's in AA?

32:29.381 --> 32:32.684
- Yeah, uh, we both are.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.487
Uh, you know, I'm not
real good with sobriety,

32:35.487 --> 32:39.191
but Doug, he's--

32:39.191 --> 32:41.027
he's an old-timer.

32:41.027 --> 32:44.496
He works his program.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.565
Yeah, he gets real mad--

32:46.565 --> 32:48.700
he's real mad when I slip.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.138
- Um, excuse me one second.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.506
I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.675
- Take your time.

32:56.675 --> 32:59.611
- Excuse me, Doug.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.347
Can I ask you
a few questions?

33:01.347 --> 33:02.548
- What about?

33:02.548 --> 33:03.749
- Well, actually, it's about
what happened

33:03.749 --> 33:05.517
to your friend Libby.
- I wish I could help,

33:05.517 --> 33:07.686
but like I told you,
I wasn't home that night.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.421
- Yeah, you did,
but here's the thing, Doug.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.324
You also told me that you were
out a bar with your boyfriend

33:12.324 --> 33:14.726
and Libby just told me that
you're in AA and you're single.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.595
Now, that's two lies
right there.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.231
You were home that night,
weren't you?

33:19.231 --> 33:20.632
- I didn't see anything.

33:20.632 --> 33:24.236
- Yeah, but you were home.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.072
Listen, Doug,

33:26.072 --> 33:28.174
Libby needs your help right now.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.941
These guys--they're gonna
get away with this.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.777
- Better than having them
kill me.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.079
They know where I live.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.114
- They're not gonna do that--
not if you testify.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.116
You put them away.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.918
[dramatic music]

33:39.918 --> 33:41.353
I don't get this.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.355
All you had to do
was call 911.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.757
- I froze.
I'm--I'm--I'm--

33:45.757 --> 33:47.359
I'm not good in high-stress
situations.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.528
- It's just a phone call!
- I know.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.498
But I didn't.
I couldn't, and--

33:52.498 --> 33:53.899
and then it was too late.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.734
- No, not for an ambulance,
it wasn't.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.104
- I got drunk.
I screwed up.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.638
That's what I do.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.473
My whole life.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.642
I don't know why.

34:03.642 --> 34:04.776
That's what I do.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.413
- Okay, listen to me.
Everybody screws up, okay?

34:07.413 --> 34:09.715
Everybody.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.618
But Libby got hurt again
on that stand today.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.986
And if you don't testify,

34:14.986 --> 34:17.123
this case is over.

34:17.123 --> 34:21.827
*

34:21.827 --> 34:23.629
- I'm not even sure putting
this guy on the stand

34:23.629 --> 34:25.731
is a great idea.
- What, you got a better one?

34:25.731 --> 34:27.133
- He's worse
than all the others.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.168
And that's no easy task.
- Hey, Barba--

34:29.168 --> 34:30.636
- Well, at least they admitted
that they were there.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.271
- Okay, well, we're here now,
all right?

34:32.271 --> 34:33.339
And he was there that night.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.473
He's the only person
close enough

34:34.473 --> 34:36.375
to see their faces,
to see what they did to her.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.509
- And the jury believes him
because--

34:37.509 --> 34:38.577
- Because I went over his story

34:38.577 --> 34:39.645
backwards and forwards,
all right?

34:39.645 --> 34:40.746
This guy never varied.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.582
He gave a spot-on description
of each suspect.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.551
Now, maybe he's a coward,
yeah, uh-huh,

34:45.551 --> 34:46.885
but he's credible.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.287
- So good memory, no morality.
Fantastic.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.488
- When you prepped him,
did you tell him

34:49.488 --> 34:51.657
what time to show up,
since he's an hour late?

34:51.657 --> 34:53.192
- He'll show.
- If you say so.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.161
If not, I'll just vamp.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.229
- Ah, I'm here, I'm here.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.531
- Mr. Nelson, I am ADA Barba.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.601
You're prepared to testify?
- Yes, I am...

35:02.601 --> 35:05.404
prepared to testify.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.573
- Doug,
have you been drinking?

35:07.573 --> 35:10.542
- Yes, I have...
been drinking.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.578
I'm drunk,
but I'm still eidetic.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.746
- All right, so can we
get a postponement?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.215
- I have no one else to call.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.449
- I'm gonna get him some air.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.218
- Just get him coffee.

35:26.225 --> 35:26.358
.

35:27.092 --> 35:27.559
- I was walking my dog

35:29.595 --> 35:32.198
when I saw them in the middle
of the courtyard.

35:32.198 --> 35:35.801
Libby looked barely awake.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.270
I saw him and him

35:38.270 --> 35:41.773
taking turns forcing themselves
inside her mouth.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.976
- For the record,
the witness has identified

35:44.976 --> 35:47.646
the defendants Ronnie Ellis
and Juan Flores.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.647
Who else did you see?

35:48.647 --> 35:50.416
- The other defendant.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.951
- William Reeves.
- He was holding her down.

35:52.951 --> 35:56.121
- What did you do next?
- I went home.

35:56.121 --> 35:57.823
I know I should have
called the police,

35:57.823 --> 36:01.393
but I didn't.
I...

36:01.393 --> 36:05.797
started drinking instead,
until I forgot.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.367
I will never
forgive myself for that.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.735
- Thank you.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.075
- Before the night in question,

36:17.075 --> 36:19.711
when was the last time
you'd had a drink, Mr. Nelson?

36:19.711 --> 36:21.547
- Almost five years.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.882
- Is it possible
a relapse like that

36:23.882 --> 36:25.351
could've affected your memory?

36:25.351 --> 36:27.118
- I know what I saw.

36:27.118 --> 36:30.689
I learned how to function
while drunk a long time ago.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.459
- Did you ever describe
the suspects to the NYPD

36:33.459 --> 36:35.327
before they were arrested?

36:35.327 --> 36:37.996
- No, I waited too long
to come forward.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.398
- When you found out
that your friend

36:39.398 --> 36:43.269
had been seriously injured,
did you feel bad?

36:43.269 --> 36:45.136
- Yes.

36:45.136 --> 36:48.139
- Bad enough to positively ID
whichever suspects NYPD

36:48.139 --> 36:50.141
had in custody,
even though you were too drunk

36:50.141 --> 36:51.910
to remember what they
actually looked like?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.144
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

36:53.144 --> 36:55.547
- Mr. Nelson, are you
intoxicated right now?

36:58.284 --> 37:01.320
- Yes.
Yes, I am.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.423
[people mumbling]

37:06.057 --> 37:08.894
- Thank you.
Nothing further.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.400
- Redirect, Your Honor.
- I'll allow.

37:17.369 --> 37:18.670
- Why did you get drunk
that night?

37:19.905 --> 37:22.941
- Because what I'd seen
was horrible,

37:22.941 --> 37:25.611
but I failed to help Libby.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.913
I was mad at myself
for being a coward.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.081
- And why did you get drunk
this morning?

37:30.081 --> 37:33.385
- [sighs]
I was afraid to testify.

37:33.385 --> 37:36.087
I was afraid of what everyone
would think of me.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.324
- Fair enough.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.826
Um...

37:40.826 --> 37:44.796
Mr. Nelson, can you remember

37:44.796 --> 37:47.198
the questions that Mr. Henderson
just put to you?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.704
- When was the last time
I had a drink?

37:52.704 --> 37:56.141
Would a relapse have
affected my memory?

37:56.141 --> 37:59.645
Did I give the police
a description of the suspects

37:59.645 --> 38:01.880
before they were arrested?

38:01.880 --> 38:04.716
Shall I continue?
- That's all right.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.017
Can you remember
what the defendants

38:06.017 --> 38:09.955
were wearing that night?

38:09.955 --> 38:11.823
- Blue hoodie,

38:11.823 --> 38:13.725
black vest,

38:13.725 --> 38:15.226
black hoodie

38:15.226 --> 38:16.495
with leather sleeves.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.829
- Thank you.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.264
Mr. Nelson, can you--

38:19.264 --> 38:21.833
can you
look away from the jury

38:21.833 --> 38:23.702
and close your eyes?

38:23.702 --> 38:24.836
- Your Honor, are we
gonna have him

38:24.836 --> 38:26.037
touch his finger to his nose?

38:26.037 --> 38:27.138
- Just bear with me.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.007
- This better be good,
Mr. Barba.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.211
- Mr. Nelson, can you describe

38:33.211 --> 38:36.682
the makeup of the jury to me?

38:36.682 --> 38:37.716
[dramatic music]

38:37.716 --> 38:39.918
- Six men, six women.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.754
Four African-Americans.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.691
Two female Hispanics,

38:45.691 --> 38:47.759
one Asian woman...

38:47.759 --> 38:49.728
[murmuring]

38:49.728 --> 38:51.196
Three Caucasian men,

38:51.196 --> 38:55.066
two Caucasian women.

38:55.066 --> 38:58.169
Do--do you want to know
which ones are where?

38:58.169 --> 39:01.807
- No.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.809
You can open your eyes now.

39:03.809 --> 39:10.916
*

39:10.916 --> 39:13.151
- Nothing further.

39:13.151 --> 39:21.192
*

39:23.061 --> 39:24.430
- Mr. Barba!

39:24.430 --> 39:26.965
My client would like
to testify against the others.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.133
- It's too late, Counselor.
I don't need him.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.135
- He was a bystander.
You just heard that.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.237
He tried to stop them.
- Not hard enough.

39:32.237 --> 39:37.543
*

39:37.543 --> 39:40.446
- What should I say to her?

39:40.446 --> 39:42.280
- You could try "I'm sorry."

39:42.280 --> 39:44.583
*

39:44.583 --> 39:48.487
- Libby...

39:48.487 --> 39:52.524
I am so, so sorry.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.861
- So am I.

39:55.861 --> 40:03.234
*

40:03.234 --> 40:05.871
- Will the defendants
please rise?

40:05.871 --> 40:08.774
*

40:08.774 --> 40:11.276
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

40:11.276 --> 40:12.911
- We have, Your Honor.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.080
- What say you?

40:15.080 --> 40:17.248
- On the charge of
criminal sexual acts

40:17.248 --> 40:18.884
in the first degree,

40:18.884 --> 40:21.920
we find the defendants
Ronnie Ellis,

40:21.920 --> 40:26.958
Juan Flores,
and William Reeves guilty.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.195
[indistinct murmuring]

40:30.195 --> 40:32.230
- Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

40:32.230 --> 40:35.801
the state of New York
thanks you for your service.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.870
The defendants will be
remanded until sentencing.

40:38.870 --> 40:39.905
[raps gavel]

40:39.905 --> 40:41.239
*

40:41.239 --> 40:43.108
- Maybe Libby can move on now.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.876
- Oh, you think she's
gonna change her life? I don't.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.478
I think she'll be drinking
again by Friday night.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.079
- You just got back.
You're tired.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.081
Let me drive you home.

40:50.081 --> 40:56.755
*

40:56.755 --> 40:58.957
- Good job.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.529
[somber music]

41:03.529 --> 41:07.633
- He's good.
He's sleeping like a baby.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.901
Me? I'm fine.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.305
I took the mandatory
time off, and--

41:14.305 --> 41:18.043
Yes,
I'm seeing my shrink.

41:18.043 --> 41:21.913
Well, that does sound
like more fun.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.349
Rain check?

41:24.349 --> 41:25.884
Okay.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.153
Okay, me too.

41:28.153 --> 41:31.022
Bye.
