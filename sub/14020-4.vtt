NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.735 --> 00:06.616
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.740 --> 00:08.515
the police who
investigate crime

00:08.609 --> 00:11.249
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.478 --> 00:12.980
These are their stories.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.793
Fifteen people?
I cooked enough for 50.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.454
You think anyone eats it?

00:18.585 --> 00:20.189
So concerned if
they're gonna fit

00:20.254 --> 00:21.824
into their tiny little clothes.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.367
Well, I guess
a rehearsal dinner,

00:23.423 --> 00:26.427
Mr. and Mrs. Vance want to make
sure they put out a good spread.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.167
Honey, if I had that spread
when I was getting married,

00:29.229 --> 00:31.641
my man might've stayed
just for the leftovers.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.698
(LAUGHING)

00:34.501 --> 00:37.311
Oh! Sweet Jesus!

00:37.471 --> 00:39.280
It's Christy Garrison!

00:39.339 --> 00:41.341
Quick, get Mr. Vance!

00:41.909 --> 00:43.911
Christy Garrison, 15.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.253
ID'd by her dad,
Michael Garrison.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.123
You read about him? Guy's
worth half a billion dollars.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.321
Another lesson in
what money can't buy.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.796
He the suit or the blue shirt?

00:52.853 --> 00:55.629
Blue shirt. Guy in the suit
is Mark Vance, the neighbor.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.327
That the lady who
found the girl?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.065
Yeah, Vondie Morris.
She's the Vances' cook.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.434
She wrings her hands one more
time, they're gonna fall off.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.271
Anything in her pockets?

01:04.331 --> 01:06.504
20 bucks.
An inhaler, full.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.740
BRISCOE: Ah, asthma. Sex?

01:08.969 --> 01:11.074
Don't know. Clothes aren't
torn, her nails look fine.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.412
No sign of a struggle.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.248
Yeah, except somebody
clocked her against the wall.

01:15.375 --> 01:18.379
Well, no robbery.
Her jewelry's still on.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.386
Stick here, Agnelli. Be nice.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.995
Miss Morris, uh,
you came outside...

01:24.051 --> 01:26.964
At 7:30. I let Nell
in, another maid.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.897
I'm a live-in.
Nell, she lives out.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.593
You see or hear anything last night?
Early this morning?

01:31.658 --> 01:34.264
No. I was tired.
Had an early night.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.698
You knew this girl?

01:35.762 --> 01:39.300
I've seen her time to time.
Outside smoking, that's all.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.804
Do you need me? I got breakfast
to put on the table.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.177
No. Maybe later. Thanks.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.579
ED: ...doing outside in
the middle of the night?

01:45.639 --> 01:46.709
I don't know what she
was doing outside

01:46.773 --> 01:48.184
in the middle of
the night, Detective.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.413
We all went to bed early.

01:49.476 --> 01:52.013
We had dinner together
last night. Our house.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.750
Both families. Everyone.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.816
Anybody have a bedroom
faces the alley?

01:56.350 --> 01:59.092
Yes, we do. But we
didn't hear anything.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.926
You go in, Mr. Garrison. You be with your family.
We'll be in shortly.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.528
Is that gate locked
all the time?

02:05.726 --> 02:06.796
Yes.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.833
Uh, who has access
to it from the outside?

02:11.231 --> 02:13.609
Immediate families.
Mine, Michael's.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.243
My chauffeur, Sammy. He's the
only one with an opener.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.441
Could you get him, please?

02:17.504 --> 02:19.780
He's not here yet.
He was due at 6:30.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.183
He late a lot?

02:21.241 --> 02:22.413
Not like this.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.513
He comes, takes the limo out
of the garage, pulls it up.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.022
Can we see the limo?

02:26.079 --> 02:27.285
Yes, of course.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.159
Sammy been with you long?

02:30.250 --> 02:32.787
Since the beginning of the year.
He's Vondie's son.

02:36.123 --> 02:39.002
Why do I get the feeling Sammy
won't be calling in sick?

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.209 --> 03:32.247
I haven't seen my son.
He doesn't check in with me.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.053
Did you talk to him on the phone?
Uh-uh.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.322
Any idea where he is?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.522
Mr. Vance knows
where he lives.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.028
We sent a patrol car
to his house, Mrs. Morris.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.599
Sammy wasn't there.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.726
Now, where else could he be?

03:43.790 --> 03:44.860
A girlfriend?

03:44.925 --> 03:46.871
I don't know why he's not here.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.337
I don't know why
you're so keen on

03:48.395 --> 03:51.865
whoever killed that
poor child being my child.

03:51.932 --> 03:55.004
I'm just keen on finding
out who did it, Mrs. Morris.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.983
Why is it always some raised-right
black boy you got your eye on?

04:03.276 --> 04:04.846
She must have gone outside.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.186
She knew I hated smoking.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.956
I should have let
her smoke in here.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.728
Did she know Sammy Morris?

04:15.522 --> 04:16.933
I can't see how.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.594
Christy goes
to boarding school.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.769
She's just been back two days.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.431
Either of you have
dealings with him?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.073
He drove us, Nick and me.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.469
Nick is?

04:26.633 --> 04:29.614
Mercedes' fiancÃ©,
Nicholas Vance.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.583
What's Sammy like?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.609
I don't know.
He's just the driver.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.880
The last time either of you
saw Christy was what time?

04:38.945 --> 04:41.425
We left the Vances'
around 10:00 o'clock.

04:42.315 --> 04:43.692
Mike Vance was tired.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.253
He had, uh, chemo
for prostate cancer.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.628
So, it was right after that,

04:51.758 --> 04:54.466
maybe 10:30, when my
angel went to bed.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.334
The last time I saw her.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.607
Mark leaves before I'm awake.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.677
I rarely see Sammy.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.075
He seemed a nice
enough young man.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.512
How about you two?

05:08.575 --> 05:10.851
He sometimes drives me
when Dad doesn't need him.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.754
He's a pretty friendly guy.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.588
Friendly with the neighbors?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.322
If Christy was outside, I'm sure
he would have talked to her.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.353
You ever talk to him?

05:19.419 --> 05:21.922
No. Dad won't
let him drive me.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.899
Ethan doesn't need a driver.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.602
Caught him outside smoking
a joint one morning.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.103
Said something about it, and
he just told me to shut up.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.469
Any other problems?

05:30.530 --> 05:33.909
A week ago my father said
he had to set Sammy straight.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.605
Set him straight?

05:35.669 --> 05:36.875
MERCEDES: Nick.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.445
BRISCOE:
Excuse me. I hate to intrude,

05:40.507 --> 05:43.420
but your father had to set
Sammy straight about what?

05:43.476 --> 05:46.013
He was using the limo's
car phone for personal calls.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.489
Who was he calling?

05:47.647 --> 05:49.058
Sounded like a girlfriend.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.284
You know who she is?
No, sir.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.024
Do you have the
cell phone bills?

05:54.421 --> 05:57.027
Regina isn't here.
What's she done?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.297
We're after her
boyfriend, Sammy.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.633
She left with him last night.
What time?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.436
I heard them. Five
something in the morning,

06:03.496 --> 06:05.169
they're dressed,
going out the door.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.711
Any idea where they
might have gone?

06:06.766 --> 06:09.770
She said they were going to her
sister Evelyn's in Queens.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.076
I hope they stay there.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.048
I can get some
sleep for a change.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.414
You got the sister's address?

06:14.474 --> 06:16.010
Yeah. I'll get it.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.053
I come home after
the night shift,

06:21.114 --> 06:22.593
the wife and kids are gone.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.985
Bitch takes the suitcase,
the kids' clothes.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.122
Any idea where they'd go that
time of night, Mr. Jasper?

06:27.187 --> 06:29.064
That time of night,
I expect my wife flat

06:29.122 --> 06:31.033
on her back in bed,
legs spread.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.898
Her busy-body sister, Reggie, she
must have put her up to this.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.098
Yeah, well, leaving you
in the lurch and all.

06:35.161 --> 06:38.574
My point. So, you're
gonna get my kids, right?

06:38.765 --> 06:39.766
Bring my wife back?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.938
Well, we'd love to help you out, Mr. Jasper,
but we don't know where they are.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.279
Well, where'd she go? It'll
only be her mother's in Jersey.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.944
This time, I want you
to arrest my no-good husband.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.682
Well, actually we're
looking for Sammy Morris.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.324
You're Regina Cobb?

06:54.447 --> 06:57.917
Reggie. What do you want with Sammy?
Man's a hero.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.792
Sure. Where's the hero now?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.833
My sister calls last night.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.630
Says Frankie the Fist beat
on her before going to work.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.796
Come get her. I call Sammy.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.067
He says he'll get the limo, come
over, get me, go to Queens,

07:10.130 --> 07:11.837
we'll get my sister, the kids.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.844
So, he stole Mr. Vance's limo?

07:13.900 --> 07:14.901
Borrowed.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.603
He brought us by here.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.843
And then what?
He just vanishes?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.019
Brady threw up again.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.716
These men don't need to know
your brother's business.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.315
Your little brother got sick?

07:27.414 --> 07:30.293
In the car.
Uncle Sammy was mad.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.227
He gotta get the car washed.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.830
So, where's the
nearest car wash?

07:36.389 --> 07:38.062
Sammy Morris?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.096
Yeah. We need you
to come with us.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.606
What for?
Borrowing the car?

07:42.662 --> 07:44.767
For the murder
of Christy Garrison.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.674
What, the sister?
She's murdered?

07:46.933 --> 07:48.640
You're kidding me.
If I was kidding you,

07:48.702 --> 07:50.648
I'd be wearing a fez
and no pants.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.014
I didn't do anything, man.
I swear for God.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.747
School ID. Christy
Francis Garrison.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.846
Lipstick inside, pocket
mirror, palm pilot.

07:58.979 --> 07:59.980
Let's go.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.249
I was bringing the limo back.

08:03.550 --> 08:06.326
Accident in the tunnel
held us up, Brady got sick.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.727
I had to wait for
the car wash to open.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.460
I couldn't bring the
limo back like that.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.593
Yeah, right. Compared
to offing the neighbor,

08:11.658 --> 08:13.695
messing up the boss's
car is a big no-no.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.967
I had nothing to do with
what happened to that girl.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.599
Lab found semen
in the back seat,

08:17.664 --> 08:19.575
Sam, next to
Christy's disco bag.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.202
You have nothing
to do with that?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.175
What, you think I'm gonna
hop in the back seat,

08:23.336 --> 08:25.873
have a go at my girlfriend, her
sister and kids in the car?

08:25.939 --> 08:28.215
Actually, that's not
what we were thinking.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.421
Is my mom okay?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.822
BRISCOE: Your mom's fine, kid.
She's the true believer.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.985
I didn't do anything.
That's why she believes me.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.620
Well, she's the only one
holding down the fort.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.322
You ask Mr. Vance. He knows
I had nothing to do with it.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.558
How would he know?

08:43.923 --> 08:45.960
I get along with him.
He gives me my props.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.836
And Christy Garrison?
She disrespect you?

08:48.895 --> 08:50.135
I don't know her.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.801
But the rest of her family, they
got more money than manners.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.004
Right. So, you figure you
make friends with Christy,

08:55.068 --> 08:58.174
get close to that money, and maybe
some of it falls in your pocket.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.014
Around those people,
I keep my hands in my pocket.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.045
All right, so if you're straight with
this, you'll volunteer some blood.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.589
We can test it
against the semen.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.291
Do it. So, my mom won't get in trouble.
Go ahead.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.490
No jackpot, gentlemen. Lab says Sammy's
blood doesn't type with the semen.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.430
Lot of traffic in that limo.

09:16.489 --> 09:20.335
The M.E. put the time of death between
3:00 and 5:00 in the morning.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.564
So, who came knocking
at her back door last night?

09:22.629 --> 09:24.040
I found something.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.770
It's a handwritten
note in her palm pilot.

09:25.865 --> 09:29.005
"It's the bomb. Call me."
And it's signed Kelly.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.141
There's a phone number
and a time, 12:30 last night.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.014
Maybe Christy went out,
brought someone back with her.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.488
Her parents said the little
angel went to bed at 10:30.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.116
You were never a kid?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.160
Allspice didn't
take his ginkgo.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.660
I met Christy down at
Club Isis, on Avenue B.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.221
She with anybody, Kelly?

09:47.287 --> 09:50.131
Everybody. She was wasted.
Coming on to everyone.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.295
BRISCOE: What's this note
"It's the bomb" mean?

09:52.358 --> 09:53.530
It means it's cool.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.197
What was cool?
The whole scene.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.798
So, you met her, you hung out
a little while, then what?

09:57.864 --> 09:59.172
She had trouble breathing.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.405
I think she ran out of her
asthma medication or something.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.379
She left with some guy.
ED: You know him?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.041
You remember what
he looked like?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.106
WOMAN: Kelly.
I don't know.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.015
Look, I gotta go
help a customer.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.246
No, you gotta help us.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.447
Now, what did the boy
at this cool scene look like?

10:12.512 --> 10:16.016
He was cute. Just a general impression.
It was dark, you know?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.857
He wearing anything
you remember?

10:18.284 --> 10:19.285
No.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.923
Okay, go ahead. Thanks
for all your help.

10:22.989 --> 10:26.766
CSU found a full inhaler in
Christy's pocket at the scene,

10:26.826 --> 10:28.772
but her inhaler was
empty at the club.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.809
There's a 24-hour drugstore
on First and Avenue A.

10:32.932 --> 10:36.505
Yeah, I remember her.
Pretty girl. Pretty sick.

10:36.836 --> 10:40.147
She came in with a boy, showed me her
inhaler, and, uh, wanted a refill.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.082
You give it to her?
Oh, yeah. Standard procedure.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.247
I gave her one from behind
the counter to hold her.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.120
Got her doc's phone number,
went to call for a refill,

10:47.180 --> 10:49.217
and when I got back,
they're gone.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.022
Can we see your
security camera tapes?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.654
Yeah, sure.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.189
Okay.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.258
There.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.802
Time stamp's in the corner.

10:59.926 --> 11:03.464
BRISCOE: 12:56 a.m.
There's Christy.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.834
Who's that?

11:09.736 --> 11:11.807
BRISCOE: That's Ethan Vance.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.711
Another angel who
went to bed early.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.451
She called me just
before midnight,

11:22.515 --> 11:23.823
and she said she
wanted to go to a club.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.157
ED: How'd she sound?

11:25.218 --> 11:28.324
She was up for going out. A witness
at the club said she was wasted.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.459
Look it, I didn't give
her anything, okay?

11:30.557 --> 11:34.164
Look it, you lied to us, okay? Believing
you isn't at the top of our list.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.635
I don't like
your tone, Detective.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.868
I was trying to protect
her reputation.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.999
She gonna get
a rep for wheezing?

11:41.234 --> 11:42.736
So, you brought
her home. Then what?

11:43.136 --> 11:46.049
I stayed with her while she had
a smoke, and I went to bed.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.207
BRISCOE: What time?

11:48.074 --> 11:50.076
Uh, I don't know
It was before 2:00.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.420
You didn't take her out for a quick
spin around the back of the limo?

11:53.980 --> 11:54.981
No.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.421
ED: We heard she was at the club
flirting with anything with a heartbeat.

11:58.885 --> 11:59.886
Yeah. So?

11:59.953 --> 12:00.954
That make you jealous?

12:02.188 --> 12:03.189
That was kid stuff.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.929
Well, at 15, she was a kid.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.368
Maybe you should have
thought of that before

12:06.426 --> 12:08.428
you took advantage of her condition.
KAUFER: That's enough.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.608
He admits to being
with Miss Garrison,

12:10.663 --> 12:12.108
not to having sexual relations.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.111
Fine. Then let him
volunteer his blood.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.204
KAUFER: Absolutely not. ED:
Sammy Morris gave blood.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.976
He isn't Sammy Morris.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.140
You said you'd cooperate.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.446
We have. But on this point,

12:23.509 --> 12:25.420
I have to listen
to our attorneys.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.819
All right. We'll have to let the
district attorney handle it.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.626
KAUFER: Besides invading
the privacy of an individual

12:32.685 --> 12:34.494
who hasn't been
charged with any crime,

12:34.554 --> 12:36.625
a DNA match would
prove nothing.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.032
It would certainly place
him with the victim

12:38.091 --> 12:39.729
at the approximate
time she was killed.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.998
You have any other supporting
evidence for a murder charge?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.165
They have nothing
except sleazy innuendo.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.903
Which even if true,
is evidence of nothing.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.979
It might be evidence of rape.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.877
There is no evidence
of forcible sex.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.040
Statutory rape.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.447
Oh, go on.
Your Honor,

12:52.505 --> 12:54.985
this is simply an attempt to
embarrass a prominent family.

12:55.074 --> 12:58.954
Miss Carmichael, I have to weigh
Mr. Vance's privacy rights against

12:59.012 --> 13:01.424
the chance you'll
establish a fact,

13:01.481 --> 13:04.155
which isn't even evidence
of a substantial crime.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.921
Motion denied.
But Your Honor...

13:05.985 --> 13:08.966
Until you have actual
evidence of murder,

13:09.088 --> 13:11.295
take no for an answer, hmm?

13:13.593 --> 13:15.595
ED: The girl was
a walking drugstore.

13:15.662 --> 13:22.170
Tox panel shows cocaine, GHB, marijuana,
liquor, Xanax, albuterol, Ativan, aspirin.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.442
We're still waiting on the
other autopsy test results.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.505
So far, that's it?

13:25.571 --> 13:28.711
So far, we got some rich folks
running interference for their brat.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.220
You got a problem
with rich people?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.482
Other than the fact
that they're trying

13:31.544 --> 13:33.524
to buy their way out from
under a murder charge?

13:33.579 --> 13:34.785
They're just trying
to protect their kid.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.986
With or without a platinum
card, they're still parents.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.064
Parents who have their names on
a wing at the public library.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.099
So, they impressed a judge.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.657
Find something more impressive.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.098
I don't see how you
can be right about this.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.635
I mean, the Vances
are practically family.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.835
They're the best people.
Well, the parents, maybe.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.970
No, even their boys.

13:57.303 --> 14:01.012
Ethan admits to taking your daughter
to a club at 1:00 in the morning.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.485
Ever know Ethan to lose his temper?
Get violent?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.489
No. No.
No.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.555
Did Christy have
a thing going with him?

14:08.648 --> 14:11.629
No. They were like brother and
sister, ever since we moved in.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.698
ED: When was that?
Two years ago.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.528
Ever get the impression Ethan wanted
to be more than a big brother?

14:18.391 --> 14:20.234
No. Never.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.499
BRISCOE: I don't get it.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.663
The kid takes your daughter
out for a night on the town,

14:23.730 --> 14:26.267
and you're not the least
bit suspicious of him?

14:26.332 --> 14:28.141
You don't understand.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.548
The Vances have gone out of their
way to make us feel at home.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.481
So? You're rich, they're rich.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.383
Why shouldn't they
make you feel welcome?

14:37.043 --> 14:40.422
(EXHALES) The Vances, as you
very well know, are old money.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.955
And the ink isn't
dry on your dough.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.861
People like the Vances often
don't let you forget it.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.297
Mark and Marianna have
been awfully decent to us.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.130
It is hard to believe
that their son could

14:51.190 --> 14:54.000
have anything to do
with Christy's death.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.298
VONDIE: You apologize
all you want.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.899
That won't get my
boy his job back.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.468
Look, Sammy cooperated.
We hope you will, too.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.605
So, I tell you stories
out of school,

15:03.669 --> 15:05.774
then I'll be looking
for a job, too.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.044
We just want the truth.

15:07.106 --> 15:09.916
The truth is that little girl
wasn't such a good girl.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.047
Why do you think they sent
her to boarding school?

15:12.111 --> 15:14.819
We know she had bad habits.
What about Ethan?

15:16.349 --> 15:19.023
Look, you have to talk
to us, Mrs. Morris.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.358
Ethan did a little drinking.
All boys do that.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.991
He ever get violent
when he drank?

15:24.056 --> 15:27.094
No. He got sick
sometimes, that's all.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.969
Ever forget what he
did the night before?

15:29.128 --> 15:31.836
I don't know.
He's not an alcoholic.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.377
But he drinks
enough to get sick.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.745
(SIGHS) By accident.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.712
He gets drunk by accident?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.182
Yes. Like at Nick's
bachelor party.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.515
They carried Ethan home,
sick as a pup.

15:42.575 --> 15:46.580
It was because he gave blood that morning
at his school and he hadn't eaten.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.217
That was his excuse?
He gave blood? Where?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.956
At his school, Langley Prep.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.629
I don't see anything here.

15:53.686 --> 15:57.065
Langley Prep. Two weeks ago. Blood drive.
Ethan Vance. You have records of that.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.501
We do. And you keep
records for public use?

15:59.559 --> 16:03.166
Tracking donors, eliminating AIDS,
other blood-transmitted diseases?

16:03.262 --> 16:07.176
Of course. And the donated blood
is carefully screened, tracked?

16:07.233 --> 16:09.042
Yes, but it's
private information.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.582
We're not asking you to tell us
if Ethan Vance has any disease.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.480
We just want to know
where the blood is.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.117
We don't want to drink it.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.883
V-A-N-C-E. Ethan Daniel.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.327
We'd like to know
if the blood was used.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.888
No, it was not used. And,
no, I can't give it to you.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.997
BRISCOE: You see this?
Oh.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.825
Ah.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.761
You see this?

16:34.827 --> 16:38.297
Temporary restraining order. We're
prevented from giving up the blood.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.241
Who issued this thing?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.204
Judge Walter Schreiber.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.446
So, does this mean somebody comes in
here bleeding from every orifice,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.008
you can't give
it to them either?

16:48.107 --> 16:51.850
That means, you're B-positive,
Detective, and your head explodes,

16:51.911 --> 16:53.686
I gotta take a pass.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.516
(SIGHS)

16:57.817 --> 16:59.660
CARMICHAEL: Why slap an order
on the blood if they aren't

16:59.719 --> 17:01.392
concerned about what
the blood will show?

17:01.454 --> 17:04.195
Violation of doctor-patient
privilege, pure and simple.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.931
Why Miss Carmichael's insistent
on getting her panties in a...

17:06.992 --> 17:08.472
Mr. Eliezer.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.031
Ethan Vance gave the blood
away in a school drive.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.102
There was no privilege implied,
nor any expectation of it.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.113
There wasn't even a doctor.
ELIEZER: Doctor? Nurse?

17:17.169 --> 17:20.048
What difference does it make?
It was a medical procedure.

17:20.106 --> 17:23.178
Privilege implies choice about
how the blood would be used.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.723
Ethan Vance did not, nor could he,
mandate to whom the blood would

17:26.779 --> 17:29.123
be given or in what
manner it might be used.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.389
Once he provided it to a
federally funded agency,

17:31.450 --> 17:33.123
his blood became public domain.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.688
I think the key words here,
Your Honor, are "his blood."

17:35.755 --> 17:39.965
It was blood given up
to be used on or for anyone.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.360
It was not a blood test.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.832
SCHREIBER: I agree.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.433
The minute he gave blood, Mr. Vance
forfeited his right to privacy.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.435
I'll lift the
restraining order.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.071
The police can have the blood.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.681
Ethan Vance's DNA didn't
match the semen in the limo.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.648
But it matched the semen
found in the girl's body.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.648
I thought you already
did a rape kit.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.952
This wouldn't have
shown up on a rape kit.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.594
Oh, the New York Disco Diet.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.659
She had sex within
a half hour of her death.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.392
Different semen. So, there's
another player on the scene.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.492
One from the home team.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.238
I ran a mitochondrial DNA
on the two semen samples.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.666
They're from two
related individuals.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.533
(SIGHS)

18:20.633 --> 18:22.544
M.E. says we can
count the father out.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.946
With prostate surgery,
chemo, she doubts if

18:25.004 --> 18:26.813
he could come up
with the goods.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.019
That leaves the groom,
Nicholas Vance.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.554
Bring both brothers in?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.715
Absolutely.
Charge them with murder?

18:33.279 --> 18:36.089
Their lawyers will have that
bounced before we can say boo.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.958
Start with statutory rape, and we'll
work up the food chain from there.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.799
Ethan Vance, we're
gonna need your hands.

18:44.857 --> 18:48.066
Why? You're under arrest for
the rape of Christy Garrison.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.097
You can thank me later.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.774
I hope you went
for the Ming vase.

18:54.834 --> 18:55.972
What do you want?

18:56.269 --> 18:57.907
We can, uh, talk
in my car, huh?

18:57.970 --> 19:01.850
What can you possibly have to tell me in
your car that you can't tell me here?

19:02.541 --> 19:04.077
That you're under arrest.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.584
This is ridiculous. For what?

19:07.113 --> 19:09.525
Rape.
What? Who?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.893
Mr. Vance, in the car, please.
No, no, no, no, no.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.056
Just who did I allegedly rape?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.464
Your late future
sister-in-law.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.894
I'm sorry, Miss.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.702
A million dollars each?
That's ludicrous, Your Honor.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.304
My clients are charged
with statutory rape.

19:30.369 --> 19:33.316
And forcible rape. They're
also suspects in a murder.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.919
They had sex with a 15-year-old
within half an hour of her death.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.251
If they had substantiating
evidence of murder,

19:38.311 --> 19:40.018
they would have charged
my clients with murder.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.559
I want to keep them from running
before we can gather that evidence.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.425
These are people of means... And
people without means never flee?

19:45.685 --> 19:49.531
Your Honor, Nicholas Vance is engaged to be married.
Ethan is a full-time student.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.761
This family is well known.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.996
And well connected enough
to facilitate flight.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.164
Two million dollars
is simply prohibitive.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.262
They have assets.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.036
The Vances are heavily
invested, Your Honor.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.906
They would have to liquidate
a large part of their assets.

19:59.965 --> 20:00.966
Property, then.
Mortgaged.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.775
Some in the process of being
sold, others in escrow.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.916
Mr. Kaufer, is this
a temporary situation,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.451
or are your clients just poor?

20:07.506 --> 20:09.986
Pedal back on the sarcasm,
Miss Carmichael.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.022
The charge at present
is not murder.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.124
A million each for two counts
of rape is not indicated.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.726
Bail is set at $100,000 per.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.884
(GAVEL STRIKES)

20:21.520 --> 20:24.126
You can expect our motions
on this crap tomorrow.

20:24.256 --> 20:27.066
Sounds like you're the one
with the knot in your shorts.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.739
The firm of Eliezer, Kaufer
and Larkin has 500 lawyers.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.243
And all of them must have been
working on these last night.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.335
ADAM: Yes, right.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.312
They cover the waterfront.
Everything from tossing

20:37.369 --> 20:39.747
the DNA to changing
the color of my lipstick.

20:39.839 --> 20:43.412
They have studies from
a Dr. Euclidene of Lucerne,

20:43.476 --> 20:47.151
a lab in the UK, expert witnesses
lined up from all points.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.621
They're bringing in
the pros from Dover.

20:50.049 --> 20:53.258
Yeah, and the pros will confuse a
jury enough to make them think

20:53.452 --> 20:55.523
DNA is a new pop group.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.933
The Vances are spending
a lot of money for people

20:58.991 --> 21:02.029
who were pleading poverty
at the bail hearing.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.802
Well, I checked their finances.
Lots of restructured loans.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.139
The old money seems to be
getting a bit arthritic.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.544
Maybe they borrowed a cup
of money from their neighbor.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.777
The Vances still have fire power.
They will not go gently.

21:13.839 --> 21:16.615
Neither will we.
Read and respond.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.785
What about your
murder investigation?

21:18.844 --> 21:21.552
Search warrant's already
executed on the Vances' house.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.661
The boys' rooms, Ethan's locker
at school came up empty.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.823
Any evidence that
this was forcible rape?

21:27.987 --> 21:29.022
CARMICHAEL: No.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.633
Then where's their
motive for murder?

21:31.490 --> 21:33.731
Ethan had motive. Jealousy.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.702
He has sex with Christy first, and
comes back and finds her with Nick.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.209
And Nick slept with his
fiancÃ©e's under-age sister.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.270
She tells anyone, it might put
the kibosh on the wedding plans.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.005
Two motives,

21:46.739 --> 21:48.514
one possible killer.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.176
Pick one.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.315
Nicholas Vance is not
Mercedes' former fiancÃ©.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.423
They're still engaged.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.888
I'm sorry? I'm confused.

22:01.954 --> 22:05.060
We have proof he had sexual
relations with your sister.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.598
I don't believe it.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.335
It's okay, Mercedes.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.300
Nick wouldn't do that.

22:11.297 --> 22:14.767
PEPPER: We're told you can make DNA
say anything you want it to say.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.143
Why in the world would we want to...
I don't know.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.915
First you picked on this
black man, now on the boys.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.211
Maybe rich people are fair game.
Mrs. Garrison...

22:23.275 --> 22:26.381
We've had this terrible
thing happen to us.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.552
Now, we're just trying
to salvage whatever

22:28.614 --> 22:30.958
happiness we can for
our only daughter.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.954
Why do you insist
on destroying that?

22:35.488 --> 22:36.489
Look,

22:37.656 --> 22:40.933
I'm sorry your fiancÃ© is not
the man you thought he was.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.040
Only you know what
he's capable of.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.969
When you're ready to help us,

22:47.466 --> 22:49.503
you can call me at this number.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.851
Nick? I got nothing
bad to say about him.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.057
When you drove Nick around,
what did you talk about?

23:01.113 --> 23:04.651
Look, my mom's too old
to get another job.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.989
Mr. and Mrs. Vance like
her, and she likes them.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.793
I'm not getting in
the middle of this.

23:08.854 --> 23:10.561
I don't want to hurt
your mother,

23:10.789 --> 23:13.167
and you telling me what you
know about Nick can't do that.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.136
I'm saying guy's
been good to me.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.400
Good to you?

23:17.162 --> 23:18.937
He's the guy who pointed
the finger at you

23:18.998 --> 23:21.501
in the first place the
morning of the murder.

23:21.667 --> 23:25.171
He told us you were using his dad's
car phone to call your girlfriend.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.813
He did? Come on.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.444
How do you think the police
found out about Regina?

23:31.510 --> 23:34.150
Man, I was on that phone with her
because I was cooling my jets,

23:34.280 --> 23:37.284
waiting while Nick was popping
one off with his girlfriend.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.394
You mean, someone
besides Mercedes?

23:39.919 --> 23:42.263
Someone way besides Mercedes.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.368
He's my lover and he hasn't
tried to kill me yet.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.265
How often do you see him?

23:52.331 --> 23:54.242
(CHUCKLES) You know.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.204
No, I really don't.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.871
As often as he wants it.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.316
Sometimes four times a week,
sometimes once a month.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.983
You know he has a fiancÃ©e.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.852
Yeah. Well, we
all got someone.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.390
And you still do this?
You see him?

24:09.648 --> 24:11.286
Why shut off the faucet?

24:11.517 --> 24:12.928
It's Nick Vance, lady.

24:12.985 --> 24:16.262
Ain't some homeboy named Jo-Jo who
brings me a can of beer once a month.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.025
And after he's married?

24:18.857 --> 24:20.530
Why would it stop?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.800
Look, his fiancÃ©e's
Mercedes Garrison, okay?

24:23.862 --> 24:27.071
I met her once. Some snooty
store Nick took me to.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.341
Nick says she has some issues.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.607
Issues? With you?

24:33.105 --> 24:34.516
Some emotional junk.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.519
You know how rich people are. You can
afford a therapist, you see one.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.782
You met her at a store.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.784
You let on who you were?

24:42.881 --> 24:44.383
She knows who I am.

24:44.783 --> 24:45.989
Really?

24:46.285 --> 24:48.094
Look, lady, it ain't a big deal.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.195
I'm, like, on his payroll,
and she knows it.

24:52.024 --> 24:55.471
When she can't find him, she
calls here looking for him,

24:55.694 --> 24:57.935
like I'm an answering service.

24:59.798 --> 25:02.608
I tried asking Mercedes
about Nick's girlfriend.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.608
Couldn't get past
the front door.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.975
But the IUDS confirm calls from the
Garrison house to the girlfriend.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.519
Mercedes afraid of Nick?

25:09.608 --> 25:10.848
That why she'd put up with him?

25:10.909 --> 25:14.288
These people are aliens, Jack. I have
no idea what any of them are thinking.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.916
What the hell is
this marriage about?

25:15.981 --> 25:18.825
Well, I'm guessing love is not
at the top of the hit parade.

25:18.884 --> 25:21.194
So, Carlita says Mercedes
knows about her.

25:21.987 --> 25:25.560
We can't ask Mercedes, 'cause she's playing MIA.
Who else would know?

25:25.858 --> 25:27.963
Your fiancÃ©'s sleeping around,
you're gonna tell someone.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.028
Maid of honor?

25:29.461 --> 25:30.565
Do you know who she is?

25:30.629 --> 25:32.404
Maybe the society pages?

25:34.199 --> 25:36.145
Merce hinted Nick
played around.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.714
She didn't seem to mind.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.842
I'm having a hard time understanding
what Mercedes sees in him.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.182
He's Nick Vance, for one thing.

25:43.309 --> 25:47.655
Mrs. Garrison was turned down for membership
to the Merrimont Club three times.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.090
Since the engagement, she's in.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.754
That's so important
to Mercedes?

25:53.519 --> 25:55.829
I met her in boarding
school in Connecticut.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.832
They had just gotten back from
Argentina, where her dad was working.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.764
I think her parents
spent their last dime

26:00.826 --> 26:02.601
getting her into
St. Bethany's.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.704
I thought her
parents were loaded.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.008
Not till Mr. Garrison cashes
in his stock options, maybe.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.072
What was her relationship
with Christy like?

26:11.437 --> 26:13.474
Big age difference,
so they weren't close.

26:13.539 --> 26:16.520
Did you see either of them the Sunday,
the day before Christy was killed?

26:16.608 --> 26:18.781
I was supposed to meet
them at Taryn Hsu on Saturday,

26:18.844 --> 26:20.721
Merce's final fitting
for her wedding gown.

26:21.013 --> 26:24.620
But she called me on my cell, told me
change of plans, to meet her at Paillard.

26:24.683 --> 26:25.753
Why?

26:26.452 --> 26:28.022
She said Christy wasn't
going to join us,

26:28.087 --> 26:30.465
that they had gotten into some
kind of fight at the store.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.033
A fight about Nick?

26:32.257 --> 26:33.634
Mercedes didn't say.

26:33.759 --> 26:34.931
She just talked
about her dress.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.734
It was being delivered
that afternoon.

26:36.962 --> 26:38.498
Did you ask her
about the fight?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.770
Yes. She ignored
the question.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.108
Whenever she got
really anxious or

26:43.168 --> 26:44.272
she forgot to take
her medication,

26:44.336 --> 26:45.872
she would just freeze you out.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.609
What kind of medication?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.319
I don't know.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.151
She's always been on
something for something.

26:52.978 --> 26:54.924
I didn't work that Saturday.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.253
I wasn't supposed
to work Sunday either.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.659
But the manager
called me up at home.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.493
Told me to pick up the dress
at the Garrison house

27:01.553 --> 27:03.260
and bring it back for repairs.

27:03.522 --> 27:04.762
What kind of repairs?

27:04.823 --> 27:06.427
We had to replace the sleeve.

27:06.492 --> 27:08.472
Somebody spilled something
on it and tore it.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.140
Is it still here?
Yes.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.902
Can I see it?
Sure.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.742
Did you speak to the Garrisons
when you picked up the dress?

27:15.801 --> 27:19.442
No. The maid, Anna, handed
it to me at the door.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.582
Right or left?
Left.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.616
Hmm.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.952
Yeah, someone spilled
something, all right.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.924
Lab confirmed it's blood.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.464
The rips are bite marks. Bite
pattern matches Christy Garrison's.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.861
So, Mercedes tried on the dress
at home on Sunday. Mmm-hmm.

27:41.026 --> 27:42.937
Christy bites her
for some reason.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.799
Couple of hours later,
Christy's dead.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.974
I guess big sister bit back.

27:54.973 --> 27:58.284
I pick up the phone, and some
politico on the other end

27:58.343 --> 28:00.345
says he owes
Mark Vance a favor.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.857
I turn on the faucet, and someone
he plays golf with falls out.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.124
Now never mind the Vance boys.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.926
It's the Garrison girl.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.864
I don't want to stand up with
egg on our faces either, Adam.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.231
I'm preparing papers
to move on Mercedes.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.295
Can't go near her
with nothing more

28:16.361 --> 28:18.773
than teeth marks
on a wedding dress.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.834
And we stop playing
musical suspects.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.283
The clerk from the store
said she picked up the

28:27.339 --> 28:29.512
wedding dress from
the Garrisons' maid.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.948
The door is closed,
but I hear them fighting.

28:34.179 --> 28:35.351
Did you hear what it was about?

28:35.447 --> 28:38.223
No, I hear yelling.
I don't get the words.

28:38.283 --> 28:41.196
Then someone screams, and
Miss Christy runs out crying.

28:41.286 --> 28:42.287
And Mercedes?

28:42.354 --> 28:46.632
She comes out, too, crying, holding
her arm in her wedding dress.

28:46.959 --> 28:50.702
Miss Pepper, she comes, takes
Mercedes back into the room.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.232
Was this the first
time you saw them fight?

28:53.565 --> 28:57.308
The temporary agency sends
me for help for the wedding.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.474
Two weeks only I was there.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.916
Then Miss Christy dies
No more job.

29:02.174 --> 29:05.383
Anyone else who works in the house
might be closer to the girls?

29:05.978 --> 29:08.788
Elyssa Fuegos. She's
working there many years.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.796
Hey, the Garrisons'
attorney, Peter Behrens,

29:13.852 --> 29:16.355
wants to bring Mercedes in to talk.
This should be interesting.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.798
Well, as of three days
after the murder,

29:17.856 --> 29:20.735
Elyssa Fuegos has been working at the
Garrison villa in Puerto Vallarta.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.100
How nice for her.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.867
She's been working
for the Garrisons

29:23.929 --> 29:25.408
on and off for
the past 20 years.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.000
She was Mercedes' nanny.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.403
Talk to the Feds. Notify
the Mexican authorities.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.503
Let's bring Miss Fuegos
back to New York.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.615
It's been brought to our attention
that you've been talking to people

29:38.677 --> 29:41.817
at Taryn Hsu and
a maid for the Garrisons.

29:42.247 --> 29:43.487
JACK: So what?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.422
We feel the
inevitable is coming.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.025
What's inevitable?

29:49.021 --> 29:50.864
Arresting Mercedes.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.165
We prefer to come forward.

29:53.358 --> 29:56.339
As you probably know by now,
Mercedes isn't well.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.432
She's been under a
doctor's care for years.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.704
Even if she did something,
she's not responsible.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.575
You're conceding
to an "if" now?

30:02.668 --> 30:04.705
No, I'm conceding nothing.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.811
Dr. Dana Ritchie,
attesting to the fact

30:07.873 --> 30:12.151
that she's been Miss Garrison's primary
physician for most of her life

30:12.211 --> 30:16.819
and has prescribed different psychogenics
and tranquilizers in myriad dosages.

30:18.016 --> 30:23.591
Librium, Ativan, Xanax,
Soma, Zoloft, Elavil.

30:23.722 --> 30:28.501
Dr. Paul Terino, psychiatrist.
Valium. She sleepwalks.

30:28.593 --> 30:33.565
Dr. Leslie Sowers, shrink.
Ritalin. She's ADHD.

30:34.700 --> 30:39.911
Dr. Sally Kleiman, behavioral specialist.
Prozac. She's PPD.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.818
Cut to the chase.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.313
Man two. Diminished capacity,

30:46.378 --> 30:49.120
no jail time, she goes into
the GlenAugust Clinic.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.249
CARMICHAEL: GlenAugust?

30:50.949 --> 30:53.259
You're suggesting
she killed her sister,

30:53.418 --> 30:56.888
but a few months of rest and a
high-fiber diet will make it all better?

30:59.958 --> 31:01.460
I just want...

31:02.861 --> 31:05.501
I did something terrible,

31:06.698 --> 31:08.974
and if I can...
It's all right, Mercedes.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.645
Did you know about this,
Mrs. Garrison?

31:15.941 --> 31:16.976
No.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.219
No, I...

31:20.178 --> 31:24.320
I thought there was a chance.
But no, I wasn't sure.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.895
Okay, I think Mr. McCoy
has heard enough.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.092
I don't think so.

31:30.355 --> 31:31.891
Before I agree
to any kind of plea,

31:31.957 --> 31:33.595
I want our shrink
to talk to her.

31:33.792 --> 31:34.896
Oh, I don't know.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.736
I don't see how
we can refuse them.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.273
I remember a fight.

31:49.474 --> 31:51.818
I don't remember what
the fight was about.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.823
Does that happen to you a lot?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.550
That you can't remember things?

31:55.847 --> 31:57.383
Yeah.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.662
I take so many medications.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.701
And some things I remember,

32:05.524 --> 32:08.232
I'm not sure they
really happened.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.904
Your marriage to Nicholas
Vance, is it important to you?

32:13.231 --> 32:16.371
Yeah. It's important
to our families.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.877
I asked if it was
important to you.

32:20.806 --> 32:21.944
Oh, um...

32:22.607 --> 32:23.608
Sure.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.956
I always wanted to be married.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.117
Do you love Nick?

32:30.649 --> 32:31.650
Of course.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.627
Even though he has
other women in his life?

32:37.022 --> 32:39.093
I know he'll take
very good care of me.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.436
What about your sister?

32:45.864 --> 32:47.537
Like her? Hate her?

32:48.066 --> 32:49.340
I loved her.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.848
Uh, I was sent away
when she was born,

32:53.572 --> 32:56.815
and when I came back
she was already there.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.019
I never got to know
her very well.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.415
I regret that.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.823
What was this fight about?

33:11.089 --> 33:13.467
I don't remember what
the fight was about.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.666
Was it about Nick?

33:17.562 --> 33:18.563
No.

33:22.968 --> 33:24.845
Maybe it was about Nick.

33:27.272 --> 33:28.945
It must have been.

33:31.476 --> 33:34.082
Was there another issue
between you and Christy?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.216
No, nothing.

33:38.617 --> 33:39.618
Oh...

33:40.719 --> 33:44.132
She stole some makeup
from me when she was 11.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.734
Um, some jewelry two years ago.

33:49.995 --> 33:50.996
Sister stuff.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.970
Yeah, sister stuff.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.038
How did you feel about
her having sex with Nick?

34:07.979 --> 34:10.219
Christy had a lot of problems.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.696
But your lawyer said
you killed her because

34:14.753 --> 34:17.597
you were enraged when
you saw her with Nick.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.460
Yeah.

34:25.263 --> 34:26.469
Do you remember it?

34:37.275 --> 34:40.279
I detected some big
ugly critter under a rock,

34:40.344 --> 34:42.222
but I wasn't able
to turn it over.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.960
Seeing your sister having sex
with your fiancÃ© is big and ugly.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.288
She's conveniently
forgotten it?

34:49.020 --> 34:50.897
Or she can't bear to remember.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.357
Or?

34:52.657 --> 34:53.965
She never saw it.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.661
But she did kill her sister.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.537
The signals this girl
sends out are so jumbled

34:58.630 --> 35:01.372
I can't tell what she knows,
what she imagines,

35:01.433 --> 35:04.539
what she's done, what she's
convinced herself she did.

35:04.669 --> 35:06.012
The drugs?

35:06.171 --> 35:07.741
That's just one factor.

35:08.306 --> 35:11.253
This woman's been rewired
by a lot of different hands.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.351
So, what do we do
with this plea?

35:15.313 --> 35:16.849
I said I'd have
our guy look at her.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.258
He looked at her. No deal.

35:18.316 --> 35:21.160
(SIGHS) What are you going for?
Jail time? Atrial?

35:21.219 --> 35:23.199
Or are you just going to grind
that family into the dirt?

35:23.255 --> 35:25.257
I'm going to do my job.

35:27.192 --> 35:30.036
Elyssa Fuegos is on a plane
out of Mexico right now.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.832
Our luck, three more suspects'll pop
up before the wheels touch down.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.002
You drag me thousands of miles.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.341
You order me here.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.245
This wouldn't have been
necessary if the Garrisons

35:39.304 --> 35:40.783
hadn't spirited you
out of the country.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.182
There was no subterfuge.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.618
The Garrisons bought the
villa three months ago.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.155
They needed Mrs. Fuegos
to organize the household.

35:47.245 --> 35:49.725
Three days after their
daughter was murdered?

35:50.515 --> 35:53.257
You've worked for the Garrisons
since Mercedes was born?

35:53.351 --> 35:56.093
Except when they moved
for four years to Argentina.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.430
They couldn't afford
to bring me along.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.103
They brought me back when they came
home with the new baby, Christy.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.402
So, you were there that Sunday when
Mercedes and Christy had a fight?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.972
I don't know anything
about a fight.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.609
Christy bit Mercedes?

36:11.369 --> 36:12.871
I don't know about that.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.446
Have the Garrisons
talked to you?

36:17.242 --> 36:19.882
Did they tell you we can put
you in prison for perjury?

36:21.913 --> 36:23.950
These are good people.
Why are you...

36:24.449 --> 36:25.723
Mrs. Fuegos,

36:26.418 --> 36:29.194
they're going to drop you
no matter what you do.

36:29.387 --> 36:33.529
You can't protect them. You can't protect Mercedes.
You can tell the truth.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.539
Mercedes has been charged with murder.
She killed Christy.

36:39.164 --> 36:41.110
What?
She confessed.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.372
She didn't do it. I know.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.341
HOW?

36:50.275 --> 36:51.549
I was with her.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.351
She was sick from her pills.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.252
And what time was this?

36:55.513 --> 36:59.017
She called me just after 2:00 in the morning.
She was throwing up

36:59.684 --> 37:01.163
I stay in her room all night.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.428
Then I woke her up
when the police came.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.560
I can understand why you'd
want to protect Mercedes.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.365
How could you say she did it?

37:08.426 --> 37:11.305
She didn't even remember
I slept in the room with her.

37:11.696 --> 37:14.142
I called the poison
control from her room

37:14.199 --> 37:16.736
because I was concerned
about her pills.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.647
What about
Mr. and Mrs. Garrison?

37:20.238 --> 37:22.218
Did you hear them
get up during the night?

37:22.640 --> 37:23.641
No.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.286
Whose idea was it
to send you to Mexico?

37:28.647 --> 37:30.285
Mrs. Garrison told me.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.022
She said her and
Mr. Garrison wanted

37:33.084 --> 37:35.030
the house ready for
after the wedding.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.733
Mercedes still wanted
to get married to Nick?

37:40.158 --> 37:44.004
Mercedes never knew what
she wanted, except peace.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.302
Thank you, Mrs. Fuegos.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.075
I need to instruct you
not to leave the city

37:50.135 --> 37:52.672
and not to discuss what
you told us with anybody.

37:57.142 --> 37:58.143
(CLEARS THROAT)

37:59.978 --> 38:03.448
Someone convinced Mercedes
to fall on her sword.

38:03.581 --> 38:05.219
Or they convinced
her she did it.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.857
Either way, it turns my stomach.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.965
Plead diminished capacity,
a couple of months rest

38:11.022 --> 38:14.435
at GlenAugust, and Mercedes is
on her way back down the aisle.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.761
So, which one?

38:17.362 --> 38:19.171
Mr. or Mrs. Garrison?

38:19.330 --> 38:21.867
Unless we want to give Adam a
heart attack, we better pick one.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.146
Let's bring in
the whole family.

38:27.172 --> 38:31.052
Elyssa Fuegos said you called her
at around 2:00 in the morning.

38:31.776 --> 38:32.948
You remember that?

38:34.446 --> 38:35.584
I don't know.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.192
You were sick from
your medication.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.588
Miss Fuegos stayed with
you until the morning.

38:41.653 --> 38:45.191
Simply put, Miss Garrison,
you didn't kill your sister.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.336
Elyssa practically
raised Mercedes.

38:49.394 --> 38:50.930
Of course she'd say anything.

38:51.229 --> 38:54.142
She called the poison control
hotline on your daughter's phone.

38:54.265 --> 38:57.735
The phone records confirm a call
was made at 2:57 in the morning.

39:00.605 --> 39:03.245
We believe her, Mrs. Garrison.
Your daughter's innocent.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.055
You told me you saw her do it.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.116
She killed Christy.
That's what you said.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.522
Michael, not here.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.561
For God sake, Paula,
what could you be thinking?

39:12.217 --> 39:14.697
I wanted it to end.
It had to be her.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.054
Why?

39:16.454 --> 39:18.331
Why not that creep, Nick?

39:19.557 --> 39:21.901
We couldn't find a reason Nick
would have killed Christy.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.041
Or his brother, or some maniac.

39:27.799 --> 39:28.800
It's you.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.574
Mercedes, don't...

39:32.003 --> 39:34.882
You did it. You
killed my daughter.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.691
You took her away from me,
and now you've killed her.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.759
Mercedes.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.125
Christy was your daughter.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.863
In Argentina, when I was 14.

39:53.291 --> 39:54.827
Mercedes, not in
front of strangers.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.702
I needed her to know.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.205
That afternoon, I told her.
That's why she was so angry.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.541
We agreed, she was
never supposed to know.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.840
She had a right to know!

40:03.902 --> 40:05.643
And you had a right
to be happy.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.881
She was going to
ruin that, darling.

40:09.874 --> 40:10.875
CARMICHAEL: Ruin what?

40:11.342 --> 40:14.289
Your chances of joining the Mayflower
Tea Club if they ever found out

40:14.345 --> 40:16.347
your daughter was
knocked up at 14?

40:18.383 --> 40:20.056
Is that what
Christy threatened?

40:22.821 --> 40:24.698
You saw her outside
with Nick and Ethan.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.165
JACK: You confronted her.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.267
That's when she
told you she knew?

40:33.631 --> 40:34.735
No.

40:34.799 --> 40:36.301
Oh, my God, Paula.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.580
I am not going
to discuss this here.

40:45.343 --> 40:48.586
Michael, we're leaving.
Mr. Behrens, tell him.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.284
Mr. Garrison,
we should leave.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.460
You, too, Mercedes.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.942
Mrs. Garrison, I suggest you
get yourself an attorney.

41:18.509 --> 41:21.922
Briscoe, Green and a bucket of cops
have been over that house, Jack.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.256
And? They found a
pantsuit of Pepper's.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.761
Elyssa confirms Pepper was wearing
it the night of the murder.

41:26.851 --> 41:27.852
Blood splatters?

41:27.919 --> 41:30.058
If we had both parts
of the pantsuit.

41:30.522 --> 41:32.502
They found the pants
but not the jacket.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.693
Can I see you two in here?

41:38.296 --> 41:41.368
You know the Vances.
They have something to say.

41:43.434 --> 41:46.608
What our sons did
was inexcusable.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.511
We're dealing
with them harshly.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.517
You've come to make
apologies for your sons?

41:54.646 --> 41:57.388
We've come to tell you
who killed Christy Garrison.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.856
That night, we heard
Nick come in.

42:03.988 --> 42:06.366
I wanted to know what he'd
gotten into this time.

42:06.624 --> 42:08.160
I stopped him on the stairs.

42:08.226 --> 42:13.141
We heard noises outside. Yelling.
Our room is over the service alley.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.238
Christy was screaming at Pepper.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.938
MARK: Christy
was attacking her.

42:17.001 --> 42:20.778
I ran down the stairs, got outside.
Christy was sliding down the wall.

42:20.838 --> 42:24.115
Christy was rushing
her, striking her.

42:24.642 --> 42:26.519
Pepper didn't have a choice.

42:26.578 --> 42:27.784
Christy was dead.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.359
Pepper was inconsolable. I...

42:30.748 --> 42:33.024
I told her to go inside
We'd handle it.

42:33.251 --> 42:37.461
It was an act of cowardice on our parts
that we didn't come forward earlier.

42:37.522 --> 42:40.332
You kept silent when your
sons were suspected of murder.

42:41.592 --> 42:42.593
Why?

42:42.660 --> 42:45.163
We knew they hadn't done it.
That they'd be released.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.231
CARMICHAEL: And when
Mercedes was arrested?

42:47.298 --> 42:50.472
She hadn't done it.
She's fragile.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.477
MARIANNA: We knew
that would come out.

42:52.737 --> 42:56.446
And you good Samaritans come forward
now because... All right, Jack.

42:56.841 --> 42:58.912
I'm sorry, Adam. It's just
so damned convenient.

42:58.976 --> 43:03.049
Pepper is accused of murder. It was self-defense.
We saw it. We can help.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.021
(SIGHS)

43:10.888 --> 43:12.333
You know where to find us.

43:12.390 --> 43:13.994
We'll be of whatever
help we can.

43:23.334 --> 43:26.338
I think we can make a case for
murder against Pepper Garrison.

43:26.404 --> 43:27.883
The case is self-defense.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.680
We can go for it, Adam.

43:29.741 --> 43:31.880
The girl was
hopped up on drugs.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.216
Vances are impeccable witnesses.

43:35.413 --> 43:39.418
And Pepper Garrison has a
rock-solid affirmative defense.

43:39.851 --> 43:41.762
Never get a conviction.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.231
CARMICHAEL: Society page,
the long awaited honeymoon

43:50.295 --> 43:52.866
of Nicholas and Mercedes Vance.

43:53.331 --> 43:54.332
Greece.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.041
Must be lovely
this time of year.

43:58.436 --> 43:59.915
Take a look.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.612
Page is marked.

44:02.473 --> 44:05.852
Vance Affiliated Industries
announces a huge infusion

44:05.910 --> 44:09.289
of cash and stock
from its new partner,

44:09.380 --> 44:11.621
the Garrison Investment Group.

44:13.718 --> 44:15.129
This was a merger.

44:15.787 --> 44:17.494
It was never a marriage.

44:20.291 --> 44:22.202
The laws for the
rich are different.

44:24.395 --> 44:26.397
What laws for the rich?

44:27.305 --> 44:33.859
