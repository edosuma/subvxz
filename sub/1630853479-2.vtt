WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:04.421
I'm Tom Swift,
inventor, billionaire,

00:04.462 --> 00:06.339
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.341
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.510
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

00:10.552 --> 00:11.845
I could earn his love,

00:11.886 --> 00:14.389
but his mission
ended tragically.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.433
Or so I thought.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.309
Turns out, he was sabotaged.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.104
My father survived the attack
and sent me a message capsule

00:21.146 --> 00:23.106
with the data I need
to rescue him from space,

00:23.148 --> 00:26.192
but it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.777
Now I have to find the pieces
of that capsule

00:27.819 --> 00:30.864
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.782
A global conspiracy
called The Road Back

00:32.824 --> 00:35.410
is standing in my way,
so I can only trust my squad:

00:35.452 --> 00:37.871
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

00:37.912 --> 00:42.042
my adopted brother Lino,
and my AI Barclay.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.835
Together, we're going
to find my father

00:43.877 --> 00:45.128
and bring him home.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.674
♪ Now work, come on,
work, yeah ♪

00:49.716 --> 00:51.634
♪ I'm about to get it,
I'm about to get it... ♪

00:51.676 --> 00:55.388
BARCLAY:
Tom, we're 100 yards
from the capsule piece I found.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.223
We'll have to go on foot.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.601
Zenzi, you didn't wear heels,
did you?

00:59.642 --> 01:01.352
No, but you did.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.979
Jodhpur boots have
a natural lift, okay?
Uh-huh, yeah.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.355
How much
of your father's message

01:04.397 --> 01:05.690
is in each capsule piece?

01:05.732 --> 01:08.068
We won't know
until we reassemble it.

01:08.109 --> 01:11.404
ZENZI:
Wait, that's a capsule piece?

01:11.446 --> 01:13.990
No, it's just wreckage.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.658
Putting this capsule
back together is gonna be

01:15.700 --> 01:17.994
more difficult than I thought.

ZENZI:
The capsule piece

01:35.678 --> 01:37.639
we're tracking
is the "brain," right?

01:37.680 --> 01:39.641
Yeah, and it unlocks
the other pieces.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.309
Without it, we're screwed.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.852
I don't understand
what happened.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.896
I-I don't think
Barclay messed up,

01:44.938 --> 01:47.565
but I did build him
when I was eight.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.817
I'm running a defrag

01:48.858 --> 01:50.485
and a source code analysis
just in case.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.654
Oh, could you translate that
out of nerd?

01:52.695 --> 01:55.490
Okay, think day spa
but for an AI.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.825
A software mani-pedi,

01:56.866 --> 01:58.868
then recalculating
the landing vectors by hand.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.453
I'd translate,
but you'd only understand

02:00.495 --> 02:02.247
if you hadn't gotten
a four on AP calc.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.333
Oh, did I get a four, or
did I tell you I got a four

02:05.375 --> 02:07.168
to make you feel cool?

02:07.210 --> 02:09.796
Don't come for me.
I'll hack your test scores.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.798
And I'll post
your eighth grade school photo.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.051
Ooh, remember when you
tried the one-brow look?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.636
O-Okay, okay, you cannot let
Isaac see that.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.055
I have a reputation to protect.
(chuckles) Oh, ooh.

02:19.097 --> 02:24.644
Speaking of Isaac,
he mentioned an ex-girlfriend.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.020
Mm-hmm.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.106
(through teeth):
I thought he was gay.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.026
He watches your shirt move
when you yawn.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.862
I can't help it
if he enjoys the ab show.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.321
Many people do.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.282
Yeah, I know. I've
seen the IG comments.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.492
Okay, a lot of those
people need to pray.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.871
Yes. So he's trans and bi...?

02:42.912 --> 02:45.165
No, he's not bi.
He's pansexual.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.624
He's open to falling in love
with people

02:46.666 --> 02:48.209
across the gender spectrum.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.296
Hmm, well, judging from
how he brings you coffee,

02:51.337 --> 02:53.298
he's Tomsexual.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.301
And I don't date men
who are interested in Tom Swift.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.013
BARCLAY:
Operating level:

03:00.054 --> 03:01.556
Beyoncé Formation Tour.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.724
What did I miss?

03:02.765 --> 03:04.017
(sighs)
Thank God you're back.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.310
I used the satellite data
I got from Justin

03:05.351 --> 03:07.896
to model the size
of each capsule piece.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.689
Yeah, to show how
all the missing pieces

03:09.731 --> 03:11.191
will eventually fit
back together.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.484
Now, Barclay,
remind us what it looked like

03:13.526 --> 03:14.861
when the capsule broke apart.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.613
BARCLAY:
The heat of the reentry

03:16.654 --> 03:18.489
threw off my ability to lock on.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.868
Okay, I did some vectoring
to recalculate a landing point

03:21.910 --> 03:23.578
for the actual capsule.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.247
Ooh, Zenzi,
shame about that four.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.416
Sorry, we're gonna have
a couple more math words here.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.751
Stream to map.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.960
ZENZI:
If you hadn't
been so busy

03:31.002 --> 03:32.170
flirting with the proctors

03:32.212 --> 03:34.255
that got you that two
on AP geography,

03:34.297 --> 03:37.050
you'd know that's
the Darby estate.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.510
Chris Darby?
Mm.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.929
I hate that family.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.641
They are pretentious
and rude and...

03:44.682 --> 03:45.975
Kind to us all the time.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.269
Isaac, they're lovely people.

03:48.311 --> 03:48.937
I'll reserve judgment.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.772
BARCLAY:
The Darby estate
was built in 1937

03:50.813 --> 03:52.190
when the family discovered oil.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.234
They are literally
oil barons.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.778
How cliché. Look,
who even uses gas?

03:56.819 --> 03:58.154
Your private jet.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.781
The resources are protected

03:59.822 --> 04:02.659
by a state-of-the-art
security barrier.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.869
30 feet tall,
steel and concrete,

04:04.911 --> 04:06.537
countermeasures unknown.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.790
Why would your father
send it there?

04:08.831 --> 04:11.876
Couldn't it just land here?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.461
He needed to protect it.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.129
If he sent it here, it could
end up in the neighbor's pool

04:15.171 --> 04:16.798
or smash through a coffee shop.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.635
Yeah, the Darbys have over
200 acres for it to roam.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.136
Should I DM Chris?

04:22.178 --> 04:24.889
No. Look, we can't tell anyone.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.141
We don't know who's been
compromised by The Road Back,

04:27.183 --> 04:29.894
or what they'll do to us if
they know my dad is still alive.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.897
What are the angles, Isaac?

04:32.939 --> 04:33.898
It looks impenetrable.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.483
TOM:
How about explosives?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.151
ZENZI:
Can we try

04:37.193 --> 04:39.028
asking nicely?

04:39.070 --> 04:39.988
A dinner?

04:40.029 --> 04:42.365
An expensive
bottle of wine?

04:42.740 --> 04:47.078
Are we saving your dad or not?

04:49.205 --> 04:50.915
(door opens)

04:50.957 --> 04:51.958
(door closes)

04:52.000 --> 04:53.418
LORRAINE:
I am out of shape.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.669
Are you kidding?
I'm serious.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.588
Hey, Mom. Hi, interloper.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.424
I need to talk to my mom.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.343
Can you go sweat through
a shirt somewhere else?

05:02.385 --> 05:05.972
Thomas Alexander Winston Swift,
apologize to Claire at once.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.725
You're full-government-name mad?

05:08.766 --> 05:11.102
(sighs)

05:11.144 --> 05:13.855
I'm sorry, Claire.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.523
Can I get you a glass of water?

05:15.565 --> 05:18.443
You know, as always,
you look parched, girl.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.029
Tom, I am only here to help.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.490
I'd be a great mentor
if you would let me.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.617
Thanks, Claire.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.702
Bye.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.162
Bye-bye. See you, dear.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.997
(laughs softly)

05:32.206 --> 05:35.585
Mm. I do not understand
your distaste for her.

05:35.626 --> 05:36.961
You know, she's my friend.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.757
She plays tennis
in track pants and a headband.

05:40.798 --> 05:41.883
Is she 12?

05:41.924 --> 05:44.677
(laughs):
You are incorrigible.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.056
I try. So, I need a favor.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.892
Plan a dinner
with the Darbys.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.227
There's a mineral
on their property that I think

05:53.269 --> 05:55.480
could be a powerful
fuel source.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.939
But you know them.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.066
They won't let me explore

05:58.107 --> 05:59.359
without kissing
their asses first.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.777
(grunts softly)

06:00.818 --> 06:02.653
Well, they did tell us
they'd love to see us

06:02.695 --> 06:05.907
after the funeral, but people
never mean those things.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.200
Well, pretend they did.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.577
We'll have a casual,
somewhat boring meal,

06:09.619 --> 06:11.871
you'll help me out, and...

06:14.207 --> 06:15.625
What's wrong?

06:17.502 --> 06:21.047
It's my first social event
since your father.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.548
You know, he was always...

06:22.590 --> 06:24.884
he always made these
things so easy.

06:24.926 --> 06:29.180
Well, I guess I can plan
a menu and wear black,

06:29.222 --> 06:31.724
and try not to slap someone

06:31.766 --> 06:33.518
if I hear "everything
happens for a reason."

06:33.559 --> 06:36.229
No, I don't want you
to go through that.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.605
I'll take care of it.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.898
No, no, no, no. If you need me

06:38.940 --> 06:41.901
to arrange this dinner,
I'll do it.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.195
Thank you.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.572
And after the dinner,

06:46.614 --> 06:49.200
there are some things
that we need to discuss

06:49.242 --> 06:50.743
about the Tubman
Social Group.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.954
I will be
your attentive student.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.539
Right after we charm the Darbys.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.416
And I expect you
to be on your best behavior.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.460
And wear something
respectable.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.421
Like your father's cuff links.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.216
(beeping)

07:09.387 --> 07:12.515
August 30, 1983.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.975
The day Guion Bluford,

07:14.016 --> 07:17.019
the first Black man to
go to space, took off.

07:17.061 --> 07:20.064
Remember how we cracked
this open when we were 15?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.482
(both laugh)
Uh-huh.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.734
I got in and out so easily,
my dad never noticed

07:23.776 --> 07:25.403
that his watches
went missing on Friday

07:25.445 --> 07:27.280
and didn't come back
until Sunday night.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.949
This would make Jay-Z
feel broke.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.577
Actually, I heard he came
to a fundraiser here once,

07:32.618 --> 07:35.913
stopped rapping,
started buying stocks.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.332
Mm-hmm.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.632
BARCLAY:
It's in my memory cache,

07:46.674 --> 07:48.301
but I can't find
the creation metadata.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.471
I've been trying to figure out
why this photo is here at all.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.848
It's the congressman's
bodyguard Rowan.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.683
Wait. Wait,
this is from last week,

07:55.725 --> 07:57.226
when you spoke
to the congressman.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.270
ROWAN:
Watch your tone

07:59.312 --> 08:01.522
when you're talking
to the congressman.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.399
ISAAC:
Rowan put his hand
on your shoulder

08:03.441 --> 08:05.109
during that meeting,
as I recall.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.444
Tom didn't seem to mind.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.987
(stammers)
What if Barclay

08:08.029 --> 08:11.240
held onto his image
because Rowan used that moment

08:11.282 --> 08:12.992
in the office to compromise him?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.327
We need to shut down your...

08:14.368 --> 08:15.912
I fixed him. It's fine.

08:15.953 --> 08:19.373
A-And Barclay is not a device.
He's my friend.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.501
We need him to
locate that capsule.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.585
And his internal audio
and camera

08:22.627 --> 08:24.045
are on a closed loop anyway,

08:24.086 --> 08:25.630
so nobody can eavesdrop on us.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.132
Everything's gonna be okay.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.967
BARCLAY:
I tracked the location
of the capsule piece.

08:30.009 --> 08:30.968
It's in their drill mines.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.053
Oh, that...

08:32.094 --> 08:33.471
is supposed to be dangerous.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.349
Something about acid and vines.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.059
Did you ever
go in them?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.186
Portions of the property were
corrupted by drilling runoff...

08:40.228 --> 08:42.772
Okay, we don't need to hear
any more.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.942
I'm not going in those mines.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.277
♪ ♪

08:53.866 --> 08:56.786
Uh... (scoffs) you're
not going into the mines?

08:56.827 --> 08:58.079
We'll find another way.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.956
And if we can't?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.207
Wow.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.751
You look wonderful.
(chuckles softly)

09:03.793 --> 09:06.420
Your father would be proud.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.882
CHRIS:
So excited to see you.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.175
Oh.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.010
Zenzi.
Hmm?

09:13.052 --> 09:15.012
What text has you
smiling like that?

09:15.054 --> 09:16.806
Oh, it's from
Chris Darby.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.892
(groans)
I wonder if he's still
with that Delta from UPenn.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.436
Barclay, when was the last time

09:22.478 --> 09:26.357
Chris posted a simple-looking
girl with a flea market purse?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.733
BARCLAY:
Ten weeks ago.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.111
And it looks like
she's deleted him from hers.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.696
Oh, he's single.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.406
That's interesting.
Yeah, Chris is smart.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.825
He's Black. We
grew up together.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.578
It could be, as Aunt
Lorraine says, interesting.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.622
Chris "trifling
and also bucktoothed" Darby

09:41.664 --> 09:43.207
is interesting?
He is not bucktoothed anymore.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.750
He's pretentious.
He's rude.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.794
And he thinks he's
the smartest person in the room.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.754
Oh, so you don't like
him because he's you?

09:48.796 --> 09:50.172
Now, now, Zenzi, Tom,

09:50.214 --> 09:52.466
the Darbys are just
a little extra.

09:52.508 --> 09:56.345
You know, it's the constant
one-upsmanship I can't stand.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.098
TOM: Mm.
And they are obsessed with
keeping up with the Joneses.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.600
Or the Swifts.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.226
Remember
when Dad special-ordered

10:02.268 --> 10:03.894
that blue Maybach?
Oh.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.355
(chuckles)
And Mr. Darby hired
a private detective

10:06.397 --> 10:07.773
to find him one
in the same color.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.108
ZENZI:
People buy

10:09.150 --> 10:11.235
blue cars.
Mm.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.612
Maybe he just liked it.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.656
(doorbell rings)
Or maybe they're tacky,

10:15.698 --> 10:18.034
thirsty and pressed.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.495
(exhaling):
Ooh.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.830
Okay.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.332
I got that out. Yeah.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.083
Let's go kiss some Darby ass.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.252
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey ♪

10:28.294 --> 10:30.504
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. ♪

10:30.921 --> 10:34.592
A toast to our most
gracious friends

10:34.634 --> 10:36.093
Mr. and Mrs. Darby--

10:36.135 --> 10:37.637
and Chris.
We are so moved

10:37.678 --> 10:40.723
that you'd join us for
dinner on such short notice.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.683
We're happy to be here, Tom.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.976
CHRIS:
I thought you invited us here

10:44.018 --> 10:45.478
instead of
coming to dinner

10:45.519 --> 10:47.980
at our house because you
still thought our ancestral home

10:48.022 --> 10:49.482
was a tacky tract house

10:49.523 --> 10:51.025
that smelled
like feet.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.777
(chuckles)
Did I say that?

10:52.818 --> 10:54.028
Oh, yeah.
Uh, you know what?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.404
I just needed to mature

10:55.446 --> 10:58.658
before I could appreciate
sophisticated design.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.700
Oh, uh-huh.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.701
VERNON:
Zenzi,

11:00.743 --> 11:02.036
are you back
permanently?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.371
Mm. Yes.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.955
All done
with Atlanta.
Mm.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.999
And done with that
Marcus, I hope.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.334
See, I never
understood you two.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.670
It never seemed
like a, a good fit.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.672
So this is, uh...

11:12.713 --> 11:13.881
this is good news for me.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.675
(Phyllis and Vernon chuckle)

11:15.716 --> 11:16.926
How are you holding up?

11:16.967 --> 11:19.053
You know, everything
happens for a reason.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.388
VERNON:
Mm-hmm.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.726
And with friends
like you all

11:25.768 --> 11:27.687
to support us through
this difficult time,

11:27.728 --> 11:31.524
I'm sure we'll be able
to manage this weight.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.109
Zenzi,

11:33.109 --> 11:35.986
I thought that your speech
at the memorial

11:36.028 --> 11:38.072
was absolutely beautiful.
VERNON: Mm-hmm.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.074
It was touching.
It was moving.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.742
It was everything
a eulogy should be.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.494
Yes, yes, it was.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.287
Yes.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.165
Well, words sometimes fail us.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.377
But Tom's actions to
build the company speak

11:51.419 --> 11:53.587
for themselves.
Mm-hmm.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.091
I used to love your
pool parties so much.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.677
(laughter, assenting)

11:59.719 --> 12:01.554
The giant, giant

12:01.595 --> 12:03.097
ice cream trucks.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.516
Ice cream sandwiches. Yes.
(laughing): Yeah.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.185
You loved those, Tom.
(chewing sounds)

12:08.227 --> 12:10.938
Yeah. Yeah, I sure did.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.940
My favorite.
(laughs)

12:12.982 --> 12:14.483
Thank God for
cardio, right?

12:14.525 --> 12:16.235
(laughter)
Look at your boy now.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.070
Remember you used to follow
the lifeguard around?

12:18.112 --> 12:19.947
PHYLLIS:
Oh.
Oh, yeah, he was about 20.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.574
He went to
Sarah Lawrence.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.909
(laughter)
Oh, you were obsessed with him.

12:23.951 --> 12:28.038
Zenzi, uh, didn't Tom
steal one of his, um...

12:28.080 --> 12:29.248
his Speedos?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.125
Wait, uh,
you-you did what?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.210
A lifeguard? I-I did not

12:33.252 --> 12:34.754
do anything.
Yes. He had
to drive home

12:34.795 --> 12:36.046
in a towel.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.256
Your dad found it
in your backpack.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.175
(laughs)
ZENZI:
Yeah, no,

12:39.216 --> 12:40.593
I-I think I remember this.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.595
VERNON:
Well, I certainly remember.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.138
Remember we had
to pay him double.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.974
A little boy-crush fee.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.477
(laughter)

12:49.769 --> 12:51.437
Hey, guys, he-he left it

12:51.479 --> 12:52.980
in the bathroom and I
just brought it back.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.857
It was-- No
towel involved.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.317
It's okay, Tom.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.151
I looked

12:57.193 --> 12:58.152
at a few bras myself.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.320
Mm.
I never,

12:59.361 --> 13:01.238
uh, took any home with me,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.032
but, you know...
(laughs)

13:03.073 --> 13:04.492
(laughter)

13:04.533 --> 13:06.869
Oh. Wait, your
dad was so upset.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.497
He was yelling
his son had, um...

13:10.247 --> 13:11.248
...sugar in his tank.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.626
Yes.
(laughter)

13:13.667 --> 13:14.168
You see, I'm
just so glad

13:14.210 --> 13:16.337
you guys got to a
place of acceptance.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.005
That...

13:18.047 --> 13:19.799
never... happened.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.925
Oh.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.218
(Tom sighs)

13:22.259 --> 13:24.512
You know, we're having

13:24.553 --> 13:27.681
such a lovely time
laughing at my expense.

13:27.723 --> 13:30.309
But you know what
I think is funny?

13:30.351 --> 13:33.854
My parents and I
have always had big laughs

13:33.896 --> 13:37.316
over how every time
we buy something-- mm-hmm...

13:37.358 --> 13:39.735
(chuckles)
the exact same thing

13:39.777 --> 13:42.488
ends up at your place
after you see it.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.489
Hmm?

13:43.531 --> 13:44.365
Hmm?

13:44.406 --> 13:46.242
It-It's
almost like...

13:46.283 --> 13:48.786
you guys are so
desperately insecure

13:48.828 --> 13:51.497
that you have no choice
but to copy and paste...

13:51.539 --> 13:53.123
(clears throat)
...yourself a life

13:53.165 --> 13:54.250

that's...

13:56.043 --> 13:57.419

My pleasure.
I love secret recon.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.170
I wasn't able
to access blueprints,

heat tracking...

30:22.695 --> 30:24.989
Oh, you're not the only one

This is Camille.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.953
Oh, hey, Camille.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.996
Camille, could you tell Zenzi
to cut this beam

30:32.038 --> 30:33.289
and skip the attitude?

30:33.331 --> 30:34.999
Oh, are we skipping attitude?
Yeah.

30:35.041 --> 30:39.254
Will we also be skipping quips
for the remainder of the day?

30:53.309 --> 30:54.477
And now you say...

30:54.519 --> 30:56.855
Thank you, Zenzi.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.440
(whirring)

31:07.907 --> 31:10.493
My nanobots will latch into
the mining lanterns

31:10.535 --> 31:12.412
and give us...

31:14.873 --> 31:16.457
The capsule piece.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.960
Okay, let's grab this
and get out.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.503
(beeps)
Okay.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.130
He added a security layer
in case someone else found it.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.632
We need to disarm this
or it's going to self-destruct.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.468
Okay, a raised fist
and the sun.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.680
Maybe the power of sunrise.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.349
(beeps)
Okay, um...

31:33.391 --> 31:36.227
Oh, oh, try "From
the rising of the sun

31:36.269 --> 31:37.687
"to the place where it sets,

31:37.729 --> 31:39.731
the name of the Lord
is to be praised."

31:39.772 --> 31:42.400
(beeps)

31:42.442 --> 31:43.985
Uh...

31:44.027 --> 31:45.904

31:46.654 --> 31:48.615

(both groan)

31:48.656 --> 31:50.909
Oh, one attempt remaining.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.869
Of course he couldn't
make this easy.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.622
It had to be one
of his stupid lessons.
Look, I'm sure he thought

31:55.663 --> 31:57.457
that you would be able to...
Would you stop?

31:57.498 --> 32:01.669
I can be right about
my own father and Chris

32:01.711 --> 32:03.671
without you poking holes
in everything that I say.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.590
Yeah, well, if I had been
given all the information

32:05.632 --> 32:07.592
I needed, I wouldn't need
to question you.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.011
And you can't get mad at me
for asking questions

32:10.053 --> 32:11.596
when you're the one
who's been keeping secrets

32:11.638 --> 32:13.514
for ten damn years.
Oh!

32:13.556 --> 32:15.683
So I'm supposed to
humiliate myself

32:15.725 --> 32:17.936
so you can ask me if it's true.

32:19.979 --> 32:21.481
Secrets aren't always bad.

32:22.690 --> 32:25.652
I know that my dad
paid your tuition.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.612
I never said anything
because, Zenzi,

32:27.654 --> 32:29.781
I didn't want you
to be embarrassed.

32:31.199 --> 32:35.370
Tom Swift doesn't get bullied
or called too gay.

32:35.411 --> 32:37.789
And I didn't want to
be embarrassed either.

32:37.830 --> 32:42.377
Well, I can't have your back
if you keep things from me.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.754
Even if they are embarrassing.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.553
BOTH:
I'm sorry.

32:52.595 --> 32:54.681
Okay, look, let's just get
this capsule piece,

32:54.722 --> 32:57.850
and then never speak
to the Darbys again.

32:57.892 --> 33:02.605
Okay, a Black Power fist
and the sun.

33:02.647 --> 33:06.567
To be kept safe, um...

33:07.485 --> 33:10.363
Wait. To be kept safe,

33:10.405 --> 33:13.116
like the watch safe.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.283
(chimes)

33:14.325 --> 33:15.910
Whoo!

33:15.952 --> 33:18.079
Yes!
First Black astronaut
in space.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.414
(exhales sharply)

33:19.455 --> 33:22.166
I guess my dad knew
about the missing watches.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.293
(both laugh)

33:26.796 --> 33:28.589
(whirring)

33:29.549 --> 33:30.925
I thought I told you two

33:30.967 --> 33:33.720
to stay off
my family's property.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.318
Is there some jackass quota
you have to meet every day?

33:49.360 --> 33:50.653
You broke in.
You're stealing.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.030
I could literally be
doing anything, Chris,

33:52.071 --> 33:54.741
and you would still
come for me.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.702
I-I was-- I was
nice to you,

33:57.744 --> 33:59.829
and you were a dick.

33:59.871 --> 34:00.997
And now I'm not nice,
and surprise,

34:01.039 --> 34:02.999
you are still a dick.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.002
You know, in the cliché
version of this story,

34:06.044 --> 34:08.337
this is where the bully
reveals that he's gay.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.339
So let's get to you
on your knees

34:10.381 --> 34:12.633
so I can get something
good out of this.

34:15.386 --> 34:16.763
That's what I thought.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.599
Do you have any idea
what it's like

34:19.640 --> 34:23.061
to be compared to Tom Swift?

34:23.102 --> 34:27.774
My family owns rocks.
You build rocket ships!

34:27.815 --> 34:29.734
I've spent my entire life
hearing my parents say,

34:29.776 --> 34:31.903
"Why can't you be
more like Tom?"

34:34.405 --> 34:37.450
You're... jealous.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.788
Not... not no.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.501
Your father was
so proud of you.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.879
And he left you
this-this legacy.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.256
I don't have that.

34:52.298 --> 34:56.677
My dad said that
he's proud of Tom?

34:57.678 --> 34:59.430
Aloud?

35:04.769 --> 35:07.230
This is our parents' mess,

35:07.271 --> 35:09.398
not ours, Chris.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.817
They pit us against each other,

35:10.858 --> 35:13.611
and now we're just
playing out their fight.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.655
We don't even know
each other for real.

35:17.657 --> 35:20.701
I am sorry for adding to that.

35:22.411 --> 35:23.913
But we can stop it.

35:23.955 --> 35:27.667
Look, I'll make Darby Minerals

35:27.708 --> 35:29.627
an official Swift vendor.

35:29.669 --> 35:34.423
That way we share a legacy.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.053
(laughs softly)

35:53.526 --> 35:55.778
I'm sorry about that.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.530
All right, let's have dinner.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.616

36:00.658 --> 36:03.828

trim my eyelashes

36:07.999 --> 36:11.878

go to dinner with you again.

Isaac, I just figured out
what's wrong with Barclay.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.264
It's a tracking algorithm.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.225
It's sending all of our data
to an unknown destination.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.311

incomplete blips of video

40:39.353 --> 40:39.979

But if the spyware breaches
Barclay's firewall,

40:43.607 --> 40:47.194
it can start to relay
full video and audio, too.
