00:15.149 --> 00:16.250
Previously on Blunt Talk...

00:16.350 --> 00:18.719
Duncan Adler has been
linking Rudolph Global

00:18.819 --> 00:21.655
to the killing of LA's
recycled water plant in 2001.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.225
Anyway, there's a vote
coming up, Proposition 68,

00:24.325 --> 00:25.993
to try to reopen
the plant.

00:26.094 --> 00:30.264
So the question is,
why are they against
recycled water

00:30.364 --> 00:32.032
when LA so clearly
needs it?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.834
Until all
the charges are dropped,

00:34.034 --> 00:36.070
you are suspended.
No!

00:36.170 --> 00:39.073
Rudolph Global
is a dangerous corporation.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.242
They need to be exposed.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.711
I happen to care
about Rudolph Global,
Mr. Blunt.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.414
Evelyn wants me to escort her
to another fundraiser

00:46.514 --> 00:48.416
and it's at
Daniel Rudolph's house.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.418
And if we can get you alone
with Rudolph,

00:50.518 --> 00:53.154
maybe you could
get him talking
and secretly tape him

00:53.254 --> 00:54.722
like old-school
Mike Wallace.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.257
Oh, I like that.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.092
Leave my brother
alone, Walter.

00:58.192 --> 01:01.495
Put the gun down, Margaret.
You're not really going
to shoot us.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.731
Turn around!
I fucking mean it!

01:23.184 --> 01:25.253
Margaret,
don't be foolish.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.389
You can't shoot
intruders in the back.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.658
It won't
look good for you.

01:36.164 --> 01:39.167
Is this all because
I didn't call?

01:39.233 --> 01:43.271
If so, I apologize,
Margaret, profoundly.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.606
You see, I didn't know
we were dating.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.276
Well, that's not the only
reason, but it didn't help.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.011
I liked kissing
you all over.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.181
I liked the way
you smell.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.683
But you've had people
killed, Margaret.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.018
A dear friend of mine
was assaulted.

01:58.186 --> 02:01.021
You framed us
for murder. Why?

02:01.189 --> 02:03.191
Because my brother
is useless

02:03.257 --> 02:08.061
and it's been up to me
to protect what my handsome
father built from nothing.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.030
But Rudolph Global
is worth billions.

02:10.198 --> 02:14.067
How much more do you want
and why deprive the people

02:14.202 --> 02:15.736
of Los Angeles
of clean water?

02:15.836 --> 02:19.039
I'm not.
Water recycling
is disgusting.

02:19.207 --> 02:22.109
Diarrhea is the number one
cause of death in the world.

02:22.210 --> 02:26.214
I won't have that
happen to LA even if
it means killing you.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.283
Drop the gun, lady.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.886
Bravo, Jim!
Over there, please.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.688
Over there, please.
Thank you.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.391
I'm a hero.
Drop the gun,
beekeeper.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.228
Ah, damn it.
Come here. Come on.
Let's go. Over there.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.296
Thank you, Barry.
I'm gonna call the police

02:42.396 --> 02:43.464
and tell them
we have intruders.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.266
Let's check them
for wires first.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.602
I don't trust journalists,
not in this day and age.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.639
Holy shit, is that
decorative flower
a camera?

02:51.739 --> 02:52.540
No.
No.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.974
Drop the gun,
sea horse.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.343
Oh, damn it.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.245
Well done, Celia!

02:57.311 --> 02:58.879
Come on,
let's get out of here.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.482
Oh, there you are, Jim.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.252
Look what I got.
Booger sugar.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.287
In time for sunrise.
Yeah, okay, l-let's go.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.855
What?
Let's go, Evelyn.
Jesus.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.259
Oh, hello, Margaret.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.394
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

03:13.494 --> 03:16.430
Come! Come!
Quickly!

03:19.533 --> 03:21.835
Right, sir.
Well done, Harry.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.440
Come on, Major.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.680
Where's my car?
Quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick!

03:32.780 --> 03:35.783
Thank you.
Meow.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.551
I don't think there's
enough room for everybody.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.420
Come with me, Major.
I have an idea.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.088
You three take off.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.823
You drive, sir.

03:42.923 --> 03:46.527
Oh, are we doing
the right thing, Harry?
Yes, Major.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.497
We'll return it
with a full tank
of gas-- gas later.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.832
Uh, goggles, sir.
Oh, thank you.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.635
We'd better go, sir,
before the police arrive.
Yes, Harry.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.338
Go, go!

03:57.438 --> 03:59.340
Stop, you crazy bitches!

03:59.440 --> 04:01.542
Crap! Fuck! Crap!

04:12.320 --> 04:14.455
Faster, Celia.
He's right behind us.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.324
I am going as fast
as I can, Jim.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.428
This is fun.
Floor it!

04:24.532 --> 04:25.666
Shit!

04:29.403 --> 04:31.772
Yes.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.977
He's passed her, sir.
Do something, Harry!

04:40.914 --> 04:42.350
What the fuck?

04:42.450 --> 04:44.652
I've slowed him up, sir.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.420
Shit!

04:50.624 --> 04:52.960
He's stopping, sir.
He's pulled off the road.

04:53.060 --> 04:53.994
Yes!

04:54.094 --> 04:55.663
Empty?
God damn it.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.365
I just filled it up
two months ago.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.667
Fantastic, Harry.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.469
Attaboy.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.488
Hello in there.

05:20.588 --> 05:24.024
Um, my name is Martin.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.826
I have a lot of debt.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.800
Can you hear me?

05:32.900 --> 05:35.436
Testing, testing.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.605
I think
it's working, Major.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.873
I hope so.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.277
How do I look, Major?

05:44.412 --> 05:47.047
Very pretty, Harry.

05:47.147 --> 05:50.684
Just for tonight, sir,
this one extraordinary night

05:50.784 --> 05:53.487
when I get to be
a beautiful woman,

05:53.587 --> 05:55.523
could you call me Harriet?

05:55.623 --> 05:58.291
All right, Harry.
No, Harriet, please.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.429
Jim, just forward
the damn thing.
Uh, sorry, Walter.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.532
Y-you see, I always wanted
to be like Tiresias,

06:04.632 --> 06:07.267
half man, half woman,
all-knowing.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.802
I get it.
When I was a kid,

06:08.902 --> 06:10.804
I used to dress up like
a girl every Halloween.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.441
Now stop when Margaret
Rudolph is visible.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.476
Yes, Walter.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.911
But you've had people
killed, Margaret.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.448
A dear friend of mine
was assaulted.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.451
You framed us
for murder. Why?

06:23.517 --> 06:26.554
Because my brother
is useless

06:26.654 --> 06:31.559
and it's been up to me
to protect what my handsome
father built from nothing.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.894
What do you think,
gentlemen?
I like her antlers.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.797
Yeah, they're beautiful.
But she does seem homicidal.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.699
I'll let my friend the DA
know what's going on.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.535
You boys lift up the bath mat
on Rudolph Global

06:41.635 --> 06:43.136
and some ugly stuff
is gonna crawl out.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.806
I hear you, Mr. Birmingham.
We'll do some poking around.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.941
We're gonna have
to take that camera.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.811
Falls under evidence
of the investigation
for Arbogast's murder.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.714
How quickly
can you gentlemen
act on this?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.049
As fast as we can, Mr. Blunt.
We got to get warrants.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.553
We got to get breakfast.
We got all sorts of Kafkaesque
bullshit to go through.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.955
Mm, justice moves
slow, Walter.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.693
People are confused
by right and wrong, hmm?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.595
Come on,
I'll walk you boys
out to your car.

07:07.695 --> 07:11.198
You got work to do.
Or you can come
by the house.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.767
I got some frozen
Argentinian steaks

07:13.867 --> 07:15.736
your wives will love
to cook up.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.338
All right, the vote
is tomorrow.

07:18.506 --> 07:22.109
We need the Rudolphs
discredited immediately.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.611
Ideas, please.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.345
Oh, okay, I--
I kind of have a--

07:25.513 --> 07:28.148
I have a really good idea
or a notion.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.018
It's a kernel.
Never mind. Sorry.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.320
Jim, what is it?

07:33.554 --> 07:35.422
Okay.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.826
We're gonna
have to talk to Shelly.

07:38.926 --> 07:42.062
So for the news of the day,
I'll cover the skirmish
in Kazakhstan,

07:42.162 --> 07:44.898
the flooding in Ohio,
and the abortion protest
in Charleston.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.034
Fantastic.
And then for
the Medicine Cabinet,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.436
I'm doing a special
on hysterectomies

07:49.537 --> 07:51.004
and their
psychological impact.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.806
I love it.
My mother had
a hysterectomy.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.608
Oh.

07:58.546 --> 08:02.983
Um, this is a great
intimacy and trust
exercise, Bob.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.218
Thanks.
I read about it
in Modern Love.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.988
Let me see yours.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.057
Uh, um, I'm not ready.
Can I see yours?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.792
Of course.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.263
Um...

08:16.363 --> 08:19.833
can we try another
intimacy exercise, Bob?
Sure.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.771
Rosalie?

08:23.871 --> 08:26.106
There's something
I have to tell you.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.441
I know.
Jim told me.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.043
Rosalie Two is pregnant.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.846
I thought I felt something
kick the other night.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.815
I told Jim
not to tell anyone.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.685
Everyone knows.
Mazel tov.

08:37.785 --> 08:41.589
But, Rosalie, I'm scared
to be a father.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.857
I'm not ready.
You are.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.595
You know how to listen.
You know how to be kind.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.097
You'll make
a beautiful father.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.032
But what about me and you?

08:52.132 --> 08:55.603
I-if I'm gonna be a dad,
I-I think I have
to quit swinging.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.772
That's fine.
I'll always be your friend.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.142
I love you
more than you know.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.915
Teddy!

09:08.015 --> 09:10.984
I thought I'd surprise
you, my love.
Oh!

09:11.084 --> 09:13.721
Martin, dear boy,
the girl at the front desk
told me the great news.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.957
Hey, maybe we're next.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.027
Mmm.
Oh, um, okay.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.200
Put your hands up
like this.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.903
Now place your
hands close to mine,
but we can't touch.

09:30.003 --> 09:33.106
Now let's make circles.
Mm-hmm.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.643
Try and breathe.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.646
And at the same time
maintain eye contact.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.113
Can I blink?
Yes, you can blink.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.482
It's-- look, it's--
it's not a staring game.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.652
Okay.
Okay? It's tantric.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.656
Let's see if we can come.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.957
You can come that easily?

09:50.057 --> 09:52.359
Oh, yeah, my G-spot
stays open 24/7.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.534
Oh, my God,
it's working.
I'm already wet.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.037
Shh! Shh!
I'm really close.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.806
Okay, sorry.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.741
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes!

10:07.841 --> 10:09.977
Yeah, baby.
Yes! Yes!

10:10.077 --> 10:12.445
Oh, my God!
Yes! Yes!

10:12.680 --> 10:15.615
Yes! Yes!

10:15.716 --> 10:18.285
What the hell is that?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.654
I missed my orgasm.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.656
I'm never gonna
get that back.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.057
Yes, you will, baby.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.700
Hi. Oh, shit.
What's your name, Kelly?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.968
Teddy, no.
It's Shelly.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.171
What is it, Shelly?
Were we too loud?

10:38.271 --> 10:39.940
Way too loud.
We're trying
to work in here.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.209
Bullshit.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.112
So annoying.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.148
Walter never complained
about my screams.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.718
You know what?
I think I'm ready
to go again.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.119
- Ah!
- All that fly-fishing

10:52.219 --> 10:54.154
has been good for
my circulation.

10:54.254 --> 10:58.191
Oh, Teddy,
I've missed you.
I've missed you, baby.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.260
Rosalie-- oh.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.730
Uh, Teddy,
you're back from
your fishing trip.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.998
Is he ever.
Hi, Walter.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.434
Great.
Uh, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.070
Uh, Rosalie,
there's something
I need to run past you.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.939
Can you give me
a minute, Walter?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.874
Ye-- yes,
o-of course.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.846
Shelly, Rosalie, I think
you're gonna love this.

11:18.946 --> 11:22.115
We found a loophole.
It's simple.

11:22.215 --> 11:26.153
It's beautiful.
It's perfect. It's--

11:26.253 --> 11:28.956
Jim, get to the point.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.124
Okay, ahem,
here's the point.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.361
Walter is suspended
from being the anchor,

11:34.461 --> 11:39.900
but they don't say
anything about him being
a guest on Blunt Talk.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.635
So Shelly can interview
Walter and he can get out

11:42.770 --> 11:44.972
his fantastic message
on Proposition 68.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.507
What do you think, Rosalie?
I like it.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.176
So do I.
It's ballsy.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.847
Harry?
Sorry, sir.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.583
W-we've been up
for 24 hours.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.218
Can I go and lie down?

11:58.318 --> 12:00.620
Otherwise I think
I might go mad.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.990
Yes, of course.
Thank you, sir.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.128
You can have a nap
on my couch if you like.
It's very comfortable.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.030
Thank you.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.201
Huh. So here's
the problem.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.636
Bob is not gonna like
this loophole idea

12:16.804 --> 12:19.506
and I don't want it
to endanger your
position, Shelly.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.274
I think I can get Bob
to say yes.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.912
I have a feeling
you can get Bob to say
a lot of things.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.713
What does that mean?

12:26.814 --> 12:29.216
You know what that means.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.352
Okay, listen, I don't like
keeping secrets from you guys.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.989
Bob and I have
become lovers. He's leaving
his boyfriend for me.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.458
Oh, my God,
that's sexual harassment.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.628
No, not if I like it.
I like it.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.496
I like it a lot.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.034
So after I do the news
of the day,

12:47.134 --> 12:49.036
I'll announce
a special broadcast.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.738
An exclusive interview
with Walter Blunt.

12:51.839 --> 12:55.375
And then Walter will
come out, but it'll be
right before the commercial.

12:55.475 --> 12:59.679
And he'll kiss me on
the cheek and everyone will
be freaking out to see him.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.949
And then I'll say
super sexy,

13:02.049 --> 13:05.718
"Back after this
with Walter Blunt."

13:05.853 --> 13:08.255
This way, the Internet
can get cooking.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.859
And by the time we're back,
everyone will be watching.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.894
This is about water, Bob.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.997
It is the most important
issue of the 21st century.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.400
Yeah, but it's also
really sexy.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.036
So this is what
Shelly wants?

13:23.136 --> 13:26.373
It is, Bob.
This is what Shelly wants.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.242
Okay.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.744
Well, Bob wants
what Shelly wants.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.981
And Shelly wants
what Bob wants.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.149
So let's do what we want.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.285
And if Bronson
gives me any pushback,

13:38.385 --> 13:41.121
I will tell him
to go fuck himself.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.933
Mr. Bronson.
I thought you
were in New York.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.501
I just flew in
this morning.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.337
This is my very good friend
Margaret Rudolph.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.340
Pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.576
Arthur's been telling me
how good you are at your job.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.378
Who invited Sonny and Cher?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.314
They're my security
from New York.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.918
We were told that Walter
is on the premises

14:10.984 --> 14:12.920
and I'd like him removed.
Why?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.155
Margaret has been
telling me some disturbing
things about him.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.758
His libelous accusations,
his cross-dressing,

14:18.926 --> 14:20.760
his bad dating etiquette.

14:20.928 --> 14:24.297
He's not a well person.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.544
Water.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.080
I need water.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.951
I need water.
I'm so thirsty.

14:44.051 --> 14:47.787
Don't worry,
we'll find you
water, Harriet.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.457
I promise.
Very soon now.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.727
Harry?
Water.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.063
Harry.
Water.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.131
Harry,
are you all right?
Wa--

14:58.231 --> 15:00.200
You were calling
out my name.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.070
No, I was crying
water, water.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.105
Walter.
No, water.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.839
Walter.
Water.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.808
Walter.
No, water.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.844
Walter.
No, sir, water.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.982
Sir, I was in the desert

15:15.048 --> 15:17.184
on a camel as Harriet.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.852
Harriet?
Your female persona
from the party?

15:19.987 --> 15:22.022
She was so much fun.
I loved her.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.691
Here he is.
Mr. Blunt.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.360
We're here to escort you
out of the building
immediately.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.998
On whose orders?
Mr. Bronson's.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.601
Good-bye, everyone.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.836
Baby, I'm sorry.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.306
Walter, Walter,
I'm sorry.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.375
Bronson flew
in from New York
and ambushed me.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.577
What happened
to telling him
to go fuck himself?

15:44.677 --> 15:48.848
I lost my nerve.
But I really wanted
to do this interview.

15:49.016 --> 15:52.019
Well, maybe we still can.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.221
But I'll need
the Jaguar.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.428
This is very
exciting, Walter.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.464
Yes, we're taking a big risk,
but Bob is onboard.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.500
You've really inspired
him, Shelly.
Thank you, Walter.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.203
So, Rosalie, Celia,
and Martin, you stay
with Shelly.

16:10.303 --> 16:14.174
Jim, procure a news van.
Do you have a commercial
driver's license?

16:14.274 --> 16:16.509
No.
It doesn't matter.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.211
Harry will text you
the coordinates.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.147
Copy that, Jim?
Yes, sir.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.349
Oh, and, Martin,
congratulations
on the baby.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.652
- I meant to say so earlier.
- Yeah, well done, Martin.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.154
Uh, thank you.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.556
You told everyone?
Yeah.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.659
Celia, are they in place?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.527
Uh, we need approximately
six more minutes.

16:34.627 --> 16:39.066
Oh. Shelly, we're opening
with the regular A block,

16:39.132 --> 16:42.369
then cutting early
to a commercial.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.571
Three, two...

16:48.308 --> 16:51.211
Jim, let's set up here.
This is the best frame.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.381
Okay,
we're live in 90 seconds.
Yeah, copy that, Celia.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.552
Harry!
Well, I don't want you
to burn, Major.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.189
Honestly, I don't even
know why we're out here
with your fair skin.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.691
Because this is
the perfect backdrop.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.627
I came fishing
here with Teddy once
and look at it now.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.130
Okay, Harry, I need you
to do the cards, okay?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.931
You got to be
the teleprompter, okay?

17:12.099 --> 17:14.101
I think I'll manage.
30 seconds.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.570
Okay, I'm sending
the uplink now, Celia.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.639
Do you have picture?
Yes, we have it.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.641
20 seconds now.
The break's almost over.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.244
Oh, I'm so excited.
Do I have time to use
the bathroom?

17:24.344 --> 17:27.114
No, hold it.
Shelly, we have Walter.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.316
Go with the prepared
questions.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.218
In five, four...

17:31.318 --> 17:34.954
Let's do this shit.
...three, two, one.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.357
Welcome back to Blunt Talk.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.393
Tonight we have something
really exciting for you,

17:40.493 --> 17:43.530
a very special guest--
Walter Blunt.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.865
Hello, Walter.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.201
Hello, Shelly.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.304
Walter, in the last week,

17:51.404 --> 17:53.173
you were framed for murder...

17:53.273 --> 17:56.576
Fucking hell.
Did you know about this?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.945
Yes.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.148
You moron.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.450
You don't realize
how much you cost me.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.153
So my first question is
where are you?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.721
Mars?
It looks awfully dry.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.526
Where-- where are you?
I'm here at Lake Castaic,

18:13.626 --> 18:15.462
40 miles north
of Los Angeles.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.665
Once a popular
and vibrant destination,

18:18.765 --> 18:20.567
the water level
of this lake

18:20.667 --> 18:24.404
has dropped over 100 feet
in the last few years.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.774
And tragically
this is happening
all over the state.

18:27.874 --> 18:31.278
We've all been hearing
so much about this drought
in California,

18:31.378 --> 18:32.679
but what can we actually do?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.547
Fucking shit!

18:34.647 --> 18:37.717
Bob says we should
lock all the doors
of the control room.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.388
Walter, your delay
in answering seems
overly long.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.390
I mean, there-- there's
always a-- a weird delay,

18:43.490 --> 18:45.325
but this seems
very pronounced.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.227
Yeah, Jim,
wh-what's happening
with the delay?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.795
C-Celia, I'm doing
the best I can.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.298
I'm looking at the manual.
I'm on page 22.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.734
What's that, Shelly?
I said is there anything

18:54.834 --> 18:56.436
we can do
about the drought?

18:56.536 --> 18:59.306
Yes, Shelly.
My fellow Angelinos,

18:59.406 --> 19:03.543
we must pass
Proposition 68 tomorrow

19:03.643 --> 19:07.314
and avail ourselves
of the future--
recycled water.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.517
Rudolph Global,
a water conglomerate,

19:10.617 --> 19:12.519
has tried to block
this measure for years

19:12.619 --> 19:16.223
in order to strengthen
their monopoly of our
water supply.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.125
They've used blackmail
and propaganda

19:19.226 --> 19:22.229
and have gone so far
as to murder

19:22.262 --> 19:25.798
and assault journalists
from The Guardian who
were on to them.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.812
Open the door.
Cut the broadcast.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.617
Point their finger
at me, huh?

19:44.717 --> 19:47.086
I'll give you more
than a mere middle finger,

19:47.320 --> 19:49.322
you mother...

19:49.422 --> 19:52.892
Miss Tinkle, I would like
you to go to commercial.

19:52.992 --> 19:56.629
Walter, things
are getting hairy here.
Get her off the air.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.365
I'm sorry,
what did you say, Shelly?

19:58.465 --> 20:00.267
But please keep talking
about the drought

20:00.333 --> 20:02.902
and Rudolph Global's
monopoly on our water supply.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.905
It's-- n-no!
Get your mitts off me.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.907
Help!
I believe in you, Walter.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.442
Let's do our thing!

20:09.542 --> 20:11.378
You, get up there
and tell the audience

20:11.478 --> 20:13.112
we'll be back
after a commercial.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.514
What? Oh, I'm only the--

20:14.614 --> 20:16.749
Get up there!
Okay.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.556
Five, four, three...
Oh, fucking hell.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.560
Who's counting?
Shut it down.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.830
Bronson's shutting
us down, Jim.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.765
Tell Walter to go
to his closing statement.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.034
Okay, Harry,
go to the last card.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.936
What?
The last card.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.345
Start reading,
Major.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.881
Unrest around the world
from Syria to North Korea

20:48.981 --> 20:52.919
can be linked
to drought and the famine
that comes in its wake.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.154
All right, get on the phone

20:55.254 --> 20:57.624
and I want you to cut
the power supply to this
floor right now.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.593
Yes, sir.
We are not
without power.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.195
There is the power
of our voice.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.565
The power of our vote.

21:05.665 --> 21:09.336
Rudolph Global
is a murderous corporation

21:09.436 --> 21:12.439
that wants to steal
your power here in LA,

21:12.539 --> 21:14.173
but we cannot let them.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.776
Pass Proposition 68,

21:16.876 --> 21:19.446
conserve water,
recycle water.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.348
If we can change
the way we think,

21:21.448 --> 21:23.416
we can change
the way we live.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.485
Whoo, yeah!

21:25.585 --> 21:27.454
Whoo, I love your dad.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.955
He hijacked
his own broadcast.

21:29.055 --> 21:32.258
He didn't even need me.
I love his dad. Yeah!

21:32.359 --> 21:34.961
This is Walter Blunt
right here--

21:35.061 --> 21:37.964
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh!

21:40.933 --> 21:43.936
Margaret Rudolph,
who allegedly arranged
moblike hits

21:44.036 --> 21:47.374
to protect her family business
and its far-reaching
water concerns,

21:47.440 --> 21:49.976
is being brought in
right now by the LAPD.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.979
Ms. Rudolph.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.914
Ms. Rudolph.
Ms. Rudolph.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.618
How do you feel
about the passing
of Proposition 68?

21:58.718 --> 22:01.688
Why'd you do it,
Ms. Rudolph?

22:01.788 --> 22:04.391
I did it for Los Angeles.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.893
Sounds like
a confession to me.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.428
You heard it here first.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.929
I'll send it back
to you, Walter.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.232
- This is Shelly Tinkle...
- Doing her thing.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.803
Thank you, Shelly.
After the break,
we'll have more

22:16.903 --> 22:19.406
on this tangled web
of corruption

22:19.472 --> 22:23.410
which has reached
all the way here to UBS.

22:23.476 --> 22:26.879
CEO Arthur Bronson
has been forced to resign

22:26.979 --> 22:30.950
in the wake of revelations
of improper business affairs

22:31.050 --> 22:34.253
with Rudolph Global.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.723
We'll be back
after this.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.826
To all my friends,
cheers.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.628
Cheers. Cheers.
To friends.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.262
Mr. Blunt,
you're up.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.633
What?
Oh, Lord.

22:46.733 --> 22:50.470
Which one of you
put my name down?
Yeah.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.939
Don't worry, Walter.
You know this song.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.343
Oh, you're in luck.
I do know this song.

22:57.444 --> 23:00.713
Well, this is
for the woman

23:00.813 --> 23:03.182
who broke my heart
30 years ago.

23:03.282 --> 23:06.318
It was the best thing
she could ever have done

23:06.453 --> 23:10.657
because otherwise
I would never have
met all of you.
