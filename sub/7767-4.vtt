00:14.620 --> 00:16.020
Received.

00:19.780 --> 00:22.050
DI Thursday and DS Strange are en route.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.500
Received.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.330
The cortege is pulling up
outside the chapel. Over.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.250
Received. Roger and out.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.500
Eyes down for a full house.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.930
They are about to enter the chapel. Over.

01:16.260 --> 01:19.420
Bit of discretion, Charlie. This
isn't the Eights Week dinner dance.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.860
Good turnout.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.570
The Lord is my shepherd.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.580
Two and three. 23.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.130
Gandhi's breakfast.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.140
Ate nothing.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.020
80.

02:03.340 --> 02:07.340
Prepare the payroll for Clissold Fashions.
- At once, sir.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.890
Where do you think you're going?
- It's a free country.

02:16.940 --> 02:18.480
You people.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.260
Have some respect.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.930
You have four hours.

02:28.980 --> 02:30.980
Turn your papers over.

02:33.140 --> 02:34.740
And begin.

02:41.340 --> 02:44.420
Five and two.
- Danny La Rue.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.940
52.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.860
Christmas cake.

02:57.580 --> 02:59.580
Good morning, sir.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.730
The payroll for Clissold fashion, sir.

03:37.780 --> 03:40.900
Thank you, Gidderton. Just leave
it on the desk, would you?

03:49.220 --> 03:52.900
Ah! The gang's all here,
then. Oxford's finest.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.860
Tommy Thompson.

03:55.940 --> 03:58.890
Bernie Waters.
- Who's the long streak with the blonde?

03:58.940 --> 04:02.820
Peter Matthews Senior. The house-trained
half of the Matthews brothers.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.060
The Breakers Yard Matthews
brothers? Out Abingdon way?

04:06.140 --> 04:08.610
"Scrap Metal Dealers of Repute."

04:09.140 --> 04:12.130
The one on the right with the
dark glasses, that's Cole.

04:12.180 --> 04:14.140
The older brother.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.740
Ah, they're all villains,
the whole Matthews family.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.250
Miss Frazil.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.300
Friends or family?

04:25.300 --> 04:28.100
The King is dead. Long live the King.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.940
Harry Rose was a lot of things,
but royalty wasn't one of them.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.770
Nature abhors a vacuum.

04:35.980 --> 04:38.050
...have anything to say to you.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.340
Oi! What are you doing?

04:50.860 --> 04:54.660
Afternoon, Mr Clissold. Late
today. I thought you'd forgotten us.

05:06.660 --> 05:09.860
It's a lunch hour, Miss Thursday.
- Sorry, Mr Fordyce, I'll make it up.

05:09.940 --> 05:13.820
Indeed you will, Miss Thursday.
This is a bank, not a social club.

05:26.340 --> 05:30.620
Miss Frazil's got a point. With Harry Rose gone,
the jockeying for top-dog could get nasty.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.690
Hello, matey. Back already?

05:32.740 --> 05:36.980
Finished early. Pretty straight-forward, isn't it?
- You checked your answers?

05:37.060 --> 05:39.900
Twice.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.780
How'd it go?
- Ah.

05:45.860 --> 05:49.980
You know what they say about funerals.
Always someone catches his death.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.500
Morse.

05:59.140 --> 06:01.740
How old was Mr Grissold?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.820
50s.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.730
Gentlemen.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.370
Cedric Clissold.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.290
Late of Clissold Fashions.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.130
There were two to the chest.

06:16.180 --> 06:20.860
Shots heard about an hour ago... which would
appear to give a fairly reliable time of death.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.940
Be able to give you the calibre
once I've had a root about.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.170
Looks to be a wages snatch, sir.

06:31.220 --> 06:34.900
L2.000. according to Mrs Abbott.
She's come out from the factory.

06:34.980 --> 06:38.220
Mr Clissold always collected
the payroll on a Wednesday.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.570
From where?
- Wessex on Cross Street.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.610
Joan's branch, isn't it?

06:42.660 --> 06:45.250
Witnesses?
- One of the neighbours heard a shot.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.970
Took it for a car backfiring.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.810
Next of kin?
- He was widowed.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.450
No other family to speak of.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.600
Keep on with the door-to-door.
- Yes, sir.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.570
Well, that didn't take long.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.450
Harry Rose barely cold.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.340
Right, matey. We'll take
the bank. You tidy up here.

07:04.220 --> 07:09.020
A formal statement from Mrs Abbott. Give the
car a quick go, once we've got his body out.

07:16.260 --> 07:21.020
It's just awful. Mr Clissold was a
valued customer of long-standing.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.740
He seemed his usual self, did
he? Nothing out of the ordinary?

07:24.820 --> 07:29.780
No. Not at all. It was a perfectly
straightforward transaction, the same as always.

07:29.860 --> 07:31.490
How was his business?

07:31.540 --> 07:34.540
He was facing stiff competition
from Far East imports

07:34.620 --> 07:37.530
and recently had to lay off
a quarter of his workers.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.970
Money troubles?

07:39.020 --> 07:41.370
You didn't happen to
notice anyone outside?

07:41.420 --> 07:44.130
Odds are the robbers would've
had their eye on him.

07:44.180 --> 07:46.250
I didn't really notice.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.850
I was late back from lunch.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.100
No.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.490
Tell a lie. There was
a car across the road.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.780
Navy.

07:54.860 --> 07:57.130
Well, what about the driver?

07:57.940 --> 07:59.680
Hm... No. Sorry.

08:04.180 --> 08:05.650
Anything more from Mrs Abbott?

08:05.700 --> 08:09.100
She was asking after an order book,
some sort of carbon pad he used for work.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.770
Forensics didn't pick up
anything like that, did they?

08:11.820 --> 08:13.760
Not so far as I know.

08:22.180 --> 08:23.720
Mucky Beth.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.850
Moaning Becomes Electra.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.290
Good grief!

08:28.340 --> 08:30.010
Hedda Gobbler.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.970
Only In Oxford.
- Mm.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.090
We're shut.
- Yeah. Looks it.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.480
You got an afternoon licence?

08:46.900 --> 08:49.370
This is a private members' club.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.980
A nice bit of work today.
- Oh, yeah. What's that, then?

08:54.060 --> 08:56.600
A wages snatch in Holywell Street.

08:57.660 --> 09:01.620
We're all right for a comic. Ta.
Always looking for strippers, though.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.450
What do you reckon, Pete?

09:03.500 --> 09:06.340
Fred Thursday in G-string and pasties?

09:09.140 --> 09:12.050
Don't talk with your mouth full,
Cole. It makes you look simple.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.770
Where were you, then, this afternoon?

09:15.300 --> 09:17.930
You know where we were. Harry Rose's wake.

09:17.980 --> 09:19.660
And later?

09:20.740 --> 09:23.540
I took a bath.
- Anyone confirm that?

09:23.860 --> 09:25.620
Yeah. Me.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.370
And where were you? At the plug end?

09:31.820 --> 09:33.820
Come on!
- Drop it.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.600
Drop it!

09:35.660 --> 09:39.740
Drop it, you snide cow-son!

09:39.820 --> 09:41.180
Drop it!

09:42.260 --> 09:45.540
Or it'll be your neck and
Cole's parole, right there.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.900
Any ideas you've got about taking
over Harry Rose's pitch, think again.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.090
You're on notice.

10:02.140 --> 10:04.740
What? Coming for us, are you, Fred?

10:05.220 --> 10:08.420
Then you'd better come carrying.
- Count on...

10:13.060 --> 10:15.340
Sounds nasty.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.420
Yeah, I heard you got plugged.
A lung shot, wasn't it?

10:21.300 --> 10:23.840
You want to cut down on the pipe.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.420
Two bullets, 0.38 calibre.

10:41.220 --> 10:43.210
Same as you've got rattling around.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.330
Thanks for the reminder.

10:45.780 --> 10:49.770
What have I missed?
- Sunday Night at the London Palladium!

10:49.820 --> 10:51.210
Anything from his work?

10:51.260 --> 10:54.420
Erm... seems to have been pretty well
liked, so far as I could make out.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.620
Nobody could tell me about his personal life.
- A private sort?

10:57.700 --> 11:02.180
Secretive was the word used, by more than
one of his colleagues. Obsessively so.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.850
Maybe not without cause.

11:03.900 --> 11:07.380
There was a box in the boot of
his car filled with... stag films.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.130
Nature studies?

11:09.860 --> 11:11.650
Not an antler in sight, I'm afraid.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.970
Well...

11:13.020 --> 11:15.290
I'll leave you to your... whatever it is.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.330
The doctor will fill you in on the rest.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.490
Sergeant.

11:18.540 --> 11:22.260
Oh, and I shan't need you in the
morning. I'll make my own way in.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.690
What did I miss?

11:30.740 --> 11:32.140
Not much.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.810
In general good health
for a man of his age.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.420
No disease.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.940
You didn't happen to open his
jacket to get to his chest, did you?

11:40.020 --> 11:41.810
No. It was like that when I arrived.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.900
The robber takes L2.000. but then
hangs about to pinch his wallet?

11:45.980 --> 11:49.460
Actually, the wallet was in the
back pocket of his trousers.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.450
On the side, with the rest
of his personal effects.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.700
Oh.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.860
There wasn't a pad with this lot,
was there? His work were asking.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.740
What came in is what's there. As always.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.770
What about his final meal?
- A bit gastric for you, isn't it?

12:05.820 --> 12:09.060
Wouldn't happen to be chicken meat
and sweetcorn soup, by any chance?

12:09.140 --> 12:11.100
Saveloy and chips.

12:11.180 --> 12:12.650
You're sure?

12:12.700 --> 12:15.020
Alimentary, my dear Morse.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.370
Why?
- He's got a Chinese take-away menu here.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.130
Bamboo House on the Marston Road.

12:19.180 --> 12:20.570
Oh, that closed.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.010
Years ago.

12:22.060 --> 12:25.500
Now... what's this about
a sergeant's exam?

12:25.580 --> 12:27.940
Pastures new?
- How's that?

12:28.020 --> 12:31.980
There's not going to be room for
two sergeants at Cowley, is there?

13:23.440 --> 13:25.240
A programme, sir?

13:29.160 --> 13:31.160
Poor Mr Clissold.

13:32.120 --> 13:35.420
I can't believe it. I only
saw him this afternoon.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.280
You didn't notice anyone out of the
ordinary hanging round the street?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.360
I'll get it.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.070
I thought you'd already made a statement.
- I have.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.550
To Jim Strange.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.510
Well, then, there's no need
to go on about it at home.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.600
Especially on Sam's last night.
- People remember things.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.640
For me, is it?
- No. It's for Joanie.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.990
Who for Joan?
- Some fella.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.150
He have a name?
- I didn't ask.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.540
Call yourself a copper's son?

14:05.560 --> 14:06.630
Hello.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.680
Hello, blue eyes. When
can I see you again?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.400
d Classical

14:48.760 --> 14:50.640
Morse?

14:51.400 --> 14:53.990
Oh, Dr Lorimer.
- I thought it was you.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.320
Well, this is a surprise, I must say.
I never thought to see you again.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.390
Are you in Oxford?
- For a few years now.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.150
I'm a policeman at Cowley.
A detective constable.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.400
Although, I sat my
sergeant's exam this morning.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.120
Flying colours await, I'm
sure. You were a good student.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.200
You mean, I was the only one who didn't mind
running down the High to put a bet on for you.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.040
What did you have me get you?
20 Guards, a quarter of blended

15:17.120 --> 15:20.030
and five bob on anything
offering threes or better?

15:20.080 --> 15:22.480
"All my sins remembered."

15:23.640 --> 15:27.320
Well, "we have heard the chimes at midnight".
- Once or twice, yes.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.590
Well, er... it was good to see you.
- And you.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.380
Enjoy the second half.
- Thank you.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.470
Come and see me.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.510
Yes, erm, well, I'll telephone.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.870
Tomorrow?

15:37.920 --> 15:39.710
Tomorrow?
- Ten o'clock?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.700
You remember the way?

15:41.760 --> 15:44.760
Er... yes.
- Tomorrow, then.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.980
I made you a round for the
coach. Cheese and pickle.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.040
Come here, then.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.080
Cheer-oh, Fatty.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.760
Jump to it.

16:26.280 --> 16:30.640
Don't cheek the RSM or you'll find yourself in
the Glasshouse quicker than you can say knife.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.350
I won't.
- And see you write your mother. I mean it.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.400
A letter a week at least. Let
her know how you're getting on.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.950
Right, then.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.200
Here.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.190
There's... er... just...

16:45.760 --> 16:48.300
It's just a few bob for the NAAFI.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.680
Best find your seat.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.840
Watch that cough. Dad...

16:53.920 --> 16:56.910
I'm fine. A creaking
gate hangs the longest.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.750
'No. 3, final call for the... '

16:58.800 --> 17:00.200
Right.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.540
On you get.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.000
Sam!

17:08.160 --> 17:10.500
Don't volunteer for anything.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.710
Thought I said I'd make
my own way in today.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.160
I forgot.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.830
Come on, Larry. Shake a leg.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.680
Stay in the car.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.190
Any tips this morning, Bernie?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.830
Oh, it's you, Mr Thursday.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.440
Well, you'd do worse than Make
Mine Mink, the 2:30 at Newmarket.

18:28.520 --> 18:33.760
Oh, I was hoping for something closer to home,
you know, this wages snatch on Holywell Street.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.550
Clissold Fashions. Who's
the favourite on that?

18:36.600 --> 18:38.590
Oh! I... I can't, Mr Thursday.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.230
Surprise yourself.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.070
Stick or twist?
- Stick or...?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.750
Aargh! All right, all right.

18:43.800 --> 18:48.800
All right. Cole and Peter Matthews have been
planning something big. But that is all I know.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.280
Uhh!

18:56.280 --> 18:58.080
There.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.880
Wasn't too hard, was it?
- I don't want no come-backs.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.280
You know what Cole's like.
- Between you and me.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.440
Thanks for the steer, Bernie.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.950
Funny, that never came
up in the sergeant's exam.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.190
What didn't?

19:20.240 --> 19:23.150
Knocking informants around.
- Not everything's in Fitton's.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.910
Is that how we do things now?
- I told you to wait in the car.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.190
The end justifies the means?

19:27.240 --> 19:30.070
Bastards like that, yes. This
isn't tea on the Master's lawn.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.470
Clissold's the first move in a turf war.
- Says who?

19:32.520 --> 19:36.600
Me. Got the Matthews brothers written all over
it. We need to put it down and put it down hard.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.240
I need a bagman I can stand on, someone
who's not afraid to get their hands dirty.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.320
So, any time it gets
too salty, you just say.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.000
Here.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.750
You said you'd make your own way in.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.560
Ah, good.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.100
Come round.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.430
Found me all right, then?

20:27.480 --> 20:29.990
Well, the gillyflowers.
- Ah, yes. Always.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.510
Erm, sherry?

20:31.560 --> 20:33.070
Mm, thank you.

20:33.120 --> 20:37.000
They say you know you're getting older
when policemen start to look younger,

20:37.080 --> 20:39.110
but I think, in my case, it's undergrads.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.840
Coming through the quad there, it's
hard to believe I was ever here at all.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.350
It was funny, seeing
you through the window,

20:45.400 --> 20:48.840
you had that same look on your
face the first time I ever saw you.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.510
What look's that?
- Oh...

20:50.560 --> 20:51.750
Nervous.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.910
Shy.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.080
Er... Hopeful.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.440
Yes, I suppose I was. All of those things.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.190
Frightened, mostly,
that's my abiding memory.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.510
Of what?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.150
Of being found out.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.590
Found wanting.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.760
Not for a moment. A Congratulatory
First was yours for the asking.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.380
If I'd known one had but to ask...

21:12.640 --> 21:14.710
And you're keeping well?
- Oh, yes.

21:14.760 --> 21:18.920
Yes, er, I'm chair on the
Greats Examination Board now,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.550
but, er... one year rolls into the next.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.550
The last I heard, you were
getting married. Is that right?

21:24.600 --> 21:26.040
Yes. Yes.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.520
And you?

21:27.600 --> 21:29.190
Did you ever...?
- Oh, no.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.710
No, I've work.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.240
And erm...

21:33.320 --> 21:35.280
Well, work, mostly.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.300
Rewarding, I expect.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.160
It has its moments.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.550
Ah, Thursday.
- A wages snatch, sir.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.960
The word is the Matthews brothers have
been planning something big... What's this?

21:47.040 --> 21:51.320
Thursday, this is Detective Superintendent
Crowthorn and Detective Sergeant Craig.

21:51.400 --> 21:55.100
From the Complaints Bureau.
They'd like to talk to you.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.150
Now we're in touch again, you
must dine in, high table.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.590
I'd like that.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.910
You ever think of picking up your degree?

22:02.960 --> 22:08.120
Oh, no. Like innocence and hope for mankind,
I number it now amongst the lost things.

22:08.200 --> 22:13.080
Pity. I was very sorry to see you go. Been a
fellow by now, if you'd stayed the course.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.440
I really... I must be off.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.830
Is there something you
wanted to talk to me about?

22:19.880 --> 22:23.680
You didn't invite me back just
to kick through the leaves.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.880
It's Nina. My wife.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.760
I'm... concerned... for her safety.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.800
She's... That is, we are living
apart, have been for some time.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.980
I'm here and she's got
the house in Summertown.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.030
Erm, what do you expect
me to do with this?

22:42.080 --> 22:45.600
Just hear me out. She's
become involved with this...

22:45.680 --> 22:46.920
type.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.760
Paul Marlock.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.720
He works at The Royal... Some
bingo hall in Cobb Street, anyway.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.790
Now she wants a divorce.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.000
Right.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.240
But you've no real grounds
to think she's in any danger?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.150
I thought perhaps you...

23:07.200 --> 23:09.390
might be able to look into it,

23:09.440 --> 23:11.400
into this Marlock.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.880
You have the means, presumably.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.960
Ah.

23:16.040 --> 23:20.240
I'm a police officer, not
a private enquiry agent.

23:22.280 --> 23:25.070
If you want my advice, you'd... let it go.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.080
Let it go?

23:27.160 --> 23:28.500
Christ.

23:33.240 --> 23:38.400
You know, I can still recall your exact
words, the first time you saw her.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.020
I can see it now. As clear as day.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.960
You came in, sat down
just there and said...

23:48.320 --> 23:51.260
"I've just seen an angel crossing Carfax."

23:51.800 --> 23:55.880
"This brown-eyed blonde, with
the reddest lips you ever saw."

23:58.560 --> 24:00.150
That last term,

24:00.200 --> 24:02.200
you were a thing...

24:03.520 --> 24:05.590
...altogether pitiable.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.620
Well, there's no fool
like an old fool, I know.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.240
Good afternoon.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.910
Hello. I didn't think you were coming.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.190
How's that?
- You're not Mr Kitteridge?

24:51.240 --> 24:53.400
The estate agent?

24:53.480 --> 24:56.000
No. No, I'm here to view.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.190
You?

24:57.240 --> 25:01.200
They gave me the key at the office, said
to drop it back after I'd had a look around.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.880
What time are you?
- Two-thirty.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.960
Me, too. They really are the end.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.640
They've obviously double-booked us.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.230
Hey, we could see it together.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.670
All right.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.190
Morse. Miss...?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.510
Burton.

25:16.560 --> 25:17.750
Nina.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.470
Well, shall we?

25:25.080 --> 25:27.070
My boyfriend is meeting me.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.310
He should be here any minute.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.100
Well, then, you should be safe enough.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.070
Have you just moved to the area?
- I've been here a while.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.110
Yes, I've been here a while, too.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.260
I'm in a pokey little
basement flat right now.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.670
What brought you to Oxford?

25:50.720 --> 25:52.710
I just wanted to travel.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.000
Me and a girlfriend got as far
as Oxford. The money ran out.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.620
I got a job.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.150
Doing what?
- Just factory work.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.670
Machinist.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.710
Done all sorts since then.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.160
Waitress.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.440
I work in a florist's now.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.360
What about your boyfriend?
What does he do?

26:15.400 --> 26:17.390
You ask a lot of questions.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.430
Ah, I was in market research.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.040
Old habits.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.840
He's in the entertainment business.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.270
Well, that's what I tell people.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.200
He's a bingo caller.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.670
I wonder what's keeping him.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.760
Actually, he's not coming.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.560
No?

26:40.640 --> 26:42.840
No, I just said that to...

26:44.680 --> 26:46.640
Well...

26:46.720 --> 26:49.190
to make sure you were all right.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.760
I see.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.200
And am I?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.750
All right?

26:57.440 --> 26:59.360
I think so.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.710
Sorry.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.760
Silly, I suppose.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.920
No. No, not at all.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.680
He's already seen it.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.030
He wants to put an offer in.

27:12.040 --> 27:15.140
But I wanted to look it
over for myself first.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.150
And does it pass muster?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.280
I don't think so.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.520
You?

27:27.680 --> 27:29.280
No.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.160
I don't think it's for me.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.680
Better luck next time.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.350
Where have you been?

27:44.400 --> 27:46.110
In pursuit.
- Of what?

27:46.160 --> 27:48.360
An angel crossing Carfax.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.920
I think I'm meant to leave wages snatches
to the rough boys, these days, aren't I?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.760
Why? What's up?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.240
Complaints want to talk to you.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.480
Suspended?
- A couple of weeks' furlough.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.990
Just until it's cleared up.

28:06.040 --> 28:09.520
If Bernie Waters has made a
complaint, someone's put him up to it.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.030
He hasn't got the brains
to blow his own wig off.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.270
As may be, but Division takes
these things very seriously.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.420
No-one will question
your past service, but...

28:18.480 --> 28:20.870
There'll be no room in
Thames Valley for...

28:20.920 --> 28:22.720
out-dated methods.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.680
Paul Marlock.

28:42.400 --> 28:46.280
I spoke to the coroner's men.
That workbook or pad of Clissold's,

28:46.360 --> 28:49.840
it hadn't fallen out in the van,
in case you were still looking.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.110
I was.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.700
Thank you.
- Glad to be of use.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.240
Oh, er, Trewlove.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.780
Are you doing anything tonight after work?

29:01.800 --> 29:04.560
All the fours.
- Droopy drawers.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.520
Tickety-boo.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.440
62!

29:08.520 --> 29:12.040
Five and nine.
- The Brighton Line!

29:12.960 --> 29:14.950
Oh, that's me! House! Here!

29:15.000 --> 29:16.790
Ah, it appears we have a winner!

29:16.840 --> 29:19.150
Dolores, will you check the card, please?

29:19.200 --> 29:23.800
And while Dolores is doing that, we're just
going to take a short ten-minute interval.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.980
After which, we'll be
playing for Big Money.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.430
Hot in there.
- Oh, yeah.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.790
That's why I come out, to catch some air.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.590
You here with someone?
- Yes, the, er... bird.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.400
She's bingo mad.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.960
I was gonna say, you don't get
many blokes in here on their own.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.030
You been at it long?

29:56.080 --> 29:57.640
Six months.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.720
Money for old rope. And
the tarts, of course.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.350
Is that right?
- Yeah, I've got this one on the go at the minute.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.870
Legs up to here.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.510
And stacked, like...

30:07.560 --> 30:09.630
Pete Murray's turntable.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.310
So, what's your line, then? College?

30:14.000 --> 30:17.200
That's right.
- Thought so. You look the type.

30:20.440 --> 30:23.720
Just having a gasp, Tom.
- Yeah, well, that's not what you're paid for.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.800
Be lucky.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.240
Come on.
- Really?

30:44.320 --> 30:46.680
Mm-hm.
- Righto.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.430
We could go out for a drink after.

30:55.480 --> 30:59.440
What should I do with the winnings? I'd have
thought I'd have to turn them in for evidence.

30:59.520 --> 31:03.280
Ill-gotten gains in the line of duty.
- Oh, it wasn't in the line of duty.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.830
A private matter. Keep it.

31:04.880 --> 31:05.990
Really?

31:06.040 --> 31:09.120
I don't want to find myself
on the end of a disciplinary.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.240
Speaking of which, what is going on
upstairs, with Inspector Thursday?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.030
Why? What do you hear?

31:15.080 --> 31:17.670
That he leaned on someone
a little too heavily.

31:17.720 --> 31:21.160
At least, that's the word around the canteen.
- The canteen?

31:21.240 --> 31:25.320
I wouldn't trust the spotted dick in
that place, let alone anything else.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.080
Did you get anywhere with Marlock?
He looks a thorough scoundrel.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.720
He is, but irresistible to
the ladies, it would seem.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.800
I thought him eminently resistible.
- You're a police officer. You're immune.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.110
There is a woman under the uniform, Morse.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.280
Just not a stupid one.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.870
While you were talking to him,

31:48.920 --> 31:52.280
I affected an interest with
Dolores, who brought me my winnings.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.920
His telephone number.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
You'll be able to reverse-trace an
address for him, should you need it.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.590
Good heavens, Morse. Late for you.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.790
Evening, sir.
- Something I can help you with?

32:10.840 --> 32:13.560
Inspector Thursday, sir.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.240
Can they make it stick, Complaints?

32:19.120 --> 32:22.720
I suppose that very much depends on what
you said to the officers from Division.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.280
Yes. He has in you, I
think, a loyal colleague...

32:29.240 --> 32:31.310
...and a staunch friend.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.270
I've been wondering.

32:35.320 --> 32:40.160
This "something big" Bernie Waters said
that the Matthews brothers had been planning.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.910
What if it wasn't the wages snatch?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.950
Thank you, sir.
- Have you any reason to doubt it?

32:45.000 --> 32:50.760
Cole Matthews' previous has been
in the 10.000. 15.000. 20.000 range.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.470
Security vans. Post Offices.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.640
If they are looking to take Harry Rose's
crown, then knocking off Cedric Clissold

32:57.720 --> 33:01.040
for what amounts to beer money seems a
pretty poor way to stake their claim.

33:01.120 --> 33:05.640
You've no other cause to think Clissold's
death anything other than what first appears?

33:05.720 --> 33:09.720
These blue films I found in the boot of his
car. Now, if his death is connected to that,

33:09.800 --> 33:12.910
then the list of suspects
could be half of the city.

33:12.960 --> 33:17.160
Then whatever this "something big" is
the Matthews brothers have planned...

33:17.240 --> 33:18.980
Is yet to occur.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.880
Nice wheels, Ken.

34:23.600 --> 34:28.120
An unauthorised overdraft is a serious
matter, Mr Morse, as I'm sure you understand.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.400
Yes.

34:30.920 --> 34:36.080
Last month, you wrote a cheque
payable to a Mrs G Morse for L25,

34:36.159 --> 34:40.600
while you had insufficient funds in your
account against which to draw the sum.

34:40.679 --> 34:44.840
We've also had L15 to a Mr Robey,
turf accountant, of Lincoln.

34:45.920 --> 34:50.080
And the same to Mr Robey the month
before that and the month before that.

34:53.159 --> 34:57.360
Really, Mr Morse, the Wessex is not
here to underwrite a life of vice.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.280
No. Of course.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.230
Look, I was a young man
myself once, you know.

35:02.280 --> 35:07.120
I know what it's like. A fella must have the
latest this and that to impress the ladies.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.440
But such profligacy will, I'm
afraid, incur a financial penalty.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.080
Hello.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.830
Hello.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.070
I saw you down The Royal last night.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.020
What were you doing at the bingo?

35:30.120 --> 35:31.920
Well...

35:32.280 --> 35:33.830
Work.
- Oh.

35:33.880 --> 35:37.400
Look, I don't know the ins and outs and
it's probably not my place to say, but...

35:38.400 --> 35:40.740
...the caller, Paul Marlock...

35:41.480 --> 35:44.150
...I'd give him a wide berth, maybe.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.920
You're right. It's not your place to say.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.150
May I help... you?

36:04.200 --> 36:08.840
Well, actually, Mrs Lorimer, I'm hoping that
I can help you. Paul Marlock. Your boyfriend.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.880
He's a conman.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.920
You should drop him.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.340
Did Felix put you up to this?

36:16.400 --> 36:19.340
Well, you can tell him, better a conman...

36:20.560 --> 36:22.100
...than a...

36:22.880 --> 36:26.360
Than a...? Than a what?
- My God. You've no idea, have you?

36:26.440 --> 36:28.030
I think you should go.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.780
Do you want me to call the police?
- I am the police.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.310
Better a conman than a what?

36:37.160 --> 36:39.500
I think Felix killed someone.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.920
A man called Clissold.

36:47.220 --> 36:50.420
When I first come here, I
worked at Clissold Fashions.

36:51.260 --> 36:56.820
Clissold had me model the line for
buyers, just to make a bit of extra cash.

37:01.780 --> 37:07.060
One of them said he had a friend in the film
business, that he could get me a try-out.

37:09.420 --> 37:11.820
It sounded like fun. Only wh...

37:12.740 --> 37:14.330
...when I got there...

37:14.380 --> 37:17.180
They weren't making Gone With The Wind.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.490
It was just the once.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.850
And I told him I wouldn't do any more.

37:26.900 --> 37:31.980
I left Clissold's and put it out of my mind,
and got on with my life and I met Felix.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.640
Everything was wonderful.

37:37.980 --> 37:41.660
Then, last year, he went to a party for one
of his students who was getting married.

37:41.740 --> 37:44.340
Had a bit of a film show, did they?

37:48.460 --> 37:50.660
I begged him to let it go.

37:52.540 --> 37:55.660
But he was terrified one of
his colleagues might see it.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.650
He decided to...

37:59.700 --> 38:01.690
find out where it had come from.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.940
Which led him to Clissold.

38:05.660 --> 38:08.090
But what makes you think he
went so far as to kill him?

38:08.140 --> 38:10.810
Felix told me he threatened Clissold.

38:10.860 --> 38:13.530
That unless he destroyed the film...

38:14.420 --> 38:16.690
...and all the prints, that he'd be sorry.

38:16.740 --> 38:18.330
How did Clissold react?

38:18.380 --> 38:20.580
He told Felix to get lost.

38:21.100 --> 38:25.020
Or he'd put his name to a list
of customers he kept in a pad.

38:25.100 --> 38:27.770
The one he used for work, I suppose.

38:28.580 --> 38:31.860
I remember he was always very cagey
about it. Never let it out of his sight.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.810
We didn't find anything like that on him.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.380
Unless...

38:37.860 --> 38:41.220
Well, he had been to the bank
the morning he was killed.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.290
You think he might have left it there?

38:43.340 --> 38:44.730
At the bank?

38:44.780 --> 38:46.250
Would you recognise it?

38:46.300 --> 38:49.580
Of course. It's just a carbon pad,
pick 'em up at any stationer's.

38:53.340 --> 38:56.580
Thank you. For believing me.

38:57.580 --> 38:59.530
I'm not sure that I do, altogether.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.650
I'm not lying.
- I'm not saying that you are.

39:01.700 --> 39:06.140
You think what you think, but the Dr Lorimer
that I know wouldn't be capable of such a thing.

39:24.940 --> 39:27.780
Oh, I've looked into your Paul Marlock.

39:28.900 --> 39:29.970
Well?

39:30.020 --> 39:32.370
He's a fraudster, but there's
nothing in his history

39:32.420 --> 39:35.660
which would lead me to believe that
your wife is in any physical danger.

39:36.780 --> 39:39.330
Out of interest, where were
you Wednesday afternoon?

39:39.380 --> 39:42.580
Between two and three.
- I had a lecture. Why?

39:43.140 --> 39:46.010
It's not important. Just
something your wife said.

39:46.060 --> 39:48.000
Ah, you've seen Nina?

39:51.260 --> 39:53.220
Something, isn't she?

39:53.300 --> 39:54.570
Let it go.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.420
For your own good.

39:56.700 --> 39:59.010
That's rich, coming from you.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.050
Well, that's all I came to say.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.040
If you'll excuse me.

40:05.780 --> 40:08.170
...pursue it, if I were you. It might...

40:08.220 --> 40:10.930
My ears and whiskers! Is
that young Morse, I spy?

40:10.980 --> 40:12.780
Oh. Hello, Jerome.

40:13.740 --> 40:15.090
Oh, erm...

40:15.140 --> 40:18.420
Run along, now, Randall. I shall
be with you in two shakes.

40:20.420 --> 40:23.780
Alas, I fancy, a lover of
oysters. For all my blandishments.

40:23.860 --> 40:27.420
What are you doing cloister
loitering? Looking up old friends?

40:27.500 --> 40:29.180
Felix Lorimer.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.500
Oh.

40:30.580 --> 40:34.860
The face that lunched a thousand
shits. Present company, of course.

40:34.940 --> 40:38.260
Felix, these days, is chairman
of the Greats examiners.

40:38.340 --> 40:40.530
Oh, yes. I'd heard.
- What had you heard?

40:40.580 --> 40:44.540
That he hands out vivas like Dolly Mixtures?
- Is this college gossip?

40:44.620 --> 40:48.180
Or did he beat you to a place on the board?
- That's neither here nor there.

40:48.260 --> 40:49.850
It's about standards.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.370
Let me tell you.

40:51.420 --> 40:53.410
I had, of late, the great misfortune

40:53.460 --> 40:57.860
to tutor the stroke from the Oxford boat, last
year, and a greater dullard may you never meet,

40:57.940 --> 41:00.500
yet somehow... somehow...

41:00.580 --> 41:04.220
this bank manager's son, scarcely
able to construct a sentence,

41:04.300 --> 41:06.210
let alone a logical proposition,

41:06.260 --> 41:08.420
ended up with a first.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.460
Of course, I imply no impropriety.

41:11.540 --> 41:13.300
But what of you?

41:13.380 --> 41:16.090
Oh, nothing to report. I must be going.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.610
Where might I find you?

41:17.660 --> 41:19.370
I want to hear all your news.

41:19.420 --> 41:23.140
Cowley Road police station. I'm
a detective with the City Police.

41:32.180 --> 41:34.050
Look sharp, Joanie.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.600
Goodbye, Mr Mason.
- Thank you.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.490
Hello.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.810
Hello.
- How can I help you today, sir?

41:49.860 --> 41:53.660
Just a little cheque, if you
wouldn't mind. Just made out to cash.

42:05.140 --> 42:08.660
Just spoke to the old man on the phone. We
need a shufti of the surveillance footage.

42:08.740 --> 42:12.700
He wants us to see if we can get any more
ground covered before Kidlington takes over.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.730
Who's that?
- Kenny Stone.

42:17.780 --> 42:22.020
Car thief and sometimes stock car racer.
Fancies himself another Jim Clark.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.970
A get-away driver, perhaps, for Clissold.

42:26.140 --> 42:29.130
I know Bernie Walters, but who's that with him?
- Tommy Thompson.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.970
No. No. To the right of Thompson.
- Larry Nelson. Small fry.

42:32.020 --> 42:36.100
Runs around picking up crumbs after
Peter Matthews. That's Peter there.

42:36.180 --> 42:38.120
Peter's wife, Sheila.

42:38.940 --> 42:41.210
Peter's wife doesn't seem
too keen on the widow.

42:41.260 --> 42:43.930
That's cos Peter's knocking her off.

42:46.740 --> 42:50.700
Larry Nelson's very solicitous of the wife.
- Keeping in Peter's good books, in't he?

42:50.780 --> 42:52.250
He looks shifty to me.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.370
Well, Larry just does what he's told.

42:54.420 --> 42:55.620
Hm...

42:57.020 --> 42:59.560
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

43:06.860 --> 43:09.850
Cole and Peter about?
- They've gone to see their mother.

43:09.900 --> 43:13.580
She took poorly. I'm looking after
the place for a couple of hours.

43:13.660 --> 43:15.450
We're looking for Larry Nelson.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.090
Larry? I wouldn't know.

43:17.140 --> 43:21.260
Don't come that, Bernie. Larry breaks wind, you
know he's had one egg for breakfast or two.

43:21.340 --> 43:24.380
What's the story with Larry
and Peter Matthews' wife?

43:24.460 --> 43:26.450
Story?
- They seem very close.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.850
What do you mean?
- A time like this.

43:28.900 --> 43:32.820
Everything up in the air. A man might try and
break out on his own, wouldn't you think?

43:32.900 --> 43:34.210
I couldn't say.

43:34.260 --> 43:37.900
Plenty to say when it comes to putting
the black on Inspector Thursday, though.

43:37.980 --> 43:41.220
Yeah, I've got rights. Can't go round
knocking people about like that.

43:41.300 --> 43:43.100
Uhh!

43:43.660 --> 43:46.210
Your sort don't have rights, Bernie.
- That's enough.

43:46.260 --> 43:48.370
You come for one of ours,
I will skulldrag you!

43:48.420 --> 43:49.690
All right!

43:49.740 --> 43:53.040
If you see Larry, tell
him we're looking for him.

43:54.460 --> 43:58.740
Don't ever do that again. If I'm questioning
a suspect I expect you to back me.

43:58.820 --> 44:03.460
Questioning? If you want to take a leaf out of
Thursday's book, there's better places to start.

44:03.540 --> 44:07.540
Look, let's get one thing straight, matey.
You don't tell me, I tell you. All right?

44:07.620 --> 44:10.130
If the job calls for brains,
you'll be first in the queue.

44:10.180 --> 44:14.080
Something like this? Leave it
to those who've got the sand.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.700
Ugh.

44:29.140 --> 44:31.330
Morning, Mr Fordyce.
- Mr Gidderton.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.370
The weekend float's just pulled up.

44:33.420 --> 44:34.610
Very good.

44:34.660 --> 44:37.200
Tell them we'll open up the rear.

44:38.380 --> 44:40.250
Oh.
- Morning, Joanie.

44:40.300 --> 44:41.640
Morning.

44:43.300 --> 44:45.770
Good morning.
- Good morning.

44:51.820 --> 44:54.360
What if it wasn't a wages snatch?

44:55.140 --> 44:58.090
I've been talking to my old
mods tutor, Felix Lorimer.

44:58.140 --> 45:01.300
His wife's got involved with a
bingo caller from The Royal.

45:01.380 --> 45:03.490
Paul Marlock. A conman and a fraudster.

45:03.540 --> 45:07.660
The Royal's a front for the Matthews brothers.
If Marlock's caught up with that lot...

45:07.740 --> 45:09.970
Well, the point is, when
I warned her about him,

45:10.020 --> 45:13.860
she told me she suspected her husband of
killing Clissold. She's wrong. He didn't.

45:13.940 --> 45:16.770
How do you know?
- He was giving a lecture at the time.

45:16.820 --> 45:20.980
Those blue films I found in Clissold's boot,
it turns out Nina Lorimer had made one for him.

45:21.060 --> 45:25.100
She told me Clissold kept a record of everyone
he'd sold them to, in some sort of notepad.

45:25.180 --> 45:29.220
Now, if we can find that, maybe it'll
prove, one way or another, who was involved.

45:29.300 --> 45:33.020
I suppose she has an alibi, has she?
For the time in question. Mrs Lorimer.

45:35.260 --> 45:37.410
Well, she works. In a florist.

45:37.460 --> 45:40.010
And she was there. So far as I know.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.930
As far as you know?

45:44.780 --> 45:46.770
Well, you watch how you go, then.

45:46.820 --> 45:50.860
Getting mixed up in other people's
affairs seldom ends happily for anyone.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.530
I know what I'm doing.

45:52.580 --> 45:53.980
Do you?

45:54.060 --> 45:56.730
I'm not the one currently suspended.

45:57.740 --> 46:00.140
Was it worth it, Bernie Waters?

46:02.740 --> 46:06.180
Bernie Waters is up to something.
- It wouldn't matter if he was or wasn't.

46:06.260 --> 46:10.300
Sam off to the army. This bullet you're carrying
around. You just wanted to hurt somebody.

46:10.380 --> 46:13.050
You won't have to worry about
picking up after me any more.

46:13.100 --> 46:16.420
Your sergeant's come through. You'll
be off. And maybe it's about time.

46:16.500 --> 46:18.640
Everything in its season.

46:21.220 --> 46:23.220
Mind how you go.

46:37.740 --> 46:40.090
It's police business, Mr Fordyce.

46:40.140 --> 46:42.410
This is a most unusual request.

46:42.460 --> 46:45.090
Ordinarily, we'd require a judge's order.

46:45.140 --> 46:47.530
Unfortunately, time is of the essence.

46:47.580 --> 46:50.860
It may have a direct bearing
on Mr Clissold's murder.

46:53.620 --> 46:56.980
That's Lonsdale, isn't it, the
young man in the photograph?

46:57.060 --> 46:59.020
My son, William.

46:59.100 --> 47:01.450
He took a first in Greats last year.

47:01.500 --> 47:03.260
Well spotted.

47:03.340 --> 47:04.930
My old college.

47:04.980 --> 47:06.420
Indeed?

47:06.500 --> 47:08.090
My subject, too.

47:08.140 --> 47:10.130
Under Felix Lorimer.
- Ah.

47:10.180 --> 47:11.650
A charming man.

47:11.700 --> 47:13.700
Quite charming.

47:19.580 --> 47:22.320
Mr Clissold's safety deposit box, sir.

47:23.900 --> 47:25.890
I need a signature.
- Of course.

47:25.940 --> 47:27.340
And this.

47:29.220 --> 47:31.220
Thank you, Gidderton.

47:56.300 --> 47:58.770
Is that it?
- It looks to be.

47:59.940 --> 48:03.540
I have someone with me who
could be able to verify it.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.530
Morse!

48:11.580 --> 48:13.570
People will say we're in love.

48:13.620 --> 48:14.730
Small world.

48:14.780 --> 48:16.570
But I wouldn't want to paint it.

48:16.620 --> 48:18.250
Does it look familiar?

48:18.300 --> 48:21.540
That's it.
- All right. Nobody move. This is a robbery!

48:23.140 --> 48:26.050
Hands where I can see 'em!
Step away from the counter!

48:26.100 --> 48:28.210
OK.
- What are you doing?

48:28.260 --> 48:30.800
Stop. Stop.
- Don't look at me!

48:31.740 --> 48:35.500
Get down on the floor. Do exactly as
you're told and no one will get hurt.

48:35.580 --> 48:38.180
In five minutes, it'll all be over.

48:41.340 --> 48:44.340
Come on, then. Get on with
it! What are you waiting for?

48:44.420 --> 48:46.410
Put the money in the bag!

48:46.460 --> 48:48.890
You, where's the safe? Where's the safe?
- In here.

48:48.940 --> 48:51.330
Right. Come on, then.
With me. You stay here.

48:51.380 --> 48:53.530
Come on, I haven't got all day!
- All right.

48:53.580 --> 48:55.100
Move it!

49:04.580 --> 49:06.580
CID. Strange.

49:08.460 --> 49:11.260
Right. Get it open. Open it up. Come on!

49:12.260 --> 49:14.410
Where is it? Get it open! Come on!

49:14.460 --> 49:15.700
Move!

49:17.420 --> 49:18.730
Come on!

49:18.780 --> 49:19.930
Get down there!

49:19.980 --> 49:21.850
Don't look at me. Don't look at me!

49:21.900 --> 49:23.240
Come on!

49:24.180 --> 49:28.140
Anonymous tip-off, sir. There's a raid taking
place at the Wessex Bank on Cross Street.

49:42.260 --> 49:44.330
He's had his 20 minutes.

49:48.220 --> 49:50.020
Excuse me? Madam?

49:50.820 --> 49:52.410
Yes, sir? How can I help you?

49:52.460 --> 49:54.970
All units from Information Room.
- Sorry, sir. One moment.

49:55.020 --> 49:58.920
Suspected robbery at Wessex
Bank on Cross Street. Repeat...

50:00.900 --> 50:02.340
Get down!

50:02.420 --> 50:05.060
Clear the street! Clear the street!

50:11.820 --> 50:13.090
Come on. Let's go!

50:13.140 --> 50:14.810
Get on your feet! Get on your feet!

50:14.860 --> 50:15.970
Move!

50:16.020 --> 50:17.410
Move it! Move it!

50:17.460 --> 50:20.260
You're going to be OK. They're here now.

50:26.420 --> 50:28.220
Get back!

50:31.220 --> 50:32.620
Get back!

50:33.820 --> 50:35.220
Get back!

50:46.060 --> 50:49.980
Talk to me, Tommy. What's going on?
- It's the kid. He's shot a copper!

50:51.060 --> 50:53.820
He's done what? He's done what?

51:05.180 --> 51:06.580
Sir.

51:07.540 --> 51:10.740
This is Chief Superintendent
Reginald Bright of the City Police.

51:12.300 --> 51:14.450
To whoever is inside the Wessex Bank,

51:14.500 --> 51:17.700
you are completely
surrounded by armed officers.

51:18.100 --> 51:21.660
Lay down your arms and come
out now with your hands up.

51:25.660 --> 51:28.010
I repeat, you are completely surrounded.

51:28.060 --> 51:30.370
Lay down your arms and come out.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.460
It's all right.

51:36.580 --> 51:38.570
Well, this is no bloody use.

51:38.620 --> 51:39.900
Sir.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.600
My name is Bright. Let's
not make things worse.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.730
Put him down.
- What? Wait!

51:51.780 --> 51:53.930
Who asked you?
- Don't be so bloody stupid.

51:53.980 --> 51:55.090
Stupid?
- Yes.

51:55.140 --> 51:56.940
Do I look stupid?

51:58.060 --> 52:00.530
If you gun down a senior
police officer in cold blood,

52:00.580 --> 52:04.180
they'll hunt you to the ends
of the earth, that's all.

52:07.580 --> 52:09.330
Tell him we want transport.

52:09.380 --> 52:11.650
And safe passage guaranteed.

52:22.020 --> 52:23.610
We want a car

52:23.660 --> 52:25.980
and safe passage guaranteed.

52:26.460 --> 52:30.100
Or we start shooting.
- I'm not sure that can be arranged.

52:30.580 --> 52:33.940
You've got one hour. Or
one of this lot gets it.

52:34.020 --> 52:35.560
Your choice.

52:41.700 --> 52:42.970
Right.

52:43.020 --> 52:44.330
Whoo-hoo!

52:44.380 --> 52:46.580
Whoo-hoo! Come on!

52:48.860 --> 52:51.060
Cole? Cole!

52:52.420 --> 52:54.420
What are we gonna do?

52:55.700 --> 52:57.250
Get 'em locked up downstairs.

52:57.300 --> 52:59.290
On your feet!
- You're the manager, right?

52:59.340 --> 53:02.250
Are there any other ways out of here?
- There's a rear entrance.

53:02.300 --> 53:04.610
They'll have that covered.
What about downstairs?

53:04.660 --> 53:07.820
No. That's just used for storage.
Account records. That sort of thing.

53:07.900 --> 53:10.650
Show me. Come on! Move
it! Come on. Get in there!

53:10.700 --> 53:14.460
I need you to brief DI Barcroft. You'd
better send a car. Actually, go yourself.

53:14.540 --> 53:16.330
Where the hell is Morse?

53:16.380 --> 53:19.130
Get down there now. Come
on, move it! Move it!

53:19.180 --> 53:21.250
Right. What have we got?

53:27.100 --> 53:29.060
Ah.

53:29.140 --> 53:31.140
Would you believe it?

53:33.460 --> 53:36.000
All right, all right. I'm coming.

53:36.940 --> 53:38.900
Oi! Get down there!

53:38.980 --> 53:40.940
Keep an eye on them!

53:41.340 --> 53:44.420
I want to go home.
- We'll all go home.

53:44.500 --> 53:47.780
The police will sort it out.
- They haven't made much of a job of it so far.

53:47.860 --> 53:51.340
It's a raid that's gone wrong.
The getaway driver's panicked.

53:51.420 --> 53:54.580
The men upstairs are stranded,
frightened, and in it up to their necks.

53:54.660 --> 53:56.210
They didn't seem frightened to me.

53:56.260 --> 53:59.010
Once they realise the fix
they're in, they'll surrender.

53:59.060 --> 54:01.400
We all just need to keep calm.

54:09.020 --> 54:11.290
What's next door?
- A hotel.

54:11.340 --> 54:13.330
Any tools in the place? A crowbar?

54:13.380 --> 54:14.850
A sledgehammer?

54:14.900 --> 54:16.090
Come on!

54:16.140 --> 54:19.340
There's a fire axe.
- Where? Show me. Come on.

54:20.060 --> 54:21.860
Are you all right?

54:23.660 --> 54:25.250
Is that the one?

54:25.300 --> 54:26.580
Yeah.

54:29.420 --> 54:32.250
Not that I can see it means anything.
- Oh, it means something.

54:32.300 --> 54:36.170
Clissold didn't want anyone
else to read it. It's enciphered.

54:36.220 --> 54:39.160
Can you read it?
- Not without the key.

54:40.580 --> 54:42.380
Good luck.

54:43.060 --> 54:45.000
It's all Greek to me.

54:52.180 --> 54:53.980
He's sighted.

54:58.340 --> 55:00.610
It's a good job you're here.

55:01.460 --> 55:03.050
I mean, I'm glad.

55:03.100 --> 55:05.640
If it's any comfort.
- Me, too.

55:06.180 --> 55:07.980
Don't worry.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.700
It'll be all right.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.700
What's this?
- A puzzle.

55:14.780 --> 55:19.140
Why would a man carry around a menu for a
restaurant that long ago went out of business?

55:19.220 --> 55:21.010
I give up. Why would he?

55:21.060 --> 55:25.140
More to the point, why would he circle
just one item on the menu? Number 26.

55:25.220 --> 55:27.090
Chicken meat and sweetcorn soup.

55:27.140 --> 55:29.140
Do you know?
- Mm.

55:30.460 --> 55:32.450
Well, of what are there 26?

55:32.500 --> 55:34.180
Teeth?

55:34.260 --> 55:36.220
No. That's 32.

55:36.300 --> 55:38.930
Bones in the human foot.
- There are, but that's not it.

55:38.980 --> 55:40.570
26 cantons in Switzerland.

55:40.620 --> 55:42.580
Or is it 25?

55:42.660 --> 55:44.650
Letters in the alphabet.

55:44.700 --> 55:47.460
Of which the last and 26th is...?

55:47.540 --> 55:48.900
Z.

55:48.980 --> 55:50.500
So...

55:50.580 --> 55:52.500
26 equals Z

55:52.580 --> 55:54.490
equals C for chicken.

55:54.540 --> 55:57.140
And so it goes on. One gives us...?

55:57.980 --> 55:59.220
D.

55:59.300 --> 56:00.770
That's right.

56:00.820 --> 56:02.980
And two is E and so on.

56:03.060 --> 56:04.650
So, what does it say?

56:04.700 --> 56:12.300
Well, so far, I've got "Royal Palace 50",
"Dark Venetian 80" and "Greek Scholar 200".

56:12.380 --> 56:14.340
Maybe I was wrong.

56:14.420 --> 56:18.540
You're welcome to grab a bunch of numbers
and start turning them into letters.

56:18.620 --> 56:20.290
You're trying to keep us occupied.

56:20.340 --> 56:23.010
Which would you prefer?
Terrified or distracted?

56:23.060 --> 56:25.730
I'd sooner be thinking of a way out.

56:27.540 --> 56:29.330
Please keep me abreast.

56:29.380 --> 56:31.170
What can I do?
- Do?

56:31.220 --> 56:33.010
I'm not going to sit on my hands.

56:33.060 --> 56:35.930
With the way things are,
I'm afraid you may have to.

56:35.980 --> 56:39.940
Look, I'm leaving for the station in a
moment. Division want a progress report.

56:40.020 --> 56:42.210
I'll brief you on the way.
- Where's Morse?

56:42.260 --> 56:44.930
I don't know. Can't get hold of him.

56:45.260 --> 56:48.000
Mrs Thursday, please try not to worry.

56:49.380 --> 56:52.170
Fred, what did he mean,
"With the way things are"?

56:52.220 --> 56:54.210
Mrs Thursday. Inspector.

56:54.260 --> 56:56.050
There's no story, Miss Frazil.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.490
Not today.
- I know. I know.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.450
I just thought we could have a cup of tea.

56:59.500 --> 57:02.860
There's nothing on the record today,
Inspector. I'd just like to help.

57:02.940 --> 57:04.530
I wouldn't mind a cup of tea, Fred.

57:04.580 --> 57:08.280
I'll be at the station with
Mr Bright. I won't be long.

57:08.780 --> 57:10.850
Come on.
- Thank you.

57:14.420 --> 57:15.900
All right?

57:17.580 --> 57:19.370
They just shot him.

57:19.420 --> 57:21.360
Like it was nothing.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.220
Here.

57:25.300 --> 57:27.300
For the nerves.

57:30.700 --> 57:34.980
Keep the pack. Stick 'em behind
your notebook, then nobody will know.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.540
Thanks.

57:36.620 --> 57:38.960
A tip my old guv'nor gave me.

57:40.860 --> 57:44.020
Sergeant Vimes. Cable Street.

57:45.100 --> 57:46.780
No pasaran.

57:46.860 --> 57:48.330
All right?

57:49.380 --> 57:52.250
Let's have that jacket buttoned up, then.

57:52.940 --> 57:54.340
Sir.

58:05.180 --> 58:07.520
You'd better look after this.

58:12.580 --> 58:15.660
What did you mean? About Paul?

58:16.660 --> 58:19.860
Just that I've come across
him in my travels. That's all.

58:21.220 --> 58:23.090
You deserve better.

58:27.820 --> 58:29.890
He asked me about work.

58:33.540 --> 58:36.540
When we had deliveries
for the weekend float.

58:37.420 --> 58:40.700
I thought it was just conversation.
But it wasn't, was it?

58:41.860 --> 58:43.650
Did you let on about...?

58:43.700 --> 58:44.940
Dad?

58:45.020 --> 58:48.020
No fear.
- Well, that's something, at least.

58:52.020 --> 58:54.010
You two know each other, do you?

58:54.060 --> 58:56.330
We've a mutual acquaintance.

58:57.140 --> 58:59.130
Oh, yeah? Who's that, then?

58:59.180 --> 59:00.980
No-one you'd know.

59:01.740 --> 59:04.290
It's like that, is it, then?
- It's like that.

59:04.340 --> 59:06.300
"Charlott own."

59:06.380 --> 59:08.370
Doesn't make any sense.

59:08.420 --> 59:11.720
Charlott, without an E,
own. Charlotte owns what?

59:16.700 --> 59:19.210
You, what's your name?
- Ronnie Gidderton.

59:19.260 --> 59:20.530
And you?
- Morse.

59:20.580 --> 59:22.920
Right, on your feet. Come on!

59:26.220 --> 59:27.810
Just in case.
- Aw! Yeah.

59:27.860 --> 59:30.530
Yeah, very touching. Move your arse!

59:39.320 --> 59:41.590
It must be nice. A daughter.

59:42.400 --> 59:44.200
She's a good girl.

59:44.880 --> 59:46.270
The best.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.110
I know I'm her mother, but...

59:48.160 --> 59:49.750
She'll be all right.

59:49.800 --> 59:50.990
Yeah.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.510
Fred'll sort it.

59:52.560 --> 59:54.230
He always does.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.500
Yes, sir. Understood.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.960
Of course.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.040
I'm sorry. I'm afraid Division won't wear
it. You are to remain suspended from duty.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.440
Thursday.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.040
Before the Blenheim
Vale files were sealed...

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.400
...one final piece of
evidence was abstracted.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.840
I don't suppose anyone
will miss it in 50 years.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.830
All right.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.550
You take over.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.760
That as far as you've got?

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.430
Who's in charge with you lot?

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.470
What's it to you?
- I want to talk to him.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.460
Oh, yeah? About what?

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.190
Something to your advantage.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.400
Fetch him.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.390
What are you doing sat on your arse?

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.390
Cole.
- What?

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.000
One of the hostages wants to speak
to you. The young blond-haired one.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.020
He knows something...

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.440
So?

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.790
You want a coach, don't you?

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.710
What if I could make sure you get it?

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.100
Ronnie.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.520
Banking, it's all about trust.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.430
Investment and return.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.470
The customer gives us their money.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.510
They trust us to invest it wisely.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.760
And, for their trust, we make sure they get
something back, more than they originally gave.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.920
Look, if I trust you with something
guaranteed to get you what you want...

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.910
...that's got to be worth
something, hasn't it?

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.960
Like what?

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.950
Letting you walk out?
- Not just me.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.760
Everybody.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.640
Well, nearly.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.150
Why not?
- So what have you got?

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.700
I need your word.
- Huh, the word of a bank robber.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.680
All right. You've got my word.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.470
Him. He's a policeman.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:14.240
He's lying. He doesn't know what he's
saying. He's just trying to get out of here.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.230
You've got one of theirs, they'll
have to give you what you want.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.520
I've never seen this man before
today. I came in here for a loan.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.430
I came in here for a loan, didn't I?
- Well, somebody's lying.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.080
And I don't like liars.
- He'll have identification.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.280
It's clean.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.940
Nice try.
- No, no, I can prove it.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.500
How? How?
- Aah! Someone else knows him.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.980
She'll tell you.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.950
That's the hour, isn't it?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.470
More or less.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.640
They won't really make good
on their threat, will they?

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.280
Come on.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.080
You, come here.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.060
Come on!

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.560
What's your name?

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.640
Joan.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.440
Joan what?
- Strange.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.040
Joan Strange.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.360
Is that right? Joan Strange?
- Yes.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.470
And who's this?

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.710
I don't know.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.830
I never seen him before.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.520
You see, this one says
that one is a copper.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.470
He says you know him.
- I don't. He's just a customer.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.390
He's just a customer?
- He isn't!

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.040
Joan, tell him.
- Is that right?

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.860
He's just a customer?

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.240
Yeah.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.080
So if I was to...

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.870
Aargh!

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.460
Oh, my God.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.280
Look at me. Look at me!

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.350
If I was to do that to him,
that'd be all right with you?

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.680
Just leave her. He's telling the
truth. I'm a police officer. Let her go.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.120
E Morse?

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.190
Detective Constable, City Police.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.230
You knew all along? You bastard.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.150
It was on his desk.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.910
I told you. I don't like liars.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.830
But I hate a grass!

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.550
She will be all right.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.430
Where are you going?
- You're not the only one who took an oath.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.190
Bless you, doc. But I can't let you go.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.000
Let me? You do your job, I'll do mine.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.400
If they have made good on their threat, we're
gonna need you for after, to make it stick.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.120
Please, doc. If anything happened to
you, Mr Bright would have my guts.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.440
Who's she?

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.320
Joan Thursday. Please, no more violence.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.920
Good man.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.080
Remind me. An inspector
outranks a constable, doesn't he?

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.950
So what do I need you for?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.270
Kill me, you'll never know who set you up.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.760
What?

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.110
You think it's an accident that I'm here?

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.240
That we had the place surrounded in
five minutes? Somebody sold you out.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.940
Maybe we should hear him out.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.110
Put him down.
- No!

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.790
No, please! No!
- Oi!

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.110
Aah...

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.440
Be a man.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.800
Answer it.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.680
Wessex Bank. Howard
Fordyce, manager, speaking.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.710
He wants to speak to whoever's in charge.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.510
Who's this?
- You know who this is.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.560
Listen to me, Cole.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.040
You let the staff and the customers go now
and that's that. The law takes its course.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.110
Say we don't.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.350
Then I'll put you in the ground.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.120
Ooh, big talk for a lung-er.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.990
I'm a lung-er, all right.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.310
The doc's given me three weeks.

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:22.160
Bad luck for you.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.470
Bad luck for both of us.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.990
How's that?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.840
I can go in my bed, with
posterity gathered solemn round.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.069
Or I can go standing toe-to-toe with you.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.310
I know which I'd sooner.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.359
But it's your choice. What's it to be?

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:43.950
I'll take my chances.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.510
Never bet against a man
with nothing to lose.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.660
Oh, you've got something
to lose, all right.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.920
I'm looking at her, right now.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.270
We've got another of yours here, too.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.399
A cocky little toe-rag. Name of Morse.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.880
So you listen. You get
your people off the street.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:11.600
We want a coach and safe
passage to London Airport.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.540
I see one copper between here and there...

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:19.109
...your girl will be the first to go.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.640
I know you.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.540
I've seen you down The Royal.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.240
I don't think so.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.720
You're Nina.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.760
Paul Marlock's bit.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.910
It's all right.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.500
You've got nothing to worry about.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.270
Paul's family.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.740
We'll see you're looked after.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.990
I'm sorry, Joan.
- No, shush now. Come on.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.000
Help is on its way.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.550
I just wanted to get
everyone out of here...

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.270
I know. I know.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.560
Be a hero...

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.980
We were never going home, were we?

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.720
No.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.800
It was life from the second the
boy took a pop at the copper.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.700
Back inside?

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.800
We'll give 'em a dance, though, eh?

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.680
Mr Fordyce...

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.760
your son was stroke in the
Oxford boat last year, wasn't he?

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.320
What of it?

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.640
You wrote a cheque to L1500.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.710
Made out to cash.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.430
Last July. What... what was that for?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.260
You have to tell me the truth now.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.480
Right. Take 'em out.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.270
Move it! Come on.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.990
Clissold's pad.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.840
Oi! You not coming?

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.830
No. We'll buy you time. Keep
'em busy, they try anything.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.310
Open the doors!
- No, no, no, no. Not you two.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.710
Through there.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.300
Move it! Come on!
- All right.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.480
Go! Go! Get behind me!

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.470
On you go!

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.630
Move it. Come on. Come on!

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.320
Move it!

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.510
Move!
- Just let us go. We'll only hold you up.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.070
You're our ticket out of this.
- Leave her. She's done.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.820
You only have to look at her.
- Better get a second wind, hadn't she?

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.240
With me.

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.630
If anything happens,
give this to your father.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.670
What is it?
- It's the reason Cedric Clissold was killed.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.360
It's blank.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.800
Charlottown. Park Royal. Dark
Venetian. They're horses. All of them.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.070
Move it!

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.750
It was always about the money.
- What was?

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.920
Tell your father to arrest Felix
and Nina Lorimer and Paul Marlock

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.510
for the murder of Cedric Clissold.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.070
I thought it was a robbery.
- They intended to kill him.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.720
Keep it down!

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.950
Where are they?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.340
It's locked!
- Blow it off.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.640
Come on. Move. Move it!

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.880
Bloody hell! Open the door!

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.540
Drop it.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.240
Move it. Come on.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.830
Come on, get on with it.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.780
Yes?
- Right.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.600
Go. Go. Go. Go. Move it!

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.100
Go, go, go.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.640
Armed police!

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.720
Move!... Come on!

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.550
Get over there now!

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.640
Head down! Move it!

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.960
Aaargh!

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.660
Aargh!
- Pete? Are you all right, Pete?

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.160
Throw the gun out! Or she gets it.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.310
Aaargh...
- Drop it!

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.340
Put it down!

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.040
The chamber's empty. Only he's
too stupid to count to six.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.390
I'll show you stupid!

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.780
Aaargh!

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.020
Take me in, then, lawman.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.880
Do it.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.990
Do it!
- Sir, don't.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.280
Not here. Not like this. Don't...
Don't let her see you do this.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.830
Dad?
- Show them who you are.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.980
This is who I am.
- No! It never has been.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.400
We hold the line. If you cross
it now, then there's no way back.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.640
With me. Now.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.720
Thursday?

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.160
Sergeant Strange.
- Sir.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.000
Take him in.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.760
Get up!

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.240
Aah!

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.200
Well, how many was it? Was it five or six?

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.520
Tell me!

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.780
How many?
- I told you. You were empty.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.640
Are you all right?

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.280
Morse?

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.640
We have to act fast. The one loose
end in Lorimer's plan is Paul Marlock.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.310
How's that?
- Let me explain.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.680
Clissold lent Lorimer thousands of
pounds to pay off his gambling debts.

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.080
Lorimer was obviously in way over his
head. In order to meet the interest,

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.520
Lorimer started selling degrees to
undergrads that didn't merit them.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.470
Such as Howard Fordyce's son.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.280
When Clissold's fashion business got into
trouble, I think he called in the loan.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.110
Only Lorimer couldn't pay.
- No.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.950
So that's why they killed Clissold.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.440
Well, no, that's why they conspired to kill
him. Nina knew Paul Marlock from the bingo.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.390
It was him that pulled the trigger.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.040
But she was never serious about
him. She only had eyes for Lorimer.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.400
Marlock's real job was to get the
pad, listing Lorimer's debts.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.190
But the pad wasn't there,
so they used me to get it.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.560
So it was nothing to do with the blue films?
- No. That was all a ruse.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.550
Intended to lead me up the
garden path, which it did.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.880
Number one, Kelly's eye.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.600
Harold's den. Number ten.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:22.600
3-0, blind 30.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.120
Paul Marlock, you're under arrest
for the murder of Cedric Clissold.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.160
Going somewhere?
- End of term.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.520
Detective Inspector Thursday,
Dr Lorimer, City Police.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.580
Oh, Mrs Lorimer. All forgiven?

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.870
We've decided to give it another go.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.520
After what happened in the bank,
nearly losing Nina like that.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.320
Well, you got what you
wanted. Clissold's carbon pad.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.270
Listing exactly what you owed him.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.600
You destroyed it, presumably.
- I don't know what you mean.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.080
Then it's a good job Morse
pinched out the carbon copies.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.760
You're lying.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.190
When?
- A situation like that,

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.030
it could easily have been mislaid.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.950
We've also got Paul
Marlock. Your intended patsy.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
He's already talking
about turning Queen's.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.320
You used me.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.230
You always had a weakness
for the fairer sex.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.240
People don't change.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.310
It was nothing personal.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.120
I had to get back Clissold's
pad. You do see that?

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.710
So you had a man killed.
- Not a very nice man.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.760
Not one of us, Morse.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.550
If it had come out about
my selling degrees...

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.590
I had to think of the college.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.980
You were thinking of yourself.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.230
No.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.950
Actually, it was Nina.
- You've ruined her life.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.360
Dragged her down with you.
- I didn't have a life until I met Felix.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.780
I don't want one without him.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.760
You know what I was.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.040
Please. One moment, please.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.600
He was the first man who ever looked at me as
if I was something more than just a good time.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.860
I'd do it all again.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.300
Without a second thought.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Love, Morse.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.320
Imagine that.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.080
So where's the money?

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.560
We'll find it at Paul Marlock's.
The gun too, I should think.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.200
Who tipped us off about the bank raid?
- My money's on Larry Nelson.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:52.720
He's after Peter Matthews' wife. At least,
that's how it looked at the funeral.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.800
So he tips us off, Cole
and Peter get lifted.

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:59.920
He can carry on with Sheila, maybe
get a shot at the title himself.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.270
I saw what you did for Joan.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:09.840
There was a bullet left in the chamber,
whatever you told Cole Matthews.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.920
You knew it.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.800
You drew his fire.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:27.120
You should get back to
her, see she's all right.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.120
Yeah.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.720
I just keep seeing Ronnie.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.670
It's my fault.
- No.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.880
You fell foul, that's all.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.160
A good night's sleep, you'll
feel better in the morning.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.600
Eh, Mum?

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.420
Nature's remedy.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.120
Yeah.

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.200
A good night's sleep.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.780
Good night.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.580
She'll be all right.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.580
I just wanted to get everyone out of here.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.160
Do I look stupid?

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:55.440
Put him down.
- No!

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.270
It's a good job you're
here. I mean, I'm glad.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.680
Me, too.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.030
It's probably best if I wait in...

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.880
I think it's probably best
if you just do as you're told.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.710
What do they call you, then?
- Morse.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:24.870
Morse.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:29.440
Thought I'd be all right with a copper.
- There are coppers and there are coppers.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.160
What sort are you?
- The sort that sees young ladies safely home.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.920
I think this is the bit where I
say, "Thanks for a lovely evening."

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.830
And we have a long kiss
under the porch light,

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.480
until my dad taps on the window
and then I go in and you go home.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.680
Love, I suppose. You don't know
until you meet the right one.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.920
No. Don't suppose.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.680
Miss Thursday, where are you going?

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.120
Like this?

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.240
I have to.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.750
Well, where will you go?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.600
I don't know.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.030
Stay.
- I can't.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.670
Just give it time.

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.710
Everything that happened,

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.760
just give it a chance.

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.720
You mean the world to them.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.040
You mean the world...

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.840
Look after them.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.780
Dad won't understand.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.710
If you need anything...

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.720
...money or a voice on the
phone, you know where to find me.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.100
You should get something on that.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.940
Take care of yourself, Morse.

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.240
You too, Miss Thursday.
