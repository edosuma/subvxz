CATHERINE: <i>Nine years ago,</i>
<i>I witnessed my mother's murder.</i>

00:05.988 --> 00:09.123
I would have been killed, too,
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:09.125 --> 00:12.743
VINCENT: <i>I was part of an experimental</i>
<i>special forces group.</i>

00:12.745 --> 00:15.863
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

00:15.865 --> 00:18.198
<i>They made us stronger,</i>
<i>faster, better.</i>

00:18.200 --> 00:20.017
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:20.019 --> 00:21.885
<i>They gave orders</i>
<i>to kill us all.</i>

00:21.887 --> 00:24.805
<i>Somehow I survived and have</i>
<i>been in hiding ever since.</i>

00:24.807 --> 00:26.790
CATHERINE: <i>Until a case brought me</i>
<i>back to him,</i>

00:26.792 --> 00:30.043
<i>but also alerted the group</i>
<i>that experimented on him.</i>

00:30.045 --> 00:32.762
<i>Now we're both in danger.</i>

00:32.765 --> 00:36.575
VINCENT: And our best chance at survival
<i>is if we save each other.</i>

Okay, I know it's
risky. It's just,

01:45.621 --> 01:46.920
I have no other
way to reach him.

01:46.922 --> 01:48.305
I can't go to
the warehouse.

01:48.307 --> 01:49.640
He doesn't have a
phone, no e-mail.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.458
Yeah, no Twitter, either.
You know why?

01:51.460 --> 01:52.843
He can't have
any followers.

01:52.845 --> 01:54.595
Everyone needs
to believe he's dead,

01:54.597 --> 01:56.630
or he will be for real.
Okay, it's just, we said

01:56.632 --> 01:58.398
that we'd be in touch,
and I haven't heard

01:58.400 --> 02:00.067
from him in, like, a week, so...
What?

02:00.069 --> 02:01.735
He hasn't called?

from him in three days,

02:03.405 --> 02:04.638

02:06.025 --> 02:07.524
Do you not understand
what's going on here?

02:07.526 --> 02:09.443
He is a genetically-altered...

02:16.001 --> 02:18.619
I hadn't heard

03:23.051 --> 03:25.235
so I thought
I'd get a workout in, which...

03:25.237 --> 03:27.654
you clearly did.

03:27.656 --> 03:29.656
(laughs) I am so sorry.
No.

03:29.658 --> 03:31.491
No, it's okay. You're making
yourself comfortable

03:31.493 --> 03:32.943
in your new apartment.

03:32.945 --> 03:34.361
Yeah.

03:34.363 --> 03:35.895
Speaking of, Dad wants to know

03:35.897 --> 03:37.414
who you're bringing
to the wedding.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.833
He thinks you're not
filling out the RSVP card

03:39.835 --> 03:41.234
because of the plus one.

03:41.236 --> 03:42.669
I am busy.

03:42.671 --> 03:44.755
It takes five seconds
to lick the envelope.

03:44.757 --> 03:47.724
What about that cute
medical examiner you work with?

03:47.726 --> 03:50.093
Evan? He is a total player.

03:50.095 --> 03:51.211
You like players.

03:51.213 --> 03:52.763
I do not like anyone right now.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.765
Just invite someone
because Dad's freaked out.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.050
He thinks you're going
to be alone forever.

03:57.052 --> 03:58.935
(phone ringing)

04:01.146 --> 04:02.811
It's work.
I need to get in the shower.

04:02.812 --> 04:04.325
Can you make sure
that Josh is not in it?

04:04.436 --> 04:05.907
(laughs)

04:05.932 --> 04:07.622
I'll tell Dad it's in the mail.

04:14.402 --> 04:16.820

CATHERINE: I just walked in

04:16.822 --> 04:19.072
on my sister and a friend
christening my apartment.

04:19.074 --> 04:21.208
Ooh, I'd charge
extra rent for that.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.959
Not quite as salacious.
Hit-and-run.

04:22.961 --> 04:24.961
Why is Joe here
for a hit-and-run?

04:24.963 --> 04:27.113
Well, it looks like a homicide.
Victim's Judge Hanson.

04:27.115 --> 04:29.583
The immigration judge?
Yeah, they played squash together.

04:29.585 --> 04:31.218
Hanson helped Joe's
housekeeper get her papers.

04:31.220 --> 04:32.669
MAN: Hey, it's the
Estrogen Squad.

04:32.671 --> 04:34.004
That's still as hilarious

04:34.006 --> 04:35.288
as the first ten times

04:35.290 --> 04:36.590
you said it, Wilansky.

04:36.592 --> 04:38.291
(sighs)

04:38.293 --> 04:40.844
Security cameras
missed a direct visual.

04:40.846 --> 04:42.396
Law clerk caught
the whole thing.

04:42.398 --> 04:43.797
The driver went straight for him,
Lieutenant?

04:43.799 --> 04:45.098
then reversed back over.
Thank you.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.483
Sounds personal.

04:46.485 --> 04:47.734
Personal and
merciless and gross.

04:47.736 --> 04:49.019
Clerk got the plates.

04:49.021 --> 04:51.471
Car's registered
to an Iris Sodkovic.

04:51.473 --> 04:52.806
She's a waitress
at the Club Veraban.

04:52.808 --> 04:54.157
Sodkovic. Veraban.
They both sound like

04:54.159 --> 04:55.809
they could have been cases
of his.

04:55.811 --> 04:57.411
Sodkovic was.

04:57.413 --> 04:59.830
The judge just deported her
brother three days ago.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.948
Oh, so maybe a little
sisterly payback?

05:01.950 --> 05:04.868
Sounds like it. Address on the registration.
We're on it.

05:04.870 --> 05:06.670
Uh, Wilansky and
Boggs are point.

05:07.988 --> 05:09.673
Of course, we miss
the high profile case.

05:09.675 --> 05:11.875
Nothing personal.
They're up in the rotation.

05:11.877 --> 05:14.044
You two, back them up
on the arrest.

05:16.997 --> 05:18.548
Blood and tissue
along here.

05:18.550 --> 05:19.966
Engine's still warm.

05:19.968 --> 05:21.518
She must have just gotten home.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.270
Hey, we're gonna
go around the back.

05:23.272 --> 05:26.440
Uh, we got this. Just call
for an impound and sit tight.

05:26.442 --> 05:29.526
Can you believe I had to partner
with that guy for two years?

05:29.528 --> 05:32.729
Strange to mow someone over with
your own car and not even wipe

05:32.731 --> 05:34.197
the blood off the fender.

05:34.199 --> 05:36.032
Well, maybe Iris is inside
getting a paper towel.

05:36.034 --> 05:39.820
It's Vargas. I need a tow
and forensics team on standby.

05:39.822 --> 05:41.154
Hey, Tess, isn't that, uh...?

05:41.156 --> 05:42.572
You Iris Sodkovic?

05:42.574 --> 05:43.990
NYPD, stop!

05:50.798 --> 05:52.916
TESS:
Stop!

05:55.202 --> 05:56.553
(grunting)

05:56.555 --> 05:59.139
Please, please.
I have green card.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.040
You're under arrest for the
murder of Judge Brian Hanson.

06:01.042 --> 06:04.060
What? He-He's dead?

06:05.596 --> 06:08.014
(horns honking)

06:08.016 --> 06:10.400
She said she has a green card.
What?

06:10.402 --> 06:11.985
If she murdered a judge,

06:11.987 --> 06:13.904
why would she be
worrying about that?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.239
Uh, I'd worry about
having a green card, too.

06:16.241 --> 06:17.691
Prison in Bosnia
probably makes prison

06:17.693 --> 06:19.743
here feel like
a five-star resort.

06:19.745 --> 06:21.828
Yeah, but it seemed like she
didn't even know he was dead.

06:21.830 --> 06:24.247
Look, as much as I'd like
for Wilansky to actually have

06:24.249 --> 06:27.000
to work to close this thing,
it feels like a slam dunk.

06:27.002 --> 06:28.585
Driver reversed
over the judge.

06:28.587 --> 06:30.737
We assumed it was
to finish the job, but maybe

06:30.739 --> 06:33.423
he knew there were cameras,
and he wanted the plates seen

06:33.425 --> 06:34.791
so that he could frame Iris.

06:34.793 --> 06:36.242
Frame Iris?

06:36.244 --> 06:38.595
Cat, this is not our case.

06:38.597 --> 06:40.130
Even though we're the
ones who took her down.

06:40.132 --> 06:42.182
I'm gonna remind him.

06:46.938 --> 06:49.639
Iris?

06:49.641 --> 06:51.191
I'm Detective Chandler.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.960
We sort of met
earlier today.

06:53.962 --> 06:56.146

afternoon?

06:57.866 --> 06:59.566
Walking home.

06:59.568 --> 07:02.085
Was there anyone with you?
No.

07:02.087 --> 07:04.287

who can corroborate?

07:04.289 --> 07:07.824

07:13.714 --> 07:17.717
Why not?

07:17.719 --> 07:21.555
I can't help you

08:41.187 --> 08:42.570
I'm your carrier
pigeon, passing notes

08:42.572 --> 08:44.188

08:48.393 --> 08:49.527
What?

08:51.496 --> 08:53.831
Apparently not tonight.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.617
She's here?
So "carefully" means

08:56.619 --> 08:58.419
not careful at all. Got it.

08:58.421 --> 09:01.171
JT, come on.
(knocking)

09:01.173 --> 09:03.257
Hey.

09:03.259 --> 09:04.675
Hey.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.994
I got your note.

09:06.996 --> 09:09.746
What note?
You already wrote her back?

09:09.748 --> 09:13.017
Vincent, how do you know?
I saw her.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.018
Where? When?

09:14.020 --> 09:15.569
Who?

09:15.571 --> 09:17.087
Around 4:00
on 123rd.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.640
123rd-- that is her apartment.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.175
That's near school.

09:21.177 --> 09:23.143
But seriously,
who are we talking about?

09:23.145 --> 09:25.596
A suspect in a case.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.231
That's what
you're in touch about?

09:28.483 --> 09:29.766
You gonna start
going on stakeouts?

09:29.768 --> 09:31.118
No.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.453
I saw Catherine arrest

09:32.455 --> 09:34.121
a woman who was
innocent, okay.

09:34.123 --> 09:35.772
I thought she should know,
that's it.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.641
Wait. You-you <i>saw</i> me arrest her?

09:37.643 --> 09:41.662
And earlier, at the school...?

09:43.014 --> 09:44.999
Have you been following me?

09:46.585 --> 09:50.387
After the attack last week,
I've kept tabs, yeah.

09:50.389 --> 09:51.505
JT:
Okay.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.724
We're all gonna die.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.792
I'm getting a Tums.

09:55.794 --> 09:59.897
Um... well, did you see
what she was doing?

09:59.899 --> 10:01.682
She was walking, alone.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.584
Um, she had a paper bag.

10:03.586 --> 10:05.736
What was in it?
Where-where was she going?

10:05.738 --> 10:07.471
I don't know, okay?
I'm not Batman.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.473
I don't watch over
the citizens of New York.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.575
No, it's just... it's
frustrating. I had this feeling

10:11.577 --> 10:14.478
she was innocent,
and now you've confirmed it.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.196
You're a witness,

10:16.198 --> 10:17.998
but you can't come forward.
No,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.317
I can't, okay?
I can't get involved.

10:20.319 --> 10:23.704
JT:
Exactly, so stop writing notes.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.509
Thanks for the confirmation.

10:32.631 --> 10:34.648
♪ Well, she's without

10:34.650 --> 10:37.017
♪ The money in paper

10:37.019 --> 10:38.936

Autumn cleaning?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.178
Medical Examiners Association's

10:48.180 --> 10:49.613
paying me a visit.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.665
Turns out that my old assistant

10:51.667 --> 10:52.958
wasn't filing the paperwork
the right way.

10:52.983 --> 10:54.015
Is it a big deal?

10:54.016 --> 10:55.918
Well, they've been known
to bring down the hammer,

10:56.072 --> 10:57.538
send an M.E. off to--

10:57.540 --> 11:00.040
what's the American version
of Siberia?

11:00.042 --> 11:01.575
Well, I hope
that doesn't happen.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.160
What would I do without you?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.628
I'm sure you'd survive.

11:05.530 --> 11:06.630
What's up?

11:06.632 --> 11:08.031
Uh, Hanson case.

11:08.033 --> 11:10.384
Did CSU's come in
with any prints or hair

11:10.386 --> 11:12.580
or any odd personal items
from the vehicle?

11:12.605 --> 11:13.421
Nope.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.590
Guess it's low-priority with
the perp already in custody.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.375
But we're waiting for
DNA results from the car.

11:18.377 --> 11:19.893
What about the autopsy
on the judge?

11:19.895 --> 11:21.595
He was just here.
Bloody mess.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.548
You know what two tons of steel
can do to a man's insides?

11:24.550 --> 11:27.718
But now look-- so clean,
you can see yourself.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.654
How about <i>seeing</i> anything that
might suggest a different theory

11:30.656 --> 11:31.989
or suspect?

11:31.991 --> 11:33.557
Is this his stuff?

11:33.559 --> 11:35.058
What are you doing?
I am

11:35.060 --> 11:36.944
dotting my I's
and crossing my T's.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.780
Aren't they Wilansky's
I's and T's?

11:39.782 --> 11:42.783
V&P Valet.
17 East 34th Street.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.202
That's the same block
that Iris worked at.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.754
What are you thinking?

11:46.756 --> 11:49.189
Well... maybe Iris and
the judge were connected

11:49.191 --> 11:52.042
by more than just her
brother's deportation case.

11:53.845 --> 11:56.463
I take it you're
not the pizza guy.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.682
Not that he would ever
bring pizza in here.

11:58.684 --> 11:59.883
(Evan chuckles)

12:01.436 --> 12:03.587
(siren wailing in distance)

12:03.589 --> 12:06.523
CATHERINE: <i>Who was bartending</i>
<i>two nights ago?</i>

12:06.525 --> 12:08.058
Sam. He's right
over there.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.926
What can I do for you?

12:09.928 --> 12:11.928
Your valet's not here yet.

12:11.930 --> 12:14.198
Do you guys use, uh...

12:14.200 --> 12:16.567
this company?
We do.

12:18.102 --> 12:19.953
Do you recognize him?

12:19.955 --> 12:21.438
The judge who was
recently murdered?

12:21.440 --> 12:23.106
Yeah, he's been in here
a couple of times.

12:23.108 --> 12:24.541
He was murdered?
Hit-and-run.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.276
The stub was in his pocket.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.462
Wow. Um...

12:28.464 --> 12:30.998
let me get the owner for you.
Yo, Dane!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.500
Yeah?
Up front!

12:33.502 --> 12:35.169
Please.

12:37.455 --> 12:40.641
You, uh, do you
remember this guy?

12:41.626 --> 12:43.594
Yeah. It's, uh, Iris's guy.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.162
What about him?

12:45.164 --> 12:48.015
He's dead. And Iris
is accused of murdering him.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.484
Were they in a...
relationship?

12:50.486 --> 12:53.403
Uh... I don't know if
you'd call it that.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.138
I mean... she
worked him, but...

12:55.140 --> 12:56.323
Because of her
brother's case?

12:56.325 --> 12:57.941
She couldn't get
over the fact

12:57.943 --> 13:00.360
that she'd gotten a green
card and he'd been denied.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.979
Hey, look, I don't want to get
anyone into any trouble, but,

13:02.981 --> 13:05.115
uh, I did see him and
Iris have an argument

13:05.117 --> 13:06.817
by the bathrooms a
couple of nights ago.

13:06.819 --> 13:09.503
I don't know what it was about,
but she was pissed.

13:09.505 --> 13:11.588
After her brother's ruling.

13:12.874 --> 13:15.375
Okay, so the press were
all over the Hanson case,

13:15.377 --> 13:18.161
and I swear Wilansky got Botox'd
just for photo ops.

13:18.163 --> 13:19.963
So, where are you,
'cause I'm about to puke.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.131
Yeah, don't do that.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.850
Thank you.
I'll let myself out?

13:22.852 --> 13:25.185
I am at Iris's apartment.

13:25.187 --> 13:27.003
(whispers):
What?!

13:27.005 --> 13:29.005
Wilansky will kill you
if he finds out.

13:29.007 --> 13:30.224
I went by the club

13:30.226 --> 13:31.675
that she works at.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.727
Turns out her and Hanson
were in a relationship.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.230
Okay, so now she has
<i>two</i> motives to kill him:

13:36.232 --> 13:37.898
her brother's case
or some lovers' quarrel.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.149
Or...

13:39.151 --> 13:41.068
maybe it's a third party.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.853
Maybe an ex-boyfriend

13:42.855 --> 13:45.372
or one of the judge's
old girlfriends?

13:45.374 --> 13:47.074
This isn't our case.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.542
Yeah, but I don't think
she did this.

13:48.544 --> 13:49.793
Why, 'cause she's a cute girl?

13:49.795 --> 13:50.994
You don't take her seriously

13:50.996 --> 13:52.212
as a criminal,
just like Wilansky

13:52.214 --> 13:53.213
doesn't take us seriously

13:53.215 --> 13:54.248
as detectives.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.300
Tess, I am not the enemy.

13:59.671 --> 14:04.007
And... there's a men's
extra large shirt in here.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.876
Judge Hanson wasn't
an extra large.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.477
Wilansky's coming
over to gloat.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.146
I got to go.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.932
Did you watch and learn?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.985
(muffled coughing in distance)

14:19.357 --> 14:21.942
(girl coughing)

14:38.259 --> 14:39.676
(gasps)

14:41.346 --> 14:43.463
It's okay, it's okay.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.666
I'm a police detective.
You're safe.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.005
My name's Catherine.

14:52.974 --> 14:55.192
What's your names?

14:56.277 --> 14:57.978
(coughs)

14:59.147 --> 15:01.531
Do you speak English?

15:02.817 --> 15:04.868
M-My name is Cena.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.170
She's Mila.

15:10.708 --> 15:13.460
♪

15:21.803 --> 15:23.553
What now?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.005
(pants)

15:25.007 --> 15:27.457
Okay, I know you
don't get involved,

15:27.459 --> 15:31.144
but I-I need your help,
just this once.

15:31.146 --> 15:33.480
It's about the case, Iris...
I'm not Batman,

15:33.482 --> 15:35.182
remember?
You say that,

15:35.184 --> 15:39.019
but... those six cases
I found of you saving people...

15:39.021 --> 15:40.604
Yeah, I go out at
night sometimes.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.606
If I stumble across
something, I will help out,

15:42.608 --> 15:44.258
but I don't go
looking for it.

15:44.260 --> 15:47.411
Iris has two little sisters,

15:47.413 --> 15:50.697
and one of them is sick--
she can hardly breathe.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.333
So take her to the ER.
They're here illegally.

15:53.335 --> 15:56.169
I take them to the ER, they'd get
reported, they'd get sent home.

15:56.171 --> 15:58.372
I can't, okay?
I can't be seen.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.542
I would be putting you,
me and JT at risk.

16:00.567 --> 16:03.337
Okay, but you won't be seen,
because they're in hiding, too.

16:05.247 --> 16:08.465
Vincent, please,
you're a doctor.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.600
I <i>was</i> a doctor.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.769
I'm sorry.

16:14.055 --> 16:16.640
Do you remember
what that was like?

16:17.475 --> 16:20.060
Helping people?

16:23.481 --> 16:25.699
Just this once.

16:34.416 --> 16:35.867
(siren wailing in distance)

16:35.869 --> 16:37.661
CATHERINE:
Cena? Mila?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.830
It's Catherine.

16:40.698 --> 16:43.399
I brought a doctor to see you.

16:46.421 --> 16:48.071
It's okay.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.123
He's here to help.

16:50.958 --> 16:52.592
Um...

16:52.594 --> 16:56.579
I'm just gonna
sit right here, okay?

17:04.972 --> 17:06.589
I need you

17:06.590 --> 17:08.442
to put this under your tongue.

17:09.977 --> 17:12.028
It's okay.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.646
It's okay, see?

17:13.648 --> 17:14.931
See?

17:16.651 --> 17:18.652
Yeah, it's okay.

17:20.137 --> 17:22.172
It's okay.

17:24.192 --> 17:26.960
Stethoscope.
Yeah.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.996
Okay, I'm gonna need her
to lean forward.

17:29.998 --> 17:32.799
(speaks quietly)

17:37.171 --> 17:38.839
Okay.

17:38.841 --> 17:41.457
Deep breaths, okay?

17:42.677 --> 17:44.794
(Mila breathing steadily)

17:47.298 --> 17:49.299
(sighs) Okay.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.151
Thank you.

17:52.469 --> 17:55.155
Take this.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.691
(sighs) 103.

17:57.693 --> 18:00.443
I'm gonna have
to get ahold of JT.

18:00.445 --> 18:01.644
(phone beeps)

18:01.646 --> 18:03.029
You have a phone?

18:03.031 --> 18:04.197
Hey.

18:04.199 --> 18:05.165
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.416
Okay, look, listen,

18:06.418 --> 18:07.918
you got a pen?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.820
Okay, write this down
before you react, okay?

18:10.822 --> 18:14.674
I'm gonna need a nebulizer,
.05% albuterol.

18:14.676 --> 18:18.211
100 milligrams cephalexin
q.i.d. for ten days.

18:18.213 --> 18:21.965
Yeah, and... oral
prednisone, 7.5 migs.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.434
Get them from
the university lab, okay?

18:26.804 --> 18:28.972
There you are.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.673
Yeah. I just...
Don't tell me

18:30.675 --> 18:31.892
you went to the
impound, too.

18:31.894 --> 18:33.343
No. Wait, did you?

18:33.345 --> 18:35.111
Yeah, turned out MEA's
quite thorough.

18:35.113 --> 18:38.114
They kicked me out of my own
lab for the past eight hours,

18:38.116 --> 18:41.017
so with no place else to go...
Did you look at Iris's car?

18:41.019 --> 18:43.737
No. I went to the impound to
check out last year's models.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.455
Okay, did you find anything?

18:45.457 --> 18:47.624
Some dandruff, some dirt

18:47.626 --> 18:48.875
and 13 different
sets of partials.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.526
That's a lot of people
in her car.

18:50.528 --> 18:52.028
Well, she worked
at a high-end club.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.197
She probably got
valet service.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.883
But you know Iris
confessed, right?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.385
She did <i>what?</i>

19:03.207 --> 19:04.591
(door opens)

19:04.593 --> 19:07.394
Iris, why did you confess?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.379
Tomorrow is arraignment.

19:09.381 --> 19:10.847
The lawyer says

19:10.849 --> 19:12.682
plea is best.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.684
Ten years instead of life.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.269
Ten years?!

19:16.271 --> 19:18.205
You're innocent.

19:21.776 --> 19:23.893
I found your sisters.

19:23.895 --> 19:27.080
I know about
Mila and Cena.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.065
What did you do with them?
They're safe.

19:29.067 --> 19:32.168
No one else in my department
knows about them.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.037
Mila was sick when I found her,

19:34.039 --> 19:36.906
but a doctor friend
is taking care of her.

19:39.377 --> 19:41.027
They're who you
were coming home to

19:41.029 --> 19:43.029
when the judge
was killed, right?

19:43.031 --> 19:46.349
They're your alibi,
but you can't tell anyone?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.185
If they come here,
they will be put back to Bosnia.

19:49.187 --> 19:51.137
Probably killed.

19:51.139 --> 19:53.256
There is no alibi.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.941
I did it.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.193
I know you didn't.

19:58.479 --> 20:02.282
But whoever did knew
you'd make a great suspect.

20:03.317 --> 20:06.436
Who knew about you
and Judge Hanson?

20:06.438 --> 20:08.405
That we were friends?

20:08.407 --> 20:11.124
Your coworkers thought it was
a little more than that.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.909
Who-- Dane?

20:12.911 --> 20:15.128
I never slept with the judge.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.579
I just make friends,

20:16.581 --> 20:19.499
trying to stop him from
deporting my brother.

20:19.501 --> 20:22.485
How'd you know
I was talking about Dane?

20:25.840 --> 20:29.175
We were together.

20:29.177 --> 20:33.263
I told him nothing was going on
with the judge,

20:33.265 --> 20:35.315
but he didn't believe me.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.635
He was very angry.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.803
You think he did this?

20:42.657 --> 20:44.824
Which means you didn't.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.242
(door opens)

20:48.779 --> 20:50.697
I need you.

20:50.699 --> 20:52.916
I have a signed confession
that's now tainted

20:52.918 --> 20:55.118
because a cop repeatedly spoke
to a perp

20:55.120 --> 20:56.486
behind the back of counsel.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.954
Iris was confused.

20:57.956 --> 21:00.707
Cat, is there something
that you're not telling us?

21:05.129 --> 21:07.430
I haven't found anything
definitive yet.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.215
This fishing expedition
ends here.

21:10.267 --> 21:12.168
You're home till further notice.

21:13.137 --> 21:14.771
Need your gun
and badge.

21:15.773 --> 21:17.724
And, Vargas,

21:17.726 --> 21:18.841
you knew about this, too?

21:18.843 --> 21:20.343
She didn't do
anything, Joe.

21:20.345 --> 21:21.895
Lieutenant.

21:21.897 --> 21:23.947
And she knew enough
about what you did.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.518
Desk duty, rest of the month.

21:29.737 --> 21:32.021
You're both
dismissed.

21:42.666 --> 21:44.867
Tess.

21:46.587 --> 21:49.539
I am so sorry.

21:50.891 --> 21:53.510
It's just, uh, Iris, she...

21:53.512 --> 21:55.595
You're still on this?

21:55.597 --> 21:57.213
Look, believe me,

21:57.215 --> 21:58.932
I wish Wilansky
got this wrong,

21:58.934 --> 22:01.484
but this is how it works
and these are the rules,

22:01.486 --> 22:03.520
so next time you decide
to take a swan dive

22:03.522 --> 22:06.222
off the cliff, don't forget,
you're dragging me with you.

22:06.224 --> 22:07.774
No, I know that, of course I do.

22:07.776 --> 22:09.576
Do you?

22:09.578 --> 22:12.278
'Cause I know you carry
a lot of baggage, Cat--

22:12.280 --> 22:13.863
questions about
your mom--

22:13.865 --> 22:16.366
and you disappear inside
yourself, and I get that,

22:16.368 --> 22:18.885
but lately you've
been off the rails--

22:18.887 --> 22:20.837
going to Iris's apartment
without telling me,

22:20.839 --> 22:22.622
going M.I.A.
for the night.

22:22.624 --> 22:26.926
I know for a fact that this
woman is innocent, Tess, I do.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.962
You're suspended and
I'm on desk duty.

22:28.964 --> 22:31.631
You need to drop this now.

22:44.423 --> 22:46.507
VINCENT: Hey.
(gasps)

22:46.509 --> 22:48.259
Shh.

22:48.261 --> 22:50.177
I didn't mean to scare you.
You are lucky

22:50.179 --> 22:51.762
I don't have my gun.

22:51.764 --> 22:52.763
What happened?

22:52.765 --> 22:54.265
Are the girls okay?

22:54.267 --> 22:56.267
The day of the hit-and-run,
the girls saw a man come

22:56.269 --> 22:58.636
into Iris's apartment
and take her keys.

22:58.638 --> 22:59.854
What?

22:59.856 --> 23:01.906
<i>They used Iris's car</i>
<i>to kill the judge?</i>

23:01.908 --> 23:03.941
VINCENT: <i>Yeah, they said</i>
<i>they couldn't see who he was</i>

23:03.943 --> 23:05.526
<i>through the vent,</i>
<i>but they said he had</i>

23:05.528 --> 23:07.311
a knife in his arm.

23:07.313 --> 23:09.981
Probably meant hand.

23:09.983 --> 23:11.599
I wonder if it was her boss.

23:11.601 --> 23:14.035
They were a couple, but
when I talked to him,

23:14.037 --> 23:16.487
he acted like she was
just another employee.

23:16.489 --> 23:18.406
In fact, he was
jealous of the judge.

23:18.408 --> 23:20.758
So you think he did this?
Yeah, but

23:20.760 --> 23:23.244
there's nothing I
can do about it.

23:23.246 --> 23:24.528
I'm suspended.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.213
I have no badge,
I have no gun.

23:26.215 --> 23:27.581
I can't even
get a warrant

23:27.583 --> 23:29.250
to find her keys,

23:29.252 --> 23:32.286
but I don't need one to
get into Dane's club.

23:32.288 --> 23:33.854
Maybe I could find
Iris's car keys.

23:33.856 --> 23:36.790
Wait, you're gonna go alone
without your partner?

23:36.792 --> 23:38.442
I'll be fine.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.597

25:10.886 --> 25:15.055
So it turns out
that you're Iris's ex-boyfriend.

25:15.057 --> 25:18.392
Any reason you
didn't mention that?

25:18.394 --> 25:20.744
Because I knew it would lead
to this kind of BS,

25:20.746 --> 25:24.415
which isn't exactly
great for business.

25:24.417 --> 25:25.666
I have two eyewitnesses

25:25.668 --> 25:27.734
that saw a man on Tuesday

25:27.736 --> 25:31.288
taking Iris's keys
out of her apartment.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.257
I'm betting
they'll recognize your face.

25:33.259 --> 25:35.242
The hell they will.

25:35.244 --> 25:36.794
I got 200 witnesses
that confirm

25:36.796 --> 25:38.679
I was here all day Tuesday.

25:40.882 --> 25:43.684
So why don't you
turn around?

25:43.686 --> 25:45.769
Let me watch you walk
that skinny little ass

25:45.771 --> 25:48.606

No, I'm not taking the fall.

Who was that
on the phone?!

26:32.318 --> 26:33.984
(alarm chirps)

26:33.986 --> 26:35.019
You just called
someone.

26:35.021 --> 26:37.354
Who was it?

26:39.107 --> 26:40.474
Oh, my God, oh,
my God, oh, God.

26:40.476 --> 26:41.575
He is fine.

26:41.577 --> 26:43.344
He does not
look fine.

26:43.346 --> 26:44.778
What are you doing here?

26:44.780 --> 26:46.647
You said you didn't have a gun.

26:46.649 --> 26:47.814
I also said

26:47.816 --> 26:50.367
that I would take
it from here.

26:50.369 --> 26:52.169
Look, he called someone after
you left his office, okay?

26:52.171 --> 26:53.621
It was
about the girls.

26:53.623 --> 26:55.656
It sounded like it was
to whoever did this.

26:55.658 --> 26:58.209
So you thought you would beat
the information out of him?

26:58.211 --> 27:00.327
This, this is why
I don't get involved.

27:00.329 --> 27:03.330
You're right, I shouldn't
have asked you,

27:03.332 --> 27:05.633
but you're the one
who left me the note.

27:05.635 --> 27:07.501
So, what are you saying,
that I shouldn't have?

27:07.503 --> 27:09.053
No, I just...

27:09.055 --> 27:11.639
I can't figure out how
this is supposed to work.

27:11.641 --> 27:14.525
I can't go to your
loft, but you can

27:14.527 --> 27:16.009
just show up at my work.

27:16.011 --> 27:18.028
I can't call you, but JT
has your phone number.

27:18.030 --> 27:21.365
It's a burner
for emergencies.

27:21.367 --> 27:23.817
Oh, my God.

27:23.819 --> 27:25.035
Tess was right.

27:25.037 --> 27:28.789
I have swan dived so
far off the cliff.

27:28.791 --> 27:29.990
This guy is
unconscious.

27:29.992 --> 27:31.492
I said he would be fine.
And it is

27:31.494 --> 27:34.662
all on your terms,

27:34.664 --> 27:36.530
which means I'm
alone in it.

27:36.532 --> 27:39.133
Yeah, well, join the club.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.764
VINCENT: <i>Yeah, they said</i>
<i>they couldn't see who he was</i>

27:53.766 --> 27:57.434
through the vent, but they said
<i>he had a knife in his arm.</i>

27:57.436 --> 27:58.969
He was murdered?

28:01.889 --> 28:03.440
Look.

28:05.910 --> 28:08.862
Thank you for the
medical consult.

28:08.864 --> 28:11.031
Truly you saved
that girl's life,

28:11.033 --> 28:13.784
but I've got to go by the
book to see this through.

28:14.619 --> 28:17.087
I will take it from here.

28:23.962 --> 28:26.130
(phone ringing)

28:37.091 --> 28:39.259
(groaning)

28:54.062 --> 28:56.146
First of all,
I am sorry.

28:57.682 --> 29:00.260
I will never treat you
like a non-partner again.

29:00.262 --> 29:01.845
You could ditch
me for a week

29:01.847 --> 29:03.313
and still be the best
partner I ever had.

29:03.315 --> 29:05.015
All right,
what's going on?

29:05.017 --> 29:07.901
Okay, you remember how Iris--
she didn't seem

29:07.903 --> 29:10.354
like she knew anything about
the judge being murdered?

29:10.356 --> 29:11.855
That's because
she didn't.

29:11.857 --> 29:13.991
She was going home to see
her two little sisters.

29:13.993 --> 29:15.692
Why didn't she
just say so?

29:15.694 --> 29:18.195
They're here illegally,
she's got them in hiding.

29:18.197 --> 29:19.446
She thinks
they're gonna get deported

29:19.448 --> 29:21.031
just like her brother did,

29:21.033 --> 29:24.901
and I think that they were
smuggled here by Sam.

29:24.903 --> 29:26.770
Bartender guy?
Yeah,

29:26.772 --> 29:28.622
and apparently coyote guy.

29:28.624 --> 29:30.357
In '09
he was brought up

29:30.359 --> 29:35.178
on charges of smuggling people
in from Eastern Europe.

29:35.180 --> 29:37.080
Guess who
the presiding judge was.

29:37.082 --> 29:38.248
Hanson.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.083
So this was some
kind of retribution?

29:40.085 --> 29:42.752
More like insurance.

29:43.554 --> 29:45.856
So Sam panics.

29:45.858 --> 29:49.426
He sees Iris cozying up to the
judge who almost put him away.

29:49.428 --> 29:51.561
He gets nervous that
she's giving him up

29:51.563 --> 29:55.065
in order to get favorable
treatment for her family,

29:55.067 --> 29:58.235
so he wants to
shut them both up.

29:58.237 --> 30:01.855
He kills the judge
and he frames Iris.

30:01.857 --> 30:04.458
And we prove this how?

30:04.460 --> 30:07.961
Sam's nasty bar spittoon.

30:07.963 --> 30:10.213
I snagged it from
the club tonight.

30:10.215 --> 30:12.883
I'm banking that Evan will
find DNA that matches

30:12.885 --> 30:15.636
one of the DNA samples
found in the car. (phone ringing)

30:15.638 --> 30:17.620
Oh. Our warrant's working.

30:17.622 --> 30:19.122
This is Vargas.

30:19.124 --> 30:22.142
We've got the location
of Sam's phone.

30:22.144 --> 30:25.345
123rd. He's at Iris's apartment.
He's going after the girls.

30:25.347 --> 30:27.764
We have to tell Joe.

30:42.163 --> 30:45.332
(soft breathing)

31:04.469 --> 31:07.888
(creaking)

31:33.697 --> 31:35.332
(yells)

31:35.800 --> 31:36.550
What the...?

31:36.552 --> 31:39.603
(muffled yelling)

31:50.681 --> 31:52.566
What the hell is going on?
I thought she was suspended.

31:52.568 --> 31:54.735
Well, looks like you took down
the wrong perp, Wilansky.

31:54.737 --> 31:56.653
All right, Unit One Charlie.

31:56.655 --> 31:58.688
One Charlie. Looking for?
White male

31:58.690 --> 32:00.941
mid-20s, medium build,
brown hair.

32:00.943 --> 32:02.692
Presumed armed,
definitely dangerous.

32:02.694 --> 32:04.861
He might have two little girls as hostages.
All right,

32:04.863 --> 32:06.329
let's move. Move.

32:06.331 --> 32:08.532
And remember the knife
tattoo on his arm.

32:08.534 --> 32:10.584
Move.
Go, go, go.

32:10.586 --> 32:12.586
You better be right.

32:12.588 --> 32:15.122
(phone ringing)

32:18.092 --> 32:19.209
Chandler.

32:19.211 --> 32:21.178
Hey. It's me.

32:21.180 --> 32:22.629
I got the guy who did this.
What?

32:22.631 --> 32:23.597
Don't worry,

32:23.599 --> 32:24.881
he's conscious, okay?

32:24.883 --> 32:26.500
I'll hold him till you get here.

32:26.502 --> 32:27.601
Where are you?

32:27.603 --> 32:28.685
I'm at Iris's.

32:28.687 --> 32:29.886
JT has the girls.

32:29.888 --> 32:31.354
Okay. We're already here.

32:31.356 --> 32:33.607
You need to get out <i>now.</i>

32:33.609 --> 32:35.758
(footsteps)

32:36.227 --> 32:38.395
Go, go, go!

32:38.397 --> 32:39.446
(panting)

32:39.448 --> 32:41.648
(siren wails)

32:42.600 --> 32:44.451
Go left!

32:46.103 --> 32:49.289
(police speaking indistinctly)

32:55.580 --> 32:56.713
Clear!

(siren chirps)

32:58.634 --> 33:00.467
(panting)

33:00.469 --> 33:02.552
Hey, this place
is empty. What's up?

33:02.554 --> 33:05.255
They must have heard us. They're
somewhere in the building.

33:05.257 --> 33:07.557
All right, fan out!
Let's go, let's go!

33:07.559 --> 33:09.643
Let's sweep the rest
of the building!

33:09.645 --> 33:12.179

CATHERINE (panting):
Stop!

33:30.415 --> 33:31.748
He's out, he didn't see you!

33:31.750 --> 33:33.283
Vincent, stop!

33:33.285 --> 33:35.335
We need him alive.
I prove that he's guilty,

33:35.337 --> 33:37.838
Iris goes free.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.039
Stop.

33:39.041 --> 33:40.457
Vincent.

33:40.459 --> 33:43.877
Vincent, those girls
are okay because of you.

33:44.962 --> 33:48.715
You saved a child's
life yesterday.

34:01.229 --> 34:02.863
WILANSKY:
<i>What the hell?</i>

34:02.865 --> 34:04.447
How'd you disappear
and suddenly have the guy?

34:04.449 --> 34:06.366
That's female
energy for you.

34:10.905 --> 34:14.090
(engine starts)

34:18.226 --> 34:19.409
We placed the perp
<i>in Iris's car</i>

34:19.411 --> 34:20.527
at the time of impact

34:20.529 --> 34:22.395
thanks to DNA material,

34:22.397 --> 34:23.897
which you asked Evan to test,

34:23.899 --> 34:25.364
even though it wasn't your case.

34:25.851 --> 34:28.103
We were backup.
Which turned out to be

34:28.105 --> 34:29.603
chewing tobacco,

34:29.606 --> 34:31.272
which matched the chewing
tobacco that you stole

34:31.274 --> 34:32.607
from a club
that you entered

34:32.609 --> 34:34.891
without a warrant or a badge.
Okay,

34:34.893 --> 34:36.661
but on the other hand,
we tracked Sam

34:36.663 --> 34:39.110
to Iris's apartment
with an actual warrant...

34:39.135 --> 34:39.831
Hold on.

34:39.833 --> 34:41.032
And based on protocol,

34:41.034 --> 34:42.033
with these infractions,

34:42.034 --> 34:43.234
she should be demoted...

34:43.235 --> 34:44.652
to garbage.

34:44.654 --> 34:45.851
Is that code for something?

34:45.853 --> 34:47.518
It's code for garbage.

34:47.521 --> 34:49.237
Come on, Joe,
she broke the case.

34:50.029 --> 34:52.530
She broke a lot of
rules, but on behalf of

34:52.532 --> 34:54.966
my friend Judge Hanson...

34:54.967 --> 34:56.817
I'm glad you did.

34:56.819 --> 34:59.286
But as head

34:59.288 --> 35:00.521
of this department, rule is...

35:00.523 --> 35:02.373
I got to give you desk duty.

35:04.827 --> 35:06.878
One week.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.367
(softly):
Nice work.

35:14.418 --> 35:16.386
I spoke with a caseworker
at the State Department.

35:16.388 --> 35:18.605
I explained to them that
your sisters are key witnesses

35:18.607 --> 35:20.474
in a high-profile prosecution.

35:20.476 --> 35:22.692
He thinks
we can get them asylum.

35:22.694 --> 35:26.696
I didn't want to expose
them, Iris, truly, but...

35:26.698 --> 35:29.116
I didn't have a choice.

35:30.201 --> 35:32.069
You saved their lives.

35:32.071 --> 35:33.603

35:50.923 --> 35:52.172
Are you celebrating?

35:52.174 --> 35:54.391
I believe I am,
if drinking to excess

35:54.393 --> 35:57.727
in the privacy of my lab
qualifies as a celebration.

35:57.729 --> 35:58.845

35:58.847 --> 35:59.930
Everything was in order.

35:59.932 --> 36:01.598
No demerits.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.300
Inspector Man barely made eye
contact with me as he left

36:04.302 --> 36:05.685
the door.

36:05.687 --> 36:07.404
You know, I didn't think
I was nervous,

36:17.983 --> 36:19.983

36:34.619 --> 36:37.955
I went to the morgue.
The samples were there.

36:37.957 --> 36:41.225
Just as you suspected.

36:41.227 --> 36:43.961
We'll understand more once
these are analyzed, but...

36:43.963 --> 36:45.212
it's now confirmed--

36:45.214 --> 36:47.664
Vincent Keller
is very much alive.

36:47.666 --> 36:51.668
And Catherine Chandler
is going to bring him to us.

That little one was funny.

(chuckles)

37:34.046 --> 37:36.230
It felt good, you know.

37:36.232 --> 37:37.381
Helping.

37:37.383 --> 37:38.666
Worth the risk?

37:39.165 --> 37:40.981
Yeah.

37:40.983 --> 37:43.123
Although, uh, JT is
developing an ulcer.

37:43.124 --> 37:45.791
Well, luckily,
you can treat that.

37:48.183 --> 37:52.519

unrealistic expectations.

communicate or be
in the outside world.

38:08.782 --> 38:12.784
Okay. What I am trying
to say, badly, is that...

38:14.786 --> 38:17.237
I get it.

38:17.239 --> 38:18.788
In order to be in contact
with you,

38:18.790 --> 38:22.626
it has to be on your terms.

38:22.629 --> 38:24.812
It's just...

38:24.814 --> 38:26.547
you know, it's hard.

38:26.549 --> 38:29.267
But I'd like to make it work.

38:30.385 --> 38:32.803
Then maybe we need
to revise the terms.

38:32.805 --> 38:34.088
Just in case.

38:34.090 --> 38:36.257
You want to help again.

38:36.259 --> 38:38.359
Okay, here's one:

38:38.361 --> 38:41.595
a week can't go by
without one of us reaching out

38:41.597 --> 38:43.981
to say, "I'm still alive."

38:43.983 --> 38:45.432
Fine.

38:45.434 --> 38:47.068
But my place?

38:47.070 --> 38:48.903
You can't go there.

38:48.905 --> 38:51.539
Unless it is a dire emergency.

38:51.541 --> 38:56.127
How am I supposed to know what
qualifies as a dire emergency?

38:56.129 --> 38:58.879
You call me and you ask.

39:02.117 --> 39:04.268
(chuckles)
Don't get too excited.

39:04.270 --> 39:07.255
It's only good
for three more days.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.472

39:08.474 --> 39:09.957
