02:05.625 --> 02:10.630
-It's a tractor!
-Look, a tractor!

02:31.317 --> 02:32.902
Don't stay here. Go over there.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.005
I told you to go over there.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.099
1986, OCTOBER 23RD

03:16.196 --> 03:17.197
Go home.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.156
Go home.

03:18.990 --> 03:19.991
Prick.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.242
-Prick.
-I found it.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.452
I found it.

03:22.535 --> 03:23.828
-Look!
-What's all that?

03:23.912 --> 03:25.496
-What's all that?
-I found it!

03:25.580 --> 03:27.165
-Hey!
-Hey!

03:27.248 --> 03:29.042
-Put that back!
-Put that back!

03:31.961 --> 03:33.671
Put it down.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.506
-Put it down and leave.
-It's mine.

03:35.590 --> 03:36.883
-Hey!
-Hey!

03:36.966 --> 03:38.718
That's important. Don't touch that!

03:38.801 --> 03:40.553
That's important. Don't touch that!

03:41.721 --> 03:42.680
Those pricks.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.432
Those pricks.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.477
You annoying pricks!

04:27.350 --> 04:28.184
See?

04:29.227 --> 04:31.854
You dated and got dumped
by the dead Park Bo-hee.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.314
Yes or no?

04:34.774 --> 04:35.692
Seems about right.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.277
Seems about right?

04:37.944 --> 04:40.071
Take that hat off, you son of a bitch.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.284
What girl would like you for that?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.161
After. Watching.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.999
Bo. Dy. Heat.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.625
The. Film.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.002
Body heat?

04:54.085 --> 04:55.253
Is that an action film?

04:56.754 --> 04:58.756
Ac… Act…

05:06.139 --> 05:07.890
You, jackass.

05:07.974 --> 05:13.104
As the case concerns murder of women,
please understand my wording.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.106
For example.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.150
Sexy.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.776
Or pretty.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.278
Impressions like these?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.362
So first impression?

05:22.613 --> 05:23.698
Well, I guess

05:24.949 --> 05:27.243
sophisticated
despite being from the country…

05:29.203 --> 05:30.121
Open your eyes.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.042
You closed your eyes.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.627
Look at me.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.132
Not the sky. Look at me!

05:42.884 --> 05:44.635
Are his eyes naturally like that?

05:44.719 --> 05:46.512
One, two.

05:50.975 --> 05:55.646
<i>…about a middle-aged woman</i>
<i>and the two children.</i>

05:55.730 --> 05:56.564
<i>Their stories…</i>

05:56.647 --> 05:57.982
LIM CHEOL-MIN (26)
ROBBERY, RAPE

05:58.649 --> 06:01.319
Didn't you say you were going
to the military academy?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.195
FAST DELIVERY

06:02.236 --> 06:04.030
Did you take the test for it?

06:04.614 --> 06:07.367
You better study hard
to go to the military academy.

06:10.078 --> 06:10.953
Receipt.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.538
You didn't tell us.

06:12.622 --> 06:17.460
Stop pulling my leg.
I told you to bring the receipt.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.669
No, you didn't.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.632
-You said that the last time so I--
-Hey, hey!

06:22.715 --> 06:24.467
Detective Park.

06:24.550 --> 06:29.013
Jackass, stop lying.
You answered the call.

06:29.097 --> 06:33.267
I need the receipt for the meal,
not the bicycle.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.852
Hey, the receipt!

06:45.113 --> 06:47.240
Why haven't you set up the lines?

06:47.323 --> 06:50.993
Use a tool, not your hands!

06:51.077 --> 06:53.454
-They can't do shit.
-This way, Detective Park.

06:54.705 --> 06:55.540
What's this?

06:55.623 --> 06:56.457
Footprint, sir.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.084
How'd you find it?

06:58.167 --> 07:00.294
By me. I found it this morning.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.213
Go help out that kid.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.589
Man.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.882
Called the forensics?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.843
Yes, they'll be here momentarily.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.972
You know what?
We don't have the informant at the scene.

07:11.055 --> 07:11.931
What?

07:12.640 --> 07:16.686
No forensics yet either.
The scene's a mess!

07:17.145 --> 07:18.938
That gaffer.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.898
-Dal-su!
-Let's go!

07:20.982 --> 07:22.984
-You pricks! Go away!
-Dal-su!

07:23.943 --> 07:25.445
Hey, get rid of the kids!

07:25.528 --> 07:26.654
Come over here.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.614
Who got the call?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.450
You couldn't find the informant?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.576
The call--

07:31.659 --> 07:33.202
We can't preserve it this way.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.247
Forensics aren't here either.
What a shithole.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.916
-Park Seung-gyu?
-What does this even mean?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.002
-Photos!
-What happened here?

07:41.085 --> 07:43.004
Take the photos when instructed!

07:43.087 --> 07:46.048
Why'd you let the reporters in?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.676
They were already here when I arrived.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.136
What? Man.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.722
I don't see Reporter Park though.
A day off?

07:52.805 --> 07:54.307
I'm not sure either.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.725
Hate that dickface.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.604
What a way to end my career.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.440
I need a preserved scene
to begin investigating.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.817
-Hey, tractor!
-Preserve it well!

08:04.901 --> 08:07.862
-Hey, tractor!
-Do it well!

08:09.530 --> 08:11.073
Get outta here, tractor!

08:11.157 --> 08:14.785
No, not there! Tractor!

08:14.869 --> 08:15.703
Hey!

08:18.164 --> 08:20.166
Don't you see me waving here!

08:20.249 --> 08:23.503
What you got stuck up
your fucking ear hole!

08:23.586 --> 08:26.047
You dickhead! Don't you see this?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.341
Assholes are finally here.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.718
Tell the people there to go away!

08:30.801 --> 08:33.513
I called you to come ages ago!

08:33.596 --> 08:34.430
Huh?

08:34.514 --> 08:38.643
I can't get shit started
until you preserve the scene!

08:39.310 --> 08:41.395
Got honey on the field?
He fucking ate it too.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.481
Seriously, what's going on here?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.906
Why do you keep staring at the pictures?

08:51.989 --> 08:53.741
Doesn't it kill your appetite?

08:53.824 --> 08:55.117
It's sick.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.912
If I stare at it long enough

08:57.995 --> 09:00.623
I can tell who the perp is.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.958
Instinctively.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.795
What are you, a psychic?
Why not consider a change of career?

09:06.420 --> 09:07.338
Sheesh.

09:08.005 --> 09:11.634
I have a knack for seeing through people.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.012
That's how I make my living

09:15.096 --> 09:19.225
and the reason they call me
the all-seeing eye around here.

09:20.268 --> 09:24.313
If that's the case,
you see those two sitting over there?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.944
One of the two is a rapist

09:30.027 --> 09:32.572
and the other
is the brother of the victim.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.491
So the brother brought in

09:35.575 --> 09:39.912
the perp who did his sister.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.585
Now let's see

09:45.668 --> 09:48.629
if you can guess which one the rapist is.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.312
It's not in.

10:04.895 --> 10:05.730
Really?

10:05.813 --> 10:07.815
Do it properly, will you?

10:13.154 --> 10:16.115
I'll personally give you
a special shot today.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.491
What an honor.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.204
It's only a cold shot.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.290
Do you know how much this costs?

10:27.209 --> 10:28.502
Gwak Seol-young.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.420
Yeah?

10:29.920 --> 10:33.132
I hear you're doing better now
than when you were at the clinic.

10:35.843 --> 10:39.221
When people get sick here,
they come to you, not the doctor.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.641
Wait, I have something important to say.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.811
I heard it while giving a shot
to the granny at the mill.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.857
You know "Baek's Meat Shop"
in Jeongsol-myeon?

10:51.108 --> 10:51.942
Baek's?

10:53.027 --> 10:55.613
You know what kind of a Baek he is?

10:56.572 --> 10:57.406
What?

10:58.741 --> 11:00.743
He's a "gonna-jump-on-ya" Baek.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.412
Jump on women?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.622
Exactly.

11:05.331 --> 11:09.960
Well, they've got a crazy son
called Baek Gwang-ho.

11:11.796 --> 11:16.175
Apparently,
he used to chase after Lee Hyang-suk.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.677
Lee Hyang-suk.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.261
The dead Lee Hyang-suk?

11:20.054 --> 11:20.888
Yes.

11:21.889 --> 11:26.310
The woman who died
with a girdle over her head last winter.

11:26.977 --> 11:27.812
Right.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.564
Even more importantly

11:31.482 --> 11:33.484
the night Lee Hyang-suk got killed

11:34.527 --> 11:38.155
the granny saw him stalking her.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.325
She really saw it?

11:41.909 --> 11:42.743
I'm telling you.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.372
There're rumors
she's been loopy since last year.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.332
She's perfectly fine.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.882
The son. Let's see.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.469
Baek Gwang-ho?
What does he look like again?

12:01.178 --> 12:06.100
This side of his face is a bit…

12:07.017 --> 12:08.477
Gimme some details.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.814
Anyway, he's not all that well.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.924
Hey, Baek Gwang-ho.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.594
Just between us guys

12:41.677 --> 12:44.805
When you see a pretty girl,
you get the feels and want some.

12:45.556 --> 12:49.435
Believe me, I used to do that
with my friends when I was your age.

12:49.518 --> 12:50.895
I feel ya.

12:51.562 --> 12:57.109
You weren't trying to kill her
from the get-go.

12:57.693 --> 13:01.113
-You probably wanted to touch her boobs--
-I couldn't.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.865
That's why you killed her.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.533
To touch her when she's dead.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.576
No.

13:07.077 --> 13:07.995
You know.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.709
I grew up like you, with hardships.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.169
Yet I'm a nice person.

13:15.795 --> 13:20.257
A man's got a lot of affection
and can be impatient

13:20.341 --> 13:23.302
which sometimes lead to these things
but it's not a fault.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.387
But hitting someone with a fist--

13:30.559 --> 13:34.522
You've got a hell of a face.

13:34.605 --> 13:38.943
Just looking at his face makes me mad.

13:40.903 --> 13:41.737
What now?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.990
-Oh no.
-It's scraped.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.620
This kid.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.042
Purdy, huh?

13:55.960 --> 13:59.255
This is so you don't get scrapes, asshole.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.548
Hey.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.133
Stop that with your boots.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.845
You're hurting the kid.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.222
Baek Gwang-ho. Get up.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.643
Asshole.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.603
You're really not guilty?

14:15.771 --> 14:17.356
Look at me in the eyes.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.316
Huh?

14:19.733 --> 14:21.360
Can't tell where he's looking.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.653
Look at me in the eyes!

14:41.463 --> 14:45.926
If you don't turn yourself in,
your limbs will rot to death.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.193
Excuse me, is there…

15:04.153 --> 15:05.362
Is there--

15:07.573 --> 15:08.407
Miss!

15:08.908 --> 15:10.826
Are you okay?

15:11.452 --> 15:12.536
What are you doing?

15:12.620 --> 15:15.831
I was just trying to ask for direction.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.541
-Here, let me help you up.
-Hey!

15:17.625 --> 15:18.459
Hey!

15:21.128 --> 15:22.129
-I'm--
-Here, get up.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.632
-What are you--
-It's freaking daytime.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.759
-Miss.
-Where do you think this is?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.135
The Rape Kingdom?

15:28.218 --> 15:30.596
Son of a bitch.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.889
-Get over here.
-Hey!

15:35.100 --> 15:37.186
Who the hell are you, you jackass?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.021
What are you?

15:41.899 --> 15:42.816
Get out here!

15:43.525 --> 15:46.779
-Fuck!
-Miss, the victim needs to accompany!

15:49.031 --> 15:50.240
-Hey!
-Miss!

15:50.324 --> 15:52.368
-Stop!
-Bastard.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.287
Hey! Fuck!

16:00.084 --> 16:02.544
-Shit. She left.
-Hey!

16:02.628 --> 16:03.629
Are you a cop?

16:07.591 --> 16:09.593
You should've told me sooner.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.470
My bad.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.391
You're terrible at fighting
for being a cop.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.147
You're terrible at recognizing people
for being a cop.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.195
What's this smell?

16:29.029 --> 16:30.155
Oh, sneakers.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.366
Stinks, doesn't it?

16:32.449 --> 16:36.495
May not look it,
but that's actually evidence no. 28.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.773
Get this developed quickly.

17:07.776 --> 17:08.819
Sergeant.

17:08.902 --> 17:09.778
What?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.321
He's from Seoul--

17:11.405 --> 17:14.283
Oh, nice to see you!

17:14.366 --> 17:15.701
I got the call.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.163
What happened to your face?

17:20.247 --> 17:22.124
Did something happen?

17:23.083 --> 17:23.917
It's nothing.

17:24.001 --> 17:24.835
So the desk.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.503
-Sergeant, the desk?
-Oh, right.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.589
I got you a seat by the window.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.215
Oh there.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.426
I like the corner over there.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.181
Okay, sure! Whatever you want.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.186
-Detective Jo, say hello.
-Yeah?

17:43.937 --> 17:48.317
Senior officer Seo Tae-yun
from the Seoul office.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.359
-Oh, I see.
-Yea.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.361
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.

17:51.445 --> 17:55.115
He volunteered for this case.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.743
What an extraordinary opportunity.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.704
Go ahead and get settled.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.122
Please.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.584
Reality Show
<i>Inspector Sergeant</i>

18:18.055 --> 18:20.808
I like that song. That theme song.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.769
I need to go home
to watch <i>Inspector Sergeant.</i>

18:23.852 --> 18:25.687
Which episode was tonight again?

18:26.605 --> 18:27.773
Hey, eat.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.567
Right, I need to call Dad.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.485
I said, eat!

18:31.568 --> 18:33.112
I need to call--
It's Dad!

18:37.407 --> 18:38.951
Is it out? Come on.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.665
Hey, Baek Gwang-ho.

18:47.459 --> 18:53.048
This is the footprint taken
from the scene of death last year.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.216
Take a good look.

18:54.883 --> 18:58.428
And this is your sneakers from your place.
You wear them, right?

18:58.929 --> 18:59.763
Yes or no?

19:01.014 --> 19:02.141
Okay, look.

19:02.891 --> 19:07.855
Look at the footprint in the picture
and the bottom of your shoes. Well?

19:09.064 --> 19:10.023
Exact match, right?

19:10.524 --> 19:11.817
This pattern.

19:12.568 --> 19:17.281
Round. Sunken. Exactly the same, huh?

19:18.323 --> 19:19.324
Yes or no?

19:20.576 --> 19:23.495
That's just dirt that got wiped out

19:23.579 --> 19:24.830
so no matter, right?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.544
You killed all the women, right?

19:32.880 --> 19:33.714
Fine.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.301
You didn't kill all of them.

19:38.010 --> 19:38.844
Right?

19:41.513 --> 19:44.600
But you didn't not kill
Lee Hyang-suk alone.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.560
Well?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.312
I didn't kill anyone.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.354
Hey!

19:49.938 --> 19:52.900
We have all the evidence. Stop lying!

19:53.734 --> 19:55.819
-Where's our shovel?
-A shovel?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.990
You're a joke.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.327
-Hey, asshole.
-Yes?

20:03.410 --> 20:04.995
Lemme see that.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.457
What kind of a guy
doesn't even know how to shovel?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.752
You get it set up
and step on it, like this.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.837
-Baek Gwang-ho.
-Yes?

20:13.921 --> 20:16.798
-And then you scoop it up, like this.
-This moron.

20:16.882 --> 20:17.799
-Like this.
-Whoa.

20:17.883 --> 20:21.511
You think we're here to play?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.931
You know what this is?

20:24.014 --> 20:26.266
We're gonna bury you here.

20:27.017 --> 20:27.851
Why?

20:27.935 --> 20:29.269
You ask why?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.772
'Cause you won't listen.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.190
I do listen.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.275
Then tell us.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.612
We've got fresh air,
despite your unfortunate face.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.114
Come over here.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.159
Girls don't like your face, do they?

20:45.035 --> 20:47.537
Shit, they frown and run away, don't they?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.497
That's right.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.582
I'm gonna kill them all.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.214
Everyone who frowned at my face.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.800
Kill them all.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.887
Everyone who frowned at my face.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.931
They're all in my head.

21:08.475 --> 21:09.810
Was Hyang-suk one of them?

21:09.893 --> 21:11.019
Hyang-suk?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.020
Lee Hyang-suk.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.231
You used to chase her around.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.232
She's pretty.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.775
Sure, she's pretty.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.696
But then she frowned at your face,
didn't she?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.572
She told you to get the fuck away.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.075
You liked her but that fucking bitch.

21:25.909 --> 21:26.827
So you killed her.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.539
Right?

21:36.003 --> 21:37.296
Next to the railroad.

21:37.838 --> 21:38.797
In the big field.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.633
Yes, that's right.

21:42.342 --> 21:45.262
Neck, Hyang-suk's neck.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.349
Strangled really hard.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.059
Using what?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.936
-The bra.
-Bra?

21:53.020 --> 21:55.022
Hyang-suk's white bra.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.484
Strangled the neck really hard.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.402
And then?

22:00.485 --> 22:01.445
Stockings.

22:01.528 --> 22:02.362
Stockings.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.156
Stockings taken off her.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.991
-So second is stockings.
-Yes.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.285
Kid's got some memory. He's smart.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.287
And then?

22:10.370 --> 22:11.371
What was that?

22:12.205 --> 22:14.207
What's that called?

22:15.792 --> 22:16.918
Like a string.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.671
Handbag strap?

22:19.755 --> 22:21.048
Yes, handbag strap!

22:21.757 --> 22:24.676
Using that on her neck

22:26.720 --> 22:28.722
to strangle really hard.

22:31.058 --> 22:31.892
And then?

22:32.893 --> 22:38.273
Then her body shivered

22:38.357 --> 22:40.776
and it looked
like she was completely dead.

22:42.110 --> 22:42.986
Then what?

22:45.197 --> 22:48.784
Pulled it over Hyang-suk's head.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.244
Pulled what over?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.455
Her panties.

22:53.538 --> 22:58.794
Her panties were pulled over her head,
like a hat.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.005
You mean a girdle?

23:02.089 --> 23:03.215
For women?

23:03.298 --> 23:05.258
Yes, girdle!

23:05.342 --> 23:10.013
-Put that on like a hat.
-Yeah.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.265
And then?

23:13.141 --> 23:15.143
Oh, put back on her clothes.

23:16.937 --> 23:17.854
Why was that?

23:18.980 --> 23:20.982
I don't know. Put it back on her.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.527
Why'd you do that? Why?

23:29.658 --> 23:30.784
I wouldn't know.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.994
Asshole! You've been doing great!

23:33.078 --> 23:35.080
You jackass, what did you do next?

23:35.163 --> 23:36.832
-Running!
-Okay, to where?

23:36.915 --> 23:38.625
-It was raining lots!
-Run where?

23:38.708 --> 23:40.919
-Kept running!
-You asshole!

23:41.002 --> 23:42.587
Where'd you run to?

23:42.671 --> 23:44.756
Lots of lightning! Boom!

23:45.590 --> 23:47.884
Tell us where you ran to!

23:47.968 --> 23:50.804
-Yong-gu! Dig again.
-Boom!

23:50.887 --> 23:54.015
-Dig? But we gotta…
-Lightning! Hot!

23:57.686 --> 23:58.520

<i>The air-raid alert has been issued.</i>

24:22.294 --> 24:24.546
<i>This is a drill.</i>

24:24.629 --> 24:29.426

<i>the air-raid alert is issued nation-wide.</i>

24:29.509 --> 24:32.679
<i>All public and private buildings and home</i>s

24:55.243 --> 24:57.245
Turn off the lights!

24:58.955 --> 25:00.373
Turn off the lights!

25:01.416 --> 25:04.753
-Turn off the lights!
-Hey, go home!

25:04.836 --> 25:06.838
Rice store, turn off the lights!

25:07.506 --> 25:09.341
Turn off the lights!

25:09.424 --> 25:11.426

25:17.015 --> 25:19.684
-What?
-Go put on some breasts.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.561
Hey, you!

25:22.729 --> 25:23.772
Over here.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.110
Put it on. Did you gather everyone?

25:29.194 --> 25:30.904
-Yes.
-Get in the car.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.863
LEE HYANG-SUK

25:31.905 --> 25:32.739
Turn around.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.619
Your pants. Go take those off.

25:39.996 --> 25:41.456
What should the headline say?

25:41.540 --> 25:45.210
How about "the three arrest-eteers"
or "the smile of the invincible trio"?

25:45.293 --> 25:47.420
-Detective Park, to the back.
-Hurry!

25:47.504 --> 25:49.714
First, form a row along the rail.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.007
That looks good.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.426
Ms. Gwon, it's a dinner party tonight!

25:53.510 --> 25:55.470
Okay, here we go!

25:55.554 --> 25:58.431
Okay, now with your fists!

25:58.515 --> 26:01.601
-Show me your fist! Great!
-Fist?

26:01.685 --> 26:04.437
-High in the air!
-Detective Seo, get in!

26:04.521 --> 26:06.606
-No thanks.
-Come on!

26:06.690 --> 26:08.692
Sergeant Gu, try this!

26:09.526 --> 26:11.945
-Okay, take one like this.
-Great!

26:12.028 --> 26:13.280
Hey, stand right there.

26:14.447 --> 26:15.282
Here.

26:22.163 --> 26:26.293
Your fingers are all stuck together.
Must be hard to use chopsticks.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.962
Since you were a kid, right?

26:32.966 --> 26:34.050
-Take him.
-Yes, sir.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.474
-Gwang-ho, it's here, right?
-Huh?

26:41.558 --> 26:42.392
I don't know.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.102
What you talking about?

26:44.185 --> 26:46.271
-It's here!
-Hey, quiet.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.899
Spot inspection is all about acting.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.985
We've got a lot of eyes on us.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.903
You got it?

26:53.987 --> 26:54.946
How's my position?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.740
Bend down more.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.074
What do we do first?

26:58.158 --> 27:00.827
What was it? Stockings.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.912
Ideally, we should have a numbered list.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.497
First, second, and so on.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.958
So why didn't you make one?
I'm fucking busy.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.084
Sergeant.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.377
What?

27:09.461 --> 27:12.172
It's too late
to have a proper spot inspection.

27:13.632 --> 27:17.218
-Cancel it to save more embarrassment.
-Hey, look.

27:17.761 --> 27:21.389
Didn't I tell you to stay away?
Why come all the way just to nag?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.351
Come up with any excuse.
"The suspect is sick" or--

27:24.434 --> 27:25.268
Detective Seo!

27:26.895 --> 27:30.190
Why're you trying to ruin a done-deal?

27:30.273 --> 27:33.276
I kept telling you that he's not the perp!

27:33.360 --> 27:34.402
Be quiet!

27:35.195 --> 27:36.363
Look, Sergeant.

27:36.446 --> 27:41.326
The perp tied her neck thrice
and made a tight knot.

27:41.409 --> 27:44.579
Have you seen his hands?
He can't tie anything with those hands!

27:44.663 --> 27:46.873
-Get out.
-Even little kids know that much!

27:46.956 --> 27:48.249
Get out!

27:50.669 --> 27:52.671
Grab the bra and tie it.
Concentrate!

27:52.754 --> 27:57.133
-Gwang-ho!
-It's Dad. Dad!

27:57.217 --> 27:58.718
It's Dad!

27:58.802 --> 28:00.136
Dad!

28:00.220 --> 28:03.431
You didn't do it! You didn't kill her!

28:03.515 --> 28:05.809
I know! I didn't do it!

28:05.892 --> 28:07.894
Were you at the scene? Tell me!

28:10.855 --> 28:12.607
He didn't kill them!

28:12.691 --> 28:14.818
My son's innocent!

28:37.340 --> 28:38.258
It's all over.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.260
Don't say a word.

28:41.803 --> 28:42.637
Hey.

28:43.096 --> 28:46.641
Did you see the face
of prosecutor Choi Hong-il earlier?

28:47.600 --> 28:50.437
Still, a fucking warrant dismissal?

28:51.312 --> 28:52.856
We have real evidence.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.275
You mean the picture of the footprint?

28:58.111 --> 29:00.488
Are we really letting him loose?

29:00.572 --> 29:01.614
What else can we do?

29:03.158 --> 29:05.994
Confession alone won't do.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.121
That depends on the content.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.415
You heard the recording too.

29:10.498 --> 29:14.502
He said details only the perp would know.

29:14.586 --> 29:19.632
You know? Things only he would know.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.634
Like the order in which he choked her.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.679
You heard it too. In the mountain.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.266
You weren't putting words in his mouth?

29:28.767 --> 29:29.684
What?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.728
Stop, you both. Let's eat first.

29:31.811 --> 29:32.896
Seriously!

29:38.818 --> 29:39.736
What's this?

29:40.653 --> 29:42.655
I asked for the sauce on the side.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.034
Fuck!

REPORT ON VICTIM ON DAY OF CRIME

30:39.087 --> 30:40.338
The victim

30:41.130 --> 30:43.132
on 12th and 16th

30:44.217 --> 30:45.593
on these two days

30:46.511 --> 30:47.512
at twelve o'clock…

30:48.680 --> 30:52.308
Oh, December 16th.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.977
On December 16th

30:54.561 --> 30:56.145
at twelve o'lock

30:57.105 --> 30:58.982
at Yangji Cafe located in Bangcheon…

WARRANT ISSUED
WITH INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

31:01.109 --> 31:02.610
CELEBRATORY SHOT ENDS IN SMOKE

31:02.694 --> 31:03.820
…meets Han Seong-geun

31:04.487 --> 31:06.614
who has an office job and is 32 years old.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.619
They were on a blind date, I think?

31:13.413 --> 31:15.373
So and

31:15.874 --> 31:19.460
at the scene, we found one footprint

31:19.544 --> 31:22.255
two bloodstains

31:22.338 --> 31:23.590
one semen

31:23.673 --> 31:24.591
total of--

31:24.674 --> 31:27.343
Did we have semen for this?

31:27.427 --> 31:28.386
Yes.

31:32.056 --> 31:36.060
Were there any similarities
between the two women who died?

31:38.396 --> 31:40.315
Similarities?

31:40.398 --> 31:45.320
Well they were both single.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.741
They were quite pretty.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.035
What else?

31:54.495 --> 31:56.331
It was raining on both days.

31:57.957 --> 31:58.791
Rain?

31:59.334 --> 32:01.085
They were killed on a rainy night.

32:02.712 --> 32:03.588
Really?

32:04.464 --> 32:05.340
And red clothing.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.509
The dead women were wearing red.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.136
Both of them?

32:11.304 --> 32:12.472
Three of them.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.642
Three?

32:16.434 --> 32:17.977
What's he talking about?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.729
There's one more woman.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.481
We just haven't found her body.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.737
This is a missing person report.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.072
Unique name, isn't it?

32:29.155 --> 32:31.366
Dokgo Hyeon-sun, 27.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.076
Filed missing two months ago, July 18th.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.827
Oh, her.

32:34.911 --> 32:37.330
Dokgo Hyeon-sun? I know her well.

32:37.413 --> 32:40.750
She's famous here.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.795
She's this pretty gal from Cheongsol-myeon

32:43.878 --> 32:46.881
and she's as pretty as Miss Korea.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.259
They've must've filed her missing
for leaving home--

32:50.343 --> 32:52.345
-Shut up.
-Yong-gu, weren't you--

32:53.346 --> 32:55.515
This is more than a missing case.

32:55.598 --> 32:57.684
A close look at the papers say so.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.560
Papers never lie.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.773
She was wearing a red blouse
at the time of missing.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.608
It's obvious from the papers alone.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.193
What's that?

33:07.694 --> 33:11.406
The highlighted part shows the weather
on the day she went missing.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.033
It was raining that evening too.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.495
Red clothes on a rainy day.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.290
I'm sure of it.
She was killed by the same perp.

33:21.374 --> 33:25.545
You don't know anything about this town.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.797
She's always talked of going to Seoul--

33:27.880 --> 33:29.549
-Hey!
-She's probably already--

33:29.632 --> 33:32.218
I can guess where the body would be.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.761
See the map on the last page.

33:35.179 --> 33:40.643
I've traced and marked her route that day
and estimated the location of crime here.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.440
Get me two squadrons of combat police.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.692
We'll have the body in two days.

33:50.820 --> 33:51.654
You confident?

34:11.883 --> 34:14.093
You know, college kids.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.720
Yeah, what's up?

34:15.803 --> 34:20.933
When they go on MT,
I hear the guys all get laid

34:21.726 --> 34:25.021
and everyone sleeps in the same room
and have orgies.

34:25.104 --> 34:26.272
Is that true?

34:27.356 --> 34:29.358
I don't know. Hurry up.

34:31.027 --> 34:34.363
But you have an associate degree!

34:34.447 --> 34:37.325
Membership training, orientation.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.078
Have you never been to one?

34:40.703 --> 34:44.665
Why don't you ask Seo there
with a four-year degree

34:44.749 --> 34:45.833
if they have orgies?

34:47.001 --> 34:48.836
-Here.
-Fucking four-year degree.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.256
I did high school for four years.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.261
Like this.

34:57.762 --> 34:58.596
No, not that.

34:59.097 --> 34:59.931
Forget it.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.561
I do miss Hyeon-sun.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.063
Right?

35:08.064 --> 35:11.567
-She is too pretty to rot in this town.
-Hey!

35:13.319 --> 35:15.446
She's probably in Seoul--

35:15.530 --> 35:19.492
-Don't run. Get out!
-What's going on?

35:19.575 --> 35:21.577
-Hm.
-There're a lot of snakes there.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.580
Don't touch it, jackass!

35:28.084 --> 35:30.878
A body decays at a different rate
depending on location.

35:30.962 --> 35:31.796
See?

35:31.879 --> 35:34.590
Despite it being old,
this part's completely intact.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.508
The thigh.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.010
Sign of rape?

35:39.262 --> 35:40.680
Some semen.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.641
But the sample's too old

35:43.724 --> 35:44.934
for us to get a reading.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.687
Hyeon-sun…

35:48.563 --> 35:52.567
Once again, he only used
items belonging to the victim.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.403
True.
She was choked using her stockings, right?

35:55.486 --> 35:56.737
Yes.

35:57.488 --> 36:02.076
Putting the victim's panties
over the head is the same.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.954
The way the hands are tied up
is the same, too.

36:05.037 --> 36:08.749
The MO and the after-measures all line up.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.419
Thorough.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.337
Flawless.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.467
So what you're saying

36:18.551 --> 36:21.429
is that there are no eyewitnesses.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.517
Some more thin skirt for you?

36:27.393 --> 36:29.395
We're good on the meat.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.606
Where's Gwang-ho?

36:31.689 --> 36:33.191
I don't see him.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.651
Is something wrong--

36:36.319 --> 36:40.656
I bought something for your son
but you can give it to him later.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.742
What is this?

36:42.825 --> 36:46.412
I saw the shoes he was wearing earlier

36:46.495 --> 36:49.248
and saw how old and smelly they were.

36:49.332 --> 36:53.628
I've been wanting to get him a new pair

36:53.711 --> 36:55.338
and picked up a pair of Nikes.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.340
You didn't have to!

36:58.758 --> 37:02.178
He's always sleeping in weird places.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.764
-Hey, can we get--
-On my way!

37:04.847 --> 37:05.848
Hey, Baek Gwang-ho.

37:06.641 --> 37:07.516
This kid.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.478
You're size seven, right?

37:11.145 --> 37:13.147
Try on these Nikes.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.110
Lemme see that.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.904
-See, earlier--
-Let's see.

37:19.987 --> 37:23.866
-These are Nices, not Nike.
-Nice, Nike, same thing.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.786
So long as they're sturdy to wear.
Try them on!

37:26.869 --> 37:31.374
If you're getting him a pair,
might as well get him the real ones.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.043
They look good!

37:39.090 --> 37:40.174
Have a shot.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.970
Beating is all part of affection.

37:44.053 --> 37:49.225
If you see me on the street,
don't run and say hi.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.310
Yong-gu here cried after you left--

37:53.479 --> 37:54.313
That kid.

38:00.319 --> 38:02.989
Hey, where're you off to now?

38:03.072 --> 38:03.990
That kid…

38:04.907 --> 38:05.950
Sergeant.

38:06.033 --> 38:10.121
He is as far as we could get
from our perp.

What are you doing here?

39:17.396 --> 39:19.398
All the way from Seoul?

39:20.358 --> 39:21.442
Well?

39:23.861 --> 39:25.112
To catch the perp.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.328
Is Seoul that big?

Is it?

39:41.462 --> 39:44.882
Give me a banana.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.969
You see, in the US

39:52.056 --> 39:54.058
there's a thing called the FBI.

39:55.434 --> 39:58.104
Do you know how they investigate?

40:01.649 --> 40:03.776
They fucking use their brains.

40:05.277 --> 40:06.529
They analyze.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.448
You know why?

40:10.950 --> 40:14.078
Because their land is fucking massive!

40:16.622 --> 40:21.127
So if they don't use their brains,
they can't cover all that land.

40:21.710 --> 40:26.340
That's why the fucking FBI
has to be smart about things.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.469
But you see, in the Republic of Korea

40:33.389 --> 40:35.891
a few steps here and there,

The land is fucking tiny.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.234
That's why they say

40:45.317 --> 40:47.653
that the detectives
of the Republic of Korea

40:47.736 --> 40:49.405
investigate with their two feet.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.324
There's an old saying like that.

40:52.783 --> 40:53.784
Jackass.

40:53.868 --> 40:56.120
A smart-ass like you

40:56.829 --> 40:58.205

Let go. No?

41:08.716 --> 41:09.550

41:23.647 --> 41:26.192

41:33.991 --> 41:36.327

does help clear the head.

I can finally think now.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.125
Things look clearer now.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.335
The perp.

41:45.377 --> 41:50.341
He's gonna strike again

on a wet, rainy night.

41:53.844 --> 41:54.678
Therefore

41:55.679 --> 41:57.681

45:19.883 --> 45:21.260
Start getting home earlier.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.470
Why are you out so late?

45:23.554 --> 45:25.764
We are okay because we're always together.

45:25.848 --> 45:29.268
You'd be fine even if you were alone.

45:32.146 --> 45:36.275
Nam-ju, tell that story to the detectives.

45:36.358 --> 45:37.276
What story?

45:37.359 --> 45:40.195
Remember? When we were cleaning earlier?

45:40.279 --> 45:41.113
Oh yeah!

45:41.196 --> 45:44.116
Do you know where the killer lives?

45:44.199 --> 45:45.367
I'm serious.

45:45.451 --> 45:49.121
We go to Ansong Girl's Middle School
and there's a really old toilet

45:49.204 --> 45:51.623
There's a crazy guy
that lives under the toilet

45:51.707 --> 45:53.375
and apparently that's the guy!

45:53.459 --> 45:57.963
He hides all day long
and comes out at night to kill the women!

45:58.046 --> 46:01.425
That must mean
if the killer shows up at night

46:01.508 --> 46:05.387
it would smell like poo
all along his path.

46:07.347 --> 46:08.599
That's not it.

46:08.682 --> 46:12.019
Yu-jin said some crazy woman
fell in and died.

46:12.102 --> 46:15.898
I'll bring the umbrella to the plant then.

46:17.232 --> 46:18.901
Uh-huh, sure.

46:20.402 --> 46:21.987
Yes.

46:22.112 --> 46:25.574
Okay then. I'll be right there.

46:34.666 --> 46:37.044
<i>♪My love, stay by my side♪</i>

46:37.127 --> 46:42.216
<i>♪Please don't leave me♪</i>

46:42.299 --> 46:47.930
<i>♪I still love you♪</i>

46:49.640 --> 46:51.892
<i>♪When I'm walking alone♪</i>

46:51.975 --> 46:53.602
<i>♪And dark night falls♪</i>

48:42.085 --> 48:42.961
Hello?

48:46.006 --> 48:48.008
Everyone stay in your position.

48:49.092 --> 48:51.845
Don't move anything around you

48:51.929 --> 48:53.221
and don't move another--

48:53.889 --> 48:54.723
Hey, you!

48:55.265 --> 48:58.894
You right there!
Nobody moves until forensics get here!

49:11.156 --> 49:12.991
Look.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.077
This is what you call a real footprint.

49:16.703 --> 49:19.998
You see the concrete plant there?

49:20.082 --> 49:23.502
So he grabbed her in front of the plant

49:24.419 --> 49:27.714
and dragged her in silence
for almost 400m.

49:30.592 --> 49:33.720
It's like seeing
a bride and a groom enter.

49:35.764 --> 49:41.520
We really have nothing
besides the footprint?

49:42.437 --> 49:46.775
I thought we might find his fingerprint
on the victim's umbrella, but to no avail.

49:47.484 --> 49:52.114
The footprint's likely no good
having been faded in the rain.

49:54.199 --> 49:57.160
So much
for the whole preserve-the-scene fiasco.

50:01.164 --> 50:05.502
That's where I think we have the clue.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.295
What do you mean?

50:07.379 --> 50:12.009
That we have no evidence
of the perp on the scene.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.472
You see, in every rape case

50:17.556 --> 50:23.603
you're bound to find some dick hair
somewhere on the scene.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.105
And?

50:25.188 --> 50:31.570
Therefore, our perp likely
has no hair down there to begin with.

50:31.653 --> 50:33.447
Like hairlessness?

50:33.530 --> 50:35.532
Right, hairlessness.

50:36.408 --> 50:37.242
Completely bald.

50:39.828 --> 50:41.997
So he has nothing to leave at the scene

50:43.040 --> 50:44.666
from the get-go.

50:44.750 --> 50:50.881
For example, if a monk shaved down there

50:50.964 --> 50:52.382
it'd be a perfect scenario.

50:53.341 --> 50:58.555
There's a temple called Yongdeoksa nearby.

50:59.347 --> 51:00.515
Should I start there?

51:08.648 --> 51:10.650
-Gwi-oak.
-Yes?

51:10.734 --> 51:12.736
The radio's on.

51:14.321 --> 51:16.656
How would you like your coffee?

51:16.740 --> 51:18.742
Lots of sugar for me.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.620
-Detective Seo.
-Yup.

51:22.829 --> 51:25.248
Got anything for us?

51:26.792 --> 51:29.503
As you saw today

51:29.586 --> 51:32.005
the perp is very thorough.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.382
-And?
-Therefore

51:34.466 --> 51:37.511
we would need to think outside the box--

51:37.594 --> 51:40.430
Then what? What are you suggesting?

51:42.724 --> 51:44.101
Man.

51:44.184 --> 51:47.312
I have something to show you all.

51:50.524 --> 51:53.360
What's she showing us today?

51:56.321 --> 51:57.322
What's this?

51:58.073 --> 52:01.243
I got this from the FM radio stations.

52:01.326 --> 52:04.204
It looks like a list of songs played.

52:04.287 --> 52:07.874
Yes. It's a hit music station
that I listen to often.

52:08.917 --> 52:13.421
There's a person
who always requests "A Gloomy Letter".

52:14.214 --> 52:17.008
See the dates the song was played.

52:18.260 --> 52:22.389
The song wasn't very popular
so they don't play it often.

52:22.472 --> 52:24.099
What's the song? What letter?

52:24.182 --> 52:25.976
"A Gloomy Letter"

52:26.059 --> 52:28.061
sung by Yu Jae-ha.

52:29.146 --> 52:32.065
-He used to be in Jo Yong-pil's band.
-Oh yes, the drummer.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.150
What about it?

52:35.318 --> 52:40.198
The days the song was played
match the dates of the crimes here.

52:43.451 --> 52:46.663
Look, October 20th.

52:46.746 --> 52:47.873
Park Bo-hee.

52:48.874 --> 52:52.002
December 19th.

52:52.085 --> 52:53.170
Lee Hyang-suk died.

52:54.254 --> 52:59.426
You mean this was playing
when Park Myeong-ja died yesterday?

53:00.051 --> 53:02.470
Yes, I listened to it myself yesterday.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.058
As the DJ played the song,
he read the request postcard.

53:08.393 --> 53:11.897
"Sent from a lonely man in Taeryeong-eup."

53:11.980 --> 53:14.065
"Please play it on a rainy night."

53:17.944 --> 53:20.614
Miss Gwon, nice! Good idea!

53:21.489 --> 53:23.867
Read your share of mystery novels, did ya?

53:25.160 --> 53:27.370
Thank you for sharing the story.

53:28.788 --> 53:31.791
This is too spot-on to be a coincidence.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.877
Look at the papers. Papers never lie.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.922
Here we go again.

53:37.005 --> 53:40.884
Maybe our perp is a psycho

53:40.967 --> 53:46.556
-who goes crazy when the song comes on.
-Now you too?

53:46.640 --> 53:48.183
Quit the nonsense.

53:48.266 --> 53:51.061
No, it does make sense. It's simple.

53:51.144 --> 53:55.440
It's like singing the national anthem
before starting the morning assembly.

53:55.523 --> 53:57.525
Did you secure the postcard?

53:57.609 --> 53:59.736
I did ask for it

53:59.819 --> 54:02.113
but they're really busy over there.

54:05.283 --> 54:09.704
Secure the postcard and check for
fingerprint, post stamp, and handwriting.

54:09.788 --> 54:10.747
Got it!

54:10.830 --> 54:13.416
Detective Gwon, call the station now.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.459
Now!

54:20.840 --> 54:23.885
Hairlessness. What about this?

54:23.969 --> 54:25.095
What about it?

54:25.178 --> 54:27.389
No hair down there, as we were discussing.

54:27.472 --> 54:28.348
The bald ones.

54:29.182 --> 54:31.226
How're you gonna look into that?

54:31.309 --> 54:34.229
Undress every man on the street?

54:46.866 --> 54:51.788
I called to make sure
you hold onto that postcard!

54:51.871 --> 54:53.498
What postcard?

54:53.581 --> 54:55.834
The one you played last night!

54:55.917 --> 54:57.460
We've got a ton of postcards!

55:00.130 --> 55:01.006
Mister.

55:02.799 --> 55:04.801
Put it on.

55:06.594 --> 55:07.470
Detective.

55:08.221 --> 55:11.599
They took out
the trash from yesterday already.

55:11.683 --> 55:13.685
It's no use looking in there.

55:28.241 --> 55:30.243
Aren't you washing?

55:32.620 --> 55:34.205
I've washed enough.

55:35.707 --> 55:39.002
My skin's all bloated.

55:39.753 --> 55:42.422
Did you find a hairless guy?

55:44.841 --> 55:47.010
Find one, my ass.

55:47.093 --> 55:49.179
I ended up spending a fortune on sauna.

55:49.262 --> 55:51.723
I can't even expense that shit.

55:51.806 --> 55:54.726
But your face looks clear for once.
I like it.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.729
You like it?

55:57.812 --> 56:00.648
Pants on and off, all day long.

56:00.732 --> 56:03.068
I'd be surprised
if I had any hair left by now.

56:08.782 --> 56:12.744
I asked the scrubber to let me know
when he sees a hairless guy

56:12.827 --> 56:14.037
and handed him my card.

56:14.871 --> 56:18.750
That fucker smirked at me.

56:21.086 --> 56:24.464
Don't stress all by yourself
and have the other guys work on it.

56:28.426 --> 56:31.638
Seo Tae-yun.
What's that Seoul guy doing these days?

56:34.349 --> 56:36.184
He's studying recent hits.

56:36.726 --> 56:37.811
What?

56:38.812 --> 56:40.814
There's this damn thing.

56:41.439 --> 56:43.525
He's talking nonsense these days too?

56:44.651 --> 56:45.777
I'm at a dead-end.

56:48.071 --> 56:51.533
if you're really at a dead end,
go see a fortune teller.

56:53.410 --> 56:54.285
A fortune teller?

56:55.036 --> 56:57.956
Yeah, go see a good one.

56:58.957 --> 57:02.669
Ask where the perp is.

57:04.379 --> 57:05.255
Well?

57:11.010 --> 57:13.221
It's the front gate of the police station.

57:14.097 --> 57:18.184
You gotta move it about 10m
to the southwest, not facing the east.

57:20.854 --> 57:22.856
I just saw a face.

57:23.857 --> 57:24.858
It must be him.

57:31.448 --> 57:32.365
AGRICULTURAL COOP

57:32.449 --> 57:35.618
Is it one of these?

57:37.287 --> 57:39.664
How dare you shove
these disgusting faces at me.

57:40.457 --> 57:42.792
-I mean, take a look.
-Get it away.

57:45.128 --> 57:46.713
You're messing with my fortune.

57:47.380 --> 57:48.756
JOLLY PONG, RICE SNACK

57:49.591 --> 57:52.385
Take this and do as I say.

57:53.052 --> 57:54.762
Don't try to sell me the talisman.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.492
Wait, hold on.

58:19.746 --> 58:22.749
You mix in the dirt from the crime scene.

58:23.917 --> 58:24.751
Mix it.

58:26.461 --> 58:28.588
She said this was the most important part.

58:29.672 --> 58:30.548
Now, pour.

58:35.887 --> 58:36.721
That's good.

58:39.641 --> 58:40.517
Good.

58:48.399 --> 58:50.401
Once this dries

58:50.485 --> 58:55.490
the stains will turn into the shape
of the perp's face.

58:55.573 --> 58:57.450
No way. How--

58:57.534 --> 58:59.536
You're bringing us bad luck!

58:59.619 --> 59:01.162

1:07:27.710 --> 1:07:32.048
-You! How dare you run!
-It hurts!

1:07:32.131 --> 1:07:32.965
Get up!

1:07:39.180 --> 1:07:40.014
Get out!

1:07:43.893 --> 1:07:44.727
Come on!

1:07:54.445 --> 1:07:58.616
I was just jerking off.

1:07:58.699 --> 1:07:59.784
Is that a crime?

1:07:59.867 --> 1:08:01.327
No, it isn't.

1:08:02.411 --> 1:08:04.413
But why'd you run if it isn't?

1:08:04.497 --> 1:08:08.167
Someone jumped out from the woods.

1:08:09.085 --> 1:08:10.461
It freaked me out.

1:08:11.462 --> 1:08:14.965
Why not jerk off at home?

1:08:15.716 --> 1:08:17.885
I have kids at home.

1:08:19.386 --> 1:08:21.889
And the air's fresh in the woods.

1:08:22.807 --> 1:08:27.228
No, you went there
to think about the woman you killed.

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:31.482
Excuse me.

1:08:31.565 --> 1:08:35.986
Your husband roams around outside
at night, doesn't he?

1:08:37.279 --> 1:08:38.155
What's this?

1:08:39.615 --> 1:08:41.075
Lemme see.

1:08:41.158 --> 1:08:44.078
Fighting for justice, Batman!

1:08:44.912 --> 1:08:46.497
What'd you use to make this?

1:09:01.762 --> 1:09:04.807
But you see, these days

1:09:04.890 --> 1:09:07.351
the things that happen here

1:09:07.434 --> 1:09:10.604
are much more provocative
than those magazines.

1:09:10.688 --> 1:09:13.107
I read the articles

1:09:13.190 --> 1:09:16.360
and let my imagination run wild.

1:09:16.443 --> 1:09:19.155
I think, 'what's wrong with me?'

1:09:19.238 --> 1:09:21.574
but then again, I think, 'when else?'

1:09:25.244 --> 1:09:26.996
According to the neighbors

1:09:27.079 --> 1:09:29.999
he takes good care of his sick wife

1:09:30.833 --> 1:09:32.251
regularly attends church

1:09:33.043 --> 1:09:35.254
is diligent
and just a great person overall.

1:09:37.298 --> 1:09:38.716
All perverts are like that.

1:09:39.550 --> 1:09:41.010
Looks normal on the outside.

1:09:41.677 --> 1:09:43.304
Can't fool my eyes though.

1:09:44.763 --> 1:09:45.931
He's it.

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:55.733
Honey, I put in extra pairs of socks
so do change frequently, after dinner--

1:09:55.816 --> 1:09:58.861
Okay, okay. Now go and feed the kids!

1:09:58.944 --> 1:10:01.405
They're protesting. You could get hurt!

1:10:01.488 --> 1:10:04.074
RELEASE BROTHER JO BYEONG-SUN

1:10:04.158 --> 1:10:07.494
No faith means hell!
Release Jo Byeong-sun!

1:10:07.578 --> 1:10:08.412
What now?

1:10:08.495 --> 1:10:10.706
I hear Jo Byeong-sun confessed overnight.

1:10:10.789 --> 1:10:12.082
Who said that?

1:10:12.166 --> 1:10:14.168
Come on, Sergeant!

1:10:15.294 --> 1:10:16.879
MAKE JUST SOCIETY

1:10:18.339 --> 1:10:20.341
When's the official report scheduled?

1:10:20.424 --> 1:10:21.759
No, I don't know anything.

1:10:21.842 --> 1:10:23.427
Be patient, won't you?

1:10:23.510 --> 1:10:26.180
You've been investigating four days
without a warrant.

1:10:26.263 --> 1:10:28.515
People are talking about
illegal imprisonment.

1:10:29.433 --> 1:10:33.062
This time, make it vivid like a movie.

1:10:35.522 --> 1:10:36.357
Go.

1:10:37.399 --> 1:10:38.651
You were so good before.

1:10:39.318 --> 1:10:40.277
Yong-gu?

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:48.452
So you were hiding behind the toilet

1:10:48.535 --> 1:10:54.208
when you saw Park Myeong-ja's flashlight

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:57.378
Yes, that sounds good.

1:10:59.296 --> 1:11:02.633
Yes or no? Make it clear.

1:11:07.554 --> 1:11:08.806
I think I dreamt that.

1:11:10.015 --> 1:11:15.104
So I approached her

1:11:15.187 --> 1:11:20.317
and then hit her neck with my bare hands.

1:11:20.442 --> 1:11:23.529
Bam! That must be it.

1:11:23.612 --> 1:11:25.614
-Bare hands--
-And then?

1:11:27.199 --> 1:11:32.204
Then Myeong-ja probably went "ow"
and then collapsed.

1:11:32.288 --> 1:11:35.916
Then I look at her

1:11:36.834 --> 1:11:38.836
and get ready to jump her…

1:11:39.336 --> 1:11:41.255
Wait, that's not it.

1:11:44.758 --> 1:11:47.094
Oh, right!
I drag her to the pine field first.

1:11:47.177 --> 1:11:50.347
From the rice field to the pine field

1:11:50.431 --> 1:11:54.560
is a whopping 200m, according to the news.

1:11:54.643 --> 1:11:56.353
That's a pretty long way.

1:11:56.437 --> 1:11:59.064
It's raining cats and dogs

1:11:59.148 --> 1:12:01.400
-and I drag her across.
-And then?

1:12:01.483 --> 1:12:02.943
-Then?
-Then

1:12:03.027 --> 1:12:05.195
I threw her on the pine field!

1:12:06.155 --> 1:12:08.157
Strangled her.

1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:09.867
Using what?

1:12:09.950 --> 1:12:11.118
Bag strap.

1:12:11.201 --> 1:12:12.077
You sure?

1:12:12.745 --> 1:12:13.829
Stockings.

1:12:16.081 --> 1:12:18.083
Oh, right.

1:12:18.834 --> 1:12:21.837
Bra. A Venus bra.

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:27.009
I used that
to strangle her neck like this.

1:12:27.092 --> 1:12:28.969
Like this.

1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:33.682
That's when she picked up a stone

1:12:33.766 --> 1:12:37.936
and hit me in the face.

1:12:39.730 --> 1:12:42.358
Right here, next to the eye.

1:12:43.650 --> 1:12:49.656
It hurts even though it was in the dreams.

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:04.004
Byeong-sun,
are you gonna keep saying "dream"?

1:13:04.088 --> 1:13:05.631
That's enough.

1:13:05.714 --> 1:13:08.258
Turn your face this way.

1:13:08.342 --> 1:13:10.761
That's where you got hit with the stone.

1:13:10.844 --> 1:13:13.806
-No, that's from yesterday when he--
-Shut up. Picture time.

1:13:17.601 --> 1:13:21.939
You've done so well until now
so let's wrap up now.

1:13:24.691 --> 1:13:30.239
So when I got hit in the face

1:13:30.322 --> 1:13:32.324
I was probably disoriented.

1:13:32.908 --> 1:13:35.244
I was lying down for a long time

1:13:35.327 --> 1:13:38.038
and when I came to my senses…

1:13:38.122 --> 1:13:39.456
Yes?

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:42.209
…I was in the bathroom.

1:13:42.292 --> 1:13:43.585
Toilet. Shit hole.

1:13:44.628 --> 1:13:47.131
So then I looked around

1:13:47.214 --> 1:13:49.007
and there are maggots everywhere.

1:13:49.091 --> 1:13:50.968
He won't wrap up.

1:13:51.051 --> 1:13:52.845
So I washed it off

1:13:52.928 --> 1:13:56.723
and climbed up using the hay

1:13:56.807 --> 1:14:00.227
and boy, was that hard even in the dream.

1:14:00.310 --> 1:14:03.856
When I got up, I saw that I wasn't home

1:14:03.939 --> 1:14:06.483
but at a school toilet.

1:14:07.860 --> 1:14:14.741
So I came out to the playground
and there were so many girls

1:14:14.825 --> 1:14:17.703
-and no matter what I said, the smell--
-Hey.

1:14:21.999 --> 1:14:25.169
Where'd you hear that story?

1:14:26.128 --> 1:14:28.338
Everyone knows this story.

1:14:28.422 --> 1:14:31.133
I saw it in my dream.

1:14:33.677 --> 1:14:36.013
From beneath the point of the accident

1:14:36.096 --> 1:14:39.308
stay on left and right
of the direction of the wind--

1:14:39.391 --> 1:14:41.393
Do you understand?

1:14:41.477 --> 1:14:42.978
Yes.

1:14:43.061 --> 1:14:46.732
-Let go. Let go!
<i>-As soon as this stage is over…</i>

1:14:46.815 --> 1:14:52.237
<i>-Class 2 move to the training field…</i>
<i>-</i>Okay, In-gyeong.

1:14:52.905 --> 1:14:58.911
<i>-Please report to the office…</i>
-That's not cool! Stop!

1:15:01.079 --> 1:15:05.292
You know that toilet story,
where'd you hear it?

1:15:05.375 --> 1:15:07.377
Is that why you're here?

1:15:12.216 --> 1:15:13.342
What's the matter?

1:15:13.425 --> 1:15:15.469
I got a scrape on my way down.

1:15:15.552 --> 1:15:17.971
Must've been a stone inside.

1:15:19.389 --> 1:15:20.516
Where's the nurse?

1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:24.520
Here, I'll put it on for you.

1:15:25.312 --> 1:15:26.271
I got it.

1:15:27.898 --> 1:15:29.775
Embarrassed, you kiddo?

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:31.235
Go sit.

1:15:34.279 --> 1:15:36.281
Here, give me the band-aid.

1:15:39.409 --> 1:15:40.369
Show me the scrape.

1:15:41.411 --> 1:15:43.413
Remember what I asked earlier?

1:15:43.497 --> 1:15:44.915
Give it a good thought.

1:15:47.918 --> 1:15:50.295
That story of the killer
hiding under the toilet

1:15:50.379 --> 1:15:51.880
and coming out at night.

1:15:52.714 --> 1:15:55.759
Things like who came up with the story.

1:15:56.677 --> 1:15:57.886
That makes no sense.

1:15:57.970 --> 1:16:00.389
That's like asking
who came up with old jokes?

1:16:00.472 --> 1:16:02.766
Who knows who made them up?

1:16:05.060 --> 1:16:07.437
Maybe you should see the toilet yourself.

1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:10.899
Do I look like I have the time?

1:17:02.409 --> 1:17:04.202
But still.

1:17:04.286 --> 1:17:07.414
You believed the kiddy stories
and came snooping around the toilet?

1:17:07.497 --> 1:17:08.999
Don't you have better things to do?

1:17:09.082 --> 1:17:11.793
-You scared the crap outta me.
-I was investigating-

1:17:11.877 --> 1:17:12.711
What now?

1:17:13.795 --> 1:17:15.797
Some investigation you've got going.

1:17:18.216 --> 1:17:22.012
Oh, I wonder
if that's what they're talking about.

1:17:23.889 --> 1:17:26.725
I've seen it a couple of times too.

1:17:26.808 --> 1:17:28.810
-There's a woman.
-A woman?

1:17:30.479 --> 1:17:31.688
There's a weeping woman.

1:17:33.023 --> 1:17:34.066
When was that again?

1:17:35.150 --> 1:17:37.861
I was in the bathroom then too.

1:17:39.029 --> 1:17:41.031
I heard a woman crying somewhere.

1:17:42.199 --> 1:17:43.825
I looked around when I got out.

1:17:44.701 --> 1:17:49.581
A woman was crying,
up that field in the middle of her work.

1:17:51.833 --> 1:17:53.543
A woman crying?

1:17:54.378 --> 1:17:55.212
Yeah.

1:17:56.505 --> 1:17:57.923
She kept crying.

1:17:59.549 --> 1:18:00.884
It was a weird sight.

1:18:21.571 --> 1:18:22.447
Hi.

1:18:25.450 --> 1:18:26.284
Excuse me.

1:18:29.121 --> 1:18:30.580
Do you live here?

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:34.042
Who are you?

1:18:36.753 --> 1:18:38.463
I want to ask you something.

1:18:38.547 --> 1:18:41.967
I heard that--

1:18:42.968 --> 1:18:43.802
Wait.

1:18:44.970 --> 1:18:46.638
Here, look.

1:18:46.722 --> 1:18:47.597
Police.

1:18:48.557 --> 1:18:49.391
Really?

1:18:49.474 --> 1:18:51.226
-Yeah--
-You can't be there.

1:18:52.477 --> 1:18:54.438
-Just a second--
-Someone might see you.

1:18:56.314 --> 1:18:57.399
No one's around.

1:19:02.654 --> 1:19:03.488
Leave.

1:19:04.698 --> 1:19:05.532
Please.

1:19:17.586 --> 1:19:20.922
We absolutely guarantee confidentiality.

1:19:22.466 --> 1:19:24.926
I'm also female
so you can be comfortable with me.

1:19:25.886 --> 1:19:28.764
Please be as specific as you can.

1:19:33.977 --> 1:19:35.061
That night…

1:19:40.901 --> 1:19:43.403
…was a drizzly night.

1:19:44.321 --> 1:19:45.322
When was this?

1:19:48.116 --> 1:19:49.284
It was…

1:19:53.789 --> 1:19:54.873
…last September.

1:20:05.217 --> 1:20:07.427
All the women killed so far…

1:20:09.763 --> 1:20:11.807
I read all about them in the paper.

1:20:14.810 --> 1:20:16.394
The way they were killed

1:20:17.771 --> 1:20:19.022
were exactly the same

1:20:20.982 --> 1:20:22.192
as what I experienced.

1:20:25.362 --> 1:20:26.238
The same.

1:20:33.161 --> 1:20:34.621
You remember his face, right?

1:20:35.372 --> 1:20:39.709
I kept my face down
so I wouldn't see his face.

1:20:41.670 --> 1:20:43.380
Even with the panties over my head

1:20:44.881 --> 1:20:46.174
I kept my eyes shut.

1:20:48.093 --> 1:20:51.680
If I'd seen his face,
he would've killed me.

1:20:54.891 --> 1:20:57.894
I don't know about anything else
but I do remember this.

1:20:59.646 --> 1:21:01.481
He had really soft hands.

1:21:02.899 --> 1:21:07.237
The hand that was covering my mouth
was pretty like that of a woman

1:21:07.904 --> 1:21:08.780
and soft.

1:21:43.023 --> 1:21:43.857
All set?

1:21:44.524 --> 1:21:45.817
Let's get some sleep now.

1:21:45.901 --> 1:21:46.860
RECORD OF TESTIMONY

1:21:46.943 --> 1:21:49.487
It'll be over when we stamp right here.

1:21:51.489 --> 1:21:52.741
Just as you testified.

1:21:54.159 --> 1:21:55.327
You like that, right?

1:21:55.410 --> 1:21:58.330
Yes, of course.

1:21:58.413 --> 1:22:02.083
So it's over now.

1:22:02.167 --> 1:22:03.668
Please let me down.

1:22:03.752 --> 1:22:04.920
Let me down.

1:22:10.300 --> 1:22:11.927
Let him down. He's not the perp.

1:22:12.552 --> 1:22:13.386
What?

1:22:14.596 --> 1:22:15.680
Hey, Jo Byeong-sun.

1:22:15.764 --> 1:22:16.848
Are you the perp?

1:22:16.932 --> 1:22:19.267
Sure, yes.

1:22:19.351 --> 1:22:21.353
Get outta here. You're not it.

1:22:21.436 --> 1:22:24.314
-I think I'm the perp--
-Let him down!

1:22:24.397 --> 1:22:26.107
What's going on?

1:22:26.191 --> 1:22:28.401
Don't leave out a word
from her statement--

1:22:28.485 --> 1:22:30.111
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1:22:30.195 --> 1:22:31.780
Having fun, are you?

1:22:31.863 --> 1:22:34.199

I never liked you, fucker.

-You hung Jo Byeong-sun, right?
-He kept lying.

A little before the first case last year.

1:29:05.673 --> 1:29:09.635
So ever since you left the army
and came to the plant in this town

1:29:10.511 --> 1:29:12.930
we are getting a series of these cases.

Yes.

You've sent it many times before.

1:29:25.485 --> 1:29:26.319
Yes.

1:29:27.695 --> 1:29:30.031
You asked it to be played on a rainy day.

Yes.

1:29:33.951 --> 1:29:35.244

You know a woman was killed
every time this song came on.

1:29:43.252 --> 1:29:44.087
No.

1:29:46.756 --> 1:29:48.758
Look at the play record. You see it?

1:29:51.010 --> 1:29:52.512
Okay, fine.

1:29:59.143 --> 1:29:59.977
Yes.

1:30:00.061 --> 1:30:02.105
You listened
to the evening hit music station.

1:30:02.188 --> 1:30:05.233
-Yes.
-Your song was played at 7:08 p.m.

1:30:05.316 --> 1:30:07.193
The program ended at 8:00 p.m.

1:30:07.276 --> 1:30:08.403
-Hear the end?
-Yes.

1:30:08.486 --> 1:30:10.822
-Did you listen to it in your room?
-Yes.

1:30:10.905 --> 1:30:12.573
What was the last song they played?

1:30:12.657 --> 1:30:14.659
-I don't know.
-You should. It was yesterday!

1:30:14.742 --> 1:30:17.078
-I don't remember.
-'Cause you weren't home!

1:30:17.161 --> 1:30:18.413
I too was home!

An Mi-seon's estimated time of death
is between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m.

1:30:21.833 --> 1:30:24.335
You ran out while listening to the radio.

1:30:24.419 --> 1:30:25.920
You've gotta be joking.

1:30:26.003 --> 1:30:29.632
-Jo Yong-gu!
-Does this look like a joke, fucker?

1:30:29.715 --> 1:30:31.175
-Put him down.
-Stop it.

1:30:35.388 --> 1:30:36.264
Get behind me.

1:30:41.310 --> 1:30:42.186
You here.

1:30:43.229 --> 1:30:46.983
Even the kids know
you're torturing innocent men here.

1:30:47.066 --> 1:30:48.317
Shut the fuck up, you--

1:30:48.401 --> 1:30:49.610
Get over here!

1:30:53.948 --> 1:30:55.283
I'm not gonna fall for it.

1:30:57.577 --> 1:30:58.536
Not a chance.

1:31:02.123 --> 1:31:03.666
Okay, Park Hyun-kyu.

1:31:04.584 --> 1:31:08.087
So you listened to that program
to the end, at home.

1:31:09.630 --> 1:31:12.842
Then there's no way
you can't remember the last song.

1:31:13.593 --> 1:31:17.555
Because as the DJ introduced the last song

1:31:17.638 --> 1:31:19.432
he said something noteworthy.

1:31:20.308 --> 1:31:23.394
He even talked about you
who sends in a lot of postcards.

1:31:24.770 --> 1:31:27.815
If you were listening,
there's no way you don't remember.

1:31:29.150 --> 1:31:31.402
So tell me, since you heard it all.

1:31:33.529 --> 1:31:34.405
I don't remember.

1:31:35.114 --> 1:31:36.157
You don't remember?

1:31:37.783 --> 1:31:39.452
Shall I tell it instead then?

1:31:43.623 --> 1:31:45.625
This is a recording from last night.

1:31:46.417 --> 1:31:47.877
["A Gloomy Letter" plays]

1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:51.005
You were listening to this
on a rainy evening yesterday.

1:31:52.798 --> 1:31:54.592
It was pouring outside

1:31:55.218 --> 1:31:57.303
and you heard the song come on the radio.

1:31:59.138 --> 1:32:01.349
You start to get the itch.

1:32:02.308 --> 1:32:06.229
Because there's a thing you do
every time you hear this song.

1:32:07.772 --> 1:32:11.901
From the landlady's room,
you can hear the soap opera on TV.

1:32:12.985 --> 1:32:18.032
You leave the light on in the room
and slip out quietly.

1:32:19.116 --> 1:32:23.371
Then you walk around in the dark.

1:32:25.164 --> 1:32:27.333
You think, 'Who's it gonna be today?'

1:32:29.377 --> 1:32:30.211
Right?

1:32:32.505 --> 1:32:35.675
Then you hide in the reed field
and wait for a woman to pass by.

1:32:36.884 --> 1:32:38.344
You are soaked in the rain.

1:32:38.427 --> 1:32:40.972
But to you, this is all fun.

1:32:41.055 --> 1:32:42.223
It's fun and exciting.

1:32:43.516 --> 1:32:46.227
So yesterday, you put this
inside the woman's body.

1:32:49.355 --> 1:32:51.691
Do you remember how many pieces?

1:32:53.401 --> 1:32:55.444
One, two.

1:32:56.153 --> 1:32:58.364
-Three, four.
-Stop.

1:32:58.447 --> 1:33:00.449
Five, six!

1:33:00.533 --> 1:33:01.951
-Seven, eight!
-Shut the fuck up!

1:33:02.034 --> 1:33:04.579
-You asshole!
-Jo Yong-gu!

1:33:04.662 --> 1:33:06.289
You son of a bitch!

1:33:09.917 --> 1:33:12.837
Didn't I tell you not to hit them?

1:33:14.380 --> 1:33:16.549
I told you not to him them!

1:33:16.632 --> 1:33:18.467
I warned you from the beginning.

1:33:18.551 --> 1:33:21.053
I warned you about the reporters!

1:33:21.554 --> 1:33:22.888
You moron.

1:33:26.350 --> 1:33:30.396
You're no longer allowed
in the interrogation room from now.

1:33:44.619 --> 1:33:46.120
This is driving me crazy.

1:33:49.832 --> 1:33:51.167
No eyewitness.

1:33:52.918 --> 1:33:54.295
No evidence.

1:33:56.339 --> 1:33:58.341
I can't do shit without anything.

1:33:59.467 --> 1:34:02.261
I don't need a fucking eyewitness.

1:34:03.429 --> 1:34:04.847
I just need him to talk.

1:34:05.931 --> 1:34:08.392
We can beat the crap out of him.

1:34:11.979 --> 1:34:13.189
You've changed.

1:34:16.192 --> 1:34:17.860
Go ahead and try.

1:34:17.943 --> 1:34:20.738
You'll just look stupid.
Like that time with Gwang-ho.

1:34:25.034 --> 1:34:26.702
Baek Gwang-ho.

1:34:30.998 --> 1:34:33.459
I meant to ask you this for a while.

1:34:33.542 --> 1:34:36.212
When we took Baek Gwang-ho to the woods.

1:34:37.338 --> 1:34:42.802
He said specifics about Lee Hyang-suk
in the middle of shoveling.

1:34:44.136 --> 1:34:45.012
What about it?

1:34:45.471 --> 1:34:50.393
You sure that wasn't rehearsed?

1:34:52.019 --> 1:34:53.396
I told you, no.

1:34:54.271 --> 1:34:58.401
Then how does he know
the order in which she was strangled--

1:34:58.484 --> 1:35:00.027
My question, exactly.

1:35:03.572 --> 1:35:06.742
Where's the tape
with the recording from the woods?

1:35:06.826 --> 1:35:08.828
Miss Gwon. Gwi-oak.

1:35:09.412 --> 1:35:14.709
<i>Then her body shivered and it looked like</i>

1:35:14.792 --> 1:35:16.293
<i>she was completely dead.</i>

1:35:16.377 --> 1:35:18.170
Here, listen to the way he talks.

1:35:18.254 --> 1:35:22.091
<i>Pulled it over Hyang-suk's head.</i>

1:35:23.175 --> 1:35:24.176
<i>Pulled what over?</i>

1:35:24.844 --> 1:35:26.512
<i>Her panties.</i>

1:35:26.637 --> 1:35:30.725
<i>Her panties were pulled over her head,</i>
<i>like a hat.</i>

1:35:30.850 --> 1:35:33.102
He's not talking about what he did…

1:35:33.185 --> 1:35:34.478
<i>-And then?</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

1:35:34.562 --> 1:35:35.438
…which means…

1:35:35.521 --> 1:35:36.772
<i>Put back on her clothes.</i>

1:35:36.856 --> 1:35:38.649
…he's talking about what he saw.

1:35:38.733 --> 1:35:40.025
<i>Why was that?</i>

1:35:40.109 --> 1:35:40.943
Right?

1:35:41.026 --> 1:35:42.278
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

1:35:43.237 --> 1:35:45.239
Baek Gwang-ho is the eyewitness.

1:35:46.073 --> 1:35:46.991
This way, sir.

1:35:51.454 --> 1:35:54.790
-Thanks for your work here. What the--
-What's up with them?

1:35:57.668 --> 1:35:58.961
Where's Gwang-ho?

1:35:59.044 --> 1:36:00.713
Why? Did something happen to--

1:36:00.796 --> 1:36:04.341
-Actually, we are--
-Nothing, we came to drink.

1:36:05.092 --> 1:36:07.094
Give us some meat here.

1:36:08.679 --> 1:36:10.681
What are you doing here?

1:36:20.107 --> 1:36:21.567
Don't drink too much!

1:36:22.651 --> 1:36:23.778
He's not in the room.

1:36:24.278 --> 1:36:28.115
-I'll take a look around town.
-Check the arcade.

1:36:30.075 --> 1:36:31.786
How long have you been here?

1:36:32.995 --> 1:36:35.247
Have you seen Baek Gwang-ho?

<i>--…for quasi-indecent act by force.</i>
-I wonder how he'll be prosecuted.

1:36:43.547 --> 1:36:45.132
<i>Here's reporter Hwang Chan-gyu.</i>

1:36:45.674 --> 1:36:47.343
That bastard.

1:36:47.426 --> 1:36:50.387
<i>-At today's trial…</i>
-You call those cops?

<i>the court decided,</i>
<i>before the inquisition, that--</i>

You gotta chop the dicks off
those damn detectives.

What good is that?

-Bastard!

1:37:36.892 --> 1:37:37.726
You bastard!

1:37:38.477 --> 1:37:40.312
Let go!

1:37:42.606 --> 1:37:47.278
You did it with the professor, didn't you?

1:37:47.361 --> 1:37:49.363
Fuck you, bitch!

1:37:52.408 --> 1:37:53.450
Let go!

1:37:53.951 --> 1:37:55.369
Fucker! You!

1:37:59.874 --> 1:38:01.667
Call the cops!

1:38:02.418 --> 1:38:03.919
Let go, asshole!

1:38:08.173 --> 1:38:09.008
Baek Gwang-ho!

1:38:09.675 --> 1:38:10.509
Bastard!

1:38:19.351 --> 1:38:20.895
What are we gonna do?

1:38:20.978 --> 1:38:21.937
Let go!

1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:25.774
You idiot!

1:38:25.858 --> 1:38:26.692
Isn't that wood?

1:38:27.985 --> 1:38:29.904
-Gwang-ho.
-Fuck!

1:38:30.821 --> 1:38:32.406
-Gwang-ho!
-You can't leave!

1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:35.200
-No, that's not it!
-Hey, Baek Gwang-ho!

1:38:36.076 --> 1:38:38.704
Baek Gwang-ho! Stop right there!

1:38:45.502 --> 1:38:46.337
Gwang-ho!

1:38:48.881 --> 1:38:51.675
-I'm sorry!
-What's the matter with you?

1:38:51.759 --> 1:38:55.429
-Hey!
-We're not here to get you. Come down.

1:38:55.512 --> 1:38:57.097
Hey, you!

1:38:57.181 --> 1:38:58.933
Are you gonna kill me?

1:38:59.016 --> 1:39:03.062
Let's say the thing just now
never happened.

1:39:03.145 --> 1:39:06.106
It could happen in any fight, right?

1:39:06.190 --> 1:39:09.735
Everything's fine, so get down here.

1:39:09.818 --> 1:39:13.364
You're gonna kill me, right? I know it.

1:39:13.447 --> 1:39:15.658
We're not killing anyone. Come down--

1:39:15.741 --> 1:39:18.661
Okay, you can stay there and talk.

1:39:18.744 --> 1:39:24.291
Let me ask you something.
Do you remember Hyang-suk?

1:39:24.375 --> 1:39:25.751
Hyang-suk who died.

1:39:27.211 --> 1:39:28.671
Hyang-suk is pretty.

1:39:30.422 --> 1:39:33.759
That's right.
The one you used to follow around.

1:39:33.842 --> 1:39:38.639
That night, when it was pouring outside

1:39:38.722 --> 1:39:40.891
you saw her die, right?

1:39:41.475 --> 1:39:44.228
I already told you everything.

1:39:44.311 --> 1:39:45.521
In the woods.

1:39:46.563 --> 1:39:48.399
I told you when we went shoveling.

1:39:48.482 --> 1:39:52.486
Right. You saw her get killed, here.

1:39:52.569 --> 1:39:54.571
Yes, right here.

1:39:55.823 --> 1:39:58.075
Here, over the railroad.

1:40:02.079 --> 1:40:06.333
Did you see the face of the guy
who killed Hyang-suk?

1:40:07.042 --> 1:40:08.043
Yes.

1:40:08.127 --> 1:40:09.003
Are you sure?

1:40:10.254 --> 1:40:11.714
Lightning. Boom!

1:40:15.342 --> 1:40:18.512
I was sleeping in places like this
and saw it all.

1:40:18.595 --> 1:40:22.683
So you saw his face?

1:40:22.766 --> 1:40:24.435
Saw it three times.

1:40:25.936 --> 1:40:27.938
Do you remember his face accurately?

1:40:29.606 --> 1:40:30.899
He's good looking.

1:40:32.192 --> 1:40:33.861
He's better looking than me.

1:40:39.575 --> 1:40:41.660
Is this the face you saw?

1:40:44.747 --> 1:40:45.581
Look closely.

1:40:55.883 --> 1:40:58.218
Do you know how hot fire is?

1:40:58.302 --> 1:41:00.054
Take a proper look at the photo!

1:41:00.763 --> 1:41:02.973
-Fire is really hot!
-Come on!

1:41:03.057 --> 1:41:04.516
Get to your senses!

1:41:05.059 --> 1:41:06.143
Here.

1:41:07.019 --> 1:41:08.020
Look carefully.

1:41:08.103 --> 1:41:10.647
It's hot! Hot!

1:41:10.731 --> 1:41:12.816
Look at the photo!

1:41:12.900 --> 1:41:16.403
-When I was young…
-Baek Gwang-ho.

1:41:16.487 --> 1:41:20.032
…that person threw me into the furnace.

1:41:20.115 --> 1:41:22.076
-Gwang-ho!
-You asshole!

1:41:22.159 --> 1:41:23.077
What's going on?

1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:24.828
Fuck!

1:41:24.912 --> 1:41:28.624
-Please let him go.
-Mr. Baek!

1:41:28.707 --> 1:41:29.875
This bastard!

1:41:29.958 --> 1:41:32.002
Why are you doing this, Detective Park?

1:41:32.086 --> 1:41:34.505
-Fuck!
-I'm a cop!

1:41:34.588 --> 1:41:36.882
-Let go!
-Fuck!

1:41:36.965 --> 1:41:38.717
-Let go!
-Hey!

1:41:38.801 --> 1:41:40.469
Baek Gwang-ho, hold on!

1:41:40.552 --> 1:41:41.970
-Let go!
-You idiot!

1:41:42.054 --> 1:41:44.807
-Let go!
-Where do you think you're going?

1:41:52.147 --> 1:41:53.023
Hey, Gwang-ho!

1:41:54.149 --> 1:41:56.193
Went all over looking for you.

1:41:57.402 --> 1:41:58.237
Hey.

1:41:59.238 --> 1:42:01.240
The train's coming. Get down here!

1:42:02.074 --> 1:42:02.950
Come on!

1:42:07.538 --> 1:42:08.789
Hey! Move over right now.

1:42:10.249 --> 1:42:12.334
-Hey, you!
-It's dangerous there.

1:42:12.417 --> 1:42:15.003
-Go!
-Let's go! You're gonna die!

1:42:15.087 --> 1:42:16.839
-Don't come. Go!
-You'll get hurt!

1:42:16.922 --> 1:42:19.925
-Hey!
-Go!

1:42:57.754 --> 1:43:00.924
You sure it's okay to be here?
They're probably looking for you.

1:43:37.169 --> 1:43:38.962
Yes.

1:43:39.046 --> 1:43:41.340
When writing articles, reporters can be…

1:43:41.423 --> 1:43:43.717
SUSPECT BAEK'S MENTAL ILLNESS
WORSENED AFTER INTERROGATION

1:43:43.800 --> 1:43:45.886
As I told you the other day…

1:43:45.969 --> 1:43:47.554
SUSPECT PARK RELEASED AFTER THREE DAYS

1:43:47.638 --> 1:43:48.472
Hello?

1:43:49.097 --> 1:43:49.932
Hello?

1:43:50.724 --> 1:43:52.100
Bastards.

1:43:53.018 --> 1:43:55.103
Fucking bastards.

1:43:55.604 --> 1:43:56.688
Sergeant!

1:43:56.772 --> 1:43:57.689
What!

1:43:58.148 --> 1:44:01.443
It's the National Forensic Service.
They found a semen sample.

1:44:01.944 --> 1:44:02.903
What did you say?

1:44:02.986 --> 1:44:04.321
Look carefully.

1:44:04.404 --> 1:44:07.491
We found this drop of semen
on the victim's clothing.

1:44:07.574 --> 1:44:13.747
My guess is that it splattered
while the perpetrator was masturbating.

1:44:13.830 --> 1:44:14.915
-As of now--
-Hold on.

1:44:15.332 --> 1:44:16.250
We got that.

1:44:17.376 --> 1:44:19.878
If we can confirm
that the DNA print from the semen

1:44:20.587 --> 1:44:22.881
and the DNA print from Park Hyun-kyu

1:44:23.507 --> 1:44:25.509
actually match

1:44:26.385 --> 1:44:29.596
then it's game over.

1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:32.557
Yes, this is as sure an evidence
as we can get.

1:44:33.392 --> 1:44:39.856
The trouble is that in Korea,
we don't have the tools to analyze this.

1:44:41.024 --> 1:44:44.611
We need to send the semen to the US.
That's the only way for now.

1:44:45.195 --> 1:44:46.029
The US…

1:44:46.113 --> 1:44:49.658
As soon as the analysis is finished,
you'll get immediate results.

1:44:49.741 --> 1:44:53.453
So we just wait
for the result to get back from the US?

1:44:53.537 --> 1:44:54.371
Correct.

1:44:55.872 --> 1:44:58.959
You got eyes on Park Hyun-kyu, right?

1:44:59.042 --> 1:45:02.838
Yes, around the clock, in shifts.

1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:06.091
Just you wait
for that result from the US!

1:45:06.174 --> 1:45:09.219
I'm gonna knock him out
with a single blow!

1:45:26.987 --> 1:45:28.405
-Hey.
-Yeah?

1:45:28.488 --> 1:45:29.614
What's with your leg?

1:45:29.698 --> 1:45:31.033
-Huh?
-What about my leg?

1:45:31.116 --> 1:45:32.200
Did you see a doctor?

1:45:32.284 --> 1:45:35.871
-I don't need to see a doctor for this.
-Lemme see.

1:45:35.954 --> 1:45:38.290
I rubbed on Antiphlamine already.

1:45:39.374 --> 1:45:43.211
-What is this?
-Remember, last time…

1:45:44.338 --> 1:45:45.839
It keeps swelling.

1:45:45.922 --> 1:45:47.007
Let's get going.

1:45:47.674 --> 1:45:48.508
Let's go.

1:45:49.009 --> 1:45:50.093
PARK JONG-JU, MD

1:45:50.177 --> 1:45:52.721
Chop off his leg?

1:45:53.555 --> 1:45:55.640
You want me to explain it again?

1:45:55.724 --> 1:45:59.061
It was just a nail.
Why chop off a perfectly good leg?

1:45:59.144 --> 1:46:01.146
He could die.

1:46:02.356 --> 1:46:06.068
Tetanus is serious stuff.

1:46:06.151 --> 1:46:09.279
You get stabbed by a rusty nail,
you come straight to a doctor.

1:46:09.363 --> 1:46:11.365
You stupid morons.

1:46:12.407 --> 1:46:14.076
It's too late to change anything.

1:46:14.159 --> 1:46:17.120
It's not the worst of things.
We're cutting below the knee.

1:46:19.956 --> 1:46:20.916
Let's go.

1:46:24.461 --> 1:46:25.379
Family, right?

1:46:25.462 --> 1:46:27.798
He's got no family.
I'm a brother of sort but--

1:46:27.881 --> 1:46:29.591
But you are his guardian, right?

1:46:29.674 --> 1:46:32.260
This is the agreement for the operation.

1:46:32.344 --> 1:46:34.137
Read through and sign.

1:46:36.932 --> 1:46:38.058
NECROSIS OF FOOT BY TETANUS

1:46:38.141 --> 1:46:40.435
I agree not to raise any objections
regarding the treatment.

1:46:40.519 --> 1:46:41.603
PATIENT FAMILY NAME

1:46:51.613 --> 1:46:53.365
Son of a bitch.

1:47:09.005 --> 1:47:10.257
Is this the post office?

1:47:11.258 --> 1:47:13.343
This is Seo from the Investigation Unit.

1:47:14.010 --> 1:47:17.389
Did the papers arrive yet from the US?

1:47:20.016 --> 1:47:21.476
Did you check thoroughly?

1:47:23.228 --> 1:47:25.480
I keep calling because it's important.

1:47:26.731 --> 1:47:31.111
Anyway, it really is important
so let me know as soon as it arrives.

1:47:31.987 --> 1:47:32.821
Okay.

1:47:35.365 --> 1:47:36.199
Hello?

1:47:40.036 --> 1:47:41.413
Right now?

1:47:42.789 --> 1:47:44.499
Why would you call me out here?

1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.377
What, am I not allowed to call you out?

1:47:48.295 --> 1:47:49.921
Your face is a mess.

1:47:50.797 --> 1:47:52.007
Have you been sleeping?

1:47:54.468 --> 1:47:56.470
What detective sleeps regularly?

1:47:58.763 --> 1:48:02.350
-Why the attitude?
-Lucky bastards, just fishing away.

1:48:07.314 --> 1:48:08.940
Why'd you call me out? I'm busy.

1:48:13.987 --> 1:48:15.989
This is no way to live.

1:48:19.868 --> 1:48:21.870
I'm not the one to talk

1:48:22.871 --> 1:48:24.498
but can't you do something else?

1:48:26.625 --> 1:48:28.293
Can't you quit detective?

1:48:47.896 --> 1:48:49.898
HANGOVER SOUP

1:49:08.750 --> 1:49:09.584
Why?

1:49:11.044 --> 1:49:11.878
Let's go.

1:49:25.267 --> 1:49:27.269
GWANGJIN TRANSPORTATION

1:49:49.791 --> 1:49:50.792
Calling Homicide.

1:49:51.585 --> 1:49:52.502
Homicide!

1:49:53.253 --> 1:49:55.672
Where are you going so late?

1:49:55.755 --> 1:49:57.757
Cash is good, isn't it?

1:49:57.841 --> 1:50:00.302
PHARMACY

1:50:00.385 --> 1:50:02.512
Bo-gyeong's grandma collapsed again.

1:50:02.596 --> 1:50:03.722
I gotta go.

1:50:03.805 --> 1:50:07.392
Why, you deserve an award.

1:50:07.475 --> 1:50:09.603
The Health Department should give you one!

1:50:19.863 --> 1:50:20.864
Sergeant.

1:50:20.947 --> 1:50:23.325
He hasn't returned home in two hours.

1:50:23.408 --> 1:50:26.453
It's six stops from there to his place

1:50:27.078 --> 1:50:29.039
so he definitely got off in the middle.

1:50:29.122 --> 1:50:31.750
He's been arrested once. He wouldn't dare.

1:50:31.833 --> 1:50:34.377
He would be more than happy
to mess with us!

1:50:34.961 --> 1:50:36.963
He was crazy to begin with.

1:50:37.547 --> 1:50:39.049
You look crazy right now.

1:50:39.132 --> 1:50:42.510
As soon as we have the DNA analysis

1:50:42.594 --> 1:50:44.346
that is the end of this.

1:50:44.429 --> 1:50:45.639
That's right.

1:50:45.722 --> 1:50:48.224
How could I miss him?

1:50:48.308 --> 1:50:50.852
Stop it! You're making me anxious!

1:50:50.935 --> 1:50:52.854
That son of a bitch.

1:52:23.820 --> 1:52:28.408
REAL ESTATE
LAND

1:52:32.245 --> 1:52:36.624
<i>This is the civil defense drill alert.</i>

1:52:36.708 --> 1:52:39.335
<i>A defense drill alert has been issued.</i>

1:52:39.419 --> 1:52:43.798
<i>As of current,</i>
<i>a nation-wide drill alert has been issued.</i>

1:52:46.760 --> 1:52:48.511
<i>…please prepare for safety…</i>

1:53:04.819 --> 1:53:07.530
OPTICIAN, SAEMAEUL BANK

1:53:07.614 --> 1:53:10.366
<i>…comply with the orders…</i>

1:53:17.207 --> 1:53:19.834
<i>This is a drill.</i>

1:53:55.578 --> 1:53:59.624
What's your stance
on the investigation this time?

1:54:15.098 --> 1:54:17.475
Stab wounds
caused by a cutter in the chest.

1:54:20.687 --> 1:54:21.938
Goodness, what is this?

1:54:23.773 --> 1:54:26.276
There's a lot of objects
stuck in the genital area.

1:54:27.652 --> 1:54:28.695
What is this?

1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:32.448
It looks like a Monami ball-point pen
and a spoon.

1:54:33.283 --> 1:54:35.285
What the hell is this?

1:54:39.414 --> 1:54:41.749
-Check the inside thoroughly.
-Okay.

1:54:47.547 --> 1:54:49.591
What's that over there?

1:54:50.717 --> 1:54:53.177
It looks like an old band-aid.

1:55:07.692 --> 1:55:09.694
-What?
-What are you doing?

1:55:11.696 --> 1:55:14.157
Why are you touching the body?

1:55:39.557 --> 1:55:40.516
What are you doing?

1:55:44.270 --> 1:55:45.271
Get up, you bastard!

1:55:47.857 --> 1:55:48.691
Fuck.

1:55:53.237 --> 1:55:55.239
You fucking bastard!

1:55:58.743 --> 1:56:00.370
Get up, you bastard!

1:56:00.453 --> 1:56:02.455
-Come on!
-Let go!

1:56:03.206 --> 1:56:05.625
You call yourself a human?

1:56:06.334 --> 1:56:07.752
Monster. Animal.

1:56:09.462 --> 1:56:10.505
Son of a bitch!

1:56:11.589 --> 1:56:12.548
Bastard!

1:56:16.010 --> 1:56:17.679
Shit!

1:56:17.762 --> 1:56:20.807
Say it. I can kill you right here

1:56:20.890 --> 1:56:22.892
and no one would give a damn.

1:56:33.361 --> 1:56:34.195
Say it.

1:56:36.322 --> 1:56:37.323
Say you killed her.

1:56:40.493 --> 1:56:41.452
Say it.

1:56:42.328 --> 1:56:44.956
Come on and say it alll!

1:57:05.309 --> 1:57:06.144
Fine.

1:57:07.353 --> 1:57:08.187
I did it.

1:57:10.940 --> 1:57:12.483
I killed them all.

1:57:16.863 --> 1:57:18.281
Is that what you wanna hear?

1:57:20.116 --> 1:57:20.950
Is it?

1:57:22.618 --> 1:57:24.912
Satisfied? Well?

1:57:27.790 --> 1:57:28.791
Hey!

1:57:29.375 --> 1:57:31.878
Detective Seo! It's here!

1:57:33.087 --> 1:57:35.089
We have the paper from the US!

1:57:35.715 --> 1:57:36.758
Hurry and read it.

1:57:38.426 --> 1:57:39.385
You bastard.

1:57:40.053 --> 1:57:41.387
Son of a bitch.

1:57:41.471 --> 1:57:43.014
Fucker.

1:57:43.097 --> 1:57:45.308
Your days of mocking us is over.

1:57:45.391 --> 1:57:46.851
-Hey!
-Fuck.

1:57:49.604 --> 1:57:52.440
Bastard mocked us.

1:58:08.581 --> 1:58:09.499
What's the matter?

1:58:32.396 --> 1:58:34.565
Since the DNA fingerprint
of the suspect Park Hyun Kyu

1:58:34.649 --> 1:58:37.401
does not correspond exactly
to that semen sample in the victim's body

1:58:37.485 --> 1:58:40.071
it cannot be said conclusively
that the suspect is the murderer.

1:58:41.864 --> 1:58:43.157
Something's not right.

1:58:54.168 --> 1:58:55.586
This is all a lie.

1:58:55.670 --> 1:58:56.879
I don't need this.

1:59:10.685 --> 1:59:12.937
Detective Seo, what does it say?

1:59:21.279 --> 1:59:23.990
You're really not it?

1:59:31.080 --> 1:59:32.707
Look at me straight in the eyes.

2:00:03.905 --> 2:00:05.364
I said, straight in the eyes.

2:00:20.087 --> 2:00:21.714
Damn it. I can't tell.

2:00:29.430 --> 2:00:30.765
Do you even eat?

2:00:35.519 --> 2:00:36.354
Go.

2:00:39.565 --> 2:00:40.733
Go, you son of a bitch.

2:01:56.642 --> 2:01:57.643
It's time to stop.

2:02:32.970 --> 2:02:38.434
2003

2:02:38.517 --> 2:02:39.560
Chi-hyeok.

2:02:41.270 --> 2:02:43.272
Played computer games all night?

2:02:45.066 --> 2:02:45.900
Well?

2:02:46.859 --> 2:02:47.777
Yes or no?

2:02:52.656 --> 2:02:53.866
Look at me straight.

2:02:55.451 --> 2:02:56.619
Bloodshot eyes.

2:02:58.162 --> 2:02:59.705
Are you good at these games?

2:02:59.789 --> 2:03:00.623
Yeah.

2:03:01.123 --> 2:03:03.709
As you should be.
Not like you are good at studying.

2:03:06.337 --> 2:03:09.757
If you don't wanna study,
you should go out and work out.

2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:12.510
What's a guy doing
sitting at a computer all day long?

2:03:12.593 --> 2:03:13.761
I didn't play.

2:03:14.303 --> 2:03:15.471
Sure, you didn't.

2:03:16.389 --> 2:03:18.224
You can't fool me.

2:03:19.809 --> 2:03:21.769
He says he didn't. Have some faith.

2:03:22.436 --> 2:03:27.525
Mr. Oh called himself the other day.

2:03:28.984 --> 2:03:31.695
Always telling me, "that's no way to act."

2:03:31.779 --> 2:03:32.780
How am I to act?

2:03:33.697 --> 2:03:36.450
You can't just take his word for it.

2:03:37.743 --> 2:03:39.745
It's all part of a strategy.

2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:42.039
Don't worry.

2:03:42.998 --> 2:03:44.959
I'm on my way with the goods.

2:03:45.042 --> 2:03:46.419
GREEN POWER JUICE EXTRACTOR

2:03:46.502 --> 2:03:47.378
Yeah.

2:03:48.587 --> 2:03:49.547
Sure.

2:03:49.630 --> 2:03:51.382
Let's grab a meal with Mr. Oh.

2:03:52.925 --> 2:03:54.343
It's been a while.

2:03:55.803 --> 2:03:56.637
Sure thing.

2:03:57.847 --> 2:03:59.306
-Cheol-yong.
-Yeah.

2:03:59.390 --> 2:04:00.599
Pull over for a second.

2:05:38.697 --> 2:05:40.032
Is there something inside?

2:05:40.741 --> 2:05:41.575
Huh?

2:05:42.201 --> 2:05:43.619
Is there something in there?

2:05:45.204 --> 2:05:46.872
Nah.

2:05:47.498 --> 2:05:48.958
Then why're you looking?

2:05:51.794 --> 2:05:52.920
Just 'cause.

2:05:54.380 --> 2:05:55.464
That's so weird.

2:05:58.050 --> 2:05:58.884
What is?

2:06:00.761 --> 2:06:06.141
There was another man
looking in there the other day.

2:06:10.563 --> 2:06:12.940
I asked him then too.

2:06:13.983 --> 2:06:15.067
Why he's looking in.

2:06:15.818 --> 2:06:16.860
And?

2:06:18.362 --> 2:06:19.738
What was it again?

2:06:20.864 --> 2:06:21.782
Oh, right.

2:06:22.366 --> 2:06:25.869
He said he was reminiscing
what he did here a while ago.

2:06:26.662 --> 2:06:28.789
It's been a really long time.

2:06:29.582 --> 2:06:30.624
That's what he said.

2:06:44.221 --> 2:06:45.723
Did you see his face?

2:06:51.478 --> 2:06:52.688
What does he look like?

2:06:54.898 --> 2:06:55.816
It's just

2:06:57.943 --> 2:06:58.986
a common face.

2:07:01.697 --> 2:07:02.573
How so?

2:07:06.118 --> 2:07:06.994
It's just

2:07:09.663 --> 2:07:10.539
ordinary.

2:10:51.635 --> 2:10:53.470
