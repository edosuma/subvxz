to the Western Air Temple?

maybe you should be a part of this.

Fair enough.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.780
So what's the new plan?

04:39.990 --> 04:44.620
Well, if you ask me,
the new plan is the old plan.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.700
You just need to master all four elements

04:46.790 --> 04:48.960
and confront the Fire Lord
before the comet comes.

04:49.170 --> 04:53.840

come up with anybody.

prison together in Ba Sing Se.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.670

11:06.750 --> 11:08.790
and making it seem like he's
an actual human being with feelings.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.760
He wants you to trust him
and feel sorry for him

11:11.840 --> 11:14.680
so you let your guard down,
then he strikes.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.760

confused and hurt.

he made his choice

and I got captured by Zhao?

from the back of my throat for a month.

there was nothing there.

It's my throatal flap.

it was Zuko who came in and got me out.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.680
He risked his life to save me.

11:56.880 --> 12:00.680
No way, I'm sure he only did it
so he could capture you himself.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.180

you're nothing but a big prize to him.

12:03.270 --> 12:05.100
You're probably right.

12:05.180 --> 12:07.560

stuff about setting Appa free?

12:07.650 --> 12:09.610
What a liar.

12:09.690 --> 12:10.730
Actually, he wasn't lying.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.400
Oh, hooray.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.240
In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't
add animal cruelty to the list.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.580
I'm just saying that considering his
messed-up family and how he was raised

12:21.740 --> 12:23.910
he could've turned out a lot worse.

find him and give him a medal...

The "not as much of a jerk
as you could've been" award.

All I know is that while he was
talking to us, he was sincere.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.590
Maybe you're all just letting your hurt
feelings keep you from thinking clearly.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.300
Easy for you to say, you weren't there
when he had us attacked by pirates.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.640

12:49.900 --> 12:54.020
Because, Katara, you're all
ignoring one crucial fact.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.690
Aang needs a firebending teacher.

12:56.780 --> 12:59.200
We can't think of a single person in
the world to do the job.

12:59.660 --> 13:03.370
Now one shows upon a silver platter and
you won't even think about it?

13:06.500 --> 13:09.670
I'm not having Zuko as my teacher.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.420
You're darn right you're not, buddy.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.420
Well, I guess that's settled.

13:14.130 --> 13:17.760
( GROANS ) I'm beginning to wonder
who's really the blind one around here.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.640
( LEAVES RUSTLING )

13:26.850 --> 13:29.310
Who's there?

13:29.390 --> 13:30.390
Stay back.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.850
It's me!

13:32.060 --> 13:33.810
Ow!

13:35.730 --> 13:37.230
You burned my feet.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.400
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

13:40.030 --> 13:42.030
Get away from me.

13:45.330 --> 13:46.910
Let me help you.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.750
I'm sorry.

13:49.910 --> 13:52.210
Get off me, get off me.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.630
( GRUNTS )

13:55.040 --> 13:57.550
I didn't know it was you.
( GROANS )

13:57.760 --> 13:59.380
Come back!

14:01.340 --> 14:02.760
( GROANS )

14:02.840 --> 14:05.510
Why am I so bad at being good?

14:16.650 --> 14:18.570
Has anyone seen Toph?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.860
I haven't seen her
since she stormed off yesterday.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.030
Maybe she's just exploring the Air Temple.

14:23.110 --> 14:26.120
There are some pretty fun spots
to practice earthbending.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.580
I think we should go look for her.

14:28.790 --> 14:30.700
Oh, let her have fun with her rocks.

14:30.790 --> 14:32.660
I'm in no rush to have her
yelling at us again.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.130
We can go check for her.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.920
Yeah, I want to ride that tunnel down
to the hall of statues again.

14:38.050 --> 14:41.260
It'll work a lot better now that I fixed
my brakes.

14:44.760 --> 14:49.260
( CRASH )

14:49.350 --> 14:50.850
( GRUNTING )

14:51.180 --> 14:52.810
KATARA: Toph, what happened?

14:52.940 --> 14:54.310
My feet got burned.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.520
Oh, no, what happened?

14:56.690 --> 14:59.980
I just told you, my feet got burned.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.030
I meant how.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.490
Well, I kind of went to see Zuko
last night.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.820
You what?

15:05.910 --> 15:07.490
- Zuko?
-( GASPS )

15:07.570 --> 15:09.580
I just thought he could be helpful to us

15:09.660 --> 15:12.750
and if I talked to him,
maybe we could work something out.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.500
So he attacked you?

15:14.750 --> 15:17.040
Well, he did and he didn't.

15:17.130 --> 15:19.290
It was sort of an accident.

15:19.550 --> 15:20.880
But he did firebend at you?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.380
( SIGHS ) Yes.

15:23.510 --> 15:27.970
See, you trusted Zuko and
you got burned... Literally.

15:28.050 --> 15:30.310
It's gonna take a while
for your feet to get better.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.970
I wish I could've worked on them sooner.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.810
Yeah, me too.

15:33.890 --> 15:36.060
Zuko's clearly too dangerous
to be left alone.

15:36.350 --> 15:37.940
We're gonna have to go after him.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.440
I hate to go looking for
a fight, but you're right.

15:40.610 --> 15:44.030
After what he did to Toph,
I don't think we have a choice.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.280
He's crafty, but we'll find
a way to capture him.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.530
TOPH: Maybe just invite him back here.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.450
He's already offered himself up
as a prisoner once.

15:51.540 --> 15:55.370
Yeah... Get him to come back
and say he'll be our prisoner

15:55.580 --> 15:58.460
then we'll jump him and really
make him our prisoner.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.340
He'll never suspect it.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.630
You are a master of surprise, Sokka.

16:05.170 --> 16:07.630
Ahh, that's the stuff.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.970
Now I know how the rest of you guys feel.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.100
Not being able to see
with your feet stinks.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.250
( GRUNTS )

16:44.130 --> 16:45.710
ZUKO: Stop!

16:45.960 --> 16:49.890
I don't want you
hunting the Avatar anymore.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.430
The mission is off.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.310
I'm ordering you to stop.

16:53.510 --> 16:54.720
( GRUNTS )

16:58.140 --> 16:59.940
If you keep attacking, I won't pay you.

17:00.690 --> 17:04.570
( GRUNTS ) All right,
I'll pay you double to stop.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.370
( GRUNTS )

17:53.200 --> 17:54.200
( ROARS )

18:08.670 --> 18:12.760
He's going to blast this whole
place right off the cliffside.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.390
( EXPLOSION )

18:16.100 --> 18:19.310
I can't step out to waterbend at him
without getting blown up.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.980
And I can't get a good enough
angle on him from down here.

18:23.150 --> 18:25.860
I know how to get an angle on him.

18:41.710 --> 18:44.830
All right, buddy, don't fail me now.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.760
( GRUNTS )

18:55.300 --> 18:58.640
Yeah, boomerang!

19:02.930 --> 19:06.360
Aw, boomerang...

19:12.440 --> 19:13.450
( GRUNTS )

19:36.260 --> 19:38.260
( GRUNTS )

19:48.110 --> 19:51.400
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but thanks, Zuko.

19:51.610 --> 19:52.860
Hey, and what about me?

19:52.940 --> 19:54.280
I did the boomerang thing.

19:54.530 --> 19:58.070
Listen, I know I didn't explain
myself very well yesterday.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.160
I've been through a lot in the past
few years, and it's been hard.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.250
But I'm realizing that I had to
go through all those things

20:05.330 --> 20:07.170
to learn the truth.

20:07.250 --> 20:11.670
I thought I had lost my honor and that
somehow my father could return it to me.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.840
But I know now that no one can
give you your honor.

20:15.090 --> 20:18.470
It's something you earn for yourself
by choosing to do what's right.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.010
All I want now is to play
my part in ending this war.

20:22.220 --> 20:26.390
And I know my destiny is
to help you restore balance to the world.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.860
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

20:29.940 --> 20:31.480
It was an accident.

20:31.570 --> 20:33.820
Fire can be dangerous and wild.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.820
So as a firebender, I need to be more
careful and control my bending

20:37.900 --> 20:40.660
so I don't hurt people unintentionally.

20:42.530 --> 20:45.620
I think you are supposed to be
my firebending teacher.

20:45.870 --> 20:49.830
When I first tried to learn
firebending, I burned Katara.

20:50.330 --> 20:53.880
And after that, I never wanted
to firebend again.

20:54.920 --> 20:59.010
But now I know you understand how easy
it is to hurt the people you love.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.890
I'd like you to teach me.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.180
Thank you.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.850
I'm so happy you've accepted me
into your group.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.650
AANG: Not so fast.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.150
I still have to ask my friends
if it's OK with them.

21:14.780 --> 21:17.150
Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.950
What do you think?

21:20.030 --> 21:22.030
Go ahead and let him join.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.950
It'll give me plenty of time
to get back at him for burning my feet.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.950
Sokka?

21:28.790 --> 21:31.710
Hey, all I want is to defeat
the Fire Lord.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.920
If you think this is the way to do it,
then I'm all for it.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.550
Katara?

21:45.310 --> 21:48.430
I'll go along with
whatever you think is right.

21:49.810 --> 21:52.230
I won't let you down, I promise.

22:03.070 --> 22:06.200
So here you go, home sweet home.

22:06.330 --> 22:07.700
I guess, you know, for now.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.750
Unpack... Lunch soon.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.960
Uh... Welcome aboard?

22:16.920 --> 22:18.210
Yeah.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.050
OK, this is really, really weird.

22:30.850 --> 22:35.690
If I have to, I will spend every day of
the rest of my life hunting the Avatar.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.190
I know it's my destiny to capture him.

22:38.280 --> 22:42.530
You know, prince Zuko,
destiny is a funny thing.

22:43.030 --> 22:46.370
You never know how things
are going to work out

22:46.580 --> 22:50.370
but if you keep an open mind
and an open heart

22:50.950 --> 22:54.750
I promise you will find
your own destiny someday.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.850
KATARA: You might have everyone else here
buying your transformation.

23:07.180 --> 23:10.890
But you and I both know you've struggled
with doing the right thing in the past.

23:11.060 --> 23:14.390
So let me tell you something right now.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.270
You make one step backward, one slip-up,

23:17.360 --> 23:19.900
give me one reason
to think you might hurt Aang

23:20.110 --> 23:22.780
and you won't have to worry
about your destiny anymore

23:23.150 --> 23:26.910
because I'll make sure your destiny
ends right then and there...

23:27.280 --> 23:29.870
Permanently.
