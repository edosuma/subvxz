MAN: <i>Previously on</i> Avatar...

00:49.470 --> 00:52.100
You and Sokka have to go
with Aang somewhere safe.

00:52.430 --> 00:54.890
It's the only way to keep hope alive.

00:54.970 --> 00:58.480
I'm going to join the Avatar,
and I'm going to help him defeat you.

00:58.690 --> 01:02.520
Since you're a full-blown traitor now
and you want me gone, why wait?

01:02.860 --> 01:04.940
Because I know my own destiny.

01:05.020 --> 01:07.400
Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.

where we'll be safe for a while.

( MOMO CHATTERING )

01:36.930 --> 01:38.180
This is humiliating.

01:38.270 --> 01:40.440
Do you mean getting thoroughly
spanked by the Fire Nation

01:40.560 --> 01:43.350
or having to walk all the way
to the Western Air Temple?

01:43.650 --> 01:45.110
Both.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.150
Sorry, guys, but Appa gets tired
carrying all these people.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.240
I wonder how the rest of the troops are.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.530
They're probably on their way to a prison.

01:55.620 --> 01:58.790
Seems like my dad just got out,
now he's going back in.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.710
I miss Pipsqueak.

I miss not having blisters on my feet.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.130
Hey, we're here.

02:08.210 --> 02:09.920
I can feel it.

02:10.010 --> 02:13.970
KATARA: Uh, I think your feet
need their eyes checked.

02:14.970 --> 02:18.390
No, she's right, we are here.

02:20.980 --> 02:24.230

02:59.680 --> 03:02.640
IROH: What a stunning view.

03:02.980 --> 03:07.110
The only view I'm interested in seeing is
the Avatar in chains.

03:07.310 --> 03:12.070
You know, the Avatar hasn't been
seen for 100 years.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.610
The chances of finding him here
are very slim.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.780
First, we'll check each of
the air temples.

03:18.870 --> 03:20.080
Then we'll scour the world,

03:20.160 --> 03:22.790
searching even the most remote locations
until we find him.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.290
Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since
your banishment.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.000
You should take some time
to heal and rest.

03:32.090 --> 03:35.340
What else would I expect to hear from
the laziest man in the Fire Nation?

03:36.840 --> 03:38.470
( SIGHS )

03:38.800 --> 03:42.060
The only way to regain my honor
is to find the Avatar.

It's so different from
the Northern Air Temple.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.380
I wonder if there are any secret rooms.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.000
Let's go check it out.

04:18.340 --> 04:21.680
You guys go...
I think we need to talk about some things.

04:22.970 --> 04:24.600
I'll race you, Duke.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.560
I told you, it's "The Duke."

04:27.640 --> 04:28.640
Why can't I go?

04:28.810 --> 04:31.020
We need to decide what we're gonna do now

04:31.150 --> 04:34.030
And since you're the Avatar,
maybe you should be a part of this.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.610
Fair enough.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.780
So what's the new plan?

04:39.990 --> 04:44.620
Well, if you ask me,
the new plan is the old plan.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.700
You just need to master all four elements

04:46.790 --> 04:48.960
and confront the Fire Lord
before the comet comes.

04:49.170 --> 04:53.840
Oh, yeah, that's great,
no problem, I'll just do that.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.300
Aang, no one said it's gonna be easy.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.420
Well, it's not even gonna be possible.

04:58.510 --> 05:01.010
Where am I supposed to get
a firebending teacher?

05:02.180 --> 05:03.720
We could look for Jeong Jeong.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.020
Yeah, right.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.430
Like we'll ever run into
Jeong Jeong again.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.900
Who's... Oh, never mind.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.900
If it's important, I'll find out.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.980
Oh, well, guess we can't
come up with anybody.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.860
Why don't we just take a nice
tour around the temple?

05:22.370 --> 05:23.700
TOPH: What's up with him?

05:25.160 --> 05:28.160
There's got to be someone
who can teach him firebending.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.170
Hello, Zuko here.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.460
But I guess you probably already
know me... Sort of.

05:37.590 --> 05:42.010
Uh, so, the thing is,
I have a lot of firebending experience

05:42.090 --> 05:44.390
and I'm considered to be
pretty good at it.

05:44.550 --> 05:47.680
Well, you've seen me...
You know, when I was attacking you?

05:48.140 --> 05:50.730
Uh, yeah, I guess I should
apologize for that.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.690
But anyway, I'm good now.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.690
I mean, I thought I was good before,
but now I realize I was bad.

05:56.020 --> 06:00.070
But anyway...
I think it's time I joined your group

would trust you, can you?

hunt us down and capture Aang.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.480
I've done some good things.

Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.

That's something.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.450
Appa does seem to like him.

08:53.530 --> 08:56.750
He probably just covered himself in honey
or something so that Appa would lick him.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.330
I'm not buying it.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.040
I can understand why you wouldn't trust me

mistakes in the past.

used it to track us down and capture us?

the Water Tribe.

Fire Nation assassin after you.

insult your friend.

after them?

fool us like that?

lead us into some kind of trap.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.500
KATARA: This is just like when we were in
prison together in Ba Sing Se.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.670
He starts talking about his mother

11:06.750 --> 11:08.790
and making it seem like he's
an actual human being with feelings.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.760
He wants you to trust him
and feel sorry for him

11:11.840 --> 11:14.680
so you let your guard down,
then he strikes.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.760
The thing is, it worked.

11:17.850 --> 11:19.510
I did feel sorry for him.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.430
I felt like he was really
confused and hurt.

11:22.770 --> 11:25.810
But obviously when the time came
he made his choice

11:26.020 --> 11:28.020
and we paid the price.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.190
We can't trust him.

11:30.270 --> 11:31.900
AANG: I kind of have a confession to make.

11:32.230 --> 11:34.900
Remember when you two were sick
and I got captured by Zhao?

11:35.110 --> 11:36.860
And you made us suck on frozen frogs?

11:36.950 --> 11:38.620
How could I forget?

11:38.700 --> 11:42.490
I had a wart on the flap that hangs down
from the back of my throat for a month.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.870
Sokka, I looked at it and told you
there was nothing there.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.920
I could feel it...
It's my throatal flap.

11:50.340 --> 11:54.550
AANG: Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up,
it was Zuko who came in and got me out.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.680
He risked his life to save me.

11:56.880 --> 12:00.680
No way, I'm sure he only did it
so he could capture you himself.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.180
Yeah, face it, Aang,
you're nothing but a big prize to him.

12:03.270 --> 12:05.100
You're probably right.

12:05.180 --> 12:07.560
And what was all that crazy
stuff about setting Appa free?

12:07.650 --> 12:09.610
What a liar.

12:09.690 --> 12:10.730
Actually, he wasn't lying.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.400
Oh, hooray.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.240
In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't
add animal cruelty to the list.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.580
I'm just saying that considering his
messed-up family and how he was raised

12:21.740 --> 12:23.910
he could've turned out a lot worse.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.250
You're right, Toph, let's go
find him and give him a medal...

12:27.370 --> 12:30.330
The "not as much of a jerk
as you could've been" award.

12:30.670 --> 12:34.710
All I know is that while he was
talking to us, he was sincere.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.590
Maybe you're all just letting your hurt
feelings keep you from thinking clearly.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.300
Easy for you to say, you weren't there
when he had us attacked by pirates.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.640
Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.100
Or when he tried to capture me
at the Fire Temple.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.810
Why would you even try to defend him?

12:49.900 --> 12:54.020
Because, Katara, you're all
ignoring one crucial fact.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.690
Aang needs a firebending teacher.

12:56.780 --> 12:59.200
We can't think of a single person in
the world to do the job.

12:59.660 --> 13:03.370
Now one shows upon a silver platter and
you won't even think about it?

13:06.500 --> 13:09.670
I'm not having Zuko as my teacher.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.420
You're darn right you're not, buddy.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.420
Well, I guess that's settled.

13:14.130 --> 13:17.760
( GROANS ) I'm beginning to wonder
who's really the blind one around here.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.640
( LEAVES RUSTLING )

13:26.850 --> 13:29.310
Who's there?

13:29.390 --> 13:30.390
Stay back.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.850
It's me!

13:32.060 --> 13:33.810
Ow!

13:35.730 --> 13:37.230
You burned my feet.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.400
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

13:40.030 --> 13:42.030
Get away from me.

13:45.330 --> 13:46.910
Let me help you.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.750
I'm sorry.

13:49.910 --> 13:52.210
Get off me, get off me.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.630
( GRUNTS )

13:55.040 --> 13:57.550
I didn't know it was you.
( GROANS )

13:57.760 --> 13:59.380
Come back!

14:01.340 --> 14:02.760
( GROANS )

14:02.840 --> 14:05.510
Why am I so bad at being good?

14:16.650 --> 14:18.570
Has anyone seen Toph?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.860
I haven't seen her
since she stormed off yesterday.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.030
Maybe she's just exploring the Air Temple.

14:23.110 --> 14:26.120
There are some pretty fun spots
to practice earthbending.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.580
I think we should go look for her.

14:28.790 --> 14:30.700
Oh, let her have fun with her rocks.

14:30.790 --> 14:32.660
I'm in no rush to have her
yelling at us again.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.130
We can go check for her.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.920
Yeah, I want to ride that tunnel down
to the hall of statues again.

14:38.050 --> 14:41.260
It'll work a lot better now that I fixed
my brakes.

14:44.760 --> 14:49.260
( CRASH )

14:49.350 --> 14:50.850
( GRUNTING )

14:51.180 --> 14:52.810
KATARA: Toph, what happened?

14:52.940 --> 14:54.310
My feet got burned.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.520
Oh, no, what happened?

14:56.690 --> 14:59.980
I just told you, my feet got burned.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.030
I meant how.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.490
Well, I kind of went to see Zuko
last night.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.820
You what?

15:05.910 --> 15:07.490
- Zuko?
-( GASPS )

15:07.570 --> 15:09.580
I just thought he could be helpful to us

15:09.660 --> 15:12.750
and if I talked to him,
maybe we could work something out.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.500
So he attacked you?

15:14.750 --> 15:17.040
Well, he did and he didn't.

15:17.130 --> 15:19.290
It was sort of an accident.

15:19.550 --> 15:20.880
But he did firebend at you?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.380
( SIGHS ) Yes.

15:23.510 --> 15:27.970
See, you trusted Zuko and
you got burned... Literally.

15:28.050 --> 15:30.310
It's gonna take a while
for your feet to get better.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.970
I wish I could've worked on them sooner.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.810
Yeah, me too.

15:33.890 --> 15:36.060
Zuko's clearly too dangerous
to be left alone.

15:36.350 --> 15:37.940
We're gonna have to go after him.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.440
I hate to go looking for
a fight, but you're right.

15:40.610 --> 15:44.030
After what he did to Toph,
I don't think we have a choice.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.280
He's crafty, but we'll find
a way to capture him.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.530
TOPH: Maybe just invite him back here.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.450
He's already offered himself up
as a prisoner once.

15:51.540 --> 15:55.370
Yeah... Get him to come back
and say he'll be our prisoner

15:55.580 --> 15:58.460
then we'll jump him and really
make him our prisoner.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.340
He'll never suspect it.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.630
You are a master of surprise, Sokka.

16:05.170 --> 16:07.630
Ahh, that's the stuff.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.970
Now I know how the rest of you guys feel.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.100
Not being able to see
with your feet stinks.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.250
( GRUNTS )

16:44.130 --> 16:45.710
ZUKO: Stop!

16:45.960 --> 16:49.890
I don't want you
hunting the Avatar anymore.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.430
The mission is off.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.310
I'm ordering you to stop.

16:53.510 --> 16:54.720
( GRUNTS )

16:58.140 --> 16:59.940
If you keep attacking, I won't pay you.

17:00.690 --> 17:04.570
( GRUNTS ) All right,
I'll pay you double to stop.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.370
( GRUNTS )

17:53.200 --> 17:54.200
( ROARS )

18:08.670 --> 18:12.760
He's going to blast this whole
place right off the cliffside.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.390
( EXPLOSION )

18:16.100 --> 18:19.310
I can't step out to waterbend at him
without getting blown up.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.980
And I can't get a good enough
angle on him from down here.

18:23.150 --> 18:25.860
I know how to get an angle on him.

18:41.710 --> 18:44.830
All right, buddy, don't fail me now.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.760
( GRUNTS )

18:55.300 --> 18:58.640
Yeah, boomerang!

19:02.930 --> 19:06.360
Aw, boomerang...

19:12.440 --> 19:13.450
( GRUNTS )

19:36.260 --> 19:38.260
( GRUNTS )

19:48.110 --> 19:51.400
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but thanks, Zuko.

19:51.610 --> 19:52.860
Hey, and what about me?

19:52.940 --> 19:54.280
I did the boomerang thing.

19:54.530 --> 19:58.070
Listen, I know I didn't explain
myself very well yesterday.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.160
I've been through a lot in the past
few years, and it's been hard.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.250
But I'm realizing that I had to
go through all those things

20:05.330 --> 20:07.170
to learn the truth.

20:07.250 --> 20:11.670
I thought I had lost my honor and that
somehow my father could return it to me.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.840
But I know now that no one can
give you your honor.

20:15.090 --> 20:18.470
It's something you earn for yourself
by choosing to do what's right.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.010
All I want now is to play
my part in ending this war.

20:22.220 --> 20:26.390
And I know my destiny is
to help you restore balance to the world.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.860
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

20:29.940 --> 20:31.480
It was an accident.

20:31.570 --> 20:33.820
Fire can be dangerous and wild.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.820
So as a firebender, I need to be more
careful and control my bending

20:37.900 --> 20:40.660
so I don't hurt people unintentionally.

20:42.530 --> 20:45.620
I think you are supposed to be
my firebending teacher.

20:45.870 --> 20:49.830
When I first tried to learn
firebending, I burned Katara.

20:50.330 --> 20:53.880
And after that, I never wanted
to firebend again.

20:54.920 --> 20:59.010
But now I know you understand how easy
it is to hurt the people you love.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.890
I'd like you to teach me.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.180
Thank you.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.850
I'm so happy you've accepted me
into your group.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.650
AANG: Not so fast.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.150
I still have to ask my friends
if it's OK with them.

21:14.780 --> 21:17.150
Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.950
What do you think?

21:20.030 --> 21:22.030
Go ahead and let him join.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.950
It'll give me plenty of time
to get back at him for burning my feet.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.950
Sokka?

21:28.790 --> 21:31.710
Hey, all I want is to defeat
the Fire Lord.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.920
If you think this is the way to do it,
then I'm all for it.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.550
Katara?

21:45.310 --> 21:48.430
I'll go along with
whatever you think is right.

21:49.810 --> 21:52.230
I won't let you down, I promise.

22:03.070 --> 22:06.200
So here you go, home sweet home.

22:06.330 --> 22:07.700
I guess, you know, for now.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.750
Unpack... Lunch soon.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.960
Uh... Welcome aboard?

22:16.920 --> 22:18.210
Yeah.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.050
OK, this is really, really weird.

22:30.850 --> 22:35.690
If I have to, I will spend every day of
the rest of my life hunting the Avatar.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.190
I know it's my destiny to capture him.

22:38.280 --> 22:42.530
You know, prince Zuko,
destiny is a funny thing.

22:43.030 --> 22:46.370
You never know how things
are going to work out

22:46.580 --> 22:50.370
but if you keep an open mind
and an open heart

22:50.950 --> 22:54.750
I promise you will find
your own destiny someday.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.850
KATARA: You might have everyone else here
buying your transformation.

23:07.180 --> 23:10.890
But you and I both know you've struggled
with doing the right thing in the past.

23:11.060 --> 23:14.390
So let me tell you something right now.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.270
You make one step backward, one slip-up,

23:17.360 --> 23:19.900
give me one reason
to think you might hurt Aang

23:20.110 --> 23:22.780
and you won't have to worry
about your destiny anymore

23:23.150 --> 23:26.910
because I'll make sure your destiny
ends right then and there...

23:27.280 --> 23:29.870
Permanently.

23:44.630 --> 23:47.340
( â™ª... )
