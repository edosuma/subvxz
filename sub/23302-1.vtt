03:06.364 --> 03:07.196
Chicken's almost done.

03:07.198 --> 03:08.946
Mom?

03:08.948 --> 03:10.738
I'll start preparing
the salad if you like?

03:10.740 --> 03:12.196
Sure, that'd be
great Margaret.

03:12.198 --> 03:13.739
I'll get you a few
things for it.

03:13.741 --> 03:15.697
Mom, I'm hungry.

03:15.699 --> 03:17.405
We'll eat soon,
Jennifer, okay,

03:17.407 --> 03:18.572
as soon as your
father gets here.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.739
Thank you.

03:20.741 --> 03:22.364
Do you think we've
got enough beer?

03:22.366 --> 03:24.157
He won't want beer
when he gets home.

03:24.159 --> 03:26.157
He's gonna need whiskey.

03:26.159 --> 03:28.198
Now, David, don't go
getting Christopher drunk now.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.991
Why not? He's on shore leave,

03:29.993 --> 03:32.034
he can do whatever he wants.

03:32.036 --> 03:33.784
I hope he'll wanna spend
time with his family.

03:33.786 --> 03:35.618
What about John?

03:35.620 --> 03:37.243
Is he planning on
showing up tonight?

03:37.245 --> 03:40.119
John? Planning something?

03:40.121 --> 03:41.827
There's a new one.

03:41.829 --> 03:43.244
Well, maybe you
should give him a call.

03:43.246 --> 03:44.411
He'll wanna be here.

03:44.413 --> 03:45.953
I've tried three
times already.

03:45.955 --> 03:46.787
He never answers.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.537
I'll try again.

05:00.884 --> 05:01.925
Really?

05:02.759 --> 05:05.091
Hey bro, good game.

05:05.093 --> 05:06.384
Thanks dude.

05:06.386 --> 05:07.675
Although, I think
you take this shit

05:07.677 --> 05:09.801
a little too seriously, man.

05:09.803 --> 05:11.301
It's just street football.

05:14.305 --> 05:17.719
That's because we're
the best, brah.

05:17.721 --> 05:19.177
You guys are delusional.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.719
Yeah, street football
is like our thing.

05:24.721 --> 05:26.721
Unlike people running
you down like that.

05:26.723 --> 05:29.055
He's just jealous,
dude, forget about it.

05:29.057 --> 05:31.180
So, I take it you
guys play a lot?

05:31.182 --> 05:32.846
Oh yeah, all the time.

05:32.848 --> 05:35.139
We're like backyard
champions of LA.

05:36.975 --> 05:39.473
Yeah, from Glendale all
the way down to Long Beach.

05:39.475 --> 05:42.140
Past Long Beach,
bro, way past.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.390
Yeah, but we're unstoppable.

05:44.392 --> 05:46.265
John here, he's our
secret weapon.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.642
Who's on the barbecue?

05:53.644 --> 05:54.767
It smells awesome.

05:58.437 --> 05:59.810
He's drunk.

05:59.812 --> 06:01.310
Well, it's good
to have skills.

06:01.312 --> 06:02.601
What, drinking?

06:02.603 --> 06:03.519
He's really good at that.

06:03.521 --> 06:04.728
No, I mean...

06:04.730 --> 06:06.228
I think it's his last drawing.

06:06.230 --> 06:09.144
I have skills too, by the way.

06:09.146 --> 06:11.771
Really? You mean besides
running with a ball?

06:11.773 --> 06:13.396
Oh.

06:13.398 --> 06:15.355
I'm sorry.

06:15.357 --> 06:17.938
That's fair, kind of.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.188
What other skills do you have?

06:20.190 --> 06:21.440
I fix things.

06:21.442 --> 06:24.397
Really? Like what?

06:24.399 --> 06:26.315
Anything, stuff
around the house,

06:26.317 --> 06:28.231
plumbing, motorbikes.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.815
I just spent a month
up at Big Sur

06:29.817 --> 06:31.942
helping a guy build
a pizza oven.

06:31.944 --> 06:33.358
It took a month to
build a pizza oven?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.608
Man, this thing was huge.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.817
You could fit like
five pizzas at once.

06:36.819 --> 06:39.483
Plus, I had a lot
of cervezas, okay.

06:39.485 --> 06:40.401
I'm a busy man.

06:43.278 --> 06:46.151
Actually, you know what?

06:46.153 --> 06:48.820
I think I might need
something fixed.

06:48.822 --> 06:50.360
Really?

06:50.362 --> 06:52.194
Yeah, my truck,
there is this noise.

06:54.738 --> 06:56.486
Your truck has a noise?

06:56.488 --> 06:57.361
Yeah.

07:00.699 --> 07:02.947
I think I should
come around some time

07:02.949 --> 07:03.822
and take a look at your truck.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.488
What are you doin' tomorrow?

07:05.490 --> 07:06.613
Well...

07:06.615 --> 07:07.947
Is this your phone, dude?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.406
Yeah.

07:09.408 --> 07:10.656
It's been ringing
all afternoon.

07:10.658 --> 07:11.490
Hello.

07:14.283 --> 07:17.158
Hey! Where are you going?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.783
I have to go.

07:18.785 --> 07:20.366
I'll call you tomorrow.

07:24.369 --> 07:26.034
He's always doing that.

07:26.036 --> 07:28.034
But I didn't give
him my number.

07:28.036 --> 07:30.202
Oh, I'll give you his number.

07:30.204 --> 07:31.076
Good.

07:32.663 --> 07:34.286
'Cause I really need
my truck fixed.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.369
Sure.

08:58.135 --> 09:00.175
Despite what you've
seen in the movies,

09:00.177 --> 09:01.926
traveling through
space is not the same

09:01.928 --> 09:05.094
as driving down the I-95,

09:05.096 --> 09:07.761
where the speed limit's
more of a suggestion

09:07.763 --> 09:09.469
than an actual limit.

09:09.471 --> 09:11.512
The speed of light is it.

09:11.514 --> 09:13.262
Nothing moves faster.

09:13.264 --> 09:15.262
Even at that speed it
would take decades

09:15.264 --> 09:18.262
to reach our closest neighbors.

09:18.264 --> 09:20.846
For now, we're stuck
here on this rock, Earth.

09:23.057 --> 09:25.805
Boring.

09:25.807 --> 09:27.098
Well, let's not
forget that this boring

09:27.100 --> 09:29.806
little planet is home.

09:29.808 --> 09:31.806
It looks pretty small from here,

09:31.808 --> 09:35.474
but it holds everything
in your life.

09:35.476 --> 09:38.516
Your family, your friends,
everything you've ever known,

09:38.518 --> 09:39.975
everything you wanna be.

09:42.602 --> 09:45.517
It's all we've got, so take
care of it, protect it.

09:52.312 --> 09:53.643
Hey Tracy!

09:53.645 --> 09:55.435
Hi!

09:55.437 --> 09:58.020
Ugh! I am so glad
this week's over.

09:58.022 --> 09:59.895
Wait, you actually
have weekends?

09:59.897 --> 10:01.771
I know I should
be researching,

10:01.773 --> 10:04.063
but it's so hard.

10:04.065 --> 10:05.771
You know, Melissa,
you don't actually

10:05.773 --> 10:06.855
have to go to every
party you're invited to.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.355
I know.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.939
Actually speaking of parties,

10:09.941 --> 10:10.814
what are your plans
this weekend?

10:10.816 --> 10:12.565
Well, if you must know,

10:12.567 --> 10:13.647
I'm going on a date tonight.

10:13.649 --> 10:14.940
A date!

10:14.942 --> 10:17.522
I thought I was the one
having too much fun.

10:17.524 --> 10:18.898
Who's the lucky guy?

10:18.900 --> 10:21.483
I, I kind of met him online.

10:21.485 --> 10:22.690
It's probably gonna
be a total disaster.

10:22.692 --> 10:23.900
No, don't say that.

10:23.902 --> 10:25.525
Online dating is totally fine.

10:25.527 --> 10:26.858
Ever normal people are
doing it these days.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.566
Wow, you're really filling me

10:28.568 --> 10:30.234
with confidence right
now, thanks Mel.

10:30.236 --> 10:31.443
Look, if he turns
out to be a jerk,

10:31.445 --> 10:32.734
I'm having some
people over tomorrow,

10:32.736 --> 10:34.486
you should totally come.

10:34.488 --> 10:36.361
We'll drink champagne,
we can laugh about it,

10:36.363 --> 10:38.276
and then by mid afternoon
you'll be too drunk to care.

10:44.989 --> 10:46.738
Hello! Earth to Ms. Gleeson.

10:46.740 --> 10:47.571
Sorry.

10:49.322 --> 10:50.653
So, you're thinking of
joining the army now?

10:50.655 --> 10:51.988
Seriously?

10:51.990 --> 10:54.321
Lunch tomorrow sounds good.

10:54.323 --> 10:55.780
Good, because I
bought this new dress,

10:55.782 --> 10:57.573
and I'm not sure but
I think Ill wear it.

10:57.575 --> 10:58.948
It's just the
perfect little cut.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.573
It's got this heart shape here.

11:04.826 --> 11:06.156
We should stop for
a seismic, Stan.

11:06.158 --> 11:07.617
Yeah, we just did.

11:07.619 --> 11:08.617
We're runnin' out of time.

11:08.619 --> 11:11.867
We need to reach the objective.

11:11.869 --> 11:13.243
Remember what Jackson said,

11:13.245 --> 11:15.118
measure stealth not speed.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.783
And keep your mouth shut.

12:33.924 --> 12:34.756
You want more gravy?

12:37.926 --> 12:38.758
Chris?

12:40.009 --> 12:40.841
- What?
- Gravy?

12:44.010 --> 12:45.049
No, thank you.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.800
Uncle John!

12:47.802 --> 12:49.175
Hey!

12:49.177 --> 12:50.509
Argh! Sorry I'm late.

12:52.136 --> 12:54.011
I had a bunch of errands to run.

12:54.013 --> 12:55.511
Thanks for coming, John.

12:57.803 --> 12:59.510
It's good to see ya' buddy!

13:02.929 --> 13:05.219
Give your damn
brother a hug, Chris.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.513
It's good
to have you back.

13:12.515 --> 13:13.554
Thanks.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.597
I hear you made Lieutenant.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.140
I thought you might
want these to celebrate.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.225
Thanks, man.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.350
Come and eat, John.

13:32.352 --> 13:33.350
There's plenty left.

13:33.352 --> 13:34.517
Smells awesome, thanks.

13:34.519 --> 13:35.558
Hey!

13:39.854 --> 13:40.852
Chicken, potatoes.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.478
Great!

13:43.480 --> 13:45.895
So, have you been keeping
yourself busy, John?

13:45.897 --> 13:47.270
Yeah, ever since
I came back to LA,

13:47.272 --> 13:49.811
it's just been nonstop.

13:49.813 --> 13:51.396
Been fixin' up this guy's
kitchen for the past week.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.478
Plumbing, is it?

13:52.480 --> 13:54.522
Carpentry mostly.

13:54.524 --> 13:57.022
Bench tops, cabinet
doors, that kind of thing.

13:57.024 --> 13:59.064
He wants to turn the house
into a bed and breakfast,

13:59.066 --> 14:00.314
you know, one of those
internet things.

14:00.316 --> 14:01.855
Internet things?

14:01.857 --> 14:03.730
Yeah, don't ask
me how it works,

14:03.732 --> 14:05.523
but a bunch of my
friends are doing it.

14:05.525 --> 14:07.690
Well, it's a great achievement
owning your own home,

14:07.692 --> 14:10.275
something you could aspire to.

14:10.277 --> 14:12.983
Sure, I'll just wait
for the 1940s to come back

14:12.985 --> 14:14.858
so I could afford it.

14:14.860 --> 14:16.901
Well, things ain't
what they used to be,

14:16.903 --> 14:19.441
but when Margaret and
I bought our first home

14:19.443 --> 14:21.526
up in Granada Hills there
was almost nothing there.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.192
And it was cheap land too.

14:26.779 --> 14:27.860
Excuse me.

15:07.245 --> 15:08.785
Good evening.

15:08.787 --> 15:09.910
Do you have a booking tonight?

15:09.912 --> 15:10.951
Yeah...

15:12.913 --> 15:16.076
I'm with that guy,
I think, sort of?

15:16.078 --> 15:17.743
That's fine, go on through.

15:21.998 --> 15:22.829
Byron?

15:25.081 --> 15:27.329
- Yes, Tracy.
- That's me.

15:27.331 --> 15:28.496
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.

15:30.374 --> 15:32.622
No, it's fine,
take a seat, please.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.414
So, have you looked
at the menu, or...

15:41.375 --> 15:42.956
Yeah, yeah, it looks good.

15:45.585 --> 15:47.583
That's the wine list though.

15:47.585 --> 15:50.001
Oh, of course, right.

15:53.003 --> 15:55.502
Good evening, how are you?

15:55.504 --> 15:56.877
Can I get you two anything
to drink to start off?

15:56.879 --> 15:58.752
Yeah, wine please.

15:58.754 --> 15:59.752
Merlot.

15:59.754 --> 16:00.795
Sure, a glass?

16:00.797 --> 16:01.836
Bottle.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.752
Did you want somethin'
to drink, or?

16:07.839 --> 16:11.337
Maybe we could
share the Merlot?

16:11.339 --> 16:14.338
Great idea, two
glasses please.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.213
Sure.

16:15.215 --> 16:16.254
Thank you.

16:18.049 --> 16:20.047
Sorry, I'm nervous.

16:20.049 --> 16:22.964
That's fine, just relax.

16:22.966 --> 16:24.882
I know, I know, I'll be fine.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.049
Merlot's coming.

16:26.051 --> 16:26.882
Hmm.

16:44.011 --> 16:46.676
You're not gonna bail
on me now, are ya'?

17:20.059 --> 17:23.476
I don't know what
you've been through,

17:23.478 --> 17:25.851
but it's good to have
you back, Brother.

17:30.104 --> 17:31.061
I'm not back.

17:35.189 --> 17:36.269
Not really.

17:50.191 --> 17:51.398
Okay, I understand that,

17:51.400 --> 17:53.105
but it's just straight logic.

17:55.232 --> 17:56.981
If there are infinite universes

17:56.983 --> 17:59.856
with infinite variations
then somewhere

17:59.858 --> 18:02.357
there must be a universe
that's just like ours

18:02.359 --> 18:04.316
with a galaxy just like ours,

18:04.318 --> 18:07.859
even the same planet Earth,

18:07.861 --> 18:10.734
even the same us at a
restaurant drinking

18:10.736 --> 18:11.818
too much red wine.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.943
Just 'cause it seems
logical doesn't make it true.

18:17.945 --> 18:19.194
We can't even do
tests to find out

18:19.196 --> 18:22.194
if there are actually
parallel universes.

18:22.196 --> 18:23.694
But what about CERN?

18:23.696 --> 18:26.653
CERN hasn't proven anything.

18:26.655 --> 18:28.446
It's pointless just
even talkin' about this.

18:28.448 --> 18:31.697
We might as well be
discussing astrology.

18:31.699 --> 18:32.572
Okay, fine.

18:34.824 --> 18:36.655
What would you like
to talk about then?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.030
I don't know, astrology.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.282
You're not enjoying
this are you?

18:44.284 --> 18:45.115
I'm sorry.

18:47.451 --> 18:50.865
I'm probably just tired.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.575
I spend all day talkin'
about this stuff,

18:53.577 --> 18:55.826
and to be honest I'm
kind of over it.

18:57.994 --> 19:00.201
Can we just get the
check, please?

19:00.203 --> 19:01.284
Sure.

19:03.496 --> 19:07.536
Excuse me, can we have
the check please?

19:07.538 --> 19:08.703
The president has
promised to continue

19:08.705 --> 19:09.911
the mission in Northern
Africa for as long

19:09.913 --> 19:12.620
as it takes to secure peace.

19:12.622 --> 19:15.330
Despite American casualties
now numbering over 5,000,

19:15.332 --> 19:17.121
and many soldiers
returning from the region

19:17.123 --> 19:19.288
will face years of
rehabilitation,

19:19.290 --> 19:21.872
both physically and
psychologically.

19:21.874 --> 19:23.456
Can you believe people
are actually signing up

19:23.458 --> 19:25.081
to fight in this stupid war?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.707
Anyone dumb enough to
enlist in the military

19:29.709 --> 19:32.665
deserves what's coming to them.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.458
Maybe some things
aren't that simple.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.709
War is stupid.

19:37.711 --> 19:39.624
It seems pretty simple to me.

19:39.626 --> 19:41.709
Can we not talk
about this, please?

19:42.877 --> 19:43.710
Sure.

22:36.242 --> 22:37.281
Good work.

22:38.034 --> 22:39.074
Thanks.

23:18.959 --> 23:21.498
That's our objective.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.624
How are we supposed
to get up there?

23:23.626 --> 23:25.708
We'll crawl from
the northwest.

23:25.710 --> 23:28.000
But for now, we need to place
to hold off for the night.

23:28.002 --> 23:30.792
Any idea what those are?

23:30.794 --> 23:33.084
Old forts from the war?

23:33.086 --> 23:33.916
The last one.

23:35.420 --> 23:36.710
Let's check it out.

24:00.924 --> 24:01.964
Mai Tai?

24:02.259 --> 24:04.007
What?

24:04.009 --> 24:06.257
I can't drink both
of these myself.

24:07.675 --> 24:08.508
Sure.

24:12.301 --> 24:13.134
Thanks.

24:16.344 --> 24:17.467
Damn, it's hot.

24:17.469 --> 24:19.718
Yeah.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.093
I think there's a
thunderstorm coming, though.

24:21.095 --> 24:23.677
Yeah, I heard thunder.

24:23.679 --> 24:27.219
So, how's it lookin'?

24:27.221 --> 24:29.469
It's looking really good.

24:29.471 --> 24:31.136
I meant the car.

24:31.138 --> 24:33.094
Oh, the car, right.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.970
Yeah, it's gonna
need a lot of work.

24:35.972 --> 24:38.138
I might have to
clear my schedule.

24:43.098 --> 24:44.139
Dude, I'm sorry,

24:44.141 --> 24:46.015
I'm gonna have to
stop you there.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.347
There was a report
coming in of some kind

24:47.349 --> 24:50.891
of attack in the South Pacific.

24:50.893 --> 24:52.681
People are saying a
bunch of giant aircraft

24:52.683 --> 24:55.181
just appeared out of nowhere.

24:55.183 --> 24:57.100
They're like, not from Earth.

24:57.102 --> 24:59.100
What? Wow!

24:59.102 --> 25:00.350
Yeah!

25:00.352 --> 25:01.557
The president's about
to make an announcement.

25:04.978 --> 25:06.183
What we're
seeing now is video footage

25:06.185 --> 25:08.893
recorded just a few
hours ago in Manila,

25:08.895 --> 25:12.102
where the US Navy is engaged
in a full scale battle.

25:12.104 --> 25:13.977
This is truly astonishing
what we're seeing here.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.103
More reports are coming in from
all over the South Pacific.

25:16.105 --> 25:17.603
This is crazy.

25:17.605 --> 25:19.103
Parallel universes.

25:19.105 --> 25:20.812
What?

25:20.814 --> 25:21.937
Does anyone have
family on the West Coast?

25:21.939 --> 25:23.813
I have an aunt
in Santa Barbara,

25:23.815 --> 25:25.188
but this is happening
in the Philippines.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.854
It's just starting.

25:26.856 --> 25:28.021
Tell your aunt to head east,

25:28.023 --> 25:31.148
as far from the
Pacific as possible.

25:31.150 --> 25:32.855
But where are you going?

25:34.732 --> 25:36.938
I think I'm gonna
follow my brother.

25:40.026 --> 25:42.232
But didn't her brother die?

25:46.778 --> 25:48.359
I don't care, just any
flight heading northeast.

25:48.361 --> 25:49.401
- Mom, Mom...
- Toronto if possible.

25:49.403 --> 25:51.234
What's going on?

25:51.236 --> 25:54.610
David, no, carry on
will have you drawing.

25:54.612 --> 25:57.318
Sir, as soon as
my family is safe,

25:57.320 --> 25:58.986
I'll drive straight
to Pendleton.

25:58.988 --> 26:00.861
Chris, I can help.

26:00.863 --> 26:01.943
Just a second, sir.

26:03.780 --> 26:05.736
They want me back right away.

26:09.615 --> 26:11.404
I'll get 'em to the airport.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.197
You could trust me.

26:24.075 --> 26:26.115
I'll be there right away, sir.

26:28.410 --> 26:30.116
God damn, worse timing.

26:30.118 --> 26:31.616
Anne's car is in the shop,

26:31.618 --> 26:33.199
and I need mine to
get to the base.

26:33.201 --> 26:35.241
Can you take yours?

26:35.243 --> 26:37.410
Yeah, yeah, of course.

26:40.287 --> 26:41.242
I have to go.

26:43.828 --> 26:45.076
We've got a flight in
two and a half hours.

26:45.078 --> 26:47.745
You go, we'll be fine.

27:03.291 --> 27:04.955
Be good for your mom, okay.

27:13.292 --> 27:14.540
Watch your back, son.

27:16.294 --> 27:17.125
Always.

27:21.336 --> 27:23.168
Come on, my car's ready.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.875
Why don't you
come with us, John?

27:24.877 --> 27:26.251
I'm sure they'll be
room on the plane.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.251
I'm gonna stay.

27:28.253 --> 27:31.544
- Help out however I can.
- You're a good man, John.

27:34.005 --> 27:36.921
Come on, let's get some bags.

27:51.383 --> 27:52.297
- Everyone buckled up?
- Yes!

27:57.217 --> 27:58.841
You should take better
care of your car, John.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.507
The key's gettin' messy.

28:00.509 --> 28:01.924
John, we're gonna
miss the flight.

28:01.926 --> 28:03.507
Perhaps we should call a cab?

28:03.509 --> 28:05.633
No, I know someone
who could help.

28:11.636 --> 28:13.384
Yeah, I know we've
missed this flight,

28:13.386 --> 28:15.135
what I'm asking is if we
could get a connecting flight

28:15.137 --> 28:16.594
from somewhere else,
take this exit.

28:16.596 --> 28:18.344
I know, I've driven
to LAX before!

28:18.346 --> 28:20.010
I don't care, anywhere
around there will do.

28:20.012 --> 28:21.135
Greenland would be fine.

28:23.556 --> 28:25.054
- Montreal?
- Yeah.

28:25.056 --> 28:26.470
Yeah, yeah, Montreal.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.138
Great! Book that in!

28:29.140 --> 28:31.096
We're on our way, thank you.

28:33.891 --> 28:35.430
Hope you all can speak French,

28:35.432 --> 28:36.471
you're goin' to Montreal.

28:36.473 --> 28:37.890
That's wonderful,
thank you John.

28:37.892 --> 28:39.097
Is it a direct flight?

28:39.099 --> 28:40.265
Stop over in San Fran,

28:40.267 --> 28:42.265
but it's only an hour.

28:42.267 --> 28:44.016
We're saying ciao by nightfall.

28:44.018 --> 28:46.016
Well, that's Italian, John,

28:46.018 --> 28:48.475
- but thank you nonetheless.
- You're welcome.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.267
You're sure you
won't come with us.

28:50.269 --> 28:52.849
No, there's something
else I gotta do.

28:56.853 --> 28:58.268
Almost, they'll be fine.

29:01.145 --> 29:03.019
Chris, I gotta ask
you something...

29:04.939 --> 29:06.103
I want to enlist, bro.

29:08.396 --> 29:10.313
Tell me what I gotta do.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.031
Today...

30:16.326 --> 30:19.200
The sun rises on a new chapter
in our nation's history,

30:21.617 --> 30:24.200
and the history of every
nation in the world.

30:26.411 --> 30:27.241
Today...

30:30.203 --> 30:32.867
For the first time in
over half a century...

30:34.954 --> 30:35.952
Our world is at war.

30:44.998 --> 30:46.996
We are both extremely saddened

30:46.998 --> 30:49.037
by the death of your
family, Lieutenant.

30:49.039 --> 30:51.163
We want you to know
that Anne, Jennifer,

30:51.165 --> 30:53.497
and your mother and
father are in the thoughts

30:53.499 --> 30:55.163
and prayers of all of
us in the 15th MEU.

30:55.165 --> 30:57.289
We will fight in their honor,

30:57.291 --> 30:58.873
and the honor of
everyone who was killed

30:58.875 --> 31:01.208
in the attack on Los Angeles.

31:01.210 --> 31:04.083
I promise we will not
stop until every one

31:04.085 --> 31:06.459
of those metal bastards
is driven back

31:06.461 --> 31:07.874
to wherever the hell
they came from.

31:07.876 --> 31:09.917
I'll go wherever I'm needed.

31:09.919 --> 31:12.293
I'll fight if I have to.

31:12.295 --> 31:14.500
- Lieutenant...
- Outstanding, Lieutenant!

31:14.502 --> 31:17.000
Your resilience in North
Africa was inspirational.

31:17.002 --> 31:18.210
What I wanted to say was...

31:18.212 --> 31:20.501
And we both believe
that you would make

31:20.503 --> 31:22.669
and excellent platoon
leader of the 15th.

31:22.671 --> 31:25.670
I'd be honored, sir.

31:25.672 --> 31:28.462
Fortunately, we have
some time though.

31:28.464 --> 31:31.046
For now, the 15th is
taking some time to rest,

31:31.048 --> 31:33.671
to take stock and recharge.

31:33.673 --> 31:36.630
We're all needed after the hell
we went through over there.

31:36.632 --> 31:38.088
We lost a lot of good Marines.

31:38.090 --> 31:40.090
Yeah, it was a
shit storm, all right,

31:40.092 --> 31:42.006
but we still kicked their asses,

31:42.008 --> 31:43.840
and we will do the same
again when we take

31:43.842 --> 31:46.548
the fight up to these metal
bastards across the Pacific.

31:46.550 --> 31:49.216
But right now, we got
a bunch of new recruits

31:49.218 --> 31:51.467
heading off to Paris
Island for training,

31:51.469 --> 31:53.132
and I need someone who
can kick 'em into shape

31:53.134 --> 31:54.882
before they ship
out in 10 weeks.

31:54.884 --> 31:57.093
You think you can do that?

31:57.095 --> 31:59.883
Certainly, sir.

31:59.885 --> 32:02.677
There are counselors on that
base there too, Lieutenant.

32:02.679 --> 32:05.469
I know nothing will
ever make it right,

32:05.471 --> 32:06.677
but they can help you cope.

32:06.679 --> 32:08.635
Yeah...

32:08.637 --> 32:11.219
There ain't no therapy
like screaming your ass off

32:11.221 --> 32:13.304
at a bunch of wet
knuckleheads.

32:13.306 --> 32:16.430
Am I right, Lieutenant?

32:19.807 --> 32:24.014
Look, I need my best men
in this fight, Jackson.

32:24.016 --> 32:26.555
So, you do whatever
you gotta do.

32:26.557 --> 32:29.806
Go check on your
brother, John, right?

32:29.808 --> 32:32.849
He's on his way to Paris
Island right now.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.850
I have my doubts
about him, sir.

32:34.852 --> 32:36.600
Well, if anyone can make
soldiers of these boys,

32:36.602 --> 32:38.141
it's you, Lieutenant.

32:38.143 --> 32:39.557
I'll certainly try, sir.

32:41.103 --> 32:42.183
I know you will.

32:48.229 --> 32:51.853
The more we push him, Colonel,

32:51.855 --> 32:54.103
the worse it'll be for
him when he breaks.

32:56.770 --> 32:58.769
I'm all right with that, Major.

32:58.771 --> 33:00.104
Just as long as we win.

33:13.817 --> 33:15.106
Is this seat taken?

33:23.651 --> 33:24.691
I'm Tracy.

33:25.902 --> 33:26.734
Oh, John.

33:27.943 --> 33:30.276
You can probably call me Blake.

33:30.278 --> 33:32.692
Oh, right, sir names, yeah.

33:32.694 --> 33:33.734
Uh, Gleeson.

33:37.320 --> 33:40.861
So, has anyone shouted
in your face yet?

33:40.863 --> 33:43.027
No.

33:43.029 --> 33:46.277
- Does that really happen?
- Yeah, I think so.

33:46.279 --> 33:47.319
Oh.

33:49.740 --> 33:52.113
To be honest this was kind of
a spur of the moment thing.

33:52.115 --> 33:54.196
I don't know how I
feel about it yet.

33:57.950 --> 33:59.655
Not much we can
do about it now.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.867
Yeah, I think that's only
just starting to hit me.

34:11.202 --> 34:13.114
What the hell are
you knuckleheads doing?

34:13.117 --> 34:16.159
Get your asses out
here and fall in line?

34:16.161 --> 34:17.159
Move, move, move!

34:18.994 --> 34:20.117
Stand up straight!

34:21.119 --> 34:22.159
Eyes front!

34:27.038 --> 34:28.911
What is your name?

34:28.913 --> 34:30.786
Eyes front, god dammit!

34:30.789 --> 34:32.079
When I give you an
order, you will obey.

34:32.081 --> 34:33.119
Now what the fuck is your name?

34:33.121 --> 34:34.119
Dreyfus, sir.

34:34.121 --> 34:35.244
No, it is not!

34:38.956 --> 34:40.079
What is your name?

34:41.791 --> 34:43.164
Eyes front, god dammit!

34:43.166 --> 34:44.746
Lewis, sir!

34:44.748 --> 34:45.580
No, it is not!

34:51.125 --> 34:52.123
What is your name?

34:53.918 --> 34:55.708
Wilcox, sir!

34:55.710 --> 34:56.541
Wrong!

35:00.168 --> 35:02.583
What is your name!

35:02.585 --> 35:05.001
Gleeson, sir, it
really is Gleeson!

35:05.003 --> 35:05.835
No, it is not!

35:11.130 --> 35:12.378
What is your name?

35:15.172 --> 35:16.628
It's John Blake, really.

35:19.338 --> 35:20.755
It's on my driver's license
if you wanna take a look.

35:20.757 --> 35:22.630
Really?

35:22.632 --> 35:25.838
You wanna show me
your drivers license?

35:25.840 --> 35:26.671
Then show it to me!

35:28.882 --> 35:29.755
No?

35:31.634 --> 35:35.132
That's right, you can't
show me your drivers license

35:35.134 --> 35:37.090
because all your stuff
was confiscated

35:37.092 --> 35:39.798
before you arrived
on this island!

35:39.800 --> 35:42.382
So, were you just being
a smart ass, recruit?

35:45.302 --> 35:47.175
Were you being a god
damn smart ass?

35:47.177 --> 35:49.260
Yes, sir, I was being
a smart ass, sir.

35:49.262 --> 35:51.260
Get your face on the floor,

35:51.262 --> 35:54.219
and give me 20 pushups for
being a god damn smart ass!

35:54.221 --> 35:55.052
Now, shit brain!

35:58.137 --> 36:00.719
Does anyone else feel
like being a smart ass?

36:03.264 --> 36:04.095
No?

36:05.014 --> 36:06.054
Good!

36:07.389 --> 36:09.220
Because that attitude
will get you,

36:09.222 --> 36:11.179
the man fighting beside you,

36:11.181 --> 36:15.680
and everyone you fight
to protect all dead.

36:15.682 --> 36:17.930
We are at war with an
enemy that does not care

36:17.932 --> 36:20.722
who you are or who
you think you are.

36:20.724 --> 36:24.974
It does not care about
honor and glory.

36:24.976 --> 36:27.141
It is here to wipe everything
you have ever known

36:27.143 --> 36:29.974
off the face of the earth.

36:29.976 --> 36:33.018
Your pride as a Marine, your
service to your country,

36:36.269 --> 36:38.976
your sacrifice for
the greater good.

36:38.978 --> 36:40.101
All count for nothing!

36:42.936 --> 36:46.353
The only thing standing
between the machines

36:46.355 --> 36:48.728
and total annihilation
of the human race

36:48.730 --> 36:50.894
is your ability to aim
your gun and shoot.

36:53.063 --> 36:55.020
You are either a
machine killer...

36:56.273 --> 36:57.313
Or you are dead.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.646
Now...

37:03.275 --> 37:04.939
For the last god damn time...

37:07.233 --> 37:08.690
What is your name?

37:08.692 --> 37:10.731
How about machine killer, sir?

37:12.985 --> 37:14.566
Say it like you mean it?

37:14.568 --> 37:16.525
Machine killer, sir!

37:16.527 --> 37:18.191
What is your name?

37:18.193 --> 37:19.191
Machine killer, sir!

37:19.193 --> 37:21.025
What is your name?

37:21.027 --> 37:22.110
Machine killer, sir!

37:22.112 --> 37:24.110
What is your name?

37:24.112 --> 37:26.068
Machine killer, sir!

37:26.070 --> 37:28.110
Good, mess hall, five minutes.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.985
If you're late, you're out!

37:31.987 --> 37:33.528
Chris?

37:33.530 --> 37:35.195
That's Lieutenant, recruit.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.028
Sorry, sir.

37:41.614 --> 37:45.030
You did the right
thing by joining up,

37:45.032 --> 37:47.238
but my job is to watch over
the first wave of new recruits,

37:47.240 --> 37:49.947
not pat you on the back.

37:49.949 --> 37:52.782
You work hard, you
follow orders.

37:55.409 --> 37:56.990
And don't fuck this up.

38:05.119 --> 38:06.159
Stay calm!

38:07.202 --> 38:10.325
Breath!

38:12.246 --> 38:14.036
Your weapon is your ally!

38:18.454 --> 38:19.286
Read it well!

38:22.704 --> 38:24.077
And it will protect you!

38:35.541 --> 38:37.331
Relax those
shoulders, Gleeson.

38:41.083 --> 38:42.123
Nice work.

38:52.128 --> 38:53.709
Let me ask you a question.

38:55.335 --> 38:57.125
Who here has seen
an enemy drone?

39:05.213 --> 39:06.211
You from Los Angeles?

39:08.172 --> 39:11.003
So, you know what
we're up against?

39:11.005 --> 39:12.961
Yeah, I've seen
what they can do.

39:16.132 --> 39:19.173
After seeing the horrors
that these drones can cause,

39:20.925 --> 39:21.964
this man...

39:24.217 --> 39:25.048
Chooses to fight.

39:31.717 --> 39:32.799
What would you do?

39:38.344 --> 39:39.759
Why don't we find out?

39:47.262 --> 39:48.594
Your instinct is right.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.512
The first thing you do when
you see an enemy drone is hide.

39:56.181 --> 39:57.220
You...

39:58.347 --> 40:01.220
You would've been shot.

40:01.222 --> 40:02.722
We've been collecting
these things

40:02.724 --> 40:05.264
ever since they showed
up in the South Pacific,

40:05.266 --> 40:07.180
and believe me, we are
doing everything we can

40:07.182 --> 40:08.307
to figure them out.

40:08.309 --> 40:09.847
Luis?

40:09.849 --> 40:12.264
If you can control the things,

40:12.266 --> 40:15.224
why aren't we using them
against the machines?

40:15.226 --> 40:17.391
We've tried.

40:17.393 --> 40:19.974
The machines just
override our signal.

40:19.976 --> 40:22.266
Anything we send into battle,

40:22.268 --> 40:24.224
ends up being used against
out our own soldiers.

40:24.226 --> 40:26.142
Hell, even our own
drones are susceptible

40:26.144 --> 40:28.767
to hijacking from the
enemy carriers, no!

40:28.769 --> 40:31.059
Right now we are
depending on the best

40:33.271 --> 40:34.894
most reliable weapon we have.

40:38.271 --> 40:39.811
That's us.

40:39.813 --> 40:42.228
Soldiers, like you and me.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.063
This machine can see you.

40:48.398 --> 40:50.813
It can hear you.

40:50.815 --> 40:53.148
Hell, it can smell
you from miles away,

40:53.150 --> 40:54.856
and it is very, very fast.

40:58.233 --> 41:00.106
But it has a few weaknesses.

41:02.193 --> 41:03.232
Weakness number one...

41:07.027 --> 41:11.233
Enemy drones rely on
their carrier to recharge.

41:11.235 --> 41:13.608
If they get cut off
from their carrier,

41:13.610 --> 41:17.693
they will go to grounds
to conserve energy.

41:17.695 --> 41:20.110
Finding this out is
what saved Los Angeles.

41:25.322 --> 41:26.237
Weakness number two!

41:33.199 --> 41:37.072
These things are damned heavy!

41:39.240 --> 41:41.113
So, when they hover...

41:41.115 --> 41:42.155
Or they jump...

41:44.284 --> 41:47.700
They create a distinct
seismic pattern,

41:49.327 --> 41:51.200
which we can detect from
up to five miles away

41:51.202 --> 41:53.909
using these things!

41:53.911 --> 41:55.576
And we call them scan sticks.

41:58.369 --> 42:00.702
These will save your life.

42:00.704 --> 42:01.827
So use them, often!

42:05.329 --> 42:06.577
All right, let's go!

42:06.579 --> 42:07.619
Move it out!

43:01.255 --> 43:02.545
Well, I'll be damned.

43:06.257 --> 43:07.088
What the hell?

43:09.465 --> 43:10.547
Blake...

43:11.967 --> 43:13.215
He saved your asses.

43:26.427 --> 43:28.342
You're the only fighter
team to figure that out

43:28.344 --> 43:30.259
on their first
attempt, well done.

43:33.554 --> 43:36.052
You'll probably still die.

43:36.054 --> 43:37.469
But you'll die a Marine.

43:42.347 --> 43:46.720
- If I die in a gunman zone
- If I die in a gunman zone

43:46.722 --> 43:51.512
- Box me up and ship me home
- Box me up and ship me home

43:51.514 --> 43:55.764
- Pin my medals upon my chest
- Pin my medals upon my chest

43:55.766 --> 43:57.514
Tell my momma I did my best

43:57.516 --> 44:00.932
So, what's the story, Blake?

44:00.934 --> 44:02.057
You and Lieutenant
Jackson knew each other

44:02.059 --> 44:03.265
before we came here, right?

44:10.351 --> 44:11.182
He's my brother?

44:13.561 --> 44:14.809
He's your brother.

44:17.353 --> 44:20.017
And you're only
telling me this now?

44:20.019 --> 44:22.019
He's kind of a brother.

44:22.021 --> 44:23.186
What does that mean?

44:26.563 --> 44:28.978
Me real mom and dad
died when I was 15.

44:31.563 --> 44:34.228
Truck hit 'em on the
I-5, broke the car.

44:37.023 --> 44:38.188
My family was always
close with the Jacksons

44:38.190 --> 44:39.105
so they took me in.

44:41.273 --> 44:44.147
Ever since his family's
kind of been my family.

44:46.150 --> 44:47.856
That was until LA got hit.

44:50.610 --> 44:52.233
Now, it's just me and Chris.

44:53.985 --> 44:55.149
We're all that's left.

44:59.568 --> 45:02.610
You know, back in LA, I could
barely keep my mouth shut.

45:05.402 --> 45:07.651
I could get juiced
up about anything.

45:07.653 --> 45:10.402
Tossing a football, replacing
a spar, fixing a cabinet.

45:14.447 --> 45:16.237
Now, I just keep seeing
their faces right after

45:16.239 --> 45:17.362
they got out of the car.

45:22.197 --> 45:24.195
I fucked up, and
now they're gone.

45:26.865 --> 45:28.697
It wasn't your fault, Blake.

45:28.699 --> 45:31.030
A lot of people died that day.

45:31.032 --> 45:32.989
There was nothing you could do.

45:34.867 --> 45:37.282
I guess that's why we're
here though, right.

45:37.284 --> 45:39.867
So we can do something.

45:39.869 --> 45:40.950
Yeah, I hope so.

45:45.369 --> 45:48.534
My brother was a soldier too.

45:48.536 --> 45:51.284
You never mentioned
your brother before.

45:51.286 --> 45:53.659
He was killed in
Afghanistan a few years ago.

45:53.661 --> 45:55.077
Damn.

45:55.079 --> 45:56.119
I'm sorry.

45:58.829 --> 46:01.246
I was so angry
when he joined up.

46:01.248 --> 46:03.412
My parents too.

46:03.414 --> 46:05.287
Couldn't understand
why he did it.

46:06.748 --> 46:08.037
Then he died, and...

46:13.958 --> 46:16.706
It kind of changed
things for me.

46:16.708 --> 46:18.749
I had to try and make
sense of it all.

46:18.751 --> 46:19.832
Did you?

46:21.751 --> 46:22.832
Not really.

46:25.168 --> 46:27.958
But I'm starting to.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.126
It's not about
fighting or winning,

46:29.128 --> 46:30.292
it's about protecting.

46:34.711 --> 46:37.334
What am I protecting?

46:37.336 --> 46:38.501
I've got nothing left.

46:41.920 --> 46:43.668
You got somethin'
left, you got us.

46:50.338 --> 46:52.545
One two three four
United States Marine Corp

46:52.547 --> 46:55.255
One two three four
United States Marine Corp

46:55.257 --> 46:57.755
One two three four
United States Marine Corp

46:57.757 --> 47:00.463
One two three four
United States Marine Corp

47:16.760 --> 47:17.592
Down! Down!

47:28.429 --> 47:29.510
Wilcox!

47:30.264 --> 47:31.095
Move! Move!

47:43.641 --> 47:44.472
Blake!

47:50.474 --> 47:51.347
Blake!

47:56.059 --> 47:58.307
Get those scan
sticks in the ground!

48:03.644 --> 48:05.434
This place is
crawling with drones!

48:05.436 --> 48:09.019
Tell me somethin'
I don't know!

48:09.021 --> 48:10.309
There's a ridge
to the northeast

48:10.311 --> 48:11.644
where their numbers
have thinned.

48:11.646 --> 48:13.809
We might be able
to punch through.

48:13.811 --> 48:15.936
All right, you heard
the man! Move out!

48:15.938 --> 48:16.769
Come on!

48:31.358 --> 48:33.148
Y'all try to get some sleep.

48:35.400 --> 48:39.065
We won't be down
there for tonight.

48:47.985 --> 48:49.191
Go! Go!

48:49.193 --> 48:50.233
Load those motherfuckers!

48:50.235 --> 48:51.691
Move! Move!

48:56.570 --> 48:57.610
Move! Move!

49:03.780 --> 49:04.820
A grandeur!

49:21.367 --> 49:23.947
Come on, Lewis, come on!

49:23.949 --> 49:25.782
Go, go, go!

49:25.784 --> 49:26.824
I got this!

51:29.556 --> 51:33.139
This the fishing part
of the mission brief?

51:33.141 --> 51:34.806
I must have missed that part.

51:39.099 --> 51:40.389
What's going on, Chris?

51:42.141 --> 51:44.182
Are we waiting for orders?

51:44.184 --> 51:46.224
It's good to see
you too, Brother.

51:46.226 --> 51:47.391
I'm glad you survived.

51:52.226 --> 51:53.308
Can you hear it?

51:56.394 --> 51:57.434
Hear what?

52:01.271 --> 52:02.352
Waves on the beach.

52:04.228 --> 52:05.060
Wind in the trees.

52:06.563 --> 52:07.644
Call of the birds.

52:09.396 --> 52:11.396
The guns have stopped.

52:11.398 --> 52:12.229
Battle's over.

52:16.231 --> 52:17.146
What are you saying?

52:17.148 --> 52:19.521
We still have our objective.

52:19.523 --> 52:23.231
The mission hasn't changed.

52:23.233 --> 52:26.398
There are meant to be two
platoons on this island.

52:26.400 --> 52:31.316
Now, there's just you, me,
and these knuckleheads.

52:31.318 --> 52:32.357
It's not enough.

52:34.068 --> 52:35.275
There might be others.

52:35.277 --> 52:36.816
Scattered.

52:36.818 --> 52:38.191
Lost.

52:38.193 --> 52:39.233
Probably dead.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.151
So, do we give up?

52:47.862 --> 52:50.070
Just wait on the beach
until the machines find us?

52:50.072 --> 52:53.110
They've left us alone so far.

52:53.112 --> 52:55.820
We're not a threat to them here.

52:55.822 --> 52:59.445
And how long do you
think that's gonna last?

52:59.447 --> 53:03.197
And even if they do
ignore us, what then?

53:03.199 --> 53:04.905
Sit on the beach and
look at the water

53:04.907 --> 53:06.863
while the rest of
the world fights!

53:11.282 --> 53:15.199
It's not on you to
win the war, John.

53:15.201 --> 53:18.240
You don't have to keep
fighting because of them.

53:27.744 --> 53:29.951
That's what you
think this is about.

53:34.454 --> 53:37.911
I know I screwed up in LA.

53:37.913 --> 53:40.452
But the machines killed
your family, not me!

53:43.789 --> 53:46.371
I'm here on this island

53:46.373 --> 53:48.496
because that's what
needs to be done!

53:51.416 --> 53:53.206
I'm not gonna stop
until it's finished.

53:53.208 --> 53:56.414
You can do whatever
you want, brother,

53:56.416 --> 53:57.748
but don't fuck this up.

53:59.791 --> 54:02.333
We may not have much
here, but it's ours.

54:02.335 --> 54:03.958
And we intend to keep it!

54:27.547 --> 54:30.253
To Wilcox and Miller.

54:30.255 --> 54:31.295
Wilcox and Miller.

54:40.465 --> 54:41.297
To Gleeson.

54:42.842 --> 54:45.255
I hope she gets better soon.

54:45.257 --> 54:47.382
Shark One won't be
the same without her.

54:47.384 --> 54:48.215
Gleeson.

54:56.427 --> 54:58.383
I'm gonna need another round.

54:58.385 --> 54:59.425
I got this.

55:04.346 --> 55:06.719
- Evening, Corporal.
- Major Atkins, sir.

55:06.721 --> 55:10.427
No need for that here,
we're both off duty.

55:10.429 --> 55:13.595
I'm just here to make sure
you boys behave yourselves.

55:16.264 --> 55:18.429
It's just a few drinks, sir.

55:18.431 --> 55:20.637
I think we're gonna
turn in early.

55:20.639 --> 55:22.472
It's not you three
I'm worried about.

55:26.932 --> 55:31.807
I guess we all gotta let
off steam after Taiwan.

55:31.809 --> 55:34.307
You were LA born and
raised, right Blake?

55:34.309 --> 55:35.891
Yeah.

55:35.893 --> 55:37.891
Have you ever traveled abroad?

55:37.893 --> 55:39.516
Does New Orleans count?

55:39.518 --> 55:41.351
I've been there a
bunch of times.

55:41.353 --> 55:44.851
Yeah, New Orleans counts.

55:44.853 --> 55:47.226
How does it feel being
so far from home?

55:49.353 --> 55:50.309
It feels like there's
a lot of ocean

55:50.311 --> 55:52.476
between us and the
Santa Monica pier.

55:55.355 --> 55:58.269
I'm afraid I'll never
see my home again, sir.

56:01.313 --> 56:02.769
You're a smart
man, Corporal Blake,

56:02.771 --> 56:04.936
you know what we're
up against here.

56:08.356 --> 56:09.731
The enemy has built
a wall between us

56:09.733 --> 56:12.481
and the West Coast in America.

56:12.483 --> 56:16.190
Until we can find a
way to break it,

56:16.192 --> 56:19.273
we're stuck here,
there's no goin' home.

56:19.275 --> 56:21.358
The 15th will need
people like you

56:21.360 --> 56:25.358
and Lance Corporal Gleeson
to keep it together.

56:25.360 --> 56:28.650
I want you to keep that in mind.

56:28.652 --> 56:30.275
Try to keep a clear head.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.525
Thank you, sir.

56:33.527 --> 56:34.567
I'll do my best.

56:37.403 --> 56:38.735
I know you will, Corporal.

56:38.737 --> 56:39.818
Sir, you can't come in.

56:39.820 --> 56:41.235
You're gonna have to leave.

56:41.237 --> 56:43.153
Fuck, I'm a god damn
United States Marine!

56:43.155 --> 56:45.237
Shit, god damn Jackson.

56:45.239 --> 56:47.445
Please, sir, could
you let me handle this?

56:47.447 --> 56:50.278
I understand that,
but you're drunk, mate.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.445
Go ahead, just get
him out of here.

56:52.447 --> 56:53.447
You bail at me through this,

56:53.449 --> 56:55.030
this won't go well for you.

56:55.032 --> 56:56.363
Trust me, I'll fuck you up!

56:56.365 --> 56:59.947
Hey, see! This guy's with me!

56:59.949 --> 57:02.365
Shark One Platoon, and
we're the ones protecting

57:02.367 --> 57:03.655
- your country, asshole!
- Come on, Chris.

57:03.657 --> 57:06.574
Let's skidaddy,
come on, come on!

57:06.576 --> 57:08.032
Fuck 'em!

57:08.034 --> 57:09.074
Kids!

57:13.327 --> 57:15.992
I hope you're enjoying
the end of the world!

57:19.327 --> 57:23.369
I bet you all raised
your glasses, right?

57:23.371 --> 57:25.077
To the brave
brothers of the 15th

57:25.079 --> 57:26.327
who gave their lives.

57:28.579 --> 57:30.411
I figured awhile back,

57:30.413 --> 57:32.496
it's quicker to drink
straight from the bottle.

57:32.498 --> 57:34.287
We'd be here all
night otherwise.

57:39.081 --> 57:41.496
To the 15th, MEU,
and all the dead

57:41.498 --> 57:43.204
whose names I can't remember.

57:47.791 --> 57:50.414
You don't seem to
be torn up about it.

57:50.416 --> 57:52.249
That's the advantage
of having no hope.

57:52.251 --> 57:54.458
It's liberating,
you should try it.

57:54.460 --> 57:57.124
So, you're just giving up?

57:57.126 --> 57:58.416
One minor setback, you're
ready to surrender?

57:58.418 --> 57:59.458
Setback?

58:00.710 --> 58:03.041
We tried to take back Taiwan,

58:03.043 --> 58:05.459
and we lost the whole
Southeast Asia.

58:05.461 --> 58:07.001
That's not a setback,

58:07.003 --> 58:10.334
it's a fucking catastrophe.

58:10.336 --> 58:14.086
And now the northeast
is almost lost as well.

58:14.088 --> 58:16.253
The entire 13th MEU
gone at Okinawa.

58:19.422 --> 58:20.253
2,000 Marines dead.

58:25.507 --> 58:30.338
I mean, how do you replace an
entire unit of 2,000 Marines?

58:30.340 --> 58:33.465
I knew some people
from the 13th.

58:33.467 --> 58:35.840
My friends from bootcamp.

58:35.842 --> 58:38.673
There's no replacing them.

58:38.675 --> 58:41.465
Man, I didn't
mean it like that.

58:41.467 --> 58:43.548
Look, the 15th will fight on.

58:43.550 --> 58:44.423
We're still strong.

58:46.344 --> 58:47.384
Not that strong.

58:49.469 --> 58:51.510
Pretty soon this place
is gonna get hit too.

58:51.512 --> 58:54.425
We can't hold 'em off.

58:54.427 --> 58:56.134
We either bail out or we die.

58:59.596 --> 59:01.427
Don't know where we'll go
if we do have to bail out.

59:01.429 --> 59:02.387
Maybe Antarctica?

59:02.389 --> 59:04.428
I don't wanna think like that.

59:05.764 --> 59:06.596
I can't.

59:08.931 --> 59:11.012
I get it, yeah, I get it.

59:11.014 --> 59:12.347
Better to die on your feet

59:12.349 --> 59:14.429
than live on your knees, right?

59:14.431 --> 59:16.429
Hmm, yeah, well tell
that to the guy

59:16.431 --> 59:19.555
I saw getting his legs
blown off in Fiji.

59:19.557 --> 59:20.389
We're fucked.

59:24.518 --> 59:25.849
Oh, where are you going?

59:29.393 --> 59:30.349
To visit a friend.

59:49.646 --> 59:50.478
Hey.

59:55.481 --> 59:56.521
Hey.

59:57.731 --> 59:58.646
You're awake.

59:58.648 --> 01:00:00.688
What the fuck?

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.606
- Where am I?
- In the hospital.

01:00:02.608 --> 01:00:03.938
We're in Sydney.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.398
Sydney?

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.398
Shit!

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.523
Hey, it's okay,
hey, you're okay!

01:00:09.525 --> 01:00:11.273
It's okay, it's okay!

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:13.816
She's okay, she just woke up.

01:00:13.818 --> 01:00:14.900
I'll organize you
some breakfast.

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.316
Try to relax, Miss.

01:00:16.318 --> 01:00:17.858
Hey, hey, look at me.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.441
Look at me!

01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:21.442
You're here now,
we're safe, okay.

01:00:23.903 --> 01:00:25.401
See?

01:00:25.403 --> 01:00:26.443
Arms.

01:00:27.487 --> 01:00:28.735
Legs.

01:00:28.737 --> 01:00:29.568
All intact.

01:00:31.905 --> 01:00:32.986
You did real good.

01:00:34.739 --> 01:00:36.570
And we got promoted, both of us.

01:00:36.572 --> 01:00:38.487
- Really!
- Yeah.

01:00:38.489 --> 01:00:42.155
They made you Lance
Corporal for you know...

01:00:42.157 --> 01:00:43.695
Getting shot, I guess.

01:00:43.697 --> 01:00:44.695
That takes balls.

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:48.155
What'd you get?

01:00:48.157 --> 01:00:49.155
I got Corporal.

01:00:51.742 --> 01:00:54.572
I don't know why, I only
got a few cuts and bruises.

01:00:54.574 --> 01:00:55.697
No, you deserved it.

01:00:57.367 --> 01:00:58.490
You got us out of there.

01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:03.742
Not everyone.

01:01:08.202 --> 01:01:09.701
So, when do we ship out?

01:01:12.494 --> 01:01:15.411
I sail north with the Shark
One Platoon in two weeks.

01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:18.787
We're deploying just
outside of Darwin.

01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:21.037
But your mission is
to get strong, Glees.

01:01:21.039 --> 01:01:22.327
And after that, if you want,

01:01:22.329 --> 01:01:24.496
you can stay right
here in Australia.

01:01:24.498 --> 01:01:25.621
No...

01:01:25.623 --> 01:01:27.162
There's a marine base here,

01:01:27.164 --> 01:01:28.704
and they need all the
smart people they can get.

01:01:28.706 --> 01:01:30.454
I talked to Jackson, he can
get you a position there.

01:01:30.456 --> 01:01:32.039
They have computers and science,

01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:33.746
all that nerd stuff you like.

01:01:33.748 --> 01:01:37.706
No, I wanna go back!

01:01:42.168 --> 01:01:43.916
Just rest up.

01:01:43.918 --> 01:01:44.749
Think about it.

01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:49.541
We need these people ready

01:01:49.543 --> 01:01:51.583
for air transport
in half an hour.

01:01:51.585 --> 01:01:54.000
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes, of course.

01:01:56.545 --> 01:01:58.834
- What's going on?
- They're here.

01:01:58.836 --> 01:02:00.418
Report to your superior
immediately, Corporal.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.836
Blake, what's happening?

01:02:02.838 --> 01:02:05.503
They're gonna get you out.

01:02:05.505 --> 01:02:07.420
Don't worry, everything's
gonna be fine.

01:02:09.463 --> 01:02:10.545
See you soon.

01:02:57.889 --> 01:03:00.054
Thinking of
rejoining the fight?

01:03:00.056 --> 01:03:01.179
I intend to, sir.

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:16.474
Can you believe I found this
chicken just walkin' around?

01:03:16.476 --> 01:03:18.141
There's food everywhere here.

01:03:20.186 --> 01:03:21.267
Want some?

01:03:23.893 --> 01:03:25.641
Hutchins, you
okay with all this?

01:03:29.103 --> 01:03:32.436
I don't know, man,
Jackson's our CO.

01:03:32.438 --> 01:03:34.394
Yeah, but he's fuckin' nuts.

01:03:34.396 --> 01:03:35.769
Same as the rest of us.

01:03:46.773 --> 01:03:48.563
You should wear
your uniform, Lewis,

01:03:48.565 --> 01:03:50.521
you're exposing
yourself to the enemy.

01:03:50.523 --> 01:03:53.523
How's this for
exposing myself?

01:03:53.525 --> 01:03:56.523
You see? Total disarray.

01:03:56.525 --> 01:03:58.190
No one listens to me anymore.

01:04:03.943 --> 01:04:04.982
Damn it's hot.

01:04:09.443 --> 01:04:11.943
So, was this the
plan all along?

01:04:11.945 --> 01:04:14.068
Find yourself a nice
tropical island?

01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:14.943
Go AWOL?

01:04:19.237 --> 01:04:22.570
It crossed my
mind once or twice.

01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:25.445
I thought you of all
people would understand.

01:04:26.822 --> 01:04:27.862
Once, maybe.

01:04:28.905 --> 01:04:29.778
Not now.

01:04:31.907 --> 01:04:33.238
You'll come around.

01:04:35.489 --> 01:04:36.905
Don't shoot!

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.405
Dreyfus!

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:39.447
God dammit!

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.615
Is that chicken?

01:04:47.992 --> 01:04:51.115
It's good to see you, buddy.

01:04:51.117 --> 01:04:52.282
You too, Corporal Blake.

01:05:21.081 --> 01:05:22.956
So, what happened?

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:23.831
Where'd you end up?

01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:30.748
We landed, I don't know,
somewhere west of here.

01:05:35.418 --> 01:05:37.041
We lost Lieutenant Macey.

01:05:38.376 --> 01:05:42.960
He kept saying we had
to reach the objective.

01:05:45.086 --> 01:05:46.876
I think he completely lost it.

01:05:50.128 --> 01:05:51.543
Gleeson kept it together though.

01:05:51.545 --> 01:05:52.876
She was always the smart one.

01:05:52.878 --> 01:05:53.918
Gleeson?

01:05:54.463 --> 01:05:55.461
Gleeson is alive?

01:05:57.463 --> 01:05:58.795
Last time I saw her.

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.630
We got separated
up at the ridge.

01:06:11.007 --> 01:06:11.838
Well...

01:06:13.592 --> 01:06:16.798
By that I mean I ran away.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.340
After she went ahead
to scout the ridge,

01:06:20.342 --> 01:06:22.298
I scanned five drones
heading my way.

01:06:24.594 --> 01:06:26.717
I had to get out of there.

01:06:53.974 --> 01:06:56.097
I should have
stayed, shouldn't I?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.181
I just got scared, you know.

01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:05.389
I know we're not
supposed to be scared,

01:07:05.391 --> 01:07:06.806
but I'm always scared.

01:07:09.518 --> 01:07:13.016
How'd you find your way back?

01:07:13.018 --> 01:07:15.184
Hey, you think we
can go find her?

01:07:15.186 --> 01:07:16.226
I don't know.

01:07:17.853 --> 01:07:19.934
We got so close
to the objective.

01:07:22.769 --> 01:07:25.269
There are drones everywhere.

01:07:25.271 --> 01:07:26.978
That's okay.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.061
You know why?

01:07:28.063 --> 01:07:29.436
Why?

01:07:29.438 --> 01:07:31.436
We got this.

01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:32.936
This is the machine killer.

01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:36.063
This is amazing.

01:07:37.731 --> 01:07:39.104
Where did you get it?

01:07:39.106 --> 01:07:40.896
From a dead alien.

01:07:40.898 --> 01:07:44.313
- What does it do?
- I don't know.

01:07:44.315 --> 01:07:45.523
- Let's find out.
- What, right now?

01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:46.440
Sure!

01:07:46.442 --> 01:07:48.065
Why not?

01:07:48.067 --> 01:07:49.023
You should be the
one to test it.

01:07:49.025 --> 01:07:50.523
Keep it.

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:52.148
Leave your backpack.

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.358
We take rifles only.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.191
We travel light.

01:07:59.527 --> 01:08:01.067
Hey! Where are you going?

01:08:03.152 --> 01:08:05.235
We're going to find Gleeson.

01:08:05.237 --> 01:08:06.900
She might still be alive.

01:08:06.902 --> 01:08:10.443
I told you not to
fuck this up, John.

01:08:10.445 --> 01:08:12.360
You go out there,
you're not coming back.

01:08:12.362 --> 01:08:14.528
God dammit Chris.

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.444
What ever happened to never
leaving a marine behind?

01:08:16.447 --> 01:08:18.736
They left us all behind.

01:08:18.738 --> 01:08:21.321
Why can't you see that?

01:08:21.323 --> 01:08:24.279
You do whatever you want.

01:08:24.282 --> 01:08:25.612
I'm still a marine!

01:08:25.613 --> 01:08:26.697
Then you're a fool!

01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:56.202
Hey, Gleeson.

01:09:06.287 --> 01:09:07.286
Go.

01:09:07.287 --> 01:09:09.495
Get some rest.

01:10:13.385 --> 01:10:15.549
They're everywhere.

01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:17.466
They don't seem
to care about us.

01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:21.509
It's nice here.

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:24.509
Yeah.

01:10:24.511 --> 01:10:25.550
It's quiet.

01:10:31.639 --> 01:10:34.387
I heard about what
happened up north.

01:10:34.389 --> 01:10:35.261
Yeah.

01:10:38.597 --> 01:10:40.512
It got pretty hairy for awhile.

01:10:46.806 --> 01:10:49.554
There's a mission coming
up, an important one.

01:10:52.391 --> 01:10:53.307
I know you guys have
been through a lot...

01:10:53.309 --> 01:10:54.349
I know.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.431
I heard about it.

01:11:00.394 --> 01:11:01.225
Jackson told you.

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:07.351
You wanna go?

01:11:09.979 --> 01:11:11.560
Honestly, I'm scared.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.020
But yeah, yeah, I want to.

01:11:19.646 --> 01:11:20.478
Me too.

01:11:24.605 --> 01:11:25.436
I'm ready.

01:11:29.024 --> 01:11:30.188
I think we all are.

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.355
I got your back, Glees.

01:11:39.484 --> 01:11:40.565
I know.

01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:38.449
Clear.

01:12:44.037 --> 01:12:45.660
- You said clear!
- They were sleeping!

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:46.660
Shoot the damn ray gun!

01:12:57.247 --> 01:12:59.412
Jesus Christ, it's me!

01:12:59.414 --> 01:13:00.246
Blake?

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.498
Where have you been?

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.580
You! Bastard! Where
the hell did you go?

01:13:09.582 --> 01:13:10.999
There was five
drones, I panicked.

01:13:11.001 --> 01:13:13.206
Shh, keep your voices down.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:15.291
All army of drones
up that mountain.

01:13:16.543 --> 01:13:17.541
Let's go.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.460
Take cover!

01:13:29.462 --> 01:13:31.169
What the hell?

01:13:35.212 --> 01:13:37.753
I told you not to
come back, Blake!

01:13:37.755 --> 01:13:40.586
Chris, what the fuck?

01:13:40.588 --> 01:13:44.629
Leave, or we'll be
forced to take you down!

01:13:44.631 --> 01:13:46.171
Dude, your brother's
gone completely sideways!

01:13:46.173 --> 01:13:48.004
Ugh! What should we do?

01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:50.673
Okay, so Jackson's
at the rear,

01:13:50.675 --> 01:13:52.630
but they've put themselves
in a narrow spot.

01:13:52.632 --> 01:13:54.630
We split 'em up, we
can narrow the odds.

01:13:54.632 --> 01:13:56.799
Dreyfus, keep 'em occupied
while Gleeson and I flank 'em.

01:13:56.801 --> 01:13:58.589
I'll draw Jackson away.

01:13:58.591 --> 01:13:59.632
You get the drop on
the other three.

01:13:59.634 --> 01:14:00.465
Sound good?

01:14:02.842 --> 01:14:05.215
Yeah, I guess.

01:14:05.217 --> 01:14:08.550
What are you gonna
do with Jackson?

01:14:08.552 --> 01:14:10.759
Let me worry about that.

01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:11.801
Ready?

01:14:13.429 --> 01:14:14.552
Ready.

01:14:14.554 --> 01:14:15.552
Okay.

01:14:15.554 --> 01:14:16.592
Cover me?

01:14:17.595 --> 01:14:19.593
Let's move!

01:14:34.557 --> 01:14:36.347
Lewis, what the
fuck are we doing?

01:14:36.349 --> 01:14:38.431
I don't know, man,
let's take a look.

01:14:40.225 --> 01:14:42.472
Ahh!

01:14:45.643 --> 01:14:46.474
Hey!

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.516
Guns on the ground both of you!

01:14:52.726 --> 01:14:54.433
Dreyfus!

01:14:54.435 --> 01:14:57.518
Hey! You wanna
taste of this, huh?

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.435
Yeah, that's what I thought!

01:16:11.949 --> 01:16:13.531
Hey, Chris!

01:16:13.533 --> 01:16:14.573
Stop!

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:22.365
It's over, Chris!

01:16:24.786 --> 01:16:27.076
We're continuing the mission!

01:16:27.078 --> 01:16:28.784
You can't
fix this, Blake.

01:16:28.786 --> 01:16:29.951
We can if we win.

01:16:31.494 --> 01:16:32.577
We can make it right.

01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:37.036
What's the point?

01:16:38.746 --> 01:16:39.578
I got nothin' left.

01:16:44.622 --> 01:16:45.579
We got each other.

01:16:48.747 --> 01:16:49.620
We're brothers.

01:16:54.123 --> 01:16:55.831
I'm not your brother, John.

01:16:57.917 --> 01:16:58.998
I never was.

01:17:09.127 --> 01:17:10.500
No!

01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:12.500
No!

01:17:57.926 --> 01:17:59.759
Get back! Get back!

01:17:59.761 --> 01:18:00.843
Go, go, go, go!

01:18:07.595 --> 01:18:08.884
Hey, snap out of it!

01:18:08.886 --> 01:18:10.510
You're in command!

01:18:14.512 --> 01:18:15.345
Okay!

01:18:20.806 --> 01:18:22.597
Run back to the river!

01:18:22.599 --> 01:18:25.554
Hutchins, Dreyfus, we're
holdin' the rear. Go!

01:18:40.601 --> 01:18:41.640
No!

01:18:42.728 --> 01:18:43.766
Go, go!

01:18:44.728 --> 01:18:46.517
Go!

01:18:56.645 --> 01:18:58.811
Where's Hutchins?

01:18:58.813 --> 01:19:00.228
He didn't make it.

01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:01.269
Aw, shit.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:05.021
So, what now?

01:19:05.023 --> 01:19:06.521
There are gonna be drones
swarming all around

01:19:06.523 --> 01:19:07.812
us any minute.

01:19:07.814 --> 01:19:09.604
I don't care how
many drones there are.

01:19:09.606 --> 01:19:11.395
We finish the damn mission!

01:19:15.233 --> 01:19:17.440
Gleeson, you've
seen this thing

01:19:17.442 --> 01:19:19.897
we're supposed to
take out, right?

01:19:19.899 --> 01:19:23.148
Well, I haven't seen
it, but I know it's there.

01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:25.316
It's heavily guarded,

01:19:25.318 --> 01:19:27.150
and we'll have to take
down the barrier,

01:19:27.152 --> 01:19:28.649
so I can find a way inside.

01:19:29.902 --> 01:19:31.649
No, I'm taking the bomb.

01:19:34.362 --> 01:19:35.443
Blake...

01:19:37.863 --> 01:19:41.152
That's a thermonuclear
devise on your back.

01:19:41.154 --> 01:19:42.569
Do you know how to use it?

01:19:45.613 --> 01:19:48.361
If it fucks up, do
you know how to fix it?

01:19:51.698 --> 01:19:52.738
Right, so...

01:19:55.073 --> 01:19:57.696
I'll take it inside.

01:19:57.698 --> 01:20:01.740
You guys cover me, so that
nothing shoots me in the back.

01:20:09.283 --> 01:20:10.906
We all knew this was coming.

01:20:15.284 --> 01:20:16.117
Fine.

01:20:19.578 --> 01:20:21.118
Think you could carry this?

01:20:22.953 --> 01:20:23.951
Guess I'll have to.

01:20:27.747 --> 01:20:28.786
Jesus Christ!

01:20:30.329 --> 01:20:32.577
We'll cover you
from both sides.

01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:34.954
You take that thing
straight up the center.

01:20:34.956 --> 01:20:36.287
Drop it on their lap.

01:20:39.332 --> 01:20:40.497
Seems simple enough.

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:49.038
You two, you onboard?

01:20:51.833 --> 01:20:53.748
You're gonna help
us finish this.

01:20:56.042 --> 01:20:57.457
Do we have a choice?

01:20:59.377 --> 01:21:00.416
No, you don't.

01:21:03.043 --> 01:21:04.126
Let's move.

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.096
Are you ready?

01:22:20.891 --> 01:22:21.722
Ready.

01:22:24.143 --> 01:22:27.057
We'll dock 'em nonetheless.

01:22:27.059 --> 01:22:28.266
Light 'em up.

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.974
Now.

01:23:05.608 --> 01:23:06.773
Gleeson, take cover!

01:23:09.734 --> 01:23:11.398
So, we're breaking
radio silence now?

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.440
They know we're here.

01:23:12.442 --> 01:23:14.566
Keep 'em off Gleeson!

01:23:14.568 --> 01:23:16.316
Short bursts!
Focus on the rear!

01:23:16.318 --> 01:23:17.566
Try to thin their numbers.

01:23:17.568 --> 01:23:18.776
You go that way,
I'll go this way!

01:23:18.778 --> 01:23:21.442
We hit 'em on five!

01:23:28.362 --> 01:23:29.986
You're hit!

01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:34.110
Moving position to three!

01:23:47.115 --> 01:23:48.988
Lewis, Docker,
what's your status?

01:23:51.115 --> 01:23:52.197
Fuck!

01:23:52.199 --> 01:23:53.197
Here take this!

01:23:53.199 --> 01:23:54.281
You know what to do!

01:23:54.283 --> 01:23:55.114
Dreyfus!

01:24:31.582 --> 01:24:32.664
I'm good.

01:25:12.588 --> 01:25:13.878
You gotta get clear.

01:25:17.965 --> 01:25:20.212
There's no point both
of us going down.

01:25:23.382 --> 01:25:24.255
I'm not leaving.

01:25:28.551 --> 01:25:30.923
I'll make sure nothin'
comes in after you.

01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:41.342
Okay, John.

01:25:43.429 --> 01:25:44.260
Thanks.

01:26:02.222 --> 01:26:03.055
Over.

01:27:25.904 --> 01:27:27.736
Gleason, there's
more drones coming up!

01:27:27.738 --> 01:27:29.070
We're seriously fucked!

01:28:03.662 --> 01:28:04.993
Blake! You should go.

01:28:07.787 --> 01:28:08.785
I'm fine, we did it.

01:28:11.747 --> 01:28:13.745
Set the bomb now!

01:28:16.997 --> 01:28:18.579
Blake? You're breaking up.

01:29:59.307 --> 01:30:01.555
There are no words to
express the gratitude

01:30:01.557 --> 01:30:03.098
felt by our nation for
your contribution

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:05.473
to the war, Sergeant Blake.

01:30:05.475 --> 01:30:07.683
We have it to you,
and your fellow Marines

01:30:07.685 --> 01:30:10.808
of the 15th MEU have
exposed key weaknesses

01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:13.767
in the enemy's
military apparatus.

01:30:13.769 --> 01:30:16.351
The United States Armed
Forces are now focusing

01:30:16.353 --> 01:30:18.852
on efforts on taking
out these installations

01:30:18.854 --> 01:30:21.309
wherever we find them.

01:30:21.311 --> 01:30:23.684
Most importantly, you
have given us hope again,

01:30:23.686 --> 01:30:26.227
Sergeant Blake.

01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:28.811
Your victory on New
Britain has shown the world

01:30:28.813 --> 01:30:30.812
the enemy can be stopped,

01:30:30.814 --> 01:30:33.605
and the tide is finally turning
this long and terrible war.

01:30:35.814 --> 01:30:36.645
I understand.

01:30:37.939 --> 01:30:38.979
We all do...

01:30:41.649 --> 01:30:46.147
What a great toll a fight
like this has on a marine.

01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:49.815
I think I speak on
behalf of everyone here

01:30:49.817 --> 01:30:53.857
when I say that you've earned
a long break from active duty.

01:30:53.859 --> 01:30:55.648
On your return, we'd
like to offer you a post

01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:58.608
in Pacific Fleet
headquarters in Hawaii.

01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:01.233
I'm sure your first time
experience of enemy technology

01:31:01.235 --> 01:31:02.817
will be highly valued there.

01:31:02.819 --> 01:31:05.817
Mai Tais and surfing.

01:31:05.819 --> 01:31:08.777
Not a bad ending for a
tour of the South Pacific,

01:31:08.779 --> 01:31:10.652
right Sergeant?

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.612
I wanna go back.

01:31:24.614 --> 01:31:25.653
I'm sorry?

01:31:29.448 --> 01:31:31.865
To the frontline.

01:31:38.783 --> 01:31:40.448
That's where I'm needed.
