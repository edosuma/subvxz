00:06.423 --> 00:08.508
[eerie music playing]

00:13.638 --> 00:14.639
Mom?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.476
What are you doing in my room?

00:19.894 --> 00:20.979
Bode.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.399
[inhales deeply] What is this?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.026
Uh…

00:27.152 --> 00:29.320
Uh… I can explain.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.406
How is she here?

00:31.489 --> 00:33.074
How is she under your bed?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.202
[exhales] I was using the Timeshift Key,

00:36.286 --> 00:38.913
and I wanted to stop Dodge
from making the Demon Key,

00:38.997 --> 00:41.207
but she grabbed onto me,

00:41.291 --> 00:44.419
and I ended up
accidentally bringing her back with me.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.255
[gasps]

00:47.839 --> 00:49.340
But what happened to her?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.217
[sighs] I don't know.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.346
When we came back,
her body was just kind of limp.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.389
Limp?

00:57.640 --> 01:01.394
[sighs] Maybe it's because she's not
supposed to exist in this time?

01:02.312 --> 01:03.730
When did this happen?

01:04.314 --> 01:05.523
A few days ago.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.609
Why didn't you tell me or Kinsey?

01:07.692 --> 01:09.360
[Bode] Because I knew you'd get mad at me.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.489
I shouldn't have gone back.
It was a dumb idea.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.702
-Give me the key.
-But, Mom--

01:17.786 --> 01:18.912
Now. [scoffs]

01:21.539 --> 01:23.416
[inhales deeply]

01:23.500 --> 01:25.001
[exhales]

01:30.381 --> 01:34.094
It's bad enough that you used a key
that Duncan explicitly told you not to.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.595
But then to hide it from us?

01:35.678 --> 01:38.848
I know. I'm sorry.
Just please don't be mad at me.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.309
I'll talk to Kinsey,
tell her what happened,

01:41.810 --> 01:44.854
and then we'll figure out
what to do about… this.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.356
Okay?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.366
[sighs]

01:56.449 --> 01:59.035
[foreboding music playing]

02:04.249 --> 02:06.876
[lively instrumental music playing]

02:14.592 --> 02:16.177
-[Tyler panting]
-Are you okay?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.263
[breathing deeply]

02:20.390 --> 02:21.808
Yeah. It's just…

02:23.143 --> 02:25.103
It's just a lot to take in all at once.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.398
It's all back? You remember everything?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.692
Yeah. All of it.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.653
You don't regret it, do you?

02:33.736 --> 02:35.738
[sentimental music playing]

02:40.410 --> 02:42.954
I thought letting go of magic
would help me…

02:44.664 --> 02:45.790
take my pain away.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.542
But…

02:49.085 --> 02:51.462
But I think that pain's
always gonna be with me.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.674
At least now I can understand it.

02:54.757 --> 02:55.884
[inhales deeply]

02:56.759 --> 02:57.719
[exhales]

02:57.802 --> 02:58.720
[chuckles softly]

02:59.387 --> 03:00.763
I'm so happy you're back.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.599
I missed you.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.559
I missed you too.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.228
-[inhales deeply]
-[knocking on door]

03:09.230 --> 03:10.982
Kinsey, can we talk?

03:11.065 --> 03:13.526
It's okay. He remembers now.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.446
Oh, Tyler. I'm so glad.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.741
Wait, how… how do you know about--

03:19.824 --> 03:21.326
She used the Memory Key too.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.620
[gasps] Wow!

03:24.120 --> 03:26.831
This is amazing.
Um, I guess I really missed a lot.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.168
[Kinsey] What's wrong?

03:30.919 --> 03:32.295
[inhales] Come with me.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.675
[suspenseful music playing]

03:38.218 --> 03:39.427
[sighs]

03:41.012 --> 03:42.931
[seagulls cawing]

03:47.810 --> 03:49.687
You barely said anything in the car.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.149
There's something you're not telling me.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.485
I told you, it's okay.
We just had a fight.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.528
[Ellie] It's not okay, Rufus.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.448
He's your best friend.
How could it escalate to that?

04:04.035 --> 04:05.036
[sighs]

04:06.120 --> 04:08.039
I'm gonna call Nina
and see if Bode's calmed down.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.750
No! You'll just put her in more danger!

04:11.501 --> 04:12.585
Danger?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.005
Rufus, what is going on?

04:18.049 --> 04:19.008
[Kinsey] Holy shit!

04:19.092 --> 04:21.344
She's under his bed right now?

04:21.844 --> 04:22.762
Is she dead?

04:22.845 --> 04:24.514
There was no pulse, no movement.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.517
She seemed dead,
but the body hadn't decayed at all.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.643
That's not normal.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.312
We can't assume she's dead.
We've fallen for that one before.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.690
And he said he brought her body back
from the past,

04:33.773 --> 04:35.149
like, she traveled with him?

04:35.233 --> 04:36.943
[whispering] That's what he said.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.569
You don't believe him?

04:39.696 --> 04:42.573
He's not acting like himself.
He's hiding something.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.160
I know. Something's off with him.
I thought it was hormones or something.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.871
I thought it was about Josh,
but it's more than that.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.625
I wanna see it, the body.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.211
Not right now. Bode's in his room.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.424
[sighs] This is insane.
There's a Time Travel Key?

05:00.049 --> 05:00.925
In here.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.011
[suspenseful music playing]

05:07.557 --> 05:10.101
This key is connected
to this clock somehow.

05:11.936 --> 05:12.854
[clicking]

05:13.980 --> 05:16.357
-[clock whirring]
-Bode found it on Duncan's wedding day.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.323
What happens when the sand runs out?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.242
[Tyler] Somehow it doesn't feel
like a good thing.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.703
[Kinsey breathes deeply]

05:29.412 --> 05:30.913
I'm calling Duncan.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.833
If he used this key as a kid, he might
be able to tell us what's going on.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.836
-He's on his honeymoon in Palau.
-He's got his cell phone.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.504
[dialing]

05:38.588 --> 05:39.630
[line ringing]

05:41.758 --> 05:44.802
-[on voicemail] You've reached Duncan…
-Got his voicemail. I'll leave a message.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.680
Try not to freak him out too much,
or he'll be on the first flight back.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.766
But make sure
that he knows that it's urgent.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.059
Hey, Duncan. [sighs]

05:51.142 --> 05:54.812
Everything's okay, but can you
give me a call back as soon as you can?

05:54.896 --> 05:56.481
We found the Timeshift Key.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.734
We need to know how it works
and what the hourglass means.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.862
[door creaking]

06:07.700 --> 06:09.410
[Captain] Your time's running out.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.705
[Bode] You scared the shit out of me.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.124
-I'm tired of waiting.
-[door closes]

06:15.208 --> 06:16.501
[exhales]

06:17.502 --> 06:19.253
Did you get inside the cabinet?

06:19.337 --> 06:22.215
They aren't hiding the keys
inside there anymore.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.925
Then where are they keeping them?

06:26.719 --> 06:27.887
[sighs]

06:27.970 --> 06:28.930
I don't know yet.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.100
Hey! [grunts]

06:32.183 --> 06:34.394
You're inside a mortal's body.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.646
I could end you anytime.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.816
Just, please! Give me more time
to find their hiding spot!

06:39.899 --> 06:41.484
You said they trusted you.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.694
You promised results.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.779
And I will deliver!

06:44.862 --> 06:49.075
Why should I wait when I can just
force the Lockes to tell me right now?

06:49.158 --> 06:52.161
Because they'll protect the keys
at all costs!

06:52.245 --> 06:55.957
If you play that card,
you may never find the keys.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.959
[Captain grunts]

06:58.876 --> 07:00.128
-[grunts]
-[Bode sighs]

07:00.795 --> 07:03.631
[Captain] I'll return with my men
tonight after sundown.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.010
Do not fail me.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.265
-[key cranking]
-[whooshing]

07:16.811 --> 07:18.020
[sighs]

07:19.439 --> 07:20.565
[sighs]

07:20.648 --> 07:22.650
[pensive music playing]

07:55.600 --> 07:58.978
Okay, let's say
Dodge did time travel with Bode.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.230
It still doesn't explain
why he's acting so off.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.024
Or what happened to her body.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.735
Maybe using the key
changed Bode in some way?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.154
Duncan say anything else
when he found the key?

08:08.237 --> 08:10.239
No. Just that he shouldn't
play around with it.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.908
[Bode] What are you guys doing?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.788
Hey, bud. Good news! Tyler's back.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.041
I can see that.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.792
I mean, we used the Memory Key on him.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.004
Yeah, um, Mom and Kins
have been bringing me up to speed.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.882
You guys have been
up to a lot around here.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.926
Yeah, some of us more than others.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.011
How could you
keep the Timeshift Key from me?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.013
Um, I'm sorry.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.807
Have you seen this hourglass?

08:38.726 --> 08:41.896
It started running
after I used the Timeshift Key.

08:42.939 --> 08:46.359
[Tyler] Do you know anything about it?
Like what happens when it runs out?

08:46.859 --> 08:48.110
No idea.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.446
What happened to your Switch?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.198
[sighs]

08:52.281 --> 08:54.992
I got so mad at myself
for lying to you guys

08:55.076 --> 08:58.287
that I threw my Switch
across the room, and it broke.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.835
What you did was wrong,
but you don't have to punish yourself.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.213
Can we fix it?

09:08.881 --> 09:11.300
-Sure.
-Great. I'll go get the Mending Key.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.970
It's in the chest
down in the basement, right?

09:15.346 --> 09:16.180
Yeah.

09:16.264 --> 09:20.977
So, can I get the key to the chest
so I can get it?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.564
I'll help fix your Switch.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.941
But first, I need to finish
catching Tyler up on everything.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.860
-It'll only take a minute.
-Hey, you're the one who broke the rules.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.529
You can wait five minutes, okay?

09:32.113 --> 09:34.407
[Nina] Why don't I make you some food
while you wait?

09:34.490 --> 09:36.701
You know, you haven't had anything
to eat all day.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.538
Fine, but then we're gonna
get the Mending Key, right?

09:40.621 --> 09:41.831
Definitely.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.375
[suspicious music playing]

09:52.008 --> 09:53.301
[Ellie] This can't be right.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.678
They… They got rid of Dodge.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.972
I know, Mom. I can't explain it.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.517
But she's back somehow.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.936
And she possessed Bode.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.024
-But how?
-I know it seems insane.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.777
But he knows things that only Dodge knows.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.906
And when I confronted him about it,
he told me if I said anything,

10:16.866 --> 10:18.618
he'd hurt you and Nina.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.787
[sighs]

10:21.871 --> 10:24.790
Nina said that Bode
hasn't been acting like himself.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.293
Because he's not himself.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.920
I know what I saw and what I heard.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.092
-I'm calling Nina.
-Mom!

10:35.176 --> 10:36.927
I won't tell her you said anything.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.638
Don't worry.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.059
[Nina] What are you hungry for?

10:43.976 --> 10:44.977
Mac and cheese?

10:45.061 --> 10:48.689
Maybe some tacos?
I don't really have a lot here.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.192
Just something quick.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.278
Something quick. Coming right up.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.739
[fridge door closes]

10:58.991 --> 11:01.535
I'm surprised Kinsey wasn't more mad.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.080
We've all made our mistakes with the keys.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.625
I think she was just more concerned
about making sure Tyler's okay right now.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.503
[phone vibrating]

11:11.212 --> 11:13.172
[chopping]

11:13.255 --> 11:15.591
[line ringing]

11:15.675 --> 11:17.760
-[phone continues vibrating]
-[cutlery clinking]

11:22.932 --> 11:25.226
[on voicemail] Hi, you've reached Nina.
Leave a message.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.977
[texting]

11:29.814 --> 11:31.982
[foreboding music playing]

11:40.116 --> 11:40.991
[Kinsey] Wow.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.244
[Tyler] That's… That's definitely Dodge.

11:44.829 --> 11:45.913
Ty, careful.

11:49.667 --> 11:55.381
Mom was right. There's no pulse,
but she doesn't seem dead, exactly.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.050
I don't see any wounds.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.052
[Kinsey] She's not rotting.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.638
Just looks…

12:04.765 --> 12:06.434
Like a sock without a foot in it.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.810
What?

12:07.893 --> 12:11.147
That's what a body looks like after
it hits the threshold of the Ghost Door.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.524
Oh my God.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.528
Bode had the Ghost Key on him right
around the time he started acting weird.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.365
Because he's not Bode anymore.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.410
Then Bode is…

12:24.493 --> 12:26.704
-[ice crackling]
-Kinsey, look.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.880
A ghost.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.141
What are they doing up there?

12:47.224 --> 12:49.602
Kinsey's probably showing him
the new keys.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.773
Aren't the keys down in the basement,
inside the chest?

12:54.356 --> 12:56.108
This is a big change for Tyler.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.029
I'm sure she's just trying
to help him process it all,

13:00.571 --> 13:01.947
like what happened to Jackie.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.783
His fault, by the way.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.867
What was that?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.494
Nothing.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.334
Can't you open the chest
and give me the Mending Key?

13:14.460 --> 13:19.006
I wish I could, but, um,
I don't have the key to the chest.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.509
Then ask Kinsey to give it to me.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.135
She'll be down any minute.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.055
Now, what do you want on your tacos?

13:26.639 --> 13:27.515
Whatever.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.308
[Nina] No one's mad at you.

13:29.391 --> 13:34.021
We're just, um, a little confused
about how the Timeshift Key works.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.775
What do you think the hourglass means?

13:41.612 --> 13:42.571
Bode?

13:46.700 --> 13:47.910
Where'd you go?

13:48.619 --> 13:50.704
-[Bode] Right here.
-[gasps]

13:50.788 --> 13:53.457
Enough of this bullshit!
Give me the key to the chest!

13:53.541 --> 13:54.667
Bode, stop!

13:54.750 --> 13:56.502
I'm not your dumbass little B--

13:56.585 --> 13:58.796
-[chain rattling]
-[grunting]

14:00.798 --> 14:02.758
-He's Dodge!
-What?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.594
Dodge stole his body!
Bode's out there as a ghost.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.054
What did you do to him?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.639
So, no tacos, then?

14:08.722 --> 14:10.641
Go ahead! Choke me to death!

14:10.724 --> 14:13.394
And then your poor boy's gone forever!

14:13.477 --> 14:15.354
Stop! He's right. We can't hurt him.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.023
Relax. Your twerp is fine!

14:18.107 --> 14:21.026
But right now, you need to listen to me.
This is serious.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.863
-Not happening.
-You're going back through the Ghost Door.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.323
You need me! Gideon is coming!

14:26.407 --> 14:27.241
Who's Gideon?

14:27.324 --> 14:31.036
The guy who broke into your house
and is trying to steal all the keys!

14:31.120 --> 14:33.038
You'd say anything
to save your ass right now!

14:33.122 --> 14:34.790
-[Tyler grunts]
-[yelling]

14:34.874 --> 14:35.916
You don't get it!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.919
He's a way more powerful demon
than even me!

14:39.003 --> 14:41.171
He's like a god where I come from,

14:41.255 --> 14:44.633
and now he's got the body
of some Revolutionary War captain!

14:44.717 --> 14:47.094
-Revolutionary War? The buckle.
-[Bode grunting]

14:48.679 --> 14:51.807
I'm telling the truth!
He's trying to merge our two worlds,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.809
ours and yours.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.061
And he needs all the keys to do it!

14:56.145 --> 14:59.481
I've been trying to get the Alpha Key
so I can stop him!

14:59.565 --> 15:02.026
Stop one of your own
from total domination?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.944
Right. That sounds like
something you'd do.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.572
He wants to destroy this world!

15:06.655 --> 15:08.616
But I actually like Meatworld!

15:08.699 --> 15:10.409
-Meatworld?
-Okay, enough!

15:10.492 --> 15:13.078
We'll deal with this Gideon guy
after we get our brother back.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.496
[Bode] Ahh!

15:14.580 --> 15:15.497
[grunting]

15:15.581 --> 15:16.999
You're making a huge mistake!

15:17.082 --> 15:18.792
[Tyler and Bode grunting]

15:18.876 --> 15:19.835
[Bode grunts]

[rumbling]

15:26.759 --> 15:28.218
[panting]

15:28.302 --> 15:29.261
What the hell?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.554
[creaking]

15:30.638 --> 15:31.889
What's happening? [pants]

15:32.431 --> 15:34.141
[creaking continues]

15:34.224 --> 15:36.393
It's Gideon. He's here.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.479
[foreboding music playing]

15:50.741 --> 15:53.160
[animal barking, howling]

15:54.995 --> 15:56.914
I've closed off all the exits.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.668
The only way in or out
is through the front door.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.296
Good work.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.924
[dark music playing]

16:07.007 --> 16:09.051
Now we force their surrender.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.722
He's out there with his two cronies.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.393
We've got the keys.
It's three against three.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.520
Four. I'm on your side.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.938
-Yeah. Sure.
-[Bode] I am.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.274
I just told you, I don't want Gideon
to end up with the keys.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.194
He asked me where they're hidden,
and I lied to him.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.278
That's bullshit.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.866
Look, he has the power
to destroy your world,

16:32.950 --> 16:34.785
and I want him gone.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.370
We have to work together.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.337
[clicking and cranking]

16:46.922 --> 16:48.340
[Tyler] We need to Alpha Key Gideon.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.884
It's the only way to rid him of the demon
attached to him.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.053
What about his guys? The Echoes?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.764
We find a way to throw them
across the well house threshold.

16:55.848 --> 17:00.185
-Can't we get rid of Gideon that way too?
-With his demon strength? Good luck.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.895
That's what you call helping?

17:01.979 --> 17:05.482
If you just give me the Alpha Key,
I could get close to him.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.401
-He thinks I'm his ally.
-No way.

17:07.484 --> 17:11.071
You're lucky we're not stuffing you
in this chest until everything's over.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.282
We can't trust you
with a key this important.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.867
[Tyler] We're gonna divide and conquer.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.454
We take what we need, and the rest,
we're gonna keep locked in here.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.499
[sighs] Fine, but you need to
give me something

17:22.583 --> 17:26.503
unless you want your brother's body
getting ripped to shreds by a bayonet.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.925
[sighs] Voicemail again.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.385
What should we do?

17:33.969 --> 17:35.512
I think I should just drive over there.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.098
-I'm coming with you.
-No, Rufus. It's too risky.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.892
I'm not letting you go alone.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.020
[sighs]

17:43.562 --> 17:44.521
Okay, let's go.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.237
Don't think they're fixing
to surrender, Captain.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.363
No.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.783
Let's move.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.618
What of the boy?

17:58.494 --> 17:59.411
Find him.

18:00.829 --> 18:01.747
Kill him.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.957
[dark music playing]

18:13.842 --> 18:15.094
[music stops abruptly]

18:15.177 --> 18:16.637
You check upstairs.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.390
Bolton.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.268
We'll cover this floor.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.146
[suspenseful music playing]

18:47.918 --> 18:49.503
Where are they?

19:02.683 --> 19:05.394
[Coffey] Captain! I found a dead girl!

19:05.477 --> 19:07.062
The Locke girl?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.856
No, someone else.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.484
Awful pretty though.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.322
Unless she has any keys on her,
keep looking!

Even if I told you, it wouldn't matter.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.151
You can't take them from us.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.043
You're welcome. Come on. Let's get you up.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.963
We need to Alpha Key Gideon. [grunts]

I want him gone just as much as you do
so I can enjoy Meatworld in peace.

Then after,
you'll let us restore our brother?

26:02.143 --> 26:05.522
Do you think I wanna be stuck
in this body forever?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.209
Don't worry. We're in this together.

26:30.046 --> 26:32.841
Do not let anything happen
to my brother's body.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.219
I won't, but I need to find out
where Gideon is first.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.683
-[clicking]
-[wings whooshing]

26:44.227 --> 26:46.229
[panting]

26:52.986 --> 26:55.280
[suspenseful music playing]

26:57.115 --> 26:59.117
[Nina breathing heavily]

27:03.496 --> 27:04.497
[gasps]

27:11.755 --> 27:14.716
[music intensifies]

27:17.886 --> 27:19.304
[sighs]

27:23.516 --> 27:25.935
-[wings flapping]
-What are you doing?

27:26.811 --> 27:29.105
I'm looking for Gideon. Have you seen him?

27:29.189 --> 27:31.524
No. He was downstairs, but he ran out.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.693
-Where's Kinsey?
-[gun fires]

27:33.777 --> 27:36.488
[screaming]

27:36.571 --> 27:39.658
No! No! [sobs]

27:40.450 --> 27:42.744
-[Nina sobs]
-[breathing heavily]

27:43.495 --> 27:45.205
-[whimpers]
-Mom, what happened?

27:45.288 --> 27:46.539
Gideon shot him!

27:46.623 --> 27:48.958
[accelerating music playing]

27:49.042 --> 27:50.168
[grunting]

27:51.795 --> 27:54.547
[grunting, groaning]

27:55.965 --> 27:59.177
-[grunts]
-I never should have trusted you.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.348
-[gun cocking]
-You betrayed me.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.683
I have more keys!

28:04.766 --> 28:05.767
Look!

28:06.601 --> 28:08.603
[panting]

28:11.272 --> 28:12.399
[grunts]

28:15.652 --> 28:19.114
Wait, stop! I know where the rest are!
They're down in the basement!

28:19.197 --> 28:21.324
You've worn out your usefulness.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.159
-[whimpers]
-[door opens]

28:23.243 --> 28:26.454
-Stop!
-We'll give you the keys! [panting]

28:29.374 --> 28:31.209
They're in a chest in the basement.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.754
You can open it with this. Just…

28:35.839 --> 28:37.006
Just let him go.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.675
[exhales]

28:45.724 --> 28:47.726
[breathing heavily]

28:50.895 --> 28:52.313
I'll let him go.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.860
But only after I open the chest,

28:57.736 --> 28:59.696
and I see the keys myself.

29:06.494 --> 29:07.495
Okay.

29:10.957 --> 29:13.835
-[Captain] All right, get up.
-[groaning]

29:14.794 --> 29:16.463
-[grunts]
-Let's go.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.716
We're all going back inside.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.778
[Duncan] Hey, sorry I missed your call.
Reception, it's terrible here.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.988
I told Bode
not to screw around with that key,

29:42.071 --> 29:43.782
but I guess he didn't listen.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.784
Hope he's not causing too much trouble.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.870
The hourglass is a fail-safe of sorts.

29:49.412 --> 29:52.207
Anything brought into our time
that isn't supposed to be there

29:52.290 --> 29:55.543
will vanish when the sand runs out
to prevent a paradox.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.714
It'll just go poof,
like it was never there to begin with.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.929
[breathing heavily]

30:10.058 --> 30:11.226
[key clinking]

30:11.893 --> 30:13.645
[clicking and cranking]

30:19.901 --> 30:22.028
[dramatic music plays]

30:23.613 --> 30:24.572
[Captain] Bolton.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.201
Gather the keys.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.286
[dramatic music continues]

30:39.504 --> 30:41.506
[Kinsey panting]

30:44.259 --> 30:45.927
Thank God you're okay.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.763
Kinsey, we had to give him the keys
to protect Bode.

30:51.057 --> 30:51.891
What's wrong?

30:52.934 --> 30:54.561
[Kinsey] Duncan called back.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.646
You were right. It's not good.

30:56.729 --> 30:58.731
[music continues]

31:07.699 --> 31:09.242
[clock ticking]

31:10.243 --> 31:11.828
-Gideon!
-[Bode yelling]

31:12.328 --> 31:13.788
-No!
-Bode!

31:17.584 --> 31:18.543
Alas.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.798
What a shame.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.884
[all panting]

31:28.678 --> 31:30.763
[laughing]

31:31.514 --> 31:33.516
[all gasping]

31:36.227 --> 31:38.229
[magical whoosh]

31:38.313 --> 31:40.315
[rumbling]

31:41.107 --> 31:42.609
[objects rattling]

31:45.778 --> 31:47.030
[gasping]

31:48.364 --> 31:50.366
[rumbling continues]

31:51.701 --> 31:52.869
[glass shattering]

31:52.952 --> 31:54.329
[Tyler gasps]

31:54.412 --> 31:56.414
[rhythmic humming]

32:04.005 --> 32:06.424
The end of this world

32:07.759 --> 32:09.093
is upon us!

32:09.177 --> 32:11.220
[loud whoosh]

32:13.556 --> 32:14.641
What was that?

32:15.391 --> 32:16.559
Oh God.

32:18.061 --> 32:18.978
No.

32:19.062 --> 32:22.398
-[rhythmic humming continues]
-[rumbling]

32:24.400 --> 32:25.526
Can you run?

32:25.610 --> 32:26.486
I can try.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.238
We have to go! Now! Now!

32:29.322 --> 32:32.367
[dramatic music playing]

32:34.410 --> 32:36.412
-[Nina whimpering]
-[all panting]

32:52.470 --> 32:54.555
[lively instrumental music playing]
