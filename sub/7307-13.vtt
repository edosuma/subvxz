WEBVTT

00:02.810 --> 00:04.886
Near miss. Near miss.

00:04.979 --> 00:07.351
Target not acquired, taking fire.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.978
Near miss. Taking fire. Reload.

00:10.068 --> 00:13.900
- Dude, you so suck!
- This machine sucks! It's impossible!

00:13.988 --> 00:16.064
You're hit. Game over.

00:16.157 --> 00:18.695
Insert 50 cents to continue.

00:19.035 --> 00:21.490
No way.
You still owe me $3 for the tacos.

00:21.579 --> 00:22.658
Screw it. You know what?

00:22.747 --> 00:25.119
The damn thing's rigged
to make you lose anyway.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.247
Kill shot! Kill shot!

00:27.585 --> 00:30.337
Target destroyed! Kill shot!

00:30.755 --> 00:34.124
Kill shot! Kill shot!
Bonus level! Kill shot!

00:34.425 --> 00:36.750
Kill shot! Kill shot!

00:36.844 --> 00:38.255
Kill shot! Kill shot!

00:38.346 --> 00:39.508
High score.

00:39.597 --> 00:40.712
Mission accomplished.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.598
You are the new high scorer.

00:51.442 --> 00:55.522
So, you're telling me if we sign up now,
you can guarantee us we go to Hawaii?

00:55.613 --> 00:58.104
Let's just say,
you sign an open contract,

00:58.199 --> 01:01.650
I will bust my ass
to get you any duty station you want.

01:01.869 --> 01:03.613
Hawaii, Italy,

01:03.955 --> 01:05.153
Spain...

01:05.706 --> 01:06.786
Iraq?

01:07.625 --> 01:11.124
I ain't gonna lie to you, boys.
Iraq might be a problem.

01:11.838 --> 01:16.250
What with boot camp, SOI,
follow-on schools.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.963
We're talking
over a year and a half of training.

01:19.137 --> 01:22.636
Iraq will pretty much be over
by the time you boys graduate.

01:22.723 --> 01:23.838
Sorry.

01:24.725 --> 01:27.810
You were talking
about wanting to go there, right?

01:27.895 --> 01:29.687
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

01:30.523 --> 01:33.061
Truth is most Marines
don't see combat.

01:33.151 --> 01:35.820
I mean, look at me.
Been in the corps 16 years.

01:35.903 --> 01:38.311
Closest I've ever come to a bullet is...

02:30.425 --> 02:31.504
All right.

02:32.468 --> 02:34.295
So what happened next?

02:35.346 --> 02:37.138
If it's any consolation, Gibbs,

02:37.557 --> 02:41.389
Gunnery Sergeant Alvarez's death
was almost instantaneous.

02:41.477 --> 02:44.147
CO's on the way down here, Duck.
Can we move him yet?

02:44.230 --> 02:46.686
We can't place him
on the gurney until we take pictures,

02:46.774 --> 02:48.935
and Gerald has the camera
and he's nowhere to be found.

02:49.027 --> 02:50.272
Can we hurry it up?

02:50.361 --> 02:54.489
I don't think Gunnery Sergeant Alvarez
would appreciate being seen like this.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.483
- You knew the man?
- No.

02:58.286 --> 03:02.497
But if it's any consolation, Gunny,
Gibbs is the absolute best we got.

03:03.541 --> 03:05.997
My assistant, on the other hand...

03:06.085 --> 03:09.371
Excuse me.
But that's the problem today, isn't it?

03:09.464 --> 03:13.413
Yeah, the technological advances
of the so-called Internet generation,

03:13.509 --> 03:18.136
with their MP3 players,
their iPods and video games.

03:18.389 --> 03:21.675
Spinning themselves
into a self-induced state

03:21.768 --> 03:24.259
of Attention Deficit Disorder.

03:24.354 --> 03:26.726
They're barely absorbing
one cluster of information,

03:26.814 --> 03:28.474
before the next one strikes their fancy.

03:28.566 --> 03:30.772
DiNozzo, where's my bullet?

03:30.860 --> 03:33.268
Hopefully in this box
or the wall behind it.

03:33.363 --> 03:35.154
Got your knife on you, boss?

03:36.032 --> 03:38.072
Rule number nine,
never go anywhere without a knife.

03:38.117 --> 03:39.470
Never go anywhere without a knife.

03:39.494 --> 03:40.656
You sure about that?

03:40.745 --> 03:43.140
I thought nine was never ask a girl
her weight on a first date.

03:43.164 --> 03:45.768
Well, that depends entirely on
if you want a second one or not, Tony.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.990
What do you got, Kate?

03:47.085 --> 03:48.405
Well, the kids can't tell us much

03:48.461 --> 03:50.917
except for where Alvarez was sitting
when he was popped.

03:51.005 --> 03:52.797
Several people
reported hearing a gunshot

03:52.882 --> 03:55.290
around 1300, but no eyewitnesses.

03:55.927 --> 03:58.881
I bet you had no problem getting dates
wearing one of these, Gibbs.

03:58.971 --> 04:01.723
Dating was not exactly my problem
in the corps, DiNozzo.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.429
- What'd the LEO say?
- It might be gang-related.

04:04.519 --> 04:06.428
Alvarez had a couple run-ins
with the locals.

04:06.521 --> 04:08.921
Last month they threw a cinder block
through the window here.

04:08.981 --> 04:11.354
Well, if it was gangbangers,
they're packing serious heat.

04:11.442 --> 04:12.920
It went straight through the sheetrock

04:12.944 --> 04:16.063
into what looks like
some kind of toy warehouse?

04:16.154 --> 04:17.733
Give me my knife back.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.401
You two better get moving.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.697
Don't come back without my bullet.

04:26.082 --> 04:28.869
You think he'd let me
borrow his uniform for a weekend?

04:28.960 --> 04:31.533
I don't know.
I just hope I'm there when you ask him.

04:34.298 --> 04:36.505
Where on earth did he put the gurney?

04:36.592 --> 04:39.712
I swear, if he's lost inside
that MP3 again...

04:39.804 --> 04:42.211
I got the rest of those photos
that you asked for.

04:42.306 --> 04:45.142
And Gibbs said that he wanted
Gunnery Sergeant Alvarez out quick,

04:45.226 --> 04:47.551
so I staged the gurney near his body.

04:57.822 --> 04:59.613
Did you ever play with one of these
as a kid?

04:59.699 --> 05:01.241
Do I look like the doll type, Tony?

05:01.325 --> 05:03.995
Well, maybe if you smiled more
and did something with your hair.

05:04.078 --> 05:06.700
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes.

05:06.956 --> 05:08.865
- We're with NCIS.
- It stands for...

05:08.958 --> 05:10.785
Naval Criminal Investigative Service,
yeah.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.750
Yeah, I'm Carl. AWM.

05:13.296 --> 05:16.047
- Assistant Warehouse Manager.
- You've heard of us.

05:16.132 --> 05:17.792
I watch Forensic Files on Court TV.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.172
They profiled a case
your department did a few years ago.

05:20.261 --> 05:22.170
- Really?
- Yeah. You guys couldn't solve it.

05:22.263 --> 05:24.090
So they brought in the FBI
and those guys...

05:24.182 --> 05:25.925
I don't have cable, Carl.

05:26.017 --> 05:27.808
We're here on official business.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.304
Oh, about the murder next door?

05:29.395 --> 05:32.235
Not that we know it's a murder yet,
but from all preliminary indications

05:32.273 --> 05:33.375
it appears that it's probably...

05:33.399 --> 05:35.294
Bullet went through the common wall
into your warehouse.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.004
We need to forensically
trace its trajectory.

05:37.028 --> 05:38.190
Not a problem.

05:38.279 --> 05:42.277
You gonna use the laser pointer,
or the more outdated string technique?

05:57.131 --> 05:59.040
- Major Dougherty?
- Yes?

06:00.092 --> 06:02.299
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

06:04.305 --> 06:07.389
Five months in Iraq,
I didn't lose a single man.

06:07.475 --> 06:09.764
What can you tell me
about the Gunnery Sergeant?

06:09.852 --> 06:11.761
Well, he was a legend.

06:12.188 --> 06:14.477
A career recruiter
who never missed a quota.

06:14.565 --> 06:15.894
Any ideas?

06:16.651 --> 06:19.687
We've had some trouble with gangs
in the neighbourhood.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.059
Vandalism, mostly.

06:21.155 --> 06:22.876
They don't like it
when the kids around here

06:22.907 --> 06:24.946
choose a career
over hanging out on street corners.

06:25.034 --> 06:27.988
What about complaints
filed from the kids he did recruit?

06:28.079 --> 06:29.787
- We had a few.
- I'll need to see those.

06:29.872 --> 06:32.363
- Not a problem.
- The real ones, Major.

06:32.458 --> 06:35.376
The ones that tend to surface
when you don't make your quota.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.288
Hell, if it helps you find his killer,

06:37.380 --> 06:40.084
I'll give you his whole damn
filing cabinet, Agent Gibbs.

06:40.174 --> 06:41.455
All right.

06:42.677 --> 06:45.631
Where the hell is the bullet?
It's like it just disappeared.

06:45.721 --> 06:47.642
I'm gonna need you
on your knees over here, Kate.

06:47.682 --> 06:49.508
- It's time to get dirty.
- What?

06:50.017 --> 06:53.766
We have to sweep the floor for marks.
It may have lost velocity and dropped.

06:54.105 --> 06:56.014
Right. I knew that.

06:59.277 --> 07:01.732
That's not how they do it on CSI.

07:02.863 --> 07:05.948
You really need
to get off that couch more, Carl.

07:06.576 --> 07:10.620
Was there a pallet or a display,
like, right around here,

07:10.705 --> 07:12.697
say, 1:00 this afternoon?

07:14.667 --> 07:15.746
Carl!

07:18.004 --> 07:19.961
Yeah. It went out about an hour ago.

07:20.047 --> 07:22.170
It was a load of dolls
heading for Richmond.

07:22.258 --> 07:24.334
Can you contact the driver?

07:24.427 --> 07:25.506
Sure.

07:26.596 --> 07:29.550
Good, 'cause we got a new address
for drop off.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.549
A little present for you.

07:32.226 --> 07:33.471
Okay, what is it?

07:33.561 --> 07:36.230
Seven years' worth
of Gunnery Sergeant Alvarez's

07:36.314 --> 07:37.974
personal and professional
correspondence.

07:38.065 --> 07:39.809
It's sorted by category.

07:40.109 --> 07:43.063
- Which are?
- Gonna leave that part of it up to you.

07:43.154 --> 07:45.989
Oh, come on, Gibbs.
At least tell me what I'm looking for?

07:46.073 --> 07:49.240
Same thing we're all looking for, Kate.
A murderer.

07:50.453 --> 07:53.074
Why didn't I take the damn dolls?

07:54.457 --> 07:57.956
Is there a reason
you pulled all their heads off, Abby?

07:58.044 --> 07:59.917
It's so we know
that we've checked them.

08:00.004 --> 08:03.254
Yeah, but the one with the round in it
was sitting practically on top.

08:03.341 --> 08:05.167
You emptied the entire box.

08:05.259 --> 08:08.426
Well, it was kind of fun.

08:08.763 --> 08:10.257
And they're naked.

08:11.098 --> 08:14.183
I am about to perform my first autopsy.

08:29.367 --> 08:32.118
Gerald. To Abby, please.

08:33.453 --> 08:36.123
- Does Ducky know you do that?
- Hey, Gibbs.

08:36.207 --> 08:38.828
I was just about to run this
through the ballistics lab.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.708
Good, because when you're done,

08:40.794 --> 08:43.546
I want to see that mock-up
of the trajectory on the computer.

08:43.631 --> 08:45.090
And I'm gone.

08:46.926 --> 08:50.461
- Why are all these dolls naked?
- Don't look at me, boss.

08:51.013 --> 08:52.805
Must be a Goth thing.

08:58.813 --> 09:01.220
It definitely wasn't a pistol, Gibbs.

09:01.315 --> 09:03.723
- 7.62 millimetres.
- A rifle.

09:03.984 --> 09:06.191
The problem is I can't tell which kind.

09:06.278 --> 09:08.070
Hopefully I can look it up on the plates.

09:08.155 --> 09:10.231
Then why don't you start
with what it's not, Abby?

09:10.324 --> 09:12.400
Well, I know it's not an AK-47.

09:12.493 --> 09:15.245
There's lots of those
floating around D.C.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.248
The grooving's all wrong.

09:18.332 --> 09:20.823
Without knowing
the exact make of the rifle,

09:20.918 --> 09:22.496
I'm going on guess work,

09:22.586 --> 09:24.994
but I think it explains
why there's no eyewitnesses.

09:25.089 --> 09:26.464
Every rifle has a certain range

09:26.549 --> 09:29.336
where they experience
maximum penetration power.

09:29.427 --> 09:31.707
It has to do with the ammo load,
the length of the barrel,

09:31.762 --> 09:33.506
and the rifling.

09:33.848 --> 09:36.683
We know our round
went through a Marine,

09:36.767 --> 09:40.931
ricocheted off an office chair,
through a box, a sheetrock wall,

09:41.021 --> 09:42.895
and ended up in our doll's head.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.307
There's no way that shot
came from just outside the window

09:45.401 --> 09:47.310
or even across the street.

09:50.781 --> 09:53.984
The shooter was long-range.
Really long-range.

09:55.870 --> 09:57.779
Our shooter's a sniper.

10:03.569 --> 10:04.683
Relax your hand,

10:04.778 --> 10:06.506
or you're never going
to get it in your mouth.

10:06.530 --> 10:08.404
I'm trying,
but this thing's too damn slippery.

10:08.490 --> 10:10.317
You're never going
to impress a girl that way.

10:10.409 --> 10:11.820
Oh, whatever.

10:11.994 --> 10:14.948
Just promise me the next time
we decide to do this, Kate,

10:15.038 --> 10:16.746
make sure that they

10:16.915 --> 10:18.789
don't forget the forks.

10:25.007 --> 10:26.833
No one likes a show off.

10:26.925 --> 10:28.918
Screw this. Got any soup?

10:36.393 --> 10:40.094
- That had better not be mine, DiNozzo.
- Gibbs ordered soup?

10:40.898 --> 10:42.060
Great.

10:42.774 --> 10:45.645
If it's any consolation it's not very good.

10:47.196 --> 10:48.903
- Whose chow mein?
- Tony's.

10:48.989 --> 10:50.068
Good.

10:50.908 --> 10:54.359
So, anything interesting
in Alvarez's complaint file?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.612
Well, it seems he had a gift
for exaggerating

10:56.705 --> 10:58.863
the opportunities available
in the Marine Corps.

10:58.957 --> 11:00.535
You'll like this one, boss.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.120
One guy wanted to be a paramedic,

11:02.211 --> 11:06.457
so Alvarez guaranteed him
the corps would train him to save lives.

11:07.883 --> 11:09.163
What's wrong with that?

11:09.259 --> 11:11.667
The Marine Corps
doesn't have medical personnel.

11:11.762 --> 11:14.549
- They're all Navy.
- Technically, he is correct.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.348
I mean, Marines do save lives,

11:16.433 --> 11:19.351
mostly through the use
of superior firepower.

11:19.436 --> 11:22.354
Well, that's pretty much his M.O.
The bait and switch.

11:22.981 --> 11:24.890
This kid wanted to be a pilot.

11:24.983 --> 11:28.317
Alvarez told him that he'd be sitting
in a cockpit by his second year.

11:28.403 --> 11:31.570
- Plane mechanic?
- Close. Ejection seat technician.

11:32.324 --> 11:35.195
- Any of them contain threats?
- No. Not yet at least.

11:35.285 --> 11:38.820
You know, come to think of it, you never
told us why you enlisted, boss.

11:38.914 --> 11:41.072
That's because it's personal.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.281
Gibbs.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.743
You think his recruiter
told him a fast one?

11:46.129 --> 11:47.754
- I doubt it.
- Why?

11:47.839 --> 11:51.422
Can you imagine someone
lying to Gibbs and getting away with it?

11:51.510 --> 11:52.541
Yep.

11:53.053 --> 11:57.631
That's our authorisation for the building
Abby thinks the sniper fired from.

11:59.351 --> 12:00.762
DiNozzo, you're with me.

12:00.852 --> 12:02.644
- What about me?
- Nope.

12:02.729 --> 12:06.478
You need to see if there's a murderer
hiding in that stack of files.

12:13.949 --> 12:15.277
Good luck.

12:17.661 --> 12:20.033
Alone, eating Chinese food again.

12:20.330 --> 12:23.117
What a refreshing change, Kate.

12:27.754 --> 12:29.747
Well, it's a nice neighbourhood.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.879
A couple of coats of paint,

12:32.009 --> 12:33.586
maybe a bulldozer.

12:33.969 --> 12:36.674
You're looking at the reason
Alvarez made quota every month.

12:36.763 --> 12:38.590
Actually, I think I'm looking at vomit.

12:38.682 --> 12:41.303
He was trying to give these kids
a real chance to get out of here.

12:41.393 --> 12:42.887
The problem is,

12:43.437 --> 12:46.307
some of them were too young
or ignorant to realise it.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.640
Maybe, but you gotta admit
he had a unique approach.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.726
- You got a key?
- Right here.

12:53.655 --> 12:55.315
The thing is stuck.

12:56.283 --> 12:57.825
Give me a try.

13:11.381 --> 13:14.252
Hey, DiNozzo,
kind of reminds me of your apartment.

13:14.343 --> 13:17.213
Except for that minty-fresh urine smell.

13:17.304 --> 13:19.095
For your information, I have a maid now.

13:19.181 --> 13:20.509
You can afford a maid?

13:20.599 --> 13:23.683
It's amazing what you can do when
you don't have to pay three alimonies.

13:26.521 --> 13:28.597
Oh, this doesn't make any sense.

13:28.690 --> 13:31.015
Sure this is the wall
facing the recruiting station?

13:31.109 --> 13:32.568
Yeah. Northeast.

13:32.652 --> 13:34.526
Abby's trajectory's gotta be wrong.

13:34.613 --> 13:37.697
How could a guy fire from here?
There isn't even a window.

13:37.783 --> 13:38.981
I don't know.

13:39.076 --> 13:42.195
That's what we're gonna find out.
Let's get busy.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.370
"Minty-fresh urine smell."

13:52.547 --> 13:55.418
Well, I don't know what we got,
but I'm done.

13:56.218 --> 13:57.878
- Gibbs?
- DiNozzo!

13:57.969 --> 14:00.460
- Hey, you got your knife?
- Rule number nine,

14:00.555 --> 14:02.714
- never go anywhere...
- Yeah, yeah. Just testing you.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.931
Seeing if you were paying attention.

14:07.521 --> 14:10.059
What exactly are we looking for here?

14:13.276 --> 14:14.854
This right here.

14:21.576 --> 14:22.691
Okay.

14:23.286 --> 14:24.697
Let's bag it.

14:30.585 --> 14:34.286
- Oh, boy, we got a major problem.
- What do you see?

14:34.381 --> 14:37.832
A shooter who is highly intelligent
and methodical.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.340
Out of a thousand bricks in this wall,

14:42.389 --> 14:44.761
he only removed the one he needed.

15:01.116 --> 15:02.990
- Did you have fun last night?
- Oh, yeah.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.944
Got in around 4:00 a.m.
And filed evidence for another hour.

15:07.038 --> 15:09.494
- Really? Was Gibbs with you?
- Oh, God!

15:10.041 --> 15:12.959
Thanks for reminding me.
I'd better call and make sure he's up.

15:13.044 --> 15:15.796
- Hey. You're late.
- And a good morning to you, sir.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.169
Kate, you get those files sorted?

15:18.508 --> 15:22.340
Looks like we might
have had our Gunny figured wrong.

15:22.429 --> 15:25.098
These aren't complaints.

15:25.182 --> 15:26.806
They're letters thanking him.

15:26.892 --> 15:30.058
He kept in touch with a lot of his recruits
even after graduation.

15:30.145 --> 15:32.019
The middle ones
are mostly bitching and moaning

15:32.105 --> 15:33.564
along the lines of last night.

15:33.648 --> 15:36.056
And these are the two that stood out.

15:36.818 --> 15:39.309
This one sounded the most promising.

15:40.030 --> 15:41.654
I'll say.

15:41.990 --> 15:44.427
This guy is threatening
to cut off Alvarez's head, and then...

15:44.451 --> 15:46.823
Yeah. He's dead.
Six months ago in Iraq.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.821
This one is our best bet.

15:48.955 --> 15:50.829
Sergeant Aaron Barnes.

15:50.916 --> 15:54.332
He claims that Alvarez told him
that if he signed up for a six-year hitch,

15:54.419 --> 15:57.088
he'd qualify for the Marine Enlisted
Commissioning Programme.

15:57.547 --> 15:59.670
Listen, son.
You want to be an officer someday,

15:59.758 --> 16:02.039
you've got to show the Marine Corps
that you're committed.

16:02.093 --> 16:05.842
Between you and me, nothing
shows commitment like a six-year hitch.

16:06.223 --> 16:08.796
Hell, I can even see myself
saluting you some day.

16:09.434 --> 16:11.142
Turns out Barnes' high school GPA

16:11.228 --> 16:13.516
wasn't high enough
to qualify for MECEP,

16:13.605 --> 16:15.958
and when he found that out,
he wanted to break his contract.

16:15.982 --> 16:17.062
That's not gonna happen.

16:17.150 --> 16:21.195
Yeah, and when that got shot down,
he fired off a personal letter to Alvarez

16:21.279 --> 16:23.901
promising to look the Gunny up again
when his contract was up.

16:23.990 --> 16:25.568
That's not exactly a death threat.

16:25.659 --> 16:28.660
Well, his contract's up this year.
But here's the kicker.

16:28.745 --> 16:31.532
Two years ago
he was selected for sniper school

16:31.623 --> 16:34.458
and he was so good that they
brought him back as an instructor.

16:34.543 --> 16:35.918
He's there now.

16:36.670 --> 16:37.868
Let's roll.

16:41.341 --> 16:43.417
Did you have
any of that shrimp last night?

16:43.510 --> 16:45.586
How could I?
You shoved them all in your mouth.

16:45.679 --> 16:47.339
Consider yourself lucky.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.648
Adjust your mil scale!

17:05.740 --> 17:08.741
You're shooting up-slope
with a variable 10-knot wind!

17:08.827 --> 17:10.736
Close doesn't count
in combat, Corporal.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.156
Even a half-inch off your mark,

17:12.247 --> 17:14.738
your target gets the opportunity
to live and return the favour.

17:14.833 --> 17:15.912
Yes, sir!

17:17.711 --> 17:19.086
Sergeant Barnes?

17:20.088 --> 17:21.582
Stand by, gentlemen.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.752
Yes, Sergeant.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.257
Special Agent Gibbs,
Todd, DiNozzo. NCIS.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.088
What can I do for you, sir?

17:28.179 --> 17:31.928
We want to talk to you about
Gunnery Sergeant Freddy Alvarez.

17:34.728 --> 17:36.767
I guess he couldn't
get away with it forever.

17:36.855 --> 17:37.886
What?

17:37.981 --> 17:40.519
Promising things
he knew he could never deliver on, sir.

17:40.609 --> 17:43.209
The thing is, we're not here
to talk about his recruiting methods.

17:43.278 --> 17:45.078
- He was killed yesterday.
- Shot by a sniper.

17:45.155 --> 17:46.982
How many people can make that shot?

17:47.073 --> 17:50.027
600 metres, through glass. Down angle.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.614
You think it's me.

18:04.966 --> 18:07.422
I can't believe he kept this letter.

18:08.011 --> 18:09.671
You've got to believe me, sir.

18:09.763 --> 18:12.170
- It's not what you think.
- It never is.

18:12.265 --> 18:16.594
Where were you, Sergeant,
yesterday, between noon and 1400?

18:16.686 --> 18:18.478
Individual PT, sir.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.437
I ran the loop around Lunga Reservoir.

18:20.523 --> 18:23.275
- Can anyone corroborate that?
- Corporal Stenson.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.068
We work out together
every Wednesday.

18:25.153 --> 18:28.487
- Where's the corporal now?
- Running a Land Nav class in the field.

18:28.573 --> 18:30.214
I can have him call you
when he gets back.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.694
I've got a better idea.

18:31.785 --> 18:34.240
Why don't you give me
his grid coordinate

18:34.621 --> 18:35.996
and a map?

18:43.463 --> 18:45.337
You sure you know where you're going?

18:45.423 --> 18:47.297
I used to do this for a living.

18:47.550 --> 18:49.508
They had maps back then?

18:57.977 --> 18:59.218
Number one rule if you're lost,

18:59.270 --> 19:01.540
you're gonna find a mountain
and shoot a back azimuth off it.

19:01.564 --> 19:03.438
- Yes, Corporal.
- Corporal Stenson?

19:03.858 --> 19:05.518
You two work out the next azimuth.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.546
- I'll be up with you in a minute.
- Yes, Corporal.

19:07.570 --> 19:09.528
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

19:09.614 --> 19:10.729
What's up, sir?

19:10.824 --> 19:12.816
You and your people
working on some Land Nav?

19:12.909 --> 19:14.451
Among other things.

19:14.536 --> 19:17.952
Did you PT with Sergeant Barnes
yesterday afternoon?

19:18.248 --> 19:21.284
Yes, sir, every Wednesday
between noon and 1400.

19:21.376 --> 19:23.499
- What'd you do?
- We...

19:24.254 --> 19:27.041
We were running
the obstacle course, ma'am.

19:29.092 --> 19:30.716
Here it is, okay?

19:31.720 --> 19:33.712
Gunny Alvarez lied to me.

19:34.264 --> 19:37.514
It pissed me off
so I wrote him that stupid letter.

19:38.768 --> 19:40.179
But joining the Marine Corps

19:40.270 --> 19:42.512
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:44.858 --> 19:47.016
It's 68 degrees in here, Sergeant.

19:47.110 --> 19:48.308
You hot?

19:48.903 --> 19:51.192
Or do you always sweat this much?

19:51.322 --> 19:53.315
I am not a murderer, sir.

19:54.117 --> 19:56.690
You'll excuse me
if I don't take your word for it.

19:56.786 --> 19:59.704
My contract was up
the end of this year, sir.

20:00.206 --> 20:02.282
Why would I re-enlist
for another six years

20:02.375 --> 20:03.869
if I hated the Marine Corps?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.668
Maybe you just enjoy being a sniper.

20:07.046 --> 20:08.505
Get a thrill out of the fact

20:08.590 --> 20:11.045
that your target
is totally unaware of your presence.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.628
Their lives in your hands.

20:18.475 --> 20:22.638
You choosing the exact moment
you plan to end it.

20:25.315 --> 20:27.557
Do you think that Alvarez

20:27.650 --> 20:30.568
felt those crosshairs
lining up on his chest?

20:35.074 --> 20:38.693
I didn't shoot him, sir.

21:03.970 --> 21:05.927
Next time drive a little faster, Tony.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.635
I think my glands
still have an ounce of adrenaline left.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.445
Responsible crime scene investigation
demands a timely arrival, Kate.

21:11.519 --> 21:14.354
Yeah, well, it would help if the
investigators didn't puke all over it.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.767
It brings back memories.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.526
- Memories of what?
- Marriage.

21:20.486 --> 21:23.653
A second Marine recruiter was killed
while Sergeant Barnes was in custody.

21:23.740 --> 21:24.985
Why are we still holding him?

21:25.074 --> 21:27.115
Not telling the truth.
I just don't know about what.

21:27.201 --> 21:29.657
Well, he could have a partner.
Snipers like to use spotters.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.663
Why don't we see if these two shootings
are even connected?

21:35.710 --> 21:38.035
Boss, are you expecting company?

21:45.428 --> 21:47.006
The victim was a Marine.

21:47.096 --> 21:49.421
That puts it in our jurisdiction,
Agent Kramer.

21:49.515 --> 21:51.508
Maybe, but the second shooting
is in Maryland

21:51.601 --> 21:53.724
which puts it across state lines
and in ours.

21:53.811 --> 21:55.934
- According to who?
- The director of the FBI.

21:56.022 --> 21:57.813
Oh, is he here somewhere?

21:57.899 --> 21:59.299
Look, if you pull your people back,

21:59.358 --> 22:01.398
I promise you'll get copies
of everything we find.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.589
- And if I don't?
- Well, I wouldn't worry about that.

22:03.613 --> 22:07.195
You'll be receiving a call
from your director any minute now.

22:07.283 --> 22:10.734
And one more thing, Agent Gibbs,
Fornell warned me about you.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.784
Do not try and remove the body.

22:14.749 --> 22:16.576
You're not still using laser.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.162
They're still using laser.

22:18.252 --> 22:20.079
Maybe they didn't get the memo.

22:20.171 --> 22:22.164
You didn't get the memo, did you?

22:22.256 --> 22:24.415
DOJ memorandum. 12 August.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.082
Ballistic laser calibration devices?
The health warning?

22:27.178 --> 22:28.921
May lead to impotence?

22:29.097 --> 22:32.181
Maybe he doesn't have to worry
about that anymore.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.766
We can get the trajectory, no problem.

22:34.852 --> 22:36.726
Competition's gonna be for the bullet.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.852
I don't think the unfortunate
Staff Sergeant Allen

22:38.940 --> 22:40.564
is going to be of much use there.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.607
The bullet passed clean through.

22:42.693 --> 22:47.486
Then I suggest we help
our good friends, the FBI, find it.

22:47.615 --> 22:49.987
- Tony, make a hole.
- Scalpel.

22:50.076 --> 22:51.903
Kate, find the bullet.

22:55.289 --> 22:59.583
I know you find the departmental
turf wars as tedious as I do.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.660
Well, people of serious intent

23:02.839 --> 23:05.080
should never allow the frivolous
to deter them

23:05.174 --> 23:07.879
from the pursuit of justice, should they?

23:07.969 --> 23:09.249
Don't you think?

23:12.348 --> 23:14.388
I've got the secondary bullet hole, boss!

23:14.475 --> 23:16.100
All right, we'll take it from here.

23:16.185 --> 23:17.763
Oh, no. I'll wait for my boss.

23:17.854 --> 23:20.179
He's the good-looking guy
with all his hair.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.683
Tony, I'll handle this.

23:21.774 --> 23:23.933
What, you still haven't heard
from your director yet?

23:24.026 --> 23:25.818
No, and until we do,

23:25.903 --> 23:28.525
that bullet in the wall behind us
belongs to NCIS.

23:28.614 --> 23:31.449
Well, from where I'm standing,
you're a little outnumbered.

23:31.534 --> 23:35.282
Well, from where I'm standing,
I'm not real worried about it.

23:35.371 --> 23:38.076
All right, listen, Gibbs,
I don't have time for this bull!

23:38.166 --> 23:41.120
Will somebody please get me
the damn NCIS director on the phone?

23:41.210 --> 23:44.211
Well, that may be a bit of a problem
since Thursday is his golf day.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.170
Listen, I am not
fooling around anymore, Gibbs.

23:46.257 --> 23:48.962
I'm not either.
The man has a mean handicap.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.336
Yeah. Gibbs.

23:53.973 --> 23:56.096
Kate's got the bullet, boss.

23:57.977 --> 23:59.222
Yes, sir.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.266
Yes, sir.

24:02.565 --> 24:04.604
It won't happen again, sir.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.979
Looks like you win this one.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.109
Don't get used to it.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.820
Don't take it personally, Gibbs.
We all have our orders.

24:13.910 --> 24:17.029
Listen, when you see Fornell,

24:17.371 --> 24:18.949
you say hi for me.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.827
My pleasure.
You have a nice day now.

24:34.180 --> 24:35.460
Hathcock.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.551
Who's Hathcock?

24:37.642 --> 24:40.346
Carlos Hathcock.
A Marine sniper legend.

24:40.519 --> 24:42.892
Thirty-nine confirmed kills in Vietnam.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.781
What's that got to do
with the pigeon feather?

24:44.815 --> 24:46.725
It's not a pigeon feather.

24:46.817 --> 24:48.893
Look. Shaft's too small.

24:48.986 --> 24:50.860
Okay. That white bird feather.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.354
VC nicknamed Hathcock
after the small white feather

24:53.449 --> 24:55.572
he kept in the band of his hat.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.495
- History Channel?
- His biography.

25:01.207 --> 25:03.034
You read his biography?

25:03.251 --> 25:05.872
I watched his biography
on the Biography Channel.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.916
So, you think it's somehow connected
to the shooter?

25:09.006 --> 25:10.204
Don't know.

25:10.299 --> 25:12.256
If we find another one of these
that matches it

25:12.343 --> 25:14.003
in Gunnery Sergeant Alvarez's office.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.004
We'll strip search the roaches, boss.

25:16.764 --> 25:20.133
You realise what this means,
if it is some kind of a calling card?

25:20.226 --> 25:21.340
Yeah.

25:21.435 --> 25:25.018
It means he likes to meet the recruiter
before he kills him.

25:26.857 --> 25:29.858
The second bullet's
in way better shape than the first.

25:29.944 --> 25:32.020
Some of the rifling patterns
are matching up

25:32.113 --> 25:34.438
like the Glam Slam Techno Twins.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.075
Oh, sorry! Wrong generation.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.533
Think the Andrews Sisters.

25:41.205 --> 25:43.447
Going back a little far there, actually.

25:44.208 --> 25:48.075
So I don't have enough to be
100% certain that it's the same gun,

25:48.170 --> 25:50.840
but I am 100% sure it's the same model.

25:50.923 --> 25:52.999
Did you backtrack
the shooter's location yet?

25:53.092 --> 25:56.710
Looks like our shooter might be mobile.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.429
Following the trajectory in reverse,

26:01.517 --> 26:03.142
there isn't a building or a structure

26:03.227 --> 26:05.220
that makes any sense
as a shooting position.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.593
There's only road.

26:06.689 --> 26:08.563
The shooter fired from a car?

26:09.400 --> 26:11.393
Or a truck, or a van.

26:20.619 --> 26:21.948
What's up?

26:23.372 --> 26:27.417
This whole sensitivity-to-women-
in-the-workplace thing backfired.

26:27.543 --> 26:28.706
What are you talking about?

26:28.794 --> 26:30.522
I'm talking about the way
we divide our tasks.

26:30.546 --> 26:33.381
I always get the floor. Up close
and personal, floors are scummy.

26:33.466 --> 26:35.423
It's no big deal, Tony.
I would have done it.

26:36.677 --> 26:39.168
- But you didn't.
- Floors are scummy.

26:39.597 --> 26:41.257
My point exactly.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.175
You would never volunteer
to take the floor.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.430
I would have to suggest it.

26:44.518 --> 26:46.345
And then I would be met by
lots of comments

26:46.437 --> 26:48.975
about my chauvinism and insensitivity.

26:49.273 --> 26:51.147
I don't need a floor for that.

26:51.233 --> 26:54.069
Cute, but my point is
in order for me to be p.c.,

26:54.153 --> 26:55.980
I gotta take the floor.

26:58.991 --> 27:02.574
- You want me to take the floor?
- You're just saying that to humour me.

27:02.661 --> 27:04.369
No, you have a point.

27:04.455 --> 27:08.583
And if it bothers you that much,
I'll take the floor. I insist.

27:10.753 --> 27:11.916
Thanks.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.463
No problem.

27:28.896 --> 27:30.224
I've been here for three hours

27:30.314 --> 27:32.639
without anybody telling me
what's going on.

27:32.733 --> 27:35.224
You'll be here another three hours
if that's what it takes.

27:35.319 --> 27:37.027
Takes for what, sir?

27:37.113 --> 27:39.983
- You said you weren't charging me.
- Not yet.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.944
What did Corporal Stenson say
when you found him?

27:45.704 --> 27:48.077
That you two were PTing yesterday.

27:48.165 --> 27:50.372
And that's exactly what I told you, sir.

27:50.751 --> 27:52.660
Yeah, you did, Sergeant.

27:53.546 --> 27:58.457
Running the Lunga Reservoir loop
between noon and 1400.

27:58.717 --> 28:01.006
A long route, about nine miles.

28:01.345 --> 28:02.543
Yes, sir.

28:02.638 --> 28:06.470
So how come Corporal Stenson
doesn't remember making it?

28:09.437 --> 28:11.762
You don't have an alibi, Sergeant.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.144
Whether you're the shooter or not,

28:15.276 --> 28:18.111
you lied during a criminal investigation.

28:18.612 --> 28:21.732
Hey, let's discuss those charges.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.487
Rachel Hauser.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.656
What was that?

28:27.746 --> 28:29.988
Rachel Hauser, sir.

28:33.544 --> 28:35.038
When and where?

28:35.796 --> 28:37.504
Noon to 1400.

28:38.716 --> 28:41.467
Motel. Just outside the main gate.

28:41.927 --> 28:44.418
Does Rachel Hauser
have a phone number?

28:55.274 --> 28:57.350
Sir, my wife,

28:59.403 --> 29:01.028
she doesn't know.

29:01.530 --> 29:04.068
I'm just checking an alibi, Sergeant.

29:04.408 --> 29:06.448
The rest is between you and her.

29:08.829 --> 29:11.664
Gunnery Sergeant Alvarez
must have recruited the cleaning crew,

29:11.749 --> 29:14.038
because they obviously
haven't been here in a while.

29:14.126 --> 29:16.415
Maybe it blew away
after the first time we swept.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.583
A feather's light.

29:17.671 --> 29:19.691
A slight breeze could have taken it
across the room.

29:19.715 --> 29:21.957
Nah, it'd have to be
a pretty strong breeze.

29:22.051 --> 29:24.542
There's no cross-ventilation in here.

29:27.681 --> 29:29.092
Ventilation.

29:43.697 --> 29:46.449
Are we still thinking
this guy is in the military?

29:46.534 --> 29:48.325
Something tells me you don't believe it.

29:48.410 --> 29:49.525
It's the profile.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.787
This feather is our shooter's
calling card. It's like a signature.

29:52.873 --> 29:54.284
But a white feather for all we know

29:54.375 --> 29:56.083
could mean he has
a Forrest Gump fixation.

29:56.168 --> 29:58.688
Well, it doesn't matter if other people
know what the feather means.

29:58.712 --> 29:59.827
He knows.

29:59.922 --> 30:02.080
I just think this guy's living
in a fantasy world,

30:02.174 --> 30:03.527
and I can't picture him functioning

30:03.551 --> 30:06.255
in some highly organised
military environment.

30:06.345 --> 30:08.670
So you think he's ex-military,
like the Beltway sniper?

30:08.764 --> 30:11.848
Possibly. But why target
only Marine recruiters?

30:12.893 --> 30:15.100
Because they turned him down.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.649
This guy isn't military. He's a wannabe.

30:18.774 --> 30:20.482
Now that fits the profile.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.733
How many people
do the Marines turn down every year?

30:22.778 --> 30:23.809
Thousands.

30:23.904 --> 30:25.715
And by the time we get
a chance to check them out,

30:25.739 --> 30:26.841
this guy's gonna shoot again.

30:26.865 --> 30:30.032
If he continues this pattern,
we have less than 24 hours.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.870
Then maybe it's time
we got more proactive.

30:34.540 --> 30:36.579
And our heartfelt prayers and wishes

30:36.667 --> 30:39.454
go out to the families
of Gunnery Sergeant Alvarez,

30:39.545 --> 30:40.956
and Staff Sergeant Allen.

30:41.046 --> 30:43.418
We are continuing
to work with law enforcement

30:43.507 --> 30:46.591
to bring the person
or persons responsible to justice.

30:46.677 --> 30:48.551
Will the Marine Corps
suspend recruiting?

30:48.637 --> 30:49.800
Never.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.090
Marines don't run from danger.

30:52.182 --> 30:54.638
This recruitment office
will reopen tomorrow morning,

30:54.727 --> 30:58.060
manned by one of our finest,
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas.

30:58.397 --> 31:01.481
How do you feel about being selected
for this assignment, Gunnery Sergeant?

31:01.567 --> 31:03.476
I wasn't selected, sir.

31:03.569 --> 31:04.980
I volunteered.

31:21.361 --> 31:23.568
Welcome to the Marines, Kate.

31:24.156 --> 31:26.943
- Kate's gonna be your CO?
- That's the plan.

31:27.034 --> 31:30.237
I didn't realise Kate knew so much
about being a Marine.

31:30.328 --> 31:32.736
Kate doesn't know squat
about being in the Marines.

31:32.831 --> 31:34.290
She doesn't have to.

31:34.374 --> 31:37.044
I won't be interacting
with the recruits, Tony.

31:37.127 --> 31:39.796
I'll just be there to focus
on how they interact with Gibbs.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.872
One of them might be our sniper.

31:41.965 --> 31:44.883
You're not the only one around here
who knows how to profile.

31:44.968 --> 31:45.999
Maybe.

31:46.094 --> 31:49.510
But with that haircut,
you wouldn't pass for an ROTC student.

31:49.598 --> 31:53.216
The vest is gonna hardly even show
underneath this. Need your ribbons.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.635
What do we hear back from the FBI?

31:55.729 --> 31:58.765
Besides Agent Freeman's
extreme dislike for you?

32:01.234 --> 32:04.354
They'll cooperate,
but he's not too keen on the visible part.

32:04.446 --> 32:05.988
Our shooter isn't a moron.

32:06.073 --> 32:08.384
If he doesn't see police
and FBI presence in the neighbourhood,

32:08.408 --> 32:09.802
he's going to think something's wrong.

32:09.826 --> 32:11.596
Yeah, I have a problem
with that part too, boss.

32:11.620 --> 32:14.371
What's the point in setting a trap
if he knows about it?

32:16.249 --> 32:19.334
Part of a sniper's mission
is to infiltrate enemy territory.

32:19.419 --> 32:22.206
Our guy wants to prove himself,
validate his skills.

32:22.297 --> 32:24.503
He's not gonna pass up
an opportunity like this.

32:24.591 --> 32:27.164
- What if he succeeds?
- He won't.

32:32.307 --> 32:34.513
Don't take this the wrong way,

32:35.477 --> 32:37.220
but, you actually make that look good.

32:37.312 --> 32:38.475
Thanks.

32:38.772 --> 32:40.895
Have you tried yours on yet?

32:41.399 --> 32:44.484
- Try what?
- Gibbs said you'd be in uniform, too.

32:45.237 --> 32:46.435
He did?

32:50.200 --> 32:52.442
Gibbs gets Dress Blue Charlies,

32:52.828 --> 32:54.737
I look like one of the Village People.

32:56.248 --> 32:59.414
Maybe you can find a local cop
and get a dance routine going.

33:00.502 --> 33:01.581
How you doing?

33:01.670 --> 33:04.754
I'm hardwiring the main microphone
to the DSL line now.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.794
I already got the other two
on a wireless relay.

33:08.593 --> 33:09.969
There we go.

33:13.098 --> 33:15.470
You know, if this works, Abs,
you're a genius.

33:15.559 --> 33:18.892
Oh, Tony.
Tell me something I don't know.

33:18.979 --> 33:21.434
I once dated
my high school music teacher.

33:21.523 --> 33:23.848
Really? What was his name?

33:24.484 --> 33:25.563
Cute.

33:25.652 --> 33:29.068
Okay, all mikes are operational.
I'm set here.

33:29.406 --> 33:31.482
All right. I'm coming down now.

33:31.908 --> 33:33.984
You're a macho, macho man, Tony.

33:35.412 --> 33:37.321
The new window looks good.

33:38.081 --> 33:39.279
Yes, it does.

33:39.374 --> 33:42.161
How does it feel
to be back in uniform, Gunny?

33:42.294 --> 33:44.785
It's a little tighter than I remember.

33:46.089 --> 33:49.090
- So, you really think this will work?
- I don't know.

33:49.176 --> 33:51.927
If it doesn't, no sense worrying about it.

33:52.012 --> 33:53.969
Spoken like a true Marine.

33:56.099 --> 33:58.257
- Good morning, Captain.
- Major.

33:59.311 --> 34:00.473
Gibbs.

34:00.896 --> 34:02.888
- I mean, Gunny.
- Kate.

34:04.649 --> 34:06.309
Cover's off inside.

34:08.945 --> 34:10.652
You're looking good.

34:12.991 --> 34:14.449
These are out of order.

34:14.534 --> 34:16.094
I spent an hour trying to get it right.

34:16.161 --> 34:17.572
It's okay. A common newbie mistake.

34:17.661 --> 34:18.862
Maybe I should take her place.

34:18.955 --> 34:20.284
Your whole plan rests on

34:20.373 --> 34:22.580
this guy believing
that you're both Marines.

34:22.667 --> 34:25.502
We have it under control, Major.
She'll do fine.

34:25.587 --> 34:27.579
Well then, I'll just stay and help out.

34:27.672 --> 34:29.483
There's nothing wrong
with another set of eyeballs.

34:29.507 --> 34:30.706
Not a good idea.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.757
The best thing you can do
is leave this to us.

34:32.844 --> 34:34.552
I lost two of my men to this psycho.

34:34.638 --> 34:37.507
You really think I'm passing up
on a chance for payback?

34:39.184 --> 34:42.849
Major, your mission
is to protect our country.

34:43.855 --> 34:47.389
Our mission right now
is to protect you and your Marines.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.898
Allow us the honour of doing our job.

34:55.116 --> 34:57.275
Good luck, Gunnery Sergeant.

34:58.870 --> 35:00.115
Captain.

35:07.504 --> 35:08.915
Comm check.

35:11.424 --> 35:13.132
Loud and clear. Over.

35:13.218 --> 35:14.795
Hear you fine, Tony.

35:14.886 --> 35:15.965
Crystal.

35:16.054 --> 35:17.299
Comm's up, Gibbs.

35:19.849 --> 35:22.767
Now for the hard part. Waiting.

35:23.478 --> 35:26.039
You really think we're going to get
any potential recruits today?

35:26.106 --> 35:27.185
Yeah.

35:27.274 --> 35:29.515
A man was murdered here
three days ago.

35:29.609 --> 35:32.231
Who'd choose today
to decide to join up?

35:32.404 --> 35:33.684
A Marine.

35:35.532 --> 35:37.939
- Good point.
- Get ready to profile.

35:41.454 --> 35:42.949
Can I help you?

35:43.039 --> 35:45.447
What are you doing?
Giving away free Xboxes in there?

35:45.542 --> 35:47.084
That's the tenth kid this morning.

35:47.168 --> 35:50.372
He's really good at this.
I'm even thinking of signing up.

35:50.964 --> 35:52.541
What about potential snipers?

35:52.632 --> 35:55.467
- You'll be the first to know.
- No, Gibbs will.

35:55.552 --> 35:58.221
Just tell me he's still wearing his vest.

35:59.139 --> 36:02.638
- He said it was visible under his shirt.
- I knew it.

36:02.726 --> 36:06.640
If that sniper doesn't kill him, I will.
Of all the stupid, idiotic things.

36:06.730 --> 36:08.806
You realise we have an office
in Richmond.

36:08.898 --> 36:11.187
Why drive all the way down here
to see a recruiter?

36:11.276 --> 36:14.443
Well, I was watching the news,
I thought I'd check it out.

36:14.529 --> 36:16.154
The sniper doesn't scare you?

36:16.239 --> 36:19.442
Well, I figure he's shooting recruiters,
not recruits, right?

36:19.534 --> 36:22.985
So you'd drive all the way here
to see if I get shot or not?

36:23.163 --> 36:25.832
- If I could get a signature?
- No problem.

36:29.502 --> 36:30.961
See you later.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.040
Good luck to you.

36:34.924 --> 36:36.122
Thanks.

36:51.149 --> 36:53.722
Look, it's 4:30.
I think this guy's a no-show.

36:53.818 --> 36:55.977
The last two attacks
were between noon and 2:00.

36:56.071 --> 36:58.396
So I say we call it a day, Agent DiNozzo.

36:58.490 --> 36:59.569
Negative.

36:59.657 --> 37:01.816
Office isn't supposed to close
for another 30 minutes.

37:01.910 --> 37:04.317
If we close early, it'll look suspicious.

37:06.081 --> 37:07.491
What do you think, Kate?

37:07.582 --> 37:10.702
I think you have at least one more day
as a human target.

37:12.295 --> 37:15.249
Hello. Gunnery Sergeant Alvin Thomas.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.665
- How can I help you today, son?
- Yeah, I don't know.

37:17.759 --> 37:19.559
I've been thinking
about it a little, I guess.

37:19.594 --> 37:21.421
You got some pamphlets or something?

37:21.513 --> 37:22.758
Right here.

37:22.847 --> 37:25.682
The Marines offer a wide variety
of choices.

37:26.518 --> 37:28.925
What kind of things interest you?
Sit down.

37:31.314 --> 37:34.066
Not sitting around in an office like this.

37:34.150 --> 37:35.942
Can't say that I blame you.

37:36.027 --> 37:38.649
You interested
in something more active?

37:38.822 --> 37:39.901
Yeah.

37:40.490 --> 37:43.491
You seem like
a combat arms kind of guy to me.

37:44.828 --> 37:46.156
Artillery?

37:46.246 --> 37:47.823
Combat engineers?

37:49.040 --> 37:50.321
Infantry?

37:53.586 --> 37:55.081
Sniper teams?

37:57.340 --> 37:58.419
Yeah.

37:59.634 --> 38:03.169
I don't know.
Like I said, I'm not really sure.

38:03.763 --> 38:04.961
I just...

38:07.851 --> 38:09.843
Maybe I should come back.

38:11.354 --> 38:12.813
I'll be here.

38:22.699 --> 38:24.775
Tony, the kid who just left.

38:24.868 --> 38:28.034
6'4", blond hair, black jacket and jeans.

38:28.121 --> 38:30.576
Early 20s.
We think he might be our man.

38:48.850 --> 38:50.593
He was already here.

38:51.186 --> 38:52.846
Forget the kid, Tony!

38:52.937 --> 38:56.104
The sniper is the water delivery guy!
I repeat! The sniper...

39:10.747 --> 39:12.953
The mikes picked up the shot.

39:14.209 --> 39:16.118
I'm triangulating now.

39:16.961 --> 39:20.626
Got him! He's at the merchant building
on the corner of 6th and K.

39:20.715 --> 39:21.913
- Tenth floor.
- Right there.

39:22.008 --> 39:23.444
The building has an alley in the back.

39:23.468 --> 39:25.321
It's the most likely exit
from where he's positioned.

39:25.345 --> 39:26.459
On it.

39:27.096 --> 39:28.472
Go get him, Tony.

39:28.556 --> 39:30.216
We'll take the southern entrance.

39:41.361 --> 39:43.234
Federal Agent, drop the weapon!

39:43.321 --> 39:45.479
Drop it! Drop it!

39:47.575 --> 39:49.200
Drop the weapon!

39:52.914 --> 39:53.993
Hey!

40:01.923 --> 40:04.758
Thank you, Agent DiNozzo.
We'll take it from here.

40:04.842 --> 40:06.385
Hey, back me up.

40:09.222 --> 40:10.716
Secure the weapon.

40:22.527 --> 40:23.558
Hey.

40:24.487 --> 40:27.773
We got our guy.
FBI is taking the credit, of course.

40:29.867 --> 40:33.118
Kate, where's your cover?

40:34.122 --> 40:35.236
What?

40:39.752 --> 40:41.377
Kyle Hendricks, 22.

40:41.462 --> 40:44.463
Rejected by Sergeant
Gordon Mackenzie, 11 August, 2002,

40:44.549 --> 40:46.209
at the Rockville recruiting centre.

40:46.301 --> 40:48.922
He failed
the personality profile assessment.

40:49.012 --> 40:52.048
Sociopathic tendencies
with anti-social behaviour.

40:52.140 --> 40:54.263
His stated goal
for joining the Marine Corps,

40:54.350 --> 40:56.390
wanted to be a Marine sniper.

40:56.477 --> 41:00.522
Yeah, well, you got to admit,
he was one hell of a marksman.

41:01.357 --> 41:02.555
DiNozzo.

41:03.610 --> 41:04.808
Captain.

41:08.448 --> 41:10.571
So, what was it like?

41:10.658 --> 41:13.149
- What like?
- Being his superior officer.

41:14.287 --> 41:16.244
You mean, did I get
to boss him around?

41:16.331 --> 41:19.035
Make him salute me? Call me "ma'am"?

41:19.584 --> 41:21.826
- Basically.
- It was great.

41:22.879 --> 41:24.338
You're lying.

41:25.632 --> 41:26.746
Am I?

41:27.800 --> 41:31.169
You know, Abby said you looked
really good in your uniform, too.

41:31.262 --> 41:32.591
- Did she?
- Yeah.

41:32.680 --> 41:35.515
She said you'd fit right in
with the biker boy,

41:35.600 --> 41:40.476
and the Indian chief, the cowboy,
and all the other macho, macho men!
