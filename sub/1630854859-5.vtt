13:33.760 --> 13:35.510
Shuttle en route, Captain.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.740
Seven, I may have to ask you
for one more favor.

13:40.940 --> 13:43.250
Better do it while you can.

13:49.610 --> 13:51.390
[Shaw humming a tune]

13:58.400 --> 14:00.310
- Do you mind?
- Oh.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.720
Sorry.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.850
Just feeling chipper.

14:05.050 --> 14:08.420
Not because you're about to have
your asses handed to you.

14:08.620 --> 14:11.450
No. Just... chipper.

14:12.980 --> 14:16.120
You know, we have saved the
galaxy more than a few times.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.590
And hopefully they'll remember.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.820
Or they might remember that time

14:22.020 --> 14:24.170
that someone hot-dropped
the saucer section

14:24.370 --> 14:26.040
of the <i>Enterprise-D</i>on a planet.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.350
Or that time that someone

14:28.550 --> 14:30.480
threw the Prime Directive
out the window

14:30.680 --> 14:32.830
so they could snog
a villager on Ba'ku.

14:33.030 --> 14:36.440
Or the time that you boys
nearly wiped out all of humanity

14:36.640 --> 14:38.140
by creating a time paradox

14:38.340 --> 14:40.840
in the Devron system.

14:41.040 --> 14:44.530
Basically, when it comes
to rescues from danger...

14:45.530 --> 14:48.400
...you two have a real "chicken
and egg" thing happening.

14:49.710 --> 14:51.490
Those were the days.

15:05.770 --> 15:07.290
Ro Laren.

15:13.340 --> 15:14.920
Captain Shaw.
Permission to come aboard.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.820
Permission granted.

15:20.390 --> 15:22.580
Oh, hello. Where we going?

15:22.780 --> 15:24.450
Somewhere they can't find you.

15:24.650 --> 15:25.890
<i>RO:</i>
<i>Admiral Picard.</i>

15:26.090 --> 15:27.540
Captain Riker.

15:27.740 --> 15:29.670
Starfleet requests
that you submit to questioning.

15:29.870 --> 15:31.890
I should inform you
that anything you say

15:32.090 --> 15:33.410
can be used as evidence

15:33.610 --> 15:35.370
in case charges
are introduced against you.

15:35.570 --> 15:36.580
Charges of what?

15:37.580 --> 15:38.630
Treason.

15:52.770 --> 15:54.310
Is this really necessary?

15:54.500 --> 15:56.390
I'm perfectly capable
of handling all this myself.

15:56.590 --> 15:57.830
Your father asked me
to hide you.

15:58.030 --> 15:59.080
Put this on.

16:05.870 --> 16:08.320
No. No.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.760
- No, no, no. I can't do this.
- Just do it.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.150
If security officers
come looking,

16:12.350 --> 16:13.750
it's best to hide you
in plain sight.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.210
<i>BEVERLY:</i>
<i>For the record, the subject</i>

16:26.410 --> 16:28.510

16:28.710 --> 16:30.910
<i>a known threat</i>
<i>to the safety of the crew.</i>

16:31.110 --> 16:33.520
Ensign La Forge, can you
please verify for the recording

16:33.720 --> 16:36.290
that this corpse
is indeed not you?

16:38.120 --> 16:40.050
[gags, coughs]

16:40.250 --> 16:41.870
[retches]

16:43.040 --> 16:44.360
For the record,

16:44.550 --> 16:47.710
Ensign La Forge
has indicated yes.

16:47.910 --> 16:49.710
First, what we do know.

16:49.910 --> 16:50.970
Typically, upon death,

16:51.170 --> 16:53.360
Changelings revert
to liquid state.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.020
But somehow, this one

16:55.220 --> 16:58.060
has retained
its last replicated form.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.580
I'll start by examining
the epidermis.

17:11.590 --> 17:12.850
Curious.

17:16.510 --> 17:20.000
No DNA represented whatsoever.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.780
And yet there's
bloodlike plasma.

17:22.980 --> 17:24.610
This Changeling

17:24.810 --> 17:27.140
could pass
the traditional blood test.

17:27.340 --> 17:30.390
So, what does that mean?

17:34.090 --> 17:37.920
How the hell is Ro Laren
back in Starfleet?

17:39.360 --> 17:41.410
She should be in prison
for what she did.

17:41.610 --> 17:42.850
That was 30 years ago.

17:43.050 --> 17:44.720
The Maquis are no longer
an enemy.

17:44.920 --> 17:48.110
She had a mission to protect
the Federation from terrorists.

17:48.310 --> 17:49.770
Instead, she became one.

17:49.970 --> 17:52.290
- Jean-Luc...
- The last time you saw her,

17:52.490 --> 17:54.030
she pulled a phaser on you.

17:54.230 --> 17:55.640
Ro has always been an outsider.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.040
You're the one who sent her
to infiltrate the Maquis

17:58.240 --> 18:01.430
- knowing she might empathize.
- Empathy is one thing.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.700
Betraying a commanding officer
is another.

18:03.890 --> 18:08.210
And now she dares to show up
here and accuse us of treason?

18:09.690 --> 18:11.880
We have absolutely
no reason to believe

18:12.080 --> 18:14.050
that she will treat us justly.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.840
You mentored her.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.540
You trusted in her
when no one else would.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.540
You had a bond.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.440
And she broke it.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.450
Better let me do the talking.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.290
I've notified Captain Shaw

18:28.480 --> 18:30.590
that the <i>Titan</i>is under
official security review.

18:30.790 --> 18:32.770
We've begun the process
of transporting

18:32.970 --> 18:35.600
most of the ship's crew to
the <i>Intrepid</i>for reassignment.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.210
You will be questioned
separately.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.080
This tone...

18:40.280 --> 18:43.000
sounds to me as if our guilt
has already been predetermined.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.390
Well, your full cooperation can
bear weight on your sentence.

18:45.590 --> 18:48.350
Come on, Ro. You know us.

18:48.550 --> 18:51.790
For these proceedings, you will
address me as Commander.

18:51.990 --> 18:53.870
Commander?

18:55.910 --> 18:57.700
I'll start with Admiral Picard.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.920
Please escort Captain Riker out.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.580
[door whooshes shut]

19:12.320 --> 19:14.200
I'm curious,

19:14.400 --> 19:18.340
how does a lieutenant
who betrayed Starfleet

19:18.530 --> 19:20.730
and her commanding officer

19:20.930 --> 19:22.340
get reinstated?

19:22.540 --> 19:25.780
Did you or did you not
board the <i>Titan</i>

19:25.980 --> 19:28.350
under the guise of conducting
an official inspection

19:28.540 --> 19:30.000
in order to steal a shuttle?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.440
And how does a traitor
stand here

19:32.640 --> 19:34.830
posing as a commander
in Starfleet?

19:35.030 --> 19:36.000
Posing?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.960
As if I'm an impostor?

19:41.440 --> 19:44.440
Yes, Captain Shaw said you had
a Changeling issue on board.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.400
Let's just get this
out of the way, shall we?

19:55.010 --> 19:57.890
Blood or no blood, you...

19:58.840 --> 20:01.460
Your Bajoran earring.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.330
You're not wearing it.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.650
I thought it was
a symbol of your faith.

20:08.850 --> 20:10.780
Or is this you

20:10.980 --> 20:13.690
turning your back
on another institution?

20:13.890 --> 20:16.480
Save your animosity, Admiral.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.300
This isn't entirely about you.

20:20.130 --> 20:22.350
Let's talk about your son.

21:22.220 --> 21:23.900
to beam onto the <i>Intrepid</i>yet?

21:24.090 --> 21:25.850
What?

21:26.050 --> 21:27.680
Is...

21:27.880 --> 21:30.600

- Yes.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.950
No.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.380
Is there somewhere else
I can go?

21:34.580 --> 21:36.430
Anywhere, please.

21:36.630 --> 21:38.170
Another planet.

21:38.370 --> 21:41.300
Anywhere else as long as
it's not a Starfleet ship.

21:42.770 --> 21:43.950
No.

21:55.530 --> 21:57.620
Hey, you all right?

22:03.010 --> 22:04.670
[door whooshes open]

22:19.290 --> 22:21.250
Worf.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.310
I had a Vulcan master...

22:38.400 --> 22:42.020
...who taught me about
pride once.

22:42.220 --> 22:45.060
The natural evolution of pride

22:45.260 --> 22:47.330
is downfall.

22:47.530 --> 22:49.670
And here come you two.

22:50.890 --> 22:53.330
You killed Sneed

22:53.530 --> 22:55.030
right here, in public.

22:55.230 --> 22:57.720
And what did we learn?

22:58.720 --> 23:02.080
Pride leads us into traps.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.770
But patience...

23:04.860 --> 23:07.910
Patience brings great rewards.

23:08.110 --> 23:10.090
We seek information

23:10.290 --> 23:12.350
regarding your
criminal activity.

23:12.550 --> 23:15.220
You will yield your weapons.

23:15.420 --> 23:18.830
I assure you,
we have the upper hand.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.540
Were you under the impression

23:30.740 --> 23:33.720
I would not recognize
a mobile emitter?

23:33.920 --> 23:35.800
How disappointing.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.450
how the subject managed to avoid

Somehow, this Changeling's
been able to completely

replicate internal human organs.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.460
Only under intense dissection

24:13.660 --> 24:16.750
does the tissue
revert to its natural state...

24:17.890 --> 24:20.290
Is this a new species?

24:20.490 --> 24:21.850
No.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.850
It's evolution.

25:13.460 --> 25:14.780
Uh, if you'll excuse me,

25:14.980 --> 25:18.080
this is a private
and urgent medical issue.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.790
Everything all right, Admiral?

25:38.970 --> 25:42.540
Why are you so interested
in my son?

25:45.020 --> 25:47.800
Perhaps because you are avoiding
my questions about him.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.470
He's now central
to this investigation.

25:51.670 --> 25:52.950
Central?

25:53.150 --> 25:55.690
It's strange, though,
you haven't asked me

25:55.890 --> 25:58.170
about Vadic or the <i>Shrike.</i>

25:58.370 --> 25:59.170
The Ro I remember

25:59.370 --> 26:01.480
was much more thorough.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.650
Well, perhaps you didn't
know me at all.

26:03.850 --> 26:05.090
Then enlighten me.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.530
How did you claw your way

26:07.730 --> 26:10.010
back into Starfleet?

26:10.210 --> 26:11.700
[chuckles]

26:16.310 --> 26:19.190
After years with the Maquis,

26:19.390 --> 26:21.710
I turned myself in to Starfleet.

26:23.100 --> 26:26.550
I was court-martialed.
I was sent to prison again.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.810
But due to my history
with, uh, terrorist groups,

26:30.010 --> 26:33.060
I was recruited into
Starfleet Intelligence.

26:34.410 --> 26:37.980
They put me into an arduous
rehabilitation program.

26:39.070 --> 26:40.950
Where I proved myself.

26:41.150 --> 26:43.610
Worked my way up slowly, again.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.650
These are mere facts.

26:45.850 --> 26:47.350
That's not what I want to know.

26:47.550 --> 26:49.870
So, what is it you want to know?

26:50.070 --> 26:52.920
Why did you join the enemy?

26:53.120 --> 26:55.360
Why did you betray your honor?

28:42.760 --> 28:44.770
You do remember Guinan,
don't you?

28:44.970 --> 28:46.150
Put it down.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.340
- I will kill you.
- Tell me who you really are.

28:50.540 --> 28:51.730
You tell me.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.520
How do I know
you're not compromised?

28:53.720 --> 28:55.740
When you first came
on the <i>Enterprise,</i>

28:55.940 --> 28:57.740
your Bajoran earring violated

28:57.940 --> 28:59.220
the uniform dress code.

28:59.420 --> 29:00.740
We've been through all of this.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.140
Yes, but you claimed

29:02.340 --> 29:03.920
it represented
the family you'd lost.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.480
And I allowed it only to realize
it was for your ego.

29:12.570 --> 29:15.540
- Your Bajoran has improved.
- Oh, I have been

29:15.740 --> 29:18.940
rehearsing this conversation
for 30 years.

29:19.130 --> 29:20.890
[scoffs]

29:21.090 --> 29:22.720
You have no idea
what it was like

29:22.920 --> 29:24.510
living under your
relentless judgement.

29:24.710 --> 29:26.070
This wasn't about judgement.

29:26.270 --> 29:27.290
We had a bond

29:27.490 --> 29:29.210
based on mutual respect.

29:29.410 --> 29:31.690
Based on...

29:31.890 --> 29:33.040
You and I...

29:33.240 --> 29:34.990
- You and I what?
- You betrayed

29:35.190 --> 29:37.740
- everything I believed in.
- No.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.430
You wanted to mold me
in your image.

29:40.630 --> 29:43.960
Your mentorship. Your affection.
It was conditional.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.090
You dare to question my honor?

29:46.290 --> 29:48.400
I joined the Maquis
because belonging there

29:48.600 --> 29:49.970
meant standing up to injustice.

29:50.170 --> 29:51.490
Even if it meant betraying

29:51.690 --> 29:52.660
your beloved Starfleet.

29:52.860 --> 29:54.190
That was me.

29:54.390 --> 29:55.750
But you could never
understand that

29:55.950 --> 29:58.240
because you confuse morality
with duty.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.500
And that, Admiral,
is your dishonor.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.890
- I believed in you.
- Only when it was

30:03.090 --> 30:04.500
easy for you.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.240
If I meant so much,
you would have understood.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.540
You broke my heart.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.240
And you broke mine.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.360
Well...

30:32.560 --> 30:34.530
if that pain tells us anything,

30:34.730 --> 30:37.740
it's that we are
who we say we are.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.710
Why are you here, Ro?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.580
Starfleet is compromised.

30:52.020 --> 30:53.500
At the highest level.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.890
Jean-Luc, I need you
to tell me right now.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.290
Do you trust me?

31:09.380 --> 31:10.650
Yes.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.660
[grunting]

31:21.700 --> 31:23.890
Do you remember this place?

31:24.090 --> 31:25.530
I hope you do.

31:27.490 --> 31:30.320
It's where you took
poor Sneed's head.

31:32.150 --> 31:34.980
Not a kind fate for my brother.

31:35.180 --> 31:37.510
Unless I am mistaken,
you are Vulcan.

31:37.710 --> 31:40.860
Hence Sneed, a Ferengi,
is not your brother.

31:41.060 --> 31:43.080
Not by birth.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.260
But we grew up together.

31:45.450 --> 31:47.340
Scavengers of District Seven.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.900
We protected each other.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.220
Like family.

31:52.420 --> 31:53.610
Way to go.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.180
KRINN:
He was loyal.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.920
In my world, loyalty
is what passes for family.

31:59.120 --> 32:02.660
He and I had a blood oath,
and I see your bond.

32:02.860 --> 32:05.410
So you know what comes next.

32:05.610 --> 32:07.190
WORF:
Understand,

32:07.390 --> 32:09.190
we are with
Starfleet Intelligence.

32:09.390 --> 32:11.890
Sneed was responsible
for the death of hundreds of...

32:12.090 --> 32:14.850
KRINN:
Hundreds of
innocent people, yes.

32:15.050 --> 32:18.330
You learned that Sneed was
the Changeling's intermediary.

32:18.530 --> 32:22.470
You realized I facilitated the
break-in at Daystrom Station,

32:22.670 --> 32:25.730
and I'm sure
Starfleet Intelligence

32:25.930 --> 32:28.510
thanks you for your service.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.220
Never imagined a Vulcan
being dumb enough

32:32.410 --> 32:34.090
to become a gangster.

32:34.290 --> 32:37.180
There can be no utopia
without crime.

32:37.380 --> 32:40.780
Ergo, an organized
criminal enterprise is logical.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.880
Ye olde fight to the death?

32:53.710 --> 32:55.670
How original.

32:55.870 --> 32:58.240
Some of my associates
have wagered

32:58.440 --> 32:59.980
the Klingon, by nature,

33:00.180 --> 33:02.460
will kill the human
within 30 seconds.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.290
Others, the inverse.

33:05.490 --> 33:07.420
Let's settle the wager.

33:10.110 --> 33:12.770
60 seconds or you both die.

33:16.550 --> 33:18.730
Begin.

33:19.780 --> 33:23.050
An enemy's aggression
shows their weakness.

33:23.250 --> 33:25.830
We spoke of sacrifice earlier.

33:26.030 --> 33:30.130
Know that I have also sacrificed
much for this mission.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.580
And it is clear

33:33.780 --> 33:37.450
sacrifice is required again.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.630
Raffaela, house of Musiker...

33:46.670 --> 33:48.280
...it has been an honor.

33:55.250 --> 33:59.030
Klingons seldom disappoint.

34:07.690 --> 34:08.910
Worf.

34:10.130 --> 34:13.350
Do not hold back.
Because I cannot!

34:14.310 --> 34:16.350
[both grunting]

34:40.940 --> 34:42.080
Aah!

34:44.820 --> 34:47.040
I'm so sorry, Worf.

34:49.340 --> 34:50.870
Do not be.

34:51.820 --> 34:54.010
Today was a good day to die.

34:54.210 --> 34:55.910
[groaning]

34:56.870 --> 34:59.540
You are a warrior,

34:59.740 --> 35:00.880
and this...

35:01.830 --> 35:04.580
...is a worthy death.

35:06.580 --> 35:08.750
[grunts]

35:20.500 --> 35:22.990
[chittering]

35:23.190 --> 35:24.600
<i>RO:</i>
<i>I believe</i>

35:24.800 --> 35:26.130
the Changelings have infiltrated

35:26.330 --> 35:28.130
every sphere of power
at Starfleet,

35:28.330 --> 35:30.520
including key personnel.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.310
Ro, how is that possible?

35:33.510 --> 35:35.130
I don't know yet.

35:36.350 --> 35:38.580
I think that there are more
on the <i>Intrepid.</i>

35:38.770 --> 35:39.750
I don't trust anyone.

35:39.950 --> 35:41.140
Not the Captain.
I-I don't even

35:41.340 --> 35:43.190
trust the transporters
on the ship.

35:43.390 --> 35:46.840
There have been fleet-wide
issues in four months. I...

35:49.750 --> 35:52.490
What do you know about
the plans for Frontier Day?

35:53.540 --> 35:55.810
Oh, it's Starfleet's
anniversary.

35:56.010 --> 35:58.030
Pomp and circumstance.

35:58.230 --> 36:00.120
- I was supposed
to give a speech.
- Well, our

36:00.320 --> 36:02.950
entire fleet is on display.

36:03.150 --> 36:04.510
And what worries me

36:04.710 --> 36:06.210
is that security preparations
are classified.

36:06.410 --> 36:08.390
It's days away
and even I don't have access.

36:08.590 --> 36:10.560
But that's not evidence
of conspiracy.

36:10.760 --> 36:14.220
Jean-Luc, your ship
is not the only one

36:14.420 --> 36:16.000
with a Changeling problem.

36:16.200 --> 36:19.750
There have been 12 incidents
across multiple starships,

36:19.950 --> 36:21.440
all being kept quiet.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.190
I'm just connecting the dots.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.140
What does this
have to do with Jack?

36:29.790 --> 36:32.020
All I know is that Starfleet
insisted that I retrieve him.

36:32.220 --> 36:34.200
But it's not the first time
that I've heard his name

36:34.400 --> 36:35.890
amongst intelligence chatter.

36:36.090 --> 36:37.810
Plus, a few days ago,

36:38.010 --> 36:40.510
Changeling terrorists destroyed
a Starfleet recruitment center

36:40.710 --> 36:41.590
with a portal weapon.

36:41.790 --> 36:42.810
Does that sound familiar?

36:43.010 --> 36:43.990
The same used by Vadic.

36:44.190 --> 36:45.240
Mm.

36:46.420 --> 36:48.120
Let's take this
to Admiral Janeway

36:48.320 --> 36:50.560
- or Chancellor Roll.
- I've tried.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.650
Well, then let me.
I certainly have some sway.

36:53.850 --> 36:55.090
Well, if you can
get past their gatekeepers.

36:55.290 --> 36:56.350
I certainly couldn't.

36:56.550 --> 36:58.220
I even tried to open
an investigation

36:58.420 --> 36:59.960
but I was denied access
at every turn.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.040
I even went to the media.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.790
All I have are a pair
of intelligence assets

37:05.990 --> 37:07.190
on the ground that I trust,

37:07.390 --> 37:08.840
and we've been busy
gathering evidence

37:09.040 --> 37:10.970
connecting the portal weapon
to something else

37:11.170 --> 37:12.710
that the Changelings want.

37:12.910 --> 37:14.710
They're close.

37:14.910 --> 37:16.660
Even as we speak.

37:19.490 --> 37:21.580
KRINN:
Most unexpected.

37:22.630 --> 37:23.670
Check him.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.730
Fascinating.

37:34.930 --> 37:38.030
My calculations had the Klingon
prevailing, ten-to-one.

37:39.770 --> 37:42.740
That smell-- Klingon blood.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.180
Makes me sick.

37:45.380 --> 37:47.610
Get rid of him.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.710
You work for me now, Starfleet.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.970
You do have far more to lose.

38:04.060 --> 38:05.370
I know you have people here.

38:05.570 --> 38:09.250
An ex-husband, a son,

38:09.450 --> 38:10.380
granddaughter.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.690
You'll never own me.

38:12.890 --> 38:14.910
I'll kill you first.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.290
Would you care to wager on that?

38:19.550 --> 38:21.030
[male grunting]

38:26.860 --> 38:29.490
Klingons never disappoint.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.830
How you doing, big guy?

38:31.030 --> 38:32.270
I hope I didn't go too deep.

38:32.470 --> 38:35.530
I have lost a considerable
amount of blood.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.100
You were dead.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.450
I have mastered
the Kahless technique

38:39.650 --> 38:43.490
of regulating my heart rate
to nearly impercep... [grunts]

38:45.140 --> 38:47.110
Let us skip
to the interrogation.

38:47.310 --> 38:50.030
I am in desperate need
of medical attention.

38:50.230 --> 38:51.640
Talk now.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.730
Reason suggests

38:54.930 --> 38:56.560
that you won't kill me

38:56.760 --> 38:59.780
because you need
more information.

38:59.980 --> 39:02.300
My friend is bleeding
pretty badly.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.950
How much of his impatience
have you factored in there?

39:08.210 --> 39:09.830
Daystrom Station

39:10.030 --> 39:12.960
<i>is guarded</i>
<i>by a highly sophisticated</i>

39:13.160 --> 39:14.830

39:17.130 --> 39:19.670
<i>But it has flaws</i>
<i>that are most...</i>

39:19.870 --> 39:22.100

39:22.300 --> 39:23.150

39:26.130 --> 39:28.330
<i> Without it, no one can get in.</i>

39:28.530 --> 39:31.200
And you'll give us that device.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.930
That...

39:35.060 --> 39:37.240
...would be logical.

39:39.590 --> 39:43.120
I've transferred most of
the <i>Titan</i>crew to the <i>Intrepid.</i>

39:43.320 --> 39:45.300
I have left you
with a skeleton crew.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.610
You must make sure
that they are loyal.

39:47.810 --> 39:51.000
Jean-Luc, you need
to take the ship and run.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.470
Run?

39:53.820 --> 39:55.350
What about the <i>Intrepid?</i>

39:55.550 --> 39:57.880
I'm headed there now
to buy you some time.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.620
MALE:
Commander, we located you

39:59.820 --> 40:01.190
in the holodeck
but were unable to gain entry.

40:01.380 --> 40:02.670
Are you all right?

40:02.860 --> 40:04.880
Prepare the shuttle.
We're leaving. Excuse us.

40:10.450 --> 40:11.490
Ro...

40:15.100 --> 40:16.890
I wish, just once...

40:17.890 --> 40:19.380
...that you could
look into my heart

40:19.580 --> 40:23.080
and understand that I only did
what I thought was best.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.510
All these years

40:25.710 --> 40:27.690
that I wish you'd known me.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.210
And that I'd known you.

40:34.910 --> 40:36.520
Goodbye, Admiral.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.450
Commander, we were instructed
to return with Jack Crusher.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.440
We're leaving.
That's an order.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.430
Fastest court-martial
I've ever seen.

41:13.630 --> 41:15.740
Captain Shaw,
you must listen carefully.

41:15.940 --> 41:16.740
We must run.

41:16.940 --> 41:18.830
Run? From what?

41:19.030 --> 41:20.050
I don't have time to explain.

41:20.250 --> 41:21.440
But Starfleet is compromised

41:21.640 --> 41:23.090
and so is that ship.

41:23.290 --> 41:25.780
It's all so much worse
than we thought.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.360
Security.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.750
Belay that.

41:29.950 --> 41:31.100
Don't you dare.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.280
