In honor of Seymour's 20th year

we've decided to hold

- No, Miss Hoover. I'm Ralph.

- These are in honor of his army days.
- That explains the flags.

05:45.078 --> 05:48.138
Now, let's clear this up.
Who exactly are you?

05:48.247 --> 05:51.546
Sergeant Seymour Skinner,
U.S. Army.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.051
<i>It's true.</i>
<i>I was in his platoon.</i>

05:54.153 --> 05:57.316
But they said you were killed
on that scouting mission.

05:57.423 --> 06:00.984
No, just captured.
It's kind of a funny story, really.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.654
After five years
in a secret P.O.W. camp...

06:03.763 --> 06:05.993
I was sold to China
for slave labor.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.863
Since '77, I've been making
sneakers at gunpoint...

06:08.968 --> 06:10.868
in a sweatshop in Huhan.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.200
That's not a funny story.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.399
Well, I guess
you had to be there.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.238
Anyhow, the U.N. shut
the factory down last week...

06:18.344 --> 06:21.074
and the embassy shipped me home,
and here I am.

06:21.180 --> 06:25.116
So what's your story, Seymour,
if that is your real name?

06:25.218 --> 06:30.656
Well, obviously it isn't.
My real name is Armin Tamzarian.

06:30.757 --> 06:34.318
- [Gasping]
- [Laughing]

06:34.427 --> 06:37.328

to the judge and the old lady.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.516
I come from a town
called Springfield.

07:38.624 --> 07:42.355
And my dream is to go back and become
principal of the elementary school.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.694
Some people might call that
a pretty corny dream, uh, Sergeant.

07:46.799 --> 07:51.793
Well, there's nothing corny about
fresh-faced youngsters skipping to school...

07:51.904 --> 07:54.099
scraping knees
and spelling bees...

07:54.207 --> 07:58.007
and pies cooling softly
on the windowsill. [Chuckles]

07:58.110 --> 08:01.773

Well, that's about it.
And so, for the past 26 years...

10:00.433 --> 10:03.891
I've dedicated myself
to living out your dream.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.062
I didn't dream anything
about an aqua suit...

Look, lady, you obviously
have at least one son.

10:24.690 --> 10:29.024
No! I have one stranger

10:29.128 --> 10:32.529
- Take it easy, Mom.
- I said, back off!

10:32.632 --> 10:35.601
You better do as she says.

Hey, hey, hey.
Easy there, you big impostor.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.962

sign my original name?

11:17.043 --> 11:20.444
Just put an "X," then call yourself
whatever the hell you want.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.514
Well, now,
there's no need for profanity.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.846
My name may have changed, but I'm
still the same man I was last week.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.613
Not to us you're not.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.622
if you suddenly found out
Ned Flanders was an impostor?

11:31.724 --> 11:34.852
- Who's Ned Flanders?
- My next-door neighbor. Religious guy?

11:34.960 --> 11:38.327
- Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy.
- No, I don't!

11:38.431 --> 11:41.832

you're just a stranger...

11:41.934 --> 11:45.028
- pretending to be something he's not.
- Mmm.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.901
Oh, I'm sorry,
but that's just how I feel.

11:48.007 --> 11:53.070
No, don't apologize.
It's time I stopped pretending.

- Period.
- [Gasping, Murmuring]

12:12.598 --> 12:16.193

Sergeant Skinner's position...

12:16.302 --> 12:19.135

him to replace me.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.729
- Thank you.
- Well, now, I don't know.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.537
Skinner, do you know anything
about being a principal?

12:24.643 --> 12:26.975
Well, it's been
my lifelong ambition.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.775
And if a man pretending
to be me could do it...

12:29.882 --> 12:33.147
well, then, logically,
the real me must be far more qualified.

12:33.252 --> 12:37.450
- Good enough.
- Armin Tamzariars reign of terror is over.

12:37.556 --> 12:43.188
Now let us welcome our new Principal Skinner,
Principal Seymour Skinner.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.657
- Uh, him.
- [Cheering]

12:57.843 --> 13:00.869
Well, before I go,
I've got some personal items for you.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.847
You belong to
the Radio Shack Battery Club.

13:03.949 --> 13:08.147
Oh, 10 Canadian dollars. That's a souvenir
from your trip to Upstate New York.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.382
[Chuckles]
You've led quite a life, Tamzarian.

13:11.490 --> 13:15.722
It's your life.
I just kept it warm for you.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.763
Oh, I nearly forgot.
Your pocket watch.

13:18.864 --> 13:22.061
Mother's picture is still inside.
Take good care of her.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.762
I'll wind her every day.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.208
I poached some fish
for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.541
They're full of tiny bones,
so I want you to be careful.

13:34.647 --> 13:39.641
I will, Moth- uh, Mrs. Skinner.
[Sighs]

13:39.752 --> 13:41.720
Well, I'd better be going.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.090
[Sighs]

13:47.193 --> 13:50.629
<i>[Knocking]</i>

13:50.729 --> 13:54.392
Good evening, Edna. I know we were
planning to see a film tonight...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.400
but instead,
I'm leaving town forever.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.630
No, please.
I don't care what you've done.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.968
You're still a decent,
honorable man.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.974
Mmm.

14:04.076 --> 14:07.534
- That's the kind of talk that
makes me want to marry you.
- Oh!

14:07.646 --> 14:09.841
But instead,
I'm leaving town forever.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.883
- Good-bye.
- Mmm.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.965
Well, it's time to pick up
where I left off-

14:28.067 --> 14:30.228
as a no-good street punk.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.305
<i>[Engine Starts]</i>

14:38.143 --> 14:41.670
- Principal Skinner?
- Up yours, children.

14:44.550 --> 14:49.283
[Laughs] Now, to recap our top story
in its entirety.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.118
"The adaptable citizens of Springfield
have opened their hearts...

14:52.224 --> 14:55.318
to Principal Seymour Skinner,
who"-

14:55.427 --> 14:59.261
Not that one.
Idiots.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.356
[Cheering]

15:01.467 --> 15:05.494
Thank you. Thank you.
I must say, in many ways...

15:05.604 --> 15:08.471
Springfield really beats
the old slave-labor camp.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.873
[Cheering]

15:11.977 --> 15:14.377
I admit Sergeant Skinner
seems okay.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.278
But Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up
from the streets...

15:17.383 --> 15:19.647
and earned our respect
and admiration.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.687
- He lied about his name.
- His name doesn't matter.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.416
"A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

15:25.524 --> 15:28.254
- Not if you called 'em stench blossoms.
- Or crap weeds.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.329
I'd sure hate to get a dozen
crap weeds for Valentine's Day.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.399
- I'd rather have candy.
- Not if they were called scum drops.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.663
Your new principal
would like to say a few words.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.364
Remember, you have to
respect him.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.770
- He's a war hero.
- Ha-ha!

15:42.875 --> 15:44.775
Thank you, Chalmers.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.710
Where I come from,
there's no better way to get acquainted...

15:47.813 --> 15:50.839
than by reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance together.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.247
Why don't you lead us, son?

15:56.355 --> 15:59.916
Hey, America-
[Spoken Lyrics] America.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.925
- [Flatulent Sound]
- [Laughter]

16:02.027 --> 16:04.825
Well, that's very concise...

16:04.930 --> 16:07.865
but it's an insult
to everything I suffered for.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.492
Now, take a seat, junior,
and listen to someone...

16:10.602 --> 16:13.469
who gave their youth
in service of their country.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.632
Mrs. Krabappel,
the pledge, please.

16:16.742 --> 16:20.576
You haven't dealt with women
for a long time, have you, Sergeant?

16:20.679 --> 16:23.580
Are you asking me out?

16:23.682 --> 16:27.448
- [Siren Wailing]
- Ah, 433rd Street.

16:27.553 --> 16:31.045
My old neighborhood. Hmm.

16:33.592 --> 16:36.652
"Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.787
Capitol City's nakedest ladies.

16:38.897 --> 16:41.764
They're not even
wearing a smile.

16:41.867 --> 16:45.098
Nod suggestively.
Yes, six. Count 'em.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.866
Six gorgeous ladies
just dying...

16:47.973 --> 16:50.305
for your leers and catcalls.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.775
- Yowza, yowza."
- [Clock Chimes]

16:52.878 --> 16:56.712
[Groans] Seymour, it's 7:30.
Where were you?

16:56.815 --> 17:00.182
- A bar, Mom.
- I don't know what that is...

17:00.285 --> 17:03.482
but on Fridays, you come
straight home after school!

17:03.589 --> 17:05.819
Tonight is silhouette night.
Sit there.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.518
I really just came home
to change into a turtleneck.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.527
Seymour, sit!

17:10.628 --> 17:14.156
In the morning.
Oh, Mom, I'm borrowing your car.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.907
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Mmm.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.740
Mmm, how's your new son
working out?

17:27.846 --> 17:33.307
That child is the most disobedient,
smart-alecky, middle-aged man in creation!

17:33.419 --> 17:37.082
Hello, ladies. Is this the line for people
who wanna bad-mouth Sergeant Skinner?

17:37.189 --> 17:40.818
- And have 10 items or less.
- Twelve, 11, 10. The mars a weenie.

17:40.926 --> 17:44.623
Oh, now, be fair, Edna.
I liked Armin Tamzarian too...

17:44.730 --> 17:47.255
but he was at least as big a weenie
as Sergeant Skinner.

17:47.366 --> 17:50.995
- But he was our weenie.
- Now, there was a weenie...

17:51.103 --> 17:54.300
you could be proud
to call your son.

17:54.406 --> 17:58.172
- Did you ever tell him that?
- Hmm.

17:58.277 --> 18:02.475
Okay, once more,
where are we going?

18:02.581 --> 18:05.778
- To Capitol City.
- And why are you and the old lady in the car?

18:05.884 --> 18:08.580
We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian
into coming back.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.747
- And why is Marge here?
- I came up with the idea.

18:11.857 --> 18:14.519
- And why am I here?
- Because the streets of Capitol City...

18:14.626 --> 18:17.288
are no place for three
unescorted ladies.

18:17.396 --> 18:20.991
- And why are the kids here?
- Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.

18:21.100 --> 18:26.436
- And why is Grampa here?
- 'CauseJasper didn't wanna come by himself.

18:26.538 --> 18:30.235
- [Chuckles] Fair enough.
- Hello, beautiful!

18:30.342 --> 18:33.869
- In your dreams.
- We'll see about that.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.914
[Snoring]

18:38.650 --> 18:41.983
Hello, beautiful.
[Snoring Resumes]

18:44.389 --> 18:49.053
My mind is made up.
I'm not coming back, and that's final.

18:50.896 --> 18:53.524
- Oh, Seymour.
- And I'm not Seymour.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.930
My name is Armin.
This is Armirs apartment...

18:56.034 --> 19:00.027
Armirs liquor, Armirs copy of <i>Swank,</i>
Armirs frozen peas.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.801
- Can I see your copy of <i>Swank,</i> Armin?
- Yes, you can.

19:02.908 --> 19:06.708
This is Armirs life. Maybe it's not perfect,
but at least I'm back where I belong.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.440
I was born a no-goodnik,
and I'll die a no-goodnik.

19:09.548 --> 19:13.006
Seymour! I didn't bring you up
to use language like that!

19:13.118 --> 19:15.746
- You didn't bring me up at all.
- The hell I didn't!

19:15.854 --> 19:18.254
I've been taking care of you
for 26 years!

19:18.357 --> 19:21.383
- I'm the only mother you've ever known!
- But you have your real son.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.393
You're my real son!

19:23.495 --> 19:25.395
You've been my son longer
than he has.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.022
He doesn't need me,
and I don't need him!

19:28.133 --> 19:30.397
You march yourself downstairs
and get in that car!

19:30.502 --> 19:32.766
- Yes, Mother.
- And the rest of you too!

19:32.871 --> 19:35.533
[All]
Yes, Mrs. Skinner.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.610
[Honking Horn]

19:43.215 --> 19:46.673
Hey, everybody, look!
Armin Tamzariars back!

19:46.785 --> 19:50.050
- And he's gonna take over the school again!
- [Chattering]

19:50.155 --> 19:52.146
Now, hold on.

19:52.257 --> 19:56.318
Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character
who played us all for chumps.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.625
All right, all right.
So he's a fraud.

19:59.731 --> 20:04.794
I don't care. His mom doesn't care.
Do any of you care?

20:04.903 --> 20:07.235
- Nope, not me.
- I guess not.

20:07.339 --> 20:10.968
You all seem to be forgetting
that I am Seymour Skinner.

20:11.076 --> 20:12.976
This is where I belong.

20:13.078 --> 20:16.343
You can't ask me to disappear
because you like some other guy better.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.575
<i>I gave half my life</i>
<i>for you people.</i>

20:18.684 --> 20:21.209
Arert I entitled
to a little dignity?

20:22.721 --> 20:25.349
You're, uh-
You're right, Sergeant.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.652
Well, I don't see
any way out of this.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.353
Now, if you'll allow me,
I think I have a solution...

20:30.462 --> 20:36.401
that'll satisfy the town and let
Sergeant Skinner keep his dignity.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.935
- <i>[Train Horn Blowing]</i>
- But I'm a hero!

20:39.037 --> 20:43.064
- And we salute you for it. Now, don't come back.
- [Cheering]

20:43.175 --> 20:45.075
- I'm sorry, Seymour.
- <i>##[Marching Band]</i>

20:45.177 --> 20:49.910
It's nice you're alive, but you're just
not what I'm looking for in a son.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.813
I'm glad you understand.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.445
- [Cheering Continues]
- <i>##[Continues]</i>

20:56.555 --> 20:59.149
Well, this is
a lovely gesture, but...

20:59.258 --> 21:02.716
we still have to face the fact
that I'm not really Seymour Skinner.

21:02.828 --> 21:05.661
Oh, no, we don't.
Judge Snyder.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.755
By authority of
the city of Springfield...

21:07.866 --> 21:11.165
I hereby confer upon you
the name of Seymour Skinner...

21:11.270 --> 21:13.795
as well as his past,
present, future and mother.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.998
- Okay.
- And I further decree...

21:16.108 --> 21:18.133
that everything will be
just like it was...

21:18.243 --> 21:20.143
before all this happened.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.907
And no one will ever
mention it again...

21:23.015 --> 21:26.109
under penalty of torture.

21:26.218 --> 21:29.016
[Cheering]

21:29.121 --> 21:33.023
- Here, Son. This is yours again.
- Mmm.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.526
I've never been happier or
prouder to be Seymour Skinner...

21:36.628 --> 21:41.361
but these last few days as that hotheaded
rogue Armin Tamzarian...

21:41.466 --> 21:43.696
have taught me
a thing or two.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.329
You know, maybe I've been a
little too uptight in the past.

21:47.439 --> 21:51.273
Well, from now on, you're gonna see
a new Seymour Skinner.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.901
- Oh, no, we won't!
- Yes, Mother.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.459
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
