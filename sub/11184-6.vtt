00:00.968 --> 00:02.641
Dominic Santini, you're under arrest.

00:02.769 --> 00:03.839
Suspicion of murder.

00:03.904 --> 00:05.611
Next, on Airwolf.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.845
I knew you were holding back
on something from your past,

00:07.908 --> 00:09.410
but I figured you had your reasons.

00:09.476 --> 00:12.423
She used her daughter as bait
for men, and Dom knew it.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.356
He did kill her, I swear he did.

00:14.414 --> 00:15.654
I never touched her!

00:15.716 --> 00:17.593
I know that, Dom. You don't have to say it.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.130
The man needs an alibi.

00:19.186 --> 00:22.190
Absolutely no overt Firm involvement.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.564
What if he's convicted?

00:23.624 --> 00:26.036
You gotta get me out, String. Get me out.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.335
Get that thing! Get it!

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:35.162 --> 01:38.871
Midwest 509, you're clear
to taxi. Runway 23, over.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.935
I copy, tower.

01:41.234 --> 01:44.374
Be advised. We have gusts at 7 knots, 270.

01:44.571 --> 01:47.017
Roger, tower. East Julia to 7.

01:49.876 --> 01:54.382
Control, this is 509er, We're in
23 and awaiting clearance. Over.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.710
Hey, Dom?

02:26.179 --> 02:28.659
Dom? You here?

02:37.557 --> 02:39.400
Hey, Dom, what's the matter?

02:39.559 --> 02:42.870
Noth’n, It's noth’n.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.942
What did Archangel wanna see you about?

02:48.735 --> 02:51.181
Some mission up north. It'll wait.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.049
What's wrong?

02:55.942 --> 02:59.719
All these years I missed see’n her grow up.

03:03.316 --> 03:07.059
Now I'm even gonna miss
seeing her before they…

03:08.455 --> 03:10.492
Dom, I still don't understand.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.541
It was an overdose.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.503
- They found her on the beach.
- Who?

03:23.170 --> 03:26.310
My God, what a way for your kid to die.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.575
Kid?

03:32.112 --> 03:34.114
And the funeral is tomorrow.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.589
3,000 miles away.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.452
You'll make it in time.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.353
What about Archangel's assignment?

04:05.812 --> 04:09.919
We'll do the mission with a
slight detour to San Remo Island.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.096
I knew you were holding back
on something from your past,

04:22.162 --> 04:24.301
but I figured you had your reasons.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.340
Sally was 7 when my wife took her away.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.347
They just fell off the face of the Earth.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.658
What about Archangel’s mission?

04:50.223 --> 04:51.827
We'll make it in time.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.931
It's paradise.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.874
I suppose I should have some kind of feel’n

04:59.933 --> 05:04.006
for the place I was born, but I don't.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.910
If Archangel ever finds out

05:07.974 --> 05:10.284
that you're sticking your
neck out for me, String,

05:10.343 --> 05:11.981
instead of do’n that mission,

05:12.045 --> 05:14.753
all hell will break loose. You know that.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.817
But I appreciate it, buddy.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.602
And when we're completely finished,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.305
move over, Monte Carlo.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.709
Ladies and gentlemen, a special preview

05:38.772 --> 05:41.309
and a very private party.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.354
Oh, it's gorgeous! Here,
ladies. Help yourselves.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.321
Come on, take some.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.689
Beautiful, Jason. Thank you.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.691
Class, elegance, taste.

05:52.552 --> 05:55.533
I've always said it, you have it.

05:55.589 --> 05:59.332
And it's all ours, Congressman. All ours.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.538
Here we go, one more time now.
Come on now, baby. Here we go.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.303
All right! All right!

06:05.699 --> 06:09.044
I hope you tell your friends
about our beautiful set-up.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.912
No cameras, no watchdog committees…

06:11.972 --> 06:14.145
It's a sanctuary.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.724
Aaron!

06:25.452 --> 06:26.829
Aaron!

06:29.656 --> 06:31.602
Dominic.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.503
Dominic.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.039
Aaron.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.580
Aaron, this is Stringfellow Hawke.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.085
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.946
- Dom, I'm really sorry.
- I know.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.755
Thanks for the call.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.622
You gonna be able to keep things under control?

06:57.817 --> 07:00.764
Don't worry about me. I'm older now.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.165
Dom and I grew up on these beaches.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.640
If it hadn't been for him getting the air bug,

07:10.697 --> 07:13.234
he'd still be chasing bluefin and marlin.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.080
It wasn't flying that took
me off these islands.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.138
I know that, Dom.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.248
How are your grandchildren, Aaron?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.651
Sent 'em to the mainland.

07:22.709 --> 07:26.213
No good for kids around
here anymore. Not like it was.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.485
What is?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.738
Hey, Dom. You gonna be all right?

07:45.098 --> 07:46.839
I'll be fine.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.943
Dom's parents were married in this chapel.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.715
Dom was christened here, so was Sally.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.980
I would like to begin by saying a few words

09:02.042 --> 09:05.216
about the tragic passing of
this dearly beloved daughter

09:05.278 --> 09:07.451
of Lylah and Dominic Santini.

09:07.614 --> 09:10.652
Dominic, Lylah, little Sally Anne.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.891
Only our Lord can know
for certain the heartaches,

09:13.987 --> 09:16.126
the all too human trials…

09:16.189 --> 09:17.395
It's a joke.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.470
…that brought her to this tragic pass.

09:19.526 --> 09:20.834
Hypocrites.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.238
- Bloodsuckers.
- Lylah, honey...

09:23.997 --> 09:26.238
What are you doing here?

09:26.966 --> 09:30.072
You never wanted to know us
when she was still alive.

09:31.738 --> 09:35.709
Money. That's all anybody thinks
about in this stinking hole.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.379
Lylah, this is not the place.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.253
What are you doing here?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.292
She was my daughter, too.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.251
She hated your guts just like I do.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.258
Don't say that. Don't say anymore.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.233
Hell, you can't even be sure she was your kid.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.894
I wasn't.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.936
Dom, Dom! Dom!

10:01.701 --> 10:03.840
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.008
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.950
Aaron, I got to know.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.117
Did my daughter hate me?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.848
- The child was confused.
- Answer me!

10:14.814 --> 10:16.316
She loved you, Dom.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.293
Let us remember the happy times…

10:18.351 --> 10:21.491
Sure. 'Cause I was so good to her.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.294
'Cause I was always there when she needed me.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.795
For it leaves behind the
bitterness and poignancy

10:27.861 --> 10:29.738
of lives left unfinished…

10:30.163 --> 10:32.837
When we were kids there was noth’n
out there but islands, schooners,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.741
and fat-bellied sponge fishermen.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.337
Now they crowd people in like fleas on a dog.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.974
I'll take the old days, remember, Dom?

10:41.040 --> 10:44.954
Just around that point where we
used to take those mainland girls?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.690
Are you telling me that Dom was a skirt-chaser?

10:48.748 --> 10:51.228
Oh hey, ladies' man in those days.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.691
I'll be right back.

10:53.753 --> 10:56.290
- You want me to go with you?
- No!

10:58.758 --> 11:00.669
I won't be long.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.774
Guys like Dom never change.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.408
He's still touchy.

11:10.436 --> 11:14.384
Is that the famous casino of yours?

11:14.474 --> 11:17.318
Yeah, it's been closed for 3 months, expanding.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.786
You know, more tourists, more bucks.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.953
Economics of scale.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.758
Economics of bunk.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.025
Me and my husband had a nice little place.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.693
Then they decided they
needed a new parking lot.

11:30.757 --> 11:34.466
We didn't want to sell, but they
offered us 180 for our 2-bedroom.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.875
- Doesn't sound too bad.
- Yeah, that's what we thought.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.706
Then we found out the only
other housing we could get

11:39.766 --> 11:42.007
was one of their condos, 250.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.911
I'm living in a trailer.

12:09.195 --> 12:12.199
I came for the locket.
That's all I want from you.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.469
Who knows where it is.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.480
Hell, it isn't worth $5.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.078
I gave her that locket, she
loved it, I want it back.

12:24.310 --> 12:27.086
My God, look at you.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.552
A 2-bit mechanic.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.328
Why couldn't she have been more like me?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.994
She'd be what you are now.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.735
She would've had the strength to survive.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.869
The locket, I want it.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.500
Dom, wait.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.772
Of all the mistakes I've made in my life,

13:21.834 --> 13:24.610
you're the only one I truly regret.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.244
I'm sorry too, Lylah.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.683
Men, you always fall for it, don't you?

13:46.926 --> 13:48.269
I'm not going to go into

13:48.328 --> 13:50.604
where you guys have been or why.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.673
I thought you were taking care of business.

13:53.733 --> 13:57.909
Specifically, overflight of a
certain ice station 1,000 K's

13:57.970 --> 13:59.779
north of the Arctic Circle.

14:00.139 --> 14:03.279
Infrareds and micro-scans, if you please.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.651
I've got it.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.123
Coordinates should be coming through now.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.053
He said we got it.

14:09.115 --> 14:12.528
Let's not be flip.
That's inside Soviet airspace.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.155
We won't tell if you don't.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.699
No hitches, guys,

14:15.755 --> 14:20.636
and maybe we'll overlook this
recent unauthorized jaunt of yours.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.200
Any problems?

14:22.261 --> 14:25.470
Yeah, where are my mukluks? I'm numb already.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.884
Do you need much more?

15:07.940 --> 15:10.477
We're past it. We got everything he asked for.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.883
Good. I'm drained.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.350
Let's head back before anybody
decides to send up a greeting.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.434
String, Mr. Santini…

15:32.865 --> 15:34.845
wait, I gotta talk to you quick.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.438
- Did you miss us?
- Oh, knock it off, you two.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.276
Well, I guess you didn't miss us.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.944
- We're not good enough for you?
- Would you stop it?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.285
The police are here, Lieutenant Grodin.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.649
Okay, Grodin, you got us cold.

15:48.714 --> 15:51.354
Hand over the parking warrants
and let us hit the rack.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.328
Hi fellas, this is serious.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.994
Dominic, what were your precise
whereabouts last night

15:57.056 --> 15:59.764
between 9:00 pm and 6:00 am this morning?

16:00.493 --> 16:02.871
Well, that's easy, I was…

16:03.529 --> 16:04.872
at…

16:05.198 --> 16:06.939
He was at the North Pole.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.613
You know this woman, Dominic?

16:14.707 --> 16:17.017
Sure I know her, why?

16:17.777 --> 16:19.814
Dominic Santini, you're under arrest.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.586
You're out of your mind, Grodin.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.887
What charge?

16:22.949 --> 16:24.326
Suspicion of murder.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.056
The victim's name was Lylah Morgan,

16:26.118 --> 16:28.359
formerly known as Mrs. Dominic Santini.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.800
- Lylah?
- She was beaten to death last night, Dominic.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.430
Mr. Santini, it's my duty to inform you

16:34.494 --> 16:36.474
that you have a right to remain silent.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.304
If you give up that right to remain silent,

16:38.364 --> 16:41.504
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.485
Turn sideways, face the wall.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.559
Step over here.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.095
You okay?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.330
Any reason I shouldn't be?

17:08.394 --> 17:09.805
You need anything?

17:10.930 --> 17:14.069
Yeah, the key.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.744
Here, use this. Come with me.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.851
Right through here. Remove your clothes.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.328
That bad?

17:40.693 --> 17:41.933
What do you want me to say?

17:41.994 --> 17:43.632
Say we can take him home.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.198
It's out of my hands.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.470
Now, come on.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.445
If he was the cop and you
were in there, he'd help you.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.379
How long before they're gonna send me back?

17:51.437 --> 17:53.417
You know, you're some friend.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.052
All he is to you is a poker hand, that's all.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.452
Well, if he fights extradition
it could take years.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.991
Some guy across from the table
on Thursday nights, right?

18:01.047 --> 18:02.958
- What about bail?
- Probably not.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.962
- A face behind a handful of dollars.
- Caitlin!

18:06.118 --> 18:07.358
What if he…

18:07.420 --> 18:09.525
That's all Mr. Santini is
to him, you know that.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.863
Caitlin!

18:12.224 --> 18:14.170
What if he waives extradition?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.033
Maybe 2 weeks.

18:19.498 --> 18:20.772
Let's go.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.143
- You keep an eye on him.
- I will.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.713
Can I bring him some magazines
and stuff like that?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.155
No problem.

18:35.514 --> 18:36.925
Thanks.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.634
The man needs an alibi.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.469
He has the most perfect one in the world.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.842
He was 2,000 miles away from here

18:52.898 --> 18:55.469
working for Uncle Sam. Airwolf's his alibi!

18:56.636 --> 18:59.082
You know and I know he can't use that.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.675
- Well fine, give him another one.
- I can't.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.449
Well then, pull a couple of
phony witnesses out of a hat.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.012
Say that you were having
dinner with him at the time.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.216
I don't care, whatever.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.156
I told you when I brought it upstairs,

19:09.215 --> 19:12.992
they said, "Absolutely
no overt Firm involvement."

19:13.252 --> 19:15.698
Yeah well, they won't turn their back on Dom.

19:15.755 --> 19:16.927
The hell if they will!

19:16.989 --> 19:20.732
I'm not gonna turn my back
on Dom! Just bear with me.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.238
It's not good enough, Michael.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.638
I said no overt involvement.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.707
Now, behind the scenes, I'll
see if I can get to the Judge

19:27.767 --> 19:31.715
or find a way that the DA can refuse
to indict him on a technicality.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.512
Maybe I got… look…

19:33.572 --> 19:35.677
just leave it to me, I'll handle it.

19:35.741 --> 19:39.052
Yeah, and the bottom line
is that you guarantee noth’n.

19:39.111 --> 19:43.560
Don't jump all over me. I'm
asking you to give me some time.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.718
How long?

19:45.985 --> 19:49.194
A few weeks, maybe a month, 2 at most.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.199
What if he's convicted?

20:00.299 --> 20:02.404
You know, I might take Airwolf

20:02.468 --> 20:05.039
and I'm gonna land right
on top of that City Hall,

20:05.104 --> 20:08.381
and I'm gonna put up a fireworks
show that they'll never forget.

20:08.441 --> 20:12.583
And then you'd lose Airwolf and
you still won't have Dominic out!

20:26.726 --> 20:27.966
Not a clue.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.871
I hadn't seen the woman in
years. You know that, String.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.534
Why did you leave us?

20:33.132 --> 20:35.043
I went up to her place.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.870
For what, a nightcap?

20:38.571 --> 20:41.711
I went up there for something
of my daughter's, a locket.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.443
What are you doing? Grilling me?

20:45.878 --> 20:49.883
I never touched her! I couldn't
have! No matter what!

20:49.949 --> 20:52.862
Damn it, I know that, Dom.
You don't have to say it.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.197
You know, String, I…

21:00.326 --> 21:03.500
I keep think’n about that
North Korean prison camp

21:03.562 --> 21:05.803
when I went down behind Chinese lines.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.369
They kept us in holes in the ground, String.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.280
And it was 40 below, 40 below, String.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.980
Dom, compared to that this is a piece of cake.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.480
- You gotta get me out, String.
- Come on, buddy.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.684
Get me out.

21:26.519 --> 21:27.691
I will.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.296
I sure will.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.004
Don't move. Just stand still.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.304
- Just stand still.
- Officer…

23:24.470 --> 23:26.177
Don't give me no problems.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.476
I was looking for you.

23:28.540 --> 23:29.848
Who the hell are you?

23:29.909 --> 23:32.788
And what are you doing
breaking into a crime scene?

23:33.479 --> 23:36.983
My name is Stringfellow Hawke. I'm
a friend of Dominic Santini's.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.431
As far as we're concerned, Mr.
Hawke, we've got our man.

23:48.494 --> 23:52.670
Physical evidence, witness that
placed him at the scene of the crime,

23:52.731 --> 23:55.575
even a prior attempted
assault against the victim.

23:56.201 --> 23:58.340
Dominic Santini's no killer.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.180
Look, not many are, Mr. Hawke.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.242
We yell and curse and threaten each other

24:03.309 --> 24:04.754
and then get into bed together.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.689
Until one time too many.
One word too much and…

24:08.347 --> 24:10.486
He hasn't even seen her in years.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.928
Everything's been over between them for
so long, why would he kill her now?

24:13.986 --> 24:16.057
Well, his daughter was alive till now.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.831
An awful lot of upset people at that funeral.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.270
I don't know what you're
trying to sell, Mr. Hawke.

24:22.328 --> 24:25.070
But the lady was a slut for the asking.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.578
Look, I know he didn't try to see it that way.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.412
Even that worked against him.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.948
Maybe he faced up to it
just before he killed her.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.351
How close was she with Vince?

24:39.745 --> 24:41.418
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

24:41.547 --> 24:44.721
If they don't break the law,
I don't make 'em my business.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.292
See, a different kind of element's
been com’n over to the island

24:48.354 --> 24:50.595
since the casino went up.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.860
It's the price we pay.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.063
For what?

24:54.426 --> 24:58.636
Growth. Prosperity. A better way of life.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.811
It sure wasn't better for
Sally Anne Santini or Lylah.

25:10.909 --> 25:12.718
Okay Mrs. Molinowski, now remember,

25:12.778 --> 25:14.917
the important thing is the elevation.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.765
Well, I think that's enough
for today, don't you?

25:27.826 --> 25:29.828
See you tomorrow, same time.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.339
Your game looks great, by the way.
It's really coming along.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.438
Mrs. Sinclair, your court is ready.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.847
Sinclair party, court's ready…

25:43.509 --> 25:45.546
You think I can buy you something cold?

25:45.611 --> 25:47.613
Why not? I've earned it.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.651
The regular, Bob.

25:51.016 --> 25:54.987
You probably could use a
little work on your serve,

25:55.054 --> 25:57.432
but your basic style's pretty good.

25:57.489 --> 25:58.797
This beer free?

25:59.591 --> 26:01.696
I'm just try’n to make talk.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.331
Just try’n to make a liv’n.
It doesn't get easier.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.774
Sometimes it's just kinda how the cards fall.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.106
Don't tell me.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.773
3 weeks ago I was all set to buy this place.

26:10.836 --> 26:13.112
This particular lady's cash, and my contacts…

26:13.172 --> 26:15.482
all of the sudden, down the tubes.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.815
What happened?

26:17.142 --> 26:18.678
She cut me out.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.392
So why did Lylah cut you out?

26:25.150 --> 26:26.686
Who said Lylah?

26:27.653 --> 26:29.394
Say, I know where it was.

26:32.357 --> 26:34.268
Sally Anne's funeral.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.034
You were with Lylah's ex, that guy Santini.

26:38.897 --> 26:41.434
You're try’n to pin this on me, aren't you!

26:45.471 --> 26:46.950
Did I look bad?

26:50.542 --> 26:53.113
I don't think anybody even noticed.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.291
Nobody saw? You sure?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.616
I have my reputation to protect.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.622
So, what was Lylah like?

27:02.721 --> 27:05.099
The broad was loaded. She had more
cash than she knew what to do with.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.159
She gave me plenty when she had it.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.671
And I'll say that for her, too,

27:08.727 --> 27:11.435
even after our business
arrangements fell apart.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.372
Why would I kill the goose
that lays the golden egg?

27:14.433 --> 27:16.379
Tell me, why would I do that?

27:16.535 --> 27:18.446
What do I look like, some
kind of an idiot or what?

27:18.504 --> 27:20.245
Why would you even say you didn't kill her?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.545
Because I didn't.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.553
Nobody asked you either.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.788
Dominic bought this place on the GI Bill.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.691
He and Lylah moved in before Sally was born.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.423
They had some happy times here, too.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.294
We all did.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.132
Well, here we go.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.216
Why did Dom keep this house all these years?

27:54.273 --> 27:55.718
He never came back.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.616
Well, he thought maybe one
day Sally'd come home.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.414
And if she did, it'd be here waiting.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.151
I thought you said she did live here.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.322
Only for the last few weeks, before she died.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.160
She was in with that casino crowd, Hawke.

28:10.255 --> 28:14.169
In our day, we didn't even
know slime like that existed.

28:30.609 --> 28:33.783
This film must be every bit of 20 years old.

28:37.683 --> 28:40.220
That Lylah was a showstopper in those days,

28:40.285 --> 28:41.764
no need denying it.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.773
Hey, can you back it up?

28:56.134 --> 28:58.910
Right there, that lady. Was she at the funeral?

28:58.971 --> 29:02.316
Beatrice Moretti, that's Lylah's oldest friend.

29:02.574 --> 29:06.420
If Lylah trusted anyone on this
island, it would be Beatrice.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.686
You know, Hawke,

29:13.452 --> 29:17.332
for what Lylah did to that
child, he did kill her,

29:17.656 --> 29:19.135
I swear he did.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.400
What are you saying, Aaron?

29:21.526 --> 29:25.599
When Lylah was over the hill, she
used her daughter as bait for men,

29:26.798 --> 29:28.607
and Dom knew it.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.957
What do you suppose he was after?

30:19.318 --> 30:21.025
There's nothing here.

30:33.432 --> 30:34.911
All right, ladies.

30:34.966 --> 30:37.446
It's legal to admire, Mr. Hawke,

30:37.502 --> 30:39.982
so long as you don't disturb the artistry.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.409
This is our spring line.

30:42.874 --> 30:46.185
And then, once in a while, even perfection

30:46.278 --> 30:50.226
can use a little helping hand.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.091
- There you go.
- Thank you, Bea.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.629
Don't mention it.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.500
Lylah was an attention-getter
right up to the end.

30:57.723 --> 31:00.033
She really knew how to handle men.

31:00.125 --> 31:03.402
Rough 'em up a little bit,
she used to say, they love it.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.733
But Lylah was getting desperate

31:07.799 --> 31:10.609
and maybe she did push Sally Anne

31:10.669 --> 31:13.548
at the men she needed a little.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.174
So, what did the girl think of it?

31:15.240 --> 31:16.981
Careful, Beatrice.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.150
Sorry, dear.

31:20.045 --> 31:23.254
Lylah and I were like sisters.

31:23.515 --> 31:27.930
And I am not going to start to throw
stones now that she is dead

31:29.154 --> 31:30.531
and in her grave.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.865
What's wrong with you, Bea?

31:32.924 --> 31:35.336
You're too skinny to see.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.233
You know, you were in half
the photos at the old house.

31:43.468 --> 31:44.469
Listen.

31:46.204 --> 31:49.344
Dominic could have had any girl he wanted.

31:49.674 --> 31:52.621
Rich families came to the island on holiday,

31:52.878 --> 31:56.052
and oh, he had a way.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.923
Oh, Lylah was exciting.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.927
But Dominic never really loved her.

32:03.989 --> 32:07.027
She told him she was pregnant.
She wasn't pregnant.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.902
Sally Anne wasn't born until years later.

32:10.028 --> 32:13.498
Sounds like the lady sure
hurt an awful lot of people.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.037
Used is the correct word.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.911
People around here are
getting very good at that.

32:22.841 --> 32:26.584
Mr. Hawke, Mr. Darius would like to see you.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.986
And he's one of the best.

32:34.753 --> 32:38.860
I'm sorry about your friend.
Let's hope justice is done.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.135
In the meantime, what are
you doing here, Mr. Hawke?

32:42.194 --> 32:43.969
Looking for answers.

32:44.429 --> 32:46.033
I've heard you're stirring things up.

32:46.097 --> 32:48.907
There have been some complaints.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.105
Complaints?

32:50.902 --> 32:52.882
You're pretty important around here.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.611
People come to you with complaints?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.346
I have a big stake in this island,

32:56.408 --> 32:58.911
it's no secret people come to me.

33:00.178 --> 33:01.851
Yeah, like Lylah?

33:04.516 --> 33:07.963
If Lylah had troubles, you know
I'd like to know what they were.

33:11.156 --> 33:15.400
Lylah had only one trouble,
Mr. Hawke, no money.

33:15.827 --> 33:19.969
And around here people need
money or they get pushed aside.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.111
She had enough to keep Vince.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.737
You must be kidding.

33:24.369 --> 33:26.610
If I didn't buy him his tennis rackets,

33:26.671 --> 33:29.083
he'd have to hit the balls with his head.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.247
Lylah kept him? That's a laugh.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.487
They were 2 losers in search of a handout.

33:37.048 --> 33:38.891
Yeah, losers maybe.

33:38.950 --> 33:42.124
But you had quite a thing

33:42.187 --> 33:44.224
with Lylah for a long time.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.627
That's ancient history.

33:48.393 --> 33:50.805
Go home, Mr. Hawke.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.572
So, how long did this go on
between her and Darius?

33:59.771 --> 34:02.980
Not long, Lylah got rid of men very fast.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.146
Why didn't you tell me?

34:06.011 --> 34:09.083
If you started hitting on him, I
was afraid of what might happen.

34:09.147 --> 34:10.319
What? To me?

34:12.284 --> 34:13.695
To me.

34:14.452 --> 34:16.762
I live on this island. I've seen things happen.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.322
Boat goes down with all hands.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.632
A car misses the curb,
piles up below the jetty.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.599
You see how it is?

34:46.851 --> 34:50.492
You look great, Mr. Santini,
really, really great.

34:50.554 --> 34:52.295
I know how I look.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.498
I know how I feel.

34:54.993 --> 34:56.630
What's the word from String?

34:56.695 --> 35:00.006
Oh, he wanted me to tell you that
everything's gonna be fine.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.441
He got noth’n.

35:08.740 --> 35:12.153
Mr. Santini, can I bring you something?

35:12.210 --> 35:14.588
Books, chocolates, anything.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.354
You could bring me a chopper.

35:16.414 --> 35:19.190
Set it down in the jail yard in 10 minutes.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.263
I'll be there, I guarantee it.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.698
What am I doing here?

35:31.363 --> 35:33.570
Mr. Santini, we're gonna get you out.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.472
I'm not a criminal, Cate.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.706
I know that, Mr. Santini.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.214
Look at me.

35:39.704 --> 35:42.947
I never hurt a soul in my life.

35:45.176 --> 35:46.985
Where do they think I'll go?

35:48.313 --> 35:50.884
Murderers, they let walk.

35:51.616 --> 35:54.096
Me, they keep in a cage!

36:15.140 --> 36:16.483
Hey, Vince!

36:18.943 --> 36:20.684
Excuse me, ladies.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.495
- You're on Darius' payroll.
- Who isn't?

36:33.558 --> 36:34.593
I'm not.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.196
Well, you don't live here.
You don't breathe his air.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.572
You also lied to me about Lylah's money.

36:39.631 --> 36:40.666
Hey, no way!

36:40.732 --> 36:43.212
She told me she was about to make a
big score and she'd take me along.

36:43.268 --> 36:44.372
And you believed her?

36:44.436 --> 36:46.040
No, I didn't trust her.

36:46.104 --> 36:48.983
But I went with it, just in case. Wouldn't you?

36:54.946 --> 36:56.755
They know you're broke?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.559
There was one more thing.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.733
She said if anybody ever tried to do her in…

37:03.788 --> 37:07.361
…her baby would protect her. What
do you suppose she meant by that?

37:07.425 --> 37:09.871
I'm not sure, but I got an
idea. Meet me at the cottage.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.272
Why? I'll explain it when you get here.

37:13.465 --> 37:14.944
Just get here.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.782
Sally Anne, if anything should happen to me…

37:27.846 --> 37:29.052
That's her.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.287
…take the contents of this parcel
to your Father, Dominic Santini.

37:31.349 --> 37:34.887
It will prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt the identity of my murderer.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.455
Jason Darius.

37:36.521 --> 37:40.128
He skimmed casino money, I
blackmailed him. Why not?

38:14.592 --> 38:16.902
Hey, come back. What are you doing?

39:11.916 --> 39:14.362
Have a nice swim, Hawke.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.878
He's gone. Let's go.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.501
You were lucky.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.095
Go home, Mr. Hawke.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.111
Darius killed Lylah.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.745
Go home, Mr. Hawke.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.049
She was blackmailing him.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.382
Can you prove it?

40:14.712 --> 40:16.419
He was skimming from the casino.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.358
He was afraid she'd go to the feds.

40:18.416 --> 40:22.762
Mr. Hawke, stay alive to
visit your friend in jail.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.728
He owns you too, huh?

40:27.558 --> 40:30.698
I'm a good cop, mostly.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.772
I keep things pretty straight
for these people here.

40:34.832 --> 40:37.369
Most of that casino never touches us.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.239
Lie to yourself.

40:39.304 --> 40:40.783
Well, what do you want from me?

40:40.838 --> 40:42.545
They have all the power!

40:43.074 --> 40:47.454
Just listen. I am sorry
about Dominic. I really am.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.357
Now, look,

40:52.250 --> 40:54.821
Darius has big connections on the mainland.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.861
They sent him here over here to
avoid prosecution for murder.

40:57.922 --> 41:00.459
And so many other things
that'd turn your stomach.

41:00.525 --> 41:02.630
Can you try and understand that?

41:02.794 --> 41:05.172
Do what you can. I'll help you.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.534
But there's no way.

41:07.598 --> 41:10.738
If you're afraid of Darius,
you're dead already.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.976
You're what?

41:18.443 --> 41:19.979
I'm tak’n you in for questioning.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.421
What's wrong, Babbitt?

41:21.479 --> 41:25.484
Are you starting to think that piece
of scrap on your chest is for real?

41:25.550 --> 41:26.995
Come on, let's go.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.088
Is he serious?

41:29.721 --> 41:30.995
What's the charge?

41:31.055 --> 41:32.591
Suspicion of murder.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.500
Hey, cop,

41:36.427 --> 41:39.340
why don't you arrest me, my tie is dirty.

41:41.466 --> 41:43.070
I guess you've got me.

41:45.536 --> 41:46.844
You have the right to remain silent.

41:46.904 --> 41:48.713
You clown!

41:48.806 --> 41:51.514
You ridiculous fool.

41:52.710 --> 41:55.418
- Get rid of him.
- Wait. Hold it, hold it.

41:57.081 --> 41:59.186
What you gonna do? You gonna kill me, Darius?

41:59.250 --> 42:01.196
You gonna shove me off some
cliff with the other victims,

42:01.252 --> 42:03.528
or bury me in the sand, is that it?

42:04.122 --> 42:07.126
Where did you get this sudden strength?

42:07.191 --> 42:09.228
Are you high on something?

42:09.293 --> 42:12.433
Actually, I'm dead. Hawke was right.

42:13.097 --> 42:14.542
Until we do something about you,

42:14.599 --> 42:18.376
I'm as good as dead, we're all as
good as dead. Now come on, let's go.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.045
Aren't you gonna read us our rights?

42:25.843 --> 42:28.346
I see you're in good hands.

42:28.413 --> 42:30.586
I have to return to my guests.

42:35.653 --> 42:38.600
I don't believe it!

42:39.891 --> 42:41.928
11…! 11…!

42:43.694 --> 42:48.234
I don't believe it! I've never
been good at gambling before.

42:58.109 --> 42:59.713
Solly! Solly!

43:01.712 --> 43:03.919
Solly! Solly!

43:04.482 --> 43:06.359
Solly, what is that thing?

43:06.417 --> 43:07.657
Darius, I want you

43:07.718 --> 43:10.028
for the murder of Lylah Santini!

43:10.321 --> 43:11.800
What the hell is he talking about?

43:11.856 --> 43:13.335
It’s over, Darius.

43:13.391 --> 43:14.734
I thought you took care of him.

43:14.792 --> 43:16.533
Everyone else, clear out.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.302
Get that thing! Get that thing! Get it!

44:19.957 --> 44:21.527
Get him! Do something!

44:22.326 --> 44:24.306
- Get me out of here!
- With pleasure.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.672
I repeat, you're under arrest.

44:44.415 --> 44:46.588
All right, Hawke. The place is empty

44:46.651 --> 44:49.325
and we got Darius. Take it down.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.181
Welcome home, Mr. Santini.

45:48.246 --> 45:51.193
Hey, it's about time you
started calling me Dom.

45:51.249 --> 45:52.250
Okay.

45:54.185 --> 45:56.665
Listen, do you guys think
we can get that Sikorsky

45:56.721 --> 45:58.257
back in the air before sundown?

45:58.322 --> 46:00.393
I’d bet on it. What do you think, String?

46:00.458 --> 46:03.098
Yeah well, I think my gambling days are over.

46:20.311 --> 46:23.190
Hey Dom, what's hold’n you up?
