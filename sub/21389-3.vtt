00:00.179 --> 00:01.920
Previously on "Midnight, Texas"...

00:01.922 --> 00:04.126
- The weretiger is me.
- It's Midnight.

00:04.128 --> 00:06.118
You don't need to pretend you're normal.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.217
- Let your freak flag fly.
- Xylda said I should hide here.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.885
- Gypsy Xylda?
- You know my grandma?

00:10.886 --> 00:12.929
Olivia, you seem angry.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.244
I can take some of that from you.

00:15.246 --> 00:17.892
- What are you exactly?
- Vampires run red for it.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.979
Supernatural evil is being drawn here.

00:19.981 --> 00:22.857
The more that evil takes hold,
the more the veil frays.

00:22.859 --> 00:24.341
- Damn.
- Just curious...

00:24.343 --> 00:25.944
Is this about pissing off your dad?

00:25.946 --> 00:27.987
I'd say maybe 2%.

00:27.989 --> 00:29.574
I can live with that.

00:47.346 --> 00:49.133
I'm really late for dinner.

00:49.135 --> 00:51.923
I'm sorry. I hate to
"you know" and run,

00:51.925 --> 00:54.103
but II have to run, all right?

00:54.105 --> 00:58.050
Abrupt end to an otherwise
pretty good afternoon.

00:58.052 --> 00:59.268
Yeah.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.313
But, um, one of these days,

01:02.315 --> 01:04.245
it'd be nice to do dinner.

01:04.247 --> 01:06.816
Yeah, baby steps, all right?

01:06.817 --> 01:10.081
Have you seen my other earring?

01:10.083 --> 01:12.222
Um...

01:12.224 --> 01:14.365
It's fine. It's fine. Never mind.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.886
I just... I got to go.

01:15.888 --> 01:17.410
What happens if you're late?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.161
Your dad comes at me with a shotgun?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.829
Yeah, that's one possibility.

01:23.623 --> 01:25.435
Um...

01:25.437 --> 01:28.575
so you and I... this is fun, right?

01:28.577 --> 01:29.629
Yeah.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.310
Okay, well, for it to stay that way,

01:31.312 --> 01:33.979
it means that my dad does not find out.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.495
So we... we hang out,
we have a good time,

01:39.497 --> 01:41.309
no strings... is that what you're saying?

01:41.310 --> 01:43.443
Yeah, I'm pretty perfect?

01:45.147 --> 01:47.607
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.568
So at least let me walk you home.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.903
Last time we were out at
night didn't go so well.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.875
Yeah, but it's not a full moon, and
there's no weretiger, so I'm fine.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.927
And one overprotective man
in my life is plenty.

02:17.584 --> 02:19.655
Hello to you, baby doll.

02:20.845 --> 02:24.062
What you doing all alone, sweetness?

02:24.064 --> 02:25.430
Walking home.

02:25.432 --> 02:27.063
And if I'm not there in three minutes,

02:27.065 --> 02:28.822
people are gonna come looking for me.

02:28.824 --> 02:31.324
Is that so?

02:34.847 --> 02:37.330
I'm not scared of you.

02:37.333 --> 02:41.025
Really? How about now?

02:51.109 --> 02:53.042
Zachariah?

02:53.045 --> 02:54.345
Lem.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.715
It's been a long time.

02:58.741 --> 03:01.274
- What happened?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

03:01.276 --> 03:03.512
- You don't seem fine.
- You look scared.

03:03.515 --> 03:05.282
I didn't mean to scare anyone.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.547
- What did you do to her?
- Everyone, calm down.

03:07.549 --> 03:10.383
- Lem, you know these folks?
- Zach's an old friend.

03:10.385 --> 03:12.419
- Yeah, nice friends.
- My apologies.

03:12.421 --> 03:14.654
We were just having a little fun.

03:14.656 --> 03:16.436
If I knew you were a
friend of Lem's, I...

03:16.439 --> 03:18.592
Everyone in Midnight is a friend.

03:18.594 --> 03:20.761
I'm not looking for trouble.

03:20.763 --> 03:23.230
- Then why are you here?
- Looking for you.

03:23.232 --> 03:25.371
We were passing through
on the way to Mazatlan,

03:25.374 --> 03:27.374
thought we'd stop for the night.

03:27.377 --> 03:29.477
Place brings back memories...

03:29.480 --> 03:30.779
when we were all together.

03:30.782 --> 03:33.416
That was a long time ago.

03:33.419 --> 03:34.785
Too long.

03:38.608 --> 03:40.875
I live and work here.

03:40.877 --> 03:43.911
Just as dusty and
crowded as I remembered it.

03:43.913 --> 03:47.381
It's not as charming as
your old bus, but I make do.

03:47.383 --> 03:49.817
Hey, don't knock it till you try it.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.003
- Hey.
- Olivia, this is Zach...

03:52.006 --> 03:53.648
An old friend.

03:55.085 --> 03:56.751
My pleasure.

03:58.456 --> 04:00.056
Vampire.

04:00.059 --> 04:03.658
- Just like Lem here.
- No one's like Lem.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.336
- She's feisty.
- And offlimits.

04:06.339 --> 04:09.564
Zach and I go way back.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.366
It's funny... He's
never mentioned you.

04:11.368 --> 04:14.211
I'm not surprised.

04:14.214 --> 04:17.672
The last time we saw each other,
we had a little falling out.

04:17.673 --> 04:21.409
As I remember, it
was more than little.

04:21.411 --> 04:22.944
You're right.

04:22.946 --> 04:26.147
It cost me my closest friend.

04:26.149 --> 04:28.216
I'm asking for a second chance.

04:28.218 --> 04:31.152
I'm hoping we can put
that bad blood behind us.

04:31.154 --> 04:33.755
Speaking of blood...

04:33.757 --> 04:36.191
- Ground rules?
- No feeding on Midnighters

04:36.193 --> 04:38.460
or anyone in the
county, for that matter.

04:38.462 --> 04:41.429
And locals are offlimits.

04:41.431 --> 04:43.498
I understand.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.167
We bring our meals to go.

04:46.170 --> 04:48.697
You've turned over a new leaf?

04:48.699 --> 04:51.534
Long time ago, you told
me you got tired of the hunt.

04:51.536 --> 04:53.669
It took me longer to see the light.

04:53.671 --> 04:56.272
We don't kill humans to feed anymore.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.376
Well, in that case,

05:00.378 --> 05:02.211
welcome back to Midnight, brother.

05:03.881 --> 05:06.315
My man.

05:07.719 --> 05:10.113
So the old hotel's still open?

05:10.115 --> 05:11.915
Hotel's been gone a while,

05:11.917 --> 05:13.466
but the restaurant's still around.

05:13.469 --> 05:14.884
Let's check it out.

05:14.886 --> 05:17.787
We'll party like it's 1959.

05:19.591 --> 05:22.559
- We'll join you there.
- Okay.

05:28.834 --> 05:30.800
Do you trust him?

05:30.802 --> 05:34.404
Zach is like a brother to me.

05:34.407 --> 05:36.703
You didn't answer the question.

05:36.705 --> 05:38.939
He says he's changed.

05:38.941 --> 05:42.576
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

05:42.578 --> 05:44.544
Why?

05:44.546 --> 05:46.380
Because I owe him my life.

06:07.002 --> 06:09.369
Aah!

06:09.371 --> 06:12.973
Don't. If they find you...

06:12.976 --> 06:16.037
What will they do to me
that they haven't already done?

06:16.039 --> 06:18.606
You'll be hanged.

06:18.608 --> 06:22.777
I'd rather hang. This is not a life.

06:22.779 --> 06:24.645
If there's a way out,

06:24.647 --> 06:26.647
I must try.

06:26.649 --> 06:28.950
Those are just stories, rumors.

06:31.821 --> 06:33.754
Come with me, Abraham.

06:33.756 --> 06:35.656
We'll be free.

07:10.685 --> 07:15.554
You're far from home, slave.

07:15.556 --> 07:18.490
I heard stories about you...

07:21.295 --> 07:24.129
That you can offer freedom.

07:24.131 --> 07:25.723
I can.

07:28.402 --> 07:30.636
But it's gonna cost you.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.707
There's no turning back.

07:34.709 --> 07:37.376
There's no turning back for me.

07:37.378 --> 07:40.412
Either way, I die.

07:40.414 --> 07:42.314
In that case...

08:29.421 --> 08:31.688
A nest of vampires dropping in.

08:31.690 --> 08:33.557
This an everyday thing?

08:33.559 --> 08:35.799
Lem's the only vampire I've ever seen.

08:35.801 --> 08:39.402
Me too. Things are
getting real weird here.

08:39.404 --> 08:41.938
Aubrey and the Sheriff getting killed.

08:41.940 --> 08:43.773
And the Rev getting out.

08:43.775 --> 08:46.810
- Demons under your house.
- And, vampires. Delightful.

08:46.812 --> 08:49.145
Vampires avoid Midnight.

08:49.148 --> 08:50.957
Lemuel's an energyleaching vampire.

08:50.959 --> 08:55.761
Olivia told me all
about how she and Lem...

08:55.763 --> 08:59.165
Never mind. Go... go on.

08:59.168 --> 09:02.587
Lemuel can kill vampires,
which is why they stay away.

09:02.589 --> 09:05.241
And Lem and Zach... They seem close.

09:05.244 --> 09:08.779
Come on, they're vampires.
They kill and feed on people.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.915
He's right. Even though
Lem vouched for him,

09:10.917 --> 09:12.483
we can't let our guard down.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.118
They said they'd be gone by sunrise.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.053
If anything happens, we'll gather here.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.599
The church is sanctuary.

09:17.602 --> 09:20.691
FYI, garlic, holy water,

09:20.693 --> 09:22.893
them needing to be invited inside...

09:22.895 --> 09:23.894
All lies.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.496
So how do you kill them?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.998
Silver's poison, debilitates them.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.967
But to end their lives, it's either sun

09:29.969 --> 09:34.238
or a wooden stake through the heart.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.339
Awesome.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.403
Making themselves at home.

09:46.405 --> 09:48.438
Well, this was their home once.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.507
Wow. This place is different.

09:50.509 --> 09:52.013
I remember the bar was over there,

09:52.016 --> 09:53.528
and the piano was in the back.

09:53.531 --> 09:55.779
Hey, I...

09:57.249 --> 10:00.583
Olivia, this is Pia.

10:00.585 --> 10:02.719
Another old friend?

10:02.721 --> 10:04.954
I like her.

10:04.956 --> 10:07.257
Lem always had good taste in women.

10:07.259 --> 10:11.469
Well, you guys all have
a lot of catching up to do.

10:11.472 --> 10:14.364
I feel a migraine coming on.

10:15.834 --> 10:18.802
You don't have a migraine, do you?

10:18.804 --> 10:20.804
You guys have fun.

10:20.806 --> 10:22.872
I'll see you later.

10:24.843 --> 10:26.943
When they're gone.

10:32.551 --> 10:35.251
See you in the morning.

10:35.253 --> 10:37.858
Wait, I won't.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.555
Olivia.

10:48.557 --> 10:51.258
What?

10:51.260 --> 10:52.907
Lem's friends... You trust them?

10:52.910 --> 10:55.228
I don't know them. I
don't know you either.

10:55.230 --> 10:56.596
I know a grift when I see it.

10:56.598 --> 10:58.498
Takes a con man to know a con man?

10:58.501 --> 11:00.519
Maybe. But either way,

11:00.521 --> 11:02.388
those vampires are up to something.

11:02.390 --> 11:04.290
Yeah.

11:04.292 --> 11:07.159
- You have my attention.
- I can talk to dead people.

11:07.161 --> 11:09.462
Vampires make dead people.

11:09.464 --> 11:11.597
If there are ghosts in there,

11:11.599 --> 11:14.267
maybe they can tell us what
Zach and his friends are up to.

11:17.405 --> 11:19.939
I need a lookout...

11:19.941 --> 11:22.642
unless you really think
they're not dangerous.

11:44.418 --> 11:46.284
No vamps.

12:01.506 --> 12:04.340
Not sensing any spirits yet.

12:16.755 --> 12:19.377
- God.
- A ghost?

12:19.380 --> 12:20.813
Worse.

12:25.702 --> 12:27.101
They bled her to death.

12:29.468 --> 12:31.501
Not quite.

12:37.564 --> 12:39.599
We need to get you out of here.

12:39.601 --> 12:41.567
Why?

12:41.569 --> 12:44.470
- Look at where you are.
- You lost a lot of blood.

12:44.472 --> 12:48.241
I didn't lose it. I gave it.

12:48.243 --> 12:51.077
I hitched a ride back in Tulsa.

12:51.079 --> 12:53.279
I'm having a blast.

13:01.384 --> 13:02.850
You guys are doing just fine.

13:02.852 --> 13:04.585
You know Pia always gets her way.

13:12.962 --> 13:15.596
Remember Buenos Aires?

13:15.598 --> 13:17.198
Yes.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.000
You tried to stake me.

13:24.915 --> 13:27.416
Olivia, Manfred, what's up?

13:27.418 --> 13:29.985
You should know, that
blood bag Zach's carrying...

13:29.987 --> 13:31.501
It's from a girl they're keeping

13:31.504 --> 13:33.555
- in the back of their bus.
- They're draining her.

13:33.557 --> 13:35.290
You were snooping around our bus?

13:35.292 --> 13:37.744
- You are in my town.
- It's okay, Pia.

13:37.747 --> 13:39.614
Can't blame them for being suspicious.

13:39.617 --> 13:41.550
We're used to it.

13:41.552 --> 13:43.419
Girl on the bus... Her name's Tiffany.

13:43.421 --> 13:44.678
She's a groupie.

13:44.681 --> 13:47.323
- It's true. It's a thing.
- A thing?

13:47.325 --> 13:49.892
Zach and Pia can't
drain energy like I can.

13:49.894 --> 13:53.295
They need blood. Groupies
are the most humane way...

13:53.297 --> 13:54.797
A willing food supply.

13:54.799 --> 13:56.866
Humane? She can barely move.

13:56.868 --> 13:58.300
A stop at the Waffle House,

13:58.302 --> 14:00.269
and Tiffany will be as good as new.

14:00.271 --> 14:01.637
It's a hard thing to understand,

14:01.639 --> 14:04.240
since you're not one of us.

14:07.612 --> 14:09.178
All right, then...

14:09.180 --> 14:12.014
enjoy your reunion.

14:12.016 --> 14:13.919
I need a minute with Olivia.

14:16.782 --> 14:18.616
You hate them.

14:18.618 --> 14:20.451
Hey, I guess I
don't see what you see,

14:20.453 --> 14:22.519
since I'm not one of you.

14:22.521 --> 14:25.456
I've been a vampire a long while.

14:25.458 --> 14:29.827
Most of that time, Zach was by my side.

14:58.306 --> 15:01.409
Well...

15:01.412 --> 15:03.995
look who's here.

15:03.998 --> 15:08.313
I had to make an example out of Abraham.

15:08.316 --> 15:10.907
You cost me, boy.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.744
Now I own you.

15:15.364 --> 15:18.332
My God!

15:18.334 --> 15:20.934
Dinner's not over.

15:44.660 --> 15:47.327
Feel better?

15:47.329 --> 15:50.497
Yeah. Much better.

15:51.634 --> 15:53.762
All vampires are killers.

15:53.764 --> 15:55.931
- Except for Lem?
- He's the exception.

15:55.933 --> 15:58.200
He always has been,
but make no mistake...

15:58.202 --> 15:59.935
This nest is dangerous.

15:59.937 --> 16:01.203
You are food.

16:01.205 --> 16:03.972
Lem said they changed. People do change.

16:03.974 --> 16:06.389
Are you willing to
bet your life on it?

16:06.392 --> 16:08.477
You have to protect yourself.

16:12.049 --> 16:14.416
Remind me again why you
thought I'd be safe here.

16:14.418 --> 16:15.750
Midnight's safe.

16:15.752 --> 16:18.053
You just might have to
fight to keep it that way.

16:26.897 --> 16:28.597
- Hey.
- Come in.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.634
Looks like we're both
worried about the same thing.

16:32.636 --> 16:35.370
Great minds worry alike.

16:35.372 --> 16:37.806
This is...

16:37.808 --> 16:40.375
Is for you.

16:40.377 --> 16:44.772
I adjusted it, so instead of arrows...

16:47.171 --> 16:49.505
You can stake one
without getting too close.

16:50.866 --> 16:55.177
I just want you to be
able to protect yourself.

16:55.179 --> 16:56.245
Tha... thank you.

17:05.917 --> 17:07.818
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.653
Don't worry.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.954
I saw Fiji lift a car, Creek.

17:11.957 --> 17:15.492
I know Lem's not exactly the same as us.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.060
Tell me what's going on.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.667
There's a nest of
vampires in Midnight.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.137
- Like Uncle Lem.
- No.

17:27.138 --> 17:28.839
They're nothing like Lem.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.575
- So should we be worried?
- No.

17:31.577 --> 17:33.110
We should be prepared.

17:35.314 --> 17:37.681
Go get a knife.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.395
I don't think I've ever
seen you in my church before.

17:56.397 --> 17:59.264
First time for everything.

17:59.266 --> 18:01.300
Chuy's in El Paso...

18:01.302 --> 18:02.901
NailCon.

18:02.903 --> 18:04.803
No one comes here for company.

18:04.805 --> 18:08.740
Sanctuary, confession, yes.

18:08.742 --> 18:13.178
I'm assuming it's the latter.

18:13.180 --> 18:15.614
The reason you haven't
seen me here before...

18:19.520 --> 18:22.587
I'm fallen.

18:22.589 --> 18:25.624
I once was an angel.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.225
And now?

18:27.228 --> 18:29.743
Now I'm living a grounded life

18:29.745 --> 18:31.779
with someone I love.

18:31.781 --> 18:34.048
And it's a life I want to protect.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.849
And you think the
nest threatens that.

18:35.851 --> 18:38.919
Vampires are just the
beginning of the threat.

18:38.921 --> 18:42.089
I guess when an angel
comes heralding a warning,

18:42.092 --> 18:43.945
I suppose I should listen.

18:43.947 --> 18:45.746
Fallen angel.

18:45.748 --> 18:47.715
I'm speaking to you as
a neighbor and a friend.

18:47.717 --> 18:49.517
And a reverend...

18:49.519 --> 18:52.987
who will hear your confession
and keep your secret.

18:54.824 --> 18:57.558
The veil that Midnight sits upon...

18:57.560 --> 18:59.861
It's fraying...

18:59.863 --> 19:02.230
and evil is being drawn here.

19:02.232 --> 19:05.166
You've felt it, haven't you?

19:05.168 --> 19:07.268
Last time I turned,

19:07.270 --> 19:10.771
the hunger was insatiable.

19:10.773 --> 19:14.242
- So what do we do about this?
- There's no we.

19:14.244 --> 19:16.711
Chuy and I may not be here much longer.

19:16.714 --> 19:20.422
And after we're gone, someone
needs to know the truth,

19:20.424 --> 19:21.790
'cause there will come a time

19:21.792 --> 19:24.626
when Midnighters are gonna
have to make a choice...

19:24.628 --> 19:28.597
To leave or to fight.

20:11.987 --> 20:15.756
A pencil? You got to
pierce the heart, pretty boy.

20:26.132 --> 20:28.866
They killed the hardware store guy.

20:28.868 --> 20:32.036
His name was Henry.
He was a good man.

20:32.038 --> 20:33.037
They lied.

20:33.039 --> 20:34.472
They killed him,

20:34.474 --> 20:35.940
and anyone in town could be next.

20:35.942 --> 20:37.141
Waiting for sunrise...

20:37.143 --> 20:39.944
Not that great a plan anymore?

20:39.946 --> 20:41.712
We need to warn everyone.

20:41.714 --> 20:44.682
It's time for Mass.

20:44.684 --> 20:47.952
Poor Henry.

20:47.954 --> 20:50.621
At least we're safe.

20:50.623 --> 20:53.924
My house is
inhospitable to the dead.

20:53.926 --> 20:57.328
It's why I never invite Lem for dinner.

20:57.331 --> 20:59.029
Hey, we need to be ready.

20:59.031 --> 21:00.931
Go on offense. There's
a lot of vampires.

21:00.933 --> 21:02.533
We need more than crossbows and stakes.

21:02.535 --> 21:04.902
We need... targeted weapons.

21:04.904 --> 21:07.104
What, like supernatural weapons?

21:07.106 --> 21:08.772
You're a witch...

21:08.774 --> 21:11.041
in a witchcraft store.

21:11.043 --> 21:13.577
We need to get creative.

21:13.579 --> 21:16.413
Creative...

21:16.415 --> 21:19.903
I can do that.

21:32.030 --> 21:36.466
I begged for months.

21:36.468 --> 21:39.870
Then finally, New Year's Eve...

21:39.872 --> 21:43.640
1888, Zach caved.

21:43.642 --> 21:45.976
A rare moment of weakness.

21:45.978 --> 21:47.811
And that's how little Pia

21:47.813 --> 21:50.847
was brought into the family.

21:50.849 --> 21:53.516
You ever gonna turn Olivia?

21:53.518 --> 21:56.353
I'm not interested.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.955
Wait till you spot
your first crow's feet.

22:01.459 --> 22:03.526
Would you two mind giving me and Lem

22:03.528 --> 22:06.529
a few minutes alone, please?

22:06.531 --> 22:08.665
Sure.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.934
I'll be in the bar.

22:18.343 --> 22:21.842
Must be nice being here.

22:21.845 --> 22:23.912
It's a cold world out
there for our kind.

22:23.915 --> 22:27.183
We're always on the
run. It's exhausting.

22:27.185 --> 22:28.684
Why are you here, Zachariah?

22:28.686 --> 22:30.719
You're not just passing
through, are you?

22:30.721 --> 22:34.390
I forgot how special this place was.

22:34.392 --> 22:38.961
Energy here is more
powerful than I remember.

22:38.963 --> 22:40.863
Midnight called to me.

22:40.865 --> 22:42.965
I feel like I belong here.

22:42.967 --> 22:46.235
We belong here.

22:46.237 --> 22:49.038
What are you asking me for?

22:49.040 --> 22:53.442
I'm asking you to let us stay.

22:55.746 --> 22:58.411
She's not answering.

22:58.414 --> 23:00.381
Why would they lie to Lem?

23:00.384 --> 23:04.119
Can't help it. Vamps
are bloodthirsty and cruel.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.587
Lem said they were friends.

23:05.589 --> 23:08.490
Once. A lot has happened since.

23:10.794 --> 23:14.329
There's something you need to know.

23:43.928 --> 23:46.127
You've been a party
pooper for months.

23:46.129 --> 23:50.265
We got you a gift to lift your spirits.

24:03.413 --> 24:06.213
Just close your eyes.
It'll hurt for a second.

24:06.215 --> 24:08.883
Then it'll feel good.

24:08.885 --> 24:10.484
And then it's over.

24:15.792 --> 24:19.193
Still a slave...

24:19.195 --> 24:22.797
And this time to blood.

24:28.071 --> 24:30.603
I can't do this anymore.

24:35.244 --> 24:37.010
Wait until daylight.

24:37.012 --> 24:41.882
Then sneak out the back
stairs. You'll be fine.

24:41.884 --> 24:45.753
- You're letting me go?
- Yes.

24:45.755 --> 24:47.788
Maybe I'll join you...

24:47.790 --> 24:51.992
Sneak into the daylight,
put an end to this.

24:51.994 --> 24:54.528
You don't have to kill yourself.

24:54.530 --> 24:57.030
You can change.

24:57.033 --> 25:01.401
I chose my path a long time ago.

25:01.403 --> 25:04.704
It's never too late.

25:04.706 --> 25:07.607
Do you want to put
this curse behind you?

25:07.609 --> 25:09.342
I can help you.

25:12.414 --> 25:15.015
Who are you?

25:15.017 --> 25:17.916
My name is Xylda.

25:27.195 --> 25:29.462
Enjoy the girl?

25:34.402 --> 25:38.171
What did she do to you?

25:38.173 --> 25:40.273
She saved me.

25:43.673 --> 25:46.245
That gypsy girl made
you turn your back on us.

25:46.247 --> 25:49.079
I gave you eternal life.

25:49.082 --> 25:52.484
I ran away from evil,
only to become worse.

25:52.486 --> 25:53.985
If it wasn't for Xylda,

25:53.987 --> 25:55.520
I would've ended my eternal life.

25:55.522 --> 25:58.223
So instead, she gave
you ultimate power.

25:58.225 --> 26:01.860
- Power over us.
- I didn't want power.

26:01.862 --> 26:04.229
- But you did.
- I made you.

26:04.231 --> 26:07.265
- We're family.
- My family's here now.

26:07.267 --> 26:10.730
I'm sorry, but you can't stay.

26:14.574 --> 26:18.042
Mazatlan it is.

26:19.512 --> 26:23.214
Lem, it was good to see
you after all this time.

26:23.216 --> 26:25.149
You know?

26:25.151 --> 26:28.086
You too.

26:30.123 --> 26:33.358
Let's not end the night this way?

26:35.195 --> 26:38.663
A drink? For old times' sake.

26:38.665 --> 26:39.897
What do you say?

26:42.936 --> 26:45.570
Right.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.686
To old friends.

26:53.689 --> 26:57.448
- I'll miss you, Zach.
- I'll miss you.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.520
What are they doing?

27:03.522 --> 27:05.789
Zach's reminding Lem who he is.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.624
Blood's thicker than water.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.230
Yeah, safe travels.

27:26.403 --> 27:27.436
What did you do?

27:27.439 --> 27:28.887
He drank blood laced with silver.

27:28.890 --> 27:30.493
And I got something else for you.

27:33.930 --> 27:35.363
No!

27:35.365 --> 27:37.298
You're taking her place, bitch.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.967
Aah!

27:44.054 --> 27:45.120
Aah!

27:45.976 --> 27:47.742
Kill 'em all!

27:56.988 --> 27:59.386
First time we've
gathered the town for Mass

27:59.389 --> 28:00.888
in a long while.

28:00.890 --> 28:03.157
Still waiting on
Manfred and the Lovells.

28:07.697 --> 28:09.897
Nothing out back. It's quiet.

28:09.899 --> 28:12.633
Okay.

28:12.635 --> 28:14.235
Hang on.

28:20.550 --> 28:23.343
Whoa, whoa. It's me.

28:23.345 --> 28:25.212
I've been calling.

28:25.214 --> 28:27.180
Why? What are you doing here?

28:27.182 --> 28:29.899
The vampires... They're on the attack.

28:29.902 --> 28:32.094
- Y'all need to come with me.
- You again.

28:32.097 --> 28:33.860
I don't want you coming around here.

28:33.863 --> 28:35.288
Dad, you need to listen to him.

28:35.290 --> 28:36.990
No, I don't.

28:36.992 --> 28:39.960
Sorry, there's no time.

28:39.962 --> 28:42.028
We need to get somewhere safe, now.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.467
If he didn't like Manfred before...

28:47.469 --> 28:48.469
I know.

28:50.974 --> 28:55.298
- What's going on?
- Dad, just stay back.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.343
Hang on.

29:00.846 --> 29:02.880
He killed them.

29:02.883 --> 29:04.951
Turn around.

29:07.188 --> 29:09.118
- They're vampires, Dad.
- Vampires?

29:09.121 --> 29:11.324
I'm taking you to the church,
where vampires can't go.

29:11.326 --> 29:13.493
So shut up, sit down. You're welcome.

29:13.495 --> 29:15.294
Manfred!

29:19.234 --> 29:21.134
Change of plans. Hold on.

29:27.242 --> 29:29.042
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

29:36.884 --> 29:39.051
- What was that?
- Right.

29:39.053 --> 29:43.456
Fiji made this place,
um, inhospitable to the dead.

29:43.458 --> 29:46.826
Thanks, Fiji. Great.

29:46.829 --> 29:51.397
This quartz is sometimes
called the sunrise crystal.

29:51.399 --> 29:54.066
With light behind it, it
could emulate UV light,

29:54.068 --> 29:55.334
llike sunlight.

29:55.336 --> 29:56.969
Sounds more science than magic.

29:56.971 --> 29:59.838
Well, who's to say they're
not one in the same?

29:59.840 --> 30:02.074
I can make this work.

30:21.728 --> 30:23.528
I thought vampires couldn't get in.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.663
Me too.

30:35.909 --> 30:38.243
Get that out of my face!

30:38.245 --> 30:40.412
You're okay. Great!

30:40.414 --> 30:42.247
No, not great.

30:42.249 --> 30:44.716
I didn't make it to the chapel.
There was too many of them.

30:44.719 --> 30:46.518
I knew your house would be safe.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.387
They have Lem. He can defend himself.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.122
Not anymore. They poisoned him.

30:51.124 --> 30:52.824
- What?
- With silver.

30:52.826 --> 30:55.126
He's completely defenseless
until it wears off.

30:55.128 --> 30:56.393
They're gonna kill him.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.862
Not if we kill them first.
We got sunlight now.

30:59.865 --> 31:01.731
They're all over town.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.301
What if we lure 'em to one spot

31:03.303 --> 31:06.070
and blast 'em with this?

31:08.050 --> 31:10.351
We're gonna need a bigger light.

31:14.914 --> 31:17.399
Sorry it came to this,

31:17.402 --> 31:20.536
but you didn't give me a choice.

31:20.539 --> 31:22.272
You took everything from me.

31:22.275 --> 31:23.942
You chose the life you're living.

31:23.945 --> 31:25.556
I took nothing from you.

31:25.558 --> 31:27.922
It doesn't matter.

31:27.925 --> 31:29.793
The sun will be up soon.

31:29.796 --> 31:31.662
You'll be gone.

31:31.665 --> 31:33.899
Those humans you call friends,

31:33.902 --> 31:36.803
they'll be dinner soon enough.

31:36.806 --> 31:39.904
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

31:44.010 --> 31:45.843
She freed me.

31:45.845 --> 31:47.678
She can free you, too.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.813
You'll never have to
kill another human again.

31:51.017 --> 31:54.818
Why would I want that?

31:56.814 --> 31:58.614
- They're food.
- We could live a life

31:58.617 --> 32:00.183
without killing, without bloodshed.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.459
I like the killing, the blood.

32:02.462 --> 32:06.029
You love the taste of
blood more than any of us.

32:06.031 --> 32:08.832
I'm happy the way I am.

32:08.834 --> 32:12.466
Then there's nothing left to say.

32:12.469 --> 32:15.036
Leave Midnight and never come back.

32:15.039 --> 32:17.907
This is is our home. We're not leaving.

32:17.910 --> 32:19.379
I won't let you stay.

32:19.382 --> 32:21.978
Don't forget who you are.

32:21.980 --> 32:24.881
I made you.

32:24.883 --> 32:27.017
I can unmake you.

32:29.688 --> 32:32.789
Take care of him.

32:41.933 --> 32:46.469
Wait. That's what
this gypsy girl gave you?

32:46.471 --> 32:50.073
Because I'll definitely
take some of that.

32:50.075 --> 32:52.976
You had your chance.

32:52.978 --> 32:55.111
Now leave.

32:55.113 --> 32:57.075
Or I'll end you, too.

33:41.593 --> 33:44.060
Aah!

33:50.269 --> 33:51.978
Aah!

33:58.820 --> 34:00.152
We have a problem.

34:00.154 --> 34:02.922
Olivia's hurt.

34:09.996 --> 34:12.364
Manfred...

34:12.366 --> 34:14.032
Olivia can't bring the light.

34:19.406 --> 34:21.873
We can't just sit here
and wait for them to die.

34:37.458 --> 34:40.158
- You here to apologize?
- No.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.226
But upside for you...

34:42.230 --> 34:45.864
If this doesn't work, you don't
have to worry about me anymore.

34:50.404 --> 34:52.670
Hey, Rev. We're gonna need that light.

34:55.375 --> 34:58.476
Manfred is willing to
risk his life to save Lem.

34:58.478 --> 35:01.379
But for it to work, we
need divine intervention.

35:04.117 --> 35:07.085
I have something for Zach.

35:07.087 --> 35:10.789
He wants the power that Lem
has, I can give it to him.

35:10.791 --> 35:12.590
That's right. Back off.

35:15.329 --> 35:17.562
He's an idiot.

35:17.564 --> 35:21.199
He's also out there
trying to save Lem.

35:21.201 --> 35:23.568
Zach!

35:23.570 --> 35:25.637
Come on out!

35:25.639 --> 35:28.540
I know what the gypsy girl did to Lem!

35:31.478 --> 35:34.212
I'm Xylda's grandson!

35:34.214 --> 35:38.183
I'll make you as powerful as Lem!

35:38.186 --> 35:40.284
Come on!

35:40.286 --> 35:41.419
Want to make a deal?

35:41.421 --> 35:44.322
Manfred, no!

35:44.324 --> 35:47.025
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

35:47.027 --> 35:48.660
hallowed be Thy name...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.968
What do you want in return?

35:56.970 --> 35:59.537
Leave Midnight.

35:59.539 --> 36:01.572
That's not gonna happen.

36:01.574 --> 36:03.962
Well, how about letting me
and the rest of the town...

36:03.965 --> 36:06.344
Lem included... Walk out of here alive?

36:13.753 --> 36:15.086
Fair enough.

36:19.292 --> 36:21.559
Lead us not into temptation,

36:21.561 --> 36:23.194
but deliver us from evil...

36:47.987 --> 36:50.287
What is this?

36:50.289 --> 36:51.588
A grift.

36:51.590 --> 36:54.858
Then you're a dead man.

37:01.634 --> 37:03.567
Aah!

37:23.822 --> 37:25.288
Lem.

37:25.290 --> 37:27.257
Lem.

37:27.259 --> 37:29.659
Okay, here. I got you.

37:31.797 --> 37:33.296
I got you!

37:33.298 --> 37:35.098
Aah!

37:35.100 --> 37:36.499
I can't break them.

37:36.501 --> 37:37.667
You have to help me.

37:37.669 --> 37:39.669
Too weak.

37:39.671 --> 37:41.538
Okay.

37:41.540 --> 37:44.074
Okay.

37:52.484 --> 37:56.086
Here, here, drink this.

38:38.781 --> 38:41.649
Olivia got to him in time.

38:41.651 --> 38:43.350
- Come on, man.
- It's safe?

38:43.352 --> 38:44.985
- It's safe.
- I can give you a ride.

38:56.231 --> 38:58.231
How'd you get the light up there?

38:58.233 --> 39:00.167
Snuck in.

39:00.169 --> 39:04.137
You really stepped up,
risking your life like that.

39:04.139 --> 39:05.338
Thank you.

39:05.340 --> 39:08.141
You saved everyone here.

39:19.955 --> 39:23.190
I never intended to taste your blood.

39:23.192 --> 39:25.792
I wasn't about to let you die.

39:25.795 --> 39:28.094
Even after you heard about who I was?

39:28.096 --> 39:29.763
Dark past?

39:29.765 --> 39:32.165
Join the club.

39:55.957 --> 39:57.890
Might want to clean up.

39:57.892 --> 40:00.193
For what?

40:00.195 --> 40:02.678
- Hey.
- Hi!

40:02.681 --> 40:05.198
Hi.

40:07.202 --> 40:10.002
- Embarrassing.
- Yeah.

40:10.004 --> 40:13.873
Um, um, about that hug.

40:13.875 --> 40:15.239
- I...
- God.

40:15.242 --> 40:16.975
Another embarrassing moment.

40:16.978 --> 40:18.544
Um...

40:18.546 --> 40:22.982
you know that I get
emotional when I'm scared...

40:22.984 --> 40:24.283
and a little crazy.

40:24.285 --> 40:26.185
And I feel so comfortable
around you and...

40:26.187 --> 40:27.286
Well, that's why I'm here.

40:27.288 --> 40:29.488
I want you to know that I do, too.

40:34.094 --> 40:36.661
You're my closest friend.

40:43.905 --> 40:47.873
I know I can always count on you.

40:47.875 --> 40:50.543
Yeah.

41:09.597 --> 41:13.565
Have you been sleeping
with that psychic?

41:13.567 --> 41:16.735
His name's Manfred,
and he saved our lives.

41:16.737 --> 41:18.837
No, I'm not sleeping with him.

41:18.839 --> 41:21.240
So stop looking for
trouble where there is none.

41:21.242 --> 41:23.342
That guy is trouble.

41:23.344 --> 41:26.945
He's the definition of trouble.

41:30.017 --> 41:32.084
Keep away from him.

41:32.086 --> 41:34.853
He is going to lead
you down the wrong path.

42:01.682 --> 42:03.882
Can I hitch a ride?
