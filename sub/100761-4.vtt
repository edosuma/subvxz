WEBVTT

00:10.344 --> 00:12.346
-I'm overdressed.
-No, you look smart.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.515
-Smart? I'm not sure smart's really the--
-Okay, Jen's inside.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.017
It's like they found all the clothes
that I threw away in the '90s

00:17.100 --> 00:18.268
and they're wearing them ironically.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.979
-I'm really excited.
-Yeah, me too.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.356
When was the last time we did this?

00:22.439 --> 00:24.441
Don't know. But I think there was
a Blockbuster over there.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.318
-There was not.
-I'm buzzing, man.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.694
I forget the energy you feel.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.488
Oi, oi, oi, oi!
Blood, blood, blood, blood!

00:29.571 --> 00:32.366
Here he is. Look, perfect timing,
as we're at the front of the queue.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.410
-Hello, mate.
-Happy birthday.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.663
-Thank you so much.
-Happy birthday!

00:37.746 --> 00:41.333
This was such a great call!
Oh, my God, I am so up for this.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.043
Tonight, we say yes to everything.

00:43.126 --> 00:46.338
This is gonna be one of those nights you
have to check Google to see what you did.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.590
No, let's not go too mad, please.
We have to be up quite early.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.758
It's his birthday.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.594
-Are you going to a christening after?
-See?

00:52.678 --> 00:54.221
-Oh, this is us.
-No.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.431
-I'm wearing a blazer.
-You look nice.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.516
Hello.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.788
No!

01:21.832 --> 01:22.833
Nice blazer.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.334
Oh, thank you.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.633
Oh, my God, I love that. It's so retro.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.719
-Who is that guy?
-Just a guy.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.388
He is so hot. When did you meet him?

01:36.471 --> 01:37.472
Tonight. Just on an app.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.892
God, it's so easy to get laid now.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.104
-Well, for some people.
-Yeah, but it's gross.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.440
No, I bet things were classier
in the olden days.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.902
No, not the olden days, but, you know?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.323
Come on.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.283
Yeah, let's go and have a dance. Come on.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.409
Okay.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.665
-Here you go, mate.
-Oh, hello.

02:06.585 --> 02:12.424
Look at them in their tight jeans
and their tight skin.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.301
It's over for us. You know that, right?

02:14.384 --> 02:17.262
-What is?
-Life, mate. It's over.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.097
Bloody hell, Freddy. Happy birthday.

02:20.807 --> 02:21.808
Cheers!

02:25.771 --> 02:26.980
That is horrible.

02:28.774 --> 02:29.816
Let's have another one.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
All right?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.664
Hello.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.874
-You having fun?
-Yeah. It's great, isn't it?

02:45.958 --> 02:47.668
Yeah, yeah. How long we staying?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.005
-A while, I think.
-Oh.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.582
What time is it?

03:27.291 --> 03:28.458
I don't know.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.421
I think I've just e-mailed my mum.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.549
Where are they? Where are they?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.051
Nikki?

03:39.928 --> 03:40.971
Nikki?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.893
Go! Why will you not just go?

03:45.976 --> 03:48.395
-Oi!
-This is taken. Sorry.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.980
Hey! Oh.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.650
This is not our taxi.
This is just someone's car.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.486
Thank you.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.197
What are you--

04:04.369 --> 04:06.663
Oh, God. Oh, wait, hang on.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.333
-Here.
-What's this?

04:09.416 --> 04:10.751
-Erica, no--
-Here, you should take that.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.461
Erica, it's not a taxi.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.754
I know that.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.881
I know that. I was just...

04:15.964 --> 04:19.676
I was just a little bit sick
in the back of the car.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.569
It's so hot in here.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.462
We should take off our clothes...

04:56.088 --> 04:57.130
I got mine off.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.220
I'm going to sleep now.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.431
No.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.020
I need to put you
in the recovery position.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.481
Don't fiddle with me.
Don't wanna go in it.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.652
There, you're safe now.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.881
Why's it bright?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.842
God, why's it so bright?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.218
Shut up.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.009
Oh, lovely. Thank you.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.903
Yeah, right.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.950
-Bloody hell.
-It's early.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.509
Who is it?

07:06.760 --> 07:07.845
No idea.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.626
Shit. You were supposed to be checking
the e-mails from the adoption people.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.336
-I thought you were.
-Well, we both were.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.005
It's a joint account.
That's why we set it up.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.424
-You weren't checking it.
-Well, because I thought you were.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.969
-Why would you think that?
-Nikki, you said it was on Monday.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.555
No, Jason. I asked if it was on Monday.
That was a question.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.223
There was an upward inflection
in my voice.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.142
There's always an upward inflection
in your voice.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.352
-That's just how people speak now.
-Well, then they shouldn't.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.400
Shit.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.197
Oh, hello.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.908
Oh, goodness, you're handsome.
Look at you.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.119
Look, I'm-- We've actually got
our days mixed up.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.746
We didn't realize
the home visit was today.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.830
Yes, I can see that.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.249
But if you want to come in
and wait inside,

08:19.333 --> 08:21.793
-we just need a few minutes.
-How many minutes?

08:21.877 --> 08:22.878
Shit!

08:24.087 --> 08:25.297
A few. Yeah.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.258
-Not off to a great start, are we?
-No.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.551
Hang on.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.679
I think, fortunately for you...

08:32.763 --> 08:35.849
Yeah. My three o'clock has canceled,
so I will come back then.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.184
My God, that's amazing. I'm so grateful.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.436
I imagine you are.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.647
-I will need biscuits.
-Absolutely.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.024
Hello.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.902
Right. I shall return at 3:00.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.779
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.489
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.220
We have four hours to make this flat
suitable for a child.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.092
-Washing up done.
-Oh, lovely.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.261
-What else?
-Take some stuff out the bin,

09:54.344 --> 09:56.263
-and put it in the recycling bin.
-Why?

09:57.014 --> 09:59.016
So it looks like we use it
more than we do.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.100
Gotcha.

10:02.811 --> 10:07.191
We need some more books.
We need a three-to-one book to DVD ratio.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.609
Throw out a lot of DVDs then?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.485
-Right, there's a box of books upstairs.
-Yeah.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.279
Take down all the ones
that make us look clever.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.572
I don't think we've got many of them.

10:13.655 --> 10:17.367
All right, just get rid of the diet ones
and the biographies of footballers.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.493
Okay.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.078
Jase.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.289
What do we say when she asks why we rent?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.791
We say, "Because we live in London."

10:26.502 --> 10:27.920
What's the matter? What?

10:28.003 --> 10:29.838
Well, it's just--

10:29.922 --> 10:31.715
-Well, it's not right, is it?
-What?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.634
It's just, it's not right.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.719
I wanted it to look like this.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.472
-You want it to look more middle-class?
-Yeah.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.016
If you want it to look middle-class,
then we shouldn't have tidied up.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.559
All this stuff, it should be--

10:42.643 --> 10:43.810
-What?
-Like, mismatched.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.522
-It is all mismatched, innit?
-No, not in the ways that ours is.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.399
Like, intentionally.
There should be candles everywhere.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.778
And a digital radio on a stepladder
that is also a shelf.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.531
Oh, we should get rid of the TV.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.828
-No, it's not great, is it?
-No.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.665
It looks like we've been burgled.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.167
We need some better stuff in here.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.044
You been paid yet?

11:17.970 --> 11:19.346
Here's some kiddie stuff here. Look.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.139
Hello. Hi.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.267
-Right, that little plane.
-Yeah, it looks good.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.351
Yeah, that looks...

11:29.690 --> 11:30.858
Oh, this is nice.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.361
-Incense? Okay.
-Yes, incense.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.159
All right.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.871
-Don't suppose I get a bit of fudge?
-No.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.205
That's nice.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.961
Twenty-eight pounds.
What is that, for soap?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.213
She's the one who decides
if we get a child, Jason.

11:53.297 --> 11:54.798
We're not gonna use it.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.384
We're just gonna put it out for show
and then return it.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.971
-Hi.
-Can we get one of those, please?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.181
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.349
-Anything else?
-Do you do returns?

12:04.433 --> 12:05.434
-Yeah.
-Okay. Lovely.

12:05.517 --> 12:06.935
-Yeah.
-Fill your boots. Yeah, lovely.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.687
-This is nice.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:08.770 --> 12:09.855
-Get a couple of them.
-That one?

12:16.653 --> 12:17.779
We're not gonna--

12:20.365 --> 12:22.201
What about that mongoose thing up there?

12:23.619 --> 12:26.205
Don't be silly. What about that?
What do you think to that?

12:26.288 --> 12:28.373
I think we've spent
more than we can afford already.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.959
-It'd look good next to the sofa though.
-How much is it?

12:31.710 --> 12:34.296
Two hundred quid
for an old lamp like that?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.173
-Yeah, it's stupid.
-I mean...

12:37.216 --> 12:39.426
Do you know whose house
is full of old stuff like this?

12:39.510 --> 12:40.511
Go on.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.850
-Thanks for the lamp, Dad.
-You're welcome, love.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.228
What about these cushions?
They look grown-up.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.313
Yeah. But I don't know if they'll go
with our rug though, will they?

12:51.396 --> 12:52.981
I was thinking
maybe we could take the rug too.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.566
Take this one here?
Can we just have it?

12:54.650 --> 12:56.360
John, can we take the rug, mate?
Is that all right?

12:57.069 --> 12:59.238
-Yeah.
-Yeah? All right, lovely.

12:59.947 --> 13:00.948
Just...

13:01.406 --> 13:03.867
If you could see your way clear
to leaving the chairs.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.996
We're having Kath and Rog over,
and, I mean, I could lean, but...

13:08.080 --> 13:10.040
Dad, we're not gonna take your--

13:12.209 --> 13:14.127
We're not gonna take your chairs, Dad.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.672
I'll tell you what.
You got any books, John?

13:16.755 --> 13:19.049
I'll go and check the library
in the east wing.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.133
Lovely.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.885
Can I get you something to eat
before you go?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.763
-A lasagna or a shepherd's pie?
-Nah. Mum, we can't.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.474
I can make them both,
and then you can decide when you see them.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.143
We can't. We've gotta shoot off.
She's gonna be there at 3:00.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.523
-I'll just go and turn the oven off then.
-Gutted. Yeah.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.525
-All right, what else can we use?
-What about that?

13:36.608 --> 13:39.027
-It's actually a nice painting, that.
-Yeah. It's Tynemouth Harbor.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.113
Is it? Well, he's done a good job on it.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.990
Saved us a trip.
We haven't gotta go now.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.242
-Just some cake then?
-Oh, wow.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.036
-Homemade drizzle.
-Amazing bit of lemon drizz, yeah.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.291
You got a Tupperware for that, Jilly?
And a couple of biscuits would be lovely.

13:56.170 --> 13:59.673
We should think of things that make her
feel sorry for us, like X Factor.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.510
It works. It works every time.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.763
Tell her about when you were bullied.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.225
-It was hardly bullying. I mean--
-Use your pain, Jason.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.772
I think it would look better
if we were married.

14:15.856 --> 14:19.526
Well, you never know. We might be.
I mean, we were pretty drunk last night.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.408
Seriously feel like I might be sick.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.870
Okay. Well, don't do it on the rug.

14:58.774 --> 14:59.775
What's happening?

15:00.692 --> 15:02.778
This gap's too wide.
A kid could fall through.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.405
They're strict on things like that.
Gonna have to replace it.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.699
That sounds expensive.
Can't we just get a fatter kid?

15:09.493 --> 15:10.577
What are you wearing?

15:13.455 --> 15:14.456
Okay.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.209
What do you think?

15:19.962 --> 15:21.964
Jason, how many Ramones T-shirts
have you got?

15:22.047 --> 15:23.131
I don't know. I'm a fan.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.425
But you can be a fan of the band
without dressing like their roadie.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.553
-Well, what then?
-I don't know.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.681
Something that hasn't been fired out
of a T-shirt cannon.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.148
Hello. Hi, hi.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.901
-Can I leave this out here? It's wet.
-Oh, no. Did you get caught in the rain?

15:42.985 --> 15:44.069
No.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.280
-Yeah. Okay--
-No, no, no. Don't touch it,

15:46.363 --> 15:48.198
'cause my two o'clock did not go well.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.285
-Okay.
-Okay, I'll just leave it here?

15:51.368 --> 15:53.078
-Pop it there. By all means, yeah.
-Thank you.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.621
-Come in, please.
-Thank you.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.498
All ready?

15:57.082 --> 15:58.959
-Just go up.
-All right.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.343
-You just wanna go up.
-Oh, all right. Okay.

16:08.427 --> 16:09.428
Nikki, this is Penny.

16:09.511 --> 16:10.512
-Penny, Nikki.
-Hello.

16:10.596 --> 16:12.890
Lovely to meet you.
Oh, that's a nice plant.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.600
Yeah, we've had it since August.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.103
-Right. Lovely.
-And that's Tynemouth Harbor.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.232
-Okay.
-Shall we--

16:22.316 --> 16:24.943
-Yeah. Do you wanna go through?
-All right, thank you.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.906
Yes, I mean,
I know how to take a bottle of piss.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.034
This is not my first rodeo.
There is a knack to it.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.911
Don't touch the jacket outside.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.788
The instinct is to put your hands
out like that to try and stop it.

16:36.872 --> 16:38.373
Issue there is, where is it hitting?

16:38.457 --> 16:40.250
-On your-- and your--
-Hands and face, that's right.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.754
So, what you do is you put your hands
down by your side and you turn.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.297
'Cause it's hitting anyway.
There's no happy ending.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.132
So minimize it. Let the back get it.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.301
I know that they are all God's children

16:49.384 --> 16:52.513
and I'm not supposed to want
to wring their piss-throwing necks.

16:52.596 --> 16:55.015
And I know that he's like that
because his parents were like that.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.267
They're like that because their parents
were like that, and their parents--

16:57.351 --> 16:58.602
The whole cycle. I know all that.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.022
But at some point, someone's got to take
responsibility for their actions, right?

17:02.105 --> 17:04.398
How far back do you have to go
trying to pass the blame?

17:04.483 --> 17:09.946
Back to the start of civilization
and the one giant caveman arsehole

17:10.030 --> 17:12.031
responsible for the whole world
of arseholes?

17:12.782 --> 17:15.868
Right. Oh, you are handsome.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.538
Girl, well done. Well done, you.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.122
Okay. So...

17:21.375 --> 17:22.376
Shall we?

17:27.297 --> 17:28.632
Delicious biscuits.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.343
Would you like some lemon drizzle, Penny?

17:31.426 --> 17:32.678
It's homemade.

17:32.761 --> 17:36.098
-By me, I homemade it.
-I'm fine, but thank you.

17:37.266 --> 17:40.352
So, as I said, today is just
a meet and greet for me

17:40.435 --> 17:42.396
and to have a little look at the flat.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.314
There will be many such meetings.

17:44.398 --> 17:46.900
It is not a test. I am on your side.

17:46.984 --> 17:49.278
This is about preparing you
for panel, okay?

17:49.361 --> 17:51.280
Team Nikki and Jason.

17:53.782 --> 17:54.992
That's great.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.494
So, a word of warning,
I can get a little bit personal.

17:57.578 --> 17:59.371
I do like to get in there
and have a nose around.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.290
-Oh, yeah. No, that's fine.
-Go for it.

18:01.373 --> 18:02.583
Okay. So...

18:03.834 --> 18:05.586
how often would you say you have sex?

18:08.589 --> 18:10.299
Yeah. I mean--

18:11.425 --> 18:12.718
Just a normal amount.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.636
And what is normal for you?

18:15.179 --> 18:16.805
-Three times a--
-Once a week.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.724
Ish.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.311
And you enjoy it?

18:25.397 --> 18:26.857
Yeah, yeah.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.358
Yeah, absolutely.

18:28.442 --> 18:32.279
I mean, obviously, I would imagine.
You know.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.156
And it's good for you too?

18:34.239 --> 18:37.117
Oh, yeah. God, yeah.
Of course, yeah. I'm a man.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.995
Can't imagine it being bad.
It'd be like a...

18:40.996 --> 18:43.123
be like a bad sunset or something.

18:43.749 --> 18:44.875
I'm sorry to ask,

18:44.958 --> 18:48.921
but it's just the best way
to gauge the strength of a relationship.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.840
And we need you strong,
and we need you resilient.

18:51.924 --> 18:53.008
So, keep it up!

18:53.091 --> 18:54.426
Oh, I am.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.222
-So, Jason, you are a...
-Yeah.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.474
-I'm a--
-He's a teaching supervisor.

19:02.476 --> 19:05.604
And I'm a travel logistics executive.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.149
Lovely.

19:09.233 --> 19:12.194
And this flat, it's...

19:14.238 --> 19:15.614
-It's rented.
-Yeah.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.658
-But we're very settled.
-Oh, yeah.

19:26.500 --> 19:30.420
Which is nice because I moved around
quite a lot as a kid, Penny,

19:30.504 --> 19:32.381
which was difficult 'cause I was fat.

19:32.464 --> 19:36.969
And I had curly hair, which was
an absolute lightning rod for the bullies.

19:37.803 --> 19:41.682
So, I was-- I was bullied.
I did get bullied.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.893
-Wasn't I? I was-- I got bullied.
-Yeah.

19:47.563 --> 19:48.897
It never leaves you.

19:48.981 --> 19:52.484
I'm nearly 60, and I still have nightmares
about St. Mary's.

19:52.568 --> 19:54.611
But it does not define you.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.780
Sorry, hang on a sec.
You're not nearly 60.

19:56.864 --> 20:00.576
-Yeah, I am.
-No. No, you can't-- What?

20:00.659 --> 20:03.203
Sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave our flat immediately,

20:03.287 --> 20:04.746
'cause you're obviously a witch, Penny.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.546
All right.
Should we have a little look around?

20:12.629 --> 20:14.840
Yeah, let's have a look
in the old kitchen.

20:17.509 --> 20:18.510
That was nice.

20:18.594 --> 20:21.597
-Are you flirting with our social worker?
-Yeah, and it's working, so...

20:22.306 --> 20:24.433
-Okay.
-Here's the kitchen.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.768
Sorry, it's a little bit of a mess.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.438
Quinoa.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.399
You're healthy eaters then?

20:32.482 --> 20:34.359
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. God, yeah.

20:34.443 --> 20:37.946
We love all that, don't we?
We love-- We love staying in shape.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.031
Yeah.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.326
Okay. So, what's a typical meal for you?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.786
-Well, last night, for instance,
-What did we have last night?

20:44.870 --> 20:46.955
-we had the grilled salmon,
-That's it.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.499
-brown rice, broccoli,
-Lovely.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.878
and a really nice, like,
lemon and ginger sauce.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.214
So, no chocolate and crisps
for your kids then?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.216
-No way. Not on my watch.
-Oh, God, no!

20:57.299 --> 20:58.675
Oh! You got the--

21:01.094 --> 21:03.639
-And then there's upstairs.
-Right.

21:06.475 --> 21:07.643
That's the bathroom.

21:08.143 --> 21:11.271
That's where we clean ourselves
and clean our teeth.

21:12.606 --> 21:15.651
-This is our room.
-It's very nice.

21:15.734 --> 21:18.737
-Oh, you've got the incense.
-Yeah.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.908
That's a lovely bedspread.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.046
Fine. And the kiddie's room?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.507
Yeah. That's just through here.

21:39.591 --> 21:40.717
Thank you.

21:50.561 --> 21:51.937
Oh, yeah.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.736
Well, it's a lovely room.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.864
-Thank you.
-Yes.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.575
Immaculate.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.495
May I use the loo?

22:09.288 --> 22:10.372
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.249
-It's just down here.
-Thank you.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.627
All right. Thank you.

22:23.010 --> 22:24.052
Yeah.

22:43.322 --> 22:44.323
Lovely.

22:59.838 --> 23:02.174
Okay, so this is something
to be getting on with.

23:02.257 --> 23:05.344
We call it a family map.
Gives us an idea of your support network.

23:05.844 --> 23:08.555
Couple of other bits and pieces
that need filling out.

23:08.639 --> 23:10.766
Contacts for references and so on.

23:10.849 --> 23:13.310
No morning sickness
but a lot of paper cuts.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.062
That's the deal. Okay then.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.022
-All right. Thank you.
-Thank you.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.400
No, sorry. I've got to say this.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.947
You're great, both of you.

23:25.197 --> 23:26.323
But...

23:27.449 --> 23:31.787
if I can give you some advice,
don't try to be those people.

23:32.621 --> 23:35.165
'Cause that's not who you are.
It's not who the kids are.

23:35.249 --> 23:38.710
They don't grow up in houses
with quinoa and rocking horses.

23:38.794 --> 23:41.713
We rip them out of their lives,
and we move them two miles away,

23:41.797 --> 23:44.049
and it might as well be
the other side of the world.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.593
So, what I'm saying is,

23:46.677 --> 23:50.097
less wooden doll's house,
more Barbie's rainbow castle.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.474
-You know what I mean?
-Totally. Yeah, yeah.

23:52.558 --> 23:54.726
We are Barbie's rainbow castle people,
really.

23:54.810 --> 23:58.188
I know you are. And I love you,
and I loved your crazy application form.

23:58.272 --> 24:01.400
And we will do our best to get you
approved and find you a child.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.736
And if we can't,
then you can just have my grandchildren.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.321
They're teenagers though, so they're vile.

24:06.405 --> 24:08.490
And it's okay that we rent,
because I heard that--

24:08.574 --> 24:10.868
Well, it's London. Everyone rents.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.412
Christ, anyone can buy a house
in bloody Norfolk.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.831
Okay, bye.

24:17.207 --> 24:18.208
Told you.

24:30.554 --> 24:31.555
Do you want these?

24:32.931 --> 24:34.016
Honey!

24:34.725 --> 24:36.226
Gay Santa's here.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.145
Come on, jingle bells.

24:41.565 --> 24:44.484
Well, you gotta make me an offer.
I'm not just gonna give it to you.

24:44.568 --> 24:47.154
See that soap there? Twenty-eight pounds.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.572
-What?
-Yeah. Never been used.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.949
Is it stolen? I mean, I don't mind.
Just so I know.

24:51.033 --> 24:53.702
"Stolen." This is legit, mate.
Don't worry about that.

24:54.578 --> 24:57.623
How was the rest of your night?

24:57.706 --> 25:00.792
It was all right.
I think I bought a drone.

25:01.293 --> 25:04.713
Well, I've just been flirting with
a 60-year-old woman to get a kid.

25:04.796 --> 25:06.381
That wasn't really on my road map either.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.094
-Hiya.
-Oh. There she is. Look.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.597
-All right?
-No.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.140
I was sick in the bath.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.434
Don't worry about that.
We've all done that.

25:17.518 --> 25:19.228
While I was having a bath.

25:20.771 --> 25:23.232
-Oh, all right.
-Oh, God.

25:23.649 --> 25:27.528
-We are getting too old to do this.
-No, we're in our prime.

25:27.945 --> 25:30.989
-Daddy!
-Coming! Ready or not!

25:31.073 --> 25:32.824
-What's that, hide and seek?
-Yeah.

25:34.326 --> 25:35.827
How long have they been hiding?

25:36.828 --> 25:37.996
About an hour?

25:38.539 --> 25:40.874
Don't look at me like that.
I'm a good mum.

25:40.958 --> 25:41.959
Yeah.

25:44.711 --> 25:48.340
Oh, my God. I will pay you 700 quid
to go and change that baby.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.761
What, seriously?

25:57.057 --> 25:58.392
I'll do it.

25:58.475 --> 26:01.019
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Seven hundred.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.355
I'll hold you to that.

26:10.487 --> 26:12.990
I need your parents' date of birth
for the references.

26:13.073 --> 26:15.409
Do you think it's too late to say
they died in a terrible fire?

26:15.492 --> 26:17.786
-Yeah, I think it would've come up.
-Okay.

26:18.871 --> 26:22.165
So, if he's-- How old is he? Sixty-five...

26:22.249 --> 26:23.959
-Who's that?
-It's Jen.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.252
What she want?

26:25.752 --> 26:27.671
-Do we wanna go out again?
-When?

26:28.964 --> 26:29.965
Now.

26:31.216 --> 26:32.217
Now?

26:34.511 --> 26:35.596
To where?

26:35.679 --> 26:38.557
-Warehouse party in Deptford.
-Deptford?

26:40.559 --> 26:41.935
How do you get to Deptford?

26:43.437 --> 26:46.899
Right, so tube, a bus,
and a 15-minute walk.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.109
How long's all that take?

26:49.193 --> 26:51.236
-An hour and twenty.
-An hour and twenty?

26:54.823 --> 26:56.033
Yeah, all right.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.118
Okay.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.454
-Okay.
-Yeah.

27:00.537 --> 27:01.538
Let's do this.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.418
-All right? Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:07.085 --> 27:08.795
-Only if you want to.
-I definitely want to.

27:08.879 --> 27:10.714
-Okay, yeah.
-Do you? You--

27:10.797 --> 27:12.132
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.969
-Let's have some fun.
-Okay, no, that text wasn't meant for us.

27:16.053 --> 27:18.138
-Oh, my God. That's such good news.
-Okay.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.559
What do you reckon?
Early night and a Bake Off?

27:22.643 --> 27:24.144
-Oh, God, yeah.
-Go on. Get up there.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.894
Oh, no.

28:05.978 --> 28:08.814
That is not how you make
a rum and raisin cake.
