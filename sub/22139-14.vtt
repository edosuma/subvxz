WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.438
Oh, it's beautiful
to see the joining

00:04.538 --> 00:06.540
of the two great houses
of Cattleman's Ranch.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.576
MATTHEW: Yeah --
the Huangs and the Chestnuts.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.378
Hey, I can see
the stationery already.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.381
It's a lotus flower
and -- well, a chestnut.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.717
-So, that was it --
no notice, no nothing.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.052
We just had to
pick up and move.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.887
But we're used to
uprooting our lives

00:19.987 --> 00:21.522
at the whim
of Kenny Rogers.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.957
I get it.
Our move was hard, too.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.594
And we were the only Asian
family in the neighborhood.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.961
I so get that.

00:28.062 --> 00:30.864
We're the only
Latter-Day Saints on our block.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.601
I hear you. My mother-in-law
is in a wheelchair.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.104
I hear that.
I survived polio.

00:36.204 --> 00:41.442
**

00:41.542 --> 00:44.445
-You guys know how
to take off a bra?
-Goodbye.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.581
'Cause I do.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.750
Front, back, and sports.

00:49.850 --> 00:53.454
Me too.
I-I've got mad bra game.

00:53.554 --> 00:57.658
Yes. I, too, have...
bra experience.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.994
-I barely speak to my father.
-My father's dead.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.463
Damn it.
I know.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.599
The only reason I have
the strength to go on is my son.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.000
Right.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.103
Because
he's the only grade-skipper

01:09.203 --> 01:12.005
in the history of
Abraham Lincoln Middle School.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.474
Oh, wait.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.143
That's my son.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.644
Sorry.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.812
My youngest son.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.348
I have three.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.583
I know
you only have the one.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.256
Well, he's very handy
around the house.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.857
He changes
all the light bulbs.

01:29.957 --> 01:33.161
O-Our fixtures are on the walls,
and t-that's what he's doing.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.195
Mm.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.430
Oh, look at them,
hitting it off.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.499
Why didn't we do this
earlier?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.469
Hey, should we take
a joint family road trip
to the Grand Canyon?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.637
I'll make us a mixtape
for the drive.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.306
Yeah.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.541
**

01:47.641 --> 01:48.842
* Fresh off the boat

01:48.942 --> 01:50.344
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:50.444 --> 01:52.780
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:52.880 --> 01:54.114
* Fresh off the boat

01:54.215 --> 01:56.384
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:56.484 --> 01:57.818
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:57.918 --> 02:00.854
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:02.022 --> 02:03.056
MAN: Save the whales!

02:03.157 --> 02:04.192
I love whales,

02:04.292 --> 02:05.793
but how is signing a petition
going to help?

02:05.893 --> 02:07.828
Yeah, where are they gonna
mail it

02:07.928 --> 02:09.062
Ha.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.501
A pedophile?

02:17.871 --> 02:20.073
BOTH: The hell?!

02:20.174 --> 02:21.842
Explain yourself.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.076
One time!

02:23.177 --> 02:25.313
I-I thought it'd be fun
to dress up one time.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.682
Oh, thank God.
For a second, I thought
you followed me to Miami.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.318
What is the meaning
of this?

02:30.418 --> 02:33.521
It's a new
positive-reinforcement program
we just started.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.723
It rewards one student
every month.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.059
It's January, so there's
only been one recipient --
Stacy Cooper.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.928
Stacy Cooper?!

02:41.028 --> 02:43.264
She's a "B" student
and takes two lunches.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.533
It's about more
than just grades, Evan.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.535
It's also
who's the most well-rounded

02:47.635 --> 02:49.603
and engaged
in our school community.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.405
Stacy got
the cheerleaders

02:51.505 --> 02:53.841
to start cheering
for girl sports.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.878
I see I've got
some work to do.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.547
Mommy,
brainstorm in the car?

02:59.647 --> 03:02.883
**

03:02.983 --> 03:07.054
Oh, and I also don't like
how your new secretary is a man.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.723
**

03:09.823 --> 03:11.392
Oh, excuse me.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.060
Is Kenny Rogers
coming in today?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.762
We want to
take a picture with him.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.096
No, he isn't,

03:16.196 --> 03:17.565
but you can
take a picture with me.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.132
I actually
started Cattleman's.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.401
Oh.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.702
No, thank you.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.038
We'll just buy a Kenny hat
or a bolo tie or a guitar pick.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.474
We actually don't sell
any of that.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.610
Then what am I even doing
in this hellhole?!

03:29.710 --> 03:30.644
Come on, James!

03:30.744 --> 03:32.079
I told you
we should've called ahead!

03:32.179 --> 03:33.247
Ugh!

03:33.347 --> 03:36.083
I'm loving the mouthfeel
of this bison burger.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.551
So juicy.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.987
I heard Kenny created it
to nurse his sick
mother back to health.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.121
I put bison on the menu,

03:41.221 --> 03:43.424
and let me tell you,
it was an uphill battle.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.561
I hear Kenny strangled
that bear with his own hands.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.600
If I were you,
I'd wash your bumper.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.235
You know I'm not one
to compliment children,

03:55.336 --> 03:56.604
but that's a good idea.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.639
Student of the Month,
here I come.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.809
**

04:04.578 --> 04:06.480
How do you say "booty shorts"
in French?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.618
Is it called "French kissing"
over there

04:10.718 --> 04:11.685
or "home kissing"?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.323
Doesn't anyone care
where Jacqueline is?

04:15.423 --> 04:17.991
Are you guys going to Sara's
birthday party on Saturday?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.461
Cherry tomatoes make
a good party snack.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.530
Sign up for my new
Student Garden Program.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.164
Why is your corn
hairy?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.700
Because I haven't
shucked it yet.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.337
Real corn is not
niblets in a can.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.539
Sorry to blow your mind!

04:31.639 --> 04:34.942
What do you think of the theme
"A Night to Remember"?

04:35.042 --> 04:36.944
Did you guys see
what Pacey did to Joey

04:37.044 --> 04:38.178
last night
on "Dawson's"?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.880
We've been here
for two hours,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.316
and we still don't have a theme
for the Spring Fling.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.485
I only hope a boy
kisses me at the dance

04:44.585 --> 04:45.819
like Dawson
kissed Joey.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.188
There won't be a dance
if we don't plan one.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.723
I'm so Team Dawson!
I'm so Team Pacey!

04:49.823 --> 04:50.824
I'm Team Shut Up!

04:50.924 --> 04:53.961
My eyes!
Monique, your eyes!

04:56.797 --> 04:57.865
Hey!

04:57.965 --> 04:59.299
So,
remember at dinner,

04:59.400 --> 05:02.370
when I told Max I knew
how to unhook a bra?

05:02.470 --> 05:03.637
I lied. I don't.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.738
I don't, either.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.240
Could you tell I was lying?
Yes.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.176
We need to
figure this out.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.344
Max is in my grade,

05:10.444 --> 05:12.846
and he's already taken off
like 40 bras.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.516
We just need to find
a bra and practice.
How hard could it be?

05:15.616 --> 05:17.317
Where are we gonna
find a bra?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.153
How does Grandma
get her bras up there?

05:20.253 --> 05:21.355
Mm.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.558
-Oh. That's what that's for.
-Hmm.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.661
**

05:27.761 --> 05:29.162
EVAN:
I'm sorry I lost my temper

05:29.262 --> 05:31.198
and threw glitter
at those girls.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.232
It won't happen again.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.034
Well,
that is good to hear.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.903
But I don't need
counseling.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.439
Don't think of this
as counseling, Evan.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.741
Think of this
as talking.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.376
This is a safe space,
okay,

05:42.476 --> 05:44.378
where we can throw glitter
at each other --

05:44.478 --> 05:45.413
verbally.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.516
Mr. Tim...
if you need someone to help,

05:48.616 --> 05:49.850
talk to the girl
in my class

05:49.950 --> 05:52.352
who turns her breath spray
into a flamethrower.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.422
Ohh! We can
discuss Becky --

05:54.522 --> 05:57.224
I mean, whichever student
that is -- later.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.461
But how about those girls
on the dance committee?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.262
I already said
it was an accident.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.197
Well, why do you think
you reacted that way?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.534
Because they're so stupid
and unfocused!

06:06.634 --> 06:09.136
And it made me feel
so stressed and overwhelmed!

06:09.236 --> 06:10.704
**

06:10.804 --> 06:12.272
Whoa.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.575
Saying that out loud
actually felt pretty good.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.910
Welcome to the process,
Evan.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.616
Hey, buddy. Just working
on our road trip mixtape.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.419
I know this is controversial --
hear me out.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.420
"I'm Too Sexy".

06:26.520 --> 06:28.155
We've been driving
all night,

06:28.255 --> 06:30.157
flat for miles,
nothing to look at.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.660
Then boom!
Right Said Fred.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.996
Just as we ease into El Paso,
we blast it!

06:36.096 --> 06:38.432
Love it. Um, can I talk to you
about something?

06:38.532 --> 06:39.767
Oh. Yeah, sure.

06:39.867 --> 06:43.270
Everywhere I turn, people are
talking about Kenny Rogers.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.838
To be honest,
I'm feeling a little invisible

06:44.938 --> 06:46.607
in my own restaurant.
Oh, no.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.009
I was looking at the menu,
and it got me thinking --

06:49.109 --> 06:51.344
Michael Bolton's Brownie Bomb
is still on there.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.846
I want my name
on a menu item.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.416
I want to put Louis Huang's
Five Alarm Chili on the menu.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.654
I'm...going to
have to agree to...

07:00.754 --> 07:02.923
agree with you.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.594
Pshew-pshew-pshew!

07:06.694 --> 07:07.961
Oh!
Pshew-pshew-pshew-pshew!

07:08.061 --> 07:09.262
BOTH:
Pshew-pshew-pshew!

07:11.298 --> 07:12.933
Ohhh.

07:13.033 --> 07:16.269
He reminds me
of an old boss I had.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.641
Oh, boy.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.709
Jessica!

07:21.809 --> 07:24.111
So nice to see you.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.946
Hello, Amy.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.015
It's so nice
to see you.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.683
Dinner was so fun
the other night.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.184
So fun!

07:31.284 --> 07:32.686
We must do it again.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.021
Absolutely.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.825
I would love to cook you
a traditional Taiwanese meal.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.192
Nonsense!

07:39.292 --> 07:42.195
I would like to whip up
a traditional Bengalese meal.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.731
You said
you were from Tampa.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.667
My heart is Bengali.
I did my mission there.

07:46.767 --> 07:50.003
It didn't go so well,
but the food was unbelievable.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.805
Mm.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.675
Evan,
did you tell Mrs. Chestnut

07:54.775 --> 07:57.010
about being up
for Student of the Month?

07:58.278 --> 07:59.513
Oh. I wanted to talk to you
about that.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.349
And I would love to hear
about it, but I'm late --

08:02.449 --> 08:03.984
to give blood.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.687
Mr. Tim and I think
it's best to push "Pause"
on Student of the Month.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.722
What? Wait.
Who's Mr. Tim?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.090
My school counselor.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.893
I'm seeing him once a week
to manage my stress levels.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.194
Counselor?

08:14.294 --> 08:17.731
Ohhh. That's a school word
for "therapist".

08:18.832 --> 08:20.033
Aww.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.502
And he was supposed to be
the best of your three, right?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.605
(inhales sharply,
sighs)

08:26.607 --> 08:28.876
You dropped something.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.882
Dragon breath.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.117
I did not
give consent!

08:37.217 --> 08:38.552
I'm sorry?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.054
There was no form.
I filled out nothing.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.557
You can't just
counselor-therapy my son.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.726
Keep your witch doctor fingers
out of Evan's brain.

08:45.826 --> 08:49.029
Becky, I'm sorry
to cut our time short,

08:49.129 --> 08:50.598
but I need to talk
to this lady.

08:50.698 --> 08:54.201
Remember to fight the urge
to light things on fire.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.269
Okay.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.408
You hypnotized my son.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.644
He was on track to be
Student of the Month,

09:03.744 --> 09:06.647
and you waved your pocket watch
in front of his face,

09:06.747 --> 09:07.915
and now he's not.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.251
Mrs. Huang, Evan came
to his own conclusion

09:11.351 --> 09:12.419
about
Student of the Month.

09:12.519 --> 09:15.088
There are nine months
in the school year, after all.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.157
His narrative
doesn't have to be so linear.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.060
Ugh. Again
with the hippie talk.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.328
You know, sometimes,

09:21.428 --> 09:24.097
parents confuse their own
ambition for their child's.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.633
That's not
what this is.

09:25.733 --> 09:29.803
I have a son with no ambition.
I know what that looks like.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.840
Okay.
Got it on the pillow.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.675
We should take a break.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.180
Evan has always
pushed himself.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.816
He doesn't need people like you
telling him what to do.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.685
Oh, I don't tell him
what to do.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.454
I provide
a safe, judgment-free space

09:47.554 --> 09:49.122
for Evan
to share his feelings.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.590
He seems to be responding
very well.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.294
Don't act like you know my son
better than I do.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.963
Oh, it's not my job
to know Evan.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.132
It's my job
to help Evan know Evan.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.602
Okay, Mr. Tim,
this is over.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.806
If anyone's going to
talk to my son, it's me!

10:05.906 --> 10:08.175
I'm not entrusting him
to some fake doctor

10:08.275 --> 10:10.310
who lets kids call him
by his first name!

10:10.410 --> 10:12.846
My name is actually
Richard Tim.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.147
Ugh!

10:14.247 --> 10:16.216
**

10:16.316 --> 10:17.851
LOUIS: Good afternoon.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.689
I'm Louis Huang, creator of
Louis Huang's Five Alarm Chili,

10:21.789 --> 10:24.224
which you'll find on the
left-hand corner of your menus.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.993
Four bowls?

10:26.093 --> 10:28.361
Mm...not really
in the mood for chili.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.664
It's like
89 degrees outside.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.800
It, uh,
almost won an award, you know.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.134
Do you guys
do po' boys?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.335
No, we don't.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.503
Okay, um...

10:36.603 --> 10:39.072
Look, I never do this,
but order the chili.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.808
Alright? just order it.

10:40.908 --> 10:44.011
There might be
a little pageantry if you do.
-We don't want chili.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.213
Free chili, alright?
Sample it.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.816
Free bowl for the table,
four spoons, four smiles.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.183
We're gonna go.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.584
Oh, come on.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.822
Ohhhhhh, bud.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.724
Don't let this
get you down.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.591
All it takes is
one person to say "yes",

10:58.692 --> 11:00.761
and then
those floodgates will open --

11:00.861 --> 11:02.863
like Willy Wonka's
chocolate river,
except with chili

11:02.963 --> 11:06.233
and you riding a spoon boat
on the way to your goals.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.901
**

11:12.740 --> 11:14.341
-Hello, Evan.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.608
I spoke with Mr. Tim.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.178
He encouraged us to do
home-counseling therapy.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.680
You could talk to me
the same way you talk to him --

11:20.781 --> 11:22.549
directly,
like mother and son.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.451
Okay.
Start.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.619
Can I sit down?

11:27.554 --> 11:29.356
Yes, you can sit down.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.029
And begin.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.698
How are you feeling today --
not normal or normal?

11:38.799 --> 11:41.134
I...think I'm normal?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.136
Good. This is working.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.872
Now I'm gonna
show you something,

11:44.972 --> 11:47.640
and you tell me
how it makes you feel.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.612
-The Coopers have too many
bumper stickers on their car.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.947
They won't miss it.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.383
Mr. Tim said
you don't want this anymore.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.885
It's not
that I don't want it,

11:57.985 --> 11:59.586
but Mr. Tim and I agree

11:59.686 --> 12:00.988
that it doesn't need
to be right now.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.423
What's the difference
between now and later?

12:03.523 --> 12:05.258
If you're gonna put in
the effort later,

12:05.358 --> 12:06.894
why not put in
the effort now?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.263
Yeah. I guess
that kind of makes sense.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.065
Think about
your life plan.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.934
You still want to be
doctor/president?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.468
Yes. Of course.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.637
Oh, you're not gonna
become doctor/president

12:17.737 --> 12:20.440
by doing tomorrow
what you could do today.

12:22.275 --> 12:26.179
**

12:30.750 --> 12:31.651
You're right.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.153
Thank you for
chopping down that tree

12:33.253 --> 12:35.122
so I can see the forest
clearly.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.957
My ax is love.

12:37.057 --> 12:41.128
**

12:41.228 --> 12:44.264
My hand
is starting to cramp.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.967
Suck it up, bro!
It's only been an hour!

12:47.067 --> 12:48.368
I have
the first two hooks undone,

12:48.468 --> 12:49.636
but I still have
two to go.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.271
I feel my pillow girl
losing interest.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.842
You know what?
Move over. My turn.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.480
I got it!

13:02.115 --> 13:03.050
Damn, son!

13:03.150 --> 13:04.617
I just re-hooked
the ones you undid.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.187
She's more bra'd up
than when I started.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.622
**

13:09.722 --> 13:11.191
Not a single person
ordered my chili.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.861
Matthew tried to say it was
because it was too hot outside,

13:13.961 --> 13:15.362
but meanwhile, we sold out
of the clam chowder,

13:15.462 --> 13:16.696
so I know it's not that.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.665
That sounds like
it's very important to you.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.068
Evan, how was your day?
Take us up.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.037
Great! I'm back on track
for Student of the Month.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.340
I convinced the French club to
put on a production of "Les Mis"

13:27.440 --> 13:29.542
that we can pay for
with my Student Garden profits.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.346
Also, we came up with
a theme for the dance --
"Arabian Nights".

13:33.446 --> 13:36.816
And Monique has forgiven me
for almost blinding her.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.055
Plus, I'm organizing a bake sale
for the homeless...

13:43.456 --> 13:45.592
...and I'm dealing
with Deonte,

13:45.692 --> 13:47.360
who doesn't know
a scone from a muffin...

13:47.460 --> 13:49.229
Hey, are you okay?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.731
...Tammy, who has never
even heard of an eclair.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.534
Eclairs are just...
a choux pastry...

13:57.404 --> 13:59.272
What?!
GRANDMA: Evan!

14:01.841 --> 14:03.010
Oh, yeah.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.744
Breathe. Breathe.
Breathe in there.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.779
Just relax.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.021
**

14:16.957 --> 14:18.391
How you feeling?

14:18.491 --> 14:20.727
Fine. I don't know
what happened.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.396
You just rest.
I'm glad you're okay.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.432
Is he okay?!

14:25.532 --> 14:27.100
I think I pushed him too hard.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.036
You've always
pushed him hard.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.438
And like that counselor said
at school, Evan pushes himself.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.940
Well, then,
what's changed?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.241
Why does he suddenly
need to breathe

14:34.341 --> 14:35.875
into my authentic
Chanel purse?

14:35.976 --> 14:38.211
Maybe we took him out
of Dr. Tim's sessions too soon.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.081
He's not a doctor.
He's a mister.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.084
And he's only known Evan
for five minutes.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.485
What kind of a mother
am I

14:45.585 --> 14:47.754
if a stranger can help my son
better than I can?

14:47.854 --> 14:49.289
You're a great mother.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.324
But maybe a little extra help
isn't a bad thing.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.826
But therapy?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.629
You want to pay to have our son
whine to a stranger?

14:56.729 --> 14:59.332
I don't know anyone
who's ever done therapy.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.134
I never did, no one
in my family ever did.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.636
Really? You think
your sister's not in therapy?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.973
Where do you think
Connie goes every Tuesday?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.574
She says she's taking
cooking classes.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.109
Well, if she is,
it's with her therapist.

15:09.209 --> 15:13.413
Look, there is no shame in doing
what's best for our kids.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.982
**

15:17.517 --> 15:20.420
Fine.
I will admit that Evan could
benefit from talking to you.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.457
But I will need a detailed
report on everything he says.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.626
Still not how it works.

15:26.726 --> 15:30.197
I tell my therapist everything,
and nothing leaves that room.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.199
You have a therapist?

15:32.299 --> 15:35.969
That's like a barber going
to a barber to get his haircut.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.505
Well, how do you think
barbers get their hair cut?

15:39.539 --> 15:40.974
Hmm.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.477
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.713
No.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.983
I can tell there's something
you'd like to say.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.486
I thought I was
being supportive

15:53.586 --> 15:56.523
about Evan being
Student of the Month, but...

15:56.623 --> 15:59.526
I think I pushed him
into having a panic attack.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.329
Well, Evan is
a very driven young man.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.531
Maybe with your other sons
you need to be the gas pedal,

16:04.631 --> 16:06.699
but for Evan,
you need to be the brakes.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.805
He's always challenged himself
to be the best student,

16:12.905 --> 16:14.841
and he's always been able
to handle the pressure.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.178
Well, there's more
to grade-skipping
than just academics.

16:18.278 --> 16:21.081
There's -- There's social
hurdles that go along with it.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.883
But Evan's always related well
to older people.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.886
He runs our neighborhood HOA
with an iron fist.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.256
He may be fine
handling himself with adults,

16:29.356 --> 16:33.060
but he has a hard time
relating to his new peers.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.427
Evan is
a very special kid.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.496
I'm gonna give him the tools
he needs to succeed.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.698
Me too.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.001
He's both
of our favorites!

16:42.869 --> 16:44.003
Oh!

16:44.104 --> 16:45.438
That's what
these are for.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.408
I get it now.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.411
**

16:51.511 --> 16:55.748
Here you go, sir --
Louis Huang's Five Alarm Chili.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.050
I didn't order
the chili.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.052
Oh. But it's here now.
Try it.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.254
No, thanks.
I'm waiting on the chowder.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.889
**

17:02.989 --> 17:04.891
I'll try
some chili.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.059
**

17:06.159 --> 17:09.596
I heard about Louis Huang's
famous Five Alarm Chili

17:09.696 --> 17:12.632
back wherever I came from --
in my hometown city.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.805
Well...

17:19.906 --> 17:22.209
...here you go,
weary traveler.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.211
It smells heartwarming.

17:24.311 --> 17:26.246
I can't wait to find out
what Louis Huang put in here.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.280
I'm actually
Louis Huang.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.449
What?!
From the menu?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.483
That's right.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.555
Yep. You can taste
each alarm.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.056
What's in here?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.259
Unfortunately, I can't divulge
my secret recipe.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.128
No, seriously,
what is in this?

17:41.228 --> 17:42.929
Again, family secret.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.233
Oh, God.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.135
Oh, no! He's having
a panic attack!

17:48.235 --> 17:50.837
Who has a knock-off Chanel purse
he can breathe into?

17:50.937 --> 17:53.140
Are there Szechuan peppercorns
in here?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.474
I'm allergic
to Szechuan peppercorns.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.808
But that's
the fourth alarm!

17:55.908 --> 17:56.976
No, don't worry.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.745
I can drive myself home.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.480
No.
I'll be fine.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.648
Oh! Matthew!

18:02.849 --> 18:05.818
You should see it, Louis.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.787
It's beautiful.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.357
(Right Said Fred's
"I'm Too Sexy" plays)
Looks like
we're rolling into El Paso!

18:10.457 --> 18:11.491
Uh-oh!

18:14.427 --> 18:16.963
* I'm too sexy for my shirt

18:17.063 --> 18:18.631
* Too sexy for my shirt

18:18.731 --> 18:20.433
* So sexy, it hurts
LOUIS: Matthew!

18:20.533 --> 18:21.434
Matthew!

18:21.534 --> 18:22.769
Matthew,
can you hear me?!

18:24.737 --> 18:26.206
W--
How long was I out?

18:26.306 --> 18:28.708
Wait.
Who won the X Games?

18:29.542 --> 18:32.044
I don't know.
Who won the X Games?

18:32.145 --> 18:35.014
I don't know why
this matters to me.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.849
It's not like
I know this woman,

18:36.949 --> 18:39.118
but for some reason,
she gets under my skin.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.189
It sounds like
there's a lot to unpack here

18:42.289 --> 18:44.957
with your husband's
partner's wife,

18:45.057 --> 18:47.360
but, uh,
if we're going to talk,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.229
it really needs
to be about Evan.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.664
Okay.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.534
How much is counseling for Evan
going to cost me?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.669
I do have AAA,
if there's a discount.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.471
There's no charge.
It's free.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.506
Free?

18:59.606 --> 19:00.807
Yes -- free.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.576
It's a service provided by
Abraham Lincoln Middle School.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.248
Talk to him.
It's free.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.251
As helpful as you think
you're being, Mrs. Huang,

19:11.351 --> 19:13.720
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave now.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.223
Okay, I'll go.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.558
I'm just gonna leave
my authentic Chanel purse

19:18.658 --> 19:20.660
here for safekeeping.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.896
Uh...

19:23.996 --> 19:26.165
I'm going to need you to take
your tape recorder with you.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.167
It's against the rules
and very loud.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.869
Nice.

19:29.969 --> 19:34.374
Oh, Evan, you are in good hands
with this man.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.276
Goodbye.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.377
Uh...uh...

19:37.477 --> 19:39.579
you'll be needing
your microphone, too.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.348
Oh!

19:41.448 --> 19:43.783
Oh!
Doesn't miss a thing!

19:43.883 --> 19:47.186
**

19:47.287 --> 19:48.688
Is there
a child lock

19:48.788 --> 19:50.857
or some sort of safety switch
we're not seeing?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.725
You know what?

19:52.825 --> 19:53.926
It's not us.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.962
It's the pillow!

19:56.062 --> 19:58.698
We need something
with more...structure.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.537
Why don't they
make these with Velcro?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.773
Maybe we need
to work together.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.109
Come on, Mrs. Claus.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.778
How do women do this
on themselves?

20:11.878 --> 20:14.947
I don't know, but I got a new
mad respect for the ladies.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.920
Well, I know
what I'll be talking about

20:21.020 --> 20:22.489
with Mr. Tim this week.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.129
And Evan's relating more
to his peers.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.298
He's even
thinking of going

20:31.398 --> 20:32.765
to see "The Wedding Singer"
with Monique,

20:32.865 --> 20:35.935
which is big for him,
and it's all thanks to therapy.

20:36.035 --> 20:39.138
Oh. So you're...
telling people about that now?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.407
So brave.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.509
Smart of you
to get out in front of that.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.644
He's getting the tools
he needs to succeed,

20:44.744 --> 20:46.313
and I support that.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.481
You know who else
is in therapy?
No.

20:48.581 --> 20:53.085
Oprah, Jane Fonda,
Lee Iacocca, James Brown.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.488
Wait
But he seems so together.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.024
Mm. He only says
he feels good.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.426
Thank you
for almost dying

20:59.526 --> 21:01.160
for the chili
that bears my name.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.529
Sorry it was a bust.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.665
I'll take a bowl of the
Louis Huang Five Alarm Chili.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.799
Really?

21:06.899 --> 21:09.168
It's supposed to be,
like, super spicy.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.437
I mean, crazy spicy.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.305
I mean, so many people I know
want to try it.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.640
People are talking
about my chili!

21:13.740 --> 21:15.207
Who's invisible now?

21:15.308 --> 21:17.477
Apparently, some four-eyed
piece of cream cheese

21:17.577 --> 21:19.346
tried it
and could not handle it.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.980
They had to put him
in the hospital.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.148
My chili's on the map!

21:22.248 --> 21:23.683
I'm gonna get
my chow bell.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.519
"Piece of cream cheese"?

21:29.356 --> 21:31.691
