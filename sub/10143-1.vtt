05:52.028 --> 05:54.429
Captain, this was your
operation. What went wrong?

05:54.463 --> 05:57.313
We committed too fast,
with inadequate surveillance

05:57.338 --> 05:58.538
of the target location...

05:58.566 --> 06:01.168
And ineffective
perimeter security.

06:01.203 --> 06:02.882
Has the rash
cooled, Captain?

06:02.883 --> 06:04.729
All due respect Major, when
was the last time you stepped

06:04.754 --> 06:05.840
out from behind a desk?

06:05.841 --> 06:07.208
Stonebridge.

06:08.710 --> 06:11.846
Sinclair's right.
It was rash.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.183
Captain, anything
else to add?

06:15.218 --> 06:16.718
Our intel was good.
Mmm-hmm.

06:16.753 --> 06:19.454
Porter was there. We had a
small window of opportunity...

06:19.489 --> 06:21.857
If we'd waited any
longer then we would've...

06:21.892 --> 06:23.807
Porter would still have
been gone, and maybe one of

06:23.832 --> 06:25.368
our best men would be alive.

06:27.831 --> 06:29.798
We analyzed
the map of Delhi

06:29.823 --> 06:31.541
and the mobile phone
that you recovered.

06:31.835 --> 06:34.971
Several calls were logged on
throwaway phones, in India, but...

06:35.005 --> 06:36.790
None of it is
actionable intel.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.518
Well, if Latif's men are
calling Delhi,

06:38.543 --> 06:39.942
they may well
be planning something there.

06:39.943 --> 06:41.644
Possibly "Project Dawn."

06:41.678 --> 06:43.698
True. But we still
don't know

06:43.723 --> 06:45.123
what "Project Dawn,"
is yet, do we?

06:45.148 --> 06:47.249
That's what Porter was
supposed to find out.

06:47.283 --> 06:49.151
All we know...

06:49.185 --> 06:51.397
Is that Latif has vowed to
launch a devastating attack

06:51.422 --> 06:53.022
on British and
American citizens.

06:53.123 --> 06:54.659
And as of now, I have

06:54.684 --> 06:57.211
to report to the MOD
that we have nothing.

06:59.196 --> 07:01.163
We cannot afford
any more mistakes.

07:01.198 --> 07:04.266
I cannot afford any more
mistakes. Understood?

07:04.301 --> 07:06.402
- Colonel.
- Okay.

07:06.437 --> 07:07.770
Thank you, Kate.

07:11.341 --> 07:13.476
I need you to
locate this man.

07:13.510 --> 07:18.347
His name is Damien
Scott, ex-Delta Force.

07:23.253 --> 07:25.321
Colonel. Major.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.669
What the fuck?

07:42.539 --> 07:43.873
Whoo.

07:43.907 --> 07:45.675
Don't you knock?

07:45.709 --> 07:47.777
I own this place.

07:47.811 --> 07:51.114
You own everything
in this shithole, Ong.

07:51.148 --> 07:54.250
Now, what do you want?

07:54.284 --> 07:57.219
I have a lot of money
riding on this fight.

07:57.254 --> 07:59.722
You tell Igor to lay
off the nose, huh?

07:59.756 --> 08:02.591
All right, where's
my ringgit?

08:02.626 --> 08:05.094
You'll be paid. After.

08:05.129 --> 08:07.964
Fuckin' asshole.

08:09.299 --> 08:12.901
You win for
Treena, Scott?

08:12.936 --> 08:17.406
Not this time, honey.
Not this time.

08:17.440 --> 08:21.009
Ong, lay
off the nose, huh?

08:21.044 --> 08:23.544
Yeah, fuck you too.

08:26.415 --> 08:28.382
Fuck!

08:28.417 --> 08:30.117
Lay off the fuckin' nose!

08:33.453 --> 08:36.121
Igor!

08:39.025 --> 08:40.393
Ha!

09:05.722 --> 09:06.922
Get some water.

09:10.627 --> 09:14.329
What the fuck, Ong?
I said, "Not the nose."

09:17.500 --> 09:20.002
Come on, Scott!

09:26.442 --> 09:28.510
Scott! Scott!

09:28.545 --> 09:30.379
Fight!

09:30.413 --> 09:31.747
Fuck!

09:51.669 --> 09:53.670
Ahhh!

09:55.840 --> 09:57.374
Come on, Igor!

09:59.877 --> 10:02.512
Get up!

10:02.547 --> 10:04.314
Yeah!

10:04.348 --> 10:05.548
Get up!

10:06.550 --> 10:08.251
Igor!

10:09.420 --> 10:10.820
Woo-hoo!

10:10.854 --> 10:12.789
Ah, shit!

10:14.658 --> 10:15.992
Scott!

10:25.204 --> 10:28.473
Hi, Scott!
Hey, honey.

10:33.113 --> 10:35.214
Hey, sexy.
Hey.

10:51.866 --> 10:54.233
Not a bad fight
back there.

10:54.268 --> 10:56.402
Once you decided
to fight, that is.

10:58.739 --> 11:03.075
Really? So...
Who you with?

11:03.109 --> 11:05.710
SAS, or... SBS?

11:05.744 --> 11:08.146
Section 20. High-risk,
priority targets.

11:08.180 --> 11:11.948
Oh, wow. You're such hot
shit, what are you doing here?

11:11.983 --> 11:14.184
John Porter.

11:14.219 --> 11:15.619
What about him?

11:15.653 --> 11:18.922
He was undercover in Pakistan
looking for a man named Latif.

11:18.956 --> 11:20.456
Latif found Porter instead.

11:20.491 --> 11:22.124
What's that got
to do with me?

11:22.159 --> 11:24.460
You and Porter were the only
soldiers ever to see Latif.

11:24.494 --> 11:25.861
Back in 2002.

11:25.896 --> 11:28.531
You must be really
desperate, buddy.

11:28.566 --> 11:31.067
There's a HERC waiting
to take us back to London.

11:31.102 --> 11:33.170
Since you're packing
your bags anyway.

11:33.204 --> 11:35.472
Ong's looking for you!
Yeah, I know.

11:35.507 --> 11:39.109
He's very angry!
I know.

11:39.144 --> 11:40.478
How much?

11:40.512 --> 11:42.113
How much?

11:42.147 --> 11:43.681
Yeah, you want my help
finding Porter,

11:43.706 --> 11:46.841
I want cash.
And a lot of it.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.589
I thought you and
Porter were mates.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.057
Yeah. We were.

11:53.091 --> 11:56.360
But now, as you can
see, I'm retired.

11:56.394 --> 11:58.246
Dishonorably discharged,

11:58.271 --> 12:00.093
on the eve of Operation
Iraqi Freedom.

12:00.098 --> 12:01.732
Not even the PMCs
will touch you.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.934
Yeah. That's right.

12:03.969 --> 12:06.804
So, if you don't want to pay me,
well, you can go fuck yourself.

12:06.838 --> 12:08.238
You're not going to leave me!

12:08.273 --> 12:10.641
Oh, just for a couple
of days, honey.

12:10.676 --> 12:12.210
Here, thanks,
thanks, honey.

12:12.244 --> 12:14.613
You'll get paid.
Yeah?

12:14.647 --> 12:16.147
More than you're worth.

12:16.181 --> 12:18.250
Yeah. What's
your name?

12:18.284 --> 12:19.351
Stonebridge.

12:19.385 --> 12:22.688
Okay, Stonehenge.
Time to go.

12:22.722 --> 12:24.891
Scott, please! How
will I find you?

12:24.925 --> 12:27.294
I'll friend you on
Facebook, honey.

12:27.328 --> 12:30.030
Um, dude. Not that way.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.400
Trust me.

12:48.418 --> 12:52.621
Uh... Hold that, buddy.
Move over there.

12:55.825 --> 12:56.991
Oh!

13:05.300 --> 13:06.500
Ahhh!

13:10.071 --> 13:12.071
Yeah!

13:12.106 --> 13:13.506
Can we go now?

13:13.540 --> 13:15.241
I'm driving.

13:15.308 --> 13:17.042
Nice hit, buddy.

13:18.912 --> 13:20.747
Let's go.
Come on, Come on.

13:22.683 --> 13:24.450
Drive, drive,
drive. Come on. Come on.

13:35.129 --> 13:38.865
Colonel, this is Damien.
Oh, Damien Scott.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.837
Colonel Grant. Commanding
officer of Section 20.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.511
This is Major Oliver Sinclair.

13:43.738 --> 13:45.206
Captain Kate Marshall.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.808
Hello.
Captain. A pleasure.

13:47.843 --> 13:49.599
This is all very impressive,

13:49.624 --> 13:52.647
but, um, I've never actually
heard of Section 20.

13:52.715 --> 13:55.116
No, of course not.
Officially, we don't exist.

13:55.151 --> 13:57.819
Kate, I understand you and

13:57.844 --> 14:00.536
Porter worked closely with
Latif in Afghanistan.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.128
It was taken 10 years
ago in Peshawar.

14:06.162 --> 14:07.617
It's the only
photo we have.

14:07.621 --> 14:08.943
This guy's former ISI.

14:08.968 --> 14:11.106
You're telling me that no
one in Pakistan can ID him?

14:11.201 --> 14:13.369
No one alive. Latif
made sure of that.

14:13.403 --> 14:14.803
So, if you could...

14:14.838 --> 14:16.338
Take a look at the
surveillance photos...

14:16.372 --> 14:19.041
Help us identify what he
looks like now, then, uh...

14:19.075 --> 14:21.576
We have a chance to
locate and rescue Porter.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.912
Sure, but, uh, not
until I get paid.

14:26.581 --> 14:29.216
Colonel, It's Porter.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.650
Big screen.

14:30.685 --> 14:33.119
Contact GCHQ. I want
this Website monitored now.

14:33.153 --> 14:34.220
Yes, sir.

14:34.254 --> 14:35.588
They're transmitting live.

14:35.622 --> 14:37.089
- Track IP now.
- Tracking IP.

14:42.696 --> 14:44.764
No effort has been
made to free the brothers...

14:44.798 --> 14:47.433
Being held by the
American and British dogs.

14:47.467 --> 14:50.803
You cowards. You make
me fucking laugh!

14:50.837 --> 14:52.571
Ahhh!

14:54.975 --> 14:58.211
<i>Instead, the blood of</i>
<i>other martyrs has been...</i>

14:58.245 --> 14:59.846

Why don't you just get on with it,

15:03.717 --> 15:05.351
Ahhh!

15:06.987 --> 15:09.021

lock in three minutes.

15:09.056 --> 15:13.259

15:13.293 --> 15:15.194
God, no.

15:15.229 --> 15:16.396
Blood.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.826
One more.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.462
Thanks.

15:58.408 --> 15:59.842
To John.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.443
To John.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.446
R-I-P, buddy.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.586
Same again.

16:25.565 --> 16:27.032
Thanks.

16:27.067 --> 16:32.103
It's good of you to come.
Considering it's an unpaid gig.

16:34.140 --> 16:39.443
Yeah, well. He was
a damn good soldier.

16:40.612 --> 16:42.146
at, he was.

16:43.982 --> 16:46.952
I just didn't expect
him to die this way.

16:48.054 --> 16:50.255
How do you mean?

16:50.290 --> 16:54.860
Well, you knew John. His
mantra was, "Never give up."

16:54.895 --> 16:56.729
No matter what.

16:56.763 --> 16:58.398
Yeah.

17:01.668 --> 17:04.503
Sometimes you don't
have a choice.

17:04.538 --> 17:06.005
True.

17:08.575 --> 17:11.644
I just thought,
maybe he'd...

17:11.679 --> 17:16.449
What? Put up
more of a fight?

17:20.619 --> 17:21.819
Yeah.

17:35.134 --> 17:37.769
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>get on with it?</i>

17:37.804 --> 17:41.072

17:45.278 --> 17:47.657
<i>Rescue me... Why don't</i>
<i>you just get on with it,</i>

18:17.174 --> 18:19.676
Holy shit.

18:25.784 --> 18:28.819
All right, and then...
walks in, says, "What's the problem?"

18:28.854 --> 18:32.257
He looks. Sees he's butt-naked
from the waist down.

18:35.195 --> 18:36.562
Hey, luv. Have a nice run?

18:36.596 --> 18:38.364
Hey, buddy.

18:38.398 --> 18:40.132
Nice tights.

18:41.101 --> 18:42.835
Can I have a word?

18:42.869 --> 18:44.970
Yeah.

18:45.004 --> 18:47.063
Damien, why don't you stay
for breakfast?

18:47.088 --> 18:49.165
I can make a full English,
Mike's favorite.

18:50.709 --> 18:52.643
Uh, no, thanks.

18:58.483 --> 19:00.685
I should break
your fucking neck.

19:00.719 --> 19:02.520
Easy, buddy.
Hmm?

19:02.555 --> 19:05.123
This is my
home. My home.

19:05.158 --> 19:08.894
I know. It's a great
one, too. Kerry's a great girl.

19:08.929 --> 19:10.930
How'd you find me?

19:10.964 --> 19:12.632
I, uh...
Thank you.

19:12.666 --> 19:14.601
Trace my mobile?

19:14.635 --> 19:16.703
You're not so
hard to find.

19:16.737 --> 19:20.640
I got something to show
you. Where's your laptop?

19:20.674 --> 19:22.800
According to Scott,

19:22.825 --> 19:24.351
when him and Porter
entered Afghanistan...

19:24.445 --> 19:27.180
They used to work with a lot of
locals they couldn't always trust.

19:27.214 --> 19:29.482
To pass messages back
and forth to each other...

19:29.516 --> 19:32.451
They came up with a simple numerical
code, only they would know.

19:32.485 --> 19:34.519
It's pretty basic.

19:34.554 --> 19:36.621
You switch each sequential
number of the alphabet...

19:36.656 --> 19:38.589
With Scott and Porter's
new number system.

19:38.624 --> 19:43.928
And, "P-R-I-C-K-S"
becomes "L-O-T-U-S-H."

19:43.963 --> 19:45.630
Lotus H.
You can't be serious.

19:45.664 --> 19:46.998
What's "Lotus H?"

19:47.033 --> 19:49.801
It could be one in a million things.
Including this.

19:49.835 --> 19:52.937
The Royal Lotus
Hotel, in Delhi.

19:52.972 --> 19:55.073
Shit, Mike. You're
clutching at straws.

19:55.107 --> 19:57.209
That guy would do
anything to get paid.

19:57.243 --> 19:59.679
Bear with me. There was
one other coded word

19:59.704 --> 20:01.104
in Porter's first outburst.

20:01.227 --> 20:02.828
<i>British dogs...</i>

20:02.853 --> 20:05.629
<i>Cowards, you make</i>
<i>me fucking laugh!</i>

20:08.088 --> 20:11.023
Deciphered it becomes...

20:12.392 --> 20:14.527
P-Dawn.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.663
"Project Dawn."
Right.

20:16.697 --> 20:18.865
Now, "Lotus H" could
have been a lucky guess.

20:18.900 --> 20:21.668
But, there's no possible way, Scott
could have known about "Project Dawn."

20:21.703 --> 20:23.437
Or, its significance to us.

20:24.940 --> 20:28.544
Porter died trying to tell us what
he'd found out about Latif.

20:31.248 --> 20:32.431
All right, everyone go home.

20:32.456 --> 20:35.167
Take a shower, kiss your
partner, feed your dog.

20:37.855 --> 20:39.189
All set, Sergeant.

20:39.223 --> 20:41.391
Major, let's prepare the crib.

20:41.425 --> 20:44.860
I want everyone assembled
at RAF Lakenheath by 1900.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.261
We're re-locating to Delhi.

20:46.295 --> 20:49.064
Hey. Today's the 15th.

20:49.089 --> 20:51.041
You know how much
I want this baby.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.967
Darling, I'm
late as it is.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.169
Are you going to
walk out on this?

21:01.009 --> 21:04.779
Michael. We'll
need to take him.

21:04.813 --> 21:07.582
I know, but he
was Delta Force once.

21:07.617 --> 21:10.329
And, if Latif is in Delhi,

21:10.354 --> 21:11.989
then he'll be the one
to recognize him.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.224
Copy that.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.595
I.D.

22:35.540 --> 22:39.977
Okay, the satellite should
be coming up any second now.

22:41.079 --> 22:45.316
Major Ashkani.
Major, please.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.387
Colonel.

22:49.421 --> 22:51.823
- Colonel Grant.
- Welcome to "The Crib."

22:51.857 --> 22:54.626
This is Captain Kate Marshall,
our chief Intel Analyst.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.861
And Major Oliver
Sinclair, my second.

22:56.896 --> 23:00.698
This is Major Ashkani,
Pakistani's ISI's Delhi agent.

23:00.732 --> 23:04.035
Please accept my condolences
for the loss of your soldier.

23:04.069 --> 23:05.770
John Porter was
a valiant man.

23:05.804 --> 23:07.171
Thank you.

23:07.206 --> 23:08.573
I better run.
Excuse me.

23:08.607 --> 23:11.209
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

23:11.243 --> 23:13.779
We have reason to believe
that Latif is here in Delhi.

23:13.813 --> 23:16.181
Latif here? But why?
Mmm-hmm.

23:16.216 --> 23:17.917
We don't know.

23:17.951 --> 23:20.553
That's why we'd like the assistance
from Pakistani intelligence.

23:20.587 --> 23:23.100
Of course, but I must ask

23:23.856 --> 23:25.934
does the Indian government
know you're here?

23:27.661 --> 23:30.363
As you can see, Major, we
like to keep a low profile.

23:34.335 --> 23:35.369
Thanks very much.

23:35.403 --> 23:37.938
There you are,
Mr. Langly.

23:37.973 --> 23:40.240
Thank you,
Mr. Byers.

23:40.274 --> 23:43.176
Your credit card.
Enjoy your stay.

23:44.945 --> 23:49.581
Hey. Rooms are that way.

23:49.616 --> 23:53.718
Yeah, I know. The
bar is this way.

23:53.752 --> 23:55.820
Life's just one long pussy
prowl for you, isn't it?

23:55.854 --> 23:59.056
I'm on
the case, Mr. Byers.

23:59.090 --> 24:01.825
The bar is the first place a good
Muslim would go to blend in.

24:01.860 --> 24:02.891
Hmm.

24:02.916 --> 24:04.340
It's really great to
have you on the team.

24:06.298 --> 24:08.666
<i>Michael, you in?</i>

24:08.701 --> 24:10.668
Yes, I'm in.

24:10.703 --> 24:14.339
What do you see?

24:14.373 --> 24:16.174
Six cameras in total.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.929
Four in the lobby,
one in each corner,

24:17.954 --> 24:19.154
two at the entrance.

24:20.512 --> 24:22.880
I think I found where
to tap into their feed.

24:22.915 --> 24:26.850
Okay, well, I'll be there in
about, about five minutes.

24:26.885 --> 24:28.552
Make it 10!

24:28.586 --> 24:30.420
Better make it 10.

24:37.660 --> 24:40.963
Excuse me. Can I get a
Laphroaig on the rocks, please?

24:40.997 --> 24:42.364
A single or double?

24:42.399 --> 24:46.236
Ah, it depends. How
soon you get off?

24:46.270 --> 24:48.639
Are you hitting on me?

24:48.673 --> 24:50.241
Is it working?

24:51.210 --> 24:52.710
I'll make it a double.

24:52.745 --> 24:53.945
Yep.

25:04.290 --> 25:05.457
Thanks.

25:12.431 --> 25:13.898
This is the Royal
Lotus, isn't it?

25:13.932 --> 25:14.999
Sorry?

25:15.033 --> 25:18.702
This hotel. Is it
the Royal Lotus?

25:18.736 --> 25:21.238
You don't know
where you are?

25:21.272 --> 25:23.741
Not most of the time.

25:23.775 --> 25:26.877
Another lost American.
Yeah.

25:28.847 --> 25:30.815
How about you?

25:30.849 --> 25:32.850
Just a very tired Brit.

25:32.885 --> 25:35.786
Here alone.
Traveling for business.

25:35.820 --> 25:37.521
You're psychic.

25:38.556 --> 25:39.856
Thank you.

25:42.827 --> 25:45.141
Why don't you let me, uh,
buy you another drink, and,

25:45.166 --> 25:46.948
I'll amaze you some more.

25:47.330 --> 25:49.198
No thanks.

25:49.232 --> 25:51.133
I'm just leaving.

26:28.138 --> 26:30.806
That's a really pretty ring.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.076
Why me?

26:34.110 --> 26:36.845
I like you.
You don't know me.

26:36.879 --> 26:39.715
I can tell that
we'd hit it off.

26:41.985 --> 26:46.789
Too bad we'll never find out.

26:49.493 --> 26:50.860
Yeah.

26:54.765 --> 26:56.466
Uh, going down?

26:56.501 --> 26:58.001
Up.

27:00.972 --> 27:02.406
Do you have a picture?

27:02.440 --> 27:03.907
Hang on a sec.

27:07.511 --> 27:09.345
Roger that.

27:09.379 --> 27:11.981
Julia?
<i>Standing by.</i>

27:14.016 --> 27:16.317
Got it. Start
official scans.

27:16.351 --> 27:17.518
Roger.

27:19.955 --> 27:21.812
Surely, you
can't expect to recognize

27:21.837 --> 27:22.857
Latif, based on...

27:22.858 --> 27:26.160
CCTV feeds and a
10-year-old photograph?

27:26.194 --> 27:29.497
Major, we need your help to
identify known associates.

27:29.531 --> 27:32.500
We have a man on the inside
that can identify Latif.

27:32.534 --> 27:34.268
Room Service.

27:35.504 --> 27:36.938
Hey.

27:37.806 --> 27:39.774
You alone?

27:39.808 --> 27:41.209
Uh, yeah.

27:42.912 --> 27:46.882
You know, I don't remember
telling you my room number.

27:46.917 --> 27:49.052
You wrote it on the bill.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.487
Yeah.

27:53.324 --> 27:55.425
You off work already?

27:56.761 --> 27:58.561
I'm on a break.

28:49.747 --> 28:51.213
Thank you.

28:52.915 --> 28:54.983
Kate.
Yeah, I'm here.

28:55.018 --> 28:57.185
Just outside the
entrance. Thanks.

28:57.219 --> 28:58.820
I think we have trouble.

28:58.854 --> 29:00.922
Okay, coming in now.

29:00.956 --> 29:03.758
Hi, it's just a PC.
Thank you, Ma'am.

29:08.331 --> 29:11.100
There, only 10.

29:11.134 --> 29:13.502
<i>Got it? Got it.</i>

29:16.839 --> 29:19.208
May I check your
bag, please?

29:24.514 --> 29:25.647
Uh... Hey!

29:28.284 --> 29:30.551
Down, down! Get down, now!

29:31.920 --> 29:35.256
Stay down!
Stay down! Down!

29:40.796 --> 29:42.430
Fuck.

29:43.566 --> 29:46.168
Kate! Go! Go, go, go!

29:54.412 --> 29:56.847
Okay, I need up-res
re-scans now!

29:56.882 --> 29:58.182
Scanning now.

29:58.216 --> 29:59.883
<i>Re-scanning...</i>

30:07.293 --> 30:09.226
Losing feed,
repeat, losing feed!

30:09.260 --> 30:10.427
Shit.

30:10.462 --> 30:14.030
Michael, come in.
Michael, can you hear me?

30:18.569 --> 30:21.404
Shh, shh, shh.

30:22.874 --> 30:24.442
What?

30:24.476 --> 30:27.145
Scott!
Be quiet.

30:39.493 --> 30:41.126
Get in the bathroom.
What?

30:41.161 --> 30:44.296
Shh, shh. Get in
the bathroom.

30:44.331 --> 30:46.165
Be quiet.

31:08.254 --> 31:09.454
Get dressed.

31:25.606 --> 31:26.939
Fuck.

31:31.078 --> 31:33.045
Pressure on that.

31:33.981 --> 31:36.515
Thank you very much.

31:37.651 --> 31:40.052
Sorry! Sorry!

31:40.087 --> 31:41.988
<i>Michael? Michael,</i>
<i>can you hear me?</i>

31:42.022 --> 31:43.223
I'm here.

31:43.257 --> 31:44.824
Thank Christ.

31:44.858 --> 31:47.626
Okay, give me a sit rep?

31:47.660 --> 31:50.328
Sixteen young men.

31:50.363 --> 31:53.742
In total, Pakistani.
Late 20's, early 30's.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.904
All armed with AK's.

31:55.001 --> 31:57.468
So, how'd they get
past security?

31:57.503 --> 31:59.337
Bags were already
in the lobby.

31:59.371 --> 32:02.373
They're rounding
up civilians.

32:03.575 --> 32:05.343
Six or seven dead.
Three or four wounded.

32:05.377 --> 32:08.346
It's Mumbai all over again.
Stonebridge, Is Scott with you?

32:08.380 --> 32:11.317
No. He's not
among the hostages.

32:11.351 --> 32:13.819
Fuck.

32:16.623 --> 32:18.091
What are you doing?

32:18.125 --> 32:19.625
You got a phone in here?

32:19.660 --> 32:24.297
It's downstairs. We could
someone call for help.

32:24.331 --> 32:26.833
Yeah. We will...

32:26.867 --> 32:30.703
But right now I need you to do
exactly what I tell you, okay?

32:31.839 --> 32:35.508
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

32:35.542 --> 32:36.675
I just want to go home.

32:36.710 --> 32:39.344
I know, I know, and
I'll get you there.

32:39.379 --> 32:41.680
If you do exactly what
I tell you. All right?

32:41.714 --> 32:43.416
Yes. Yes.
Listening to me?

32:43.450 --> 32:45.018
All right, now
come with me.

32:45.052 --> 32:48.121
Don't look down. Don't look
at them. Just come with me.

33:01.538 --> 33:03.739
Passport or cell phone!

33:05.075 --> 33:06.241
Easy.

33:15.819 --> 33:18.188
Hey. Keep your
hand on my back.

33:18.222 --> 33:19.756
Sorry.

33:30.903 --> 33:32.104
Come on.

33:33.306 --> 33:35.908
I saw what you did...

33:35.943 --> 33:37.377
I'm sorry?

33:37.411 --> 33:39.651
When the shooting
started...

33:39.676 --> 33:41.435
those people you helped.

33:48.421 --> 33:49.688
Are you a policeman?

33:49.722 --> 33:53.091
No, a tourist. You?

33:53.125 --> 33:55.860
A tourist, yes.

34:02.401 --> 34:04.469
Hey, come on.

34:06.605 --> 34:08.907
Back!

34:24.257 --> 34:25.858
Fuck.

35:01.297 --> 35:03.431
<i>I've just arrived</i>
<i>outside The Royal Lotus</i>

35:03.456 --> 35:04.756
<i>Hotel in downtown Delhi...</i>

35:04.801 --> 35:08.003
<i>Where we have received</i>
<i>reports of gunfire.</i>

35:23.519 --> 35:25.053
Kate. Are you there?

35:25.087 --> 35:26.654
Michael, I'm here.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.835
Directly behind the
entrance doors,

35:28.860 --> 35:30.757
they've rigged
a necklace of IEDs.

35:30.926 --> 35:33.895
The Army so much as kick
them, it'll detonate it.

35:33.929 --> 35:35.664
Well, can you defuse it?

35:36.799 --> 35:38.467
Not right now.

35:50.613 --> 35:52.047
Colonel.

35:53.583 --> 35:54.950
Go ahead.

35:54.984 --> 35:57.619
I think it's time we
made our presence known.

35:58.721 --> 35:59.921
Understood.

36:15.071 --> 36:17.873
Some of the terrorists
have been killed.

36:17.907 --> 36:20.176
He's saying someone
shot at them.

36:20.210 --> 36:21.944
Good man.

36:24.781 --> 36:29.185
Come in here.
Come in here.

36:29.219 --> 36:30.886
Hey, hey, hey.

36:30.921 --> 36:32.889
Come here. Come here.
No, I'm not going in!

36:32.923 --> 36:34.921
I need you to stay here,
okay?

36:34.946 --> 36:36.346
They're not gonna search
the same room twice.

36:36.393 --> 36:38.161
You understand?
Stay there.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.429
Okay.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.134
Ahhh!

36:44.168 --> 36:47.604
What's going on? Shit.

36:47.638 --> 36:50.240
Okay, hang on, buddy. Hang on.

36:50.274 --> 36:51.123
I'll get help...

36:51.148 --> 36:52.604
Go to the bathroom,
get me some towels.

36:52.876 --> 36:54.021
I'll get help.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.896
No, no, no you
stay here. Fuck!

36:57.847 --> 36:59.381
Hang on, two seconds, buddy.

36:59.415 --> 37:03.853
Be right back. Hang
on, buddy. Hang on.

37:03.887 --> 37:07.223
Okay, don't talk.

37:08.592 --> 37:11.794
Don't... Fuck!

37:14.365 --> 37:15.532
Fuck.

37:33.350 --> 37:37.320
Just what I need. Hey...

37:37.354 --> 37:42.024
It's okay. It's okay,
honey. You all right?

37:42.059 --> 37:45.227
You gotta come
with me. Come on.

37:49.099 --> 37:51.233
Come on. I'm
not a bad man.

37:53.070 --> 37:56.472
Come on, it's okay.

37:56.507 --> 37:59.809
Come on. There we go.
We go for a ride.

37:59.843 --> 38:05.414
There we go.
You okay? Yeah.

38:05.448 --> 38:10.252
Just put your head down
there. Okay? You're okay.

38:10.287 --> 38:12.560
And, don't you look
up. All right?

38:12.585 --> 38:14.694
Just keep your head down.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.660
This man is
definitely Shabbir.

38:17.694 --> 38:20.196
One of Latif's
lieutenants.

38:20.230 --> 38:22.731
Do you recognize any of
the other men in these pictures?

38:22.766 --> 38:24.734
This is the crib.
Colonel.

38:24.768 --> 38:28.237
All right, everyone
out, now.

38:28.271 --> 38:31.206
Major General's here.

38:31.241 --> 38:34.944
Major General Kohli,
I'm Colonel Grant.

38:39.482 --> 38:43.217
You are on Indian soil,
Colonel Grant. Indian soil.

38:43.252 --> 38:45.452
Without prior
permission or consent.

38:45.487 --> 38:47.287
I appreciate that, Sir.

38:47.322 --> 38:51.424
But, we are here pursuing the
Pakistani terrorist, Latif.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.759
I see.

38:53.794 --> 38:56.729
And, yet, you choose to involve
the very same intelligence agency...

38:56.763 --> 38:59.098
That turns a blind eye
to Latif's activities.

38:59.132 --> 39:02.502
Latif is as much an enemy of
our government as yours, Sir.

39:02.536 --> 39:04.137
Countless Pakistanis
have died at his hands...

39:04.171 --> 39:06.005
The government of
Pakistan is weak,

39:06.030 --> 39:07.827
corrupt, and riddled
with traitors.

39:10.579 --> 39:12.714
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't impound this facility...

39:12.748 --> 39:14.850
And place you
all under arrest.

39:14.884 --> 39:17.801
Because, General, I am willing
to give you full access to our

39:17.826 --> 39:19.381
resources here at the section.

39:21.323 --> 39:22.757
I can take that.

39:26.729 --> 39:30.231
And, we have two operatives
inside the hotel.

39:39.106 --> 39:41.775
<i>Michael?</i>
<i>I'm here.</i>

39:41.809 --> 39:44.612
Colonel Grant wants you to be eyes
and ears of the Indian Army.

39:44.646 --> 39:45.813
Understood.

39:46.849 --> 39:48.583
I need to find
Scott first.

39:48.618 --> 39:49.918
<i>And then what?</i>

39:49.952 --> 39:52.354
The two of you take
out 16 armed men?

39:52.388 --> 39:54.923
That's the general idea.

39:54.958 --> 39:56.792
Hey, tourist.

39:56.826 --> 39:58.594
Who are you talking to?

40:18.646 --> 40:21.582
<i>"Mahmood"</i>
<i>must come forward.</i>

40:21.616 --> 40:25.353
He says "Mahmood"
must come forward.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.535
Shh...

40:39.570 --> 40:40.803
Please, please!

40:40.838 --> 40:44.773
<i>If you are</i>
<i>Mahmood, step forward now.</i>

40:44.807 --> 40:47.342
If you are
Mahmood, step forward now.

40:47.376 --> 40:50.311
<i>Or blood will be shed.</i>

40:50.346 --> 40:53.915
Or, or blood
will be shed.

41:01.210 --> 41:03.785
<i>You have 10 seconds</i>
<i>to identify yourself</i>

41:03.810 --> 41:05.910
<i>or the old man dies.</i>

41:05.967 --> 41:07.968
<i>10...</i>
<i>Ten...</i>

41:07.996 --> 41:09.196
Colonel.

41:10.799 --> 41:12.266
They're going to
execute a man.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.669
Stonebridge, do nothing
to give yourself away.

41:14.703 --> 41:18.405
- <i>6, 5, 4...</i>
<i>- 6, 5, 4...</i>

41:18.439 --> 41:19.573
I'm so sorry.

41:19.607 --> 41:23.210
<i>3, 2, 1...</i>
<i>3, 2, 1...</i>

41:35.590 --> 41:38.058
Stonebridge, do
not intervene.

41:38.093 --> 41:39.893
Let me go!

41:47.402 --> 41:52.639
<i>10, 9, 8, 7...</i>
<i>10, 9, 8, 7...</i>

41:52.674 --> 41:59.146
<i>6, 5, 4, 3...</i>
<i>6, 5, 4, 3...</i>

42:10.559 --> 42:13.494
Come on, come on!

42:13.529 --> 42:15.930
Thank you, thank you.

42:21.704 --> 42:24.339
Please, please,
take us with you.

42:24.373 --> 42:25.573
I know a way out!

42:25.608 --> 42:27.342
Through the
laundry, in the basement.

42:27.376 --> 42:28.476
Show me.

42:28.510 --> 42:31.212
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.076
Okay.

43:02.546 --> 43:03.746
Hey.

43:05.882 --> 43:07.082
Shh.

43:15.958 --> 43:20.294
Okay, come on.
Come on. It's okay.

43:22.331 --> 43:24.799
Okay, it's okay.

43:25.902 --> 43:29.238
Hello? It's the
guy from the bar.

43:31.575 --> 43:33.009
I'm here to help.

43:36.882 --> 43:39.617
Get out! Get the fuck
out now! Get out!

43:39.651 --> 43:42.620
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Fuck me.

43:43.823 --> 43:46.391
You all right?

43:46.425 --> 43:49.027
Okay, you're gonna
come with me.

43:49.061 --> 43:51.530
You're gonna go straight
across that hall. Okay?

43:52.899 --> 43:55.801
Go. Go across.

43:57.604 --> 44:01.206
In the bathroom.
In there. Come on.

44:01.241 --> 44:04.409
Can you get me out of here?
Yeah, I'm working on that.

44:04.443 --> 44:07.512
I need to hide here, okay?
I gotta find a safe exit.

44:07.546 --> 44:10.181
You look after her.
I'll be back.

44:15.921 --> 44:17.755
Stonebridge, report.

44:17.790 --> 44:19.624
<i>Colonel.</i>

44:19.659 --> 44:21.359
I know what...

44:29.035 --> 44:31.770
Scott!
Fuck me!

44:31.804 --> 44:32.937
Fuck.

44:32.972 --> 44:34.172
"Friendlies."

44:37.176 --> 44:38.443
Where the
fuck you been?

44:38.478 --> 44:41.279
Ya know? Saving lives,
shooting bad guys.

44:43.383 --> 44:45.617
How many numbnuts you taken out?
Two. You?

44:45.652 --> 44:48.019
Three.
That's good.

44:48.054 --> 44:50.722
That leaves 11. You
wanna shoot some more?

44:50.757 --> 44:52.824
If I have to.

44:52.859 --> 44:55.560
<i>Colonel. I've just</i>
<i>located Scott.</i>

44:55.595 --> 44:57.062
I told you not
to break cover.

44:57.096 --> 44:59.965
Yeah, I know. But I've just doubled
our chances of defusing that IED.

44:59.999 --> 45:02.764
<i>First things first, though.</i>
<i>I have two hostages I</i>

45:02.789 --> 45:03.802
<i>have to get safety.</i>

45:03.803 --> 45:06.504
Hey, you two know
a way outta here?

45:06.539 --> 45:08.373
Yes, downstairs.

45:08.407 --> 45:12.110
Awesome. Hey, buddy, I gotta
go back upstairs, though.

45:12.144 --> 45:14.679
Why?
A girl I met in the bar.

45:14.714 --> 45:16.681
You gotta be kidding me?
Not like that.

45:16.716 --> 45:18.514
Okay, wait, wait...

45:18.539 --> 45:20.583
We've, uh, we've all
gotta stick together here.

45:21.421 --> 45:22.654
Copy that.

45:22.689 --> 45:25.156
Colonel.
Sergeant.

45:25.191 --> 45:27.526
I think I know why Latif's
men are in the building.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.795
They're looking for
someone named "Mahmood."

45:29.829 --> 45:31.797
Mahmood?
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:31.831 --> 45:33.978
<i>The gunmen are</i>
<i>going through passports.</i>

45:34.003 --> 45:35.100
<i>They're trying to locate him.</i>

45:35.101 --> 45:37.737
Which means Latif can't know
what Mahmood looks like.

45:37.771 --> 45:40.206
Why take an entire hotel
hostage for one man?

45:40.241 --> 45:41.908
Well, I don't think it was
supposed to happen that way.

45:41.976 --> 45:44.011
From what I saw
those boys panicked.

45:44.045 --> 45:45.505
I don't know. These men
were prepared.

45:45.530 --> 45:46.930
They had weapons,
explosives.

45:47.048 --> 45:49.783
Maybe the gun men and the
hostages were a smokescreen.

45:49.818 --> 45:51.485
A way of
hiding his true target.

45:51.520 --> 45:55.123
Right. But the gun men, they
were intercepted by security.

45:55.157 --> 45:56.725
<i>They drew their</i>
<i>weapons too quickly...</i>

45:56.759 --> 45:59.261
<i>And the siege started before</i>
<i>they could locate Mahmood.</i>

45:59.296 --> 46:01.230
We're missing the point.

46:01.264 --> 46:03.656
Latif has no intention
of letting anyone in or

46:03.657 --> 46:04.687
out of that building...

46:04.701 --> 46:06.535
Until he's got
what he needs.

46:06.569 --> 46:08.804
<i>Which means</i>
<i>only one thing...</i>

46:08.838 --> 46:10.872
Latif is still
inside the hotel.

46:13.074 --> 46:15.075
Aw, you!

46:16.578 --> 46:18.011
Fuck.

46:22.050 --> 46:24.051
You can stop looking.
