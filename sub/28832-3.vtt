00:01.596 --> 00:04.590
_

00:08.786 --> 00:11.058
Delilah's not living in Ithaca, okay?

00:11.059 --> 00:12.898
Nobody moves to Ithaca on purpose.

00:12.899 --> 00:15.102
- Why not?
- 'Cause it sucks, okay?

00:16.299 --> 00:17.818
She's not here. I'm not buying it.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.162
- Oh, you're not buying it.
- No.

00:19.213 --> 00:20.468
- But you bought Tibet.
- I didn't.

00:20.561 --> 00:22.531
- You bought Japan.
- I don't even know what that word is.

00:22.532 --> 00:24.845
I don't know, these guys I talked
to seemed pretty certain it was her.

00:27.168 --> 00:28.791
Who, these guys here? Bo and Luke Duke?

00:28.859 --> 00:30.965
- Oh, yeah...
- All right, follow me.

00:32.843 --> 00:33.843
Hi. Hey.

00:33.844 --> 00:35.937
- Uh, you're... Are you Donny?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:35.938 --> 00:37.951
Uh, So you guys have seen
our daughter, Delilah?

00:38.279 --> 00:39.960
Mm-hmm.
Lookin' younger than the poster,

00:39.961 --> 00:41.485
but it's definitely her, all right.

00:41.485 --> 00:43.485
Yeah, she walks around here like
she's better than all of us.

00:43.486 --> 00:44.719
Well, she is better than all of yous.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.962
Okay. Hold on.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.344
- Do you know her?
- Nope.

00:47.511 --> 00:49.686
She keeps to herself mostly.
Lives with that rock star.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.174
- He's disabled.
- Yes... Yes, he is.

00:51.757 --> 00:53.698
Okay, well, which one of these
shit boxes is she living in?

00:54.035 --> 00:55.485
We would love to help you guys out

00:55.519 --> 00:56.866
out of the goodness of our hearts,

00:56.900 --> 00:58.281
but we got bills to pay.

00:58.314 --> 01:00.454
Ah, right, of course you do.
The $500 reward.

01:00.490 --> 01:01.521
- Yeah.
- Right. Yeah

01:02.733 --> 01:03.734
Okay.

01:03.769 --> 01:05.150
All right. Here you go.

01:05.184 --> 01:06.876
Hey, hold up. How'd you get that?

01:06.910 --> 01:08.291
Those were only up in Syracuse.

01:08.325 --> 01:09.844
We're amateur detectives.

01:09.879 --> 01:11.513
- It's kind of our thing.
- Yeah, I almost forgot.

01:11.514 --> 01:13.020
I found this phone bill in her garbage.

01:13.054 --> 01:15.539
A lot of calls or what
you might call "collusion"

01:15.574 --> 01:17.248
to some weird number in Russia.

01:17.667 --> 01:20.118
Yeah. Yeah, that's my dad's number.

01:20.234 --> 01:21.494
Do you need more proof?

01:24.514 --> 01:26.171
- Okay. All right. Here you go.
- Yeah.

01:26.205 --> 01:27.862
Now, where is she?

01:27.897 --> 01:29.775
Oh, shit, there she goes.

01:47.710 --> 01:49.021
Oh, shit.

01:52.576 --> 01:54.855
Whoa.

01:55.562 --> 01:56.669
Oh. Oh.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.722
Oh, shit.

01:59.756 --> 02:01.827
Delilah! Delilah!

02:13.908 --> 02:15.876
Are you okay?

02:15.910 --> 02:17.004
Babe?

02:17.097 --> 02:18.246
Babe, are you okay?

02:20.777 --> 02:22.227
- Babe?
- Yeah.

02:32.271 --> 02:33.859
Blue Jay.

02:33.894 --> 02:35.171
Robin.

02:35.608 --> 02:36.620
What?

02:36.655 --> 02:38.749
Um... My twin sister.

02:39.856 --> 02:40.856
Yeah.

02:43.213 --> 02:44.905
- What?
- Yeah.

02:47.597 --> 02:49.019
Twin sister.

02:49.806 --> 02:51.256
I jumped a shark.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.913
Oh.

02:52.947 --> 02:54.431
Aah!

03:06.354 --> 03:08.634
So what brings you by
after all these years?

03:08.800 --> 03:10.585
Oh, we were led to believe
by a couple of morons

03:10.620 --> 03:11.980
that our daughter was staying here.

03:11.982 --> 03:13.325
You have a little girl?

03:13.418 --> 03:14.937
That's so incredible.

03:14.966 --> 03:16.553
Yeah, two kids, actually. Twins.

03:16.588 --> 03:18.107
Wow, just like us.

03:18.141 --> 03:19.625
Well, I would love to meet them.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.861
Are they here? Where are they?

03:20.862 --> 03:25.804
Well, uh, one of them ran away,
and the other one is...

03:25.838 --> 03:27.668
- Oh, my God, where is he?
- He's at my mom's.

03:27.702 --> 03:29.221
Can we just back it up for a second?

03:29.256 --> 03:30.498
Maybe it's the concussion talking,

03:30.533 --> 03:32.293
but remember the other day when I said,

03:32.328 --> 03:33.950
"Is there anything
I don't know about you?"

03:33.985 --> 03:36.228
And you said,
"Well, I don't like squash."

03:36.263 --> 03:37.989
And I said, "The vegetable
or the game?"

03:38.023 --> 03:40.336
- And you said, "Both."
- Both.

03:40.370 --> 03:41.993
Well, maybe you could
have [bleep] told me

03:42.027 --> 03:43.685
you had a twin sister.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.480
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

03:46.514 --> 03:47.930
she's never mentioned you, either.

03:47.964 --> 03:49.103
No, I did. Ah..

03:49.118 --> 03:50.351
It was the last time I talked to you,

03:50.352 --> 03:53.541
as a matter of fact, at the
funeral of, um, uh, Beth...

03:54.005 --> 03:55.696
uh, Becky?

03:55.730 --> 03:57.399
It's Beckany. I never forget a name.

03:58.009 --> 03:59.527
And all you said was, "Oh, hey, B.J."

03:59.562 --> 04:01.150
I met this boring
meathead hockey player,

04:01.184 --> 04:02.979
and I'm gonna use him
to clean up my selfish

04:03.014 --> 04:04.843
destructive lifestyle,"
or something like that.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.189
I don't really... I'm paraphrasing.

04:06.224 --> 04:08.536
- That's...
- A spot-on impression.

04:08.571 --> 04:10.021
Well, now that I've met you,

04:10.055 --> 04:12.540
I can see why she's been hiding you.

04:12.575 --> 04:14.680
Nate the Great, look at you.

04:14.715 --> 04:16.993
You are such a peach.

04:17.028 --> 04:19.202
And you got such strong bones.

04:19.237 --> 04:21.341
Makes me feel awful
I almost broke 'em all.

04:21.377 --> 04:22.649
- Feel that one.
- Ooh.

04:22.651 --> 04:23.655
- Huh.
- Mm.

04:23.689 --> 04:26.024
Stop it.

04:26.382 --> 04:27.866
By the way, I don't tell
you about my past

04:27.900 --> 04:29.454
because my past sucks.

04:29.488 --> 04:31.456
She doesn't suck. She's awesome.

04:31.496 --> 04:33.360
She doesn't seem to have any
of the shit-show genes

04:33.389 --> 04:34.494
your sisters have.

04:34.495 --> 04:36.557
Trust me, she is the
shit-showiest of them all.

04:37.013 --> 04:38.877
For instance, we were
both born in New York,

04:38.911 --> 04:42.284
but she was "raised" in Alabama,
so somehow she has an accent.

04:42.743 --> 04:43.882
That's not how accents work.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.194
That's exactly how accents work.

04:45.228 --> 04:46.711
No.

04:47.626 --> 04:48.821
Mm.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.126
Mmm, that's good.

04:51.545 --> 04:52.891
It's a frozen dinner, Nate.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.171
Well, she heated it up perfectly.

04:55.790 --> 04:57.033
Blue Jay, these are amazing.

04:57.068 --> 04:59.518
Oh, please, call me B.J. I prefer it.

04:59.553 --> 05:01.244
And I'm sure you do, too.

05:01.279 --> 05:03.310
I do.

05:04.075 --> 05:05.731
She can pull off an innuendo.

05:05.766 --> 05:08.009
None of that "spit on it
and stick it in" shit.

05:08.458 --> 05:11.151
Can you believe how two
identical-looking people

05:11.185 --> 05:12.221
could be so different?

05:12.255 --> 05:13.968
Oh, no, we're very much alike.

05:14.223 --> 05:15.776
In fact, when we were kids,

05:15.810 --> 05:18.436
we used to dress the same
and fool our parents.

05:18.606 --> 05:21.609
Too bad they were too busy
being criminals to notice.

05:21.644 --> 05:23.059
Oh, what do you say, Robin?

05:23.094 --> 05:25.613
Let's pull a "Parent Trap"
for old time's sake, huh?

05:25.648 --> 05:26.925
- Huh.
- No.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.168
- Come on, please.
- Yes.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.341
- Yes.
- No.

05:29.376 --> 05:31.289
Just do it. What's the worst
that's gonna happen?

05:35.352 --> 05:36.590
This is not the same dress.

05:36.624 --> 05:38.385
Oh, yes, it is. I make them myself.

05:38.419 --> 05:40.456
Okay, Nate, which one's which?

05:40.490 --> 05:41.689
It's so hard to tell. I mean,

05:41.691 --> 05:43.529
one is a beautiful oil painting,

05:43.562 --> 05:46.945
and the other one is, uh... my wife.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.465
Listen, I would fill this out,
too, if I hadn't had kids, so...

05:49.499 --> 05:51.570
Oh, I've missed you so much,

05:51.605 --> 05:53.572
but I don't blame you
for shutting out your past.

05:53.607 --> 05:55.643
- It sucked.
- Yeah, see?

05:55.678 --> 05:57.542
Do you ever wish
when our mother left J.R.,

05:57.576 --> 05:58.688
she took both of us with her?

05:58.689 --> 06:01.072
Yeah. Yeah, but there was
only one seat on the plane.

06:01.442 --> 06:03.617
Is that what she told you? Hm.

06:03.651 --> 06:05.378
She told me it was
'cause you were fussy.

06:06.689 --> 06:07.897
I was a child.

06:07.931 --> 06:09.537
Well, you two never really clicked.

06:09.538 --> 06:10.727
Oh, what a bitch.

06:10.762 --> 06:11.832
Stop it.

06:11.866 --> 06:14.800
You hush, Robin.
She did the best she could.

06:14.835 --> 06:17.389
Hey, did you know she was living
in Italy of all places now?

06:17.424 --> 06:18.865
- Okay.
- What?

06:19.184 --> 06:20.634
You told me she was dead.

06:20.668 --> 06:22.808
She is. She's dead to me.

06:22.843 --> 06:24.367
That's not the same thing.

06:25.156 --> 06:27.846
She lives in Italy, the one
place I've always wanted to go.

06:28.715 --> 06:29.819
Time to make amends.

06:29.861 --> 06:30.966
Ain't that right, Nate.

06:30.968 --> 06:32.970
I used to blame J.R.
for splitting up our family.

06:33.164 --> 06:34.648
I was only allowed to see my sister

06:34.682 --> 06:36.305
during nondenominational holidays

06:36.339 --> 06:38.030
and the occasional diamond smuggle,

06:38.065 --> 06:40.740
but I said, "No,
that is no way to live!"

06:40.999 --> 06:43.590
So now I talk to J.R.
like almost every other day.

06:44.209 --> 06:45.797
He calls me his gummy bear.

06:45.831 --> 06:48.006
Now I get the nickname.
I mean, it suits you.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.145
So sweet, you know.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.395
You'd be like a Sour Patch.

06:51.665 --> 06:54.530
B.J., who's talking?

06:54.564 --> 06:56.877
Nate, Robin, meet my boyfriend.

06:58.913 --> 07:00.751
Shut up.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.986
- That's not your boyfriend.
- It's Claude.

07:03.021 --> 07:06.197
It's like Claude Gable.

07:06.231 --> 07:07.296
You know what they say.

07:07.297 --> 07:10.128
Two identical sisters
end up with two identical men.

07:10.162 --> 07:12.509
Oh, shit. Jesus.

07:12.544 --> 07:14.787
You're both so clumsy
and accident prone.

07:14.822 --> 07:16.237
You hit me with a car.

07:16.272 --> 07:18.791
Oh! Oh, shit!

07:18.826 --> 07:21.779
Oh, God, I got glass in my shins.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.346
Oh, I got glass in my penis.

07:24.347 --> 07:26.660
See? Two peas in a pod.

07:28.974 --> 07:32.322
Oh, man.

07:35.544 --> 07:38.811
Here comes the sghetti train.

07:38.846 --> 07:41.538
Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,
chugga, chugga.

07:41.573 --> 07:43.092
- Eat some good sghetti.
- What is happening?

07:43.126 --> 07:44.541
It's your favorite kind of sghetti,

07:44.576 --> 07:47.199
the sghetti with the meatballs.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.339
Here comes the airplane.

07:50.568 --> 07:52.079
Wasn't she just a train?

07:52.653 --> 07:54.310
That's your takeaway from all this?

07:54.344 --> 07:56.036
- Ow, sghetti's hot.
- I'm sorry.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.281
Okay, how about now? Just right?

08:00.528 --> 08:01.874
No, it's too cold.

08:01.946 --> 08:03.491
Oh, hush now. You just eat it.

08:08.013 --> 08:10.015
Did he just fall asleep
with his eyes open?

08:10.050 --> 08:12.397
- No, he's awake.
- He's snoring.

08:12.431 --> 08:14.054
He's got wake-apnea.

08:14.088 --> 08:15.503
You know what? I think B.J. and I

08:15.538 --> 08:17.540
are gonna go for a little
walk, catch up, yeah?

08:17.574 --> 08:18.851
Oh, that sounds great.

08:18.886 --> 08:20.992
Honey, do you mind
if I go on a walk with Robin?

08:22.441 --> 08:24.064
Okay, good. I'm just gonna
go tinkle real quick.

08:24.098 --> 08:25.165
I'll be right back.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.652
- You're fine, right?
- What? No.

08:26.687 --> 08:28.033
No, don't leave me here with him.

08:28.068 --> 08:29.517
- She needs help.
- What do you care?

08:29.552 --> 08:30.898
You haven't seen her in 16 years.

08:30.932 --> 08:31.933
She's family.

08:31.968 --> 08:33.349
We don't give up on family we like.

08:33.383 --> 08:35.558
- You said that.
- Yeah, about our daughter.

08:35.592 --> 08:38.181
And we need to get back to
Syracuse and not give up on her.

08:38.216 --> 08:40.942
I can't let her stay
in this relationship.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.323
It's none of your business.

08:42.357 --> 08:44.083
What if someone had told you
to give up on me?

08:44.118 --> 08:45.350
They did.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.359
Who?

08:47.519 --> 08:48.765
Everybody.

08:49.227 --> 08:50.607
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

08:50.642 --> 08:52.076
- You'll be fine, right?
- No, I'm not fine.

08:52.092 --> 08:53.265
Just do it.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.377
So can you hear me?

09:03.620 --> 09:04.915
Oh.

09:06.761 --> 09:10.179
Oh, you weren't snoring.
You were choking on a meatball.

09:10.213 --> 09:11.594
Can you put that back in?

09:11.628 --> 09:12.629
No.

09:12.664 --> 09:14.374
I'm hungry.

09:15.425 --> 09:17.703
Pick up a fork like a big boy.

09:17.738 --> 09:18.980
Oh.

09:19.015 --> 09:20.549
What the hell
are you doing with Claude?

09:20.550 --> 09:21.914
We've been through so much together.

09:21.949 --> 09:23.433
What would he do without me?

09:23.468 --> 09:24.952
I'm still nursing him back to health.

09:24.986 --> 09:27.127
I know, but you...
you can't just live for him.

09:27.161 --> 09:28.645
You have to have a life of your own.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.957
Take Nate for instance.

09:29.991 --> 09:32.615
He's gone above and
beyond for his family.

09:32.649 --> 09:34.548
He's traveled the world
to find our daughter,

09:34.582 --> 09:35.756
and what's he done for himself?

09:35.790 --> 09:36.791
He's done nothing.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.552
- That's incredible.
- No, it's stupid.

09:38.586 --> 09:41.141
The guy is so selfless,
it's eating him up inside.

09:41.175 --> 09:43.522
He really needs to
blow off steam big-time.

09:47.112 --> 09:49.218
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

09:49.252 --> 09:50.667
Like that. Yes.

09:50.702 --> 09:52.036
Nate used to drink like that.

09:52.037 --> 09:53.498
He did. It made him feel great.

09:53.532 --> 09:55.396
He used to call it his
"wha'sup, wha'sup juice."

09:56.541 --> 09:58.848
Yeah, he'd get all liquored up,
and we would have the best sex,

09:58.882 --> 10:01.471
and now he doesn't touch it.

10:01.506 --> 10:02.507
The booze or you?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.267
Ha ha! Both.

10:04.302 --> 10:05.406
I love Nate.

10:05.441 --> 10:07.408
I know. I'm pretty lucky to have him.

10:07.443 --> 10:09.134
I wouldn't tell him that to his face

10:09.169 --> 10:10.860
'cause he'd get a big head, but yeah.

10:10.894 --> 10:14.139
I hate Claude, like, so much.

10:14.174 --> 10:16.215
Like a burning, seething hatred.

10:21.215 --> 10:22.665
It's gonna be a hell of a ride, huh?

10:22.699 --> 10:25.357
Yeah, safety first, man.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.809
Hang on.

10:30.086 --> 10:32.019
You need to put a helmet on?

10:32.053 --> 10:33.613
Just psych a brother up.

10:34.711 --> 10:36.403
Thanks, man.

10:38.577 --> 10:40.372
Probably faster if I just
carried you down.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.891
Yeah.

10:45.239 --> 10:47.345
Dude, you really can't
walk down three stairs.

10:47.379 --> 10:48.656
Soft bones.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.071
What's that mean? Like rickets?

10:50.106 --> 10:51.176
Soft bones.

10:51.211 --> 10:54.006
Doc says I'm like a bag of wet sticks.

10:55.215 --> 10:57.562
That means it's safe
to unbuckle my seat belt.

10:57.788 --> 11:01.186
Oh, man, I forgot my cheese.

11:17.961 --> 11:20.544
You're not gonna believe this.

11:21.620 --> 11:23.484
It's down there.

11:23.519 --> 11:25.055
I can smell it.

11:26.211 --> 11:28.075
We just got to find it.

11:38.913 --> 11:40.191
Means it's done.

11:40.225 --> 11:41.261
You said that.

11:41.295 --> 11:44.160
You can't say important
things too much.

11:46.266 --> 11:48.233
Gonna put it back.

11:48.268 --> 11:50.443
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

11:50.542 --> 11:53.027
Ooh. My goodness.

11:53.169 --> 11:54.550
- Yes.
- You're right.

11:54.584 --> 11:56.539
I need to start doing
some stuff for myself.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.036
That was a quick turnaround, but great.

11:58.070 --> 11:59.762
Yes. Then leave him.

12:01.177 --> 12:03.144
Hey, boys, wha'sup, wha'sup?

12:03.179 --> 12:04.422
Oh, no, no, no.

12:04.456 --> 12:05.940
Looks like someone founds her daughter.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.702
- Uh, no, my daughter's 16.
- Well, no refunds.

12:08.736 --> 12:11.222
Yeah, but we'd like
to buy you fine ladies

12:11.256 --> 12:12.430
a well drink of your choice.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.397
And by "fine ladies," I mean you.

12:20.645 --> 12:22.060
You want some coffee?

12:22.094 --> 12:24.165
- That's coffee?
- No.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.891
Jesus, what do you do down here?

12:26.103 --> 12:27.376
Oh.

12:27.410 --> 12:28.723
Here you go.

12:28.929 --> 12:30.896
Sure, all right.
I've never tried this before.

12:30.931 --> 12:33.140
- Yeah.
- Kill some time.

12:33.174 --> 12:34.659
Oh, my God.

12:34.693 --> 12:36.902
Oh, my God, what do
you do in this thing?

12:36.937 --> 12:38.663
It's a workout.

12:38.697 --> 12:40.009
- Buckle up.
- Yeah.

12:40.043 --> 12:41.804
You're going for a helluva ride.

12:41.838 --> 12:43.668
- Hold my breath.
- Yeah.

12:46.843 --> 12:48.742
What am I watching?
Is this a train set?

12:48.776 --> 12:50.433
Yeah.

12:52.332 --> 12:53.954
It's a little boring, isn't it?

12:53.988 --> 12:56.197
Ah. Yeah.

12:56.232 --> 12:58.614
- What are you supposed to do?
- You're doing it.

12:58.648 --> 13:01.030
That's it? You just watch it
go around the track?

13:01.064 --> 13:02.131
That's right.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.584
If you like model trains so much,

13:03.619 --> 13:04.758
why don't you build a real one?

13:04.792 --> 13:07.692
Fat fingers and little,
teeny, tiny parts

13:08.231 --> 13:09.349
just don't mix.

13:09.383 --> 13:10.695
All right. That was fun.

13:10.729 --> 13:13.456
No, whoa, don't take it off mid-game.

13:13.491 --> 13:14.492
You'll lose.

13:14.526 --> 13:16.873
How do you lose watching a train set?

13:16.908 --> 13:19.688
Oh, lost.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.326
It's all your fault.

13:21.361 --> 13:24.018
I need B.J. to make me feel better.

13:26.262 --> 13:27.422
Oh.

13:27.631 --> 13:29.909
I'm B.J. I bet you boys like that, huh?

13:30.024 --> 13:31.336
- Don't say that.
- Uh, yeah.

13:31.371 --> 13:33.545
You think I have a
pretty mouth for a B.J.?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.340
- Yeah.
- You want to kiss it?

13:35.375 --> 13:37.066
Uh, yeah.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.550
- Okay.
- Oh.

13:41.426 --> 13:43.555
I also think you have
a really pretty mouth.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.833
- Okay.
- Hey, okay.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.352
No, there's too many
teeth in that mouth.

13:47.387 --> 13:49.250
Get back on my lips, other one.

13:55.533 --> 13:56.879
If the earth is round,

13:56.913 --> 13:59.373
then how come this bottle
ain't sliding off the table?

13:59.427 --> 14:00.521
Gravity.

14:00.648 --> 14:02.229
You should come to one of our meetings.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.907
There's a lot more of us flat-earthers
on this globe than you think.

14:04.908 --> 14:06.075
All right, I can't do this anymore.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.629
I can't listen to any more
conspiracy theories.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.756
- Hey, these are just my opinions.
- Which are wrong.

14:09.758 --> 14:11.528
- According to who?
- The laws of science.

14:11.563 --> 14:13.013
- And who wrote those?
- Scientists.

14:13.047 --> 14:15.809
And those are their opinions,
which just so happen to be fake.

14:15.843 --> 14:17.143
What's so hard to
understand about that?

14:17.144 --> 14:18.673
Where the hell is my sister, anyway?

14:18.708 --> 14:19.971
You want to hear another opinion

14:20.038 --> 14:22.118
- that people think is just a "theory"?
- Not really.

14:22.119 --> 14:23.908
Your sister runs
an underground syndicate

14:23.909 --> 14:25.680
that traps men, extracts testosterone,

14:25.715 --> 14:27.130
and relieves them of their manhood.

14:27.165 --> 14:29.201
Yeah, who's got a
basement in a trailer?

14:29.236 --> 14:30.996
- Oh, that's a man cave.
- Mnh-mnh.

14:31.031 --> 14:32.377
It's a man grave.

14:32.411 --> 14:34.758
These are all a year
after living with your sister.

14:34.793 --> 14:35.898
- Before.
- After.

14:35.932 --> 14:37.037
- Before.
- After.

14:37.071 --> 14:38.901
- Before.
- After.

14:38.935 --> 14:39.942
Before.

14:39.943 --> 14:42.525
And you know what
that after looks like.

14:45.355 --> 14:46.909
That's not really you, is it?

14:46.943 --> 14:48.082
Yeah.

14:48.117 --> 14:49.981
I can see how B.J.
fell in love with that,

14:50.015 --> 14:52.846
but what happened?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.193
I was onstage.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.333
The bass player, man.

14:57.367 --> 15:00.232
It was an accident.
I fell and broke my leg.

15:00.267 --> 15:05.422
And then B.J. has been
by my side ever since.

15:06.721 --> 15:08.413
It was B.J.

15:08.447 --> 15:09.621
That's a beautiful story.

15:09.655 --> 15:12.100
So you never went back
to the band or a gym?

15:12.101 --> 15:13.556
No, man.

15:13.590 --> 15:16.296
Gym closed, band kicked me out.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.044
Yeah, you'd be surprised how quickly

15:19.079 --> 15:20.597
they can replace a bassist.

15:20.632 --> 15:21.909
Not really. It's not that hard.

15:21.944 --> 15:25.568
Anyway, I was about to
start my solo career

15:25.602 --> 15:29.261
until B.J. accidentally broke my pelvis.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.604
Whoa. How'd she do that?

15:30.605 --> 15:32.782
She ran over me with her car.

15:32.816 --> 15:34.818
I'm sensing a trend here.

15:34.853 --> 15:36.087
Are you sure it was an accident?

15:36.088 --> 15:38.270
The first time, for sure.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.308
First... How many times
has she hit you with a car?

15:41.342 --> 15:44.186
Three times with a car.

15:44.621 --> 15:46.761
One of those was definitely my fault.

15:46.796 --> 15:48.902
I should have known
to roll out of the way

15:48.936 --> 15:50.834
before she backed up in reverse.

15:50.869 --> 15:52.250
Dude, this sounds like "Misery."

15:52.284 --> 15:54.908
Oh, no, it's not that bad.

15:55.169 --> 15:58.497
You know, I'm hard on her,
but she is an average cook.

15:58.532 --> 16:01.259
"Misery" like the mov... Forget it.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.261
Listen, I'm not into
conspiracy theories at all,

16:03.295 --> 16:07.127
but she sounds like
she's an insane woman.

16:07.161 --> 16:10.648
Oh, no, no, she's bipolar
and schizophrenic,

16:10.854 --> 16:13.650
but other than that, man, she's
a picture of mental health.

16:13.685 --> 16:15.652
Okay.

16:15.687 --> 16:17.447
Um, you know what?

16:17.482 --> 16:18.862
It was great to meet you,

16:18.897 --> 16:21.313
but before any of this
happens to me, I'm gonna...

16:21.348 --> 16:22.970
I'm gonna get the hell out of here.

16:23.005 --> 16:24.178
Good luck.

16:24.213 --> 16:26.077
Yeah, well, I tried to do that once.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.803
When I asked to leave,
the voices in her head

16:28.838 --> 16:31.806
accidentally smashed
my jaw with a brick.

16:31.841 --> 16:33.601
Dude, this door is locked
from the outside.

16:33.636 --> 16:36.816
Yeah, she locks the
doors for my safety.

16:38.158 --> 16:41.367
She makes me wear this ankle monitor.

16:41.816 --> 16:44.384
She likes to know
where I am all the time.

16:44.819 --> 16:50.021
I can get all the way out to the
mailbox before I get shocked.

16:51.067 --> 16:52.829
And it only hurts a lot.

16:53.035 --> 16:54.898
Dude, these are all nailed shut!

16:54.933 --> 16:57.280
Yeah, you got to keep the windows shut.

16:57.315 --> 16:59.656
If you're gonna lock
the doors, no point.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.876
Yeah, that's a steel door.

17:06.910 --> 17:10.025
Figured that out on my third
time I broke my shoulder.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.032
Oh. Ah!

17:13.262 --> 17:14.435
Shit.

17:15.747 --> 17:16.920
So what are you saying? Are we...

17:16.954 --> 17:18.198
Are we trapped in here?

17:18.232 --> 17:19.241
Yeah.

17:19.713 --> 17:20.752
What do we do?

17:26.068 --> 17:27.517
That is so unnerving.

17:27.551 --> 17:29.036
This is insane. You're both insane.

17:29.071 --> 17:31.383
What kind of guy would get
trapped by a 100-pound woman?

17:31.418 --> 17:33.580
Kind of guy who doesn't
have the ability to get away,

17:34.041 --> 17:35.560
like Clump over there.

17:35.594 --> 17:37.010
My God, why would you call him that?

17:37.044 --> 17:39.046
- That's so mean.
- That's what he calls himself.

17:39.081 --> 17:41.428
You need our help,
you know where to find us.

17:45.121 --> 17:46.536
Oh, God.

17:48.573 --> 17:50.230
I'm taking my vagina out of storage.

17:50.264 --> 17:52.370
You want to blow the dust off?

17:53.992 --> 17:57.685
Robin, you were right about everything.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.409
I need to be more selfish.

17:59.894 --> 18:01.931
I want you to make love to me
on that pinball machine

18:01.965 --> 18:03.636
like Jodie Foster in that movie.

18:04.106 --> 18:05.854
No, she was raped in that movie.

18:06.073 --> 18:09.387
Well, we're gonna need some more
wha'sup, wha'sup juice, then.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.871
Oh, hey, pretty. Let's get...

18:10.905 --> 18:12.079
Hey, stop, stop.

18:12.114 --> 18:13.681
You're trying to make out
with everyone in here.

18:13.682 --> 18:15.255
No, quit it with the twincest.

18:15.289 --> 18:16.773
I just want a little of what you have.

18:16.808 --> 18:18.361
I want a Nate of my own.

18:18.396 --> 18:20.592
Well, looks like you and Clump
were hitting it off pretty well.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.471
Oh, my God.

18:22.607 --> 18:24.609
Why would call him that?
That's so mean.

18:24.643 --> 18:25.748
Oh, no, he calls himself that.

18:25.782 --> 18:27.364
- No, I don't.
- Oh.

18:27.957 --> 18:29.476
Um, okay. Well, let's go.

18:29.510 --> 18:30.960
Mm, no.

18:32.651 --> 18:34.826
Boo! Boo, Robin!

18:34.860 --> 18:36.759
She's trying to make me go home!

18:36.793 --> 18:39.106
All right, all right.

18:39.865 --> 18:41.074
Boo!

18:47.183 --> 18:48.460
- B.J.!
- Don't touch me.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.085
- Let's go.
- Stop touching my skin!

18:55.053 --> 18:58.505
- Come on.
- Get off me!

19:00.679 --> 19:01.749
Ah.

19:01.784 --> 19:03.303
Come on. You touch me one more time,

19:03.337 --> 19:04.511
I will knock you off that stage,

19:04.545 --> 19:06.651
handcuff you to a broken
truck door in a deserted barn,

19:06.685 --> 19:08.346
and I will leave you for dead.

19:09.136 --> 19:10.496
You're insane.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.174
But it was so good seeing you.

19:12.208 --> 19:13.865
Let's not let so much time
pass in between visits.

19:13.899 --> 19:15.556
Okay, bye. Call me.

19:24.186 --> 19:25.798
Mm.

19:26.464 --> 19:28.080
I love you so much.

19:28.742 --> 19:31.503
Oh, my God, babe, you were
so right about your sister.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.359
She is nuts.

19:33.574 --> 19:35.507
She trapped us in this trailer.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.130
We got to call the cops
on her or something.

19:37.164 --> 19:39.233
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
you were right.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.897
I need to stop meddling
in other people's lives.

19:42.342 --> 19:43.688
I just want to be with you.

19:43.722 --> 19:45.655
And I know I don't
say this to your face,

19:45.709 --> 19:48.539
but you're everything to me.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.867
- Of course I am.
- Okay, don't get a big head about it.

19:50.902 --> 19:52.145
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

19:52.179 --> 19:53.284
We got to bust him out of here.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.069
He used to be a famous bassist.

19:56.114 --> 19:57.805
He wasn't that famous.

20:05.399 --> 20:07.201
B.J.!

20:07.505 --> 20:09.469
B.J.!

20:10.197 --> 20:14.755
I want to watch "Rudy," but all
my DVDs are on the ground.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.480
B.J.

20:17.515 --> 20:19.464
Oh.

20:20.207 --> 20:22.175
Think I broke another finger.

20:26.571 --> 20:27.732
Oh.

20:29.872 --> 20:33.289
Wha'sup with you, B.J.?
You cut your hair.

20:34.808 --> 20:36.396
God, what's this?

20:36.430 --> 20:38.850
Oh, it's just some loose hair.

20:40.123 --> 20:41.960
Everybody's got loose hair.

20:43.472 --> 20:44.507
Maybe in menopause.
