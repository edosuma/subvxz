WEBVTT

00:02.567 --> 00:04.221
so I'll be able to go back
and forth four...

00:04.265 --> 00:05.483
even five times a week.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.181
[in Arabic]:

00:07.224 --> 00:10.314
- I want you to know, we don't
have to jump into anything.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.187
- What?
- Placement was wrong,

00:13.230 --> 00:14.579
I think I perforated
an organ.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.190
- Call for blood!

00:19.715 --> 00:21.543
[menacing music]

00:32.815 --> 00:34.730
[in Arabic]:

00:46.220 --> 00:48.352
[Mitchell]: Does this man
speak to you?

00:51.747 --> 00:53.314
- Sometimes.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.099
- Are you comfortable discussing
why you were arrested?

00:57.187 --> 01:00.234
- Doctors who treat rebels,
the...

01:00.712 --> 01:02.540
the Regime doesn't like that.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.412
- Has there been
some kind of change or...

01:04.455 --> 01:06.544
reminder that provoked
these memories?

01:09.286 --> 01:11.158
We've spoken before
about triggers.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.248
And when they happen,
you want to fix things.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.988
I have seen enough
to know that.

01:16.032 --> 01:19.166
And your way of doing that
is by running into
burning buildings

01:19.209 --> 01:20.863
trying to save someone else.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.865
It makes you feel in control.

01:23.605 --> 01:27.478
The thing is, post-traumatic
stress is like a faucet.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.001
Once open,

01:29.045 --> 01:31.178
it keeps on flowing, Bash,
whether you like it or not.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.223
- Are you saying
I can't stop it?

01:33.267 --> 01:35.399
- You can find healthy ways
to live with it.

01:35.443 --> 01:38.402
Like letting yourself
feel the memories
and talking about it

01:38.446 --> 01:40.535
instead of shouldering it
alone.

01:41.449 --> 01:44.234
Hey, this is progress.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.889
All we're doing here is learning
to recognize your triggers

01:46.932 --> 01:49.631
so you can control
how to react to them.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.461
- Hmm.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.421
- Are you looking
at apartments?

01:57.465 --> 01:59.684
I told you, man, you can stay
with me as long as you want.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.338
- It's not for me,
it's for Rania.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.558
She's still having a hard time
finding something.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.429
I didn't see you come home
last night.

02:05.473 --> 02:08.258
- I was in my room,
I was on a very important task.

02:08.301 --> 02:11.740
Mel was wiped, so I covered
homework and bedtime

02:11.783 --> 02:13.568
- All on video call?

02:13.611 --> 02:16.440
- Yeah, we made a game
out of it. I was Robot dad.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.007
And it went over
really well with Mel.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.661
She's flying in tonight
and we're gonna out for dinner.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.663
- That's good.
- Did Rania ever find a job?

02:21.706 --> 02:24.535
- Not yet. The government
helps out for the first year,

02:24.579 --> 02:26.015
but she needs to find a place

02:26.058 --> 02:28.539
and a lot of landlords
are hesitant about newcomers.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.716
Long night?
- Yeah.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.544
- Are you finished soon?

02:33.588 --> 02:35.285
- Another hour.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.766
Remember Sonja Jessup?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.985
You know, when Bishop misread
the ultrasound?

02:40.029 --> 02:42.727
- And I punctured her spleen.
Hard to forget that one.

02:42.771 --> 02:45.817
- Well, her case is up
at the Morbidity and Mortality
rounds today.

02:45.861 --> 02:48.690
- I've sat in on a few
M&Ms rounds, but...

02:48.733 --> 02:50.866
never one of my own patients.

02:50.909 --> 02:54.826
- Then you know they're purely
educational and anonymous.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.698
You have nothing
to worry about, Bash.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.526
- Does Bishop?

02:58.569 --> 03:01.268
- Good morning.
Incoming trauma.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.487
- I'm on it.
- Ah, you look tired, Leblanc.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.968
Doctor Hamed, get changed,
meet me outside.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.890
- ETA one minute.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.980
- Um, Doctor Novak, assuming
I have time between patients,

03:18.023 --> 03:20.330
I'd like to attend
the M&M rounds today.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.333
The case in question is mine--
- Oh. No spoilers.

03:23.377 --> 03:26.554
The whole point is an impartial
review of adverse outcomes

03:26.597 --> 03:28.295
and I'm the one leading it.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.646
But by all means join us. We'll
figure out what went wrong.

03:31.689 --> 03:32.995
[sirens wailing]

03:33.038 --> 03:35.389
A guy sliced his femoral
apparently.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.868
It's gonna be bloody.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.656
[gentle music]

03:54.712 --> 03:56.714
- Please don't let him die!

03:56.758 --> 03:58.542
- You need to wait out here.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.979
- Heart rate's 135,
BP's crashing!

04:03.808 --> 04:05.897
- Checking his artery.

04:07.377 --> 04:10.902
Her skate sliced through his
femoral, I can clamp it but...

04:12.339 --> 04:14.863
- IVC's flat.
He's hypovolemic.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.300
That doesn't bode well for
what's happening below the knee.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.910
It's bad news
for a figure skater.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.651
- He's exsanguinating!

04:20.695 --> 04:22.740
Activate MTP,
I need two large bore IV's.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.568
Four units, O-neg.
Rhoda, page vascular!

04:24.612 --> 04:26.962
- Might not be enough.
Ever do an intravascular
shunt back home?

04:27.005 --> 04:29.443
- Yes, but they don't do it
here, as a rule.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.445
- Then we make a new rule.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.969
The shunt increases the odds
when it comes to saving a limb.

04:35.013 --> 04:37.581
- Hemorrhagic shock.
Pulseless Vfib...

04:37.625 --> 04:39.888
- Start bagging and compressing.
Rhoda, one shot epi!

04:39.931 --> 04:43.283
If we can save this kid
and his leg, why wouldn't we?

04:43.805 --> 04:46.024
Make do with what you can find.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.334
Don't stop compressions,
Claire.

04:51.378 --> 04:54.337
Rhoda, prepare to defibrillate.
200 joules.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.773
Be ready on my mark.

04:55.817 --> 04:59.603
Doctor Hamed's going
to build us a bridge,

04:59.647 --> 05:02.737
delivering blood from above
Vince's injury to below it.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.869
- Here? Without vascular?

05:04.913 --> 05:06.088
- Exciting, right?

05:07.611 --> 05:09.831
[machine beeping rapidly]

05:10.875 --> 05:13.095
- Charged!
- Clear!

05:13.138 --> 05:14.792
[machine beeping]

05:16.838 --> 05:19.754
- Sinus rhythm.
- Let's hope it flows...

05:21.756 --> 05:23.323
Beautiful.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.327
[beeping steadily]

05:29.024 --> 05:31.809
Good job, everybody.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.730
[sobbing]

05:47.085 --> 05:49.914
- I haven't thrown up this much
since university.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.873
Should have brought
a toothbrush.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.788
- We've got some mouthwash
once you're done.

05:53.831 --> 05:57.661
- Don't hold your breath. It's
been non-stop for two hours.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.534
- Anything to eat or drink
this morning beforehand?

06:00.577 --> 06:03.058
- I've been trying to drink
more milk, for the calcium.

06:03.101 --> 06:06.409
I was on my phone
so I wasn't paying attention
when I poured it.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.456
- It had already expired.
- No, but...

06:09.499 --> 06:11.588
something else had.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.068
- Is that a mouse?

06:13.111 --> 06:15.853
- A very dead mouse.
In the milk.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.464
That I drank.

06:17.507 --> 06:20.728
- You seem remarkably calm.
- Trust me, I wasn't.

06:20.771 --> 06:24.949
Screamed so loud that my cute
neighbour came to check on me.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.778
Which is when
the puking started.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.085
- Well, it's essentially
food poisoning.

06:30.128 --> 06:33.523
Your body's natural reaction of
expelling what you've ingested.

06:33.567 --> 06:36.744
We'll run some blood work
and get you rehydrated.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.137
[retching]

06:39.181 --> 06:40.878
- Thank you so much!

06:41.923 --> 06:43.881
- Hey, I'm not on the board.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.927
- Because the board is yours.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.190
Congratulations,
Doctor Curtis.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.758
- I got Chief Resident?
- It wasn't unanimous,

06:50.801 --> 06:53.456
but your surgical record swayed
a few holdouts.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.937
That internal decapitation
you caught,

06:55.980 --> 06:58.548
the team you put together
for that aggressive
abdominal tumour,

06:58.592 --> 07:00.594
those were things
people noticed.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.771
One year term, first review
in three months.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.686
You'll lead morning rounds
today.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.992
Get a sense of who's got what
on their plate,

07:08.036 --> 07:09.777
make assignments and...
any patient

07:09.820 --> 07:12.127
that's coming through emerg
is your responsibility

07:12.170 --> 07:14.129
whether you're covering it
or not.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.175
- Oh, I start now?
- Best way to learn.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.048
Also you should know
that the competition was stiff

07:20.091 --> 07:22.877
and will be... unhappy.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.183
Welcome to the deep end.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.190
[indistinct chatter on PA]

07:34.932 --> 07:36.630
[gentle music]

07:40.895 --> 07:43.593
[woman]: It doesn't matter
where I took him, Matt.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.204
Well, you gave up the right
to know how he is.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.685
No. He--
I'm hanging up now!

07:49.294 --> 07:51.079
[sighing]

07:51.122 --> 07:53.995
- I'm sorry, I didn't, ah...
You're the mother?

07:54.038 --> 07:55.779
- That room was empty.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.694
He was finally asleep.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.305
I've been trying to get
the school to stop
calling his father

08:00.349 --> 08:02.830
when he's absent,
but they keep forgetting
to take him off the damn list

08:02.873 --> 08:04.962
even though he doesn't
have custody.

08:05.006 --> 08:08.966
- When did his fever start?
- A couple days ago.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.142
It keeps coming back
when the Tylenol wears off.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.927
At first I thought
he was just tired,

08:12.970 --> 08:15.059
but then, he didn't sleep
at all last night.

08:15.103 --> 08:18.193
We went to two walk-ins
this morning and they said
the wait was gonna be hours

08:18.236 --> 08:20.325
and I'm supposed to be at work.
- He shouldn't be at school

08:20.369 --> 08:22.110
with a temperature
over 38 anyway.

08:22.153 --> 08:25.156
You also said to our triage
nurse something
about a toothache?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.898
- Yeah. He had a cold
and then he said

08:27.942 --> 08:30.684
one of his bottom teeth
was bugging him.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.729
He stopped mentioning it, but
I figured I should tell them.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.034
- What did his dentist say?

08:35.166 --> 08:37.604
- Well, I switched jobs,
and my benefits don't kick in

08:37.647 --> 08:39.039
for another month...

08:39.082 --> 08:43.174
Matt, Eamon's father,
he has better dental, but...

08:43.217 --> 08:45.220
We can't use that anymore.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.962
- Eamon? I'm Theo.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.660
Mind if I take a quick peek
in your mouth there?

08:50.704 --> 08:52.096
Yeah? Roll over for me.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.185
Perfect, alright, open wide.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.665
Good.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.711
Okay.

08:59.321 --> 09:02.324
I'm gonna go talk to your mom
for a second, okay?

09:05.066 --> 09:07.242
We'll have to check
his white blood cell count

09:07.285 --> 09:08.852
and have a dentist weigh in,

09:08.896 --> 09:12.116
but it could be that an abscess
led to an infection.

09:13.378 --> 09:17.034
- I figured it was just a cavity
that could wait a couple weeks.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.950
He needed a new winter coat,
so...

09:19.994 --> 09:21.778
Did I screw up?

09:21.822 --> 09:24.085
- We have an oral surgeon
on call.

09:24.128 --> 09:25.739
She'll take a look.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.654
If she has to drain the abscess,

09:27.697 --> 09:29.743
it'll be covered under
provincial health care.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.619
- Doctor Bishop.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.969
How are you feeling?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.406
- Fine, gathering strength.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.931
- I wasn't sure you'd make it in
today, I'm glad you did.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.629
- I'm not here for the M&M
if that's what you mean.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.370
I'm here as a patient.

09:51.199 --> 09:54.637
- You know, Doctor Novak, he's
running the session. And he's--

09:54.681 --> 09:57.074
- Yes, yes, we've established.
Wants my job.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.077
He's picked a good case
to take up,

10:00.121 --> 10:01.905
plenty to learn
from what happened.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.385
- So, how come you won't...

10:03.428 --> 10:06.127
- If I'm there, others
won't feel free to speak openly.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.824
- But if you're not, then...

10:07.868 --> 10:09.913
- Novak might malign
my good name?

10:11.132 --> 10:13.090
My name can take it.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.179
It's not your fight,
Doctor Hamed.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.059
- Congrats, June.
- Thanks, Erica.

10:25.102 --> 10:28.192
Hopefully, we can work together.
- Don't we already?

10:28.236 --> 10:31.456
And hey, I asked Alex
to show me his system

10:31.500 --> 10:35.983
on consults and OR assignments
in case I got the job but...

10:36.026 --> 10:38.159
I don't mind walking you
through it.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.641
- I'll figure it out,
but thank you.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.864
What the hell is that?

10:47.908 --> 10:50.214
- I'm asking Public Health
to test it.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.781
Patient found it
in a bag of milk.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.696
- Like, after they drank
from it?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.785
- Mm-hmm.
[June]: Argh...

10:55.829 --> 10:57.961
- Oh, my God! June!
- What?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.354
- You got the job!

10:59.397 --> 11:01.399
[excitedly]: Chief Resident!

11:01.443 --> 11:03.706
Oh, my God! It's amazing!
- Thank you.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.360
- Any blowback
from the other applicants?

11:05.403 --> 11:08.363
- If there is I'll just have
to tune it out and do the work.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.761
Something I feel like
you might know all about?

11:14.804 --> 11:16.719
Is he still keeping you
out of traumas?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.852
- Or telling me
I'm doing them wrong.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.985
Anyway as soon as Public Health
is on board, my shift's over.

11:22.029 --> 11:24.292
You should know Mr. Conor
in three needs a scope.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.381
Possible ulcer.
- Oh, okay.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.992
- I'm so happy for you, June--
- Are you gonna hug me again?

11:29.036 --> 11:32.909
[chuckling]
- Boundaries, please.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.091
- Trish?

11:41.135 --> 11:42.832
- How's Vincent?

11:42.876 --> 11:45.705
- He's doing well, he's stable
and about to go into surgery.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.795
- Nothing like this has ever
happened to us before.

11:50.231 --> 11:53.495
- How long have you two been...

11:53.538 --> 11:55.192
Together?

11:55.889 --> 11:57.281
- Ten years.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.240
People always ask
if we're a couple but...

11:59.283 --> 12:01.764
we basically grew up on the ice,
so more like siblings,

12:01.808 --> 12:03.200
partners.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.462
It's hard to explain.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.900
- One of the nurses
recognized your names.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.771
You skate for the country?

12:08.815 --> 12:10.773
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar
with the sport.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.209
- It's not like we're famous.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.298
You need to be ranked 25th
or better in the world

12:14.342 --> 12:17.040
to make it on the National team
and qualify for the Olympics.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.781
Right now we're 42nd.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.522
- That's still
very impressive.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.918
Vincent's been asking for you.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.054
- He looks so pale...

12:31.098 --> 12:33.796
- That's normal for someone
who lost so much blood.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.146
It's okay.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.066
- Are you okay?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.025
- Are you seriously
asking me that?

12:45.068 --> 12:47.375
My blade almost killed you.
- Because I dropped you!

12:47.418 --> 12:49.812
What went wrong, T?
- I don't know.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.249
But I've been running it
through in my head so when
we get back out there...

12:52.293 --> 12:54.338
- Trish
- Coming into that turn,
if my freeside's forward

12:54.382 --> 12:56.297
and yours is out--
- Trish.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.605
Doctor Hamed's saying
this operation could put me
out for six months.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.477
- Six months?

13:03.870 --> 13:07.830
- The blade sliced very deep,
severing tissue and muscle,

13:07.874 --> 13:10.137
and our vascular surgeons
might have to take more

13:10.180 --> 13:12.443
to permanently repair
Vincent's artery.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.358
We won't know the extent
until they go in.

13:14.402 --> 13:17.057
- But everything we've worked
for. This was our shot.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.885
- And if we miss
the whole season...

13:18.928 --> 13:20.190
- This can't be happening.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.628
I'll get it right this time...

13:23.672 --> 13:25.369
- Get what right?

13:25.413 --> 13:28.024
Roland says we should be
extensions of each other

13:28.068 --> 13:29.939
so I need to keep practicing.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.854
- What? He was our first coach,
when we were kids.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.464
We haven't seen him in years.
- Trish?

13:33.508 --> 13:34.639
I need help in here!

13:34.683 --> 13:36.119
- What's wrong with her?

13:36.163 --> 13:38.121
- She may have fallen
on her head.

13:38.165 --> 13:41.255
We need to get her to CT,
check for signs of concussion
or skull fracture.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.996
- Find us a stretcher.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.259
- Doctor Hamed, wait.
- What is it, Vincent?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.348
- She's been taking something.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.567
She doesn't know that I know.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.662
- Mr. Conor was asking about us
sending him home

13:57.706 --> 13:59.795
when this happened.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.449
- Did your stomach pain
get worse?

14:01.492 --> 14:03.320
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:03.364 --> 14:06.889
Based on your history,
it's probably a bleeding ulcer
or gastritis.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.893
Hey, I called for a scope
for him like an hour ago.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.503
Any idea why no one came
to get him?

14:12.547 --> 14:14.810
- A resident needs to be
assigned for that.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.334
- I'm gonna take you up myself.

14:17.378 --> 14:20.598
And I will ask Erica Harris
to cover me in emerg.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.426
- Can you get us a chair?

14:22.470 --> 14:25.081
We'll give your wife a call,
let her know what's going on,
okay?

14:25.125 --> 14:27.431
[indistinct chatter]

14:27.475 --> 14:29.390
- Heard you were looking for me?

14:29.433 --> 14:30.913
- He started breathing heavy
a few minutes ago

14:30.957 --> 14:32.480
and saying his head hurts?
- Okay.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.482
Eamon, could you sit up
for me?

14:34.525 --> 14:36.484
Okay, good.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.399
Take some big breaths,
buddy.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.705
[wheezing]

14:42.969 --> 14:46.450
Okay. You can sit back down.
Perfect.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.974
I heard from the oral surgeon.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.454
She says there was
a ruptured abscess

14:50.498 --> 14:52.456
which likely led
to the infection.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.807
How long's he had these marks?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.940
- I don't know.
I've never noticed them.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.381
[gentle music]

15:08.559 --> 15:11.954
Arnold? EKG.
Page cardio stat.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.347
- Copy that.

15:15.131 --> 15:19.092
- Eamon, I need you to take
a big breath and hold it for me,
okay?

15:20.702 --> 15:21.921
- What's happening to him?

15:25.533 --> 15:26.969
- Good job.

15:28.753 --> 15:32.801
Those marks on his hands and
feet are called Janeway lesions.

15:32.844 --> 15:36.196
What that tells me is that
Eamon's heart is throwing out
tiny little blood clots.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.024
And I heard a murmur
when I listened.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.113
- In his heart?! What does that
have to do with a toothache?

15:40.156 --> 15:42.028
- Mommy, I'm scared.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.986
- That's okay, baby.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.988
What do we do
when we feel afraid?

15:46.032 --> 15:48.469
Huh?
Take a deep breath,

15:48.512 --> 15:50.645
we put our scariest face
and we say...

15:50.688 --> 15:52.038
[together]: Go away fear!

15:52.081 --> 15:54.083
- Okay, that's good.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.131
- Eamon may have something
called endocarditis,

15:58.174 --> 16:02.135
it's an infection in one or more
of the valves of the heart.

16:02.178 --> 16:06.052
Sometimes, oral infections
can travel to other parts
of the body

16:06.095 --> 16:07.923
when left unchecked.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.882
- When left unchecked.
- We'll do X-rays to confirm

16:10.926 --> 16:13.885
and an echo to see if or...

16:13.929 --> 16:16.497
how it affected
his heart function.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.064
- And if it has,
how do you fix it?

16:18.107 --> 16:19.935
- That depends on how far
it's progressed.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.720
Cardiology will tell us
if he needs surgery

16:22.764 --> 16:24.896
or if it can be managed
with medication.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.507
- Hi.

16:28.030 --> 16:31.947
- Arnold here is going to put
some stickers on your chest,
okay, Eamon?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.036
I promise you,
it won't hurt one bit.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.212
- But it might tickle
a little bit.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.571
- You think I'm a bad mom
for leaving it so long.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.661
- I never meant to imply--
- Maybe not. But you did.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.664
Look,

16:54.622 --> 16:56.885
Eamon's dad was abusive.

16:56.928 --> 17:01.629
And about six months ago,
it got real bad, so we got out.

17:02.282 --> 17:05.111
And I don't want him to know
where we are. Ever.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.896
But that also means
not taking his money,

17:07.939 --> 17:11.073
so that means Eamon has to live
with less because

17:11.117 --> 17:13.684
I can't give him
everything he needs.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.513
And now my little boy's heart...

17:19.516 --> 17:21.518
[sobbing]

17:24.130 --> 17:26.045
Please help him.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.135
[city soundscape]

17:30.310 --> 17:32.790
[indistinct chatter]

17:36.925 --> 17:38.579
- Hey, Cam!

17:39.319 --> 17:42.061
I'm sorry! I know you only
have 45 minutes, I'm sorry!

17:42.104 --> 17:43.932
- I lied. I have 90.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.153
- You ordered anyway?
- I was starving, sorry.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.329
And you're actually earlier
than I thought.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.679
- Oh, my God, this woman drank
an entire bag of milk

17:51.722 --> 17:53.159
before she realized
there was a dead mouse in it.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.943
I had to stay
and fill out paperwork

17:54.986 --> 17:56.901
and it just took me way longer
to convince Public Health

17:56.945 --> 17:58.903
to get it tested for hantavirus,
just forever.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.863
- Well, there's my appetite.
My sister, Magalie, James.

18:01.906 --> 18:04.170
And that's on the low end
of weird for her.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.128
- Just a coffee for now,
James, thank you.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.999
- This is for you.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.176
[in French]:

18:10.219 --> 18:12.308
- Their war against clutter
continues.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.049
[in French]:

18:36.941 --> 18:38.943
[gentle music]

18:39.596 --> 18:41.250
Doctor Mann.

18:41.294 --> 18:42.947
[in French]:

18:59.312 --> 19:01.096
- It's just, you know, when...

19:01.140 --> 19:04.360
like the entire essence
of your being offends someone?

19:04.404 --> 19:07.624
It's kind of hard not to start
believing it.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.714
- You can't just tell him off?

19:10.758 --> 19:13.717
- No! No, that would really make
things worse for me.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.937
Are you gonna eat that?
You're not gonna eat that.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.113
[in French]:

19:18.157 --> 19:20.028
[chuckling]

19:22.117 --> 19:24.293
- More labs on Trish Albrecht.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.990
Head CT's normal.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.213
- Her transaminase levels are
way too high.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.781
There's something
in her system.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.783
- Maybe what her partner said
might explain that.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.959
- But I can't just come out
and accuse her.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.312
M&M rounds today.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.662
You heard about
what's being discussed?

19:46.446 --> 19:48.317
I tried to tell him.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.845
[phones ringing, hubbub]

19:55.977 --> 19:59.676
There is a toxin
in your body, Trish.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.026
It's damaging your liver.

20:03.158 --> 20:07.380
We need to know
if there's anything
you've taken or ingested.

20:07.423 --> 20:10.818
Even too much acetaminophen
can lead to this.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.821
We won't know if we can reverse
or stop the damage

20:13.864 --> 20:15.431
if we can't isolate
the cause.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.261
- Supplements.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.003
They're supposed to be natural.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.918
- Supplements from a pharmacy?

20:23.961 --> 20:26.790
- One of the trainers
at our club gets them online.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.314
- Do you know what's in them?

20:28.357 --> 20:31.882
- Muscle proteins, beta-alines.
Nothing illegal.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.320
- Performance enhancers?
- No!

20:34.363 --> 20:39.716
No HGH. Nothing banned that
would show up on a drug test.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.852
Vincent doesn't know.

20:44.895 --> 20:48.116
- How long have you been
taking these?

20:48.159 --> 20:49.944
- A few months.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.251
After I fell
and hurt my knee.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.516
But... I'm gonna be okay,
right?

20:56.559 --> 20:59.170
- The IV fluids are flushing
your system.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.737
Now that we know the cause,

21:00.781 --> 21:02.304
we'll look for a way
to stop the damage.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.872
- And if you can't?

21:04.915 --> 21:07.744
- Let's take it
one step at a time.

21:07.788 --> 21:11.357
We'll see how you respond
to treatment
and we'll take it from there.

21:11.400 --> 21:17.972
- We're 22. And I know
that sounds young but...

21:18.407 --> 21:22.106
There's always stronger skaters
coming up behind you.

21:22.846 --> 21:25.109
And if we don't make it
this season...

21:29.462 --> 21:31.377
I did this to us.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.510
[gentle music]

21:34.554 --> 21:38.340
- 34-year-old patient
with multiple undiagnosed AVMs.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.864
Pleural effusion required
a chest tube.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.780
The attending physician guided
placement via ultrasound

21:43.824 --> 21:45.869
while the Resident managed
insertion, after which

21:45.913 --> 21:47.436
there was a sudden withdrawal
of frank blood,

21:47.480 --> 21:49.264
indicative of splenic
laceration.

21:50.004 --> 21:53.486
Our agenda with these rounds is
to examine what happened

21:53.529 --> 21:55.923
and to invite discussion
about how to prevent

21:55.966 --> 21:57.446
similar outcomes in the future.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.275
- Seems simple enough.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.364
The Attending misread
the ultrasound.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.974
- Thanks, Doctor Singh.
Yes.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.150
There was a lapse in vision

22:06.194 --> 22:08.327
caused by a medical condition...

22:08.370 --> 22:10.372
[machine beeping]

22:10.416 --> 22:12.374
[suspenseful music]

22:12.418 --> 22:14.376
- Keep going.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.944
- ...after which the Resident
misplaced the tube.

22:16.987 --> 22:19.294
- That's addressed in the chart,
and the case notes.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.818
- Human fallibility.
So, in other words,

22:21.862 --> 22:24.343
it's pretty dull
from a clinical perspective.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.476
- Why then, Doctor Novak,
did you want us taking up
this case today?

22:27.520 --> 22:29.957
- You're asking
the right question, Wendy.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.525
We know how it happened,
but not why.

22:32.568 --> 22:36.355
And when you tug
that particular thread,
things get interesting.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.446
Systemic failure of
leadership

22:40.489 --> 22:43.884
led to this entirely
preventable incident.

22:49.977 --> 22:53.415
- You know the drill when
it comes to the Motor Assessment
Scale, Doctor Bishop.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.374
You get your score
at the end.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.593
Now, this next one's timed.

22:57.637 --> 23:01.771
What I'd like you to do now
is pinch between your thumb
and forefinger,

23:01.815 --> 23:05.949
then middle, ring, and little
finger, as fast as you can.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.603
Okay.
Are you ready to start?

23:12.129 --> 23:13.609
As fast as you can,
Doctor Bishop.

23:13.653 --> 23:14.784
Then change hands, please.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.966
That's fine, you can rest.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.666
[Novak]: This shouldn't have
happened.

23:27.536 --> 23:29.495
It's on record that
the Attending suffered

23:29.538 --> 23:31.540
a significant brain injury
months earlier.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.977
- Doctor Novak,
as you acknowledged,

23:34.021 --> 23:37.546
the Attending physician admitted
that his medical condition

23:37.590 --> 23:40.549
led to the error.
Acute vision loss.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.987
- Unless you're saying
his vision loss wasn't just
"in the moment"?

23:44.031 --> 23:45.815
- No, I think since
you're asking that question,

23:45.859 --> 23:47.600
it's worth exploring.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.558
- Is that for all my hard work?

23:49.602 --> 23:50.864
[chuckling]

23:50.907 --> 23:52.735
- Now with your right arm,

23:52.779 --> 23:56.043
take a jellybean from one cup,
and place it in the next.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.444
And now with your left.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.582
- Bugger.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.195
I can't...

24:18.239 --> 24:20.154
- We'll try this one again
next time.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.984
- You're suggesting
the Attending

24:24.027 --> 24:26.029
was aware
of his deficiencies

24:26.073 --> 24:28.597
and risked patients anyway?

24:28.641 --> 24:30.773
That's a hell of an allegation.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.775
- And not the point of
this forum.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.516
- Logging my failures?

24:34.560 --> 24:37.171
- In this room
we call them opportunities.

24:38.172 --> 24:41.088
- Not sure a trauma patient
needing treatment
would see it that way.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.698
- There's still work
to do, sir,

24:42.742 --> 24:44.787
but it's nothing to be
afraid of.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.703
[Novak]: What are the odds
that this was the first time

24:47.747 --> 24:49.792
he presented the symptom?

24:49.836 --> 24:51.707
And yet no one on his team

24:51.751 --> 24:54.057
raised any objection to him
practicing?

24:54.101 --> 24:56.190
[scoffs]
I mean, we're not a shy bunch.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.539
Why not speak up?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.846
Did people fear
repercussions?

25:02.152 --> 25:05.895
Was there a culture of fear
in our emergency department?

25:05.939 --> 25:07.984
- That's not what happened.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.074
The Attending, and...

25:11.118 --> 25:13.555
everyone knows
you mean Doctor Bishop,

25:13.599 --> 25:16.689
fosters an environment of
open communication.

25:17.646 --> 25:20.562
And as the aforementioned
Resident in this case,

25:20.606 --> 25:22.999
I can confirm that
he invites us to push back.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.219
- Then why didn't you?

25:25.959 --> 25:28.788
How was it that a staff of fully
trained physicians,

25:28.831 --> 25:32.748
who diagnose patients that
they've just met every day,

25:32.792 --> 25:35.185
couldn't spot
even the tiniest indication

25:35.229 --> 25:37.100
that something
was wrong with him?

25:37.144 --> 25:39.189
- Because he was hiding it.

25:40.190 --> 25:43.019
He knew he wasn't recovering
properly from his head injury

25:43.063 --> 25:45.021
though he did know
how bad it was.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.937
But that lack of judgment
was his.

25:47.981 --> 25:50.026
No one else's.

25:54.074 --> 25:57.164
[gentle music]

26:07.827 --> 26:09.829
- What the hell, June.

26:09.872 --> 26:12.788
- I was just in surgery.
Scoping some bloody ulcers.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.661
The guy's fine.
GI's in there,
sealing them up now.

26:15.704 --> 26:16.792
Just got to keep him
overnight.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.838
- A patient I know
nothing about.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.797
- Okay, I thought I was
responsible for assigning
the residents to OR's?

26:21.841 --> 26:23.277
- So you assigned yourself?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.627
Without finding anyone
to cover emerg?

26:25.671 --> 26:27.673
I know it's your first day
but, man!

26:27.716 --> 26:29.196
- Harris said she was on it.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.981
- Doctor Harris is in OR seven
on a whipple.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.680
I can't be micromanaging you
like this, June.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.552
You've been given a team,
use it.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.859
[sighing]

26:41.687 --> 26:43.819
[phone ringing]

26:43.863 --> 26:45.299
- Hey. Everything okay?

26:45.342 --> 26:48.128
- With me, yes.
But you sound upset.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.043
What's wrong?
- Just a busy day...

26:50.086 --> 26:51.827
I'm fine.

26:51.871 --> 26:53.829
Uh, the place I found.
Did you go see it?

26:53.873 --> 26:56.092
[in Arabic]:

27:00.793 --> 27:03.012
- But they said they'd take care
of the references.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.188
[in Arabic]:

27:08.235 --> 27:10.063
- Okay, well, let me
call them back.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.674
- Actually I have found
something else.

27:12.718 --> 27:16.591
A Syrian friend from class
has an extra room.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.855
Near Keele and Lawrence.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.037
- And the people
you'll be living with?

27:28.081 --> 27:31.693
- I just met them.
Three women and two men.

27:31.737 --> 27:35.088
One of whom may or may not
already want to marry me.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.963
[chuckling]
I'm kidding.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.749
- What, about him
wanting to marry you?

27:43.792 --> 27:46.142
Or that you'll be living
with people you don't know?

27:46.186 --> 27:47.230
- Bashir,

27:47.274 --> 27:49.711
I can take care of myself.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.235
- I know. It's just...

27:52.279 --> 27:53.889
Yes. Of course.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.674
[in Arabic]:

28:03.943 --> 28:07.729
- Ah, yes. Singing and crude
jokes. You'll love it.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.950
[pager beeps]

28:10.993 --> 28:14.127
Ah, Rania, I have to go.

28:14.170 --> 28:17.043
[They say goodbye in Arabic.]

28:20.960 --> 28:22.918
- She's in and out,
still confused.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.965
Her sats are low and her blood
ammonia level came back high.

28:29.055 --> 28:33.189
- Hypotensive, tachycardic. AST,
ALT, bilirubin all spiking.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.191
She's in acute liver failure.

28:35.235 --> 28:39.369
- Encephalopathy grade 3,
that's the threshold
for intubation, right?

28:39.413 --> 28:41.415
Otherwise she's at risk
of not protecting her airway?

28:42.285 --> 28:44.766
- Yes. I'll sedate her,

28:44.810 --> 28:47.769
and you call RT for intubation
and...

28:47.813 --> 28:50.293
insert an OG tube
for lactulose.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.817
Claire?

28:52.469 --> 28:54.689
What you said in there...

28:55.037 --> 28:57.344
Did Doctor Bishop ask you
to do that?

28:59.389 --> 29:02.001
- I'll let you know
when she's intubated.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.833
- How are you feeling, Vincent?
- Can I see Trish?

29:07.876 --> 29:11.793
- She's not awake.
We're doing our best
to look after her.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.142
- Was it her head?

29:13.186 --> 29:15.318
- No.
- Then I was right.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.147
What did those things
do to her?

29:18.887 --> 29:21.237
- Trish is in acute
liver failure.

29:22.021 --> 29:24.937
- No, don't tell me that.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.808
I didn't say anything.

29:27.243 --> 29:29.332
I could have stopped her
from taking them.

29:29.376 --> 29:32.118
But she was getting stronger and
we were having our best year.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.120
Can you help her?

29:34.163 --> 29:37.863
- We're doing everything
we can, but if we don't slow
the toxicity down soon--

29:37.906 --> 29:39.299
- She could die?

29:40.866 --> 29:43.259
- I'm sorry, Vincent.
It's a possibility.

29:45.131 --> 29:48.134
- She's always had to work
harder physically...

29:49.788 --> 29:54.053
... but we joke that she's
the artist and I keep us
tethered to reality.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.405
And I let her fall.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.322
- You got an early flight?

30:07.153 --> 30:08.937
The girls've probably
already talked your folks

30:08.981 --> 30:10.721
into buying them
an armload of candy.

30:10.765 --> 30:14.334
- I'm sure they have.
- I know I said
I could duck out early,

30:14.377 --> 30:16.075
but it's been busy today.

30:16.118 --> 30:19.339
I did, however,
snag us a 9PM table.

30:19.382 --> 30:22.821
You could go early,
sit with a glass of wine.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.043
Mel, what's wrong?

30:28.914 --> 30:31.786
- It's not working, Theo.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.267
- Since when?

30:36.312 --> 30:39.272
I've been trying so hard
to make this work for us.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.100
- I know you have.

30:41.143 --> 30:42.449
I do.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.234
But it's...

30:46.148 --> 30:47.846
not enough.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.587
- It'll get better.

30:50.631 --> 30:53.895
I promise. Once I settle in,
I'll be less scattered.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.332
We'll have more time
to figure this all out.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.945
- I'm not happy, Theo.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.512
- No. Mel.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.039
I can fix that,

31:07.082 --> 31:08.910
I know I can.

31:08.954 --> 31:09.955
- You can't.

31:13.959 --> 31:18.485
Because when you chose this,
you didn't choose me.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.837
- Okay.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.624
Okay, so...

31:27.668 --> 31:29.888
Then I un-choose it.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.935
I'll come home and we'll go back
to the original plan.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.242
- Please don't try telling me
you want to come home.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.939
It's too late for that.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.943
The past month,
you doing this job,

31:41.987 --> 31:44.903
it's the happiest
I've seen you for so long.

31:51.474 --> 31:55.130
You can still be a great dad
to your daughters.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.045
[panting]

31:58.917 --> 32:00.527
- I'm sorry.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.618
- Me too.

32:09.362 --> 32:10.972
I'm going to go.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.935
[soft, dramatic music]

32:22.027 --> 32:23.985
- Where have you been,
Doctor Curtis?

32:25.030 --> 32:28.033
We can't be left scrambling
for surgical consults

32:28.076 --> 32:30.731
when you're not here.
- I know, I'm sorry.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.821
- We managed, you'll learn.

32:33.864 --> 32:36.650
It's good to see you coming up
in the world, Doctor Curtis.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.873
- Did he really say
all that stuff about Bishop?

32:43.526 --> 32:45.354
- I just...

32:46.442 --> 32:49.054
hate that man.

32:49.924 --> 32:54.363
[on PA]: Doctor Curtis to ICU.
Doctor Curtis, ICU.

32:54.407 --> 32:55.974
- Go. Better hurry.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.454
- Okay.
[sighs]

33:00.761 --> 33:03.068
[machine beeping rapidly]

33:03.111 --> 33:05.548
- She needs mannitol
and hypertonic saline.

33:05.592 --> 33:07.855
She just started convulsing.

33:07.898 --> 33:11.076
- A decorticate posturing.
You're thinking cerebral edema?

33:11.119 --> 33:12.860
- Mm-hmm.
- Well...

33:12.903 --> 33:16.516
I mean, it is a statistical
complication of liver injury.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.561
- I'll get a CT to confirm.
But if we're right,

33:18.605 --> 33:20.955
she'll need a craniotomy
to drain the fluid
from her brain.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.044
- Okay.
I'll prime a neurosurgeon.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.396
[suspenseful music]

33:29.094 --> 33:31.748
[city soundscape]

33:36.971 --> 33:38.973
- What the hell, Erica?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.975
I thought I asked you
to cover for emerg.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.195
- A senior oncologist
needed me in surgery.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.848
I was supposed to say no?

33:44.892 --> 33:47.634
- You could have asked somebody
else, you could've paged me!

33:47.677 --> 33:49.984
- You told me you didn't need
help learning the system.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.987
You know you need backups
for your backups, right?

33:54.989 --> 33:57.731
Is that the emergency
craniotomy?

33:58.775 --> 33:59.907
Who's assisting?

33:59.950 --> 34:01.909
- I assigned another resident.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.607
But you can be the backup.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.653
[dry chuckle]

34:10.135 --> 34:11.701
- Hey!

34:13.485 --> 34:15.487
Heard about the other
figure skater.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.446
Quite the pair, those two.

34:19.969 --> 34:22.016
Listen, I'm glad
you punched back earlier.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.540
It's how those sessions are
supposed to be.

34:24.583 --> 34:26.063
Lively. Illuminating.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.545
You look up to Bishop.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.940
I get that.
He's a brilliant guy.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.203
- He took a chance on me.

34:35.246 --> 34:37.945
- Now you feel like your
survival here depends on him.

34:40.034 --> 34:42.036
I know what it's like
to need his approval.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.603
It's like his residents
are starving,

34:44.647 --> 34:46.735
and he controls
the food supply.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.824
- That may have been
your experience with him,

34:48.869 --> 34:50.175
it's not mine.

34:52.699 --> 34:56.094
- Doctors from your country,
it's not easy to get
your credentials out.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.796
I looked into your file.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.146
There's no medical
transcripts there.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.714
There's just a sworn statement
from Bishop saying he...

35:07.757 --> 35:09.194
swears they exist.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.847
- They do.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.112
What are you saying?

35:14.808 --> 35:16.201
- Just that I know
how it feels

35:16.244 --> 35:18.028
when his approval
doesn't come.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.556
If you need anybody else
in your corner,

35:23.599 --> 35:24.992
I'm there.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.255
Remember that, Doctor Hamed.

35:31.346 --> 35:32.695
- Hey, hey!

35:32.739 --> 35:36.134
- You're back.
- And you're still here.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.572
- Why does it feel like the last
12 hours since I've seen you

35:39.615 --> 35:41.226
have been one minute?

35:41.269 --> 35:43.141
- Does that mean it was
a good first day?

35:43.184 --> 35:46.666
- More like an ongoing ordeal
of just disappointing everyone?

35:46.709 --> 35:48.276
- June.
- Oh, yeah.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.277
[pager beeps]

35:49.321 --> 35:50.757
[sighs]
It's Doctor Singh.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.628
I wonder what else I messed up.

35:52.672 --> 35:54.543
- It will be okay.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.164
- This came back for you.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.210
- But Public Health is supposed
to be testing it.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.473
I spent an hour on hold
and I talked to two people.

36:11.517 --> 36:13.258
- When did you have the time
to do that?

36:13.301 --> 36:15.608
- This morning after my shift.
And I know, I know.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.436
You think it was
a waste of energy.

36:17.479 --> 36:19.220
- And the person who makes
the final decision

36:19.264 --> 36:20.613
at Public Health agrees.

36:20.656 --> 36:23.181
Unless the patient's
symptomatic for hantavirus,

36:23.224 --> 36:24.747
which yours was not,

36:24.791 --> 36:27.489
they're not gonna test the mouse
because she isn't at risk.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.796
- Okay, then why are you
giving it back to me?

36:29.839 --> 36:32.842
- Oh, I thought, knowing you,
you might want to...

36:32.886 --> 36:34.670
dissect it
and test it yourself?

36:34.714 --> 36:38.196
Or at least
give it a proper burial.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.502
- Listeria outbreak
in a U of T dorm.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.461
Curtains are starting
to line up.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.114
Sorry, Mags.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.812
- Have a fun night.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.467
[phones ringing]

37:04.570 --> 37:08.400
- I spoke with the cardiologist
again.

37:08.748 --> 37:13.361
Everyone's confident that
he'll be able to fight off
the infection without surgery

37:13.405 --> 37:16.146
and avoid any damage
to his heart.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.844
[sighing in relief]

37:18.540 --> 37:22.588
- Um, they said he could be here
on IV antibiotics for weeks.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.677
- Is there someone else
who can help you manage?

37:24.720 --> 37:26.461
Grandparents or...?

37:27.680 --> 37:30.117
- No, we're alone together,

37:31.161 --> 37:32.815
him and me.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.211
- You didn't do anything wrong,
Christie.

37:39.692 --> 37:42.347
- He needed a dentist
and I bought him a coat.

37:43.217 --> 37:46.307
And I'm supposed to know
what's best for him, but,

37:46.351 --> 37:48.788
every decision has consequences.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.532
- We don't know what they are
when we make them.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.625
You're an amazing mom.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.542
[chuckling softly]

38:04.630 --> 38:07.676
[soft music]

38:11.593 --> 38:13.465
- What was the last thing
that he said

38:13.508 --> 38:15.597
after asking
about your transcripts.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.773
- That if I needed an ally
and you weren't around,

38:17.817 --> 38:19.775
I could turn to him.

38:19.819 --> 38:23.301
- Why do you think I sent Claire
in there today?

38:23.344 --> 38:26.304
I was protecting my team,
taking responsibility.

38:26.347 --> 38:30.220
All you did by getting involved
was make things worse.
For both of us!

38:30.264 --> 38:31.744
- But you were not defending
yourself!

38:31.787 --> 38:34.355
- I told you
this was not your fight!

38:34.399 --> 38:36.575
- I know. It's yours.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.665
So why won't you fight it?

38:43.669 --> 38:45.235
[sighs]

38:50.284 --> 38:52.939
[gentle music]

38:56.246 --> 38:57.726
- Trish.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.648
They said you came through
okay.

39:08.084 --> 39:11.261
- I did this to us, Vin.
- And I let you.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.787
I knew what you were doing,
and I didn't say anything.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.876
How did we get so out of sync?

39:17.746 --> 39:19.313
- Fear?

39:20.401 --> 39:24.013
I know I was afraid of
all of this being for nothing.

39:25.841 --> 39:28.366
I had to find a way
to keep going for us.

39:30.803 --> 39:32.935
- You know, I've been
sitting here, Trish,

39:34.459 --> 39:36.852
hoping you'd survive
and thinking.

39:37.723 --> 39:41.204
We've been picking each other
up since we were kids,

39:42.902 --> 39:45.034
we can get up from this too.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.780
- Where does this leave us?

39:51.824 --> 39:54.957
- Vincent's surgeons said
12 weeks,

39:55.001 --> 39:58.874
and I could try to give you
a specific timeframe, but...

39:59.919 --> 40:02.748
You two have been beating
the odds all day.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.185
[gentle music]

40:10.059 --> 40:12.235
[sirens blaring
in the distance]

40:14.499 --> 40:16.152
- Hey.

40:16.196 --> 40:18.851
- Doctor Harris told me
about you losing your temper.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.767
- Of course she did.
Is that why you paged me?

40:21.810 --> 40:24.160
- She wasn't wrong to leave
emerg.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.467
Someone with more weight
needed her.

40:26.511 --> 40:30.123
One of the things
you learn as a boss,
even in middle management,

40:30.166 --> 40:32.081
is how to live with people
not liking you.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.040
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine with people
not liking me.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.085
You're the one who keeps telling
me that I need to politick,

40:36.129 --> 40:38.871
and delegate and what was it?
Yeah, trust them.

40:38.914 --> 40:40.960
[chuckles]
- I didn't say
it would be easy.

40:41.003 --> 40:44.224
Anyway. This is why I paged you.
Two please.

40:44.267 --> 40:47.009
- Actually, I have to get back,
Doctor Singh.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.316
- Oh, come on, it's a rite
of passage.

40:49.359 --> 40:52.754
And the dinner of overworked
doctors everywhere.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.763
Today's mistakes are over.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.118
Got any onions?

41:17.866 --> 41:21.391
- So, this would be the first
place I rented in this city

41:21.435 --> 41:23.481
with two bedrooms.

41:25.265 --> 41:27.136
[in Arabic]:

41:34.404 --> 41:36.406
- Since now.

41:37.538 --> 41:41.890
But Theo's was always going
to be temporary.

41:52.466 --> 41:56.514
- Actually, I was thinking
you could move in here,

41:56.557 --> 41:58.472
with me and Amira.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.130
[chuckles]
- The bedroom.

42:04.173 --> 42:05.653
I'll take the couch.

42:05.697 --> 42:08.134
- You just finished telling me
this is the first place

42:08.177 --> 42:10.571
you've rented with two bedrooms

42:10.615 --> 42:13.226
and you're already back
to sleeping on the couch?

42:13.269 --> 42:14.923
- I don't mind.

42:16.403 --> 42:18.361
Rania, I'm serious.

42:19.232 --> 42:21.234
- You don't think
it's a little fast?

42:21.277 --> 42:24.367
- Fast. We've already lost
so much time.

42:45.214 --> 42:47.565
- I don't need to be saved,
Bashir.

42:49.088 --> 42:51.090
- Maybe I do.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.234
[gentle music]

43:21.642 --> 43:23.601
Subtitling: difuze
