06:40.564 --> 06:42.042
about literature.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.501

wears socks with sandals

07:00.500 --> 07:01.500
Are you a teacher

07:01.501 --> 07:02.501
or a psychic?

07:03.667 --> 07:05.500
- He's right behind me,
- isn't he?

07:06.626 --> 07:09.542
Hello, Jessie!

07:09.584 --> 07:11.250
Greetings, new classmates,

07:11.292 --> 07:12.626
who I hope are mature

07:12.627 --> 07:13.959
enough not to noogie me.

07:15.417 --> 07:16.522
Ravi, you're supposed

07:16.523 --> 07:17.626
to be in school.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.210
Did some mean kids

07:19.211 --> 07:20.751
chase you here?

07:20.792 --> 07:22.751
No, silly! I have enough

07:22.752 --> 07:24.709
credits to take

07:20.792 --> 07:24.709
a college course,

07:24.751 --> 07:26.668
so my teacher suggested

07:26.669 --> 07:28.584
I take this one

07:24.751 --> 07:28.584
instead of his.

07:28.626 --> 07:29.751
But...

07:29.752 --> 07:30.876
He even drove me here.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.480
And when he dropped

07:32.481 --> 07:34.042
me off, he said,

07:30.918 --> 07:34.042
"No backsies."

07:34.083 --> 07:35.626
- What do you think
- that means?

07:35.667 --> 07:37.001
I think it means

07:37.002 --> 07:38.334
you corrected him

07:35.667 --> 07:38.334
once too often.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.959
FISK: Excuse me.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.314
If you two are done,

07:41.315 --> 07:42.626
may I begin, please?

07:42.667 --> 07:44.584
Our apologies, professor.

07:44.626 --> 07:46.313
Jessie, please do not

07:46.314 --> 07:48.000
embarrass me on

07:44.626 --> 07:48.000
the first day.

07:53.876 --> 07:56.042
Ah.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.167
Okay, the noogie line

07:57.168 --> 07:58.250
forms behind me.

08:04.459 --> 08:05.501
All quiet on

08:05.502 --> 08:06.542
the upstairs front?

08:06.584 --> 08:07.876
Finally. It is not easy

08:07.877 --> 08:09.167
tucking in a giraffe.

08:09.209 --> 08:10.418
Something's always

08:10.419 --> 08:11.626
sticking out.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.626
You know, I've rather

08:13.627 --> 08:15.584
enjoyed having

08:11.667 --> 08:15.584
Gladys here.

08:15.626 --> 08:16.689
That tall drink of water

08:16.690 --> 08:17.751
just seems to get me.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.230
Yeah, she got me, too.

08:22.231 --> 08:23.375
Right here, when I refused

08:23.417 --> 08:25.292
- to read her
- another bedtime story.

08:25.334 --> 08:27.775
- I'll tell you where - the wild things are.
- In Zuri's room!

08:28.834 --> 08:30.231
Jessie, have you

08:30.232 --> 08:31.626
finished Moby-Dick?

08:31.667 --> 08:34.210
I love Melville's abstruse

08:34.211 --> 08:36.751
and recondite prose!

08:31.667 --> 08:36.751
What do you think?

08:36.792 --> 08:38.105
I think the whale

08:38.106 --> 08:39.417
on the cover is pretty.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.333
(GASPS)

08:41.375 --> 08:42.397
I do not know

08:42.398 --> 08:43.417
which is worse.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.042
- That you have not
- done your reading,

08:45.083 --> 08:46.792
Or that you just

08:46.793 --> 08:48.500
judged a book

08:45.083 --> 08:48.500
by its cover.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.564
Jessie, Gladys snuck out

08:50.565 --> 08:52.584
of my room again

08:48.542 --> 08:52.584
to find Bertram.

08:52.626 --> 08:54.084
What is she?

08:54.085 --> 08:55.542
The world's tallest ninja?

08:55.584 --> 08:57.250
- I know this is hard
- to believe,

08:57.292 --> 08:58.855
But I think she likes

08:58.856 --> 09:00.417
him better than me.

09:00.459 --> 09:01.709
Oh, Zuri, we all liked

09:01.710 --> 09:02.959
Bertram when we first

09:00.459 --> 09:02.959
met him.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.459
Give it time.

09:07.417 --> 09:08.876
Okay, SCOBY,

09:08.877 --> 09:10.334
I know you're here.

09:11.417 --> 09:14.500
I can smell your stench.

09:14.542 --> 09:15.710
No, wait... (SNIFFS)

09:15.711 --> 09:16.876
That's me.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.751
(WHIMPERING) Ooh.

09:25.542 --> 09:26.584
(WHIMPERING)

09:27.083 --> 09:28.250
Uh-oh.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.250
(SCREAMING)

09:35.667 --> 09:37.375
- Get this off me!
- Luke?

09:39.751 --> 09:41.000
(PANTING)

09:41.834 --> 09:43.542
That thing is alive!

09:43.584 --> 09:45.314
Of course it is.

09:45.315 --> 09:47.042
It's bacteria.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.563
It just keeps breeding,

09:48.564 --> 09:50.042
and breeding,

09:50.083 --> 09:52.042
until it's everywhere.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.000
- (WHISPERING) And you can
- never escape it.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
'Kay, thanks, bye!

09:58.542 --> 10:00.584
(PANTING)

10:00.626 --> 10:02.334
Jessie! Emma's tea slime

10:02.335 --> 10:04.042
is trying to take over

10:00.626 --> 10:04.042
the world!

10:04.083 --> 10:05.500
You have to stop it!

10:05.542 --> 10:07.085
Great, I'll put slime

10:07.086 --> 10:08.626
stopping on my

10:05.542 --> 10:08.626
to-do list,

10:08.667 --> 10:09.855
right after reading

10:09.856 --> 10:11.042
20 chapters of Moby-Dick.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.292
19 of which

10:12.293 --> 10:13.500
are about blubber.

10:13.542 --> 10:15.085
Jessie, Gladys

10:15.086 --> 10:16.626
and Mrs. Kipling's

10:13.542 --> 10:16.626
tea party

10:16.667 --> 10:17.855
just went south

10:17.856 --> 10:19.042
really fast!

10:19.083 --> 10:20.292
(CRASHING)

10:20.293 --> 10:21.500
(MRS. KIPLING PURRING)

10:21.542 --> 10:22.542
(CRASHING)

10:25.667 --> 10:27.542
- I should have made
- more cookies.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.083
A-ha! I found you!

10:35.125 --> 10:36.834
Uh, was it

10:36.835 --> 10:38.542
that difficult?

10:38.584 --> 10:40.188
I can't believe

10:40.189 --> 10:41.792
you two snuck off

10:38.584 --> 10:41.792
to the park without me.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.918
Gladys, how could someone

10:43.919 --> 10:46.000
so tall stoop so low?

10:47.500 --> 10:49.438
I'm sorry, Zuri,

10:49.439 --> 10:51.375
but the truth is,

10:47.500 --> 10:51.375
Gladys prefers me.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.939
That's just because

10:52.940 --> 10:54.459
from up there,

10:51.417 --> 10:54.459
your head looks like a melon.

10:55.667 --> 10:56.876
Rude.

10:59.584 --> 11:01.063
Actually, Gladys and I

11:01.064 --> 11:02.542
happen to have a lot

10:59.584 --> 11:02.542
in common.

11:02.584 --> 11:03.792
We both listen to opera

11:03.793 --> 11:05.000
while we dust.

11:05.042 --> 11:07.459
It's kind of our thing.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.022
You have a "thing"

11:09.023 --> 11:10.542
with my giraffe?

11:10.584 --> 11:11.918
That's just disturbing.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.834
Gladys, I can't believe

11:14.835 --> 11:16.125
you dumped me.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.000
- I'm starting to feel
- like Jessie.

11:22.667 --> 11:23.792
(YAWNS)

11:24.542 --> 11:26.042
No! No, no, no.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.376
I wanna sit in the back,

11:27.377 --> 11:28.667
so Professor Fisk

11:26.083 --> 11:28.667
doesn't call on me.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.085
You did not finish

11:30.086 --> 11:31.459
the book, did you?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.105
Honestly, you are one

11:33.106 --> 11:34.709
silent but deadly away

11:31.500 --> 11:34.709
from being Luke.

11:36.584 --> 11:37.834
I didn't finish the reading

11:37.835 --> 11:39.083
because Emma's blob

11:36.584 --> 11:39.083
is after Luke,

11:39.125 --> 11:40.584
Kipling's after Gladys,

11:40.585 --> 11:42.042
Gladys is after Bertram,

11:39.125 --> 11:42.042
Zuri is after Gladys,

11:42.083 --> 11:44.334
and I'm up after midnight,

11:44.335 --> 11:46.584
wondering why I left Texas.

11:46.626 --> 11:48.187
- What did I tell you
- about the beads?

11:50.959 --> 11:52.210
This Mongolian barbecue

11:52.211 --> 11:53.459
is great!

11:53.500 --> 11:54.647
Count on nomadic people

11:54.648 --> 11:55.792
for good take-out.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.772
Nomadic... People...

11:59.773 --> 12:02.459
Take-out.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.043
Moby-Dick is one

12:05.044 --> 12:07.584
of the greatest novels

12:02.500 --> 12:07.584
of American literature,

12:07.626 --> 12:09.834
rivaled only by my novel,

12:09.835 --> 12:12.042
Gravy for My Sister,

12:12.083 --> 12:13.563
which Mom's Christmas

12:13.564 --> 12:15.042
newsletter called,

12:15.083 --> 12:17.042
"A perfect

12:17.043 --> 12:19.000
stocking stuffer,

12:15.083 --> 12:19.000
and a darn good try!"

12:21.083 --> 12:22.125
Yikes.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.125
(SNORING)

12:24.167 --> 12:25.209
Ow!

12:25.250 --> 12:27.125
Yes, Miss Prescott?

12:27.167 --> 12:29.042
- Do you have
- a comment?

12:29.083 --> 12:30.542
- What... Uh,
- yeah. Yes!

12:30.584 --> 12:33.042
I just said, "Wow!"

12:33.083 --> 12:34.813
How 'bout that symbolism?

12:34.814 --> 12:36.542
Whales, am I right?

12:38.083 --> 12:39.334
I do not think

12:39.335 --> 12:40.584
he likes you.

12:40.626 --> 12:41.626
At least he didn't

12:41.627 --> 12:42.626
drive me to another

12:40.626 --> 12:42.626
teacher's class!

12:47.667 --> 12:48.772
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

12:48.773 --> 12:49.876
Ravi?

12:49.918 --> 12:52.209
Here's your clean laundry.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.647
Oh, I see you failed

12:53.648 --> 12:55.042
to get that stain

12:55.083 --> 12:56.167
out of Mrs. Kipling's

12:56.168 --> 12:57.250
tail warmer.

12:57.292 --> 12:59.042
How many times have

12:59.043 --> 13:00.792
I told you not to feed

12:57.292 --> 13:00.792
her cabbage?

13:00.834 --> 13:02.688
What can I do?

13:02.689 --> 13:04.542
She is cuckoo for kimchi.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.167
- Look, Ravi,
- the test is tomorrow,

13:06.209 --> 13:07.709
- And even if I stay up
- all night,

13:07.751 --> 13:09.542
- I'm afraid I might not
- finish this book.

13:09.584 --> 13:11.167
- Could I possibly
- borrow your notes?

13:11.209 --> 13:12.459
No.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.272
What? But... Please?

13:14.273 --> 13:16.042
I'll be your best friend.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.022
Sadly, you are already

13:18.023 --> 13:19.959
my best friend.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.355
Let me borrow your notes,

13:21.356 --> 13:22.709
or I won't give you

13:20.000 --> 13:22.709
your underwear.

13:22.751 --> 13:24.876
Jessie, I will not rob you

13:24.877 --> 13:27.000
of the satisfaction

13:22.751 --> 13:27.000
of learning on your own.

13:27.042 --> 13:29.584
I shall go commando!

13:29.626 --> 13:31.346
- Well, that will cut down
- on the wedgies.

13:35.709 --> 13:37.292
Just what I needed.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.501
A relaxing movie

13:39.502 --> 13:41.667
to take my mind off

13:37.334 --> 13:41.667
that spooky SCOBY.

14:15.836 --> 14:17.751

14:18.960 --> 14:20.125
I'm terrible at math!

14:34.125 --> 14:36.292
Why are you afraid?

14:36.334 --> 14:38.834
SCOBY is your friend.

14:40.042 --> 14:41.897
Accept it,

14:41.898 --> 14:43.751
and you'll be happy,

14:44.167 --> 14:45.709
like me.

LUKE: Oh...

14:51.918 --> 14:54.501
Um... You got a little

14:54.502 --> 14:57.083
something right there.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.793
Isn't it a lovely

14:58.794 --> 15:00.459

15:00.500 --> 15:02.168
Soon, everyone will

15:02.169 --> 15:03.834
have one.

15:03.876 --> 15:06.000
Starting with you, Luke.

15:06.042 --> 15:08.001
Um... Thank you,

15:08.002 --> 15:09.959
but I don't even

15:06.042 --> 15:09.959
wear a watch, so...

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
This is your SCOBY.

- What did you
- do that for?

15:28.334 --> 15:30.042
- 'Cause you were
- having a nightmare.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.959
- Why didn't you just
- shake me awake?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.063
Well, then you wouldn't

15:33.064 --> 15:34.125
be wet and I wouldn't

15:32.000 --> 15:34.125
be laughing.

Bertram, Emma's

SCOBY is evil!

15:40.375 --> 15:42.209
It's gonna eat my brain!

Oh, no. Then it's still

15:44.356 --> 15:46.459
gonna be hungry.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.209
- Bertram, please
- come get Gladys!

15:48.250 --> 15:49.647
I have a test tomorrow

15:49.648 --> 15:51.042
and she keeps

15:48.250 --> 15:51.042
nuzzling my notes!

15:51.083 --> 15:53.459
That is so her.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.210
Forget the giraffe!

15:55.211 --> 15:56.918
We have to destroy

15:53.500 --> 15:56.918
the SCOBY.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.310
- Oh, we're not going
- to be doing that.

15:58.334 --> 15:59.917
Why not? Because it's

15:59.918 --> 16:01.500
too powerful?

16:01.542 --> 16:03.480
No! Because there's no

16:03.481 --> 16:05.417
such thing as

16:01.542 --> 16:05.417
a killer SCOBY!

16:05.459 --> 16:07.375
- Emma is just messing
- with you.

16:07.417 --> 16:08.855
What? Well, Jessie,

16:08.856 --> 16:10.292
did you know

16:07.417 --> 16:10.292
about this?

16:10.334 --> 16:11.355
Everyone knows!

16:11.356 --> 16:12.375
Even the giraffe

16:10.334 --> 16:12.375
was laughing.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.500
- I didn't quite finish
- the book.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.334
- The whale's gotta
- eat some people, right?

16:20.375 --> 16:22.167
- I just need a quick
- list of names.

16:22.209 --> 16:24.042
Anyone?

16:24.083 --> 16:25.438
Okay, I've passed out

16:25.439 --> 16:26.792
all your exams.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.042
I'll be over here,

16:28.043 --> 16:29.250
working on the screenplay

16:29.292 --> 16:31.792
of Gravy for My Sister,

16:31.834 --> 16:33.105
even though no one

16:33.106 --> 16:34.375
seems to be

16:31.834 --> 16:34.375
interested in it.

16:34.417 --> 16:36.459
Especially, Emma Stone,

16:36.500 --> 16:37.522
who is way too quick

16:37.523 --> 16:38.542
to call the police

16:38.584 --> 16:39.917
when you try to drop

16:39.918 --> 16:41.250
a script down

16:38.584 --> 16:41.250
her chimney.

16:43.542 --> 16:46.834
Again, yikes.

16:46.876 --> 16:48.001
Okay, uh, begin

16:48.002 --> 16:49.125
your exams now.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.083
Ugh.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.500
Oh.

16:56.542 --> 16:57.375
Sorry.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.375
No talking, please!

17:01.417 --> 17:02.730
Oh, come on!

17:02.731 --> 17:04.041
Like I would cheat

17:01.417 --> 17:04.041
on a test!

17:04.083 --> 17:05.209
Sorry, reflex from

17:05.210 --> 17:06.334
sitting next to Luke.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.209
Mr. Ross!

17:10.250 --> 17:11.396
I realize this used to be

17:11.397 --> 17:12.541
a muffler shop,

17:12.584 --> 17:13.814
but we do have

17:13.815 --> 17:15.041
a code of conduct.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.563
Talking during a test

17:16.564 --> 17:18.041
equals cheating.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.291
You get a zero.

17:19.334 --> 17:20.500
(SCREAMING)

17:20.541 --> 17:23.416
It burns! It burns!

17:25.959 --> 17:27.459
Uh, Professor Fisk,

17:27.460 --> 17:28.959
Ravi didn't do

17:25.959 --> 17:28.959
anything wrong.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.147
He's the most honest,

17:30.148 --> 17:31.292
brilliant student

17:29.000 --> 17:31.292
you'll ever teach.

17:31.334 --> 17:32.397
He doesn't need

17:32.398 --> 17:33.459
to cheat.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.272
It is true.

17:35.273 --> 17:37.042
I actually give suggestions

17:33.500 --> 17:37.042
on how to make tests harder.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.876
Yes, I am not popular.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.542
- Look, I was
- the one talking,

17:41.584 --> 17:43.022
So if anyone deserves

17:43.023 --> 17:44.459
a zero, it's me, not him.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.772
Works for me.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.042
You're off the hook.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.083
And you, please go.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.209
Well, can I get you

17:51.210 --> 17:53.292
some yummy barbecue

17:49.125 --> 17:53.292
and then come back?

17:53.334 --> 17:54.813
Nice try.

17:54.814 --> 17:56.292
But you're through

17:53.334 --> 17:56.292
for the day.

18:00.542 --> 18:01.731
Professor Fisk,

18:01.732 --> 18:02.918
I must say something!

18:02.959 --> 18:04.542
- Keep talking
- and you're out, too.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.334
- I cannot wait to read
- your book.

18:14.083 --> 18:15.500
Bad girl!

18:15.542 --> 18:16.876
(MRS. KIPLING PURRING)

18:18.083 --> 18:20.042
- LUKE: Emma!
- Not now, Luke!

18:20.083 --> 18:21.313
I'm lizard shaming

18:21.314 --> 18:22.542
Mrs. Kipling for clawing

18:20.083 --> 18:22.542
up the pillows.

18:25.042 --> 18:26.626
- LUKE: Emma!
- Get out here!

18:26.667 --> 18:28.064
Okay. But for the last time,

18:28.065 --> 18:29.459
I don't care how far

18:29.500 --> 18:30.584
you can hawk a loogie.

18:33.083 --> 18:34.083
- (GRUNTING)
- (GASPS)

18:35.459 --> 18:37.480
Wow, that loogie

18:37.481 --> 18:39.500
is huge!

18:39.542 --> 18:41.564
It's not a loogie.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.584
Your stupid SCOBY

18:39.542 --> 18:43.584
is eating me!

18:43.626 --> 18:45.250
This is horrible!

18:45.292 --> 18:46.896
Emma, think of me

18:46.897 --> 18:48.500
when you use

18:45.292 --> 18:48.500
this for tea,

18:49.584 --> 18:50.772
since you'll be

18:50.773 --> 18:51.959
drinking me.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.209
No, you'll taste disgusting!

18:57.626 --> 18:59.355
Luke, this is all

18:59.356 --> 19:01.083
my fault.

18:57.626 --> 19:01.083
I'm so sorry!

19:02.083 --> 19:03.209
Apology accepted.

19:05.751 --> 19:07.042
Gotcha!

19:09.083 --> 19:10.667
- So I got slimed
- for nothing?

19:10.709 --> 19:12.042
Mmm-hmm.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.083
(SCREAMING)

19:17.083 --> 19:19.626
Oh, no. (GRUNTS)

19:19.667 --> 19:21.459
Now I have to pee.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.667
(GROANS)

19:23.751 --> 19:25.459
Now I don't.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.042
Jessie, where's my giraffe?

19:32.083 --> 19:33.813
Oh, great.

19:33.814 --> 19:35.542
Another question

19:32.083 --> 19:35.542
I don't know the answer to.

19:35.584 --> 19:37.106
You guys, Gladys is at it

19:37.107 --> 19:38.626
again in the screening room.

19:38.667 --> 19:40.584
- Oh, no!
- I'll get the shovel.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.230
No, I mean,

19:43.231 --> 19:44.667
she's watching

19:41.792 --> 19:44.667
Out of Africa

19:44.709 --> 19:46.542
- for like,
- the tenth time.

19:46.584 --> 19:48.083
- Well, it is
- an incredible film.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.772
Meryl Streep is so

19:49.773 --> 19:51.417
great with...

19:48.125 --> 19:51.417
That's not the point!

19:51.459 --> 19:53.459
See, when we go

19:53.460 --> 19:55.459
outside to the park,

19:51.459 --> 19:55.459
Gladys seems so happy,

19:55.500 --> 19:56.813
but when I bring her

19:56.814 --> 19:58.125
back to the penthouse,

19:58.167 --> 20:00.000
- she always makes
- her sad face.

20:02.626 --> 20:04.417
- Well, that face
- is making me sad.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.126
Bertram, maybe Gladys

20:07.127 --> 20:08.542
is homesick.

20:08.584 --> 20:10.351
- You're just saying that
- because you're jealous

20:10.375 --> 20:12.042
- That she likes me
- more than you.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.083
That's not what

20:13.084 --> 20:14.084
this is about.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.042
- I just want what's
- best for Gladys.

20:16.083 --> 20:17.393
- How do you know
- what's best for her?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.375
Remember Zeebee?

20:19.417 --> 20:20.771
When I realized

20:20.772 --> 20:22.125
he was lonely

20:19.417 --> 20:22.125
for other zebras,

20:22.167 --> 20:24.042
- I sent him back
- to the zoo

20:24.083 --> 20:25.334
And now,

20:25.335 --> 20:26.584
he's really happy.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.668
Jessie, what do you

20:27.669 --> 20:28.709
think I should do?

20:28.751 --> 20:29.981
Well, if Gladys misses

20:29.982 --> 20:31.209
Africa so much,

20:31.250 --> 20:33.167
- then maybe,
- she should go home.

20:34.626 --> 20:36.063
Maybe you should go home!

20:36.064 --> 20:37.500
You and your stupid advice!

20:39.459 --> 20:41.042
Glad I could help.

20:41.083 --> 20:43.334
Jessie, I'll handle this.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.418
You just relax,

20:44.419 --> 20:45.459
and try to forget

20:45.500 --> 20:46.938
that you got a big,

20:46.939 --> 20:48.375
fat zero on your test.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.417
Sorry.

20:53.834 --> 20:57.167
Jessie, I feel terrible.

20:57.209 --> 20:58.542
- I refused to
- help you study,

20:58.584 --> 20:59.960
And yet you still

20:59.961 --> 21:01.334
supported me in class.

21:01.375 --> 21:02.696
- You're a better
- friend than I.

21:03.375 --> 21:05.459
It's okay, Ravi.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.897
The truth is,

21:06.898 --> 21:08.292
I should never have

21:05.500 --> 21:08.292
tried to go back to school.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.876
Yes, you should!

21:09.918 --> 21:11.689
I know it is difficult

21:11.690 --> 21:13.459
to wrangle four

21:09.918 --> 21:13.459
needy children...

21:13.500 --> 21:14.605
You're not that needy.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.709
I know. I was

21:13.500 --> 21:15.709
including Bertram.

21:15.751 --> 21:16.751
Oh.

21:18.334 --> 21:19.438
Therefore, I am going

21:19.439 --> 21:20.542
to put my siblings

21:20.584 --> 21:21.960
on notice that we all

21:21.961 --> 21:23.334
need to pitch in

21:20.584 --> 21:23.334
and help around here,

21:23.375 --> 21:24.418
so you will have

21:24.419 --> 21:25.459
time to study.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.772
Thank you, Ravi,

21:26.773 --> 21:28.042
but I can't go back

21:25.500 --> 21:28.042
to that class.

21:28.083 --> 21:29.876
- Professor Fisk
- hates me.

21:29.918 --> 21:31.564
Not true. I talked to him

21:31.565 --> 21:33.209
and he agreed to let you

21:29.918 --> 21:33.209
retake the test.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.313
He did?

21:34.314 --> 21:35.375
What did you

21:33.250 --> 21:35.375
say to him?

21:35.417 --> 21:36.480
I simply explained

21:36.481 --> 21:37.542
that you're taking care

21:37.584 --> 21:39.292
- of a family while
- attending school,

21:39.334 --> 21:41.292
- Was akin to Ahab's
- epic struggle

21:41.334 --> 21:42.876
- With the great
- white whale.

21:42.918 --> 21:44.209
- And that worked?
- No.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.292
Oh.

21:46.334 --> 21:47.584
I had to promise

21:47.585 --> 21:48.834
that Mr. Daddy

21:46.334 --> 21:48.834
would buy his screenplay.

21:48.876 --> 21:50.316
- Oh! Is there a part
- for me in it?

21:51.250 --> 21:52.667
- We can talk
- about that later.

21:53.792 --> 21:55.459
Thank you, Ravi.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.668
Aw, I feel really lucky

21:56.669 --> 21:57.834
to have you

21:55.500 --> 21:57.834
as a study buddy.

21:57.876 --> 21:58.898
It is I who am lucky

21:58.899 --> 21:59.918
to have you.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.835
And in the future,

22:01.836 --> 22:03.709
you are welcome

21:59.959 --> 22:03.709
to borrow all of my notes.

22:03.751 --> 22:05.417
Now, can I please

22:05.418 --> 22:07.083
have my underwear back?

22:07.125 --> 22:08.606
- Depends on how good
- the notes are.

22:12.375 --> 22:13.626
Sorry things

22:13.627 --> 22:14.876
didn't work out

22:12.375 --> 22:14.876
between us, Stretch,

22:14.918 --> 22:15.959
but I'm still gonna

22:15.960 --> 22:17.000
knit you that scarf.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.375
- It might take me
- a couple of years.

22:22.459 --> 22:23.647
Okay, Bertram,

22:23.648 --> 22:24.834
time to say goodbye.

22:24.876 --> 22:25.876
I don't wanna.

22:26.584 --> 22:28.209
Oh, come on.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.042
- You're doing
- the right thing for Gladys.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.876
And our carpets.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.814
I know. It's just that

22:33.815 --> 22:35.709
I'm gonna miss her

22:31.918 --> 22:35.709
so much.

22:35.751 --> 22:37.209
But think about

22:37.210 --> 22:38.667
how happy she'll be

22:35.751 --> 22:38.667
with all the other giraffes.

22:38.709 --> 22:40.126
And after all,

22:40.127 --> 22:41.542
you still got us.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.125
(CRYING)

22:45.584 --> 22:47.084
Okay. Well, make sure

22:47.085 --> 22:48.584
Gladys wears

22:48.626 --> 22:49.876
her neck pillow

22:49.877 --> 22:51.125
on the plane.

22:51.167 --> 22:52.334
And make sure she sits

22:52.335 --> 22:53.500
in the emergency exit row.

22:53.542 --> 22:54.751
She needs the legroom.

22:55.751 --> 22:56.876
(CRYING) Goodbye, Gladys.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.250
- Now who's gonna lick
- my head?

23:02.834 --> 23:04.042
BOTH: Not it!
