<font color="#ffff80">EVAN</font>: <i>Dear Evan Hansen...</i>

00:38.010 --> 00:41.170
<i>...today is going to
be an amazing day, </i>

00:41.300 --> 00:43.090
<i>and here's why.</i>

00:46.590 --> 00:50.760
{\an1}Because today, all you
have to do is just be yourself.

00:52.550 --> 00:55.260
{\an1}But also confident.
That's-that's important.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.260
{\an1}And interesting.
Easy to talk to.

00:57.380 --> 00:59.050
<i>Approachable. But
mostly just be yourself.</i>

00:59.170 --> 01:00.820
<i>You know, that's number
one, obviously. Be yourself.</i>

01:00.840 --> 01:02.630
<i>But, like, a confident
version of yourself, </i>

01:02.760 --> 01:04.930
<i>like, approachable
and interesting</i>

01:05.050 --> 01:06.550
<i>and not weird or
anxious or depressed.</i>

01:06.680 --> 01:08.360
{\an1}But you're not weird or
anxious or depressed.

01:08.380 --> 01:09.980
<i>I don't even know why
you're bringing it up.</i>

01:10.010 --> 01:11.150
{\an1}You can't be scared
to talk to other people.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.630
<i>You said that you'd be better.</i>

01:12.760 --> 01:13.590
{\an1}You said this year
would be different.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.760
<i>You're overthinking it.</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:16.340
<i>Do you like having no friends?</i>

01:16.470 --> 01:17.990
{\an1}All you have to do
is just be yourself.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.510
So you just didn't
eat last night?

02:46.640 --> 02:48.350
I wasn't hungry.

02:48.470 --> 02:50.010
You're a senior in high school.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.660
You need to be able to
order dinner for yourself.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.890
You can do it all online.

02:53.020 --> 02:54.720
You don't have
to talk to anybody.

02:54.850 --> 02:56.660
Okay, well, that's not, that's
not true, actually, though,

02:56.680 --> 02:58.370
because, um, the credit card's
expired, so you have to meet

02:58.390 --> 03:00.220
{\an1}the delivery person
at the door, you know?

03:00.350 --> 03:01.620
{\an1}You have to pay them
with cash at the door.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.930
You have to greet them.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.410
{\an1}You know, you have
to figure out the right,

03:04.430 --> 03:06.390
the right, um...
the-the proper greeting.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.560
Okay.

03:08.930 --> 03:10.910
This is what you're supposed
to be working on, sweetheart,

03:10.930 --> 03:12.480
with Dr. Sherman.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.730
Have you been doing those
letters he wants you to do?

03:14.850 --> 03:16.270
"Dear Evan Hansen."

03:16.390 --> 03:19.520
{\an1}I mean, I've definitely...
I-I've been trying to.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.780
Those letters are
important, honey.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.310
You have to keep working.

03:22.430 --> 03:24.930
We can't go back to where
you were last year, right?

03:25.060 --> 03:26.740
Um, you have an
appointment this afternoon.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.270
I'm working till 6:00,

03:28.390 --> 03:30.680
so you're gonna
have to take the bus.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.230
Hey.

03:32.350 --> 03:33.770
I thought you could go around

03:33.890 --> 03:36.310
and ask all the other
kids to sign your cast.

03:36.430 --> 03:37.810
Perfect icebreaker, right?

03:39.850 --> 03:42.480
- What happened to your shirt?
- There was a stain on it.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.480
- Wha... But it's brand-new.
- Yes, I know.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.640
I was... I'm so mad.

JARED</font>: Evan.

06:17.030 --> 06:18.150
What?

06:18.280 --> 06:19.610
It's Zoe Murphy

06:19.740 --> 06:22.320
in that hot band shirt
you love so much.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.850
Can you just... Can
you please stop?

06:23.900 --> 06:25.490
Well, hey, maybe
she's into you, too.

06:25.610 --> 06:27.090
Maybe you should talk to
her, tell her how you feel.

06:27.110 --> 06:28.820
I've tried talking to her.

06:28.950 --> 06:30.280
Really?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.650
Yes. Yeah, I...

06:32.780 --> 06:34.280
I stayed afterwards,
um, last year

06:34.400 --> 06:36.070
after the spring
jazz band concert,

06:36.200 --> 06:37.700
but, um, I didn't go up to her

06:37.820 --> 06:39.700
because I was worried
that my hands were sweaty.

06:39.820 --> 06:41.380
Which they weren't even,
they weren't even that sweaty.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.880
{\an1}I just... I was worried
that they were sweaty,

06:42.900 --> 06:44.510
and sometimes worrying
that they're sweaty

06:44.530 --> 06:46.170
makes them sweaty, so I
just went to the bathroom

06:46.200 --> 06:47.630
and I put 'em under,
like, the hand dryer thing,

06:47.650 --> 06:49.110
but then they were still sweaty.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.450
{\an1}They were just, um...
They were just also warm.

06:53.070 --> 06:54.860
I was kidding.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.430
You obviously
should not talk to her.

06:56.530 --> 06:57.910
You are a literal disaster.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.780
Go, Bobcats!

07:13.370 --> 07:15.240
Go, Bobcats.

07:15.370 --> 07:16.370
So awesome.

07:16.450 --> 07:18.070
So awesome, everyone.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.450
Phenomenal, really.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.910
You know what's not phenomenal?

07:22.030 --> 07:23.320
Deforestation.

07:23.450 --> 07:25.620
So, what happened
to your arm exactly?

07:25.740 --> 07:28.280
Um, I was climbing
a tree, and I fell.

07:28.410 --> 07:29.820
It was stupid.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.910
{\an1}You fell out of a tree?
What are you, five?

07:32.030 --> 07:33.820
Well, um...

07:33.950 --> 07:35.700
So, actually, I-I
worked this summer

07:35.820 --> 07:38.620
as an apprentice park
ranger at Ellison State Park.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.910
{\an1}It's a funny story,
though, because...

07:43.030 --> 07:44.930
there was, like, this solid
ten minutes after I fell

07:44.950 --> 07:46.580
where I just lay
there on the ground,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.870
{\an1}um, waiting for someone
to come get me, you know?

07:48.990 --> 07:50.580
I was like, "Any second
now." You know?

07:50.700 --> 07:52.090
{\an1}I just kept... I, like... I
was saying to myself,

07:52.120 --> 07:53.660
"Any second now.
Here they come." So...

07:53.780 --> 07:54.950
Did they?

07:55.080 --> 07:56.240
No, nobody came.

07:56.370 --> 07:59.030
That's the, um...
That's what's funny.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.370
That's not funny.

08:00.490 --> 08:01.870
Model U.N...

08:01.990 --> 08:04.280
Well, anyways, um,
how was... Did you, um...

08:04.410 --> 08:05.740
How was camp?

08:05.870 --> 08:09.450
Well, I put on 13
pounds of pure muscle.

08:09.580 --> 08:12.240
Also, I hooked up
with this Brazilian dude

08:12.370 --> 08:15.200
who is literally a supermodel.

08:16.450 --> 08:18.410
So, yeah, hope that
answers your question.

08:18.540 --> 08:22.580
So let's have Mother Nature's
back so that she'll have ours.

08:30.620 --> 08:32.539
Yeah! Yeah!

08:32.659 --> 08:34.909
All right, thank you,
Alana. Very inspirational.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.750
All right, so let's
have a great year,

08:36.870 --> 08:39.039
and, uh, go, Bobcats!

08:48.700 --> 08:51.660
Hey, um...

08:51.790 --> 08:53.250
would you want to sign my cast?

08:53.370 --> 08:54.910
Uh, you could, you
could be the first.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.830
Why would I do that?

08:57.830 --> 09:00.790
Well, I just... I thought, um,
because we're friends and...

09:00.910 --> 09:02.500
We're family friends, Evan.

09:02.620 --> 09:03.970
That's an entirely
different thing.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.460
Please respect that.

09:16.910 --> 09:18.750
Connor, I'm loving
this manicure.

09:18.870 --> 09:21.250
- Very school shooter chic.
- You're such an idiot.

09:21.370 --> 09:22.540

What? No. Not-not at all.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.470
{\an1}I'm not having this conversation

22:56.590 --> 22:59.510
- in front of our guest.
- No, tell us the good things.

22:59.630 --> 23:01.260
What were the good things?

23:01.380 --> 23:03.130
- Family day at Sunny Glen?
- <font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: Zoe!

23:03.260 --> 23:04.590
This is not the time.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.120
Who knew rehab
could be so much fun?

23:06.220 --> 23:07.550
There were good things.

23:08.380 --> 23:11.260
I'm not the only one.

23:11.380 --> 23:12.630
You remember, right?

23:16.590 --> 23:17.590
Right.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.010
Of course.

23:19.130 --> 23:20.680
Yes, of course there
were good things.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.510
Tell us something.

23:23.630 --> 23:24.840
Please, Evan.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.630
Right, um...

23:30.760 --> 23:32.590
S... Uh, Connor and I...

23:34.130 --> 23:36.380
Uh, I d... I don't know, um...

23:38.430 --> 23:40.140
We had a really great...

23:40.260 --> 23:43.180
we had a really great
time together, um...

23:43.300 --> 23:45.050
this one day recently.

23:45.180 --> 23:49.090
{\an1}That's something good,
um, that I remember.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.590
That day.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.300
Um...

23:52.430 --> 23:54.680
Yeah, that awesome day at the...

23:55.640 --> 23:57.470
...um, trees.

23:59.550 --> 24:01.640
- Trees?
- Never mind, never mind.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.470
I'm sorry, I don't, I don't... I
shouldn't have said anything,

24:04.590 --> 24:06.270
and I-I knew it was
stupid, so I'm sorry...

24:06.340 --> 24:07.700
You don't mean
the orchard, do you?

24:10.970 --> 24:13.300
He took you to
the apple orchard?

24:13.430 --> 24:15.390
- When?
- Uh, once.

24:15.510 --> 24:16.800
Just-just once. That once.

24:16.930 --> 24:19.430
I thought that place
closed years ago.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.570
Well, the hiking trails are
still open though, aren't they?

24:21.600 --> 24:24.050
We used to go to the
orchard all of the time.

24:24.180 --> 24:25.890
We'd do picnics there.

24:26.010 --> 24:27.680
Do you remember that, Zoe?

24:27.810 --> 24:29.350
Yeah, I do.

24:29.470 --> 24:31.890
And you and Connor
would fly that little toy plane

24:32.010 --> 24:34.060
until you crashed
it into the creek.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.180
That was an emergency landing.

24:37.310 --> 24:40.140
I can't believe that
he took you there.

24:40.260 --> 24:42.140
I bet you had fun.

24:42.260 --> 24:45.180
I bet the two of you... I...

24:45.310 --> 24:47.220
I bet that was fun.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.510
Yeah.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.390
We did. We did.

24:52.510 --> 24:53.390
The whole day.

24:53.510 --> 24:56.390

29:55.620 --> 29:58.240
Thank you, Evan.

29:58.370 --> 30:01.280
{\an1}Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.580
I mean, they think
you were lovers.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.580
- You realize that, right?
- Oh, my God.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.220
{\an1}I thought you were
gonna tell them the truth.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.780
I-I-I tried, but then I just...

30:11.910 --> 30:13.370
I got nervous and
I started talking.

30:13.490 --> 30:14.910
And then once
I started, I just...

30:15.030 --> 30:16.780
Couldn't stop.

30:16.910 --> 30:18.410
They didn't want me to stop.

30:18.530 --> 30:20.410
What else did you say to them?

30:20.540 --> 30:22.430
Uh, his mom thinks that we
wrote emails to each other.

30:22.450 --> 30:23.870
Oh, perfect.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.830
{\an1}Sh-She thinks he had,
like, secret accounts.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.790
Ha, yes. Secret email accounts.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.580
That's what all the
cool kids are doing.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.120
Hansen! Kalwani!

30:31.240 --> 30:32.410

30:32.540 --> 30:34.700
{\an1}- No, thank you.
- What was that?

30:34.830 --> 30:37.740
I said thank you for
the encouragement!

30:37.870 --> 30:38.870
Fascist.

30:38.990 --> 30:40.740
She wants to see the emails.

30:40.870 --> 30:43.180
And now you want me to make
a bunch of fake emails for you.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.700
- Classic.
- You know how to do that?

30:44.830 --> 30:47.080
{\an1}- It's simple coding.
- But you failed coding.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.040
If you consider
a D-minus failing.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.540
Just so we're clear,

30:50.660 --> 30:51.970
{\an1}I charge a minimum
of two grand per email,

30:52.000 --> 30:53.180
and that is a
floor, not a ceiling.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.790
{\an1}- $2,000?
- 500.

30:54.910 --> 30:56.190
I didn't even ask for your help.

30:56.250 --> 30:57.730
250, bottom line.
Take it or leave it.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.290

give you 20 bucks.

30:59.410 --> 31:01.310

I can't remember the last

{\an1}but the two of them,
if you read these...

34:40.590 --> 34:42.380
I think if you could
take ten minutes

34:42.510 --> 34:44.260
{\an1}and actually read
these emails...

34:44.380 --> 34:46.510
I'm looking at them right now.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.300
Zoe. Look what Evan sent us.

34:51.429 --> 34:53.719
They're emails
from your brother.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.010
I printed them out.

34:55.139 --> 34:57.340
Oh. Take that, trees.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.090
{\an1}- How was school?
- Terrific.

34:59.220 --> 35:01.050
All of a sudden,
people I've never met

35:01.180 --> 35:02.640
want to be my best friend.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.180
I'm the dead kid's
sister, didn't you know?

35:06.180 --> 35:07.470
I'm sure they mean well.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.640
I'm sure they don't.

35:16.260 --> 35:18.050
She needs time.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.680
No, Larry, she
needs her parents.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.930
Enjoy the game.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.720
Can I come in?

35:35.850 --> 35:37.140
Oh.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.720
You don't have to stop playing.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.600
How was band?

35:45.470 --> 35:48.510
You know, he-he talks
about you playing guitar,

35:48.640 --> 35:52.140
in one of his emails, at
the spring concert last year.

35:52.260 --> 35:53.970
Really?

35:54.100 --> 35:55.100
{\an1}Yeah.

35:55.140 --> 35:58.850
Does he, does he talk about

35:58.970 --> 36:01.180
when he disappeared
for two days?

36:01.310 --> 36:04.010
But then he called me and
asked me to come pick him up.

36:04.140 --> 36:05.470
He wanted to come home,

36:05.600 --> 36:07.140
{\an1}but he wasn't ready
to talk to you yet,

36:07.260 --> 36:10.180
so I took the bus all the
way downtown to get him,

36:10.310 --> 36:12.810
and guess what.

36:15.810 --> 36:18.390
All he really wanted was money.

36:21.220 --> 36:25.270
And I gave it to him
because I was 12.

36:27.930 --> 36:29.930
He was struggling.

36:32.310 --> 36:34.600
How about the time he tried
to punch through my door,

36:34.730 --> 36:36.230
screaming at the
top of his lungs,

36:36.350 --> 36:39.100
saying he was gonna
kill me for no reason?

36:39.230 --> 36:41.310
Is that email in there?

36:43.100 --> 36:45.180
We're all grieving
in our own way.

36:52.390 --> 36:56.060
You might consider reading
these when you're ready.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.690

more than you think.

{\an1}um, about that boy

42:12.500 --> 42:13.700
Connor Murphy?

42:27.330 --> 42:29.750

I'm just a phone call away

43:25.000 --> 43:28.250
{\an1}and to remember Connor
and celebrate who he was.

43:29.460 --> 43:30.820
Would you want to
speak or perform?

43:30.920 --> 43:32.670
I didn't really
know him. I'm sorry.

43:32.790 --> 43:34.710
- That's okay.
- Bye.

43:47.130 --> 43:48.210
Want a wristband?

43:48.340 --> 43:50.710
Oh, yes. Yeah. Okay.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.040
Thank you.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.590
{\an1}You were friends
with him, right?

43:58.290 --> 44:00.170
I saw him sign your
cast in the library,

44:00.290 --> 44:02.750
and you started
arguing about something.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.460
- Were you friends with him?
- We weren't close.

44:06.590 --> 44:09.210
We presented together o-on
Huck Finn in the tenth grade,

44:09.340 --> 44:12.130
{\an1}but he probably
didn't tell you that.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.960
Um, no, no, I didn't know.

44:14.090 --> 44:16.170
I always really liked him.

44:16.300 --> 44:17.800
It seemed like he
didn't really care

44:17.920 --> 44:20.000
what anyone else thought, and...

44:20.130 --> 44:21.630
I thought that was
pretty remarkable.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.880
Well, I'm putting together
a memorial for him

44:28.010 --> 44:30.090
at school on Friday.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.510
If you wanted to do something...

44:31.630 --> 44:34.050
Oh. Um...

44:34.170 --> 44:36.300
Sorry, I-I...

44:36.420 --> 44:39.880
I-I probably w-would
rather not, if that's okay.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.010
Yeah, sure.

44:41.130 --> 44:43.460
If you change your mind...

44:43.590 --> 44:44.800
just text me.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.670
<font color="#ffff80">EVAN</font>: Okay.

My mom realized we
were out of ice cream,

45:39.380 --> 45:41.220
so they went to go get more.

45:42.220 --> 45:44.130
Did you park in the driveway?

45:44.260 --> 45:46.680
'Cause if you park on
the street, they'll ticket you.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.590
The people in this
neighborhood are monsters.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.800
{\an1}Um, no, I didn't,
I didn't, um...

45:50.930 --> 45:52.800
I took the bus. My mom
needed the car for work.

45:52.930 --> 45:54.890
- What about your dad?
- My dad.

45:55.010 --> 45:57.510
Um, he lives in Colorado, so...

45:57.640 --> 45:59.680
He left when I was seven.

46:02.340 --> 46:03.800
That sucks.

46:05.050 --> 46:08.430
Mine died when I was one, so...

46:08.550 --> 46:09.800
I sort of win.

46:10.930 --> 46:12.840
{\an1}- Sorry.
- Thanks.

46:12.970 --> 46:14.510
It's fine.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.550
I-I don't even really
remember him, to be honest.

46:17.680 --> 46:20.470
Connor did, though, a little.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.430
That's terrible.

46:22.550 --> 46:23.970
Yeah.

46:24.100 --> 46:27.720
And then Larry showed
up, fixed everything.

46:29.180 --> 46:31.140
For a while, at least.

46:31.260 --> 46:32.970
Yeah.

46:33.100 --> 46:35.640
Most people, with Connor,
they just would've been like,

46:35.760 --> 46:40.180
"See ya," but he's the only
dad we ever really knew, so...

46:41.850 --> 46:43.800
Wow, your mom... I
didn't, I didn't realize.

46:43.930 --> 46:45.390
Yeah, well.

46:45.510 --> 46:47.760
She's in total denial now.

46:47.890 --> 46:49.260
So is Larry.

46:49.390 --> 46:50.910
I mean, he didn't
even cry at the funeral.

46:50.930 --> 46:52.010
I'm sorry.

46:53.220 --> 46:55.680
{\an1}Not as sorry as you're gonna be.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.560
- Oh, is-is that the...
- Mm-hmm.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.930
Gluten-free apple pie? You bet.

47:03.060 --> 47:04.510
It-it looks...

47:06.180 --> 47:07.890
{\an1}Inedible?

47:08.020 --> 47:09.470
It is.

47:10.560 --> 47:13.430
Just be glad we get
to have real ice cream.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.430
My mom was Buddhist last year,

47:15.560 --> 47:17.180
{\an1}so we couldn't have
any animal products.

47:17.310 --> 47:19.770
She was B... um, Buddhist
last year but not this year?

47:19.890 --> 47:22.100
Yep. That's sort
of what she does.

47:22.220 --> 47:23.930
She gets into a lot
of different things.

47:24.060 --> 47:27.180
- Mm.
- For a while, it was Pilates.

47:27.310 --> 47:29.060
<i>The Secret.</i>

47:29.180 --> 47:31.180
Buddhism. Et cetera.

47:31.310 --> 47:33.450
It's cool that she's interested
in so much different stuff.

47:33.470 --> 47:34.770
Yeah, she's not, though.

47:34.890 --> 47:36.770
That's just what
happens when you're rich

47:36.890 --> 47:37.890
and you don't have a job.

47:37.970 --> 47:39.100
You get a little crazy.

47:39.230 --> 47:40.430
Well, my mom always says

47:40.560 --> 47:42.180
it's better to be
rich than poor, so...

47:42.310 --> 47:43.870
Yeah, well, your mom's
probably never been rich, then.

47:43.890 --> 47:45.480
Yeah, you've probably
never been poor.

47:47.850 --> 47:49.200
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just said that.

47:49.230 --> 47:50.520
I'm so sorry.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.600
Wow. I didn't realize

47:52.730 --> 47:54.980
you were capable of saying
something that wasn't nice.

47:55.100 --> 47:56.770
{\an1}I'm n... I'm not.
I'm really sorry.

47:56.890 --> 47:59.230
You really don't have
to keep saying that.

47:59.350 --> 48:01.180
{\an1}Okay.

48:01.310 --> 48:03.430
You want to say it again.

48:03.560 --> 48:04.850
Yeah, very much so, I do.

48:11.850 --> 48:14.310
Why did he write that...

48:14.440 --> 48:15.690
in his note?

48:15.810 --> 48:17.980
"Because there's Zoe.

48:18.100 --> 48:21.440
And I don't even know her,
but if I could just talk to her..."

48:24.060 --> 48:26.190
Honestly, I really don't know.

48:26.310 --> 48:28.810
{\an1}What does any of that
even mean? I mean...

48:28.940 --> 48:31.100
We weren't close at all.

48:31.230 --> 48:33.560
Not since we were kids.

48:33.690 --> 48:35.650
He never noticed
anything about me.

48:35.770 --> 48:38.190
{\an1}That's not true.
That's not true.

48:38.310 --> 48:40.440
He-he-he noticed a
lot of things about you.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.190
Like what things?

48:52.310 --> 48:53.400
Right.

48:53.520 --> 48:54.400
No, no, no.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.520
That's, um...

48:56.650 --> 48:57.730
Well...

48:57.850 --> 48:59.610
Okay, w... Okay.

48:59.730 --> 49:02.020
Here's something. Um...

49:02.150 --> 49:05.690
{\an1}Whenever you have,
uh, a solo in-in jazz band,

49:05.810 --> 49:07.940
{\an1}you just... you close your e...

49:08.060 --> 49:09.500
you probably don't even
know you're doing this,

49:09.520 --> 49:12.020
{\an1}but you close your eyes,
um, and you get, like...

49:12.150 --> 49:13.730
I don't know, it's
like a half smile,

49:13.860 --> 49:15.580
like you just heard the
funniest thing in the world,

49:15.610 --> 49:17.000
but it's a secret and you
can't tell anyone about it.

49:17.020 --> 49:18.690
But then...

49:18.810 --> 49:20.790
uh, the way that you smile,
it's sort of like you are...

49:20.810 --> 49:23.480
{\an1}you're letting us in
on the secret, too.

49:23.610 --> 49:25.270

55:02.710 --> 55:04.590

55:06.630 --> 55:09.300
Yes, right, because we
have so much in common.

55:09.420 --> 55:10.500
What?

55:11.500 --> 55:13.250
Well, you're,
like, the president

55:13.380 --> 55:15.130
of a m-million different
groups at school,

55:15.250 --> 55:17.130
and you're, like, part
of every single activity.

55:17.250 --> 55:20.590
And you're, you know, and I'm...

55:20.710 --> 55:22.500
um, I am not.

55:29.050 --> 55:31.300

55:31.420 --> 55:33.420
I'm on Lexapro, ten milligrams.

55:35.710 --> 55:37.170
Oh.

55:38.800 --> 55:42.210

55:55.010 --> 55:56.260
Yeah.

55:57.210 --> 55:59.300
Yeah, me, too.

56:01.340 --> 56:03.260

56:07.590 --> 56:10.010

- Yeah.

56:11.670 --> 56:14.260
{\an1}You know, you don't
really act like a...

56:15.470 --> 56:17.170
...depressed sort of person.

56:17.300 --> 56:21.170
I'm just good at

56:23.420 --> 56:24.670

Yeah, so it's a student group

dedicated to keeping
Connor's memory alive.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.480
Um, making sure
people that need help,

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.150
they have somewhere they can go.

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:20.560
I didn't realize Connor
meant this much to people.

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.690
{\an1}Well, it's all... I mean,
it was all Alana's idea.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:24.000
She thought of the whole thing.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.360
That's the young woman

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.480
who organized the
memorial tomorrow.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:30.020
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, she seems like...

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:31.940
- quite a force.
- Yeah.

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:34.320
Um, anyways, um...

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.150
we just wanted to do something.

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:39.020
It's-it's r-really cool.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.610

We still haven't decided
what to do with, um, everything.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.320
Oh, um... he used
to write songs.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.940
Or at least he told us he did.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:10.110
He refused to play
for us, so who knows?

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:14.480
He never played any for you?

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.110
No, he di... he didn't.

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:19.280

It's a...

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.900
When Connor
entered seventh grade,

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:45.320
all of my girlfriends said,

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.280
"Here it comes,
Bar Mitzvah season.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.240
He's gonna have a different
party every Saturday."

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.400
{\an1}And Larry was so excited
to take him shopping.

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:55.150
He dragged him
to Brooks Brothers,

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.400
and they picked out a
suit, some shirts and this tie.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:02.860
He looked... just like his dad.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.700
{\an1}He never got invited
to a single party.

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:19.700
{\an1}He was such a sweet
boy underneath it all.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.490
Everything just hurt too much.

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:31.030
I thought that, uh, you could
wear this to the memorial.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.740
For your speech.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.570
Oh, I'm not... I-I...

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.530
I wasn't... I'm-I'm
not speaking.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.240
Why not?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.780
Well, I... I just
don't think, um...

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:49.070
I mean, most
people think that I'm...

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.490
...not that cool of a person,

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:54.320
so nobody wants to hear from me.

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.320
Well, if...

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:02.450
that's what most people think...

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.120
...it sounds like most people
don't know you very well.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.950
They didn't know Connor either.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.330
They never bothered.

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:14.910
Hmm.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.780

I would like to say a

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.000
...about my friend...

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:16.000
...my best friend,
Connor Murphy.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.210
Holy shit.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.980
I would like to tell you about
the day that Connor and I

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.370
went hiking behind the old
Autumn Smile Apple Orchard.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.040
We found a huge oak tree.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:29.310
Connor said that he wondered
what the world would look like

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:33.130
from all the way up there,
so we decided to find out.

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:38.580
We started climbing slowly.

01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:40.540
And then, when I
finally looked back,

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.460
we were already 30
feet off the ground.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.630
Um, Connor just looked at me...

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.840
...and smiled that
way he always did.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.090
Um, and then...

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.710
Um...

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.250
Sorry. Then I fell.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.460
I-I lay there on
the ground and...

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:09.880
Good morning,

think drove me to urgent care

01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:39.720
and-and waited there with me?

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.590
You were at work. You remember?

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.070
I couldn't even... You didn't,
you didn't answer your phone.

01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:44.670
You-you told me that
your boss took you.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.300
Well, so I lied, obviously.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:48.930
So when were you planning
on telling me any of this?

01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:50.690
When would I tell you exactly?
When are you even here?

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.050
- I'm here now.
- Okay.

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:57.380
You know, I-I-I talked to
Dr. Sherman, and he told me

01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:58.990
- you've been skipping appointments.
- I missed one.

01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:00.970
You know those aren't free.

01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:08.640
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.930
I'm...

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.340
I'm so happy you had
a friend, sweetheart.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.510
I'm sorry he's gone.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.510
I just wish I'd known.

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.550
That speech you gave, it...

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.390
I don't even know
what to say. I'm...

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.640
I'm proud of you.

01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:39.890
Thanks.

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:56.430
Hi.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.140
This is a cool surprise.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.930
Um...

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:06.050
Can I get you anything or...?

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.850
Just water.

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:11.310
{\an1}- Just water? You're sure?
- Yeah. That's perfect.

01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:13.390
Coming up.

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:19.060
<font color="#ffff80">ZOE</font>: Where's your mom?

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:21.930
She works late on Fridays.

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.220
Oh. I wanted to meet her.

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:26.810
Yeah, that would've been great.

01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:31.680
What's this?

01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:33.560
Oh, it's just my mom is obsessed

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.720
with these college
scholarship essay contests.

01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:38.030
I mean, I'd-I'd-I'd have to
win probably, like, all of them

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:41.810
to actually pay
for college, so...

01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:45.470
Your parents,
they-they can't...?

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.560
Uh, not really.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.310
I'm sorry.

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.270
Is your room upstairs?

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:07.560
Yeah. It's, um...

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.390
Yeah.

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:21.480
Yeah, so it's, like, a pretty
standard sort of room, I guess.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.890
So...

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:24.850
Hey. Oh, um...

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.680
actually, I meant to
tell you this before.

01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:29.310
{\an1}Um, so Alana and I
had a really good...

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:33.310
{\an1}Um, we had a really
good meeting this morning,

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.440
{\an1}and I think that...
y-you probably noticed,

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.270
um, that, uh, you know, a
lot of people were giving,

01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:41.020
uh, during that first week,
which is definitely great,

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.480
but, um, it sort of slowed
down a bit, obviously.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.950
But Alana and I
are really confident

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:46.340
that it's gonna
pick right back up.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.650
I think it's just a
m... a matter of...

01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:51.980
{\an1}Can I talk to you
about something?

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.060
Yes.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.100
Uh...

01:22:03.230 --> 01:22:05.600
The Connor Project
is... awesome.

01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:08.480
It's-it's really, really cool.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.850
Oh.

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:13.350
- Thank you.
- It's just that, my whole life,

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.980
everything has been about him.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.610
And maybe the two of us...

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.560
...maybe we don't have to talk
about my brother all the time.

01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:24.900
Maybe we can...

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.400
talk about other things.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.900
I like you.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:44.150
And it's not because you
were friends with my brother

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:46.150
or because of The
Connor Project.

I'm famous for doing that.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.100
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: I've been
told that many times.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.000
HEIDI</font>: Mm-hmm.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.000
Hi, honey.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.460
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: Come join us.

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.870
- I just put dinner in the oven.
- Hi.

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.680
She made me swear
to keep it a surprise.

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:20.960
I'm surprised.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.250
Hi.

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.870
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.460
{\an1}- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.120
Yeah, uh, great.

01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:29.120
{\an1}It's great.

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:30.790
Come on, Evan. Sit.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:34.710
I-I thought that you
were working tonight.

01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:36.920
<font color="#ffff80">HEIDI</font>: Cynthia called
and invited me for dinner,

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.790
so, you know, I'm playing hooky.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.080
We were just discussing how
sneaky you and Connor were.

01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:43.670
<font color="#ffff80">HEIDI</font>: I had no idea that he
and Connor were even friends.

01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:45.170
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: Oh, we were the same.

01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.810
CYNTHIA</font>: You know,
boys love their secrets.

01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:48.710
{\an1}Something smells
good. What's for dinner?

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.540
Oh, it's chicken
Milanese, your favorite.

01:27:50.670 --> 01:27:52.500
Oh, actually his favorite is

01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:53.980
my great-grandmother's
black beans.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.080
Really?

01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:56.490
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: Well, he's the only one

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:57.810
{\an1}that appreciates
my cooking, so...

01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:59.310
- That's not true.
- Uh, another drop?

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:01.380
Oh, no, no. I'm-I'm
fine. Thank you.

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.830
Oh, um, fascinating
story about the wine.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.540
It's from a vineyard in Napa,

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:09.630
and the entire growing
process from start to finish,

01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:11.540
100% sustainable.

01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:13.000
Is that right?

01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:15.460
Not to mention, it
tastes good, too.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.710
- Mm-hmm. It does.
- Mm.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.090
You know, I-I
didn't realize, uh...

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:20.490
{\an1}Cynthia and Larry
were telling me

01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:22.130
that you spend
so much time here.

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:23.930
{\an1}Yeah, I... you've been
working a lot, so...

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:26.000
Why did I think
you were at Jared's?

01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:27.500
I-I don't know.

01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:28.960
<font color="#ffff80">ZOE</font>: Evan was showing me

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:32.210
{\an1}all of those scholarship
contests that you found.

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.380
It's really impressive.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.170
Well, Evan is a great writer.

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:37.800
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: Well, that does not

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.340
surprise me at all.

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.710
His English teacher last
year told me that he wrote

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.170
{\an1}one of the best papers
she'd ever read on <i>Sulu.</i>

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.300
Is that right?

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.670
- It's <i>Sula.</i>
- What?

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.170
You said "Sulu." It's <i>Sula.</i>

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.250
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: Yeah, I believe Sulu's

01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.170
a character on <i>Star Trek.</i>

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.170
My mistake.

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.090
So, speaking of scholarships...

01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:06.420
Oh, right, uh...

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:08.710
Yeah, well, I guess...

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.090
now's as good a time as any.

01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:14.300
Uh...

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.630
Cynthia, do you want to...?

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:17.630
Hmm.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.710
Well, um...

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.340
Zoe happened to mention that
Evan was having some difficulty

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:27.130
in terms of the financial
burden of college.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:30.550
{\an1}And Larry and I
started thinking,

01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:32.380
and we've been fortunate enough

01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:34.720
to set some money
aside for Connor.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.920
Um, I'm good.

01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:41.720
- I'm okay.
- Yeah.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.180
Heidi, with your blessing,
we would like to give Evan

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:45.930
the money that we
set aside for our son

01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:49.970
so he can fulfill his dreams.

01:29:55.630 --> 01:29:58.050
Thank you so much...

01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.800
but we're gonna be fine.

01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:02.220
I don't have a lot of
money, but I-I do have some.

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.840
Oh.

01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:05.650
No, no, no, no, no. I
didn't mean to intimate...

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.050
No, no, I understand, but,
um, we do have money,

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.630
so I'm sorry you were under
the impression that we didn't.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.880
And whatever
money we don't have,

01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:16.890
Evan will either
make up for with a job

01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:18.550
or he'll get a scholarship.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.470
I don't want my son to
get the idea that it's okay

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:23.010
to rely on other
people for favors.

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.930
- Well, it's not a favor.
- No.

01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:27.220
But as his mother, I
need to set that example.

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.260
You can't expect
things from strangers.

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.220
Oh, we're not strangers.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.590
No, of course not.

01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:36.470
But you're not family either.

01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:45.550
Mom, just hold on.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.430
No, I think I
better get to work,

01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:49.220
see if I can grab a
shift now that I know

01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:51.300
{\an1}how concerned you
are about our finances.

01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:52.820
Mom, will you please
come back inside?

01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:54.760
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:57.010
Will you just come
back inside, please?

01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.050
They think you're
their son, these people.

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.180
They're not "these people."

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.550
They don't really know you.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.600
Well, they like
me. They like me.

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.320
I know that that's very
hard for you to believe,

01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:07.720
that they don't think I'm...

01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:09.280
{\an1}you know, that there's
something wrong with me,

01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:10.740
{\an1}that I need to be,
like, fixed, like you do.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.560
- When have I ever said that?
- Oh, my God.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.990
{\an1}Mom, I-I have to
go to therapy, right?

01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:15.330
I have to take
drugs. I have to...

01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:16.950
There's-there's
nothing wrong with that.

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.320
There-There's nothing wrong
with needing help, honey.

01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:19.410
Just stop. I know that there is,

01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:20.890
and I know that I'm a burden,

01:31:21.010 --> 01:31:22.490
that I'm the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:23.530
{\an1}and I just... well, I just
ruined your life, okay?!

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:26.470
No. You are the best thing.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.810
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:32.310
I'm sorry I can't give you
anything more than that.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.850
It's not my fault if
other people can.

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:44.180
I'll see you at home.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.180
Hi.

01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:59.030
I'm so sorry. I meant
to be there yesterday.

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:02.310
Okay, well, we have two days
left, and we're $25,000 short.

01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:04.310
Yeah, I just... Everything...

01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:05.930
You're right. I know. I'm sorry.

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.640
Things have been
really busy, so...

01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:11.430
I've been wondering something.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.310
Mm-hmm?

01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:16.060
Were you ever actually
friends with him?

01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:19.390
What are you talking about?

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.020
Well, the thing about
the emails, it's just that,

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:23.980
{\an1}like, you and Connor
keep talking about

01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:25.690
climbing this tree
together in June.

01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:26.810
Mm-hmm?

01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:29.100
We were in school in June.

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.270
You didn't have a
cast until September.

01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:34.060
Well, uh, you know what?

01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:36.040
We probably just wrote down
the wrong date or something.

01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:39.480
It's not just the emails, Evan.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.940
{\an1}You've missed, like,
three meetings in a row.

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.850
If I were his best friend,

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.750
I would be doing everything
I could to make sure

01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:47.370
{\an1}his dream of rebuilding
the orchard came true.

01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:49.020
Okay.

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.870
{\an1}Look, it's terrible that
people aren't giving

01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:52.520
as much money as
we hoped they would.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.940
It is, but-but it's
not like it's him.

01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:56.310
You know what I mean?

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.350

an orchard, Alana.

prove Connor wrong.

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:14.150
{\an1}And if the orchard is
just an empty promise,

01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:17.310
all of those people will
know that Connor was right.

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.440
That no one cares.

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.480

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.860
Did I lie to all these people?

Just go to your email.

Another email?

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.820
It's not...

it doesn't matter.

01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:55.730
CYNTHIA</font>: That's it.
I'm calling the police.

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.810
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: No, look, right now,
maybe the best thing to do

01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.590
is to just stay calm, all right?

01:39:58.710 --> 01:39:59.050
And sit...

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.480
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: That's always
your solution, isn't it?

01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:01.900
Wait and see. Let's just
wait and see, right, Larry?

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.060
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: What are
the police going to do?

01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:04.300
It's the Internet. Wh...

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.920
Are they gonna
arrest the Internet?

01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:07.150
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: I had to beg
you, every step of the way,

01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:08.270
for-for therapy, for-for rehab.

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.920
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: What? N-No, no.

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:11.820
You went lurching from
one miracle cure to the next...

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.420
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: Oh, you're... Really?

01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:15.480
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: ...because all he
needed was another $20,000

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:16.510
weekend yoga retreat.

01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:17.960
What was your alternative,

01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:19.520
{\an1}other than picking apart
everything that I did?

01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:21.460
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: How about putting him on

01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:23.210
one program and sticking to it?

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:25.130
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: Remember what he said

01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:27.220
the first time that Connor
tried to kill himself?

01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:28.900
- That he's just looking for attention.
- For Christ's sake.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.420
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: He just
wants attention!

01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:32.230
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: I'm not gonna
sit here and defend myself!

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:33.690
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: You
couldn't understand him.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.670
{\an1}You never understood him
because he wasn't yours!

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.840
Mom, what the hell?

01:40:38.970 --> 01:40:40.780
I raised him from the time
he was three years old.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.400
He was getting better, and
you refused to see it. Ask Evan.

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.260
Tell them, Evan.

01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:46.050
Evan did everything
that he could.

01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:48.970
{\an1}Evan? Evan was in denial
of what was happening.

01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:50.760
<font color="#ffff80">ZOE</font>: Do not bring him into this.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.060
<font color="#ffff80">CYNTHIA</font>: Read the note, Larry.

01:40:52.090 --> 01:40:53.590
Read what he said.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.630
<i>"I just wish that
everything was different."</i>

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.550
LARRY</font>: <i>I tried.</i>

01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.190
- But he was my son!
- <font color="#ffff80">He wanted to be better! - ZOE</font>: Please.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.340
<font color="#ffff80">LARRY</font>: I-I tried everything!

01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:02.010
<font color="#ffff80">ZOE</font>: Stop it! Just please stop!

01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:04.430
- Please stop fighting!
- He was trying to be better!

01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:05.430
He was trying!

01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:07.010
And he was failing.

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.260
We failed him.

01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.720
No, you didn't. No, you didn't.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.970
You didn't fail him.

01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.430
Read the note.

01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.970
He didn't write it.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.050
I wrote it.

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:30.550
You didn't write
Connor's suicide note.

01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:35.260
{\an1}Um, it was an assignment
from my therapist.

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:37.300
Write a letter to
yourself, um, a pep talk.

01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:39.450
"Evan Hansen, Dear Evan
Hansen, today's gonna be a good day.

01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:41.150
{\an1}- Here's why."
- I-I don't, I don't think that...

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.950
I was supposed to bring it
to my appointment with me,

01:41:42.970 --> 01:41:45.150
but Connor took it, and then
I guess he must have had it

01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:47.050
with him, um...

01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:51.600
...when you found him, so...

01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:57.850
What are you saying?

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.140
We weren't friends.

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.640

That you felt...

01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:40.090
I didn't know.

01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:44.260
I lied.

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:50.510
I lied about so many things.

01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:55.220
Not just Connor. Um...

01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:02.260
So, last summer, um...

01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:06.510
...I just...

01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:11.630
...I just felt so alone. Um...

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:16.180
You can tell me.

01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:21.010
The tree.

01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:26.050
I didn't fall.

01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.390
I let go.

01:52:34.590 --> 01:52:36.840
- Oh, Evan.
- Do you hate me now?

01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:42.720
You should. You should.

01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:47.220
If you knew who I am,
just how just broken I am.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.090
I already know you.

01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:52.840
And I love you.

01:52:58.890 --> 01:53:00.970
I can promise you that...

01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:04.850
...someday...

01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:09.390

01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:15.390
Ah.

01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:18.890

When do you leave for college?

02:04:33.010 --> 02:04:37.510
{\an1}Um, actually I decided
to take a year off, so...

02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:39.350
Uh, just try to save some money.

02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:41.060
Get a job.

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.720
Uh... take some time.

02:04:44.850 --> 02:04:47.180
{\an1}So, I'm taking classes
at the community college.

02:04:47.310 --> 02:04:50.180
I'll have credits to
transfer in the fall, so...

02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:52.350
That's smart.

02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:54.350
{\an1}Yeah. We'll see.

02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:00.270

02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:03.310
Even though...

02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:07.020
This is my first time.

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.180

02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:17.350
My parents come
here all the time.

02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:20.680
We do picnics,
like, every weekend.

02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:23.680
Lots of gluten-free sandwiches.

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:29.560
It's helped them
a lot, actually.

02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:32.230

02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:39.930

02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:43.520
...I can't even...

02:05:47.690 --> 02:05:50.850

02:05:58.190 --> 02:06:00.230

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:14.690
I should probably...

02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:16.190
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:18.190
Of course.

02:06:20.650 --> 02:06:22.310
Hey, can I just...

02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:25.400
Can I just ask you...

02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:28.940
Why did you want to meet here?

02:06:35.230 --> 02:06:37.690
