16:15.475 --> 16:16.909
Maybe you could give us a lift
actually down there

16:16.976 --> 16:18.145
and then we can just
put the tire on,

Right, if we're gonna get
out of here alive,

52:06.090 --> 52:08.793
we have to either kill
the fuckin' thing or trap it,

52:08.926 --> 52:10.060

Okay.

While the other's--
(Indistinct speech)

52:56.140 --> 52:58.309
I think if we can in lure it,
we can close the door,

52:58.443 --> 53:00.678
and lock it in that cage section
at the back.

It's for horses,

My name is Julia.

1:01:16.273 --> 1:01:17.975
Nice to meet you.

1:01:21.045 --> 1:01:23.347
Right, good?

Honestly, however you're doing,

1:01:24.514 --> 1:01:26.650
you're probably doing better
than me.

1:01:26.717 --> 1:01:27.818
I'm doing pretty bad.

I'm-- honestly,
let's be real for a second.

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:35.192
I'm still dealing
with the emotional trauma

1:01:35.292 --> 1:01:39.730
from being attacked by a raptor.

1:01:39.864 --> 1:01:41.165
(Audience members chuckling)

1:01:43.033 --> 1:01:45.169
Yeah, I'm dead serious.

1:01:45.235 --> 1:01:46.403
(Chuckling)

1:01:46.536 --> 1:01:47.337
Yeah.

1:01:47.404 --> 1:01:49.840
Actually,
I was almost literally dead,

1:01:49.974 --> 1:01:52.409
but my fabulously handsome

1:01:52.542 --> 1:01:56.380
and terrible at driving
best friend Kyle saved my life.

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:57.014
- Aw.
- Give him-- aw!

1:01:57.147 --> 1:01:57.882
Ooh.

1:01:58.015 --> 1:02:01.018
Yeah, it's me, bitches!

1:02:01.085 --> 1:02:02.686
Ooh!

1:02:02.820 --> 1:02:05.022
He's actually newly single,
by the way.

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:06.390
(Audience cheering)

1:02:06.523 --> 1:02:08.325
Uh, but ladies don't bother,

1:02:08.392 --> 1:02:10.560
he just recently came
out of the closet, so...

1:02:10.694 --> 1:02:11.561
Aw.

1:02:11.695 --> 1:02:13.998
Where he was hiding
from the raptor!

1:02:14.064 --> 1:02:15.933
Remember I was talking about
the raptor?

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:17.234
Yeah, I wasn't kidding
about that.

1:02:17.367 --> 1:02:18.869
I wasn't kidding.

1:02:18.936 --> 1:02:20.270
But also just some--

1:02:20.404 --> 1:02:22.072
some genuine advice
for you guys.

1:02:22.239 --> 1:02:25.075
If you ever find yourself
running from a raptor,

1:02:25.209 --> 1:02:27.544
I suggest wearing comfy shoes,

1:02:27.611 --> 1:02:29.847
because they are really
fucking fast.

1:02:29.947 --> 1:02:31.181
(Laughing)

1:02:31.281 --> 1:02:33.250
And they're really smart, too.

1:02:33.383 --> 1:02:35.085
While me and Kyle
were running you know,

1:02:35.219 --> 1:02:37.554
Kyle's like,
"Oh, do you think he saw us?"

1:02:37.687 --> 1:02:41.091
(Laughing)

1:02:41.225 --> 1:02:42.692
And I was like, "Yeah, Kyle,
he saw us,

1:02:42.759 --> 1:02:45.762
and he's probably doing
our fucking taxes, too."

1:02:45.896 --> 1:02:46.931
(Audience laughing)

1:02:47.064 --> 1:02:48.098
"He's really smart."

1:02:48.232 --> 1:02:49.900
He's like, "Oh, Julia, I just-

1:02:50.034 --> 1:02:53.637
I saw you spent $200
at IKEA in July.

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:55.806
We could probably claim that
back on work expenses."

1:02:55.940 --> 1:02:57.707
"Oh my God, raptor, really?"

1:02:57.774 --> 1:02:59.143

1:02:59.276 --> 1:03:00.110
"That's like so cool.

1:03:00.277 --> 1:03:01.145
Thank you so much."

1:03:01.278 --> 1:03:02.246
"Yeah, of course, Julia.

1:03:02.312 --> 1:03:03.713
Also, one more thing."

1:03:03.814 --> 1:03:04.548
"Yeah, raptor?"

1:03:04.648 --> 1:03:05.950
(Screaming)

1:03:06.083 --> 1:03:07.251
(Laughing)

1:03:07.384 --> 1:03:09.719
And then he eats me,
'cause he's a fucking dinosaur.

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:13.557

What's goin' on?
You okay?

Yeah.

Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1:04:01.471 --> 1:04:02.439
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

1:04:02.539 --> 1:04:03.273
Hey, don't be silly.

1:04:03.373 --> 1:04:04.541
Come here.

1:04:05.642 --> 1:04:07.811
So that nightmare again?

1:04:07.978 --> 1:04:08.845
Yeah.

1:04:08.979 --> 1:04:10.447
Hmm.

1:04:11.481 --> 1:04:13.150
Not the one that I get eaten,
is it?

1:04:15.452 --> 1:04:16.286
Maybe.

1:04:16.386 --> 1:04:19.723
Hmm, right.

1:04:19.856 --> 1:04:20.857
Sorry.

1:04:20.991 --> 1:04:22.492
Okay.

1:04:22.626 --> 1:04:23.961
Look, I get it, okay,
I really do,

1:04:24.028 --> 1:04:25.862
but they found it, right?

1:04:25.996 --> 1:04:27.697
There's nothing to worry
about anymore, okay?

1:04:27.831 --> 1:04:31.535
I know, but I just keep
thinking like w--

1:04:31.668 --> 1:04:34.704
what if he made more, you know?

1:04:36.473 --> 1:04:38.308
Babe, that's ridiculous.

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:39.743
- There's no way he made more.
- Is it?

1:04:39.876 --> 1:04:42.046
He could have totally made more.

1:04:42.179 --> 1:04:43.580
It's crazy that he made one.

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:45.215
There's no way, I promise you.

1:04:45.349 --> 1:04:46.850

- Promise.
