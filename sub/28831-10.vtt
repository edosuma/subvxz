00:00.876 --> 00:02.503
We need to have
the Christmas Festival
at the Coterie!

00:02.503 --> 00:03.295
What?

00:05.964 --> 00:07.883
‐Is the manager around?
‐I'm the manager.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.718
You're Claudette Bourguignon?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.471
<i>Oui!</i>

00:12.471 --> 00:13.430
Your lease is up.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.099
‐Did you know
he was in prison?
‐No.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.060
‐Mom never told you?
‐Oh, who cares?

00:18.602 --> 00:19.728
Who is this?

00:20.187 --> 00:21.188
This is our dad.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.067
‐Hey, wait, son.
‐Hey, man!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.194
I am not your son.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.111
Adriana:
I'm here, <i>Abuelo</i> .

00:28.820 --> 00:30.280
Doctor:
<i>Your father's had a stroke.</i>

00:30.280 --> 00:32.783
<i>But we won't know how severe</i>
<i>any complications may be</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:33.825
until he wakes up.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.410
Is there a chance
that he won't wake up?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.871
‐Jesus is in Nepal.
‐I thought he was in Tibet?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.665
Well he should be here.
It's Christmas.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.792
Is this the first Christmas
he's spent away from home?

00:41.792 --> 00:43.669
Yes, and we're not
very happy about it.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.963
Well, I understand the need
to travel and find oneself.

00:47.047 --> 00:47.965
(knock on door)

00:48.465 --> 00:49.258

00:50.008 --> 00:52.177
Do you think you have
like the flu or something?

00:52.719 --> 00:53.887
I think I'm pregnant.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.390
I'm gonna move out
of the Coterie.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.433
I'm scared you're just
gonna disappear.

Thank you for staying up late
on Christmas Eve

01:30.507 --> 01:31.925
to decorate!

01:32.426 --> 01:34.219
The Coterie looks amazing,
thank you!

01:34.219 --> 01:36.221
I appreciate you so much,

getting ready for
tomorrow's festival.

And I hope to see all
of your beautiful faces
tomorrow morning

01:41.768 --> 01:43.812

the help that we can get, so...

01:44.730 --> 01:46.982

Oh, and by everyone
do you mean Raj?

01:53.530 --> 01:54.531
No.

01:55.866 --> 01:56.658
(shutter clicks)

01:57.326 --> 01:59.745
Uh... where have you been?

01:59.745 --> 02:03.540
Ha. It's a very long
and X‐rated story.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.292
Starring the two of you,
I hope.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.085
No, no, no.
(laughing)

02:07.085 --> 02:08.462
Oh, then why are you blushing?

02:09.421 --> 02:13.258
Hey! So... since
I have all of you here,

02:13.258 --> 02:14.509
do you remember Claudette?

02:14.509 --> 02:15.510
(cat meows)

02:17.512 --> 02:19.056
So is that, uh...?

02:19.056 --> 02:21.099
Sphynx cat.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.102
Her name is Gaia.
She's my familiar.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.647
Ah, so, you're a witch now?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.023
(cat meows)

02:28.023 --> 02:30.192
Sorry. My eyes...

02:30.692 --> 02:32.069
Sorry, I'm allergic to smoke.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.612
Anyway, the reason
for my visit‐‐

02:33.612 --> 02:35.906
Wait.
I need to smudge you.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.992
I cannot have
any negative energy
invading my space.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.203

‐Saturn is in the 9th house.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.579
Okay. (coughs)

02:43.497 --> 02:45.332
Got it, um...
Let me sit right here.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.377
As I told you on the phone,
the Coterie lease is up,

02:48.377 --> 02:50.420
but we have
an option to extend.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.381
So we just need you to sign.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.759
Oh. (chuckles)
The Coterie.

02:55.759 --> 02:59.721
I started
<i>La Coterie Anarchiste.</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:02.349
Yeah, we dropped
the anarchist part, you know.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.934
It got a little
too "Purge"‐y.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.769
So, you run me out,

03:06.228 --> 03:07.562
you killed my dream,

03:08.313 --> 03:10.899
and now...
you need my help.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.985
In all fairness, you know,
you didn't give us
much of a choice,

03:13.985 --> 03:17.114
You know,
the primal scream therapy
in the middle of the night.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.991
The scream
travels better at night.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.286
But, <i>c'est de l'eau</i>
<i>sous le pont.</i>

03:23.912 --> 03:24.913
Meaning?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.582
I will sign the extension.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.084
Oh!

03:29.918 --> 03:31.336
Great!
Thank you so much!

03:31.336 --> 03:32.838
On one condition.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.091

move back in.

I would rather stick
hot knitting needles

03:42.514 --> 03:45.058
in my eyes and ears
and under my fingernails.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.185
That's the first time
I ever agreed with you.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.938
‐Okay.
‐Kelly: I'm serious.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.773
That's what I thought.
Just checking.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.819
I love you all.

03:56.695 --> 03:57.487

Oh, whiskey and croutons.
