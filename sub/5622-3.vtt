WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.835
<i>You're watching</i>
the last man on earth.

00:02.837 --> 00:06.138
We were known as kwa,
knitters with attitude.

00:06.140 --> 00:09.308
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sunday.</i>
<i>And check out</i>
<i>our other fox programs--</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:12.478
Brooklyn nine-nine,
the grinder<i> and</i> grandfathered.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.513
I'm a grand--
I'm a grandfather?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on fox.</i>

00:19.319 --> 00:21.487
They burned down my house
and skipped town.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.122
What are you doing?

00:23.124 --> 00:24.223
Like, they'd leave
a note or something.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.858
Phil:
"we've gone to malibu"?

00:25.860 --> 00:27.626
Phil:
We found 'em.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.795
Boo!

00:31.064 --> 00:32.131
Oh...

00:37.871 --> 00:39.705
And he was brave
to the end.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.908
And he fell with his
face to his foes.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.510
Age shall not
weary him.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.513
And at the going down
of the sun,

00:47.515 --> 00:49.148
And in the morning,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.150
We will remember him.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.585
Uh, todd, you have
something prep...

00:53.587 --> 00:55.587
Carol: Oh, uh, can I just
say something real quick?

00:55.589 --> 00:57.089
I'll be done in a jiffy.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.091
Phil 2:
I guess. Okay, sure.

00:59.093 --> 01:03.929
Um, well, you know,
I didn't know, uh...

01:03.931 --> 01:06.098
Gordon? Was it gordon?

01:06.100 --> 01:08.200
Gordon. Gordon.
Gordon.
Carol: Gordon.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.369
Is it gordon with a "g"?

01:10.371 --> 01:11.770
(deliberately):
Gordon.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.205
Okay.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.607
I grew up across the street
from a dordon.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.243
With a "d," like dracula.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.080
I did not know
<i>gordon</i> well.

01:21.082 --> 01:24.917
May he have a smooth
journey to heaven.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.685
Or hell.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.254
Again, I did not know him.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.091
By now, we are all
so used to death,

01:32.093 --> 01:36.028
As we have seen everyone
in the world around us die.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.863
Every single person-- dead.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.699
Just oodles and caboodles
of death.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.069
Just heaps and piles.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.805
But gordon will be missed.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.641
Uh, okay, uh, todd?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.443
You had something
you were gonna do?

01:55.148 --> 01:59.618
♪ if I could save time
in a bottle ♪

01:59.620 --> 02:01.787

02:06.059 --> 02:09.895

02:30.918 --> 02:32.985
(clattering)

02:38.591 --> 02:40.592
Whoa, uh, carol, watch out.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.094
Watch out, watch out!
(carol shouts)

02:42.996 --> 02:44.530
Phil. Aah!

02:44.532 --> 02:45.931
I just came in
to check on you.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.799
You cool?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.368
Okay, great.
Wait. W-w-wait.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.436
What's happening down there?
Well, I don't have time

02:51.438 --> 02:53.472
To talk right now, they're
having a wake for gordon.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.374
Wait, who was gordon?
Gail's lover.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.643
He<i> was</i> gail's lover.
(stammering): Okay...

02:57.645 --> 02:58.944
So have they said
anything about me?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.112
I mean, did you smooth
things over?

03:00.114 --> 03:01.613
You haven't really come up yet.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.048
What?!

03:03.050 --> 03:04.049
Phil, a man died.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.717
I killed him.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.553
So there's been a few other
things to talk about.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.555
So they didn't say
<i>anything</i> about me?

03:09.557 --> 03:10.722
Not one word.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.291
What does it matter
to you anyway?

03:12.293 --> 03:13.792
You don't care
about them, right?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.194
No, you're right, I don't.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.029
You know, don't care about them,
don't miss them.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.463
Okay, I got to go.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.065
Okay, w-w-wait.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.500
Just out of curiosity's sake,

03:21.502 --> 03:22.834
Like, what are you
gonna tell them?

03:22.836 --> 03:24.670
(sighs)
I'm sure in the moment,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.238
I'll think of a perfect thing.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.973
Well, hey, look, take your time.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.808
Again, could not care less

03:29.810 --> 03:32.177
About the whole situation
and the people involved, okay?

03:32.179 --> 03:34.213
I mean, uh, tell them I'm sorry
for their loss, obviously.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.647
I'm not an animal.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.649
Except for in the sack.
(hisses)

03:37.651 --> 03:39.218
Okay, got to go.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.486
Not a single word.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.723
Carol:
<i>Amazing.</i>

03:44.725 --> 03:48.393
Now, I'm assuming
this was gordon's house.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.395
Yeah. Yeah, we met up
with him on the beach,

03:50.397 --> 03:52.397
And he invited us all
to live here with him.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.233
Hmm.
It's been really nice.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.034
There are 13 bathrooms.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.202
Ooh la la.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.071
And none of them
work, but still.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.672
Still.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.408
Where is everybody?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.811
Oh, they're in the solarium
sharing stories about gordon.

04:07.447 --> 04:10.449
I just got to say I'm so
happy you got my note.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.050
I missed you so much.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.453
Oh, girl, I missed you, too.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.088
Get in here.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.124
(chuckles)

04:19.126 --> 04:20.525
You look the same.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.927
So do you, you look
just the same.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.929
So we all assumed, when
you didn't come back,

04:23.931 --> 04:25.897
You went with tandy--
what happened there?

04:25.899 --> 04:29.101
Oh, yeah, right.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.535
Well, that's
the thing is, um...

04:30.537 --> 04:31.903
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.739
No.
Oh, no.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.741
Ugh, my favorite
red and white horse shirt.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.142
I got to go get cleaned up.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.644
To be continued.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.813
Can't wait to tell you
everything.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.052
Phil 2:
Hey, carol.
(gasps)

04:47.054 --> 04:49.121
You look nice.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.158
The last time I saw you,

04:53.160 --> 04:54.593
We were making love.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.396
Is that right?
Yeah.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.398
You know, phil,
I owe you an apology.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.233
It really wasn't fair

05:01.235 --> 05:03.168
For me to leave tucson
without saying good-bye to you,

05:03.170 --> 05:04.903
And I'm-I'm sorry.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.072
Well, I guess you had to do
what you had to do, right?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.274
Hey.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.676
Oh, hey, erica.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.677
(chuckles)
look who's here.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.111
Hey, you two.
Hi.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.813
What's going
on in here?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.748
Absolutely... Well,
I was just welcoming her

05:16.750 --> 05:18.183
Back to the group.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.951
Welcome, carol.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.821
Well, I'm just gonna
be in the next room.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.256
Oh, yeah.

05:24.258 --> 05:27.826
So I'll just
say... Bye.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.228
(erica moans)

05:39.605 --> 05:40.706
Yeah.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.107
I'd better go.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.176
Bye.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.946
Nobody knew gordon
the way I knew him.

05:47.948 --> 05:51.817
He was a friend, a companion,

05:51.819 --> 05:55.887
Trusted advisor
and a valued lover.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.491
Sure, he could be
a real son of a bitch.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.960
He was so cranky
in the mornings,

06:01.962 --> 06:04.529
And he cussed
like a sailor.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.399
And he was a bad drunk,
he was a-a mean drunk.

06:07.401 --> 06:11.403
Racially insensitive,
male chauvinist pig.

06:11.405 --> 06:16.074
Um, and there was...
There was the body odor,

06:16.076 --> 06:20.078
Which was challenging for me,
but now I look back,

06:20.080 --> 06:23.515
And, um, you know,
when somebody dies,

06:23.517 --> 06:25.717
All that stuff just melts away,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.420
And you're just left
with the good memories,

06:28.422 --> 06:29.721
So to gordon.
Phil 2: Gordon.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.556
All: To gordon.
Easy come, easy go.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.392
Phil 2: Yeah,
son of a bitch.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.495
Hey, I know gordon's death has
been hard on all of us,

06:36.497 --> 06:39.598
But I'd just like to take
a sec to welcome carol back.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.500
Oh.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.534
To carol.
Yeah.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.403
Todd: Carol,
welcome back.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.037
Oh, you guys, stop.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.939
So what happened to you?
I mean, last we knew,

06:47.941 --> 06:49.374
You were headed
out to the desert

06:49.376 --> 06:51.376
To get tandy some
supplies, and then...

06:51.378 --> 06:53.378
You... Stayed with him?

06:53.380 --> 06:55.380
I did.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.015
Well, thank god he
didn't come with you.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.251
Yeah, what an absolute turd.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.685
Human garbage.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.687
Hey, settle
a bet for us.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.356
Did tandy kidnap you?

07:04.358 --> 07:06.358
No, I chose
to go with him.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.026
Whatever.
Where is he now?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.795
Did you scare him to death, too?

07:09.797 --> 07:12.631
Um...

07:13.766 --> 07:15.600
No.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.869
I had nothing to do
with tandy's death.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.638
What?
Hmm?

07:19.640 --> 07:20.972
Hmm.
Yeah.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.041
Tandy's dead.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.550
You told 'em I was dead?
Well, as I recall,

07:31.552 --> 07:34.619
You told gail and erica
I was dead, so now we're even.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.622
Carol, this isn't a "saying
people are dead" competition.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.257
(sighs)

07:39.259 --> 07:40.725
So how did I die?

07:40.727 --> 07:42.127
I don't know yet.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.962
I told 'em I had diarrhea

07:43.964 --> 07:46.398
So I could come back here
and work out the details.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.999
And I have diarrhea.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.302
Carol.
Look, it's gonna be fine.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.736
You should have heard
all the nice things

07:51.738 --> 07:53.738
They were saying
about this jerk gordon.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.674
People always remember
the dead fondly.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.442
I think

07:57.444 --> 08:00.912
With a little bit of time
and the right pr,

08:00.914 --> 08:03.181
You're gonna be
the next michael jackson.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.517
Phil, what's the first thing
you think

08:05.519 --> 08:07.018
When I say "michael jackson"?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.653
The molestation charge.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.088
(scoffs)
what?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.090
Well, you're in
the minority on that.

08:12.092 --> 08:15.594
Most people think
"beat it" or "p.Y.T."

08:15.596 --> 08:17.295
Yeah, trust me.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.197
This is gonna work out great.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.267
"beat it" was involved in what
I was talking about, yeah.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.668
Well, hardy har har, phil.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.071
You're a regular
brad garrett today.

08:27.874 --> 08:30.709
So, uh, what's up
with friggin' phil?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.143
You know, now that
he thinks I'm dead,

08:32.145 --> 08:33.545
He's probably
all over you, right?

08:33.547 --> 08:36.381
Oh, no, he and erica
are an item now.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.883
He's totally moved on.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.684
How about, uh, todd and melissa?

08:39.686 --> 08:40.685
They still together?

08:40.687 --> 08:41.887
Todd's gay.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.523
I knew it. I knew it.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.525
Just kidding. Boy,
for someone who claims

08:46.527 --> 08:48.360
He doesn't care
about the group,

08:48.362 --> 08:50.195
You have an awful lot
of questions about them.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.732
Come on, I could not give less
of a crap about them, okay?

08:53.734 --> 08:56.868
And I could not be more happy
than being up here alone.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.703
Well, don't get used to it.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.540
'cause I'm about to think
of the perfect death for you,

09:01.542 --> 09:04.543
And it's gonna be
noble and heroic

09:04.545 --> 09:06.578
And mind-changing.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.513
Carol:
The grand canyon.

09:08.515 --> 09:09.915
And that's where, uh...
Yeah.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.349
Where tandy died.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.184
You don't have to show us this.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.587
Oh, no, I-I want to.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.223
It's part of the
grieving process for me.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.324
(exhales)

09:19.326 --> 09:20.692
Okay.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.728
This is us approaching
the observation deck.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.164
As you can see, tandy's
still alive in this one.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.200
Not for long.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.070
It had always been on my
bucket list to do a handstand

09:32.072 --> 09:33.939
On the rim of a large canyon.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.708
I was 15 seconds into
my one-minute goal

09:36.710 --> 09:38.243
When things went awry.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.345
I slipped.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.180
And just as I was
about to become

09:42.182 --> 09:45.183
Yet another canyon
handstand statistic,

09:45.185 --> 09:47.886
Fate intervened...

09:47.888 --> 09:50.956
In the name
of philip tandy miller.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.724
Tandy sprung
into action.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.026
"grab my hand,"
he said.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.028
"you have nothing to
fear," he assured me

09:57.030 --> 09:59.764
With a callous disregard
for his own life.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.901
And then tandy slipped.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.737
He rocketed out
into the abyss.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.139
This is where the death
stuff really kicks in.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.809
So viewer discretion is advised.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.244
Okay.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.447
This is him in midair.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.549
In a bloodcurdling
scream, he yelled,

10:17.551 --> 10:22.387
"no regre..."

10:22.389 --> 10:27.225
(slowly fades)

10:27.227 --> 10:30.061
"...Ts."

10:30.063 --> 10:32.263
And then-- impact.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.165
This is him dead.

10:36.102 --> 10:39.404
And this is him dead closer.

10:43.109 --> 10:46.578
This is tandy dead as close
as I could bear to draw.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.415
Oh, todd.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.250
Are you sad about tandy?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.418
No, sorry, I'm just

10:53.420 --> 10:56.254
Thinking about gordon.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.824
Well, I'm sure one day
you'll cry about tandy, too.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.860
Probably not.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.328
Yeah.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.998
Oh, what's gail
up to out there?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.267
Melissa: She's been writing
gordon's name in the sand

11:09.269 --> 11:11.836
And watching
the tide wash it away.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.005
She says it's a form
of spiritual healing.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.840
"spiritual healing."

11:15.842 --> 11:17.475
Hmm.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.878
That's nice.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.715
(crying)

11:24.984 --> 11:27.052
Poor carol.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.454
Erica:
Yeah, poor carol.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.556
Yeah, oh,<i> poor</i> carol!

11:31.558 --> 11:32.857
Poor carol
made her choice.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.392
And now she's back and what?

11:34.394 --> 11:36.561
We're supposed to welcome her
with open arms?

11:36.563 --> 11:37.696
Pass.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.863
Have a little sympathy.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.298
I mean, I think
we can all agree

11:40.300 --> 11:42.000
That tandy was
a freaking crankshaft.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.369
But that's not
carol's fault.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.538
Look how broken
up she is.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.073
I'm still gonna pass.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.141
So...

11:51.744 --> 11:53.244
It's "pass."

11:53.246 --> 11:54.345
This is working, yes...

11:54.347 --> 11:56.214
Care package.
Oh!

11:56.216 --> 11:59.150
(crying)

11:59.152 --> 12:01.252
Oh, I hate seeing you
unhappy like that, girl.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.921
I just got to be strong,

12:02.923 --> 12:04.656
'cause I know that

12:04.658 --> 12:06.324
Tandy would want that.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.892
Well, you're not alone, girl.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.661
I know. I can

12:09.663 --> 12:11.663
Feel him with me right now.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.064
I'm here, too, carol.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.900
Phil, you should do
everything you can

12:15.902 --> 12:17.435
To make sure erica's happy.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.005
Because life is so short.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.907
That's exactly why I broke up
with her today.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.009
Why-why?
Why would you do that?

12:25.011 --> 12:26.878
'cause of what you said--
life is short.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.880
And I want to spend mine
with you.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.115
Phil, I...
No, no, no.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.649
(shushes)

12:33.853 --> 12:35.787
Oh, oh... Okay.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.856
Okay.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.023
Okay.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.797
I'm not wearing any sunscreen.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.314
(sighs)

13:07.586 --> 13:08.753
Carol:
Hey, phil!

13:08.755 --> 13:10.722
Before you ask,

13:10.724 --> 13:11.990
Everything's fine.
Don't worry.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.592
Going great.
Bee's knees.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.994
Got in a little
over my head.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.729
Nothing major.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.230
Just a minor tailspin.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.431
(stammers)
carol?

13:20.433 --> 13:21.666
What's going on?

13:21.668 --> 13:22.967
Phil broke up with erica

13:22.969 --> 13:24.335
And kissed me on the beach.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.137
What?!

13:26.139 --> 13:27.305
And that is why
I've decided to skip

13:27.307 --> 13:29.274
To the final phase of my plan.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.242
Someone's coming
back to life today.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.111
Me?

13:33.113 --> 13:35.613
Here, take this
walkie-talkie.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.915
This is your cue.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.684
Here's... Tandy!

13:39.686 --> 13:42.287
Carol, are you sure you're
not jumping the gun with this?

13:42.289 --> 13:44.589
Even if I was jumping the gun,
why would you care?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.457
You don't want to be
with them anyway, right?

13:46.459 --> 13:47.826
No, yeah, you're right.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.794
Mm-hmm, they all suck.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.629
And if this doesn't work,

13:51.631 --> 13:53.431
You and I will
just go back to tucson,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.800
And I will never
bring them up again, I promise.

13:55.802 --> 13:56.835
Okay, good.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.803
Great.
Freaking turds.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.271
Now, go get spruced up.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.439
And don't forget your cue.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.540
What's your cue?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.042
Here's tandy.
No!

14:04.044 --> 14:05.376
Were you not listening?

14:05.378 --> 14:08.046
It's "here's... Tandy!"

14:08.048 --> 14:10.682
Okay, yeah, got it, got it.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.183
We don't know anything

14:12.185 --> 14:14.786
About anything out here.

14:14.788 --> 14:18.289
And so, I boned up on cpr.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.792
I did this so that we are never,

14:20.794 --> 14:23.528
(over walkie-talkie):
Ever in a position

14:23.530 --> 14:25.730
Where we have to mourn
a loved one ever again.

14:25.732 --> 14:28.132
So, say this is gordon.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.468
And he's just been
fatally startled.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.971
And he's now experiencing

14:32.973 --> 14:35.273
Life-ending
cardiac distress.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.078
(crying)

14:40.080 --> 14:43.014
Gail?

14:43.016 --> 14:46.718
Why did I have to dress
the dummy in gordon's clothes?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.220
(crying)

14:49.222 --> 14:51.189
He even smells
like gordon!

14:51.191 --> 14:54.025
Hi, I just want to step in here

14:54.027 --> 14:57.896
With another
heartfelt apology to gail.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.699
In hindsight, "boo" was not
a great icebreaker.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.768
Maybe "hello" would have been

15:03.770 --> 15:05.503
A little less...

15:05.505 --> 15:08.373
Death-causing.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.008
And it's just too bad

15:10.010 --> 15:11.943
That tandy
couldn't have been here,

15:11.945 --> 15:15.179
Because he was an expert at cpr.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.781
Oh, come on.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.217
Easy, carol.
Coming in a little hot.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.719
He learned it because
he wanted to give me

15:21.721 --> 15:25.089
The gift of always knowing
I'd be safe.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.691
So thoughtful.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.192
You know what?

15:28.194 --> 15:29.761
Why don't we go around the horn

15:29.763 --> 15:31.629
And just say one thing

15:31.631 --> 15:33.531
That we'll always
remember about tandy?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.199
All right, I-I've got a memory

15:35.201 --> 15:36.367
I'd like to share.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.435
Oh, good.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.103
I'll never forget the time

15:39.105 --> 15:40.638
Tandy tried to kill me.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.073
Yeah, and I'll never
forget the time

15:42.075 --> 15:43.808
Tandy threatened
to kill me, too.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.376
Never forget all the times

15:45.378 --> 15:47.445
Tandy tried to trick me
into having sex with him.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.280
I'll never forget about how he
lied about you guys existing,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.915
So he could have sex
with gail and me.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.617
What a godforsaken tool.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.720
(all talking over each other)

15:55.722 --> 15:57.221
Okay.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.957
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.893
It's clear he will be missed.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.928
And that is why it gives me

16:03.930 --> 16:06.564
Great pleasure to say to you...

16:06.566 --> 16:08.399
Abort! Abort!

16:08.401 --> 16:09.500
Abort!
Here's...

16:09.502 --> 16:10.935
Oh, god, he's alive.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.637
Abort!
Tandy!

16:12.639 --> 16:14.439
No.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.573
Let's get out of here.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.542
Tandy? Tandy?
Come on.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.782
Good-bye and good riddance,
malibu.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.851
Yeah, smell you later.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.419
We're out of here.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.154
Bunch of turds.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.522
Oh, they don't need me?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.658
Well, I don't need them!

16:33.660 --> 16:37.061
(crying):
I never have and I never will.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.699
Carol:
Hello?

16:41.701 --> 16:44.535
Just came by to say
we're going back to tucson.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.472
So good-bye.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.941
Take care of each other.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.383
And then, after you
burned down his house

16:58.385 --> 17:00.852
And left that letter
implying bodily harm

17:00.854 --> 17:03.488
If he showed up here,

17:03.490 --> 17:05.056
He still insisted we come.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.325
Because he knew
how much I needed it.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.861
He did it for me.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.097
I tell you the tandy you knew
truly is dead.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.468
I just thought maybe you could
see it in your hearts

17:17.470 --> 17:19.303
To forgive him.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.205
I did.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.908
I don't regret it.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.252
So, he really has changed?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.921
Oh, my gosh!
Yes, melissa!

17:36.923 --> 17:39.757
He's a totally different person!

17:39.759 --> 17:41.359
They're good people.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.528
And I don't deserve them.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.164
I just wish they knew
how sorry I was.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.833
Not that an apology
would fix anything.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.235
Hell, they probably
wouldn't even listen anyway.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.738
Which is too bad,
because if they did,

17:53.740 --> 17:56.441
They'd know how sorry I am.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.943
But how do I get them to listen?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.613
So, you'll give him
another chance?

18:04.183 --> 18:05.349
Phil:
Freeze! Freeze!

18:05.351 --> 18:06.851
In the air!

18:06.853 --> 18:07.952
Hands where I
can see them!

18:07.954 --> 18:09.220
Now! Now! Now!

18:09.222 --> 18:10.788
(others clamoring)
calm down.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.228
Just sit still, okay,
and do not move

18:17.230 --> 18:18.729
And you will not get hurt, okay?

18:18.731 --> 18:20.264
Tandy, come on...
Aah!

18:20.266 --> 18:22.200
What did I just say, todd?!
Yeah.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.634
I said sit still!

18:23.636 --> 18:24.702
I said do not move!

18:24.704 --> 18:25.736
Tandy?
(shouts)

18:25.738 --> 18:27.805
You do not need that gun.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.140
I'm doing the talking now, okay?

18:29.142 --> 18:30.274
I'm doing
the talking now, okay?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.476
Look, I just came here

18:31.478 --> 18:32.877
To say I'm sorry.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.145
And the only reason
I have this thing

18:34.147 --> 18:35.613
Is so you guys'll stick around

18:35.615 --> 18:36.747
To listen to me, okay?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.249
So, uh...

18:38.251 --> 18:40.418
Do I have
your undivided attention?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.153
(all saying yes)
do I have it?

18:42.155 --> 18:45.323
Do I have
your undivided attention?!

18:45.325 --> 18:46.657
All:
Yes!

18:46.659 --> 18:48.259
Okay, thanks, thanks, thanks.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.994
Look, gail...

18:49.996 --> 18:52.263
Aah, hands where I can see them!
Hands! Hands!

18:52.265 --> 18:55.099
You are the best, okay?

18:55.101 --> 18:58.002
(stammers)
such a wonderful spirit

18:58.004 --> 18:59.904
And a beautiful soul.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.406
And it breaks my heart
that you lost gordon.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.143
And this must be
a very difficult day for you.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.445
Yep.
Okay, phil?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.614
Huge apology
coming at you right now.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.781
What?
Okay?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.316
This is gonna freak your bean,

19:12.318 --> 19:14.252
But I do not blame you one bit
for leaving me

19:14.254 --> 19:15.820
In the desert--
it was a wakeup call.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.321
And it made me the man
that I am today.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.422
Okay, erica!

19:18.424 --> 19:19.790
Hands out of
your pockets!

19:19.792 --> 19:21.192
I-I don't have any pockets.
Okay, okay.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.327
I thought they were pockets.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.796
Sorry.
But, phil?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.832
I've totally changed.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.200
And I have you
to thank for it.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.935
Thanks, dawg.
You're welcome.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.637
Aah, todd!
Do not be a hero!

19:32.639 --> 19:34.805
Sit back down!

19:34.807 --> 19:36.807
I love you, man.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.709
True friendship

19:38.711 --> 19:40.711
Is so hard to find
in this world.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.346
And I found it with you.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.714
And I threw it away.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.883
I just threw it
in the old garbagio, okay?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.486
And I hope one day
you will forgive me, bud.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.655
Phil, do not move a muscle or
I will shoot you full of holes!

19:50.657 --> 19:52.690
I won't, I won't, but I will.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.392
Melissa?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.526
Melissa, look at
me, look at me.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.228
Melissa, I want to talk to you.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.296
Uh, I will shoot you!

19:58.298 --> 20:00.698
Okay, thank you,
thank you.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.201
Melissa, you had to put up with
my crap longer than anyone else,

20:03.203 --> 20:05.803
Other than carol, okay?

20:05.805 --> 20:08.372
I just wish you had a chance
to see what carol's seen.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.674
I'm different, I swear.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.675
Todd, hands!

20:10.677 --> 20:12.143
Sorry, bro!

20:12.145 --> 20:14.011
I just said
some nice things about you!

20:14.013 --> 20:15.379
Listen to me!

20:15.381 --> 20:17.815
And finally, erica,

20:17.817 --> 20:20.384
Hey, phil's a freaking idiot
for breaking up with you.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.386
You're fun.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.754
You're gorgeous.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.389
And that accent
is just out of this world.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.991
Erica, when I remember you,

20:26.993 --> 20:28.526
I don't remember you like this.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.728
(australian accent):
I remember you like this.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.597
Cheers.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.765
(normal voice):
Now, if anyone has anything
they want to say,

20:34.767 --> 20:36.100
You know, raise your
hands if you do.

20:36.102 --> 20:40.037
(stammers)
uh, very, uh, slowly.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.206
Yeah, carol?

20:42.208 --> 20:45.576
They were about to give you a
second chance, you dumb donkey.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.278
What?!
(laughs)

20:47.280 --> 20:48.879
Shut up!

20:48.881 --> 20:51.349
You guys, oh,
you're not gonna regret this,

20:51.351 --> 20:52.583
I promise,
and look, like I said,

20:52.585 --> 20:53.951
I would never hurt you guys.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.086
I mean, this thing's
not even loaded.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.791
How long do I have
to be in here?

21:00.793 --> 21:03.461
Until we say you can come out.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.196
Okay, okay.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.469
So, the beard's back, huh?

21:11.471 --> 21:12.737
Yep.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.372
You likey?

21:14.374 --> 21:16.374
Nope.
(laughing)

21:16.376 --> 21:17.408
It'll grow on you.
Grew on me.

21:17.410 --> 21:22.213
About six months.
Good night.
