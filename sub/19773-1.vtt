<i>It's all about the brotherhood.</i>

00:36.142 --> 00:37.935
<i>It's a feeling...</i>

00:39.270 --> 00:41.439
<i>Of something to strive for, be proud of.</i>

00:43.358 --> 00:44.400
<i>Brotherhood is forever.</i>

00:45.777 --> 00:49.572
<i>Lambda men are leaders, scholarly,
honorable and proud.</i>

00:50.990 --> 00:52.158
<i>And sure it's rough.</i>

00:53.034 --> 00:54.034
<i>That's the point.</i>

00:54.577 --> 00:57.121
<i>After pledging,
a lambda man is ready for anything.</i>

- Shut up.

13:07.810 --> 13:09.186
- What did I tell you?
- Shut up.

13:09.269 --> 13:12.606
We're gonna pay for this sooner or later.
You wanna get beat down again?

13:13.899 --> 13:15.025
It was totally worth it.

13:16.360 --> 13:20.781
"In my bag here, I have a fool-proof
method for controlling your black slaves."

13:21.365 --> 13:24.910
I guarantee every one of you
that if it is installed correctly

13:25.577 --> 13:28.413
it will control the slaves
for at least 300 years.

13:28.914 --> 13:30.415
My method is simple.

13:30.499 --> 13:34.378
"I use fear, distrust
and envy for control purposes."

13:35.087 --> 13:36.087
Thank you, angel.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.680
Good job.

13:46.598 --> 13:50.811
I assume everyone read
the Willie lynch letter as assigned.

13:52.312 --> 13:53.312
Angel?

13:53.438 --> 13:56.817
Yeah, well, according to my research,
this document is made up.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.778
Some of the language used in it
is from the 21st century.

13:59.862 --> 14:00.862
Yes?

14:01.196 --> 14:03.240
I read something similar, but regardless,

14:03.323 --> 14:05.868
slave owners did use tactics
to divide us as a people.

14:05.951 --> 14:07.391
That doesn't make the document real.

14:07.452 --> 14:10.164
It's the truth that similar things
happened. How is that not real?

14:10.247 --> 14:12.541
I'm saying the document isn't real.

14:12.624 --> 14:15.836
It doesn't matter if whatever was written
in it happened or not.

14:15.919 --> 14:19.381
A fake man made a fake account
in a document written by someone else.

14:19.465 --> 14:22.759
This argument is real
because this topic is real.

14:23.802 --> 14:26.472
- Is that real hair up in your head?
- Ladies, ladies.

14:28.056 --> 14:30.434
- I paid for real hair.
- Exactly.

14:30.517 --> 14:32.853
Just because the hair is real,
it doesn't make your weave real.

14:32.936 --> 14:34.897
See, it's a weave. It's fake.

14:35.481 --> 14:37.774
Real facts, fake account, fake document.

14:37.858 --> 14:38.692
Okay.

14:38.775 --> 14:41.737
Okay, ladies, let's stick to the topic.

14:42.779 --> 14:43.779
Zurich.

14:44.615 --> 14:46.158
- Yeah?
- What are your thoughts?

14:47.993 --> 14:48.827
Um...

14:48.911 --> 14:52.039
I don't really know much about weaves
to answer, professor.

14:53.790 --> 14:54.791
Right.

14:56.543 --> 14:57.711
Well, for me, I just...

14:58.253 --> 15:00.255
I don't see how
we address the real issue

15:00.339 --> 15:02.633
by adopting half-baked urban myths.

15:03.550 --> 15:05.886
Don't need a real document
to wake us up, you know?

15:08.889 --> 15:11.391
It's good to see you're awake
behind those closed eyes.

15:12.935 --> 15:16.313
Okay, believers, non-believers alike,

15:16.396 --> 15:19.983
write at least two pages
presenting your thesis statement.

15:20.526 --> 15:24.238
Your paper on Frederick Douglass is due
in exactly one week.

15:24.321 --> 15:26.490
It's in the syllabus.

15:26.573 --> 15:27.741
Need I point it out?

15:33.997 --> 15:34.997
Mr. Condoll.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.250
Come in.

15:43.549 --> 15:44.549
Sit down.

15:54.101 --> 15:56.395
"If there is no struggle,
there is no progress."

15:58.605 --> 16:00.190
That's his most popular quote.

16:00.941 --> 16:02.317
There's not many people left

16:02.401 --> 16:05.445
who understand Frederick Douglass'
significance to history.

16:07.864 --> 16:10.075
So, uh, what did, you, um...?

16:10.158 --> 16:12.327
What did you wanna talk to me
about, professor?

16:13.704 --> 16:14.997
Whatever you like, Zurich.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.001
Well, I have to...

16:20.460 --> 16:23.755
I mean, I'll have to go get some lunch
before my biology class, so...

16:25.173 --> 16:26.800
You know. Thank you.

16:28.510 --> 16:30.470
I'm always here whenever you want to talk.

16:31.346 --> 16:32.514
About anything.

16:33.056 --> 16:34.725
I will keep that in mind, professor.

16:40.022 --> 16:44.234
"It's easier to build strong children
than to repair broken men."

16:49.615 --> 16:51.199
That's my favorite Douglass quote.

16:57.706 --> 16:58.749
Have a good day.

How you doing? Come out and donate.

17:45.879 --> 17:48.882
We're raising awareness of the effects
of breast cancer on our black women.

17:48.965 --> 17:50.801
- On our sisters.
- Our sisters.

17:50.884 --> 17:52.052
All right?

17:52.135 --> 17:54.012
All right? Hey, have a good one.

17:54.096 --> 17:55.514
Look at that. All right.

17:57.265 --> 17:58.265
Hey, boo.

17:58.975 --> 18:01.061
What's up? Are we still on for tonight?

18:01.520 --> 18:05.148
You know it's a hard week for me.
I just... just give me a week. All right?

18:05.232 --> 18:06.566
- A week?
- Yes, please.

18:06.650 --> 18:10.153
- Wait, what do they have you doing?
- Shh. Can you not be so loud, please?

18:10.696 --> 18:12.406
Yo, look at your boy.

18:13.448 --> 18:14.950
Yeah, right.

18:15.575 --> 18:16.660
Come on, Zee.

18:16.743 --> 18:19.303
- Get that fool off the yard. Homey, now.
- Right, sir.

18:19.371 --> 18:21.373
Okay, look, I have to go, all right?

18:21.456 --> 18:23.333
- Zurich?
- Hey.

18:23.417 --> 18:24.417
Hey.

18:25.252 --> 18:27.129
Hey! Chill, chill, chill.

18:28.755 --> 18:30.424
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

18:30.507 --> 18:32.027
You know you shouldn't be on the yard.

18:32.092 --> 18:33.892
Brothers catch you on campus
during hell week,

18:33.969 --> 18:36.012
you'll be in for a world of trouble,
young man.

18:36.513 --> 18:37.347
Yeah.

18:37.431 --> 18:39.266
How you holding up?
They treating you right?

18:39.349 --> 18:40.684
It's good. I'm good.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.562
Listen, I'm on your side no matter what.

18:43.979 --> 18:46.231
- Okay.
- Okay. Now, get on out of here.

18:46.314 --> 18:48.859
Make me proud
that I nominated you for my fraternity.

18:48.942 --> 18:49.985
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

18:55.282 --> 18:56.283
Follow me, number 4.

19:00.036 --> 19:03.707
- Turn the heat up on this fool.
- Put this Nigga in the zone, bro.

19:03.790 --> 19:06.710
Yo! Yeah, wait
until that shit get nice and hot.

19:06.793 --> 19:08.295
Get your mind off the Punani.

19:08.378 --> 19:11.631
Is that sweat, number 4?
Or is you crying like a little bitch?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.884
It's about to get real hot in here,
number 4.

19:16.636 --> 19:17.636
I got this, Cee.

19:18.054 --> 19:19.054
You got what?

19:23.185 --> 19:26.021
Better not catch your ass talking
to the Dean again, number 4.

19:39.659 --> 19:41.620
Hell week is a mystery, boy.

19:43.246 --> 19:45.874
- You never know what you're gonna get.
- Yes, big brother!

19:48.752 --> 19:50.086
Y'all think it's tough now...

19:51.463 --> 19:52.631
Just wait for hell night.

19:53.882 --> 19:55.550
Punch after kick for no reason

19:55.634 --> 19:57.594
other than just to see
how bad you want it.

19:59.221 --> 20:00.221
It's...

20:00.722 --> 20:02.224
Mind over matter, you know?

20:04.768 --> 20:06.269
You look like shit, number 4.

20:08.855 --> 20:10.440
Nothing a hot shower won't fix.

20:12.359 --> 20:13.359
Get out of there.

20:30.669 --> 20:32.069
My baby better shine, too.

20:34.422 --> 20:35.674
And don't forget my rims.

20:51.147 --> 20:52.691
Y'all not washing fast enough.

20:53.942 --> 20:55.318
Y'all heard. Snap!

20:57.654 --> 20:59.114
Hey, hey, hold up.

20:59.197 --> 21:01.157
Hey! Bring your black ass over here, bro.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.663
Hey, yo. Stop flinching.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.331
What I tell you about that?

21:09.541 --> 21:10.876
You're not cut out for this.

21:11.543 --> 21:12.711
Quit!

21:12.794 --> 21:14.129
No, he not quitting.

21:14.379 --> 21:17.173
I bet I could make him quit, goddamn.

21:17.382 --> 21:19.384
Number 4,
why you pledging this frat, man?

21:20.093 --> 21:22.095
Why you getting your ass beat
for this shit?

21:23.805 --> 21:24.931
Because of brotherhood.

21:25.015 --> 21:27.267
You don't even know
what you talking about, man.

21:28.810 --> 21:31.104
Brotherhood! Scholarship!
Leadership! Compassion!

21:35.692 --> 21:36.693
Why are you here?

21:39.446 --> 21:40.446
Why are you here?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.455
You don't even know, do you?

21:50.624 --> 21:52.959
Man, get back to them bubbles,
man. Think about it.

21:54.794 --> 21:55.837
Get your ass...

It's gorgeous.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.263
Girl, what you wanna do in Paris?

22:47.347 --> 22:48.932
There's plenty to do in Paris.

22:49.557 --> 22:52.811
- Like what? What they got we don't got?
- The Eiffel Tower?

22:53.144 --> 22:54.437
Statue of Liberty. Next.

22:54.979 --> 22:55.979
The Louvre.

22:56.356 --> 22:57.356
The Smithsonian.

22:57.857 --> 23:00.026
You've never even been to the Smithsonian.

23:00.110 --> 23:01.945
They even got a waffle house in Paris?

23:02.028 --> 23:04.406
Paris is the culinary center of the world.

23:05.198 --> 23:07.200
That's a no.
They don't have a waffle house.

23:08.284 --> 23:10.495
Don't you want
to go to the motherland?

23:10.578 --> 23:12.163
Visit your family, Zimbabwe.

23:12.747 --> 23:15.667
Negro, please,
I am not from no Zimbabwe tribe.

23:15.750 --> 23:18.336
My family's from chi-town
by way of Louisiana.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.255
You're right. Hold on.

23:21.256 --> 23:22.632
No. Don't answer it.

23:22.716 --> 23:24.634
- Come on, let's eat first.
- I have to, babe.

23:24.718 --> 23:26.302
- Seriously?
- Hello?

23:29.139 --> 23:30.139
Yes, sir.

23:31.725 --> 23:33.518
Yes, sir. I'll be there in 30 minutes.

23:35.061 --> 23:36.855
I'll be there in 10 minutes. Yes, sir.

23:38.148 --> 23:39.649
Okay. Right.

23:42.068 --> 23:43.069
Really?

23:43.153 --> 23:44.404
Day's not even over yet.

23:45.363 --> 23:47.407
Can I borrow 40 bucks, babe?
Don't ask why,

23:47.490 --> 23:49.325
but I promise I'll pay you back. Please?

23:53.913 --> 23:55.331
- You're a goddess, okay...
- Mm.

23:57.125 --> 23:59.836
You better not pull this shit
on my birthday, you hear me?

24:00.253 --> 24:01.254
I won't, I promise.

24:01.921 --> 24:03.506
Okay? I love you.

24:07.260 --> 24:08.803
Hey, man, $37.

24:08.887 --> 24:10.013
What's up, man?

24:11.347 --> 24:12.347
All right.

24:17.479 --> 24:18.479
Hello.

24:19.731 --> 24:21.107
I'll be there, man. What's up?

24:21.983 --> 24:22.983
All right. Bye.

24:24.194 --> 24:25.474
- Thank you.
- All right.

24:26.946 --> 24:30.241
Yo, man, I'm not risking my neck
for a bunch of fuck-ups, man. I'm out.

24:33.870 --> 24:35.580
Yo, square, come on, fool. Let's go.

24:35.663 --> 24:37.665
- No, we should go together.
- Man, shut up.

24:44.506 --> 24:45.673
Yo, what is he doing?

24:46.132 --> 24:48.218
Ain't nobody's girl
ever last through hell week.

24:54.766 --> 24:55.766
So, Ron.

24:56.726 --> 24:57.726
You a virgin?

24:58.394 --> 24:59.979
Man, why you asking me that?

25:00.396 --> 25:04.526
No, like, you're super-religious,
you won't drink, so I'm assuming...

25:05.693 --> 25:08.404
Yes, I'm saving myself for marriage
and I don't drink.

25:08.488 --> 25:10.073
Holy shit!

25:10.532 --> 25:12.367
- Yo, how you do that?
- I pray.

25:12.450 --> 25:15.130
- Hurry up, man, we late. What's up, bro?
- I know, I know.

25:15.870 --> 25:18.706
- At least you got the beer.
- Shit, where your backpack?

25:18.790 --> 25:21.417
- I forgot it, bro. Let's just go.
- Yo, yo, yo.

25:21.501 --> 25:25.380
Your man said he won't drink
and he a virgin because he pray.

25:26.464 --> 25:28.341
- Better pray we make it on time.
- Shit.

25:33.847 --> 25:35.098
Hey, Edwin.

25:37.475 --> 25:38.393
Not tonight, Toya.

25:38.476 --> 25:41.104
What you mean not tonight?
You know you want me in there.

25:43.523 --> 25:45.108
I know you want me in there.

25:45.191 --> 25:47.902
- You want me in there doing this to you.
- Come on, man.

25:49.487 --> 25:51.489
- Stop playing.
- No, no.

25:52.407 --> 25:53.241
No.

25:53.324 --> 25:56.077
Just 'cause you're some president
of some fancy fraternity

25:56.160 --> 25:58.663
don't mean you could be out here
treating me like a ho.

25:58.746 --> 26:00.999
You having a party up in there,
let your girl in.

26:01.082 --> 26:02.542
I said get, girl.

26:02.625 --> 26:05.587
Okay? Get. Come on. Come on.

26:06.546 --> 26:07.380
Oh, hey.

26:07.463 --> 26:08.590
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:08.673 --> 26:09.673
Who this?

26:09.924 --> 26:10.924
New pledges?

26:11.259 --> 26:12.844
It's, um, Dwight.

26:14.178 --> 26:15.178
Mm-hm.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.681
You a football player?

26:16.764 --> 26:19.100
I said get out of here.
Don't make me say it again.

26:19.183 --> 26:20.183
Go.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.191
I'll see you later, Dwight.

26:28.484 --> 26:30.737
Come on, y'all, we out.
Excuse me.

26:32.322 --> 26:34.115
Yo, what the hell you looking at, man?

26:36.451 --> 26:38.369
Shit's supposed to be in your bag, man.

26:39.746 --> 26:41.247
How many times I gotta tell you?

26:44.918 --> 26:46.628
Where the rest of your boys at, man?

26:52.717 --> 26:55.219
They already here, man.
Just get in the fucking party.

26:56.304 --> 26:58.014
Go on in, get on some ho's, man.

26:58.097 --> 26:59.097
Snap!

27:01.601 --> 27:02.601
Hello.

27:02.852 --> 27:04.854
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

27:04.938 --> 27:07.941
Like that dress, I do. It fits you.

27:12.028 --> 27:14.948
- That shit's ready, bro.
- Let's do it fast, bro.

Uh... that'd be great.

41:04.526 --> 41:06.820
That'd be great.
I could use some help like that.

41:06.904 --> 41:08.197
Well, one thing at a time.

41:08.697 --> 41:10.949
Just keep your mind
on getting through hell week.

41:12.868 --> 41:13.868
Yes, sir.

41:23.754 --> 41:26.048
No funny business. Get in, get out.

41:43.774 --> 41:44.814
Happy birthday.

41:56.578 --> 41:57.788
Let's go, let's go!

42:11.093 --> 42:12.386
Oh, my god!

42:13.387 --> 42:14.596
Did you do this?

42:15.180 --> 42:16.180
Nope.

42:19.685 --> 42:20.685
What...?

42:26.525 --> 42:27.525
Oh.

42:32.948 --> 42:34.783
I bet he bought it at Walmart.

42:52.301 --> 42:53.927
Zurich. Hey.

42:54.386 --> 42:57.806
Good morning, professor. I can't chat,
though. I'm headed to cast my vote.

42:57.890 --> 42:59.933
Well, it's a beautiful morning, isn't it?

43:00.893 --> 43:02.019
How's the paper going?

43:03.562 --> 43:05.272
It's good. It's good. I'm on it.

43:09.026 --> 43:11.069
All right, I will catch you later,
professor.

43:12.029 --> 43:15.991
Hey, if you're gonna cast your ballot,
student union's this way. Come on.

43:16.325 --> 43:18.744
- Walk with me.
- You keep me on my toes, professor.

43:19.870 --> 43:22.122
Seriously, man. Talk to me.

43:23.624 --> 43:25.375
Are we talking about the paper or...?

43:25.459 --> 43:27.336
Well, I don't know. Are we?

43:31.256 --> 43:33.508
I'm going through some things right now.

43:33.592 --> 43:34.676
Yeah, I know.

43:35.260 --> 43:37.346
And you should know
that I am here to help.

43:37.429 --> 43:40.807
For what, so you can look down on me
like my girlfriend? No, no.

43:41.475 --> 43:42.851
No, thanks. I'm...

43:44.186 --> 43:46.271
I'm not quitting.

43:46.355 --> 43:47.940
Did I say anything about quitting?

43:48.357 --> 43:49.483
Say what, professor?

43:52.069 --> 43:54.696
- You're injured, aren't you?
- No, I'm fine.

43:54.780 --> 43:56.949
I can tell by your breathing
you have an injury.

43:57.032 --> 43:59.409
And the way you're holding your side,
it's your ribs

43:59.493 --> 44:01.245
and you should get it looked at.

44:01.828 --> 44:05.707
Appreciate it, I am trying to keep my head
low and make it through hell week, okay?

44:07.251 --> 44:09.127
Mind over matter. That's it.

44:10.379 --> 44:11.546
I ain't no leader.

44:12.130 --> 44:14.508
You know, you don't always choose
to be a leader.

44:14.591 --> 44:16.468
People gravitate to you.

44:17.135 --> 44:18.345
You can't run from it.

44:19.805 --> 44:23.934
Well, I'm not anybody, okay?
And who am I to change anything?

44:28.897 --> 44:31.984
I want you to take that passion
and lead by example.

44:32.776 --> 44:35.821
You light the torch that leads
your brothers out from the underground,

44:35.904 --> 44:37.665
back to what your fraternity
was meant to be.

44:39.741 --> 44:41.451
You see it through, Condoll.

44:42.744 --> 44:44.079
Morning. Good morning.

44:44.162 --> 44:47.332
Morning, morning. I have to go.
I'm gonna go cast my vote.

44:47.416 --> 44:50.460
Zurich, you take care
of that extra assignment.

44:50.877 --> 44:52.337
Yes, Ma'am, professor Hughes.

44:54.006 --> 44:57.134
Great day for a student body election,
am I right, professor Hughes?

44:57.217 --> 44:59.177
- Mm.
- Energy, fresh blood...

45:00.262 --> 45:01.805
Long as it's not on our hands.

45:03.265 --> 45:04.599
Good day, Dean Richardson.

45:08.895 --> 45:10.576
<i>The struggle may be a moral one...</i>

45:11.857 --> 45:13.275
<i>Or it may be a physical one...</i>

45:15.402 --> 45:17.237
<i>And it may be both moral and physical,</i>

45:17.320 --> 45:19.823
<i>but it must be a struggle.</i>

45:19.906 --> 45:21.867

My Nigga, he ain't got no rhythm.

46:05.410 --> 46:07.329
Hey, get that shit right, number 1.

46:07.954 --> 46:08.955
- Lambda!
- Lambda!

46:09.039 --> 46:09.956
- Lambda!
- Lambda!

46:10.040 --> 46:11.083
Lambda!

46:14.795 --> 46:16.004
March on beat,

46:16.588 --> 46:19.007
or there won't be no probate show for you.

46:21.093 --> 46:22.093
All right?

46:23.678 --> 46:26.056
So get! It! Right!

46:26.139 --> 46:27.979
Yo, stop, stop, bro. That's enough.

46:33.396 --> 46:35.982
- Yeah, fall out. Fall out, man! Fall out!
- Shit.

46:37.025 --> 46:39.065
- Go there.
- Hey, right here! Here!

46:39.111 --> 46:40.951
- Go, go, go.
- Yo, yo, yo!

46:41.029 --> 46:43.069
- Ball, ball, ball.
- Right here. Right here.

46:43.657 --> 46:44.991
On your knees.

46:45.659 --> 46:47.452
Keep your hands where we can see them.

47:03.385 --> 47:07.055
- What are you boys doing out here?
- We're just practicing football, officer.

47:10.642 --> 47:13.043
We've been watching you boys
for a while now and...

47:14.729 --> 47:16.857
Tell me
what you're really doing out here.

47:24.322 --> 47:25.322
Officer,

47:25.866 --> 47:29.035
we're just a bunch of fraternity brothers
practicing for a step show.

47:29.369 --> 47:30.369
That's all, sir.

47:39.671 --> 47:41.464
So much for your code of silence, huh?

47:44.259 --> 47:45.844
I was a fraternity brother myself.

47:49.055 --> 47:52.726
You get up out of my woods and don't
let me catch you here after hours again.

47:52.809 --> 47:53.809
Yes, sir.

47:56.188 --> 47:58.231
Come on. Thank you.

47:59.191 --> 48:00.191
Go.

48:07.115 --> 48:08.575
- Oh, man.
- Sorry.

48:09.910 --> 48:12.537
It'll be all right though, man.
It's just a sprain.

48:14.789 --> 48:16.374
Thanks, doc.

48:17.334 --> 48:18.543
I like the sound of that.

48:20.337 --> 48:22.881
Well, as long as you don't drop the line,

48:23.298 --> 48:24.925
I'm squared away.

48:25.008 --> 48:27.093
I'm not gonna drop... square...

48:27.177 --> 48:30.138
Oh, that was... that was you trying
to be funny, right? Like a joke?

48:30.222 --> 48:32.307
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. Feel that, though.

48:32.390 --> 48:33.725
- Ow. Man.
- Ooh. My bad.

48:37.312 --> 48:39.147
<i>Billy, don't leave me again.</i>

48:40.523 --> 48:41.399
<i>I won't.</i>

48:41.483 --> 48:44.319
Yo, what the fuck are we watching?
Put the game on, man.

48:45.153 --> 48:48.323
Yo, keep gulping that water.
Don't spill that shit on my floor, boy.

48:48.406 --> 48:50.242
- You ain't never see this?
- No.

48:50.325 --> 48:53.328
It's actually a good movie, bro,
if you ignore that romantic shit.

48:54.204 --> 48:55.204
See...

48:55.622 --> 48:58.625
This vampire saves this girl from dying,
'cause he love her,

48:58.708 --> 49:00.585
but the thing is, he used his own blood.

49:00.669 --> 49:02.128
<i>I will return.</i>

49:02.212 --> 49:03.212
Yo, Cee.

49:03.421 --> 49:05.382
How is that better than basketball?

49:07.634 --> 49:09.715
Hey, don't throw up
on my fucking floor, boy.

49:11.554 --> 49:14.182
Hey, ain't nobody say y'all Niggas
get out of your line.

49:16.351 --> 49:17.952
About to teach you mutts a lesson.

49:18.019 --> 49:19.104
<i>I am.</i>

49:20.480 --> 49:21.898
Stick your hands out.

49:24.693 --> 49:25.902
I got it, bro.

49:33.785 --> 49:35.620
Any of you thinking about quitting yet?

49:35.704 --> 49:37.624
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

49:38.123 --> 49:38.999
Shit.

49:39.082 --> 49:42.502
Hey, go upstairs, read about the
history of the fraternity. Come on. Snap!

49:52.721 --> 49:53.722
What took you so long?

49:53.805 --> 49:55.348
Chill out, I'm here.

49:55.432 --> 49:56.725
Hey, y'all. What's going on?

49:57.517 --> 49:59.686
Hey. This is my girl candy.

50:00.270 --> 50:01.187
Hey, everybody.

50:01.271 --> 50:03.565
Hey, candy.

50:03.648 --> 50:04.733
Y'all stupid.

50:06.693 --> 50:08.987
It smells in here,
like y'all been working out.

50:09.070 --> 50:10.780
Shit, I'm about to work you out.

50:11.323 --> 50:12.907
Get your ass upstairs, girl.

50:13.450 --> 50:16.369
- Get that ass upstairs.
- Boy, stop.

50:16.453 --> 50:17.287
I'm gonna be back.

50:17.370 --> 50:18.496
Hey, candy.

50:18.580 --> 50:19.664
We got plenty of brews.

50:20.707 --> 50:21.624
Okay.

50:21.708 --> 50:24.919
Lambda lambda phi... founded 1902.

50:25.003 --> 50:27.505
Fraternity quickly established
chapters where?

50:37.182 --> 50:39.517
Hell, he is putting in that work.

50:41.227 --> 50:43.646
Bro, he knee-deep in that pussy.

50:43.730 --> 50:46.983
Stop. We need to read this history,
so we don't get our ass kicked.

50:47.067 --> 50:49.903
Shit, what does it matter?
We gonna get our ass kicked anyway.

50:49.986 --> 50:50.986
Wake up, bro.

50:53.156 --> 50:54.157
No, no, no. No, sit.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.200
Relax...

50:57.535 --> 50:58.578
But not relaxed.

51:04.751 --> 51:06.044
Who wants to fuck that girl?

51:08.755 --> 51:10.298
So, none of y'all want the pussy?

51:13.134 --> 51:14.134
Well, guess what?

51:14.886 --> 51:16.846
You ain't got no choice in that matter.

51:18.264 --> 51:19.264
Hey, yo, e.

51:19.933 --> 51:20.934
Game on, bro.

51:24.229 --> 51:25.229
Oh, hell, no, no.

51:31.361 --> 51:32.404
Number 4, you first.

51:33.988 --> 51:36.032
Get up. Snap! Get up!

51:38.159 --> 51:39.536
Keep studying, keep studying.

51:46.084 --> 51:47.293
Took you long enough.

51:48.128 --> 51:50.296
Come on, get in here
before the club closes.

51:51.506 --> 51:53.508
Mm.

51:55.176 --> 51:56.594
Mm.

51:59.889 --> 52:01.015
Ow. Stop, stop. Hold on.

52:01.391 --> 52:02.725
Boy, what's your problem?

52:09.232 --> 52:11.276
Damn. How about we just cuddle?

52:11.359 --> 52:12.360
Cuddle? What?

52:12.444 --> 52:14.362
Look, I see you can't do this.

52:15.363 --> 52:17.449
Look, I won't tell the boys on you,
all right?

52:17.866 --> 52:21.077
And besides, I don't wanna give you
the final blow

52:21.161 --> 52:24.539
that sends you to the hospital,
because, boy, I will. I'm that good.

52:24.622 --> 52:26.624
- Oh, you're that good?
- Yes, I'm that good.

52:27.917 --> 52:30.211
Well... what's it gonna be, Kunta?

52:30.920 --> 52:31.920
Kunta?

52:34.174 --> 52:35.675
What you know about Kunta Kinte?

52:35.758 --> 52:37.552
Boy, don't even get me started.

52:40.305 --> 52:41.681
- Ow, ow. Ow.
- Ooh.

52:42.390 --> 52:44.017
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

52:52.066 --> 52:53.902
Why do you let him treat you like this?

52:54.819 --> 52:57.155
Who? Edwin?

52:57.906 --> 52:59.157
Please.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.368
Nobody makes me do nothing
I don't wanna do.

53:03.995 --> 53:05.622
Then why are you doing this, then?

53:06.539 --> 53:08.791
Your girlfriend know
about this part of pledging?

53:09.542 --> 53:10.877
Who says I have a girlfriend?

53:11.252 --> 53:13.379
Oh, boy, please, I know your type.

53:13.463 --> 53:17.217
Okay, Mr. puppy eyes, go to church,
respectable-type Nigga.

53:17.300 --> 53:18.426
You wanna fuck...

53:19.427 --> 53:22.013
But you gotta have a girl to do it,
or you feel ignoble.

53:22.972 --> 53:25.808
You ain't no different than me.
I love fucking, okay?

53:25.892 --> 53:28.937
I just don't need to prove I got respect
by doing it with one man.

53:30.271 --> 53:32.106
- I'm free.
- Mm.

53:32.815 --> 53:33.815
Ignoble.

53:34.734 --> 53:36.277
Do you even know what that means?

53:36.569 --> 53:38.821
I ain't ignorant.

53:39.948 --> 53:42.992
You do not have to go to college
to know stuff.

53:43.660 --> 53:44.744
I learn from life.

53:45.870 --> 53:47.830
- I'm gonna write me a book one day.
- Yeah?

53:47.914 --> 53:50.166
Mm-hm. Full of fancy words.

53:50.250 --> 53:53.336
All the white women in Oprah's book club
gonna be reading my shit.

53:53.711 --> 53:55.380
Watch.

53:55.463 --> 53:57.298
- Okay, I see you.
- Mm-hm.

53:57.840 --> 54:00.051
All right, so you need to start
making noise.

54:00.134 --> 54:02.095
- What do you mean?
- Ooh.

54:02.178 --> 54:03.178
Wait.

54:03.346 --> 54:05.098
What are you doing?

54:05.265 --> 54:08.726
Would you start making noise? This is
the show or they gonna suss you out.

54:11.312 --> 54:13.815
Yeah... fuck, stop.

54:14.691 --> 54:17.777
Okay, you need to get those ribs
looked at.

54:18.319 --> 54:20.488
You might have a hairline fracture
or something.

54:21.114 --> 54:22.114
How...?

54:23.491 --> 54:24.951
Where do you learn this stuff?

54:26.578 --> 54:27.745
Huh?

54:27.996 --> 54:28.996
I'm serious.

54:37.046 --> 54:38.046
What's your name?

54:39.257 --> 54:40.257
Toya.

54:40.717 --> 54:41.717
Just toya?

54:42.510 --> 54:43.720
Yup.

54:48.182 --> 54:49.767
You know, my pops used to go here.

54:51.477 --> 54:53.313
You're doing this 'cause your pops did?

54:54.397 --> 54:55.523
No, he dropped line.

54:57.233 --> 55:00.653
Mm-hm.
What does he think about you pledging?

55:04.282 --> 55:07.118
All right, now you better start
making noise.

55:07.452 --> 55:10.121
Come on.
Look at you, all up in Toya's shit.

55:16.127 --> 55:18.546
Toya, damn. God damn.

55:22.175 --> 55:23.843
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.

55:36.898 --> 55:39.275
Look, I'm sweating,
and we didn't even do nothing.

55:42.695 --> 55:43.695
Whew.

55:47.450 --> 55:48.993
Thank you, toya.

55:50.495 --> 55:52.747
- For real.
- Boy, get your ass out of here.

55:53.081 --> 55:55.333
Come on, let's go.
You gotta get out of here. Go.

55:57.919 --> 55:58.920
Where's the bathroom?

56:00.004 --> 56:01.589
Go. Next!

56:13.184 --> 56:14.184
Go.

56:19.524 --> 56:20.692
So, where'd we leave off?

56:22.819 --> 56:23.819
See?

56:24.028 --> 56:24.946
It's not so bad.

56:25.029 --> 56:26.864
Community service is good for everyone.

56:28.866 --> 56:30.660
Now, all this work got me hungry, man.

56:32.829 --> 56:35.957
Get that out of my face. Get it out
of my face. What's wrong with you?

56:36.040 --> 56:38.334
- You ain't hungry.
- I don't want no dog food, bro.

56:38.418 --> 56:39.460
Oh, it's dog food, huh?

56:40.044 --> 56:42.765
- You a nasty motherfucker.
- Line up, line up, line up!

56:46.175 --> 56:47.635
I want you all to hear this.

56:54.684 --> 56:56.269
Don't forget you all been touched.

56:57.645 --> 57:00.773
You are following in the footsteps
of the most prestigious black men

57:00.857 --> 57:03.484
in American history,
and thus far, you've done good work.

57:04.777 --> 57:06.070
Yes, sir, Dean Richardson.

57:06.154 --> 57:07.363
Number 4, step forward.

57:09.115 --> 57:10.658
Your father must be proud of you.

57:11.993 --> 57:12.994
Yeah, he is, sir.

57:14.746 --> 57:17.707
Your father didn't cross line back
in the day, but you will.

57:17.790 --> 57:21.753
You are in the good hands of generations
of tradition and honorable brothers.

57:23.796 --> 57:24.796
Thank you, sir.

57:25.256 --> 57:26.257
Make me proud.

57:28.176 --> 57:29.510
And that goes for all of you.

57:31.387 --> 57:32.930
I am the master of my fate.

57:33.014 --> 57:34.891
I am the captain of my soul.

57:56.829 --> 57:58.039
He seems really nice.

57:59.123 --> 58:01.292
So, that's the one.
Remember, I was telling you.

58:01.375 --> 58:04.629
- Girl.
- There is nothing like some fresh dick.

58:06.214 --> 58:09.217
No, but those new Lambda Pledgees
are fine as hell. Did you see them?

58:09.300 --> 58:10.510
- Yes.
- Right.

58:10.593 --> 58:12.637
- Girl, you don't discriminate.
- Mnh-mnh.

58:12.720 --> 58:16.015
- What lambda you ain't fucking?
- Oh, girl. And it was wild.

58:19.644 --> 58:21.896
Hi, excuse me.
Did you say that you slept with...?

58:21.979 --> 58:23.940
- Excuse me. Can I take your order?
- Yeah.

58:24.023 --> 58:26.275
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

58:26.442 --> 58:27.944
What is your name?

58:28.069 --> 58:28.986
It's right here.

58:29.070 --> 58:31.614
Did you say you slept
with the lambda dogs and their Pledgees?

58:31.697 --> 58:34.158
None of your business.
Did you come here to order or what?

58:34.242 --> 58:36.002
- Or not?
- Was there a guy named Zurich there?

58:36.077 --> 58:37.495
Was there?

58:38.788 --> 58:40.206
- We're not hungry.
- What you mean?

58:40.289 --> 58:41.970
- Bye. Have a good day.
- Bye.

58:42.041 --> 58:44.627
- Head back to campus and study. Yeah.
- Bye-bye.

58:44.710 --> 58:45.710
- Bye.
- Bye.

58:45.753 --> 58:47.313
Did she just walk up to me?

58:47.380 --> 58:49.841
- Kimberly, go.
- No, you need to go talk to that girl.

58:49.924 --> 58:51.968
She is not the one that needs talking to.

58:52.051 --> 58:53.302
Come on, let's just go.

58:53.719 --> 58:55.054
Come on. For real.

59:21.330 --> 59:22.456
Hey. What's up, babe?

59:23.457 --> 59:24.542
Mm. Uh...

59:25.126 --> 59:26.126
What, I stink?

59:26.711 --> 59:28.296
Sorry. They have us busy all week.

59:28.379 --> 59:31.007
- I ain't showered, so...
- Did you sleep with another girl?

59:32.216 --> 59:33.968
What are you talking about?
What girl?

59:35.178 --> 59:37.305
Some girl named toya was up
in what-a-burger

59:37.388 --> 59:40.516
talking about how she slept
with the whole line of lambda pledges?

59:42.768 --> 59:44.312
- Well?
- Well...

59:44.395 --> 59:45.396
Well, it ain't true.

59:51.736 --> 59:53.112
Okay, okay. Um...

59:53.529 --> 59:54.447
All right.

59:54.530 --> 59:56.908
There was a girl there,
but I didn't sleep with her.

59:56.991 --> 59:58.534
Other guys did, but I didn't.

59:59.869 --> 01:00:00.869
Okay?

01:00:03.456 --> 01:00:04.707
Look, you gotta believe me.

01:00:07.877 --> 01:00:09.128
Look, I've come this far.

01:00:09.712 --> 01:00:11.881
And after that, I'm all yours.
I done told you.

01:00:14.258 --> 01:00:16.344
Do you remember when we met last semester?

01:00:18.554 --> 01:00:22.183
How we stayed up all night,
talking about our hopes and dreams?

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:26.729
- I couldn't wait to get to know you...
- Please.

01:00:27.146 --> 01:00:29.398
- Don't try and talk me out of this.
- Zurich.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400
We're done.

01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:38.282
Please don't do this.

01:00:39.533 --> 01:00:40.743
Why are we doing this?

01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:42.911
Huh?

01:00:44.205 --> 01:00:45.539
- Why are we doing this?
- Dog.

01:00:45.623 --> 01:00:47.250
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hey, Zee.

01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:48.876
Zee, the car waiting.

01:00:52.838 --> 01:00:53.838
Go.

01:00:54.715 --> 01:00:56.008
Your bro's calling.

01:00:58.511 --> 01:00:59.679
Come on, the car waiting.

01:01:00.221 --> 01:01:02.223
The car waiting. Come on.
We gotta go, Dawg.

01:01:20.032 --> 01:01:22.368
Zee, you breathing heavy. You all right?

01:01:22.618 --> 01:01:23.661
I'm fine.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.621
Everybody good? Square, you good?

01:01:25.705 --> 01:01:27.105
- You holding up?
- I'm good.

01:01:27.164 --> 01:01:28.666
- Don't be scared.
- Shut up.

01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:29.583
- Hey.
- Fuck you, man.

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:31.043
- What you...?
- Ain't talking to you.

01:01:31.127 --> 01:01:32.127
Shh.

01:01:48.978 --> 01:01:54.400
Let's get this ass-whooping going, guys.

01:01:59.655 --> 01:02:00.781
Pick it up.

01:02:03.868 --> 01:02:05.286
What are y'all doing?

01:02:06.537 --> 01:02:08.998
Squat!

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:13.794
I don't wanna see any ass
on the fucking floor. Do you hear me?

01:02:13.878 --> 01:02:15.212
- Yes, big brother.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:16.922
On your feet.

01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:27.933
- Greet your big brothers.
- Greetings, big brother.

01:02:28.017 --> 01:02:30.227
Pain is the mind-killer. A little evil
that disseminates from the inside out.

01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:32.021
We must learn to face and control it.

01:02:34.899 --> 01:02:37.318
Hey, quit, number 4.

01:02:39.862 --> 01:02:41.364
Move forward 'til I say stop.

01:02:46.619 --> 01:02:47.619
Move.

01:02:50.998 --> 01:02:52.083
Let's go, mutts.

01:03:15.439 --> 01:03:16.439
Turn around.

01:03:17.525 --> 01:03:20.236
Don't remove
your motherfucking blindfold, mutt.

01:03:20.319 --> 01:03:23.364
Turn the fuck around!

01:03:23.447 --> 01:03:25.282
Y'all think this shit is a game?

01:03:26.742 --> 01:03:29.495
<i>"If there is no struggle,
there is no progress.</i>

01:03:31.455 --> 01:03:35.000
<i>Those who profess to favor freedom
and yet depreciate agitation,</i>

01:03:36.293 --> 01:03:38.421
<i>they want rain
without thunder and lightning.</i>

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.756
<i>They want the ocean</i>

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.925
<i>"without the awful roar
of its many waters."</i>

01:03:48.764 --> 01:03:51.350
I hope they're done with us for tonight.

01:03:51.434 --> 01:03:54.437
Look at crack baby eating
chicken wings like it's crack and shit.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.604
Leave him alone.

01:03:55.688 --> 01:03:57.064
Man, he's hungry.

01:03:57.898 --> 01:04:00.459
Yo, I'll bet you ain't had
no chicken wings in your life.

01:04:00.526 --> 01:04:03.237
Just Sushi and shit.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.405
Yo, wait, wait.

01:04:04.488 --> 01:04:06.866
You'll get a bucket of Sushi for $9.99?

01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:10.648
- What you trying to say, frank?
- I'm saying you ain't no real Nigga, bro.

01:04:11.912 --> 01:04:14.874
Yo, both of y'all just shut
the hell up. All right? We need to...

01:04:15.374 --> 01:04:16.876
We need to be focused.

01:04:16.959 --> 01:04:18.586
Man, shut the fuck up, man.

01:04:18.669 --> 01:04:21.630
And tell me something
I don't know, Nigga.

01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:26.144
Call me a Nigga in that tone
of voice again, bro, or any one of us...

01:04:26.218 --> 01:04:27.428
Don't touch me.

01:04:27.511 --> 01:04:28.679
Get that hand out my face.

01:04:30.764 --> 01:04:32.850
- Get out.
- No, no, no. Come on.

01:04:32.933 --> 01:04:34.477
- Yo, what's up?
- Yo, Zee, Zee, Zee.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:38.189
Ain't nobody scared of you, Nigga.
Ain't nobody scared of your shit.

01:04:39.607 --> 01:04:40.983
- Hey, yo, yo, yo.
- Fuck you.

01:04:41.066 --> 01:04:42.318
What the fuck you doing?

01:04:42.401 --> 01:04:45.404
Supposed to wait in the fucking car
till the brothers call you. You know that.

01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:48.324
What's wrong with number 4?

01:04:48.407 --> 01:04:51.035
He's having trouble breathing
going on two days now, sir.

01:04:52.328 --> 01:04:53.368
Bro, you good?

01:04:54.038 --> 01:04:55.247
Can't breathe.

01:04:55.331 --> 01:04:56.331
Can't breathe.

01:04:56.665 --> 01:04:58.375
Yo, we done with y'all for the night.

01:05:00.336 --> 01:05:03.088
Number 3...
Take him to big brother Malcolm's.

01:05:03.172 --> 01:05:05.052
- I'll take him.
- Shut up.

01:05:05.341 --> 01:05:07.051
My orders are for number 3 to take him.

01:05:07.384 --> 01:05:08.745
- You hear me?
- All right.

01:05:22.775 --> 01:05:25.402
Yo, man, we been here
for over three hours, man.

01:05:29.031 --> 01:05:31.367
Brother Malcolm should be done
with his shift soon.

01:05:37.122 --> 01:05:39.083
I can't wait to be in a residency at a...

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.377
Big hospital like this.

01:05:42.878 --> 01:05:45.965
Look, man, don't talk.
Just concentrate on breathing, all right?

01:05:48.968 --> 01:05:49.968
Hmm.

01:05:51.345 --> 01:05:52.345
What?

01:05:52.638 --> 01:05:53.638
Well...

01:05:54.223 --> 01:05:56.850
- Nigga, I didn't know you cared.
- Nigga, please.

01:05:57.518 --> 01:05:59.603
You love me, Nigga. Just say it.

01:05:59.687 --> 01:06:01.897
Nigga, I hate you, all right?

01:06:06.026 --> 01:06:08.654
- Ow. Stop. Don't make me laugh.
- Then breathe. Breathe.

01:06:08.737 --> 01:06:11.448
- I'm trying, if you'd shut up.
- Hey, pass the preparation H

01:06:11.532 --> 01:06:13.242
for them hemorrhoids, all right?

01:06:14.493 --> 01:06:15.493
Oh, fuck.

01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:25.921
- Oh, shit.
- Let's bounce. Follow my car.

01:06:26.714 --> 01:06:28.340
- All right.
- Yo...

01:06:29.592 --> 01:06:30.843
Are you comfortable, bro?

01:06:30.926 --> 01:06:32.761
- Am I comfortable?
- Nigga, you good?

01:06:32.845 --> 01:06:35.347
Yes, Nigga, I'm good. I got this.

01:06:35.431 --> 01:06:36.473
All right. We out, man.

01:06:38.225 --> 01:06:41.426
- That Nigga scared the shit out of me.
- Came in like Batman, Nigga, from nowhere.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:44.230
Mm-hm.

01:06:47.901 --> 01:06:49.486
Yeah, you've got a fractured rib.

01:06:51.322 --> 01:06:54.158
It's the swelling in that area
that makes it hard to breathe.

01:06:55.951 --> 01:06:57.202
What does that mean?

01:06:57.286 --> 01:07:00.581
There's no way to put a cast
on a fractured rib. It's vulnerable.

01:07:01.248 --> 01:07:04.543
Rest and it'll heal on its own
in about... six weeks.

01:07:06.128 --> 01:07:07.421
What about hell night, man?

01:07:08.047 --> 01:07:10.424
I seen this a dozen times.
You gonna be fine.

01:07:11.091 --> 01:07:13.594
All right? I got painkillers
to get you through.

01:07:15.179 --> 01:07:18.849
Just stay away from blows to the ribs,
or you'll end up on the operating table.

01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:20.559
I'll talk to fernander.

01:07:21.143 --> 01:07:23.103
Now, let me get those painkillers for you.

01:07:28.108 --> 01:07:29.108
Damn.

01:07:57.012 --> 01:08:00.641
<i>This is rochon.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:08:02.142 --> 01:08:03.142
Hey.

01:08:05.312 --> 01:08:06.312
It's Zee.

01:08:06.939 --> 01:08:08.023
I just wanted to...

01:08:16.407 --> 01:08:18.242
- Is she in there?
- Yeah.

01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:21.036
Go on, then. Go get your woman back.

01:08:22.496 --> 01:08:24.331
I'll come with you, man. I got you, bro.

01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:29.086
- All right, man.
- Come on, let's go.

01:08:30.837 --> 01:08:33.006
- Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- What?

01:08:45.935 --> 01:08:47.145
Let's roll, man.

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:48.229
Bro, you sure?

01:08:50.733 --> 01:08:51.733
Look at her.

01:09:02.618 --> 01:09:05.122
- I don't wanna ruin it.
- Right, I dig you. We out.

01:09:05.663 --> 01:09:06.663
Let's go.

01:09:07.499 --> 01:09:08.834
- Let's roll.
- Come on.

01:09:20.429 --> 01:09:22.389
I think we should talk to Dean Richardson.

01:09:25.642 --> 01:09:28.145
What? You wanna quit now?

01:09:32.733 --> 01:09:34.234
Dude, are you...?

01:09:34.318 --> 01:09:36.819
Are you not aware of what it's like
for a guy like me?

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.529
What are you talking about?

01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:40.741
You're the smartest dude I know.

01:09:41.366 --> 01:09:43.660
Look, this place your parents got
for you...

01:09:45.078 --> 01:09:47.247
After graduation, it'll be straight.
You don't...

01:09:48.916 --> 01:09:50.584
You don't need a fraternity.

01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:53.877
What's my name?

01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:57.925
- What are you talking about?
- You call me square...

01:10:02.429 --> 01:10:03.806
But what's my real name?

01:10:08.435 --> 01:10:09.436
That's what I thought.

01:10:12.606 --> 01:10:13.690
But after hell night...

01:10:14.691 --> 01:10:16.735
Ain't nobody gonna mistake me
for a square.

01:10:19.822 --> 01:10:22.282
I'm not pledging for what I can get
after school...

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.369
I'm pledging for what I can get now.

01:10:27.621 --> 01:10:30.207
I'll be a brother,
and I'll have earned my respect.

01:10:31.416 --> 01:10:33.210
So, you go talk to the Dean alone.

01:10:36.171 --> 01:10:37.171
You hear me?

01:10:39.216 --> 01:10:40.216
I do.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.180
It's Ernest.

01:10:46.974 --> 01:10:47.975
Mm?

01:10:50.602 --> 01:10:51.979
My real name is Ernest.

01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:07.493
Ernest.

01:11:26.972 --> 01:11:32.144
Late papers arriving at my office tonight
after 8 P.M.

01:11:32.227 --> 01:11:34.187
Will be docked a half grade.

01:11:35.564 --> 01:11:39.693
Every day after that,
they will be docked a whole grade.

01:11:39.776 --> 01:11:40.777
Come on.

01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:42.279
We're in business.

01:11:44.281 --> 01:11:45.281
Thank you.

01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:48.159
Thank you.

01:11:51.747 --> 01:11:52.747
Zurich.

01:11:53.457 --> 01:11:54.457
Did you hear me?

01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:59.504
- Zurich?
- Yes.

01:11:59.588 --> 01:12:00.588
I heard you.

01:12:01.465 --> 01:12:02.465
What's up?

01:12:04.176 --> 01:12:05.636
Do you have a paper for me?

01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:20.650
Okay.

01:12:46.718 --> 01:12:47.718
Come in.

01:12:49.763 --> 01:12:51.181
Hey.

01:12:52.516 --> 01:12:53.516
Sit down.

01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:04.151
So, how's it going?

01:13:10.325 --> 01:13:11.618
It's tough, doc.

01:13:13.328 --> 01:13:15.209
About to lose my mind.

01:13:16.289 --> 01:13:19.584
It's like the minute night falls,
I get sick to my stomach, you know?

01:13:20.877 --> 01:13:24.965
Look, I would not have recommended you
if I didn't think you had what it takes

01:13:25.048 --> 01:13:26.425
to be a part of my fraternity.

01:13:27.634 --> 01:13:28.719
And there is a proud...

01:13:29.928 --> 01:13:32.889
Proud tradition of my frat,
and hopefully...

01:13:33.682 --> 01:13:34.933
This will be yours soon.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.600
Yes, sir.

01:13:38.895 --> 01:13:40.480
I'm glad you came by to see me.

01:13:40.897 --> 01:13:42.566
Now, you could come by any time,

01:13:42.691 --> 01:13:45.652
but today, you don't wanna keep
your line brothers waiting.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:54.119
Look, you don't know how it is, doc.

01:13:56.705 --> 01:13:58.832
I am not that old that I've forgotten.

01:13:59.958 --> 01:14:04.004
Humiliation builds humility,
and one more night is not gonna kill you.

01:14:04.087 --> 01:14:05.087
This I know.

01:14:07.507 --> 01:14:09.342
That is when pledging was above ground.

01:14:10.886 --> 01:14:12.304
It's not how it is anymore.

01:14:13.096 --> 01:14:16.099
After hazing became illegal,
it went underground, and...

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.520
Look, with all due respect,
Dean Richardson, I just...

01:14:21.063 --> 01:14:22.773
I don't think you understand

01:14:22.856 --> 01:14:24.775
that we need a change and we need it now,

01:14:24.858 --> 01:14:26.401
because the lives of our students

01:14:26.485 --> 01:14:29.321
and the honor of this fraternity
is at stake.

01:14:30.655 --> 01:14:32.407
So, you know, we Cee...

01:14:38.663 --> 01:14:41.458
You thought you was just gonna walk
into my frat, Zurich?

01:14:42.459 --> 01:14:44.628
You come in here and tell me
I don't know something?

01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:47.072
- That I don't understand?
- No, sir. That's not at all what...

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:49.633
Look, you are merely facing
what other men have met.

01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:54.638
- You know your poems?
- Yes, sir.

01:14:54.721 --> 01:14:56.848
<i>On your feet. Give me see it through.</i>

01:14:57.766 --> 01:14:59.926
"When you're up against trouble,
meet it face to face."

01:14:59.976 --> 01:15:01.728
Lift your chin and say short is pain
for me and take a brace.

01:15:01.812 --> 01:15:04.372
"When it's vain to try and dodge it,
do the best that you can do."

01:15:04.397 --> 01:15:05.838
"You may fail and may conquer.

01:15:05.899 --> 01:15:07.734
- "See it through."
- See it through!

01:15:09.528 --> 01:15:12.239
Now get out my office
and cross them burning sands,

01:15:12.322 --> 01:15:14.032
and I will see you on the other side.

01:15:45.605 --> 01:15:48.191
- Hey, yo, Zee not with you, man?
- No.

01:15:48.859 --> 01:15:51.653
I barely made it here from practice.

01:15:52.195 --> 01:15:53.989
He got... he got that paper due.

01:15:54.072 --> 01:15:55.657
- I'll try calling him.
- Please.

01:16:17.846 --> 01:16:21.016
<i>"If we ever get free from
the oppressions and wrongs heaped upon us,</i>

01:16:22.267 --> 01:16:24.060
<i>we must pay for the removal.</i>

01:16:24.936 --> 01:16:28.190
<i>We must do this by labor, by suffering,</i>

01:16:29.191 --> 01:16:32.027
<i>by sacrifice and if needs be,</i>

01:16:33.028 --> 01:16:34.863
<i>by our lives and the lives of others.</i>

01:16:39.951 --> 01:16:41.661
- He coming or not?
- He dropped.

01:16:41.745 --> 01:16:43.330
No, man, he'll be here, all right?

01:16:44.539 --> 01:16:45.539
Call him again.

01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:47.542
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

01:16:47.626 --> 01:16:50.086
- I got some apple pies for y'all.
- Let me get that.

01:16:50.503 --> 01:16:51.838
What's up? Where's Zurich at?

01:16:51.922 --> 01:16:55.133
- You ain't got no burgers to flip, man?
- You ain't got nowhere to be?

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:57.385
Yo, yo, yo.

01:16:57.802 --> 01:16:58.802
You got a boyfriend?

01:17:00.347 --> 01:17:02.349
- What's that got to do with you?
- You know.

01:17:03.683 --> 01:17:05.018
We'll be done tomorrow.

01:17:06.686 --> 01:17:10.190
- Bye, boys. Have a good night.
- Hey. Thank you for the pies.

01:17:10.273 --> 01:17:11.273
You're welcome.

01:17:16.446 --> 01:17:19.157
- We gotta go now.
- No, hold on. Just a bit more, all right?

01:18:24.514 --> 01:18:27.434
- Yo, dude, what the fuck, man?
- Glad y'all could make it.

01:18:28.685 --> 01:18:30.228
- Come on, bro.
- My fault, my fault.

01:18:30.312 --> 01:18:32.022
What's up, boy?

01:18:33.815 --> 01:18:35.025
- What's up, boy?
- What's up?

01:18:35.108 --> 01:18:35.942
- Man.
- What up?

01:18:36.026 --> 01:18:37.193
- I thought you dropped.
- Yeah.

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:38.557
Let my boys down? Are you crazy?

01:18:38.611 --> 01:18:39.946
- No.
- Motherfucker, man.

01:18:40.447 --> 01:18:41.447
Mother...?

01:18:42.032 --> 01:18:43.241
Did he just cuss?

01:18:43.325 --> 01:18:44.868
He just cussed, man.

01:18:44.951 --> 01:18:46.411
Zee, can you just get in the car?

01:18:46.494 --> 01:18:48.955
Okay, hold on.
Can y'all come here, real quick?

01:18:49.039 --> 01:18:50.040
- Come here.
- What, man?

01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:51.791
I just... come here.

01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:54.836
I just want us to take a moment
to remember where you're from.

01:18:54.919 --> 01:18:55.754
Can we do that?

01:18:55.837 --> 01:18:57.547
You know I'm from here. Let's go.

01:18:57.630 --> 01:18:59.591
We are not from here.
We are not from here.

01:19:00.133 --> 01:19:02.218
Detroit, New Orleans, D.C.

01:19:03.261 --> 01:19:04.596
Where you from again, square?

01:19:04.929 --> 01:19:06.514
- Indianapolis?
- Indianapolis.

01:19:06.806 --> 01:19:07.891
We are not from here.

01:19:08.683 --> 01:19:10.852
Nor are the brothers of this fraternity,
I ask you again,

01:19:10.935 --> 01:19:12.562
do you know where we are from?

01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:16.231
Huh?

01:19:18.234 --> 01:19:20.737
We come from kings and queens, man.
Not slaves.

01:19:21.404 --> 01:19:23.948
You, you, you, you. Kings.

01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:29.079
After we cross them burning sands,
we will act as such.

01:19:29.162 --> 01:19:31.164
We are gonna treat each other
with respect,

01:19:31.247 --> 01:19:33.917
our pledge brothers before us
and our pledge brothers to come.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.877
With respect, honor, dignity.

01:19:36.294 --> 01:19:38.463
All of that, man,
because we earned this shit.

01:19:41.883 --> 01:19:43.009
I love y'all, man.

01:19:45.303 --> 01:19:46.805
Can I get an amen, brothers?

01:19:47.472 --> 01:19:48.472
Amen!

01:19:48.515 --> 01:19:49.349
- Yeah.
- Amen.

01:19:49.432 --> 01:19:50.633
- Right.
- Shit.

01:19:50.683 --> 01:19:51.518
Let's ride, man.

01:21:17.145 --> 01:21:18.145
Give me that.

01:21:18.688 --> 01:21:19.688
I got it.

01:21:23.776 --> 01:21:26.070
You handle that pump
like you handled toya?

01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:30.700
Ernest, you gonna answer frank?

01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:34.431
I'm gonna be real,
I didn't smash toya.

01:21:34.496 --> 01:21:35.496
What?

01:21:35.622 --> 01:21:36.664
I didn't do it.

01:21:36.748 --> 01:21:38.291
- I'm still a virgin.
- What?

01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:40.960
Hey, yo, I tapped that, yo.

01:21:41.044 --> 01:21:42.504
Right. Of course. Sure you did.

01:21:42.587 --> 01:21:45.381
I sure hell did. I was like,
"boom! Boom! Boom!"

01:21:48.551 --> 01:21:49.385
Wait, wait, wait.

01:21:49.469 --> 01:21:50.929
Wait, wait. Hold up, hold up.

01:21:56.684 --> 01:21:59.312
I wanted to...

01:21:59.395 --> 01:22:00.395
What?

01:22:02.774 --> 01:22:05.610
Toya's smart. If I was her,
I wouldn't touch square either.

01:22:05.693 --> 01:22:08.279
- Whoa, what do you mean?
- Give me a second.

01:22:08.363 --> 01:22:11.950
She's grand, noble, sublime.

01:22:12.659 --> 01:22:14.327
- She's what?
- Sublime.

01:22:14.619 --> 01:22:16.100
The last word. Sub...

01:22:16.162 --> 01:22:19.165
Sublime. You know what I mean.
