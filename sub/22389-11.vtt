â™ª â™ª

00:18.500 --> 00:21.500
[cheers and applause]

00:21.500 --> 00:24.800
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:24.800 --> 00:27.870
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:27.870 --> 00:30.870
[cheers and applause]

00:30.870 --> 00:35.270
â™ª â™ª

00:35.270 --> 00:37.030
- Thank you.

00:37.030 --> 00:40.369
[cheers and applause]

00:40.369 --> 00:42.200
Thank you.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.570
Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

00:46.570 --> 00:48.670
The premise of this show
is so simple,

00:48.670 --> 00:50.600
even my three-year-old gets it.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.429
A magic guy tries to do a sneaky
on two other magic guys,

00:54.429 --> 00:56.829
and if they do,
they get a lollipop,

00:56.829 --> 00:58.399
and they get to perform

00:58.399 --> 01:01.070
in Penn and Teller's
famous magic show.

01:01.070 --> 01:03.770
Now, before you start
getting fidgety,

01:03.770 --> 01:06.670
here they are,
the bad, bad boys of magic,

01:06.670 --> 01:08.569
Penn and Teller!

01:08.569 --> 01:11.329
[cheers and applause]

01:11.329 --> 01:14.170
- Hey.
Hey, you.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.469
I love your dress.
I love your dress.

01:16.469 --> 01:17.900
Your dress looks beautiful.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.799
[cheers and applause]

01:19.799 --> 01:22.530
- Whoo.
- How you doing?

01:22.530 --> 01:23.670
- Yep.
- Who's here?

01:23.670 --> 01:25.599
[cheers and applause]

01:25.599 --> 01:27.799
- Whoo-hoo!

01:27.799 --> 01:30.129
As always, Penn and Teller
have no idea

01:30.129 --> 01:32.500
who any of the performers are
ahead of time,

01:32.500 --> 01:35.530
so let's give them
their first surprise.

01:37.530 --> 01:38.530
- I'm Jim Leach.

01:38.530 --> 01:39.870
- And I'm Christopher Tracy.

01:39.870 --> 01:41.270
And together, we are...

01:41.270 --> 01:42.370
- Jim Leach
and Christopher Tracy.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.500
- Exactly.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.870
Me and Jim
have known each other

01:44.870 --> 01:46.629
for about 25 years.

01:46.629 --> 01:48.370
- We have a similar
sense of humor.

01:48.370 --> 01:50.000
We share a passion for magic.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.670
- I would describe my magic
as zany

01:52.670 --> 01:53.900
and insane on some levels.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.930
- My approach to magic

01:54.930 --> 01:56.370
is a little bit more classical

01:56.370 --> 01:57.530
as opposed to Christopher,

01:57.530 --> 01:59.569
who's a little loud,
off-putting.

01:59.569 --> 02:00.900
- He's short.
I'm tall.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.129
He's obnoxious,
and I'm the nice guy.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.129
[rock music]

02:04.129 --> 02:05.299
- I imagine Penn and Teller

02:05.299 --> 02:06.500
will be very impressed with me

02:06.500 --> 02:07.969
and creeped out by him.

02:07.969 --> 02:09.229
- What?

02:09.229 --> 02:12.930
[cheers and applause]

02:12.930 --> 02:14.069
- Please welcome

02:14.069 --> 02:18.030
Christopher Tracy and Jim Leach.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.129
- Hi.
My name's Hal.

02:19.129 --> 02:20.229
This is my partner, Kellar.

02:20.229 --> 02:21.800
We are Hal and Kellar,

02:21.800 --> 02:22.900
two eccentric guys

02:22.900 --> 02:25.500
who've learned to do
a few cool things.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.930
My partner Kellar here
is psychic.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.729
He's placed a prediction
in this envelope.

02:30.729 --> 02:33.129
That will be important shortly.

02:33.129 --> 02:34.770
We also have a deck of cards,

02:34.770 --> 02:37.229
and we need two helpers.

02:37.229 --> 02:38.629
How about you two
in the VIP seats?

02:38.629 --> 02:40.300
Would you mind joining us
up here?

02:40.300 --> 02:43.300
[cheers and applause]

02:44.829 --> 02:45.969
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

02:45.969 --> 02:47.129
What's your name?
- My name is Penn.

02:47.129 --> 02:48.569
- Nice to meet you.
And you are?

02:49.800 --> 02:50.800
Okay.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.699
[laughter]

02:52.699 --> 02:54.199
You guys know how to shuffle?

02:54.199 --> 02:55.670
- I do.
- You do? Excellent.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.069
We'll get you both
involved, then.

02:57.069 --> 02:59.500
We'll give you--
we'll cut the cards in half.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.569
- Okay.

03:03.969 --> 03:05.229
- Okay, fine.

03:07.800 --> 03:08.800
That's better.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.129
Close enough.

03:10.129 --> 03:11.930
Go ahead and shuffle those,
if you don't mind,

03:11.930 --> 03:13.400
and you can shuffle these.
- Okay.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.500
- Shuffle till you're happy.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.629
Happy with the mixture
of the cards,

03:15.629 --> 03:16.629
not life in general.

03:16.629 --> 03:17.829
We don't have that kind of time.

03:17.829 --> 03:18.829
- Okay.

03:18.829 --> 03:20.770
[laughter]

03:20.770 --> 03:22.199
- Nicely done.

03:22.199 --> 03:24.170
Now, I'd like you
to help me out some more.

03:24.170 --> 03:27.229
Cut the cards into two
approximately equal piles.

03:27.229 --> 03:29.430
They don't have to be exact.
You don't have to count them.

03:29.430 --> 03:31.569
Counting tricks
are inherently boring.

03:31.569 --> 03:33.530
And you do the same.
Cut those into two piles.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.099
Excellent.

03:36.099 --> 03:39.629
Now, we're about to do something
most magicians won't do.

03:39.629 --> 03:41.569
I'm going to point out

03:41.569 --> 03:43.569
the fact that we're going to do
the trick move.

03:43.569 --> 03:45.870
Now, normally, when
a run-of-the-mill magician,

03:45.870 --> 03:48.430
or rabbit-pullers,
as we like to call them--

03:48.430 --> 03:50.400
when a rabbit puller
does the tricky move,

03:50.400 --> 03:51.969
they try to distract you

03:51.969 --> 03:53.469
with misdirection.

03:53.469 --> 03:55.270
They'll have
a gorgeous showgirl come out

03:55.270 --> 03:58.430
or some short, quiet,
creepy guy.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.930
Um.

03:59.930 --> 04:01.900
But my partner Kellar
is the world's greatest

04:01.900 --> 04:03.400
sleight of hand artist,

04:03.400 --> 04:05.699
so we're actually gonna call
attention to the tricky move.

04:05.699 --> 04:08.330
Would you hand me
either of those piles?

04:08.330 --> 04:09.330
Excellent.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.669
Hand me either of those piles.

04:11.669 --> 04:12.729
Outstanding.

04:12.729 --> 04:14.669
My partner will now do...

04:14.669 --> 04:16.230
the tricky move.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.569
That was outstanding.

04:23.569 --> 04:26.100
I've never been more proud
to be this man's partner.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.769
That was outstanding.

04:27.769 --> 04:29.970
All right, now, do this.
Do as I do.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.370
Just take those cards

04:31.370 --> 04:33.529
and shuffle them together
like that,

04:33.529 --> 04:35.329
faceup into facedown,

04:35.329 --> 04:37.029
creating a mess,

04:37.029 --> 04:38.970
and I don't want
to leave you out.

04:38.970 --> 04:40.170
Go ahead and take both piles

04:40.170 --> 04:42.800
and shuffle them together
as well.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.100
Nicely done.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.930
Now, I've shuffled the cards.

04:45.930 --> 04:48.100
You've shuffled the cards.
You've shuffled the cards.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.670
I think you'd agree
that the cards are a mess.

04:50.670 --> 04:53.069
Let's consult
my partner's prediction.

04:53.069 --> 04:55.930
My partner Kellar
has predicted...

04:55.930 --> 04:57.370
that the cards...

04:59.300 --> 05:01.100
Let's check.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.800
They are a mess.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.329
Now, your typical rabbit-puller
would end the trick there,

05:05.329 --> 05:06.600
because it's a prediction,

05:06.600 --> 05:07.769
and it's successful.

05:07.769 --> 05:09.769
[laughter]

05:09.769 --> 05:11.529
But wait.
There's more.

05:13.199 --> 05:14.670
Kellar predicted that...

05:17.370 --> 05:18.370
Let's check.

05:18.370 --> 05:21.500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

05:21.500 --> 05:23.269
6, 7, 8, 9--

05:23.269 --> 05:24.269
- Good counting.

05:24.269 --> 05:27.329
- 10, 11, 12,

05:27.329 --> 05:30.470
13, 14, 15, 16,

05:30.470 --> 05:32.769
17, 18, 19,

05:32.769 --> 05:36.829
20, 21, 22, 23.

05:36.829 --> 05:39.069
Exactly 23 cards...

05:39.069 --> 05:41.230
are facedown.

05:41.230 --> 05:43.329
That's a good trick, Kellar.
How'd you do it?

05:49.170 --> 05:51.430
My partner has predicted
that of these,

05:51.430 --> 05:53.730
there are exactly 12 cards...

05:53.730 --> 05:54.730
that are red.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.100
If you pull this off, buddy--

05:56.100 --> 05:57.870
that's good.
That's good.

05:57.870 --> 05:59.199
Let's check.

06:02.199 --> 06:06.329
1, 2, 3, 4,

06:06.329 --> 06:09.269
5, 6, 7, 8,

06:09.269 --> 06:14.029
9, 10, 11, 12.

06:14.029 --> 06:17.370
Exactly 12 cards are red.

06:17.370 --> 06:19.670
[applause]

06:19.670 --> 06:20.670
That's good.

06:20.670 --> 06:25.029
But wait.
There's more.

06:25.029 --> 06:28.500
My partner predicts
that all of the black cards

06:28.500 --> 06:30.029
are spades.

06:30.029 --> 06:31.399
Check it out.

06:31.399 --> 06:34.100
Spade.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.230
Spade.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.230
Spade.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.000
Spade.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.230
Spade.

06:41.230 --> 06:42.230
Spade.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.430
Spade.

06:43.430 --> 06:44.699
Spade.

06:44.699 --> 06:45.829
Spade.

06:45.829 --> 06:47.569
S--what?

06:56.430 --> 06:59.430
[cheers and applause]

07:02.529 --> 07:04.230
Thank you.

07:04.230 --> 07:06.629
- Wow, Tracy and Leach.

07:06.629 --> 07:07.629
Wow.

07:07.629 --> 07:08.730
That was really impressive.

07:08.730 --> 07:09.870
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

07:09.870 --> 07:11.629
- So do you guys tour

07:11.629 --> 07:13.600
as Hal and Kellar?
- No.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
- Well, we just

07:14.600 --> 07:15.600
came up with a crazy idea.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.600
- Yeah.
- We live in

07:16.600 --> 07:17.600
two different states.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
- Man, that must have been

07:18.600 --> 07:19.829
a challenge to rehearse

07:19.829 --> 07:21.769
without being in the same room.

07:21.769 --> 07:23.600
- Yeah.
- We had a few opportunities,

07:23.600 --> 07:26.129
but most of it was
electronic communication.

07:26.129 --> 07:27.269
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:27.269 --> 07:28.899
- That's incredible.
both: Thank you.

07:28.899 --> 07:30.329
- And why did you switch it up

07:30.329 --> 07:33.000
and have the tall one
be the quiet--

07:33.000 --> 07:34.600
- Be the quiet one?
For that reason.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.899
- All right.
- We just wanted to--

07:35.899 --> 07:37.129
- Switch it up.
- Parody it.

07:37.129 --> 07:38.529
- Yep, yep.
- All right.

07:38.529 --> 07:40.670
And do you think they'll take it
as the loving gesture

07:40.670 --> 07:42.329
that it's intended?
- I certainly hope so.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.970
Like I said,
we're just enormous fans.

07:43.970 --> 07:44.970
Big fans of theirs.
- Aww.

07:44.970 --> 07:45.970
All right.

07:45.970 --> 07:47.629
Penn, Teller.

07:47.629 --> 07:48.670
Boys.

07:48.670 --> 07:49.930
Hello.

07:49.930 --> 07:52.329
- Yeah, boy, what a weird idea,

07:52.329 --> 07:54.899
to have the little guy talking.

07:54.899 --> 07:57.829
Just so--such a weird-ass idea.

07:57.829 --> 07:58.829
- [laughing]

07:58.829 --> 08:00.829
- Thank you.

08:00.829 --> 08:02.930
- We're very, very,
very flattered

08:02.930 --> 08:04.170
by the parody.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.769
Very, very funny.
- Thank you.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.629
- And, you know--I don't know if
you've worked the cruise ships,

08:07.629 --> 08:08.629
but you've been on 'em, right?

08:08.629 --> 08:09.730
- Yeah.
- I work it.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.629
- You know, a lot of times,
they have

08:11.629 --> 08:13.399
older people on cruise ships,
don't they?

08:13.399 --> 08:14.629
- Yeah.
- What games do they play

08:14.629 --> 08:16.100
on cruise ships?

08:16.100 --> 08:17.899
- Chess.
- Chess, they'll play chess.

08:17.899 --> 08:19.000
Sure.
- Shuffleboard.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.100
- Bowling.
- Shuffleboard.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.870
And they even play...

08:22.870 --> 08:24.870
Simon--
- Simon Says.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.029
- Simon Says, yeah.
- Yeah.

08:26.029 --> 08:27.529
- Simon Says.

08:27.529 --> 08:29.370
Simon Says, and the--
this is kind of

08:29.370 --> 08:31.730
a cruise ship-y kind of trick,
in that way, doesn't it?

08:31.730 --> 08:33.000
I mean--
- I--I got it, yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.669
- As we went on, there was
a cruise ship director

08:35.669 --> 08:37.769
named Aronson, wasn't there?
On the ship?

08:37.769 --> 08:39.299
- I don't know.
I didn't go with you.

08:39.299 --> 08:40.500
- Yeah, well, the cruise ship
we went on...

08:40.500 --> 08:42.230
- But I can imagine
there would be, yeah.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.629
- Had that one too.
- Yeah.

08:43.629 --> 08:45.370
- But it's a good ship,
wasn't it?

08:45.370 --> 08:46.370
- A great, great ship.

08:46.370 --> 08:49.129
- Really, really, really
good ship.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.429
- Is he trying to go on vacation
with you guys,

08:51.429 --> 08:53.330
or does this
mean something to you?

08:53.330 --> 08:54.929
- Sounds good to me.
- I'm hitting on them.

08:54.929 --> 08:57.129
- I knew exactly what he said.
- Okay.

08:57.129 --> 09:00.929
Okay, so you're cool
with whatever he's saying,

09:00.929 --> 09:02.799
and you did not fool them.
- Cool with what he's saying.

09:02.799 --> 09:04.029
We did not fool them.
- No.

09:04.029 --> 09:06.899
- I suspect by his specificity,

09:06.899 --> 09:09.330
it would have fooled him if he
wasn't already familiar with it.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.970
- I actually
did work on that trick,

09:10.970 --> 09:12.429
and I actually have
a version of it...

09:12.429 --> 09:13.970
- Oh, see, I never knew that.
- So I did know a little bit

09:13.970 --> 09:14.970
about--yeah.

09:14.970 --> 09:16.330
[all laughing]

09:16.330 --> 09:17.370
- All right.
- All right.

09:17.370 --> 09:19.100
Well, it is hard to...
- Thank you.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.470
- Fool the smartest guys
in magic.

09:20.470 --> 09:22.200
- Well, could we just do this--
- So thank you very much.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.830
- Could we just pose with them?

09:24.830 --> 09:26.769
I just want to pose with them.
- Oh, definitely.

09:26.769 --> 09:29.000
- I want to get
this look done right here.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.129
- Yeah.
- Selfie.

09:30.129 --> 09:32.470

for our next fooler.

10:04.529 --> 10:05.830
- My name's Neil Croswell,

10:05.830 --> 10:08.429
and I specialize in stage magic
and grand illusion.

10:08.429 --> 10:09.500
[upbeat music]

10:09.500 --> 10:10.870
In Toronto, where I grew up,

10:10.870 --> 10:12.299
it's very urbanized,

10:12.299 --> 10:15.070
so I have a very urban
approach to magic.

10:15.070 --> 10:17.700
I like to pull inspiration
from hip-hop culture,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.600
music, movies.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.870
My first gig, I got a gig
at a restaurant

10:21.870 --> 10:23.570
where I'd go around
and show tricks,

10:23.570 --> 10:25.870
so they'd see a little kid
come up in a tuxedo.

10:25.870 --> 10:28.169
99% of the time,
I got laughed at,

10:28.169 --> 10:31.470
but I really learned
that life isn't always jolly.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.029
You know, if you
really want something,

10:33.029 --> 10:34.299
you've got to work at it,

10:34.299 --> 10:36.169

I was in Magic of China

10:37.769 --> 10:40.429
where I was fortunate enough
to bring home the gold there.

10:40.429 --> 10:42.629
I can bring joy to people.
I don't need to say a word.

10:42.629 --> 10:45.029
I can go anywhere in the world,

My name is Neil Croswell.

11:00.399 --> 11:02.100
This is my assistant Ashley,

11:02.100 --> 11:03.970
and, well, like most women,
Ashley--

11:03.970 --> 11:05.370
she loves to shop,

11:05.370 --> 11:06.899
and whenever we go
shopping together,

11:06.899 --> 11:09.529
she always performs
her favorite magic trick:

11:09.529 --> 11:11.629
making all the money
in my pocket disappear.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.629
[laughter]

11:12.629 --> 11:13.799
Take last week, for example.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.730
We went shopping,
and she found a brand-new dress

11:15.730 --> 11:16.870
she wanted to buy.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.500
The only problem was
that she couldn't decide

11:18.500 --> 11:20.230
if she wanted to get it
in the color red

11:20.230 --> 11:22.200
or if she wanted to get it
in the color blue,

11:22.200 --> 11:23.929
so me, being a magician,

11:23.929 --> 11:25.769
I told her to buy both
of the dresses,

11:25.769 --> 11:27.970
and I came up with a way
to help her make up her mind.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.970
Hi, nice to see you.
- Hi.

14:20.970 --> 14:22.070
- That was really cool.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.100
- Oh, thanks.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.830
- I wish I could shop that way.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.470
- Yeah.

14:26.470 --> 14:28.899
- So you guys are actually
a couple in real life,

14:28.899 --> 14:30.070
is that correct?
- Yes we are.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.529
Yeah, yeah, we are a couple.
- Aw.

14:31.529 --> 14:33.330
- Partners on- and offstage

14:33.330 --> 14:35.399
for just about five
and a half years now.

14:35.399 --> 14:36.970
Pretty much since
we've been together,

14:36.970 --> 14:38.769
we've been doing magic
together, so...

14:38.769 --> 14:40.299
- That is so sweet.
- Yeah.

14:40.299 --> 14:42.700
When we met, I actually didn't
even tell her I did magic,

14:42.700 --> 14:46.330
because I thought it was sort of
a lame way to pick up a girl,

14:46.330 --> 14:48.769
and so she found out,
and she came over to my house,

14:48.769 --> 14:51.529
and I had an illusion that I'd
bought from another magician.

14:51.529 --> 14:52.799
I'd never used a girl,

14:52.799 --> 14:55.070
and she saw it, and she said,
"Neil, what does this do?"

14:55.070 --> 14:56.629
And it was, like,
a lightbulb moment for me.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.730
I'd never had a girl
in it before.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.830
I said, "Well, why
don't you get in?

14:58.830 --> 14:59.899
I'll show you."

14:59.899 --> 15:02.200
And so she got in.
I tried it out.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.700
She fit perfectly.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.399
She comes out, and she goes,

15:05.399 --> 15:06.529
"Do you got any more?"

15:06.529 --> 15:09.470
- Aww.
- So it worked out perfect.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.330
- Is that the moment
you knew you were in love?

15:11.330 --> 15:12.600
- I think so, definitely.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.970
And yeah, now she's doing magic
of her own,

15:14.970 --> 15:16.299
and it's all sorts of fun.

15:16.299 --> 15:17.370
- Aw, that's sweet.
- Yeah.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.570
- All right.
Boys.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.570
- Yeah?
- Time's up.

15:20.570 --> 15:22.169
- Nice act, nice version.

15:22.169 --> 15:24.000
I always like to point out stuff

15:24.000 --> 15:26.500
that's better than people
at home might think.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.600
We have everything set up
to be done onstage,

15:28.600 --> 15:29.970
just facing one direction.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.169
I believe you can do this thing
in the round,

15:32.169 --> 15:33.970
which is very, very rare...
- Yep.

15:33.970 --> 15:34.970
- For an illusion.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.629
That's a beautiful thing
in that,

15:36.629 --> 15:38.730
because a lot of times,
magicians are stuck

15:38.730 --> 15:40.399
only working out there

15:40.399 --> 15:42.500
with everything kind of
almost in two dimensions.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.299
This, you can move cameras
all the way around.

15:44.299 --> 15:45.970
You can--you can spin
that thing around.

15:45.970 --> 15:47.899
You're completely safe
from everywhere.

15:47.899 --> 15:49.769
We think--
but don't hold us to this.

15:49.769 --> 15:50.970
This isn't the whole thing.

15:50.970 --> 15:52.269
We think this is a Steinmeyer,

15:52.269 --> 15:53.669
that did the version of this.
- Yep.

15:53.669 --> 15:54.899
Yep, that's correct.

15:54.899 --> 15:57.330
- But that's not enough
to tell you, you know.

15:57.330 --> 16:01.200
It's funny, because
we're wearing suits here,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.000
and you're wearing
kind of a hoodie,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.629
and some would say
you're underdressed,

16:04.629 --> 16:06.500
but in a modern version
like this,

16:06.500 --> 16:09.570
I don't think either you
or Ashley were underdressed

16:09.570 --> 16:10.570
for the situation.

16:10.570 --> 16:11.669
We have a little drawing
for you...

16:11.669 --> 16:12.669
- Sure.
- That Teller would like

16:12.669 --> 16:14.500
to show you, and also,

16:14.500 --> 16:17.070
you know, Alyson, that whole
striped-dress thing...

16:17.070 --> 16:18.299
- Yeah.
- Is rather new.

16:18.299 --> 16:19.700
They wouldn't do that
in the old version.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.870
- No?
- Not in the old version.

16:20.870 --> 16:23.399
- Why?
- Because it's a new idea.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.269
And we'll just--
why don't you give--

16:25.269 --> 16:26.600
why don't you let Alyson see?
- Oh.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.769
- Okay, you got a little--

16:27.769 --> 16:29.230
got a little shot of that
right there,

16:29.230 --> 16:30.429
so it'll be put safely in a--

16:30.429 --> 16:31.669
- Wait, so did--

16:31.669 --> 16:33.269
He didn't--
- Put it very safely in there.

16:33.269 --> 16:34.629
- So he didn't fool you?

16:34.629 --> 16:36.029
- No, unfortunately,
they didn't,

16:36.029 --> 16:37.330
but it's been an honor
to be here.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.330

I had a massive stroke.

I was not supposed to walk,
talk, or roll over.

in the tuxedo.

or uncomfortable,

Before I do any magic,

18:23.230 --> 18:24.470
I'm actually going
to read the minds

18:24.470 --> 18:25.630
of everybody here.

18:25.630 --> 18:29.569
So to answer your question...

18:29.569 --> 18:32.630
yes, I am older than I look.

18:32.630 --> 18:33.799
I'm 12.

- [laughs]
- Thank you.

It's also a napkin.

18:49.799 --> 18:50.970
Magicians are weird.

18:50.970 --> 18:52.200
You're gonna
have to get used to that.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.769
No, magicians
have to be weird, though,

18:53.769 --> 18:55.099
because we have to take
normal things,

18:55.099 --> 18:57.430
and we have to turn them
inside out, upside down,

18:57.430 --> 18:58.769
twist them all around to create

18:58.769 --> 19:01.829
unexpected and amazing magic
for all of you.

19:01.829 --> 19:04.200
So are you guys ready
to get weird?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.970
Yeah, let's do this.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.069
All right, so I need to borrow

19:07.069 --> 19:08.170
a phone, and I was wondering,

19:08.170 --> 19:09.569
do either of you have a phone?
- I do.

19:09.569 --> 19:10.670
- Penn, do you have a phone
on you?

19:10.670 --> 19:11.670
- I'm not supposed to.

19:11.670 --> 19:12.970
- No, are you texting
during the show?

19:12.970 --> 19:14.200
- I'll be reprimanded for this,
but yes, I do.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.569
- Okay.
- I have mine.

19:15.569 --> 19:17.970
- Well, if the trick goes south,
you can always start texting.

19:17.970 --> 19:19.000
It's okay.
I forgive you.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.069
You can tweet if you want to.

19:20.069 --> 19:21.529
Do you mind if I

19:21.529 --> 19:22.630
go through your phone?
- No.

19:22.630 --> 19:23.829
- Okay, good.
You don't have a choice.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.170
- I have no secrets
from you, Ben, nothing.

19:25.170 --> 19:26.470
- Okay, good.

19:26.470 --> 19:28.029
Thanks for remembering my name.

19:28.029 --> 19:31.730
[laughter]

19:31.730 --> 19:32.730
Um, can I take a selfie?

19:32.730 --> 19:33.769
Is that okay?
- Sure, please.

19:33.769 --> 19:35.099
- Okay, perfect.
- I want to see that.

19:35.099 --> 19:36.529
- You're gonna be
really happy to have that one.

19:36.529 --> 19:38.970
- I am.
- Not today.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.569
We're gonna use your calculator.
- Sure.

19:40.569 --> 19:42.730
- We're actually going to
generate a large number.

19:42.730 --> 19:44.299
So would you put in
a four-digit number?

19:44.299 --> 19:45.700
Something random,
something big.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.069
- Okay.
- Four digits.

19:49.369 --> 19:51.299
- Perfect.
Hit Times.

19:51.299 --> 19:53.099
- Times.
- Times, perfect.

19:53.099 --> 19:55.970
Teller, you're gonna put in
a three-digit number.

19:55.970 --> 19:59.170
Something random,
something big.

19:59.170 --> 20:01.569
Perfect.
Hit Times again.

20:01.569 --> 20:03.730
All right, and Alyson is going
to give the last number.

20:03.730 --> 20:04.900
Alyson, would you
join me onstage?

20:04.900 --> 20:05.970
- Sure.
- Thank you so much.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.630
Alyson Hannigan,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:07.630 --> 20:09.329
- Aw, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

20:09.329 --> 20:10.329
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

20:10.329 --> 20:11.470
- Yes.
- Are you excited?

20:11.470 --> 20:12.730
You're gonna finish off
the number.

20:12.730 --> 20:14.369
- Ooh, exciting, yes.
- It's a big moment.

20:14.369 --> 20:15.670
- Very.

20:15.670 --> 20:17.470
- You know what, just put in
a random two-digit number.

20:17.470 --> 20:18.900
- Okay.
- We're working our way down.

20:18.900 --> 20:21.099
Hit the Equals button.
We'll be done with this.

20:21.099 --> 20:22.930
Ooh, that's a--
okay, that's a big number, yes?

20:22.930 --> 20:24.500
- Yes.
- Okay.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.829
I'm not good with math,

20:26.829 --> 20:28.500
but just kind of proofread me.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.529
It looks like it's...

20:29.529 --> 20:34.769
577,345,663.

20:34.769 --> 20:35.869
- Correct.
- Does that seem right?

20:35.869 --> 20:36.869
- Yes.
- Okay.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.400
Would you hold the phone for me?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.900
That way I can see it.
Perfect.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.000
We're gonna write it down.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.200
Okay, so...

20:43.200 --> 20:54.029
577,345,663.

20:54.029 --> 20:55.470
All right, and you can
set the phone down.

20:55.470 --> 20:56.670
That's yours now.
- Okay.

20:56.670 --> 20:57.700
[laughter]

20:57.700 --> 20:59.000
Thanks, Penn.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.630
- It's an upgrade.
- Yeah, it is.

21:00.630 --> 21:02.369
- Here, if you'll hold that,
and if you'll stand over there

21:02.369 --> 21:03.829
so everybody can see
the glass right there?

21:03.829 --> 21:08.569
Now, the chances that my
prediction matches that number--

21:08.569 --> 21:10.470
the chances of it matching
are approximately

21:10.470 --> 21:14.299
1 in 577 million, 340--

21:14.299 --> 21:16.029
you get the idea.

21:16.029 --> 21:17.869
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:17.869 --> 21:19.500
my prediction...

21:23.569 --> 21:25.069
Is blank.
- Oh.

21:25.069 --> 21:26.599
- I said we were gonna
get weird.

21:26.599 --> 21:28.029
This is only part
of the prediction.

21:28.029 --> 21:30.829
We only need part of the napkin,

21:30.829 --> 21:32.930
and if you watch
the napkin closely,

21:32.930 --> 21:34.700
we'll get to the next part
of the prediction.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.099
Watch closely.

21:36.099 --> 21:38.799
Alyson, do you see
something happening?

21:38.799 --> 21:41.170
- Uh, yeah.
- Yes.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.099
What has happened?

21:43.099 --> 21:45.230
What does that appear to be?

21:45.230 --> 21:47.230
- [stammering]
An egg?

21:47.230 --> 21:49.029
- An egg.
It does look like an egg.

21:49.029 --> 21:50.529
But this is part
of my prediction,

21:50.529 --> 21:51.769
but it's not all
of the prediction.

21:51.769 --> 21:53.099
We only need part of it.

21:53.099 --> 21:56.369
We don't need this part
of the egg.

21:56.369 --> 21:57.369
Thank you.

21:57.369 --> 21:58.369
All we need...

21:58.369 --> 22:01.430
[applause]

22:02.730 --> 22:05.099
All we need is this.

22:05.099 --> 22:08.430
This is my prediction.
- Okay.

22:08.430 --> 22:09.829
- You don't get it.
- Not quite.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.700
- I said we were gonna
turn things inside out,

22:11.700 --> 22:13.730
upside down,
turn them all around,

22:13.730 --> 22:16.269
and in this case,
I'll hold the eggshells.

22:16.269 --> 22:19.900
Alyson, would you please
turn the pad all the way around

22:19.900 --> 22:21.500
for everybody to see?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.930
- [stammering]
- All the way around.

22:22.930 --> 22:24.869
Rotate it around.
- Okay. Confused.

22:24.869 --> 22:27.000
- Alyson Hannigan,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.029
Eggshells.

22:29.029 --> 22:32.869
- Oh.

22:32.869 --> 22:35.569
I get it.

22:35.569 --> 22:36.700
[cheers and applause]

22:36.700 --> 22:39.329
Ben Young, everybody.

22:39.329 --> 22:41.130
- Thank you.

22:41.130 --> 22:42.529
Thank you.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.200
[applause]

22:44.200 --> 22:46.730
- Wow, that's so cool.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.829
So what got you into magic

22:48.829 --> 22:50.900
in the beginning of your--your--

22:50.900 --> 22:52.700
- I actually--
I asked myself, "Ben,"

22:52.700 --> 22:53.700
'cause that's my name--

22:53.700 --> 22:55.400
"Ben, what career choice

22:55.400 --> 22:57.430
would make my mom
the most disappointed in me?"

22:57.430 --> 23:00.329
- Aww.

23:00.329 --> 23:01.329
- We're well on our way.

23:01.329 --> 23:02.869
- Aww.
- Yeah.

23:02.869 --> 23:05.099
- So do you do sort of big acts

23:05.099 --> 23:07.630
like escapes or anything, like,

23:07.630 --> 23:09.630
on a large scale as well?
- I do.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.470
I like to have my personality

23:11.470 --> 23:12.970
be the driving force
in the magic,

23:12.970 --> 23:14.700
but I do a straitjacket escape
as well.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.529
That's one of the bigger
things that I do, yeah.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.529
- Wow.
- Yeah.

23:17.529 --> 23:18.829
- All right,
well, let's check in

23:18.829 --> 23:19.970
with Penn and Teller.

23:19.970 --> 23:21.130
- Let's see what they got.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.700
- I loved you--I love the idea

23:23.700 --> 23:25.200
of turning it sideways

23:25.200 --> 23:26.730
to take the selfie.
- Yes.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.730
- 'Cause the phone's--
you know, you never know.

23:28.730 --> 23:32.500
A lot of people do selfies
in portrait mode,

23:32.500 --> 23:35.029
and you doing it in landscape
was a really great--

23:35.029 --> 23:36.599
I like you doing that,
'cause that's the way

23:36.599 --> 23:37.900
movies are supposed to be.
- Yeah, sure.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.029
- They're supposed to be.

23:39.029 --> 23:41.930
And that turn was a--
was a lot of what

23:41.930 --> 23:43.170
made this whole thing great,

23:43.170 --> 23:44.599
and the eggshell--

23:44.599 --> 23:47.799
to use that as a punch line to
a number thing is really great,

23:47.799 --> 23:49.029
but now we're gonna do something

23:49.029 --> 23:50.769
very special for you, Ben.
- Okay.

23:50.769 --> 23:52.029
- 'Cause Teller writes stuff

23:52.029 --> 23:53.099
all the time.
- Okay.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.029
- And we never let
Alyson see it.

23:55.029 --> 23:56.900
We never let the audience
see it,

23:56.900 --> 23:58.670
but Teller's written down
something.

23:58.670 --> 24:02.569
He's gonna let everybody see
right here,

24:02.569 --> 24:04.970
and because you're so good
with codes...

24:04.970 --> 24:06.799
- Every--
- You may have a really

24:06.799 --> 24:09.569
nice idea what that means, Ben.

24:09.569 --> 24:12.230
Does that mean anything
to you, Ben, right there?

24:12.230 --> 24:14.299
- Yes, it does.
- But, see, it's really nice.

24:14.299 --> 24:16.170
If you show it around at home
and everything,

24:16.170 --> 24:18.569
right there is what we're
showing there.

24:18.569 --> 24:20.299
Does it have a little bit
of a hint that we might know?

24:20.299 --> 24:21.599
- A little bit, yes.
- A little bit, yeah.

24:21.599 --> 24:23.529
- So what does that mean to you?
- But beautifully done.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.599
Beautifully done,
beautifully done.

24:24.599 --> 24:26.069
- Yes, thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

24:26.069 --> 24:27.170
Thank you.
Thank you.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.029
- It looks like
you didn't fool them.

24:29.029 --> 24:30.029
- No.
- Is that correct?

24:30.029 --> 24:31.269
- Correct.
- Aww.

24:31.269 --> 24:33.400
Well, thank you so much.
- Yeah, thank you, Alyson.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.700
Appreciate it.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

24:34.700 --> 24:36.569
Ben Young!
- Thank you so much.

24:36.569 --> 24:38.099
- Thank you.

24:38.099 --> 24:40.069
[cheers and applause]

24:40.069 --> 24:42.599
Much more to come,
including an amazing trick

24:42.599 --> 24:43.769
by Penn and Teller,

24:43.769 --> 24:45.769
so stick around.

24:45.769 --> 24:48.769
[jazz music]

24:48.769 --> 24:50.130
â™ª â™ª

24:54.400 --> 24:56.869
[jazz music]

24:56.869 --> 24:59.200
[cheers and applause]

24:59.200 --> 25:00.430
- You came back.

25:00.430 --> 25:01.869
I knew you would.

25:01.869 --> 25:05.230
As a reward, here's our next
potential fooler.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.000
- One of the hardest things
I've found is,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.329
how do you
make magic interesting

25:11.329 --> 25:12.970
and relevant?

25:12.970 --> 25:15.599
What I'm trying to do
is present magical routines

25:15.599 --> 25:18.430
that are about me
and the way I see the world.

25:18.430 --> 25:21.069
We are pretty preoccupied
with race.

25:21.069 --> 25:23.269
I've gotten it my whole life,
ever since I was a young boy.

25:23.269 --> 25:25.099
People are wondering,
"Where is this guy from?

25:25.099 --> 25:26.799
Is he this, is he that?"

25:26.799 --> 25:29.829
He's got different-looking
features.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.900
As I got older
and got better at magic,

25:31.900 --> 25:33.930
I incorporated all of it

25:33.930 --> 25:35.799
into a magic routine,

25:35.799 --> 25:37.329
because magic teaches you

25:37.329 --> 25:39.130
that all you think you know

25:39.130 --> 25:40.329
might not all hold true,

25:40.329 --> 25:42.930
and don't judge a book
by its cover.

25:42.930 --> 25:45.369
What I hope to teach
a person watching my show

25:45.369 --> 25:47.130
is that important things

25:47.130 --> 25:49.599
can also be entertaining.

25:49.599 --> 25:53.430
[cheers and applause]

25:53.430 --> 25:56.200
- Please welcome Henok!

25:56.200 --> 25:59.200
[cheers and applause]

26:04.000 --> 26:05.500
- Ta-da.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.829
[laughter]

26:06.829 --> 26:08.000
Folks, I know
it doesn't look like much,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.900
but that envelope is a mystery,

26:09.900 --> 26:11.369
because inside of that envelope

26:11.369 --> 26:13.730
lies the answer to the question
you've been asking yourself

26:13.730 --> 26:15.799
since the moment
I've taken the stage,

26:15.799 --> 26:17.569
that question being

26:17.569 --> 26:23.200
"Who is this mysterious
caramel man?"

26:23.200 --> 26:25.099
[laughter]

26:25.099 --> 26:29.230
"And what is his exotic
mixed background?"

26:29.230 --> 26:31.170
Thousands have tried,
but thousands have failed

26:31.170 --> 26:32.869
to guess my exotic
mixed background,

26:32.869 --> 26:34.430
so tonight,
for your viewing pleasure,

26:34.430 --> 26:35.900
and especially
for my own curiosity,

26:35.900 --> 26:37.569
we're gonna play a game.

26:37.569 --> 26:38.670
A game I like to call

26:38.670 --> 26:42.529
Please, Guess My Exotic
Mixed Background.

26:42.529 --> 26:43.970
[laughter]

26:43.970 --> 26:44.970
The game is simple.

26:44.970 --> 26:45.970
All you have to do is just guess

26:45.970 --> 26:47.369
which two countries I come from.

26:47.369 --> 26:48.569
No right or wrong answer here,

26:48.569 --> 26:50.170
just your opinion.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.599
Penn, we'll begin with you.

26:51.599 --> 26:53.500
You're a man
that's traveled the world.

26:53.500 --> 26:57.529
Whenever you're ready,
give me any two countries.

26:57.529 --> 26:59.630
- Haiti.

26:59.630 --> 27:01.730
Dominican Republic.

27:01.730 --> 27:03.299
- And just like that,
we are building

27:03.299 --> 27:06.430
an exotic powerhouse of a man

27:06.430 --> 27:08.430
and a heck of a baseball player.

27:08.430 --> 27:10.599
[laughter]

27:10.599 --> 27:12.630
Teller, we'll go with you.
I know you're a quiet man,

27:12.630 --> 27:14.170
but you--you hang around
with Penn,

27:14.170 --> 27:15.470
so you tend to travel as well.

27:15.470 --> 27:16.930
Think of the two--
any two countries,

27:16.930 --> 27:18.170
and whisper 'em to your friend.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.329
- He says France
and the Philippines.

27:21.329 --> 27:24.000
- France and the Philippines.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.069
Folks, it does not get
any more exotic than that.

27:29.470 --> 27:31.700
I'll tell you what.

27:31.700 --> 27:32.769
Got a gentleman right there

27:32.769 --> 27:34.369
in the blue shirt
a few rows back.

27:34.369 --> 27:35.369
Sir, what's your name?

27:35.369 --> 27:36.500
- Andrew.
- Andrew.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.069
Andrew, you and I
have never met before.

27:38.069 --> 27:39.069
- No.

27:39.069 --> 27:40.599
- But as you can imagine,
Andrew,

27:40.599 --> 27:42.200
being a Haitian, Dominican,

27:42.200 --> 27:44.200
French, Filipino guy...

27:44.200 --> 27:45.869
- [laughing]

27:45.869 --> 27:48.400
- I used to have a nickname
in college.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.170
Andrew, it was
a simple nickname.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.670
Very simple.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.829
What do you think it was?

27:54.829 --> 27:56.269
- The Legend.

27:56.269 --> 27:59.099
- The Legend?

27:59.099 --> 28:01.099
Alyson, I want you
to imagine, Alyson,

28:01.099 --> 28:02.569
that you get the opportunity
to go out

28:02.569 --> 28:04.799
for a night on the town
here in Las Vegas

28:04.799 --> 28:08.269
with a Haitian, Dominican,
French, Filipino guy

28:08.269 --> 28:09.400
named the Legend.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.029
- [laughs]

28:11.029 --> 28:12.569
- It's a heck of a story
for your friends

28:12.569 --> 28:14.200
and family, Alyson.
- Mm-hmm.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.000
- What's the name of the
restaurant we're going to go to?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.599
Lady's choice,
no expense spared.

28:17.599 --> 28:18.599
- Ooh.

28:18.599 --> 28:19.900
Is there a Nobu?

28:19.900 --> 28:20.900
- Yes, there is.

28:20.900 --> 28:21.900
- Nobu!

28:21.900 --> 28:22.900
- Nobu.

28:22.900 --> 28:23.900
As you can tell,

28:23.900 --> 28:27.130
Alyson has very,
very high taste.

28:27.130 --> 28:29.630
Folks, we've learned a lot
by doing this.

28:29.630 --> 28:32.269
We've learned that our judges
are very strange individuals

28:32.269 --> 28:34.970
with highly unusual
opinions about me.

28:34.970 --> 28:37.569
We also learned you can't
judge a book by its cover,

28:37.569 --> 28:39.769
'cause at the end of the day,
I'm not Haitian, Dominican,

28:39.769 --> 28:41.430
French, or from the Philippines.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.000
None of the above.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.430
The truth is,

28:44.430 --> 28:46.500
I happen to have
an Ethiopian father

28:46.500 --> 28:47.930
and an Irish mother.

28:47.930 --> 28:50.329
Ethiopian-Irish not only
produced these strange features,

28:50.329 --> 28:52.000
but it serves as a warning,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.130
because if any of you try
to challenge me to a contest

28:54.130 --> 28:55.730
that involves
long-distance running

28:55.730 --> 28:56.730
and drinking...

28:56.730 --> 28:59.400
- [laughing]

28:59.400 --> 29:01.299
- You're going to lose, Alyson,

29:01.299 --> 29:02.500
'cause I was bred
for that sport.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.829
- Okay.
- However, tonight, you guys

29:03.829 --> 29:05.000
came out here
not to know how far

29:05.000 --> 29:06.930
a man can run
or how much he can drink.

29:06.930 --> 29:08.930
You came here for a mystery.

29:13.230 --> 29:14.869
Inside that envelope
is a piece of paper

29:14.869 --> 29:16.130
with words on it.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.299
Powerful, powerful words.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.630
Alyson, are you busy right now?
- No.

29:20.630 --> 29:22.130
- Tell you what, give Alyson
a big round of applause

29:22.130 --> 29:23.500
as she comes up and joins me
up here onstage.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.329
Give it up for Alyson.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.400
[speaking indistinctly]

29:27.400 --> 29:28.900
If you will, we need to
open up the mystery.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.000
Take off the clasps for me.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Excellent.
Get rid of it.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.029
We don't need it anymore.

29:33.029 --> 29:34.130
[clasp clatters on floor]

29:34.130 --> 29:36.029
[laughter]

29:36.029 --> 29:37.569
Alyson,
you've unsealed the mystery.

29:37.569 --> 29:39.470
If you would, take out
that piece of paper for me.

29:39.470 --> 29:40.829
Unfold it all the way.

29:40.829 --> 29:42.500
Folks, the reason I keep
one piece of paper

29:42.500 --> 29:44.569
inside of an envelope
is because that is an entry

29:44.569 --> 29:46.130
from my diary,

29:46.130 --> 29:47.500
AKA man journal,

29:47.500 --> 29:48.900
and before a show,
I like to confess

29:48.900 --> 29:50.369
some heavy things on paper.

29:50.369 --> 29:52.269
Alyson, if you would,
take it right from the top.

29:52.269 --> 29:54.269
Read it loudly and slowly,

29:54.269 --> 29:55.869
so we can process
this whole thing.

29:55.869 --> 29:57.599
- "Dear man journal..."
- Mm-hmm.

29:57.599 --> 29:58.829
- That's cute.

29:58.829 --> 30:01.329
"I'm really looking forward
to performing

30:01.329 --> 30:03.730
"on 'Penn & Teller: Fool Us'
tomorrow.

30:03.730 --> 30:06.700
"I am also interested
in the judges' thoughts

30:06.700 --> 30:09.230
"on my exotic mixed background.

30:09.230 --> 30:13.000
"My guess is that the talkative
judge will say

30:13.000 --> 30:14.829
'Haiti, Dominican.'"

30:14.829 --> 30:16.069
- Wait, Penn, that was you.

30:16.069 --> 30:17.299
- That was me.
I'm the talkative judge.

30:17.299 --> 30:18.869
- Yep.
- I said that.

30:18.869 --> 30:22.970
- "And the quiet one will think
'France, Philippines.'"

30:22.970 --> 30:23.970
- That was you.
- Yep.

30:23.970 --> 30:25.329
- "After the performance,

30:25.329 --> 30:29.029
Alyson and I will go
to a special restaurant, Nobu."

30:29.029 --> 30:31.430
- It's meant to be.
- "I hope the viewers

30:31.430 --> 30:32.869
"enjoy this mystery.

30:32.869 --> 30:35.029
Love always,
the Legend."

30:35.029 --> 30:37.200
- The Legend, folks.
The Legend.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.470
[applause]

30:38.470 --> 30:39.470
The Legend.

30:39.470 --> 30:42.470
[applause]

30:43.730 --> 30:45.930
- Are we really going to Nobu?

30:45.930 --> 30:47.170
- Yeah, we're definitely going.

30:47.170 --> 30:48.529
- Awesome.
- We're--it's--

30:48.529 --> 30:50.500
- I'm so glad I didn't--
- We shouldn't wait

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
for them to deliberate.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.930
We should just go right now.
- Okay.

30:52.930 --> 30:54.769
I'm so glad
I didn't pick Chipotle.

30:54.769 --> 30:56.069
- This is for you to keep...
- Aw, thank you.

30:56.069 --> 30:57.400
- To always remember
the mystery, all right?

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
- Yeah.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.500
That is so cool.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.630
- Thank you.
Thank you.

31:00.630 --> 31:03.670
- So do you incorporate
personal stories

31:03.670 --> 31:05.230
into all of your tricks?

31:05.230 --> 31:08.430
- Yeah, I try to
keep everything about me

31:08.430 --> 31:10.400
and things that
I've experienced in life,

31:10.400 --> 31:12.099
life experiences,
to try to make it

31:12.099 --> 31:14.000
as authentic as possible,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.329
so when people maybe see
a magic routine,

31:16.329 --> 31:18.369
they're getting to learn
just a little bit about me.

31:18.369 --> 31:20.869
- And so what else would you
like the audience to know

31:20.869 --> 31:24.500
about you that they can't tell
just by looking at you?

31:24.500 --> 31:26.730
- I like long walks
on the beach.

31:26.730 --> 31:28.269
- Aww.

31:28.269 --> 31:29.569
Very sweet.

31:29.569 --> 31:31.470
Let's go to Penn and Teller.

31:31.470 --> 31:33.599
Penn, Teller,

31:33.599 --> 31:35.069
what do you think?

31:35.069 --> 31:38.630
- Well, another act
that we just loved.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.130
What you've taken
is a 21st-century premise,

31:42.130 --> 31:43.470
which is, as soon as you

31:43.470 --> 31:45.099
talk about race...
- Mm-hmm.

31:45.099 --> 31:46.869
- In the United States
of America

31:46.869 --> 31:48.329
in the 21st century--

31:48.329 --> 31:51.069
as soon as you talk
about where people are from,

31:51.069 --> 31:53.329
no matter what side
you are of that,

31:53.329 --> 31:55.200
no matter how you feel
about that,

31:55.200 --> 31:56.799
everything tightens up...
- Mm-hmm.

31:56.799 --> 31:58.630
- In your body, so when you

31:58.630 --> 32:00.099
brought that up--

32:00.099 --> 32:02.829
brought up the actual question
we were thinking about...

32:02.829 --> 32:04.799
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is what you look like,

32:04.799 --> 32:07.269
where you're from,
what your ancestry is,

32:07.269 --> 32:11.930
it brings a feeling
that is real and contemporary

32:11.930 --> 32:14.829
and gives that little
off-kilter feeling.

32:14.829 --> 32:18.269
I can't tell you how smart
I think that is...

32:18.269 --> 32:19.369
- Oh, thank you.

32:19.369 --> 32:24.130
- To replace the spiritual
mumbo jumbo

32:24.130 --> 32:26.230
with something
really contemporary

32:26.230 --> 32:28.299
and powerful,
and it was an amazing way

32:28.299 --> 32:30.000
to do confabulation.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.099
Amazing way to do that trick,

32:32.099 --> 32:35.569
because I have never
cared or worried

32:35.569 --> 32:37.430
about what a prediction
was gonna be,

32:37.430 --> 32:39.900
and I cared and worried
about this,

32:39.900 --> 32:41.829
and it was perfectly executed.

32:41.829 --> 32:42.829
- Thank you.

32:42.829 --> 32:44.730
- Well, that was

32:44.730 --> 32:46.829
a lot of praise.
- Mm-hmm.

32:46.829 --> 32:50.799
- Was there also
some sort of code word in there?

32:50.799 --> 32:52.099
- Well--
- All I heard was compliments.

32:52.099 --> 32:53.230
- Unfortunately,
I didn't fool 'em.

32:53.230 --> 32:54.230
- Aww.
- They're--they know

32:54.230 --> 32:55.230
what they're talking about.

32:55.230 --> 32:56.230
- And I got to tell you,

32:56.230 --> 32:58.029
I wish more than anything

32:58.029 --> 33:00.099
that I had nailed
Ethiopian and Irish,

33:00.099 --> 33:01.700
'cause then
you would've gone crazy.

33:01.700 --> 33:03.730
- Nobody's ever gotten it
so far, but...

33:03.730 --> 33:04.900
- [laughing]
- Aww.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.569
Well, thank you, Henok.
- Thank you.

33:07.569 --> 33:08.869
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

33:08.869 --> 33:11.299
Ladies and gentlemen, Henok.

33:11.299 --> 33:12.670
[applause]

33:12.670 --> 33:14.000
All right, Penn and Teller

33:14.000 --> 33:15.900
have been sitting around
all night,

33:15.900 --> 33:18.269
but we'll get them up
and put them to work

33:18.269 --> 33:19.269
when we come back.

33:19.269 --> 33:20.970
You don't want to miss it.

33:20.970 --> 33:26.630
â™ª â™ª

33:30.930 --> 33:33.369
[jazz music]

33:33.369 --> 33:36.099
[cheers and applause]

33:36.099 --> 33:38.029
- And now, to close the show,

33:38.029 --> 33:40.400
the king of our stacked deck,

33:40.400 --> 33:42.230
Penn and Teller.

33:42.230 --> 33:45.230
[cheers and applause]

33:47.829 --> 33:49.130
- We get asked pretty often

33:49.130 --> 33:50.630
how'd we get into magic,

33:50.630 --> 33:52.069
how'd we get into theater,

33:52.069 --> 33:54.700
and I don't ever really answer.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.200
They don't want me
to really answer.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.930
They want to hear about Houdini

33:58.930 --> 34:01.029
and swindling and trickery

34:01.029 --> 34:03.369
and honest lying,

34:03.369 --> 34:06.269
but the truth is more complex.

34:06.269 --> 34:08.829
How I got here
is not very linear.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.730
I spent summers in the woods,
camping with my parents.

34:11.730 --> 34:14.170
I walked in the woods alone.

34:14.170 --> 34:15.730
I explored,

34:15.730 --> 34:18.099
and that's where
I discovered the prop

34:18.099 --> 34:21.099
that would make me
who I wanted to be.

34:21.099 --> 34:24.869
The prop that put me
in this show.

34:24.869 --> 34:25.900
It was a beaver trap,

34:25.900 --> 34:27.829
and I knew it was
very dangerous.

34:27.829 --> 34:29.829
I knew it belonged
to someone else,

34:29.829 --> 34:31.099
but I picked it up

34:31.099 --> 34:34.030
carefully, so as not to crush
my fingers.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.469
I brought the trap
back to my parents.

34:36.469 --> 34:38.300
My parents had taught me
not to steal.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.699
My parents raised me well,

34:40.699 --> 34:44.099
but my parents hated trappers.

34:44.099 --> 34:45.670
They hated that image of a trap

34:45.670 --> 34:49.230
designed to not quite
break the bone,

34:49.230 --> 34:51.829
so the tortured,
panicked animal

34:51.829 --> 34:56.130
would not be able to chew
its own leg off too swiftly.

34:56.130 --> 34:58.630
So to my parents,
I was not a thief.

34:58.630 --> 35:02.130
To my parents,
I was some sort of hero.

35:02.130 --> 35:05.829
In their minds,
I'd saved an innocent animal

35:05.829 --> 35:07.730
from a horrible death,

35:07.730 --> 35:10.369
so I could keep the trap

35:10.369 --> 35:14.500
as a reminder of the cruelty
of some of my species

35:14.500 --> 35:18.969
and a promise that I would
grow up different.

35:18.969 --> 35:21.269
I didn't care about any of that.

35:21.269 --> 35:23.570
I just wanted the trap,

35:23.570 --> 35:26.000
and now it was mine.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.429
[metallic snapping]

35:28.429 --> 35:30.130
When summer was over,

35:30.130 --> 35:32.699
I brought the trap
back to our home.

35:32.699 --> 35:35.500
I kept it in my room.
I oiled it.

35:35.500 --> 35:39.699
I decided that I would
become an expert.

35:39.699 --> 35:41.570
I got my first job.

35:41.570 --> 35:45.400
I was route supervisor
for a small giveaway newspaper.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.099
I did spot-checks
going door-to-door,

35:48.099 --> 35:50.130
making sure the other paperboys

35:50.130 --> 35:53.269
had done their jobs properly,

35:53.269 --> 35:57.099
and I bought traps.

35:57.099 --> 35:59.030
[dramatic country music]

35:59.030 --> 36:01.099
[crowd murmuring]

36:01.099 --> 36:03.769
I bought mouse and rat.

36:03.769 --> 36:08.230
I bought prairie dog and weasel.

36:08.230 --> 36:12.469
My second job
was filling gum-ball machines.

36:12.469 --> 36:16.500
I bought otter and wildcat.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.099
I learned everything
about the traps.

36:19.099 --> 36:21.730
I learned how some traps
are set in the water,

36:21.730 --> 36:23.929
so the animal will drown.

36:23.929 --> 36:26.670
I learned how every trap
is marked with a number

36:26.670 --> 36:29.730
that indicates
the strength of the jaws.

36:29.730 --> 36:32.500
I learned how the chain
coming off the trap

36:32.500 --> 36:34.329
is not hooked to a tree

36:34.329 --> 36:38.130
but rather to a loose log
called a drag...

36:38.130 --> 36:39.670
â™ª â™ª

36:39.670 --> 36:42.269
Which confuses and tires
the animal without giving it--

36:42.269 --> 36:43.400
[metallic snapping]

36:43.400 --> 36:45.269
- Oh!

36:45.269 --> 36:47.329
- Without giving it
the necessary leverage

36:47.329 --> 36:48.670
for escape.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.500
I kept my respect,

36:51.500 --> 36:53.570
but I conquered my fear.

36:53.570 --> 36:54.769
â™ª â™ª

36:54.769 --> 36:57.230
After I'd read every book
on the subject

36:57.230 --> 36:58.929
in my local library,

36:58.929 --> 37:01.429
I sent away for books
and catalogs

37:01.429 --> 37:04.400
from the back
of "Field & Stream" magazine.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.170
Whenever a book
arrived in the mail,

37:07.170 --> 37:10.869
as soon as I'd open it,
I'd write in the front.

37:10.869 --> 37:14.030
I'd write the date,
how much I paid,

37:14.030 --> 37:17.170
the address to which I'd sent,

37:17.170 --> 37:19.099
and then I'd write my name.

37:19.099 --> 37:21.570
And after my name,
I'd put a comma,

37:21.570 --> 37:24.570
and after the comma,
in quotation marks,

37:24.570 --> 37:26.000
I'd write,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.400
"King of Animal Traps."

[cheers and applause]

39:26.269 --> 39:29.199
[laughter]

39:29.199 --> 39:31.570
- When I got a little older,
I got a job

39:31.570 --> 39:34.329
washing dishes
for a whole summer,

39:34.329 --> 39:37.329
and I bought bear.

39:37.329 --> 39:38.929
[chain clattering]

39:38.929 --> 39:40.130
Finally, I had a bear trap.

39:40.130 --> 39:42.829
It was really big,
a little rusty.

39:42.829 --> 39:44.170
It was used,
an antique,

39:44.170 --> 39:46.369
a piece of Americana.

39:46.369 --> 39:49.369
The jaws of this trap
were so big,

39:49.369 --> 39:53.570
it would ruin the pelt
of anything smaller than a bear.

39:53.570 --> 39:56.130
To set this trap,
I needed a tool.

39:56.130 --> 39:59.469
It was too strong to set
by standing on it.

39:59.469 --> 40:02.570
The mechanism
was too powerful to be moved

40:02.570 --> 40:04.969
by full body weight.
I needed a tool.

40:04.969 --> 40:05.969
[metallic snapping]

40:05.969 --> 40:07.869
[crowd murmuring]

40:07.869 --> 40:10.630
I needed a tool
to hold down the spring.

40:10.630 --> 40:13.869
A tool to pry open the jaws.

40:13.869 --> 40:19.369
A tool to put leverage
back on my side,

40:19.369 --> 40:21.530
and I mastered it.

40:21.530 --> 40:24.000
I was not an animal.
I was human,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.630
and I had two thumbs,
and I had sense in my head,

40:27.630 --> 40:30.630
and I could set the trap
without being hurt.

40:30.630 --> 40:34.500
â™ª â™ª

40:34.500 --> 40:38.070
And I could get bait
out of the trap

40:38.070 --> 40:41.869
without being injured.

40:41.869 --> 40:43.599
I was...

40:43.599 --> 40:44.599
[drumroll]

40:44.599 --> 40:47.570
King of Animal Traps.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.570
[drumroll]

40:52.630 --> 40:55.630
[cheers and applause]

41:06.030 --> 41:08.429
I showed my classmates my skill.

41:08.429 --> 41:10.230
They were impressed

41:10.230 --> 41:11.500
but not impressed enough

41:11.500 --> 41:15.130
that I felt I could make it
my whole career,

41:15.130 --> 41:17.230
so I broadened my horizons,

41:17.230 --> 41:20.030
and I diluted my goals.

41:20.030 --> 41:23.769
And that's how I got to be half
of Penn and Teller.

41:23.769 --> 41:24.769
Here you go, Teller.

41:24.769 --> 41:25.769
[shouts]

41:25.769 --> 41:28.130
[crowd exclaiming]

41:28.130 --> 41:31.130
[cheers and applause]

41:37.469 --> 41:39.099
- Okay.

41:39.099 --> 41:40.699
All right.

41:40.699 --> 41:41.869
I got to go lie down

41:41.869 --> 41:43.630
after seeing that.

41:43.630 --> 41:44.929
Come back for more

41:44.929 --> 41:48.400
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us"
next week.
