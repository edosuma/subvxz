WEBVTT

00:03.513 --> 00:04.712
It's my responsibility.

00:04.713 --> 00:08.032
No. It's my responsibility.
I created her.

00:09.833 --> 00:13.593
But it's a match for
Bill Martin's blood type.

00:14.633 --> 00:16.032
Do you think that's the murder weapon?

00:16.033 --> 00:16.913
It could be.

00:16.914 --> 00:20.192
Why would this woman want
to frame Isabella?

00:20.193 --> 00:21.912
Shall we have dinner?

00:21.913 --> 00:24.192
There's one or two errands
I need to run though.

00:24.193 --> 00:26.993
- Winter. He just released Isabella.
- What?!

00:31.273 --> 00:33.513
I know you're here!

00:40.873 --> 00:48.873
Come on Harry. Come on.
My God! My God!

00:49.953 --> 00:52.073
- NO!
- No, he's dead.

01:39.033 --> 01:43.152
Don't scream... Don't scream!

01:43.153 --> 01:45.512
Just give me what you've got
and I leave you alive.

01:45.513 --> 01:47.633
I've got nothing.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.152
What's this?!

01:54.153 --> 01:55.153
Leave me alone.

01:55.273 --> 01:58.553
Hand it over... now.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.469
Do you want it?

02:05.633 --> 02:07.015
It's yours.

02:38.633 --> 02:41.233
- Harry! Harry!
- Shocking. Clear.

02:46.793 --> 02:47.992
Can you hear me, Harry?

02:47.993 --> 02:50.312
- Harry!
- We need to get him to the hospital.

02:50.313 --> 02:51.832
Harry, stay with us, alright?

02:51.833 --> 02:54.633
It's alright. It's alright, Harry.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.593
Harry.

02:59.473 --> 03:00.992
Hey, it's me.

03:00.993 --> 03:05.953
Erm, you're thirty minutes late
I just hope you're alright?

03:08.873 --> 03:10.792
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:10.793 --> 03:11.852
I'm sorry.

03:11.877 --> 03:13.592
I thought maybe something
might've happened.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.592
No, it's the Dalston Soup Kitchen.

03:15.593 --> 03:17.592
It's a... a madhouse.

03:17.593 --> 03:19.752
It's fine. I'm just glad you're alright.

03:19.753 --> 03:24.433
Hum! What have you been doing?
Cooking? It smells great.

03:25.673 --> 03:29.272
I just wanted to say sorry
for what happened.

03:29.273 --> 03:30.312
I could tell...

03:30.313 --> 03:33.032
You know, I should never have
allowed your arrest.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.912
It's alright.

03:34.913 --> 03:41.593
You mean a lot to me and err,
I just hope you can forgive me.

03:45.553 --> 03:48.553
It's work, I'm sorry.

03:49.864 --> 03:51.160
Yeah.

03:55.393 --> 03:57.228
God... Where is he?

04:00.658 --> 04:03.113
Alright! Well I, I, I'll be right there.

04:06.673 --> 04:10.372
It's one of my officers, Harry
Clayton. He's had a serious accident.

04:11.066 --> 04:14.146
- I'm sorry I gotta go.
- Yeah go. Go.

04:23.266 --> 04:26.306
No Jay, Jay, Jay... I got something.

04:32.426 --> 04:33.866
Ready?

04:37.026 --> 04:38.467
Nathan, it's not moving!

04:38.492 --> 04:40.250
I'm trying!

04:54.706 --> 04:59.985
SHIT!!! So now, I can't even pawn it.

04:59.986 --> 05:04.665
And I've gotta get publicly
beaten wearing... jewellery!

05:04.666 --> 05:06.745
- Well, I'll fight instead.
- What?

05:06.746 --> 05:09.225
C'mon, I go in, I take a few
punches, we get the money,

05:09.226 --> 05:10.886
- pay the debt.
- No.

05:11.346 --> 05:12.905
Jay, you nearly died last time.

05:12.906 --> 05:15.266
And you think I'm gonna let my
little brother risk it?

05:21.066 --> 05:24.593
We both know mum would've beaten me
to a pulp for not looking after you.

05:25.106 --> 05:26.474
Alright?

05:28.186 --> 05:32.106
Besides, who knows? Odds might go
in my favour for a change.

05:32.705 --> 05:36.666
What, like, you might go down in the
second round, instead of the first!

05:42.426 --> 05:46.705
Think he's waking up. Suri,
go and get Anna. Harry?

05:46.706 --> 05:49.906
Harry, can you hear me?

05:50.746 --> 05:54.103
If this is heaven, it's not what
it's cracked up to be!

05:56.266 --> 05:58.826
It's okay everyone, he's still an arse.

06:02.546 --> 06:04.705
I thought you were dead, you scumbag.

06:04.706 --> 06:06.626
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- Dad!

06:06.986 --> 06:08.380
Daisy...

06:09.506 --> 06:11.386
Dad, I was so worried about you!

06:13.383 --> 06:14.509
Hello.

06:14.826 --> 06:18.189
Daise, shall we go get something to eat?

06:20.106 --> 06:21.945
Get you something too if you like.

06:21.946 --> 06:25.546
Great, the third date vending machine.

06:36.906 --> 06:41.065
Err, I was so afraid the paramedics
wouldn't get there in time.

06:41.066 --> 06:42.426
You saved my life.

06:43.386 --> 06:45.332
You need saving.

06:54.986 --> 06:59.906
- It's gone!
- It's gone!

07:12.866 --> 07:14.185
Sorry...

07:14.186 --> 07:16.345
No, don't worry, Alistair,
come in. Come in.

07:16.346 --> 07:18.706
I'll go and find Daisy.

07:27.506 --> 07:29.785
God! I'm glad you're still
alive. I really thought...

07:29.786 --> 07:32.665
Alistair... What happened
wasn't an accident.

07:32.666 --> 07:34.831
Isabella tried to kill me.

07:37.186 --> 07:38.545
What are you talking about?

07:38.546 --> 07:41.506
I know it's the last thing
you want to believe.

07:41.666 --> 07:45.425
But last night she came to
shut me down for good.

07:45.426 --> 07:47.345
If Anna hadn't been there,
she'd've done the job.

07:47.346 --> 07:52.321
Harry, Harry, you've been through an
ordeal. Your head's in a mess...

07:52.346 --> 07:59.282
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
I'm crystal clear.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.265
They've been others too.

08:01.266 --> 08:04.185
The criminals on our list;
She's the one taking them out.

08:04.186 --> 08:05.745
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:05.746 --> 08:09.225
First you arrest my girlfriend with
deficient evidence, and now this!

08:09.226 --> 08:10.346
We were involved!

08:13.426 --> 08:14.493
What are you saying?

08:14.518 --> 08:20.385
Isabella and I knew each other
long before you did.

08:20.386 --> 08:22.705
When I broke it off,
she turned psychotic.

08:22.706 --> 08:24.977
That's why she's targeted you.

08:26.386 --> 08:27.705
No, you, you're lying.

08:27.706 --> 08:31.145
Look at me! Look! Look where I am.

08:31.146 --> 08:35.184
I maybe a lot of things, but I'm not
that cruel and I am not insane.

08:35.186 --> 08:37.784
So why else would I tell you this?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.544
Please, Alistair, please...

08:39.546 --> 08:41.345
Get yourself... Back on your feet.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.986
Listen Al, Alistair! Stay away from her!

08:46.881 --> 08:48.254
Shit.

09:01.026 --> 09:03.506
You're... still here.

09:03.826 --> 09:06.946
Yes, I thought I'd wait for
you after that call.

09:07.758 --> 09:09.666
Thought it might be a
rough night for you.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.836
Thanks.

09:31.146 --> 09:32.866
Do you wanna talk about it?

09:35.746 --> 09:39.046
Harry Clayton was
electrocuted last night.

09:40.986 --> 09:43.425
That is terrible..

09:43.426 --> 09:45.146
What a terrible way to die.

09:45.546 --> 09:47.945
How did that happen?

09:47.946 --> 09:52.478
I mean, was it in the line of duty?
Or an accident?

09:52.866 --> 09:55.306
We're looking into it.

09:58.266 --> 10:00.426
God. I'm sorry.

10:55.266 --> 11:02.425
You know, when you say 'weapon',
people think of a knife or a gun.

11:02.426 --> 11:04.185
But a glass shard can be just as lethal.

11:04.186 --> 11:05.305
Why are you here?

11:05.306 --> 11:07.106
I didn't want to kill Harry.

11:07.946 --> 11:10.426
But he made it impossible for me not to.

11:13.946 --> 11:15.225
Where's the other bracelet?

11:15.226 --> 11:16.866
I destroyed it.

11:18.106 --> 11:19.123
You're lying.

11:19.148 --> 11:23.034
You're the one who told me
to destroy yours if you died.

11:25.746 --> 11:27.185
Why would you do that?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.546
Because look what it's done to you!

11:30.166 --> 11:33.865
You just murdered the best
man I ever knew.

11:33.866 --> 11:36.141
And you can kill me, Isabella,

11:36.712 --> 11:43.072
it won't change the fact you're
alone now. For good.

11:52.026 --> 11:59.426
Leave town. If I see you,
I will kill you.

12:35.466 --> 12:40.385
Harry... Harry...

12:40.386 --> 12:45.985
You're dead. You're dead.
You're dead. Isabella...

12:45.986 --> 12:50.306
She killed me. But I came back again.

12:52.746 --> 12:54.145
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

12:54.146 --> 12:58.426
Probably. You going somewhere?

12:58.586 --> 13:01.706
Isabella came by;
She told me to get out of town.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.745
She thinks you're dead...
Has she seen you?

13:06.746 --> 13:10.226
No, but it's only a matter of time.

13:16.266 --> 13:17.826
Where's the bracelet?

13:20.146 --> 13:23.306
Eve, where's the bracelet?

13:24.827 --> 13:27.106
I... did something stupid.

13:59.026 --> 14:01.665
Come on, Jay... Come on
Jay, you got him.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.466
You got this.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.866
Finish him!

14:42.666 --> 14:50.666
And tonight, our winner,
Jay Tate! Jay Tate!

14:58.757 --> 15:01.362
But... What happened to
Harry was an accident.

15:01.877 --> 15:06.076
Investigating Harry's crash is
purely a precautionary measure.

15:06.077 --> 15:09.556
Just examine the site, liaise
with the Serious Collision.

15:09.557 --> 15:11.836
Investigation Squad, make sure
we're not missing anything.

15:11.837 --> 15:15.436
Okay, we'll visit the scene,
go to the impound.

15:15.437 --> 15:16.675
Thanks.

15:17.117 --> 15:21.076
And Suri? Please treat this with
the utmost confidentiality.

15:21.077 --> 15:23.751
Let's give Harry his recovery time.

15:24.317 --> 15:25.933
Sure.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.396
Can you get me a printout of all
the cases Harry Clayton

15:34.397 --> 15:38.036
investigated over the last three months.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.775
Thanks.

16:01.237 --> 16:04.316
According to the report, there was
a leak

16:04.317 --> 16:06.236
in Harry's brake fluid reservoir.

16:06.237 --> 16:07.556
In there, see that?

16:07.557 --> 16:10.885
Time of the accident, this
thing was pretty much empty.

16:11.621 --> 16:13.636
Could that have caused the crash?

16:13.637 --> 16:16.597
Hard to say. Would have
stopped him avoiding it.

16:19.277 --> 16:20.756
What caused the leak?

16:20.757 --> 16:23.636
It's natural abrasion, in
older vehicles.

16:23.637 --> 16:27.651
But the report says there's no way
of telling how or when it happened.

16:28.759 --> 16:30.836
But Harry just had that car serviced.

16:30.837 --> 16:32.784
Wouldn't they have spotted it?

16:37.717 --> 16:39.796
So that's it, it's all paid off?

16:39.797 --> 16:41.076
Yeah.

16:41.077 --> 16:44.556
Anything we make from here on out
goes straight to the bank of Jay.

16:44.557 --> 16:47.916
Lucky for you, the bank
covers its brother too.

16:47.917 --> 16:51.703
Tate? You there?

16:53.024 --> 16:54.784
You was on form last night.

16:55.467 --> 16:56.756
Been eating my greens, I guess.

16:56.757 --> 16:59.637
I've got another club tonight.
Big league.

17:00.046 --> 17:01.607
You feel like stepping up?

17:03.997 --> 17:06.095
- Yeah.
- Good lad.

17:10.156 --> 17:15.037
- Barman. Another.
- Uhuh?

17:18.676 --> 17:19.877
You celebrating?

17:21.810 --> 17:23.603
Or mourning...

17:25.156 --> 17:27.156
A little of both.

17:29.117 --> 17:32.237
I just lost my only companion.

17:33.037 --> 17:35.237
My last bit of hope in this world.

17:36.197 --> 17:38.892
Well, you know the best way
to get over someone?

17:39.827 --> 17:43.396
Get under someone-else.
You get me, ahahah.

17:43.397 --> 17:48.024
I'm having a very bad
day. Leave me alone.

17:59.157 --> 18:01.837
- Sorry about that.
- Thanks.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.019
That was rude.

18:29.717 --> 18:34.356
I thought I made
myself very clear.

18:34.357 --> 18:37.156
Yeah. I've had a real
fucker of an evening.

18:37.157 --> 18:41.636
So why don't you lose the resting
bitch face and make this fun for us.

18:41.637 --> 18:42.957
Yeah.

18:45.517 --> 18:46.877
Fine.

18:51.642 --> 18:54.076
Argh! My eyes.

18:54.077 --> 18:56.836
Argh! Argh! My eye's argh!

18:56.837 --> 18:58.877
Help me, please, somebody help!

18:59.477 --> 19:04.164
Dave, you got to come and see this kid,
dodges like he's a mind reader.

19:25.317 --> 19:27.276
You think our mugger's here?

19:27.277 --> 19:30.436
Regular fighters are marked with a
horseshoe tattoo on their thumb.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.236
He had one.

19:32.237 --> 19:35.836
Contestants get paid to enter
cause they might not come out.

19:35.837 --> 19:38.396
- Alright, Rory.
- Alright. Long time no see.

19:38.397 --> 19:39.157
Can we watch?

19:39.158 --> 19:41.836
Of course. Your mate looks
a little soft.

19:41.837 --> 19:44.237
Keep an eye on him.

19:48.957 --> 19:50.557
Tattoos.

19:55.597 --> 19:57.276
You know the guy in the green shorts?

19:57.277 --> 19:59.076
Yeah, Jay Tate.

19:59.077 --> 20:03.916
Usually on his back in minutes,
he's suddenly got cocky.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.237
Look at him, thinks he's Tyson Fury.

20:23.197 --> 20:30.317
Tonight's winner, Jay Tate! Jay
Tate! Jay Tate!

20:37.997 --> 20:39.157
Tate! Tate! Tate!

21:06.037 --> 21:09.396
- Sir?
- How'd it go?

21:09.397 --> 21:13.156
Crime scene was err, nasty, but
as the report suggested.

21:13.157 --> 21:17.838
Poor driving conditions, fallen
pylon cable, Harry was just

21:17.839 --> 21:20.116
unlucky to be the path of
least resistance.

21:20.117 --> 21:22.517
Nothing to suggest foul play there.

21:23.769 --> 21:25.516
- But?
- Well, there was one thing.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.956
Erm, a leak in the brake fluid
container of Harry's car.

21:28.957 --> 21:32.935
When he was out that night, he was
essentially driving without brakes.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.396
Do we know how it got there?

21:35.397 --> 21:38.196
No. But we know it's recent.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.076
Harry had the car serviced
two months ago.

21:40.077 --> 21:43.175
I checked the vehicle report,
there was no leak then.

21:43.597 --> 21:47.596
- Doesn't tell us much.
- No, it doesn't. But...

21:47.597 --> 21:50.716
Being there at the scene, adding up
all these weird factors...

21:50.717 --> 21:52.634
Something just doesn't feel right.

21:57.597 --> 21:59.546
Here are, just like I said.

22:00.174 --> 22:03.977
And there's plenty more where
that come from, alright?

22:06.757 --> 22:09.317
Bit more than an entrance fee, ain't it?

22:13.397 --> 22:16.321
- Tate. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:16.322 --> 22:19.315
Against all the odds? Some
serious brass balls on you.

22:19.316 --> 22:21.069
Or is it something else?

22:24.828 --> 22:25.887
Who are you?

22:25.888 --> 22:29.676
DI Clayton. I'm the last person to
wear what's on your wrist.

22:29.677 --> 22:31.276
You can feel it then.

22:31.277 --> 22:32.396
Piss off, mate.

22:32.397 --> 22:34.356
It's intoxicating, I get it.

22:34.357 --> 22:36.676
Everything is going your way,
feels invincible.

22:36.677 --> 22:37.956
But there are consequences.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.396
- What's he on about?
- Later...

22:39.397 --> 22:42.276
Listen to me. Every time
something lucky happens to you,

22:42.277 --> 22:44.276
something bad follows.

22:44.277 --> 22:45.458
Listen to me!

23:04.197 --> 23:05.437
Let's go! Let's go!

23:08.517 --> 23:09.917
Stay down. Stay down!

23:13.957 --> 23:19.316
Five, five, five thous,
five thousand. Five thousand.

23:19.317 --> 23:22.436
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

23:22.437 --> 23:24.076
We are gonna be rolling in it, bruv.

23:24.077 --> 23:26.476
Seriously, I reckon I can
beat anyone now.

23:26.477 --> 23:29.716
Yeah. You don't reckon that
copper's gonna come after us?

23:29.717 --> 23:32.316
I reckon he won't be able to catch us.

23:32.317 --> 23:33.335
Oi, mate!

23:33.484 --> 23:34.724
What're you doing?

23:34.837 --> 23:36.676
He's a pretty boy, ain't he?

23:36.677 --> 23:37.916
I'm talking about the car, not you.

23:37.917 --> 23:38.717
Can I help you?

23:38.718 --> 23:40.476
Yeah. You can give me your keys.

23:40.477 --> 23:41.797
Jay, people can see!

23:41.917 --> 23:43.476
I'm just talking nice to the fella.

23:43.477 --> 23:44.636
You don't want to make trouble with me.

23:44.637 --> 23:47.191
No. I want you to hand over
the car without a fuss.

23:47.957 --> 23:50.437
Alright, I warned you...

23:51.637 --> 23:53.396
Jay! Jay, Jay!

23:53.397 --> 23:56.756
- Stop it! Somebody help!
- Jay, what are you doing man?

23:56.757 --> 23:58.716
Get off him!

23:58.717 --> 24:00.237
- Jay, man!
- Give me the key!

24:01.757 --> 24:03.317
What are you doing, man?

24:04.597 --> 24:07.237
Jay. Jay. What are you doing?

24:10.877 --> 24:12.357
Get in the car, Nathan.

24:20.957 --> 24:22.837
Who the hell did you just mug?

24:47.718 --> 24:49.397
Jesus!

24:49.398 --> 24:53.398
You didn't have to do it, you
didn't have to be there tonight.

24:55.353 --> 24:58.869
There's nothing tying us together
anymore, you can just walk away.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.637
I know how much you hated
wearing the bracelet.

25:02.638 --> 25:03.774
Really?

25:06.214 --> 25:08.324
You're a funny thing.

25:09.158 --> 25:13.032
Eve, that guy is carrying a curse he
doesn't even realise is on him.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.717
However much of a dickhead Jay is,

25:16.718 --> 25:19.118
the bracelet's our responsibility.

25:20.798 --> 25:22.038
Not yours, Harry.

25:23.477 --> 25:28.707
I've worn it. I've seen what
it can do to a man.

25:30.118 --> 25:32.438
It'll always be my responsibility.

25:40.478 --> 25:42.117
And you really don't know where he is?

25:42.118 --> 25:45.757
Anna, I am doing everything in my
power to keep him safe.

25:45.758 --> 25:48.558
But you know what Harry's like.

25:58.358 --> 25:59.358
Let's go back.

26:00.942 --> 26:04.437
So the car swerved off the road,
that's when Harry got out?

26:04.438 --> 26:06.877
Yes. It's when the cable
electrocuted him.

26:06.878 --> 26:11.718
Any other details? Anything
out of the ordinary?

26:13.577 --> 26:15.437
Shouldn't you be asking
Harry these questions?

26:15.438 --> 26:19.038
Anna, if there's something you
know, you have to tell me.

26:21.678 --> 26:24.528
Harry said you were dating
Isabella Augustine.

26:24.798 --> 26:25.997
Why do you bring that up?

26:25.998 --> 26:28.197
Because before I say
anything, I need to know

26:28.198 --> 26:29.968
where she fits in to all of this.

26:30.598 --> 26:31.840
With you.

26:34.798 --> 26:36.597
Yes, we've been involved.

26:36.598 --> 26:43.693
But... I'm currently assessing the
nature of our relationship.

26:47.598 --> 26:50.078
There was a car tailing us that night.

26:50.550 --> 26:54.037
Alright. Did you get a look at it?
License plate, model, anything?

26:54.038 --> 26:55.718
It was a black four by four.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.838
Who was it, Anna?

27:01.846 --> 27:05.133
Find out where Isabella was the
night of the accident.

27:05.998 --> 27:07.438
Be careful, Alistair.

27:20.038 --> 27:22.998
Why didn't you tell me you
knew Harry Clayton?

27:23.838 --> 27:24.918
What do you mean?

27:26.558 --> 27:30.197
Harry told me, just before the accident,

27:30.198 --> 27:33.838
said you knew each other from
Gamblers' Anonymous.

27:36.398 --> 27:39.957
Well, we're not supposed to disclose
any information about other

27:39.958 --> 27:41.677
members, under any circumstances.

27:41.678 --> 27:44.197
But there you go!

27:44.198 --> 27:47.557
Well, I didn't even know you
had a gambling problem.

27:47.558 --> 27:52.477
I don't. I did, but not anymore.

27:52.478 --> 27:55.214
Honestly, Alistair,
that is all in the past...

27:56.968 --> 28:01.157
Harry and I barely spoke.
We didn't really know each other.

28:01.158 --> 28:03.958
You could have said
something that night.

28:04.289 --> 28:07.797
Apart from the discretion code,
it didn't really feel like the

28:07.798 --> 28:09.757
appropriate moment to
talk about all this.

28:09.758 --> 28:13.093
When you just had that call
about the accident.

28:17.838 --> 28:22.094
Okay. Thanks.

28:28.638 --> 28:31.558
Actually... We're not so
sure it was an accident.

28:34.318 --> 28:38.365
A man who lives opposite saw
the whole thing.

28:39.198 --> 28:44.277
Spotted a vehicle pulling away,
soon after Harry was electrocuted.

28:44.278 --> 28:45.638
Struck us as a bit odd.

28:46.558 --> 28:51.677
You know, car crashed,
Harry on the floor.

28:51.678 --> 28:53.517
You'd have thought they'd
have at least stopped.

28:53.518 --> 28:56.638
Yes. That does sound odd.

28:57.145 --> 28:59.438
It's probably nothing,
but we're gonna bring him in,

29:00.309 --> 29:02.958
interview him for a vehicle description.

29:04.949 --> 29:09.949
Anyway, look, sorry. I'm banging on
about work.

29:11.198 --> 29:12.984
It's good to see you.

29:13.358 --> 29:15.857
- Coffee.
- Yeah.

29:42.598 --> 29:47.638
Woohoo... What do you say, Nath?

29:48.198 --> 29:50.334
You still weeping over your lost morals?

29:50.918 --> 29:53.037
Right, so you're just gonna sit
there resenting me.

29:53.038 --> 29:54.797
Even though I'm the one
paying for all this shit.

29:54.798 --> 29:56.878
I'm the one with the plan, the cash,
the talent...

29:58.758 --> 30:01.317
I mean, what do you actually bring
to the table, Nath??

30:01.318 --> 30:03.917
Y'know, I used to think I was
just looking out for you.

30:03.918 --> 30:08.118
But you know what the term is for
someone like you? Leech!

30:09.678 --> 30:15.237
You know what? There.
Think of it as 'fuck off' money.

30:15.238 --> 30:16.197
What?

30:16.198 --> 30:18.557
I don't need that rain cloud over
your head pissing all over me.

30:18.558 --> 30:19.558
Go on. Get lost.

30:23.278 --> 30:25.998
You know what, Jay, you always
were a prick.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.896
But you used to be a good brother.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.745
Mum'll be turning in
her grave right now!

30:31.882 --> 30:34.157
Funny how luck changes someone, isn't it?

30:34.158 --> 30:37.598
Right, give us some space, go
on! Quickly. Move! Move!

30:39.958 --> 30:42.438
- Thank you!
- How'd you find me?

30:42.478 --> 30:45.166
- Your brother called me.
- What!?

30:45.198 --> 30:47.637
You're losing it, Jay!
Alright, you need help, mate!

30:47.638 --> 30:49.917
So you enlist a flipping
copper, you idiot?

30:49.918 --> 30:51.477
I'm not here to arrest you.

30:51.478 --> 30:53.797
I want you to stop using the
bracelet, before it's too late.

30:53.798 --> 30:56.517
You seriously still selling me
that comic book shit?

30:56.518 --> 30:57.647
Okay.

30:59.940 --> 31:01.912
- Find the Queen of Hearts.
- What?

31:01.913 --> 31:04.068
Just do it. If it's not there I'll leave.

31:13.798 --> 31:15.558
- No way...
- Jack of Diamonds.

31:22.398 --> 31:23.757
It's obviously a trick deck.

31:23.758 --> 31:26.475
- Name a card.
- Eight of Clubs.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.542
Pick one.

31:31.782 --> 31:33.037
I told you.

31:33.038 --> 31:34.278
It's the bracelet.

31:35.118 --> 31:36.397
No. It's not.

31:36.398 --> 31:37.998
- Jay...
- You can feel it.

31:38.632 --> 31:41.317
Every since you started wearing it,
how everything changed.

31:41.318 --> 31:42.597
You're addicted already.

31:42.598 --> 31:44.397
It's not the flipping
bracelet, alright!?

31:44.398 --> 31:45.398
Jay. My head really hurts...

31:45.399 --> 31:47.437
This is all just some big fucking con!

31:47.438 --> 31:49.317
I'm having my first good run in
years, I'm not about to let

31:49.318 --> 31:52.163
- some Celtic tosser ruin it!
- I'm just trying to help you, mate.

31:52.164 --> 31:54.277
- Jay. My head doesn't feel right...
- Just stay the hell away from me.

31:54.278 --> 31:56.533
- Jay!
- You alright?

31:57.398 --> 31:58.878
Nathan!

32:04.998 --> 32:11.917
Nathan. What are you doing? Nathan?
Nathan? Nathan? He is not breathing!

32:11.918 --> 32:13.398
Nathan!

32:38.104 --> 32:39.864
What are you doing in here?

32:40.397 --> 32:42.093
These are Harry's old files.

32:43.384 --> 32:45.703
- This is private.
- Why are you looking at them?

32:45.704 --> 32:48.223
D'you think they have something to
do with what happened to Harry?

32:48.224 --> 32:50.543
I saw you talking to
Anna Clayton earlier.

32:50.544 --> 32:52.183
Please sir, if someone's trying to
hurt Harry,

32:52.184 --> 32:53.983
you have to tell me about it.

32:53.984 --> 32:55.747
I can't discuss this.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.263
Not yet.

32:59.264 --> 33:00.617
Where are you going?

33:01.024 --> 33:02.623
Sir, what the hell is going on?

33:02.624 --> 33:05.974
You watch your tone, Suri.
Remember who's in charge here.

33:10.064 --> 33:16.386
Look, I'm, I'm sorry.
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

33:17.904 --> 33:22.264
Thank you. Thanks for all your help.

33:34.944 --> 33:36.343
What was that about?

33:36.344 --> 33:40.343
I don't know. But I'm officially
done being kept in the dark.

33:40.344 --> 33:44.831
- What are you doing?
- Enlisting a grass.

33:53.264 --> 33:54.722
What are we gonna do with him?

33:55.224 --> 33:59.690
I'm working on it. But tell you,
we're not gonna abandon him.

34:00.624 --> 34:02.504
Can't become like Isabella.

34:11.184 --> 34:12.424
How you holding up?

34:15.583 --> 34:17.902
How the hell could he have had a
brain aneurysm?

34:17.904 --> 34:21.978
Nathan's twenty one. He don't
even drink, he's healthy.

34:22.024 --> 34:23.641
I don't think it works like that.

34:25.309 --> 34:27.183
So you're not messing with me, are you?

34:27.184 --> 34:30.822
You really believe this is
a lucky bracelet.

34:30.824 --> 34:33.708
I know it sounds a complete bollocks.

34:34.583 --> 34:37.183
But the sooner you start believing it,
the more you'll be able

34:37.184 --> 34:38.516
to protect yourself.

34:40.744 --> 34:45.956
So, so Nathan dying...

34:48.925 --> 34:50.463
that's really cos of me?

34:50.464 --> 34:53.674
The luck has to balance itself out.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.862
That's why we need to
teach you all we can.

34:56.864 --> 34:58.864
Before you lose anything else.

34:59.344 --> 35:01.304
I've got nothing left to lose.

35:16.148 --> 35:18.148
_

35:18.304 --> 35:19.728
Excuse me.

35:22.624 --> 35:23.903
Harry.

35:23.904 --> 35:24.784
Suri?

35:24.785 --> 35:27.143
That's right. Got fed up of
you dodging my calls.

35:27.144 --> 35:28.303
Suri. This is not a good time.

35:28.304 --> 35:29.942
We've been investigating
what happened to you.

35:29.943 --> 35:33.543
Winter sent us to the crime scene,
and I saw him talking to Anna earlier.

35:33.544 --> 35:35.823
I don't think he believes it was an
accident and now he's left

35:35.824 --> 35:37.503
the office and won't say
where he's going.

35:37.504 --> 35:38.504
Listen to me.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.359
Track his phone, send me his
destination.

36:07.984 --> 36:09.676
Harry's medicine's dealing with it.

36:13.183 --> 36:14.863
This is mine.

36:16.264 --> 36:19.503
When things started going
right, I thought I was

36:19.504 --> 36:22.965
finally getting a silver lining for
all the shit I'd gone through.

36:24.104 --> 36:28.224
But this, this thing.

36:29.917 --> 36:31.886
It ain't a reward, is it?

36:32.704 --> 36:34.366
It's a punishment.

36:36.984 --> 36:40.823
You put it on me. Take it off.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.910
I've tried... It won't budge.

36:44.704 --> 36:49.063
Please. I can't be this person
anymore. Take it off.

36:49.064 --> 36:51.068
I'm sorry, I can't, it won't come off.

36:52.438 --> 36:54.024
What you talking about?

36:55.109 --> 36:58.748
The bracelet stays with you
till the day you die.

36:59.664 --> 37:01.584
I'm sorry I can't change that.

37:54.384 --> 37:56.584
I really hoped you wouldn't come.

37:58.864 --> 38:01.864
There isn't a witness that lives
opposite.

38:04.730 --> 38:05.770
You tricked me.

38:08.184 --> 38:09.735
I'm afraid I did.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.076
It didn't occur to me at first.

38:15.264 --> 38:17.836
The fact that Harry
accused you of murder,

38:18.725 --> 38:19.983
and that very same

38:19.984 --> 38:22.063
night he wound up in a tragic accident.

38:22.064 --> 38:23.869
I was vindicated of that charge.

38:23.870 --> 38:25.824
Yeah. And I believed you.

38:29.464 --> 38:31.863
But I've been in this job a long time.

38:31.864 --> 38:34.344
You stop being able to ignore your gut.

38:38.104 --> 38:39.943
And I just couldn't shake it off.

38:39.944 --> 38:44.583
The way everything seemed to line up
so neatly to make sure Harry died.

38:44.584 --> 38:47.647
The leak. The accident. Falling cable.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.121
And you know what the strangest
thing was?

38:50.984 --> 38:53.183
It extended to his cases too.

38:53.184 --> 38:58.664
All of these criminals dying in the
most mysterious circumstances.

39:02.744 --> 39:05.632
- Bad luck.
- I don't believe in luck.

39:10.184 --> 39:13.103
C'mon... C'mon, Alistair, pick up...

39:13.104 --> 39:15.824
- Please leave a message after the tone.
- Bollocks!

39:18.544 --> 39:19.783
Suri, tell me?

39:19.784 --> 39:22.823
I've got him,
Seventeen West Walk, Latimore Road.

39:22.824 --> 39:24.537
That's the road where I died.

39:24.538 --> 39:27.304
Yeah, I know. Why would Winter go there?

39:28.502 --> 39:31.064
I think he's in serious trouble.
Suri, get back-up!

39:42.384 --> 39:43.864
Where did you get that?

39:44.152 --> 39:47.143
After I met you and Harry at the
fight club,

39:47.144 --> 39:48.343
I needed a quick getaway.

39:48.344 --> 39:50.583
Like magic, this, this Porsche pulls up.

39:50.584 --> 39:52.463
Found this in the glove compartment.

39:52.464 --> 39:54.063
I thought I was on a fucking roll.

39:54.064 --> 39:57.718
Everything I wanted just kept
appearing. But Nathan...

40:01.202 --> 40:05.031
Na, Nathan, he cottoned on to it.
He told me to stop.

40:06.064 --> 40:08.183
Only, he's the one who got punished
'cause I wouldn't stop.

40:08.184 --> 40:09.493
Jay... Please put the gun down.

40:09.494 --> 40:13.000
You did this to me.
You put it on my fucking wrist.

40:13.024 --> 40:14.690
You knew what was gonna happen.

40:15.784 --> 40:18.987
I know, I... made a mistake.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.904
Will the bracelet bring Nathan back?

40:29.304 --> 40:32.237
Will the bracelet bring Nathan back?

40:32.238 --> 40:36.264
No! No, I'm sorry... N, No.

40:44.704 --> 40:49.459
Please, Jay, don't. Please don't.

40:50.824 --> 40:52.784
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

40:54.824 --> 40:56.866
No!

41:04.184 --> 41:06.623
Where were you the night
of the accident?

41:06.624 --> 41:07.823
I already told you.

41:07.824 --> 41:09.863
Right. The soup kitchen.

41:09.864 --> 41:13.503
You see, I called them, and they
didn't have an event that night.

41:13.504 --> 41:18.897
In fact, they have no record of any
volunteer named Isabella Augustine.

41:20.464 --> 41:21.876
And there was something else.

41:22.449 --> 41:25.659
Anna Clayton saw a car following her.

41:26.304 --> 41:29.103
All the way from their house,
to the scene of the accident.

41:29.104 --> 41:31.823
Harry was electrocuted by a pylon cable.

41:31.824 --> 41:33.223
What do other cars have to do with that?

41:33.224 --> 41:34.365
Maybe nothing.

41:34.366 --> 41:37.183
But she remembers what the vehicle
looked like and she could

41:37.184 --> 41:39.823
probably identify it if requested.

41:39.824 --> 41:42.783
Was that your car, Isabella?

41:42.784 --> 41:45.021
You'd never put someone away with that.

41:47.544 --> 41:49.103
You're probably right.

41:49.104 --> 41:52.238
I just wanted to know for
myself, if you were involved.

41:53.262 --> 41:55.067
And now I do.

42:02.744 --> 42:04.206
When I met you,

42:07.253 --> 42:09.534
I thought you must've been...

42:12.504 --> 42:13.579
sent.

42:17.023 --> 42:19.925
I spent so long wishing for you.

42:21.144 --> 42:23.335
And now I know who you are.

42:24.624 --> 42:27.583
And I will see to it that you're
brought to justice for what

42:27.584 --> 42:28.750
you've done.

42:31.397 --> 42:33.447
If you confess now,

42:35.507 --> 42:37.863
your sentencing will be more lenient.

42:37.864 --> 42:43.863
If not, rest assured we'll find the
evidence to put you away for

42:43.864 --> 42:45.683
a long time.

43:05.824 --> 43:07.144
Goodbye, Isabella.

43:16.504 --> 43:18.184
Alistair.

44:12.904 --> 44:18.184
It's such a shame, we could have
parted so amicably.

46:09.424 --> 46:10.901
So who's next?

46:11.508 --> 46:12.924
If I kill her, I lose.

46:14.104 --> 46:17.703
If you don't, we all lose.

46:17.704 --> 46:20.697
I want SO19. Men on the streets.
A cordon round her house.

46:20.698 --> 46:22.183
And I have to be there.

46:22.184 --> 46:24.503
We have no chance of catching
her unless I am there.

46:24.504 --> 46:26.703
We have to get Daisy.
She is going to come for you.

46:26.704 --> 46:28.183
You have to suffer, Harry Clayton.

46:28.184 --> 46:32.343
Lose everything, so you can see
the world as she does.

46:32.344 --> 46:34.383
If you had to put your last
penny on one person...

46:34.384 --> 46:36.063
Who would it be?

46:36.064 --> 46:37.383
So how will you beat her?

46:37.384 --> 46:40.704
You've no chance without this.
