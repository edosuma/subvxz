00:32.377 --> 00:35.069
Whoa!
That bank was so nice...

00:35.104 --> 00:37.416
I think I'll rob it twice!

00:43.284 --> 00:45.735
Ha ha ha! Who says crime
doesn't pay?

00:45.769 --> 00:47.116
-We do!
-Huh?!

00:47.150 --> 00:49.083
Stop right there,
Duplikate.

00:49.118 --> 00:52.569
Your days of multiplying
are numbered.

00:52.604 --> 00:54.606
Get it?
-Ugh!

00:54.640 --> 00:55.814
Ha ha ha!

00:55.848 --> 00:57.643
All right, all right,
all right!

00:57.678 --> 01:00.543
Let's fight!
Hah! Hah!

01:00.577 --> 01:04.961
Okay, girls, execute operation
Cruise Control Crush!

01:04.995 --> 01:07.550
Right!

01:07.584 --> 01:08.999
Huh?

01:09.034 --> 01:11.105
No! what are you doing?!

01:11.140 --> 01:13.142
-Following the plan.
-No, you're not.

01:13.176 --> 01:16.214
The plan calls for red
four-door sedans!

01:16.248 --> 01:17.594
Those are blue coupes!

01:17.629 --> 01:19.286
Who cares?! Just move

01:19.320 --> 01:21.219
and let us
hurl rubber at this wacko!

01:21.253 --> 01:24.912
Hey, girls, why don't you
double down on that idea?

01:24.946 --> 01:26.534
Hyah!

01:31.815 --> 01:33.162
This has been fun, girls,

01:33.196 --> 01:35.750
but I've got a date
with a copy machine.

01:35.785 --> 01:38.581
Let's do this again sometime!

01:38.615 --> 01:42.309
No way, Duplikate!
I hate sequels!

01:44.552 --> 01:46.313
Aaaah!

01:47.728 --> 01:50.524
Ah! Blossom!

01:50.558 --> 01:54.597
Oops!
Time to split -- take two!

01:54.631 --> 01:55.356
I found her!

01:55.391 --> 01:57.772
-Really? Me, too!
-Huh?

01:57.807 --> 01:59.567
Twice, actually.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.779
Hey, Blossom, why did
the burglar mop the floor?

02:04.814 --> 02:06.126
I don't know, Blossom,
why?

02:06.160 --> 02:09.370
Because he wanted
to make a clean getaway!

02:11.476 --> 02:15.859
Three times the Blossoms can
only equal one thing -- trouble.

02:15.894 --> 02:18.793
Hmm. Well, as long as
the amount of daughters

02:18.828 --> 02:22.901
I have is a prime number,
everything's hunky dory by me!

02:24.247 --> 02:25.524
It's like Duplikate's ray

02:25.559 --> 02:28.078
brought all of my
nightmares to life.

02:28.113 --> 02:31.841
I don't think it's a nightmare.
At least our chores are done.

02:33.118 --> 02:35.500
I got it!

02:35.534 --> 02:38.468
Free puppy adoptions
for the whole neighborhood!

02:38.503 --> 02:40.367
No, thank you!

02:40.401 --> 02:42.817
You're right!

02:42.852 --> 02:45.751
This is a nightmare.

02:47.236 --> 02:50.860
Yes, Mr. Mayor?
Infernus is at it again?

02:50.894 --> 02:52.413
We're on our way!

02:52.448 --> 02:56.106
Ay-yi-yi!
Let's go, Bubbs.

02:56.141 --> 02:59.248
When will
this nightmare end?

03:01.905 --> 03:03.769
Let's blast this steampunk!

03:03.804 --> 03:06.151
Ha, ha! Good one!

03:12.709 --> 03:14.573
At least we can
agree on one thing.

03:14.608 --> 03:16.541
-What?
-Five Powerpuff Girls

03:16.575 --> 03:20.130
means five times
the bad guy butt whuppings!

03:20.165 --> 03:22.616
-Yeah!
-Are you ready?!

03:22.650 --> 03:23.893
Bring 'em on!

03:23.927 --> 03:26.275
Let's do this!

03:26.309 --> 03:28.967
It's clobbering time!

03:29.001 --> 03:30.244
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

03:30.279 --> 03:32.212
Let's get
that hothead!

03:32.246 --> 03:34.144
Huh?

03:34.179 --> 03:36.699
Oh, come on!

03:36.733 --> 03:39.529
Wow, Blossom!
That was a great plan!

03:39.564 --> 03:41.600
Don't thank me --
thank Blossom!

03:41.635 --> 03:43.809
Oh, I couldn't have
done it without Blossom.

03:43.844 --> 03:47.261
Blossom? Can we talk to you
over here for a minute?

03:47.296 --> 03:48.297
Sure!

03:48.331 --> 03:50.644
Uh, just Blossom One.

03:50.678 --> 03:53.785
Anything you can say to me,
you can say to Blossom.

03:53.819 --> 03:55.062
You've gotta choose!

03:55.096 --> 03:58.479
It's either us
or the gruesome twosome!

03:58.514 --> 04:01.448
I'm not leaving the Blossoms --
they're great!

04:01.482 --> 04:03.898
Fine!
Then we quit!

04:03.933 --> 04:05.935
Yeah!
Wait, what?

04:05.969 --> 04:07.557
Fine, then go then!

04:07.592 --> 04:09.179
Fine! We will!

04:09.214 --> 04:10.595
Fine! Fine!

04:10.629 --> 04:11.837
Fine! Fine!

04:11.872 --> 04:14.978
Come on, Bubbs.
Let's form our own super team.

04:15.013 --> 04:16.601
We'll be a duo so dynamic,

04:16.635 --> 04:19.086
they'll make a bunch
of movies about us.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.605
I like movies.

04:21.951 --> 04:23.677
I don't understand.

04:23.711 --> 04:25.161
Why do we need costumes?

04:25.195 --> 04:27.163
What's wrong with
what we have on now?

04:27.197 --> 04:28.509
Ugh!
Do I have to teach you

04:28.544 --> 04:30.856
everything about
being a superhero?

04:30.891 --> 04:32.513
No!

04:32.548 --> 04:33.997
Yes.

04:34.032 --> 04:37.346
Bubbs, we need new costumes
to hide our secret identities

04:37.380 --> 04:40.210
from those who would
hurt the people we love.

04:40.245 --> 04:44.456
Not the people I love --
I love them!

04:44.491 --> 04:48.840
Yes. Hence the threads.
Check this one out!

04:48.874 --> 04:50.359
It's tough, it's gruff,

04:50.393 --> 04:53.223
and it shoots rockets
out of its face!

04:53.258 --> 04:55.709
Hmm.
I like that one.

04:55.743 --> 04:57.642
It comes with stickers.

04:59.402 --> 05:01.853
I can't believe
Bubbles and Buttercup

05:01.887 --> 05:03.337
wanted to get rid of you.

05:03.372 --> 05:06.892
Ugh! This whole thing has put me
in a place of stress.

05:06.927 --> 05:10.206
A nice glass of strawberry milk
ought to calm my nerves.

05:11.380 --> 05:13.451
It's all gone!

05:13.485 --> 05:16.005
But I'm the only one
who drinks it!

05:17.213 --> 05:18.973
Mmm. Yummy!

05:19.008 --> 05:23.253
Uh, well...
maybe I'll just read my book.

05:23.288 --> 05:24.496
I've been dying to finish

05:24.531 --> 05:26.533
"The Girl With
the Dragon Sticker."

05:26.567 --> 05:28.673
I hear the twist ending
is great.

05:28.707 --> 05:30.744
Ooh, ooh!
You mean when they discover

05:30.778 --> 05:32.262
that they're on
planet Earth...

05:32.297 --> 05:34.575
The entire time?

05:37.302 --> 05:39.200
Maybe I'll clean.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.583
Already did it!

05:45.137 --> 05:47.036
Hello, Mayor.

05:47.070 --> 05:48.762
Duplikate is back?!

05:48.796 --> 05:50.902
We're on our way!

05:53.214 --> 05:55.216
Whoo, boy!

05:55.251 --> 05:56.873
Stealing is so much fun!

05:56.908 --> 05:58.599
I think I'ma do it again.

05:58.634 --> 06:02.396
And again, and again, and again,
and again, and again...

06:02.431 --> 06:04.053
and again, and again, and...

06:04.087 --> 06:06.400
You and what army?

06:06.435 --> 06:09.852
What army? Ha ha, what army?!

06:09.886 --> 06:12.544
How about this army?!

06:16.168 --> 06:20.207
For a minute there, I thought
stealing a tank was a bad idea.

06:20.241 --> 06:22.105
-Me, too!
-Me, too!

06:22.140 --> 06:23.141
Me, too!

06:23.175 --> 06:24.211
Uh-oh.

06:24.245 --> 06:26.731
Duplikate squadron, fire!

06:28.180 --> 06:30.390
Agh!

06:31.321 --> 06:33.703
There's too many of them.
Ah!

06:33.738 --> 06:35.740
We need a plan!

06:35.774 --> 06:38.846
Ooh, I got it!
Operation Tank Top!

06:39.847 --> 06:41.470
No way!

06:41.504 --> 06:44.542
We should be doing Operation
Tanks for the Memories!

06:44.576 --> 06:47.648
Ooh,
that's a good one, too!

06:47.683 --> 06:50.824
Well, we better
decide quick!

06:50.858 --> 06:53.240
We can't dodge forever!

06:53.274 --> 06:55.173
You can't rush
these decisions, Blossom.

06:55.207 --> 06:58.487
We have to pick the perfect plan
and follow it exactly.

06:58.521 --> 07:00.799
You know what we
really need, Blossom?

07:00.834 --> 07:02.663
I couldn't agree more,
Blossom.

07:02.698 --> 07:05.183
Focus testing!

07:05.217 --> 07:07.461
No! We don't have time
for that!

07:07.496 --> 07:11.016
Blossom, you can always
make time for focus testing.

07:11.051 --> 07:12.915
Wait, no!

07:12.949 --> 07:15.193
The Blossompuff Girls
are in trouble!

07:15.227 --> 07:18.507
Quick, turn on
the Butter-Bubbs signal!

07:18.541 --> 07:20.198
Uh, don't you have
their phone number?

07:20.232 --> 07:21.510
C-can't we just call them?

07:21.544 --> 07:22.752
Do I have to teach you

07:22.787 --> 07:25.030
everything about
being a superhero?

07:25.065 --> 07:26.169
No!

07:26.204 --> 07:27.688
Yes.

07:33.349 --> 07:35.731
We're needed!

07:44.049 --> 07:45.292
Holy tanks-giving!

07:45.326 --> 07:47.639
Duplikate's up to
her old tricks again!

07:47.674 --> 07:51.125
Stand aside, citizen.
We'll handle this Duplikate!

07:51.160 --> 07:54.957
Bubbs-wonder, do you have...
your utility belt?

07:54.991 --> 07:56.372
-Yup.
-Great!

07:56.406 --> 07:58.857
We can
use them as whips!

07:58.892 --> 08:00.652
Goole goole goole
goole goole!

08:00.687 --> 08:02.585
Goole goole goole goole --

08:04.449 --> 08:06.796
That's a lot of tanks.
Oof!

08:06.831 --> 08:09.558
Aah!

08:09.592 --> 08:11.387
I think they went
this way!

08:11.421 --> 08:12.906
Whew!

08:12.940 --> 08:14.563
Buttercup, Bubbles?

08:14.597 --> 08:17.876
What?! How do you know
our secret identities?

08:17.911 --> 08:19.395
Hi, Blossom!

08:19.429 --> 08:21.984
Lucky guess.
But thank goodness you're here!

08:22.018 --> 08:25.021
What happened to
the ribbonhead twins, huh?

08:25.056 --> 08:27.714
I thought having more
Blossoms would be better.

08:27.748 --> 08:30.233
But they're stuck
doing focus testing!

08:30.268 --> 08:33.374
Now, raise your hand if you want
a crime-fighting plan

08:33.409 --> 08:36.342
that's more wacky or zany.

08:36.376 --> 08:39.380
Great. Now raise your hand if
you want a crime-fighting plan

08:39.414 --> 08:43.212
that's more down
to earth and real.

08:43.246 --> 08:44.454
Interesting.

08:44.489 --> 08:47.009
Yeah.
I think we need a plan.

08:47.043 --> 08:48.389
Got any ideas?

08:48.424 --> 08:50.599
Me?
None of my plans worked --

08:50.633 --> 08:52.359
and there were three of me!

08:52.393 --> 08:57.364
That's because your plans were
missing two key ingredients!

08:57.398 --> 08:58.952
Milk and eggs!

08:58.986 --> 09:01.299
Uh, no, Bubbles.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.889
Ugh! Us.
I was talking about us.

09:04.923 --> 09:06.131
Oh! Neat!

09:06.166 --> 09:09.134
Well,
I do have one plan.

09:10.619 --> 09:13.242
There they are! Fire!

09:13.276 --> 09:16.314
Okay, go!

09:16.348 --> 09:18.765
Over here!

09:18.799 --> 09:19.593
Huh?

09:19.628 --> 09:22.596
Turn around,
double dork!

09:28.188 --> 09:29.983
Wait, Bubbles, Buttercup!

09:30.017 --> 09:33.538
You're not following the precise
turns I planned exa-- Aah!

09:36.023 --> 09:37.818
Random it is.

09:38.992 --> 09:40.614
I can't
get a read on 'em!

09:40.649 --> 09:44.411
All this zig-zagging
is making me see double.

09:44.445 --> 09:47.483
Okay, initiate phase two!

09:50.486 --> 09:52.315
Hey, they stopped!

09:52.350 --> 09:54.524
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

09:57.873 --> 10:02.602
I swear, you got the wrong
Duplikate-Kate!

10:02.636 --> 10:05.087
I was just a pawn
in her game!

10:05.121 --> 10:06.467
Take her away!

10:06.502 --> 10:08.746
And her away, and her away,
and her away,

10:08.780 --> 10:11.127
and her away,
and her away!

10:11.162 --> 10:13.543
Thank you, Blossom,
Bubbles, and Buttercup!

10:13.578 --> 10:15.200
Job well done!

10:15.235 --> 10:16.685
Aw, come on!

10:16.719 --> 10:19.964
Do secret identities mean
nothing to any of you?

10:19.998 --> 10:23.692
Well, now that we took care of
all those duplicate Duplikates,

10:23.726 --> 10:25.832
I guess it all worked out.

10:25.866 --> 10:29.629
Yup! And absolutely
zero loose ends!

10:29.663 --> 10:32.839
Totally!
Right, Blossoms?

10:32.873 --> 10:34.703
Ooh.

10:34.737 --> 10:36.636
Welp, I'll go
get the shovel.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.639
-That won't be necessary.
-Dang it.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.881
We've decided
to hit the road

10:40.916 --> 10:43.573
in pursuit of our
fortune elsewhere.

10:43.608 --> 10:45.472
But what will you do?

10:45.506 --> 10:48.682
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

10:48.717 --> 10:50.684
Raise your hand if you think
that we should open up

10:50.719 --> 10:52.582
our own strawberry
milk factory.

10:52.617 --> 10:54.032
Great.
Now raise your hand

10:54.067 --> 10:56.552
if you think we should run
for public office

10:56.586 --> 10:58.071
and work our way up
to become

10:58.105 --> 11:00.314
supreme rulers
of the known universe?

11:00.349 --> 11:01.384
Interesting.
