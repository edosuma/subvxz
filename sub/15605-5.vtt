(narrator)
'Ex On The Beach is back.'

00:13.360 --> 00:15.120
'This time it's all stars.'

00:15.200 --> 00:19.040
'Old faces return for another shot
at finding love.'

00:19.120 --> 00:21.880
Am I looking for love? Fucking yeah!

00:21.960 --> 00:24.480
"They'll have
to endure their exes...'

00:24.560 --> 00:26.960
I've never, ever felt like this
in my life.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.720
'Some will have
to deal with old grudges...'

00:30.800 --> 00:33.800
Babe, you've had more dicks
than I've had sun beds.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.720
'As hard as they try
to find their perfect match...'

00:36.800 --> 00:38.840
Right, who wants to finger me?

00:38.920 --> 00:43.320
'Standing in their way
will be the Tablet of Terror.'

00:43.400 --> 00:45.760
I'm cacking myself big time.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.920
'It's going to be hotter
than ever before...'

00:49.000 --> 00:51.040
I wanna ride her. Giddy up, Amy.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.120
'...as emotions boil over...'

00:53.200 --> 00:57.840
You made me realise there's more
to life than what I was just doing.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.760
'...tensions run high...'
I fucking dare ya!

01:00.840 --> 01:02.200
Let's fucking go, kid.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.360
'...and the claws come out.'
...in your face...

01:05.440 --> 01:07.160
(shouting)

01:07.240 --> 01:12.040
'As always,
they'll never know whose...'

01:12.120 --> 01:14.720
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.360
'...ex...

01:16.440 --> 01:17.680
...is...

01:19.000 --> 01:20.200
...next.'

01:20.280 --> 01:22.840
I did not think
that I was gonna feel like this.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.360
Olivia, someone needs to go home.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.200
Liam or Ashley?

01:44.280 --> 01:47.840
I'm so sorry, Liam.
I'm gonna have to say you.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.320
Stitched right up.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.240
Weird, man.
I think you've been disrespectful.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.560
I think you owe me an explanation.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.440
I'm sat with the girls.
I'm telling them my side.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.160
Look what he's done to me
and I've not reacted.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.880
I've just had to deal with it.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.960
They're all choked and upset.

02:08.039 --> 02:11.200
I feel guilty that I've been
with Gaz the past few nights.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.320
Lillie is fit.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.320
I just wanna... (growls)

02:16.400 --> 02:18.960
Has it detected if she fancies me
or not?

02:19.040 --> 02:21.880
Don't know what I'm gonna do
about Charlotte.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.760
Why are you over here?
You're making me look like an idiot.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.400
He says he's not bothered
about Jemma but he is.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.200
Why are you sat explaining
yourself to Jemma?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.800
Chill out.
Fuck off.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.960
She's shown her true colours.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.000
Holly went crazy yesterday.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.960
Last night, I went a bit psycho.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.240
Yeah.
That come out of nowhere.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.640
Nasty.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.680
I wouldn't have just got pissed off
at nothing.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.720
I feel what Holly did yesterday
is bang out of order, like.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.720
I'm already over Holly.
I've pied her, in my head.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.520
I was annoyed that I came round

03:18.600 --> 03:21.320
and you were talking
about the same situation.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.280
I don't know whether I mentioned
I was a bit of a bunny boiler,

03:25.360 --> 03:26.520
he knows it now!

03:26.600 --> 03:28.920
Morning, guys!

03:29.000 --> 03:34.920
I was so taken aback when
Jem told me she'd slept with Gary.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.440
It's not nice to come into that.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.280
She was supposed to be my friend.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.680
This place is a bit overwhelming.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.840
Was that blond always
or was it grey?

03:48.960 --> 03:50.160
Looks better blond.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.680
Seeing Lillie,
it does bring back feelings.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.320
This isn't a bird I've banged.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.360
We need to talk,
and until we've done that,

03:58.440 --> 04:00.680
I couldn't tell you
what's gonna happen.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.960
I really do like Gary.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.440
And after spending
a lot of time with him,

04:07.520 --> 04:09.600
the feelings are getting stronger.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.200
But last night, his ex came in.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.760
I just can't bring myself
to tell her.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.800
It's a bit of a weird situation.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.519
I don't want to get hurt.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.079
Lillie's walked in
and she's gorgeous.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.720
Funny. Clever.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.080
I'm gonna kiss her face.

04:25.160 --> 04:29.160
I need to have a chat with Charlotte
and tell her it's finished,

04:29.240 --> 04:32.760
cos I want to crack on with Lillie,
with nothing in the way.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.200
(narrator) 'There might be one thing
getting in the way.'

04:36.280 --> 04:38.000
'Someone else's ex.'

04:38.080 --> 04:40.520
'They're packed
and primed for trouble.'

04:40.600 --> 04:43.680
'Next ex, T minus 16 hours.'

04:45.520 --> 04:47.320
'With cracks forming,

04:47.400 --> 04:50.720
the Tablet of Terror has decided
to send everyone on a boat.'

04:50.800 --> 04:53.000
'Let's hope nobody
ends up overboard.'

04:53.960 --> 04:56.240
So excited. We're going on a boat!
Whoo!

04:56.320 --> 04:59.240
(all cheering)

05:00.720 --> 05:04.160
We're having the most amazing
boat party!

05:04.240 --> 05:06.640
(all cheering)

05:16.080 --> 05:18.600
Let's toast to having good times
and good fun.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.440
Let's get fucking pissed!

05:20.520 --> 05:23.160
The sea looks great.
The girls look amazing.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.320
Drinking. Music.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.240
Couldn't wish for anything better.
Get in there.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.440
(music plays)

05:39.560 --> 05:41.560
That's your favourite line.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.960
Bear is just making me smile.
I'm enjoying being around him.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.200
You've just made me feel welcome.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.000
No, you won't.
Promise.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.080
No, you won't.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.800
Lillie's way of dealing with this
is to take her attention elsewhere.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.400
She's concentrating on Bear
to take her mind off me.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.680
I want to take the opportunity
while me and Hawley are sober

06:13.760 --> 06:15.960
to clear the air,
get it out in the open.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.880
It's getting relentless,
this tit for tat game.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.200
I want it to stop.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.200
We keep shouting at each other,
doing stuff to piss each other off.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.640
I'm sorry for what I've done
and said,

06:26.720 --> 06:29.360
but I want to draw a line under it
and just get on.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.400
Hawley and Jemma are having a chat.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.760
It worries me a little bit

06:33.840 --> 06:36.760
cos I'll be gutted if Hawley
pies me, I quite like him.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.160
It's like I keep hurting you,
you keep hurting me.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.040
It's the Jemma that I know.
This is why I was with her.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.040
When she's calm, she's mint.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.440
Not just be civil.
I want to be your friend.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.720
Cos I like you, so...

06:55.560 --> 06:57.160
You know I do. I've told you.

06:58.840 --> 06:59.840
Yeah, I know.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.800
I've still got feelings for you.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.880
Otherwise I wouldn't get upset
and neither would you.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.840
Love or hate,
there's something there.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.080
It's frustrating.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.320
I know he still loves me
but I don't think he'll tell me.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.320
I know.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.240
I understand that. I understand.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.960
It's good to hear Jemma
finally say sorry.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.160
For what she's done,

07:26.240 --> 07:29.240
I don't know if I'll be able
to forgive her and move on.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.920
She's not going to have with you
what I had.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.200
Definitely.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.280
What?

07:46.240 --> 07:47.240
I did warn her.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.600
It's really stupid of her
to get involved in this...

07:50.680 --> 07:52.720
This is fucking deep.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.880
I know what she's like.
Bunny boiler.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.760
Stop doing stuff to hurt each other.

08:03.840 --> 08:08.000
Me and Hawley are finally over
the whole game-playing situation.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.920
I do believe he still loves me
and wants me back.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Cuddle?

08:15.360 --> 08:18.080
'It might be civil now,
but brace yourselves.'

08:18.160 --> 08:20.840
'World War Three
is about to break out,

08:20.920 --> 08:23.680
with the next ex exploding
onto the scene.'

08:23.760 --> 08:26.000
'T minus 12 hours.'

08:26.080 --> 08:28.720
(evil cackle)

08:36.080 --> 08:39.720
It's time to put Charlotte
out of her misery and end things.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.280
I want different things.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.480
I've gone on a date,
had the best time with Lillie.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.720
It was fun.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.000
We really got on.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.480
Maybe I shouldn't have
strung you along...

08:50.560 --> 08:53.160
I don't know if you thought that
there was more.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.240
I'm worried how she'll take it.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.240
I've spent a couple of days with her

08:57.320 --> 08:59.720
and she thinks I like her
more than I do.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.840
I'm not expecting
a fucking relationship or anything.

09:02.920 --> 09:07.080
I dunno. I was excited to see you
when you got back, and like...

09:07.160 --> 09:08.680
Fucking, whatever.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.560
I know it's not fair on you,
but I wanted to be honest with you.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.680
Just... I like her more.

09:16.480 --> 09:20.000
He's got the cheek to tell me
he fancies Lillie more than me.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.880
Fucking hell, mate.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.960
I am dying to pour this drink
all over you.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.320
But I don't wanna waste it.
Fucking twat.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.400
I don't want to be pressured into
having a girlfriend.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.400
Oh, my God. I don't understand
why you think like that.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.840
Why was you crying, babe?
I wasn't.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.880
Everyone loves you. Honestly.
You're amazing.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.480
Don't let Bear make you feel
like a cunt.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.560
All we've done is spoon
and a blowjob.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.160
It was good. The best.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.960
You're a fucking gimp.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.240
I don't want a relationship.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.440
I think you're acting like
I'm more bothered than I am.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.920
I liked you. I think you're fit.
I get on with you.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.480
But my main thing is like, I know.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.880
I feel like someone's gonna come in.
My ex, who I do wanna get back with.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.040
I know she likes me.
But because I don't like her,

10:16.120 --> 10:19.800
she's like, "Oh, I don't care.
I've got my ex to think about."

10:19.880 --> 10:21.080
You're lying.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.720
When you split up,
that should be it.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.320
How the hell can you say that?
You know fuck all about me.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.840
Cos they don't want you.
Shut the fuck up.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.000
You're pissing me off.
Bore off. You're actually painful.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.680
I regret going there with Bear.
What's the fucking point?

10:37.760 --> 10:39.400
He's got a tiny dick.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.920
See you by the dancefloor.
Fucking Bear off!

10:43.000 --> 10:46.640
Seriously, babe,
you need to chuff the fuck off.

10:56.480 --> 11:01.080
We are all fucking buzzing for this.
Let's get the night fucking going.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.360
Never have I ever had a threesome.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.960
Ninety per cent of the villa drank.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.200
Never have I ever had a wank
in the villa.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.880
Jemma has though!

11:13.960 --> 11:15.200
Oops!

11:15.280 --> 11:18.840
Never have I ever been in love
with someone who's here now.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.040
Never ever have I done something
in this villa I regret.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.200
Hm.
Olivia.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.560
Fuck.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.280
I seriously need to tell Lillie
that I've got with Gaz,

11:38.360 --> 11:40.000
but it's so awkward.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.440
Never have I ever touched
Gary Beadle's dick in this villa.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.920
It's supposed to be a game.
Everyone's out to hurt one another.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.720
I'm not like that.
That's not my nature.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.560
Do we have to say that?

11:52.680 --> 11:55.440
"Touch"?
Through the pants or literally?

11:55.520 --> 11:57.280
(Jordan) Who's touched it?

11:57.360 --> 11:58.880
Oh, wow.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.520
I'd have never of thought
she'd do that.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.840
(indistinct chatter)

12:03.920 --> 12:06.000
You touched it, Charlotte.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.080
I haven't touched his dick.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.120
Don't fucking lie, Charlotte.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.760
It's none her business.
Stay the fuck out.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.440
She went like that.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.800
Slapped it.
Who drank?

12:17.880 --> 12:20.600
Gemma, Olivia.
Did you drink as well?

12:20.680 --> 12:22.320
I slapped it, apparently.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.520
Best not tell porky pies here
cos you two went to the penthouse.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.960
But I never touched it.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.600
I didn't get wanked off,
she didn't suck it.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.880
We did nothing.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.560
You said they were fighting
over your it.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.440
When have the words
"fighting over my dick"

12:42.520 --> 12:43.720
come out of my mouth?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.640
I'm just speechless.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.080
I kissed him.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.000
We kissed and we went to bed.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.480
Who did you kiss?

12:50.560 --> 12:51.800
What?

12:51.880 --> 12:54.000
Lillie's asking questions.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.000
Who did you kiss?
Charlotte and Olivia.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.000
We didn't do anything.
You didn't tell me that.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.800
It was a three-way kiss.
I just got here as his ex.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.400
I'm single.
I can do what the fuck I want.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.560
What's happened between you both?

13:07.640 --> 13:11.960
Me and Gary have been in the same
bed for two or three nights.

13:12.040 --> 13:16.040
I'm not bothered about Charlotte
cos I think it was a bit of a joke.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.480
But I feel like Olivia
has maybe been hiding something.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.760
We've not had sex.
We've messed about.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.240
Have you kissed?
Yeah.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.120
Why is she saying...
Like...

13:26.200 --> 13:29.640
Olivia is lying. I'm taking all
the guilt for getting with Gaz.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.440
She's sat like a princess.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.480
Has his dick been inside you?
Yes, it did.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.600
His willy went inside for how long?

13:36.680 --> 13:38.880
Why do I have to explain
how many seconds

13:38.960 --> 13:41.960
his dick's been inside of me?
Could have been an hour.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.880
Who fucking cares?

13:43.960 --> 13:46.200
I'm single. He's single.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.840
Thank you!
She's making out we had sex.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.800
Olivia had the tip in.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.400
What the difference, babe?
Look it up, it's called sex.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.280
I don't have a problem
with you getting with people.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.680
My problem is that
I really did like Olivia

14:01.760 --> 14:04.240
and she hasn't even told me
she's kissed you.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.200
She's had 24 hours to mention it
before she got to know me.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.240
It should have been
the first thing she said to me.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.600
The first thing I did was tell you.
That's what you should have done.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.760
That's a big thing.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.400
Because Lillie's your friend.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.240
I don't know Lillie.
I can tell her when I want.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.800
She's your friend!

14:23.880 --> 14:25.800
She's your friend!

14:25.880 --> 14:28.120
You had the same dick as me,
admit it.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.320
Olivia told me
you put your dick in her twice!

14:31.400 --> 14:34.120
Oh, wow!
First night. The other night.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.880
Yo, I'm loving this.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.720
Tell me when we've had sex.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.720
I turn over, she's wet, I'm naked,

14:40.800 --> 14:44.520
it literally...
I'm talking that much.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.360
A dick inside you is sex.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.040
Jemma. Jemma.
Why are you doing this?

14:50.120 --> 14:53.280
Jemma, you horsed get all over.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.400
Olivia hasn't actually had full sex.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.520
There's a difference.
You're a slag.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.680
(narrator) 'Takes one to know one.'
Jemma. Jemma!

15:00.760 --> 15:02.120
Why are you doing this?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.200
Why are you doing this, seriously?

15:04.280 --> 15:09.400
Jemma, you've been rattled, like,
fucked by two guys,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.080
and you're trying to make out
I have, too?

15:12.160 --> 15:15.040
Digging us out in front of Lillie?
Bring it on.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.400
I feel so sorry for Lillie.
She deserves a cuddle.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.280
Cos you two are bezzies now, are ya?

15:21.360 --> 15:24.160
He's getting aggressive
cos he's upset.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.240
Don't have a go at me
for having fun.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.800
You did exactly the same.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.400
I admit to what I've done.
You don't.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.120
You sit there like a princess
and you've had the same cock as me.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.840
It's two-two. Don't be nasty.

15:35.920 --> 15:40.360
You've had two dicks in you.
Sex is dick in pussy.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.240
I'm just too trustworthy.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.120
I think people are nice
when they're not.

15:46.520 --> 15:50.360
Jemma, you'd fucking bang anyone.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.040
Oh, really?
Yeah, you would.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.760
If someone took you
to the penthouse, you'd bang them.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.640
I don't know why I'm crying.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.800
It's the whole, like, situation
just...

16:08.400 --> 16:10.600
(narrator) 'Save your tears, Lillie.'

16:10.680 --> 16:13.160
'Things are about to go
from bad to worse.'

16:13.240 --> 16:15.680
'The next ex is ready
to wreak havoc

16:15.760 --> 16:18.840
and they'll be washing up
in T minus eight hours.'

16:30.560 --> 16:33.480
How's everyone feeling today?
Got a bit silly.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.440
Morning.
Hi.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.960
I feel a bit isolated
and on my own today.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.800
Jemma has completely
thrown me under the bus.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.880
Trying to make out
that I'm a liar, slag, bitch.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.880
But I'm not. She is.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.960
My head's
a bit all over the place.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.560
Just feel a bit sad
about last night.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.920
Olivia's been acting like my friend.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.920
The whole time she slept with Gary.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.160
It's just a bit of
an uncomfortable situation.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.680
Second night, Lillie,
in the crazy villa.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.480
Can't get any worse, can it?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.319
Gaz denied he fucked Olivia.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.920
Now it's all come out.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.440
Do I care? No.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.359
I just wanna kiss Lillie.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.920
'She's Bear's girl now.'

17:26.000 --> 17:28.440
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

17:28.520 --> 17:30.600
Bear and Lillie. Billie!

17:30.680 --> 17:33.360
Hawley, ever since
he's had the chat with Jemma,

17:33.440 --> 17:36.240
has been off with me.
I don't know where I stand.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.640
I just hope that we can
properly sort things out.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.040
I'm single, and I like Lillie.
She's got the whole package.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.280
I'd like to get
to know her more so...

17:46.920 --> 17:48.960
It's just good times from now.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.840
(narrator)
'With Gary getting found out,

17:53.920 --> 17:57.080
the Tablet of Terror
has given him an opportunity

17:57.160 --> 17:58.760
to make amends with Lillie.'

17:59.960 --> 18:03.040
We need this date to talk.
It's gonna be hard.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.080
I don't know what she's gonna say.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.800
I'm actually looking forward to it.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.120
We had the best relationship.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.960
I'd still vouch for that.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.080
We had an amazing relationship.
There was nothing bad.

18:15.160 --> 18:19.040
And you went from that
to we broke up at an airport

18:19.120 --> 18:20.360
and never spoke again.

18:20.440 --> 18:24.560
I want him to really take in
and take on board

18:24.640 --> 18:26.960
what an idiot and nasty person
he's been.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.040
And I want him to feel bad for it.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.000
I think it's sad
that if I never came out here,

18:32.080 --> 18:36.160
I don't think we'd have ever had
this conversation.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.720
I didn't have time to go
and sit down and have a coffee

18:39.800 --> 18:42.400
and discuss it.
I had to be somewhere else.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.720
It's shit,
but that's the life I live.

18:44.800 --> 18:50.080
I was with Gary, and all I've seen
since the break-up is Gaz.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.640
It's not you.
That's not who you are.

18:52.720 --> 18:56.240
I, honestly, hand on heart,
do think Gary was the one.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.720
I've never loved anyone
the way I loved him.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.600
Maybe the Gary I was with
was, like...

19:09.440 --> 19:12.840
Was that real? Was that, like...

19:16.760 --> 19:19.120
Lillie knows the real me.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.200
Like, how I am at home,
or with my family.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.720
That's the hardest thing.

19:23.800 --> 19:28.000
She's thinking that's slipping away
but it's not. I'm still me.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.800
So you're saying
the way I am with you

19:30.880 --> 19:32.880
and the way I am around my family,

19:32.960 --> 19:36.160
you think that was all
just a fucking act?

19:37.560 --> 19:38.720
No, that is me.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.320
I don't know how you could do what
you've done to me and my family.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.600
I'd have done anything for you.
I loved you.

19:45.680 --> 19:50.040
I didn't want to have to justify
why we broke up to the whole world.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.840
It was no one else's business.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.960
But you made it everyone's business.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.640
You tweeted,
the day after we broke up,

19:56.720 --> 19:58.080
without saying to me,

19:58.160 --> 19:59.600
"Lil, just to let you know,

19:59.680 --> 20:02.560
I think I've got to write
something publicly."

20:02.640 --> 20:04.680
I hadn't told my friends and family.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.960
Yeah, but why would you not think,
"I should probably tell Lillie

20:10.040 --> 20:12.400
because I'm gonna tell
my followers."

20:12.480 --> 20:15.840
Tell me how you would have
dealt with me doing that.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.960
'With Gaz and Lillie on their date,

20:24.040 --> 20:27.560
Bear is confident nothing
is going to get in the way of Billie.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.080
What do you think Lillie's gonna do?
Think she'll go back?

20:31.160 --> 20:34.840
I've given Lillie a bit of space.
A lot's going on at the minute.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.360
It's obvious she likes me.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.160
I don't give fuck what Gaz thinks.
I don't.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.240
She seems pretty strong, like...

20:41.320 --> 20:44.520
I give credit to her
cos when I spoke with my boyfriend,

20:44.600 --> 20:46.600
I couldn't leave him alone.

20:46.680 --> 20:51.120
I think Gaz feels like he's lost her
and he's missed out on a good thing.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.320
I'm really happy spending time
with Gary, at the minute.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.280
But if Gary came back and says,

20:57.360 --> 20:59.560
"I still have feelings
for this girl",

20:59.640 --> 21:02.520
he wants to crack on with her,
that wouldn't be good.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.600
If your bird comes in and fancies me.
I might crack on.

21:05.680 --> 21:06.800
I'm single.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.240
Yep.
Whatever.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.960
No loyalties to anyone.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.120
What...
What was the reason we broke up?

21:22.800 --> 21:26.200
That was one of the hardest
decisions I've ever had to make.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.360
At the point where we were at
in our relationship,

21:30.440 --> 21:33.880
or picking your work.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.480
It's all I've ever had in my life.
The only thing I'm half good at.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.200
Like...

21:39.280 --> 21:40.920
That's what I've got used to.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.160
I just had to pick what I thought,
at the time, was best for me.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.920
As hard as that was,
it meant leaving you.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.720
In my crazy, hectic life
over the past five or six years,

21:51.800 --> 21:54.600
that's the only girl
I've ever made my girlfriend.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.880
She knows me.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.280
That's why that choice was so hard.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.280
I'm sorry for the way
I treated you after.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.560
I'm sorry I didn't message
your family.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.440
They were nothing but nice to us.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.200
Seeing Gary so upset confirms,
for me,

22:20.280 --> 22:23.800
that it was as real and as hard
for Gary as it was for me.

22:23.880 --> 22:28.560
I kinda didn't have time to stop
and think about seeing you

22:28.640 --> 22:30.920
or speaking to you again. So...

22:31.000 --> 22:33.640
(sighs)

22:33.720 --> 22:35.600
I can accept...

22:35.680 --> 22:39.120
I know you're sorry.
I knew the second I got on the beach.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.040
I could see guilt in your eyes.
I knew you felt bad. I get that.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.080
I know he is the Gary that I loved.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.160
Sometimes the best people
in your life do hurt you.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.680
The best memories of my life
were with you.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.200
You made me realise

22:59.280 --> 23:02.440
that there's more to life
than what I was just doing.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.240
And since I've been with you,

23:04.320 --> 23:07.880
the amount of people who've said,
"You've matured so much".

23:07.960 --> 23:10.920
That I've changed. It's cos of you.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
I can never, ever thank you enough
for that.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.600
You did make us grow up a lot.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.080
It's just hard, man.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.880
This isn't just someone
I slept with. It's real life.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.240
(tablet chirps)

23:36.320 --> 23:37.720
(all groan)
Here we go!

23:37.800 --> 23:39.800
It's having my fucking life.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.040
Good afternoon, all stars.
Don't get too comfortable.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.200
It's beach time.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.400
Jemma, Holly and Ashley,

23:46.480 --> 23:48.840
get ready to find out
whose ex is next.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.880
What the fuck!

23:53.040 --> 23:56.600
Fuck off Tablet of Terror.
I've got enough shit going on.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.400
What the hell!

23:58.480 --> 24:00.560
I've cleared things up with Hawley.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.000
This is the last thing we need.

24:03.080 --> 24:06.120
(high-pitched) I don't wanna go!

24:06.200 --> 24:08.680
(narrator)
'Squeal all you like, Holly,

24:08.760 --> 24:13.720
but you'll be screaming blue murder
when the next ex comes crashing in.'

24:13.800 --> 24:15.600
'T minus 3 hours.'

24:15.680 --> 24:18.000
(evil cackle)

24:24.040 --> 24:25.680
How about your ex?

24:26.880 --> 24:28.200
Fucking hate him.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.000
It will kick off if he comes in.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.520
Will he be pissed off you got
with Hawley?

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
Probably.
Yeah?

24:33.680 --> 24:37.120
I hope it's Holly's ex
that comes out because part of me

24:37.200 --> 24:40.600
wants to get revenge on her for
shagging my ex in front of my face.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.320
It's not going to be
a good situation for any of us

24:43.400 --> 24:45.080
but we've got to deal with it.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.840
(squeals)
Come on, come on.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.280
I wanna go home!

24:50.360 --> 24:53.680
Literally, I'm going to be sick
on everyone.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.600
I'm trying to block out the fact
it could be my ex.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.800
To say I'm not nervous,
I'd be a liar.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.560
I've got a lot of fucking exes.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.680
I'm scared as fuck.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.600
(sighs) I don't know whether to be
nervous or what.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.360
If Scott came out,
he's Hawley's best mate.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.760
So much drama.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.320
Could you imagine coming out
as my ex? Fuck that.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.080
If Scott came in,
I don't know what I'd do.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.440
Especially as my ex,

25:19.520 --> 25:21.840
when he's Hawley's best mate,
like...

25:21.920 --> 25:23.280
Nah.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.480
Gonna be sick over everyone!

25:25.560 --> 25:27.680
I think that it could be
my ex Conor.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.400
He's a little prick.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.800
He slept with loads of girls.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.360
Did you love him?
I really cared about him.

25:34.440 --> 25:38.560
I know now that he did cheat on me
and I'm really annoyed about that.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.800
I feel really, really nervous.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.560
(exhales) I'm so scared!

25:47.040 --> 25:49.480
Is Lillie single, ready to mingle?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.840
(all) Oh!
Hi!

25:53.920 --> 25:55.280
You all look nice.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.760
Oh, my God, we're not ready.
I'm so sweaty.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.600
How yous doing? Yous all right?

25:59.680 --> 26:02.040
I'm hoping Lillie and Gaz
have moved on.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.880
A bird you wanna get with.
I want to get to know her.

26:04.960 --> 26:09.800
We both needed that.
We cried like absolute babies.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.760
I couldn't speak
because I was crying that much.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.240
A chat we should have had
five months ago.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.040
All I needed was for Gary to,
like...

26:19.640 --> 26:22.520
...acknowledge how he's made me feel
and say sorry.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.760
To move forward.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.160
And I feel like we've done that now.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.760
Now that Gaz and Lillie
have cleared up their issues,

26:29.840 --> 26:32.200
I feel like me and Gaz
can progress.

26:32.280 --> 26:36.400
'Don't be so optimistic, Olivia.
This is Ex On The Beach.'

26:36.480 --> 26:39.760
'Things are about to take
a turn for the worse.'

26:39.840 --> 26:43.040
'Strap yourselves in,
the next ex is almost here.'

26:46.120 --> 26:50.680
'Back on the Beach of Doom,
things are about to get very messy.'

26:51.240 --> 26:52.920
I just feel sick.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.360
Gonna be sick over everyone!
(retches)

26:55.440 --> 27:00.040
I feel confused, if Scott
would even dare turn up here.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.920
Think he would?
Don't think so.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.840
If he comes in, World War Three
is about to kick off.

27:06.760 --> 27:10.480
Whatever comes out of that sea
is going to be extra fucked up.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.320
Can I have another drink?

27:17.440 --> 27:19.280
I feel sick.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.880
Are you fucking serious?

27:37.800 --> 27:38.840
All right.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.480
How are you?
Don't touch me.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.000
My name's Conor.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.640
I'm a promoter for one of
London's most exclusive night clubs.

27:47.720 --> 27:50.600
People call me The Poser.
Got the girls. Clothes.

27:50.680 --> 27:53.840
Got the whip, the apartment.
Smashing London.

27:53.920 --> 27:58.600
I party with around 60-100 girls
on a weekly basis.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.360
Course I do all right.
I'm a fucking weapon.

28:01.440 --> 28:05.040
It's be pretty shameful of me
if I didn't take a few girls home.

28:05.120 --> 28:10.040
My ex, Holly, we got on really well.
We used to bang all the time.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.320
I'm coming out to see
if it's something

28:12.400 --> 28:14.520
we could take a bit further.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.000
Absolute weapon.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.040
Conor, I know that it's true.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.360
What's true?

28:20.440 --> 28:22.400
That you shagged half of Dstrkt.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.440
Five minutes, you're kicking off.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.960
Conor, what do you expect me to say?

28:27.040 --> 28:30.760
I wish he'd just say,
"Yeah, I shagged half of London."

28:30.840 --> 28:33.240
I wouldn't care...
Well, I would care.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.640
How many times did I ask?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.760
Five minutes,
you're kicking off.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.800
What the fuck's happened?

28:38.880 --> 28:41.080
She's gone at me like a dog.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.680
When did you even have time to sleep
with all these girls?

28:44.760 --> 28:46.200
I'm staying at your house.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.520
How have I?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.440
Are you still...
Course I am!

28:49.520 --> 28:52.560
Conor, just fucking admit it!
Fucking admit it!

28:52.640 --> 28:54.920
Are you fucking serious?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.280
How many times...

28:56.360 --> 28:59.240
How many times have I asked you?
Holly.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.200
What the fuck? She is going crazy.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.560
You're a fucking nutcase. A weirdo.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.320
Who the fuck does he think
that he is?

29:07.400 --> 29:12.360
I give my mum a fucking kiss goodbye
and I'm cheating on her with my mum!

29:12.440 --> 29:14.160
She's got no proof of nothing.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.400
You accuse me every time.
Shut up, Conor.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.520
What the fuck is she doing?

29:19.600 --> 29:22.920
She's having a go at a guy
for sleeping with loads of girls

29:23.000 --> 29:24.440
and yet she's fucked my ex.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.600
Holly's not exactly a saint.
She's been shagging my ex.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.080
Why are you saying that?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.400
Who the fuck does Jemma
think that she is?

29:31.480 --> 29:33.680
It's my place to tell him.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.120
Is that true?

29:36.200 --> 29:39.040
Are you fucking joking?
Why are you saying that?

29:39.120 --> 29:41.720
She's just a fucking wind-up
little tramp.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.040
She's just jealous
cos her ex fancied me.

29:44.120 --> 29:48.440
Jemma, why would you say that now?
Don't fucking start at me!

29:48.520 --> 29:50.440
I thought we'd sorted it out!

29:50.520 --> 29:52.680
Why would I have any loyalties
to Holly

29:52.760 --> 29:56.040
and why would she think that
I would? That's fucking crazy.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.880
Why are you starting?
I'm on this girls' team.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.200
Why are you bringing it up now?
(shouting)

30:02.280 --> 30:04.840
I'm so buzzing.
Finally got my revenge.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.840
Why are you trying to embarrass me?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.800
Everyone can fuck off.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.960
I can't deal with this shit!

30:15.800 --> 30:19.840
'The Tablet of Terror
has sent everyone on a night away.'

30:19.920 --> 30:22.640
'Hopefully they're on
their best behaviour.'

30:24.120 --> 30:26.640
Oh, my God, it's amazing.
Cheers, everyone.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.840
Cheers.
Here's to our first night out.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.080
To good times. No arguments.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.120
I'm having the best night ever.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.320
Lillie's over there,
she's gorgeous. Yes!

30:36.400 --> 30:40.160
I'm gonna put this out there.
I fancy Lillie. She's gorgeous.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.720
I would like to kiss you.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.040
I got to play it cool.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.560
That was very cool.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.760
Now Gary and I have sorted
things out,

30:46.840 --> 30:50.440
I'm ready to move on
from that chapter of my life.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.960
I do fancy Bear. He's hot.

30:53.040 --> 30:56.200
We have a massive
physical attraction to each other.

30:56.280 --> 31:00.360
Lillie, I'm happy
that you've moved on.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.880
The thought of Lillie and Bear
cracking on should annoy me,

31:03.960 --> 31:05.280
but it doesn't.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.400
That's how I know
there's no feelings still there.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.320
Party people.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.400
Conor!
Hello!

31:11.480 --> 31:13.320
Where's Holly? Where's Holly?

31:13.400 --> 31:17.040
We're all having a few drinks,
having some banter.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.840
Next thing we know,
we've got Jem and Ash walk in.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.760
Who's this fucking breadstick?

31:21.840 --> 31:23.480
He's Conor. Holly's ex.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.560
He's our VIP guest.
Tonight is all about him.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.680
Cheers!
To Conor!

31:28.760 --> 31:32.200
The mood has just dropped.
I have no idea what's gone on,

31:32.280 --> 31:34.080
but I know that it's not good.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.480
What is your intention?
Do you wanna get back or have fun?

31:37.560 --> 31:40.000
I came in to see if we could
take it further.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.840
Jemma dropped a bomb.
Dunno who she's slept with.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.480
It was me.
It's me!

31:44.560 --> 31:46.440
Awkward.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.920
I'm like, "Fuck it." That's
my free pass to do what I want.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.480
Me and Holly, totally done now.
See you later, love.

31:53.560 --> 31:55.080
Holly, are you OK?

31:55.160 --> 31:58.320
Well, I've had better days, Bear.
Put it that way.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.280
So, are you two friends?
Are you two all right?

32:01.360 --> 32:03.560
Well, I do think it was a bit harsh.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.160
You jumped out of your chair
and went for me.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.360
Did she?

32:07.440 --> 32:10.440
I have unfinished business.
I'm not gonna forget it.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.320
We're not arguing now.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.240
Oh, are we not? OK.
Well, shut up!

32:14.320 --> 32:16.280
Shut up!
Fuck off.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.880
Let's have a fucking good night.
It's his first night.

32:19.960 --> 32:23.440
We do not wanna have a kick-off.
'Wishful thinking.'

32:28.840 --> 32:30.800
I'm having a fucking shit night.

32:30.880 --> 32:34.600
But I think I need to clear the air
and sort things out with Hawley.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.840
So, I just feel like
since we had that argument,

32:41.920 --> 32:43.280
you've been really off.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.160
I just feel like you used me a bit.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.400
I slept with you.
I started to like you.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.280
Then you've gone back to Jemma.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.080
It's about time we moved on.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.040
There wasn't anything in it.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.160
That's what spurred me
to make things civil with Jemma.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.760
You had no right in...
OK, I'm a bunny boiler.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.480
I don't like bunny boilers
or swillers.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.760
Them two combined is like, "Ta-ra."

33:03.840 --> 33:06.600
I found out the hard way,
but I'm glad I found out.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.640
I'd rather us just be friends.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.360
He thinks that I'm a bunny boiler
and he doesn't want any more shit.

33:12.440 --> 33:16.640
Babe, it's just cos you wanna
get back with Jemma. Just admit it.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.960
At the end of the day,
Jemma was right.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.400
She told me you were using me,
and you did.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.000
You did.
I didn't use you.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.680
Honestly, I can't be bothered
to talk about it.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.280
She was right
and I should've listened to her.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.800
I'm fucking so angry

33:31.880 --> 33:34.120
that he used me
and made me look like a mug.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.200
Bye.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.960
'You might be angry now, Holly,

33:40.040 --> 33:43.440
but you'll be fuming when the next ex
heats up the villa.'

33:44.360 --> 33:47.640
'Whose ex is next?'

33:51.800 --> 33:53.720
Oh!
Oi-oi!

33:53.800 --> 33:54.800
Party!

33:54.880 --> 33:56.960
Just quickly. Quickly, guys.

33:57.040 --> 34:00.160
As it's Conor's first night,
let him choose the game.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.800
What do you fancy playing?

34:01.880 --> 34:05.000
Let's just play spin the bottle.
Get a bottle. Spin it.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.320
Keep it simple.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.520
(narrator)
'Somebody's played this before.'

34:09.600 --> 34:13.440
I couldn't think of anything worse
that I want to be doing.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.440
(all) Conor!

34:16.520 --> 34:17.760
Yeah.

34:17.840 --> 34:21.600
I dare you to fucking lick
Kayleigh's tits.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.000
That's not awkward!

34:25.080 --> 34:28.159
What the fuck, like,
are you joking me?

34:28.239 --> 34:31.040
Are you winding me up?
Are you winding me up?

34:31.120 --> 34:32.360
(squeals)

34:32.440 --> 34:35.159
Pipe down, for fucks sake.
It's just a game.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.639
(all) Bear!
Go, Bear.

34:39.719 --> 34:42.600
I dare you to kiss Lillie.
I'll have a snog.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.480
Tonight's the night, I think.
I'm excited.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.960
(laughter)

34:51.719 --> 34:54.040
Bear just fucking swoops in.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.159
What the fuck?

34:55.239 --> 34:58.120
Another free date! Grab a room!

34:58.200 --> 35:00.560
(cheering)

35:00.640 --> 35:04.080
Game changer, innit?
It's the bottle's fault.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.480
Gaz.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.880
Truth or dare.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.360
I dare you to snog Lillie
for three seconds.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.360
Why would you do that?

35:16.440 --> 35:18.680
I'll do it if you want to do it.

35:18.760 --> 35:22.240
Bear's purposely hitting on
the real side of things

35:22.320 --> 35:23.440
with me and Gary.

35:23.520 --> 35:26.720
It's not a game if you're
touching on the real emotions.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.560
Five seconds!
One!

35:29.640 --> 35:31.320
Two! Three!

35:31.400 --> 35:32.880
Four!

35:32.960 --> 35:34.000
(all) Aww!

35:34.080 --> 35:36.480
This is the most awkward
situation ever.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.600
(cheering)

35:39.680 --> 35:43.080
Mate, you wouldn't ever
get a bite out of me.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.320
I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.560
My turn!

35:46.640 --> 35:48.520
Truth or dare, Livs.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.680
Dare.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.600
I dare you to kiss...

35:54.520 --> 35:56.400
...Gaz.

35:56.480 --> 36:00.240
That's really uncomfortable.
That's the person I did love.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.240
Why's it always me?

36:04.600 --> 36:06.120
Five! Four!

36:06.200 --> 36:07.560
Three!

36:07.640 --> 36:09.640
Two! One!

36:12.760 --> 36:15.040
I am really being pushed
to my limit now.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.240
You all right?

36:19.560 --> 36:20.800
Why are you crying?

36:20.880 --> 36:22.560
Stop crying.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.480
Why are you crying?
Shut up!

36:24.560 --> 36:28.120
I feel like Bear's trying
to create an awkward situation.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.400
I don't know Lillie well enough
to know if she's awkward.

36:35.480 --> 36:36.640
Maybe I scared her.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.560
(narrator)
'Don't worry about that, sunshine.'

36:41.640 --> 36:45.000
'You'll all be scared shitless
when the next ex arrives

36:45.080 --> 36:46.640
to wreak havoc.'

36:46.720 --> 36:49.200
'Whose ex is next?'

36:50.120 --> 36:53.880
'In case you're wondering,
nope, they haven't gone to bed.'

36:53.960 --> 36:55.800
'They're still paying that game.'

36:55.880 --> 36:57.080
Conor.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.200
Would you rather spoon Holly

37:00.280 --> 37:02.400
or Kayleigh, tonight?

37:02.480 --> 37:04.120
Kayleigh.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.600
Did you see her face?

37:06.680 --> 37:07.840
Why would I not?

37:07.920 --> 37:09.280
You having a laugh?

37:09.360 --> 37:11.720
Who the fuck does Conor think he is?

37:19.360 --> 37:22.200
She thinks she can come in here,
sleep with a geezer,

37:22.280 --> 37:24.480
and I'd pick her.
Is she fucking mad?

37:24.560 --> 37:26.240
Why would you not?

37:26.320 --> 37:27.720
Right, seriously.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.840
(squealing)
Shush. Shush.

37:29.920 --> 37:30.920
(growls)

37:31.000 --> 37:32.360
Conor! Conor!

37:32.440 --> 37:33.880
Shush.
Fucking shush!

37:33.960 --> 37:36.600
(shouting)
Are you joking?

37:36.680 --> 37:38.600
Holly is a fucking lunatic.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.840
(Holly shouting)

37:41.920 --> 37:45.120
Are you joking me?
(screaming) Are you joking me?

37:45.200 --> 37:46.560
Get off me!

37:46.640 --> 37:50.560
Honest to fucking God, I don't
understand what the fuck happened.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.560
(screaming) Get off me!

37:53.200 --> 37:55.840
Are you fucking joking me?

37:55.920 --> 37:58.680
Fucking cunt!

37:58.760 --> 38:01.000
I don't care if you want
to shag Kayleigh.

38:01.080 --> 38:04.400
Just say me.
Don't make me look like a mug.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.840
Shut up, Holly! You're boring!

38:06.920 --> 38:09.440
Is Jemma joking?
Just leave it.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.960
Is Jemma joking?
Stop it.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.040
Come on, then. Come on, then.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.960
Holly is just so annoying.
Just... (squealing)

38:16.040 --> 38:17.360
Yapping Chihuahua.

38:17.440 --> 38:20.400
I'm fine. I'm so chilled.

38:20.480 --> 38:23.160
Holly is a few sandwiches
short of a picnic.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.920
She's fucking crazy.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.080
Gaz, your go.

38:26.160 --> 38:29.360
Holly, would you rather
fuck Jordan

38:29.440 --> 38:31.520
or get back with Conor?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.760
Definitely fuck Jordan.
I'd do it now.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.600
Bollocks, though.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.200
Two can play that game.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.600
He's desperate.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.240
He's gone for my sloppy seconds.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.720
(shouting)

38:47.800 --> 38:49.400
Go, Jordan!

38:50.200 --> 38:53.280
Fucking bonkers, mate.

38:53.360 --> 38:53.560
