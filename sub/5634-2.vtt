<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.091 --> 00:11.720
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.803 --> 00:14.723
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.806 --> 00:18.101
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:21.396
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

00:21.480 --> 00:22.981
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.065 --> 00:24.399
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:24.483 --> 00:29.947
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:35.118 --> 00:36.620
<i>We now return</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:39.623

Always Rings 400 Times.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.131
So is everybody excited
for Father's Day on Sunday?

00:48.215 --> 00:49.550
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.969
I always try to avoid
Father's Day now.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.971
Every year, I used to take
my dad to the horse track.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.057
Now we just go rooting around
for bargains at the mall.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.643
- Oh, this is darling, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.562
Glenn, do you think you'd see
my bra through this blouse?

01:01.645 --> 01:02.646
Uh, I don't know.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.648
- Is it too sheer?
- I don't know what that means.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.066
Glenn? Do you think
it's too sheer?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.651
I said I don't know!

01:07.734 --> 01:10.237
Hey, Joe, you know, come to think of it,
I've met Cleveland's dad,

01:10.320 --> 01:12.072
and my dog slept
with Quagmire's dad,

01:12.155 --> 01:13.657
but I don't know anything
about your dad.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.075
Yeah, is he
still with us,

01:15.158 --> 01:17.661
or is he living in Heaven
with Jesus Christ?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.663
Ugh, save that
for your black friends.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.123
Eh, my dad's out
there somewhere,

01:21.206 --> 01:23.083
but I haven't spoken
to him in years.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.168
What? Really?

01:24.251 --> 01:26.003
Sorry, Cleveland,
that was mean of me.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.880
I already forgave you.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.882
But, Joe, why haven't you
seen your dad?

01:29.965 --> 01:32.050
Well, he's a good guy,
but we just drifted apart.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.260
It's no big deal.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.970
It's a very big deal.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.805
My dad's a stinking drunk
who lives in Ireland,

01:36.889 --> 01:38.265
but you got
a perfectly good dad.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.683
You can't waste that.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.351
You gotta call him up
for Father's Day.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.770
Peter, I don't even know
where he is.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.106
Who's ready for another beer?

01:46.190 --> 01:48.275
Hey, Cleveland, weren't you
supposed to buy the next round?

01:48.358 --> 01:50.694
That's a shame Joe
never sees his dad.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.696
I know.
Hey, you know what?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.114
Joe's our friend.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.699
He should be with his dad
on Father's Day,

01:55.782 --> 01:57.117
and we're gonna
track him down.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.119
Yeah, that's a
good idea, Peter.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.704
Well, I like
helping people out.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.165
That's why I was such a good
break-up rodeo clown.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.167
I'm just gonna go
ahead and tell you.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.585
I've been sleeping
with your sister.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.003
What?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.296
Hey, now! Hey, now!
Over here! Over here!

02:09.379 --> 02:11.006
Over here! Hey, now!
Hey, now! Over here!

02:11.089 --> 02:12.341
Over here!
Hey, now! Hey, now!

02:12.424 --> 02:13.425
Over here! Over here!

02:16.929 --> 02:18.430
Oh, and now that
I'm inside the barrel,

02:18.514 --> 02:21.141
he gave you
and your sister HPV.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.396
Hey, want to see something?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.398
Check out how hot
my last patient was.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.443
- Oh. They look fake.
- Yeah, who cares?

02:31.527 --> 02:33.862
Okay, according
to this projection,

02:33.946 --> 02:36.114
Stewie's adult height
will be five-foot-one.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.034
- What?
- Five-foot-one?

02:39.117 --> 02:41.620
Wow, Dr. Hartman,
that's really short.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.040
I mean, I suppose it's fine
if he's gonna die at 14.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.042
Is... Is there anything
on there about that?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.627
Well, we learned
in medical school

02:48.710 --> 02:50.212
that the short ones
do go faster,

02:50.295 --> 02:52.256
'cause they smell more farts
than the rest of us.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.883
This is terrible!
I can't be short!

02:54.967 --> 02:58.136
I'll be an outcast, like Rudolph
the Uncircumcised Reindeer.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.138
Look, Rudolph, it's
not me, all right?

03:00.222 --> 03:02.140
It's Dasher, he's
been complaining,

03:02.224 --> 03:04.142
and he is the one who has
to look at it all night.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.561
I don't know.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.980
Mrs. Claus says
it'll decrease my sensitivity.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.983
I... I'm sorry, why are you
talking to my wife about this?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.864
Okay, you guys,
it's all set.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.448
I found Joe's dad
on the Internet,

03:18.532 --> 03:20.868
and he just e-mailed me
to say he's coming tomorrow.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.036
All right, great, but remember,
this is a surprise for Joe.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.454
Why are you
looking at me?

03:24.538 --> 03:25.873
Because you're terrible
at keeping secrets.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.457
No, I'm not.
I'm great at it.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.585
Like when I was
an OB-GYN.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.170
Well, I got the results
of your ultrasound,

03:31.253 --> 03:32.588
and I got some
news for you.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.006
Wait, wait, wait...

03:34.089 --> 03:35.591
We don't want to know
if it's a boy or a girl.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.009
Oh, okay.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.178
Well, it's
not breathing.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.262
Hey, guys.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.015
Uh, uh, so, Joe,
big day tomorrow, eh?

03:43.098 --> 03:44.183
Father's Day.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.852
Gonna be home all day,
especially at 11:30 AM?

03:46.935 --> 03:47.936
Peter.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.021
What? I didn't say anything about his dad.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.607
My dad?
What about my dad?

03:51.690 --> 03:55.694
Well, now that Quagmire ruined
the surprise, we found your dad!

03:55.777 --> 03:57.946
- You what?
- That's right.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.198
He's coming tomorrow,
for Father's Day.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.200
You shouldn't have
done that, Peter.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.202
My father's not gonna
be happy to see me.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.620
Sure he will.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.205
Just get him one of them
Father's Day cards

04:06.288 --> 04:07.623
what plays a song.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.250
"Dad to the Bone."
"I'm Dad."

04:10.334 --> 04:12.836
Pretty much anything with
"bad," you turn it to "dad."

04:12.920 --> 04:14.838
Wait, w... Why wouldn't
your dad be happy?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.215
What, is he a jerk
or something?

04:16.298 --> 04:19.218
No, it's just that
ever since I was a little kid,

04:19.301 --> 04:22.513
he was constantly making fun
of handicapped people.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.932
- Really?
- Yeah, my whole life,

04:25.015 --> 04:28.101
my... My dad would ridicule
anyone in a wheelchair.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.521
It was all,
"Hey, spaghetti legs!"

04:30.604 --> 04:32.940
And, "Hey, rigatoni legs!"

04:33.023 --> 04:35.526
And, uh, "Hey, angel-hair legs!"

04:35.609 --> 04:38.570
He was a sales manager
at Ronzoni.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.989
Wow, then it must have been
hard for him to accept

04:41.073 --> 04:42.157
when you were
paralyzed.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.575
That's just it.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.994
My dad doesn't know
I'm handicapped.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.246
I never told him.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.666
I never...
I never told him!

04:52.417 --> 04:53.752
Ah, Joe, don't cry.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.337
It's gonna make me cry.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.173
I cry like Snoopy.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.142
I can't believe you invited
my father without telling me.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.978
You guys got to get
in touch with him

05:11.061 --> 05:12.312
and tell him
not to come.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.897
It's too late, Joe,
he's already on his way.

05:13.981 --> 05:14.982
He is?

05:15.065 --> 05:16.316
Yeah, we got him
tickets on Kayak.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.318
It is a nightmare
itinerary.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.320
It was, like, 80 bucks,
but he has four stops.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.114
Two of them are
in Houston.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.282
What am I gonna do?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.576
My dad has no idea
I'm paralyzed.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.578
Well, there's only
one thing we can do.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.996
We'll just figure out a way

05:29.079 --> 05:30.706
to hide your handicap
from your dad.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.708
Hide the fact
that I can't walk?

05:32.791 --> 05:34.293
Peter, that'll
never work.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.129
It's worth a try.
Come on, Joe, don't be so negative.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.881
You're like a Boston
fortune cookie.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.842
"I don't know, numbnuts.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.720
"Maybe buy a garage and fill it
with hockey equipment."

05:44.803 --> 05:46.263
Huh.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.265
Well, let's see
what my lucky numbers are.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.434
"Screw you, math dick."

05:50.517 --> 05:53.228
Well, that wasn't
very helpful at all.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.401
Here you go, Stewie.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.320
I know clothes shopping
always cheers you up.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.072
I can't believe I'm only
going to be five-foot-one.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.616
Aw, come on, look
at the bright side.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.743
You'll be in the front row
of every class picture.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.077
Holding that little plaque.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.370
You suck.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.206
Why don't you go drink out
of the fountain?

06:12.289 --> 06:13.332
I'll text you
when I'm done.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.042
I know you're
trying to be rude,

06:15.125 --> 06:17.294
but I am gonna do that,
because I find it enjoyable.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.217
Excuse me, I was
looking at this.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.302
Sorry, I've made a decision
to go for that shirt,

06:25.385 --> 06:26.678
and when that happens,
it is on.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.305
Full throttle, man. Pow!

06:28.388 --> 06:30.307
Wow, you're an energetic
little fellow.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.309
I guess your mommy lets
you drink coffee, huh?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.895
Whoa, whoa, I... I don't put
stimulants in my body.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.313
You know something?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.731
You kind of remind me
of Tom Cruise.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.150
Boom.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.818
You... You got me, man.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.238
Wow, Tom Cruise.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.241
You look, um...
Bigger in the movies.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.408
Wh... What are you
doing here?

06:48.492 --> 06:51.411
Oh, I get all my clothes from
out-of-the-way toddler stores.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.413
Ooh, uh, you want
an animal cracker?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.249
Sure, you got
a lion in there?

06:55.332 --> 06:56.834
Oh, no,
I eat those first.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.253
I believe eating
the lions gives me power.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.130
Yeah, I hear you believe
in a lot of crazy stuff.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.715
What'd you get there?
A giraffe?

07:03.799 --> 07:06.718
- Yeah.
- Good, good. It's good for eyesight.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.136
Well, you're certainly upbeat.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.138
Let me ask you,
doesn't it bother you

07:10.222 --> 07:12.140
being an adult man
who's that short?

07:12.224 --> 07:13.767
'Cause the doctor says
that's where I'm headed.

07:13.851 --> 07:17.187
Oh, no way, man.
The middle of the word "short" is "or."

07:17.271 --> 07:18.772
"Or" gives you a choice.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.275
And I choose not to be short.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.527
Wow, you need a road map
for that one.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.946
Hey, hey, I'll tell you what.
You spend the day with me,

07:26.029 --> 07:27.531
you'll see how great
it is to be short.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.950
You'll feel like
you're discovering a new world.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.535
And you know what's in
the middle of the word "world"?

07:31.618 --> 07:33.161
Um... "Or"?

07:33.245 --> 07:34.538
Yes!

07:34.621 --> 07:36.290
The dots have appeared, man,
let's connect them!

07:38.041 --> 07:40.460
You're... You're a weirdo,
but let's do this.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.549
All right, check
it out, Bonnie.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.551
This is how we're
gonna fool Joe's dad.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.386
Oh, my God.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.679
Yeah, looks
real, right?

07:50.762 --> 07:53.098
I put this pair of pants
on the front legs of this horse

07:53.182 --> 07:54.516
and strapped Joe
to the front

07:54.600 --> 07:56.518
with his legs tied
behind the horse's neck.

07:56.602 --> 07:59.104
And then we put Cinnamon's head
up the back of Joe's shirt

07:59.188 --> 08:01.398
and simply hid the rest of the
horse behind this curtain.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.484
His breath is very
moist, Peter.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.487
And to induce movement, I'm
gonna snap the horse's balls

08:07.571 --> 08:08.989
with this dampened
kitchen towel.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.325
Aah! Oh, my God!

08:11.408 --> 08:12.492
Holy crap, he's
out of control!

08:12.576 --> 08:14.411
Does it look real?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.040
Plan "B"! Plan "B"!

08:28.800 --> 08:32.137
Peter, I'm
afraid this is hopeless.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.555
What, I don't know
what else to do.

08:33.639 --> 08:34.723
I mean, we're not
gonna come up

08:34.806 --> 08:36.558
with something better
than the horse.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.560
Yeah, I guess you're just
gonna have to tell your dad

08:38.644 --> 08:39.728
about your handicap.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.563
I can't do that.

08:41.647 --> 08:44.483
If you guys were in my shoes,
you'd understand.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.485
Wait a minute, that's it!

08:46.568 --> 08:48.487
I will get in your shoes.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.030
I'll just pretend to be you.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.615
I mean, your dad ain't
seen you in years.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.033
He won't know
the difference.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.451
What? That's crazy.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.871
Boy, that was a close call.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.624
Is some of this room cold?

09:04.545 --> 09:05.963
All right, Peter, almost done.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.884
- Huh? Huh?
- Eh, kind of.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.553
- Yeah.
- I don't care.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.388
Peter, I don't
know about this.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.556
It seems like
a bad idea.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.392
Look, Lois, Joe is one
of my best friends, all right?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.977
I'm only doing this
to help him.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.436
Besides, wait till you hear
my "Joe" voice.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.565
Uh, God, I hate
being stuck in this chair.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.609
No, Peter,
that fights it.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.195
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

09:30.279 --> 09:33.198
<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

09:33.282 --> 09:35.200
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

09:35.284 --> 09:37.286
<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

09:37.369 --> 09:40.205
<i>You're never gonna get my love</i>

09:40.289 --> 09:42.499
<i>Now because you wear</i>

09:42.583 --> 09:45.294
<i>All those fancy clothes</i>

09:45.377 --> 09:46.628
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

09:46.712 --> 09:49.214
<i>And have a big fine car</i>

09:49.298 --> 09:51.133
<i>Oh, yes, you do now</i>

09:51.216 --> 09:52.801
<i>Do you think I can afford</i>

09:52.885 --> 09:54.803
<i>To give you my love</i>

09:54.887 --> 09:56.430
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

09:56.513 --> 10:00.225
<i>You think you're higher</i>
<i>Than every star above</i>

10:00.309 --> 10:02.394
<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

10:03.896 --> 10:05.606
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

10:05.689 --> 10:07.691
<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

10:09.109 --> 10:11.028
<i>You're never gonna make me cry</i>

10:11.111 --> 10:12.654
<i>Mr. Big Stuff</i>

10:12.738 --> 10:13.822
<i>Tell me, tell me...</i>

10:16.742 --> 10:18.827
That's Bud.
Are you ready, Peter?

10:18.911 --> 10:21.246
I think so.
What do you think, acting coach?

10:21.330 --> 10:24.833
I think you will be
exemplary, Peter.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.252
All good acting coaches
are insane old ladies.

10:27.336 --> 10:28.754
Emote!

10:30.839 --> 10:32.758
- Hi, Bud.
- Hi, Joe's dad.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.176
Uh, I mean, uh, Dad.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.636
Uh, Joe, I'm Joe,
you're my dad.

10:35.719 --> 10:36.720
Joe?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.889
Wow, I guess it really
has been a long time.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.390
I barely recognize you.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.767
Put on a little weight,
haven't you?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.852
Well, I could say
the same for you.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.690
Sometimes I don't understand
why people laugh.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.154
All right, everyone in the car.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.114
We got a Father's Day
dinner reservation.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.200
Why is Mr. Swanson coming?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.660
And why is he dressed like Dad?

10:59.743 --> 11:00.994
I don't know, kids.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.039
I stopped asking after your
father said he shot a horse.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.504
Thanks for
the ride-along.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.923
I liked when you sentenced those
two girls to kiss each other.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.717
Yeah, all girls are lesbians
when you point a gun at 'em.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.761
Boy, it's been great
spending time with you, son.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.639
It's been great spending
time with you, too...

11:20.722 --> 11:21.723
Dad.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.686
Oh, this'll be fun.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.104
Let's see how long it takes them

11:27.187 --> 11:28.730
to get Gumby over there
into the car.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.691
Yeah, that's our neighbor,
Peter Griffin.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.317
That's the guy
who e-mailed me?

11:32.401 --> 11:35.362
Huh, no wonder it was all caps
with tons of typos.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.738
He's a water head, right?

11:36.822 --> 11:38.991
Yeah, he's a mess.
Look at his ugly kids.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.909
Pathetic.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.578
Ugh, he's not fitting.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.747
Just put some of him
in the back like skis.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.336
Hey, Stewie.
What's up?

11:51.420 --> 11:52.754
When you
say it like that,

11:52.838 --> 11:54.131
you sound just
like Tom Cruise.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.507
- What?
- Oh, yeah,

11:55.591 --> 11:56.592
I've been hanging
with Tom Cruise.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.635
You've been hanging out
with Tom Cruise?

11:58.719 --> 12:00.762
Sure have.
We spent the whole day together,

12:00.846 --> 12:01.972
and he showed me

12:02.055 --> 12:03.557
there's a lot of
advantages to being short.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.766
Oh, yeah? Like what?

12:04.850 --> 12:06.226
You're the last one
to get wet when it rains?

12:06.310 --> 12:07.561
Well, yeah, that.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.688
And you can chow
pie standing up.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.565
We didn't do any of that,
but the point is,

12:11.648 --> 12:13.150
I'm at peace
with being short.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.776
Full throttle, man!
Pow!

12:16.236 --> 12:17.571
Hello.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.448
Oh, hi,
Dr. Hartman.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.283
Mrs. Griffin,
I have some good news.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.785
Turns out your son
is going to be normal height.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.829
I read his chart wrong
yesterday.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.832
Apparently, I have something
called "dislooxia"?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.626
That was the doctor.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.795
Apparently, Stewie's not
gonna be short after all.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.214
What? Really?

12:35.297 --> 12:36.673
That's wonderful news!

12:36.757 --> 12:38.008
Oh, I'm so relieved

12:38.091 --> 12:40.177
my child is spared
some heartache.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.804
Now, come on, Brian, I guess
we should try to make it

12:42.888 --> 12:43.889
over to Meg's
birthday party.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.644
Could I have some bread
while I open my presents?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.521
At this point,
we're gonna have to start

12:50.604 --> 12:51.980
charging you
for the bread.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.068
Hey, Stewie!
You want to check out the go-kart

12:56.151 --> 12:57.402
I used in <i>Days of Thunder?</i>

12:57.486 --> 12:58.695
Yeah, listen, um...

12:58.779 --> 13:00.989
I just found out I'm
actually going to be tall,

13:01.073 --> 13:03.784
so I'm no longer comfortable
hanging out with someone

13:03.867 --> 13:05.827
whose teeth are bigger
than their fingers.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.996
What?
That's... That's barely true.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.831
Yeah, so...
See you later.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.625
You are making a big mistake,
Stewie!

13:11.708 --> 13:14.795
Nobody walks away
from Tiny Tom Cruise!

13:14.878 --> 13:16.630
Yeah, except for
all three of your wives.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.423
Okay, I'm
shutting this now.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.552
Okay, so... Bye!

13:25.013 --> 13:28.725
So now, since I switched
to disposable catheters,

13:28.809 --> 13:31.895
I no longer have those beet-red
infections in my urethra.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.231
Oh, no.
I hope it's not genetic.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.732
Chris, he's
not our dad.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.818
I can't keep up with this ruse.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.444
Hey, everybody!

13:39.528 --> 13:41.113
Peter, finally,
you're home.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.031
How's it going over there
with my dad?

13:43.115 --> 13:44.825
Awesome. He fell for
the whole thing.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.869
In fact, we've been
having a great time!

13:46.952 --> 13:48.453
Wow, that's
terrific, Peter!

13:48.537 --> 13:50.747
You'll only have to pull it
off for a few more hours.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.667
Then he'll be on a plane
tomorrow and I can go home.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.835
Oh, that's
the other good news.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.295
Bud's not leaving!

13:56.378 --> 13:57.880
I told him he can move in
with me and Bonnie.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.299
- What?
- Peter, this is crazy!

14:00.382 --> 14:01.842
Nah, it's gonna
work out fine.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.051
Oh, and remember, Joe,

14:03.135 --> 14:04.678
if Lois is feeling
frisky at night,

14:04.761 --> 14:07.055
it's index finger
around and clockwise.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.682
And just keep
doing that to yourself

14:08.765 --> 14:09.892
until you're good to go.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.941
Peter, this is ridiculous.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.861
You can't live in my house
with my dad and my family!

14:20.944 --> 14:23.322
Your dad got me
super clean in the tub.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.073
Joe's right,
this is idiotic.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.491
What are you thinking?

14:26.575 --> 14:27.826
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.411
I'm thinking that
I've had two dads

14:29.494 --> 14:32.039
and neither one cared for me
as much as Bud does.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.207
Peter, I've had
enough of this!

14:33.290 --> 14:35.918
- You can't just take my dad!
- Well, he's right next door.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.920
Nothing's stopping you
from going over there

14:38.003 --> 14:39.087
and telling him the truth,

14:39.171 --> 14:41.757
that his son is a paraplegic
who's stuck in a wheelchair.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.008
You know I
can't do that.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.927
Ah, suit yourself.
But I gotta go.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.720
Me and Bud are
having a blast.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.848
I'm sorry, Joe.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.016
A... Are you okay?

14:51.099 --> 14:52.476
Not really.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.228
I'll be honest,
Lois, this hurts.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.896
Hurts like the Dickens.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.106
I've finished
my latest novel.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.900
Splendid, Charles!
What is it called?

14:59.983 --> 15:01.151
<i>Oliver Nipple-Twist.</i>

15:01.235 --> 15:02.236
Ow!

15:02.319 --> 15:03.987
Oh, Charles, you bastard!

15:04.071 --> 15:07.324
Yeah! The Dickens!
It hurts like the me!

15:12.955 --> 15:16.250
So, anyone going to
the gerbil's funeral on Friday?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.376
Okay, kids!

15:17.459 --> 15:19.253
Everyone in a circle
for parachute time.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.256
Oh, goodie,
I love parachute time!

15:24.883 --> 15:27.094
Whee!

15:27.177 --> 15:28.804
Whee!

15:29.596 --> 15:31.098
Whee!

15:31.181 --> 15:32.933
What the hell?

15:33.016 --> 15:35.060
That kid looked like
Tiny Tom Cruise.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.395
Whee!

15:36.478 --> 15:38.605
Huh.
Must've been my imagination.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.774
Aah!

15:40.858 --> 15:42.734
If you think
you're getting away from me,

15:42.818 --> 15:44.403
you've got a crazy laugh
coming, friend.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.282
Aah!

15:57.124 --> 15:58.250
Hey, what are you doing home
so early?

15:58.333 --> 16:00.335
- He's following me, Brian!
- Who's following you?

16:00.419 --> 16:01.628
Tom Cruise!

16:01.712 --> 16:03.213
I spend one afternoon
with the guy,

16:03.297 --> 16:05.048
and it's like I signed
an eight-year contract

16:05.132 --> 16:06.341
to show up at events with him

16:06.425 --> 16:08.010
and let him fake-father a child.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.887
Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise

16:09.970 --> 16:12.055
has better things to do
than follow you around.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.932
Oh, really?
Well, explain that!

16:21.398 --> 16:23.650
You know, it's times
like this where I think,

16:23.734 --> 16:25.944
if I didn't talk and
you were a normal baby,

16:26.028 --> 16:27.654
we wouldn't have
any of these problems.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.072
You gotta help me
get rid of him, Brian!

16:29.156 --> 16:30.657
He's creepier
than that guy at the gym

16:30.741 --> 16:32.659
who just does karate
in the mirror.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.455
It's me.
The guy's me.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.040
I'm a gym karate creep.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.127
I'm pretty good, too.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.337
But relax.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.422
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.470
Hey, Dad, what do you
say we go play catch?

16:51.553 --> 16:52.679
And throw me
some divers.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.057
I want to get grass stains
on my school slacks.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.309
What?
You're a grown man.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.520
I know, it's just so
great having a dad.

16:59.603 --> 17:02.147
Well, it's nice having
reconnected with you, too.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.650
All right, let's do it.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.282
Oh, for God's sake.

17:12.366 --> 17:14.284
See, a guy like that
should just stay inside

17:14.368 --> 17:15.702
so we don't have
to look at him.

17:15.786 --> 17:16.995
Joe, go over there

17:17.079 --> 17:18.330
and tell him to get
back in his house.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.916
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.125
Joe, you gotta go inside.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.210
You're upsetting my dad.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.087
- Your dad?
- That's right!

17:25.170 --> 17:26.588
He loves me
in a way that...

17:26.672 --> 17:28.173
Aw, you guys had pizza?

17:28.257 --> 17:29.800
Screw you, Peter!

17:29.883 --> 17:31.301
You know what? This is over!

17:31.385 --> 17:32.553
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.972
Not a chance.
I like your house better.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.849
I got nothing to hold onto
when I poop at home.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.309
You have no idea how many shower
curtains I've ripped down.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.979
- Now get inside.
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.230
Oh, yes, you are!

17:43.313 --> 17:45.941
Get away from me,
you son of a bitch!

17:46.024 --> 17:47.734
What the hell?

17:47.818 --> 17:49.403
Joe, don't take that
from him!

17:52.406 --> 17:53.740
How do you like that?

17:53.824 --> 17:56.034
You're getting
your ass kicked by a cripple!

17:56.118 --> 17:58.745
A helpless,
spaghetti-legged cripple!

17:58.829 --> 17:59.830
What are you doing?

17:59.913 --> 18:00.998
You're my son!

18:01.081 --> 18:02.165
You can't let yourself
get beat up

18:02.249 --> 18:03.834
by a guy
in a wheelchair!

18:03.917 --> 18:07.171
Your son is a guy
in a wheelchair.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.881
What are you talking about?

18:16.054 --> 18:18.182
Yes.
Yes, Dad.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.349
It's me.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.394
Joe!

18:22.477 --> 18:23.770
What the hell
happened to you?

18:23.854 --> 18:25.355
I was shot in
the line of duty.

18:25.439 --> 18:27.774
"Line of duty."

18:27.858 --> 18:30.986
So, this is why you haven't
called me in all these years?

18:31.069 --> 18:32.154
How could I, Dad?

18:32.237 --> 18:34.072
You always made fun
of handicapped people.

18:34.156 --> 18:37.701
The only thing I never
understood was... Why?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.161
I don't know.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.996
I guess I could
never stand the thought

18:41.079 --> 18:42.372
of something like that
happening to me.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.167
Or even worse, to someone
that I care about.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.294
One time, my legs fell
asleep on the toilet.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.129
I had to crawl
into the living room

18:49.213 --> 18:50.422
and interrupt
Lois' book club.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.925
That was one of the shower
curtains I ripped down.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.219
And I suppose, deep down,
I was afraid.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.012
Afraid that, if it did happen,

18:57.095 --> 18:58.805
I wouldn't be strong enough
to handle it.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.391
Well, Dad, I can tell you
from experience,

19:01.475 --> 19:04.019
it's only when
your worst fears come true

19:04.102 --> 19:07.064
that you get to find out
how strong you really are.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.816
Then I guess I've got
some learning to do.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.318
I love you, son.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.195
- I love you, too, Dad.
- I love you, too, Dad.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.243
Hey, Joe, uh,
just one question.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.537
Why do you have all those
<i>Wizard of Oz</i> plates?

19:21.620 --> 19:23.413
Because if I finish
my vegetables,

19:23.497 --> 19:25.958
I get to see
the Yellow Brick Road.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.043
All right,
you sold me.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.339
All right, Brian,

19:32.422 --> 19:34.216
Tiny Tom Cruise
is somewhere close.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.968
I can sense
his manic energy.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.135
You remember the plan?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.887
Yup, I got it.

19:38.971 --> 19:41.723
Help, help!
My dog got off his leash!

19:41.807 --> 19:44.309
Is there anyone
who can do a pumpy-arm run?

19:45.853 --> 19:48.647
Running, running, running,
running, running, running, run!

19:48.730 --> 19:51.233
Hey, Stewie. I'm here to help
you for the next billion years.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.526
All right, good to know.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.111
Anyway, my dog ran
around those bushes.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.195
I am on it!

19:56.530 --> 19:58.448
Gotcha!

19:58.532 --> 20:00.325
All right,
off to Zappos with him.

20:00.409 --> 20:01.743
You sure this
is gonna work?

20:01.827 --> 20:03.287
Oh, yeah.
They'll accept any returns.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.247
We don't even
have to pay postage.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.251
Hello, friend.
Your life...

20:09.334 --> 20:10.919
Is about to change.

20:11.003 --> 20:13.881
Hey, Tom. It's been
a couple weeks.

20:18.302 --> 20:21.263
Hey, listen, Joe, I'm sorry
I treated you like such a jerk.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.764
Well, that's okay, Peter.

20:22.848 --> 20:25.684
In fact, I got to say, it
was a nice thing you did.

20:25.767 --> 20:29.188
I'm glad I reconnected with
my dad after all these years.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.689
Ah, it was my pleasure.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.608
There's no more important
relationship than...

20:32.691 --> 20:34.026
I'm sorry, Cleveland,
what the hell

20:34.109 --> 20:35.694
is that
Toronto Raptors hat?

20:35.777 --> 20:37.112
It was my
Father's Day present.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.322
I hate it.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.948
I'm just gonna
wear it for a week,

20:40.032 --> 20:41.366
then say
I lost it.

20:41.450 --> 20:43.118
Anyway, thanks for
helping me, Peter.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.120
Yeah, it all
worked out great, Joe.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.915
Except I am still missing
that one pair of pants.

20:55.422 --> 20:59.259
Excuse me,
are those Bugle Boy jeans?
