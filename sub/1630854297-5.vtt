WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:07.475
ELIZABETH:
Well, you were right, Henry.

00:07.575 --> 00:08.776
It's as good as advertised.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.344
Yeah, Danny did
the detective work.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.214
It turns out,
they get their meat

00:13.314 --> 00:15.249
from the same people as Lugers.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.785
No kidding, and it
was half the price.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.387
(laughter)

00:19.487 --> 00:22.290
So, the same time,
same place next week?

00:22.390 --> 00:23.924
WOMAN:
Henry!

00:26.360 --> 00:27.761
Do I know you?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.730
Is it true the Police
Commissioner's Investigative

00:29.830 --> 00:33.134
Squad is nicknamed
the Broken Toys?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.235
I don't know.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.204
Why not? It's a unit
you created.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.805
Say, what is this? Who are you?

00:37.905 --> 00:39.607
Aren't they called that because
they're a group of rogue cops

00:39.707 --> 00:41.942
who do whatever they want,
however they want?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.078
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Your son

00:44.178 --> 00:46.080
can change the name, but it's
the same police state tactic.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.216
All right, out of our way,
I'm going to my car.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.250
Not until you answer us.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.551
Leave us alone.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.453
We're not leaving
until you do, right?!

00:52.553 --> 00:54.288
PROTESTERS:
Right!

00:54.388 --> 00:56.724
(shouting, clamoring)

01:00.294 --> 01:02.530
There's a woman waiting
for you in your office.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.232
Does this woman
have a name?

01:04.332 --> 01:05.733
Not one that
she'd give me.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.135
And you let her in
anyway?

01:07.235 --> 01:09.036
She gave me this.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.105
(indistinct chatter)

01:12.240 --> 01:14.775
Thank you, Annie.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.481
Abigail,
what are you doing here?

01:21.649 --> 01:24.285
Erin,
mind closing the door?

01:24.385 --> 01:26.687
Yeah, did my father send you?

01:26.787 --> 01:27.555
No.

01:27.655 --> 01:28.722
Does he know you're here?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.624
Didn't want to bother him
with this.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.694
You don't strike me as someone
to skip work lightly.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.597
Haven't taken a day
since I was assaulted.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.938
Is that what this is about?

01:45.038 --> 01:46.907
The Harris Meadows case?

01:50.811 --> 01:53.747
He beat me to a pulp.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.150
And now your office is
in the middle

01:56.250 --> 01:58.286
of cutting a deal with him.

01:59.287 --> 02:02.122
He's going to be
a cooperator for this office.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.293
He overheard
his former cellmate

02:05.393 --> 02:07.595
Pietr Papatonis,
the Greek mobster,

02:07.695 --> 02:09.630
confess to murder.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.532
So you're going
to offer him probation?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.768
Yes, Harris claims he knows

02:14.868 --> 02:16.904
where Papa buried the body.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.606
If it's true,
he will get a deal.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.441
It's as simple as that.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.412
What if we find
the body ourselves?

02:24.512 --> 02:25.713
Then you won't have to release

02:25.813 --> 02:27.114
one dangerous criminal
for another.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.683
I am not going to jeopardize
a murder case.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.620
Won't you at least try
to find another way?

02:32.720 --> 02:35.289
I'm-I'm sorry,
it's just not gonna happen.

02:35.389 --> 02:38.492
You know Harris didn't
assault just me, right?

02:38.592 --> 02:42.129
He assaulted
five other women as well.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.801
I understand that this is
personal for you.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.603
And I'm...

02:49.703 --> 02:50.938
If there's anything I can do...

02:51.038 --> 02:52.706
There's plenty
you can do.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.642
You just care more
about the headlines

02:54.742 --> 02:57.110
than you do the victims.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.251
(indistinct chatter)

03:03.351 --> 03:05.152
Janko, you're late.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.920
I'm sorry, Captain,
I got a flat tire...

03:07.020 --> 03:09.890
Save it. I've got
an abduction in sector D.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.226
And I want all hands
on deck on this one.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.594
What happened?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.529
22-year-old woman didn't
show up for work today.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.930
Her sister went
to her apartment.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.932
Found signs of a struggle.
Any suspects?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.701
We're thinking
it's the boyfriend.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.270
He also hasn't been seen
since last night.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.637
I'll catch you up
on the ride over.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.205
We're riding
together?

03:25.306 --> 03:27.575
Yeah, Walsh called in sick.
You're filling in as my driver.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.443
What about Badillo?

03:29.543 --> 03:30.778
He's reassigned
with Fergus for the day.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.280
Do you have
a problem with it?

03:32.380 --> 03:34.548
No, I just was surprised you
picked me. I didn't think...

03:34.648 --> 03:36.417
Well, you are
a demon behind the wheel.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.819
But if you'd rather, we can sit
around playing 20 questions.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.589
No, no, I'm good.
Oh, good. Suit up.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.427
Well, if it isn't
my old friend Bugs.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.796
Ah, Detective Reagan!

03:48.896 --> 03:51.098
Where's your partner, partner,
Detective Delicious?

03:51.198 --> 03:54.302
That's Detective Baez,
and she's in court.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.003
Well, that's too bad
'cause I got a two-for-one

03:56.103 --> 03:57.938
on these small boys
right here or-- hear me out.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.508
His and her matching ponchos.
Ponchos, huh?

04:00.608 --> 04:03.711
You do realize the forecast
calls for sunshine, right?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.413
You see any sun out here?
No.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.114
You see anybody selling
umbrellas out here?
No.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.082
Exactly, you got to think
outside the box

04:09.182 --> 04:10.951
in order to get around
the competition.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.720
That's shapes.
Hey, what-what are you doing?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.921
Seeing what else
you got for sale.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.289
Oh, nothing
but parasols.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.157
None of that good booger
sugar on you today?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.560
Oh, no, Lord, only, you know,
I'm 100% too legit to quit.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.863
Uh-huh. So what the hell did you
call me down here for, Bugs?

04:22.963 --> 04:25.766
I need your help actually.
With what?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.235
There's a murder
about to go down.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.971
The Dead Twins are moving in
on a rival gang member.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.740
And how do you
know about it?

04:32.840 --> 04:33.807
(clucks tongue, sighs)

04:33.907 --> 04:35.142
'Cause they want me to do it.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.411
They want you to kill
a rival gang member?

04:37.511 --> 04:39.613
That's the skinny.
Look, if you called me down here

04:39.713 --> 04:40.914
to bust my chops, Bugs...

04:41.014 --> 04:43.617
My brother owes
the Twins a favor, but he's

04:43.717 --> 04:45.819
in jail, so they figure
they'd put it on me.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.421
I can't do something like that.
I'm no killer.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.658
Umbrellas!
No, you're not,
you're an entrepreneur.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.393
Absolutely, so I need
to do something fast,

04:52.493 --> 04:54.962
or they're gonna kill him
on the inside, so please,

04:55.062 --> 04:57.798
please help me.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.769
(tapping desk)

05:01.869 --> 05:03.303
And what are we gonna do
about it?

05:03.404 --> 05:06.039
Not much we can do.
It's perfectly legal.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.676
Mobbing someone
on the sidewalk is legal?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.911
As long as nobody laid
hands on him, it's okay.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.014
No, it's not okay.
I meant legally permissible.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.250
So, legally, my dad is
just a sitting duck.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.119
An ex-NYPD commish?

05:19.219 --> 05:21.689
That ain't right.
I didn't say it was right.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.156
Yeah, I know. Just legal.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.425
It's the new tactic.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.193
Organizers offering a reward

05:26.293 --> 05:28.429
for the whereabouts of
whoever they're targeting

05:28.529 --> 05:29.963
and then flash-mobbing them.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.933
Even to senators, cabinet
members, Supreme Court nominees.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.403
Well, my 88-year-old father

05:35.503 --> 05:37.938
is retired from public service.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.008
Any truth to their claims?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.943
The Police Commissioner's
Investigative Squad

05:43.043 --> 05:45.513
has had a couple cases
of excessive force.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.482
But they were handled publicly
and without incident.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.384
And stop calling 'em that.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.485
It's what we call them.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.320
Among cops the unit has always

05:53.421 --> 05:55.956
been known as the Broken Toys
for a reason.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.526
Sharp detectives with no spouse

05:58.626 --> 06:00.127
just married to the job.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.430
But Police Commissioner's
Investigative Squad

06:02.530 --> 06:03.831
is way less provocative.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.233
But 12 Independent Contractors

06:06.333 --> 06:08.836
is not as effective
as The Dirty Dozen.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.438
Define "effective."

06:10.538 --> 06:14.007
We will never just be
the New York Polite Department.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.578
Fine-tooth comb on the Toys.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.680
If anyone roughed up a CI

06:19.780 --> 06:21.449
or even as much as spit
on the sidewalk,

06:21.549 --> 06:22.683
I want to know about it.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.984
Copy that, boss.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.220
And who's organizing
these ambushes?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.822
Name's Connor Kelly.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.124
Top-drawer
corporate litigator who...

06:31.224 --> 06:33.961
takes on issues like these
as his way to "give back."

06:34.061 --> 06:35.429
Invite him up here.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.130
He won't come.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.700
(tapping desk)

06:42.102 --> 06:45.005
By invite him up here, I mean
send a couple of detectives

06:45.105 --> 06:47.407
to visit him in person

06:47.508 --> 06:48.942
and suggest strongly...

06:49.042 --> 06:50.444
You're getting close
to the edge here, Frank.

06:50.544 --> 06:53.814
...suggest strongly with
carefully applied pressure.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.451
You think he's
the only one who gets

06:57.551 --> 06:58.986
to use the element of surprise?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.822
No. Didn't think so.

07:04.858 --> 07:08.095
* *

07:28.148 --> 07:30.383
(indistinct chatter)

07:31.552 --> 07:34.254
McNICHOLS:
Detective Hannigan.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.724
Captain McNichols.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.326
(chuckles) What are you,
what are you doing here?

07:39.426 --> 07:41.128
Just checking in on things.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.630
Well, as you can see,

07:42.730 --> 07:44.865
it's-- we've got it
all under control.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.367
Well, I have my officers
looking out for anything

07:47.467 --> 07:49.069
that might help.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.971
That all?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.606
Anything in particular

07:52.706 --> 07:54.374
you need 'em
to keep an eye out for?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.110
I think, uh, we've got this one
in the bag. (chuckles)

07:57.210 --> 07:58.679
Is that so?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.881
Yeah, we located
the victim's boyfriend Arthur.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.950
I'll put him through hell
in the box and...

08:03.050 --> 08:05.118
we should have Jackie home
in no time.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.120
You're sure it's him?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.524
Uh, Arthur and Jackie got
in a big fight

08:10.624 --> 08:13.093
last night at a bar,
made a scene.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.695
This morning
we find Arthur

08:14.795 --> 08:17.197
hiding out at his best friend's
house. (clicks tongue)

08:17.297 --> 08:18.465
That sounds promising.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.067
OFFICER:
Ma'am, you can't go in there.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.435
Ah, geez, not again.

08:22.536 --> 08:23.671
(sighs)

08:23.771 --> 08:24.738
JANKO:
Who's that?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.741
It's, uh, victim's
twin sister.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.376
She keeps trying to record
the crime scene.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.344
What? Why?
She's an influencer.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.446
She's wants
to crowdsource

08:33.547 --> 08:34.815
Jackie's rescue.
(stammers)

08:34.915 --> 08:36.316
Listen,
I'm a little busy right now.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.752
Captain, if you really want
to help, you can maybe, uh,

08:38.852 --> 08:41.154
assist with canvassing
or something like that.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.489
Excuse me.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.195
Um, I don't think he would have
dismissed Espinoza like that.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.430
Some people are still
getting used to me

08:50.530 --> 08:52.299
being C.O. of
the precincts,

08:52.399 --> 08:54.134
so it takes time.
It shouldn't.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.036
He should show
you respect.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.905
It's his crime scene,
it's his case.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.473
We help out
where we can.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.612
(elevator bell dings)

09:07.314 --> 09:08.749
Hey, we got
a problem.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.550
Uh, there's a plunger
in the supply closet.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.119
Different problem.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.922
You know how Papatonis has
his construction company?

09:15.022 --> 09:16.556
Of course, that's where
he hides all his assets.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.191
Yeah, well, I got
detectives sitting

09:18.291 --> 09:20.894
on all those building sites.
One of 'em just called me

09:20.994 --> 09:23.563
and said that some woman
came around asking questions.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.098
Oh, no.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.667
A Detective, uh,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.401
Abigail Baker.
Yeah.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.837
What, you already knew?

09:29.937 --> 09:32.072
She came by earlier.
What? Why?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.642
I'll explain later.
What happened with Baker?

09:34.742 --> 09:37.010
She almost ran into Papa
at the construction site.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.712
Missed each other
by minutes.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.748
Well, she could've blown
the whole operation.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.116
We're lucky he's not already
on a flight out of here.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.952
Get her in here.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.454
Do you know the name of the guy
the Twins want you to take out?

09:47.554 --> 09:50.257
Uh, Hector, he's a member
of the Mara Noche.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.592
Uh, you know where we
can find this Hector?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.762
Nope.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.264
These stay out here.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.733
All right, I'm keeping mine.
I'm gonna keep this one.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.768
I'm taking my one.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.604
Do you have any proof that they
asked you to kill this guy?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.106
Proof? Like what?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.841
You know, text message,
a recording,

10:07.941 --> 10:09.442
anything?
No, I ain't got none of that.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.411
Okay, well, then you're gonna
have to help me get it.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.380
I am?
Look, all you got to do

10:13.480 --> 10:15.683
is set up another meeting
with the Twins, only this time

10:15.783 --> 10:16.850
you'll wear a listening device.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.285
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:18.385 --> 10:19.953
You want me to go undercover?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.055
You want to see me get shot
again. That's a terrible idea.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.191
I never wanted to see you get
shot in the first place.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.726
Okay, look, relax.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.294
You want to save
your brother or not?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.898
Okay, then let's get you
wired up.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.633
You want to explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

10:33.734 --> 10:36.269
Investigating, since this
office clearly won't.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.105
Okay, well,
first off all,

10:38.205 --> 10:39.639
this is not your case.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.442
And we have
our own investigators here.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.377
Secondly, there is
nothing to investigate

10:44.477 --> 10:45.846
because we already have Papa,

10:45.946 --> 10:47.347
unless, of course,
you already tipped him off.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.216
You were moments away
from running into him.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.184
I knew exactly
when he was showing up.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.754
We are a couple days
away from finalizing

10:53.854 --> 10:55.088
this deal with Harris's lawyer.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.857
Great, so I have a couple days.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.793
Are you even listening
to a word I'm saying?

10:59.893 --> 11:01.328
If Papatonis buried a body,

11:01.428 --> 11:03.296
there was a good chance
it was on one

11:03.396 --> 11:05.265
of his construction sites,
and somebody

11:05.365 --> 11:06.599
working for him knows which.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.068
We've been trying
to get Papa for months.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.170
And you think you can
just waltz in here

11:10.270 --> 11:12.305
and crack the case in a day,
really?

11:12.405 --> 11:13.540
I'm sure as hell gonna try.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.075
No, you are not.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.477
You know what the last thing
Harris said to me was?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.012
When he got out,

11:19.112 --> 11:20.948
he would find me and my family.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.150
We won't let him hurt you.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.551
Who won't?

11:24.651 --> 11:26.219
The two of you?

11:35.628 --> 11:38.065
He's here, boss.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.202
Let's have him.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.304
(tapping desk)

11:44.404 --> 11:46.940
I'll see him alone.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.715
We're walking a fine line here.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.285
Be careful, boss.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.055
(door closes)

12:06.827 --> 12:08.728
Connor Kelly, sir.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.331
Accepting your invitation.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.805
Mr. Kelly,
I guess you've already met

12:17.905 --> 12:20.140
Detective Nuciforo.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.244
At my office.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.780
Have a seat.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.383
Down here?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.820
Yes, that's your seat.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.090
Or you can stand if you want.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.099
(door closes)

12:47.267 --> 12:50.403
You need to stop sending mobs

12:50.503 --> 12:53.040
to harass my senior citizens.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.642
I haven't sent anyone anywhere.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.777
They come bearing your standard.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.779
Not my standard.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.515
We just share the same...

13:02.615 --> 13:04.484
deep concerns.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.219
But the fact that we're talking
at all is a testament

13:06.319 --> 13:08.889
to the effectiveness
of these protests.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.658
No, it's a testament
to how pissed off I am

13:11.758 --> 13:13.526
by you bullying my old man.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.962
Cut it out.

13:15.062 --> 13:18.398
I'll make a statement
condemning the tactics

13:18.498 --> 13:20.200
as soon as you...

13:20.300 --> 13:23.336
disband what you call
the Broken Toys.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.275
And there it is.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.378
Not gonna happen.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.281
They're a band of cowboys
who are harming and harassing

13:34.381 --> 13:37.117
innocent families
from low-income communities.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.287
You got proof of that?
I grew up with it.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.858
I saw them firsthand
in our building,

13:44.958 --> 13:47.194
in our neighborhood.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.930
Unrestrained.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.199
Unaccountable.

13:52.299 --> 13:55.735
Your father founded it
and you brought it back.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.070
Why?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.408
I missed them.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.144
And they were needed.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.080
The same way you miss the rest
of last-century thinking?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.249
I know what year it is.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.384
I also know the criminal class

14:11.484 --> 14:14.321
didn't keep up with
your idea of moral progress.

14:14.421 --> 14:18.425
Who died and gave you the
final say on urban policing?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.027
No one.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.462
But when I clerked for
Supreme Court Justice O'Connor,

14:22.562 --> 14:24.998
we handled several
systemic abuse of force cases.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.034
A lot like this one.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.003
So now it's systemic?

14:30.103 --> 14:32.005
I thought it was just one unit

14:32.105 --> 14:34.807
that had you clutching
your pearls.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.478
Tell me something.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.547
What's your angle here?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.383
You gearing up to run
for political office?

14:43.483 --> 14:47.520
A proud but concerned
New Yorker.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.523
That's all.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.226
Tell your people to back off.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.029
Or what?

14:56.129 --> 14:59.066
You'll send
some Broken Toys after me?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.078
Look, when you're done
with that, holler at me.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.280
All right? Appreciate you.
Safety.
Yeah.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.647
Soul Glo, right?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.517
Brother Jay, Brother Jay,
what's going on, man?

15:17.617 --> 15:18.986
What the hell
you want, Bugs?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.254
You already know what you got
to do if you don't want

15:21.354 --> 15:22.655
your brother
to have an accident.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.291
Well, see, the thing is,
I'm a little fuzzy

15:24.391 --> 15:26.526
up here with some
of the details.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.661
Your boss wants you to take out

15:28.761 --> 15:30.563
Hector of the Mara Noche.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.065
Boss know where
I can find this guy?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.633
You want us to pull
the trigger for you, too?

15:33.733 --> 15:34.701
Okay, come on, Jay,
it's my brother.

15:34.801 --> 15:35.902
Just help me out a little bit.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.038
Fine.

15:39.139 --> 15:42.175
Hector walks his dog
on Lefferts Avenue.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.876
Uh-huh.
Every evening.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.212
And, Bugs?
Hmm?

15:45.312 --> 15:47.314
You only got 48 hours
to get it done.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.149
48 hours?! You said
I had two weeks.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.418
Yeah, boss pulled up the
timeline. Hey, yo, we clear?

15:51.518 --> 15:53.120
We clear, we clear.
You know what?

15:53.220 --> 15:55.588
I'm wr-- You right, I'm wrong.
I'm about to get out of here.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.624
Got a lot to do. Huh?
Wait.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.292
Yo, you feeling all right?
You moving a little more

15:59.392 --> 16:00.927
fidgety than usual.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.329
Oh, 'cause of my...

16:02.429 --> 16:04.764
I had some bad coke, you
know, they might've cut it

16:04.864 --> 16:06.199
with a little fenty, so
I'm a little... (exhales)

16:06.299 --> 16:08.901
Yeah, right, hold on.
What's that you doing?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.803
What-What's going on?
Special little app I got.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.673
Special app?
Checks for those
Bluetooth listening devices

16:13.773 --> 16:15.208
cops use these days.
You know, I heard of that app.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.544
(clearing throat noisily)

16:17.644 --> 16:19.146
JAY: Bad coke, right?
Yeah, it's just bad coke.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.980
He's gonna be made.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.716
What the hell are you doing?
I'm going out there.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.854
Regular Reggie gave it to me.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.689
I can get you some if you need
some, if that's what you into.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.158
No, that's not even necessary.
You just stay right there.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.726
Stay right here? All right...
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.895
Sorry I'm late. Hey!
Who the hell is you?!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.364
Whoa, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

16:37.464 --> 16:38.731
Who is you?
Come on, little...
Jon.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.200
Brother Jay...
You didn't tell him about me?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.568
Jon?
I know his brother
from the joint.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.869
He asked me to
come help out.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.671
Yeah, nah, that wasn't
part of the deal.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.306
No, no, no, he helped him out...
Oh, hey... he didn't think

16:46.406 --> 16:47.974
he could handle it by himself.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.809
He asked me to help out, that's
why I'm here, to help out.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.378
And I just wanted to make sure
y'all got what y'all want.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.080
Will you shut up?
Shut up, man!

16:54.047 --> 16:55.915
Did this before, ain't you?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.351
Yeah.
Yeah, I can always
tell a killer.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.819
So what's the deal?

16:59.919 --> 17:01.954
I need proof that it's done.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.623
You got 48 hours.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.326
What proof?
I don't know. Figure it out.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.862
It's not just Bugs with this
debt now. Now it's on you, too.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.066
Okay.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.168
(indistinct chatter)

17:16.203 --> 17:17.770
Forget about it,
it's not enough.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.606
What you mean it's not enough?
We got everything we needed.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.608
Right? Jay spilled
all the Cheerios,

17:21.708 --> 17:23.576
so now you just go
and arrest him, right?

17:23.676 --> 17:25.278
We're not arresting
anyone yet.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.746
What the hell, man?

17:26.846 --> 17:28.548
They're gonna kill
my brother on the inside.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.183
Because there are
bigger fish out there.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.951
You're gonna let them kill
my brother over some fish?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.986
Not fish.
Jay's boss.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.655
Well, how you gonna get him,
hmm?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.824
We will discreetly collar
Hector Guerrero

17:37.924 --> 17:39.459
on an outstanding warrant.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.994
His guys won't know if he's
floating in the East River

17:42.095 --> 17:44.731
or locked up. We'll use that to
arrange a meeting with the boss.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.699
But you heard Jay,
we need proof.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.401
How you gonna get that?

17:48.501 --> 17:49.736
Leave that part to me, okay?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.438
So let me get this straight,
you're gonna do

17:51.538 --> 17:52.972
all this In 48 hours?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.675
Yes, and all you need to do
is keep your mouth shut.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.044
Do you think
you can manage that much?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.052
(indistinct chatter)

18:07.854 --> 18:10.690
You're not listening
at all.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.328
E-Excuse me?

18:15.428 --> 18:17.264
Morgan?
Yes?

18:17.364 --> 18:20.467
I'm-I'm really sorry about
what happened to your sister.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.001
And I just want
to let you know

18:22.101 --> 18:23.803
we're doing everything
we can to find her.

18:23.903 --> 18:27.039
Yeah, seems like you guys
are doing a great job.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.808
Do you, do you mind if I just...
(exhales)

18:28.908 --> 18:31.278
...ask you a couple questions?

18:32.879 --> 18:34.847
Sure.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.683
Um...

18:36.783 --> 18:39.286
how well do you know your
sister's boyfriend Arthur?

18:39.386 --> 18:40.887
Arthur didn't do this, okay?

18:40.987 --> 18:42.855
There's no way.
I keep telling that guy.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.591
Mm.
He loves her.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.293
And, besides,
he's a total softy.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.127
Do you know anyone
that would want to hurt her?

18:48.228 --> 18:50.297
If you met Jackie,
you wouldn't ask that question.

18:50.397 --> 18:53.366
She's an angel,
always helping people.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.635
It's almost annoying sometimes.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.505
So, the-the night
she went missing,

18:58.605 --> 19:01.608
you guys left the bar together?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.410
She walked me home.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.278
Like always.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.580
I should have done it for her.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.349
This is not your fault.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.653
I hear you're like
a big social media star.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.388
Your-your sister--

19:15.488 --> 19:17.357
she into that stuff, too, or...?

19:17.457 --> 19:18.758
No.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.261
She deleted all her accounts
about a year ago.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.062
Why?
I think she saw

19:23.162 --> 19:25.598
what it was like for me
and wanted no part of it.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.866
What's it like for you?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.535
Well, let's just say

19:28.635 --> 19:30.337
there are a lot of creeps

19:30.437 --> 19:32.205
and perverts on there.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.674
You should see
some of the messages I get.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.210
Can I?

19:38.378 --> 19:41.614
I don't see what it has
to do with Jackie, but sure.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.787
Oh, my God.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.422
Wait, well,
some of these guys have

19:49.522 --> 19:51.291
your actual location on here.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.992
I know, freaky, right?

19:53.092 --> 19:56.229
Would it be okay if I sent
myself some screenshots?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.864
Go ahead.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.404
Hey.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.540
Just got off the phone
with Harris's lawyers.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.875
We're all set.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.743
We're free to move forward.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.280
You sound
like your cat just died.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.849
You think we're doing
the right thing

20:16.949 --> 20:18.518
by giving Harris probation?

20:18.618 --> 20:20.720
I feel for Baker, too.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.690
But this is murder.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.891
I know.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.261
And Papa's a huge flight risk.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.862
Yeah.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.998
And this could be
our last shot.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.800
Exactly.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.868
Look, I love having my cake
and eating it, too,

20:35.968 --> 20:38.771
but the stakes are
high on this one.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.073
I completely agree.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.712
Then why do I still
see those wheels

20:45.812 --> 20:47.847
turning in the
wrong direction?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.683
Baker's logic is sound.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.819
She's got a point.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.355
If we find the body,
we don't need Harris.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.956
And it makes sense that the body

20:57.056 --> 20:58.958
could be buried
in one of Papa's buildings.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.027
You sound like you're trying
to convince yourself.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.930
See what you can find in a day.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.466
If you don't come up
with any leads,

21:06.566 --> 21:08.968
then we'll move forward
with the Harris deal.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.470
You sure about this?

21:10.570 --> 21:12.805
Just do it.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.575
Huh? Baker's still out?

21:15.675 --> 21:18.645
Bet it was the raw bar at the
first responders' charity.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.547
Whew! Nearly
brought me down.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.515
Boy.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.517
Sounds pretty serious.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.918
Maybe I should call her.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.420
Oh, I already did, boss.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.721
She's on the mend.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.990
Oh.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.693
Okay.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.194
What do we got?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.397
Sid found complaints
that have flown under the radar,

21:37.497 --> 21:38.931
but nothing major.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.199
What kind of complaints?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.602
Low-level stuff.
Cuffing a perp too tight,

21:42.702 --> 21:45.638
foul language, you know,
complaints we've all gotten.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.840
Anything that would give
Kelly ammunition?

21:47.940 --> 21:50.577
No way. Cursing is
a far cry from roughing up

21:50.677 --> 21:53.680
an innocent civilian.
Yeah, but it still
begs the question,

21:53.780 --> 21:56.783
is there anything still out
there they might be hiding?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.951
And Kelly's smart,
and there's enough evidence

21:59.051 --> 22:00.853
of sharp elbows
for him to latch onto.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.157
Nobody goes after my family
to get to me.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.993
Nobody.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.430
Frank, maybe it's best
to give in on this.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.864
You want to get rid

22:11.964 --> 22:13.032
of an effective police tool

22:13.132 --> 22:14.233
for no good reason?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.436
It may be effective,
but at what cost?

22:16.536 --> 22:19.105
Times have changed
since Henry's day.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.541
Maybe it's time
to put this one to bed.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.544
He does that, Kelly'll be back
next week with another demand.

22:24.644 --> 22:28.481
Maybe, but it might take the
venom out of these protests.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.519
Appeasement's
not an option if you care

22:32.619 --> 22:35.154
about the lives of the innocent.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.724
What do we tell the public

22:37.824 --> 22:39.459
when they're being robbed
at gunpoint?

22:39.559 --> 22:41.461
Fight 'em for their gun?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.996
Or give 'em your wallet?

22:45.965 --> 22:48.300
Maybe we should take
our own advice on this.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.442
(sighs)

23:09.756 --> 23:11.491
Why'd you call me here?

23:11.591 --> 23:13.225
Keeping tabs on me?

23:13.325 --> 23:14.827
Gonna slap a GPS
on my car?

23:14.927 --> 23:16.663
If I wanted to do that,
I would've just called you up

23:16.763 --> 23:18.431
to the D.A.'s office.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.866
So why am I here?

23:19.966 --> 23:21.434
You're not gonna stop
me from investigating.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.903
You're right. Gonna help you.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.205
You serious?

23:26.305 --> 23:27.674
We got 24 hours
to make this case

23:27.774 --> 23:29.942
if we want to keep
your assailant behind bars.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.678
Why the change of heart?

23:31.778 --> 23:34.413
Truthfully,
I'm as confused as you are.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.082
This was Erin's call?

23:36.182 --> 23:37.884
Yeah, but I'm glad she made it.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.587
If you're gonna do this, you
shouldn't have to do it alone.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.589
Be good to have you on board.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.624
Erin said she'll get us
a search warrant,

23:44.724 --> 23:47.259
but we need to get a credible
source to tell us exactly

23:47.359 --> 23:49.028
where that body is buried.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.897
Great, already done.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.264
What?

23:52.364 --> 23:55.267
I talked to Papa's old
business partner Rico.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.836
He confirmed there's a body.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.938
Even said he helped
pour the concrete.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.507
Rico?
Mm-hmm.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.141
I already interrogated that guy.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.409
He's like a locked box.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.644
How the hell did you get him
to talk?

24:04.744 --> 24:07.680
He didn't just talk, he sang.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.950
And you don't want
to know the how.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.720
You do work for
the D.A.'s office, after all.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.187
Okay.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.123
So where's the body?

24:17.223 --> 24:20.026
Papa did a special addition

24:20.126 --> 24:22.895
to his mother's house
around the time of the murder.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.331
That's where we'll
find it. So...

24:25.431 --> 24:27.199
the warrant?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.536
I'll make the call.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.303
(drum banging)

24:31.403 --> 24:33.806
PROTESTERS:
Justice!

24:35.908 --> 24:37.944
Justice!

24:38.978 --> 24:40.379
Justice!

24:40.479 --> 24:42.682
(drum beating outside)

24:45.451 --> 24:47.687
Oh, damn.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.891
(sighs)

24:54.460 --> 24:55.828
(sighs)

24:55.928 --> 24:59.165
Hard to concentrate
with all that racket.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.574
So, how are you holding up?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.909
I'm okay.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.614
So you had another

25:14.714 --> 25:16.716
go-round with them
this afternoon?

25:16.816 --> 25:19.018
I can't even leave
the house anymore.

25:19.118 --> 25:22.454
How the hell do they know
where I am all the time?

25:22.555 --> 25:24.423
The organizers offer money

25:24.523 --> 25:26.492
to reveal our location.

25:26.593 --> 25:29.328
It's like I got
a bounty on my head.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.497
What a world, huh?

25:31.598 --> 25:34.433
(chuckles)
All this because

25:34.533 --> 25:36.268
you brought back...

25:36.368 --> 25:38.537
the Broken Toys?

25:39.639 --> 25:41.540
Turns out I brought 'em back

25:41.641 --> 25:43.542
into a whole different time.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.411
You found any...

25:45.511 --> 25:47.379
real evidence of wrongdoing?

25:47.479 --> 25:49.381
Not the way you and I
would define it.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.083
(chuckles)

25:51.183 --> 25:54.854
Cops just aren't allowed
to swagger anymore.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.158
When I created this unit...

25:59.258 --> 26:00.660
(stammers)

26:00.760 --> 26:03.663
I kind of felt
that I was one of them.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.165
I mean, they did things
in an unconventional way,

26:06.265 --> 26:07.800
but they got the job done.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.303
Yeah, I always thought
Danny'd fit right in.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.272
(laughs)

26:13.372 --> 26:15.274
A match made.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.178
But if their time's passed,

26:19.278 --> 26:21.013
their time's passed.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.149
Pop.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.486
You don't really want me
to disband this unit.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.455
A few years ago,
I would have said

26:29.555 --> 26:32.091
no way are we giving in.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.860
A few years ago,

26:33.960 --> 26:35.695
I would've fought back

26:35.795 --> 26:38.798
against those idiots
outside the restaurant.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.168
But I...

26:42.268 --> 26:44.937
I can't fight...

26:45.037 --> 26:48.540
I can't fight
those battles anymore.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.478
You shouldn't have to.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.947
(sighs)

26:55.047 --> 26:57.616
But I can.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.820
Want the truth, Francis?

27:03.322 --> 27:07.226
Outside the restaurant,
I was scared.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.206
Ponchos, queen, poncho, no?

27:20.306 --> 27:21.874
Poncho, keep you dry...

27:21.974 --> 27:23.509
Business a little slow today,
Bugs?

27:23.609 --> 27:25.377
(laughs)

27:25.477 --> 27:26.946
Turns out, people
only want

27:27.046 --> 27:28.580
umbrellas when it's
raining outside.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.249
Mm-hmm.
If you ask me, I
don't see the point.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.383
It's already too late.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.019
Well...

27:33.119 --> 27:34.821
maybe this'll cheer you up.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.989
You got him already?
Yep.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.991
Did I ever give you
a reason to doubt me?

27:39.091 --> 27:40.592
All right,
let's not get too cocky.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.294
I really didn't think you was
gonna pull that off in 48 hours.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.462
I really didn't think so.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.663
Your brother's
gonna be okay.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.198
I give you my word.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.967
You're all right, man.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.301
What now?

27:49.401 --> 27:51.003
Now I need you to set up

27:51.103 --> 27:52.739
another meeting with the Twins.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.506
But you're gonna
tell them we only show

27:54.606 --> 27:56.675
this proof to the boss.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.077
Nobody else.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.880
Aye, aye, Captain, sir,
Captain, sir.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.414
Ponchos!

28:02.514 --> 28:03.950
Umbrellas.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.985
Get your poncho here.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.687
Hey, Janko.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.123
My office now.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.963
What's going on?

28:18.630 --> 28:21.467
Detective Hannigan and his boss
Lieutenant Greer just informed

28:21.567 --> 28:23.302
me that you interviewed

28:23.402 --> 28:24.703
one of their witnesses.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.072
I did.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.506
And what were you thinking?

28:28.340 --> 28:29.976
I was thinking
that Jackie's been missing

28:30.076 --> 28:31.944
for almost three days
and I wanted to help out.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.880
What were you gonna do
next, Janko?

28:33.980 --> 28:36.548
Steal a detective's shield,
go knocking on doors?

28:36.648 --> 28:38.384
Well, maybe you should've gone
and knocked on a few more

28:38.484 --> 28:40.519
instead of fixating on
the boyfriend this whole time.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.721
Hey, hey, hey,
no, you don't get

28:42.822 --> 28:44.857
to do whatever you want
whenever you want.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.392
There is
a command structure here,

28:46.492 --> 28:47.894
and you need to respect it.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.862
Captain, just hear me out.
I think I got a lead.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.263
Are you even listening to me?

28:51.363 --> 28:53.132
No, let her go, Captain,
this ought to be good.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.135
I found a guy
who has been stalking Morgan.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.805
He even posted
her exact location

28:58.905 --> 29:00.907
the day before Jackie
went missing, so maybe

29:01.007 --> 29:02.809
he followed them both home
from the bar

29:02.909 --> 29:04.777
and just grabbed
the wrong sister.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.412
(laughs, clears throat)

29:06.512 --> 29:07.780
I told you.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.017
I don't care
what you think you found, Janko.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.819
I'm giving you a rip.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.620
Captain, come on.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.088
You disobeyed

29:16.188 --> 29:18.024
my direct order
and you interfered

29:18.124 --> 29:19.691
in Detective Hannigan's
investigation!

29:19.792 --> 29:21.593
You are not above the rules.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.030
And you pull this one more time,

29:24.130 --> 29:26.732
and I will transfer you
to the farthest precinct

29:26.833 --> 29:29.401
that I can find.
Do you understand me?

29:30.569 --> 29:32.504
Yes, Captain.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.841
Good.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.177
(sighs)

29:43.749 --> 29:45.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:45.617 --> 29:46.819
What's all this?

29:46.919 --> 29:48.787
Pietr Papatonis.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.656
Your mother home?

29:50.756 --> 29:52.258
Yeah, I just dropped
off her dinner.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.861
What a coincidence. We were just
dropping off this warrant.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.998
No, you're not.
I'm calling my lawyer.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.933
Oh, that's cute, you
think we can't go in?

30:01.033 --> 30:02.634
Maybe he doesn't know
how warrants work.

30:02.734 --> 30:05.437
Careful, sweetheart, you don't
know who you're dealing with.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.906
Oh, I think you're the one
who doesn't know

30:07.006 --> 30:08.774
who he's dealing with,
sweetheart.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.509
She's funny.

30:10.609 --> 30:11.911
She's really not.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.312
You either show us
where you hid the body,

30:13.412 --> 30:15.214
or I'll send my team
in there and they'll

30:15.314 --> 30:17.083
take this house apart
brick by brick

30:17.183 --> 30:18.750
while your mother watches.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.286
That right?
That's right.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.854
Screw you.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.192
Tear it apart.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.794
(indistinct chatter)
(dog barking)

30:35.167 --> 30:37.136
Yo, maybe we just
get out of here.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.938
You know,
forget the whole thing.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.373
Maybe you should take it
easy and relax a little bit.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.741
I don't know, man.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.177
I do. You got to relax.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.445
Don't blow it.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.314
All right.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.484
So, I heard

30:52.584 --> 30:54.553
you guys got proof

30:54.653 --> 30:56.555
you took care of Hector.

30:56.655 --> 30:57.856
Yeah, they'll be
picking up pieces

30:57.957 --> 30:59.225
of Hector
in all five boroughs.

30:59.325 --> 31:02.061
All right, show me
what you brought.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.263
No can do, that's for

31:04.363 --> 31:06.999
your boss to see. Your boss
is the only one that can keep

31:07.099 --> 31:08.700
his brother alive.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.536
So that's who sees the proof.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.105
Yeah.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.409
Fine.

31:17.509 --> 31:20.412
Follow me.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.985
(knocking)
All right, look, boys.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.220
Look what I brought you.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.658
I think you better go, Bugs.

31:32.758 --> 31:34.560
Yeah, Bugs, I think you
should. You did your job

31:34.660 --> 31:37.563
and you did it well. Time
for you to go, you heard?

31:37.663 --> 31:39.065
What's he talking about?

31:39.165 --> 31:40.632
I'm so sorry, man.
I didn't think 48 hours

31:40.732 --> 31:42.034
was enough time.
I gave you up

31:42.134 --> 31:43.235
for my brother's protection.
I'm so sorry.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.536
You set me up?
I'm sorry, man.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.872
You set me up?!
You son of a bitch!

31:46.973 --> 31:48.840
Shut up and get lost!
Bugs, you set me up!

31:48.941 --> 31:50.076
I'm sorry, man.
You son of a bitch!

31:50.176 --> 31:51.377
You set me up!
Shut up and get lost!

31:51.477 --> 31:53.912
Danny, run!

31:55.781 --> 31:57.716
Stay back!
Stay back!

31:57.816 --> 31:59.151
Stay back!

31:59.251 --> 32:01.253
Back!

32:03.255 --> 32:04.156
Hey!

32:04.256 --> 32:07.026
Reagan!
Stay down!

32:07.793 --> 32:09.061
Backup, move in!

32:09.661 --> 32:10.496
Move in!

32:10.596 --> 32:13.032
(indistinct shouting)

32:16.135 --> 32:19.238
(sirens wailing)

32:22.541 --> 32:24.010
Police here! Police!

32:24.110 --> 32:26.645
Move, move!
Police! Get your
hands up! Hands up!

32:26.745 --> 32:29.281
(officers shouting)

32:35.587 --> 32:37.456
Get on your feet.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.160
Hey, come on,
get on your feet.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.464
You know,
you're a real piece of work.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.333
I'm sorry, man.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.335
I didn't want them to kill
my brother in jail.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.437
But I didn't want them
to kill you either.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.306
You okay?

32:54.406 --> 32:55.841
Yeah.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.376
You want me
to arrest him?

32:58.810 --> 33:01.047
No.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.815
Let him go.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.118
Go ahead.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.798
I had to do it, Eddie.
Did you?

33:19.898 --> 33:22.068
Yes. You didn't leave
me a choice.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.670
In front of Hannigan?
I mean, really?

33:24.770 --> 33:26.772
How am I supposed
to get a guy like Hannigan

33:26.872 --> 33:28.974
to respect me when it is
clear that I can't

33:29.075 --> 33:31.477
even keep my own officers
in line?

33:31.577 --> 33:33.612
All I did was talk to her.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.282
No, you undermined my authority.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.750
Worse than Hannigan's ever done.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.587
I'm sorry.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.256
And that's the last thing
I would ever want to do.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.025
Look, in this line of work,

33:47.126 --> 33:49.761
we should be allies.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.931
We shouldn't be
at each other's throats.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.834
But... I am not gonna be seen

33:55.934 --> 33:59.171
playing favorites, so do not
put me in this position again.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.074
I hear you.

34:02.174 --> 34:05.277
For real this time.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.913
Good.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.982
That creep
who was stalking Morgan,

34:11.083 --> 34:13.452
he list an address
or anything in his profile?

34:14.320 --> 34:16.522
I thought you were leaving
the case to Hannigan.

34:16.622 --> 34:20.126
Let's just call it
additional canvassing.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.839
(heavy metal playing)
(faint whimpering)

34:38.677 --> 34:41.547
(whimpering)

34:43.482 --> 34:46.084
Are you okay?
Bathroom.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.360
Police!

34:54.460 --> 34:56.562
(grunting)

34:59.431 --> 35:01.633
(both grunting)

35:12.744 --> 35:14.280
Janko, you okay?

35:14.380 --> 35:16.114
Never better.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.251
You okay?

35:19.351 --> 35:21.119
I'm okay.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.390
Can I just say it?

35:24.490 --> 35:25.857
What?

35:26.725 --> 35:28.594
You're a total badass.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.962
(both laugh)

35:31.062 --> 35:32.664
Wow.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.500
Great.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.268
Erin.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.037
Got a minute?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.407
Sure, come on in.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.877
Just wanted to thank you
for changing your mind.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.582
I'm not sure I'm the one
you should be thanking.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.818
What do you mean?

35:52.918 --> 35:54.953
It was my father's idea

35:55.053 --> 35:57.088
to give you
that 24-hour window.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.791
You told him
I came to you?
No.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.793
He figured it out on his own.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.629
I guess something
seemed off about your,

36:03.729 --> 36:05.564
uh, stomach bug.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.733
Doesn't miss much, does he?

36:07.833 --> 36:09.701
No, he does not.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.103
But do me a favor,
don't tell him I told you.

36:12.204 --> 36:15.006
Of course not.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.477
Probably time
I get back there.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.846
Hopefully they haven't burned
it down while I've been gone.

36:20.946 --> 36:23.181
Well, good luck with that.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.618
I did want to ask you,

36:26.718 --> 36:28.387
uh...

36:28.487 --> 36:30.689
Anthony told me
that it was you that got Rico

36:30.789 --> 36:32.724
to give up where that body was.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.326
How did you do that?

36:34.426 --> 36:36.895
Well, I told him
that the D.A.'s office

36:36.995 --> 36:39.465
would give him a deal
if he ratted.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.268
Let him skate on those fraud
charges he has pending.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.304
That's what you guys
do here, right?

36:46.137 --> 36:48.874
I suppose
we could accommodate that.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.209
I thought you could.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.783
(door opens)

36:59.551 --> 37:01.787
(indistinct chatter)

37:03.221 --> 37:04.923
Connor Kelly?

37:05.023 --> 37:06.224
Yes, can I help you?

37:06.325 --> 37:08.527
My son was murdered.
And my husband!

37:08.627 --> 37:10.095
And my daughter.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.997
Commissioner Reagan's team
solved all of their cases.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.999
They brought us justice!
Yeah, look, I'm having lunch.

37:14.099 --> 37:15.801
I would be happy to talk
to you another time.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.103
Now is a good time for us.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.472
Make some noise,
protect the Toys!

37:20.572 --> 37:22.974
OTHERS (chanting):
Make some noise, protect
the Toys!

37:23.074 --> 37:25.176
Your concerns,
I appreciate them...

37:25.277 --> 37:27.779
Make some noise,
protect the Toys!

37:27.879 --> 37:30.081
Make some noise, protect
the Toys!

37:30.181 --> 37:32.818
Make some noise,
protect the Toys!

37:37.423 --> 37:39.325
Morning, Baker.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.127
Good morning, boss.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.565
All better?

37:46.665 --> 37:49.167
Much better.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.971
Good.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.941
What the hell did you do?

37:56.942 --> 37:58.544
And good morning to you, too.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.713
Sid said someone reached out
to the victims' families

38:01.813 --> 38:04.683
of the cases the PCIS
have closed.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.385
The who closed?

38:06.485 --> 38:07.753
Oh, the Broken Toys.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.421
Thank you.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.957
Here's what I think.
I think you called the families

38:12.057 --> 38:13.725
of more than a dozen of them

38:13.825 --> 38:15.394
and didn't tell me.

38:15.494 --> 38:19.431
Well, it hasn't been an easy
week for them either, Garrett.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.533
And just between you and me,

38:21.633 --> 38:23.101
I might have, oh,

38:23.201 --> 38:25.971
accidentally called them
to say hi.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.507
So you just called
to check up on them?

38:28.607 --> 38:30.241
And here's what I think.

38:30.342 --> 38:32.978
Whatever sharp elbows
the Toys might have used,

38:33.078 --> 38:35.313
the only thing they deserve

38:35.414 --> 38:37.916
is a thank you.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.421
And who knows?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.690
Maybe, just maybe,

38:44.790 --> 38:46.958
those parents and siblings

38:47.058 --> 38:49.895
just might pay
Mr. Kelly a visit.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.863
You can't do that.

38:51.963 --> 38:54.400
Why not? You said
it's perfectly legal.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.901
It is.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.470
What, legal for them
but not for us?

38:59.605 --> 39:01.573
No.

39:02.641 --> 39:06.478
Garrett, you and I
didn't make these rules.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.714
Mr. Kelly did.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.349
So what's the problem?

39:16.722 --> 39:18.990
You hear that?

39:19.991 --> 39:21.960
What, Pop?

39:22.060 --> 39:25.330
Yeah, all I hear is the human
garbage disposal to my left.
Hey.

39:25.431 --> 39:26.898
No, no, no, seriously.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.034
Listen.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.303
I don't hear
anything.

39:32.404 --> 39:33.772
Exactly.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.741
Peace and quiet.

39:35.841 --> 39:36.708
Ah.
JANKO:
Aw.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.143
JAMIE:
You guys

39:38.243 --> 39:40.045
must've had some week
with those protesters.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.379
HENRY:
Oh.
We did.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.914
Those damn cowards.

39:43.014 --> 39:45.250
They're lucky
I wasn't 20 years younger.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.585
That's right.
ERIN:
I hear there's

39:46.685 --> 39:49.120
already been some
fighting fire with fire.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.222
So I hear.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.892
Well, you mess with this family,
all bets are off.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.226
Exactly.
ERIN:
And you don't think

39:55.326 --> 39:57.496
that just creates
more of a problem?

39:57.596 --> 39:58.597
Nope.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.865
They left, didn't they?

39:59.965 --> 40:02.067
This time.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.035
What's he supposed to do,
let them camp out here?

40:04.135 --> 40:05.504
I don't know. Find a more...

40:05.604 --> 40:08.406
diplomatic solution
than an eye for an eye.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.709
An eye for an eye
would've been to send a mob

40:10.809 --> 40:12.010
to harass his father.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.479
Yeah.
ERIN:
Okay.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.681
But you know what I mean.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.416
Try to, I don't know...

40:18.517 --> 40:19.785
bridge the gap.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.620
People can't hear you
when they're screaming

40:21.720 --> 40:23.421
at the top of their lungs, Erin.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.423
So you just scream more?

40:25.524 --> 40:26.692
Erin,

40:26.792 --> 40:28.460
they fired the first shot.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.329
You're not actually taking the
protesters' side here, are you?

40:31.429 --> 40:33.865
No, I... I think I get
what she's saying.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.300
What are you talking about?

40:35.400 --> 40:37.969
You got to be the first one
to break the cycle.

40:38.069 --> 40:40.739
Well, what cycle?
They went after Henry.

40:40.839 --> 40:41.740
Right.
ERIN:
No, I know.

40:41.840 --> 40:42.941
And that's horrible.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.843
And when I found out, I was mad.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.713
But I also know
that this sort of thing

40:47.813 --> 40:49.615
is gonna continue
to happen--

40:49.715 --> 40:51.950
on all sides,
on all issues--

40:52.050 --> 40:54.586
till we have
a real conversation.

40:54.686 --> 40:59.491
There was no having a real
conversation with those people.

40:59.591 --> 41:00.859
Maybe not.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.429
Maybe... I'm just playing
devil's advocate.

41:06.565 --> 41:07.966
I don't know. Maybe.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.301
Maybe? Come on, Dad.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.939
This week I was seeing
too much red.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.842
That's the human response.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.476
Yeah. You still did
the right thing.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.945
You can't listen to her.

41:20.045 --> 41:22.681
Why not? Isn't that exactly
what we're doing here?

41:22.781 --> 41:23.815
What do you mean?

41:23.915 --> 41:25.416
Listening.

41:25.517 --> 41:28.987
What is it we do at this
dinner table every week?

41:29.087 --> 41:30.956
Stuff our faces.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.491
Always the wise guy.

41:33.592 --> 41:36.161
What we do is we weigh
and we consider

41:36.261 --> 41:38.997
and maybe
even sometimes reconcile

41:39.097 --> 41:41.432
differences of opinion.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.570
That takes two
willing participants.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.271
Funny, you saying that.
(Janko chuckles)

41:47.405 --> 41:51.342
Sometimes we do it like
we're still in the schoolyard.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.512
But we still do it.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.716
The world has lost something,

41:57.816 --> 42:01.019
moving away from traditions
like this one.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.721
We haven't.

42:02.821 --> 42:03.755
We won't.

42:03.855 --> 42:04.923
No way.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.391
Never.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.327
Hope not.

42:09.427 --> 42:12.430
If sitting at this table
has taught me anything,

42:12.530 --> 42:15.767
it is to try
to look at the other side,

42:15.867 --> 42:17.736
admit when you're wrong

42:17.836 --> 42:22.373
and, if not, at least
how you could've been better.

42:23.141 --> 42:25.944
Would you really do
it different if...

42:26.044 --> 42:27.913
you could do it all over again?

42:28.013 --> 42:30.381
No.

42:31.750 --> 42:35.186
But ask me after a couple more
years of Reagan group therapy.
