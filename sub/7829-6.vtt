00:37.954 --> 00:39.914
There it is!

00:39.998 --> 00:42.167

00:44.002 --> 00:45.962
I want a colossal donut

00:46.046 --> 00:48.423

on the sign.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.050
D'oh! Nuts.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.468
That's false advertising.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.511
Sorry, sir.
No refunds.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.347
I paid for a colossal donut,

00:56.431 --> 01:00.560

to get a colossal donut.

Uh, Chief, that
wasn't a monster.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.571
That was the captain

03:16.654 --> 03:17.822

basketball team.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.324
Uh, yeah...

03:19.407 --> 03:21.242
well, he was turning
into a monster, though.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.370
BART:
What are you waiting for?

03:24.454 --> 03:25.455
Wreck the school.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.789
You know you wanna.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.082
-Hmm.
-I agree.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.127
-Destroy the school.
-Hmm.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.264
uh, Flanders has it.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.807
Just smash open his house.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.684
He came to life.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.394

Or Moe. Go kill Moe.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.286

-Homer, just give him the donut.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.622

04:24.389 --> 04:26.140

04:26.224 --> 04:27.684
Sometimes.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.104
(Godzilla-like roar)

04:40.571 --> 04:41.823
These monsters
are destroying

04:41.906 --> 04:43.992
everything and everyone
we hold dear...

04:44.075 --> 04:46.202
and you kids should
have jackets on.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.745
Hey, what's that
in his footprint?

04:51.374 --> 04:53.084
Hmm.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.044
If your advertising agency

04:55.128 --> 04:56.754
created all those
giant characters,

04:56.838 --> 04:58.256
you must know
how to stop them.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.883
Well, sir, advertising
is a funny thing.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.469
If people stop
paying attention to it,

05:03.553 --> 05:05.346
pretty soon,
it goes away.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.223
Like that old woman
who couldn't find the beef?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.558
Exactly.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.310
If you stop paying attention
to the monsters,

05:10.393 --> 05:11.978
they'll lose their powers.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.187
But people can't help
looking at them.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.397
They're wrecking
the town.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.232
(roaring in distance)

05:16.316 --> 05:19.360

06:32.225 --> 06:33.851
Here comes something.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.478
Remember the story.

We're newlyweds on our way

-Yes.
-Take out the garbage.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.424
And then he raked me
across the chest.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.217
And the weirdest thing was

07:48.301 --> 07:51.220
it was that school janitor
who mysteriously disappeared,

07:51.304 --> 07:52.555
Groundskeeper Willie.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.265
Oh, my God, Bart,

07:54.348 --> 07:56.309
Groundskeeper Willie
was in my nightmare, too,

07:56.392 --> 07:59.729
but he got me
with hedge clippers.

07:59.812 --> 08:03.191
He ran his floor buffer over me.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.985
(chuckling) Children, I couldn't help

08:06.068 --> 08:08.362

about Willie.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.239
Why, he simply disappeared.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.366
Now, let's have
no more curiosity

08:12.450 --> 08:15.077
about this bizarre cover-up.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.538
Remember, class, the worse you do
on this standardized test,

08:17.622 --> 08:18.915
the more funding
the school gets.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.333
So don't knock yourselves out.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.753
-Finished!
-Ugh.

Then put your head down

10:36.469 --> 10:38.596
I don't like the idea
of Milhouse having

10:38.679 --> 10:40.848
two spaghetti meals
in one day.

10:40.931 --> 10:46.312
-(fire roaring)
-(anguished screaming)

10:46.395 --> 10:50.858
You'll pay for this,
with your children's blood!

10:50.941 --> 10:53.944
Oh, right. How you going to
get them? "Skeleton power"?

10:54.028 --> 10:58.115
I'll strike where you
cannot protect them:

10:58.199 --> 11:00.951
in their dreams.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.707
Bart, don't you realize
what this means?

11:06.791 --> 11:09.502
The next time we fall asleep,
we could die.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.128
Welcome to my world.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.130
(snoring)

11:13.214 --> 11:15.257
(yawning)

11:15.341 --> 11:18.135
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>...On this edition</i>
<i>of Asian Market Wrap-up:</i>

11:18.219 --> 11:21.055
<i>there's a volcano waiting</i>
<i>to erupt in the Pacific rim.</i>

11:21.138 --> 11:22.390
<i>Its name?</i>

11:22.473 --> 11:23.891
<i>Medium-term</i>
<i>convertible debentures.</i>

11:23.974 --> 11:25.393
It's no use, Bart.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.269
We can't
stay up forever.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.813
You're right.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.981
The only thing left to do
is go into my dream

11:31.065 --> 11:33.442
and force Willie
into a final showdown.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.902
You stay awake.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.404
If it looks like I'm
in trouble, wake me up.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.571
Okay.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.156
But promise you won't be
grouchy.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.450
(yawning)

11:51.210 --> 11:52.545
Come on, Willie.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.629
I know you're out there.

11:56.924 --> 11:57.842
(screams)

11:57.925 --> 11:59.093
(laughs)

12:04.724 --> 12:06.267
The sandbox.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.813
(grunts)

12:17.987 --> 12:19.029
Hey, lawn boy!

12:19.113 --> 12:20.239
You missed a spot!

12:22.366 --> 12:23.868
When I'm done with you,

12:23.951 --> 12:27.246
they'll have to do
a compost-mortem.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.340
Ach! Sinky sand!

12:38.424 --> 12:39.300
Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh!

12:41.427 --> 12:43.095
(gurgling)

12:43.179 --> 12:44.889
(sighs)

12:44.972 --> 12:46.599
Willie's gone for good.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.934
Now I can get back
to my normal dreams.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.729
Me and Krusty
winning the Super Bowl.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.730
Bart, there's
two seconds left.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.190
Now, listen up.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.524
It's your basic
Statue of Liberty play

12:55.608 --> 12:57.568
with one twist:
you throw it to me.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.737
Knute Rockne called it
the forward pass.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.864
Now, the clock's still running,
so it's important

13:01.947 --> 13:03.657
we start this play as
quickly as possible.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.950
(screams)

13:05.034 --> 13:06.702
Oh, boy.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.662
Don't dream
about me no more, kid.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.081
Help. Lisa, help!

13:11.165 --> 13:12.082
Bart, you're in trouble!
Wake up!

13:12.166 --> 13:13.834
Wait a minute.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.212
If you're here,
then you've fallen asleep too.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.338
I'm not asleep.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.464
I'm just resting my eye...

13:18.547 --> 13:20.049
Uh-oh.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.804
Good-bye, Bart.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.138
Good-bye, Lise.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.932
Hope you get
reincarnated as someone

13:28.015 --> 13:29.558
who can stay awake
for 15 minutes.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.354
(gasps)

13:36.774 --> 13:38.776
(screams)

13:47.409 --> 13:49.286
You saved us, Maggie.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.752
I don't know, Bart.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.754
Something tells me
Willie's still out there

13:58.838 --> 14:01.382
and that he could come back
any time in any form

14:01.465 --> 14:03.634
and kill us in ways
we can't even imagine.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.389
Boo!

14:08.472 --> 14:11.517
Ohh! Aah! Eeh!

14:11.600 --> 14:12.518
Yu, um... yah!

14:12.601 --> 14:14.353
(blubbering)

14:14.436 --> 14:15.354
Oh!

14:15.437 --> 14:16.355
Stop!

14:16.438 --> 14:18.274
I left my gun on the seat!

14:18.357 --> 14:19.275
Hey!

14:19.358 --> 14:20.276
(panting and gasping)

14:20.359 --> 14:21.861
Wait here, please.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.532
Ah, jeez.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.992
(panting and gasping)

14:33.205 --> 14:35.124
MARGE:
Homer, get ready.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.042
Patty and Selma
will be here any minute.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.086
D'oh. Oh, no.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.754
Better ride this one
out in the closet.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.632
Sorry, Dad.
This is our spot.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.969
Oh, yeah? Well, it's my house,
so it's my spot.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.596
Na-aw. Cause we
called it.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.180
-Did not.
-Well, we're calling it now.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.557
-You are?
-'Fraid so.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.517
They got me with
legal mumbo-jumbo.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.191
-(growling)
-(doorbell rings)

15:01.275 --> 15:03.068
MARGE:
Just a second!

15:03.152 --> 15:04.778
Doo-ooh.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.447
Huh?

15:06.530 --> 15:09.199
I never looked behind this
what-cha-ma-call-it case before.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.035
(laughing)

15:11.118 --> 15:13.162
Huh? That's weird.

15:13.245 --> 15:17.166
It's like something out of that
twilighty show about that zone.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.002
How's it hanging, Marge?

15:20.085 --> 15:23.464
Uck, I'm baking like a meat loaf
under this wet wool.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.093
Uh, may I take
your coat, Aunt Selma?

15:28.177 --> 15:31.263
Um, I would also like
to take your coat.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.893
Have we got a family
activity for you.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.812
A pillowcase full of seashells
from our trip to Sulfur Bay.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.481
You're going to help us
clean and organize them.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.274
And pry out all the
dead hermit crabs.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.026
Get a screwdriver.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.527
(squeals)

15:45.611 --> 15:47.905
I'll take my chances
in the mystery wall.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.751
HOMER'S BRAIN:
<i>Oh, glory of glories.</i>

16:00.834 --> 16:02.920
<i>Oh, heavenly testament</i>
<i>to the eternal majesty</i>

16:03.003 --> 16:04.964
<i>of God's creation.</i>

16:05.047 --> 16:07.091
Holy macaroni!

16:10.135 --> 16:11.303
(hawking)

16:11.387 --> 16:13.472
Hey. You can
just suck them out.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.057
HOMER (reverberating voice):
<i>Hello?</i>

16:15.140 --> 16:16.517
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

16:16.600 --> 16:18.435
Homer, where are you?

16:18.519 --> 16:21.480
<i>Uh, I'm somewhere,</i>
<i>where I don't know where I am.</i>

16:21.563 --> 16:22.773
Do you see towels?

16:22.856 --> 16:24.441
If you see towels,

16:24.525 --> 16:25.985
you're probably
in the linen closet again.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.195
<i>Just a second.</i>

16:28.278 --> 16:31.407
<i>No. It's a place</i>
<i>I've never been before.</i>

16:31.490 --> 16:32.491
Ah, the shower.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.076
(laughing)

16:34.159 --> 16:35.327
<i>Hey!</i>

16:43.961 --> 16:45.671
I don't want to alarm you,
Marge,

16:45.754 --> 16:48.507
<i>but I seem to be</i>
<i>trapped in here.</i>

16:48.590 --> 16:49.967
We better call Ned.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.301
He has a ladder.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.303
What's going on here?

16:53.387 --> 16:57.141
I'm so bulgy.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.351
My stomach sticks way out
in front and my...

16:59.435 --> 17:00.853
(screams)

17:00.936 --> 17:03.939
Well, as the tree said
to the lumberjack,

17:04.023 --> 17:05.899
I'm stumped.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.527
It's like he just
disappeared into fat air.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.112
(laughing)

17:10.195 --> 17:11.989
Hey, shut up!

17:23.917 --> 17:25.252
Mmm...

17:25.335 --> 17:27.379
unprocessed fish sticks.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.809
Man,

17:40.893 --> 17:42.603
this place looks expensive.

17:42.686 --> 17:46.273
I feel like I'm wasting
a fortune just standing here.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.193
(humming)

17:49.276 --> 17:50.736
Better make the most of it.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.446
(burps)

17:53.572 --> 17:54.990
Ow!

17:55.074 --> 17:57.367
Watch it, coney!

17:57.451 --> 17:59.661
(grunts)

17:59.745 --> 18:01.371
(whistling sound)

18:01.455 --> 18:02.539
Oops.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.374
Do you see
a light, Homer?

18:04.458 --> 18:06.001
<i>Yes.</i>

18:06.085 --> 18:07.753
Move into the light,
my son.

18:07.836 --> 18:08.754
(sizzling noise)

18:08.837 --> 18:09.922
<i>Ow!</i>

18:10.005 --> 18:11.465
Homer, this is
your physician

18:11.548 --> 18:13.008
Dr. Julius Hibbert.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.219
Can you tell us what
it's like in there?

18:15.302 --> 18:18.305
Um... it's like, uh...

18:18.388 --> 18:21.016
Did anyone see the
movie "Tron"?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.017
-No.
-No.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.268
-No.
-No.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.603
-No.
-No.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.771
-No.
-No.

18:25.854 --> 18:26.772
Yes.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.148
I mean, no. No.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.861
Well, where's my Dad?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.071
Well, it
should be obvious

18:34.154 --> 18:36.281
to even the most
dimwitted individual

18:36.365 --> 18:39.701
who holds an advanced degree
in hyperbolic topology

18:39.785 --> 18:42.830
that Homer Simpson
has stumbled into...

18:42.913 --> 18:44.373
the third dimension.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.626
Sorry.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.463
Here is an ordinary square.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.049
Whoa, whoa,
slow down, egghead.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.426
But suppose we
extend the square

18:56.510 --> 18:58.637
beyond the two dimensions
of our universe

18:58.720 --> 19:01.640
along the hypothetical
"z" axis there.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.308
(all gasping)

19:03.392 --> 19:06.311
This forms a three-dimensional
object known as a cube

19:06.395 --> 19:09.273
or a frinkahedron in honor
of its discoverer.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.649
Hoo-hey, hoo-hey.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.359
<i>Help me!</i>

19:12.442 --> 19:14.027
<i>Are you helping me</i>
<i>or are you going on and on?</i>

19:14.111 --> 19:15.863
Oh, right.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.490
And of course, within, we find
the doomed individual.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.908
Enough of your borax,
Poindexter!

19:19.992 --> 19:20.993
A man's life is at stake.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.244
We need action.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.166
Take that
you lousy dimension!

19:27.249 --> 19:28.458
Huh? Huh?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.461
Ah!

19:34.590 --> 19:38.302
Oh, there's so much I don't know
about astrophysics.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.180
I wish I read that book
by that wheelchair guy.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.182
(screaming)

19:46.143 --> 19:47.436
(whimpering)

19:53.025 --> 19:55.027
I'll save Homer.

19:55.110 --> 19:58.614
All I needs is four stout men
to work the bellows.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.157
No, pops. It's too risky.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.367
For all we know,
there could be cubes in there

20:02.451 --> 20:04.161
the size of gorillas
and other large...

20:04.244 --> 20:07.080
<i>Help! I don't have much time!</i>

20:07.164 --> 20:09.666
That does it.
I'm going in.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.626
Bart, no!

20:15.214 --> 20:16.882
Cool, man.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.139
Oh, my God, I'm going
to be sucked into a black hole.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.016
I'm going to be sucked
into oblivion.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.059
I'm going to be nothing.
And what's gonna be

20:27.142 --> 20:29.436
coming out the other side,
I don't know.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.854
I'll save you, Dad.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.567
Oh, I can't get any closer.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.361
You'll have to jump.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.156
Piece of cake, son.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.245
Crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap

20:46.328 --> 20:47.496
crap, crap, crap, crap...

20:49.790 --> 20:51.166
(screaming)

20:55.671 --> 20:57.839
Bart, what happened?

20:57.923 --> 20:59.675
Well, we hit a little snag

20:59.758 --> 21:01.343
when the universe sort
of collapsed on itself

21:01.426 --> 21:03.595
but Dad seemed
cautiously optimistic.
