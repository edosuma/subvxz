WEBVTT

00:08.175 --> 00:12.012
The morning God Flame has finally risen
to give us a bit of warmth, Princess.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.063
Good morning, Your Majesty.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.608
It is a beautiful day, Maghra.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.985
The entire city will rejoice with you.

00:27.528 --> 00:31.907
It is a shame Father couldn't be here
with us to celebrate your wedding day.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.916
Lilac, lavender and honey.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.294
You'll make the most appealing bride.

00:45.838 --> 00:46.839
Leave that.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.384
Princess, you must be completely
unadorned for the marriage ceremony.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.512
-No. I will not remove this cuff.
-It's the law of the land.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.973
Handmaiden, what is your name?

00:57.266 --> 00:58.809
Harmony, Your Majesty.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.603
Harmony? That is a beautiful name.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.438
Give me your hand, Harmony.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.947
Harmony,

01:12.614 --> 01:16.118
are you in the habit of telling princesses
what they may and may not do?

01:16.201 --> 01:19.580
Perhaps you would tell your queen as well?

01:19.663 --> 01:21.206
No, Your Majesty, never.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.958
Then hush and leave her.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.509
The princess is fully slathered.
You may go, Harmony.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.635
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.691
The Pennsan people,
and that means all of them,

01:47.774 --> 01:52.821
even insignificant servants,
must believe this is a true union.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.240
Don't worry. I will play my part.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.034
You're not in this alone.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.746
Yes, I am.
You are not the one being unfaithful.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.461
This marriage will serve us all.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.964
When your children are found
and brought here to you,

02:11.048 --> 02:13.592
it'll be this arrangement
that'll keep them safe.

02:19.056 --> 02:22.226
Some people would be insulted
by their sister tuning them out.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.728
Sibeth, you can never be silenced.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.355
God knows I've tried.

02:34.947 --> 02:35.948
Here.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.871
Remember when you were little,
and I'd wash your hair?

03:05.394 --> 03:06.645
Don't stop.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.067
Please.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.936
Can you please just-- just stay back?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.647
I promise you, no one is going
to kill me on this path.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.732
Yeah, well, not with me here, they're not.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.027
Haniwa. Haniwa, wait for me.

05:21.780 --> 05:27.744
Listen, there's no harm in having
a dedicated warrior by your side.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.038
I know I'm grateful
for you and your arrows.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.293
I can hear you thinking.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.216
Yesterday, I was mourning my mother.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.178
Today, she is a living princess,

05:44.845 --> 05:48.515
and I am thinking back
on every moment of my childhood,

05:49.308 --> 05:52.102
wondering what was true and what still is.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.190
We will know soon, my love.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.609
Not soon enough.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.576
You know, I'm not a threat to you.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.706
You mistake my contempt for fear.

06:15.667 --> 06:20.464
Tell me, Witchfinder General,
how many lives have you taken?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.968
Enough to damn my soul many times over.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.182
And yet, you will kill the queen
whom you have served.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.019
There is not enough damnation for you.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.190
No. I suspect not.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.284
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

06:50.452 --> 06:54.122
-We should've stayed another night.
-Nah, it's nothing.

06:55.207 --> 06:58.252
If your head fell off, you would
pick it up and carry it to Pennsa.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.338
No, I would make you carry it.

07:02.965 --> 07:03.966
Ouch.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.053
These brave soldiers died

07:08.136 --> 07:12.724
trying to stop the murderer, Baba Voss,
from escaping Trivantes.

07:13.392 --> 07:16.353
They died heroes,
and they will be avenged.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.482
A valiant soldier
of the republic remembered forever.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.404
A sacred son of Trivantes,
now one with us.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.331
Rendayo. My son.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.006
Madame Orrie.

07:45.757 --> 07:48.135
Rendayo was a patriot and a hero.

07:49.595 --> 07:53.473
I immensely admired him
as if he were my own son.

07:55.976 --> 08:00.230
Those responsible for his death
will suffer. You have my word.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.182
You have news for me?

08:35.265 --> 08:39.061
Yes, General Voss.
A Witchfinder looking for asylum.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.312
A Witchfinder.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.231
If true, this will be the first time

08:42.313 --> 08:44.358
one of Tamacti Jun's soldiers
has broken ranks.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.945
What is he trading?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.864
He insists he will speak only to you.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.618
And he will likely regret that.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.119
Bring him to me.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.288
Come on.

09:06.964 --> 09:12.386
I am Commander General Edo Voss,
and I understand you wish to speak to me.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.470
Yes, sir.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.390
You are the first
of the queen's Witchfinders that I've met

09:16.473 --> 09:20.310
that wasn't already impaled
on the end of my sword.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.855
I have information you will want, sir.

09:24.398 --> 09:29.570
And why would I trust a soldier
who betrays his own kingdom?

09:29.653 --> 09:32.781
My kingdom is no longer
the kingdom I swore to defend.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.408
And how's that?

09:34.992 --> 09:36.827
I am sworn to protect the Payan kingdom

09:36.910 --> 09:38.996
from the evils of witchcraft
and therefore--

09:39.079 --> 09:42.374
I am familiar with Witchfinders, boy.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.502
Including those who might have sight
or seek to facilitate its return.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.256
And now,
your queen decrees that the sighted

09:49.339 --> 09:51.175
are, in fact, not witches.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.803
Yes, sir.

09:54.887 --> 10:00.142
In fact, she also claims to be
carrying a sighted child in her own womb.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.269
Yes, sir.

10:02.352 --> 10:08.650
Boy, did you really desert your own army
and face certain death

10:08.734 --> 10:13.280
to come here and tell me something
my spies reported days ago?

10:15.616 --> 10:19.036
-Hobble him and sell him to the Slavers.
-No, no.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.454
-Come on.
-Sir.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.916
-Commander Voss, there are others.
-Stop!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.136
Others?

10:37.179 --> 10:40.974
Hers won't be the first sighted child
within the Payan royal family.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.519
There are two, already grown.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.608
And these children already grown…

10:51.610 --> 10:55.739
is one of them a girl called Haniwa?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.283
Yes.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.402
So, this is Pennsa?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.155
Yes.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.875
Is it always this quiet?

11:50.836 --> 11:53.046
No. Never.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.634
Something's wrong.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.146
There's soldiers ahead.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.484
Stay here and say nothing.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.447
-Should we be worried?
-Not we, you.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.807
-This is gonna be tricky.
-Why? Isn't my mother here?

12:45.891 --> 12:48.310
-She's here.
-So, what's the problem?

12:49.311 --> 12:50.604
The thing of it is,

12:51.313 --> 12:53.232
she's apparently getting married today.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.333
Baba, my love…

13:13.252 --> 13:14.294
forgive me.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.339
Mom?

13:19.758 --> 13:20.592
Mom!

13:21.426 --> 13:22.427
Kofun?

13:23.387 --> 13:25.681
Mom. Mom! Mom!

13:31.520 --> 13:32.729
You're alive.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.064
My baby.

13:35.774 --> 13:40.404
I've searched for you
every day since we were separated.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.865
I never stopped.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.703
Mom, they said
that you're getting married today.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.246
That can't be true, can it?

13:50.414 --> 13:51.874
I will explain everything.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.211
Where's your father? And Haniwa?

13:57.546 --> 13:59.715
He went into Trivantes to get her back.

13:59.798 --> 14:00.799
Trivantes?

14:01.633 --> 14:02.968
Princess Maghra, it's time.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.597
Wait. Why-- Why Trivantes?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.266
-What happened with Jerlamarel?
-How can you be getting married today?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.351
Lord Harlan is waiting,
and the queen is growing impatient.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.187
-I'm coming.
-Who is Lord Harlan?

14:13.812 --> 14:15.731
I will explain everything later.
I have to go, Kofun.

14:15.814 --> 14:19.359
-I just need you to trust me.
-Mama? Mama, you can't do this.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.945
I-- I can't stop this.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.572
Your father would understand.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.992
No, I don't think he would understand why
his dead wife is marrying someone else.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.410
-Kofun--
-Stop saying my name

14:28.493 --> 14:29.995
and do something to fix this!

14:30.078 --> 14:33.373
I don't know what is happening,
Mama, but you can't go through with it.

14:33.457 --> 14:34.625
Be quiet!

14:35.459 --> 14:39.463
I am still the mother you knew,
and you are still my son.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.216
But things have changed.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.803
Now, I'm doing this for you
and for all of us.

14:48.013 --> 14:51.141
So you stay here.
You stay here in my room,

14:51.808 --> 14:53.268
and you speak to no one,

14:54.520 --> 14:58.106
and then we will talk
when all of this is over. I promise.

15:00.359 --> 15:03.278
-I promise.
-Don't do this.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.657
-Don't do this.
-I have to.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.295
I have so many questions.

15:29.805 --> 15:30.889
All right, that's enough.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.392
-I just need a moment.
-Paris?

15:38.814 --> 15:39.815
Woman.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.193
I feel the fever through your clothing.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.864
-It's not gonna kill me.
-You need a healer.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.782
We'll find one in Pennsa.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.493
Baba.
You'll be dead by the time we get there.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.123
We are in the Lakelands now,
not far from the Valier.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.542
They will offer us shelter and a healer.

15:59.418 --> 16:00.419
Papa?

16:03.672 --> 16:04.506
Please.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.801
Okay, my love.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.680
I cannot accompany you
to Valier territory.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.099
Well, that is where we are going.

16:14.183 --> 16:17.144
Understand, the hidden tribes
were not hidden to me.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.689
The Valier suffered greatly at my hands.

16:29.364 --> 16:33.702
You stay quiet and camp nearby.
We'll find you on the way out.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.208
Or not.

17:27.506 --> 17:30.884
Our God, beyond your flame above…

17:32.970 --> 17:35.597
let your will be done on this special day

17:35.681 --> 17:38.058
in this holiest of unions.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.522
Give guidance, clear paths,

17:43.605 --> 17:49.903
condemn those who trespass against us
to writhe within your fire and smoke.

17:51.154 --> 17:57.327
For Thine is the darkness,
the power and the glory.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.873
Forever and ever.

18:23.729 --> 18:28.025
Princess Maghra and Lord Harlan…

18:32.654 --> 18:35.824
you enter this union
adorned in scented splendor.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.805
You've pledged
your commitment to each other

18:58.889 --> 19:02.017
with the joining of bodies and souls
before God.

19:03.727 --> 19:10.692
So, by the divine ordination
bestowed upon me, you may seal your union.

20:44.870 --> 20:45.871
Thank you, you too.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.378
Princess Maghra.

20:55.130 --> 20:59.843
-Any wife of Harlan's is a sister of mine.
-Maghra, you remember my brother.

21:00.552 --> 21:04.932
-Thank you.
-Kerrigan. I changed your diapers.

21:05.516 --> 21:08.352
Well. Lucky for all of us,
I have people for that now.

21:12.731 --> 21:13.774
Thank you.

21:15.567 --> 21:16.735
Thank you so much.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.029
I'm sorry. Sorry.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.033
All right. Go, go. Get off. Go.

21:36.839 --> 21:39.216
-Are we close?
-Yes.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.510
Because I don't think
the big one can make it much further,

21:41.593 --> 21:43.220
and I don't think
we'll be able to carry him.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.641
Who's there?

21:48.475 --> 21:49.518
Make yourself known.

21:49.601 --> 21:52.813
Who enters Valier territory
without announcing themselves?

21:53.438 --> 21:57.651
Brother! We bring no threat. I am Paris.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.695
We are the last of the Alkenny.

21:59.778 --> 22:03.073
No. I am last of the Alkenny.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.785
-Chet-chet.
-Chet-chet-chet.

22:06.869 --> 22:08.620
Bow!

22:09.121 --> 22:10.205
Lion.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.374
Bow Lion.

22:15.419 --> 22:16.712
Oh, Paris.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.407
Kofun?

22:46.992 --> 22:47.993
Is it you?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.538
It's okay. You're safe.

22:52.664 --> 22:53.707
I'm your Aunt Sibeth.

22:57.002 --> 23:00.422
I was overjoyed
when I heard you were finally here.

23:00.506 --> 23:03.217
We've been waiting
such a long time for you.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.769
Will you embrace me?

23:36.667 --> 23:38.418
You're taller than your parents.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.925
Would you like something?
Anything to drink? I'll send for it.

23:45.008 --> 23:47.553
No. Thank you.

23:49.096 --> 23:52.307
How tragic we're only meeting now
for the first time.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.311
You hunted us my whole life.

24:00.399 --> 24:02.776
If only Maghra
had announced herself long ago,

24:02.860 --> 24:06.029
I would've protected her, protected you.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.323
She knew that.

24:09.533 --> 24:12.578
We were hunting Jerlamarel
and his children.

24:12.661 --> 24:14.329
I didn't know they were Maghra's.

24:15.038 --> 24:18.792
I'd been led to believe
Jerlamarel had killed my sister.

24:18.876 --> 24:20.169
I believed him to be the devil.

24:20.252 --> 24:23.422
You know that's not true.
Why'd my mother stay hidden?

24:24.923 --> 24:26.466
Whatever mistakes she made,

24:27.593 --> 24:31.013
I'm sure she made them
to keep you and your sister safe,

24:31.638 --> 24:33.307
which is what I'm trying to do right now.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.851
Well, even with your decree,

24:35.934 --> 24:38.437
people in Paya still believe
a witch is to be burned.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.647
I've been known to change a few minds.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.525
It might take a bit of time,

24:43.609 --> 24:48.947
but the Payans will learn, as I have,

24:50.741 --> 24:54.119
to embrace those with sight as blessed.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.210
How difficult for you,

25:02.711 --> 25:06.423
journeying to this place,
arriving on your mother's wedding day.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.675
The world must seem upside down.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.387
But know this,

25:13.180 --> 25:17.351
no one shall stand against you,
not while you're in my kingdom.

25:18.602 --> 25:20.145
Do you believe me?

25:24.274 --> 25:25.275
I don't know.

25:26.818 --> 25:27.861
I want to.

25:29.821 --> 25:30.948
Fair enough.

25:32.115 --> 25:35.577
Many good things start with… desire.

25:43.961 --> 25:47.172
I've arranged a room for you.
We'll talk again soon?

26:05.274 --> 26:07.943
Queen Kane's war council
is mobilizing her armies.

26:08.443 --> 26:11.738
And we've learned from the Payan defector

26:11.822 --> 26:13.949
that not only has
Princess Maghra returned,

26:14.575 --> 26:17.452
but she comes with two grown children,
Haniwa and Kofun.

26:18.745 --> 26:19.955
Both sighted.

26:20.038 --> 26:23.125
The Payan fanatics
will burn them at the stake.

26:24.084 --> 26:25.878
They will do as their queen commands.

26:25.961 --> 26:28.922
With two sighted children
in the royal family now of age,

26:29.631 --> 26:31.300
they are an even greater threat.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.552
We don't know their intentions.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.720
We know they took the trouble

26:34.803 --> 26:37.222
to break their Witchfinder General
out of captivity.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.475
That is intention enough.
We must strike now.

26:40.559 --> 26:44.438
It would be suicide
for the Payans to attack us.

26:45.689 --> 26:48.984
The queen may be crazy,
but she's not a fool.

26:49.067 --> 26:52.029
Still, these are troubling developments.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.406
I can muster our forces in a matter of d--

26:54.489 --> 26:55.782
No, steady, Edo.

26:56.700 --> 27:00.204
The Ganites
are still raining shit on us out west.

27:00.287 --> 27:03.290
And you yourself stood here
and heard the council's attitude

27:03.373 --> 27:04.917
about an eastern campaign.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.337
-You will never sell it.
-No. You will do that.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.631
You overestimate my influence.

27:10.714 --> 27:13.008
I am but one third of the Triangle.

27:14.885 --> 27:15.886
But still,

27:16.595 --> 27:21.058
I will convince the council to request
a diplomatic summit with the Payans.

27:21.141 --> 27:24.645
-Trivantians do not sue for peace!
-We do what we need to do.

27:25.437 --> 27:28.273
And you will do as ordered.
Do you understand?

27:31.568 --> 27:32.694
Yes, sir.

27:32.778 --> 27:36.740
If for nothing else, it will give us time
to bring a battalion or two east,

27:36.823 --> 27:39.201
if it comes to that.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.161
Understood.

27:44.581 --> 27:48.043
I will let you know
what the council decides.

28:03.475 --> 28:07.646
Breathe slow and deep, Baba,
and drink this.

28:11.441 --> 28:12.651
It will give you strength.

28:20.534 --> 28:22.286
When did you become a healer?

28:23.579 --> 28:27.416
I'm not yet, but I've been learning
from the healers here.

28:30.210 --> 28:33.547
Those roots should absorb the infections
so that the fever can pass.

28:34.798 --> 28:38.510
You've lost so much, all because of us.

28:40.554 --> 28:41.889
Still, you take us in.

28:46.351 --> 28:47.895
We are one tribe, remember?

28:52.566 --> 28:53.817
Yeah, I remember.

29:40.405 --> 29:41.406
Kofun?

29:42.366 --> 29:44.201
No. Not Kofun.

29:46.453 --> 29:47.996
What are you doing in here?

29:48.664 --> 29:52.125
Maghra, it's our wedding night.
Where else am I gonna be?

29:55.546 --> 29:58.215
This is not a marriage.
This is an alliance.

29:58.715 --> 30:01.885
Right, but-- but it can be both.

30:06.807 --> 30:09.268
Put on your pants, Harlan.
I need your help.

30:11.103 --> 30:12.312
-Now.
-Fine.

30:36.879 --> 30:39.256
They made me sneak you
some pheasant and ale.

30:39.965 --> 30:42.718
Don't worry. I didn't poison it,
if that's what you're thinking.

30:44.928 --> 30:46.263
I had no such thought.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.807
And I had no such poison.

30:53.270 --> 30:55.564
Our Alkenny brothers and sisters,

30:55.647 --> 30:58.400
last time you came to us,
we turned you away.

30:58.942 --> 31:02.654
You healed our Bow Lion.
It is more than we could've hoped for.

31:02.738 --> 31:06.408
It is you who bring us
a message of hope upon your return.

31:06.867 --> 31:09.328
We feared that you would
lead Witchfinders to us,

31:09.411 --> 31:13.749
because when they had come prior, they
said the sighted hid amongst the Alkenny.

31:15.417 --> 31:19.338
They slaughtered men, women, children.

31:20.589 --> 31:22.382
Their blades didn't discriminate,

31:23.425 --> 31:26.720
all because the Witchfinders believed
we had knowledge of witches.

31:27.721 --> 31:30.766
Those of us who lived
were spared only to spread the fear.

31:33.268 --> 31:37.272
But we will rebuild.
We're already making babies.

31:38.106 --> 31:42.986
We will make ourselves whole to honor
the memory of the many that were lost.

31:46.031 --> 31:47.115
Stop!

31:49.785 --> 31:54.164
And now word comes that the queen
will no longer send her Witchfinders,

31:54.248 --> 31:56.375
as she no longer searches for witches.

31:58.669 --> 32:00.712
The queen may yet change her mind,

32:00.796 --> 32:06.885
but tonight, we celebrate your escape
from Trivantes and savor our freedom…

32:06.969 --> 32:08.595
[signaling] Tamacti Jun is here.

32:08.679 --> 32:11.932
…however short-lived,
from the queen and her Witchfinders.

32:13.392 --> 32:15.727
These are uncertain times,

32:15.811 --> 32:17.813
but we face them with hope

32:17.896 --> 32:20.983
for a future more peaceful than our past.

32:25.571 --> 32:27.114
Have you lost your mind?

32:28.448 --> 32:32.160
The Valier deserve retribution.
I owe 'em that much.

32:32.244 --> 32:33.829
No, you owe me, Witchfinder.

32:33.912 --> 32:37.541
You think I don't wanna rip your throat
out every time I hear your voice?

32:39.418 --> 32:41.128
You slaughtered my people too.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.464
But you do not get to die.

32:45.465 --> 32:48.177
Your punishment is you will live
with what you have done.

32:52.097 --> 32:55.893
Death must be earned too, Witchfinder,
every bit as much as life.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.335
That's his favorite spot.

33:23.045 --> 33:26.715
And… his favorite chair.

33:28.008 --> 33:29.760
Kerrigan. Come on.

33:29.843 --> 33:31.178
Wake the fuck up. Come on.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.140
Princess.

33:36.892 --> 33:38.936
I can still smell the blossoms on you.

33:39.895 --> 33:43.565
You two should be home,
rolling around in sticky sheets.

33:43.649 --> 33:44.816
I need your help.

33:44.900 --> 33:49.404
-Brother, not up to the task?
-We need you to cross the border.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.408
What's the cargo?

33:53.992 --> 33:55.494
Her daughter, Haniwa.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.956
She's being held by the Trivantian army.

34:00.874 --> 34:01.708
Yeah.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.627
Yeah, fuck off.

34:04.294 --> 34:05.295
Please.

34:05.379 --> 34:09.341
Princess, generally in my trade,

34:09.424 --> 34:12.427
the object is to avoid the military,
not go searching for them.

34:12.511 --> 34:13.762
Kerrigan.

34:20.893 --> 34:24.898
If she really is in a military brig,
I won't be able to get her out.

34:24.982 --> 34:29.194
Come on. Prison guards can be bought,
same as anybody else.

34:29.277 --> 34:30.571
Maybe.

34:30.654 --> 34:33.197
But it would take a lot of copper.

34:33.282 --> 34:34.574
For you or for them?

34:35.951 --> 34:38.661
-I am offended, Princess.
-No, he's not.

34:40.205 --> 34:44.168
No, I suppose I'm not.
Still, it would take some doing.

34:44.668 --> 34:48.088
When you find her, how will you
get her safely out of Trivantes?

34:49.089 --> 34:51.091
Getting out of the city's the easy part.

34:51.175 --> 34:55.888
I have been smuggling Ganite thornflower
from Trivantes to Pennsa for years.

34:58.599 --> 35:04.813
I know every hole and tunnel
into and out of that place.

35:06.398 --> 35:07.399
So you'll do it?

35:12.237 --> 35:16.366
Consider it… a wedding gift.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.997
I'll leave when the God Flame warms.

35:22.915 --> 35:23.999
You'll leave now.

35:25.167 --> 35:27.002
Come on. Up you get.

36:04.081 --> 36:06.375
No. Now is not the time.

36:09.002 --> 36:11.505
Paris? How could you bring him here?

36:11.588 --> 36:14.049
How could you even
share the air that he breathes?

36:14.132 --> 36:16.802
We need him. He has a new purpose.

36:16.885 --> 36:20.097
No. He dies by my hand tonight.

36:22.432 --> 36:23.559
He killed my mother.

36:23.642 --> 36:26.812
Yes. Time will come he pays for that.

36:27.688 --> 36:29.314
I can't believe this is you.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.150
You're a traitor.

36:32.693 --> 36:35.279
He is our only hope of getting to Maghra.

36:35.362 --> 36:37.781
The Witchfinders massacred the Valier.

36:39.408 --> 36:41.076
They will have
something to say about this.

36:41.159 --> 36:45.038
Please. You cannot tell them. You cannot.

36:47.207 --> 36:50.335
-I trusted you. I trusted you.
-Bow Lion. Bow Lion.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.921
You know me.

36:54.423 --> 36:56.675
You know my heart.

36:59.344 --> 37:00.179
Girl.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.143
Be gone before God Flame rises.

37:08.896 --> 37:11.190
I won't keep your secret
any longer than that.

37:38.175 --> 37:39.176
Kofun?

37:46.558 --> 37:48.101
Thank God Flame.

37:50.062 --> 37:52.481
-I told you to stay in my room.
-I know.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.441
I'm here.

37:58.570 --> 37:59.738
I'm sorry.

38:01.823 --> 38:06.161
I know this must all feel very strange
and upsetting to you,

38:06.245 --> 38:08.789
and I promise you
I will explain everything,

38:09.373 --> 38:12.167
but you cannot disobey me like that again.

38:12.251 --> 38:13.627
It is not safe here.

38:14.753 --> 38:16.713
-My sister is someone who--
-Sibeth.

38:18.674 --> 38:20.384
Don't worry. We've met.

38:22.010 --> 38:24.096
She came to see me after your wedding.

38:27.975 --> 38:29.017
Kofun.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.106
-You cannot trust her.
-Why not?

38:35.274 --> 38:37.693
She's not the one
who lied to me my entire life.

38:40.779 --> 38:42.281
It is not that simple.

38:43.782 --> 38:45.534
You betrayed your husband tonight.

38:46.827 --> 38:49.788
You betrayed all of us
and not for the first time.

38:51.206 --> 38:55.043
You could've identified yourself
to the Witchfinders when we were babies.

38:55.586 --> 38:57.796
You could've saved the Alkenny.

38:57.880 --> 38:59.590
We wouldn't have had to
spend our entire lives running.

38:59.673 --> 39:03.802
My sister would never have accepted
any sighted children that weren't her own.

39:05.429 --> 39:07.723
She would've killed all of us.

39:07.806 --> 39:10.309
I was trying to protect you
the best way I knew how.

39:10.392 --> 39:12.561
-By lying to us.
-Of course by lying to you.

39:12.644 --> 39:14.354
The truth would've gotten you
burned at the stake.

39:14.438 --> 39:15.439
No.

39:16.440 --> 39:21.778
You resented us.
You resented our sight. You always have.

39:22.779 --> 39:25.824
That's why you were so angry
when you realized we'd learned to read.

39:27.159 --> 39:28.160
Wasn't it?

39:29.828 --> 39:33.957
You wouldn't speak to us.
We'd become unrecognizable you said.

39:34.708 --> 39:37.169
Do you recognize yourself, Mama?

39:39.463 --> 39:40.631
Because I don't.

39:42.049 --> 39:46.512
You and Haniwa belong to a world
that I couldn't begin to understand.

39:48.222 --> 39:51.600
I was terrified that one day
it would take you away from me.

39:55.938 --> 39:57.231
Looks like it did.

40:03.028 --> 40:04.780
What are you doing about Haniwa and Dad?

40:07.950 --> 40:10.327
Lord Harlan has already
sent someone to find them.

40:17.125 --> 40:20.462
Right, I'm sure your new husband
is very determined to find your old one.

40:54.204 --> 40:58.542
You asked me
if I remember how many I had killed.

41:02.296 --> 41:05.716
That's like me asking you
how many breaths you took today.

41:21.440 --> 41:25.402
When the queen left me bleeding to death…

41:28.071 --> 41:29.865
I fell into a state.

41:31.867 --> 41:35.954
Not dead… but no longer among the living.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.710
And it was there…

41:43.587 --> 41:44.796
suddenly…

41:47.591 --> 41:48.926
I had vision.

41:53.347 --> 41:54.681
Do you know what I saw?

42:01.188 --> 42:02.606
I saw faces.

42:05.108 --> 42:08.403
I saw the faces…

42:09.029 --> 42:14.743
of every man, woman and child
that I had murdered and tortured.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.290
I heard their screams.

42:23.001 --> 42:24.753
I could feel their pain.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.011
But in all of those faces…

42:35.639 --> 42:41.311
I could not find that of my wife
nor of my children.

42:46.233 --> 42:52.447
I was not there when Queen Kane
drowned them in their beds.

42:59.621 --> 43:00.873
Instead…

43:03.792 --> 43:08.380
I was butchering all those faces.

43:11.175 --> 43:16.054
For years and years,
you have fought for darkness.

43:19.349 --> 43:22.186
Now you must fight for light.

43:26.773 --> 43:29.193
You should not have stopped the girl.

43:36.783 --> 43:40.871
All right. No more stopping.
We walk until we reach Pennsa.

43:41.830 --> 43:42.831
Do not fear.

43:44.666 --> 43:48.462
You will have
plenty of opportunities to die.

43:50.255 --> 43:51.465
We all will.

43:53.967 --> 43:58.388
I always thought that
the fact that I could see and you couldn't

43:59.181 --> 44:01.016
was something that separated us.

44:02.684 --> 44:04.895
Thought there was
so much space between us.

44:05.521 --> 44:09.608
But every time
I feel like I'm beyond help,

44:10.817 --> 44:16.031
in the House of Enlightenment,
in Trivantes, somehow you always find me.

44:19.493 --> 44:24.206
You're my baby girl.
Kofun is my boy, Maghra my wife.

44:25.082 --> 44:29.628
As long as I'm alive,
nothing will separate us. Yes.

44:33.757 --> 44:35.342
I know I don't make it easy.

44:38.262 --> 44:39.471
No, you don't.

44:41.181 --> 44:43.058
From this place, it's two days to Pennsa.

44:45.727 --> 44:48.230

44:50.065 --> 44:51.066
Crowded.

44:53.318 --> 44:55.028
What do you think she'll be like?

44:56.989 --> 44:58.824
-She'll be like Maghra.
-Right.

45:00.742 --> 45:02.661
