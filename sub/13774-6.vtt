00:10.911 --> 00:12.555
RUXIN: Honey.

00:12.675 --> 00:15.081
Oh, God, look at my wedding dress.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.445
It looks so big on me.
TACO: What?

00:16.565 --> 00:18.918
Yeah, I didn't do the fitting beforehand.
I was stupid.

00:19.053 --> 00:19.820
Are you kidding?

00:19.888 --> 00:22.022
Everyone was saying how
beautiful your dress was.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.790
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey.

00:23.925 --> 00:24.992
Hey, baby.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.027
Taco, what are you doing here?

00:27.095 --> 00:27.995
You here to rattle my cage?

00:28.062 --> 00:30.596
No, no, no, I'm not playing this week.
I have a buy week.

00:30.732 --> 00:32.465
No, teams have buy weeks.
I know, I have a team.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.401
We're playing each other this week.
What are you doing here?

00:35.536 --> 00:38.357
- I'm here to celebrate
your fifth anniversary. -Yes.

00:38.477 --> 00:41.587
He's here to collect some photos
for a very special anniversary gift.

00:41.707 --> 00:44.476
You don't have to do anything for
our anniversary, all right, Taco?

00:44.612 --> 00:47.136
At least somebody wants to do
something for our anniversary.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.828
He's a bit of an anniversary grinch.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.550
- What?
- Yeah.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.653
This guy, no, he's so romantic.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.988
He probably has, like, a huge
surprise planned for you.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.089
Don't you?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.925
Do you?

00:57.992 --> 01:03.497
Yeah, it was going to be a big
surprise anniversary party.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.498
Honey.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.732
Now, Taco, you've ruined it.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.200
That is so sweet.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.201
Thank you.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.036
I'm so sorry.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.938
I went and ruined the whole thing.

01:11.005 --> 01:14.441
He was probably going to do it at the place
where you guys had your first date, right?

01:14.575 --> 01:15.542
Mm-hmm, that was the idea.

01:15.610 --> 01:16.543
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.

01:16.611 --> 01:18.143
Oh, stupid.
You know what?

01:18.279 --> 01:20.980
The surprise is kind of ruined.
Maybe we should just not do it at all.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.116
No, no, you would have to do it.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.050
No, no, we have to do it.
For Sofia.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.054
He was going to invite all
your friends and your family.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.956
He was going to rent
the whole place out.

01:29.023 --> 01:33.060
- Ooh. - You're going to have, like,
a caterer, a really expensive one.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.061
It's like another wedding.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.896
Except slightly more expensive.

01:35.964 --> 01:38.565
Yeah, for you, baby, anything.
Yeah, anything.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.700
He doesn't care about money.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.969
He was going to hire me to be the DJ.

01:42.036 --> 01:43.036
No, I was not.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.905
I'll just do a little
instrumental set then.

01:44.973 --> 01:49.209
No, no, there will be no music
from you in any fashion.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.744
It's okay, come here.

01:50.812 --> 01:51.745
Come here.

01:51.813 --> 01:54.982
(whispering): Taco.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.969
Peace.

02:02.843 --> 02:04.491
JENNY: Ruxin.

02:04.559 --> 02:07.494
"You are all cordially invited."

02:07.562 --> 02:08.662
Completely tacky.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.764
Well done, guys.

02:10.832 --> 02:15.234
Saturday on my birthday again?
Unbelievable.

02:15.370 --> 02:17.236
KEVIN: On Jenny's birthday?
Perfect.

02:17.372 --> 02:19.306
I don't have to plan anything, I
don't have to buy anything.

02:19.374 --> 02:20.140
The night's spoken for.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.908
Yeah, well, I can't
take credit for that.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.311
It was all your goddamn
brother's idea.

02:24.379 --> 02:25.312
We're playing this week.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.480
He's trying to get in my head.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.656
Very cunning that Taco.

02:27.776 --> 02:30.399
You seriously gonna sit here and not eat
a goddamn thing?

02:30.519 --> 02:32.766
Look at this shit shag.
I wouldn't eat anything here.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.530
You guys have
all like gutter bowels, alright?

02:34.650 --> 02:37.373
I have a very refined, educated bowel.

02:37.493 --> 02:39.993
That's why I'll be going
to the Gastro Pub down the block.

02:40.113 --> 02:42.117
*

02:42.237 --> 02:43.289
I don't know what's worse.

02:43.409 --> 02:46.436
*** my phone or that bedazzled
bluetooth you have in your ear.

02:46.556 --> 02:48.828
Okay, first of all,
these are swarovsky crystals.

02:48.948 --> 02:50.850
And it matches my phone.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.370
You look like gay Iron Man.

02:52.490 --> 02:53.478
- Yeah.
- Uh...

02:53.598 --> 02:55.335
I think he means gay Tony Stark.

02:55.588 --> 02:57.980
- Yeah, read your comics, bro.
- Yeah, nicely done.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.478
Look, understand that

02:59.598 --> 03:03.316
latest in fashion, design,
technology, and my lady likes it.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.385
Oh, by the way, she's my plus one.

03:05.453 --> 03:09.289
Okay, no, you can't just bring some
rando girl because you have a plus one.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.524
She's not a rando girl, okay?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.225
She likes me, she's super
techie, very cool.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.326
You guys are going to love her.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.094
Oh.
The techie.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.930
Yeah.
I get it.

03:17.065 --> 03:19.798
What? That explains
all the tech gear.

03:19.934 --> 03:20.901
No, I just like this stuff.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.702
Come on, you're a boyfriend
chameleon, you know this.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.304
Am not.
Yes, you are.

03:24.439 --> 03:27.707
You are so desperate for shared
interests, you basically just

03:27.775 --> 03:29.576
adopt whatever hobbies the
person you're dating has.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.176
Not true.
Not true?

03:31.312 --> 03:33.279
Not true.
Lest I bring up Hippie Girl.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.147
Anyone, please chime in.
Absolutely.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.250
Okay, all right, you know what?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.186
Starchild was wonderful, all right?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.388
I was Hacky-Sacking way
before I ever met her.

03:41.456 --> 03:43.223
You know who else did RSVP?
Who?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.057
Is Megan.
Ooh.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.825
And she RSVP'd plus one.
Oh, no.

03:46.961 --> 03:49.862
So? I think that's,
I think it's great.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.698
Awkward.

03:51.766 --> 03:52.766
It's not awkward, it's great.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.768
Oh, yeah, it's great that your
ex-wife is going to show up

03:54.836 --> 03:55.869
with a plus one to a party.

03:55.937 --> 03:57.771
I want Megan to move on, okay?

03:57.839 --> 03:59.639
I'm happy for her that
she's found someone.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.342
You don't want her to be happy.
No way.

04:02.477 --> 04:04.311
You just want her not to sit
around 24-7 hating you.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.979
That's part of it.
You're being selfishly selfless.

04:07.115 --> 04:09.970
I prefer the term
"altruistically self-serving."

04:10.090 --> 04:11.952
Oh, shit, I got to get back to work.
Congratulations.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.447
I got to get out of here.
Enjoy it.

04:13.567 --> 04:16.822
To the bathroom real quick.
I'm not waiting for this bathroom.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.091
Um, I got to race to the office.

04:18.159 --> 04:19.607
See you, guys.
Later.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.774
Bye, buddy.

04:23.064 --> 04:25.098
Oh, shit.

04:25.166 --> 04:26.538
Uh...

04:38.146 --> 04:40.847
(door opens and closes)

04:40.915 --> 04:43.817
Oh, come on.

04:43.885 --> 04:47.087
No, wait, no, it's occ...
No.

04:47.155 --> 04:47.921
(man grunting)

04:47.989 --> 04:50.790
Come on.

04:58.095 --> 04:58.881
Sofia...

04:59.001 --> 05:00.636
You look absolutely scrumptious.

05:00.704 --> 05:03.205
And you look like a Russian figure skater.
Oh, thank you.

05:03.340 --> 05:06.655
Hey, hey, hey, no, I said
bottled water on the tables.

05:06.775 --> 05:08.474
What?
Money is not an issue.

05:08.610 --> 05:10.578
How many times do I have
to tell these people?

05:10.645 --> 05:12.646
I'm sorry, guys, I'll be right back.

05:12.714 --> 05:14.582
You take care of it, honey, thanks.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.343
Jesus, look at this place.

05:16.463 --> 05:18.168
Do me a favor and say
"Happy anniversary."

05:18.288 --> 05:19.912
I will when she says
"Happy birthday."

05:20.032 --> 05:21.952
No, you say it first.
Hi.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.208
Oh. Hi, guys.
Kevin and Jenny. Wow.

05:23.588 --> 05:25.425
Hi, Jenny.
You look lovely.

05:25.545 --> 05:26.595
Thank you.

05:26.715 --> 05:29.085
This is the same dress that I
wore at my rehearsal dinner the

05:29.205 --> 05:30.572
night before my wedding.

05:30.826 --> 05:32.604
Oh, the night before my birthday?
My wedding.

05:32.724 --> 05:34.109
My birthday.
My wedding.

05:34.229 --> 05:35.418
My birthday.
My wedding.

05:35.538 --> 05:36.564
Five years ago?

05:36.684 --> 05:37.908
Can you believe the dress still fits?

05:38.028 --> 05:40.327
Actually, I had to take
it in just a little bit.

05:40.447 --> 05:42.437
I am going to go get a drink.

05:42.557 --> 05:44.575
I will get it... okay,
see you over there.

05:45.337 --> 05:46.303
Hey, guys, how's it going?

05:46.371 --> 05:48.105
Why are you eating an ice
cream sandwich, Pete?

05:48.173 --> 05:50.007
When do you ever see an
ice cream truck anymore?

05:50.075 --> 05:50.941
I had to go for it.

05:51.009 --> 05:52.309
Okay, that explains that.

05:52.377 --> 05:53.477
What is this little...?

05:53.545 --> 05:57.782
Ah, this is my newest
invention... Bathroom Cubby.

05:57.849 --> 06:00.384
Got to go to the bathroom, but
you got some food in your hand,

06:00.452 --> 06:02.386
something you don't
want in the bathroom.

06:02.454 --> 06:03.454
This is outside the bathroom.

06:03.522 --> 06:06.957
You stick your sandwich in there,
come back out, everything's clean.

06:07.025 --> 06:08.726
This is brilliant.
Mm-hmm.

06:08.860 --> 06:11.462
I won't even chew gum and go
into the bathroom because I'll

06:11.530 --> 06:14.165
end up chewing whatever
it is I smell in there.

06:14.232 --> 06:16.667
Everybody in the end
needs a Bathroom Cubby.

06:16.735 --> 06:17.668
He doesn't need one.

06:17.736 --> 06:19.904
You have been keeping busy, I see.

06:19.971 --> 06:21.839
Hey.
Hi.

06:21.973 --> 06:23.673
How's it going?
It's really good.

06:23.809 --> 06:25.942
Ted, this is my ex-husband Pete.
Pete.

06:26.078 --> 06:26.844
How you doing?

06:26.912 --> 06:29.380
Uh, I got some... Oh, let me ke...
Here, get a little bit of

06:29.448 --> 06:31.482
that, little bit of that.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.718
It's a pleasure, it's a real pleasure.

06:33.785 --> 06:35.853
Wow, good, uh, firm handshake there.

06:35.921 --> 06:37.521
He works out.

06:37.589 --> 06:40.157
I've got to say thank
you for letting her go.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.059
Paved the way to my happiness.
What can I say?

06:42.194 --> 06:44.361
I'm a, I'm a spiritual
bulldozer, if you will.

06:44.429 --> 06:45.362
(laughter)

06:45.430 --> 06:47.096
Well, come on over.
Happy, happy, happy.

06:47.232 --> 06:48.765
You look gorgeous.
Nice to meet you.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.433
Hi, handsome.
Nice to meet you.

06:50.569 --> 06:52.403
We have a little gift for you.

06:52.471 --> 06:54.170
All right.
Yes.

06:54.306 --> 06:55.306
It's a Nepalese dream box.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.475
Yeah, we just got back from Nepal.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.343
It's something we like to do
every night before we go to

06:59.411 --> 07:01.245
sleep... we put our dreams in there.

07:01.374 --> 07:02.043
Cool.

07:02.163 --> 07:03.449
So, anyway, happy anniversary.
Thank you so much.

07:03.569 --> 07:05.739
It's a gorgeous gift. I mean...
Guys, quick question.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.251
What does that box actually do?

07:07.371 --> 07:09.004
'Cause this one actually
is pretty practical.

07:09.127 --> 07:10.027
I got an idea.

07:10.095 --> 07:13.297
Why don't we put the dream
locker in the dump locker?

07:13.365 --> 07:14.731
Yeah, there you go.
You know what, honey?

07:14.866 --> 07:17.567
Would you like a drink?
I'm going to get you a Jack and ginger.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.502
Thanks, babe.
I can come with you though.

07:19.638 --> 07:22.238
No, no, no, no.
Closure's a beautiful thing.

07:22.374 --> 07:24.842
Thanks for being emotionally
above-board and awesome, Ted.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.310
Isn't he awesome?

07:26.378 --> 07:28.145
I like Ted.
He is really cute.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.545
Yeah.
Come on. Let's go talk.

07:30.749 --> 07:32.016
All right, all right.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.983
Good spot for that.
I like it.

07:34.119 --> 07:36.853
I won't bite.
That thing doesn't even make sense.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.990
Did I just see Megan walk
in with her grandfather?

07:39.057 --> 07:39.857
No.

07:39.925 --> 07:42.692
Where is my drink, sweetheart?
I don't know, but this is my third.

07:42.828 --> 07:46.063
And we are entering into the
fifth anniversary party.

07:46.131 --> 07:47.473
Why are you filming us?

07:47.593 --> 07:49.020
- It's for my vlog.
- Blog.

07:49.287 --> 07:50.835
No, it's a video blog. Vlog.

07:50.955 --> 07:52.150
Everybody, this is Stacy.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.436
Hi.
Hi.

07:53.572 --> 07:54.505
Oh, my God.

07:54.573 --> 07:57.241
It is so great to finally
meet you guys in person.

07:57.309 --> 08:00.075
Thank you. Rodney?
Ruxin.

08:00.195 --> 08:01.433
Oh, my God.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.469
I found some of your college
poetry on an archived Prodigy

08:04.537 --> 08:09.374
page, and I just have to say,
"Hernanado's Song" was beautiful.

08:09.442 --> 08:11.241
What is she talking about?
It was beautiful.

08:11.377 --> 08:13.143
And you, Kevin.
Whoa.

08:13.279 --> 08:15.113
How many times do I have to
poke you before you accept my

08:15.181 --> 08:16.381
friend request on Facebook?

08:16.449 --> 08:18.650
I don't even know who you are.

08:18.718 --> 08:20.951
Sofia, Oh, my God.
Hmm?

08:21.087 --> 08:22.354
Oh.

08:22.421 --> 08:26.157
(whispering): By the way, I love
the nose job; it's perky, cute,

08:26.225 --> 08:29.027
but it doesn't rob you of
your ethnicity, you know?

08:29.095 --> 08:30.662
Anyway, I'm going to grab a drink.

08:30.730 --> 08:31.663
Okay.

08:31.731 --> 08:33.264
Do you want something?
Whatever you're having.

08:33.399 --> 08:35.332
Yeah?
All right, great.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.234
Isn't she great?
No.

08:37.370 --> 08:39.135
She's weird.
Totally weird.

08:39.272 --> 08:40.772
What do you mean, she's weird?
No.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.972
She's strange, man.
Shit's natural, bitch.

08:43.109 --> 08:44.809
Okay, guys, just chill out.

08:44.877 --> 08:46.476
She Googled you guys.
No, no.

08:46.612 --> 08:48.278
She Googled too deep.
She's a deep Googler.

08:48.414 --> 08:50.547
She's like page five shit, man.
Come on.

08:50.683 --> 08:52.617
No, actually, I am kind o
curious about this whole poetry

08:52.685 --> 08:54.119
thing you've got going on, Rodney.

08:54.186 --> 08:55.286
Come on.
It was a goof.

08:55.421 --> 08:56.721
I got it right here.
No. No.

08:56.856 --> 09:00.992
"With auburn hair and dark,
dark eyes, Hernando rode the

09:01.112 --> 09:05.452
steed of love into the
gallows of my heart."

09:05.594 --> 09:07.131
Hernando's a man's name.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.834
You're not weird about Ted and...
Ted? No. Ted?

09:10.902 --> 09:13.803
Honestly, like, I think Ted is great.
He is great.

09:13.938 --> 09:16.373
In fact, I've never met anybody who's
been through the Great Depression.

09:16.441 --> 09:18.042
I'd be curious to get a
firsthand retelling.

09:18.109 --> 09:19.376
Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah.

09:19.444 --> 09:21.879
But seriously, I'm glad
you found someone.

09:21.946 --> 09:25.049
I can see why you'd be attracted to an
older man, 'cause you are very mature.

09:25.116 --> 09:26.649
You always have been.
He is very mature.

09:26.785 --> 09:29.253
But, there is the wild Megan.

09:29.321 --> 09:31.055
What happens when...
He's wild.

09:31.122 --> 09:33.090
Really?
Totally.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.259
What happens when you guys are
at a party and you're ready

09:35.327 --> 09:37.582
to let it rip, and he wants
to go home at 8:15?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.631
- He can hang.
- Oh, he can hang?

09:39.751 --> 09:41.318
Oh, honey, he can hang.

09:42.946 --> 09:45.940
Hey, if we could have
your attention real quickly.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.868
We just want to welcome you all

09:47.988 --> 09:51.867
And we're so honored to have you
come and join us at our anniversary party.

09:51.987 --> 09:53.091
Or my birthday party.

09:53.211 --> 09:54.305
So uh...

09:54.350 --> 09:55.698
I just wanted to say when...

09:55.759 --> 09:56.773
Listen up everyone...

09:56.893 --> 09:58.301
If we can get your attention over here.

09:58.337 --> 10:00.371
I think Ruxin has
a little something to say.

10:00.582 --> 10:03.058
Okay, well we started that already, Taco.

10:03.310 --> 10:04.409
When I decided

10:04.949 --> 10:06.722
many many months ago

10:06.842 --> 10:09.381
to throw an anniversary
party for my wife...

10:09.501 --> 10:12.162
I'm sorry.
Can just interrupt for one second?

10:12.230 --> 10:13.356
Do you... Oh, sure.
Come on up.

10:13.476 --> 10:15.164
Uh, thank you.
I'm sorry.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.101
I know this is a very special day.

10:17.168 --> 10:21.225
The love between Ruxin and
Sofia reminds me of my

10:21.345 --> 10:22.940
relationship with my beautiful wife.

10:23.007 --> 10:26.769
Love is a symphony, and
love is a partnership.

10:28.446 --> 10:33.913
And love is...
Sorry, I said I wouldn't do it.

10:36.253 --> 10:38.856
I just... I thank you for
sharing your life with me.

10:38.923 --> 10:39.890
Thank you.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.859
Oh...
(applause)

10:41.926 --> 10:43.659
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

10:43.795 --> 10:46.296
Oh, that's...
Come here.

10:46.364 --> 10:48.265
Please, I had so much more to say.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.333
Oh, that's so thoughtful.

10:49.401 --> 10:51.835
Anyway, I just wanted to say
how honored I am... Oh, God.

10:51.903 --> 10:53.537
Everybody, have fun.

10:53.605 --> 10:54.937
Have fun tonight.
All right!

10:55.073 --> 10:55.873
(Sofia cheers)

10:55.940 --> 10:56.974
(glasses clinking)

10:57.041 --> 10:59.308
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday.

11:00.272 --> 11:01.274
Hey, you know what, Ted?

11:01.311 --> 11:03.378
These guys are in a fantasy league.

11:03.446 --> 11:05.380
Oh, uh, fantasy football?

11:05.448 --> 11:07.181
Yeah, yeah.
Great.

11:07.317 --> 11:08.684
You like football, Ted?

11:08.752 --> 11:11.820
Ted's actually in a real league.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.788
Eight-man, 12-man?
What is it?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.257
I'm in a-a park league.

11:15.325 --> 11:16.592
You play?

11:16.659 --> 11:18.193
You play? Wow.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.930
Muddy field, no helmet, no pads,
out there every Saturday.

11:21.998 --> 11:22.931
Wow.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.599
Like Favre in those Wrangler ads?
With other guys.

11:25.735 --> 11:28.604
Actually... Honey, no, don't be so...
Don't be modest.

11:28.671 --> 11:30.539
It's nice to be able to stick
somebody once in a while.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.040
Babe, what are you going to have?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.674
I'm going to have salmon.
Salmon, uh, yeah.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.676
I'll have salmon, too, yeah.
Good choice, yeah.

11:35.812 --> 11:38.688
I'm going to go ahead and have
the bacon-wrapped filet, please?

11:38.808 --> 11:40.918
And if you could double up the
bacon on that, that'd be great.

11:41.038 --> 11:42.803
Go for it, buddy.

11:42.923 --> 11:44.811
Yeah, sounds good. Definitely, yeah.

11:44.931 --> 11:46.598
You should try it.
You should try it.

11:46.718 --> 11:48.120
Yeah, come on. Have a steak.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.413
Yeah, you should.
What the hell..,

11:50.712 --> 11:52.850
Yes!!
Give me a filet rare.

11:52.970 --> 11:55.181
Yeah, Ted.

11:55.547 --> 11:58.114
Alright, Ted. Live a little. I like it.
About the time, right?

11:58.234 --> 12:00.055
Do it, let's do it. You know what?

12:00.175 --> 12:02.461
You have not seen anything yet.
It's fun.

12:02.581 --> 12:04.758
We're gonna have some shots.
It's your birthday.

12:04.878 --> 12:06.896
We need shots.
Yeah, top shelf.

12:07.216 --> 12:08.595
Yeah, yeah, I like it.

12:08.715 --> 12:09.781
Hey guys?
Yeah.

12:09.901 --> 12:10.906
Doesn't need to be top shelf.

12:11.026 --> 12:13.115
Oh, no, no. We're not driving.
Taco got us all cars.

12:17.719 --> 12:19.712
When you're like, with Ted,

12:19.832 --> 12:21.566
what is it like?
Amazing.

12:21.686 --> 12:22.476
The sex?

12:22.596 --> 12:26.566
A 30-year-old sloth is far
less useful to me than a

12:26.634 --> 12:28.768
60-year-old finely tuned machine.

12:28.836 --> 12:31.303
Really?
Really.

12:31.439 --> 12:34.207
Oh, my God.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.275
And then there's that.

12:35.342 --> 12:36.908
There's this.
There's that.

12:37.044 --> 12:37.977
Right?

12:38.045 --> 12:40.180
Your random plus one just
tweeted about my anniversary.

12:40.247 --> 12:41.014
That's so great.

12:41.082 --> 12:42.515
And did she use the
hashtag "great event"?

12:42.583 --> 12:44.984
All I know is that I just got a
call from my cousin who is one

12:45.052 --> 12:47.753
of her 831 followers on Twitter.
That's so cool.

12:47.888 --> 12:50.290
No, because he wasn't invited
because I don't want

12:50.357 --> 12:52.525
him here because he collects ferrets.

12:52.593 --> 12:54.861
Well, that's what you get when
you live your life on the net.

12:54.929 --> 12:57.564
You know, your life on the net is
even sadder than your life on Earth?

12:57.631 --> 13:00.233
Well, really? If I'm so sad, then
how do I know that Cedric Benson?

13:00.591 --> 13:02.459
Out for the game.
What?

13:02.593 --> 13:04.394
Yeah.
You got to make a change.

13:04.529 --> 13:06.362
Thank you for this.
I actually do appreciate it.

13:06.497 --> 13:08.763
See? There's benefits.
Ah, ah, ah, ah! No phones.

13:08.967 --> 13:10.866
Bad Rodney.
Bad Rodney.

13:11.002 --> 13:12.002
No, no, no.

13:12.070 --> 13:15.505
I promised you guys a special night
and that means no distractions.

13:15.573 --> 13:19.376
So I am confiscating this phone and
you'll get it back tomorrow morning.

13:19.444 --> 13:21.510
No phone.
No phone, sweetie.

13:21.646 --> 13:22.579
Okay.

13:22.647 --> 13:23.914
Hey.

13:23.982 --> 13:26.750
I don't know what kind of
cockamamie bullshit you're

13:26.818 --> 13:28.452
pulling here, but I'm onto you.

13:28.519 --> 13:30.787
Nobody else thinks you've got
anything running around in your

13:30.855 --> 13:32.789
head, but I know about
your little plan.

13:32.857 --> 13:35.125
Oh, you found out about
my wedding video?

13:35.193 --> 13:36.560
What?

13:36.627 --> 13:38.795
Can I have your attention, everyone?

13:38.863 --> 13:42.065
It has taken me five years, but
I've finally completed Ruxin and

13:42.133 --> 13:44.735
Sofia's wedding gift,
their wedding video.

13:44.802 --> 13:46.770
But we already have a wedding video.

13:46.838 --> 13:49.039
Yes, but I was shooting behind
the scenes footage with

13:49.107 --> 13:51.375
my own camera without
any of you knowing.

13:51.442 --> 13:54.710
I wanted to capture the wedding's
"cinnamon very day" style.

13:54.846 --> 13:56.446
Can we bring the lights down, please?

13:56.514 --> 13:58.415
Enjoy.
Oh.

13:58.549 --> 13:59.549
All right. Yeah.

13:59.617 --> 14:00.150
(applause)

14:00.218 --> 14:01.418
Yay.

14:01.486 --> 14:02.419
Hey.

14:02.487 --> 14:03.487
Religious horror film.

14:03.554 --> 14:04.554
Lovely.

14:04.622 --> 14:07.791
Yeah, there...
there's Ruxin's penis.

14:07.859 --> 14:10.627
Whoa!

14:10.695 --> 14:12.429
That's not your hand, Ruxin.

14:12.497 --> 14:14.598
Why am I watching my wife in lingerie?

14:14.665 --> 14:16.233
Taco, come in.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.335
Hey, Sofia, you excited?

14:18.403 --> 14:19.503
Yes, I am.

14:19.570 --> 14:20.337
Oh, it's okay.

14:20.405 --> 14:21.338
It's just Taco. It's fine.

14:21.406 --> 14:22.938
Come on in. Come on in.
Come on in.

14:23.074 --> 14:24.707
You've been working out.
I can tell.

14:24.842 --> 14:26.376
Mmm.
Not hard enough.

14:26.511 --> 14:28.311
Oh, yeah, no, you've
definitely been working out.

14:28.379 --> 14:29.579
You look sexy.

14:29.647 --> 14:30.781
Really, Taco?

14:30.848 --> 14:32.449
There you go.
I heart you.

14:32.583 --> 14:33.494
I heart you, too.

14:33.614 --> 14:35.452
All right, I'm going to say something.
I thank you.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.165
That was...
Oh, boy...

14:38.285 --> 14:40.605
Okay, you know...
I thank you.

14:40.725 --> 14:41.858
It was a long time ago.

14:41.926 --> 14:44.594
Guys, long time ago.

14:44.662 --> 14:46.263
Hey, guys.

14:46.330 --> 14:47.697
What's going on?

14:47.765 --> 14:49.432
Hey, it's me!
Guys remember Jasmine, right?

14:49.567 --> 14:51.201
Boyfriend chameleon!

14:51.269 --> 14:52.669
You know what?

14:52.737 --> 14:54.037
I like that... I like that suit.

14:54.105 --> 14:56.473
You look great, Dr. Huxtable. 
What?

14:56.607 --> 14:57.607
You look really great.

14:57.675 --> 14:58.708
Thank you.

14:58.776 --> 15:00.542
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You'll be fine.

15:00.678 --> 15:02.611
Hey!
There you go!

15:02.747 --> 15:06.116
I'm worried that her family
full of conquistadors is going

15:06.184 --> 15:09.386
to round up my whole family and
stick us in a basement and put

15:09.454 --> 15:11.121
yellow stars on us.

15:11.189 --> 15:13.457
That's the worst-case scenario.

15:13.524 --> 15:15.158
What is it with Catholicism?

15:15.226 --> 15:17.828
Why is the baby running the show here?

15:17.895 --> 15:19.029
No, no, don't touch!

15:19.097 --> 15:20.629
Don't touch!
You'll burn your skin.

15:20.765 --> 15:22.632
I don't know why I am
marrying this woman.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.068
Why couldn't I just marry a
nice Jewish girl... Andrea

15:25.136 --> 15:26.703
Greenblatt in fourth grade?

15:26.771 --> 15:27.804
Because you like blow jobs.

15:27.872 --> 15:29.039
I love blow jobs!

15:29.107 --> 15:31.708
I haven't even written
my vows yet, Kevin.

15:31.776 --> 15:33.677
Your vows are the easy part.

15:33.744 --> 15:35.045
Very simple.

15:35.113 --> 15:36.313
This is what you do.

15:36.380 --> 15:39.149
Love is a... any noun you want.

15:39.217 --> 15:40.550
Any noun you want, all right?

15:40.618 --> 15:41.518
You just do that.

15:41.586 --> 15:43.653
"Love is a journey.

15:43.721 --> 15:45.722
Love is a commitment."

15:45.790 --> 15:48.142
And on the third one,
you can't get it out.

15:48.262 --> 15:52.762
"Love is a...
Hold on, give me a second.

15:52.830 --> 15:55.065
I can't get it out.

15:55.133 --> 15:57.234
"I just... I need a second.

15:57.301 --> 15:59.002
Love is a wonderful thing."

15:59.070 --> 16:00.537
And that's it... done.

16:00.605 --> 16:05.673
What I felt tonight...
Was "insert adjective here."

16:07.912 --> 16:09.179
They're not going to make it.

16:09.247 --> 16:10.847
Some people just aren't like us.

16:10.915 --> 16:12.182
We'll last forever.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.250
We'll last forever.

16:13.317 --> 16:15.252
Are you really getting
married in a church?

16:15.319 --> 16:16.520
I kind of want to.

16:16.587 --> 16:19.489
Is it terrible that I want
to (bleep) your brains out?

16:19.557 --> 16:21.424
In this church, now?

16:21.492 --> 16:23.326
It's wonderful, actually.

16:23.394 --> 16:24.728
I saw a coat closet.

16:24.795 --> 16:27.497
Mmm.

16:27.565 --> 16:29.366
I'm so horny right now.

16:29.433 --> 16:31.203
I want to (bleep) you
in the coat room so badly.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.534
I just...

16:32.654 --> 16:34.433
Guys, we'll be right back.
Watch my purse.

16:34.553 --> 16:35.178
Alright.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.627
I guess they left a coat in the coat room,
or something. That's all I heard.

16:44.332 --> 16:46.038
Alright, can we bring up the lights please?

16:46.600 --> 16:48.271
That was amazing.

16:48.391 --> 16:49.220
Whoo.

16:49.459 --> 16:51.471
I have one more surprise for you guys.

16:51.907 --> 16:55.065
The top of your original wedding cake.

16:55.185 --> 16:56.303
We're gonna have it for desert.

16:56.673 --> 16:58.307
You had second thoughts
about our marriage?

16:58.375 --> 17:00.076
No, I didn't have second
thoughts about our marriage.

17:00.143 --> 17:01.077
You didn't want to marry me?

17:01.144 --> 17:03.624
No, of course, I wanted to marry you.

17:03.744 --> 17:06.093
Uh, I need to go to the bathroom.
Uh, can someone watch my iPad?

17:06.213 --> 17:07.767
Oh, just put it in the,
uh, bathroom cubby.

17:07.887 --> 17:09.669
I set it all up.
You sure? Yeah.

17:11.469 --> 17:12.784
I know how to make this right.

17:12.904 --> 17:13.797
No, you don't.
Cake.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.232
You made it wrong.
I'll make it right.

17:15.352 --> 17:16.627
You embarrassed me.
Cake.

17:33.377 --> 17:34.610
Hey.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.912
Hey.

17:35.979 --> 17:38.581
You brought my iPad into the bathroom?

17:38.649 --> 17:42.585
Yeah. Taco has organized this
whole night just to mess with me

17:42.653 --> 17:45.454
and beat me this week, and I'm not
going to let that frittata do it.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.423
He's a sly fox.
No, he's not a sly fox.

17:47.557 --> 17:49.792
He's at the bar trying to cut his
own hair with a knife, okay?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.160
You leave that in the cubby.

17:51.228 --> 17:53.595
Give me my iPad.
Let me just take her in peace.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.264
Give me my iPad.
It's my anniversary.

17:55.399 --> 17:56.699
Fine.

17:56.767 --> 17:58.701
Fine.

17:58.769 --> 18:02.471
(door opens and closes)

18:02.860 --> 18:04.261
Give me my iPad.

18:04.328 --> 18:06.795
We've been saving that cake for five years.
Get it out of the bathroom.

18:06.931 --> 18:08.631
Ooh, let it take it in.
No!

18:08.766 --> 18:10.433
Take in all the bathroom scent.

18:10.501 --> 18:12.100
Get that cake out of here.
Give me the iPad.

18:12.236 --> 18:13.770
Give me the cake!
Give me the iPad.

18:13.904 --> 18:15.171
Oh!

18:15.239 --> 18:17.607
Oh, shit.

18:17.675 --> 18:19.209
No!

18:19.277 --> 18:20.844
Urinal cake!

18:20.911 --> 18:23.113
You are so screwed.

18:23.180 --> 18:24.347
Keep the iPad.

18:24.415 --> 18:26.182
My gift to you.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.951
Happy anniversary.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.452
I can make this right.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.322
I can make this right.

18:32.390 --> 18:33.790
All right.

18:33.858 --> 18:35.659
Here we go.

18:35.726 --> 18:39.162
Our original wedding cake
from five years ago.

18:39.230 --> 18:40.363
Oh, that looks good.

18:40.431 --> 18:44.334
But, you know, it's been around for
five years sitting in the freezer.

18:44.402 --> 18:48.470
It's probably got freezer burn, so...
He's going to eat the urinal cake. Shh, shh.

18:48.606 --> 18:50.674
And you're...
you're probably still angry with me.

18:50.741 --> 18:51.875
No, I'm not still angry.

18:51.942 --> 18:53.376
Taco and I talked it over.

18:53.444 --> 18:54.811
This night's too important.

18:54.879 --> 18:59.449
Well, uh, then, let's, uh...
let's do this, okay? Mm-hmm.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.384
We should just eat the...
Oh, no!

19:01.452 --> 19:02.719
Ooh!

19:02.787 --> 19:05.622
Oh, that's weird that I caught that.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.957
Usually, my reflexes are terrible.

19:08.025 --> 19:13.314
All right, everyone. Since Ruxin planned,
orchestrated and paid for this entire event,

19:13.750 --> 19:15.044
You get the first bite.

19:15.164 --> 19:16.700
You evil genius.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.234
All right, everyone.

19:18.302 --> 19:25.041
Cake, cake, cake...
(all chanting "Cake")

19:25.109 --> 19:26.309
(groans)

19:26.377 --> 19:28.244
Come on, honey.
Come on!

19:28.379 --> 19:29.713
Honey, open your mouth.

19:29.780 --> 19:31.381
Come on.

19:31.449 --> 19:32.916
Cake, baby.

19:32.983 --> 19:34.217
Open your mouth.

19:34.285 --> 19:37.387
(whooping and hollering)

19:40.057 --> 19:41.257
All right, guys.

19:41.325 --> 19:42.492
Dance party time.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.593
Come on, let's dance.

19:43.661 --> 19:44.694
We'll sit this one out.

19:44.762 --> 19:46.730
Hey, I thought we were
going to hang, guys.

19:46.797 --> 19:47.931
Oh, we're going to hang.

19:47.998 --> 19:50.266
Ted, we're hanging.

19:50.334 --> 19:53.399
If you're not feeling well...
No, he feels fantastic.

19:53.519 --> 19:54.356
Let's go.

19:59.143 --> 20:03.113
(whooping)

20:03.180 --> 20:04.714
Come on, Teddy.

20:04.782 --> 20:06.349
You all right, Ted?

20:06.417 --> 20:07.851
Hey, Ted, you okay?

20:07.918 --> 20:09.952
Aah!
Whoa!

20:10.087 --> 20:11.087
Ted's not hanging.

20:11.155 --> 20:13.990
Yes, he is going to hang.

20:14.058 --> 20:16.159
He's getting green.

20:16.227 --> 20:17.727
(Sofia screams)

20:17.795 --> 20:19.696
Teddy.
Excuse me, excuse me.

20:19.830 --> 20:22.399
Ted, are you... are you...
honey, are you okay?

20:22.466 --> 20:23.700
Oh, he's doing great.

20:23.768 --> 20:27.135
Hey, Ted. Really great
hanging with you, buddy.

20:27.271 --> 20:28.271
Might want to call 911.

20:28.339 --> 20:29.506
See you later.

20:29.573 --> 20:31.007
That's a hard fall.

20:31.075 --> 20:32.675
Megan, is your dad okay?

20:32.743 --> 20:35.078
Babe, I'm so sorry about today.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.579
I really screwed up.

20:36.647 --> 20:37.647
Why?

20:37.715 --> 20:39.716
It's kind of the best birthday ever.

20:39.784 --> 20:41.650
Really?
Are you kidding me?

20:41.770 --> 20:44.316
It's like a dream wreck.
I can't look away.
