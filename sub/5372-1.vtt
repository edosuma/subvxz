05:08.809 --> 05:11.178
PLUS, I ALREADY SENT

05:51.284 --> 05:53.320
DAD, YOU DON'T THINK
TERRI'S SPECIAL?

05:53.387 --> 05:56.957
- PAUL, SERIOUSLY.
- I THINK SHE'S THE MOST SPECIAL
HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.358
SHE'S MY GIRL.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.060
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
NOT GOING TO L.A.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.263
SHE'S 16, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.999
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
APPLY FOR THIS.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.669
IF SHE GETS IN,
IT'S PROOF SHE BELONGS THERE,
BUT YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?

06:08.736 --> 06:11.605
LOOK, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I THOUGHT I KNEW
EVERYTHING TOO.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.607
BUT I'VE SEEN
A LOT MORE OF THE WORLD
THAN YOU HAVE, PAUL.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.876
WHAT PARTS OF THE WORLD
HAVE YOU SEEN, DAD?

06:15.943 --> 06:18.011
THE BACK AND FRONT
OF YOUR DAD'S RESTAURANT?

06:18.078 --> 06:20.414
OKAY, OKAY.
PAUL, THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.283
WELL, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
STUCK HERE, YOU WANT EVERYONE
STUCK WITH YOU.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.954

a hold on me *

08:47.728 --> 08:51.765

08:51.832 --> 08:55.703
* One more mile to Jericho

08:55.769 --> 08:57.738

08:57.805 --> 08:59.573
* The walls will tumble--

08:59.640 --> 09:01.341
( mouse clicks )

09:01.408 --> 09:03.711
* The music fills the space

09:03.777 --> 09:08.015

09:08.081 --> 09:11.785
* And I know
it's gonna be all right. *

09:11.852 --> 09:13.053

10:54.788 --> 10:55.989

- ( laughs )

11:02.529 --> 11:04.097
THIS IS A FIRST.

11:04.164 --> 11:08.902
WELL, WHO KNOW WHEN WE'LL EVER
BREAK THE LAW AGAIN, RIGHT?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.638

ABOUT IS LEAVING YOU HERE.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.562
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
WE GET ALONG OKAY.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.530
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
WORRIES ME.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.767
IT'S MORE THAN
GETTING ALONG, TERRI.
YOU PLEASE THEM.

11:39.833 --> 11:44.004
YOU'RE LIKE
A STEPFORD DAUGHTER OUT
OF A MAIL-ORDER MAGAZINE.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.240
IS THAT
A FORM OF FLATTERY?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.509
AFTER DAD SLAMMED YOU
ON BRISTOL-HILLMAN,

11:49.576 --> 11:53.546
- YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
THAT DIDN'T HURT?
- NO, IT TOTALLY HURT.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.848
THEN MAKE A SCENE!

11:54.915 --> 11:58.151
BREAK SOMETHING! SCREAM!
I... SOMETHING.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.353
HUH-HUH. TANTRUMS WERE
NEVER MY THING.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.622
TERRI, YOU'VE GOT THE BEST
VOICE I'VE EVER HEARD,

12:02.689 --> 12:06.526
BUT IF YOU HANG
WITH THE "WORLD ACCORDING
TO SIMON FLETCHER" ANY LONGER,

12:06.593 --> 12:09.763
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DOING "CATS"
AT THE Y AT 40.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.599
- ( laughs )
- AND THAT WOULD SUCK.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.534
THAT WOULD SUCK.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.603
* HOME!

12:16.669 --> 12:21.108
* THIS HOUSE
IS NOT A HOME... *

12:21.174 --> 12:26.179
- OH MY GOD!
- * THIS HOUSE
IS NOT A HOME. *

12:34.621 --> 12:37.590
WHAT'S UP, FLAGSTAFF?
HOW YOU GUYS DOING, ALL RIGHT?

12:37.657 --> 12:40.160
( cheering )

12:40.227 --> 12:42.062
YEAH.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.137
( rock music playing )

12:57.044 --> 13:01.348
* YOU SAID
WE'D NEVER GET THIS FAR *

13:01.414 --> 13:03.750
- * YOU SAID YOUR WORDS
- * WORDS

13:03.817 --> 13:06.019
* WE PLAYED OUR PARTS

13:06.086 --> 13:10.090
* SAID YOUR TWO CENTS
NOW IT'S MY TURN *

13:10.157 --> 13:14.828
* SO SIT DOWN, SHUT UP,
ARE YOU READY? *

13:14.895 --> 13:19.199
* SO YOU THINK YOU KNOW

13:19.266 --> 13:21.534
- * HOW THIS STORY GOES...
- LITTLE HELP?

13:21.601 --> 13:24.905
- * ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?
- PAUL, DON'T-- OH MY GOD.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.173
* SIT DOWN!

13:26.239 --> 13:28.508
* ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.643
* SHUT UP!

13:30.710 --> 13:32.913
* ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

13:32.980 --> 13:35.182
* STAND UP!

13:35.248 --> 13:37.650
* ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

13:37.717 --> 13:39.920
* THIS GAME

13:39.987 --> 13:42.055
* ARE YOU READY?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.360
* ARE YOU READY?

13:53.733 --> 13:55.768
* ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.770
* SIT DOWN

13:57.837 --> 14:00.473
* ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.542
* SHUT UP

14:02.609 --> 14:04.844
* ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

14:04.912 --> 14:07.514
* STAND STRAIGHT!

14:07.580 --> 14:09.716
* ARE YOU READY?

14:09.782 --> 14:11.518
PAUL, LOOK OUT!

14:14.087 --> 14:15.655
( horn blares )

14:15.722 --> 14:17.190
( crashes )

14:17.257 --> 14:21.328
* ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.104
( heart beating )

14:42.249 --> 14:44.918
( monitor beeping )

14:58.498 --> 14:59.933
( gasps )

15:00.000 --> 15:02.302
OH! THANK GOD.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.604
( sobbing )

15:12.879 --> 15:14.181
PAUL?

15:16.349 --> 15:17.317
NO.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.252
( sobbing )

15:24.024 --> 15:25.858
Doctor:
HEALING NICELY.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.028
STILL GOT THAT HEADACHE?

15:31.298 --> 15:33.967
CAN YOU TELL ME
YOUR BIRTHDAY?

15:34.034 --> 15:36.436
APRIL 20TH.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.871
LET'S LET TERRI
GET THE NEXT ONE.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.974
TELL ME WHAT MONTH IT IS.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.977
- ( faintly ) JUNE.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

15:44.044 --> 15:45.278
WHY CAN'T SHE SPEAK?

15:45.345 --> 15:49.582
TERRI, TELL ME WHAT MONTH
IT IS OUT LOUD.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.284
IT'S JUNE.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.319
THAT'S GOOD.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.454
NOW FOLLOW THIS LIGHT
WITH YOUR EYES.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.528
( gasps )

16:01.594 --> 16:04.731
DOC, STOP!
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
JUST STOP.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.128
I WISH I WAS OLDER.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.098
I'M SO AFRAID
I'LL SAY SOMETHING STUPID
AND MAKE IT WORSE.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.172
( silent )

16:48.408 --> 16:50.210
( silent )

17:37.224 --> 17:38.758
HEY, AUNT NINA.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.594
HI, TERRI BOO-BERRY.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.762
HONEY.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.500
- WHY WAS THIS IN THE TRASH?
- YOU GOT IN.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.968
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:49.035 --> 17:52.605
- PAUL WOULD BE SO PROUD OF YOU.
- MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.407
IF PAUL WERE HERE,
HE WOULD JUST GET

17:54.474 --> 17:56.643
IN ANOTHER SCREAMING FIGHT
WITH DAD ABOUT IT.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.678
OKAY. EVERYTHING
IS DIFFERENT NOW.

17:58.745 --> 18:02.649
- DO YOU STILL WANT TO GO?
- I DON'T WANT TO SING ANYMORE.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.351
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT,
TERRI.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.358
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
HANDLE YOUR DAD
ABOUT THIS.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.830
- SO, I THINK TERRI
SHOULD COME VISIT ME.
- Simon: HMM.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.866
SIMON, I REALLY THINK
SHE NEEDS TO GET AWAY

18:19.932 --> 18:22.935
AND I'D LIKE HER
TO COME TO PALM DESERT
FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.638
A MONTH WITH YOU,
ALONE IN THE DESERT?
ARE YOU NUTS?

18:28.074 --> 18:30.343
IT IS ALONE, ISN'T IT?

18:30.410 --> 18:33.280
I'M BETWEEN GUYS RIGHT NOW.
SO YES, I'M ALONE.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.647
YEAH, FOR THE MOMENT.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.485
WELL WHO'S GOING TO HELP ME
IN THE RESTAURANT?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.620
OH, IS THAT REALLY WHAT
YOU WANT TO SAY, SIMON?

18:40.687 --> 18:43.390
"WHO'S GONNA HELP ME
WITH THE RESTAURANT?"

18:48.261 --> 18:50.563
AUNT NINA, WHO SAID
THAT YOU COULD DO THAT?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.965
I'VE NEVER LIED
TO MY FATHER BEFORE.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.368
TERRI, I JUST THINK
THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.337
YOU DESERVE
THE CHANCE TO LIVE IT.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.472
THEN WHY
DOES IT FEEL SO WRONG?

19:01.308 --> 19:03.075
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR DAD

19:03.142 --> 19:04.944
THAT I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW.

19:05.011 --> 19:09.616
HE AND HIS FRIEND
DAVID BOTH GOT FOOTBALL
SCHOLARSHIPS TO UCLA.

19:09.682 --> 19:10.650
REALLY?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.819
AND WHEN GRADUATION
ROLLED AROUND,

19:12.885 --> 19:15.021
OUR FAMILY RESTAURANT
WAS DOING GOOD,

19:15.087 --> 19:17.390
BUT OUR PARENTS WEREN'T.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.659
NEITHER OF US
WANTED THE RESTAURANT,

19:19.726 --> 19:22.829
BUT YOUR DAD FELT HE HAD
NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE IT.

19:22.895 --> 19:26.666
AND, UH, HIS FRIEND DAVID
WENT ON TO UCLA.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.402
AND HE GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE L.A. SCENE

19:29.469 --> 19:31.971
AND HE'S BEEN MESSED UP
EVER SINCE.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.773
BUT I KNOW

19:33.840 --> 19:36.343
THAT IF YOUR DAD HAD TAKEN
THAT SCHOLARSHIP,

19:36.409 --> 19:39.679
HE WOULD HAVE MADE IT.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.549
SO, WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

19:42.615 --> 19:44.851
I DON'T KNOW.
EVERYTHING?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.588
BUT IT'S
YOUR DECISION, TERRI.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.560
( sighs )

19:59.832 --> 20:01.701
( mother sobbing )

20:34.100 --> 20:35.968
( clears throat )

20:39.372 --> 20:41.841
( sighs )

20:41.908 --> 20:43.776
( coins rattle )

20:49.816 --> 20:51.484
( sighs deeply )

20:52.819 --> 20:55.622
HE WOULD HAVE WANTED
YOU TO HAVE THIS, HONEY.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.957
PAUL WOULD HAVE WANTED
YOU TO HAVE THIS.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.363
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SNUCK HIM OUT.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.097
OH, HONEY,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,

21:05.164 --> 21:10.803
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
- I FEEL SO BAD ALL THE TIME.

21:10.870 --> 21:11.871
NO.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.176
I CAN'T DO THIS.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.979
I CAN'T GO.
I CAN'T LIE TO DAD.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.714
IT'S JUST TOO SOON.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.282
HONEY...

21:23.350 --> 21:25.352
I WILL TELL DAD THAT YOU'RE
REALLY NOT AT NINA'S

21:25.418 --> 21:27.354
WHEN THE TIME
IS RIGHT.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.956
AND HE'S GONNA BE
MAD AT FIRST.

21:30.022 --> 21:34.627
BUT HE'S GONNA REALIZE
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

21:34.694 --> 21:38.431
- ARE YOU SURE IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO?
- NO.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.701
I'M NOT SURE
OF ANYTHING.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.404
I JUST WANT
YOU TO BE HAPPY.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.940
( sniffles )

21:53.245 --> 21:54.681
OKAY.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.315
( sniffles )
I'LL DO IT.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.684
OKAY.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.822
( sighs deeply )

22:14.734 --> 22:16.335
ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA BE OKAY?

22:16.403 --> 22:18.070
- ( faintly ) YEAH.
- YEAH. WE'LL BE FINE.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.072
UH, I'M TAKING HER
TO THE TRAIN STATION.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.108
AND, UH, NINA
WILL PICK HER UP
ON THE OTHER END.

22:22.174 --> 22:26.446
- WE'LL BE FINE.
- HERE YOU GO.
THIS IS FOR YOU.

22:29.716 --> 22:30.883
DAD.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.820
I DON'T WANT NINA TO PAY
FOR EVERYTHING, AND UH...

22:33.886 --> 22:38.024
- YOU WANNA COME HOME EARLY,
YOU CALL US, OKAY?
- OKAY.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.358
I LOVE YOU.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.062
ME TOO.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.501
- CALL ME, OKAY?
- OKAY.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.505
( engine starts )

23:11.357 --> 23:12.692
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.761
YOU JUST CALL US
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.897
AND MAKE SURE YOU CONFERENCE
AUNT NINA IN WHEN YOU DO,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER,

23:17.964 --> 23:21.601
- HE'S GONNA WANT TO TALK TO HER
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. OKAY?
- GOT IT, MOM.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.736
( train bell ringing )

23:25.672 --> 23:28.641
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU.

23:28.708 --> 23:33.345
* LIFT OFF, HERE I AM,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.848
* STAND BACK,

23:35.915 --> 23:39.318

24:02.909 --> 24:05.244

I'LL GET IT.
- THANK YOU.

24:05.311 --> 24:06.479
SURE.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.820
WHERE DID
MY JACKET GO?

24:15.855 --> 24:18.791
WELCOME TO L.A., BABY.
HOP IN.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.560
- IT'S GONE.
- ( scoffs )

24:20.627 --> 24:22.795
* LIFT OFF,
HEY YOU *

24:22.862 --> 24:25.598
* GET USED TO MY FACE

24:25.665 --> 24:28.434
* I'LL BE TAKING

24:28.501 --> 24:30.537
* 'CAUSE THE RIDE HAS BEEN

24:30.603 --> 24:32.872
* A LITTLE OFF TRACK

24:32.939 --> 24:35.875
* FROM NOW ON
I'M ON THE STRAIGHTEST PATH *

24:35.942 --> 24:39.345
* GOT THAT LOOK IN MY EYE

24:39.411 --> 24:42.649

25:03.335 --> 25:05.171
( police siren blaring )

25:10.509 --> 25:12.579
( sighs )

25:15.748 --> 25:17.684
OH, COME ON.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.687
- ( knocking )
- HELLO?

25:20.753 --> 25:22.589
HEY! IS ANYONE THERE?

25:24.290 --> 25:27.994
OH-HH--

25:28.060 --> 25:29.562
HELLO!

SORRY, FULL UP.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.535
HEY!

25:42.274 --> 25:44.744
LOOK.
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE
A HABIT OUT OF THIS?

25:44.811 --> 25:46.378
OKAY. IT'S LATE
AND I'M TIRED

25:46.445 --> 25:49.649
AND ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GET UP TO MY DORM.
OKAY?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.651
WHAT'S THE PASSWORD?

25:55.187 --> 25:57.890
OKAY. I THINK
WE STARTED OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.326
- I'M TERRI.
- JAY.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.802
IT'S "MONKEYS"
BY THE WAY.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.938
- THE PASSWORD.
- MM-HM.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.309
- WHAT ROOM?
- UM...

26:17.376 --> 26:18.310
315.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.079
JAY.
THERE YOU ARE.

26:20.146 --> 26:24.150
SEND YOU OUT FOR A SNACK
AND YOU BRING HOME A STRAY.
SHAME.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.018
MMM.

26:26.085 --> 26:26.986
HEY. I'M TERRI.

26:27.053 --> 26:30.289
- UH-HUH.
- I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.091
BYE.

26:32.158 --> 26:35.494
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'VE GOT IT
FROM HERE. THANKS.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.764
- SEE YA.
- WHEW.

26:41.467 --> 26:43.703
- WHAT?
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
WHAT DID I SAY?

26:43.770 --> 26:45.371
- I'M SERIOUSLY...
- 315.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.941
OH.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.912
SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

26:56.515 --> 26:59.485
HEY. I'M TERRI,
YOUR NEW ROOMMATE.

26:59.551 --> 27:03.055
GREAT. AND I THOUGHT
I HAD THIS PLACE TO MYSELF.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.058
- NOW TURN OUT
THE DAMN LIGHT!
- SORRY.

27:21.507 --> 27:23.375
( phone beeps )

27:35.822 --> 27:38.057
( sighs )
OH MY GOSH.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.831
( sighs )
OKAY. OKAY.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.067
( telephone ringing )

27:57.844 --> 27:59.545
- TERRI?
- HEY. IT'S ME.

27:59.611 --> 28:03.282
OH, THANK GOD, TERRI.
YOUR DAD'S CALLED
TWICE ALREADY.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.884
WELL, THE TRAIN WAS LATE

28:04.951 --> 28:07.353
AND MY JACKET GOT STOLEN

WE'RE SORRY, SIMON.
HER TRAIN WAS LATE.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.481
OH. WELL.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.350

28:44.390 --> 28:45.925
WHICH IS IT?

28:45.992 --> 28:48.327
WE'RE EATING DINNER
WHILE WE'RE WATCHING TELEVISION.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.997
- RIGHT.
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A TELEVISION, NINA.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.866
I THOUGHT THAT WAS AGAINST
YOUR ARTISTIC SENSIBILITIES.

28:53.933 --> 28:57.669
OH, WELL, I-I-- I FINALLY
GAVE IN. SUE ME.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.807

29:07.546 --> 29:09.048
DON'T CORRUPT MY BABY.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.783
She's too much
like you already.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.085
DON'T WORRY, SIMON.
I'LL HAVE HER TATTOOED,
WITH BLUE HAIR,

29:13.152 --> 29:17.556

IN NO TIME. NIGHTY-NIGHT.
- Good night, Nina.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.091

GOOD NIGHT, MOM.
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.
I LOVE YOU.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.562
BYE-BYE.
I LOVE YOU.

29:23.629 --> 29:25.497
( sighs )

29:27.466 --> 29:30.436
I THINK THAT WORKED.
I THINK I DID IT.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.212
WELL, PAUL,

29:40.279 --> 29:41.413

31:13.105 --> 31:15.607

31:24.183 --> 31:27.086
( laughing )
IN CASE YOU BOUGHT
THAT OLD SAW

31:27.153 --> 31:28.988
THAT THOSE WHO CAN'T DO,
TEACH.

31:29.055 --> 31:32.558
THESE TALENTED MUSICIANS
BESIDE ME ARE YOUR TEACHERS.

31:32.624 --> 31:35.594
BUT I'D PREFER YOU
TO THINK OF THEM AS YOUR GUIDES.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.797
HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO BRISTOL-HILLMAN'S
SUMMER MUSIC PROGRAM.

31:38.864 --> 31:40.466
I'D LIKE TO START
BY REMINDING YOU

31:40.532 --> 31:43.635
OF THE LARGE NUMBER
OF TALENTED STUDENTS
WHO APPLIED

31:43.702 --> 31:45.371
BUT DID NOT GET IN.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.605
NOW,

31:46.672 --> 31:50.709
THIS SUMMER
IS NOT JUST ABOUT
LEARNING YOUR CRAFT.

31:50.776 --> 31:51.710
IT'S ABOUT

31:51.777 --> 31:53.479
TESTING YOUR LIMITS.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.215
EXPERIMENTING.
NEW EXPERIENCES.
IT'S ABOUT

31:56.282 --> 31:58.684
BUILDING UP AND ROCKING
THE FOUNDATION OF THAT

31:58.750 --> 32:02.421
WHICH WILL GIVE YOU
YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL VOICE.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.755
NOW, SOME BASICS.

32:03.822 --> 32:07.159
WE HAVE A STRICT 10:00 CURFEW,
11:00 ON THE WEEKENDS.

32:07.226 --> 32:11.563
POSSESSION OF BANNED SUBSTANCES
WILL MEAN IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.599
HMM. THIS IS L.A., PEOPLE.

32:13.665 --> 32:17.003
USE SOME COMMON SENSE.
TRAVEL IN PAIRS.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.438
LASTLY, THE SCHOLARSHIP.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.773

32:21.840 --> 32:23.042
WE WILL HAVE
FINAL PERFORMANCES

32:23.109 --> 32:25.044
WHERE YOU SHOW US
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

32:25.111 --> 32:29.148
NOW A LUCKY STUDENT
WILL WIN A $10,000 ACADEMIC
SCHOLARSHIP

32:29.215 --> 32:31.950
FOR MUSIC STUDY.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

32:32.018 --> 32:34.786
SO, WORK HARD.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.756
HAVE FUN.
( laughs )

32:37.823 --> 32:40.226
GET LOST.
( all chuckle )

32:42.494 --> 32:44.030
LATER.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.797
OKAY.

32:45.864 --> 32:48.267
I GAVE HER THREE CHANCES.
THE CHANCES HAVE COME AND GONE.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.868
SEND HER BACK
WHERE SHE CAME FROM.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.937
I DON'T CARE!

32:52.004 --> 32:55.241
PEOPLE, GRAB A SEAT.
MY NAME IS MR. TORVALD.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.344
YOU ARE MY CLASS
AND WE HAVE THREE WEEKS

32:58.410 --> 33:01.347
TO LEARN AN INCREDIBLY
COMPLEX CHORAL PIECE.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.249
IT AIN'T EVER GONNA HAPPEN,

33:03.315 --> 33:06.052
BUT LET'S GIVE IT THE OL'
COLLEGE TRY, SHALL WE?

33:06.118 --> 33:08.020
THERE ARE FIVE SOLOS
IN THE ENSEMBLE.

33:08.087 --> 33:12.191
ONLY FIVE PEOPLE
WILL PERFORM SOLOS

33:12.258 --> 33:14.760
AND I WILL HAND THEM OUT
IN TWO WEEKS

33:14.826 --> 33:18.130

EXERCISES

33:18.197 --> 33:19.431
AND JE NAI SAIS QUOI.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.767
IF YOU'RE NOT FRENCH,
THAT MEANS,

33:21.833 --> 33:23.035
"OOH!"

33:23.102 --> 33:25.837
I WILL ALSO SPLIT YOU UP
INTO GROUPS OF FOUR.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.639
YES, I STILL COUNT
ON MY FINGERS.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.176
ONE FOR EACH PART
IN THE OBNOXIOUSLY DIFFICULT

33:30.242 --> 33:32.611
CONTRAPUNTAL HARMONY
AT THE END OF THE BOOK.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.146
THIS PIECE IS GONNA
DRIVE YOU NUTS.

33:34.213 --> 33:38.117
BUT WHEN YOU NAIL IT,
IT FEELS GOOD.

33:38.184 --> 33:39.751

YOU THERE.
WHAT IS THE NOTE?

35:45.477 --> 35:47.879
- A "B?"
- B FLAT!

35:47.946 --> 35:51.650
THE ABILITY TO KNOW
ANY NOTE WHEN YOU HEAR
IT IS GREAT ASSET.

35:51.717 --> 35:55.521
THOSE OF YOU WHO
DON'T HAVE IT MUST WORK
THAT MUCH HARDER.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.690
IS THE SAME WITH YOUR
ABILITY TO READ MUSIC.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.626
YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
ARE EXPANDED.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.261
IF YOU LOOK
AT A PIECE OF MUSIC,

36:02.328 --> 36:04.530
SEE HOW THE NOTES
ARE ARRANGED ON THE PAGE

36:04.596 --> 36:07.199
AND HEAR EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS,

36:07.266 --> 36:09.535

LEARN TO DO THIS SUMMER

36:11.703 --> 36:14.206
IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL STUDIES

37:03.822 --> 37:04.990
( sighs )

37:09.428 --> 37:11.162

37:11.229 --> 37:14.366
- AM I BOTHERING

37:14.433 --> 37:17.369
I MEAN, I JUST GET
THE FEELING THAT I'M SOME
KINDA PAIN IN YOUR BUTT.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.371
LOOK, IT'S NOT EVEN
LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT?

37:19.438 --> 37:21.172
I'M HERE
FOR THAT SCHOLARSHIP.

37:21.239 --> 37:25.076
- I'M JUST ABOUT HARDCORE FOCUS.
- WELL IT SEEMS REALLY PERSONAL.

37:25.143 --> 37:28.580
OH, PLEASE.
I'M NOT EVEN TRYING
TO HEAR THAT.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.517

37:33.819 --> 37:38.357
AND NOT GET CAUGHT UP

41:53.478 --> 41:54.980
THANKS ANYWAYS.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.001
( giving sermon )

42:36.321 --> 42:38.156
( gasps )

42:38.223 --> 42:40.692
YOU'RE A SERIOUS WEIRDO.
YOU KNOW THAT?

42:40.759 --> 42:42.761
IT ISN'T LUCKY
UNLESS IT'S FACE UP.

42:42.828 --> 42:46.164
BUT NOW IT'S JUST A PENNY
THAT THINKS IT'S LUCKY,
BUT IT ISN'T.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.534
WELL NOW IT CAN BE LUCKY
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.337
BESIDES, HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF MAKING YOUR OWN LUCK?

42:55.807 --> 42:58.877
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
A LUCKY PENNY.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.614
( laughs )

43:07.619 --> 43:09.154
( car horn blaring )

43:09.220 --> 43:11.389
Terri:
SO, AN ENGLISHMAN IN L.A.

43:11.456 --> 43:15.126
YEAH, MY PARENTS PUT
AN OCEAN BETWEEN THEM AFTER
THE NASTIEST DIVORCE EVER.

43:15.193 --> 43:17.595
- ( laughs )
- NO JOKE, PEOPLE STUDY IT.

43:17.663 --> 43:19.164
- ( laughs )
- ( Spanish guitar playing )

43:19.230 --> 43:21.599
SO, HOW CAN YOU HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT THAT?

43:21.667 --> 43:23.601
MY MUSIC BECAME
LIKE A RELIGION.

43:23.669 --> 43:24.803
IT KEPT ME SANE.

43:27.639 --> 43:30.108
SO, MUSIC IS YOUR
HIGHER POWER.

43:30.175 --> 43:32.644
PRETTY MUCH.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.

43:32.711 --> 43:35.513
THIS CITY.
ALL THESE PEOPLE.

43:35.580 --> 43:38.349
ALL THIS LIFE
AND MUSIC.

43:38.416 --> 43:40.418
I'M GONNA MAKE MUSIC
FOR THEM.

43:40.485 --> 43:43.121
I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER WAY
TO SPEND MY LIFE.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.260
ARE YOU MISSING HOME?

43:49.327 --> 43:51.162
A LITTLE BIT.

43:51.229 --> 43:54.966
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST BEEN REALLY
TOUGH LATELY.

43:55.033 --> 43:56.034
COME ON.

43:56.101 --> 43:59.070
I JUST GAVE YOU MY
"E! TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY."

43:59.137 --> 44:01.673
YOU GOTTA
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.341
UM.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.343
ME AND MY BROTHER
WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT

44:05.410 --> 44:09.214
ON THE DAY
OF HIS GRADUATION.
AND, UM,

44:09.280 --> 44:11.783
SOME DRUNK DRIVER RAN
THROUGH A RED LIGHT
AND--

44:11.850 --> 44:14.052
HEY, TERRI!
COME HERE.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.054
UH, LOOK, TERRI,
I'VE GOTTA GO.

44:16.121 --> 44:17.923
I'VE GOTTA MEET
SOMEBODY.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.058
LOOK, SAY HI
TO DENISE FOR ME.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.164
- HEY.
- HEY, WAS THAT JAY
RUNNING OFF?

44:26.231 --> 44:28.834
- YEAH.
- FIGURES. WHAT, WAS HE
MACKING ON YOU?

44:28.900 --> 44:30.435
NOT THAT I COULD TELL.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.038
WELL, COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS,
'CAUSE I KNOW HIS GAME.

44:33.104 --> 44:34.605
HE LIKES TO HIT
ON NICE GIRLS.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.375
AND BABY, YOU--
YOU GOT A LOCK
ON THAT ONE.

44:37.442 --> 44:39.377
- WHAT?
- ( laughs )
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

44:39.444 --> 44:42.313
LOOK AT YOUR
HAIR, YOUR CLOTHES,
THE WAY YOU TALK.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.549
YOU'RE LIKE SOME KINDA
RETRO BRADY BUNCHER.

44:44.615 --> 44:47.418
( mocking )
SHOOT, I'M NOT EVEN
TRYING TO HEAR THAT.

44:47.485 --> 44:49.220
( both laugh )

44:49.287 --> 44:51.356
OKAY, THAT WAS CUTE.
MY BAD.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.294
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD DO THIS.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.864
YEAH. MY TEACHERS
ARE ALWAYS HARPING ABOUT
HOW IT'S BAD FOR ME.

44:58.930 --> 45:02.367
YOU KNOW, HOW I'M GONNA
LOSE MY EAR. BUT I JUST LIKE
HOW IT SOUNDS IN HERE.

45:02.433 --> 45:04.369
( amplified jazz violin )

45:23.121 --> 45:25.190
( cell phone ringing )

45:34.665 --> 45:36.534
- HELLO.
- OH HI, HONEY.

45:36.601 --> 45:38.536
UM, DAD WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

45:38.603 --> 45:40.839
UM, SIMON, PICK UP.

45:42.908 --> 45:44.442
HEY, SWEETHEART.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.177
How's it going?
Hanging in there?

45:46.244 --> 45:49.680
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
- SURE DO MISS YOU.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.850
I MISS YOU TOO, DAD.
( police siren blares )

45:53.819 --> 45:57.522
- WHAT WAS THAT?
IT SOUNDED LIKE A SIREN.
- UH, NO, NO. IT'S NOTHING.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.225
WELL, IT DIDN'T
SOUND LIKE NOTHING.
IT SOUNDED PRETTY CLOSE.

46:01.927 --> 46:04.329
THE NEIGHBORS ARE
OUT OF TOWN AND THEIR ALARM
KEEPS GOING OFF

46:04.395 --> 46:06.397
SO, I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO THE POLICE, OKAY?

46:06.464 --> 46:09.034
- I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- OKAY, BYE, HONEY.

46:09.100 --> 46:11.469
- UH, WHAT, TERRI, WAIT.
- ( dial tone )

46:11.536 --> 46:12.904
TERRI?

46:14.039 --> 46:17.108
( sighs )
I'M GONNA LOSE IT.

46:17.175 --> 46:18.944
Terri:
* KING OF KINGS

46:19.010 --> 46:21.112
* FOREVER AND EVER

46:21.179 --> 46:22.680
* HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH

46:22.747 --> 46:24.682
* AND LORD OF LORDS

46:24.749 --> 46:26.484
* FOREVER AND EVER

46:26.551 --> 46:29.320
- * HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH
- YES.

46:29.387 --> 46:30.788
* KING OF KINGS

46:30.856 --> 46:32.790
* FOREVER AND EVER

46:32.858 --> 46:34.492
* HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH

46:34.559 --> 46:36.527
( voice cracking )
* AND LORD OF LORDS...

46:36.594 --> 46:40.798
( sighs )
I CAN NEVER GET THAT NOTE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

46:40.866 --> 46:44.836
- I CAN.
- PROBLEM, LADIES?

46:44.903 --> 46:47.538
YEAH, I THINK THAT
SOME OF US MAYBE NEED
TO PRACTICE THIS

46:47.605 --> 46:50.341
- A LITTLE BIT MORE
OUTSIDE OF CLASS.
- MEOW!

46:50.408 --> 46:52.543
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
WORRY ABOUT THAT, HMM?

46:52.610 --> 46:55.013
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
DONE FOR THE DAY.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.815
GO ON.
GET OUTTA HERE.

46:57.883 --> 46:59.117
MS. FLETCHER.

47:00.986 --> 47:03.588
( sighs )

47:03.654 --> 47:04.822
OKAY, I GIVE UP.

47:04.890 --> 47:07.692
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE GIRL ON THE DVD?

47:07.758 --> 47:09.460
EXCUSE ME?

47:09.527 --> 47:13.131
THE LIVELY, FUNNY,
TALENTED GIRL, WHAT DID
YOU DO WITH HER?

47:13.198 --> 47:15.400
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

47:15.466 --> 47:17.135
I SENT MY SONGS ON A CD.

47:17.202 --> 47:20.371
NO, THERE WAS ALSO A DVD.

47:20.438 --> 47:22.373
IT CAME IN LATE.
WE ALMOST DIDN'T SEE IT.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.842
BUT IT'S A BIG PART
OF THE REASON WHY
YOU ARE HERE.

47:24.910 --> 47:26.644
SIT DOWN.
BE COMFORTABLE.

47:26.711 --> 47:29.014
OKAY, MR. TORVALD.
I DID NOT SEND IT.

47:29.080 --> 47:32.383
- I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
- NO? WELL.

47:32.450 --> 47:36.654
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO ONE INTERESTING,
FASCINATING LADY.

47:36.721 --> 47:38.589
MAYBE YOU'LL BE INSPIRED.

47:38.656 --> 47:40.525
I KNOW WE WERE.

47:45.330 --> 47:49.434
Terri's my sister.
And, uh, she's my favorite
person in the whole world.

47:49.500 --> 47:53.204
She like a challenge.
She thrives when she's pushed.

47:53.271 --> 47:55.073
And the people
who can do that,

47:55.140 --> 47:56.674
They don't live
in Flagstaff.

47:56.741 --> 47:59.710
Terri deserves a chance
to learn from the best.

47:59.777 --> 48:01.246
She's already good.

48:01.312 --> 48:03.448
But she could be great.

48:03.514 --> 48:05.383
( silent )

48:22.367 --> 48:24.702
If you let her in,
you won't be disappointed.

48:24.769 --> 48:26.637
( silent )

48:35.180 --> 48:37.482
- ( crying )
- HEY, TERRI?

48:38.916 --> 48:40.051
TERRI!

48:45.823 --> 48:48.493
TERRI.
ARE YOU OKAY?

48:48.559 --> 48:51.329
PLEASE.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST SOME
WEIRDO MISFIT THING.

49:10.915 --> 49:12.083
NO.

49:22.693 --> 49:26.497
THE SHOW'S OVER.
OKAY, YOU CAN GO NOW.

49:26.564 --> 49:29.534
LOOK, WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.835
( sobbing )

49:30.901 --> 49:35.706
- IT'S COPPING OUT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

49:35.773 --> 49:37.508
SAME AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

49:37.575 --> 49:41.346
THE MUSIC THING.
DUCKING A SUMMER JOB.

49:41.412 --> 49:43.381
I MEAN HERE IN MY DOORWAY.

49:43.448 --> 49:45.850
LOOK, COME ON.
LET'S JUST GET OUTTA HERE.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.085
( sighing )

49:47.152 --> 49:48.453
COME ON.
LET'S JUST GO.

49:49.954 --> 49:52.157
THE BAG ISN'T WALKING AWAY.

49:53.124 --> 49:55.193
HOW DO I KNOW YOU WON'T?

50:02.400 --> 50:04.335
I WAS SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.

50:04.402 --> 50:08.239
AND HE DIED AND I DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW?

50:08.306 --> 50:10.975
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

50:11.042 --> 50:14.145
BUT I MISS HIM.

50:14.212 --> 50:17.515
THE SECOND I START TO FEEL
LIKE I'M ENJOYING MYSELF,

50:17.582 --> 50:20.685
THIS VOICE COMES
INSIDE MY HEAD AND...

50:20.751 --> 50:22.120
IT'S LIKE,

50:22.187 --> 50:25.456
"HOW CAN YOU BE HAVING
A GOOD TIME WHEN PAUL IS DEAD?"

50:25.523 --> 50:29.627
YOU CAN'T BLAME
YOURSELF LIKE THAT.

50:29.694 --> 50:32.029
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

50:32.097 --> 50:34.031
IT WAS MY FAULT.

50:34.099 --> 50:35.600
I GOT HIM TO SNEAK OUT.

50:37.502 --> 50:38.803
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE RISKED IT.

50:38.869 --> 50:42.807
LOOK, TERRI.
SOME IDIOT RAN A RED LIGHT.

50:42.873 --> 50:45.210
IT WAS BAD LUCK.

50:45.276 --> 50:50.748
MESSED UP TIMING.
THAT'S ALL.

50:50.815 --> 50:52.517
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

50:54.552 --> 50:59.023
Jay:
LOOK, I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

50:59.090 --> 51:01.092
BUT I DO KNOW
FROM EXPERIENCE

51:01.159 --> 51:04.529
BACKING DOWN CAN
BECOME A WAY OF LIFE.

51:04.595 --> 51:05.763
DON'T LEAVE.

51:05.830 --> 51:09.134
SCREW THE PRESSURE.
SCREW THE SCHOLARSHIP.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.969
I MEAN, DO YOUR OWN THING
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

51:12.036 --> 51:13.838
AND GET WHAT
YOU CAME HERE FOR.

51:13.904 --> 51:17.108
- THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.
- BUT JAY, I'M LYING
TO PEOPLE.

51:17.175 --> 51:18.776
I MEAN, I HAD TO LIE
TO GET HERE.

51:18.843 --> 51:21.279
SO WHAT.
YOU GOT HERE.

51:21.346 --> 51:23.914
IT'S NOT
SUPPOSE TO BE EASY.

51:23.981 --> 51:28.453
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU DID
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

51:28.519 --> 51:31.622
WHY DO YOU CARE
SO MUCH?

51:31.689 --> 51:33.558
I DON'T KNOW.

51:39.697 --> 51:40.765
I LIKE YOU.

51:43.434 --> 51:47.372
AND ROBIN FITS
INTO THAT, HOW?

51:47.438 --> 51:49.740
WE MET HERE
LAST YEAR AND...

51:49.807 --> 51:52.243
WE HAD A THING
FOR A WHILE.

51:52.310 --> 51:54.745
THAT'S ALL OVER.

51:54.812 --> 51:57.248
DOES SHE KNOW THAT?

51:57.315 --> 51:59.016
YEAH, WELL...

51:59.083 --> 52:01.085
SOME PEOPLE HANG ON

52:01.152 --> 52:03.221
WHEN THEY SHOULD
JUST LET GO.

52:16.100 --> 52:18.569
* LA-LA-LA-LA-
LA-LA-LA-LA *

52:18.636 --> 52:20.938
( out of tune )
* LA-LA-LA-LA

52:21.005 --> 52:23.341
* LA-LA-LA-LA

52:24.309 --> 52:25.510
* LA-LA.

52:27.278 --> 52:28.713
Torvald:
THANK YOU.

52:28.779 --> 52:31.182
OKAY, I'M NOT DOING THIS
TO TORTURE YOU PEOPLE.

52:31.249 --> 52:32.817
JUST THINK OF THIS
AS A MIDTERM WORTH,

52:32.883 --> 52:35.786
OH, HALF YOUR GRADE.
MS. FLETCHER?

52:35.853 --> 52:36.787
PLEASE?

52:40.325 --> 52:44.395
* LA-LA-LA-LA-LA

52:44.462 --> 52:48.533
* LA-LA-LA-LA-LA

52:48.599 --> 52:52.036
* LA-LA-LA-LA-LA...
( voice cracks )

52:52.102 --> 52:55.273
* LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA

52:55.340 --> 52:57.041
* HA-HO

52:57.107 --> 52:59.344
* O-O-O-O

52:59.410 --> 53:02.179
* O-A-A-A-A-A

53:02.247 --> 53:05.316
* O-O-O-O-O-O

53:05.383 --> 53:08.118
* HEY-A-A-A
YEAH-E-A *

53:08.185 --> 53:10.655
( cheering )

53:12.557 --> 53:14.592
YEAH!
THAT WAS GREAT.

53:16.794 --> 53:19.129
- ALL RIGHT, YOU TAKE
THE TOP OF THE FOURTH.
- AWESOME.

53:19.196 --> 53:21.432
- I WAS TALKING
TO TERRI. BING!
- ( students laughing )

53:21.499 --> 53:23.901
OKAY, LET'S TAKE
THE THIRD PART FROM THE TOP.

53:23.968 --> 53:26.337
IS EVERYBODY READY?

53:26.404 --> 53:28.506
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

53:28.573 --> 53:32.343
* HALLELUJAH,
HALLELUJAH *

53:32.410 --> 53:34.312
* HALLELUJAH,
HALLELUJAH *

53:34.379 --> 53:35.846
* HALLELUJAH.

53:37.882 --> 53:38.816
HEY.

53:41.386 --> 53:42.587
WHAT'S THIS?

53:42.653 --> 53:45.523
I THINK MAYBE GIORDANNI
IS NOT FOR YOU.

53:45.590 --> 53:48.859
WE TRY SOMETHING
ELSE, HMM?

53:48.926 --> 53:51.662
YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE
THE THOUGHT, MR. WESSON,

53:51.729 --> 53:54.932
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'D REALLY LIKE TO STICK
TO THE OLD ONE.

53:54.999 --> 53:58.269
I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER
TODAY AND I WANNA SEE
IF I CAN KEEP IT UP.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.413
THANKS.

54:08.479 --> 54:10.715
( metronome clicking )

54:13.284 --> 54:16.253
( singing in Italian )

54:34.905 --> 54:35.840
HMM.

54:44.815 --> 54:48.052
* YOU AND ME

54:48.118 --> 54:51.689
* CAN'T YOU SEE

54:51.756 --> 54:55.826
* HOW OUR HEARTS ARE ONE?

55:01.131 --> 55:02.900
( sighs )

55:02.967 --> 55:04.335
WHA--

55:04.402 --> 55:06.371
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- OH, UH...

55:06.437 --> 55:07.972
JUST...

55:08.038 --> 55:10.475
THE DOOR WAS OPEN.
I JUST HEARD YOU PLAYING.

55:13.378 --> 55:14.545
OH, DON'T STOP.

55:14.612 --> 55:16.547
NO, IT'S, UM,
IT'S OKAY.

55:16.614 --> 55:19.183
I WAS, UM,
I WAS FINISHED ANYWAY.

55:19.249 --> 55:20.385
WHATEVER.

55:23.253 --> 55:24.722
TERRI, WAIT.

55:24.789 --> 55:27.925
- ( sighs )
- I'M SORRY, I'M JUST...

55:27.992 --> 55:31.295
A BIT WEIRD
WHEN I'M WRITING.

55:31.362 --> 55:33.130
- WHY?
- WELL...

55:33.197 --> 55:35.533
I-IT'S JUST MY LYRICS,
THEY'RE REALLY LAME.

55:35.600 --> 55:37.535
I MEAN, WHEN I SING THEM.

55:37.602 --> 55:39.704
AND I WANT THEM TO MEAN
SO MUCH MORE, BUT--

55:39.770 --> 55:41.472
WELL, I'VE BEEN WRITING SONGS
SINCE I WAS A KID.

55:41.539 --> 55:43.408
BUT MY ARRANGEMENTS
SOUND LIKE

55:43.474 --> 55:48.679
- SOME CHEESY SATURDAY MORNING
CARTOON OR SOMETHING.
- ( chuckles )

55:48.746 --> 55:51.315
- PLAY SOMETHING FOR ME.
- OH, UM.

55:51.382 --> 55:54.419
- IT'S NOT READY YET.
- COME ON, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THAT...

55:54.485 --> 55:57.221
( English accent )
"YOU'VE GOT TO DO YOUR OWN THING
ON YOUR OWN TERMS"

55:57.287 --> 55:59.924
JUNK THAT YOU GAVE
ME THE OTHER DAY?

55:59.990 --> 56:01.859
COME ON.

56:01.926 --> 56:03.628
OKAY.

56:05.496 --> 56:08.899
* YOU AND ME
CAN'T YOU SEE *

56:08.966 --> 56:12.470
* HOW OUR HEARTS
ARE ONE? *

56:12.537 --> 56:14.472
* PLEASE BELIEVE

56:14.539 --> 56:17.675
* AND DON'T DECEIVE

56:17.742 --> 56:21.746
* NOW OUR JOURNEY'S
JUST BEGUN *

56:21.812 --> 56:24.615
* THE SUNLIGHT
IN YOUR HAIR *

56:24.682 --> 56:27.785
* MAKES MY HEART JUMP
IN THE AIR... *

56:29.754 --> 56:31.989
- COME ON.
- ( laughing )
OKAY, WAIT.

56:33.491 --> 56:35.493
I LIKE THE MUSIC A LOT.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.695
- YEAH?
- OKAY? BUT WHAT
ABOUT THIS?

56:39.396 --> 56:40.931
- YEAH, I LIKE THAT.
- OKAY?

56:40.998 --> 56:43.033
IT'S VERY COOL.

56:43.100 --> 56:45.803
* WHEN IT COMES TO RAP,
YOU DON'T EVEN WRITE
YOUR STUFF *

56:45.870 --> 56:48.105
* YEAH YOU MAKE TRACKS
BUT I MAKE TWICE AS MUCH. *

56:48.172 --> 56:52.477
OH, SPRING, WHEN A YOUNG
MAN'S FANCY TURNS TO LOVE.

56:52.543 --> 56:54.078
- DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT?
- WHAT?

56:54.144 --> 56:56.947
OH, IT'S WEIRD 'CAUSE
THERE'S A HOLE IN MY CHEST

56:57.014 --> 56:59.149
WHERE MY HEART USED TO BE
'CAUSE SOMEONE ELSE

56:59.216 --> 57:03.454
YANKED IT OUT AND SHE
DOESN'T EVEN FRIGGIN' CARE
THAT SHE DID IT.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.923
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE GIRL IN
THE BLACK SWEATSHIRT?

57:05.990 --> 57:07.758
DUDE, SHE'S THE HOTTEST
PLAYER HERE.

57:07.825 --> 57:10.661
I HEARD HER IN THE PRACTICE
ROOMS AND SHE'S FLAWLESS.

57:10.728 --> 57:14.599
WELL, SHE LOOKED AT ME
AND I JUST...

57:16.433 --> 57:19.003
OH, MAN, SNAP.

57:19.069 --> 57:21.472
- FRIEND, YOU'RE HOOKED.
- HOPELESSLY.

57:21.539 --> 57:23.508
HAVE YOU EVER
EVEN TALKED TO HER?

57:23.574 --> 57:26.944
NO, I'M WORKING ON THAT.
SEE, THE PROBLEM IS SHE WON'T
GIVE ME THE TIME OF DAY.

57:27.011 --> 57:30.147
WELL, WHY DON'T I
INTRODUCE YOU GUYS?

57:30.214 --> 57:32.182
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

GIRL EVER?

57:32.249 --> 57:34.384

57:38.422 --> 57:40.257
KIWI SEAL OF APPROVAL.

57:40.324 --> 57:43.193

58:02.179 --> 58:04.281
YOUR NAME?

58:04.348 --> 58:06.450
SLOANE.

58:06.517 --> 58:09.820
I-- I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE
ANY CLASSES TOGETHER
OR ANYTHING, BUT...

58:09.887 --> 58:13.357
UM, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT I'D INTRODUCE MYSELF.

58:13.423 --> 58:14.725
OKAY.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.429
OKAY, SO THERE'S
THIS GUY, RIGHT?

58:19.496 --> 58:22.066

58:22.132 --> 58:26.336
AND HE KINDA

SO WE WERE WONDERING

58:26.403 --> 58:28.806
IF YOU WANTED TO COME
HANG OUT WITH US ON
SATURDAY NIGHT?

58:28.873 --> 58:32.042
KIWI'S A WEIRD NAME.

58:32.109 --> 58:35.212
WHY WOULD HE
HAVE A CRUSH ON ME?
THAT'S STUPID.

58:37.247 --> 58:42.052
UM, I MEAN, SOMETIMES
THERE'S JUST NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

58:42.119 --> 58:44.822
WELL, ANYWAY,

59:02.339 --> 59:04.575
OKAY.

59:04.642 --> 59:06.176

59:50.520 --> 59:51.956
DOING WHAT I CAN
STREET PERFORMING,

59:52.022 --> 59:54.458
WE STILL HAD CRAZY TROUBLE
SCRAPPING UP THE TUITION.

59:54.524 --> 59:58.562
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU
THINK I'M STRESSING
THAT SCHOLARSHIP?

59:58.629 --> 01:00:00.665

- HEY, AUNT NINA.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:34.431
YOUR DAD CALLED,
I DID MY THING.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:37.534
I think he smells a rat.
I don't know how,
I don't know why.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:40.470
BUT YOUR MOTHER JUST CALLED
AND SAID HE IS ON HIS

I'LL STALL HIM AS BEST

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:46.110
OH MY GOD.
WE'RE DEAD.

P.A:
The desert train

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:17.307
( horn blaring )

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.219
Radio:
We're getting a little break
from the 100-plus temperatures

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:31.688
here in the greater
Palm Springs area.

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:34.792
Wind's out of the northeast
at six miles per hour.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:15.499
- HEY.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.666
WHERE IS SHE?

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.468
AH, WELL, UM...

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:21.571
THERE'S SOMETHING

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:39.423
I NEED A DRINK.

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:46.964
( sighs )
SORRY.

01:02:47.031 --> 01:02:49.499
( sighs )
THEY'RE NOT COMING, MAN.
I'M TELLING YOU.

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.903

ALWAYS FASHIONABLY LATE.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:57.842

DON'T WALK AWAY.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.089
HEY, YOU GUYS,
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:16.326

UM, I THINK
YOU SHOULD-- COOL.

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:24.668
Terri:
NO, SERIOUSLY.
I HAD TO PRETEND TO MY DAD

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.471
LIKE I HAD BEEN THERE
THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME,
AND MEANWHILE MY AUNT

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.940
WAS REMODELING HER HOUSE,
SO WHEN I WENT TO GO FIND
THE BATHROOM,

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:31.808
- I WALKED INTO A CLOSET.
- NO WAY.

01:03:31.876 --> 01:03:34.945
- YES WAY.
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE ALL
THOUGHT YOU WERE LIKE SOME

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:38.382
GOODY-TWO-SHOES,
BUT YOU'RE LIKE A FUGITIVE
FROM THE LAW.

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:40.484
( laughs )

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.253
- SPEAKING OF WHICH, FUGITIVE,
WHERE ARE YOU LEADING US TO?
- YOU'LL SEE.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:49.326
( violin playing )

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:02.539
- SHE'S GOOD.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:06.210
THIS ONE, OKAY?

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:10.447
( changes tempo )

01:04:14.118 --> 01:04:17.888
* YOU GOT A SMILE
SO BRIGHT *

01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:21.658

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:33.270
- NO, NO, NO.

OFF MY FEET *

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:36.773
All:
* YOU KNOW YOU COULD
HAVE BEEN SOME PERFUME *

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:42.012
* WELL YOU COULD HAVE BEEN
ANYTHING THAT YOU WANTED TO *

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:44.514
* AND I COULD TELL

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.516
* THE WAY YOU DO
THE THINGS YOU DO *

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.518
* THE WAY YOU DO
THE THINGS YOU DO *

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:50.587

( score replays )

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.306
( saxophone playing )

01:05:44.008 --> 01:05:46.510
Terri:
I LIKE TO COME UP HERE
SOMETIMES TO THINK.

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:50.814
( laughs )
THIS IS REALLY COOL.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.382
I LOVE IT UP HERE.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.418
WISH I HAD A PLACE
TO THINK LIKE THIS.

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:57.021
( laughing )
WELL, YOU PLAY
YOUR CARDS RIGHT,

01:05:57.087 --> 01:05:59.123
MAYBE I'LL SHARE
WITH YOU.

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:01.191
- MAYBE?
- MAYBE.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:06.496
( laughs )
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU
COME UP HERE TO THINK ABOUT.

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:07.631
STUFF.

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:11.635
MY DREAMS.

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:14.871
MUSIC.
THE FUTURE.

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:17.041
IF I HAVE ONE.

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:19.409
( saxophone playing )

01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:23.213
( laughs )

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.316
COME ON.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.603
TOO FAST?

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.372
NOT READY.

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:51.841
WELL... COOL.

01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:53.943
I MEAN I LIKE YOU.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.745
A LOT.

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:58.315
YEAH, I LIKE YOU TOO.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.955
I WAS THINKING OF THAT SONG
WE WERE WORKING ON
THE OTHER DAY.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.491
UM-HMM.

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:11.027
I THINK WE SHOULD
DO IT FOR OUR FINAL
PERFORMANCE PIECE.

01:07:11.095 --> 01:07:12.462
YOU SING.
I'LL PLAY.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.631
WE COULD SPLIT
THE SCHOLARSHIP

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:17.801
AND WE COULD
WRITE SOMETHING
REALLY MEANINGFUL.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.705
- OKAY?
- DEAL.

01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:28.745
DO YOU WANT
TO TRY THAT AGAIN?

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.046
WHAT?

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:55.672
( pop music playing )

01:07:57.607 --> 01:08:00.310
* SOMETHING IN THE WAY
YOU THROW YOUR HAIR *

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:02.446
* BACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:05.282
* SOMETHING IN THE WAY
YOU SMILE *

01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:07.684
* WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
MY WAY *

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.419
* I'VE GOT NO CONCERNS

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:12.456
* THE DAYS ARE LONG
AND THE NIGHTS GET COLDER *

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:15.759
* BECAUSE IT'S THIS
I'VE GOT TO TRY *

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.426
* ON YOU, HONEY

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:20.229
* I AIN'T NEVER WISHIN'

01:08:38.182 --> 01:08:40.116
( singer singing
out of tune )

01:08:40.184 --> 01:08:43.118
( crowd booing )

01:08:43.187 --> 01:08:45.255
- BOO!
- YOU SUCK!

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.493
TOUGH CROWD.

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:51.495
- YEAH.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.096
I'M GONNA GO SEE
IF WE CAN GET ONTO
THE LIST TO PERFORM.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.899
WHAT?
JAY, NO.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.301
HEY LOOK, WE CAN
PRACTICE FOREVER,
BUT SOONER OR LATER

01:08:58.368 --> 01:08:59.736
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO IT.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:02.005
Patron:
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:06.443
* HEY-EY.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:08.612
ALL RIGHT,

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:10.613
STANLEY WILSON,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.616
LET'S GIVE A BIG HAND
TO STANLEY WILSON.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:14.818
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?!
- YOU SUCK, MAN!

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:17.220
GOOD JOB.

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.256
- I'M SO NERVOUS.
- WELL, LOOK, JUST--

01:09:19.323 --> 01:09:22.225
PICTURE THE AUDIENCE NAKED.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:23.593
OKAY, BAD IDEA.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.330
ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
WE HAVE TERRI AND JAY.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.163
NOW, IT IS THEIR FIRST TIME
HERE AT THE BLUE MOON,

01:09:28.232 --> 01:09:31.201
SO LET'S GIVE

TERRI AND JAY, EVERYONE.

01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:33.337
( applauding )

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:44.981
( clears throat )

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:48.785
* THERE'S A LIGHT IN ME

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.354
* AND--

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.957
- LET ME START OVER.
- COME ON, SING SOMETHING!

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.626
* THERE'S A LIGHT IN ME

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.663
- HEY, TURN AROUND.

01:10:01.465 --> 01:10:03.467
LOOK, IT'S OKAY.

01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:06.936
SORRY.

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:13.610
* THERE'S A LIGHT IN ME

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:18.047

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:20.550
* I CAN'T HELP--

01:10:28.292 --> 01:10:31.428
- Terri: PAUL!
- ( crowd mumbling )

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:38.768
TERRI! TERRI!

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.570
TERRI, WAIT, WAIT!

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:43.740
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M FINE.

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:47.377
I SAW--
I JUST WASN'T READY.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:52.882
I-- I WAS GONNA WAIT.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.218
BUT, UM,

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:57.053
THIS IS FOR YOU.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.588
PAUL'S CROSS.

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:24.914
( alarm beeping )

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:26.850
( sighs )

01:11:30.354 --> 01:11:33.156
( mumbles )

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:38.094
* THE KINGDOM
OF THIS WORLD *

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:41.097
* HE IS BECOME

01:11:41.164 --> 01:11:44.267
* THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD

01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:46.269
* AND OF HIS CHRIST...

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:50.106
* AND OF HIS CHRIST.

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:52.842
GOOD. NICE.

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:55.244
IMPROVING.
WE'VE GOT 10
MINUTES LEFT.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:58.382
I WANT TO RUN
THE THIRD SECTION.
HAS ANYBODY SEEN TERRI?

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:01.485
I CAN SING THE PART,
MR. TORVALD, I KNOW IT
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:03.753
IT'S TERRI'S SOLO,
SO LETS WAIT FOR HER.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.391
BUT SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE.
AND IT'S NOT LIKE SHE CAN
SING IT ANYWAY.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.626
TERRI'S WORKED HARD FOR IT.
SHE DESERVES IT.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:13.129
- NO, I DESERVE THIS PART!
- ( crowd gasps )

01:12:13.196 --> 01:12:14.864
Student:
STOP IT. JEEZ.

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:18.502
HA-HA.

01:12:20.303 --> 01:12:22.672
WELL I GUESS YOU HAVE
A NEW FAVORITE NOW!

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:24.808
( door slams )

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:26.810
HEY.

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:30.246
( crying )
COME ON.

01:12:30.313 --> 01:12:32.382
WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:38.455
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:12:38.522 --> 01:12:41.791
I DON'T-- I DON'T SEE
HOW THINGS CAN JUST GO
FROM BEING SO GREAT

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.694
ONE SUMMER TO TURN
TO SUCH CRAP THE NEXT.

01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:50.700
I'M SORRY, ROBIN.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:53.036
CAN WE TALK?

01:12:54.638 --> 01:12:56.673
I MEAN, PRIVATELY?

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:05.649
HEY, MR. TORVALD.
I'M SORRY I MISSED CLASS.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.216
WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

01:13:07.283 --> 01:13:10.386
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

01:13:10.454 --> 01:13:13.590
- WHAT?
- IF YOU MISSED MY CLASS,

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:15.391
YOU MUST BE DEATHLY ILL.

01:13:15.459 --> 01:13:18.562
IT'S TOO BAD
BECAUSE WE WERE GONNA
WORK ON YOUR SOLO TODAY.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:24.367
- I'M NOT READY FOR A SOLO.
- YES, YOU ARE.

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:27.771
DON'T YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU'VE IMPROVED
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE?

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:30.339
OKAY, BUT THERE
ARE MUCH BETTER SINGERS
HERE, MR. TORVALD.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.341
I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.844
WE'LL TRY IT AGAIN TOMORROW.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.513
LOOK, TERRI,

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.982
THERE'S PEOPLE
IN THE CLASS WHO ARE
DESPERATE TO DO THIS SOLO,

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:42.652
SO IF YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE WORK,

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:44.788
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING HERE?

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:47.791
( door shuts )

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:51.394
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.
YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO BE WITH ME.

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:53.196
LOOK, JUST--

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.464
TAKE IT EASY.

01:13:58.001 --> 01:14:00.537
WORSE THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED, RIGHT?

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:02.539
YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.073
JUST NOT TO ME.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.644
- I ALWAYS GET MY WAY.
- (chuckles )

01:14:10.313 --> 01:14:13.517
- IS THAT A BAD THING TO SAY?
- WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE, YEAH.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:18.021
BUT I THOUGHT YOU LIKED BAD.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:21.157
MAYBE A LITTLE BAD?

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:24.628
COME ON, WE GOT ALONG
REALLY WELL LAST SUMMER,
DIDN'T WE?

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.630
PEOPLE CHANGE, ROBIN.

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.965
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON
I WAS LAST SUMMER.

01:14:29.032 --> 01:14:30.433
NEITHER ARE YOU.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.968
I DON'T KNOW.

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:34.904
I THINK WE CAN BE
THOSE TWO PEOPLE AGAIN.
DON'T YOU?

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:40.710
( students chatting )

01:14:42.679 --> 01:14:46.482
- HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN JAY?
- UH, HEADING TO THE PRACTICE
ROOM, I THINK.

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:50.554
I THINK I KNOW THE PROBLEM.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:54.824
I'M BAD.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.161
BUT I CAN BE BETTER.

01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:09.005
( gasps )

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:10.674
TERRI, WAIT!
TERRI!

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:15.879
TERRI!
TERRI, WAIT!

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.213
TERRI!

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.082
- WAIT.
- JERK!

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:21.785
TERRI!

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:26.122
- JAY?
- STAY AWAY FROM ME!
TERRI!

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.226
( crying )

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.001
STUPID.

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:59.689
* I DON'T KNOW YOUR FACE

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:02.626
* NO MORE

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.430
* OR FEEL THE TOUCH

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:10.566
* THAT I ADORE

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:18.274
* I DON'T KNOW YOUR FACE

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:21.577
* NO MORE

01:16:22.812 --> 01:16:25.849
* IT'S JUST A PLACE

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:29.052
* I'M LOOKING FOR...

01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:34.523
- TERRI, COME ON, PLEASE.
- SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOU.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.759
JUST BACK OFF.

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:40.630
* WE MIGHT AS WELL
BE LIVING *

01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:44.433
* IN ANOTHER TOWN

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.771
* WE MIGHT AS WELL

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:51.274
* WE MIGHT AS WELL

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.177
* WE MIGHT AS WELL

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:58.381
* BE STRANGERS

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:08.758
* BE STRANGERS

01:17:13.329 --> 01:17:16.465
* FOR ALL I KNOW

01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:21.237
* OF YOU NOW

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:25.675
* FOR ALL I KNOW.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:32.115
AW, HEY.
YOU OKAY?

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.350
IT'S NOTHING.

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:36.352
I'M SORRY IF I WAS HARD
ON YOU THE OTHER DAY.

01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:39.956
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M HERE FOR YOU

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:43.126
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
IF YOU WANT TO TALK.
ANYTHING.

01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:45.995
OKAY?

01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:54.603
HAVE YOU EVER LOST ANYONE?

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.839
YEAH.

01:17:57.807 --> 01:17:59.876
I JUST CAN'T LET THIS GO.

01:17:59.943 --> 01:18:01.745
WELL, YOU'RE AN ARTIST

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:03.880
AND ARTISTS
FEEL THINGS DIFFERENTLY

01:18:03.947 --> 01:18:06.916
THAN REGULAR PEOPLE.

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:09.285
LOOK AT PATSY CLINE OR

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:12.421
BILLIE HOLIDAY.
YOU COULD HEAR IT
IN THEIR VOICE.

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:14.223
OR,

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:18.027
VINCENT VAN GOGH.
CUT OFF HIS EAR, BUT HEY,
HE COULD PAINT.

01:18:18.094 --> 01:18:20.163
VINCENT VAN GOGH
KILLED HIMSELF.

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:22.665
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE.

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:24.233
( laughs )

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.602
HEY, I'M A MUSIC TEACHER,
NOT A SHRINK.

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:29.372
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.340
I GUESS...

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:35.511
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS ARTISTS CONVEY EMOTION.

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:39.849
THEY MAKE AN AUDIENCE FEEL
WHAT THEY'RE FEELING.

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.985
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, RIGHT?

01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:43.987
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.656
TO TAKE WHAT'S IN HERE

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.425
AND PUT IT IN HERE.

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:59.468
- ( pounding at door )
- WHAT THE HELL. WHO IS IT?

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:01.737
IT'S JAY.
LET ME IN!

01:19:01.805 --> 01:19:04.107
- GO AWAY, YOU JACKASS!
- NO, NO, NO!

01:19:04.173 --> 01:19:06.709
I JUST-- PLEASE, I JUST WANT
TO TALK TO TERRI, OKAY?

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:09.745
- JUST LET ME IN.
- HE SOUNDS DRUNK.

01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:11.747
UH, YOU THINK?

01:19:11.815 --> 01:19:14.083
HEY, GIRL,
DO NOT OPEN THAT DOOR.

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.920
OKAY, I'M GONNA MAKE
HIM LEAVE, ALL RIGHT?

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:18.788
JAY, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:20.289
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
- OKAY?

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:22.691
- NO!
- OW!

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:26.562
- THAT HURT A LOT.
- ( sighs )

01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:28.064
- SHH.
- NO, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:29.565
Student:
WHAT'S GOING ON?!

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:31.700
- I SAW YOU
KISSING HER, OKAY?
- NO, NO.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.870
- SHUT UP!
- YOU SHUT UP!

01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:35.738
- Denise: COME ON, TERRI.
- Girl in dorm: I'M TRYING
TO SLEEP!

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:38.942
SH-- I WASN'T KISSING HER.
SHE WAS-- SHE WAS KISSING ME.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:41.677
OH NO.
HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY
TO GO THERE, PLEASE.

01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:43.246
I'M SURE THAT MAKES
A LOT OF SENSE, JAY,

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:45.448
- WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK.
- TERRI,

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:47.250
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HER.

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:50.253
- I CARE ABOUT YOU.
- BOY, WHO YOU TRYING TO PLAY?

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:54.557
- TERRI?
- DENISE, JUST CHILL OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.292
LOOK, TERRI,

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:58.094
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

01:19:58.161 --> 01:20:01.597
- YOU KNOW I DO.
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

01:20:01.664 --> 01:20:03.532
WHY WOULD YOU DRINK?

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:09.238
BECAUSE, BECAUSE I'M--
I'M WORTHLESS.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:12.608
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T EVEN TRY AND GIVE ME
THAT SELF-PITY THING, OKAY?

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.911
TERRI, LOOK.
Y'ALL NEED TO RELOCATE.

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:17.580

YOU HAVE TO HELP ME
GET HIM UP TO THE ROOF.

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:24.053
THIS IS TOO MUCH
DRAMA FOR ME.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.055
- SHH-HH.
- I'M FINE.

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:28.724
YOU'RE NOT FINE, OKAY?

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.326
OH WOW!

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:34.063
I LOVE THIS ROOF!

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:38.734
OH!

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:40.736
I'M SPINNING.

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:43.439
HELP HIM!

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.441
OH MY GOD.

THANK YOU.

01:20:49.812 --> 01:20:52.515
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:53.883
I'M SURE YOU DON'T.

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:57.753
* IN A MOMENT

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:01.257

SAVE IT.
YOU'RE NOT FORGIVEN YET.

01:21:50.173 --> 01:21:51.540
COME ON, LET'S GO.

01:21:59.182 --> 01:22:01.784
* IN A MOMENT

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:05.454
* EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:08.557
FRANCES!
DO YOU HAVE THE CAR KEYS?

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.694
FRANCES?

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.262
CAR KEYS?

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:17.633

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.580
FRANCES?

IS PRACTICE,

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.220
- SO WE CAN PULL THIS OFF.
- RIGHT.

01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:43.426
HERE'S THE MUSIC.

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:46.962
OKAY, WELL,
LET'S START HERE.

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:49.498
- I WANNA WORK
ON THE BRIDGE.
- OKAY.

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:57.240
* IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT PEOPLE SAY *

01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:01.510
* AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES *

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:06.815

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:08.551
OKAY.

01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:12.621
IT'S NOT--
LET'S, UM, GO AGAIN

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:14.490
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

01:23:14.557 --> 01:23:16.392
- ( playing ragtime )

( laughs )

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:21.264
STOP.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.066
OKAY, FOR REAL THIS TIME.
LET'S GO.

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:31.574
( sighs )

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.276
IT SOUNDED FINE
THE FIRST TIME.

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:36.679
OKAY, BUT "FINE"
IS NOT GOING TO WIN US
THE SCHOLARSHIP.

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.114
OKAY, IT'S GOTTA BE RIGHT.

01:23:38.181 --> 01:23:40.049
AND I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP
UNTIL I NAIL IT.

01:23:40.116 --> 01:23:41.584
IT'LL DRIVE ME NUTS.

01:23:43.652 --> 01:23:46.155
* IT DOESN'T MATTER--
IT DOESN'T MATTER *

01:23:46.222 --> 01:23:49.592
* IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES *

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:55.098
* BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
AND YOU'LL FLY HIGH. *

01:23:55.164 --> 01:23:57.800
WHAT?
YOU DID WHAT?

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.435
SHE GOT ACCEPTED, SIMON.

01:23:59.502 --> 01:24:01.170
OUT OF ALL THE APPLICANTS
IN AMERICA,

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:03.506
OUR TERRI GOT IN.

01:24:03.572 --> 01:24:06.242
YOU MEAN SHE'S BEEN THERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

01:24:06.309 --> 01:24:07.843
- DID YOU HEAR ME?
- YOU-- YOU LIED TO ME?

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:10.213
- DID YOU HEAR?
OUR DAUGHTER...
- YOU AND NINA?

01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:14.583

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:24.627
PAUL!

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:29.865
TERRI'S SINGING AGAIN.
WHY DOESN'T THIS MATTER TO YOU?

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:33.302
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
IS WRONG WITH YOU, FRANCES?

01:24:33.369 --> 01:24:36.705
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:38.241
WE JUST LOST OUR SON.

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:42.077
WE WERE LOSING THE ONLY
CHILD WE HAVE LEFT.

01:24:42.145 --> 01:24:44.012
I'M NOT GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.382
THAT'S MY POINT.

01:24:46.449 --> 01:24:49.852
SHE'S JUST A CHILD.
SHE'S OUR CHILD.

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.188
AND HOW CAN I PROTECT HER
IF SHE'S NOT HERE?

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:55.724
I WANT HER HOME.

01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:57.660

THIS PLACE
IS THE SCARIEST,
HARDEST

01:29:46.849 --> 01:29:49.384
BEST THING
THAT HAS EVER
HAPPENED TO ME,

01:29:49.452 --> 01:29:51.153
NO MATTER

OKAY, I DID THIS

YOU CAN TAKE ME HOME
IF YOU WANT TO, DAD.

01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:24.620
BUT I'M PERFORMING
ANY MINUTE NOW,

01:30:24.687 --> 01:30:28.457
AND IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD
TO ME IF YOU AND MOM WERE
THERE TO SUPPORT ME.

USED TO SAY *

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:47.956
