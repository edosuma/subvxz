WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.713
##

00:22.898 --> 00:24.741
Dangerous? Girl,
please. I'll tell you

00:24.942 --> 00:26.615
what's dangerous... leaving this
project till the last minute,

00:26.818 --> 00:27.944
losing my scholarship,

00:28.153 --> 00:29.871
and never working for Chanel.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.578
Oof.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.582
Girl, I got New Orleans'
finest right here.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.130
(grunts)
Watch where you're going.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.252
(scoffs)

00:43.460 --> 00:45.007
That's a choice.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.173
Do you think I'm pretty?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.305
No. I think you're crazy.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.179
(screaming)

00:54.388 --> 00:58.985
Stop... hands up! Now!

00:59.184 --> 01:00.310
Hold it.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.772
Drop the weapon!

01:14.157 --> 01:16.376
What?

01:21.373 --> 01:22.716
Oh, no, no, no.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.759
Oh.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.198
Nothing's coming to me.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.329
Well, then, try again.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.160
I've been trying for two hours

01:58.368 --> 01:59.790
and all I've gotten
is a migraine.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.339
What if my powers are slipping?

02:02.539 --> 02:05.088
A migraine's good. Pain's good.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.090
It's how you build muscles. Just

02:07.294 --> 02:09.045
find something that just guts
you and do it over and over

02:09.253 --> 02:12.474
again. That's how Chas learned
how to cook, isn't it, Chas?

02:12.674 --> 02:17.100
I've got the burn marks to prove
it... well, metaphorically.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.647
What is that thing, anyway?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.975
A zoetrope. Belonged
to Queen Victoria.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.652
Her court magician used to
use it on his séance guests

02:23.852 --> 02:25.445
To induce a hypnotic state.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.944
- Does it work?
- Uh, the wheel was stuck, but...

02:28.148 --> 02:31.027
Ah. Result.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.111
Gather round, it's story time.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.507
Zed?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.964
Zed?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.173
Are you in there?

02:58.804 --> 03:00.477
(gunshot)

03:00.681 --> 03:01.898
This is weird.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.233
WOMAN: Nicely done, Jimmy.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.481
If he comes at you again

03:05.686 --> 03:07.609
when he's drunk,
what do you say?

03:07.813 --> 03:11.067
Slow and smooth.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.366
Smooth is fast.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.864
And squeeze.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.242
What was it? What did you see?

03:20.450 --> 03:22.873
I was...

03:23.078 --> 03:25.376
out in a field, and...

03:25.580 --> 03:28.675
there was a woman teaching
a boy how to shoot a gun.

03:28.875 --> 03:29.922
Hang on.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.880
Incoming.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.011
CONSTANTINE: Back in business.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.513
I was worried Old Faithful
had dried up on us.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.061
Are you talking about the map?

03:39.261 --> 03:40.934
Maybe. But no matter.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.061
Seems we've opened a psychic
connection between you

03:43.265 --> 03:45.518
and the map,
which is what I wanted.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.103
So, Chas, where we headed?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.153
New Orleans, Louisiana.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.116
According to the police report,

03:54.317 --> 03:56.695
this is the spot. A
woman in a surgical mask

03:56.903 --> 03:58.246
stabbed a person to death with

03:58.447 --> 04:00.916
fabric shears yesterday.
Then she vanished.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.593
Spirit of darkness
between matter

04:15.797 --> 04:18.141
and time, cast thy shadow
before me,

04:18.341 --> 04:20.139
reveal forces past.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.893
Blue.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.441
Means there was a spirit
here recently.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.938
Our killer is nonhuman.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.646
Or ex-human, anyway.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.822
Green means
it's in the vicinity.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.195
What about red?

04:34.399 --> 04:35.651
We wouldn't still
be standing here

04:35.859 --> 04:37.486
if this thing
was glowing red, luv.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.911
News said the cop on the scene

04:39.112 --> 04:40.785
fired to subdue the suspect,

04:40.989 --> 04:42.662
but he missed.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.085
Well, if he missed, the bullets
would've hit someone or

04:45.285 --> 04:48.664
something, but these walls,
they seem pretty smooth to me.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.749
(clapping)

04:50.957 --> 04:53.176
Very good.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.845
Uh, think I got a couple
of junior detective badges

04:56.046 --> 04:57.844
back at the station.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.516
Jim Corrigan.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.763
NOLA PD, Homicide.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.264
And you are?

05:02.469 --> 05:03.812
Here to help you, Jimmy boy.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.184
Jimmy?

05:05.388 --> 05:06.264
John Constantine.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.146
This is Chas and Zed.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.352
We're investigating the
occult phenomenon that

05:10.560 --> 05:11.652
happened here last night.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.855
Whoa.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.566
Occult investigators?

05:15.774 --> 05:17.572
(laughs)

05:17.776 --> 05:21.076
Con men don't normally introduce
themselves as con men, that's...

05:21.279 --> 05:22.451
Well, that's novel.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.081
"“Slow is smooth,
smooth is fast."

05:27.327 --> 05:28.453
And squeeze.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.585
Where'd you hear that?

05:30.789 --> 05:33.383
Was that your mother
teaching you to shoot?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.130
What?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.632
Don't mind her, she's, uh,

05:36.837 --> 05:39.590
psychic. So, this stabbing...

05:39.798 --> 05:41.266
Is it your case?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.849
I was on the scene
when it happened.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.556
Fired a full clip
into that killer, but she

05:47.764 --> 05:51.268
just kept going.
Now I'm out of the field.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.149
They think I'm crazy.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.819
Am I?

05:57.023 --> 05:59.321
You're not crazy, Corrigan.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.200
Just up against a
different shade of evil

06:02.404 --> 06:04.782
than the usual New Orleans
street crime. That's, uh,

06:04.990 --> 06:07.118
our department.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.623
Be nice to have an ally in blue.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.255
“Master of the dark arts.“

06:17.711 --> 06:18.963
Wow.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.015
We'll, uh, have a little kip

06:30.223 --> 06:32.225
And then we'll hit it fresh
in the morning.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.523
Where's Chas staying?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.321
He prefers chain hotels.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.023
He's racking up the points.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.405
Thanks. I'll be right back with
both the keys to your rooms.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.452
Thank you.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.653
Two rooms?

06:43.862 --> 06:45.614
Oh, I'm flattered, luv, but

06:45.822 --> 06:47.290
we really ought to keep this
professional, yeah?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.958
Yeah.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.957
Does that mean
you do respect me?

06:51.161 --> 06:54.256
(chuckles)
I respect everyone I sleep with.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.834
But I usually like to get to
know something about them first,

06:57.042 --> 06:58.544
if you know what I mean.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.972
Hmm. If you want to know
something about me, just ask.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.763
Where do you come from?
Why are you running?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.140
And how bad was it that risking
your life on the daily with me

07:08.345 --> 07:10.347
seems like a pleasant
alternative?

07:11.181 --> 07:12.307
Can I offer you

07:12.515 --> 07:14.392
complimentary champagne
in your rooms?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.103
No, thank you.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.689
I don't like champagne.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.736
Now you know something about me.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.341
MAN: Where you headed, son?

07:38.541 --> 07:40.259
The city.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.928
Will you take me?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.971
All right.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.646
What's your name?

07:55.850 --> 07:57.773
Philip.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.111
Are you cold?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.534
Yeah. Cold.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.367
Maybe we could get you
warmed up some.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.372
(elevator bell dings)

08:29.426 --> 08:30.803
Whoa. (chuckles)

08:32.386 --> 08:34.640
That zoetrope
still working on you, eh?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.600
It's not bad.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.645
I'm in the woods.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.982
Just remember what you see, now.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.033
(echoing):
No detail's unimportant.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.455
(horn blaring)

08:58.663 --> 08:59.038
(short shriek)

08:59.247 --> 08:59.622
Hey.

08:59.831 --> 09:00.707
Hey, hey, you all right?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.585
Uh-huh. There was a...

09:03.793 --> 09:05.215
big tree with scars.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.218
(elevator bell dings)

09:07.422 --> 09:09.220
You didn't happen
to see a woman in a

09:09.424 --> 09:11.017
surgical mask
behind the wheel, did you?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.390
No.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.563
You must be picking up
a second signal.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.892
Well, why have one
case when you can have

09:18.099 --> 09:19.897
two with twice the trouble, eh?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.899
Where's that copper's card?

09:22.103 --> 09:24.276
I've an accident to report.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.613
You nervous?

09:27.817 --> 09:29.660
I just want to get out of here.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.623
Will you take me to the city?

09:35.950 --> 09:38.419
Yeah, I'll take you to the city.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.714
(light thump)

09:40.914 --> 09:42.757
Just a branch.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.755
So, uh, anyone

09:44.959 --> 09:46.757
waiting for you there, Philip?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.258
In the city?

09:48.463 --> 09:50.386
No, sir.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.308
You sure?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.261
No one's waiting on you?

09:57.514 --> 09:58.390
(gasps)

09:58.598 --> 09:59.599
(tires screech)

10:05.730 --> 10:08.233
(grunting)

10:12.278 --> 10:14.155
(gurgling)

10:21.788 --> 10:24.962
You said you would
get me to the city.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.504
Help me.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.133
Help me.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.107
Police scanner said it should be

10:41.307 --> 10:44.777
right about...

10:44.978 --> 10:46.321
here.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.533
Well, you might want
to keep the car running, mate.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.950
What are you gonna use?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.369
The Interpol bit?
Paranormal division?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.743
I thought
I'd just wipe his mind.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.540
I got this one.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.038
Step back, ma'am.

11:03.246 --> 11:03.997
My sister.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.878
She was supposed to be home by
now, and she's not answering

11:06.082 --> 11:07.880
her phone. And then I heard
there was a crash and...

11:08.084 --> 11:08.880
(gasps)
Oh, my God. That's her car.

11:09.085 --> 11:09.881
Ma'am.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.635
It's okay. There was no woman
in the car. It was a man.

11:12.839 --> 11:13.806
Are you sure?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.008
You see, I told you, luv.
She probably just forgot

11:15.216 --> 11:16.433
to charge her cell phone.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.640
That poor man.
What happened to him?

11:21.848 --> 11:24.601
It's hard to say. EMTs pulled
the driver out of the wreck

11:24.809 --> 11:27.358
and kept asking about
a hitchhiker. "Where's Philip?“"

11:27.562 --> 11:28.814
There was no one around.
Driver died

11:29.022 --> 11:30.490
in the ambo. Third time

11:30.690 --> 11:32.112
in two weeks
I've had to babysit an accident

11:32.317 --> 11:33.113
around this tree.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.114
Well, that's strange.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.196
It's not a blind corner, and
the road's in good condition.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.202
(tires screech)

11:38.406 --> 11:40.204
Well, Jim Corrigan.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.375
You'll want to hear this.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.543
You're under arrest.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.415
What the bloody hell for?

11:43.620 --> 11:44.337
Anyone who calls

11:44.537 --> 11:46.164
the police about an accident
before it happens

11:46.372 --> 11:48.374
isn't a psychic...
He's a murderer.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.880
Ah. (chuckles)

11:50.084 --> 11:52.052
You two, divide
and conquer. Zed, dig

11:52.253 --> 11:54.972
into the bail fund.
Chas, patrol downtown. Keep our

11:55.173 --> 11:56.720
not-so-friendly ghost
from killing again.

11:56.925 --> 11:57.721
You got it.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.223
You three are some act.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.725
Yeah. Well, it's no act,
super cop.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.399
See, the police, they're looking for a
living killer in that alleyway stabbing,

12:04.599 --> 12:05.100
and they're not gonna find it.

12:05.308 --> 12:05.854
Uh-huh.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.436
Based on what I saw
in the alleyway

12:07.644 --> 12:09.317
and out here on this road,
you got two perps

12:09.520 --> 12:11.568
on the loose, and they're
very possibly dead. Or undead.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.572
Can't believe
I gave you the time of day.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.904
Out here you're looking for a
dead hitchhiker, name of Philip.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.330
He's causing accidents.
Three of them so far.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.077
And that stabbing,

12:21.282 --> 12:23.080
I'll bet it wasn't
the only death by scissors.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.501
Instead of looking at lineups,

12:24.702 --> 12:26.295
You need to be looking
at obituaries.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.715
Get in the car, con man.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.132
Just check your bloody reports.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.630
You'll see I'm right.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.177
Sir.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.308
You need to get out of there!

12:42.512 --> 12:44.640
Watch out!

12:48.059 --> 12:49.356
Do you think I'm pretty?

12:49.560 --> 12:50.903
Yeah, you're pretty.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.321
How 'bout now?

12:52.522 --> 12:55.196
Am I pretty now?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.902
Am I pretty now?!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.657
Yes. You're pretty.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.863
Then why don't I make you pretty
like me?

13:01.072 --> 13:03.495
(grunting, shouting)

13:06.035 --> 13:07.082
(screeches)

13:07.287 --> 13:10.791
(shouting)

13:10.999 --> 13:13.422
(panting)

13:24.387 --> 13:27.231
(door opens)

13:27.432 --> 13:29.025
(door shuts)

13:32.020 --> 13:33.613
What did I shoot?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.281
In that alley?

13:35.481 --> 13:37.779
I was right, wasn't I?

13:37.984 --> 13:41.705
You ID'd the killer,
and it was a-a dead woman.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.372
What... did I shoot?

13:46.576 --> 13:48.670
A ghost.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.622
You're struggling, Jimbo.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.673
Catholic, right?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.046
There's a Heaven and
a Hell and they keep

13:54.292 --> 13:55.760
themselves to themselves.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.052
Well, now you know better.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.847
No. I don't know anything

14:00.048 --> 14:01.300
right now.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.475
I certainly don't know
who to arrest.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.553
Well, you know
who not to arrest.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.066
Don't push your luck.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.523
I checked with the
M.E.'s office. We've had

14:17.732 --> 14:19.325
two dead...

14:19.525 --> 14:21.402
You mind?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.239
We've had two dead bodies

14:24.447 --> 14:26.290
in the past month with wounds
consistent with a pair

14:26.491 --> 14:28.914
of shears as the murder weapon.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.793
And suddenly three murders is
the work of one killer, right?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.049
Misaki Ross.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.045
Ooh.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.172
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.471
She was a model.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.514
Until she had her face slashed
ear to ear by another model.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.852
Here's a picture of Misaki
the day she came out

14:46.052 --> 14:47.520
of the hospital.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.064
Lost her moneymaker.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.811
CORRIGAN: And her life.
Took a bottle of pills

14:52.016 --> 14:52.983
in her French Quarter apartment.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.482
The other model,

14:55.686 --> 14:58.735
Tammy Fraser, she was
indicted for felony assault.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.567
It was all over until...

15:00.775 --> 15:02.448
Until Misaki started killing.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.576
This bird, Tammy Fraser,
she still in prison?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.992
Out in four. Good behavior.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.168
We need to talk to her. And, uh,

15:11.369 --> 15:13.463
what about our hitchhiker?

15:13.663 --> 15:15.791
First person to die on the road
was Philip Carlberg.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.750
Age 19.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.632
Hitched a ride and was
killed, car versus tree.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.837
He leave behind

15:21.045 --> 15:22.592
any family? Grandmother.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.174
We'll need to talk to her
as well.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.679
What good is talking gonna do?

15:25.883 --> 15:27.681
Look, mate, I am fishing.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.762
I admit it. But...

15:29.971 --> 15:33.100
what I want to know is why now.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.775
You see, Misaki

15:34.976 --> 15:37.695
died five years ago.
Philip, three.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.488
They were resting in peace
until...

15:39.689 --> 15:40.815
Whatever happened to wake 'em.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.364
Congratulations.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.617
You're part of the act now
as well.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.370
How do you live with it?

15:50.575 --> 15:53.875
The knowledge that all this
could be...

15:54.078 --> 15:56.627
real?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.048
How?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.047
It marks you.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.050
For life.

16:03.254 --> 16:06.349
But it doesn't change
who you are.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.846
Check his pulse.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.148
I got nothing.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.063
(inhales deeply)

16:20.271 --> 16:21.864
(panting)

16:22.982 --> 16:25.030
Sir,

16:25.234 --> 16:26.406
Are you okay?

16:26.611 --> 16:30.115
I-I think I just... hit my head.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.791
I'll be fine.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.335
(moans) You don't happen
to have a spare shirt

16:34.535 --> 16:36.128
in that ambulance.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.844
TAMMY: We were models together.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.425
We walked the same runways.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.806
We dated the same photographers.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.887
And then one day...

16:53.095 --> 16:55.518
Misaki just blew up, and...

16:55.723 --> 16:58.647
her walk shut down every show

16:58.851 --> 17:00.569
at Fashion Week. And...

17:00.770 --> 17:03.649
I don't know. ljust... snapped.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.986
I understand now that I didn't
have any coping mechanisms.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.117
I have a mental illness.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.790
CONSTANTINE: Oh, um,

17:12.990 --> 17:14.788
they haven't sent me
all the files yet.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.790
I'm... just trying to get
ahead of myself, you know?

17:17.994 --> 17:20.042
Meeting my new parolees.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.296
I got out six months ago.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.800
I work half the week in a rehab
clinic and half the week here.

17:27.003 --> 17:30.383
Sounds like you're hell-bent
on a path to redemption, luv.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.891
(sighs) I can never get rid
of the guilt for what I did.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.189
Every time I help someone, I ask

17:36.389 --> 17:39.063
Misaki's spirit for forgiveness.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.816
(bell tinkles)

17:42.019 --> 17:44.113
ZED: I know this is painful,

17:44.313 --> 17:45.610
But can you please tell me

17:45.815 --> 17:48.944
why your grandson
was hitchhiking that night?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.869
Philip flunked
out of high school.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.745
I had talked the junior
college into accepting him.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.748
And every day he'd
pack up his backpack.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.705
I thought he was going to class,

18:00.913 --> 18:03.132
but he was out smoking weed,

18:03.332 --> 18:06.586
playing video games
with his buddies.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.842
It must have been rough for you.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.889
When I found out, ljust...

18:11.090 --> 18:14.060
ljust had it.
I-l kicked him out.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.513
Tough love, you know?

18:16.721 --> 18:19.770
I thought if I would
cut off his support,

18:19.974 --> 18:21.601
it would scare him straight.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.186
It scared him away?

18:23.394 --> 18:26.364
He hitched a ride into
the city that night.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.613
Police said that the driver
lost control of the car,

18:29.817 --> 18:32.036
and Philip...

18:32.236 --> 18:34.614
he died.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.790
CONSTANTINE: A lot of my clients

18:36.991 --> 18:39.710
are, uh... haunted

18:39.910 --> 18:42.709
by the people they've
hurt with their crimes.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.790
What about you?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.717
You mean am I haunted by Misaki?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.544
I don't know. Are you?

18:48.753 --> 18:50.300
It's, um...

18:50.504 --> 18:52.006
it's funny you'd ask that.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.216
MRS. CARLBERG:
What kind of magazine story

18:54.425 --> 18:56.393
did you say you were writing?

18:56.594 --> 19:00.394
About how, um, people survive
the loss of a child.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.772
And how they find the
strength to move on. (scoffs)

19:03.976 --> 19:06.104
I didn't have any strength.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.155
I was gonna end it all.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.358
But then I talked to him.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.692
You talked to Philip?

19:11.901 --> 19:13.323
TAMMY: I went to see someone.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.746
A man.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.789
And he said that he could

19:17.990 --> 19:20.288
help me contact Misaki's spirit

19:20.493 --> 19:22.086
to ask for her forgiveness.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.130
Right. Like a... medium?

19:25.331 --> 19:27.709
MRS. CARLBERG:
He can call to the spirits

19:27.917 --> 19:31.763
in heaven,
so you can ask 'em questions.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.009
Who's this man?

19:33.214 --> 19:34.966
TAMMY: He calls himself

19:35.174 --> 19:35.891
Papa Midnite.

19:36.092 --> 19:36.843
CONSTANTINE: Papa Midnite.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.394
That's what she said?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.267
He tried to kill you back
in Chicago.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.144
No, I can handle Midnite, luv.
You handle

19:42.348 --> 19:43.816
Dead Man's Road, okay?
Put up a flare.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.814
Don't let anybody crash
into that tree.

19:46.018 --> 19:46.940
Are you gonna be okay?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.066
Of course.

19:48.270 --> 19:52.400
Voodoo's nothing but a magical
excuse for a party, isn't it?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.861
(drumming, chanting)

20:13.879 --> 20:17.099
Attention!

20:37.987 --> 20:40.490
Why do you wish to speak
to your husband?

20:40.698 --> 20:42.450
Clarke had cancer.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.001
He died at home in our bed,

20:44.201 --> 20:45.453
and I wasn't there. I didn't...

20:45.661 --> 20:46.537
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.588
L-I w...

20:51.250 --> 20:54.094
Papa Legba...

20:54.295 --> 20:55.763
(speaking Creole)

21:04.513 --> 21:05.685
(responding in Creole)

21:05.890 --> 21:07.312
(speaking Creole)

21:32.249 --> 21:34.251
(others gasping, murmuring)

21:43.969 --> 21:45.846
Maddy.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.809
Maddy, are you there?

21:50.017 --> 21:52.770
I'm here!

21:52.978 --> 21:54.946
Clarke, I'm here.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.024
What's happening?
I can't see you.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.485
I'm so sorry.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.035
It shouldn't have ended
like this.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.579
I should have been there.

22:01.779 --> 22:02.996
I just wanted to
hold your hand...

22:03.197 --> 22:05.040
PAPA MIDNITE: Maddy.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.914
I miss you so much.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.209
Oh.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.378
I miss you, baby.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.001
CONSTANTINE: Papa Midnite.
Hell of a party, mate.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.628
(People groan)

22:13.833 --> 22:15.551
Sorry I came empty-handed.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.503
It's kind of hard
to find a dessert

22:17.711 --> 22:19.304
that pairs with pig's blood.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.631
Oh, Constantine!

22:20.840 --> 22:21.966
Who are you?

22:22.174 --> 22:23.426
I'm the man
that's gonna keep your husband

22:23.634 --> 22:24.851
where he belongs, luv.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.474
You can thank me later.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.478
You would trespass here?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.025
Now?

22:31.225 --> 22:33.148
While I'm helping people?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.979
Wow, is that what you call it?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.815
Resurrecting the dead's
bad form, Midnite.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.366
Not a resurrection spell.

22:39.567 --> 22:43.868
Well, then, your magic's
out of control.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.494
You think you're talking
to the dead?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.292
You're raising them.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.039
Flesh and bone.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.962
Sending them on a killing spree.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.379
What's he talking about, Papa?

22:53.581 --> 22:54.798
He's a liar and a parasite.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.001
And he recently cost me

22:57.209 --> 23:01.464
a very valuable piece
of music history.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.470
If you didn't owe me
for that acetate,

23:03.674 --> 23:05.597
you'd be a corpse yourself.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.020
I'm sure. You think

23:08.220 --> 23:10.188
you can run your game on me?

23:13.559 --> 23:14.902
(coughing, crowd chatter)

23:15.102 --> 23:16.695
You just

23:16.896 --> 23:20.070
talk to one of your clients,
all right, just one of them,

23:20.274 --> 23:22.026
and you'll be back here

23:22.234 --> 23:23.952
begging me for just...

23:24.153 --> 23:25.746
(mumbles)

23:25.946 --> 23:27.823
(crowd chatter)

23:30.075 --> 23:32.169
Get in there.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.424
Keep it going-

23:41.629 --> 23:42.676
(brakes squeak)

23:42.880 --> 23:45.258
Detective Corrigan,

23:45.466 --> 23:47.264
what are you doing here?

23:47.468 --> 23:49.516
Probably the same thing you are.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.393
Off duty?

23:51.597 --> 23:55.192
My sergeant banned me from
the streets near the stabbings.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.019
Said I needed some rest.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.195
She's probably right.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.444
You know, I thought
I'd seen it all, but

24:01.649 --> 24:04.027
you and your partner have me
more than a little freaked out.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.987
It's a bigger world
than we ever dreamed, Detective.

24:07.196 --> 24:10.120
Call me Jim.
So, what's your plan here?

24:10.324 --> 24:13.123
Trying to keep people
off the road, Jim.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.750
In case he comes back.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.127
(insects trilling)

24:17.331 --> 24:19.299
I have a better idea.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.253
Instead of stopping other people
from picking him up...

24:22.461 --> 24:25.635
why don't we pick him up?

24:25.839 --> 24:28.342
(bird calling)

24:28.550 --> 24:31.850
PAPA MIDNITE: I wasn't just going
to let him walk away, dear sister.

24:32.054 --> 24:35.479
Not after he cost me
the bluesman's hell song.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.690
The English dog doesn't know
when he's whipped.

24:41.897 --> 24:45.151
He had the gall
to disrespect me.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.339
But, Cedella...

24:58.539 --> 25:02.715
in the underworld
you can see all.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.421
I have to know,

25:05.629 --> 25:09.304
is Constantine
telling the truth?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.761
(indistinct female whispering)

25:16.598 --> 25:18.896
(reggae music playing)

25:23.105 --> 25:25.733
Keep it running. Yes, sir.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.033
(loud thumping)

25:27.234 --> 25:28.952
Sleeping Beauty's
waking up, huh?

25:29.153 --> 25:31.281
(thumping)

25:31.488 --> 25:32.990
CONSTANTINE:
lf nothing else, mate,

25:33.198 --> 25:35.917
then just turn down
that bloody reggae, will you?

25:36.118 --> 25:38.337
(sighs, muffled sound
of music on radio)

25:46.628 --> 25:48.926
(sighs)

25:52.801 --> 25:55.805
MADDY: Papa, I just don't
know how to thank you.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.186
I mean, I always know
your ritual was gonna work

25:58.390 --> 26:00.484
and allow me to speak to Clarke.

26:00.684 --> 26:04.439
I just didn't know it was
gonna bring my baby back to me.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.987
This was not the miracle

26:08.192 --> 26:09.785
I intended.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.488
(coughs)

26:12.696 --> 26:15.290
It won't end well, Madeline.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.663
(coughing)

26:16.867 --> 26:18.210
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.912
She'll be fine.
She'll be fine, Papa.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.212
(coughing continues)

26:21.413 --> 26:24.041
I'm taking care of her now.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.504
(chuckles)

26:34.885 --> 26:37.138
Pop the trunk.
I need to question him.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.223
Have at it, mate.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.398
Ask me anything you like.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.397
The driver's in the boot.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.524
He's taking a bit of a kip,
in case you're wondering.

26:44.728 --> 26:45.945
Was I right?

26:46.146 --> 26:47.864
Did you drag that poor woman's

26:48.065 --> 26:49.863
husband back from the grave?

26:50.067 --> 26:52.695
He's killing her, draining
her energy. I could feel it.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.405
Oh, marriage can be hell, eh?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.490
There's something wrong
with my magic.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.450
Another force is working
against me.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.457
It's the rising darkness.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.709
I'm surprised it's taken you
this long to notice.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.836
It's causing havoc everywhere.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.542
We have to stop this.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.797
We have to put these spirits

27:08.001 --> 27:09.503
back down. Right.

27:09.711 --> 27:13.011
So, it's, uh, "we" now, is it?

27:13.215 --> 27:15.058
I could help you
for sure, but, uh...

27:15.259 --> 27:17.808
but I'm going to need
something from you.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.558
Your debt is erased.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.060
Ta for that.

27:21.265 --> 27:25.441
And, uh, I have a question
for your sister.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.275
Only if we're successful.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.030
Good enough.

27:33.235 --> 27:36.284
(engine starting)

27:45.873 --> 27:47.671
You've been driving for a while.

27:47.875 --> 27:48.797
Want to let me take a turn?

27:49.001 --> 27:49.923
Why?

27:50.127 --> 27:52.346
Are you tired of looking?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.344
Is this your first stakeout,
Detective?

27:54.548 --> 27:56.391
First time staking out a ghost.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.139
Mine, too. I thought

27:58.343 --> 27:59.219
you people were experts.

27:59.428 --> 28:00.805
That would be Constantine.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.560
Afraid it's all new to me.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.017
Huh. Couldn't tell. That whole

28:05.225 --> 28:07.273
psychic thing... that...

28:07.477 --> 28:08.603
that threw me.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.485
I don't blame you.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.657
I sure wouldn't want anyone
reaching into my mind.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.110
Of course not.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.366
Considering what
you're running from.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.619
What are you talking about?

28:19.823 --> 28:22.497
Finally figured out why
you're so familiar to me, Zed.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.788
When did you change your name?

28:29.499 --> 28:31.547
There he is.
Lucky he didn't stop.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.593
- All right then.
- Here we go.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.019
(brakes squeak)

28:43.555 --> 28:45.148
Do you need a ride?

28:45.349 --> 28:46.601
Yes.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.569
Will you take me to the city?

28:49.770 --> 28:51.522
Get in.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.209
So, what's in the city?

29:04.409 --> 29:06.753
I don't know.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.298
I just know I need to get there.

29:18.924 --> 29:22.349
It must be hard to leave home,
isn't it?

29:22.552 --> 29:26.227
It was for me.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.149
Why did you leave?

29:29.393 --> 29:31.737
It was time.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.446
Is that why you left, Philip?

29:36.650 --> 29:38.277
(whoosh)

29:39.945 --> 29:41.197
Where'd he go?

29:41.405 --> 29:42.782
In front of you.

29:42.990 --> 29:43.957
(engine revving)

29:44.157 --> 29:45.124
What are you doing? Watch it!

29:45.325 --> 29:47.999
Stop!

29:48.203 --> 29:49.876
(tires squealing)

29:50.080 --> 29:52.708
(panting)

30:01.049 --> 30:03.893
You know, there are
better ways we can do this.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.096
I will perform a ritual tonight

30:06.305 --> 30:07.648
and ask the Loa
to rest these spirits.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.225
You know that old song
about the hammer

30:09.433 --> 30:11.356
- that thinks that everything is a nail?
- No.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.403
You may be grand
poobah of voodoo, mate,

30:13.603 --> 30:16.026
but that's one very specific,
very narrow modality.

30:16.231 --> 30:20.361
And what do you know, jackass
of all trades, master of none?

30:20.569 --> 30:22.242
What I know is, my people are
out there playing Whac-a-Mole

30:22.446 --> 30:23.618
with the newly risen.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.621
Misaki, Philip, Devereaux.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.295
They need to be put down
at the source.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.544
(sighs)

30:34.875 --> 30:39.381
Age before beauty, mate.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.808
Here lies Clarke Devereaux,

30:43.008 --> 30:47.013
first of the three bodies
we're snatching today.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.473
Your turn.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.727
This is disrespectful.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.311
(groans)

30:54.519 --> 30:56.647
Those people came to you
for closure, mate,

30:56.855 --> 30:58.323
and you took their money

30:58.523 --> 30:59.695
without thought of consequence.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.243
Because of you,

31:01.443 --> 31:02.740
they've got more blood
on their hands.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.662
That's disrespectful. (groans)

31:04.863 --> 31:08.037
And you're the one to lecture me
on guilt and responsibility?

31:08.241 --> 31:10.664
(yells)

31:10.869 --> 31:13.213
(grunting)

31:16.458 --> 31:18.256
(coughing)

31:18.460 --> 31:21.134
Are you sure only
three bodies have risen?

31:21.338 --> 31:23.636
Only three I know of, mate.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.808
What is this spell?

31:26.009 --> 31:28.728
Relictum spiritum
expurga tionis.

31:28.929 --> 31:31.307
We bless each corpse, bring
them back to your ritual place

31:31.515 --> 31:32.858
and burn them.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.184
Should release their
ghosts from this plane.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.519
I don't like it.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.525
It's sloppy.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.652
You're like a child
with your father's spell book.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.324
The only magic
my old man ever did

31:41.525 --> 31:43.243
was making a pint disappear.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.537
Now, talking of dead weight,
give us a hand, will you?

31:45.737 --> 31:46.784
(sighs)

31:50.325 --> 31:53.044
He disappeared.
The car went right through him.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.292
Each one
of these ghosts is operating

31:54.496 --> 31:55.918
by their own set of rules.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.340
They must have
something in common

31:57.541 --> 31:59.293
other than Papa Midnite.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.970
What did the hitchhiker's
grandmother say to you?

32:02.170 --> 32:04.298
She feels responsible
for Philip's death.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.803
Yeah, Tammy's the same.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.009
She's riddled with guilt.

32:08.218 --> 32:11.643
That bird did her time,
but she's still in prison.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.599
I'm gonna try to pick him up
again, John.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.400
I think I can get him to stay.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.477
Good. Keep him off the road.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.814
I'm combining spells
with Papa Midnite

32:20.021 --> 32:21.523
to put these spirits
down for good.

32:21.731 --> 32:25.827
Constantine, it's time.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.119
Got to go, luv.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.913
Hear us, gods,

32:36.121 --> 32:39.125
this spell
is of our own creation.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.881
We bow to you, united.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.634
Well, if it's come
to that, mate,

32:44.838 --> 32:47.808
these are dark days indeed.

33:00.562 --> 33:01.779
Hi, Philip.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.360
Do you need a ride?

33:06.568 --> 33:08.366
Yes.

33:08.570 --> 33:09.913
Will you take me to the city?

33:10.113 --> 33:12.332
Hop in.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.836
I met your grandmother.

33:24.044 --> 33:28.220
I know she wanted you to
be something you weren't.

33:28.423 --> 33:32.053
And when she kicked you out, she
did it because she loved you.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.272
And you just wanted

33:35.472 --> 33:37.566
to get away.

33:37.766 --> 33:41.236
You didn't know how
to talk to each other.

33:41.436 --> 33:45.862
Could you, um...
could you pull over?

33:56.701 --> 33:58.578
Relictum spiritum

33:58.787 --> 34:01.040
expurgationis.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.091
(speaking Creole)

34:08.045 --> 34:09.844
(speaks Creole)

34:10.047 --> 34:13.723
I call to you, Loa!

34:13.927 --> 34:15.600
Work through me!

34:15.804 --> 34:17.681
Aah!

34:24.813 --> 34:26.860
Bodies are barely bloody singed.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.282
PAPA MIDNITE:
This is your fault.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.951
Salting and burning the bodies

34:30.150 --> 34:33.155
does no good without
the cooperation of the Loa.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.206
Whoa, whoa, whoa... my part of
the spell went perfect, mate.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.784
You're the one that was
jilted by your big bad

34:37.993 --> 34:39.335
- bloody voodoo gods.
- It's your lack

34:39.536 --> 34:41.504
of respect that keeps them away.

34:41.705 --> 34:43.081
The Danse Vaudou
is about letting go

34:43.290 --> 34:44.917
of your ego and allowing
a more powerful

34:45.125 --> 34:46.422
force to enter you.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.797
Yeah, well, I'm
an exorcist, mate.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.550
I spent half my life
kicking demons out.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.097
Why would I want
to invite one in?

34:51.297 --> 34:53.175
You are a magpie of magic.

34:53.382 --> 34:54.760
A thief of tradition.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.891
You steal from other people's
cultures and beliefs

34:57.094 --> 34:57.971
To suit your own purposes.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.021
Oh, yeah?

34:59.222 --> 35:00.439
Well, whatever works, eh?

35:00.640 --> 35:01.812
It worked wonders
on that little girl

35:02.017 --> 35:03.269
you sent to hell.

35:03.476 --> 35:06.605
Well, at least it wasn't
my own bloody sister.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.987
I need to do this alone.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.319
I'm the one with the power
to raise the dead.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.323
(grunts)

35:13.528 --> 35:14.370
Bollocks! It wasn't even you.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.073
If it wasn't for those women

35:16.281 --> 35:17.373
bringing their pain
into your house,

35:17.574 --> 35:19.417
they'd be...

35:21.202 --> 35:22.670
Oh, Johnny boy,

35:22.871 --> 35:24.748
Johnny, boy, you are such
a... Give me the phone.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.754
I know what went wrong.
Just give me the bloody phone.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.018
Hey, kid, get out of here.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.318
(gasps, shrieks)

35:46.519 --> 35:48.066
Do you think I'm pretty?

35:48.271 --> 35:50.444
I don't know, uh...
Do you think I'm pretty?

35:50.649 --> 35:53.118
Do you... What do you mean?

35:53.318 --> 35:55.616
I wonder, d-do you
think you're pretty?

35:55.820 --> 35:58.039
Do you think I'm pretty?

35:58.239 --> 35:59.661
Uh, do you think
it's gonna rain?

35:59.866 --> 36:01.413
Do you think I'm pretty?

36:01.618 --> 36:03.040
Can you believe
it's taken me this long

36:03.244 --> 36:05.997
to start asking you questions?

36:08.416 --> 36:10.384
Guess this is the right place.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.632
Here's everyone you asked for.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.883
(coughs)

36:13.088 --> 36:14.681
Filled them in on the way.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.679
Nice one, Corrigan.

36:16.883 --> 36:18.180
What's going on, Papa?

36:18.385 --> 36:20.387
We tried a spell
to put your ghosts down,

36:20.595 --> 36:22.518
but, unfortunately,

36:22.722 --> 36:24.269
it didn't work.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.476
You see,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.312
Midnite didn't
raise those spirits.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.022
Not really.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.652
You three did.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.449
How?

36:33.650 --> 36:35.152
All three of you...

36:35.360 --> 36:36.657
You keep the dead alive

36:36.861 --> 36:38.784
because you can't
forgive yourselves.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.161
Guilt is a very powerful
emotion.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.995
There's a lot of energy
in that pain.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.331
No. I won't lose Clarke again.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.085
I can't.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.461
PAPA MIDNITE: Madeline.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.793
Look at me.

36:53.461 --> 36:56.806
It was Clarke's time to go.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.179
You understand?

36:59.384 --> 37:02.763
(crying)

37:02.971 --> 37:05.565
It's not your time.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.736
Papa.

37:09.936 --> 37:10.858
(coughs)

37:12.981 --> 37:15.029
Okay.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.076
Do it.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.905
We have her consent.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.835
All right, then. Let's do this.

37:34.461 --> 37:37.214
Great Loa, we have

37:37.422 --> 37:40.096
offered you something
deeper than blood.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.643
Please accept...

37:41.843 --> 37:43.937
(yelling)

37:44.137 --> 37:46.856
(choking)

37:47.056 --> 37:48.979
I see them, Zed.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.107
Maddy?

37:53.188 --> 37:54.531
(flames whooshing)

37:54.731 --> 37:56.529
(loud, guttural gasping)

37:56.733 --> 37:57.985
PHILIP:
It was right in front of me.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.287
The lights of the city.

38:00.487 --> 38:03.161
Good. You're almost there.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.458
(whoosh)

38:07.869 --> 38:10.213
(whoosh)

38:12.081 --> 38:15.585
(whoosh)

38:18.922 --> 38:20.845
(whoosh)

38:36.648 --> 38:37.900
(crickets chirping)

38:38.107 --> 38:39.575
(car door closing)

38:39.776 --> 38:41.995
(insects chirping and trilling)

38:47.075 --> 38:49.328
Thank you for helping us...

38:49.536 --> 38:52.335
even if we sounded crazy.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.292
I'm the one who's crazy.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.252
Running after a ghost
with a gun.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.508
(laughs)

38:59.712 --> 39:02.716
Won't make that mistake again.

39:05.927 --> 39:09.431
A year or so back,
I worked missing persons.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.107
Terrible gig.

39:11.307 --> 39:14.652
But I was good at it,
good at faces.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.323
Hard to forget a face
like yours.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.696
(gasps)

39:20.900 --> 39:25.201
You were reported missing
by your... family.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.157
You were never found, but

39:27.365 --> 39:31.120
you were spotted once
on a security camera,

39:31.327 --> 39:34.456
shoplifting
at a gas station mart.

39:36.541 --> 39:40.011
It was an apple...

39:40.211 --> 39:43.055
and a stale cheese sandwich.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.976
It was delicious.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.771
That, um,

39:50.972 --> 39:53.145
missing persons file...

39:53.349 --> 39:57.195
Does it still exist?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.739
Not anymore.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.112
(sighs)

40:06.404 --> 40:08.782
(sighs)

40:12.410 --> 40:14.458
(whooshing)

40:14.662 --> 40:17.165
(guttural gurgling)

40:19.083 --> 40:20.756
(guttural gurgling)

40:22.629 --> 40:26.133
You Okay?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.228
You Okay?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.647
Yeah. Yeah?

40:32.847 --> 40:36.067
I'm fine.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.156
Our truce is over

40:41.356 --> 40:43.905
at the bottom of that glass,
so sip cautiously.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.405
Mm.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.363
A rich man's Scotch.

40:48.571 --> 40:51.120
It always comes
with an aftertaste.

40:51.324 --> 40:54.544
The sour taste is in
your mouth, street wizard,

40:54.744 --> 40:57.213
because the old gods
don't honor you.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.508
Your magic isn't strong
enough to raise the dead.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.460
Oh, the dead are better
left buried, mate.

41:02.669 --> 41:04.763
Is that so? Mm-hmm.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.807
Even ifl offered you a chance
to talk to your mother?

41:09.884 --> 41:12.478
Huh.

41:14.055 --> 41:16.729
That's not what
you owe me, is it?

41:16.933 --> 41:21.188
I'd like you to get on your
hotline to hell, find out about

41:21.396 --> 41:23.239
this rising darkness.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.363
The rule book's been thrown out.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.945
I want to know what
I'm dealing with.

41:45.712 --> 41:48.010
Sister...

41:50.299 --> 41:53.269
(indistinct female whispering)

41:59.434 --> 42:01.687
Thank you, Cedella.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.363
Well?

42:04.564 --> 42:08.785
All your efforts are in vain.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.248
The darkness is coming,

42:13.448 --> 42:17.123
heralded by someone
close to you,

42:17.326 --> 42:20.421
someone who will betray you.
