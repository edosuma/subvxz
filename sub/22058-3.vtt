00:01.126 --> 00:02.711
<i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:02.794 --> 00:03.795
Dr. Teller?

00:03.879 --> 00:06.048
Come with me.
You're no longer safe here.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.054
There's a helicopter
leaving in the next 15 minutes.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.515
And if we're not on that chopper,
we don't survive.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.311
Supplies are all still here.
Even ammo. It makes no sense.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.439
-No sign of a struggle.
-Like they vanished into thin air.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.859
Where are we going anyway?

00:25.943 --> 00:28.820
-Your daughter's alive.
-Lucy?

01:11.863 --> 01:14.241
Estimate six days
to our next rendezvous.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.493
-Roberta.
-What?

01:16.577 --> 01:17.744
Lucy.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.376
Yeah, right.

01:53.572 --> 01:58.118
<i>[woman, echoing]
Tommy. Why did you leave? Help me.</i>

02:02.789 --> 02:05.125
[distantly] Tommy! I'm here!

02:06.627 --> 02:09.546
Over here! I'm hurt! I'm here!

02:29.483 --> 02:30.525
<i>[woman] Here it comes.</i>

02:30.901 --> 02:32.277
[glass breaks]

02:35.947 --> 02:37.240
<i>Hang on, Lucy.</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:06.186
Dad?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.665
Hey.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.509
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:40.679 --> 03:44.015
-I didn't know you were alive.
-Yeah, well, now you know.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.148
You've grown.

03:52.691 --> 03:56.528
Yeah, that happens, regardless
of whether you're there for it or not.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.990
Sure. You've just done it rather quickly.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.660
Um... yeah.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.418
Look, have I done something
to disappoint you?

04:11.501 --> 04:12.961
Oh, no.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.214
I mean, because if I have, I'm sorry.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.842
I don't know exactly
what I could've done differently.

04:21.178 --> 04:25.432
To be honest, it's hard,
this whole parenting thing.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.184
You know, being responsible,

04:27.267 --> 04:30.520
what with the Zompocalypse
and everything.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.730
Whatever.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.528
- You look a little different yourself.
- Oh, uh, yeah.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.031
I'm cured.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.533
Was there something wrong?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.495
-No, no, no, no. Not like that.
-No. No, it's okay.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.580
No, no, no. I didn't mean that--

04:48.663 --> 04:49.498
Relax.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.751
Honestly, I...

04:52.834 --> 04:56.797
I just don't feel anything... with you.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.596
-I understand.
-Yeah.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.016
-But I think that if--
-But you...

05:08.099 --> 05:09.267
Lucy.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.362
Something's wrong, isn't it?

05:22.072 --> 05:23.073
Yeah.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.330
-Addy?
-I didn't want to leave her.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.499
She told me to go.
She said she'd find me.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.669
We were headed to a refugee camp.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.463
-Everyone's going to Newmerica.
-Okay.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.010
We should get to that camp.
She'll come look for us there.

05:46.930 --> 05:47.973
Okay.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.908
[engine starts]

06:15.292 --> 06:19.129
I've seen some bad things, man.
Things I couldn't explain.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.298
But this one...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.174
Maybe they got tired of waiting
and just left.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.678
Well, why not take all the gear,
the weapons and supplies?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.054
It makes no damn sense.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.349
We're not doing ourselves any favors
wasting time trying to figure it out.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.935
-We need to be proactive.
-What do you suggest?

06:34.019 --> 06:36.938
Pick up and head north.
The sooner, the better.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.442
Well, we will,
soon as my friend gets back.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.985
I know where he's headed.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.988
He's going back to their tent.
I was there.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.198
He's not gonna find her.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.617
He's gonna find whatever it was

06:48.700 --> 06:51.536
that ripped her face off
and ate her soul.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.912
I've been doing this long enough

06:52.996 --> 06:56.249
to know when a situation
is no longer compatible with survival.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.635
What makes you think
that whatever cleared this place out

07:06.718 --> 07:09.304
won't be coming back?

07:09.387 --> 07:11.222
Hey, I understand.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.100
And if you need to leave,
I'm not gonna stop you.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.560
But I'm staying.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.980
Look, man. I had one mission.

07:19.064 --> 07:22.150
Keep everyone in this camp alive.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.319
Now there's four of us.

07:24.402 --> 07:28.073
I'll be damned if I'll let you
kill yourselves on my watch.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.503
[vehicle approaching]

07:56.184 --> 07:57.519
Identify yourselves!

08:03.358 --> 08:05.068
Doc?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.277
Warren?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.156
Warren!

08:13.410 --> 08:15.078
[laughs]

08:20.500 --> 08:22.460
What the hell, Chief?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.546
I'm digging the hair.

08:24.629 --> 08:28.133
-You like? Apocalyptic blond.
-Right on!

08:28.216 --> 08:29.342
[both laugh]

08:30.802 --> 08:31.886
Hey, Lucy.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.685
What's up, Doc?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.781
Thanks, man.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.951
You're the first person on the mainland
who's been half happy to see me.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.327
What do you mean?

08:58.246 --> 09:02.208
Oh, yeah. Well...
you reap what you spawn, brother.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.544
Ain't that the truth.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.719
I'm Lieutenant Mueller.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.639
And this... is Sergeant Lilley.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.978
Sergeant Lilley?
It's got a nice ring to it.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.731
Sarge will do, hippy.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.192
Sergeant. I'm Lieutenant Warren.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.818
Ex National Guard.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.653
This is Murphy. Ex human.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.865
We all go way back.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.077
I hate to cut this love-fest short,
but we've got some decisions to make.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.120
To bring you up to speed,

09:39.204 --> 09:41.873
we left a group of survivors here
a few hours ago

09:41.956 --> 09:44.250
to intercept a convoy
that was overdue.

09:44.334 --> 09:48.421
We found it abandoned, were ambushed,
and lost a good man.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.714
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.050
When we returned,
we found the camp abandoned.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.468
Everybody gone.

09:53.551 --> 09:57.263
-Any sign of a fight?
-No. Just gone.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.057
Including Red and Sun Mei.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.394
-They're both alive?
-Yeah. Last time I saw them.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.772
-10K?
-Yeah, 10K's with us.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.775
He's out there now
looking for Red and the others.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.860
We gotta get on the move
while there's still daylight.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.987
Whatever's out there
that got your friends,

10:13.071 --> 10:15.198
will most surely be out there
when the sun sets.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.033
Well, 10K's still out there.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.743
I understand your concern,

10:18.827 --> 10:24.499
but I can't risk these vehicles, supplies,
and all of our lives for one individual.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.794
You know he's coming back, Chief.
You know he is.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.256
If she's out there, he'll find her.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.508
-We'll wait till morning.
-That's a mistake.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.678
Wouldn't be my first.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.556
[whistles]

10:52.777 --> 10:55.405
[birds cawing]

11:15.717 --> 11:17.844
<i>[woman screaming]</i>

11:41.951 --> 11:46.164
-What's she staring at?
-That's complicated.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.834
If she's looking for your friend,
she's looking the wrong way.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.712
He went south.
She's looking east.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.256
Well, maybe she's not looking for him.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.301
So what was it like over there? Zona?

11:58.801 --> 12:02.138
[chuckles] Hell of a lot better
than our current situation.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.806
Why'd you leave?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.517
Like I said, it's complicated.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.228
Try me. I'm a good listener.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.230
Something about The Reset.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.525
-You ever heard of that?
-Nope. Sounds like a good idea though.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.402
[chuckles]

12:16.486 --> 12:21.157
All I know is that for two full years,
it was like Club Med.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.910
Except for free. And then one day,

12:23.993 --> 12:27.997
a guy gets cracked over the head
with a four-iron and then... [scoffs]

12:28.081 --> 12:31.417
Well, none of that matters anymore.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.294
Now it's about getting all of you
to Newmerica.

12:33.378 --> 12:36.339
About this Newmerica thing.
Why are we all going there again?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.091
It's the only place to go.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.219
Actual civilization. Fortified.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.555
They have food, munitions,
a growing society.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.766
Yeah, yeah. That sounds familiar.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.268
What do you mean by that?

12:49.352 --> 12:52.438
I mean, I have heard that
a hundred times before.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.232
And every time we'd get there,

12:54.315 --> 12:57.527
it's some Utopian cult freakshow
blah, blah, blah.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.697
And then by the time we leave,
it's on fire.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.949
No one said anything about Utopia.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.160
It's a functioning outpost. That's it.
But it's all we've got.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.080
Whatever it is, it can't be better
than where we just left.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.623
Maybe it's more real.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.755
Hey. How's she doing?

13:17.839 --> 13:21.175
She's sleeping.
Doesn't much feel like talking.

13:21.259 --> 13:25.096
So, how do you feel
about this whole Newmerica thing?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.389
I'm all for it.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.891
I'm all for any place that's not here.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.978
I just don't know how we're gonna
get to Canada without that convoy.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.439
Wait, hold up.
This thing's in Canada?

13:34.522 --> 13:36.983
Roger that.
We are headed for the Yukon.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.319
Nobody said anything
about freaking Canada.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.655
-You got a problem with Canada?
-Yeah. I do.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.116
It's far. And cold.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.452
I don't think you got much of a choice.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.371
Well, hey. Welcome back
to the Apocalypse.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.173
So what's the deal with these jugheads?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.384
-No, jarheads.
-Whatever.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.179
No, they're okay.
We've been through some shit together.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.307
Well, I've been led blindly
by enough military intelligence

14:09.390 --> 14:11.184
to know it's an oxymoron.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.728
What's the deal with this Newmerica crap?
Are you buying it?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.481
-Well, what choice do we have?
-I could think of a few.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.234
I know you've been living like the Pope
of Zombietown for the past two years.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.320
But it's slim pickings
out here in the cheap seats.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.739
What, so we follow them just 'cause
they're the only game in town?

14:24.822 --> 14:27.325
Well, yeah.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.078
Why do I feel like we've been
down this road before?

14:30.161 --> 14:32.372
Because we have.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.165
Man, you are not cheering me up.

14:42.632 --> 14:46.302
What's up with Warren?
Is she, like... herself or what?

14:46.386 --> 14:50.014
It's hard to say.
I mean, she's all there, but...

14:50.098 --> 14:53.851
it seems like there's more there there
than there used to be.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.186
You know what I'm saying?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.314
Not really.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.912
[insects buzzing]

16:06.883 --> 16:08.843

<i>Help me.</i>

16:34.410 --> 16:36.829
<i>Tommy!</i>

16:36.913 --> 16:37.997
<i>Look out!</i>

16:54.764 --> 16:56.349
-What the hell was that?
-What?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.267
-You didn't hear that?
-I didn't hear anything. Did you?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.602
Listen.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.313
-Where did it come from?
-Over there.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.607
Or-- or maybe over there.

17:07.652 --> 17:08.736
Or there.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.504
-[branches rustling]
-Over there!

17:28.214 --> 17:30.049
-I heard that!
-I heard that, too!

17:41.852 --> 17:45.856
Something's out there.
Watching us. Waiting for us.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.818
Maybe it's one of them mad Zs.
The kinds that won't go down.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.279
Wait, what are you talking about?

17:51.362 --> 17:53.239
-You haven't seen one?
-Nope.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.323
You're lucky.

17:54.407 --> 17:58.244
One of my men,
he went down during the fire fight.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.829
We had to mercy him.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.330
Head shot.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.124
And still, he came back.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.459
I heard rumors about unkillable Zs.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.086
The virus mutating.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.422
But I never thought they were real.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.258
You start to wonder
if something's happening out there.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.093
Something that can't be stopped.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.680
Some fresh hell
we've brought upon ourselves.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.807
Could explain what happened here.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.143
It's enough to make you
want to run into the abyss.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.104
Death by Apocalypse.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.064
Yeah, well, maybe we should
do something about it.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.482
You know, before it's too late.

18:28.566 --> 18:31.444
We should've left hours ago,
but we're waiting for your boy.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.780
Our boy saved your ass back there.
Did you forget about that?

18:34.864 --> 18:37.783
Not personal, bud. I feel you.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.952
We've all lost people.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.747
We got to be smart and move.

18:42.830 --> 18:47.460
In my experience,
people who wait too long, they're dead.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.420
[loud rustling and thumping]

19:01.057 --> 19:02.433
Anybody got eyes?

19:06.646 --> 19:07.688
Over there.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.902
[rustling and snarling]

19:14.070 --> 19:15.112
Mother of God.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.398
We got to get out of here.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.441
We're not going anywhere
until Warren says so.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.818
-Ain't that right, Murphy?
-Huh?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.236
Ain't that right, Murphy?

19:55.319 --> 19:58.155
Yeah. That's right.
What he said, she said.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.324
Well, I'm not staying put
while whatever's out there

20:00.408 --> 20:02.118
prepares to dine on my innards.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.745
I'd rather die on my feet
than on my ass.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.997
Are you sure
those are the only options?

20:07.081 --> 20:09.333
Sergeant, you're coming with me.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.753
Hey, what are you doing?

20:12.837 --> 20:16.465
You're just gonna leave us here stranded?
We're safer if we stick together.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.093
If your friend's out there,
we'll find him and bring him back.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.804
We'll just see what Warren
has to say about that.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.432
I don't know what's going on
with Lieutenant Warren.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.560
Be alert. We'll be back shortly.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.230
If he's out there, we'll get him.
Sergeant!

20:38.696 --> 20:40.448
Never get out of the boat.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.206
<i>Go east.</i>

20:49.290 --> 20:51.917
<i>Always east.</i>

20:52.001 --> 20:54.086
<i>Always east.</i>

20:54.170 --> 20:56.338
<i>Follow the signs.</i>

20:56.422 --> 20:58.674
<i>Follow the rainbow.</i>

20:58.758 --> 21:02.094
<i>The rising sun.</i>

21:02.178 --> 21:03.345
<i>You know the way.</i>

21:06.348 --> 21:08.434
<i>It burns.</i>

21:10.352 --> 21:11.645
<i>It burns.</i>

21:13.647 --> 21:15.524
<i>It burns.</i>

21:18.110 --> 21:19.320
Sorry.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.991
Are you okay?

21:24.074 --> 21:25.117
Hey.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.330
I brought you some water.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.255
-What happened?
-You passed out.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.176
I got to quit doing that.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.678
Last time it happened, I lost two years.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.766
Really is good to see you.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.352
Good to see you too.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.438
-Not sure what the hell we're doing here.
-We're waiting for 10K.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.193
I still can't believe you're alive.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.028
Well, I guess I can believe it.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.613
Should've never doubted it.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.619
Tell you what, you didn't miss much.

22:08.702 --> 22:11.664
The last two years
was like one long root canal.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.541
Meanwhile, you guys...

22:14.708 --> 22:17.127
Was life really that sweet in Zona?

22:20.339 --> 22:23.092
I don't know, Doc.
I slept through the party.

22:23.259 --> 22:27.846
Yeah, I feel that way about '60s
and the '70s and '80s.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.016
Most of the '90s.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.648
Well, Chief, I hate to sound
like a broken record, but...

22:42.403 --> 22:45.322
I still keep wondering if it's worth it.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.408
-If what's worth it?
-I don't know.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.160
You know, all the caring for each other,

22:50.244 --> 22:53.372
relying on each other,
trying to stay positive,

22:53.455 --> 22:57.418
and keep the faith in the midst
of this Apocalyptic shitstorm.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.296
-You know what I mean?
-All too well.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.090
Well, is it worth it?

23:03.173 --> 23:05.843
Of course it is. It's all we got.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.765
Yeah, I mean I know. I know.

23:11.849 --> 23:16.478
But, really, is it really worth it?

23:24.445 --> 23:25.529
Yes.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.994
All right.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.371
I guess I just needed
to hear that from you.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.791
I'm gonna shut up now.
You get some rest.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.169
-Okay.
-Okay. Good night.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.574
Sergeant?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.375
[branches cracking, low growling]

25:15.889 --> 25:17.641
Explain the mentality to me.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.643
You know, creepy, threatening sounds

25:19.727 --> 25:23.188
coming from the deep,
dark, zombie-infested woods.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.441
So, hey, let's go follow it.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.568
I mean, what sense does that make?

25:27.651 --> 25:30.863
Rarely am I wrong,
and yet rarely am I listened to.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.323
If people just did what I told them to,
they'd be better off.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.203
Go ahead. Roll your eyes.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.080
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.457
Good to see you, Lucy.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.546
Hey, Lucy. What happened to Addy?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.423
-Did she make it?
-Yeah, she made it.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.549
I knew it.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.509
She was shot. In the face.

25:52.593 --> 25:53.635
What?

25:53.719 --> 25:55.137
I-is she all right?

25:55.220 --> 25:57.181
It was a sniper.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.808
Sniper? When?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.102
A few hours ago.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.104
-10K.
-What?

26:04.188 --> 26:07.107
Nothing. We need to go find her.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.442
She said don't wait.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.695
That we should stick together
and she'd meet us in Newmerica.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.405
She'll find me.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.160
What do you think happened
to them refugees?

26:18.243 --> 26:19.995
I think Lieutenant Buzzcut was right.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.539
I think they realized no help was coming
and got the hell out of here.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.135
Wait a minute. Wait a second.
I know this guy.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.972
-What?
-I know him.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.141
-Who the hell is it?
-That's Burgess. He's one of the refugees.

27:23.225 --> 27:26.270
Hey, buddy.
Hey, it's Doc, your friend.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.813
Look, man, you're safe now.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.942
Burgess, what the hell
happened to everyone?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.527
Can you answer me, man?

27:36.071 --> 27:37.531
Where did everyone go?

27:42.661 --> 27:43.704
[Doc] Burgess?

27:46.081 --> 27:48.333
Here.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.961
Listen to me.

27:51.044 --> 27:55.173
I need to know what happened here.
Where did everybody go?

27:56.884 --> 28:00.262
Come on, Burgess!
You got to help us out, man. Are we safe?

28:02.264 --> 28:04.224
What? You were expecting
a different answer?

28:04.308 --> 28:08.228
So, what you saw, was it alive?
Or was it something else?

28:10.564 --> 28:13.942
All right, man. Hey, hey. Okay.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.153
Breathe. Breathe.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.618
Okay.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.453
Now hear me.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.664
I need you to pull yourself together.
I need your help.

28:27.748 --> 28:30.375
Our friends are out there,
we need to know what we're up against.

28:32.669 --> 28:36.340
He's zombie ga-ga.
I've seen it a million times.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.507
Get outside.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.228
Whatever happened,
it traumatized that poor soul.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.230
I don't think we're gonna
get much out of him.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.440
We need to consider our options.

28:53.523 --> 28:54.942
There's only four of us.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.319
We can get in that truck
and get out of here right now.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.529
-What about 10K?
-What about him, Doc?

28:59.613 --> 29:01.031
For all we know, he found Red

29:01.114 --> 29:02.866
and he's headed back
to his hideout right now.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.535
He left you here without considering
what might happen to you.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.287
He could be home.
He could be zombie-chow.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.456
Either way, we can't stick
around here to find out.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.582
Yeah, we can!

29:10.666 --> 29:13.669
We can't go anywhere right now.
10K and the soldiers are out there.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.047
You're better off with them.
At least here, you have supplies.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.883
What do you mean,
"you're better off with them"?

29:19.967 --> 29:21.343
Are you not coming with us?

29:50.956 --> 29:52.708
Hang tight.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.544
I'll find you.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.681
[branches crack]

30:44.968 --> 30:46.720
[snarling]

31:29.638 --> 31:31.181
I give you mercy, soldier.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.105
You can rest now, brother.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.039
Sergeant!

31:59.709 --> 32:00.877
Sergeant Lilley!

32:05.674 --> 32:08.760
Okay. Let's do it this way.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.555
Blink once for yes, twice for no.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.224
Can you do that for me, Burgess?

32:16.852 --> 32:19.104
All right, now we're getting somewhere.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.649
Did you see what it was
that came into the camp?

32:27.737 --> 32:30.365
Okay. Did you hear it?

32:31.992 --> 32:36.121
Were you in the tent alone?

32:36.204 --> 32:38.832
This is a medical tent. Was it...

32:38.915 --> 32:41.126
Sun Mei. This was her spot.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.922
You said you weren't alone.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.258
Was the doctor in here with you?

32:48.341 --> 32:51.678
So you did see her?
Did you see what happened to her?

32:53.388 --> 32:55.599
Burgess, did you see
what happened to her?!

32:55.682 --> 32:59.060
Tell me. Did you see
what happened to her?!

32:59.144 --> 33:02.564
Did you see what happened to her?!

33:02.647 --> 33:04.608
[Lucy]
Hey! Something's coming!

33:08.570 --> 33:09.821
Stay with Burgess.

33:12.616 --> 33:13.992
Lucy!

34:00.038 --> 34:01.623
10K.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.750
That little zombie-proof son of a bitch.

34:13.593 --> 34:16.137
10K, God dammit!

34:16.221 --> 34:18.598
You got to stop leaving me like that.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.953
-Look at that.
-He's gone!

34:40.036 --> 34:41.871
-What?
-Burgess! He's gone!

34:41.955 --> 34:43.164
What?

34:55.218 --> 34:56.845
[snarling]

35:17.907 --> 35:19.784
[screaming]

35:49.314 --> 35:50.649
[snarling]

36:12.796 --> 36:13.922
Here.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.764
Clear!

36:39.572 --> 36:40.824
[roars]

37:27.537 --> 37:28.788
[no voice]

37:58.818 --> 38:00.278
[gun cocks]

38:11.080 --> 38:13.124
[gun cocking and firing]

40:42.523 --> 40:43.816
This road will take us north.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.235
We'll meet up with the other convoys
and join them to Newmerica.

40:55.203 --> 40:59.791
What the hell?

40:59.874 --> 41:01.793
Hey, Warren! What are you doing?

41:20.186 --> 41:22.480
Chief! Where are you going?!

41:24.899 --> 41:26.109
She's going east.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.611
-I thought Newmerica was north.
-That's what I thought.

41:28.695 --> 41:31.948
-No, she's going the wrong way.
-Right?

41:32.031 --> 41:33.074
Hey!

41:36.285 --> 41:38.955
Hey!

41:39.038 --> 41:41.874
Wait! Where you goin' now?

41:44.043 --> 41:46.713
Do you think she even realizes
she's going the wrong way?

41:47.714 --> 41:48.965
Not in her mind.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.722
Not you.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.475
Great.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.521
Wait! Why are you going now?

42:03.604 --> 42:07.233
Well, you know me.
I don't like it when we split up.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.609
I'm going with them.
