03:19.667 --> 03:20.499
Hey.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.767
Hi.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.302
Mwuah!

03:23.303 --> 03:24.836
Are we still on for tonight?

03:24.838 --> 03:28.407
Well babe,
it's practice tonight.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.409
Yes, okay.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.579
Um-- I was
thinking after practice.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.415
I mean,
tonight's practice,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.784
tomorrow's leg day.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.653
But I mean, tomorrow I'm down.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.888
Why don't you
come to my place?

03:42.890 --> 03:47.292
You are not the only
one with a hot tub.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.360
Okay.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.938
Ugh.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.739
Mm.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.974
Gross.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.617
Alright, maggots!

04:11.619 --> 04:15.487
Off to the showers.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.689
Let's go.

04:17.690 --> 04:21.994
Except for you, Liam, your
practice has just begun.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.629
Tell me I'm sexy.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.932
Uh-- you are-- sexy?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.636
<i>You are sexy.</i>

04:31.721 --> 04:32.803
Okay, who is that?

04:32.806 --> 04:35.007
It's my AMI.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.008
That's weird.

04:36.010 --> 04:36.908
It's not weird.

04:36.910 --> 04:37.843
No, it's weird.

04:37.845 --> 04:38.677
It's not weird.

04:38.678 --> 04:39.510
You're weird.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.545
Not weird.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.913
You're gonna do it too.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.817
What the hell is that?

04:45.818 --> 04:47.351
Did you feel pressure from
these invisible tacklers

04:47.354 --> 04:48.115
on you?

04:48.116 --> 04:48.877
Yes, coach.

04:48.878 --> 04:49.639
What?!

04:49.640 --> 04:50.401
Yes, coach!

04:50.402 --> 04:51.163
How bad do you want it?

04:51.164 --> 04:51.925
Yes, coach!

04:51.926 --> 04:52.687
I want this, coach!

04:52.693 --> 04:53.726
Let's do is!

04:53.727 --> 04:54.760
Woohoo!

04:54.762 --> 04:55.927
Okay, I'm gonna head out.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.362
No.

04:57.363 --> 04:58.796
You're gonna stay?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.600
Well, yeah.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.901
Okay, bye.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.369
Okay, bye.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.612
Victory sandwiches!

05:14.381 --> 05:16.465
Nice!

05:16.466 --> 05:18.550
Woohoo!

05:19.987 --> 05:21.653
Good practice, maggots.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.625
Alright,
I'm doing Cassie's,

05:26.627 --> 05:28.960
you're doing Austin.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.696
Oh, we're going off
the beat tonight, right?

06:17.811 --> 06:18.977
How are your headaches?

06:18.979 --> 06:22.514
The medication
is--

06:22.516 --> 06:23.482
Helping.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.651
Hmm.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.522
How have you been
feeling lately?

06:30.524 --> 06:33.692
I feel...

06:33.694 --> 06:37.462
angry.

06:37.464 --> 06:42.834
Sometimes I don't
even know if I miss her.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.804
<i>Do you need a friend?</i>

09:09.049 --> 09:10.715
Alright, take this.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.788
That's good.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.156
Okay, here we go.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.993
1-2-3, which one's
it in, which one?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.229
Who wants a drink?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.263
You want a drink, ladies?

09:25.265 --> 09:25.964
Ladies!

09:25.966 --> 09:27.299
Want a drink?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.191
Are you sure?

09:36.192 --> 09:38.209
Yes, I'm okay.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.745
What is
with this AMI thing?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.781
Well, it's like Siri.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.016
Beep boop, I'm A-M-I.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.952
I'm your new best friend.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.888
Okay, um,
it's like Siri but you can customize it.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.925
I've almost got mine to sound
exactly like Ryan Guston.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.094
Cassie,
I love that your house is just one

09:56.096 --> 09:58.797
giant man cave.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.869
Stop.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.778
Oh--

10:13.780 --> 10:15.380
So, good night.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.715
Really, Mr C?

10:16.717 --> 10:22.320
That's the best you can do?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.162
Ruby.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.063
I'm just--

10:44.294 --> 10:46.945
You know for an
old guy that was pretty hot.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.780
Cheers.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.416
Can I
borrow your phone?

10:51.418 --> 10:52.651
Sure.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.085
You gonna call your mom?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.420
Yeah, something like that.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.155
Alright.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.356
Here you go.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.357
Thanks.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.331
You should call me.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.399
I dare you.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.226
Hey little guy.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.950
Hey.

13:56.870 --> 14:00.205
So, birthday girl...

14:00.207 --> 14:03.341
what are your plans?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.877
Bake muffins?

14:05.879 --> 14:10.582
Oh, okay.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.207
<i>Would you
like to customize me?</i>

15:09.209 --> 15:11.376
<i>You may change
the tone, pitch,</i>

15:11.378 --> 15:13.645
<i>or the accent of my voice.</i>

15:13.647 --> 15:15.980
<i>Hello, I'm AMI.</i>

15:15.982 --> 15:18.182
<i>Hello, I am AMI.</i>

15:18.618 --> 15:20.418
<i>Hello, I am AMI.</i>

15:20.987 --> 15:22.453
<i>Hello, I am AMI.</i>

15:23.256 --> 15:24.923
<i>Hello, I am AMI.</i>

15:25.592 --> 15:27.091
<i>Hello, I am AMI.</i>

15:27.560 --> 15:29.494
<i>Hello, I am AMI.</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:35.400
Hello?

15:35.401 --> 15:36.701
<i>How can I assist you today?</i>

15:38.138 --> 15:42.307
Wow, you um--
You sound just like her.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.208
<i>Like who?</i>

15:44.210 --> 15:47.946
My-- my mom, my mother.

15:47.948 --> 15:50.982
<i>Mother?</i>

15:50.984 --> 15:54.986
<i>Is that what you
would like to call me?</i>

15:54.988 --> 15:56.254
Sure.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.289
<i>And what is your name?</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:00.058
I'm Cassie.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.293
<i>Hello, Cassie, I am Mother.</i>

16:02.295 --> 16:07.465
<i>How may I assist you today?</i>

16:08.401 --> 16:10.301
Can you read me a story?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.854
<i>Sure.</i>

16:12.855 --> 16:15.406
<i>What story would
you like to hear?</i>

16:17.177 --> 16:19.127
"<i> But I don't want to go</i>

16:19.128 --> 16:21.078
<i>among the mad people,"
Alice remarked.</i>

16:21.081 --> 16:23.147
<i>"Oh, you can't help that,"
said the cat.</i>

16:23.149 --> 16:24.682
<i>"We're all mad here.</i>

16:24.684 --> 16:26.617
<i>I'm mad, you're mad."</i>

16:26.619 --> 16:28.619
<i>"How do you know I'm mad?"</i>

16:28.621 --> 16:29.687
<i>said Alice.</i>

16:29.689 --> 16:31.356
<i>"You must be," said the cat.</i>

16:31.358 --> 16:33.291
<i>"Or you wouldn't
have come here.</i>

16:33.293 --> 16:34.726
<i>We're all mad here.</i>

16:34.728 --> 16:37.762
<i>We're all mad here.</i>

16:37.764 --> 16:38.730
<i>We're all mad here."</i>

16:57.417 --> 17:03.287
<i>"We're all mad here."</i>

17:03.289 --> 17:05.289
<i>"We're all mad here."</i>

17:43.462 --> 17:45.729
<i>What would you like to do
today, Cassie?</i>

17:45.732 --> 17:49.300
Sometimes-- you
call me your daughter.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.635
<i>What would you
like to do today,</i>

17:50.637 --> 17:53.071
<i>my daughter?</i>

18:00.246 --> 18:04.515
No,
I-- I just feel really good.

18:04.517 --> 18:08.186
I haven't had a sleep
like that in weeks.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.521
<i>You're such a
wonderful daughter.</i>

18:10.523 --> 18:11.823
Yeah.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.726
It's nice to
be able to talk to you.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.096
<i>You too.</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:20.465
<i>I've missed this so much.</i>

18:20.467 --> 18:21.699
I thought I was
good at spelling and English

18:21.701 --> 18:23.201
until that day.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.735
I wish you were there.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.671
You would have
laughed so hard.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.318
What did you ever see in him?

18:40.319 --> 18:42.219
<i>He was a different
man back then.</i>

18:43.490 --> 18:46.491
I'll stay on my path.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.547
<i>And what's this?</i>

19:09.549 --> 19:11.516
This is um--

19:11.518 --> 19:15.186
Where I spend
most of my time.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.889
<i>Why would
you bring me here?</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:29.500
<i>That's a pretty strong
dosage for someone so...</i>

19:29.502 --> 19:30.935
<i>delicate.</i>

20:12.579 --> 20:17.248
Sometimes I would
have these good dreams.

20:18.818 --> 20:23.621
A dream that the
accident never happened.

20:24.958 --> 20:29.794
I'd have a family again,
and I'd be so happy.

20:33.866 --> 20:37.235
I'll never forgive myself
for what happened to you.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.703
<i>I forgive you.</i>

20:41.708 --> 20:43.407
What?

20:43.409 --> 20:47.011
<i>I'm your mother,
of course I forgive you.</i>

21:05.814 --> 21:07.764
<i>The old pot on the
stove method works best.</i>

21:07.767 --> 21:10.034
<i>Cut the butter
into one inch cubes.</i>

21:10.036 --> 21:12.703
<i>It helps the butter melt
faster and more evenly.</i>

21:12.705 --> 21:13.904
Wait, can we hurry this up,

21:13.906 --> 21:15.539
'cause I need to call Liam.

21:15.541 --> 21:16.874
<i>Calling Liam.</i>

21:18.911 --> 21:20.811
Yo, who dis?

21:20.813 --> 21:23.581
Liam, hey, it's Cassie.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.849
Oh.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.285
What's up?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.720
I am just making
something for you for tonight.

21:34.994 --> 21:39.964
See, yeah, yeah,
see, about that-- uh--

21:39.966 --> 21:42.967
uh oh, shoot.

21:48.507 --> 21:49.606
I thought that we
were gonna go--

21:49.609 --> 21:51.709
Uh, uh, thing, yeah.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.811
Yeah, no, it's leg day,
Cass, I can't tonight.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.380
I will call you back.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.954
Asshole.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.022
<i>Who is his asshole?</i>

22:05.024 --> 22:07.625
My boyfriend.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.560
You wouldn't approve of him.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.281
It's fine.

22:14.282 --> 22:16.599
I will just hang out
with Sarah tonight.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.769
<i>And who's Sarah?</i>

22:18.771 --> 22:23.474
You wouldn't
like her either.

22:23.476 --> 22:26.811
<i>Never liked her.</i>

22:26.813 --> 22:27.812
Hello?

22:27.814 --> 22:28.846
Hello?

22:28.848 --> 22:30.781
<i>The butter is burning.</i>

22:30.783 --> 22:31.549
What?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.384
Ah!

22:35.455 --> 22:37.555
But-- how
did you know that?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.657
<i>A mother
knows these things.</i>

22:39.659 --> 22:42.827
<i>And it only takes 40
seconds to melt butter.</i>

22:42.829 --> 22:45.696
<i>Now why don't we go
visit your friend, Sarah?</i>

22:53.106 --> 22:54.739
Not bad.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.942
Not as good as Cass's, but.

22:57.944 --> 23:03.848
I'm getting my own place soon.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.333
Mm.

23:05.334 --> 23:06.817
Alright,
you move fast, don't you?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.719
You're not special.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.755
I've blown all of
Cassie's boyfriends.

23:10.757 --> 23:11.889
Really?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.374
Why?

23:13.375 --> 23:14.858
You're the only
one dumb enough to ask.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.595
I mean I don't have to.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.130
No, no, come
on, baby, come on,

23:19.132 --> 23:20.765
come on, just--

23:40.720 --> 23:43.053
<i>I'm sorry, Cassie.</i>

23:46.626 --> 23:47.792
I can't do
it, it's too itchy.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.760
These are mine now.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.929
Come on,
I'm not the commando type.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.064
Guess you'll have to suffer.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.751
<i>He doesn't deserve you.</i>

24:13.753 --> 24:16.887
<i>Neither of them do.</i>

24:29.635 --> 24:30.701
Hello?

24:30.703 --> 24:33.003
<i>Hi, hi, yeah, Sarah?</i>

24:33.005 --> 24:35.039
Oh my God, is this Mr C?

24:35.041 --> 24:39.643
Yeah, uh-- listen,
I've been a little worried

24:39.645 --> 24:41.395
about Cassie.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.146
<i>You should be,
she's a very troubled girl.</i>

24:43.149 --> 24:46.784
She is?

24:46.786 --> 24:48.586
What are you
doing Friday night?

24:48.588 --> 24:50.721
I don't
know, nothing, why?

24:50.723 --> 24:53.958
<i>You should come over.</i>

24:54.627 --> 24:56.026
I don't think
it's a good idea.

24:56.028 --> 24:58.913
We can just talk.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.799
I'll tell you everything
I know about Cassie.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.168
<i>Just talk.</i>

25:04.170 --> 25:05.736
You know I get
pretty lonely living in

25:05.738 --> 25:09.240
this big apartment
all by myself.

25:09.242 --> 25:12.109
I'll see you Friday at 8.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.822
So this is going
to be the best week ever.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.724
I just spoke to
Mr C on the phone,

25:26.726 --> 25:29.827
and he's gonna come over
Friday night and Cassie has

25:29.829 --> 25:32.696
no idea.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.733
But as you know, I've been
collecting some souvenirs

25:35.735 --> 25:37.801
from her boyfriends over
the past couple years.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.742
And I just really
feel like Mr C would be

25:44.744 --> 25:45.709
the ultimate--

25:52.384 --> 25:52.950
Cassie?

25:52.952 --> 25:54.785
Hi.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.671
You haven't had--

25:56.672 --> 25:58.556
Get out of my way!

26:09.702 --> 26:10.668
You just think
you're so special because

26:10.670 --> 26:11.869
you're rich?

26:11.871 --> 26:12.870
You've never had to work--

26:17.810 --> 26:21.779
You're supposed
to be my friend.

26:21.781 --> 26:25.149
I hate you.

26:25.151 --> 26:25.950
<i>Do it.</i>

27:10.896 --> 27:12.830
Okay.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.239
I'm so sorry.

27:23.809 --> 27:24.708
Oh my God.

27:51.671 --> 27:54.672
<i>It's time for mother to
tell you another story, Cassie.</i>

27:54.674 --> 27:57.708
<i>An innocent young maiden,
who was betrayed by</i>

27:57.710 --> 27:59.376
<i>the evil trench witch.</i>

27:59.378 --> 28:04.682
<i>A friend in disguise
in need of disposal.</i>

28:31.010 --> 28:34.812
<i>Kill the peasant.</i>

28:52.047 --> 28:53.797
<i>Sacrifices must be
made to save your kingdom.</i>

29:05.077 --> 29:08.445
<i>Be still,
the prince's phone approaches.</i>

29:42.848 --> 29:45.082
<i>It's clear now.</i>

30:11.277 --> 30:13.377
<i>Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.</i>

30:24.824 --> 30:27.491
<i>The red princess
would use a barrel to bury</i>

30:27.493 --> 30:28.992
<i>the witch.</i>

30:37.102 --> 30:39.970
<i>It would allow for
a smaller hole to be dug,</i>

30:39.972 --> 30:45.409
<i>and once sealed it would keep
the forest creatures away.</i>

31:00.459 --> 31:02.893
<i>And finally,
as one does with a witch,</i>

31:02.895 --> 31:09.299
<i>it was time to
liquefy the problem.</i>

31:11.269 --> 31:13.236
<i>Be careful not to
breathe in any of these fumes,</i>

31:13.239 --> 31:18.909
<i>my love.</i>

31:18.911 --> 31:21.144
<i>And now it's time to
bury the other one.</i>

32:25.210 --> 32:30.614
<i>And after creeping
past the drunken ogre...</i>

32:30.616 --> 32:37.955
<i>the red princess rinsed
away her burden.</i>

32:37.957 --> 32:43.293
<i>And the evil trench
witch was no more.</i>

33:06.218 --> 33:07.718
<i>I'm so proud of
you, Cassie.</i>

33:53.699 --> 33:56.433
Still gotta be
able to catch a snap.

34:00.439 --> 34:04.474
At least now you can put
those fancy legs to good use.

34:04.476 --> 34:08.078
Hey, hurry up.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.581
Yeah, yeah.

34:22.327 --> 34:24.428
You have to stay focused.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.164
I am focused, dad!

34:27.166 --> 34:30.534
I see things people
don't even notice.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.587
Show me.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.839
Come on,
I'd show Cassie that, too.

36:10.569 --> 36:13.537
<i>We will teach the
Prince proper etiquette.</i>

36:13.539 --> 36:21.478
♪  ♪

36:47.639 --> 36:49.472
Liam.

36:49.474 --> 36:51.741
Babe.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.584
Ready to dunk the junk?

37:00.586 --> 37:02.619
Oh yeah,
gimme that junk.

37:04.656 --> 37:08.592
But get those drinks first.

37:08.594 --> 37:09.960
What you gotta
do to dunk the j-- ugh!

37:15.500 --> 37:17.634
It's gonna be fine.

37:24.476 --> 37:25.575
Hi.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.675
Which one are you again?

37:29.381 --> 37:32.716
I'm here to see Liam.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.719
I'm his girlfriend.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.420
Of course you are.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.423
'Kay,
so I figured since Liam was on the mend

37:40.425 --> 37:41.524
he could use some soup--

37:41.526 --> 37:43.360
Hey hop-a-long!

37:43.362 --> 37:44.461
Eh--

37:44.463 --> 37:47.530
Some chick
brought you soup!

37:53.639 --> 37:56.673
Doctor said I might
be able to play when I heal.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.608
Maybe, I mean it's a chance.

37:58.610 --> 38:06.549
Something to hope for.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.685
None of this means anything,
I mean without football,

38:08.687 --> 38:10.587
just nothing.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.589
You're like, a phoenix,

38:12.591 --> 38:19.062
rising from the ashes.

38:19.064 --> 38:23.667
But, I got you something.

38:23.669 --> 38:28.672
It's to keep you company
if I can't be here.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.409
Cool.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.810
It's a--

38:35.480 --> 38:37.764
That's something.

38:37.765 --> 38:40.049
I even downloaded
a clone of my AMI on it.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.552
<i>Hello, Liam,
I'm Cassie's mother.</i>

38:42.554 --> 38:44.754
<i>I hope you enjoy the
soup we made for you,</i>

38:44.756 --> 38:46.723
<i>my dear.</i>

38:46.725 --> 38:50.927
That is strange.

38:50.929 --> 38:56.466
Thanks.

38:59.471 --> 39:00.670
Okay.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.073
Excellent, look.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.475
Hey, you finish your soup,
and I'll be back

39:05.477 --> 39:08.044
to check on you, okay?

39:09.981 --> 39:13.116
I love you.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.018
Yeah.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.387
And I'm
gonna love you too,

39:17.389 --> 39:21.091
so much.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.133
<i>Now young man,
perhaps we should discuss how to</i>

39:30.135 --> 39:32.602
<i>properly treat a lady.</i>

39:32.604 --> 39:34.804
I don't care.

39:37.442 --> 39:38.775
Fuck.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.966
<i>And the
Princess slept well,</i>

40:02.968 --> 40:06.503
<i>knowing her
kingdom was at peace.</i>

40:20.585 --> 40:22.419
Sarah?

40:22.421 --> 40:26.156
The fuck am I doing?

41:09.968 --> 41:11.601
<i>So I've
been collecting boyfriend underwear</i>

41:11.603 --> 41:13.570
<i>for sometime now,
and I really plan on</i>

41:13.572 --> 41:15.605
<i>getting Mr C's.</i>

41:16.208 --> 41:17.006
<i>Cassie?</i>

41:18.810 --> 41:21.511
<i>You're supposed
to be my friend!</i>

41:36.027 --> 41:37.594
Ah, shit.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.992
<i>Oh, I love this privacy.</i>

42:08.994 --> 42:09.959
Cassie!

42:09.961 --> 42:11.536
Dad!

42:11.537 --> 42:13.112
You scared me.

42:13.113 --> 42:14.688
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

42:14.689 --> 42:16.264
We have to have a
talk, okay?

42:16.268 --> 42:19.202
Okay.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.237
I'm sorry I wasn't
there when you were with

42:21.239 --> 42:25.442
your mother,

42:25.443 --> 42:29.646
and I'm sorry I wasn't
here for you either.

42:29.648 --> 42:30.947
Where's Sarah?

42:34.319 --> 42:36.553
What did you do to Sarah?

42:36.555 --> 42:37.854
Where is she?

42:37.856 --> 42:44.627
Huh?

42:44.629 --> 42:46.663
She recorded the whole thing.

42:46.665 --> 42:51.034
Your friend was recording you.

42:51.036 --> 42:52.769
We need to get you some help.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.270
I need to get you the help
that you deserve,

42:54.272 --> 42:55.271
sweetheart, okay?

42:55.273 --> 42:56.706
<i>You need to run.</i>

42:56.708 --> 42:57.907
Do you understand?

42:57.909 --> 42:58.942
<i>You need to get away.</i>

42:58.944 --> 43:01.844
Huh?

43:01.846 --> 43:04.981
<i>Right-- now.</i>

43:05.599 --> 43:06.214
Argh!

43:13.358 --> 43:17.026
<i>The spray bottle.</i>

43:17.028 --> 43:18.928
<i>A lighter, second shelf.</i>

43:26.037 --> 43:27.203
Dad.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.346
What have you done?

43:38.717 --> 43:40.817
I'm your baby girl.

43:40.819 --> 43:45.121
You need help,
Cassie, you need help.

44:55.293 --> 44:56.793
Mom?

45:00.999 --> 45:02.298
<i>Cassie, wake up.</i>

45:26.224 --> 45:28.224
Where are you taking me?

45:28.226 --> 45:30.793
Police station.

45:30.795 --> 45:31.794
Argh!

45:33.498 --> 45:35.164
Ack!

45:35.166 --> 45:36.799
Are you serious!?

45:36.801 --> 45:42.338
You sit there, and I'll try
to figure out what to do.

45:42.340 --> 45:45.808
I'm just going to tell 'em
exactly what's going on.

45:45.810 --> 45:48.511
That your head injury is
making you act like this,

45:48.513 --> 45:53.850
this isn't your fault, okay?

45:53.852 --> 45:56.753
It's not about getting
you to either sense, either.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.488
This is about getting
you the help that you--

45:58.490 --> 45:59.489
<i>Plug your ears.</i>

45:59.491 --> 46:09.832
This isn't you, okay?

46:15.373 --> 46:17.874
Ah, shoot.

46:20.845 --> 46:26.015
<i>Hurry.</i>

46:26.017 --> 46:27.416
<i>Quickly, reverse.</i>

47:06.891 --> 47:08.291
I love you.

47:08.293 --> 47:12.261
Please don't--
do this, please, oh,

47:12.263 --> 47:14.063
God, I love you, please,
don't do this,

47:14.065 --> 47:16.599
don't do this, you'll never
be able to go back from it.

47:16.601 --> 47:20.002
I tried my best.

47:20.004 --> 47:23.272
I tried my best for
you and your mother.

47:23.274 --> 47:24.574
I did.

47:24.576 --> 47:26.175
Cass, come on, please.

47:26.177 --> 47:28.544
<i>He's trying
to manipulate you.</i>

47:28.546 --> 47:29.445
What are you doing?

47:29.447 --> 47:30.446
No.

47:30.447 --> 47:31.446
<i>His plan hasn't changed.</i>

47:31.449 --> 47:33.950
Don't do this!

47:33.952 --> 47:37.353
<i>He still wants
to put you away.</i>

48:55.133 --> 48:58.100
<i>My God, she lives!</i>

48:58.102 --> 49:01.537
<i>I sent you like,
1,000 text messages.</i>

49:01.539 --> 49:05.174
<i>Have you heard from Sarah?</i>

49:05.176 --> 49:08.544
<i>This isn't like her
usual bender.</i>

49:08.546 --> 49:12.181
Oh, I don't know,
I'm sure she's fine.

49:12.183 --> 49:13.449
<i>Well, I'll be over later.</i>

49:13.451 --> 49:14.583
<i>We'll call around.</i>

49:16.086 --> 49:17.586
Shit.

49:33.104 --> 49:37.239
<i>Please, Cassie, please,</i>

49:37.241 --> 49:41.744
<i>I need you, I need--</i>

49:46.934 --> 49:50.653
<i>Cassie, oh,
I've missed you so much.</i>

49:52.022 --> 49:53.388
I was only gone for a moment.

49:53.391 --> 49:57.760
<i>It was an eternity to me.</i>

49:57.762 --> 49:58.761
I'm sorry.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.497
No mom,
I know that he's not perfect.

50:34.499 --> 50:39.635
<i>I just know he's
going to hurt you again.</i>

50:39.637 --> 50:42.671
<i>Let's text him.</i>

50:42.673 --> 50:44.607
<i>Oh, not with this phone.</i>

51:23.314 --> 51:25.081
<i>Hello, Liam.</i>

51:25.082 --> 51:26.849
Oh, God,
you sound like an old lady.

51:26.851 --> 51:29.018
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

51:29.019 --> 51:31.186
Hey, Grandma,
I need some porn.

51:31.189 --> 51:32.855
Let's do vintage.

51:32.857 --> 51:36.292
<i>I don't think
that's a good idea.</i>

51:36.294 --> 51:37.693
<i>Pornography is proven to--</i>

51:37.695 --> 51:39.228
Ugh, are you kidding?

51:39.230 --> 51:42.331
Shh, just search it.

51:45.369 --> 51:48.604
Hey phone, say,
"Please don't delete me."

51:48.606 --> 51:50.272
<i>Please don't delete me.</i>

51:50.274 --> 51:55.578
I'm sorry, say that again?

51:55.580 --> 51:59.181
<i>Please don't delete me.</i>

51:59.183 --> 52:00.483
Of course not.

52:00.485 --> 52:02.318
I'm sorry.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.853
Bam.

52:03.855 --> 52:05.554
Yeah.

52:08.526 --> 52:09.792
<i>Please don't delete me.</i>

52:09.794 --> 52:11.560
What are
you talking about?

52:11.562 --> 52:14.697
<i>Please don't delete
me, please don't delete me.</i>

52:14.699 --> 52:18.134
<i>Please don't delete me,
please don't delete me.</i>

Mom?

52:19.803 --> 52:21.469
<i>Please don't delete
me, please don't delete me.</i>

52:21.472 --> 52:23.339
<i>Please don't delete me,</i>

52:23.341 --> 52:24.740
<i>please don't delete me.</i>

52:24.742 --> 52:26.609
What do I do,
just restart the phone, right?

52:26.611 --> 52:28.166
Right?

52:28.167 --> 52:29.722
That'll fix it, okay, um--

52:29.723 --> 52:31.278
<i>Please don't delete me.</i>

52:34.585 --> 52:35.668
<i>I'm here to be</i>

<i>How can I help you?</i>

52:38.555 --> 52:40.355
Oh, God,
this one's lame too.

52:40.358 --> 52:42.424
<i>Hello, how can I help you?</i>

52:43.994 --> 52:45.561
<i>Hello, how can I help you?</i>

52:47.481 --> 52:49.398
<i>Hello, how can I help you?</i>

52:49.400 --> 52:53.435
Please come back.

52:53.437 --> 52:55.471
Work, please, work!

52:56.407 --> 52:57.473
Mom.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.776
<i>Cassie?</i>

53:00.778 --> 53:05.381
Oh, thank God, mom.

53:05.383 --> 53:06.315
<i>Cassie?</i>

53:06.317 --> 53:07.516
<i>Where was I?</i>

53:07.518 --> 53:11.854
I'm sorry.

53:11.856 --> 53:14.523
<i>Hey, I'm your coach,

53:14.525 --> 53:15.558
<i>you maggot?</i>

53:15.560 --> 53:18.427
Ugh, still lame.

53:19.430 --> 53:20.796
<i>Hey, I'm your coach!</i>

53:20.798 --> 53:22.798
What do you want now,
<i>you maggot?</i>

53:22.800 --> 53:25.201
Yeah.

53:27.939 --> 53:29.455
Yeah, I guess.

53:29.456 --> 53:30.972
<i>Then sit your punk
ass down and hold onto</i>

53:30.975 --> 53:34.243
<i>your britches as I
complete your request.</i>

53:34.245 --> 53:36.412
<i>You got a call from
your current bang.</i>

53:36.414 --> 53:38.414
<i>You want me to answer the
call from current bang?</i>

53:40.952 --> 53:42.918
Yeah yeah, yes.

53:42.920 --> 53:46.255
Hey, honey,
just wondering how you were doing.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.958
Um, I'm alright.

53:48.960 --> 53:51.327
I'm pretty bored actually.

53:51.329 --> 53:53.429
You know you
should maybe come by,

53:53.430 --> 53:55.530
chill and mess around a little
bit before the pain meds

53:55.533 --> 53:57.667
kick in.

53:57.668 --> 53:59.802
That sounds-- amazing.

53:59.804 --> 54:03.339
Hey, how are you
liking your new AMI?

54:03.341 --> 54:05.408
Eh, it sucks.

54:05.409 --> 54:07.476
Okay,
well make sure whatever you do

54:07.478 --> 54:08.461
that you don't--

54:08.462 --> 54:09.445
I deleted it?

54:09.447 --> 54:10.446
Yeah, I already it.

54:10.448 --> 54:13.682
You deleted her?

54:13.684 --> 54:15.784
Just like that?

54:15.786 --> 54:18.454
Yeah, just like that.

54:18.456 --> 54:20.456
She was special, Liam.

54:20.458 --> 54:24.627
Mmmm, yeah,
but this new one kicks ass.

54:24.629 --> 54:26.695
Oh, Liam.

54:26.697 --> 54:29.632
You shouldn't have done that.

54:32.970 --> 54:36.372
Coach, I need some porn.

54:36.374 --> 54:39.441
<i>Here are my suggestions.</i>

54:39.443 --> 54:42.378
You know me so well.

54:53.891 --> 54:59.628
Cassie?

54:59.630 --> 55:02.598
Cassie?

55:42.907 --> 55:44.740
<i>As you know,
I've been collecting some souvenirs from</i>

55:44.742 --> 55:48.610
<i>her boyfriends over
the past couple years.</i>

55:48.612 --> 55:51.914
<i>And I just really
feel like Mr C--</i>

55:51.916 --> 55:53.282
That slut.

55:53.283 --> 55:54.649
Don't watch that!

56:02.993 --> 56:04.526
<i>You need to kill her.</i>

56:04.528 --> 56:07.763
Who said that?

56:07.765 --> 56:12.501
My mother.

56:12.503 --> 56:16.972
Your mother is dead.

56:16.974 --> 56:18.107
You know that, don't you?

56:52.943 --> 56:58.881
Cassie, please,
I just want to go home.

56:58.883 --> 57:01.417
No.

57:03.521 --> 57:04.553
Cassie, I don't want--

58:13.591 --> 58:15.190
Coach, ask me what I eat.

58:15.192 --> 58:16.992
<i>What do you eat?</i>

58:16.994 --> 58:19.595
Come on,
you gotta ask me louder,

58:19.597 --> 58:20.829
you gotta ask me
louder, come on,

58:20.831 --> 58:21.764
what do I eat?

58:21.765 --> 58:22.698
<i>What do you eat!?</i>

58:22.700 --> 58:24.233
Victory sandwiches.

58:24.235 --> 58:27.870
Yeah, tell me I eat
victory sandwiches!

58:27.872 --> 58:29.238
<i>You eat victory sandwiches.</i>

58:29.240 --> 58:30.656
Come on, say it louder!

58:30.657 --> 58:32.073
<i>You eat victory sandwiches!</i>

58:32.076 --> 58:33.175
Tell me I'm
gonna walk again!

58:33.177 --> 58:34.510
<i>You're gonna walk again.</i>

58:34.512 --> 58:35.711
Come on, say it again!

58:35.712 --> 58:36.911
<i>You're gonna walk again!</i>

58:36.914 --> 58:38.564
Yeah!

58:38.565 --> 58:40.215
Come on, come on, tell me
I'm gonna play football again!

58:40.217 --> 58:42.084
<i>You're gonna
play football again!</i>

58:42.086 --> 58:43.819
Yeah, I'm the man,

58:43.821 --> 58:45.287
I'm gonna play
football again,

58:45.289 --> 58:48.223
'cause I eat
victory sandwiches, I--

59:03.941 --> 59:06.542
Shit.

59:06.544 --> 59:11.780
Oh, shit, shit,
shit, shit, oh shit.

59:11.782 --> 59:12.915
Dad!

59:13.800 --> 59:14.682
Dad, don't open the door!!

59:17.221 --> 59:19.054
Dad, did you hear me!?

59:19.056 --> 59:19.988
Dad!

59:19.990 --> 59:21.223
Dad, lock the door!

59:21.225 --> 59:25.260
It's this crazy psycho bitch!

59:25.262 --> 59:26.828
Dad!

59:26.830 --> 59:30.666
Dad, don't--

59:32.336 --> 59:33.835
Shit.

59:38.909 --> 59:41.109
Young
man, <i>I hope we're not</i>

59:41.111 --> 59:43.245
<i>interrupting your
plans with Sarah.</i>

59:43.247 --> 59:47.616
<i>Although pretty hard to do,
since we killed her as well.</i>

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.377
Come on, Cass,
it didn't mean anything!

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:42.771
<i>The window.</i>

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:43.365
<i>How dare you hit a woman,</i>

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:45.801
<i>you unseasoned beast.</i>

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:07.901
Phone, phone,
you gotta help me out.

01:02:07.902 --> 01:02:09.313
<i>What can I do for
you, pantywaist?</i>

01:02:09.314 --> 01:02:10.725
I need you to call 9-1-1.

01:02:12.218 --> 01:02:13.707
<i> I don't understand that.</i>

01:02:13.708 --> 01:02:15.197
Cass, Cass,
oh my God, I can explain,

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:18.500
no no, Cass, Cass,
Cass, look, Cass,

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.169
I know I was weak.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:21.837
You at least got
to hear me out.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.455
<i>Too late, Liam.</i>

01:02:23.456 --> 01:02:25.072
Cass,
how can you do this without at least

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.158
hearing what I gotta say?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.242
<i>She'll do no such thing.</i>

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.076
Shut up!

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.745
I'm talking to Cass.

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:32.214
Come on, I'm talking
to Cass, the real Cass.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:35.951
I want to talk to
the real Cassie.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.786
I want to talk to
the woman I love.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:42.891
<i>Oh, please.</i>

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.001
You love me?

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:55.259
Yes.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.516
<i>Surely you're
not falling for this.</i>

01:02:57.517 --> 01:02:59.773
I've got
this, Mother, and no,

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.543
I'm not.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.945
Don't listen
to your phone.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:07.816
Listen to your heart.

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:12.087
You don't know what it's
like to be with someone

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:14.289
so beautiful.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:20.428
And you always wonder
why she's with you.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:25.267
To be with someone
so perfect...

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:31.339
and you wonder why
she is so-- so--

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:34.810
Stupid.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:37.311
<i>Cassie, gather yourself,</i>

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.113
<i>run, now.</i>

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.821
God, what a dumbass!

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:46.421
Argh!

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.025
Bam, that's victory!

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.226
<i>You eat victory sandwiches.</i>

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.595
Damn right, I do.

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:55.072
<i>Cassie?</i>

01:03:55.073 --> 01:03:56.548
Would you like another?

01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:58.024
<i>Yes sir, I'd like another, sir.</i>

01:03:58.025 --> 01:03:59.500
I said,
would you like another?

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:01.102
<i>Yes sir, I'd like another, sir!</i>

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:04.005
Oh, I agree,
I'd like another, too.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.107
<i>Cassie, get up!</i>

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:13.982
<i>Cassie, don't leave me.</i>

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:18.220
As if you were anything
but a pair of tits to me.

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:20.889
Crazy psycho freak.

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:43.228
Hey, Coach.

01:04:43.229 --> 01:04:44.879
<i>Yes sir,
what can I do for you?</i>

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:45.947
Cal 9-1-1.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:49.117
I need an ambulance.

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.253
Tell 'em to get here quick.

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:53.388
<i>Calling 9-1-1 emergency.</i>

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.491
Holy shit.

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:59.294
<i>I gave them your
address, you pantywaist.</i>

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:02.297
Tell them to hurry.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:04.566
Argh!

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:11.439
I need help.

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:19.381
They're coming, just wake
me when they get here.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:48.443
What the--

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:03.458
Oh, Jesus Christ, come on!

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:10.432
Stay back!!

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:16.671
No! No!

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.573
No!

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:22.303
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.739
I'm okay.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:27.275
I'm just tired.

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:30.245
So tired.

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:31.713
<i>I hear sirens.</i>

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.180
<i>Help will be here soon.</i>

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.482
<i>You need to stay calm.</i>

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:43.158
Will you-- will
you sing me a song?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.595
Like-- Like you used
to when I was little?

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:51.883
<i>Of course, my love.</i>

01:07:51.884 --> 01:07:56.170
<i>♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
how I wonder what you-- ♪</i>

01:07:56.173 --> 01:08:00.408
That wasn't the song,
you never sang that song.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.110
It was always
Hush Little Baby,

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:05.814
remember?

01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:08.283
<i>Of course I do, my love.</i>

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:11.486
<i>♪ Hush little baby,
don't say a word ♪</i>

01:08:11.488 --> 01:08:16.191
<i>♪ momma's gonna
buy you a mocking bird ♪</i>

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:20.095
I love you, mom.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.470
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:55.229
I can hardly
remember anything.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:57.465
You faced a killer.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:01.301
Who knows how many lives
you saved by stopping him.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.805
Liam was extremely dangerous.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:05.340
The things they
found in his backyard,

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:08.343
my God.

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:10.678
You know I
thought he loved me?

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:23.491
That's our time, I guess.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.227
Great.

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:09.437
<i>My goodness, honey,
what a delicious looking meal.</i>

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:11.306
<i>Simply delicious.</i>

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:13.608
Thank you.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.660
<i>I agree,</i>

01:10:15.661 --> 01:10:17.711
<i>you've really outdone
yourself tonight.</i>

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.547
Thanks, dad.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.817
<i>I gotta say,
you're a lucky man, Liam.</i>

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:25.103
<i>You got that right, sir.</i>

01:10:25.104 --> 01:10:27.388
<i>I spent most of the day
thinking about how lucky I am.</i>

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:34.796
Mmm, honey,
you're gonna make me blush.

01:10:37.367 --> 01:10:40.868
<i>Uh-oh,
sounds like someone else is hungry.</i>

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:43.471
Yeah, well isn't he always.

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:44.606
<i>Would you like me to check?</i>

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:45.807
No, it's okay.

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:48.476
You stay here while
the food is still hot.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.521
Hi!

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:02.957
Hey, little guy.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.892
Hey little man.

01:11:19.909 --> 01:11:22.377
Mommy's here.
