00:08.842 --> 00:10.744
Woman:
JUST LET ME CHECK.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.414
HER 16th BIRTHDAY
STARTED FIVE MINUTES AGO.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.416
OH, LOOK, HILDA.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.585
SHE'S LEVITATING.

00:18.651 --> 00:20.153
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.021
LET'S TELL HER
SHE'S A WITCH.

00:22.088 --> 00:23.523
NO. LET HER SLEEP.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.226
SHE STARTS
A NEW SCHOOL TOMORROW.

00:26.292 --> 00:28.695
BESIDES, THE FIRST
LEVITATION IS SO SPECIAL.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.064
YEAH, THEN IT
GETS OLD REAL QUICK.

00:32.565 --> 00:35.235
I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR LITTLE
NIECE IS GROWING UP.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.636
WAIT TILL SABRINA FINDS OUT

00:36.703 --> 00:39.038
WHAT NEW DOORS THIS
WILL OPEN FOR HER.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.508
WAIT TILL SHE FINDS OUT
YOU STILL GET ZITS

00:41.574 --> 00:42.742
WHEN YOU'RE 600.

00:42.809 --> 00:46.746
WELL, WE'D BETTER GO
BEFORE SHE WAKES UP.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.148
SO SWEET...

00:48.214 --> 00:50.350
SO INNOCENT.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.552
JUST THE PERFECT
LITTLE WITCH.

00:53.853 --> 00:58.057
[Captioning sponsored by
VIACOM PRODUCTIONS]

01:10.837 --> 01:12.839
THIS IS NOT ME.

01:18.611 --> 01:19.712
MORNING.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.648
GOOD MORNING.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
SABRINA.

01:21.714 --> 01:23.082
AND MANY MORE
TO COME.

01:23.149 --> 01:24.317
MANY, MANY
MORE TO COME.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.552
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

01:25.618 --> 01:26.653
ACTUALLY

01:26.719 --> 01:28.121
THAT'S FROM BOTH OF US.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.622
I JUST FORGOT
TO SIGN THE CARD.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.459
HOPE YOU DON'T
ALREADY HAVE ONE.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.562
A BLACK POT.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.664
ACTUALLY, I DON'T.

01:37.730 --> 01:38.865
THANKS.

01:38.932 --> 01:39.833
IT'S A CAULDRON.

01:39.899 --> 01:41.234
WOW.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.803
EVEN BETTER.
I CAN PUT MY PENS IN IT.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.371
THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT'S FOR.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.207
SABRINA, WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.508
YOU SEE, THERE ARE

01:48.575 --> 01:51.277
TWO REALMS-- THE NATURAL
AND THE SUPERNATURAL

01:51.344 --> 01:53.313
AND THE IMMUTABLE
LAWS OF PHYSICS...

01:53.379 --> 01:54.380
YOU'RE A WITCH.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.783
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M A WITCH?

01:56.850 --> 01:58.351
YOU'RE A WITCH.

01:58.418 --> 01:59.552
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.387
I'M A WITCH.
HILDA'S A WITCH.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.889
YOUR FATHER'S A WITCH.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.158
AND I SUPPOSE
MY MOM'S A WITCH TOO?

02:05.225 --> 02:06.292
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.293
YOUR MOM'S MORTAL.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.728
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE--

02:08.795 --> 02:11.331
SO THAT WE CAN TEACH
YOU TO USE YOUR MAGIC.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.266
YOU KNOW,
FOR A SECOND THERE

02:13.333 --> 02:15.668
YOU ALMOST MADE ME FORGET

02:15.735 --> 02:18.304
ABOUT MY FIRST DAY
OF SCHOOL. THANKS.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.640
BUT... NOW I'VE GOT
TO GO CATCH A BUS

02:20.707 --> 02:22.408
TO TAKE ME TO MY DOOM.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.710
BYE-BYE. HAVE FUN.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.513
AND DON'T MAKE TOO
MANY HAND GESTURES.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.717
MY AUNTS TRY HARD

02:30.783 --> 02:33.386
BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT...

02:33.453 --> 02:34.754
THEY'RE PRETTY WEIRD.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.626
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

02:52.705 --> 02:54.173
SUMMER'S OVER.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.309
COME ON IN.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.177
I'M MR. POOL.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.646
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

02:59.712 --> 03:01.314
AND I KNOW YOU
WERE HOPING

03:01.381 --> 03:03.316
I WAS GOING
TO SPEND THE DAY

03:03.383 --> 03:04.851
MISPRONOUNCING YOUR NAMES.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.887
BUT INSTEAD LET'S JUST
JUMP RIGHT INTO BIOLOGY.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.356
THE FROG IS
A COLD-BLOODED VERTEBRATE.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.759
AS WE DISSECT
THIS AMPHIBIAN

03:12.825 --> 03:13.927
WE'LL BE LOOKING

03:13.993 --> 03:15.595
FOR THE KIDNEYS

03:15.662 --> 03:17.330
THE HEART... AND MY LOST YOUTH.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.799
IF YOU'LL EACH
CHOOSE UP A LAB PARTNER...

03:21.801 --> 03:24.804
OR I COULD PAIR
YOU OFF BY HEIGHT.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.372
THANK YOU.

03:26.439 --> 03:27.740
HEY, YOU WANT TO...

03:27.807 --> 03:28.775
HARVEY...

03:28.841 --> 03:31.477
I'LL BE YOUR LAB PARTNER.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.750
Girl:
LET'S NAME HIM TAD.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.752
TAD POLE.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.254
OKAY.

03:41.321 --> 03:43.923
HEY, THANKS FOR ASKING ME
TO BE YOUR LAB PARTNER.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.458
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.460
I WAS THE NEW KID LAST YEAR.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.728
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

03:48.795 --> 03:50.964
DO YOU EVER FEEL
LIKE YOU DON'T FIT IN?

03:51.030 --> 03:52.498
ONLY ALL THE TIME

03:52.565 --> 03:54.300
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO FIT IT.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.435
I'VE RESEARCHED IT

03:55.501 --> 03:56.769
AND AWKWARD PEOPLE

03:56.836 --> 04:00.506
TEND TO BE MUCH
MORE SUCCESSFUL
LATER IN LIFE.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.242
I LOOK AT LIBBY,
I SEE TRAGEDY.

04:03.309 --> 04:07.580
OH. LOOK, GIRLS, YOU'VE
BORED YOUR FROG TO DEATH.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.616
WELL, SLICE AND DICE.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.785
OH, I HATE DOING THIS.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.487
IF ONLY I COULD BRING

04:14.554 --> 04:15.688
THESE FROGS BACK TO LIFE.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.991
I THINK HIS HEART
IS SOMEWHERE AROUND...

04:20.627 --> 04:22.362
LOOK, TAD'S ALIVE.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.430
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

04:24.497 --> 04:25.965
IT'S FRANKEN-FROG.

04:26.032 --> 04:28.301
MR. POOL, OURS IS STILL KICKING.

04:29.669 --> 04:32.772
MIKE FROM CADAVER SHACK'S
GOING TO HEAR FROM ME.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.908
CAN YOU BELIEVE
HOW YOUNG THE FRESHMEN LOOK?

04:37.644 --> 04:39.045
MAY WE HELP YOU?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.514
I JUST WANTED
TO WASH MY HANDS.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.316
YOU KNOW, FROG JUICE.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.919
YOU KNOW...

04:46.986 --> 04:48.454
IF YOU STINK

04:48.521 --> 04:50.857
I'M NOT SURE IT'S FAIR
TO BLAME THE FROG.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.559
WELL, AT LEAST I DON'T
SPLASH ON AFTERSHAVE

04:53.626 --> 04:56.596
TO REMIND ME OF SOME BOY
WHO DUMPED ME LAST SUMMER.

04:56.663 --> 04:57.630
HOW DID

04:57.697 --> 04:59.732
YOU KNOW THAT?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.367
I DON'T KNOW.

05:01.434 --> 05:05.505
MY INCREDIBLE SENSE
OF SMELL TOLD ME?

05:05.571 --> 05:07.407
YEAH, RIGHT.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.641
I BETTER GET GOING.

05:08.708 --> 05:09.976
SMELL YOU LATER.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.444
WAIT.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.880
DON'T COME IN HERE AGAIN.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.314
FROM NOW ON

05:15.381 --> 05:18.685
YOU USE THE FREAKS' BATHROOM.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.789
(<i> gasps</i> )

05:25.858 --> 05:27.627
AH!

05:32.098 --> 05:33.833
Sabrina:
<i>HI.</i>

05:33.900 --> 05:35.001
I'M HOME.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.003
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.971
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

05:39.038 --> 05:40.740
OH, LOOK, A PARTY.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.442
SORT OF.

05:42.508 --> 05:46.345
OH, LOOK, YOU PUT SALEM
IN A LITTLE PARTY HAT.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.347
THAT'S SO CUTE.

05:48.414 --> 05:52.652
HERE IS A PRESENT
FROM YOUR FATHER.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.589
AN OLD BOOK, A BLACK POT...

05:56.656 --> 05:58.791
DOESN'T ANYONE SHOP
AT THE GAP ANYMORE?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.960
<i>"THE DISCOVERY OF MAGIC."</i>

06:01.027 --> 06:03.029
WHY DID HE GIVE ME THIS?

06:04.163 --> 06:05.798
THAT'S WHY.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.601
THIS OLD MAGICIAN
LOOKS JUST LIKE MY DAD.

06:08.668 --> 06:09.635
<i>SURPRISE.</i>

06:09.702 --> 06:11.971
<i>IT IS YOUR DAD.</i>

06:12.038 --> 06:14.073
<i>HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SABRINA.</i>

06:14.140 --> 06:16.042
HALLMARK HAS GONE
REALLY HIGH TECH.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.543
CAN HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.545
<i>I'M NOT A HOLOGRAM, HONEY.</i>

06:19.612 --> 06:21.681
<i>I'M JUST IN A DIFFERENT REALM.</i>

06:21.748 --> 06:25.017
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT
THE TORONTO MIDWAY MOTOR LODGE.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.755
ZELDA, HILDA, DIDN'T YOU EXPLAIN
<i>TO HER SHE'S A WITCH?</i>

06:28.821 --> 06:30.490
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE US.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.624
NOT THIS AGAIN.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.927
I KNOW YOU WENT TO A LOT
OF TROUBLE TO SET THIS JOKE UP

06:34.994 --> 06:36.162
SO... HA! HA! HA!

06:36.229 --> 06:37.497
NOW IT'S OVER.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.798
NO, IT'S JUST BEGINNING.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.133
YOU ARE A WITCH.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.701
WITH REAL
MAGICAL POWERS.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.536
AND NOW THAT
YOU'RE 16

06:43.603 --> 06:44.470
YOU CAN USE THEM.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.673
AND YOU WANTED
SOMETHING
FROM THE GAP.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.408
SO, I'M NOT WHO I THINK I AM?

06:49.475 --> 06:51.077
YOU'RE NOT WHO I THINK YOU ARE?

06:51.144 --> 06:52.879
AND MY FATHER LIVES IN A BOOK?

06:52.945 --> 06:54.580
FINALLY, SHE GETS IT.

06:54.647 --> 06:55.581
THIS IS INSANE.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.583
COME ON, SALEM.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.653
CAN YOU WAIT TILL
I FINISH MY MILK?

07:02.488 --> 07:03.790
DID THE CAT JUST TALK?

07:03.856 --> 07:04.857
YES.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.527
AND GET THIS STUPID HAT
OFF MY HEAD.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.528
OH, MY GOD!

07:08.594 --> 07:12.732
I THINK WE BETTER LET
HER FATHER HANDLE THIS.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.801
TED...

07:19.972 --> 07:22.141
(<i> screams</i> )

07:23.075 --> 07:24.210
<i>SABRINA, OPEN ME UP.</i>

07:24.277 --> 07:25.645
NO.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.480
<i>YOUNG LADY,</i>
<i>OPEN ME THIS INSTANT!</i>

07:27.547 --> 07:29.448
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO A BOOK.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.617
OH, GOD, I'M TALKING TO A BOOK.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.719
I CAN'T BE A WITCH.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.922
WITCHES DON'T EXIST.

07:35.988 --> 07:38.724
<i>HONEY, I KNOW</i>
<i>THIS IS HARD</i>

07:38.791 --> 07:40.626
<i>BUT YOU JUST HAVE</i>
<i>TO ACCEPT IT.</i>

07:40.693 --> 07:42.161
<i>YOU'RE NOT LIKE OTHER KIDS.</i>

07:42.228 --> 07:43.529
<i>YOU'RE SPECIAL.</i>

07:43.596 --> 07:45.198
I DON'T WANT TO BE SPECIAL.

07:45.264 --> 07:46.599
I WANT TO BE NORMAL.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.602
<i>I UNDERSTAND,</i>
<i>BUT THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.</i>

07:49.669 --> 07:52.038
ALL THESE YEARS I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TRAVELING

07:52.104 --> 07:53.773
WITH THE FOREIGN SERVICE.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.143
<i>I AM. IT'S JUST A LOT MORE</i>
<i>FOREIGN THAN YOU THOUGHT.</i>

07:57.210 --> 07:58.611
AND MOM?

07:58.678 --> 08:01.247
HAS SHE REALLY BEEN DIGGING
FOR FOSSILS IN PERU?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.615
<i>YES, SHE IS.</i>

08:02.682 --> 08:04.717
THEN I WANT
TO GO LIVE WITH HER.

08:04.784 --> 08:05.985
<i>YOU CAN'T. THERE'S A RULE.</i>

08:06.052 --> 08:09.655
<i>IF YOU SET EYES ON YOUR MOTHER</i>
<i>IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS</i>

08:09.722 --> 08:11.657
<i>SHE'LL TURN INTO A BALL OF WAX.</i>

08:11.724 --> 08:12.158
WHAT?

08:12.225 --> 08:13.626
<i>IT'S THE WAY</i>

08:13.693 --> 08:15.228
<i>THEY DISCOURAGE</i>
<i>MORTAL-WITCH MARRIAGES.</i>

08:15.294 --> 08:17.830
IS THAT THE REASON
YOU AND MOM GOT DIVORCED?

08:17.897 --> 08:18.998
<i>NO.</i>

08:19.065 --> 08:20.066
SO, DO YOU THINK

08:20.132 --> 08:21.801
YOU CAN GET BACK TOGETHER?

08:21.868 --> 08:23.102
<i>NO.</i>

08:23.169 --> 08:25.771
<i>THAT'S ANOTHER SHIP</i>
<i>THAT'S SAILED.</i>

08:25.838 --> 08:27.106
<i>YOU'RE GOING</i>

08:27.173 --> 08:28.674
<i>TO BE FINE.</i>

08:28.741 --> 08:31.811
<i>JUST TAKE SOME TIME</i>
<i>AND THINK ABOUT ALL THIS.</i>

08:31.878 --> 08:34.146
<i>IF YOU EVER NEED ME...</i>

08:34.213 --> 08:35.882
<i>I'M IN THE INDEX.</i>

08:38.985 --> 08:41.220
I CALL. FIVE ACES.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.655
YOU CHEAT.

08:42.722 --> 08:43.656
DO NOT.

08:43.723 --> 08:44.757
DO TOO.

08:44.824 --> 08:48.694
OKAY, I'VE TALKED TO MY DAD,
AND I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.264
AND I GUESS
I BELIEVE I'M A WITCH.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.732
GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU ARE.

08:53.799 --> 08:54.901
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:54.967 --> 08:56.602
LET'S TRY SOME MAGIC.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.771
SABRINA,
YOU STAND RIGHT THERE.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.139
HILDA, YOU STAY THERE.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.875
ALL RIGHT, LET'S START
WITH THE BASICS.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.210
ORANGE INTO APPLE.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.545
NOW, YOU CONCENTRATE
AND POINT.

09:06.612 --> 09:07.813
COME ON, TRY IT.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.088
APPLE... PINEAPPLE.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.857
THAT'S VERY CLOSE.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.625
NO, IT'S NOT.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.727
TRY AGAIN.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.733
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.336
YOU TOLD ME THE 23rd TIME
IS THE CHARM.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.838
YOU'LL LEARN
TO CONTROL YOUR MAGIC.

09:32.905 --> 09:33.839
AT THE VERY LEAST

09:33.906 --> 09:37.043
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE ABLE
TO GARNISH A HAM STEAK.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.844
ONE MORE TRY.

09:40.646 --> 09:41.714
SALEM INTO APPLE.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.716
THAT'S ENOUGH
FOR ONE NIGHT.

09:43.783 --> 09:44.984
THE CAT'S RIGHT.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.185
WRAP IT UP.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.887
YOU'VE GOT
SCHOOL TOMORROW.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.122
I'M A WITCH AND I STILL
HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL?

09:50.189 --> 09:51.190
MM-HMM.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.259
MAYBE I'LL TURN
MR. POOL INTO...

09:53.326 --> 09:54.760
NOW, BE CAREFUL.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.630
POINTING YOUR FINGER AT
PEOPLE COULD BE DANGEROUS.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.365
YOU'RE POINTING AT ME.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.033
I HAVE THE SAFETY ON.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.607
(<i> alarm sounds</i> )

10:10.142 --> 10:11.310
GOOD MORNING.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.311
MORNING.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.312
PINEAPPLE?

10:13.379 --> 10:14.714
YOU'LL BE LATE.

10:14.780 --> 10:15.748
I'M A WITCH.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.383
CAN'T I JUST TURN BACK TIME?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.318
UH-UH. A WITCH
CAN'T CHANGE TIME.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.886
THAT'S ONE OF THE RULES.

10:20.953 --> 10:21.754
YOU'RE KIDDING?

10:21.821 --> 10:23.055
NOPE.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.156
GOT TO GO.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.092
YOU ALSO CAN'T
GET RID OF CELLULITE.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.626
I GOT A JOKE.

10:27.693 --> 10:28.761
KNOCK KNOCK.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.096
WHO'S THERE?

10:30.162 --> 10:31.097
BRAD.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.264
BRAD WHO?

10:32.331 --> 10:33.632
BRAD PITT.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.002
IS THERE ANY OTHER BRAD
WORTH MENTIONING?

10:36.068 --> 10:37.636
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.105
DID YOU ENJOY
THAT POP QUIZ?

10:39.171 --> 10:40.706
I AM SO BAD AT HISTORY.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.808
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO REMEMBER THINGS

10:42.875 --> 10:44.410
THAT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.678
Boy:
HEADS UP!

10:47.346 --> 10:49.115
WATCH IT
WITH THE FOOTBALL.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.916
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:50.983 --> 10:53.285
TRY TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD,
NOT JUST YOUR OWN.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.720
FREAK.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.659
CAN I SIT HERE?

11:00.726 --> 11:01.794
SURE.

11:03.062 --> 11:03.963
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

11:04.030 --> 11:05.831
UM, IT KIND OF HURTS.

11:05.898 --> 11:06.966
SORRY.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.901
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT YOU.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.302
OH, THAT WAS YOU?

11:10.369 --> 11:12.371
YOU HAVE A REALLY
GOOD ARM.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.939
THANKS.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.075
OH, DO YOU KNOW JENNY?

11:16.142 --> 11:18.911
YOU LIVE IN THE HOUSE
WITH THE FUNNY MAILBOX, RIGHT?

11:18.978 --> 11:20.246
IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.681
THE PEOPLE WHO
LIVED THERE BEFORE US

11:22.748 --> 11:24.850
WERE ACTUALLY NAMED
MR. AND MRS. HOGG.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.052
NO, IT'S CUTE.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.453
MY MAILBOX IS BORING.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.089
IT'S REALLY JUST A PLACE
TO PUT LETTERS.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.157
MINE TOO.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.427
HARVEY, I'M
HAVING A PARTY

11:34.493 --> 11:35.861
SATURDAY NIGHT.

11:35.928 --> 11:36.996
YOU'LL BE THERE, RIGHT?

11:37.063 --> 11:39.465
SURE. I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING ELSE.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.466
PERFECT.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.468
EVERYONE COOL
IS COMING.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.072
WELL, THAT'S ALL.

11:47.406 --> 11:48.407
OH, NO.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.943
SMELL YOU LATER.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.078
YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.813
PROVE IT.

11:53.879 --> 11:54.980
DON'T WALK AWAY.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.183
I'M NOT DONE TALKING WITH YOU!

11:57.249 --> 11:59.151
YOU! YOU! YOU!

12:15.534 --> 12:16.902
WHERE DID LIBBY GO?

12:16.969 --> 12:20.039
I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.516
GOODIE, THERE'S
A LECTURE AT M.I.T.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.885
ON THE HEISENBERG
UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.453
IT'S EITHER AT 8:00
OR AT 10:00.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.354
(<i> door slams</i> )

12:35.421 --> 12:36.889
I HATE BEING A WITCH!

12:36.956 --> 12:40.192
I JUST TURNED THE MOST
POPULAR GIRL IN SCHOOL

12:40.259 --> 12:41.460
INTO A PINEAPPLE!

12:41.527 --> 12:42.094
WHY?

12:42.161 --> 12:43.963
IT'S THE ONLY THING I KNOW.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.231
CHILL.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.233
I CAN FIX THIS.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.436
CHUNKS OR RINGS?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.171
HILDA... THERE
ARE OTHER WAYS.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.439
WEDGES?

12:53.506 --> 12:56.342
SABRINA DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO SEAL HER SPELLS YET

12:56.408 --> 12:58.277
SO...

12:58.344 --> 13:01.914
THE POPULAR GIRL
IS NOT A FRUIT.

13:03.916 --> 13:04.950
THERE.

13:05.017 --> 13:06.285
ALL BETTER.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.888
WHAT AM I DOING
IN YOUR HOUSE?

13:08.954 --> 13:11.023
YOU... CAME OVER
FOR A VISIT.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.192
I WOULD NOT.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.228
YOU DID SOMETHING TO ME.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.997
YOU SENT ME SOMEWHERE.

13:18.063 --> 13:21.133
IT WAS SMALL AND IT SMELLED
LIKE HAWAII.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.968
LOOK, LIBBY, I'M SORRY...

13:23.035 --> 13:25.471
NOT AS SORRY AS YOU WILL BE.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.840
YOU'RE AN EVEN BIGGER
FREAK THAN I THOUGHT

13:27.907 --> 13:30.442
AND THE WHOLE SCHOOL'S GOING
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.914
SEE, MY WAY, SHE'D
BE ON A TOOTHPICK.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.048
IT'S OVER.

13:36.115 --> 13:36.982
MY LIFE IS OVER.

13:37.049 --> 13:40.519
I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST OVER--
IT'S OVER-OVER!

13:40.586 --> 13:42.021
OH, STOP...

13:42.087 --> 13:43.522
LIBBY CAN'T HURT YOU.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.025
SHE'S JUST ONE PERSON
WITH A CRAZY STORY.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.960
SHE'S A CHEERLEADER.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.129
NOBODY HAS MORE
CREDIBILITY.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.264
I'D HAVE TO TURN BACK TIME
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.966
YOU SAID A WITCH
CAN'T DO THAT.

13:54.033 --> 13:54.833
<i>A</i> WITCH CAN'T

13:54.900 --> 13:57.102
BUT COLLECTIVELY,
WE DO HAVE POWERS

13:57.169 --> 13:58.971
THAT A SINGLE WITCH DOESN'T.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.239
IT'S A UNION THING.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.341
SO IT'S POSSIBLE?

14:02.408 --> 14:04.410
YOU CAN APPEAL TO
THE WITCHES' COUNCIL

14:04.476 --> 14:06.178
BUT THEY ONLY GRANT
TIME REVERSAL

14:06.245 --> 14:07.179
IN EXTREME CASES.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.214
LIKE FOR TWO MONTHS

14:08.280 --> 14:09.982
A BUNNY RULED ALL OF ENGLAND.

14:10.049 --> 14:10.950
WHEN?

14:11.016 --> 14:11.483
SEE?

14:11.550 --> 14:13.118
WELL, HOW DO I GET

14:13.185 --> 14:15.154
TO THIS WITCHES' COUNCIL?

14:15.221 --> 14:17.022
IT'S TEN MILLION
LIGHT-YEARS AWAY.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.625
BUT THERE'S A SHORTCUT
THROUGH OUR LINEN CLOSET.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.228
NOW, THE HEAD OF THE
COUNCIL IS NAMED DRELL.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.930
HE'S A MEAN, PIG-HEADED,
POWER-MAD DESPOT.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.098
WE USED TO DATE.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.067
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN CENTURIES.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.969
NOT SINCE HE LEFT HER
AT THE ALTAR.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.104
DADDY LOST A HUGE DEPOSIT
ON THE PARTHENON.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.305
WOULD YOU LET THAT GO?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.707
IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.

14:34.773 --> 14:38.344
I KNEW DRELL WAS BAD NEWS.
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
THAT BIG WEDDING...

14:38.410 --> 14:40.246
I'M TRYING TO TURN
BACK TIME HERE.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.247
CAN WE GO?

14:41.313 --> 14:42.214
OH, NO,
I COULDN'T.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.017
I SWORE I WOULD NEVER
TALK TO DRELL AGAIN

14:45.084 --> 14:45.985
AS LONG AS HE LIVED.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.887
BESIDES, THE COUNCIL
WILL RESPECT YOU MORE

14:48.954 --> 14:49.922
IF YOU GO ALONE.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.023
MAKE A LEFT
AT THE TOWELS

14:51.090 --> 14:52.191
AND FOLLOW THE SIGNS.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.459
AND WATCH OUT
FOR DRELL.

14:53.525 --> 14:54.460
AND WHATEVER YOU DO

14:54.526 --> 14:56.095
DON'T STARE AT HIS MOLE.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.102
OH... SORRY, IS THIS
THE WITCHES' COUNCIL?

15:03.168 --> 15:06.338
YES... DON'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

15:09.541 --> 15:13.112
DRELL, DID YOU REMEMBER
TO FEED THE CANDLE?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.582
THERE. HAPPY?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.917
UH, I KNOW I DON'T
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT

15:18.984 --> 15:21.987
BUT I, UM...
BROUGHT A WASHCLOTH.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.492
OKAY, UH, STATE YOUR NAME,
AGE AND REQUEST.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.527
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN
FIT YOU IN.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.096
I'M SABRINA, 16,
I'D LIKE TO TURN BACK TIME.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.065
DENIED!

15:33.132 --> 15:34.166
WELL, WE FIT YOU IN.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.501
NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.406
ARE YOU STARING AT MY MOLE?

15:40.472 --> 15:42.107
NO. I JUST DIDN'T GET A CHANCE

15:42.174 --> 15:44.243
TO EXPLAIN<i> WHY</i>
I WANTED TO TURN BACK TIME.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.577
LET'S HUMOR HER.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.246
OKAY... SPEAK!

15:47.313 --> 15:48.347
BUT QUICKLY.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.581
WHERE DO I START?

15:49.648 --> 15:52.084
FROM THE MOMENT
I STARTED MY NEW SCHOOL

15:52.151 --> 15:53.085
I DIDN'T FIT IN.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.987
I WORE THE
WRONG SHOES

15:55.054 --> 15:56.388
WHICH MAY SEEM
LIKE NOTHING

15:56.455 --> 15:58.590
BUT KIDS CAN BE SO JUDGMENTAL...

15:58.657 --> 15:59.858
I SAID QUICKLY.

15:59.925 --> 16:02.227
(<i> unnaturally fast</i> ):
LIBBY SPILLED
GRAPE SODA ON ME

16:02.294 --> 16:04.430
SO I TURNED HER
INTO A PINEAPPLE.

16:04.496 --> 16:07.266
SHE CAN TURN THE WHOLE SCHOOL
AGAINST ME

16:07.333 --> 16:08.334
AND LIFE IS HARD ENOUGH

16:08.400 --> 16:11.170
KNOWING YOU'RE A FREAK
WITHOUT EVERYONE ELSE KNOWING.

16:11.236 --> 16:15.074
OH, THE PROBLEMS OF TEENAGERS
ARE<i> SO</i> INTERESTING.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.241
WE'LL REVIEW YOUR CASE

16:16.308 --> 16:17.109
AND GET BACK TO YOU.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.143
BUT I NEED TO KNOW.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.678
AND YOU WILL!

16:19.745 --> 16:20.679
NOW GO! AND DON'T LET

16:20.746 --> 16:22.081
THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM

16:22.147 --> 16:23.215
HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT.

16:26.051 --> 16:28.120
YOU LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU, HUH, MOLEY?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.259
Sabrina:
<i>SALEM</i>

16:34.326 --> 16:36.662
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL
GRANT THE TIME REVERSAL?

16:36.729 --> 16:38.297
I'M THE WRONG
WITCH TO ASK.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.332
THEY WEREN'T VERY
LENIENT WITH<i> ME.</i>

16:40.399 --> 16:42.568
SENTENCED TO 100
YEARS AS A CAT...

16:42.634 --> 16:43.736
AND FOR WHAT?

16:43.802 --> 16:45.270
I DON'T KNOW. FOR WHAT?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.772
OH, LIKE ANY YOUNG KID

16:46.839 --> 16:48.774
I DREAMED OF
WORLD DOMINATION.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.009
'COURSE, THEY
REALLY CRACK DOWN

16:51.076 --> 16:52.277
WHEN YOU ACT UPON IT.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.314
WOW. NO WONDER YOU'RE
SO POSSESSIVE OF THE SOFA.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.516
MMM... IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN GLORIOUS.

16:57.583 --> 17:01.487
<i>ME</i> AS THE FIRM BUT JUST
EMPEROR OF EARTH.

17:01.553 --> 17:05.257
TRUST ME-- BEING A HOUSE
PET WASN'T EVEN PLAN "B."

17:05.324 --> 17:06.759
COME ON, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

17:06.825 --> 17:08.394
YOU TAKE 5,000 NAPS A DAY.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.595
I CAN'T GO DANCING.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.096
I CAN'T PLAY SQUASH.

17:11.163 --> 17:14.366
THE SOUND OF THE CAN
OPENER IS THE ONLY THING

17:14.433 --> 17:16.735
THAT MAKES ME
FEEL TRULY ALIVE.

17:16.802 --> 17:18.737
SALEM?

17:18.804 --> 17:21.273
WOULD YOU LIKE
YOUR RUBBER MOUSE?

17:21.340 --> 17:23.742
PLEASE.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.780
ANY WORD
FROM THE WITCHES' COUNCIL?

17:27.846 --> 17:30.182
NOT YET, AND IF I'M
GOING TO SCHOOL.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.683
I HAVE TO LEAVE
ANY SECOND.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.284
THAT'S IT.

17:32.351 --> 17:33.285
THAT'S IT?

17:33.352 --> 17:34.586
DON'T BURN
YOUR FINGERS.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.089
PLEASE-PLEASE-PLEASE...

17:37.156 --> 17:38.690
(<i> loud buzzer</i> )

17:38.757 --> 17:39.758
(<i> sighs</i> )

17:39.825 --> 17:41.627
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

17:41.693 --> 17:42.795
IT'S OKAY.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.196
SO, WHERE ARE WE MOVING?

17:44.263 --> 17:45.764
I HEAR GREENLAND'S A GROOVE.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.167
GET YOUR BOOKS--
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.334
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.436
I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.304
OH, YES, YOU ARE.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.207
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH LIFE
BEING AFRAID OF THINGS.

17:55.274 --> 17:56.375
TOUGHEN UP.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.110
BUT EVERYONE'LL LAUGH AT ME.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.278
TOUGHEN UP.

17:59.344 --> 18:00.245
SO THAT'S MY CHOICE?

18:00.312 --> 18:01.747
TOUGHEN UP OR TOUGHEN UP?

18:01.814 --> 18:03.482
AUNT ZELDA, WILL YOU HELP ME?

18:03.549 --> 18:05.384
OH, YOU KNOW I HATE TO SAY IT

18:05.451 --> 18:06.351
BUT AUNT HILDA'S RIGHT.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.354
I MEAN, WHO CARES WHAT
THE OTHER KIDS SAY?

18:10.289 --> 18:12.458
ACTUALLY...
LIBBY THOUGHT I WAS A FREAK

18:12.524 --> 18:14.193
EVEN BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.361
SEE?
SEE?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.464
FINE. I SURRENDER.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.701
I GUESS EVERY SCHOOL
NEEDS A WEIRD KID.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.503
MIGHT AS WELL BE ME.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.438
I WAS THE WEIRD KID.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.343
THEY DON'T TAR AND FEATHER
ANYMORE, DO THEY?

18:31.410 --> 18:32.511
I HATED THAT.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.513
YOU KNOW WHO'S
FAULT THIS IS?

18:34.580 --> 18:36.148
THAT JERK, DRELL'S.

18:37.216 --> 18:38.717
JUST A THOUGHT,
BUT I BET<i> YOU</i>

18:38.784 --> 18:40.719
COULD CONVINCE HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.187
ME?

18:42.254 --> 18:43.622
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.425
BESIDES, SABRINA'S
GOING TO BE FINE.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.361
YES, SHE'LL BE
OSTRACIZED AND REVILED

18:49.428 --> 18:51.463
BUT... SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.831
THE WOUNDS WILL HEAL.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.800
THE SCARS WILL FADE.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.802
YOU KNOW I CAN'T FACE DRELL!

18:57.903 --> 18:59.872
TOUGHEN UP.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.841
IT'S PAYBACK TIME, DRELL.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.743
I'M COMING IN!

19:09.314 --> 19:11.350
Drell:
<i>HILDA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?</i>

19:11.416 --> 19:13.352
<i>GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY MOLE!</i>

19:14.820 --> 19:16.421
HEY... I GOT A JOKE.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.456
KNOCK-KNOCK.

19:17.523 --> 19:18.490
WHO'S THERE?

19:18.557 --> 19:19.658
BRAD.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.894
BRAD PITT? YOU TOLD
ME THAT YESTERDAY.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.895
NO, I DIDN'T.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.696
I JUST HEARD
IT ON THE BUS.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.400
REALLY?

19:28.467 --> 19:31.436
EXCELLENT WORK, SABRINA.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.439
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU
ACED THE POP QUIZ.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.441
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I JUST LOVE HISTORY.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.442
Man:
HEADS UP!

19:37.509 --> 19:39.545
ALL RIGHT!
NICE CATCH.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.580
(<i> applause</i> )

19:44.416 --> 19:44.917
CAN I SIT HERE?

19:44.983 --> 19:45.817
SURE.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.719
THAT WAS A GREAT CATCH.

19:47.786 --> 19:48.954
I WAS IN THE ZONE.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.489
DO YOU KNOW JENNY?

19:50.556 --> 19:52.624
YOU LIVE IN THE HOUSE
WITH THE FUNNY MAILBOX.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.959
BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT--

19:54.026 --> 19:56.361
SATURDAY NIGHT, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SEE A MOVIE

19:56.428 --> 19:57.362
WITH JENNY AND ME?

19:57.429 --> 19:59.431
SURE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

19:59.498 --> 20:00.499
COOL.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.867
COOL.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.936
SO, YOU WERE SAYING
ABOUT MAILBOXES?

20:04.002 --> 20:04.770

20:04.836 --> 20:06.805

20:06.872 --> 20:08.240

20:08.307 --> 20:10.342

20:11.476 --> 20:12.377

20:12.444 --> 20:15.547

EVERYONE COOL TO COME.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.585
(<i> screams</i> )

20:26.758 --> 20:27.993
I LOVE BEING A WITCH!

20:28.060 --> 20:30.896
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE
THE COUNCIL CHANGE THEIR MINDS

20:30.963 --> 20:33.265
BUT I GOT TO DO

20:33.332 --> 20:35.000

20:35.067 --> 20:36.501

20:44.509 --> 20:45.510

20:50.549 --> 20:52.384

20:52.451 --> 20:53.885
BUT HOW ABOUT A DANCE?

21:04.730 --> 21:08.367

21:08.433 --> 21:11.036
