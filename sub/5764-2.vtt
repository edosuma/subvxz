00:01.233 --> 00:02.433
<i>previously on
ghost whisperer...</i>

00:02.501 --> 00:03.901
I feel like i've waited
my whole life

00:03.969 --> 00:09.106
Just to meet you.

00:09.174 --> 00:11.976
Is this what our lives
have become?
one giant party?

00:12.043 --> 00:13.310
Both: yes!
[laughter]

00:13.378 --> 00:15.246
Ooh, dad's gonna get us!
he's gonna get us!

00:15.313 --> 00:16.981
Eli: but you feel it,
too, right?

00:17.048 --> 00:18.382
Every time i treat
a patient here,

00:18.450 --> 00:19.583
As soon as i walk
in the building...

00:19.651 --> 00:20.918
Lost souls,
you know?

00:20.986 --> 00:22.286
But it's a hospital.

00:22.354 --> 00:23.454
People die here.

00:23.522 --> 00:25.122
No, i worked
in a lot of hospitals.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.291
There's something different
about this one.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.293
[electricity flickering]

00:32.330 --> 00:33.397
Melinda...

00:33.465 --> 00:34.798
Melinda: where are they?

00:34.866 --> 00:36.367
Are they in danger?
aiden isn't,

00:36.434 --> 00:37.501
If he stays where he is.

00:37.569 --> 00:39.503
Aiden...

00:39.571 --> 00:42.439
Just stay where you are.

00:42.507 --> 00:44.808
Come here!
you're not safe there.

00:44.876 --> 00:46.410
How do you know?
i just know.

00:49.514 --> 00:50.648
Are you ok?
yeah.

00:50.715 --> 00:52.850
I made tyler stay with me,
like i was supposed to.

00:52.918 --> 00:54.218
Who told you that
you were supposed to?

00:54.286 --> 00:55.719
I don't know.
the visions i've had,

00:55.787 --> 00:58.389
They've been from aiden?
is he a sensitive?

00:58.456 --> 01:01.392
The word you're looking for
is "empath."

01:01.459 --> 01:03.861
He can share
other people's feelings.

01:03.929 --> 01:05.996
You don't
want him to know
he's connected to you?

01:06.064 --> 01:08.299
No. if he did,
then he'd know
that his dreams

01:08.366 --> 01:09.500
Aren't really his.

01:09.568 --> 01:11.335
I want his dreams
to belong to him

01:11.403 --> 01:13.103
Like any little boy.

01:13.171 --> 01:15.172
[crickets chirping]

01:16.174 --> 01:17.608
Melinda: ok.

01:17.676 --> 01:20.544
Time for you
to get comfy
all on your own.

01:20.612 --> 01:22.279
Tomorrow, we're
gonna get up early

01:22.347 --> 01:25.416
And we're going
to have your
favorite breakfast.

01:25.483 --> 01:27.585
But for right now,

01:27.652 --> 01:30.221
Here's
your monkey, ok?

01:30.288 --> 01:33.624
Good night, baby.
sweet dreams.

01:33.692 --> 01:35.292
Here, put your arms
in there.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.894
There you go.

01:36.962 --> 01:39.096
But i don't want
to go to sleep yet.

01:39.164 --> 01:40.631
I'm not tired.

01:40.699 --> 01:43.133
Well, you're just
gonna have to give it
your best shot, ok?

01:43.201 --> 01:46.470
But i--i'm thirsty.

01:46.538 --> 01:48.205
Uh-uh, don't try to
pull that with me.

01:48.273 --> 01:50.107
Good night.

01:50.175 --> 01:51.842
I'll get the light.

01:55.547 --> 01:57.781
It's not even 8:00.
do you really think
he's gonna go down?

01:57.849 --> 02:00.384
Unheard of, right?

02:00.452 --> 02:02.453
[groans]

02:09.661 --> 02:11.895
Jim: wow.

02:11.963 --> 02:13.230
He's an angel.

02:13.298 --> 02:15.232
Hard to imagine
he's the same little guy

02:15.300 --> 02:17.801
Who just smeared
peanut butter
on my laptop.

02:19.204 --> 02:21.338
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

02:21.406 --> 02:23.207
You know what this
means, don't you?

02:23.275 --> 02:24.742
We get a gold star?

02:24.809 --> 02:28.912
No, we might
actually have some
time...to ourselves.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.181
Uh, if i didn't have
peanut butter on my laptop.

02:31.249 --> 02:32.950
No, laptop's
peanut butter-free.

02:33.018 --> 02:34.652
I had a minute when
you were brushing
aiden's teeth.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.220
Wait a minute,
if we just get
the dishes done--

02:36.288 --> 02:38.122
Done! i did them while
you were reading to aiden.

02:38.189 --> 02:39.523
Well, if we can get
the laundry folded--

02:39.591 --> 02:41.225
Also done. clean scrubs,
in your drawer.

02:41.293 --> 02:42.293
I took out the trash.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.927
I made aiden's lunch
for tomorrow.

02:43.995 --> 02:45.462
You did?
yeah.

02:45.530 --> 02:47.131
Ah, that is such a turn-on.

02:47.198 --> 02:48.932
If you did not have
to go to work tonight...

02:49.000 --> 02:50.434
I don't.

02:50.502 --> 02:52.803
I got that
intern scott
to cover my shift.

02:54.205 --> 02:56.674
We have a totally free night?

02:56.741 --> 02:59.576
Absolutely.

02:59.644 --> 03:01.779
Oh!

03:01.846 --> 03:03.647
Come here.

03:07.886 --> 03:08.919
Oh!

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:21.766 --> 03:23.734
So, where's
your roommate?

03:23.802 --> 03:26.236
Uh, cramming
for a psych midterm.

03:26.304 --> 03:28.439
Won't be back for a while.

03:28.506 --> 03:29.940
[both moaning]

03:30.008 --> 03:31.709
Lucky us.

03:37.549 --> 03:39.950
You know, just in case...

03:43.321 --> 03:47.458
Don't move a muscle.

03:47.525 --> 03:48.692
Oh.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.627
Don't move a muscle.

[gasping]

03:59.838 --> 04:00.938
Oh, no!

04:01.005 --> 04:01.939
What kind of--what?!

04:02.006 --> 04:04.041
[gasping]

04:07.645 --> 04:09.980
What kind of person
would do this?

04:10.048 --> 04:11.448
I don't know!

04:11.516 --> 04:13.517
[cracking]

04:15.253 --> 04:17.788
What's happening?

04:17.856 --> 04:19.822
[gasping]

04:25.663 --> 04:27.931
Oh, no!

04:27.999 --> 04:30.000
[gasping]

04:31.736 --> 04:34.571
Maybe it wasn't
a person at all.

04:49.721 --> 04:51.722
[indistinct whispering]

04:57.128 --> 04:59.029
[gasps]

04:59.097 --> 05:00.464
It must be done.

05:00.532 --> 05:02.733
Who are you?

05:02.801 --> 05:05.102
Stop it before it spreads.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.603
Stop what?

05:06.671 --> 05:09.840
If it's not
too late already.

05:14.712 --> 05:15.979
Shush, now.

05:16.047 --> 05:17.948
Shush, girl.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.543
Your screams
won't help you.

05:20.544 --> 05:22.544
Whose screams?
Who are you talking to?

05:22.954 --> 05:25.622
[gasping]
this will hurt,

05:25.690 --> 05:27.257
But it'll be over
quickly.

05:29.258 --> 05:30.258
What are you doing?

05:33.259 --> 05:34.259
***

05:35.800 --> 05:38.235
Hold still now.
melinda: no!

05:39.270 --> 05:41.271
[screaming]

05:44.942 --> 05:47.210
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

06:04.862 --> 06:07.864
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

06:19.058 --> 06:21.860
Jim: so with the robes
and the hushed voices,

06:21.928 --> 06:23.929
I mean, is there any chance
they could have been doctors

06:23.996 --> 06:25.764
Performing, i don't know,
some kind of operation?

06:25.832 --> 06:27.532
With a huge, rusty needle?

06:27.600 --> 06:29.201
Well, you said it looked
like they came from
another era.

06:29.268 --> 06:31.036
Maybe it was the era
before sterilization.

06:31.104 --> 06:32.370
Yeah, or no anesthesia.

06:32.438 --> 06:34.005
They just kept saying,
"hold still,"

06:34.073 --> 06:36.241
But i could still
feel everything.

06:36.309 --> 06:38.743
And they couldn't see
or hear you at all.

06:38.811 --> 06:40.378
You know, it sounds
like one of your visions

06:40.446 --> 06:41.713
You've been channeling
from aiden.

06:41.781 --> 06:43.815
Yeah, he was awake
when i went in
to check on him.

06:43.883 --> 06:45.984
Hey, there weren't
any little needles

06:46.052 --> 06:47.819
In any of his
dreams?

06:47.887 --> 06:49.988
No, he doesn't remember
his ghost dreams.

06:50.056 --> 06:53.458
Thank god. you know,
he certainly remembers
his other dreams.

06:53.526 --> 06:55.293
You know, a couple
nights ago he was dreaming

06:55.361 --> 06:57.629
That he was flying over
a mountain made of ice cream.

06:57.697 --> 06:59.531
Now he wants to
learn how to skate--
mommy?

06:59.599 --> 07:01.867
Dad!
aha! whoo!

07:01.934 --> 07:03.468
Hey, do you want
o.j. or milk
with your pancakes?

07:03.536 --> 07:05.637
Milk, please.
you got it.

07:05.705 --> 07:07.305
Hey, i think
we got spongebob

07:07.373 --> 07:09.241
Coming to visit us
for breakfast.

07:09.308 --> 07:10.809
Ahh, nice socks.

07:10.877 --> 07:12.844
Jim...

07:12.912 --> 07:14.412
I couldn't decide.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.248
You know what,
i think it's great,

07:16.315 --> 07:18.350
And i am very impressed
with how you're getting
yourself ready.

07:18.417 --> 07:19.818
Thanks!

07:19.886 --> 07:21.520
You're welcome.

07:21.587 --> 07:24.122
So, is ned ok?

07:24.190 --> 07:25.790
Ned? why wouldn't he be?

07:25.858 --> 07:28.193
He called before.
didn't he?

07:30.696 --> 07:32.564
Well, someone called.

07:32.632 --> 07:34.766
I just didn't get
the chance to check it.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.335
I think ned
wants to talk to you.

07:39.705 --> 07:43.141
Yeah, i-i think
you could be
right about that.

07:43.209 --> 07:44.976
Um, your dad's going
to get the syrup.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.881
[phone beeping]

07:51.384 --> 07:54.719
Woman: please
enter your password,
then press pound...

07:54.787 --> 07:57.155
Does this have
something to do
with your vision?

07:57.223 --> 07:58.823
Because as
the only member
of this family

07:58.891 --> 08:00.158
Who doesn't
traffic in ghosts,

08:00.226 --> 08:01.493
I'm kind of
at a loss.

08:01.561 --> 08:03.862
Well, all i know is,
i have a voicemail from ned.

08:03.930 --> 08:05.730
It came in this morning,
my phone was on vibrate.

08:05.798 --> 08:08.166
There is no way that aiden
would have known he called.

08:09.268 --> 08:10.702
But he did.

08:10.770 --> 08:12.337
What does this mean?

08:12.405 --> 08:15.707
That he's going
to continue to amaze us.

08:15.775 --> 08:17.342
And that whatever
has meaning to me

08:17.410 --> 08:19.544
Obviously means
something to him, too.

08:19.612 --> 08:22.981
Yeah, and ned means
a lot to both of you.

08:23.049 --> 08:24.316
Ned: hey, melinda.
it's ned.

08:24.383 --> 08:27.285
Something weird
happened at school.

08:27.353 --> 08:28.853
A friend of mine's
in trouble.

08:28.921 --> 08:31.189
What happened?

08:31.257 --> 08:32.691
Can you come over?

08:33.960 --> 08:35.493
[exhales]

08:35.561 --> 08:38.063
[indistinct chatter]

08:39.599 --> 08:41.499
It was like this
when we came in,

08:41.567 --> 08:43.168
Only it was wet.

08:43.236 --> 08:44.202
It's nail polish.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.004
Melinda: yeah,
i can smell it.

08:46.072 --> 08:49.174
Look, i guess
someone could have
walked in here

08:49.242 --> 08:53.545
And hung my doll
and painted the walls

08:53.613 --> 08:56.214
In nail polish to make it
look like blood,

08:56.282 --> 09:00.418
But we were right here
when that mirror shattered.

09:00.486 --> 09:02.387
What caused that?

09:02.455 --> 09:04.422
Did you call
the campus cops?

09:04.490 --> 09:06.224
No, we called you.

09:06.292 --> 09:10.428
A friend of brianna's
died a few days ago...

09:10.496 --> 09:12.063
A friend
who was angry at her.

09:13.366 --> 09:15.767
Ned told me
what you can do.

09:15.835 --> 09:18.637
So...

09:18.704 --> 09:20.939
Is there one,

09:21.007 --> 09:23.408
Here?
no.

09:23.476 --> 09:26.244
No ghost.

09:26.312 --> 09:29.414
So, why don't you
tell me about
your friend who died.

09:32.018 --> 09:33.618
Gwen.

09:33.686 --> 09:36.955
We used
to be really tight.

09:37.023 --> 09:40.258
She was run down
by a car about a week ago.

09:53.939 --> 09:56.474
By then, we weren't
really speaking.

09:56.542 --> 09:57.509
What happened?

09:57.576 --> 09:59.144
I saw her at a party.

09:59.211 --> 10:01.279
She was making out
with a guy.

10:01.347 --> 10:03.415
She had a boyfriend

10:03.482 --> 10:06.951
Who was a good friend
of mine, too.

10:07.019 --> 10:10.922
It ticked me off,
so i told a friend

10:10.990 --> 10:12.023
Who told a friend--

10:12.091 --> 10:13.625
Who told her boyfriend.

10:13.693 --> 10:15.327
Gwen was really upset.

10:15.394 --> 10:17.529
Upset enough
to do all this?

10:17.596 --> 10:21.199
Actually, there's
one more thing.

10:21.267 --> 10:24.502
Can a ghost send an email?

10:25.938 --> 10:27.872
"hello, my name
is sally stitch.

10:27.940 --> 10:29.774
"i have chosen you.
forward this,

10:29.842 --> 10:31.943
"or you or someone
you love will suffer.

10:32.011 --> 10:34.546
Do not break the chain,
or the suffering
will have no end."

10:34.613 --> 10:36.514
Wow. that's
pretty disturbing.

10:36.582 --> 10:38.183
This gwen's email?

10:38.250 --> 10:39.851
Yep.

10:39.919 --> 10:41.353
I got it a few days ago.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.054
I didn't forward it.

10:43.122 --> 10:44.956
Guess that made her mad.

10:45.024 --> 10:46.725
And it came
after gwen died?

10:46.792 --> 10:49.060
Two days after,
according to the timestamp.

10:49.128 --> 10:51.496
So the image of
this girl with her
eyes stitched shut,

10:51.564 --> 10:53.498
Would that
mean anything
to you and gwen?

10:53.566 --> 10:55.233
No.
so it could be

10:55.301 --> 10:57.168
Some chain email
gwen got
and forwarded.

10:57.236 --> 10:59.671
Except that's not
all she did.

10:59.739 --> 11:02.374
She's the only one
who could have known.

11:02.441 --> 11:04.576
Known what?
look at this.

11:04.643 --> 11:06.878
At the end of the email,
there are these descriptions

11:06.946 --> 11:09.547
Of what happened to people
who broke the chain.

11:11.217 --> 11:12.917
"a college student
ignored the email

11:12.985 --> 11:14.486
"and found
her best friend luanne

11:14.553 --> 11:17.555
Hanging from a noose in
a blood-splattered closet."

11:17.623 --> 11:19.324
Like your doll.

11:19.392 --> 11:22.227
Luanne is my doll.

11:22.294 --> 11:25.196
She's a keepsake i've had
since i was six.

11:25.264 --> 11:28.133
Gwen is the only one
who knew she what
she meant to me.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.635
She's the only one
who even knew her name.

11:33.072 --> 11:35.173
[birds chirping]

11:35.241 --> 11:37.675
Eli: ghosts are creating
their own emails now?

11:37.743 --> 11:39.177
Aren't they
getting crafty.

11:39.245 --> 11:41.079
What's next,
blogging? webisodes?

11:41.147 --> 11:43.515
Well, it's possible gwen
didn't create the email.

11:43.582 --> 11:44.450
It's just something
going around--

11:44.518 --> 11:46.786
A scary image
she's using to
terrorize her friends.

11:46.853 --> 11:48.320
Ex-friend.

11:48.388 --> 11:51.123
Ok, so what would this
email have to do with
two friends fighting?

11:51.191 --> 11:53.426
Maybe it's a way for gwen
to pay brianna back.

11:53.493 --> 11:54.727
For not forwarding it?

11:54.795 --> 11:56.562
For getting her in trouble
with her boyfriend.

11:56.630 --> 11:57.963
I did a little research
on the image

11:58.031 --> 11:59.899
Of someone with
their eyes sewn shut.

11:59.966 --> 12:01.434
Ugh, i hate needles.

12:01.501 --> 12:02.935
It's rooted
in some lore.

12:03.003 --> 12:04.336
You said the people
in your vision,

12:04.404 --> 12:05.738
They didn't seem to be
of this time, right?

12:05.806 --> 12:07.273
Right.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.275
<i>well, in dante's inferno,
it was punishment for envy.</i>

12:09.342 --> 12:11.911
In scottish folklore,
it was punishment
for intimate betrayal.

12:11.978 --> 12:13.913
But i could
only find one society

12:13.980 --> 12:15.881
That actually
put it into practice.

12:15.949 --> 12:17.183
The puritans?

12:17.250 --> 12:19.418
"a zealous offshoot
deems stitching of eyes

12:19.486 --> 12:22.121
Suitable punishment
for those who spread
slanderous gossip."

12:22.189 --> 12:23.556
That look like
anything you saw?

12:23.623 --> 12:25.357
It's hard to tell,
but the clothes are similar.

12:25.425 --> 12:26.592
And so is the theme.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.260
Gwen was hurt by gossip.
yeah,

12:28.328 --> 12:29.695
By one friend,
but this email,

12:29.763 --> 12:31.130
It's designed
to be forwarded.

12:31.198 --> 12:32.598
I mean, gwen punished
brianna when she didn't
pass it on,

12:32.666 --> 12:33.899
So what does she want?

12:33.967 --> 12:35.201
Spread a little fear
on her way out--

12:35.268 --> 12:36.769
Make her mark,
so to speak.

12:36.837 --> 12:38.337
Do we know if the email
was sent to anyone else?

12:38.405 --> 12:39.905
It was a blind c.c.

12:39.973 --> 12:42.074
You wouldn't do that
unless there were
other recipients.

12:42.142 --> 12:44.777
So, this is only
the beginning.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.685
Oh, sick!

12:52.752 --> 12:54.854
Dude, check this out.

12:58.325 --> 13:00.259
Oh, man.

13:00.327 --> 13:02.628
It says
you're supposed
to forward it.

13:02.696 --> 13:05.831
[scoffs] yeah.
i'm not forwarding
this to anyone i know.

13:05.899 --> 13:07.700
You sure?

13:09.369 --> 13:12.471
What's it say
down there?

13:12.539 --> 13:14.974
Crap that supposedly happens
to people who didn't.

13:15.041 --> 13:17.543
This guy found his dog
dead in a car.

13:17.611 --> 13:20.212
This girl's father
bled out in the bathtub.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.981
Intense.

13:22.048 --> 13:24.550
What if it's true?

13:24.618 --> 13:26.218
Come on, dude.
it's a bunch of lies.

13:26.286 --> 13:28.787
You sure, man?
i mean, look at this.

13:28.855 --> 13:31.824
A girl, luanne,

13:31.892 --> 13:34.426
Was found hanging
in a blood-splattered
dorm room.

13:34.494 --> 13:35.928
[chuckles]

13:35.996 --> 13:38.464
I'd toss it off
to somebody
just to be safe.

13:41.835 --> 13:43.369
You did toss it off
to someone.

13:43.436 --> 13:44.937
You tossed it off to me.

13:45.005 --> 13:48.307
Hey. it said i could die.
i'm not taking any chances.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.676
Whooo!

13:50.744 --> 13:53.045
[chuckles]

13:53.113 --> 13:54.914
Whatever.

13:54.981 --> 13:57.082
It's your funeral.

14:02.483 --> 14:03.483
See you, Sally.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.366
This is really
beautiful.

15:04.434 --> 15:06.201
We should do this
more often.
i know.

15:06.269 --> 15:08.504
Fast food never tastes better
than when it's in the great
outdoors, honey.

15:08.571 --> 15:10.339
Now that they've got
the whole square

15:10.407 --> 15:11.874
Wired for wi-fi.

15:11.941 --> 15:13.075
I'm sorry.

15:13.143 --> 15:14.576
You were
ten minutes late

15:14.644 --> 15:16.011
And i've been
working
all morning,

15:16.079 --> 15:17.713
And so i just
thought i'd look
at gwen's obit.

15:19.482 --> 15:21.784
What'd you find out?
not much, actually.

15:21.851 --> 15:23.585
I mean, she was
raised by her mom,

15:23.653 --> 15:25.220
Only child,
really good student,

15:25.288 --> 15:26.455
Did a lot
of charity work.

15:26.523 --> 15:28.357
I have ten minutes
with you,

15:28.425 --> 15:30.292
And i am talking
about my ghost.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.528
Come on, i get you alone
twice in one week.

15:32.595 --> 15:34.897
I'm a spoiled man.

15:34.964 --> 15:37.232
Come here.

15:38.301 --> 15:40.736
Oh! there you are.

15:43.006 --> 15:45.974
Man, you two
are hard to find.

15:46.042 --> 15:47.309
Do you know that
your cell's off?

15:47.377 --> 15:49.244
Yeah. i turned it off.

15:49.312 --> 15:51.580
Ok. no reason
to get snippy.

15:51.648 --> 15:53.382
I just thought i'd
let you know that

15:53.450 --> 15:55.050
Someone sent me
the sally stitch chain.

15:55.118 --> 15:56.919
Who sent it to you?
a student of mine.

15:56.986 --> 15:58.854
It's spreading across
campus like kudzu weed.

15:58.922 --> 16:00.055
Somebody you flunked?

16:00.123 --> 16:01.924
No. i asked him
to send it to me.

16:01.991 --> 16:04.093
He fractured his ankle
walking into class.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.594
He thought
it was because
he broke the chain.

16:05.662 --> 16:07.629
I told him to send it
to me so he would
stop freaking out.

16:07.697 --> 16:09.164
I was right, wasn't i?

16:10.266 --> 16:11.967
No chance
emails are cursed.

16:14.371 --> 16:16.605
I'd hate to be proof
that curses exist.

16:16.673 --> 16:19.541
Oh, please.
there's always
an explanation.

16:19.609 --> 16:22.411
Yeah, i knew that.

16:22.479 --> 16:24.246
Then try explaining this.

16:26.483 --> 16:28.150
Wait.

16:28.218 --> 16:30.285
All these things happened
to people who broke the chain?

16:30.353 --> 16:32.321
Apparently, the chain
keeps breaking.

16:35.392 --> 16:37.192
Yeah, but why would
gwen want to cause
all this suffering?

16:37.260 --> 16:38.861
I mean, why would
she be so angry?

16:38.928 --> 16:40.529
She said that
her death was
an accident, right?

16:43.233 --> 16:44.700
Wait a minute.

16:47.103 --> 16:49.605
Brianna said
that gwen got hit
by a car.

16:49.672 --> 16:52.341
Well, i always
assumed that it was
as a pedestrian.

16:52.409 --> 16:53.675
But she was
a passenger.

16:53.743 --> 16:55.010
Passenger in what?

16:55.078 --> 16:57.045
In a car that got
into an accident.

16:57.113 --> 16:58.847
Look, it says
that there's
two victims.

16:58.915 --> 17:00.416
Now, what did
the email say again?

17:00.483 --> 17:02.551
"my name is sally stitch,
i'm a nasty little bi--"

17:02.619 --> 17:04.553
The threat.

17:05.622 --> 17:08.257
It said that
something bad
would happen

17:08.324 --> 17:11.160
To you or someone
you love.

17:11.227 --> 17:14.530
What if it
happened to both?

17:18.233 --> 17:20.301
[monitor beeping]

17:22.638 --> 17:25.907
Woman on p.a.:
dr. forest, dial 102, please.

17:28.478 --> 17:30.479
That's gwen's mom.

17:30.547 --> 17:34.183
She ran a red light
straight into a guy
taking a left.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.051
What happened
to him?

17:36.119 --> 17:38.053
Minor injuries, he's fine.

17:38.121 --> 17:40.355
I don't understand.
what happened to gwen?

17:40.423 --> 17:42.357
She must have gotten
out of the car to go
get help for her mother.

17:42.425 --> 17:45.694
She got out straight
into the path
of an oncoming car.

17:45.762 --> 17:47.262
D.o.a.

17:47.330 --> 17:49.131
What about her mother?

17:49.199 --> 17:50.999
Been in a coma ever since.

17:58.074 --> 17:59.208
She's here.

18:06.082 --> 18:07.416
Gwen?

18:08.985 --> 18:11.253
You can see me?

18:11.321 --> 18:12.488
It's ok.

18:12.555 --> 18:14.857
I can help you. i...

18:17.160 --> 18:19.194
I think i understand
what happened.

18:19.262 --> 18:21.230
Everyone thinks
it was an accident.

18:21.297 --> 18:22.397
But you don't.

18:22.465 --> 18:25.267
You think it was
the email.

18:25.335 --> 18:27.069
[monitor beeping]

18:27.136 --> 18:29.271
You got it right
before the accident,

18:29.339 --> 18:30.606
And you didn't
forward it.

18:30.673 --> 18:32.941
Not then.

18:34.310 --> 18:37.412
My mom lives
a few hours away.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.148
I was so happy to see her.

18:40.216 --> 18:42.618
Ah, i wish
i lived closer.

18:42.685 --> 18:44.586
We could go to
lento's every night.

18:44.654 --> 18:45.854
[laughs] right.

18:45.922 --> 18:47.122
I'd be a blimp.

18:47.190 --> 18:49.057
[both laugh]

18:51.094 --> 18:53.228
The minute i opened
the email, i wished i hadn't.

18:53.296 --> 18:56.031
I hate those chain things,
you want to just trash them,

18:56.099 --> 18:58.600
But then,
part of you wonders...

18:59.802 --> 19:02.237
What if there's
something to it?

19:05.742 --> 19:08.477
I made the wrong choice.

19:08.478 --> 19:09.478
Because right after, I hit ****

19:16.653 --> 19:19.054
[alarm sounding]

19:21.724 --> 19:23.392
Mom?

19:23.459 --> 19:25.827
Mom, are you ok?
wake up, mom!

19:25.895 --> 19:28.564
Don't do this,
please!

19:28.631 --> 19:30.065
[horn honking]

19:30.133 --> 19:32.301
[brakes squealing]

19:35.138 --> 19:37.039
So, you think
because of what you did

19:37.106 --> 19:39.441
With the email,
that caused the accident.

19:39.509 --> 19:41.109
I'm dead, aren't i?

19:41.177 --> 19:43.912
[monitor beeping]

19:43.980 --> 19:47.983
But it's not fair
that she has to suffer
for what i did.

19:48.051 --> 19:50.986
But that's the rule,
of the email.

19:51.054 --> 19:52.754
"forward this,

19:52.822 --> 19:55.958
"or you or someone
you love will suffer.

19:56.025 --> 19:58.327
"if you break the chain,

19:58.394 --> 20:01.930
The suffering
will have no end."

20:01.998 --> 20:04.566
I have to save her.

20:04.634 --> 20:06.268
It's not too late.

20:06.336 --> 20:08.770
So, you think if you keep
the email going,

20:08.838 --> 20:10.872
That she'll be spared.
yes.

20:12.475 --> 20:14.543
And i'm sorry
brianna got it,

20:14.611 --> 20:17.512
But i had no choice.
and neither does she.

20:17.580 --> 20:20.382
She has to keep
the chain going.

20:20.450 --> 20:22.618
They all do.

20:22.685 --> 20:24.486
So, wait a minute.

20:24.554 --> 20:28.890
All the horrible things
that have been happening
to people in the email...

20:28.958 --> 20:30.359
Are you haunting them?

20:30.426 --> 20:32.394
I didn't start this.
someone sent it to me.

20:32.462 --> 20:34.363
Yeah, but you're the one
who has to make it stop.

20:34.430 --> 20:35.530
You don't understand!

20:35.598 --> 20:37.666
Something scared you.

20:37.734 --> 20:39.901
Was it the same thing
that scared me?

20:41.537 --> 20:43.138
I had a vision

20:43.206 --> 20:46.375
That my eyes were
being sewn shut,
like sally stitch.

20:48.878 --> 20:50.679
Did you see it, too?

20:50.747 --> 20:52.514
Please.

20:52.582 --> 20:55.517
Just don't try
and stop this.

20:55.585 --> 20:57.653
What's it going
to take?

20:57.720 --> 21:00.589
How much fear
needs to be spread?

21:00.657 --> 21:02.557
I don't know.

21:03.926 --> 21:05.260
But it is not
my fault

21:05.328 --> 21:06.695
If people get hurt.

21:06.763 --> 21:09.097
It's yours.

21:19.809 --> 21:21.810
[indistinct chatter]

21:42.098 --> 21:44.032
Gwen?

21:44.100 --> 21:45.367
You want me
to send this,

21:45.435 --> 21:48.103
Give you an excuse to
keep terrorizing people?

21:49.439 --> 21:51.473
Yeah, well, forget it.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.141
No deal.

22:01.284 --> 22:03.351
No.

22:05.555 --> 22:07.756
[line ringing]

22:07.824 --> 22:11.226
?and i'm about
to let you go ?

22:11.294 --> 22:12.994
?and i'm about
to save the day ?

22:13.062 --> 22:14.996
Whoo!
[phone vibrating]

22:15.064 --> 22:18.433
?and i'm about to let it
all hang out ?

22:18.501 --> 22:19.735
[line ringing]
come on, mom.

22:19.802 --> 22:21.136
Pick up.

?i didn't want
to give you up ?

?didn't want to let me in ?
[phone vibrating]

22:33.716 --> 22:37.552
?well, i guess
it didn't hurt me enough ?

?when you wondered
where i'd been ?

22:40.289 --> 22:41.289
Oh, hey, honey.

22:41.357 --> 22:42.457
I thought
you were studying.

22:42.525 --> 22:43.458
Ned: mom!

22:43.526 --> 22:45.026
Are you ok?
yeah, yeah.

22:45.094 --> 22:46.495
I was just rocking out
to your friend nick's band.

22:46.562 --> 22:48.330
You know,
they're really good.

22:48.397 --> 22:50.031
Why, is there
something wrong?

22:50.099 --> 22:52.968
Nothing. nothing.
i've been trying
to call you.

22:53.035 --> 22:55.103
Oh, honey, i had
my phone on vibrate...

22:55.171 --> 22:57.639
And the music was really loud.

22:57.707 --> 22:59.741
[gasps] oh, my god!

22:59.809 --> 23:01.276
Mom!

23:01.344 --> 23:02.811
Mom!

23:10.419 --> 23:11.753
[thud]

23:15.024 --> 23:17.025
[indistinct chatter]

23:20.029 --> 23:21.696
[sighs] i'm sorry.

23:21.764 --> 23:23.965
Is he ok?

23:42.361 --> 23:44.462
Woman on p.a.:
dr. curry, please check
with the message center.

23:44.529 --> 23:46.364
Dr. demoran to recovery.

23:46.431 --> 23:48.432
[indistinct chatter]

23:49.668 --> 23:51.569
Hey. is ned going to be ok?

23:51.637 --> 23:53.104
Yeah, he's got
a scratched cornea,

23:53.171 --> 23:55.273
But he'll be
all right. there's no
permanent damage.

23:55.340 --> 23:56.841
And delia?

23:56.909 --> 23:58.276
Just first-degree
burns on her hands.

23:58.343 --> 23:59.410
They'll heal
in a week.

23:59.478 --> 24:00.912
I mean,
they were both lucky.

24:00.979 --> 24:02.580
The ghost said
that when someone gets hurt,

24:02.648 --> 24:04.982
It's going to be my fault.
i guess this is what she meant.

24:05.050 --> 24:06.550
Does she really believe
her mom's going to die

24:06.618 --> 24:07.785
If we break this chain?

24:07.853 --> 24:10.521
I've been checking
that email i got.

24:10.589 --> 24:12.356
Let me tell you,
that list of tragedies
keeps growing.

24:12.424 --> 24:13.791
Bodies are piling up.

24:13.859 --> 24:15.459
Everybody in the e.r.
keeps talking about it.

24:15.527 --> 24:18.162
They're blaming it on
household accidents,
twisted ankles.

24:18.163 --> 24:19.163
***

24:19.831 --> 24:21.666
Which would have
happened whether

24:21.733 --> 24:23.067
They got the email
or not.

24:23.135 --> 24:24.368
Yeah.

24:24.436 --> 24:27.004
Sally stitch.

24:27.072 --> 24:30.074
We have to prove
that she and that email
are not real.

24:30.142 --> 24:32.710
Any chance
you could figure out
who created it?

24:32.778 --> 24:33.978
[scoffs]
fat chance.

24:34.046 --> 24:35.746
Yeah.
i mean, that thing

24:35.814 --> 24:38.082
Could have been
going around for months
before gwen even got it.

24:38.150 --> 24:39.917
Yeah, the email's building.
i mean, every time
somebody gets hurt,

24:39.985 --> 24:41.519
It just makes gwen's case.

24:41.586 --> 24:43.054
What are you
going to do,

24:43.121 --> 24:45.022
Travel the speed of
d.s.l. to prove each
one was an accident?

24:45.090 --> 24:48.826
No. just the one
who turned her into
a believer and a ghost.

24:48.894 --> 24:51.162
Wait, gwen's obit
says she died
in a car accident.

24:51.229 --> 24:54.031
But we know that she was
disoriented from
the other accident,

24:54.099 --> 24:55.866
Two car accident.

24:55.934 --> 24:57.668
There was a witness.

24:57.736 --> 24:58.769
The other driver.

24:58.837 --> 25:01.105
Can you get your hands
on a police report?

25:06.144 --> 25:08.579
Thank you.

25:08.647 --> 25:10.815
I really appreciate you
taking the time to talk.

25:10.882 --> 25:12.516
Well, i was due
a break, anyways.

25:12.584 --> 25:13.851
So you're a therapist?

25:13.919 --> 25:15.720
And a grief counselor.
up at the university.

25:15.787 --> 25:17.655
Right. you mentioned that
on the phone.

25:17.723 --> 25:20.791
The girl, the one that died,
she was a student there.

25:20.859 --> 25:22.760
Yeah. i'm trying to help
some of her friends

25:22.828 --> 25:24.261
Make sense
of the tragedy.

25:24.329 --> 25:25.930
Make sense
of a freak accident.

25:25.998 --> 25:27.698
How are you supposed
to do that?

25:27.766 --> 25:29.000
Well, sometimes
it can be comforting

25:29.067 --> 25:30.267
If people think
there's a reason

25:30.335 --> 25:31.769
Why something
like this happened.

25:31.837 --> 25:33.237
A woman runs a red light.

25:33.305 --> 25:35.072
Where's the reason in that?
good question.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.707
So, from
your point of view,

25:36.775 --> 25:38.776
There's no way
to explain
what happened.

25:38.844 --> 25:41.312
I didn't say that.
tell me.

25:41.380 --> 25:44.448
Well, there was a moment
just before the crash.

25:44.516 --> 25:47.284
I was making a left,
so i pulled out.

25:47.352 --> 25:49.520
Then i saw her coming.

25:49.588 --> 25:52.456
But there was still
plenty of time
for her to stop.

25:52.524 --> 25:55.393
Normally when
someone runs a red,

25:55.460 --> 25:58.662
You think cell phone
or make-up, a radio.

25:58.730 --> 26:00.498
You know, there's
some distraction.

26:00.565 --> 26:03.868
But she was staring
straight ahead.

26:05.971 --> 26:09.607
Her eyes glazed over
like--like she was frozen.

26:09.674 --> 26:11.175
Didn't even blink.

26:13.612 --> 26:14.812
Whoa!

26:14.880 --> 26:17.415
It was like
she was in a trance.

26:19.751 --> 26:23.287
In a trance.
that's what he said?

26:23.355 --> 26:26.090
She looked right at him,
but she didn't seem to see him.

26:26.158 --> 26:27.491
What would
make her do that?

26:27.559 --> 26:29.527
Plenty of things.
she could have been having

26:29.594 --> 26:31.295
What my father called
an "episode."

26:31.363 --> 26:32.963
She could have
gotten her meds wrong.

26:33.031 --> 26:34.632
Could have had too much wine
after dinner.

26:34.699 --> 26:36.133
Any one of which
can be confirmed

26:36.201 --> 26:37.701
With a little bit
of follow-up.

26:37.769 --> 26:39.136
Yeah.

26:39.204 --> 26:40.638
And prove to the ghost
that it wasn't a curse,

26:40.705 --> 26:43.307
And i can stop reading
my emails through
closed fingers.

26:44.342 --> 26:45.543
What if we can't
confirm it?

26:45.610 --> 26:47.344
What if we can't
find a reasonable
explanation?

26:47.412 --> 26:49.146
I got back
to mail with stamps.

26:49.214 --> 26:51.148
Shouldn't we be looking
for other explanations?

26:51.216 --> 26:53.417
Like what?
like, there's a curse.

26:53.485 --> 26:55.252
See, this is why
i think economics

26:55.320 --> 26:57.088
Would have been
a better choice
of major for you

26:57.155 --> 26:59.123
Than anthropology
of the occult.

26:59.191 --> 27:01.358
Come on, you're gonna
tell me you've never
thought about it?

27:01.426 --> 27:03.561
<i>you've read
the book of changes.</i>

27:03.628 --> 27:04.929
Yeah, but only
in the bright sunlight

27:04.996 --> 27:06.564
With garlic and a cross
wrapped around my neck.

27:06.631 --> 27:08.065
Because you know
there's more
out there

27:08.133 --> 27:09.467
Than what you can
see with your eyes.

27:09.534 --> 27:11.068
When i can hear it
with my ears, sure.

27:11.136 --> 27:13.337
But, ned, come on,
you're not going
to convince me

27:13.405 --> 27:15.506
That this email's
carrying some kind of spell.

27:15.574 --> 27:17.641
'cause you don't
believe in anything
you can't see or hear.

27:17.709 --> 27:19.677
I try not to.
yeah.

27:19.744 --> 27:23.047
It's not really
an option for me.

27:23.115 --> 27:25.483
I know ghosts
are real even though
i can't see them.

27:25.550 --> 27:27.318
What's hard
for me to believe

27:27.385 --> 27:30.387
Is that ghosts are
the only things out
there that i can't see.

27:37.629 --> 27:40.231

28:00.986 --> 28:02.853
Jim: hey. hey,
how are you doing there?

28:02.921 --> 28:04.488
I'm just checking in.

28:04.556 --> 28:06.357
Looks like i'm going
to be stuck here

28:06.424 --> 28:07.491
For another couple of hours.

28:07.559 --> 28:10.227
I wanted to tell you
something. it, uh,

28:10.295 --> 28:13.731
Looks like that email chain
finally reached the hospital.

28:13.798 --> 28:16.133
Two e.r. nurses,
dave in admitting,

28:16.201 --> 28:18.736
And, well, actually me.

28:18.803 --> 28:21.238
I'm thinking
you're probably
still with aiden.

28:21.306 --> 28:23.007
Call me now, huh?

28:23.074 --> 28:24.775
I won't do anything
till i hear from you.

28:24.843 --> 28:26.644
All right? bye.

28:30.015 --> 28:31.415
[thunder]

28:40.325 --> 28:42.660

28:46.631 --> 28:48.399
Aiden?

28:48.466 --> 28:50.134
Are you ok?

28:50.202 --> 28:51.969
Did you have
a bad dream?

28:52.037 --> 28:54.939
I don't know.
i don't remember.

28:55.006 --> 28:56.340
Did you?

28:56.408 --> 28:57.775
Kinda.

28:57.842 --> 28:59.476
Do you need a hug?

28:59.544 --> 29:01.212
Yeah.

29:04.249 --> 29:06.417
[gasping]

29:06.484 --> 29:08.285
Oh.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.639
[horn honking]
melinda: hey, aiden!

29:18.707 --> 29:20.508
Your lunch.

29:20.576 --> 29:22.243
Thanks!

29:22.311 --> 29:24.011
Don't come
with me, mom.

29:24.079 --> 29:25.980
I'm not. i'm just
gonna watch.

29:26.048 --> 29:27.048
Love you guys.

29:27.115 --> 29:29.450
Love you, too.
love you.

29:29.518 --> 29:30.551
[chuckles]

29:30.619 --> 29:32.220
God, he's so brave.

29:32.287 --> 29:33.888
[laughter]

29:33.956 --> 29:36.691
Hmm. it's because
he doesn't know
what you know.

29:36.758 --> 29:38.559
And he doesn't remember
his dreams.

29:38.627 --> 29:40.328
Hey, i'm so sorry
i wasn't here last night.

29:40.395 --> 29:41.662
That sounded
like a bad one.

29:41.730 --> 29:43.264
Yeah, it felt so real.

29:43.332 --> 29:44.932
Yeah.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.867
It feels pretty real
to gwen, too.

29:46.935 --> 29:49.070
She gets a creepy,
threatening email,

29:49.137 --> 29:50.738
She ignores
the warning
to forward it,

29:50.806 --> 29:52.573
And wham,
car accident,
she's dead.

29:52.641 --> 29:54.242
Her mother's hanging
by a thread.

29:54.309 --> 29:56.577
Yeah, i'm starting
to wonder about
the power of that email.

29:56.645 --> 29:58.312
How's an email
have power?

29:58.380 --> 29:59.981
Well, if there's
a ghost attached to it.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.649
The one who started
this whole thing,

30:01.717 --> 30:04.652
The one's who's feeding off
the fear it spreads.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.320
Wait, you're talking
about another ghost.

30:06.388 --> 30:07.355
Sally stitch?

30:07.422 --> 30:08.823
It would explain
my visions.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.359
You know, i mean,
ned said that
hundreds of years ago,

30:11.426 --> 30:13.928
There was this practice,
this punishment--

30:13.996 --> 30:16.264
Wait, wait, you don't
believe that there
really was a girl

30:16.331 --> 30:18.566
Who had her eyes
and mouth stitched shut

30:18.634 --> 30:21.002
And now she's creating
chain emails

30:21.069 --> 30:22.236
To do what?
spread the misery.

30:22.304 --> 30:23.904
I mean, if you can
reach thousands

30:23.972 --> 30:25.773
And millions of people
on the internet...

30:25.841 --> 30:27.575
You can spread
some misery.

30:27.643 --> 30:30.778
Wow. but now
the visions are
coming through aiden?

30:30.846 --> 30:32.913
I think he was
channeling them to me.

30:32.981 --> 30:34.815
I mean, they stopped
every time that he woke up.

30:34.883 --> 30:37.652
Although, they originally
came from her.

30:37.719 --> 30:41.188
All right.
so, you think
sally stitch

30:41.256 --> 30:44.392
Caused the accident
that killed gwen
and hurt her mom?

30:44.459 --> 30:47.061
The driver said
that she was staring at him,

30:47.129 --> 30:49.063
Like she was in
some kind of trance.

30:49.131 --> 30:51.232
Or if she was
blinded,

30:51.300 --> 30:53.000
Like you were
in your vision.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.369
Ok, see the wheels turning,
but what?

30:55.437 --> 30:56.804
You see, this accident,
it always bothered me,

30:56.872 --> 30:58.139
'cause it was
low impact.

30:58.206 --> 31:00.141
But then how does gwen's
mother end up in a coma?

31:00.208 --> 31:02.143
The doctors thought
the same thing, too,

31:02.210 --> 31:04.011
And they sent her
to an m.r.i.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.514
Yeah, so what
were they looking for?

31:06.581 --> 31:08.949
To see if she'd
had a stroke.

31:09.017 --> 31:10.718
I mean,
think about it.
it makes sense.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.286
You said in your
vision you weren't
totally blinded,

31:12.354 --> 31:13.454
You saw little
slivers of light?

31:13.522 --> 31:14.622
What i saw
through the stitches.

31:14.690 --> 31:16.157
That's what happens
to stroke victims.

31:16.224 --> 31:18.292
Before it goes black,
they see these little
pin pricks of light.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.460
You're brilliant!

31:19.528 --> 31:20.795
No. i think
i'm probably wrong.

31:20.862 --> 31:22.196
Yeah, but you're still
totally brilliant.

31:22.264 --> 31:23.764
I'm gonna be late.
look, i'll call you

31:23.832 --> 31:25.266
If i learn anything
from the hospital.

31:25.334 --> 31:26.534
Great.
[cell phone rings]

31:26.601 --> 31:27.635
Hey. what's up?

31:27.703 --> 31:29.670
Ok, so we couldn't
convince the ghost

31:29.738 --> 31:31.806
That an accident
was just that--
an accident.

31:31.873 --> 31:33.574
Well, jim is close.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.876
I'm proving
the email's a hoax
by locating its author.

31:35.944 --> 31:38.713
Impossible,
right? a needle in
a gazillion haystacks?

31:38.780 --> 31:40.614
Ah, i am sensing
triumph here.

31:40.682 --> 31:42.616
I found it.
hey, i helped!

31:42.684 --> 31:45.386
The creator of the email,
the evil mythical sally stitch,

31:45.454 --> 31:46.754
We got a name.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.723
J. miller.
hey!

31:48.790 --> 31:50.257
Ok, well, is this
j. miller alive?

31:50.325 --> 31:52.293
Not just alive, living.
and you'll never guess where.

31:52.361 --> 31:55.496
Right here in grandview.

31:55.564 --> 31:57.998
[siren]

31:58.066 --> 31:59.533
Woman on p.a.:
dr. morris, dial--

31:59.601 --> 32:01.202
Don't be
gender-biased here.

32:01.269 --> 32:03.037
Male, female, j. miller
could be anyone.

32:03.105 --> 32:04.772
Yeah, except
thankfully a ghost.

32:04.840 --> 32:05.973
Did you ever think
it might be?

32:06.041 --> 32:07.141
For a minute.

32:07.209 --> 32:08.542
A brief, dark minute.

32:08.610 --> 32:10.344
So we get double
brownie points

32:10.412 --> 32:12.513
Finding a living,
non-ghost person
wrote this email?

32:12.581 --> 32:14.482
Um, triple if this person
convinces gwen

32:14.549 --> 32:16.417
There's no spell.
[beep]

32:16.485 --> 32:18.786
Well, it may be
a moot point.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.654
I can't access
the employee files.

32:20.722 --> 32:22.990
Well, try harder.
this person works
here, or did.

32:23.058 --> 32:24.792
They've got a hospital
email address.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.961
Which would explain
how they knew gwen.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.231
Brianna said they both
volunteered here
over spring break.

32:30.298 --> 32:34.402
Uh, except the person
didn't actually work here.

32:34.469 --> 32:37.304
Her name's julia miller,
and she was a patient.

32:37.372 --> 32:38.806
Still is.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.708
According to this,
she has a.m.l.,

32:40.776 --> 32:42.877
An acute type
of leukemia.

32:42.944 --> 32:45.846
Patient? why would
she have a hospital
email address?

32:45.914 --> 32:47.515
Because she's lived here.

32:47.582 --> 32:50.551
Her whole life.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.993
Melinda:
she's just a child.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.628
She really lives here.

33:00.695 --> 33:02.329
Apparently,
the treatments

33:02.397 --> 33:04.231
Make julia
vulnerable
to infection.

33:04.299 --> 33:06.634
That's why
she couldn't leave.

33:06.701 --> 33:08.169
Can you imagine
growing up here?

33:08.236 --> 33:09.870
No, i can't.

33:09.938 --> 33:12.239
Maybe that's why
she made up sally stitch--

33:12.307 --> 33:13.707
A coping device.

33:13.775 --> 33:16.010
A way for her to deal
with the creepiness
of this place.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.344
She put a face to it.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.014
Do you think she has
any idea what she started?

33:23.952 --> 33:25.619
I'm going to go
look for her doctor,

33:25.687 --> 33:27.455
See what else
i can find out.

33:29.324 --> 33:31.692
I told you this would happen,
but you wouldn't listen.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.327
What happened?
what's wrong?

33:33.395 --> 33:35.162
You wouldn't do
what she wanted,

33:35.230 --> 33:36.665
And now she's dying!
who's dying?

33:36.666 --> 33:37.666
My mom.

33:37.732 --> 33:40.100
Woman on p.a.:
trauma team to i.c.u.
on six west.

33:40.168 --> 33:41.569
Oh, my god.

33:48.577 --> 33:50.444
[monitor beeping]

33:50.512 --> 33:52.580
Doctor: clear. clear!

33:56.017 --> 33:57.852
[monitor beeping rapidly]
give me one milligram of epi.

33:57.919 --> 33:59.620
[all talking at once]

34:29.233 --> 34:31.134
Jim: hey.
hey, how is she?

34:31.202 --> 34:32.502
Well, it was
touch and go.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.004
But we got her
in the i.c.u.,
and she's stabilized.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.273
Ok, so you were right.
i mean, did the m.r.i.
give any answers?

34:37.341 --> 34:39.509
That's why i wanted
to meet you out here.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.444
I'm really glad
you're helping
this woman, but--

34:41.512 --> 34:44.847
I totally understand, ok?
and i really am grateful
that you're helping me.

34:44.848 --> 34:49.848
***

34:48.985 --> 34:51.554
[exhales]

34:51.621 --> 34:53.856
There's a mass
on her brain stem.

34:53.924 --> 34:56.326
Cancer?
most likely.

34:56.393 --> 34:58.294
I mean, there's a chance
she might not have even
known she had it.

34:58.362 --> 34:59.963
These things can go
undiagnosed forever.

35:00.030 --> 35:01.598
Ok, so can it cause
a stroke?

35:01.665 --> 35:03.566
Yeah, it can cause
like a seizure.

35:03.634 --> 35:05.235
I mean, it's pretty
common with these
kinds of tumors.

35:05.302 --> 35:07.904
And then the m.r.i.
showed recent bleeding
into the tumor.

35:07.972 --> 35:11.307
Which would explain
the trance the other
driver described.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.610
Gwen had no idea
about the tumor.

35:13.677 --> 35:15.612
Her only explanation
was the email.

35:15.679 --> 35:17.947
I gotta get to her
right away.

35:18.015 --> 35:20.650
[thunder]

35:20.718 --> 35:22.785
[monitor beeping]

35:39.637 --> 35:41.571
[thunder]

35:47.378 --> 35:49.145
Gwen: what
do you want?

35:49.213 --> 35:51.381
I have to stay
with my mother.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.318
Gwen, the email
didn't cause any of this.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.353
Not on its own.

35:58.555 --> 36:00.490
You're wrong.

36:00.557 --> 36:02.759
Your mother isn't here
because she got hurt.

36:02.826 --> 36:05.228
She's here
because she's sick.

36:05.296 --> 36:06.863
That makes no sense.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.431
She has a brain tumor.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.400
That's what caused
the accident.

36:10.467 --> 36:12.402
She wasn't hit
by a curse.

36:12.469 --> 36:13.936
She had a seizure.

36:14.004 --> 36:15.571
You don't know what
you're talking about.

36:15.639 --> 36:16.839
My husband is a doctor here.

36:16.907 --> 36:18.574
It's all true.
i know what happened.

36:18.642 --> 36:20.443
She told me.
she warned me,

36:20.511 --> 36:22.612
And i'm not letting mom
get hurt again.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.014
Who is "she," your mother?

36:25.082 --> 36:26.449
You see ghosts.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.351
You'll find out.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.019
Find out what?

36:30.087 --> 36:32.221
[thunder]

36:41.532 --> 36:42.632
No!

36:42.700 --> 36:44.767
Please!

36:47.471 --> 36:50.340
Gwen, i'm sorry.

36:50.407 --> 36:52.008
No, it's not fair!

36:52.076 --> 36:54.977
I did what i was
supposed to, i made
them all forward it!

36:58.148 --> 36:59.949
Sweetheart,
you don't
understand.

37:00.017 --> 37:01.718
Understand what?

37:01.785 --> 37:03.820
She's right,
i've been sick.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.758
No.

37:08.826 --> 37:11.394
Mom, no.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.796
I can't believe
you've been sick--

37:13.864 --> 37:16.466
This sick,
and you never told me?

37:16.533 --> 37:17.734
Oh...

37:24.875 --> 37:28.244
I wanted to tell you
that night at dinner.

37:28.312 --> 37:33.015
But we were having
such a nice time,

37:33.083 --> 37:34.984
And you were so happy,

37:35.052 --> 37:37.086
And i knew that when

37:37.154 --> 37:40.256
I told you, we would
never have that again.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.825
I can't believe this.

37:45.028 --> 37:46.929
And i know you,
sweetheart.

37:46.997 --> 37:49.165
I know you would
want to quit school

37:49.233 --> 37:51.768
And do everything
you could to take
care of me.

37:51.835 --> 37:53.870
To help me.

37:53.937 --> 37:55.338
But no one
can help me.

37:55.406 --> 37:59.575
And i needed you to
accept that and not
blame yourself.

38:01.211 --> 38:04.147
You do blame yourself.

38:04.214 --> 38:07.483
I hope now that you can
realize it's not your fault.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.653
So she lied.

38:17.094 --> 38:18.895
Oh, sweetheart,

38:18.962 --> 38:21.230
None of it matters
anymore.

38:21.298 --> 38:22.732
Because...

38:24.034 --> 38:26.068
Because it's time
for us to go.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.006
We can go in there?

38:32.142 --> 38:33.876
We can be together?

38:33.944 --> 38:35.978
Yes, sweetheart.

38:36.046 --> 38:37.780
Forever.

38:41.051 --> 38:42.952
Thank you.

38:44.154 --> 38:45.655
Be careful.

38:45.722 --> 38:47.890
I will.

39:07.391 --> 39:10.591
Jim, we need to talk. - What?
Before she crossed over,

39:10.647 --> 39:12.515
Gwen was talking
like she kept her
end of the bargain.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.417
She said, "she lied,
she warned me,
she told me."

39:14.485 --> 39:15.718
Who? her mother?

39:15.786 --> 39:17.220
Well, that's what
i thought at first.

39:17.287 --> 39:19.589
I mean, paula's
brain tumor would
explain the accident,

39:19.656 --> 39:20.857
But not the visions,

39:20.924 --> 39:22.425
Or the email,
for that matter.

39:22.493 --> 39:25.127
Uh, you're losing me.

39:25.195 --> 39:26.796
The little girl
that eli and i saw,

39:26.864 --> 39:28.564
The one who
lives here
at the hospital,

39:28.632 --> 39:30.900
She doesn't seem
like she'd start
a terror campaign.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.335
Wait a minute, that's where
we're going with this?

39:32.402 --> 39:33.503
Yeah, i want
to talk to her.

39:33.570 --> 39:34.770
She can't be
in this alone.

39:34.838 --> 39:36.506
[sighs] who's in there
with her?

39:36.573 --> 39:37.707
Or what?

39:37.774 --> 39:40.309
Gwen said,
"you see ghosts,
you'll find out."

39:45.182 --> 39:46.582
Excuse me,
do you know

39:46.650 --> 39:48.017
Who requested
no visitors?

39:48.085 --> 39:49.619
Was it her parents,
a doctor?

39:49.686 --> 39:51.921
She told her parents
she wants to be left alone.

39:51.989 --> 39:53.823
Ah.

39:57.294 --> 39:58.761
[thunder]

40:00.597 --> 40:02.598
Julia: scarlet.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.569
Scarlet.

40:06.637 --> 40:09.005
Where are you?

40:09.072 --> 40:12.174
I've been looking for you.

40:12.242 --> 40:14.544
I've been waiting for you.

40:14.611 --> 40:16.612
[thunder]

40:19.249 --> 40:22.184
That was good, right?

40:22.252 --> 40:24.220
I did good?

40:24.288 --> 40:26.789
[thunder]

40:30.327 --> 40:32.728
Did i do everything just
like you wanted me to?

40:37.301 --> 40:39.569
Woman: you did well.

40:39.636 --> 40:41.270
What do we do now?

40:41.338 --> 40:42.438
Nothing.

40:42.506 --> 40:45.575
Just wait.

40:45.576 --> 40:47.976
Wait for what?
You'll see.

40:48.277 --> 40:49.977
They'll all see.
