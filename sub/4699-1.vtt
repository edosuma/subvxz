02:15.485 --> 02:16.315
'cause my bike broke down!

02:16.486 --> 02:17.316
Yeah, tell it to Martinez!

02:17.487 --> 02:18.511
He's used to hearin'
that bullshit.

02:18.688 --> 02:19.882
On your feet.
Come on.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.318
Hands on your head.

02:21.491 --> 02:23.083
Don't get gitchy.
Relax.

02:23.259 --> 02:24.590
How about I just give you
a little somethin', huh?

02:24.761 --> 02:26.956
A little somethin' to
make this go away, maybe?

02:27.130 --> 02:29.121
Come on, Tyson.
Fuckin' bounty hunters...

02:29.299 --> 02:31.062
don't make no real cheese,
anyway, do ya?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.861
Get on the--

02:34.003 --> 02:35.493
You ain't got no money,
'cause if you did...

02:35.672 --> 02:37.037
you wouldn't live
in a trailer park.

02:37.207 --> 02:38.105
I ain't goin' back
to fuckin' jail.

02:38.274 --> 02:39.741
Oh, yeah. You goin'.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.968
Baby!

02:42.145 --> 02:45.046
Get off of my motherfuckin'
boyfriend!

02:45.215 --> 02:46.705
-Get out of my house!
-Oh, shit!

02:54.858 --> 02:57.452
Oh, shit!

02:59.262 --> 03:01.924

Get his ass, baby, get him !

03:02.065 --> 03:03.532

Blast that motherfucker!

03:08.404 --> 03:09.496
I'll be goddamned!

03:16.412 --> 03:17.674
Crazy ho!

03:25.788 --> 03:26.982

03:38.268 --> 03:41.032
Got your ass now!
Uh-huh, motherfucker!

03:52.248 --> 03:53.579
Hands behind your back!

03:53.750 --> 03:55.445
You're goin' to fuckin' jail!

05:51.267 --> 05:53.167
Where is he?

05:53.336 --> 05:54.667
I took him to County.

05:54.837 --> 05:57.863
County?! I was supposed
to take him to County.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.474
You were supposed to
take him to County?

05:59.642 --> 06:00.472
Yeah.

06:00.643 --> 06:01.940
I didn't hear that part.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.705
Bucum, why is it every time
I send you out on a job...

06:04.881 --> 06:05.745
there are always
gunshots reported?

06:05.915 --> 06:06.973
Why is that?

06:07.150 --> 06:09.778
Because people don't mind
their own fuckin' business.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.249
If they stay outta mine's...

06:11.421 --> 06:12.911
you wouldn't hear
gunshots reported.

06:13.089 --> 06:14.818
Oh, that's very funny.

06:14.991 --> 06:15.958
sorry if I forgot to laugh...

06:16.125 --> 06:17.319
but I've been on the phone
for an hour...

06:17.493 --> 06:19.552
and 27 minutes straight
with Miami PD...

06:19.729 --> 06:21.219
-cleanin' up your shit.
-And?

06:21.397 --> 06:23.490
What you want me to do?
start knockin' on the door?

06:23.666 --> 06:24.792
"Hey, Martinez
wanna holler at you.

06:24.967 --> 06:25.831
"Come with me."

06:26.002 --> 06:27.196
Or do you want me to
go in and get 'em?

06:27.370 --> 06:29.770
Oh, you get 'em.
It's just how you get 'em.

06:29.939 --> 06:30.769
Get you when I come out.

06:30.940 --> 06:31.929
-Got it.
-I'm talkin' to you!

06:32.108 --> 06:32.972
You walkin' away from me?

06:33.142 --> 06:34.439
Yeah. I've got to find
the sports section.

06:34.610 --> 06:35.941
Look at this, huh?

06:36.112 --> 06:37.704
It's my second pack
of cigarettes this morning...

06:37.880 --> 06:39.245
and I just quit today.

06:40.416 --> 06:43.817
Jesus Christ. Why do I
even bother with this guy?

06:44.921 --> 06:46.912
Hey, Pam, what's shakin'?

06:47.090 --> 06:48.682
Nothin' but ass.

06:48.858 --> 06:50.723
Did the Heat beat
the Knicks last night?

06:50.893 --> 06:52.918
The Heat lost by one point.

06:53.096 --> 06:55.997
I put your little fish
on your desk over there.

07:02.105 --> 07:04.972
I heard you almost
got shot again today.

07:05.141 --> 07:06.073
Almost don't count.

07:06.242 --> 07:07.231
You should have
took me with you.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.399
I could have had your back.

07:08.578 --> 07:10.808
-Maybe next time.
-Right.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.242
Well, anyway, next time
you decide...

07:12.415 --> 07:13.973
you want to spend $600
on a fish...

07:14.150 --> 07:15.515
why don't you just
send me to st. Thomas...

07:15.685 --> 07:17.175
and I can catch
his little ass for you.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.287
Change, please.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.582
Don't make me mess up my nails.

07:23.426 --> 07:25.257
Thank you, Pam.

07:25.428 --> 07:26.656
It's a little short.

07:29.632 --> 07:32.897
You know what you need,
Bucum? A partner.

07:33.069 --> 07:35.196
somebody to help you
apprehend these guys...

07:35.371 --> 07:37.396
without shots being
fired all the time.

07:37.573 --> 07:39.473
Well, stop bullshittin'
and put me on the payroll!

07:39.642 --> 07:43.043
I can get some real bonds, maybe
I can get a fuckin' Tonto.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.737
You know I can't insure you.
You're too high a risk.

07:47.016 --> 07:48.506
I don't see nobody else
in here...

07:48.684 --> 07:51.084
bringin' Lil J in,
so insured or not...

07:51.254 --> 07:53.848
I'm the best nigga you got,
so can I at least get paid?

07:54.023 --> 07:56.787
Little more grip,
little less lip.

08:05.635 --> 08:06.761
You know what?

08:08.271 --> 08:10.466
At these prices, man,
I might have to...

08:10.640 --> 08:11.971
go in business for myself.

08:12.141 --> 08:15.304
Bucum P I. firm ain't soundin'
too bad right about now.

08:15.478 --> 08:16.410
Ain't that right, Pam?

08:16.579 --> 08:19.139
Yep...or you could
win the lottery.

08:19.315 --> 08:21.078
You know, it's up to
$60 million right now.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.945
And we got a pool goin'
in my apartment complex.

08:23.119 --> 08:24.086
I can get you in on it.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.481
Black people don't
win that shit.

08:25.655 --> 08:27.555
You either gotta be
old or Puerto Rican.

08:27.723 --> 08:29.657
Here's your next rabbit.

08:29.825 --> 08:31.759
He went shy on us four days ago.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.327
Reggie Wright?

08:33.496 --> 08:36.260
I done caught this motherfucker,
like, three times already!

08:36.432 --> 08:39.162
This nigga go to jail
more than Robert Downey Jr.

08:39.335 --> 08:41.496
What'd he do this time, man?

08:41.671 --> 08:43.035
same charge.
Petty con man stuff.

08:43.206 --> 08:44.696
He just never goes to court.

08:44.874 --> 08:47.570
Oh, that's a $35,000
bond you got there...

08:47.743 --> 08:50.940
which means you get
a whole $3,500.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.047
Oh, damn. Let me put
that new Bentley...

08:53.216 --> 08:54.274
I was lookin' at on layaway.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.214
Bucum, I don't know what
you're lookin' for here...

08:57.386 --> 08:58.375
so you're gonna have to
hit the lottery...

08:58.554 --> 08:59.578
with Pam over there...

08:59.755 --> 09:02.019
or stop buying
$600 fuckin' fish...

09:02.191 --> 09:03.590
that are gonna die
in a week anyway...

09:03.759 --> 09:06.626
and maybe you can put that
Bentley on layaway, huh?

09:06.796 --> 09:09.196
You know what, Martinez?
Fuck what you're talking about.

09:09.365 --> 09:11.265
It's a whole lot of money
out there.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.334
All I gotta do
is put my name on it.

09:14.337 --> 09:17.500
Fifty bucks'll get
you sixty million.

09:17.673 --> 09:19.072
Thank you, Pam.

09:19.242 --> 09:21.073
When I quit,
you gonna miss me.

09:21.244 --> 09:23.974
Come on, Zo.
I hate this fuckin' job.

09:24.146 --> 09:27.138
You know what?
I'm gonna be where I'm at.

10:00.783 --> 10:03.047
There's somebody looking at us.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.042
Oh, are these the ones
we're lookin' for?

10:38.220 --> 10:40.688
I believe so, but I left
my glasses at home.

10:40.856 --> 10:43.120
Maybe I can find somebody who--

10:43.292 --> 10:45.658
what the hell are you
lookin' at, dipshit?

10:45.828 --> 10:48.456
Why don't you let us
shop in peace?

10:48.631 --> 10:50.656
Who you two little spice Girls
think y'all talkin' to?

10:50.833 --> 10:51.959
-You!
-You!

10:52.134 --> 10:53.066
Y'all followin' me around
this damn store...

10:53.235 --> 10:54.395
you know what I'm sayin'?

10:54.570 --> 10:57.038
I'm gonna get in line before
I have to fuck one of y'all up.

10:57.206 --> 10:58.867
That's right. Gang member.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.975
You go get in line...

11:01.143 --> 11:01.939
Poop dog!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.102
Oh! Good!

11:05.815 --> 11:07.680
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:07.850 --> 11:10.011
Mr. sheldon, what's happenin'?

11:10.186 --> 11:11.847
How many times am I
gonna have to tell you...

11:12.021 --> 11:14.819
don't open the potato chips
until you pay for 'em !

11:14.990 --> 11:16.184
You gonna have to tell me that
all the time...

11:16.359 --> 11:17.849
'cause I like potato chips.

11:18.027 --> 11:19.585
Mr. sheldon, why you
sweatin' me, man?

11:19.762 --> 11:21.252
I come in here all the time.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.057
'Cause you're a nickel
and dime hustler...

11:23.232 --> 11:25.427
Looking for the five-finger
discount...

11:25.601 --> 11:27.933
and I have to keep
my eyes on you.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.004
Then you know what? I'm a start
goin' to Dwight's...

11:30.172 --> 11:31.605
'cause you don't laugh
at my jokes or nothin'.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.368
-Dwight who?
-D'wight around your lip.

11:34.543 --> 11:36.306
No. I'm just kiddin',
Mr. sheldon.

11:36.479 --> 11:38.538
Look, my woman gave me
these numbers to play.

11:38.714 --> 11:41.581
15...30...

11:42.585 --> 11:45.281
37...38...

11:45.454 --> 11:47.046
45...

11:47.223 --> 11:48.349
47.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.660
45, 47

11:58.801 --> 12:00.860
Just hurry up. I got
customers to serve here.

12:01.036 --> 12:01.934
45, 4--

12:02.071 --> 12:03.902
All right.
How much I owe you?

12:04.073 --> 12:05.062
7 50.

12:05.241 --> 12:07.004
7 50.

12:07.176 --> 12:09.736
It's 50, not 7 50.

12:09.912 --> 12:13.075
Mr. sheldon, man, I'm gonna
kick your ass one day, man.

12:13.249 --> 12:14.238
I seen you comin' out
of the nursing home...

12:14.417 --> 12:15.406
the other day. I started to--

12:17.253 --> 12:18.777
I'm gonna quit
comin' in here, man.

12:18.954 --> 12:20.148
-Hater, man!
-Later.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.414
Hey, I seen you at the club...

12:21.590 --> 12:23.285
pimpin' the other night,
there, pimp.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.150
Oh, excuse me!

12:26.328 --> 12:28.819
Don't let me catch your skinny
ass outside, do you hear me?

12:28.998 --> 12:30.829
You know what?
I just got out of the pen...

12:31.000 --> 12:31.830
for some shit like this.

12:32.001 --> 12:32.933
Come on, come on!

12:33.102 --> 12:34.694
Let me get out. Y'all
smell just like Geritol.

12:34.870 --> 12:36.633
Could y'all move?!

12:49.151 --> 12:51.119
You're still talkin' shit,
bitch?

12:51.287 --> 12:53.221
Y'all gonna get me
fuckin' locked up!

12:53.389 --> 12:54.788
Come on, over here.

12:58.461 --> 12:59.860
How was that, Reggie?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.724
Y'all put a little bit
too much on it that time.

13:01.897 --> 13:04.457
The next time, just cut back
on the bullshit talk.

13:04.633 --> 13:05.793
That way, the scam'll
go smoother.

13:05.968 --> 13:07.299
You know I know.
I'm a thief.

13:07.470 --> 13:08.994
Bless you, Reggie.
Thank you so much!

13:09.171 --> 13:11.765
Our check didn't come, and we
needed a few extra things.

13:11.941 --> 13:13.841
That's OK. I love you,
Ms. steinberg.

13:14.009 --> 13:15.670
What are them for?

13:15.845 --> 13:18.473
These are for when
I need to get my freak on!

13:20.282 --> 13:22.443
Watch yourself!
shake it fast!

13:22.618 --> 13:23.778
Watch yourself!

13:23.953 --> 13:25.352
show me what you're
workin' with!

13:25.521 --> 13:27.989
I said, show me what
you're working with!

13:28.157 --> 13:30.455
I said--there go
the police. Run.

13:30.626 --> 13:32.059
-Oh, run!
-Come on, baby.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.698
Bucum !

13:47.309 --> 13:48.970
Don't you run from me!

14:25.047 --> 14:27.515
Move! Move it!

15:24.974 --> 15:26.601
Damn!

15:49.331 --> 15:51.162
You told me to point it
right at that area.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.766
I told you to do
your fucking job...

15:52.935 --> 15:54.163
Fran-fucking-cesco!

15:54.336 --> 15:56.930
No makeup!

15:58.540 --> 16:02.977
You fucking twit!
Bloody fucking Miamians!

16:03.145 --> 16:05.807
You're getting the sack,
and you're on the fucking dole!

16:05.981 --> 16:08.449
The whole lot of you!
Rank amateurs!

16:08.617 --> 16:10.448
You stink to high
fuckin' heaven!

16:10.619 --> 16:13.019
Fuck Miami!

16:13.188 --> 16:18.125
Mr. Barkley, right.

16:19.495 --> 16:21.895
It's good to see you, sir.

16:22.064 --> 16:22.894
Welcome. You're right on time.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.533
I love that seersucker.
Quite posh.

16:25.701 --> 16:28.101
Hello. shall we go to the set?

16:32.074 --> 16:34.406
This is beautiful!

16:34.576 --> 16:37.374
What we have here is a world
turned upside down.

16:37.546 --> 16:38.706
We've got mirrors.
We've got reflecting pools.

16:38.881 --> 16:41.372
We've got narcissism.
We've got self-indulgence.

16:41.550 --> 16:44.144
It's all bullshit, isn't it,
really, Mr. Barkley...

16:44.319 --> 16:46.685
but we're gonna get some
nice photographs, aren't we?

16:46.855 --> 16:48.186
some nice photographs.

16:48.357 --> 16:50.018
Now the diamonds, please.

16:50.192 --> 16:53.423
Nice and sexy.
sexy, darling.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.619
sexy for me.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.226
Come on. Yeah! That's it!

16:59.401 --> 17:02.393
Gimme legs, gimme legs.
Yeah, fantastic!

17:02.571 --> 17:04.198
Fucking brilliant!

17:04.373 --> 17:07.467
Nice work! Yeah! Camera!

17:09.712 --> 17:10.770
A 6-4-5.

17:10.945 --> 17:12.106
-What?
-I want a 6-4-5.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.407
What are you talking about?
You said to load the 6-7.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.710
I want a 6-4-5!

17:16.885 --> 17:19.580
You know the difference
between 6-7 and 6-4-5?

17:19.755 --> 17:20.847
Yes, I do.

17:21.022 --> 17:22.285
Fran-fucking-cesco!

17:22.458 --> 17:23.685
My name is Frank!

17:29.098 --> 17:34.627
Listen, I know I've been
a bit rough.

17:36.238 --> 17:41.403
I've abused you.
I'd like to apologize.

17:41.577 --> 17:42.407
Frank, is it?

17:42.578 --> 17:43.408
Yeah.

17:43.579 --> 17:44.409
Yeah. I'm sorry, Frank.

17:44.580 --> 17:45.604
No. I'm sorry.

17:45.781 --> 17:46.770
Nice nails.

17:47.783 --> 17:51.617
I'll get the camera.
Good lad.

18:04.466 --> 18:05.899
No makeup.

18:10.806 --> 18:13.001
Ramose, you didn't
have to shoot the assistant...

18:13.175 --> 18:14.267
and the makeup woman, did you?

18:14.443 --> 18:15.535
We had to make it look good.

18:15.711 --> 18:17.872
The only good witness
is a dead witness.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.541
Good shot.
Let's get the diamonds.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.993
Where is this skinny son of a...

18:37.132 --> 18:38.030
-Gotcha!
-Goddamn!

18:38.200 --> 18:39.758
Hold on, Zo.

19:10.032 --> 19:13.468
Excuse me, you see
a skinny guy run back here?

19:57.779 --> 19:59.212
Who was that?

19:59.381 --> 20:00.905
It must have been
one of Barkley's men.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.608
so that little creep
tried to double cross us.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.047
I'm glad we got him first.

20:05.220 --> 20:07.484
You better check those diamonds.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.427
Did you like my accent?
It was pretty good, wasn't it?

20:16.598 --> 20:19.362
Kind of like Michael Caine
in "Alfie"?

20:19.534 --> 20:20.432
I love that film.

20:20.602 --> 20:22.126
-They're fake.
-They're what?!

20:22.304 --> 20:23.532
They're fakes.

20:23.705 --> 20:25.263
They can't be fakes.
They have to be real.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.533
You cannot have
an insurance claim...

20:27.709 --> 20:29.836
with fake diamonds.
He was in on the deal.

20:30.012 --> 20:31.946
Do you think I'm fucking
stupid?! They're fake!

20:32.114 --> 20:33.979
Check them again, Ursula.

20:34.149 --> 20:34.979
He left a letter.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.378
"sorry for the inconvenience.

20:36.551 --> 20:38.280
"You'll get your diamonds
tomorrow.

20:38.453 --> 20:40.250
"They're in a safe
and well-guarded place.

20:40.422 --> 20:41.252
"I just had to make sure...

20:41.423 --> 20:42.583
"everything would happen
as planned.

20:42.758 --> 20:45.022
"see you soon. That's
if I'm still alive. Ha ha."

20:46.929 --> 20:47.953
so we blew it.

20:48.130 --> 20:49.290
Do you know what he'll do
when he finds out...

20:49.464 --> 20:51.091
we fucked up
a $20 million deal?

20:51.266 --> 20:52.665
$20 million?!

20:52.834 --> 20:55.325
No. I have no idea what he's
going to do, darling.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.597
I'm not the one
who's fucking him !

20:57.773 --> 20:59.365
I gotta get up out of here.

21:24.766 --> 21:26.859
This is no good.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.866
What's your boyfriend
gonna say?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.026
We've gotta call TJ and Roscoe.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.035
They know what to do
with the van.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.195
Check if there's
anything in there.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.807
Oh, shit!

21:40.182 --> 21:42.446
I know you wonder
what I'm doin' here!

21:42.617 --> 21:43.811
Who the fuck are you?

21:43.986 --> 21:45.715
Look, don't shoot me,
dude, for real.

21:45.887 --> 21:46.876
Ursula!

21:48.490 --> 21:49.684
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

21:49.858 --> 21:51.723
Look. I work for Mr. Barkley.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.326
He ain't tryin' to
fuck y'all or nothin'.

21:53.495 --> 21:54.519
He put me in this van...

21:54.696 --> 21:56.186
to make sure everything
was all right.

21:56.365 --> 21:58.424
I got the real diamonds
in my pocket right now.

22:00.469 --> 22:02.130
Hand 'em over.

22:02.304 --> 22:03.635
I'm gonna show 'em
to you right now.

22:06.174 --> 22:07.607
Don't shoot!

22:10.479 --> 22:11.946
shit!

22:13.048 --> 22:15.380
Don't shoot the boats!

22:20.255 --> 22:21.552
Get him !

22:36.571 --> 22:37.970
Fuck!

22:39.908 --> 22:41.273
"Reginald Wright."

22:41.443 --> 22:42.842
Let's get out of here.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.105
Reginald Wright.

22:48.383 --> 22:54.185
Reginald fucking Wright,
I got your ass.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.651
Unlock it.

23:33.528 --> 23:35.018
so, what about you?

23:35.197 --> 23:37.290
You got anything to
add to your story?

23:37.466 --> 23:40.458
No. Y'all know
everything I know.

23:43.872 --> 23:45.635
Get out of here.

23:49.111 --> 23:51.079
Control this thug.
That's all I gotta say.

23:51.246 --> 23:53.840
Or next time,
he will go to jail.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.710
Thanks a lot.

23:55.884 --> 23:57.408
Call you later.

24:02.491 --> 24:04.550
How long you think
it'd take a man...

24:04.726 --> 24:06.489
to run from one end of
this walkway to another?

24:06.661 --> 24:08.993
What difference does it make?
You're off the file.

24:09.164 --> 24:11.598
What?! Bullshit!
Reggie's my rabbit.

24:11.766 --> 24:16.169
Not anymore. Miami P D.
is all over it!

24:16.338 --> 24:17.305
How you gonna give...

24:17.472 --> 24:19.997
these tight-ass motherfuckers
my job, Martinez?

24:20.175 --> 24:21.665
You know I need that money.

24:21.843 --> 24:23.140
I didn't give it away.

24:23.311 --> 24:24.608
They took it, so get over it.

24:24.779 --> 24:26.269
Go relax or something.

24:26.448 --> 24:28.109
Get you some pussy,
for chrissake.

24:28.283 --> 24:29.648
Yeah? My money feels
better than pussy.

24:29.818 --> 24:31.911
Oh, yeah? That's the kind
of money I want.

24:32.087 --> 24:33.645
Meanwhile, here you go.

24:33.822 --> 24:34.686
I don't--

24:34.856 --> 24:37.450
Look, look. Look here.
Go ahead! Take it.

24:37.626 --> 24:38.957
There's your money,
all right?

24:39.127 --> 24:40.856
Thanks for nothin'.
Now, leave it alone.

24:41.029 --> 24:42.189
Leave it alone!

24:42.364 --> 24:45.231
Do not touch Reggie Wright.
I said it once...

24:45.400 --> 24:46.833
I'm not gonna fuckin'
say it again.

24:47.002 --> 24:50.028
I almost got shot over
a bullshit misdemeanor.

24:50.205 --> 24:52.196
That ain't even Reggie's m.o. !

24:52.374 --> 24:54.205
Not even a little bit!

24:54.376 --> 24:56.401
so, I know somethin'
is goin' down.

24:56.578 --> 24:57.510
I can feel it.

24:57.679 --> 24:59.112
OK, smart ass.

24:59.281 --> 25:01.340
The next time the cops
get you, they got you!

25:01.516 --> 25:03.040
I'm not comin' down here,
period.

25:03.218 --> 25:04.048
You're on your own.

25:04.219 --> 25:05.447
You're too good
for your own good.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.383
You're gonna get blackballed
from this business one day.

25:07.556 --> 25:09.547
You're gonna end up
back at that dog track...

25:09.724 --> 25:10.713
shoveling shit
where I found you.

25:10.892 --> 25:14.157
Mark my words.
Mark my fuckin' words!

25:17.499 --> 25:19.899
Thanks, Martinez.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.427
I love you, too.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.039
Rag-top son of a bitch.

25:34.316 --> 25:36.409
Damn.

25:38.853 --> 25:40.411
Zo.

25:42.757 --> 25:44.418
This--

25:48.930 --> 25:51.160
$600.

25:54.703 --> 25:58.434
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

25:58.607 --> 26:01.474
All these tips.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.133
I could've stayed home
for this shit.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.906
Next up, this week's Florida
state winning lottery numbers.

26:09.951 --> 26:11.578
santa Maria, santa Maria,
santa Maria...

26:13.521 --> 26:15.113
Hey, baby, you play my ticket?

26:15.290 --> 26:16.120
You play my lotto?

26:16.291 --> 26:17.121
I played it.

26:17.292 --> 26:18.122
Have you seen my santa Maria?

26:18.293 --> 26:19.658
The one with the gold crown?

26:19.828 --> 26:20.726
Nah, baby.

26:20.895 --> 26:23.728
I almost got killed
just a minute ago.

26:23.898 --> 26:25.798
You seen Bucum
anywhere around here?

26:27.302 --> 26:28.132
The one that locked me up
fifteen times--

26:28.303 --> 26:29.133
the bounty hunter.

26:29.304 --> 26:30.236
Big, stocky dude.

26:30.405 --> 26:33.431
Where the fuck...got it.

26:33.608 --> 26:35.007
Baby, lotto's coming on.

26:35.176 --> 26:37.144
I don't care about
no damn lotto.

26:37.312 --> 26:38.904
I got chased by
a motherfucking Mexican...

26:39.080 --> 26:40.911
and a big white bitch today.

26:41.082 --> 26:42.913
Looking like
a project power ranger...

26:43.084 --> 26:44.642
chasing me all over this place.

26:44.819 --> 26:46.514
What are you talking about,
Reggie?

26:46.688 --> 26:47.518
There was some kind
of diamond heist...

26:47.689 --> 26:49.247
near the beach today, right?

26:49.424 --> 26:50.516
Bucum chasing me.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.159
I'm running.
I accidentally hid...

26:52.327 --> 26:54.192
in the back of
the damn crooks' van.

26:54.362 --> 26:55.351
A diamond heist, Reggie?

26:55.530 --> 26:56.622
Then they tried to kill me.

26:56.798 --> 26:59.198
so, what happened after that?
How did you escape?

26:59.367 --> 27:01.892
How did I escape?
You know how I escaped.

27:02.003 --> 27:03.493
I fought my way
up out of there.

27:03.672 --> 27:06.334
I hit about five dudes, knocked
about three bitches down.

27:06.508 --> 27:07.338
You know I don't play, Gina.

27:07.509 --> 27:09.374
Baby, you can't fight.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.977
Who can't fight?
I was knockin'.

27:11.146 --> 27:12.204
I hit this one dude.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.143
He ran up on me.
I was, like, "Mmm !"

27:14.316 --> 27:15.544
He hit me in the head twice.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.378
And I did. Look. And I grabbed--

27:17.552 --> 27:19.144
And then he hit me
one more time.

27:19.321 --> 27:20.253
You can't tell me--

27:20.422 --> 27:22.356
see, I'm nervous
and paranoid, man.

27:22.524 --> 27:23.752
Come here and sit down.
Come here.

27:23.925 --> 27:25.153
Come here. Give me some.

27:26.528 --> 27:28.428
30.

27:28.596 --> 27:29.585
The second number is...

27:29.764 --> 27:31.061
I'm nervous as shit, man.

27:31.232 --> 27:32.631
47.

27:32.801 --> 27:34.701
The third number is...

27:35.704 --> 27:36.534
37.

27:36.705 --> 27:38.866
The fourth number is 38.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.974
The fifth number is 45...

27:41.142 --> 27:44.543
and the last number is 15.

27:44.713 --> 27:46.510
And remember,
when you play, we all win.

28:06.868 --> 28:09.666
Oh, shit!

28:39.901 --> 28:41.163
We're rich!

28:42.303 --> 28:43.930
What? What?

28:46.141 --> 28:47.199
I want to see the ticket.

28:47.375 --> 28:50.276
I got it. Let me get
the motherfucking thing.

28:51.346 --> 28:53.439
Goddamn, it feels good
to have money.

28:53.615 --> 28:55.583
I feel like a new woman, baby.

28:55.750 --> 28:58.082
Oh, shit. I got so much
shit to buy, man.

28:58.253 --> 28:59.743
Those Gucci heels
I've been wanting to buy...

28:59.921 --> 29:01.354
for, like, four years now.

29:01.523 --> 29:02.922
You know, those ho pumps
you like?

29:03.091 --> 29:04.649
I got to go to Versace.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.794
I got to call the bank
and say, "Fuck you."

29:06.961 --> 29:08.724
I'm feeling good.

29:08.897 --> 29:11.229
-I lost my wallet.
-What?

29:11.399 --> 29:13.094
But where's the ticket?

29:13.268 --> 29:15.828
-The ticket's in my wallet.
-What?

29:16.004 --> 29:20.407
The ticket is in the wallet,
and I lost my wallet.

29:22.243 --> 29:23.540
That's what I said.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.613
-Reginald?
-What?

29:26.781 --> 29:28.214
Are you telling me
you lost the ticket?

29:28.383 --> 29:29.941
I lost my wallet,
and the ticket was in it.

29:30.118 --> 29:32.018
Baby, are you telling me
you lost the ticket?

29:32.187 --> 29:34.678
-I lost my wallet.
-No, you fucking didn't!

29:34.856 --> 29:36.289
Baby, it was in my...

29:36.458 --> 29:39.484
Oh, my God.
Holy fu--OK.

29:39.661 --> 29:42.152
No. All right.
You know what?

29:42.330 --> 29:44.230
-I came through here.
-It's OK.

29:44.399 --> 29:45.866
-I came back.
-All right.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.626
Motherfucker.
I came...

29:47.802 --> 29:49.531
OK. Let's not panic.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.137
Let's not panic and
Let's think, Reginald.

29:51.306 --> 29:53.274
Let's think.
When was the last time...

29:53.441 --> 29:55.375
you saw your wallet, baby?

29:55.543 --> 29:56.703
I was coming out the store.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.039
I had been dealing with
Ms. steinberg and them, right?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.114
All of the sudden, baby,
I seen Bucum.

30:01.282 --> 30:02.340
He start chasing me.

30:02.517 --> 30:06.146
I'm running down the alley,
and I jumped in the van.

30:06.321 --> 30:07.754
Boat yard!
Where's your keys?

30:07.922 --> 30:09.651
What, what? On the dresser.
What boat yard?

30:09.824 --> 30:11.792
I'm going to get my wallet.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.895
Baby, what boat yard?

30:15.063 --> 30:16.052
What boat yard?

30:24.138 --> 30:28.006
I don't have
any fucking patience.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.912
And my name and my reputation
are on the line here.

30:37.085 --> 30:40.851
That's very fucking
embarrassing!

30:41.022 --> 30:45.356
And I don't like
to be embarrassed.

30:48.429 --> 30:51.455
Was that fucking embarrassing?

30:55.970 --> 30:56.959
You.

30:58.673 --> 31:03.770
Tell me one more time how this
fucking asshole escaped...

31:03.945 --> 31:06.880
because it's just so
un-fucking-believable...

31:07.048 --> 31:08.174
I want to hear it again.

31:08.349 --> 31:10.613
He was in the back of the van.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.480
There was some photographic
equipment back there...

31:12.654 --> 31:13.848
including a light.

31:14.022 --> 31:15.114
He shined the light on us.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.850
I got temporarily distracted,
and he got away.

31:18.026 --> 31:18.856
What distracted you?

31:19.027 --> 31:20.289
I was blinded by the light.

31:20.461 --> 31:21.894
-Blinded?
-Blinded.

31:22.063 --> 31:23.325
-show me.
-show you what?

31:23.498 --> 31:25.363
show me how you were
fucking blinded.

31:25.533 --> 31:26.465
I put my hands up.

31:26.634 --> 31:28.602
so put your fucking
hands up, then!

31:28.770 --> 31:30.431
Just keep it like that.

31:30.605 --> 31:31.765
Look at this guy.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.877
Fuck.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.719
You take care of this
Reggie Wright character...

31:46.888 --> 31:48.617
before he goes running
to the police.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.849
Otherwise...

31:51.025 --> 31:53.550
I'll be taking care of you.

31:53.728 --> 31:55.855
Now get the fuck
out of my office.

31:56.030 --> 31:57.759
You get that cleaned up.

32:02.470 --> 32:06.031
This has been the worst day
of my fucking life...

32:06.207 --> 32:08.437
and if one of you fucks
don't put it right...

32:08.610 --> 32:11.204
it's going to be the worst day
in your lives.

32:11.379 --> 32:13.404
You understand?

32:13.581 --> 32:16.414
You get the fuck
out of my office!

32:19.187 --> 32:21.917
Everybody.

32:27.061 --> 32:29.996
I just want to get
my diamonds, OK

32:30.164 --> 32:31.688
I'm sorry.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.926
Just get me my fucking diamonds.

32:38.072 --> 32:39.471
Fuck.

32:41.843 --> 32:43.834
Hey, yo, Reggie, where's G?

32:44.012 --> 32:45.104
Man, you better stay
your little bad ass...

32:45.279 --> 32:46.439
away from my woman.

32:46.614 --> 32:47.876
Man, when are you going to
let her baby-sit me, man?

32:48.049 --> 32:49.448
I been waiting
for two weeks now.

32:49.617 --> 32:50.879
Man, you don't need
a baby-sitter.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.314
You need a parole officer.

32:52.487 --> 32:54.421
You're probably home by yourself
right now, ain't you?

32:54.589 --> 32:56.454
Man, that's what I need
a baby-sitter for, dumb ass.

32:56.624 --> 32:58.353
If it wasn't for you
and puberty...

32:58.526 --> 33:00.585
man, I'd probably be bangin'
that out right now.

33:00.762 --> 33:02.354
Who you calling dumb ass?

33:02.530 --> 33:03.360
Leave me alone, Kelley.

33:03.531 --> 33:04.361
What?

33:04.532 --> 33:06.363
Hey, man.

33:06.534 --> 33:07.899
What are you doing, man?

33:08.069 --> 33:10.094
I'm not gonna have that, man.

33:10.271 --> 33:11.260
Hell, no.

33:11.439 --> 33:12.565
No. Hell, no, man.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.105
Come on, man.
I got shit to do, man.

33:14.275 --> 33:15.207
Man, let me go with you, man.

33:15.376 --> 33:16.365
Don't play me like that.

33:16.544 --> 33:17.636
Man, that's why
I'm not about to tell you...

33:17.812 --> 33:19.973
that some guy came by here
looking for you today.

33:20.148 --> 33:21.979
-Who?
-Him right there.

33:24.886 --> 33:25.716
Damn.

33:25.887 --> 33:27.479
Man, leave him alone,
you rent-a-cop.

33:27.655 --> 33:29.885
Man, you ain't have to do
this shit to me, Bucum, man.

33:30.058 --> 33:31.753
shut up, punk,
before I break your arm.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.223
Man, leave him alone, man.

33:33.394 --> 33:36.158
Get out of here before I
shoot you, you little bastard.

33:36.330 --> 33:38.059
Man, what I do?

33:38.232 --> 33:39.790
You and your buddies
almost shot me today.

33:39.967 --> 33:41.161
I know you was with them.

33:41.335 --> 33:42.495
Aw, wait a minute, Bucum.

33:42.670 --> 33:45.264
You got it all wrong, man.
I wasn't with them cats, man.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.305
-Yeah, you was with them, nigga.
-You know me, Bucum, man.

33:47.475 --> 33:49.238
I ain't never gave you
no problems except for now.

33:49.410 --> 33:51.503
Come on. Let's go.
On your feet.

33:52.747 --> 33:55.147
Look, I accidentally hid
in their van on an accident.

33:55.316 --> 33:57.045
I know I've been full
of shit in the past...

33:57.218 --> 33:59.743
but I'm for real today.
I cannot go to jail.

33:59.921 --> 34:01.980
I got a damn good reason
why I can't go to jail.

34:02.156 --> 34:06.149
You want to know why?
You want to know why, Bucum?

34:06.327 --> 34:07.885
You want to know why
I can't go to jail?

34:08.062 --> 34:09.859
I ain't got no bond money,
for number one.

34:10.031 --> 34:12.966
Number two, they keep giving me
this court-appointed lawyer...

34:13.134 --> 34:17.002
that always send me back to jail
for six, seven, eight months.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.399
Oh, you don't believe me?

34:18.572 --> 34:20.666
You want to know why
I can't go to jail for real?

34:20.842 --> 34:22.536
I just won the lottery
for sixty million.

34:22.710 --> 34:24.405
I'll put that on
everything I love.

34:24.579 --> 34:26.547
I am not bullshitting
with you. I'm for real.

34:26.714 --> 34:29.012
I'm about to get cold cash--
thousands of dollars.

34:29.183 --> 34:32.880
I'm talking about money so tall,
all the bitches wanna fall.

34:34.589 --> 34:37.683
$60 million is how much
the ticket is worth.

34:37.859 --> 34:39.793
Now, I know you could use
a little piece of that...

34:39.960 --> 34:42.156
with this raggedy-ass Impala.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.924
Check it out. All you got
to do is make a small detour...

34:45.099 --> 34:47.431
to take me back
to get my wallet.

34:47.601 --> 34:48.933
That's all I'm asking you.

34:49.103 --> 34:51.036
Look, to make it
real sweet for you...

34:51.205 --> 34:52.536
I can take you back
to show you...

34:52.706 --> 34:56.074
where the diamond robbers
dropped me off at.

34:56.244 --> 34:57.302
Where at?

34:58.780 --> 35:00.975
Just turn on around, pimp.

35:34.649 --> 35:36.310
so, this it?

35:36.484 --> 35:38.281
This is it, man.

35:38.452 --> 35:40.545
This better not be
no bullshit...

35:40.721 --> 35:42.814
because I ain't got no problem
with shooting your ass.

35:42.990 --> 35:46.255
Man, you know we go way back
like a Cadillac with four flats.

35:46.427 --> 35:48.452
Or is it four flats
on a Cadillac?

35:48.629 --> 35:51.962
Like I said, this better
not be no bullshit.

35:52.133 --> 35:53.430
Man...

35:55.870 --> 35:57.360
so, what we going to do?

36:08.049 --> 36:09.380
Get out.

36:11.385 --> 36:12.352
Wait a minute.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.010
Ain't you going to take
the cuffs off of me?

36:14.188 --> 36:16.247
What do you think I look like,
Boo-Boo the fool? Come on.

36:16.424 --> 36:17.823
Man, this ain't how
a real partnership...

36:17.992 --> 36:19.425
is supposed to start.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.188
Maybe because this ain't
no real partnership.

36:22.363 --> 36:24.024
Oh, no, you didn't.

36:24.198 --> 36:25.096
How am I doing?

36:25.266 --> 36:28.235
Come on, come on, move it.
straight up now.

36:28.402 --> 36:30.199
We got to get out to Hollywood.

36:31.539 --> 36:33.769
All right, take her up.

36:52.226 --> 36:53.955
OK. Pull it in.

36:54.128 --> 36:55.789
I told you.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.590
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

37:00.101 --> 37:03.867
I know my wallet
is down there somewhere.

37:07.108 --> 37:08.598
They about to leave.

37:11.145 --> 37:12.874
Let's jump down.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.949
Come on.

37:25.459 --> 37:27.290
How the fuck is I'm supposed
to get down from here?

37:27.461 --> 37:29.326
Jump. I'm going to catch you.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.930
Man, you ain't going
to catch me.

37:31.098 --> 37:33.623
Nigga, you better jump
before I shoot you down.

37:33.801 --> 37:34.893
What you think? You think
I'm going to jump off here...

37:35.069 --> 37:36.502
and end up like
Christopher Reeve?

37:36.671 --> 37:37.899
Nigga, come on.

37:38.072 --> 37:39.300
Bucum, I'm telling you.
I'm going to jump...

37:39.473 --> 37:41.441
but you better not
Let me hurt myself.

37:41.609 --> 37:42.940
Jump! Jump!

37:44.745 --> 37:46.269
Oh, damn.

37:47.915 --> 37:49.314
You all right?

37:49.483 --> 37:51.451
Hell, no, I ain't all right.

37:51.619 --> 37:52.881
Didn't you just see me fall?

37:53.054 --> 37:55.113
Goddamn, I knocked
all the wind out of myself.

37:55.289 --> 37:57.883
Get your ass down.

37:58.059 --> 37:59.424
This shit don't make
no sense, man.

37:59.593 --> 38:01.083
shut up.
Come on.

38:01.262 --> 38:02.559
Police brutality.

38:02.730 --> 38:04.322
I'm going to get Al sharpton.

38:04.498 --> 38:05.556
What the--

38:06.834 --> 38:09.166
I'm telling you, man.
It was right over here, man...

38:09.337 --> 38:10.599
when they chased me.

38:10.771 --> 38:14.002
And then I ran from the van
right over here...

38:14.175 --> 38:16.803
and they shot at me right there.

38:16.978 --> 38:18.878
And you don't
believe me, do you?

38:19.046 --> 38:21.606
Why should I?
Every time I catch you...

38:21.782 --> 38:23.113
you try to lie your way
out of it.

38:23.284 --> 38:25.252
Look, Bucum,
I can't go to jail, man.

38:25.419 --> 38:27.410
They're going to pin that
diamond shit on me, man.

38:27.588 --> 38:29.317
It sound like
a personal problem to me.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.253
I can't go to jail.
Look how skinny I am.

38:31.425 --> 38:32.357
They're going to be
bidding on my ass...

38:32.526 --> 38:34.084
like I was in a car
auction or something.

38:34.261 --> 38:36.821
25, 35, 75, 45, 55, 35--

38:36.998 --> 38:38.295
sold to the man
with braids in his hair.

38:38.466 --> 38:39.455
You know what?

38:42.370 --> 38:44.338
I ain't going to take you
to jail just yet...

38:44.505 --> 38:46.769
because I want the motherfuckers
that shot at me...

38:46.941 --> 38:48.738
and I know you know
more than what you saying.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.501
Yes, you do, nigga.
shut up.

38:50.678 --> 38:53.374
so, if they got your wallet
like you say they do...

38:53.547 --> 38:55.276
they'll be coming
to look for you soon.

38:55.449 --> 38:56.746
That's when their ass is mine.
Come on.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.784
-You'll see if I'm right.
-shut up.

39:04.225 --> 39:05.453
Bail bonds.

39:05.626 --> 39:07.856
That's not how you supposed
to answer the phone.

39:08.029 --> 39:09.826
Is that how your mama taught
you to answer the phone?

39:09.997 --> 39:11.055
What you need? I'm trying
to get out of here.

39:11.232 --> 39:15.066
OK. Did Captain Briggs
call Martinez tonight?

39:15.236 --> 39:17.033
I heard you almost
got shot again.

39:17.204 --> 39:19.172
Why don't you put a sister on
and let me get your back?

39:19.340 --> 39:22.537
I keep telling you.
I'm going to keep you in mind.

39:22.710 --> 39:24.234
I know.
You keep telling me that.

39:24.412 --> 39:26.312
OK, then believe me.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.380
What'd they talk about?

39:30.351 --> 39:32.376
They were only on the phone
for about ten minutes.

39:32.553 --> 39:34.578
Miami P D. ain't got nothing.

39:34.755 --> 39:36.655
They said that building
was supposed to be closed.

39:36.824 --> 39:39.190
They were planning for
some party tomorrow night.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.827
And there were
no security cameras...

39:40.995 --> 39:43.190
so they think it was
an inside job.

39:43.364 --> 39:44.729
But Barkley's got
so many clients...

39:44.899 --> 39:46.992
they think it might take
a while to contact them all.

39:48.569 --> 39:50.469
-What else they talk about?
-That's all.

39:50.638 --> 39:51.468
That's it?

39:51.639 --> 39:52.469
That's it.
I would tell you.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.698
Who are you talking to?

39:53.874 --> 39:55.239
Nobody.

39:55.409 --> 39:57.809
You know I can get fired for
listening to his phone calls.

39:57.978 --> 40:00.469
Oh, don't worry about
Moon Roof Martinez.

40:00.648 --> 40:01.637
shit. He ain't going
to do nothing.

40:01.816 --> 40:02.714
Hey, if he fires you...

40:02.883 --> 40:05.249
you can always work for me
at the P I. firm.

40:05.419 --> 40:09.082
Nigga, you ain't got
no P I. firm.

40:09.256 --> 40:11.156
You as broke as I am.

40:40.488 --> 40:44.652
What kind of plan calls for us
to be handcuffed to my bed?

40:44.825 --> 40:46.918
Listen, baby, we got
to listen to Bucum...

40:47.094 --> 40:49.153
or he going to take
my black ass to jail.

40:49.330 --> 40:50.729
This shit's got to be illegal.

40:50.898 --> 40:54.390
I'm not the fugitive here,
so why am I being held?

40:54.568 --> 40:55.899
Because you an accessory.

40:56.070 --> 40:58.163
You harboring a fugitive
if I'm your man.

40:58.339 --> 40:59.966
They going to take you
to jail for that shit, too.

41:00.141 --> 41:01.403
Oh, shit.

41:01.575 --> 41:02.872
Reggie, how many times
did I tell you, baby...

41:03.043 --> 41:06.069
"Go to court"?
"Baby, please go to court."

41:06.247 --> 41:07.077
Come on.

41:07.248 --> 41:08.738
You told me a lot.
Exactly.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.975
But I'm allergic
to the judicial system...

41:11.152 --> 41:12.619
and every time
I see them court rooms...

41:12.786 --> 41:14.219
I break out in hives, baby.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.650
You know what I'm saying?
I get to sweatin'--

41:15.823 --> 41:17.256
When I watch "Judge Judy"...

41:17.424 --> 41:19.255
I get to sweatin'
and scratchin' and shit.

41:21.662 --> 41:24.495
Look, baby, I know
these cuffs is fucked up.

41:24.665 --> 41:28.066
Look, baby, don't be mad at me.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.328
Don't be mad at me.

41:32.540 --> 41:34.474
What was that?

41:34.642 --> 41:36.007
I don't know.

41:36.177 --> 41:37.508
What are we supposed to do?

41:39.246 --> 41:41.111
Play dead, baby.

41:41.282 --> 41:43.113
-Play dead?
-Play dead.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.311
-That shit doesn't work.
-It do work.

41:48.489 --> 41:50.150
Baby, that's bullshit.
I'm not--

41:57.831 --> 42:00.095
Wow, that's kinky.

42:00.267 --> 42:02.895
Hey, Reginald.

42:03.070 --> 42:05.561
Roach around the collar

42:06.607 --> 42:08.234
Come on, man.

42:08.409 --> 42:09.740
Baby, I told you
it wouldn't work.

42:09.910 --> 42:12.208
Damn. I thought somebody
beat me to the punch.

42:12.379 --> 42:13.846
They did.

42:15.249 --> 42:17.217
What took you so fucking long?

42:17.384 --> 42:18.851
Can you uncuff us, please?

42:19.019 --> 42:21.180
Look in his pocket to see
if my wallet's in there.

42:23.857 --> 42:25.017
That's an ugly picture of you.

42:25.192 --> 42:26.318
Now you believe me,
though, huh?

42:26.493 --> 42:27.983
I believe you about
the wallet thing...

42:28.162 --> 42:29.254
but the lotto...

42:29.430 --> 42:30.863
you missed me with that shit.

42:31.031 --> 42:31.998
That's more money
for me and my girl.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.224
Yeah, that's right.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.662
Can you uncuff us now, please?

42:34.835 --> 42:35.961
I'll think about it.

42:36.136 --> 42:38.604
Y'all got a screwdriver
around this motherfucker?

42:39.039 --> 42:41.098
I ought to kick
your motherfucking ass.

42:41.275 --> 42:43.368
With that big-ass head.
Look at your hairline.

42:43.544 --> 42:45.375
You'll never find

42:47.448 --> 42:50.042
A hairline like mine

42:51.552 --> 42:53.417
Your shit is way back here.
If you was in the army...

42:53.587 --> 42:55.987
you'd have to salute like this--
"Yes, sir."

42:56.156 --> 42:57.714
Your shit is fucked up.

42:57.891 --> 42:59.882
You ain't got a forehead.
You got a five-head.

43:00.060 --> 43:00.890
Really?

43:01.061 --> 43:02.085
-Really.
-You think so?

43:02.263 --> 43:03.958
I bet when you have dreams
you don't have dreams.

43:04.131 --> 43:05.564
You have movies.

43:07.167 --> 43:07.997
Reggie, where is it?

43:08.168 --> 43:09.863
It's up under the sink, baby.

43:11.105 --> 43:12.766
see, that's pussy
talking to me right there--

43:12.940 --> 43:15.170
something you might not
never know nothing about.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.139
You know what?
I'm really scared of you.

43:17.311 --> 43:18.278
Yeah. You going to be scared...

43:18.445 --> 43:19.605
when I snatch
that leather wig...

43:19.780 --> 43:22.510
off your motherfucking head
and them suede sideburns.

43:22.683 --> 43:23.911
I'm shivering.

43:24.084 --> 43:25.278
We going to fuck you up.
Keep talking.

43:25.452 --> 43:26.612
I'm shitting in my pants.

43:26.787 --> 43:28.687
Keep talking, motherfucker!
say something--

43:28.856 --> 43:30.016
I'm pissing in my boots.

43:30.190 --> 43:31.851
I wouldn't even have did your
motherfucking arm like that.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.721
I would've fucking took
your motherfucking ass...

43:33.894 --> 43:35.054
and buried you in the ground...

43:35.229 --> 43:36.719
and put a water hose
in your mouth...

43:36.897 --> 43:39.593
and duct tape it all around
and turn it on full blast...

43:39.767 --> 43:41.792
and blow your motherfucking
stomach up.

43:41.969 --> 43:43.937
Bitch.

43:44.104 --> 43:45.935
Take five.

43:55.482 --> 43:57.973
You're the one
that shot at me, huh?

43:58.152 --> 44:00.017
Yeah, it was you.

44:00.187 --> 44:01.916
It was you.

44:03.257 --> 44:04.246
What happened to your hand?

44:05.926 --> 44:07.359
What? I can't hear you.
What'd you say?

44:07.528 --> 44:09.120
Huh? What was that?
I didn't hear you.

44:10.297 --> 44:12.356
You know what?

44:12.533 --> 44:14.433
I only got one question.

44:14.601 --> 44:16.660
Who sent you over here
to kill Reggie?

44:16.837 --> 44:18.099
Yeah. Where the fuck
is my wallet at?

44:18.272 --> 44:19.170
That's what I'm asking.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.831
Where the fuck's the wallet,
huh? The wallet.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.875
Relax, relax, OK
I got this.

44:26.046 --> 44:27.274
All right. shit.
All right. sorry.

44:31.785 --> 44:34.583
You know, I don't think that
you want to know what I know.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.017
I don't think
that you want to know...

44:36.190 --> 44:37.521
who you're really fucking with.

44:37.691 --> 44:39.522
Are you screwing with me? Huh?

44:39.693 --> 44:41.251
You screwing with me?
Trying to fuck with my head?

44:41.428 --> 44:43.123

45:12.559 --> 45:15.494
Fuck you, you Little Richard

45:15.662 --> 45:16.492
He ain't going to say--

45:16.663 --> 45:17.789
Hold on, hold on.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.263
That's right. You look like
Little Richard, you bitch.

45:20.434 --> 45:22.026
You bitch.

46:57.130 --> 46:59.291
All he does is handcuff

46:59.466 --> 47:01.627
Quiet down, Gina.

47:30.397 --> 47:31.227
He was supposed to call me
when he'd finished.

47:31.398 --> 47:32.365
Call him again.

47:32.533 --> 47:35.058
You only have two days
to find the real stones.

47:35.235 --> 47:36.896
How about I go over

48:32.159 --> 48:33.319
$6,000?

48:33.493 --> 48:34.858
six grand.

48:36.730 --> 48:38.789
You know what?
If you had $6 million...

48:38.966 --> 48:40.797
you still couldn't
afford this boat.

48:40.968 --> 48:42.902
You know what I'm sayin'?

48:43.070 --> 48:44.469
Wait a minute, dog.

48:44.638 --> 48:46.401
You don't even know me

49:02.789 --> 49:04.120
That's called the door.

49:04.291 --> 49:07.089
Use it. Bye-bye.

49:07.260 --> 49:08.284
Hey! Wait a minute, homey!

49:08.462 --> 49:10.430
-Hey, ho--wait a minute.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.311
What if we never
find this wallet?

49:25.479 --> 49:27.640
Come on, don't say that now.

49:27.814 --> 49:29.281
Look, go over on that side
of the parking lot...

49:29.449 --> 49:30.473

49:30.651 --> 49:32.050
OK, baby? Go over there

49:34.688 --> 49:36.315

49:54.841 --> 49:56.536
Oh, man, handcuffs are easy!

49:56.710 --> 49:57.540
I'm a criminal.

49:57.711 --> 49:58.905

49:59.079 --> 50:00.410
Come on. I seen

I gotta get my wallet first.

50:03.583 --> 50:06.017
Forget about
that damn wallet, OK

50:06.186 --> 50:07.175
I seen his face.

50:07.354 --> 50:08.844
We need to go over there
and get in position...

50:09.022 --> 50:09.920
wait for him to lead us
to the diamonds.

50:10.090 --> 50:11.182
Come on, let's go!

50:11.358 --> 50:12.518
I don't give a fuck
about them diamonds!

50:12.693 --> 50:14.524
I'm not leaving here
until I find my wallet!

50:14.695 --> 50:16.560
You still on this wallet shit.

50:16.730 --> 50:18.163
Look, listen! I don't
believe that wallet.

50:18.331 --> 50:19.958
I don't believe the lotto.

50:20.133 --> 50:21.896
You won the lotto today?
Come on, man, please!

50:22.069 --> 50:22.899
You don't believe--

50:23.070 --> 50:24.765
LI.G. it, man.
Let it go, Reggie.

50:24.938 --> 50:25.996
Let it go!

50:26.173 --> 50:27.003
You don't believe me?

50:27.174 --> 50:28.869
Hell, no.

50:29.042 --> 50:30.634
I'm not leavin' this
motherfuckin' parking lot...

50:30.811 --> 50:32.438
till I find my wallet.

50:32.612 --> 50:35.240
Them motherfuckers
tried to kill you today.

50:35.415 --> 50:36.780
so what? Let 'em
come on out here!

50:36.950 --> 50:38.679
I've been lookin' for them, and
they've been lookin' for me...

50:38.852 --> 50:40.149
and God damn it,
we can meet right here...

50:40.320 --> 50:41.344
on the motherfuckin' concrete...

50:41.521 --> 50:42.783
and scrap like a motherfucker
right now!

50:42.956 --> 50:44.617
Come on. You crazy.

50:44.791 --> 50:47.521
Man, you cra--what, man?
How am I crazy? I'm crazy?

50:47.694 --> 50:49.992
$60 million worth of
motherfuckin' lotto tickets...

50:50.163 --> 50:54.099
and I'm crazy?! Nigga,
I'm insane, nigga! Let me--

50:55.102 --> 50:56.865
Fuckin' door!
Fuck this shit!

50:57.037 --> 50:58.732
Come on!
Get off of me, man!

50:58.905 --> 51:00.896
Look, I ain't got no goddamn
time to play with you!

51:02.509 --> 51:04.443
You almost hit me,
motherfucker!

51:04.611 --> 51:06.272
Hey, what the hell
wrong with you, Reggie?

51:06.446 --> 51:07.913
What the hell
wrong with you?

51:08.081 --> 51:09.139
Baby, you can't fight.
Just let it go.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.908
so what?

51:14.488 --> 51:15.887
Look at this.

51:16.056 --> 51:17.717
That's our stowaway...

51:17.891 --> 51:19.654
and that's the guy
we shot at this morning.

51:20.761 --> 51:21.921
Oh, Bucum, let him go.

51:22.095 --> 51:22.993
You shut up.
Calm down.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.494
Let my head go, nigga.

51:24.664 --> 51:26.723
Calm down.
You calm?

51:26.900 --> 51:28.424
Ah, shit! Ah!

51:28.602 --> 51:30.797
so while we've been
looking for them...

51:30.971 --> 51:31.801
they're looking for us.

51:31.972 --> 51:32.870
I swear to God!

51:33.039 --> 51:34.802
You bite me on my nipple
again, I'll kill--

51:36.243 --> 51:37.232
Kiss her.

51:37.410 --> 51:38.308
-Ki--
-What?

51:38.478 --> 51:40.105
Kiss her!

51:44.785 --> 51:45.843
Lemme go handle this situation.

51:46.019 --> 51:47.213
Hold on a minute.

51:49.289 --> 51:51.120
Hey, officer.

51:51.291 --> 51:53.384
It's puppy love.

51:53.560 --> 51:55.152
You got a condom?

51:58.365 --> 52:00.458
You know what I think?

52:00.634 --> 52:01.692
I don't care what
you think. Come on.

52:01.868 --> 52:03.563
I think you ain't supposed
to be fuckin' with us.

52:03.737 --> 52:04.897
That's what I'm
thinkin' right now.

52:05.071 --> 52:06.936
That was some
strange shit right there.

52:07.107 --> 52:08.404
Real strange! Come on, baby.

52:08.575 --> 52:09.769
Wasn't nothin'
strange about that.

52:09.943 --> 52:11.808
I just didn't want the cops
to take you from me, that's all.

52:11.978 --> 52:13.411
Yeah, right.
Where you take me?

52:13.580 --> 52:14.740
Come on.
I'm ready to go to jail.

52:14.915 --> 52:16.348
You know I go to
jail all the time.

52:16.516 --> 52:17.414
It ain't no thing.

52:17.584 --> 52:18.676
Take me to jail so
I can go out and get...

52:18.852 --> 52:20.786
my commissary and do
my motherfuckin' thing.

52:20.954 --> 52:22.251
Don't you tempt me.

52:22.422 --> 52:25.323
'Cause how I feel
right now, you might.

52:25.492 --> 52:27.016
You motherfucker!

52:27.194 --> 52:28.422
Well, let's go
to jail right now!

52:28.595 --> 52:29.892
I'm ready to go to jail...

52:30.063 --> 52:31.690
'cause you think I'm lyin'
about that lotto ticket...

52:31.865 --> 52:33.162
and I think you lyin'
about everything...

52:33.333 --> 52:34.163
you know what I'm sayin'?!

52:34.334 --> 52:35.596
Reggie.
Reggie, enough.

52:36.770 --> 52:39.864
Listen to your woman,
'cause you this close!

52:40.040 --> 52:42.372
You this close from goin'!

52:42.542 --> 52:44.874
What we gonna do
is sit right here...

52:45.045 --> 52:46.410
and wait for Williamson
to come out...

52:46.580 --> 52:48.980
and lead us to
them goddamn diamonds!

52:49.149 --> 52:52.243
He can't lead us to
nothin' he don't have.

52:52.419 --> 52:55.820
What?! What the hell
are you talkin' about?

52:55.989 --> 52:58.822
He don't know where the
diamonds are, either, Matlock.

52:58.992 --> 53:00.323
How you know?

53:00.493 --> 53:02.518
'Cause I know everything, pimpy.

53:02.696 --> 53:04.061
I'm real smart.

53:04.231 --> 53:05.323
Remember that dude
that got killed...

53:05.498 --> 53:06.556
over at the diamond heist?

53:06.733 --> 53:08.598
-Mr. Barkley?
-Right.

53:08.768 --> 53:11.362
Him and Williamson had some
kind of inside shit goin' on.

53:11.538 --> 53:13.165
Obviously, he didn't
trust Williamson...

53:13.340 --> 53:15.331
so instead of him givin' him
a case full of diamonds...

53:15.508 --> 53:16.839
this dirty motherfucker
gave him a case...

53:17.010 --> 53:19.274
full of glass with
a note attached to it.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.914
Talkin' about the diamonds
was in a real safe place.

53:22.082 --> 53:24.209
Why the fuck you didn't
tell me this two hours ago?

53:24.384 --> 53:25.817
'Cause I ain't give a fuck
about them diamonds.

53:25.986 --> 53:28.216
All I'm lookin' for in my
life is that lotto ticket.

53:28.388 --> 53:30.288
Our lotto ticket.

53:30.457 --> 53:31.685
Our lotto ticket.

53:53.546 --> 53:54.877
Make yourself at home.

53:55.048 --> 53:56.640
Hey, can I at least...

53:56.816 --> 53:58.943
take a shower or
a bath or somethin'?

53:59.119 --> 54:01.053
Yeah. The bathroom
is through there.

54:01.221 --> 54:02.483
Towels are in the cabinet.

54:02.656 --> 54:04.453
Thanks.

54:07.994 --> 54:10.258
This is a nice place, dude.

54:10.430 --> 54:11.624
Thank you.

54:11.798 --> 54:12.787
so, this make us partners,
right?

54:12.966 --> 54:15.400
What makes you say some
dumb shit like that?

54:15.568 --> 54:17.593
Because you ain't never
brought me to your house.

54:17.771 --> 54:18.897
It's either you
can't turn me in...

54:19.072 --> 54:21.233
or you won't turn me in.

54:21.408 --> 54:23.638
You tryin' to get them diamonds
for yourself, ain't you?

54:23.810 --> 54:24.640
Hell, no.

54:24.811 --> 54:26.073
You know what I'm after.

54:26.246 --> 54:28.874
I still don't know what
you want out this thing.

54:29.049 --> 54:30.812
I just wanna solve the case...

54:30.984 --> 54:32.747
before the Miami P D. do,
that's all.

54:32.919 --> 54:35.080
That's bullshit.
I know that Miami P D...

54:35.255 --> 54:37.450
and them bounty hunters
don't get along.

54:40.393 --> 54:41.587
I ain't gonna
tell you no more...

54:41.761 --> 54:44.491
until you tell me
what I wanna know.

54:44.664 --> 54:47.064
I'm about to catch
a severe case of amnesia...

54:47.233 --> 54:50.396
up in this motherfuckin'
piece right now.

54:51.771 --> 54:53.932
All right.

54:54.107 --> 54:56.632
I'm tryin' to get out
the bounty hunting business.

54:56.810 --> 54:58.505
It's a bullshit racket.

54:58.678 --> 54:59.838
Now, what I really want to do...

55:00.013 --> 55:02.311
is open my own
private investigation firm...

55:02.482 --> 55:04.848
'cause that's where
the money is. At first...

55:05.018 --> 55:07.043
I just wanted to catch the
motherfuckers that shot at me...

55:07.220 --> 55:10.280
but now I think
I can solve this case...

55:10.457 --> 55:13.517
and if I do it before
the Miami police do it...

55:13.693 --> 55:16.321
that publicity right there'd
be everything I need...

55:16.496 --> 55:18.430
to get my business
off the ground.

55:18.598 --> 55:20.259
so, that's what I want.

55:20.433 --> 55:21.866
so you're tryin'
to get the diamonds...

55:22.035 --> 55:23.024
so you can turn 'em back in.

55:24.504 --> 55:26.802
That's harder to believe than
my ticket story, asshole.

55:26.973 --> 55:28.372
At least it's the truth!

55:28.541 --> 55:29.530
Fuck you, Bucum.
You think I'd be goin'...

55:29.709 --> 55:31.370
through all this trouble
just to keep a lie goin'?

55:31.544 --> 55:33.273
Yeah, 'cause you
a lyin' son of a bitch...

55:33.446 --> 55:35.880
you a con man, and you always
tryin' to get over on people.

55:36.049 --> 55:37.482
What about you?
You tryin' to get over...

55:37.650 --> 55:40.312
on people, too--
just in a different way.

55:41.488 --> 55:43.115
Let me tell you
somethin', man...

55:43.289 --> 55:44.347
you know, just in case
you don't know...

55:44.524 --> 55:47.357
I've been on my own since I was
fourteen years old.

55:47.527 --> 55:48.892
Everything I done
got off the street...

55:49.062 --> 55:51.053
I got it on my own.

55:51.231 --> 55:53.131
What's your story?
Why are you so selfish?

55:54.601 --> 55:57.331
That ain't none
of your business.

56:00.874 --> 56:03.274
Oh, it ain't none
of my business, huh?

56:03.443 --> 56:06.105
Hold up, hold up.
Now who's the con man?

56:06.279 --> 56:08.144
At least you know
what I'm all about.

56:08.314 --> 56:09.303
I ain't got nothin' to hide.

56:09.482 --> 56:10.642
What you all about?

56:10.817 --> 56:11.977
I'm all about the business.

56:12.152 --> 56:13.119
What you think?

56:13.286 --> 56:14.878
Why you don't trust nobody, man?

56:15.055 --> 56:15.885
Man, look, look, look.

56:16.056 --> 56:17.216
OK, let's just
change the subject...

56:17.390 --> 56:18.721
'cause you kind of sound
like a female...

56:18.892 --> 56:20.291
with all this
inner-feeling shit.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.757
Just let me know everything...

56:21.928 --> 56:23.919
you know about
that diamond robbery.

56:24.097 --> 56:25.121
Naw, I don't think
I know nothin'...

56:25.298 --> 56:27.960
about no diamond robbery,
since we ain't partners.

56:39.612 --> 56:41.842
I didn't--what did I hear?

56:42.015 --> 56:42.947
Did I hear anything?

56:43.116 --> 56:46.142
-I said, "OK."
-OK, what?

56:46.319 --> 56:49.618
OK, we partners...
but I'm the boss.

56:49.789 --> 56:52.223
OK, partner.
I mean, boss.

56:52.392 --> 56:54.292
You the boss.

56:54.461 --> 56:56.019
so, what's the plan?

56:57.263 --> 56:59.595
I think we gotta go
to Mrs. Barkley.

56:59.766 --> 57:02.963
Go over they house,
see what she know.

57:03.136 --> 57:04.569
I don't like that plan.

57:04.737 --> 57:07.137
so what? You ain't
the boss. I am.

57:07.307 --> 57:09.070
-But I'm the capo.
-You ain't--

57:09.242 --> 57:12.302
-The boss next to the boss.
-You ain't shit...

57:12.479 --> 57:15.676
and I should slap your ass
for bitin' me on my nipple...

57:15.849 --> 57:17.976
anyway.

57:18.151 --> 57:20.449
I had to bite you 'cause you
had me in a headlock...

57:20.620 --> 57:23.248
with my woman standin' there.

57:23.423 --> 57:25.721
No--you--I'm not gonna
let you kick my ass...

57:25.892 --> 57:28.258
in front of my girl,
and then, when I get home...

57:28.428 --> 57:30.328
she be tellin', "Why you
ain't do Bucum like that?"

57:30.497 --> 57:31.930
I'm gonna take
your ass to court...

57:32.098 --> 57:35.329
for involuntary manslaughter...

57:35.502 --> 57:39.563
battery against
a Jehovah's Witness...

57:39.739 --> 57:40.797
Bucum !

57:41.040 --> 57:43.201
That's a nice crib!

57:43.376 --> 57:45.310
Yeah, it's tight.

57:45.478 --> 57:48.106
I'm gonna get one of these
when I get my money.

57:52.252 --> 57:54.812
Wait a minute.
Back in the car.

57:54.988 --> 57:56.717
Why I always gotta
wait in the car?

57:56.890 --> 57:58.687
Look, I don't wanna
scare this white lady...

57:58.858 --> 58:01.156
with two niggas knockin' on her
door at 7::30 in the mornin'.

58:01.327 --> 58:02.624
she might not open it.

58:02.795 --> 58:04.023
Well, leave me a gun
out here, pimpy.

58:04.197 --> 58:05.960
Get your ass
back in the car, pimpy.

58:06.132 --> 58:09.624
You're lucky I don't tie you
back to the steering wheel.

58:21.714 --> 58:23.773
Hello?

58:24.817 --> 58:27.411
Excuse me, Mrs. Barkley?

58:58.051 --> 59:00.918
This is a bad motherfucker!

59:03.723 --> 59:05.554
sub-zero.

59:06.559 --> 59:07.787
Oh, this is a bad mother--!

59:07.961 --> 59:09.986
Make mine feel like a president!

59:10.163 --> 59:11.960
First black president!

59:53.840 --> 59:56.274
Now, let's go outside
and take care of your friend.

59:57.910 --> 59:59.537
Take care of that,
motherfucker!

01:00:04.584 --> 01:00:07.519
I thought I told you to keep
your dumb ass in the car.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:08.779
You know what?
I had a feeling...

01:00:08.955 --> 01:00:09.922
you was gettin'
your ass kicked in here...

01:00:10.089 --> 01:00:11.113
and you was.

01:00:11.291 --> 01:00:12.451
Get the key
out of my pocket, man.

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:13.751
say "thank you" or somethin'.

01:00:13.926 --> 01:00:15.086
Oh, I'm gonna let you go.

01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:16.125
Ow! shit, man.

01:00:16.296 --> 01:00:17.126
Hold up, man.

01:00:17.297 --> 01:00:18.457
Is you retarded or somethin'?

01:00:18.631 --> 01:00:20.098
Naw, I'm just not the police.

01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:22.757
You gotta be a police
to be able to do this shit.

01:00:22.935 --> 01:00:24.596
The punk-ass police.

01:00:27.307 --> 01:00:28.797
Bastard.

01:00:30.076 --> 01:00:31.168
see if you can find
Mrs. Barkley.

01:00:31.344 --> 01:00:32.868
We fucked him up, man.

01:00:36.249 --> 01:00:37.113
And don't touch nothin'.

01:00:37.283 --> 01:00:39.114
Ain't nobody gonna touch shit.

01:00:40.453 --> 01:00:41.715
Punk-ass mini-me.

01:01:06.512 --> 01:01:08.002
shit.

01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:09.614
shit, hold up.

01:01:28.201 --> 01:01:29.930
Got a pretty good
swing there, golf boy.

01:01:31.471 --> 01:01:33.439
I wonder what's your handicap?

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:04.933
I'm gonna rip
your fuckin' arm off...

01:02:05.104 --> 01:02:07.436
and beat you to death
with it, you cocksucker!

01:02:07.607 --> 01:02:08.596
Is that right?

01:02:10.676 --> 01:02:12.234
Hold that thought, player.

01:02:13.546 --> 01:02:15.070
What the hell you
keep yelling for?

01:02:15.248 --> 01:02:17.546
This bitch just scared
the shit out of me!

01:02:17.717 --> 01:02:20.151
I'll be goddamned.

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.684
This is Mrs. Barkley's will
right here, man.

01:02:21.854 --> 01:02:23.583
I told you not to touch nothin'.

01:02:23.756 --> 01:02:25.246
But I--

01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:27.917
It look like he left her
everything.

01:02:28.094 --> 01:02:29.891
I know, but I'm trying
to buy this crib.

01:02:30.062 --> 01:02:31.086
I know they gonna sell it.

01:02:31.264 --> 01:02:32.595
What's in the safe?

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:35.861
Nothin'.

01:02:39.405 --> 01:02:41.305
He said the diamonds was
in a nice, safe place.

01:02:41.474 --> 01:02:43.567
Now, what's safer than a safe?

01:02:43.743 --> 01:02:45.301
Come on, Bucum, look.
Listen, man.

01:02:45.478 --> 01:02:46.843
Don't you think they
smart enough to get...

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.243
the fuckin' diamonds outta there
before we got here?

01:02:49.415 --> 01:02:51.440
Yeah, as a matter of
fact, they would, huh?

01:02:51.617 --> 01:02:52.447
-Right.
-Come here, asshole.

01:02:52.618 --> 01:02:53.448
In fact, let me check you.

01:02:53.619 --> 01:02:54.745
Come on, man!

01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:57.219
sorry, Puffy,
but we're talkin' about...

01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:59.517
$20 million
worth of diamonds.

01:02:59.692 --> 01:03:02.593
And even an honest man
Like yourself could get tempted.

01:03:02.762 --> 01:03:04.252
You know what?

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:06.330
You can trust me.
That's what it is.

01:03:06.499 --> 01:03:07.796
You can trust me.
What the fuck I want...

01:03:07.967 --> 01:03:10.265
with $20 million worth
of motherfuckin' diamonds?

01:03:10.436 --> 01:03:12.529
Trust me, man!
We together--

01:03:12.705 --> 01:03:15.731
Oh, this a whole lot
of trust right here.

01:03:15.908 --> 01:03:17.341
I know what you thinkin'.

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:19.410
I was just about to
put that back in there.

01:03:19.579 --> 01:03:20.409
You scandalous.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.070
How you gonna steal
from a dead woman?

01:03:22.248 --> 01:03:23.613
'Cause she ain't
complainin' about it.

01:03:23.783 --> 01:03:25.444
she don't give a fuck.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:34.049
Hey, Bucum, we can split it!

01:03:40.933 --> 01:03:42.230
We got a friend
for you, partner.

01:03:46.606 --> 01:03:48.233
What's next, man?

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:51.001
We go in here and wipe down
everything we touched.

01:03:55.548 --> 01:03:57.106
Reggie!

01:03:57.283 --> 01:03:59.683
Whatcha doin' walkin' around
these people house, man?

01:03:59.852 --> 01:04:01.752
Hey, you know they got
a sub-zero refrigerator in here?

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.616
Get your ass back
over here and help me.

01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:05.723
Drinkin' orange juice and shit.

01:04:05.892 --> 01:04:08.053
Don't you know we got a dead
white woman upstairs, man?

01:04:08.227 --> 01:04:10.661
You better hurry up
and clean this shit up, huh?

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:13.390
Give me something
to clean with, man.

01:04:13.566 --> 01:04:14.464
shit.

01:04:14.634 --> 01:04:15.498
And hurry up.

01:04:15.668 --> 01:04:17.932
Nigga's a fuckin' joke.

01:04:23.175 --> 01:04:24.836
Oh, shit. Look at this.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.608
Damn, we gotta get that.

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:35.481
I know.

01:04:35.655 --> 01:04:38.419
Why don't you stick your hand
in there and grab it?

01:04:38.591 --> 01:04:41.151
see? You know,
you're tryin' to be funny.

01:04:41.327 --> 01:04:42.954
That's like askin' me
to stick my tongue...

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.188
in Oprah Winfrey's ass.

01:04:45.364 --> 01:04:48.333
I'm not fuckin'
stickin' my hand in there.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.332
Oh, shit.

01:04:57.977 --> 01:04:59.205
Watch out.

01:05:06.018 --> 01:05:06.985
Damn.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:08.711
Yo, what's that up under
that gun right there?

01:05:08.888 --> 01:05:10.048
Look. You see it?

01:05:14.026 --> 01:05:15.857
Right there. Grab it.

01:05:32.578 --> 01:05:34.512
Oh, my God.

01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:44.817
Oh, yeah.

01:05:44.991 --> 01:05:46.822
said they was
in a nice, safe place...

01:05:46.993 --> 01:05:48.290
but bling-bling.

01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:49.723
Goddamn!

01:05:49.895 --> 01:05:52.261
They sweet!

01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:53.921
You know what?
Let me go and get my two...

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.362
for all my pain and suffering.

01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:56.694
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:57.836
Put 'em back.

01:05:58.004 --> 01:06:00.302
I'm gettin' earrings
Like Allen Iverson, fool.

01:06:00.473 --> 01:06:01.440
Put 'em back.

01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:04.075
Man, take your little
stank-ass diamonds, man.

01:06:04.243 --> 01:06:05.801
Let's go. Come on.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:15.217
I haven't thought about...

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.480
what I'm gonna do
with the diamonds yet.

01:06:16.656 --> 01:06:18.055
I know what I said last night.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.248
-You know what I mean?
-Right.

01:06:19.425 --> 01:06:21.256
But, shit, when you get 'em
in your hand, you know.

01:06:21.427 --> 01:06:23.224
-I know.
-You know, things change.

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:25.057
I know, but I--
I was just thinkin'...

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.597
I was gonna at least get,
you know what I'm sayin'...

01:06:27.767 --> 01:06:29.325
at least two of 'em, though...

01:06:29.502 --> 01:06:30.662
because of,
you know what I'm sayin'...

01:06:30.836 --> 01:06:32.326
all the shit
that I went through.

01:06:32.505 --> 01:06:35.030
Yeah, you want some
Allen Iverson earrings.

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:37.873
-Not with these, player.
-Aw, man.

01:06:38.044 --> 01:06:39.739
I mean, you'll look like
a damn fool...

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:42.904
with a earrings this big
hangin' out your ear, man.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:44.413
But you don't know
how much pussy I can get...

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:48.713
off just a side shot of my face
like this in a club.

01:06:49.855 --> 01:06:50.879
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:06:51.057 --> 01:06:53.890
Bitch be like, "Bling, ooh!"

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.925
Reggie Wright, man...

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:56.925
you all right.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.222
Cool, man.

01:06:58.397 --> 01:06:59.295
You all right.

01:06:59.465 --> 01:07:01.296
I try to be, man.
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:10.839
Hey, go upstairs and get Gina...

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:12.238
so we can drop
these dicks off...

01:07:12.411 --> 01:07:13.708
in the Everglades somewhere.

01:07:13.879 --> 01:07:15.813
I got you, dog.
I'll be back.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.454
That's cold, baby.

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:31.755
That ice is cold, baby.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:37.765
so that's what
$20 million feel like, huh?

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.371
Where you at, baby?

01:07:45.711 --> 01:07:47.372
What's this right here?

01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:51.108
"If you want the girl
back in one piece..."

01:07:57.456 --> 01:07:59.014
They got her, dog.
They got her.

01:07:59.191 --> 01:08:00.021
What?

01:08:00.192 --> 01:08:01.022
Williamson got Gina, man.

01:08:01.193 --> 01:08:02.387
Bullshit!

01:08:02.561 --> 01:08:05.359
Man, I can't handle this, man!

01:08:05.531 --> 01:08:06.725
Damn!

01:08:06.899 --> 01:08:08.833
How these motherfuckers
get in my house?

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:10.366
What we gonna do, man?

01:08:10.536 --> 01:08:11.764
Hey, they want you for her.

01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:13.029
How did they find us?

01:08:13.205 --> 01:08:14.035
That fight!

01:08:14.206 --> 01:08:15.730
The parking lot, remember?

01:08:15.908 --> 01:08:17.899
I told you to keep
your dumb ass in the car!

01:08:18.077 --> 01:08:20.102
No, your ass shouldn't have
went in there talkin' to 'em !

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:21.746
Why is it always my fault,
Bucum?

01:08:21.913 --> 01:08:23.176
You know what?

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.078
Give me the keys.
I'm about to kill...

01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:26.183
these two motherfuckers
in the trunk!

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:27.876
Give me the keys!

01:08:28.053 --> 01:08:29.111
Wait a minute!
Wait, wait!

01:08:29.287 --> 01:08:31.518
Hey, hey! stop it!

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:36.255
They're gonna kill us!

01:08:37.263 --> 01:08:38.992
-Damn!
-Calm down!

01:08:39.165 --> 01:08:40.393
Don't go off
the deep end, man.

01:08:40.566 --> 01:08:41.794
We just gotta think
of the right plan...

01:08:41.966 --> 01:08:42.796
to get her back.

01:08:42.968 --> 01:08:45.993
Goin' in that trunk
ain't gonna do shit!

01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:48.935
Look, Bucum, I swear, man,
if somethin' happen to Gina...

01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:50.871
I'm gonna lose it.

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:51.872
You ain't gonna lose it, man.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:52.874
We gonna get her.

01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:54.136
This girl been

01:08:54.313 --> 01:08:55.211
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:56.746
I feel you.
We just gotta think.

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:59.247
We gotta figure out
a way to get her, man.

01:09:02.854 --> 01:09:04.685
Got a plan.

01:09:04.857 --> 01:09:06.188

01:09:19.205 --> 01:09:20.263

What the fuck is this?!

01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:25.973
-Whoa, man!
-What the hell happened?

01:09:26.145 --> 01:09:26.975
What the fuck?!

01:09:27.145 --> 01:09:29.171

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:37.889
What the fuck is this shit?

01:09:42.795 --> 01:09:44.660
TJ, look at his face!

01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:46.661
Julian. Hey.

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:48.197
Yeah, Williamsons.

01:09:48.367 --> 01:09:50.392
That was some bitch-ass
shit you did right there.

01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:51.866
You better not
fuck with my girl!

01:09:52.037 --> 01:09:53.765
Hold on, watch out,

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.270

01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:06.948
Bitch-ass nigger!

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:07.949
You better not

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.088
Oh, shut the fuck up,
black buck.

01:10:10.256 --> 01:10:12.087
Hey, babe, come on.
He's OK.

01:10:13.092 --> 01:10:14.923
Clean this up, OK
Let's g--

01:10:16.428 --> 01:10:17.588
Come on.

01:10:48.727 --> 01:10:51.719
Get your ass in there. Go.

01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:06.371
Why'd they choose this place?

01:11:06.545 --> 01:11:08.536
Just keep your eyes open.

01:11:11.617 --> 01:11:12.447
Yo, they're here.

01:11:12.618 --> 01:11:13.949
Is everybody in position?

01:11:14.954 --> 01:11:16.080
In position.

01:11:16.255 --> 01:11:18.189
Good girl, Pam.
You see him?

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:19.688
Yeah, I can see him.

01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:20.790
What about you, Reggie?

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.087
I don't know.
Wait a minute. I'm lost.

01:11:23.262 --> 01:11:24.092
Hurry up, man.

01:11:24.263 --> 01:11:25.252
I can't be out here all day.

01:11:25.431 --> 01:11:26.420
I'm lookin' for it.

01:11:26.598 --> 01:11:28.463
It's section 3-0-6, dumbass.

01:11:28.634 --> 01:11:30.158
Look, man, I'm tryin'
to find the entrance.

01:11:30.336 --> 01:11:31.303
I can't find it.

01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:32.960
Get your ass upstairs!

01:11:46.752 --> 01:11:47.946
Boss.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.554
Fuck off. Boss that.

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.756
OK, birdie, where you at?

01:12:02.501 --> 01:12:03.866
so y'all early, huh?

01:12:04.036 --> 01:12:05.230
And you're late.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:06.393
Yeah, I'm late
'cause I had to go...

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:07.596
get something to eat.
That's why I'm late.

01:12:07.773 --> 01:12:09.172
OK, enough with the small talk.

01:12:09.341 --> 01:12:10.433
Right.
That's what I'm sayin'.

01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:11.769
I got shit to do, too.

01:12:11.944 --> 01:12:14.037
-Where's my diamonds at?
-Where's Gina at?

01:12:14.213 --> 01:12:15.805
show me the diamonds,
and I'll show you your bitch.

01:12:15.981 --> 01:12:17.039
Here.

01:12:17.216 --> 01:12:18.808
I don't know why the fuck
y'all doin' me like this.

01:12:18.984 --> 01:12:20.281
What if I took her
down in the hood...

01:12:20.452 --> 01:12:21.680
where they did the most good?

01:12:21.854 --> 01:12:23.287
Let all my buddies
rub on her booty.

01:12:23.455 --> 01:12:25.184
I wouldn't give a flying fuck.

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:28.353
Wave to your boyfriend.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.249
show me the rest
of the diamonds.

01:12:30.422 --> 01:12:31.411
Better let her go,
motherfucker!

01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:32.955
show me the rest
of the diamonds.

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:33.955
You all right?

01:12:34.126 --> 01:12:35.423
I'm fine.
I'm fine, baby.

01:12:35.594 --> 01:12:36.561
Let her go, man!

01:12:36.728 --> 01:12:39.663
show me the rest
of the fucking diamonds.

01:12:39.831 --> 01:12:41.423
Let her go.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.158
Come on.
Move it, bitch.

01:12:46.438 --> 01:12:47.871
It's cool, baby.
It's cool. I got it.

01:12:48.039 --> 01:12:49.472
What about you?

01:12:50.475 --> 01:12:51.305
I'm cool.

01:12:51.476 --> 01:12:53.444
All right.

01:12:55.647 --> 01:12:57.444
Fuck you.

01:12:57.616 --> 01:13:00.380
Give me the fuckin' stones,
you black bastard.

01:13:00.552 --> 01:13:02.918
You dubious, pestimistic,
nondescript, European...

01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:04.385
dick-in-a-booty-ass
motherfucker.

01:13:04.556 --> 01:13:05.853
Who do you think
you're talkin' to?

01:13:06.024 --> 01:13:07.855
Benny Hill.
Leonardo DiFaggio.

01:13:08.026 --> 01:13:10.051
Come on, you mango-munching
motherfucker.

01:13:10.228 --> 01:13:11.195
Give me the fuckin' stones.

01:13:11.363 --> 01:13:13.923
You little ugly-ass
motherfuckin' rat-mouth...

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:15.327
Gianni Ver-snatchy-lookin'
motherfucker.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.024
stones, you fucking
black nigger.

01:13:17.202 --> 01:13:19.966
Who you callin' a--you callin'
me a black nigger?

01:13:20.138 --> 01:13:22.299
Yeah, that's what
I'm calling you.

01:13:22.474 --> 01:13:23.964
My dick about
this long, white boy.

01:13:24.142 --> 01:13:25.040
You hear me?

01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:26.871
It'd take about four
of yours to get mine.

01:13:27.045 --> 01:13:27.977
This long.

01:13:28.146 --> 01:13:30.580
Yeah, listen, banana ear.
stones.

01:13:30.749 --> 01:13:31.579
I'm gonna put
a hit out on you...

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:32.580
when I get my welfare check.

01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:34.378
Give me the fuckin' stones!

01:13:34.553 --> 01:13:35.645
God damn it, hold it down!

01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:36.810
Y'all know who
y'all fuckin' with.

01:13:36.988 --> 01:13:38.387
Y'all fuckin' with
somethin' like a player.

01:13:38.557 --> 01:13:39.581
Can we just keep it civilized?

01:13:39.758 --> 01:13:40.918
I went to school for that.

01:13:41.092 --> 01:13:42.889
Civilization University.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:01.446
I want my bag back...

01:14:01.613 --> 01:14:04.081
'cause this is where
I keep my weed at, boy.

01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:08.352
That's nice.

01:14:09.621 --> 01:14:11.589
Now go buy a bar of soap,
shoeshine boy.

01:14:31.042 --> 01:14:32.600
Get the stones!

01:14:37.716 --> 01:14:39.616
shoot that motherfucker!

01:14:43.154 --> 01:14:45.816
-Baby!
-Oh, baby!

01:14:47.993 --> 01:14:48.823
Did you see me?

01:14:48.994 --> 01:14:50.393
I was like, "Fuck you!"

01:14:51.463 --> 01:14:53.021
That was tight!
Let me drive!

01:14:53.198 --> 01:14:54.358
Get in.

01:14:55.433 --> 01:14:56.923
Damn it, Bucum.
You made me break a nail.

01:14:57.102 --> 01:14:58.126
Hold on.

01:14:59.838 --> 01:15:01.203
Hold on.

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:05.198
You're dead!

01:15:17.589 --> 01:15:19.420
Move!

01:15:21.359 --> 01:15:22.451
Oh, shit!

01:15:33.138 --> 01:15:36.505
Now that we have the diamonds,
we can continue as planned.

01:15:36.675 --> 01:15:39.235
Can you drive a bit faster?

01:15:40.478 --> 01:15:41.502
There they go.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.510
What's up with
this window, dude?

01:15:42.681 --> 01:15:43.978
It don't work.
Where you get that?

01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:45.639
I got this from Mrs. Barkley.

01:15:47.218 --> 01:15:49.118
Don't you think the police
will be looking for us?

01:15:49.287 --> 01:15:51.050
sweetheart...

01:15:51.222 --> 01:15:52.849
by the time
they figure this out...

01:15:53.024 --> 01:15:56.289
we'll be lying on a beach
somewhere in south America...

01:15:56.461 --> 01:15:57.450
on our honeymoon.

01:16:00.065 --> 01:16:01.623
Well, then, just
shoot out the back tire!

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.233
Who do you think I am?
Mel Gibson?

01:16:03.401 --> 01:16:04.959
Just the tires!

01:16:06.237 --> 01:16:08.137
Oh, motherfucker!

01:16:08.306 --> 01:16:09.967
Yeah, boy! What, what?

01:16:10.141 --> 01:16:11.199
Good shot, baby.

01:16:15.714 --> 01:16:17.511
Come on, step on it!

01:16:50.915 --> 01:16:52.473
Pull over!

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.920
Whoa, baby!

01:16:58.757 --> 01:17:00.088
Bucum !

01:17:30.288 --> 01:17:33.086
Damn, your car smell like fish.

01:17:34.392 --> 01:17:36.451
I still can't believe
you threw them diamonds...

01:17:36.628 --> 01:17:38.061
in the air to cause a diversion.

01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:39.787
I can't believe you came up
with a bullshit plan...

01:17:39.964 --> 01:17:41.090
that almost got me killed.

01:17:41.266 --> 01:17:43.564
All you had to do--

01:17:43.735 --> 01:17:44.724
keep the diamonds
in your hand...

01:17:44.903 --> 01:17:46.336
when you jump down
the escalator, man.

01:17:46.504 --> 01:17:47.835
That's simple.
That's simple.

01:17:48.006 --> 01:17:49.405
That wasn't part of the plan,
Bucum.

01:17:49.574 --> 01:17:51.667
so fuckin' what?!
Improvise!

01:17:51.843 --> 01:17:53.003
Improvise?
sniper got a gun...

01:17:53.178 --> 01:17:54.475
pointin' down on my
head, about to shoot.

01:17:54.646 --> 01:17:56.614
You know what?
Fuck them diamonds, man.

01:17:56.781 --> 01:17:58.612
What about my ticket that was
left in that Benz?

01:17:58.783 --> 01:17:59.647
And it's gone.

01:17:59.818 --> 01:18:00.842
You wanna be a bitch
about my diamonds?

01:18:01.019 --> 01:18:03.579
I can be a bitch about
your ticket. Period.

01:18:03.755 --> 01:18:04.949
I quit, motherfucker!
How about that?

01:18:05.123 --> 01:18:06.454
Come on, baby.
Let's go.

01:18:06.624 --> 01:18:08.990
Quit?! Quit what?!

01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:11.119
All we are
are two motherfuckers...

01:18:11.296 --> 01:18:12.854
tryin' to get paid.
That's all.

01:18:13.031 --> 01:18:14.760
That's it!

01:18:14.933 --> 01:18:17.367
It's all about
the Benjamins, remember?

01:18:17.535 --> 01:18:19.298
so don't get it twisted,
motherfucker!

01:18:19.471 --> 01:18:21.666
Bucum, don't be so mean.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.536
Don't say nothin' to him.
He just mad 'cause I quit!

01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:27.473
Quit? Quit again!
Quit again after that!

01:18:27.645 --> 01:18:29.135
I don't care about that!

01:18:29.314 --> 01:18:31.544
'Cause we was never
partners anyway!

01:18:31.716 --> 01:18:35.174
You thought we was partners,
but we wasn't never partners.

01:18:36.287 --> 01:18:37.652
I'm gonna tell you somethin'
straight up, man.

01:18:37.822 --> 01:18:38.811
since we ain't partners...

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:41.185
why the fuck we standin'
here, talkin' right now?

01:18:41.359 --> 01:18:43.452
Me and Gina could do this
by our damn self, man.

01:18:43.628 --> 01:18:46.119
Fuck them diamonds, Bucum.
Come on, baby.

01:18:47.165 --> 01:18:48.826
Man--

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.399
Bucum, you're wrong.

01:18:50.568 --> 01:18:51.398
Hey--hey--

01:18:51.569 --> 01:18:52.558
-Go--
-Did you--

01:18:52.737 --> 01:18:54.136
Go talk to him.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.500
-Reggie!
-Go!

01:18:56.674 --> 01:18:59.040
I g--I'm goin'!
Reggie!

01:19:01.179 --> 01:19:03.409
Look, man.

01:19:03.581 --> 01:19:07.073
Let's end this
on a good note, OK

01:19:07.252 --> 01:19:10.153
We got Gina back,
and when you really...

01:19:10.321 --> 01:19:11.811
think about it,
that's all that matters.

01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:13.423
I--look, what the hell
do you want me to s--

01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:14.580
That's not all.

01:19:17.328 --> 01:19:19.523
All right.
Fuck that ticket, man.

01:19:19.697 --> 01:19:21.858
All right. Fuck them
diamonds, man. Cool?

01:19:22.033 --> 01:19:23.091
It's cool. It's cool.

01:19:23.268 --> 01:19:24.667
You're my dog. We gotta
Look out for each other, man.

01:19:24.836 --> 01:19:25.962
We might need each
other in the future.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:27.104
We're partners.

01:19:27.272 --> 01:19:29.103
-Hey!
-What?

01:19:29.274 --> 01:19:30.241
You know what?
After you blow that--

01:19:30.408 --> 01:19:31.807
Blow this!

01:19:33.878 --> 01:19:35.743
Hey, you see that?

01:19:35.914 --> 01:19:37.905
-Come on!
-Come on, baby.

01:19:38.082 --> 01:19:38.912
Hey, come on!

01:19:39.083 --> 01:19:40.209
Let's go.

01:19:58.536 --> 01:20:01.334
Clean all this shit
out of the car.

01:20:39.444 --> 01:20:41.139
Do you want to count the money?

01:20:41.312 --> 01:20:42.973
No, thanks.

01:20:53.758 --> 01:20:56.818
Merci. Au revoir.

01:21:01.566 --> 01:21:04.228
so it's off to Rio.

01:21:22.687 --> 01:21:25.349
You think Williamson
and them in that boat, too?

01:21:25.523 --> 01:21:27.047
There's only one way
to find out.

01:21:27.225 --> 01:21:28.453
Pam, you and Gina stay here.

01:21:28.626 --> 01:21:31.595
If you see anything funny, call
them punk-ass Miami police.

01:21:31.763 --> 01:21:32.593
Come on.

01:21:32.764 --> 01:21:34.425
I ain't got no bullets
in this gun, man.

01:21:34.599 --> 01:21:35.930
What you bring it for?

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.431
To scare 'em or somethin'.

01:21:37.602 --> 01:21:39.502
Look, this is my baby, OK

01:21:39.671 --> 01:21:40.501
Hold that, baby.

01:21:40.672 --> 01:21:41.866
Handle it with care.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.166
All right.

01:21:43.341 --> 01:21:44.433
Let's go.

01:21:58.389 --> 01:21:59.879
Give me that.

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:02.051
"Wait here."

01:22:02.226 --> 01:22:04.217
What, they think
we can't do anything?

01:22:04.395 --> 01:22:06.989
Those motherfuckers
kidnapped me!

01:22:10.168 --> 01:22:11.465
Can you jump?

01:22:13.438 --> 01:22:14.564
Come on.

01:22:15.573 --> 01:22:17.370
-What happened?
-I dropped your gun.

01:22:17.542 --> 01:22:20.568
I oughta kick your ass.
Come on.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:32.054
Hey, man, how are you gonna
just drop my favorite gun?

01:22:32.223 --> 01:22:33.053
Man, it slipped out of my hand.

01:22:33.224 --> 01:22:34.088
I ain't never been
on no boat before.

01:22:34.258 --> 01:22:36.351
Fuck all that!

01:22:36.527 --> 01:22:37.755
Here. Use this.

01:22:37.929 --> 01:22:39.089
Oh, my God.

01:22:39.263 --> 01:22:40.628
I cannot believe this shit.

01:22:40.798 --> 01:22:42.163
What the fuck is
I'm gonna do with--

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:43.630
them dudes got guns up in here.

01:22:43.801 --> 01:22:45.860
Hey, it's better
than nothin', man.

01:22:46.037 --> 01:22:47.527
I don't want it, dude.
Gimme that, then,

01:22:47.705 --> 01:22:48.694
if it's better than nothin'.

01:22:48.873 --> 01:22:50.534
No! This mine!
Forget it.

01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:51.538
Don't use nothin', then.

01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:52.539
That's what I'm sayin'.

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:53.540
Five fingers.
Use your five fingers.

01:22:53.711 --> 01:22:54.541
stickin' to my guns.

01:22:54.712 --> 01:22:55.542
Well, stick to your guns.

01:22:55.713 --> 01:22:56.543
You know what?

01:22:56.714 --> 01:22:57.942
Give it here.
I'll take it.

01:22:58.116 --> 01:23:00.141
Be careful.

01:23:00.318 --> 01:23:02.718
You got batteries to this
motherfucker right here?

01:23:02.887 --> 01:23:03.785
Come on!

01:23:03.955 --> 01:23:06.355
When do you get your cut?

01:23:07.658 --> 01:23:13.187
When I say you get your cuts.

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:15.662
I'm a man of my word, right?

01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:16.993
Right?

01:23:18.002 --> 01:23:19.196
Right.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:24.899
Now, pop up deck, 'cause I have
some business to attend to.

01:23:30.248 --> 01:23:31.579
Let's go.

01:23:46.497 --> 01:23:47.987
I love you.

01:23:58.042 --> 01:23:59.066
What are we gonna do now?

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.210
I don't know.

01:24:00.378 --> 01:24:02.573
But we gotta do somethin'.

01:24:02.747 --> 01:24:03.941
Gimme the gun.

01:24:04.115 --> 01:24:05.446
It don't have any bullets.

01:24:05.616 --> 01:24:07.015
Gimme the gun.

01:24:11.856 --> 01:24:13.517
What the hell was that?

01:24:27.905 --> 01:24:28.735
Yes!

01:24:28.906 --> 01:24:29.736
Oh, ho, we did it!

01:24:29.907 --> 01:24:32.068
-Damn!
-What?

01:24:36.247 --> 01:24:37.214
What?

01:24:37.381 --> 01:24:39.246
I just seen two people
fall in the water.

01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:41.146
You seen two people
fall in the water?

01:24:41.319 --> 01:24:42.479
Two people.

01:24:42.653 --> 01:24:45.121
And I think it was that big dude
that was at the track.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:47.154
Bullshit.
I don't see nobody.

01:24:49.861 --> 01:24:52.193
What the hell them girls
doin' out there?

01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:57.726
Bucum, hold up for a minute.

01:25:05.743 --> 01:25:08.143
Oh, my wallet. Goddamn.

01:25:14.218 --> 01:25:15.947
Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.678
sixty million.

01:25:21.092 --> 01:25:21.990
sixty million.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.593
That's what I'm talking about.

01:25:23.761 --> 01:25:25.388
Yes! $60 million.

01:25:25.563 --> 01:25:26.723
I'm about about to go
to the club, be like--

01:25:26.898 --> 01:25:29.093
Look what a nigga won.
sixty million.

01:25:29.267 --> 01:25:31.827
What a--what a--
what a--sixty million--

01:25:32.003 --> 01:25:34.301
You again, Mr. Wright?

01:25:34.472 --> 01:25:37.566
You know what?
You're like a cockroach.

01:25:37.742 --> 01:25:39.642
Every time you crush one...

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:41.573
another one comes creepin'
out of the woodwork.

01:25:41.746 --> 01:25:44.078
You know what? It's funny
that you said that...

01:25:44.248 --> 01:25:46.375
'cause I'm black, and I know
about all kind of roaches.

01:25:46.551 --> 01:25:48.143
Gangster roaches, I know
a Puerto Rican roa--

01:25:48.319 --> 01:25:49.752
shut up.

01:25:49.921 --> 01:25:54.085
sweetheart, take the bags,
and put 'em in a speedboat...

01:25:54.258 --> 01:25:56.385
and start her up.

01:25:58.663 --> 01:26:01.063
And you.
Pick up the bags.

01:26:01.232 --> 01:26:02.426
see, I knew you was
a gangster...

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:03.624
when I first seen you.
You look just like--

01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:05.063
Get the fuckin' bags.

01:26:05.236 --> 01:26:06.669
Look, man, why you gonna
try to shoot me, man?

01:26:06.837 --> 01:26:08.429
-You need--
-The bags!

01:26:08.606 --> 01:26:10.597
Don't shoot me!
Please don't shoot me.

01:26:10.775 --> 01:26:12.037
I ain't got no insurance.

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:13.108
I'm on Medicaid.

01:26:13.277 --> 01:26:14.574
They got me on all kind of--

01:26:14.745 --> 01:26:17.805
-1, 2, 3...
-OK.

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:20.680
sharks don't even like
black people.

01:26:20.851 --> 01:26:21.783
shut up.

01:26:21.953 --> 01:26:22.920
They don't like black
people, though, man.

01:26:23.087 --> 01:26:24.349
Unless you put
some barbecue sauce...

01:26:24.522 --> 01:26:25.546
on me or somethin'.

01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:26.985
And then they'll deal
with a black man.

01:26:27.158 --> 01:26:28.853
And I'm tellin' you,
I heard you in there pimpin'...

01:26:29.026 --> 01:26:30.459
and I'm lettin' you know that.

01:26:30.628 --> 01:26:32.960
shut the fuck up,
put the cases down.

01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:34.893
Hi, sweetheart.

01:26:35.066 --> 01:26:36.033
We're takin' this
piece of shit out...

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.633
going to feed him to the sharks.

01:26:37.802 --> 01:26:39.269
Not so fast, scarface.

01:26:40.972 --> 01:26:42.837
I got wifey here
and we ain't goin' nowhere.

01:26:44.175 --> 01:26:45.005
You're forgettin' somethin'.

01:26:45.176 --> 01:26:46.108
What's that?

01:26:46.277 --> 01:26:47.369
she's not my wife yet.

01:27:34.725 --> 01:27:36.420
Come on!

01:28:17.935 --> 01:28:20.096
say your prayers.

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.588
You're lucky I didn't
break your fuckin' neck.

01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:53.068
Reggie, I'm here, man.

01:28:53.237 --> 01:28:54.602
Where you get hit at?

01:28:54.772 --> 01:28:57.138
I got shot, man.
I got hit in the chest.

01:28:57.308 --> 01:28:59.299
Hit in the back.

01:28:59.477 --> 01:29:01.502
I got shot about five times,
dude.

01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:04.170
Oh, man, you just hit
in the arm.

01:29:04.348 --> 01:29:06.145
Be careful, man.
I'm gonna faint.

01:29:06.317 --> 01:29:08.512
Is it over yet?

01:29:08.686 --> 01:29:10.176
It's over.

01:29:12.456 --> 01:29:14.481
We did it.

01:29:14.658 --> 01:29:17.422
-We did it.
-We did it, man.

01:29:17.595 --> 01:29:18.562
Dig in my pocket.

01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:19.991
I want you to get
somethin' for me.

01:29:20.164 --> 01:29:21.927
Wait a minute, nigga.
We ain't that close.

01:29:22.099 --> 01:29:23.657
Come on, man.
stop playin', man.

01:29:23.834 --> 01:29:26.826
I'm shot.
Dig in my pocket.

01:29:34.478 --> 01:29:36.639
I see you got what
you was lookin' for.

01:29:36.814 --> 01:29:39.374
Yes, sir. And I was
gonna cut you in...

01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:40.847
even though you don't
care about my ticket.

01:29:41.018 --> 01:29:42.485
I didn't say I didn't care
about your ticket, man.

01:29:42.653 --> 01:29:44.120
There you are,
you fuckin' bastard!

01:29:44.288 --> 01:29:45.448
Oh, shit!

01:29:45.623 --> 01:29:46.954
You fuckin'--

01:30:10.347 --> 01:30:12.076
I hate this fuckin' job.

01:30:12.249 --> 01:30:13.580
Hey, you ain't
gotta work no more.

01:30:13.751 --> 01:30:14.718
We rich now.

01:30:14.885 --> 01:30:16.216
shit, I know.

01:30:17.288 --> 01:30:19.017
-Not so fast.
-What?

01:30:19.190 --> 01:30:20.282
Here come the Coast Guard.

01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:21.584
What are we gonna do, Bucum?

01:30:21.759 --> 01:30:23.624
I don't know. Damn!

01:30:23.794 --> 01:30:25.921
somethin' I hate to do,
but I gotta do it.

01:30:26.096 --> 01:30:27.290
sorry about that, player.

01:30:27.465 --> 01:30:29.399
I love you, but you gotta go.

01:30:29.567 --> 01:30:31.091
What the fuck is--

01:30:31.268 --> 01:30:33.099
That's my fuckin' arm, man!

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:35.670
Look, all you got is
a punk-ass warrant.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.535
I gotta turn you in, man.

01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:38.766
Let 'em know everything
that happened.

01:30:38.943 --> 01:30:41.173
If not, we goin' to jail
for a hell of a long time.

01:30:41.345 --> 01:30:42.676
And I know you don't
wanna do that.

01:30:42.847 --> 01:30:44.872
Man, this is some bullshit, man.

01:30:45.049 --> 01:30:45.947
Look, look, look, man.

01:30:46.116 --> 01:30:47.048
All you gotta do is
keep your mouth shut.

01:30:47.218 --> 01:30:48.412
You'll be out in less than
two weeks, man.

01:30:48.586 --> 01:30:49.814
I'll be right there
with your ticket, man.

01:30:49.987 --> 01:30:51.477
I swear.
You just gotta trust me.

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:52.485
You are fuckin' crazy.

01:30:52.656 --> 01:30:53.486
I'm sittin' here in handcuffs...

01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:54.919
you want me
to fuckin' trust you?

01:30:55.092 --> 01:30:55.922
Man, trust me.

01:30:56.093 --> 01:30:57.082
Man, that's some
bull--look, look.

01:30:57.261 --> 01:30:58.751
Nigga, I got shot.

01:30:58.929 --> 01:31:00.624
I got shot while we was
doin' this shit.

01:31:00.798 --> 01:31:01.992
Nigga, you ain't
gonna do nothin'...

01:31:02.166 --> 01:31:03.463
but try and go fuck Gina,
nigga.

01:31:03.634 --> 01:31:04.532
Hold that thought.

01:31:04.702 --> 01:31:06.135
You gonna try to get
Gina, ain't you?

01:31:06.303 --> 01:31:08.464
You pussy-ass motherfucker!

01:31:08.639 --> 01:31:11.039
You ain't right, and you know
you ain't right.

01:31:11.208 --> 01:31:14.075
God don't like ugly, and you is
an ugly motherfucker.

01:31:14.245 --> 01:31:16.270
I swear, I hate you, Bucum.

01:31:16.447 --> 01:31:18.347
You gonna try and get
Gina, ain't you?

01:31:18.516 --> 01:31:21.280
I know that's why you
got me in these cuffs...

01:31:47.611 --> 01:31:49.374
This motherfu--

01:31:49.547 --> 01:31:52.641
I knew I couldn't trust
that nigga, man!

01:31:52.816 --> 01:31:55.250
And I'm supposed
to be the con man!

01:32:44.301 --> 01:32:45.791
Yo, Reggie!

01:32:49.373 --> 01:32:52.206
Whoo! That was a long-ass
two weeks, man.

01:32:53.210 --> 01:32:55.838
What's up, baby?
My, this is clean. Man!

01:32:56.013 --> 01:32:57.810
I want you to put me
all in chrome...

01:32:57.982 --> 01:33:00.348
and put me on the front
of the Bentley, like this.

01:33:01.452 --> 01:33:03.283
What's up, man?
When you get this?

01:33:03.454 --> 01:33:04.785
Hey, man, you get
a whole lot of things...

01:33:04.955 --> 01:33:07.355
when you turn in $10 million
in dirty money, you know?

01:33:07.524 --> 01:33:08.422
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

01:33:08.592 --> 01:33:10.253
What about that other
ten million?

01:33:10.427 --> 01:33:12.258
I don't know what happened
to that other ten million.

01:33:12.429 --> 01:33:13.919
Ooh, that's a nice watch!

01:33:14.098 --> 01:33:15.030
Can I rock that?
Lemme wear that.

01:33:15.199 --> 01:33:16.530
Bling, bling, motherfucker.

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:17.724
Look what Gina got.

01:33:17.901 --> 01:33:20.802
You got the ticket!

01:33:20.971 --> 01:33:22.996
You got the tick--

Let's go spend this money.

01:33:49.466 --> 01:33:51.127
How's it goin', partner?

01:33:51.301 --> 01:33:53.166
You know how a player do it!

01:33:54.872 --> 01:33:57.170
I see gettin' all that money
don't make you no smarter.

01:34:02.046 --> 01:34:04.241

hustlers doin'?
