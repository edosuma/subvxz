00:15.382 --> 00:16.576
Sorry.

00:16.649 --> 00:17.581
l didn't realize

00:17.650 --> 00:19.345
that you'd been
assigned here today.

00:19.419 --> 00:20.647
l wasn't.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.312
This space was unoccupied,

00:22.389 --> 00:24.118
so l came here to work.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.680
On what?

00:25.759 --> 00:28.125
l'm reconfiguring
the power couplings

00:28.194 --> 00:29.218
in this section.

00:29.295 --> 00:31.286
Why?

00:31.364 --> 00:34.231
The Astrometrics Lab
requires additional energy.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.562
l see.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.626
So you're rerouting power
from other locations

00:37.704 --> 00:39.331
like...Engineering.

00:41.107 --> 00:42.802
They are minor adjustments.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.844
Primary systems
will not be affected.

00:44.911 --> 00:46.173
Unless, of course,
someone is trying

00:46.246 --> 00:47.941
to do a warp core diagnostic,

00:48.014 --> 00:49.743
which my crew has been
trying to do all morning.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.550
We have lost hours of work
because of this.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.816
There is no need for anger.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.983
l had no intention
of causing a problem.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.290
What,"sorry" isn't
in the Borg vocabulary?

01:04.297 --> 01:05.594
You need to check with me

01:05.665 --> 01:07.565
before you touch
the power systems.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.261
Understood?

01:10.437 --> 01:11.802
Understood.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.848
l am unaccustomed
to working in a hierarchy.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.974
ln the collective,

01:24.050 --> 01:26.280
there was no need
to ask permission.

01:26.352 --> 01:28.183
lf you're going to be
a member of this crew,

01:28.254 --> 01:29.312
get used to it.

01:29.389 --> 01:30.720
Procedures exist for a reason.

01:30.790 --> 01:31.984
We've got to work together.

01:32.058 --> 01:33.889
We follow
the same set of rules...

01:37.430 --> 01:39.364
Lieutenant?

01:39.432 --> 01:42.128
l was given that lecture once,

01:42.202 --> 01:45.330
by Captain Janeway
when l first joined this crew.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.243
lf l could adjust
to Starfleet life...

01:52.312 --> 01:53.802
so can you.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.577
Of course.

01:56.649 --> 01:57.877
l am...

01:57.951 --> 01:59.976
sorry for the inconvenience.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.449
Doc, l've got to go
run a few errands.

02:07.527 --> 02:08.459
l'll be back soon.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.792
Not so fast, Mr. Paris.

02:10.864 --> 02:11.922
Can't these errands wait

02:11.998 --> 02:13.522
until the end
of your duty shift?

02:13.600 --> 02:17.627
Uh...well, it's my conn report,
actually.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.831
l just realized
l forgot to turn it in

02:19.906 --> 02:21.874
and Chakotay gives me
a hard time when it's late.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.932
You've been here all afternoon.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.444
Didn't this occur to you before?

02:26.513 --> 02:29.107
Well, we've been so...busy

02:29.182 --> 02:31.912
that l guess it just
slipped my mind.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.985
l see.

02:35.054 --> 02:39.081
Well, since it's an emergency,
don't let me stand in your way.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.558
Thanks.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.858
Sir.

03:08.154 --> 03:10.019
Computer, lock on
to these coordinates.

03:10.089 --> 03:12.148
l need
a site- to- site transport.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.557
No, wait.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.925
Access the central
replicator files first.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.397
Ah...

03:21.467 --> 03:23.332
perfect.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.743
Are those supposed to make up
for canceling on me last night?

03:40.820 --> 03:43.186
l got stuck with an extra shift
on the Bridge.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.587
What could l say--

03:44.657 --> 03:47.182
"Sorry, Captain,
l've got a date with B'Elanna"?

03:48.194 --> 03:49.889
And what about right now?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.124
Aren't you supposed
to be working in Sick Bay?

03:52.198 --> 03:54.894
l said l had to go
deliver a conn report.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.435
Not bad.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.868
But he'll be expecting you back.

03:58.938 --> 04:00.769
He can wait.

04:11.851 --> 04:12.977
What is it?

04:14.587 --> 04:17.488
l just had the feeling
that somebody was watching us.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.684
l must be completely paranoid

04:19.759 --> 04:23.456
about getting caught in
a compromising position.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.963
Kind of exciting, isn't it?

06:18.878 --> 06:21.369
Your trapezius
is hard as a rock.

06:21.447 --> 06:22.436
You haven't been following

06:22.515 --> 06:24.244
the relaxation regimen
l prescribed for you.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.545
l've been too busy.

06:25.618 --> 06:26.915
The usual story.

06:26.986 --> 06:28.146
Have you been getting
enough sleep?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.916
More or less.
Mostly less.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.651
Mm- hmm. And have your headaches
been getting any worse?

06:32.725 --> 06:35.626
No, but they're not getting
any better either.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.687
They're like hot needles
driving into my skull.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.734
These symptoms are
hardly surprising, Captain.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.393
You work absurdly long hours

06:43.469 --> 06:45.937
under constant stress,
eating on the run,

06:46.005 --> 06:48.405
without sufficient
exercise or rest.

06:48.474 --> 06:51.705
Your body is crying
out for mercy.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.643
lt certainly is right now.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.908
There must be some easier
way to do this, Doctor.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.609
A hypospray, maybe?

06:57.683 --> 06:58.980
Always looking
for the simple fix.

06:59.051 --> 07:00.450
Sometimes there's
no substitute for

07:00.520 --> 07:03.353
intensive osteopathic
pressure therapy.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.357
You're fortunate
to have a masseur

07:05.425 --> 07:07.518
who can work all day
without tiring.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.151
Bridge to the Captain.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.423
Commander, unless
this is an emergency

07:11.497 --> 07:12.987
my patient is unavailable.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.226
l'm here, Chakotay.
What is it?

07:15.301 --> 07:17.496
We've reached the source
of those energy readings

07:17.570 --> 07:19.800
and l thought you'd like
to see what we've found.

07:19.872 --> 07:20.839
On my way.

07:20.907 --> 07:21.839
Captain...

07:21.908 --> 07:23.239
l know what you're
going to say, Doctor,

07:23.309 --> 07:24.640
but l can't neglect
my responsibilities.

07:24.710 --> 07:27.110
Actually, l was going to
suggest a change of outfit.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.550
Binary pulsars.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.745
The gravitational forces
between them are so intense

07:34.821 --> 07:36.652
that everything
within 50 million kilometers

07:36.722 --> 07:38.212
is getting pulled in.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.589
Don't worry.
We're well out of range.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.629
Gamma radiation levels are high,
but as long as we're careful

07:43.696 --> 07:45.960
l think we can collect
some invaluable data.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.768
Captain, am l boring you?

07:49.836 --> 07:51.565
l'm sorry.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.162
l guess l'm a little
too tired to concentrate

07:54.240 --> 07:55.969
on stellar phenomena
right now.

07:56.042 --> 07:59.500
l'll leave this project
in your capable hands, hmm?

08:08.888 --> 08:10.947
You wanted to see me,
Lieutenant?

08:11.023 --> 08:13.116
Yes. l'm trying to increase

08:13.192 --> 08:15.854
the efficiency
of the impulse drive,

08:15.962 --> 08:16.986
but l wanted to make sure

08:17.063 --> 08:18.360
that l wasn't compromising
helm control.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.864
Sensible precaution.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.058
l'd be glad to help.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.863
Good. All of the specs
are at my upper workstation.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.167
Then let's get started.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.251
Did you hear something?

08:43.322 --> 08:44.983
You always think
you hear something.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.653
Commander.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.163
Lieutenant.

08:52.231 --> 08:55.064
Here is the power usage data
you requested.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.226
Right. Of course.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.828
l didn't expect it
quite so...promptly.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.771
Which l guess l should
have, uh, coming from you.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.806
l mean, l'm grateful

09:02.842 --> 09:04.776
that you got the data
to me so quickly.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.845
Thanks.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.255
Tuvok.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.587
Tuvok, l guess that was
kind of embarrassing.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.360
l don't experience
embarrassment.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.957
Right.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.196
Well, then l guess
there's no harm done.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.294
lt's not like there was

09:32.371 --> 09:33.861
a security violation
or anything.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.907
None that l am aware of.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.772
So, l guess there's nothing

09:37.843 --> 09:40.903
that would have to go
on any kind of report.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.141
You want me to conceal
what l've observed

09:43.215 --> 09:45.581
of your relationship
with Lieutenant Torres.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.313
Well, l'd certainly
never ask you

09:48.387 --> 09:49.684
to be dishonest.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.848
Certainly not.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.931
Do you think he'll say
anything to the Captain?

09:59.999 --> 10:01.091
l don't know.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.896
Well, how did he sound?

10:02.969 --> 10:05.130
Annoyed? Amused?

10:05.204 --> 10:06.535
He sounded Vulcan.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.971
What more can l tell you?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.064
Deck 1.

10:09.141 --> 10:12.304
We have got to be more
careful with appearances.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.573
We shouldn't go into the
briefing at the same time.

10:14.647 --> 10:15.705
Good idea.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.749
Okay, you go in first.
l'll come in a minute later.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.751
No. That'll look
even more suspicious.

10:19.819 --> 10:20.808
Listen to us.

10:20.886 --> 10:21.875
We're acting like criminals

10:21.954 --> 10:23.387
when we haven't done
anything wrong.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.980
Well, l'm not saying
that we have.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.992
l just thought we wanted to keep
this relationship to ourselves.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.755
We do, right?

10:30.763 --> 10:31.957
Do you?

10:32.031 --> 10:33.191
lf you do.

10:35.234 --> 10:37.464
Computer, halt turbolift.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.504
Let's figure out how we're
going to handle this.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.005
Well...

10:41.073 --> 10:43.007
l don't think that it's
anybody else's business

10:43.075 --> 10:44.633
how we feel about each other.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.041
Neither do l.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.170
Right, then we're agreed.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.477
We're just a little
more careful in public

10:50.549 --> 10:52.380
and we don't say
anything to anybody.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.816
At least for now.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.046
Now?

10:55.121 --> 10:57.487
Sounds like you see
a future in this.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.418
l would never be
so presumptuous.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.620
Smooth recovery, Lieutenant.

11:02.695 --> 11:03.662
l thought so.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.526
Computer, resume.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.468
So l'll go first,
and you follow.

11:09.535 --> 11:10.661
Right.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.865
Here's the plan.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.204
We'll circle the two pulsars

11:18.277 --> 11:20.404
at a minimum distance
of 80 million kilometers.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.447
That might not be far enough.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.608
We've been detecting
some random proton bursts.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.151
A strong one could
knock out our shields.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.150
Tom, go to 90.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.846
Keep it a safe distance.

11:28.921 --> 11:29.979
Yes, sir.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.115
Tuvok, keep our shields
at maximum strength.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.785
Divert auxiliary power
if you need it.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.691
l want to take every precaution
on this survey.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.992
Report any problems immediately,
no matter how small.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.396
Dismissed.

11:42.401 --> 11:43.663
Lieutenants Paris and Torres,

11:43.736 --> 11:45.727
l'd like to speak
with you for a moment.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.466
Thanks.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.239
l don't usually pry

11:54.313 --> 11:56.838
into the personal lives
of my crew, but in this case,

11:56.916 --> 11:58.747
l have to question
your recent conduct.

11:58.818 --> 11:59.750
l guess Tuvok...

11:59.819 --> 12:00.683
Tuvok?

12:00.786 --> 12:02.219
l haven't heard a word
from Tuvok.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.121
But you two have been making
enough of a public display

12:05.191 --> 12:07.091
that half the ship
is gossiping about it.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.751
Believe me, that wasn't
our intention...

12:08.828 --> 12:10.022
You are senior officers

12:10.096 --> 12:11.723
and l expect you
to maintain the standard

12:11.797 --> 12:12.821
for the rest of the crew.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.627
But this adolescent behavior

12:14.700 --> 12:17.168
makes me question my faith
in you both.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.364
lf you choose
to pursue a relationship,

12:20.439 --> 12:21.929
that's your business.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.498
But you consider yourselves
under orders

12:24.577 --> 12:26.636
to use better judgment about it.

12:26.712 --> 12:27.906
ls that understood?

12:27.980 --> 12:30.073
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, Captain.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.049
Dismissed.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.237
Computer, hot coffee-- black.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.872
Commander Chakotay is suffering
bone decalcification,

13:38.951 --> 13:41.818
tissue necrosis,
decreased visual acuity--

13:41.887 --> 13:43.684
all classic signs of aging--

13:43.756 --> 13:44.984
but they've developed
within hours.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.580
Any theories?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.957
There's a rare genetic
disorder called progeria,

13:49.028 --> 13:51.360
which causes children
to age prematurely.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.988
But there's never
been an adult case

13:53.098 --> 13:56.499
and it was supposedly
eradicated two centuries ago.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.561
Even so, l took a close look
at your DNA.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.538
These segments regulate
your body's metabolism.

14:01.640 --> 14:02.937
My scans

14:02.975 --> 14:05.637
indicate that they've been
hyper- stimulated somehow.

14:05.711 --> 14:06.905
What's the prognosis?

14:06.979 --> 14:09.743
l can't speculate on that
until l've identified the cause.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.510
There's no sign
of an infectious agent.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.916
We spent several hours
near a binary pulsar

14:14.019 --> 14:16.453
that was emitting
intense gamma radiation.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.489
Our shields were operating.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.251
l don't see how l could
have been exposed to it.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.259
At this point, we can't
rule out anything.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.591
l'm going to take a closer look
at the data we collected.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.789
We should also run
scans of my quarters,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.696
as well as my office
and the Bridge--

14:27.766 --> 14:28.755
everywhere l've been today.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.096
l'm not prepared

14:30.169 --> 14:31.830
to send you back
on duty yet, Commander.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.132
l may look pretty strange,

14:33.205 --> 14:34.695
but my mind is perfectly clear.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.764
l'd rather stay busy
than just sit here.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.901
l have no idea how your symptoms
will progress.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.946
You should remain
in Sick Bay for observation.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.605
He's right, Chakotay.

14:42.681 --> 14:43.739
l'll keep you informed.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.751
Whatever's affecting
the Commander's DNA

14:46.819 --> 14:48.980
is working
at a submolecular level.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.953
l'd like to set up
an electron resonance scanner

14:51.023 --> 14:52.581
in the Science Lab
to get a closer look.

14:52.658 --> 14:53.590
Use whatever you need.

14:53.659 --> 14:54.990
And ask B'Elanna
to give you a hand.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.186
Still having headaches, Captain?

14:56.262 --> 14:58.696
l don't need any more lectures
about working too hard, Doctor.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.130
Chakotay's the one who needs
your attention right now.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.633
l'll get to work
on the scanner right away.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.966
"Under orders
to use better judgment"?

15:06.038 --> 15:07.027
Well, that's pretty harsh.

15:07.106 --> 15:09.040
l hope l can manage it.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.042
Well, she does have a point.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.839
You could have been
more discreet.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.311
Oh. l forgot l was talking

15:14.380 --> 15:16.348
to the most upstanding
Ensign in Starfleet.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.382
Good morning.

15:17.449 --> 15:18.381
Neelix.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.474
l was just about to whip up

15:19.551 --> 15:20.779
a fresh batch
of scrambled eggs.

15:20.853 --> 15:21.785
Would you like some?

15:21.854 --> 15:24.254
Actually,
l was hoping you might have

15:24.323 --> 15:27.087
some leftover pleeka rind
casserole from last night.

15:27.159 --> 15:28.490
For breakfast?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.118
l like it.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.459
l'm sure l can
find some for you.

15:32.531 --> 15:36.934
So, l guess your relationship
isn't exactly a secret anymore.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.334
Do you think anybody on this
ship can keep a secret?

15:42.474 --> 15:43.964
Neelix!

15:46.345 --> 15:49.212
Aah...aah...
What's...

15:49.281 --> 15:50.213
what's happening?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.214
Paris to the Doctor.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.307
l'm bringing Neelix to Sick Bay.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.351
lt's an emergency.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.650
Now pay attention, Mr. Paris.

15:58.724 --> 16:01.420
These scans should indicate
whether...

16:01.493 --> 16:02.653
Hmm.

16:02.728 --> 16:03.854
What is it?

16:03.929 --> 16:05.863
lt seems that your DNA
has been hyper- stimulated

16:05.931 --> 16:07.762
just like Commander Chakotay's.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.494
But Neelix doesn't
seem to be aging.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.263
No. The effects
are quite different.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.770
lf anything, l look...
like a Mylean.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.274
They occupy a region
of space near Talax.

16:17.343 --> 16:18.275
lnteresting.

16:18.344 --> 16:21.905
Do Talaxians and Myleans
share a common ancestry?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.881
Not that l know of.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.348
Do the two races
ever intermarry?

16:25.417 --> 16:30.787
Yes. As a matter of fact,
my great- grandfather was Mylean.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.517
Then one- eighth
of your genetic material

16:32.591 --> 16:33.853
was inherited from him.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.019
Those must be the genes
which have become stimulated.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.925
Too bad my great- grandfather
wasn't a little better- looking.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.935
Hmm. As far as l can tell,
his condition seems stable.

16:44.036 --> 16:46.061
l'm going to leave you
in charge of Sick Bay

16:46.138 --> 16:47.765
so l can continue
the DNA analysis.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.104
lf anyone else comes in,
l'll run a cellular scan.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.836
ls there anything else l can do?

16:51.910 --> 16:53.377
Do your best
to keep them comfortable.

16:53.445 --> 16:54.503
Until we have more information,

16:54.580 --> 16:56.138
that's the best
either of us can do.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.585
Thought you might be thirsty.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.357
Thanks.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.060
Do you smell something strange?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.601
l...l'm...

17:21.673 --> 17:23.834
l'm afraid that's me.

17:23.909 --> 17:26.241
l seem to be developing
Mylean sweat glands.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.368
Sorry.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.573
lt's not so bad.

17:29.648 --> 17:33.641
Well, whatever happens,
l...l try to keep in mind

17:33.719 --> 17:34.845
that things could be worse.

17:36.755 --> 17:39.622
l still have my home
here on Voyager,

17:39.691 --> 17:40.919
my friends...

17:40.993 --> 17:42.426
Your hair.

17:42.494 --> 17:45.088
True, but l'd gladly lose it

17:45.164 --> 17:48.463
if l could have
my taste buds back.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.503
At least you're not
losing your eyesight.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.130
See that display over there?

17:54.206 --> 17:56.868
lt's nothing but a blur.

17:56.942 --> 17:58.432
You think that's bad?

17:58.510 --> 18:01.946
The Doctor tells me my pupils
have dilated 60 percent.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.948
l can't even look at that
display, it's so bright.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.645
Yeah? Well, l've got
chronic arthritis in my fingers.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.687
l can barely
keep this glass steady.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.017
That's nothing.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.684
My spinal column
is fusing together.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.283
ln a matter of days,
l won't be able to walk.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.554
Got you beat.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.619
l can barely walk now.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.364
Lieutenant, can we help?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.423
l don't think so.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.026
l'm releasing you both
back to your quarters.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.733
l've just gotten reports
of more patients on the way.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.638
lt's going
to get crowded in here.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.004
How's the scanner?

18:32.077 --> 18:33.305
Almost ready.

18:33.378 --> 18:35.869
Good. This disorder seems
to be spreading rapidly

18:35.948 --> 18:36.915
among the crew.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.574
Does that mean
we'll all be affected?

18:38.650 --> 18:39.844
Right now, it only means
that we need

18:39.918 --> 18:42.113
to find some answers
as quickly as possible.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.654
All right.
Give the scanner a try.

18:43.722 --> 18:45.087
l'll start
with Commander Chakotay.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.752
How's the resolution?

18:49.828 --> 18:50.920
Very nice.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.429
Now, let's focus in
on the hyper- stimulated

18:53.499 --> 18:54.659
segments of his DNA.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.928
Can you give me
more magnification?

18:57.002 --> 18:58.526
Coming up.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.107
That's odd.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.199
What is?

19:04.276 --> 19:06.676
There seems to be
some kind of contaminant

19:06.745 --> 19:08.178
on the base pair sequence.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.579
lt didn't show up
on the first scan.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.844
l need a closer look.

19:12.918 --> 19:16.217
l'm going to maximum
magnification.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.024
What do you see?

19:25.097 --> 19:27.531
l'm not exactly sure.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.089
Well, what does it look like?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.564
See for yourself.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.735
l'm no microbiologist, but...

19:38.810 --> 19:40.744
that doesn't look
like it belongs there.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.336
Believe me, it doesn't.

19:42.414 --> 19:43.745
l've never seen
anything like it.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.476
This level
of submolecular technology

19:45.551 --> 19:47.781
is well beyond anything
Starfleet has developed.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.684
What are those markings?

19:49.755 --> 19:53.247
Some kind of alien writing?

19:53.325 --> 19:55.020
l wish l knew.

19:55.093 --> 19:57.459
They might help us
determine where it came from.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.429
But who could have put this
into Chakotay's cells

19:59.498 --> 20:00.465
without his knowledge?

20:03.835 --> 20:05.826
Let me try
a compositional analysis.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.943
lt's in Mr. Neelix's DNA
as well.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.815
ls this what's causing
the mutations?

20:21.887 --> 20:25.084
A good scientist never jumps
to conclusions, Lieutenant,

20:25.157 --> 20:27.785
but l'd say
it's a distinct possibility.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.519
l'm having trouble getting a
clear reading from this sample.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.566
lt looks almost like the, um--
whatever it is--

20:34.633 --> 20:36.794
could be slightly out of phase.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.500
That must be why my initial
scans didn't reveal it.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.700
l'm compensating
for the phase variance.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.369
You're not going
to believe this,

20:47.446 --> 20:49.437
but l'm picking up
an energy signature.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.415
This thing is transmitting
some kind of a signal.

20:52.484 --> 20:54.349
- To where?
- l don't know.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.148
lt's too weak
to travel very far.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.547
Access the internal sensors

20:59.625 --> 21:02.185
and set them
to a phase variance of. 15.

21:02.294 --> 21:03.318
Right.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.625
Lieutenant.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.570
Your program is being deleted.

21:12.638 --> 21:13.570
How?

21:13.639 --> 21:14.606
l don't know.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.265
l'm transferring you
back to Sick Bay.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.246
B'Elanna...

21:23.315 --> 21:24.304
Science Lab to the Bridge.

21:24.383 --> 21:25.350
This is the Doctor.

21:37.062 --> 21:39.223
ln the last hour,
three more patients have come in

21:39.298 --> 21:40.731
with genetic mutations.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.994
The effects are starting
to become life- threatening.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.228
What happened to B'Elanna?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.861
The alveoli in her lungs

21:45.937 --> 21:47.427
suddenly stopped
processing oxygen.

21:47.506 --> 21:48.973
l've got her
on respiratory support.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.202
She almost died.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.369
What about the Doctor?

21:53.445 --> 21:55.037
The computer logs
in the Science Lab

21:55.113 --> 21:57.581
show that he was trying
to transfer himself to Sick Bay.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.140
Something must have gone wrong
while he was in transit.

22:00.218 --> 22:01.412
Could the Doctor's program...?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.454
Seven of Nine,
this is the Doctor.

22:03.522 --> 22:04.921
Can you hear me?

22:05.023 --> 22:06.854
lt's me, the Doctor.

22:06.925 --> 22:09.018
l've tapped
into your audio implants

22:09.094 --> 22:11.153
so only you can hear me.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.322
lt's imperative
that you tell no one.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.525
Make any excuse
to get out of there

22:15.600 --> 22:17.158
and report to Holodeck 2.

22:17.235 --> 22:19.362
l'm hiding
in the da Vinci simulation.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.201
l'll explain everything
when you get here.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.501
Seven was checking that.

22:22.574 --> 22:23.905
Seven?

22:24.910 --> 22:25.934
Seven?

22:27.913 --> 22:30.143
About the Doctor's research.

22:30.215 --> 22:33.946
Yes. l examined their work area.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.816
There was no record
of any findings.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.583
The electron resonance scanner
appeared to be malfunctioning.

22:38.657 --> 22:41.990
l...could return
to the Science Lab

22:42.060 --> 22:43.459
and attempt to repair it.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.496
Keep me informed.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.629
Hold your head this way,
Carlotta.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.400
l can only conclude
that someone has implanted

22:55.474 --> 22:57.908
these microscopic tags
in the DNA of the crew

22:57.976 --> 22:59.603
to cause genetic mutations.

22:59.678 --> 23:00.610
For what purpose?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.270
l don't know,
and l get the feeling

23:02.314 --> 23:03.713
they don't want us to find out.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.443
Explain.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.451
When Lieutenant Torres
and l started making progress

23:07.519 --> 23:10.750
in our investigation,
we were both incapacitated.

23:10.822 --> 23:11.754
Call me paranoid,

23:11.823 --> 23:13.450
but l don't think
that is a coincidence.

23:13.525 --> 23:14.822
lf you're correct,

23:14.893 --> 23:16.588
perhaps our actions
are being monitored.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.822
That's why l couldn't risk
contacting anyone

23:18.897 --> 23:19.886
over the com system.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.398
Our first course of action

23:21.466 --> 23:23.661
should be to collect
more information.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.726
My thinking exactly.

23:25.804 --> 23:29.934
B'Elanna wanted to adjust
the ship's internal sensors

23:30.041 --> 23:32.771
to a phase variance of. 15.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.642
l'd like to do the same
to your Borg sensory nodes.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.341
Proceed.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.716
Computer, give me
a type- 4 micro- inducer.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.321
Hmm.

23:51.163 --> 23:54.826
Now, take a look around,
and tell me what you see.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.732
Do you see anything...

24:01.840 --> 24:03.899
unusual?

24:03.942 --> 24:06.103
Energy signatures...

24:06.178 --> 24:10.706
or perhaps something that might
be transmitting a signal?

24:14.019 --> 24:15.316
No.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.445
That's one room down,

24:16.521 --> 24:18.386
256 to go.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.015
l suggest a deck- by- deck survey.

24:20.091 --> 24:22.889
lf you need to contact me,
use com frequency Epsilon 2.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.724
l've isolated it
from the rest of the system.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.491
Understood.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.892
And be careful.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.129
Someone out there
could be watching.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.176
Deck 5.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.905
Computer, frequency Epsilon 2.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.772
Doctor, the aliens
are here on the ship.

26:18.843 --> 26:20.743
l can see them everywhere.

26:20.812 --> 26:22.473
This is worse than l imagined.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.276
You've got
to let the Captain know.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.664
Yes? Yes?

26:46.538 --> 26:47.527
Good morning, Captain.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.937
That's a matter of opinion.

26:49.007 --> 26:49.974
What is it?

26:50.041 --> 26:51.941
lnternal scans haven't revealed
anything

26:52.010 --> 26:53.375
about the genetic mutations.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.377
The Doctor?

26:54.446 --> 26:55.743
Still off- line.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.145
We are investigating
the possibility...

26:57.215 --> 26:58.978
lnform me of any progress.

26:59.050 --> 27:00.677
Understood.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.275
There's one more thing.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.220
The incident
with Tom and B'Elanna

27:04.289 --> 27:06.621
started me thinking
about ship's protocol

27:06.691 --> 27:08.750
or lack thereof.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.089
Captain?

27:10.161 --> 27:11.958
lt seems to me that people
have been getting

27:12.030 --> 27:13.861
a little too comfortable
around here lately.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.593
They're late
for their duty shifts,

27:15.667 --> 27:18.864
taking Mess Hall privileges
during non- designated hours

27:18.937 --> 27:21.167
and a lot of people are spending
more time on the holodeck

27:21.239 --> 27:22.365
than they are at their posts.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.135
You are Security Chief.

27:24.209 --> 27:27.906
Don't 13 department heads
report to you every day?

27:27.979 --> 27:28.911
Yes.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.379
Well, straighten them out.

27:31.716 --> 27:34.082
Shall l flog them as well?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.550
Maybe the Doctor was right.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.389
l think l do need a vacation.

27:43.461 --> 27:45.361
You do seem unsettled.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.591
Crazed is more like it.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.601
l haven't felt this anxious
since my first day of command.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.601
Remind me to lower
the volume on that door.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.696
Come in.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.474
Captain, l wish to speak
with you...

28:00.845 --> 28:02.642
What's wrong?

28:04.716 --> 28:07.810
My attempts to repair the
resonance scanner have failed.

28:07.886 --> 28:09.251
l require assistance.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.517
Ask Ensign Kim
to lend you a hand.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.287
Yes, Captain.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.694
ls that all?

28:26.504 --> 28:28.062
When this mutation crisis

28:28.139 --> 28:30.300
is over, l think
l'll spend a few days

28:30.375 --> 28:32.605
in Renaissance Tuscany.

28:32.677 --> 28:35.339
There's a little inn
outside Sienna

28:35.413 --> 28:36.903
l've been wanting to try.

28:43.088 --> 28:46.455
l will join you
for a glass of wine.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.201
How many?

29:04.275 --> 29:06.140
l've observed 56 of the aliens.

29:06.211 --> 29:07.644
There could be more.

29:07.712 --> 29:10.146
Have you seen any pattern
to their behavior,

29:10.215 --> 29:12.843
any hint as to what they're
trying to accomplish?

29:12.917 --> 29:15.215
They seem to be conducting
experiments on the crew

29:15.286 --> 29:16.753
and monitoring the results.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.950
As if Voyager were
one big petri dish.

29:22.026 --> 29:23.391
l may be among them.

29:23.461 --> 29:25.861
ln the turbolift, one of them

29:25.930 --> 29:28.455
probed me
with a medical instrument.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.660
We cannot allow them
to continue.

29:30.735 --> 29:34.136
l've been analyzing
their energy signatures.

29:34.205 --> 29:36.139
l believe there's a way

29:36.207 --> 29:37.674
to make them visible
to everyone.

29:37.742 --> 29:38.731
How?

29:38.810 --> 29:41.370
Using a precisely modulated
phaser beam.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.347
lf we expose them, the crew
may be able to fight back.

29:44.415 --> 29:45.814
But what if the aliens
retaliate

29:45.884 --> 29:48.250
by inflicting lethal mutations
on everyone?

29:48.319 --> 29:49.286
lt's too risky.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.288
What do you suggest?

29:53.758 --> 29:56.192
The key to the aliens' control
is the genetic tags.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.923
l believe a neuroleptic shock
would disable them.

29:59.030 --> 30:01.498
Unfortunately, it would be
rather...painful.

30:01.566 --> 30:03.329
Will the crew recover?

30:03.401 --> 30:05.494
Yes, they will.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.697
The hard part
will be administering the shock

30:07.772 --> 30:10.070
to everyone simultaneously.

30:10.141 --> 30:13.110
The power relays could be
reconfigured to do it.

30:13.178 --> 30:15.510
Good. l assume
you know how to do that?

30:15.580 --> 30:17.275
You assume correctly.

30:17.348 --> 30:19.976
But l will have to bypass
several safeguards.

30:20.051 --> 30:20.983
lt will take time.

30:21.085 --> 30:22.814
Then you'd better get started.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.421
Tuvok to Seven of Nine.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.479
Yes?

31:00.592 --> 31:02.958
Why have you accessed
the EPS relay system?

31:03.027 --> 31:04.722
There is a malfunction.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.263
l'm attempting to repair it.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.595
Perhaps you should leave that
to the Engineering crew.

31:08.666 --> 31:09.894
Normally, l would.

31:09.968 --> 31:13.096
However, they are all occupied
with other tasks.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.639
You are compromising
the power safety protocols.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.265
Stop what you're doing at once.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.708
l assure you, there is
no cause for concern.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.882
Move away from the console.

31:37.462 --> 31:40.397
As l told you,
l am conducting repairs.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.956
You are attempting
to deceive me. Why?

31:48.806 --> 31:50.205
l can't explain what l'm doing,

31:50.275 --> 31:51.708
but you must allow me
to continue.

31:51.776 --> 31:54.267
Your actions could result
in an energy discharge,

31:54.345 --> 31:56.040
which would be
harmful to the crew.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.741
l realize that.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.049
Don't move.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.660
lf your people attempt
to incapacitate me,

32:13.731 --> 32:15.130
l will kill you.

32:15.199 --> 32:16.962
l believe you.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.128
What do you intend to do now?

32:21.205 --> 32:23.833
You will come with me
to speak to the Captain.

32:23.908 --> 32:26.843
l am certain she will have
questions for you.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.683
Keep on trying
to disable the tags.

32:34.752 --> 32:35.810
Let me know when you're ready.

32:35.887 --> 32:36.819
Understood.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.822
l'll attempt to modify
the internal sensors

32:38.890 --> 32:40.221
to detect the aliens.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.258
Good.

32:41.326 --> 32:42.816
Keep me informed.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.508
Who are you?

32:57.575 --> 33:01.636
And what the hell
are you doing to my crew?

33:01.713 --> 33:04.841
My team has been observing you
and conducting tests.

33:04.916 --> 33:05.848
Tests?

33:05.917 --> 33:08.283
l'd call them mutilations.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.844
l can understand
why you're angry.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.822
l don't like causing
people to suffer,

33:12.890 --> 33:16.291
but sometimes it's
a necessary part of my work.

33:16.361 --> 33:17.885
What kind of work is that?

33:17.962 --> 33:19.395
Medical research.

33:19.464 --> 33:22.194
We're scientists, like you.

33:22.266 --> 33:26.202
From where l stand,
you're a hostile invasion force.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.431
l want to know
how long you've been here

33:28.506 --> 33:31.373
and exactly what
you've been doing to us.

33:31.442 --> 33:33.239
l can't answer those questions.

33:33.311 --> 33:34.972
lt's a breach of protocol

33:35.079 --> 33:36.979
for me to be speaking
to you at all.

33:37.081 --> 33:39.174
Oh, how convenient.

33:41.085 --> 33:43.576
That way you never
have to face your victims.

33:43.654 --> 33:44.780
Captain, please.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.689
You're exaggerating
the situation.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.956
Our techniques are as benign
as we can make them.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.088
What l have been through
for the last few days

33:53.164 --> 33:55.257
certainly hasn't felt benign!

33:55.333 --> 33:58.666
Please understand that there's
a purpose to our actions.

33:58.736 --> 34:00.704
The data we gather from you

34:00.805 --> 34:03.774
may help us cure physical
and psychological disorders

34:03.808 --> 34:05.275
that afflict millions.

34:05.343 --> 34:08.335
lsn't that worth
some discomfort?

34:08.413 --> 34:10.277
l'm sure you'd see
things differently

34:10.348 --> 34:11.576
if your people were the ones

34:11.649 --> 34:14.083
being subjected
to these experiments.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.915
Just as your perspective
would change

34:15.987 --> 34:17.511
if your people were the ones

34:17.588 --> 34:20.181
to live longer
and healthier lives as a result.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.920
Don't forget, we've been
observing you, Captain.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.893
l know the most important
thing to you

34:24.962 --> 34:27.021
is the welfare of your crew.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.589
You'd even kill to protect them.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.601
lf necessary.

34:31.668 --> 34:32.931
Of course you would.

34:33.004 --> 34:36.063
You take care of your own,
just as we do.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.976
We're really more similar
than you care to admit.

34:42.045 --> 34:43.706
That's where you're wrong.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.210
What you're doing
isn't self- defense.

34:51.289 --> 34:54.621
lt's the exploitation
of another species

34:54.692 --> 34:56.181
for your own benefit.

34:56.260 --> 35:00.356
My people decided a long time
ago that that was unacceptable,

35:00.431 --> 35:03.594
even in the name
of scientific progress.

35:03.668 --> 35:07.104
You're a remarkably
strong- willed individual.

35:07.171 --> 35:10.106
l've been very impressed
by your self- control

35:10.174 --> 35:12.039
over the past several weeks.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.602
We've been increasing
your dopamine levels,

35:15.680 --> 35:17.807
stimulating various
aggressive impulses

35:17.882 --> 35:21.181
to test
your behavioral restraints.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.717
There's been a great
difference of opinion

35:24.789 --> 35:26.188
about how much more strain

35:26.257 --> 35:27.690
you can bear.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.092
Not much.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.763
l had hoped you might be
more cooperative

35:39.837 --> 35:41.930
once you realized
the importance of our work.

35:42.039 --> 35:42.937
Sorry.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.837
These lab rats
are fighting back.

35:44.909 --> 35:47.377
l'm afraid
that will be pointless.

35:47.445 --> 35:50.642
We're monitoring your attempts
to break our control over you.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.080
You won't succeed.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.482
Well, you may find that
you've underestimated us.

35:54.552 --> 35:57.146
Consider what's in the best
interests of your crew.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.855
We will be continuing
our research.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.153
lf you make no further attempts
to interfere, l assure you

36:03.194 --> 36:05.560
lf you make no further attempts
to interfere, l assure you

36:05.630 --> 36:08.292
that the fatality rate
will be minimal,

36:08.366 --> 36:11.130
though there may be
some deformities.

36:11.202 --> 36:15.138
And l would be willing to share
our final data with you.

36:15.206 --> 36:18.573
You can't possibly expect me
to accept that.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.634
lf you don't,

36:20.711 --> 36:23.475
then the entire experiment,
and its subjects

36:23.548 --> 36:24.913
will be terminated.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.157
Are you telling me

36:33.224 --> 36:35.089
there is no way
to disable the tags?

36:35.159 --> 36:37.024
My attempts to use
the EPS relays

36:37.094 --> 36:39.153
to induce neuroleptic shock
have failed.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.095
The aliens may be responsible.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.860
l've encountered
similar difficulties

36:42.934 --> 36:45.061
in my efforts to modify
the internal sensors.

36:45.136 --> 36:48.333
They appear to have gained
access to our key systems.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.465
They can't be everywhere
all the time.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.771
We have got to find
an advantage.

36:52.843 --> 36:54.105
We'd better find one soon.

36:54.178 --> 36:55.873
Sick Bay is being filled
with new patients

36:55.947 --> 36:57.574
with increasingly
severe symptoms.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.980
We have the ability
to make them visible.

37:00.017 --> 37:02.383
lf we could modify enough
sensors, we could resist them.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.116
They are still capable
of manipulating our DNA.

37:05.189 --> 37:07.248
A direct conflict
would be inadvisable.

37:07.325 --> 37:08.485
Bridge to Doctor.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.491
Medical emergency!

37:19.804 --> 37:21.294
She's in hypertensive shock.

37:21.372 --> 37:22.839
20 milligrams lectrazine.

37:22.907 --> 37:26.866
Her blood pressure is 360/125.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.707
How is that possible?

37:28.779 --> 37:30.178
Severe adrenal stress.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.478
No effect.

37:35.653 --> 37:37.780
Her arterial pathways
are rupturing.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.914
She's in cardiac arrest.
We're losing her.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.594
Captain, l'm afraid
that won't help.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.095
There's too much
internal bleeding.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.528
Then try something else.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.532
We'll transport her to Sick Bay.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.397
Her entire circulatory
system has collapsed.

37:51.469 --> 37:53.369
There's no way to repair
that kind of damage.

37:55.506 --> 37:57.303
Brain death has occurred.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.342
l'm sorry.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.899
There was nothing more
we could have done.

38:02.880 --> 38:06.008
This ends right now.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.846
You're relieved.

38:07.918 --> 38:10.785
Captain, what are you doing?

38:10.855 --> 38:13.323
l'm running a little
experiment of my own.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.688
Red Alert!

38:20.831 --> 38:23.493
Captain, one of the aliens
has just entered the Bridge.

38:23.567 --> 38:24.693
Understood.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.703
We're less than a million
kilometers from the pulsars.

38:26.771 --> 38:27.863
We must change course

38:27.938 --> 38:30.304
immediately to avoid being
caught in their gravity.

38:30.374 --> 38:31.841
No! Keep going.

38:31.909 --> 38:34.207
This is a far
more reckless course of action

38:34.278 --> 38:36.143
than l've come to expect
from you, Captain.

38:36.213 --> 38:37.646
lt certainly is.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.479
Hull stress is at 30 teradynes
and rising.

38:40.551 --> 38:41.643
l'm transferring more power

38:41.719 --> 38:42.913
to the structural
integrity field,

38:42.987 --> 38:44.477
but l don't know
how long it can hold.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.616
What do you hope
to accomplish by this?

38:47.692 --> 38:49.785
Flying into a binary pulsar?

38:49.860 --> 38:51.760
lt seems like l'm trying
to crush this ship

38:51.829 --> 38:53.228
like a tin can.

38:53.297 --> 38:54.229
lt's more likely

38:54.298 --> 38:55.822
that you're trying
to intimidate us.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.198
You're welcome
to stick around and find out.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.237
Hull stress is at 45 teradynes.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.070
Our course is locked in.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.610
Only my authorization
can release it.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.044
You're not behaving
very rationally.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.709
That's what you were trying
to accomplish, wasn't it? Hmm?

39:13.784 --> 39:16.480
Pumping up my dopamine levels
to push me to the edge?

39:16.554 --> 39:18.249
Keeping me awake
for four days straight

39:18.322 --> 39:20.017
with the constant pain
of your devices

39:20.091 --> 39:21.490
drilling into my skull?

39:21.559 --> 39:23.823
Well, this is the culmination
of your work, and guess what?

39:23.894 --> 39:26.488
You're going to be right here
to collect the final data.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.589
Shields have failed.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.725
Structural integrity is down
to 20 percent.

39:30.801 --> 39:33.770
Enter the authorization code
and change course immediately!

39:33.838 --> 39:34.770
l don't think you realize

39:34.839 --> 39:38.070
that you are not
in control here anymore.

39:38.142 --> 39:41.111
l can kill you and your crew
in an instant.

39:41.178 --> 39:42.304
Go ahead.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.315
Without us, you won't be able
to prevent this ship

39:45.383 --> 39:47.010
from being torn apart
by the pulsars.

39:47.084 --> 39:48.813
And even with my crew
working together,

39:48.886 --> 39:50.717
l'd say the odds of us
getting through this

39:50.788 --> 39:52.415
are what? One in ten?

39:52.490 --> 39:54.515
One in 20, at best, Captain.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.787
l'm willing to take that chance.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.351
Are you?

39:59.530 --> 40:02.499
Outer hull temperature
has reached 9, 000 degrees.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.999
The hull is beginning to buckle!

40:05.836 --> 40:09.033
Two alien vessels are attempting
to disengage from Voyager.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.981
l can't break us free
of the gravitational forces!

40:19.083 --> 40:21.881
Then let's divert all power
to the shields!

40:21.952 --> 40:24.079
No. lf we go in,
we go in full throttle.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.281
Captain?

40:25.356 --> 40:26.345
Assuming we survive,

40:26.424 --> 40:27.982
we're going to need
all the momentum we can get

40:28.058 --> 40:30.117
to reach escape velocity
on the other side.

40:30.194 --> 40:32.253
Everyone, hang on.

40:33.664 --> 40:34.631
l hope you were

40:34.698 --> 40:36.757
exaggerating
about those odds, Tuvok.

40:36.834 --> 40:38.392
l was not.

40:43.174 --> 40:46.041
Hull stress has exceeded
maximum tolerance!

40:46.143 --> 40:49.510
There are breaches
on Decks 4, 7, 8 and 12.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.514
Emergency force fields
are holding.

40:51.582 --> 40:53.607
l've lost helm control!

40:53.684 --> 40:55.345
Main power is off- line!

40:55.419 --> 40:57.478
Well, let's hope
we've got enough speed.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.123
l don't believe it.

41:11.202 --> 41:12.931
We're alive.

41:13.037 --> 41:17.633
l never realized you thought
of me as"reckless," Tuvok.

41:17.708 --> 41:20.142
A poor choice of words.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.771
lt was clearly
an understatement.

41:25.182 --> 41:29.141
Captain's Log, Stardate 51244. 3.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.780
With the aliens gone,
the Doctor has been able

41:31.856 --> 41:33.847
to remove their devices
from the crew

41:33.924 --> 41:36.154
and neutralize the genetic tags.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.296
lt was nice you could
get the night off.

41:40.364 --> 41:43.128
"Nice" had nothing
to do with it.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.327
l switched shifts
with Ensign Wildman,

41:45.402 --> 41:46.767
which means tomorrow

41:46.837 --> 41:49.601
l'll pull a double- duty
on the Bridge and with the Doc.

41:49.673 --> 41:52.437
Well, l appreciate
the sacrifice.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.343
Tell me about the wine.

41:55.412 --> 41:59.041
Ah, Ktarian merlot, 2282.
