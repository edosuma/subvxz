00:15.580 --> 00:17.756
OWEN:
Hey, welcome to
Bruin's Full Service Car Wash,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.541
where we make your car shine.
Now pull on up.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.847
Yeah, I'll just take
the express wash.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.502
Well, uh, you know, the best
is only, uh, five dollars more,

00:24.546 --> 00:26.026
and it covers the rainbow glaze.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.897
No, I'll just take
the express wash.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.552
Okay, but that won't include
the undercarriage.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.119
That's fine.Oh, and with the best,

00:32.162 --> 00:35.209
I can throw in our, uh,
premium air fresheners.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.385
You know, none of this cheesy
pine scent for a man of your...

00:37.428 --> 00:39.517
Pine scent is fine.Okay.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.867
But I promise you our Coco
Cabana scent will make it...

00:41.911 --> 00:44.305
Look, I don't want the Coco
Cabana or the undercarriage

00:44.348 --> 00:45.610
washed or the damn glaze.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.918
All I want is a simple wash.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.528
The express.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.617
Is that so hard to understand?!

00:52.661 --> 00:54.489
[chuckles]
The express, yeah, you got it.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.056
Um, I'll just meet you

00:56.099 --> 00:57.970
at the end of the tunnel

Well, no wonder. Looks like you
haven't emptied your mailbox

02:15.526 --> 02:18.050
in, like, a month.Two weeks.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.401

done my laundry yet either.

I have mail to sort through.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.591
I use a shredder instead.

more efficient.

Oh, wait.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.422
I think these are
from that, uh,

02:41.465 --> 02:42.988
wedding you went to
last month.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.165
Actual paper photos.

Ooh, interesting
photos, too.

she's old-school. She likes...

02:49.169 --> 02:51.519
paper photos
and thank-you notes.

02:51.562 --> 02:52.824
Yeah, no, it looks like, uh,

02:52.868 --> 02:54.391
looks like you and Jimmy
had a fun time.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.611
Wow, let me see?

02:56.654 --> 02:58.003
It was all right.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.223
Oh, I don't know,
with these big, bright smiles,

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
it says that you
had more than

03:02.269 --> 03:03.661
an "all right" time.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.142
Guys?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.057
It was a wedding. Cold food,

03:08.100 --> 03:11.016
mediocre music,
happy tears, the usual.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.062
I don't know, I think
there's more to the story.What are you,

03:13.105 --> 03:14.281
a psychic now?Just reading the room.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.196
You do seem agitated.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.458
What?What happened?

03:17.501 --> 03:19.242
You get wasted?
[gasps]

03:19.286 --> 03:20.852
You caught the bouquet?

03:20.896 --> 03:22.854
Jimmy step on your toes
while you two were dancing?

03:22.898 --> 03:23.942
[laughs]

03:23.986 --> 03:25.596
It has something to do
with Jimmy!

03:25.640 --> 03:28.120
Wrong. Give me these.

03:28.164 --> 03:30.035
Where is Parker anyway?

03:30.079 --> 03:31.733
HR. He's, uh, reveling

03:31.776 --> 03:33.430
in some more
leadership training.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.866
And you're changing
the subject.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.564
You know, Dr. Grace says
that's a defense mechanism.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.000
Mm.Nick?

03:38.043 --> 03:39.523
I get my own dose of Dr. Grace.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.046
I don't need yours, too.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.701
Just saying, you'd feel much
better if you talk about it.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.313
There is nothing to talk about.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.184
[phone chiming]Oh, look, Parker.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.491
Got a body. Let's go.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.015
Classic avoidance.Mm.

03:57.019 --> 04:00.152
I mean, I've seen dozens
of dead bodies before.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.807
Well, on-on TV. I mean,
they say the first 48 hours

04:02.851 --> 04:04.940
are crucial
to catching a killer.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.333
That's right.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.465
Now, you're sure there was
no one else in the van?

04:08.509 --> 04:10.337
No, no, he was completely alone.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.208
And totally grouchy,
if you ask me.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.645
What makes you say that?Oh, I'm very observant.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.604
I mean, that's important
if you want to be a cop, right?

04:16.647 --> 04:18.649
I'm still weighing
all my options, but...

04:18.693 --> 04:20.434
I think I'd make a good one,
you know?

04:21.565 --> 04:24.264
Morning, Jimmy. Body's in the
van if you want to get started.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.874
Yeah, sure.
Um, hey, Jess, um...

04:25.917 --> 04:28.006
you're somewhat
of a coffee connoisseur, right?

04:28.050 --> 04:30.400
Well, I wouldn't call
myself that, but...

04:30.444 --> 04:32.750
I do know my arabicas
from my robustas.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.274
Well, uh, there's a new place

04:34.317 --> 04:35.797
that just opened up
a couple blocks from work.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.494
They name their drinks
after celebrities.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.366
You know, like,
like Al Cappuccino...

04:39.409 --> 04:42.151
or Elvis Presso.
[chuckles]

04:43.195 --> 04:45.285
I thought maybe you might want
to check it out later?

04:45.328 --> 04:48.113
Yeah, sounds great.
I'll let the guys know.

04:48.157 --> 04:51.073
The guys. Yeah, yeah...

04:52.248 --> 04:54.598
Wait, wait, did you mean,
did you mean just...

04:54.642 --> 04:55.599
just the two of us?

04:55.643 --> 04:56.861
No, no, no, no. Yes,

04:56.905 --> 04:58.428
that's what I meant,
but it's okay...

04:58.472 --> 04:59.908
I didn't realize...PARKER:
Where are we at

04:59.951 --> 05:01.475
with the body?Uh, uh, right over here.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.563
Mm-hmm.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.826
Nothing to talk about, huh?

05:04.869 --> 05:07.437
Navy Reservist John Murphy, 35.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.786
Just finished
drill weekend.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.527
TORRES:
He must've driven over a skunk.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.007
Because the van still stinks.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.444
KNIGHT:
Went into the tunnel alive,
came out dead.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.751
No murder weapon
and, uh, no sign of struggle.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.796
McGEE: And no water inside
the van, which means the...

05:18.840 --> 05:20.450
doors and windows were
shut the entire time.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.323
Like a locked-room mystery.
How'd the killer get inside?

05:23.366 --> 05:24.585
Maybe he didn't have to.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.195
I mean, there's
no external wounds here.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.632
So where'd the blood come from?If I had to guess...

05:28.676 --> 05:30.678
I'd say it was hematemesis.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.115
Right, in English, uh...

05:33.158 --> 05:34.725
he vomited the blood.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.598
I'm sorry I asked.Hematemesis this bad
is usually caused

05:37.641 --> 05:39.861
by some kind of poison, so
we'll have to run a tox screen

05:39.904 --> 05:41.906
to figure out which kind.McGEE:
All right, thanks.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.778
Okay, we got a hit
on the plate.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.823
Van came from a
rental company.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.912
What's Murphy doing with it?

05:47.956 --> 05:50.045
Uh, I think I might
have an idea.

05:55.572 --> 05:58.967
What's a Navy reservist doing
with a bunch of slot machines?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.664
I don't know,
but whatever it was...

06:00.708 --> 06:02.536
Who wants to finish
that sentence?

06:03.754 --> 06:05.713
Looks like his luck ran out.

06:05.756 --> 06:06.888
Mm.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.593
McGEE:
John Murphy.
Investigative journalist

06:16.637 --> 06:19.683
and Navy Reservist.
Widowed last year; no kids.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.511
After a tour in Iraq,
he wrote a piece

06:21.555 --> 06:24.775
on how our servicemen
cope with post-traumatic stress.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.864
It got him a job
as a reporter

06:26.908 --> 06:28.344
with the Navy Herald.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.389
And reporters chase controversy.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.651
Could've made him a target.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.043
Except he's not
a reporter anymore.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.654
He was fired
three weeks ago.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.220
We know why?

06:35.264 --> 06:36.613
What about the slot machines?
Where'd he get them?

06:36.657 --> 06:38.702
Still working on it.
Kasie says that they're, uh,

06:38.746 --> 06:41.662
supposed to have GPS trackers
attached, but they are missing.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.533
We suspect the machines
were stolen.

06:43.577 --> 06:44.795
The question is why.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.101
Why else? To make money.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.711
Tim, may I?Yeah.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.496
So it looks like Murphy
has a cash-flow problem.

06:49.539 --> 06:52.063
His house is in foreclosure,
big credit card debt,

06:52.107 --> 06:54.370
and he hasn't paid
his car loan in months.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.111
Maybe he went
into business for himself.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.505
Running an illegal
gambling operation?

06:58.548 --> 07:01.421
From a rental van?McGee, Torres,
talk to his old boss.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.858
Find out why he was fired.
Knight, the slots.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.686
Where'd they come from?
Where were they going?

07:05.729 --> 07:07.470
And Palmer...

07:07.514 --> 07:09.559
I was just about to
come down and check in.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.388
But looks like we got
an urgent update.Uh, urgent, yes. Update, no.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.911
I-I've got to sneak away
for a couple hours.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.653
Not to worry though, Dr. Mallard
said he'd fill in for me.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.568
Everything all right?Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.440
I-I just got
an emergency call request

07:20.483 --> 07:23.747
from a volunteer medical network
I joined after Breena died.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.314
Uh, we help to deliver

07:25.357 --> 07:27.795
organs to patients
who are awaiting transplants.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.013
Oh, that's great, Jimmy, nice.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.798
JIMMY: Yeah, yeah,
my-my part in it

07:30.841 --> 07:32.974
is pretty small, you know?
I basically pick an organ up

07:33.017 --> 07:35.542
from one hospital,
I deliver it to another.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.326
Why are you so nervous, man?
You got this.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.850
It's my first time.
What if there's traffic?

07:39.894 --> 07:42.070
Well, I'm sure the hospital
accounts for that.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.159
Of course, but, you guys...

07:44.202 --> 07:47.249
I'll just say it.
I'm not a strong navigator.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.946
You know, if I take
a wrong turn,

07:48.990 --> 07:50.557
I could end up
losing precious minutes.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.602
You know, protocol says that
one person should drive

07:52.646 --> 07:54.604
while another person
monitors the organ.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.867
I'm flying solo on this one,
so who's gonna monitor

07:56.911 --> 07:59.130
the organ if I get a flat tire?

07:59.174 --> 08:00.871
TORRES:
Okay, so sir, we have plenty

08:00.915 --> 08:03.483
of hands on this case.
Maybe we can spare one?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.006
I'll go.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.312
I mean...

08:07.356 --> 08:10.141
unless you were trying
to volunteer, Nick?

08:10.185 --> 08:11.491
Not at all.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.192
Aw, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
[chuckles]

08:17.235 --> 08:20.064
This does not go
next to the scalpels.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.153
It goes here.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.634
Uh, sorry
for interrupting.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.549
I guess you're on a phone?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.986
But I don't see
a Bluetooth headset.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.814
I-I like to be wired.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.251
Then you're talking to...?

08:33.295 --> 08:34.992
Mr. Murphy, of course.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.603
Of course.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.866
I assume he told you
what killed him.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.258
He did.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.826
Arsenic,
a most popular means

08:42.870 --> 08:45.220
of murder
in the 18th century.

08:45.263 --> 08:48.179
It was often used
to resolve matters

08:48.223 --> 08:49.529
of family inheritance.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.313
Oh, Murphy didn't
have a family,

08:51.356 --> 08:53.358
or a dime to his name.
And haven't I read

08:53.402 --> 08:55.535
that arsenic
takes weeks to kill?

08:55.578 --> 08:57.972
You're recalling
Agatha Christie.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.756
I sometimes fancy myself

08:59.800 --> 09:01.671
a modern-day Hercule Poirot.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.891
Arsenic doesn't
necessarily take weeks.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.197
As with any poisonous substance,

09:06.241 --> 09:08.286
the amount administered

09:08.330 --> 09:10.593
determines the speed of death.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.855
And in Murphy's case?

09:11.899 --> 09:13.988
Kacie found more
than 300 milligrams

09:14.031 --> 09:15.598
in his blood.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.209
That suggests
that he was poisoned,

09:18.253 --> 09:20.342
oh, but a few
hours before

09:20.385 --> 09:21.604
he arrived at the car wash.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.171
Nah, that could've come
from anywhere.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.955
Buying arsenic
off the Internet's

09:24.999 --> 09:27.044
as easy as getting milk
from the store.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.830
I don't suppose
you could ask Mr. Murphy

09:29.873 --> 09:31.222
who wanted him dead?

09:31.266 --> 09:32.876
[chuckles]
Uh, you'll have

09:32.920 --> 09:34.878
to answer that one for yourself,

09:34.922 --> 09:37.141
Monsieur Poirot.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.404
[chuckles]

09:39.448 --> 09:41.145
Now, you called Mar Vista--
they're expecting

09:41.189 --> 09:42.277
the organ, right?Yes, Doctor.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.321
Okay, good, good, good.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.193
Uh, Dr. Scott Long?

09:45.236 --> 09:48.762
Oh, you must be our chaperones.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.591
Uh, Jimmy Palmer and...

09:51.634 --> 09:53.505
Jessica Knight.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.944
Hmm, Knight with a K.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.381
An apt name
for a guardian angel.

09:59.424 --> 10:02.036
Will you protect this liver
with your life,

10:02.079 --> 10:03.907
Jessica?

10:03.951 --> 10:05.343
Well...No, I'm kidding.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.823
I'm kidding.
[laughs]

10:06.867 --> 10:08.608
[both laugh]

10:08.651 --> 10:11.349
No, you'll be transporting
a cooler like this one

10:11.393 --> 10:13.308
to Mar Vista Hospital
three hours away.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.615
When was the organ harvested?Two hours ago.

10:15.658 --> 10:18.095
And the liver can be kept
on ice for nine hours, so...

10:18.139 --> 10:20.315
So we can stop for a burger.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.101
I'm kidding.It's important

10:24.145 --> 10:25.625
that you take this seriously,
Jessica.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.192
Of course.I can go for a burger, too.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.716
[laughing]:
Right?

10:29.759 --> 10:32.022
Maybe we should focus on
saving a person's life first.

10:32.066 --> 10:35.591
Um, anything we should know?The recipient's been waiting
a long time for a liver.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.115
Due to her blood type, it's been
difficult to find a match.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.508
We barely found this in time.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.857
Let's not keep her waiting.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.380
I like your spunk.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.121
I need you both to sign here.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.123
And I'll get the organ.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.647
[exhales]

10:47.690 --> 10:49.431
Jess, I'm really
glad you're here.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.954
I feel like we haven't
talked in a while.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.739
Really?
We talk every day at work.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.480
Yeah, well, you know,
you're always in such a rush.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.179
It's actually why I invited you
out for coffee earlier.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.268
I know, I'm s-- I'm sorry.

11:00.311 --> 11:03.140
I didn't realize
that you meant just you and me.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.055
No worries, no, no.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.448
Six-hour round trip, you know.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.232
It'll give us
plenty of one-on-one time.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.017
SCOTT:
Here we are!

11:11.975 --> 11:14.108
Here we go-- oh!
[laughs]

11:14.151 --> 11:16.676
[laughs]Okay.
Okay.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.330
Let's go. Uh, my car's

11:19.374 --> 11:21.506
in the shop,
so you'll need to drive.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.291
Wait, what?You're coming, too.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.728
Well, protocol requires
that a hospital liaison

11:25.772 --> 11:28.296
accompany the organ
from donor to recipient.

11:28.339 --> 11:29.732
I must've missed that part.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.342
Is that a problem?

11:31.386 --> 11:34.171
No, no, it's... not at all.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.999
Right, Jimmy?

11:36.043 --> 11:38.436
[chuckles]
The more, the merrier.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.873
Great.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.526
I get shotgun!

11:41.570 --> 11:42.963
[laughter]

11:43.006 --> 11:45.443
You bet.Great.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.707
[chiming]

11:47.750 --> 11:49.447
Ooh.

11:49.491 --> 11:52.233
Come on, you stupid machine.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.322
I don't understand why people
like this kind of thing.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.716
I mean, yes, I guess
the flashing lights are

11:56.759 --> 11:58.152
kind of pretty, but...

11:58.195 --> 12:00.850
Yeah, but you can't stop
pulling on that bar.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.374
Help me.Okay, well, you said

12:03.418 --> 12:06.029
that we had something,
you know, about the case.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.857
Oh, yes, oh, the case, yes.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.467
Yes, the case.
[chuckles]

12:09.511 --> 12:11.731
I know where Murphy stole
the slot machines from.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.602
A Navy base.

12:13.645 --> 12:17.171
Wait, since when does the Navy
have slot machines on bases?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.738
Oh, well the machines
are actually owned

12:18.781 --> 12:20.348
by an MWR contractor.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.742
Morale, Welfare
and Recreation.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.614
But MWR has been
operating slot machines

12:25.657 --> 12:27.834
on bases since the 1930s.

12:27.877 --> 12:30.227
These babies were being
shipped for repair

12:30.271 --> 12:31.751
and were gonna be sent
back to their bases.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.101
Why would he steal them
from the Navy?

12:34.144 --> 12:35.798
Oh, well, he wasn't
stealing them exactly.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.539
Just borrowing them.

12:37.582 --> 12:40.716
Okay, why would you borrow
a slot machine?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.763
Good question
and I have a good answer.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.852
I took a look under the hood.

12:45.895 --> 12:49.594
It looks like Murphy tampered
with the CPU code.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.249
For every dollar played,
a portion was being

12:52.293 --> 12:55.165
siphoned off
to a secret offshore account.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.298
So he hacked the machines
and was gonna put them

12:57.341 --> 12:59.169
back into circulation.Yeah.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.911
The DoD makes over $100 million

13:01.955 --> 13:04.131
a year on slots alone.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.046
So he stood
to cash in big.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.135
Unfortunately for Murphy...

13:08.178 --> 13:10.877
Has someone already made
the "his luck run out" joke?

13:10.920 --> 13:12.269
Yep.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.923
Yeah, well, I still have
to process his laptop,

13:13.967 --> 13:16.099
so looks like for now,

13:16.143 --> 13:17.797
I'm all out of chips.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.624
Okay.Ooh, give it to me.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.410
All right, I kind
of like that one.Hey!

13:26.849 --> 13:28.938
Hey, thanks again
for letting me ride shotgun,

13:28.982 --> 13:30.418
Jimmy.
You know, I-I get car sick

13:30.461 --> 13:32.246
just even thinking
about the backseat.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.988
No problem. No problem at all.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.820
Don't tell me you surf,
Jessica.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.212
[chuckles]

13:42.256 --> 13:43.910
Uh, guilty.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.389
[laughs]

13:45.433 --> 13:47.304
I didn't know that.Well, it's been a while.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.480
But I picked it up again
when I went to Oahu last month.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.831
You know, I-I'm planning
a trip to Jeffreys Bay.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.616
Oh.That is definitely
a surfer's haven, right?

13:54.659 --> 13:55.835
You surf, Jimmy?

13:55.878 --> 13:59.316
I took my daughter
boogie-boarding once.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.145
Never too late
to give it a try, right?

14:02.189 --> 14:03.494
Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't mind
learning.

14:03.538 --> 14:07.063
Just need to...
find a good teacher.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.587
What the...?Jess, watch out!

14:09.631 --> 14:11.111
[tire blows]

14:12.895 --> 14:14.723
[panting]

14:15.855 --> 14:18.292
Jimmy, you okay?Yeah.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.728
[gunshots][gasps]

14:22.731 --> 14:23.863
No! No, no, no, no!

14:23.906 --> 14:25.386
Not that side!Scott!

14:25.429 --> 14:26.691
[grunts]

14:26.735 --> 14:28.215
[gunshot]

14:33.089 --> 14:34.699
[gunfire continues]No, no, no, no!

14:35.526 --> 14:38.181
He's gone.
If we stay here, we are, too.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.749
[grunts]
Okay, uh...

14:40.792 --> 14:43.012
Over there.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.102
Okay, you go. I got you covered.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.757
Okay.Okay. Now!

14:58.114 --> 15:00.421
TORRES: The slot machines
Murphy had in his van

15:00.464 --> 15:02.814
were stationed at
a Navy base in Japan.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.469
Vega Gaming is
the D.C.-based MWR

15:05.513 --> 15:07.036
contractor that services them.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.342
They were on their way
back for service

15:08.385 --> 15:09.560
when Murphy
grabbed them.

15:09.604 --> 15:10.648
No one noticed
they were missing.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.128
What was Murphy's cut?

15:12.172 --> 15:13.173
Uh, one penny on the dollar.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.914
Funneled to an offshore account.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.741
With enough machines, he could
clear a million bucks a year.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.004
That's a hell of a retirement.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.831
Slot machine software is
pretty complex.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.833
Murphy didn't have
the skills to do that.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.140
Not without help, at least,
and it looks like

15:24.184 --> 15:25.576
he had a partner.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.449
I pulled a bunch
of emails off his laptop.

15:28.492 --> 15:29.972
He was pretty tight

15:30.016 --> 15:32.409
with a software engineer
from Vega Gaming.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.584
Ana Brooks.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.151
Murphy's partner was an insider.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.023
Oh, they weren't gonna be
partners much longer.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.459
She wanted out.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.722
It sounds like Ana
thought someone at Vega

15:40.765 --> 15:43.203
was getting suspicious,
but Murphy kept

15:43.246 --> 15:44.813
pressuring her
to keep going.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.858
Maybe he pressured her
a little too much.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.731
And she dissolved
the partnership.Pick her up.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.740
I haven't heard anybody
behind us for a while now.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.003
Yeah, we should call someone.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.312
My phone's dead.
It's broken.

16:05.355 --> 16:06.922
Can we use yours?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.880
We had it up
for navigation in the car.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.056
I left it there.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.928
I can't believe
we just left Scott behind.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.713
Okay, we can't focus
on that right now.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.063
Who were those guys?

16:17.106 --> 16:19.021
Uh, I don't know.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.023
But the only thing you and I
have in common right now

16:21.067 --> 16:22.982
is that organ, so I have
a hunch they're after that.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.549
We got about six hours to get
this liver to the hospital

16:25.593 --> 16:27.116
before the recipient dies.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.118
Okay, well, first we have
to get out of here alive.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.033
Let's circle back to the main
road, we'll flag down a car...

16:31.077 --> 16:32.730
That's too dangerous.
I'm sure those shooters

16:32.774 --> 16:34.254
left men behind
in case we came back.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.559
Okay, then what do we do?

16:35.603 --> 16:37.039
We go north.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.562
We passed a highway
ten miles back.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.086
We can flag somebody down
from there.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.218
Ten miles? This
organ isn't gonna make...Six hours

16:42.262 --> 16:44.742
is enough time. We can make it
to the hospital, I promise.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.788
Okay.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.053
McGEE:
Ms. Brooks?

16:51.097 --> 16:52.924
NCIS!

16:52.968 --> 16:55.579
Okay, so you've never
gambled before?

16:55.623 --> 16:57.929
No, no, the odds are always
in the house's favor,

16:57.973 --> 16:59.366
so what's the point?

16:59.409 --> 17:01.672
See, that's your problem.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.587
You always have
to have a point.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.763
All of a sudden,
I got a problem?No, I didn't say...

17:05.807 --> 17:07.809
Well, like, look, it was
a metaphor, okay, it's like...

17:07.852 --> 17:09.419
Keep it down!

17:09.463 --> 17:11.552
I'm trying to watch
Judge Judy.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.771
I can't hear a word
with all that banging.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.947
Apologize.
I'm Special Agent McGee.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.428
This is Special Agent Torres.
We're with NCIS.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.300
We're looking for Ana Brooks.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.779
She's gone, kid.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.130
Up and vanished two months ago.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.827
Hasn't been back since.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.611
Won't answer her phone either.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.439
Are you sure?Of course I'm sure.

17:29.483 --> 17:30.919
I'm the building manager.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.313
You think just 'cause I'm old,
I'm senile?

17:33.356 --> 17:34.923
No, ma'am.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.795
You find her, tell her
she owes me two month's rent.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.623
Any friends or family
that we can contact?

17:39.667 --> 17:42.191
Beats me. What do you
want with her anyway?

17:42.235 --> 17:44.759
She's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.630
Well, that's a shame.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.632
Seemed like a nice girl.

17:48.676 --> 17:51.679
Always offered me help
with the groceries.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.073
Should've known.

17:54.116 --> 17:57.511
It's the nice ones
you got to watch out for.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.994
[panting] You know,
I thought I was in good shape.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.301
You're not even
breaking a sweat.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.477
Do we need a break?No, no... maybe.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.653
Maybe just a couple minutes.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.613
I had a really small breakfast,
you know?

18:12.656 --> 18:15.355
So my blood sugar's...
[exhales]

18:21.578 --> 18:22.623
What are you doing?

18:22.666 --> 18:24.407
I went to college in Seattle.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.148
Spent a lot of weekends camping,

18:26.192 --> 18:29.020
learning to survive in the wild,
so, here, eat this.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.761
No, I'm good, I'm good.It's a type of mushroom.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.154
It's called "chicken
of the woods."

18:32.198 --> 18:33.286
It's gonna help you
with your blood sugar.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.462
I'm good, but...

18:35.505 --> 18:37.551
I have this.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.162
You packed food
in with the organ?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.469
Yeah, I didn't know if we'd have
time to stop for lunch.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.515
So... besides,
it's hermetically sealed.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.996
Now, here, try this.

18:48.039 --> 18:51.565
It's a type of sandwich.
It's called PB and J.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.656
[chuckles]

19:04.491 --> 19:06.188
[twig snaps]

19:06.232 --> 19:07.798
[birds fluttering]

19:16.416 --> 19:18.809
Yeah, we got tracks
heading north.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.945
Lower your rifle.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.034
Slowly.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.953
[grunting]

19:34.260 --> 19:36.436
[shouting]

19:38.829 --> 19:40.396
[wincing]

19:40.440 --> 19:42.790
[shouting]

19:51.886 --> 19:54.149
[both shout]

19:58.109 --> 19:59.633
[panting]

20:01.504 --> 20:04.028
Jess?
[grunts]

20:04.072 --> 20:07.031
Jimmy?Yeah, over here, over here.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.424
Jimmy?

20:08.468 --> 20:09.904
I got hit in the leg.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.080
We need to stop the bleeding.Uh...

20:12.123 --> 20:14.648
Yeah.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.694
Okay, okay.

20:17.738 --> 20:20.784
Okay, pull on that, pull, pull.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.265
[grunts]

20:23.309 --> 20:25.354
MAN [on radio]:
Rick, come in.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.835
You there? Rick?

20:27.878 --> 20:30.533
Okay, the others must've
heard the shots. Can you move?

20:30.577 --> 20:32.231
Yeah, yeah.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.276
[grunting]

20:34.320 --> 20:36.017
Okay, lean on me.Yeah.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.540
You good?

20:37.584 --> 20:39.586
Never better.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.458
[chiming]Come on!

20:42.502 --> 20:44.982
Mama wants to buy
a hot dog, hot dog.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.810
Ooh, ooh.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.160
Come on-- oh, gosh, broken.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.466
Broken.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.121
Oh, come on!

20:53.164 --> 20:54.949
All right, you.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.299
Come on, baby, come on,
I know you got me.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.475
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh!

20:59.519 --> 21:01.999
No! Oh, come on!

21:02.043 --> 21:05.046
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes--
oh, no!

21:05.089 --> 21:06.917
This, uh...

21:06.961 --> 21:09.180
feels a little pathological.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.313
Oh.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.359
I was, uh...

21:13.402 --> 21:16.449
checking out
Vega Gaming's other...

21:16.492 --> 21:18.146
gambling machines,
you know?

21:18.189 --> 21:20.453
Just kind of hoping to find
something in the code

21:20.496 --> 21:22.672
that will help us
track down Ana.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.501
Uh-huh.Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

21:25.545 --> 21:28.156
Unfortunately,
I got nothing,

21:28.199 --> 21:29.418
so, oh, no.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.638
Kasie?Hmm?

21:31.681 --> 21:33.683
Do you have a gambling problem
we should know about?

21:33.727 --> 21:36.773
Me? Oh, my gosh.
[laughing]

21:38.079 --> 21:39.559
No.

21:39.602 --> 21:43.171
No. No, no, no, no...

21:43.214 --> 21:45.565
Oh, no.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.480
Yeah, okay,
yeah, maybe a little.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.525
Um, I did manage to find

21:49.569 --> 21:52.354
surveillance footage
from Ana's building

21:52.398 --> 21:54.922
the night she disappeared.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.359
Who's with her?No idea.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.405
The image is too blurry to
make out the license plate.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.798
Friend or foe?Uh, well, they did

22:01.842 --> 22:03.365
open the car door
for her.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.845
Maybe she found
some new partners.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.195
And they all decided
to get rid of the old one.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.631
We have a problem.PARKER: We're even.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.459
I got a headache.
Is that an aspirin?

22:10.503 --> 22:12.287
It's lactulose.
It's used to treat

22:12.331 --> 22:14.942
severe liver disease.And why am I looking at it?

22:14.985 --> 22:17.379
McGee just brought it back
from Ana's apartment.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.642
She's sick?Yes. I tracked down

22:19.686 --> 22:22.341
her doctor.
She's in Mar Vista Hospital.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.256
Been there for weeks
with cirrhosis of the liver.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.564
That doesn't sound good.Well, she needs a
transplant immediately.

22:28.608 --> 22:31.785
Serendipitously,
there is a suitable liver

22:31.828 --> 22:34.614
on its way
to that hospital today.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.051
One, and only one.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.619
Wait, the liver
that Knight and Jimmy

22:39.662 --> 22:42.404
are transporting is for Ana?

22:42.448 --> 22:43.797
Our murder suspect?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.581
We better call Mar Vista
Hospital, warn Knight.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.802
No need. I already called.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.674
Jimmy and Agent Knight
never showed up

22:51.718 --> 22:54.068
with any organ.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.384
[Jimmy grunting]

23:06.472 --> 23:07.647
How much longer?

23:07.690 --> 23:09.910
Another mile or so.
Can you make it?

23:09.953 --> 23:11.433
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.957
You're the one that's doing
all the heavy lifting...

23:14.001 --> 23:15.437
[grunting]

23:15.481 --> 23:17.308
[flies buzzing]

23:17.352 --> 23:19.136
Oh!

23:19.180 --> 23:20.703
That looks like a fresh kill.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.052
Probably a black bear.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.793
Great,
not only do we have to worry

23:23.837 --> 23:25.969
about men with guns-- ow--

23:26.013 --> 23:28.798
chasing us, now we got
to worry about killer bears.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.932
Okay, Jimmy, you can't
keep going on like this.

23:31.975 --> 23:33.629
You're right.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.805
I want this bullet
out of me.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.852
Isn't it better to leave it in?I want it out.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.855
Good luck finding
medical supplies around here.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.206
Maybe we are in luck.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.730
That's a game feeder. People
put it up to attract deer.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.340
Bet you there's a cabin nearby.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.560
I'll believe that when I see it.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.695
Come on.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.784
Let's go.[grunting]

23:57.827 --> 24:00.700
Knight, call me as soon
as you get this.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.572
That was Mar Vista Hospital.
Still no Jimmy or Knight.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.705
Nothing from them for two hours.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.489
You get through
to our murder suspect?

24:07.533 --> 24:09.056
The hospital admin told me
that if we want

24:09.099 --> 24:10.492
to talk to Ana Brooks,
we have to go through

24:10.536 --> 24:12.146
the Department of Justice.What?

24:12.189 --> 24:14.191
What the hell does DoJ
have to do with this?

24:14.235 --> 24:16.455
Maybe we're not the only ones
after Brooks.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.240
Thanks. State troopers
found Knight's car

24:19.283 --> 24:21.198
by Lesesne State Forest.And?

24:21.242 --> 24:23.418
They were shot at. They found
a male body by the car.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.464
No IDs.Let's go.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.770
McGee?I'll hit up DoJ.

24:27.814 --> 24:28.945
Find out what they want
with Ana Brooks.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.686
If they know
who's after our people,

24:30.730 --> 24:32.949
we need everything they got.
Lean on them!

24:32.993 --> 24:34.777
Not a problem.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.692
[grunts]

24:36.736 --> 24:38.607
I want it on record

24:38.651 --> 24:40.261
that I didn't say,
"I told you so."

24:40.304 --> 24:41.828
I admire
your self-restraint.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.656
[grunting]

24:46.572 --> 24:48.704
Abandoned for a while
by the looks of it.

24:48.748 --> 24:51.751
What do we need?Some pliers, something
to clean out this wound.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.971
And, uh, needle and thread
would be nice.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.147
Uh, rags?Yeah.

24:59.933 --> 25:03.110
Got a half bottle of Glencallan.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.112
I'll take it.

25:06.461 --> 25:10.073
Okay, we're in luck--
I have a survival sewing kit.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.685
No pliers.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.905
Oh, got a pocketknife.

25:16.776 --> 25:19.822
You and I have different
definitions of "we're in luck."

25:19.866 --> 25:22.085
Okay.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.435
Good luck, Doctor.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.394
[stammers]
You're gonna do it.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.265
Me? No way.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.180
Well, it's in the back
of my leg. I can't reach.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.399
No way.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.836
Uh, you know what?

25:33.880 --> 25:36.099
The road isn't too far away.
I think we should wait.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.580
Whatever happened to "those
killers are right behind us"?

25:38.624 --> 25:41.104
Well, that was...

25:41.148 --> 25:44.934
that was before you asked me to
take a bullet out of your ass.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.936
Okay, number one,
it is in my thigh.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.808
Secondly, I'm gonna
guide you through it.

25:48.851 --> 25:52.376
I mean, it's gonna be easy,
easy peasy, you'll see.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.687
[groans]

25:59.775 --> 26:01.081
Okay.

26:01.124 --> 26:02.648
Easy peasy.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.564
Hey, hey.

26:06.347 --> 26:07.827
You can do this.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.351
Now get the whiskey.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.658
Yeah.

26:15.138 --> 26:16.879
You're supposed to pour

26:16.923 --> 26:18.620
that on the knife
and then on the wound before...

26:18.664 --> 26:20.143
You know what,
just give me that.

26:20.187 --> 26:22.406
All right.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.628
[grunts]

26:26.672 --> 26:29.500
All right, now...

26:29.544 --> 26:31.502
make an incision
to expand the wound.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.548
[sighs]

26:38.031 --> 26:39.641
[grunting]You okay?

26:39.685 --> 26:41.948
I'm doing really good.
I'm fine... [muttering]

26:42.601 --> 26:44.080
Okay, next you have
to extract that bullet,

26:44.124 --> 26:45.691
but use your fingers,
do not use that knife.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.606
Use my fingers?Just do it

26:47.649 --> 26:49.564
before that whiskey
hits your bloodstream.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.526
[exhales]

26:55.570 --> 26:57.790
[grunting]

26:58.704 --> 27:00.662
Okay, Jimmy, I can't find it.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.229
I'm sorry. I told you
you should do this...

27:02.272 --> 27:03.839
You're doing great.
You're doing a really good job.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.449
Just keep going, keep going!

27:05.493 --> 27:07.800
Okay.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.802
Jess, what happened
after the wedding?

27:09.845 --> 27:11.673
You really want
to talk about that now?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.719
Rather talk about that or how
your hand is right on my butt?

27:13.762 --> 27:15.372
Okay, my hand is on your thigh.

27:15.416 --> 27:16.852
I thought we had a good time.

27:16.896 --> 27:19.638
In fact,
I know we had a great time.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.032
Ever since the wedding

27:23.076 --> 27:24.860
you've been acting
like nothing ever happened.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.561
Jess.

27:30.605 --> 27:32.346
I really like you.

27:32.389 --> 27:34.217
And I think that you...

27:34.261 --> 27:36.567
Oh, got it! I got it.[laughs]

27:36.611 --> 27:38.918
[grunts][stammers]

27:38.961 --> 27:41.007
Okay, rags, rags.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.705
All right, what now?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.054
Now you sew me up.

27:45.098 --> 27:46.577
Oh, Jimmy.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.405
I failed home ec.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.843
Well, there.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.671
Ooh.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.637
You're right.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.858
I like you, too.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.598
You do? Ow!

28:07.642 --> 28:10.340
Okay. Okay, just stay
still, stay still.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.606
I like you.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.087
But?

28:20.568 --> 28:23.310
You're one of my best friends,
Jimmy.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.664
And I can't do anything
that's gonna jeopardize that.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.362
Yeah.

28:32.406 --> 28:34.495
Yeah, that would be
a real bummer.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.454
Let me just say this.

28:37.498 --> 28:40.370
No matter
what happens between us...

28:42.851 --> 28:45.071
...we're still gonna be friends.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.820
I have no idea
who Ana Brooks is.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.083
Yet you have
half the DoJ stationed

28:57.126 --> 28:59.172
on her hospital floor,
Deputy Reeves.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.696
Which is outside
your jurisdiction, Director.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.785
Like hell it is.
Brooks is a suspect

29:03.829 --> 29:05.961
in the murder of a Navy
reservist named John Murphy.

29:06.005 --> 29:08.659
We also have agents
in the field that are missing.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.879
We think whoever's working
with Brooks is after them.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.881
Now are you gonna
give us some answers?

29:12.925 --> 29:15.579
Or are we gonna have
to start busting heads?

29:19.845 --> 29:21.803
Brooks is working with us.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.849
And she can't be
your murder suspect

29:23.892 --> 29:25.676
because she's been
in protective custody

29:25.720 --> 29:27.461
for the last two months.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.810
Protective custody
for what?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.681
She's helping on our case
against Vega Gaming.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.596
The CEO, Paul Newhope,

29:32.640 --> 29:35.425
has been rigging slot machines
and setting them up...

29:35.469 --> 29:37.558
On U.S. Navy bases.Yes.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.299
He's been stealing money
from the government.

29:39.342 --> 29:42.563
And we can finally prove it
with Ms. Brooks' testimony.

29:42.606 --> 29:44.608
So she's not in on the con.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.828
She's a whistleblower.She went to the media first.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.743
Spoke to Murphy
at the Navy Herald.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.832
Then she got scared
and came to us.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.529
We told her to cut
the reporter off.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.357
That's why Murphy had
those slot machines.

29:54.401 --> 29:57.708
He was doing his own
investigation into Vega.And it got him killed.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.972
Newhope must've found out
about our case against him.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.496
He's eliminating anybody
he thinks knows too much.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.193
He's not getting
anywhere near Ms. Brooks.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.239
Well, he doesn't need to.
He just needs to stop her

30:06.282 --> 30:08.850
from getting that transplant.He has no way of knowing
about that.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.548
We've been very careful
with that information.

30:11.592 --> 30:14.160
Not careful enough.
You got a leak.

30:14.203 --> 30:17.859
If Ana Brooks doesn't
get that organ, she dies.

30:17.903 --> 30:21.384
And the DoJ's entire case
dies with her.

30:21.428 --> 30:23.647
We need to find our people now.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.782
I found a map.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.308
Good news.

30:32.352 --> 30:33.744
We're here.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.834
That's the main road,
less than half a mile.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.183
We get there...We flag down

30:37.226 --> 30:39.228
a car and we get this liver
to the hospital.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.447
Can you walk?

30:40.490 --> 30:42.231
Let's get the hell out of here.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.885
Okay.

30:43.929 --> 30:46.409
MAN: Found their trail.
Looks like it leads to a cabin.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.629
I'm gonna check it out.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.153
What now?Okay.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.329
Okay, all right.

30:53.373 --> 30:55.070
New plan.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.898
[grunts]

30:56.942 --> 30:58.682
We're gonna split up.
You're gonna

30:58.726 --> 31:00.771
take this cooler, head east
until you hit the road.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.991
Okay, what are you gonna do?I'm gonna lead them
in the opposite direction.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.254
What? That's suicide.
You can't do that.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.735
Have a little faith, Jimmy.
I can take care of myself.Okay, no, no, no, no.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.650
I will lead them
in the other direction.Okay.

31:09.693 --> 31:10.912
Talk about a suicide mission!Now, you are going...

31:10.956 --> 31:12.827
You're much faster...Jimmy, Jimmy! Jimmy!

31:12.871 --> 31:14.046
We don't have time to argue.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.090
You need to go.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.526
Jess,

31:16.570 --> 31:18.702
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.586
All right, come on.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.805
Sorry, Jimmy.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.024
You need
to get moving.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.418
As far away
from the cabin as possible.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.159
Jess!

31:40.202 --> 31:41.464
[gunshot]Jess!

31:41.508 --> 31:42.857
[gunshots continue]

31:53.215 --> 31:55.565
Has there been any word
from Agent Parker?

31:55.609 --> 31:56.958
Not yet.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.568
All we know is Agent Knight
and Dr. Palmer

31:58.612 --> 31:59.961
are somewhere
in that forest.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.964
I heard that a male victim
had been found.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.923
Unidentified, Dr. Mallard.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.882
We don't know who it is.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.666
No, no. Of co-- of course.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.800
Forgive my concern,
but, uh...

32:12.843 --> 32:15.716
Jimmy is someone...

32:15.759 --> 32:18.153
You're not gonna lose him.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.678
No. Thank you.

32:21.722 --> 32:25.291
Agent McGee is questioning
Vega's CEO, Paul Newhope.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.249
We will find
our people soon.

32:27.293 --> 32:29.121
The interrogation is over.

32:29.164 --> 32:33.168
I do wish I could've been
more helpful, Agent McGee.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.127
I'm sure you do.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.042
Mm.

32:37.085 --> 32:40.001
Good luck finding
your missing friends.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.524
Mm.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.616
Newhope isn't talking?

32:46.660 --> 32:47.835
Claims he doesn't
even know

32:47.878 --> 32:49.532
Ana Brooks.
After all, he has

32:49.576 --> 32:51.317
"hundreds of employees."

32:51.360 --> 32:53.058
All right, we need
hard evidence to link

32:53.101 --> 32:55.060
Newhope directly
to those rigged machines.Yeah, well,

32:55.103 --> 32:57.192
even Murphy's investigation
didn't find anything.

32:57.236 --> 32:58.715
[phone ringing]

32:58.759 --> 33:00.282
It's Parker.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.936
Hey, got you on speaker here.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.808
The body the troopers found was
a man named Scott Long.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.854
He was a doctor
at Shoreside Memorial.

33:06.897 --> 33:10.205
What was he doing in the car
with Jimmy and Knight?

33:10.249 --> 33:12.642
We're trying to find out. He
wasn't supposed to work today.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.514
But he switched shifts
at the last minute.

33:14.557 --> 33:15.689
I don't like the sound of that.

33:15.732 --> 33:16.777
And troopers found

33:16.820 --> 33:18.039
a burner phone near his body.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.606
Do you think he could be
the leak?

33:19.649 --> 33:20.868
It's possible.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.565
I'll text Kasie
the burner number.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.480
Have her check the call log.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.308
Let's see
who Dr. Long was talking to.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.963
Hey, Parker?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.924
We have two sets of tracks.

33:33.968 --> 33:36.144
They both go into the forest.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.928
The small ones here,

33:37.972 --> 33:40.496
they must be Knight and Jimmy.Yeah.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.890
This must be Newhope's men.Yeah, and it looks
like they're sending

33:42.933 --> 33:44.631
a small army after them.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.938
[panting]

33:57.557 --> 33:59.080
[gunshot]

34:01.865 --> 34:04.085
[gunshot in distance][panting]

34:07.958 --> 34:09.699
Long's burner phone--
what do you got?

34:09.743 --> 34:11.832
Uh, one phone call

34:11.875 --> 34:13.834
from Long to Newhope just

34:13.877 --> 34:15.444
after the liver was assigned.

34:15.488 --> 34:16.967
And one text from Long,

34:17.011 --> 34:19.057
when he was on the road
with Knight and Jimmy

34:19.100 --> 34:20.580
giving their location.

34:20.623 --> 34:22.234
Wait, so it wasn't
someone at DoJ.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.496
It was Long.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.106
Long was the leak.
Why?

34:25.150 --> 34:27.761
No idea.
Unless it has something to do

34:27.804 --> 34:29.980
with the 500 grand transferred
to his bank account

34:30.024 --> 34:32.113
just before he sent that text.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.637
Who did Long text,
Newhope?Uh...

34:34.681 --> 34:37.162
No. It was a different number.
Unlisted.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.381
Can you track it?
It could be the shooters

34:39.425 --> 34:40.817
after Jimmy and Knight.

34:41.644 --> 34:44.691
Northeast part
of Lesesne State Forest.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.606
It's got to be Newhope's men.

34:46.649 --> 34:48.912
All right, send that
GPS location to Parker now.

34:57.007 --> 35:00.141
[gunshots][grunting]

35:09.019 --> 35:11.109
Drop it!

35:11.152 --> 35:13.154
Drop it!

35:14.938 --> 35:17.245
I got her!

35:17.289 --> 35:19.160
Bring her down here!

35:21.336 --> 35:23.033
Get down!

35:23.077 --> 35:25.384
Well, I don't know what
kind of game you're playing,

35:25.427 --> 35:27.777
but it's over.
Where's the cooler?

35:27.821 --> 35:29.823
I dumped it.
I've kind of been running

35:29.866 --> 35:31.694
for my life here,
and it was slowing me down.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.218
But I can take you to it.

35:33.261 --> 35:34.784
You're lying.

35:34.828 --> 35:37.265
There was another guy with you.
He must have it.

35:37.309 --> 35:40.486
Okay, you got me, you got me.
But, look, he's long gone.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.879
Sorry.

35:44.707 --> 35:47.493
Stop! Stop!
[grunting]

35:51.671 --> 35:52.846
Jimmy?

35:52.889 --> 35:54.717
You can have the cooler.
Just let her go.

35:54.761 --> 35:57.329
Just...
[grunting]

35:57.372 --> 35:59.200
What are you doing here?

35:59.244 --> 36:00.723
I'm not gonna
leave you here to die.

36:00.767 --> 36:02.203
You're ruining
the plan.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.683
It looked like you needed
a little bit of help.

36:03.726 --> 36:04.771
Okay, I have this
under control.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.207
This is under control?Yes.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.166
Shut the hell up!

36:19.089 --> 36:21.570
We got the liver.
Let's get the hell out of here.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.665
Now![grunting]

36:33.103 --> 36:35.062
[groans loudly]

36:37.456 --> 36:39.632
[gunshots][grunting]

36:43.636 --> 36:45.942
Jimmy.

36:45.986 --> 36:48.206
What the hell were you thinking?

36:48.249 --> 36:49.424
I told you.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.773
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.993
[laughs softly]

36:54.821 --> 36:56.518
PARKER: Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:56.562 --> 36:58.259
Easy, easy.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.391
Are you two
all right?

36:59.434 --> 37:01.044
Nick, I've been better.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.351
Looks like
we're too late.

37:03.395 --> 37:04.961
No.

37:05.005 --> 37:06.963
That liver came from the carcass
of a dead deer.

37:07.007 --> 37:10.358
Thank God none of these guys
had a medical degree.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.055
Where's the real liver at?

37:12.099 --> 37:13.970
It's back at the cabin on ice.
If we hurry,

37:14.014 --> 37:16.843
we can get it to the hospital
in time for the transplant.

37:22.152 --> 37:25.112
Damn. Could've been me
out there with Jimmy.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.245
Sorry you missed out
on all the action?

37:27.288 --> 37:28.594
Yep.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.552
Like digging a bullet
out of Jimmy's backside?

37:30.596 --> 37:32.511
Never mind. I'm glad it was you.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.426
PARKER:
Talked to DoJ.

37:34.469 --> 37:36.123
Ana's transplant was successful.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.430
Well, that's
gonna make Jimmy happy.

37:38.473 --> 37:40.301
And she can testify
against Newhope.

37:40.345 --> 37:43.783
One of the guys you took down
admitted to killing Murphy.

37:43.826 --> 37:44.958
PARKER:
All under Newhope's orders.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.307
He's going away
for a long time.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.569
Case closed.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.615
Shall we call it a night?Let's do it.

37:55.142 --> 37:56.361
Knight?

37:56.404 --> 37:58.145
You guys go ahead.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.887
Um, I got some stuff
I need to take care of.

38:08.373 --> 38:11.201
Have a good long rest.

38:12.464 --> 38:15.684
You deserve it, Mr. Murphy.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.297
Ah, Agent Knight.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.037
Good to see you
here, Ducky.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.474
Ah, you as well.

38:22.517 --> 38:25.651
Oh, I must congratulate you
on your surgical skills.

38:25.694 --> 38:29.045
Dr. Palmer's wound
will heal nicely.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.004
Glad to know
I didn't scar him for life.

38:31.047 --> 38:33.223
[chuckles]Has Jimmy left already?

38:33.267 --> 38:36.009
JIMMY:
Dr. Mallard, did you rearrange
all my supplies?

38:36.052 --> 38:38.011
If by "rearrange,"

38:38.054 --> 38:41.493
you mean put them
on the right shelf, then yes.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.451
Okay, now that is a matter

38:43.495 --> 38:45.148
of opin...

38:46.411 --> 38:48.195
Jess. Hey.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.588
Hey.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.852
The transplant
operation went well.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.288
Thought you'd
like to know.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.594
Thanks.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.684
I must say...

38:58.727 --> 39:00.860
today has been
a nice change

39:00.903 --> 39:03.297
from my duties as historian,

39:03.341 --> 39:05.517
but now...
[chuckles]

39:05.560 --> 39:07.475
...it is time for me to return

39:07.519 --> 39:09.434
to my sanctuary.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.566
So I bid you...

39:11.610 --> 39:14.047
good night.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.179
Good night.Good night, Doctor.

39:19.661 --> 39:22.229
I just wanted to say thank you.

39:22.272 --> 39:23.709
For coming back for me.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.754
Oh, yeah, any-anytime.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.582
Anytime.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.716
Hey, Jess, uh, um...

39:30.759 --> 39:33.066
for what it's worth...

39:34.154 --> 39:38.071
...whatever's going on
in that mystical brain of yours,

39:38.114 --> 39:40.421
I just want to say...

39:42.597 --> 39:44.556
...you'll never catch a wave

39:44.599 --> 39:46.906
if you're afraid
to get on the surfboard.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.086
Or... boogie board.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.131
[both laugh]

39:56.350 --> 39:58.265
And despite everything,

39:58.308 --> 40:01.050
I'm glad we got to spend
some time together today.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.269
Mm-hmm.

40:02.312 --> 40:04.097
Feel like I got
to know you better.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.533
Me, too.

40:05.577 --> 40:08.406
Mr. Hermetically Sealed PBJ.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.625
[both chuckle]

40:13.933 --> 40:15.413
Uh, I should get home

40:15.456 --> 40:17.676
to Victoria, yeah.I got a dinner with, uh, Kasie.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.199
[both clear throats]

40:23.029 --> 40:26.511
So there's this new coffee shop
a couple of blocks from here.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.991
Oh, yeah?I don't know if you know,
but I'm kind of a connoisseur.

40:29.035 --> 40:31.864
And I've been dying
to try their Elvis Presso.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.565
Want to check it out?

40:42.788 --> 40:44.790
Let me check my calendar.
