of how far we've come

16:57.283 --> 17:01.119
Because of the accomplishments
of "dr. King."

17:01.121 --> 17:04.555
Did you just air quote
dr. King?

17:04.557 --> 17:09.127
No. I am a medical doctor
<i>because</i> of "dr." king.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.362
Are you hating
on dr. King?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.064
No, he is
a great man, dre.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.033
He has a nobel peace prize,
okay?
Mm-hmm.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.267
I do not have one.
Mnh-mnh.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.769
But if you were to have
a heart attack,

17:17.771 --> 17:20.638
He would give a great speech,
and I would keep you alive.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.640
I just don't understand
why we're called the same thing.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.775
It's just...

17:23.777 --> 17:25.276
Wow.
It's just...

17:25.278 --> 17:27.045
I really don't like
this side of you.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.079
What?
So I'm...

17:28.081 --> 17:30.048
[ tapping ]
...Tapping out.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.550
Well, go ahead and tap out,
but if you slip and fall,

17:32.552 --> 17:34.585
I'll just have to find you
a phd to help you.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.521
Oh.
You know, with a book.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.290
Charlie?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.491
We found him
by chair nine.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.160
He was holding two buttons
and a carrot.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.695
Snow ain't no joke.
Oh, my god.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.698
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>I was ready to get my vacation</i>

17:47.700 --> 17:50.535
<i>Back on track</i>
<i>and do some skiing.</i>

17:50.537 --> 17:53.538
Charlie.
Are you wearing dress slacks?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.073
Don't worry about it!

17:55.075 --> 17:56.174
I'm gonna tuck 'em
into my socks.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.677
Oh, man.
I forgot socks.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.646
Sometimes when
I'm talking to the lord,

18:01.648 --> 18:04.849
Where's everybody else at?
[ chuckles ]

18:04.851 --> 18:06.684
You know, junior and zach
are on their way down now.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.820
Everybody else
must be on the slopes.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.822
Knowing them, they couldn't wait
to get out there.

18:10.824 --> 18:15.860
[ vibrating ]
oh, this...Feels...So...Good.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.729
Would you like plain
or vanilla greek yogurt

18:18.731 --> 18:20.298
On your feet, ma'am?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.732
Oh, one of each, please.
Mm-hmm.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.435
Left, plain, right, vanilla.
[ chuckles ]
mm-hmm.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.105
We'll find them
on the mountain.
Cool, cool.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.406
All right.
Oh, hey, junior,

18:28.408 --> 18:30.641
I want to apologize
for being an idiot last night.

18:30.643 --> 18:34.745
So I will not force my agenda
on you anymore.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.248
I'll believe it when I see it,
but cool.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.750
Yeah, all right.
Let's get on this bus.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.886
The racks are
for skiers only.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.888
Snowboarders and their boards
take the rear seats.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.623
But they're heavy.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.758
Wow, we don't get racks,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.794
And we have to sit
in the back of the bus?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.762
What are we,
second-class citizens?

18:51.764 --> 18:55.199
These nice resorts --
it's a skier's world.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.135
Ma'am, snowboarders sit
in the back.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.603
[ scoffs ]
can't you give me a break?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.805
The bus is half empty.
It's the rules.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.609
That's not cool.
She's old and tired.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.879
I'm only 40, and I slept
10 hours last night.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.881
Uh...

19:09.883 --> 19:11.315
This is crazy.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.452
Excuse me.
Can I say something?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.787
[<i> bell dings</i> ]
<i>and then it happened.</i>

19:16.789 --> 19:18.890
<i>When confronted</i>
<i>with actual injustice,</i>

19:18.892 --> 19:21.259
<i>Even if it was small-scale,</i>

19:21.261 --> 19:24.362
<i>In the spirit of dr. King,</i>
<i>junior knew how to step up.</i>

19:24.364 --> 19:26.831
I may be a newbie
to snowboarding,

19:26.833 --> 19:30.668
But the way you're treating her,
it's not right.

19:30.670 --> 19:35.173
There's no difference
between boarders and skiers.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.775
We're all just people
with wood strapped to our feet,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.777
Sliding down a mountain.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.713
I have a dream that one day

19:42.715 --> 19:45.883
We will not be judged
by the size of our board,

19:45.885 --> 19:48.519
But by what we do
in the pow-pow.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.521
Because the snow doesn't care
who we are.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.356
It does not.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.691
Snow plays for keeps.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.859
Uh...Okay.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.961
It just wants
to be thrashed.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.829
Free to thrash.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.498
Free to thrash!

20:00.500 --> 20:03.901
Thank god almighty,
we're free to thrash!

20:03.903 --> 20:05.269
[ laughs ]
[ applause ]

20:05.271 --> 20:06.938
Hey, that's my son,
everybody!

20:06.940 --> 20:09.941
My son --
a stand-up dude.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.777
Hey, that was
kind of impressive, son.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.779
I'm really proud
of you.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.782
It just didn't feel right
<i>not</i> to say something.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.617
I know that you think
I've had it so easy

20:19.619 --> 20:22.520
That I don't see what's up,
but I do.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.823
I'm a black kid in a world
where bad things happen to us.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.491
They can happen
to<i> anyone.</i>

20:27.493 --> 20:30.328
And that's why
I worry about you, son.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.729
And I worry
about you, too.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.564
But you've got to believe
that you've taught me enough

20:33.566 --> 20:36.534
To be careful,
but also brave.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.869
[ chuckles ]
you're right.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.540
It's really the same choice
frodo faced

20:42.542 --> 20:44.775
At the black gates
of mordor.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.779
All right,
back of the bus, nerd.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.314
[ both sigh ]

20:50.316 --> 20:53.651
Cannot have
a moment with you.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.785
I cannot.

20:57.523 --> 21:04.462
<i>A little bit of learning</i>
<i>and a lot of relaxing.</i>

21:04.464 --> 21:06.297
<i>In the end, it doesn't matter</i>

21:06.299 --> 21:08.299
<i>How you spend</i>
<i>dr. King's weekend,</i>

21:08.301 --> 21:09.934
<i>Just as long as you remember</i>

21:09.936 --> 21:13.537
<i>How he helped us all</i>
<i>make it to the mountaintop.</i>

21:13.539 --> 21:17.541
This is exactly what
I imagine heaven to be like.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.413
[ sighs ]
this is my hell.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.447
[ giggles ]
