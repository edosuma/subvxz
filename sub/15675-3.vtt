00:01.669 --> 00:04.572
( static hissing )

00:04.605 --> 00:08.042
CQ, CQ, is this
frequency in use?

00:08.076 --> 00:10.144
( static hissing )

00:11.379 --> 00:13.481
CQ, is anybody out there?

00:15.516 --> 00:18.386
Hello?
This is KC4L.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.488
Can anybody hear me?

00:20.521 --> 00:22.756
( static hissing )

00:24.258 --> 00:26.160
What's that?

00:26.194 --> 00:28.429
Uh, it's a radio
that I made.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.265
What does CQ mean?

00:31.299 --> 00:35.503
It's what you say
when you're looking for other
people who've made radios.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.805
Comes from the French
word sécurité,

00:37.838 --> 00:40.541
which means safety
or security.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.611
You can hear it when
you say "secu, secu."

00:45.879 --> 00:47.415
Did you want something?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.483
I wanted to say good night.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.453
Oh, God, Lump,
I'm so sorry.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.488
Did you brush your teeth?

00:56.190 --> 00:58.592
Okay, I'll be out there
in just a second, okay?

01:02.563 --> 01:05.633
Daddy's in the closet
looking for people
with radios.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.136
Okay.

01:11.672 --> 01:12.740
( blows )

01:14.408 --> 01:16.877
( scoffs )
That thing made it
from Texas

01:16.910 --> 01:19.313
and the KitchenAid
is still in storage?

01:19.347 --> 01:21.849
Are you really
gonna stand there and try
and pass yourself off

01:21.882 --> 01:23.817
as someone who ever
used that mixer?

01:23.851 --> 01:26.287
Are you sure
this is the best place
for all this?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.289
No, I'm pretty sure
it's the worst place
for it,

01:28.322 --> 01:30.691
but since the place
that I was gonna use
isn't available,

01:30.724 --> 01:34.662
- I'm making do.
- Okay, sorry.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197
Have you found anyone?

01:36.230 --> 01:39.533
No, the connection sucks.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.801
Is it the antenna, maybe?

01:40.834 --> 01:43.137
I don't know.
Could be.

01:43.171 --> 01:46.207
Or it could be
that all the guys that were
out there when I was a kid

01:46.240 --> 01:48.542
are too busy
running companies
to have time for hams.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.444
Yeah, or they moved online.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.648
There must be some
new kids out there.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.786
I'll be out in a sec.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.725
( music blaring on headset )

02:06.427 --> 02:09.530
CQ, CQ, for shit's sake,
is anybody out there?

02:11.365 --> 02:14.735
Hey, Cameron and I decided to
have a weekly project meeting

02:14.768 --> 02:17.238
to streamline
the SwapMeet integration

02:17.271 --> 02:20.741
and we thought that you'd
be a valuable addition.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.377
Yeah, sure.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.745
If you want me there.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.480
Yeah, we do.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.754
Do you want me there
because you think I might
have something to contribute

02:33.787 --> 02:36.890
or because you want me
to feel like I have
something to do?

02:36.924 --> 02:40.328
How about just because
I respect your opinion?

02:40.361 --> 02:42.530
'Cause I just don't
want you to feel like
I can't self-start

02:42.563 --> 02:44.232
because I absolutely can.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.534
No, of course you can,
but the coders look to you.

02:46.567 --> 02:50.438
I feel like you could be
a valuable liaison.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.440
And I want you there.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.445
Okay. Yeah.
I'll be there.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.347
Good.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.453
You know I don't
really have a choice.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.854
You're my ride.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.298
"Absolute Beginners" playing

03:20.268 --> 03:22.470
* There's nothing
much to take *

03:28.309 --> 03:30.778
* I'm an absolute beginner

03:37.017 --> 03:39.587
* And I'm absolutely sane

03:45.459 --> 03:47.895
* As long
as we're together *

03:53.867 --> 03:56.537
* The rest
can go to hell *

04:02.376 --> 04:05.379
* I absolutely love you

04:10.484 --> 04:12.986
* But we're
absolute beginners *

04:19.327 --> 04:22.296
* With eyes
completely open *

04:27.635 --> 04:31.071
* But nervous
all the same *

04:31.104 --> 04:33.040
* If our love song...

04:33.073 --> 04:36.577
- Mr. MacMillan. Hi.
- Ryan, welcome.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.947
I didn't realize it was,
you know, gonna be such
a big party, so I...

04:39.980 --> 04:43.551
That was very thoughtful.
Thank you.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.719
This is really
a beautiful place you have.

04:45.753 --> 04:49.490
- You know, it's dark.
- Mmm.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.892
Can't really see
what everything
looks like,

04:51.925 --> 04:55.028
but from what
I can tell, it's--

04:55.062 --> 04:57.665
it's so...

05:00.968 --> 05:02.770
Asian.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.037
I'm glad you like it.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.839
Yeah, it took me
a while to find it.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.508
I don't really know
the city that well.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.443
I grew up
in Burlingame.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.412
It's not far.

05:11.445 --> 05:16.316
Just-- yeah, we didn't
really get to come to
the city that much.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.856
I really
do like it, though.
I mean, look at it.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.858
It's just so...

05:24.892 --> 05:26.527
Asian.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.932
You sure do have
a lot of friends, huh?

05:31.965 --> 05:35.068
I wouldn't really call
these people my friends.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.671
Most of them
don't even know
whose house they're at.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.674
Except for Ken over there.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.643
Ken knows exactly
where he is.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.046
You know what?
I'm thirsty.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.881
Why don't we
open this up?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.822
* As long as you're
still smiling... *

05:54.855 --> 05:56.056
So whereabouts
do you live now?

05:56.089 --> 05:57.958
Or are you still
in Burlingame?

05:57.991 --> 06:00.594
Oh, no, I got out
of there a while ago.

06:00.628 --> 06:03.564
I'm in Los Altos
now with a bunch
of college buddies.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.467
They're really jealous
that I'm working for you.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.770
I was telling them
about how the office
is on the top--

06:09.803 --> 06:11.705
What do you do for fun?

06:11.739 --> 06:15.042
Oh, um, you know,
the usual.

06:15.075 --> 06:18.446
Video games.
Movies.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.482
But mostly
I just love to code.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.618
I can't tell you
how curious I am

06:24.652 --> 06:26.620
to see what you have
in mind for me.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.122
You came to me, Ryan.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.592
Yeah, I know.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.428
I have a ton of ideas.
I'd love to show them to you.

06:36.564 --> 06:40.133
But I know the company
is focused on user version
2.0 right now.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.135
So I'm just ready
to pitch in.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.171
Is that what you think
I'm looking for?

06:48.008 --> 06:51.712
All right, someone just
came in who I really
need to speak to.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.616
Hey, it's a party.
Try and have fun.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.819
* If there's reason

06:58.852 --> 07:02.890
* To feel
all the hard times *

07:02.923 --> 07:07.194
* To lay down
the hard lines *

07:07.227 --> 07:12.700
* It's absolutely true.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.052
( static hissing )

07:39.192 --> 07:42.930
( man's voice,
indistinct )

08:29.242 --> 08:29.710
What are you doing up?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.617
( sighs )

08:37.885 --> 08:40.320
Joe MacMillan?

08:40.353 --> 08:41.855
Really?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.696
Do you have any idea
what you're getting
yourself into?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.831
Well, I was hoping
to learn something--

08:50.864 --> 08:54.902
Look, I know you must
be feeling real special
right about now.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.105
Joe's great at that,
but trust me,

08:58.138 --> 09:00.708
he will burn you.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.043
Look, I know I should
have probably talked
to you about it--

09:03.076 --> 09:05.613
He did it to me.
He did it to Gordon.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.881
Even Donna, the nicest
woman on the planet,

09:07.915 --> 09:09.149
doesn't speak
to him anymore.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.951
You think you're gonna
be any different?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.053
I don't know, Cameron.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.589
Listen, I get it.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.091
Really, I do.

09:18.125 --> 09:22.863
And I'm willing to give you
a pass just this once.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.132
Come back to Mutiny.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.100
Be a part of something real.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.037
I don't even think
the guys would have me back.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.105
Well, the guys will deal
if I tell them to.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.177
What do you say?

09:44.718 --> 09:45.986
Okay.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.863
You just made
a really dumb call.

09:58.866 --> 10:01.669
I told her you weren't home.
She wouldn't leave.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.805
She was here
for like an hour

10:04.838 --> 10:06.674
just staring.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.942
Dude, where've you been?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.779
I got hammered
and passed out at Joe's.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.915
Oh, wow.
Hey, was that fun?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.685
I don't know
what the hell it was.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.921
Okay, that makes
absolutely zero sense.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.756
Well, we thought it made
a lot of sense.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.892
Well, you guys are
the heads of the company.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.360
Of course you should
be the ones to bring
the offer over to SwapMeet.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.797
Gordon, it's a formality.
Bos can do it.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.299
It's not a formality.
It's about perception.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.168
And the people that
you're buying, especially since
they're coming to work here,

10:35.202 --> 10:37.370
need to view you and Donna
as the ones in charge.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.373
Gordon, we've already met
with them a gazillion
times, okay?

10:40.407 --> 10:43.176
We've had lunch.
We've had drinks.
They know we're in charge.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.946
God, if I had it
my way, they'd just
send us the disks

10:45.979 --> 10:47.715
and we could
call it a day.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.717
Okay, look,
it's dropping off
an envelope.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.384
You don't mind
doing it, do you?

10:51.418 --> 10:54.988
Do you want to make it
sound any less important?

10:55.022 --> 10:57.758
- I would be happy to do it.
- Thank you.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.860
Okay, so the whole company
is gonna bend over backwards

10:59.893 --> 11:01.729
because she can't
get over herself.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.198
No, I don't think
it's a good idea for us
to go either.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.368
The heads of the company
don't tender the initial offer.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.238
We wait for the counter
and only get involved

11:11.271 --> 11:12.806
when the real
negotiations begin.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.142
That's how you show them
who's in charge.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.010
Mm, okay.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.312
Okay, up next,

11:19.346 --> 11:22.149
how are we doing
on the speed of
the background graphics?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.752
Well, we'll never get under
half a second at 2,400 baud.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.019
We're gonna need
to use Huffman,

11:26.053 --> 11:27.454
or even better,
Lempel-Ziv compressions

11:27.487 --> 11:29.122
so we're not sending
all the bits through.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.424
Okay, since when are we
doing a graduate seminar

11:31.458 --> 11:34.094
on information theory?
Our guys can't handle that.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.764
No, no, no.
That's smart not sending
all the bits through.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.033
We preload the most common
backgrounds on the diskettes
users already have

11:40.067 --> 11:41.769
and just send
the catalog numbers.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.738
Okay, so just send
the index to the scene.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.274
Okay, that's good.
I see that.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.376
That's good, right?
No complex coding.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.444
Well, you'll have a limited
set of images

11:51.478 --> 11:54.281
and the user
will get tired of waiting
for the same-old same-old,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.984
but, yeah, it's great
if that's what you guys
want to do. Great.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.218
- Great.
- Great.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.188
So we will
preload the data.
Thank you.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.924
And now for what I thought
was going to be

12:03.957 --> 12:05.926
the only unpleasant topic
for this meeting--

12:05.959 --> 12:08.261
evidently I was wrong--

12:08.295 --> 12:09.930
replacing Ryan.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.464
Oh, I went by
his house this morning.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.267
He is not open
to coming back.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.538
What?

12:18.571 --> 12:21.408
You didn't harm him
in any way, did you?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.543
No, he was fine
when I left.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.013
I mean, he's a moron,
but he was ambulatory.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.548
You know, I want
you looking for people
at that class tonight.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.483
Oh, God.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.552
Hey, look,
I'm already covering
for you at this lunch.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.988
And don't complain about
being asked for by name

12:35.022 --> 12:36.189
by the next generation
of coding talent.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.158
You should be
very flattered.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.061
Even if I find someone,
it's gonna take forever
to catch them up.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.196
Ryan really understood the guts
of the neighborhood code.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.132
And if we're gonna build out
SwapMeet alongside it,

12:45.165 --> 12:47.067
we need someone
who really gets it.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.839
Well, uh, who wrote
the original code
for that section?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.511
- Tom did.
- Great, which one is Tom?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.814
None of them.
He didn't make the trip.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.183
- Why not?
- He just didn't.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.986
- Okay, was it
a money thing or...
- No.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.888
- Well, then get him back.
- No.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.957
If you can't get Ryan,
getting the programmer

13:09.990 --> 13:11.591
who originated the code
makes the most sense.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.427
Look, Gordon, I said no.
Can we just drop it, please?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.029
Why am I even
in this meeting

13:16.063 --> 13:18.131
if no one's gonna listen
to a word I have to say?

13:18.165 --> 13:21.068
We are listening.
We're simply disagreeing.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.870
No, Donna,
you're disagreeing.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.471
Because you are opining
on subjects

13:24.504 --> 13:26.373
about which you do not have
all the information.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.509
I am opining on subjects
on which I am fully informed.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.378
No, Gordon,
you really aren't.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.547
A lot happened while you
were off doing other things.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.150
Oh, damn it, Donna.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.854
You know what?
I screwed her once, okay?
Jesus.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.927
Excuse me.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.364
What the hell was that?

13:51.398 --> 13:52.933
Please, like Cameron
doesn't already know.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.301
The walls in our place
are so goddamn thin,

13:54.334 --> 13:56.236
she can hear it
every time I take a shit.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.172
I invite you
to a meeting and this
is the way you behave?

13:59.206 --> 14:02.009
- What is wrong with you?
- I am sick and tired
of being punished.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.044
Okay? I agreed to the move.
I bought the mainframe.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.513
I fixed the mainframe.
I've let her live with us.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.882
Everything I've been asked
to do, I've done.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.451
I shut you down because Tom
is Cameron's ex-boyfriend.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.153
So what?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.988
So it's obviously
a sensitive subject

14:15.022 --> 14:16.623
and I was trying
to steer you away from it.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.959
So you thought my infidelity
would be a wonderful topic?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.227
You brought that up.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.129
While I was off
doing other things.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.197
Like everybody in this room
doesn't know what that means.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.266
- I was talking
about the mainframe.
- No, you weren't.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.601
No, you weren't
and don't pretend
that you were.

14:28.635 --> 14:33.206
It's always there, Donna.
Every time I look at you,
it's always there.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.574
This is not something
to discuss here.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.209
We'll talk about it
at home.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.213
What's the difference?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.224
Man on radio:
Hello?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.293
Greetings from the ether.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.597
Is anybody there?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.302
I'm right here.
Can you hear me?

15:37.037 --> 15:40.340
I'm right here.
This is KC4L, over.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.042
Hello?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.977
I'm right here.
Can you hear me?

15:45.712 --> 15:47.414
Right this way.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.316
First time
dining with us?

15:49.349 --> 15:51.951
No.
I wish.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.288
- Oh, hello there.
- No, don't get up.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.524
- ( both chuckle )
- Oh.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.292
Sorry.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.061
Where's Cameron?

16:01.094 --> 16:04.564
Oh, she is preparing
a guest lecture she
is giving tonight.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.566
She's so sorry
that she couldn't
make it.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.168
We'll have to
soldier on without her.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.270
May I get you something
from the bar?

16:10.303 --> 16:13.240
You know what?
I will have a gin
and tonic, please.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.175
- Very well.
- Thank you.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.609
Nice choice.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.515
( laughs )
And what's your excuse?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.184
I just like
drinking at lunch.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.718
( laughs )

16:25.752 --> 16:29.056
So, the official SwapMeet
offer is happening today?

16:29.089 --> 16:31.724
Yes, John Bosworth
is taking it over later
this afternoon.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.560
- Exciting.
- Yeah.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.328
Will he go over
with you and Cameron?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.664
No, he's our advance man.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.667
He's taking care of it.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.240
- Whenever the ladies are ready.
- The usual, Jason.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.109
Chicken paillard.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.311
It's thin, crispy,
and somehow still juicy.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.612
I don't know
how they do it.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.182
Uh, you know,
I will try the...

16:55.215 --> 16:57.684
mushroom ris--
risotto.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.490
You still wear
your ring, huh?

17:03.523 --> 17:06.293
- For work.
- Mmm.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.662
Men can't seem
to handle the idea
that sexual availability

17:09.696 --> 17:12.165
and business acumen
can exist in the same body.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.367
It simplifies things.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.837
So when you say John Bosworth
is your advance man,

17:17.870 --> 17:19.272
what exactly do you mean?

17:19.306 --> 17:20.473
"War Songs" playing

17:20.507 --> 17:22.242
* I like new fashion

17:22.275 --> 17:23.643
* I like old stories

17:23.676 --> 17:26.045
* Like my sister
used to tell *

17:27.780 --> 17:29.716
* This is the voice

17:29.749 --> 17:31.684
* This is the picture

17:31.718 --> 17:35.522
* I like romantics,
but I don't like Steven *

17:35.555 --> 17:37.357
* Old men...

17:37.390 --> 17:39.292
Whatcha doing?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.361
Oh, I'm just working
on 2.0 with Brent.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.263
I figured it was
all hands on deck,

17:43.296 --> 17:44.797
so I would jump in
and help out.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.134
Don't do that.
I've already got a Brent.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.568
That's not what
I hired you for.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.774
Hey!
Excuse me.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.344
Excuse me.
Wait.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.481
Hey, man, why did you
hire me, then?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.816
I'm beginning
to wonder that myself.

18:03.850 --> 18:08.288
* Old men love
war songs *

18:08.321 --> 18:10.290
* Love Vera Lynn...

18:10.323 --> 18:12.692
You know, I just--

18:12.725 --> 18:15.395
I didn't know what
I was getting myself into.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.665
You know, and I wanted
to fix things so bad,

18:18.698 --> 18:21.434
but, I don't know,

18:21.468 --> 18:24.537
she just doesn't seem
to want me there.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.339
I mean,
she says she does,

18:26.373 --> 18:29.842
but that's what she thinks
I want to hear.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.544
( door opens )

18:31.578 --> 18:33.646
Oh, wait.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.416
- ( door closes )
- Donna?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.852
That's my wife.
This is KC4L signing off.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.754
Hey, Donna.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.725
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.261
I, uh, finally got
the ham working.

18:48.295 --> 18:52.799
You know
I was always planning
on moving out, right?

18:52.832 --> 18:56.703
Like, this is not exactly
an ideal setup for me either.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.872
It's not like
I like listening
to you take a dump.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.545
You know, just for
the record, Donna never
said anything to me

19:05.578 --> 19:08.281
about whatever problems
you guys were having.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.750
She would never do that.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.223
( door closes )

19:16.256 --> 19:18.157
( scraping )

19:20.927 --> 19:23.396
( German accent )
I have the letters
of transit.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.599
A very important
document.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.768
- It's the SwapMeet offer.
- Oh.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.770
And Godspeed to you, sir.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.873
How was lunch?

19:33.906 --> 19:35.675
Extremely delightful.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.510
I had risotto,

19:37.544 --> 19:39.946
which is rice,
but not.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.648
( laughs )

19:41.681 --> 19:43.916
What else did you have?

19:43.950 --> 19:46.853
I had a few--
several gin and tonics.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.325
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm great.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.663
Fine.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.768
You know, my ex worked
those long-haul flights

20:01.801 --> 20:04.271
and I was away on business
half the month.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.939
We barely spent
any time together.

20:06.973 --> 20:11.411
Still managed to get
on each other's last nerve.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.746
I don't know how
you and Gordon do it.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.218
Well, apparently,
not so well.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.827
I think your husband's
all kind of tricky,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.930
but, by God,
I know he cares.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.366
I can feel it
from 50 paces.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.671
There are men
out there who've done
a lot worse, Donna.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.307
Yeah.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.912
But it's hard
to turn that
into good news.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.934
I want you to come
to this meeting.

21:25.485 --> 21:25.885
( door opens )

21:29.722 --> 21:31.391
You must be
John Bosworth.

21:33.092 --> 21:36.028
Diane Gould.
I'll be your backup
this afternoon.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.764
Oh, pleasure
to meet you.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.931
Didn't know
I needed backup.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.501
Well, you don't,
of course.

21:41.534 --> 21:45.405
I just knew you'd be here
and I thought it would be
a nice way for us to meet.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.973
Sure.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.812
Seems a little quiet.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.514
Yeah, I noticed that.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.583
And the parking lot
seemed empty.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.050
Yeah, I noticed
that, too.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.887
Maybe we should
get a tour.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.090
We're giving them 600,000
of my hard-earned dollars

22:04.123 --> 22:05.792
and a piece
of your company.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.594
That earns us
a poke around.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.397
Doug Sheridan.
So nice to meet you.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.998
- Hey.
- This is my partner
Craig Bausch.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.700
Craig, John Bosworth.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.035
Nice to finally put
some faces to the names.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.070
This here is Diane Gould,
our partner.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.806
Of course.
Pleasure to finally
meet you.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.144
This is quite
the delivery committee.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.448
While we're here,
we thought we should
have a look around.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.485
Oh, of course.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.953
Sure.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.022
Welcome.
( chuckles )

22:40.192 --> 22:42.662
We pulled a pretty epic
all-nighter last night,

22:42.695 --> 22:44.664
so we're kind of down
to bare bones.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.703
But you should be able
to get a sense of the place.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.180
( sips )

23:01.213 --> 23:03.450
I know I speak
for all the investors

23:03.483 --> 23:05.952
when I say
how delighted we are

23:05.985 --> 23:09.388
with the growth
of the individual user base.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.459
That tastes terrible.

23:12.492 --> 23:16.529
- I mean, that tastes
just like... ugh.
- ( men laughing )

23:16.563 --> 23:19.131
Look, we may not have
seen it at the start,

23:19.165 --> 23:21.901
but the people
have spoken

23:21.934 --> 23:25.137
and you truly are

23:25.171 --> 23:28.541
the thought leader
that we always
knew you were.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.042
Huh?

23:34.781 --> 23:38.951
So 2.0.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.490
When are we doing this?

23:43.523 --> 23:47.126
Well, production can
have disks ready to ship
in a matter of months.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.161
Man: The question is,
is it better to start charging
at the beginning of the year?

23:49.195 --> 23:51.798
Man #2:
Or do we flip the switch
in September

23:51.831 --> 23:54.867
and hope that the charges
get lost in the list of
back-to-school expenses?

23:54.901 --> 23:57.003
What do you think?

23:57.036 --> 24:00.907
When do you think
we should start charging
for the new user version?

24:02.642 --> 24:03.543
Well, I--

24:05.211 --> 24:08.915
I mean, I thought
you weren't going to charge.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.118
( laughs )
Hold on, I'm--

24:12.151 --> 24:14.854
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

24:14.887 --> 24:17.490
- Ryan.
- Ryan, right.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.091
Of course
we're gonna charge.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.528
I mean, what's the point
of developing a user base

24:21.561 --> 24:23.763
if we don't turn them
into paying customers
at some point?

24:23.796 --> 24:27.867
And my gut is telling me
sooner rather than later.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.502
What a surprise.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.572
I see a spigot
and I want to turn it on.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.541
Man #2:
The focus groups
we've done indicate

24:34.574 --> 24:37.710
we'll be losing
30-40% of our users
whenever we do it.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.046
It's just a matter
of how big you want to grow
the base beforehand.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.214
Man: And, unfortunately,
people are going to hate you
for a little while.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.684
Sorry,
couldn't be helped.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.086
Well, it's been a long time
since I cared what people
thought about me.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.889
My gut says...

24:52.258 --> 24:53.826
September.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.862
What's our price point?

24:55.895 --> 24:58.297
Man #2:
If we can stay below
the $15 threshold,

24:58.330 --> 25:00.633
consumers seem willing
to shine it on.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.269
Man:
Oof, that sounds awfully high.
Can't we keep it under 10?

25:03.302 --> 25:06.238
Man #2:
No, the fact is for a one-time
annual expense of this kind--

25:06.272 --> 25:08.040
$14.95.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.744
Yes. That.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.312
That right there.
That--

25:13.345 --> 25:15.982
that has my vote.
Yes, please.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.250
What do you think?

25:24.223 --> 25:26.959
Yeah, I-I guess

25:26.993 --> 25:29.261
$14.95 sounds good.

25:32.599 --> 25:35.835
Well, if Ryan's
on board, huh?

25:38.270 --> 25:39.806
So that's it.

25:39.839 --> 25:43.542
Come September,
we start charging $14.95.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.786
( door opens )

25:55.254 --> 25:57.089
- You okay?
- Yeah, of course.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.827
Look, I know
it tastes bad,

26:00.860 --> 26:02.762
but this is
the right move.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.764
- Mmm.
- I promise you,
all right?

26:10.136 --> 26:11.938
( door closes )

26:29.421 --> 26:31.590
( knocks )

26:32.859 --> 26:34.627
Gordon:
Can I come in?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.864
What is it?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.901
Hey, I--

26:41.934 --> 26:46.238
I just wanted to say
that even though it does
make perfect sense

26:46.272 --> 26:49.108
to hire the person
who wrote that code,

26:49.141 --> 26:53.680
I didn't realize that
that was someone that
you had a thing with.

26:53.713 --> 26:57.650
So if I seemed insensitive
earlier today,

26:57.684 --> 26:58.985
I'm sorry.

27:00.753 --> 27:01.688
Okay.

27:03.990 --> 27:07.727
And just--
Tom and I wrote
that code together.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.730
Just, you know, FYI.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.164
It wasn't all him.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.066
Okay.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.738
And I hope I didn't
make you feel

27:18.771 --> 27:21.173
like you living here
is the cause of all
of our problems.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.676
You're not gonna
start talking to me
about your wife, are you?

27:23.710 --> 27:25.311
No, I'm not.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.246
Just 'cause I really--
I don't think I can
handle that.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.282
Look,
I still don't think

27:30.316 --> 27:33.152
that we should all be living
under the same roof,

27:33.185 --> 27:37.389
but obviously there's
something else going on.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.859
That's all
I wanted to say.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.928
So when are you guys
moving out?

27:41.961 --> 27:44.663
( both laugh )

27:46.298 --> 27:50.336
Jesus, you got
every goddamn mug
in the house in here.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.938
No, I don't.

27:51.971 --> 27:55.141
All right.
Hey, good luck tonight.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.809
You, too.

28:01.047 --> 28:04.416
I just don't understand
how the wind gets into
Candlestick.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.418
- I mean, there are walls.
- ( Doug laughs )

28:06.452 --> 28:09.288
Wind's a Giants fan.
It does what it
needs to do.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.724
It beats the hell
out of sweating bullets
in Arlington.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.459
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm a Houston fan.

28:13.492 --> 28:15.494
Air conditioning
like God intended it.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.730
Where was God
when Nolan Ryan

28:17.764 --> 28:19.766
left that one
hanging for Will Clark
the other day?

28:19.799 --> 28:23.435
( phone ringing )

28:23.469 --> 28:26.138
You want to get that?

28:26.172 --> 28:28.040
No, it's fine.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.776
This is more important.

28:29.809 --> 28:33.079
( ringing continues )

28:33.112 --> 28:35.815
Yeah, hey, we appreciate
the extra attention,

28:35.848 --> 28:38.284
but don't you fellas
have a receptionist?

28:38.317 --> 28:41.187
Of course we do.
She's at lunch.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.522
- Late lunch.
- We do a lot of business
with the East Coast.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.859
So we work through
lunch a lot and then we,
you know, have it later.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.195
Can somebody answer
the goddamn phone?

28:49.228 --> 28:52.198
Everybody's really
spent from last night.
It was a real ball-breaker.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.066
Yeah.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.968
Sure.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.308
What'd you do that for?

29:02.341 --> 29:04.043
Oh, I'm not
comfortable with it.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.012
No, it was a figure
that was arrived at

29:06.045 --> 29:08.480
when we were operating
with less than current
information.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.350
The value
of our company is in our
intellectual property,

29:11.383 --> 29:13.219
our loyal customers,
it's not out there.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.054
No, it sure
as hell isn't.
Come on.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.823
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

29:16.856 --> 29:18.925
Oh, we need
to reassess.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.861
Mr. Bosworth,
I assure you the company
you're bidding on

29:21.894 --> 29:24.230
is a lean, mean
version of itself.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.166
Oh, I'd say
it's a lean, mean version
worth about 400K.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.037
400,000 sounds like
a good place to start.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.439
No, it sounds
like a good place
to finish, son.

29:33.472 --> 29:36.375
If you can find someone
willing to pay north of 350,
you should go for it.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.978
- Wait, he just said 400.
- Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.

29:39.011 --> 29:42.081
- 325, how's that sound?
- ( phone ringing )

29:46.618 --> 29:49.121
We just saved you
$250,000.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.389
I'd think
you'd be happier.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.092
I am happy, very.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.194
I'm just
a little surprised

29:55.227 --> 29:57.263
by how completely
off-book you went.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.032
I thought this was
supposed to be handshakes
and how do you dos.

30:00.066 --> 30:03.069
You see an opportunity,
you take it.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.536
That's the sport of it.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.811
It could have gone
the other way.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.215
But it didn't.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.322
( engine starts )

30:58.257 --> 31:00.559
- ( knocks )
- Mr. MacMillan?

31:03.629 --> 31:08.434
Uh, I just wanted
to say that--

31:08.467 --> 31:11.203
that I don't think you should
charge for the user version.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.940
Why didn't you say that
in the meeting?

31:13.973 --> 31:16.075
I've been here
for, what, a week

31:16.108 --> 31:18.210
and you plunk me down
in some senior staff meeting.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.546
What was I supposed to say?
I just agreed with
everyone else.

31:23.382 --> 31:27.053
But that's not right
because it's not
what I think.

31:27.086 --> 31:30.089
I'm sorry you couldn't
keep up in the meeting.

31:30.122 --> 31:34.493
You made a promise
to people that you
wouldn't charge them.

31:34.526 --> 31:37.096
I didn't promise
that I wouldn't ever
charge them.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.530
Of course you did.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.267
You said freedom
from fear is a right

31:41.300 --> 31:42.969
and you shouldn't
have to pay for it.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.104
And in a perfect world
that would be true,

31:45.137 --> 31:47.940
but it's not the world
we live in.

31:47.974 --> 31:51.043
- Then why'd you say it?
- Because I believe it.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.017
But I've got a board
and investors

31:58.050 --> 32:01.587
and I've got people
to answer to.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.056
But you're ruining
the product.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.025
I am the product.

32:23.409 --> 32:24.276
"The Boy in the Bubble"
playing

32:29.548 --> 32:33.285
* It was a slow day
and the sun was beating *

32:33.319 --> 32:36.555
* On the soldiers
by the side of the road *

32:36.588 --> 32:38.624
* There was a bright light

32:38.657 --> 32:40.592
* A shattering
of shop windows *

32:40.626 --> 32:44.430
* The bomb in the baby carriage
was wired to the radio *

32:44.463 --> 32:48.034
* These are the days
of miracle and wonder *

32:48.067 --> 32:51.303
* This is
the long distance call *

32:51.337 --> 32:55.241
* The way the camera
follows us in slo-mo *

32:55.274 --> 32:58.677
* The way we look
to us all *

32:58.710 --> 33:01.380
* The way we look
to a distant constellation *

33:01.413 --> 33:05.517
* That's dying
in a corner of the sky *

33:05.551 --> 33:08.687
* These are the days
of miracle and wonder *

33:08.720 --> 33:12.424
* And don't cry, baby,
don't cry, don't cry *

33:26.105 --> 33:28.040
* It was dry wind

33:28.074 --> 33:29.641
* And it swept across
the desert *

33:29.675 --> 33:33.079
* And it curled into
the circle of birth *

33:33.112 --> 33:36.648
* And the dead sand
falling on the children... *

33:38.117 --> 33:39.818
Cameron:
No, I was
at Austin Tech.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.454
I never really finished,
but then I started working

33:42.488 --> 33:44.556
and there was just
no real time to go back.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.658
Man:
Thanks again for coming.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.195
Yeah.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.775
Feel free to start.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.833
( engine stops )

34:56.862 --> 34:58.497
What, no kiss
this time?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.372
What do you want?

35:09.275 --> 35:11.710
You gonna tell me
I'm a horrible person?
Go ahead.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.513
I'd be well within
my rights to want that.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.551
What I'd really
like to say is--

35:21.853 --> 35:23.522
is thank you.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.693
Really?

35:27.726 --> 35:29.495
For what?

35:29.528 --> 35:31.530
Everything,
I guess.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.868
How could I have
risen from the ashes

35:36.902 --> 35:38.670
if you hadn't burned
it all to the ground?

35:41.540 --> 35:43.809
Is that why you stole
my best coder?

35:43.842 --> 35:47.379
Who, Ryan?
Come on.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.615
The Valley
is crawling with Ryans.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.618
No, actually,
he's incredibly talented.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.154
Do you want him back?

35:58.790 --> 36:01.960
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me here?

36:01.993 --> 36:05.831
No, Cam, I don't have
time to follow you.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.236
I'm a--

36:10.269 --> 36:11.770
I'm a student.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.507
( laughs )

36:15.541 --> 36:17.276
Why is that funny?

36:17.309 --> 36:20.246
Because it's a lie.

36:20.279 --> 36:23.582
Well, maybe I got tired
of being told

36:23.615 --> 36:25.651
I was just a salesman
who couldn't code.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.586
Okay.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.256
I--

36:30.289 --> 36:33.292
God, I don't know
what kind of dress-up
game you're playing,

36:33.325 --> 36:34.693
but, yes,
you're a student.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.595
I might not ever
be great at it, but...

36:38.997 --> 36:41.333
I'm not unteachable.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.704
Joe,

36:45.737 --> 36:48.807
I know you got this
whole humble Zen master
thing working for you,

36:48.840 --> 36:51.277
but come on.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.744
Save it.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.348
I'm not buying it.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.288
You don't have
to buy it, Cam.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.290
Haven't you heard?

37:18.804 --> 37:19.070
( clicking )

37:26.545 --> 37:28.380
Bosworth:
Cam.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.319
Cam.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.487
How were they
last night?

37:35.521 --> 37:37.889
I didn't see them.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.792
They were in their room
when I got home and gone
before I left this morning.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.694
It was quiet.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.496
Yeah, that's not always
a good sign.

37:44.530 --> 37:45.897
Well, it's better
than screaming.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.066
I've heard quiet
make you beg for screaming.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.337
"Leaving You" playing

37:57.643 --> 38:00.078
- Put that there.
- ( clears throat )

38:00.111 --> 38:01.613
Hey.

38:04.950 --> 38:09.455
I want to apologize
for my outburst yesterday.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.057
It was totally
inappropriate.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.362
And it shouldn't
have happened.

38:16.395 --> 38:19.598
So if I made anyone
feel uncomfortable,

38:19.631 --> 38:21.066
then I'm sorry.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.005
Well, that little speech
made me very uncomfortable.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.442
- I'm kidding.
- It never happened.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.043
- Come on.
- What?

38:32.077 --> 38:33.979
- It so clearly did.
- It's a thing you say.

38:34.012 --> 38:37.048
Okay, look, we don't have
to discuss this ad nauseam,

38:37.082 --> 38:39.885
but we thought
saying nothing
seemed equally stupid.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.587
So we're saying something.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.822
We are aware that bringing
a marriage into the workplace

38:43.855 --> 38:45.857
is complicated
and we're doing
the best we can, okay?

38:45.891 --> 38:47.793
Now, can we try to get
back to where we were?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.728
Okay, great.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.964
The big Ryan-shaped hole.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.501
Did you find
any prospects last night?

38:55.534 --> 38:58.537
No, but I decided
we don't need anyone.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.539
- Of course we do.
- No.

39:00.572 --> 39:01.707
Not if I do it.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.545
Oh, I don't know.
I feel like you're
already spread pretty thin.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.581
No, he was right.
Getting the person
who originated the code

39:09.615 --> 39:11.417
makes the most sense.
That's me.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.051
Well, but you should
have some help.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.053
We just bought a company.
Maybe one of them can help.

39:15.086 --> 39:18.156
No! Look, I'd just have to
explain everything to them.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.492
It makes double
the work for me.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.162
All right, if you think
you can handle it.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.064
Yes, I can.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.800
Okay, so we got a call--

39:28.834 --> 39:30.969
You got to be kidding me.
You're moving on?

39:31.002 --> 39:34.840
Yes.
Did you have something
you wanted to say?

39:37.609 --> 39:40.579
No. No, no, go ahead.
It's your meeting.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.984
- We got a call--
- She can't do it herself.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.687
The company spends
a third of its time
waiting for her as it is.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.922
He's not wrong.
You could do a bit
more delegating.

39:50.956 --> 39:54.192
I do, just not when it's
something that I think
is truly foundational.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.562
But you think
that everything
is foundational.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.597
Look, if she says
she can handle it,
she can handle it.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.066
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.968
Gordon, what is
your argument?

40:03.001 --> 40:06.505
You're just
sinking the company
by taking on all these--

40:06.538 --> 40:08.574
- No, she's not
sinking anything.
- Can we please just focus?

40:08.607 --> 40:11.710
( overlapping arguing )

40:19.518 --> 40:21.520
I want you
to pack up your stuff.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.759
Starting tomorrow,
we'll be working
out of my place.

40:29.795 --> 40:32.030
If we're not charging
for 2.0,

40:32.063 --> 40:34.165
we've got to find
a new income stream.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.904
Don't smile.
We might fail.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.206
"Burning Down the House"
playing

40:46.077 --> 40:49.781
* Ah, watch out

40:49.815 --> 40:52.250
* You might get
what you're after *

40:52.283 --> 40:54.686
* Cool babies

40:54.720 --> 40:57.623
* Strange
but not a stranger *

40:57.656 --> 41:02.127
* I'm an ordinary guy

41:06.932 --> 41:09.535
