Man: Previously on Revolution...

00:03.800 --> 00:06.314
Grace. I think I was sent here
to find you.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.232
Grace: She walked in late yesterday.

00:08.480 --> 00:09.914
- Priscilla.
- Aaron.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.991
- You know her?
- She was my wife.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.071
My father said I had to come.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.078
- Your dead father.
- I'm going crazy.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.918
Aaron: It's happening to you too,
of all people.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.714
- What? You've seen the fireflies?
- Fireflies.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.598
We're gonna figure it out
together, okay?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.319
<i>Bass: You took my son to Mexico?</i>

00:24.480 --> 00:25.470
Afternoon, folks.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.278
- You're Connor?
- Who the hell are you?

00:27.440 --> 00:29.477
I'm your dad.
You are a Monroe.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.199
You should be leading the Republic.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.239
You and me together,
we can take it back.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.357
- What happened?
- Someone broke into my office.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.113
They went through
all my files, through everything.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.355
<i>Julia: What were you thinking, Tom?</i>

00:39.520 --> 00:41.033
I don't know
what you are talking about.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.315
It wasn't you.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.794
Did you break into Doyle's office?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.280
- Yeah.
- We have to get you out of here.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.393
Jason Neville.
Come with us, son.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.040
What are they building?
And why so fast?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.958
- Gene: We gotta go in there.
- Freeze! Hold it!

00:56.120 --> 00:57.679
If you're gonna kill us,
just kill us.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.160
Afraid I need you.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.675
We had one case three days ago.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.069
- Now we have four.
- Gene: They have typhus.

01:04.239 --> 01:05.674
This is an outbreak.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.238
Charlie?

01:18.400 --> 01:19.834
Dad?

01:21.680 --> 01:22.715
Aaron?

01:24.440 --> 01:27.512
And all this time, I thought
I was living the life.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.637
Stuffs gone.
They cleared out.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.115
Oh, that's nice, Rachel.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.398
We're gone a week, and your dad
switches sides again?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.235
Look.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.913
Charlie.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.510
Miles: What's going on?

02:54.040 --> 02:57.158
Those masks,
and those are quarantine tents.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.594
Looks like an outbreak.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.758
(MAN SHOUTING, HORSE WHINNYING)

03:18.160 --> 03:20.754
Gene: Come on, I need four of you
over here. Right now! Right now!

03:20.920 --> 03:22.831
- Man: About ready inside?
- Woman: Standby.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.230
Gene: Keep it steady,
as steady as you can.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.198
- Man 1: Put him down?
- Man 2: No, straight back.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.077
Gene: Move! Move!

03:31.000 --> 03:31.990
Right here.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.869
Hold him down!

03:39.800 --> 03:41.871
- Man: Hold him.
- Charlie, get the bag.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.439
(PANTING)
Come on.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.754
Come on!

Come on!

04:09.400 --> 04:11.038
(snamwe)

04:18.000 --> 04:20.798
I want those wagons protected.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.234
I don't want anybody
interfering with you.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.630
You take all the men you need
and get it done. All right, go.

04:24.760 --> 04:25.830
Yeah?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.877
When is that azithromycin
getting here?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.679
- Three days.
- I don't have three days.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.717
I can't exactly FedEx it, Gene.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.279
We've already lost a dozen.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.670
I got my men laid up in there too.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.953
I might lose them.
I might lose the whole town.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.198
Look, I know how you feel about me.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.237
Frankly, I feel
the same way about you,

04:49.400 --> 04:53.075
but like it or not,
we're in this together.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.275
We have to get down there.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.319
And how are we gonna do that?
We can't exactly show our faces.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.996
If this is what I think it is,
we can't just sit here.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.396
Well, nobody knows the kid.
I say we send him.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.675
Yeah, hell no.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.831
I'm not walking into Plagueville,
but thank you.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.151
None of you are going.
It's my father, my daughter.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.152
- Rachel.
- I have to.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.038
I'm going.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.830
She's in.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.753
(SCOFFING)
You people are nuts.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.799
Thank God.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.792
So this is an outbreak?

06:33.640 --> 06:34.471
Yeah.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.836
- How bad?
- It's bad.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.113
And it's just getting started.
I could use your help.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.916
Where's Aaron?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.309
Truman: Rachel Matheson.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.876
This is quite the surprise.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.713
Where have you been, Rachel?

07:01.880 --> 07:07.034
And tell me, where's Miles?
Or Aaron Pittman?

07:09.520 --> 07:13.832
I came alone.
I have no idea where they are.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.399
That so?

07:16.160 --> 07:19.039
You want to stop this thing?
I need her help.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.839
We're all in this together.
Right? Isn't that what you said?

07:29.520 --> 07:30.635
Fine.

07:31.880 --> 07:36.351
But when this is over, you and I
are gonna have a little chat.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.274
- Well?
- It's your husband, all right.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.071
(SCOFFING)

08:11.200 --> 08:14.556
He's got Jason, under suspicion
of breaking into his office.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.394
- Where?
- I don't know.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.151
If the boy breaks,
he'll tell them everything...

08:28.000 --> 08:29.752
...about us.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.275
I don't care about any of that, Tom.

08:33.360 --> 08:37.318
He's our son, and we've got to find
out where he is and get him out.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.239
It's your husband doing it.
You're the best chance we got.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.110
Don't worry,
I'll find some food.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.639
If you don't soon,
we're gonna lose him, Tom.

I don't mean any harm.

My son, he's sick.

He's starving.

Just hand it over.

Okay, hold on.
Easy.

When was the last time you slept?

10:40.720 --> 10:42.757
I'll sleep later.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.877
So you're saying this is typhus?

10:45.080 --> 10:47.196
Because the patients
aren't responding

10:47.360 --> 10:48.873
to the fluids
the way they should.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.799

spreading the way it should either.

If I had time to run
a test or do anything...

11:00.760 --> 11:02.910
We're losing people by the hour.

This is...

Dad?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.913
This is the way I lost your mother.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.560
It's okay.
We'll fix this.

to be alone, she wasn't k...

You have to face it.

You can do anything
you want to me, okay?

be answered in Lubbock, Texas.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.956
...this is not
a naturally occurring typhus.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.037
The proteins were chemically tagged.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.151
This stuff was made in a lab.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.670
What are you saying?

14:59.840 --> 15:05.631
I think the Patriots started
this outbreak on purpose.

Patriots are behind all this?

I can't believe Truman

15:24.080 --> 15:26.799

Well, you know them better
than I do, you tell me.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.678
How do we stop it?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.470
I don't think they'd play
with something this dangerous

15:45.640 --> 15:48.154
without a cure on hand, a vaccine.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.354

...I think I know
where they'd keep it.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.676
But how do we get to it?
They're watching every move we make.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.679
We send a message.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.995
There it is.

Connor: Let me reiterate.
Screw both of you,

- with something pointy.
- Kid, we're desperate.

to raid their bunker

16:42.240 --> 16:44.709
to pick up some meds
that might not even be there?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.156
And what part of "desperate"
don't you understand?

16:47.320 --> 16:51.439

- I get it, believe me.

tells me to.

- No.

to keep on our side.

- Everything we spoke about.

that's what you want, right?

I won't.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.550
Hey.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.677
_ Okay.
<i>'</i> Dad!

40:27.840 --> 40:28.557
Rachel: Shh, shh.

40:28.680 --> 40:29.829
Okay, just relax.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.354
Okay, okay.

Charlie: It's okay.
(STRUGGLING)

40:44.680 --> 40:46.398
Just want you clear.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.551
You even think about
making a move,

40:48.720 --> 40:51.394
your brains hit the dirt
before you finish the thought.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.437
My men are pretty fast.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.079
I'm faster.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.069
Back away.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.070
Move.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.069
Move.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.278
It's in the back.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.437
Let me take mine.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.877
After you get me back out of town.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.754

41:59.000 --> 42:00.274
(DOOR BANGS)
