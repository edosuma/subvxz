<i>( Thunder crashes )</i>

00:29.855 --> 00:32.973
O Mighty Father, we pray for
the soul of Edmund Hewlett,

00:32.975 --> 00:34.775
<i>a kind and gentle man.</i>

00:34.810 --> 00:37.144
You make it sound as if he's dead.

00:37.196 --> 00:39.563
<i>( Thunder rumbling )</i>

00:39.615 --> 00:41.482
If the rebels had wanted that,

00:41.484 --> 00:42.866
they would have done it right here.

00:42.902 --> 00:44.485
<i>( Door opens )</i>

00:47.490 --> 00:49.373
<i>( door closes )</i>

00:53.009 --> 00:54.959
Captain Wakefield to see you, sir.

00:56.513 --> 00:59.430
- ( Gun clicks )
- Very well.

01:03.353 --> 01:05.970
- Good day.
- Have you word of the major?

01:06.022 --> 01:07.688
Have they requested a ransom?

01:13.696 --> 01:17.315
This is news best heard
by you alone, Your Honor.

01:17.367 --> 01:20.868
Whatever you tell me, they
will insist on hearing it.

01:21.988 --> 01:23.821
Very well.

01:23.823 --> 01:27.124
We've just received this
from the New York courier,

01:27.160 --> 01:29.494
addressed to Major Hewlett
from an Inspector Yates

01:29.496 --> 01:32.463
<i>of Livingston's prison inside the city.</i>

01:32.499 --> 01:35.666
It appears your son Abraham

01:35.668 --> 01:37.418
has been arrested as a spy,

01:37.470 --> 01:41.339
<i>having been found with treasonous
correspondence on his person.</i>

01:41.391 --> 01:44.008
- Aberdeen!
- He claims his innocence.

01:44.010 --> 01:47.728
Yes, swears he was operating under
direct sanction from the major

01:47.764 --> 01:50.064
in order to expose rebel activity.

01:50.099 --> 01:53.851
Inspector Yates requests Hewlett's
confirmation to prove this.

01:54.938 --> 01:56.638
I must ask, sir.

01:56.690 --> 01:58.723
Do you have any knowledge of this?

02:02.529 --> 02:04.229
Mm-mm.

02:10.402 --> 02:12.070
Only the major can settle this.

02:12.072 --> 02:13.655
<i>What news of him?</i>

02:14.624 --> 02:15.873
News?

02:15.909 --> 02:18.626
You know where the Continental outpost is.

02:18.662 --> 02:20.745
The major showed me himself
through his telescope.

02:20.797 --> 02:22.413
- Madam...
- So why are you still here?

02:22.465 --> 02:23.881
What is being done to rescue him?

02:23.917 --> 02:26.417
My orders are to hold this garrison.

02:26.469 --> 02:29.504
Diverting men across the sound
would leave Setauket vulnerable.

02:29.556 --> 02:32.090
So you're afraid, then?
You're afraid of the rebels.

02:32.142 --> 02:34.425
The women are emotional.
They need time to recover.

02:34.427 --> 02:37.762
Thank you, Captain. Please, forgive us.

02:39.766 --> 02:42.350
<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

02:42.402 --> 02:45.770
This... he couldn't. Where
was Corporal Eastin?

02:45.772 --> 02:47.355
He was supposed to be watching Abraham,

02:47.407 --> 02:48.856
protecting him at all times.

02:48.908 --> 02:50.992
The major ordered Eastin to
leave him free in the city.

02:51.027 --> 02:53.911
He's most likely still there waiting
for Abe at the Brooklyn Ferry.

02:53.947 --> 02:55.780
So it is true.

02:55.782 --> 02:57.782
Abraham was spying for Hewlett.

02:58.918 --> 03:01.202
No.

03:02.372 --> 03:05.340
No, it is the furthest thing from true.

03:05.375 --> 03:09.344
But you already knew that, didn't you?

03:09.379 --> 03:12.046
- Father, please.
- Don't "Father" me. You knew it as well.

03:12.098 --> 03:13.464
Knew what?

03:13.516 --> 03:16.301
That your husband is a spy for the rebels.

03:16.303 --> 03:18.186
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

03:18.221 --> 03:21.139
That business over dinner when you
begged him not to go to the city.

03:21.141 --> 03:23.141
And last Christmas, you
didn't just come here

03:23.193 --> 03:25.226
because Thomas had the croup, did you?

03:25.278 --> 03:28.980
- Leave her be.
- Not a word from you!

03:28.982 --> 03:31.149
You have caused this family enough harm.

03:31.151 --> 03:33.534
And if I had the proof that
you were aiding the enemy,

03:33.570 --> 03:36.487
I would see you hanged as your
husband should have been.

03:36.539 --> 03:37.789
And my father, too, right?

03:37.824 --> 03:39.040
Damn right your father, too.

03:39.075 --> 03:42.076
That's what this has always been about.

03:42.128 --> 03:45.330
But the cold truth is that it is not I

03:45.382 --> 03:48.216
nor my family that turned your son from you.

03:48.251 --> 03:50.501
You can thank yourself for that.

03:52.088 --> 03:55.390
My son is in prison.

03:55.425 --> 03:58.559
And Major Hewlett is captured.

03:58.595 --> 04:02.096
There's no one left for you
to crawl into bed with here.

04:04.317 --> 04:06.851
Get out of my house.

04:06.903 --> 04:08.686
Now.

04:16.696 --> 04:18.079
( Crying ) Anna.

04:18.113 --> 04:21.165
<i>You know how fast word travels here.</i>

04:22.836 --> 04:24.952
Please keep this quiet until we know more.

Abe, you dumb bastard.

06:57.589 --> 07:02.789
__

07:02.789 --> 07:04.850
Right, so I guess it didn't go well, then.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.770
- I'm being transferred.
- He's dismissing you from camp?

07:07.822 --> 07:10.072
I'm no longer head of intelligence.

07:10.107 --> 07:12.858
Just goes to show he ain't got
no head for intelligence himself.

07:12.894 --> 07:14.493
He blames me for Abe going rogue.

07:14.529 --> 07:16.161
He says if I couldn't command obedience

07:16.197 --> 07:17.780
from a friend handpicked for the task,

07:17.832 --> 07:20.199
then what hope do I have of
gaining it from any other asset?

07:20.201 --> 07:22.668
Well, I'm an asset, aren't I?

07:22.703 --> 07:25.371
Not that I always do
what you tell me, right.

07:25.423 --> 07:28.207
Come the new year, I'm being sent to Boston

07:28.259 --> 07:30.543
to appraise the status of their defenses.

07:30.595 --> 07:32.094
What horse shite!

07:32.129 --> 07:33.629
It's a good thing Abe's in prison,

07:33.681 --> 07:36.098
otherwise I'd strangle the bastard
with my own bare hands.

07:36.133 --> 07:37.766
How could he just lie to us like that?

07:37.802 --> 07:39.268
Calm down.

07:39.303 --> 07:40.970
You lie to him all the time, Ben.

07:41.022 --> 07:42.471
We both did right from the beginning.

07:42.523 --> 07:43.856
No, this is different.

07:43.891 --> 07:45.357
Pretending to be a double agent,

07:45.393 --> 07:47.560
he's caught himself in his own damn web.

07:47.562 --> 07:50.896
Hey! Now, that's just a
waste of good Madeira.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.198
It's over, Caleb. It's all over.

07:53.234 --> 07:56.402
Would you just calm down? It's not over.

07:57.905 --> 08:00.956
According to Anna, if we get
Hewlett back to Setauket,

08:00.992 --> 08:03.158
he can release Abe from prison, right?

08:03.210 --> 08:05.961
And then we're back in business.

08:05.997 --> 08:08.664
So where is Major Hewlett?

08:08.716 --> 08:10.633
Our defender of Long Island?

08:10.668 --> 08:13.836
Being held at an outpost near New Haven.

08:13.888 --> 08:16.472
He's been found guilty
of wartime atrocities.

08:16.507 --> 08:17.973
- Atrocities?
- Yeah, that's right.

08:18.009 --> 08:19.558
They said that he murdered their commander,

08:19.594 --> 08:22.678
wrote a note in his blood,
and pinned his tongue to it.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.314
They were quite specific, and now
they're calling for Washington

08:25.349 --> 08:27.316
to sign off on his execution.

08:27.351 --> 08:29.401
Well, the man did try and
blow me up with his cannon,

08:29.437 --> 08:32.270
but he never at all
seemed to me like a fiend.

08:32.323 --> 08:35.107
No, he released my father,
he arrested Simcoe,

08:35.159 --> 08:36.191
he held to our truce.

08:36.243 --> 08:37.275
He seemed like a man of honor.

08:37.278 --> 08:38.611
Well, did you tell that to Washington?

08:38.613 --> 08:40.913
( Scoffs ) No.

08:40.948 --> 08:43.782
He hasn't decided what to do yet.

08:43.833 --> 08:47.453
But he does not feel compelled
to free an alleged murderer

08:47.505 --> 08:50.506
on behalf of a failed spy.

08:50.541 --> 08:53.425
Maybe we make up his mind for him.

08:54.629 --> 08:57.630
If Hewlett's still there come the new year,

08:57.632 --> 09:00.799
we can make a detour on
the way to Boston, right?

09:00.801 --> 09:02.434
Outrank those New Haven boys.

09:02.470 --> 09:05.604
They're not likely to just hand him over.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.473
Right.

09:07.475 --> 09:09.942
Well, then, we kidnap him ourselves.

09:09.977 --> 09:13.028
Make it look like those
lobsters stole him back.

09:14.148 --> 09:16.982
- Just the two of us?
- Yeah.

09:18.736 --> 09:21.403
If Washington found out, he'd...

09:21.455 --> 09:23.489
He'd come round.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.991
Abe isn't just Abe.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.993
He's Culper.

09:27.995 --> 09:29.878

09:29.914 --> 09:31.830
Get in there!

09:41.308 --> 09:44.843
This colonel you asked
me to write... Hewett.

09:44.895 --> 09:48.764
Hewlett. Major Edmund Hewlett.

09:50.685 --> 09:52.184
Is that from him?

09:52.236 --> 09:54.603
What, this? ( laughs ) No.

09:54.655 --> 09:57.489
This is from a Captain Wakefield.

09:57.525 --> 09:59.158
Your man's second.

10:00.327 --> 10:01.944
Wakefield?

10:01.996 --> 10:03.696
Guess what.

10:08.753 --> 10:13.338
Your friend, your Major
Hewlett was kidnapped by rebels

10:13.374 --> 10:16.375
the same night that you were caught.

10:16.377 --> 10:18.544
<i>Quite a coincidence, that.</i>

10:18.596 --> 10:20.879
No, that... that can't be.

10:20.931 --> 10:23.382
And this Wakefield,

10:23.384 --> 10:25.768
he has no idea what you're gobbing on about.

10:25.803 --> 10:28.637
All right, then, you've got
to contact my father, right?

10:28.689 --> 10:30.439
My father's a judge. He's Richard Woodhull.

10:30.474 --> 10:32.057
He's the magistrate. He can vouch for me.

10:32.059 --> 10:36.061
Papa can't save you. No one can.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.947
We've wasted seven bloody days

10:38.983 --> 10:41.033
on this charade, Mr. Woodhull.

10:41.068 --> 10:42.201
It's time to confess!

10:42.236 --> 10:43.869
Look, I already told you the truth.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.738
All right? I put my hand on the Bible.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.323
I took an oath before God to serve the king.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.875
All right, please!

10:51.796 --> 10:53.879
- Come on, go.
- No! Richard Woodhull!

10:53.914 --> 10:56.248
He's my father.

10:57.301 --> 10:59.384
- Come on.
- You all right, Abe?

10:59.420 --> 11:02.921
Listen up, you sorry rebel traitors.

11:02.923 --> 11:07.559
Something about our Mr. Woodhull
he may not have told you yet.

11:07.595 --> 11:10.763
He took an oath to the king

11:10.765 --> 11:12.431

She sends me things, I send her things.

Though they not really from me.

Miss Anna, she writes letters for me

12:55.064 --> 12:57.698
since I can't do it myself.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.650
Anna: <i>Cicero.</i>

Luke, if you and Cicero will
bring my things upstairs.

13:04.907 --> 13:07.124
I believe the northeast
bedroom is still unoccupied.

13:07.159 --> 13:09.993
That's all right. I'll assist her.

13:10.045 --> 13:13.080
Mrs. Strong, it's good to see you.

13:13.132 --> 13:15.332
Does this mean you'll be
taking up residence again?

13:15.384 --> 13:17.801
Uh, I didn't feel comfortable

13:17.837 --> 13:19.253
at Whitehall after the major's kidnapping.

13:19.255 --> 13:21.922
I can only imagine how
shocking that must have been.

13:21.924 --> 13:25.175
If anything had happened to you,
I never could have forgiven myself.

13:25.227 --> 13:28.479
Of course, now you're back, I insist
you take your former quarters.

13:28.514 --> 13:31.398
Thank you, but I'll be fine
with one of the smaller rooms.

13:31.433 --> 13:33.433
Nonsense.

13:34.937 --> 13:38.238
- Here we go.
- Captain, wait.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.111
There we are.

13:44.113 --> 13:45.445
I'll have my things out in a jiff.

13:45.498 --> 13:47.447
Captain Simcoe, I don't
want to inconvenience you.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.250
- It's no inconvenience.
- I do not wish to stay in this room.

13:50.286 --> 13:52.286
Why can't you just respect my wishes?

13:52.288 --> 13:54.922
Because I don't wish to see you make
another decision you'll come to regret,

13:54.957 --> 13:58.175
<i>such as moving to
Whitehall in the first place.</i>

13:58.210 --> 14:00.794
<i>I warned you you wouldn't be safe there.</i>

14:00.846 --> 14:03.380
Major Hewlett has proved himself

14:03.432 --> 14:05.766
incapable of defending this town

14:05.801 --> 14:08.101
<i>even with an entire company at his disposal.</i>

14:08.137 --> 14:10.220
He is a fine officer and a gentleman.

14:10.272 --> 14:12.723
He is weak, a quill-pushing clerk

14:12.775 --> 14:14.858
<i>unsuited to the rigors of war.</i>

14:14.894 --> 14:17.144
And you are not half the man he is.

14:22.535 --> 14:24.368
That was a very rude thing to say.

14:24.403 --> 14:26.486
Or perhaps you're just
unused to hearing the truth

14:26.539 --> 14:29.623
from those you can bully and intimidate.

14:29.658 --> 14:31.825
So I will speak plain, Captain.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.877
I do not love you.

14:33.913 --> 14:36.330
I never will.

14:36.332 --> 14:38.165
I may have lost my home,

14:38.167 --> 14:40.167
the protection of a husband,

14:40.219 --> 14:42.336
and what little standing I had in this town,

14:42.388 --> 14:44.471
but if there's anything
left of me that you want,

14:44.506 --> 14:47.925
you will have to take it because
I'll give you nothing of me, ever.

14:47.977 --> 14:50.644
( Gasps )

14:50.679 --> 14:52.846
Go on, get it over with.

14:52.898 --> 14:55.232
I expect at least it will be quick.

15:05.444 --> 15:07.828
You wrong me, madam.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.163
( Breathing heavily )

15:18.757 --> 15:20.457
Thank you, Abigail.

15:20.509 --> 15:23.377
I find it exhausting to move about
this city without being noticed.

15:23.429 --> 15:26.013
- The rain helps.
- Does it?

15:26.048 --> 15:28.599
Oh, I wish Freddy were here.

15:28.634 --> 15:31.385
And who is this Freddy whom you long for?

15:31.387 --> 15:34.688
My coiffeur. You know Freddy.

15:34.723 --> 15:37.557
I loathe to hear any man's
name cross your lips.

15:37.559 --> 15:41.778
Believe me, you don't have
to worry about Freddy.

15:41.814 --> 15:44.898
Abigail, thank you for
bringing this vision to me.

15:49.204 --> 15:52.322
Abigail knows all sorts of routes
and back alleys to conceal us.

15:52.374 --> 15:54.658
My father retired later than usual tonight.

15:54.710 --> 15:56.326
You're here now.

15:56.378 --> 15:58.745
And I have a surprise for you.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.583
<i>( Thunder crashes )</i>

16:12.928 --> 16:16.063
( playing )

16:51.633 --> 16:53.433
Not to your taste?

16:54.770 --> 16:57.521
I did not wish it to end.

16:57.556 --> 16:59.973
Who is the composer?

17:00.025 --> 17:02.142
Handel? Haydn?

17:03.062 --> 17:04.728
No, no, no, I'm afraid.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.396
Some novice by the name of John André.

17:06.448 --> 17:09.366
His first composition if I'm not mistaken.

17:09.401 --> 17:11.034
Oh, John.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.071
I don't know what to say.

17:15.124 --> 17:17.290
You don't have to say anything.

17:17.326 --> 17:20.660
A muse needs only to be in
order to inspire mortal man

17:20.662 --> 17:22.913
to reach for something greater than himself.

17:31.724 --> 17:34.508
- <i> ( Knocking )</i>
- My father.

17:34.510 --> 17:35.509
It can't be.

17:35.511 --> 17:37.177
I told him I was staying with Becky,

17:37.229 --> 17:39.396
but he must have had me followed.

17:39.431 --> 17:41.231
Abigail.

17:43.068 --> 17:44.735
Get her out of sight. I'll get the door.

17:44.770 --> 17:47.104
It's a Lieutenant Gamble
here to see you, sir.

17:47.156 --> 17:49.606
The only other person that
makes sense at this hour.

17:49.658 --> 17:52.943
And who is this Gamble who visits so late?

17:52.995 --> 17:55.078
A man with news I have to hear.

17:55.114 --> 17:56.580
But it shouldn't take long.

17:56.615 --> 17:59.032
All the same, I think it's
better if you weren't seen.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.034
We can wait upstairs.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.340
I need your help with something.

18:10.929 --> 18:12.929
- Come on.
- <i> ( thunder rumbles )</i>

18:14.600 --> 18:17.551
- It's good to see you alive.
- It's good to be alive.

18:18.387 --> 18:21.388
( Both laughing )

18:24.560 --> 18:26.860
- André: Is this blood?
- Not mine.

18:26.895 --> 18:29.312
From a civilian assigned to debrief me.

18:29.364 --> 18:31.648
A Mr. Nathaniel Sackett.

18:31.700 --> 18:35.735
Sir, the first question
he asked me was about you.

18:35.788 --> 18:38.155
They know you're the
army's head of intelligence.

18:38.207 --> 18:39.656
But theirs was a civilian?

18:39.708 --> 18:42.459
No, he seemed an advisor.

18:42.494 --> 18:44.461
My main interrogation came at the hands

18:44.496 --> 18:46.246
of a Major Benjamin Tallmadge.

18:46.248 --> 18:48.915
- Major now, is he?
- You know him?

18:48.917 --> 18:51.301
Of him and of his interrogation methods.

18:51.336 --> 18:53.253
You look like you escaped the worst of them.

18:56.746 --> 18:59.003
__

18:59.928 --> 19:02.896
This is an estimate of our naval
strength in New York Harbor.

19:02.931 --> 19:05.098
And the numbers are accurate.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.933
Washington has a man inside New York?

19:06.985 --> 19:09.186
No, he mentions surveying the ships

19:09.238 --> 19:10.687
from the Brooklyn Ferry on his way home.

19:10.739 --> 19:14.107
This Samuel Culper must live on Long Island.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.909
Perhaps close to the city.

19:15.944 --> 19:17.744
Oyster Bay, Flatbush.

19:17.779 --> 19:19.613
I can ride for New York come morning.

19:19.665 --> 19:22.282
There's no need. I already
have an asset on Long Island.

19:22.284 --> 19:25.285
Captain Simcoe has quartered the
Queen's Rangers there for winter.

19:25.287 --> 19:29.539
I'll have him scour the
island for this Culper fellow.

19:29.591 --> 19:31.341
You stay on your current mission.

19:41.053 --> 19:42.018
<i>The coast is clear.</i>

19:42.054 --> 19:43.436
<i>You can send Miss Shippen down.</i>

19:43.472 --> 19:46.223
She asked to see you upstairs.

20:07.129 --> 20:09.079
How was your meeting?

20:10.332 --> 20:12.999
I hope you didn't end
it sooner on my behalf.

20:15.504 --> 20:17.087
That was business.

20:17.139 --> 20:18.922
This is far more important.

20:26.764 --> 20:29.727
( Men laughing )

20:33.290 --> 20:36.207
Mary.

20:36.259 --> 20:39.127
- What are you doing here?
- Is there somewhere else we can talk?

20:42.215 --> 20:45.466
I've already written to everyone
I could think of who could help...

20:45.519 --> 20:48.720
Colonel Floyd, Mr. Loring
the Commissary of Prisoners.

20:48.772 --> 20:50.688
I even tried writing General Clinton

20:50.724 --> 20:52.473
and General Howe in Philadelphia.

20:52.475 --> 20:54.192
Have you heard back from any of them?

20:54.227 --> 20:58.396
Just a reply from Floyd's aide
acknowledging that he received my letter.

20:58.448 --> 21:02.150
But I suppose it's all I should
expect as the wife of a traitor.

21:02.152 --> 21:05.820
Is that how you see yourself?

21:05.872 --> 21:07.989
My letters aren't working.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.826
So I was hoping that you
could write to the people

21:11.878 --> 21:14.662
that you know on the rebel side.

21:16.299 --> 21:18.666
I have no contact with the rebels.

21:21.087 --> 21:24.839
Now I should get back before Mr.
DeJong decides to dock my pay.

21:24.841 --> 21:26.808
Anna!

21:26.843 --> 21:30.311
I am doing all I can to
get Abe out of prison.

21:30.347 --> 21:32.847
And if your feelings for him
are even half of his for you,

21:32.899 --> 21:35.400
then you would do the same.

21:36.937 --> 21:39.854
I don't care if you're a Patriot.

21:39.856 --> 21:41.606
All I care about is freeing Abraham.

21:41.658 --> 21:43.608
And if Hewlett is being
held by the Patriots,

21:43.660 --> 21:45.360
then you should write them.

21:51.451 --> 21:53.534
I did.

21:58.842 --> 22:00.842
I haven't heard back.

22:06.766 --> 22:09.550
If they won't release him or trade him,

22:09.552 --> 22:11.052
then he must be rescued.

22:11.104 --> 22:13.221
You know I've already asked
Wakefield. You were there.

22:13.273 --> 22:16.641
- What about Simcoe?
- Simcoe?

22:16.693 --> 22:19.227
The only person he hates
more than Abe is Hewlett.

22:19.229 --> 22:21.729
The only person he cares for is you.

22:21.781 --> 22:24.315
Not anymore.

22:24.367 --> 22:26.234
The day I came back here,

22:26.236 --> 22:28.653
I told the man what I really thought of him.

22:28.705 --> 22:30.154
Perhaps you could talk to him instead.

22:30.206 --> 22:31.656
If he truly despises Abraham,

22:31.708 --> 22:34.242
he's not going to want
to hear from his wife.

22:35.912 --> 22:38.796
Besides, I don't have anything he wants.

22:38.832 --> 22:40.832
You do.

22:45.722 --> 22:48.723
If I go to Simcoe,

22:48.758 --> 22:52.060
then you need to go to the only
other man who can get Abe free...

22:52.095 --> 22:53.928
His father.

22:53.930 --> 22:56.264
The judge could vouch for
Abe's story if he wanted to.

22:56.316 --> 22:59.350
He's barely said three words
to me in the last two weeks.

22:59.402 --> 23:02.270
He's been very stubborn.

23:02.322 --> 23:05.239
You know how to handle
stubborn men, don't you?

23:11.081 --> 23:12.780
Thank you.

23:21.124 --> 23:23.041
Thank you.

23:26.429 --> 23:28.513
Abigail.

23:28.548 --> 23:31.299
I believe this is for you.

23:31.301 --> 23:34.385
Appears to be a gift from your son.

23:34.437 --> 23:36.688
I didn't know he could write.

23:36.723 --> 23:39.607
Someone must have written it for him, sir.

23:39.642 --> 23:41.642
What does it say?

23:41.644 --> 23:45.363
"Cicero 1777."

23:45.398 --> 23:48.316
Ironic since his namesake was responsible

23:48.318 --> 23:50.485
for introducing the art
of refined letter writing

23:50.487 --> 23:52.537
into European culture.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.211
"Silence is one of the great
arts of conversation."

24:01.798 --> 24:04.382
Marcus Tullius Cicero.

24:05.802 --> 24:07.752
Thank you.

24:39.085 --> 24:40.868
This ain't you.

24:53.216 --> 24:56.017
Ben's voice: <i>"Madam, the
information you recently transmitted</i>

24:56.052 --> 24:59.637
<i>has come to my attention and I in
turn relayed it to General Washington.</i>

24:59.689 --> 25:02.273
<i>He found it intriguing, but
asked that I take further steps</i>

25:02.308 --> 25:04.642
<i>to verify the context in
which you came across it</i>

25:04.694 --> 25:07.478
<i>as well as communicate various
standards and procedures</i>

25:07.530 --> 25:10.398
<i>for you to follow in conveying
additional intelligence.</i>

25:10.400 --> 25:12.066
<i>Further... "</i>

26:00.211 --> 26:02.211
Abigail.

26:03.932 --> 26:06.382
I'd like to talk to you about
something that's been troubling me.

26:06.434 --> 26:07.767
Please, sit.

26:21.649 --> 26:24.116
I grew up in a house full of servants.

26:24.152 --> 26:26.319
I know how they keep
an eye on their masters.

26:26.371 --> 26:29.572
- How they hear things. How they talk.
- I don't know.

26:29.574 --> 26:32.625
Abigail, I want you to
be very frank with me.

26:37.632 --> 26:39.915
Is John the jealous sort?

26:40.969 --> 26:42.752
Pardon?

26:42.754 --> 26:46.005
I recently received this letter
from another gentleman.

26:46.057 --> 26:48.341
I guess you could call
him a rival to the major.

26:48.393 --> 26:51.761
John is aware I wrote him,
but he might be taken aback

26:51.813 --> 26:54.313
by the tenor of his reply,
which could be perceived

26:54.349 --> 26:56.265
as the sentiments of an ardent suitor.

26:56.267 --> 26:58.601
- I know he likes to joke, but...
- Miss Shippen.

26:58.603 --> 27:00.987
Peggy. Peggy, please.

27:01.022 --> 27:05.775
Miss Peggy, I guess I'm confused.

27:05.827 --> 27:08.411
Why'd you write this man if he's a rival?

27:08.446 --> 27:11.280
And why do you have to
show his letter to the major?

27:12.667 --> 27:16.419
It's... complicated.

27:18.790 --> 27:21.707
You're afraid it's gonna
make him push you away.

27:21.759 --> 27:24.210
Yes.

27:26.381 --> 27:29.932
I haven't been with the major
that long, but one thing I know

27:29.967 --> 27:32.802
is that he values honesty very highly.

27:32.854 --> 27:35.554
More so than most gentlemen.

27:35.606 --> 27:37.139
Whatever that letter says,

27:37.141 --> 27:39.892
he won't think less of you for sharing it.

27:39.944 --> 27:41.310
You think so?

27:41.362 --> 27:44.613
He wouldn't have me smuggling
you across Philadelphia

27:44.649 --> 27:47.616
- if he didn't love you.
- ( laughs )

27:47.652 --> 27:50.986
I only wish I could tell someone
else about my love for him.

27:53.408 --> 27:54.707
Oh, what I mean is...

27:54.742 --> 27:57.543
A secret can be a burden.

28:00.498 --> 28:03.582
Thank you, Abigail.

28:12.176 --> 28:14.560
Do you know how this got here?

28:14.595 --> 28:16.512
The cook's son was playing with it.

28:16.514 --> 28:18.064
His mother made him put it back.

28:18.099 --> 28:20.399
Told him he's not to play
with Mr. Franklin's things.

28:20.435 --> 28:23.102
No, it was carved by my boy.

28:24.322 --> 28:25.938
You have a son? Where is he?

28:25.990 --> 28:29.575
He's on Long Island with my former mistress.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.495
You must miss him terribly.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.543
( Knocks )

28:55.052 --> 28:57.303
Mrs. Strong.

28:57.355 --> 28:58.971
To what do I owe the pleasure?

28:59.023 --> 29:00.890
Or have I perhaps offended you

29:00.892 --> 29:03.442
in some new way that I am as yet unaware of?

29:03.478 --> 29:05.895
I understand your anger, Captain,

29:05.897 --> 29:09.698
and I want to apologize
for being the cause of it.

29:11.068 --> 29:12.401
May I come in?

29:12.403 --> 29:15.654
You're not filled with
terror at my vengeful lust?

29:15.706 --> 29:19.575
Please, John, can we talk?

29:23.247 --> 29:25.047
I'd offer you a chair,

29:25.082 --> 29:27.917
but I wasn't expecting to
entertain company here.

29:33.257 --> 29:36.592
I'm ashamed of my words that day.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.677
You were being kind to me,

29:38.729 --> 29:41.096
thinking only of my comfort and welfare.

29:41.149 --> 29:45.518
<i>And I responded with vitriol.</i>

29:45.570 --> 29:49.655
In my defense, I can only
say that I was still reeling

29:49.690 --> 29:52.525
from the kidnapping at Whitehall.

29:52.577 --> 29:55.027
A distress aggravated by the loss

29:55.079 --> 29:56.829
of Major Hewlett's protection.

29:58.616 --> 30:02.284
When you offered me your
protection in his stead,

30:02.286 --> 30:05.871
it reminded me of all that I had lost.

30:06.791 --> 30:09.041
Particularly Edmund himself.

30:09.093 --> 30:11.877
Edmund?

30:11.929 --> 30:13.963
The major, I mean.

30:15.933 --> 30:19.935
During your absence, he
offered me his friendship.

30:19.971 --> 30:23.272
And, well...

30:24.192 --> 30:27.193
it grew into something else.

30:27.228 --> 30:29.528
Something romantic.

30:31.315 --> 30:33.949
I know this may come as a shock,

30:33.985 --> 30:36.735
but I came to care for him deeply.

30:39.407 --> 30:41.290
And to think...

30:43.995 --> 30:46.295
how he must be suffering.

30:51.335 --> 30:55.504
Captain Wakefield knows where
he's being held, but will do nothing.

30:55.556 --> 30:58.807
But you have your own
force of men and if you...

30:58.843 --> 31:01.560
You wish for me to rescue Major Hewlett?

31:01.596 --> 31:03.512
The man who had me court-martialed?

31:03.564 --> 31:07.149
I know the two of you have
had your disagreements.

31:07.184 --> 31:10.269
But what better way to show there's
no bad blood than by retrieving him?

31:10.321 --> 31:12.855
And whatever your differences,

31:12.907 --> 31:15.991
they pale beside those you
both have with the rebels.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.995
I'm indeed anxious to show my forgiveness,

31:20.031 --> 31:22.531
but I must also follow orders.

31:22.583 --> 31:26.252
I'm stationed here to hunt
for rebels in Long Island,

31:26.287 --> 31:28.537
not to make forays into
enemy-held Connecticut.

31:28.539 --> 31:32.958
In fact, I have orders to search
for a hidden traitor on Oyster Bay.

31:33.010 --> 31:34.677
We're to deploy next week.

31:34.712 --> 31:38.714
I would consider this a personal
favor of the highest order.

31:47.775 --> 31:51.443
If you were able to rescue the major,

31:51.479 --> 31:53.228
I would be deeply in your debt.

31:55.232 --> 31:59.068
Whatever favor you might
request from me in return,

31:59.120 --> 32:01.320
I would be obliged to fulfill.

32:03.574 --> 32:07.126
I've told you, madam,

32:07.161 --> 32:09.578
you have me all wrong.

32:11.165 --> 32:13.882
I'm a warrior, yes,

32:13.918 --> 32:16.552
but I'm not a monster.

32:18.389 --> 32:22.057
There's a heart beating inside me
that wants the same thing you do.

32:23.427 --> 32:25.427
To love

32:25.429 --> 32:27.596
and to be loved.

32:30.184 --> 32:33.102
- Forgive me.
- Good night, Mrs. Strong.

32:54.625 --> 32:57.459
<i>( Bird screeching )</i>

33:02.099 --> 33:05.267
Father, excuse me.

33:05.302 --> 33:08.103
I wondered if I might ask a favor.

33:09.774 --> 33:12.641
- Can you watch over Thomas for a few days?
- For a few days?

33:12.693 --> 33:15.194
Are you going to visit
your folk in this weather?

33:15.229 --> 33:18.647
My husband on York Island.

33:18.649 --> 33:20.282
To reassure myself that he's all right

33:20.317 --> 33:23.369
and to reassure him that his
family hasn't forgotten about him.

33:23.404 --> 33:27.005
Maybe give him some things to ease
his hardship... a warm cap, a Bible.

33:27.007 --> 33:30.142
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

33:30.177 --> 33:33.762
- You can't...
- A prison is no place for a woman.

33:33.814 --> 33:35.564
Isn't a wife's place at her husband's side?

33:35.599 --> 33:39.485
Abraham seems to have had little
interest in having you by his side of late.

33:43.324 --> 33:45.741
That was unkind.

33:45.776 --> 33:49.862
<i>Seems you have as little feeling
for me as you have for your son.</i>

33:49.864 --> 33:52.197
<i>Have you even written him since his arrest?</i>

33:55.202 --> 33:58.670
Surely you're not going to just
let him languish in there forever.

33:58.706 --> 34:00.255
They'll feed him,

34:00.291 --> 34:03.792
keep him clothed, and with Abe swearing

34:03.844 --> 34:06.211
he was sanctioned by Hewlett and
with Hewlett unaccounted for,

34:06.263 --> 34:07.963
they cannot move to sentence him.

34:08.014 --> 34:10.431
There's little else I can do.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.601
You can vouch for his story.

34:12.636 --> 34:15.771
The word of a father, that is
the very definition of bias.

34:15.806 --> 34:17.222
You're not just his father.

34:17.274 --> 34:19.274
You're a man of power and influence.

34:19.310 --> 34:20.559
Why won't you use it?

34:20.610 --> 34:23.061
Because he broke the law.
He committed treason.

34:23.063 --> 34:24.813
This is your son we're talking about.

34:24.864 --> 34:27.149
He's probably fearing for his life.

34:27.201 --> 34:30.152
Cold and starving and now
feeling utterly abandoned.

34:30.204 --> 34:32.237
If he was my son, I'd be doing
everything that I could to help him.

34:32.289 --> 34:34.656
And how would that teach him a lesson?

34:34.708 --> 34:37.626
Abraham should use this time to
reflect on the error of his ways,

34:37.661 --> 34:40.212
as perhaps you should reflect
on the error of yours.

34:45.418 --> 34:48.003
Mary, are you insane?!

34:48.054 --> 34:50.304
( Groans )

34:55.929 --> 34:58.597
You realize that is a year of my accounting?

34:58.599 --> 35:01.150
Yes, I'm sure your numbers
are very important to you.

35:01.185 --> 35:02.935
Just as Abraham's were to him.

35:02.937 --> 35:05.904
- <i> He was quite upset.</i>
- What are you talking about?

35:05.940 --> 35:08.524
His codebook.

35:08.576 --> 35:10.576
When I discovered it
after the raid last spring,

35:10.611 --> 35:13.195
I burned it, too, hoping it
would put an end to his spying.

35:14.448 --> 35:15.914
But, of course, that was before I helped him

35:15.950 --> 35:18.784
burn down our farm to cover up
his shooting of Ensign Baker,

35:18.836 --> 35:22.037
<i>who happened to have the misfortune
to walk in on our argument.</i>

35:22.089 --> 35:23.922
His shooting?

35:23.958 --> 35:26.258
I've done everything that
I could to protect him,

35:26.293 --> 35:28.460
everything I could to stop him.

35:28.512 --> 35:30.546
<i>But I have never abandoned him,</i>

35:30.598 --> 35:33.298
never stopped loving him, just
as a wife should her husband,

35:33.350 --> 35:34.967
<i>as a father should his son.</i>

35:35.019 --> 35:36.718
Murder.

35:36.770 --> 35:39.605
He's a soldier just like his brother.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.139
And while he may have picked the other side,

35:41.192 --> 35:43.475
at least he has principles
he's willing to fight for,

35:43.527 --> 35:46.979
which is more than I can say for you.

35:46.981 --> 35:49.031
I've lived in your house long enough to know

35:49.066 --> 35:51.366
when it comes to politics,
you're a businessman.

35:51.402 --> 35:52.985
You don't really believe in the king,

35:53.037 --> 35:56.205
you just believe the king's the safest bet.

35:56.240 --> 36:00.659
You need to choose between
your pride and your family.

36:00.711 --> 36:04.046
You've already lost one
son, don't lose another.

36:13.984 --> 36:15.767
André: Well, read it to me, then.

36:22.242 --> 36:24.659
"My Dear Miss Shippen,

36:24.695 --> 36:28.079
words cannot express the abundance
of joy that flooded my heart

36:28.115 --> 36:30.615
upon your congratulating me on my victory

36:30.617 --> 36:34.119
and wishing me a speedy recovery
from my wounds suffered in battle.

36:35.872 --> 36:37.455
I do, in fact, recall our meeting

36:37.457 --> 36:40.125
at your esteemed family's
gracious home in Philadelphia

36:40.127 --> 36:43.345
as if it were yesterday,
not four long years ago.

36:45.048 --> 36:48.016
Indeed, your beauty was as remarkable to me

36:48.051 --> 36:49.968
as it must have been for Paris

36:50.020 --> 36:52.304
the first time he beheld Helen of Troy."

36:52.306 --> 36:54.973
( laughs ) It seems General
Arnold missed his calling.

36:55.025 --> 36:57.108
Who knew he was a poet?

36:57.144 --> 36:59.144
- And you're not upset?
- Oh, on the contrary.

36:59.196 --> 37:02.530
I am very pleased. Here, allow me.

37:02.566 --> 37:05.483
( Loudly clears throat )

37:05.485 --> 37:08.703
"I recall your flaxen hair,
your curls as lovely

37:08.739 --> 37:10.989
as the golden rays of the rising sun.

37:11.041 --> 37:15.210
Indeed, to behold you is like
gazing upon Phoebus' orb itself."

37:15.245 --> 37:17.162
- ( laughs )
- Really? Wow.

37:17.164 --> 37:19.497
"One's eyes cannot stare too long

37:19.499 --> 37:23.251
without being blinded by the splendor."

37:23.303 --> 37:25.637
- Ha ha.
- Splendor.

37:25.672 --> 37:27.756
- Abigail was right.
- Oh, yeah?

37:27.808 --> 37:32.310
- She said you wouldn't be upset.
- You spoke of this with her?

37:32.346 --> 37:35.347
- I said it was from a rival suitor.
- Oh.

37:35.349 --> 37:39.234
I know better than to
discuss your business, John.

37:39.269 --> 37:41.353
Abigail merely urged me
to be forthright with you.

37:41.405 --> 37:44.489
She said you appreciated
honesty in those around you.

37:44.524 --> 37:47.158
An insightful woman,
especially for a servant.

37:47.194 --> 37:51.363
- She continues to surprise.
- She's been a great help to me, too.

37:51.365 --> 37:53.081
I have no one else to confide in.

37:53.116 --> 37:55.417
Hopefully we shall change that soon.

37:55.452 --> 37:58.503
- Hopefully?
- I'm not the one with the stubborn father.

37:58.538 --> 38:00.538
He just doesn't know you as I do.

38:00.540 --> 38:02.290
Thank God.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.313
<i>Abigail.</i>

38:25.365 --> 38:27.732
I didn't imagine you'd be working this late.

38:27.784 --> 38:30.735
I noticed the parlor was dusty, sir.

38:30.787 --> 38:35.290
Didn't feel right going to bed
with things looking untidy.

38:35.325 --> 38:38.326
Is it all right if I move your papers
so I can dust around them?

38:38.378 --> 38:40.378
Leave them be.

38:41.498 --> 38:42.797
<i>I was just looking for some ink,</i>

38:42.833 --> 38:45.633
but since you're here,

38:45.669 --> 38:48.670
I wanted to commend you for
the discretion you've shown

38:48.722 --> 38:51.473
throughout my courtship of Miss Shippen.

38:51.508 --> 38:53.007
Thank you, sir.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.810
I believe it is I who
should be thanking you.

38:55.846 --> 38:57.262
It is customary at this time of year

38:57.264 --> 38:59.597
for a gentleman to reward a diligent servant

38:59.599 --> 39:01.349
with a token of appreciation.

39:01.401 --> 39:04.269
A gift... coins, books, sweets.

39:04.271 --> 39:06.771
But those are trifles

39:06.773 --> 39:09.274
compared to the service
you have rendered me.

39:09.276 --> 39:12.694
Where did you say your boy Cicero was again?

39:12.746 --> 39:15.113
Oh, he's back in Setauket, sir.

39:15.165 --> 39:18.533
My former mistress takes care of him.

39:18.585 --> 39:20.335
That must be an unusual arrangement.

39:20.370 --> 39:22.837
Yes, sir, it is.

39:26.259 --> 39:29.761
Abigail, I would like to invite Cicero

39:29.796 --> 39:31.796
to take up residence here in Philadelphia

39:31.798 --> 39:35.100
under the same roof as his mother.

39:37.687 --> 39:39.721
Thank you, sir.

39:39.773 --> 39:41.856
You're too kind.

39:41.892 --> 39:44.476
Nonsense. You've earned it.

39:44.528 --> 39:46.144
I look forward to meeting Cicero.

39:46.196 --> 39:48.530
If he is half as industrious

39:48.565 --> 39:50.148
and loyal as his mother,

39:50.200 --> 39:53.118
he will make a fine
addition to this household.

40:12.672 --> 40:16.674
- <i>( Seagulls screeching )</i>
- ( men chattering )

40:21.181 --> 40:23.097
Morning, Mrs. Strong.

40:24.317 --> 40:26.151
And a lovely morning it is, too.

40:26.186 --> 40:29.320
I thought your company
was to deploy next week.

40:29.356 --> 40:31.189
Are you heading to Oyster Bay?

40:31.191 --> 40:33.408
Yes, but by way of Connecticut.

40:33.443 --> 40:35.443
Connecticut?

40:35.495 --> 40:36.911
I thought we might take a little detour

40:36.947 --> 40:39.614
to rescue my dear colleague Edmund Hewlett.

40:41.368 --> 40:43.585
What caused your change of heart?

40:43.620 --> 40:45.453
Why, you, of course.

40:45.505 --> 40:48.122
Your overture reminded me why I fight.

40:48.175 --> 40:51.876
Not for personal gain, but
because I have a duty to uphold

40:51.878 --> 40:54.879
to my fellow officers and to
the women who love them.

40:54.881 --> 40:57.599
My only satisfaction will
be in slaying our enemies

40:57.634 --> 40:59.300
and meriting your esteem.

40:59.352 --> 41:01.803
Killing two birds with
one stone, as it were.

41:03.557 --> 41:05.440
I... I don't know what to say.

41:05.475 --> 41:06.891
How can I thank you?

41:06.893 --> 41:10.728
Well, given the dangers we face

41:10.730 --> 41:14.566
and the possibility that I may not return,

41:14.568 --> 41:17.619
there's one favor I'll be
bold enough to request.

41:17.654 --> 41:20.071
A kiss.

41:21.408 --> 41:22.740
What?

41:22.792 --> 41:25.076
I know now that it's all I
will ever have from you,

41:25.078 --> 41:28.546
but I'll treasure the memory all the same

41:28.582 --> 41:30.665
for as long as I live.

41:54.691 --> 41:56.524
Madam.

42:04.701 --> 42:05.950
Did I see that right?

42:05.952 --> 42:07.585
Miss Strong just kiss you?

42:07.621 --> 42:09.287
Fear not, Akinbode.

42:09.339 --> 42:11.706
There'll be many of those soon to follow.

42:11.758 --> 42:14.842
Captain.

42:14.878 --> 42:17.345
We're going to save Hewlett?

42:17.380 --> 42:19.297
No.

42:19.349 --> 42:21.849
We're going to send him to his savior.
