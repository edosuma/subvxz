00:01.117 --> 00:03.287
<i>Previously on NClS:</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:05.247
Galib, has Abu infiltrated Sealift?

00:05.497 --> 00:10.127
They are about to. Our radio man,
Pinpin Pula is Abu Sayyaf.

00:10.377 --> 00:14.048
<i>He plans to blow the Cape Fear.
This will be as bad as 9/1 1 .</i>

00:15.633 --> 00:17.092
You didn't know him
when he was wounded

00:17.343 --> 00:18.928
- in Desert Storm?
- No.

00:19.178 --> 00:20.721
He seems to be repeating
that trauma,

00:20.930 --> 00:22.765
the coma that he doesn't wanna
wake up from.

00:23.015 --> 00:26.894
<i>lf Galib had intel on Abu's plans,
did he have time to tell Gibbs?</i>

00:27.144 --> 00:29.271
Maybe. They were together
when the bomb went off.

00:29.521 --> 00:32.274
<i>Let's hope Gibbs comes out
of this coma in time.</i>

00:32.524 --> 00:35.277
Jethro doesn't talk
much about the past.

00:35.486 --> 00:38.572
l know very little about his life
before we met.

01:02.346 --> 01:05.015
- Welcome back, Jethro.
- You were in an explosion.

01:05.182 --> 01:06.934
l remember.

01:07.685 --> 01:09.311
l don't know him.

02:00.939 --> 02:02.816
- You don't know Dr. Mallard?
- Ducky.

02:05.026 --> 02:06.486
Ducky. Do you know Ducky?

02:08.655 --> 02:10.824
l'm disappointed, Jethro.

02:11.074 --> 02:13.993
The last time someone forgot me,
l was a baby.

02:14.244 --> 02:17.497
My mother left me on the ferry
from Orkney to John o'Groat's.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.708
She was on the bus halfway
to Thurso before she missed me.

02:21.292 --> 02:25.171
l've often wondered if l inspired
the Liechtenstein T-shirt.

02:25.422 --> 02:28.258
- ''Oh, God. l left the baby on the bus.''
- Quite.

02:28.425 --> 02:31.094
Remember my telling you that,
Jethro?

02:34.472 --> 02:36.099
l remember the T-shirt.

02:36.683 --> 02:38.393
But not me.

02:40.186 --> 02:43.398
No worries. lt'll come.

02:43.606 --> 02:46.276
Absolutely. Temporary memory loss
is to be expected.

02:46.484 --> 02:49.779
Don't let it worry you.
You breathing comfortably?

02:52.240 --> 02:55.535
Good. Let's switch
to the nasal cannula, Maria.

02:55.744 --> 02:57.954
- Okay.
- You're doing fine.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.709
l'm just gonna to take this off.

03:03.501 --> 03:04.627
Most traumatized brain injuries

03:04.836 --> 03:07.589
produce short-term
retrograde amnesia.

03:07.756 --> 03:10.216
But to erase years of memory,

03:10.425 --> 03:12.761
his medial temporal lobes or
hippocampus should be damaged.

03:13.011 --> 03:15.388
No, his CAT scans
and EEG are normal.

03:15.597 --> 03:16.806
And he remembered the explosion.

03:17.015 --> 03:20.727
And l've never had a retrograde
amnesia patient remember the trauma.

03:20.977 --> 03:22.437
Never.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.231
Okay, there you go.

03:28.943 --> 03:31.071
l don't think
it's retrograde amnesia.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.447
l think it's dissociative.

03:32.655 --> 03:35.325
An emotional repression
of memory?

03:35.492 --> 03:38.078
With no physical damage to the brain,
it must be psychological.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.412
- No.
- But, doctor,

03:39.621 --> 03:41.581
you said Gibbs
hasn't spoken of his past.

03:41.790 --> 03:44.459
- Hardly ever.
- Perhaps it's too painful.

03:44.626 --> 03:47.629
lt could explain
the prolonged coma in '91 .

03:47.796 --> 03:50.090
But the present coma
is the result of an explosion.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.758
How could it be psychological?

03:52.550 --> 03:55.470
What if the latest coma
caused a relapse?

04:03.520 --> 04:04.771
So how are we doing?

04:07.816 --> 04:09.192
Confused.

04:09.359 --> 04:11.486
Let's see if we can clear up
some of those cobwebs.

04:12.821 --> 04:14.030
Do you remember the explosion?

04:14.781 --> 04:15.824
Yes.

04:16.074 --> 04:18.118
But where were you
when it happened?

04:19.994 --> 04:21.204
Kuwait.

04:25.417 --> 04:26.960
<i>l have good news.</i>

04:27.669 --> 04:28.962
Gibbs has regained consciousness.

04:29.838 --> 04:31.214
That's great.

04:31.423 --> 04:32.966
However, there's also a problem.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.219
He has some memory loss.

04:36.803 --> 04:40.014
Retrogressive amnesia
is totally normal after severe trauma.

04:40.223 --> 04:42.308
Happens every time the boss
smacks me on the head.

04:42.517 --> 04:44.477
You know,
l had amnesia after my car crash.

04:44.686 --> 04:46.729
Your bumper car
got T-boned at Legoland, probie?

04:46.938 --> 04:49.941
No, Tony. l told you about when l
totalled my Camaro when l was 1 6.

04:50.108 --> 04:51.568
That day is still a blank to me.

04:51.776 --> 04:54.696
Well, Gibbs' blank
is the last 1 5 years.

04:56.448 --> 04:58.324
To him, it's 1 991 .

04:58.533 --> 05:01.661
and he's a Marine gunny sergeant
wounded in Desert Storm.

05:02.454 --> 05:04.706
He doesn't know
he's an NClS special agent?

05:04.914 --> 05:06.374
l doubt it.

05:06.541 --> 05:08.168
He didn't recognise Ducky.

05:09.544 --> 05:12.005
Wait. lf he doesn't know
who Ducky is, then there's no--

05:12.213 --> 05:13.757
He'll never remember us.

05:13.923 --> 05:16.509
l am sure it's a temporary condition.
ln the meantime,

05:16.718 --> 05:20.096
we have an Abu Sayyaf terrorist
to apprehend.

05:22.474 --> 05:24.350
l really don't know anything more,
Abby.

05:24.559 --> 05:25.935
Can l go visit him?

05:26.853 --> 05:28.563
Not just yet.

05:28.730 --> 05:31.649
His neurologist, Captain Gelfand,
will let us know when he's up to it.

05:33.151 --> 05:35.403
Can l run to the restroom?
l'll come right back.

05:36.905 --> 05:39.824
lf anyone else needs a potty break,

05:39.991 --> 05:43.411
now's the time to do it.
We meet at 1 7 1 0.

05:46.122 --> 05:47.582
You know what that means?

05:47.749 --> 05:49.459
The director's taking over
the investigation.

05:49.667 --> 05:53.213
Probably. But l was thinking if Gibbs
doesn't remember the last 1 5 years,

05:54.255 --> 05:55.882
he'll be a probie.

05:56.091 --> 05:58.176
Gibbs would never let her take over.

05:58.384 --> 06:00.470
Not the old Gibbs.

06:00.678 --> 06:02.555
Probie Gibbs.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.726
- Director Shepard?
- Yes, DiNozzo.

06:06.935 --> 06:08.770
l want you to understand
that in Gibbs' absence,

06:08.978 --> 06:11.856
as the team's senior special agent,
this investigation is mine.

06:12.107 --> 06:13.775
- ls it?
- Yes, it is, ma'am.

06:13.983 --> 06:15.902
And if l were to dispute
that assumption?

06:16.111 --> 06:17.904
Then you would be a fool.

06:18.113 --> 06:20.365
And you are no fool, director.

06:20.573 --> 06:23.451
This will be a long,
tough investigation.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.288
You're overloaded as it is,
and no one knows this team

06:27.497 --> 06:29.999
better than me,
except for the boss.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.752
Which evidently isn't me.

06:32.961 --> 06:36.464
l was speaking, of course,
of the team boss, Gibbs.

06:36.714 --> 06:40.093
You are the agency boss.

06:40.718 --> 06:43.847
Not if you keep telling me
what l can and cannot do.

06:44.055 --> 06:48.476
- l would never do that, ma'am.
- Then what is it that you're saying?

06:49.185 --> 06:53.648
You take care of the big picture,
and let me handle the two-reeler.

06:55.567 --> 06:58.319
l always intended to, Tony.

06:58.486 --> 07:02.699
Then why did you make me say
all that just now?

07:02.907 --> 07:05.410
l just wanted to see
if you had as much guts as Gibbs.

07:12.876 --> 07:15.462
What's the first thing you remember
after the explosion?

07:28.725 --> 07:31.186
<i>Did you know when Jethro
was married he had a daughter?</i>

07:32.020 --> 07:34.147
No, that's not possible.

07:34.355 --> 07:38.026
l know all three of Jethro's ex-wives.
They had no children.

07:38.234 --> 07:40.820
With his first wife, Shannon, he did.

07:43.406 --> 07:45.033
They married in '82

07:45.200 --> 07:49.329
and had a daughter, Kelly,
who was born in '84.

07:52.707 --> 07:54.000
l can't believe it.

07:54.209 --> 07:56.377
There's more.

07:56.628 --> 08:00.673
They were murdered when Jethro
was fighting in Desert Storm.

08:00.882 --> 08:04.344
Shannon witnessed the shooting
of a Marine in Oceanside.

08:04.552 --> 08:08.515
She identified the killer
as Pedro Hernandez,

08:08.723 --> 08:11.184
a Mexican drug dealer
working Camp Pendleton.

08:11.392 --> 08:14.062
An NlS agent was assigned
to protect her.

08:14.270 --> 08:18.483
A sniper shot him in the head
while he was driving their van.

08:19.275 --> 08:21.069
He died instantly.

08:21.236 --> 08:25.365
Shannon and Jethro's
8-year-old daughter Kelly

08:26.741 --> 08:28.368
were killed in the crash.

08:31.037 --> 08:33.039
That is so awful.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.711
Kelly looked a lot like Jethro,
didn't she?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.797
Yes, a bit.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.424
She's a beautiful child.

08:43.633 --> 08:45.427
Very.

08:47.262 --> 08:48.430
So was Shannon.

08:49.931 --> 08:52.600
Jethro always did like redheads.

08:54.644 --> 08:56.438
Was Hernandez ever caught?

08:56.604 --> 08:59.357
No. He fled to Mexico.

08:59.524 --> 09:01.067
NlS tried to extradite,

09:01.317 --> 09:04.237
but the Mexican authorities
always claimed they couldn't find him.

09:04.946 --> 09:06.489
lt's in our cold case files.

09:07.115 --> 09:08.575
Well, you can close it.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.619
- What do you know?
- Jethro would have pursued

09:11.828 --> 09:14.956
the killer of his wife and daughter
to hell and back.

09:15.206 --> 09:18.293
Jethro got his revenge.

09:18.460 --> 09:22.172
After conducting the autopsy,
Ducky is virtually certain

09:22.380 --> 09:25.967
Abog Galib was inside the oil drum
when the explosive detonated.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.261
Why would he be
in a laundry oil drum?

09:28.470 --> 09:30.180
Maybe he was looking
for his laundry.

09:30.388 --> 09:33.475
- This is serious, Abby.
- Listen to the pot call the kettle black.

09:34.726 --> 09:36.603
- Got that right, didn't l?
- No.

09:36.811 --> 09:38.354
Yes.

09:38.563 --> 09:41.649
Probie,
why was Galib in that oil drum?

09:41.858 --> 09:43.068
He was hiding.

09:43.318 --> 09:47.280
- From who? Gibbs?
- Maybe. He ran from Gibbs,

09:47.489 --> 09:49.908
even though the plan was
to get arrested in front of the crew.

09:50.116 --> 09:52.660
Another question.
How did Pinpin Pula know

09:52.869 --> 09:55.038
Gibbs and Galib
would be in the ship's laundry?

09:55.246 --> 09:59.209
Right. Because they would have had
to put the bomb inside the oil drum

09:59.417 --> 10:01.461
- before they got there.
- Gibbs knows.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.505
Gibbs also thinks
the Giants won the Super Bowl

10:03.713 --> 10:06.299
<i>and Dances with Wolves
is an Academy Award nominee.</i>

10:06.508 --> 10:07.884
- l loved that movie.
- Me too.

10:08.134 --> 10:09.969
Those Native Americans
were so macho in their--

10:10.178 --> 10:11.554
Enough.

10:11.763 --> 10:14.516
Abby, l want a reenactment
of the explosion, okay?

10:14.682 --> 10:16.226
Using crime-scene photos,
measurements,

10:16.392 --> 10:17.852
- Ducky's--
- Ducky's autopsy findings?

10:18.061 --> 10:20.313
l know how to do
a computer reenactment, Tony.

10:21.189 --> 10:23.942
Ziva, what did you get out of the cook,
what's-his-name?

10:24.109 --> 10:28.238
Alon Atu. From the same
Filipino village in Basilan as Pinpin.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.240
He's hardcore Abu Sayyaf.

10:30.532 --> 10:32.575
- He won't talk unless l--
- No torture.

10:32.784 --> 10:34.160
He won't talk.

10:34.369 --> 10:37.205
- Try.
- Okay. But you're tying my feet.

10:38.039 --> 10:40.500
- Hands.
- Those too.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.669
McGee, Pinpin's photo
get added to the BOLO?

10:42.877 --> 10:44.754
- Yes, Tony.
- Sealift Command get it?

10:45.046 --> 10:46.673
They are faxing it to all 1 1 0 ships.

10:46.881 --> 10:48.425
No way he's gonna infiltrate Sealift.

10:48.591 --> 10:50.510
He blew up Galib
and put Gibbs in a coma.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.555
Rule Number 3:
never underestimate your opponent.

10:53.763 --> 10:58.726
<i>- No, actually Rule Number 3--
- DiNozzo's Rule Numero Tres, probie.</i>

10:58.935 --> 11:00.645
Gotcha.

11:00.854 --> 11:02.772
Never underestimate your opponent.

11:22.584 --> 11:23.877
Hey, Galib.

11:37.223 --> 11:38.349
<i>Today, technology stocks--</i>

11:38.558 --> 11:41.644
He's trying to catch up
on 1 5 years by watching TV.

11:41.853 --> 11:43.605
Jethro hates television.

11:43.813 --> 11:46.024
He can't believe
we're still fighting in lraq.

11:46.232 --> 11:47.358
<i>He's not alone.</i>

11:48.109 --> 11:50.862
Does he remember being
an NClS special agent?

11:51.362 --> 11:54.115
No.
Dr. Mallard's still a stranger to him.

11:53.924 --> 11:56.051
He won't know me then.

11:56.301 --> 11:58.220
Ducky worked with him
years before l did.

11:58.470 --> 12:00.305
<i>Well, who an amnesiac remembers</i>

12:01.056 --> 12:03.433
depends on their prior relationship.

12:05.977 --> 12:08.146
Have you found any Marines
he served with in Desert Storm?

12:08.355 --> 12:11.274
Two so far. One's dead.

12:11.483 --> 12:13.610
The other's a
regimental commander in lraq.

12:13.819 --> 12:16.279
Well, Gibbs recalls visiting his wife
and daughter's graves.

12:16.488 --> 12:18.740
So his memory is up to at least
June of '91 ,

12:18.949 --> 12:20.742
when he was released
from Bethesda.

12:20.951 --> 12:23.328
He joined NlS that August.

12:23.578 --> 12:25.247
<i>How about somebody he knew
at NlS?</i>

12:27.416 --> 12:31.461
Special Agent Michael Franks
headed the murder investigation.

12:31.670 --> 12:33.588
l'll start with him.

12:34.506 --> 12:37.175
- Thanks, Todd.
- When are you coming to see him?

12:37.426 --> 12:39.136
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

12:40.679 --> 12:42.389
l'll be here.

13:12.169 --> 13:15.339
Special Agent Franks retired in '96.

13:15.547 --> 13:18.675
He left no forwarding address
or phone number.

13:19.426 --> 13:22.179
- Yes, he did.
- He did?

13:22.471 --> 13:26.099
Find out where OPM
mails his retirement cheques.

13:57.422 --> 13:59.049
l just got paid.

13:59.257 --> 14:01.426
Then you can pay me
for the groceries.

14:01.635 --> 14:03.595
You owe me 320 pesos.

14:10.936 --> 14:13.188
Your hand is greasy.

14:14.481 --> 14:15.691
<i>- Who you calling?
- Operator.</i>

14:15.899 --> 14:17.442
<i>- l don't know.
- How may l help you?</i>

14:17.609 --> 14:19.236
Collect call
from Senor Miguel Franks.

14:19.486 --> 14:22.447
<i>- One moment.
- They called you at the cantina.</i>

14:22.656 --> 14:25.867
<i>- Who called me?
- Connecting.</i>

14:28.453 --> 14:29.454
Who the hell is this?

14:30.122 --> 14:32.457
Director Shepard's assistant,
Mr. Franks.

14:32.666 --> 14:35.127
<i>- Director of what?
- NClS, sir.</i>

14:37.129 --> 14:38.964
Why the hell didn't you ask me?

14:39.172 --> 14:41.591
<i>They said it was muy importante.</i>

14:41.800 --> 14:44.720
<i>What is the problema? lt's free.</i>

14:49.307 --> 14:52.310
- Speak.
- One moment. l'll connect you.

14:54.438 --> 14:55.439
Mr. Franks?

14:55.647 --> 14:58.567
How many damn assistants
does the director have?

14:59.609 --> 15:01.987
- Just one.
- Then who the hell are you?

15:02.195 --> 15:04.322
Director Shepard of NClS.

15:10.203 --> 15:11.663
Charlene, is this you?

15:11.830 --> 15:16.460
No. My name is Jenny Shepard
and l am director of NClS.

15:17.836 --> 15:20.172
<i>- Thank the Lord.
- That mean you approve?</i>

15:20.380 --> 15:24.843
Means all my thoughts
at early retirement was a mistake,

15:25.302 --> 15:27.179
just proved themselves wrong.

15:27.387 --> 15:30.974
l didn't call you to discuss
your opinions of a female director.

15:31.183 --> 15:32.476
Didn't think you did.

15:33.602 --> 15:34.811
l need your help,

15:35.854 --> 15:37.147
Special Agent Franks.

15:37.856 --> 15:40.025
Ain't been that for 1 1 years.

15:40.275 --> 15:43.820
- Goodbye, director.
- Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

15:47.866 --> 15:49.826
Can you imagine
how scary that would be

15:50.035 --> 15:51.662
to lose the last 1 5 years of your life?

15:51.870 --> 15:53.330
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:53.497 --> 15:54.873
You'd still be in high school.

15:56.375 --> 15:59.044
Zits. Braces. Raging hormones.

15:59.211 --> 16:02.047
l used to walk around all day
with my notebook in front of my--

16:03.382 --> 16:05.967
ln front of your what, McGee?

16:08.220 --> 16:09.888
The laundry room is off.

16:10.097 --> 16:14.226
lt should actually be
3.962 metres wide. Not 26.

16:16.353 --> 16:18.146
- Better?
- Yeah.

16:18.355 --> 16:19.815
Gotta be accurate.

16:20.315 --> 16:24.194
Absolutely. So was it
one of those tiny spiral notebooks

16:24.403 --> 16:28.448
or one of those big three-ring binder
kind of ones, Timmy?

16:28.657 --> 16:30.242
And where were you 1 5 years ago,
Abby?

16:30.450 --> 16:32.995
So where did you find Gibbs?

16:33.203 --> 16:34.496
Afraid l'm gonna find out--

16:34.746 --> 16:36.289
- What was that for?
- Distracting me.

16:36.456 --> 16:39.042
- l was not distracting you--
- Gibbs.

16:39.251 --> 16:41.211
Between the dryer
and the bulkhead.

16:42.254 --> 16:44.006
A little closer to the bulkhead.

16:45.424 --> 16:48.760
The autopsy report indicates
that Galib was sitting on the bomb.

16:48.969 --> 16:52.848
Which consisted of 1 1 3 grams
of Semtex.

16:53.056 --> 16:55.809
You can compute the amount
of Semtex used that accurately?

16:55.976 --> 16:57.269
l am a scientist, McGee.

16:57.477 --> 16:59.104
l can compute anything accurately,

16:59.271 --> 17:01.732
including the size of the
notebook required to--

17:01.940 --> 17:03.400
Stop.

17:03.608 --> 17:05.359
Can you detonate the bomb,
please?

17:09.948 --> 17:12.951
Sorry.
l forgot to tell you l added sound.

17:13.117 --> 17:16.538
Yeah. Can we try that again
without sound?

17:16.747 --> 17:18.123
Yeah, it was a little loud, huh?

17:18.790 --> 17:21.626
Yeah. And let's go frame-by-frame
so we can see what happened.

17:21.835 --> 17:23.462
Of course.

17:23.962 --> 17:25.172
ln the first microsecond,

17:25.380 --> 17:27.965
less than the time
it takes for you to blink your eye,

17:28.175 --> 17:31.261
the bottom of the barrel
and Galib's lower body are atomized.

17:31.470 --> 17:34.389
The oil drum is disintegrating,
but retains enough integrity

17:34.556 --> 17:37.392
to blow what remains of Galib
into the overhead.

17:37.601 --> 17:38.977
ln the following microseconds

17:40.312 --> 17:42.564
the oil drum disintegrates.

17:42.773 --> 17:44.399
Galib is impacted into the overhead

17:44.608 --> 17:48.070
and Gibbs is...

17:50.489 --> 17:52.074
- ...dead.
- Dead.

17:53.241 --> 17:55.327
lf Gibbs had been standing
when the bomb detonated,

17:55.535 --> 17:58.121
he'd have been blasted into the
bulkhead and shredded by shrapnel.

17:58.330 --> 18:00.332
Gibbs had to duck for cover
before the bomb went off.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.000
- He knew.
- Yeah.

18:02.209 --> 18:03.585
What's wrong with this picture?

18:03.794 --> 18:06.254
Nothing. McGee and l triple checked
all the numbers to make--

18:06.463 --> 18:08.965
Not your picture.
Did l make another idiomatic mistake?

18:09.174 --> 18:12.511
No. You mean something's wrong
with what we know.

18:12.719 --> 18:16.640
Exactly. We know Galib ran.
We know Gibbs pursued him.

18:16.848 --> 18:18.308
We know they were
in the ship's laundry.

18:18.475 --> 18:21.478
We know Galib sat on a bomb
inside the oil drum.

18:21.687 --> 18:23.146
And thanks to Abby and McGee,

18:23.313 --> 18:25.482
we know Gibbs knew
that a bomb was about to explode.

18:25.691 --> 18:27.442
Oh, and we know Pinpin,

18:27.651 --> 18:31.446
<i>a missing crewman on the Kamir
Bakir is an Abu Sayyaf terrorist.</i>

18:31.655 --> 18:33.657
Probably the one who planted
and detonated the bomb.

18:33.865 --> 18:35.742
You left out Pinpin Pula means
''rice paddy dike'',

18:35.951 --> 18:37.828
but other than that,
damn good summation.

18:38.036 --> 18:40.288
- Thank you.
- So as Ziva said,

18:40.497 --> 18:42.332
what is wrong with this picture?

18:42.541 --> 18:44.292
Gibbs knows.

18:44.501 --> 18:47.087
But he doesn't remember.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.968
Jethro?

18:59.808 --> 19:01.018
Shannon?

19:01.226 --> 19:05.147
No, Jethro. lt's me, Jenny.

19:12.529 --> 19:14.239
You still don't remember me?

19:26.877 --> 19:28.503
Maybe.

19:28.795 --> 19:30.255
l'm Jenny.

19:33.091 --> 19:34.926
We were partners.

19:36.595 --> 19:38.722
After Shannon died.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.390
Yes.

19:43.727 --> 19:45.103
Did l marry again?

19:45.687 --> 19:47.272
Three times.

19:49.399 --> 19:52.819
- No way.
- Afraid so.

19:56.114 --> 19:58.367
Oh, you're an ex-wife?

19:58.575 --> 20:00.869
Oh, God no.

20:02.996 --> 20:05.582
l'm the director of NClS.

20:08.627 --> 20:11.088
For a moment l thought
you were somebody else.

20:17.177 --> 20:20.847
You remembered us making love,
didn't you, Jethro?

20:35.487 --> 20:37.823
At least that's a start.

20:49.668 --> 20:51.503
Do you recognise this man?

21:06.852 --> 21:10.439
lt's like a name on the tip of my tongue
and l can't remember.

21:10.647 --> 21:13.233
- Calm down. lt'll come.
- lt's important, isn't it?

21:13.442 --> 21:15.610
- Yes. Very.
- lt's life or death, right?

21:15.819 --> 21:17.779
Don't get upset, Jethro.
You won't remember.

21:17.988 --> 21:18.989
Give me a name.

21:19.656 --> 21:21.992
Pinpin Pula.

21:24.244 --> 21:26.163
That's not his name.

21:26.538 --> 21:27.706
That can't be his name.

21:27.914 --> 21:29.875
- Are you sure?
- No. l'm not sure.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.461
l don't remember.
How can l be sure?

21:33.337 --> 21:35.130
- What's happening?
- l'm sorry. lt's my fault.

21:35.339 --> 21:36.340
1 0 milligrams of morphine.

21:36.548 --> 21:38.342
Agent Gibbs, your blood pressure
is spiking.

21:38.550 --> 21:40.844
l'm not Agent Gibbs.
l don't know Agent Gibbs.

21:41.053 --> 21:42.679
l don't wanna know Agent Gibbs.

21:43.722 --> 21:46.391
l want my family. l want Shannon.

21:47.059 --> 21:48.602
l want...

21:49.394 --> 21:51.063
...Kelly.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.359
l miss them.

21:55.567 --> 21:57.819
l miss them so much.

22:06.536 --> 22:08.872
Normally we'd move you
to a regular room, but for once

22:09.998 --> 22:12.751
the hospital is full up,
and lCU isn't.

22:14.503 --> 22:16.588
Having the sound off
isn't gonna help your memory.

22:16.797 --> 22:20.926
Nothing new. Same war.
Same crime. Same politics.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.055
Aren't you surprised The Terminator
is the governor of California?

22:25.263 --> 22:28.266
No. The Gipper was president.

22:29.226 --> 22:30.769
l'll be right back with your dinner.

22:30.936 --> 22:34.648
And none of that baby food, okay?
A steak. Rare would be nice.

22:34.856 --> 22:36.108
And French fries, please?

22:36.316 --> 22:38.402
Maybe tomorrow.

22:39.653 --> 22:43.031
Tomorrow l won't be here.

22:43.991 --> 22:45.826
Hello, probie.

22:49.579 --> 22:52.582
<i>My brother and l
married the same woman twice.</i>

22:52.791 --> 22:56.211
- Twice.
- She was a hell of a woman, probie.

22:59.631 --> 23:01.299
Hey, boss.

23:02.467 --> 23:04.928
Damn, you got old, Marine.

23:05.137 --> 23:07.681
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

23:09.433 --> 23:12.561
lf you hadn't been in a coma...

23:13.645 --> 23:15.564
They're dead, Mike.

23:16.023 --> 23:20.318
Shannon and Kelly,
they're both dead.

23:20.652 --> 23:21.945
l know, Jethro.

23:26.116 --> 23:28.535
lt can't have been 1 5 years.

23:30.537 --> 23:32.164
Can it?

23:35.459 --> 23:39.963
God, it feels like l just got the news
in Kuwait a couple of months ago.

23:45.385 --> 23:48.263
You investigated Shannon's murder.

23:48.472 --> 23:50.640
That's how l met you.

23:51.099 --> 23:53.101
Camp Pendleton.

23:54.144 --> 23:57.189
You were
the special agent in charge.

24:00.150 --> 24:01.777
Yeah.

24:02.694 --> 24:04.821
l became an agent because of you.

24:08.867 --> 24:11.953
You left the sniper folder
on your desk so l could--

24:14.998 --> 24:17.584
So l could join NlS.

24:19.294 --> 24:20.379
l liked the blue better, boss.

24:21.963 --> 24:24.966
NClS. The Navy changed the name
that same year.

24:25.133 --> 24:30.263
1 990? 90...?

24:30.472 --> 24:32.140
Two.

24:32.808 --> 24:34.768
We investigated crime scenes.

24:36.645 --> 24:39.022
l investigated crime scenes.

24:39.231 --> 24:40.524
You schlepped.

24:40.732 --> 24:42.734
ln Nam l packed twice
what you're carrying

24:42.984 --> 24:45.362
through monsoon mud
with Charlie shooting at my ass

24:45.570 --> 24:47.489
and still went faster than you.

24:51.076 --> 24:53.036
You taught me how to be an agent.

24:53.495 --> 24:56.248
No. l didn't teach.

24:56.415 --> 24:58.458
You observed.

24:59.584 --> 25:02.754
<i>Nineteen U.S. servicemen killed,
37 2 wounded.</i>

25:02.963 --> 25:04.423
<i>Khobar Towers.</i>

25:08.593 --> 25:10.637
<i>Semper fi.</i>

25:14.975 --> 25:16.435
Khobar Towers.

25:20.856 --> 25:22.649
You warned them about Bin Laden.

25:23.442 --> 25:25.277
They didn't listen.

25:25.777 --> 25:27.738
And you quit.

25:28.196 --> 25:29.573
l didn't quit.

25:31.074 --> 25:32.701
l retired.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.537
You were pissed
that they wouldn't listen, Mike.

25:36.413 --> 25:39.374
Pissed that all Clinton did was lob
a couple of cruise missiles

25:39.583 --> 25:42.336
at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.

25:42.836 --> 25:44.755
You quit, Mike.

25:47.007 --> 25:52.012
l didn't get calluses on my ass
flying from Mexico to argue, Jethro.

25:54.598 --> 25:56.224
Okay.

25:58.143 --> 26:00.187
You're right. l'm sorry.

26:00.645 --> 26:03.065
Never say you're sorry.

26:03.273 --> 26:07.110
- lt's a sign of weakness.
- Why are you here, Mike?

26:08.320 --> 26:10.197
Your director called me in.

26:10.405 --> 26:14.451
What's with the female
NClS director crap?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.620
l don't know.
l only remember Jenny as a--

26:16.828 --> 26:19.373
- Jenny?
- Yeah.

26:19.790 --> 26:21.917
Jenny.
She said she was my partner.

26:22.501 --> 26:23.960
What kind of partner?

26:24.878 --> 26:26.713
You can't smoke in here.

26:28.382 --> 26:30.634
l forgot l was in a hospital.

26:30.842 --> 26:33.136
lt's against the law to smoke
in any public building.

26:33.345 --> 26:34.971
You're kidding.

26:35.597 --> 26:38.266
Another good reason
to live in Mexico.

26:42.896 --> 26:44.272
You were right, Dr. Mallard.

26:44.481 --> 26:45.857
For once?

26:46.024 --> 26:48.860
- No, doctor. You--
- What am l right about this time?

26:49.069 --> 26:50.362
Galib and the oil drum.

26:50.570 --> 26:52.030
Abby's computer re-creation looks

26:52.239 --> 26:54.366
exactly like he's been shot
from a cannon.

26:54.574 --> 26:59.329
Well, it's a risky occupation
even without explosives.

26:59.538 --> 27:02.082
They don't use explosives
to shoot people out of cannons?

27:02.290 --> 27:04.001
A man of your age and education?

27:04.209 --> 27:05.669
Really, Mr. Palmer.

27:05.877 --> 27:08.380
l know that they don't use
high explosives.

27:08.588 --> 27:10.757
l thought maybe black powder.

27:10.966 --> 27:14.177
Compressed air
or spring-driven catapults

27:14.386 --> 27:17.472
shoot our intrepid
cannonballer into the air.

27:17.681 --> 27:21.018
David ''Cannonball'' Smith
set the record.

27:21.226 --> 27:26.023
Yes, he even was fired across
the Mexican-United States border.

27:26.231 --> 27:28.400
He carried a passport,

27:28.608 --> 27:31.361
although today one wonders why.

27:31.570 --> 27:36.158
lt's a sad fact that 60 percent
of all human cannonballs

27:36.366 --> 27:37.826
are eventually killed.

27:38.035 --> 27:41.163
Well, if they don't use explosives,
then why do so many of them die?

27:42.748 --> 27:45.167
They miss the net, Mr. Palmer.

27:47.044 --> 27:49.629
They miss the-- Oh, my.

27:49.838 --> 27:51.381
What is it, doctor?

27:51.590 --> 27:54.176
Galib wasn't sitting in the oil drum.

27:54.968 --> 27:56.887
He was stuffed in it.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.139
Look.

28:03.393 --> 28:04.853
The neck bone's cut.

28:05.020 --> 28:08.482
Cervical vertebrae was cut
very deeply.

28:08.690 --> 28:11.193
You were slashed from ear to ear,
weren't you?

28:11.401 --> 28:12.861
A machete or a bolo knife.

28:13.070 --> 28:16.573
Yes, l believe
the Filipinos call it a parang.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.076
Whatever they're called,
it answers one of our questions.

28:19.284 --> 28:20.827
And poses a new one.

28:21.036 --> 28:22.621
lf Galib was dead--

28:22.829 --> 28:25.707
Who did Gibbs follow
into the laundry?

28:26.208 --> 28:28.085
- Clear.
- Clear.

28:29.127 --> 28:30.587
Got a pulse.
Give him a mil of atropine.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.632
- Got him at 82 over 58.
- Getting better, ladies.

28:33.799 --> 28:37.552
Blood pressure is coming up.
Death is not my jam.

28:43.266 --> 28:45.394
You haven't touched your dinner,
Special Agent Gibbs.

28:46.770 --> 28:50.232
No steak tomorrow
if you don't eat your Jell-O today.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.611
You got your knife, Mike?

28:55.362 --> 28:56.822
Security took it at the airport.

28:57.364 --> 28:59.199
Was it more than three inches long?

28:59.408 --> 29:01.785
They changed that rule after 9/1 1 .

29:01.994 --> 29:03.704
9/1 1 ?

29:03.912 --> 29:07.040
September 1 1th, 2001 .

29:07.249 --> 29:12.129
Hey, boss. lt's '96
and you just retired.

29:13.588 --> 29:15.257
Damn, this is good.

29:15.674 --> 29:17.134
l owe you.

29:17.634 --> 29:19.720
Had to be a hijacking, huh?

29:21.680 --> 29:24.975
They never change security
until it's too late.

29:34.985 --> 29:37.988
Al Qaeda hijacked four airliners.

29:40.324 --> 29:42.451
Two hit the World Trade Centre.

29:42.659 --> 29:45.078
One the Pentagon.

29:45.579 --> 29:48.582
Fourth was to take out
the White House.

29:50.542 --> 29:53.795
Some gutsy passengers
fought them.

29:54.004 --> 29:55.839
They went down in Pennsylvania.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.679
Twin Towers are gone.

30:03.388 --> 30:05.432
Pentagon's fixed.

30:06.308 --> 30:08.435
Three thousand some dead.

30:10.270 --> 30:12.731
Nearly as many wounded.

30:19.446 --> 30:20.989
Sir?

30:23.367 --> 30:25.702
- Are you all right?
- He's okay.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.121
Got some bad news.

30:40.801 --> 30:42.803
That nurse is right.

30:43.011 --> 30:45.681
l'm not ready for a steak yet.

30:48.225 --> 30:52.270
Well, tell me we did more than
toss a couple of cruise missiles.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.065
We did more.

30:55.273 --> 30:56.566
Bin Laden?

30:56.775 --> 30:59.444
- l don't know.
- How the hell can you not know?

31:03.490 --> 31:07.160
Remember that beach
in Baja we fished?

31:08.787 --> 31:12.082
Yeah. South of El Rosario.

31:12.541 --> 31:14.876
l built a little place there.

31:15.085 --> 31:18.880
No TV, no radio, no newspapers.

31:19.089 --> 31:22.259
l fish. l drink beer.

31:22.467 --> 31:24.928
Listen to old eight-track tapes.

31:25.137 --> 31:29.266
Drive to a cantina up the coast
when l want company

31:29.474 --> 31:30.934
when the pickup's running.

31:31.101 --> 31:33.437
This is the first time

31:33.645 --> 31:37.441
<i>l've been to El Norte in 1 0 years.</i>

31:37.649 --> 31:41.361
Don't ask me for a sit-rep, Jethro.
l don't know.

31:42.029 --> 31:43.280
You don't wanna know.

31:44.323 --> 31:46.450
That's right. l don't wanna know.

31:46.658 --> 31:48.452
You feel guilty because you quit.

31:49.244 --> 31:53.290
lf you hadn't quit
maybe you're the one that stops it.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.461
You didn't quit.

32:28.784 --> 32:30.661
Hey, Galib. What are you up to?

32:30.911 --> 32:32.704
Stretching my legs.
lt's too windy on deck.

32:32.913 --> 32:35.123
Hey, why don't you join
the poker game tonight?

32:35.332 --> 32:36.792
You never leave
that damn radio room.

32:36.958 --> 32:39.127
l talk to ham radio operators
at night.

32:39.336 --> 32:41.421
And you'd rather do that
than play poker?

32:42.464 --> 32:44.508
- They're all girls.
- Right.

32:56.812 --> 32:59.481
You insist this is Pinpin Pula.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.067
lnsist. Yes.

33:02.275 --> 33:05.570
l like this word.
l insist this is Pinpin.

33:05.779 --> 33:07.614
l don't believe you.

33:07.823 --> 33:09.741
Why would l lie to you
when you threaten to kill me?

33:09.950 --> 33:13.620
<i>lt is not a threat.
l will kill you if you lie, capitan.</i>

33:13.829 --> 33:15.080
l believe you.

33:15.288 --> 33:17.082
l'm the one who has doubts.

33:18.458 --> 33:20.711
lt is Pinpin. l swear.

33:24.339 --> 33:26.299
That's not loaded, is it?

33:26.508 --> 33:29.761
Would Gibbs allow Ziva
to carry a loaded weapon in there?

33:29.970 --> 33:33.390
- No.
- And l'm not Gibbs, right?

33:34.141 --> 33:35.600
<i>So, capitan.</i>

33:39.813 --> 33:41.440
You're positive?

33:41.648 --> 33:45.402
l am positive. Absolutely positive.
How many times do l have to tell you?

33:47.029 --> 33:48.113
Once more.

33:50.449 --> 33:52.451
- Take a good look.
- l don't need to look.

33:52.659 --> 33:54.703
The man was on my ship
for months.

33:54.911 --> 33:56.455
lt's Pinpin Pula.

33:56.663 --> 33:58.457
Was he Abu Sayyaf?

33:58.665 --> 34:00.292
Yes. He was Abu Sayyaf.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.421
- Who ran from customs?
- Yes. Yes. He ran when your guy--

34:06.757 --> 34:09.801
You knew it was Pinpin,
not Galib, at the custom's gate.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.973
Yes, l knew. l knew.
They paid me. l was quiet.

34:15.181 --> 34:16.641
They paid me to be quiet.

34:16.850 --> 34:18.810
But Pinpin never told me
there was a bomb.

34:19.018 --> 34:20.978
l never knew that. l never knew--

34:24.315 --> 34:27.152
That's the NClS lD photo
of Special Agent Abog Galib

34:27.319 --> 34:29.237
that l showed Gibbs.
What's your point, DiNozzo?

34:29.446 --> 34:30.697
A scary one, director.

34:32.074 --> 34:35.327
Captain Mahir admitted to Ziva
that Pinpin passed himself off

34:35.534 --> 34:37.079
as Galib at the custom's check.

34:37.245 --> 34:38.871
And Gibbs would have
expected Galib

34:39.081 --> 34:40.748
to change his appearance
going undercover.

34:40.956 --> 34:44.085
Growing his hair, maybe a moustache,
dirty himself up.

34:44.293 --> 34:47.589
So when Pinpin handed him Galib's
passport it was good enough.

34:47.797 --> 34:49.591
- To pass the mustard.
- Muster, not mustard.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.679
Galib's documents are vetted
to get him on any crew in the world.

34:53.887 --> 34:55.347
<i>lncluding the Cape Fear
or Cape Horn.</i>

34:55.554 --> 34:57.391
We sent a second BOLO
with Pinpin's photo.

34:57.599 --> 34:59.559
Both ships confirmed,
he was not onboard.

34:59.768 --> 35:03.063
Send it again a.k.a. Abog Galib.
Get me the crew rosters

35:03.271 --> 35:04.564
- from Sealift Command.
- On it.

35:04.773 --> 35:08.193
DiNozzo, call MTAC.
l want the NSO, Pentagon, FBl, ClA,

35:08.402 --> 35:11.071
hell, everyone on ASAP.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.448
My gut tells me
we're missing something.

35:14.616 --> 35:15.867
Gibbs.

35:16.576 --> 35:19.246
Yeah, Gibbs.

35:42.019 --> 35:45.147
- Yeah?
- Ziva.

35:48.108 --> 35:50.652
- Do we work together?
- Yes.

35:50.861 --> 35:53.613
l'm a Mossad officer
attached to your team.

35:53.822 --> 35:56.074
Mossad?
When did they start doing that?

35:56.283 --> 35:57.909
lt's been a year.

36:00.662 --> 36:02.456
Don't feel bad.
l worked with that M.E.--

36:02.664 --> 36:03.790
Ducky. 1 0 years.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.125
And you don't remember him.

36:05.334 --> 36:06.793
Do you always finish
people's sentences?

36:06.960 --> 36:08.587
Only when l'm in a hurry.

36:09.421 --> 36:13.967
Abu Sayyaf is planning
a terrorist attack on the Navy.

36:14.176 --> 36:16.762
- lt will be as devastating as--
- 9/1 1 .

36:17.471 --> 36:19.181
You remember 9/1 1 ?

36:19.389 --> 36:20.849
My boss told me.

36:21.016 --> 36:23.018
- Director Shepard.
- No. No, my boss.

36:23.226 --> 36:26.605
lt doesn't matter. What can l do?

36:26.813 --> 36:28.357
Remember.

36:28.523 --> 36:31.193
l've been trying to since l woke up
in this room.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.361
Well, try harder.

36:34.363 --> 36:35.822
Good. That's a start.

36:36.865 --> 36:38.825
- What is?
- The old Gibbs stare.

36:39.034 --> 36:42.496
You gave it to all of us.
McGee, Tony, me.

36:43.246 --> 36:44.790
What are you talking about?

36:55.175 --> 36:56.885
Ari.

36:57.719 --> 36:59.680
Ari killed Kate.

37:03.892 --> 37:05.143
And l--

37:07.688 --> 37:10.023
l killed Ari.

37:19.032 --> 37:20.826
Your brother.

37:21.368 --> 37:22.911
Yes.

37:23.537 --> 37:25.247
You killed your brother...

37:28.166 --> 37:29.543
...to save me.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.061
- l'm sure he remembers you, Ducky.
- Ziva's driving him here now.

37:48.270 --> 37:50.063
l don't know.
Maybe she pulled her signal in.

37:50.272 --> 37:51.982
- Ziva's bringing him.
- He's coming back.

37:52.149 --> 37:54.234
- He will remember you, absolutely.
- He insisted.

37:54.443 --> 37:56.278
Any minute now.

37:57.154 --> 37:58.780
- Boss.
- McGee.

38:00.449 --> 38:02.701
- Boss, no, l'm McGee.
- Gibbs.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.995
Hey, Abby.

38:05.203 --> 38:06.747
l do remember you, Abs.

38:07.497 --> 38:09.833
Ducky, how can l forget
your mother left you on a bus?

38:10.042 --> 38:11.877
l have no idea, Jethro.

38:12.085 --> 38:13.920
- Should you be out, Gibbs?
- l don't have time.

38:14.129 --> 38:16.006
l'll talk to you both later.

38:18.925 --> 38:20.635
l should have known it wasn't Galib.

38:20.802 --> 38:22.179
Oh, no.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.930
l'd have made the same mistake.

38:24.139 --> 38:25.682
Well, yeah, DiNozzo. l know.

38:25.849 --> 38:27.142
That's why l'm so pissed.

38:28.268 --> 38:30.312
You didn't forget me.

38:31.480 --> 38:35.192
<i>The Cape Fear is loaded
with 20,000 tons of munitions,</i>

38:35.400 --> 38:36.443
Deputy Director Welch.

38:36.652 --> 38:38.779
<i>Which is why we cannot permit her
to reach Gibraltar</i>

38:38.987 --> 38:40.530
<i>without boarding
a Navy search team.</i>

38:40.697 --> 38:44.618
Agreed. But if that frigate signals a
heave-to and prepare to be boarded,

38:44.826 --> 38:48.121
<i>Pinpin Pula will blow the Cape Fear.
No one will survive.</i>

38:48.330 --> 38:50.749
<i>lf he's on board
and if he's a suicide bomber.</i>

38:50.957 --> 38:54.461
<i>You're risking 19 civilian lives
on ifs, Director Welsh.</i>

38:54.670 --> 38:57.005
<i>ln the Med he could explode
near a cruise ship.</i>

38:57.214 --> 38:59.466
<i>Nineteen will seem
an acceptable loss--</i>

38:59.675 --> 39:01.760
No death is acceptable
when it's unnecessary.

39:01.968 --> 39:03.970
Deputy Director Welsh,
Special Agent Gibbs.

39:05.180 --> 39:07.933
This terrorist isn't after
a cruise liner.

39:08.141 --> 39:09.976
<i>lslamic terrorists love soft targets.</i>

39:10.185 --> 39:11.978
No, he wants
the Marine assault ship

39:12.187 --> 39:13.730
<i>the Cape Fear's replenishing
in the Gulf.</i>

39:13.897 --> 39:16.108
<i>You don't know what he wants.
He's a terrorist.</i>

39:16.316 --> 39:19.486
<i>- A cruise ship, the Suez Canal--
- He told me.</i>

39:19.695 --> 39:21.321
<i>He told you?</i>

39:21.530 --> 39:23.365
Pinpin Pula is an arrogant
son-of-a-bitch.

39:23.573 --> 39:25.617
He thought the bomb
he'd planted would kill me.

39:25.826 --> 39:27.744
<i>So he's not a suicide bomber?</i>

39:27.953 --> 39:30.622
For God's sakes,
order that frigate to break off.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.793
<i>l can't do that.</i>

39:35.002 --> 39:37.170
ls everyone up there
as stupid as you?

39:37.796 --> 39:40.382
<i>Pinpin Pula is on the Cape Fear.</i>

39:40.590 --> 39:41.883
He's the radio man.

39:42.092 --> 39:43.802
He intercepts every BOLO
we send him

39:44.011 --> 39:45.887
and he replies ''No Pinpin here.''

39:46.096 --> 39:48.181
<i>We got that, Special Agent Gibbs.</i>

39:48.390 --> 39:52.060
<i>lt's why we didn't communicate
with Cape Fear until...</i>

39:52.561 --> 39:53.854
<i>...now.</i>

39:54.062 --> 39:55.605
Jeff. Thank God you're there.

39:55.814 --> 39:58.316
Can you get your SEALs
onboard without being seen?

39:58.525 --> 40:00.527
<i>We can execute a HALO insertion
within 1 0 hours.</i>

40:00.736 --> 40:03.405
<i>The Cape Fear will have entered
the Med. That's unacceptable.</i>

40:03.613 --> 40:06.491
<i>lf anything happens,
it'll be on some tourist video camera.</i>

40:06.700 --> 40:09.202
The sailors on that frigate
have video cameras.

40:09.411 --> 40:11.371
<i>We can confiscate those videos.</i>

40:11.580 --> 40:15.542
What?
You don't want this being seen?

40:15.751 --> 40:19.421
<i>An accident at sea
is better than an act of terrorism.</i>

40:21.590 --> 40:23.050
lt's too late.

40:23.216 --> 40:24.593
<i>Cape Fear, heave-to.</i>

40:24.760 --> 40:26.678
<i>Stand by to be boarded
for inspection.</i>

40:26.887 --> 40:30.057
<i>Heave-to. Stand by
to be boarded for inspection.</i>

40:31.266 --> 40:32.851
You bastard.

40:59.795 --> 41:01.505
l was wrong.

41:05.258 --> 41:06.551
You weren't wrong.

41:08.428 --> 41:10.430
l was angry at Mike.

41:11.264 --> 41:14.101
l never understood
how he could quit...

41:20.315 --> 41:21.942
...until now.

41:31.618 --> 41:35.122
Oh, l got them, boss.

41:35.330 --> 41:38.667
l got them from the medics
when they took you.

41:39.876 --> 41:41.503
Appreciate it.

41:47.009 --> 41:48.635
You'll do.

41:55.851 --> 41:57.811
lt's your team now.

42:04.818 --> 42:08.030
Tim, you're a good agent.

42:08.238 --> 42:10.282
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

42:11.533 --> 42:13.327
l won't, boss.

42:14.703 --> 42:16.455
Gibbs.

42:33.305 --> 42:36.058
l owe you, Ziva.

42:36.475 --> 42:39.394
l'll collect, Jethro.

42:42.439 --> 42:45.525
- Give me a ride home, Duck.
- Of course.

42:57.663 --> 42:59.539
<i>Semper fi.</i>
