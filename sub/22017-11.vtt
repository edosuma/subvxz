WEBVTT

00:02.193 --> 00:03.808
- You kissed me.
- No. Why would I do that

00:03.827 --> 00:06.309
- when my boyfriend is out there?
- Ask yourself that question!

00:07.614 --> 00:09.739
Stop, stop, stop, stop. No, we can't.
Not here.

00:09.751 --> 00:10.771
You can find somewhere
else to stay tonight.

00:10.775 --> 00:13.240
I'm gonna continue to
take people away from you

00:13.251 --> 00:14.806
until you give me what I want.

00:14.817 --> 00:17.757
You not living without me, Cotton,
so that means you got to go,

00:17.787 --> 00:19.699
- and that's what it's gonna be.
- How long has this been happening?

00:19.721 --> 00:23.126
- Since the showcase.
- I'm-a get you a new therapist.

00:23.251 --> 00:24.400
Grandma.

00:24.474 --> 00:27.613
- And how you gonna pay that?
- If you can find a way to move that foot,

00:27.624 --> 00:29.518
I'm-a find a way to
pay for that therapy.

00:29.536 --> 00:31.214
<i>Yeah, I'm trying to get
ahold of Charles Floyd.</i>

00:31.238 --> 00:33.011
<i>Tell him I got something
he's gonna want to see.</i>

00:33.035 --> 00:35.297
- You sold me out.
- What?

00:35.312 --> 00:37.216
You don't have a label anymore,

00:37.231 --> 00:39.538
and I don't have a daughter.

01:36.318 --> 01:38.541
No. You haven't noticed
that about me?

01:39.581 --> 01:41.596

need to take a walk.

01:41.958 --> 01:43.956

wants me in there?

03:50.783 --> 03:51.860
Miss Carlotta.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.917
How much longer we got
stay here with Miss Ruby?

03:53.929 --> 03:56.031
Well, insurance money
is on the way.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.843
- Contractors say about a month.
- A month?

03:59.035 --> 04:00.776
I don't got a month
left in me with her.

04:00.801 --> 04:03.269
Girl, calm down. You got
a song on the radio.

04:03.718 --> 04:05.222
Charles Floyd called us in,

04:05.248 --> 04:07.843
and I'm-a use that to hit
him up for some money.

04:07.886 --> 04:09.451
We can get this album done.

04:09.468 --> 04:12.307
You think that one hot song on
the radio is gonna convince him?

04:12.328 --> 04:14.149
No. But it's worth a try.

04:14.185 --> 04:16.620
And I, uh, also want
to let you all know

04:16.692 --> 04:19.194
that I'm gonna chill with
this whole Noah thing.

04:19.319 --> 04:20.586
Good idea.

04:20.923 --> 04:22.124
- Thanks.
- Okay.

04:22.159 --> 04:25.108
We just gonna make a quick stop
before we hit the label and...

04:29.242 --> 04:30.710
Y'all wait right here.

04:31.452 --> 04:32.801
Is it Batista?

04:34.218 --> 04:35.620
What is he doing here?

04:35.688 --> 04:37.112
What do you think?

04:37.556 --> 04:40.182
I don't want Mama's thug
sittin' in front of my house.

04:40.242 --> 04:42.922
Carlotta, this is your own cousin.
Will you stop?

04:42.940 --> 04:44.379
Tell your mother I
can go back home.

04:44.403 --> 04:46.446
I ain't want to come up here
to see your ass anyway.

04:46.571 --> 04:48.507
Brick, shut up and wait.

04:49.148 --> 04:52.222
Listen, Brick is insurance
for Cotton's safety.

04:52.239 --> 04:53.679
The cops got it handled.

04:54.039 --> 04:56.164
You is a fool if
you believe that.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.831
You know what, you need to learn

04:57.848 --> 04:59.644
how to accept a little
help from family.

04:59.769 --> 05:03.073
Your help comes with
strings, and prison bids.

05:04.463 --> 05:06.023
Get his ass out of here.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.774
Can I meet the group?

05:11.975 --> 05:14.069
- What... Oh...
- We need to talk.

05:14.278 --> 05:15.335
God.

05:15.754 --> 05:17.952
You can't just barge in here.

05:18.349 --> 05:19.795
I should call security.

05:19.817 --> 05:21.509
Simone needs her things back,

05:21.556 --> 05:23.214
but your staff won't
let us in your house

05:23.215 --> 05:25.955
because you holed up over here
since your daddy fired you.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.320
Okay. Let me get your address,

05:29.373 --> 05:33.007
and I will have everything
boxed up and sent to you.

05:33.072 --> 05:34.841
The case worker called me today.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.434
And as you can see, I
am in no condition

05:37.439 --> 05:39.418
to pursue this
guardianship thing.

05:39.431 --> 05:42.552
Okay. Uh, how... how long
do you think I have?

05:42.565 --> 05:45.366
I think I can try to hold
them off another week.

05:45.383 --> 05:47.067
- So much for helping her.
- Look at her.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.563
She can barely
help herself walk.

05:48.579 --> 05:50.334
I really should've
called the police on her

05:50.347 --> 05:51.758
when she pulled that gun on me.

05:51.779 --> 05:53.794
What you should've done was
pull the trigger on yourself

05:53.818 --> 05:55.601
- like I told you to...
- Stop. Hey, Star, stop!

05:55.620 --> 05:57.161
- You still got time.
- Stop!

05:57.286 --> 05:59.239
Obviously, she's a mess.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.593
Hey, Ayanna, are
you feeling okay?

06:05.100 --> 06:07.618
You can't keep hiding
in here like this.

06:09.123 --> 06:11.099
You're a sweet girl, Simone.

06:12.997 --> 06:17.352
If there's anything that I can
do to make things right...

06:18.242 --> 06:19.575
I will.

06:19.610 --> 06:22.129
She don't need nothing
from you but her things.

06:22.513 --> 06:23.879
Come on, Simone.

06:33.385 --> 06:35.253
Congrats. You won the showcase.

06:35.288 --> 06:36.992
The next Midtown
tour is all you.

06:37.237 --> 06:38.639
Okay. Um,

06:39.302 --> 06:41.683
I figured I'd lock in
with one or two producers

06:41.756 --> 06:44.364
before we put an album together,
before we hit the road.

06:44.651 --> 06:45.762
Um...

06:46.083 --> 06:48.212
What're you talking about?
Like, next summer?

06:48.884 --> 06:50.204
Try next month.

06:50.241 --> 06:52.684
The label needs to pull
in some revenue quickly,

06:52.714 --> 06:55.712
and we have a sponsor that's
given us an excellent deal.

06:55.985 --> 06:58.007
It's the one thing my
daughter did right.

06:58.033 --> 07:00.625
And if we're lucky, we'll
hook in an A-list promoter.

07:00.659 --> 07:02.720
I... I won't even be
ready in a month...

07:02.845 --> 07:04.328
I... I don't have an album.

07:04.349 --> 07:07.393
Then pull your ass out of the
clubs and into the studio.

07:07.445 --> 07:09.617
Oh, sorry, we had
an appointment.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.926
Perfect timing.

07:10.961 --> 07:13.529
We're sending Noah on
tour for six months,

07:13.588 --> 07:15.764
and we'd like Alex to join him.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.531
- Wait, what?
- No, I'm not going on tour with him.

07:18.656 --> 07:19.874
I have a group.

07:19.921 --> 07:21.636
We have a song on the
radio right now...

07:21.657 --> 07:22.850
we're doing better than ever.

07:22.871 --> 07:24.351
I mean, unless we're
going to join her.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.423
- That's not part of the plan.
- Hold on a minute.

07:26.436 --> 07:28.343
Let's... let's all
take a step back.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.846
Noah and Alex have a hit.

07:31.190 --> 07:33.849
They are the couple that
everybody wants to be.

07:33.884 --> 07:35.406
Okay, yeah, that's nice and all.

07:35.419 --> 07:36.466
But it's not real.

07:36.591 --> 07:38.775
Okay? Everything
between us was fake.

07:38.814 --> 07:40.701
You sold the hell out of fake,

07:40.725 --> 07:42.952
and the fans all love you two.

07:43.538 --> 07:46.040
Which makes Alex a crucial
part of this tour.

07:46.061 --> 07:48.998
You can't just take our producer
on the road, Mr. Floyd.

07:49.024 --> 07:51.611
I mean, the girls need
Alex to make their album.

07:51.636 --> 07:54.303
And they can. In six months,
after the tour is over.

07:54.338 --> 07:55.851
You can't make me go.

07:56.813 --> 07:59.387
But my legal team can.

08:00.144 --> 08:02.482
I own your music.
I own your voice.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.548
I own your time.

08:05.116 --> 08:07.379
Enjoy the tour, Ms. Crane.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.694
You supposed to have our backs.
My back.

08:12.706 --> 08:14.455
Baby, I do. It's not over.

08:14.468 --> 08:15.934
Now, Noah needs an opening act.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.713
As soon as we lock down some
things, I'll have Charles' ear.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.709
Then I could pitch Take Three.
Think about it.

08:20.726 --> 08:22.453
With Alex already
going, it's a win-win.

08:22.496 --> 08:23.950
But he ain't even
thinking about that.

08:23.972 --> 08:25.306
He ain't heard my pitch.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.329
Don't be so sure of
yourself, Maurice.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.771
Jahil is up in the mix.
I can smell it.

08:29.839 --> 08:31.164
Well, so am I.

08:31.391 --> 08:34.392
Well, can you make it happen soon?
I'm serious.

08:34.517 --> 08:36.881
I got family drama, and
the last thing I need

08:36.902 --> 08:38.570
is my girls falling apart.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.904
Baby, I got you. Trust me.

08:42.033 --> 08:44.260
I haven't trusted too
many men in my life.

08:44.312 --> 08:46.122
Well, you gonna
have to trust me.

08:51.350 --> 08:52.448
Mr. Floyd.

08:53.017 --> 08:54.562
I wanted to talk to
you about the tour.

08:54.586 --> 08:56.565
You're doing a stellar job, Mr.
Jetter.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.354
You remind me of me.

08:59.426 --> 09:01.938
Business-minded, focused.

09:02.256 --> 09:04.201
The kind of exec I can
see a future with.

09:04.231 --> 09:06.291
- Well, that's the goal, sir...
- If you play smart.

09:06.518 --> 09:08.729
I wanted to talk to
you about Take Three.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.832
Taking them on the
road with Noah

09:10.841 --> 09:12.248
could really build
their fan base.

09:12.299 --> 09:14.655
It's true. They're,
uh, they're talented.

09:14.780 --> 09:15.780
But answer me this.

09:15.781 --> 09:18.590
What do the top ten grossing tours
of all time have in common?

09:18.657 --> 09:21.402
I don't think he needs a
lesson in music history.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.236
Well, maybe you need
a lesson in finance.

09:23.249 --> 09:25.729
It's men... men is the common
factor, see, 'cause men,

09:25.742 --> 09:27.708
they sell out the stadiums
because it's the ladies

09:27.729 --> 09:29.427
and the girls that are
buying the tickets.

09:29.467 --> 09:31.279
Why have one Noah when
you can have three?

09:31.283 --> 09:32.570
What have you got in mind?

09:32.591 --> 09:34.558
I'm thinking "The
Men of Midtown."

09:34.584 --> 09:36.470
Noah Brooks, with Andy

09:36.499 --> 09:38.650
- and Angel.
- You got to be kidding.

09:39.744 --> 09:41.412
Jetter, what are your thoughts?

09:41.459 --> 09:43.139
Well, they're both
compelling groups.

09:43.182 --> 09:44.687
Both have singles on the radio.

09:45.290 --> 09:46.590
You should hear the new song

09:46.598 --> 09:48.532
my girls are working on
before you make a decision.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.836
Look, my boys got a new
joint that's poppin' too.

09:50.853 --> 09:52.311
And we got more views,
more followers,

09:52.332 --> 09:54.443
- more talent.
- Right, right, right. All right.

09:54.888 --> 09:56.607
I should listen to everything.

09:57.189 --> 09:58.929
Why don't we just
have a sing-off?

09:59.690 --> 10:02.667
- Like the old days.
- Hm. I like that.

10:03.506 --> 10:05.334
- We ain't scared.
- Hmm.

10:05.370 --> 10:07.194
This is gonna be fun.

10:11.217 --> 10:13.264
Let's give this
another try, okay?

10:13.932 --> 10:16.888
This time, I'm applying
a stronger current.

10:17.930 --> 10:19.148
Derek.

10:20.618 --> 10:22.259
You all right?

10:25.375 --> 10:26.889
Yeah, I'm good.

10:29.811 --> 10:32.318
- What are you doing?
- We're done for the day.

10:33.187 --> 10:34.623
You said the session
was for an hour.

10:34.632 --> 10:36.615
Yes, but from the moment you
came through that door,

10:36.633 --> 10:39.107
- your mind has been somewhere else.
- What are you talking about?

10:39.131 --> 10:40.436
Derek, you don't get it.

10:40.742 --> 10:43.116
You're gonna need to use
every ounce of your energy

10:43.124 --> 10:44.573
if you want to walk again.

10:45.536 --> 10:47.001
I got a lot going on.

10:47.745 --> 10:49.250
I can see that.

10:50.012 --> 10:51.705
And that's what's
holding you back.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.349
Not your legs.

10:58.041 --> 11:00.423
You tell me to trust you, and
then you flip-flop on me?

11:00.752 --> 11:02.342
"Men of Midtown"? Come on.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.844
Shooting it down would've
made me look like an amateur.

11:04.891 --> 11:06.515
You should've had
our backs in there.

11:06.550 --> 11:07.884
You did look like an amateur.

11:07.922 --> 11:09.645
- Okay, all right.
- Hey. Let her talk.

11:09.679 --> 11:12.509
- I need that tour.
- You want that man to respect you?

11:12.561 --> 11:15.306
Try forming an opinion of
your own and sticking to it.

11:15.323 --> 11:16.926
Listen, young lady,
right about now,

11:16.952 --> 11:19.007
I'm the only friend you
got at this label.

11:19.097 --> 11:20.543
I am fighting for you.

11:20.668 --> 11:23.107
- For us or Carlotta?
- Does it matter?

11:23.355 --> 11:26.284
- I'm on the team.
- Really? 'Cause to me, it kind of seems

11:26.309 --> 11:27.490
like he's all about himself.

11:27.502 --> 11:30.805
- Don't it feel like that?
- Yeah, a good A&R fights for his artists.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.722
Now we're seeing just
how good he isn't.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.684
Control them.

11:39.842 --> 11:42.349
The man who used my daughter.

11:42.718 --> 11:45.374
My ex-business partner.

11:45.670 --> 11:47.136
Don Talbot.

11:47.261 --> 11:50.072
He needs to pay for
what he did to me.

11:51.162 --> 11:52.845
What do you need?

11:53.572 --> 11:55.245
His daughter runs his label,

11:55.266 --> 11:58.393
and she's everything
Ayanna never was.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.561
And you want what?

12:02.454 --> 12:06.388
I need you to find out their
next move, and deliver it.

12:07.002 --> 12:10.898
This music game is like a...
round of chess.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.796
Even if the moves don't
come for years later.

12:13.831 --> 12:16.189
You get me that victory,

12:16.243 --> 12:19.070
and your boys will
open for Noah.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.043
We need to get it right
and win this sing-off.

12:29.828 --> 12:31.672
So remember, on
the second verse,

12:31.699 --> 12:33.869
we're gonna do this twice.

12:33.888 --> 12:35.638
- Right.

not going back to juvie.

I need to holler at you
for a second, Alex.

15:13.688 --> 15:15.584
I'll catch up with you guys.

15:16.136 --> 15:18.094

- Okay.

I know that I'm probably
crazy for asking you,

15:20.876 --> 15:24.949
but I need you to take a listen
to something I'm working on.

15:25.074 --> 15:26.861
Are you serious?

15:27.091 --> 15:29.545
I could've sworn I have
my own album to write,

15:29.635 --> 15:32.115
and to try to win
this for my group.

15:32.922 --> 15:34.282
Please?

15:34.651 --> 15:37.078
I have to write this
album in a month.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.867
One track.

15:39.261 --> 15:40.545

get that opening spot,

back to Miami, so, yeah.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.624

going back to juvie.

15:57.846 --> 15:59.351

16:00.095 --> 16:02.190
Well, Ayanna was gonna
pursue guardianship,

16:02.211 --> 16:04.484
but it got all messed up, so...

16:04.519 --> 16:06.231
So what are you gonna do?

16:06.397 --> 16:09.629
Find a new foster
home, run away.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.669
Or I could get married.

16:11.794 --> 16:14.115
That's how messed up the

16:14.696 --> 16:16.007

I feel at the moment.

19:35.006 --> 19:37.465

to go to a rehearsal,

song got on the radio?

19:59.833 --> 20:01.715
There's crazies outside.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.259
I could ask you the same thing.

24:03.871 --> 24:05.944
I'm in from Maryland

24:08.834 --> 24:10.224
Seems stressful.

Very.

24:13.375 --> 24:15.435
I'm trying to close an

Hey, listen. Can I
tell you something?

You have to be very careful
in this bar because men,

24:21.989 --> 24:24.550
they'll just come up to you.
They'll try to talk to you.

24:24.748 --> 24:26.993
They might even try
to buy you a drink.

24:27.041 --> 24:29.665

Ain't nobody even

You can't tell me, but
you can tell them?

25:38.255 --> 25:40.946

33:35.333 --> 33:38.843
Just the both of us, every
night a different city...

33:38.882 --> 33:40.091
Okay, you were right.

33:40.514 --> 33:43.508
What we have between us and
the music, it is special.

33:44.701 --> 33:46.975
Look, I'll do whatever I
got to do to help you.

33:47.369 --> 33:51.550
I'll get up on stage,
smile, sing, all that.

33:52.482 --> 33:54.376
But one thing I
will not let you do

33:54.387 --> 33:56.369
is get in between
me and my girls.

33:56.800 --> 33:57.908
Okay?

33:58.224 --> 34:00.191
'Cause once this is all over,

34:00.431 --> 34:02.851
I'm going right back to
them when we're done.

34:04.297 --> 34:05.515
Fair enough.

34:07.247 --> 34:08.688
So, about that track

34:09.081 --> 34:10.911
- that you played me...
- Mm-hmm.

34:11.210 --> 34:12.447
I have some thoughts.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.482
Yeah? Good thoughts?

34:14.607 --> 34:17.315
- I hate it.
- Ugh. I know, I know...

34:17.815 --> 34:19.010
Mmm.

34:20.069 --> 34:22.346
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thank you.

34:22.382 --> 34:23.880
You bet. Enjoy.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.126
Heard you were holed
up in a hotel.

34:43.254 --> 34:44.902
Why all the theatrics?

34:45.163 --> 34:46.985
I come from a theatrical family.

34:47.014 --> 34:48.784
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.009
And I'm here on business.

34:53.663 --> 34:56.481
You don't have any business,
from what I understand.

34:57.934 --> 35:00.747
I want Take Three on
the Noah Brooks tour.

35:03.757 --> 35:05.976
You won't be laughing when
you lose your sponsor.

35:06.593 --> 35:08.618
I highly doubt that.

35:09.311 --> 35:12.445
I put that deal in place when
I was the head of the label.

35:13.142 --> 35:14.932
The CEO is a friend of mine.

35:15.126 --> 35:18.773
She agreed to do it, despite
being one of the many women

35:18.795 --> 35:21.193
whose asses you grabbed
over the years.

35:21.207 --> 35:23.279
What a ridiculous accusation.

35:23.656 --> 35:25.037
Is it?

35:25.392 --> 35:28.162
If you lose your sponsor,
everyone will know why.

35:31.117 --> 35:33.246
Good luck trying to find
another one to sign on

35:33.272 --> 35:36.055
during the PR nightmare
you'll find yourself in.

35:38.491 --> 35:40.720
You need to keep
your sponsor happy,

35:41.250 --> 35:43.089
which means keeping me happy.

35:45.834 --> 35:47.431

I'm just doing my job.

37:48.042 --> 37:50.522
You made it clear that there
was room for growth here, sir.

37:50.578 --> 37:52.369
Mm. I like loyalty,

37:52.386 --> 37:55.811
but I saw that you stood
up for Take Three.

37:56.717 --> 37:59.615

or Carlotta Brown?

38:03.657 --> 38:05.945
Mm.

38:06.838 --> 38:08.899
Hey, come on in. We
were just celebrating.

38:12.773 --> 38:14.565
Thanks to you...

38:16.947 --> 38:18.392

We just signed one of the
biggest artists in the game,

38:21.676 --> 38:23.673
right out from under Don Talbot.

38:23.703 --> 38:25.734
- Quavo.
- Revenge is sweet.

38:25.785 --> 38:28.050
Well, I guess that makes
us The Men of Midtown.

38:29.081 --> 38:31.582

38:46.397 --> 38:48.320
Mama, why you call me
over here to this place?

38:48.329 --> 38:50.706
- This ain't my church no more.
- But it's <i> my</i> church,

38:50.736 --> 38:52.347
and I'm leaving tomorrow.

38:52.420 --> 38:56.001

39:00.688 --> 39:03.858
I don't want to sing in this place.
I got bad memories here.
