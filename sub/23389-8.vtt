00:02.556 --> 00:04.141
Previously on "The Path"...

00:04.142 --> 00:05.477
‐ The only experience I've had
is with one other

00:05.478 --> 00:06.813
super‐closeted guy
at the church.

00:06.814 --> 00:08.525
‐ Is it Arnie Phillips?

00:08.526 --> 00:12.115
‐ Tonight I want to introduce
the Guardian

00:12.116 --> 00:16.415
who will tend this corner
of the world, Felicia Pickard.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.503
‐ You should've left him
in the ground.

00:18.504 --> 00:21.425
‐ I need you to find
your way back.

00:21.426 --> 00:23.847
‐ You have to tell Eddie
the truth about Steve.

00:23.848 --> 00:27.605
‐ Vera has found some old
diaries of Steve's,

00:27.606 --> 00:30.360
and she thinks you wrote
"The Ladder," or part of it.

00:30.361 --> 00:33.032
‐ She claims Steve stole
the religion from her,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.287
but that's not what
made us cut her off.

00:35.288 --> 00:37.165
It was when she hurt her child.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.961
The poor girl is probably
scarred for life.

00:38.962 --> 00:42.217
‐ I don't need
a secular liaison.

00:42.218 --> 00:45.808
‐ Are you firing me?
‐ I guess I am.

00:45.809 --> 00:49.106
‐ He loves me. The answer
is to find more JPs,

00:49.107 --> 00:52.447
make them my followers,
and then take them with me.

01:33.487 --> 01:37.452
‐ We have grown tenfold
in the last eight months.

01:37.453 --> 01:39.541
Expanded into other countries.

01:39.542 --> 01:42.087
Our message has spread digitally

01:42.088 --> 01:45.301
all over the world.

01:45.302 --> 01:49.268
And all that sounds great.

01:49.269 --> 01:51.773
And it is!

01:51.774 --> 01:55.155
It's an opportunity to do more,

01:55.156 --> 01:59.496
to make a bigger impact.

01:59.497 --> 02:03.922
But growth can be a distraction.

02:03.923 --> 02:09.098
It can distract you from the
growth that really matters.

02:09.100 --> 02:13.024
The growth within.

02:13.025 --> 02:17.032
You see, that is what
I'm afraid is happening

02:17.033 --> 02:19.119
here with us right now.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.415
All of us.

02:21.416 --> 02:27.929
So this is what I want you to
share with everyone, okay?

02:27.930 --> 02:32.062
Our new decree:

02:32.063 --> 02:35.193
Refinement.

02:35.194 --> 02:37.239
At the beginning of next week,

02:37.240 --> 02:40.495
each and every one of us,
all of us,

02:40.496 --> 02:46.173
are going to extract something
harmful from our lives,

02:46.174 --> 02:49.346
and lay it before the light.

02:49.347 --> 02:52.937
I'm not talking about giving
up gin in favor of vodka.

02:52.938 --> 02:56.360
I'm asking you to dig deep.

02:56.361 --> 02:59.826
What is in your life that
just doesn't need to be?

02:59.827 --> 03:02.080
That should not be?

03:02.081 --> 03:06.882
It could be a thing,
a habit, a relationship.

03:06.883 --> 03:10.013
Look, you are all here
because you are the ones

03:10.014 --> 03:13.604
that everyone here

03:13.605 --> 03:16.025
looks up to, okay?

03:16.026 --> 03:19.364
So I need you
to get the word out.

03:19.365 --> 03:23.164
Lead by example.

03:23.165 --> 03:27.757
Okay? Dig deep.

03:27.758 --> 03:31.765
Because I am telling you
if we do this,

03:31.766 --> 03:35.355
The Light will shine so bright

03:35.356 --> 03:39.906
that not a soul can deny it.

03:39.907 --> 03:43.664
And all of those who are lost

03:43.665 --> 03:48.381
will find their way back home.

03:48.382 --> 03:51.262
Thank you all.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.250
‐ You definitely
made your point.

04:06.251 --> 04:08.129
‐ In a good way, or‐‐
‐ No, in the best way possible.

04:08.130 --> 04:10.091
They weren't just listening
to you, they heard you.

04:10.092 --> 04:13.724
‐ Yeah, well, you know, I'm
convinced that we need this.

04:13.725 --> 04:14.851
‐ Well, message received.

04:14.852 --> 04:16.730
Seriously.

04:16.731 --> 04:21.321
Bold action will recalibrate,
unify our membership.

04:21.322 --> 04:23.952
‐ It felt good, it feels right.

04:23.953 --> 04:25.873
They'll get the message out
to the membership.

04:25.874 --> 04:30.716
‐ Yeah, they will. We will.

04:30.717 --> 04:33.847
I couldn't help notice, um...

04:33.848 --> 04:36.478
Sarah wasn't‐‐wasn't there.

04:38.148 --> 04:42.907
‐ Yeah, um... Sarah.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.913
She is on her own personal
journey right now.

04:45.914 --> 04:49.796
I don't know why or where, or
if it's even personal, but...

04:49.797 --> 04:52.008
You know, I just don't have
time to think about it.

04:52.009 --> 04:54.722
You know? About her.

04:54.723 --> 04:56.935
Look she‐‐.

04:56.936 --> 04:59.439
"The Yellow Birch Inn,"
this is all she left me

04:59.440 --> 05:03.574
in case of emergency
with the kids.

05:09.001 --> 05:11.840
‐ Look... if there's
anything you need‐‐

05:11.841 --> 05:14.177
‐ It'll work itself out
one way or another,

05:14.178 --> 05:18.269
but thank you though.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.106
Hey, what are you
guys doing tonight?

05:20.107 --> 05:22.402
If you're free, you want to
come to my house,

05:22.403 --> 05:23.738
have a family dinner with us?

05:23.739 --> 05:25.659
‐ Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.372
‐ Great. 7:00? ‐ Yeah.

05:28.373 --> 05:29.793
‐ All right.

05:33.508 --> 05:35.386
Hey.

05:35.387 --> 05:37.056
‐ I'll be out of here
in just a moment.

05:37.057 --> 05:39.394
Just had a few things
of mine to collect.

05:39.395 --> 05:44.614
‐ Look, I'm not trying
to rush you, I just...

05:44.615 --> 05:48.370
I just never got
a chance to apologize.

05:48.371 --> 05:52.671
And I wish things could've
gone down differently.

05:52.672 --> 05:54.424
‐ Don't be silly, it's, um‐‐

05:54.425 --> 05:56.220
it's just the business.

05:56.221 --> 05:57.765
It's not meant to be nice.

05:57.766 --> 06:00.436
‐ You are incredible
at what you do.

06:00.437 --> 06:02.566
‐ I really don't need
a bunch of smoke blown‐‐

06:02.567 --> 06:04.904
‐ I mean‐‐I mean this.

06:04.905 --> 06:06.783
You are a visionary.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.662
You've helped us grow.

06:08.663 --> 06:12.168
You took us to that
next level, and, Vera,

06:12.169 --> 06:15.759
I'm incredibly
grateful for that.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.598
I've just come to realize
that your outlook,

06:18.599 --> 06:23.817
your entire secular approach
is just not a match for us,

06:23.818 --> 06:26.405
for Meyerism.

06:26.406 --> 06:28.367
‐ Yeah, I um...

06:28.368 --> 06:32.584
I think you're right about that.

06:32.585 --> 06:34.589
More than you know.

06:42.647 --> 06:44.316
My God, you have to see this.

06:44.317 --> 06:45.652
This is amazing.

06:45.653 --> 06:47.488
‐ If it's another video,
I don't‐‐.

06:47.489 --> 06:49.409
No, it's an e‐mail from JP,

06:49.410 --> 06:52.123
and he says that he owes us
a great debt of gratitude

06:52.124 --> 06:54.796
for your wisdom and insight.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.427
‐ That's very kind of him.

06:58.428 --> 07:00.056
‐ Yeah, and he says that
we should be receiving soon

07:00.057 --> 07:01.475
a token of his esteem.

07:01.476 --> 07:03.479
What do you think it is?

07:03.480 --> 07:05.984
‐ Whatever it is, we need
to be discreet about it.

07:05.985 --> 07:08.197
Eddie's showing me a lot
of trust these days,

07:08.198 --> 07:11.036
and cultivating my own patrons
could threaten that‐‐

07:11.037 --> 07:14.417
‐ I don't know
about Eddie's trust.

07:14.418 --> 07:16.338
‐ He invited us to this dinner.

07:16.339 --> 07:19.052
It's symbolic, I know‐‐
‐ Yeah, dinner at the Lane's.

07:19.053 --> 07:21.724
We've finally arrived.

07:21.725 --> 07:24.020
Maybe they're just looking
to fill some chairs.

07:24.021 --> 07:26.274
Vera's gone.
Sarah wasn't around today.

07:26.275 --> 07:28.279
Did you notice that?

07:31.870 --> 07:34.124
"Yellow Birch Inn." .

07:34.125 --> 07:36.796
It's where Sarah is with, well‐‐

07:36.797 --> 07:39.008
whoever she is with.

07:39.009 --> 07:40.930
He pretended it
didn't bother him, but...

07:42.767 --> 07:45.396
‐ "A bucolic bed and
breakfast in the Amish country

07:45.397 --> 07:47.191
"well‐regarded by bird lovers

07:47.192 --> 07:50.574
and those looking
for a romantic escape."

07:55.375 --> 07:57.211
So this guy that we're driving

07:57.212 --> 07:59.424
to Pennsylvania to find now‐‐
SARAH: John Kordjak.

07:59.425 --> 08:01.721
Yeah, him.

08:01.722 --> 08:03.808
You saw his name in one of
Lilith's journals? That's all?

08:03.809 --> 08:06.313
‐ I know how it sounds.
‐ I don't think you do.

08:06.314 --> 08:07.900
‐ You think I'm on
a wild goose chase.

08:07.901 --> 08:09.987
‐ No, I'm not. I don't.
I'm with you.

08:09.988 --> 08:11.657
I just need a little guidance,

08:11.658 --> 08:15.497
like a GPS to the inside
of your brain.

08:15.498 --> 08:17.753
‐ I saw his name on the diaries

08:17.754 --> 08:19.632
that Steve and Lilith
were working on together.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.765
And it just spoke to me, so‐‐
‐ The name? It spoke?

08:23.766 --> 08:26.144
‐ See, now it doesn't sound
like you're with me.

08:26.145 --> 08:28.190
‐ I am. I am, I swear.

08:28.191 --> 08:31.071
‐ It resonated, and somehow I
feel like he's got the answers

08:31.072 --> 08:33.408
that I'm looking for,
so I looked him up.

08:33.409 --> 08:34.953
And he works at a hospital
nearby, so‐‐

08:36.457 --> 08:38.168
‐ I'll never be right.

08:38.169 --> 08:42.760
‐ What? I'm breathing.
I needed to breathe.

08:42.761 --> 08:44.138
I'm here, aren't I?

08:44.139 --> 08:45.725
Can I get some credit for that?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.019
‐ Yes, I'm glad you're here.
Thank you.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.480
‐ I'm really glad you asked me.

08:48.481 --> 08:50.986
I wasn't sure I'd hear from you.

08:50.987 --> 08:52.488
I mean a trip to France
with your ex?

08:52.489 --> 08:54.117
That's not the greatest sign.

08:54.118 --> 08:58.125
‐ That was work, all right?
That's all.

08:58.126 --> 09:01.089
‐ Thank you.

09:01.090 --> 09:03.678
‐ Come back.

09:03.679 --> 09:06.643
Push forward.

09:09.189 --> 09:12.738
Come back, breathing in.

09:12.739 --> 09:16.829
Push forward.

09:16.830 --> 09:21.296
Now turn to center,
keeping your knees bent.

09:21.297 --> 09:24.303
Turn all the way.

09:29.606 --> 09:33.738
Turn, turn, turn.
‐ There's John.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.578
‐ And push forward.

09:46.848 --> 09:49.770
Come back.

09:49.771 --> 09:52.317
Push forward.

09:57.829 --> 09:59.497
‐ How did you find me?

09:59.498 --> 10:01.544
‐ Well, you didn't make it
that difficult.

10:01.545 --> 10:03.130
You're living under
your name you had

10:03.131 --> 10:06.887
before you joined the Movement.

10:06.888 --> 10:09.977
‐ I wasn't trying to hide,

10:09.978 --> 10:13.108
just return to myself.

10:13.109 --> 10:16.365
The individual I lost
when I joined the many.

10:18.579 --> 10:21.709
‐ There's someone I want
to learn more about.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.880
Someone from the early days
of the Movement.

10:23.881 --> 10:26.009
Her name is Lilith.

10:26.010 --> 10:30.267
A patient of Steve's.
You know her.

10:30.268 --> 10:31.937
Anything that you can
tell me about her

10:31.938 --> 10:34.944
would be very helpful.

10:38.577 --> 10:40.705
‐ These kids...

10:40.706 --> 10:44.295
They're the poor people of
our big, prosperous country.

10:44.296 --> 10:47.636
We ship them off to fight our
wars, and they end up here.

10:47.637 --> 10:49.222
Broken.

10:49.223 --> 10:51.476
Forgotten.

10:51.477 --> 10:54.566
I came here to be
of service to them.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.612
And every day that I'm here,
caring for them,

10:56.613 --> 10:58.616
being with them,

10:58.617 --> 11:01.622
I know I'm doing good.

11:01.623 --> 11:04.126
Sarah, so much of
my life was wasted

11:04.127 --> 11:07.174
worshipping someone who turned
out to be nothing but a man

11:07.175 --> 11:09.638
as mortal and as flawed
as any of us.

11:09.639 --> 11:11.600
‐ You really think
it was all a waste?

11:11.601 --> 11:13.938
‐ Don't ask me to go back
to those days, Sarah.

11:13.939 --> 11:16.109
It's too painful!

11:16.110 --> 11:17.654
I'm not just here
trying to help them,

11:17.655 --> 11:19.282
I'm trying to heal myself.

11:19.283 --> 11:23.206
I don't want to open up
any old wounds.

11:23.207 --> 11:27.423
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

11:27.424 --> 11:30.430
‐ I don't know if you heard,
but my father passed.

11:36.275 --> 11:39.196
‐ I am so sorry to hear that.

11:39.197 --> 11:42.203
Hank was one of the good ones.

11:54.102 --> 11:57.108
May his memory be
for a blessing.

12:01.701 --> 12:05.708
And give my regards to your mom.

12:05.709 --> 12:08.338
‐ I'm staying nearby.

12:08.339 --> 12:10.636
The Yellow Birch Inn,
if you change your mind.

12:27.002 --> 12:28.629
‐ Remy?

12:28.630 --> 12:31.092
Hi.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.721
Sorry, it's just, um...

12:32.722 --> 12:34.599
Didn't know where else to...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.645
I mean, four years of marriage,
you never once missed.

12:36.646 --> 12:39.776
Vinyasa Flow with Bianca.

12:39.777 --> 12:41.905
‐ What can I do for you, Vera?

12:41.906 --> 12:43.743
‐ It's about my mother.

12:43.744 --> 12:46.957
‐ Of course it is.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.796
You can buy me a juice.

12:49.797 --> 12:52.342
She burned you?

12:52.343 --> 12:54.055
‐ The scar on my back.

12:54.056 --> 12:56.017
‐ You said you got that
from a car accident

12:56.018 --> 12:57.186
before you could remember.

12:57.187 --> 12:59.190
‐ That's what she told me.

12:59.191 --> 13:02.321
I know you always thought we
had an unhealthy relationship.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.665
‐ But there's a big difference
between unhealthy

13:07.666 --> 13:11.173
and my mother being genuinely‐‐
‐ Crazy.

13:12.802 --> 13:15.388
How long has it been
since you talked to her?

13:15.389 --> 13:17.936
‐ It's not about how long.

13:17.937 --> 13:22.612
‐ So it's only been what?
A week? A few days?

13:22.613 --> 13:24.533
This is what you do, Vera.

13:24.534 --> 13:26.662
This is why we never
really had a marriage.

13:26.663 --> 13:29.041
You vow to cut her
out of your life,

13:29.042 --> 13:30.586
and that lasts maybe
a month before‐‐

13:30.587 --> 13:32.381
‐ Remy.

13:32.382 --> 13:35.262
‐ I can't be a part of
the codependent addiction

13:35.263 --> 13:37.099
you two have to each other.

13:37.100 --> 13:41.984
It took me a long time
to get over you.

13:41.985 --> 13:44.991
Yeah, I'm seeing someone.

13:48.623 --> 13:50.793
‐ That's great.
‐ It is. She's great.

13:50.794 --> 13:54.341
We're not living together
or anything, but it's great.

13:54.342 --> 13:56.095
You know, it's easy.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.599
‐ So what?

13:57.600 --> 14:01.397
It's an Internet date
or something?

14:01.398 --> 14:03.443
‐ That doesn't make
it any less real.

14:03.444 --> 14:05.447
You have to meet somehow.

14:05.448 --> 14:07.242
‐ That's‐‐Okay.
Yes, that's true.

14:07.243 --> 14:10.081
That's true, the city
has so many people,

14:10.082 --> 14:12.502
you know, to find someone,

14:12.503 --> 14:16.344
anyone you can genuinely
connect with, that's‐‐

14:16.345 --> 14:19.099
that feels like a miracle.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.899
‐ So what about you?
Do you have someone?

14:22.900 --> 14:27.742
‐ I thought maybe, but
apparently he doesn't feel

14:27.743 --> 14:30.080
the same way about me.

14:30.081 --> 14:31.750
‐ Well, he sounds like an idiot.

14:37.303 --> 14:40.518
And blessings
to our beloved Hank,

14:40.519 --> 14:43.941
whom death has temporarily
separated from us.

14:43.942 --> 14:49.828
And for Sarah, as she embarks
on a personal journey.

14:49.829 --> 14:51.288
Please illuminate her path.

14:51.289 --> 14:54.336
‐ We pray before
and after meals now?

14:54.337 --> 14:56.675
‐ We pray whenever
we need to pray.

14:56.676 --> 14:58.804
‐ I'll wrap it up.

14:58.805 --> 15:01.434
‐ No, go ahead, Gabby.
‐ No, she's right.

15:01.435 --> 15:05.026
The last thing Hank would want
is for us to postpone pie time.

15:06.863 --> 15:08.699
‐ I'm actually gonna head
back into the city tonight.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.828
Really? Already?

15:10.829 --> 15:13.082
‐ Yeah, um...

15:13.083 --> 15:15.963
The people at the center are
having trouble figuring out

15:15.964 --> 15:17.675
what they're going to
sacrifice for Refinement,

15:17.676 --> 15:21.725
so I said I'd help them out.

15:21.726 --> 15:23.645
‐ That's very kind of you.

15:23.646 --> 15:25.398
But don't you think it's best

15:25.399 --> 15:27.737
if they come to those
decisions on their own?

15:29.742 --> 15:34.333
Yeah, I know, but some of
them haven't done this before.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.089
So I said I'd guide them a bit.

15:37.090 --> 15:38.801
I did too. ‐ What?

15:38.802 --> 15:40.220
‐ I said I'd help some
people out too.

15:40.221 --> 15:42.517
‐ Well, you kids are so giving.

15:42.518 --> 15:44.186
‐ It's true.

15:44.187 --> 15:47.985
‐ Okay, well, drive safe.

15:47.986 --> 15:49.572
Have a good talk.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.908
‐ Sure. ‐ Pie time!

15:50.909 --> 15:52.452
‐ Yeah!

15:52.453 --> 15:55.041
‐ Pie is the one thing
you cannot make me

15:55.042 --> 15:57.379
give up for Refinement,
Eddie, okay?

15:57.380 --> 15:59.007
‐ How often are
you gonna come up

15:59.008 --> 16:01.220
with these new decrees,
by the way?

16:01.221 --> 16:03.266
Russel, not now. I'm tired.

16:03.267 --> 16:05.855
‐ Every month? Every week?

16:05.856 --> 16:07.357
‐ Russel.

16:07.358 --> 16:09.403
‐ The decrees help us.
‐ It's true.

16:09.404 --> 16:14.288
The Movement needed a reset,
and this is how we're doing it.

16:14.289 --> 16:16.125
‐ And Sarah?

16:16.126 --> 16:18.171
Is this how she's doing that?
How she's resetting?

16:18.172 --> 16:21.928
Running around like she doesn't
have a daughter to raise?

16:21.929 --> 16:24.266
I don't know what you've heard,
but the Novices are talking.

16:24.267 --> 16:27.273
The rumor is she disagrees with
the way you're running things.

16:30.404 --> 16:32.825
‐ You know what?

16:32.826 --> 16:36.332
Why don't you focus
on your own work, Russel?

16:36.333 --> 16:40.216
As far as I can tell,
you have plenty of it.

16:44.182 --> 16:46.645
‐ Eddie, would
you like some pie?

16:46.646 --> 16:49.776
I know Cal does.

16:49.777 --> 16:53.200
‐ That would be great, Mary.
Thank you.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.354
‐ Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

17:08.355 --> 17:10.358
My dad was like
all over me tonight.

17:10.358 --> 17:12.905
I feel like he can, like,
sense something, you know?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.659
I had to make up
this crazy story

17:14.660 --> 17:16.704
about helping some girl
out with her Bible study.

17:16.705 --> 17:19.251
‐ Well, hopefully you're
a better liar than Hawk.

17:19.252 --> 17:21.213
‐ I was not lying. ‐ Please.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.967
Even Grandma saw
right through you.

17:22.968 --> 17:25.054
Like a wet T‐shirt.

17:25.055 --> 17:26.683
‐ That's a terrible reference.

17:26.684 --> 17:30.023
I was just creatively
reinterpreting

17:30.024 --> 17:31.776
the whole Refinement thing.

17:31.777 --> 17:33.362
If my mom can take
a personal journey‐‐

17:33.363 --> 17:35.618
‐ Hey, you don't have
to convince me, okay?

17:35.619 --> 17:38.205
This is heaven! ‐ Thanks, guys‐‐

17:38.206 --> 17:41.211
‐ I found it,
and I never want to leave.

17:41.212 --> 17:43.550
But I do have to pee.

17:43.551 --> 17:45.261
‐ Whoa, slow down, girl!

17:45.262 --> 17:47.808
We don't do lines outside
the bathrooms here.

17:47.809 --> 17:50.773
We do lines inside
the bathrooms.

17:50.774 --> 17:52.860
Right?

17:52.861 --> 17:54.446
‐ You into this?

17:54.447 --> 17:57.912
‐ I'm open.

17:57.913 --> 17:59.582
It's an experience.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.878
‐ Yeah, that it is.

18:01.879 --> 18:04.132
I'm just happy we don't have
to be up closer, though.

18:04.133 --> 18:06.972
‐ And what is your name, sir?

18:08.685 --> 18:12.608
Won't tell me? Okay.

18:12.609 --> 18:15.948
You know, you are just my type!

18:15.949 --> 18:17.284
Closeted!

18:19.455 --> 18:22.460
‐ Is that‐‐
‐ Yeah, yeah, that's Arnie.

18:22.461 --> 18:24.549
Wait, here's the move. We just‐‐

18:24.550 --> 18:25.926
‐ Yeah, what does that mean?

18:25.927 --> 18:27.888
‐ You know what it means,
just...

18:27.889 --> 18:30.101
play it cool.

18:30.102 --> 18:31.730
‐ Aww.

18:31.731 --> 18:33.567
‐ Hello there, young men!

18:33.568 --> 18:37.031
Enjoying a little
cultural scenery?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.579
‐ You know,
when you're in the city,

18:39.580 --> 18:43.127
why not take in
the more colorful sights?

18:43.128 --> 18:45.883
‐ Well, pray for them.
‐ Yeah, don't pray for me.

18:45.884 --> 18:47.510
‐ Excuse me?

18:47.511 --> 18:49.097
‐ We're here for
the same reason you are.

18:49.098 --> 18:53.940
It's just that we're together.

18:53.941 --> 18:55.862
‐ I'm kidding. Believe me.

18:59.828 --> 19:03.292
‐ Um... I'm...

19:03.293 --> 19:04.712
so sorry.

19:04.713 --> 19:07.050
I just wasn't gonna stand here

19:07.051 --> 19:09.639
and pretend like I didn't
know how he treated you.

19:09.640 --> 19:14.774
‐ No, I appreciated it,
like a lot.

19:14.775 --> 19:17.781
It's very heroic of you.

19:23.166 --> 19:25.461
‐ Russel is a ticking bomb.

19:25.462 --> 19:27.048
‐ It's hard to blame him.

19:27.049 --> 19:30.054
Russel's been passed over,
cheated on.

19:30.055 --> 19:32.058
‐ Well, now I know
why Eddie invited us.

19:32.059 --> 19:34.187
He didn't want to be alone
with all that dysfunction.

19:34.188 --> 19:35.732
‐ I choose to think
he's interested

19:35.733 --> 19:37.945
in getting closer to us
as a family.

19:37.946 --> 19:40.952
‐ Excuse me, Mr. Roberts?

19:45.043 --> 19:49.092
‐ "A token of my esteem.
Yours in Light, Jean‐Paul."

19:49.093 --> 19:50.972
What am I signing for? ‐.

20:05.543 --> 20:08.549
‐ My God.

20:21.784 --> 20:23.745
‐ We deserve this,
don't you think?

20:23.746 --> 20:26.083
‐ I do.

20:26.084 --> 20:29.381
I'm not sure that anyone else
would see it in the same way.

20:29.382 --> 20:31.343
‐ I mean, it's payment.
‐ I know.

20:31.344 --> 20:32.930
I'm not sure that anyone else
would see it in the same‐‐

20:32.931 --> 20:34.600
‐ And by anyone else,
you mean Eddie.

20:34.601 --> 20:38.608
‐ Yeah, especially during
this time of Refinement.

20:38.609 --> 20:42.198
It's not exactly on message.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.952
‐ Eddie could've won over JP,

20:43.953 --> 20:46.749
but he was too distracted
by his issues with Sarah.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.545
You had the foresight
to see what he needed,

20:48.546 --> 20:51.341
and you were rewarded for it.

20:51.342 --> 20:53.722
Our plan is working, okay?
We're building our clients,

20:53.723 --> 20:56.226
making connections,
and this car is a sign.

20:56.227 --> 20:57.646
‐ Well, I just wish
he'd send a sign

20:57.647 --> 21:00.026
that was a little less visible.

21:00.027 --> 21:01.445
Eddie would punish us.

21:01.446 --> 21:03.323
‐ Not if he doesn't find out.

21:03.324 --> 21:05.871
I mean, there must be a garage
somewhere out of the way.

21:05.872 --> 21:07.791
We can store it.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.837
This is something for us, okay?

21:09.838 --> 21:13.510
Think about how much
we do for him.

21:13.511 --> 21:15.932
In fact, let's find out
if Sarah is really

21:15.933 --> 21:18.104
having a personal journey
for him.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.825
‐ Good afternoon,
Yellow Birch Inn.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.664
This is Liz.
How can I help you today?

21:27.665 --> 21:30.545
‐ Hi, Liz. My name is Nicole,
and I was wondering

21:30.546 --> 21:32.674
if you could help me
on a secret mission.

21:32.675 --> 21:34.929
My sister Sarah Lane is staying
with you at the Inn, I believe.

21:34.930 --> 21:36.682
‐ I'm really not
supposed to disclose

21:36.683 --> 21:38.352
the names of our guests.

21:38.353 --> 21:40.022
‐ Yeah, it's just that her
and her fiancé,

21:40.023 --> 21:41.651
they just got engaged,

21:41.652 --> 21:43.445
and I wanted to send
them a secret gift.

21:43.446 --> 21:45.074
Will you let me know if they
checked in already?

21:45.075 --> 21:49.374
‐ Well, I shouldn't,
but yes, they have.

21:49.375 --> 21:52.882
‐ Thank you so much.
And remember, not a word!

21:55.220 --> 21:58.351
‐ Does feel good, doesn't it?

22:02.819 --> 22:05.615
‐ I was doing some research,

22:05.616 --> 22:07.201
and it turns out that
there are some

22:07.202 --> 22:10.082
really interesting
restaurants in the area.

22:10.083 --> 22:12.963
One of them even grows
its own produce.

22:12.964 --> 22:17.514
It's about an hour from here.
‐ Sorry?

22:17.515 --> 22:19.727
‐ I was talking about lunch,
you know?

22:19.728 --> 22:25.321
Leaving this place for
sustenance of some kind.

22:25.322 --> 22:29.412
You've got to be hungry by now.
‐ Not really.

22:29.413 --> 22:31.542
I'm gonna stay here, if you
don't mind. You go.

22:31.543 --> 22:33.546
‐ You're just gonna sit there
and wait? For how long?

22:33.547 --> 22:36.761
‐ However long it takes.

22:36.762 --> 22:41.394
‐ Look, I gotta say
that I'm feeling‐‐

22:41.395 --> 22:43.273
‐ What?

22:43.274 --> 22:44.902
‐ Used.

22:44.903 --> 22:46.822
You didn't want to spend
some time together,

22:46.823 --> 22:48.910
you just wanted a chaperone
for this wild goose chase.

22:48.911 --> 22:50.914
‐ No, I told you the reason
why I wanted to come here.

22:50.915 --> 22:53.586
‐ He didn't talk to you.
He said nothing.

22:53.587 --> 22:55.381
And you're just sitting
here waiting!

22:55.382 --> 22:58.053
‐ Because he was shocked
to see me. He will come.

22:58.054 --> 22:59.472
‐ How do you know?
‐ Because I know.

22:59.473 --> 23:01.226
‐ Well, there it is. ‐ What?

23:01.227 --> 23:04.107
‐ Right there. Classic,
incurable, terminal‐‐

23:04.108 --> 23:06.988
‐ What?

23:06.989 --> 23:09.995
‐ Blind faith.

23:16.883 --> 23:18.720
‐ What? Are you just packing up?

23:18.721 --> 23:21.057
Just‐‐

23:21.058 --> 23:25.567
‐ You know, I got into this
thing‐‐whatever this is‐‐

23:25.568 --> 23:28.363
because I believed
that you were ready

23:28.364 --> 23:32.288
to leave this belief.

23:32.289 --> 23:35.502
And I have been so patient,
Sarah,

23:35.503 --> 23:37.381
in letting you go
through every step.

23:37.382 --> 23:39.845
‐ Don't do this.
‐ You're never gonna leave.

23:39.846 --> 23:42.517
Especially not now.

23:42.518 --> 23:45.524
Not after your father's death.

23:47.444 --> 23:51.952
It's created a vacuum of loss

23:51.953 --> 23:54.332
for them to fill
with their narratives.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.461
You're just going to replace
one blind faith with another.

23:56.462 --> 23:58.298
‐ You just think you have it
all figured out,

23:58.299 --> 24:00.929
but you don't leave any room
for the possibility of‐‐

24:00.930 --> 24:03.433
I don't know‐‐something
surprising or mysterious,

24:03.434 --> 24:06.064
or maybe not having it make
complete sense!

24:06.065 --> 24:07.818
‐ No, there's a million things
in the world

24:07.819 --> 24:09.320
that don't make any sense,
that are mysterious.

24:09.321 --> 24:11.282
But you...

24:11.283 --> 24:14.288
You're just going deeper,
and deeper, and deeper, and...

24:14.289 --> 24:19.758
And I won't get
sucked in, Sarah.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.639
‐ I'm sorry.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.727
I have to pursue this.

24:36.918 --> 24:38.796
‐ Excuse me?

24:38.797 --> 24:40.842
I was knocking there
for a minute.

24:40.843 --> 24:43.346
‐ Sorry, I was in pretty deep.

24:43.347 --> 24:47.104
‐ I certainly do apologize for
barging in on you like this,

24:47.105 --> 24:49.442
disturbing you
in the act of prayer.

24:49.443 --> 24:51.196
‐ That's right.

24:51.197 --> 24:53.158
‐ I was told this is where
I'd find Eddie Lane.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.788
The man in charge around here.

24:55.789 --> 24:57.626
‐ Yeah.

24:57.627 --> 25:00.380
That's ‐‐that's me.

25:00.381 --> 25:02.761
‐ I didn't expect to see you
sitting on the floor.

25:02.762 --> 25:05.182
‐ Yeah, it helps me
connect with the Earth.

25:05.183 --> 25:06.434
The center of everything.

25:06.435 --> 25:07.896
‐ How interesting.

25:07.897 --> 25:10.359
In my faith,
we aim for the heavens.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.198
What's above us, not below.

25:13.199 --> 25:15.077
But to each his own.

25:15.078 --> 25:18.416
Reverend William Matthews
of the Porter Mountain Church.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.047
Folks there call
me Pastor Billy.

25:21.048 --> 25:22.842
You're welcome to do the same.

25:22.843 --> 25:24.596
‐ Nice to meet you.

25:24.597 --> 25:26.182
Is there something
I can help you with?

25:26.183 --> 25:28.144
‐ I certainly hope so.

25:28.145 --> 25:30.482
I'm here to talk to you
about my son, Caleb,

25:30.483 --> 25:32.278
and your son, Hawk.

25:32.279 --> 25:34.700
‐ Okay. What about him?

25:34.701 --> 25:39.375
‐ I see I'm going to have
to be the bearer of bad news.

25:39.376 --> 25:43.049
‐ Did they do something?
‐ In a manner of speaking.

25:43.050 --> 25:44.595
It's been brought
to my attention

25:44.596 --> 25:46.765
that their friendship
is inappropriate.

25:46.766 --> 25:49.103
Now it is my hope that
you and I, as men of God,

25:49.104 --> 25:52.151
can come together
and put a stop to it.

25:52.152 --> 25:55.073
‐ I'm sorry, I'm not following.

25:55.074 --> 25:58.288
How is their friendship
inappropriate?

25:58.289 --> 26:00.334
‐ I don't want you
to think I'm like

26:00.335 --> 26:03.256
those crazy folks in Westboro,
shouting death to homosexuals.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.801
‐ Wait, did you just say‐‐

26:04.802 --> 26:07.264
‐ At our church,
we love the sinner.

26:07.265 --> 26:09.853
But we cannot condone the sin.

26:09.854 --> 26:11.523
‐ Wait, wait.

26:11.524 --> 26:16.032
Are you saying that our sons
are gay together?

26:16.033 --> 26:20.248
Look, Hawk isn't gay, okay?
He would've told me.

26:20.249 --> 26:21.877
‐ I understand.

26:21.878 --> 26:24.465
It's not easy to accept.
Terrible.

26:24.466 --> 26:26.386
Take your time,
and when you're ready,

26:26.387 --> 26:27.931
we can discuss what to do.

26:27.932 --> 26:31.563
‐ No, this isn't terrible,
it's just‐‐.

26:31.564 --> 26:34.569
Listen, if your son and my son

26:34.570 --> 26:39.286
are in a romantic something‐‐
I'm not saying that they are.

26:39.287 --> 26:41.290
But I wouldn't
do a thing about it

26:41.291 --> 26:44.255
other than accept him
completely.

26:44.256 --> 26:46.677
I'm not gonna love him
one bit less.

26:46.678 --> 26:49.181
‐ You think I don't love my son?

26:49.182 --> 26:50.810
You think that's what this is?

26:50.811 --> 26:52.312
That I don't love him?

26:52.313 --> 26:55.152
I love him so much
that I will not spend

26:55.153 --> 26:58.032
an eternity separated from him.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.955
Not because some hippy boy
lured him into a sex trap.

27:00.956 --> 27:04.378
‐ Hey, I don't know who you
think that we are,

27:04.379 --> 27:06.884
but to be honest, I don't care.

27:06.885 --> 27:12.352
You can think whatever
the hell you want about us.

27:12.353 --> 27:18.323
But I cannot change who your
son is, and neither can you.

27:18.324 --> 27:20.327
So whatever you came
here to ask‐‐

27:20.328 --> 27:22.791
‐ You don't worry about who
he is. I'll take care of that.

27:22.792 --> 27:26.548
Why don't you focus on your own?

27:26.549 --> 27:29.429
You don't even know
what he's doing.

27:42.121 --> 27:43.707
‐ Should we wait
for Vera to begin?

27:43.708 --> 27:45.795
‐ I don't believe she'll
be coming tonight.

27:45.796 --> 27:46.838
‐ Is everything okay?

27:46.839 --> 27:51.807
‐ Everything's fine.

27:51.808 --> 27:53.727
‐ Your pulse is racing.

27:53.728 --> 27:56.608
You should sit.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.029
‐ I haven't heard from her
since she got back from France.

27:59.030 --> 28:00.825
She won't return my calls.

28:00.826 --> 28:02.954
‐ Well, did you do
something to upset her?

28:02.955 --> 28:05.627
‐ It's my fault?
‐ Of course not.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.258
‐ I want you to call her.

28:09.259 --> 28:10.510
‐ What do you want me to say?

28:10.511 --> 28:12.724
‐ The truth about my illness.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.769
Maybe she'll listen
if it comes from you.

28:14.770 --> 28:16.607
‐ I thought you didn't
want to upset her.

28:16.608 --> 28:18.694
‐ I didn't.

28:18.695 --> 28:21.701
But it's time.

28:28.757 --> 28:31.763
Let's go inside and begin.

28:45.999 --> 28:48.127
I just spoke with Vera.

28:48.128 --> 28:51.092
Unfortunately, she won't be
able to join us today.

28:51.093 --> 28:55.016
But she asked me
to relay fantastic news.

28:55.017 --> 28:57.229
France was a rousing success.

28:57.230 --> 29:02.155
Felicia Pickard has been named
Guardian of the Third Corner.

29:02.156 --> 29:04.619
‐ It's everything you predicted.

29:04.620 --> 29:09.253
‐ It's not long now, is it?
The cleansing of the Earth?

29:09.254 --> 29:13.136
We're gonna be free of what
this world has become.

29:13.137 --> 29:16.601
‐ Yes.

29:16.602 --> 29:17.855
Yes.

29:40.859 --> 29:43.865
‐ Hey. ‐ Hey.

29:52.883 --> 29:56.222
‐ I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to not break the yoke.

29:56.223 --> 29:58.100
‐ You're making breakfast?

29:58.101 --> 30:01.398
‐ I always made breakfast.
‐ You never made breakfast.

30:01.399 --> 30:03.654
‐ Right. I knew it was one
or the other.

30:07.704 --> 30:09.708
You feel guilty.

30:11.754 --> 30:13.632
Is it because I have
a girlfriend?

30:13.633 --> 30:15.761
‐ No, no, no.

30:15.762 --> 30:17.013
No.

30:17.014 --> 30:19.184
‐ It's because of the other guy.

30:19.185 --> 30:22.859
The one you actually want
to be making breakfast for.

30:22.860 --> 30:26.115
‐ Well, it's not just him.

30:26.116 --> 30:30.708
He's part of this whole
community and I was‐‐

30:30.709 --> 30:34.172
I was actually happy
there sometimes.

30:34.173 --> 30:36.093
Can you imagine that?

30:36.094 --> 30:37.763
‐ Not‐‐not really.

30:37.764 --> 30:40.352
I've heard of such things, but‐‐.

30:41.814 --> 30:44.820
Is that your mother?

30:51.499 --> 30:53.377
Is it your mother?

30:53.378 --> 30:56.216
‐ I don't recognize the number.
‐ It's your mother.

30:56.217 --> 30:57.845
Go ahead, answer it.

30:57.846 --> 31:00.809
You're gonna run back
to her eventually.

31:00.810 --> 31:04.609
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it to be‐‐.

31:04.610 --> 31:06.571
Listen, I'm gonna hop
in the shower.

31:06.572 --> 31:08.199
It would really help me

31:08.200 --> 31:11.206
if you wouldn't be here
when I get out.

31:21.142 --> 31:22.979
‐ Vera, it's Dr. Costa.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.024
I need to talk to you
about your mother's health.

31:25.025 --> 31:28.239
‐ Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.034
I thought we owed it
to your grandfather

31:30.035 --> 31:32.288
to finish what he started.

31:32.289 --> 31:36.463
Anything new in your life
lately going on?

31:36.464 --> 31:37.925
‐ Not really, no.

31:37.926 --> 31:40.556
‐ No?

31:40.557 --> 31:42.183
‐ What?

31:42.184 --> 31:43.436
‐ Nothing you want to talk
to me about, or‐‐

31:43.437 --> 31:45.983
‐ No.

31:45.984 --> 31:50.994
‐ Because you know, I was
visited by Reverend Matthews.

31:53.206 --> 31:54.249
‐ What?

31:54.250 --> 31:55.919
‐ Caleb's father.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.257
‐ I don't understand, what‐‐

31:58.258 --> 32:00.219
‐ I'm not mad at you, okay?

32:00.220 --> 32:02.725
I just want to talk
to you about this.

32:02.726 --> 32:04.394
‐ What did he say? What did he‐‐

32:04.395 --> 32:06.941
‐ Kid, I am on your side
100%, okay?

32:06.942 --> 32:08.319
You need to know that.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.239
‐ Just tell me what he told you!

32:10.240 --> 32:13.872
‐ He said that you and his son
were in a relationship.

32:13.873 --> 32:16.879
A romantic relationship.

32:22.348 --> 32:26.648
Hey, bud. Just talk to me.
It's fine.

32:26.649 --> 32:29.529
‐ This is not how I wanted
you to find out.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.408
Literally, the last
possible way.

32:32.409 --> 32:35.039
‐ Okay, look, it's done,
all right?

32:35.040 --> 32:39.089
Just tell me what's going on.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.970
‐ Nothing, okay?
Nothing's going on.

32:41.971 --> 32:44.725
I'm not different.
I don't feel any different.

32:44.726 --> 32:47.773
I just met someone and they
happen to be a guy!

32:47.774 --> 32:52.407
‐ Okay, look, I just‐‐
I wish you would've come to me.

32:52.408 --> 32:54.161
You must've been struggling‐‐

32:54.162 --> 32:55.747
‐ Yeah, I wasn't really
struggling, actually.

32:55.748 --> 32:58.712
‐ Hawk, it kills me
that you didn't feel like

32:58.713 --> 33:01.843
you could talk to me about this.

33:01.844 --> 33:03.597
‐ As my leader?

33:03.598 --> 33:05.851
As the Guardian of the Light,
or as my Dad?

33:05.852 --> 33:09.525
‐ Hey, I'm your father
first and foremost,

33:09.526 --> 33:14.201
but I cannot support you unless
I know what is going on.

33:14.202 --> 33:19.629
Look, I'm not going to judge
you or love you any less.

33:19.630 --> 33:23.553
But you gotta talk to me.

33:23.554 --> 33:25.473
‐ All right, where's Mom?

33:25.474 --> 33:27.435
Who's she with?
What is she doing?

33:27.436 --> 33:30.191
And why is everyone pretending
like it's completely normal

33:30.192 --> 33:33.364
when it is in fact
super fucked up?

33:33.365 --> 33:36.411
‐ I wish I knew.

33:36.412 --> 33:37.665
Okay?

33:37.666 --> 33:44.135
I really don't, Hawk.

33:44.136 --> 33:46.390
‐ So why did you ask me
to help you finish

33:46.391 --> 33:48.687
my dead grandfather's tree house

33:48.688 --> 33:51.567
when all you wanted to do was
grill me about my private life?

33:51.568 --> 33:56.118
‐ I wanted to spend some time
with you man to man.

33:56.119 --> 34:01.003
‐ Yeah, well, here's
my Reflection, all right?

34:01.004 --> 34:05.303
My relationship with Caleb

34:05.304 --> 34:07.266
is my business.

34:09.771 --> 34:13.610
We're given only as much
pain as we can bear.

34:13.612 --> 34:17.828
‐ We're given only as much pain
as we can bear.

34:17.829 --> 34:20.373
‐ Why are we here?

34:20.375 --> 34:23.088
‐ 'Cause I'm asking
people to Reflect

34:23.089 --> 34:26.554
and Refine
when I haven't myself.

34:26.554 --> 34:30.268
‐Why not?
What's holding you back?

34:30.270 --> 34:33.275
‐ My fear.

34:33.275 --> 34:36.616
‐ What are you afraid of?

34:36.617 --> 34:38.870
‐ Losing them.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.875
‐ Who? Who are you losing?

34:46.469 --> 34:48.263
People.

34:48.264 --> 34:50.016
My followers.

34:50.018 --> 34:52.105
I'm losing them.

34:52.106 --> 34:55.570
The Light. My son.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.658
‐ Your son. Good.

34:57.659 --> 35:00.246
‐ My boy.

35:00.247 --> 35:04.212
‐ Why are you losing him?

35:04.213 --> 35:07.553
‐ He doesn't trust me anymore.

35:07.554 --> 35:12.061
‐ Fear. We know the symptoms.

35:12.062 --> 35:15.527
Now let's find the Transgress,
the distraction.

35:15.528 --> 35:17.532
‐

35:20.580 --> 35:23.000
Vera!

35:23.001 --> 35:25.630
‐ Vera? ‐ Vera.

35:25.631 --> 35:27.300
‐ Vera's a beautiful
distraction.

35:27.301 --> 35:29.638
Secular, skilled in the ways
of the world.

35:29.639 --> 35:33.479
Is she really the thing?

35:33.480 --> 35:36.694
Say it, Eddie! I want to get
out of here as much as you!

35:36.695 --> 35:39.282
Maybe not as much.

35:39.283 --> 35:43.332
You can only be free
if you say it.

35:43.333 --> 35:45.671
Who is it you're holding onto?

35:49.805 --> 35:51.641
‐ Sarah!

35:51.642 --> 35:53.393
‐ Sarah.

35:53.394 --> 35:56.149
‐ Sarah. Sarah.

35:56.150 --> 35:57.694
‐ Sarah.

35:57.695 --> 35:59.447
‐ Yes!

35:59.448 --> 36:03.748
‐ Sarah is at
the Yellow Birch Inn

36:03.749 --> 36:07.421
having a romantic
getaway with a man.

36:07.422 --> 36:11.889
A lover.

36:11.890 --> 36:16.106
So what's the real burden,
Eddie?

36:16.107 --> 36:18.696
What can you bear no more?

36:23.539 --> 36:26.752
‐ That I can get hundreds,

36:26.753 --> 36:31.219
thousands of people to believe,

36:31.220 --> 36:32.849
but not her.

36:40.781 --> 36:43.076
‐ Anyone joining you
this morning?

36:43.077 --> 36:47.001
‐ No. I thought maybe but, um‐‐.

36:47.002 --> 36:49.006
Time to go, thank you.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.987
‐ I shouldn't have come.
I should've stayed away.

37:00.988 --> 37:02.574
‐ Please, I'm glad you did.

37:02.575 --> 37:04.787
Do you want to get
a cup of coffee inside?

37:04.788 --> 37:07.166
‐ I can't stay, but I didn't
want to let you go

37:07.167 --> 37:09.755
without at least talking
to you about the past,

37:09.756 --> 37:12.594
about the questions
you were asking.

37:12.595 --> 37:14.807
I haven't heard Lilith's
name in years.

37:14.808 --> 37:17.938
I thought I'd never
hear it again.

37:17.939 --> 37:20.234
But it makes sense that you
would bring her back

37:20.235 --> 37:23.156
into my consciousness.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.537
She was a gifted woman too.

37:25.538 --> 37:27.373
Full of light and inspiration.

37:27.374 --> 37:29.628
She made great contributions
in her early days.

37:29.629 --> 37:33.636
‐ I've read her writings.
I can see that.

37:33.637 --> 37:36.934
‐ But she was also
touched by madness.

37:36.935 --> 37:41.067
Broken by trauma
and pain that Steve‐‐

37:41.068 --> 37:44.658
‐ That Steve couldn't heal?

37:44.659 --> 37:47.413
‐ That he fed on.

37:47.414 --> 37:49.000
Used.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.505
Assimilated into
his system of belief.

37:53.719 --> 37:56.766
And then he sent her away.

37:56.767 --> 37:59.395
Denied her credit,
denied her very existence.

37:59.396 --> 38:03.320
‐ All of you knew about it,
everyone from the early days.

38:03.321 --> 38:07.078
You, my mother, my father.

38:07.079 --> 38:11.252
My God, how could you
knowingly treat her that way?

38:11.253 --> 38:13.758
‐ There's no excuse.

38:13.759 --> 38:18.100
But when you're enveloped in
faith, you rationalize things.

38:18.101 --> 38:20.437
Little things at first,
for the greater good.

38:20.438 --> 38:23.903
The bigger things
and bigger until...

38:23.904 --> 38:25.489
one day the clouds part,

38:25.490 --> 38:26.992
and you don't even
recognize yourself.

38:26.993 --> 38:31.292
‐ Is this how
all religion ends up?

38:31.293 --> 38:35.885
Preaching love, and truth,
and peace, and...

38:35.886 --> 38:41.104
You're sitting on buried
secrets and lies.

38:41.105 --> 38:43.108
‐ Maybe.

38:43.109 --> 38:45.112
Maybe that's the cost of faith.

38:45.113 --> 38:47.868
‐ Is Lilith alive?
Can I contact her?

38:47.869 --> 38:50.080
‐ She's alive.

38:50.081 --> 38:52.878
But if you contact her, she
might tell you things, Sarah,

38:52.879 --> 38:54.798
that make it impossible
for you to go back.

38:54.799 --> 38:56.927
‐ I've already given up
so much already.

38:56.928 --> 38:59.808
That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

38:59.809 --> 39:04.735
You have contact with her.
Do you know where she is?

39:04.736 --> 39:07.156
‐ No, I haven't been in contact
with her over the years,

39:07.157 --> 39:10.204
but I've been aware of her.

39:10.205 --> 39:12.249
She's a veterinarian.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.671
On Riverside and 72nd Street.

39:14.672 --> 39:17.134
I know.

39:17.135 --> 39:19.055
She took to healing animals.

39:19.056 --> 39:21.519
It's an impulse I understand.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.960
‐ Did you remember
the canola oil?

39:33.961 --> 39:35.045
‐ Was it on the list?

39:35.046 --> 39:36.799
‐ No, but I told you.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.761
‐ If it's not on the list,
it doesn't happen.

39:38.762 --> 39:41.099
Stop making me feel
like a failure.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.397
‐ Hey, we're on
the same team here.

39:44.398 --> 39:46.860
Is this about Eddie?

39:46.861 --> 39:50.952
‐ This was gonna be the year
that things got better.

39:50.953 --> 39:52.956
Had some responsibility.

39:52.957 --> 39:54.876
Respect.

39:54.877 --> 39:57.089
‐ You know what this
is really about?

39:57.090 --> 39:58.968
Sarah.

39:58.969 --> 40:01.139
Ever since she decided
to go on walkabout,

40:01.140 --> 40:03.853
it's like Eddie
makes us all suffer.

40:03.854 --> 40:06.107
‐ Sarah sneezes,
we all get a cold.

40:06.108 --> 40:07.777
‐ Now this Refinement decree?

40:07.778 --> 40:09.363
What are we supposed to give up?

40:09.364 --> 40:11.578
I mean, look at us. What's left?

40:36.753 --> 40:39.549
‐ What are you giving up?
‐ Nothing.

40:39.550 --> 40:41.804
Dad comes back from France
ranting and raving

40:41.805 --> 40:45.352
about how everyone's
not working hard enough.

40:45.353 --> 40:49.986
Mom's off who knows where?
They're enough as it is.

40:49.987 --> 40:52.993
‐ You still haven't
heard from him?

40:55.415 --> 40:58.963
I'm really sorry, Hawk.

40:58.964 --> 41:01.259
‐ Thanks.

41:01.260 --> 41:04.056
‐ And even though
we're divorced,

41:04.057 --> 41:06.186
I still relied on him.

41:08.525 --> 41:11.572
I looked to him
for my own self‐worth.

41:11.573 --> 41:14.452
And from this day forward,

41:14.453 --> 41:17.959
I am never speaking
to that bastard again!

41:17.960 --> 41:22.176
‐ All I ever cared about
until right now

41:22.177 --> 41:24.639
was likes on Instagram.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.100
‐ But no more.

41:26.101 --> 41:29.482
No more mustard,
no more cigarettes.

41:29.483 --> 41:32.948
My body is my body.

41:38.334 --> 41:42.717
‐ Wow. I am so proud
of all of you.

41:42.718 --> 41:45.765
Your commitment to finding
a deeper connection

41:45.766 --> 41:48.186
to your faith is‐‐

41:48.187 --> 41:50.273
it warms my heart.

41:50.274 --> 41:55.701
You know, as a leader, I can
sometimes lose my own way.

41:55.702 --> 41:59.918
I can sometimes lose focus
of what is at the core

41:59.919 --> 42:02.172
of this for me.

42:02.173 --> 42:06.557
And what that is is all of you.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.102
This beautiful community.

42:28.225 --> 42:30.438
‐ I have something to sacrifice.

42:33.360 --> 42:38.704
A gift that I'm ashamed to admit

42:38.705 --> 42:41.335
I thought might make me happy.

42:44.424 --> 42:47.013
Turns out...

42:48.850 --> 42:54.444
Turns out it was nothing but
one gigantic distraction.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.996
‐ Yeah. ‐ All right.

43:43.918 --> 43:46.047
‐ Whoo. ‐ Nice.

43:49.972 --> 43:53.060
‐ I, um‐‐

43:53.061 --> 43:55.107
I thought about keeping it.

43:58.573 --> 44:00.241
‐ Go, Gaby!

44:00.242 --> 44:01.494
‐ Yeah, Grandma!

44:01.495 --> 44:03.039
‐ All right!

44:03.040 --> 44:04.835
‐ Whoo! ‐ Yeah!

44:07.381 --> 44:09.761
‐ It's okay.

44:09.762 --> 44:11.723
You did well.

44:11.724 --> 44:14.062
Thank you for inspiring me.

44:47.086 --> 44:50.551
‐ Dr. Costa said
your tumor was spreading.

44:50.552 --> 44:52.763
‐ I'm taking the medicine.

44:52.764 --> 44:54.809
I'll have the surgery.

44:54.810 --> 44:56.478
It's nothing.

44:56.479 --> 44:59.026
We have more important
matters to discuss.

44:59.027 --> 45:00.779
‐ What's more important?

45:00.780 --> 45:03.284
‐ Why haven't you called?

45:03.285 --> 45:05.413
What happened after France?

45:05.414 --> 45:09.923
Did Eddie...

45:09.924 --> 45:13.429
He rejected you.

45:13.430 --> 45:15.643
It hurts, but it's for the best.

45:15.644 --> 45:18.941
‐ Just like Remy. ‐ What?

45:18.942 --> 45:22.489
‐ You said the same
when Remy left me,

45:22.490 --> 45:26.873
when he'd had enough
of this, of us,

45:26.874 --> 45:28.669
you said it was for the best.

45:28.670 --> 45:30.965
‐ Okay, but what does this
have to do with Remy?

45:30.966 --> 45:32.593
‐ He was my husband.

45:32.594 --> 45:34.722
‐ He was a detour.
He wasn't your destiny.

45:34.723 --> 45:36.810
‐ I wanted a family.

45:36.811 --> 45:38.730
A life apart from us!

45:38.731 --> 45:41.485
I wanted children.
I still want that!

45:41.486 --> 45:43.072
‐ And you'll have that.

45:43.073 --> 45:45.493
After The Fire,
you will meet someone.

45:45.494 --> 45:49.752
You will raise your children
in a better world.

45:49.753 --> 45:52.967
‐ Are you even sick?

45:52.968 --> 45:54.595
‐ Of course I am.

45:54.596 --> 45:57.977
‐ I asked you many times
about your illness,

45:57.978 --> 45:59.731
and you kept telling me
that you were fine.

45:59.732 --> 46:02.277
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

46:02.278 --> 46:07.580
‐ If I ever softened the truth,
it was only to protect you.

46:07.581 --> 46:11.420
‐ And the scar on my back?

46:11.421 --> 46:16.556
Yeah, the one
you burned into me.

46:16.557 --> 46:23.152
Was that to protect me too?

46:23.153 --> 46:24.781
‐ I was ill.

46:24.782 --> 46:27.494
Those people, they made me ill.

46:27.495 --> 46:29.289
‐ I shouldn't have come...

46:29.290 --> 46:31.335
It's never your fault, is it?

46:31.336 --> 46:34.508
‐ I carry the shame of what
I did to you every day.

46:34.509 --> 46:39.309
But I'm glad you know because
we can talk about this now.

46:39.310 --> 46:41.564
Like we always do, you and me.

46:41.565 --> 46:44.655
Always.

47:03.901 --> 47:06.907
‐ Good‐bye, Mom.

47:21.979 --> 47:25.944
‐ Mom.

47:25.945 --> 47:27.656
‐ It's so late!

47:27.657 --> 47:29.492
‐ Yeah, I told her
she could stay up

47:29.493 --> 47:31.581
as long as she went to bed
as soon as you got home.

47:31.582 --> 47:33.752
‐ I missed you.
‐ I missed you too, pumpkin.

47:33.753 --> 47:35.254
So much.

47:35.255 --> 47:37.635
I'll see you in
the morning, okay?

47:37.636 --> 47:39.765
‐ Good night, honey.

47:45.150 --> 47:48.322
‐ Thank you for being here.
I know that it was‐‐

47:48.323 --> 47:50.744
‐ Look, Sarah, don't, okay?

47:50.745 --> 47:54.585
No apologies or excuses‐‐
‐ I wasn't apologizing.

47:54.586 --> 47:56.213
I was trying to explain
why I had to leave.

47:56.214 --> 47:58.008
‐ All right, well,
no more explaining.

47:58.009 --> 47:59.845
There's nothing more to explain.

47:59.846 --> 48:03.018
Look, I just want to‐‐
I just want to say something,

48:03.019 --> 48:05.899
so just let me get it out,
let me say it.

48:05.900 --> 48:09.865
‐ Okay.

48:09.866 --> 48:13.748
‐ Look, people have been
joining the Movement

48:13.749 --> 48:15.794
by the hundreds.

48:15.795 --> 48:17.840
Thousands.

48:17.841 --> 48:19.635
Following me.

48:19.636 --> 48:22.808
They're putting their trust,
their faith,

48:22.809 --> 48:27.275
their lives in my hands.

48:27.276 --> 48:28.945
And I can‐‐

48:28.946 --> 48:31.993
I can't focus on what
I'm supposed to be doing,

48:31.994 --> 48:36.001
because all I'm doing
is thinking about you.

48:36.002 --> 48:37.713
‐ Eddie‐ No.

48:37.714 --> 48:40.426
You questioning.

48:40.427 --> 48:43.933
One foot in, one foot out.

48:43.934 --> 48:45.436
‐ I'm sorry.

48:45.437 --> 48:49.737
‐ No, I don't want
your apologies.

48:49.738 --> 48:54.037
I want you to leave us.

48:54.038 --> 48:55.582
Just make it official.

48:55.583 --> 48:57.544
What you've been doing
for months now

48:57.545 --> 49:01.552
slowly, slowly
just drifting away,

49:01.553 --> 49:04.600
just rip it off now.

49:04.601 --> 49:05.852
Just leave the Movement.

49:05.853 --> 49:08.190
‐ No, I won't leave my family.

49:08.191 --> 49:10.486
Ever.

49:10.487 --> 49:12.699
‐ I am not asking
you to do that.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.745
‐ What if I'm not ready?
I have questions, I do,

49:14.746 --> 49:17.544
but this is my life.

49:19.422 --> 49:22.052
‐ Then do it for me.

49:24.808 --> 49:27.604
Please.

49:27.605 --> 49:29.650
I have Reflected,

49:29.651 --> 49:35.620
and what I've found,

49:35.621 --> 49:39.754
what is holding me back
from my Refinement...

49:42.134 --> 49:45.682
is you.

49:47.352 --> 49:49.355
Okay.

49:49.356 --> 49:52.738
You're right.

49:52.739 --> 49:56.120
I shouldn't peddle
something I think is broken.

49:58.500 --> 50:01.506
Not anymore.

50:53.318 --> 50:55.698
‐ I want to become a Meyerist.

51:20.288 --> 51:23.294
‐ You found me.
