WEBVTT

00:06.310 --> 00:09.096
Troops, we're running low
on fresh water,

00:09.226 --> 00:11.446
so I must speak against
this ridiculous new trend

00:11.576 --> 00:13.056
of handwashing.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.537
Sir, I heard that handwashing
prevents dysentery.

00:15.667 --> 00:19.019
Oh, I'm sorry, Collins,
are you a physician or a barber?

00:19.149 --> 00:21.064
I didn't think so.

00:22.544 --> 00:25.851
Now, time for
my newest invention.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.245
One that shall surely turn
the tide in this conflict.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.860
A musket with a spy glass
attached. I'm calling it...

00:34.991 --> 00:36.993
the "Eyesaac."

00:37.124 --> 00:38.864
- So just your name?
- Right.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.431
But instead of the letter "I,"

00:40.562 --> 00:41.867
I'm spelling it
with the word "eye"--

00:41.998 --> 00:45.697
E-Y-E-- at the front.

00:45.828 --> 00:49.310
Point is, close combat will
soon be a thing of the past,

00:49.440 --> 00:51.442
because the Eyesaac,
E-Y-E,

00:51.573 --> 00:55.011
allows for accurate targeting
of up to--

00:55.142 --> 00:56.795
and I kid you not--
50 yards.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.324
Glory be, I've got eyes
on a British officer.

01:03.454 --> 01:06.327
Now, of course it would be
dishonorable to engage

01:06.457 --> 01:08.416
while, you know,
he's unarmed.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.766
Quite a striking fellow.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.594
He's fit of body,

01:12.724 --> 01:14.987
well-groomed,

01:15.118 --> 01:17.077
ready for action.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.866
Right.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.782
Well, lots of war stuff to do.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.827
Battle is nigh.
And remember,

01:28.958 --> 01:31.482
do not shoot them until

01:31.613 --> 01:33.702
you see the green of his eyes.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.443
<i>Their</i> eyes.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.227
Till you see the green
of their eyes.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.837
I actually didn't notice
if he had green eyes.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.926
<i>They</i> had green eyes.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.197
<i>Oh, I gotta find a way out
of this crypt.</i>

01:50.327 --> 01:51.720
I'm not getting eaten
by a purple worm.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.069
Eaten by a worm?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.375
This game seems
stressful.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.028
This is what Jay
does to relax?

01:56.159 --> 01:57.639
Dungeons & Dragons isn't
about relaxation,

01:57.769 --> 01:59.031
it's about adventure.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.468
Yeah. Nothing says adventure
like eating

02:00.598 --> 02:02.818
a family-size bag of
chips by yourself.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.995
Okay, Jay, you're gonna have
to make a decision. Do you...

02:06.126 --> 02:07.301
Oh, come on. Not again.

02:08.954 --> 02:12.828
I'm sorry, guys, my Internet
- cut out again.
- Yeah, we know.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.004
It's happened, like,
20 times already.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.919
Yeah, well, what do you expect?
It's rural Internet.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.486
You guys get it.
You're from Queens.

02:18.616 --> 02:19.922
That's practically
the country.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.489
Jay, we moved downtown,
by Brett and Shayla.

02:21.619 --> 02:22.838
You did? Wait.

02:22.968 --> 02:23.752
Who's Brett and Shayla?

02:23.882 --> 02:25.188
You haven't met Brett yet? Okay.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.451
He is hilarious.
He fits right in.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.366
We met him at a pub quiz.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.238
Oh...

02:31.368 --> 02:33.544
I'm confused. Is this
part of the game?

02:33.675 --> 02:35.242
Unfortunately, I think
the only game being played here

02:35.372 --> 02:36.330
is an adult man

02:36.460 --> 02:38.506
trying to maintain
long-distance friendships.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.638
I don't get it. Couldn't...
a hotspot or something?

02:40.769 --> 02:42.510
Oh, great, you're back.
Hey, can you hear me?

02:42.640 --> 02:45.077
Do we just ask Brett
to take Jay's spot?

02:45.208 --> 02:46.427
What? Brett can't have my spot.
No way.

02:46.557 --> 02:47.906
What are you thinking, should we
just kill Jay's character?

02:48.037 --> 02:48.907
No, guys,

02:49.038 --> 02:50.996
I can hear you.

02:51.127 --> 02:53.608
I'm sad to lose Jay.
But Brett? Hello?

02:53.738 --> 02:54.870
I hate Brett.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.219
Wow. Hard to imagine

02:56.350 --> 02:58.047
feeling this betrayed
by friends.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.223
Didn't your best friend sleep
with your wife?

03:00.354 --> 03:03.444
Yes, Sasappis. Thank you
for that helpful example.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.489
So you want me to just take down
the whole shed?

03:05.620 --> 03:07.361
Yeah, it's kind of an eyesore.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.233
Oh.

03:11.582 --> 03:15.369
What on earth is
the meaning of this?

03:17.588 --> 03:18.981
Oh, yeah, this place
will come down real easy.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.548
Come down?

03:20.678 --> 03:22.071
I'll have you know
these barracks

03:22.202 --> 03:23.725
are the sovereign territory
of his Royal Highness

03:23.855 --> 03:25.292
King George III.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.468
And look at this one.

03:27.598 --> 03:28.730
- Gawking.
- Sorry.

03:29.513 --> 03:30.775
Mark.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.255
Sorry, Mark.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.431
Uh, just leave the shed.

03:34.562 --> 03:35.824
I have a meeting.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.913
We'll talk later.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.697
- She can see us.
- Remarkable.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.351
Indeed.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.049
Hey. Uh, did you guys know
there's three British soldiers

03:44.180 --> 03:46.835
from the Revolutionary War
living in our garden shed?

03:46.965 --> 03:47.836
Don't worry about them.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.054
They mostly stick
to themselves.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.795
They come up
to the main house

03:50.926 --> 03:52.971
once every year or so with
some dispute or complaint.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.235
They've never gotten
over losing the war.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.585
Well, those limeys can wipe
their eyes with crumpets.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.327
'Cause this land is,
and has always been, American.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.763
Said the guy from Massapequa.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.939
Ever since the war,
the agreement's been

04:04.069 --> 04:05.941
the Americans get the house,
the Brits get the shed.

04:06.071 --> 04:06.637
No, no,

04:06.768 --> 04:07.943
no, no.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.162
Oh, no. What is it, Jay?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.947
Hitch died.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.818
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.820
That's awful. He was a...

04:15.951 --> 04:17.518
really...

04:17.648 --> 04:18.780
You have no idea
who Hitch is, do you?

04:18.910 --> 04:21.086
- I do not.
- He was my D&D character.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.305
Oh. No, not to
be insensitive,

04:22.436 --> 04:24.873
it's just, doesn't he exist
entirely in your head?

04:25.003 --> 04:26.440
What is it, Pete?

04:26.570 --> 04:29.486
I-I just wanted to say, as
a long-time adventurer myself,

04:29.617 --> 04:32.446
the bond between D&D creator
and character

04:32.576 --> 04:33.969
can be very real.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.840
I know I shed a few tears
when I lost Gelvin Monkspear

04:35.971 --> 04:37.320
to the demogorgon.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.627
Pete's saying he can relate,
'cause he got upset

04:39.757 --> 04:41.846
about losing some character
- to a demidragon.
- Demogorgon.

04:41.977 --> 04:42.847
Demogorgon?

04:42.978 --> 04:44.806
Pete plays D&D?

04:44.936 --> 04:46.895
Heck yeah. It was
really popular in the '80s.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.593
Hey, maybe Jay and I
could play together.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.508
Oh, that's really sweet-- Pete
wishes he could play with you.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.206
Whoa, we totally could
do that. Hey, Pete,

04:54.337 --> 04:56.948
Pete, listen, you pick
a character and I'll DM,

04:57.079 --> 04:59.908
and then Sam... Sam,
all you have to do

05:00.038 --> 05:01.213
is translate,
like you're doing right now.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.085
- I love this idea!
- Oh, no, no, no.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.739
I mean, I love you,
obviously,

05:04.869 --> 05:05.957
but fantasy role-playing games

05:06.088 --> 05:07.916
are at the far end
of that affection.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.918
Yeah. Okay, cool.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.094
All my best friends
just broke up with me,

05:12.224 --> 05:13.791
but, uh, I can see

05:13.922 --> 05:17.360
that playing a game is...
is too big of an ask.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.493
Okay, we can play tonight.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.799
Yes! Oh!

05:21.930 --> 05:23.366
Pete, saddle up, baby!

05:23.497 --> 05:25.281
- Oh, no.
- Whoo!

05:25.412 --> 05:27.936
- Tonight we ride!
- Rrroo!

05:28.066 --> 05:29.807
<i>We demand parley</i>

05:29.938 --> 05:31.418
at once!

05:31.548 --> 05:32.767
Ugh, these fools.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.899
Oh, boy.
What's going on here?
Aah!

05:35.030 --> 05:35.813
She <i>can</i> see us.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.902
My God,

05:38.033 --> 05:40.165
what foul deal with the devil
hath provoked such a power?

05:40.296 --> 05:42.167
She fell down the stairs,
and when she woke up

05:42.298 --> 05:44.169
she could talk to
ghosts and animals.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.781
Uh, no. I'm not sure
where she got the animals thing.

05:46.911 --> 05:47.956
But I'm Samantha. Hi.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.479
Lieutenant-Colonel
Nigel Chessum.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.569
I've come to discuss
the unprovoked attack

05:52.700 --> 05:54.136
on our land.
I don't know

05:54.266 --> 05:55.442
if I'd say
this is your land.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.660
Yeah, give 'em hell, Sass!

05:56.791 --> 05:57.879
USA!

05:58.009 --> 05:59.924
USA!
Are you talking
about the door?

06:00.055 --> 06:03.232
This is about dignity
and decorum and...

06:03.363 --> 06:04.929
Yes, the door.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.757
We want it put back, and we
won't accept anything less.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.064
Sam?

06:09.194 --> 06:12.197
Have you seen
my yellow Decepticons shirt?

06:12.328 --> 06:13.460
Oh, I think it's in the dryer.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.896
Uh-uh, I checked.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.071
I'll come help you in a sec.
I'm just dealing

06:16.201 --> 06:18.160
with some British ghosts
from the Revolutionary War.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.553
Okay. I'll check the hamper.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.730
Sorry, you were saying?

06:22.860 --> 06:25.472
Our barracks.
This affront shall not go un...

06:25.602 --> 06:26.864
Oh, fine, I'll-I'll do it.

06:26.995 --> 06:27.996
Pardon?

06:28.126 --> 06:29.606
I'll tell the contractor

06:29.737 --> 06:30.825
to put the door back on.
Anything else?

06:30.955 --> 06:34.437
Oh. Um, I...

06:34.568 --> 06:37.745
had sort of a lengthy diatribe
planned, but, uh, splendid.

06:37.875 --> 06:38.746
- Well,

06:38.876 --> 06:39.790
shall we get out of here, sir?

06:39.921 --> 06:41.618
Oh, yes.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.881
I suppose there's
no reason to linger.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.927
No other reason I can think of.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.146
Sam, I believe that shirt
that Jay's looking for

06:48.277 --> 06:50.584
is in the hallway closet
upstairs...

06:53.195 --> 06:54.849
Lieutenant-Colonel Chessum.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.025
Captain Higgintoot.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.244
What, um...
what fortune prompts

06:59.375 --> 07:01.551
such an unexpec... pected visit?

07:01.682 --> 07:04.859
A... trivial matter,
now concluded.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.513
Hmm.I...

07:06.643 --> 07:08.340
do hope my presence,
though unexpected,

07:08.471 --> 07:10.386
is not entirely unpleasant.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.693
Oh, no, I think it's fair to say

07:12.823 --> 07:15.522
that your presence is the
furthest thing from unpleasant.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.045
Okay, am I nuts,
or is there, like,

07:17.175 --> 07:18.829
crazy chemistry
between these two?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.831
This has been going
on for centuries.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.443
Every year they find some reason
to "redraw the border"

07:23.573 --> 07:25.183
or "extend the truce,"
and neither one of them

07:25.314 --> 07:27.055
- ever makes a move.
- Mm.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.360
- Well, I,
uh, suppose

07:28.491 --> 07:30.537
I shall bid you adieu.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.365
Yes, yes,
and I shall bid adieu to you.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.410
Oh.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.933
What a droll little rhyme.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.239
Oh!

07:39.328 --> 07:40.808
Splendid.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.505
Well...

07:42.636 --> 07:45.769
I guess I'm not going
to fife myself out, am I?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.075
Oh, no.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.555
Baxter?

07:58.608 --> 08:01.176
- Well, back to the closet.
- What?

08:01.306 --> 08:02.743
To look for Jay's shirt.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.397
Right.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.444
<i>You cross the icy river</i>

08:08.575 --> 08:12.361
only to find what nightmares
lurk on the other side.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.406
From forth
the darkness of the cave

08:14.537 --> 08:17.714
emerges an abominable yeti!

08:17.845 --> 08:19.237
Ha-ha-ha!

08:19.368 --> 08:20.978
Oh, not good.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.632
We probably should have
taken the mountain pass.

08:22.763 --> 08:25.026
Pete says they should have
- taken the mountain pass.
- Yeah.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.463
That's what we get for accepting
a map from a Frost Giant.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.639
Sass is second-guessing
the Frost Giant.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.293
Well, I'm not messing
with a yeti.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.512
I'm getting back
in the boat.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.078
And Alberta wants
to get back in the boat.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.863
Ooh, unfortunately,

08:35.993 --> 08:37.255
you turn
around to see

08:37.386 --> 08:38.822
that the boat has sunk

08:38.953 --> 08:40.084
into the icy river.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.043
- Oh.
- Escape...

08:42.173 --> 08:43.958
is no longer an option.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.874
Well, then combat it is.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.354
Sam, please tell Jay
that Gelvin Monkspear II

08:49.485 --> 08:51.487
has unsheathed his sword.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.405
Sam? A little focus?
We're about to be devoured

08:56.536 --> 08:57.711
by a ferocious beast over here.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.756
Right. Sorry, it's just,
it's been a few hours.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.628
So is the game
almost done?

09:01.758 --> 09:04.805
Well, I mean, this particular
session could be close to done.

09:04.935 --> 09:05.719
This session?

09:05.849 --> 09:07.634
What do you mean?
Doesn't somebody win

09:07.764 --> 09:09.070
and then, like,
we're done?

09:09.810 --> 09:10.811
No.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.377
This isn't Candy Land, Sam.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.422
Dungeons & Dragons

09:13.553 --> 09:15.685
is not a game that just ends
in one night.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.992
Every campaign is
a multi-chaptered quest.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.298
They could last months
or even years.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.648
Years?

09:21.778 --> 09:22.823
That's what makes it so fun.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.085
Now, where were we

09:24.215 --> 09:25.826
with that yeti?

09:25.956 --> 09:28.568
A little too close
for comfort, I'd say.

09:28.698 --> 09:31.222
Repeat that for Jay. I think
he'd get a kick out of it.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.965
<i>How about those Brits
stopping by, hmm?</i>

09:35.096 --> 09:37.315
Probably won't have to see
them for another few years.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.582
Uh, I have to say,
though, that...

09:42.712 --> 09:45.541
that Nigel fellow seems
like a really good guy.

09:45.672 --> 09:49.589
Oh, well, can't say I agree
with his politics, but, uh...

09:49.719 --> 09:51.634
- he's a man of honor.
- Interesting,

09:51.765 --> 09:54.332
because you're also
kind of a man of honor.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.814
Well, the truth is,
is that there's a secret

09:57.945 --> 09:59.990
that I've been
keeping from Nigel,

10:00.121 --> 10:02.340
and to share it would release
an immense burden,

10:02.471 --> 10:06.083
but I have a feeling he is
not going to take it very well.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.520
Okay, I hear you,
but there's also a chance

10:08.651 --> 10:10.914
that something that seemed so
unthinkable all those years ago

10:11.045 --> 10:13.264
might not be a big deal now.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.266
You're right.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.181
What am I so afraid of?

10:17.312 --> 10:18.966
I'm gonna do it.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.229
Really? You'll talk to him?

10:21.359 --> 10:23.710
Uh-huh. I'm gonna do it.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.059
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.190
What do I wear?

10:26.321 --> 10:29.541
Wait, no, can't change,
so itchy shirt it is.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.501
Break a leg!

10:32.632 --> 10:34.590
<i>Man...</i>

10:34.721 --> 10:37.027
we were up so late
last night, huh?
Were we?

10:37.158 --> 10:39.682
Gosh, I was having so much fun,
I didn't notice.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.162
I could have
gone all night.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.032
You want to know
what my favorite part was?

10:42.163 --> 10:44.426
It was just getting to know
the ghosts a little bit.

10:44.556 --> 10:45.645
Pete? Are you kidding me?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.821
That guy is great.
I didn't think anyone knew more

10:47.951 --> 10:49.126
about '80s basketball
than I did.

10:49.257 --> 10:52.521
Well, early '80s, and then...

10:52.652 --> 10:54.958
You know, if we're gonna get
to the fortress any time soon,

10:55.089 --> 10:56.699
we're gonna have to play
a few times a week,

10:56.830 --> 10:57.787
at least.
And each
of those sessions

10:57.918 --> 10:59.397
would last about...?Not long.

10:59.528 --> 11:02.009
- Five, six hours.
- Wow.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.924
Well, let me check my schedule.
Available.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.317
And that could go on
for potentially years?

11:06.448 --> 11:07.536
Yeah.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.889
Jay, I don't know exactly
how to tell you this, but...

11:13.020 --> 11:15.283
the ghosts don't want to play
with you anymore.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.893
- Whaaat?
- What?

11:17.024 --> 11:18.503
I know. I'm sorry.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.680
But I thought they had fun.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.682
We did have fun.
What are you doing, Sam?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.074
Well, I guess
that not being able

11:24.205 --> 11:26.120
to move the pieces or roll...

11:26.250 --> 11:27.861
Some of them just got
- a little bored.
- Bored?

11:27.991 --> 11:28.862
That's not true.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.037
Okay.
Yes,
it's disappointing.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.952
I'm upset, too. I...

11:32.082 --> 11:35.477
I love this game!
Those darn ghosts!

11:35.607 --> 11:37.392
Well, if they didn't like it,
then... they didn't like it.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.002
We loved it.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.048
- Liar!
Huh.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.963
I guess I'll just put
all this away, then.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.094
You know, maybe we could watch

11:44.225 --> 11:45.313
a movie later.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.880
Yeah.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.925
Sure, that sounds fun.

11:49.056 --> 11:49.796
Hmm.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.017
And I thought
the mindflayer

11:54.148 --> 11:56.454
would be the greatest monster
I'd encounter this week.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.154
Or the gelatinous cube.
That one was tough, too.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.684
So she just straight-up
lied to him?

12:08.815 --> 12:09.903
- Like it was nothing.
- We have to fix this.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.556
Last night was so fun,

12:11.687 --> 12:12.688
and I don't know
if you've noticed,

12:12.819 --> 12:13.907
but we don't have
a ton going on here.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.169
Yeah, I just wish
there was a way

12:15.299 --> 12:17.258
we could talk to Jay directly
and set this straight.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.955
If only there was some way
we could get a message

12:19.086 --> 12:21.001
across the celestial plane.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.615
I think I have an idea.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.750
Uh, perhaps we discuss

12:30.880 --> 12:33.448
whatever it is you...
wanted to talk about.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.625
Well, well, the truth is,
is it's quite personal,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.367
and I've been keeping
a secret from you

12:39.497 --> 12:42.718
for, oh, 250 years.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.372
Oh?
I'm just
really nervous

12:44.502 --> 12:45.808
about how you're gonna take it.

12:45.939 --> 12:46.896
Well, I...

12:47.027 --> 12:48.985
think I might take it...

12:49.116 --> 12:51.074
just fine.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.989
Really?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.599
Oh.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.124
All right, here it goes.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.386
Nigel?

12:58.516 --> 13:00.344
Yes, Isaac?

13:00.475 --> 13:02.999
I killed you.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.002
Excuse me?!

13:11.442 --> 13:13.314
Hello, Officer.

13:18.972 --> 13:19.929
Oh, boy.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.670
Are you telling me

13:21.801 --> 13:24.455
the cowardly sniper
that took my life was you?

13:24.586 --> 13:27.545
Well, th-that was not at all
my intention.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.852
To have murdered in cold blood

13:29.983 --> 13:31.462
a fellow officer!

13:31.593 --> 13:32.507
My hope was to apologize.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.901
I've had enough of this.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.250
Uh...

13:36.380 --> 13:37.425
Baxter?

13:39.079 --> 13:41.429
Oh, God.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.740
All right, no Sam in sight.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.307
Hurry up and do your thing.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.190
Just a little
faster, buddy.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.669
I think Jay's
rinsing off.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.680
Lied about what?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.857
Seriously, dude,
this is gonna kill me.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.249
We've come too far, man.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.642
Fine.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.432
Hey, babe.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.086
Got a better
Internet connection,

14:30.217 --> 14:32.567
so now I can play D&D
with my boys in the city.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.656
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, and even better,

14:34.786 --> 14:36.701
one of the guys
had to drop out,

14:36.832 --> 14:38.355
so there's room for you

14:38.486 --> 14:39.574
to join permanently.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.055
- No way.
- Super cool, huh?

14:42.185 --> 14:43.839
'Cause I know how much
you love playing the game,

14:43.970 --> 14:46.886
because that's what you told me.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.367
I know you lied!

14:50.498 --> 14:52.369
- But how? No, I didn't!
- Uh-huh!

14:52.500 --> 14:54.023
The ghosts told me.
And it was genuinely haunting.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.807
I was in the shower, I was nude,

14:55.938 --> 14:57.592
and then letters just appeared
in the steam!

14:57.722 --> 14:59.376
- Trevor.
- The ghost

14:59.507 --> 15:01.291
without pants
is watching me shower?

15:01.422 --> 15:02.466
Gotta love that.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.599
Sam, why did you lie to me?

15:04.729 --> 15:06.601
I wanted to help you play
with the ghosts,

15:06.731 --> 15:08.472
but I really don't like
your favorite game.

15:08.603 --> 15:09.996
Why didn't you
just tell me?

15:10.126 --> 15:11.606
Because I didn't want
to upset you.

15:11.736 --> 15:14.348
And it just seemed easier
- to blame the ghosts.
- I don't care

15:14.478 --> 15:16.306
if you like playing the game
or not, okay?

15:16.437 --> 15:18.308
Objectively, you should,
because it's awesome.

15:18.439 --> 15:21.007
But honestly,
I just miss my friends.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.313
I know.
And you have
this whole group of people

15:23.444 --> 15:25.489
that-that you can talk to
that I can't even see.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.665
So the other night when
we were all playing together,

15:27.796 --> 15:29.841
I actually felt like
I was part of the gang.

15:31.408 --> 15:34.324
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

15:34.455 --> 15:35.847
I do hear you.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.332
So I guess things with Nigel
didn't go so great, huh?

15:42.463 --> 15:44.421
No, Sam, they didn't.

15:44.552 --> 15:49.339
It has come to my attention
that I, an officer

15:49.470 --> 15:50.384
in His Majesty's
Armed Forces,

15:50.514 --> 15:52.212
was murdered

15:52.342 --> 15:55.476
by the shameful American
war criminal Isaac Higgintoot.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.131
Wait, that was the secret?

15:58.261 --> 16:00.437
This horrifying breach of
decorum shall not go unpunished.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.265
We are taking the house.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.180
Well...

16:04.311 --> 16:08.271
if you insist that the time
for words has passed--

16:08.402 --> 16:09.664
just coming through--

16:09.794 --> 16:14.190
then, no matter the cost
in blood or treasure,

16:14.321 --> 16:19.108
my army and I will defend
this house to the bitter end.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.373
If it's war you want...

16:23.504 --> 16:25.723
then war you shall have.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.899
So be it.

16:28.030 --> 16:28.988
It's time for battle!

16:30.815 --> 16:31.729
Oh!

16:34.819 --> 16:36.343
Get out of here.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.650
- This is the war?
- I'm a pacifist,

16:39.781 --> 16:42.001
but even I would like to see
a little more action.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.526
Oh! Damn this
impotent existence!

16:45.656 --> 16:47.658
If I was alive,
I would wipe you and your boys

16:47.789 --> 16:49.138
off the face of the earth.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.748
No, you wouldn't.
You'd shoot me in the chest

16:50.879 --> 16:51.836
while I was reading my poems!

16:51.967 --> 16:54.448
Oh, wait. You already did that.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.710
Well.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.494
If we can't fight,

16:57.625 --> 17:00.236
then how the hell do we resolve
this invasion, hmm?

17:00.367 --> 17:04.284
If only there were some way
to simulate actual combat.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.764
What?

17:08.244 --> 17:10.464
Damn it,
I may have the solution.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.120
Okay, I don't really understand
what's happening here,

17:14.250 --> 17:15.947
but I'd just like to say
for the record,

17:16.078 --> 17:19.212
I am happy to solve all
future ghost conflicts this way.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.518
Okay, Pete,
you are now face-to-face with--

17:21.649 --> 17:23.042
- who's that guy?
- Oh, Jenkins.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.217
That's one of the
British ghosts.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.957
Okay, you find yourself
face-to-face

17:26.088 --> 17:27.959
with Jenkins' tiefling bard.

17:28.090 --> 17:31.093
Okay. Well,
then I unsheathe my moonblade

17:31.224 --> 17:33.617
and whisper the phrase
"swift defeat to my enemies,"

17:33.748 --> 17:35.880
thus marking him as a sworn
enemy, and giving myself

17:36.011 --> 17:37.795
an extra 3d6 damage.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.841
Gadzooks, this
is boring.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.538
Why would anyone play this?

17:41.669 --> 17:43.323
Okay. This is silly.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.107
Nigel,

17:45.238 --> 17:47.544
my killing you
was an accident,

17:47.675 --> 17:49.633
but not telling you about it
for the last two centuries,

17:49.764 --> 17:51.722
that was just plain wrong.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.899
And for that I'm truly sorry.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.555
Why didn't you
just say something?

17:58.686 --> 18:00.818
I-I was afraid you'd be mad.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.255
Oh...

18:02.385 --> 18:04.474
Isaac and the British commander
are making up.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.650
Aw, that's nice.
What did Isaac do?

18:06.781 --> 18:09.697
- He murdered him.
- Ooh, that is hard
to bounce back from.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.569
I can see why that might be
a hard subject to broach, but...

18:12.700 --> 18:15.616
how does one
even accidentally shoot another?

18:15.746 --> 18:16.965
Well...

18:17.096 --> 18:21.100
I-I was really intending
to spy on you-ur camp,

18:21.230 --> 18:24.233
using a musket looking glass
that I had invented.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.931
Some people are calling it
the "Eyesaac."

18:27.062 --> 18:28.498
Like your name?
But with...

18:28.629 --> 18:29.630
E-Y-E at the beginning?

18:29.760 --> 18:32.633
- Yes. How did you know?
- Well,

18:32.763 --> 18:33.764
what else would it be?

18:33.895 --> 18:35.375
Simply brilliant.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.246
I love it.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.682
I mean...

18:38.813 --> 18:40.554
for an instrument of my demise.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.251
And I love you...

18:43.774 --> 18:44.862
...loving it.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.647
I love you loving it.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.954
We shall consider the matter
water under the bridge.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.522
The invasion is cancelled.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.742
- But we can keep playing, right?
- Yeah. Mama has
a fourth-level spell slot

18:54.872 --> 18:56.352
she's itching to use.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.397
Thank you

18:57.527 --> 18:59.355
for your gracious hospitality.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.271
Until we next parley.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.839
Baxter?

19:09.365 --> 19:10.366
A-About that,

19:10.497 --> 19:12.803
maybe it would help
keep the peace

19:12.934 --> 19:14.675
if we, um...

19:14.805 --> 19:16.416
parleyed more often.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.114
Interesting.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.943
Perhaps, say, we could walk
the grounds sometime

19:22.073 --> 19:23.988
to discuss the peace...

19:24.119 --> 19:26.339
among other matters.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.298
I'm... actually not...

19:29.429 --> 19:31.170
doing anything right now.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.823
Oh, uh, s...

19:32.954 --> 19:34.303
splendid.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.478
To the grounds.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.398
Uh, as you were, Baxter.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.445
Stand down.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.581
Okey dokey, conflict resolved.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.453
Cool. All right, well, I guess
we're done playing, then.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.325
No. Jay, D&D is not
one of those games

19:56.456 --> 19:58.371
that's just done
in an hour.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.373
It's a rich,
multi-chaptered campaign.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.418
It could last
for months.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.593
Are you serious?

20:03.724 --> 20:04.812
Do you really want
to keep playing?

20:04.942 --> 20:06.248
No.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.902
But I will, for you.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.382
Aw.

20:09.512 --> 20:10.948
Good. 'Cause I joined
that book club

20:11.079 --> 20:12.036
last year for you.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.560
All right,
let's roll for initiative!

20:15.214 --> 20:16.302
All right!20!

20:27.356 --> 20:29.402
Come on.
Guys, we're not doing this.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.534
This is not the new system.

20:31.665 --> 20:32.666
I really want to smell
some pepperoni.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.407
There is no way
that I'm writing "pepperoni."

20:34.537 --> 20:35.451
Seriously,

20:35.582 --> 20:36.800
this is super creepy!

20:36.931 --> 20:38.324
Are you guys

20:38.454 --> 20:40.369
still in here?
Please leave.
