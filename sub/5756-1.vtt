WELL, WE'VE KIND OF
LOST TOUCH, EMILY,
REMEMBER?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.944
THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.983
I SAW A POSTER
OF ALISON YESTERDAY.

11:58.985 --> 11:59.984
IT'S AWFUL.

11:59.986 --> 12:05.356
I MEAN, WE ALL
KNOW SHE'S DEAD, RIGHT?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.325
( school bell rings )

12:07.327 --> 12:08.193
I JUST NEVER HEARD
ANYONE SAY IT.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.632
SO, I HEAR THE NEW
TEACHER'S REALLY HOT.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.344
IS THAT HANNA?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.513
SHE'S THE "IT" GIRL NOW.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.650
AND WHERE THERE'S HANNA,
THERE'S MONA.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.985
<i> THAT'S</i> MONA?

12:33.987 --> 12:35.320
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.088
WOW. TALK ABOUT A MAKEOVER.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.061
WHAT'S UP WITH HER?

12:43.063 --> 12:44.896
YOU TWO FIGHTING?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.831
WE DIDN'T JUST
FALL OUT OF TOUCH
WITH<i> YOU,</i> ARIA.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.566
WE ALL FELL OUT OF TOUCH
WITH EACH OTHER.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.305
THEY'RE NOT SO CLOSE
ANYMORE EITHER.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.041
SO THEY'RE FRIENDLY,
BUT NOT FRIENDS.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.710
( school bell rings )

13:08.755 --> 13:09.721
( sighs )

13:11.224 --> 13:12.390
HOLY CRAP.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.636
( cell phone rings )

13:30.944 --> 13:33.044
SORRY.

13:33.046 --> 13:36.681
UH, I'M MR. FITZ,
YOUR NEW ENGLISH TEACHER.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.497
ALISON?

14:04.945 --> 14:07.545
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY SOLD THE HOUSE.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.948
JUST TOO MANY MEMORIES
FOR THE DiLAURENTISES.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.850
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.185
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD
TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE
LIVING IN ALISON'S HOUSE.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.954
I KNOW, HONEY.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.056
ARIA'S BACK.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.891
DOES SHE STILL HAVE
THAT PINK HAIR?

14:19.893 --> 14:22.727
NO, MOM, SHE DOESN'T.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.330
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD
THAT FAMILY.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.999
WHY WOULD A MOTHER
LET HER DAUGHTER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

14:28.001 --> 14:31.569
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
THEIR KIDS ARE THEIR EQUALS,
NOT THEIR PROPERTY.

14:31.571 --> 14:35.540
HONEY, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE MY PROPERTY,
BUT I'M YOUR<i> MOM.</i>

14:35.542 --> 14:37.208
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER
WOULD I BE IF I LET YOU

14:37.210 --> 14:39.210
RUN AROUND
LOOKING LIKE A GOTH?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.946
THAT KIND OF LIFESTYLE
MIGHT FLY IN EUROPE,

14:41.948 --> 14:45.116
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA GET YOU
VERY FAR HERE IN ROSEWOOD.

14:45.118 --> 14:48.353
NOT EVERYONE
DREAMS OF MAKING IT
IN ROSEWOOD, MOM.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.454
OH?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.358
SOME PEOPLE DREAM
OF MAKING IT<i> OUT.</i>

15:15.315 --> 15:17.348
YOU WANT THAT?

15:17.350 --> 15:21.019
MAYA ST. GERMAIN,
A.K.A. NEW GIRL.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.420
I'M EMILY.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.988
WELCOME
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.423
THANK YOU.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.393
MMM. FOIE GRAS
AND CORNICHONS.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.694
MY FAVORITES.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.629
IT'S FROM MY MOTHER.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.031
I FIGURED.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.099
OH, THAT STUFF
WAS IN MY ROOM.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.468
YOU CAN HAVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.103
IT ALL BELONGED TO ALISON.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.471
IS SHE A FRIEND OF YOURS?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.607
SHE WAS,
A LONG TIME AGO.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.610
THAT'S ALL I GET?
NO DETAILS?

15:45.612 --> 15:49.414
UH, THERE WERE FIVE OF US
WHO USED TO HANG OUT, BUT...

15:49.416 --> 15:50.982
WE DON'T ANYMORE.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.418
WOULD IT BE OUTRAGEOUS
OF ME TO ASK

15:53.420 --> 15:55.553
IF YOU'LL HELP WITH OUR
LAST FEW BOXES?

15:55.555 --> 15:56.487
YES.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.724
BUT I DON'T MIND.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.292
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ DON'T YOU ¶</i>

16:01.294 --> 16:03.361
<i> ¶ DON'T YOU WANNA REALLY ¶</i>

16:03.363 --> 16:04.762
<i> ¶ DON'T YOU ¶</i>

16:04.764 --> 16:06.764
SO, WHY AREN'T YOU
STILL FRIENDS

16:06.766 --> 16:08.933
WITH THE GIRL
WHO USED TO LIVE HERE?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.935
YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.371
HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET TO KNOW YOU?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.073
THERE YOU GO.
ANOTHER QUESTION.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.075
FINE. YOUR TURN.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.209
ASK ME ANYTHING.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.081
IS THIS YOUR BOYFRIEND?

16:23.083 --> 16:24.449
HIS NAME IS JUSTIN.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.883
HE'S CUTE.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.919
HE'S ALSO 3,000 MILES AWAY.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.723
MY BOYFRIEND'S NAME
IS BEN.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.625
WHAT'S HE LIKE?
HE'S A SWIMMER, LIKE ME.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.062
I BET YOU'RE GOOD.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.864
YOU<i> TOTALLY</i> HAVE THE BODY.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.766
( earthmover beeping )

16:41.768 --> 16:43.768
MY MOM'S A CELLIST.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.803
THEY'RE BUILDING A STUDIO.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.972
DO YOU PLAY?
YEAH.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.941
BUT NOT THE CELLO.

16:49.943 --> 16:51.009
( both chuckle softly )

16:51.011 --> 16:52.577
IF YOU'RE A BIG JOCK,

16:52.579 --> 16:56.014
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'D
KILL ME IF I SMOKED
A LITTLE WEED?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.515
NOW?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.951
I WON'T IF YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.953
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?

17:01.955 --> 17:02.987
RELAX.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.989
THEY'RE OUT.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.024
GO AHEAD.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.464
YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

17:15.902 --> 17:16.834
OKAY.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.806
FIRST TIME?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.007
NO.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.013
YES.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.448
SO I'M CORRUPTING YOU.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.651
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.688
YEAH.
I THINK I AM.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.092
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:41.094 --> 17:43.928
YOU HAVE AN EYE FOR DESIGN.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.997
THANK YOU.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.766
HONESTLY, WHEN MOM SAID
YOU WERE CONVERTING
THE BARN TO A LOFT,

17:48.768 --> 17:51.335
I COULDN'T SEE IT,
BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.937
JOB WELL DONE.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.605
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.141
AND I TOTALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR LETTING US MOVE IN.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.110
WHAT?

17:59.112 --> 18:02.647
REN AND I ARE STAYING
IN THE BARN WHILE WE REDO
MY PLACE IN THE CITY.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.249
I'M MOVING IN
FOR JUNIOR YEAR, MELISSA.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.251
THAT'S THE DEAL THAT
I MADE WITH MOM AND DAD.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.320
I GOT THE GRADES,
I DID THE INTERNSHIP,

18:09.322 --> 18:11.522
I GAVE UP MY SUMMER
BECAUSE I<i> WANTED</i> THIS.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.125
WELL, YOU'LL
JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.993
WHY CAN'T YOU STAY
IN MY ROOM?

18:15.995 --> 18:17.595
WE'RE A COUPLE, SPENCER.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.498
WE NEED OUR OWN SPACE,
AND MOM AND DAD AGREE.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.532
BUT THEY PROMISED ME.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.268
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

18:26.706 --> 18:27.638
I'M REN.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.109
I WAS HOPING YOU'D BE
HAPPY FOR ME.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.613
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT HOPE.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.048
BREEDS ETERNAL MISERY.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.321
SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS
COUNTING ON MOVING
INTO THE BARN.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.223
DON'T WORRY ABOUT SPENCER.
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.135
SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW BETTER?

18:57.137 --> 18:59.170
I MEAN, YOU ARE
A MED STUDENT, RIGHT?

18:59.172 --> 19:01.772
YOU'RE A BIT
OF A SMART-ASS.

19:01.774 --> 19:02.874
A BIT?

19:04.210 --> 19:06.844
DOES MY SISTER
KNOW YOU SMOKE?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.846
DOES SHE HAVE
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.852
I'M SORRY THAT WE'RE
MOVING INTO YOUR LOFT.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.454
IF YOU WANT ME
TO SAY SOMETHING.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.790
IT WOULDN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.292
THANK YOU FOR BEING SORRY.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.833
YOU'RE NOT LIKE MELISSA'S
USUAL BOYFRIENDS.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.434
HOW AM I UNUSUAL?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.638
WE'RE LATE FOR DINNER.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.277
I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.313
THAT'S WHAT'S UNUSUAL.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.912
YOU TOLD ME
YOU WENT TO HOLLIS.

20:14.914 --> 20:19.083
NO. I SAID I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MAJORING IN ENGLISH.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.719
AND THAT'S TRUE.

20:21.721 --> 20:26.524
LOOK, I THINK
YOU'RE AMAZING, ARIA.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.726
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
I THOUGHT...

20:28.728 --> 20:30.027
"WHO IS THIS GIRL?"

20:40.106 --> 20:43.574
I'M STILL THAT GIRL.
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.711
YES. YES, IT HAS.
I'M YOUR TEACHER.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.080
I KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ME.

20:49.082 --> 20:52.183
YOU-- YOU FEEL LIKE
THIS IS RIGHT FOR US TOO.

20:52.185 --> 20:53.484
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.021
WE JUST CAN'T.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.768
( giggling )
THANKS FOR WALKING ME HOME.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.169
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.038
PRACTICE DOESN'T START
UNTIL FOUR.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.074
I'VE NEVER HAD
A JOCK FRIEND BEFORE.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.777
I GUESS THAT
MAKES YOU MY FIRST.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.078
( loud thud )

21:28.187 --> 21:29.520
ARE YOU OKAY?

21:30.990 --> 21:33.391
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO TALK ABOUT.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.227
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GIRL
WHO USED TO LIVE HERE.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.361
ALISON.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.363
SHE DISAPPEARED LAST SUMMER.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.831
SHE'S STILL MISSING.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.567
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
<i> AWFUL</i> FOR YOU.

21:43.569 --> 21:47.071
I USED TO THINK
IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT HER,
I WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT HER.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.440
BUT YOU STILL DO.
YEAH.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.175
I'M SORRY.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.082
( giggles )

22:00.620 --> 22:02.253
SEE YOU TOMORROW?

22:02.255 --> 22:04.188
YEAH. BYE.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.442
HEY, YOU BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH ARIA?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.210
NOT REALLY.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.757
EMILY.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.127
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

22:43.129 --> 22:44.428
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.240
( door closes )

22:58.711 --> 23:00.478
PERFECT TIME
FOR A JACUZZI.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.279
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WEREN'T MOVING IN
TILL NEXT WEEK.

23:02.281 --> 23:06.384
MELISSA WANTED TO GET SETTLED
BEFORE CLASSES START.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.086
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE A TOWEL, WOULD YOU?

23:20.466 --> 23:22.099
TOUGH DAY AT SCHOOL.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.101
TOUGH FIELD HOCKEY
PRACTICE.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.137
I ROWED FOR OXFORD.

23:26.139 --> 23:28.305
THAT LOOKS GOOD
ON A MED SCHOOL APP.

23:28.307 --> 23:31.308
I DID IT
'CAUSE I LOVED IT.

23:31.310 --> 23:32.643
MM.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.714
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A FLUID BUILDUP
IN YOUR BURSA SAC.

23:36.716 --> 23:40.117
I BET YOU SAY THAT
TO ALL THE GIRLS.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.152
I CAN HELP.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.387
OKAY...

23:43.389 --> 23:44.488
DR. REN.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.463
THAT'S AWESOME.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.237
( softly )
Is that all right?

24:02.175 --> 24:03.073
Melissa: REN?

24:13.352 --> 24:15.352
WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO?

24:15.354 --> 24:16.821
NO ONE.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.230
FOUND THEM.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.174
LOOK WHAT ELSE I FOUND.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.411
OHH. SHE USED TO
DRAG THAT THING EVERYWHERE.

24:40.413 --> 24:42.246
( chuckles )

24:42.248 --> 24:43.981
I THINK YOU'RE HAPPY
TO BE BACK.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.182
AREN'T YOU?

24:45.184 --> 24:47.318
WELL, HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.321
OHH. YOU AND ARIA
ARE SO MUCH ALIKE.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.923
I DON'T THINK SHE'S HAPPY
TO BE HOME EITHER.

24:52.925 --> 24:57.428
I KNOW IT WAS LIKE
A VACATION FROM OUR
REAL LIFE, BUT...

24:57.430 --> 24:59.597
I FELT LIKE WE REALLY
BONDED WHEN WE WERE AWAY.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.433
WELL, WE<i> HAD</i> TO CONNECT.
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE.

25:02.435 --> 25:04.168
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.670
ARE YOU REALLY WORRIED
THAT WE WILL?

25:08.374 --> 25:10.274
IT'S JUST EASY FOR
STUFF TO GET IN THE WAY.

25:12.879 --> 25:15.079
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.081
OHH...

25:17.083 --> 25:20.117
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
SURPRISED THAT SHE
BROUGHT THAT WITH US.

25:20.119 --> 25:23.654
WELL, SHE LOVES IT
BECAUSE YOU GAVE IT TO HER.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.856
WHAT KIND OF STUFF
COULD GET IN THE WAY OF US?

25:25.858 --> 25:28.092
NO, NOTHING, NOTHING.
YOU KNOW ME.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.195
I JUST GET A LITTLE
OVERLY OBSESSED ABOUT
WORK, THAT'S ALL.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.863
HM.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.165
WE'RE GOOD, ELLA.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.800
COME HERE.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.269
MM. IT'S ALL GOOD.

25:41.073 --> 25:44.108
OH, I DROVE PAST
ALISON'S HOUSE TODAY.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.343
IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T MISSED.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.145
OH, GOD. A YEAR LATER.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.814
IMAGINE WHAT THAT POOR
FAMILY IS GOING THROUGH.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.816
I CAN'T. I DON'T EVER
WANT TO IMAGINE.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.685
IF<i> ANYTHING</i>
EVER HAPPENED TO YOU--

25:54.687 --> 25:56.320
NOTHING IS GONNA HAPPEN.

25:56.322 --> 26:00.124
WE ARE SAFE. WE'RE TOGETHER.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.359
AND WE'RE HOME.

26:02.361 --> 26:05.296
Male Vocalist:

26:15.274 --> 26:18.475
( Melissa and Ren
giggling )

26:18.477 --> 26:20.611
( indistinct conversation )

26:30.256 --> 26:32.790
( indistinct conversation
and laughter )

27:18.137 --> 27:20.537
ARE YOU GONNA
EAT THAT, SWEETIE?

27:20.539 --> 27:22.373
I'M BEING A FRIEND, HANNA.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.175
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT ALISON'S?
HI, GIRLS!

27:25.177 --> 27:26.410
HI, IAN.
YOU STILL NEED HELP
WITH YOUR SCOOP, SPENCE?

27:26.412 --> 27:28.045
I'VE GOT MY STICK
IN THE CAR.

27:28.047 --> 27:31.982
IAN, WHAT ARE YOU,
HER BABYSITTER?

27:31.984 --> 27:33.484
YOU NEED
TO TELL YOUR SISTER.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.152
TELL ME WHAT?

27:38.324 --> 27:39.823
NOTHING.

27:39.825 --> 27:40.924
COME ON.

27:44.563 --> 27:46.196
OUTSIDE.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.405
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

27:54.407 --> 27:56.073
SHE'S GONNA FIND OUT.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.174
NO, SHE'S NOT.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.476
I PROMISE YOU, SHE IS,

27:59.478 --> 28:02.646
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
TELL HER, I WILL.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.314
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

28:04.316 --> 28:07.685
DON'T YOU GET IT?
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU
DO THE RIGHT THING.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.319
IT WAS<i> ONE</i> KISS.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.056
NOW, YOU LISTEN
TO ME, ALISON.
OR WHAT?

28:12.058 --> 28:16.226
IF YOU SAY ONE WORD
TO MY SISTER ABOUT IAN,

28:16.228 --> 28:18.896
I WILL TELL EVERYONE
THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE JENNA THING.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.262
ALISON?

28:57.303 --> 28:59.536
I'M SORRY
FOR JUST STOPPING BY.

28:59.538 --> 29:02.840
NO. ANY TIME, EM.
COME ON, YOU KNOW THAT.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.178
SOMEBODY LEFT A NOTE
IN MY LOCKER.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.348
FROM "A"?
YOU TOO?

29:11.350 --> 29:14.184
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S HER?
IS IT POSSIBLE?

29:14.186 --> 29:16.186
ONLY ALISON
COULD HAVE KNOWN.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.721
WHAT? KNOWN-- KNOWN WHAT?

29:20.159 --> 29:21.558
IT WAS...

29:21.560 --> 29:23.293
PERSONAL?

29:23.295 --> 29:25.996
I REALLY BELIEVED
SHE WAS DEAD.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.532
YEAH. YEAH, WE ALL DID.

29:28.534 --> 29:29.767
COULD SHE REALLY BE BACK?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.369
I THINK SHE'S
PLAYING WITH US.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.104
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

29:34.106 --> 29:36.273
IT'S ALISON THAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT HERE.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.342
I MEAN, WASN'T THAT
HER FAVORITE SPORT?

29:38.344 --> 29:40.177
SHOULD WE TELL SOMEONE?

29:42.715 --> 29:44.081
I DON'T...

29:44.083 --> 29:46.350
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, BUT...

29:46.352 --> 29:48.018
I CAN'T.

29:52.591 --> 29:53.991
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.262
IT'S FUNNY...

29:58.264 --> 30:01.598
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH
I GREW UP HERE,

30:01.600 --> 30:03.534
I FEEL LIKE
A TOTAL OUTSIDER.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.436
ME TOO.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.948
I RAN INTO ELLA
MONTGOMERY TODAY.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.952
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ARIA WAS BACK?

30:21.954 --> 30:24.421
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.223
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR FATHER LEFT.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.227
I<i> HATE</i> TELLING THAT STORY.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.629
SO CHANGE THE STORY.
I DID.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.064
( soft chuckle )

30:34.066 --> 30:36.300
YOU GREW UP.
YOU GREW APART.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.268
IT WAS MUTUAL,
AND, HONESTLY,

30:38.270 --> 30:40.103
WE ARE MUCH HAPPIER
WITHOUT HIM.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.638
HANNA.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.640
SAY IT ENOUGH,
AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY
START TO BELIEVE IT.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.812
WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT DOES SOUND A LOT
BETTER THAN THE TRUTH.

30:48.814 --> 30:50.614
NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT WE GOT DUMPED.

30:52.251 --> 30:55.118
"WE" DIDN'T GET DUMPED.
I DID.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.453
HE LEFT BOTH OF US.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.821
( cell phone rings )

30:59.225 --> 31:01.325
IF THAT'S MONA,
I'M STAGING AN INTERVENTION.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.295
HANNA.
IT'S DINNERTIME.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.932
( cell phone rings )

31:10.402 --> 31:11.468
IT'S ASHLEY.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.272
( doorbell chimes )

31:16.842 --> 31:19.209
YES, I LEFT IT
ON YOUR DESK. MM-HMM.

31:25.684 --> 31:26.917
HANNA MARIN?

31:26.919 --> 31:28.352
YEAH. WHY?

31:28.354 --> 31:29.953
IS YOUR MOTHER HOME?

31:31.724 --> 31:33.490
LET ME CALL YOU BACK.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.359
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

31:35.361 --> 31:37.694
WE RECEIVED A CALL
FROM ROSEWOOD MALL
SECURITY.

31:37.696 --> 31:39.296
THEY HAVE
YOUR DAUGHTER ON TAPE

31:39.298 --> 31:41.131
SHOPLIFTING
A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.903
I'M SURE THERE'S BEEN
A MISTAKE.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.406
I DON'T THINK SO.
COULD YOU TURN AROUND?

31:54.113 --> 31:55.445
( softly )
Mom.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.243
( cell phone rings )

32:54.373 --> 32:56.807
WHAT'S GOING ON?
LET'S GO.

32:56.809 --> 32:57.774
REALLY?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.278
( sirens wail )

33:13.225 --> 33:14.858
IN A SMALL TOWN LIKE THIS,

33:14.860 --> 33:17.027
WHAT PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT YOU MATTERS.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.029
( softly )
I know.

33:19.031 --> 33:22.366
THEN WHY WOULD YOU
RISK IT ALL TO STEAL
A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES?

33:22.368 --> 33:25.002
HANNA, I BUY YOU
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO BE POPULAR.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.370
THAT'S NOT WHY I DO IT.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.271
THEN WHY DO--? THIS IS
SOMETHING YOU<i> DO?</i>

33:30.075 --> 33:31.208
A FEW TIMES.

33:33.278 --> 33:35.545
THIS IS ABOUT YOUR FATHER,
ISN'T IT?

33:37.449 --> 33:39.683
YOU THINK THIS IS GOING
TO GET HIS ATTENTION.

33:43.055 --> 33:45.055
I MADE A MISTAKE.

33:45.057 --> 33:48.859
IN ROSEWOOD, YOU DON'T HAVE
ROOM TO MAKE A MISTAKE.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.293
AND NEITHER DO I.

33:50.295 --> 33:51.228
I'M SORRY.

33:52.431 --> 33:55.298
I'LL FIX IT SOMEHOW.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.034
YOU WILL DENY
YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.370
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.438
BUT...

34:01.440 --> 34:02.873
I'M TAKING CARE OF IT.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.644
( car engine starts )

I THOUGHT SOMETHING
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.483
I TRIED TO CALL YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:46.485 --> 34:48.885
THEY FOUND YOUR FRIEND.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.754
I KNEW SHE WAS BACK.
IS SHE INSIDE?
EMILY!

34:52.858 --> 34:54.891
I'M SORRY.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.327
THEY FOUND ALISON'S BODY.

I HEARD THE COPS TOOK
HANNA TO THE POLICE

36:01.593 --> 36:03.793
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'D EVER TALK ABOUT...

36:03.795 --> 36:04.961
THE JENNA THING?

36:06.598 --> 36:08.064
WE MADE A PROMISE.

Female Reporter:
<i> CURRENT OWNERS</i>
<i> OF THE RESIDENCE</i>

36:47.940 --> 36:50.006

37:27.312 --> 37:29.813
THE DISCOVERY OF HER BODY
ROCKED THIS COMMUNITY,

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I FEEL WORSE ABOUT--

38:08.320 --> 38:09.719
HAVING TO STAY
AWAY FROM YOU

38:09.721 --> 38:11.321
OR BEING A JERK
ABOUT IT.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.761
YEAH, SHE WAS
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.496
I'M SORRY.

BOTH.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.238
THANK YOU.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.611
I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO DO ANYTHING

I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.980
I ASKED THE OTHER GIRLS
TO SIT TOGETHER UP FRONT.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.615
IT'S WHAT ALISON
WOULD HAVE WANTED.

39:45.617 --> 39:46.583
OF COURSE.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.316
POOR ALI.

40:20.318 --> 40:23.119
CAN YOU BELIEVE
WHAT A SCENE THIS IS?

40:23.121 --> 40:25.321
ALISON
WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.

40:38.470 --> 40:39.469

40:53.084 --> 40:54.484
ANYONE WE KNOW?

40:54.486 --> 40:56.619
NO, IT'S JUST MY MOM
SENDING ME A TEXT.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.659

41:36.528 --> 41:38.561
DID YOU SEE THAT
JENNA MARSHALL WAS HERE?

41:38.563 --> 41:40.597
I DIDN'T REALIZE
SHE AND ALI WERE FRIENDS.

41:40.599 --> 41:41.664
THEY WEREN'T.
