WEBVTT

00:31.031 --> 00:32.198


00:33.366 --> 00:34.576
Yup.

00:34.659 --> 00:35.827
Yup.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.203
-Mm-hm.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.455


00:38.538 --> 00:39.581
Yup.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.082
That's a good wall, Hank.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.501
Sorry again for blowing up your shed.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.295
But you knew I worked with explosives

00:45.378 --> 00:47.005
when you moved in next door.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.382
What are you gonna do? Neighbors, huh?

00:49.466 --> 00:52.302
Well, it gives me a chance
to try some new stuff.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.638
There's a lot about sheds
we didn't know 20 years ago.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.681
What in the...

00:58.141 --> 00:59.434
That was in my way.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.897
Mighty kick, Colonel.
And from such a short leg.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.108
Dangit, Dad.
I hadn't finished framing the shed yet.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.027
You call this twigloo a shed?

01:09.110 --> 01:12.655
Back in WW-deuce I built
a survival shed out of bamboo

01:12.739 --> 01:15.033
and mud, and blood, and dung.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.286
That shed withstood a direct hit
from a Tojo balloon bomb!

01:18.369 --> 01:19.829
That sounds like quite a shed!

01:20.497 --> 01:23.541
-Dad, what are you even doing here?
-In the neighborhood.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.426
Lucky. You look so handsome tonight.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.928
Thanks, baby doll.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.304
You can't tell,

01:36.387 --> 01:38.807
but the toes of my socks are gold.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.350
Oh.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.561
I don't see why I can't go to dinner
with you guys.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.940
I'm the only one in this family
who likes to dress nice.

01:47.023 --> 01:51.486
Because we are going to
a fancy restaurant, that is not for kids.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.987
It's called Tokyaki!

01:53.071 --> 01:55.240
And they cook the food
right on your table!

01:55.323 --> 01:59.077
And there's fire, and dancing,
and juggling of knives.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.246
But I love all those things!

02:01.329 --> 02:03.373
No, Bobby. It's not for you.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.917
They flip the shrimps
right into your mouth.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.710
You catch the shrimp in your mouth?

02:07.794 --> 02:08.962
Like Scooby-Doo?

02:09.045 --> 02:12.966
Yes, Bobby. Like Scooby-Doo, for adults.

02:16.469 --> 02:20.640
Well, I hope you have a wonderful night
because now I won't.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.642
Good-bye, forever.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.561
Oh, I can't believe this.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.479
Bobby's babysitter just canceled.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.022
Yes!

02:28.106 --> 02:29.732
Somebody make me some toast.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.652
Don't care who. Do care sourdough.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.864
Perfect. We don't have a babysitter.
I can't go to dinner.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.073
And now he's here.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.742
Sounds like you are a woman after all,
Hank's wife,

02:39.826 --> 02:42.537
talking about problems,
offering no fixings.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.665
I guess I'll have to spoon-feed
this to you.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.500
I'll watch the boy.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.502
You'll hang out tonight, Ging-Ging?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.171
You bet, Bing-Bing.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.089
Oh, well, thanks, Dad.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.134
We cannot leave Cotton alone with Bobby.
Ah-ah.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.720
-Why not?
-Think about your childhood.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.764
Yeah, you've got a point.

03:01.848 --> 03:05.852
But, you know, even though he hates
most things, he does love Bobby.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.313
Ouch!

03:08.938 --> 03:12.525
Well, I do enjoy performance restaurants.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.695
There's a lasagna in the fridge.
Bobby can reach it.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.117
-You want to listen to music, Ging-Ging?
-All right.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.412
-Wanna watch me dance, Ging-Ging?
-All right.

03:24.662 --> 03:28.374
<i>♪ Don't you wish your girlfriend
was a freak like me ♪</i>

03:30.919 --> 03:32.879
Hear that, boy? I'm empty.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.466
Time to fill my gullet.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.261
<i>♪ Don't you wish your girlfriend
was raw like me ♪</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:48.102
This lasagna has gone cold.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.021
Hank's wife can't do anything right!

03:51.022 --> 03:53.816
I think you're supposed to heat it up
in the oven.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.653
Oven? I pee standing up, son!

03:56.736 --> 03:58.112
You see bumps under my shirt?

03:59.864 --> 04:01.866
So what are we gonna do for dinner?

04:01.950 --> 04:04.744
Why, that seaweed house they just went
to sounded good.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.496
But how are we gonna get there?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.665
You're not supposed to drive anymore.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.333
We'll see who can't...

04:10.416 --> 04:13.002
...drive their grandson
at night without glasses or a license,

04:13.086 --> 04:15.046
using a mop to press the pedals.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.047
Let's go!

04:26.849 --> 04:29.269
Why do they call that an onion volcano...

04:29.352 --> 04:31.062
Oh, my Lord!

04:32.689 --> 04:34.649
-Look at that.
-Wow.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.442
Well, I see a zucchini on deck.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.069
I wonder what he's gonna do with that.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.206
We're in the dragon's den, boy.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.249
Keep your guard up!

04:55.753 --> 04:58.381
What kind of internment camp is this?

04:58.464 --> 05:00.049
Dad, what are you doing here?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.175
We're hungry!

05:01.259 --> 05:03.761
But I left you lasagna in the fridge.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.555
I left it on the floor!

05:11.352 --> 05:13.896
Ooh.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.317
Hey, everybody. I'm Bobby.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.069
Well, what do we have here?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.155
A cooking Tojo.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.990
<i>Uh, que es Togo?</i>

05:24.073 --> 05:25.658
Come on, Dad. We're trying to have a...

05:25.742 --> 05:27.493
And I tried having a son
who's good enough!

05:27.577 --> 05:29.162
Now, somebody plate me!

05:33.374 --> 05:35.084
That's a bowl!

05:36.836 --> 05:39.589
He reminds of this guy I killed...

05:39.672 --> 05:41.215
Or did I?

05:53.644 --> 05:54.812
Drop your weapons!

05:54.896 --> 05:57.857
Dad, relax. That's just salt and pepper.
Now, sit down.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.527
Those are Tojo whomping sticks, boy!
Drop them now!

06:02.362 --> 06:04.238
Hank, control your father.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.156
Dangit, Dad!

06:05.239 --> 06:08.534
You're ruining at least four birthdays
and a graduation!

06:08.618 --> 06:10.536
You should be up here protecting
your family!

06:10.620 --> 06:12.205
What's wrong with you?

06:12.997 --> 06:14.123
Dad, no!

06:15.708 --> 06:17.377
Come here, Dad. You're acting crazy.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.713
Back off! I didn't want you!
I wanted a boy!

06:20.797 --> 06:23.257
Yeah, I know. I'm a girl. Now, get down!

06:29.555 --> 06:30.473
Oh, my God!

06:31.891 --> 06:32.934
Dad!

06:37.021 --> 06:39.107
You finally got me, Tojo.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.859
I actually respect you.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.656
Well, Cotton's gonna have
quite a payday from this.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.494
"Rooby-Roo!"

06:58.167 --> 06:59.836
Tojos! Get down!

06:59.919 --> 07:01.921
Stinky, they're in the trees!

07:02.004 --> 07:03.756
Well, it doesn't look good.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.757
What's wrong with him?

07:05.675 --> 07:06.551
What? Are you serious?

07:07.802 --> 07:09.804
Okay. Where to begin?

07:09.887 --> 07:13.141
He has severe burns, a broken hip,
and torn ligaments

07:13.224 --> 07:16.811
in what I can only call his ankle knees,
or “ankies.”

07:16.894 --> 07:18.896
Plus, he's extremely allergic
to shellfish,

07:18.980 --> 07:21.941
which caused swelling
and an infection in the esophagus.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.943
Oh, not to mention the four rusty bullets

07:24.026 --> 07:27.071
previously lodged in his chest cavity,
one in his heart.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.198
He's been worse.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.534
Hank? How bad is it?

07:31.617 --> 07:34.829
Do they gots to put my hands on my elbows?

07:36.414 --> 07:39.750
Well, it's only a matter of hours,
maybe a day.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.752
I'm sorry, Mister Hill.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.549
Well, I've got a shed to rebuild.
See you later, Dad.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.386
This is big.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.347
I don't know how Hank
is gonna react to all this.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.224
Do you think Bobby knows?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.354
Hey! Tah-daa!

08:01.564 --> 08:04.400
No. And I don't think
he should be around for this.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.572
Hey, would you two mind watching him
until things settle down with Cotton?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.657
Of course, Aunt Peggy.

08:11.741 --> 08:15.703
This'll be a great way for Lucky
and me to practice being parents.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.205
I will play the mother.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.664
Perfect.

08:19.916 --> 08:20.833
Hey, Bobby.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.252
You're gonna come stay with us for awhile.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.420
Why?

08:24.795 --> 08:26.756
Um... Uh...

08:27.006 --> 08:28.382
I'll handle this.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.470
Bobby, there's a crazy man killing

08:32.553 --> 08:34.555
all the children in your neighborhood.

08:34.639 --> 08:38.809
So until they catch him,
you'd be in grave danger here.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.735
Colonel, I brought you some cigarettes,
girlie magazines,

08:47.818 --> 08:51.239
and the classic Bob Hope comedy tape,
"Put It There, Pal."

08:51.447 --> 08:53.908
Bob Hope, class act.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.744
Is there anything else I can get you, sir?

08:56.827 --> 08:58.329
I ain't going yet!

08:58.412 --> 08:59.872
Gots too much to do.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.167
Tojo, Shirley Temple, destroy sissy shack
Hank's building.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.004
I swear on the lives of my family,

09:07.088 --> 09:12.218
I will try my best to see what I can do
about some of those things.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.226
Hank, you want to take a break
and go visit your dad in the hospital?

09:20.309 --> 09:21.185
No.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.188
Hank, he's dying.
Don't you think you should be there?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.148
He's not dying.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.609
I don't think a shrimp
from some restaurant

09:28.693 --> 09:32.405
is gonna take down a man
the entire Japanese army couldn't.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.412
-So, you want to play Tokyaki chef?
-Absolutely.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.455
Let me go get the big knives.

09:41.789 --> 09:46.627
Um, Lucky, can I speak to you
away from Bobby, please?

09:47.712 --> 09:50.506
Well, what are we gonna do
after the Tokyaki game?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.341
We don't have anything planned!

09:52.425 --> 09:54.719
Bobby's our pretend son.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.679
We cannot mess this up!

10:02.602 --> 10:05.229
So, uh, how's your dad doing, Hank?

10:05.313 --> 10:08.107
-Well, I'm sure he's fine.
-What do you mean?

10:08.190 --> 10:10.026
Haven't you been to the hospital
to see him?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.153
I've got to finish the shed first.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.614
I'll see him in a couple of days
when he gets home.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.742
Eeh.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.660
Dale, what in the heck are you doing?

10:19.744 --> 10:23.956
I promised the colonel I'd grant him
his dying wish to destroy your shed.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.334
And from the looks of him,
I don't have much time.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.169
Wait. You went to see my dad?

10:28.252 --> 10:31.047
Maybe I should visit Cotton
and pay my respects.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.591
I'm gonna buy him a bear
that's dressed like a doctor.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.968
You guys are all overreacting.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.094
Cotton's tough.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.722
He'll be shooting at our feet
before you know it.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.808
Dang ol'...

10:42.892 --> 10:43.976
No, man.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.280
You know, uh,

10:56.364 --> 10:59.325
I guess my dad isn't, isn't doing so good.

11:00.409 --> 11:05.623
Hank, I am both surprised and amazed
by this outpour of emotion!

11:05.706 --> 11:07.416
Yeah, well, uh...

11:07.500 --> 11:09.085
You must go see him, Hank.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.380
I'm so glad you're finally coming
to terms with Cotton's dying.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.924
I have been prepared for years.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.014
What are we doing up here, Lucky?

11:22.098 --> 11:26.852
Luanne saw a cereal commercial about
how kids should be kids and have fun.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.147
And since it has all 11 essential
vitamins and minerals,

11:30.231 --> 11:31.649
we're inclined to believe it.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.858
Okay.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.819
So what's the tire for?

11:34.902 --> 11:35.778
Fun!

11:43.452 --> 11:46.372
Lucky, no! It's not safe!

11:49.166 --> 11:51.127
Okay! Now it's safe!

11:55.798 --> 11:57.425
Are you having fun?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.555
Hank?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.766
Uh, it's okay, Dad. I'm here.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.353
Honey, I don't want to put too much
pressure on this moment.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.565
But now is the time to say
whatever needs to be said,

12:12.648 --> 12:16.402
as it is the last time
you will ever speak to your father.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.408
Hank...

12:24.910 --> 12:26.954
I know I was hard on you.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.623
But it wasn't because I hate you.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.708
I know.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.380
I know we don't say it enough,
or at all, I guess.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.591
But I love you too, Dad.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.635
-You loves me?
-Dad?

12:41.719 --> 12:44.180
What kind of man tells another man
he loves him?

12:44.263 --> 12:47.349
I don't want to die with my sissy son
who "loves" me.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.894
You gonna bring me roses
because you "love" me?

12:49.977 --> 12:52.480
No! No, Dad. It's not like that.
I didn't mean...

12:52.563 --> 12:54.064
Get out of here!

12:54.148 --> 12:55.900
I can't even look at you!

12:55.983 --> 12:57.485
How dare you love me?

12:57.568 --> 12:58.694
But I don't...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.529
I don't love you!

13:05.951 --> 13:07.453
-Code blue!
-Let's move!

13:07.536 --> 13:08.579
He's got no pulse!

13:08.662 --> 13:10.956
-Charge the paddles.
-Paddles charged, 300.

13:11.040 --> 13:11.916
Clear!

13:18.214 --> 13:21.967
The last thing I said to my dad was
"I don't love you."

13:22.051 --> 13:23.677
How can I live with that?

13:23.761 --> 13:26.514
I think that was the right thing to say.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.684
I mean, the man did spend a lifetime
tormenting you.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.728
That was just his way.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.481
God! Why did I pick a fight with him
when he was dying?

13:35.564 --> 13:36.774
What's wrong with me?

13:36.857 --> 13:38.526
Cotton loved fighting.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.986
You probably made dying fun for him.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.031
Hello?

13:44.865 --> 13:46.075
I see.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.117
Thank you.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.037
He's alive.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.541
Keep shoveling coal, Bobby.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.126
We got to get to the North Pole
before nightfall

13:56.210 --> 13:58.128
and give Santa Claus his heart pills.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.964
Or Christmas will be ruined.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.132
Lucky, can I speak to you?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.553
I'm worried that we're being too easy

14:05.636 --> 14:06.470
on Bobby.

14:06.554 --> 14:12.309
I read in Jenny McCarthy's baby book that
a child needs boundaries and structure.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.645
She made Playmate four times.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.105
She knows.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.317
Bobby Hill, you are grounded, mister.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.986
What? Why?

14:22.069 --> 14:23.487
Eat your vegetables!

14:24.154 --> 14:25.739
There are no vegetables.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.783
Don't talk back to your pretend mother.

14:27.867 --> 14:32.413
We are not just fun parents.
We are also strict parents.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.083
Wash your hands.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.420
Okay, Hank.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.006
I'm coming up with the perfect last words
for you.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.799
He might not die, Peggy.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.218
Well, you should be prepared
in case he does.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.470
You're getting another chance at this,
Hank.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.306
Nobody gets another chance.

14:52.224 --> 14:57.146
"I will find out who did this to you
and kill them with my own hands!

14:57.229 --> 14:59.398
This I swear to you."

15:00.441 --> 15:02.985
Huh. I bet he'd actually like that.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.655
Dad, you're alive!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.198
I saw the Grim Reaper!

15:08.282 --> 15:10.701
And I kicked him in the stones,
and spit in his eye,

15:10.784 --> 15:12.661
and told him I ain't going yet!

15:12.745 --> 15:13.996
Well, all right, Dad.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.457
I also saw the 50 men I killed.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.250
They're up there waiting for me.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.210
And they're angry!

15:20.294 --> 15:22.338
But I also saw my shins.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.881
They looked good.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.008
So he's gonna make it?

15:26.091 --> 15:27.760
Absolutely not.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.720
Technically, I don't know
how he was revived

15:29.803 --> 15:31.889
or how on earth he's talking to us now.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.061
Hank.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.855
All this dying's got me to thinking.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.690
I might not live forever.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.151
And there's certain things
I'd like done once I pass.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.946
But, Dad, you're not gonna die ever again.

15:47.029 --> 15:52.201
I want you to cut off my head
and mail it to the Japanese emperor.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.746
Put a couple of worms in my mouth
to scare that sumbitch.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.874
Boy, are you getting all this?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.084
I got it.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.627
Dad, you're overreacting.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.296
I don't know why we're even talking
about this stuff.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.131
I'm overreacting?

16:06.215 --> 16:08.550
Well, you look like you're about to water
out your face hole!

16:08.634 --> 16:09.927
You got to go, sissy son!

16:10.010 --> 16:11.470
I got, sissy...

16:11.553 --> 16:13.389
Get out of here...

16:13.472 --> 16:14.306
Git!

16:15.349 --> 16:18.602
"We'll be on that beach again
drinking mohitos."

16:18.686 --> 16:19.603
What?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.106
Sissy!

16:26.235 --> 16:27.861
We're too hard on him.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.197
He's gonna hate us forever and rebel!

16:30.280 --> 16:32.992
We tried being tough
and we tried being soft.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.996
But we haven't tried doing both
at the same time.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.665
Bobby Hill, come here this instant!

16:41.500 --> 16:43.752
-Yeah?
-Stand up straight!

16:43.836 --> 16:46.171
Surprise! Your very own lighter!

16:47.089 --> 16:48.215
Tuck in your shirt!

16:49.216 --> 16:51.301
-Tag, you're it!
-Go to your room!

16:51.385 --> 16:52.928
I'll sneak you some pudding.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.638
-Floss!
-Marco...

16:54.722 --> 16:56.682
I can't take it anymore!

16:58.142 --> 16:59.476
Ah.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.980
We're going to be such good parents.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.030
You need anything, Dad?

17:11.739 --> 17:13.407
You're still here?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.827
I want to die alone just like I was born.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.246
My mother died sleeping in her apartment.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.414
That's right, Hank.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.790
I birthed myself.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.918
Tore myself right out of her utery!

17:25.627 --> 17:27.838
No more stories, Dad. You need to rest.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.381
It's my time to go.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.842
I successfully burned all my bridges.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.678
Nobody loves me and I don't love nobody.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.472
No. That's not true.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.765
People do love you.

17:37.848 --> 17:42.144
And, uh, these people that love you
don't want you to die.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.856
Really? Who are they?

17:47.024 --> 17:49.068
All kinds of people.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.362
People love you, Dad.
And they want to tell you...

17:53.864 --> 17:54.698
uh...

17:54.782 --> 17:56.241
before it's too late.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.578
I just, uh,... I just need you to know...

17:59.661 --> 18:00.579
Uh...

18:01.246 --> 18:03.332
Uh...

18:03.415 --> 18:04.291
Dad?

18:10.380 --> 18:11.256
You finished?

18:12.466 --> 18:13.300
You died.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.719
I learned to slow my heart rate
to near death,

18:15.803 --> 18:18.847
so the Tojos would stop torturing me
for a second.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.934
And I couldn't stand the torture
of hearing your baby-crying

18:22.017 --> 18:24.186
about your daddy dying!

18:26.563 --> 18:28.524
I'm not crying. It's just...

18:29.066 --> 18:30.609
I got to get out of here.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.949
-Is he...
-He won't...

18:37.032 --> 18:38.575
I can't...

18:39.660 --> 18:41.328
Everything is gonna be okay.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.915
Why don't you go get a soda
or go splash some water on your face?

18:48.836 --> 18:50.295
It's okay.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.588
I'm here.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.006
You can go now.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.885
Go, go into the light.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.846
The light is good.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.515
You can just let go now.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.854
Mister Reaper, I'd prefer it
if you put your hood back on.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.522
Why won't you die?

19:08.605 --> 19:11.066
This was supposed to happen to you!

19:11.150 --> 19:12.401
You're worthless!

19:12.484 --> 19:17.239
You're not even good enough to be married
to my worthless nothing of a loser son!

19:17.322 --> 19:22.494
Enough! Your son has always loved you
despite your constant torture.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.872
You want to die alone? Fine.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.457
You want to keep coming back
and never die?

19:27.541 --> 19:29.001
That's fine too.

19:29.084 --> 19:32.296
In fact, I hope you do go on living
forever

19:32.379 --> 19:37.718
as the unhappy person you are in the hell
you have created here on earth.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.928
I hope you live forever.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.847
I really do.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.056
Do you now?

19:53.650 --> 19:55.527
Hank, I'm sorry. He's gone.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.698
Are you sure?

20:02.993 --> 20:05.245
Yes. He has moved on.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.498
-I should have been here.
-No. No, you shouldn't have.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.668
I mean, he told me
what he wasn't able to tell you.

20:11.752 --> 20:15.422
That is, he said to tell you he loved you.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.132
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.344
Yes. He said he was sorry
for the way he treated you

20:20.427 --> 20:23.472
and for being unable to tell you himself.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.808
Okay.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.770
Well, you got your shins back.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.524
I don't want to cut off his head, Peggy.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.444
Oh. He also said he changed his mind
about that.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.961
It's a really good shed, Hank.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.589
Yeah, man. It's like a dang ol'
tribute, man.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.507
Yup.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.973
I guess it was a sissy shack after all.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.600
That was for you, Colonel! Woo!

21:10.018 --> 21:12.271
So long, sissy shack!

21:12.354 --> 21:13.647
Woo!

21:51.351 --> 21:54.021
-<i>You finally got me, Tojo.</i>
