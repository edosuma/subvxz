ANDY: Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.422
The reason I came by
is because I wanted to apologize

00:05.588 --> 00:07.716
for what I said to you
in Baldwin earlier. (EXHALES)

00:07.924 --> 00:08.925
Don’t worry about it.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.261
No, it wasn’t professional,
because the truth is,

00:11.386 --> 00:14.764
I... I wasn’t feeling
entirely professional.

00:15.473 --> 00:18.810
(INHALES) Listen, tonight’s short,
but I’d really like to have dinner

00:18.893 --> 00:20.437
with you soon.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.772
-I’d like that.
-Friday?

00:23.398 --> 00:27.277
-I have to check. yeah, it’s clear.
-(CHUCKLES)

00:45.211 --> 00:46.296
JOHN: What have we got?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.964
BOMB SQUAD SERGEANT:
Looks like a pretty basic device

00:48.089 --> 00:50.091
Enough to take out the car,
but not much more than that.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.594
What are the chances of recovering
anything we can trace?

00:52.677 --> 00:53.928
BOMB SQUAD SERGEANT: Not good.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.431
How much expertise
you figure was required? (SIGHS)

00:56.681 --> 00:58.600
BOMB SQUAD SERGEANT: Anyone with
ordnance training in the military

00:58.683 --> 01:00.602
could have done it.
There’s a dozen books available

01:00.727 --> 01:02.729
on the internet.
Take you through it step by step.

01:02.937 --> 01:03.938
ANDY: Any ID?

01:04.064 --> 01:07.150
Yeah, his name is Brett Keenan.
That’s his daughter over there.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.069
-(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
-ANDY: Where was she when it happened?

01:09.152 --> 01:11.404
Pulling into the garage. She heard it.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.742
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:18.286 --> 01:20.872
-Miss Keenan, is it?
-Right.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.624
I’m very sorry about your dad.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.417
It’s not a great way to start your day,
is it?

01:24.626 --> 01:26.503
-You work here?
-Right.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.506
-You know how long the car had been here?
-Since last week.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.841
He was traveling on business,
got back last night

01:31.925 --> 01:33.718
and went straight
to his apartment from the airport.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.720
He had a meeting this morning
in New Jersey,

01:36.012 --> 01:37.764
which is where he was on his way to.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.558
Are you aware of any disputes
he might have been having with anyone?

01:40.642 --> 01:43.436
There’s always disputes.
It’s the nature of the business.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.397
What we’re interested in is anything
that might have led to violence.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.441
This wasn’t a businessperson
that did this.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.777
This was an aberrant, sick individual

01:50.860 --> 01:52.821
who held my father responsible
for something.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.365
-Any guess who that might be?
-None.

01:56.157 --> 01:59.452
We’d like to get a list of past
and present employees, if we could?

01:59.661 --> 02:00.870
Okay.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.789
What was your father’s personal life like?

02:02.997 --> 02:04.707
He divorced my mother forever ago.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.127
He had a rotation
of willing B-school graduates

02:07.252 --> 02:10.004
to service him
in return for being able to say they did.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.549
That’s as much of a personal life
as he had.

02:12.715 --> 02:13.967
Whoever killed your father

02:14.050 --> 02:16.886
was knowledgeable in explosives.
Does that suggest anyone in particular?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.430
If it did, I would have told you already.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.183
Now, I have a conference in Frankfurt
to prepare for

02:22.267 --> 02:24.686
and a funeral to plan.
Is there anything else?

02:25.895 --> 02:29.065
-If we could get that list.
-It’s upstairs in my office.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.862

Bomb went off
when he started the ignition. (EXHALES)

03:56.402 --> 03:57.904
The car sat for almost a weeks,
So there was

03:57.987 --> 03:59.239
plenty of time to rig the thing.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.282
-Any history of threats?
-ANDY: Not that we know of.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.452
We got a list of past and present
employees from his daughter.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.330
(SCOFFS) And who by the way is one
of the coldest human beings I’ve ever met.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.748
-Oh, yeah?
-THOMAS: Unbelievable.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.291
Because it's the bomb
the feds are interested in

04:10.583 --> 04:12.919
-being a possible terrorist link.
-As is my boss.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.088
So far, we haven’t got anything
that points in that direction.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.006
If you need a search warrant,
court order, anything,

04:17.090 --> 04:18.424
-will you let me know?
-Absolutely.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.343
Chief of Detectives
has already called twice.

04:21.010 --> 04:24.222
Whatever you know,
as soon as you know it, bring it to me.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.556
You got it.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.810
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

04:29.310 --> 04:31.854
Hey, uh, we should divide up the names,
uh, call and have them come in.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.065
All right, we’ll start
with the former employees.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.566
When we’re done interviewing them,
we’ll move on

04:35.650 --> 04:36.901
-to the present ones, right?
-Okay

04:37.068 --> 04:38.319
You’ll call me
If you’re taking a statement?

-Just so happens, I am.

Looks like about 200 dollars in cash.

Let’s go talk to the garbage man.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.023
Hey. Found the body?

-Yeah.
-What time?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.444
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
About a quarter to 7:00.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.447
I see kids up here all the time,
smoking dope and whatnot.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.117
-Ever see this one?
-(SIGHS) I didn’t look at his face.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.702
Do us a favor and look?

06:09.786 --> 06:13.331
I’d really rather not.
I got a thing about dead people.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.376
I... I... I think of the family.
I can’t stand it. (BREATHES HEAVILY)

-Phil.

-Phil Beckett?
-That’s me.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.579
Detective Medavoy.
Why don’t you come this way?

06:53.746 --> 06:54.789
PHIL: Sure.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.380
This is Phil Beckett, Detective Jones.

07:03.339 --> 07:07.176
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah. This is about Brett Keenan?

07:07.385 --> 07:08.469
Why do you say that?

07:08.636 --> 07:11.222
I ran into him on Madison Avenue,
not two weeks ago.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.849
We swore we’d get together.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.726
I called his office this morning
to set a date

07:15.977 --> 07:17.478
and they told me what happened.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.565
What were the circumstances
of your leaving the company?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.733
Well, circumstances were

07:22.817 --> 07:26.237
that it was time. I mean,
Brett offered me crazy money to stay, but

07:26.946 --> 07:29.991
if he taught me anything, he taught me
that you have to be willing to take risks.

07:30.366 --> 07:34.078
I wanted to build my own business,
I had to leave the nest to do that.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.956
-So, you parted on good terms?
-I loved this guy.

07:37.373 --> 07:39.876
He’s ten years younger than me
and I considered him my mentor.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.796
I just hope his daughter won’t have
to see his body all burnt up.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.757
I’m sure they’ll do their best
to spare her that.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.302
And what was your position exactly?

07:49.385 --> 07:52.763
I was in cost accounting,
personnel, long-term planning.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.850
Brett would send me in
to put out fires, basically.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.685
I was his go-to guy.
That’s what he called me.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.689
Can you think of anyone Brett dealt with
who had a knowledge of explosives?

08:02.190 --> 08:05.234
I’ll tell you what comes to mind,
and you can make of this what you will.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.487
He was down in Colombia last year,

08:07.778 --> 08:10.948
to try to nail down a contract
to provide cell phone service.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.034
Now, I know he had dealing
with the government.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.453
I know there were all kind of shenanigans
go on down there,

08:15.536 --> 08:18.414
and I know that he had a problem
with his security service.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.875
-Do you know what the problem was?
-I do not.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.172
Excuse me just a second. (EXHALES) Yeah?

08:29.050 --> 08:32.094
Then tell him to get the figures
from Howard, keep on going with the report

08:32.178 --> 08:34.055
and I’ll find time for him
by the end of the week.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.391
Call and tell him I’m running
ten to 15 minutes late.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.477
Yeah. Sorry.

08:39.727 --> 08:44.065
Yeah, so if, uh, we need information
on any of these names,

08:44.190 --> 08:45.233
where do we reach you?

08:45.358 --> 08:49.362
Uh... forget about these office numbers.
Just call my cell phone.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.073
I’m reachable 24 hours a day.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.493
-GREG: Thank you.
-PHIL: Mm-hmm.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.876
What can you tell us
about the kids he hung out with?

09:03.960 --> 09:07.088
Um... ordinary kids... nice kids.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.507
I just want to sell everything
and move away from here.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.008
I know.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.428
Did anything happen at school
that you think might be related to this?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.430
He went to Coventry, for God’s sake.

09:17.723 --> 09:22.144
Oh, my God. But...
There’s his backpack. (SNIFFLES)

09:22.353 --> 09:25.356

yesterday and left it there.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.440

09:26.566 --> 09:28.776

who didn’t go to Coventry?

-If they didn’t go to Coventry,
-(SNIFFLES)

09:30.236 --> 09:33.447
They went to Fieldston,
or Dalton or Collegiate.

-Pot, like any other teenager.

-What a waste of a life.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.665

would have gotten pot from?

09:42.957 --> 09:44.792
For God’s sakes,
it’s on every street corner.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.128
Is that what you’re gonna focus on,
that he smoked pot?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.879
We’re trying to figure out
who killed him, sir.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.256
If we know it was a drug deal,

09:50.423 --> 09:53.050
-that might lead us to them...
-RACHEL: Stop saying that.

09:53.175 --> 09:58.139
Jared wasn’t involved in drugs
or drug deals or anything like that.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.516

10:02.184 --> 10:04.604
Do take Jared's backpack out of here,
please.

-Yes.

JARED'S DAD: Inez knew him his whole life.

10:10.109 --> 10:16.824
We, um... we pay for her son
to go to Coventry with... with Jared.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.869
-That’s very generous of you.
-It was Jared's idea.

10:20.286 --> 10:24.332
(EXHALES) That’s the kind of kid he was.

Uh... the, uh,
outfit providing security for Keenan,

10:39.847 --> 10:42.433
when he was in Colombia
was Carlson and Associates.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.727
And they said the problem was
with a bodyguard named, Avi Mosier.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.936
What kind of problem was it?

10:46.062 --> 10:47.730
All they would say
was that they let Mosier go,

10:47.813 --> 10:49.649
and he’s currently working
for another security firm.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.317
I’m calling over there now.

-What’s the problem?
-We just need to talk to you.

-So talk.
-We’re not gonna talk here, Avi.

11:22.139 --> 11:25.184
-We need you to come with us.
-I got a guy inside I’m bodyguard for.

-Right.

trying to make sense
out of what happened. (EXHALES)

12:09.395 --> 12:11.355
What can you tell us about Jared,
Dr. Weaver?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.983
I didn’t know him too well.
His records indicate

12:14.066 --> 12:15.818
that while he wasn’t
an outstanding student,

12:15.985 --> 12:17.820
he did the work required of him.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.240
-Never failed any courses.
-Any problems related to drugs?

12:21.615 --> 12:24.744
None that I know of.
It should be noted that at Coventry,

12:24.827 --> 12:27.329
we have a zero-tolerance policy
regarding drugs.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.914
What does that mean exactly?

The first time you’re caught,
it’s an automatic suspension.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.252
Second time, it’s an automatic expulsion.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.755
Can you tell us anything
about the crowd Jared ran with?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.214
I think it’s fair to say he was among

12:37.298 --> 12:39.383
the more popular,
socially active students.

12:39.508 --> 12:40.593
With a fair amount of money.

12:40.676 --> 12:43.387

to the school.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.264
I assumed Jared as well.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.308
You think it was possible
that someone was shaking him down?

12:47.475 --> 12:50.811
Uh... anything is possible.
I would doubt, if that was the case,

12:50.978 --> 12:53.355
it was another Coventry student doing it.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.941
There are families here
with a lot more money than the Tinsley's.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.444
Was Jared ever in trouble
for anything other than drugs?

12:59.361 --> 13:02.198
We make it a practice here
to keep our student records confidential.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.325
You know that if necessary,
we can get a court order.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.993
I don’t think there is anything
in his records

13:06.076 --> 13:08.704
-that relates to this.
-Dr. Weaver, with all due respect,

13:08.829 --> 13:11.040
this might not be something
you’re in a position to know.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.625
What I am in a position to know

13:12.708 --> 13:14.668
is that families who entrust us
with their children,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.171
expect us to be discreet
about what happens here.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.632
One of those families’ child
was just killed.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.592
I can promise you that discretion

13:21.717 --> 13:24.345
is low on the list of things
they’re currently expecting from us.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.472
That means if you force us
to get a court order,

13:26.597 --> 13:28.891
we’re gonna comb through
not only the records of Jared Tinsley,

13:29.016 --> 13:31.268
but of every student
that Jared came into contact with.

13:35.689 --> 13:40.069
Six months ago, Jared and a female student
were discovered in an empty classroom,

13:40.152 --> 13:42.571
engaging in sexually
inappropriate behavior.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.866
Both were required to write a letter
of apology to the school.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.662
Both were given a warning,
that if any subsequent incident occurred,

13:49.745 --> 13:51.747
both sets of parents would be notified.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.749
-What’s the girl’s name?
-ROGER: She comes from a good family.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.835
I know this would cause them
a lot of pain.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.878
We’ll be as discreet as possible.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.048
Her name is Quinnie Stein.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.142
-What happened, Avi?
-You and Brett Keenan, didn’t get along?

14:12.476 --> 14:15.354
In Bogotá, your bodyguard with you 24/7.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.690
Who knows?
Maybe he couldn’t stand Israelis.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.776
-That sound likely?
-Why not? I can’t stand them and I am one.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.821
-JOHN: When’s the last time you saw him?
-AVI: When I leave Bogotá.

14:23.988 --> 14:24.989
No contact since then?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.491
No, why? Somebody threaten him?
You think it’s me?

14:27.616 --> 14:30.578
You were trained in the use of explosives,
when you were in the Israeli Army,

14:30.661 --> 14:31.871
-is that right?
-Right.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.581
So, if you wanted to make a car explode

14:33.664 --> 14:36.208
When the driver turned on the ignition,
you know how to do that.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.087
Hey, guys, I make good living.
I have a beautiful American girlfriend

14:40.212 --> 14:41.255
and a condo in Fort Lee.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.008
-Why I want to blow up cars for?
-Brett Keenan’s dead, Avi.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.427
-Somebody blew up his car.
-You think I do this?

14:46.760 --> 14:47.845
We know he got you fired.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.180
(SCOFFS) Big deal. I get another job
one, two, three.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.766
You want to tell us the truth
of why it was you got fired?

14:54.435 --> 14:56.812
-I sleep with his daughter.
-He found out?

14:56.896 --> 15:00.524
(SCOFFS) We’re together all the time,
how could he not find out? (EXHALES)

15:00.608 --> 15:03.611
She talked to him, I talked to him,
he don’t want to listen to nothing.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.779
He called the office,
"Say goodbye to Avi."

15:05.946 --> 15:07.239
When’s the last time
you saw his daughter?

15:07.781 --> 15:08.991
What difference does this make?

15:09.283 --> 15:12.161
We’re gonna ask you to just
answer the questions for right now,

15:12.244 --> 15:14.663
not worry about the significance of them.
Hmm?

15:15.414 --> 15:18.167
I see her now and then. We keep it quiet.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.836
All right. We’re gonna need for you
to stay here for a while.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.047
You gonna tell my boss I’m a suspect, huh?

15:23.213 --> 15:25.966
-Not yet.
-You do, I lose this job, too.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.972
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(SIGHS) Are my parents coming down here?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.098
No, Quinnie.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.726
At 17, you’re old enough,
we can talk to you yourself.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.771
Soon as we’re done,
we’ll drive you back over to school.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.980
QUINNIE: It doesn’t matter.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.441
When you showed up,
I was ready to ditch school.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.611
(EXHALES) I’m, like,
so emotional about this, I don’t even know

15:45.819 --> 15:47.905
if I can talk about it
without breaking down.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.907
(EXHALES) You break down, you break down.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.076
(EXHALES) Okay.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.828
-You and Jared were going out?
-Not really.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.705
-LAURA: Just friends?
-Yeah.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.125
-When’s the last time you saw him?
-Yesterday at school.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.461
-LAURA: Did you talk to him after school?
-No.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.547
-What’d you do after school?
-What did I do? Like,

16:06.131 --> 16:09.510
hung out at the park, went home,
did homework, went to sleep.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.428
Any idea who Jared
went to meet last night?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.139
-No.
-Did you used to get high with Jared?

16:14.431 --> 16:17.476
-I don’t get high.
-LAURA: Jared did, though, right?

16:17.768 --> 16:21.480
-I guess. Just pot, though.
-You know where he got it from?

16:21.855 --> 16:24.817
-No idea.
-Hmm.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.612
No idea about that, you don’t get high,
and you and Jared were just friends.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.240
-You think I’m lying?
-We know that you and Jared were caught

16:31.323 --> 16:32.908
having sex in an empty classroom, Quinnie.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.954
First of all, it was only oral.
Second of all, so what?

16:37.121 --> 16:39.039
You think that means we were going out?

16:39.123 --> 16:42.501
Here’s the thing, Quinnie,
this is a homicide investigation.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.879
That means there are no secrets anymore.
We’re gonna look into Jared's life

16:45.963 --> 16:49.258
-and the life of everyone he knows.
-What does that mean?

16:49.341 --> 16:52.136
It means, we’re going to talk
to your friends, your parents,

16:52.386 --> 16:54.013
anyone who might
conceivably know anything.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.724
Okay, please don’t tell my parents
about that.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.101
-Please.
-Then don’t hold anything back.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.813
I’m, like, sick with grief,
and you’re treating me like a suspect.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.773
Where did Jared score his pot?

17:06.066 --> 17:08.819
-From Serge.
-You’ll tell us how to find Serge?

17:09.111 --> 17:11.613
(EXHALES) Is there any chance
you won’t broadcast it all over the world

17:11.697 --> 17:12.990
that I did?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.076
-Yes, Quinnie.
-If at all possible,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.579
I would really like not to be known
as a narc.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.548
-SERGE: Who’s there?
-(DOG BARKING)

17:29.673 --> 17:32.217
-Police.
-SERGE: What’s the problem?

17:32.426 --> 17:34.553
There’s no problem,
we just want to talk to you.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.180
SERGE: What do you want to talk
to me about?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.514
We’ll explain that inside.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.226
-We don’t conduct business in hallways.
-SERGE: I’m really kind of busy right now.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.603
This won’t take long.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.729
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

17:46.023 --> 17:49.359
You know, I'm really not comfortable
having you guys barge in on me like this.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.154
If we have to get a search warrant,
we’ll do that.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.280
Then when we come back,

17:53.363 --> 17:56.825
we’ll want to know why is was you
so reluctant to open the door.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.294
-How do you know Jared Tinsley, Serge?
-From around.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.713
Overlapping social circles.
That kind of thing.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.924
RITA: Did those social circles
ever overlap into drug sales?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.051
No, they didn’t.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.931
-Can I help you with something?
-I’m fine. Just answer her questions.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.725
You’re fine,
but you’re looking in my bathroom.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.519
I want to make sure,
there’s no one else in here.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.854
When’s the last time you saw Jared?

18:26.355 --> 18:29.316
-I have no idea.
-Where were you last night, Serge?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.902
-At a party in Williamsburg.
-Until what time?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.446
-Where are you going?
-Thought I heard something.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.697
RITA: Hey, relax.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.200
I’m not gonna relax.
She has no right to go in there.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.328
(WHISTLES) Look at this,

18:41.453 --> 18:43.997
The Brooklyn Botanical gardens.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.750
Now we have a problem.

18:47.501 --> 18:52.047
(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)

19:04.351 --> 19:07.729
Can you tell me exactly what it is
that couldn’t be discussed on the phone?

19:07.855 --> 19:09.356
Why don’t you come down here, Miss Keenan?

19:11.525 --> 19:13.694
When’s the last time you saw, Avi Mosier?

19:13.777 --> 19:15.529
What does that have to do with anything?

19:15.654 --> 19:18.782
Maybe just let us ask the questions
for right now. Huh?

19:18.907 --> 19:21.285
I don’t know when the last time
I saw him was.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.370
Since you’ve been back from Colombia?

19:23.620 --> 19:26.582
-Yeah.
-Did your father know you were seeing him?

19:27.249 --> 19:29.001
I’m 27 years old.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.170
I don’t clear it with my father
who I'm seeing.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.422
How did he find out you were
seeing him in Colombia?

19:33.589 --> 19:36.842
He sensed it, he asked me about it
and I told him.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.760
In retrospect, I shouldn’t have done that.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.514
-Why would it represent a problem?
-Because it was a distraction.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.186
Daddy wanted me concentrating on business
and Avi concentrating on body guarding.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.855
ANDY: Did Avi ever look for you
to make it right?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.774
Why would he do that? I’m not his mother.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.027
He got fired, he got fired.
Boo-fricking-hoo.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.820
Go out and get another job.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.406
Speaking of that,
we wanted to go over some people

19:59.531 --> 20:01.450
that were on the list
that we got from you.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.410
-(CHUCKLES) God, now?
-Yeah, now.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.495
I don’t have time now.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.373
And where did you find out about Avi?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.876
We heard there was a problem
with the bodyguards in Colombia.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.461
Who even knew about that?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.296
A colleague of your father
apparently knew.

20:14.630 --> 20:18.717
Yeah, I know all my father’s colleagues.
I can’t imagine any one of them

20:18.884 --> 20:21.929
paying attention to something
as trivial as a bodyguard. (EXHALES)

20:22.179 --> 20:23.180
Phil Beckett.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.058
I would hardly call Phil Beckett
a colleague.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.811
-What would you call him?
-An idiot, a flunky.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.106
-My father couldn’t stand him.
-He worked there 11 years.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.817
Yeah, performing marginally at best.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.237
When my father decided
to clear out the dead wood,

20:38.320 --> 20:41.406
-He was one of the first to go.
-He said they parted on good terms.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.243
If you call being escorted out
of the building by security

20:44.326 --> 20:46.078
"good terms," Then they did.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.456
(INHALES) Now, who else do you want
to know about?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.084
(SCOFFS)

20:56.588 --> 20:59.800
-Can I, um, offer you, uh, something?
-No, thanks.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.761
What we’d really like to do, if we could,
is take a look around your garage.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.013
Hey, your husband told us
he has some company records

21:05.138 --> 21:06.473
from when he was working
with Brett Keenan.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.518
(GROANS) I don’t think there’s anything
like that in the garage.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.270
Would you mind terribly
if we took a look?

21:11.728 --> 21:14.523
No, not at all. Uh, please.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.117
Where is your husband working currently,
Mrs. Beckett?

21:25.200 --> 21:28.120
Um, his office is over by Columbus circle.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.579
-It’s his own company?
-Yes, it is.

21:29.663 --> 21:33.667
He very much wanted to be his own boss
after he left working with, um, Brett.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.544
We haven’t been able
to get in touch with him

21:35.627 --> 21:37.004
at any of the numbers that he gave us.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.589
Oh, you know, for some reason,
he’s had nothing but problems

21:39.715 --> 21:41.174
with the phones in that building.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.635
-(DRAWER OPENING)
-He’s also not answering his cell phone.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.179
FRANCINE: Well, maybe he had a meeting.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.017
Do you know what your husband’s doing
with ammonium nitrate?

21:50.142 --> 21:51.935
Well, he comes in here at night and he...

21:52.102 --> 21:53.770
he gets involved
in so many different projects,

21:53.895 --> 21:55.856
I’ve lost track.
You... you’ll really have to ask him.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.316
When’s he due back?

21:57.983 --> 22:01.278
Well, un... unfortunately, he’s leaving
for the airport this afternoon.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.779
He has a meeting
in Atlanta in the morning

22:02.863 --> 22:06.033
and he said he was making a 5:30 flight
out of LaGuardia, so... (EXHALES)

22:06.283 --> 22:08.535
We’re gonna need you to come with us,
Mrs. Beckett.

22:08.618 --> 22:13.874
-Why? W... what... what's going on here?
-We need you to help us find him. Please.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.515
Everything I was growing
was for medical purposes.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.435
-What are you sick with?
-Chronic fatigue syndrome.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.021
That’s for real.
I also like to be able to provide it

22:36.146 --> 22:39.900
to other people who are sick,
maybe so they suffer a little less.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.569
-Is that so wrong?
-Do you provide it free of charge?

22:42.694 --> 22:45.447
Compare my profit margin
with the drug companies,

22:45.530 --> 22:48.325
I come off
like mother freakin’ Teresa, all right?

22:48.408 --> 22:50.285
Did you provide pot to Jared Tinsley?

22:50.369 --> 22:53.538
I have a confidential relationship
with my customers.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.165
I do not divulge.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.542
You said you went to a party
in Williamsburg last night.

22:57.667 --> 23:02.089
-What time did you leave?
-I don’t know. 10:30, 11:00.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.424
-Where’d you go?
-I came back to the city.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.718
Where’d you go in the city?
I went to Veselka,

23:06.927 --> 23:08.553
had a bowl of split pea soup,

23:08.762 --> 23:11.640
and I left Veselka,
stopped off at the Gem Spa.

23:12.265 --> 23:15.352
Bought a copy of Spin
The Nation, The Robb Report.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.104
Then I went home.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.439
-Did you stay at home?
-Yes, I did.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.192
RITA: Is there anyone
who can vouch for you staying home?

23:22.818 --> 23:26.071
I talked to some people on the phone,
talked to some people online.

23:26.488 --> 23:30.742
-What is this, the inquisition?
-Jared Tinsley was killed last night.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.831
Well, guys, I grow pot, all right?
I don’t do violence.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.834
Even when people don’t pay me,
I just let it go, you know?

23:38.959 --> 23:42.421
(EXHALES) The thing is since he was killed
and you’ve been busted,

23:42.629 --> 23:43.922
you’re in a position to help yourself.

23:44.172 --> 23:45.215
What are we talking about?

23:45.590 --> 23:48.427
You give us information that helps us
find out who killed Jared,

23:48.510 --> 23:50.470
we’ll talk to the DA
about going easy on you.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.056
Going easy? As in I walk.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.434
You’re not in a position
to negotiate here.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.936
There was enough weight
in that farm you had going for you

23:58.145 --> 24:00.313
to spend your next ten birthdays
locked up.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.526
On the other hand, if you cooperate,
we may be inclined to persuade the DA

24:04.651 --> 24:07.237
that there were some problems
with the legality of the search.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.530
Up to you.

24:11.199 --> 24:15.120
All right. I fronted Jared
about five pounds a month.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.165
He’d break it up into quarter ounces
and sell it.

24:18.248 --> 24:22.252
-He have any partners?
-This kid Javier, who’s his maid’s son.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.212
I know he worked for him.

24:24.379 --> 24:28.175
Jared kept what he needed
on any given day in Javier’s locker,

24:28.842 --> 24:31.011
’cause he was paranoid
about getting busted.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.346
I hope that’s gonna do it, guys.

24:34.389 --> 24:37.017
-That’s all I got.
-We’ll let you know.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.818
Can I talk to you privately?

24:48.111 --> 24:49.362
Let’s go in here.

25:02.792 --> 25:03.835
(SIGHS)

25:04.294 --> 25:07.005
(INHALES) Uh... you said that
if there were any secrets,

25:07.088 --> 25:08.465
you’d find them out.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.051
Is there one you held back on?

25:12.052 --> 25:13.929
Jared got me pregnant.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.265
Even though,
I would have had to leave school

25:17.724 --> 25:21.686
and even though it would have completely
turned my life upside down.

25:22.312 --> 25:26.233
Even though everything,
I wanted to have that baby.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.695
-He talked you out of it?
-He said he’d say it wasn’t his.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.658
He said if I had it,
he’d have nothing to do with me.

25:34.741 --> 25:39.287
(INHALES) I couldn’t tell my parents.
They wouldn’t have let me keep it,

25:39.371 --> 25:40.914
and they wouldn’t have let me
have an abortion.

25:41.665 --> 25:45.043
They would have made me have it
and then give it up for adoption...

25:45.126 --> 25:47.963
(INHALES) ...or thrown me out
into the street.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.341
-Who made the arrangements?
-Jared maid.

25:51.925 --> 25:56.137
(EXHALES) She took me to a clinic
in Washington Heights after school.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.766
(INHALES) And when it was over,
she took me home.

26:00.767 --> 26:06.189
She was crying.
I was... (INHALES) ...numb.

26:07.816 --> 26:10.986
(CHUCKLES) Jared's proud of it, though.

26:11.152 --> 26:14.739
(INHALES) He’d never do it around me
'cause I’d kill him, but...

26:15.532 --> 26:18.201
I’ve heard that he brags
about how we did the deed

26:18.285 --> 26:20.704
and then he had to take care of it.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.708
He took care of it.

26:26.167 --> 26:29.129
(INHALES) He was playing
basketball that day.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.483
Mrs. Tinsley will be home
in about one hour.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.652
We’d actually like to talk to you, Inez.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.905
-Your son wasn’t in school today.
-Yeah, he wasn’t feeling good.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.825
-I told him he could stay home.
-But he’s not at home.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.910
Maybe he go out for a little while.

27:01.077 --> 27:03.705
-Where would he have gone?
-How come you want to know?

27:03.788 --> 27:06.791
-We need to talk to him about Jared.
-He don’t know anything.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.043
Was he friends with him?

27:08.251 --> 27:10.670
They knew each other.
I don’t think friends.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.006
-Did Jared ever get him into trouble?
-INEZ: No.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.133
Why was your son suspended?

27:15.216 --> 27:17.927
Just fooling around. Doing what kids do.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.472
It was drugs. He got busted with drugs.

27:20.555 --> 27:23.475
He made a mistake and he was sorry.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.311
He promise me it never happen again.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.355
Did he know you got that girl an abortion?

27:28.521 --> 27:30.940
If Jared tell him, then he knows.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.401
Was it Jared who asked you to do it?

27:34.319 --> 27:37.155
He came to me crying,
like he did when he was a baby.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.867
He said he couldn’t tell his parents
and the girl couldn’t tell her parents,

27:41.034 --> 27:43.703
so the only one that could help them
was me.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.956
God, forgive me. I knew it was wrong.

27:47.415 --> 27:50.001
But I... I took care of him
all of his life,

27:50.085 --> 27:52.545
so I... I said I would do it.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.256
-Where’s your son now, Inez?
-I don’t know.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.385
Inez. (SPEAKING SPANISH)

27:58.468 --> 27:59.761
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

27:59.844 --> 28:01.930
RITA: Then we have to
consider him a fugitive.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.140
That means putting his description
out over the radio

28:04.224 --> 28:06.434
and police all over the city
looking for him.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.436
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

28:09.604 --> 28:11.523
I... I’ll find him.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.072
Whatever you found in that garage
is gonna get thrown out,

28:19.197 --> 28:21.241
-’cause you didn’t get a warrant.
-We had consent.

28:21.449 --> 28:24.411
When it’s her husband standing trial,
you don’t think she’s gonna deny that?

28:24.494 --> 28:26.246
-We’re getting the warrant.
-THOMAS: It’s too late.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.331
If you had any suspicion,
you should have gotten it

28:28.415 --> 28:30.333
before you ever set foot in there.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.293
Right, you know of a judge
who would have signed a warrant

28:32.419 --> 28:33.503
on our mere suspicions?

28:33.878 --> 28:36.256
You got a DA who’s been camped out here
all day on this case.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.507
She would have drawn it up.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.384
She’s still got to get a judge to sign it.

28:39.509 --> 28:41.678
Before we went in that garage,
we had nothing.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.388
Yeah, let’s just hope we can find the guy.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.099
What you better hope
is that you get a confession.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.308
(DOOR KNOCKING)

28:48.101 --> 28:50.103
I told Francine
that the most important thing now

28:50.186 --> 28:51.980
is that we speak to her husband directly.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.065
See the thing is,
he’s... he's gotta be in Atlanta.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.442
Atlanta might have to wait.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.445
But he said he was meeting
with the Coca-Cola people.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.448
Mrs. Beckett, we’re very concerned
that whoever killed Brett Keenan

29:01.573 --> 29:05.243
-may be going after your husband next.
-(GASPS) Why would they do that?

29:05.535 --> 29:07.537
Your husband was Brett’s go-to guy, right?

29:07.620 --> 29:08.955
That’s what he used to tell me.

29:09.038 --> 29:11.583
Yeah, so, for that reason,
we think he may be marked.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.043
-Oh, my God.
-You have to help us find him.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.130
Why can’t you just call him
and tell him all that?

29:17.464 --> 29:20.967
Ah, we don’t want to spook him.
Sometimes people hear something like that

29:21.092 --> 29:24.053
-and they do something foolish.
-They might get themselves killed.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.475
(INHALES) Well... what can I do?

29:33.980 --> 29:36.900
-Let me know when you have him in custody.
-Yes, boss.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.997

coming from your cell phone,

29:51.122 --> 29:52.499
-chances are he’ll pick up.
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

29:52.582 --> 29:54.083
What you have to do then

29:54.209 --> 29:56.628
is keep him on the phone long enough,
for us to get a location, huh.

29:56.711 --> 30:00.006
-But what do I say?
-Just say what you normally say.

we could take a drive this weekend.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.610
to get something to eat,
after that I was home.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.862
-Your mom with you?
-She was at work.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.906
How come you got suspended from school?

33:12.281 --> 33:13.282
I got caught with some weed.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.493
-Whose was it?
-Mine.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.870
-You weren’t holding for anybody?
-Hell, no.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.498
You were holding for Jared, Javier.
We know this.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.792
Now what happened?
You didn’t want to hold for him anymore?

33:23.334 --> 33:25.503
Why do you think I was holding it for him?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.672
If I hold, I hold it for my own self.

33:27.922 --> 33:30.091
We think you were holding it for him,
’cause he asked you to.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.551
I ain’t no retard.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.428
I ain’t gonna do something stupid,

33:33.511 --> 33:36.014
-just ’cause somebody asks me to.
-We don’t think that.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.724
We think you wanted
to get a good education

33:37.807 --> 33:38.891
and make your mother proud of you.

33:39.058 --> 33:41.686
The first time you got caught,
it meant you got suspended.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.604
If you got caught again,
you would’ve gotten kicked out.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.314
But Jared figured he had the right to ask,

33:45.398 --> 33:46.858
since his parents were paying
for you to go there.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.526
You guys got it all twisted up, man.

33:48.651 --> 33:51.237
What did he say when you told him
you didn’t want to hold anymore?

33:51.487 --> 33:52.530
JAVIER: Nothing.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.407
-RITA: I don’t think it was nothing.
-It was nothing.

33:54.490 --> 33:55.700
I don’t think spreading it around

33:55.783 --> 33:57.952
that your mom arranged
that girl’s abortion was nothing.

34:02.165 --> 34:05.585
(INHALES) My mom’s been wiping his ass
since he was a baby.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.004
And now he’s all grown up,
he figured the same way

34:08.129 --> 34:10.590
my mom worked for his parents,
that I’d work for him.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.552
What did he say when you told him
you didn’t want to do it anymore?

34:14.719 --> 34:18.181
Either I kept the weed willingly
or that he’d plant it on me.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.225
And if it was the word of a kid
whose parents paid two tuitions

34:21.392 --> 34:23.394
and gave 20,000 a year on top of that.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.064
Against the word of a kid
whose mother was a maid,

34:26.189 --> 34:28.066
who did I think they’d believe?

34:28.191 --> 34:30.109
-What did you tell him?
-I would take my chances.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.652
That’s when you brought your mother
into it.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.572
He knew she was ashamed
of doing that for that girl.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.742
He said his parents would
fire her ass if they knew.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.536
He said to keep me in school
with all those rich white kids,

34:40.995 --> 34:43.748
he’d have her turning tricks
out on 116th Street.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.416
He’d have her down on her knees...

34:47.085 --> 34:49.212
-(SIGHS)
-Tell when you hit him, Javier?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.465
She raised him, you know?

34:53.841 --> 34:56.010
More than his own parents did.

34:56.719 --> 35:00.807
She raised me and she raised him
and one of us had to stand up for her.

35:06.354 --> 35:10.191
Yeah... (EXHALES) ...I hit him.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.361
I beat his head into the ground.

(SIGHS)

35:28.960 --> 35:30.169
Where is he?

35:31.712 --> 35:34.757
-He’s gonna have to stay here for a while.
-What did he do?

35:36.092 --> 35:39.846
(EXHALES) It was him
who killed Jared, Inez.

a lot of money on a lawyer.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.355
Let legal aid provide one.

If you’re not happy with them,
you can always switch.

35:52.608 --> 35:57.405
-(SNIFFLES) This is... this is murder?
-It’s probably manslaughter.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.657
-INEZ: Prison?
-Maybe.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.243
-There were extenuating circumstances.
-(INEZ SNIFFLES)

36:02.952 --> 36:04.662
Your son’s a good boy.

36:04.912 --> 36:08.374
-The court might be pretty sympathetic.
-What were they?

36:08.583 --> 36:11.836
What were these extenuating circumstances?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.337
Your son can tell you that.

your own company,

36:22.138 --> 36:23.848
Phil, why were you driving a cab?

36:24.932 --> 36:27.018
Driving a taxicab,
where does that put you?

36:27.685 --> 36:30.605
Out on the street,

36:30.771 --> 36:33.232
lets you talk to a broad cross
section of people.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.818
-Brett Keenan fired you.
-Where’d you hear that?

36:35.943 --> 36:38.279
He had you escorted out of the building.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.655
(CHUCKLES) I don’t know
where you’re getting

36:39.989 --> 36:41.991
-your information from, but...
-JOHN: That's enough, Phil,

36:42.074 --> 36:45.286
you kept it going as long as you could,
but it’s over now.

36:45.411 --> 36:47.371
I want to know who told you
that I was fired.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.789
We talked to his daughter.

36:48.998 --> 36:52.126
Oh. (SCOFFS) There’s an unimpeachable
source for you.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.462
We confirmed it with security personnel.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.089
Someone who woke up on third base
thought she’d hit a triple.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.342
You don’t have a company.
you don’t have an office.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.136
I proved the naysayers wrong before.
I’ll prove them wrong again.

37:02.261 --> 37:05.765
Phil, we’ve been in your garage.
We know you made the bomb.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.771
Well, I don’t know that you had the right
to go into my garage.

37:11.938 --> 37:15.024
Your wife let us in.
We’ve now got a search warrant.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.235
We’ve already found explosive chemicals.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.612
We’re gonna find diagrams.
That part is over.

37:19.946 --> 37:23.032
What you want to do now, Phil,
is to be truthful

37:23.241 --> 37:26.410
and try to cut the best deal you can
with the DA.

37:26.577 --> 37:29.080
To make this as easy as possible
on your wife.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.666
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

37:33.876 --> 37:35.836
She thinks I’m terrific, you know that?

37:36.462 --> 37:39.090
She thinks whatever I set my mind to,
I can do.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.758
ANDY: She’s a good wife. Hmm.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.053
Sends me off to work
with a hearty breakfast under my belt

37:44.178 --> 37:45.972
and a <i>Wall Street Journal </i>under my arm.

37:46.180 --> 37:49.475
She never knew what was waiting for me
when I got to the office.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.353
(INHALES) She never knew the way
that he made me feel,

37:52.937 --> 37:55.356
like I was stupid, incompetent.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.234
When did you decide to something about it?

37:58.359 --> 38:01.988
I worked for him 11 years.
I accepted that this was the way he was.

38:02.154 --> 38:04.699
Deliver excellence on demand.
First time, every time.

38:04.824 --> 38:07.285
No pats on the back, no margin for error.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.955
He decides to make changes
and I don’t fit in, that’s okay.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.540
What wasn’t okay?

38:13.499 --> 38:16.210
I needed an extension
on my health insurance.

38:16.585 --> 38:21.507
Francine... had something...
women’s problems.

38:22.550 --> 38:26.053
I went to him with it...
he was barely listening.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.098
I followed him out to the elevators.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.934
I told him
that she needed a special kind of therapy

38:32.059 --> 38:33.978
and if that didn’t work, an operation.

38:35.229 --> 38:36.522
And he said, uh...

38:38.316 --> 38:40.026
"Sorry, Kemosabe, no can do."

38:43.904 --> 38:45.281
So, you made the bomb?

38:45.406 --> 38:48.367
Yeah, I guess I wasn’t too stupid
to do that, was I, Brett?

38:49.493 --> 38:52.330
I delivered some real excellence
on demand that time.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.917
You’ll want to put all that
about your wife in the statement.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.713
I only hope when he turned the key...

39:02.340 --> 39:04.717
there was enough time for him
to realize who killed him.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.232
-Full confession.
-Ties to Al-Qaeda?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.360
Either that or a pissed off ex-employee.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.196
-DA taking a statement?
-She’s in there with him now.

You gonna run him over
to central booking?

40:04.193 --> 40:06.946

-I got to run home and feed the cat.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.990
