14:40.546 --> 14:42.423
- FRONT DOOR TERMINATED.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.800
- WOW, BEN.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.177
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS
NOT-WEAK SIDE OF YOU BEFORE.

14:54.351 --> 14:59.106
- AW, I MISS THE SCRATCHY FEEL
OF A QUALITY WOOL BERET.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.068
- ROOM SECURE!

15:03.152 --> 15:04.528
NO NEED TO PANIC, LITTLE LADIES.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.530
THIS WAS ONLY A DRILL.

15:06.614 --> 15:11.035
YOU MAY NOW CONTINUE DOING
GIRLY THINGS.

15:14.038 --> 15:14.913
[whistles]

15:18.042 --> 15:20.169
[all whooping]

15:20.252 --> 15:22.463
- SORRY WE CRASHED THE MEETING,
BUT ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT

15:22.546 --> 15:25.341
UNTIL YOU'RE A CERTIFIED
GORILLA.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.134
- YOU'RE COOL NOW,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT YET,

15:27.217 --> 15:30.429
WHICH MEANS
I CAN STILL BOSS YOU AROUND.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.639
I LIKE THAT.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.931
WANT TO HAVE A CRUSH ON ME?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.767
YOU'RE ALLOWED.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.648
- NAH, GONNA POUND SOME JUICE,

15:40.731 --> 15:42.858
MAYBE BURP
THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.

15:42.941 --> 15:43.525
I DON'T KNOW;
I DON'T MAKE PLANS.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.694
I LIVE IN THE NOW.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.283
- [burping]

15:51.367 --> 15:57.581
PERISH FROM THE...EARTH.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.459
- DUDE, YOU'RE SUCH A DUDE.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.711
- DUDE, WANNA GO FART
ON SQUIRRELS?

16:02.795 --> 16:06.507
- UH, NO, I'M GOOD.

16:06.590 --> 16:09.426
- WHATEVER, BRO.
SUIT YOURSELF.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.055
- TOOTING ON DEFENSELESS
RODENTS? PLEASE.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.557
WHEW, ALMOST DONE HERE, FING.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.102
I MEAN, I'M ALL FOR VENTURING
OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE,

16:18.185 --> 16:21.980
BUT I THINK I'M READY TO BE
A HONEYBEE AGAIN.

16:22.064 --> 16:26.193
YUP, IT'LL FEEL GOOD TO BE BACK
IN THE OLD BERET AND PIGTAILS,

16:26.276 --> 16:30.239
CHEWING TAFFY,
HANGING WITH MY BEES.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.157
- [Portia laughs annoyingly]

16:32.241 --> 16:34.076
- IF I LISTEN CLOSELY,
I CAN ALMOST HEAR PORTIA

16:34.159 --> 16:38.288
CRACKING UP
AT ONE OF MY JOKES RIGHT NOW.

16:38.372 --> 16:42.710
ACTUALLY, I CAN HEAR HER
EVEN IF I DON'T LISTEN CLOSELY.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.212
- [laughing continues]

16:45.295 --> 16:48.465
[owl hooting]

16:48.549 --> 16:49.717
- SO THEN THE DOG SAYS,

16:49.800 --> 16:52.720
"YOU CAN AT LEAST
BUY ME DINNER FIRST."

16:52.803 --> 16:53.637
[laughter]

16:53.721 --> 16:55.848
- THAT'S HUMOROUS.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.516
- UGH!
HE'S STEALING MY MATERIAL.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.102
- OMG, MESSIE.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.146
YOU'RE FINALLY AS FUNNY
AS YOUR FACE.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.272
[laughs]

17:03.355 --> 17:04.147
- THANKS.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.566
NOW, WHO WANTS A FRENCH BRAID?

17:05.648 --> 17:08.234
all: ME! ME!

17:10.445 --> 17:14.199
- IT'S TRUE; BEN DOES DO
A GREAT FRENCH BRAID.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.452
[sighs sadly]

17:18.037 --> 17:20.372
- READY
FOR YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE?

17:20.455 --> 17:22.332
- HIT ME!

17:22.415 --> 17:23.291
- ALL RIGHT.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.627
NORMALLY, THE FINAL GORILLA TEST

17:25.711 --> 17:28.464
INVOLVES DEPOISONING SNAKES
WHILE RIDING DIRT BIKES.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.425
[motor revs]

17:31.508 --> 17:34.094
BUT SINCE YOU'RE KICKING
SO MUCH BUTT,

17:34.178 --> 17:36.472
WE'RE GIVING YOU THE HONOR
OF REPRESENTING US

17:36.555 --> 17:38.098
IN THE SEMI-ANNUAL, ALL-TROOP,

17:38.182 --> 17:41.477
SILVERWARE-FREE STEAK-EATING
CONTEST--

17:41.560 --> 17:42.978
OR, AS I CALL IT,

17:43.061 --> 17:46.523
THE SEM-AN-AL-TRO-
SIL-FRE-STE-EAT-CON.

17:46.607 --> 17:51.153
- THE SEM-AN-AL-TRO-
SIL-FRE-STE-EAT-CON?

17:51.236 --> 17:53.655
BUT I'M REPRESENTING
THE HONEYBEES.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.450
CONFLICT!
DILEMMA! QUAGMIRE!

17:56.533 --> 18:00.162
UH, I'D LOVE TO, BUT I ONLY EAT
STEAKS I CATCH MYSELF.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.999
- HIGGENBOTTOM,
IF YOU DON'T DO THIS,

18:04.082 --> 18:05.417
YOU'LL NEVER BE A GORILLA.

18:05.501 --> 18:12.216
PLUS, YOU GET TO CRUSH
YOUR SISTER'S STUPID TROOP.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.550
- [laughs nervously]

18:13.634 --> 18:17.930
YEAH, YEAH, HER STRONG,
INDEPENDENT, STUPID TROOP.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.723
[sighs]
I'M IN.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.601
- HA HA! YEAH!

18:22.684 --> 18:24.186
[both whooping]

18:29.274 --> 18:30.984
- CHANGE OF PLANS.
YOU'RE BEN AGAIN.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.320
- SORRY, I KNOW IT'S FUN
BEING ME,

18:33.403 --> 18:34.530
BUT THE SEM-AN-AL-TRO-
SIL-FRE-STE-EAT-CON

18:34.613 --> 18:37.199
IS TOMORROW, AND I NEED
TO COMPETE AS A HONEYBEE,

18:37.282 --> 18:40.452
SO YOU HAVE TO COMPETE AS BEN
FOR THE GORILLAS.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.245
- NO WAY!

18:41.328 --> 18:43.997
- EATING IS ONE OF YOUR TALENTS.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.292
- NO, THE HONEYBEES
ACCEPT ME FOR ME!

18:47.376 --> 18:48.961
- BUT YOU'RE NOT YOU.
YOU'RE PRETENDING TO BE ME.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.838
YOU'RE NOT A HONEYBEE.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.048
- YOU'RE NOT A HONEYBEE.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.218
- REALLY?
YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT?

18:56.301 --> 18:57.845
THAT'S YOUR FINAL INSULT?

18:57.928 --> 19:00.055
- IF YOU MAKE ME LEAVE
THE HONEYBEES,

19:00.138 --> 19:01.849
I'LL EXPOSE YOUR TIME
AS A GORILLA.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.600
AND SINCE BEING IN TWO TROOPS
AT ONCE

19:03.684 --> 19:05.477
IS A VIOLATION
OF HONEYBEE BYLAWS,

19:05.561 --> 19:07.646
YOU'LL BE KICKED OUT.

19:07.729 --> 19:08.605
- YOU.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.899
YOU WOULDN'T.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.611
- IF I CAN'T BE A BEE,
NOBODY CAN!

19:18.282 --> 19:23.036
- WOW, THE BEES HAVE REALLY
HELPED HIS SELF-CONFIDENCE.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.079
BEN, WAIT!

19:24.163 --> 19:25.289
LISTEN TO REASON.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.168
PLEASE, BEN.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.628
I'LL IRON YOUR COMIC BOOKS.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.880
I'LL BEDAZZLE YOUR RED WAGON.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.673
I EVEN FOUND SOMEONE
TO EAT YOUR STEAK FOR YOU

19:34.756 --> 19:35.549
IN THIS CONTEST.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.635
- [talking]

19:38.719 --> 19:41.680
- HAPPY, YOU ARE NOT
BENJAMIN HIGGENBOTTOM.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.349
THERE IS ONLY ONE
BENJAMIN HIGGENBOTTOM HERE,

19:44.433 --> 19:45.601
AND THAT'S HER.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.065
- [talking]

19:52.149 --> 19:55.027
- NO, YOU DON'T STILL GET
A STEAK.

19:55.110 --> 19:59.156
- HIGGENBOTTOM,
TIME TO EAT.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.748
[crowd cheering]

20:07.831 --> 20:09.625
- PUT HER IN A DOGGY BAG!

20:09.708 --> 20:10.584
all: 10, 9...

20:10.667 --> 20:12.711
8, 7...

20:12.794 --> 20:14.004
- I'M SORRY, BEN,

20:14.087 --> 20:15.339
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU EAT
MY HONEYBEE T-BONE.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.967
- HEY, THEY WEREN'T FINISHED
COUNTING DOWN.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.511
AND THAT'S MY T-BONE.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.680
[both growling]

20:32.439 --> 20:33.190
- YES!

20:33.273 --> 20:33.857
BACK IN MY OLD HONEYBEE DUDS.

20:33.941 --> 20:38.070
IN YOUR--WAIT A SEC.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.571
- I'LL SAVE YOU, BEN!

20:39.655 --> 20:41.657
UGH!

20:41.740 --> 20:42.908
MESSIE IS TOTALLY BEN.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.826
BEN IS TOTALLY MESSIE.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.620
EW!
I'M TOTALLY TELLING.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.914
- NO!

20:48.997 --> 20:51.041
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.960
THIS IS MY CAREER
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, PORTIA.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.336
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO HELP MY BROTHER.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.839
- HOLD IT, PORTIA.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.257
IF YOU TELL ON MY SISTER,

20:59.341 --> 21:04.179
THEN THE WHOLE WORLD WILL KNOW
THAT YOU HAD A CRUSH ON BESSIE.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.305
- [gasps]

21:05.389 --> 21:09.768
EVERYONE WILL KNOW
I HAD A CRUSH ON A NERD?

21:09.851 --> 21:10.602
GROSS!

21:10.686 --> 21:13.105
FORGET IT.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.607
- WOW, BEN.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.901
SOMEBODY'S READY
