WEBVTT

00:04.184 --> 00:05.905
This is Dante Bosco,
and you wouldn't believe

00:05.905 --> 00:07.854
what happened last week
on Blindspotting.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.045
Whoo!

00:12.145 --> 00:13.580
Yo, who's Mustafa?

00:13.580 --> 00:15.181
I was married in Bali.

00:15.281 --> 00:18.098
I became a stepmom
to his daughter, Tiarre.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.619
And we was a family.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.521
You said that he didn't
double down for you.

00:21.621 --> 00:22.756
It seems unhealthy.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.190
Well, I don't think
that healthy

00:24.290 --> 00:26.126
is your area
of expertise lately.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.028
- I'm Ashley.
- I'm Teena.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.662
My husband's doing
a bid out there.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.011
Same.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.632
It all goes downhill
from here.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.934
But I just wanted some of my
own time with my son.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.603
Can you just back off?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.238
Oh, my God. What a bitch.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.375
These are my tax returns
since 2010.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.910
I don't have any before this,

00:44.010 --> 00:45.145
but I think
the statute's passed.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.312
And they can't come after us

00:46.413 --> 00:49.315
for some shit I did in 1998.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.152
Uh, Mom...

00:52.252 --> 00:53.987
- Okay, this is--
- It has to be you.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.822
Trish can't handle
the paperwork.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.390
I'm not saying
you have to take over.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.659
I just want to catch you up
on the house,

00:59.759 --> 01:01.494
my life insurance, my will.

01:01.594 --> 01:04.397
These are my passwords
for my laptop,

01:04.497 --> 01:06.499
my phone, my e-banking logins.

01:06.599 --> 01:09.636
Oh, Mom,
why are your online passwords

01:09.736 --> 01:10.737
on a piece of paper?

01:10.837 --> 01:12.005
Security.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.640
That's not how that works.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.542
This is a little crazy.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.143
I'm in prison.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.279
I can't even keep
this stuff here.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.514
I know.
I just want you to be familiar,

01:21.614 --> 01:24.417
so you can be the point person
if something happens.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.487
You know who would make
a great point person?

01:28.721 --> 01:30.156
Ashley.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.591
She's gonna know
about all this anyway.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.226
We don't keep secrets
from each other.

01:33.326 --> 01:34.994
I mean,
why don't you just cut out

01:35.095 --> 01:36.496
the incarcerated middleman here

01:36.596 --> 01:38.465
and just go right to her, please?

01:38.565 --> 01:40.967
We're on a little bit
of thin ice, the two of us.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.002
One wrong word,
and I'm in danger

01:43.103 --> 01:44.637
of catching frostbite
in the living room.

01:44.737 --> 01:46.039
Frostbite? Really?

01:46.139 --> 01:47.841
I just don't want her
making decisions for me.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.143
Okay.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.525
Did something happen?

01:52.645 --> 01:53.680
Do you want me to talk to her
about it?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.014
No. No, no, no, no.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.951
I just want to enjoy
my visit with my son.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.420
It's never long enough.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.555
Well, why don't you come
to one of the weekend

02:02.655 --> 02:03.823
family visit things?

02:04.891 --> 02:06.092
Great. Yes.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.594
Okay, good. Yeah.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.729
Talk to, uh, Ashley about it.
She'll set it up.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.764
Just tell her you wanna come
the next time.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.032
Sure.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.334
Okay.

02:16.669 --> 02:17.871
Let's talk
about something else.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.205
Anything else. Great.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.809
Um, how is Nancy?

02:22.909 --> 02:24.477
Oh.

02:24.577 --> 02:28.648
You won't believe what she
has fucked around and done.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.326
Damn, Mama.

02:40.426 --> 02:42.128
You was watching
the Santeria documentaries

02:42.228 --> 02:43.429
again, wasn't you?

02:43.530 --> 02:44.864
Funny.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.599
You having a chill night in?

02:46.699 --> 02:49.102
No, I'm going to Luka's
with Ashley.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.938
Uh, why you got your old
keyboard in the kitchen?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.573
You should make it
a fancy night out.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.676
Get all dressed up,
and put on that nude lipstick

02:56.776 --> 02:59.846
you just bought--you know,
that nice kind of rouge color.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.214
The rouge color?

03:01.314 --> 03:02.081
Mama--
Yeah.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.116
No.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.117
Why? What for?

03:04.217 --> 03:05.285
It is Luka's.

03:05.385 --> 03:06.419
Well, you never know

03:06.519 --> 03:08.268
who you might bump into.

03:08.368 --> 03:11.424
I'm only going 'cause
that fucking Teena girl--

03:11.524 --> 03:12.292
yeah.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.826
She invited Ash.

03:13.826 --> 03:16.296
And you know Ash been on one,
drinking and shit,

03:16.396 --> 03:18.798
so I'm just going
to babysit her.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.714
I tried.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.051
Oh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

03:25.185 --> 03:26.506
Don't try to beat me
to the door.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.441
That's what it is.
You got a new man coming.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.609
Okay.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.524
Yeah, let me see

04:05.845 --> 04:08.281
Actually, they gave us
another slot for next weekend.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.383
Can't believe we got
a second one so quick.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.785
Do those say Oakland?

04:12.885 --> 04:13.853
Yup.

04:13.953 --> 04:15.054
I like these.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.023
Thank you.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.459
God, I haven't been here
in so long.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.027
My squad used to come here
all the time.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.595
Well, it's easy, cheap,

04:22.695 --> 04:24.197
and the niggas
are always thirsty,

04:24.297 --> 04:26.899
so we will never be.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.134
Fuck, it's cold out here.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.203
I was just trying to be cute.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.704
You really don't get out much,
do you?

04:31.704 --> 04:34.874
Yeah, well,
I spent 12 years with a man

04:34.974 --> 04:36.242
whose coat I could just steal.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.278
Mm. True.

04:40.126 --> 04:42.181
Damn,
of course Janelle is bailing.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.130
She came back from Bali
100 years old.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.385
Okay, well, fuck her.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.220
You got me, and I do go out.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.055
So just do as I do, bitch.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.723
A'ight.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.225
There that nigga is.
Come on.

04:52.325 --> 04:54.007
Huh?
- DNAS! Hey!

04:54.127 --> 04:55.995
Hey, what's good?
Hey, what's up, Teena?

04:56.095 --> 04:57.997
Hey, can we slide in?

04:58.097 --> 04:59.899
All right, but I don't want
no shit tonight, Teena.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.267
Nigga, come on.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.568
I don't want you gigging
on the bar.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.438
All right.

05:05.538 --> 05:06.973
All right, come on.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.041
- What?
- What?

05:10.209 --> 05:11.110
Sorry, y'all.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.745
Gentrifiers last.

05:12.845 --> 05:13.980
- Let's go.
- Okay.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.483
Eh-eh-eh.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.818
You thought
you about to get in here.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.186
Go back.

05:20.286 --> 05:22.088
Why are you here, Staf?

05:22.088 --> 05:23.389
I came to surprise you.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.026
Okay, and what would lead
you to believe that I

05:27.126 --> 05:29.095
wanted you to surprise me?

05:29.195 --> 05:31.097
You've been texting me
for weeks.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.666
You've been telling me
you miss me.

05:33.766 --> 05:34.834
You send nudies.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.236
What about my booty says,

05:37.337 --> 05:39.505
"Fly your ass
halfway across the world"?

05:39.605 --> 05:41.107
I mean, have you seen it?

05:41.207 --> 05:43.056
Stop.

05:43.176 --> 05:47.914
What it was saying was,
keep your lonely ass in Bali

05:48.014 --> 05:51.050
and never forget how
good you had it...

05:51.150 --> 05:53.720
and that I'm doing
better than you.

05:53.820 --> 05:57.590
I mean, it was nice,
how we were texting, right?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.806
Yeah.

05:59.926 --> 06:03.629
So maybe we can enjoy
each other while I'm here.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.667
See how that feels?

06:11.771 --> 06:13.639
The fuck?

06:13.740 --> 06:16.609
Not keeping up with your
martial arts training, I see.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.045
Shut up.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.060
I wasn't ready, obviously.

06:23.916 --> 06:27.367
These right here...

06:27.487 --> 06:30.890
best green tea candy in Bali.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.495
I missed these.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.896
I missed you.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.668
Um...

06:42.769 --> 06:45.204
What's all this about, huh?

06:45.304 --> 06:46.906
'Cause you ain't staying here.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.813
This is my Airbnb.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.814
You lying.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.048
Stafa.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.654
Shots all night.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.659
Ooh! Yikes. Okay.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.094
So anyway, bitch,
what I was saying--

07:08.194 --> 07:09.362
can we get two more? Mm-hmm.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.696
I was running at Dolores,
and this bitch

07:10.797 --> 07:12.532
thinks that she can pass me up.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.100
I'ma start placing
the 200, bitch.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.668
Let me tell you right now.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.137
We like three snakes
in the Garden of Eden.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.640
Okay, sir, now you know
that makes no fucking sense.

07:20.740 --> 07:21.974
Just stop. Okay.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.210
It wouldn't be proper
of me to pass you by

07:24.310 --> 07:26.879
without a proper hello.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.781
Not proper at all.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.017
- We're married.
- Hell, yeah!

07:31.117 --> 07:32.418
No, not to each other.

07:32.518 --> 07:33.853
- Stop. Stop.
- Oh.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.254
They here?

07:35.354 --> 07:36.456
Hey, yo, uh, Pops.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.890
Listen up now, man.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.625
Yeah, come on, man.
Leave them be.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.160
Damn.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.308
Sorry, young blood.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.729
Sorry, pale young blood.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.231
I didn't realize
they was yours.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.480
Carry on.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.902
So I guess you owe me
a drink now, huh?

07:50.002 --> 07:51.170
Wait, what was that?

07:51.270 --> 07:52.872
I said, you owe me a drink.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.774
I let you say you could pull
me, so where's my drink?

07:54.874 --> 07:55.842
All right, come on,
I got you.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.443
Okay. Go ahead.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.145
- No. Oh.
- Oh.

07:59.245 --> 08:01.047
Hi.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.949
- Oh.
- Ah... hello.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.385
Hey, listen, um, look,
my friend dragged me here.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.154
He wants to make sure
I have some fun,

08:08.254 --> 08:10.256
but I'm not great at this.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.326
Can I buy you a drink?

08:13.426 --> 08:15.161
Please?

08:15.261 --> 08:17.163
Sure. A Beautiful.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.798
Yes, you are.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.300
No, I'm talking
about the drink.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.336
- The what now?
- The- the drink?

08:23.436 --> 08:25.071
A Beautiful?

08:25.171 --> 08:28.207
Two parts Hennessy, one part
Grand Marnier, in a snifter.

08:28.307 --> 08:29.442
- All right.
- Warmed up.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.711
- You got it.
- And- and a cherry, please.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.646
Hey, can I get a Beautiful?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.915
With a-with a cherry.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.384
Oh, yay. Yay.
- Yay.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.153
No, you did not.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.955
She's too young to be
bringing boys home anyway.

08:43.055 --> 08:44.457
- Oh, my God.
- I had to at least scare him,

08:44.557 --> 08:46.325
you know.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.960
How was I supposed to know

08:48.060 --> 08:49.495
he didn't know
how to land properly?

08:49.595 --> 08:51.297
Staf, oh, my God.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.499
Ah, he'll be fine...

08:53.599 --> 08:54.967
in a few weeks.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.670
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

08:57.770 --> 09:01.140
- Ah, look at Ti.
- Aw.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.175
I miss Tiarre so much.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.216
She still talks
about you all the time.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.394
I don't get you, Staf.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.996
I was there.

09:24.096 --> 09:28.100
I was so ready
to make a life with you.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.773
Janelle, my daughter
barely got to know

09:33.873 --> 09:35.241
her mother before she died.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.078
I wasn't asking you
to let me replace her mother.

09:39.178 --> 09:42.748
I was asking for you to make
a new space for me.

09:42.848 --> 09:46.953
I was asking you to fight
for me in your life, for us.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.020
I-

09:52.191 --> 09:54.060
- Janelle.
- Don't.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.737
Your form was a bit wilder, no?

10:06.405 --> 10:07.573
No.

10:07.673 --> 10:10.323
My parries are fine, strong.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.280
Nah, it felt sluggish, slow...

10:14.380 --> 10:15.548
like you haven't been training.

10:15.648 --> 10:19.218
Oh, well,
big surprise there, huh?

10:19.318 --> 10:21.587
Nothing I do is enough.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.836
And let's be very clear.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.424
I'm as sharp as ever.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.662
You were always enough.
It wasn't that.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.230
No? What was it, then?

10:35.701 --> 10:37.336
I can't explain it.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.572
But it just hurt the first time
she called you "Mom."

10:39.672 --> 10:41.040
Well, I love her.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.142
I can't help
how she felt about me.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.644
I wasn't ready to hear her
call you that.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.679
I'm sorry.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.481
But I never thought you'd leave us.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.882
I had to leave.

10:49.982 --> 10:50.916
You were shutting me out

10:51.017 --> 10:53.586
and pretending
that you weren't.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.026
Are you okay?

11:00.126 --> 11:01.994
Oh. Okay.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.896
So hold up.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.932
What was your plan
with this grand gesture, huh?

11:07.033 --> 11:07.933
- What?
- 'Cause I noticed you

11:08.034 --> 11:09.168
didn't bring Tiarre with you.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.803
That means that you
came here to, what,

11:10.903 --> 11:12.905
to fuck and then
disappear again,

11:13.005 --> 11:15.207
or relive some shit
that I didn't already bury?

11:15.307 --> 11:16.709
No, that's not it.
That's not-that's not true.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.411
- No? No?
-"That's not true? No, no, no?"

11:18.511 --> 11:19.578
- That's not true?
- That's not it.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.881
Okay, then show me your visa.
Mm-hmm.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.482
'Cause if you staying here
longer than 30 days,

11:23.582 --> 11:25.217
you gonna need a visa, playboy.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.318
Where that's at?

11:33.592 --> 11:35.461
You're right.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.431
I didn't come to Oakland
to move here.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.233
I want you to come back
to Bali.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.969
Be my wife again.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.439
You said
I never fought for you.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.643
Well, here I am.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.411
I'm here to fight
for your love.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.352

12:03.322 --> 12:04.623
Hey. Y'all smoke?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.759
Oh, yes, God, please.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.360
I know it's a little fancy,
but--

12:08.461 --> 12:09.562
No, I could do fancy.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.529

12:15.234 --> 12:17.136

You can't stand here
and tell me

20:35.634 --> 20:37.069

that fucking shit.

20:37.169 --> 20:41.707
Nothing is ever the fucking
same after this shit, Ashley.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.142
You are just like me.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.079
You know what the fuck
we're doing here.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.894
You think I didn't
see you in there

20:49.014 --> 20:51.083

20:51.183 --> 20:52.684

20:52.784 --> 20:54.653
You came out here in that tight
ass dress

20:54.753 --> 20:56.955
thought you weren't gonna get
any attention.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.223
I know what you want.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.658
I know that you want this.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.627
You wanted hin to come and feel
up on you, didn't you?

21:13.005 --> 21:14.506

You wanna go to Caribbean City?

21:55.280 --> 21:58.317
What? Why? Now?

21:58.417 --> 22:02.287
Well, bitch, my night's

22:04.489 --> 22:07.392

- So friends fight, okay?

22:07.492 --> 22:09.061
Now I know I gotta back up

22:09.161 --> 22:11.463

22:11.563 --> 22:15.233
Girl, I gotta go home.

22:15.233 --> 22:16.802
You sure?

22:16.902 --> 22:19.738

22:49.968 --> 22:51.403
Every fucking day.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.040

You look cute but fucked up.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.204
Yes.

25:08.573 --> 25:10.542
Ooh, girl, is that Mustafa?

25:10.642 --> 25:12.110
Mm-hmm.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.379
He looks
more handsome in person.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.047
I like the facial hair.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.115
Okay. All right.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.483
Why don't you come on inside?

25:18.583 --> 25:20.552
No, no, no, no, no.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.488
I want to...

25:23.588 --> 25:25.557
- What? You what?
- mm...

25:28.093 --> 25:31.663
I just came to say
that I love you, Janelle.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.134
And I love you so much.

25:36.234 --> 25:37.068
Oh.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.470
Oh.

25:38.570 --> 25:39.638
Okay.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.473
I love you too.

25:41.573 --> 25:42.974
Uh-huh.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.442
Girl, he's cute.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.844
Mm-hmm.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.580
You should hold onto him
real tight.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.248
He is fine, ain't he?

25:50.348 --> 25:51.616
Yeah.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.084
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

25:53.184 --> 25:54.185
Yeah.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.353
I shouldn't be here.

25:55.453 --> 25:58.723
Okay, um, just act like...

25:58.823 --> 26:00.258
act like I wasn't here.

I'm a magic-I'm a magician.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.295
Shh.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.964
Shh, okay.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.934
Please text me
when you get home.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.001
Okay.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.006
Mm-mm.

26:16.374 --> 26:17.475
She seems nice.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.144
Mm-hmm.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.813
And has a great eye
for how handsome I am.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.515
Shut up.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.216
Give me my blunt.

26:36.861 --> 26:38.930
Hey, party girl.

26:39.030 --> 26:41.833
Wild night?

26:41.933 --> 26:43.602
Huh?

26:43.702 --> 26:47.205
Oh. Um, yeah.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.310
Is Sean asleep?

26:52.410 --> 26:54.112
Out like an adorable log.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.880
It looks like you lost
an earring.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.893
- Honey, are you--
- I can't.

27:08.994 --> 27:11.296
Um... I can't be around you
right now, Rainey.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.632
I'm sorry.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.667
Good night.

27:19.704 --> 27:21.840
And frostbite.
