That is, head up

Fine's not good enough.

lunch, but we're short a man.

happened to Will?

on the other side of that wall

06:12.706 --> 06:14.174
and look for ways
to exploit it.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.443

into doing that?

06:15.476 --> 06:16.677

with the Authority out there

07:11.331 --> 07:12.766

about that too?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.809
he prevented you
from going to Santa Monica

07:55.843 --> 07:58.612

13:04.551 --> 13:05.953
Hi, Teresa?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.320
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

13:07.354 --> 13:08.989
- I told those Redhats
yesterday,

13:09.022 --> 13:10.657
I broke up with Andy
a month ago.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.092
- I'm sorry to hear that.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.660
- Don't be.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.128
He was an asshole.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.065
- Soda?

13:20.067 --> 13:22.469
- I'm not thirsty.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.438
- Kids downstairs,
they...

13:25.472 --> 13:27.340
said Andy's
been around a lot lately.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.675
[top pops]

13:28.708 --> 13:31.178
At least until
that bomb went off.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.283
Oh, that's good.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.619
You know,
I'm only the advance team.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.488
Redhats are coming back soon
and they're gonna

13:41.521 --> 13:44.591
tear this building apart
brick by brick.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.362
Have a nice day.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.902
- How was the girlfriend?

13:54.902 --> 13:56.736
- [sighs]

13:56.769 --> 13:58.338
[engine turns]

14:01.741 --> 14:03.110
- Where are we going?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.711
- Around back.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.614
- Come on, you actually think
you flushed this dude out?

14:07.647 --> 14:11.418
- The hot girlfriend
doesn't have a good poker face.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.990
[overlapping chatter]

14:17.024 --> 14:18.525
And there he is.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.285
[radio chatter]

14:52.292 --> 14:54.494
- Teresa!

14:57.697 --> 14:59.732
- [grunts]

15:01.969 --> 15:03.403
Get against the wall!

15:03.436 --> 15:04.704
Hey!

15:05.973 --> 15:09.076
Get your ass back here!

15:10.110 --> 15:12.645
Oh, come on.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.293
- Aah!
Ohh...

15:33.266 --> 15:36.603
[people screaming]

16:00.160 --> 16:01.628
- Thanks for the backup.

16:01.661 --> 16:02.829
- Well, I pulled the car up.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.197
- Life lesson.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.066
When a guy has a gun
on you, don't run.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.202
- Man, he'd rather get shot
than go where he's going.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.505
- Get in there.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.777
[bass thrumming]

16:20.380 --> 16:22.515
- Did you call
that thing?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.051
- No.

16:57.684 --> 16:57.917
.

16:57.950 --> 16:58.618
- It took Mulholland six years

16:59.986 --> 17:01.554
and thousands of workers

17:01.588 --> 17:03.590
to bring the first water
to Los Angeles.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.726
We, meanwhile,
restored full service

17:06.759 --> 17:08.428
to every block in this colony

17:08.461 --> 17:11.098
with just the people here today.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.200
So, let us raise our glasses

17:13.233 --> 17:14.434
to a job well done.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.103
- Oh, my God.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.370
I'm so sorry.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.972
Um, let me, um--

17:20.006 --> 17:21.208
George?

17:21.241 --> 17:23.376
- Maddie?

17:23.410 --> 17:24.544
What are you doing here?

17:24.577 --> 17:27.747
- Oh, working.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.717
- I thought you and Rob
were in New York when--

17:30.750 --> 17:32.585
- He was.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.122
I stayed behind to help
with the gallery opening.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.656
And thank God.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.725
Otherwise, Hudson
would've been stuck here alone.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.593
- I can't believe I didn't know.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.563
I would've tried to find you.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.232
Do you still have the house?

17:45.265 --> 17:48.568
- I'm in Echo Park now.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.903
You living up here?

17:50.937 --> 17:52.305
- Yeah, yeah, I went from
the film distribution business

17:52.339 --> 17:53.740
to the water distribution
business.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.008
I'm third in command now
for Water and Power.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.810
- That's really great.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.612
I always knew
you were really talented.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.813
[giggles]

18:00.847 --> 18:02.549
So where do you live?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.384
- They gave me a great house
right up the canyon.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.819
- Yeah?
I'd love to see it sometime.

18:06.853 --> 18:07.987
- How about now?

18:08.020 --> 18:11.391
I could get you
out of here.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.897
- Holding cells are in back.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.432
Log him in,
and interrogations

18:19.466 --> 18:21.000
will come and get him
when they're ready.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.402
- We don't talk to him?

18:22.435 --> 18:25.405
- No.
That's a special department.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.808
- [sighs]

18:35.815 --> 18:37.384
- Move.

18:41.053 --> 18:44.357
- Carlos?

18:44.391 --> 18:48.261
- Will!

18:48.295 --> 18:50.363
- What happened?
- What do you think?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.299
Red Hats hit the garage
this morning.

18:52.332 --> 18:55.235
They killed Parko,
and they took me.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.070
All because of the fuel cells
that I helped you steal.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.972
What are you doing here?

19:00.006 --> 19:01.508
- There was an explosion.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.842
I got caught.

19:02.875 --> 19:06.213
They made me take a job
with the Occupation.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.548
My name is Will Bowman.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.350
Before everything,
I used to work for the FBI.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.652
- I thought you were my friend.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.120
- I am your friend.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.788
- Don't disrespect that word.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.290
It means something to me.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.125
- If I didn't take this job,
they were gonna send

19:19.226 --> 19:20.293
me and my family
to The Factory.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.229
- And what about my family?

19:22.262 --> 19:24.130
Lucia and Mateo
were in the trailer

19:24.231 --> 19:26.299
when the garage got hit.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.067
- [sighs]

19:28.100 --> 19:30.237
I'm gonna find out
what happened to them,

19:30.237 --> 19:31.438
and then I'm gonna
get you out of here.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.650
[knock at door]

19:43.683 --> 19:45.017
- Nicely done.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.553
I had a good feeling about you.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.688
- There's a mechanic
down in holding named Carlos.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.022
I need to get him
back out on the street.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.858
- It's a bit early for favors.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.025
- It's not a favor.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.394
If I'm gonna do
this job right,

19:54.427 --> 19:56.162
I need good CIs,
and Carlos is connected

19:56.263 --> 19:59.499
all over town.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.067
- Keep your radio on.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.570
I'm gonna need you back here
when the suspect breaks.

20:09.108 --> 20:12.078
[dramatic music]

20:12.111 --> 20:21.288
*

20:21.321 --> 20:26.293
[dog barks]

20:51.984 --> 20:53.586
- You stinker.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.555
I can't believe
you beat me again.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.290
Mommy's gotta up her game.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.892
- You just need to practice,
that's all.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.495
I play a lot
with Sarah at recess.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.896
Hey, Mom?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.665
- Yes?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.133
- Why can't I go to school
anymore?

21:07.166 --> 21:08.701
- Um...

21:08.735 --> 21:11.538
Because the government
is giving us a tutor.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.640
And that's gonna be
your new teacher.

21:13.673 --> 21:17.076
- Why?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.879
- Because Dad's got a new job

21:19.912 --> 21:21.881
working for people
in the government.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.350
And not everybody likes them.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.353
- Oh.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.888
Can Daddy's new job help us
get Charlie back?

21:28.921 --> 21:34.861
- I hope so, bear.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.496
That's the idea.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.930
Okay?

21:37.964 --> 21:41.067
[knock at door]

21:41.100 --> 21:42.602
- Who's that?

21:42.635 --> 21:44.036
- Nothing.

22:09.095 --> 22:09.396
.

22:09.396 --> 22:09.596
- Hey.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.401
Some people need our help.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.868
- Who?

22:15.902 --> 22:17.570
- It's a mother
and her son.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.772
The father was arrested
by the Occupation this morning

22:19.806 --> 22:23.443
and they gotta disappear.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.077
- This isn't
what we do, Katie.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.246
- Helping people
isn't what we do?

22:27.279 --> 22:28.915
If they get caught,
they go to The Factory.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.517
- I wish our resources
were unlimited.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.118
But they're not.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.421
Our goal is to end
this occupation.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.055
And if we want to
achieve that goal,

22:36.088 --> 22:37.924
it means making
some hard choices.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.191
Prioritizing.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.027
Listen, if you're
not ready to make

22:41.060 --> 22:43.029
the necessary sacrifices,
that's fine.

22:43.062 --> 22:46.899
But hey, just tell me
while I can still get you out.

22:46.933 --> 22:47.900
- I have already made
more sacrifices

22:47.934 --> 22:49.235
than you can imagine.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.203
My son is on the other side
of that wall

22:51.237 --> 22:53.272
and he's alone.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.908
So I am in this fight with you

22:55.942 --> 22:57.944
or without you.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.688
- George?

23:14.026 --> 23:15.828
Hey.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.698
- Hey.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.999
I packed you up
some stuff.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.300
I'm guessing
it's been a while

23:21.333 --> 23:23.202
since you had
wine and chocolate.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.805
- Ooh.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.373
So when can I
see you again?

23:32.479 --> 23:33.680
Oh.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.748
- [sighs]

23:35.782 --> 23:38.317
Look, you have to understand
my situation.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.820
You don't live
in the Green Zone, so...

23:40.853 --> 23:42.755
- So what?

23:42.789 --> 23:44.724
You think I can't
handle myself up here?

23:44.757 --> 23:46.693
- Well, of course you can.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.128
But there are
unwritten rules.

23:52.899 --> 23:56.503
I'm only third in command
at Water and Power.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.004
Maybe someday I'll be
in a better position.

23:58.037 --> 24:01.240
Right now,
I can't rock the boat.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.276
But...

24:04.310 --> 24:07.814
if you would be up for something
a little more discreet...

24:12.284 --> 24:14.220
- Your loss.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.101
- They arrested Carlos.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.103
We have to find
Lucia and Mateo.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.073
What?

24:37.243 --> 24:39.979
Hey, I'm so sorry.

24:40.012 --> 24:43.650
But I saw Carlos.
He's okay.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.686
- Where is he?
- He's with Homeland Security.

24:46.719 --> 24:47.954
- What's gonna happen to him?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.889
- I'll take care of it.

24:49.922 --> 24:53.292
But first, we gotta get you
out of here, okay?

24:53.325 --> 24:55.327
We need new IDs.

24:55.361 --> 24:57.830
- Sirak.

25:03.570 --> 25:07.940
[police siren wailing]

25:21.120 --> 25:24.123
- ID?

25:32.364 --> 25:33.633
[device beeps]

25:39.471 --> 25:41.641
I'm sorry, sir.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.075
You should've
said something.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.076
You need an escort?

25:44.110 --> 25:45.778
- No, I'm good.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.614
- Yes, sir.
Let him through, he's good.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.215
He's clear.
Let him go.

25:53.786 --> 25:57.957
- Jesus, what kind of ID
did they give you?

26:12.705 --> 26:13.773
- [on radio]
The orange line has been

26:13.806 --> 26:14.774

26:16.643 --> 26:18.277
[door opens]

26:18.310 --> 26:19.846
And now back
to the classical hour.

26:19.879 --> 26:22.448
Here's some Mozart.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.717
- Aha, welcome, my friends.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.253
It's good to see you.
It's been far too long.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.689
Ah, come, come back,
come back, come back.

26:29.722 --> 26:30.923
So what do you need?

26:30.957 --> 26:32.258
Will: IDs.
Woman and child.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.860
Latino.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.528
- These folks are awful
important to us, Sirak.

[classical music plays

*

26:43.069 --> 26:45.071
What's this?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.073
- When the Red Hats
remove photographs

26:47.106 --> 26:49.441
from the memorial walls,
sometimes a little mouse

26:49.475 --> 26:50.777
finds them
and brings them to me.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.111
- It's easier
to create an identity

26:52.144 --> 26:53.445
from a real person.

26:53.479 --> 26:54.446
- It's the next evolution.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.248
A step beyond

26:56.282 --> 26:57.750
what I was able to do
for you and your family.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.460
- So what about Carlos?

27:08.494 --> 27:10.562
- I'm trying to get him
flagged as an informant.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.464
But it's not up to me.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.466
- I thought you were
in charge.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.802
- Yeah.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.304
Snyder lied, of course.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.872
There's a woman
running the unit.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.741
- Who's she?

27:21.774 --> 27:23.810
- I don't know,
but I've seen her type before

27:23.843 --> 27:24.844
when I was deployed.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.379
Ex-CIA if I had to guess.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.315
- I thought the RAPs
killed all those people.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.517
- Yeah, I thought so too.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.886
She's the real deal.

27:36.055 --> 27:39.892
- Okay, um, what does she
have you working on?

27:39.926 --> 27:43.730
- The bombing that almost
killed me.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.497
We're making progress.

27:45.531 --> 27:49.001
I caught the bastard that
put the bomb on the truck.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.037
I'm gonna use him.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.504
Work my way up the food chain.

27:52.538 --> 27:54.907
Find Geronimo.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.443
And then we get Charlie back.

28:06.585 --> 28:06.819
.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.087
[knock at door]

28:19.598 --> 28:20.833
- Hey.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.304
- Where are your parents?

28:25.337 --> 28:26.906
- Out.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.042
Which, according to my mom
makes me the man of the house.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.879
Why don't you go upstairs?

28:32.912 --> 28:35.247
- Why?
- 'Cause Pia and I have to talk.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.415
But we'll come play
Chutes and Ladders

28:36.448 --> 28:37.683
with you in a minute.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.790
- For you.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.092
- Is this some kind
of anniversary?

28:46.125 --> 28:48.795
- No, I just wanted
to get you something.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.999
- Thanks.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.605
These are Sennheisers.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.107
How'd you get them?

29:01.140 --> 29:04.176
- Let's just say
I have a source.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.345
- I can't take these, Pia.

29:06.378 --> 29:10.149
They're super expensive.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.683
- Don't worry about it.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.389
- Remember, this is
only temporary.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.391
As soon as your new IDs
are uploaded into the system,

29:19.425 --> 29:20.860
we can move you
somewhere on the grid.

29:23.729 --> 29:26.065
- Come.
I have a space for you.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.610
- We can't stay here.

29:38.644 --> 29:41.047
- Hey, Will?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.181
Is this safe?

29:42.214 --> 29:43.549
- Nothing's gonna happen.

29:43.582 --> 29:47.186
Everyone here knows
I run this place.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.055
Katie:
You'll be okay.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.557
You be good.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.870
- I gotta go deal with Carlos.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.604
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you at home.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.639
Hey.

30:07.673 --> 30:10.776
I love you, okay?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.412
- I love you too.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.403
- I'm sorry we couldn't help
your friends.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.972
Participation in a cause
like ours can be tough.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.408
Especially for people
with close family and friends.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.510
They have the most to lose.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.079
- I'm doing this
for my family.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.348
When this is over,
however it ends,

30:49.381 --> 30:50.749
I will not be
one of those mothers

30:50.782 --> 30:52.084
who has to look
her children in the eye

30:52.118 --> 30:53.552
and tell them
that she did nothing.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.095
- I understand
you have some information

31:03.129 --> 31:06.432
on the gateway bombing.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.567
- The Occupation
arrested the man

31:08.600 --> 31:12.238
who loaded the bomb
onto the truck.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.340
And they're
gonna use him

31:14.373 --> 31:15.942
to roll up
the rest of the cell.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.410
- The people responsible
for that action

31:18.444 --> 31:20.579
used to be affiliated with us,

31:20.612 --> 31:22.949
but they splintered off

31:22.949 --> 31:28.454
when we discovered that
we had a difference of, um...

31:28.487 --> 31:30.189
philosophy.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.191
- But they know who you are.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.360
- That's why we need
to help them hide

31:34.393 --> 31:35.761
before it's too late.

31:38.764 --> 31:42.068
I know we're already
asking a lot of you.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.470
But you came to us
at a critical moment.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.072
Geronimo needs every soldier

31:46.105 --> 31:48.240
loyal to the cause
ready and willing to fight.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.876
- You have contact with him?

31:50.977 --> 31:53.579
- We're close to executing

31:53.612 --> 31:56.248
an operation that will
do meaningful damage.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.085
Should we be fortunate,
we might even uncover secrets

31:59.118 --> 32:00.752
that will give us
a fighting chance

32:00.786 --> 32:03.489
to end the Occupation itself.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.993
But if this other cell
is captured,

32:06.993 --> 32:12.531
everything we worked for
will be at risk.

32:35.487 --> 32:35.721
.

32:35.754 --> 32:36.688
- What happened to the prisoners
that were in here?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.791
- Factory.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.867
- They sent Carlos,
my CI, to The Factory.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.669
I told you that I need him.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.304
- Close the door.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.612
You have a chance to do well
here, don't be naive.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.381
- We're talking about
someone's life.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.950
- Lots of decisions will always
be made above our heads.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.319
That's just how it is.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.325
- How do you live with this job?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.697
- By focusing
on the big picture.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.100
Have people already forgotten
The Arrival?

33:21.133 --> 33:24.570
Every defense mechanism
in this city

33:24.603 --> 33:26.972
was wiped out
within eight hours.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.375
Do you really think
a handful of guerrillas

33:29.408 --> 33:32.078
is gonna make a difference
against them?

33:32.111 --> 33:35.081
All they're gonna do
is take more innocent lives

33:35.114 --> 33:39.418
and ensure that conditions
in this block get much worse.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.327
The buses haven't left yet
for The Factory.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.096
I can probably hold them
for a minute or two.

33:50.096 --> 33:53.099
[dramatic music]

33:53.099 --> 34:01.107
*

34:12.451 --> 34:15.221
- Lucia and Mateo are safe.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.789
No one will ever find them.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.864
I'm sorry, Carlos.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.666
- Well, then,
everything's fine.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.902
As long as your kids
still have their father, right?

34:33.972 --> 34:35.574
- We have to leave, sir.

34:35.607 --> 34:43.615
*

34:54.226 --> 34:58.029
[siren wailing]

34:58.063 --> 35:01.267
[drones whirring]

35:29.695 --> 35:31.863
- I couldn't get Carlos out.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.700
- That's not your fault.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.802
- Yeah, it is.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.871
- No, he helped you
because he was your friend.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.207
And because he knows
you would've done

35:41.207 --> 35:43.942
the same for him.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.980
Come on.

35:49.014 --> 35:51.983
*

35:52.017 --> 35:56.555
Please look at me.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.225
We live in a moment where
we do what we have to do

35:59.225 --> 36:04.230
for the people that we love.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.398
The old rules
just don't apply.

36:06.432 --> 36:10.736
- I'm a collaborator, Katie.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.471
What the hell am I doing?

36:12.504 --> 36:16.007
- You are protecting
our family.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.028
- Yeah?

36:37.062 --> 36:39.531
- Yeah, suspect broke
about ten minutes ago.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.667
Meet us where La Cienega
runs into the Wall.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.670
- 10/4.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.642
I'm sorry.

36:50.676 --> 36:55.447
Looks like it's gonna be
another late one.

36:55.481 --> 36:56.848
- Be safe.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.406
[phone rings]
- Yeah?

37:20.439 --> 37:21.940

where his friend

37:21.973 --> 37:23.375
has been keeping those, uh,

37:23.409 --> 37:24.976
those parts that you wanted,

37:25.010 --> 37:25.977
and he's headed over there
right now.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.212
- You have an address?

37:27.313 --> 37:29.381
- Where La Cienega
meets the Wall.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.383
Does that mean anything to you?

37:40.326 --> 37:40.592

man: Copy that.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.997
- What do you got?

39:59.030 --> 40:01.232

his instructions

40:01.266 --> 40:02.501
from this dead drop.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.069
- Who are those guys?

40:04.102 --> 40:07.839
- Uh, the sergeant here
thinks they rolled up the cell.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.508
- Does it seem likely
to you

40:09.541 --> 40:10.776
that the guys
that hit the gateway

40:10.809 --> 40:12.110
would be dumb enough
to be hanging out

40:12.143 --> 40:13.879
right next to their own
dead drop?

40:13.912 --> 40:16.081
- Hell, no.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.116
This is it.
