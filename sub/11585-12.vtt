(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.770 --> 00:05.673
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.109
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.142 --> 00:09.777
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:09.810 --> 00:11.545
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.579 --> 00:13.614
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.084
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.489
LET YOUR CHI FLOW.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.558
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER
THE NEXT FORM?

00:24.592 --> 00:26.294
BODY IN WATER.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.829
NO, SNAKE CREEPS DOWN.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.800
NO, I MEAN THERE'S A BODY
IN THE WATER!

00:36.404 --> 00:38.439
(Warner)
NO I.D.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.175
CSU FOUND A PURSE
50 YARDS DOWN THE BANK,

00:41.209 --> 00:42.443
BUT IT WAS WASHED CLEAN,

00:42.476 --> 00:44.378
ALONG WITH ANY FLUIDS
ON THE BODY.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.479
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHEN SHE WENT IN?

00:45.513 --> 00:47.481
NO SIGN THE FISH FED ON HER,

00:47.515 --> 00:48.782
SO SHE COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN IN LONG.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.118
LONG ENOUGH
TO GET RID OF ANYTHING

00:50.151 --> 00:51.352
THAT'S GONNA HELP US.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.254
EVEN THE RIVER
COULDN'T GET RID OF THIS.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.722
SHE BLED
FROM HER WOUNDS,

00:54.755 --> 00:56.324
WHICH MEANS
HER HEART WAS PUMPING,

00:56.357 --> 00:59.093
AND SHE WAS ALIVE
WHEN SHE SUSTAINED THEM.

00:59.127 --> 01:02.430
HEAD BASHED IN,
PUNCTURE WOUNDS TO THE BREASTS.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.098
(Benson)
SHE'S GOT SCARS
ALL OVER HER.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.200
SOMEBODY'S BEEN
WORKING HER OVER FOR A WHILE.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.436
(Stabler)
HALF NAKED, JEWELRY...

01:08.469 --> 01:09.770
TRICK GONE WRONG?

01:09.803 --> 01:12.140
OR ANGRY PIMP SYNDROME.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.407
(Stabler)
THAT'S A TRI-BAR CROSS.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.508
RUSSIAN ORTHODOX.

01:14.542 --> 01:18.246
SHE WAS BEATEN AND TORTURED,
SHE STILL BELIEVED IN GOD.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.480
YOU'D THINK HE
COULD HAVE PROTECTED HER

01:19.513 --> 01:22.516
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.204
ANY CLOSER
ON THE I.D.?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.371
NO HIT ON HER PRINTS

02:17.405 --> 02:19.273
AND MISSING PERSONS
CAME UP EMPTY.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.809
BUT I CAN TELL YOU SHE'S
14 YEARS AND TWO MONTHS OLD.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.178
I CARBON DATED

02:24.212 --> 02:25.479
THE CRYSTALLINE PROTEINS
IN HER EYES.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.480
SHE'S JUST A KID.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.649
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT KILLED HER?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.451
THERE'S NO WATER IN HER LUNGS,
SO SHE WAS DEAD

02:30.484 --> 02:31.885
BEFORE SHE WENT
IN THE RIVER.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.755
PROBABLY FROM ONE
OF THE FOUR BLOWS TO HER HEAD.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.190
ANY OTHER INJURIES?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.459
TOO MANY.
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

02:38.492 --> 02:43.231
THIS WRIST WAS FRACTURED
AND SET WITH A PIN.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.799
SCAR TISSUE TO THE SHOULDER
SUGGEST MULTIPLE DISLOCATIONS.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.501
OLD CIGARETTE BURNS?

02:47.535 --> 02:49.570
YEAH.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.505
THE ONLY RECENT INJURIES
ARE THE WOUNDS TO THE HEAD,

02:51.539 --> 02:53.374
AND THE PUNCTURES
TO THE BREASTS.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.575
WELL, SHE HAD SURGERY
ON HER WRISTS,

02:54.608 --> 02:56.744
SO SOME DOCTOR
KNOWS WHO SHE IS.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.279
GOOD LUCK
TRYING TO FIND HIM.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.881
I RAN AN ISOTOPE ANALYSIS
OF HER HAIR.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.517
IT MEASURES OXYGEN INTAKE
FROM DRINKING WATER,

03:03.551 --> 03:06.387
WHICH VARIES
FROM GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.523
THE MOST RECENT GROWTH SHOWS
THAT SHE'S BEEN IN NEW YORK

03:09.557 --> 03:12.460
THE PAST
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.495
BEFORE THAT, DISTINCT MARKERS
PUT HER IN THE UKRAINE.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.529
(Benson)
YOUNG EASTERN EUROPEAN GIRL,

03:15.563 --> 03:18.699
SEVERE ABUSE,
WOUNDS TO THE BREASTS,

03:18.732 --> 03:20.268
SHE WAS TRAFFICKED
FOR SEX.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.402
LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER GIRLS
SMUGGLED IN HERE

03:21.435 --> 03:22.770
WITH PHONY PAPERS.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.871
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH
TO I.D. HER.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.807
I KNOW A WOMAN WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO BETTER YOUR ODDS.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.443
SHE RUNS AN ORGANIZATION
THAT HELPS TRAFFICKED GIRLS.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.545
HER NAME'S
GRACE METCALF.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.484
(Metcalf)
I DON'T RECOGNIZE HER,

03:36.517 --> 03:37.751
BUT SO FEW GIRLS ESCAPE,

03:37.785 --> 03:39.019
AND ONLY A PORTION
OF THOSE MAKE IT TO ME.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.588
WE BELIEVE
SHE'S FROM THE UKRAINE.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.524
KIEV TO NEW YORK
IS A MAJOR TRAFFICKING CORRIDOR.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.626
AND OTHER COUNTRIES
IN THE FORMER EASTERN BLOC

03:45.659 --> 03:47.261
ARE CLOSE BEHIND.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.962
THE ECONOMY STINKS, AND THESE
GIRLS HAVE VERY FEW OPTIONS.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.931
SO ENTER THE TRAFFICKERS
WITH PROMISES OF GLAMOUR

03:50.964 --> 03:52.566
AND BIG MONEY ABROAD.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.435
WHAT THEY GET
IS A LIFE IN HELL.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.769
NAOMI,

03:55.803 --> 03:57.538
ABDUCTED
FROM A PLAYGROUND.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.808
RISA, DRUGGED AT A NIGHTCLUB
AND FLOWN OUT THE SAME NIGHT.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.911
ANNA, HER MOTHER SOLD HER
AND HER LITTLE SISTER

04:03.944 --> 04:05.446
FOR 50 EUROS.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.980
YOU GOT NAMES ON ANY
OF THESE PRICKS?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.582
FOUR AND FIVE APIECE.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.384
THEY CHANGE IDENTITIES
LIKE YOU CHANGE UNDERWEAR.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.685
WHAT ABOUT OTHER GIRLS
FROM THE UKRAINE,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.854
ANYONE THAT OUR VICTIM
MAY HAVE ARRIVED WITH?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.357
LAST SUMMER,
WE HELPED A GIRL FROM KIEV.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.558
PULLED HER OUT OF A BROTHEL
IN QUEENS.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.892
SHE STILL LIVE HERE
IN THE CITY?

04:18.926 --> 04:20.561
I WOULDN'T CALL IT "LIVING."

04:20.594 --> 04:21.729
SHE'S TOO ASHAMED
TO GO BACK HOME,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.497
AND WORRIED
IF HER TRAFFICKERS FIND HER,

04:23.531 --> 04:24.632
THEY'LL KILL HER.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.567
LOOK, THE PEOPLE THAT
WE'RE AFTER MAY BE THE SAME ONES

04:26.600 --> 04:27.968
THAT PIMPED
THAT GIRL OUT.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.004
SO WHEN WE GET 'EM,
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO HIDE.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.410
HER NAME'S
VERONICA PANKOVICH.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.613
SHE WORKS IN A LAUNDRY
ON 36th STREET.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.650
PRETENDS SHE
DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

04:42.683 --> 04:46.286
VERONICA?

04:50.424 --> 04:51.759
VERONICA.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.828
I'M DETECTIVE
OLIVIA BENSON.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.664
[speaking Russian]

04:56.697 --> 04:58.065
[sighs]

04:58.098 --> 04:59.333
VERONICA,

04:59.367 --> 05:01.068
LISTEN TO ME,
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.103
I KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME.
I JUST WANNA TALK, OKAY?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.339
I HAVE TO FINISH MY WORK.

05:05.373 --> 05:09.343
GRACE METCALF SENT ME.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.380
IS THERE SOME PLACE
THAT WE CAN TALK PRIVATELY?

05:14.782 --> 05:17.518
YOU FOUND ME,
SO THEY CAN TOO.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.452
WE'RE GONNA BE GONE
IN A MINUTE.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.621
NOBODY'S GONNA EVER KNOW
THAT WE WERE HERE.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.624
NOW, DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GIRL?
SHE'S FROM KIEV, LIKE YOU.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.793
I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.395
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.763
NO, NO, YOU CAN, BY TELLING US
WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.399
HE'LL FIND OUT.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.700
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ONE OF THOSE WOMEN INSIDE

05:32.733 --> 05:34.468
WON'T TELL HIM?

05:34.502 --> 05:36.504
HE'S GOT PEOPLE
WATCHING EVERYWHERE.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.039
AND WHEN HE FINDS ME,
I WILL DIE.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.173
LOOK, IF YOU TELL US
WHO HE IS,

05:40.207 --> 05:43.844
WE'LL HAVE VICTIM SERVICES
RELOCATE YOU TO ANOTHER CITY.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.582
HIS NAME IS ALIK.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.118
HE SMUGGLED ME IN
AND MADE ME A PROSTITUTE.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.620
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE LIVES?

05:52.653 --> 05:55.389
WHERE HE HANGS OUT?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.790
I HAVE HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.592
BUT HE'LL NEVER SPEAK
TO A COP.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.576
CLAUDIA?

06:15.609 --> 06:16.777
HELLO, ALIK.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.079
PLEASE SIT.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.449
LET'S TALK.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.050
LIKE I SAID ON THE PHONE.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.954
I NEED EIGHT GIRLS,
NEWCOMERS.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.055
THE YOUNGER,
THE BETTER.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.823
I MEAN LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOU.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.125
OH.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.628
CHICAGO.
MM.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.796
LOTS OF PRETTY GIRLS THERE.

06:35.829 --> 06:36.930
YES, INDEED.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.166
CAN'T YOU SHOP AT HOME?

06:39.199 --> 06:42.135
I HAVE VERY IMPORTANT CLIENTS
THAT COME HERE FOR WORK.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.471
I NEED
TO SERVICE THEM LOCALLY.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.706
FLY YOUR GIRLS IN.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.808
TOO RISKY.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.678
HALF MY GIRLS
DON'T EVEN HAVE PASSPORTS.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.514
AND MY CLIENTS
LIKE VARIETY.

06:53.547 --> 06:57.217
WHO GAVE YOU
MY PHONE NUMBER?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.552
ONE OF YOUR GIRLS
WAS IN TOWN.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.655
I MET HER.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.658
SHE TOLD ME
TO PHONE YOU.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.928
ARE YOU INTERESTED
OR NOT?

07:17.705 --> 07:20.708
I MIGHT KNOW SOME GIRLS
LOOKING FOR WORK.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.479
(Benson)
OPEN UP.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.715
[Alik speaking Russian]

07:29.917 --> 07:31.519
OKAY.

07:31.552 --> 07:35.188
(Alik)
THEY'RE CLEAN.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.657
THIS ONE'S TEETH
ARE A ROTTEN MESS.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.258
YOU GOTTA GET
OFF THE METH, HONEY.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.560
NO SALE.

07:39.593 --> 07:43.063
YOU THINK I LET
MY GIRLS SHOOT UP?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.097
NOT IN THEIR ARMS.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.769
AH.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.070
BETWEEN THEIR TOES, MAYBE.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.173
DUE DILIGENCE.
I RESPECT THAT.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.975
I'LL TAKE
THE FIRST TWO.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.143
(Alik)
10,000.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.679
(Benson)
EIGHT.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.648
I STILL NEED
SIX CLEAN GIRLS.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.050
GIVE ME ANOTHER 8,000,
I'LL DELIVER THEM TOMORROW.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.986
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.188
NYPD, NOBODY MOVE.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.591
PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.125
IT'S OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
SOMEPLACE SAFE.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.194
YOU GOIN' DOWNTOWN.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.897
BITCH, YOU ARE DEAD!

08:16.930 --> 08:18.031
[screams]

08:18.065 --> 08:18.899
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.801
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.102
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

08:22.135 --> 08:22.970
IN A COURT OF LAW.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.872
THOSE GIRLS ARE FRIENDS
OF MY FAMILY.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.139
AND YOU BROUGHT THEM HERE

08:26.173 --> 08:28.208
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SUCH A NICE GUY, HUH?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.644
SO THEY CAN LIVE
AMERICAN DREAM.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.013
I'M HELPING THEM
FIND JOBS.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.582
LIKE YOU HELPED
THIS GIRL?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.185
WASN'T ME.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.688
I'VE BEEN IN MIAMI ALL WEEK.
I FLEW BACK THIS MORNING.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.056
CHECK MY TICKET AND HOTEL.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.191
WERE YOU JUST TROLLING
SOUTH BEACH

08:44.224 --> 08:45.225
FOR MORE GIRLS
TO RUIN THEIR LIVES?

08:45.258 --> 08:48.261
YOU MAKE IT
SEEM SO TRAGIC.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.897
THEIR LIVES
AREN'T TERRIBLE.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.298
SO WHAT DO YOU CALL
DAILY BEATINGS?

08:51.331 --> 08:54.802
RAPE?
EXPOSURE TO HIV?

08:54.835 --> 08:55.769
"THE GOOD LIFE"?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.805
YOU THINK THEY'RE BETTER OFF
IN THE UKRAINE?

08:57.838 --> 08:59.807
ROTTING THEIR LIVERS
ON GRAIN ALCOHOL,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.042
TRADING SEX FOR DRUGS?

09:02.075 --> 09:05.979
I GIVE THEM NICE CLOTHES,
DECENT FOOD, A PLACE TO STAY.

09:06.013 --> 09:10.751
WELL, YOU GAVE HER
A LOVELY DEATH.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.186
SHE DIDN'T DESERVE
DIE LIKE THAT.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.054
AW, THAT'S SWEET.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.656
WHAT WAS SHE,
ONE OF YOUR SPECIAL GIRLS?

09:15.689 --> 09:16.824
SHE WASN'T
ONE OF MINE.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.792
BUT I DO KNOW HER.

09:18.826 --> 09:19.960
SO WHO WAS SHE?

09:19.993 --> 09:23.664
WE NEED
AN ARRANGEMENT FIRST.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.765
COUGH UP A NAME.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.200
[coughs and wheezes]

09:27.234 --> 09:28.936
[laughs]
NOPE, NOTHING.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.303
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

09:30.337 --> 09:34.041
BUT YOUR BALLS
ARE IN A VISE RIGHT NOW, PAL.

09:34.074 --> 09:38.245
I DON'T DO
AMERICAN TIME.

09:38.278 --> 09:43.884
I GET DEPORTED TO THE UKRAINE.
SERVE MY SENTENCE THERE.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.286
HE'LL DO A FEW WEEKS,
BUY HIS WAY OUT,

09:46.319 --> 09:48.789
AND BE BACK TRAFFICKING
MORE GIRLS.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.691
WE'LL GIVE INTERPOL
OUR FILE.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.760
PUT HIM ON EVERY
INTERNATIONAL WATCH LIST.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.294
THAT'LL AT LEAST
SLOW HIM DOWN.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.229
GIVING HIM A DEAL
SHOWS WE'RE SOFT.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.901
AND NOT FINDING THE KILLER
MAKES US INCOMPETENT.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.840
[laughs]

10:06.874 --> 10:08.008
THE BOSS LADY.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.143
SAVE THE GRIN,
ASS WIPE.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.845
THERE'S NO DEAL
UNLESS THE NAME CHECKS OUT

10:11.879 --> 10:12.846
AND YOUR ALIBI HOLDS UP.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.748
IT WILL.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.885
WHAT'S HER NAME?

10:17.918 --> 10:20.353
ELSA LYCHKOFF.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.856
(Benson)
YOUR FRIENDS
PIMP HER OUT?

10:22.890 --> 10:24.658
SHE WASN'T WHORE.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.226
SHE WAS
A GOOD KID.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.762
SO HOW'S A PIECE OF CRAP
LIKE YOU KNOW HER?

10:28.796 --> 10:31.799
BECAUSE SHE WAS
IN THE UKRAINIAN NEWSPAPER.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.302
ONE OF THOSE
GENIUS MATH KIDS.

10:35.335 --> 10:40.874
ALWAYS WINNING AWARDS
AND GETTING HER PICTURE TAKEN.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.110
SAD.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.412
(Elsa)
I ALWAYS DREAMED

10:45.445 --> 10:47.915
OF WINNING THE BRADSHAW PRIZE
FOR APPLIED MATHEMATICS.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.918
MY PAPER ON DENSE TRIANGLE-FREE
GRAPH CONJECTURE

10:50.951 --> 10:52.853
HAS MADE MY DREAM
COME TRUE.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.287
(Stabler)
ELSA LYCHKOFF,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.189
YOUNGEST WINNER EVER.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.826
AND SHE'S SMARTER
THAN ALL OF US COMBINED.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.861
ANY MENTION
OF THE PROUD PARENTS?
NO.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.263
BUT THIS ONE SAYS THAT SHE WENT
TO THE MOREWOOD SCHOOL.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.898
NEVER HEARD OF IT.
I HAVE.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.333
PLACE IS A GENIUS FACTORY.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.001
COUPLE OF BRAINIACS
FROM MY OLD 'HOOD

11:08.035 --> 11:09.136
GOT SHIPPED OFF THERE.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.303
KIND OF LIKE
AN ELITE SPORTS ACADEMY?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.305
YEAH, BUT THE KIDS THEY TAKE
NEVER COME HOME.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.907
WHERE DO THEY GO?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.843
M.I.T., HARVARD, CAL TECH.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.811
SO HOW DID MOREWOOD'S
TOP PUPIL

11:17.845 --> 11:19.813
WIND UP AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE RIVER?

11:19.847 --> 11:23.416
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING MOMENT
OF MY LIFE.

11:23.450 --> 11:27.054
[applause]

11:30.157 --> 11:31.258
THIS IS A TRAGEDY.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.492
ELSA WAS ONE
OF OUR BRIGHTEST STUDENTS.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.027
MY SOURCE AT M.I.T.
JUST TOLD ME

11:34.061 --> 11:35.495
SHE WAS ABOUT
TO BE ACCEPTED THERE.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.865
HOW LONG HAS
SHE ATTENDED MOREWOOD?
ONE YEAR.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.301
OUR FORENSICS SHOW THAT SHE WAS
IN THE UKRAINE SIX MONTHS AGO.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.003
FOR AN EXTENDED
FAMILY TRIP

11:43.036 --> 11:44.805
TO VISIT
A DYING GRANDMOTHER.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.874
ELSA'S A U.S. CITIZEN.
SHE WAS BORN HERE.

11:46.907 --> 11:47.975
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
WHY HER PRINTS

11:48.008 --> 11:49.376
WEREN'T ON FILE
AT IMMIGRATION.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.244
HAVE YOU TOLD HER PARENTS?
NOT YET.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.280
WE'RE GONNA NEED
THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.882
OF COURSE.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.249
WAS ELSA
LIVING AT HOME?

11:56.283 --> 11:58.952
NO, OUR STUDENTS
BOARD HERE.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.888
AND NO ONE NOTICED
THAT SHE WAS MISSING?

12:00.921 --> 12:01.822
SHE WASN'T.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.157
AFTER ELSA FINISHED TAKING
HER LAST MIDTERM,

12:04.191 --> 12:06.226
SHE SIGNED HERSELF OUT
FOR THE WEEKEND.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.527
WHAT TIME
DID SHE LEAVE?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.096
UM...

12:10.931 --> 12:12.766
NOON, SATURDAY.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.068
SHE WAS DUE BACK TONIGHT.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.136
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT HER PARENTS?

12:16.169 --> 12:19.773
MR. AND MRS. LYCHKOFF
ARE EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.942
THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS
OF A CHILD AS GIFTED AS ELSA.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.044
DID THEY KNOW
THAT SHE HAD A BROKEN WRIST,

12:24.077 --> 12:25.813
AND WAS BURNED
BY CIGARETTES?

12:25.846 --> 12:28.115
ARE YOU INSINUATING
THAT HAPPENED AT MOREWOOD?

12:28.148 --> 12:29.282
ANY TEACHERS
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HER?

12:29.316 --> 12:30.417
SHE OUTPACES
A FEW OF THEM

12:30.450 --> 12:33.821
INTELLECTUALLY,
BUT THERE'S NO ANIMOSITY.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.488
AND HOW ABOUT SOME
OF YOUR OTHER STAR PUPILS?

12:35.522 --> 12:36.890
ANY HARD FEELINGS THERE?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.091
OUR STUDENTS
MAY BE COMPETITIVE,

12:38.125 --> 12:40.828
BUT THEY'RE RUTHLESSLY LOYAL
TO ONE ANOTHER.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.930
ELSA HAVE ANY LOYAL FRIENDS
WE COULD TALK TO?

12:42.963 --> 12:47.234
SHE WAS VERY CLOSE
TO HER ROOMMATE JENNIFER BANKS.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.136
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.039
WAS ELSA UPSET
BY ANYTHING RECENTLY?

12:52.072 --> 12:53.406
YOU KNOW,
FIGHTING WITH ANYONE?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.876
NO, SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.077
ANY PROBLEMS
WITH TEACHERS?

12:57.110 --> 13:00.380
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THEY ALL LOVE HER.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.083
SHE WAS THE SMARTEST KID
IN CLASS,

13:03.116 --> 13:04.217
EVEN AFTER
SHE STOPPED STUDYING.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.585
STOPPED?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.320
EVERYTHING CAME EASY
TO ELSA.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.089
SHE DIDN'T TAKE NOTES,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.091
AND SHE DIDN'T CRAM ALL NIGHT
LIKE THE REST OF US.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.259
SPEND HER TIME
PLAYING CHESS?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.261
I DO.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.597
I'M NINE POINTS AWAY
FROM CANDIDATE MASTER.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.299
THE SCHOOL HIRED
TWO GRAND MASTERS TO COACH ME.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.068
(Benson)
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.103
SO IF ELSA WASN'T SPENDING
HER TIME STUDYING,

13:23.136 --> 13:24.237
WHAT WAS SHE DOING?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.975
I DON'T KNOW.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.010
TELL ME, JENNIFER.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.614
SHE'D SNEAK OUT
AT NIGHT.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.217
SHE HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.952
NO, BUT, UH,
SHE FLIRTED A LOT.

13:38.986 --> 13:39.953
WITH WHO?

13:39.987 --> 13:40.954
NOT ANYONE HERE
AT SCHOOL.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.322
THEN WHERE?

13:42.355 --> 13:45.926
SHE WOULDN'T LET ME
GO OUT WITH HER.

13:45.959 --> 13:49.229
SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
SEEING HER BE BAD.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.263
BAD?
HOW?

13:52.966 --> 13:55.002
WHEN SHE SNUCK OUT,
SHE DRESSED KIND OF SLUTTY.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.469
WILL YOU SHOW ME?

14:12.219 --> 14:16.957
LEATHER PANTS,
THONG, CORSET.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.125
SHE DIDN'T WEAR
THAT STUFF TO CLASS.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.060
WE HAVE A DRESS CODE.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.196
SHE'D GET DEMERITS
JUST FOR HAVING IT.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.331
AND IF HER DAD
FOUND OUT--

14:24.364 --> 14:26.099
DID MR. LYCHKOFF
EVER HURT HER?

14:26.133 --> 14:28.235
ELSA WOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT IT.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.203
BUT WHEN SHE CHANGED,

14:30.237 --> 14:33.040
I COULD SEE SCARS
AND BURNS ON HER SKIN.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.644
(Joseph)
WHO DID THIS?
HAVE YOU FOUND THEM?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.146
(Stabler)
WE'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.349
MY ELSA.
SHE HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.417
HOW COULD SHE HAVE
BEEN STOLEN FROM ME?

14:44.451 --> 14:46.386
(Benson)
SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND ELSA
WERE VERY CLOSE.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.988
ONLY I UNDERSTOOD HER.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.689
SHE WAS A PRODIGY LIKE ME.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.259
I WAS RECRUITED FROM UKRAINE
TO BE AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER

14:52.292 --> 14:54.127
HERE IN THE STATES.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.195
IF YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
WHO UNDERSTOOD HER,

14:55.228 --> 14:56.296
WHY DID YOU SEND HER AWAY?

14:56.329 --> 14:59.366
MOREWOOD WAS THE BEST PLACE
FOR ELSA.

14:59.399 --> 15:04.137
A SUPERIOR INTELLECT DOES NOT
COME AROUND VERY OFTEN.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.339
SO--SO ELSA'S GIFT
HAD TO BE NOURISHED

15:06.373 --> 15:10.177
BY EXPERTS ONLY.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.246
MOTHERS,
THEY CUDDLE TOO MUCH.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.684
SHE STUDIED SO HARD.
SHE NEEDS A MOTHER'S CARE.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.220
MAYBE IF WE KEPT HER
AT HOME.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.356
SHE NEEDED A DISCIPLINE.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.659
WHAT, LIKE BEING JERKED SO HARD
THAT HER SHOULDER DISLOCATED?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.428
OR BEING BURNED
BY CIGARETTES?

15:28.461 --> 15:29.963
(Benson)
LIKE FINDING OUT SHE WAS
SNEAKING AWAY FROM SCHOOL,

15:29.997 --> 15:30.998
SO YOU DISCIPLINE HER?

15:31.031 --> 15:31.999
I NEVER RAISED
A HAND TO HER!

15:32.032 --> 15:34.467
SOMEBODY SURE AS HELL DID.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.038
MRS. LYCHKOFF...

15:40.173 --> 15:44.277
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO WOULD HURT YOUR DAUGHTER?

15:47.047 --> 15:49.182
NO.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.984
I LOVE ELSA.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.986
SHE WAS ALL I LIVE FOR!

15:53.020 --> 15:54.421
STOP WASTING MY TIME

15:54.454 --> 15:58.158
AND FIND THE BASTARD
WHO KILLED MY SHINING STAR!

15:58.191 --> 16:01.294
I GUESS HE NEEDED A SHINING STAR
AFTER HE CRASHED AND BURNED.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.164
LYCHKOFF GOT FIRED BY BOEING
AFTER SIX MONTHS,

16:04.197 --> 16:06.066
THEN HIRED BY LOCKHEED.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.700
AND THEY DUMPED HIS ASS
FOUR MONTHS LATER.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.637
SOUNDS LIKE OUR GENIUS
IS ONE DUMB SON OF A BITCH.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.072
HOW DOES HE
MAKE ENDS MEET?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.573
INSURANCE SCAMS,
PONZI SCHEMES.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.408
HE HAS 13 OPEN CASES
AGAINST HIM.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.177
MOST OF THEM
ARE FOR FRAUD.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.311
ANYTHING VIOLENT?

16:18.345 --> 16:19.179
NO, BUT HE'S GOT
BANK LIENS UP THE WAZOO.

16:19.212 --> 16:22.149
HE'S INTO THE IRS
FOR A HUNDRED GRAND.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.450
THAT COULD DRIVE SOMEONE
OVER THE EDGE.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.252
TORTURING
YOUR ONLY CHILD?

16:25.285 --> 16:26.619
HE TORTURED
BOTH OF US.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.656
I'M KATRINA LYCHKOFF,

16:29.689 --> 16:32.325
ELSA'S OLDER SISTER.

16:32.359 --> 16:35.195
THE ONE MY FATHER
THREW AWAY.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.765
HE SAID "GET WITH THE PROGRAM
OR GET OUT."

16:38.798 --> 16:40.633
WHAT WAS THE PROGRAM?

16:40.667 --> 16:44.771
UNWAVERING DEDICATION
TO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY

16:44.804 --> 16:46.373
FROM THE MOMENT
WE WERE BORN.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.676
AND ACADEMICS
WEREN'T REALLY YOUR THING?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.344
MY IQ IS 135.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.480
THAT'S REALLY HIGH.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.049
NOT HIGH ENOUGH
FOR MY FATHER.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.052
ELSA'S WAS 165.
THAT'S EINSTEIN TERRITORY.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.220
I'M SURE YOU
DIDN'T COME HERE TO TELL US

17:00.253 --> 17:01.288
HOW SMART
YOUR SISTER IS.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.424
ELSA DIED AFTER SHE LEFT SCHOOL
TO VISIT MY PARENTS.

17:04.457 --> 17:08.795
AND YOU THINK YOUR FATHER
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.266
THERE WAS A PLACE IN OUR HOUSE
WHERE HE USED TO TEACH US.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.168
I DIDN'T SEE
A CLASSROOM.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.603
NO ONE'S EVER SEEN IT
BUT US.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.771
I COULD SHOW YOU.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.108
MY MOM CALLED ME AT WORK.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.576
SHE SAID THEY WERE GOING
TO THE FUNERAL HOME.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.514
IT'S LIKE
AN ICEBOX IN HERE.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.082
THAT'S FUNNY,

17:29.116 --> 17:31.118
'CAUSE MY DAD
CALLED IT "HOTHOUSING."

17:31.151 --> 17:35.255
GIFTED CHILDREN NEEDED DEVOTED
CARE AND ATTENTION TO GROW.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.225
LIKE RAISING AN ORCHID
IN A HOT HOUSE TO MAKE IT GROW.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.259
YEAH.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.495
ELSA WAS PAPA'S
EXOTIC FLOWER.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.698
SHE NEEDED DEVOTED CARE
AND ATTENTION TO FLOURISH.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.434
IT'S HARD TO FLOURISH
WITHOUT HEAT.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.170
COLD STIMULATES THE MIND.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.640
IT WAS ONE OF MY DAD'S
PEDAGOGICAL TECHNIQUES.

17:53.673 --> 17:57.377
[as Mr. Lychkoff]
TWO LINES ARE PERPENDICULAR
IF AND ONLY IF

17:57.410 --> 17:59.346
THE PRODUCT
OF THEIR SLOPE

17:59.379 --> 18:01.448
IS A NEGATIVE ONE!

18:01.481 --> 18:04.417
I LEARNED THAT
ON MY SIXTH BIRTHDAY.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.423
(Stabler)
WHAT'S WITH THE RICE?

18:10.457 --> 18:11.824
DID HE FORCE YOU
TO EAT DOWN HERE TOO?

18:11.858 --> 18:12.792
NO.

18:12.825 --> 18:16.763
HE MADE US KNEEL ON IT
WHILE HE DRILLED US.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.332
IT'S NOT SO BAD AT FIRST.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.133
BUT AFTER A WHILE,

18:20.167 --> 18:21.601
THE GRAINS DIG
INTO YOUR SKIN

18:21.634 --> 18:23.736
AND YOU START TO BLEED.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.905
(Benson)
HOW LONG DID YOU
GO TO SCHOOL DOWN HERE?

18:25.938 --> 18:28.408
TILL I WAS 16.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.277
LAST YEAR, HE KICKED ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.712
HE WANTED TO SPEND
ALL HIS TIME WITH ELSA.

18:32.745 --> 18:37.317
HE SAID SHE HAD
TRUE POTENTIAL.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.885
HE WAS RIGHT.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.921
THE ONLY JOB I COULD GET
WAS WAITRESSING.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.291
BECAUSE YOU WERE
A TEENAGER,

18:44.324 --> 18:45.792
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A CHANCE

18:45.825 --> 18:46.893
TO GO
TO COLLEGE.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.828
OR SAVE MY SISTER.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.564
I WANTED TO TAKE HER
AWAY FROM PAPA.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.566
BUT MOREWOOD
IS JUST AS BAD.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.834
THE PRESSURE
IS TOO INTENSE.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.869
WE HEARD THAT THINGS
CAME EASY TO HER.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.771
NO, THE PRESSURE
TO MAKE MONEY.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.607
HOLD ON,
ELSA HAD TO WORK TOO?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.942
MOREWOOD PAID MY FATHER
TO ENROLL HER.

19:02.975 --> 19:03.943
YOU MEAN THEY GAVE HER
A SCHOLARSHIP?

19:03.976 --> 19:04.944
YEAH...

19:04.977 --> 19:07.314
ALONG WITH A HUGE BONUS
FOR SENDING HER THERE.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.416
HE ALSO ENTERED HER
IN COMPETITIONS

19:09.449 --> 19:10.450
FOR THE PRIZE MONEY.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.484
SHE WAS
THE FAMILY CASH COW.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.619
[footsteps thudding]

19:12.652 --> 19:14.487
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.189
[gasps]
KATRINA!

19:16.223 --> 19:17.457
SHE IS DEAD TO US.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.358
YOU'RE TRESPASSING
ON MY PROPERTY.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.193
I AM PRESSING CHARGES
AGAINST YOU.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.561
ME FIRST.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.430
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR ASSAULTING ELSA LYCHKOFF.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.665
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.933
YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT,
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN

19:26.966 --> 19:28.468
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.403
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.838
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD ONE,

19:31.871 --> 19:34.474
ONE WILL BE
APPOINTED TO YOU.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.542
(Joseph)
I WOULD NEVER HURT ELSA.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.444
SHE WAS MY PRIDE AND JOY.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.379
TILL SHE MISSED
A MATH PROBLEM.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.881
AND THEN YOU BEAT HER LIKE A
MULE THAT WOULDN'T PULL A PLOW.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.350
THIS IS HOW I WAS TAUGHT.

19:43.383 --> 19:47.820
AND IT WORKED,
I EARNED MY PhD AT 23.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.223
HE FAILED HIS EXAMS

19:50.257 --> 19:53.626
AND WAS KICKED OUT
OF UNIVERSITY.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.462
AND THEN WE MOVED TO U.S.,

19:55.495 --> 19:58.531
AND HE STARTED LOOKING
FOR JOBS,

19:58.565 --> 20:01.368
TELLING EVERYONE
HE HAVE HIS DEGREE.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.271
LIV, HAMMER HIM
ON HIS PhD.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.372
HE NEVER GOT IT.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.274
YOU SURE YOU HAVE
THAT PhD?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.776
'CAUSE WE DID SOME CHECKING,

20:09.809 --> 20:11.311
AND THERE'S
NO RECORD OF IT.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.846
I AM A VERY SMART MAN.
YOU'RE A LIAR.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.548
AND YOU'RE LYING
ABOUT BEATING

20:15.582 --> 20:16.616
THE CRAP
OUT OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.285
NO, I LOVE HER!

20:18.318 --> 20:20.553
AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER
DAUGHTER THAT YOU KICKED OUT

20:20.587 --> 20:22.021
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T
A GENIUS, HUH?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.623
DO YOU LOVE HER TOO?

20:23.656 --> 20:26.393
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.660
KATRINA WOULD NEVER SUCCEED.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.696
I COULDN'T WASTE
ANY MORE TIME ON HER.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.865
HE WAS ALWAYS
GETTING FIRED

20:32.899 --> 20:36.969
AND GOING TO CASINO
TO PLAY CARDS.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.971
LOSING ALL OUR MONEY.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.608
WHAT'D YOU LIVE ON?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.543
I CLEAN OFFICES.

20:43.576 --> 20:47.580
ONE JOB,
AND THEN TWO JOBS.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.749
LIV, HE'S A GAMBLER.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.484
YOU LET YOUR WIFE
BREAK HER BACK

20:51.518 --> 20:53.353
WHILE YOU WERE LIVING IT UP
IN ATLANTIC CITY.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.855
YEAH, I COUNT CARDS.
IT'S EASY MONEY.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.390
THAT'S IF YOU'RE GOOD
AT IT.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.560
YOU LOST 80 GRAND AT BLACKJACK
IN THE LAST YEAR.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.296
THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED ELSA
AT MOREWOOD.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.064
THEIR STIPENDS WOULD HELP YOU
COVER YOUR GAMBLING LOSSES.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.567
I ONLY CARED
FOR MY DAUGHTER'S WELL-BEING.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.768
AND HOW'S THAT?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.337
BY BEATING HER
TILL SHE BLED?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.004
I NEVER HURT HER!

21:12.038 --> 21:14.941
I SAW THE BRUISES.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.476
THE CIGARETTE BURNS.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.545
DID YOU CONFRONT HIM?

21:18.578 --> 21:22.715
NO, HE SAID HE WAS DOING
WHAT WAS BEST FOR HER.

21:22.749 --> 21:27.554
AND SHE WAS LEARNING.
HER TEST SCORES PROVED IT.

21:27.587 --> 21:31.491
I LET HIM DO IT.

21:31.524 --> 21:36.095
I LET HIM HURT
MY BABY.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.464
I ONLY WANTED
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.031
OH, COME ON.
SHE'S YOUR MEAL TICKET.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.367
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT WHO SHE IS,

21:40.400 --> 21:41.501
WHAT SHE WANTS.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.602
YOU JUST RIDE HER.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.670
GETTING HER
INTO THE BEST SCHOOLS,

21:43.703 --> 21:44.737
HONING HER

21:44.771 --> 21:46.939
INTO DADDY'S PERFECT
LITTLE GENIUS.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.508
YES, YES, YES,
I DID THIS, YES.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.042
BUT YOU RODE HER
TOO HARD, DIDN'T YOU?

21:50.076 --> 21:51.644
AND SHE STARTED
ACTING UP.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.613
SHE STARTED NEGLECTING
HER STUDIES,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.515
SNEAKING OUT
OF HER SCHOOL.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.516
SO YOU CONFRONTED HER.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.518
RIGHT, YOU TRIED KNOCKING
SOME SENSE INTO HER?

21:58.551 --> 21:59.719
I'M SORRY.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.121
SO YOU BEAT HER
TO DEATH.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.492
AND YOU DUMPED
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER'S BODY

22:05.525 --> 22:06.292
INTO THE RIVER.
GOD FORGIVE ME!

22:06.325 --> 22:07.660
SIT BACK DOWN, JOSEPH.
SIT DOWN!

22:07.694 --> 22:09.662
FORGIVE ME!
ELSA!

22:09.696 --> 22:10.697
STOP IT!
ELSA!

22:10.730 --> 22:12.131
JOSEPH, STOP IT!
ELSA!

22:12.164 --> 22:13.633
FORGIVE ME!
CAPTAIN!

22:16.536 --> 22:19.406
SOMEBODY CALL A BUS!

22:26.613 --> 22:28.881
HAVE THE HOSPITAL CALL US
WHEN HE'S CONSCIOUS.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.917
WHAT IF HE SAVES US ALL
THE TROUBLE AND CROAKS?

22:30.950 --> 22:33.386
WE STILL NEED A FORMAL
CONFESSION TO CLOSE THE CASE.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.754
WE NEED TO FIND THE PERP
TO DO THAT.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.889
I CALLED THE CASINOS
DOWN IN A.C.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.492
A COUPLE OF PIT BOSSES SAY
LYCHKOFF'S A REGULAR.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.927
THEY SENT
HIS SURVEILLANCE PHOTO.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.430
HE WAS THERE
THE DAY ELSA WAS MURDERED.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.632
BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT TIME
THAT ELSA WAS KILLED.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.467
HE WAS GLUED TO THE TABLES
FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.602
GUY'S A CREEP,
HE'S JUST NOT OUR CREEP.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.538
THIS GUYS MUST HAVE FELT
PRETTY GUILTY

22:51.571 --> 22:52.705
ABOUT THE ABUSE
HE PUT ELSA THROUGH

22:52.739 --> 22:53.806
TO BASH HIS HEAD IN
LIKE THAT.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.074
SO DAD'S OFF THE HOOK.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.976
I GUESS WE TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SCHOOL.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.111
WELL, NOT EVERY STAR PUPIL THERE
SHINES SO BRIGHT.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.581
START WITH THESE THREE
RAP SHEETS.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.717
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.819
KID GETS AN "A"
FOR "ARSON."

23:10.723 --> 23:12.725
[liquid pouring]

23:15.061 --> 23:18.698
YOU BURNED DOWN A GARAGE.
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU BURNED?

23:18.731 --> 23:20.733
I WAS WORKING
ON A CHEMISTRY EXPERIMENT.

23:20.767 --> 23:21.934
I KNOCKED OVER
A BUNSEN BURNER.

23:21.968 --> 23:25.071
WELL, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID
THAT ACCELERANT WAS USED.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.606
DUH.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.775
I NEED THEM TO MAKE
THE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

23:28.808 --> 23:30.777
I USE IN MY RESEARCH.

23:30.810 --> 23:34.614
I'M NOT SOME LITTLE KID
PLAYING PYRO HERE.

23:34.647 --> 23:38.217
I ALREADY HAVE
THREE PATENTS ON MY WORK.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.153
I'M GOING TO HARVARD
IN THE FALL.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.822
BREAKING AND ENTERING.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.857
ARMED ROBBERY.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.759
THAT'LL IMPRESS
THE ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.462
IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.764
I MEAN, COLLEGES WON'T FIND OUT
BECAUSE I WAS NEVER CONVICTED.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.700
YOU ROBBED
A GAS STATION.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.234
MY OLDER BROTHER DID.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.670
I ONLY TAGGED ALONG TO PROVE
THAT I WASN'T A NERD.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.939
IT'S CALLED
ACCESSORY TO A CRIME.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.608
ONCE I REALIZED
WHAT HE WAS DOING,

24:01.641 --> 24:03.776
I RAN
OUT OF THE GAS STATION.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.644
AND THE D.A. BELIEVED THAT?

24:04.677 --> 24:06.779
I GUESS SO.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.048
HE MADE A DEAL
WITH MY PARENTS

24:09.081 --> 24:10.850
TO SEND ME HERE.

24:10.883 --> 24:15.054
BECAUSE THIS PLACE
IS LIKE A JAIL.

24:15.087 --> 24:15.922
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.657
WHAT DO YOU CALL RAPE TWO,
FUN AND GAMES?

24:17.690 --> 24:18.758
THERE WASN'T
ANY RAPE.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.660
THERE WASN'T EVEN
ANY SEX.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.730
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T BELIEVE
I WAS GONNA BE HER BOYFRIEND.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.733
I TOLD HER IT WAS ONE AND DONE,
AND SHE FLIPPED OUT.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.569
SO YOU FIGURED A PUNCH
IN THE FACE WOULD CALM HER DOWN?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.704
I PUSHED HER AWAY.

24:31.738 --> 24:34.073
SHE FELL AND HIT HER HEAD
ON THE BEDPOST.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.275
SHE WAS JUST PISSED AT ME
THAT I REJECTED HER,

24:36.308 --> 24:37.810
SO SHE CALLED THE COPS.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.680
OKAY, ELSA LYCHKOFF.
SHE ONE OF YOUR ONE AND DONES?

24:40.713 --> 24:41.814
NO WAY.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.716
GIRLS AROUND HERE
ARE SO WRAPPED UP

24:43.750 --> 24:44.784
IN THEIR OWN HEADS,

24:44.817 --> 24:46.653
THEY GOT NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THEIR BODIES.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.655
BUT STILL, A GUY
AS HANDSOME AS YOU,

24:48.688 --> 24:50.890
YOU SURE
SHE WASN'T INTERESTED?

24:50.923 --> 24:52.291
ELSA WAS
INTO OLDER DUDES.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.760
HOW MUCH OLDER?

24:53.793 --> 24:56.696
NOT PERVY OLD,
LIKE YOU.

24:56.729 --> 24:57.830
SHE USED TO HANG OUT
WITH THIS GUY

24:57.864 --> 24:58.865
THAT WENT TO SCHOOL HERE.

24:58.898 --> 24:59.932
I THINK HE LIVES
IN NEWARK NOW.

24:59.966 --> 25:03.035
NAME?
DANNY BURKE.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.170
YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.772
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN LITTLE GIRLS.

25:05.805 --> 25:06.573
I'M 23.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.741
ELSA WAS 14.
THAT MAKES HER JAILBAIT.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.176
LOOK, I MET HER
AT A PARTY.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.778
SHE SAID THAT SHE WENT
TO MOREWOOD

25:11.811 --> 25:13.245
AND THAT
SHE WAS REALLY UNHAPPY.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.214
AND YOU OFFERED TO MAKE HER
FEEL ALL BETTER, HUH?

25:15.247 --> 25:16.716
NOT THAT WAY.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.117
I WAS LIKE
A BIG BROTHER.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.318
SOMEONE SHE
COULD LOOK UP TO.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.319
QUITE THE ROLE MODEL.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.555
GIVING UP A PROMISING FUTURE
FOR A DEAD-END LIFE

25:22.589 --> 25:23.823
IN THIS DUMP?

25:23.856 --> 25:26.025
YEAH, BUT IT'S MY DUMP.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.594
I'M NOT GONNA LIVE
MY LIFE

25:27.627 --> 25:29.696
THE WAY THOSE A-HOLES
AT MOREWOOD WANT ME TO.

25:29.729 --> 25:30.863
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE OLD
TO BE REBELLING

25:30.897 --> 25:32.264
AGAINST YOUR HIGH SCHOOL?

25:32.298 --> 25:34.333
BE THE BEST.
GREAT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.835
MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.970
THEY EVEN FEED
THEIR STUDENTS
[Theremin drones]

25:38.004 --> 25:40.807
A SPECIAL DIET
TO INCREASE BRAIN ACTIVITY.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.309
OMEGA 3'S
AND ALL THAT CRAP.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.410
THAT PLACE
IS TOXIC.

25:44.443 --> 25:46.613
IS THAT WHY YOU DROPPED OUT
A MONTH BEFORE GRADUATING?

25:46.646 --> 25:47.680
I COULDN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.

25:47.714 --> 25:48.681
AND NEITHER COULD ELSA.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.651
SHE WANTED TO BE A KID,
NOT THEIR F'ING ROBOT.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.753
SHE HATED MOREWOOD.
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.922
LIKE THROUGH HER WINDOW,
DRESSED LIKE A SLUT?

25:55.955 --> 25:58.157
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:58.190 --> 26:00.359
WE SAW HER CLOTHES.
LEATHER AND LACE.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.861
YOU GOT THE WRONG GIRL.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.030
ELSA WOULDN'T EVEN
WEAR MAKEUP.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.298
YOU KNOW
HER ROOMMATE JENNIFER?
YEAH.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.867
ELSA HATED
THAT LITTLE BITCH.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.669
MOMMY COULD BUY
HER ADMISSION TO MOREWOOD,

26:09.702 --> 26:11.804
BUT SHE COULDN'T BUY
ELSA'S BRAINS.

26:11.838 --> 26:12.905
SO SHE WAS JEALOUS
OF ELSA?

26:12.939 --> 26:14.073
PATHOLOGICALLY.

26:14.106 --> 26:17.810
JENNIFER KEPT BEGGING ELSA
TO TANK ONE EXAM, JUST ONE,

26:17.844 --> 26:19.245
SO THAT JENNIFER
COULD BE NUMBER ONE.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.881
AND ELSA WOULDN'T?

26:21.914 --> 26:23.616
IT WAS WORLD WAR THREE
IN THEIR ROOM.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.151
ELSA ASKED
FOR A NEW ROOMMATE.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.854
AND WHEN THE NAZI HEADMISTRESS
SAID NO,

26:27.887 --> 26:29.956
ELSA GAVE JENNIFER
THE SILENT TREATMENT.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.058
AND HOW DID
JENNIFER REACT?

26:32.091 --> 26:34.827
DID YOU EVER SEE
A NERD SPAZ OUT?

26:34.861 --> 26:36.929
IT'S UGLY.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.231
[Theremin whirring]

26:39.265 --> 26:42.401
JENNIFER.
JUST A MINUTE.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.804
YOU LIED
ABOUT THE CLOTHES.

26:44.837 --> 26:45.872
THEY'RE YOURS,
AREN'T THEY?

26:45.905 --> 26:46.739
WHAT, THEY WERE
FROM HALLOWEEN.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.407
ELSA LIKED THEM,
SO I LET HER WEAR THEM.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.909
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

26:49.942 --> 26:50.843
(Stabler)
BUT SHE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND.

26:50.877 --> 26:53.379
AND ELSA NEVER WOULD HAVE WORN
THOSE CLOTHES.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.648
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
DANNY BURKE.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.950
HE'S A PREVARICATOR.
SYNONYM FOR LIAR.

26:57.984 --> 26:58.685
HEY.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.253
THIS ISN'T
A VOCABULARY TEST.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.656
ELSA WAS MURDERED.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.325
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS, OKAY?

27:06.358 --> 27:07.960
THEY PUT ME
IN A TOURNAMENT NEXT WEEK,

27:07.994 --> 27:09.796
AND I NEED TO STUDY
MOLNAR-NAGY 1966.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.899
I'M IN ZUGZWANG,
BUT IF I COULD SOLVE IT--

27:12.932 --> 27:15.935
MAYBE IT'S H-7
TO G-6.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.837
HEY, THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS

27:17.870 --> 27:20.006
IS BY TALKING TO US.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.911
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
TO ELSA.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.022
I WANT MY MOM.

27:37.957 --> 27:41.861
I'M SUZANNE BANKS,
JENNIFER'S MOM.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.096
WHY IS SHE ALONE
IN THERE?

27:44.130 --> 27:45.464
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO HER?

27:45.497 --> 27:47.867
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DID SHE DO
TO HER ROOMMATE?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.902
ELSA?

27:49.936 --> 27:52.271
THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.673
WEREN'T THEY?

27:56.876 --> 27:57.877
I'M GLAD SHE'S DEAD.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.046
DON'T SAY
SUCH A THING.
WHY NOT?

28:00.079 --> 28:02.381
IT'S THE TRUTH.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.050
ELSA GOT ALL THE ATTENTION.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.953
SHE WAS IN THE NEWSPAPER,
SHE HAD SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.388
SWEETIE, YOU HAVE
A COLLEGE FUND.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.990
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.058
IT'S ABOUT THE COMPETITION.
BEING THE BEST.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.392
THERE IS NO SECOND PLACE.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.861
THAT'S WHY THE SCHOOL
ROOMED US TOGETHER.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.495
SO WE'D PUSH
EACH OTHER.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.030
BUT ELSA ALWAYS CAME OUT
ON TOP.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.499
IT WASN'T FAIR.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.269
SHE NEVER STUDIED,
AND I WORKED SO HARD.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.071
BUT SHE WAS SMARTER
THAN ME.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.172
BABY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.907
IT IS TRUE, MOM.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.909
I'M SMART,
BUT SHE'S A GENIUS.

28:29.942 --> 28:30.943
AND SHE NEVER LET ME
FORGET IT.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.278
WAS SHE MEAN TO YOU?

28:32.311 --> 28:33.312
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TALK
TO ME.

28:33.345 --> 28:34.446
NOT A WORD.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.015
LIKE, I WAS TOO INSIGNIFICANT,

28:36.048 --> 28:37.483
TOO STUPID TO WASTE
HER BREATH ON.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.518
OH, BABY--
I'M NOT A BABY!

28:39.551 --> 28:41.888
AND I'M NOT STUPID!
I JUST WANTED TO BE THE BEST.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.123
YOU JUST COULDN'T BEAT HER.
IT WASN'T FAIR!

28:44.156 --> 28:46.793
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO
TO M.I.T.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.895
SHE WAS GOING TO DROP OUT
LIKE THAT LOSER DANNY.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.763
SO WHY COULDN'T SHE
LET ME WIN, HUH?

28:50.797 --> 28:53.032
JUST ONCE, SO THAT I COULD BE
THE SMARTEST GIRL AT MOREWOOD.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.867
THEN EVERY COLLEGE
WOULD WANT ME.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.002
DID YOU EVER SAY THIS
TO ELSA?

28:56.035 --> 28:58.404
I TOLD YOU
SHE WOULDN'T SPEAK TO ME.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.106
SO I FOLLOWED HER
ONTO THE FERRY ONE DAY

29:00.139 --> 29:01.273
WHEN SHE WENT
TO SEE DANNY,

29:01.307 --> 29:02.408
BUT SHE COULDN'T
RUN AWAY FROM ME

29:02.441 --> 29:03.542
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE HUDSON RIVER.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.011
JENNIFER, THAT'S ENOUGH.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.846
I THINK WE BETTER GO NOW.

29:06.879 --> 29:07.880
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!

29:07.914 --> 29:09.015
NO! DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.817
I'M SICK AND TIRED

29:10.850 --> 29:12.919
OF EVERYONE ALWAYS TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO,

29:12.952 --> 29:15.187
WHAT TO SAY,
HOW TO THINK, HOW TO ACT.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.323
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO HER,
THAT'S ALL.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.991
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO HER,

29:19.025 --> 29:20.192
AND THEN TAKE
THE NEXT FERRY BACK.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.161
BUT SHE SCREAMED AT ME.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.229
WHY WAS I FOLLOWING HER?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.030
SHE CALLED ME A LOSER.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.933
SHE SAID
I WAS PATHETIC, AND DUMB,

29:26.966 --> 29:29.568
AND THAT I WAS ONLY AT MOREWOOD
BECAUSE MY FAMILY IS RICH.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.237
THAT I'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT ON BRAINS ALONE,

29:31.270 --> 29:32.839
LIKE HER.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.007
SHE TRIED WALKING AWAY,
AND SO I GRABBED HER ARM,

29:35.041 --> 29:36.342
AND SHE PUSHED ME.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.010
SO I JABBED HER CHEST
WITH MY PEN,

29:38.044 --> 29:40.012
AND SHE PUSHED ME AGAIN.
JENNIFER, STOP!

29:40.046 --> 29:40.947
AND SO I PULLED HER HAIR

29:40.980 --> 29:42.915
AND I SLAMMED HER HEAD
INTO THE RAILING,

29:42.949 --> 29:45.584
OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.
[kicking table]

29:45.617 --> 29:50.089
[sobbing]

29:53.926 --> 29:55.494
DID ANYBODY SEE YOU FIGHTING?

29:58.530 --> 30:02.501
EVERYONE WAS INSIDE
BECAUSE IT WAS RAINING.

30:02.534 --> 30:05.037
SHE TRIED SCREAMING
FOR HELP,

30:05.071 --> 30:07.073
BUT NO ONE COULD HEAR HER
BECAUSE THE FERRY HORN

30:07.106 --> 30:09.075
STARTED TO BLOW.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.144
THAT'S WHEN SHE FELL DOWN,
AND I PUSHED HER INTO THE RIVER.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.520
I'M NUMBER ONE NOW, MOM.

30:21.553 --> 30:25.992
AREN'T YOU HAPPY FOR ME?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.271
SHE MADE
A FULL CONFESSION.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.439
(Greylek)
AND HER MOTHER LET IT HAPPEN?

30:40.472 --> 30:42.308
WELL, THERE WAS
NO STOPPING JENNIFER.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.509
THE KID WAS ON FIRE.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.277
GREAT, WON'T BE
ANY MIRANDA ISSUES AT TRIAL.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.179
BUT THERE ARE
SOME OTHER ISSUES.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.048
CUE THE VIOLINS.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.282
SHE NEEDS TO BE LOCKED UP,

30:50.316 --> 30:52.084
BUT SOMEPLACE
WHERE SHE CAN GET HELP.

30:52.118 --> 30:55.321
YOU WANT ME TO DUMP THE CASE
ON FAMILY COURT?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.889
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO DUMP ANYTHING.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.057
JENNIFER IS A KILLER.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.359
BUT SHE'S 14.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.895
SHE'S NOT A HARDENED CRIMINAL.
TRY HER AS A JUVENILE.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.932
I WOULD,
BUT IT'S NOT MY CALL.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.034
I GOT WARNER'S RESULTS
ON THE TIDE CHARTS.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.301
ELSA'S BODY WENT
INTO THE RIVER

31:09.335 --> 31:10.569
JUST OFF HOBOKEN.

31:10.602 --> 31:14.306
THE HORN BLEW
BECAUSE THE BOAT WAS DOCKING.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.009
THIS ISN'T A NEW YORK CASE.
IT'S NEW JERSEY.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.611
WHICH IS BAD NEWS
FOR JENNIFER.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.180
THEY TRY KIDS HER AGE
AS ADULTS

31:21.213 --> 31:23.315
AND SEND THEM
TO PRISON FOR LIFE.

31:27.519 --> 31:28.955
(Gill)
NO WAY, DETECTIVES.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.056
LOOK, SHE'S A TROUBLED GIRL,

31:30.089 --> 31:32.091
NOT A STONE-COLD KILLER.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.292
THE WORLD IS FULL
OF TROUBLED GIRLS.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.526
MOST DON'T COMMIT MURDER.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.694
AND THE WORLD RECOGNIZES
THE DIFFERENCE

31:35.727 --> 31:37.463
BETWEEN KIDS WHO KILL
AND ADULTS.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.231
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY OTHER COUNTRY
THAT GIVES A CHILD

31:39.265 --> 31:40.933
LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE
IS SOMALIA.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.634
NOW, DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO BELONG TO THAT CLUB?

31:42.668 --> 31:44.403
I DIDN'T WRITE THE LAW.
I JUST ENFORCE IT.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.472
RIGHT, YOU'VE PUT AWAY
THREE KIDS FOR LIFE

31:46.505 --> 31:48.574
IN THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS,
TWO BLACKS, ONE HISPANIC.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.209
NOW YOU PUT AWAY
A RICH WHITE GIRL,

31:50.242 --> 31:51.944
KINDA MAKES YOU COLOR-BLIND,
DOESN'T IT?

31:51.978 --> 31:54.947
YOUR RICH WHITE GIRL
HAS 160 IQ

31:54.981 --> 31:57.283
AND NO HISTORY OF ABUSE,
ADDICTION, OR MENTAL ILLNESS.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.550
DON'T TELL ME
SHE DIDN'T KNOW

31:58.584 --> 32:00.552
WHAT SHE DID WAS WRONG.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.488
SHE'S 14 YEARS OLD.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.522
ARE YOU THE SAME PERSON
THAT YOU WERE BACK THEN?

32:03.555 --> 32:05.624
AT 14, I WASN'T A MURDERER.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.493
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?
JUSTICE.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.229
FOR ELSA
AND FOR JENNIFER.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.597
SHE'S NOT SOME PSYCHOPATH

32:11.630 --> 32:13.565
THAT HAS TO BE LOCKED UP
BEFORE SHE KILLS AGAIN.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.733
SHE'S COLD AND CONNIVING.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.335
SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING,
AND SHE KNEW THE CONSEQUENCES.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.704
HEARING'S TOMORROW.

32:18.737 --> 32:21.373
I'M CALLING YOU BOTH
AS WITNESSES.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.146
(Gill)
WHEN YOU QUESTIONED
JENNIFER BANKS,

32:27.179 --> 32:29.381
DID SHE SHOW REMORSE
FOR MURDERING ELSA LYCHKOFF?

32:29.415 --> 32:32.284
NOT EXACTLY.

32:32.318 --> 32:35.988
DIDN'T SHE IN FACT SAY
"I'M GLAD SHE'S DEAD"?

32:36.022 --> 32:37.256
YES.

32:37.289 --> 32:41.327
WAS JENNIFER DEFENDING HERSELF
WHEN SHE ATTACKED THE VICTIM?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.495
SHE TOLD US
THAT ELSA PUSHED HER.

32:43.529 --> 32:47.166
ELSA PUSHED HER AWAY
AFTER JENNIFER GRABBED HER ARM.

32:47.199 --> 32:50.369
THEN WHAT
DID JENNIFER DO?

32:50.402 --> 32:53.305
SHE JABBED HER
IN THE CHEST WITH A PEN.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.641
JABBED OR STABBED?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.676
THE M.E. REPORT
DOCUMENTS STAB WOUNDS.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.145
THREE OF THEM.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.779
SHE GRABBED ELSA'S HAIR
AND SLAMMED HER HEAD

33:00.812 --> 33:02.514
AGAINST THE RAILING,
HOW MANY TIMES?

33:02.548 --> 33:04.150
FOUR.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.285
AND JENNIFER CONFESSED

33:06.318 --> 33:09.055
TO ALL THESE ACTS
OF VIOLENCE?

33:09.088 --> 33:12.058
YES.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.293
DID JENNIFER BOARD THE FERRY
PLANNING TO KILL ELSA?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.062
(Stabler)
NO, SHE WENT THERE TO TALK.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.396
SHE AND ELSA
WEREN'T GETTING ALONG.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.332
SHE WANTED TO...
CLEAR THE AIR.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.701
HER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS,

33:22.734 --> 33:25.571
HER I.Q.,

33:25.604 --> 33:30.109
HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS
AT CHESS.

33:30.142 --> 33:31.177
CLEARLY, JENNIFER'S
A BRILLIANT GIRL.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.212
(Benson)
WITH THE INTELLECT
OF AN ADULT,

33:33.245 --> 33:35.381
AND THE EMOTIONS OF A CHILD.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.549
SHE WAS FORCED
TO COMPETE,

33:37.583 --> 33:39.518
FORCED TO EXCEL
IN A GROWN-UP WORLD,

33:39.551 --> 33:43.155
AT SCHOOL, AT CHESS,
AT EVERYTHING.

33:43.189 --> 33:44.323
SHE CRACKED.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.757
CAN THAT CRACK
BE REPAIRED?

33:45.791 --> 33:47.359
ONLY IF SHE GETS HELP.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.231
DID JENNIFER BANKS KNOW
THAT HER ACTIONS WERE WRONG?

33:52.264 --> 33:54.466
I'M NOT A SHRINK.
YOUR PARTNER TESTIFIED

33:54.500 --> 33:56.135
THAT SHE IS
EXCEPTIONALLY BRIGHT.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.370
BRIGHT ENOUGH
TO SPIN A STORY

33:58.404 --> 34:00.772
TO BEST CREATE A FALSE SCENT,
BRIGHT ENOUGH

34:00.806 --> 34:03.509
TO MANIPULATE YOU
INTO DISCOVERING FAKE EVIDENCE

34:03.542 --> 34:05.444
TO COVER HER TRACKS, CORRECT?

34:08.614 --> 34:10.282
YES.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.751
(Gill)
SHE ALMOST GOT AWAY WITH IT,
DIDN'T SHE?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.820
NOTHING FURTHER.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.155
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.624
I'LL HEAR THIS CASE
IN ADULT COURT.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.127
DETECTIVE,
YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.362
GAME OVER.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.830
OVER?
(judge)
MS. BANKS!

34:24.863 --> 34:26.298
THE GAME IS NEVER OVER.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.733
THERE'S ALWAYS
A WAY OUT!

34:27.766 --> 34:29.501
REPLAY THE MOVES,
LOOK FOR THE CRACK.

34:29.535 --> 34:30.769
NO, DON'T QUIT!

34:30.802 --> 34:32.238
BE SMARTER, BE BETTER,
FIGHT HARDER!

34:32.271 --> 34:33.305
(Benson)
JENNIFER, CALM DOWN.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.373
THE BEST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!

34:34.406 --> 34:36.208
THERE'S ALWAYS
A WAY OUT!

34:36.242 --> 34:38.344
I SEE EVERYTHING!
I KNOW THE MOVES!

34:38.377 --> 34:41.813
I WIN!
YOU CAN'T STOP ME!

34:41.847 --> 34:43.282
[sobbing]
NO!

34:43.315 --> 34:44.550
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF ME!

34:44.583 --> 34:48.854
[screaming continues]

34:48.887 --> 34:51.190
DON'T TOUCH ME,
YOU STUPID IDIOT!

34:51.223 --> 34:53.292
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

34:53.325 --> 34:55.494
NO, YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND!
NO!

34:55.527 --> 34:58.364
NO, WAIT,
PLEASE DON'T GO!

34:58.397 --> 34:59.665
DON'T GO!
PLEASE WAIT!

34:59.698 --> 35:02.401
WHY AM I HERE?
WHY AM I HERE?

35:02.434 --> 35:04.303
WHY AM I--
WHY AM I HERE?

35:04.336 --> 35:06.438
JENNIFER.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.774
YOU KILLED ELSA.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.143
[sobbing]

35:11.177 --> 35:12.378
DID I?

35:15.347 --> 35:19.585
HELP ME MAKE SENSE.
IT'S ALL BLANK.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.787
AND I'M TRAPPED
IN THIS HORRIBLE END GAME

35:21.820 --> 35:23.855
OF A CHESS MATCH
THAT I DON'T REMEMBER

35:23.889 --> 35:25.224
SITTING DOWN
TO PLAY.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.525
JENNIFER,
YOU CONFESSED.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.793
I CAN REMEMBER THINGS,

35:27.826 --> 35:29.361
BUT THEN I CAN'T.

35:29.395 --> 35:32.431
WAS IT ME WHO DID THIS,
OR WAS I DREAMING?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.866
BUT I CAN'T BE DREAMING.
I DON'T SLEEP.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.502
I NEVER SLEEP.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.171
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU NEVER SLEEP?

35:39.205 --> 35:41.473
I GO AND GO FOR DAYS
UNTIL I CRASH.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.809
NOBODY CAN SURVIVE
WITHOUT SLEEP.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.545
I CAN.

35:46.578 --> 35:47.846
WITH MY SECRET WEAPON.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.615
ARE YOU TAKING SOMETHING?

35:52.518 --> 35:54.353
PROVIGIL.

35:54.386 --> 35:57.456
IT HELPS ME STUDY.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.491
ONE LITTLE PILL,

35:59.525 --> 36:01.460
AND EVERY SYNAPSE FIRING.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.462
WHERE DO YOU GET IT?

36:03.495 --> 36:06.298
I BUY IT FROM KIDS
WITH A.D.D.

36:06.332 --> 36:09.268
EVERYONE'S ON DRUGS
AT MOREWOOD.

36:09.301 --> 36:13.372
ADDERALL, CONCERTA, RITALIN,
ANYTHING TO HELP YOU FOCUS.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.240
DOES THE SCHOOL KNOW?

36:14.273 --> 36:17.276
THEY TELL YOU
HOW TO GAME YOUR DOCTOR

36:17.309 --> 36:19.711
INTO PRESCRIBING IT.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.749
JENNIFER...

36:23.782 --> 36:25.417
JENNIFER, HOW LONG
HAD YOU BEEN UP

36:25.451 --> 36:27.353
THE NIGHT
BEFORE YOU KILLED ELSA?

36:27.386 --> 36:29.388
SIX DAYS.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.458
I WAS CRAMMING FOR EXAMS.

36:32.491 --> 36:36.428
POP A PILL,
I COULD READ FOUR BOOKS A NIGHT.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.265
AND DID YOU TAKE IT
AFTER THE TESTS?

36:39.298 --> 36:41.967
I DIDN'T NEED TO.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.303
BUT THEN I HAD TO PREP
FOR THE CHESS TOURNAMENT,

36:44.336 --> 36:45.504
SO I BOUGHT SOME MORE.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.838
AND HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN UP NOW?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.974
THREE DAYS.

36:49.007 --> 36:52.411
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING
THIS TIME.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.846
MY MIND
IS LIKE A JIGSAW PUZZLE,

36:54.880 --> 36:56.548
AND ALL THE PIECES

36:56.582 --> 36:58.550
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.286
IT'S A BIG MESS,

37:00.319 --> 37:01.953
AND I CAN'T PUT IT
BACK TOGETHER.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.822
I NEED PROVIGIL.

37:03.855 --> 37:07.526
PLEASE, YOU HAVE
TO BRING ME SOME.

37:09.295 --> 37:12.998
TELL ME WHERE IT IS.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.433
I KEEP IT SAFE,
WHERE NO ONE WILL FIND IT.

37:14.466 --> 37:18.337
SO NO ONE
CAN STEAL MY SECRET.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.442
TAKE ONE,
AND I'M EINSTEIN,

37:23.475 --> 37:25.277
DESCARTES, AND SHAKESPEARE.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.745
I WROTE A PLAY
IN ONE NIGHT.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.317
MY BRAIN
WAS FINALLY WORKING.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.918
I COULD UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.723
I WROTE IT ALL DOWN.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.661
I REALIZED I COULD TALK
TO ELSA.

37:42.694 --> 37:45.697
MAKE HER LIKE ME AGAIN.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.472
THIS TYPE OF HYPERGRAPHIA
IS COMMON WITH PROVIGIL ABUSE.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.607
THE DRUG WAS DEVELOPED
TO TREAT NARCOLEPSY

37:55.641 --> 37:57.476
AND OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.411
THEN THE GOVERNMENT DISCOVERED
ITS MILITARY VALUE

37:59.445 --> 38:00.546
AS A STIMULANT,

38:00.579 --> 38:02.548
GAVE IT TO THE TROOPS
TO KEEP THEM ALERT IN THE FIELD.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.850
NOW KIDS ARE USING IT
TO CRAM FOR THEIR EXAMS.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.084
WHEN USED PROPERLY,

38:06.117 --> 38:07.453
IT IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT
FOR A.D.D.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.887
PROPERLY, YEAH, RIGHT.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.389
TELL ME THOSE KIDS
AT MOREWOOD POPPING PILLS

38:10.422 --> 38:12.491
ALL HAVE
ATTENTION DEFICIT.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.025
I'LL TIP OFF A FRIEND
IN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.528
SEE IF WE CAN STOP
THE PILL PUSHING.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.664
SO IF JENNIFER
WAS ABUSING PROVIGIL,

38:18.697 --> 38:20.466
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN UP
FOR SIX DAYS STRAIGHT.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.601
THE WORLD RECORD
IS 11 DAYS,

38:22.634 --> 38:24.470
UNTIL GUINNESS STOPPED
ACKNOWLEDGING THE CATEGORY

38:24.503 --> 38:25.737
BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH RISKS
INVOLVED.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.540
HOW SERIOUS?
POTENTIALLY DEADLY.

38:28.574 --> 38:31.977
THAT'S WHY SLEEP DEPRIVATION
IS USED AS A TORTURE TECHNIQUE.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.612
WELL, JENNIFER WAS
A MESS IN COURT

38:33.645 --> 38:34.813
AFTER ONLY THREE DAYS
WITHOUT SLEEP.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.014
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

38:36.047 --> 38:39.485
ONE STUDY SHOWED
THAT 17 HOURS WITHOUT SLEEP

38:39.518 --> 38:43.722
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF HAVING
A .05 BLOOD ALCOHOL CONTENT.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.023
THAT'S LEGALLY IMPAIRED.

38:45.056 --> 38:47.659
SO WHAT SYMPTOMS
WOULD SHE HAVE?

38:47.693 --> 38:48.827
ANYTHING RANGING
FROM IRRITABILITY

38:48.860 --> 38:50.862
TO DELUSIONS
TO PSYCHOSIS.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.664
JENNIFER WAS MANIC
IN INTERROGATION,

38:52.698 --> 38:54.366
AND OUT OF HER MIND
IN THE COURTROOM.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.369
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE
ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

38:57.403 --> 39:00.105
(Gill)
AN INSANITY PLEA?

39:00.138 --> 39:02.608
THAT'S THE LAST STOP
FOR EVERY HACK LAWYER

39:02.641 --> 39:04.943
TOO STUPID OR LAZY
TO PREPARE A CREDIBLE DEFENSE.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.079
BUT IF THE FACTS SUPPORT IT,
IT'S A WINNER.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.716
YOUR GIRL MISSED A NAP.
THAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY MURDER.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.852
SLEEP DEPRIVATION PSYCHOSIS
IS A CLINICAL CONDITION.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.921
JENNIFER BANKS WAS TEMPORARILY
OUT OF HER MIND

39:15.954 --> 39:17.956
WHEN SHE KILLED ELSA.

39:17.989 --> 39:18.990
I'M SURE DEFENSE COUNSEL
WILL TRY IT ON THE JURY.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.459
I DON'T THINK IT'LL FLY.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.627
YOU DIDN'T GET WHERE YOU ARE
WITHOUT PULLING

39:21.660 --> 39:22.561
A FEW ALL-NIGHTERS.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.162
YEAH, I'VE GONE
TWO DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.399
ONLY THING I MURDERED
AT THE END OF IT WAS MY PILLOW.

39:29.535 --> 39:32.771
I KNEW A COP WHO WORKED A DOUBLE
HOMICIDE FOR 41 HOURS STRAIGHT,

39:32.804 --> 39:35.040
THEN WENT HOME
AND WENT TO BED.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.175
HE HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.745
SO HE REACHED
FOR HIS INHALER.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.780
BUT HE GRABBED
HIS SERVICE REVOLVER INSTEAD.

39:41.813 --> 39:45.083
HE PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH,
AND HE BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.822
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

39:50.856 --> 39:54.926
I WANT YOU...

39:54.960 --> 39:57.963
TO READ JENNIFER'S JOURNAL.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.935
SLEEP ON IT.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.914
(Judge Stallworth)
ACCORDING TO THE TERMS
OF THE PLEA AGREEMENT,

40:15.947 --> 40:17.916
THE DEFENDANT IS REMANDED

40:17.949 --> 40:20.919
TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUVENILE JUSTICE

40:20.952 --> 40:25.156
FOR A PERIOD
NOT TO EXCEED SEVEN YEARS.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.225
CHANGE OF HEART, MS. GILL?

40:27.258 --> 40:30.929
NEWLY DISCOVERED
EVIDENCE SHOWS

40:30.962 --> 40:33.198
THE DEFENDANT'S MENTAL STATUS
AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER

40:33.231 --> 40:35.501
WARRANTS LENIENCY.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.670
YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY
YOUNG LADY.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.606
DON'T SQUANDER
YOUR GOOD FORTUNE.

40:40.639 --> 40:43.575
[gavel bangs]

40:50.616 --> 40:52.651
GOOD LUCK.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.719
[sniffles]

41:00.291 --> 41:02.594
YOU'LL BE OUT BY 21.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.896
THANK YOU.

41:10.769 --> 41:14.806
(Benson)
WELL, AT LEAST
SHE STILL HAS A CHANCE.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.108
MY NEXT CASE.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.610
15.

41:18.644 --> 41:19.978
RAPED AND MURDERED

41:20.011 --> 41:22.147
HIS SIX-YEAR-OLD STEPSISTER.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.182
NO REMORSE.
SAYS HE'D DO IT AGAIN.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.618
YOU WANT HIM OUT
AT 21 TOO?

41:29.821 --> 41:32.824
