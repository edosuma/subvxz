WEBVTT

00:05.464 --> 00:07.091
I just ate a bag
of cheese boodles

00:07.299 --> 00:08.892
without using my hands.

00:09.092 --> 00:12.687
Lazy Tuesday, you are
delivering in a big way.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.641
Yeah, it's nice
to finally have a day

00:15.849 --> 00:19.695
where nothing interesting
happens whatsoever.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.820
[screaming]

00:24.024 --> 00:25.196
Everyone get down!

00:25.359 --> 00:27.407
Don't let it taste
human flesh.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.073
- What is it?
- Can we keep it?

00:31.240 --> 00:33.163
Kill it, kill it!

00:38.830 --> 00:40.173
Patience.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.376
[growling, screeching]

00:42.584 --> 00:43.836
Gotcha!

00:48.590 --> 00:50.058
Great. Now get it
outta here.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.432
Smells like if death
could barf.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.104
Grunkle Ford,
need any help with that?

00:54.304 --> 00:56.682
I've read all about
these creatures in your journal,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.688
- and I think I--
- No!

00:58.892 --> 01:00.565
I'm sorry, Dipper.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.271
On the dark, weird road
I travel,

01:02.479 --> 01:04.697
I'm afraid you
cannot follow.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.489
Well, call me for dinner.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.786
Maybe next time then?
Or not.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.584
Or never.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.913
Oh, Dipper, don't
take it so hard.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.376
No, do take it hard.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.707
Take it hard
and serious.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.134
My brother is
a dangerous know-it-all

01:24.334 --> 01:25.961
and the stuff he's messing
with is even worse.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.718
Do yourself a favor and stay
away from him, you hear me?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.723
But Grunkle Stan,
all summer long,

01:30.882 --> 01:32.680
I've wanted to know who
the author of the journal was.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.311
Now the guy lives
in our basement,

01:34.511 --> 01:35.979
and I can't even
talk to him.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.102
Don't worry about
what's on the basement.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.560
- You belong up here with me and Mabel.
- Yeah!

01:40.767 --> 01:44.692
Besides, the season finale
of Duck-tective is Friday.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.149
That's all the mystery
you need this week.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.530
Come on, quack
with us, Dipper.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.577
Quack, quack, quack.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.529
Yeah. Quack, quack, quack.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.786
[both quacking]

01:57.951 --> 01:59.999
[quacking continues]

02:00.162 --> 02:02.381
Quack, quack, quack!

02:02.581 --> 02:04.458
Why isn't he quacking?

02:04.666 --> 02:06.464
<i>IA'</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:46.876
Dear Mom and Dad,

02:47.042 --> 02:48.385
we've been in Gravity Falls
for a few months,

02:48.585 --> 02:49.757
and so much has happened.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.342
Just yesterday,
gravity reversed itself,

02:51.546 --> 02:53.594
almost destroyed
the universe,

02:53.799 --> 02:56.473
and totally wrecking
the whole town.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.179
<i>They say it was
an earthquake,</i>

02:58.387 --> 02:59.855
<i>but you know what I think?</i>

03:00.055 --> 03:01.648
<i>I think I'm gonna
have to start serving</i>

03:01.848 --> 03:03.270
<i>pineapple
right-side up cake.</i>

03:03.475 --> 03:06.103
<i>[laughs]
Am I right?</i>

03:06.311 --> 03:07.654
<i>Am I right?</i>

03:07.854 --> 03:10.607
<i>Let the rebuilding
of the town begin.</i>

03:10.816 --> 03:12.614
<i>Wrecking ball,
start wrecking things.</i>

03:12.818 --> 03:14.912
<i>[laughs]</i>

03:15.112 --> 03:16.705
The coolest part
of the summer

03:16.905 --> 03:18.703
was Grunkle Stan's
twin brother

03:18.907 --> 03:20.750
came out of
this portal thingy

03:20.951 --> 03:22.828
Now we have two grunkles
for the price of one.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.664
And they are adorable
together. '-

03:25.872 --> 03:27.294
"We love each other
so much!"

03:27.499 --> 03:29.092
[kissing sounds]

03:29.292 --> 03:30.919
Mabel, you'll never guess
what I found

03:31.128 --> 03:32.050
at the store today.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.927
Dogs. Dogs with hats!

03:34.131 --> 03:37.556
No. It's my favorite
fantasy-talking, level-counting,

03:37.759 --> 03:40.478
statistics and graph-paper
involving game of all time:

03:40.679 --> 03:43.148
Dungeons, Dungeons,
and More Dungeons!

03:43.348 --> 03:44.691
You wanna play it
with me?

03:44.891 --> 03:47.235
Well, I do like uniforms,

03:47.436 --> 03:49.063
and that hot elf
looks promising.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.365
- How do you play?
- The rules are simple.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.696
First, you roll
a 38-sided die

03:53.900 --> 03:55.277
to determine the level
of each player's

03:55.485 --> 03:56.953
statistical analysis
power orb.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.282
These orbs relate directly
to the amount of power quadrants

03:59.489 --> 04:01.162
that your tem
has dominion over,

04:01.324 --> 04:02.746
which is inverse to
the anti-quadrants

04:02.951 --> 04:04.168
in your quadrant satchel.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.837
And then
we ride unicorns?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.630
_ Yes!
_ [gasps]

04:07.831 --> 04:08.707
And no.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.920
First, we make a graph.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.972
[groans]
This is like Homework the Game.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.721
Come on, Mabel. I need at least
two people to play.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.144
Oh, wow,
would you look at that?

04:21.344 --> 04:24.223
Two people.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.401
Hey, Soos, up for a little game of
D & D & More D?

04:27.559 --> 04:28.981
Sorry, Dipper, I don't
go in for

04:29.186 --> 04:30.984
that pen-and-paper
kinda stuff.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.735
- I'm more of an FCLORP-er.
- A what?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.407
FCLORP.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.576
Foam & Cardboard Legitimate
Outdoor Role Playing.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.825
It is where a passionate
brethren of craftsmen

04:39.029 --> 04:41.157
bring their dreams
to magical reality.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.576
Let yon priestess go,
Elf Mage.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.707
Never, Paladin
Radmaster.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.505
Fireball, fireball,
fireball.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.962
I'm a fortress.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.218
Well, thanks
anyways, Soos.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.217
Say, is this that game
that's mostly math and writing

04:56.421 --> 04:58.389
and isn't anything like
the picture on the box?

04:58.590 --> 05:01.218
Yes, it is! You wanna
play with me, Grunkle Stan?

05:01.426 --> 05:05.306
Ha! Look, kid, I prefer
to do my dice rolling in Vegas.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.312
Besides, only a game
designed by nerds

05:07.516 --> 05:10.019
would have "Charisma"
as a fantasy power.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.774
Check this out.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.480
"When facing
yon adversaries,

05:13.688 --> 05:16.441
shield thyself under
an elfan buttress."

05:16.650 --> 05:18.618
Ha ha, say it again.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.617
- Buttress.
- [both laughing]

05:20.821 --> 05:22.573
Hey, laugh all you want.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.875
You guys just aren't
smart enough to understand it.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.079
Sorry, dude, but it is
kinda nerdy.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.584
Well, I'm off to lay siege
to a goblin fortress.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.257
To my grandma's backyard!

05:32.457 --> 05:33.925
[sighs]

05:35.418 --> 05:37.591
Oh, nice, you rolled a 17.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.720
- [bleats]
- And this is sad.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.976
Maybe I should start obsessing
over Wendy again.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.520
- [crunching]
- Hey, give it back.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.307
Come on, Gompers.
Let go.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.688
Oh, man, my 38-sided die!

06:09.035 --> 06:10.662
Dipper, StOP!

06:10.871 --> 06:12.088
Great-uncle Ford.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.587
What did I say
about coming down here?

06:14.791 --> 06:17.886
My work is far too dangerous
for a single living soul

06:18.086 --> 06:20.305
to spend even one second--

06:20.505 --> 06:22.473
Wait. Is that
a 38-sided die

06:22.674 --> 06:24.972
from Dungeons, Dungeons,
And More Dungeons?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.554
Yeah. You know that game?

06:27.721 --> 06:30.725
With pen and paper,
shield and sword...

06:30.932 --> 06:34.061
[both] ...our quest shall be
our sweet reward!

06:34.269 --> 06:35.691
[laughing]

06:35.896 --> 06:39.526
This is my favorite game
in the whole multi-verse.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.110
I can't believe
they still make it.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.195
They do, and I've been
looking all day

06:43.361 --> 06:44.578
for someone
to play with me.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.999
My boy, do you know
what this means?

06:48.199 --> 06:51.578
We must stop everything
I've been working on at once,

06:51.786 --> 06:53.459
<i>and DEV'-!</i>

06:58.293 --> 07:00.512
That's going
to leave a mark.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.556
Okay, I think we've got
everything we need to watch

07:03.840 --> 07:05.934
the season finale of
Duck-tective tomorrow.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.681
I even made mouth ramps

07:07.844 --> 07:09.642
so we can pour food
into our mouths

07:09.804 --> 07:11.727
without taking our eyes
off the screen.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.934
[chewing loudly]

07:14.142 --> 07:15.815
And I recreated
the main character

07:16.019 --> 07:17.646
out of spare
taxidermy parts.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.527
Quack, quack,
I'm the duck detective.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.358
Who stole my bread loaf?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.988
[both laughing]

07:23.193 --> 07:24.410
That is so messed up.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.988
Dipper would love that.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.743
Yeah, where is
the little squirt anyway?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.700
I haven't seen him
all afternoon.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.745
All right, you
enter the chamber.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.207
Princess Unattainabelle
beckons you.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.382
- But wait, it's a trap.
-[gasps]

07:38.583 --> 07:42.679
An illusion cast by
Probabilitor the Annoying.

07:42.879 --> 07:43.926
You know his weakness, right?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.928
[both] Prime statistical
anomalies over 37

07:46.132 --> 07:48.726
but not exceeding 51.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.975
Yes! In your face,

07:51.179 --> 07:53.602
you cardboard wizard.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.525
Hmm, the old boy looks
a bit different

07:55.725 --> 07:57.193
than he did back in my day.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.271
Yeah, they change the art
every few yea rs.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.072
Thankfully, you missed
the period

08:01.272 --> 08:03.741
when the creators of the game
tried to make it "cooler."

08:04.818 --> 08:06.445
Man, this game
is boring.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.749
You dare challenge
Probabilitizzle?

08:10.949 --> 08:13.077
<i>♪ Put the cat back
and roll the dice a'</i>

08:13.243 --> 08:16.213

08:16.413 --> 08:18.336

<i>- Available wherever dope games are sold.

08:21.042 --> 08:24.046
[shudders] Must've been
dark times, those '90s.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.849
Sounds like a good time
to be stuck between dimensions.

08:28.049 --> 08:31.144
Great-uncle Ford,
I've been meaning to ask you.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.472
Where were you before
you came out of that machine,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.023
and what have you
been doing down here?

08:35.222 --> 08:36.816
Are you working on something
behind that curtain?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.019
Dipper, it's best if
you and the family

08:39.227 --> 08:41.650
stay away from
that subject.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.358
Honestly, I'm not sure any of you
could handle the real answer.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.276
- But I could handle it.
- Ah!

08:46.443 --> 08:48.161
But I can show you
a little something

08:48.319 --> 08:49.616
I brought back with me.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.913
An infinity-sided die.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.041
[Dipper gasps]

08:57.203 --> 09:00.127
That's so cool...
and impossible.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.925
These things are outlawed
in 9,000 dimensions.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.096
Wanna know why?
Look at those symbols.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.140
Infinite sides means
infinite outcomes.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.718
If I rolled it,
anything could happen.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.637
Our faces could
melt into jelly.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.225
The world could
turn into an egg.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.558
Or you could just
roll an eight. Who knows?

09:17.766 --> 09:21.361
That's why I have to keep it in
this protective cheap plastic case.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.237
Now, back to the game.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.281
You've got Probabilitor
on the ropes.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.241
[Dipper] Oh, man.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.533
Then if I drag it here,
and then a plus-three--

09:34.741 --> 09:36.618
Dipper, are you gonna
90 to sleep?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.703
You've been saying
dork words for hours.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.631
Sorry, Mabel.
I gotta finish this dungeon.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.549
It's gonna totally stump
Great-uncle Ford tomorrow.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.627
I can't wait to see
the look on his face.

09:45.835 --> 09:49.715
You're, uh, spending a lot of time
with old Fordsie lately, huh?

09:49.881 --> 09:51.428
You have no idea.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.101
I knew the author
must be cool,

09:53.301 --> 09:54.598
but he's better
than I imagined.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.604
And he doesn't make fun
of me all the time,

09:56.763 --> 09:58.390
the way you
and Grunkle Stan do.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.566
Give him time.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.819
Hi-oh!

10:03.019 --> 10:04.817
Ah, you got me.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.733
You got me.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.574
Thanks for coming over
to watch tonight's

10:12.779 --> 10:14.622
Duck-tective
finale, Grenda.

10:14.823 --> 10:18.293
Of course. I'm so invested
in the life of these characters.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.336
Hey, hey,
look at you.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.164
Someone's
all dressed up.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.589
It's a big night.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.713
I think we all remember
where we were

10:25.917 --> 10:27.635
when we learned
Duck-tective was shot.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.304
[clock strikes]

10:29.504 --> 10:31.723
Viewing positions,
everyone!

10:34.050 --> 10:37.304
Ahh! Graph paper.
Kill it, kill it!

10:37.512 --> 10:40.186
Dipper, could you maybe
move this to another room?

10:40.390 --> 10:41.562
No dice.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.188
We ran out of room
in the basement

10:43.393 --> 10:44.519
and we're going for
a world record.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.320
Now dice!

10:46.479 --> 10:47.822
<i>Thirty-two.</i>

10:48.022 --> 10:51.322
- Yes! 7,000 points damage.
- You got me.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.282
Why with this?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.204
Wanna break
a record, Ford?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.582
You already got it for
world's nerdiest old man.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.285
Hey, at least I'm not all keyed
up to watch a kids' show.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.370
I'll have you know
that Duck-tective

11:02.579 --> 11:05.002
has a big mystery element,
and a lot of humor

11:05.206 --> 11:06.628
that goes over kids' heads.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.255
I don't get
a lot of it,

11:08.459 --> 11:10.211
but I like animals
in human situation.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.343
Grunkle Stan,
it starts in a few minutes.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.973
Move that
and pay the price.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.646
Oh, what, 50 magical
dwarf dollars?

11:19.804 --> 11:22.102
Don't mock our fantastical
monetary system.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.025
I'll mock all I want.
It's my TV room.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.568
It's my house!
You...

11:25.768 --> 11:28.692
Listen, Stanley,
did it ever occur to you

11:28.897 --> 11:31.616
that if you joined us,
you might actually have fun?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.193
What? Now you listen to me.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.453
As long as I live,
I will never--

11:35.653 --> 11:36.905
- Grunkle Stan, wait.
- Ever.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.161
- Stanley!
- Play your smarty-pants nerd game.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.833
[[511

11:48.041 --> 11:52.012
Mortals of Dimension 46
Apostrophe Backflash.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.759
Kneel before me and...

11:55.798 --> 11:58.426
Snivel.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.512
I am Probabilitor,

12:00.720 --> 12:03.394
the greatest wizard
in all mathology,

12:03.598 --> 12:05.692
give or take
an error of 0.4.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.314
Is this normal?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.987
Have you come to send us
on the quest of a lifetime,

12:10.188 --> 12:11.565
because we're the smartest
players you've ever met?

12:11.773 --> 12:14.868
You are the smartest
players I've ever met.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.695
That's why I'm going
to eat your brains,

12:16.903 --> 12:18.155
to gain your intelligence.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.447
It's what I do.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.000
- It's his thing.
- What?!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.294
Seize them!

12:24.494 --> 12:27.088
Your math is no match
for my gun, you idiot.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.585
Math ray!

12:30.959 --> 12:32.961
I'm not here to play games.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.175
Now to the forest
for the ultimate game.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.607
So the room's
free now.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.517
- Who wants to watch <i>Duck-tective?</i>
- [squeaks]

12:48.977 --> 12:51.947
Nobody?
More couch for Grenda.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.733
Oh, no. That crazy wizard
is gonna eat

12:55.942 --> 12:58.991
our brother's brain.
We have to stop him.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.573
Maybe let him get a couple
of bites in Ford's brain first.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.658
Even things out,
smartness-wise.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.460
- Grunkle Stan!
- All right, all right.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.958
I guess if we have
no other choice,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.998
we'll go on a...
[sighs]

13:10.206 --> 13:11.753
Epic wizard quest.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.711
- [cheering]
- Everyone grab a weapon.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.932
Nice.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.225
We're coming
for you, Dipper.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.601
And Great-uncle Ford.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.060
And possibly
that hot elf,

13:27.265 --> 13:28.938
if he's got anything
to do with this.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.776
[laughing]

13:35.982 --> 13:37.609
With each brain
I eat,

13:37.817 --> 13:40.536
I shall increase
my enchant-elligence.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.989
If my hands were free,

13:42.196 --> 13:44.198
I'd break every part
of your face.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.750
The time has come.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.578
Hot elf, ready
the brain-cooking pot.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.164
Uh, yes, Probabilitor.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.685
We must be getting close.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.471
These fairy bites
are getting more frequent.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.773
Hey, look, listen.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.152
Halt! You interlopers
are trespassing

14:13.353 --> 14:15.697
on the ancient forest
of Probabilitor the wizard.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.319
If ye wish to pass,

14:17.482 --> 14:20.736
first ye must complete
seven unworldly quests,

14:20.943 --> 14:23.822
each more difficult
than the last.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.621
Is he... dead?

14:27.825 --> 14:30.203
He's magic, sweetie.
I'm sure he's fine.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.038
There's no cops
in the forest.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.708
We take this
to our graves.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.668
[laughing]

14:36.876 --> 14:38.628
- What do we do, what do we do?
- Stop thinking, Dipper.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.634
The more wrinkled
your brain gets,

14:40.838 --> 14:42.135
the more he'll
wanna eat it.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.718
And now, a little
math problem.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.728
When I subtract
your brain from your skull,

14:47.929 --> 14:51.604
add salt and divide your family,
what's the remainder?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.526
[Mabel] Your butt!

14:53.726 --> 14:56.730
What? My butt isn't part of
this particular equation.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.440
[all roaring]

14:58.648 --> 15:01.026
Drat! How did you make it
past my one guard?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.577
Very well.

15:02.777 --> 15:06.577
There's only one way
your family can save you.

15:06.781 --> 15:09.204
You must defeat me

15:09.409 --> 15:12.037
in Dungeons, Dungeons,
And More Dungeons,

15:12.203 --> 15:14.456
real life edition!

15:15.540 --> 15:17.634
[maniacal laughter]

15:17.834 --> 15:19.757
What? Oh, come on.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.638
I choose my characters
versus...

15:22.839 --> 15:24.386
[gasping]

15:24.590 --> 15:26.308
Yours.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.352
Oh, my ears.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.100
They're so pointy.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.726
There better be
something protective

15:31.931 --> 15:34.354
under this tunic.
Oh, no, there isn't.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.357
Seriously?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.362
Can't we just, like,
arm wrestle or something?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.489
Come on, this game
is a lot of fun.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.613
I had my mom
pack me a lunch.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.320
Ew, apple slices?
I'll eat you last.

15:45.528 --> 15:49.032
Just make with
the rules, ugly.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.117
The game is
a battle royale.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.581
We help our characters
by casting spells

15:52.785 --> 15:54.537
determined by
rolls of the dice.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.749
If you win, I go
back to my own dimension.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.382
But if I win,
I eat their brains.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.712
Hey, I'm not sure
this is such a good--

16:02.879 --> 16:04.631
- Deal!
- Oh, boy.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.718
Let the game begin!

16:10.970 --> 16:11.971
Attack!

16:16.726 --> 16:18.478
What do we do?
What are our moves?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.646
There are no moves.
You make them up.

16:20.855 --> 16:21.981
What? Really?

16:22.190 --> 16:24.033
Yes. I tried to tell you.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.612
This game involves math,
but also risk and imagination.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.914
- Risk!
- Imagination?!

16:30.114 --> 16:32.993
Grunkle Stan, make something up.
It's just like lying.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.870
I cast... uh...

16:36.078 --> 16:36.874
[groans]

16:37.079 --> 16:39.332
Shield of shielding.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.590
Ha! We're doin' it.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.798
Shield of shielding
reversal spell.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.012
I cast giggle time
bouncy boots.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.608
Hot flame-y sword.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.152
Super-hot flame-y sword!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.108
[[511

17:06.317 --> 17:08.661
Drat you.
You'll never outrun my...

17:08.861 --> 17:13.583
Ogre-nado. It is what
it sounds like.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.252
<i>1 cast Centaur-tam'. Yah!</i>

17:25.920 --> 17:29.220
Mabel, I am so confused
and so proud right now.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.646
[cheering]

17:51.696 --> 17:53.118
Ha ha ha, yes!

17:53.281 --> 17:55.750
I was saving
the worst for last.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.247
Oh, no.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.668
The impossi-beast.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.712
Hey, I thought
they banned this character.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.961
Think again. I'm playing
the controversial

18:03.165 --> 18:05.884
1991-1992 edition.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.596
I'll think of some weapons.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.343
You don't understand.

18:10.548 --> 18:11.765
This is the most powerful
monster in the game.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.719
He can only be defeated
by rolling a perfect 38.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.849
But the odds of that are--

18:16.053 --> 18:18.727
Hey, long odds
are what you want

18:18.931 --> 18:20.478
when you're
a world-class gambler.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.814
All right, Stan,
you can do this.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.771
Papa needs
a new pair of...

18:24.979 --> 18:26.572
twins!

18:34.530 --> 18:35.998
No!!

18:36.198 --> 18:37.825
Sorry, nerd wizard.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.584
All of your smarts
are no match for dumb luck.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.505
I cast Death Muffins!

18:50.755 --> 18:52.257
[both] Yes!

18:53.799 --> 18:55.051
Ha ha ha!

18:55.259 --> 18:57.057
The game is, like, over.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.854
Excelsi-whatever.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.854
No! I'm returning to
my own realm.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.652
I'm turning into
pure math.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.402
What are the odds?!

19:10.691 --> 19:12.318
Grunkle Stan,
that was amazing.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.903
How did you know
that you would win?

19:14.111 --> 19:16.409
Hey, a gambler never reveals
his secrets.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.703
Man, that was fun
for ages eight to 80.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.539
Or a million or however
old you guys are.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.047
You know, I'm sorry for
making fun of your game, kiddo.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.093
Sure, it might be
too nerdy for me,

19:30.294 --> 19:31.921
but it's just the right
amount of nerdy

19:32.129 --> 19:33.676
for you and my brother.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.466
And if you two
wanna hang out sometimes,

19:35.675 --> 19:36.722
I won't get in your way.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.261
Actually, after all that,

19:38.469 --> 19:40.221
I could use
a little mindless fun.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.649
Guys, we can watch the second
showing of Duck-tective.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.396
- It's not too late.
- [squeaks]

19:52.608 --> 19:54.906
<i>I just don't understand
who shot you.</i>

19:55.111 --> 19:57.455
<i>The only person clever enough
to defeat Duck-tective</i>

19:57.655 --> 19:59.783
<i>is... [gasps]
Duck-tective.</i>

20:09.458 --> 20:11.711
He had a twin brother
all along?

20:11.919 --> 20:14.092
That's the big twist
we were waiting for?

20:14.296 --> 20:15.297
What a rip-off.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.053
I predicted that,
like, a year ago.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.060
This will be here
if you ever need it.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.644
Really? Even though I got us into
the whole game-playing mess?

20:27.852 --> 20:29.729
Ah, we both got
carried away.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.532
I guess we'd both gone for
a while without a friend.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.031
Dipper, can I
tell you something?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.445
You asked me earlier

20:38.654 --> 20:40.156
what I was working on.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.699
Well...

20:41.907 --> 20:44.080
I dismantled
the portal.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.416
An inter-dimensional
gateway is too dangerous

20:46.620 --> 20:47.917
for the world
it feeds into.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.754
That's why I was
mad at Stan for using it.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.631
He saved me,
but as I feared,

20:52.835 --> 20:55.884
the instability
of the machine created this.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.715
An inter-dimensional rift.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.429
I've contained it for now,

20:59.633 --> 21:01.351
but it's
incredibly dangerous.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.429
Dipper, I don't want you
to tell anyone about this.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.310
Not Stan, not even
your sister.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.518
- Do you understand?
- Oh, of course.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.730
In my time, I've made
many powerful enemies.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.406
But I trust you
with this secret.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.575
Now get yourself
to bed.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.949
I have much research
to do.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.746
Good night,
Great-uncle Ford.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.323
Good night, Dipper.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.922
Guys, do you ever think
maybe we're doin' this

21:38.130 --> 21:40.007
'cause our lives
aren't special enough?

21:40.216 --> 21:42.344
That we use fantasy as
an escape to avoid

21:42.551 --> 21:43.643
the self-improvement
we all need?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.020
That maybe we should
just go out

21:45.221 --> 21:46.564
and grow with people?

21:46.722 --> 21:49.566
Fortresses can't
speak.
