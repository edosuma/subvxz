(serene music playing)

01:04.500 --> 01:06.734
Rose, can you help me
with this necklace?

01:06.800 --> 01:07.867
Oh, sure.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.600
Oh, I'm so nervous.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.533
Have you ever given a eulogy?

01:11.600 --> 01:12.967
You mean at a funeral?

01:15.600 --> 01:17.867
No, at a pie-eating contest.

01:19.633 --> 01:22.100
I just don't know
what I'm going to say.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.066
Actually, I was asked
to say a few words

01:24.133 --> 01:27.066
at Lenny Linderflot's funeral once.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.633
Everybody thought
we were good friends

01:28.700 --> 01:31.066
because all through school
he sat in front of me

01:31.133 --> 01:33.066
because we were
in alphabetical order.

01:33.133 --> 01:35.333
But all I knew about Lenny

01:35.400 --> 01:38.567
was what the back
of his head looked like.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.166
So, what did you say?

01:40.233 --> 01:43.333
"I loved the back
of Lenny Linderflot's head.

01:44.633 --> 01:47.333
He had the back of the head
of an honest man.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.867
And after seeing him
face up in the casket,

01:49.934 --> 01:52.567
not a bad-looking guy either."

01:53.834 --> 01:54.500
Thanks, Rose.

01:54.567 --> 01:58.367
It's not exactly what I'd like
to say about my brother Phil.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.000
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help.

02:00.066 --> 02:01.667
You've been more than a help.

02:01.734 --> 02:05.200
I wouldn't have gotten through
these past few days without you.

02:05.266 --> 02:08.266
Stop. So, what are you going to say?

02:08.333 --> 02:11.133
I just want
to say a few words

02:11.200 --> 02:14.767
to give the man some dignity
and show him a little respect.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.166
Ready?

02:22.867 --> 02:25.467
To run with the bulls in Pamplona?

02:27.567 --> 02:30.467
Dorothy, you know this is
my funeral dress.

02:30.533 --> 02:34.600
I don't believe in wearing black,
unless I'm a little bloated.

02:36.033 --> 02:38.633
Did you happen to notice
if my mother is all right?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.333
She's fine right now.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.800
You know, last night she talked to
me about the pain of losing a child.

02:45.867 --> 02:49.900
That's got to be the most painful
thing a mother can go through.

02:49.967 --> 02:51.433
She's being a rock.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.333
Maybe too much of a rock.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.567
She's keeping this all bottled up.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.834
She's in shock.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.700
The whole family's in shock.

02:58.767 --> 03:02.166
I mean, a man goes out
to buy himself an evening gown,

03:02.233 --> 03:04.834
you don't expect anything usual,
do you?

03:06.934 --> 03:07.900
-No.
-No.

03:09.467 --> 03:12.467
Heart attack, at his age.

03:12.533 --> 03:15.066
I spoke to him a couple
of weeks ago. He was fine.

03:15.133 --> 03:16.700
He said he'd put on some weight.

03:16.767 --> 03:21.934
But to die trying on knock-offs
at big gal's payless...

03:24.266 --> 03:26.266
it's just all so sad.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.767
Well, I'm all set.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.333
What's with Satan's secretary?

03:33.433 --> 03:35.867
Sophia, I believe Phil
would have liked this dress.

03:35.934 --> 03:38.133
He would've looked great in it.

03:39.667 --> 03:42.100
I never understood why your brother
liked to wear women's clothes,

03:42.166 --> 03:43.433
unless he was queer.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.834
Sophia, people don't say
queer anymore, they say gay.

03:46.900 --> 03:50.433
They say gay if a guy can sing
the entire score of <i>Gigi,</i>

03:50.500 --> 03:53.233
but a 6' 3", 200-pound
married man with kids

03:53.300 --> 03:56.266
who dresses like Dorothy Lamour,
you've got to go with queer.

03:59.033 --> 04:00.834
Ma, I don't know.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.333
He must have had some deep
psychological need,

04:04.400 --> 04:07.500
and cross-dressing
provided an emotional outlet.

04:07.567 --> 04:11.233
I may be old-fashioned,
but why didn't he just drink?

04:13.967 --> 04:16.266
Tell me,
is big Sally coming to the funeral?

04:16.333 --> 04:19.867
Phil's wife's name is Angela.
Why do you call her big Sally?

04:19.934 --> 04:22.033
Because she hates it.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.467
Just like she hates

04:23.533 --> 04:26.000
that I talked Phil into being
buried in the family plot.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.300
He never should have married her.
She hates all of us.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.633
Not true. She hates you.

04:32.300 --> 04:35.500
Don't you think this feud
between you and Angela

04:35.567 --> 04:37.000
has gone on long enough?

04:37.066 --> 04:38.567
It's 26 years.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.367
In Sicily, that's not a feud.

04:40.433 --> 04:42.900
In Sicily, people scream
at each other for centuries,

04:42.967 --> 04:45.867
and they throw pasta at each other,
pasta and sauce,

04:45.934 --> 04:50.834
rich sauce with delicious seafood.
Mussels, shrimp...

04:50.900 --> 04:54.767
Wait a minute, I think
I switched from feud to food.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.400
(soft music playing)

05:03.467 --> 05:06.633
He looks very peaceful and natural.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.233
As natural as a man can look
wearing a black teddy.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.333
It's a beautiful teddy.

05:21.667 --> 05:25.033
I think more men should
be buried in teddies.

05:27.066 --> 05:30.233
I've just got to remember it's not
the clothes that make the man.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.934
It's the man that makes the clothes.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.433
Oh, God, he looks like he died
in a benny hill sketch.

05:38.266 --> 05:40.100
I guess there's nothing
we can do about it now.

05:40.166 --> 05:43.300
Besides,
it's probably what Phil wanted.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.600
I going to check on ma.

05:44.667 --> 05:48.367
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't see anything wrong with it.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.033
Thank you, Blanche.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.133
This means a lot coming from a woman

05:52.200 --> 05:55.500
who wants to be buried
dressed like a majorette.

06:00.433 --> 06:03.767
Ma, you want to come
say goodbye to Phil?

06:03.834 --> 06:06.233
I can't go up there.
Is that terrible?

06:06.300 --> 06:09.533
No. You're doing what you can.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.166
Does he look nice?

06:11.233 --> 06:14.066
-Yeah.
-In a suit?

06:14.133 --> 06:16.700
Not exactly.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.166
A dress?

06:18.233 --> 06:20.400
Not exactly.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.834
Culottes?

06:23.967 --> 06:27.667
Not in culottes, that would
break my heart.

06:27.734 --> 06:30.467
No. He's wearing a teddy.

06:30.533 --> 06:32.567
But a masculine teddy.

06:33.934 --> 06:35.133
Where is big Sally?

06:35.200 --> 06:38.266
Ah, Ma. Her name is Angela.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.867
Ma, I want you
to make peace with her.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.834
Hello, Dorothy. Sophia.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.533
-Angela.
-Dorothy.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.300
I don't know
if it was such a good idea

06:50.367 --> 06:53.100
to have the funeral
in Miami instead of Newark.

06:53.166 --> 06:56.633
I just talked to the priest.
He doesn't know a thing about Phil.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.000
He thinks Phil was some
crazy combination

07:00.066 --> 07:01.900
brain surgeon/astronaut.

07:01.967 --> 07:05.367
Where would he get the idea
Phil had an I.Q. of 160?

07:10.433 --> 07:13.867
Well, if your brother hadn't been
stumped by long division...

07:17.367 --> 07:20.000
Angela, about this teddy--

07:20.066 --> 07:22.734
It's a beaut, isn't it?

07:22.800 --> 07:24.800
No surprise though.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.266
Phil had great taste.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.433
That's one of the things
I loved about him the most

07:29.500 --> 07:32.734
from the beginning,
his sense of style.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.800
You know, we were
married for 26 years.

07:36.867 --> 07:40.533
And my family still talks
about that wedding dress.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.800
God, I wish I could wear
a plunging neckline like that.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.900
Why couldn't you
bury him in a suit?

07:48.967 --> 07:51.900
Because this is what he wanted.

07:51.967 --> 07:54.266
You know, it hasn't
been easy for me, Sophia.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.000
It hasn't been easy.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.467
Ladies, I'd like to get started
with the service soon.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.867
Father Salerno,
Angela was worried

08:04.934 --> 08:08.066
that my mother might have
given you the wrong idea

08:08.133 --> 08:10.700
about what kind of man
my brother Phil was.

08:10.767 --> 08:11.567
Not to worry.

08:11.633 --> 08:14.967
The lord has given me a sixth sense.

08:15.033 --> 08:18.367
I can tell a lot about a person
just by looking at them.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.100
-He was special.
-I'm sure.

08:48.667 --> 08:53.533
What can I say
about Philip Petrillo?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.900
He was... special.

08:59.533 --> 09:02.066
Very special.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.533
Yeah, a man doesn't get
any more special than this.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.967
Wait a minute.

09:09.033 --> 09:12.033
Is this one of those
hidden video things, huh?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.900
No? Sorry.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, I think special says it.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.667
He knows Phil like a book.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.600
No charge.

09:44.967 --> 09:47.166
Are you all right, Sophia?

09:47.233 --> 09:49.233
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

09:49.300 --> 09:51.734
I'm ok. I'm fine.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.333
I don't want to talk about it.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.467
I saw a lot of this
when I worked at the grief center.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.700
You're angry about Phil's death,
and that's normal.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.867
But you shouldn't be
angry with Angela.

10:02.934 --> 10:08.033
I think you haven't cried because
you haven't accepted his death yet.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.033
Thank you.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.967
I've never been psychoanalyzed
by a dipstick before.

10:17.233 --> 10:19.166
I wonder who they are.

10:19.233 --> 10:20.333
You mean you don't know them?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.100
No.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.867
Now, this is awful.

10:23.934 --> 10:25.233
What's awful?

10:25.300 --> 10:26.233
Isn't it obvious?

10:26.300 --> 10:29.500
Veiled, shapely creatures,
unknown to the family,

10:29.567 --> 10:33.700
coming to say one last secret
goodbye to their special friend.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.300
-You mean--
-That's right, sluts.

10:40.100 --> 10:43.967
I can't believe they came
all the way from Newark.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.533
You know them?

10:45.600 --> 10:46.767
Phil tried to keep them a secret,

10:46.834 --> 10:50.166
but I knew he was spending
Thursday nights with them.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.934
I know it's hard,
but try not to hate them.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.867
They're just lonely creatures

10:55.934 --> 10:59.133
who were reaching out to another
person for a little warmth.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.166
These are the guys
from Phil's poker game.

11:05.767 --> 11:08.333
This is too funny. I have to get
my camera from the car.

11:15.734 --> 11:20.166
I wish you wouldn't rush back
to Newark after the funeral.

11:20.233 --> 11:22.333
Stay at the house
for a few days.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.066
I gotta get back to work.

11:24.133 --> 11:26.800
I was just promoted.
Chief makeover artist

11:26.867 --> 11:28.633
in the cosmetic department
at Bamburgers'.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.767
Angela. Angela, this has to end.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.100
You know, I don't think
the family even knows

11:33.166 --> 11:34.500
what the fight was about.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.266
I'll tell you what it was about.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.333
Your mother hates me.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.500
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.967
I've been invited to your
mother's house twice

11:43.033 --> 11:45.266
in the past 26 years.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.834
And that was quite enough.

11:46.900 --> 11:49.667
Then why don't you come
to my house?

11:49.734 --> 11:51.233
Angela, please?

11:51.734 --> 11:53.066
Okay.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.467
I'll come.

11:55.533 --> 11:58.834
Maybe I could show Blanche
how to correctly apply her makeup.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.633
I'd like that.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.467
Although she might be offended
if I bring it up.

12:05.533 --> 12:07.266
That's the part I like.

12:09.433 --> 12:10.700
Angela.

12:10.767 --> 12:11.667
Oh.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.934
Folks, to begin
this part of the service,

12:18.033 --> 12:20.900
Phil's sister Dorothy
will say a few words.

12:20.967 --> 12:21.867
Dorothy.

12:23.767 --> 12:27.867
Please don't take this wrong,
but I've got to know.

12:27.934 --> 12:29.834
You are a girl, aren't you?

12:37.834 --> 12:39.033
(sighs)

12:40.400 --> 12:43.400
It seems like I'm always
mad at my brother Phil.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.967
I was mad the day

12:46.033 --> 12:49.400
my parents brought him
back from the hospital.

12:49.467 --> 12:54.100
I thought he'd take
their love away from me.

12:54.166 --> 12:59.500
Instead, their love expanded,
and we felt more like a family.

13:01.233 --> 13:04.400
I was mad at him when
I was 10 and he was four,

13:04.467 --> 13:06.333
and we moved to
a new neighborhood.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.834
I was mad because
he always made new friends

13:09.900 --> 13:12.066
more easily than I did.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.533
And I'm mad today

13:15.600 --> 13:18.734
because I never wanted
to give the eulogy

13:18.800 --> 13:20.767
at my kid brother's funeral.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.533
I'm mad because he died.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.367
He didn't have the wisdom to know

13:28.433 --> 13:33.800
that family members shouldn't
allow themselves to grow apart,

13:33.867 --> 13:35.967
because when this day comes,

13:36.033 --> 13:40.066
they can no longer tell
each other how they care.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.367
If he'd had that wisdom,
he could have shared it with me,

13:44.433 --> 13:47.100
and I would have known
the hundreds of memories

13:47.166 --> 13:50.000
I have of just the two of us,

13:50.066 --> 13:54.300
eating ice cream
on the stoop of our building

13:54.367 --> 13:57.100
or going through the drawers
at grandma's house

13:57.166 --> 14:00.000
or dressing up
like the Bronte sisters.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.033
How those memories
fill me with joy.

14:06.533 --> 14:09.166
Why didn't you have that wisdom,
Phil?

14:09.233 --> 14:14.934
Why didn't you... give us a chance
to tell you how much we loved you?

14:16.500 --> 14:20.367
(sad music playing)

14:26.600 --> 14:30.500
(mellow music playing)

14:32.467 --> 14:34.333
Here we go, some nice snacks.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.834
Oh, thank you, Rose.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.734
Oh, look, here's one of Phil
when he was 17.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.200
Oh, he looks so handsome.

14:43.266 --> 14:46.333
Oh, I don't think
I ever saw him in a tuxedo.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.033
When was this? His prom?

14:48.100 --> 14:49.433
Halloween.

14:51.633 --> 14:52.900
Listen, Angela,

14:52.967 --> 14:55.834
what do you say you and
ma and I have dinner tonight

14:55.900 --> 14:58.433
and clear the air a little bit?

14:58.934 --> 15:00.467
Angela, please.

15:00.533 --> 15:05.333
Hey, I'm willing.
But I don't know what I did.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.333
I also don't know
how much more I can take

15:07.400 --> 15:09.600
of Sophia treating me this way.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.033
Hi, everybody. I'm back.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.800
Hi, Ma. Did you
have a nice walk?

15:13.867 --> 15:15.000
Yeah.

15:15.066 --> 15:16.834
Where did you get the skateboard?

15:16.900 --> 15:19.600
Oh, yeah.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.300
I guess there's some kid
at the park with an umbrella.

15:27.533 --> 15:30.433
Ma, how would you like
to go out to dinner

15:30.500 --> 15:32.600
-with Angela and me?
-Nope.

15:32.667 --> 15:36.200
This isn't an easy time
for any of us.

15:36.266 --> 15:37.100
Forget it, Dorothy.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.633
I don't need her
to be there for me.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.300
The shame is
she wasn't there for Phil.

15:42.367 --> 15:45.800
When you wouldn't see me,
you weren't seeing him.

15:46.700 --> 15:47.734
On the holidays,

15:47.800 --> 15:50.667
when he would try to pretend
that everything was okay,

15:50.734 --> 15:53.066
deep down, it killed him
that he wasn't with his family.

15:53.133 --> 15:55.767
My children never got to know
their grandmother

15:55.834 --> 16:00.066
because you didn't want
to step foot inside my house.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.166
Well, it wasn't just their loss,
Sophia. It was yours too.

16:03.233 --> 16:08.133
So whatever I did
or whatever you think I did,

16:08.200 --> 16:10.734
I hope it was worth all the pain.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.867
You showed disrespect
for our family.

16:12.934 --> 16:14.834
Family's sacred
where I come from.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.533
Phil knew how I felt.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.967
You think it was easy?
I did what I had to.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.500
What did I do?

16:21.567 --> 16:24.100
You know very well what you did.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.600
I swear I don't.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.266
Your dowry check bounced.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.266
What dowry check?

16:37.333 --> 16:39.266
Your father gave us
a check for 2 million

16:39.333 --> 16:41.500
when we agreed
to let you marry Phil.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.433
$2 million for Phil?

16:44.500 --> 16:47.233
Wasn't exactly
a buyer's market, was it?

16:49.200 --> 16:52.266
Not $2 million, it was lira.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.767
With the exchange rate,
it came to about $47,

16:54.834 --> 16:57.200
but the check bounced anyway.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.867
That is terrible!

16:58.934 --> 17:01.800
I know. I told Sal, get cash.

17:04.200 --> 17:08.100
It's terrible that's
what the fight was about.

17:08.166 --> 17:11.567
My father offered a dowry,
and Charlie wouldn't take it.

17:11.633 --> 17:13.066
Maybe that's because he knew

17:13.133 --> 17:15.200
eventually those beans
would stop jumping.

17:20.100 --> 17:23.133
Or maybe he just loved me.

17:23.200 --> 17:27.433
Beans... I'll have you know, it was
the biggest pumpkin of the season.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.934
I don't know who I'm madder at,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.066
my father for thinking
he had to pay a dowry

17:35.133 --> 17:38.934
or you for letting
this go on for $47.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.600
Nobody stiffs the Petrillos.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.467
Fine.
You think your family was wronged.

17:43.533 --> 17:44.667
Let me make it right.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.800
Here. Here's a check. We're even.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.300
Now are you happy?

17:49.367 --> 17:53.033
Can I see your driver's license
and a major credit card, please?

17:59.266 --> 18:01.066
It was an out-of-state check.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.567
-Angela, I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.834
I'm getting the next flight home.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.967
Please, hang up the phone.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.266
I don't want you
to go like this.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.266
There's nothing
left to say.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.333
My mother wants to apologize.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.066
Why didn't she come in?

18:22.133 --> 18:23.433
She's shy.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.300
Sophia is shy?

18:27.367 --> 18:30.166
In an obnoxious sort of way.

18:30.233 --> 18:33.400
I have to get you
and ma to end this.

18:33.467 --> 18:36.133
Not for you, not for me. For Phil.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.867
I was wrong not doing it
while he was still alive.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.734
Now, come on.
Take the first step.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.400
What is it going to take?

18:45.467 --> 18:47.266
She has to admit
she's a little witch

18:47.333 --> 18:49.667
when it comes
to family matters,

18:49.734 --> 18:52.467
who takes pleasure in making
other people miserable.

18:52.533 --> 18:54.567
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

18:57.233 --> 18:59.467
Ma, she really likes you.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.400
I think this whole thing
can be fixed.

19:03.467 --> 19:04.800
Forget it.

19:04.867 --> 19:07.934
When I think of Phil,
you know what I think of?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.600
His capacity to love.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.233
You know, no matter what
anyone did to Phil,

19:13.300 --> 19:15.900
he always gave back love.

19:15.967 --> 19:18.100
And you know where
he learned that, Ma?

19:18.166 --> 19:19.300
From you.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.967
Now, Ma, what's happening to you?

19:22.033 --> 19:24.967
Please, won't you come
into the kitchen?

19:25.033 --> 19:28.000
When she comes to me on her knees
begging forgiveness.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.734
I think she'd like that.

19:33.567 --> 19:35.266
All right.

19:35.333 --> 19:38.700
The little witch is ready
to apologize for everything.

19:38.767 --> 19:39.567
She said that?

19:39.633 --> 19:42.700
In her own old-world way,
yes. Come on.

19:46.633 --> 19:48.166
What are you doing?

19:48.233 --> 19:51.066
I thought we'd walk out
on our knees.

19:51.133 --> 19:52.400
Why?

19:52.467 --> 19:53.667
Ice breaker?

19:54.734 --> 19:57.133
She didn't apologize,
did she?

19:57.200 --> 20:00.633
I've had it, I've had it.
That's enough! Come on.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.934
Now, isn't somebody
going to say something?

20:09.000 --> 20:09.734
Ma?

20:11.133 --> 20:11.867
Angela?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.033
Fine. I'll wait.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.667
You know what I think?

20:22.734 --> 20:25.166
That reindeer really
know how to fly?

20:27.900 --> 20:28.967
That's enough, Blanche.

20:29.033 --> 20:31.100
I spent a lot of time
at that grief center.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.300
I know what
I'm talking about.

20:33.367 --> 20:39.133
Sophia, is that $47
the only thing that's bothering you?

20:40.333 --> 20:42.867
It's a big part of it.

20:42.934 --> 20:43.834
What else?

20:43.900 --> 20:45.934
The dress thing.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.233
Why didn't she stop
the dress thing?

20:48.300 --> 20:50.500
He's been doing that all his life.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.233
That didn't start with me.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.633
Oh, so it's my fault?

20:54.700 --> 20:57.600
Are you worried people
will think it's your fault?

20:58.567 --> 21:01.333
It's not like having
a war hero in the family.

21:03.166 --> 21:05.467
-Was he a good husband?
-Yeah.

21:05.533 --> 21:08.033
A good provider, a good father
for your children?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.166
Yeah!

21:09.233 --> 21:10.633
Ok.

21:10.700 --> 21:13.100
Now, I know no one
wants to hear

21:13.166 --> 21:15.600
one of my stories right now...

21:15.667 --> 21:19.266
That's usually
a pretty safe bet, Rose.

21:19.333 --> 21:22.734
But you need to know
about my cousin Ingmar.

21:23.233 --> 21:25.166
Ingmar was different.

21:25.233 --> 21:27.133
He used to do bird imitations.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.800
What's wrong with that?

21:28.867 --> 21:32.033
You didn't want to park your car
under their oak tree.

21:39.700 --> 21:40.700
No...

21:42.233 --> 21:44.033
Ingmar was different.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.734
His mother used to say
he brought shame

21:46.800 --> 21:50.066
to the house of
Hossenfeffershtuleduker.

21:52.567 --> 21:56.934
Anyway, you're all wondering
where this story's going,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
so I'll skip the part
where he ran up the stairs

22:00.066 --> 22:05.300
and down the stairs and up
the stairs and down the stairs

22:05.367 --> 22:08.533
-and up the stairs--
-Rose, you're not skipping!

22:08.600 --> 22:09.667
Sorry.

22:09.734 --> 22:12.433
The point is it was shame

22:12.500 --> 22:16.600
that kept aunt Katrina
from loving slow Ingmar,

22:16.667 --> 22:18.533
and it ruined her life.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.000
Oh, don't let that happen to you,
Sophia.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.200
Let go of the shame.

22:23.266 --> 22:25.467
So, what if he was different?

22:25.533 --> 22:28.266
It's ok that you loved him.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.066
I did love him.

22:34.133 --> 22:36.200
He was my son.

22:36.266 --> 22:38.934
My little boy.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.767
But every time I saw him,
I always wondered

22:41.834 --> 22:44.867
what I did, what I said,

22:44.934 --> 22:48.166
when was the day
that I did whatever I did

22:48.233 --> 22:50.233
to make him the way he was?

22:59.934 --> 23:04.166
What he was, Sophia,
was a good man.

23:06.066 --> 23:08.700
My baby is gone.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.300
Oh, Sophia.

23:18.633 --> 23:22.767
(theme music playing)
