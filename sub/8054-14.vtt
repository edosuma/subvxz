WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:02.851
And it's because of you, our teachers, 

00:02.851 --> 00:05.840
that everyone of this recreation, classes in this catalog,

00:05.841 --> 00:07.471
Shines like a jewel

00:07.471 --> 00:09.406
In pawnee's beautiful crown.

00:09.473 --> 00:11.374
[light applause]

00:11.442 --> 00:13.976
Unfortunately,
due to budget constraints,

00:14.044 --> 00:15.411
This year
we will have to remove

00:15.478 --> 00:17.100
Five jewels from that crown.

00:17.168 --> 00:18.709
- Excuse me?

00:18.777 --> 00:19.894
Are you cutting our classes?

00:19.961 --> 00:21.068
- Yeah.

00:21.136 --> 00:24.627
The city, um, took away $1,000
from our budget.

00:24.695 --> 00:25.830
So I'm very sorry.

00:25.898 --> 00:28.638
- How will you decide
which classeto cut?

00:28.706 --> 00:31.511
- By attendance.
And student evaluations.

00:31.579 --> 00:34.016
So just make sure your students
leave with a smile.

00:34.084 --> 00:37.455
- My class is called
"coping with terminal illness."

00:37.523 --> 00:40.326
- Hopefully,
your attendance is good.

00:40.394 --> 00:41.827
Actually, no.

00:41.895 --> 00:43.664
Hopefully, it's bad.

00:43.731 --> 00:45.566
Nobody's more upset about this
than me.

00:45.634 --> 00:47.368
I've been taking
these rec center classes

00:47.436 --> 00:48.970
Since I was in high school.

00:49.038 --> 00:50.406
It's where I learned
hair braiding

00:50.473 --> 00:53.911
And how to make biscuits,
french kissing.

00:53.979 --> 00:55.981
The french kissing was just
from a boy in my biscuits class,

00:56.048 --> 00:58.351
But either way,
lesson learned.

00:58.418 --> 01:01.322

01:21.432 --> 01:22.758
- I wanna go.

01:22.825 --> 01:24.026
- We have to get tickets
in February

01:24.094 --> 01:25.594
To go to rio de janeiro,
leslie knope.

01:25.662 --> 01:27.029
- Okay.

01:27.097 --> 01:30.233
I am on a date with justin
in indianapolis.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.434
We've only been out
a few times,

01:31.502 --> 01:32.869
But every one of them
has been amazing.

01:32.937 --> 01:34.170
- Cheers.

01:34.238 --> 01:37.475
- Last time, we had
a private tour and cocktails

01:37.543 --> 01:39.112
At the indianapolis aquarium.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.649
That fish over there
kind of reminds me of my mom.

01:41.717 --> 01:43.051
- Why?

01:43.118 --> 01:44.984
- It's...
Just being really withholding.

01:45.051 --> 01:46.618
Justin is definitely
the most interesting guy

01:46.686 --> 01:47.786
I've ever dated.

01:47.853 --> 01:50.088
- All I did
was a little paperwork.

01:50.156 --> 01:51.456
- Hmm. He's being modest.

01:51.524 --> 01:54.493
It is thanks to him my family
remains in this country.

01:54.561 --> 01:56.096
And it was all pro bono.

01:56.163 --> 01:57.163
- Oh, justin.

01:57.231 --> 02:01.067
- You have got to try this.

02:01.135 --> 02:02.235
- Oh, that's really good.

02:02.303 --> 02:03.603
- Isn't it great?
- Mm-hmm.

02:03.671 --> 02:06.273
- It's camel stomach.
- Is it?

02:06.340 --> 02:07.574
- I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
It's chicken.

02:07.642 --> 02:09.508
[chuckling]

02:09.577 --> 02:10.977
- Would you like to try
the camel stomach?

02:11.044 --> 02:12.279
- No.

02:12.347 --> 02:14.115
[laughing]

02:14.183 --> 02:15.751
- Oh, this is me.

02:15.819 --> 02:17.420
- So when am I gonna
see you again?

02:17.487 --> 02:19.422
Oh, you know what?

02:19.490 --> 02:20.824
I'm gonna be near pawnee
on Tuesday.

02:20.892 --> 02:22.125
- Excellent, yeah.

02:22.193 --> 02:23.293
I'll plan something
exciting.

02:23.361 --> 02:25.529
- Mm.
- In fact...

02:25.597 --> 02:26.731
Our date in pawnee

02:26.798 --> 02:28.433
Is gonna blow indianapolis
out of the water.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.804
- All right.
I'm gonna hold you to that.

02:31.871 --> 02:32.972
- Good, you better.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.510
- I will.

02:36.577 --> 02:38.212
- I've racked my brain

02:38.280 --> 02:40.313
And I can't come up with
one exciting idea.

02:40.381 --> 02:42.580
I mean, he once ate
fried cockatoo

02:42.648 --> 02:44.715
With a member of
the thai royal family.

02:44.783 --> 02:46.849
- Well,
maybe just have him over

02:46.917 --> 02:48.183
And cook him some chicken

02:48.251 --> 02:50.282
And tell him
it's pawnee cockatoo.

02:50.350 --> 02:53.216
- A dinner party.
That's genius.

02:53.284 --> 02:55.852
I'll invite all my most
interesting friends over,

02:55.920 --> 02:57.220
We'll have this big
rambling party--

02:57.288 --> 02:59.389
- No, I actually meant more of,
like, a one-on-one thing.

02:59.457 --> 03:00.557
- I know what you meant,

03:00.624 --> 03:01.925
But I took your idea
and made it better.

03:01.992 --> 03:03.192
It's called a think tank,
ann.

03:03.260 --> 03:04.294
- What is?
- Our lunches.

03:04.361 --> 03:05.728
Our lunches are like
think thanks.

03:05.796 --> 03:07.564
Okay, I want you to come over
to my house at 2:00

03:07.631 --> 03:08.731
And help me get ready.

03:08.799 --> 03:10.032
Oh, and make sure
that mark is coming.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.901
Oh, so much work to do.
You're my best friend.

03:11.969 --> 03:15.237
Now get out of here!

03:15.305 --> 03:17.472
- How many courses
will there be?

03:17.540 --> 03:19.541
- Three.
- Mm.

03:19.609 --> 03:21.509
- Four.
- Mm...

03:21.577 --> 03:23.711
- Not including dessert.
- So five courses.

03:23.779 --> 03:26.347
- Yes. Now it will be
five courses.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.782
- If I wanted to bring

03:27.849 --> 03:30.684
A large number
of deviled eggs

03:30.752 --> 03:33.654
But I didn't want to share them
with anyone else,

03:33.722 --> 03:35.222
Can you guarantee
fridge space?

03:35.290 --> 03:37.157
- Just be there at 8:00.

03:37.225 --> 03:39.893
Oh, hey, tom.

03:39.961 --> 03:41.228
I'm having an a-list
dinner party for justin

03:41.295 --> 03:42.562
And you,
out of all my friends,

03:42.630 --> 03:44.164
Come from the most distant
and exotic land.

03:44.231 --> 03:45.565
- South carolina?

03:45.633 --> 03:47.967
- [laughs]
save it for the party.

03:48.035 --> 03:49.202
Can you make it?

03:49.270 --> 03:51.671
- For justin,
are you kidding? I'm there.

03:51.739 --> 03:53.372
Just don't invite
any boring people like jerry.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.540
- What are you guys
talking about?

03:54.608 --> 03:55.608
- Nothing.
- Don't worry about it.

03:55.676 --> 03:56.876
- What?

03:56.943 --> 03:59.545
- [humming]
[approaching footsteps]

03:59.612 --> 04:01.280
- Leslie, hey.
- Hi.

04:01.347 --> 04:02.915
- Check it out.
Just practicing.

04:02.983 --> 04:04.250
- Isn't that polish
gonna get on people's butts

04:04.317 --> 04:05.418
When they sit down?

04:05.485 --> 04:07.419
- [scoffs]
no.

04:07.487 --> 04:08.754
- Okay, listen.
I'm having a party.

04:08.821 --> 04:10.155
- Mm-hmm.

04:10.223 --> 04:11.656
- And, um, I thought maybe
you could help me with serving

04:11.724 --> 04:12.824
And taking people's coats.

04:12.892 --> 04:13.958
I'd pay you, like,
ten bucks an hour.

04:14.026 --> 04:16.892
- My guardian angel,
I would love to.

04:16.961 --> 04:18.760
Who's gonna be there?
- Really fun people.

04:18.827 --> 04:21.262
Ron, tom, mark and ann.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.797
- [clears throat]

04:22.864 --> 04:24.231
That's great.
What's the occasion?

04:24.299 --> 04:25.432
- Justin's coming to town.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.534
- Hah...

04:27.602 --> 04:28.935
Hey, it's me justin.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.936
Take my coat,
but please be careful.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.471
I got it from
the king of africa

04:32.538 --> 04:36.307
When we were walking on the--
the berlin wall together.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.608
Really, justin.

04:37.676 --> 04:40.344
What instruments
do you play?

04:40.412 --> 04:41.779
Actually--

04:41.846 --> 04:44.047
Actually,
he's a pretty sick keyboardist.

04:44.115 --> 04:46.116
Oh, great, I'm good to go.
That sounds great.

04:46.183 --> 04:47.317
- Great.
- I'll see you there.

04:47.384 --> 04:49.151
- All right.

04:49.219 --> 04:50.319
- Afternoon, andy.

04:50.387 --> 04:51.787
- [laughs nervously]
hi, hi, kyle.

04:51.854 --> 04:53.088
You know, right before
you sat down,

04:53.155 --> 04:55.423
I noticed, did you have
some kind of stain on your ass

04:55.491 --> 04:56.857
Or something,
what was that?

04:56.925 --> 04:59.326
- What?

04:59.394 --> 05:01.726
- Oh, no, no, no.
You're good.

05:01.794 --> 05:04.128
[doorbell rings]

05:04.196 --> 05:05.395
- Hey, ann.
- Hey.

05:05.463 --> 05:06.862
- Welcome to my house
for the very first time.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.796
- I know, I can't believe
you've never had me over.

05:08.864 --> 05:11.165
- [laughs]

05:16.404 --> 05:18.305
- Now I can believe it.

05:18.373 --> 05:20.742
- I know, I know.
It's a little messy.

05:20.809 --> 05:21.911
But I have a system.

05:21.978 --> 05:23.512
So I just need you
to help me

05:23.580 --> 05:24.913
Put the finishing touches
on everything.

05:24.980 --> 05:28.681
- This newspaper's from
November 1986.

05:28.749 --> 05:31.217
- Oh, the first rumblings
of iran contra.

05:31.284 --> 05:32.484
Don't throw that out.

05:32.552 --> 05:34.686
- I think I need to call
child services

05:34.753 --> 05:37.121
And have leslie taken away
from herself.

05:37.188 --> 05:39.255
[groans]

05:39.323 --> 05:41.858
Leslie, don't take this
the wrong way,

05:41.925 --> 05:46.296
But your house is like
a crazy person's garage.

05:46.363 --> 05:48.498
What do you need
this birdhouse for?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.332
- Ah--

05:50.400 --> 05:51.500
- Can we get rid of it?

05:51.567 --> 05:53.268
- Ah--oh--
I might need it.

05:53.335 --> 05:55.136
- What about this one?

05:55.203 --> 05:57.471
- Well, if two birds
come along.

05:57.538 --> 05:58.638
- Leslie.

05:58.706 --> 05:59.672
- Andy's gonna come over soon.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.140
He can help us
with all this stuff.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.642
- Andy?
No. No, no, no.

06:03.710 --> 06:06.211
You need a team of professionals
to help.

06:10.515 --> 06:13.083
- I have an idea.

06:13.150 --> 06:15.784
Hi, is this maria portlesman

06:15.852 --> 06:18.886
From <i>organize your life</i>
<i>with maria portlesman?</i>

06:18.954 --> 06:20.354
- April, come here!

06:20.422 --> 06:21.688
- What?
- Shake my hand.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.023
- Why?

06:23.090 --> 06:24.457
- I can't tell if
I've exfoliated too much.

06:24.525 --> 06:25.591
I don't wanna creep justin out.

06:25.659 --> 06:26.892
I want him to respect
my handshake.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.494
- Why do you care about him?

06:28.561 --> 06:30.195
- Justin is hip.

06:30.263 --> 06:32.663
Pawnee is the opposite
of hip.

06:32.731 --> 06:34.198
People in this town
are just now

06:34.266 --> 06:35.732
Getting into nirvana.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.234
I don't have the heart
to tell them

06:37.301 --> 06:40.004
What's going to happen
to kurt cobain in 1994.

06:40.071 --> 06:42.273
Hey, justin.

06:42.341 --> 06:43.574
- Ew.

06:43.642 --> 06:45.342
It's like touching
raw chicken.

06:45.410 --> 06:47.075
- Damn it.

06:47.143 --> 06:48.912
Gonna have to re-foliate 'em.

06:48.980 --> 06:52.917
- Um, I'll need some help
moving the boxes,

06:52.984 --> 06:54.451
But it's doable.

06:54.519 --> 06:56.353
- Oh, thank god.
How much do I owe you?

06:56.421 --> 06:58.488
- Oh, please.
No charge.

06:58.556 --> 07:01.157
I just appreciate
the chance to demonstrate

07:01.225 --> 07:02.992
How valuable my class is
to the rec center.

07:03.060 --> 07:06.428
And I hope you'll
keep that in mind.

07:06.496 --> 07:09.330
- Oh, no, no.
I insist on paying.

07:09.398 --> 07:12.533
- Oh, no, no.
I insist on demonstrating.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.435
- This is not going to affect
my decision at all.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.003
- Oh, of course not.

07:16.070 --> 07:18.338
- Stop winking.

07:18.406 --> 07:20.173
- Hey, leslie,
I forgot to ask you.

07:20.241 --> 07:22.008
What are you cooking?
- Five courses.

07:22.076 --> 07:24.444
- Of what?
- Huh?

07:24.511 --> 07:27.346
- Of what?
- Oh, god.

07:27.414 --> 07:30.782
[chopping vegetables]

07:30.850 --> 07:32.617
So how's it looking?
It smells great.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.685
- Okay, the appetizers
are almost ready.

07:34.752 --> 07:37.086
And I think that they are
a very good sampling

07:37.154 --> 07:39.121
Of what
my level one class does.

07:39.189 --> 07:40.222
Which I hope
you'll keep in mind

07:40.290 --> 07:41.723
When you're making
your decisions.

07:41.791 --> 07:44.126
- Tania, like I said
over the phone--

07:44.193 --> 07:45.227
- I know.

07:45.294 --> 07:46.528
It won't influence
your decision.

07:46.595 --> 07:47.696
It's just that learning
to cook

07:47.763 --> 07:48.830
Is very important
in this day and age.

07:48.898 --> 07:49.831
- Is it?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.373
- Hey, andy.
- Hey.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.175
- Are you gonna be all right
tonight?

07:56.242 --> 07:58.410
- What?
'cause of mark and justin?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.279
They are just guests at
a really awesome dinner party

08:01.347 --> 08:02.647
And I will treat them
as such.

08:02.715 --> 08:03.847
- That sounds
very professional.

08:03.915 --> 08:05.115
- Thank you.

08:05.183 --> 08:06.949
I promise I will not
spit in anyone's food,

08:07.017 --> 08:08.383
Unless they should request
that I do.

08:08.451 --> 08:10.318
- Good.
- Did I do this right?

08:10.386 --> 08:12.487
- I don't know.

08:12.555 --> 08:13.955
[doorbell rings]

08:14.023 --> 08:15.423
Oh, hey, mark.

08:15.490 --> 08:16.690
Welcome to my humble abode.

08:16.758 --> 08:18.992
- Well, thank you.
Wha--oh.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.161
This is way cleaner
than the last time I was here.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.633
- You've been here?

08:23.701 --> 08:25.401
Right.

08:25.469 --> 08:27.170
- When was mark here before?

08:29.739 --> 08:32.107
- Oh. Sex.

08:32.174 --> 08:35.644
- I can't wait
to talk to justin again.

08:35.712 --> 08:36.945
Last time he told me about

08:37.013 --> 08:40.448
How he snorkeled
with whale sharks in madagascar.

08:40.517 --> 08:41.616
That was after I told him

08:41.683 --> 08:45.320
That I sometimes go swimming
at the "y."

08:45.388 --> 08:47.289
- Oh, thank you, son.

08:47.356 --> 08:48.690
Leslie knope.

08:48.758 --> 08:51.826
I believe you've arranged
accommodations for these.

08:51.893 --> 08:53.160
- Yes, I have.

08:53.227 --> 08:54.627
- Uh, hey, ron swanson,
you didn't happen to hear about

08:54.695 --> 08:56.694
The incident with mayor
gunderson's dog, did you?

08:56.762 --> 08:58.162
- Oh, my god,
it was a blood bath.

08:58.229 --> 08:59.395
- No, no, no.
No talking.

08:59.462 --> 09:01.830
Everybody stop talking...
Until justin gets here.

09:01.898 --> 09:04.532
Don't use up your stories.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.867
- Well, I think somebody
from animal services

09:05.935 --> 09:07.035
Is gonna get canned.

09:07.103 --> 09:08.503
- Oh, my god,
what part of not talking

09:08.571 --> 09:10.905
Do you not understand?

09:10.973 --> 09:13.475
Please have a good time
and shut your mouth.

09:13.542 --> 09:14.943
I just want this dinner party
to go well.

09:15.010 --> 09:17.411
There are very few things
I've asked for in this world:

09:17.479 --> 09:19.446
To build a new park
from scratch,

09:19.513 --> 09:20.880
To eventually
become president,

09:20.948 --> 09:23.082
And to one day
solve a murder on a train.

09:23.149 --> 09:26.150
I think it's fair
to add this to the list.

09:26.218 --> 09:27.417
[overlapping conversations]

09:27.485 --> 09:28.752
[doorbell rings]

09:28.820 --> 09:30.587
- Guys, justin's here.
That's justin.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.689
Everybody.
Start talking.

09:32.757 --> 09:34.324
[silence]

09:34.391 --> 09:36.792
Wow...

09:36.860 --> 09:40.395
Oh...

09:40.463 --> 09:41.996
Hey.
- Hey.

09:42.064 --> 09:43.398
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm a little bit late.

09:43.465 --> 09:44.465
- Oh, that's okay.

09:44.533 --> 09:46.533
Welcome to
my very interesting party.

09:46.601 --> 09:47.701
- Andy dwyer.

09:47.769 --> 09:49.802
Can't wait to catch up
with this guy.

09:49.870 --> 09:52.037
- All right, justin,
may I take your coat, sir?

09:52.105 --> 09:55.006
- Why, yeah. Thank you.

09:55.074 --> 09:56.408
Can't wait.

09:56.476 --> 09:58.343
I finally get to hang out
with all your friends tonight.

09:58.411 --> 09:59.377
- I know, it's gonna be
super fun.

09:59.445 --> 10:00.545
It's gonna be a blast.

10:00.612 --> 10:01.979
Really, really, really,
just, like, the best

10:02.047 --> 10:03.114
And most exciting night
of your life.

10:03.181 --> 10:06.050
I cannot overhype it enough.

10:06.118 --> 10:07.885
- All right,
let's get started.

10:07.953 --> 10:09.920
- What's up, j?
- How are you doing, man?

10:09.988 --> 10:12.056
How are you? Justin.
- I have the swine flu.

10:12.123 --> 10:15.030
- Oh, I'm sorry--
- no, she doesn't.

10:15.097 --> 10:16.597
- [knocking on door]
yo.

10:16.665 --> 10:17.732
- Yo.

10:17.799 --> 10:19.534
- Is that justin's coat?

10:19.602 --> 10:21.669
- Oh, yeah.
Isn't it awesome?

10:21.737 --> 10:23.104
He got it in cambodia

10:23.172 --> 10:25.806
When he was hiking
mount everest.

10:25.874 --> 10:26.974
- Let's put chewed up gum
in his pockets.

10:27.042 --> 10:28.309
- That's genius.
But I can't.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.011
Leslie's being super cool
to me.

10:30.078 --> 10:32.345
I can't screw over
her boyfriend's jacket.

10:32.413 --> 10:34.247
- I'll do it when
you're not in the room then.

10:34.315 --> 10:39.151
- That would be terrible.

10:39.219 --> 10:41.720
I'm being sarcastic.
That would be awesome.

10:41.788 --> 10:44.389
- God, india is so amazing.
Let me tell you something.

10:44.457 --> 10:46.392
That is my absolute
favorite place to travel.

10:46.460 --> 10:47.726
Where did you say
your parents were from?

10:47.794 --> 10:50.295
- Um, the south part.

10:50.363 --> 10:53.164
- Oh, the southern part's always
the best part of anything.

10:53.232 --> 10:54.898
- Have you ever been
to the kanmian mosque,

10:54.966 --> 10:56.267
Down in tamil nadu?

10:56.335 --> 10:57.435
- Are you kiddin

10:57.503 --> 10:59.036
My uncle practically
runs the place.

10:59.104 --> 11:00.604
I've prayed there.
It's sick.

11:00.672 --> 11:02.239
- Tell me everything,
right now.

11:02.306 --> 11:05.141
- One sec,
I just gotta hit the loo,

11:05.209 --> 11:07.443
As those bastard
british imperialists would say.

11:07.510 --> 11:09.578
[laughter]

11:09.646 --> 11:12.952
Last time I was in india,
I was eight years old.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.022
And I stayed inside the whole
time playing video games.

11:15.090 --> 11:17.625
I gotta bone up.

11:17.692 --> 11:20.525
Fourth largest coal reserves
in the wld.

11:20.593 --> 11:23.025
- This is the best
old fashioned I have ever had.

11:23.093 --> 11:24.424
Where did you find
this bartender?

11:24.492 --> 11:27.025
- Oh, ah, I think,
I don't know.

11:27.093 --> 11:28.959
Like maybe the yellow pages?

11:29.027 --> 11:31.261
- There's no way
that you're paying him enough.

11:31.329 --> 11:33.463
- Well, if you want, I could
teach you the secret to great--

11:33.530 --> 11:35.597
- Shh!

11:35.665 --> 11:37.566
- Leslie.
- Ann, get over here.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.801
- I'm here, already.
- Good.

11:39.868 --> 11:41.769
Okay, do you think
this party's going well?

11:41.837 --> 11:43.470
I mean, can you see justin?
Is he having fun?

11:43.537 --> 11:48.110
- Justin is over there
talking to mark happily.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.112
- Okay, good.
Yeah, good.

11:50.180 --> 11:53.080
I'm just gonna casually
make my--

11:53.147 --> 11:56.049
- So my face is literally
on fire,

11:56.116 --> 11:57.750
But it's
this weird chemical

11:57.818 --> 12:00.252
So no one can see
the flames.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.387
Um, I'm dancing around,
freaking out.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.356
I end up having to dunk
my face

12:04.423 --> 12:05.657
Into a bucket of sand.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.325
- Unreal.
- Unreal?

12:07.392 --> 12:08.926
- Oh, my god.
That is unbelievable.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.094
- Oh, my god, that's--
isn't it, ann?

12:10.161 --> 12:11.528
Unbelievable.

12:11.595 --> 12:12.695
- It didn't happen to me.

12:12.762 --> 12:15.096
It was a kid I knew
from camp.

12:15.164 --> 12:18.065
But a great story
is a great story.

12:18.133 --> 12:19.233
Well, plus the kid
can't tell it.

12:19.301 --> 12:21.268
His mouth melted.

12:21.336 --> 12:22.836
[overlapping conversation]

12:22.904 --> 12:24.771
- Dinner is served.

12:24.839 --> 12:28.407
- Oh. Excellent.

12:30.143 --> 12:31.676
- Hi. Oh.

12:31.744 --> 12:35.412
I'm sorry, are we late?

12:35.480 --> 12:37.480
- What the hell are you doing?

12:37.548 --> 12:40.216
How could you invite wendy
when ron's here?

12:40.284 --> 12:41.284
He's gonna wrap her up
in his moustache

12:41.351 --> 12:42.552
And take her home.

12:42.619 --> 12:43.619
- We agreed that
we should invite

12:43.687 --> 12:44.787
Interesting people
for justin,

12:44.855 --> 12:46.288
And wendy is
an interesting person.

12:46.356 --> 12:47.390
And I've been telling you
for weeks

12:47.457 --> 12:48.491
That you should tell her
how you feel.

12:48.558 --> 12:49.592
Now's your chance.

12:49.660 --> 12:50.893
- Oh, yeah,
that makes sense.

12:50.961 --> 12:52.062
No, it doesn't!

12:52.130 --> 12:55.867
Not cool. At all!

12:55.935 --> 12:57.436
- He'll get over it.

12:57.504 --> 12:58.904
- No, I won't!

12:58.972 --> 13:02.907
- The first course
is a mexican bean soup.

13:02.975 --> 13:05.575
- Ooh. <i>Dios mio.</i>

13:05.643 --> 13:07.810
- Are these peppers
for consuming?

13:07.877 --> 13:09.478
- Uh, I wouldn't.
They're very hot.

13:09.545 --> 13:12.813
- I'm gonna give it a try.

13:12.881 --> 13:15.182
Mm. Hot.

13:15.249 --> 13:17.316
- You're very brave.

13:17.384 --> 13:19.217
- Please. That was one of
the tiny ones.

13:19.285 --> 13:21.186
#this is how you eat it#

13:24.589 --> 13:27.224
- Don't do that, tom.
- Mm. [bleep]!

13:30.528 --> 13:32.795
- Uh, um, uh--

13:32.863 --> 13:34.330
This is something.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.564
Justin, derek and ben
are gay.

13:35.632 --> 13:37.832
But often on occasion,

13:37.900 --> 13:40.735
April will have relations
with derek.

13:40.802 --> 13:43.203
Right? Crazy stuff.
Discuss that.

13:43.271 --> 13:45.605
- There's not much more
to discuss.

13:45.673 --> 13:46.839
You kind of explained it all.

13:46.907 --> 13:49.141
- [sighs]

13:49.209 --> 13:52.010
Who else is gay?

13:52.078 --> 13:53.979
Tom, I need your help.
There was a lull.

13:54.046 --> 13:55.680
I saw justin yawn.

13:55.748 --> 13:57.148
Please tell me that yawning
is a sign of excement

13:57.215 --> 13:58.515
In india or something.

13:58.583 --> 13:59.683
Tom, focus.
- Ah!

13:59.751 --> 14:01.384
- God, you're no help.

14:01.452 --> 14:03.519
Yes, just to be clear,
um,

14:03.587 --> 14:04.987
This will in no way
influence me.

14:05.055 --> 14:06.289
It won't affect my decision

14:06.356 --> 14:08.257
And it has no bearing
on the future of your class.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.592
- Hey, little buddy.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.194
Everything okay?

14:12.262 --> 14:13.595
That took a long time.

14:13.663 --> 14:16.164
- Mm, poor tommy.
He has a very frail colon.

14:16.232 --> 14:18.933
- I feel your pain,
brother.

14:19.001 --> 14:20.233
Hottest thing I ever put
into my mouth

14:20.301 --> 14:21.901
Was in this remote village
in southern brazil.

14:21.969 --> 14:23.036
- Ooh, this sounds good.
- Yeah.

14:23.103 --> 14:25.738
They take a little bit
of scorpion poison

14:25.805 --> 14:27.773
And they serve it to you--
[doorbell rings]

14:27.840 --> 14:29.107
- I wonder who that is.
- Oh.

14:29.175 --> 14:31.076
- Who could that be?
- More people.

14:31.143 --> 14:33.845
- A belly dancer?

14:33.913 --> 14:35.547
[laughs]
what?

14:35.614 --> 14:38.349
It's weird, but, uh,

14:38.417 --> 14:40.517
She just showed up.

14:40.585 --> 14:42.484
I mean,
I'm not the kind of person

14:42.552 --> 14:45.053
That's gonna throw
someone out or, you know,

14:45.121 --> 14:49.056
Not let them in
if they randomly show up.

14:49.124 --> 14:52.725
I--I don't know how
they all got here.

14:52.793 --> 14:54.960
You know, people hear about
a killer party

14:55.028 --> 14:57.962
At knope's house,
they all come a-runnin'.

15:01.898 --> 15:03.431
- You don't do origami
every day, do you?

15:03.499 --> 15:04.732
- They brought in
a little entertainment,

15:04.800 --> 15:06.233
Thank god.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.401
'cause that justin
is so boring.

15:08.468 --> 15:11.137
- What are you talking about?
He's incredible.

15:11.205 --> 15:13.339
- Yeah, he's not gay,
but if he were,

15:13.407 --> 15:14.907
I would totally break up
with ben for him.

15:14.974 --> 15:16.842
- Yeah, I would understand.

15:16.909 --> 15:18.176
He's amazing, right, April?

15:18.244 --> 15:20.111
- Right, April?
Don't we love him?

15:20.179 --> 15:21.879
[chuckles]

15:21.947 --> 15:26.950
- Yeah, he's actually
kind of awesome.

15:27.018 --> 15:28.719
- You're underage.

15:28.787 --> 15:30.053
I could lose my liquor license,
I'm sorry.

15:30.121 --> 15:31.221
- Andy.

15:31.288 --> 15:33.222
- Hey, are you having fun?

15:33.290 --> 15:36.490
- All I can say is this is
not what I was expecting.

15:36.558 --> 15:37.857
[bell rings]

15:37.924 --> 15:40.292
I cannot believe there's more.
- There's not.

15:43.028 --> 15:44.561
- Miss knope.

15:44.629 --> 15:46.396
I understand that
you're currently evaluating

15:46.464 --> 15:47.564
The rec center teachers.

15:47.632 --> 15:50.067
- You're doing what, leslie?

15:50.135 --> 15:52.703
- I demand an evaluation.

15:52.771 --> 15:54.970
- Okay.
What course do you teach?

15:55.038 --> 15:57.739
- When it comes to choosing
accounting software,

15:57.807 --> 16:00.142
There's no accounting
for taste.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.376
[chuckles]

16:01.444 --> 16:02.944
- [laughing]

16:03.012 --> 16:05.213
- The advantage
of quickbooks pro is that

16:05.281 --> 16:07.482
It's easy to assemble
a list of vendors--

16:07.549 --> 16:09.950
- Well, this is great.

16:10.017 --> 16:11.651
I'm heading home,

16:11.718 --> 16:14.386
So as not to have to be here
anymore.

16:14.454 --> 16:16.555
My office first thing
tomorrow.

16:16.623 --> 16:19.557
- Yeah, I think we're probably
gonna take off too.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.759
- The--the demonstration
takes another 45 minutes.

16:21.827 --> 16:23.026
- Yeah, guys, please.

16:23.094 --> 16:25.227
Everybody,
can you just stay, okay?

16:25.295 --> 16:28.329
Justin, would you--

16:28.397 --> 16:29.997
Oh, my god.

16:31.606 --> 16:32.691
- I promise you, miss knope,

16:32.691 --> 16:34.157
This disciplinary committee

16:34.225 --> 16:36.022
Will go over every detail
of what happened last night

16:36.090 --> 16:37.956
And we will determine
whether you are guilty

16:38.024 --> 16:39.758
Of abusing your power.

16:39.826 --> 16:41.993
Do you have anything
to say before we begin?

16:42.060 --> 16:45.598
- Just that
I'm looking forward

16:45.665 --> 16:47.201
To the truth coming out.

16:47.269 --> 16:49.670
- I would like to say
that leslie

16:49.738 --> 16:52.673
Is incapable of using people
for her own gain.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.274
- Thank you, tom.

16:54.342 --> 16:55.741
- But I can't because

16:55.809 --> 16:57.943
Leslie loves using people
for her own gain.

16:58.011 --> 16:59.712
- If I may, phil,

16:59.780 --> 17:01.881
I'd like to say something
to tom on the record.

17:01.949 --> 17:03.316
- This has all been
on the record.

17:03.383 --> 17:06.551
- I'm very sorry that
I invited wendy to the party.

17:06.618 --> 17:08.086
- Is wendy one of
the teachers?

17:08.154 --> 17:09.654
- No, she's my soon-to-be
ex-wife.

17:09.722 --> 17:12.490
- And hopefully
then-to-be future wife.

17:12.557 --> 17:14.156
Look, I'm really sorry.

17:14.224 --> 17:16.792
I put a new romance
in front of an old friendship.

17:16.859 --> 17:18.861
- Okay.

17:18.929 --> 17:20.530
- I put a beautiful man

17:20.597 --> 17:22.531
In front of
an adorable man child.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.166
- You're ruining it.

17:24.234 --> 17:25.535
- I put a big white stallion

17:25.603 --> 17:27.470
In front of
a little brown pony.

17:27.537 --> 17:29.138
- Totally uncalled for.

17:29.206 --> 17:31.140
- Ron swanson will be next.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.642
- When it comes
to government hearings,

17:33.710 --> 17:36.178
The only type of witness
I enjoy being

17:36.245 --> 17:37.845
Is a hostile one.

17:37.913 --> 17:39.947
That's why I intend
to answer

17:40.015 --> 17:43.983
Every one of their questions
with a question.

17:44.051 --> 17:46.752
- Were you aware that all of
the entertainment and food

17:46.820 --> 17:48.420
Was provided by
rec center teachers?

17:48.488 --> 17:51.256
- Would I have stayed
if I knew that?

17:51.324 --> 17:52.390
- I don't know.
Would you have?

17:52.458 --> 17:53.725
- Would <i>you</i> have?

17:53.793 --> 17:55.827
- No, I wouldn't have.

17:55.895 --> 17:58.797
Did you hear leslie
make any promises?

17:58.864 --> 18:00.598
- What constitutes
a promise?

18:00.666 --> 18:02.031
- A quid pro quo.

18:02.099 --> 18:04.031
- Oh. Do you know latin?

18:04.099 --> 18:06.698
- Okay. Thank you, ron.

18:06.766 --> 18:08.898
- Are we done?

18:08.965 --> 18:11.664
- Can I get a shine?

18:11.731 --> 18:15.097
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
We're closed.

18:15.165 --> 18:16.731
Due to betrayment.

18:16.799 --> 18:18.467
- Well, I'm sorry.

18:18.535 --> 18:19.836
But I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:19.903 --> 18:22.038
- Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

18:22.105 --> 18:26.041
Whose name is justin.
- Justin?

18:26.109 --> 18:27.242
- Yes.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.010
- I would,

18:29.078 --> 18:32.680
But he's probably
too busy...

18:32.748 --> 18:37.118
Cleaning gum
out of his coat pockets.

18:38.254 --> 18:42.090
- Wow. Unbetrayed.

18:42.158 --> 18:44.059
- So you don't work
for the government,

18:44.126 --> 18:46.127
And you had no idea
that these people

18:46.195 --> 18:47.795
Were teachers from
the local rec center.

18:47.863 --> 18:49.263
- No.

18:49.331 --> 18:50.865
I was simply attending a dinner
party at my friend's house.

18:50.933 --> 18:53.067
- Why is he here, ms. Knope?

18:53.135 --> 18:54.869
- That will become clear.

18:54.936 --> 18:56.903
Mr. Anderson, could you please
describe that evening?

18:56.971 --> 18:59.537
- Well, I had
a very pleasant time.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.835
And from my perspective,
there was no abuse of power

19:01.903 --> 19:04.735
With respect to ms. Knope
and any of her various guests.

19:04.803 --> 19:06.303
- Could you define pleasant?

19:06.371 --> 19:09.038
Did you have a good time?
Did you have a great time?

19:09.106 --> 19:11.007
Be specific, and do you remember
that you're under oath?

19:11.075 --> 19:13.542
- Mm-hmm.
I had an amazing time.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.444
- But you fell asleep.

19:15.512 --> 19:16.811
- Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

19:16.879 --> 19:18.613
No--look, I, uh,
you know,

19:18.681 --> 19:19.947
I'd been given a case
the night before.

19:20.015 --> 19:21.348
So I had to stay up
all night working on it.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.849
I didn't want to cancel.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.150
- You should have told me,
I would have rescheduled.

19:24.218 --> 19:25.718
- Are you kidding me?
I was looking forward to it.

19:25.786 --> 19:28.154
I had an awesome time.

19:28.222 --> 19:30.923
Which had nothing to do
with the rec center teachers.

19:30.990 --> 19:33.225
- No further questions.

19:33.293 --> 19:34.326
- Okay.

19:34.394 --> 19:35.728
We're going to take
a break,

19:35.796 --> 19:37.364
And we'll let you know
what we decide

19:37.432 --> 19:39.367
In about an hour.

19:39.435 --> 19:40.735
- Great.

19:40.803 --> 19:42.570
I will, uh, see you later.

19:42.638 --> 19:43.805
- I'm in the middle
of official business

19:43.873 --> 19:44.973
So I can't talk about it
right now.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.007
- Okay.
- But yes, yes, you will.

19:46.075 --> 19:47.475
- Great.

19:47.543 --> 19:51.611
- [clears throat]

19:51.678 --> 19:53.843
So did you get that?
He said "amazing" and "awesome."

19:53.911 --> 19:56.078
So I'm gonna drive up
and see him next weekend.

19:56.146 --> 19:58.147
There's some kabuki theater
festival happening.

19:58.215 --> 19:59.315
- Great.

19:59.382 --> 20:01.416
You're so relaxed.

20:01.484 --> 20:02.751
You're not freaking out
about this at all?

20:02.819 --> 20:04.186
- Okay, leslie.

20:04.253 --> 20:05.987
We've reached our decision.

20:06.055 --> 20:07.755
We're not going to take

20:07.823 --> 20:09.356
Any further action
at this time.

20:09.424 --> 20:11.159
- Thank you.

20:11.226 --> 20:13.294
- It really helped that you
asked for this hearing yourself

20:13.362 --> 20:15.396
And that you made
financial restitution

20:15.463 --> 20:16.763
Out of your own pocket.

20:16.831 --> 20:19.667
But I think we both know
you skirted a line here.

20:22.070 --> 20:24.604
- You turned yourself in?
Why?

20:24.672 --> 20:27.307
- Well, I did something wrong
and I felt bad.

20:27.375 --> 20:30.810
So this morning, I donated
$1,000 to the rec center

20:30.878 --> 20:33.379
So everybody could keep
teaching their classes.

20:33.447 --> 20:35.350
- Okay, so why did you
ask for the hearing?

20:35.417 --> 20:36.551
- Are you kidding, ann?

20:36.619 --> 20:38.486
It's every girl's dream
to ask a dude

20:38.554 --> 20:41.722
How their date went
under penalty of perjury.

20:41.790 --> 20:42.856
I'm not proud of my actions,

20:42.924 --> 20:44.458
But the most important thing
is there is now

20:44.525 --> 20:45.892
An official government
document

20:45.960 --> 20:48.561
That proves my dinner party
kicked ass.

20:52.516 --> 20:54.449
- Tommy hav.
- J-train.

20:54.517 --> 20:55.617
- What's up, buddy?

20:55.684 --> 20:59.252
This might be none of
my business, but...

20:59.320 --> 21:01.988
You need to ask wendy out.

21:02.056 --> 21:04.123
For reals this time.

21:04.191 --> 21:05.724
- Did leslie tell you?

21:05.792 --> 21:08.327
- No. She didn't need to.

21:08.395 --> 21:09.728
I saw it.

21:09.796 --> 21:11.563
- I'm not gay,

21:11.631 --> 21:13.665
But you're the most incredible
man I've ever met.

21:13.733 --> 21:16.532
- That doesn't sound gay
at all.

21:16.599 --> 21:17.864
See you later.

21:17.932 --> 21:19.232
- Take care.
- Bye, brother.

21:19.299 --> 21:19.931
- You sure you don't wanna
come hang out for a minute?
