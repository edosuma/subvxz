01:32.192 --> 01:34.160

01:34.194 --> 01:35.562
Harriette, do you know anyone

01:35.596 --> 01:38.164
who owns a black Porsche
with red pin striping?

01:38.198 --> 01:39.866
Oh, yeah, that's
Doug Perkins' new car.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.468
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have
to find this Perkins' guy

01:42.503 --> 01:44.204
and set him straight.

01:44.237 --> 01:45.405
Well, you're in luck,
here he comes now.

Aah, excuse me.

Are you the owner of the new
Porsche in the parking lot?

Stop! Right there!

01:52.913 --> 01:54.515
I'm in your space, right?

Hey, I know what
you're thinking.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.318
But I can explain.

01:58.351 --> 02:01.254
I've got a new car and your
space is right next to the wall.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.889
So there's less chance of dings.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.391
But listen I've got
your best interests at heart.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.662

you can park in mine.

But when I get one, it's yours.

it is a Porsche.

things you've got to know

07:40.527 --> 07:42.262
about the Mypiot right upfront.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.465
Number one, we all
enjoy a good pomegranate.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.638
That one don't apply here.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.241
But the next one does.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.044
We don't demand
things like raises.

07:58.078 --> 08:02.082
We believe that if
we sow the seeds of hard work

08:02.115 --> 08:05.251
and water them
with a cheerful attitude

08:05.285 --> 08:07.854
then a tree
of blessings will take root

08:07.888 --> 08:11.858
and grow and then we will reap
the fruit of our labors.

08:13.727 --> 08:17.097

the aforementioned pomegranate.

me to cover my eyes first.

and I'll tell you what you see.

When someone tries
to make you do something

10:02.102 --> 10:05.739
you don't want to do,
you just tell them 'Stop.'

In this case, I'm not hungry.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.242

me in the first place, I‐‐

me what to tell you?

I'm telling you to tell me

but if you tell me what it is
you want me to stop telling you

10:20.787 --> 10:21.855
I'll stop telling it to you.

that's what they teach you

11:45.371 --> 11:46.740
at STOP training.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.075
People, especially women..

11:49.109 --> 11:51.144
...like it
when you talk to them like that.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.051
‐ They do?
‐ Yes.

11:58.084 --> 11:59.853
We‐well,
they don't like it at first

11:59.886 --> 12:02.122
but pretty soon they learn

12:02.155 --> 12:04.758
that you're doing them a favor.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.228
You think
you're doing her a favor

12:08.261 --> 12:10.396
by talking down to her
like you talk down to me?

12:10.430 --> 12:11.364
Exactly.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.801
You see, Balki, at STOP

12:14.835 --> 12:16.537
we learn that bending people

12:16.570 --> 12:18.905
to your will..

12:18.939 --> 12:21.141
...is the most
unselfish thing you can do.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.914
Cousin, I believe
in being nice to others.

12:27.948 --> 12:31.184
Well, of course you do,
and I do too.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.253
But before you can be
nice to other people

12:33.286 --> 12:36.022
you have to be nice to yourself.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.524
‐ Really?
‐ Yes.

12:37.558 --> 12:40.093
Balki, how do you feel

12:40.126 --> 12:43.463
when you see other people
get what they want?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.398
‐ I feel happy.
‐ Right.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.100
And other people will be happy

12:47.133 --> 12:49.803
when they see you
get what you want.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.471
‐ Really?
‐ Yes.

12:51.505 --> 12:53.840
So if you want
other people to be happy

12:53.874 --> 12:56.242
you have to take what you want.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.578
Even if it doesn't
make them happy

12:57.611 --> 12:59.045
while you are taking it.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.118
‐ Let me get this straight.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.488
I can make others happy

13:08.522 --> 13:11.157
by taking what I want

13:11.191 --> 13:13.860
even if it makes them unhappy
while I'm taking it

13:13.894 --> 13:17.263
because they don't realize
how happy they're going to be

13:17.297 --> 13:18.899
after I have gotten it.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.269
Ooh, you're good.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.974
‐ You are a STOP natural.
‐ I..

13:28.008 --> 13:29.042
‐ You are, I mean it.
‐ No.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.977
I mean it.
Yes, yes, you are.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.614
Balki, I am going to teach you

13:33.647 --> 13:36.249
how to get your raise.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.220
This is your raise.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.924
Cousin, this is a cantaloupe.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.863
Now cantaloupes are nice..

13:49.896 --> 13:52.599
...but I was hoping for money.

13:55.101 --> 13:58.304
Balki, this cantaloupe

13:58.338 --> 14:00.907
represents your raise.

14:00.941 --> 14:01.975
Alright, here, stand over here.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.910
Stand over here. Uh‐huh.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.145
Now..

14:06.379 --> 14:09.449
...all you have to do
to get your raise

14:09.482 --> 14:11.918
is to walk over here

14:11.952 --> 14:13.920
and take it.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.021
Not yet.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.025
Alright, now.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.627
Balki..

14:20.661 --> 14:22.295
...concentrate

14:22.328 --> 14:25.198
commit to your goal.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.033
Don't let any obstacles

14:27.067 --> 14:30.070
come between you and your raise.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.137
Are you ready
to go get your raise?

14:33.473 --> 14:34.374
Go.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.047
Is that a spider on your neck?

14:43.617 --> 14:45.385
Don't step on the Dimitri.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.355
‐ Too bad about Wayne Newton.
‐ Something happened to Wayne?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.991
‐ Ah‐ha!
‐ Oh.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.666
Cousin, I don't know
if I can do this.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.035
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.670
All we have to do..

15:03.704 --> 15:06.406
...is focus your anger.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.274
[chuckles]
I don't have any anger.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.143
Oh, yes, you do.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.645
[laughs]

15:11.678 --> 15:13.514
‐ No, I don't.
‐ Yes, you do.

15:13.547 --> 15:14.681
‐ No, I don't.
‐ Yes, you do.

15:14.715 --> 15:15.982
‐ No, I don't.
‐ Yes, you do.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.418
I don't have any anger!

15:23.489 --> 15:25.091
Where do you think
that come from?

15:26.492 --> 15:30.363
Balki, that is the anger
you have for Mr. Gorpley.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.132
The man who promised you a raise

15:32.165 --> 15:34.568
and then viciously
took it away from you!

15:36.336 --> 15:38.438
Well, I'll be snookered.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.009
I didn't know that was in there.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.079
Well, there's a lot more
where that came from.

15:47.748 --> 15:50.551
Don't you send half
your paycheck home to your mama?

15:50.584 --> 15:51.818
Yes, yes, I do.

15:51.852 --> 15:55.455
That way she don't have to work
so hard in her golden years.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.692
So, wouldn't you have sent half
your raise home to your mama?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.493
Well, yes, I would.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.428
So by taking money away from you

16:02.462 --> 16:06.032
Mr. Gorpley is taking money
away from your mama.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.671
What kind of man would steal

16:10.704 --> 16:13.039
from a kindly, old woman?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.240
‐ A bad man.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.141
And..

16:15.175 --> 16:17.578
...and how does that
make you feel, Balki?

16:17.611 --> 16:18.679
[crying]
Awful.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.547
How does that make you feel?

16:20.581 --> 16:22.516
‐ Bad.
‐ How does that make you feel?

16:22.549 --> 16:26.219
That makes me angry!

16:26.252 --> 16:29.322
Good! Good! Good!
Put me down!

16:29.355 --> 16:31.291
Alright, now what are you
going to do with that anger?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.227
I'm going to use it
to get what I want!

16:34.260 --> 16:36.029
And why are you
going to get what you want?

16:36.062 --> 16:39.199
‐ Because I'm selfish!
‐ And why are you selfish?

16:39.232 --> 16:42.468
Because I want
to make people happy!

16:42.503 --> 16:45.038
‐ Yes, yes, you've got it.
‐ Happy!

16:45.071 --> 16:46.339
‐ You've got it.
‐ Ha, ha, ha!

16:48.809 --> 16:50.744
[instrumental music]

16:52.178 --> 16:53.814
(Larry)
'Balki, go in there'

16:53.847 --> 16:55.582
'and get your raise.'

17:01.221 --> 17:04.223
Alright, Mr. Gorpley..

17:04.257 --> 17:05.491
...you can run..

17:07.292 --> 17:09.229
...but you cannot ride.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.068
[door slams]

17:26.479 --> 17:28.114
Stop!

17:29.783 --> 17:33.219
Last week I asked you
very nicely to move your car.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.488
You refused.
I let you get away with it.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.123
Well, those days are over.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.759
I want you out of my space

17:38.792 --> 17:41.294
and I want you out now.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.162
Oh, man!

17:42.195 --> 17:44.731
You've been to STOP seminar,
haven't you?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.502
Yes, I have.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.403
I went to that seminar
last week.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.105
That's why I took your space.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.674
I thought
it would make you happy.

17:55.509 --> 17:58.111
Then I spent the whole weekend
telling my wife where to get off

17:58.144 --> 18:00.146
she threw me out.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.749
Just went upstairs,
demanded a raise..

18:02.783 --> 18:03.850
...I was fired.

18:04.818 --> 18:07.387
STOP ruined my life.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.690
Do yourself a favor!

18:09.723 --> 18:10.857
Forget everything
they told you..

18:10.891 --> 18:12.826
...before it's too late!

18:26.306 --> 18:27.608
Balki.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.916
Uh, Mr. Gorpley, Mr. Gorpley.

18:35.949 --> 18:39.352
Mr. Gorpley, uh,
if‐if you see Balki before I do

18:39.385 --> 18:41.922
you should know
that‐that‐that he was, he was

18:41.955 --> 18:43.790
uh, he was hypnotized at a party

18:43.824 --> 18:44.858
and thinks he's General Patton.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.897
If this is some sob story
about the Mypion's raise

18:50.931 --> 18:52.533
save your breath.

18:52.566 --> 18:53.934
Over the weekend
I thought about it

18:53.967 --> 18:56.269
and I decided to give it to him.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.303
You did?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.644
Balki! Balki!
Hey, Balki!

19:03.677 --> 19:06.379
Listen, buddy, listen.
Balki! Balki! Balki!

19:06.412 --> 19:08.314
Change o' plan.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.852
Balki! Balki!

19:11.885 --> 19:13.554
You got your raise!

19:13.587 --> 19:16.289
Of course I did.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.892
Balki! Balki!
You cannot do this!

19:19.793 --> 19:23.163
Out of my way, little man.

19:24.765 --> 19:27.901
I have a date with dynasty.

19:29.570 --> 19:30.904
Balki! Balki!

19:30.937 --> 19:33.874
You have got to stop STOP!

19:33.907 --> 19:37.243
Cousin, if you don't want
to make the trip to success

19:37.277 --> 19:39.445
then get out of the road.

19:45.586 --> 19:46.953
[clanking]

19:49.956 --> 19:51.625
Ah, Bartokomous‐‐

19:51.658 --> 19:52.759
Stop!

19:53.960 --> 19:56.563
Excuse me?

19:56.597 --> 19:58.231
Nobody takes money

19:58.264 --> 20:00.867
out of my mama's mouth.

20:00.901 --> 20:03.770
What are you talking about?

20:03.804 --> 20:06.406
I'm talking
about my mama's mouth

20:06.439 --> 20:09.510
and the act of taking
money out of it.

20:11.745 --> 20:13.647
I deserve a raise.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.982
Therefore, it's mine.

20:16.016 --> 20:18.752
I demand it now.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.222
Let me get this straight.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.760
You are demanding a raise?

20:26.793 --> 20:28.662
You got that right

20:28.695 --> 20:30.997
you Mypiot mother mugger.

20:34.768 --> 20:36.670
Do you know what this is?

20:36.703 --> 20:40.306
[blowing a raspberry]
It's a piece of paper.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.942
Yes.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.678
But not just any piece of paper.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.347
This is the authorization
for your raise.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.482
I was just taking it
up to payroll.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.585
Well, of course you were.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.687
Don't be ridiculous.

20:55.656 --> 20:57.524
I got my raise?

20:57.558 --> 20:59.359
You had it.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.463
Now you don't.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.909
Balki, Balki, what happened?

21:18.579 --> 21:20.581
Balki!
What are you doing?

21:21.815 --> 21:23.984
I'm focusing my anger.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.390
[instrumental music]

21:33.660 --> 21:35.395
Cousin, great news!

21:35.428 --> 21:37.764
Mr. Gorpley give me
my raise back.

21:37.798 --> 21:40.333
Oh, that's great, Balki. I'd..

21:40.366 --> 21:42.903
I'm afraid
I owe you a big apology

21:42.936 --> 21:45.606
and I hope Mr. Gorpley
wasn't too hard on you.

21:45.639 --> 21:48.008
Actually,
all I had to do was tell him

21:48.041 --> 21:51.044
that I had been listening to you
and that seemed to be enough.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.016
[sighs]

21:57.450 --> 21:58.484
Balki, I‐I don't know

21:58.519 --> 22:01.822
how I bought that STOP business.

22:01.855 --> 22:04.725
I mean, I‐I‐I just wanted to
be able to stand up for myself

22:04.758 --> 22:07.427
so that people
wouldn't walk all over me.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.863
I just thought that a little
aggressiveness would help.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.065
Cousin, it's okay
to stand up for yourself

22:12.098 --> 22:15.135
as long as
you don't stand on other people.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.538
You know,
on Mypos we have a saying.

22:17.571 --> 22:19.072
Would you care
to hear it in the original?

22:19.105 --> 22:21.975
‐ No, translation would be fine.
‐ Okay.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.845
It says,
"You get more flies with honey

22:24.878 --> 22:26.513
than with a rifle."

22:33.554 --> 22:35.522
I would think so, yes.

22:38.859 --> 22:41.427
So anyway it's okay
as long as you learned a lesson.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.930
Oh, eh, uh, Balki, I have.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.966
And never again will I jump

22:45.999 --> 22:48.902
into something
like this blindly.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.171
Well, the good news is
that we've taken care

22:51.204 --> 22:53.540
of all the harm
that's been done.

22:53.574 --> 22:54.675
[knock on door]

22:54.708 --> 22:56.510
(both)
Come in!

22:57.544 --> 22:58.411
(Larry)
'Oh, Jennifer.'

22:58.444 --> 23:00.714
Larry, I've been
thinking about the way

23:00.747 --> 23:01.715
you treated me the other night.

23:01.748 --> 23:02.949
Yes, about that I..

23:05.886 --> 23:08.388
Don't ever talk to me
that way again.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.901
Cousin, it was a sucker punch.

23:20.934 --> 23:22.068
You'll get her next time.
