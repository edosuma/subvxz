-Sam?

DEAN: This is bigger than you think.
They're everywhere.

00:04.714 --> 00:07.216
SAM: This demon killed Mom
and Jess, and Dad's closing in.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.884
-We gotta help.
-Dad doesn't want our help.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.596
I'm talking one week here, man.
To get answers. To get revenge.

00:12.847 --> 00:15.516
-You think I didn't respect Dad.
-Sorry I brought it up.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.518
SAM: No matter what,
it was never good enough.

00:17.727 --> 00:21.355
-So, what, Dad was disappointed in you?
-When we finally do find Dad...

00:21.564 --> 00:23.774
...I don't know if he's even gonna
wanna see me.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.777
-Hey. Dad?
JOHN: Hey, boys.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.029
-Hi, Sam.
-Hey, Dad.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.574
Last time we were together
we had one hell of a fight.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.201
-Yes, sir.
-It's good to see you again.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.245
It's been a long time.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.331
We almost got Dad killed in there.
They're not gonna stop.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.834
DEAN: They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.419
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.547
-I gotta be a part of this fight.
-Sammy, this fight is just starting.

You gotta let me go.

Mr. Elkins?

01:13.407 --> 01:16.327
Mr. Elkins. Would you like another?

01:17.453 --> 01:19.163
Yeah. Thanks, Beth.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.460
Thought they caught the Unabomber.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.463
Yeah, poor Mr. Elkins lives all alone,

Same seat every day.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.302

and making his little notes.

He's a nice old man, he's just a nut.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.214
-Jack all around. Leave the bottle.
-You hungry?

02:11.257 --> 02:14.301
-We have dinner plans.
-Okay.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.178
Hmm.

02:16.387 --> 02:19.390
Can I get you something else,
Mr. Elkins?

03:07.021 --> 03:08.564
It's been a while.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.691
I gotta say, you look old.

Well, I've been scanning Wyoming,
Colorado, South Dakota.

04:56.005 --> 05:00.884
Here, a woman in Iowa fell 10,000 feet
from an airplane and survived.

than Twilight Zone.

05:04.013 --> 05:06.265
-Yeah.
-Hey, you know...

...we could just keep heading east.

You could stop by
and see Sarah again, huh?

You two seemed pretty friendly.

Yeah, I don't know. Maybe someday.
But in the meantime...

05:22.656 --> 05:25.409
...we got a lot of work to do, Dean,
and you know that.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.454
Yeah, you're right. What else you got?

05:29.038 --> 05:32.541
Uh, Manning, Colorado. A local man
by the name of Daniel Elkins...

05:32.791 --> 05:37.463
-...was found mauled in his home.
-Elkins? I know that name.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.631
-Doesn't ring a bell.
-Elkins. Elkins. Elkins.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.467
The police don't know what to think.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.261
SAM: At first they said
it was some bear attack...

05:44.344 --> 05:46.555
...and now they found signs
of robbery.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.931
Mm-hm.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.475
Yeah.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.440
There. Check it out.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.531
-Think it's the same Elkins?
-It's a Colorado area code.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.198
Looks like the maid didn't come today.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.414
Hey, there's salt here,
right inside the door.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.542
You mean like
protection-against-demons salt...

06:56.750 --> 06:58.502
...or oops-I-spilled-the-popcorn salt?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.712
It's clearly a ring.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.719
SAM:
You think this guy Elkins was a player?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.638
DEAN:
Definitely.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.024
SAM:
That looks a hell of a lot like Dad's.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.154
Yeah, except this dates back
to the '60s.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.973
SAM: Whatever attacked him,
it looks like there was more than one.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.225
Looks like he put up
a hell of a fight too.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.019
Yeah.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.298
You got something?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.844
I don't know.
Some scratches in the floor.

08:31.053 --> 08:34.681
-Death throes, maybe?
-Yeah, maybe.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.744
Or maybe a message.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.706
Look familiar?

09:02.376 --> 09:03.877
Three letters, six digits.

09:04.086 --> 09:07.547
The location and combination
of a post office box.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.634
-It's a mail drop.
-It's just the way Dad does it.

What are you doing here?
Are you all right?

09:46.295 --> 09:47.754
Yeah, I'm okay.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.881
Look, I read the news about Daniel.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.675
I got here as fast as I could.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.429
I saw you two up at his place.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.224
-Why didn't you come in, Dad?
-You know why.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.601
Because I had to make sure
you weren't followed...

10:01.810 --> 10:05.314
...by anyone or anything.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.775
Nice job of covering your tracks,
by the way.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.611
Yeah, well, we learned from the best.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.614
Wait, so you came all the way out here
for this Elkins guy?

10:15.157 --> 10:17.951
Yeah. He was....

10:18.410 --> 10:20.037
He was a good man.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.831
He taught me a hell of a lot
about hunting.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.167
Well, you never mentioned him to us.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.627
We had a....

10:28.587 --> 10:31.131
We had kind of a falling-out.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.633
I hadn't seen him in years.

I should look at that.

I'm already dead."

-What is it?

10:52.778 --> 10:54.738
-He had it the whole time.
-Dad, what?

10:54.946 --> 10:57.574
When you searched the place,
did you see a gun?

10:57.783 --> 10:59.993
An antique, a Colt revolver.
Did you see it?

11:00.202 --> 11:02.079
Uh, there was an old case,
but it was empty.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.039
-They have it.
-You mean whatever killed Elkins?

11:04.247 --> 11:06.750
We gotta pick up the trail.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.505
-Wait, you want us to come with you?
-If Elkins was telling the truth...

11:11.755 --> 11:13.840
-...we've gotta find this gun.
-The gun? Why?

11:14.049 --> 11:17.469
-Because it's important, that's why.
-We don't know what these things are.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.305
JOHN: They were what
Daniel Elkins killed best:

11:20.514 --> 11:21.681
Vampires.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.227
Vampires?
I thought there was no such thing.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.978
You never even mentioned them, Dad.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.856
I thought they were extinct.

11:30.315 --> 11:34.069
I thought Elkins and others
had wiped them out.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.824
I was wrong.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.744
JOHN:
Most vampire lore is crap.

11:42.828 --> 11:46.206
A cross won't repel them,
sunlight won't kill them...

11:46.873 --> 11:50.419
...and neither will a stake to the heart.
But the blood lust, that part's true.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.629
They need fresh human blood
to survive.

11:52.838 --> 11:55.632
They were once people, so you won't
know it's a vampire until it's too late.

-What happened?

-How do you know?

No fangs, teeth. A second set descends
when they attack.

to that 911 couple.

That's probably what Dad's thinking.

Course, it would be nice
if he just told us what he thinks.

-He barks orders at us, Dean.

He expects us to follow them
without question.

It's from an old friend of yours,
Daniel Elkins.

17:41.311 --> 17:44.856
I caught his scent
and I thought I'd surprise you.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.649
Kate, what did you do?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.986
-I made him suffer.
-You shouldn't have done that.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.988
-Luther--
-There are others like him.

Looks like it was made
around the time you were born.

-I've seen this before.
-Elkins died with it in his hands.

18:23.812 --> 18:27.524
He should've known better,
using a gun.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.778
This is no ordinary gun.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.072
Yeah, Dad. All right, got it.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.865
-Pull off the next exit.
-Why?

18:36.074 --> 18:39.369
-Dad thinks we've got the vampires' trail.
-How?

23:08.429 --> 23:11.474
...the same night those men
died at the Alamo...

23:11.766 --> 23:14.310
...they say Samuel Colt made a gun.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.104
A special gun.

23:16.187 --> 23:20.608
He made it for a hunter.
A man like us, only on horseback.

23:21.442 --> 23:24.070
The story goes, he made 13 bullets.

23:25.238 --> 23:28.658
This hunter used the gun
a half dozen times...

the gun along with him.

...into a savings account for you.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.308

37:33.585 --> 37:36.630
Is that what this is about?
I mean, you can't shoot us all.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.715
We'll kill you.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.426
Oh, I don't need it for you.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.637
I'm saving it for something else.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.349
Put the Colt down or she goes first.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.102
All right.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.270
Just don't hurt her.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.697
Back up.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.158
Further.

38:17.170 --> 38:18.922
It's a nice move. You almost made it.

38:26.555 --> 38:27.639
(GLASS SHATTERING)

38:49.202 --> 38:53.206
Nope. I'll break his neck.
Put the blade down.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.210
(GRUNTING)

39:07.304 --> 39:09.347
You people.

39:09.431 --> 39:11.558
Why can't you just leave us alone?

39:11.808 --> 39:15.062
-We have as much right to live as you do.
JOHN: I don't think so.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.131
(SCREAMING)
Luther!

39:59.356 --> 40:01.149
Kate, don't!

40:26.967 --> 40:28.635
So, boys....

40:33.098 --> 40:34.266
Yes, sir?

40:34.474 --> 40:36.935
You ignored a direct order back there.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.229
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah, but we saved your ass.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.611
You're right.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.782
-I am?
-It scares the hell out of me.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.659
You two are all I've got...

40:55.662 --> 40:58.331
...but I guess we are stronger
as a family.

40:59.749 --> 41:03.879
So we go after this damn thing.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.548
Together.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.925
(IN UNISON)
Yes, sir.
