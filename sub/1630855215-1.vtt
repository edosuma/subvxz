00:19.620 --> 00:20.793
<i>Sofía, right?</i>

00:20.931 --> 00:23.482
I wasn't
sure if you needed this back.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.551
It turns out we're actually
gonna need that leash back.

00:27.379 --> 00:30.482
- Maggie, I want
to see you tonight.
- It'll be on my playing field.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.551
<i>Fuck, we're not going
to church, are we?</i>

00:32.689 --> 00:34.068
<i>You didn't fucking deserve him.</i>

00:34.206 --> 00:35.620
<i>None of you did.</i>

00:37.827 --> 00:39.793
Hope, get in the car.
You need to come with me.

00:39.931 --> 00:41.793
Coco wouldn't want you out here,

00:41.931 --> 00:44.103
<i>and I don't want you out here.</i>

00:46.655 --> 00:49.931
We forgive each other's
trespasses. Move forward.

00:50.068 --> 00:53.172
Fuck your trespasses
and fuck your king.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.793
My boy. He needs a name.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.758
Maverick.

00:59.896 --> 01:00.862
There's a way out, Neron.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.206
You go in,
you give us information.

01:03.344 --> 01:06.034
<i>You walk. We don't want
an individual,</i>

01:06.172 --> 01:07.724
<i>- we want the club.</i>
- <i>I shot and killed</i>

01:07.862 --> 01:09.344
nine people in Nuñez Park.

01:09.482 --> 01:10.896
These are my crimes,

01:11.034 --> 01:12.379
and I fully confess.

01:12.517 --> 01:13.620
What's up?

01:13.758 --> 01:15.413
Yuma, Stockton,

01:15.551 --> 01:17.896
Oakland, they left here
to go meet without us.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.206
Oh, shit!

01:19.344 --> 01:21.172
Don't move.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.344
Get your fucking hands up.

01:23.482 --> 01:25.034
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:25.172 --> 01:28.275
You get to be my little
Judas Wolf.

01:28.413 --> 01:30.344
A fire is coming.

01:34.275 --> 01:35.724
The fuck?

01:35.862 --> 01:37.310
Miguel will serve
as my appointed liaison

01:37.448 --> 01:39.172
north of the border.

01:39.310 --> 01:40.551
I'm going to need you
to take three times

01:40.689 --> 01:41.931
the original agreement
with my brother.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.068
You have this quantity?

01:44.206 --> 01:45.965
I trust you two
can work together

01:46.103 --> 01:48.448
to facilitate
this new arrangement.

01:48.586 --> 01:49.655
I want Alvarez out.

01:49.793 --> 01:51.551
I vote for "war."

01:51.689 --> 01:52.896
Call for a kill switch.

01:53.034 --> 01:55.862
Bishop, I want
to make you my VP.

No.

Nothing?

07:08.172 --> 07:10.103
Good morning?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.551
Yo, why you being so weird?

07:25.551 --> 07:26.862
I was just wondering if

07:27.000 --> 07:29.275
maybe there was something
you wanted to say to me,

07:29.413 --> 07:31.655
today of all days.

07:31.793 --> 07:34.793
Uh...

07:34.931 --> 07:36.413
Happy Wednesday?

07:42.206 --> 07:43.827
It's Friday.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.379
Happy birthday!

07:52.586 --> 07:53.793
- Happy birthday, man.
- Yeah, baby.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.172
- Come on.
- My man.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.517
Yeah, brother.

07:59.586 --> 08:01.724
Happy birthday, old man.

08:10.689 --> 08:12.586
They're waiting for us.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.689
Hey, P.

08:24.724 --> 08:27.310
Uh, I know you're
into reading and stuff.

08:27.448 --> 08:28.758
Saw this.

08:30.172 --> 08:32.758
Jess and Cielo wrapped it.

08:34.103 --> 08:36.379
Thought the title was cool.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.137
It's a classic.

08:38.275 --> 08:39.793
You've read it?

08:41.482 --> 08:44.000
Not like I should have.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.172
Not like I will now. Thank you.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.517
And, uh,

08:51.655 --> 08:54.000
thanks for remembering
my birthday.

08:54.137 --> 08:55.896
Whatever.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.689
Out of my way, man.

09:02.448 --> 09:05.310
With Tito and Mick out,
Orange County's gone.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.413
What about the rest
of the fucking charter?

09:08.551 --> 09:10.862
Handed their kuttes in.
War's taken its toll.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.241
Mick's in a coma and,

09:13.379 --> 09:15.275
well, Tito, it's early, but...

09:15.413 --> 09:16.862
he won't be the same.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.103
You know they pissed
on him, right?

09:19.241 --> 09:21.793
While Tito was having a seizure
from the brain trauma,

09:21.931 --> 09:23.241
this fucker pulled out his dick

09:23.379 --> 09:25.103
and pissed all over
his California patch.

09:25.241 --> 09:27.275
Right in front of Tito's girl.

09:27.413 --> 09:29.379
Fuck, I want to kill
this motherfucker.

09:29.517 --> 09:30.965
We will.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.586
We never should've
asked them to set up shop

09:32.724 --> 09:35.413
in the middle
of Sons' territory.

09:41.862 --> 09:43.758
It was my call.

09:43.896 --> 09:46.172
We had to battle
their expansion.

09:48.103 --> 09:49.034
Inland Empire.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.551
We got it.

09:50.689 --> 09:52.448
It's a solid bunch of brothers.
We'll hold it down.

09:52.586 --> 09:54.241
You're the last stand
between us and them.

09:54.379 --> 09:56.758
Inland Empire, Santo Padre,

09:56.896 --> 09:58.517
we're the last
of Southern California.

09:58.655 --> 10:00.034
And up north?

10:00.172 --> 10:02.448
- Oakland, Stockton?
- No change.

10:02.586 --> 10:06.068
Charming's keeping
their own treaty with Diaz.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.862
Staying out of it for now.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.379
Both sides are hoping it'll
just play out in the south.

10:10.517 --> 10:12.172
If Charming gave a fuck
about peace,

10:12.310 --> 10:14.000
they wouldn't be having
this fucking psychopath

10:14.137 --> 10:15.482
run wild, man.

10:15.620 --> 10:18.413
Isaac and SamDino attacking us
does not hurt Charming.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.275
Treaty or not,
we will always be enemies.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.758
So let's fucking hurt them.

10:23.896 --> 10:26.137
You hit Charming,
you killed everybody up north.

10:26.275 --> 10:27.827
Diaz has sent

10:27.965 --> 10:29.689
brother after brother
down here to help

10:29.827 --> 10:31.551
with this, including me.

10:31.689 --> 10:33.517
If anything goes off up there,

10:33.655 --> 10:35.758
Oakland and Stockton
are surrounded,

10:35.896 --> 10:37.862
undermanned, and exposed.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.241
Like we all fucking are
down here.

10:40.379 --> 10:41.310
Fuck Diaz.

10:41.448 --> 10:42.620
- Fuck Diaz?
- Fuck Diaz.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.137
Is that what we're doing here?
Fuck me?

10:44.275 --> 10:45.827
You got a problem with that,
motherfucker, come at me.

10:52.827 --> 10:54.965
We appreciate Diaz
sharing his resources.

10:55.103 --> 10:57.517
We appreciate

10:57.655 --> 10:59.896
the sacrifices that
you've all had to make.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.551
So when do we see the return
on all the sacrifice?

11:02.689 --> 11:04.758
We're bleeding money.

11:04.896 --> 11:06.517
Bleeding men.

11:06.655 --> 11:10.344
You chose this war to be able
to call yourselves California.

11:10.482 --> 11:11.793
What about the rest of us?

11:11.931 --> 11:13.931
Alvarez had offered peace.

11:14.068 --> 11:17.172
We followed you
up this hill instead.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.896
So when are you gonna
make sure that we

11:20.034 --> 11:21.517
don't fucking die on it?

11:21.655 --> 11:23.172
We get the pipeline back.

11:23.310 --> 11:24.482
How are you gonna do that?

11:24.620 --> 11:26.482
That bitch blames us
for the fucking warehouse.

11:26.620 --> 11:27.862
Whoever burned that heroin

11:28.000 --> 11:29.862
effectively tried to murder
everyone in this room.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.758
When we find them, no amount
of pain will be enough.

11:32.896 --> 11:33.793
Yeah, but what about right now?

11:33.931 --> 11:36.000
What about the brothers
locked up?

11:36.137 --> 11:37.931
Without the pipeline
keeping them safe,

11:38.068 --> 11:39.517
they're dead men walking.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.344
We're losing
this fucking thing, man.

11:41.482 --> 11:43.241
On all sides.

11:43.379 --> 11:45.793
Let me figure out
how to get back in

11:45.931 --> 11:47.344
with El Banquero's sister.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.689
In the meantime,
we're gonna jam up

11:51.827 --> 11:54.103
those other motherfuckers in
a big way today. We good for it?

11:54.241 --> 11:55.413
Everything's in place.

11:55.551 --> 11:56.896
Suicide mission.

11:57.034 --> 11:58.724
You're not invited, so you
don't got to worry about it.

11:58.862 --> 12:00.586
Santo Padre's gonna
take this one alone.

12:00.724 --> 12:02.448
Can't always take
all the glory, homie.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.206
Fuck glory.

12:04.344 --> 12:05.724
Bullet comes after
one of my brothers,

12:05.862 --> 12:07.206
it's got to go through me first.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.172
- Were you there?
- What?

12:27.310 --> 12:28.551
When they pulled the trigger?
Were you there?

12:28.689 --> 12:30.551
- What the fuck
are you talking about?
- Huh?

12:30.689 --> 12:32.482
- That's Ibarra's kid.
- Let's go, motherfucker.
Were you there?

12:32.620 --> 12:34.137
- Get out of my face, man.
- When they shot my father
in the back of the head?

12:34.275 --> 12:35.551
- Like <i>pinche</i> cowards!
- Hey, hey, not now, bro.

I think your fat ass

17:11.758 --> 17:12.862
and you're making me
do all the work.

17:15.931 --> 17:17.241
- And what the fuck
are you doing?
- It's hot.

17:17.379 --> 17:19.827
Those are heavy.

17:19.965 --> 17:21.448

17:23.586 --> 17:26.068

to a footrace,

17:28.206 --> 17:30.586
this club is doomed.

17:30.724 --> 17:32.517
You're fucking letting Pocahontas

17:32.655 --> 17:34.344

17:34.482 --> 17:37.793
Hey, they're prospects.
That's their fucking job.

lazy piece of shit a beer.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.689

- So help me,

17:52.827 --> 17:56.034
prospect, if you get
this fat fuck a beer,

17:56.172 --> 17:57.655
I will smash you.

18:06.862 --> 18:09.448

18:45.758 --> 18:47.586
Holy shit.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.793
That ain't half of it.

18:54.448 --> 18:55.724

19:00.931 --> 19:03.413

Let's go. Oh, shit.

19:17.379 --> 19:19.758
- Hey!
- Damn it.

19:19.896 --> 19:21.620
Hey, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

19:21.758 --> 19:23.620
I've been warning you,
and now you've been served.

19:23.758 --> 19:25.206
You're just gonna fucking
kick us out on the street?

19:25.344 --> 19:26.689
You're a full year behind.

19:26.827 --> 19:28.931
I told you that we would
come up with the money, okay?

19:29.068 --> 19:31.241
I didn't know that Coco
wasn't paying for the rent.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.793
Not my problem.
My family has to eat.

19:33.931 --> 19:35.241
Oh, it's not
your fucking problem? Yeah?

19:35.379 --> 19:36.862
Well, eat this, motherfucker.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.758
You got a week. Then I'll be
back with the police.

19:39.896 --> 19:43.034
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

19:44.793 --> 19:46.896
Fuck!

19:52.310 --> 19:53.551
Fuck.

19:55.241 --> 19:57.344
<i>It may not
look like much now, but</i>

19:57.482 --> 19:59.344
with the right architect
and interior designer,

19:59.482 --> 20:01.551
with these tall ceilings...

20:01.689 --> 20:04.931
Are full of bat shit.

20:05.068 --> 20:07.068
But once we're running
as a nonprofit,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.137
one donation will be

20:09.275 --> 20:10.862
indistinguishable from another.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.827
Whether legitimate
or more "creative."

20:13.965 --> 20:17.172
And what will our
nonprofit peddle?

20:17.310 --> 20:19.172
Something useful
to the community.

20:19.310 --> 20:22.655
Think of it as a carbon offset.

20:22.793 --> 20:26.344
Reparations for the
darker elements of our business.

20:26.482 --> 20:29.103
Launder your guilt if you want,

20:29.241 --> 20:31.689
just make sure my money
gets clean, too.

20:39.965 --> 20:43.310
Looks like your charity
has already begun.

21:04.655 --> 21:05.931
We bring you an offering.

21:06.068 --> 21:09.137
I hope there are 40,000 kilos
of heroin in there.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.689
I understand your frustration,

21:11.827 --> 21:13.758
but whoever burned down
your warehouse

21:13.896 --> 21:15.896
stole just as much
from the Mayans.

21:16.034 --> 21:18.931
We banked our entire future
on being in business with you.

21:19.068 --> 21:22.068
Our business resulted
in the Mayans

21:22.206 --> 21:24.172
murdering my accountant,

21:24.310 --> 21:27.551
and then, within days,
a substantial portion

21:27.689 --> 21:31.000
of our supply went up in flame.

21:31.137 --> 21:32.896
That is two strikes.

21:34.206 --> 21:35.689
I promise you,

21:35.827 --> 21:38.965
you will not survive a third.

21:39.103 --> 21:40.827
My hope

21:40.965 --> 21:43.655
is that, with this offering,
we can repair our relationship.

22:31.793 --> 22:33.965
You said you had
something of value.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.655
- We gave you an arsenal.
- From the Cold War.

22:36.793 --> 22:39.517
I did you a favor,
and you've embarrassed me.

22:39.655 --> 22:41.172
Fuck your embarrassment.

22:41.310 --> 22:43.793
Who's running
your heroin pipeline?

22:45.793 --> 22:49.000
Times are changing, Ezekiel.

22:53.862 --> 22:56.000
And you're getting left behind.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.344
The fuck was that?

23:09.482 --> 23:11.172
Fuck that motherfucker.

23:11.310 --> 23:13.413
You see what that dude
was carrying?

23:13.551 --> 23:15.068
Some high-speed shit.

23:15.206 --> 23:17.862
The military just ordered those
to replace the M4.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.413
Takes a particular motherfucker
to get their hands on that.

23:20.551 --> 23:23.103
No wonder they don't want
what we got.

23:23.241 --> 23:24.793
Where the fuck
are they getting those?

23:24.931 --> 23:27.413
Maybe the same person who's
supplying the heroin pipeline.

23:27.551 --> 23:29.034
What do we do?

23:29.172 --> 23:30.793
We fucking find them.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.000
What do we do about all these?

23:34.965 --> 23:36.275
Put them back on the truck.

23:36.413 --> 23:38.620
Fuck.

23:54.206 --> 23:55.689
So, uh...

23:55.827 --> 23:57.413
did he give you any problems?

23:57.551 --> 23:59.758
- Yeah.
- Nah.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.551
It was cake.

24:03.517 --> 24:05.931
Here's your, uh, cut
from our last score.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.344
- This is it?
- Yeah, that's 20%.

24:08.482 --> 24:09.344
That was our deal.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.758
Fuck that!
We need real money, now.

24:11.896 --> 24:13.551
Hey, 300 bucks is nothing
to sneeze at, all right?

24:13.689 --> 24:14.931
We need 13,000.

24:15.068 --> 24:17.620
- Dollars?
- In the next week.

24:19.655 --> 24:21.586
They're gonna kick us
out of our house

24:21.724 --> 24:24.000
if we don't come up with it
by next Friday.

24:28.172 --> 24:29.758
I got it.

24:29.896 --> 24:31.344
I'll get the video business
back up and running.

24:31.482 --> 24:34.000
I'll book you
on some shoots and...

24:36.310 --> 24:38.862
All right, all right.
I was just trying to help.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.413
Help by getting us
one big score.

24:41.551 --> 24:43.172
Look at you,
all gangster all of a sudden.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.413
"One big score." Come on, relax.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.793
Fuck it. Fuck it.

24:47.931 --> 24:49.517
Let's just go back
to all the people we've jacked

24:49.655 --> 24:51.206
and let them know that this
fool's the one who set them up

24:51.344 --> 24:52.862
to take out his competition.

24:54.206 --> 24:55.896
I bet we could crowdsource
at least 13 grand

24:56.034 --> 24:57.137
for that information.

24:57.275 --> 24:58.689
Come on, Letty. We're friends.

25:00.206 --> 25:01.241
We're acquaintances.

25:01.379 --> 25:03.344
At best.

25:04.793 --> 25:06.655
That's cold.

25:09.689 --> 25:13.241
All right. There is one thing.

25:13.379 --> 25:14.620
We're in.

25:14.758 --> 25:16.034
It's hella dangerous, though.

25:16.172 --> 25:18.689
- We won't do it.
- Yes, we will.

25:18.827 --> 25:21.379
I don't care what it is.
We're doing it.

25:21.517 --> 25:23.172
All right.

25:25.965 --> 25:27.793
I'll make some calls.

25:48.655 --> 25:50.379
- ...and actually do something.
- We got to say something.

25:50.517 --> 25:52.620
Do something.
You have a VP patch

25:52.758 --> 25:54.689
on your fucking kutte
and you do nothing.

26:14.275 --> 26:15.517
What?

26:18.655 --> 26:20.689
They hit our transport.

26:20.827 --> 26:23.586
Stole what was gonna
not only feed our coffers,

26:23.724 --> 26:26.551
but also keep
all of California armed.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.241
We lost three brothers.
Good men.

26:33.827 --> 26:35.000
Hmm.

26:38.448 --> 26:40.310
And the others?

26:51.965 --> 26:53.965
Uh...

26:54.103 --> 26:56.103
How many brothers

26:56.241 --> 26:58.827
were part of the transport?

27:04.103 --> 27:05.275
Anyone?

27:05.413 --> 27:06.448
Five others.

27:06.586 --> 27:08.758
Thank you, Joker.

27:08.896 --> 27:10.931
- And where are they?
- They're fucking...

27:11.068 --> 27:13.655
...lucky to be alive, man.

27:13.793 --> 27:15.965
Hmm.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.172
That doesn't sound like luck.

27:26.137 --> 27:27.344
Sounds like...

27:29.344 --> 27:32.034
...a lot of effort on their part

27:32.172 --> 27:35.379
went into still being...

27:37.379 --> 27:38.862
...alive.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.034
- They did what they had...
- No!

27:43.000 --> 27:46.931
They were almost free, man.

27:51.034 --> 27:53.344
Only the dead

27:53.482 --> 27:55.482
have seen the end of war.

27:58.275 --> 27:59.551
And now...

28:01.482 --> 28:03.896
...their suffering continues.

28:07.379 --> 28:09.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:19.379 --> 28:21.000
Come on, man.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.862
Stop pouting.

28:25.862 --> 28:29.379
Hey. Our enemy have
finally shown some life.

28:29.517 --> 28:31.482
All the winning,

28:31.620 --> 28:35.379
it was, you know...

28:37.379 --> 28:40.896
It was starting to get boring,
but this--

28:41.034 --> 28:45.310
this... this is exciting.

28:47.275 --> 28:49.068
Tonight we celebrate.

28:50.310 --> 28:53.758
No, I said Big Boss,
hold the Foster's sauce!

28:53.896 --> 28:55.344
Onion rings and Krispy Chicken.

28:55.482 --> 28:57.413
<i>Double... ex.. ...auce.</i>

28:57.551 --> 28:59.379
<i>- With cheese?</i>
- What?

28:59.517 --> 29:01.724
<i>Ex... ...auce, ...eese.</i>

29:01.862 --> 29:03.758
Big Boss. No sauce.

29:03.896 --> 29:05.551
<i>Okay.
Double... extra sauce,</i>

29:05.689 --> 29:07.034
<i>- with cheese.</i>
- Yo, what the fuck, man?

29:08.931 --> 29:10.965
And a hot fudge parfait.

29:14.344 --> 29:16.275
And a hot fudge parfait.

29:16.413 --> 29:17.896
<i>Hot fudge parfait.</i>

29:18.034 --> 29:20.724
Look, sorry I fucked up, man,
all right?

29:20.862 --> 29:23.137
I mean, Letty came to me
and she said

29:23.275 --> 29:24.827
she was in a bad way and
she forced me to hook her up

29:24.965 --> 29:28.275
- with some money, and...
- What the fuck are you
talking about?

29:28.413 --> 29:30.551
What are <i>you</i> talking about?

29:30.689 --> 29:33.448
We want to know who's moving
product through the valley.

29:33.586 --> 29:36.068
Oh.
Oh, yeah, nah.

29:36.206 --> 29:38.517
Like...

29:38.655 --> 29:40.344
It's all pills, man.
That's what's hot right now.

29:40.482 --> 29:42.724
We don't care
about your pill bullshit.

29:42.862 --> 29:45.379
Nah, man. For reals, I'm telling
you, pills it's where it's at.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.241
Fuck your small-time shit.
Who's running chiva?

29:48.379 --> 29:50.379
Heroin?

29:51.827 --> 29:53.689
There's a crew
out in the Salton Sea.

29:53.827 --> 29:55.620
But they, uh,
they stay off the grid, man.

29:55.758 --> 29:57.931
I hear they dabble in dope.

30:01.413 --> 30:03.034
Who?

30:03.172 --> 30:06.275
Broken Saints MC or some shit.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.586
I...
I never dealt with them.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.275
It's just rumors you hear.

30:10.413 --> 30:12.241
Bunch of ghosts in the desert.

30:13.344 --> 30:15.586
Never heard of 'em.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.103
Hey, uh,

30:20.241 --> 30:21.620
am I good to go or...

30:28.827 --> 30:30.965
Aw, come on, fellas, really?
You didn't leave me anything?

30:31.103 --> 30:32.689
Hey...

30:35.448 --> 30:37.379
Really?

30:39.862 --> 30:42.068
We're gonna ride out
to the Salton Sea.

30:42.206 --> 30:44.275
You go see Creeper.

30:44.413 --> 30:47.448
See if he's heard anything about
this crew moving dope inside.

30:47.586 --> 30:50.103
Copy that.

30:50.241 --> 30:52.689
And you tell him to hold on.

30:52.827 --> 30:54.172
We got his back.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.689
We'll figure this out,
get back on top. I promise.

30:58.482 --> 31:00.172
I'll let him know.

32:29.344 --> 32:31.206
Hey, little buddy.

32:31.344 --> 32:32.758
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey.

32:32.896 --> 32:34.965
You shoot that fucking dog,
I'm fucking shooting you.

32:35.103 --> 32:37.172
Come here.
Hey, baby. Hi.

32:37.310 --> 32:38.379
Hey.

32:38.517 --> 32:40.448
Who's a handsome boy?

32:40.586 --> 32:42.068
Hey.

32:42.206 --> 32:43.896
Fucking dogs.

32:44.034 --> 32:45.896
Aah! Ow! Aah!

32:47.172 --> 32:48.896
Aah!

32:50.137 --> 32:51.793
- Get off of me!
- Aah!

33:09.103 --> 33:11.862
Oh, my fucking God.

33:33.793 --> 33:35.482
You're trespassing.

33:40.724 --> 33:43.586
We shoot trespassers.

34:02.758 --> 34:05.068
- We come in peace.
- You'll leave in pieces, motherfucker,

34:05.206 --> 34:07.655
if you don't drop
that condescending attitude.

34:11.862 --> 34:13.344
You have to forgive us.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.551
You're not exactly
what we were expecting.

34:17.551 --> 34:18.896
But looks like
you were expecting someone.

34:19.034 --> 34:20.896
You with them?

34:21.034 --> 34:22.689
- Who?
- Iron War.

34:22.827 --> 34:26.068
- The LEO club?
- Fuck Iron War.

34:26.206 --> 34:28.413
Bunch of cops and COs
playing one-percenter.

34:28.551 --> 34:31.137
Seems like everyone wants
to be one-percenter these days.

34:31.275 --> 34:32.965
You think we're aping <i>you,</i>
motherfucker?

34:33.103 --> 34:35.827
Mayans, Sons.

34:35.965 --> 34:37.344
You're fucking Walmart.

34:37.482 --> 34:41.310
Limp-dick corporate shills
working out your mommy issues.

34:41.448 --> 34:42.793
Hot.

34:44.965 --> 34:46.379
Hey.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.896
We mean no disrespect.

34:53.034 --> 34:55.827
Wondering if maybe you and I
can have a conversation,

34:55.965 --> 34:58.000
in private?

34:59.724 --> 35:02.724
If it's not too much trouble,

35:02.862 --> 35:06.068
maybe she could let my man go.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.862
Hot.

35:26.413 --> 35:28.655
We are not who
you're looking for.

35:30.517 --> 35:32.931
What we do...

35:33.068 --> 35:35.689
- is rescuing, um...
- What, dogs and horses?

35:40.137 --> 35:42.000
And people.

35:44.103 --> 35:46.689
And, yeah, we sling a little.

35:47.931 --> 35:49.793
Feed's expensive.

35:53.482 --> 35:54.965
And if humans want
to numb themselves

35:55.103 --> 35:57.379
to their own sickness...

35:57.517 --> 35:58.896
we'll use that money to undo

35:59.034 --> 36:00.620
some of the damage
they've caused.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.172
You got to do some bad
to do some good sometimes.

36:06.896 --> 36:08.724
What'd Iron War want from you?

36:08.862 --> 36:10.689
A piece.

36:12.344 --> 36:13.620
They say they control
everything now

36:13.758 --> 36:15.758
within a hundred miles
of the border.

36:18.862 --> 36:21.103
See, you and the Sons,

36:21.241 --> 36:24.310
you're so busy measuring dicks
and murdering each other,

36:24.448 --> 36:27.517
you don't realize how badly
you've fucked up the ecosystem.

36:29.517 --> 36:32.517
Invasive species out there
now trying to fill that void.

36:35.034 --> 36:38.448
None of my business, but you
paying taxes now to Iron War?

36:43.275 --> 36:44.965
It's none of your business.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.620
But fuck no.

36:48.344 --> 36:50.344
They came around here.

36:52.896 --> 36:57.137
Sister Anne made sure
they left grinning.

37:06.827 --> 37:08.482
They'll be back, you know.

37:15.413 --> 37:16.862
I know.

37:22.103 --> 37:24.862
And if someone really wanted
to do you some damage,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.827
some dogs and old rifles
aren't gonna be enough.

37:27.965 --> 37:30.000
Think I don't know that?

37:41.137 --> 37:43.206
Listen, if you ever need help...

37:43.344 --> 37:44.862
Oh.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.896
Are you our white knight?

37:47.034 --> 37:49.206
You're gonna come in here
and save us?

37:56.172 --> 37:57.862
Get the fuck off our property
before you all end up

37:58.000 --> 38:00.068
dead and buried in a ditch.

38:18.517 --> 38:20.862
Keep him still.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.793
Pops. Man...
Use my phone.

38:23.931 --> 38:25.896
I only trust things
that do one thing.

38:26.034 --> 38:29.241
They either take a picture
or they make a phone call.

38:29.379 --> 38:31.827
The hell is he talking about?

38:35.931 --> 38:37.931
- You need to be in it.
- Ah.

38:42.482 --> 38:45.586
All the Reyes men together.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.896
No, no, no, no.
We need the mama,

38:48.034 --> 38:49.724
the huntress, too.

38:52.172 --> 38:54.206
There has to be a timer.

38:54.344 --> 38:56.275
Here?

38:56.413 --> 38:58.379
Okay. You guys ready?

39:00.310 --> 39:02.275
Okay. Ready?

39:02.413 --> 39:03.586
Wait, wait, don't-don't
hold him by the armpits.

39:03.724 --> 39:04.827
Here, give him to me.

39:04.965 --> 39:08.000
He likes to be supported
by the bottom.

39:09.275 --> 39:10.517
I think we're ready.

39:12.034 --> 39:13.241
Oh.

39:28.689 --> 39:31.206
Sleeping?

39:31.344 --> 39:33.724
You need to be more careful.

39:35.655 --> 39:36.896
No.

39:38.896 --> 39:41.310
You need to tell Angel
the truth.

39:44.172 --> 39:47.724
Secrets destroy anything good.

39:47.862 --> 39:49.896
Trust me.

40:01.724 --> 40:03.758
It won't be much longer.

40:18.275 --> 40:20.275
What do you do over there?

40:46.482 --> 40:47.965
Sit down.

He's been using it

42:48.172 --> 42:52.379
EZ didn't start using utensils
till he was over a year.

42:53.448 --> 42:55.586
- When did I?
- If I'm not mistaken,

42:55.724 --> 42:58.517
Luisa was cutting up your meat

42:58.655 --> 43:00.413

Hey. You good?

45:45.620 --> 45:48.172
You got this, baby.

45:48.310 --> 45:50.000
The club.

45:50.137 --> 45:52.379
All of it. You got this.

45:56.896 --> 46:00.206
I don't know.

46:02.620 --> 46:04.103
I just...

46:09.344 --> 46:11.344
Stay down.

46:28.655 --> 46:30.137
The fuck?

46:31.655 --> 46:33.689
Whose car is this?

46:33.827 --> 46:35.275
Adelita's.

46:36.344 --> 46:37.793
She's back?

46:39.344 --> 46:40.793
When?

46:43.517 --> 46:45.068
Hi. Hi.

46:45.206 --> 46:46.586
You're getting out of there.
You're getting out.

46:46.724 --> 46:50.413
- Dada.
- I know, I know.

47:00.448 --> 47:02.448
You're an uncle.

47:15.862 --> 47:18.758
Hey. Hey.

47:18.896 --> 47:20.689
Happy birthday.

47:20.827 --> 47:23.413
What's his name?

47:23.551 --> 47:25.413
- Maverick.
- Bullshit.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.724
Yeah?

47:27.862 --> 47:29.793
Maverick?

47:29.931 --> 47:32.172
She let you name him that?

47:32.310 --> 47:34.965
It was her idea. Kind of.

47:41.517 --> 47:43.896
- Yo, this war...
- No, no.

47:46.172 --> 47:47.724
I can't handle
you losing faith, too.

47:47.862 --> 47:50.103
I ain't losing faith.

47:50.241 --> 47:52.862
I just wanted you
to meet your nephew.

47:55.620 --> 47:58.206
To know that we got family now

47:58.344 --> 48:00.068
to live for.

We ain't nothing without family.

48:12.655 --> 48:14.000
Hi.

48:44.034 --> 48:45.275
Hey.

48:51.551 --> 48:53.413
You leaving?

48:57.517 --> 48:59.413
Got someplace I got to be.

49:00.379 --> 49:02.034
Yeah.

49:02.172 --> 49:04.034
Me too.

49:04.172 --> 49:05.689
Got a bunch of glasses to clean,

49:05.827 --> 49:08.724
bunch of rude dicks
asking for drinks.

49:12.517 --> 49:14.344
Better get to it, then.

49:18.379 --> 49:19.896
Yeah.

49:20.931 --> 49:23.000
I better.

49:27.551 --> 49:29.000
Hey.

49:32.068 --> 49:34.482

52:25.620 --> 52:27.689
But you have to respect it.

52:31.517 --> 52:34.034
Good night, Obispo.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Five minute warning!

54:05.689 --> 54:08.758
I couldn't get it out.

54:08.896 --> 54:11.551
What the fuck
are you talking about?

54:11.689 --> 54:13.413
I couldn't...

54:13.551 --> 54:15.551
I couldn't get it out.

54:20.931 --> 54:24.137
You need to get it the fuck out.

54:53.793 --> 54:56.482
I got it.

55:00.413 --> 55:02.068
Okay, folks, that's it.

55:02.206 --> 55:04.034
Tonight's visiting hours
are over.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.758
Let's go. Visitors to the left.

55:12.896 --> 55:15.206
Convicts on the red line.

55:21.551 --> 55:24.172
Prisoners, move out!

55:26.034 --> 55:27.724
Step out, along the gate.

55:30.206 --> 55:33.000
Up next, eyes on the deck.
Line 'em up.

55:37.379 --> 55:39.068
Fucking Hank say?

55:39.206 --> 55:42.241
We hit them other fools hard.
Took down a shipment.

55:42.379 --> 55:45.137
- Could be crippled.
- Fuck the war.

55:45.275 --> 55:47.862
- What did they say about us?
- Wall!

55:49.827 --> 55:53.000
What are they doing for us?

55:53.137 --> 55:54.482
- They're tracking
something down...
- Vargas,

55:54.620 --> 55:56.068
you got something to say
to your boyfriend,

55:56.206 --> 55:58.896
you can hold onto his pocket
when I do your cavity search.

56:01.068 --> 56:02.310
Move out.

56:04.275 --> 56:06.034
Fucking all alone in here.

56:06.172 --> 56:07.827
If they don't start
looking out for us,

56:07.965 --> 56:09.827
we're gonna have to start
looking out for ourselves.

56:09.965 --> 56:12.793
Man, EZ's got a plan.
He's gonna take care of it.

56:12.931 --> 56:15.862
Fuck EZ.
Fuck all those motherfuckers.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.551
Leaving us out here to dry.

56:17.689 --> 56:19.275
Wall!

56:28.137 --> 56:29.862
Relax, is all I'm saying.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.413
Tell that Mayan rat
Smokey says hello.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.413
- Oh, shit, man.
- Hey, man, let's go!

56:45.206 --> 56:48.068
