00:00.240 --> 00:01.625
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.678 --> 00:02.977
We spoke to Jude's therapist.

00:03.013 --> 00:04.246
- Why isn't he talking?
- They think it's something

00:04.281 --> 00:06.015
called selective mutism.

00:06.099 --> 00:07.499
- It's a coping mechanism.
- What are we supposed to do then?

00:07.534 --> 00:10.336
- I'm not gonna make a big deal about...
- Hey, buddy.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.171
- You told Emma about Hayley?
- Yes.

00:12.205 --> 00:14.273
Why would you tell Hayley you
were a couple and not tell Emma?

00:14.307 --> 00:15.274
That's none of your business.

00:15.308 --> 00:16.308
This is about you trying to be

00:16.343 --> 00:17.343
like all those other girls.

00:17.427 --> 00:19.395
- Are you OK?
- Not really, no.

00:19.429 --> 00:21.530
I ate a pot brownie and I am freaking out.

00:21.564 --> 00:23.555
It's OK, you made a mistake.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.610
And tomorrow everything
is gonna be back to normal.

00:25.611 --> 00:27.336
No, things will never be normal again.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.607
I slept with Dani.

00:28.641 --> 00:30.542
Dani?

00:30.577 --> 00:32.511
I was gonna have sex with Wyatt today.

00:32.545 --> 00:34.313
I kinda freaked out. All of the sudden,

00:34.347 --> 00:38.383
I couldn't breathe and I just
felt like he was gonna crush me.

00:38.418 --> 00:40.486
- Maybe you were just nervous.
- Or maybe

00:40.520 --> 00:42.387
I'm still in love with Brandon.

00:42.422 --> 00:44.490
- I thought you were over him.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

00:44.524 --> 00:46.191
- Don't give up on Wyatt.
- I'm not.

00:46.226 --> 00:47.559
- That was Liam.
- The foster brother

00:47.627 --> 00:49.294
- you told me about?
- He forced me to have sex with him.

00:49.329 --> 00:51.363
That's not cool, Callie.
You know that, right?

00:51.397 --> 00:52.664
That what he did wasn't cool.

01:20.326 --> 01:22.161
Did we overdo it with the pink?

01:23.530 --> 01:26.431
Maybe we shoulda gone more gender neutral.

01:26.466 --> 01:31.236
You know, less sugar and
spice and everything nice.

01:31.271 --> 01:34.540
Hm. No daughter of ours is
gonna be everything nice.

01:36.309 --> 01:38.610
Speaking of naughty, kids are still asleep.

01:47.487 --> 01:50.422
Mmm. Not all the kids.

01:57.664 --> 02:01.600
Oh, honey, Mama's here.

02:01.634 --> 02:03.468
Mama's here.

02:03.503 --> 02:07.239
Yeah. I think she's hungry.

02:07.273 --> 02:08.539
She's always hungry.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.477
Come here, baby.

02:12.512 --> 02:14.146
Hi.

02:15.448 --> 02:19.218
You know, she has your lovely long fingers.

02:19.252 --> 02:23.155
And your perfect little Flintstone toes.

02:26.659 --> 02:28.293
Hi.

03:34.627 --> 03:36.628
What's with all the yelling
and the door slamming?

03:39.565 --> 03:41.533
- What friends?
- Hayley.

03:41.567 --> 03:44.569
- You're dating Hayley?
- No, no. They're having sex.

03:45.538 --> 03:47.172
See? Shut up!

03:47.206 --> 03:48.473
Don't tell your sister to shut up.

03:48.508 --> 03:51.209
- Thank you.
- And you, shut up about your brother's business!

03:51.244 --> 03:52.544
What happened with Emma?

03:52.578 --> 03:53.784
We broke up.

03:53.785 --> 03:55.915
But now, Emma wants to get back together

03:56.215 --> 03:58.650
and he didn't wanna tell her about
Hayley so he can, like, string her along

03:58.685 --> 04:00.385
or something, so I told her.

04:00.420 --> 04:02.554
- Are you using condoms?
- Mom.

04:02.588 --> 04:05.324
- Are you?
- Yes, of course.

04:05.358 --> 04:07.492
- Gross.
- Says the virgin.

04:07.527 --> 04:11.530
OK, enough! No more door slamming.

04:11.564 --> 04:13.131
- Mom.
- Are you OK?

04:14.467 --> 04:17.235
I'm fine. Just got up a little too fast.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.172
Do your homework.

04:24.177 --> 04:26.445
Hi, Dr. Hillcroft, it's Lena Adams-Foster.

04:26.479 --> 04:29.548
I'm sorry to call you on your cell but

04:29.582 --> 04:33.418
I just had a headache all
day that I can't shake.

04:33.453 --> 04:36.455
and I was wondering if there
was anything I could take?

04:36.489 --> 04:39.491
So could you call me,
please, on my cell or text me?

04:39.525 --> 04:41.226
Thanks.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.200
Hey, babe.

04:48.234 --> 04:49.601
Hey, where are you?

04:49.635 --> 04:52.237
Well, I was just getting ready
to leave here. Is everything OK?

04:53.339 --> 04:54.506
Yeah, yeah.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.542
- Hurry home.
- I will.

04:59.579 --> 05:01.246
So how long's this been going on?

05:01.280 --> 05:02.514
Don't make it sound like
we're having an affair.

05:02.548 --> 05:05.117
Well, something secret is going on here.

05:05.151 --> 05:08.220
OK, look, I went to the halfway house

05:08.254 --> 05:10.522
- the night I slipped, OK?
- Yeah, I know. A witness saw you.

05:10.556 --> 05:12.290
What do you mean a witness saw me?

05:12.325 --> 05:14.192
I showed him your picture
and he identified you.

05:14.227 --> 05:16.395
- You're investigating me?!
- Because you were lying.

05:16.429 --> 05:19.131
- And you thought what, Stef?
- You had been drinking...

05:19.165 --> 05:20.298
- What, that I killed her?
- ... and you had blood on your hands.

05:20.333 --> 05:23.168
He's been helping me.

05:23.202 --> 05:25.470
I've been sober for 60 days now.

05:25.505 --> 05:27.472
It's the longest since I was 15.

05:27.507 --> 05:29.541
So you were doing drugs while
you were pregnant with the twins?

05:29.575 --> 05:32.511
- That's a low blow.
- Why don't we take this outside.

05:32.545 --> 05:34.546
Please.

05:40.293 --> 05:43.395
So, what, Mike? You're
her "sponsor"? Is that it?

05:43.429 --> 05:45.497
You really think I'm capable of murder?

05:45.531 --> 05:47.466
Don't turn this around on me.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.334
Do you know how many
nights I have laid awake...

05:49.368 --> 05:50.469
I knew you wouldn't approve...

05:50.503 --> 05:52.537
I don't approve.

05:52.572 --> 05:57.375
That woman has lied, and threatened,
and manipulated my family.

05:57.410 --> 06:02.247
She almost landed you in jail. She
used our son to try and extort us, Mike.

06:02.281 --> 06:05.417
Yes. She's done horrible
things, because she's sick.

06:05.451 --> 06:08.220
I don't expect you to
understand, you're not an addict.

06:08.254 --> 06:10.455
But she's not a terrible person.

06:10.490 --> 06:12.557
Who's paying for this?

06:12.592 --> 06:15.460
I am but just until she can get a job...

06:15.495 --> 06:18.396
I can't believe how foolish you're being.

06:18.431 --> 06:20.365
You could be charged
with witness tampering...

06:20.399 --> 06:22.167
She's not gonna go to the DA.

06:23.236 --> 06:24.336
I want no part of this.

06:24.370 --> 06:27.339
Good. Then stop following me
and mind your own business.

06:30.243 --> 06:31.543
Hey, baby, what's going on?

06:31.577 --> 06:33.445
Brandon just took Mama
to the emergency room.

06:33.479 --> 06:36.581
- What? Why?
- She fainted and she was throwing up.

06:36.616 --> 06:38.517
- What ER?
- Sacred Cross.

06:38.551 --> 06:39.651
I'm on my way.

06:48.598 --> 06:51.400
- 140 over 90.
- Which is good.

06:51.435 --> 06:55.638
- It hasn't risen.
- It hasn't gone down either.

06:55.672 --> 06:57.406
OK.

06:57.441 --> 06:59.375
Eight glasses a day, please.

06:59.409 --> 07:00.476
Are you sure you don't
want me to call your mother?

07:00.510 --> 07:02.478
No. I'm supposed to avoid stress,

07:02.512 --> 07:03.546
not invite it for the weekend.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.448
Maybe I should call the doctor.

07:05.482 --> 07:08.417
Mm. No. Don't be the boy
who cried wolf, please.

07:08.452 --> 07:09.585
If the medication isn't working...

07:09.619 --> 07:11.620
As long as it doesn't go any higher,

07:11.655 --> 07:13.589
the doctor said there's
nothing to worry about.

07:13.623 --> 07:15.458
Well, I wouldn't say nothing.

07:16.693 --> 07:18.527
- Am I driving you crazy?
- A little bit.

07:18.562 --> 07:21.530
- OK.
- Honey, I love you for taking such good care of me

07:21.565 --> 07:23.666
but you gotta get out of the house.

07:23.700 --> 07:29.305
Go for a run. Go run an errand. Go
get me a veggie burger from Viv's.

07:29.339 --> 07:32.575
OK, all right. If you
need anything use this.

07:32.609 --> 07:33.676
Oh!

07:33.710 --> 07:36.545
- I got it from the earthquake kit.
- Seriously?

07:36.580 --> 07:38.581
I don't want you having to yell for us.

07:42.352 --> 07:44.453
I... don't know what's going on with her.

07:44.488 --> 07:48.424
Things were really good and then
she, like, suddenly pulled away.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.494
And she's not talking to me, really.

07:51.528 --> 07:54.363
She just keeps saying everything's
fine but I know it's not.

07:54.397 --> 07:56.665
I'm not really sure what to say.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.301
Is she still hung up on you?
I mean... are you guys... ?

07:59.336 --> 08:02.404
- We're brother and sister.
- Not yet.

08:02.439 --> 08:05.508
Look, we're not friends.

08:05.542 --> 08:08.377
And I can't be your couples counselor.

08:08.411 --> 08:10.479
- That's not what I'm asking.
- What are you asking?

08:10.514 --> 08:13.682
- For a little help?
- I already helped.

08:13.717 --> 08:15.518
I got out of your way.

08:15.552 --> 08:21.323
Look, nobody gave me a guide
to understanding Callie. OK?

08:21.358 --> 08:23.592
If that's even possible.

08:23.627 --> 08:24.660
So...

08:26.663 --> 08:29.698
I don't know, maybe you
need to give her some space.

08:30.634 --> 08:32.501
That's all I got.

08:36.405 --> 08:38.274
Thanks for the advice.

08:44.447 --> 08:47.583
Hi, I'm Brian. These are my parents.

08:47.617 --> 08:52.354
We're here to see the bed.

08:52.389 --> 08:54.356
I got this. I'm Jesus.

08:54.391 --> 08:57.593
- Hey, I'm selling mom's bed.
- The one she's lying in right now?

08:57.627 --> 08:59.495
- You can't.
- They asked me to.

08:59.529 --> 09:02.264
- What's in it for you?
- Ten percent.

09:02.299 --> 09:05.234
Mom, I forgot I had people
coming to see the bed today.

09:05.268 --> 09:08.404
- Should you be up?
- I'm supposed to stretch my legs.

09:08.438 --> 09:10.639
And, yeah, it's fine to show the bed.

09:10.674 --> 09:12.641
Well, why does he get to sell the bed?

09:12.676 --> 09:15.344
Why don't you two just work together.

09:15.378 --> 09:17.513
This girl couldn't sell
a dollar for fifty cents.

09:17.547 --> 09:20.349
Uh, the 1950's called,
they want their joke back.

09:20.383 --> 09:22.685
So is now a good time?

09:30.627 --> 09:32.561
My mom was wondering how
long you've had the bed.

09:32.596 --> 09:34.630
Less than six months, it's practically new.

09:34.664 --> 09:36.699
It has a 20 year transferable warranty.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.601
And it's retailed at $6,000.

09:38.635 --> 09:40.736
For 2,500, this is a steal.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.474
Are you clean?

09:45.508 --> 09:46.642
Like, hygienic?

09:46.676 --> 09:48.677
My moms shower before bed every night.

10:00.757 --> 10:03.325
My mom wants to know if you have a husband?

10:03.360 --> 10:07.596
Yes, but he's not home
right now. He's working.

10:07.631 --> 10:12.568
I have a wife and the bed was a
wedding gift but it doesn't suit us.

10:12.602 --> 10:14.570
They're lesbians.

10:14.604 --> 10:15.604
Is that a problem?

10:37.560 --> 10:39.328
It's not a problem.

10:39.362 --> 10:40.429
Great.

10:44.701 --> 10:48.370
Why don't we let the Kims discuss
this privately for a few minutes?

10:48.405 --> 10:50.406
- Thank you.
- I just want to let you know

10:50.440 --> 10:51.733
there's a lot of interest in this bed.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.292
You're the first people to see it today.

10:53.510 --> 10:55.611
So I'd act fast.

11:09.392 --> 11:11.727
Hey, you wanna help?

11:15.365 --> 11:18.367
Thought I'd do some planting for Lena.

11:18.401 --> 11:22.705
She's been so busy at school
and now with the baby...

11:24.674 --> 11:29.378
Everything's gonna be fine, it's
just a drag, to be on bed rest.

11:32.382 --> 11:37.586
Just plant these ones in rows
about, like, six inches apart, OK?

11:44.627 --> 11:47.363
You know...

11:47.397 --> 11:48.797
you've always been so good.

11:48.832 --> 11:51.400
You always held it
together. You never lost it.

11:51.434 --> 11:54.503
No matter what bad stuff happened to us.

11:56.406 --> 11:58.374
You're due for a breakdown.

11:59.743 --> 12:03.412
So, don't let me

12:03.446 --> 12:06.348
or anyone else make you
feel like you have to talk.

12:07.584 --> 12:09.451
Until you're ready.

12:23.135 --> 12:26.838
OK, special delivery for the
sexiest pregnant woman in...

12:27.239 --> 12:30.908
- Hi.
- Uh, hello.

12:30.943 --> 12:34.879
I'm Brian. Those are my parents
and they're interested in the bed.

12:44.790 --> 12:48.759
Actually, my mom is interested
but my dad doesn't like it.

12:48.794 --> 12:52.997
Would you be willing to sell half the bed?

12:55.968 --> 12:58.035
In case you change your
mind about splitting the bed.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.804
If someone else wants half, we'll call you.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.076
- What?
- Way to close the deal.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.878
I'm not selling half a bed.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.046
I'm surprised you didn't
just string them along.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.882
Just in case you couldn't decide.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.984
Don't go there.

13:13.018 --> 13:17.922
And by the way, I'm still a virgin because
I want to be, not because I have to be.

13:17.956 --> 13:22.126
Mat. You know Jesus and my
sister, the virgin Mariana.

13:31.069 --> 13:33.104
139 over 80.

13:33.138 --> 13:35.039
See? The medication is working.

13:35.073 --> 13:36.140
Yeah, I didn't doubt it for a minute.

13:36.174 --> 13:37.174
Ha.

13:37.209 --> 13:39.744
But you still have to
stay right here and rest.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.879
Not letting anymore strangers
up here to see the bed today.

13:41.914 --> 13:44.148
I'm fine. And we have
to get rid of this thing.

13:44.216 --> 13:45.983
Especially before the baby comes.

13:46.018 --> 13:48.085
We don't want her falling into the crack.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.787
Oh, so we're co-sleeping, are we?

13:49.821 --> 13:52.790
I kinda think it'd be nice, you know?

13:52.824 --> 13:54.258
I've been reading about
attachment parenting...

13:54.293 --> 13:57.194
Yeah, well, you know, people have been
known to roll over on their babies.

13:57.229 --> 13:59.864
We're not heavy drinkers or sleepers.

13:59.898 --> 14:01.899
I'm just saying, it's not recommended.

14:01.934 --> 14:05.036
Can you imagine coming out of
the comfort and warmth of the womb

14:05.070 --> 14:07.805
and then being left in a crib all alone.

14:07.839 --> 14:09.275
That's what a swaddle's for.

14:09.276 --> 14:11.693
Brandon slept in a crib and
he has turned out just fine.

14:13.011 --> 14:15.046
Hey, Mike and Dani are here.

14:16.114 --> 14:19.817
OK. Stay. Rest. You.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.757
So just heat on 350 for about 30 minutes.

14:26.792 --> 14:27.959
OK, thanks. I appreciate it.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.961
- All Dani's idea.
- Yeah?

14:29.995 --> 14:33.864
With Lena on bed rest, I
don't want you to have to cook.

14:33.899 --> 14:35.166
Is this like serious?

14:35.200 --> 14:38.002
Not if they get it under control,

14:38.036 --> 14:39.937
but she may be on bed rest for a while.

14:39.972 --> 14:42.807
- Is she up for visitors?
- Yeah, I think so.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.843
Hey.

14:45.877 --> 14:48.179
Hey. What're you doing here?

14:48.213 --> 14:51.048
Dani made us dinner.
Isn't that nice of her?

14:51.083 --> 14:53.818
- Yeah.
- We're just going up and say hi to Lena.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.221
Is that a good idea? I
mean, she barely knows Dani.

14:57.255 --> 14:59.757
- Brandon.
- No. He's right.

14:59.791 --> 15:02.994
- You should just go, Mike.
- You sure?

15:03.028 --> 15:05.696
Yeah. I have to make the salad anyway.

15:05.731 --> 15:08.733
OK. I'll be right back.

15:10.202 --> 15:11.802
Um, can I get a salad bowl?

15:11.837 --> 15:14.005
Yeah, Brandon, will you grab
her a salad bowl, please?

15:14.039 --> 15:15.773
Yep.

15:20.846 --> 15:22.947
Thanks.

15:26.985 --> 15:29.020
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:29.054 --> 15:33.824
- How you doing?
- Much better. Thank you.

15:33.859 --> 15:36.961
Good. I heard you're having a girl.

15:36.995 --> 15:40.765
- Yeah.
- I'm really happy for you. Both.

15:40.799 --> 15:42.033
That means a lot.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.002
You know, Dani and I are
talking about having a baby.

15:46.972 --> 15:50.107
- Really?
- Yeah, she's younger than me and wants kids.

15:50.142 --> 15:53.144
And I don't know, I wouldn't
mind getting another chance.

15:53.178 --> 15:56.981
You know. Maybe do a
better job of it this time.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.716
Mike, you're a really good father.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.153
- I made a lot of mistakes.
- Everybody makes mistakes.

16:03.922 --> 16:07.892
Brandon, um, he loves you very much.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.961
He's made mistakes too.

16:12.064 --> 16:14.732
But he's back on the right track now.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.900
Right?

16:15.934 --> 16:18.703
I should let you rest.

16:18.737 --> 16:22.840
Dani just wanted to drop off
her special lasagna for you guys.

16:26.144 --> 16:28.913
- Mike.
- Yeah?

16:28.947 --> 16:32.783
Uh... Thank you.

16:32.818 --> 16:34.051
Thank Dani, she did all the cooking.

16:34.086 --> 16:36.787
Please, thank her for me.

16:36.822 --> 16:38.789
I will.

16:38.824 --> 16:40.791
Hi.

16:47.165 --> 16:49.900
Your dad is talking about
having a baby with Dani.

16:58.130 --> 16:59.770
I need you to know why I'm helping Ana.

16:59.771 --> 17:02.462
- I know why.
- No, you don't.

17:02.496 --> 17:06.366
I went to the halfway
house twice that night.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.234
First, to threaten Ana.

17:09.270 --> 17:12.438
And then, after I drank again...

17:13.674 --> 17:17.310
... I went back, to shut her up.

17:17.344 --> 17:18.278
For good.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.582
Yelling at her didn't
make me feel any better.

17:22.616 --> 17:25.550
She still had all the power to
destroy my career, maybe yours.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.688
But worst of all, to hurt our son.

17:30.391 --> 17:31.591
I was disgusted with myself.

17:31.625 --> 17:35.228
At least Brandon did something
to try to make her go away.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.598
To protect our family.
What was I doing? Nothing.

17:38.632 --> 17:43.236
So I went back. I parked outside.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.371
With a bottle and I waited.

17:45.406 --> 17:48.508
And the next thing I remember
was Dani found me passed out

17:48.542 --> 17:52.345
in my car in some parking lot
somewhere with blood on my hands.

17:52.379 --> 17:55.315
- Mike...
- Then...

17:55.349 --> 17:59.285
when I found out Ana
went missing that night...

17:59.320 --> 18:02.555
I had to find out what happened,

18:02.589 --> 18:05.291
even if it meant I'd
done something terrible.

18:05.326 --> 18:09.495
Thank God, I found her alive,
strung out in some crack house.

18:09.530 --> 18:13.399
I was so relieved, that I
vowed to myself and to God

18:13.434 --> 18:14.567
that I would do anything
I could to help her.

18:14.601 --> 18:17.503
To get her on her feet and get sober.

18:17.538 --> 18:21.441
Because in my heart, I did
want to kill her that night.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.479
And that's a sin I need
to make amends for, Stef.

18:28.248 --> 18:30.450
And knowing that alcohol
put me in that state of mind

18:30.484 --> 18:33.252
is why I'll never have
another drink ever again.

18:33.287 --> 18:35.621
Hey, all done?

18:35.656 --> 18:38.558
- Yep. Salad's in the fridge.
- Thank you.

18:38.592 --> 18:40.360
Hey, let us know if you need anything else.

18:40.394 --> 18:41.527
Will do.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.705
- Hey.
- Oh. I didn't know you were still here.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.541
- What's that?
- Geometry.

18:55.576 --> 18:58.211
Are you like a mathlete or something?

18:58.245 --> 18:59.579
I'm on the dance team.

18:59.613 --> 19:01.447
Which makes you better than a mathlete?

19:01.482 --> 19:03.349
- No.
- Hey, why do you dye your hair?

19:03.384 --> 19:05.418
- None of your business.
- Don't move.

19:05.452 --> 19:09.222
- What?
- There's a chip on your shoulder.

19:09.256 --> 19:10.590
I do not have a chip on my shoulder.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.294
Are you a good dancer?

19:15.329 --> 19:18.297
I don't know. I mean, I'm OK.

19:18.332 --> 19:19.565
- I'm not the best.
- Why not?

19:19.600 --> 19:20.633
- I'm just...
- Lazy?

19:20.667 --> 19:23.269
I work harder than
anyone on that dance team.

19:23.303 --> 19:24.270
- See?
- What?

19:24.304 --> 19:25.605
The not a chip thing.

19:25.639 --> 19:27.340
OK, I really need to do my homework.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.441
Do you want to go out sometime?

19:30.711 --> 19:32.345
With you?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.480
- Yeah.
- Alone, with you?

19:34.515 --> 19:35.615
Are you afraid to be alone with me?

19:35.649 --> 19:37.617
No.

19:37.651 --> 19:39.685
So?

19:39.720 --> 19:41.387
Could you be more specific?

19:41.422 --> 19:42.388
Friday night?

19:44.758 --> 19:48.394
- OK.
- OK.

19:59.373 --> 20:03.309
Sir. Can I ask you what you're doing?

20:03.343 --> 20:07.447
Looking for signs of urine, semen, or blood

20:07.481 --> 20:10.249
not visible to the human eye.

20:11.351 --> 20:12.785
Hey. There are more
people here to see the bed.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.388
- Get them some water or something.
- No. I'm not your assistant.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.557
I can't leave all these
strangers alone in our house.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.492
- That's your problem.
- Look, I'll cut you in.

20:19.526 --> 20:21.627
Like, ten percent of my ten percent.

20:21.662 --> 20:23.362
Twenty-five dollars? Get real.

20:23.397 --> 20:24.697
- Twenty-five percent.
- Half.

20:24.731 --> 20:27.266
- No way.
- All right, have fun. Hope nobody steals anything.

20:27.301 --> 20:28.534
Fine, fine. Forty/sixty.

20:30.370 --> 20:31.337
Deal.

20:34.641 --> 20:35.741
Hello?

20:38.679 --> 20:40.413
How many amps is this motor?

20:44.485 --> 20:46.352
- Hello.
- Do you live here?

20:46.386 --> 20:48.521
- Uh, yeah.
- How much do you want for the kitchen table?

20:48.555 --> 20:50.523
Oh, hey. They're here to see the bed.

20:50.557 --> 20:51.657
It'll just be a few more minutes.

20:51.692 --> 20:53.493
Yeah, and the kitchen table's not for sale.

20:55.429 --> 20:57.363
Well, how much are you
willing to pay for it?

21:00.367 --> 21:02.268
What?

21:04.705 --> 21:07.673
You know that we haven't
talked about baby names.

21:09.743 --> 21:13.312
I was kinda thinking we could

21:13.347 --> 21:15.281
name her after your dad.

21:15.315 --> 21:20.286
Frank? That's a good way to scar
her for the rest of her life.

21:22.322 --> 21:27.627
Francesca, and we could call her Frankie.

21:29.596 --> 21:33.299
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.301
What do you think?

21:37.771 --> 21:39.605
I think I love it.

21:47.748 --> 21:50.349
So...

21:51.485 --> 21:53.753
There's something I need to tell you.

21:54.788 --> 21:56.322
What about?

21:57.791 --> 21:59.625
Brandon.

22:11.845 --> 22:12.945
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:12.979 --> 22:15.714
I was just working on a new song.

22:15.749 --> 22:17.883
Can you come sit please?

22:19.619 --> 22:20.886
Yeah.

22:30.697 --> 22:33.899
- Mama told me what happened.
- She did?

22:36.803 --> 22:40.606
Uh, what did she tell you?

22:40.640 --> 22:41.974
That you got high.

22:44.978 --> 22:47.846
You did the right thing, calling one of us.

22:47.881 --> 22:53.652
I'm assuming that you got the
pot from one of your band mates?

22:53.687 --> 22:57.890
I'm never going to do it again.

22:57.924 --> 23:01.660
I probably should have warned
you. We're not exactly pot people.

23:01.695 --> 23:03.929
Of course nobody should be.

23:03.963 --> 23:06.799
But, I freaked out when I tried it too.

23:11.538 --> 23:14.907
Being in a band doesn't mean
you have to act like a rock star.

23:14.941 --> 23:17.843
That goes for alcohol, too.

23:17.877 --> 23:20.679
- OK.
- I'm very happy that you're playing music again

23:20.714 --> 23:23.615
but if being in this
band affects your grades

23:23.650 --> 23:25.551
or your judgment again, you're done.

23:25.618 --> 23:28.487
Yeah, I get it.

23:28.521 --> 23:30.956
I don't like having to
be the hard ass, Brandon.

23:30.990 --> 23:34.760
- Don't.
- Why do you have to be?

23:37.697 --> 23:39.798
Because someone has to.

23:41.735 --> 23:44.636
You'll understand one day
when you have kids of your own.

23:44.671 --> 23:47.873
I can't believe I just said that.

23:47.907 --> 23:49.875
Dinner's in thirty minutes, OK?

24:00.553 --> 24:03.489
You know, it also has a massage setting.

24:03.523 --> 24:05.724
And memory foam so it
contours to your body.

24:05.759 --> 24:07.526
Well then, why are you selling it?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.828
It's too big. It takes up the whole room.

24:09.863 --> 24:12.564
Well, I don't believe my
bedroom's any bigger than this.

24:12.599 --> 24:14.533
Maybe it's too big for me too.

24:14.567 --> 24:18.904
It's not too big, it's just,
it's not good for... intimacy,

24:18.938 --> 24:20.839
because of the split between the beds.

24:20.874 --> 24:23.509
That's why we're selling it.

24:23.543 --> 24:27.646
Oh... Well, that's no issue.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.848
At my age, the less intimacy the better.

24:29.883 --> 24:31.850
Then this is the bed for you, I think.

24:31.885 --> 24:34.787
Oh, I hear a little squeaking sound.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.789
Probably needs some maintenance.

24:36.823 --> 24:37.790
I don't hear anything.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.758
You know, it's illegal to sell a used bed.

24:39.793 --> 24:42.728
- Not privately.
- And she would know, she's a cop.

24:42.762 --> 24:44.830
Ah. The fuzz, eh?

24:44.864 --> 24:48.567
Well, it's not worth it but
I'll give you $500 bucks.

24:48.601 --> 24:51.804
We're asking for twenty-five hundred.
And it sells for twice that new!

24:51.838 --> 24:54.640
But it's not new, it's used and it squeaks.

24:54.674 --> 24:56.775
- It doesn't squeak.
- Fifteen hundred.

24:56.810 --> 24:57.743
Mom, we can get more for it.

24:57.777 --> 24:59.511
- Seven-fifty.
- Twelve-fifty.

24:59.546 --> 25:00.846
- Please.
- One thousand, my last offer.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.548
Sold.

25:02.582 --> 25:04.817
Hey, you just made a hundred dollars.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.718
Sixty.

25:10.757 --> 25:12.925
It's been so long since you've
all gotten in bed with us.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.693
This is nice.

25:14.727 --> 25:17.314
Which reminds me, we have to
go shopping for a new mattress

25:17.315 --> 25:18.975
tomorrow after your doctor's appointment.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.956
- Hopefully we'll get same-day delivery.
- Yes.

25:20.969 --> 25:22.936
Or, I guess, I'm sleeping
on the floor tomorrow night?

25:22.971 --> 25:25.906
- 'Fraid so.
- Just make sure that old bag pays you in cash.

25:25.940 --> 25:27.975
Hey, hey, hey. Language, please.

25:28.009 --> 25:29.109
What time's your appointment tomorrow?

25:29.144 --> 25:30.844
Nine A.M.

25:30.879 --> 25:31.912
Will you let us know what she says?

25:31.946 --> 25:33.814
I will text you immediately.

25:33.848 --> 25:35.249
Where are you going to put the baby's crib?

25:35.283 --> 25:38.285
We were thinking right here, by the window.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.921
B, you're awfully quiet tonight.

25:40.955 --> 25:43.123
He's not as quiet as Jude is.

25:45.260 --> 25:46.960
I'm just kidding.

25:50.932 --> 25:53.100
I do miss your sweet, sweet voice.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.935
Now, shut up and roll.

25:57.038 --> 25:59.873
Oh, oh!

25:59.908 --> 26:01.975
Park Place. Pay me, sucka!

26:02.010 --> 26:04.945
And there's a hotel. You
are in big trouble, bud.

26:04.979 --> 26:06.013
Ohh.

26:06.047 --> 26:08.115
My turn. All right.

26:35.307 --> 26:36.841
What's going on?

26:39.978 --> 26:42.847
I don't understand how this
can happen overnight, literally.

26:42.881 --> 26:46.250
Preeclampsia can go from
mild to severe very quickly.

26:46.285 --> 26:48.920
Well, there must be another medication.

26:48.954 --> 26:54.125
There's protein in your urine and your blood
pressure is dangerously high and rising.

26:54.159 --> 26:56.961
At this point, all we can do is
deliver the baby and the placenta...

26:56.995 --> 26:58.229
as soon as possible.

26:58.263 --> 27:00.831
But the baby's only 20 weeks.

27:00.866 --> 27:02.199
How many weeks does she have to be?

27:02.234 --> 27:05.937
The earliest a premie
can survive is 24 weeks

27:05.971 --> 27:10.107
and even then there's only a 35% chance.

27:10.142 --> 27:14.045
Then we wait... another six to
eight weeks. Whatever it takes.

27:14.079 --> 27:16.781
It's not just about the baby.

27:16.815 --> 27:20.084
You could have a stroke, or
impaired liver or kidney function.

27:20.118 --> 27:22.920
It's maternal mortality
that's the risk here.

27:22.955 --> 27:27.258
OK. But this is all just
worse case scenario stuff.

27:27.292 --> 27:29.260
I could still respond to the
blood pressure medication,

27:29.294 --> 27:31.720
I can stay here in the
hospital, I can stay on bed rest.

27:31.721 --> 27:32.926
There's still a chance, right?

27:34.731 --> 27:36.532
One I wouldn't recommend taking.

27:39.902 --> 27:41.803
I'll leave you to talk.

27:44.907 --> 27:46.975
I'm gonna be right back, OK?

27:50.847 --> 27:53.949
Excuse me. What are we gonna do?

27:53.983 --> 27:55.917
We can't make her deliver against her will.

27:55.952 --> 27:57.069
Even if she could die?

27:57.254 --> 27:59.154
Legally, we have to respect her wishes.

27:59.189 --> 28:00.589
But she's isn't in crisis yet.

28:00.624 --> 28:03.425
I know it's scary,

28:03.460 --> 28:07.329
but let's give her a
little time to process this.

28:07.364 --> 28:08.497
OK?

28:08.681 --> 28:10.315
Yeah. Thank you.

28:21.828 --> 28:22.761
Come here.

28:28.802 --> 28:30.669
I saw her, in a dream.

28:30.703 --> 28:32.771
She was in our bed with us

28:32.806 --> 28:36.775
and she was beautiful and she was healthy.

28:36.810 --> 28:39.445
I can feel her inside me.

28:39.479 --> 28:41.780
I have faith.

28:41.815 --> 28:43.482
Even if it takes a miracle.

28:43.516 --> 28:46.385
She's gonna be all right,
she's going to make it.

28:49.722 --> 28:52.524
I don't have faith.

28:54.494 --> 28:58.630
That's OK. Because I have
enough for the both of us.

29:10.477 --> 29:13.645
So... Mama's gonna be all right.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.547
What about the baby?

29:15.582 --> 29:19.751
Um... it doesn't look good.

29:26.459 --> 29:27.626
So what can we do?

29:27.660 --> 29:30.429
You can support Mama.

29:30.463 --> 29:32.631
And love her.

29:32.665 --> 29:34.533
OK?

29:34.567 --> 29:35.801
Grandma's here.

30:11.838 --> 30:13.572
It's OK.

30:13.606 --> 30:15.574
It's all right, baby.

30:15.608 --> 30:16.742
It's OK.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.882
Is Lena OK?

30:51.916 --> 30:53.851
Grandma's still in with her.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.654
I feel so sad.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.024
Yeah, me too.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.594
You should call Wyatt.

31:03.628 --> 31:04.928
Why?

31:04.963 --> 31:07.698
He's your boyfriend, right?

31:07.732 --> 31:08.866
Right.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.038
I met him yesterday.

31:14.072 --> 31:15.939
You ran into Wyatt?

31:15.974 --> 31:20.611
He asked to meet. To talk. About you.

31:20.645 --> 31:23.047
Why? What did he say?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.884
Ah...

31:26.918 --> 31:30.854
Just that things were good
and then something happened.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.889
Did he say what?

31:31.923 --> 31:34.024
No.

31:35.126 --> 31:38.062
He was just wondering...

31:39.731 --> 31:40.864
... if it had to do with me.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.711
We tried to have sex.

31:54.746 --> 31:58.682
I freaked out. I had
like... a panic attack.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.654
At first, I did think...

32:03.688 --> 32:04.988
maybe I wasn't over you.

32:05.023 --> 32:08.092
But, then I realized...

32:08.126 --> 32:09.860
Is it because of Liam?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.033
Why don't you just tell Wyatt.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.768
Because, I don't want to.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.970
And I really wish he hadn't involved you.

32:20.004 --> 32:20.971
Well, me too.

32:21.005 --> 32:22.739
But...

32:24.042 --> 32:26.076
I know how it feels to love you

32:26.111 --> 32:29.046
and not know why you're pulling away.

32:29.080 --> 32:32.983
It's a lonely place to be.

32:33.017 --> 32:34.051
And frankly, it's not OK.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.886
I really don't want to talk about this.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.654
Of course you don't.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.090
But you never want to talk
about things that are hard.

32:40.125 --> 32:45.662
But keeping stuff inside
doesn't make it hurt less.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.898
You just hurt the people you shut out.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.668
We should get back inside.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.980
I know that this sounds so selfish,

33:03.014 --> 33:07.851
but everyone in the house is
connected to somebody by blood.

33:10.722 --> 33:14.625
I know that you don't need that
to be a family, I know that.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.929
But sometimes I'm afraid that...

33:21.900 --> 33:25.068
... they won't love me
as much as I love them

33:25.103 --> 33:27.604
because I'm not their biological mom.

33:29.107 --> 33:32.843
That they won't have
that to tether them to me,

33:32.877 --> 33:36.013
when I'm driving them crazy or
I won't give them what they want.

33:36.047 --> 33:38.849
Or I fail them.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.687
That they'll just...

33:45.723 --> 33:48.792
that they'll look at me and they'll
say, "You're not my real mom."

33:48.826 --> 33:50.794
And walk away.

33:54.098 --> 33:57.568
Honey, to be honest,

33:57.602 --> 34:01.805
every mother's afraid that our children
won't love us the way we love them.

34:01.839 --> 34:05.809
And they won't. Not in the same way.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.878
Biology or not.

34:07.912 --> 34:10.947
That's the way it's supposed to be.

34:10.982 --> 34:16.853
Mothers and fathers, we have
to love our children more...

34:18.790 --> 34:21.625
... in order to make the sacrifices

34:21.659 --> 34:25.629
it takes to put them first.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.898
But one thing is true.

34:27.931 --> 34:32.636
Love will always be a
stronger bond than blood.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.973
Trust that.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.876
And those children out there love you.

34:41.946 --> 34:44.614
They need you.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.819
They can't lose you.

34:51.723 --> 34:55.993
Their needs trump your wants.

34:57.629 --> 35:02.633
And that's what being a
real mother is all about.

35:26.090 --> 35:29.593
Hey, Mom. I've been thinking...

35:29.627 --> 35:32.629
I want you to keep the
commission on the bed, OK?

35:33.765 --> 35:35.032
I'm sorry.

35:35.099 --> 35:36.667
I love you, baby.

35:49.747 --> 35:52.749
I know you're angry we don't
have the same birth father.

35:55.053 --> 35:58.622
And that I have a half-sister
and that I wanted to meet her.

35:58.656 --> 36:02.726
And I know you're angry that we
couldn't get adopted together.

36:02.760 --> 36:07.698
And you don't feel like you
have any say over anything.

36:07.732 --> 36:11.902
But you do. When it comes to me, you do.

36:15.039 --> 36:18.909
I won't ever see Sophia
again if it hurts you.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.978
And there is nothing you can ever say to me

36:22.013 --> 36:24.047
that's gonna make me run away again.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.819
But you have to talk to me.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.755
And to the people who love you.

36:31.789 --> 36:33.623
You can't shut us out.

36:36.794 --> 36:40.697
It's selfish. And you're not selfish.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.622
OK.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.918
So, is Lena going to be OK?

37:34.952 --> 37:37.954
Yeah, for now.

37:39.056 --> 37:41.691
But she lost the baby so...

37:42.760 --> 37:45.762
That's so sad.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.764
I'm really sorry.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.835
We all are.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.940
I'm also sorry...

37:56.974 --> 38:01.545
that I haven't told you why I couldn't...

38:08.052 --> 38:09.953
I was raped.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.930
Was it that guy, who...

38:19.964 --> 38:21.998
Yeah. Yeah.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.638
I thought I put it behind me.

38:29.774 --> 38:31.908
But it turns out I...

38:31.943 --> 38:36.746
still have some stuff
I have to work through.

38:37.949 --> 38:42.052
So I'm gonna need some space to do that.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.724
OK.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.061
Take as long as you need.

38:58.002 --> 39:03.540
All I ever ask from you is this...

39:04.976 --> 39:06.743
is to talk to me.

39:30.950 --> 39:31.950
Hi.

39:31.985 --> 39:33.986
Hi.

39:34.020 --> 39:36.622
- What's your name?
- Layla.

39:36.656 --> 39:40.726
That's a beautiful name.
I like your unicorn.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.695
- She talks.
- Oh, she does?

39:43.730 --> 39:47.666
- What does she say?
- Lots of stuff.

39:50.136 --> 39:51.737
Where's your mommy?

39:53.039 --> 39:56.642
- Are you sick?
- No. Not really.

39:56.676 --> 39:58.710
Then why are you in the hospital?

39:58.745 --> 40:03.115
Layla! There you are. What are you doing?

40:03.149 --> 40:05.984
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.

40:06.019 --> 40:08.020
What did I tell you about wandering off?

40:08.054 --> 40:10.122
- Wait.
- Layla.

40:10.156 --> 40:12.758
She has to tell me something.

40:17.964 --> 40:20.065
Are you sure?

40:20.099 --> 40:21.967
OK.

40:22.001 --> 40:25.771
Here. She says she wants to stay with you.

40:30.129 --> 40:32.864
- Won't you miss her?
- It's OK.

40:35.101 --> 40:36.968
Thank you.

40:39.071 --> 40:41.806
Wait a second.

40:43.042 --> 40:46.077
- What's her name?
- Frankie.

41:01.060 --> 41:05.930
A cherry tree symbolizes
birth, death and new awakening.

41:05.965 --> 41:08.099
We've planted it for you, Frankie.

41:08.134 --> 41:13.138
This tree, which blooms
brilliantly but briefly each year,

41:13.172 --> 41:18.743
will remind us that life is precious
and we need to live each day out loud,

41:18.811 --> 41:21.012
and never forget how lucky
we are to have this family

41:21.047 --> 41:22.881
that you will always be part of,

41:22.915 --> 41:27.118
where you live in our hearts, forever.
