00:13.446 --> 00:15.749
Hey, those are
for my French class.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.751
Oh, but I love sprinkles.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.019
Fine. Just eat it.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.354
Hey, I'm really
hungry, too.

00:21.387 --> 00:22.255
Please.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.824
Just take
the plain, okay?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.258
Oh, thank you.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.327
Oh.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.261
Ah!

00:28.294 --> 00:30.396
People are
walking here, okay?

00:30.430 --> 00:31.431
God!

00:32.032 --> 00:33.433
Now they're dirty.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.301
So just eat them.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.740
Here.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.074
Thanks.

00:42.275 --> 00:43.510
What? What's
your problem?

00:43.544 --> 00:46.513
My problem
is your face, dirtbag.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.549
Ooh hoo hoo!

00:48.582 --> 00:49.916
What's wrong with her?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.417
Ricky dumped her
this morning.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.186
I don't know.
She's on the warpath.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.922
Well, if she's
looking for
new customers,

00:55.956 --> 00:57.791
I'm up for
a test drive.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.660
(LAUGHING)
Shut up, Daniel.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.529
Karen, wait up!

01:02.563 --> 01:04.665
Jeez, Perry,
you're looking huge.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.933
Yeah? Well,
I been workin' out
after school.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.434

(GIGGLES)

01:08.468 --> 01:09.503
Ooh!

01:09.536 --> 01:10.537
Sorry, little guy.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.205
I didn't see ya.
You all right, pal?

01:12.238 --> 01:13.540
Huh?
Yeah.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.608
All right.

01:14.641 --> 01:15.776
Hey, you okay?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.210
I can't breathe.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.379
That guy hit you
in the solar plexus.

01:22.949 --> 01:24.384
Fellas...

01:24.417 --> 01:28.622
My brother
sent me this
amazing chem set.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.357
I propose after school
we make some acid,
pour it on the sidewalk,

01:31.391 --> 01:32.959
and watch it kill bugs.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.394
(BANG)

01:36.362 --> 01:38.599
What are you doing?
That's my locker.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.536
Oh... I'm sorry.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.739
I didn't know.
I thought it was mine.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.508
See? This is mine.

01:47.541 --> 01:50.410
I just got hit
in the solar plexus, so
I'm a little out of it.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.813
I don't wanna hear
your life story, okay?

01:52.846 --> 01:54.380
I want you to move your ass!

01:57.851 --> 02:02.488
Hey, Karen,
was this guy trying to
break into your locker?

02:03.489 --> 02:05.491
No! No.
I was just confused.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.393
You know, I thought
it was my locker.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.630
Yeah. You are
very confused, pee‐wee.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.998
Are you sure you're
even in the right school?

02:12.032 --> 02:13.466
How old are you?

02:13.499 --> 02:14.501
Fourteen.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.203
You can't be 14,
midget.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.372
You haven't
even hit puberty.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.043
What are you doing?

02:23.076 --> 02:24.210
I knew it.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.979
You don't even have hair
on your pits.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.181
Come on, Karen. Let's go.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.183
You swear you're 14?

02:30.784 --> 02:32.252
Then you're a geek.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.789
This is your locker?

02:41.795 --> 02:46.232
There. Now you'll always
know which one's yours
and which one's mine.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.801
Okay, geek?

DANIEL: So why
did Ricky break up
with Karen?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.476
Is she,
like, a prude?

04:03.510 --> 04:06.112
Did she not,
you know...

04:06.146 --> 04:07.180
Go the distance?

04:07.213 --> 04:08.782
(LAUGHING)

04:08.815 --> 04:10.150
Distance? (CHUCKLES)

04:10.183 --> 04:12.352
No. She's not a prude.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.921
She's a slut, obviously.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.322
Obviously.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.991
She's a friend
of yours.

04:18.024 --> 04:22.295
Last week,
she started getting it on
with Ricky's older brother.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.864
DANIEL: Oh, cool.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.465
Yesterday...

04:26.332 --> 04:28.434
He walked in on them.

04:28.468 --> 04:29.870
Ew!

04:29.903 --> 04:31.505
Who walked in on who?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.940
"Who walked in on who?"

04:33.974 --> 04:37.343
God, people
are so gossipy
at this school.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.780
It's, like, get a life,
you know?

04:40.246 --> 04:41.481
Eh...

04:43.183 --> 04:44.585

04:47.621 --> 04:48.722
Oh.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.256

Uh, that's Gary Moss' seat.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.233
Oh.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.835
But he's sick.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.336
He has impetigo.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.581
What?

05:14.615 --> 05:15.749
Are you gonna
sit over here now?

05:15.782 --> 05:18.719
I just don't feel like
being abused today.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.453
I mean, I give up,
you know?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.122
I go out of my way
to be nice to her,

05:22.155 --> 05:23.590
and it's like, unh!

05:23.624 --> 05:26.259
No matter what I do,
you know?

05:26.292 --> 05:27.528
Oh!

05:27.561 --> 05:28.562
Mmm!

05:29.763 --> 05:30.797
Are you okay?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.432
Mm‐hmm.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.902
Look, I'm gonna go talk
to Kim right now.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.403
No. No, no, no. Don't.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.806
Yeah, I am. Becau...

05:40.473 --> 05:41.775

05:41.808 --> 05:44.477
Lindsay, it's really cool
when you hang out,

05:44.511 --> 05:47.614
and she shouldn't
ruin everything
for everybody

05:47.648 --> 05:51.151
just because she's
always on her period,
you know?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.353
No, Nick, it's okay.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.088
No, it's not okay.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.191
It's... You know,
it's not okay.
That's the thing.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.325
Just... Please don't.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.961
Don't say anything to her.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.697
Promise me you won't.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.368
Yeah. All right. Okay.

she inspected your pits.

supposed to do?

you don't fight girls.

You don't
piss your pants
at school.

Hey, I didn't
piss my pants!

06:52.212 --> 06:54.915
Hey! What happened
to my artwork?

06:56.049 --> 06:57.918
I spent a lot
of time on that!

gonna remember where
your locker is?

have to fight you.

You wanna fight me, huh?

07:13.900 --> 07:16.169

You wanna mix it up
a little bit?

What was that,

It was him.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.079
Are you guys deformed
or something?

07:26.112 --> 07:28.048
I mean, what's the deal?

07:28.081 --> 07:31.652
Look, I guess
I'm just gonna have to
mark that locker again.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.755

in geek blood.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.590

get to class.

I hope she meant
your geek blood.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.743
Oh, Kim wants me
to wait for her.

quit yelling at me,

can be a drag.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.389
I heard about what she does
in the yearbook darkroom.

09:16.422 --> 09:17.758
What she does?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.094
What?

09:21.127 --> 09:23.196
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.166
She does it.

Okay?

09:32.973 --> 09:34.508
I doubt it.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.309
And so what
if she does?

10:23.724 --> 10:24.958
So this is your locker?

10:24.991 --> 10:25.859
Yeah.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.628
No. This is
the school's locker.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.229
That's gonna have to
be repainted, bub.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.330
It wasn't me.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.998
This wasn't you?

10:32.566 --> 10:34.167
Well, yeah, but...

10:34.200 --> 10:36.369
You kids don't respect
school property.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.505
I mean,
you just don't get it.

10:38.539 --> 10:41.508
Okay, I want you
to write an essay

10:41.542 --> 10:44.010
by tomorrow, 500 words...

10:44.044 --> 10:47.648
"Why vandalism...
Why the property
of school

10:47.681 --> 10:51.251
"should be respected
and why we should
respect it."

10:51.284 --> 10:52.986
And I want that essay
on my desk tomorrow,

10:53.019 --> 10:55.421
or you're gonna be on
trash detail for a week,
you got me?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.157
(LAUGHING)

10:57.791 --> 10:59.225
Yeah. Laugh it up.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.399
(LAUGHTER)

11:08.368 --> 11:11.304
Hey, Lindsay,
where you goin'?

11:11.972 --> 11:13.039
I dunno.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.007
Home.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.276
Well, what are you
doing later?

11:16.510 --> 11:17.711
What?

11:20.647 --> 11:22.949
Do you wanna come over
to my house for dinner?

11:23.249 --> 11:24.384
Uh...

11:25.686 --> 11:27.387
Did Nick say
something to you?

11:27.420 --> 11:28.454
What do you mean?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.592
Did Nick tell you
to be nice to me?

11:31.625 --> 11:34.260
Well... Yeah.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.998
You know, I just figured
since we have to see each
other anyways all the time,

11:38.031 --> 11:39.766
we may as well try
to get along.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.403
So do you wanna come over
to my house or not?

11:44.070 --> 11:45.305
I don't know.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.307
You know what?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.775
Fine. Just forget it.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.310
You know, I tried.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.444
Kim!

11:53.413 --> 11:54.414
Yeah.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.349
Yeah, what?

11:57.618 --> 11:59.620
Yeah, I'll have dinner
at your house.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.054
All right.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.025
My parents are jerks.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.827
They love
to kill my buzz,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.995
but afterwards
we can ditch 'em,
and, I dunno,

12:09.029 --> 12:10.430
go catch a movie
or something?

12:10.697 --> 12:11.732
Okay.

12:11.765 --> 12:12.833
All right.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.901
I'll pick you up
at your house at 5:30.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.236
Okay.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.774
I'll see you at 5:30!

12:21.274 --> 12:23.176
Yeah. Later.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.521
Hey, honey.
How was school?

12:34.555 --> 12:36.422
I don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.825
Oh, okay, then.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.494
Samuel, you are going
to ruin your dinner.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.663
I'm loading up
on carbs.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.165
But we're having carbs
for dinner.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.401
You want me to stay a midget?
Is that what you want?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.070
You are not a midget.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.607
Yeah, I am, and it's
because there's no food
in this house.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.675
I'm malnourished.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.309
No food?

12:56.342 --> 12:58.211
What's all this?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.145
Huh?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.848
Fruit Roll‐Ups,
beef jerky.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.650
You're just...

13:03.684 --> 13:05.085
You're just finicky.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.588
Mom, is it okay
if I skip out on
dinner tonight?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.856
What? Why?

13:09.890 --> 13:11.925
Well, I was invited
over to Kim Kelly's.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.828
Who's Kim Kelly?

13:14.861 --> 13:16.229
LINDSAY: She's
just a friend.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.363
Oh, new friend?

13:17.397 --> 13:18.832
What's she like?

13:18.865 --> 13:21.201
I don't know.
She's just a girl.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.905
Kim Kelly's a psycho.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.975
She and Karen Scarfoli...

13:29.009 --> 13:31.311
Well, uh...
They're violent.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.914
They run around
the school being evil.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.448
That doesn't sound
very nice.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.651
Why do you want
to be friends with
a girl like that?

13:37.684 --> 13:39.653
Ahh, she's
not evil, Mom.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.054
She's just different.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.689
She doesn't
wear frilly dresses

13:42.723 --> 13:44.691
or prance around
like a cheerleader.

13:44.725 --> 13:46.593
Just 'cause a girl
speaks her mind

13:46.627 --> 13:48.028
doesn't mean
she's a psycho.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.996
Well, you should
have told me yesterday.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.798
I'm making veal piccata.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.399
Maybe another night.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.936
Mom, she's
coming to pick me up
in 15 minutes.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.338
Fine.
Eat with your friend.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.050
Why are you friends
with Kim Kelly?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.853
Don't talk to me, okay?

14:12.886 --> 14:14.354
Kim Kelly's
my enemy.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.790
Look, if you're gonna
start bein' a tattletale

14:16.823 --> 14:18.091
and tryin' to get me
into trouble,

14:18.124 --> 14:20.393
then maybe you should go
to a different high school.

14:20.426 --> 14:24.030
I don't need some spy
reporting on my every move.

14:24.064 --> 14:28.635
I just don't know why
you have to hang out
with her.

14:28.669 --> 14:30.003
Why not?

14:30.036 --> 14:34.908
Well, because
she and her friends
are mean to me.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.777
They wrote "geek"
on my locker.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.579
Well, maybe
you are a geek.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.618
I'm just kidding.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.889
Oh, come on, Sam,
like I meant that.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.659
Hey, move it
or lose it.

14:52.693 --> 14:54.460
(LAUGHS)

14:57.731 --> 15:00.066
Oh, man!
I got the worst cramps.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.935
I just about died
on the way over here.

15:02.468 --> 15:03.537
Hey, Kim.

15:06.607 --> 15:08.308
Can you do me a favor?

15:08.341 --> 15:11.244
Can you quit picking
on my little brother?

15:11.277 --> 15:12.879
Oh, yeah.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.281
I keep forgetting
he's your little brother.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.418
He looks just like
all those other geeks.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.920
Come on. Let's go.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.891
I hate Lindsay
and her stupid friends.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.793
You don't hate
your sister.

15:26.827 --> 15:29.329
Yeah, I do. She sucks.

15:29.362 --> 15:33.166
Samuel, don't ever use
that disgusting word
again.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.200
Sorry.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.552
All right,
I'm warning you
right now.

15:51.585 --> 15:53.319
My parents
are seriously wacko.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.755
Yeah. Mine, too.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.822
Don't worry about it.

15:55.856 --> 15:57.691
No. Mine
are mental, okay?

15:58.424 --> 15:59.626
Uh... Okay.

15:59.660 --> 16:02.295
They're looking
for a reason to
sell my Gremlin.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.163
They are?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.365
God, they're such
cheap bastards!

16:05.398 --> 16:08.669
But my Aunt Kathy
gave me this car,
and it's mine.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.170
Right.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.972
My Aunt Kathy
was so rad.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.139
She lived in L. A.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.841
She was on <i>Kojak.</i>

16:14.875 --> 16:17.578
She doinked Ryan O'Neal
once at a party.

16:17.611 --> 16:20.246
Wow! She sounds awesome.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.682
Yeah. Well, she's dead.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.722
There's a lot riding
on this dinner.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.324
I can't lose my car.
You get it?

16:33.026 --> 16:34.828
I don't know if I do.

16:34.861 --> 16:35.896
(SIGHS)

16:35.929 --> 16:37.864
Roll up my window.

16:37.898 --> 16:40.200
I don't want my car
to get stolen.

16:43.904 --> 16:45.739
My parents
hate everybody.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.107
They hate Daniel.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.408
They can't
stand Karen.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.977
The only person that
they like is you.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.079
But I've never
even met them.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.349
Yeah. Well, I told them
all about you,

16:56.382 --> 16:59.219
how you're
like this golden girl
and everything,

16:59.252 --> 17:01.287
How you get good grades.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.624
My mother's going
to be pressing you
for information.

17:03.657 --> 17:05.726
Just follow my lead.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.160
Oh, and by the way,

17:07.193 --> 17:08.795
I spend the night
at your house
every Friday night.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.497
And last weekend, we
went up to your vacation
house in Benton Harbor

17:11.532 --> 17:12.633
and went water‐skiing.

17:12.666 --> 17:13.900
Wait... What?

17:13.934 --> 17:16.837
Hi there.
You must be Lindsay.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.371
Yeah.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.574
It's really nice
to meet you.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.042
Oh.

17:22.075 --> 17:25.646
Kim, did you
pick up any soda?

17:25.679 --> 17:27.113
I forgot.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.349
Yeah?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.586
Well, I forgot
to make you dinner.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.754
How do you like that?

17:33.787 --> 17:34.788
Come on in.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.198
So...

17:45.231 --> 17:47.400
Kim says
you're a genius.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.902
No, I'm not.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.837
At all.

17:50.871 --> 17:51.938
(COUGHING)

17:51.972 --> 17:55.942
I... I get good grades,
I guess.

17:55.976 --> 17:57.911
Well, why don't you
help out Kim?

17:57.944 --> 17:59.713
She's hangin' on
for dear life.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.915
B.S. I get good grades.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.517
Oh, I hate to
blow your mind, sister,

18:03.550 --> 18:05.652
but Ds are not good.
Ds are bad.

18:05.686 --> 18:06.953
(CHUCKLING)

18:06.987 --> 18:09.155
I got one "D," okay?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.957
I told you
my history teacher
was a pervert.

18:10.991 --> 18:14.194
I wasn't about to go
to his house after school
to get "tutored."

18:14.227 --> 18:16.697
Can it, Kim. You're
gonna wake up Chip.

18:16.730 --> 18:18.665
(SNORING)

18:23.136 --> 18:25.138
At least
I know how to read.

18:26.006 --> 18:27.473
What was that?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.343
Nothing.

18:30.376 --> 18:33.814
So... I hear you girls
had a fun weekend.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.549
Yeah, it was great.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.952
We went water‐skiing.
I love to water‐ski.

18:38.985 --> 18:42.422
And, uh, you got
a vacation house up there
in Benton Harbor?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.857
Mm‐hmm.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.425
That must be nice, huh?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.027
Your family
must be very wealthy.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.294
Hardly.
(THUMP)

18:48.328 --> 18:50.864
Kim says that you
are, uh, affluent.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.398
Well, we do all right.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.668
You know, I'm really not
supposed to talk about it.

18:54.701 --> 18:58.471
My dad always says
a farmer never reveals
how many cows he's got.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.640
(LAUGHS)

18:59.673 --> 19:01.241
Your old man's a farmer?

19:01.274 --> 19:04.377
No. He owns, um,
A‐1 Sporting Goods.

19:04.678 --> 19:05.979
Really?

19:06.012 --> 19:07.380
Can he
get us a discount?

(SIGHS)

19:09.950 --> 19:11.417
What?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.854
Well, we don't live
in a mansion here,
as you can see.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.856
We don't have
a swimming pool
and tennis court,

19:15.889 --> 19:16.957
the way you do.

19:16.990 --> 19:21.061
Hey, we may not be rich,
but we get by.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.328
We're remodelin'.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.864
Oh, and take your time
with that.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.199
I love relievin' myself
behind a shower curtain.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.638
Ew!

19:31.672 --> 19:32.906
Smells like fart.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.610
Here.
Hold this test tube.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.611
Yeah, right.

19:37.644 --> 19:40.013
I'm not gonna get
my fingers melted off

19:40.046 --> 19:42.849
just so you
can get a kick, okay?

19:42.883 --> 19:43.984
I need these fingers.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.819
Why? So you can
pick your rumpus?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.087
Just hold the test tube.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.089
No. I read
in this magazine

19:49.122 --> 19:52.258
about a chemical
that burns your flesh.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.794
Okay, this kid just got
a little bit on him

19:53.827 --> 19:56.262
and now he's
goin' to Disneyland
for his last hoorah.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.632
You... You guys...

19:59.399 --> 20:00.534
I'm writing an essay.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.870
Could you just, like,
be quiet, please?

20:03.904 --> 20:05.105
Okay?

20:05.138 --> 20:06.406
Sorry.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.642

20:31.031 --> 20:32.999

a guy.

Sam, if it was me,

20:37.738 --> 20:41.341

Karen Scarfoli's house
and make her write it.

Yeah, I'm sure you would.
I would.

humiliate you like that

20:48.014 --> 20:50.016

20:50.751 --> 20:53.186

A few years.

21:12.873 --> 21:15.542

I did waitress up there
one summer,

21:15.576 --> 21:17.077

pretty good.

It's not a race.

30:10.944 --> 30:12.546

30:12.579 --> 30:15.549
Well, he usually
never eats,

30:15.582 --> 30:17.250
and just look at him.

30:18.585 --> 30:19.886
Oh, he's fine.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.122
He could use
a little meat
on his bones.

he might have worms.

you might have worms?

hates going there

stay out all night

believe a word you say.

40:05.405 --> 40:07.307
Hi. Hey, Mr. Weir.

40:07.340 --> 40:08.575
Hi, Mrs. Weir.

40:08.609 --> 40:10.343
I just want you to know
it's, like,

40:10.376 --> 40:12.879
such a pleasure
to meet you guys finally.

40:14.848 --> 40:17.083
Uh, Lindsay
turned out great!

40:17.117 --> 40:19.820
She's... So great.

40:19.853 --> 40:21.087
Congratulations.

40:22.122 --> 40:23.223
Thanks.

40:23.256 --> 40:24.858
NICK: Hey, so, um, listen,

40:26.893 --> 40:29.530
do you guys mind
if I have this
Fruit Roll‐Up?

40:29.563 --> 40:32.633
Oh, no. Please... Go...
Please, go ahead.

40:32.666 --> 40:34.200
Enjoy.

40:34.234 --> 40:35.669
Thank you so much.

40:35.702 --> 40:36.803
Sure.

40:36.837 --> 40:39.540
(KIM LAUGHING)

40:39.573 --> 40:41.441
I think
they've made up.

40:41.474 --> 40:42.976
Let's go check
on them.

40:43.009 --> 40:44.678
Mom, no.
Oh, Lindsay.

40:44.711 --> 40:47.347
I think
we deserve to see
a happy ending,

40:47.380 --> 40:48.715
don't you, Harold?

40:48.749 --> 40:50.150
(LAUGHTER)

40:50.183 --> 40:51.384
These friends of yours

40:51.417 --> 40:52.886
going to be leaving
our house in
the near future?

40:52.919 --> 40:53.920
Mom, wait.

40:55.121 --> 40:56.122
KIM: Ohh!

40:58.191 --> 40:59.492
Oh, my.

41:04.264 --> 41:05.732
Oh, hey, uh, Mr. Weir.

41:05.766 --> 41:08.334
Listen, uh, I just
wanted to tell you

41:08.368 --> 41:09.836
I think you got
a great store.

41:09.870 --> 41:11.738
There's a lot
of great stuff
in there.

41:11.772 --> 41:14.174
I bought a basketball
in there a couple
of years ago.

41:14.207 --> 41:15.742
It still works
and everything.

41:15.776 --> 41:16.810
Good.

41:16.843 --> 41:18.478
Hey, listen, you guys mind
if I have these or...

41:18.512 --> 41:20.013
Oh, please,
go ahead.
Take them.

41:20.046 --> 41:21.147
Thanks.

41:21.181 --> 41:23.950
Thanks so much for dinner
and ice cream and everything.

41:23.984 --> 41:27.554
It was really good
to meet you guys.

41:27.588 --> 41:28.855
Super nice.

41:30.557 --> 41:32.058
Good luck
with your parents.

41:32.092 --> 41:33.794
Oof! Don't remind me.

41:33.827 --> 41:37.463
Hey, you think it's cool
if I leave my car
here tonight?

41:37.497 --> 41:39.099
I'll pick it up tomorrow.

41:39.132 --> 41:40.366
We could hang out.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.802
Great.

41:43.770 --> 41:46.172
Maybe we can all
have dinner tomorrow night.

41:52.312 --> 41:53.847
Well, I got
a ton of homework to do,

41:53.880 --> 41:56.149
so I guess I better
go hit the books.

41:56.182 --> 41:57.217
Huh, Dad?

41:59.285 --> 42:00.654
Good night.

42:03.489 --> 42:05.058
This isn't good.

42:05.425 --> 42:06.793
No.

42:12.899 --> 42:14.000
Hey.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.235
Hey, Sam.

42:16.502 --> 42:18.204
You going to class?

42:18.905 --> 42:19.906
Yeah.

42:22.509 --> 42:24.077
Hey, Sam Weir.

42:24.110 --> 42:25.646
Where's my essay?

42:32.619 --> 42:34.721
Okay. You know what
we're going to do?

42:34.755 --> 42:36.356
We're going
to post this
on your locker

42:36.389 --> 42:37.791
so that everyone
in McKinley

42:37.824 --> 42:39.893
can learn from
your little mistake.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.635
All right, I give up.

42:48.669 --> 42:50.504
If you kids want
to live in trash,

42:50.537 --> 42:52.105
that's fine by me.

42:56.342 --> 42:58.111
Did you do this?

42:59.379 --> 43:00.981
I did it.

43:01.014 --> 43:05.118
Because you are
a slut, slut.

43:05.151 --> 43:06.319
Hey, he hit on me.

43:06.352 --> 43:08.321
Oh, yeah?
Well, after school,

43:08.354 --> 43:10.190
I'm going to hit on you.

43:10.223 --> 43:11.291
See you then.

43:13.827 --> 43:14.828
Bye.

43:23.069 --> 43:26.206
Hey, Kim, thanks.
That was really cool.

43:26.239 --> 43:27.674
No problem, geek.
