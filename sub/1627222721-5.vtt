WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.878
<i>His society of children has arrived.</i>

00:03.878 --> 00:06.214
<i>They've proven
to be my only true adversaries.</i>

00:06.214 --> 00:08.508
<i>I hope you know how much I appreciate
your work on this.</i>

00:08.508 --> 00:09.884
I want you to step into the spotlight.

00:09.884 --> 00:12.053
I don't need any kind of recognition.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.471
<i>I've got something better.</i>

00:13.471 --> 00:14.973
Whisperer is just a souvenir.

00:14.973 --> 00:19.728
<i>He is inducing happiness
by using a direct synaptic access.</i>

00:19.728 --> 00:22.605
- That was brilliant.
- Curtain did his thing to you.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.357
<i>It's not just disturbing,
it's dangerous.</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.401
<i>Blink if you hear us, Sebastian.</i>

00:26.401 --> 00:29.070
- How far behind the kids are we?
- You don't want to know.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.031
<i>Speed is our priority now.</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:32.115
<i>They're palindromes.</i>

00:32.115 --> 00:34.993
Our destination must be a city in Germany

00:34.993 --> 00:37.120
- whose name is a palindrome.
- Burggrub.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.372
<i>I should have known
they weren't real water polo players.</i>

00:39.372 --> 00:41.583
<i>They must be undercover.
Working for Curtain.</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:43.793
<i>Tonight,
we each take shifts staying awake.</i>

00:43.793 --> 00:45.503
- Your turn.
- <i>If we stick together,</i>

00:45.503 --> 00:47.756
<i>I really believe we can outsmart anyone.</i>

00:47.756 --> 00:49.257
Constance is gone.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.888
I should have had some coffee.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.183
So what if caffeine
causes heart palpitations? So what?

00:58.183 --> 01:01.019
I was just so worried
I'd fall asleep when it was my turn

01:01.019 --> 01:02.937
that I couldn't get any rest
before my shift.

01:02.937 --> 01:03.980
Irony.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.900
If I could just control my anxiety,
she'd still be here.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.443
- I was doing so great, and--
- Sticky.

01:08.443 --> 01:12.030
If anyone's to blame, it's me.
I'm the reason why we're on this trip.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.907
Guys, congratulations.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.784
It's both your fault.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.371
Even though she's Constance,
she must be scared.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.624
We need to report this to the police.
Right now.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.251
We call the cops
and it's game over for us.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.504
We have no ID, no papers.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.006
They'll throw us
on the first boat home or in jail.

01:30.006 --> 01:33.510
Then what happens to Constance?
To Mr. Benedict and Number Two?

01:33.510 --> 01:35.678
We can't get taken out of the game.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.723
We have to find her ourselves.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.059
Do you know what time you fell asleep?

01:41.059 --> 01:43.645
Last time I checked my watch,
it was 4:37 a.m.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.563
So approximately 4:39?

01:46.147 --> 01:47.398
I woke up at 6:03.

01:47.398 --> 01:51.277
So somewhere during those 86 minutes,
they must have gotten off at a stop.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.905
37 to 6:03.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.366
No stops. Mm.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.576
No official stops.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.871
But the train has to come to a stop
at crossings all through the night.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.542
It could be any of these four.

02:05.542 --> 02:09.003
Okay. Find the right crossing
and we know where to start.

02:09.003 --> 02:12.382
- We're more than 30 miles away.
- Kilometers, Sticky.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.676
We got to think like Europeans
if we're tracking Europeans.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.054
48.2 kilometers. I simplified it for you.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.265
Too far to walk. No transportation.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.891
Well, we have to get it together.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.935
No one's coming to the rescue.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.063
Actually, there might be someone.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.567
Come on, team, let's go!

02:35.905 --> 02:39.200
Wraparound!

02:40.201 --> 02:41.077
<i>Plenty of seats</i>

02:41.077 --> 02:42.245
-<i>are still available</i>
- Yvette.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.747
- Out.
<i>- for Arlon Rockets home game.</i>

02:44.747 --> 02:45.874
Elena.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.044
Elena?

02:50.587 --> 02:53.590
That's just a travesty.
Terrible footwork, no intangibles.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.883
Intangibles!

02:58.428 --> 03:00.597
- You have a phone call.
- Now?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.599
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of a match?

03:03.892 --> 03:06.644
- Are you?
- Fine.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.272
Hello.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.666
Hello, Constance.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.230
Oh, yes?

04:32.230 --> 04:35.692
Thank you. You have been very helpful.
Yes, goodbye.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.612
Any luck?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.281
Yes.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.784
A group of children asked where they can
board the train to Burggrub, Germany.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.744
How do we know it was our children?

04:46.744 --> 04:49.455
One of the girls was carrying a bucket.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.082
A red bucket.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.167
We know where they're headed now.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.587
The express train to Burggrub
leaves in 30 minutes, no stops.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.839
You two will beat them there

04:57.839 --> 05:00.174
and meet them at the station
when they arrive.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.760
- What about you?
- You go on without me.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.512
We know where the children are,

05:04.512 --> 05:07.348
which is more than we can say
about Mr. Benedict and Number Two.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.560
I put some feelers out
to laboratory supply shops.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.854
Inquired if any private citizens

05:12.854 --> 05:15.356
had been ordering
neurological research equipment.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.151
Turns out someone has.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.321
I don't think Curtain is the only
armchair neuroscientist in the game.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.488
Maybe not.

05:22.488 --> 05:26.784
But the shop said the person purchased
a kilogram of Trentonium-99.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.621
Trentonium-99. It sounds familiar.

05:30.621 --> 05:34.334
It's the core element of the Whisperer.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.627
Someone is rebuilding it.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.923
I find the Whisperer, I find Curtain.
I find Curtain, I find our friends.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.759
Go. Take care of the kids.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.470
One never splits the party voluntarily.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.681
Then be careful.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.601
Unfortunately, that I can't do.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.269
You don't like her?

05:53.269 --> 05:54.979
I did the research.

05:54.979 --> 05:58.566
She has the optimal facial proportions
to create feelings of attachment.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.903
Actually, I do like her.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.072
She is optimal.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.783
Optimal size to stuff down your windpipe.

06:07.825 --> 06:08.951
Death will be swift.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.204
There's no reason for hostility.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.291
Where's Curtain?

06:15.291 --> 06:18.961
I deal directly with the boss,
not with the lackey.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.880
You think that I still work for Curtain?

06:21.547 --> 06:25.218
He publicly blamed the Emergency on me,
made me an outlaw.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.886
It's a smart play.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.598
This whole happiness technique of his,
I invented it.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.101
And then when I refused to use
my technique on human beings

06:33.101 --> 06:34.143
without further testing,

06:34.143 --> 06:37.730
knowing how dangerous
the side effects could be, he fired me.

06:37.730 --> 06:42.944
Stole my ideas, recklessly applied them,
and then stole my reputation.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.405
You need to choose better friends.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.366
But there is one thing
that he can never take away from me.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.744
- Your sense of humor?
- My inventions.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.539
They live here.

06:54.539 --> 06:58.668
And that is how I was able to rebuild
the most brilliant invention of them all.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.003
The Whisperer.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.922
And this has to do with me, how?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.466
It's my life's work.

07:05.466 --> 07:09.303
A scientific achievement
of unparalleled magnitude.

07:09.303 --> 07:15.685
I thought that it was invulnerable,
and it was to everything but your mind.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.564
Your glorious mind.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.108
The ghost in the windmill.

07:22.108 --> 07:27.071
The dancer in the dark. You found a flaw.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.699
One that has kept me up
every single night since

07:29.699 --> 07:32.076
and one that I can't seem to replicate.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.536
Why would you want to?

07:33.536 --> 07:37.373
I need to solve the problem,
and thus, I need your help.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.627
Do what you did before.
Trigger a system crash.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.214
And this time, I'll be watching,
observing exactly how you do it.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.799
No.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.471
I'm not your dancing bear. I eat bears.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.349
Do you know what other machine I rebuilt?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.810
The Brainsweeper.

07:57.810 --> 08:01.314
Completely redesigned. Twice as powerful.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.108
No more embarrassing trace memories.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.320
You won't ever remember a thing.

08:08.321 --> 08:13.409
So you decide.
The Whisperer or Brainsweeper?

08:18.581 --> 08:21.125
- Excuse me, you can't go in there.
- I need to speak with you.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.335
Now.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.212
- I tried to stop her, but--
- It's okay, Marlon.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.630
I've been expecting her.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.342
Which is why I've asked
Jean Pierre to join us.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.385
Ah.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.555
Your favorite. Crepe Suzette.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.142
Made with fresh mandarins
from the orchard. Please.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.730
I understand
that you are Mr. Benedict's kin.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.525
And I have tried
to honor and respect that.

08:46.234 --> 08:51.447
I have tried,
and I'd say succeeded, to remain civil.

08:51.447 --> 08:55.493
But not anymore.
Not after you did your thing on him.

08:56.077 --> 09:00.790
By "thing," you mean relieving him
of the constant grip of existential angst?

09:01.999 --> 09:03.209
I'm sorry that bothers you.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.504
Thank you, Jean Pierre.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.714
Here's what's going to happen.

09:08.714 --> 09:13.344
One, you are going to completely reverse
whatever it is you did to him.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.973
Two, you will immediately provide
safe passage

09:16.973 --> 09:19.100
for both of us out of this place.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.102
Fail to meet both of those conditions,

09:21.102 --> 09:25.606
and I will have no choice
but to resort to more dire tactics.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.859
Tactics that should not be spoken of
above a whisper.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.195
Consider yourself warned.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.697
I accuse.

09:39.036 --> 09:43.291
Jean Pierre. You are a magician.
A man in full.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.210
You should really try this.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.590
I'm not hungry.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.926
Have you ever wondered
what you could accomplish if you...

09:54.719 --> 09:57.471
focused on the positive things
in your life?

09:58.055 --> 10:01.142
Don't do that. I'm not falling for it.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.608
You are carrying a great deal of pain.
Aren't you?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.110
I offer this with an open heart.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.322
You hitched your professional wagon
to my brother during his lost years

10:14.322 --> 10:16.240
and squandered your potential.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.578
The bitter truth is, despite your loyalty,
despite your brilliance,

10:20.578 --> 10:23.664
despite the blood and sweat
you have poured into his service,

10:23.664 --> 10:25.541
despite all that...

10:27.084 --> 10:29.670
as long as you're a part
of his organization,

10:29.670 --> 10:32.590
you will forever be relegated
to the eponymous role of your name.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.426
"Number Two."

10:36.302 --> 10:38.554
Some say the name we are given
writes our destiny.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.931
That's why I changed mine.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.810
Nicholas is happy now.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.730
Isn't that all that matters?

10:47.730 --> 10:49.440
It's not real happiness.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.486
It's artificial. It's unthinking, shallow.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.821
Again, the negativity.

10:55.821 --> 11:00.409
You know how I know?
Pure joy triggers his narcolepsy.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.829
And he hasn't had an episode
since you... changed him.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.335
Well, I think my brother is smart enough
to decide for himself.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.755
If he truly wants to leave,
I'll grant his request.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.383
But I'm fairly certain
that he'll choose to stay.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.052
And, hopefully, so will you.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.306
We're having a workshop this afternoon
in the Great Hall.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.016
I would love to see you there.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.574
- I'll say it. I miss her.
- Me too.

11:41.158 --> 11:44.286
Terrible roommate. Good friend.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.538
Good in a crisis.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.290
Guys, this is Constance, remember?

11:48.290 --> 11:50.543
I wouldn't be surprised
if she already escaped

11:50.543 --> 11:51.919
and is on her way to Burggrub.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.343
Go time.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.391
So, the only lead we have
is that she was abducted

12:05.391 --> 12:07.435
at one of these four train crossings.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.689
- Curtain can't stop kidnapping.
- Yeah.

12:11.689 --> 12:15.609
How hell-bent on vengeance do you have
to be to go after a tiny child?

12:15.609 --> 12:17.403
I assume you put up a fight?

12:18.195 --> 12:21.699
They came in while we were asleep.
All of us.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.577
I can't believe
I once looked up to that man.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.537
Worst mistake I ever made.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.375
I mean, look at me.
I poured myself into that school.

12:31.375 --> 12:35.087
I bought in, I excelled, and no one cares.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.465
My Institute transcripts are worthless.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.009
I was laughed out
of every college I applied to.

12:40.509 --> 12:44.180
Yeah, but you're living the dream.
Playing pro tetherball. Come on.

12:44.180 --> 12:48.434
Hm. Semi-pro. "Playing" is a stretch.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.228
A few minutes in low leverage situations.

12:51.812 --> 12:55.775
But none of that matters anymore.
I have a mission.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.944
- Thanks for helping us out, Martina.
- Yeah.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.697
I don't know what we would have done
if you hadn't picked up that phone.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.949
Hey, we're going to find your friend.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.118
All you needed was a leader,
and now I'm here.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.329
I will not let you fail.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.957
Doesn't your team need this gear?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.292
Yeah, probably.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.421
But I think I'm subconsciously looking
for a confrontation.

13:17.421 --> 13:20.841
I mean, the exit velocity on my forehand
is much faster than Dubow's.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.802
I timed it. But I'm riding the bench?

13:24.303 --> 13:26.222
I'm just tired of the politics.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.350
But, hey, if they can't appreciate
what I bring...

13:30.184 --> 13:31.727
maybe they don't get a van.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.063
<i>What makes me happy?</i>

13:34.063 --> 13:35.856
Not much, really.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.651
- Going to sleep?
- You're in prison.

13:39.235 --> 13:43.364
- I am?
- A prison of your own mind.

13:43.364 --> 13:47.701
Which means you're not just a prisoner,
you're the jailer, too.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.415
Happiness is inside you.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.292
You just need to find it.

13:55.292 --> 14:00.172
Use a joyful lens to find it,
and let it free.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.307
Ah, nice.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.563
Excellent work, Auguste. Really excellent.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.815
Truly inspiring.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.820
Soon, each and every one of you,
my best and brightest ambassadors,

14:22.820 --> 14:24.446
will be able to learn this technique.

14:24.446 --> 14:29.618
And you will be empowered
to spread the joy of our work

14:29.618 --> 14:31.078
from person to person,

14:31.537 --> 14:34.999
village to village, nation to nation.

14:35.416 --> 14:40.796
No one will be left out
of our loving, loving family.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.518
Thank you.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.648
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.941
"Empowered to spread."

15:00.941 --> 15:02.818
Spread everywhere.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.614
But you seem perfectly sanguine about it.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.074
I'm not sanguine.

15:09.533 --> 15:13.621
I nod my head. I smile. I play along.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.541
Me being in my brother's good graces
could be very beneficial for us.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.127
Most beneficial for us is to get out.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.339
You are sanguine.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.925
I am undercover.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.218
Well, you say that you are,
but the minute you're with him,

15:28.218 --> 15:29.929
I just don't know anymore!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.556
Nicholas. So glad you're here.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.099
Both of you.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.019
Just a transformative experience, Nathaniel.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.813
Really? Because I'm hearing
you would like to leave.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.732
Where did you hear that?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.111
I might have mentioned it earlier
or something.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.240
Nathaniel, I'll be honest. Um...

15:51.200 --> 15:53.035
Being here is...

15:55.204 --> 15:56.664
remarkable.

15:56.664 --> 16:01.126
The feeling you have created
is more than happiness. It's a wholeness.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.630
My heart is whole again.
We're finally together.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.633
And I'm not about to give that up.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.182
At least they don't seem to be
in any pain.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.976
We have no way of knowing.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.478
Beneath those
blank expressions may lurk...

16:19.478 --> 16:23.899
- An endless chasm of sheer terror?
- Or void. Utter nothingness.

16:23.899 --> 16:24.942
Oh.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.695
This is just an allergic reaction
or something, right?

16:27.695 --> 16:30.155
Look at them.
They're completely unresponsive.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.492
Apparently, all of them had complained
of stiff necks.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.078
Before they, you know, switched off.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.579
This is very concerning.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.915
- Dr. Curtain needs to be told.
- Dr. Curtain needs to be told.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.209
Because a handful of people
have fallen ill?

16:42.209 --> 16:46.296
Dr. Curtain is a busy man.
We cannot intrude upon his mindscape.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.008
There could be a million
medical explanations for this.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.885
That's what you keep saying,
but in my medical opinion--

16:51.885 --> 16:55.431
I need to find a new doctor
for this lucrative assignment?

16:56.390 --> 16:57.474
No, sir.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.859
We won't be transmitting anything.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.445
I'm just going to run a few tests
and see what's going on

17:09.445 --> 17:11.488
in that little head of yours.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.949
And please don't try anything stupid.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.287
You make terrible mercenaries.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.539
Your disguises are laughable.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.209
- We were underfunded.
- Speaking of which.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.755
Again, I have to transfer
between my accounts,

17:27.755 --> 17:29.715
and that takes a day or two.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.635
Well, my bank does same-day transfers
to anywhere in Europe.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.054
Maybe there is no bank.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.388
You'll get your money.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.599
Do you need a loan?

17:39.808 --> 17:42.978
Any financial stress,
of which there is none,

17:42.978 --> 17:45.397
is more than worth the freedom I have now.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.776
Being out from under that man's
oppressive thumb is priceless.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.906
And we're ready.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.745
<i>Hello, Constance.</i>

17:59.745 --> 18:01.830
<i>It's so nice to have you back.</i>

18:05.167 --> 18:07.711
All I see is mud. A lot of it.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.590
So, let me ask.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.343
Who's idea was it
to travel to Europe by yourselves

18:14.343 --> 18:18.055
to follow a scavenger hunt that might
lead you to your kidnapped friends?

18:19.348 --> 18:20.557
We all wanted to do it.

18:20.557 --> 18:25.395
Yeah, well, you'll see how far
solidarity gets you in the real world.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.190
All right, let's move.
The next crossing isn't very far.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.359
But we still haven't covered
the whole area.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.277
We've covered enough, comrade.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.613
- Time is of the essence.
- She's right.

18:34.613 --> 18:38.033
The likelihood of finding a missing person
lowers significantly

18:38.033 --> 18:39.368
with each passing hour.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.537
Sticky, you can't think that way.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.455
I'm just telling you a fact.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.749
Instead of speculating
on worst-case scenarios,

18:45.749 --> 18:48.377
focus on locating
and retrieving the asset.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.130
-"The asset"?
- Yes, the asset.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.756
It's Constance we're talking about.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.967
I'm trying to remove emotion
from the operation.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.386
It's tactical, improves decision-making.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.847
I guess that's a good point.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.098
Wait a minute.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.059
Over here, look.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.313
Shoe prints.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.482
This is where
they must have gotten off.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.067
The treads are from sneakers

19:12.067 --> 19:14.653
like the ones the water polo players
were wearing.

19:15.571 --> 19:20.159
And they lead to tire tracks.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.913
This is where they must have loaded her
into the car.

19:24.913 --> 19:29.543
The right tire has four grooves in it,
but the left only has three.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.087
Two different back tires.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.881
That's awful maintenance.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.382
ONE TRAIN CAN HIDE ANOTHER

19:35.382 --> 19:37.426
You never just switch out one tire

19:37.426 --> 19:39.178
- unless there's very low wear out--
- That's it!

19:39.178 --> 19:40.429
We're searching for a vehicle

19:40.429 --> 19:42.472
with a rear right tire
that's different than the others.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.684
And the wheels and fenders
will be splattered with mud.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.477
I guess that's a start.

19:47.477 --> 19:50.689
They probably left muddy tire tracks
all along the road, too.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.649
We'll follow them
for as long as they last,

19:52.774 --> 19:55.194
then keep our eyes out
for the matching car.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.904
Approved.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.785
What bureau did you say you were from?

20:03.785 --> 20:07.956
Le Bureau Internationale of Weights
and Measures Scientifique.

20:07.956 --> 20:12.127
You recently sold a customer
some Trentonium-99?

20:12.127 --> 20:13.670
- A kilo, yes?
- Yes.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.340
I remember the sale. Rare element.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.636
Unfortunately, the product failed to meet
international standards.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.429
- What?
- Purity issues.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.765
Or impurity issues, if you like.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.309
No, no, no. We are meticulous about this.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.062
Purity is everything in this business. Everything.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.773
The sales receipt, please.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.277
I must fire my chemist.
He just had a baby. He's distracted.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.279
Oh, there's no need to fire anyone.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.323
Oh, no, no, no. In fact,
it is the only way to make this right.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.033
Ah, you misunderstand.

20:43.033 --> 20:47.955
I believe it's the customer
who is filing a fraudulent complaint.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.248
Ah.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.375
Still, I'll fire the chemist.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.169
He should learn to be more vigilant.
If only for the sake of the child.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.129
No one needs to be fired though.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.048
Here.

21:00.676 --> 21:04.054
- Undoubtedly.
- Bring this customer to justice.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.597
Hm.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.600
He can run, but he can't hide.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.021
<i>I've been waiting
to meet you again, Constance.</i>

21:13.647 --> 21:16.191
Waiting where? In your machine grave?

21:16.900 --> 21:19.027
I have already destroyed you once.

21:19.778 --> 21:24.116
<i>You say "fail." I hear "try again."</i>

21:25.284 --> 21:26.952
<i>What is your favorite color?</i>

21:29.121 --> 21:31.331
Go ahead. Don't hold back.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.293
I absolutely love magenta.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.676
You will say "no"
exactly as you did before.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.762
You will get angry.
You will throw it into a death spiral.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.890
I need to see how you destroy it.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.479
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

21:55.939 --> 21:57.774
<i>What is your favorite color?</i>

22:03.864 --> 22:05.532
<i>You say "fail."</i>

22:05.532 --> 22:10.037
<i>- I hear...</i>
- There. Destroyed.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.755
So, you want your brain swept.
Is that what you want?

22:19.755 --> 22:21.381
I would not mind.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.886
I suppose we'll have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.691
- Kinda hard to see the tire treads.
- I can see them perfectly.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.699
There! That blue one. Stop.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.582
- Look at those wheels.
- Caked with mud.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.794
The two rear tires are the same make.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.423
I'm sorry, but it's not the car.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.219
We all need to be realistic about this.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.555
We're looking for a needle
in the proverbial haystack.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.224
Then we'll keep looking.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.351
Until we proverbially find her.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.770
Kate, she makes a good point.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.440
Maybe it's time to find a police station.
Accept our defeat.

23:23.735 --> 23:24.694
You guys.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.656
Someone turned onto this road.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.076
Can you see the grooves
in the tread patterns?

23:31.076 --> 23:32.786
Two different tires.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.746
It's the car.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.665
Let's move.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.044
Using your mind's eye, tell me.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.630
What is on the other side of this card?

23:46.675 --> 23:48.927
I see the depression of middle age.

23:49.719 --> 23:52.180
I am running out of patience.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.765
What do you see?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.436
Take your time.

23:58.520 --> 24:04.443
I see a broken person who's angry.
She lives in a root cellar.

24:04.443 --> 24:10.198
Insulting me isn't going to help you,
you female child.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.702
Try this one.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.120
As a child...

24:15.912 --> 24:18.290
is this how you pictured your future self?

24:18.915 --> 24:21.418
Holed up? Below ground?

24:21.418 --> 24:24.379
Read the card.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.132
Life could be better, couldn't it?

24:27.132 --> 24:30.886
My life is fine. Inches from victory.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.055
Maybe I don't understand the word,

24:34.055 --> 24:38.435
but does "fine"
mean "friendless and alone"?

24:38.435 --> 24:40.604
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.439
"Professionally disgraced"?

24:42.439 --> 24:43.815
I said stop!

24:47.194 --> 24:49.362
Are you sure they went this way?

24:49.362 --> 24:51.072
There. That car.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.243
Hang on.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.761
Mud? Different tires?

25:12.761 --> 25:14.638
This must be the car.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.933
Why would they park here
in the middle of nowhere?

25:17.933 --> 25:19.726
Maybe they switched vehicles.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.437
Cliché but effective.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.484
Or this was
their destination all along.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.569
Check it out.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.031
Camouflage?

25:33.031 --> 25:34.115
Exactly.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.706
Looks like an old root cellar.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.585
It's locked, but...

25:46.962 --> 25:48.255
nothing I can't get past.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.093
Kate, pick the lock.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.646
The children are due in two hours.

26:04.646 --> 26:07.023
Enough time to book some rooms,
arrange for a car,

26:07.023 --> 26:09.317
and be back at the station
in time for their arrival.

26:09.317 --> 26:13.613
Ms. Perumal,
I believe I underestimated you.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.282
You wouldn't be the first.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.368
And please, call me Dipika.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.703
Dipika.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.878
It's not enough that he has a compound
full of giddy followers

26:28.878 --> 26:30.422
worshipping his every word.

26:30.422 --> 26:34.718
He won't stop until every person
on the planet is under his control.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.804
- Are you even listening to me?
- Yes, of course.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.473
I have heard everything
you've been saying.

26:40.473 --> 26:43.727
- Oh, dear.
- What? Oh, the clothes?

26:43.727 --> 26:45.312
They're comfortable, that's all.

26:45.312 --> 26:49.232
You have to feel the fabric.
Go ahead. Feel it.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.152
It's soft.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.029
And breathable.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.073
The waistband is so much more forgiving
than those tight trousers.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.034
Ooh.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.994
Listen, now's the time to make our move.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.704
I have a plan to get us out of here.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.498
Well, I'm sure your plan is brilliant,
Number Two. They almost always are.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.500
But now is not the time
to leave my brother.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.461
You saw him out there.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.088
I have finally earned his trust.
I have his ear.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.090
Don't underestimate the value of that.

27:14.090 --> 27:17.552
First of all, you will never turn him.

27:17.552 --> 27:20.472
Second,
you don't have to leave your brother.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.807
He's coming with us.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.102
No. He'll never agree to that.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.729
He won't have to want to.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.482
- We're gonna kidnap him.
- What?

27:30.482 --> 27:33.777
It is the only way
to destroy his operation.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.112
By removing Curtain from his followers,

27:36.112 --> 27:40.575
it will be like chopping the head
off a snake or a mountain tapir.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.077
That's very specific.

27:42.077 --> 27:46.623
The animal will flail,
twitching in paroxysms of death.

27:46.623 --> 27:50.210
Blood draining
from its still beating heart

27:50.794 --> 27:54.589
- until, at last, it stops.
- Please stop.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.967
The good news is,
you two will be together through it all.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.637
- Side by side.
- Well, that part I like.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.497
Constance?

28:31.918 --> 28:35.922
No more excuses. It's your life.
Take responsibility for it.

28:35.922 --> 28:39.592
- I've tried.
- Trying is not good enough.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.553
Constance!

28:46.891 --> 28:49.477
- Are you okay?
- Did she hurt you?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.021
She's the one who's hurting.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.648
I am perfectly fine.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.527
The humid air down here,
it's terrible for my allergies.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.362
Come on. We're getting you out of here.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.700
No one is going anywhere.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.909
Restrain them.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.998
It's time to boot up the Brainsweeper.
