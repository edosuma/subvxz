00:01.175 --> 00:03.699
Previously
on "Gotham Knights"...

00:03.699 --> 00:05.527
Beware the Court of Owls...

00:05.527 --> 00:07.442
3 days before
he was murdered, Bruce Wayne

00:07.442 --> 00:08.834
made an appointment to alter
his last will and testament.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.532
that watches
all the time.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.968
They think
I killed my dad

00:11.968 --> 00:13.665
because I wanted
his money?

00:13.665 --> 00:15.928
The night he was killed,
this was found on your father.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.105
Ruling Gotham
from a shadowed perch...

00:19.454 --> 00:21.891
behind granite and lime.

00:21.891 --> 00:25.373
Court of Owls were
hunting the Wayne family
for over 100 years,

00:25.373 --> 00:27.549
starting with his
great-great-grandfather
Alan Wayne.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.377
Maybe looking through
his cold case

00:29.377 --> 00:31.118
will help us prove
they killed my dad.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.729
They watch you
at your hearth.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.644
Every scrap
of paper the GCPD has
on Alan Wayne's death--

00:35.644 --> 00:37.385
autopsy reports,
eyewitness statements,
all of it.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.343
They watch you
in your bed.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.389
The Court killed my dad,

00:41.389 --> 00:43.130
and now they're
trying to kill me.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.610
Speak not
a whispered word of them

00:45.610 --> 00:48.091
or they'll send the Talon
for your head.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.183
Oh, God.

00:57.709 --> 01:00.364
Please.
Please. They're everywhere.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.279
Please. They're coming
for all of us.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.326
Aah!

01:07.545 --> 01:08.677
Ah!

01:08.677 --> 01:09.765
Sir.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.419
Sir, calm down.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.464
Can't you see 'em?
They're over there.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.205
See what?
Nothing there.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.687
Hey! Get down!

01:20.471 --> 01:22.560
Put the gun down.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.521
It's OK.

01:26.521 --> 01:29.306
It's too late.
They're already here.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.504
♪ Do you wanna,
do you wanna ♪

01:53.504 --> 01:57.117
♪ Do you wanna
get into trouble? ♪

02:00.120 --> 02:02.470
♪ Do you wanna, do you wanna ♪

02:02.470 --> 02:05.908
♪ Do you wanna
get into trouble? ♪

02:07.344 --> 02:09.564
Liberated this
from the teachers' lounge.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.873
"Congratulations Cathy."

02:14.873 --> 02:16.310
Hey. I'm sorry.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.833
I couldn't find one
that said,

02:17.833 --> 02:19.400
"Good luck trying to
solve Bruce Wayne's murder

02:19.400 --> 02:20.966
"by investigating
the alleged killing

02:20.966 --> 02:22.490
of his
great-great-grandfather."

02:24.056 --> 02:26.972
Slice, anyone?
Slice? No?

02:26.972 --> 02:28.235
All right.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.589
Uh, you do realize

02:34.589 --> 02:36.678
the Talon almost
killed you with
that thing, right?

02:36.678 --> 02:38.810
Yeah. Now I'm repurposing
it for good, so...

02:38.810 --> 02:40.682
OK.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.858
I've been through this
hundred-year-old police report

02:42.858 --> 02:45.556
a thousand times, and there's
nothing in here that

02:45.556 --> 02:48.516
even remotely
suggests Alan Wayne
could've been murdered.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.995
All it does is confirm

02:49.995 --> 02:51.997
what the newspapers
already reported.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.608
"The renowned
architect died by
accidental drowning

02:53.608 --> 02:55.262
"upon falling
into a sewer

02:55.262 --> 02:57.089
following a sudden
bout of dementia."

02:57.089 --> 02:59.396
Beep beep!
Coming through.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.095
You find
anything interesting?

03:03.095 --> 03:07.187
Maybe.
Maybe it's nothing.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.364
See those marks on
Alan Wayne's body?

03:11.756 --> 03:13.367
It's weird, right?

03:13.367 --> 03:15.195
Yeah. They mentioned
those cuts in the report,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.588
but they said that it
had nothing to do with
the cause of death.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.678
Yeah, I'm--I'm not
a medical examiner,

03:20.678 --> 03:22.941
but I'm pretty sure
falling down a sewer

03:22.941 --> 03:24.856
doesn't cause
marks like that.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.858
But these marks
don't prove anything,

03:26.858 --> 03:28.947
and if Alan Wayne's death
was an accident,

03:28.947 --> 03:31.907
it means he wasn't killed
by the Court of Owls.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.997
Which means
this can't help us

03:34.997 --> 03:37.042
solve my dad's murder
or clear our names,

03:37.042 --> 03:39.306
so this is
all a dead end.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.264
You seem tired.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.484
I am tired.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.793
I'm tired of living
in a stupid belfry.

03:48.793 --> 03:52.406
I'm tired of showering
in a dirty locker room.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.408
I'm tired of worrying
about whether I'm gonna

03:54.408 --> 03:57.149
end up dead
or in prison...

03:57.149 --> 03:59.674
and I'm tired of losing
everybody that ever
gave a damn about me.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.937
And I'm tired of
your constant bitching.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.810
I just wanna go home.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.726
I want my life back.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.078
I found something.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.515
Hold onto
your asses, guys,

04:14.515 --> 04:17.474
because this is gonna
change the game. Yes...

04:17.474 --> 04:20.129
Ladies and gentlemen...

04:20.129 --> 04:22.392
Bat-Brat was a member

04:22.392 --> 04:24.220
of the Never Get Laid Brigade.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.442
No, no.
Let me see that.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.228
So embarrassing.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.232
Guys?

04:36.232 --> 04:37.451
What?

04:42.194 --> 04:43.979
Gotham is
once again in mourning

04:43.979 --> 04:46.242
as Mayor Hamilton Hill
is laid to rest

04:46.242 --> 04:47.939
after his shocking murder.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.680
For a city that seems to be
running out of heroes,

04:49.680 --> 04:51.639
it hasn't forgotten
DA Harvey Dent's

04:51.639 --> 04:53.641
heroic takedown
of the Mutant Gang

04:53.641 --> 04:55.686
during the terrifying
hostage situation

04:55.686 --> 04:57.209
of the Founders' Gala.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.342
Dent remains
the frontrunner in the race

04:59.342 --> 05:00.952
to elect Gotham's new mayor.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.606
However, a new candidate

05:02.606 --> 05:04.216
has thrown his hat in the ring--

05:04.216 --> 05:06.044
industrialist Lincoln March.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.872
Well, if Harvey Dent

05:07.872 --> 05:09.526
is as committed
to fixing this city

05:09.526 --> 05:11.136
as he claims to be,

05:11.136 --> 05:12.660
then why has he allowed

05:12.660 --> 05:14.792
Bruce Wayne's killers
to remain at large?

05:14.792 --> 05:17.055
Now, is that really
what Gotham City needs?

05:17.055 --> 05:19.841
Just another
two-faced politician?

05:28.328 --> 05:31.940
Ohh. Ahh.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.595
There you are.
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.162
Ahh. Thank you.

05:37.162 --> 05:40.905
Same clothes as yesterday.
Interesting night?

05:43.081 --> 05:45.214
You may want to freshen up
before you head
to the briefing.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.824
What time is that?

05:46.824 --> 05:48.652
5 minutes ago.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.012
What is it?

06:02.318 --> 06:03.711
It's not my key.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.887
Guess you did have
an interesting night.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.192
Stop it.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.672
And now you're
6 minutes late.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.718
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.508
Well, if you're looking
for a connection between

06:18.508 --> 06:20.380
the Court of Owls
and Alan Wayne's death,

06:20.380 --> 06:23.731
I think X marks the spot.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.255
Oh, Little
Miss Wire Cutter's
got jokes.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.779
Should get you
an open mic night at
the Iceberg Lounge.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.390
Hopefully,
you won't bomb.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.044
A lot of words
to say thank you.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.223
Maybe this is
some signature weapon

06:38.223 --> 06:41.531
that's been passed
from assassin
to assassin for decades,

06:41.531 --> 06:43.925
and if it was used
on us and Alan Wayne,

06:43.925 --> 06:45.579
then maybe it was
used on others?

06:45.579 --> 06:47.276
Is that crazy?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.060
In his journals,
my dad said that he
suspected the Court

06:49.060 --> 06:51.454
had been responsible
for decades worth
of murders.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.848
I kinda wonder
if there are more
accidentally dead bodies

06:53.848 --> 06:55.545
with strange scars
out there.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.504
We'd have to access

06:57.504 --> 07:00.768
all of the GCPD
autopsy records to find out.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.951
It's gonna take me
a lot of trips.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.561
No.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.608
Just one.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.393
It's called
a rubber ducky.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.960
It'll give us
remote access.

07:18.960 --> 07:23.094
A little juice of
the bean for the sarge.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.967
You're learning, rook.
What can I do you for?

07:25.967 --> 07:28.448
Just returning this
to Records.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.058
Well, get to it, son.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.148
Uh!

07:35.280 --> 07:37.152
Mr. Dent.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.938
Harvey's there?

07:42.157 --> 07:43.985
I--I'm so sorry.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.206
Me and the boys
appreciate everything

07:48.206 --> 07:49.860
that you're doing
for the city.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.471
You've got my vote.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.690
You all stay safe
out there.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.171
We'll try.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.613
Stephanie on radio: Nice save.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.050
Heading
to the server room.

08:08.836 --> 08:11.142
Which is more like
a server closet.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.970
OK,
pop the rubber ducky
into the main server.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.798
The program
will self-initiate download.

08:30.684 --> 08:33.164
Got remote access.
We're in.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.644
And I'm out.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.691
OK. Searching for...

08:37.691 --> 08:40.781
accidental deaths or suicides.

08:40.781 --> 08:45.568
Cross-referencing
with anomalous cross-like scars.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.743
This may
take a minute.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.703
Or not.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.009
Whoa.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.708
Looks like Dad was right.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.361
These cases span decades

08:56.361 --> 08:57.928
and multiple jurisdictions.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.887
Which is why nobody
noticed the pattern
until now.

08:59.887 --> 09:03.717
So, the Court has been
killing people
for over 100 years,

09:03.717 --> 09:05.762
making them look like
accidents or suicides?

09:05.762 --> 09:08.460
This is gonna take us
days to go through.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.550
Well, when was
the last body found?

09:12.247 --> 09:13.857
Two weeks ago.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.599
You're kidding.
That's the same day
I was arrested.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.123
A lawyer shot himself
in Robinson Park.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.908
"Witnesses say
he was suffering

09:20.908 --> 09:22.257
"from paranoid delusions

09:22.257 --> 09:24.346
or some form
of psychotic break."

09:24.346 --> 09:25.782
Sound familiar?

09:25.782 --> 09:29.220
Yeah. So does the name.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.222
Pericles Jones.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.007
He was one of
my dad's lawyers,

09:33.007 --> 09:34.922
one of the ones
he trusted the most.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.359
Why would the Court
target him?

09:37.359 --> 09:39.143
Maybe he knew too much.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.582
Which means we gotta
find out what he knew.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.806
You want to break
into that lawyer's house?

09:49.806 --> 09:51.155
Yeah. You think
you can give me

09:51.155 --> 09:52.679
a crash course
in lock picking?

09:52.679 --> 09:54.332
Ooh, look at you,
thinking like

09:54.332 --> 09:55.986
a criminal.
It's so cute.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.509
What do you think
you're gonna find?

09:57.509 --> 09:59.294
Maybe nothing.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.948
Maybe something
that'll point us
toward the Court

10:00.948 --> 10:02.645
and why they
wanted him dead.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.126
Anyway, gotta
follow all leads.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.477
I'm coming with you.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.479
I've gotten you in
enough trouble already.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.176
Maybe see what you
can find out about

10:12.176 --> 10:14.178
our mystery knife--
where it came from?

10:15.397 --> 10:17.312
I can stay and do that.

10:19.096 --> 10:22.970
In that case,
I'm team breaking
and entering.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.363
Easier for me to
pick the lock than
teach you how.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.935
I'll help you
with that knife.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.502
Where do we start?

10:33.502 --> 10:36.636
By asking an expert
in the sharp and pointy.

10:45.993 --> 10:49.039
Ohh. Rich people can always
afford the toughest locks.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.781
Be glad I came along
instead of your girlfriend.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.304
She's not
my girlfriend.

10:53.304 --> 10:57.221
Hmm. You have better
taste than I thought.

10:57.221 --> 11:00.137
OK, what is it you have
against Stephanie?

11:00.137 --> 11:02.009
She's risking a lot
to help us.

11:02.009 --> 11:05.360
Your not-girlfriend
just about got me killed

11:05.360 --> 11:08.015
while she was busy
cosplaying rebel.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.626
You sure
that's the reason?

11:10.626 --> 11:12.367
What are you,
my therapist?

11:12.367 --> 11:15.283
Look, it just seems like
you two are a lot alike.

11:15.283 --> 11:18.460
You're both literal geniuses,

11:18.460 --> 11:19.896
incredibly stubborn.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.332
And if I just had
a celebrity dad

11:21.332 --> 11:22.986
and a multimillion-dollar
trust fund,

11:22.986 --> 11:25.336
we could be twinsies.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.787
Another yearbook?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.266
Hmm. Guess you
could say that.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.399
A yearbook for
serial killers.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.618
Superlatives include

11:46.618 --> 11:49.709
best strangling technique...

11:49.709 --> 11:53.277
most limbs
hacked off.
And that's not all.

11:53.277 --> 11:56.237
Let me see. Oh.
Felix Harmon.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.152
He was a famous
knife thrower

11:58.152 --> 12:00.284
in Haly's Circus
in the early 1900s.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.286
You know, where they--
they spin the woman
upside down

12:02.286 --> 12:04.898
and then they
throw knives blindfolded
and try not to hit her.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.856
Well, Felix was the best.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.250
Never stabbed a woman.
Not once.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.862
Well, at least not
during work hours.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.082
You see, Felix
was also known as

12:15.082 --> 12:17.258
the Butcher of Gotham,

12:17.258 --> 12:18.825
a serial killer,
who terrorized

12:18.825 --> 12:20.435
the gaslit streets
of Gotham

12:20.435 --> 12:23.743
by dismembering
his victims
bit by bit,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.048
right down
to cutting out

12:25.048 --> 12:27.529
their little,
pink tongues.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.487
Guess you could say
his weapon of choice

12:29.487 --> 12:32.447
allowed him to mix
business with pleasure.

12:32.447 --> 12:35.102
Those look exactly
like the knives
the Talon used.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.581
Yes. Thank you.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.061
See, I knew I'd seen
this knife before,

12:38.061 --> 12:39.367
and then
I remembered where.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.761
My dad told me
about this book.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.675
Pretty sure he just
wanted me to read
the parts about him,

12:43.675 --> 12:47.027
but, uh,
I was always drawn
to dear old Felix.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.593
So, what happened
to dear old Felix?

12:48.593 --> 12:53.294
Oh. Caught and executed
in the city square.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.296
Always did
love an audience.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.428
OK, so,
how did the Talon

12:57.428 --> 12:59.909
get ahold of knives
belonging to a serial killer

12:59.909 --> 13:01.998
who's been dead
for almost 100 years?

13:03.347 --> 13:06.133
This says Felix Harmon
had a daughter.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.788
Hmm. She must be part
Galapagos turtle,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.920
because she is
still alive.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.054
Goes by
Eunice Monroe now.

13:14.054 --> 13:16.578
Wait. She changed Harmon
but stuck with Eunice?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.320
Yup. Currently resides at

13:19.320 --> 13:21.452
the Robinson Park
Nursing Home.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.411
Hmm.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.935
Well. I wonder
if the old biddy knows

13:25.935 --> 13:27.632
how Daddy's cutlery
made it

13:27.632 --> 13:29.460
into the hands of
the Talon.

13:42.604 --> 13:45.389
Looks like someone
had a similar idea.

13:45.389 --> 13:49.785
I think we were
planning on being
a little more subtle.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.483
Turn around slowly,

13:52.483 --> 13:55.312
or I'll paint the walls
with your insides.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.930
Wait.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.715
You're Bruce Wayne's kid.

14:06.715 --> 14:10.110
What the hell are you
doing in my father's house?

14:10.110 --> 14:13.591
Looking for answers.
You gotta believe me.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.682
I don't think your dad
chose to kill himself.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.554
No kidding.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.164
Suddenly goes insane?

14:21.164 --> 14:23.210
Trashes this place?

14:23.210 --> 14:25.168
Your dad did this?

14:25.168 --> 14:26.909
Right before somebody
made him want

14:26.909 --> 14:28.955
to blow his brains out
in broad daylight.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.739
I think whoever
killed my father

14:30.739 --> 14:32.915
was responsible for
your dad's death, too.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.134
And who would that be?

14:34.134 --> 14:36.484
The Court of Owls.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.401
So, you know
about them?

14:42.011 --> 14:43.230
No.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.065
Clearly, my dad did.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.960
Evening, Commissioner.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.483
Anything new on
the mayor's death?

15:19.483 --> 15:21.703
Well, the "Gazette"
has a source who says

15:21.703 --> 15:23.923
the bomb found
in Mayor Hill's limo,

15:23.923 --> 15:27.274
same type the Mutants
threatened to set off
at the gala.

15:27.274 --> 15:28.928
So, what's your
best guess here?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
Mutant Gang could've
used the gala

15:30.930 --> 15:33.410
as a distraction
to plant a bomb
in the mayor's car.

15:34.977 --> 15:38.111
And why do you not
look convinced?

15:38.111 --> 15:40.156
Close the door.

15:43.464 --> 15:46.119
They found this
in the mayor's limo.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.909
It's the same type of coin
that was found
on Bruce Wayne's body.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.128
Hmm.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.609
You think the murders
are connected?

15:58.609 --> 16:01.699
Could be. Could be
the Mutant Gang

16:01.699 --> 16:03.353
trying to copycat.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.834
What do you know about
the Court of Owls?

16:05.834 --> 16:07.618
Should I check
under my bed

16:07.618 --> 16:09.620
for monsters before
I answer that?

16:09.620 --> 16:11.971
Come on. I'm serious.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.321
It's an old-timey
nursery rhyme.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.149
Don't hear it
much anymore.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.455
Every once in a while,
some perp

16:18.455 --> 16:21.589
will try to use it
as a catch-all excuse.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.721
"Wasn't me.
The Court of Owls
did it."

16:23.721 --> 16:25.419
Yeah, but how many of them

16:25.419 --> 16:27.377
leave coins
like these behind?

16:27.377 --> 16:29.031
Do you have
any idea why the Court

16:29.031 --> 16:31.599
would want to kill your dad?

16:31.599 --> 16:33.427
Can't help but think
that it has

16:33.427 --> 16:35.124
something to do
with the fact that
two days before

16:35.124 --> 16:37.561
Bruce Wayne
was murdered,

16:37.561 --> 16:39.259
he came here...

16:39.259 --> 16:41.174
to meet with
my dad in secret.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.177
Do you know what for?

16:44.177 --> 16:46.135
To change his will.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.703
They worked on it
all day.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.358
The police told me
he was planning
on changing his will,

16:51.358 --> 16:53.273
but he died
before he could.

16:53.273 --> 16:56.450
That's not true.
My dad tried to tell
that to the police,

16:56.450 --> 16:58.060
even called
the lead detective.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.149
Ford?

17:00.149 --> 17:02.195
Yeah. That's the guy.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.371
My dad told him
that it wasn't true

17:04.371 --> 17:06.025
that your father
was planning

17:06.025 --> 17:08.070
to cut you out
of his will.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.377
Then hours later,
my dad starts
acting crazy,

17:10.377 --> 17:12.683
ranting, raving,
tearing the place apart.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.381
And not long after--

17:15.556 --> 17:17.210
he was dead.

17:19.951 --> 17:22.302
Do you know what changes
they did make to the will?

17:22.302 --> 17:26.567
No. Your father took
the only copy.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.873
But as he was leaving,
I heard my dad tell him

17:28.873 --> 17:30.571
that what
he was doing

17:30.571 --> 17:32.225
was gonna
change everything,

17:32.225 --> 17:33.748
and that he was
about to become

17:33.748 --> 17:36.055
the greatest man in
the history of Gotham.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.016
I think whatever
was in that will

17:41.016 --> 17:42.800
got both
our fathers killed.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.031
Their entire argument
is that my dad

17:56.031 --> 17:57.902
was gonna cut me
out of his will,

17:57.902 --> 18:00.601
which, apparently,
is why I hired
you guys to kill him.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.603
But if we can get
our hands
on that will,

18:02.603 --> 18:04.866
it'll prove he
didn't cut me out.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.086
Then there's no motive.
Their case against us
starts to fall apart.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.261
There must be a copy
of it somewhere.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.653
There's only the original,

18:09.653 --> 18:11.264
and, apparently, my dad
took that with him.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.961
Well, what would
he do with it?

18:12.961 --> 18:16.007
I don't know, but I do
know someone who might.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.531
Cressida.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.620
She was my dad's attaché.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.449
What makes you think she's
not gonna call the cops?

18:22.449 --> 18:25.800
She's the closest thing
to family I have left.

18:27.323 --> 18:30.152
When I was 12, my dad
was away on business,

18:30.152 --> 18:32.981
and I thought it
would be a good idea

18:32.981 --> 18:36.463
to take out his favorite
vintage car for a joyride.

18:36.463 --> 18:41.250
It wasn't.
Banged it up pretty good,

18:41.250 --> 18:43.165
and I knew
I'd be dead meat,

18:43.165 --> 18:46.864
but when my dad got home,
instead of telling him
what really happened,

18:46.864 --> 18:49.215
Cressida took the blame.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.217
I'll never forget that.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.957
She's always
looked out for me.

18:52.957 --> 18:56.483
Still, it's a risk.

18:56.483 --> 18:59.312
I know, which is
why I'm going alone.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.751
Are we any closer
to figuring out
how the Talon ended up

19:03.751 --> 19:06.710
with knives belonging to
a long-dead serial killer?

19:06.710 --> 19:08.669
That is what
I'm going to ask

19:08.669 --> 19:10.888
Felix Harmon's
daughter.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.630
Nursing home
visiting hours start
in about 15 minutes.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.806
And I'm going
with her.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.330
Nice wig.

19:18.635 --> 19:21.247
What? You know,
Eunice and I

19:21.247 --> 19:23.162
happen to have
a lot in common, OK?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.946
Both daughters
of serial killers.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.513
I'm sure we're
gonna have a lot
to talk about.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.515
I'll be doing
all the talking.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.175
Thank you.

19:40.091 --> 19:43.617
Hi. We're here to see
Eunice Monroe.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.620
We're from Gotham Academy
doing community service.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.970
You know, reading
to old people.

19:51.581 --> 19:54.062
Sign in.
Down the hall,

19:54.062 --> 19:55.716
second door
to the right.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.196
Thanks.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.680
Harvey.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.899
Lincoln.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.727
Do you have a minute?
I need to talk to you.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.381
What is it?
Your internal polling

20:08.381 --> 20:09.817
come back less
than you'd hoped?

20:09.817 --> 20:12.385
This isn't about
the election.

20:12.385 --> 20:15.475
I, uh...
I need your help.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.259
What is it?

20:17.259 --> 20:19.609
Is it true
that Bruce Wayne
and Mayor Hill

20:19.609 --> 20:22.046
both received
antique coins before
they were killed?

20:22.743 --> 20:24.092
Where'd you hear that?

20:24.092 --> 20:27.226
You're not the only one with
an in at the GCPD, Harvey.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.184
I can't discuss
an ongoing case.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.490
You know that.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.101
Look, I'm not
asking for the gossip.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.408
I'm asking because...

20:38.193 --> 20:39.890
because I
got one, too.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.199
I just need to know.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.940
Am I in danger?

20:58.561 --> 20:59.562
Mrs. Monroe?

20:59.562 --> 21:02.391
It's, uh, Miss Monroe.
Heh heh heh.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.914
I never married.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.265
But, please,
call me Eunice.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.790
We're doing a project
for school,

21:09.790 --> 21:11.531
and we were hoping
you could tell us

21:11.531 --> 21:13.881
what it was like
growing up in old Gotham.

21:13.881 --> 21:17.014
Heh. Oh, there's
so much to tell.

21:22.890 --> 21:26.720
You must have so many
interesting stories.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.765
Oh, honestly,

21:28.765 --> 21:31.420
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.944
Uh, well, we could start
with what it was like

21:33.944 --> 21:35.859
having your pops be
the Butcher of Gotham.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.644
You know, we don't
have a lot of time here,

21:37.644 --> 21:40.777
and, frankly, I don't
think she does, either, so--

21:40.777 --> 21:43.389
We're not supposed
to talk about that.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.348
It's a secret.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.917
Well, we love secrets.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.050
And we know
just how to keep them.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.490
What do you want
to know about Papa?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.499
Here's what I don't get.

22:06.499 --> 22:10.851
All of the Talon's
victims had sudden bouts
of dementia or insanity

22:10.851 --> 22:12.461
with no prior history
just before they died.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.289
So either being
attacked by the Talon

22:14.289 --> 22:17.074
is so scary
that it literally
drives you wackadoo--

22:17.074 --> 22:19.729
I'm not gonna lie. He is
a big ol' pile of scary.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.601
Or...

22:21.601 --> 22:25.387
the Talon's knives
are laced with
some kind of toxin,

22:25.387 --> 22:27.171
a hallucinogenic maybe.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.522
None of the cuts
were deep enough
to kill,

22:29.522 --> 22:32.351
but maybe he dipped
them in something

22:32.351 --> 22:34.309
that made
his victims
lose their minds.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.963
I buy it.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.533
It--my dad's an alcoholic.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.796
When he drank, he just
became a different person.

22:42.796 --> 22:46.756
I mean, he wasn't great
to begin with, but...

22:46.756 --> 22:50.107
add alcohol
and he was screaming
and smashing everything.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.109
But when he sobered up--

22:52.109 --> 22:53.720
All apologetic,

22:53.720 --> 22:56.592
promises it'll
never happen again,

22:56.592 --> 22:58.942
buys you stuff
to make up for it.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.036
You know,
we should check
if the autopsies showed

23:06.036 --> 23:08.735
any strange
chemicals or drugs
in their systems.

23:14.262 --> 23:17.134
As a child, my father
was always traveling

23:17.134 --> 23:18.919
with the circus.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.224
Ohh.

23:20.224 --> 23:25.839
I loved the beautiful
costumes, the spectacle,

23:25.839 --> 23:28.494
but I especially
loved the music.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.583
Heh. I so rarely saw Papa,

23:30.583 --> 23:33.412
but he knows how much
I loved the music.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.632
He never forgets.

23:36.632 --> 23:40.288
And even though he was
traveling with his act,

23:40.288 --> 23:42.856
he managed to watch over me.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.379
Hmm.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.076
He still does.

23:46.076 --> 23:50.733
And he sends me
these music boxes

23:50.733 --> 23:53.257
to add to my collection.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.476
Sends?

23:54.476 --> 23:55.912
Yes.

23:55.912 --> 23:58.959
This one's my favorite.

23:58.959 --> 24:02.223
Of course, I always
like the newest ones best.

24:03.746 --> 24:07.010
Did your dad give away
other things of his?

24:07.010 --> 24:10.884
Like, I don't know,
say, his knives?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.061
Excuse me?

24:14.061 --> 24:16.585
You know, the ones he--

24:16.585 --> 24:18.631
carved people up with.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.981
I mean, Butcher of Gotham
and all.

24:20.981 --> 24:24.941
'Cause there is
actually somebody
out there right now

24:24.941 --> 24:28.423
doing very bad things
with them.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.991
Such a crude name.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.906
Papa never
butchered anyone

24:32.906 --> 24:35.169
despite what
the papers said.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.391
You...
I'm a little chilly.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.350
Can we get my blanket?

24:42.350 --> 24:44.439
Yes. Of course.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.268
Papa was always
so precise.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.620
He used to dissect his prey

24:51.620 --> 24:54.493
with the skill of
the finest surgeon

24:54.493 --> 24:57.800
in all of Gotham.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.367
Hmm.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.630
Let me tell you
another secret.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.725
Papa didn't cut
their tongues out

25:09.725 --> 25:13.686
to keep the bystanders
from hearing their screams.

25:13.686 --> 25:16.036
That's absurd.

25:16.036 --> 25:19.692
I mean, you can scream
perfectly well
without a tongue.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.610
No. It was
their insipid pleas

25:24.610 --> 25:27.221
to spare their lives
he couldn't tolerate.

25:28.309 --> 25:32.226
His victims got
what they deserved...

25:33.357 --> 25:35.751
just like you.

25:40.147 --> 25:43.150
Papa will be quite
displeased with you

25:43.150 --> 25:46.762
for tricking me into
saying things I shouldn't.

25:46.762 --> 25:50.897
Beware the Court of Owls,

25:50.897 --> 25:53.900
that watches all the time.

25:59.122 --> 26:03.344
Ruling Gotham
from their shadowed perch

26:03.344 --> 26:06.956
behind granite and lime.

26:06.956 --> 26:11.134
They watch you at your hearth.
They watch you at your bed.

26:11.134 --> 26:15.225
Speak not
a whispered word of them,

26:15.225 --> 26:20.317
or they'll send
the Talon for your head!

26:37.378 --> 26:39.293
Turner.

26:40.381 --> 26:41.991
Oh, my God.

26:46.082 --> 26:49.172
Turner, how did you
get in here?

26:49.172 --> 26:52.088
I've been sneaking
in and out of here
since I was 9.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.614
I've missed this place.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.137
Are you all right?

26:57.137 --> 26:59.661
As all right as someone
wanted for murder can be.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.230
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

27:03.230 --> 27:05.014
Why didn't you
come to me sooner?

27:05.014 --> 27:07.147
I didn't want
to drag you into this.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.585
And...

27:10.585 --> 27:12.152
well, I thought maybe

27:12.152 --> 27:14.720
you believed what they
said about me was true.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.418
Turner.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.289
I know you.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.900
You loved your father.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.642
I know you'd never do
anything to hurt him.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.080
Thank you.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.385
For what?

27:28.385 --> 27:30.300
Believing in me.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.825
There's nothing I
wouldn't do for you.

27:32.825 --> 27:35.349
Good, because...

27:35.349 --> 27:36.916
I think I know a way

27:36.916 --> 27:39.222
that you can help me
prove I'm innocent.

27:39.222 --> 27:42.138
Whatever you need.
You're home now.

27:43.923 --> 27:47.448
I'm not seeing any
hallucinogenics coming
from these autopsies,

27:47.448 --> 27:51.495
but a lot of them have
trace amounts of
an unknown substance.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.236
What does that mean?

27:53.236 --> 27:55.543
It means the body metabolized
some kind of drug,

27:55.543 --> 27:58.241
breaking it down, so we
can't know what it is.

27:58.241 --> 28:00.374
Certain drugs, like opiates,
break down really quickly,

28:00.374 --> 28:03.812
so after a while,
they won't even show up
on a drug test.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.776
I watch a lot of true crime.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.475
It's OK. You don't
have to do that.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.346
What?

28:16.346 --> 28:17.870
Make excuses.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.698
I mean, I know
what it's like.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.397
I actually do love
true crime.

28:29.533 --> 28:33.059
And my mom's an addict.

28:34.234 --> 28:36.497
Pills, mostly.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.804
That's why you're working
on this so late with me?

28:38.804 --> 28:40.719
You don't want
to go home?

28:42.155 --> 28:45.114
Not until she's passed out.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.727
Nobody knows...

28:48.727 --> 28:50.380
not even Turner.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.426
I'm not saying anything.

28:52.426 --> 28:57.431
But, you know, if you
ever do need someone to
talk to about anything,

28:57.431 --> 28:59.041
I...

28:59.041 --> 29:02.001
I'm literally not
going anywhere, so...

29:06.005 --> 29:11.793
Checking out
item 4926-81.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.013
OK.

29:20.410 --> 29:23.718
Uh, item 4926-81?

29:23.718 --> 29:25.111
It's an Athenian coin

29:25.111 --> 29:26.590
connected with
the Bruce Wayne case.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.767
Sorry. Do you mean
checking back in?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.029
You already
checked it out.

29:30.029 --> 29:31.508
What do you mean?

29:31.508 --> 29:33.293
Um...

29:33.293 --> 29:35.077
right there.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.036
You already
signed it out.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.344
That doesn't make any sense.

29:41.344 --> 29:44.478
No. I'm telling you,
she had that crazy
old woman strength.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.219
That's not a thing.
Oh, it's a thing.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.698
This can't
be a coincidence.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.700
Eunice Monroe associated
with the Court of Owls?

29:49.700 --> 29:51.311
Mm-hmm. She was
off her rocker, man.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.226
She kept insisting that
her dearly departed daddy

29:53.226 --> 29:54.836
was still sending her
little presents.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.533
So the Court is having
someone bring her trinkets

29:56.533 --> 29:57.926
to make her think
her dad is still alive?

29:57.926 --> 29:59.101
Why would they
do that?

29:59.101 --> 30:00.668
I don't know why,

30:00.668 --> 30:02.409
but I think
I know who.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.371
Cressida Clarke.

30:11.113 --> 30:15.335
So your father
did change his will?

30:15.335 --> 30:16.684
In secret.

30:16.684 --> 30:20.035
And he didn't make any
copies, just the original,

30:20.035 --> 30:22.342
which I think
he brought back here.

30:22.342 --> 30:24.387
Do you have any idea
where he might have put it?

30:24.387 --> 30:27.042
There are a few places
I could check.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.957
I won't be a moment.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.623
Hey.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.277
Turner, you need to
get out of there right now.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.235
What? Wh--
what do you mean?

30:46.235 --> 30:49.021
Cressida is one of them.
She's working with
the Court of Owls.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.718
That's impossible.

30:54.069 --> 30:56.463
Hang up the phone.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.205
Turner?

31:02.904 --> 31:04.297
I must say,
your detective work

31:04.297 --> 31:06.299
to this point
has been impressive.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.563
Your father would be proud.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.793
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.579
The phone, if you please.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.065
I trusted you.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.762
So did my dad.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.330
Have you been working
for them the whole time?

31:37.330 --> 31:39.462
Please.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.508
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

31:41.508 --> 31:42.901
Did you do it?

31:42.901 --> 31:44.685
Did you
kill my father?

31:44.685 --> 31:47.383
You have to understand,

31:47.383 --> 31:50.386
one does not
defy the Court.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.867
They're too powerful.
They'll kill me.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.477
Not if I do it first.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.479
Please, Turner,
I did not kill him.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.307
You're lying.
I didn't.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.009
I helped the Court...

32:05.967 --> 32:08.100
by making his death possible.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.102
How?

32:10.102 --> 32:12.452
I slipped a toxin
into his food,

32:12.452 --> 32:14.236
a small amount at a time,

32:14.236 --> 32:16.804
just enough to weaken him
to dull his reflexes.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.545
And then they
sent the Talon.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.068
You know the rest.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.765
Why did they do it?

32:21.765 --> 32:24.290
Gotham is their city.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.901
Your father was
a threat to that.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.598
And what about me?

32:28.598 --> 32:30.296
You were...

32:32.080 --> 32:33.734
collateral damage.

32:33.734 --> 32:36.955
Give me one good
reason I shouldn't
kill you right now.

32:38.391 --> 32:39.653
I can't.

32:40.915 --> 32:42.482
But please understand

32:42.482 --> 32:44.484
I never meant
to hurt you.

32:44.484 --> 32:48.488
I always cared
about you.

32:50.098 --> 32:52.622
Everything about you
has been a lie.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.190
Do you expect me
to believe that?

32:56.278 --> 32:57.932
No, but it is true.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.500
She's telling
the truth.

33:02.328 --> 33:07.028
Ms. Clarke has always spoken
very highly of you.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.639
In fact, she's quite
vocally petitioned the Court

33:09.639 --> 33:10.945
to spare your life.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.251
And why is that?

33:12.251 --> 33:14.949
We have misjudged you,
Mr. Hayes.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.646
You've proven to be
quite formidable

33:16.646 --> 33:18.474
as well as resilient,

33:18.474 --> 33:20.650
qualities the Court
holds in high regard.

33:20.650 --> 33:23.653
Swear your loyalty
to us,

33:23.653 --> 33:25.177
and you will rise
to such heights

33:25.177 --> 33:27.527
that the pain
and misery of this world

33:27.527 --> 33:29.616
will be
but a distant memory.

33:29.616 --> 33:33.359
The charges against you
will be dropped,
your name cleared.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.752
You will once again be
a prince of Gotham

33:35.752 --> 33:37.363
and so much more.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.235
All we ask in return
is your loyalty.

33:40.235 --> 33:43.412
You killed my father.
You destroyed my life.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.502
You expect me
to forget that

33:46.502 --> 33:48.287
and just let you
get away with it?

33:48.287 --> 33:50.202
The Court
will get away with it

33:50.202 --> 33:53.335
no matter what you do
or don't do.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.294
How can I trust you
to honor your word?

33:55.294 --> 33:57.165
The fact that you're
still breathing

33:57.165 --> 33:58.775
is all the proof
you need.

33:58.775 --> 34:01.343
However, membership
into this family

34:01.343 --> 34:02.953
does not
come without a price.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.608
Right. Loyalty.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.655
Tell us where we can find
the 3 remaining fugitives.

34:08.655 --> 34:11.179
You're asking me
to betray them?

34:12.267 --> 34:14.487
Do it.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.750
It's the only way
to save your life.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.624
Then it's not
a life worth saving.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.150
How disappointing

34:25.150 --> 34:27.630
but, sadly, expected.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.459
If you're determined
to die in the gutter
you came from,

34:30.459 --> 34:32.070
the Court
will oblige you.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.132
Uh!

34:56.920 --> 34:58.748
Come on.

35:02.752 --> 35:03.797
Which way now?

35:06.800 --> 35:08.410
Follow me.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.201
Get ready to run.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.316
I've been replaying
the last 10 years

35:44.316 --> 35:46.709
over and over in my head.

35:48.885 --> 35:52.672
Every kind word
she ever said to me,

35:52.672 --> 35:55.588
every homework assignment
she helped me with...

35:58.591 --> 36:01.811
every time she sat
with me when my dad
was working late...

36:03.291 --> 36:05.685
every one of them
was a lie.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.862
'Cause all that time,

36:08.862 --> 36:12.909
Cressida was plotting
to murder my dad.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.521
"The Owls are in the house."

36:18.567 --> 36:20.178
It was a warning.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.528
Alan Wayne said it

36:22.528 --> 36:24.530
and Pericles Jones.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.533
And it was true.

36:29.056 --> 36:31.189
The Court was in my house...

36:33.103 --> 36:35.193
and I was too blind
to see it.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.066
My dad, too...

36:39.066 --> 36:40.676
because
we trusted her.

36:40.676 --> 36:42.330
We all did.

36:42.330 --> 36:45.246
I'm not OK, Stephanie.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.466
It's all right
not to be.

36:49.685 --> 36:52.906
I had it in my head
I could go back
to my old life...

36:55.517 --> 36:57.476
that I could go home.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.436
How could I be so wrong?

37:01.436 --> 37:03.308
Because you're human.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.832
Anybody would want that.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.881
She was the last piece of
family I had left, Steph.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.187
I know.

37:13.187 --> 37:15.755
But that doesn't
mean you're alone.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.019
You still have me

37:19.019 --> 37:22.283
and you've got those
weirdos downstairs, too.

37:22.283 --> 37:25.199
Heh.

37:25.199 --> 37:29.072
This is the part where
you're supposed to
make me feel better.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.423
Hey, I'm working
with what I got.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.819
Are pizza empanadas
different than calzones?

37:36.819 --> 37:38.430
Why don't you
ask your new friend?

37:38.430 --> 37:40.388
Stephanie?

37:40.388 --> 37:42.825
You know, she's pretty
cool if you actually
get to know her.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.740
I don't want
to get to know her.

37:44.740 --> 37:45.959
Why not?

37:45.959 --> 37:48.918
Because in another life,
I would be her.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.398
What?

37:50.398 --> 37:53.967
I am just as smart
and just as capable as her,

37:53.967 --> 37:55.795
but she got born
into a better Zip code

37:55.795 --> 37:58.537
and has everything
I ever wanted--

37:58.537 --> 38:00.800
teachers who give a crap,
fast track to MIT,

38:00.800 --> 38:02.802
parents who didn't
abandon her,

38:02.802 --> 38:05.021
a life where she
doesn't have to fight
for every damn thing,

38:05.021 --> 38:08.416
where you get judged
for who you are
and not where you are.

38:08.416 --> 38:11.114
And every time
I look at her,

38:11.114 --> 38:13.726
I see what I could have been
just staring back at me.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.337
Harper.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.515
Luckily for you,
I know who you are,

38:20.515 --> 38:24.432
all right, and it's
pretty amazing.

38:25.781 --> 38:28.654
And the person
you're gonna be...

38:28.654 --> 38:30.656
off the frickin' charts.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.919
Who Stephanie is
isn't gonna change that.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.442
Just so you know,

38:34.442 --> 38:36.662
she doesn't exist
to make you feel bad.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.446
Her life definitely
isn't perfect.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.143
Yeah, right.

38:40.143 --> 38:42.842
Get to know her.

38:42.842 --> 38:46.019
Don't judge her the
way others judge us.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.588
OK?

38:59.467 --> 39:02.252
Forensics finished
up their analysis
of the mayor's limo.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.994
No fingerprints
other than the mayor's,

39:04.994 --> 39:06.300
no DNA.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.867
I don't see
any pry marks.

39:07.867 --> 39:10.217
Do we know
how the bomber
got inside?

39:10.217 --> 39:12.741
Well, according
to the mayor's
security detail,

39:12.741 --> 39:15.309
there is a key
unaccounted for.

39:15.309 --> 39:18.356
If we find the key, that
could lead us to the killer.

39:20.009 --> 39:22.708
Soto.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.841
It's the lab.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.974
Mm-hmm.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.323
What'd you find?

39:29.323 --> 39:31.238
All right.

40:09.058 --> 40:12.192
Did you steal
from an old lady?

40:12.192 --> 40:15.761
No. I stole from
a crazy old lady.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.458
And you know what,
I deserve it

40:17.458 --> 40:19.155
after what she
put us through.

40:21.810 --> 40:26.946
All my dad ever gave me
was a bloody playing card.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.861
I mean, her dad
was a rampaging psycho,

40:28.861 --> 40:31.994
and yet he managed
to look after her.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.170
She still got
her yolk scrambled.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.611
I'm glad
you came along.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.919
Now hand it over.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.443
Seriously? You're
gonna return it?

40:45.443 --> 40:47.314
No. I have a better idea.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.969
I'm gonna check it
for prints.

41:05.375 --> 41:07.726
OK, eliminating
nursing home staff,

41:07.726 --> 41:09.597
eliminating Eunice.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.338
You'd think someone
with "nice"
in their name

41:11.338 --> 41:13.079
wouldn't be
so creepy.

41:15.603 --> 41:17.213
Got a match.

41:17.213 --> 41:19.085
Duela.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.742
OK, last one.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.748
It's only a partial print,

41:29.748 --> 41:31.619
so it may not be enough
for us to get a match.

41:37.103 --> 41:40.846
The Butcher of Gotham
was executed almost
a hundred years ago.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.804
How the hell is
he the Talon?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.617
Greg, move your head.
