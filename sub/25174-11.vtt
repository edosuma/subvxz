caused by yesterday's
senseless bear attack.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.930
I feel your pain,

19:00.013 --> 19:05.144
but I urge us all
not to politicize this moment.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.563
Sadly, there is no way

19:07.646 --> 19:11.024
to prevent something like this
from happening.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.568
I wish there were.

19:12.651 --> 19:17.406
But today my thoughts
and prayers are with all those

19:17.489 --> 19:20.158
affected by this tragedy.

19:20.242 --> 19:20.742
God bless.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.245
- [scoffs]

19:25.747 --> 19:26.290
- Hi, Gary!

19:28.292 --> 19:29.543
I got your check!

19:37.217 --> 19:39.678
{\an3}- Miss Snap,
that bear sucks.

19:39.761 --> 19:40.345
He ruined all of my artwork.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.558
{\an3}Paddington would never
have done this.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.268
{\an1}- I know.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.937
{\an1}- If there's no fence, the bear
can still get out, right?

19:49.021 --> 19:49.938
- That's right.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.441
- So what do we do now?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.360
- We wait.
