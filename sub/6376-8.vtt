00:02.135 --> 00:05.593
<i>In 1907, a professional
swimmer named Annette Kellerman</i>

00:05.638 --> 00:10.041
<i>dared to wear a fitted one-piece
swimsuit on a beach in Boston,</i>

00:10.076 --> 00:13.341
<i>instead of the cumbersome
dress and pantaloon combination</i>

00:13.380 --> 00:16.213
<i>that was popular
for women at the time.</i>

00:16.248 --> 00:18.911
<i>She was arrested for indecency.</i>

00:21.821 --> 00:24.881
<i>As someone who has always been
known to make daring fashion choices,</i>

00:24.924 --> 00:26.551
I see a lot of myself in her.

00:26.593 --> 00:31.758
So, what Ms. Kellerman designed was
the precursor to all modern swimsuits.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.562
So, not only would she be
a fascinating feature subject,

00:34.601 --> 00:36.899
but we could do a whole
accompanying photo spread.

00:36.936 --> 00:41.805
"A Hundred Years of Swimwear. "
And I got the suit.

00:42.308 --> 00:47.405
Unitards don't really scream sexy.
More like 1970s magician.

00:47.947 --> 00:49.642
That's the first smart thing you've said

00:49.682 --> 00:52.173
since half the staff
had to rescue you from a cult.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.515
Snap!

00:53.553 --> 00:56.021
I'm sorry,
were we keeping that a secret?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.854
Betty, write the feature.
No photos, please.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.328
And since we are on the subject
of the swimsuit spread,

01:02.362 --> 01:04.421
everyone knows
we're shooting in the Bahamas.

01:04.464 --> 01:07.399
That is, essential employees only.

01:07.434 --> 01:11.564
Matt Hartley will be drawing up the list,
so stop sending me tacky flowers

01:11.604 --> 01:13.595
and do your sucking up to him.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.007
I'm fine with tacky flowers
or, better yet, cupcakes.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.204
Basically, I can be bought.

01:21.147 --> 01:22.580
That's all.

01:23.783 --> 01:26.752
<i>This will be my last shoot at Mode.</i>

01:26.786 --> 01:29.118
I've told you many times before

01:29.155 --> 01:32.955
that people will die at my hands
if things are not perfect.

01:33.526 --> 01:36.086
And this time, I ain't playing.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.926
She ain't playing!

01:40.467 --> 01:42.367
Oh, that was fun.

01:42.402 --> 01:45.667
Scaring the minions for sport
one last time.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.798
It's not for sport, Marc. I'm serious.

01:48.241 --> 01:51.233
Okay. I thought you just might
want to take it easy in the Bahamas,

01:51.277 --> 01:54.178
what with the Connor and Nico fallout.

01:54.214 --> 01:58.207
Fallout? My daughter betrayed me,
the love of my life died.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.048
All things considered, a bad day.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.012
I'm sorry, Willie.
If you want to talk about it...

02:02.055 --> 02:03.955
Do I look like a girl?

02:03.990 --> 02:05.855
Now is not the time to take things easy.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.587
You're only as good as your last shoot.

02:07.627 --> 02:11.358
The magazine business
is shrinking, and I am not cheap.

02:11.698 --> 02:14.690
One of the only C-words
in the English language

02:14.734 --> 02:16.258
never used to describe you.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.963
The other one's "cuddly. "

02:18.004 --> 02:21.098
<i>Well, fortunately, the editor-in-chief
of Isabella is stepping down</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:23.507
due to life-threatening health issues.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.033
And I have it on good authority

02:25.078 --> 02:27.876
that the job is between me
and Penelope Graybridge.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.643
Penelope Graybridge?
I've heard of her.

02:29.682 --> 02:35.552
She's beautiful and unstoppable.
And she's a junkie.

02:36.222 --> 02:40.818
Try to get her picture on one of those
"I Lost Me to Meth" billboards.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.953
This job is my only option.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.697
I didn't really mean it
when I told people to bribe me.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.600
- Didn't you? A little bit?
- Well, maybe a little bit.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.638
But with one spot left,
I thought I'd get some better stuff.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.640
This is just stolen office supplies.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.201
- Hey, that's my stapler!
- Not anymore.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.173
I'll trade you.

03:01.214 --> 03:04.672
- Oh, my God. You, too?
- It's not a bribe.

03:04.717 --> 03:07.117
I mean, yes,
I would love to go to the Bahamas,

03:07.153 --> 03:09.485
but I'm not essential to the shoot.

03:09.522 --> 03:14.289
This is just a thank-you gift for
helping me get Daniel out of the cult.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.261
You're a good friend.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.489
So, we're really friends?

03:21.434 --> 03:24.267
Yeah, I think we're friends. Don't you?

03:24.504 --> 03:26.972
Yeah, definitely. Friends. Great.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.135
I've got to get back to work.
Thanks for the pail.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.407
Yeah. Thanks for the stapler.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.089 --> 03:44.886
Justin, you've got to come in here!

03:44.924 --> 03:46.653
They just gave these people
their new house,

03:46.693 --> 03:49.958
and there's, like, 18 people
shaking uncontrollably.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.455
Hey, Bobby, what are you doing here?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.762
I just came to get some water,
you know.

03:54.801 --> 03:58.567
Oh, no, no, no, not this show, Hilda.
This makes me cry like a baby.

03:58.605 --> 04:02.871
Turn it off. Even though chicks
kind of dig it when you cry, right?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.705
Hey, don't call girls "chicks. "
You hear me?

04:06.746 --> 04:09.544
All right.
I'm gonna go do my homework.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.782
So,
why did you drive Justin home?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.178
High school can be rough, you know?

04:15.221 --> 04:19.351
I just want to make sure nobody
bothers the kid. Not on my watch.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.991
See? You try to act all tough-guy,
but I've always known

04:24.030 --> 04:26.396
there's a big softy under there.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.395
Ooh.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.968
Bicep. It's not so soft.

04:35.074 --> 04:38.237
- All right, I got my water, I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.547
Okay.

04:42.582 --> 04:46.484
Come back if you get thirsty again.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.359
Hey, I left something out of your gift.
It's all of your favorite colors.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.663
Wait, where's Betty's stapler?

05:01.701 --> 05:05.432
Okay, you can use that bikini,
but not that model.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.867
You know what?
You came in at the perfect time.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.638
I'm just finishing my list
for the Bahamas

05:11.711 --> 05:13.645
and I've got one spot left.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.204
- How would you like to go?
- But...

05:15.248 --> 05:17.341
You can be an associate stylist
for the shoot.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.944
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, a promotion! Thank you!

05:22.021 --> 05:26.515
Okay, but I have to ask you.
Is this just a work thing?

05:26.559 --> 05:29.119
'Cause you're kind of big
on the mixed signals.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.891
I know. I'm sorry.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.922
Look, I have a great time
when we're together.

05:33.966 --> 05:37.094
But sometimes it's hard
to think about you and me

05:37.136 --> 05:39.070
when other people are around.

05:39.105 --> 05:42.905
So it might be nice to get together,
away from other people.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.603
I totally agree.

05:46.546 --> 05:49.014
We're talking about Betty, right?

06:02.462 --> 06:04.692
<i>Amanda? Amanda? Amanda?</i>

06:05.131 --> 06:07.497
Amanda's going to the Bahamas.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.260
Mmm.

06:10.837 --> 06:13.101
I wonder what she's gonna do there.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.471
I guess she could not answer
the phones at Atlantis

06:15.508 --> 06:17.601
as well as she doesn't
answer them here.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.611
Did you not notice
how I hunched my shoulders

06:19.645 --> 06:21.909
and averted my gaze upward
when you approached?

06:21.948 --> 06:24.678
Learn how to recognize social cues.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.546
Hey.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.791
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:33.459 --> 06:36.951
Just getting coffee. Coworker coffee,
not I-want-to-sleep-with-you coffee.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.293
Subtle.

06:39.465 --> 06:43.026
Okay, that was weird.
Is something going on between them?

06:43.069 --> 06:47.369
Here's another social cue.
That means I'm not going to talk to you.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.869
Marc, you know something.
And you might as well just tell me,

06:50.910 --> 06:53.378
or I'll just chase you out of the elevator
and through the streets.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.778
Okay, fine.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.374
But only because you have
sturdy legs, and I'm in heels today.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.443
I will tell you one thing
and one thing only.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.080
Amanda has wanted
to tap Matt for a while now.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.258
And they went on a date recently.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.731
And they're probably gonna hook up
in the Bahamas.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.700
Hey, look at that, I told you everything.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.452
You know,
Amanda and I were roommates.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.014
Isn't there, like, a girl code that says

07:39.058 --> 07:41.788
you can't go after
your ex-roommate's ex-boyfriend?

07:41.828 --> 07:43.261
She has not inhaled since you left.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.094
And Matt! It's so obvious
that he kept me off the list

07:46.132 --> 07:48.293
because he didn't want to feel guilty
about sleeping with her.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.564
No! Language.

07:50.603 --> 07:53.470
- I've heard the word "sleep" before.
- I thought you were over Matt.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.440
- I am over Matt.
- She's not over him.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.876
Well, you know, if I was you,
I would get myself to the Bahamas,

07:58.911 --> 08:02.904
grab a fistful of that skank's hair,
and take back my man.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.712
I don't want to go to the Bahamas.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.049
That way, I don't have to have
their relationship shoved in my face.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.555
I wish me and Archie
could go to the Bahamas.

08:10.590 --> 08:14.720
A little island vacation,
that is exactly what we could use

08:14.760 --> 08:18.287
- to get the juices flowing.
- Okay, that I don't need to hear.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.356
<i>I can get you the Mode rate,
if you want. You'd love it.</i>

08:20.399 --> 08:22.026
They're putting everyone up
at the Cove Atlantis.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.228
Ooh.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.032
Oh, my God. You have to go!

08:25.071 --> 08:27.266
- Shakira's gonna be there this week!
- I love her.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.501
She goes under the name
Sidney Lumpkin.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.977
And I need you
to get this signed for me.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.445
Yeah.
Is that cute!

08:36.482 --> 08:39.006
You got married!
Oh, my goodness.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.347
Aw.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.989
My photoshopped life is so much better
than my real one.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.992
So cute. I'm not going to the Bahamas.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.192
Is it just my imagination,

08:55.234 --> 08:57.566
or is everyone around me
pointing and whispering?

08:57.837 --> 09:01.136
Don't worry,
they'll stop once it grows back out.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.266
I was talking about the cult.
But thanks, now I know

09:03.309 --> 09:05.243
- how you feel about my haircut.
- Sorry.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.769
I should probably just lay low
until this whole thing blows over.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.777
Come on, Daniel, who cares?
You're about to go to the Bahamas!

09:10.816 --> 09:12.443
Given everything you've
just been through,

09:12.485 --> 09:14.214
I think you should do
the exact opposite.

09:14.253 --> 09:17.450
Get out there.
Try and be your old self again.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.516
Wait, wait, you used to be
pretty judgmental of my old self.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.427
Wait. In fact, you're the one
who coined the term "man-slut. "

09:23.629 --> 09:26.462
Come on, people were calling you
a man-slut way before me.

09:26.499 --> 09:30.765
And you know what? Being a little
man-slutty might be therapeutic.

09:35.174 --> 09:39.577
I feel stupidly old-fashioned, but I just
can't do the collars the way you do.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.479
Thank you.
Now, get me my beer, woman.

09:44.383 --> 09:47.841
You are gonna more
than thank me in a second.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.154
I've got a surprise for you!

09:50.189 --> 09:53.716
Okay. Now?
I mean, I just showered, but, yeah. Hey.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.990
No, not that. Here!

09:57.029 --> 09:58.724
Atlantis, Paradise Island?

09:58.764 --> 10:01.289
Yes! Betty can get us a discount.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.768
Justin is gone with friends
for the weekend.

10:03.803 --> 10:07.466
So I figured it would be a good way
for us to, you know, reconnect.

10:07.506 --> 10:11.203
Hilda, I can't. I have a strategizing
meeting upstate this weekend.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.973
And it might look bad to voters, too,
you know?

10:14.013 --> 10:16.777
Taking a vacation in this economy.

10:16.816 --> 10:20.582
It's not a vacation. It's two days!

10:20.987 --> 10:24.047
Come on,
you know I would go if I could.

10:24.156 --> 10:27.023
But at least now you won't have
to deal with all my weird germ issues,

10:27.059 --> 10:31.086
like not being able to touch
a hotel bedspread, right? Right?

10:31.797 --> 10:34.527
Yeah, okay. Do what you need to do.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.868
All right, I'll see you later. All right?

10:47.079 --> 10:49.946
Hey, Matt.
Which heels go better with my bikini?

10:49.982 --> 10:51.779
These or these?

10:52.918 --> 10:54.078
I like those.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.144
Oh.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.754
You're not gonna wear that
on the plane, are you?

11:00.559 --> 11:02.618
You're right. I'll freeze.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.390
Hi, do you have my messages?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.759
That's great.

11:19.211 --> 11:21.543
Be sure to pack the portfolios
in my carry-on.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.743
- I want us to work on the flight.
- Wouldn't want any downtime.

11:24.784 --> 11:28.015
And do not pack your bathing suit.
I don't want any temptation to relax.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.750
- God forbid.
- What is up with the muttering?

11:30.790 --> 11:32.815
Why do you seem
dissatisfied serving me?

11:32.858 --> 11:33.916
Because it's not fair, Willie.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.519
Everyone else is going to be there
having fun except for us.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.087
And what's the point? We don't even
have jobs to come back to.

11:39.131 --> 11:43.795
<i>Marc, I will get that position at Isabella,
and, as usual, you will be my assistant.</i>

11:43.836 --> 11:45.030
- Think positive.
- I am.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.471
I am positive I need a vacation.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.034
Oh, I meant to mutter that.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.875
Congratulations, Betty.
You're going on a trip.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.043
And this time,
you won't be hidden in a wheel.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.451
You're working for me in the Bahamas.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.318
Muttery, you just got a vacation.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.590
Actually, I don't think I can.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.025
We leave with tomorrow's group.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.459
Whoo!

12:12.932 --> 12:15.230
I see myself in your glasses.

12:16.502 --> 12:17.696
So...

12:19.605 --> 12:20.799
Yeah.

12:31.784 --> 12:34.252
Wow, this place is beautiful.

12:34.987 --> 12:38.650
Can I just take a second
to drink this in?

12:43.896 --> 12:47.127
I certainly hope you're not wasting time
drinking in your surroundings.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.532
Well, the first photo shoot
starts in less than an hour.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.593
If anyone tells you
there's something called "island time,"

12:51.637 --> 12:54.470
drown them in their daiquiri and poke
their eyes out with the umbrella.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.838
- Got it.
- I also need you to find

12:55.875 --> 12:58.002
a wrangler for the models.
They need constant supervision.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.477
I don't want anyone tanned or bloated.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.639
I'm on it.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.382
I'm sensing a personal life here.

13:11.423 --> 13:15.052
Stop it immediately.
I need your giant head in the game.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.425
I've been here for five minutes

13:23.469 --> 13:25.869
and I've already seen Matt and Amanda
all over each other.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.566
I don't know how I'm gonna avoid them.

13:27.606 --> 13:31.167
Well, then, don't. Matt and Amanda
are the ones who have explaining to do.

13:31.210 --> 13:34.611
I say put yourself out there
and make them confess to you.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.808
I never thought of it that way.

13:36.849 --> 13:40.216
- Ms. Lumpkin, your room is ready now.
- Thank you.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.120
Hold on.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.482
Excuse me.

13:47.526 --> 13:50.495
Shh! Please don't say anything
'cause nobody knows I'm here.

13:50.529 --> 13:51.928
I got it.

13:52.698 --> 13:55.132
I love you so much!

13:55.167 --> 13:56.657
Thank you.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.469
Oh, my God, I just ran into Shakira!

14:00.506 --> 14:01.973
<i>Shakira? I'm jealous.</i>

14:02.474 --> 14:04.101
Love you. Bye.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.842
<i>I'm freezing to death, papi.</i>

14:07.880 --> 14:11.008
Please, if you loved me,
you'd let me be warm.

14:12.818 --> 14:15.912
Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.082
Bobby?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.752
Hey, Hilda, this was
on the floor of my car.

14:21.794 --> 14:22.988
Justin must have left it, you know?

14:23.028 --> 14:24.996
Whatever. Come in.
I can't talk right now.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.327
The knob broke off!

14:26.365 --> 14:30.301
I tried to turn it up 'cause it's like
Alaska in here, but of course it broke.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.201
- Look.
- Look at this.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.899
Look, let me take a look at it.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.999
Oh, this is the worst weekend of my life.
I should be in the Bahamas right now.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.772
But, no, my boyfriend has to, like,
strategize or something.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.543
And miss you in a bikini?
That's a bad call.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.151
All right. Look, come on.
Paper towels? You're crazy.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.881
All right, all right.
You know what to do?

14:48.921 --> 14:50.855
You kidding me?
I've done this a million times.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.357
All right?
Just got to turn this little thing...

14:52.391 --> 14:53.585
Ow!

14:53.626 --> 14:54.854
Damn!

14:56.295 --> 14:57.694
Why'd you turn that up so high?

15:18.884 --> 15:21.751
Ooh, a bikini, how fresh.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.950
We'll set the fashion world
on fire with this.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.821
And this one doesn't know
what it wants to be.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.884
It's the Anne Heche of swimwear.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.795
Get rid of all of them.
I want new options.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.422
Has one thing gone right today?

15:33.465 --> 15:37.595
We found a wrangler for the models.
And they're terrified of her.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.699
The locals say she caught a shark
with her bare hands.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.732
<i>Breaking news! Fashion alert!</i>

15:44.777 --> 15:46.142
<i>Ooh! Ooh!</i>

15:47.012 --> 15:49.446
Hover over the shoulder
of the photographer.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.847
His confidence is bugging me.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.284
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

15:54.320 --> 15:58.552
<i>It is with humble gratitude
that I announce my new position</i>

15:58.657 --> 16:01.717
<i>as editor-in-chief of Isabella magazine.</i>

16:02.027 --> 16:04.222
Penelope Graybridge.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.288
<i>And I couldn't have done any of it,</i>

16:06.332 --> 16:09.665
<i>without my beautiful daughter
and my husband.</i>

16:09.702 --> 16:12.296
<i>How could a girl get so lucky?</i>

16:24.149 --> 16:26.208
- Hi, Amanda!
- Betty!

16:26.251 --> 16:27.411
What are you doing here?

16:27.453 --> 16:30.650
Wilhelmina asked me to come.
You seem alarmed to see me.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.213
No, I don't.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.890
- Really?
- Hey.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.457
Are you sure? Because I'm giving you
the chance to be up-front

16:41.500 --> 16:47.439
about whether or not you might be
dating a certain guy that we both know.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.540
- We're talking about Matt, right?
- Yes.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.941
Amanda! Amanda, come on.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.177
Let's just talk about this.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.049
This is the only empty stool.
I know we're not exactly friends,

17:08.093 --> 17:09.617
so we don't have to talk.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.026
Hi. Drink!

17:15.634 --> 17:19.434
Is it so much to ask
for a little meaningless vacation sex?

17:19.471 --> 17:21.063
But, little known fact,

17:21.106 --> 17:22.800
there are no gay people
in the Bahamas.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.777
I have scoured the gym, the spa,
the private beach.

17:26.811 --> 17:29.975
Not a waxed chest or a condescending
attitude to be found.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.117
What about those two guys right there?
Totally gay.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.722
European. Rookie mistake.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.987
This is the worst gaycation ever!

17:41.026 --> 17:42.789
Can I ask you a question?

17:42.828 --> 17:45.126
Do you add the word "gay"
to any regular word just to kind of

17:45.164 --> 17:47.792
- make it your own?
- Gaybe, gaybe not.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.334
Well, if it's any consolation,

17:52.404 --> 17:55.999
I'm kind of trying to meet someone, too.
But apparently I've forgotten how.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.339
Well, this is your lucky gay!

17:59.144 --> 18:01.305
Okay, I'll stop that now.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.005
But seriously, I can help you.

18:03.048 --> 18:06.882
Girls love it when a straighty
is down with the pink team.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.152
- Who do you have your eye on?
- This girl over here.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.125
Excuse me, pretty lady.

18:16.161 --> 18:19.289
My straight friend here
is trying to set me up with guys.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.628
How's that going?

18:20.666 --> 18:21.860
Uh...

18:21.900 --> 18:25.063
Not so well. I could use your help.

18:25.571 --> 18:28.062
Okay, what about those two?

18:30.242 --> 18:31.971
- European.
- No.

18:32.010 --> 18:35.002
I'm telling you, this gain't easy.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.506
I'll let you slide for that one.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.483
- I'm Susannah.
- Daniel.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.682
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.989
- Amanda, I want to talk about this.
- I don't.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.858
Why didn't you just tell me
that you were dating Matt?

18:50.896 --> 18:52.523
Because I knew
you would get all vulnerable,

18:52.564 --> 18:55.431
and push your glasses up your nose,
and make me feel bad that I like him.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.664
Well, you should feel bad.
What if I still have feelings for him?

18:58.704 --> 19:00.535
Well, what if I have
feelings for him, too?

19:00.572 --> 19:02.540
Why do your feelings
count more than my feelings?

19:02.574 --> 19:06.135
Because I was dating him first!
Isn't there, like, a girl code about that?

19:06.178 --> 19:07.907
Not for pretty girls.

19:07.946 --> 19:11.040
And you only got interested in him
again when I started liking him.

19:11.083 --> 19:15.383
No. That is not true. I've been trying
to figure out how I feel about Matt.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.980
But it's hard to do when someone else
is already all up in his pants!

19:19.124 --> 19:20.386
Said it!

19:22.761 --> 19:24.661
I'll race you for him.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.830
- I'm fully clothed.
- So am I.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.407
- We're not children.
- Then I guess I win.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.068
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.323
Oh, God.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.704
Yes!

20:14.313 --> 20:16.975
In your face! I win!

20:18.317 --> 20:20.945
Come on, Amanda, don't be like that.

20:20.986 --> 20:24.717
You'll find another millionaire
to date in five minutes.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.518
Is that really what
you think this is for me?

20:30.696 --> 20:32.061
Betty, did it ever occur to you

20:32.097 --> 20:35.396
that I might actually
have real feelings for Matt?

20:36.001 --> 20:37.127
No.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.833
Because you're only
thinking about what you want.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.237
And what is that?
One minute, you want to be his friend,

20:42.274 --> 20:44.970
and the next minute,
you want him back?

20:45.611 --> 20:47.772
What about what Matt wants?

20:50.115 --> 20:53.312
- He invited me.
Betty?

20:55.354 --> 20:57.686
Betty, what are you doing here?

20:59.391 --> 21:01.188
Helping Wilhelmina.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.288
Which I should probably get back to.

21:04.329 --> 21:07.162
But this is good.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.002
I'm fine with it.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.238
So, all hell has broken loose,

21:16.275 --> 21:18.539
and no one can find Wilhelmina
to deal with it,

21:18.577 --> 21:20.044
which should worry me,
because the only way

21:20.078 --> 21:21.739
Wilhelmina Slater would disappear
from a shoot

21:21.780 --> 21:24.874
is at the hands of
bin Laden or Anna Wintour.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.247
But I'm on my first vacation
in five years.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.718
Okay, Marc, I can deal with it.

21:27.753 --> 21:28.845
I just had my heart crushed,

21:28.887 --> 21:31.048
but I can push that aside
and pretend like it never happened.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.750
That'd be great.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.811
I hate to admit it,
but I rather enjoyed that.

22:36.855 --> 22:41.258
- You let me think you died.
- You believed that? I'm so sorry.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.093
I'm over it.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.949
I still can't believe you're here.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.817
And I still can't believe
you ate a cheeseburger.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.585
Never repeat that to anyone, or you die.

23:14.192 --> 23:16.626
I'm so sorry I put you through all that.

23:16.661 --> 23:20.324
I'm here with you now,
so let the mending begin.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.232
So, how soon can we get away?

23:23.268 --> 23:27.295
- The boat comes back for us tomorrow.
- And what do we do in the meantime?

23:27.339 --> 23:31.776
I was thinking we could spend
the afternoon having hot, secret sex.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.338
Again?

23:33.979 --> 23:38.279
Oh, my, you are back
and better than ever.

23:44.456 --> 23:46.947
That never usually happens to me.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.826
It's okay.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.296
My wife died recently, so...

23:53.331 --> 23:55.458
Yeah, you mentioned that.

24:04.810 --> 24:09.304
Man, it's like Africa hot in here.
You do something already.

24:09.347 --> 24:10.712
Yeah, give me
two more seconds. Please.

24:10.749 --> 24:15.516
You said that a half hour ago.
Man, I'm a bitch when I'm hot.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.647
Yeah, you're kind of a bitch
when you're cold, too, you know?

24:17.689 --> 24:19.782
That's part of my charm.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.952
Do me a favor, all right?

24:21.993 --> 24:25.690
Take your charm and go get me a pair
of needle-nose pliers, please.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.595
I got you a pair of needle-nose pliers.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.567
I also got you a hammer,
a potato peeler

24:30.602 --> 24:32.092
and four different kinds
of wrenches, so...

24:32.137 --> 24:34.401
Well, it's just that these things
are a little confusing, okay?

24:34.439 --> 24:36.168
They make it this way,
so that you gotta call

24:36.208 --> 24:38.870
one of their service reps to come fix it.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.140
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Yeah, I do!

24:41.179 --> 24:46.173
Oh, my God, you are a terrible
radiator repairman, and a terrible liar.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.810
So what are you even doing here?

24:47.853 --> 24:49.912
I told you, Justin left
the playbill in my car, okay?

24:49.955 --> 24:54.392
Justin would sooner leave me in a ditch
than leave a playbill anywhere.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.728
I came to see you.

25:05.403 --> 25:08.839
Bobby, I'm in a relationship.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.165
Yeah, and you're happy?

25:11.710 --> 25:15.840
- What kind of a question is that?
- See, I've known you forever.

25:15.881 --> 25:19.476
I know what your face looks like
when you're happy to be with someone.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.748
I think about that face all the time.

25:21.786 --> 25:25.779
Maybe I'm out of line,
but I'm not seeing that face these days.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.653
Hey, tell me I'm wrong,
I'll walk out the door.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.925
You're wrong.

25:39.237 --> 25:41.171
Okay. Well, then, look, you should call

25:41.206 --> 25:43.140
somebody that knows
how to fix this, all right?

25:43.174 --> 25:45.005
- 'Cause I don't.
- Fine.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.408
Yeah.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.785
Wilhelmina? Hello?

26:08.099 --> 26:10.363
Oh! Oh.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.603
Next time, at least buy me a drink first.

26:12.637 --> 26:15.299
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:15.340 --> 26:18.070
Wow, I forgot
that this was a topless pool.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.342
This is the topless pool?

26:22.914 --> 26:25.382
Anyway, some updates.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.784
The model wrangler passed out
in the Dolphin Cay.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.913
Apparently, her method
of keeping the girls sober

26:30.956 --> 26:33.015
was to down their drinks herself.

26:33.058 --> 26:36.550
Also, the new swimwear is here
for your approval.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.193
Can I get you a robe or something?

26:40.699 --> 26:42.564
Betty, Betty, Betty.

26:43.201 --> 26:44.964
Take the stick out.

26:45.003 --> 26:48.632
- Everything will be taken care of.
- How?

26:48.673 --> 26:51.335
Tonight, you can watch
the models at Cain,

26:51.376 --> 26:53.901
and tomorrow we'll wing it
with the swimwear.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.310
- Wing it?
- Oh.

26:55.680 --> 27:00.947
It's island time, Betty.
Jump on board, man. Now, scat!

27:07.392 --> 27:08.654
Here you go.

27:08.693 --> 27:12.390
This is amazing.
When did you do all this?

27:14.032 --> 27:16.330
- I set it up before we left.
- Mmm.

27:16.835 --> 27:20.566
Well, I am on board. And on the Pill.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.569
That was a joke.

27:25.110 --> 27:26.407
To

27:28.213 --> 27:30.272
Our first real date.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.687
Bring it.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.795
You okay?

27:51.870 --> 27:53.030
No.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.299
Look at me. I'm hot.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.342
I'm actually having a really hard time
not ripping my own clothes off.

28:00.378 --> 28:05.008
But you're not kissing me
like someone who feels the same way.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.144
Amanda, I would love
to rip your clothes off.

28:08.453 --> 28:11.616
Thank you,
but I have to ask you a question.

28:12.891 --> 28:15.189
Do you still have feelings for Betty?

28:15.226 --> 28:17.820
'Cause I don't want to get in the middle
of something that's unresolved.

28:17.862 --> 28:21.821
Betty has made it perfectly clear
she just sees me as a friend.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.866
You didn't answer my question.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.706
Okay, Betty's not
in the Bahamas for work.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.942
She's in the Bahamas for you.

28:37.982 --> 28:39.916
No. No, she's not.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.884
She still has feelings for you.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.219
And if you still have feelings for her,

28:47.292 --> 28:50.591
then now would be
a really good time to tell her.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.110
How did things go
with Susannah?

29:10.148 --> 29:11.740
Great! I mean, wow.

29:11.783 --> 29:12.909
Not to talk out of school,

29:12.951 --> 29:16.182
but we did things I've never even
seen in movies.

29:16.988 --> 29:20.116
Easy there, tiger. Anytime a guy
overcompensates that much,

29:20.158 --> 29:22.388
it usually means
the other person wasn't into it.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.328
Oh, no, I mean, she was into it.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.625
Oh.

29:26.664 --> 29:29.394
You couldn't get the rooster to crow.

29:29.567 --> 29:33.333
Oh, Marc, that never happens to me.
I can get turned on anywhere.

29:33.371 --> 29:34.963
Elevators, ATMs, pharmacy.

29:35.006 --> 29:36.303
- Got it.
- Golf courses.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.740
- Okay.
- And once at a bris.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.868
- Wow.
- I mean...

29:38.910 --> 29:41.435
Well, look, maybe the problem is

29:42.046 --> 29:44.674
you're trying to be
who you were before.

29:44.716 --> 29:48.049
And you've changed since Molly.

29:52.056 --> 29:56.152
When that happens,
you know, it's hard to go back.

29:59.497 --> 30:01.294
You're really smart.

30:02.534 --> 30:06.561
No, Wilhelmina is really lucky
to have you working with her.

30:08.706 --> 30:12.608
Thank you. Would you please
tell her that sometime?

30:14.279 --> 30:16.509
Oh, no. I'm not sure,

30:16.548 --> 30:20.382
I think that guy over there
might be playing for your team.

30:20.885 --> 30:26.187
Oh, my God, you're totally right!
Good job! So, if you'll excuse me...

30:26.224 --> 30:28.351
Refill. I've seen my future,

30:28.426 --> 30:30.951
and it's needlepoint
and double-A batteries in bulk.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.589
Okay, console her
because Matt doesn't love her.

30:33.631 --> 30:36.259
And you, console him
because his wiener's not working.

30:37.402 --> 30:38.494
Bye!

30:38.870 --> 30:43.204
Oh, my God, Daniel.
Wait, Daniel, what happened?

30:43.241 --> 30:45.402
When we were dating,
you could get turned on anywhere.

30:45.443 --> 30:49.709
- Remember the Shapiros' bris?
- I know, that's what I was saying.

30:50.715 --> 30:53.843
Look, I'm sorry about Matt.
I know you really cared about him.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.615
Yeah. Pretty stupid.

30:57.088 --> 31:00.922
No, any guy who doesn't see
how great you are is an idiot.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.158
You didn't see it.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.720
Yeah, but we all know I'm an idiot.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.064
Very true.

31:29.854 --> 31:32.914
Hey, girls! How we doing?
Having fun? Yeah?

31:32.957 --> 31:35.425
High-five! No five? Okay.

31:35.460 --> 31:39.453
Gula! No drinking.
Sorry, girls, Wilhelmina's rules.

31:39.497 --> 31:40.964
But I know you guys are hungry,

31:41.032 --> 31:44.297
so maybe I'll sneak
you some shrimp later, okay?

31:44.335 --> 31:48.032
Come on, let's dance!
Let's dance. It'll be fun, right?

31:48.273 --> 31:54.439
Like party girls! Yeah! Look at us!
See? This is fun!

31:55.280 --> 32:01.116
Just a bunch of attractive
single ladies dancing.

32:01.152 --> 32:03.746
- Not drinking.
Hey, ladies.

32:03.788 --> 32:05.346
Hey, hi.

32:05.390 --> 32:08.848
Yeah, actually, I'm with them.
I'm their chaperone!

32:10.862 --> 32:13.592
- Hey, babe.
- Sorry.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.504
Matt...

32:27.178 --> 32:29.703
Wait. What about Amanda?

32:30.648 --> 32:32.878
She's the one who sent me.

32:49.834 --> 32:52.997
Okay, okay, you made your point!

32:54.605 --> 32:57.403
I can't believe I met a gay guy
in the Bahamas.

32:57.442 --> 32:58.841
Where are you from anyway?

32:59.077 --> 33:01.568
<i>Oh, you're funny.
You know I do lighting for Mode.</i>

33:01.612 --> 33:05.742
I can't believe I'm coming back
from the Bahamas with a boyfriend.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.950
Hey, you know, I'm really glad
you came after me last night.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.550
I'm glad you were just sitting
in your car, waiting for me.

33:14.592 --> 33:17.720
Don't you know by now?
I'll always wait for you.

33:29.007 --> 33:33.740
I took the liberty of ordering breakfast
before you head off to the shoot.

33:33.778 --> 33:38.579
I like my new life.
Waking up with you, eating food...

33:39.183 --> 33:43.552
As soon as the shoot gets going,
you slip away, meet me in the cabana.

33:43.588 --> 33:46.648
And then Robert will get us to the boat.

33:48.593 --> 33:50.561
That's room service.

33:56.134 --> 33:59.228
So, that happened.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.036
Yeah.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.834
- Kind of crazy.
- Yeah.

34:06.577 --> 34:09.670
- But good, right?
- Yeah.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.277
Oh, I'll get it.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.382
- That's weird.
- Hello?

34:21.559 --> 34:23.719
- The models are gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

34:23.761 --> 34:26.559
I mean, no one can find them.
And no one can find Willie, either.

34:26.597 --> 34:29.828
And everyone's coming to me because
they assume that I'm her assistant.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.766
I'm sorry.
I know that's driving you crazy.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.498
No, it's okay.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.199
Oh, hi, Matt!

34:35.239 --> 34:37.434
I tried to have an anonymous fling
in the Bahamas,

34:37.475 --> 34:40.000
<i>and I ended up
with someone from Mode.</i>

34:40.043 --> 34:42.603
Troy? He's always liked you!

34:42.947 --> 34:44.676
That was Gula. The models are fine,

34:44.715 --> 34:46.545
but some of them got on a boat
with some guys,

34:46.583 --> 34:48.016
and now they're in Cuba.

34:48.052 --> 34:52.011
What? Gula? She's our cover model.
The photo shoot starts in an hour.

34:52.056 --> 34:56.493
Well, I've got nowhere to be.
So, I will be here to help you solve this.

35:00.798 --> 35:03.562
- I might have just solved it.
- Come on.

35:09.006 --> 35:12.703
So, for the cover, we would be
shooting you in a bikini on Cove Beach.

35:12.743 --> 35:16.543
But this isn't just any cover.
This is our "Fearless" issue.

35:16.581 --> 35:20.017
I don't know, every magazine
has a bikini shot on the cover.

35:20.051 --> 35:23.282
I mean, that doesn't sound
very fearless to me.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.419
You're right, yep.

35:29.026 --> 35:32.086
- There is another way we could go.
- Really?

35:32.130 --> 35:35.657
I'm telling you,
I wear less than this on a ski slope.

35:36.134 --> 35:40.195
Wow. You look amazing! Hips don't lie!

35:40.605 --> 35:43.870
- Don't do that.
- Sorry. Okay, let's go.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.153
Are you happy?
I'm happy.

35:59.223 --> 36:00.485
Good.
- Everything's good?

36:00.525 --> 36:01.583
If you're happy, I'm happy.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.423
That's good.
- You'll tell me if you need anything.

36:03.461 --> 36:06.589
- Good, okay?
- Oh, my God, okay!

36:06.631 --> 36:08.724
- Excuse me just one second.
- Okay.

36:08.766 --> 36:14.796
Hi, Wilhelmina!
So, I had to make a couple changes.

36:15.072 --> 36:18.041
But I assure you,
there were good reasons.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.342
It's not terrible.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.313
Really?

36:24.649 --> 36:27.982
- Thank you.
- So, if you'll excuse me.

36:29.954 --> 36:32.184
You're looking good, Shakira!

36:34.458 --> 36:35.652
Hips don't lie!

36:35.826 --> 36:38.693
No, she doesn't like it when you do that.

36:38.729 --> 36:41.960
Nice job getting her, by the way.
This is gonna be a great cover.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.899
Yeah, well, she really liked
that whole story

36:43.935 --> 36:47.098
about Annette Kellerman causing
the scandal and getting arrested

36:47.138 --> 36:49.629
for wearing that swimsuit on the beach.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.198
Who pitched that?

36:51.242 --> 36:52.539
I have no idea.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.090
Everyone stay seated.

37:13.831 --> 37:17.062
- Go! Go!
- Go, go! Roll in!

37:17.101 --> 37:20.867
This is the FBI! Come out
of the cabanas with your hands up!

37:25.009 --> 37:26.499
We've got to get out of here now.

37:26.544 --> 37:29.809
It's too late. Someone tipped off the FBI.
They swarmed the boat.

37:29.847 --> 37:33.408
Well, then, strap on a scuba tank.
We'll swim away.

37:33.451 --> 37:36.352
Willie, stop.
We only have a few minutes.

37:36.721 --> 37:39.281
You have to say it was you
that turned me in.

37:39.323 --> 37:42.588
<i>- Use it to get back to Mode.
- I can't.</i>

37:45.029 --> 37:46.428
Room's clear,
take the next one!

37:46.464 --> 37:47.931
You have to.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.027
He's in there!

37:57.341 --> 38:00.674
This is the FBI,
come out with your hands up.

38:00.711 --> 38:02.736
Come on out!
Exit the building!

38:02.780 --> 38:05.442
<i>Suspect is in custody. Coming out.</i>

38:08.819 --> 38:10.286
He's alive!

38:10.321 --> 38:14.189
- This is all your fault! You trapped me!
- You're despicable!

38:29.140 --> 38:30.869
Cute, right?
- Yeah.

38:30.908 --> 38:35.470
And I have one more surprise for you,
something extra-special!

38:37.181 --> 38:39.081
- No!
- Yes.

38:39.116 --> 38:40.413
Is this...

38:40.451 --> 38:44.615
The bendy straw that Shakira
actually used to sip her iced tea!

38:46.657 --> 38:50.024
Hello? Oh, my God, you're back!

38:50.061 --> 38:52.689
Tell me everything. Even if you
have to make something up.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.063
I will,
but first, you have a surprise in there.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.903
I made a big mistake.

39:04.608 --> 39:07.509
- Archie.
- We should have gone to the Bahamas.

39:07.545 --> 39:11.140
I get so stupid sometimes
with my priorities.

39:12.049 --> 39:15.541
Anyway, look, I know one little dinner
is not going to make up for it,

39:15.586 --> 39:20.080
but I hope we get
another chance to go someday.

39:31.135 --> 39:35.697
Hey, Amanda, just wanted to check in,
you know, make sure we're cool.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.708
- Totally.
- Good.

39:38.876 --> 39:42.107
Okay, this is really weird.
You're asking me about my feelings,

39:42.146 --> 39:45.582
and I haven't had one clingy impulse
since we did it.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.615
So, we were there for each other,
and now we're good?

39:49.653 --> 39:52.816
Yeah, I guess we actually did this right.

39:54.358 --> 39:55.382
Hmm.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.553
<i>Mode magazine, how can I help you?</i>

39:59.597 --> 40:02.031
The Bahamas proofs just came in,

40:02.066 --> 40:04.728
and not that you care about
other people's opinions,

40:04.769 --> 40:08.705
but the entire staff is buzzing
about how great they are.

40:09.106 --> 40:12.872
Champagne.
I thought that you'd be more...

40:12.977 --> 40:15.741
Heartbroken? Connor is alive.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.214
That is reason enough for me.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.308
And since everyone thinks
I got him arrested,

40:20.351 --> 40:24.685
<i>I can write my own ticket at Mode,
which means you still have your job.</i>

40:24.722 --> 40:27.919
And you got your boy shorts
in a wad for nothing.

40:29.293 --> 40:30.385
Oh.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.091
Well, there's something
I need to tell you.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.367
I've accepted a job from Daniel.

40:39.003 --> 40:40.868
As his assistant.

40:41.672 --> 40:42.969
So quit.

40:44.074 --> 40:46.201
Thing is, I don't want to.

40:47.244 --> 40:50.111
I know it's not a job as an editor,

40:50.414 --> 40:55.317
but somehow I think Daniel will actually
try to make it happen for me.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.424
- Hey.
Hey.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.397
I made us some lunches.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.494
Turkey sandwiches,

41:09.867 --> 41:13.098
but I thought it would be nice
for us to stay in.

41:14.738 --> 41:15.966
What?

41:16.006 --> 41:20.534
If I'm not mistaken, it sounds like
the "we slept together, let's talk" lunch.

41:20.578 --> 41:22.603
I'm just scared, Matt.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.876
We've been through a lot.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.886
And what if it doesn't work out?

41:30.855 --> 41:33.790
I really don't want to hurt you again.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.291
I don't want to hurt you, either.

41:37.127 --> 41:40.528
Look, there's no way to know
what's going to happen.

41:40.798 --> 41:43.232
But I do know I want to find out.

41:43.868 --> 41:46.928
Yeah. Me, too.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.135
Good.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.073
Maybe that's all we need
to know, right?

41:57.748 --> 41:59.579
Are those the proofs from the shoot?

41:59.850 --> 42:02.648
Yeah. I was going to call you.
