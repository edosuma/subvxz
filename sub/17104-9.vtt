00:03.399 --> 00:07.400
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:07.440 --> 00:10.519
-I would love an excuse like
that to get out of class.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.679
-Katrina, your hair is a mess.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.400
MR. KENNEDY (OFFSCREEN):
Ethan, I want

00:14.439 --> 00:15.400
to introduce Christian.

00:15.439 --> 00:17.320
He's just joined us.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.800
-Where's my wallet?

00:22.839 --> 00:24.320
-There's some cash missing.

00:24.359 --> 00:25.160
I can give it back--

00:25.199 --> 00:27.519
-I don't want your money.

00:27.559 --> 00:29.239
But you owe me.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.399
I'm doing this piece for
the showcase tomorrow.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.399
There's a bit of hip-hop.

00:32.439 --> 00:32.840
You up for it?

00:32.880 --> 00:33.600
-Uh, yeah.

00:33.640 --> 00:34.280
I just do class work.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.600
I don't do extra.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.320
-I could have told Kennedy
about the wallet.

00:37.359 --> 00:39.119
You owe me.

00:39.159 --> 00:40.600
-Ethan.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.799
-Tweak, just let it go.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.719
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, let's go.

00:44.759 --> 00:46.240
[yelling]

00:55.079 --> 00:59.359
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh, oh, oh.

00:59.399 --> 01:02.359
Whoa-oh, oh.

01:02.399 --> 01:08.319
Take a breath, close
your eyes.

01:08.359 --> 01:13.719
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:16.719 --> 01:18.680
This is my chance.

01:18.719 --> 01:24.640
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.200
Whoa-oh, oh.

01:28.239 --> 01:29.439
Whoa-oh, oh.

01:35.239 --> 01:36.640
-(SINGING) Cupid, could
you help me out?

01:36.680 --> 01:37.239
Could you help me out?

01:37.280 --> 01:38.640
For she's the one.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.200
For she's the one.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.640
Without a doubt.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.200
Without a doubt.

01:43.239 --> 01:44.640
This is going to take a while.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.480
TARA NARRATING: I have this
theory that for every song

01:46.519 --> 01:48.239
there is one perfect listener.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.439
Hey, that's my idol you're
messing with.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.200
-That's your idol?

01:51.239 --> 01:53.079
-Yeah.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.359
And when you hear yours, it
reels in all the jumbled

01:55.400 --> 01:57.239
threads of your life.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.799
Tying them up into three
perfect minutes.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.519
Your theme song for that
moment in time.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.680
-(SINGING) Every little
inch of you.

02:05.719 --> 02:06.480
You move it.

02:06.519 --> 02:07.319
You shake it.

02:07.359 --> 02:09.840
You like some other kind.

02:09.878 --> 02:10.479
Want somebody.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.840
Want somebody.

02:11.879 --> 02:12.479
-Abigail.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.360
Abigail, ooh.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.439
-You people are so lame.

02:16.479 --> 02:19.360
TARA NARRATING: Then for a day,
or a week, or a month,

02:19.400 --> 02:21.479
the song's either playing
on your headphones or

02:21.520 --> 02:22.800
it's in your head.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.479
The theme song of your life
for that moment in time.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.680
-Abigail.

02:30.199 --> 02:32.159
-(SINGING) This is going
to take a while.

02:32.199 --> 02:34.080
She know I'm going to
make her smile.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.840
Want to give her everything.

02:35.879 --> 02:36.680
Everything.

02:36.719 --> 02:39.360
It's what you do to me, girl.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.319
This is going to take a while.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.280
She knows she can
drive me wild.

02:43.319 --> 02:44.639
Want to give her everything.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.479
Everything.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.479
It's what you do to me, girl.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.479
I'm feeling--

02:52.520 --> 02:53.039
-I got it.

02:53.080 --> 02:53.719
Got it.

02:53.759 --> 02:54.159
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Got it?

02:54.199 --> 02:54.639
-Yeah.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.039
-Got it.

03:04.639 --> 03:05.800
-How's it going?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.719
Sorry.

03:32.479 --> 03:35.159
You nearly had me.

03:35.199 --> 03:35.800
-I wasn't even trying.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.319
-Yeah.

03:36.360 --> 03:36.840
No.

03:36.879 --> 03:37.800
No, me neither.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.599
-What are we up to?

03:43.639 --> 03:44.800
-57.

03:48.199 --> 03:49.719
That's right, you
just rest there.

03:59.159 --> 04:00.319
Doing all right?

04:04.479 --> 04:06.319
You know the trick
to push-ups?

04:06.360 --> 04:08.159
You have to pace
yourself, man.

04:08.199 --> 04:09.560
That's a shame.

04:22.439 --> 04:23.800
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Whoa,
that's a lot of hits.

04:23.839 --> 04:26.800
TARA (OFFSCREEN): That's
a lot of weirdos.

04:26.839 --> 04:27.879
-Huh.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.199
Who knew Myles Kelly
had so many fans.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.480
-Hey, I'm a fan.

04:31.519 --> 04:32.160
-Uh, yes.

04:32.199 --> 04:36.160
-I rest my case.

04:36.199 --> 04:38.439
I'm serious, they're like
old people that don't

04:38.480 --> 04:39.839
dye their hair blue.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.759
-Katrina.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
-Mr. Kennedy.

04:42.839 --> 04:45.319
-Talk to me about your
online presence.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.319
-I'm not sure what
you mean, sir?

04:47.360 --> 04:48.800
-Tell me that you're
not posting

04:48.839 --> 04:50.720
videos of yourself online.

04:50.759 --> 04:52.560
-No, I--

04:52.600 --> 04:53.800
-My office.

04:53.839 --> 04:55.160
After class.

04:55.199 --> 04:56.160
-OK, sir.

04:56.199 --> 04:57.360
-Hi, Mr. Kennedy.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.160
MR. KENNEDY (OFFSCREEN): There
are Academy guidelines about

05:03.199 --> 05:05.680
posting personal information
on the internet.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.480
-It's not like it was
my phone number.

05:08.519 --> 05:10.120
It won't happen again.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.279
-Sit.

05:12.319 --> 05:16.720
I've been contacted by some
people at NAF Music.

05:16.759 --> 05:20.199
They handle an artist
named Myles Kelly.

05:20.240 --> 05:24.759
They want you for a small cameo
role in his new video.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.319
-Myles Kelly?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.800
-I wouldn't allow this
for every student.

05:27.839 --> 05:30.639
But in your case, I think
it could be a positive

05:30.680 --> 05:32.319
experience.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.480
-So they want me to dance?

05:34.519 --> 05:37.319
MR. KENNEDY (OFFSCREEN): It's
paid work after class.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.199
You have heard of this
Myles Kelly?

05:39.240 --> 05:41.560
-Um, yeah.

05:48.839 --> 05:50.199
-Hey.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.279
Scrambled eggs for lunch, huh?

05:55.319 --> 05:56.800
Interesting choice.

05:56.839 --> 05:58.079
-You reckon?

05:58.120 --> 06:00.639
-Well, I always go poached
if I'm after protein.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.040
Scrambled's like,
what's in there?

06:03.079 --> 06:04.639
Who knows?

06:04.680 --> 06:06.360
You can hide anything
in scrambled.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.639
-Wow.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.120
You've really thought this
through, haven't you?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.480
-Well, I like to know what
I'm putting into my body.

06:10.519 --> 06:13.319
-That's good for you.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.680
-You don't?

06:14.720 --> 06:15.639
-What?

06:15.680 --> 06:18.120
-Think about that
sort of stuff?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.720
-Uh, constantly.

06:20.759 --> 06:23.160
-No wonder I trashed you
in the last 100 meters.

06:23.199 --> 06:25.399
-Well, you didn't.

06:25.439 --> 06:26.600
-Anytime you want to rematch.

06:33.120 --> 06:37.399
[buzzing]

06:37.439 --> 06:38.120
-This is it, guys.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.120
Ground zero of cool.

06:40.160 --> 06:40.639
-Yep.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.759
It's a building.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.399
And seriously, guys,
I'm cool from here.

06:43.439 --> 06:44.160
-Oh, come on.

06:44.199 --> 06:44.680
We're excited.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.600
You're excited.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.079
-Mm, I'm wild.

06:47.120 --> 06:47.639
Can't you tell?

06:47.680 --> 06:48.199
-Hey, mate.

06:48.240 --> 06:48.680
I'm Sammy.

06:48.720 --> 06:49.519
This is Kat.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.680
She's here for the appearance.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.000
OK.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.519
Yeah, I know, she's dancing
in the video, this girl.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.519
She's dancing.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.279
-Hm.

06:56.319 --> 06:58.279
Waiting around backstage.

06:58.319 --> 06:59.399
I'm having a childhood
flashback.

06:59.439 --> 07:01.319
-You say it like it
wasn't awesome.

07:04.879 --> 07:06.160
-Kim, is it?

07:06.199 --> 07:07.040
-Uh, Kat.

07:07.079 --> 07:08.800
-I'm Tristan.

07:08.839 --> 07:10.000
Hi.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.199
You'll be, a small video
insert within the clip.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.399
Basically, what you do in
your online thingy.

07:14.439 --> 07:14.920
-OK.

07:14.959 --> 07:15.560
-Um, is MK here?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.639
-He'll be out later.

07:17.680 --> 07:20.399
Why don't you and your friends
chill, eat some sushi, and

07:20.439 --> 07:21.600
stay out of the way
until we need you?

07:21.639 --> 07:22.800
We cool?

07:31.439 --> 07:36.160
-Why does every R&B film
clip look the same?

07:36.199 --> 07:38.800
We've seen this one before they
even started filming.

07:38.839 --> 07:40.480
The moves are cheesy.

07:40.519 --> 07:42.639
The costumes are cheesy.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.480
I bet the song is cheesy.

07:44.519 --> 07:45.319
-Guys.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
How you doing?

07:46.399 --> 07:47.120
I'm Myles.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.800
SAM (OFFSCREEN): Myles.

07:48.839 --> 07:49.600
-Hi.

07:49.639 --> 07:50.240
-How you doing, darling?

07:50.279 --> 07:51.160
Um, you must be Kat?

07:51.199 --> 07:51.920
-Yeah.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.720
-Hey, I liked your stuff.

07:53.759 --> 07:54.519
-Really?

07:54.560 --> 07:55.839
-Yeah.

07:55.879 --> 07:57.680
So do you want to come have
a chat about the clip?

07:57.720 --> 07:58.639
-Um, yeah.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.199
All right.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.199
-OK, good.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.560
-No, no, no.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.560
Not us.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.800
-So, um, Brie, Feta,
or Camembert?

08:06.839 --> 08:08.800
-Uh, sorry I didn't mean
for you to hear that.

08:08.839 --> 08:11.480
-No, too late to
backtrack now.

08:11.519 --> 08:14.600
So if you think I'm so cheesy,
what's up with the tribute

08:14.639 --> 08:15.160
vid?

08:15.199 --> 08:15.839
-Ah, that.

08:15.879 --> 08:17.480
See my friends?

08:17.519 --> 08:18.319
-Yeah.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.800
KAT (OFFSCREEN): They're fans.

08:19.839 --> 08:21.120
MYLES (OFFSCREEN):
And you're not?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.639
-I'm just not great with the
whole commercial thing.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.759
-OK.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.560
So you're into songs that
mean something?

08:25.600 --> 08:27.240
-Something like that.

08:27.279 --> 08:28.519
-Hey, look.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.480
You know, this clip is going
to be a lot of fun.

08:29.519 --> 08:30.319
You know?

08:30.360 --> 08:31.000
We've got, um, great dancers.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.480
Uh, great choreography.

08:33.519 --> 08:33.840
-Yeah.

08:33.879 --> 08:35.639
Uh-huh.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.320
-All right, you've already
hurt my feelings.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.600
Tell me what you really think.

08:40.639 --> 08:41.200
-Honestly?

08:41.240 --> 08:43.200
-Honestly.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.039
-You don't think it's
a bit predictable?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.399
-Which bit?

08:47.440 --> 08:50.480
-Well, the chory is like,
yeah, whatever.

08:50.519 --> 08:51.600
Seen it before.

08:51.639 --> 08:52.480
And the costumes.

08:52.519 --> 08:53.840
I mean, come on.

08:53.879 --> 08:55.720
Show me a self-respecting girl
that would wear that.

08:55.759 --> 08:56.320
-All right.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.639
Well, just--

08:57.679 --> 09:00.039
let's just slow down on the
honesty part, all right?

09:00.080 --> 09:01.200
It's--

09:01.240 --> 09:03.159
this whole thing, it's
not really my call.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.679
I've got to trust these
people, the director.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.039
The choreographer.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.600
-Except it's your name on it.

09:09.639 --> 09:11.759
But what do I know?

09:11.799 --> 09:14.799
You're paying me so I'm
going to shut up now.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.200
-Your costume.

09:17.240 --> 09:17.720
[inaudible]

09:17.759 --> 09:19.799
with beats FM.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.720
-How you doing, buddy?

09:20.759 --> 09:21.480
Myles Kelly.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.320
-We're cool?

09:22.360 --> 09:23.519
-Uh-huh.

09:28.840 --> 09:29.399
-Oh.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.360
Hey, excuse me.

09:30.399 --> 09:32.039
I'm looking for Patrick's
office.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.399
And I'm guessing that this is
not the front entrance.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.159
-Uh, no.

09:35.200 --> 09:35.720
It's not.

09:35.759 --> 09:37.720
-I am so late.

09:37.759 --> 09:39.200
-Well, I guess I can
take you there.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.399
-Great.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.679
-Dana Strong.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.759
Ethan Karamakov.

09:44.799 --> 09:45.559
-Hi.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.360
-I loved "Symbiosis."

09:46.399 --> 09:47.360
-Oh.

09:47.399 --> 09:49.600
-The intensity just
blew me away.

09:49.639 --> 09:50.159
-Wow.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.320
Thank you.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.279
-Yeah, Ethan here, he
works in academics.

09:52.320 --> 09:52.759
Don't you?

09:52.799 --> 09:53.639
-Oh, I see.

09:53.679 --> 09:54.399
-Ethan, come on.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.480
We're busy.

09:55.519 --> 09:57.120
-"Tangents" would be
an awesome project

09:57.159 --> 09:57.919
to be a part of.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.080
-Ah, so you're auditioning?

09:59.120 --> 09:59.799
-Yeah, definitely.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.000
-Right.

10:01.039 --> 10:01.840
And what about you, are
you going to audition?

10:01.879 --> 10:03.200
-Christian?

10:03.240 --> 10:05.600
He's here on exchange from
the special needs school.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.519
He's got coordination
deficit disorder--

10:07.559 --> 10:08.200
-Ah.

10:08.240 --> 10:08.840
So [inaudible]

10:08.879 --> 10:09.799
to get back to?

10:09.840 --> 10:10.440
Yeah.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.320
Dana?

10:11.360 --> 10:12.320
-I'm going to be
fine from here.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.480
Thanks, boys.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.200
-You're hyperventilating.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.679
-You have no idea.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.720
Doing "Tangents" would be like a
master class in contemporary

10:20.759 --> 10:21.840
choreography.

10:21.879 --> 10:23.799
-All right, who talks
like that?

10:23.840 --> 10:26.639
And you want to spend your
holiday taking class?

10:26.679 --> 10:28.600
-Correction, I'm going to spend
my holiday performing

10:28.639 --> 10:29.399
with Dana Strong.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.320
That audition?

10:30.360 --> 10:31.559
Nailed.

10:36.519 --> 10:38.039
-Sir?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.039
-Christian.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.720
Hi.

10:40.759 --> 10:44.399
-Yeah, look, um, what happens
to me on the holidays?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.639
-Well, in line with your
bail conditions,

10:46.679 --> 10:48.519
you'll be staying here.

10:48.559 --> 10:50.399
There will be a couple of
international students

10:50.440 --> 10:52.159
sticking around on campus.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.759
What's on your mind?

10:54.799 --> 10:56.159
-Nothing.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.039
-That's a weird angle.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.480
What do you call that one?

11:06.519 --> 11:09.120
Oh, that's this one.

11:09.159 --> 11:10.639
Really?

11:10.679 --> 11:12.039
You think?

11:13.720 --> 11:14.440
-Guys.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.399
Guys, you've got to leave.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.639
Up, up, up.

11:16.679 --> 11:18.159
-You know, we're dancers too.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.320
-Yeah, you might want a dancer's
perspective on

11:19.360 --> 11:20.799
blocking the scene.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.600
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Hey, guys.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.799
-We're being thrown out.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.320
-Yeah.

11:23.360 --> 11:23.840
-Really?

11:23.879 --> 11:26.120
Can I come, too?

11:26.159 --> 11:27.480
OK, let's go.

11:27.519 --> 11:29.480
-Kat.

11:29.519 --> 11:31.440
What are you doing?

11:31.480 --> 11:32.279
-Sorry.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.320
It's just really not my thing.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.360
-Yeah, look.

11:34.399 --> 11:35.639
I really need your help
with something.

11:35.679 --> 11:37.320
Can you stick around?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.559
Please?

11:40.399 --> 11:44.279
-Oh, yeah, stay.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.639
-Please?

11:45.679 --> 11:46.639
-OK.

11:46.679 --> 11:47.360
-Thank you.

11:47.399 --> 11:47.720
Thank you.

11:47.759 --> 11:48.840
Come on.

11:48.879 --> 11:51.080
-So you want to change
the choreography?

11:51.120 --> 11:54.080
-Yeah, well, I guess I've just
seen this stuff a million

11:54.120 --> 11:55.600
times before.

11:55.639 --> 11:57.799
I want to get the girls out of
the booty shirts, put them in

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
hoodies, and--

11:58.879 --> 11:59.480
the moves.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.320
I--

12:00.360 --> 12:02.279
I want to try some new stuff.

12:05.720 --> 12:10.080
-Well, it's your video.

12:10.120 --> 12:10.480
-Yeah.

12:10.519 --> 12:11.720
It is.

12:14.519 --> 12:16.600
-Five, six, seven, eight.

12:16.639 --> 12:18.559
Boom, ca.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.039
Boom, boom, ca.

12:21.080 --> 12:26.600
And two and three and four and
five, six, seven, eight.

12:26.639 --> 12:27.159
-It's perfect.

12:27.200 --> 12:27.519
We cool?

12:27.559 --> 12:28.120
-Yeah.

12:28.159 --> 12:28.600
We're cool.

12:28.639 --> 12:29.440
OK, guys.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.600
Shooting first thing tomorrow.

12:30.639 --> 12:32.799
No black eyes, broken
legs, or whiny phone

12:32.840 --> 12:33.919
calls from your mother.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.519
-So, uh, Kat, got any
plans for dinner?

12:37.559 --> 12:39.159
-Are you asking me out?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.320
-Maybe.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.799
What's your favorite
restaurant?

12:41.840 --> 12:43.480
-Mm, Tour d'Argent.

12:43.519 --> 12:44.200
-Right.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.120
I'll book a table.

12:45.159 --> 12:45.799
-Mm-hmm.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.480
It's hard to get into.

12:46.519 --> 12:47.840
-Oh, trust me.

12:47.879 --> 12:49.399
-Plus, it's in Paris.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.720
-And you call me pretentious?

12:50.759 --> 12:53.080
All right, I'll take you out
anywhere you want, just

12:53.120 --> 12:54.240
anywhere geographically
possible.

12:54.279 --> 12:55.440
-OK.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.600
Hi, kids.

13:03.639 --> 13:04.559
-Hey.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.279
-You're late.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.399
-I know, I'm sorry.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.360
But we brought Crispy
Crust provisions.

13:07.399 --> 13:08.360
ETHAN (OFFSCREEN):
Who's winning?

13:08.399 --> 13:08.840
Let's see them.

13:08.879 --> 13:10.120
-Oh my gosh.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.440
-That would be me.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.799
Hey, Sammy.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.200
-Hey, Myles.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.120
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Hi, Myles.

13:27.879 --> 13:30.159
-Sorry, they're not normally
like that.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.720
-Your friends, they're great.

13:31.759 --> 13:33.720
Don't worry about it.

13:33.759 --> 13:34.879
-They're like obsessed
with you.

13:34.919 --> 13:37.200
Doesn't the whole fame thing
do your head in?

13:37.240 --> 13:38.799
-Well, not really.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.320
No, I love singing so--

13:41.360 --> 13:44.320
if I get to do that for a
living, who am I to complain.

13:44.360 --> 13:44.840
Hm?

13:44.879 --> 13:46.240
-I'd hate it.

13:46.279 --> 13:46.840
I--

13:46.879 --> 13:48.120
I'd run and hide.

13:48.159 --> 13:50.200
-It's-- it's like
ballet for you.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.360
You love ballet, so--

13:51.399 --> 13:52.279
-Whoa, no, no.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.080
I don't love ballet.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.519
We're on speaking
terms most days.

13:56.559 --> 13:58.480
-Oh.

13:58.519 --> 14:00.840
So, um, are all your
relationships that

14:00.879 --> 14:02.600
complicated?

14:02.639 --> 14:06.519
-Uh, I think I'll pass
on that one.

14:06.559 --> 14:10.399
-Because, um, they
don't have to be.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.519
-Hi.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.519
OK, everyone.

14:37.559 --> 14:38.360
Find some space.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.600
Spread out.

14:39.639 --> 14:40.799
Hi.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.320
And let's get underway.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.639
-You're going to be great.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.320
-Oh.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.519
I need to pee.

14:50.559 --> 14:51.879
Again.

14:51.919 --> 14:54.240
-Don't worry, I always get
nervous before a big show.

14:54.279 --> 14:55.399
-This is not nervous.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.200
I don't do nervous.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.399
-You sure?

14:58.440 --> 14:59.600
-Mm-hmm.

14:59.639 --> 15:01.519
-Maybe it's never been important
to you before.

15:01.559 --> 15:02.480
-What?

15:02.519 --> 15:03.240
MYLES (OFFSCREEN):
Think about it.

15:03.279 --> 15:04.600
It's your own moves.

15:04.639 --> 15:05.360
It's a little bit different when
it's your own creativity

15:05.399 --> 15:06.080
on the line.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.519
Mm?

15:07.559 --> 15:08.320
Just wait till someone comes
along and makes fun of it on

15:08.360 --> 15:09.559
the internet.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.159
-OK.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.399
And five, six, seven, eight.

15:16.440 --> 15:22.320
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.679
And roll.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.279
Up.

15:24.320 --> 15:24.759
Good.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.039
That's nice.

15:28.240 --> 15:31.080
And really dive into
that roll.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.399
Up.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.679
That's lovely.

15:34.720 --> 15:39.159
OK, um, can I see Abigail,
Christian,

15:39.200 --> 15:40.559
Ethan, Morgan, and Robbie?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.200
Everyone else, thank
you very much.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.360
Great.

15:43.399 --> 15:44.600
The rest of you, come
out into the center.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.799
-Uh, let's rehearse the
beginning again.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.159
Uh, first positions.

15:48.200 --> 15:48.720
Playback.

15:48.759 --> 15:50.399
[music playing]

16:04.360 --> 16:05.320
Thanks.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.480
We'll go for a take.

16:07.519 --> 16:09.080
Final checks.

16:09.120 --> 16:13.399
[buzzing]

16:13.440 --> 16:15.559
-Five, six, seven, eight.

16:15.600 --> 16:19.159
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.399
One, two, three, four.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.600
Good.

16:24.639 --> 16:25.759
DIRECTOR (OFFSCREEN):
And playback.

16:25.799 --> 16:27.360
[music playing]

17:17.519 --> 17:18.839
-That was beautiful.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.200
But it's not quite what
I'm looking for today.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.559
But thank you for all
your hard work.

17:22.598 --> 17:23.799
It was great.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.319
Now, I have some questions
for you two boys.

17:30.359 --> 17:30.920
Alone.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.079
Ethan, your first.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.680
Christian, if you could
wait outside for me.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.640
-That's a wrap, guys.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.200
Thanks everyone for
a great day.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.400
Cool.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.400
-Woo, that was fun.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.519
-It was brilliant.

17:42.559 --> 17:43.279
-She's right.

17:43.319 --> 17:45.279
You were brilliant, Kat.

17:45.319 --> 17:46.400
I reckon you should
come on tour.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.160
-Yeah, right.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.480
-No, I'm being serious.

17:48.519 --> 17:50.400
Make a surprise career move.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.519
I know it's not your thing,
but, you know, it'd be

17:52.559 --> 17:53.400
different with you.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.759
We'd make it better with you.

17:54.799 --> 17:55.640
DIRECTOR (OFFSCREEN): Myles.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.440
-Mm?

17:56.480 --> 17:57.400
-You got that pre-recording.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.160
-All right, cool.

17:58.200 --> 17:58.799
Look, I'll be back.

17:58.839 --> 17:59.799
But think about it.

17:59.839 --> 18:03.319
Things don't have to
be complicated.

18:03.359 --> 18:05.160
-You're going on tour
with Myles Kelly.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.119
-No, he didn't mean it.

18:07.160 --> 18:07.640
He was just--

18:07.680 --> 18:09.000
-He so did, Kat.

18:09.039 --> 18:10.400
You're going on tour, and-- and
staying in hotel rooms.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.720
And celebrities and
room service.

18:11.759 --> 18:12.799
-And following Myles
Kelly around?

18:12.839 --> 18:14.480
-Yeah.

18:14.519 --> 18:18.279
-You know, all my life mum has
dragged me around to these

18:18.319 --> 18:21.400
amazing places, where I've met
these incredible people.

18:21.440 --> 18:26.480
And it's great, T. But
it's never my thing.

18:26.519 --> 18:27.799
It's always about her.

18:34.599 --> 18:37.319
-So why do you want this?

18:37.359 --> 18:41.079
-Because it's my passion,
my absolute passion.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.279
-What do-- what do you mean?

18:44.599 --> 18:45.680
-OK.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.640
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

18:47.680 --> 18:49.240
-New York.

18:49.279 --> 18:51.599
Up there with the best,
as a dancer but also a

18:51.640 --> 18:52.599
choreographer.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.799
-Um?

18:56.839 --> 18:58.599
-Come on, take a shot.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.400
-I don't know.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.200
I mean, can't I just dance?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.759
-I've seen you dance.

19:02.799 --> 19:04.279
I know what you can do?

19:04.319 --> 19:05.759
-So?

19:05.799 --> 19:07.319
-So, Christian.

19:07.359 --> 19:10.160
There is a place up for
grabs right now.

19:10.200 --> 19:14.599
And if you want that
place, it's yours.

19:14.640 --> 19:15.039
-What do you mean?

19:15.079 --> 19:16.799
I got it?

19:16.839 --> 19:17.599
I won?

19:17.640 --> 19:18.839
-Mm-hmm.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.799
-You're green and I think
that's interesting.

19:20.839 --> 19:23.279
But you have to talk
to me first.

19:23.319 --> 19:26.359
I want to know who you
are and what you are,

19:26.400 --> 19:27.440
where you want to go.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.640
So talk to me.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.200
-I didn't come here
to do therapy.

19:36.079 --> 19:38.079
-That's your answer?

19:38.119 --> 19:39.359
-Yeah.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.240
Yeah, I'm done.

19:41.279 --> 19:42.480
Thanks anyway.

19:57.319 --> 19:58.039
MYLES (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Kat.

19:58.079 --> 20:00.359
Are you leaving?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.640
-Yeah.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.599
You've got your interview,
so--

20:03.640 --> 20:06.240
-You know I was serious about
what I was saying before?

20:06.279 --> 20:08.480
-Yeah, I know.

20:08.519 --> 20:15.640
And today, yesterday,
it was amazing.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.599
But.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.200
-But?

20:20.240 --> 20:24.759
-But it's your thing.

20:24.799 --> 20:26.440
-Myles, are we cool?

20:26.480 --> 20:27.200
-Yeah.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.200
Um, just two minutes.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.039
KAT (OFFSCREEN): I kind
of have to go, anyway.

20:34.079 --> 20:37.799
Do my own stuff.

20:37.839 --> 20:39.319
-And there's nothing I can say?

20:39.359 --> 20:41.279
-Don't.

20:41.319 --> 20:42.480
Please.

20:44.359 --> 20:45.480
DIRECTOR (OFFSCREEN): Myles?

20:47.599 --> 20:49.240
TARA NARRATING: I don't know
how many opportunities come

20:49.279 --> 20:52.640
along which can change
your life.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.440
Or how you walk away from
them when you realize

20:55.480 --> 20:58.839
they don't quite fit.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.799
So that you keep searching,
always believing that your

21:02.839 --> 21:04.559
very own perfect song
is out there.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.680
Even if it hasn't been
written yet.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.400
HOST (ON TV): Whatever you
do, don't go anywhere.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.400
I'm on the set of Myles Kelly's
brand new video clip.

21:16.440 --> 21:20.839
He is super cute, and I'll
be chatting to him next.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.640
-So I got the call today.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.319
Dana's invited me to
do the workshop.

21:25.359 --> 21:26.559
-Nice one.

21:26.599 --> 21:27.240
ETHAN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

21:27.279 --> 21:29.119
You were pretty good.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.799
-Thanks.

21:30.839 --> 21:32.319
-Just not quite good enough.

21:37.599 --> 21:38.799
-Kat.

21:40.759 --> 21:41.480
HOST (ON TV): Hey, everyone.

21:41.519 --> 21:42.519
Welcome back to the show.

21:42.559 --> 21:44.480
And today, I'm joined
by Myles Kelly.

21:44.519 --> 21:45.440
How you doing?

21:45.480 --> 21:46.359
-Very good, thank you.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.519
-Good.

21:47.559 --> 21:49.480
Now, your song, "Hey, Girl"
must have been--

21:49.519 --> 21:50.799
-Isn't-- isn't that
the pizza guy?

21:50.839 --> 21:52.200
HOST (ON TV): --written
about someone special.

21:52.240 --> 21:52.720
-Uh, well, no.

21:52.759 --> 21:54.160
Not really.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.240
But, um, I've met someone
recently, so I guess you could

21:56.279 --> 21:57.599
kind of say it's her song now.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.039
HOST (ON TV): Wow.

21:59.079 --> 22:01.200
I'm totally going to pretend
that it's my song right now.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.240
But could you please introduce
it because we are going to

22:03.279 --> 22:03.720
play it?

22:03.759 --> 22:05.160
-Of course.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.799
Uh, this is my new song, "Hey,
Girl," by me, Myles Kelly.

22:07.839 --> 22:11.799
And Kat, if you're watching,
this one's for you.

22:11.839 --> 22:13.079
-Oh.

22:13.119 --> 22:14.799
[music playing]

22:24.720 --> 22:27.640
-(SINGING) Hey girl,
such a pretty face.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.240
Too pretty for this world.

22:30.279 --> 22:31.480
Right.

22:33.839 --> 22:39.799
The dark beauty [inaudible]
it's such a shame.

22:39.839 --> 22:41.160
Right.

22:48.519 --> 22:50.480
-When did you do that?

22:50.519 --> 22:53.039
-Uh, glad to know you
pay attention.

22:53.079 --> 22:55.440
-Actually, it's quite cool.

22:55.480 --> 23:00.799
-(SINGING) You got me dancing,
dancing all night long.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.039
Dancing.

23:02.079 --> 23:05.400
You got me feeling the beat
that's pushing on.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.319
You got me dancing, dancing
all night long.

23:09.359 --> 23:12.720
You got me dancing.

23:12.759 --> 23:17.240
You got me dancing, dancing
all night long.

23:17.279 --> 23:21.640
You got me feeling the beat
that's pushing on.

23:21.680 --> 23:25.599
You got me dancing, dancing
all night long.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.160
You got me dancing.

23:34.559 --> 23:36.480
[cheering]

23:36.519 --> 23:38.799
-Oh, guys.

23:38.839 --> 23:41.480
That was cool.

23:41.519 --> 23:42.640
