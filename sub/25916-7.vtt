WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.511
[man] <i>Hey!</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:32.699
Drink the fairy! Drink the fairy!

00:33.324 --> 00:36.202
That's okay, honey. I go down easy.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.372
[all cheering]

00:43.710 --> 00:44.919
[slurring] Okay, okay.

00:45.003 --> 00:49.591
If you could be any mythical creature,
what would it be? Elfo?

00:49.674 --> 00:52.427
[slurring] Oh, that's easy.
Dwarf! [chuckles]

00:52.510 --> 00:56.222
Man, if I was a dwarf, I'd run this town.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.476
[slurring] What's the difference
between a dwarf and an elf?

00:59.559 --> 01:01.394
-I don't know.
-[burps]

01:01.895 --> 01:05.565
I had a good time in there.
Your organs know how to party.

01:06.357 --> 01:11.196
Guys, we should go home before
we pass out in the street. Again.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.281
[bell tolling]

01:20.288 --> 01:22.832
So tragically young.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.043
So tragically small.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.670
Eh, this thing had it coming.

01:35.887 --> 01:36.888
What the...

01:37.388 --> 01:38.431
Ow!

01:38.515 --> 01:41.726
Oh, no, no, no. This is bad.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.977
What is happening?

01:43.061 --> 01:46.147
Elfo, don't freak out. Just stay calm.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.148
Yeah, like this guy.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.693
-[screams] Are we in the plague pit?
-[man] You are!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.445
-Who was that?
-[Roger] Name's Roger!

01:52.529 --> 01:55.865
All we have to do
is find a way out before they...

01:55.949 --> 01:56.866
[torch ignites]

01:56.950 --> 01:58.993
Was she gonna say
"before they light it on fire"?

01:59.077 --> 01:59.953
She was.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.037
[Bean and Elfo screaming]

02:02.622 --> 02:03.957
[Bean and Elfo grunting]

02:04.040 --> 02:06.793
I haven't lived long enough
to give up on my dreams yet.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.837
I never got to see the world.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.421
We only just met.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.882
There are so many things
we could have done and then tried.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.176
Why didn't we give in to our instincts?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.637
It's too bad we never
experienced bliss together.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.432
We can, Bean. There's nothing in our way,
except this arm.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.894
Oh, Elfo...

02:24.978 --> 02:26.771
Oh, Bean.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.232
You meant bliss the feeling.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.317
There's another kind of bliss?

02:31.401 --> 02:34.654
Yeah, it's a drug.
It makes you hallucinate.

02:34.737 --> 02:38.074
You can do it in the Black Light District.
I always wanted to try it.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.785
Well, good stuff.
We should get you two outta here.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.246
You knew that was there the whole time?

02:43.329 --> 02:44.664
Yeah, saw it on the way down.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.917
-Are you coming, Roger?
-[Roger] No, thanks! Elfo, it's okay, really.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.766
I think it's sweet you wanted to kiss me,
but I'm just--

03:03.850 --> 03:06.728
Kiss you?
You think I was trying to kiss you?

03:06.811 --> 03:09.731
Uh, um, okay.
[chuckles] Yeah...

03:09.814 --> 03:11.733
Don't flatter yourself, Princess.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.234
You weren't trying to kiss me?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.278
Uh, definitely not.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.404
'Cause it seemed like---

03:16.487 --> 03:19.532
Okay, take it easy. I have a girlfriend,

03:19.616 --> 03:21.784
and I'm not just making it up on the spot.

03:21.868 --> 03:26.414
Speaking of the spot, isn't this the spot?
Let's talk about the spot now.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.505
Welcome, my friends.
One adult, two children.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.178
[man] Gah.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.348
Get ready to have your minds blown.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.142
Just breathe in and try to mellow.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.102
[Elfo inhales]

03:49.854 --> 03:52.398
I don't feel it yet. How much longer?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.442
Let's just all take another deep breath.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.110
[all inhale]

03:56.194 --> 03:57.028
Good idea.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.865
And on the exhale, Elfo will tell us
more about his girlfriend.

04:00.949 --> 04:04.035
-Dude.
-Yeah, who is this mystery girl?

04:04.118 --> 04:08.748
She's not a mystery,
but she's definitely a girl. Friend.

04:08.831 --> 04:09.958
She's my girlfriend.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.169
Hmm, kinda took you a long time
to bring her up, though.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.838
It sorta seems like you might be a liar.

04:15.922 --> 04:16.965
You callin' me a liar?

04:17.048 --> 04:18.549
Oh, that's the stickiest.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.469
That's just real sticky
coming from a friend.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.389
So, why haven't we met
your little bitty elf squeeze?

04:24.472 --> 04:27.183
She's not an elf, and she's not little!

04:27.267 --> 04:30.436
She's big! Bigger than you'll ever be!

04:30.520 --> 04:34.357
Okay, okay. So, what does
this big love of yours look like?

04:34.440 --> 04:35.692
I know what she looks like.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.820
She's got white hair,
buck teeth and two blue eyes.

04:38.903 --> 04:44.158
Wrong. She has red hair, normal teeth,
no offense, and one green eye.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.702
Wait, did you say one eye?

04:45.785 --> 04:48.955
Yeah, that's right. Yup,
now I'm remember... Just the one. Yup.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.582
Well, now I'm really curious to meet her.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.294
You can't! 'Cause, uh...

04:54.377 --> 04:55.295
Damn it!

04:56.087 --> 04:59.299
Let me help you out. She's from
a faraway land. We wouldn't know it.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.384
Yes, really far away.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.470
Like, way up the country,
past the Unpassable Mountains?

05:04.554 --> 05:05.471
Even farther.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.724
Then how did you two meet?

05:07.807 --> 05:11.686
Um, on vacation. Yup. With our families.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.314
Oh, such a great time.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.941
[sighs] Yeah. Her family's all dead,
by the way,

05:17.025 --> 05:19.736
so you can't look 'em up or anything.
Just, you know, natural causes.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.823
So, super-hot one-eyed girl
with a dead family. Sounds legit.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.869
Because she is legit and totally real
and very special to me!

05:27.952 --> 05:29.829
Okay, okay, Elfo, we get it.

05:29.912 --> 05:32.582
Now calm down.
I'm starting to hallucinate.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.796
Whoa. It's like I'm looking at you,

05:38.880 --> 05:43.176
but at the same time,
you're being looked at by me.

05:43.259 --> 05:47.221
Your nose is so beautiful.
Everything's so unreal.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.266
-Just like Elfo's girlfriend. [echoes]
-[grunts]

05:51.809 --> 05:53.394
[Bean] A drug door.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.982
Mmm, mmm.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.902
Yeah, here I go.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.450
[sighs]

06:11.496 --> 06:15.041
Look into my heart,
and you'll see the truth.

06:18.669 --> 06:19.796
[Elfo sighs]

06:20.963 --> 06:23.132
[chuckles and sighs]

06:23.216 --> 06:25.218
-[grunting]
-[heart beating]

06:26.344 --> 06:28.179
[blows landing rhythmically]

06:33.601 --> 06:34.769
[both grunt]

06:36.771 --> 06:38.106
What happened to you guys?

06:38.189 --> 06:42.235
Elfo, I owe you an apology, man.
I totally saw your girlfriend back there.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.821
I also had this profound realization.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.991
I'm losing it now,
but I think it was about scones?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.618
Let's get scones.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.625
[Pendergast grunts]

06:58.501 --> 06:59.877
Great practice, men.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.422
I think we're fully prepared
to slay a dragon.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.008
It was fun stabbing
all those iguanas in that box.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.760
[Luci] Can't believe
Elfo stuck to his story

07:07.844 --> 07:09.262
no matter how hard I laughed.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.722
Did you ever stop to think
that's because it's true?

07:11.806 --> 07:13.057
Nah, I was busy with laughter.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.893
I don't know, man.
There's something to that vision I had.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.062
That girl is real,
and he's in love with her.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.399
-We gotta do something special for him.
-[Luci] Let him sit on your lap at dinner.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.609
[Bean] No, he gets crumbs everywhere.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.862
I meant we should go find his girlfriend.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.614
-And by we, I mean them.
-Ya!

07:28.698 --> 07:32.785
Hey, hey, sorry to interrupt,
but are you guys available for a quest?

07:32.869 --> 07:34.495
-Just a moment.
-[grunts]

07:34.579 --> 07:35.913
You were saying?

07:37.331 --> 07:42.003
Remember: really tall, red hair
and, again, just the one eye.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.755
And she lives
beyond the Unpassable Mountains?

07:44.839 --> 07:46.757
You're gonna send these knights
to die on a quest

07:46.841 --> 07:48.634
for a made-up girlfriend? Cool.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.846
This wasn't a stupid drug trip.
This was a vision of the truth.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.723
I crawled through a door
and saw a rainbow,

07:53.806 --> 07:55.308
and I'd risk their lives on it.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.393
Is this quest optional?

07:57.477 --> 08:00.062
Silence, Turbish.
We'll have her to you in a fortnight.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.940
Don't know how long that is,
but you have three days.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.734
You gotta get her here
before the Royal Ball.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.360
Elfo will need someone to dance with,

08:06.444 --> 08:08.905
and I am not letting him
stand on my feet again.

08:08.988 --> 08:13.159
And if we succeed,
how shall I be rewarded?

08:13.242 --> 08:16.329
[Zog] With the goddamn salary I pay you.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.415
Now, will you shut up down there?
I'm trying to sleep.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.583
[knights] Yes, sir!

[knight] You got it!

08:58.287 --> 08:59.664
[screams]

09:05.253 --> 09:09.382
[groans] Can we have one dinner
where we're not watching Jester?

09:09.465 --> 09:11.217
Hmm, I'll hit mute.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.261
[jester] Oh, no.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.806
Personally, I prefer to watch the news.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.432
Hey! News!

09:18.516 --> 09:22.228
Is your dinner poisoned?
The answer may surprise you.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.982
But, first, we go live to the courtyard
for the return of the knights.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.110
Come along.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.073
[Bean] Elfo,
have I got a surprise for you.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.708
I knew that you were longing
for something,

09:43.791 --> 09:45.459
so I had the knights get it.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.502
What is it?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.421
Does this voice sound familiar? [woman grunts]

09:50.423 --> 09:53.759
[gasps] Is it my grandpa
trying to open a jar?

09:53.843 --> 09:55.761
No, stupid, it's your girlfriend!

09:56.929 --> 09:58.764
[growls]

09:58.848 --> 10:00.891
Elfo, you mofo.

10:00.975 --> 10:04.270
I thought you were a liar,
but it turns out you're a stud.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.149
Hey! [chuckles]

10:08.232 --> 10:10.359
How was your trip, sweetie?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.819
[growling]

10:14.196 --> 10:16.532
[Elfo grunts and chuckles]

10:16.616 --> 10:19.327
Traveling makes her cranky.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.331
[Zog] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, no, you don't.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.292
We ain't having no giant rampage in here.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.211
Send her back up
whatever beanstalk she rode in on.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.381
Come on, Dad.
You can't stand in the way of true love.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.425
He's an elf. She's a giant.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.886
It's gotta be so hard for them already.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.138
-I mean, think about it.
-Mmm.

10:39.221 --> 10:42.767
[grunts] I never wanna
think that thought again.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.354
Put her somewhere where I can't see her.
What's under the dungeon?

10:46.437 --> 10:47.605
The cheese cave, sire.

10:47.688 --> 10:51.359
All right. Stick her down there,
and bring me a nice hunk of Gorgonzola.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.821
Why am I the only one
defending your girlfriend?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.114
What kind of boyfriend are you?

10:57.198 --> 10:59.950
Uh, a supportive one.
She can fight her own battles.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.160
She's 12 feet tall.

11:01.243 --> 11:04.121
She did throw Turbish off a cliff
and eat his horse.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.458
[growling]

11:11.629 --> 11:14.215
Think you can make a bed
outta one of these cheeses?

11:14.298 --> 11:15.758
Anything but the Pepper Jack.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.346
[giant grunts]

11:20.429 --> 11:22.098
[Bean] Okay, it's all set.

11:22.181 --> 11:26.060
Pendergast is gonna take her chains off
so you can get on in there,

11:26.143 --> 11:28.270
if you know what I'm sayin'.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.731
I'm talking about the cave. Just go.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.941
I'm rooting for you.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.901
[whimpers]

11:38.906 --> 11:40.783
[giant growling]

11:40.866 --> 11:43.619
[nervously] You know,
if you think about it,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.496
we're both imprisoned.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.790
You, like a wild animal.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.835
Me, in a complex web of lies.

11:50.918 --> 11:55.631
Let's just take a minute and talk
about what we have in common... [screams]

11:58.342 --> 12:00.010
[oinking]

12:02.471 --> 12:03.931
[screams]

12:04.014 --> 12:07.101
Oh, sorry. Didn't see you down there.
What's shakin', bacon?

12:07.184 --> 12:09.228
Not my loins, I'm afraid.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.772
Stay where you are. I'll come tell you.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.024
Ugh. Why has no one eaten him yet?

12:16.652 --> 12:20.281
Cat-thing, I've always been my own man,
never needed others for advice.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.366
But now I'm a pig, and my life's a mess.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.077
Well, glad we had this talk. See ya.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.830
Thing is, having been handsome,
powerful and rich,

12:27.913 --> 12:29.999
I never had to stoop to kindness or charm.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.710
But now those things are gone
and so are the ladies.

12:32.793 --> 12:35.838
So, tell me why the damsels flock to you,

12:35.921 --> 12:38.591
someone far more repulsive
than yours porkly.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.468
I would love to give you
some great advice,

12:40.551 --> 12:42.970
but it will come at a great cost!

12:43.679 --> 12:46.599
-I get to ride you like a horse.
-I'll welcome the touch.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.642
Now we must get started at once.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.061
I need a date for the ball this Sunday.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.481
Okay, let's fire up the magic crystal

12:53.564 --> 12:57.193
and see if there's any attractive singles
in our area waiting to talk to you.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.236
"Him?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.489
-No."
-Hmm.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.992
Want me to ask if you're gonna die alone,
or are we good?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.540
[Elfo screaming]

13:14.293 --> 13:15.669
[giant growls]

13:16.462 --> 13:21.926
Oh! Oh, thank God I got away.
With so many things last night.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.303
Wow, looks like it got pretty rough.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.430
Yeah, I don't want to brag,

13:26.514 --> 13:29.725
but, at one point, I got my head stuck
in her eye socket.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.519
I'm glad you're enjoying
your time together,

13:31.602 --> 13:33.646
because I had a great idea.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.815
Oh, goody. Another one.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.986
[Elfo slurping]

13:44.073 --> 13:45.658
[munching]

13:51.831 --> 13:53.165
Pardon my curiosity,

13:53.249 --> 13:56.502
but when you two are making love,
is she aware?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.587
[growls]

13:58.671 --> 14:02.842
Don't listen to him.
You're obviously a great couple.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.262
Hi, I'm Chazz.
Pretty rose for the pretty lady?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.514
-Absolute--
-No, thanks. I'm good.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.517
Pretty rose for the pretty... [screams]

14:12.935 --> 14:16.647
No flower could have a stench
as beautiful as yours, honey.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.234
[sneezes]

14:22.194 --> 14:24.196
Was that Turbish's horse?

14:24.280 --> 14:25.489
[sneezes]

14:26.824 --> 14:27.992
Looks like it.

14:28.993 --> 14:33.998
Ugh! That was stuck in my throat for days!
Oh, my mouth tastes like a barn.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.583
She can talk?

14:35.666 --> 14:39.003
[laughs] Yes, of course she can.

14:39.086 --> 14:42.131
The hell is wrong with you people?
Get these things off me.

14:43.424 --> 14:48.262
I am not a monster.
I'm a person, with thoughts and feelings.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.431
For God's sake, I'm a grad student.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.559
That's why I love her.
She's so darn smart.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.644
I can't believe you all
put me through this

14:55.728 --> 14:57.187
'cause I'm his "girlfriend."

14:57.271 --> 15:01.108
Well, have I got news for you.
This guy is a filthy--

15:01.191 --> 15:04.778
Lover! I'm a filthy lover. So nasty.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.530
That's not-- [continues indistinctly]

15:06.614 --> 15:08.782
This just raises more questions.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.788
What is your problem?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.458
I just need to talk to you.
Please. I'm sorry.

15:17.541 --> 15:21.211
Really. I know I'm a jerk and a liar,
Miss Giant Lady.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.380
My name is Tess. Ugh, I'm outta here.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.715
No, please.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.301
Tess, if you don't stay
until the Royal Ball tomorrow,

15:27.384 --> 15:28.719
they'll know I'm lying.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.304
Why would I do you any favors?

15:30.387 --> 15:33.265
'Cause I'll do anything.
I can get you money.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.976
There's a ton of money in the castle.
I can steal.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.311
Money means nothing to me.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.939
Oh, come on. Everybody needs something.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.315
Don't you need something?

15:42.066 --> 15:44.068
An eye. Your eye is missing!

15:44.151 --> 15:45.653
[stammers] What did you say?

15:45.736 --> 15:48.238
You're missing an eye. I can get you one.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.657
-Easy.
-How?

15:49.740 --> 15:53.661
Uh, because I'm an elf.
And elves are magic, duh!

15:53.744 --> 15:57.206
We can make eyes.
We can make anything.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.834
-You can?
-Yes! Absolutely.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.462
You help me keep up the charade
a bit longer.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.882
We dance a little. We go to a party. Eh?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.426
Big gal like you like parties?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.011
I guess.

16:11.095 --> 16:15.099
Then we will have you walking out of here
with 20/20, my friend.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.184
[gasps] I'll be able to see out of it?

16:17.267 --> 16:19.937
I thought you were just gonna give me
a hunk of glass.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.564
That would've been the easy way out, huh?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.985
But, no. No, not for this guy.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.613
Wow. All right, yeah, you have a deal.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.824
But I'm going back to dinner.
I'm so hungry.

16:31.907 --> 16:32.908
You could eat a horse?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.369
-Don't try to be my friend.
-You betcha.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.329
[sighs]

16:43.544 --> 16:46.588
If you're gonna dance with someone
tonight, we'll work with what you got.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.884
And what you got are serious problems
in the face and body areas.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.846
-Fine.
-You need an attitude that matches you.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.015
You're sad and hideous. Play it up.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.558
Chicks love pathetic.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.060
I don't know. I'm not good at anything.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.645
Like that?

17:06.942 --> 17:08.235
Sad...

17:10.237 --> 17:14.033
Ew. Look at that gross, crying pig.
I have no interest in it.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.868
Me neither. Twinsies.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.162
Get outta here!

17:18.245 --> 17:19.329
[squeals]

17:19.413 --> 17:20.914
[grunts] 'Sup, ladies?

17:20.998 --> 17:23.083
Oh, my God. Cute cat.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.587
I know. So much swagger, right?
He's, like, ugly-sexy.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.589
Oh, yeah. Totes. Like your dad.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.548
What?

17:30.340 --> 17:31.341
Hello, there.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.180
Perhaps I'll see you
in the dining room, then?

17:36.263 --> 17:38.724
[Elfo] I can't make an eye.
I can't even find one.

17:38.807 --> 17:42.811
I've looked all over this stupid castle.
There's nothing. I need help.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.606
What are you coming to me for?
We don't got that kind of relationship.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.942
Oh, I'm desperate.
Please, I'll do anything.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.152
Anything?

17:51.987 --> 17:54.990
[groans] My knees are full of splinters.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.368
Did I say I wanted a talking horse?
[grunts]

17:59.745 --> 18:01.497
I've been messing with this
for a couple days.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.375
-Might point you in the right direction.
-[clears throat] Hi, I'm Elfo.

18:05.459 --> 18:09.880
Is there anything around here
I can use to replace a giant's eye?

18:09.963 --> 18:10.923
[crystal ball buzzes]

18:11.006 --> 18:12.132
Eh, we gave it a shot.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.483
[gasps] Weapons?
You people have got to stop.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.734
I'm not dangerous.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.611
This is your hair and makeup team.

18:32.694 --> 18:36.657
You're already beautiful.
We're just gonna highlight a few things.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.575
Bring in the hot tar!

18:49.419 --> 18:50.254
[growls]

18:52.172 --> 18:54.174
-[fox growling]
-[birds chirping]

18:57.344 --> 18:58.762
[oxen bellowing]

19:14.486 --> 19:16.780
[all clapping and exclaiming]

19:16.864 --> 19:18.866
-[instrumental music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

19:28.542 --> 19:30.711
[bugle blaring]

19:30.794 --> 19:32.880
Now let's greet our hosts.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.425
She oozes grace and a shiny trail
wherever she goes.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.052
He ate all the shrimp before you got here.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.264
-It's Queen Oona and King Zog.
-[guests clapping]

19:42.347 --> 19:44.099
Make room on the dance floor,

19:44.183 --> 19:46.768
'cause I'm full of shrimp
and I need to lay down.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.854
Princess, now that we're courting--

19:48.937 --> 19:52.482
Don't say courting. No one's courting.
But you can bring me a drink.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.194
But you're already... All right.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.236
[chuckling]

19:57.070 --> 19:58.071
You scoundrel.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.241
You said to act pathetic to these women.
Then you swept in and stole them.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.327
I know. Some of my best work.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.703
I thought we were friends.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.831
The Adventures of Cat and Pig.
That's what I've been calling us.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.333
To who?

20:09.416 --> 20:12.252
All I wanted to do was dance in the arms
of someone beautiful,

20:12.336 --> 20:13.670
and you took that away.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.672
This has been our last adventure.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.758
Oh, man, I actually feel kind of bad.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.176
Do you need to be alone?

20:19.259 --> 20:21.345
Oh, no, I need to be comforted.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.096
Maybe a little behind the ears.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.515
And now, our guests of honor.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.894
Brace yourselves
for the inevitable visualizations.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.063
Elfo and Tess!

20:32.522 --> 20:34.191
[exclaiming]

20:46.036 --> 20:48.580
So, one quick dance,
then you can go back home.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.457
But the eye's not working yet.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.459
Huh, weird.

20:52.542 --> 20:55.921
May not be seeing well,
but it is looking good.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.923
Just gotta straighten it out here.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.634
What the hell?

21:00.717 --> 21:02.427
Wait, something's happening.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.389
I can see out of it. I can see everything.

21:05.472 --> 21:09.977
More than everything. I see the truth.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.605
He's sleeping with the chambermaid.
And she's sleeping with the chambermaid.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.316
What can I say? I'm attracted
to people who are good at their job.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.860
And you, you're so kind,

21:18.944 --> 21:22.114
but you have a hidden rage inside you
that no one else can see.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.283
It's why I can't keep a dog alive.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.910
You only keep Elfo around for his blood.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.996
[laughs] You have got to be...

21:29.079 --> 21:31.039
Oh, you know what?
I think I already knew that.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.626
And you. You're not at all what you seem.
You're a prince.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.463
Yes, I was the handsomest prince
in all the land.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.882
He's not lying. He really believes that.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.010
And now for Elfo...

21:45.679 --> 21:46.888
Here's the truth.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.098
No, no, no, wait, please.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.516
Let me do it.

21:50.392 --> 21:54.688
Bean, I should've confessed this
a long time ago, but I was too ashamed.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.607
Tess was never my girlfriend.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.943
I've been lying to you about that. Oh, um, well,
I wasn't gonna say that at all.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.032
[chuckles] I mean, a deal's a deal. Yikes.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.576
You were lying?
But my mystical vision.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.329
I crawled through the hole,
the giant lady popped out of the flower,

22:10.412 --> 22:12.998
and you were there and...
Oh, drugs are bad.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.834
Oh, all right. Hey, everybody calm down.

22:15.917 --> 22:20.130
We don't want to upset
the nice big lady, huh?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.301
You don't think I'm nice.
None of you do.

22:24.384 --> 22:28.889
You all think I'm a big scary monster
who's gonna go on a rampage.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.099
Well, newsflash.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.935
Giants haven't been on a rampage
since the '80s.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.271
And even then, it was one guy.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.065
It was just Bob.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.483
Maybe if you got to know us,

22:39.566 --> 22:45.614
you'd find out that we're all about peace
and love and goddamn body positivity!

22:45.697 --> 22:49.826
But I guess we'll just
always be ugly beasts to you.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.954
Well, fine.
Think I'm ugly all you want.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.916
At least I'm not ugly on the inside.

22:55.999 --> 23:00.545
I've come to slay the mean lady
who threw me off a cliff and ate my horse.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.173
Turbish, no! Your horse is still alive!

23:03.256 --> 23:04.341
What?

23:04.424 --> 23:06.635
-Ow! Seriously?
-[guests exclaiming]

23:06.718 --> 23:09.721
Oh! Damn it. Let me get that.
Hang on. No, wait.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.806
Oh, God.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.724
No. Stop.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.309
I've got this.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.646
-She's burning the castle!
-She'll eat us alive!

23:17.729 --> 23:19.731
This validates my bigotry!

23:19.815 --> 23:22.984
She's been a burden on the pantry.
Kill her.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.988
[yelling]

23:27.072 --> 23:31.243
Monsters are afraid of fire.
We've got her cornered.

23:33.328 --> 23:34.329
[Tess grunts]

23:36.248 --> 23:37.374
[guests gasp]

23:38.166 --> 23:39.000
[guests scream]

23:39.084 --> 23:40.502
Tess, follow me.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.878
Why should I trust you?

23:41.962 --> 23:44.840
Because sometimes
I feel like a freak, too.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.426
Never said I was a freak.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.680
Wow, you're trapped in a pretty sad life.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.515
Want me to go back and step on your dad?

23:53.598 --> 23:54.975
No, we don't have time.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.608
[all yelling]

24:09.656 --> 24:10.824
Quick! This way.

24:12.742 --> 24:13.827
We're trapped.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.328
No, we're not.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.414
Now, Tess, I know you're not a monster.

24:17.914 --> 24:22.127
But I'm gonna need you
to jump up and down. Like a monster.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.545
That was implied, right?

24:27.799 --> 24:31.845
Whoa. Are you the 9:30 bus to Twinkletown?

24:34.556 --> 24:37.559
Take a deep breath and fire
on the count of three.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.354
One... two...

24:43.106 --> 24:45.400
-Wait, I'm sorry, man.
-[all coughing]

24:45.484 --> 24:47.861
What were we just talking about?

24:51.615 --> 24:53.825
-Where'd she go?
-Which one's the giant?

24:53.909 --> 24:55.827
[man] That green guy's freaking me out.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.871
[all mumbling indistinctly]

25:00.916 --> 25:03.335
Tess, I'm so sorry about everything.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.922
Well, you helped me out of here,
so I guess it's cool.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.008
-It is?
-No! You're a dick.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.928
None of this would've happened
if you'd just told the truth.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.012
God!

25:16.765 --> 25:19.434
Take me with you.
These savages don't deserve us.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.436
-Come on, cutie.
-Really?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.983
You and I are two of a kind.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.153
I was a gorgeous nobleman
before I became a pig.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.531
What were you before you turned hideous?

25:32.614 --> 25:34.574
[squeals]

25:36.201 --> 25:37.702
[Meriker] Sad...

25:42.082 --> 25:44.543
I should have known
she wasn't your girlfriend.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.419
I should have just told you the truth.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.506
I lied because I was too insecure
to admit I tried to kiss you.

25:49.589 --> 25:53.176
But you don't have to worry.
I won't try anything like that again.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.887
Good. Let me do it next time.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.597
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.812
Bean, did... did you just kiss me?

26:03.895 --> 26:06.815
I don't know. I don't think I'm Bean.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.441
I don't think I'm Elfo.
