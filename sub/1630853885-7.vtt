WEBVTT

00:13.722 --> 00:15.265
That man loved life.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.852
I'm not denying
that Emmett had medical issues,

00:19.353 --> 00:21.188
but he never let it get him down.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.483
He had a passion for life.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.402
Emmett…

00:29.029 --> 00:31.657
he made you appreciate
your good fortune.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.243
'Cause even though he was strapped
in a hospital bed,

00:35.035 --> 00:38.372
he was more alive
than most folks who can use their legs.

00:39.748 --> 00:43.919
He loved to laugh. He loved people.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.298
I'm sorry you lost him. I am.

00:49.174 --> 00:53.762
I didn't lose him. He was taken from me.

00:55.222 --> 00:59.643
Did Emmett say anything
about what was going on at LifeCare?

00:59.726 --> 01:02.229
Did-- Did you talk to him
on that last Thursday?

01:02.980 --> 01:05.232
His phone wasn't working by then.

01:05.315 --> 01:09.862
I tried reaching him
on Wednesday and Thursday.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.324
Before that, he said that--

01:14.408 --> 01:18.996
you know, th-- things were a little crazy,
but he didn't dwell on that.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.040
He didn't wanna worry me.

01:24.376 --> 01:28.213
He even was joking
about what he had for breakfast.

01:28.839 --> 01:33.760
Said he had canned tuna fish and crackers…

01:34.970 --> 01:36.305
and relish.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.767
Said it was delicious.

01:42.853 --> 01:46.607
My Emmett. He was a fighter.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.611
And for him to have died
of his own accord?

01:51.278 --> 01:52.613
That don't make no sense.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.325
None. Whatsoever.

02:00.537 --> 02:05.334
Wade in the water

02:07.169 --> 02:12.174
Wade in the water, children

02:13.258 --> 02:18.055
Wade in the water

02:18.138 --> 02:23.352
Wade in the water, children

02:23.435 --> 02:28.023
Wade in the water

02:28.106 --> 02:33.403
God is gonna trouble these waters

02:33.487 --> 02:37.491
Man went down to the river

02:38.450 --> 02:43.372
Man went down to the river, Lord

02:43.455 --> 02:47.626
Man went down to the river

02:48.460 --> 02:52.130
Went down there for to pray

02:52.673 --> 02:53.674
Oh

02:53.757 --> 02:57.594
Wade in the water

02:58.846 --> 03:03.684
Wade in the water, children

03:03.767 --> 03:07.646
Wade in the water

03:08.355 --> 03:13.360
God is gonna trouble these waters

03:18.490 --> 03:25.372
God's gonna trouble these waters

04:11.126 --> 04:13.754
-Hey, how you doing? You remember us?
-Yes, sir.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.089
Yeah, I got that warrant for you.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.177
-You got any more men in there?
-Yes, sir.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.887
Well, get 'em outside.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.308
-Hey, Remy. Remy!
-Hey, guys.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.893
Get everyone out here now!

04:28.977 --> 04:30.646
Y'all are gonna need to stay out here

04:30.729 --> 04:32.814
until we get done with our work.
Understood?

04:34.691 --> 04:35.817
Appreciate it.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.338
All right, everybody.
Fan out and document whatever you see.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.632
-Yes, sir.
-You got it, Captain.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.176
Man, the smell of death,
I can never get used to it.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.345
Yeah. That's why I love accounting.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.695
Thought there wasn't any food or water.

05:20.529 --> 05:24.324
Yeah, except for these cases of water
stacked all the way to the ceiling.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.118
Canned goods all over the place.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.049
Be careful. That area's blocked off.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.530
Pharmacy's locked,
but we're about to gain entry.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.183
Check this out.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.937
Three prescriptions for morphine,
all signed by Anna Pou.

07:21.984 --> 07:22.985
Hey.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.946
Someone found this on seven.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.203
It's exactly what Nakamaru described.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.248
You know,
I've learned to never get surprised.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.711
But then I get surprised.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.214
We've got four witnesses
all confirming the same story.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.177
Pou came up to the seventh floor
to end the lives of patients.

07:48.886 --> 07:53.098
Then we find syringes, drug vials,
Pou's name on the prescriptions.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.144
-You don't think that's enough?
-No.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.190
Two of the witnesses said
that Pou told them directly

08:01.273 --> 08:03.233
that lethal injection was her intention.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.776
Th-Those doctors and nurses,

08:04.860 --> 08:07.196
they-- they volunteered
to be in that hospital.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.491
Then they stayed for five days
during the worst possible conditions.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.828
How could their motives have been
to intentionally harm their patients?

08:15.662 --> 08:18.415
-To kill their patients.
-But we can't deny the evidence.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.756
We need to prove
that Pou and those two nurses

08:25.839 --> 08:27.633
not only injected those patients

08:27.716 --> 08:29.885
but did so
with the intention to kill them.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.388
Most of all, we need an eyewitness.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.557
Somebody who saw them do it.

08:56.245 --> 09:00.541
Francis, Vince said that he'd take you up
on this weekend, okay? So give him a call.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.469
-How are you feeling today, Mrs. Allen?
-Pretty good.

09:12.553 --> 09:15.722
-Pretty good?
-Well, I don't want to jinx it.

09:19.852 --> 09:24.022
Well, jinx it all you want.
This is looking perfect.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.193
-Thank you, Doc.
-Of course.

09:28.277 --> 09:31.947
-You know, I still need that recipe.
-My daughter's bringing it in today.

09:32.030 --> 09:35.450
Good for me. Good for me, my friend.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.664
This is good.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.749
Well, I mean, it's really, really good.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.836
My patient used to have a restaurant
over in St. Claude.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.297
This is her family's secret recipe.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.632
Okay.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.635
So, what's the secret?

09:54.303 --> 09:55.345
I can't tell you.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.681
You can't?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.808
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.397
Wow.

10:06.398 --> 10:10.652
This woman.
Oh, bless. She's--

10:12.654 --> 10:14.239
She's a real fighter.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.537
Yeah. Just a beautiful soul.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.166
How is the new job?

10:24.249 --> 10:27.920
Is it-- Is the work,
you know, is it enough to distract you?

10:28.003 --> 10:29.087
Surgery is.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.300
But in the quiet moments…

10:34.468 --> 10:36.929
Am I, Am I worried?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.473
Yeah, of course I am.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.519
Yeah. I just wish
we knew what they were doing.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.022
Are they investigating you
or are they not, you know?

10:50.692 --> 10:51.860
Honestly, Vince…

10:54.154 --> 10:57.950
I feel like I'm about to get railroaded.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.285
Why? Why would they do that?

11:00.369 --> 11:04.289
Because everything went to shit,
and somebody's got to take the blame.

11:04.373 --> 11:10.254
Anna. Anna, do you have any idea
how highly respected you are?

11:10.337 --> 11:13.507
There's no way--
I just don't see that happening.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.176
All I did was try to help people.
That is all I did.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.762
I know that. I know you.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.974
Look, God is good, right?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.685
He's watching over us.
He's got a plan for us.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.688
The truth is gonna prevail here.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.196
I wanna believe that.
Oh, I wanna believe that. I really do.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.969
-So, you ever meet Frank Minyard before?
-No.

11:59.052 --> 12:03.056
Yeah. He wears cowboy boots,
plays jazz trumpet in the quarter.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.933
Very much larger than life.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.270
-Not your typical pathologist.
-Oh, no. He's not a pathologist.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.689
Wait, what?
So then how is he the city coroner?

12:10.772 --> 12:12.065
Well, 'cause he got elected.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.485
People love him,
so he keeps getting reelected.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.197
-So he's not an actual doctor?
-Oh, no. He is a doctor.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.365
He's a gynecologist by training.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.662
He works out of a funeral home?

12:25.746 --> 12:28.290
Yeah. They're temporary offices.
They got flooded out.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.669
Sorry, Butch. Don't mind the mess.

12:32.753 --> 12:38.842
We just-- We just had to pack up and run
when our place went underwater.

12:40.302 --> 12:42.596
-Virginia, you said?
-Yeah.

12:42.679 --> 12:47.935
So, Virginia, do you know
where the word coroner comes from?

12:48.519 --> 12:49.853
Can't say that I do.

12:50.938 --> 12:54.233
It means keeper of the pleas of the crown.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.652
That's from the Magna Carta.

12:56.735 --> 13:01.240
Back in the day, the coroners were
very important crown officials.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.784
Of course, nowadays,

13:03.867 --> 13:06.411
we're mainly relegated
to dealing with dead bodies.

13:07.538 --> 13:10.916
Which brings us to your autopsies, Butch.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.000
Have a seat.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.838
We've got a big problem.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.841
-What's that?
-I can't tell you whether murder occurred.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.427
-Well, why not?
-Because the bodies, they're useless.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.847
They-- They decomposed in the heat
for a week.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.140
We can't even get a-a decent blood sample.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.185
My understanding is that
drugs can leave traces

13:30.269 --> 13:32.437
in other hardier tissues
like the liver or the brain,

13:32.521 --> 13:34.565
or even in the fluid pooled
in the abdomen.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.109
Are you a pathologist?

13:37.985 --> 13:40.779
No, but I-I talked to one.
Well, two, actually.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.407
Oh, they haven't seen these bodies.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.202
Regardless, we need to test
these tissue samples, Frank.

13:50.706 --> 13:53.417
Now, this is coming
from the attorney general himself.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.507
All right. Fine.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.468
I'll tell him where you stand.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.598
You see what I'm dealing with here?

14:07.681 --> 14:10.267
I-- I'm, I'm beyond overloaded.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.477
But I'll tell you what,

14:13.020 --> 14:16.523
I-- I'll get
a federal disaster mortuary team out here

14:16.607 --> 14:19.193
to take those samples
and send 'em to the lab.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.486
Just for you, Butch.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.696
Thank you, Frank.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.365
Yeah, I-- It's greatly appreciated.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.996
Isn't it Minyard's job
to collect evidence?

14:31.079 --> 14:33.540
Not to arbitrarily decide
what should or shouldn't be done?

14:33.624 --> 14:35.667
Don't worry about it.
We got our tissue samples.

14:35.751 --> 14:38.504
He's the coroner.
It's not his job to arbitrate this.

14:38.587 --> 14:39.588
Look, Virginia,

14:39.671 --> 14:42.382
the medical community in this town
is a tight-knit group,

14:42.466 --> 14:44.009
and Minyard, he's part of it.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.386
He's supposed to be focused
on the evidence, period.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.889
Him and all the rest of them,
they're not going to stand by

14:48.972 --> 14:51.517
and watch this happen
to one of their own fellow doctors.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.976
You gotta be prepared for that.

15:10.786 --> 15:11.828
Hey, hon.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.414
Hey. How was your day?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.500
Oh, it was fine. Fine.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.126
Did you talk to your family today?

15:18.627 --> 15:20.838
Yeah, I chatted with my sister
for a little bit.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.340
How's your case going?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.051
Oh, nothing too exciting to report.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.471
Hey, I-I brought you your sketchpad.

15:29.555 --> 15:33.100
I thought it might inspire you
to start some new paintings,

15:33.183 --> 15:35.352
or maybe some of those angels.

15:36.061 --> 15:40.357
Thanks, Butch, but I'm just--
I'm just not feeling up to it.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.945
All right.
Well, they sell in the galleries.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.989
That's-- That's good, too, right?

15:48.657 --> 15:49.783
Maybe soon.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.328
All right.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.164
Well, I'll--
I'll go rustle us up some dinner.

16:03.714 --> 16:06.341
-There's chicken and broccoli.
-All right.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.701
-Hello?
-Hi, it's me. Guess what?

16:33.285 --> 16:36.914
Somebody from Memorial, not LifeCare,
actually wants to talk to us.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.750
Well, that's a first. Who's that?

16:45.923 --> 16:47.132
I see you found the place.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.885
-It's Arthur Schafer.
-Virginia Rider.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.846
-Bryant King. Nice to meet you both.
-Yeah. Hey.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.431
Yeah. Come on in.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.642
I reached out because
I was watching TV coverage

16:56.725 --> 16:59.019
of the mortuary workers
recovering bodies at Memorial,

16:59.102 --> 17:01.939
and I just-- just couldn't believe
the number of bodies

17:02.022 --> 17:03.315
they recovered from the chapel.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.525
Well, why is that?

17:05.192 --> 17:06.193
Because on Wednesday,

17:06.276 --> 17:09.279
I pronounced a patient dead
due to natural causes.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.492
When we carried her to the chapel,

17:13.575 --> 17:15.786
that marked the sixth patient
in that room.

17:15.868 --> 17:16.869
I took note of it.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.457
After that, no one else died
on my second-floor area

17:20.540 --> 17:22.209
before I left the hospital on Thursday.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.378
I'm willing to go to my grave on that
because I was counting in my head.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.591
I knew the total number dead
in the hospital at that point.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.260
Which was how many?

17:31.343 --> 17:34.680
On Thursday it was 20 or 21.
I'm sure of it.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.599
So when I learned that 45 bodies
were recovered in total,

17:37.683 --> 17:40.435
I was like, "There's no way
that many people died

17:40.519 --> 17:43.438
in the time frame between the time I left
and the following day."

17:44.565 --> 17:47.776
How many hospitals are losing 20 patients
in one day?

17:47.860 --> 17:51.405
Well, some might suggest
it was 'cause of the horrible conditions.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.657
You know,
the lack of power, the extreme heat.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.452
People don't die that often in hospitals,
even under adverse circumstances.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.204
That wasn't it.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.707
So, then what was it?

18:04.376 --> 18:06.003
I knew something was happening.

18:07.754 --> 18:13.468
I was speaking to Kathleen Fournier.
We went to medical school together.

18:13.552 --> 18:14.970
What were they saying?

18:16.638 --> 18:18.056
I'm not exactly sure.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.642
All right,
what do you think they were saying?

18:22.519 --> 18:24.980
This is between me, you,
and the fence post, okay?

18:26.607 --> 18:29.943
They were talking about how
we're not gonna get everybody out of here,

18:30.444 --> 18:35.741
and how patients are suffering, and we
have to find a way to end that suffering.

18:37.868 --> 18:41.663
If there are patients who are in pain,
we got to do everything we can to help.

18:41.747 --> 18:44.082
That's not what they were talking about.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.211
Just-- Just comfort, you know?

18:47.294 --> 18:50.047
-I really don't think they were.
-Wait, who is "they"?

18:50.631 --> 18:54.343
Ewing Cook and Anna Pou. They were
talking about ending patient suffering.

18:54.426 --> 18:55.928
And I heard Anna say,

18:56.011 --> 18:59.056
"Oh, yeah.
I don't have a problem with that."

18:59.890 --> 19:00.933
What?

19:01.016 --> 19:03.101
And I'm thinking in my mind,

19:03.185 --> 19:06.104
"That's not normal.
That's not what we're paid to do.

19:06.188 --> 19:09.816
We're paid to care for people,
to help people."

19:10.317 --> 19:13.028
So you knew what she meant,
but you didn't question it?

19:13.612 --> 19:15.030
You gotta understand.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.449
I was one of the only Black doctors
in that hospital.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.076
I was only recently hired.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.875
Some people were afraid of people
outside of the hospital, but for me…

19:27.501 --> 19:28.669
It was the other way around.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.921
You were afraid of the people
in the hospital?

19:31.922 --> 19:33.131
Let me put it this way.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.218
The stories going around
about how there were looters,

19:36.301 --> 19:38.178
rapists and snipers roaming the city,

19:38.971 --> 19:41.056
how New Orleans
was under the control of criminals,

19:41.139 --> 19:43.475
what they really were referring to
were Black folks.

19:43.559 --> 19:46.019
I saw this on the ER ramp

19:46.103 --> 19:48.647
when people with my same skin color
were being turned away.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.482
I tried to help 'em.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.652
Hey! What's going on?
Why aren't we helping these people?

19:54.236 --> 19:56.154
We ain't got no room for these people.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.574
What? We're not gonna help 'em at all?

19:59.491 --> 20:01.368
When I saw what was happening,

20:01.451 --> 20:04.288
I was, like, "Man,
there's only so much I can do or say."

20:06.707 --> 20:08.125
They had all the guns.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.295
-You were afraid of being shot.
-Not so much that.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.755
I don't think they would have shot me
in front of everybody,

20:13.839 --> 20:15.257
but they damn sure would have removed me.

20:18.802 --> 20:23.098
I'm a person who speaks his mind,
but I also know when to shut my mouth.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.655
But I quietly let people know
what was going on.

20:40.324 --> 20:41.450
How'd you do that?

20:47.414 --> 20:48.957
I sent some text messages.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.335
To whom?

20:51.418 --> 20:52.920
My best friend, for one.

20:53.587 --> 20:56.089
I told him there were evil entities
inside the hospital

20:56.173 --> 20:57.841
planning to euthanize patients.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.678
-Evil entities?
-I can't call 'em people anymore.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.932
When you're talking about killing people
who've done nothing wrong.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.060
Innocent people?

21:11.063 --> 21:12.481
Humans don't do that to one another.

21:12.564 --> 21:16.527
I was like, "These-- These-- These--"
the correct word is motherfuckers,

21:16.610 --> 21:18.111
"…are talking about killing people."

21:19.780 --> 21:23.450
Wait, did-- did you directly see
anything related to that?

21:27.871 --> 21:30.707
My last day on the second floor,
this guy comes up to me.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.418
A nurse's aide, I think,
and he says to me…

21:33.502 --> 21:34.711
Dr. King.

21:36.630 --> 21:39.383
-Would you like to join us in a prayer?
-A prayer?

21:40.342 --> 21:45.097
And when he says this,
I'm thinking, "What is this?"

21:45.764 --> 21:47.307
And then I see Anna Pou.

21:47.808 --> 21:51.979
She was holding a handful
of 10cc syringes with the pink needle.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.565
Why did she have all those needles?

21:56.900 --> 22:00.195
Did you see Dr. Pou inject
any of the patients?

22:06.451 --> 22:10.038
No. But here she is
holding a handful of syringes,

22:10.122 --> 22:12.666
and people are saying things
they shouldn't--

22:12.749 --> 22:15.252
They're saying things
they shouldn't even be thinking.

22:15.335 --> 22:18.714
I said to myself,
"This is not a normal situation.

22:18.797 --> 22:20.424
I probably shouldn't be here.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.512
I can't be a part of this."

22:29.725 --> 22:30.976
Where you going?

22:33.312 --> 22:34.396
I'm getting out of here.

22:35.439 --> 22:38.775
-You're going to abandon us?
-Do you know what's going on here?

22:38.859 --> 22:41.195
Maybe you can work that shit out
in your head.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.780
I can't. I can't even stop 'em.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.868
They're the ones with the guns.
They're the ones with the power.

22:53.207 --> 22:54.833
So that's when you left?

22:56.126 --> 22:57.169
I got on a boat.

22:58.212 --> 23:00.547
Got dropped off, waded to dry land,

23:00.631 --> 23:03.133
and hiked all the way back up here
to my house.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.639
Have you talked to anybody else
about any of this?

23:10.641 --> 23:12.017
We begin at a moment

23:12.100 --> 23:15.771
when Hurricane Katrina
went from being a disaster to a tragedy.

23:15.854 --> 23:19.775
When people began making choices
that leave a mark on the soul.

23:19.858 --> 23:23.320
Now, as the water and the mud recede,
secrets are coming to light.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.031
Whispers of life and death decisions

23:26.114 --> 23:30.702
and talk heard here for the first time
anywhere of more, of mercy killings.

23:30.786 --> 23:34.498
There are new questions about
whether the staff at a flooded hospital

23:34.581 --> 23:36.750
once talked about euthanizing patients.

23:36.834 --> 23:41.129
Was euthanasia enacted in that hospital
in the days after Katrina

23:41.213 --> 23:45.467
when there was so much chaos
going on in this city?

23:45.551 --> 23:50.138
Most people know that something happened
that shouldn't have happened.

23:50.222 --> 23:53.475
One of the other physicians,
she had a handful of syringes.

23:53.559 --> 23:55.602
Now,
I don't know what was in the syringes.

23:55.686 --> 23:58.730
I don't know--
And the only thing I heard her say is,

23:58.814 --> 24:00.899
"I'm gonna give you something
to make you feel better."

24:00.983 --> 24:03.944
Oh, God. I don't believe this.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.904
I sympathize with his concern.

24:06.864 --> 24:09.741
But he's gonna destroy the reputation

24:09.825 --> 24:12.452
of every doctor
that's ever worked at that hospital.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.872
Horace, you're overreacting.

24:14.955 --> 24:17.249
Well, I don't think I am.

24:17.749 --> 24:21.044
I mean,
if he-- what he says is really true,

24:21.128 --> 24:23.255
then it's beyond horrendous.

24:23.797 --> 24:29.887
But this is not something that you air
in the court of public opinion.

24:29.970 --> 24:31.805
The doctor who King alleges
held the syringes

24:31.889 --> 24:34.725
spoke by phone with the media
on several occasions.

24:34.808 --> 24:38.854
And emphasized that everyone
inside the hospital felt abandoned.

24:38.937 --> 24:40.439
The doctor said, quote,

24:40.522 --> 24:43.400
"We did everything humanly possible
to save these patients.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.153
The government totally abandoned us to die

24:46.236 --> 24:49.698
in the houses, in the streets,
in the hospitals.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.742
Maybe a lot of us made mistakes,

24:51.825 --> 24:54.369
but we made the best decisions
we could at the time."

24:54.453 --> 24:58.874
Our coverage of these events will continue
as more information becomes available.

25:04.588 --> 25:07.716
So, Ms. Isbell, you were
the nursing director for LifeCare, right?

25:07.799 --> 25:08.800
Correct.

25:09.635 --> 25:12.721
So, on Thursday, September 1st,

25:13.764 --> 25:16.016
when three medical professionals
from Memorial

25:16.099 --> 25:17.518
showed up on the seventh floor…

25:17.601 --> 25:19.394
What did you think was happening?

25:20.103 --> 25:22.814
I assumed they were there
to take care of our patients.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.608
Why else would they come up there?

25:26.109 --> 25:28.070
Well, that's what I'm asking you.

25:28.862 --> 25:31.949
Well, if it was something different,
I honestly don't know.

25:33.617 --> 25:36.245
During the disaster,
did you keep up your charts?

25:36.745 --> 25:38.580
Record which drugs
you were giving to your patients?

25:39.706 --> 25:42.084
We kept 'em up as long as we could.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.754
There was no way
we could keep track of everything.

25:45.838 --> 25:48.590
Yeah, I've been up on that seventh floor.
I can imagine what you went through.

25:48.674 --> 25:50.342
Oh, no. You cannot imagine.

25:51.385 --> 25:52.594
You have no idea.

25:54.555 --> 25:58.058
We tried so hard to keep them all alive.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.479
I wanna know why did it take so long

26:02.563 --> 26:05.816
for someone to come help us
to get those patients out?

26:06.859 --> 26:09.194
That's why we lost so many patients.

26:10.737 --> 26:14.283
Where was the government?
Where was our help?

26:14.366 --> 26:15.826
-Ms. Isbell--
-No.

26:16.535 --> 26:18.912
You leave the people
that stayed and worked through the storm,

26:18.996 --> 26:20.581
you leave them alone.

26:20.664 --> 26:24.626
You let the doctors and the nurses
who stayed to take care of their patients,

26:24.710 --> 26:28.297
to try and take their suffering away,
you just let them be what they are.

26:28.964 --> 26:30.132
Heroes.

26:32.426 --> 26:34.094
If you want, we can take a break.

26:34.178 --> 26:36.680
Take a break? From this?

26:37.890 --> 26:39.183
This is nothing.

26:39.850 --> 26:41.560
When I'm at home, I can't sleep.

26:42.603 --> 26:45.397
I have nightmares
where I see the faces of my patients.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.942
I feel guilty
when I think of the staff that I picked

26:49.026 --> 26:50.569
to work during the hurricane.

26:55.073 --> 26:58.994
I feel the pain
of every single patient's death.

27:01.038 --> 27:03.498
I know this is hard,
but we do appreciate it.

27:05.501 --> 27:09.922
How dare you come here
from a place of comfort

27:11.423 --> 27:14.134
and try to decide
what was right and what was wrong?

27:19.431 --> 27:21.225
What you're doing is not fair.

27:23.769 --> 27:25.103
It's just not.

27:26.563 --> 27:30.234
Sorry, but it just isn't.

27:36.031 --> 27:37.866
Walker, you wanted to see me?

27:37.950 --> 27:39.117
Anna, come on in.

27:40.327 --> 27:41.453
What's going on?

27:42.329 --> 27:44.540
You know,
we are so blessed to have you here.

27:44.623 --> 27:48.752
So blessed. You know that.
But…

27:48.836 --> 27:53.048
I'm sure you've seen the coverage
on CNN, elsewhere.

27:54.216 --> 27:55.425
Yeah, I'm aware of it.

27:55.509 --> 27:59.763
But you know,
I'm busy taking care of my patients,

27:59.847 --> 28:01.682
not sitting around watching TV news.

28:02.391 --> 28:05.602
Right. Well, given that some
of that coverage focused on you,

28:06.478 --> 28:08.188
we've had to think through this
a little bit.

28:09.439 --> 28:13.694
For example, what happens if,
an operation goes badly?

28:13.777 --> 28:17.489
Through no fault of your own.
But they can. They do. You know.

28:17.573 --> 28:20.075
Walker, what are you saying?
Just come out and say it.

28:21.451 --> 28:26.039
We would like you to consider
taking a pause from performing surgery.

28:26.707 --> 28:28.417
Look, if something unexpected happened…

28:28.500 --> 28:30.836
it would be devastating
for the university.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.254
You know, so…

28:32.880 --> 28:35.257
You want me to stop performing surgery?

28:35.340 --> 28:37.843
We are just asking that you consider it.

28:40.888 --> 28:44.224
I can still see all my patients
and still have all my hospital privileges.

28:44.308 --> 28:47.144
Right, you're just not gonna
be doing surgery for a little while.

28:47.227 --> 28:49.438
It's killing me,
but that's what we agreed.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.815
I think that's her right? That Pou woman.

28:51.899 --> 28:53.275
Yeah.

28:54.735 --> 28:57.279
Do you see that?
I think they're talking about us.

29:01.241 --> 29:03.660
Well, okay, maybe. So what?

29:03.744 --> 29:05.454
Yeah, I guess it is what it is.

29:06.997 --> 29:10.334
Oh, hey,
did I tell you about Michael Young?

29:11.376 --> 29:14.796
So Michael is playing golf
with a guy over in Covington,

29:14.880 --> 29:17.424
and the guy, he hits a bird.

29:17.508 --> 29:20.135
He hits a bird in mid-flight, all right?

29:20.636 --> 29:21.762
And now, the bird's fine…

29:21.845 --> 29:24.139
She was over, at, Memorial…

29:26.391 --> 29:29.311
All right. You want me to go over there
and intimidate 'em?

29:30.687 --> 29:32.022
What?

29:32.105 --> 29:33.482
That would be very effective.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.692
Yeah. They're two old ladies.

29:35.776 --> 29:37.486
I think I could do it.

29:38.570 --> 29:41.281
-You don't think I could?
-I just wanna-- I wanna go home.

29:41.365 --> 29:44.243
-Really?
-Anna. Anna?

29:45.369 --> 29:46.662
-Sorry.
-Oh, Laura.

29:46.745 --> 29:48.288
-Hi. How are you?
-Oh, hey.

29:48.372 --> 29:51.041
Hi, Laura. Hi.

29:51.124 --> 29:53.836
Henry and I, we just wanted to say
that we're with you.

29:53.919 --> 29:57.089
We're thinking of you.
We're sending you our prayers.

29:58.006 --> 30:00.884
What's happening
to you is just-- It's so unfair.

30:01.635 --> 30:03.136
I'm not going to argue that.

30:03.220 --> 30:05.514
Anything we can do to help you,
you just let us know.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.975
Thank you, Laura. Thank you.
I appreciate that.

30:08.058 --> 30:09.685
-Thank you very much.
-You take care.

30:09.768 --> 30:11.603
-But I will be checking in with you.
-Thank you.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.021
Thank you.

30:21.154 --> 30:24.032
That's not--
That's not Christian of her…

30:38.630 --> 30:39.756
Reinforcements.

30:40.549 --> 30:41.758
That's so nice. Thanks.

30:42.676 --> 30:44.219
You wanna know my fun fact for the day?

30:44.303 --> 30:47.181
Well, it's only 8:00 a.m.
You sure you're not gonna top yourself?

30:47.264 --> 30:49.266
-Not a chance.
-All right.

30:49.349 --> 30:52.186
So you know Pou's brother, Fredrick?
Pou's one of 11 children, by the way.

30:52.269 --> 30:53.270
I knew that.

30:54.396 --> 30:55.898
He's a federal drug fugitive.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.943
He is an all-star
on the DEA's most-wanted list.

31:00.027 --> 31:03.322
It's official now.
Everything in this case is batshit crazy.

31:03.405 --> 31:07.743
Well, my morning news is less colorful,
but we got the toxicology reports.

31:07.826 --> 31:08.952
And?

31:09.036 --> 31:13.290
They tested tissue samples
in 18 of the dead patients from Memorial.

31:13.373 --> 31:16.752
Nine of those 18 tested positive
for morphine,

31:16.835 --> 31:20.631
and seven of those nine
also tested positive for midazolam,

31:20.714 --> 31:22.341
aka Versed.

31:23.175 --> 31:26.386
That is the exact combination of drugs
that Nakamaru said he gave to Pou.

31:26.470 --> 31:27.596
Yeah, the lab director said

31:27.679 --> 31:30.641
finding midazolam
in these bodies was disconcerting.

31:30.724 --> 31:34.144
Of course it is. In my opinion,
there's no way to justify it,

31:34.228 --> 31:35.979
other than
when you combine it with morphine,

31:36.063 --> 31:37.981
it's a highly effective way
to kill people.

31:38.065 --> 31:40.442
Now these reports,
they're helpful, for sure.

31:40.526 --> 31:43.779
But the defense is gonna go after
the conditions of the bodies.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.490
Right?
How none of this evidence is reliable.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.283
How do we counter that?

31:48.367 --> 31:52.162
We gotta get some other eyes on this,
right? Some expert opinions.

31:52.246 --> 31:55.082
We're gonna get all this
to some top pathologists.

31:56.542 --> 32:00.045
Anna, I'm afraid we're going to need
to start preparing our defense.

32:00.921 --> 32:02.422
What are you hearing?

32:02.506 --> 32:05.509
Well, unfortunately,
the internal chatter is that,

32:05.592 --> 32:08.846
the attorney general's office
is focusing their investigation on you.

32:11.098 --> 32:12.432
Oh, my God.

32:13.934 --> 32:15.310
Oh, my God.

32:16.895 --> 32:21.483
Anna? Anna, it--
It's gonna be okay. Listen to me.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.944
We're gonna rally
every medical professional

32:24.027 --> 32:25.654
in this city behind you.

32:26.572 --> 32:27.865
Otherwise, next time there's a hurricane,

32:27.948 --> 32:30.868
there won't be a single doctor
in this city practicing medicine.

32:30.951 --> 32:32.411
The public needs to know that.

32:35.706 --> 32:36.957
So what do we do?

32:37.749 --> 32:41.128
Well, first thing I want to do is
put together a field trip of sorts.

32:41.211 --> 32:42.212
-Field trip?
-Yeah.

32:42.296 --> 32:45.966
You, me, and the two nurses
who were with you on that last day.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.094
I want us all to go back to Memorial.

32:49.178 --> 32:51.430
You wanna go back to the hospital?
What for?

32:51.513 --> 32:54.641
Because I want y'all to walk me through
everything that happened on that last day,

32:55.642 --> 32:57.519
make sure we're all on the same page.

33:05.027 --> 33:07.154
You know, personally,
I would never want to be euthanized,

33:07.237 --> 33:09.573
but I get why some people
in horrible conditions would.

33:09.656 --> 33:11.158
Yeah. I mean, I'm a Catholic.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.994
It's against my religion,
but if I'm a vegetable,

33:14.077 --> 33:15.287
pull the plug on me.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.872
If that's your choice, I'm good with that.

33:16.955 --> 33:19.625
But at Memorial, as far as I know,
nobody got consent.

33:20.167 --> 33:23.170
Yeah, that's exactly right.
Nobody got consent.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.089
What does Linda think about all this?

33:27.174 --> 33:30.427
-Oh, we don't talk about my case work.
-Really? Never?

33:31.261 --> 33:32.429
Not really.

33:32.513 --> 33:33.680
Well, why is that?

33:34.431 --> 33:36.558
Well, first of all,
you don't want your secrets

33:36.642 --> 33:38.977
getting passed on to the grocer
or whomever.

33:39.061 --> 33:40.938
Who tells secrets to their grocer?

33:41.021 --> 33:42.439
It's not 1955.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.110
You know, if Linda saw that I was
that caught up in something,

33:47.194 --> 33:48.362
she'd worry for me,

33:49.446 --> 33:52.783
that I was working too hard,
or if I injured my health.

33:54.201 --> 33:55.702
Especially now, she doesn't need that.

33:57.704 --> 33:58.872
How is she doing?

34:01.708 --> 34:03.544
You know, it wasn't just our daughter.

34:04.837 --> 34:05.838
In the last five months,

34:05.921 --> 34:09.299
she's also lost her father and her cousin
who was like a sister to her.

34:10.592 --> 34:11.677
It's been brutal.

34:11.760 --> 34:14.721
Oh, my God.
I can't even imagine. I'm so sorry.

34:15.347 --> 34:17.641
Yeah, she's grieving in her own way.

34:17.724 --> 34:21.228
And I'm just giving her the space
to do it.

34:22.980 --> 34:25.440
How's-- how's Kevin managing all this?

34:27.943 --> 34:29.277
To be honest,

34:29.360 --> 34:31.362
things between us are not so great
right now.

34:31.446 --> 34:34.324
So, it's good for me to have this case
to focus on.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.369
All right.
As long as you keep it all in perspective.

34:37.452 --> 34:40.205
I see how hard you're working.
You're like a human 7-Eleven.

34:41.373 --> 34:42.541
Human 7-Eleven.

34:43.876 --> 34:46.003
Well, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me, Butch.

34:47.254 --> 34:49.630
I mean, I'm just-- I'm--
I'm worried about you.

34:49.715 --> 34:52.050
-No, I'm worried about you.
-No, I'm the more worried person.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.011
No, I don't think so.
I am much more worried.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.389
All right, I concede.

34:58.473 --> 35:01.894
Look, I got to go run some errands.
I'll meet you back at the office, yeah?

35:01.977 --> 35:03.061
-Okay.
-All right.

35:14.323 --> 35:15.407
Miss Rider.

35:16.366 --> 35:17.367
Mrs. Everett?

35:17.451 --> 35:20.162
I'm sorry to just show up on you
like this,

35:21.038 --> 35:23.332
but I need to know what you're doing
on behalf of my Emmett.

35:24.124 --> 35:26.877
We're working on it. I promise you.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.004
So you're making progress?

35:29.087 --> 35:30.881
Yes, we are.

35:32.341 --> 35:35.219
You know, there's a whole lot
of powerful people out there

35:36.053 --> 35:39.223
who want this whole thing to just go away.

35:41.308 --> 35:42.768
You can't let that happen.

35:43.810 --> 35:44.895
I'm not going to.

35:49.608 --> 35:50.734
I got you something.

35:52.819 --> 35:56.657
After all the flooding,
it's the only one I got left.

35:59.034 --> 36:00.369
I want you to have it.

36:02.162 --> 36:03.539
No. No, I-I can't.

36:03.622 --> 36:07.167
Take it. Please.

36:10.420 --> 36:12.548
I want you to know something,
Mrs. Everett.

36:13.590 --> 36:16.051
Emmett is the poster child for our case.

36:17.427 --> 36:21.473
We're doing everything we can
to get justice for him, for what happened.

36:27.980 --> 36:31.775
I miss him so much.

36:34.444 --> 36:35.445
It hurts.

36:38.031 --> 36:43.495
Nobody has the right to play God
and end a life.

36:44.746 --> 36:45.914
They just don't.

36:47.165 --> 36:48.750
I don't care who they are.

36:59.553 --> 37:02.931
Thank you for your time.

37:22.367 --> 37:24.286
Mr. Nakamaru, thank you for coming.

37:24.369 --> 37:25.913
So what we'd like you to do is

37:25.996 --> 37:29.791
verify the remaining stockpile of drugs
in the pharmacy.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.001
All right.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.478
The morphine, the Versed and the Ativan,
it's all missing.

37:50.062 --> 37:53.273
-What about the other controlled drugs?
-Still here.

37:54.149 --> 37:57.277
Were there any records
of who raided the pharmacy?

38:00.072 --> 38:01.073
Yes.

38:02.241 --> 38:05.118
Here's the list of the last people
to sign out the medications.

38:06.245 --> 38:08.330
can you confirm whose signature this is?

38:08.413 --> 38:10.165
Anna Pou. Yes.

38:10.958 --> 38:13.627
She was the last person
to sign out medications.

38:25.013 --> 38:26.265
Oh, my God.

38:28.141 --> 38:29.935
I can't imagine
what you all went through here.

38:33.814 --> 38:35.148
It was our job.

38:35.774 --> 38:36.984
You all okay?

38:37.985 --> 38:39.778
-I just--
-Goddamn.

38:50.205 --> 38:55.669
Oh, you know, seeing it now--
It's, It looks so much worse.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.385
What do you want me to show you?

39:08.849 --> 39:10.267
All of it.

39:10.350 --> 39:13.187
Just-- Just tell us what you did.

39:14.021 --> 39:15.981
How you helped people.
How you saved people.

39:21.445 --> 39:24.615
All of the patients
who went by helicopter came this way.

39:25.157 --> 39:26.867
Down the hospital stairs,

39:26.950 --> 39:29.494
through that hole,
up the ramp to these stairs.

39:30.704 --> 39:32.456
It's just incredible.

39:34.750 --> 39:37.503
Did the patients make the climb themselves
or were they carried?

39:37.586 --> 39:39.880
Most of them were too sick.
They had to be carried.

39:39.963 --> 39:41.089
It was--

39:41.173 --> 39:43.258
It's Herculean. Yes, that's what it was.

39:47.638 --> 39:49.264
-This is the landing pad.
-Yeah.

39:49.348 --> 39:50.724
Wasn't used for decades.

39:50.807 --> 39:52.559
It's in bad shape, isn't it?

39:59.107 --> 40:00.901
Guess you'd call this ground zero.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.614
That's the chapel.

40:06.323 --> 40:07.533
I'm sure you know that.

40:08.408 --> 40:09.785
Yeah.

40:10.369 --> 40:11.370
What happened here is

40:11.453 --> 40:14.623
something no human being
should ever have to experience.

40:17.292 --> 40:18.293
What the--

40:19.378 --> 40:21.296
Nobody else is supposed to be in here.

40:21.922 --> 40:23.131
That's Dr. Pou.

40:24.049 --> 40:25.050
That's Anna Pou?

40:25.133 --> 40:27.928
And the two nurses. The ones
she brought up to the seventh floor.

40:28.011 --> 40:30.180
Holy shit. You're kidding me.

40:32.599 --> 40:33.684
Dr. Pou.

40:39.773 --> 40:40.774
Yes?

40:41.650 --> 40:43.777
I'm Virginia Rider.
This is Arthur Schafer.

40:44.278 --> 40:46.947
We're with the Louisiana State
Attorney General's office.

40:51.618 --> 40:52.703
Hello, Anna.

40:53.370 --> 40:56.999
And, I'm Rick Simmons,
Dr. Pou's attorney.

40:59.293 --> 41:02.504
-Mr. Simmons, we should--
-Oh, yeah-- yeah…

41:03.172 --> 41:05.215
If you'll excuse us. Anna.

41:14.141 --> 41:16.393
I can't fucking believe
that just happened.

41:19.980 --> 41:21.148
What are they doing here?

41:21.231 --> 41:23.775
Same as us.
Getting their ducks in a row.

41:23.859 --> 41:25.068
Don't worry about it.

41:26.528 --> 41:27.988
Anna. Anna. Hey.

41:28.864 --> 41:32.159
Listen, we're-- we're gonna focus
right now on what we're doing.

41:33.118 --> 41:35.037
Forget about them, all right?

41:35.120 --> 41:37.414
Come on, now.
Let's go finish our tour. Let's go.

41:45.005 --> 41:46.131
This is Arthur Schafer.

41:46.215 --> 41:48.842
Mr. Schafer?
This is Mike Murphy with LifeCare.

41:48.926 --> 41:50.010
How you doing today?

41:50.594 --> 41:52.387
-Fine. Thanks.
-Good.

41:52.471 --> 41:55.390
So, Kristy Johnson,
our physical medicine director,

41:55.474 --> 41:56.934
you-- you met her.

41:57.017 --> 41:59.436
-Yeah, I remember.
-Yeah, she…

41:59.520 --> 42:01.522
she's got something more
she wants to tell you.

42:01.605 --> 42:03.440
She wants to come talk to you again.

42:03.524 --> 42:05.234
All right. Well, we'll set it up.

42:23.418 --> 42:24.419
Hello, Walker.

42:25.337 --> 42:26.338
Anna.

42:34.012 --> 42:35.889
I wanna get back to work.

42:37.182 --> 42:38.267
I appreciate that.

42:39.393 --> 42:42.646
But you know as well as I do
that hospitals are giant bureaucracies,

42:42.729 --> 42:44.398
and the wheels turn slowly.

42:47.484 --> 42:48.819
I thought you were in charge.

43:02.666 --> 43:05.586
My patients, they need surgeries.

43:06.170 --> 43:08.881
It's not like there are dozens
of otolaryngologists sitting around

43:08.964 --> 43:10.048
like cans of corn.

43:10.132 --> 43:11.216
I realize that.

43:12.426 --> 43:15.053
You know,
I haven't even been charged with a crime.

43:15.137 --> 43:16.680
Oh, I realize that too.

43:27.316 --> 43:28.817
I'm wondering,

43:28.901 --> 43:31.904
have you ever read
LSU Healthcare Center's mission statement?

43:35.490 --> 43:39.453
Because it talks about
how patient-centered health care delivered

43:39.536 --> 43:42.623
with the highest quality
of professionalism is cornerstone--

43:42.706 --> 43:45.292
I've read it. I wrote it.

43:49.671 --> 43:51.423
-Nicely worded.
-Thank you.

43:53.383 --> 43:57.471
All right, let me…
Let me see what I can do

43:57.554 --> 43:59.556
about getting you back
in the operating room.

44:00.557 --> 44:01.725
Thank you, Walker.

44:03.435 --> 44:04.436
Thank you.

44:19.701 --> 44:22.538
Am I the only outside doctor
who's examined the evidence?

44:22.621 --> 44:25.499
Oh, no, sir. We sent it to a whole panel
of outside experts.

44:25.582 --> 44:28.669
So in your opinion, Dr. Baden,
where's the evidence point?

44:28.752 --> 44:30.003
Homicide.

44:30.087 --> 44:31.922
-In all the cases you reviewed?
-Yes.

44:32.005 --> 44:34.383
-Even with the conditions of the bodies?
-Yes.

44:34.466 --> 44:38.929
In all the nine cases I reviewed,
I would categorize them all as homicides.

44:39.638 --> 44:41.265
Well, thank you very much for your time,
Doctor.

44:41.348 --> 44:42.432
Thank you.

44:48.188 --> 44:49.523
Kristy Johnson is here.

44:51.358 --> 44:54.361
I went with Dr. Pou to the entrance
of Emmett Everett's room.

44:55.445 --> 44:58.782
You know who I'm talking about, right?
He was a conscious patient.

44:58.866 --> 45:00.534
Yeah, we know about Emmett Everett. Yes.

45:01.785 --> 45:03.537
She told me she planned
to give him something.

45:05.289 --> 45:07.124
I wanna tell him that I'm--

45:07.207 --> 45:10.460
I wanna give him something
to help him with his dizziness.

45:10.544 --> 45:11.712
What do you think?

45:14.506 --> 45:16.800
I don't know. I guess.

45:17.467 --> 45:20.012
You gonna be okay?
You want me to go in with you?

45:20.095 --> 45:22.472
No, no. I'm okay.

45:31.857 --> 45:34.026
Emmett Everett wasn't the only one.

45:34.943 --> 45:38.405
I took Dr. Pou and the two nurses
to other bedsides.

45:39.990 --> 45:42.701
I was with them
when they injected the patients.

45:47.998 --> 45:49.166
I held their hands.

45:50.167 --> 45:51.293
I said prayers.

45:54.546 --> 45:57.257
So you personally witnessed Dr. Pou
inject patients?

45:58.300 --> 45:59.301
Yes.

46:01.762 --> 46:03.055
Do you remember which ones?

46:04.556 --> 46:05.766
Wilda McManus was one.

46:07.059 --> 46:08.810
You saw her inject Wilda McManus?

46:10.479 --> 46:11.480
Yes.

46:11.563 --> 46:14.358
-And you can testify to that?
-Yes, I can.

46:16.693 --> 46:20.781
And when I was leaving
down the hallway, I heard her, Dr. Pou.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.827
She could've been talking
about Mr. Alford,

46:26.495 --> 46:28.830
but I think she was talking
about Miss McManus,

46:28.914 --> 46:30.123
and she said…

46:32.709 --> 46:34.753
"You know, I had to give her three doses.

46:35.796 --> 46:37.464
She was really fighting."

46:39.216 --> 46:40.384
Something like that.

46:41.552 --> 46:43.637
I'm sorry it took me so long
to tell you all this.

46:43.720 --> 46:47.641
It's just-- It's just so hard.

46:56.191 --> 46:58.694
-Can I get some air?
-Yeah, of course.

47:24.428 --> 47:27.681
I just briefed the attorney general.
He wants to make the arrests.

47:28.307 --> 47:30.184
There's always more
that we can do

47:30.267 --> 47:32.019
but he doesn't want to
wait around any longer.

47:32.102 --> 47:33.687
The opinions are already turning.

47:33.770 --> 47:34.771
Wait, meaning what?

47:35.355 --> 47:36.565
Well, just the whole medical system.

47:36.648 --> 47:39.026
Doctors protect doctors.
Nurses protect nurses.

47:39.109 --> 47:40.652
You're about to see the whole thing
on display.

47:40.736 --> 47:42.696
Well, Anna Pou doesn't deserve
any special treatment.

47:42.779 --> 47:44.448
But that doesn't mean
she's not gonna get it.

47:44.531 --> 47:47.326
No, you'll see.
We're about to poke the bear.

47:47.910 --> 47:48.911
Yes, sir. Will do.

47:48.994 --> 47:51.872
Now, I'm going with the teams
for Landry and Budo. You got Pou.

47:53.832 --> 47:54.833
You ready?

47:55.667 --> 47:56.668
Yeah.

48:12.893 --> 48:14.770
Every time I make an arrest, I think,

48:15.646 --> 48:18.565
"When I knock on that door,
I'm changing someone's life forever."

48:19.691 --> 48:21.568
But last night, I slept like a baby.

48:23.904 --> 48:26.156
See you on the other side. Bye.

48:26.865 --> 48:28.867
-Let's go.
-All right. Pull out.

48:35.457 --> 48:37.793
Louisiana state agents! Open the door!

48:53.433 --> 48:55.352
State agents! Open the door!

49:00.023 --> 49:01.024
Anna Pou?

49:01.817 --> 49:03.694
Yes, I'm Anna Pou.

49:03.777 --> 49:05.195
We have a warrant for your arrest

49:05.279 --> 49:07.030
on four counts of second-degree murder.

49:07.531 --> 49:10.200
Do you have any weapons
in your possession or in your house?

49:10.284 --> 49:11.326
No.

49:11.410 --> 49:13.078
I'm gonna have to pat you down.

49:19.042 --> 49:20.878
-Is there anyone else in the house?
-No.

49:22.713 --> 49:23.964
Where are you taking me?

49:24.673 --> 49:27.801
Here in Baton Rouge for booking,
then on to jail in New Orleans.

49:28.969 --> 49:31.388
What about my patients?
I have critical care patients.

49:31.471 --> 49:33.140
I can't just leave them.

49:33.223 --> 49:35.184
I'm waiting
on some very important lab results.

49:35.267 --> 49:36.810
Are there other doctors who can cover you?

49:36.894 --> 49:37.895
Yes. But I--

49:37.978 --> 49:39.813
Then we'll give you a chance to call them.

49:44.735 --> 49:48.030
I just spent all day in surgery.
Can I at least change my clothes?

49:50.240 --> 49:51.241
Sure.

50:04.004 --> 50:06.632
You have to stand right here?
Can't you just wait outside?

50:07.341 --> 50:08.884
No, ma'am. I can't.

50:23.357 --> 50:26.235
Take off any jewelry
and bring only your driver's license.

50:27.027 --> 50:29.530
I'm not wearing any jewelry,
and my driver's license is in--

50:29.613 --> 50:31.031
Hey. Do not reach in there.

50:38.497 --> 50:39.498
Your license?

50:40.123 --> 50:41.291
It's in my wallet.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.969
All right. I'm gonna read you your rights.

50:52.970 --> 50:54.179
You have the right to remain silent.

50:54.263 --> 50:57.057
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.475
You have the right to an attorney.

50:58.559 --> 51:01.186
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

51:01.270 --> 51:04.022
I need you to sign this form saying
you understand these rights.

51:26.587 --> 51:28.463
Are you willing to answer questions
without a lawyer?

51:28.547 --> 51:29.631
No.

51:49.943 --> 51:51.403
Back door's opening…

52:13.675 --> 52:14.885
Dear God…

52:16.428 --> 52:20.182
Guide us an-- and stand beside us.

52:22.184 --> 52:25.854
Help others to not believe in falsehoods.

52:28.315 --> 52:31.485
Help those that are aligned against us
to know the truth.

52:32.528 --> 52:36.198
Please, oh, Lord, shelter and sustain us.

52:37.658 --> 52:42.454
Strengthen us to endure these hardships

52:43.539 --> 52:44.831
and injustices.

52:46.792 --> 52:51.380
Lead us back
into your everlasting goodness and light.

52:54.633 --> 52:55.634
Amen.

52:57.177 --> 52:58.178
Amen.
