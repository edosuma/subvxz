WEBVTT

00:15.367 --> 00:17.037
(dramatic music)

00:17.037 --> 00:20.528
- [Woman] Hearing about this
incident in the community

00:20.528 --> 00:22.516
it really triggered something in me

00:22.516 --> 00:24.253
and made me wanna reach out

00:24.253 --> 00:26.940
and give support to the community

00:26.940 --> 00:29.568
and give support for Theo's family.

00:29.568 --> 00:33.030
And to honor them and raise awareness

00:33.030 --> 00:35.285
about this issue that is going on

00:35.285 --> 00:39.414
since suicide is so
prominent in Utah currently.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.686
And it's a very important issue

00:41.686 --> 00:45.254
that we need to bring awareness to.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.441
- [Woman] There are so
many important topics

00:47.441 --> 00:51.191
on the news these days
suicide, rape culture.

00:52.447 --> 00:56.238
How does this event fit into the direction

00:56.238 --> 00:58.027
you think Utah is going?

00:58.027 --> 01:00.116
- [Man] Hopefully this
will bring awareness

01:00.116 --> 01:04.593
but it's a shame that it
took a politician's daughter

01:04.593 --> 01:07.260
to, for a change to make happen.

01:18.491 --> 01:21.158
(siren roaring)

01:23.473 --> 01:27.223
- [Deputy Nitrah] (mumbles).

01:35.079 --> 01:36.368
Hey folks.
- Nice to meet you.

01:36.368 --> 01:37.201
- I'm Sheriff Pershing.

01:37.201 --> 01:38.161
- Thanks for coming so quick.

01:38.161 --> 01:39.516
- This is Deputy Nitrah.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.620
- Nice to meet you.

01:40.620 --> 01:42.437
- Thanks for calling us up

01:42.437 --> 01:44.411
even without the jurisdictional pushback.

01:44.411 --> 01:46.717
- Well we found evidence that may help

01:46.717 --> 01:47.957
to find the missing Doran girl

01:47.957 --> 01:50.452
so we're gonna do so
by any means necessary.

01:50.452 --> 01:51.656
- This isn't about jurisdictions

01:51.656 --> 01:53.373
this is about a missing girl,

01:53.373 --> 01:54.963
maybe even the Doran girl.

01:54.963 --> 01:56.292
- Yeah, we appreciate the call.

01:56.292 --> 01:58.239
Now let's get our teams
up here and get to work.

01:58.239 --> 02:00.989
- [Deputy Nitrah] Roger that mam.

02:01.953 --> 02:05.115
- Hey team it's Stanley,
I need you up here.

02:05.115 --> 02:05.948
- [Man] When?

02:05.948 --> 02:06.948
- Right now.

02:06.948 --> 02:09.698
(dramatic music)

02:19.138 --> 02:21.792
(siren roaring)

02:21.792 --> 02:24.125
- Incoming, keep it sterile.

02:29.882 --> 02:30.715
- Mrs. Doran.
- Do you have her?

02:30.715 --> 02:31.676
- Mrs. Doran.
- Do you have her?

02:31.676 --> 02:33.522
- Okay, my name is Detective Stanley,

02:33.522 --> 02:35.670
this is my partner Detective Hobbs.

02:35.670 --> 02:38.456
There may be some indication
that Theo was up here

02:38.456 --> 02:40.206
as recently as today.

02:41.099 --> 02:41.932
Make a hole,

02:41.932 --> 02:44.232
I'm gonna take you what I
brought you up here to show you.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.200
- [Jessica] Thank you.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.287
- I need you to stay focused on me.

02:47.287 --> 02:50.211
This is, could be a little difficult.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.182
Please watch your step here.

02:53.182 --> 02:55.991
Did Theo give any indication
that she was suicidal?

02:55.991 --> 02:57.266
- What?

02:57.266 --> 02:58.433
No, I mean no.

03:00.415 --> 03:02.093
She's a normal teenager.

03:02.093 --> 03:05.733
She had her moods and deep
dark secrets and everything

03:05.733 --> 03:07.740
but you tell me what teenager doesn't.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.096
- [Detective Stanley] What about you sir?

03:09.096 --> 03:12.096
Every moment that passes is crucial.

03:14.146 --> 03:18.340
- There was an incident
a couple of weeks ago.

03:18.340 --> 03:21.340
It was after the campaign party she,

03:26.037 --> 03:28.191
she told me that she was gay

03:28.191 --> 03:29.041
and then she--
- What?

03:29.041 --> 03:31.255
- Introduced me to her girlfriend.

03:31.255 --> 03:33.968
It was right after the guests left.

03:33.968 --> 03:35.893
She said, "There was something
she needed to tell me,

03:35.893 --> 03:37.766
"something important and there was someone

03:37.766 --> 03:38.759
"she wanted me to meet."

03:38.759 --> 03:39.629
- [Detective Stanley] Who is this person

03:39.629 --> 03:41.064
that she wanted you to meet?

03:41.064 --> 03:44.601
- Look I don't see how
any of this is relevant.

03:44.601 --> 03:45.882
Couldn't she have just run off?

03:45.882 --> 03:47.088
Kids do that all the time.

03:47.088 --> 03:48.365
Why would--
- We searched her backpack,

03:48.365 --> 03:50.282
sir, and we found this.

03:52.016 --> 03:53.099
- What is it?

03:54.636 --> 03:59.622
(mumbles) to do, how harsh this world

03:59.622 --> 04:02.984
is on people (mumbles).

04:02.984 --> 04:06.591
- [William] No, no, no, no,
no, she would not do that.

04:06.591 --> 04:10.199
She's not like, she's got straight A's.

04:10.199 --> 04:11.570
- There's more.
- She's perfect.

04:11.570 --> 04:14.008
- One of the hoodies was
found drenched in blood

04:14.008 --> 04:17.348
and there's more blood
that leads to the creek.

04:17.348 --> 04:21.821
- Tell her, tell her, goddamn
you tell her who's this girl

04:21.821 --> 04:23.163
that she introduced you to.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.811
Who is she and why didn't
you tell me I'm her mother?

04:26.811 --> 04:28.380
I needed to be there for you.

04:28.380 --> 04:32.463
You just, goddamn you,
she's dead because of you.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.546
No.
- Stay calm.

04:34.546 --> 04:36.689
- (mumbles) to calm down.

04:36.689 --> 04:38.644
You do not tell me to calm down.

04:38.644 --> 04:39.848
Do you have kids?

04:39.848 --> 04:41.047
No.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.003
I'm her mother.
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:43.003 --> 04:45.684
We are doing the best we can.

04:45.684 --> 04:47.423
- Let's grab you a warm blanket up there

04:47.423 --> 04:48.902
so you can regroup okay.

04:48.902 --> 04:51.284
(crying)

04:51.284 --> 04:52.904
- Mr. Doran, come with me.

04:52.904 --> 04:53.737
Let's go this way.

04:53.737 --> 04:55.171
Come on.

04:55.171 --> 04:56.951
Listen, tell me what I need to know

04:56.951 --> 04:59.973
or I will book you for obstruction.

04:59.973 --> 05:01.992
There's no winning here.

05:01.992 --> 05:04.188
You've got a decision to make

05:04.188 --> 05:07.375
either it gets out that you're
impeding an investigation

05:07.375 --> 05:10.708
or your daughter is suicide, you choose.

05:14.070 --> 05:15.798
- I wanna talk to my lawyer.

05:15.798 --> 05:16.631
- Right.

05:17.604 --> 05:18.473
He wants his lawyer.

05:18.473 --> 05:19.572
Let's take him in for questioning.

05:19.572 --> 05:22.072
- Wait, wait, wait, just okay.

05:24.163 --> 05:24.996
Okay.

05:25.993 --> 05:30.727
Theo introduced me to her
lover, her female lover.

05:30.727 --> 05:33.305
Some maid from next door I think.

05:33.305 --> 05:35.722
Pamela, I think was her name.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.460
I was shocked.

05:37.460 --> 05:40.008
It was right during my campaign party.

05:40.008 --> 05:42.175
- What did you say to her?

05:47.642 --> 05:49.975
- That I would rather die...

05:52.741 --> 05:53.991
or have her die

05:56.120 --> 05:59.537
than to have my daughter come out as gay.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.768
I screamed at Pamela
about being hired help

06:04.768 --> 06:06.989
and that she was out of line

06:06.989 --> 06:11.347
and I banished them from
ever seeing each other again.

06:11.347 --> 06:12.180
- I see.

06:14.227 --> 06:17.010
Look we've got another problem,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.742
this river runs westward underground

06:19.742 --> 06:21.720
for the next three miles.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.282
- What does that mean?

06:23.282 --> 06:25.650
- If someone fell in
there's very little chance

06:25.650 --> 06:27.567
of recovering the body.

06:28.815 --> 06:29.648
- No.

06:29.648 --> 06:30.645
What?

06:30.645 --> 06:32.728
God this isn't happening.

06:35.074 --> 06:35.907
Oh my God.

06:37.978 --> 06:39.709
That's Theo's, that's Theo's hoodie.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.459
That's Theo's hoodie.

06:42.696 --> 06:44.779
(crying)

06:52.065 --> 06:52.898
No.

06:54.613 --> 06:58.088
I wouldn't have said it,
I wouldn't have (mumbles).

06:58.088 --> 07:00.171
(crying)

07:04.846 --> 07:07.013
Heavenly Father please no.

07:08.589 --> 07:09.756
Please, please

07:10.935 --> 07:12.156
Heavenly Father.

07:12.156 --> 07:14.239
(crying)

07:15.412 --> 07:17.745
(screaming)

07:28.600 --> 07:31.267
(phone ringing)

07:46.605 --> 07:47.992
- Are you sure about this?

07:47.992 --> 07:50.452
We can change our minds
before it's too late.

07:50.452 --> 07:53.005
- We are better as friends.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.214
And we're practically
roommates at this point

07:55.214 --> 07:56.663
and you know that.

07:56.663 --> 08:00.050
So let's not go in circles again.

08:00.050 --> 08:02.371
- Mary, Tia needs us both right now.

08:02.371 --> 08:05.473
Okay, this drug experimentation
thing that she's doing

08:05.473 --> 08:07.686
it's not getting any better.

08:07.686 --> 08:09.799
What about our daughter?

08:09.799 --> 08:13.307
What about our temple sealing,
our celestial marriage?

08:13.307 --> 08:15.860
- Fuck celestial marriage.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.350
I tried it your way and
that still wasn't enough

08:18.350 --> 08:20.810
and I'm sick and tired
of being a hallow shell

08:20.810 --> 08:22.677
popping antidepressants.

08:22.677 --> 08:25.022
It doesn't help you, it
doesn't help our daughter,

08:25.022 --> 08:27.286
and especially not myself.

08:27.286 --> 08:28.926
I'm finally doing me for once

08:28.926 --> 08:29.879
and you know what?

08:29.879 --> 08:32.549
You're obviously not happy either.

08:32.549 --> 08:35.034
She was barely an adult Ken,

08:35.034 --> 08:37.131
what the hell are you thinking?

08:37.131 --> 08:38.850
You're sick.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.630
So just quit the facade for once.

08:40.630 --> 08:41.462
Okay.

08:41.462 --> 08:45.432
And embrace you, a man
that loves younger woman.

08:45.432 --> 08:46.349
Go get her.

08:48.103 --> 08:49.436
- You know what?

08:51.437 --> 08:53.604
You will never understand.

08:54.446 --> 08:57.048
- I know this is a really sensitive time,

08:57.048 --> 08:59.887
do you need to take a step and go outside

08:59.887 --> 09:01.594
just take a moment.

09:01.594 --> 09:02.427
- [Mary] No.

09:02.427 --> 09:03.857
- We do have other customers here.

09:03.857 --> 09:06.607
- Sign the goddamn papers please.

09:27.952 --> 09:30.133
- I can't say I blame her.

09:30.133 --> 09:32.263
Your mom has too strong of a personality

09:32.263 --> 09:35.459
to be held down by his expectations.

09:35.459 --> 09:39.523
- We both know that he's
got someone on the side.

09:39.523 --> 09:43.082
He does not hide behind
that facade at all.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.728
Meanwhile my mom is stuck here.

09:45.728 --> 09:48.858
She's given up everything from her life

09:48.858 --> 09:52.097
just to appease their lifestyle.

09:52.097 --> 09:54.308
- We need to get her stoned man.

09:54.308 --> 09:55.159
(laughing)

09:55.159 --> 09:58.503
And it can be worse than the
shit she's already popping.

09:58.503 --> 10:00.253
Plus no side effects.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.295
It's practically legal now anyways.

10:04.295 --> 10:07.687
- Seriously, your dad'll
be home in like an hour.

10:07.687 --> 10:08.828
Okay.

10:08.828 --> 10:10.099
You know I don't care about weed

10:10.099 --> 10:12.085
it's only thing that helps
my arm after the accident

10:12.085 --> 10:13.858
but you dad is gonna have a knipshin

10:13.858 --> 10:16.608
if he comes home and smells this.

10:18.978 --> 10:19.811
Hi, Theo.

10:45.818 --> 10:48.445
- Your mom needs to get laid.

10:48.445 --> 10:50.921
- By someone who doesn't
view her as a commodity

10:50.921 --> 10:52.390

11:15.245 --> 11:17.711
I mean maybe it's because
of who her dad is.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.407
The votes were rigged.

11:19.407 --> 11:22.164
- Or maybe it's because
she's a cool girl Dianna.

11:22.164 --> 11:24.037
Not everything's a conspiracy.

11:24.037 --> 11:25.077
- Yeah right.

11:25.077 --> 11:26.722
I'll bet her dad had a
word with the committee

11:26.722 --> 11:28.916
or paid them off or something.

11:28.916 --> 11:32.841
- Uh-huh, let me guess, are
you flat earthier now too?

11:32.841 --> 11:34.666
- [Dianna] Ignorance is bliss Nicole,

11:34.666 --> 11:36.666

- Theo.

15:59.662 --> 16:00.913
Why does she do that?

16:00.913 --> 16:03.996
- She's 17, that's what teenagers do.

can't even believe that.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.596
- What?

16:14.596 --> 16:18.177
- Touched my tattoos and now
his whole career is ruined.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.045
I mean where are they gonna draw the line.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.931

16:21.931 --> 16:23.637
But think of it this way.

16:23.637 --> 16:26.353

power of people in groups.

16:34.731 --> 16:35.874
(laughing)

16:35.874 --> 16:37.705
- I mean you just watch
if it's not this movement,

16:37.705 --> 16:40.892
it'll be another, and
another, and another.

16:40.892 --> 16:43.192
People feed on drama.

16:43.192 --> 16:45.395
And besides people can change right?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.069
I mean look at Elder Justin

16:47.069 --> 16:49.075
he was leaning towards being gay

16:49.075 --> 16:51.331
and that camp took whatever
was gay right out of him.

16:51.331 --> 16:56.331
- Okay says the ex-hippie punk
rocker hallucinogenic addict

16:56.699 --> 16:58.291
who knocked me up out of wedlock.

16:58.291 --> 17:00.950
Really Will, you're gonna judge.

17:00.950 --> 17:03.735
- That just proves my point my dear,

17:03.735 --> 17:06.484
people can change for the better.

17:07.383 --> 17:11.633
- Okay so you are on edge
and I blame the campaign.

17:14.109 --> 17:15.693
More hot coco dear?

17:17.434 --> 17:18.517
- Yes please.

17:19.699 --> 17:20.781
- You got it.

17:30.334 --> 17:32.834
(light music)

17:45.239 --> 17:46.572
- Ah, goddammit.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.885
What is, what is on the dog?

17:51.885 --> 17:53.351
- [Dark Haired Girl] Grandma
crapped her pants again.

17:53.351 --> 17:56.979
- And then she smeared
it on the dog again.

17:56.979 --> 17:58.146
- Oh dear God.

18:06.314 --> 18:07.147
Here.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.302
Hey love can you come get her for a sec.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.256
- [Brody] Yes love, I got this.

18:18.256 --> 18:19.089
- Thank you.

18:19.089 --> 18:21.756
(phone ringing)

18:25.957 --> 18:26.934
- Hey Jane.

18:26.934 --> 18:30.186
- Hey love are you getting nervous?

18:30.186 --> 18:31.439
- You do not even know,

18:31.439 --> 18:36.357
I have been popping anti-anxiety
pills like they're candy.

18:36.357 --> 18:38.182
- Okay settle down on that.

18:38.182 --> 18:40.728
Dear Lord, I may be your best friend

18:40.728 --> 18:42.298
but I'm about two seconds away

18:42.298 --> 18:43.581
from cussing you out.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.351
- I know, I know, it's just that,

18:46.351 --> 18:48.608
it helps to calm me down.

18:48.608 --> 18:52.084
Will has been more and
more on edge the closer

18:52.084 --> 18:53.787
we get to the election.

18:53.787 --> 18:58.370
And Theo, Theo's the reason
why I called you yesterday.

18:59.276 --> 19:02.983
She's been so, she's been
more distant than ever

19:02.983 --> 19:04.216
and I can't reach her.

19:04.216 --> 19:05.932
I don't know what to do.

19:05.932 --> 19:07.329
I'm worried.

19:07.329 --> 19:09.309
- Just give her some space.

19:09.309 --> 19:12.367
Do you remember our hormones
when we were her age?

19:12.367 --> 19:15.596
- No, but Theo, Theo's different.

19:15.596 --> 19:17.793
She's been spending a
lot of time in her room

19:17.793 --> 19:19.210
and I mean a lot.

19:20.313 --> 19:23.681
And she screams at me, "Mom, get out!"

19:23.681 --> 19:25.613
And then she bolts into her closet

19:25.613 --> 19:29.509
like she didn't even want me to see her.

19:29.509 --> 19:32.121
- I don't know, all
teenagers have secrets.

19:32.121 --> 19:34.925
She just, she's coming into her own.

19:34.925 --> 19:37.182
- Yeah, good point.

19:37.182 --> 19:38.226
- You know what you need?

19:38.226 --> 19:40.688
You need to come over and
we need a girl's night.

19:40.688 --> 19:43.418
You need to relax and kick your feet up.

19:43.418 --> 19:44.810
- Heck yes.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.071
- Oh, you know what?

19:46.071 --> 19:47.956
We need to get Mary in on this.

19:47.956 --> 19:49.862
Did you hear, she signed the divorce

19:49.862 --> 19:52.048
papers like two days ago?

19:52.048 --> 19:53.298
- Yes, I heard.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.005
You know she could
probably use some shoulders

19:57.005 --> 19:59.459
to cry on right now.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.451
And she could use a serious intervention.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.655
You know between the two of us

20:03.655 --> 20:06.788
we could probably get her off
those antidepressant drugs.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.539
- Well I think right now
what she really needs

20:09.539 --> 20:11.601
is just our support.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.364
- Good point.

20:13.364 --> 20:14.447
You're right.

20:15.622 --> 20:16.955
I love you Jane.

20:17.934 --> 20:20.601
(keys clicking)

20:23.844 --> 20:25.854
- [Detective Stanley]
Well have to look in that.

20:25.854 --> 20:27.088
- [Jay] We'll se what they can give us.

20:27.088 --> 20:28.437
- Right.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.304
Hey Ingrid, what have you got for us?

20:30.304 --> 20:31.137
- Hey guys.

20:31.137 --> 20:34.168
The forensic report came
back the DNA blood evidence

20:34.168 --> 20:36.850
is definitely human and
appears to be a match

20:36.850 --> 20:39.992
from the sample the father
brought in from her hair brush.

20:39.992 --> 20:41.192
There's another thing though,

20:41.192 --> 20:43.748
someone else's blood was found on a hoodie

20:43.748 --> 20:45.333
and leading into the creek.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.888
Do you have any idea who that could be?

20:47.888 --> 20:50.344
- We've got no body.

20:50.344 --> 20:52.732
We have the hoodie leading into the creek.

20:52.732 --> 20:55.925
We've got the backpack with
some personal items in it.

20:55.925 --> 20:57.468
We have a very distraught father

20:57.468 --> 21:00.821
who did not approve of
his daughter's lifestyle.

21:00.821 --> 21:03.326
- Yeah, (mumbles).

21:03.326 --> 21:04.830
- Hey, we're gonna head
back to the crime scene,

21:04.830 --> 21:06.063
let us know if you find anything else.

21:06.063 --> 21:07.094
- Yeah, will do.

21:07.094 --> 21:07.927
- Thanks.

21:13.399 --> 21:15.526
Jay, what do you got?

21:15.526 --> 21:18.468
- [Jay] You don't wanna,
you'll need years of therapy.

21:18.468 --> 21:21.891
- Okay, I need to see what you see.

21:21.891 --> 21:23.800
- It's not Afghanistan

21:23.800 --> 21:27.767
those shots were fired
it's too messy for that.

21:27.767 --> 21:29.613
Whatever it is was well planned.

21:29.613 --> 21:31.738
But as it was happening
it went south real quick.

21:31.738 --> 21:33.905
- What makes you say that?

21:33.905 --> 21:36.644
- They went old school, blades came out.

21:36.644 --> 21:37.977
Neither one are very skilled,

21:37.977 --> 21:40.187
you can tell by the angle of the splatter

21:40.187 --> 21:43.343
but either way they carved
each other up pretty bad.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.361
- What do you make of these prints?

21:45.361 --> 21:49.444
- [Jay] Four sets, those
two are the most active.

21:51.645 --> 21:55.645
- No body but we have
enough blood for a murder.

21:56.590 --> 21:57.423
All right, don't say anything

21:57.423 --> 21:59.473
till we hear back from forensics.

21:59.473 --> 22:02.223
- [Jay] They'll make it official.

22:10.596 --> 22:11.734
- Come on in.

22:11.734 --> 22:12.567
- [Detective Stanley] Thank you mam.

22:12.567 --> 22:14.848
- [Jessica] So what leads do
you have, what have you found?

22:14.848 --> 22:16.592
- With all due respect mam everyone

22:16.592 --> 22:20.284
is working very diligently on this case.

22:20.284 --> 22:24.411
Now the DNA from Theo's
hairbrush unfortunately

22:24.411 --> 22:27.399
matched the DNA we found
on the hoodie at the scene.

22:27.399 --> 22:28.232
- What does that mean?

22:28.232 --> 22:29.178
What are you saying?

22:29.178 --> 22:30.396
What does that even mean?
- I'm sorry.

22:30.396 --> 22:33.623
I know this is difficult
but you have to stay calm.

22:33.623 --> 22:35.790
I can't imagine what you're
going through right now

22:35.790 --> 22:38.048
but we are here to help.

22:38.048 --> 22:38.881
- Okay.

22:41.397 --> 22:42.738
- Continue.

22:42.738 --> 22:45.405
- Well, the DNA on Theo's hoodie

22:46.819 --> 22:49.908
is not only piece of evidence
we found at the scene.

22:49.908 --> 22:54.785
There was someone else's
blood and that's not all.

22:54.785 --> 22:58.483
There were footprints,
two adult sized footprints

22:58.483 --> 23:01.233
and possible signs of a struggle.

23:02.207 --> 23:03.916
Mr. And Mrs. Doran, do you know of anyone

23:03.916 --> 23:05.943
who would want to harm your daughter

23:05.943 --> 23:09.559
or can you think, have
you received any threats?

23:09.559 --> 23:12.781
- Has any one contacted you for a ransom?

23:12.781 --> 23:14.846
- Can you imagine, is
there anyone who would

23:14.846 --> 23:16.390
want your daughter dead?

23:16.390 --> 23:17.733
- I don't know what you're saying.

23:17.733 --> 23:18.892
I don't understand.

23:18.892 --> 23:20.877
- Theo was at the top of her class.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.265
She was the most popular girl in school.

23:23.265 --> 23:24.276
She was the prom queen.

23:24.276 --> 23:25.934
Everybody loved our daughter.

23:25.934 --> 23:27.702
- Plus she was straight A student,

23:27.702 --> 23:29.979
all her teachers loved her and--

23:29.979 --> 23:30.812
- Okay.
- She participated--

23:30.812 --> 23:32.931
- We are looking--
- In church activities and--

23:32.931 --> 23:33.947
- Mam, we're looking

23:33.947 --> 23:36.921
at all possibilities at this point.

23:36.921 --> 23:40.644
This could be a potential
case of corpus delicti,

23:40.644 --> 23:43.434
which is a possible murder.

23:43.434 --> 23:44.672
But we have no body.

23:44.672 --> 23:46.518
(crying)

23:46.518 --> 23:48.400
Every day that passes is crucial

23:48.400 --> 23:50.042
and we are working diligently

23:50.042 --> 23:52.320
but sir, considering your statements

23:52.320 --> 23:56.737
we're going to need to ask
you to come to the station.

23:56.737 --> 23:59.320
We have more questions for you.

24:00.303 --> 24:02.291
I think we should go now.

24:02.291 --> 24:04.134
- [Jay] We'll see ourselves out.

24:04.134 --> 24:06.217
(crying)

24:07.798 --> 24:09.881

24:19.793 --> 24:21.279

24:39.197 --> 24:40.030
- Theo.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.547
- Do I know you?

24:43.547 --> 24:44.714
- No, I'm Max.

24:47.496 --> 24:49.163
Everybody knows you.

24:51.184 --> 24:52.851
I saw you yesterday.

24:54.245 --> 24:55.828
- What do you mean?

24:58.778 --> 25:02.921
- I saw you go into the
bathroom looking one way

25:02.921 --> 25:05.754
and coming out completely changed.

25:06.918 --> 25:08.529
Don't worry I won't tell a soul

25:08.529 --> 25:11.855
but why do you care what people think?

25:11.855 --> 25:12.688
- It's not that simple.

25:12.688 --> 25:15.895
♪ The siren she's calling ♪

25:15.895 --> 25:18.044
- Coming out really isn't that hard.

25:18.044 --> 25:22.836
I mean eventually they'll
get over it or they don't

25:22.836 --> 25:26.738
but letting your spirit die is not good

25:26.738 --> 25:30.321
and snuffing out your
true self it's toxic.

25:32.837 --> 25:34.087
Isn't worth it.

25:35.406 --> 25:40.406
♪ We sailed into a storm
before the dawn break ♪

25:43.088 --> 25:48.088
♪ We must've crashed
into some kind of reef ♪

25:49.325 --> 25:52.242
(group chattering)

25:53.595 --> 25:58.595
- Oh my God, you would think
she has learned her lesson.

25:59.008 --> 26:02.216
Trash like you belong
at rehabilitation camps

26:02.216 --> 26:04.493
or whatever they are.

26:04.493 --> 26:06.993
You transgender piece of shit!

26:09.316 --> 26:11.782
Go to some liberal state like Seattle.

26:11.782 --> 26:12.749
- Would you stop.

26:12.749 --> 26:14.599
She's not hurting anything or anyone.

26:14.599 --> 26:15.931
- Bull shit.

26:15.931 --> 26:18.906
She or he or whatever it
is hurting this school

26:18.906 --> 26:20.594
by even being here.

26:20.594 --> 26:22.094
She makes me sick.

26:23.169 --> 26:24.002
Get out!

26:26.656 --> 26:28.014
(laughing)

26:28.014 --> 26:29.524
Theo.

26:29.524 --> 26:30.357
Oh my God.

26:31.738 --> 26:32.970
- Please, please I--

26:32.970 --> 26:36.858
- These are going to be online everywhere.

26:36.858 --> 26:39.191
Just wait prom queen my ass.

26:40.490 --> 26:42.478
Oh, looks like little Theo

26:42.478 --> 26:45.719
has some daddy issues to work out.

26:45.719 --> 26:49.273
This is going to destroy your dad.

26:49.273 --> 26:50.760
- Shandra let it go.
- You are either

26:50.760 --> 26:53.510
with me or her bitch, you decide.

26:56.004 --> 26:58.837
(camera snapping)

27:02.559 --> 27:04.160
- It's spoiled little girls like you

27:04.160 --> 27:06.698
that make it hard on all of us.

27:06.698 --> 27:09.950
If you ever tell anyone about this I,

27:09.950 --> 27:12.601
let's just say my dad knows
people in high places.

27:12.601 --> 27:15.259
So you can either choose to
let this get out through you

27:15.259 --> 27:16.384
and have him find out that way

27:16.384 --> 27:19.074
but if he does he will
do everything he can

27:19.074 --> 27:21.086
to keep you quiet.

27:21.086 --> 27:23.738
Or you can let me come out on my own.

27:23.738 --> 27:25.618
On my own terms.

27:25.618 --> 27:28.556
And you can giggle,
and laugh, and make fun

27:28.556 --> 27:32.917
but my dad's people will not (mumbles).

27:32.917 --> 27:34.562
So choose.

27:34.562 --> 27:37.229
(foot thudding)

27:42.044 --> 27:45.284
- [Pamela] Wait.
- Get a grip Theo.

27:45.284 --> 27:47.034
What have you become?

27:49.223 --> 27:50.767
- Would you just wait a minute.

27:50.767 --> 27:51.850
Are you okay?

27:53.590 --> 27:55.961
I'm Pamela, the maid next door.

27:55.961 --> 27:57.381
Why are you crying?

27:57.381 --> 27:58.298
Can I help?

27:59.401 --> 28:03.693
- It's just, it's just
some stuff at school.

28:03.693 --> 28:05.693
- Let me guess, bullies.

28:06.726 --> 28:09.143
- I guess you could say that.

28:10.503 --> 28:11.999
- I see you come out of your house one way

28:11.999 --> 28:13.983
and back into your house this way

28:13.983 --> 28:16.896
and I can say with certainty
that you're beautiful

28:16.896 --> 28:20.138
no matter what you decide to wear.

28:20.138 --> 28:22.721
I'm sorry that happened to you.

28:24.152 --> 28:26.152
- You've seen me before.

28:27.278 --> 28:28.611
Look I gotta go.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.908
I can't have my parents find me like this.

28:32.908 --> 28:34.408
- Like what upset?

28:42.209 --> 28:44.126
- Hey, where you going?

28:46.045 --> 28:47.709
- Not that it's any of you business now

28:47.709 --> 28:50.876
but Jane's having a fundraising event.

28:51.989 --> 28:54.781
- Okay, I just wanted to let you know

28:54.781 --> 28:56.750
that I'm almost packed up

28:56.750 --> 29:00.369
so I'll only be here for
a couple more nights.

29:00.369 --> 29:02.037
I really appreciate how
understanding you've been

29:02.037 --> 29:03.893
with this whole thing.

29:03.893 --> 29:06.932
You know usually people
separate and then divorce

29:06.932 --> 29:08.867
not the other way around.

29:08.867 --> 29:09.700
So thanks.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.201
And you can keep our collection of vinyl.

29:16.201 --> 29:18.368
- You bet your ass I will.

29:19.615 --> 29:20.448
- Okay then.

29:20.448 --> 29:22.865
Well have a nice night, Mary.

29:24.482 --> 29:26.899
(vocalizing)

29:33.037 --> 29:35.787
(softly singing)

30:08.362 --> 30:10.316
(softly singing)

30:10.316 --> 30:12.733
- You deserve so much better.

30:14.231 --> 30:15.564
You always have.

30:17.652 --> 30:19.235
Besides you're hot.

30:23.250 --> 30:26.125
And you know what they
say 40's the new 30.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.875
(softly singing)

30:31.374 --> 30:32.207
Goddammit.

30:32.207 --> 30:34.957
(softly singing)

30:48.054 --> 30:50.554
(light music)

31:59.814 --> 32:02.630
- I just don't understand it,

32:02.630 --> 32:05.297
I sacrificed everything for him.

32:06.604 --> 32:11.165
I converted to the church,
and I became housebroken,

32:11.165 --> 32:14.748
and I devoted myself
to our eternal family.

32:18.748 --> 32:22.169
I still love the church with all my heart.

32:22.169 --> 32:24.343
I mean if it wasn't for the Relief Society

32:24.343 --> 32:29.343
and (mumbles), and nights
like this with you ladies,

32:30.391 --> 32:33.903
I would be in a much
different place right now.

32:33.903 --> 32:36.070
A place without community.

32:37.088 --> 32:40.755
- Well in all fairness,
I feel the same way.

32:43.584 --> 32:46.834
Over the years after Will and converted

32:48.320 --> 32:51.737
there have been both good and bad things.

32:52.673 --> 32:55.673
Will became more of a father figure,

32:57.207 --> 33:00.199
more present in our lives.

33:00.199 --> 33:05.199
And he put our family and
our empire above all else.

33:05.335 --> 33:10.002
But at the same time bits of
his personality just faded.

33:15.092 --> 33:16.509
And now politics,

33:17.683 --> 33:20.993
I never would have thought,
not in a million years.

33:20.993 --> 33:22.783
- And definitely not Republican.

33:22.783 --> 33:26.133
- Oh, don't even get me started.

33:26.133 --> 33:29.997
- Yeah, hey I don't
judge, I certainly don't.

33:29.997 --> 33:32.499
And you guys were in love okay.

33:32.499 --> 33:34.452
You thought you were
going in the direction

33:34.452 --> 33:36.010
that was best for you.

33:36.010 --> 33:38.780
Hindsight is always 20/20.

33:38.780 --> 33:41.693
Brody and I we certainly are perfect.

33:41.693 --> 33:45.335
In fact about an hour he
wanted to ring my neck

33:45.335 --> 33:46.585
but we survive.

33:48.981 --> 33:50.595
- Cheers to that.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.008
- Yep.

33:52.008 --> 33:52.841
- Cheers.

33:54.455 --> 33:56.544
- [Jane] Yep that's why I drink a lot.

33:56.544 --> 33:58.433
(laughing)

33:58.433 --> 33:59.428
It's not that much.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.575
(laughing)

34:01.575 --> 34:03.449
I'm sober mostly.

34:03.449 --> 34:06.551
- I wanna show you something.

34:06.551 --> 34:08.242
I know we haven't know
each other very long

34:08.242 --> 34:09.574
but I trust you.

34:12.348 --> 34:14.467
You see me for me.

34:14.467 --> 34:16.467
No one's ever seen this.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.371
I keep all of my thoughts in here

34:20.371 --> 34:23.687
and lately there's been a lot of them.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.703
Especially after the incident at school.

34:27.703 --> 34:30.203
These words are a piece of me.

34:31.232 --> 34:34.259
I always have leaves
from this forest in here

34:34.259 --> 34:36.422
and twigs, and basically
anything else sacred

34:36.422 --> 34:39.505
that you glue in with acrylic medium.

34:40.643 --> 34:41.722
I was brought up in the church

34:41.722 --> 34:45.373
but I never felt a connection to it.

34:45.373 --> 34:48.786
I've always felt a
connection here in nature

34:48.786 --> 34:51.119
not in any church or temple.

34:53.149 --> 34:56.664
When I'm here the wind blows in my hair

34:56.664 --> 34:59.042
and my feet are grounded to the earth.

34:59.042 --> 35:01.381
And I feel one with the universe.

35:01.381 --> 35:06.277
In my mind anything is
possible with this connection.

35:06.277 --> 35:08.888
I can impact my surroundings with my mind.

35:08.888 --> 35:11.055
It's nature, it's science.

35:12.252 --> 35:13.585
Can you feel it?

35:14.571 --> 35:16.715
- My family is from Brazil,

35:16.715 --> 35:19.681
my mother came here
when I was just a baby.

35:19.681 --> 35:21.487
She'd tell me stories
about the small village

35:21.487 --> 35:25.407
where we came from, the
people believed in magic.

35:25.407 --> 35:27.335
They worshiped the mother goddess Yemọja

35:27.335 --> 35:28.572
and were also many other deities,

35:28.572 --> 35:32.261
like water spirits, land
spirits, spirits of the people.

35:32.261 --> 35:33.528
Of course worshiping was very rare

35:33.528 --> 35:35.845
because Catholics made up
the majority of our village

35:35.845 --> 35:37.717
but these spirits have
always spoken to me.

35:37.717 --> 35:38.902
They live in everything.

35:38.902 --> 35:40.878
- Yes, that's exactly what I feel.

35:40.878 --> 35:44.210
I'm one with nature and
all the spirits within it.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.270
- Sometimes my mother would speak

35:45.270 --> 35:47.363
of becoming one with the universe.

35:47.363 --> 35:48.353
There were legends that people

35:48.353 --> 35:52.878
would leave earthly and mortal
realm and just disappear.

35:52.878 --> 35:54.154
- Where would they go?

35:54.154 --> 35:56.625
- They would become one
with the cosmos, with nature

35:56.625 --> 35:58.292
and of the elements.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.943

37:12.340 --> 37:15.007
(door knocking)

37:17.796 --> 37:19.309
- Has there been any news?

37:19.309 --> 37:20.500
- I have been instructed to bring you

37:20.500 --> 37:21.992
into the station for questioning.

37:21.992 --> 37:23.300
- What?

37:23.300 --> 37:25.413
How is that gonna possible help?

37:25.413 --> 37:26.787
- [Police Officer] Just
do as you are told sir.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.037
Make it easier on yourself.

37:32.466 --> 37:33.299
- Jessica.

37:34.590 --> 37:35.423
Jess.

37:45.598 --> 37:46.964
(door knocking)

37:46.964 --> 37:47.797
- Go away.

37:49.259 --> 37:51.897
- Darling you need to snap out of it.

37:51.897 --> 37:52.980
Where's Will?

37:54.467 --> 37:56.650
- He's at the station I think.

37:56.650 --> 37:59.532
- You haven't been
answering any of my calls.

37:59.532 --> 38:01.532
Have you eaten anything?

38:04.142 --> 38:05.768
(groaning)

38:05.768 --> 38:08.968
Why does it smelled like
something died in here?

38:08.968 --> 38:11.635
- Something did die in here, me.

38:17.384 --> 38:19.051
What if Theo is dead

38:20.279 --> 38:22.801
or has disappeared and gone forever?

38:22.801 --> 38:25.657
Whatever happened to her it's my fault.

38:25.657 --> 38:26.644
- What?

38:26.644 --> 38:28.725
- I wasn't there for her.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.177
I didn't know my own daughter

38:30.177 --> 38:32.427
and I missed all the signs.

38:34.214 --> 38:37.453
And now God has abandoned
me, he's punishing me.

38:37.453 --> 38:38.286
- No.

38:39.397 --> 38:40.397
No, come on.

38:41.412 --> 38:44.079
That is garbage and you know it.

38:45.653 --> 38:47.650
Why don't we get yourself up, okay.

38:47.650 --> 38:52.118
And we will go do some
investigating of our own.

38:52.118 --> 38:55.202
Maybe we can find out who Theo is.

38:55.202 --> 38:59.702
If she's in trouble then
maybe it'll help us find her.

39:05.367 --> 39:06.617
- You're right.

39:07.715 --> 39:09.048
We can find her.

39:11.197 --> 39:14.197
And as long as I live I will believe

39:15.236 --> 39:18.153
that Heavenly Father will guide me.

39:20.101 --> 39:21.601
Where do we start?

39:22.453 --> 39:25.559
- I think we need to start
in that deep forbidden room

39:25.559 --> 39:29.976
that all teenagers call
their secret space, her room.

39:32.186 --> 39:34.853
(door creaking)

39:40.163 --> 39:44.163
- I haven't been in here
since Theo disappeared.

39:49.571 --> 39:51.821
I just want her to be here.

39:52.894 --> 39:54.727
I can still smell her.

40:00.235 --> 40:02.152
It's her dirty laundry.

40:03.404 --> 40:05.487
It's like she never left.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.795
How can she be dead when I
can still feel her like this.

40:10.795 --> 40:12.962
- No, she's not dead okay.

40:13.809 --> 40:15.559
We're gonna find her.

40:20.516 --> 40:24.599
Let's look around and
let's see what we can find.

40:54.566 --> 40:56.670
- This was my mothers.

40:56.670 --> 41:00.587
Theo used to keep her
childhood photos in here.

41:02.891 --> 41:04.378
- [Jane] Oh look at her.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.711
She's so little.

41:22.153 --> 41:23.905
What is that?

41:23.905 --> 41:25.988
- Theo's nature grimoire.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.823
Nature has variances and so do we.

41:38.870 --> 41:41.828
What difference does it
make if male of female,

41:41.828 --> 41:45.078
white or black, Democrat or Republican.

41:46.948 --> 41:48.365
So why do I hide?

41:49.583 --> 41:52.425
Why so many surfaces that matter?

41:52.425 --> 41:55.245
Trapped in society's cruel chatter.

41:55.245 --> 42:00.245
Appearing to be something
that I am really not inside.

42:00.425 --> 42:01.595
We have to keep going.

42:01.595 --> 42:03.213
We have to keep looking.

42:03.213 --> 42:06.645
- I think there's something here.

42:06.645 --> 42:07.645
It's a note.

42:10.587 --> 42:13.217
Just remember that no matter what they say

42:13.217 --> 42:17.172
you're beautiful to me
in both of your ways.

42:17.172 --> 42:18.592
Both of your ways.

42:18.592 --> 42:21.270
What kind of cryptic crap is that?

42:21.270 --> 42:26.270
- I don't know but I think it's
time for me to face the fact

42:26.904 --> 42:29.987
my daughter was living a double life.

42:37.745 --> 42:40.578
(muffled singing)

42:43.088 --> 42:45.346
- [Tia] All right dude, thanks
for spending the day with me.

42:45.346 --> 42:46.795
- Yeah, that's for the dress.

42:46.795 --> 42:48.480
- [Tia] It's looks so cute on you.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.671
It's gonna look great at
your dad's campaign party.

42:50.671 --> 42:52.059
- Thanks.

42:52.059 --> 42:53.987
- It's nice to be home between deployments

42:53.987 --> 42:57.987
but my parents divorcing
it's hard to be around.

43:00.908 --> 43:02.897
- When are you leaving again?

43:02.897 --> 43:05.288
- [Tia] End of the month.

43:05.288 --> 43:06.471
- I'm gonna miss you.

43:06.471 --> 43:09.499
- [Tia] Same kid, but you're
gonna look great in this dress.

43:09.499 --> 43:10.565
- Thanks.
- Have fun.

43:10.565 --> 43:11.398
- I won't.

43:14.343 --> 43:15.504
- [Detective Stanley]
Listen we're just trying

43:15.504 --> 43:17.157
to find his daughter,

43:17.157 --> 43:19.796
any information he could give
us could potentially help.

43:19.796 --> 43:22.178
- He is under no obligation to answer

43:22.178 --> 43:23.606
as he is not a suspect.

43:23.606 --> 43:25.547
- And as long as he tells the truth

43:25.547 --> 43:29.214
we have no reason to
question him otherwise.

43:32.570 --> 43:34.325
- Tell me what happened two weeks ago

43:34.325 --> 43:37.575
when your daughter told you her secret?

43:40.794 --> 43:41.627
- Okay.

43:43.603 --> 43:47.180
It all started with my campaign party.

43:47.180 --> 43:49.513
It was the talk of the town.

43:50.930 --> 43:54.350
All the elites, everyone
was there, the governor,

43:54.350 --> 43:56.350
the senators, the mayor.

43:57.978 --> 44:02.741
And my wife Jessica had
meticulously prepared the event.

44:02.741 --> 44:06.114
Torches were lite outside,
spiced wassail was pouring,

44:06.114 --> 44:10.455
the fireplace was beaming
with a strong fire,

44:10.455 --> 44:12.975
ambiance was perfect.

44:12.975 --> 44:15.367
I had a strong following
in the preliminary races

44:15.367 --> 44:17.322
and it showed.

44:17.322 --> 44:20.185
- I'd like to make a toast

44:20.185 --> 44:24.151
to the most family
valuing genuine fiscally

44:24.151 --> 44:28.734
responsible candidate I've
seen since our own governor.

44:30.598 --> 44:33.931
Leading this race by a landslide already

44:35.466 --> 44:38.883
I can't wait to see what he's going to do

44:39.756 --> 44:42.006
for our good state of Utah.

44:42.951 --> 44:45.201
We will not be lead astray.

44:47.180 --> 44:50.119
Let's keep this best kept secret,

44:50.119 --> 44:53.702
our unique Salt Lake
City a secret shall we

44:55.128 --> 44:58.211
for this is a place unlike any other.

45:00.617 --> 45:04.869
- Here, here and I toast the
man of the hour William Doran,

45:04.869 --> 45:08.217
the future senator of our great state.

45:08.217 --> 45:11.451
What an example you give
the people to live by.

45:11.451 --> 45:13.832
Let's keep traditional family values

45:13.832 --> 45:16.361
and a (mumbles) God prevail.

45:16.361 --> 45:17.194
- Indeed.

45:18.158 --> 45:20.658
A toast to success all around.

45:21.808 --> 45:25.789
Everybody join me in raising your glasses

45:25.789 --> 45:28.229
in honor of William Doran

45:28.229 --> 45:30.502
and the best state in the nation.

45:30.502 --> 45:32.354
God bless Utah.

45:32.354 --> 45:33.854
God bless America.

45:34.939 --> 45:36.593
And Doran for senate.

45:36.593 --> 45:38.813
- [Crowd] Doran for senate.

45:38.813 --> 45:39.646
(crowd clapping)

45:39.646 --> 45:42.396
(dramatic music)

45:45.786 --> 45:48.453
- Why didn't you tell your wife?

45:50.544 --> 45:55.127
- My wife she gave up her
past, her beliefs, everything

45:57.022 --> 45:58.439
to make me happy.

45:59.288 --> 46:01.543
We reared our daughter up in the church

46:01.543 --> 46:03.918
as a wholesome woman.

46:03.918 --> 46:06.845
She was saving herself
for marriage you know.

46:06.845 --> 46:10.038
Jessica has worked way
too hard to make me happy

46:10.038 --> 46:11.567
and to raise our daughter right

46:11.567 --> 46:13.380
in the eyes of our Heavenly Father.

46:13.380 --> 46:16.713
I just, I couldn't, I couldn't tell her.

46:16.713 --> 46:19.415
I couldn't break her heart like that.

46:19.415 --> 46:20.832
I just, I choked.

46:31.986 --> 46:34.069
- I don't approve of this gown.

46:34.069 --> 46:34.902
Wear this.

46:36.468 --> 46:40.056
And can you least try to
pretend you're enjoying this.

46:40.056 --> 46:41.802
We put a lot of work into this.

46:41.802 --> 46:45.154
And you're father's
career depends on this.

46:45.154 --> 46:49.733
Have you least mingled with
Senator Thomas's daughters yet?

46:49.733 --> 46:53.448
Theo, come on you always
used to have so much fun

46:53.448 --> 46:55.702
when you were younger.

46:55.702 --> 46:58.846
- Mom, you look lovely and I'm fine.

46:58.846 --> 47:02.524
I'm just observing, people watching.

47:02.524 --> 47:05.191
There's nothing wrong with that.

47:07.507 --> 47:08.840
- I suppose not.

47:10.532 --> 47:12.365
I do love you darling.

47:14.676 --> 47:16.009
Wear the jacket.

47:18.006 --> 47:19.589
- Love you too Mom.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.617
(group chattering)

47:22.617 --> 47:25.117
(light music)

47:30.789 --> 47:33.289
- I am so proud of all of this

47:34.562 --> 47:37.231
but I have to warn you other candidates

47:37.231 --> 47:39.993
have a way of sneaking up the last minute.

47:39.993 --> 47:41.719
We have to stick to our guns here.

47:41.719 --> 47:45.034
There's no room for any gray areas.

47:45.034 --> 47:49.861
- I understand although I
don't agree with all of it.

47:49.861 --> 47:52.523
For example I'm not
opposed to gay marriage

47:52.523 --> 47:55.260
or even abortion for that matter.

47:55.260 --> 47:57.132
I am a Conservative, yes.

47:57.132 --> 48:00.822
Fiscally responsible and God loving yes.

48:00.822 --> 48:03.173
But the rest of it's just not me.

48:03.173 --> 48:05.385
I mean this is all happening really fast

48:05.385 --> 48:06.768
and I'm not sure if I--

48:06.768 --> 48:10.824
- Well they absolutely cannot know that.

48:10.824 --> 48:11.741
Understood?

48:14.071 --> 48:17.734
Your win depends on
consistency in this red state.

48:17.734 --> 48:21.151
If you want votes you most do what I say.

48:33.205 --> 48:35.455
(laughing)

48:45.018 --> 48:47.210
- Hey thank you guys so much for coming.

48:47.210 --> 48:49.399
- Thank you for having us.
- We loved having you here.

48:49.399 --> 48:52.066
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

48:53.382 --> 48:55.453
- What a beautiful party, it was so great.

48:55.453 --> 48:58.036
- Thank you so much for coming.

48:59.047 --> 49:00.669
- Thank you.

49:00.669 --> 49:02.308
- [Dark Hair Woman] It was lovely.

49:02.308 --> 49:05.073
- Thank you so much for coming.

49:05.073 --> 49:06.815
- It was so nice to see.

49:06.815 --> 49:08.578
- Nice to see you too.

49:08.578 --> 49:11.558
- Well my beautiful wife I think

49:11.558 --> 49:13.859
that was nothing less than a success.

49:13.859 --> 49:15.247
(laughing)

49:15.247 --> 49:16.461
Did you hear what they said?

49:16.461 --> 49:17.294
- No.

49:17.294 --> 49:18.771
- We've got this thing.

49:18.771 --> 49:20.604
- I'm so proud of you.

49:21.960 --> 49:25.687
And I haven't seen you
this happy in a long time.

49:25.687 --> 49:27.335
Brings me back to those days

49:27.335 --> 49:30.968
when your band was in the spotlight

49:30.968 --> 49:33.385
and I couldn't love you more.

49:34.534 --> 49:36.451
I'm still your groupie.

49:41.087 --> 49:43.754
(lips smacking)

49:44.973 --> 49:49.326
Okay, well it's late and I
think we should be turning in.

49:49.326 --> 49:54.247
Let's let the maids handle
all this in the morning.

49:54.247 --> 49:57.231
- Oh hey, I'll be up in just a sec.

49:57.231 --> 50:00.037
I just wanna put out the fire
and the candles at least.

50:00.037 --> 50:02.204
- Okay, don't be too long.

50:25.004 --> 50:26.649
- [Theo] Dad.

50:26.649 --> 50:31.487
- Oh my goodness daughter,
you scared the life out of me.

50:31.487 --> 50:34.051
Did you enjoy the party?

50:34.051 --> 50:35.779
- Yeah, it was lovely.

50:35.779 --> 50:37.861
- [William] Good sweetheart.

50:37.861 --> 50:39.570
- Dad, I had something
I wanted to tell you

50:39.570 --> 50:42.820
but you have to promise not to get mad.

50:43.710 --> 50:45.377
- Famous last words.

50:47.036 --> 50:50.432
This better be good news
on a night like this.

50:50.432 --> 50:53.057
- It is good news for me

50:53.057 --> 50:56.137
and hopefully it'll be
good news for you too.

50:56.137 --> 50:57.470
- Okay, do tell.

50:59.261 --> 51:02.325
- Maybe you should sit down.

51:02.325 --> 51:05.075
- Why don't we sit down together.

51:07.145 --> 51:10.072
- Okay, just come right out and say it.

51:10.072 --> 51:11.489
Dad, I'm in love.

51:14.306 --> 51:17.556
- Oh Theo, my goodness, you're only 17.

51:22.509 --> 51:24.763
Okay, who's the lucky guy?

51:24.763 --> 51:27.088
Is he someone from our ward?

51:27.088 --> 51:30.755
This is what you've
been so reclusive about.

51:31.828 --> 51:32.661
It's fine.

51:33.895 --> 51:34.934
We'll meet his parents

51:34.934 --> 51:37.603
and you can start courting
each other properly

51:37.603 --> 51:39.641
without being in the shadows.

51:39.641 --> 51:40.474
It'll all be just--

51:40.474 --> 51:41.724
- [Pamela] Sir.

51:47.887 --> 51:49.720
- Dad, this is Pamela.

51:52.385 --> 51:54.302
I love her and I'm gay.

51:57.432 --> 51:58.734
I just couldn't hide it anymore

51:58.734 --> 52:00.011
and I thought it'd be better to tell you

52:00.011 --> 52:03.434
than for you to find out another way.

52:03.434 --> 52:04.981
I'm gay dad.

52:04.981 --> 52:07.246
I always have been.

52:07.246 --> 52:08.351
I know it's a lot to take in

52:08.351 --> 52:11.525
and it's gonna be hard to understand.

52:11.525 --> 52:13.858
Pamela is an amazing person.

52:14.815 --> 52:16.982
She makes me happy.

52:16.982 --> 52:18.065
She saved me.

52:18.901 --> 52:23.544
- Mr. Doran, I know this is a
really important time for you

52:23.544 --> 52:25.329
but I promise with all of my heart

52:25.329 --> 52:27.769
that I will make your daughter happy.

52:27.769 --> 52:29.560
She's the light of my life.

52:29.560 --> 52:34.444
She's turned my whole
perspective of life around.

52:34.444 --> 52:35.694
- How dare you?

52:37.534 --> 52:40.019
I recognize you, you're
that maid from next door,

52:40.019 --> 52:41.371
the Johnson's place.

52:41.371 --> 52:43.038
How in the, what in,

52:45.597 --> 52:49.338
Theo, do you have any
idea what you're saying?

52:49.338 --> 52:51.255
This is an abomination.

52:51.255 --> 52:55.057
To give up a temple
marriage, I don't understand.

52:55.057 --> 52:57.139
This will not work for a child of mine.

52:57.139 --> 52:59.092
I refuse to accept this.

52:59.092 --> 53:02.253
And you, how dare you
come in here to my house

53:02.253 --> 53:05.488
and taint the very walls and
foundation with your evil.

53:05.488 --> 53:06.883
You have corrupted my daughter.

53:06.883 --> 53:07.716
- I'm sorry sir.

53:07.716 --> 53:09.874
Please I never meant to.

53:09.874 --> 53:11.514
- Oh, you didn't mean to.

53:11.514 --> 53:14.424
Well you did and now you
have to pay the price.

53:14.424 --> 53:17.221
You have tainted my daughter
and made her impure.

53:17.221 --> 53:19.774
You seductive witch, you
probably seduced her.

53:19.774 --> 53:22.755
- Dad, she did nothing wrong.

53:22.755 --> 53:24.566
It wasn't her.

53:24.566 --> 53:25.699
This is who I am.

53:25.699 --> 53:27.264
I chose her.

53:27.264 --> 53:30.139
She accepts me for who I am.

53:30.139 --> 53:33.871
- If you choose this
path you're dead to me.

53:33.871 --> 53:36.112
Do you understand me?

53:36.112 --> 53:37.551
I would rather have you die,

53:37.551 --> 53:39.639
in fact I would rather be dead myself

53:39.639 --> 53:42.191
than have a daughter who's gay.

53:42.191 --> 53:43.492
Mark my words.

53:43.492 --> 53:45.427
- What happened to my punk rock dad?

53:45.427 --> 53:47.288
What happened to him?

53:47.288 --> 53:48.788
This is so unfair.

53:50.708 --> 53:52.160
- What are you still doing here?

53:52.160 --> 53:54.577
Get out, get out of my sight!

53:57.777 --> 54:01.944
Theo, just go to your room
and pray on this, okay.

54:06.202 --> 54:09.117
Look there are places that we can go

54:09.117 --> 54:11.331
that we can have you cured of this.

54:11.331 --> 54:13.833
Everything's gonna be okay.

54:13.833 --> 54:14.666
All right.

54:14.666 --> 54:15.680
- I hate you.

54:15.680 --> 54:16.597
I hate you!

54:17.758 --> 54:18.707
I wish I had died.

54:18.707 --> 54:20.707
You'll never understand.

54:21.727 --> 54:24.215
I know about you and mom.

54:24.215 --> 54:26.908
You're such a hypocrite.

54:26.908 --> 54:29.880
I know about how you two
met and how it came to be.

54:29.880 --> 54:32.206
Just imagine if that were to get out.

54:32.206 --> 54:36.289
How I could expose your
precious little campaign.

54:46.297 --> 54:50.082
- Let me get this straight
so that there's no confusion,

54:50.082 --> 54:51.875
you told your daughter

54:51.875 --> 54:54.227
after she came out to you as a lesbian

54:54.227 --> 54:57.576
and introduced you to her, the maid,

54:57.576 --> 55:00.144
that you'd rather she be dead
than accept the situation.

55:00.144 --> 55:02.268
- Wait, wait, that's
completely out of context.

55:02.268 --> 55:04.508
He's clearly, clearly upset.

55:04.508 --> 55:06.261
You don't have to answer that one.

55:06.261 --> 55:07.261
- It's okay.

55:08.128 --> 55:11.545
Look I know it was harsh, I was so livid,

55:12.521 --> 55:14.657
you have no idea how
much it ruined my night

55:14.657 --> 55:17.939
let alone how much it would
ruin my career as a politician.

55:17.939 --> 55:22.439
But I swear to you, I would
never hurt my little girl.

55:24.085 --> 55:25.907
I was trying to help her.

55:25.907 --> 55:28.990
I wanted to do what was best for her.

55:30.713 --> 55:34.248
If I wanted to hurt her why
would I tell you what I said.

55:34.248 --> 55:36.079
- He makes a point Joanna,

55:36.079 --> 55:38.217
if he were involved in her disappearance

55:38.217 --> 55:40.666
he sure as shit wouldn't
have admitted to saying that.

55:40.666 --> 55:44.119
- Hobbs, I have other questions to ask.

55:44.119 --> 55:47.407
All right let's, let's
go a different direction.

55:47.407 --> 55:50.324
What do you know about Pam, Pamela?

55:53.680 --> 55:55.420
- Not much really.

55:55.420 --> 55:59.246
I know she was the maid at
the Johnson's place next door.

55:59.246 --> 56:03.498
She couldn't have been more than 20 maybe.

56:03.498 --> 56:05.498
Oh and I've always heard rumors,

56:05.498 --> 56:10.025
that well Mr. Johnson likes
to hire maids and landscapers

56:10.025 --> 56:11.276
under the table, you know.

56:11.276 --> 56:15.873
So who knows if any of these
people even have paperwork.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.869
All I know is she seduced my daughter.

56:18.869 --> 56:21.536
This whole thing is a nightmare.

56:23.425 --> 56:25.880
- Do you have any other
questions for my client?

56:25.880 --> 56:27.442
Because unless you're going to arrest him

56:27.442 --> 56:29.215
or hold him as a suspect,

56:29.215 --> 56:31.548
I suggest you let him leave.

56:35.127 --> 56:36.544
Let's go William.

56:47.450 --> 56:48.946
- [Jay] So I saw that plaque over there,

56:48.946 --> 56:50.706
I guess you were in the CIA?

56:50.706 --> 56:53.378
- [Mr. Johnson] 30
years, field operations.

56:53.378 --> 56:54.646
How about you?

56:54.646 --> 56:57.876
- Lieutenant United States
Navy Shadow Walkers.

56:57.876 --> 56:59.090
- Black Ops.

56:59.090 --> 57:00.177
- Patches off.

57:00.177 --> 57:01.393
- How long?

57:01.393 --> 57:03.893
- Oh, you're never really out.

57:05.649 --> 57:08.732
- Well thank you for all that you do.

57:10.427 --> 57:14.010
- Oh and thank you for
all that you didn't.

57:15.362 --> 57:20.362
- Gentleman could we just get
down to the business at hand.

57:20.683 --> 57:22.600
- More tea Mr. Johnson?

57:28.680 --> 57:30.324
- That'll be all for now Kitty.

57:30.324 --> 57:31.241
- Yes, sir.

57:36.057 --> 57:39.186
- Jesus Christ Kitty, this tea is cold.

57:39.186 --> 57:40.353
What the hell?

57:42.112 --> 57:44.193
- I'm sorry sir.

57:44.193 --> 57:45.610
- The tea's fine.

57:47.709 --> 57:49.198
- Leave the detectives their tea

57:49.198 --> 57:53.120
but mine is lukewarm, bring me another.

57:53.120 --> 57:56.203
Don't mind Kitty, her family is dead.

57:57.623 --> 58:00.259
This job gives her a bit of purpose.

58:00.259 --> 58:02.759
Just trying to pay it forward.

58:04.266 --> 58:05.099
- Right.

58:06.535 --> 58:09.681
Okay, Mr. Johnson tell us how
you know your maid Pamela,

58:09.681 --> 58:12.431
I mean when did you see her last?

58:13.391 --> 58:15.621
- I haven't seen her in days.

58:15.621 --> 58:19.184
Needless to say, she has been fired.

58:19.184 --> 58:24.184
- Oh God, how hard it is to get
good hired help around here.

58:25.578 --> 58:28.245
- Okay, where did she come from?

58:29.185 --> 58:32.944
Or I mean how did you go about hiring her?

58:32.944 --> 58:35.870
- She came highly
recommended from a friend.

58:35.870 --> 58:38.413
While she was here she was superb.

58:38.413 --> 58:41.330
Hardworking and kept her head down.

58:42.570 --> 58:44.634
An atrocity really that she would leave us

58:44.634 --> 58:46.680
in a lurch like this.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.013
- Do you know her last name?

58:54.542 --> 58:58.125
- I think her last name
was Silva or Salva.

59:00.293 --> 59:02.749
Oh hell, I don't know maybe it was Santos,

59:02.749 --> 59:03.979
I can't remember.

59:03.979 --> 59:07.078
- All right, so I'm assuming
that she's here illegally

59:07.078 --> 59:08.766
since you don't know her last name

59:08.766 --> 59:11.431
and you probably didn't even
bother getting a visa for her.

59:11.431 --> 59:13.483
- What do you mean?

59:13.483 --> 59:16.285
Who do you think you are?

59:16.285 --> 59:17.527
What are you going to do,

59:17.527 --> 59:21.600
get your absurd social
media happy president

59:21.600 --> 59:23.183
to deport my staff?

59:24.427 --> 59:26.468
Well you can just get
the hell out of here.

59:26.468 --> 59:30.366
- No, no, we are here
investigating a missing girl.

59:30.366 --> 59:32.145
Now possibly even two missing girls.

59:32.145 --> 59:33.435
We're trying to help.

59:33.435 --> 59:37.685
We believe that one of
those girls could be Pamela.

59:40.130 --> 59:42.268
- Well I'll be dammed.

59:42.268 --> 59:44.018
- That's not all sir.

59:45.018 --> 59:47.178
And article of clothing at the crime scene

59:47.178 --> 59:49.702
the blood on it tested
positive to be of the daughter

59:49.702 --> 59:52.729
of your next door neighbor Theo Doran.

59:52.729 --> 59:55.982
More blood at the scene
we suspect was Pamela's.

59:55.982 --> 59:58.982
They were some sort of relationship.

01:00:00.436 --> 01:00:02.212
- Bull shit Pamela.

01:00:02.212 --> 01:00:03.788
When would she of had the time?

01:00:03.788 --> 01:00:06.455
I mean, oh God, that Will Doran,

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:12.669
he would do anything for
the love of money and power.

01:00:12.669 --> 01:00:16.260
And if his daughter Theo
was anything like him

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:19.560
well good riddance if you ask me.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.687
And as far as Pamela
goes she probably raked

01:00:22.687 --> 01:00:27.607
in all the money I gave her
and took it home to Brazil.

01:00:27.607 --> 01:00:28.440
- Right.

01:00:30.925 --> 01:00:31.842
We're done.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.790
(laughing)

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:46.633
Oh my God, that man is such an ass.

01:00:46.633 --> 01:00:49.177
- Yeah, tell me something
I don't already know.

01:00:49.177 --> 01:00:51.193
- You know could you
for one second pretend

01:00:51.193 --> 01:00:53.751
to have some semblance of common courtesy.

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:55.966
- I got it out of him.

01:00:55.966 --> 01:00:57.063
- You know what you need to do now.

01:00:57.063 --> 01:00:59.311
- I'm already checking
on flights to Brazil.

01:00:59.311 --> 01:01:00.311
- Thank you.

01:01:01.526 --> 01:01:03.767
Ingrid do you have any other findings

01:01:03.767 --> 01:01:05.068
or results for this case?

01:01:05.068 --> 01:01:09.601
I mean the more we dig the
more complex it's getting.

01:01:09.601 --> 01:01:12.934
We've got a angry Dad who is, has motive

01:01:13.806 --> 01:01:16.761
but why would he tell us that?

01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:18.903
I don't know it's just so bizarre.

01:01:18.903 --> 01:01:20.434
We're missing something.

01:01:20.434 --> 01:01:22.519
- Yeah, right now we specialists looking

01:01:22.519 --> 01:01:25.183
into the blood splatter.

01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:27.003
I have no conclusive results

01:01:27.003 --> 01:01:29.441
about the other individual's DNA.

01:01:29.441 --> 01:01:32.073
Without a match we have nothing

01:01:32.073 --> 01:01:35.561
but I did get the fingerprints
back from the letter

01:01:35.561 --> 01:01:36.895
and they were Theo's.

01:01:36.895 --> 01:01:40.790
There were no other
fingerprints to analyze though.

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:42.458
I'm so sorry Joanna.

01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:44.873
If there's anything else I
find I will let you know.

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:46.674
- Thanks Ingrid you're a life saver.

01:01:46.674 --> 01:01:49.140
Maybe literally in this case.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.002
All right I'll see you later.

01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:51.305
- See ya.

01:01:51.305 --> 01:01:53.972
- [Detective Stanley] Thank you.

01:01:55.706 --> 01:01:58.206
(light music)

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:08.765
(vocalizing)

01:02:08.765 --> 01:02:10.136
- You are a deserving human being

01:02:10.136 --> 01:02:13.792
that has received love
from another human being.

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:15.459
You are unstoppable.

01:02:17.593 --> 01:02:21.022
You've given love and
you've received love.

01:02:21.022 --> 01:02:23.163
You've done it Theo.

01:02:23.163 --> 01:02:24.913
The future is bright.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:29.208
You own the sky.

01:02:35.361 --> 01:02:37.175
(fist thuds)

01:02:37.175 --> 01:02:38.528
- [Masked Man] This is for Shandra.

01:02:38.528 --> 01:02:39.361
- Stop.

01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:41.944
- [Masked Man] That girl in the bathroom.

01:02:41.944 --> 01:02:44.777
Shut up, shut up, let this happen.

01:02:47.486 --> 01:02:49.819
(screaming)

01:02:51.552 --> 01:02:54.010
If you tell anyone about
this I will kill you.

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:55.343
I will kill you!

01:02:56.958 --> 01:02:59.291
(screaming)

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:04.538
- [Pamela] Misty, grab
the gauze and peroxide

01:03:04.538 --> 01:03:09.538
will need to clean the wounds
and wrap them when she's done.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.192
- [Misty] What kind of
monster would do this?

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:17.100
[Pamela] We're not sure.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.081
He was masked.

01:03:19.081 --> 01:03:20.461
- [Misty] Did you call the police?

01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:22.711
- No she doesn't want that.

01:03:26.919 --> 01:03:28.577
Isn't this American?

01:03:28.577 --> 01:03:30.318
He can't get away with this

01:03:30.318 --> 01:03:32.818
especially with the whole Me Too thing.

01:03:32.818 --> 01:03:35.013
- I can't risk this getting out.

01:03:35.013 --> 01:03:36.513
I feel so trapped.

01:03:38.596 --> 01:03:41.767
Not only will be told that
this is why (mumbles),

01:03:41.767 --> 01:03:43.684
considered tainted now.

01:03:45.064 --> 01:03:47.936
My father always expected
a temple marriage

01:03:47.936 --> 01:03:50.603
after this, he's expect so much.

01:03:52.587 --> 01:03:54.670
(crying)

01:04:03.169 --> 01:04:05.352
(door knocking)

01:04:05.352 --> 01:04:08.852
- [Mr. Johnson] Is everything okay Pamela?

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.662
- Tia, I have to talk to you.

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:27.096
- Knocking.

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:29.613
- Tia, you've been my best
friend since forever please.

01:04:29.613 --> 01:04:32.280
- [Tia] And this better be good.

01:04:33.147 --> 01:04:36.397
- I don't know how to say this, my God,

01:04:39.962 --> 01:04:41.950
I was violated yesterday.

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:43.203
- [Tia] What do you mean violated?

01:04:43.203 --> 01:04:44.036
- I was raped.

01:04:44.036 --> 01:04:46.786
(dramatic music)

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:49.118
I was raped.

01:04:50.704 --> 01:04:53.204
And I think I know who it was.

01:04:55.302 --> 01:04:56.135
What do I do?

01:04:56.135 --> 01:04:57.546
I mean who does--
- Wait, wait, wait,

01:04:57.546 --> 01:04:59.213
slow down.
- I can't.

01:05:12.915 --> 01:05:15.039
- You might wanna look into
that sensitivity course

01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:17.431
we talked about online.

01:05:17.431 --> 01:05:18.391
Ingrid, hi.

01:05:18.391 --> 01:05:19.224
- Hi.
- Got you call,

01:05:19.224 --> 01:05:20.057
what's so important?

01:05:20.057 --> 01:05:21.403
- So we've looked at the blood splatter

01:05:21.403 --> 01:05:24.794
and it appears that it's
been self inflicted.

01:05:24.794 --> 01:05:26.866
- I told you wasn't a slash and dash.

01:05:26.866 --> 01:05:27.809
- What do you mean?

01:05:27.809 --> 01:05:30.366
- Well there were no
blood clots at the scene,

01:05:30.366 --> 01:05:34.199
which indicates that it
was swift and violent.

01:05:34.199 --> 01:05:38.197
With a perpetrator the blood
spray is usually a fine mist

01:05:38.197 --> 01:05:40.493
and it wasn't, it was contained

01:05:40.493 --> 01:05:43.969
and it was big and there were less drops.

01:05:43.969 --> 01:05:45.656
Without a body I don't--

01:05:45.656 --> 01:05:47.414
- So you don't think
this is a murder at all.

01:05:47.414 --> 01:05:51.341
- There's no body, there's no
perpetrator, no guns shots,

01:05:51.341 --> 01:05:53.322
I'm just as confused as you are.

01:05:53.322 --> 01:05:55.071
- Okay, well thanks Ingrid.

01:05:55.071 --> 01:05:55.916
- Thanks.
- Okay.

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:57.794
See you later.
- See ya.

01:05:57.794 --> 01:06:00.544
(dramatic music)

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:17.355
- (mumbles).

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.753
(screaming)

01:06:33.478 --> 01:06:34.311
Jessica.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.535
(crying)

01:06:41.535 --> 01:06:43.035
Oh, my sweet girl.

01:06:48.918 --> 01:06:49.835
Oh, please.

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:17.179
(laughing)

01:07:17.179 --> 01:07:19.991
- Dude you should of seen it man,

01:07:19.991 --> 01:07:22.576
she was squealing like a pig.

01:07:22.576 --> 01:07:24.526
She didn't even know what hit her.

01:07:24.526 --> 01:07:26.585
(laughing)

01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:28.848
J Dog hit her hard.

01:07:28.848 --> 01:07:29.681
And you know what?

01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:31.397
Screw her dad.

01:07:31.397 --> 01:07:32.663
(laughing)

01:07:32.663 --> 01:07:34.218
- You sick bastard.

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:37.546
You get way too much
ass for your own good.

01:07:37.546 --> 01:07:41.546
- Hey do you guys think
I could get a ride home?

01:07:42.755 --> 01:07:44.675
- Dude what the hell you can't,

01:07:44.675 --> 01:07:47.425
you can't make it on a 0.5 limit.

01:07:50.557 --> 01:07:53.677
- Hey J Dog, heard you like it hot.

01:07:53.677 --> 01:07:55.920
Think you can hit this hard?

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.732
- Heard he makes girls moan

01:07:57.732 --> 01:08:00.209
till they're howling at the moon.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.237
- Are you boys looking to party?

01:08:02.237 --> 01:08:03.656
- Who's asking?

01:08:03.656 --> 01:08:05.434
And how do you know about me?

01:08:05.434 --> 01:08:08.054
- Word gets around when you do it right.

01:08:08.054 --> 01:08:11.509
- Oh, shit, can't argue with that.

01:08:11.509 --> 01:08:14.092
Where you fine ladies wanna go?

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:18.881
(laughing)

01:08:18.881 --> 01:08:21.612
- Hey bro, get me another beer.

01:08:21.612 --> 01:08:23.029
Right bro.
- Yeah.

01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:31.734
- Well hello.

01:08:33.263 --> 01:08:36.274
- I bet you're a naughty boy.

01:08:36.274 --> 01:08:37.435
- [Jacob] Oh.

01:08:37.435 --> 01:08:41.566
- [Long Nose Masked Woman]
I think you need a spanking.

01:08:41.566 --> 01:08:43.066

Pass that shit over.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.334
Oh, oh, oh, my God, wow.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:58.673
That has got some kick to it.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.520

01:09:16.965 --> 01:09:21.465

01:11:05.778 --> 01:11:07.537
- Give me that wine.

01:11:07.537 --> 01:11:08.725
- Wait.
- Wait a minute,

01:11:08.725 --> 01:11:11.860
hey you haven't had a
drink in like a decade.

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.897
- And would you guys rather
have me popping my happy pills?

01:11:14.897 --> 01:11:16.938
I'm not stupid ladies.

01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:18.223
I know I've been a foul

01:11:18.223 --> 01:11:20.320
and I've buried all these years

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.111
in opioids and antidepressants.

01:11:23.111 --> 01:11:24.799

How is Theo?

01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:48.117
- Theo, she has been
doing much better lately.

01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:52.547
From what I've seen she's been smiling.

01:11:52.547 --> 01:11:53.822
- Well cheers to that.

01:11:53.822 --> 01:11:56.405
- Cheers to that.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:00.966
- This is good.

01:12:00.966 --> 01:12:04.133
- Yes, you know in all honesty ladies,

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.123
I love you for who you are.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:10.331
Pills or no pills, drinks or no drinks.

01:12:10.331 --> 01:12:12.374
Heck God or no gods.

01:12:12.374 --> 01:12:15.401
Okay, the important thing is that we,

01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:16.713
we need to stick together.

01:12:16.713 --> 01:12:18.681
Okay, I don't wanna be those women

01:12:18.681 --> 01:12:21.345
that they drift apart just
because they have lives

01:12:21.345 --> 01:12:23.926
and they get busy, okay.

01:12:23.926 --> 01:12:26.259
Promise me, promise me that.

01:12:27.231 --> 01:12:28.118
- Well I'm in.

01:12:28.118 --> 01:12:30.180
You ladies get me through anything.

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.287
- Yeah, cheers to that.

01:12:32.287 --> 01:12:35.109
- Cheers to that.
- Okay, I will drink to that.

01:12:35.109 --> 01:12:37.359
(laughing)

01:12:38.856 --> 01:12:40.099
- Will you guys marry me?

01:12:40.099 --> 01:12:41.364
- Group hug.

01:12:41.364 --> 01:12:42.625
(laughing)

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:43.458
- That's my earring.

01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:45.708
(laughing)

01:12:46.618 --> 01:12:47.928
- Oh, my god.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:51.857
- Brother Doran, we're so excited
to see what's gonna happen

01:12:51.857 --> 01:12:53.610
to your campaign.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:55.400
It's great to see again.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.130
It seems this is God's will, Will.

01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:59.544
(laughing)

01:12:59.544 --> 01:13:02.711
Oh man, you have God behind you Elder.

01:13:04.248 --> 01:13:07.577
- Thank you, I'm happy to hear that.

01:13:07.577 --> 01:13:09.994
I'm afraid there's a problem.

01:13:13.585 --> 01:13:15.499
My heart is breaking

01:13:15.499 --> 01:13:20.499
and I don't know if I have
the strength to keep going.

01:13:20.651 --> 01:13:22.305
- Whatever can it be?

01:13:22.305 --> 01:13:26.973
Surely with God on our side we
can find a solution together.

01:13:26.973 --> 01:13:30.473
- Well, last night after my campaign party

01:13:32.715 --> 01:13:36.632
my daughter broke some
pretty awful news to me.

01:13:38.734 --> 01:13:43.177
Not only is she gay but
she's in a relationship

01:13:43.177 --> 01:13:45.177
with the girl next door.

01:13:51.157 --> 01:13:53.074
What have I done wrong?

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:57.046
I have sacrificed everything for her.

01:13:57.931 --> 01:14:01.598
I'm so confused and
angry to tell the truth.

01:14:02.817 --> 01:14:07.234
- This is a, this is not
the news I was anticipating.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:12.421
This is heart wrenching indeed.

01:14:12.421 --> 01:14:14.241
And she told you this.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.074
- Yes.

01:14:16.169 --> 01:14:19.682
And there were words said
that shouldn't have been said

01:14:19.682 --> 01:14:21.015
but I was angry.

01:14:24.738 --> 01:14:25.905
What can I do?

01:14:27.784 --> 01:14:29.503
I love my daughter with all my heart

01:14:29.503 --> 01:14:31.336
but I can't love this.

01:14:32.703 --> 01:14:35.368
- Surely this can't be
good for your campaign.

01:14:35.368 --> 01:14:37.511
- I'm not even worried
about the campaign anymore.

01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:41.678
She is throwing away
everything I ever taught her.

01:14:43.015 --> 01:14:46.265
- You ever heard of conversion therapy?

01:14:49.442 --> 01:14:51.666
Basically it's like a retreat

01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:55.311
for you know other girls her own age

01:14:55.311 --> 01:14:58.201
struggling with her disorder.

01:14:58.201 --> 01:15:00.415
I mean she could just disappear

01:15:00.415 --> 01:15:04.415
and be reborn and cured
of all these tendencies.

01:15:09.657 --> 01:15:11.791
- I already thought of that.

01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:13.611
I'm just still trying to grasp the fact

01:15:13.611 --> 01:15:16.694
that she not what I raised her to be.

01:15:19.829 --> 01:15:22.106
- [Bishop McKenzie] You
must fast and pray on it

01:15:22.106 --> 01:15:25.197
and with God's help she'll
come back into the light.

01:15:25.197 --> 01:15:29.988
And I mean she still has
a lot to give to a husband

01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:32.190
and to her future kids.

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:34.175
And she has a beautiful role

01:15:34.175 --> 01:15:36.143
to play in the Celestial Kingdom.

01:15:36.143 --> 01:15:37.501
Does she not?

01:15:37.501 --> 01:15:41.418
- Yes, yes, she's so
smart, and so independent,

01:15:43.249 --> 01:15:47.489
so I guess I really I haven't
thought of it beyond that

01:15:47.489 --> 01:15:51.322
but she's just my child
and I love who she is.

01:15:54.019 --> 01:15:58.269
Does this, does this really
make her any different?

01:15:59.196 --> 01:16:04.029
I mean is she suddenly not the
same person I always loved?

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:09.087
- The youth of today,
they're easily corrupt.

01:16:09.087 --> 01:16:12.693
I mean mark my words
she may be your daughter

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.610
and you may dote on her

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.124
but surely she's not without sin

01:16:17.124 --> 01:16:22.124
and definitely not without
the need of our Lord's grace.

01:16:22.431 --> 01:16:25.046
We could all use grace Brother Doran.

01:16:25.046 --> 01:16:26.546
We're all sinners.

01:16:29.025 --> 01:16:29.858
- Indeed.

01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:32.680
But I'm out of ideas.

01:16:33.595 --> 01:16:35.845
She just seemed so perfect.

01:16:39.748 --> 01:16:43.477
She was just a child with
top of her class grades,

01:16:43.477 --> 01:16:45.227
popularity and charm.

01:16:47.622 --> 01:16:50.222
Now she just seems so broken.

01:16:50.222 --> 01:16:53.722
- Well we, we're all broken Brother Doran.

01:16:56.348 --> 01:17:00.098
Each and everyone of us
in this city of salt.

01:17:04.522 --> 01:17:08.105
- Jay, I've got nothing
left for this case.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:13.219
All right, did you check
the flights to Brazil?

01:17:13.219 --> 01:17:14.688
- [Jay] Yes.

01:17:14.688 --> 01:17:17.296
- And the search parties
and the volunteers.

01:17:17.296 --> 01:17:20.657
- Came up empty handed, nothing.

01:17:20.657 --> 01:17:22.459
- What about the homes
that we got warrants for,

01:17:22.459 --> 01:17:24.146
including the Doran's?

01:17:24.146 --> 01:17:25.771
- Nothing was very useful.

01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:26.885
Nothing expect for the journal

01:17:26.885 --> 01:17:29.069
we got of Theo Doran's
that her mother gave us.

01:17:29.069 --> 01:17:32.812
Full poetic ramblings, that
girl was a neurotic mess.

01:17:32.812 --> 01:17:34.569
- I would be.

01:17:34.569 --> 01:17:36.714
What do you mean by poetic ramblings?

01:17:36.714 --> 01:17:40.336
- Just emo goth stuff, Pagan witchcraft

01:17:40.336 --> 01:17:41.520
as far as I could tell.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.708
- What the hell?

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:46.138
- Yeah, just you know I love you this,

01:17:46.138 --> 01:17:48.070
we're bound to the earth with that.

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:51.043
Just razor blades of love kind of stuff.

01:17:51.043 --> 01:17:53.710
- Well it's clear what happened.

01:17:54.636 --> 01:17:56.719
I just, those footprints.

01:17:58.045 --> 01:18:00.329
- Those footprints are not a red herring.

01:18:00.329 --> 01:18:02.044
- I don't want another goddamn cold case

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.953
hanging over our heads.

01:18:03.953 --> 01:18:06.245
- If you're interested in
chasing down those footprints

01:18:06.245 --> 01:18:08.191
any further be my guest.

01:18:08.191 --> 01:18:09.941
- Lock it down Hobbs.

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:14.372
I'm gonna have to call Mr. Doran.

01:18:14.372 --> 01:18:15.584
- [Jay] Why are you calling him?

01:18:15.584 --> 01:18:17.834
- Because I have more tact.

01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:22.053
We're out of leads.

01:18:22.053 --> 01:18:25.636
And from the looks of
it from the forensics

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:30.328
his daughter took her own life.

01:18:30.328 --> 01:18:33.781
The evidence, the raging water that day,

01:18:33.781 --> 01:18:36.253
the bodies must have been swept downstream

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:38.526
and carried underground.

01:18:38.526 --> 01:18:39.920
This case is cold.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.670
(dramatic music)

01:18:44.528 --> 01:18:46.945
- Then we close as a suicide.

01:18:49.323 --> 01:18:50.990
- Anything but that.

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:06.980
- Dad, hey Dad.

01:19:11.598 --> 01:19:13.545
Dad this is important.

01:19:13.545 --> 01:19:15.128
- What is it Jacob?

01:19:16.777 --> 01:19:20.694
- I, I did something I
really regret yesterday.

01:19:25.937 --> 01:19:29.037
I mean one moment I'm throwing a football

01:19:29.037 --> 01:19:32.204
and the next I'm roped into this thing

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:36.152
and Shandra needed some protection.

01:19:39.837 --> 01:19:44.837
- And why shouldn't you protect
your innocent little sister?

01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:51.246
- I'm not saying I
shouldn't defend Shandra,

01:19:54.637 --> 01:19:57.970
I just did something really, really bad.

01:19:59.032 --> 01:20:00.015
- [Bishop McKenzie] Is this something

01:20:00.015 --> 01:20:03.202
you're gonna get
suspended from school for?

01:20:03.202 --> 01:20:05.420
- No, I just I--
- Is it something

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:09.753
that's gonna have a bad
impact on the upcoming game?

01:20:11.904 --> 01:20:14.487
- I don't know but--
- Be a man.

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:19.650
You have your whole life ahead of you

01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:22.060
you're my prized son.

01:20:23.763 --> 01:20:24.596

01:20:25.884 --> 01:20:28.359
You're the one chosen to
lead this football team.

01:20:28.359 --> 01:20:31.231
So I suggest whatever
it is you use your wits

01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:33.481
and logic to get rid of it.

01:20:35.057 --> 01:20:38.170

community you need to man up

01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:40.337

Don't you think Will would want you

01:31:04.892 --> 01:31:07.137
to spend the night celebrating his life

01:31:07.137 --> 01:31:08.926
instead of mourning it?

01:31:08.926 --> 01:31:11.571
- Yeah Jessica, come with us please.

01:31:11.571 --> 01:31:13.654
- Yeah we have chocolate.

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:19.533
- No babies, I need to
be here with my husband

01:31:20.637 --> 01:31:23.220
long as I can, pay my respects.

01:31:25.821 --> 01:31:29.635
- Okay, come on girls,
let's give her some space.

01:31:29.635 --> 01:31:33.302
But if you need anything
and I mean anything

01:31:34.147 --> 01:31:35.907
call me, you text me,

01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:39.724
I will have my phone next to me all night.

01:31:39.724 --> 01:31:41.280
- [Jessica] I love you Jane.

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.780
- I love you Jess.

01:31:45.588 --> 01:31:47.297
- You are such a good friend.

01:31:47.297 --> 01:31:50.291
- We're gonna get through this together.

01:31:50.291 --> 01:31:52.512
- Please let me have my time.

01:31:52.512 --> 01:31:53.512
- Of course.

01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:56.171
- Thank you.

01:33:07.491 --> 01:33:09.268
- Stop Jessica, stop!

01:33:09.268 --> 01:33:10.435
- Mr. Johnson.

01:33:17.307 --> 01:33:21.640
- Jessica, if I had known
that this was gonna happen

01:33:23.661 --> 01:33:27.078
I would have told you sooner, believe me.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.520
One night I was going
through my business papers

01:33:34.847 --> 01:33:38.264
and I heard a commotion
in Pamela's bathroom.

01:33:38.264 --> 01:33:40.519
(door knocking)

01:33:40.519 --> 01:33:42.686
You okay in there, Pamela?

01:33:44.574 --> 01:33:46.372
What the hell's going on?

01:33:46.372 --> 01:33:48.955
- It's, my friend was attacked.

01:33:52.289 --> 01:33:55.245
- Well, meet me in the
study when you finish

01:33:55.245 --> 01:33:57.495
getting cleaned up in here.

01:34:16.394 --> 01:34:19.629
- Mr. Johnson, this is my dear
friend Theo from next door.

01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:21.191
- I'm not blind.

01:34:21.191 --> 01:34:24.570
I see you two coming and going
around here all the time.

01:34:24.570 --> 01:34:27.271
- Sir, does that mean that
you know what's going on?

01:34:27.271 --> 01:34:31.767
- Well I do know that you two
are very found of each other.

01:34:31.767 --> 01:34:36.521
And it's also apparent that
something bad has happened.

01:34:36.521 --> 01:34:38.953
Theo, I must tell you right off

01:34:38.953 --> 01:34:41.786
that I am not found of your father

01:34:42.784 --> 01:34:47.367
but I also know that you're
not a clone of your father.

01:34:48.534 --> 01:34:51.847
You know I am not the cold hearted bastard

01:34:51.847 --> 01:34:53.514
that I appear to be.

01:34:54.508 --> 01:34:56.591
So tell me what ails you?

01:34:58.196 --> 01:35:01.529
And Pamela you are like a daughter to me

01:35:02.375 --> 01:35:05.542
so if you can vouch for Theo so can I.

01:35:08.346 --> 01:35:11.013
- But sir--
- I have connections.

01:35:13.519 --> 01:35:16.250
You're here for a reason Pamela.

01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:20.667
I appreciate your work but
I can also relate, try me.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:28.100
- Well I met her and this is a long story.

01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:32.670
(light music)

01:35:34.779 --> 01:35:37.810
- [Mr. Johnson] Kitty, would
you bring us some tea please.

01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:40.999
- I'm actually LDS sir, I don't drink tea.

01:35:40.999 --> 01:35:43.648
- Just bring the tea, Kitty.

01:35:43.648 --> 01:35:45.815
- Yes sir, tea right away.

01:35:50.327 --> 01:35:53.725
- We have some very important
things to talk about.

01:35:53.725 --> 01:35:55.470
- Yes sir, I understand
that your a major supporter

01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:57.774
of our team at Zion, whatever you want.

01:35:57.774 --> 01:36:02.691
- It's no secret that you are
your father's prized all star

01:36:04.765 --> 01:36:08.092
and I have been following
your game as well.

01:36:08.092 --> 01:36:09.958
- Thank you, sir.

01:36:09.958 --> 01:36:13.958
- But I also know about
your little discrepancy.

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:21.826
- I'm not sure I know what you're--

01:36:21.826 --> 01:36:26.826
- [Mr. Johnson] You know exactly
what I'm talking about boy.

01:36:28.267 --> 01:36:29.378
- Did my dad talk to you?

01:36:29.378 --> 01:36:30.961
- [Mr. Johnson] No.

01:36:32.622 --> 01:36:33.787
- I think I should go.

01:36:33.787 --> 01:36:36.870
- If you value your father's opinion,

01:36:37.744 --> 01:36:41.077
if you value your reputation and future,

01:36:42.686 --> 01:36:45.519
if you value the love of the game,

01:36:48.199 --> 01:36:52.532
sit down, shut up, and
listen to what I have to say.

01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:02.271
As an outsider in this community

01:37:02.271 --> 01:37:06.913
but also a financial
supporter of this community

01:37:06.913 --> 01:37:08.746
I hear a lot of things

01:37:12.131 --> 01:37:14.464
some more petty than others.

01:37:17.166 --> 01:37:19.583
Utah has a very unique culture

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:23.486
and I wouldn't trade that for the world

01:37:23.486 --> 01:37:25.319
but what you have done

01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:32.541
let's just say you're going to pay for it.

01:37:33.472 --> 01:37:35.389
And not only pay for it

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:40.600
you're going to help me with this problem.

01:37:43.912 --> 01:37:44.745
- Okay.

01:37:52.857 --> 01:37:55.607
(dramatic music)

01:38:27.478 --> 01:38:28.750
- Are you ready?

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:30.180
- [Pamela] I'm ready.

01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:32.180
- Okay, let's disappear.

01:38:39.568 --> 01:38:42.651
- It is time ladies, all is in place.

01:38:44.269 --> 01:38:46.436
Are you sure you're ready?

01:38:58.092 --> 01:38:59.168
- [Jacob] Whoa, whoa.

01:38:59.168 --> 01:39:01.760
- Just a little security measure boy,

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.760
although nothing can forgive
what you have done to Theo.

01:39:07.057 --> 01:39:11.057
Taken her against her
will, taken her innocence.

01:39:12.576 --> 01:39:15.401
Well you can at least pay.

01:39:15.401 --> 01:39:18.147
Oh and understand some of the local women

01:39:18.147 --> 01:39:21.120
had their way with you too.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.935
This is something that
will hang over you always

01:39:25.935 --> 01:39:27.852
and I will always know.

01:39:30.956 --> 01:39:31.873
- Yes, sir.

01:39:34.915 --> 01:39:37.248
- Well do what most be done.

01:40:14.283 --> 01:40:15.116
Now Theo.

01:40:24.621 --> 01:40:25.871
- Ow!

01:40:25.871 --> 01:40:27.954
(crying)

01:40:36.373 --> 01:40:37.330
- [Jacob] Oh my God.

01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:39.134
(gagging)

01:40:39.134 --> 01:40:41.510
- This is the only way.

01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:44.819
The only way we can be together.

01:40:44.819 --> 01:40:48.276
- All is well ladies, I know this is hard

01:40:48.276 --> 01:40:50.741
but it must be convincing.

01:40:50.741 --> 01:40:53.061
There will be a car waiting up on the road

01:40:53.061 --> 01:40:55.150
with gauze bandages and other items

01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:56.983
to get you cleaned up.

01:40:58.407 --> 01:41:02.490
Isn't there something else
you have to say Jacob?

01:41:09.239 --> 01:41:11.277
- It's not as much as I feel like I owe

01:41:11.277 --> 01:41:13.944
but it's my entire life savings.

01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:21.336
I hope it can give you a new start.

01:41:21.336 --> 01:41:23.336
It's the least I can do.

01:41:24.215 --> 01:41:25.298
I'm so sorry.

01:41:32.579 --> 01:41:34.574
- Everything has been arranged ladies.

01:41:34.574 --> 01:41:38.042
Kitty will be waiting up
on the road in a black car

01:41:38.042 --> 01:41:40.168
there she'll have dry clothes

01:41:40.168 --> 01:41:43.575
and everything you'll
need to get cleaned up.

01:41:43.575 --> 01:41:46.492
Here is your new IDs and passports.

01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:50.816
Jacob, will you put that in the backpack?

01:41:50.816 --> 01:41:53.979
Pamela, you are know called Demi,

01:41:53.979 --> 01:41:56.146
Theo, you are now Theresa.

01:41:58.976 --> 01:42:03.726
And Jacob you have your
fingerprints all over the dagger,

01:42:05.728 --> 01:42:09.466
one word and I will
expose you to the world

01:42:09.466 --> 01:42:12.022
for your crime against women.

01:42:12.022 --> 01:42:14.083
- I understand.

01:42:14.083 --> 01:42:17.030
- Now we must make this look real.

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:20.780
Now drop your bloody
hoodie by your backpack.

01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:25.762
You need to let the blood
drip into the water.

01:42:25.762 --> 01:42:29.179
Now, take Pamela's backpack as we planned

01:42:30.131 --> 01:42:32.865
then meet Kitty on the road.

01:42:32.865 --> 01:42:33.865
Go, run now.

01:42:36.766 --> 01:42:39.659
We are all sinners Jacob.

01:42:39.659 --> 01:42:43.659
No matter differences in
religion or background,

01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:47.717
or love lives, we all have to answer

01:42:47.717 --> 01:42:50.050
to one another at some time.

01:42:52.538 --> 01:42:57.538
Tonight you have made a step
in the direction of justice.

01:42:57.666 --> 01:42:59.430
Your father would be proud.

01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:00.894
- Please, please don't tell him.

01:43:00.894 --> 01:43:04.107
- I won't, I won't, as
long as you understand

01:43:04.107 --> 01:43:06.993
that you never saw anything here.

01:43:06.993 --> 01:43:08.576
Not now, not never.

01:43:10.391 --> 01:43:12.302
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:43:12.302 --> 01:43:13.385
Now let's go.

01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:17.985
You have a game to prepare for

01:43:17.985 --> 01:43:21.152
and we all know how you love the game.

01:43:22.539 --> 01:43:24.539
Let's finish this thing.

01:43:26.692 --> 01:43:27.609
- Yes, sir.

01:44:19.221 --> 01:44:20.582
- So she's alive.

01:44:20.582 --> 01:44:22.332
- Yes, Theo is alive.

01:44:25.829 --> 01:44:28.739
- Okay, where's my daughter?

01:44:28.739 --> 01:44:29.989
- I don't know.

01:44:30.970 --> 01:44:33.653
However I do know that
she will get in touch

01:44:33.653 --> 01:44:36.126
with you when she's ready.

01:44:36.126 --> 01:44:40.209
And I also know that both
she and Pamela are safe

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:43.733
and free of judgment.

01:44:43.733 --> 01:44:46.478
This city is not yet ready for change

01:44:46.478 --> 01:44:50.895
but it will be soon with
the help of people like you.

01:44:51.831 --> 01:44:56.089
You need to be a light,
be a light for your peers,

01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:58.690
be a light for your community

01:44:58.690 --> 01:45:01.273
and be a light for your church.

01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:07.317
The night your husband killed himself

01:45:07.317 --> 01:45:11.857
I was headed over to your
house to tell him everything.

01:45:11.857 --> 01:45:14.801
I saw him driving away so I got in my car

01:45:14.801 --> 01:45:19.009
and I followed him but I
didn't know where he was going.

01:45:19.009 --> 01:45:22.856
I drove so aimlessly, I
drove to the police station,

01:45:22.856 --> 01:45:26.106
I drove, I drove to your Bishop's house

01:45:28.195 --> 01:45:30.602
but then it occurred to me

01:45:30.602 --> 01:45:34.231
he went to where Theo disappeared.

01:45:34.231 --> 01:45:36.420
I drove there as fast as I could

01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:39.419
but obviously I was too late.

01:45:39.419 --> 01:45:40.919
I'm, I'm so sorry.

01:45:42.519 --> 01:45:45.769
I should have know, I should have know.

01:45:55.214 --> 01:45:57.703
- I still don't know
what you want me to do.

01:45:57.703 --> 01:46:00.536
- I don't know what you should do.

01:46:02.269 --> 01:46:05.519
But you should do what's in your heart.

01:46:07.891 --> 01:46:11.149
Maybe you should run for senator.

01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:14.066
Make some real changes around here.

01:46:28.123 --> 01:46:30.623
