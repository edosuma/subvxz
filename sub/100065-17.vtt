WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:03.795
ABETEMARCO:
<i>It's not your fault</i>

00:03.878 --> 00:05.213
he's walking.

00:05.296 --> 00:07.048
Uh, you had no time to prepare.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.884
The D.A. should know you can't
rush a case like this.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.177
That's not gonna make
a difference

00:11.261 --> 00:13.054
to the families
of those victims.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.265
We'll get Costa
on something else.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.475
Yeah. The next
double homicide he commits?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.602
Well, hopefully not that.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.603
(knocking on door)

00:20.687 --> 00:22.313
I have Dr. Dornan to see you.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.275
Sorry to hear about
Michael Costa.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.944
He's already giving me
grief counseling.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.154
I may have something better.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.451
I've been consulting on
a related trial in your bureau.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.910
Donnie Hassett's.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.245
Wasn't he one

00:37.328 --> 00:39.247
of Costa's guys?

00:37.328 --> 00:39.247
ERIN: Yeah,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.458
but he fell out of favor
15 years ago?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.293
Still, he's not gonna
roll on him.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.420
He wants to now.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.420
And why is that?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.422
Hassett's case has
been held up for two years

00:47.505 --> 00:49.632
while he tries to build
an insanity defense.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.634
That's two years
on Rikers Island,

00:51.718 --> 00:54.679
and he just watched
his old boss walk free.

00:54.763 --> 00:58.308
So now he's admitting
to faking insanity?

00:58.391 --> 01:01.102
He's shifting his tactics.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.270
What did he say to you, exactly?

01:02.353 --> 01:06.316
That he can link Costa to
a couple murders from years ago.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.193
Even knows where the
bodies are buried.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.112
And you believe him?

01:12.113 --> 01:14.115
My evaluation stands.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.201
He's a sociopath.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.995
Lying is like breathing to him.

01:19.078 --> 01:22.081
But it's your call if you want
to hear what he has to say.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.174
POLLY: Thief.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.174
DERICK: Mrs. Riley,
please calm down.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.675
POLLY:
You're a thief. Where is it?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.135
Where is my necklace?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.179
Ma'am, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.139
Everything okay?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.139
No,

01:38.223 --> 01:39.349
everything's not okay.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.018
This plumber came into my
apartment and stole my necklace.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.145
No, my name's Derick.
I'm the building super.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.481
Whatever. Wait till
my husband gets home.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.690
I'm sorry to bother
you, Officer Janko.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.025
I'll clear this up.

01:49.108 --> 01:50.318
You're an officer?

01:50.401 --> 01:51.653
Good. Arrest that man.

01:51.736 --> 01:54.364
Is it possible
you just misplaced it?

01:54.447 --> 01:57.200
No. It was stolen
right out of my safe.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.993
Someone broke into your safe?

01:57.283 --> 01:58.993
Yes.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.328
I found it wide open.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.705
Could you have given
the combination to anyone?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.707
No.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.293
But someone must have...

02:09.796 --> 02:11.422
I think you're
a little confused, ma'am.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
You know what? I'm sure
you just misplaced it,

02:13.258 --> 02:14.342
like Officer
Janko said.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.386
Do you want us to
help you look?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.389
No.

02:20.765 --> 02:21.975
(door slams)

02:23.434 --> 02:25.228
Just out of curiosity,

02:25.311 --> 02:28.231
how many people you think your
client's killed in his lifetime?

02:28.314 --> 02:31.359
Mr. Wilks has, of course,
never killed anyone, Detectives.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.485
Except for Elliott Greene.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.028
Including Elliott Greene.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.363
Mm-hmm.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.363
BAEZ: We have your
client on camera,

02:35.446 --> 02:38.408
with Greene,
moments before he died.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.910
An unhappy coincidence.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.580
An unhappy coincidence that
Greene had his skull bashed in?

02:43.663 --> 02:44.998
He was a junkie.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.583
When I saw him,
he was half dead already.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.962
Right. So it was drugs did this
to Elliot Greene, huh?

02:51.045 --> 02:54.173
He was high, took a bad fall.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.551
ALEX:
Again,

02:56.634 --> 02:58.469
nothing to do with my client.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.972
Exactly how is it that
you even sleep at night?

03:01.055 --> 03:03.808
Just fine. I represent an honest
citizen who's been unjustly...

03:03.892 --> 03:05.727
You represent
a dishonest scumbag

03:05.810 --> 03:07.770
who has blood on his hands.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.941
Okay, we'll see who's smiling
when the M.E. comes back

03:12.025 --> 03:15.236
and rules this a homicide
and your client gets put away.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.071
For life.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.326
Now that'll be a bad fall.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.620
(door closes)

03:23.703 --> 03:25.622
(siren wailing)

03:25.705 --> 03:29.334
(indistinct chatter)

03:29.417 --> 03:30.919
JEFF:
All right,
you guys know the deal.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.253
Get your hands
out of your pockets.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.963
But we didn't do anything.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.963
Get your hands
out of your pockets!

03:34.047 --> 03:36.007
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, guys.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.300
Get up against the fence.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.300
This is harassment.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.302
Are you seeing this?
Are you recording this?

03:39.385 --> 03:41.262
Man, look at this.
It's an illegal search.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.597
Hey! I'm not gonna
do nothing, man...

03:42.680 --> 03:45.767
(overlapping shouting)

03:49.354 --> 03:52.231
Hey, get off! Aah!

03:49.354 --> 03:52.231
Are you seeing this?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.651
Hey!

03:52.315 --> 03:54.651
I'm not gonna do nothing, man.
Get off!

03:54.734 --> 03:57.320
This is ridiculous!

03:54.734 --> 03:57.320
Turn that thing off.
Turn that off. Turn it off!

03:57.403 --> 03:59.739
Put it away!
Put your phone down.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.200
And you suspended him
for this?

04:02.283 --> 04:03.326
I did.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.787
For doing his job.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.787
Oh, here we go.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.498
The men already don't
like it one bit.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.626
When they see this, you're gonna
have a mutiny on your hands.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.503
Which is why I asked you
up here, Johnny,

04:13.586 --> 04:14.963
to help me settle it.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.464
The men won't just lie down.

04:16.547 --> 04:17.423
I don't expect them to.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.718
What I do expect
is discipline in the ranks.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.720
Our ranks. Yours and mine.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.056
Jeff's a good cop
who the media's now gone after

04:25.139 --> 04:26.683
with no context.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.686
And your suspension gives them
the stamp of approval.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.480
The suspension is
according to procedure.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.482
Or it's you covering
your own ass.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.069
That's what the rank and file
are saying.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.696
You're quoting them exactly,
are you?

04:39.779 --> 04:42.532
Look, the media calls you out
personally.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.410
This was part of a larger
pattern of your tactics

04:45.493 --> 04:46.619
under the new mayor,

04:46.703 --> 04:49.872
a reversion to the so-called
dark days of stop-and-frisk.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.749
I care about my cops,
not the media.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.503
But by suspending this officer,
you just dump it on him.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.963
That's what's out there.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.591
I'm just warning you.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.427
Warn or threaten?

05:02.510 --> 05:03.886
The suspended officer's

05:03.970 --> 05:05.722
a union delegate
who carries weight

05:05.805 --> 05:08.933
among the cops in his own right.

05:09.017 --> 05:13.354
I got it on good authority he's
organizing a bout of blue flu

05:13.438 --> 05:15.565
in response to his suspension.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.942
So, threaten it is.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.279
It's not coming from me, Frank.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.031
(chuckles):
No, just your union.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.574
You're not seeing it.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.036
There's a cancer
in this department.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.043
There's a cancer
in my department?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.421
What's the offer?

05:38.504 --> 05:39.505
Reinstate him.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.424
In exchange for?

05:41.507 --> 05:42.800
The respect
of the rank and file.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.261
I have the deepest respect
for the rank and file.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.721
Are you doubting that?

05:48.306 --> 05:50.516
You need to hear him out.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.606
I thought his head was gonna
burst into flames there

05:56.689 --> 05:57.607
for a second.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.485
You suppose it might have
something to do

06:00.568 --> 06:03.696
with me suspending his son?

06:09.368 --> 06:12.497
♪ ♪

06:30.556 --> 06:32.100
Is that the Greene autopsy?

06:32.183 --> 06:33.309
Nope.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.310
Then what?

06:34.393 --> 06:36.020
A sick joke.

06:36.104 --> 06:40.483
Accidental death caused
by acute intoxication

06:40.566 --> 06:44.529
due to the combined effects of
heroin, fentanyl and cocaine.

06:44.612 --> 06:47.156
Okay, but you don't get
a caved-in skull like that

06:47.240 --> 06:48.574
from an overdose.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.828
The stairs he fell down,
just like Jackson claimed.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.329
Who the hell did the autopsy?

06:53.412 --> 06:54.163
Carson.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.082
Megan Carson?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.291
I know. If it
had been Reed

06:57.375 --> 06:58.793
or Keller, different story...

06:58.876 --> 07:00.336
Carson doesn't make mistakes.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.587
Not usually.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.464
Jackson's gonna walk
with this report.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.757
I know.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.016
(clears throat)
Megan?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.352
Detectives.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.352
Yeah.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.312
We don't mean any disrespect,
but we're wondering

07:18.396 --> 07:19.856
if it's possible
that you might have

07:19.939 --> 07:23.568
made a mistake with the, uh,
Elliott Greene manner of death.

07:23.651 --> 07:24.569
Absolutely not.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.864
He had a lethal cocktail
of drugs in his system.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.365
And then he fell
down some stairs?

07:29.448 --> 07:32.034
That was the source
of the cranial trauma.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.369
Sounds convenient.

07:33.452 --> 07:34.745
Not for him. He's dead.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.498
We mean, convenient for the guy
that killed him.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.375
Uh, Jackson Wilks.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.877
I don't know about all that.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.044
BAEZ: Well, let us
tell you.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.839
He's a hit man
who is out on the streets.

07:44.922 --> 07:48.384
I'm sorry. Are you accusing me
of something?

07:48.467 --> 07:51.262
No, we just want to make sure
we have the whole story. That...

07:51.345 --> 07:52.555
CARSON:
You do,

07:52.638 --> 07:54.390
right there in that file.

07:54.473 --> 07:58.686
I'm sorry that I can't help,
but this wasn't a homicide.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.563
You're not even gonna review it?

08:00.646 --> 08:02.356
I am a little busy,
as you can see.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.525
Yeah, so are we, trying to keep
Wilks off the street

08:04.609 --> 08:05.902
before someone else is killed.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.528
DANNY: Okay, let's all
just take it easy.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.197
We're all on the same team here.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.073
Are we?

08:11.157 --> 08:15.411
Yes. And, uh,
the M.E. has spoken, so...

08:23.419 --> 08:26.380
Donnie Hassett,
this is Detective Abetemarco.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.926
I'm A.D.A. Erin Reagan,
if you remember.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.260
How could I possibly forget?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.429
It's funny.
Last time we met,

08:33.512 --> 08:35.973
you could barely string
a sentence together.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.433
That was a very
stressful period.

08:37.516 --> 08:42.313
Right. And you are no longer
pleading insanity.

08:42.396 --> 08:45.399
Uh, Mr. Hassett would like
to make a deal instead.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.400
He knows where Costa

08:46.484 --> 08:48.569
has at least one body buried.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.281
And you can directly
connect it to Costa?

08:52.365 --> 08:53.407
That's right.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.784
In exchange for?

08:54.867 --> 08:56.452
Engineering my release.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.412
I already served two years
for a simple assault.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.789
That put a guy in a simple coma.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.249
And why should we trust you?

09:01.332 --> 09:04.168
You've already lied to us once,
about being insane.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.421
I'm gonna be completely honest
with you

09:07.505 --> 09:08.464
going forward, A.D.A. Reagan.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.133
Oh, well, if you say so.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.133
(laughs)

09:11.217 --> 09:14.512
I know how your doctor
labelled me. A sociopath.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.265
Do you know what that is?
By definition?

09:17.348 --> 09:19.934
A dangerous nutjob,
by definition.

09:20.017 --> 09:24.814
Very good at lying, very bad
at empathy, no conscience.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.525
Which describes a lot of
criminals. That's true.

09:27.608 --> 09:31.320
But also a lot of highly
functional people in Washington,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.656
Wall Street, Hollywood.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.865
ABETEMARCO:
You're in Rikers.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.492
That puts you
in the first group.

09:36.575 --> 09:39.245
Your preconceptions are--
No, no, no. Mike.

09:36.575 --> 09:39.245
No...

09:39.328 --> 09:40.871
HASSETT: Your preconceptions
are exactly

09:40.955 --> 09:43.749
why I'm gonna offer you a piece
of evidence on the house.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.334
This should be good.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.669
Mm-hmm.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.669
I'll give you
the location

09:46.752 --> 09:50.840
of a gun he used
in an execution 15 years ago.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.134
And then maybe we can
have a serious talk.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.304
Erin, he's sending us
on a goose chase here.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.765
I'm telling the truth,
whether you believe me or not.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.312
I had extra!

10:02.226 --> 10:04.312
NEWSMAN:
36 hours of steady rainfall

10:04.395 --> 10:06.147
have left many homes
in the metro area

10:06.230 --> 10:07.189
knee-deep in floodwaters...

10:07.273 --> 10:09.317
Thought maybe
you might want some?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.861
Snickerdoodles, you said?

10:11.944 --> 10:13.654
Put them there on the table.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.531
NEWSMAN:
No injuries were reported.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.158
Damage to homes and property

10:17.241 --> 10:18.576
is pegged at $3 million.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.662
Cleanup is expected to take
at least two days.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.373
That's a lovely family
you have here.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.626
(newsman continues)

10:24.457 --> 10:27.626
Is that your-your husband?

10:27.710 --> 10:28.711
Yes.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.421
Does he live here?

10:30.504 --> 10:32.006
Damn thing never works.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.299
(TV turns off)

10:35.634 --> 10:37.762
Did you ever find the
necklace you were missing?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.764
That's not all I'm missing.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.223
More jewelry,

10:41.307 --> 10:42.558
china,

10:42.641 --> 10:43.934
my father's old watch.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.728
That plumber stole it all.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.396
May I look at the safe?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.231
It's in the closet.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.566
Over there.

10:50.649 --> 10:51.942
Oh.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.200
Yeah, it's empty.

10:59.283 --> 11:03.621
Of course it is.
It was all stolen.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.247
Where's the remote?

11:05.331 --> 11:08.709
Where is it?
(sighs)

11:08.793 --> 11:10.086
I appreciate the opportunity

11:10.169 --> 11:11.796
to give my side
to your investigation.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.298
And we appreciate
your cooperation.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.428
Officer Lyons.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.555
JEFF:
Commissioner Reagan.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.734
So, where are we at?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.654
Where we're at is
our investigation corroborated

11:36.737 --> 11:39.281
exactly what we saw in the video

11:39.365 --> 11:41.075
and heard
in the eyewitness testimony.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.702
Namely, that your
actions were not in line

11:43.786 --> 11:48.833
with the mission, vision
or values of this department.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.085
Surprise, surprise.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.510
You are accountable
for your actions, Officer Lyons.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.680
When no one else
is accountable for theirs?

12:03.722 --> 12:05.808
Just who isn't?

12:06.642 --> 12:09.770
I was following orders
from my C.O.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.772
Your C.O. ordered you
to tune the guy up?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.315
Not in so many words.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.483
In what words, then?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.193
"Put the fear of God in 'em."

12:16.277 --> 12:17.820
See,

12:17.903 --> 12:20.698
he got his ass fried
at CompStat last week.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.658
So like C.O.s do,

12:22.741 --> 12:23.993
he came home to the house
and kicked the dog,

12:24.076 --> 12:25.828
and us beat cops, we're the dog.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.540
Did you fry his ass
at CompStat last week?

12:29.623 --> 12:33.002
There's a sharp rise
in street-level drug trafficking

12:33.085 --> 12:34.170
in the precinct.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.298
So grilled maybe, but not fried.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.508
Whatever it was,
my C.O. came back hot.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.887
And told his cops
to chuck the Patrol Guide?

12:42.970 --> 12:44.680
Well...

12:44.763 --> 12:46.849
(chuckles) No. It d--
It don't work that way.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.560
Well, please,
in what way does it work?

12:49.643 --> 12:52.521
I don't work at the Puzzle
Palace, so I don't know...

12:52.605 --> 12:55.691
Ah. The Puzzle Palace.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.361
One PP was nicknamed that
long before I was here.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.490
So I don't know what gold
tells brass.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.492
What I do know
is the guys in blue

13:04.575 --> 13:07.995
don't have the white shirt
immunity that you all do.

13:08.078 --> 13:11.499
You talk the talk,
but we got to walk the walk.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.462
You need to be careful,
Officer Lyons.

13:17.838 --> 13:21.091
And you need to know this:
the truth.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.846
The truth according
to one pissed-off cop?

13:25.930 --> 13:29.058
Ask that when we show up on your
doorstep in force next week.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.061
Ask all the other cops who take
the beatings from the media

13:32.144 --> 13:33.771
and the crap from the citizens

13:33.854 --> 13:36.524
to keep One PP
smelling like roses.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.027
I would remind you
I was on the ground, too.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.738
And we answered to One PP, also.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.866
How long ago?
Was it even the same back then?

13:48.369 --> 13:52.414
No. It was different.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.047
Sir, my family is NYPD, too.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.758
It's in my blood, too.

14:02.841 --> 14:06.762
And to me, that means if I see
something wrong, I call it out.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.560
And you called it out
by manhandling a civilian

14:12.643 --> 14:15.479
on our streets.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.981
The suspension stands.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.444
Thanks.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.444
DANNY:
You're kidding me. Yep.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.696
All right.
Thank you so much.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.406
Yeah.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.406
What's going on?

14:25.489 --> 14:26.949
I'm gonna dump you
back at the squad

14:27.032 --> 14:28.993
and go pay Megan
another visit myself.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.578
Just you, huh?

14:30.661 --> 14:31.495
Yeah, I got a hunch
about something.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.247
Uh-huh.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.623
What does that mean?
"Uh-huh"?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.917
Oh, come on, Danny. You
two have been flirting

14:37.001 --> 14:38.460
for the better
part of a year now.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.670
What are you talking about?

14:39.753 --> 14:41.463
It doesn't take a detective.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.798
I'm serious. What?

14:42.881 --> 14:44.967
Well, why did you defend
her at the morgue, then?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.635
I didn't defend her
at the morgue.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.221
She should've reviewed that
autopsy no questions asked,

14:49.305 --> 14:50.306
You know that.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.641
I agree with you, 100%.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.476
You do?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.476
Yes, I do.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.686
I noticed how she was.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.814
I mean, she's usually cold like
the bodies she keeps company.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.816
This time she was nervous,
she was aloof.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.193
But I had to get
hard evidence first.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.653
So, who was on the phone?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.114
Her boss.
She wasn't even supposed to work

15:07.197 --> 15:08.490
the day the vic came in,

15:08.574 --> 15:10.326
but for some reason,
she showed up anyway,

15:10.409 --> 15:13.329
and specifically
requested that autopsy.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.664
You think maybe
Wilks got to her?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.333
That's what I'm gonna find out.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.628
Captain Sims, congratulations.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.297
Yours has been voted
the grungiest precinct

15:23.380 --> 15:25.799
in Manhattan North.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.677
Congratulations.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.179
Well done.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.848
You making any progress
on the graffiti problem?

15:32.931 --> 15:34.642
Yes, sir,
we've made real strides.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.644
Oh, good. That's good.
I'm glad to hear that.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.854
Now,

15:38.937 --> 15:42.191
would you say it's
been eradicated?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.276
Pretty much, sir.
We've made several arrests.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.278
Several arrests? Wow.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.573
So, there mustn't be
any graffiti left at all.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.532
Well, I wouldn't
say none, sir...

15:50.616 --> 15:52.576
You wouldn't say?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.576
But there's not much left.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.662
Not much left?
You know, that's wonderful.

15:54.745 --> 15:55.704
Turn around, Captain.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.874
Look at that.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.251
That look like
not much?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.711
That look like not much left
to you?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.172
Because to me,
it looks like

16:05.255 --> 16:07.883
your whole borough
is doused in paint.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.802
We're making progress.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.802
Not enough!

16:09.885 --> 16:11.762
And the next
time you're here,

16:11.845 --> 16:13.889
if it's not cleaned up, it's
gonna be your last time here.

16:13.972 --> 16:16.183
Dismissed. Go home.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.107
(murmuring)

16:26.777 --> 16:28.779
(sighs)

16:33.617 --> 16:35.411
You okay, Captain?

16:36.453 --> 16:38.163
As you were.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.163
Sorry, sir.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.583
Rough time in there?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.211
Oh, no, sir.
(sighs)

16:44.294 --> 16:46.213
Something I ate for breakfast.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.673
(laughs softly)

16:49.800 --> 16:51.301
Carry on.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.553
Thank you, sir.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.762
GARRETT:
<i>Boss, you were there.</i>

16:53.846 --> 16:54.888
We don't use kid gloves,

16:54.972 --> 16:57.808
but the reviews are all built
on support for our guys.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.935
I wasn't there
for Captain Sims' review.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.437
Was that supportive?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.439
Sims needed the screws turned.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.107
But yes, it was supportive.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.900
I walked on him
just out of there.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.570
He was chugging antacids
and white as a sheet.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.821
Well, maybe it was
something he ate.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.489
(chuckles):
Yeah, well...

17:12.573 --> 17:14.658
I know it's not the first time
someone's been beat up

17:14.742 --> 17:20.414
by CompStat, but this time,
something stuck with me.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.792
Garrett, you heard of
"white shirt immunity"?

17:23.876 --> 17:24.918
Only in passing.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.130
It's the gap between
white shirts and blue shirts.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.966
The gap between our officers
and their superiors.

17:31.049 --> 17:33.135
Higher-ups seem immune
to discipline.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.762
So you heard it.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.638
Well, I hear a lot of things,
but it doesn't mean

17:36.722 --> 17:38.140
I give them all
the same credence.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.642
Sims wears a white shirt.
I didn't show him any immunity.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.479
I'm talking about
real consequences, Sid,

17:43.562 --> 17:45.022
not just a dressing down.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.649
Well, boss, I can't go around
firing brass.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.651
No one is suggesting you should.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.696
So what's wrong with me holding
C.O.s like Sims accountable?

17:52.780 --> 17:55.324
Absolutely nothing, as long
as they don't take it out

17:55.407 --> 17:57.117
on the guys in their house.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.703
Now you sound
like Johnny Lyons' boy.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.499
Not really, but, you know...

18:02.289 --> 18:03.499
Look, I know the media

18:03.582 --> 18:08.420
went after him, but he made the
mistake, not his C.O., not Sid.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.632
And if he has a point?

18:11.715 --> 18:13.675
You're gonna put that on me?

18:14.718 --> 18:17.346
No. On me.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.850
Every year, there's a cadre
of disgruntled officers.

18:21.934 --> 18:22.976
And why?

18:23.060 --> 18:24.186
Boss, they're ungrateful.

18:24.269 --> 18:28.816
Or maybe I've been here too long
and I'm just out of touch.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.778
You've been at One PP
a long time,

18:32.861 --> 18:35.489
but you are not out of touch.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.741
Our jobs are different
than they were back in the day.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.830
But at some point,
did I stop being a cop

18:42.913 --> 18:46.917
and turn into a CEO of cops?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.753
You can't h...

18:49.837 --> 18:52.881
Uh, that's a tough one, boss.
I don't know.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.843
I don't think that's a question

18:55.926 --> 18:59.888
that either one of us can answer
to your satisfaction.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.561
I got to give it to you.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.437
We found the gun,
right where you said.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.522
Do you trust me now?

19:08.605 --> 19:12.526
No. You know all good
lies start with the truth.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.944
Your loss.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.488
Look, we'll play ball--
you have my word--

19:16.572 --> 19:18.824
but we're not guaranteeing
anything without a body.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.617
My word is good.
You can ask around.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.751
I'm coming with you.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.461
(chuckles)
That's a good one.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.255
I've been nothing but honest
with you two.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.757
I've given you a chip,
I deserve one in turn.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.093
I'm coming with you to the body
or it's no deal.

19:38.176 --> 19:40.512
Okay, then. No deal.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.307
Is he right?

19:43.390 --> 19:46.852
Probably. And smart, too.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.897
But...?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.108
But I really want Costa.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.443
Erin...

19:53.192 --> 19:54.443
And probably
for the first time

19:54.526 --> 19:56.904
in your life,
you're the lesser of two evils.

19:56.987 --> 19:57.946
Gee, thanks.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.156
Counsel all right with this?

19:59.239 --> 20:00.782
Yes.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.117
Erin, there's no way
we're trusting this guy.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.452
You got a gun, don't you?

20:03.535 --> 20:04.494
Come on, you can't be serious...

20:04.578 --> 20:07.998
So do I, and he does not.
So I think we're good.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.634
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

20:19.676 --> 20:21.386
Eddie?

20:21.470 --> 20:22.930
Hey, Eddie, wake up. Wake up.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.930
(grunts softly)

20:23.013 --> 20:24.097
Hey.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.097
What?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.307
You're late for your double.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.809
What? Oh, crap.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.145
What are you doing,
sleeping on the couch?

20:30.228 --> 20:31.855
I must've dozed off.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.024
Did you make cookies?

20:34.107 --> 20:37.611
Yeah. I, uh, brought them
to Mrs. Riley.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.656
She seemed like she needed
her spirits lifted.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.573
I thought we talked about

20:41.657 --> 20:43.533
you not burning the candle
at both ends.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.079
(sighs)
I couldn't help it.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.499
Yeah, I get it. I, uh,

20:50.582 --> 20:51.625
I asked Espinoza about her,

20:51.708 --> 20:52.668
because his mom
used to live here,

20:52.751 --> 20:54.836
and he says that ever since
she got divorced,

20:54.920 --> 20:56.004
she's had one of these outbursts

20:56.088 --> 20:57.631
once a year.

20:57.714 --> 20:58.840
She's divorced?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.968
Yeah. Is that really surprising?

21:01.051 --> 21:05.305
She made it seem like
her husband's still around.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.474
Not for the past
seven years, apparently.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.018
That's strange.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.853
Sounds to me like
maybe she's got dementia.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.856
Maybe someone is
taking advantage of it.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.192
Or she misplaced her things
all by herself.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.027
We should figure out which.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.197
Ah!

21:20.278 --> 21:22.197
Go.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.198
I love you.

21:23.281 --> 21:24.908
Bye. Love you.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.038
Just you?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.498
Mm-hmm.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.041
I went to your office first.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.835
They said you didn't
come in today.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.878
Where's your partner?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.214
She had to stay behind,

21:39.298 --> 21:41.383
do some paperwork
with the squad.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.342
Oh.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.302
Besides, if she came along,
it would make it

21:44.386 --> 21:46.888
official police business.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.390
And it's not?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.766
Not exactly.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.393
I was hoping that you
and I could have a talk.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.602
Just us.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.065
You know, Megan,
it seems like

21:57.149 --> 21:59.276
you might be mixed up in
something that you shouldn't be.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.610
Like what?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.488
You tell me.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.908
It's obvious that
you're scared.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.453
I'm not.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.453
Really?

22:09.536 --> 22:12.205
Then how come you won't
even look me in the eye?

22:20.297 --> 22:22.924
Did Jackson Wilks
get to you?

22:23.008 --> 22:26.261
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:26.344 --> 22:27.971
Yes, you do. Hey.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.765
This guy's a professional
killer.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.641
It's what he does.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.935
And he does not leave
loose ends, and right now

22:34.019 --> 22:35.437
that is exactly what you are.

22:38.148 --> 22:42.235
I can protect you, Megan, but
you gotta come clean with me.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.073
Did he get to you or not?

22:58.877 --> 23:00.003
(door closes)

23:00.087 --> 23:02.130
(clears throat)

23:02.214 --> 23:05.801
(sighs)
So, uh, what's this all about?

23:05.884 --> 23:06.968
Yeah, is everything okay?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.637
Why does it have to be
about something?

23:08.720 --> 23:09.846
Can't we just have
a guys' night?

23:09.930 --> 23:14.142
Well, we can, it's just "guys'
night" for us usually means

23:14.226 --> 23:14.976
there's something
to talk about, kinda like

23:15.060 --> 23:17.104
when I show up on Thursday
with a roast.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.980
Ulterior motives.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.983
I got 36,000 men and women
who work for me,

23:22.067 --> 23:25.779
so 36,000 who are hardwired
to tell me

23:25.862 --> 23:28.615
exactly what they think
I want to hear.

23:28.698 --> 23:32.160
Except the ones coming down
with the blue flu.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.955
Yeah.

23:35.038 --> 23:35.872
No one from my squad's
participating,

23:35.956 --> 23:37.999
but it sounds like
the union's got numbers.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.668
And I hear they're growing.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.628
Yeah. So here's the deal.

23:41.711 --> 23:46.133
Am I seen as deaf, dumb
and blind, or all three?

23:46.216 --> 23:47.759
Well...

23:49.469 --> 23:51.847
It's not you personally, Dad.

23:51.930 --> 23:55.142
Well, Jamie, the buck
does stop here.

23:55.225 --> 23:58.019
It's not all 36,000
that have a problem.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.355
Okay, thank you.
But the ones who do.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.024
(sighs)

24:03.108 --> 24:07.487
Some cops feel like orders
come down from on high

24:07.571 --> 24:09.865
that don't factor in how
they play on the street.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.199
DANNY:
And they contradict

24:11.283 --> 24:13.743
other orders that come
down from One PP.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.371
JAMIE:
There's a sense that
some orders boil down to

24:16.454 --> 24:19.166
"get this done now," not
"get this done, here's how."

24:19.249 --> 24:20.750
Right.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.750
HENRY: Things get lost
in translation.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.169
They always did.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.337
And even with all
the modern technology,

24:24.421 --> 24:27.174
it's still humans that
pass the word along.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.884
DANNY:
Bottom line,

24:28.967 --> 24:30.051
there's a feeling that

24:30.135 --> 24:32.679
One PP wants us
to do the dirty jobs

24:32.762 --> 24:34.890
while keeping our hands
clean at the same time,

24:34.973 --> 24:37.100
which is basically impossible.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.060
And we never had any
of the political interference

24:39.144 --> 24:41.062
that you do.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.232
City Hall didn't care how
the sausages got made.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.234
So what's one thing
I'm doing wrong?

24:46.318 --> 24:50.197
Well, I mean, if we
had to pick just one...

24:50.280 --> 24:52.199
That is a hard choice.
That's a hard choice.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.576
(laughter)

24:54.659 --> 24:57.287
Just start with one.

24:58.455 --> 25:02.125
Thinking you can be clearly
understood by one and all.

25:02.209 --> 25:06.463
Worrying what the rank and file
really think about you.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.758
They don't know the person,
they-they just know the boss.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.135
Not using the rumblings in
the ranks to your advantage.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.678
How so?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.722
Think of it as the divide
between the players

25:15.805 --> 25:17.140
and the coaching staff.

25:17.224 --> 25:20.060
Sometimes hating the coaches
brings the team together

25:20.143 --> 25:21.269
in ways you couldn't foresee.

25:21.353 --> 25:25.774
Yeah. Maybe.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.276
Or you play the divide,
trust rides the bench,

25:28.360 --> 25:31.196
and the team falls
even farther behind.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.586
Hi, Mrs. Riley.
I-I made you some cookies.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.713
Can I come in?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.425
I just had some extra,
thought you might like some.

25:52.509 --> 25:56.680
Oatmeal raisin barely
count as cookies.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.181
Put 'em over there.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.814
I heard you might be missing
some belongings.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.315
Yes.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.150
This morning, my sapphire ring
went missing

26:09.234 --> 26:10.318
right from off my finger.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.612
Uh-huh.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.823
Well, when was the--
the last time that you had it?

26:14.906 --> 26:16.658
Before my husband came over.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.286
I don't mean to be rude,
but aren't you divorced?

26:19.369 --> 26:21.621
Divorced? What are you
talking about?

26:21.705 --> 26:23.456
Where's your wedding ring?

26:25.625 --> 26:28.295
That plumber stole
my wedding ring.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.175
Do you have anyone,
any family that looks after you?

26:34.259 --> 26:36.303
I told you, my husband.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.346
You don't have a husband,
Mrs. Riley.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.557
You haven't had one
for seven years.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.352
Oh, really?

26:52.444 --> 26:55.280
Then who does all this
belong to?

27:02.662 --> 27:05.540
Five cases.
Three assaults, two homicides.

27:05.623 --> 27:07.876
Wilks has walked on all of them.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.211
She is good, I'll give her that.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.881
It's easy, when the truth
is on your side.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.215
Except you don't have
the truth on your side.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.342
This is the truth.

27:15.425 --> 27:18.178
Greene's real autopsy.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.554
Ruled a homicide.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.765
The M.E. changed
the manner of death?

27:21.848 --> 27:23.058
Mm-hmm.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.559
Because you threatened
her personally.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.061
Is that what she said?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.771
We're asking the questions here.

27:27.854 --> 27:31.024
Now, it's obvious this
took a lot of planning.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.735
And it's even more obvious
that Jackson Wilks isn't

27:33.818 --> 27:35.737
both the brains
and the muscle here.

27:35.820 --> 27:39.074
I'm sorry, where was
the question?

27:39.157 --> 27:40.700
You're not just his lawyer,
are you?

27:40.784 --> 27:44.079
You help him with this little
boutique murder operation.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.415
That pretty M.E.
talked to you, huh?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.417
That's too bad.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.669
Is that another threat?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.669
Of course not.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.089
'Cause you're not
gonna touch her.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.089
You're right.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.757
I'm not.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.300
You know if anything
happens to her,

27:57.384 --> 28:00.887
you may just have
an accident yourself.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.430
Danny.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.598
So we're playing
the same game.

28:03.681 --> 28:05.975
I'm not playing any game.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.270
Do yourself a favor.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.439
Tell us where we can
find Jackson Wilks.

28:14.651 --> 28:18.446
I think I'll make
my phone call instead.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.451
Suit yourself.

28:23.535 --> 28:28.289
So a piece of string
walks into a bar

28:28.373 --> 28:30.959
and says to the bartender,
"Give me a beer."

28:31.042 --> 28:32.544
The bartender says,
"We don't serve pieces of..."

28:32.627 --> 28:35.964
Hey, John Riley.

28:36.047 --> 28:39.634
Uh-oh, five-o.
(chuckles)

28:39.717 --> 28:42.011
Only kidding, Officer.
That'd be me.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.388
What can I do you for?

28:43.471 --> 28:46.141
You celebrating something?

28:43.471 --> 28:46.141
Yep.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.560
Being old.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.562
Doesn't give you the right
to break the law.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.485
What law is that, Officer?

28:57.569 --> 28:58.903
Grand larceny.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.783
If this is coming
from Polly,

29:03.867 --> 29:05.493
she's out of her mind.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.620
I tracked down a couple
of her missing items

29:07.704 --> 29:09.497
to some local pawn shops,

29:09.581 --> 29:11.624
where you sold 'em.

29:11.708 --> 29:15.170
You don't know what it was like
being with her.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.464
She took years off my life.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.300
It doesn't give you the right
to steal from her.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.969
And were you having her
do your laundry?

29:20.383 --> 29:22.969
Look, it's not like

29:23.052 --> 29:24.888
I hurt anyone.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.348
She doesn't even know
what's going on.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.683
That makes it even worse.

29:28.766 --> 29:31.352
Have you met her?

29:28.766 --> 29:31.352
Yes, I have.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.481
Then you already know what
a terrible person she is.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.858
That's what a life

29:36.941 --> 29:41.321
of being a monster gets you.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.031
You die alone.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.991
No one deserves that.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.910
You gonna arrest me?

29:46.993 --> 29:48.495
No.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.163
You're gonna help me track down

29:50.246 --> 29:52.540
every last one of Polly's
belongings that you sold.

on day tours.

Espinoza about a little bit more

didn't you?

I might have mentioned
that the nights

35:06.229 --> 35:07.688
were getting
to you, but...

35:06.229 --> 35:07.688
Mm.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.398
I can fight
my own battles.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.358

35:10.441 --> 35:13.528
But thank you for fighting
this one for me,

35:13.611 --> 35:16.697

it, chasing after her ghosts.

35:16.781 --> 35:20.076
Actually,
it-it wasn't ghosts.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.536

Y-- He was
taking advantage

stealing from her.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.958
You were right all along.

You're kidding.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.543
Nope.

earlier today.

I know Mrs. Riley is not the

but I feel bad for her.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.887

35:39.971 --> 35:42.765
You want to join us?
We need some new blood,

35:56.988 --> 36:00.575
The body has been identified
as a rival of Costa's.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.243
So we still have
a lot of work to do,

he shouldn't be released

36:11.210 --> 36:13.421
under any circumstances.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.589
And what do<i> you</i> say?

36:14.672 --> 36:17.425
You kept your word.
I'll keep mine.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.385
So I'm to be released?

36:19.468 --> 36:21.596
I'll let the judge know
I'm offering misdemeanor

36:21.679 --> 36:23.055

36:23.139 --> 36:26.601
Thank you, Erin. Is it

36:26.684 --> 36:29.478

36:33.399 --> 36:34.734

your every move,

36:34.817 --> 36:36.068

36:51.709 --> 36:53.628

36:53.711 --> 36:56.172

37:13.940 --> 37:16.609

37:29.747 --> 37:32.500
Hey, Bob.

Commissioner.

37:32.583 --> 37:37.755
Relax, Officer Tyson,
I ain't handing out rips today.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.635
Okay.

37:42.718 --> 37:44.845
This whole thing is tainted

37:44.929 --> 37:46.806
by what you think you stand

37:46.889 --> 37:50.685
to gain personally, having
your suspension overturned.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.855
Well, I got to tell you.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.565
That ain't gonna happen.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.526
That's not
what this is.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.362
That said, I
think you have

38:01.445 --> 38:04.031
some legitimate points,

38:04.115 --> 38:09.704
and I have some
legitimate concerns, so...

38:09.787 --> 38:13.749
So? You're here to do what?

38:13.833 --> 38:16.544
You can't change the system.
You<i> are</i> the system.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.045
Change can't come
from within?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.880
From within
the Puzzle Palace?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.257
I don't see how.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.883
(murmuring)

38:22.967 --> 38:25.720
I don't think I share
that pessimism.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.722
So you're gonna start holding
the white shirts accountable?

38:27.805 --> 38:32.727
If an officer like yourself
faces discipline

38:32.810 --> 38:36.188
for carrying out a direct order
from their superior,

38:36.272 --> 38:39.233
the superior shares
accountability.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.736
The pressure
will still be there.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.780
Their orders will become
"suggestions" we can't refuse.

38:44.864 --> 38:48.701
And follow-up
on CompStat sessions

38:48.784 --> 38:52.538
will be enhanced to ensure
accountability for blue shirts

38:52.621 --> 38:55.041
<i>and</i> white shirt.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.083
(murmuring)

38:58.169 --> 39:00.588
Me?

39:00.671 --> 39:01.881
Where's your accountability?

39:01.964 --> 39:05.551
(chuckling): Well...
pretty much the only guy

39:05.634 --> 39:09.597
who can hold me to
the fire is the mayor.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.849
But why I'm here?

39:12.516 --> 39:15.811
To give you all
that opportunity.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.566
We can't stand divided.

39:20.649 --> 39:23.611
So have at it.
Give me your worst.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.446
Throw your eggs
and rotten tomatoes,

39:25.529 --> 39:29.617

39:35.498 --> 39:37.625
But if you don't want
to hear it, I won't say it.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.584
Of course he does.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.295
Maybe he's had enough
gripes for the week.

39:41.378 --> 39:43.798
Oh, that's okay. Bring it on.

39:41.378 --> 39:43.798
DANNY: All right.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.467
Well, currently,
if a detective wants to work

39:46.550 --> 39:49.261
one of his vacation weeks
for double overtime,

39:49.345 --> 39:50.805
they have to do it in uniform,

39:50.888 --> 39:52.848
doing a security detail
outside One PP.

39:52.932 --> 39:53.849
That's not fair.

39:53.933 --> 39:57.603
I thought we were talking about
beat cop beefs,

39:57.686 --> 39:59.146
not detective beefs.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.481
We are, but I'm just saying

40:00.564 --> 40:02.525
detectives want to do
real detective work,

40:02.608 --> 40:03.651
in the squad room.

40:03.734 --> 40:04.860
You know?

40:03.734 --> 40:04.860
Noted.

40:04.944 --> 40:05.945
Thank you.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.489
I have a beat cop beef.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.866
Maybe we should
change the subject.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.202
Ah. Come on, I can take it.

40:13.285 --> 40:15.663
Okay. Couple times a year,
we have to qualify

40:15.746 --> 40:17.623
at the firing range
at Rodman's Neck.

40:17.706 --> 40:18.958
Oh, the lines.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.668
Hours, sometimes.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.503
It's like trying to find parking
at Jones Beach

40:22.586 --> 40:24.588
on Fourth of July.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.588
JANKO: Except without
the reward

40:24.672 --> 40:25.714
of beach time.

40:25.798 --> 40:26.841
Maybe some kind of
online sign-up

40:26.924 --> 40:28.259
where you could reserve a spot.

40:29.635 --> 40:32.513
I'll look into it.
Thank you.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.849
Did you hear any beefs
that surprised you?

40:34.932 --> 40:37.184
Well, not actually a beef,

40:37.268 --> 40:39.687
more like a request
to bring back something

40:39.770 --> 40:42.982
from way back when.
Blood Days.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.192
(chuckling): What?

40:43.065 --> 40:45.192
Yeah.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.902
Those sound either
incredibly cool

40:46.986 --> 40:49.530
or incredibly brutal.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.530
It's neither.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.700
What are Blood Days, and
should I alert the ACLU?

40:52.783 --> 40:54.410
HENRY:
If an officer
gave blood,

40:54.493 --> 40:57.872
he got the rest of that day
and the next two days off

40:57.955 --> 40:59.081
at full pay.

40:59.165 --> 41:00.082
Whoa.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.417
So what'd you say?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.127
Well, that I'd look into it

41:03.210 --> 41:04.879
if they agreed to be in uniform

41:04.962 --> 41:09.091
when they donated,
so that the community could see

41:09.175 --> 41:12.261
all the good we do.
Two birds, one stone.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.263
Nice.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.263
Yeah.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.933
Which brings us to you, Sean.

41:18.017 --> 41:22.062
A lot of the cops I met with
come from cop families.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.316
Jeff Lyons' family
goes back generations,

41:25.399 --> 41:28.027
like ours. So...

41:28.110 --> 41:31.238
Does ours end with me?

41:31.322 --> 41:34.241
Yeah. 'Cause sadly,
it's kind of obvious

41:34.325 --> 41:37.077
that Jack is not heading
in that direction, so...

41:37.161 --> 41:39.205
And Nicky clearly is not.

41:41.832 --> 41:42.917
Well, Sean?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.961
Can you take Blood Days
every week?

41:46.045 --> 41:47.755
Nope. Twice a year.

41:47.838 --> 41:51.050
Hmm. Sort that out
and we'll talk about it.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.637
(all chuckling)
