YOU GOT A BUCK KNIFE.
I GOT A NECKLACE.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.200
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE
DAD DOESN'T LIKE YOU

04:40.200 --> 04:42.300
AND WANTS YOU
TO LEAVE.

04:42.300 --> 04:46.100
BUT THIS IS MY "BECOMING
A MAN" GIFT FROM DAD.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.200
I FEEL VERY BAD FOR ME.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.500

BECAUSE, TO DAD,

04:50.500 --> 04:52.500
SOMEHOW THESE LITTLE
TRINKETS ARE IMPORTANT.

TO ACT GRATEFUL?

TO WEAR THIS SUCKER.

A RELATIVELY YOUNG MAN.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.100
WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

05:02.100 --> 05:03.500
I'D SAY YOUR ONLY WAY
OUT OF THIS ONE

05:03.500 --> 05:07.100
IS TO GET MARRIED, HAVE KIDS,
AND PASS IT ON.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.367
I'M JUST GOING TO PRETEND
I NEVER FOUND IT.

05:10.367 --> 05:13.100
IT WAS ON YOUR FACE.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.300
I'M SORRY, HONEY,

05:15.300 --> 05:16.967
BUT TODAY OUR SON'S
GOING TO LOVE ME

05:16.967 --> 05:20.300
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN HE LOVES YOU.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.233

I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

HIS FATHER'S SILVER GLOVES.

05:28.767 --> 05:30.934
HOW MANY PUNCHES
YOU TOOK TO THIS FACE,

YOU DON'T
LOOK TOO SHABBY.

DID YOU SIGN MY--
YES, YOUR PERMISSION SLIP.

TO EVERYTHING

TELLS YOU, RIGHT?

05:38.967 --> 05:40.367
YEAH, YEAH.

05:40.367 --> 05:41.500
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GOOF AROUND WITH SHAWN?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.000
NO, NO.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.300
HOW LONG AFTER EATING
BEFORE GOING IN THAT WATER?

05:44.300 --> 05:47.000
MOM! WHATEVER ANSWER
GETS ME IN THE POOL.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.834
- 30 MINUTES.
- HALF AN HOUR.

YEAH, UH, THANKS FOR
THE LITTLE SILVER MITTENS.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.600

MEAN A LOT TO ME.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.000
REALLY. BYE.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.033
WELL, THAT'S OK
IF HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.567
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
LIKE I GAVE IT TO HIM

06:10.567 --> 06:13.934
TO GET ONE OF
THOSE KODAK MOMENTS.

06:16.033 --> 06:18.800
I FEEL VERY BAD.

06:20.967 --> 06:23.033
ALAN, LOVE OF MY LIFE,

06:23.033 --> 06:24.767
DID YOU BY ANY CHANCE
EXPLAIN TO CORY

06:24.767 --> 06:26.300
THE MEANING OF
THOSE SILVER GLOVES?

06:26.300 --> 06:27.934
NOT YET.

06:27.934 --> 06:30.600
WELL, THEN HOW'S HE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THEY'RE IMPORTANT?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.100
I PUT THEM ON HIS FACE.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.100

06:35.100 --> 06:36.867
THAT YOU EVEN
WON THOSE GLOVES.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.600
HI.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.133
WHAT'S ON MY FACE?

06:43.133 --> 06:44.200
NOTHING.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.667
AND WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO ABOUT THAT?

06:47.667 --> 06:48.800

I'LL ACT SURPRISED.

NO LONGER A BABY?

AND DADDY'S BIG GIRL.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.834
THAT'S RIGHT, AND NOW
THAT YOU'RE A BIG GIRL,

07:03.834 --> 07:05.767
IT'S NOT HARD FOR
YOU TO UNDERSTAND

07:05.767 --> 07:07.200
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET A PRESENT

07:07.200 --> 07:09.567
EVERY TIME IT'S SOMEBODY
ELSE'S BIRTHDAY.

07:09.567 --> 07:12.000
BUT YOU ALWAYS USED
TO GIVE ME PRESENTS

07:12.000 --> 07:13.600
ON CORY AND
ERIC'S BIRTHDAYS.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.834
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE

07:14.834 --> 07:16.133
WE DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL BAD, SWEETIE.

07:16.133 --> 07:19.500
WELL, I FEEL BAD NOW.

07:22.767 --> 07:25.500
DON'T YOU CAVE IN
ON ME, MISTER.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.834
OH, COME ON.

I CAN STILL AFFORD IT.

I AM YOUR FATHER.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.934
WHAT'S THAT FOR,
SEEING OUT OF SUBMARINES?

07:48.934 --> 07:51.500
FOR BREATHING. DIDN'T YOU
EVER GO SNORKELING?

07:51.500 --> 07:53.100
NO, NEVER. DID YOU?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.967

07:54.967 --> 07:58.300

GROWING DOWN THERE.

07:58.300 --> 08:01.400

THIS UNDERWATER LIFE

08:01.400 --> 08:04.400
BECAUSE I AM...

MAN, CORY, YOU ARE
THE WHITEST WHITE BOY

08:13.600 --> 08:15.600

08:15.600 --> 08:17.000
OH, YEAH?
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.400

I'M THINKING.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.700

NOTHING TO HIDE.

RIDICULE THE HUMAN FORM.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.300

BUT HE'S DOING IT
BETTER THAN US.

THE NECKLACE?

09:57.967 --> 09:59.967

OVER THAT.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.800
HAVE YOU TAKEN LEAVE
OF YOUR SENSES?

10:20.800 --> 10:24.867
YOU CAN ENDANGER THE SAFETY
OF YOURSELF AND OTHERS.

10:24.867 --> 10:26.100
NO TOUCHING THE EQUIPMENT

10:26.100 --> 10:27.734

GETS HERE.

DIVE MASTER ANYWAY?

10:29.500 --> 10:30.600
I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS,

10:30.600 --> 10:32.133
AS LONG AS IT GETS US
OUT OF SCHOOL,

10:32.133 --> 10:34.300

NO, OF COURSE I KNOW
YOUR NAME IS DONNA.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.200
I MEAN, VICKY'S JUST A LITTLE
PET NAME I LIKE TO USE,

11:43.200 --> 11:46.834
YOU KNOW, LIKE HONEY,
DARLING, VICKY.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.967
YOU'RE GOING TO HANG UP
ON ME NOW, AREN'T YOU?

11:48.967 --> 11:51.100
YES, YOU ARE. OK.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.867
HEY, HOW COME
YOU'RE NOT WEARING

11:52.867 --> 11:55.500
THE LITTLE SILVER MITTENS
DAD GAVE YOU?

11:55.500 --> 11:56.800
WHAT?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.400
OH, I MUST HAVE
LEFT THEM AT THE POOL.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.467
NO BIG DEAL.

11:59.467 --> 12:00.734
I'LL BUY HIM
ANOTHER PAIR TOMORROW.

12:00.734 --> 12:03.700
ERIC, SCUBA IS SO COOL.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.700
LOOK. I STAYED UNDER
THE WATER FOR 20 MINUTES.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.133
YOUR FINGERS LOOK
LIKE GRANDMA'S NECK.

12:09.133 --> 12:10.500
HEY, GUYS.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.000
HEY, DAD.
HEY, DAD.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.300
CORY, IT OCCURRED TO ME TODAY

12:13.300 --> 12:15.300
THAT I NEVER
REALLY EXPLAINED TO YOU

12:15.300 --> 12:17.000
ABOUT THAT GIFT
I GAVE YOU THIS MORNING.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.300
IT'S OK, DAD.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.467
A GIFT LIKE THAT DOESN'T
REALLY NEED EXPLAINING.

12:20.467 --> 12:21.867
NO, WELL,
I EXPLAINED TO ERIC

12:21.867 --> 12:23.567
ABOUT GRANDPA'S BUCK KNIFE
AFTER I GAVE IT TO HIM.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.000
AND HAVE I
TOLD YOU LATELY

12:25.000 --> 12:26.900
JUST HOW MUCH I LOVE
THAT KNIFE, DAD?

12:29.567 --> 12:32.600
YOU KNOW,
IN THE NAVY,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.100
I WAS ON
THE BOXING TEAM.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.300
REALLY?

12:35.300 --> 12:36.767
YEAH, I WASN'T
HALF BAD EITHER.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.734
SO YOU USED TO GET IN THE RING
AND DUKE IT OUT WITH OTHER GUYS?

12:38.734 --> 12:39.967
MM-HMM.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.300
BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH THE SILVER MITTENS?

12:42.300 --> 12:44.300
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
SILVER MITTENS.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.934
THEY'RE SILVER GLOVES.

12:45.934 --> 12:48.567
I WON THEM FOR COMING
IN SECOND PLACE.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.100
IS SECOND PLACE
THAT GOOD?

12:50.100 --> 12:52.300
I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY
TWO GUYS IN THE RING.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.867
NOT SECOND PLACE
IN ONE BOXING MATCH.

12:54.867 --> 12:56.567
SECOND IN
MY WEIGHT DIVISION

12:56.567 --> 12:58.867
IN THE ENTIRE
UNITED STATES NAVY.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.000
WHAT?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.033
YEAH. THAT'S WHY
I'M SO PROUD

13:04.033 --> 13:07.033
OF THOSE LITTLE
SILVER GLOVES.

13:07.033 --> 13:08.600
SO, WHO'D YOU
LOSE TO, DAD?

13:08.600 --> 13:11.500
OH, THE BADDEST,
MEANEST,

13:11.500 --> 13:12.967
UGLIEST GUY
IN THE NAVY.

13:12.967 --> 13:14.567
I FOUGHT HIM IN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT.

13:14.567 --> 13:17.233
DID YOU HEAR THAT, COR?
THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

13:17.233 --> 13:18.233
I HEARD.

13:18.233 --> 13:19.767
OH, THIS WAS
A BRUTAL FIGHT.

13:19.767 --> 13:20.967
WAS THERE BLOOD?

13:20.967 --> 13:23.400
OH, BUCKETS.
BUCKETS!

13:23.400 --> 13:26.300
SEE, THE FUNNY THING IS,
I THOUGHT IT WAS HIS BLOOD.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.700
I THOUGHT
I HAD THE FIGHT WON

13:27.700 --> 13:29.600
TILL THE REFEREE HELD UP
THE OTHER GUY'S ARM.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.233
SEE, MY EYE WAS KIND OF
HANGING OUT OF ITS SOCKET.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.667
WHICH I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED
BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING

13:33.667 --> 13:36.300
AT HIS HEAD AND HIS SHOES
AT THE SAME TIME.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.500
BOY, DAD,

13:37.500 --> 13:38.934
YOU REALLY MUST HAVE
FOUGHT YOUR HEART OUT

13:38.934 --> 13:41.100
TO WIN THOSE LITTLE
SILVER GLOVES.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.300
YEAH, SO I LOST
A LITTLE DEPTH PERCEPTION.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.867
BUT TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, COR,

13:45.867 --> 13:47.900
AS GOOD AS IT WAS
TO WIN THOSE SILVER GLOVES,

13:47.900 --> 13:49.567
WHAT WAS GREAT WAS HOPING

13:49.567 --> 13:54.000
THAT SOMEDAY I'D HAVE
A SON TO PASS THEM ON TO.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.200
AND DID YOU?

13:55.200 --> 13:58.467
YES, I DID, HUH?

13:58.467 --> 13:59.834
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU GUYS'D JUST LIKE

13:59.834 --> 14:02.700
TO HEAR ABOUT IT,
SO I'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.734
SEE YOU, DAD.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.834
NO, THEY'RE NOT MITTENS
ON A CHAIN, OK?

14:16.834 --> 14:19.133
THEY HAPPEN TO BE
THE SILVER BOXING GLOVES

14:19.133 --> 14:20.600
OF THE SECOND BEST BOXER

14:20.600 --> 14:22.400
IN THE WHOLE
UNITED STATES NAVY.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.667
YEAH. YEAH--
OK, THANKS.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.233
THEY'RE NOT AT THE COMIC BOOK
STORE EITHER?

14:28.233 --> 14:31.233
NO. THEY'RE NOWHERE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

14:31.233 --> 14:32.500
BUT I'M GONNA FIND THEM.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.834
I'M GONNA RETRACE
EVERY STEP I TOOK TODAY.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.967
YOU KNOW, COR, IF YOU
JUST KEPT THEM WRAPPED UP

14:36.967 --> 14:38.133
LIKE MY BUCK KNIFE,

14:38.133 --> 14:39.900
NONE OF THIS EVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.367
YOU TOLD ME
TO WEAR THEM!

14:41.367 --> 14:45.000
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO KNOW
WHEN TO IGNORE ME.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.467
HUH? LOOK.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.500
I THOUGHT THAT KNIFE DIDN'T
MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.700
OH, IT DOESN'T.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.200
I JUST MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE IT DOES.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.800
I MEAN,
I KEEP IT WRAPPED UP,

14:53.800 --> 14:55.567
AND I POLISH IT.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.233
I MEAN,
I MIGHT NOT BE INTO IT,

14:57.233 --> 14:58.600
BUT MAYBE
MY KID WILL GET

14:58.600 --> 15:01.233
A KICK OUT OF IT
SOMEDAY, HUH?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.400
ERIC...

15:02.400 --> 15:03.500
YEAH?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.100
I'VE GOT TO FIND
THOSE GLOVES

15:05.100 --> 15:06.734
AND I NEED YOU
TO COVER FOR ME.

15:06.734 --> 15:08.967
JUST TELL MOM AND DAD
I WENT TO SHAWN'S FOR DINNER.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.300
OK, YOU'RE COVERED.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.567
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

15:11.567 --> 15:14.233
HEY, BE CAREFUL.
NOT THAT I CARE.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.133
CORY, DINNER.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.233

15:27.233 --> 15:29.667
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, NO, WAIT, I DO KNOW.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.367
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
GO TO SHAWN'S FOR DINNER,

15:31.367 --> 15:32.700
AND I TOLD HIM
TO GO RIGHT AHEAD.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.867
OH, AND YOU FELT THAT

15:33.867 --> 15:35.800
THAT WAS IN THE REALM
OF YOUR AUTHORITY?

15:35.800 --> 15:38.600
I DID. AFTER ALL,
I AM THE OLDEST BOY

GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.467
HELLO, SHAWN.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.400
HOW YOU GUYS DOING?
IS CORY HERE?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.100
NO, OF COURSE
HE'S NOT, SHAWN.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.300
AS YOU WELL KNOW,

16:01.300 --> 16:03.233

HAVING DINNER.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.767
RIGHT, RIGHT.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.300
CORY IS AT MY HOUSE
AND I DID KNOW THAT.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.367
ERIC WOULD BE
CORRECT THERE.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.967
WELL, THEN WHY
ARE YOU HERE?

16:14.967 --> 16:18.100
WHY AM I, AS IN <i>ME, </i>HERE?

16:20.200 --> 16:22.967
I THINK THAT'S ONE
ERIC COULD HANDLE. ERIC?

16:22.967 --> 16:24.200
UM, IT'S PLAIN AS DAY.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.000
OH, WELL, OF COURSE.
SURE.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.133
SEE, OBVIOUSLY CORY
SENT SHAWN OVER HERE

16:29.133 --> 16:30.600
TO SEE WHAT WE WERE
HAVING FOR DINNER

16:30.600 --> 16:33.300
TO DECIDE IF HE MADE
THE WISE CHOICE

16:33.300 --> 16:36.500
IN GOING TO SHAWN'S
HOUSE FOR DINNER.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.033
AND WHY DIDN'T HE
JUST CALL?

16:38.033 --> 16:40.767
HA HA! SHAWN,
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.934

16:43.934 --> 16:47.133
NO-- NO, IT'S NOT PATHETIC.

16:47.133 --> 16:48.667
IT'S NOT PATHETIC FOR ME

16:48.667 --> 16:50.300
BECAUSE I'M NOT IN THIS FAMILY,

16:50.300 --> 16:51.600
SO I CAN LEAVE.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.934
ERIC, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE'S CORY?

16:56.934 --> 16:59.600

WHERE CORY IS.

ALAN, IT'S AFTER DARK.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.734
I'M KIND OF WORRIED.
SO AM I.

IN THE ADULT WORLD

17:04.734 --> 17:06.734

A BETTER COVER STORY?

THEY WERE TO YOU.

AND SAID YOU SNUCK

I GAVE THEM TO YOU.

BECAUSE YOU WANTED IT,

21:36.500 --> 21:37.900
AND I WENT TO THE STORE,

21:37.900 --> 21:39.400
AND I BOUGHT IT FOR YOU
WITH MY MONEY.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.867
DID YOU WIN THIS HORSE
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE NAVY?

21:43.934 --> 21:45.400
YES, I DID.
