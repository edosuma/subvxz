The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

00:05.196 --> 00:07.761
In New York City's war on crime,

00:07.761 --> 00:10.983
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:10.983 --> 00:12.808
of the Major Case Squad.

00:12.808 --> 00:14.968
These are their stories.

00:17.698 --> 00:22.701
♪ "Spirit in the Sky"
by Norman Greenbaum ♪

00:29.392 --> 00:32.765
God wants us to obey him.

00:32.765 --> 00:36.991
God has a plan for us.
For all of us.

00:39.582 --> 00:42.738
There's a wonderful fantasy

00:42.738 --> 00:46.956
that there's a being up in the sky
who knows all our thoughts,

00:46.956 --> 00:50.741
who cares about
the minutiae of our lives.

00:54.899 --> 01:00.770
This man needs to accept the Lord
to take Jesus Christ into his heart,

01:00.770 --> 01:03.599
to ask Jesus for strength.

01:07.570 --> 01:09.723
Does God exist?

01:09.723 --> 01:12.896
Let me ask you this.
Do miracles exist?

01:12.896 --> 01:16.209
Well, I wanna show you people
my miracle.

01:16.462 --> 01:19.158
My wife, Marjorie.

01:19.889 --> 01:22.951
I fell in love with her
the moment I met her.

01:22.951 --> 01:26.167
We both had the love for the Lord.

01:26.167 --> 01:30.103
So I prayed every night that Marjorie
would fall in love with me and...

01:30.103 --> 01:32.433
One night I asked her to marry me,

01:32.433 --> 01:35.440
and miracle of miracles,
she said yes.

01:36.984 --> 01:40.008
Tonight before the debate,
my wife, Marjorie.

01:40.008 --> 01:41.177
YOUR HUSBAND IS THE DEVIL

01:41.177 --> 01:43.190
She asked me to pray for a man.

01:43.190 --> 01:46.018
A very intelligent man,
a genius probably,

01:46.018 --> 01:50.003
whose teenage son is
so intellectually disabled,

01:50.003 --> 01:53.428
that he can no longer bear
the burden of raising him.

01:53.428 --> 01:56.685
All the intelligence in the world
would not help this man.

01:56.685 --> 01:59.139
This man needs to pray to God,

01:59.139 --> 02:03.086
to accept God's will,
to heal him.

02:03.383 --> 02:05.240
God's will?

02:05.240 --> 02:07.678
Healing power?

02:08.241 --> 02:12.795
Genetic mutations can not be
healed through prayer.

02:12.795 --> 02:17.376
If inflicting unbearable pain
is how your God test faith,

02:17.376 --> 02:20.867
then he's a vindictive son of a bitch.

02:25.828 --> 02:27.460
Calm down!

02:27.716 --> 02:28.827
Calm down!

02:28.827 --> 02:30.380
Everybody.

02:31.646 --> 02:34.167
All right, everybody.
Calm down!

02:39.294 --> 02:41.198
No violence!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2007/02/20

03:45.810 --> 03:49.012
Marjorie Riggins.
Wife of Reverend Cal Riggins.

03:49.012 --> 03:51.117
Her wallet's here, jewelry.

03:51.117 --> 03:52.638
Looks like she took a bad fall.

03:52.638 --> 03:54.821
It's an awful lot of blood for a fall.

03:54.821 --> 03:57.030
Head wounds, they bleed.

03:57.030 --> 04:00.788
Any idea why the Reverend's wife
was even in this stairwell?

04:00.788 --> 04:02.937
The audience stormed
the debate stage.

04:02.937 --> 04:04.700
She must have run
for the backstage stairs

04:04.700 --> 04:06.020
and forgotten which way to go.

04:06.020 --> 04:07.425
Which way should she have gone?

04:07.425 --> 04:09.973
Upstairs.
Not down to the green room.

04:10.310 --> 04:13.159
These footprints, campus security?

04:13.159 --> 04:15.509
No. Her husband and his entourage.

04:15.509 --> 04:17.238
They were praying over her
when we got here.

04:17.238 --> 04:21.135
They might have moved the body.
It's obviously been composed.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.140
Maybe. We had our hands full.

04:23.140 --> 04:25.559
I sent her people away
as soon as I got here.

04:26.403 --> 04:28.756
There's a void in the blood spatter here.

04:28.756 --> 04:30.607
Something was removed.

04:30.607 --> 04:32.440
Not while we were here.

04:32.776 --> 04:35.285
Well, bag this PDA separately,

04:35.285 --> 04:37.851
and get it back to us ASAP.

04:37.851 --> 04:42.038
Besides her people,
who had access to this staircase?

04:42.038 --> 04:44.939
VIPs only.
I'll get you the list.

04:47.446 --> 04:50.279
Oh, that, that's a smudge.
Excuse me.

04:52.794 --> 04:55.204
Any idea where her people went?

04:55.204 --> 04:58.359
They're in the green room,
praying.

05:00.626 --> 05:03.059
What happened is that
Dr. Corliss denounced our God.

05:03.059 --> 05:04.849
And all hell broke loose?

05:04.849 --> 05:06.390
Something like that, yes.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.092
I rushed Marjorie to the side exit.
I told her to wait right there,

05:09.092 --> 05:11.913
and then I went to
protect Reverend Cal.

05:11.913 --> 05:14.157
It's Cal. It's alright.
We can deal with this.

05:14.157 --> 05:16.468
If the Reverend doesn't mind, it's...

05:16.869 --> 05:19.128
It's OK, elder Roberts.

05:19.128 --> 05:20.983
She's my wife.

05:21.291 --> 05:23.483
And I got there too late.

05:23.704 --> 05:26.239
Did you see her fall, Reverend?

05:26.239 --> 05:30.883
No, I made eye contact from the stage,

05:30.883 --> 05:34.382
and then, there was the commotion,

05:34.382 --> 05:35.968
and then, she must have panicked.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.892
Because she went down
the stairs herself, and the...

05:38.892 --> 05:41.018
Taking the stairs is
a sign of panic?

05:41.018 --> 05:45.927
Oh, it's for her. Because
she has labyrinthitis which is...

05:45.927 --> 05:48.356
Causes vertigo.
There's medication for that.

05:48.356 --> 05:49.780
Yes, there is.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.977
But she said it made her feel stupid.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.975
She'd rather be dizzy than stupid.

05:53.975 --> 05:55.947
especially when she was practicing.

05:55.947 --> 05:57.053
She was a doctor?

05:57.053 --> 05:59.539
She was a pediatric ophthalmologist.

05:59.539 --> 06:01.746
And the labyrinthitis,
what triggered it?

06:01.746 --> 06:04.162
She's had it her whole life.

06:04.162 --> 06:07.044
She had trouble with motion and...

06:07.044 --> 06:11.825
This damn tour,
it's so much traveling and...

06:11.825 --> 06:14.913
She fainted earlier tonight.

06:15.562 --> 06:19.541
Was she under any particular stress?

06:22.500 --> 06:26.743
Did you see or hear anyone
on the stairs?

06:28.013 --> 06:29.646
No.

06:29.869 --> 06:31.434
We went up the stairs,

06:31.434 --> 06:33.386
and when we realized
Marjorie wasn't there,

06:33.386 --> 06:37.083
I went to look for her,
and I found her.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.386
Did you move her body?

06:38.386 --> 06:42.796
No, I didn't move her body.
I ran after Cal.

06:45.512 --> 06:47.749
Her body was in such a peaceful pose.

06:47.749 --> 06:51.318
I mean, for suffering such a trauma.

06:51.318 --> 06:53.142
I did it.

06:53.744 --> 06:55.438
I thought she was still alive,

06:55.438 --> 06:59.452
so I picked up her head
and cradled her

06:59.452 --> 07:02.370
and started praying for her.

07:02.788 --> 07:05.673
And that's when Dr. Corliss came.

07:05.673 --> 07:07.616
And he said she was gone.

07:07.616 --> 07:09.746
Dr. Corliss.

07:09.926 --> 07:12.364
You'll probably find him
outside the auditorium.

07:12.364 --> 07:14.177
He smokes.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.738
His whole flock praying,

07:16.738 --> 07:20.996
Riggins was laying hands on her,
then suddenly faith be damned.

07:20.996 --> 07:24.488
They ran for me and
wanted medical expertise.

07:24.857 --> 07:27.769
After I told them she was gone.

07:28.348 --> 07:32.146
They posed her hands in prayer.

07:32.444 --> 07:34.660
Her husband told us
she didn't head to the stairs

07:34.660 --> 07:36.480
until the melee broke out.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.983
It's possible.
I didn't see her.

07:40.370 --> 07:44.909
After his crusaders stormed the stage,
I, I cut out.

07:44.909 --> 07:47.445
His crusaders,
did you recognize them?

07:47.445 --> 07:50.436
He has some zealots following the tour.

07:50.436 --> 07:53.361
We were on a ten-city tour,
Old time oratory.

07:53.361 --> 07:57.907
Creationism versus evolution.
God versus no God.

07:58.488 --> 08:01.958
I'm trying to save the country
from intelligent design.

08:01.958 --> 08:04.315
And sell your book?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.903
He's after the big prize.

08:07.903 --> 08:09.660
Beat back the devil.

08:09.660 --> 08:12.184
Become the next Billy Graham.

08:14.101 --> 08:16.268
It's hard to die from falling
down the stairs.

08:16.268 --> 08:18.265
It's basically a series of 8-inch falls.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.151
Your natural instincts
is to cover your head.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.411
- But Marjorie didn't.
- No.

08:22.411 --> 08:25.917
And I found some trauma
I don't associate with the fall.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.659
Tiny petechial hemorrhages
in the eyes and brain,

08:28.659 --> 08:31.961
You usually see those in children
with shaken baby syndrome.

08:31.961 --> 08:34.402
So, you're saying
someone shook her violently.

08:34.402 --> 08:36.620
Yeah, maybe.
I'll know better by tomorrow,

08:36.620 --> 08:39.621
if bruises appear on her arms
where somebody hoisted her up.

08:39.621 --> 08:42.941
And, shook her and then threw her
down headfirst.

08:42.941 --> 08:44.866
- She was murdered.
- Yeah, probably.

08:44.866 --> 08:47.932
But with her labyrinthitis,
it won't be hard to find expert witnesses

08:47.932 --> 08:50.472
who attribute her injuries
to her extreme vertigo.

08:50.472 --> 08:52.503
If her killer knew about her labyrinthitis

08:52.503 --> 08:54.926
then he give himself a good cover story.

08:57.398 --> 09:01.910
Oh, boy, this preacher,
just another big phony.

09:01.910 --> 09:06.803
You know, he wants a Constitutional
amendment to ban gay marriage.

09:06.803 --> 09:11.033
All right. Sure like to see
what goes on in that bedroom.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.363
Why are you defending him?

09:12.363 --> 09:13.715
I'm not defending him.

09:13.715 --> 09:15.232
They're charlatans these people.

09:15.232 --> 09:17.785
He's supposed to be a believer,
in which case he's supposed to believe

09:17.785 --> 09:21.074
that God had a reason
for her death, right?

09:21.074 --> 09:22.906
So, why is he crying?

09:26.534 --> 09:27.820
What is he doing here?

09:27.820 --> 09:29.234
Dr. Sylveste.

09:29.234 --> 09:32.513
I see the patient's
her usual shy self.

09:32.513 --> 09:34.177
No!

09:36.557 --> 09:37.959
- Bobby.
- Yes.

09:37.959 --> 09:40.029
- I wanna go back to my room.
- I... I know, mom.

09:40.029 --> 09:41.928
You know, everybody
tiptoes around me.

09:41.928 --> 09:44.276
You know why,
because on my chart, it says,

09:44.276 --> 09:46.358
it says that I'm a schizophrenic.

09:46.358 --> 09:48.592
So, in that case,
why don't they just send me back

09:48.592 --> 09:52.985
to my room in the nut house,
not a hospital, not a hospice?

09:52.985 --> 09:55.052
You're almost there, Mrs. Goren.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.837
She's handling the chemo very well.

09:56.837 --> 09:59.102
Come on, I really am.
Look at this.

09:59.102 --> 10:01.819
Now, listen, I am done with all of this.

10:01.819 --> 10:03.814
You tell them that.

10:03.814 --> 10:05.977
- OK, I'll do that.
- Good.

10:05.977 --> 10:07.497
I'll tell them.

10:07.497 --> 10:09.115
I'll do that, OK?

10:09.115 --> 10:11.790
We're gonna go outside
for a minute, OK?

10:11.976 --> 10:14.571
If your brother were here,
I wouldn't have gone through all this.

10:14.571 --> 10:16.256
Ma, I'm just gonna be out here.

10:16.256 --> 10:19.113
He, he would have taken care of me.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.649
Rodgers says the bruise
showed up on Marjorie's arms.

10:27.649 --> 10:29.437
It's a homicide.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.210
So CSU have anything?

10:31.210 --> 10:33.398
That stairway smudge tested
positive for her blood.

10:33.398 --> 10:35.164
No way it happened in the fall.

10:35.164 --> 10:37.047
How many people had
access to the stairwell?

10:37.047 --> 10:38.753
There was a VIP list.

10:38.753 --> 10:41.936
Corliss didn't have anyone.
The Reverend had an entourage.

10:41.936 --> 10:44.247
His people vouch for
all the names except one.

10:44.247 --> 10:45.864
A Mr. Diego.

10:45.864 --> 10:48.923
Marjorie left him a comp
and a backstage pass.

10:48.923 --> 10:51.272
She listed him
as a friend of the church.

10:51.272 --> 10:52.731
You're not convinced.

10:52.731 --> 10:55.965
I checked her PDA,
found his cell number.

10:55.965 --> 10:58.798
When you call it, Diego directs
you to a web site,

10:58.798 --> 11:02.867
because as he says,
seeing is believing.

11:03.141 --> 11:04.902
You're kidding.

11:04.902 --> 11:07.852
Rend this hunk. Diego.

11:07.852 --> 11:12.725
By the hour or by the night.
Muscular, tanned, relentless.

11:12.725 --> 11:15.199
We can all read, captain.

11:15.199 --> 11:19.158
What would a preacher's wife
want with a rent boy?

11:25.941 --> 11:29.741
Mr. Diego's web site is purely
in the realm of personal fantasy.

11:29.741 --> 11:32.004
No services are exchanged for.

11:32.004 --> 11:34.795
My partner was in Vice for five years.

11:34.795 --> 11:39.290
Chelsea for two of those years.
You're not my first rent boy, Diego.

11:39.540 --> 11:42.217
Now, we don't have to
shut down you web site.

11:42.217 --> 11:47.239
We just wanna know why Reverend
Cal's wife has your name in her PDA.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.187
Listen, I swear to you.
I never even met the woman.

11:50.187 --> 11:53.902
And she left you a backstage
pass for the debate,

11:53.902 --> 11:56.333
the night she died.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.604
Is that because you're a big fan of
intelligent design?

11:59.604 --> 12:01.632
Is, is that what it is?

12:03.835 --> 12:05.806
She's an ophthalmologist.

12:05.806 --> 12:08.011
I wrote her a letter about my nephew.

12:08.011 --> 12:10.751
He's going blind, and
he can't afford the surgery.

12:10.751 --> 12:15.641
I asked her to waive her surgical fee
as an act of Christian charity.

12:15.641 --> 12:18.237
But you don't have a nephew.

12:18.997 --> 12:23.268
Oh... uh... I get it.

12:23.268 --> 12:26.904
You've seen that DVD.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.375
The DVD, the one in the envelope,

12:34.997 --> 12:36.927
that you left for her.

12:36.927 --> 12:40.274
I hope you liked my work, detective.

12:40.274 --> 12:41.380
It was impressive.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.084
So, did you stay through the melee?

12:43.084 --> 12:46.419
No, I put the DVD on the chair,
watched her pick it up,

12:46.419 --> 12:50.132
then I left for a session.

12:50.132 --> 12:55.687
But if you ask my client, discretely,

12:55.687 --> 13:00.483
I am sure that he will confirm that.

13:01.937 --> 13:04.348
- This DVD, was it for blackmail?
- No.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.093
I mean, not for money.

13:06.093 --> 13:10.383
The preacher is spear-heading a Constitutional
amendment to ban gay marriage.

13:10.383 --> 13:12.807
I just wanted her to get Cal to shut up

13:12.807 --> 13:16.186
about homosexuality
being the work of Satan.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.988
How long has Riggins been your client?

13:19.849 --> 13:20.999
Three years.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.883
He calls me when
he comes to New York.

13:22.883 --> 13:25.949
He flew me to Miami
a couple of times, and Vegas.

13:25.949 --> 13:29.047
How did he pay and
what exactly did you do for him?

13:29.047 --> 13:30.711
Plastic at first and cash.

13:30.711 --> 13:33.607
And I do whatever he wants me to do.

13:33.607 --> 13:36.272
But he likes crystal meth,
especially booty bumps.

13:36.272 --> 13:37.676
- Booty bumps.
- That's when you actually thought...

13:37.676 --> 13:39.180
- I know what they are.
- All right.

13:39.180 --> 13:42.847
The man is one of the most
self-loathing guys I've ever met.

13:42.847 --> 13:44.949
- And did he loathe you, too?
- Oh, yeah.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.494
Call me names. I thought
he was gonna kill me once.

13:47.494 --> 13:52.133
But then, you know,
turned a song, and we...

13:52.133 --> 13:55.393
Well, you saw the footage.

13:57.015 --> 14:00.018
Well, we're gonna
need a copy of this DVD.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.733
You don't have it.

14:01.733 --> 14:04.228
We appreciate your telling us about it.

14:04.228 --> 14:06.479
Oh, that's not fair.
I thought...

14:06.479 --> 14:09.615
Detectives, we may be
able to produce a copy.

14:09.615 --> 14:13.963
But that's subject to negotiation.
My client's invoking.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.753
I miss Vice.

14:18.753 --> 14:21.173
People doing stuff for money.

14:21.173 --> 14:23.628
Guys like this, I get them.

14:23.839 --> 14:28.111
OK, then do you get any sense
Diego could have killed Marjorie Riggins?

14:28.111 --> 14:29.803
Why would he?

14:29.803 --> 14:31.751
He wanted Marjorie
to pressure her husband.

14:31.751 --> 14:33.722
Killing her doesn't get him anything.

14:33.722 --> 14:35.330
It wasn't him.

14:35.330 --> 14:36.833
It was whoever took the DVD.

14:36.833 --> 14:39.882
The killer wanted to make sure
that she never had a chance to watch it.

14:39.882 --> 14:41.520
Someone from the church.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.407
Maybe the Reverend himself.
Where is he?

14:43.407 --> 14:48.093
He's staying at their new hundred
million dollar evangelical institute.

14:48.093 --> 14:50.234
Pay him a condolence call.

14:52.817 --> 14:53.940
The guest list?

14:53.940 --> 14:56.603
Reverend, your cup runneth over.

14:56.912 --> 15:00.899
Oh, I thought my staff
already went over there.

15:00.899 --> 15:04.683
There's just one odd man out.

15:04.683 --> 15:07.461
This one. Do you know him?

15:09.738 --> 15:11.599
No. I don't believe I do.

15:11.599 --> 15:15.684
He told us you've been his client
for the last three years.

15:19.889 --> 15:23.812
His client?
I don't think so.

15:23.812 --> 15:25.830
Maybe he works in accounting
or he's doing around here...

15:25.830 --> 15:27.938
He's been in touch with your wife.

15:27.938 --> 15:30.246
She left him a backstage pass.

15:30.246 --> 15:32.279
He claims to know you personally.

15:32.279 --> 15:35.391
Well, a lot of people
claim to know me personally.

15:35.391 --> 15:36.696
Did you say his name?

15:36.696 --> 15:40.034
Diego? We have other photos.

15:40.034 --> 15:42.566
You know, there is a Diego

15:42.566 --> 15:45.846
that is a professional massage
therapist, but I...

15:45.846 --> 15:48.498
It's so dark in those rooms,
so I can't...

15:48.498 --> 15:50.604
Do you have a massage therapist?

15:50.604 --> 15:53.141
Is he your massage therapist?

15:53.141 --> 15:54.776
I can't say for sure.

15:54.776 --> 15:57.638
I'm really sorry, detectives,
that I can't be more helpful.

15:57.638 --> 16:02.572
Actually, it's always helpful
when we know someone's lying to us.

16:04.257 --> 16:09.657
There seem to be phone calls
from your cell to his.

16:11.032 --> 16:13.847
Actually, this is...

16:14.031 --> 16:18.164
You know what? This is Diego.

16:18.164 --> 16:22.412
Yeah, it's funny.
The back pain I get

16:22.412 --> 16:24.952
is so crippling
that I can't even think.

16:24.952 --> 16:26.984
I just lay there,
and I close my eyes...

16:26.984 --> 16:29.775
And wait for that booty bump?

16:32.284 --> 16:35.105
There's a lady in the room, detective.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.379
I'll wait outside.

16:48.628 --> 16:50.272
How is he?

16:50.272 --> 16:54.346
He seems almost stricken.

16:54.652 --> 16:58.434
It's such a terrible loss,
for all of us.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.219
We're a family.

17:00.219 --> 17:04.977
In this family, who handles
the Reverend's credit card bills?

17:04.977 --> 17:06.448
Well, I do.

17:06.448 --> 17:10.098
Because sometimes
when something like this occurs,

17:10.098 --> 17:15.507
some predators try to open accounts
using the deceased's identity.

17:15.507 --> 17:16.724
You have to notify...

17:16.724 --> 17:19.030
Oh, I know, I already did.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.333
I learned my lesson the last time.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.452
The last time?

17:22.452 --> 17:26.396
Well, you know, the old imp is
always trying to find a way in.

17:26.396 --> 17:28.796
Who is the old imp?

17:28.796 --> 17:31.478
I'm sorry. That's what my mother
used to call him.

17:31.478 --> 17:33.478
The devil is the modern term.

17:33.478 --> 17:36.007
Like that man who cloned
the Reverend's credit card.

17:36.007 --> 17:38.781
That's something an imp would do,
don't you think?

17:38.781 --> 17:42.565
Ah... Someone cloned his card?

17:42.565 --> 17:45.356
- Identity theft?
- No, it was just the one.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.760
But you know what they used it for?

17:47.760 --> 17:50.330
Prostitutes.

17:50.330 --> 17:53.001
He hit the roof when I told him.

17:53.001 --> 17:55.588
I'll bet he did.

17:56.178 --> 17:58.769
I don't know anything about any DVD.

17:58.769 --> 18:01.230
Listen, I've lost my wife.

18:01.230 --> 18:02.955
Why are you doing this now?

18:02.955 --> 18:09.013
The medical examiner believes
that your wife was murdered, Reverend.

18:09.436 --> 18:12.356
Do you know anyone who
would want to kill your wife

18:12.356 --> 18:15.229
or hurt you by killing her?

18:15.229 --> 18:17.480
Of course, I have enemies.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.767
What kind of enemies?

18:22.932 --> 18:24.212
Demons.

18:24.212 --> 18:25.998
Your demons?

18:27.208 --> 18:30.490
Are they inside,
or are they outside?

18:31.698 --> 18:33.760
Both.

18:38.321 --> 18:40.150
Detectives,

18:40.150 --> 18:43.296
If you'll excuse us please,
the Reverend has an urgent meeting.

18:43.296 --> 18:46.033
I'm sorry, forgive me.

18:54.891 --> 18:57.375
All right. That was Ross.

18:57.375 --> 19:00.133
Diego's lawyer called.
His apartment was broken into.

19:00.133 --> 19:03.657
His laptop and webcams were stolen
while he was with us.

19:03.657 --> 19:05.121
No DVD.

19:05.121 --> 19:08.738
And the Reverend swears
that he knows nothing about a DVD.

19:09.177 --> 19:12.850
Which means we're looking for something
that may not exist.

19:12.850 --> 19:15.443
There might be a paper trail
linking him to Diego.

19:15.443 --> 19:19.461
Riggins gave his secretary
some cover story about identity theft,

19:19.461 --> 19:22.808
but someone in the church
must be onto him.

19:27.614 --> 19:29.522
Hey, Bobby.

19:39.004 --> 19:40.789
What are you doing here?

19:41.801 --> 19:43.475
Church people.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.353
They're good people, man.

19:46.285 --> 19:47.370
Yeah, I know.

19:47.370 --> 19:50.755
They get me clean, feed me.

19:50.755 --> 19:53.549
I would have been dead long time ago,
if it weren't for them.

19:53.549 --> 19:55.464
I mean it.

19:58.435 --> 20:00.592
How you doing?

20:02.878 --> 20:05.247
So, how's mom?

20:11.393 --> 20:12.765
My phone?

20:13.046 --> 20:14.899
No, I got into a thing
with the phone company.

20:14.899 --> 20:16.430
If you left me messages,
I'm sure they have them,

20:16.430 --> 20:19.904
- but they won't let me access them.
- Yeah, sure.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.233
So, how sick is she?

20:23.542 --> 20:27.276
She's not good.
I've been looking into experimental...

20:27.852 --> 20:29.335
She's not good.

20:29.335 --> 20:31.728
Just try prayer, Bobby.

20:31.936 --> 20:34.160
It works miracles.

20:36.891 --> 20:39.706
Mom's always talking about you.

20:39.928 --> 20:43.915
She always asking me, why didn't I
become a scientist like you?

20:44.757 --> 20:46.974
She always believed in me.

20:48.924 --> 20:50.696
I gotta go.

20:50.696 --> 20:53.129
That's my old lady over there.

20:55.509 --> 20:57.639
She's a little shy.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.301
That woman...

21:01.167 --> 21:02.593
Is that your wife?

21:02.593 --> 21:05.312
That's, that's my partner.

21:05.776 --> 21:08.996
- So what are you waiting for?
- No, it's not that kind of partner.

21:08.996 --> 21:13.049
Look, I'm going to see mom on Sunday.

21:13.430 --> 21:15.870
I'm thinking that maybe
we could go together and see her.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.947
You know, we could meet here.

21:17.947 --> 21:19.588
Yeah, I know, it's her birthday, right?

21:19.588 --> 21:21.027
Yeah.

21:21.593 --> 21:23.949
No, man, I don't think so.
I got, you know,

21:23.949 --> 21:26.119
- I'm a little short this month.
- Yeah, well, look... uh...

21:26.119 --> 21:29.266
That's alright, alright.
It's OK. Look, here.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.641
Hey, look, just take this, alright?

21:32.641 --> 21:33.879
Thanks.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.302
I'm gonna pay you
back on Sunday, OK? Huh?

21:38.302 --> 21:40.030
So, we meet right here?

21:40.030 --> 21:41.828
Crack of noon?

21:42.929 --> 21:44.918
- I'll give you my coat.
- No, I don't...

21:44.918 --> 21:46.823
Yeah, you're cold, man.

21:47.579 --> 21:50.014
- Sure you don't need it?
- Yeah, don't be silly.

21:50.014 --> 21:52.978
- It's nice, it's nice.
- Yeah, a good coat.

21:54.941 --> 21:57.149
So, uh...

21:58.006 --> 22:02.495
I'm gonna put my card
in your pocket here.

22:03.523 --> 22:06.981
I want you to call me if...
if you need anything,

22:06.981 --> 22:09.741
call me and ask me, OK?

22:09.741 --> 22:12.483
But I'll see you here. Noon.

22:12.483 --> 22:14.085
I'll be here.

22:16.067 --> 22:17.912
Thanks, bro.

22:21.752 --> 22:23.332
Alright.

22:28.725 --> 22:29.900
Come here, baby.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.643
The DA says no probable cause.

22:32.643 --> 22:36.460
You're asking for a search warrant based
on the guesswork of a gay male escort,

22:36.460 --> 22:38.292
who may have been blackmailing Riggins.

22:38.292 --> 22:40.085
- It's a tough sell.
- Yeah, but doesn't matter.

22:40.085 --> 22:42.522
'Cause everyone in the church denies
they ever saw the DVD.

22:42.522 --> 22:45.036
And if anybody did take it,

22:45.036 --> 22:46.874
- they would have destroyed it by now.
- Thanks.

22:46.874 --> 22:49.722
Riggins' credit card company
confirmed the theft.

22:49.722 --> 22:52.387
They deactivated the account,
refunded the money,

22:52.387 --> 22:54.081
and issued a new number.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.971
That doesn't mean they
weren't his charges.

22:55.971 --> 22:59.811
It just means that someone convinced
the credit card company to write them off.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.422
We're hitting a church wall.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.067
His people are gonna
protect the Reverend.

23:03.067 --> 23:07.151
Did anyone else see Marjorie's body
before campus security arrived?

23:07.151 --> 23:08.922
Dr. Corliss.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.139
Must be frustrating.

23:11.139 --> 23:13.138
Try to conduct an investigation
within a group

23:13.138 --> 23:16.269
that's entirely invested in irrationality.

23:16.269 --> 23:21.530
Ah, well, homicides are
often irrational, as well.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.377
So, Marjorie's death
has been ruled a homicide?

23:23.377 --> 23:25.088
Yeah, it looks that way.

23:25.271 --> 23:28.534
These people, they're fanatics.

23:30.453 --> 23:35.524
You seem to assume that the murder
had to do with someone at the church.

23:35.524 --> 23:39.046
There're also agnostics
and atheist at the debate.

23:39.046 --> 23:41.293
I'm sorry. Of course, you're right.

23:41.293 --> 23:45.178
I guess my bias against
the Religious Right is surfacing.

23:45.178 --> 23:48.073
I resent the way they treated
Marjorie on the tour.

23:48.073 --> 23:49.393
They treated her badly?

23:49.393 --> 23:50.899
A brilliant doctor.

23:50.899 --> 23:53.378
They turned her into a prop.

23:53.378 --> 23:56.713
Well, we're more interested in
what you remember after you found her.

23:56.713 --> 23:58.673
She was given a DVD that night.

23:58.673 --> 24:00.960
It didn't turn up with her belongings.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.918
I didn't see a DVD.

24:02.918 --> 24:05.004
Everything was scattered
around the stairs.

24:05.004 --> 24:07.013
How about an envelope?

24:07.013 --> 24:09.999
Yes, the Reverend had one, manila.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.925
He was clutching it.

24:19.399 --> 24:23.618
G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis.

24:23.618 --> 24:25.381
And Ripped boys magazine,

24:25.381 --> 24:29.113
which one of these things
is not like the others.

24:29.649 --> 24:32.883
Uh, excuse me,
what are you people doing here?

24:32.883 --> 24:34.996
Executing a search warrant.

24:34.996 --> 24:37.089
You're welcome to stay.

24:37.768 --> 24:43.233
We're looking for the DVD
that Diego said he gave to your wife.

24:43.233 --> 24:47.282
Well, as I told you before, Miss,
I don't know anything about it, so...

24:47.282 --> 24:51.192
Turns out Diego was secretly
taping your massages.

24:51.192 --> 24:54.250
He gave Marjorie a copy.

25:03.582 --> 25:05.286
What have I done?

25:06.121 --> 25:10.147
You made yourself a pretty good
suspect for her murder.

25:13.081 --> 25:15.299
Did Marjorie see it?

25:15.691 --> 25:18.306
You tell us.
Did she mention it to you?

25:18.306 --> 25:19.804
No.

25:22.482 --> 25:26.094
Before the debate,
she came up into the green room.

25:26.094 --> 25:28.709
Then she asked me
if I knew Diego.

25:28.709 --> 25:31.624
And you said no.

25:31.861 --> 25:34.053
I couldn't tell her.

25:34.053 --> 25:38.833
'Cause I knew that God was gonna
punish me for what I was doing.

25:38.833 --> 25:41.958
'Cause I knew
that it was wrong.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.685
But you couldn't stop?

25:45.363 --> 25:49.525
No, I couldn't stop.

25:52.195 --> 25:55.257
I'm so sorry, Marjorie.

25:56.178 --> 25:59.880
I hear you're looking for a DVD.
You're wasting your time.

26:00.536 --> 26:02.472
It's gone.

26:04.325 --> 26:06.317
You knew about it?

26:07.229 --> 26:11.066
Well, then you must have taken it out
from Marjorie after she was killed.

26:11.066 --> 26:12.968
Is that true?

26:13.571 --> 26:17.498
Cal, I told you not to talk to the police
or to listen to them.

26:17.498 --> 26:19.963
You have nothing to worry about,
do you understand?

26:19.963 --> 26:22.034
Now I'm gonna call the lawyer.

26:22.550 --> 26:23.789
Tell you what,

26:23.789 --> 26:27.162
why don't you just have him
meet you downtown?

26:28.911 --> 26:31.812
Yes, I knew about the sickness
that Cal was suffering.

26:31.812 --> 26:33.724
I saw the credit card receipts.

26:33.724 --> 26:36.787
I paid some of these people
to stay away from him.

26:36.787 --> 26:39.872
Did you talk to Marjorie Riggins
about Diego?

26:39.872 --> 26:42.193
I told her that a man was stalking Cal

26:42.193 --> 26:43.758
and that we were taking care of it.

26:43.758 --> 26:45.788
How were you taking care of it?

26:45.788 --> 26:47.186
What are you implying?

26:47.186 --> 26:50.903
Maybe you weren't the first person
to find Marjorie's body.

26:50.903 --> 26:54.631
Maybe you were the last person
to see her alive.

26:55.638 --> 26:57.776
How can you even think that?

26:57.776 --> 26:59.581
You took the DVD. Why?

26:59.581 --> 27:02.618
There was no DVD.
It never existed.

27:02.618 --> 27:03.559
Really? That's too bad for you,

27:03.559 --> 27:07.372
because Diego kept a copy
in a safe deposit box.

27:07.372 --> 27:09.235
I don't know if you knew that.

27:09.235 --> 27:11.123
We have it here.
I can play it for you here,

27:11.123 --> 27:13.401
now, if you like.

27:13.401 --> 27:14.561
No.

27:14.862 --> 27:17.442
- No.
- Here, catch, just.

27:20.153 --> 27:22.366
Something wrong with your arm?

27:22.366 --> 27:24.762
I have a frozen shoulder.

27:24.762 --> 27:27.211
Rotator cuff thing?

27:27.448 --> 27:32.014
You should have told us.
Because, whoever killed Marjorie,

27:32.014 --> 27:34.773
shook her like a rag doll.

27:34.773 --> 27:37.590
And you don't have the strength.

27:39.166 --> 27:41.483
What I'm struggling to understand here

27:41.483 --> 27:46.393
is why you are more suspicious of us
than of a blackmailing prostitute.

27:46.393 --> 27:48.302
Because he has an alibi.

27:48.302 --> 27:51.360
He left before the debate began.

27:51.360 --> 27:55.633
Hmm... well, not according to this.

27:56.254 --> 27:59.546
You see, one of our congregates
recorded parts of the debate

27:59.546 --> 28:01.627
on her cell phone
including the audience.

28:01.627 --> 28:06.269
And if you'll notice,
sitting in the back row is...

28:07.607 --> 28:09.692
Diego.

28:14.396 --> 28:17.042
Maybe, if you weren't
so eager to prosecute

28:17.042 --> 28:19.197
one of our flock for
Marjorie Riggins murder here,

28:19.197 --> 28:22.182
might not have overlooked
the real killer.

28:33.394 --> 28:35.690
Frank will be here.

28:35.690 --> 28:39.512
He would never forget my birthday.

28:39.512 --> 28:42.873
- Why don't you open your present?
- No, I want to wait.

28:42.873 --> 28:44.941
He'll be here.

28:47.968 --> 28:49.400
Bobby?

28:50.480 --> 28:52.724
Have you seen Frank?

28:54.281 --> 28:56.595
How... how is he?
What did he say?

28:56.595 --> 28:58.095
He's fine.

28:58.095 --> 29:01.978
Oh, good, good, of course he is.

29:03.723 --> 29:06.997
He said that he's cleaning
himself up.

29:06.997 --> 29:11.359
Ah... Frank never caught a break.
You had all the luck.

29:11.985 --> 29:13.935
Where was he?

29:14.247 --> 29:16.835
He was coming out of a church.

29:17.161 --> 29:19.941
You see that.

29:19.941 --> 29:22.285
He's going back to God.

29:22.285 --> 29:25.619
Never underestimate your brother.

29:26.794 --> 29:29.212
I was just...

29:30.244 --> 29:34.920
I'm just gonna close my eyes,
a little bit.

29:38.444 --> 29:42.065
I already told you, I put the DVD
on doctor Riggins' chair,

29:42.065 --> 29:43.901
then I left.

29:44.147 --> 29:47.003
OK, what is this about, detective?

29:47.003 --> 29:51.186
We have footage showing Diego sitting
in the audience during the debate,

29:51.186 --> 29:52.824
which means, Diego,

29:52.824 --> 29:57.109
you could have been in that auditorium
at the time of Marjorie Riggins' death.

30:00.856 --> 30:02.625
OK.

30:03.275 --> 30:06.091
True story.

30:06.462 --> 30:08.026
I stayed for a few minutes.

30:08.026 --> 30:10.603
I just wanted to make
eye contact with Cal.

30:10.603 --> 30:12.439
And I wanted to see that bastard squirm.

30:12.439 --> 30:15.703
But I left, I was gone by quarter to 8.

30:15.703 --> 30:22.505
I went to a restaurant
and I had dinner with my Mom.

30:23.429 --> 30:28.661
And I was hoping that
we could keep her out of this.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.698
You despise Reverend so much.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.675
Why take him on as a client
in the first place?

30:32.675 --> 30:34.491
I didn't know who he was
in the beginning.

30:34.491 --> 30:37.431
- He used an alias?
- Yeah, get this.

30:37.431 --> 30:40.304
He called himself James Corliss.

30:43.097 --> 30:46.499
Did you look into that new treatment
that I was talking about?

30:46.499 --> 30:50.384
Radiation-carrying monoclonal antibodies.

30:50.384 --> 30:52.451
The studies are ongoing.

30:52.451 --> 30:53.792
Yeah, but the phase 1 tests,

30:53.792 --> 30:56.192
they were very promising for someone
with my mother's type of cancer,

30:56.192 --> 30:58.120
I mean, if you could get her into a trial...

30:58.120 --> 30:59.678
They won't take her in a clinical trial.

30:59.678 --> 31:03.870
Her cancer is advanced, and
her mental health is an issue.

31:03.870 --> 31:06.612
Well, then forget the trial.
Just get the treatment.

31:06.612 --> 31:08.903
The FDA hasn't approved it yet.

31:09.298 --> 31:12.217
Well, then apply for
the compassionate use exception.

31:12.217 --> 31:13.961
Look, she's got no other option.

31:13.961 --> 31:15.894
Compassionate use.

31:15.894 --> 31:18.499
I'm afraid there may not be enough time.

31:20.423 --> 31:22.282
Well, I've been talking to
someone at the FDA,

31:22.282 --> 31:25.209
- they could help expedite...
- Mr. Goren, please.

31:25.545 --> 31:28.556
You should know your friend can help.
But the cost is prohibitive.

31:28.556 --> 31:30.238
It's not covered by medicate.

31:30.238 --> 31:32.875
The entire expense would have
to come out of pocket.

31:32.875 --> 31:36.552
- How much?
- Minimum? 5,000-6,000 dollars.

31:37.473 --> 31:38.858
For the whole treatment?

31:38.858 --> 31:41.942
No, per month.

31:42.803 --> 31:44.556
Just because the science exist

31:44.556 --> 31:47.791
doesn't always make it
the best choice for the family.

31:52.407 --> 31:55.138
Sometimes we have to rely on faith.

31:55.138 --> 31:56.197
Like this evening.

31:56.197 --> 31:58.554
Just before the debate,
my wife came to me,

31:58.554 --> 32:01.659
asked me to pray for a man.
A very intelligent man.

32:01.659 --> 32:03.670
A genius probably,

32:03.670 --> 32:07.766
whose teenage son is
so intellectually disabled,

32:07.766 --> 32:12.129
that he can no longer bear
the burden of raising him.

32:12.129 --> 32:13.714
And I told Marjorie,

32:13.714 --> 32:16.948
all the intelligence in the world
will not help this man.

32:16.948 --> 32:19.435
This man needs to accept the Lord.

32:19.435 --> 32:21.570
He needs to pray to God,

32:21.570 --> 32:24.723
to accept God's will,
to heal him.

32:24.723 --> 32:26.449
God's will?

32:27.047 --> 32:29.525
Healing power?

32:30.596 --> 32:35.068
Genetic mutation cannot be healed
through prayer.

32:35.068 --> 32:39.756
If inflicting unbearable pain is
how your God test faith,

32:39.756 --> 32:43.158
then he's a vindictive son of bitch.

32:44.759 --> 32:46.826
That's the man of reason.

32:46.826 --> 32:49.780
They debated dozens of times before.

32:49.780 --> 32:53.478
Riggins must have really hit a hot button
to make Corliss lose control.

32:53.478 --> 32:56.531
If those two hate each other so much,
why tour together?

32:56.531 --> 32:59.187
Riggins is driven
to convert the non-believer.

32:59.187 --> 33:00.665
What Corliss gets out of it,
who knows.

33:00.665 --> 33:04.047
He gets paid for it.
He gets 10 grand a debate.

33:04.929 --> 33:07.164
Corliss is in it for the money.

33:07.164 --> 33:09.655
He's a successful, single doctor,

33:09.655 --> 33:12.495
no dependents,
has a modest life style.

33:12.495 --> 33:14.796
How much cash could he need?

33:16.163 --> 33:18.258
James Corliss pays his bills on time.

33:18.258 --> 33:20.466
No debts, no mortgage.

33:20.466 --> 33:21.866
He's divorced.
What about alimony?

33:21.866 --> 33:25.119
Nope, his ex remarried in '92.
Lives in Toronto.

33:25.119 --> 33:28.366
No expenses out of the ordinary
except for this.

33:28.366 --> 33:32.046
A monthly check to Alminia S. Perez.

33:32.046 --> 33:35.165
Starting in 1990 for $2,200.

33:35.165 --> 33:37.085
Regular increases.

33:37.085 --> 33:40.250
Last month check was for $6,000.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.043
Cost of living rates?

33:42.043 --> 33:44.836
He is paying someone this
monthly expenses?

33:44.836 --> 33:48.263
Alminia Perez.
A girl friend.

33:48.263 --> 33:50.783
Any notation in the check ledger?

33:51.845 --> 33:54.016
Cleaning services.

33:54.224 --> 33:56.659
I clean house for Dr. Corliss.

33:57.209 --> 33:58.975
He's very generous.

33:58.975 --> 34:01.578
$6,000 a month.

34:02.182 --> 34:05.687
You have questions?
You should talk to Dr. Corliss.

34:06.537 --> 34:09.639
You have grand children, Miss Perez?

34:09.639 --> 34:12.645
Yes. / Child proof latches
on the cabinets.

34:12.645 --> 34:15.610
How old are they? One? Two?

34:15.610 --> 34:18.504
My grandson is two and a half.

34:18.504 --> 34:20.239
Two and a half?

34:20.706 --> 34:25.610
And he plays super champion.
That's more for an older boy.

34:30.245 --> 34:32.447
I have to go to work now.

34:32.690 --> 34:35.237
Are you expecting someone?

34:37.170 --> 34:39.312
You leave him alone, Miss.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.078
He doesn't understand.

34:45.636 --> 34:47.818
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

34:47.818 --> 34:49.507
Jimmy, this is a friend of mine.

34:49.507 --> 34:51.911
- I'm Alex.
- I like friends.

34:51.911 --> 34:54.967
Super friends.
You like them?

34:54.967 --> 34:56.458
Very much.

34:56.458 --> 34:58.724
Sometimes I work with Batman.

34:58.724 --> 35:02.213
Hang up your jacket Jimmy,
in your room.

35:05.489 --> 35:08.207
He's James Corliss' son.

35:08.811 --> 35:12.160
You've taken care of him for 17 years.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.598
Dr. Corliss, he just
couldn't keep Jimmy.

35:14.598 --> 35:16.905
His wife left.
He worked all the time.

35:16.905 --> 35:19.967
And so he paid you
to raise his child,

35:19.967 --> 35:22.686
and to keep his secret.

35:23.418 --> 35:26.384
Last month I told Dr. Corliss
I can't do it anymore.

35:26.384 --> 35:28.049
Jimmy is too big.

35:28.049 --> 35:31.013
I wanna move to Florida
with my daughter and grandson.

35:31.013 --> 35:34.013
Does Jimmy know who his parents are?

35:34.013 --> 35:36.114
We look at pictures.

35:36.114 --> 35:38.556
Does Dr. Corliss visit?

35:39.531 --> 35:41.896
He's a very busy man.

35:41.896 --> 35:44.125
Alminia, I'm hungry.

35:44.125 --> 35:46.681
Can Alex stay for cookies?

35:48.688 --> 35:51.068
James Corliss has
a mentally disabled son

35:51.068 --> 35:53.024
he's kept secret 17 years?

35:53.024 --> 35:55.168
And Corliss lost control during the debate

35:55.168 --> 35:57.375
when Riggins brought up children.

35:57.375 --> 35:58.769
Riggins found out about Jimmy.

35:58.769 --> 36:02.205
Or Corliss thought he did.
And blamed Marjorie.

36:02.205 --> 36:04.970
Interesting theory.
No proof, no witnesses.

36:04.970 --> 36:08.899
Corliss finds out you met his son,
tough getting him to talk.

36:08.899 --> 36:12.689
Not if he thinks we're going after
his archenemy, the Reverend.

36:12.689 --> 36:14.864
Don't bring the man.
Visit his lab,

36:14.864 --> 36:18.233
tell him we need him to
testify against Riggins.

36:19.623 --> 36:23.471
Cal Riggins was using church funds
to pay for gay sex?

36:23.471 --> 36:25.036
You had no idea?

36:25.036 --> 36:27.904
It's not something
I would have kept quiet, is it?

36:27.904 --> 36:29.410
Did Marjorie know?

36:29.410 --> 36:31.910
We were hoping
maybe you could tell us.

36:32.513 --> 36:34.242
You and Marjorie were both doctors.

36:34.242 --> 36:36.049
Did you know each other
before the tour?

36:36.049 --> 36:38.058
We are professional colleagues.

36:38.058 --> 36:41.038
Did you ever go to
any conferences with her?

36:41.038 --> 36:43.070
- Maybe overseas?
- It's possible.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.919
Our fields overlap.

36:44.919 --> 36:47.175
We went through her calendar.

36:47.175 --> 36:50.508
The two of you were on
several panel discussions together.

36:50.508 --> 36:53.130
Seattle, Boston.

36:53.130 --> 36:55.309
Why would you hide that from us?

36:55.309 --> 36:57.290
- What are you getting at?
- Well, you were single.

36:57.290 --> 36:59.306
Marjorie was traveling
without her husband.

36:59.306 --> 37:03.100
We even found out that two of you
in Venice together at a convention,

37:03.100 --> 37:07.216
same hotel,
Venice is a romantic city.

37:07.216 --> 37:09.248
Not for Marjorie.

37:09.248 --> 37:12.558
Venice is a killer for anybody
with any kind of motion sickness.

37:12.558 --> 37:13.967
Well, she could have taken Dramamine.

37:13.967 --> 37:15.589
Not for labyrinthitis.

37:15.589 --> 37:18.061
She said it was like the wallpaper
was crawling up the walls.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.830
I tried to tell her to have the surgery.

37:19.830 --> 37:21.365
But she wouldn't listen.

37:21.365 --> 37:24.173
So you were more than colleagues.

37:24.173 --> 37:26.817
- Did you talk about your son?
- Jimmy?

37:26.817 --> 37:29.148
Alminia told me you came by.

37:29.148 --> 37:31.289
You should have spoken
to me first, detective.

37:31.289 --> 37:34.572
I didn't know you had a son
until I got there.

37:34.932 --> 37:36.453
Cause you don't talk about him.

37:36.453 --> 37:39.865
It's not on the book jackets
that you have a child.

37:40.450 --> 37:41.796
Is it a secret?

37:41.796 --> 37:43.187
It's private.

37:43.187 --> 37:46.526
It's mine and his.
It's ours.

37:48.252 --> 37:51.542
So you could handle it as long as
it was private.

37:51.542 --> 37:53.419
That's not fair.

37:53.419 --> 37:56.565
My wife and I fell apart,
after he was born.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.536
I was single. I couldn't
take care of him properly.

37:59.536 --> 38:02.439
You're not embarrassed
about Jimmy, are you?

38:02.439 --> 38:04.728
I love my son.

38:05.906 --> 38:09.683
I cried like a baby that day I knew
there was nothing we could do,

38:09.683 --> 38:13.494
that all the science in the world
couldn't fix my child.

38:14.707 --> 38:17.127
Were you angry at God for that?

38:17.127 --> 38:19.396
No, there is no God.

38:19.396 --> 38:22.366
What happens to us is
what happens to us.

38:22.366 --> 38:26.001
And I might hate it
for Jimmy, for me.

38:26.001 --> 38:28.777
But It had nothing to do with God.

38:28.777 --> 38:34.234
Then when Riggins said at the debate
that only God could help your son...

38:34.234 --> 38:35.975
I lost it.

38:36.355 --> 38:41.868
How dare that fanatic connect
my precious son to his made-up God.

38:41.868 --> 38:43.197
What I don't get

38:43.197 --> 38:47.372
is how Reverend Riggins
even found out you had a child.

38:47.372 --> 38:48.745
I don't know.

38:48.745 --> 38:51.348
They must have been digging for something
they could use on me.

38:51.348 --> 38:52.996
That's not it.

38:53.324 --> 38:56.623
Marjorie knew about Jimmy,
didn't she?

38:58.625 --> 39:01.822
Yes. I told her.

39:01.822 --> 39:04.010
Years ago, it was very difficult time.

39:04.010 --> 39:06.581
And she was there for me.

39:06.581 --> 39:09.745
Did you ever wonder how a woman
with a scientific mind could

39:09.745 --> 39:11.886
end up with a man like Riggins?

39:11.886 --> 39:14.189
These men are cons.

39:14.189 --> 39:16.154
I begged her not to marry him.

39:16.154 --> 39:18.219
You wanted her to marry you,

39:18.219 --> 39:20.710
help raise your son.

39:21.918 --> 39:24.326
We were just friends.

39:26.923 --> 39:32.742
You, you mean that she
rejected you for Riggins.

39:33.750 --> 39:38.903
That she rejected your science
for his faith.

39:39.275 --> 39:43.565
And then, the ultimate betrayal is
that she told him about Jimmy

39:43.565 --> 39:46.750
and your pain and guilt.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.825
How could she do that to you?

39:53.970 --> 39:57.808
Look, I've done this a lot.

40:00.108 --> 40:05.613
If you confess, it feels better.

40:08.359 --> 40:14.205
So, after the melee,
you confronted her?

40:17.194 --> 40:24.474
I just wanted to know
why she told him.

40:27.663 --> 40:33.198
So I took her shoulders
and I shook her.

40:35.030 --> 40:40.529
She said she wanted Cal
to feel sympathy for me.

40:40.529 --> 40:42.994
That if he understood
what I suffered,

40:42.994 --> 40:45.632
he'd have compassion.

40:48.596 --> 40:51.328
Instead of using Jimmy
to taunt me,

40:52.767 --> 40:54.369
to hurt me.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.675
So you hurt her.

40:58.512 --> 41:00.905
How long did you shake her for?

41:00.905 --> 41:04.466
Until her head hit the wall.

41:05.176 --> 41:10.294
And I saw her eyes
and she was...

41:12.180 --> 41:14.532
And so I dropped her.

41:23.939 --> 41:28.083
PREACHER PAID FOR GAY SEX

41:34.954 --> 41:38.667
Detective, the ME just called.

41:38.667 --> 41:40.937
You should get down there.

41:45.122 --> 41:47.096
Detective.

41:49.826 --> 41:52.616
He had your card in his coat.

42:08.223 --> 42:11.805
That's not my brother.
It's my coat, it's not my brother.

42:12.854 --> 42:14.361
I guess he sold it to somebody.

42:14.361 --> 42:18.023
It's OK, I gave it to him.
He can sell it if he wants to.

42:21.726 --> 42:24.201
Well, everybody needs money, right?

42:27.536 --> 42:29.253
Thanks.

42:30.050 --> 42:33.484
