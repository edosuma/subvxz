is not with his gender.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.041
Yeah-- oh.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.250
-Yeah.
-Okay.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.125
GREG:
Yeah. We're gonna send

08:36.208 --> 08:40.166
your paci away on a balloon
to the Paci Fairy,

08:40.250 --> 08:42.583
and because you are
such a big girl,

08:42.667 --> 08:46.291
<i>he </i>is gonna get you a present.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.959
A present?

08:48.041 --> 08:49.250
-Yeah.
-That's right. Yeah.

08:49.333 --> 08:52.083
But if you keep your paci,

08:52.166 --> 08:56.625
then the Paci Monster sneaks
into your room at night

08:56.709 --> 08:58.166
when you're sleeping,

08:58.250 --> 09:01.166
and he just eats you up
in one big bite.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.583
(whispers):
Jen, what the hell are you doing?

09:02.667 --> 09:04.291
Come on, "Paci Monster"?
Come on.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.875
I don't know, I felt like we
needed a bad guy or something.

09:06.959 --> 09:10.375
Okay. Paci Fairy, no monster.

09:10.458 --> 09:11.917
(clicks tongue)

09:12.000 --> 09:14.375
Okay, so...

09:14.458 --> 09:16.667
Here we go. All right?

09:16.750 --> 09:18.709
Now, everybody is here,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.959
so we're gonna send these off,

09:21.041 --> 09:23.166
and let it float away
to the Paci Fairy,

09:23.250 --> 09:26.083
and then he is gonna
bring you a big present.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.542
The Paci Fairy's a dude?

09:27.625 --> 09:29.000
Joanie, get your hat,
we're leaving.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.458
Stop.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.333
This is so something
you only do for the first kid.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.166
Oh, totally.

09:34.250 --> 09:37.333
Come on, Tyler's pacifier
got a blastoff to Paci Planet,

09:37.417 --> 09:39.250
while Samantha's got tossed
into the garbage disposal

09:39.333 --> 09:41.458
while I screamed at her, "Look
at what you made Mommy do!"

09:41.542 --> 09:42.667
Do you remember that, sweetie?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.083
Yeah, I remember feeling

09:44.166 --> 09:47.041
like it was my fault
but not knowing why.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.625
I don't even remember what
we did with Sophia's pacifier.

09:49.709 --> 09:52.166
I probably lost it or something.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.792
Okay, ready?
We're gonna count it off.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.000
-Five...
-Five...

09:58.083 --> 09:59.291
ALL:
Four...

09:59.375 --> 10:00.709
three...

10:00.792 --> 10:01.834
two...

10:01.917 --> 10:02.875
Wait, wait.

10:02.959 --> 10:04.000
What?

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
All done.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.667
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. Ready?

10:09.750 --> 10:12.333
One, two, three.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.750
-Bye-bye, paci!
-(cheering)

10:14.834 --> 10:16.500
-HEATHER: Good job, Lark.
-LARK: See you, sucker.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.083
-Come here, I'm so proud of you.
-Come here, sweetie. Oh.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.208
You're such a big girl.

10:20.291 --> 10:21.834
And now,

10:21.917 --> 10:23.458
no big scary Paci Monster's

10:23.542 --> 10:26.083
gonna come and eat
my Lark's face off.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.291
Oops. Look, right there.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.333
Oh, the power lines.

10:29.417 --> 10:30.500
-JEN: Oh, God.
-GREG: No.

10:30.583 --> 10:31.875
No, no, no, no,

10:31.959 --> 10:33.375
-no, no, no...
-No, no, no...

10:33.458 --> 10:35.041
-(electricity sparking)
-Oh!

10:39.125 --> 10:41.542
(whispering):
No Paci Monster, no Paci Monster.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.834
No Paci Monster.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.041
<i>Mommy!</i>

10:46.125 --> 10:47.959
Ugh, what have we done?

10:48.041 --> 10:49.834
'Cause I'm gonna
go out on a limb and say

10:49.917 --> 10:51.542
it's the wrong thing.

10:51.625 --> 10:55.333
We need a bigger crib.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.542
It wasn't me.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.458
I just took you off
the lawn mower.

11:39.542 --> 11:41.917
Sweetheart, why would
you do such a thing?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.166
I don't know.
I'm bored over here.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.542
But, dear, we have
a tennis ball.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.000
Sophia, our house
just burned down.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.959
We have a ton
of boxes to unpack.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.875
Why do we even need
so many boxes?

11:51.959 --> 11:54.291
Because we might be
living here for a year.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.417
Okay, so it's not a great time
for you to jack a lawn mower

11:56.500 --> 11:58.041
and take it for a joyride.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.834
I-I'll watch her, Heather,
you go unpack your boxes.

12:00.917 --> 12:01.917
You know, sometimes,
these kids

12:02.000 --> 12:03.625
need to be disciplined

12:03.709 --> 12:04.917
the old-fashioned way.

12:05.000 --> 12:05.959
HEATHER:
Oh.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.500
Here, go put this in my closet.

12:07.583 --> 12:10.375
I don't want to get it dirty.

12:10.458 --> 12:12.667
'Cause we're gonna
be doing some hard labor.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.667
N-No. Put that down.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.834
We're not here to play.
We're here to work.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.291
(groans)

12:20.375 --> 12:21.417
All right.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.709
Now, get up there.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.792
I'm not supposed to go
in the attic, you know.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.125
Well, why don't you channel

12:26.208 --> 12:27.917
some of that sass
into figuring out

12:28.000 --> 12:30.500
what critter is scratching
around up there?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.000
Is this even safe?

12:33.083 --> 12:35.000
No, but that's what
the rope is for.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.583
Fine. I'm going.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.542
But I better get some candy
when I'm done.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.667
Even coal miners

12:39.750 --> 12:42.166
get to have a beer
at the end of the day.

12:44.417 --> 12:45.750
Sophia?

12:45.834 --> 12:47.625
I baked some cookies.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.583
Come on down,
I'll give them to you.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.458
What the...?
(grunts)

12:55.542 --> 12:58.291
Mr. Pickle?

12:58.375 --> 13:00.291
I've been had.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.583
Sophia? Sophia?

13:03.667 --> 13:05.208
(grunts)

13:05.291 --> 13:06.709
Tim, have you seen Sophia?

13:06.792 --> 13:08.417
I thought you were watching her.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.083
I thought you were unpacking.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.208
I fell in the pool.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.291
In your swimming trunks?

13:14.375 --> 13:16.458
I was quite lucky.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.041
Oh, hey, Dad.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.000
-Hey.
-I fell in the pool.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.792
Uh, where's Sophia?

13:22.875 --> 13:26.333
Oh, we were playing
hide-and-seek, uh...

13:26.417 --> 13:27.458
Uh, Sophia?

13:27.542 --> 13:28.542
Pop-Pop gives up.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.041
Come on out, right now.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.542
She's not gonna learn
what hard work is

13:31.625 --> 13:34.041
if you let her just quit
in the middle of a game.

13:34.125 --> 13:36.458
Sophia, honey,
you stay hidden, okay?

13:36.542 --> 13:38.667
You make Pop-Pop look for you.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.458
Sophia? Sophia!

13:41.542 --> 13:42.667
Okay, Tank.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.291
This is Sophia's scent.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.625
Now, go find her, girl.

13:45.709 --> 13:47.917
Is she outside?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.583
Is that it?

13:50.542 --> 13:51.500
(barking)

13:51.583 --> 13:53.083
(gasps) My sweater.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.750
I've been looking
for that. (laughs)

13:54.834 --> 13:56.750
Well, then who's Tank chasing?

13:56.834 --> 13:58.500
A Subaru?

13:58.583 --> 14:00.583
What? Tank!

14:02.125 --> 14:03.250
Excuse me.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.917
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.625
Have you seen a little girl?

14:06.709 --> 14:09.542
Uh, she was in my attic,
but, uh, she got away.

14:09.625 --> 14:12.834
She must've squiggled out of
the rope I had tied around her.

14:12.917 --> 14:16.375
Come on, Gracie, let me show you
the other sidewalk.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.417
Did you lose Sophia, dear?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.333
No.

14:22.417 --> 14:26.291
Well, all right, yeah,
she... she duped me.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.291
Her-Her and that pickle
were working together.

14:29.375 --> 14:32.500
You know, sometimes kids
can be a lot like dogs.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.583
When they feel lost,
they usually go home.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.834
Wait, a-are we still
talking about Sophia?

14:38.917 --> 14:41.000
'Cause I lost Tank, too.

14:41.083 --> 14:44.625
We're talking
about our granddaughter.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.417
If you want to find her,

14:46.500 --> 14:48.542
think about what she just lost.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.500
Well, there you are.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.500
That wasn't a very nice trick
you played on Pop-Pop.

14:59.583 --> 15:04.291
In some families, my creativity
would be celebrated.

15:04.375 --> 15:05.667
Well, why are you doing it?

15:05.750 --> 15:08.041
I mean, you're usually
so well-behaved.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.667
Don't tell anybody,

15:09.750 --> 15:12.500
but you're kind of
my favorite grandkid.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.000
I know.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.917
You wrote it
on my birthday cake.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
So, what is it?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.125
You can talk to me.

15:18.208 --> 15:21.000
This is my home.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.959
I don't know how
to live anywhere else.

15:23.041 --> 15:25.041
Oh, honey.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.667
This is just a house.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.667
A home is where
your family is.

15:29.792 --> 15:32.709
And you're always gonna
have a home with me.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.875
Thanks, Pop-Pop.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.667
I already feel safer.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.291
Oh, my God!

15:41.375 --> 15:43.375
We'd better go.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.166
Yeah, let's get
out of here. (coughs)

15:48.834 --> 15:50.542
TIM:
<i>So, what do you think</i>

15:50.625 --> 15:52.208
Tyler's announcement is?

15:52.291 --> 15:53.583
Either Clementine's pregnant

15:53.667 --> 15:55.625
or they want us
to listen to a new song.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.291
God, I hope she's pregnant.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.000
Hi, everyone.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.125
Thank you for coming.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.625
So, after much consideration

16:01.709 --> 16:05.917
and a Twitter poll,
Clementine and I have decided

16:06.000 --> 16:08.333
that our marriage has come
to its natural conclusion.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.625
What? No.

16:10.709 --> 16:12.333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:12.417 --> 16:14.834
All marriages come
to a natural conclusion.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.583
Y-You stick it out.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.625
-It's okay, Mom. It's for the best.
-(groans)

16:18.709 --> 16:20.959
Can't you convince her
to take you back?

16:21.083 --> 16:23.333
No, it was my idea.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.959
If Tyler gets
to quit his marriage,

16:25.041 --> 16:26.583
can I quit tee-ball?

16:26.667 --> 16:28.458
I've been doing that
twice as long.

16:28.542 --> 16:31.083
I'm really sorry, honey.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.750
So strange.

16:32.834 --> 16:36.041
You always think you'll divorce
before your children.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.250
(softly):
Yeah.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.583
Oh, poor Tyler and Clementine.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.041
Oh.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.041
I-I didn't get
to say good-bye to her.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.250
I don't think
I ever said hello to her.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.917
I don't think we ever even
had a conversation.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.333
Oh, well.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.500
Hey, family.

16:53.625 --> 16:54.834
-Here.
-Thank you.

16:54.917 --> 16:55.875
Love you.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.000
-I love you.
-(giggles)

16:57.917 --> 16:59.375
You're a liar, Heather,

16:59.458 --> 17:01.291
the same damn liar
you've always been.

17:01.375 --> 17:03.792
(stammers) Hi.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.125
Hi. Wh-Wh-What's going on?

17:05.208 --> 17:08.083
You told us that you
were getting a divorce.

17:08.166 --> 17:11.208
Well, I mean, legally,
we have filed for divorce,

17:11.291 --> 17:13.000
but that doesn't mean
we can't still share

17:13.083 --> 17:15.208
a house or our music
or our cat.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.834
Yeah, we just got a cat.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.792
Probably wasn't
the best timing, though.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.250
Look, the point is,

17:20.333 --> 17:22.333
Tyler and I are still
gonna be best friends

17:22.417 --> 17:24.375
who just love
and support each other

17:24.458 --> 17:26.959
as we explore new
relationships.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.583
-We're calling it romantic unsyncing.
-Romantic unsyncing.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.500
Is it okay if
in the Christmas letter,

17:31.583 --> 17:33.709
if I just call it divorced?

17:33.792 --> 17:35.125
No, Joan.

17:35.208 --> 17:38.041
Oh, okay.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.500
I've enjoyed our little chat.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.542
CLEMENTINE:
<i>You know, when you first said</i>

17:41.625 --> 17:42.583
<i>that we should unsync,</i>

17:42.667 --> 17:44.041
I wasn't so sure,

17:44.125 --> 17:46.125
but it was a great idea.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.375
We don't need labels
to define our relationship.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.083
Which reminds me, I should
define what we are online.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.125
Me, too.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.083
Okay.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.166
Single.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.125
Me, too. Single.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.792
(cell phone chiming)

18:05.834 --> 18:08.834
Oh. Mine must be broken.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.375
Can we talk?

18:12.458 --> 18:13.625
TIM:
Hey, guys.

18:13.709 --> 18:16.041
Listen, we were just thi...
Oh!

18:16.125 --> 18:18.166
-Honey.
-What, did this house get smaller?!

18:18.250 --> 18:21.250
-Uh, we had to make room for the cat.
-(hisses)

18:21.333 --> 18:22.291
-Gah!
-Ow!

18:22.375 --> 18:24.667
-Oh, God.
-Oh, geez, honey, sorry.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.417
You're standing
in his litter box.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.667
Oh, sorry.

18:27.750 --> 18:28.917
Will you just cut it out, Tim?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.500
I'm...

18:30.583 --> 18:31.834
HEATHER:
Okay.

18:31.917 --> 18:35.166
Before you guys
make this permanent

18:35.250 --> 18:36.792
life-altering decision,

18:36.875 --> 18:38.375
could we talk about

18:38.458 --> 18:40.166
what it is that went wrong
in your marriage?

18:40.250 --> 18:43.125
We just don't really have
anything to talk about

18:43.208 --> 18:46.041
-unless we watch
a TV show together.
-Yeah.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.542
Yeah, and then
we'd only have sex, like,

18:47.625 --> 18:50.125
five times a week.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.291
Huh.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.917
Only in the bed.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.208
HEATHER:
What you're talking about,

18:54.291 --> 18:56.083
that's marriage.

18:56.166 --> 18:58.166
-Yeah. It's-it's a really
good one, actually.
-Yes.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.041
See, I knew you guys
wouldn't understand.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.166
Relationships have evolved

19:01.250 --> 19:03.667
way beyond your
generation's limited,

19:03.750 --> 19:05.250
conventional view of love.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.250
-Is he too old to spank?
-Honey...

19:07.333 --> 19:08.542
Oh, you know, I have
to go get ready

19:08.625 --> 19:09.875
or I'm gonna be
late for my date.

we're doing this.

Hey, do you want me
to drop you off?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.250
Sure.

Thanks.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.959
Modern relationships
don't have to be binary.

Let that wash over you.

19:24.333 --> 19:25.667

he's getting spanked.
