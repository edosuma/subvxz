00:02.536 --> 00:03.904
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:04.004 --> 00:06.274
People don't show up
at shooting ranges on a whim.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.376
Can I ask you what happened?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.213
Mom!
Robyn!

00:12.313 --> 00:13.814
Mom!
No!

00:13.914 --> 00:16.717
If you want to get better,
listen to Manny. He's the truth.

00:16.817 --> 00:21.389
No business is conducted
near my gym ever.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.557
This ain't over, old man.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.594
Manny!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.430
Did you see the shooter?
No.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.433
I did get into it...
with a guy at the gym.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.902
<i>Give me a name.</i>

00:35.002 --> 00:36.970
<i>Lo-Lo.</i>

00:41.942 --> 00:43.211
I just...

00:45.613 --> 00:47.515
But, uh...
Oh, my God.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.817
That is the most fun
I have had in ages.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.885
I'm so glad you finally
came out with us, Angie.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.054
Oh, me, too.
It's just been so hard

00:54.155 --> 00:56.090
to get out these days,
with the kid and all.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.892
Another reason why I'm happy
to keep singling and mingling.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.828
Okay?

01:00.928 --> 01:03.131
Oh, God, I...
I need to get home.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.465
Oh, what?
Oh.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.334
Come grab a bite
with us.
No, no, no.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.401
Rain check, okay?

01:07.501 --> 01:08.902
Mwah.
Mwah.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.538
Do you want us to walk you
to your train, Angie?

01:10.638 --> 01:12.406
No, no, no, it's just
a couple blocks away.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.542
Mwah. Love you guys. Bye.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.839
Don't hurt me!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.408
Please!
Shut up! Come here!

01:53.647 --> 01:56.717
Morning.
Morning.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.553
Have a wonderful day all.
I will see you all tonight.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.722
Where are you off to?

02:01.822 --> 02:04.425
My weekly massage with Angie.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.527
Oh! Can't take care
of everybody else

02:06.627 --> 02:07.961
if you don't take care
of yourself.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.264
Hey, self-care
is self-love.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.865
True that.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.834
How is Angie anyway? She still
working out of her house?

02:13.934 --> 02:16.270
No, she's working
full-time out of a spa now.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.971
Oh, come on,

02:18.071 --> 02:19.373
cucumber water!

02:20.241 --> 02:23.877
Well, um, just go easy
on the eucalyptus oil.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.879
My eyes are still burning
from the last time.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.582
Yeah, well, you're gonna have
to deal with it because I am

02:28.682 --> 02:29.750
getting the works today.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.519
Go pamper yourself, Auntie.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.322
You deserve it.
You got that right.

02:37.191 --> 02:40.594
Hey, what you doing today? You
got time to hang with your mom?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.596
I'm sorry.
Uh, Vera and I are actually

02:42.696 --> 02:44.498
gonna go thrifting
after school, so...

02:44.598 --> 02:46.500
Oh, that's a shame...

02:46.600 --> 02:48.469
because I haven't forgotten
my promise

02:48.569 --> 02:50.137
to help train you, and I thought

02:50.238 --> 02:52.640
today might be
a great day to do...
You know what?

02:52.740 --> 02:55.576
I mean, I'm sure
Vera won't mind rescheduling.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.379
Well, in that case, meet me at
Meyers and Linden after school.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.113
So, what are we working on?

03:00.214 --> 03:02.216
Strike combos? Takedowns?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.952
You'll see.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.357
Hey, Vi.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.459
So, how was your week?

03:11.559 --> 03:12.993
It was good.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.928
I think I might be
getting through to my students.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.498
One of 'em actually paid me
a compliment.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.833
It was well-deserved, I'm sure.
How about you?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.536
Well, Craig turned eight
this week.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.137
Eight?
Mm-hmm.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.706
No.
Yes.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.140
Let me see that.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.143
Oh, how is the cutie doing?

03:30.244 --> 03:32.112
He is growing like a weed!

03:32.212 --> 03:34.081
I know.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.550
Okay, well, I think
the room is almost ready.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.287
And we going deep tissue
with eucalyptus today?

03:39.387 --> 03:42.423
Yes. The more, the better.

03:42.523 --> 03:47.027
Hey, what happened there?
You all right?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.663
The-the porch was wet
after the rain a few nights ago,

03:49.763 --> 03:52.199
and I slipped,
but really, it's nothing.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.468
May I?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.570
Angie,

03:56.670 --> 03:59.340
you've got to get
this looked at.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.742
Yeah, I-I will. No.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.512
Today.
My schedule is packed.
I can't just leave.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.580
I'm sure your clients will
understand. I'll take you. No.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.248
Vi, please. Thank you.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.119
Ah, there's my princess.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.987
Doug.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.257
What are you doing here?
Well, can't a guy bring

04:17.358 --> 04:19.293
his beautiful wife
her favorite food for lunch?

04:19.393 --> 04:20.961
Oh.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.297
That's so sweet
of you, Doug. Thank you.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.732
Uh, you remember Vi,

04:24.832 --> 04:27.301
long-time client?
Viola Marsette.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.036
Yeah. Yeah, hi.

04:29.136 --> 04:32.873
I was just trying to convince
your wife to go see a doctor.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.842
Really?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.044
Why?

04:37.144 --> 04:40.348
Angie, show him.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.283
Mm.
Oh, honey,

04:43.384 --> 04:44.618
I had no idea.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.019
Yeah, guys, really,
it's-it's okay.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.455
I'm-I'm sorry.
Viola's right.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.722
Now go tell
your manager.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.957
I'm taking you
to the doctor right now.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.759
That's all there is to it.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.294
Okay.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.401
<i>Hey, Aunt Vi.</i>

05:00.501 --> 05:04.137
How was the massage? Should I
open up all the windows?

05:04.237 --> 05:07.207
I never got that far. Angie had
to leave to go to the doctor.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.509
Oh, no.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.877
She okay?

05:09.977 --> 05:13.481
Her arm was badly bruised,
and given

05:13.581 --> 05:14.882
how swollen it was,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.585
I'd say
it might even be broken.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.919
But you know what's odd?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.454
Her husband stopped by
with lunch,

05:20.554 --> 05:22.289
and he claimed he didn't know
anything about it.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.559
Any reason she would hide
an injury from her husband?

05:25.659 --> 05:26.927
Not that I know of, but...

05:27.027 --> 05:28.429
You think
there's something else

05:28.529 --> 05:29.830
going on?

05:29.930 --> 05:32.199
I don't know.
Doug seemed genuinely concerned.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.802
But Angie was so weird
around him.

05:34.902 --> 05:38.639
She... she was almost--
I don't know-- scared.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.674
You suspect
there's abuse involved?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.510
I don't know.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.912
I'm probably just overreacting.
Or maybe you're not.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.948
You have good instincts,
Aunt Vi. You should trust them.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.284
Okay, so what do I do?

05:51.385 --> 05:53.687
Call Harry, ask him
to look into the husband.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.689
Abusers don't turn violent overnight.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.725
Maybe there's a history.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.827
Okay, Douglas Novack
married Angie Martin

05:59.927 --> 06:01.429
in San Francisco in 2013,

06:01.529 --> 06:03.196
Works for a

06:03.296 --> 06:04.598
medical instruments firm.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.966
He moved to New York
two years ago for the job.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.602
By all accounts,
he's a valued employee.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.170
You know, works hard,
recently promoted.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.171
What about his past?

06:11.271 --> 06:13.173
Any violent behavior, arrests,

06:13.273 --> 06:14.274
restraining orders?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.409
Nothing here,
but sometimes

06:15.509 --> 06:16.910
records like that are sealed.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.112
Or if he abused someone
who didn't press charges,

06:19.212 --> 06:20.948
then, there would be no record
of it at all.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.616
Yeah, I mean, I'll keep digging,

06:22.716 --> 06:26.153
uh, but the picture I'm getting
is the exact opposite.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.955
What do you mean?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.957
He, uh, volunteers
for several non-profits,

06:30.057 --> 06:31.659
he coaches his kid's
soccer team,

06:31.759 --> 06:35.128
he organizes father-son camping
weekends. I mean, the guy is

06:35.228 --> 06:36.730
one puppy-adoption drive away

06:36.830 --> 06:38.131
from being voted
Father of the Year.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.569
Or he's overcompensating
for bad behavior.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.737
I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.939
He sounds like
a really great guy.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.374
No.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.143
You know who else seemed
like a great guy?

06:50.243 --> 06:52.880
This doctor, a close friend of
mine from high school married--

06:52.980 --> 06:55.148
Tracy Rivera.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.751
We were all
so thrilled for her,

06:57.851 --> 06:59.186
but then, I started
noticing bruises.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.188
And then, she wouldn't
come out with us.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.390
And then, she stopped
returning my calls.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.258
And then, her number changed.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.260
By the time I got it together
to go over there

07:07.360 --> 07:10.430
and ask her about it,
she was gone.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.400
Moved away months ago,
her neighbor said.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.836
Once in a while,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.805
I check the obituaries.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.108
But, no.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.812
She just disappeared.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.847
Oh, sorry. I didn't know
about any of that.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.381
It happened before I met you.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.184
I just wish

07:31.284 --> 07:33.053
I'd done something sooner.
Well, look.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.788
I-I-I'm gonna keep looking.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.925
If there's anything in
this guy's past, I'll find it.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.459
Thanks, Harry.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.861
Yeah.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.005
Hey!

07:53.040 --> 07:56.309
Where did you come from?

07:56.409 --> 07:58.111
I've been watching you
for the last ten minutes.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.514
You just
didn't see me. Whoops.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.415
Yeah. You have to be

08:02.516 --> 08:06.053
hyper-aware of your surroundings
at all times.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.455
And that's what today's
training is gonna be about.

08:08.556 --> 08:12.960
Situational awareness--
cornerstone of self-defense.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.996
Well, you can start by
retiring this for the day.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.345
Jackson, thanks
for meeting me.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.548
No problem.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.117
What you wanted
to talk with me about?
Lo-Lo.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.452
Man, I don't know any Lo-Lo.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.889
Really? You don't know
the guy who was

08:41.989 --> 08:43.223
making you deliver his packages

08:43.323 --> 08:44.725
before Manny got him
off your back?

08:44.825 --> 08:47.027
What about him?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.328
I'm trying to find him.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.763
Seems he's a hard man
to track down.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.699
Yeah, I don't mess
with him anymore.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.233
Come on.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.735
You worked for him.
You must know where he hangs,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.103
where he operates out of.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.838
I was a delivery boy.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.239
Are you serious?

08:59.339 --> 09:01.041
This lowlife tried
to kill Manny,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.610
the one person
who believes in your future,

09:02.710 --> 09:03.944
and you're protecting him?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.979
Look, man, straight up?

09:06.079 --> 09:07.648
I'm scared, all right?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.116
I love Manny,
but everybody knows

09:09.216 --> 09:11.051
Lo-Lo shot him,
and I ain't trying to be next.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.721
That's exactly why I need
to find him so that you

09:13.821 --> 09:15.122
and everybody else
in the neighborhood don't have

09:15.222 --> 09:16.489
to walk around in fear.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.625
I wasn't lying when I said

09:17.725 --> 09:18.726
I don't know where to find him.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.027
Dude's always
moving around.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.494
Any info will help.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.933
I overheard him once

09:26.033 --> 09:27.400
talking about
some of his spots.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.136
Some-some girl's house
in Queens,

09:29.236 --> 09:32.572
an underpass in a park he likes
to use, and, um, his aunt

09:32.673 --> 09:33.941
got a spot in Bushwick.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.977
Details. Put it all down for me.

09:41.815 --> 09:42.883
Hi.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.317
Vi. What are you doing here?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.053
I hope I'm not overstepping.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.488
I just thought I'd...
I'd check on you. Oh.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.057
That's so nice of you.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.225
Thank you. I'm fine.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.894
So what did the doctor say?

09:53.994 --> 09:55.462
Just like I thought--
a-a bruise,

09:55.562 --> 09:58.231
and he gave me some Tylenol
and sent me home.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.033
Really?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.369
With all that swelling?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.838
Which doctor did you go to?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.408
Look, Vi,
I appreciate your concern,

10:08.508 --> 10:12.813
I-I really do, but showing up
like this, interrogating me--

10:12.913 --> 10:14.481
it's too much.
I don't mean

10:14.581 --> 10:16.549
to pry really, but...

10:16.650 --> 10:18.551
could I just come in
for a minute to talk?

10:18.652 --> 10:21.088
No. I-I told you
I slipped in the driveway.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.657
I'm fine. Just leave it alone.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.826
Yes, but...

10:26.593 --> 10:29.629
...you said
you slipped on your porch.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.249
Detective Dante.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.051
Come on in.
How are you settling in,
Captain?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.853
Adjustment's not so bad.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.922
You know, turns out we're
enforcing the same laws here

10:55.022 --> 10:56.456
as we did at my last gig.

10:56.556 --> 10:57.825
Glad to hear it.
If there's anything you need

10:57.925 --> 10:59.392
to help with the transition,

10:59.492 --> 11:00.794
don't hesitate to ask.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.096
Actually, you can answer
something for me.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.799
How has this precinct
gone so long

11:05.899 --> 11:07.334
without a commanding officer?

11:07.434 --> 11:08.969
I'm not sure.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.538
Fortunately, we don't have
to worry about that anymore.

11:11.638 --> 11:15.642
Your reputation for charm
is well-earned, I see.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.779
But not something
I'm susceptible to.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.781
Yes, ma'am.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.482
Mm.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.351
Excuse me, Captain. Dante,

11:24.451 --> 11:26.253
there's a woman out front
here to see you.
Thanks, Eva.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.755
Tell the desk sergeant
to bring her back.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.056
I'll be right there.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.193
Looks like
we both got work to do.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.895
Oh, and just so you know,

11:34.995 --> 11:38.298
I'll be conducting a full
evaluation of the department.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.868
Some changes on the horizon?

11:40.968 --> 11:43.570
Not if everything is running
at max efficiency.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.706
That's all, Detective.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.809
Yes, ma'am.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.114
Ms. Marsette. Detective.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.251
Have a seat.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.555
Thank you for taking
the time to see me.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.924
Robyn told me a little about

12:04.024 --> 12:05.492
what's going on
with your friend Angie.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.160
Did she tell you
that her husband hurt her?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.162
Oh, no, she'd never
admit that, but

12:09.262 --> 12:12.632
her injuries and her behavior
show all the signs

12:12.732 --> 12:13.967
of an abusive relationship.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.037
Not surprising,
Angie's protecting her abuser.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.339
I have way too much experience
with this.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.243
We get over 600
domestic violence calls a day.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.847
Is there anything
that you can do to help her?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.215
Unfortunately,
the way it works,

12:28.315 --> 12:31.118
the burden is on Angie
to press charges.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.653
She won't talk to the cops.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.422
Then I'm afraid
our hands are tied.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.024
If you want to help your friend,

12:37.124 --> 12:39.259
you have to get her
to talk to us.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.298
Here you go.
All right, thank you.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.834
Thanks.

12:46.934 --> 12:51.004
Whoa. Never sit with
your back to the room.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.609
All right.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.281
Now, the first thing I do when
I walk into a space like this,

13:01.381 --> 13:02.682
you identify your exits.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.286
Okay. There.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.755
And... there. Good.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.859
Then you watch and listen
with your entire body.

13:14.394 --> 13:18.131
For instance, that woman there--
what's her story?

13:18.231 --> 13:21.401
Uh, I'm-I'm not
really sure.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.171
Well, look
at her non-verbal cues.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.739
What's she saying?

13:26.840 --> 13:30.643
She looks anxious,
uncomfortable, like

13:30.743 --> 13:34.915
she's waiting to meet someone
that she's not excited to see.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.651
An ex?
Could be, but look at the way

13:38.751 --> 13:42.589
she's dressed. She wants to
impress, but it's not romantic.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.957
Her outfit is expensive,

13:44.057 --> 13:46.659
but look just behind the collar.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.366
The price tag?
She wants to give off
an air of wealth.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.102
My guess would be

13:55.202 --> 13:58.771
an old friend
with a new zip code.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.978
Emily, hi.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.179
Hi.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.851
See, sometimes
it's about what <i>doesn't</i> belong.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.288
And listen, even if you can't
figure it out right away,

14:15.388 --> 14:16.623
always trust your gut.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.791
If it's telling you
that something is off,

14:18.892 --> 14:20.293
it probably is.

14:20.393 --> 14:24.297
Thank you for making the time
to train me.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.200
Really means a lot.

14:28.235 --> 14:32.372
I will always make time for you,
no matter what.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.710
Angie, I know you're in there.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.647
Angie?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.815
Please open the door.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.152
What do you want?
I said I'm fine.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.287
There's something I need to
tell you, something important.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.356
I don't know how
to make this any clearer,

14:49.456 --> 14:50.958
but I do not need you
to worry about me.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.160
This isn't about you.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.128
It's about me.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.499
His name was Charles.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.902
I met him when I was
a young art student

15:03.003 --> 15:04.704
traveling through Europe.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.340
He was handsome, smart,

15:07.440 --> 15:11.278
thought I was the most beautiful
woman in the world. Oh.

15:11.378 --> 15:15.148
I was so hooked, I was ready
to follow him anywhere.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.685
And then, one night,

15:18.785 --> 15:21.654
a lovers' spat...

15:21.754 --> 15:23.523
turned into

15:23.623 --> 15:25.558
a night of terror

15:25.658 --> 15:28.061
that I will never forget.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.901
He was ashamed, and...

15:35.002 --> 15:37.770
begged for my forgiveness.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.174
Swore up and down that...

15:42.942 --> 15:45.412
...that it would
never happen again.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.516
And it didn't
because I'd made up my mind

15:49.616 --> 15:54.187
the first time he hit me
would be the last.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.491
And so you left him?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.293
Yes.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.930
Took all of my strength.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.936
Strength
I didn't even think I had.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.405
I just want to help you

16:12.505 --> 16:14.274
the way...

16:14.374 --> 16:17.244
the way I wish
someone would have helped me.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.915
Okay.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.887
Doug hits me sometimes.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.523
But it's not his fault.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.159
You know, he's...

16:32.259 --> 16:35.462
He gets so stressed out by work,
and then...

16:35.562 --> 16:37.297
And then, on the weekends,
he's trying to be

16:37.397 --> 16:40.833
a good dad to Craig, and-and
he's got his community work,

16:40.933 --> 16:42.902
um, to keep our
groundwater safe.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.939
And you have no idea how much
toxic waste is disposed of...

16:47.040 --> 16:49.976
Angie, none of these things
are an excuse for him

16:50.077 --> 16:51.778
putting his hands on you.
I know.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.681
He's a good man, though.
He's just had a bad childhood.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.783
What about your own boy
and what this is doing

16:56.883 --> 16:58.118
to sweet little Craig?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.752
Doug has never laid a hand
on Craig.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.421
Not yet,
and even if he never does,

17:01.521 --> 17:06.093
what is witnessing this violence
doing to your boy?

17:06.193 --> 17:10.630
What kind of man is Doug
teaching Craig to become?

17:10.730 --> 17:12.765
Craig is never in the room
when Doug gets violent.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.334
I would never allow that.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.802
Children are much smarter
than you think. Viola,

17:15.902 --> 17:18.271
I cannot leave Doug.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.275
I cannot take Craig away
from his father.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.277
He loves that man,
he worships him.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.979
It would break
both of their hearts.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.255
You have my number.

17:35.355 --> 17:38.691
This is my address
in case things get really bad

17:38.791 --> 17:41.928
and you need a safe place
to stay.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.431
I won't,
but thank you for the offer.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.606
Ah, big Lo-Lo.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.742
What up, man?
What up?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.995
Where's Lo-Lo?
Right here.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.000
What you want now?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.305
What else he got?

18:26.173 --> 18:28.107
Five-O.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.445
Oh, Detective Marcus Dante.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.447
Oh, this about
that washed-up fighter, right?

18:34.547 --> 18:35.882
His name is Manny.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.850
Yeah. Heard what
happened to him.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.387
Damn shame.
Like you had nothing
to do with that.

18:40.487 --> 18:44.090
Well, you got proof?
'Cause if you do, then go ahead.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.361
That's what I thought.
What should we do with him?

18:48.461 --> 18:51.130
Put him back on the street.

18:51.231 --> 18:55.668
I'll hang onto this badge,
though, and this, too.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.405
Five-O! Freeze!

19:00.072 --> 19:02.242
Let's go, fool.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.346
<i>Hello, Harry.</i>

19:06.446 --> 19:08.448
I'm sorry to say
it's exactly as we feared.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.318
Angie admitted to being abused,
and she refuses to leave him.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.353
Oh, well, maybe
this'll change her mind.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.955
Doug Novack may not have
a dark past, but

19:16.055 --> 19:17.724
Felix White sure does.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.459
He changed his name?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.661
Yeah, and it's pretty clear why.
His first wife died

19:21.761 --> 19:24.231
suddenly when she fell down the
stairs and she broke her neck.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.498
Oh, my God. He pushed her?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.066
It was ruled an accident,

19:27.166 --> 19:28.668
but the coroner did
find evidence

19:28.768 --> 19:30.069
of healed arm fractures.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.404
There's no way
Angie knows about this,

19:31.504 --> 19:32.939
but she needs to immediately.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.407
Thank you both.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.389
Well, something smells

19:49.489 --> 19:51.324
even better than these flowers.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.025
Oh.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.297
Hey, I'm, uh...
I'm sorry about your arm.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.266
You know that, right?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.701
Of course I do.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.908
Are you okay?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.611
Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, thank you

20:11.711 --> 20:14.481
for these flowers.
So beautiful.

20:16.182 --> 20:19.051
Why does the meat look funny?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.488
Oh, I'm...

20:21.588 --> 20:24.190
I just got ground turkey instead
of beef. There was a sale,

20:24.291 --> 20:25.458
so I thought I'd just...
You know

20:25.558 --> 20:27.360
we can afford
the real beef, Ange.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.762
You think
I can't provide for you?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.364
No. No.
For this family?

20:31.464 --> 20:34.334
That is not what I meant.
Now, now
you've ruined the sauce.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.603
You know I hate
ground turkey.
Okay. I'm-I'm sorry.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.571
You-You've never complained
when I served it before.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.307
Are you calling me a liar?
No, baby.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.345
Doug, I said

20:45.445 --> 20:47.046
I'm sorry.
Damn right you're sorry.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.586
Craig, go to your room!

20:53.686 --> 20:54.921
Stop it!

20:55.021 --> 20:55.988
Stop it!
No!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.123
Stop it!

20:57.223 --> 20:59.292
No! No!

20:59.392 --> 21:01.428
No, baby.

21:01.528 --> 21:04.030
Craig. Craig.
Come here. Come here.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.432
No.
No, baby. Come here.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.567
You see what you made me do?!

21:07.667 --> 21:10.603
This is your fault! Your fault!

21:21.448 --> 21:23.282
Angie!

21:23.383 --> 21:25.385
Come in, come in.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.655
Are you all right?

21:28.755 --> 21:31.358
I have been calling you
since last night.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.727
Oh, my God.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.630
We've got to get you

21:37.730 --> 21:39.265
to a doctor.
I don't need a doctor.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.233
I need a way out.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.904
I've got to leave Doug
if I want to keep Craig safe.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.239
I see that now.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.777
I found a safe place
for both you and Craig.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.346
But we've got to go
to the police first.

21:53.446 --> 21:56.383
I know a very nice detective
who can take your statement.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.185
Now? I-I have to pick up
Craig from school soon.

21:59.285 --> 22:03.089
All right, you go get Craig.
I'll meet you at the school,

22:03.189 --> 22:05.324
and we can go
to the precinct from there.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.793
Okay.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.164
Thank you.

22:16.803 --> 22:17.870
Detective Dante.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.406
Back so soon.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.073
I'm beginning to think

22:21.173 --> 22:22.409
your caseload is too light.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.344
Actually, Captain,
I need to make a report.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.381
Is it this department's policy
to make verbal reports instead

22:28.481 --> 22:31.183
of utilizing the oh-so-many
designated forms?

22:31.283 --> 22:33.085
This one is
of a sensitive nature.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.422
Go on.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.790
While in pursuit of a suspect,

22:37.890 --> 22:40.560
he and his crew got the drop
on me, and...

22:40.660 --> 22:42.629
And?

22:42.729 --> 22:46.032
They relieved me
of my shield and weapon.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.402
You were trying
to apprehend the suspect?

22:50.603 --> 22:52.839
Where was your backup?
I was off-duty.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.909
What was the name
of the suspect?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.811
Lonnie Lofton,
street name "Lo-Lo."

22:58.911 --> 23:00.680
Why is that name ringing a bell?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.849
Oh, here it is.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.485
A complaint from
Detective Hutchens

23:05.585 --> 23:08.888
about your unwanted
involvement in his case.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.257
His case involved this Lo-Lo?
Yes, Captain, but...

23:11.357 --> 23:13.760
But you disregarded
his request?
If I may, Captain.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.496
The detective who contacted me
hasn't been making this case

23:16.596 --> 23:18.264
the priority it needs to be.
But you can,

23:18.364 --> 23:20.633
because you have
nothing else going on?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.702
The victim of the shooting
is a friend of mine.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.637
Isn't that a major reason
for you <i>not</i> to get involved

23:24.737 --> 23:27.406
in this case?
Respectfully, Captain,
Lo-Lo has been

23:27.507 --> 23:28.775
slinging dope to kids,

23:28.875 --> 23:30.510
and no one's been making a move
to stop him.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.813
Somebody's got to bring him in.
Agreed. But it won't be you.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.015
You are too close
to this, Detective.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.917
I mean, your poor judgment has
demonstrated as much.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.953
But, Captain...
Stay away from this Lo-Lo guy.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.922
Understand?

23:43.022 --> 23:45.191
You still have
your backup piece?

23:45.291 --> 23:47.527
Or did he take that, too?
I still have it.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.962
File the necessary paperwork
on the one they took.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.498
Yes, Captain.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.036
Such a nice day out.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.871
Enjoy it. Take it all in.

23:58.971 --> 24:02.141
The sights, the sounds,
the smells.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.243
Now tell me
one big difference

24:04.343 --> 24:07.279
in situational awareness
between here

24:07.379 --> 24:08.447
and that café.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.650
Out here, you can't sit

24:10.750 --> 24:12.151
with your back to the wall.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.053
That's right. See, inside,

24:14.153 --> 24:16.556
you could limit the scope
of your surroundings

24:16.656 --> 24:18.558
to a 180-degree field of vision.

24:18.658 --> 24:22.595
But when you're on the move,
that 180 turns into a full 360.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.597
That's a lot of ground to cover.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.500
It is, and since you don't have
eyes in the back of your head,

24:27.600 --> 24:28.901
how do you do it?

24:29.836 --> 24:31.871
Well, sights, sounds, smells.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.706
You use your other senses.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.108
Yeah, especially
your hearing.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.577
Listen for changes.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.812
Every environment
has its own rhythm.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.781
Sounds that repeat.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.215
You hear it?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.987
Hmm. Footsteps.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.257
Birds chirping.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.695
The dog barking.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.897
That's right.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.867
Now, if that beat changes,

25:00.967 --> 25:02.301
that means something
new is happening,

25:02.401 --> 25:05.237
and you have a split-second
to evaluate

25:05.337 --> 25:07.974
whether that change
signifies a threat.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.776
That's a lot to take in.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.310
It is.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.213
And you have to decipher
all that without losing sight

25:14.313 --> 25:16.148
of what's right in front of you.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.750
For example,
that guy.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.952
The big one?
Mm-hmm.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.520
He looks angry.
Yeah, well,

25:21.621 --> 25:23.489
you don't know whether he's
having a bad day, or whether

25:23.590 --> 25:24.824
he has ill intentions,
and you don't know

25:24.924 --> 25:26.192
what's under his jacket.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.461
So I stay on guard
until after he passes.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.397
What if he doesn't let you pass?
What if he pulls a gun on you

25:31.497 --> 25:33.365
and tries to force you
into a car?

25:33.465 --> 25:35.267
Drop and attack from the ground?
Grab his wrist

25:35.367 --> 25:38.070
and use his momentum
against him? Wait, I know. Um,

25:38.170 --> 25:39.471
attack his soft spots:
eyes, neck, groin.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.208
No, baby girl.

25:42.308 --> 25:43.209
You run!

25:43.309 --> 25:46.378
As far and as fast as you can!

25:46.478 --> 25:48.014
Really?

25:48.114 --> 25:52.551
That guy's got 12 inches
and 150 pounds on you.

25:52.652 --> 25:56.756
Sometimes flight is your
best weapon of self-defense.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.859
Know when to use it.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.194
I guess I have a lot to learn.

26:10.502 --> 26:13.572
Detective Dante, you didn't have
to meet me down here, you know.

26:13.673 --> 26:17.076
I figured this might be a better
place to take Angie's statement.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.678
The precinct can be intimidating.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.013
I've seen more than one
abuse victim change their mind

26:21.113 --> 26:22.815
at the last minute.
Um, this way.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.951
Bye. Don't forget to
get your permission slip signed.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.886
I will.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.822
Oh, can I help you?
Hi. I'm Viola Marsette.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.223
This is Detective Dante.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.360
We're here to see
Craig Novack's mother Angie.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.362
I'm afraid she's not here yet.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.199
That's strange. She left to pick
up Craig over 30 minutes ago.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.334
Is she often late
to pick up her son?

26:42.434 --> 26:46.138
Never. The odd thing is, I saw
her waiting outside earlier.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.140
It was about 2:45.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.142
And when the bell rang,
and I brought the kids out,

26:50.242 --> 26:51.510
she wasn't there.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.379
<i>All right,
I've got decent coverage</i>

26:53.479 --> 26:55.748
of the school's front
and side entrances.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.184
Aunt Vi told me what's going on.
We're on with her and Dante now.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.319
Oh, Robyn,
I'm so glad you're there.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.821
Of course.
All right.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.089
Think I got her.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.590
Dante, I'm sending you
the feed right now.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.926
Teacher was right.
She was standing

27:07.026 --> 27:08.928
right outside the school
before dismissal.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.030
So where did she go?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.834
Wait. Who is that?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.202
Is that him?

27:19.071 --> 27:20.239
That's Angie's husband.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.274
I'll put out a BOLO.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.076
We got to find her fast.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.312
Doug, do not do this!

27:26.412 --> 27:28.614
No! No!
You thought I wouldn't
find out, huh?

27:28.715 --> 27:30.783
I'm not gonna leave.
You think I'm stupid? Hmm?

27:30.883 --> 27:34.754
Your toothbrush was gone,
Craig's medications.
No. No!

27:34.854 --> 27:38.057
No! No! No!

27:38.157 --> 27:39.892
You want to leave, huh?
You want out?

27:39.992 --> 27:41.828
You want out?!
Please!

27:41.928 --> 27:44.764
This is out.
No!

27:51.003 --> 27:53.139
Aunt Vi.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.506
Oh.
Hey.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.608
Any news on Angie?
Not yet.

27:56.709 --> 27:57.676
Well, don't worry.
We'll find her.

27:57.777 --> 27:58.978
What if we don't?

27:59.078 --> 28:01.313
Stay positive.
We'll find her.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.183
Okay, thanks. Just post
someone there in case they show.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.853
Uni at Doug and Angie's place
says there's no one inside.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.855
Doug's car is still
in the driveway.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.256
Neighbor says
it's been there all day.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.423
So where did he take her?

28:14.093 --> 28:15.928
Find something, Harry?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.997
Yeah, we got a ping
from Angie's cell

28:18.097 --> 28:20.366
in Jersey, near East Brunswick,
and it looks like her phone

28:20.466 --> 28:22.468
went dead a few minutes later.
Jersey already?

28:22.568 --> 28:24.270
They're definitely
traveling by car.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.105
But Doug's car's
been home all day.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.007
Harry, does he have any access
to a company car?

28:28.107 --> 28:29.475
No, I already checked.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.143
No cars have been removed
from his workplace.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.345
Wait a minute.
Angie said that Doug volunteers

28:33.445 --> 28:34.613
someplace on the weekend.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.449
A program
that cleans up toxic waste.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.517
Harry, can you get into

28:38.617 --> 28:40.052
Doug's cell phone records?

28:40.152 --> 28:43.355
Hold on. Okay, uh,
multiple outgoing calls,

28:43.455 --> 28:44.857
uh, made to someplace called
"Clean Ground, Clean Water."

28:44.957 --> 28:46.692
Send me the number.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.794
I'll make the call.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.661
On its way.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.097
Robyn, I'm scared.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.432
What if she's...?

28:53.532 --> 28:55.534
What if we're too late?

28:55.634 --> 28:58.737
Now, in my experience, with guys
like this, it's about power.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.773
They don't just kill.

29:00.873 --> 29:03.709
They want
to make their victims suffer.

29:03.810 --> 29:06.145
Now, as horrible
as that sounds,

29:06.245 --> 29:09.315
it gives me hope
that she's still alive.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.417
Okay.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.185
I spoke to the office manager.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.421
One of their service trucks
is missing.

29:15.521 --> 29:18.324
He says there's also a 55-gallon
oil drum missing, as well.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.226
Oh, no.
Mel, Harry,

29:20.326 --> 29:21.660
did you hear that?
Yeah, loud and clear.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.029
All right.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.664
Ping from her cell came
from East Brunswick.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.500
There!

29:28.600 --> 29:29.535
A chemical disposal plant

29:29.635 --> 29:31.003
a few exits down the turnpike.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.771
Let's move.
We'll meet you there.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.550
Stand back.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.454
If she's in one of these drums,
she's gonna run out of air.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.289
Mel, Dante, you search
over there. Harry and I

29:50.389 --> 29:52.658
will search over here.
Angie?
Angie?

29:52.758 --> 29:53.725
Angie?

29:53.826 --> 29:55.761
Angie?

29:56.829 --> 29:58.297
Still nothing!
Angie?

29:58.397 --> 30:01.233
Angie!
This barrel's been moved recently.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.434
And it's sealed.

30:02.534 --> 30:05.104
Dante, Mel, over here!

30:08.774 --> 30:10.342
Angie! Angie!

30:10.442 --> 30:13.379
Put her down. Careful.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.650
She's alive!

30:18.750 --> 30:19.886
Oh, thank God.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.187
Okay, Angie, come on.
Wake up, wake up.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.855
Wake up. Angie!
Get those off.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.623
Hey, hey, hey, breathe.

30:24.723 --> 30:25.992
There you go.
You're okay.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.027
You're okay. We got you.
You're safe now.

30:34.533 --> 30:38.170
Okay. Here we are.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.542
Doctor said
you should rest, so,

30:43.642 --> 30:45.111
why don't you lie down

30:45.211 --> 30:46.478
while I put this stuff away?

30:46.578 --> 30:48.714
And you-you promise me
Craig's okay?

30:48.814 --> 30:50.116
Oh, absolutely.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.251
He is safe
with Child Services

30:52.351 --> 30:53.852
until we can
make arrangements

30:53.953 --> 30:57.023
to get you both
into the center.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.331
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

31:06.332 --> 31:08.367
Oh, Angie.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.038
You're safe now.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.639
Doug's still out there.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.641
He won't find you here.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.910
I paid cash, I used a fake name.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.578
There's a police officer downstairs,

31:19.678 --> 31:21.847
and lots more
searching the city for him.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.515
There are?
Yeah.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.784
And they won't stop
until they find him.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.590
And I promise

31:31.690 --> 31:34.060
I will stay with you tonight
and every night

31:34.160 --> 31:35.461
until he's in custody.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.064
You've done so much
for me already. I'd be dead

31:38.164 --> 31:39.765
if it weren't for you
and your friends.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.267
Don't sell yourself short.

31:41.367 --> 31:46.138
You had the courage to
leave an abusive marriage.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.841
The strength
to stay alive in that barrel,

31:49.942 --> 31:53.045
long after others
would have given up.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.481
Craig is all
I thought about in there.

31:55.581 --> 31:56.815
That's what kept me alive.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.850
You know, he's been through
so much already.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.087
I couldn't leave him
without a mother.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.155
He is so lucky to have you.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.923
You don't think
I could see him tonight?

32:05.024 --> 32:07.126
I just really want to hold him.
I know.

32:07.226 --> 32:10.529
But I think it's best
if you laid low tonight.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.931
In the morning, we will
go to Child Services,

32:13.032 --> 32:14.833
and you'll be able
to see him, I promise.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.235
But right now,

32:16.335 --> 32:19.371
you need to rest and to eat.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.640
I don't know about you, but...

32:21.740 --> 32:24.276
I am starving.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.245
I could go
for some comfort food.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.446
Yeah.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.418
Again... thank you.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.523
Yeah.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.025
Any signs of Doug?

32:39.125 --> 32:41.460
Checked under every rock--
his cards,

32:41.560 --> 32:42.828
everything.

32:42.928 --> 32:44.130
Uh, still nothing.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.364
All right, well,
keep looking.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.333
Dante, any updates on Doug?

32:47.433 --> 32:49.801
We have every available unit
out looking for him.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.703
If he's anywhere in the
tristate area, we'll find him.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.005
It's possible he's running.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.373
Okay, we got to find this guy.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.974
He's never gonna give Angie
any peace.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.609
Rob, you got
to look at this.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.645
Hold on.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.013
What is it?
That's not good.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.215
That's not good at all.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.759
Be right back. Grabbing a bite.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.493
You thought
I wouldn't find you?

33:47.593 --> 33:48.927
Angie?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.996
Huh?!

33:51.097 --> 33:52.598
Huh?!

33:52.698 --> 33:55.000
Get away from her!

33:57.203 --> 33:58.570
Get over here.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.312
I said
get away from her.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.250
Get out. Now.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.186
Look at you.

34:15.354 --> 34:17.956
Shaking like a leaf.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.561
Don't come any closer.
Or what?

34:22.661 --> 34:24.230
You'll shoot me?

34:25.364 --> 34:29.000
We both know you don't have
what it takes.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.104
That's what I thought.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.981
Aunt Vi.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.850
It's okay.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.385
Put it down. Take your finger
off the trigger.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.554
It's me.
Look, look at me.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.722
It's me, Aunt Vi.
Let it go.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.124
Let it go.
I'm here.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.959
I'm here. I'm here.
It's okay. It's okay.

34:54.059 --> 34:56.662
Okay, okay.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.598
Okay. You're good.
It's all right.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.200
It's all right.

35:11.543 --> 35:15.181
Well, we figured out
how Doug knew she was here.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.149
He bought some Bluetooth
trackers a few months ago.

35:17.249 --> 35:20.919
We found one sewn into
the lining of Angie's purse.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.390
Doug was a monster.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.259
She's gonna need
some time.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.894
She's gonna need
a big support system.

35:28.994 --> 35:31.797
But I think we can
help with that.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.735
Angie?
Yeah.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.371
I want you to
take this card.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.606
What is this?

35:40.706 --> 35:41.873
It's a bank
account number.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.342
Funds have already
been deposited.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.811
Should be enough to help you
get back on your feet.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.282
I don't know what to say.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.984
Just remember you're
not alone in this.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.987
Ms. Novack. Yeah.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.424
I can take you to see
your son, if you're ready.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.459
Yes.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.431
You take care
of yourself.

36:05.531 --> 36:08.300
I'll be checking on you.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.004
Thank you.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.414
That was quite an ordeal.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.849
You sure you're okay?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.984
Thanks to you showing up.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.320
So, you want to tell me
how long you've been packing?

36:28.420 --> 36:30.922
Since you were abducted.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.425
Dee's not the only one
who felt the need

36:33.525 --> 36:35.994
to protect herself.
You should've come to me.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.599
But I, I get it.

36:43.168 --> 36:45.170
Are you sure you're okay?

36:45.271 --> 36:46.872
Ms. Marsette, you up for
coming to the station?

36:46.972 --> 36:48.507
Of course.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.142
Can't it wait till tomorrow?
Robyn.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.245
Stop. I'm okay.
I'll take care of him.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.846
Really.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.251
See you at the house.

37:04.490 --> 37:07.593
Hey, you wanted to
show me something?

37:07.693 --> 37:09.261
Yeah.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.429
Okay.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.230
You okay?
Yeah.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.499
Yeah?

37:13.599 --> 37:16.234
I'm happy that we
were able to help Angie.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.638
But you're still thinking
about your friend, Tracy.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.508
I just wish I knew
what happened to her.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.175
Well...

37:29.180 --> 37:30.849
You found her?
Uh-huh.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.318
She's okay.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.386
She and her new husband,
whose last name she took.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.355
Which is why
you couldn't find her.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.589
She looks so happy.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.957
Yeah.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.926
What happened to her ex?

37:41.026 --> 37:43.495
He died in prison last month.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.230
Which is when she,
not coincidentally,

37:45.331 --> 37:47.032
started posting
on social media again.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.502
She finally felt safe.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.170
Yeah.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.306
Thank you.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.907
For finding her.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.077
And for being you.

38:07.218 --> 38:08.487
Jackson, what's up?

38:08.587 --> 38:09.488
I just got word

38:09.588 --> 38:10.589
that Lo-Lo's leaving town.

38:10.689 --> 38:11.857
He's stopping by
his girl's house

38:11.957 --> 38:13.559
to say goodbye,
and then he's out.

38:14.526 --> 38:15.827
395 Richards Street?

38:15.927 --> 38:16.928
Yeah.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.196
Yo, you didn't hear it from me.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.499
I care about Manny too,
all right?

38:20.599 --> 38:22.601
You get this guy.
Trust me.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.407
I'm taking him down.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.378
You don't have to go.

38:32.478 --> 38:33.445
Why wouldn't I?

38:36.348 --> 38:38.984
I'll be back, all right?
Going somewhere, Lo-Lo?

38:40.018 --> 38:41.420
Leave him alone!

38:43.389 --> 38:45.123
Go, Lo-Lo!

38:50.328 --> 38:52.030
It's over, Lo-Lo.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.400
Lo-Lo, stop!

39:20.526 --> 39:22.327
Hey, Dee.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.229
Hey, Mom.
What's going on?

39:25.196 --> 39:28.366
I'm just down here
keeping an eye on your Aunt Vi.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.301
She's had a rough
couple of days.

39:30.402 --> 39:31.703
Is she okay?

39:31.803 --> 39:33.905
Yeah, she's fine.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.378
You know, remember
when I told you that

39:40.479 --> 39:42.347
flight can be
your best weapon?

39:42.448 --> 39:45.884
Mm-hmm.
Well, Aunt Vi was
put in a position

39:45.984 --> 39:48.053
where running
was not an option.

39:49.354 --> 39:52.323
What happened?
The details aren't important.

39:52.424 --> 39:53.959
Just that
sometimes in life,

39:54.059 --> 39:55.561
you will have your back
against the wall.

39:55.661 --> 39:59.465
And you will have no choice
but to fight your way out of it.

40:00.532 --> 40:01.967
That's where
training comes in.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.203
And having good people
you can count on.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.474
Like Aunt Vi does.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.710
Like you always will.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.816
It's hard to believe
someone as strong as Aunt Vi

40:17.916 --> 40:18.984
could actually be afraid.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.220
Did you ever run away
from danger?

40:22.320 --> 40:25.223
Yes. And I don't mind
admitting it.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.827
Because if I hadn't,

40:28.927 --> 40:31.096
I probably
wouldn't be here today.

40:33.364 --> 40:36.635
And there's nothing
more important to me than that.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.472
I love you.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.974
Oh, I love you, too.
I love you more.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.312
I'm gonna go
get ready for bed.

40:47.412 --> 40:48.446
Yeah.

40:49.515 --> 40:50.916
That sounds like a good plan.

40:51.016 --> 40:53.351
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna join you.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.970
You okay?

41:12.070 --> 41:13.104
Fine.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.473
I was, uh...

41:15.574 --> 41:17.743
just putting away
the dishes and it,

41:17.843 --> 41:19.945
it just slipped
right out of my hand.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.446
I don't know what,

41:21.547 --> 41:24.149
what's wrong with me.
It's okay. That's okay.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.051
We'll clean it up later.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.620
Come here.
Come with me.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.088
Come.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.558
Yeah.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.393
Yeah, just sit down.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.695
Sit down.

41:39.731 --> 41:43.234
You want to talk about it?
It might help.

41:44.803 --> 41:48.106
You prepare for something
like that, you...

41:48.206 --> 41:49.741
you do all this training,

41:49.841 --> 41:52.210
you...
Aunt Vi,

41:52.310 --> 41:57.115
pointing a gun at someone
with the intent to kill

41:57.215 --> 42:00.351
can be just as traumatic as
pulling the trigger.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.592
How am I supposed to
take care of...

42:06.692 --> 42:08.827
Dee?

42:08.927 --> 42:10.161
Protect you?

42:10.261 --> 42:12.197
Aunt Vi, you protect us
all the time.

42:12.297 --> 42:15.967
It might not be
in you to kill.

42:16.067 --> 42:19.671
That doesn't make you weak.
That makes you human.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.540
It's a good thing.
It doesn't feel good.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.810
Aunt Vi...

42:24.910 --> 42:27.579
there's enough violence
in the world.

42:27.679 --> 42:29.815
Truth is, I wish
it weren't so...

42:31.216 --> 42:33.251
...easy for me.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.824
I'm so glad
you were there.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.694
I'm so grateful
to be alive.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.234
Yeah.

42:51.002 --> 42:52.203
I'm there.
