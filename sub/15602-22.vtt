00:24.486 --> 00:27.215
Now let's destroy the rest of these
Manhunters and get out of here!

00:27.258 --> 00:28.660
You will not harm them.

00:28.704 --> 00:32.241
They function without
emotion, as I do now.

00:32.645 --> 00:34.484
I shall be their Queen.

00:37.883 --> 00:41.068
Season 1, Episode 22:
<b>"Love is a Battlefield"</b>

Sync & corrections: Reef
www.addic7ed.com

00:45.358 --> 00:46.902
Sisters, look!

00:55.163 --> 00:56.731
Invasion!

01:09.776 --> 01:11.344
Hyah! Unh!

01:13.782 --> 01:15.116
Hyah!

01:26.098 --> 01:27.700
Unh!

01:29.803 --> 01:31.972
Manhunters here?

01:37.112 --> 01:38.581
Hyah! Huh!

01:46.991 --> 01:49.226
Hyah! Hyah!

01:49.893 --> 01:52.083
No man escapes
the Manhunters.

01:52.117 --> 01:56.588
I am no man. I am Aga'po,
Queen of the Zamarons!

01:59.637 --> 02:03.306
As soon as the scanners locate Aya, we'll
set a course directly for her coordinates.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.731
- If we find her.
- What's that supposed to mean?

02:06.773 --> 02:10.490
Hey. Look. I love your cockeyed
optimism, but she was our nav computer.

02:10.547 --> 02:14.216
All the stuff we need to find her
we can't do so well without her.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.295
Aya needs our help
more than ever.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.288
She's confused,
and her processors are misfiring.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.323
Confused? We wish.

02:21.391 --> 02:25.194
Going off the deep end and plugging
into that invincible Antimonitor body?

02:25.215 --> 02:27.350
We'll be probably
be saving folks <i>from</i> her.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.043
Aya has helped pull our fat
from the fire plenty of times.

02:30.135 --> 02:32.036
Now we're gonna
return the favor.

02:32.104 --> 02:34.305
If only we knew
where she was.

02:51.893 --> 02:56.930
Star Sapphires of Zamaron, I demand
an audience with your Queen.

02:57.032 --> 03:00.360
You are the robot
that served the Green Lanterns.

03:00.403 --> 03:02.404
Why have you come
here making war?

03:02.472 --> 03:06.214
I have gained the understanding
that the emotion you serve, love,

03:06.253 --> 03:08.444
is not only useless,
but destructive.

03:08.512 --> 03:13.650
Love does not destroy. It sustains
and strengthens all who feel it.

03:13.718 --> 03:15.186
That is a lie.

03:15.253 --> 03:18.756
I loved and was loved only
to have that love retracted,

03:18.824 --> 03:20.858
leaving me nothing but pain.

03:20.926 --> 03:23.327
You, a machine?

03:23.395 --> 03:27.698
A truly living being would trust
that love will always prevail.

03:27.766 --> 03:32.971
Negative. I am here to punish you
for cultivating this corrosive force.

03:33.039 --> 03:36.342
How dare you insult all
we stand for, intruder?

03:42.850 --> 03:44.518
Unh!

03:47.689 --> 03:49.523
[groans]

03:49.591 --> 03:53.194
I hope that you are finished
with your futile resistance.

03:53.261 --> 03:56.831
Our Queen needs medical care.
Please let us take her to the infirmary.

03:56.898 --> 04:02.069
You may try and save her, but it is for
nothing, just as love is for nothing.

04:02.137 --> 04:05.406
The best way to find Aya
is to get to Oa and scan from there.

04:05.473 --> 04:07.241
We're two months from Oa.

04:07.309 --> 04:10.678
Sure. At regular speed, but
an ultra-warp... 10 minutes tops,

04:10.746 --> 04:12.180
if we don't stop for coffee.

04:12.248 --> 04:15.777
Ultra-warp without a nav A.I.?
Way to risky.

04:15.808 --> 04:17.620
One tiny rounding error,

04:17.689 --> 04:20.456
and we end up smack dab inside
the molten core of a planet.

04:20.524 --> 04:24.808
But if you're right about how volatile
Aya is, we have no choice.

04:25.377 --> 04:26.944
Why do you want
to destroy us?

04:26.979 --> 04:29.932
Yes, we serve love because
love is the one thing

04:29.959 --> 04:33.502
that will eventually bring peace
and harmony to the Universe.

04:33.570 --> 04:36.939
If you had ever felt love,
you would know you are wrong.

04:37.007 --> 04:39.608
I have loved, I do love.

04:39.676 --> 04:42.444
Who do you love that you
are so sure of this?

04:42.512 --> 04:45.281
I love Hal Jordan of Earth.

04:45.315 --> 04:47.588
And who does he love?

04:48.724 --> 04:50.778
He loves another.

04:50.821 --> 04:54.087
So your love has brought
you nothing but pain.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.093
Yes. I mean, no.

04:57.161 --> 05:00.396
How will that pain bring
peace to the Universe?

05:00.464 --> 05:02.799
It will... I cannot say.

05:02.866 --> 05:06.618
You have dedicated your life,
your entire planet's purpose

05:06.673 --> 05:09.405
to something
you cannot explain.

05:09.450 --> 05:14.477
We gained our understanding of love
from a teacher who is not on Zamaron.

05:14.545 --> 05:20.483
- Then bring this teacher here.
- Impossible. She is half a Universe away.

05:20.551 --> 05:23.386
Teleport her with your
crystalline apparatus.

05:23.454 --> 05:24.754
We cannot.

05:24.822 --> 05:28.057
The portal reunites beings
that share a love between them.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.660
It cannot bring one
without the other.

05:30.728 --> 05:35.298
Your supposition and technology
are respectively wrong and primitive.

05:35.366 --> 05:36.833
Unh!

06:02.938 --> 06:05.223
Oh, not again...

06:09.903 --> 06:12.972
Will this take long?
The buffet closes in 5 minutes.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.305
Carol Ferris, I am sorry
you were taken so abruptly

06:16.329 --> 06:18.569
and in the middle of
such important matters.

06:18.612 --> 06:23.583
It was not our choice.
You were brought here by this Aya.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.385
Right...

06:25.452 --> 06:29.989
Aya comes to us for answers about love,
so I thought it best you speak to her.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.325
Well, of course it...
Wait. What now?

06:32.393 --> 06:35.026
Carol Ferris of Earth,
can you convince me

06:35.067 --> 06:38.264
that the Zamarons and love
should not be destroyed?

06:38.332 --> 06:42.502
Well, I... Wait. Destroyed?
Wait. You want to destroy love?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.868
I will destroy love's proxy
in the Universe,

06:44.915 --> 06:49.176
the Zamaron home world, unless
you can give me a reason not to.

06:49.243 --> 06:54.448
Oh. So no pressure then.
Well, um, I don't know.

06:54.515 --> 06:58.952
Love is a battlefield,
love is patient, love is kind.

06:59.020 --> 07:03.490
My love was unkind. He offered
his love, then took it back.

07:03.558 --> 07:08.361
Oh. Uh, OK. Well, it is not proud.
It is not easily angered.

07:08.429 --> 07:12.776
False. When love is revoked,
it creates anger and resentment.

07:13.104 --> 07:14.637
Aah!

07:14.769 --> 07:19.239
- Carol, tell Aya what you told me.
- I don't know!

07:19.604 --> 07:25.317
OK. All I said is that love is about
doing what's best for the one your love.

07:25.357 --> 07:30.106
It's as simple as putting his or her needs
before your own, but I'm no expert.

07:30.145 --> 07:34.789
- I'm just someone who fell in love.
- Whom did you love?

07:34.857 --> 07:38.894
I loved Hal Jordan...
Love Hal Jordan.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.562
I guess that's the hard part.

07:40.630 --> 07:44.833
I'll always love him, even
though he makes me so angry.

07:44.901 --> 07:48.670
Then you hate and love the
same person simultaneously.

07:49.034 --> 07:50.921
I could never hate Hal.

07:50.976 --> 07:55.244
He may drive me crazy, but
he'll always have a place in my heart.

07:55.526 --> 07:58.915
So you posit that love
is stronger than hate.

07:58.983 --> 08:02.719
- Of course.
- Excellent. We shall see.

08:02.786 --> 08:06.055
There shall be a trial by
combat between love and hate.

08:06.123 --> 08:12.228
- Emotions can't really fight each other.
- Negative. I will force them to.

08:19.036 --> 08:21.337
All right. Looks like
we're ready for ultra-warp.

08:21.405 --> 08:24.493
Aya makes those calculations
in a fraction of a second.

08:24.532 --> 08:26.976
Raze has been working
on that for 3 hours.

08:27.044 --> 08:30.080
I'm reasonably sure
I addressed all of the variables.

08:30.147 --> 08:33.984
Oh, as long as you're <i>reasonably sure</i>...
Jordan, look at this map.

08:34.052 --> 08:37.321
There are 50 near misses
in the anders nebula alone.

08:37.388 --> 08:40.924
No human brain can react fast enough
to get through that alive.

08:40.991 --> 08:44.308
Flying is mostly instinct.
There's no brain involved.

08:44.996 --> 08:48.298
- You know what I mean.
- It's worth it if it gets us to Aya.

08:48.366 --> 08:51.401
Razer's right.
She needs our help now.

08:54.439 --> 08:58.242
In 3, 2, 1, and power.

09:04.816 --> 09:08.057
How exactly are you gonna make
love and hate fight each other?

09:08.100 --> 09:10.234
I will summon
hate's champion.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.228
Who freed me from my cell?

09:21.296 --> 09:22.796
A Green Lantern?

09:22.864 --> 09:26.102
Errr!

09:26.867 --> 09:28.768
Not quite.

09:28.835 --> 09:33.146
Atrocitus of the Red Lanterns,
you are here to represent hate

09:33.177 --> 09:35.873
in a fight to the death
against love's champion,

09:35.908 --> 09:37.408
Carol Ferris of Earth.

09:37.447 --> 09:39.934
No! Carol Ferris
is an innocent.

09:39.973 --> 09:42.412
Please let me be
love's champion.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.750
You yourself said Carol Ferris possesses
the greatest understanding of love.

09:46.817 --> 09:48.318
She is chosen.

09:48.386 --> 09:51.321
And why should I agree
to this melee?

09:51.389 --> 09:54.812
Should you win, the prize
is your freedom and the death

09:54.836 --> 09:59.252
of your opponent Hal Jordan's
one true love, Carol Ferris.

10:00.030 --> 10:03.233
That is acceptable.

10:03.300 --> 10:08.294
Wait. This is nuts!
I can't fight an alien warlord.

10:08.405 --> 10:11.041
Are those serrated teeth?

10:11.108 --> 10:14.087
[chiming]

10:14.111 --> 10:17.213
Here. The Star Sapphire Ring
you returned before.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.328
Right. Because if I'm gonna
be battling to the death,

10:19.329 --> 10:21.859
I should at least be
well-accessorized.

10:27.617 --> 10:29.551
Of course
the fight must be fair.

10:29.590 --> 10:32.467
Atrocitus should have
his Power Ring, as well.

10:42.253 --> 10:46.010
Ha! Errr.

10:46.077 --> 10:51.649
Yaaah!

10:51.716 --> 10:56.054
Aah!

10:56.121 --> 10:59.663
[breathing heavily]

11:00.992 --> 11:03.660
Are you insane?
How is that fair?

11:07.499 --> 11:11.268
Coming out of ultra-warp
in 3, 2, 1.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.276
Did this figure into
your calculations?

11:19.344 --> 11:21.913
We've jumped right into
the atmosphere of a star.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.681
I see that.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.801
One half a degree,
and we'd have been vaporized.

11:44.869 --> 11:48.105
But instead we're alive, and
we're that much closer to Oa.

11:48.173 --> 11:50.678
- Next time, we'll just remember to...
- Next time?!

11:50.709 --> 11:53.230
Uh-uh. We're never
doing that again.

12:01.089 --> 12:02.522
Errrr.

12:02.568 --> 12:07.287
Aya, I am not the champion of love.
Please call this off!

12:07.355 --> 12:09.923
Fight or die.

12:12.093 --> 12:13.293
Ha!

12:26.310 --> 12:28.445
[growling]

12:31.816 --> 12:33.650
Unimpressive.

12:40.311 --> 12:42.119
Think, Carol, think!

12:50.402 --> 12:52.203
Rawwr!

12:56.842 --> 13:00.412
I can't do this, I can't!

13:00.479 --> 13:03.448
Wait. The Star Sapphire's
special power.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.519
Bring me the one I love.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.335
Carol!

13:16.396 --> 13:18.364
<i>Atrocitus!</i>

13:18.665 --> 13:20.266
Jordan, wait!

13:46.861 --> 13:51.417
Only the strength of love
could bring Carol Ferris a hero.

13:51.966 --> 13:55.969
Hal Jordan, please be safe.

13:56.132 --> 13:59.665
- Do you know what the heck that was?
- He's been transported to Zamaron.

13:59.719 --> 14:04.511
Then we got to high-tail it there.
Atrocitus was waiting for him, Atrocitus!

14:04.579 --> 14:08.377
Zamaron is in Frontier Space.
We'd have to use ultra-warp.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.017
Then let's go.

14:28.335 --> 14:32.427
When last we met, human,
I had just conquered Oa.

14:32.472 --> 14:36.408
This time, you find
me better rested.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.862
The Star Sapphire Ring doesn't let you
drag just anyone across the Universe.

15:07.885 --> 15:09.867
It was either you
or my high-school prom date,

15:09.898 --> 15:11.910
And he's an accountant
in Tucson.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.979
Errr!

15:21.888 --> 15:23.189
Aah!

15:26.595 --> 15:28.267
Carol!

15:30.030 --> 15:31.338
Unh!

15:35.335 --> 15:36.869
[gasp]

15:42.609 --> 15:44.209
[growling]

15:44.277 --> 15:45.711
No!

15:48.381 --> 15:49.848
Unh!

15:54.010 --> 15:56.010
Ghiata, no.

15:56.102 --> 15:58.603
This wasn't your fight.

16:02.054 --> 16:05.055
Your mate is next.

16:25.516 --> 16:29.319
I've had just about enough of you!
You are done, over!

16:53.711 --> 16:57.131
Ghiata, you shouldn't have.

16:58.249 --> 17:04.815
There is no greater privilege than
to perform a deed born of pure love

17:05.260 --> 17:13.089
and no greater honor than
that it should be my last.

17:18.436 --> 17:22.772
There is your proof that love
is the strongest force in the Universe.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.377
Only love could cause
beings to put themselves

17:25.392 --> 17:27.469
so completely
in harm's way,

17:27.490 --> 17:32.132
and then make the ultimate sacrifice:
one's life.

17:39.289 --> 17:43.059
I am comforted that Ghiata
did not die in vain.

17:43.126 --> 17:48.832
She proved love is superior and
saved our planet from destruction.

17:48.988 --> 17:51.590
We owe her our lives.

17:51.868 --> 17:54.768
Love is not superior.

17:55.772 --> 17:57.466
But I represented love,

17:57.481 --> 18:00.002
and I am not the one smashed
under a rock right now.

18:00.027 --> 18:01.984
I won, we won.

18:02.078 --> 18:04.346
No. Atrocitus lost.

18:04.414 --> 18:07.349
He and his ring shall be sent
back from where they came.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.919
<i>His failure is unacceptable.</i>

18:15.926 --> 18:19.162
Aah!

18:31.274 --> 18:33.041
Aya, please listen to me.

18:33.093 --> 18:35.877
Just stop and consider
everything that's happened here.

18:35.921 --> 18:38.406
I... we would like to help you.

18:38.453 --> 18:41.754
This trial demonstrated
that love causes only pain.

18:41.793 --> 18:44.920
It foolishly led Ghiata
to her own destruction.

18:44.988 --> 18:49.025
No. It led her to an act
of total selflessness.

18:49.093 --> 18:50.961
All life is pain.

18:51.028 --> 18:54.322
I now understand that the best thing
I can do for the Universe

18:54.361 --> 18:56.046
is to eliminate all life

18:56.085 --> 18:59.870
and replace it with emotionless
machines like my loyal Manhunters.

18:59.944 --> 19:01.985
What?! Aya, that's crazy.

19:02.031 --> 19:04.654
You fought alongside me
against the same enemies.

19:04.701 --> 19:07.267
You were as alive as I am,
and now...

19:07.307 --> 19:10.509
Prepare for the total annihilation
of Zamaron.

19:16.087 --> 19:18.789
No, Aya.
I won't let you do this.

19:24.629 --> 19:27.031
I do not recall
giving you a choice.

19:42.547 --> 19:44.081
Aya!

19:51.723 --> 19:54.826
Aya, what are you doing?

19:57.596 --> 20:02.411
To destroy life a single planet
at a time is illogical and inefficient.

20:02.458 --> 20:05.773
I will find a way to erase all
life in one motion

20:05.809 --> 20:11.352
and remake the entire Universe
in my own image, free of all emotion.

20:27.126 --> 20:32.163
Carol Ferris, and Hal Jordan,
you have saved us from destruction.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.699
We are forever grateful.

20:34.767 --> 20:39.838
I only wish we could have saved Ghiata.
She is a true hero.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.341
We'll keep her in our hearts.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.479
The last time you were here,

20:44.518 --> 20:48.774
you returned the Star Sapphire Ring,
and this time?

20:52.984 --> 20:54.520
I think I'll keep it.

20:54.552 --> 20:57.054
You never know when
it might come in handy.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.890
You honor us by doing so.

21:06.398 --> 21:07.832
So...

21:11.169 --> 21:14.123
Thanks for being there
when I called, Hal.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.976
I'll be seeing you around...
The galaxy.

21:21.945 --> 21:24.945
