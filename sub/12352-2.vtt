WEBVTT

00:10.360 --> 00:11.684
The head of 
admissions called.

00:11.685 --> 00:14.230
I've been accepted into CRU Law!

00:14.264 --> 00:16.465
- I'm scared I'm gonna lose her.
- You are losing her.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.067
Nothing's changed.

00:18.068 --> 00:20.605
I can't just try again
with you after everything

00:20.606 --> 00:23.405
because you haven't done
anything to earn that.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.840
I can change. I'll show you.

00:24.875 --> 00:25.741
You know, you've shown me

00:25.742 --> 00:28.051
how incredibly loyal and
generous someone can be,

00:28.052 --> 00:30.112
but you've also shown
me how pride can

00:30.146 --> 00:31.588
really threaten to ruin a guy.

00:31.589 --> 00:32.948
Dale? What are you doing here?

00:32.983 --> 00:35.150
Oh, no, it's all good.
I rolled with Abby and Betsy.

00:35.185 --> 00:36.585
Check it out.
I'm wearing our letters.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.020
You're not even in
the Greek system!

00:38.054 --> 00:40.089
How else would I know
that the KTs helped elect

00:40.123 --> 00:42.024
Calvin president to make
this whole truce happen?

00:42.058 --> 00:44.360
The KTs helped elect Calvin?

00:50.433 --> 00:52.630
Did you know that
the CRU Atheist Club

00:52.631 --> 00:54.203
has an annual ski trip?

00:54.237 --> 00:55.473
They should get used
to a warmer climate

00:55.474 --> 00:56.205
where they're headed.

00:56.239 --> 00:59.241
Dale, I was having the best dream.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.777
Bradley Cooper and I got married

01:00.778 --> 01:02.278
and started our own law firm,

01:02.312 --> 01:03.630
Cartwright & Cooper.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.581
Sorry, I'm trying to
find a college club.

01:05.615 --> 01:06.926
I'm halfway to graduation and

01:06.927 --> 01:09.051
I still haven't found
Mrs. Dale Ian Kettlewell.

01:09.085 --> 01:10.653
Moving a little fast, aren't you?

01:10.687 --> 01:13.789
No, I just want to
find an attractive,

01:13.823 --> 01:15.334
educated young woman while

01:15.335 --> 01:17.660
I'm still surrounded
by them at college.

01:17.694 --> 01:18.836
Well, you do work at ZBZ.

01:18.837 --> 01:20.529
Yeah, which puts me
too close to them.

01:20.564 --> 01:22.188
They just think of me
as one of the girls,

01:22.189 --> 01:23.465
and not even one of the hot ones.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.501
Uh, then maybe you should
try being one of the guys.

01:25.535 --> 01:29.038
Hey, um, what about joining a
fraternity? It is rush week.

01:29.072 --> 01:33.242
Come on! I was the
founding father of U-SAG.

01:33.276 --> 01:34.990
I'd be a huge hypocrite.
And besides that,

01:34.991 --> 01:36.378
the only girl I'd be interested in

01:36.413 --> 01:38.981
isn't even in the Greek
community anymore, so...

01:44.020 --> 01:45.788
- Ah!
- What the...?

01:45.822 --> 01:48.257
Case, I love you,

01:48.258 --> 01:50.693
and I don't mind being the
lone Cartwright on campus,

01:50.727 --> 01:53.295
but I do need to be the lone
Cartwright in this apartment.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.308
Oh, trust me, I'm looking,
but everything

01:55.309 --> 01:57.866
in my price range is rented,
including the law dorms.

01:57.901 --> 01:59.042
Which is what happens when you

01:59.043 --> 02:00.869
get into law school a
week before classes start.

02:00.904 --> 02:02.571
Hey, no, I call Alios!

02:02.606 --> 02:04.006
You can't call it, I live here!

02:04.040 --> 02:05.741
- Fine.
- Get out of here!

02:05.775 --> 02:07.977
Of course you get
the cereal you want.

02:08.011 --> 02:09.645
Mom always gave you
first choice. Mm!

02:09.679 --> 02:10.746
Yeah, because she loves me more.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.548
- Oh!
- Have some Soy Flakes.

02:12.582 --> 02:14.550
- Morning, Case.
- Morning, Dana.

02:14.584 --> 02:17.453
Hey, cute top. I think I
have one just like it.

02:17.487 --> 02:19.521
Um, you actually have this one.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.857
I forgot my overnight bag
and I needed a shirt.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.759
It's a good thing all
these boxes were here.

02:23.793 --> 02:26.295
By the way,

02:26.329 --> 02:29.331
if you guys are gonna watch Star
Wars until 3am in your room,

02:29.366 --> 02:32.067
could you just put the
volume down a little bit?

02:32.102 --> 02:33.602
Right, sorry.

02:33.637 --> 02:35.604
- I'm gonna actually...
- I'm gonna go to KT house.

02:35.639 --> 02:37.973
That's odd.

02:38.008 --> 02:40.476
You know he doesn't have a
TV in his bedroom, right?

02:40.510 --> 02:41.369
OK, but I heard that scene

02:41.370 --> 02:44.647
where they blow up the Death Star,
like, ten times.

02:44.681 --> 02:46.315
"Stabilize your rear deflectors."

02:46.349 --> 02:47.650
"You're in range, target coming up.

02:47.684 --> 02:49.184
"Almost there." "Stay on target!"

02:49.219 --> 02:50.853
"Almost there." "Hold 'em!"

02:50.887 --> 02:54.089
"Almost there! Torpedoes away!"

02:54.124 --> 02:57.226
- Oh, my God!
- Boom!

02:57.260 --> 03:00.262
They were...? Oh, God.

03:00.296 --> 03:02.831
That would never happen.
Never happen.

03:02.866 --> 03:05.868
All right. So now, I will now
turn things over to the brother

03:05.902 --> 03:07.525
who almost became our president,

03:07.526 --> 03:09.605
but instead became
something even cooler:

03:09.639 --> 03:12.107
Our very own Rust Chair, Rushy!

03:12.142 --> 03:16.812
I mean Rush Chair, Rusty!

03:19.382 --> 03:20.583
Well, I take it karmic synergy

03:20.584 --> 03:21.784
will do most of the heavy lifting?

03:21.818 --> 03:23.390
You take it correctly.

03:23.391 --> 03:26.021
So just sit back and let the
all-knowing cosmic force

03:26.056 --> 03:27.556
do the work for you. Right, guys?

03:27.590 --> 03:30.426
Are we short a few guys?

03:31.861 --> 03:33.262
Um....

03:33.296 --> 03:36.398
I thought we'd be in
full force for rush week,

03:36.433 --> 03:39.868
but apparently not.
So who are we missing?

03:39.903 --> 03:42.971
- Wait. Where's Ben Bennett?
- Ben Bennett! Of course!

03:43.006 --> 03:44.499
Oh, brother, where art thou?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.341
No one's seen him
since homecoming.

03:46.376 --> 03:47.976
What about Dewey and Marbles?

03:48.011 --> 03:49.545
I haven't heard from
them since the accident.

03:49.579 --> 03:52.681
What accident?

03:54.517 --> 03:56.552
- It's a really long story.
- Sounds like they're gonzo.

03:56.586 --> 03:58.153
Yeah, I haven't seen
him in a while either.

03:58.188 --> 04:01.323
- I think I saw him on Scrubs.
- We've lost a lot of guys.

04:01.357 --> 04:02.491
Should we be worried?

04:04.494 --> 04:08.130
Karmic synergy will provide
us with plenty of pledges.

04:08.164 --> 04:12.234
It always does.
All right? Meeting adjourned.

04:12.268 --> 04:16.839
So all brothers report to
the TV for Yo Gabba Gabba!

04:16.873 --> 04:20.242
Gabba, Gabba, Beav.

04:20.276 --> 04:21.677
It's gonna be a good episode.

04:25.749 --> 04:28.150
Yes, we should worry.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.885
A lot.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.830 --> 04:42.997
And I can understand why you
guys would be pissed at me,

04:43.032 --> 04:45.533
but I don't see working
with the KTs as a betrayal

04:45.568 --> 04:47.746
because ending the feud was
for the good of the house.

04:47.747 --> 04:49.337
It's a waste of time.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.910
We don't see it as a waste of time,

04:50.911 --> 04:52.273
and no one asked you to end it.

04:52.308 --> 04:54.676
We especially didn't need
you lying to us about it.

04:54.710 --> 04:56.228
I should be president now. - Yeah.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.746
Why do we have your back

04:57.780 --> 04:59.513
when you're always stabbing ours?

04:59.514 --> 05:01.049
OK, that's a bit exaggerated.

05:01.083 --> 05:01.677
Oh, we supported you

05:01.678 --> 05:04.119
when you and Grant went
public at the Fairy Tale Ball.

05:04.153 --> 05:05.607
But the minute we fight with KT,

05:05.608 --> 05:08.289
you help your boyfriend Heath
and his friends humiliate us.

05:08.324 --> 05:10.825
You ruined our spring break.
I had to sleep on the beach.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.427
A homeless guy almost peed on me!

05:12.461 --> 05:15.096
That is not what I intended,
if that's any help.

05:15.131 --> 05:17.866
Evan was president
during this secret truce.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.300
Did you tell him what
you were gonna do?

05:21.003 --> 05:24.205
No. I acted alone.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.475
Give us one reason why
we shouldn't impeach you.

05:27.510 --> 05:29.811
OK, look, I'm not gonna apologize

05:29.812 --> 05:32.113
for trying to help the house.

05:33.716 --> 05:36.317
OK, but clearly...

05:36.352 --> 05:38.653
...I should have had your backs
and not gone behind them.

05:38.687 --> 05:41.556
And, look, I promise if you
give me a second chance,

05:41.590 --> 05:43.958
I will try to earn your trust.

05:50.065 --> 05:53.635
How did we lose so many guys?
I feel like Jen Aniston.

05:53.669 --> 05:55.170
I imagine without the influx of

05:55.171 --> 05:56.671
at least 20 dues-paying members,

05:56.705 --> 05:58.773
we'll be bankrupt by the
end of the semester.

05:58.808 --> 06:00.606
So, what now? Usually, we just wait

06:00.607 --> 06:03.278
for a bunch of guys who've
never heard of KT before.

06:03.312 --> 06:06.247
Maybe this year we
change it up a bit.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.750
Try to get some guys
to hear about KT.

06:08.784 --> 06:10.418
What about karmic synergy?

06:10.453 --> 06:13.755
I admit, karmic synergy
is a bit passive.

06:16.025 --> 06:17.959
Ok.

06:17.993 --> 06:21.262
Truth is, there's no such
thing as karmic synergy.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.165
- Oh. - Yeah. It was created back in the day
by Egyptian Joe

06:24.200 --> 06:25.018
so we could spend rush week

06:25.019 --> 06:27.202
rushing to have sex
with Tri Pi pledges.

06:27.236 --> 06:30.104
So Cappie wants to try.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.841
OK, our first real rush.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.343
- What do we have to do?
- You're Rush Chair.

06:35.377 --> 06:38.179
I don't know. I've never
done this before either.

06:45.054 --> 06:46.573
It's the same campus,
same bookstore

06:46.574 --> 06:48.335
but everything feels
different now, right?

06:48.336 --> 06:49.384
Yeah, it does.

06:49.385 --> 06:52.160
Look at these books.
We have huge books.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.829
Which would explain the price.

06:54.864 --> 06:56.716
- Hey, remember that?
- Oh,

06:56.717 --> 06:59.667
can you believe this
was us four years ago?

06:59.702 --> 07:02.003
- Except I had highlights.
- I had a goatee.

07:02.037 --> 07:03.538
Which matched my highlights.

07:03.572 --> 07:05.273
It's gonna be weird not being
a part of the Greek system.

07:05.307 --> 07:07.275
I really hope ZBZ has a good rush.

07:07.309 --> 07:08.280
You really sound like Rebecca.

07:08.281 --> 07:09.511
But it is her first
year as president,

07:09.545 --> 07:11.980
so she does have a
reason to obsess. Nice.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.682
I am not obsessing.

07:14.717 --> 07:18.453
Oh, you're gonna miss it a little,
Mr. Purr-fect?

07:18.487 --> 07:21.222
No, I have no interest
in dealing with Omega Chi

07:21.257 --> 07:24.158
or Calvin or his little
plot with the KTs.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.628
I'm moving on, moving forward.

07:26.662 --> 07:28.096
I'm ready to kick your
ass in law school.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.797
Oh, bring it. Me, too.

07:29.832 --> 07:32.100
Forward, it is.

07:33.435 --> 07:34.969
Man!

07:35.004 --> 07:36.871
You really want to visit ZBZ,
don't you?

07:36.906 --> 07:39.507
Oh! So bad. Is that lame?
I'm in law school.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.842
Not for a couple more days.

07:43.445 --> 07:44.812
I will tell Rebecca
that you say hi.

07:44.847 --> 07:47.348
Give her a kiss for me.

07:50.619 --> 07:54.989
Hi. Uh, we're here to try...

07:55.024 --> 07:57.042
We want to sign up
for rush activities.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.060
We're from Kappa Tau.

08:01.664 --> 08:05.767
Oh, this isn't a prank?

08:05.801 --> 08:09.137
Sorry. It's just that you
guys never try. Like, ever.

08:09.171 --> 08:10.565
Granted, but this year KT wants to

08:10.566 --> 08:12.740
do all the same rush stuff
as the other fraternities.

08:12.775 --> 08:15.310
So if you could just tell
us what those things are.

08:15.344 --> 08:16.712
Gee, I'd love to help you guys,

08:16.713 --> 08:18.346
but you missed the
sign-up deadlines.

08:18.380 --> 08:20.848
- We did? For what?
- Well, there was Rushing Roulette

08:20.883 --> 08:23.351
A Seminar on the Consequences
of Dirty Rushing,

08:23.385 --> 08:25.256
and then there's tomorrow's
Go Greek Rallies,

08:25.257 --> 08:26.254
with all the fun booths.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.923
Last year, Omega Chi
did a cigar lounge. Ah!

08:28.958 --> 08:32.860
Ha-ha! Is there a suggestion
box I could fill with vomit?

08:32.895 --> 08:35.730
Doesn't matter, the rally's booked.

08:35.764 --> 08:39.067
The only official rush event
left after that is House Tours.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.703
Which is the one official event
that we bother with anyway.

08:41.736 --> 08:42.571
You could always trust in

08:42.572 --> 08:44.572
some cosmic force of the universe,

08:44.607 --> 08:46.641
- but that would be...
- More helpful than you?

08:48.344 --> 08:50.979
Super bummed for you guys.
Good luck!

09:09.932 --> 09:13.534
So, look, the day that you moved out,
I was gonna tell you,

09:13.569 --> 09:16.804
and I didn't, and I'm sorry.

09:16.839 --> 09:18.606
Yeah, 'cause you were too
busy lying to your house.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.708
I couldn't tell you guys,
all right? If I had,

09:20.743 --> 09:22.210
then the feud would
still be going on.

09:22.244 --> 09:24.646
Look, the whole point of Mission:
Probable...

09:24.680 --> 09:26.000
You named it?

09:26.001 --> 09:28.116
I probably shouldn't
have mentioned the name.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.399
But if you think about it, it's not

09:29.400 --> 09:31.185
that different from you
going behind Cappie's back

09:31.220 --> 09:34.055
- to save your presidency.
- And now I'm the bad guy again.

09:34.089 --> 09:37.325
Let me guess, Call.
It's probably my pride, right?

09:37.359 --> 09:39.284
Look, at least I
screwed over Kappa Tau

09:39.285 --> 09:42.163
and not my own house.

09:42.197 --> 09:43.931
Can't we just put this behind us?

09:45.167 --> 09:46.801
The rest of the house has.

09:46.835 --> 09:48.670
I doubt that.

09:48.704 --> 09:50.705
Actually, we just had a meeting.

09:50.739 --> 09:53.675
And, uh, it was ugly,

09:53.709 --> 09:54.687
but at the end of the day,

09:54.688 --> 09:56.344
the guys understood
where I was coming from.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.279
And they kept me as president.

09:58.313 --> 10:01.649
Well, I guess they're more
forgiving than I'd be.

10:25.507 --> 10:27.608
Our Blue Ribbon! Oh, my God!

10:27.643 --> 10:29.310
I said we should hang
it on the front door!

10:29.344 --> 10:33.281
- I still say Natalie's neck.
- Checking up on me already?

10:33.315 --> 10:36.159
Don't worry,
everything's under control.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.785
I'm sure it is, Becks.

10:37.820 --> 10:38.501
I just came to visit,

10:38.502 --> 10:41.856
and maybe get a little refuge
from Rusty's apartment.

10:41.890 --> 10:44.258
A visit's OK. Pull up a chair.

10:44.293 --> 10:47.395
Sure, sitting's a great idea if
you want to expand your hips.

10:47.429 --> 10:52.300
But the day before a
recruitment? Bad idea.

10:52.334 --> 10:55.970
- Don't you mean rush?
- We call it recruitment now.

10:56.004 --> 10:57.793
Sleeveless turtleneck girl,

10:57.794 --> 11:00.775
French water for a parched
sister? Thank you.

11:02.177 --> 11:03.978
Tegan, what are you doing here?

11:04.012 --> 11:06.748
My job as National Representative.

11:06.782 --> 11:08.750
This is a flagship chapter again,

11:08.784 --> 11:10.733
and after years of scandal,

11:10.734 --> 11:13.621
I'm here to make sure
it stays that way.

11:13.655 --> 11:16.324
What are you doing here,
Casey? I thought you graduated.

11:16.358 --> 11:18.559
It's philanthropy.
We're feeding the homeless.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.795
I am not homeless.

11:20.829 --> 11:24.098
My housing situation is just
in a state of transition.

11:24.133 --> 11:26.601
So, Rebecca,

11:26.635 --> 11:28.536
when do I get to meet
your new house mother?

11:28.570 --> 11:31.339
She's... also in a
state of transition.

11:32.975 --> 11:34.876
Rebecca, you're the president.

11:34.910 --> 11:37.111
You have to have a
house mother right now.

11:37.146 --> 11:38.112
We sent you candidates.

11:38.113 --> 11:39.614
And they were all found wanting.

11:39.648 --> 11:41.323
Which brings me to my next question.

11:41.324 --> 11:43.417
Why aren't you practicing
recruitment drills?

11:43.452 --> 11:45.453
Because we're doing
dinner and a movie.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.855
Is the movie about
recruitment drills?

11:47.890 --> 11:50.358
Have they made one?
Is Anna Faris in it?

11:52.261 --> 11:54.162
Rebecca, you need a house mother.

11:54.163 --> 11:56.063
And Casey, you need a house.

11:56.098 --> 11:58.900
You'll be the house mom
for recruitment week. See?

11:58.934 --> 12:00.301
- Problem solved.
- But I...

12:00.335 --> 12:02.503
Have somewhere
better to stay? Hm...

12:02.538 --> 12:06.741
Now, everyone in formation
for recruitment drills.

12:08.210 --> 12:09.544
Now, ladies!

12:12.215 --> 12:13.313
What did you want me to say?

12:15.471 --> 12:16.970
I'm an alum,
and I don't need to be here

12:16.971 --> 12:18.616
because Rebecca's doing
a masterful job"?

12:18.617 --> 12:19.845
Hey, I only said yes

12:19.846 --> 12:21.390
so I could stay in
the house mom's room

12:21.391 --> 12:23.986
until I find a place that
doesn't have Star Wars sex.

12:23.987 --> 12:26.857
Please, this sorority is the
closest thing you have to drugs.

12:26.858 --> 12:27.990
You get a "Rush" Rush.

12:28.025 --> 12:30.146
Recruitment.
And if you think about it,

12:30.147 --> 12:31.561
I can help you with Tegan.

12:31.595 --> 12:32.929
- No.
- I've dealt with her before.

12:32.963 --> 12:34.497
No!

12:35.566 --> 12:36.832
But you can sweep the floors,

12:36.867 --> 12:39.135
stock the pretzels and
stay out of my way.

12:39.169 --> 12:42.238
Fine. I will just play house mom.

12:42.272 --> 12:43.673
For the week, until Tegan's gone.

12:43.707 --> 12:45.508
You don't want to become
one of those pathetic girls

12:45.542 --> 12:47.743
- who can never leave her sorority.
- Girls?

12:47.778 --> 12:50.112
Don't we have a Go Greek Rally
to get ready for tomorrow?

12:50.147 --> 12:52.815
Let me just get out of your way.

12:52.849 --> 12:54.951
No, no. The house mom goes, too.

12:54.985 --> 12:56.372
For the freshmen girls.

12:56.373 --> 12:58.187
You are the promise
of a maternal figure

12:58.222 --> 13:01.591
for when they need a self-esteem boost,
or need a tampon.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.495
So, the rally. Um...

13:06.530 --> 13:11.200
- That should be fun.
- Here's your apron.

13:11.235 --> 13:13.369
And you may want
to wear a hair net.

13:14.404 --> 13:15.805
My work is done!

13:22.846 --> 13:25.214
Dang it!

13:27.951 --> 13:31.654
This semester, I want to
invest some more time in R & D.

13:31.688 --> 13:32.720
That's smart.

13:32.721 --> 13:34.924
"Research and Development"
Is gonna be really crucial.

13:34.958 --> 13:37.893
I meant "Rusty and Dana."

13:40.797 --> 13:42.164
This year's gonna be phenomenal.

13:42.199 --> 13:44.934
The two of us, conquering
the scientific world

13:44.968 --> 13:46.569
like Pierre and Marie Curie.

13:46.603 --> 13:48.899
But without Marie's
radiation exposure

13:48.900 --> 13:49.538
and subsequent death.

13:49.573 --> 13:51.440
Yeah, no radiation deaths here.

13:51.475 --> 13:52.742
Hey, I actually gotta
get to the house

13:52.776 --> 13:54.844
for this emergency rush meeting.

13:54.878 --> 13:56.182
You see, we actually missed

13:56.183 --> 13:58.114
signing up for a booth
at today's rally,

13:58.148 --> 13:59.949
so we're trying to figure
out some other options.

13:59.983 --> 14:02.685
I thought you guys were rebels.

14:02.719 --> 14:06.689
I was known as
"Rowdy Rusty" In my day.

14:06.723 --> 14:08.291
For a day.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.459
Well, why don't you guys set up

14:10.494 --> 14:13.963
a rebel booth next to the official
booths? It's a free campus.

14:13.997 --> 14:14.824
They can't stop you

14:14.825 --> 14:16.799
if you're not in the
reserved area, right?

14:16.833 --> 14:18.968
- A rebel booth.
- Yeah.

14:19.002 --> 14:21.804
Like the Rebel Alliance.

14:21.838 --> 14:24.740
Does Luke need to seek
shelter in a tauntaun?

14:24.775 --> 14:28.144
You just hold that
thought in carbonite.

14:28.178 --> 14:30.913
I gotta take this to Cappie.
There's still time to try.

14:42.926 --> 14:44.393
Boyfriend reporting for duty.

14:44.428 --> 14:46.282
Can you take these cupcakes
over to the student union?

14:46.283 --> 14:47.363
They're already late and
I have to get ready

14:47.397 --> 14:48.631
and I don't have time...

14:50.033 --> 14:53.102
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:53.136 --> 14:55.004
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:59.710 --> 15:02.712
- Think you can handle these too, chief?
- Uh...

15:04.815 --> 15:08.284
Da...

15:08.318 --> 15:09.393
- Is there a problem?
- I heard

15:09.394 --> 15:10.920
you told Calvin to shove
his peace offering.

15:10.954 --> 15:12.232
What's up with that, Arafat?

15:12.233 --> 15:13.723
How is that any of your business?

15:13.757 --> 15:15.725
Because I'm the one that
blew the truce, not Calvin.

15:15.759 --> 15:17.793
He was just trying to do
right by your stupid frat.

15:17.828 --> 15:19.562
Well, look,
you obviously have no idea

15:19.563 --> 15:21.297
how fraternities work.

15:21.331 --> 15:22.623
It wasn't his role to do that,

15:22.624 --> 15:24.734
especially when you screw
over your own brothers.

15:24.768 --> 15:27.087
Fraternities are about
brotherhood and loyalty.

15:27.088 --> 15:28.270
Yeah, you all say that,

15:28.305 --> 15:30.606
between your teeth bleaching
and your keg lifts.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.225
Keg stands. And I
actually believe in it.

15:33.226 --> 15:35.811
So does Omega Chi.

15:35.846 --> 15:37.346
At least most of us do, anyway.

15:37.381 --> 15:39.882
Look, the point is,
if Calvin had a problem,

15:39.916 --> 15:42.885
he should have just been
honest with us, not run to KT.

15:42.919 --> 15:43.952
What if Calvin came to you

15:43.953 --> 15:45.821
guys and you still said
no to peace? Then what?

15:45.856 --> 15:46.894
Then nothing. Look,

15:46.895 --> 15:49.792
without the loyalty and
camaraderie of your brothers,

15:49.826 --> 15:53.562
fraternities are just a place
to drink beer and chase girls.

16:10.747 --> 16:11.888
Straight over the top.

16:24.594 --> 16:26.562
Is everything OK with your guys?

16:26.596 --> 16:28.998
Yeah, everything's fine.

16:29.032 --> 16:31.300
So then maybe you
can come by later?

16:31.334 --> 16:33.569
If you're lucky.

16:33.603 --> 16:36.281
My sister's gonna love you.
Oh. Is she here?

16:36.282 --> 16:36.806
Bring her over.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.507
I'm supposed to meet her
by the sorority booths.

16:38.542 --> 16:41.544
But after, for sure. All right.

16:46.116 --> 16:47.850
- Chambers!
- Hi, Trip.

16:47.884 --> 16:50.553
- Didn't think I'd see you here.
- I'm helping out Rebecca.

16:50.587 --> 16:52.521
Good man. Hey, if you're
not too busy tonight,

16:52.556 --> 16:53.656
you think you could
swing by the house?

16:53.690 --> 16:55.024
We could use some big guns at rush.

16:55.058 --> 16:57.927
Especially a former president,
since our current one sucks.

16:57.961 --> 16:59.291
Wait a minute, I thought

16:59.292 --> 17:01.564
the house was working
it out with Calvin?

17:01.598 --> 17:03.032
You're keeping him as president.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.667
That's what he thinks.
We're stripping Benedict Owens

17:05.702 --> 17:08.704
of the presidency the
moment rush ends.

17:08.738 --> 17:09.805
You don't want the house

17:09.806 --> 17:10.873
to look out of control during rush.

17:10.906 --> 17:13.205
It's all about having
a strong public face.

17:13.207 --> 17:14.810
So we'll see you at the house?

17:16.579 --> 17:18.314
Yeah.

17:21.017 --> 17:22.685
Hey, babe.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.788
Nice apron.

17:25.821 --> 17:28.123
Do they make house mom jeans, too?

17:28.157 --> 17:32.127
Yeah, no. This is just temporary.

17:33.763 --> 17:36.732
I guess it's not so easy to
leave the Greek system behind.

17:38.168 --> 17:40.970
- Casey, I need to talk to you.
- Go Greek!

17:41.004 --> 17:42.455
Can you do something about Tegan?

17:42.456 --> 17:43.906
She won't leave Rebecca alone.

17:43.940 --> 17:46.742
Oh, I promised that I
would stay out of her way.

17:46.776 --> 17:50.579
- Rebecca can handle Tegan.
- Not from where I'm standing.

17:50.614 --> 17:52.348
Really? Is that the
best you can do?

17:53.683 --> 17:54.917
- Hey, Case!
- Oh!

17:54.951 --> 17:58.787
- Meet my little sister.
- Oh! Heath and Heather.

17:58.822 --> 18:01.223
Actually, it's pronounced
Heeth-er. Like Heath.

18:01.258 --> 18:02.958
- But I go by either.
- Ee-ther?

18:02.993 --> 18:04.927
Heeth-er. With an H.

18:04.961 --> 18:07.161
She wanted to look at
Gamma Psi and Tri Pi,

18:07.162 --> 18:07.897
but I said neither.

18:07.931 --> 18:11.166
- Right, Heather?
- Well, you will love ZBZ.

18:11.201 --> 18:14.303
- It was the best time of my life.
- It looks awesome.

18:14.337 --> 18:16.772
Let me introduce you to
Rebecca Logan, ZBZ president.

18:16.806 --> 18:18.574
I'm gonna get out of here.

18:18.608 --> 18:20.809
I'm worried about this
whole massage thing.

18:20.844 --> 18:23.279
I just think it's desperate.
Don't you think it's pandering?

18:23.313 --> 18:26.815
Massages improve circulation
and help prevent aging.

18:26.850 --> 18:29.218
You should really
look into it. Really.

18:29.252 --> 18:31.353
Look alive. We've got a hottie.

18:31.388 --> 18:34.623
Ladies, this is Heather,
she's interested in ZBZ.

18:34.658 --> 18:36.825
- Hi.
- Hi!

18:36.860 --> 18:38.961
- Are you a sister?
- Oh, you're so sweet.

18:38.995 --> 18:40.963
- I'm actually president.
- No, I'm from Nationals.

18:40.997 --> 18:43.632
I visit our chapters to
offer important guidance,

18:43.667 --> 18:45.401
which would be smart
for them to listen to.

18:45.435 --> 18:47.503
Although, a chapter can
achieve success on their own,

18:47.537 --> 18:48.904
like when we won Blue Ribbon.

18:48.905 --> 18:50.272
But the tricky part is staying

18:50.307 --> 18:52.074
on top when you have a
president with daddy issues,

18:52.108 --> 18:54.510
whose sophomoric behavior
endangers the entire house.

18:54.544 --> 18:55.651
Or an overzealous National

18:55.652 --> 18:57.313
rep who lets said
sister's past actions

18:57.347 --> 18:58.453
cloud future achievements.

18:58.454 --> 19:00.349
Provided there'll even
be future achievements,

19:00.383 --> 19:03.118
aside from what might
end up on the Internet.

19:07.490 --> 19:08.624
I'm gonna go now.

19:11.962 --> 19:13.495
Well, that went well.

19:18.435 --> 19:22.037
Remember, be sure to be on the
lookout for potential KTs.

19:22.072 --> 19:24.039
Right. What do they look like?

19:24.074 --> 19:26.542
- You'll know 'em when you see 'em.
- Like porn.

19:26.576 --> 19:28.106
Trying is hard, Spitter.

19:28.107 --> 19:29.026
Are you sure we shouldn't have

19:29.027 --> 19:29.945
just stuck with karmic synergy?

19:29.980 --> 19:32.181
That won't cut it this year, Beav.

19:40.557 --> 19:42.825
Hey, look, even Timmy's
getting into it.

19:42.859 --> 19:46.128
Cap. It's working!

19:46.162 --> 19:48.964
Omega Chi can kiss
my inflatable ass!

19:48.999 --> 19:52.668
Welcome.

19:52.702 --> 19:56.672
- Wow.
- Put your old Herbie Hancock on there.

19:59.876 --> 20:02.177
- Cap.
- Yeah. What?

20:03.947 --> 20:05.881
Uh... Um...

20:05.915 --> 20:08.951
Uh... Shut it down!

20:08.985 --> 20:11.353
- Shut it down!
- Now! Now!

20:13.456 --> 20:16.425
Unplug it!

20:16.459 --> 20:19.194
It's gonna blow!

20:23.533 --> 20:26.935
- Timmy!
- No, no, no!

20:34.544 --> 20:35.944
Rush Kappa Tau.

20:42.835 --> 20:45.154
So how about that rally?

20:45.155 --> 20:47.123
Things got a little
out of hand, huh?

20:47.157 --> 20:49.592
Would you believe if I told
you we actually planned that?

20:49.627 --> 20:52.031
Yeah. Instead of carrying
back a whole booth,

20:52.032 --> 20:54.330
I just have to carry
back this sack of ash.

20:54.365 --> 20:57.000
I've never known you guys to
set up a booth here before.

20:57.034 --> 20:59.315
I didn't know hot
first-year law students

20:59.316 --> 21:01.537
wear a house mom
apron and a hair net.

21:01.572 --> 21:04.440
I saw it before you took it off.

21:04.475 --> 21:06.509
I'm just helping the
house out during rush.

21:06.543 --> 21:08.054
We're trying hard

21:08.055 --> 21:09.975
to put on our first real
rush of our own this year.

21:09.976 --> 21:11.575
What happened to karmic synergy?

21:11.610 --> 21:13.577
Yeah, I guess it is kind
of a big change for me.

21:13.612 --> 21:14.591
It's all about growing up.

21:14.592 --> 21:18.816
We're not gonna get a big pledge
class if we don't earn it.

21:21.253 --> 21:23.787
You're gonna have a
great pledge class, Cap.

21:23.822 --> 21:26.824
Wait, wait. I thought
this is what you wanted.

21:26.858 --> 21:29.426
I don't want to be the
reason you're changing.

21:29.461 --> 21:31.695
Tomato, Clamato.
What's the difference?

21:31.730 --> 21:34.465
I'm doing this for you. And for us.

21:34.499 --> 21:37.315
But not for yourself.
That's so much pressure,

21:37.316 --> 21:38.969
and kinda missing my point.

21:39.004 --> 21:40.304
So, what do you want?

21:40.338 --> 21:42.706
I want you to want
more for yourself,

21:42.741 --> 21:45.142
because you deserve it for you.

21:45.176 --> 21:46.810
Not just for me.

21:49.314 --> 21:51.015
I'm sorry.

21:52.350 --> 21:54.518
And I'm sorry about Timmy.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.962
Well, so much for us
getting more guys.

22:04.996 --> 22:08.566
Our first attempt at a real
rush actually cost us a brother.

22:10.035 --> 22:12.436
Poor Timmy.

22:12.470 --> 22:14.905
Where is he now, Cap?

22:14.940 --> 22:16.440
I buried him under the rose bush,

22:16.474 --> 22:19.209
so that every day there'll
be flowers on his grave.

22:19.244 --> 22:20.293
And on the bright side,

22:20.294 --> 22:22.346
those roses are gonna
bloom like no tomorrow.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.848
Without Timmy,
there is no tomorrow!

22:24.883 --> 22:25.884
I don't... I don't get it.

22:25.885 --> 22:27.618
Why couldn't we just
stick to karmic synergy?

22:27.652 --> 22:29.954
Karmic synergy never would
have killed my snake.

22:29.988 --> 22:32.356
Cappie was right to try.
It was one mishap.

22:32.390 --> 22:34.058
So we're just gonna have
to try something else.

22:34.092 --> 22:38.495
No, Beaver was right.
We failed. I failed.

22:38.530 --> 22:40.497
We never should have
tried in the first place.

22:40.532 --> 22:42.900
- But you said...
- No, I know what I said, all right?

22:42.934 --> 22:43.590
But trying and failing

22:43.591 --> 22:46.770
was worse than not having pledges,
not having a house.

22:46.805 --> 22:47.430
It was humiliating.

22:47.431 --> 22:50.207
I have been trying and
failing and laughed at

22:50.241 --> 22:52.910
for most of my life. But that's
not an excuse to give up.

22:52.944 --> 22:54.000
We're not giving up,

22:54.001 --> 22:56.747
we're just going back to
trusting in karmic synergy.

22:56.781 --> 23:00.351
- You mean not trying.
- There's a reason we don't try, Rus.

23:00.385 --> 23:03.420
'Cause when we try, snakes die.

23:07.525 --> 23:10.561
Hey, guys. Check me out,
I'm rushing a fraternity.

23:10.595 --> 23:13.030
We get it, Dale.
You hate fraternities.

23:13.064 --> 23:15.899
- So Cappie just gave up?
- He changes his mind faster

23:15.934 --> 23:18.235
than an African Reed
Frog changes sex.

23:18.269 --> 23:19.005
Unlike Evan,

23:19.006 --> 23:21.171
who's still pissed at me
over Mission: Probable.

23:21.206 --> 23:23.307
The worst quest for
peace since Superman IV.

23:23.341 --> 23:24.942
Hey, guys? Seriously, which one?

23:24.976 --> 23:26.310
Seriously, get some new material.

23:26.344 --> 23:28.445
Hey, I'm sorry I roped
you into that truce.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.147
Don't even worry about it.

23:30.181 --> 23:30.736
When you have a chance

23:30.737 --> 23:32.583
to change someone for
the better, you take it.

23:32.617 --> 23:34.785
- My brothers see that.
- How?

23:34.819 --> 23:36.787
Because we created peace.

23:36.821 --> 23:38.537
The Omega Chis weren't
gonna do it on their own.

23:38.538 --> 23:39.289
They're jerks.

23:39.324 --> 23:41.592
- We're not all jerks.
- Everybody but you, right?

23:41.626 --> 23:43.694
You know, Cal,
if you think about it,

23:43.728 --> 23:45.729
you trying to force peace
on your fraternity brothers

23:45.764 --> 23:48.065
is no different than me trying
to force straight-ness on you.

23:48.099 --> 23:49.767
No, that was you being homophobic.

23:49.801 --> 23:52.302
This was me acting for
my house's own good.

23:54.039 --> 23:54.838
Oh.

23:56.007 --> 23:59.410
- What?
- Cal, a real Omega Chi values

23:59.444 --> 24:01.045
loyalty and brotherhood.

24:01.046 --> 24:04.048
Just like a real Kappa
Tau values... nothing.

24:04.082 --> 24:07.117
Yeah, we do.
We just value weird things,

24:07.152 --> 24:10.921
like spitting tequila on girls
and eating a coffee table leg.

24:10.955 --> 24:13.524
I could spot a real KT anywhere.

24:13.558 --> 24:15.559
Since when did you
become Mr. Fraternity?

24:15.593 --> 24:18.362
What are you doing
with my rush guide?

24:18.396 --> 24:20.631
- You were being serious?
- Shut up!

24:20.665 --> 24:22.533
Kettlewell's rushing a fraternity.

24:22.567 --> 24:25.335
Which one of you little
maniacs wants to bid me first?

24:28.873 --> 24:30.908
- Perfect.
- That was not perfect.

24:30.942 --> 24:32.643
- Absolutely perfect.
- No, it was not.

24:32.677 --> 24:34.042
We have always done it like this.

24:34.043 --> 24:35.212
I don't care! This is wrong!

24:35.246 --> 24:37.815
- Do it again. They're tired.
- I don't care.

24:37.849 --> 24:41.018
What is with the banging?

24:41.052 --> 24:43.854
- Sit down. You two, right here.
- What are you doing?

24:43.888 --> 24:46.356
Well, I'm trying to
sweep under this table,

24:46.391 --> 24:49.259
but I'm not getting
anywhere with it.

24:49.294 --> 24:50.861
You could always go
around it, right?

24:50.895 --> 24:52.563
Instead of what? Hmm?

24:52.597 --> 24:53.964
Instead of right at it.

24:53.998 --> 24:55.766
It's a good thing you're
a temporary house mom,

24:55.800 --> 24:58.669
- 'cause you're just...
- Any of you know what you're doing?

24:58.703 --> 25:01.972
Sit down. Next! Let's go. Switch.

25:02.006 --> 25:05.156
Oh, my God! Is this your lame way

25:05.157 --> 25:07.311
of telling me to go around
Tegan instead of at her?

25:07.345 --> 25:08.470
Well, it's not like you're

25:08.471 --> 25:10.547
particularly receptive
to taking advice from me.

25:10.582 --> 25:11.924
Because Tegan doesn't think I can

25:11.925 --> 25:13.917
do this on my own and I
have to prove that I can.

25:13.952 --> 25:16.053
To Tegan or to you?

25:17.489 --> 25:19.890
If you're too proud to accept
help from time to time,

25:19.924 --> 25:22.626
even from me, then you really
are a terrible president

25:22.660 --> 25:24.294
and Tegan has every
right to take over rush.

25:24.329 --> 25:26.530
Tegan is not right
to take over rush.

25:26.564 --> 25:29.299
She scared away Heather and
a ton of awesome girls.

25:29.334 --> 25:33.303
She has to be stopped.
Now, I have this idea.

25:33.338 --> 25:34.471
Wanna hear it?

25:37.175 --> 25:38.709
OK, what's your stupid idea?

25:45.685 --> 25:48.053
- This is everyone.
- OK.

25:48.955 --> 25:50.689
Hey, guys! Everybody!

25:50.723 --> 25:54.092
We aren't giving up,
because I have an awesome idea.

25:54.127 --> 25:58.263
- Spitter, no. Karmic synergy.
- It sucks like stale beerer.

26:00.133 --> 26:03.268
We might have gone a
little big at the rally.

26:03.302 --> 26:05.670
It was ambitious,
and ambitious is great,

26:05.705 --> 26:08.573
but we don't need a
lot of just any guys,

26:08.608 --> 26:10.008
we need a lot of our guys.

26:10.042 --> 26:13.278
You all saw something
special in me.

26:13.312 --> 26:15.013
And Cappie. And Beaver.

26:15.047 --> 26:16.414
And that's who we need to look for.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.617
But we're already in Kappa Tau.

26:18.651 --> 26:21.286
No, no, no. We need
to narrow our focus

26:21.287 --> 26:23.922
and identify 20 rushees

26:23.956 --> 26:27.225
who are real KTs.
Real special guys.

26:27.260 --> 26:30.695
- No, not that kind, Beav.
- By special, I mean guys

26:30.730 --> 26:32.489
who possess that
one amazing quality

26:32.490 --> 26:34.866
that makes them born
to be a Kappa Tau.

26:34.901 --> 26:36.868
So I've downloaded a bunch
of pictures and bios

26:36.903 --> 26:39.571
of rushees who I
believe all possess

26:39.605 --> 26:43.275
that KT "It" Factor.

26:43.309 --> 26:44.809
Beav, check this out.

26:44.844 --> 26:46.945
Does this name sound familiar?

26:46.979 --> 26:48.680
It's Johnny Sandusky.

26:48.714 --> 26:49.983
Son of Larry Sandusky,

26:49.984 --> 26:52.984
brewer of Sandusky frost-brewed
beers and pale ales.

26:53.019 --> 26:55.420
What if he could get us free beer?
Rusty, is this a joke?

26:55.454 --> 26:57.088
No.

26:59.325 --> 27:01.489
Hey, this Clifford
kid has pet snakes.

27:01.490 --> 27:03.995
Maybe he could find a
replacement for Timmy!

27:04.030 --> 27:06.865
- Not in our hearts, of course.
- Oh, my God!

27:06.899 --> 27:08.800
This guy's name is Jodie Foster!

27:08.834 --> 27:09.555
Imagine, we could have

27:09.556 --> 27:12.671
an Anthony Hopkins
and a Jodie Foster!

27:12.705 --> 27:15.006
I could wear the mask and
everything. - Hell, yeah!

27:15.041 --> 27:16.233
Spitter, these pledges are awesome!

27:16.234 --> 27:18.643
But I can't rush them alone.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.679
I need some real
KTs to help me out.

27:20.713 --> 27:23.548
Every year, we take a huge
risk to throw the secret party.

27:23.583 --> 27:24.602
So why not, this year,

27:24.603 --> 27:26.851
we risk it for
something that matters?

27:31.290 --> 27:32.624
Cap?

27:34.026 --> 27:35.293
Can we try one more time?

27:39.699 --> 27:41.600
And this time,
we're doing it for me!

27:42.602 --> 27:43.835
I mean us!

27:43.869 --> 27:45.837
Let's rush the crap
out of these guys!

27:58.217 --> 28:01.353
Abby, do not bring a rushee
water without a napkin.

28:01.354 --> 28:03.021
It's tacky.

28:03.055 --> 28:05.757
Tegan, you are not
gonna believe this.

28:05.791 --> 28:08.393
Julie Beth Gentry
Manning is rushing CRU.

28:08.427 --> 28:09.715
The granddaughter of Grand

28:09.716 --> 28:11.896
National President Mary
Beth Gentry Manning?

28:11.931 --> 28:13.255
How could I not know this?

28:13.256 --> 28:15.667
Word on the Row is JBGM's
in a fight with her mom

28:15.701 --> 28:18.236
and she's considering Gamma
Psi just to spite her.

28:18.271 --> 28:19.905
Oh. On the good
name of Pussywillow,

28:19.906 --> 28:21.539
we cannot let that happen.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.409
Agreed. There she is now.

28:27.680 --> 28:30.499
Julie, I am so excited you're here!

28:30.500 --> 28:33.318
The lineage continues.

28:33.352 --> 28:36.354
What chapter was it that
your mom initiated at again?

28:36.389 --> 28:39.424
Omicron Chapter,
Mississippi A & M, 1967.

28:39.458 --> 28:42.027
She met my dad at their
Annual Steamboat Mixer.

28:42.061 --> 28:45.063
Well, I think you'll find plenty
of tradition here, as well.

28:45.097 --> 28:47.032
And who knows?
Maybe even a husband!

28:47.066 --> 28:50.168
That's so old-fashioned.
And great! So great!

28:50.202 --> 28:52.671
- Husbands! Yay!
- Come with me.

28:52.705 --> 28:54.472
Yay!

28:54.507 --> 28:58.076
- Yes! She fell for it.
- Yeah, but Rusty's girlfriend?

28:58.110 --> 29:00.011
What makes you think
she's up to this?

29:00.046 --> 29:01.213
Well, she looked cute in my top,

29:01.214 --> 29:02.380
and she's an astrophysicist

29:02.415 --> 29:04.049
with a four-point-million GPA.

29:04.083 --> 29:07.352
Which helps with memorizing
personal information.

29:07.386 --> 29:09.921
And Star Wars quotes.

29:11.691 --> 29:15.493
Laura, Betsy, Abby.

29:15.528 --> 29:18.029
Tegan's distracted.
Let's go. Alpha formation.

29:18.064 --> 29:21.366
I'll take Heather,
you flank her friends.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.668
Heather? Hi! I'm Rebecca.

29:29.275 --> 29:31.476
So do you guys do a Matrix
movie night like the Psi Phis?

29:31.510 --> 29:32.565
We've been wanting to do a

29:32.566 --> 29:34.312
make-your-own movie
night with the Tri Pis.

29:34.347 --> 29:36.915
Oh, yeah. I'm down with the ladies.

29:36.949 --> 29:40.251
I was dating my landlord for a while,
but I told her to step.

29:40.286 --> 29:41.886
She tried to win me back,
of course.

29:41.921 --> 29:43.722
- Of course.
- At Comic-Con.

29:43.756 --> 29:46.424
She had this vampire get-up.
It was sad.

29:46.459 --> 29:49.027
But hot. That's
chicks for you, right?

29:50.596 --> 29:53.465
I'm gonna go grab a refill.
It was good meeting you.

29:56.035 --> 29:58.970
You... You know I outed
the truce, right?

30:00.639 --> 30:02.440
Yeah?

30:14.019 --> 30:16.150
I talked to Dale. Apparently,

30:16.151 --> 30:19.090
he decided to rush
after talking to you?

30:19.125 --> 30:20.992
Really?

30:21.026 --> 30:23.661
Well, the guy definitely stands
up for what he believes in.

30:23.696 --> 30:26.598
He convinced me.

30:29.235 --> 30:30.902
All right, look.

30:30.936 --> 30:32.737
I shouldn't have forced
my beliefs on you guys

30:32.772 --> 30:35.673
and I feel terrible. And the fact
that I came to this realization

30:35.708 --> 30:37.509
because of Dale is not helping.

30:37.543 --> 30:39.844
Well, that's how I feel when
you question everything I do.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.747
Um, well...

30:42.782 --> 30:44.649
I guess, sometimes I can
be a little judgmental.

30:44.683 --> 30:47.619
Sometimes? Man,
for the past two years,

30:47.653 --> 30:51.389
you've made me feel
like your evil big bro.

30:51.424 --> 30:54.559
What with Rusty and the
KT expulsions, Frannie.

30:54.593 --> 30:56.461
Come on, man,
you gotta give me Frannie.

30:56.495 --> 30:58.329
You're not perfect.

30:58.364 --> 30:59.357
And by the way,

30:59.358 --> 31:02.734
sacrificing my friendship
with Cappie was not easy.

31:07.106 --> 31:09.541
And maybe I've been
too harsh on you.

31:11.944 --> 31:15.280
I have totally taken our
friendship for granted.

31:15.314 --> 31:17.182
The whole house, for that matter.

31:19.952 --> 31:22.387
Cal...

31:23.722 --> 31:26.291
They're gonna take
away your presidency.

31:26.325 --> 31:28.793
Trip told me they're just
waiting till after rush.

31:28.828 --> 31:32.163
Oh. They're giving me a
taste of my own medicine.

31:32.198 --> 31:34.365
Let me talk to them,
OK? I can help.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.701
No, no. It's, um...

31:36.735 --> 31:38.536
You know what? I mean,
I want the job,

31:38.571 --> 31:41.406
but if the brothers don't
think I deserve it,

31:41.440 --> 31:44.342
then I have to accept that.

31:44.376 --> 31:46.244
I want to earn it.

31:52.017 --> 31:53.284
Where's Dale?

32:05.731 --> 32:09.667
I'm Rusty Cartwright, Rush Chair.

32:09.702 --> 32:10.593
Don't worry, guys. This is

32:10.594 --> 32:12.136
the part where my roommate
drops the cleaver.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.772
- Ooh!
- Oh!

32:16.041 --> 32:17.575
Lame!

32:17.610 --> 32:19.711
Dale, you can't be serious.

32:19.745 --> 32:21.980
See you guys on the inside?

32:28.621 --> 32:32.190
Gentlemen, when I call your name,
follow that weird guy.

32:32.224 --> 32:35.760
- Johnny Sandusky.
- That's me!

32:35.794 --> 32:39.330
Thank you for joining us, Casey.
And nice work, Rebecca.

32:39.365 --> 32:42.901
You probably saved the
ZBZ/Manning family lineage.

32:42.935 --> 32:46.471
Agreed. It was nice work.

32:46.505 --> 32:50.008
Please. Did you really
think I wouldn't figure out

32:50.042 --> 32:53.878
Julie Beth Gentry Manning
was some space plasma dork?

32:53.913 --> 32:56.481
- How did you...?
- Oh, that girl was good.

32:56.515 --> 32:58.516
Until I asked her about Prada.

32:58.551 --> 33:00.419
She thought I was talking about

33:00.420 --> 33:02.287
the Museo del Prado in Madrid,

33:02.321 --> 33:04.789
which I was not.

33:04.823 --> 33:07.892
We only did it to get
you out of my hair.

33:07.927 --> 33:10.094
Well, I'm in your hair, like gum.

33:10.129 --> 33:12.196
And given your recent deception,

33:12.231 --> 33:14.599
I'm going to have to
rethink you as president.

33:14.633 --> 33:17.869
I booted Frannie's lying ass,
I can boot yours, too.

33:17.903 --> 33:20.043
Which means I'll also have to

33:20.044 --> 33:23.808
weigh in on which recruits
we choose to offer bids.

33:23.842 --> 33:25.543
OK, that is insane.

33:25.578 --> 33:29.447
Rebecca may have many, many faults,

33:29.481 --> 33:31.482
but you never gave her a chance.

33:31.517 --> 33:33.070
You were always so
busy over-stepping

33:33.071 --> 33:35.086
and micromanaging her and
the rest of the girls,

33:35.120 --> 33:36.804
they couldn't get
comfortable enough

33:36.805 --> 33:38.489
to connect with the rushees.

33:38.524 --> 33:40.825
Or recruits. Whatever.

33:40.859 --> 33:42.202
I'm trying to preserve

33:42.203 --> 33:44.829
your renewed stature on campus.
That's all.

33:44.863 --> 33:48.032
- Who do you think made us number one?
- Honestly?

33:48.067 --> 33:49.610
Casey and Ashleigh.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.803
Well, as Casey,
of Casey and Ashleigh,

33:51.837 --> 33:53.575
I have to say that
Rebecca was my first

33:53.576 --> 33:55.974
and only choice to succeed
Ashleigh as president.

33:56.008 --> 33:59.444
Maybe you should let
her and the sisters

33:59.478 --> 34:02.847
of this house decide which
rushees are best for us.

34:02.881 --> 34:06.184
- Fine.
- Seriously?

34:06.218 --> 34:08.518
Don't make me regret it.

34:08.554 --> 34:11.322
Rebecca, can I trust you?

34:11.357 --> 34:14.292
With all the confidence
you've instilled in me?

34:14.326 --> 34:15.693
Why not!

34:17.963 --> 34:19.458
It's time for the traditional

34:19.458 --> 34:21.366
all-night vote on
which girls to bid!

34:25.737 --> 34:29.040
- I'll just go grab my sleeping bag!
- Actives only, Case.

34:30.775 --> 34:33.710
You don't have a vote. I'm sorry.

34:46.358 --> 34:48.359
How you doing?

34:53.947 --> 34:55.132
Hey, Cappie.

34:55.167 --> 34:56.434
There's another rushee
I'd like you to meet.

34:56.435 --> 34:57.702
He's a real "Get."

34:57.736 --> 35:01.339
Yeah? Daley's rushing?

35:01.373 --> 35:03.841
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around it, too.

35:03.876 --> 35:05.060
Sorry about creating

35:05.061 --> 35:06.978
that whole U-SAG
thing to destroy you.

35:07.012 --> 35:08.474
I guess I want to belong to

35:08.475 --> 35:11.182
something bigger than me,
you know? And get girls.

35:11.216 --> 35:14.318
Well, I'm definitely bigger than you,
and I get a lot of girls.

35:19.591 --> 35:21.192
Hey, Anthony.

35:22.928 --> 35:24.462
I don't remember him
from the photos.

35:24.496 --> 35:26.898
- Me neither, but he's a legacy.
- Then of course he's in,

35:26.932 --> 35:28.700
so you don't need to
devote your energy to him.

35:30.736 --> 35:33.337
- Ah!
- Trying's pretty cool, huh?

35:33.372 --> 35:35.373
That's my little
after-school special.

35:35.407 --> 35:36.708
I'd rush you all over again.

35:36.742 --> 35:38.209
- Ah!
- Hey!

35:38.243 --> 35:39.377
It's like Christmas Eve!

35:39.411 --> 35:41.212
I can't wait to wake up
and unwrap my pledges!

35:41.246 --> 35:42.708
You did it, Rus. We stand at

35:42.709 --> 35:45.216
the precipice of our
greatest pledge class ever.

35:48.620 --> 35:52.457
Looks like we got
ourselves a shindiggy.

35:52.491 --> 35:53.866
You guys know the rules.

35:53.867 --> 35:56.360
No parties with booze
during Rush Week.

35:56.395 --> 35:58.996
Huckabees! No,
of course we know that.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.384
No, this is a dry soiree.

36:00.385 --> 36:02.767
Can I get you a Roy Rogers?
Extra grenadine?

36:02.801 --> 36:05.570
Yes, thank you.
I got a call that Kappa Tau...

36:05.604 --> 36:10.174
Move! I got a call that Kappa
Tau was violating dry rush.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.777
Looks like my intel was sound.

36:12.811 --> 36:15.713
Everybody, out! This
party's just a hazy memory.

36:19.651 --> 36:22.787
- What does this mean?
- Nothing good.

36:25.347 --> 36:28.015
I love Heather! She's totally
gonna be in my wedding!

36:28.883 --> 36:32.586
Recruitment is going so well.

36:37.826 --> 36:39.138
Isn't it kind of sad that

36:39.139 --> 36:42.474
you're all excited and you can't
be a part of this anymore?

36:42.731 --> 36:46.978
Wow. OK. I'm not
reliving my glory days.

36:47.002 --> 36:51.492
My job is to teach the
girls to carry on ZBZ

36:51.493 --> 36:53.941
in a way that is meaningful.

36:55.050 --> 36:56.651
But how do you enjoy that?

36:56.940 --> 37:00.601
I don't want to be
some sad older girl

37:00.611 --> 37:02.211
who invests everything
in the sorority.

37:02.646 --> 37:04.480
I didn't mean you.

37:05.349 --> 37:08.253
- I still care about ZBZ.
- Obviously.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.219
And I'm not ashamed to admit it.

37:11.121 --> 37:15.162
I just don't know how
to care the right way.

37:15.163 --> 37:15.831
I don't know how I'm gonna

37:15.832 --> 37:18.192
walk by this house
every day of law school

37:18.193 --> 37:20.046
knowing I can't be a
part of it anymore,

37:20.047 --> 37:22.567
and that kills me.

37:23.587 --> 37:26.388
Casey, why do you
think I took this job?

37:27.691 --> 37:32.499
It's my way of staying a part
of this world that I care about,

37:32.867 --> 37:36.770
but... I'm not

37:37.305 --> 37:39.114
a sorority girl anymore.

37:39.115 --> 37:41.353
- You're the mentor.
- Yes!

37:41.354 --> 37:44.622
Which means I'm the bitch
that everybody hates,

37:44.623 --> 37:47.271
but riding the girls makes
them better sisters.

37:47.557 --> 37:49.311
Oh, so the whole French water thing

37:49.312 --> 37:50.552
is just to keep us on our toes?

37:50.760 --> 37:54.279
No! I freakin' like French water.
Is that a problem?

37:54.280 --> 37:57.785
Look, maybe I overstepped a bit,
but that's 'cause

37:57.786 --> 38:00.153
I'm constantly aware of
this everywhere I go.

38:00.154 --> 38:01.296
I go to a cocktail party and

38:01.297 --> 38:04.114
someone doesn't bring me
a napkin with my drink,

38:04.258 --> 38:07.368
I want to kill them.
Why? Because it's simple.

38:07.728 --> 38:09.412
I do this crap because

38:09.413 --> 38:11.097
it has made me... - A single woman?

38:11.766 --> 38:13.567
I was gonna say "Successful."

38:14.802 --> 38:18.438
I just want ZBZ to be
the best that it can be.

38:18.773 --> 38:20.774
It's my job.

38:26.547 --> 38:29.579
This sucks. One secret party,

38:29.580 --> 38:31.084
and now we can't have
any pledges this year.

38:31.986 --> 38:34.516
- Thank you, IFC.
- More like Omega Chi.

38:34.517 --> 38:36.107
No. You think they ratted us out?

38:36.231 --> 38:38.018
- Evan's done it before.
- I'm just gonna say

38:38.019 --> 38:39.485
what we're all thinking.

38:39.953 --> 38:41.087
You were right, Cap.

38:41.922 --> 38:43.456
We should have stuck
with karmic synergy.

38:44.424 --> 38:46.892
We lost all our real KT pledges,
now we're broke.

38:47.727 --> 38:50.571
- What a waste.
- No, it wasn't a waste.

38:50.572 --> 38:53.440
Because now I know
what a real KT is.

38:53.975 --> 38:55.476
You're a real KT, Rus,

38:56.111 --> 38:58.554
and real KTs never give up.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.914
- The entire school's laughing at us.
- So what?

39:01.883 --> 39:03.716
Spitter's been laughed
at most of his life.

39:03.818 --> 39:05.866
His words, not mine.
And he never gave up.

39:06.354 --> 39:07.321
That's Rusty's special thing.

39:07.322 --> 39:09.450
That's what makes
him such a great KT.

39:09.657 --> 39:13.160
- That and his ungodly IQ.
- So, what do we do now?

39:13.762 --> 39:15.020
We can't have any pledges.

39:15.296 --> 39:19.116
Hey. Um, sorry. I just came
by to check on my rush status,

39:19.367 --> 39:20.822
but, uh, from the sounds of it...

39:21.269 --> 39:23.103
- Who are you?
- I'm Peter Parkes.

39:23.638 --> 39:24.705
My dad's Lasker Parkes.

39:26.274 --> 39:28.678
- Inventor of Joshua Whopper?
- The software guru?

39:28.810 --> 39:31.670
Yep, that's my dad.
He's gonna be really disappointed

39:31.671 --> 39:33.055
when he finds out you
can't have any pledges.

39:33.056 --> 39:36.727
Actually, IFC can't stop
us from bidding a legacy.

39:36.728 --> 39:37.960
National rules supersede them.

39:37.961 --> 39:40.448
Did I hear his name
was Peter Parkes?

39:40.498 --> 39:43.567
- Like Peter Parker?
- We can call him Peter Porker!

39:44.102 --> 39:46.583
Or... Pledge Spider-Man.

39:46.905 --> 39:49.780
Oh, yeah! Dude,
your third sequel sucked.

39:49.908 --> 39:50.974
You know what? Here.

39:52.410 --> 39:54.080
Here you go. Here's your bid,

39:54.081 --> 39:56.680
and our dues have
gone up quite a bit.

39:56.681 --> 40:00.684
- But welcome to KT.
- To Pledge Spidey.

40:01.353 --> 40:03.854
A new hope!

40:06.691 --> 40:09.634
Interesting plan last night.
How'd you come up with it?

40:09.635 --> 40:12.727
Oh, a little gem from
Frannie's playbook last rush.

40:12.728 --> 40:15.330
I guess Crazy had her moments.

40:19.201 --> 40:20.869
Thanks for the help.

40:21.971 --> 40:23.771
Well, Rebecca,
there's still the issue

40:24.406 --> 40:25.921
of a permanent house mother.

40:25.922 --> 40:29.272
And I advise, strongly,
that you consider...

40:29.273 --> 40:33.743
- Casey, right?
- As permanent house mother?

40:34.244 --> 40:36.312
Free room and board.

40:41.051 --> 40:42.952
Thanks for the offer, but...

40:43.620 --> 40:45.331
I think it's a good idea, Tegan.

40:45.422 --> 40:48.591
Casey can have the job,
if she wants it.

40:50.093 --> 40:53.162
Well, I...

40:53.497 --> 40:54.397
...accept.

40:55.198 --> 40:58.567
Congrats, Casey. And welcome back.

40:59.603 --> 41:01.304
Ta-ta, ladies.

41:02.572 --> 41:05.551
Wow, you accepted the offer.

41:06.109 --> 41:07.393
I thought you'd be all, blah, blah,

41:07.394 --> 41:08.577
angst, angst, "I've moved on."

41:08.578 --> 41:10.441
Well, I have moved on.

41:11.113 --> 41:12.390
I mean, don't get me wrong,

41:12.391 --> 41:14.116
I had a great time with
you last night, but...

41:14.117 --> 41:15.042
- Were we on a date?
- I

41:15.043 --> 41:17.386
can't believe you thought
it was a great idea.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.569
- I said "Good idea."
- Huh.

41:19.922 --> 41:21.296
And you're better
than the alternatives.

41:21.324 --> 41:24.136
Well, if you need
anything else from me,

41:24.260 --> 41:26.975
like advice or free
legal counsel...

41:26.976 --> 41:29.811
Nope. Stay out of my way.

41:53.369 --> 41:56.270
- Hey, Evan.
- Hey, Evan. Good to see you.

41:58.474 --> 42:00.208
- Oh!
- Hey!

42:01.310 --> 42:02.808
You're relaxed. The guys are cool?

42:03.078 --> 42:05.273
Yeah. They let me resign
to avoid impeachment,

42:05.274 --> 42:07.809
which was nice, I guess.

42:07.916 --> 42:10.080
It's gonna take some time to
get back in their good graces,

42:10.081 --> 42:11.581
but I'm working on it.

42:11.854 --> 42:14.622
Come on. Hey.
Let's bid these goats.

42:15.157 --> 42:16.391
Wait, we're missing one.

42:16.892 --> 42:18.326
No, I'm here!

42:19.795 --> 42:20.908
- Dale?
- What are you doing here?

42:20.909 --> 42:22.008
Picking the number one house.

42:22.409 --> 42:23.676
Congratulations.

42:25.579 --> 42:26.846
They gave Dale a bid?

42:28.115 --> 42:29.983
Wow. I guess he does
have a better grasp

42:29.984 --> 42:31.851
on brotherhood than me.

42:34.555 --> 42:37.790
I cannot wait to see how
Rusty takes this news.

42:39.159 --> 42:40.750
Oh, by the way, I was thinking,

42:41.295 --> 42:42.612
I bet if you were the one

42:42.613 --> 42:44.709
who called the cops
on KT's rush party,

42:45.365 --> 42:46.677
it'd be a pretty effective way

42:46.678 --> 42:49.390
to get back in our
guys' good graces.

42:49.391 --> 42:51.668
It wasn't me. I thought it was you

42:51.669 --> 42:52.750
trying to save my presidency.

42:53.094 --> 42:56.964
No. You made it clear you
weren't fighting for it.

42:59.701 --> 43:01.369
