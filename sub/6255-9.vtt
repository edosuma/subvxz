WEBVTT

00:02.130 --> 00:05.066
Testimony continues for the
fifth day in the trial

00:05.067 --> 00:07.302
of former soccer star
Peter Kidman.

00:07.336 --> 00:09.103
I don't think
Dr. Brennan would like us

00:09.138 --> 00:11.139
to be watching TV at work.
She's a juror.

00:11.173 --> 00:12.307
She wouldn't mind.

00:12.341 --> 00:13.641
HODGINS:
We I.D.'d these remains.

00:13.676 --> 00:14.709
Cause of death
was accidental,

00:14.743 --> 00:16.611
so we have nothing
more to do.

00:16.645 --> 00:17.612
There's the bastard.

00:17.646 --> 00:19.214
DAISY:
Look at how smug he is.

00:19.248 --> 00:20.281
Not for long.

00:20.316 --> 00:21.316
Brennan will put him away.

00:21.350 --> 00:22.684
You got that right.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.385
Not from what I've seen.
I agree with you.

00:24.420 --> 00:25.420
What are you
talking about?

00:25.454 --> 00:26.521
Kidman was found
with the body.

00:26.555 --> 00:27.856
The knife was one
of his.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.591
And yet there's not one
forensic clue

00:29.625 --> 00:30.892
linking him to the crime.

00:30.926 --> 00:32.527
Dr. Brennan needs facts,
not suppositions.

00:32.561 --> 00:34.829
His wife found out
that he was cheating

00:34.864 --> 00:36.030
and threatened to leave him.

00:36.065 --> 00:37.225
And that's why he killed her.

00:37.233 --> 00:38.533
As Dr. B would say,
"Not evidence."

00:38.567 --> 00:39.901
HODGINS:
Be patient.

00:39.935 --> 00:42.604
The prosecution says
they got the smoking gun.

00:42.638 --> 00:45.240
Then I'll believe Dr. Brennan
will vote to convict

00:45.274 --> 00:46.341
when I see that smoke.

00:46.375 --> 00:47.976
HODGINS: He's just a rich,
entitled athlete

00:48.010 --> 00:49.477
who's always gotten everything
he's always wanted,

00:49.512 --> 00:51.713
and now he thinks
he can get away with murder.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.787
I'm sorry, but Brennan
is not gonna let that happen.

00:53.816 --> 00:54.949
(text alert sounds)

00:54.984 --> 00:56.818
Oh, I hate to break up
the party,

00:56.852 --> 00:58.920
but we got a body
coming in.

00:58.954 --> 01:00.955
DAISY:
I'll get the platform ready.

01:06.529 --> 01:10.265
My brother's not a murderer.
He loved Charlene.

01:10.299 --> 01:13.835
Yet when you were at dinner
with Mr. Kidman and Charlene,

01:13.869 --> 01:16.271
they were arguing.

01:16.305 --> 01:19.741
Charlene walked out
of the restaurant, didn't she?

01:19.775 --> 01:20.775
Yes. But everyone argues.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.043
It never ever got physical
between them.

01:22.077 --> 01:24.045
PROSECUTOR: Until she was found
stabbed to death

01:24.079 --> 01:25.647
with one of
their kitchen knives.

01:25.681 --> 01:27.282
Objection.
Argumentative.

01:27.316 --> 01:28.583
Very. Sustained.

01:28.617 --> 01:30.785
He called the police
right away.

01:30.819 --> 01:32.453
He called me.

01:32.488 --> 01:33.855
He called
his best friend Frank.

01:33.889 --> 01:35.390
Would a murderer do that?

01:35.424 --> 01:37.959
I'll ask the questions, Ms. Kidman.
He loved Charlene.

01:37.993 --> 01:40.461
He was still holding her when
I got there. He was crying.

01:40.496 --> 01:42.163
No more, Ms. Kidman.
Just answer the questions.

01:42.197 --> 01:43.197
Someone broke in!

01:43.232 --> 01:44.499
Even the police said so!

01:44.533 --> 01:45.633
Your Honor...

01:45.668 --> 01:47.769
That's enough,
Ms. Kidman!

01:47.803 --> 01:49.437
When you walked in,
your brother was

01:49.471 --> 01:52.440
covered in Charlene's blood,
wasn't he?

01:52.474 --> 01:54.709
(voice breaks):
He was holding her.

01:54.743 --> 01:56.778
Yes or no?

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:05.454 --> 02:07.288
(sobs) Yes.

02:11.393 --> 02:13.494
But I know Peter.

02:13.529 --> 02:16.064
And I know, I know
he loved Charlene,

02:16.098 --> 02:18.733
and he could never kill her!

02:22.537 --> 02:26.173
BRENNAN: <i>I just want to check in</i>
<i>at the lab, see if I'm needed.</i>

02:26.208 --> 02:28.843
I thought Daisy was covering for you.
She is.

02:28.877 --> 02:30.277
That's why
I want to check in.

02:30.312 --> 02:32.012
You could take
a little break, you know?

02:32.047 --> 02:35.416
I mean, a trial,
a trial is exhausting.

02:35.450 --> 02:38.385
I know. That's why I want
something to clear my mind.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.154
From the murder trial.
Yes.

02:40.188 --> 02:42.323
Right. Okay, so you're gonna
go look at a murder victim?

02:42.357 --> 02:44.992
Ah, come on. I could give
you a massage or something.

02:45.026 --> 02:47.261
That something could be nice.

02:47.295 --> 02:49.663
I'll be home for dinner,
I promise.

02:49.698 --> 02:52.166
You promise?
Promise.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.936
So you think that
Kidman's going down?

02:55.971 --> 02:57.805
You know I'm not allowed
to discuss the case.

02:57.839 --> 03:00.241
I get it. I just hate
the guy. Really hate him.

03:00.275 --> 03:02.176
Murder is bad enough,
but soccer?

03:02.210 --> 03:03.677
That's anti-American.

03:03.712 --> 03:05.779
(chuckles)

03:05.814 --> 03:09.283
I will definitely take you up
on that massage after dinner.

03:17.292 --> 03:18.459
I hate water bodies.

03:18.493 --> 03:19.593
DAISY:
What's this fabric?

03:19.628 --> 03:20.794
It's sticking
to the bones.

03:20.829 --> 03:22.496
Yeah, it's some kind
of synthetic polymer.

03:22.531 --> 03:23.664
Maybe it's a jogging suit.

03:23.698 --> 03:24.732
No, it's too
heavy-duty.

03:24.766 --> 03:26.734
And who who would jog
in black socks?

03:26.768 --> 03:29.603
HODGINS: Ugh, it looks like leftovers
from a sea critter buffet.

03:29.638 --> 03:31.071
DAISY:
Not much face left.

03:31.106 --> 03:33.741
Dr. B!
How's the trial going?

03:33.775 --> 03:36.777
I can't discuss the case,
as you know.

03:36.811 --> 03:38.379
Can you blink once for guilty?

03:38.413 --> 03:40.447
Let's just focus on the remains,
Dr. Hodgins.

03:40.482 --> 03:41.815
Right.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.017
Pieces of the mandible,

03:43.051 --> 03:45.186
maxilla and glabella
are missing.

03:45.220 --> 03:48.055
A facial reconstruction
will be virtually impossible.

03:48.089 --> 03:50.057
You don't have
to be here, Dr. Brennan.

03:50.091 --> 03:51.559
Daisy's got this well in hand.

03:51.593 --> 03:52.693
Thank you,
Dr. Saroyan.

03:52.727 --> 03:55.796
I really do, don't I?
I mean, I hope I do.

03:55.830 --> 03:56.931
Not like you,
of course,

03:56.965 --> 03:57.898
but I try.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.233
If you don't have
the confidence

03:59.267 --> 04:01.268
necessary for the job,
perhaps I spoke too soon.

04:01.303 --> 04:04.638
The length of the long bones
and the sternal rib ends

04:04.673 --> 04:06.774
are consistent with a male
in his mid-30s.

04:06.808 --> 04:07.908
There are indications

04:07.943 --> 04:10.010
of blunt-force trauma
to the front of the skull.

04:10.045 --> 04:11.979
SAROYAN: Well, it could have been
the waves

04:12.013 --> 04:13.647
knocking the body
against the rocks.

04:13.682 --> 04:15.583
Or maybe someone was just trying
to make him tough to I.D.

04:15.617 --> 04:18.685
BRENNAN: There's a fracture of the right
seventh rib that appears

04:18.720 --> 04:20.487
to be from a gunshot.

04:20.522 --> 04:23.190
Based on decomp
and partial rigor,

04:23.225 --> 04:25.960
I'd put time of death
between 32 and 36 hours ago.

04:25.994 --> 04:27.461
Yeah, hatched
trocophores

04:27.495 --> 04:29.930
confirm that he went into
the water about the same time.

04:29.965 --> 04:33.133
SAROYAN: The condition of his lung tissue
and epiglottis should tell us

04:33.168 --> 04:34.768
if he was drowned
or already dead

04:34.803 --> 04:36.437
when he was thrown
in the water.

04:36.471 --> 04:39.106
Beaten, shot,
and possibly drowned.

04:39.140 --> 04:41.041
This is very interesting.

04:41.076 --> 04:42.843
You've clearly been bored.

04:42.877 --> 04:44.311
(phone rings)

04:44.346 --> 04:45.713
Excuse me.

04:45.747 --> 04:47.881
Brennan.

04:50.352 --> 04:53.854
Oh. Oh, yes. I understand.

04:53.888 --> 04:56.023
Okay, I'm leaving now.

04:56.057 --> 04:58.659
They need me back in court.

04:58.693 --> 05:00.894
Now? Why?
I have no idea.

05:00.929 --> 05:03.697
The marshal said the judge wants
to speak to all of us.

05:07.769 --> 05:10.037
MAN:
<i>This damn trial is costing me.</i>

05:10.071 --> 05:12.273
I was closing a deal
on a new SUV.

05:12.307 --> 05:14.008
That's a huge commission.
I was putting my kids

05:14.042 --> 05:15.542
to sleep when
I got the call.

05:15.577 --> 05:17.065
It's difficult to leave
your kids, isn't it?

05:17.090 --> 05:18.212
Oh, God, no.

05:18.213 --> 05:19.346
I was thrilled.

05:19.381 --> 05:21.882
Let my lazy-ass husband try
to put them to sleep.

05:21.916 --> 05:23.956
They only call you in
after hours when it's serious.

05:23.985 --> 05:25.119
Like a death threat.

05:25.153 --> 05:26.387
Who's gonna kill us?

05:26.421 --> 05:27.855
BRENNAN: I've been involved
in many trials.

05:27.889 --> 05:30.324
It's the court's obligation
to protect us.

05:30.358 --> 05:31.825
God will look out
for us.

05:31.860 --> 05:34.028
That, of course,
is absurd.

05:34.062 --> 05:38.132
We have as much of a chance of
Apollo or Santa protecting us

05:38.166 --> 05:41.068
as whatever anthropomorphized
fantasy figure you revere.

05:41.102 --> 05:44.538
I'm putting my faith in
a marshal with a gun any day.

05:44.572 --> 05:47.641
A .357 Magnum beats
a prayer any day, Pastor.

05:47.676 --> 05:48.876
Agreed.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.077
All rise.

05:50.111 --> 05:52.846
Court's in session.
Judge Bruce Cohen is...

05:52.881 --> 05:55.282
All right, all right, Jimmy,
that's enough.

05:55.317 --> 05:57.484
Sit down. Let's get this
over with.

05:57.519 --> 05:59.887
Bad news.
Something's come up

05:59.921 --> 06:01.722
that could affect
your deliberations.

06:01.756 --> 06:04.325
I'm sequestering the jury
until this case is finished

06:04.359 --> 06:05.559
and you've delivered
your verdict.

06:05.593 --> 06:06.794
WOMAN:
What is it?

06:06.828 --> 06:09.663
It could be new evidence
or a surprise witness

06:09.698 --> 06:11.165
or something
the press uncovered

06:11.199 --> 06:14.068
that could affect...
Excuse me, juror three.

06:14.102 --> 06:15.336
Are you the judge now?

06:15.370 --> 06:17.271
Am I wrong?
No.

06:17.305 --> 06:19.239
But putting you
in a cheap hotel would be

06:19.274 --> 06:20.274
very satisfying for me.

06:20.308 --> 06:21.742
That's it.
The marshal will

06:21.776 --> 06:23.877
tell you what you can
and can't watch

06:23.912 --> 06:26.380
and when you're allowed to make
supervised phone calls.

06:26.414 --> 06:28.515

07:05.884 --> 07:07.418
in the high-profile trial

07:07.452 --> 07:09.092
of international soccer star
Peter Kidman,

07:09.660 --> 07:12.361
conjecture runs rampant
as to the reason

07:12.396 --> 07:13.896
for locking the jury away.

07:13.931 --> 07:15.164
Oh, boy.

07:15.199 --> 07:16.699
Judge Cohen has refused

07:16.734 --> 07:18.568
Maybe someone tried
to influence the jury.

07:18.602 --> 07:19.869
It wasn't me.

07:19.903 --> 07:21.863
An anonymous source within
the courthouse suggests

07:21.872 --> 07:23.573
that it's because
Christopher Barnes,

07:23.607 --> 07:26.542
the most important defense
witness, will be changing sides

07:26.577 --> 07:28.911
and testifying
for the prosecution.

07:28.946 --> 07:31.447
This could be the smoking gun
that puts Kidman away.

07:31.482 --> 07:32.749
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, my God.

07:32.783 --> 07:35.785
Barnes and Kidman must
have had some kind of falling out.

07:35.819 --> 07:38.354
Or maybe he just couldn't live
with himself.

07:38.388 --> 07:42.125
Or maybe he was having a fling
with the sister.

07:42.159 --> 07:43.960
Possible that you are
watching this trial more

07:43.961 --> 07:45.061
as a sexy soap opera

07:45.095 --> 07:46.829
than the administration
of justice?

07:46.864 --> 07:48.931
Right. Of course not.
Now, what was I thinking?

07:48.966 --> 07:49.966
I'm gonna go...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.335
Play with your bugs?
Yeah.

07:54.104 --> 07:58.141
My God, how many more
do I have to sign?

07:58.175 --> 07:59.542
Just a couple more.

07:59.576 --> 08:02.078
And this is your salary
for this week.

08:02.112 --> 08:03.980
How much longer
will this go on?

08:04.014 --> 08:06.415
I'm not sure,
Dr. Saroyan. I am merely

08:06.450 --> 08:08.050
appointed by the court

08:08.085 --> 08:10.720
until your identity theft
is, uh, sorted out.

08:10.754 --> 08:12.955
But you're making sure
all my bills are being paid?

08:12.990 --> 08:14.223
Yes. All on time.

08:14.258 --> 08:17.426
Ooh, um, this is less
than last week.

08:17.461 --> 08:19.562
I'm sorry. Another company
put a lien on you.

08:19.596 --> 08:21.631
I thought your attorney
would've told you.

08:21.665 --> 08:23.032
It's not me.

08:23.066 --> 08:24.934
I know. Thanks.

08:29.907 --> 08:32.107
What was that?

08:32.142 --> 08:33.609
Court-appointed accountant.

08:33.644 --> 08:36.578
He gives me an allowance
until I get my identity back.

08:36.613 --> 08:38.080
I am essentially a child.

08:38.115 --> 08:39.816
Well, hey, I'm, uh,
I'm still working

08:39.850 --> 08:41.284
on tracking that person down.

08:41.318 --> 08:43.785
I mean, she is still out
there spending money, but...

08:43.821 --> 08:44.754
She?

08:44.788 --> 08:46.422
Yeah. No guy buys
that many shoes.

08:46.456 --> 08:47.623
Well, I'm glad
she's having

08:47.658 --> 08:49.826
a good time,
'cause I haven't lived off

08:49.860 --> 08:50.993
this little since college.

08:51.028 --> 08:52.595
You know,
if you need anything...

08:52.629 --> 08:53.596
Maybe I could steal
your identity.

08:53.630 --> 08:54.697
That's not
a good choice.

08:54.731 --> 08:58.835
Not unless you <i>want</i>
more money problems.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.336
Ah! I'm gonna be fine.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.471
College was fun.

09:02.506 --> 09:04.774
Uh, do you... do you
need me for anything?

09:04.808 --> 09:06.309
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:06.343 --> 09:09.278
Uh, Daisy was wondering
when you were coming back.

09:09.313 --> 09:11.881
There's nothing like digging
my hands in decomposing flesh

09:11.915 --> 09:13.850
to get my mind off my troubles.

09:19.089 --> 09:24.360
DAISY: I was applying the maceration
agent to loosen the tissue

09:24.394 --> 09:26.462
when I noticed this:

09:26.496 --> 09:29.198
a bullet lodged
in the gluteus medius.

09:29.233 --> 09:30.566
I see it.

09:34.438 --> 09:38.241
Looks like a .38,
but ballistics will confirm.

09:38.275 --> 09:39.942
That makes two
gunshot wounds.

09:39.977 --> 09:43.246
The first wound to the rib
was clearly superficial.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.382
And this bullet was not in
the proximity of any major-

09:46.416 --> 09:47.450
or medium-sized arteries.

09:47.484 --> 09:49.719
Neither wound
was cause of death.

09:49.753 --> 09:51.220
And the trauma to the eplottis

09:51.255 --> 09:53.022
along with some water
in the lungs suggests

09:53.056 --> 09:54.590
the victim was alive
before submersion.

09:54.625 --> 09:55.758
I'm declaring

09:55.792 --> 09:57.693
that this victim was shot twice,

09:57.728 --> 09:59.395
then tried to escape
his murderer

09:59.429 --> 10:01.530
by swimming away.
That was me

10:01.565 --> 10:05.268
owning my position as top dog
forensic anthropologist.

10:05.302 --> 10:06.602
Too much?

10:06.637 --> 10:09.205
Be tough to swim wrapped up
in something like this.

10:09.239 --> 10:11.908
I was actually
just thinking out loud.

10:11.942 --> 10:14.677
I mean, that can't really be
called "declaring."

10:14.711 --> 10:16.312
Okay.

10:19.149 --> 10:23.486
Her therapist testified that
the victim, Charlene Kidman,

10:23.520 --> 10:27.189
was afraid to ask her husband
for a divorce.

10:27.224 --> 10:29.392
Two voice mails from Charlene
Kidman to her husband say

10:29.426 --> 10:32.094
how happy she is that they have
put the bad times behind them

10:32.129 --> 10:35.097
and are moving forward
to what she called

10:35.132 --> 10:37.066
"the next loving step"
in their marriage.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.168
The only other fingerprints

10:39.202 --> 10:42.038
found at the scene
belonged to the defendant.

10:42.072 --> 10:44.006
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Because Peter Kidman
lived at the house.

10:44.041 --> 10:45.741
Of course his fingerprints
would be there,

10:45.776 --> 10:48.311
so would Charlene's. Does that
mean she killed herself?

10:48.345 --> 10:50.046
Why would a burglar kill someone

10:50.080 --> 10:52.448
with a knife
owned by the victim

10:52.482 --> 10:54.250
and then leave without stealing
anything but the knife?

10:54.284 --> 10:57.219
The thief thought that he had
the house to himself.

10:57.254 --> 10:59.455
Charlene Kidman arrived
home early from the restaurant,

10:59.489 --> 11:02.224
the intruder panicked,
grabbed the nearest weapon,

11:02.259 --> 11:04.160
a kitchen knife,
and stabbed the victim.

11:04.194 --> 11:06.295
He then fled,
taking the knife with him

11:06.330 --> 11:07.530
in order to hide the evidence.

11:07.564 --> 11:08.664
PROSECUTOR:
Peter Kidman...

11:08.699 --> 11:10.299
threatened his wife in public,

11:10.334 --> 11:13.002
saying in front
of multiple witnesses

11:13.036 --> 11:16.005
that if she ever, ever left him,

11:16.039 --> 11:17.506
he would kill her
and then himself.

11:17.541 --> 11:19.375
These are the melodramatic
statements

11:19.409 --> 11:21.610
of a passionate man in love

11:21.645 --> 11:25.781
who fears what we all fear--
being left by the one we love.

11:25.816 --> 11:28.451
Every one of you
has said something similar.

11:28.485 --> 11:29.452
I haven't.

11:29.486 --> 11:30.653
Your Honor?

11:30.687 --> 11:32.421
I haven't.
Juror number three,

11:32.456 --> 11:35.224
what you have experienced
is not currently of interest.

11:35.258 --> 11:36.792
Well, he said
it right to me.

11:36.827 --> 11:37.994
I mean, he pointed.

11:38.028 --> 11:39.628
Your Honor!
Juror number three,

11:39.663 --> 11:42.498
will you please allow Mr. Zand
to finish his summation?

11:42.532 --> 11:44.300
Of course.

11:45.369 --> 11:47.136
ZAND:
Thank you.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.239
Beyond a reasonable doubt.

11:50.273 --> 11:52.274
I think when you
retire to the jury room,

11:52.309 --> 11:54.143
you will find
that the prosecution has failed

11:54.177 --> 11:55.778
to fulfill that mandate,

11:55.812 --> 11:58.748
and as such, you will be
compelled to do the right thing.

11:58.782 --> 12:01.083
Which is to send this man home

12:01.118 --> 12:03.219
so that he can
begin to rebuild

12:03.253 --> 12:05.121
the pieces of his
shattered life.

12:05.155 --> 12:07.123
Thank you, Your Honor.
Half an hour break,

12:07.157 --> 12:10.159
then we'll return
for instructions to the jury.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.435
SWEETS:
<i>Trial's over.</i>

12:19.469 --> 12:21.404
That's good.
Yeah.

12:21.438 --> 12:22.838
Apparently one
of the jurors

12:22.873 --> 12:24.173
argued with the
defense attorney

12:24.207 --> 12:25.508
during his
summation.

12:25.542 --> 12:26.876
I'm sure it wasn't Bones.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.150
Hey, listen,
on this new murder,

12:28.178 --> 12:29.545
I got this guy
in interrogation.

12:29.579 --> 12:30.780
You want to sit in?

12:30.814 --> 12:32.248
Who is it?
Ah, it's this fisherman

12:32.282 --> 12:33.949
who got popped
by the, uh, Coast Guard

12:33.984 --> 12:35.351
for throwing drugs overboard.

12:35.385 --> 12:37.319
What's he have to do
with the murder case?

12:37.354 --> 12:39.321
Well, the beach, uh,
where he dumped the drugs

12:39.356 --> 12:42.091
is the same exact spot where
the victim's body was found.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.193
MAN:
<i>Like I told the DEA,</i>

12:44.227 --> 12:45.728
I didn't know
I was delivering drugs.

12:45.762 --> 12:47.229
I just delivered a package.

12:47.264 --> 12:49.036
Fishing not paying
too well these days?

12:49.061 --> 12:49.565
Seriously?

12:49.566 --> 12:51.700
Look, so somebody
offers you $1,000

12:51.735 --> 12:53.536
to drop off a package
on the beach

12:53.570 --> 12:55.271
and you don't
find that suspicious?

12:55.305 --> 12:56.906
I didn't ask, okay?

12:56.940 --> 12:59.408
I'm here cooperating
with you, aren't I?

12:59.443 --> 13:00.876
I made a mistake.
BOOTH: When you made

13:00.911 --> 13:03.212
the delivery,
did you do it by yourself?

13:03.246 --> 13:04.488
Yeah, seems like
a two-person job.

13:04.489 --> 13:06.253
You go in as close as you can
to the beach,

13:06.616 --> 13:07.983
you toss a package overboard.

13:08.018 --> 13:09.418
Why would I need help?
I don't know.

13:09.453 --> 13:10.786
One person to drive the boat,
one person

13:10.821 --> 13:12.254
to look for the signal
on the beach,

13:12.289 --> 13:13.222
toss the drugs, right?

13:13.256 --> 13:14.457
Can you explain the, uh,

13:14.491 --> 13:15.758
bloody baseball bat
that was found

13:15.792 --> 13:16.859
on your fishing boat?

13:16.893 --> 13:18.394
I use the bat
to kill fish.

13:18.428 --> 13:19.829
Like everybody else.

13:19.863 --> 13:22.264
What's going on?
A body was washed up

13:22.299 --> 13:24.133
on the beach the morning
after you were arrested.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.534
We think it was your partner.

13:25.569 --> 13:26.802
I didn't kill anybody.

13:26.837 --> 13:28.237
Test that blood
in my boat.

13:28.271 --> 13:29.738
It's fish blood--
that's gotta be

13:29.773 --> 13:32.675
different than human, right?
You seem worried, Ed.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.276
Funny how that happens
when you're accused of murder.

13:34.311 --> 13:35.644
BOOTH: I'm-I'm thinking
maybe he's getting

13:35.679 --> 13:36.912
second thoughts
about splitting the money

13:36.947 --> 13:38.387
with his partner,
so what does he do?

13:38.415 --> 13:40.149
He bashes him in the face
with a baseball bat,

13:40.183 --> 13:41.684
he wraps him
in a tarp

13:41.718 --> 13:44.220
and he dumps him overboard.
No, no, no.

13:44.254 --> 13:46.622
I-I had the drugs, I admit that.

13:46.656 --> 13:48.090
But murder?

13:48.125 --> 13:50.693
You got to believe
I didn't kill no one.

13:52.062 --> 13:53.762
Actually we don't, Ed.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.767
DAISY:
The lipping on the ilium

13:58.802 --> 14:01.170
and bony projections on
the auricular surfaces

14:01.204 --> 14:03.339
indicate the victim
engaged in a vigorous,

14:03.373 --> 14:06.775
repetitive activity such as
horseback or motorcycle riding.

14:06.810 --> 14:09.145
Is this going to help us
to I.D. him?

14:09.179 --> 14:11.480
Is this a test?
It should help.

14:11.515 --> 14:13.149
Why wouldn't it?
I wasn't asking the question.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.284
I was telling you
that it will help.

14:15.318 --> 14:16.852
Do you have anything more,
Ms. Wick?

14:16.887 --> 14:19.555
This discoloration on the femur

14:19.589 --> 14:21.891
is the result of a bone graft.

14:21.925 --> 14:23.759
Approximately
two years old.

14:23.793 --> 14:27.062
So, if we extract
the donor's DNA from the graft,

14:27.097 --> 14:29.064
we can trace where
the operation took place.

14:29.099 --> 14:31.734
And that'll give us the
identity of the victim.

14:31.768 --> 14:34.270
I wish it were
that easy for you.

14:34.304 --> 14:35.771
(sighs)
So do I.

14:35.805 --> 14:38.541
My friend had her
identity stolen, too.

14:38.575 --> 14:41.110
So I just want you to know I
understand how difficult it is.

14:41.144 --> 14:42.811
Thank you.
She lost her house

14:42.846 --> 14:44.747
and her car,

14:44.781 --> 14:47.516
had to move in with her mom,
and they never got along.

14:47.551 --> 14:49.818
Yeah, I'm going to be fine.
I'm just saying--

14:49.853 --> 14:51.120
I have a fold-out couch.

14:51.154 --> 14:52.221
It might be awkward

14:52.255 --> 14:53.656
because you're my boss,

14:53.690 --> 14:56.458
but since I'm leading
the anthropological side

14:56.493 --> 14:58.661
of things now,
we're kind of equals.

14:58.695 --> 15:00.529
Except that I'm your boss.

15:00.564 --> 15:02.264
But you are happy with my work,
aren't you?

15:02.299 --> 15:03.999
Uh, not that
I'm insecure.

15:04.034 --> 15:05.234
You don't have to answer.

15:05.268 --> 15:06.602
Approbation not required.

15:06.636 --> 15:08.871
This is very, very good work,
Ms. Wick.

15:08.905 --> 15:10.439
Thank you.

15:10.473 --> 15:12.241
But I didn't need that.

15:13.143 --> 15:14.543
Sure.

15:17.514 --> 15:18.981
MAN:
<i>Let's vote.</i>

15:19.015 --> 15:20.649
Get this thing over with.
I'm ready.

15:20.684 --> 15:23.285
BRENNAN: We can either do this
with a show of hands

15:23.320 --> 15:24.787
or a paper ballot, but first...

15:24.821 --> 15:26.188
WOMAN:
You're very bossy.

15:26.223 --> 15:27.456
I'm the foreperson.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.258
I'm the only one
who can call for a vote.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.393
Why did we pick Gidget
to be the foreman?

15:31.428 --> 15:33.262
What's Gidget?
Is that some sort of insult?

15:33.296 --> 15:35.831
She's the only other person
that volunteered for the job.

15:35.865 --> 15:38.567
And the most qualified.
MAN: She's obviously not the kind

15:38.602 --> 15:39.969
of person who brings
people together.

15:40.003 --> 15:41.437
She brings discord, and you...

15:41.471 --> 15:44.306
you bring harmony.
Let's mo this thing along.

15:44.341 --> 15:47.109
Take a vote,
see where we stand.

15:47.143 --> 15:49.878
I could die soon.
Raise your hand

15:49.913 --> 15:51.814
if you think Peter Kidman
killed his wife.

15:53.149 --> 15:54.750
So we're in agreement.

15:54.784 --> 15:56.885
He's guilty.
BRENNAN: No, no.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.454
I can't vote guilty.

15:58.488 --> 16:00.089
But you think he did it.
I do think that,

16:00.090 --> 16:01.490
and that is what you asked.

16:01.524 --> 16:03.125
But what I think doesn't matter.

16:03.159 --> 16:06.128
What matters is whether or not
the prosecution proved,

16:06.162 --> 16:09.198
beyond a reasonable doubt, that
Peter Kidman murdered his wife.

16:09.232 --> 16:10.366
They did not.
You got that?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.067
Reasonable doubt?

16:12.102 --> 16:14.003
Yes, I do.
Beautiful.

16:14.037 --> 16:15.904
The American justice system
in action.

16:15.939 --> 16:18.274
I'm missing all my shows.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.542
What do we do now?
We discuss.

16:20.577 --> 16:22.111
Can I ask: Why are
you only known

16:22.145 --> 16:24.413
by a number and
not your name?

16:24.447 --> 16:27.583
Nobody knows my name, nobody
comes gunning for me after.

16:27.617 --> 16:29.551
Nobody knows
anything about me.

16:29.586 --> 16:30.919
BRENNAN:
Well...

16:30.954 --> 16:33.155
from bone spurs
and compromised movement,

16:33.189 --> 16:35.090
I know that you worked
in data entry

16:35.125 --> 16:37.026
for a number of years.
From your dialect,

16:37.060 --> 16:38.627
I know you grew up
in the Florida panhandle

16:38.662 --> 16:40.562
and then moved to Texas.

16:40.597 --> 16:43.399
I know that you fractured
your left ulna

16:43.433 --> 16:46.035
a couple of years ago
and it was set poorly.

16:46.069 --> 16:48.170
Is that all true?
Why don't we just

16:48.204 --> 16:50.439
let her decide?
Definitely not.

16:50.473 --> 16:52.308
We can't be impatient
with a man's life.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.476
This is going
to take a while.

16:54.511 --> 16:56.111
Fine with me.

16:58.481 --> 17:01.183
HODGINS: <i>So, the fabric</i>
<i>the victim was wrapped in</i>

17:01.217 --> 17:03.052
doesn't match the tarps
on the fisherman's boats.

17:03.086 --> 17:04.619
Uh-huh.

17:04.654 --> 17:06.555
Victim was wrapped in
polyester coated in urethane.

17:06.589 --> 17:09.358
The fisherman's traps are
18-ounce coated vinyl.

17:09.392 --> 17:11.492
Oh, my God.

17:11.528 --> 17:13.896
Well, it's not that shocking.
The victim's bone graft

17:13.930 --> 17:17.933
came from a cadaver donor
at Lang Memorial in Maryland.

17:17.967 --> 17:19.867
So you have an I.D.
of the victim?

17:19.903 --> 17:21.904
Christopher Barnes.
Wait a minute.

17:21.938 --> 17:24.772
The witness at Brennan's
trial who never showed up?

17:24.808 --> 17:26.875
Now we know why.

17:32.103 --> 17:33.503
They can't stop
the trial, Angela.

17:33.971 --> 17:35.703
Yeah, but the prosecutor said

17:35.704 --> 17:37.811
Barnes was going to testify
against Kidman.

17:37.812 --> 17:40.046
Barnes saw him with a knife,
and he was going to say

17:40.081 --> 17:41.548
that Kidman told him
that he did it.

17:41.582 --> 17:44.284
I know, but he can't
testify now, can he?

17:44.318 --> 17:45.919
No, because he was murdered.

17:45.953 --> 17:48.521
Probably by Kidman.
Kidman has an alibi.

17:48.556 --> 17:49.856
Whose side are you on?

17:49.890 --> 17:51.357
Look, it doesn't
matter what I think

17:51.392 --> 17:53.159
or what you think.
The fact is, this murder

17:53.194 --> 17:55.195
may have nothing to do
with this case at all.

17:55.229 --> 17:57.297
You really believe that?
No.

17:57.331 --> 17:58.698
But this is how things
are done.

17:58.733 --> 18:00.300
Is it fair that the police
won't look

18:00.334 --> 18:01.634
for the person
who stole my identity?

18:01.669 --> 18:04.237
That just sucks.
And this sucks, too.

18:04.271 --> 18:06.039
The judge can't do anything
unless he's got

18:06.073 --> 18:09.442
hard and fast evidence
tying Kidman to the murder.

18:09.477 --> 18:11.845
He could tell the jurors
why Barnes can't testify.

18:11.879 --> 18:13.113
That would prejudice them,

18:13.147 --> 18:14.914
and the defense
would get a mistrial.

18:14.949 --> 18:18.284
Justice is so...
Unjust?

18:18.319 --> 18:20.854
MAN (on monitor):  <i>Yes, there was evidence</i>
<i>of a break-in.</i>

18:20.888 --> 18:24.390
WOMAN: Couldn't Mr. Kidman have staged
the break-in himself?

18:24.425 --> 18:25.558
Of course.

18:25.593 --> 18:27.494
But we found
no evidence of that.

18:27.528 --> 18:30.130
Christopher Barnes, who lived
in Kidman's guest house,

18:30.164 --> 18:31.631
told us he heard glass breaking

18:31.665 --> 18:33.633
before the time we know
the defendant returned home.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.201
MAN: Why didn't we
hear from Barnes?

18:35.236 --> 18:36.469
BRENNAN:
Not relevant.

18:36.504 --> 18:38.004
So very smart.
Relevant to me.

18:38.038 --> 18:39.706
We are not supposed
to speculate.

18:39.740 --> 18:43.009
We are charged with delivering
a verdict based on evidence.

18:43.043 --> 18:44.444
So you don't think he did it?

18:44.478 --> 18:46.646
Again, not relevant.
Because if he did it,

18:46.680 --> 18:49.616
God says he will suffer
for all eternity anyway.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.985
BRENNAN: No, because there isn't
sufficient evidence.

18:52.019 --> 18:54.888
I don't think any of us,
if we were innocent of a crime,

18:54.922 --> 18:57.190
would want a jury
to speculate

18:57.224 --> 19:00.660
on why a witness did or
did not choose to testify.

19:00.694 --> 19:03.329
Especially if that speculation
led to our imprisonment.

19:03.364 --> 19:04.831
Well, I think
he did it.

19:04.865 --> 19:06.766
I mean, just look at his face.

19:06.801 --> 19:08.034
Look at yours.

19:08.068 --> 19:10.069
The know-it-all's right--
no evidence.

19:10.104 --> 19:11.437
It could have been
the wife's fault.

19:11.472 --> 19:12.972
Oh, now we're
blaming the victim?

19:13.007 --> 19:14.274
I can't believe this.

19:14.308 --> 19:16.643
Maybe she was
sleeping around

19:16.677 --> 19:18.912
and someone else got
jealous and killed her.

19:18.946 --> 19:21.047
Ooh, electric love.

19:21.081 --> 19:23.483
Passion of hearts
stabbed with jealous rage.

19:23.517 --> 19:25.552
♪ The rage of love,
love, love... ♪

19:25.586 --> 19:27.520
You hear me?
You try to make a song

19:27.555 --> 19:29.289
out of this case one more time,
and I will

19:29.323 --> 19:30.757
stab you in the eye
with my pencil.

19:30.791 --> 19:32.058
I thought we had a connection.

19:32.092 --> 19:33.226
Of course you did.

19:33.260 --> 19:34.460
Can we take another vote?

19:34.495 --> 19:36.196
BRENNAN: First, I would
like all of us

19:36.230 --> 19:37.630
to review the evidence on which

19:37.665 --> 19:39.799
we will be voting.
I'm sure you would,

19:39.834 --> 19:42.502
but I'm the foreperson
and I say we vote.

19:42.536 --> 19:44.337
I really should have been
elected foreperson.

19:44.371 --> 19:45.872
I know.
All those who still

19:45.906 --> 19:47.540
vote guilty, raise your hand.

19:49.476 --> 19:51.177
Okay, so just two people

19:51.212 --> 19:53.446
are refusing to follow
the judge's instructions.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.348
Outliers!

19:55.382 --> 19:58.351
That's not a song, just a title.
BRENNAN: I would like to examine,

19:58.385 --> 20:00.987
one more time, why the two
of you feel that it is ethical

20:01.021 --> 20:03.356
to convict
on such scant evidence.

20:03.390 --> 20:05.692
(sighs)
Just wake me when she's done.

20:07.361 --> 20:08.862
ZAND: Is this really
necessary right now?

20:08.896 --> 20:10.396
My client is still
mourning his wife,

20:10.431 --> 20:12.866
and he just found out
his best friend died.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.001
No, Barnes was murdered.
Is that supposed to cheer me up?

20:15.035 --> 20:16.803
Look, the prosecutor said
that Barnes was getting ready

20:16.837 --> 20:18.771
to testify
against you.

20:18.806 --> 20:21.074
What's with the FBI shrink?
Think I'm going to freak out?

20:21.108 --> 20:22.107
I'll handle this, Peter.

20:22.132 --> 20:23.610
Christopher Barnes's
testimony could have put

20:23.611 --> 20:25.879
your client in jail for life.
Chris would have taken the stand,

20:25.913 --> 20:28.114
he would have been on my side.
Your side?

20:28.148 --> 20:29.949
That's an interesting
choice of words.

20:29.984 --> 20:31.417
I mean, most people
would have said

20:31.452 --> 20:32.886
that he'd testify
that you were innocent.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.554
BOOTH: Look, you put him up
in your guest house,

20:34.588 --> 20:35.955
didn't you,
paid his bills?

20:35.990 --> 20:37.557
SWEETS: Which means Mr. Barnes
might have felt

20:37.591 --> 20:40.226
obligated to lie for you,
at least initially.

20:40.261 --> 20:42.262
My client and Chris
were close friends.

20:42.296 --> 20:44.831
After the accident,
Mr. Kidman took care of him.

20:44.865 --> 20:47.166
It's not a crime
to be a decent person.

20:47.201 --> 20:48.968
He's definitely not
being accused of that.

20:49.003 --> 20:51.638
Chris and I rode motorcycles
together every weekend.

20:51.672 --> 20:53.706
One day, we both go down,
I dislocate my hip,

20:53.741 --> 20:56.042
he fractures his femur
pretty bad.

20:56.076 --> 20:57.556
Would have bled out
if I wasn't there.

20:57.578 --> 20:59.012
He saved his
friend's life, so...

20:59.046 --> 21:01.648
he's certainly not
going to kill him now.

21:01.682 --> 21:03.449
Well, unless Barnes
felt betrayed by Chris,

21:03.484 --> 21:05.151
after all he'd done
for him, right?

21:05.185 --> 21:06.686
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

21:06.720 --> 21:09.188
Mr. Kidman has been home
every night during the trial,

21:09.223 --> 21:11.391
which makes it impossible for
him to be at the murder scene.

21:11.425 --> 21:13.159
Right, and I'm sure you
have proof of that, right?

21:13.193 --> 21:15.295
Well, the press have been
camped outside

21:15.329 --> 21:16.930
Mr. Kidman's house for weeks.

21:16.964 --> 21:19.198
KIDMAN: Yeah, ask any one
of those vultures.

21:19.233 --> 21:20.967
They take a picture
if a leaf rustles.

21:21.001 --> 21:23.303
They'll tell you--
I never left the house.

21:28.008 --> 21:29.742
What?

21:29.777 --> 21:32.378
You just don't want to go home
to your rotten kids.

21:32.413 --> 21:33.546
Brennan here
has already

21:33.580 --> 21:35.114
pointed out
that the police

21:35.149 --> 21:36.649
didn't rule out
a break-in.

21:36.684 --> 21:38.151
Dr. Brennan.

21:38.185 --> 21:39.385
They didn't rule it in, either.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.720
BRENNAN: Barnes gave
a statement

21:40.754 --> 21:43.423
to police saying that he
heard glass breaking

21:43.457 --> 21:44.991
before Kidman got home,
which bolsters

21:45.025 --> 21:46.559
the break-in theory.

21:46.593 --> 21:49.128
So why wasn't he here
to tell us himself?

21:49.163 --> 21:50.797
It doesn't matter, right?
Right.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.365
We have to assume
that Kidman is innocent

21:52.399 --> 21:53.967
unless we have
enough proof that he isn't.

21:54.001 --> 21:56.135
The doctor's right.
They never found the knife.

21:56.170 --> 21:57.537
How could he have
gotten rid of it

21:57.571 --> 21:59.305
when he was with the body
the whole time?

22:11.118 --> 22:13.319
Chemical analysis shows
that the fabric

22:13.354 --> 22:16.389
on the remains was
a melt-blown polypropylene.

22:16.423 --> 22:18.091
Not clothing?
No, it's a fabric

22:18.125 --> 22:19.559
used to provide dust protection

22:19.593 --> 22:21.661
on things like car covers.

22:21.695 --> 22:23.162
So the killer wrapped
Barnes in a car cover?

22:23.197 --> 22:24.597
Well, I couldn't
narrow down

22:24.631 --> 22:27.567
the specific vehicle,
but I did find this.

22:27.601 --> 22:29.669
Ginkgo biloba pollen spores

22:29.703 --> 22:32.405
and leaf remnants,
uncommon to the area.

22:32.439 --> 22:34.273
So it might help us determine
where the killer came from.

22:34.308 --> 22:35.842
Sorry, can I help you
with something?

22:35.876 --> 22:36.909
Oh, I came to
bring you this.

22:36.944 --> 22:39.078
It's bone marrow I extracted

22:39.113 --> 22:40.480
from Barnes' iliac crest.

22:40.514 --> 22:42.248
Dr. Brennan will
be so impressed.

22:42.282 --> 22:43.216
The diatoms

22:43.250 --> 22:44.350
could tell us in what part

22:44.385 --> 22:46.052
of the ocean he was dumped.
Oh.

22:46.086 --> 22:47.320
I'm impressed, too.

22:47.354 --> 22:50.089
I can so rock this job.

22:50.124 --> 22:52.158
(chuckles)

22:52.192 --> 22:53.826
Look, we miss you, Bones, okay?

22:53.861 --> 22:55.901
This is the longest
we've been apart in a long time.

22:55.929 --> 22:58.598
I know. Our honeymoon
was far more enjoyable

22:58.632 --> 22:59.632
than jury duty.

22:59.666 --> 23:01.234
(chuckles)
Imagine that.

23:01.268 --> 23:02.368
How's Christine?

23:02.403 --> 23:03.903
Christine is great, okay?

23:03.937 --> 23:05.471
She misses you.
She even kissed your picture

23:05.506 --> 23:07.073
before she went to sleep.

23:07.107 --> 23:09.442
Tell her how much I love her.
I tell her all the time.

23:09.476 --> 23:11.377
So, how are you holding up?
The other jurors

23:11.412 --> 23:13.713
seem to think that I'm bossy.
Well, you're brilliant.

23:13.747 --> 23:15.048
Okay? They're probably
intimidated.

23:15.082 --> 23:16.516
I imagine, but I believe

23:16.550 --> 23:18.217
the justice system
must be respected.

23:18.252 --> 23:20.019
That can only happen

23:20.054 --> 23:21.821
through thoughtful deliberation,
not emotionalism.

23:21.855 --> 23:23.156
Please don't discuss the case.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.058
Who's that?
The marshal.

23:25.092 --> 23:27.660
I can't discuss
what's happening here.

23:27.694 --> 23:28.828
How are you?

23:28.862 --> 23:30.022
How's your case coming along?

23:30.030 --> 23:31.597
I-I can't talk about that.

23:31.632 --> 23:33.066
Yes, you can.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.001
It's just this case
we can't discuss.

23:35.035 --> 23:38.438
I know.

23:39.640 --> 23:40.940
Time's up.

23:40.974 --> 23:42.375
Okay, okay.

23:42.409 --> 23:43.443
Um, I'll see you soon.

23:43.477 --> 23:44.811
I love you, Booth.

23:44.845 --> 23:45.945
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

23:45.979 --> 23:48.081
I love you, too, Bones.

23:54.721 --> 23:57.457
MONTENEGRO:
<i>Uh, according to Hodgins,</i>

23:57.491 --> 24:01.060
the chemical breakdown of the
pesticide on the car cover

24:01.095 --> 24:02.261
indicates that the car
was sprayed

24:02.296 --> 24:04.163
in the last eight
or nine days.

24:04.198 --> 24:07.100
I'm still waiting for D.O.T. to
turn over a spraying schedule

24:07.134 --> 24:09.469
so we can figure out
what areas were targeting then.

24:09.503 --> 24:11.771
Hey! Verdict came in.
It's on the news.

24:11.805 --> 24:13.639
I knew it. I hate it,
but I knew it.

24:13.674 --> 24:15.942
MAN:
After three days

24:15.976 --> 24:17.496
of deliberation,
the not-guilty verdict

24:17.511 --> 24:18.911
was returned this morning.

24:18.946 --> 24:22.482
Barnes has been a longtime
friend to Kidman.

24:22.516 --> 24:24.117
I can't believe it.
What else could they do?

24:24.151 --> 24:26.752
Without Barnes
there was reasonable doubt.

24:26.787 --> 24:28.087
But you know he did it.

24:28.122 --> 24:30.189
I mean, everybody
knows he did it.

24:30.224 --> 24:31.858
It's okay, Angie.
No, it's not!

24:31.892 --> 24:34.427
It-it's like O.J.
all over again.

24:34.461 --> 24:36.362
How did Brennan let this happen?

24:36.396 --> 24:40.566
However, due to the media frenzy
surrounding the trial,

24:40.601 --> 24:43.302
Barnes may have put aside
old loyalties...

24:46.180 --> 24:47.421
BRENNAN: I wanted to convict

24:47.422 --> 24:49.659
but the evidence just wasn't there.
All right, I got it.

24:49.660 --> 24:51.608
The prosecution left
too many questions unanswered.

24:51.609 --> 24:52.125
I understand.

24:52.129 --> 24:53.396
They counted on questionable

24:53.430 --> 24:54.964
circumstantial evidence,

24:54.998 --> 24:57.195
dislike of the accused,
and emotional arguments.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.857
And their surprise eyewitness
never showed up! - Hey, Bones, I...

24:59.870 --> 25:01.337
That's because
he was murdered.

25:01.338 --> 25:02.772
(sighs)

25:02.806 --> 25:04.674
What?

25:04.708 --> 25:06.375
That was the victim
that was in the lab.

25:06.410 --> 25:07.944
Okay? He was murdered.

25:07.978 --> 25:10.602
That's why you couldn't
talk about him?

25:10.603 --> 25:11.114
No.

25:11.115 --> 25:13.149
It was Christopher Barnes.

25:14.451 --> 25:16.652
Do you think Kidman killed him?

25:16.687 --> 25:18.087
Well, don't you?

25:18.122 --> 25:19.689
I mean, what?
Barnes was gonna

25:19.723 --> 25:21.324
retract his statement
to the police

25:21.358 --> 25:22.792
and testify that Kidman,

25:22.826 --> 25:24.160
you know, killed his wife.

25:24.194 --> 25:25.695
His story would've
corroborated

25:25.729 --> 25:27.430
all the accusations

25:27.464 --> 25:29.232
as well as the
circumstantial evidence.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.800
I just...

25:30.834 --> 25:33.069
I'm sorry, Bones.

25:33.103 --> 25:34.303
I really am.

25:34.338 --> 25:36.339
(sighs)

25:36.373 --> 25:39.008
If I wasn't there,
the prosecution's arguments

25:39.042 --> 25:40.510
would have swayed
the other jurors.

25:40.544 --> 25:42.478
If it weren't for me,

25:42.513 --> 25:43.513
he'd be in jail right now.

25:43.547 --> 25:44.714
No, it's not your fault.

25:44.748 --> 25:46.849
But Kidman is still free.

25:46.884 --> 25:48.818
You know what we
got to do, right?

25:48.852 --> 25:50.987
We have got to catch Kidman
for killing Barnes.

25:51.021 --> 25:53.189
That'll make everything right.

25:53.223 --> 25:55.324
And that's what we're gonna do.

26:01.431 --> 26:03.833
DAISY:
<i>Two gunshot wounds,</i>

26:03.867 --> 26:05.268
both non-fatal,

26:05.302 --> 26:06.869
one bullet lodged
in the tissue

26:06.904 --> 26:08.905
of the gluteus medius,
and the other

26:08.939 --> 26:10.840
glanced off the
right seventh rib.

26:10.874 --> 26:12.041
What about this
tiny groove?

26:12.075 --> 26:14.143
The talus bone differs

26:14.178 --> 26:15.244
from person to person,
so I assumed

26:15.279 --> 26:16.779
that formation was natural.

26:16.814 --> 26:18.981
I would've made
the same assumption,

26:19.016 --> 26:20.883
but this has a rough edge,

26:20.918 --> 26:22.718
not smooth.

26:22.753 --> 26:24.754
It's natural, trust me.

26:24.788 --> 26:26.522
I'm taking ownership
of my position.

26:26.557 --> 26:28.558
I understand, Ms. Wick,
that while I was away,

26:28.592 --> 26:30.893
you were the senior
forensic anthropologist.

26:30.928 --> 26:33.029
But I'm back now.

26:33.063 --> 26:34.864
It's not natural?

26:34.898 --> 26:36.465
No, it's not.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.534
It was caused
by the trajectory of a bullet.

26:39.670 --> 26:41.504
The angle of the
injury would suggest

26:41.538 --> 26:44.607
that the trajectory
was much like this.

26:44.641 --> 26:46.281
The bullet would have
severed the Achilles

26:46.310 --> 26:49.145
before making contact
with the talus.

26:49.179 --> 26:50.413
Which would make it very
difficult for the victim

26:50.447 --> 26:51.981
to stand and nearly impossible

26:52.015 --> 26:53.282
for him to escape.

26:53.317 --> 26:54.817
He was a sitting duck.

26:56.119 --> 26:57.286
SAROYAN:
<i>Algae?</i>

26:57.321 --> 26:59.088
Yup. <i>Didymosphenia geminata.</i>

26:59.122 --> 27:02.191
It's a microscopic algae that
only appears in fresh water.

27:02.226 --> 27:04.861
Fresh water?
Barnes was found on a beach,

27:04.895 --> 27:06.028
but he didn't drown
in the ocean?

27:06.063 --> 27:07.096
Well, that's right.

27:07.130 --> 27:09.365
So, this algae
is the result

27:09.399 --> 27:11.067
of the cold water discharge

27:11.101 --> 27:12.869
from a hydroelectric plant.
Now, Angie?

27:12.903 --> 27:14.503
She dug this up.

27:14.538 --> 27:15.872
This one is the closest
to where

27:15.906 --> 27:17.573
the body was found
on the beach.

27:17.608 --> 27:19.842
If we can trace the run
off from this plant,

27:19.877 --> 27:21.344
then we should be
able to figure out

27:21.378 --> 27:23.212
where the victim was drowned.
Okay.

27:23.247 --> 27:25.514
Let's get an FBI forensic
team there right now.

27:26.950 --> 27:28.384
You wanted to see me?

27:28.418 --> 27:30.353
I think I'm close
to something here.

27:30.378 --> 27:30.786
Oh.

27:30.787 --> 27:32.188
Dr. Brennan'll be happy.

27:32.222 --> 27:34.757
Not for the case.
For you.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.726
These are the receipts
from the person

27:36.760 --> 27:39.128
who stole your identity.

27:39.162 --> 27:41.797
Wow, she is living like a Trump.
Yeah.

27:41.832 --> 27:42.965
And traveling.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.167
I can track where she's been.

27:45.202 --> 27:46.869
What are these?

27:46.904 --> 27:47.937
I'm collating

27:47.971 --> 27:49.372
by type of expenditure.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.841
Apparently she loves
going to museums.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.776
Albright-Knox in Buffalo,

27:53.810 --> 27:56.012
Art Institute of Chicago,

27:56.046 --> 27:57.480
Norton Simon Pasadena,

27:57.514 --> 27:59.048
Crystal Bridges Arkansas,

27:59.082 --> 28:00.216
The Getty.

28:00.250 --> 28:01.751
These are all places
I want to go.

28:01.785 --> 28:03.152
What else do you have?

28:03.186 --> 28:04.420
Stores.

28:04.454 --> 28:06.923
Lots of shoes,
designer dresses.

28:06.957 --> 28:08.758
Clearly she loves fashion.

28:08.792 --> 28:11.661
Like me, and she bought
a lot of books.

28:11.695 --> 28:14.797
Yeah, it does seem, looking
at these spending patterns,

28:14.831 --> 28:16.766
that this could be you.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.434
It's one thing to
have my money taken,

28:18.468 --> 28:20.469
but this is kind of worse.

28:20.504 --> 28:22.338
It's like going through
the looking glass.

28:22.372 --> 28:24.540
Maybe she looked
through your charges,

28:24.574 --> 28:26.042
and thought
that buying these things

28:26.076 --> 28:27.343
wouldn't look suspicious.

28:27.377 --> 28:28.511
I was spied on, too?

28:28.545 --> 28:29.979
Yeah, how did you get this?

28:30.013 --> 28:31.374
The police don't have
the resources

28:31.381 --> 28:32.782
to investigate
a case like this.

28:32.816 --> 28:34.383
So I'm doing
what needs to be done

28:34.418 --> 28:35.952
to get a little justice.

28:35.986 --> 28:37.787
You don't need
to know all the details.

28:37.821 --> 28:39.221
But just know that I'm
close to finding out

28:39.256 --> 28:40.990
who did this to you.

28:41.024 --> 28:43.259
Well, whatever you need from me.
Yeah, thanks.

28:43.293 --> 28:46.028
I'm actually kind
of enjoying myself.

28:46.063 --> 28:48.397
We're gonna get this bitch.

28:48.432 --> 28:51.133
BOOTH:
<i>Barnes' computer</i>

28:51.168 --> 28:53.402
shows that he signed up for a
lot of sexual encounter sites.

28:53.437 --> 28:55.898
So you think he met someone
online and got himself killed?

28:55.923 --> 28:56.472
No!

28:56.473 --> 28:57.940
I think Peter Kidman
killed him, but we have

28:57.975 --> 28:59.976
to check out all these,
you know, other leads.

29:00.010 --> 29:01.978
So that the jury
can put him in jail.

29:02.012 --> 29:03.446
Oh, I get it.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.114
This is important
to Dr. Brennan.

29:05.148 --> 29:06.682
'Cause she let a
murderer go free.

29:06.717 --> 29:08.317
Do me a favor, okay?

29:08.352 --> 29:10.219
When you see Bones,
don't say it like that, okay?

29:10.253 --> 29:11.487
Of course not.
Great.

29:11.521 --> 29:12.455
Bones.

29:12.489 --> 29:13.723
Did I miss anything?

29:13.757 --> 29:16.025
Uh, well, apparently the victim

29:16.059 --> 29:17.893
had a taste
for anonymous sexual encounters.

29:17.928 --> 29:19.996
Yeah, he was supposed
to meet some woman

29:20.030 --> 29:21.297
with the user name

29:21.331 --> 29:23.299
"Kinky Kelly" the night
that he died.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.835
Oh, no! The defense attorney'll
say that's what got him killed.

29:25.869 --> 29:27.803
We'll chase it down
and show it isn't true.

29:27.838 --> 29:29.639
Yeah, one step ahead
of that defense attorney.

29:29.641 --> 29:30.506
Yeah.

29:30.507 --> 29:33.175
Do we know where Barnes was
supposed to meet Kinky Kelly?

29:33.210 --> 29:35.344
Hodgins and a forensic team
are out there,

29:35.379 --> 29:36.899
you know,
sniffing around for evidence.

29:39.082 --> 29:40.750
Thank you.

29:40.784 --> 29:42.551
Jackpot!

29:42.586 --> 29:45.054
The algae in the victim's lungs
matched the algae at the site?

29:45.088 --> 29:48.557
Yes, and the techs found blood
traces that formed a trail,

29:48.592 --> 29:50.259
which leads to this pond

29:50.293 --> 29:54.163
made of hydroelectric
water runoff.

29:54.197 --> 29:55.698
So he was bleeding
from his gunshot wounds

29:55.732 --> 29:57.299
when he was taken
to the pond.

29:57.334 --> 29:59.568
Plus we found this rock
on the edge of the pond.

29:59.603 --> 30:03.372
Now, blood and tissue indicates
that it may have been used

30:03.407 --> 30:05.274
to smash the victim's face.
We'll match

30:05.308 --> 30:07.109
the pond water to the contents
of the victim's lungs.

30:07.144 --> 30:09.045
What is this?

30:09.079 --> 30:10.112
It's not bone.

30:10.147 --> 30:11.414
No, I think it's a gemstone

30:11.448 --> 30:13.249
called citrine.

30:13.283 --> 30:14.817
Well, cut for a necklace
or earrings?

30:14.851 --> 30:16.318
DAISY:
Oh! Oh!

30:16.353 --> 30:18.020
Maybe Kinky Kelly was wearing it

30:18.055 --> 30:19.255
in her bellybutton

30:19.289 --> 30:21.624
or nose or... somewhere else.

30:21.658 --> 30:23.359
Dr. Brennan will not
like this news.

30:23.393 --> 30:25.394
It's evidence.
What's not to like?

30:25.429 --> 30:26.962
This suggests that
Christopher Barnes was killed

30:26.997 --> 30:29.265
by a woman known as Kinky Kelly.

30:34.764 --> 30:37.488
I looked through Barnes' laptop
and was able to trace

30:37.489 --> 30:38.989
Kinky Kelly's I.P. address

30:39.024 --> 30:40.257
to a local library.

30:40.292 --> 30:41.759
But how does that help?

30:41.793 --> 30:43.827
Public libraries,
they don't keep records

30:43.862 --> 30:45.196
of who uses what computer.

30:45.230 --> 30:47.364
True, but we have
the date and time

30:47.399 --> 30:48.632
the e-mail was sent.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.334
Right, but without
a specific person,

30:50.368 --> 30:51.368
how does the time tell us

30:51.403 --> 30:53.204
who lured Barnes to the pond?

30:53.238 --> 30:54.705
The security cameras.

30:54.739 --> 30:56.273
I got Booth to get the footage

30:56.308 --> 30:57.675
of the date and time
of the e-mail.

30:57.709 --> 30:59.610
Oh, Angie, you are good.

30:59.644 --> 31:02.880
E-mail was sent
at 2:17 p.m.

31:02.914 --> 31:04.281
Okay, so one minute after this.

31:04.316 --> 31:05.716
Yeah, and look
who's sitting down

31:05.750 --> 31:07.885
right now.

31:07.919 --> 31:10.020
It's Kidman's sister.

31:10.055 --> 31:12.056
That's right, she was the
one who lured Barnes

31:12.090 --> 31:14.658
out to the area by the pond.
Yeah.

31:14.693 --> 31:16.293
Yeah, she loves her brother.

31:16.328 --> 31:18.929
I mean, she doesn't want
to see him get locked up.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.464
Yeah, and if that wasn't enough.

31:20.498 --> 31:22.700
The D.O.T. finally
forwarded me

31:22.734 --> 31:24.935
their spraying schedule.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.937
The trees on Alison Kidman's
street were sprayed

31:26.972 --> 31:29.440
the same day Barnes disappeared?

31:30.775 --> 31:32.343
My client will not
be answering any questions.

31:32.377 --> 31:33.978
BOOTH: You must be making
a lot of money

31:34.012 --> 31:35.980
off this family.
You sent the e-mail

31:36.014 --> 31:37.548
to Chris Barnes
that lured him out

31:37.582 --> 31:39.883
to the pond that night.
You see that?

31:39.918 --> 31:41.318
That's that, and they have
a picture of you there.

31:41.353 --> 31:43.821
Time stamped.
That's you.

31:43.855 --> 31:45.389
We know you're Kinky Kelly,
Alison.

31:45.423 --> 31:47.758
You suspect she is.
We also know

31:47.792 --> 31:49.393
that your vehicle was sprayed on
the same day Barnes was killed.

31:49.427 --> 31:51.262
We found residue
from the herbicide

31:51.296 --> 31:52.596
on his remains.

31:52.631 --> 31:54.565
BOOTH: We also have a receipt
for a car cover

31:54.599 --> 31:55.899
that you purchased
that was similar

31:55.934 --> 31:57.301
to the one that was used

31:57.335 --> 31:59.436
to wrap the victim in.
Your brother paid

31:59.471 --> 32:00.671
all you bills
while you were growing up.

32:00.705 --> 32:02.106
He paid for your college.

32:02.140 --> 32:03.307
He even got you a job
after you graduated.

32:03.341 --> 32:04.742
You owed him.

32:04.776 --> 32:06.110
My client will not be
making any statements.

32:06.144 --> 32:07.645
And you didn't like his wife.

32:07.679 --> 32:09.280
No one was good enough
for your brother, right?

32:09.314 --> 32:10.395
BOOTH:
Look, if you confess,

32:10.415 --> 32:11.582
the prosecutor's office is

32:11.616 --> 32:13.017
gonna be much more
understanding.

32:13.051 --> 32:14.451
Alison has nothing to confess,

32:14.486 --> 32:15.719
Agent Booth.

32:15.754 --> 32:18.088
I understand.

32:18.123 --> 32:21.792
You know, your brother didn't
deserve to go to jail.

32:21.826 --> 32:24.061
All right? You thought you
were doing the right thing.

32:24.095 --> 32:27.398
That's what those tears
are all about, aren't they?

32:27.432 --> 32:28.966
If you don't have a question,
Dr.Sweets...

32:29.000 --> 32:30.934
He asked about the tears.

32:32.570 --> 32:33.737
(sobs)

32:33.772 --> 32:36.073
At the time,
you probably thought

32:36.107 --> 32:37.841
that you were repaying Peter

32:37.876 --> 32:40.311
for all he had done for you.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.748
But killing someone...

32:44.783 --> 32:48.118
it's not that easy when they're
looking you in the eye.

32:48.153 --> 32:50.287
Right?

32:50.322 --> 32:52.623
That image never leaves you,
does it?

32:52.657 --> 32:54.792
Okay, that's enough.

32:54.826 --> 32:56.126
Taking a life must be
a terrible,

32:56.161 --> 32:58.262
terrible burden to carry around.

32:58.296 --> 33:00.764
That's why you want to cry,
and you should.

33:00.799 --> 33:02.299
It's the only way
you'll feel better.

33:02.334 --> 33:03.867
Just tell us what happened,
that's all.

33:03.902 --> 33:05.703
ZAND:
She's not saying anything,

33:05.737 --> 33:07.371
and unless you want
to arrest her, Agent Booth,

33:07.405 --> 33:09.085
this interview is over.
BOOTH: Fair enough.

33:09.107 --> 33:10.974
You know what,
that picture will do for now.

33:11.009 --> 33:13.010
Alison Kidman,
you're under arrest

33:13.044 --> 33:15.479
for the murder
of Christopher Barnes. Come on.

33:15.513 --> 33:16.780
You said this wouldn't happen.

33:16.815 --> 33:17.781
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

33:17.816 --> 33:18.816
Just don't say anything.

33:18.850 --> 33:19.717
You understand?

33:19.751 --> 33:21.118
Not a word, Alison.

33:21.152 --> 33:23.253
Let's go.

33:26.191 --> 33:28.125
DAISY:
<i>I noticed a number</i>

33:28.159 --> 33:30.494
of hairline cracks
on the L3 and L4.

33:30.528 --> 33:32.296
It's a broad impact injury.

33:32.330 --> 33:36.233
Yes, possibly from a piece
of pipe or a large rock.

33:36.267 --> 33:37.634
Or a kick.

33:37.669 --> 33:39.603
Yes, I suppose
a very strong kick.

33:39.637 --> 33:43.340
Like one from a soccer player.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.008
Kidman?

33:45.043 --> 33:48.312
The velocity and
trajectory of the injury

33:48.346 --> 33:50.681
mirror the style of kick
Kidman was known for.

33:50.715 --> 33:51.995
But we're focusing
on his sister.

33:52.016 --> 33:53.584
Kidman has an alibi.

33:53.618 --> 33:55.285
I don't want to hear
about his alibi anymore.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.321
But Dr. Brennan...
Somehow he was involved in this.

33:57.355 --> 33:59.423
I will not let him get away
with murder twice.

33:59.457 --> 34:02.326
We are missing something.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.531
Okay.

34:07.565 --> 34:10.434
Whatever it is, we'll find it.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.841
(sighs)

34:17.876 --> 34:20.143
Dr. Brennan is convinced Peter
Kidman

34:20.178 --> 34:22.545
was behind Barnes' murder.
He has an alibi.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.313
Don't use that word around her.
Angie's been pulling

34:24.349 --> 34:26.382
the news footage of his house
on the night of the killing.

34:26.418 --> 34:28.217
Kidman does not come out.

34:28.253 --> 34:29.719
And Booth said Alison's lawyer
is challenging the evidence

34:29.754 --> 34:31.188
to try to get her released.

34:31.222 --> 34:32.783
We don't want both
of them to disappear.

34:32.791 --> 34:34.291
All right, I'm working
as fast as I can.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.260
Now, the algae
that we found in the pond,

34:36.293 --> 34:39.295
it matched the diatoms in
the bone marrow of the victim.

34:39.330 --> 34:40.636
So Christopher Barnes
definitely drowned there?

34:40.661 --> 34:41.598
Definitely.

34:41.599 --> 34:43.367
And while the citrine
we found at the scene

34:43.400 --> 34:45.636
doesn't match any of the jewelry
from Alison's house,

34:45.670 --> 34:48.272
we did find something
I think you're gonna like.

34:48.306 --> 34:51.574
I already own those in tan.
Yeah.

34:51.609 --> 34:53.377
I'm referring
to what's on the sole.

34:53.411 --> 34:56.647
Blood.

34:56.681 --> 34:57.915
You do know what I like.

34:57.949 --> 34:59.483
I don't care how good
her lawyer is,

34:59.517 --> 35:01.285
Alison is not getting released.

35:01.319 --> 35:02.719
(sighs)

35:07.826 --> 35:09.359
You're very quiet.

35:09.394 --> 35:11.094
Because I'm not talking.

35:11.129 --> 35:13.130
That must be it.

35:13.164 --> 35:14.498
Thinking about the case.

35:14.532 --> 35:15.833
Look, you know what,

35:15.867 --> 35:19.136
Cam found traces
of Barnes' blood

35:19.170 --> 35:20.838
on Alison Kidman's shoe.

35:20.872 --> 35:21.551
We got her.

35:21.576 --> 35:23.576
The shoe only proves
she was there,

35:23.908 --> 35:25.476
not that she killed him.

35:25.510 --> 35:27.277
It's not enough
to guarantee conviction.

35:27.312 --> 35:29.346
All right, look, I know
that you're still upset

35:29.380 --> 35:31.615
about the way the whole
Kidman thing went down.

35:31.649 --> 35:33.784
Also, Barnes was six-two,
over 200 pounds.

35:33.818 --> 35:36.186
Alison is five-two,
maybe 110 pounds.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.855
She doesn't have the strength

35:37.889 --> 35:40.090
to hold Barnes down long enough
to drown him.

35:40.124 --> 35:41.758
Barnes was wounded;
you said so yourself.

35:41.793 --> 35:44.127
His wounds were superficial;
he could still fight back,

35:44.162 --> 35:46.930
and there's evidence
of fracturing from a kick,

35:46.965 --> 35:48.932
the impact of which points
to Peter Kidman.

35:48.967 --> 35:51.168
So you're saying that Alison
went there to kill Barnes,

35:51.202 --> 35:53.303
but she couldn't finish the job,

35:53.338 --> 35:54.738
so what, she called her brother?

35:54.772 --> 35:55.839
Exactly.

35:55.874 --> 35:57.274
He couldn't let Barnes live,

35:57.308 --> 35:58.988
so he went there,
beat him and drowned him.

35:59.010 --> 36:00.244
And the fact that Kidman

36:00.278 --> 36:02.246
never left his house that night?

36:02.280 --> 36:04.781
Somehow, that's not a fact.

36:08.908 --> 36:11.025
This is raw footage
from the press cameras

36:11.026 --> 36:13.431
that were stationed outside
of Peter Kidman's house

36:13.432 --> 36:15.299
on the night of the murder.

36:16.568 --> 36:19.804
Okay, here's Kidman
at exactly 4:30 p.m.,

36:19.838 --> 36:22.140
when he came outside
to pay for pizza.

36:22.174 --> 36:24.375
Now, he doesn't appear again
until the next morning.

36:24.410 --> 36:25.710
Then he couldn't have
killed Barnes,

36:25.744 --> 36:27.045
unless he got past the press.

36:27.079 --> 36:28.846
Yeah, but how would
he have done that?

36:28.881 --> 36:32.417
The media had surrounded
the house the whole night.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.986
The cameras were
on motion sensors.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.554
For example...

36:36.588 --> 36:39.157
Okay, that is
Kidman's body guard,

36:39.191 --> 36:40.725
Frank Finizio.

36:40.759 --> 36:43.061
Can you show me Kidman
the next morning?

36:43.095 --> 36:45.396
(typing, beeps)

36:45.431 --> 36:47.165
(indistinct shouting)

36:47.199 --> 36:49.033
(sighs) Well, this
is discouraging.

36:49.068 --> 36:52.003
Me thinks he doth protest
too much.

36:52.037 --> 36:53.905
That's Shakespeare,
but I don't know what it means.

36:53.939 --> 36:56.741
It means he's collecting
that paper for show.

36:56.775 --> 36:59.711
It's like he wanted the cameras
to film him.

36:59.745 --> 37:00.878
Like, "Look, I'm here.

37:00.913 --> 37:02.747
I'm innocent."

37:02.781 --> 37:06.417
It's possible that Kidman
sent Finizio to kill Barnes.

37:06.452 --> 37:09.721
What time did Finizio
leave Kidman's?

37:09.755 --> 37:12.457
10:07 p.m.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.192
Exactly seven minutes

37:14.226 --> 37:16.828
after Alison was scheduled
to meet Barnes.

37:16.862 --> 37:19.530
It's less than five miles
to the murder scene.

37:19.565 --> 37:21.799
He could've made it.
(sighs)

37:21.834 --> 37:23.835
Hey, why are you
not more excited?

37:23.869 --> 37:27.004
Because.
Because it's my fault

37:27.039 --> 37:28.806
Kidman got away
with murdering his wife,

37:28.841 --> 37:30.208
and I was hoping...

37:30.242 --> 37:32.577
If Kidman forced Finizio
to kill Barnes,

37:32.611 --> 37:34.245
it's still conspiracy

37:34.279 --> 37:36.380
and soliciting homicide
and all that.

37:36.415 --> 37:37.749
He'll still go to prison.

37:37.783 --> 37:39.083
Not without more evidence.

37:39.118 --> 37:40.685
(sighs)

37:40.719 --> 37:44.188
Can you please play
Finizio's arrival

37:44.223 --> 37:46.390
and departure side-by-side?

37:46.425 --> 37:48.259
Yeah.

37:48.293 --> 37:50.294
Okay, on the left,
we have Finizio arriving,

37:50.329 --> 37:52.930
and on the right,
him leaving.

37:52.965 --> 37:54.398
Stop.

37:54.433 --> 37:56.200
Go back.

37:56.235 --> 37:59.437
Okay, in this one, Finizio
has a normal stride

37:59.471 --> 38:01.873
and circumduction of the hips.

38:01.907 --> 38:04.175
And the second video,

38:04.209 --> 38:07.378
his leg moves outward.

38:07.412 --> 38:08.913
His sister needed help
killing Barnes,

38:08.947 --> 38:12.183
and that is how he left
the house.

38:12.217 --> 38:14.585
It's not Finizio?

38:14.620 --> 38:16.954
No.

38:16.989 --> 38:19.090
That is Kidman.

38:21.727 --> 38:24.896
Kidman suffered
a dislocated hip

38:24.930 --> 38:26.464
from a motorcycle injury.

38:26.498 --> 38:28.366
What is... That's
why he walks funny?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.268
Yes, the dislocation

38:30.302 --> 38:33.304
caused degenerative arthritis
in his hip socket, see?

38:33.338 --> 38:36.440
I noted it here in my drawing
that I did in court.

38:36.475 --> 38:38.943
I'm not making this up, Booth.

38:38.977 --> 38:40.812
I noticed it during the trial.

38:40.846 --> 38:43.548
The resulting pain affected his gait.
Okay, so he lied

38:43.582 --> 38:45.016
about his whereabouts
the night of the murder,

38:45.050 --> 38:47.018
and he's got motive,
opportunity and...

38:47.052 --> 38:50.521
The gemstone from the
crime scene, so what?

38:50.556 --> 38:53.024
And that

38:53.058 --> 38:54.692
and this, okay.

38:54.726 --> 38:56.894
So what am I looking
at here? Help me out.

38:56.929 --> 38:58.129
Brooch from his coat.

38:58.163 --> 39:00.798
Brooch. The gemstone came

39:00.833 --> 39:01.966
from the brooch.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.601
I'll be damned; you got him.

39:03.635 --> 39:04.869
(sighs)

39:04.903 --> 39:06.637
I'm not sure
if this would be enough,

39:06.672 --> 39:07.839
if I were on the jury.

39:07.873 --> 39:09.841
This is where I come into play.

39:09.875 --> 39:12.076
No, it's a bump, not the fist.

39:16.582 --> 39:18.983
KIDMAN:
What, you bring me

39:19.017 --> 39:21.152
all the way down here to watch
Finizio go for a walk?

39:21.186 --> 39:23.154
That's not Finizio, that's you.

39:23.188 --> 39:25.256
Okay, my client has nothing
to say to that accusation.

39:25.290 --> 39:27.859
He doesn't have to say anything at all.
You have a distinctive gait.

39:27.893 --> 39:30.361
That won't hold up in court.
Oh, it'll hold up. You should see her

39:30.395 --> 39:32.330
in front of the jury,
and not on it.

39:41.073 --> 39:43.307
I was feeling cooped up.

39:43.342 --> 39:45.843
I put on somebody else's clothes
and I went for a drive.

39:45.878 --> 39:47.345
Peter.
What, it doesn't prove

39:47.379 --> 39:48.579
I murdered anyone.

39:48.614 --> 39:50.815
Okay, so you admit
that this is you dressed up

39:50.849 --> 39:53.918
in your body guard's clothes,
leaving the premises.

39:53.952 --> 39:55.353
Yeah, I'm an athlete.

39:55.387 --> 39:56.754
Can't keep my cooped up
for long.

39:56.788 --> 39:59.056
(scoffs)

39:59.091 --> 40:00.825
What's this?

40:00.859 --> 40:03.160
That was found in the water
where Barnes drowned.

40:03.195 --> 40:05.496
It came from Frank
Finizio's brooch.

40:05.530 --> 40:06.898
Yeah, that doesn't prove
that my client had...

40:06.932 --> 40:08.432
Actually, it does, Mr. Zand.

40:08.467 --> 40:10.067
BRENNAN: You just admitted
to wearing the brooch

40:10.102 --> 40:11.502
two hours before the murder,

40:11.536 --> 40:13.237
when it still had all three stones.
Right.

40:13.272 --> 40:14.572
And this is
what it looks like now.

40:14.606 --> 40:15.740
Bones, brooch.

40:16.675 --> 40:19.443
Brooch, brooch.

40:19.478 --> 40:21.913
This is what it looks like now.

40:25.417 --> 40:27.285
So what do you think a jury
will make of that, Bones?

40:27.319 --> 40:29.253
Beyond a reasonable doubt,

40:29.288 --> 40:31.555
they'll fry him.

40:31.590 --> 40:33.424
I told you

40:33.458 --> 40:36.060
to shut up, huh?

40:36.094 --> 40:38.396
You're getting exactly
what you deserve.

40:44.202 --> 40:46.437
♪

41:13.632 --> 41:15.266
(clears throat)

41:15.300 --> 41:16.867
Hey, they got Kidman.

41:16.902 --> 41:19.804
I know,
and I have something for you.

41:19.838 --> 41:21.539
I found her.

41:21.573 --> 41:23.574
The woman who stole
your identity.

41:23.608 --> 41:25.009
Are you sure?

41:25.043 --> 41:26.477
Yeah, I got the idea

41:26.511 --> 41:28.913
from the public library
security video.

41:28.947 --> 41:31.282
I got the date and time
from the last known charge,

41:31.316 --> 41:33.484
and then I got the video.

41:33.518 --> 41:35.319
I can't believe it.

41:35.354 --> 41:37.621
MONTENEGRO:
We can track her now.

41:37.656 --> 41:39.657
We can find her and arrest her.

41:39.691 --> 41:41.559
Oh, my God.

41:41.593 --> 41:42.994
What is it?

41:43.028 --> 41:44.562
I know her; that's Haley Kent.

41:44.596 --> 41:46.163
She was my college roommate.

41:46.198 --> 41:47.798
We were friends.

41:47.833 --> 41:50.835
She stayed with me
just last year.

41:56.675 --> 41:59.310
I never asked you; have you
ever served on a jury before?

41:59.344 --> 42:01.512
Oh, uh, no I have not.

42:01.546 --> 42:02.747
Why not?

42:02.781 --> 42:04.315
Why? Because, you know,

42:04.349 --> 42:06.150
when I tell the defense
that I'm FBI,

42:06.184 --> 42:07.318
they-they reject me.

42:07.352 --> 42:09.220
Well, why wasn't I rejected?

42:09.254 --> 42:10.988
I work for the FBI.

42:11.023 --> 42:12.590
Oh, because I always say,
"You know what,

42:12.624 --> 42:14.258
if you get arrested,
you're definitely guilty."

42:14.292 --> 42:15.393
You don't believe that.

42:15.427 --> 42:16.761
You know what,
actually, I do.

42:16.795 --> 42:18.129
I mean, most of the time.

42:18.163 --> 42:19.296
You know what, we're cops.

42:19.331 --> 42:20.931
So we have to, uh,
stick together.

42:20.966 --> 42:22.333
So you're saying
that if you were

42:22.367 --> 42:24.168
on that jury with me,
I wouldn't have

42:24.202 --> 42:26.070
changed your mind from guilty?

42:26.104 --> 42:27.571
I'm pretty sure we would've
ended up in a hung jury,

42:27.606 --> 42:28.739
and you want to know why?

42:28.774 --> 42:31.175
Why, because you're so stubborn?

42:31.209 --> 42:33.377
No, because I'm ying,
and you're yang.

42:33.412 --> 42:35.346
"Yin", not "ying."

42:35.380 --> 42:37.014
Everybody says "ying yang".

42:37.049 --> 42:38.416
Well, everybody's wrong.

42:38.450 --> 42:40.351
Oh, ying yang.
Stop saying it.

42:40.385 --> 42:41.786
It's incorrect.
Oh, okay.

42:41.820 --> 42:44.655
Yang thinks it's incorrect,

42:44.689 --> 42:47.024
but Ying knows
that it's right, huh?

42:47.059 --> 42:49.226
That is why we fit

42:49.261 --> 42:50.661
together.

42:50.695 --> 42:52.163
Ying, yang.

42:52.197 --> 42:53.197
Look at that.

42:53.231 --> 42:55.299
(chuckles)

42:55.333 --> 42:57.034
We do fit together.

42:57.069 --> 43:02.069
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

43:06.278 --> 43:07.878
What's that mean?

43:08.305 --> 43:14.616
