_

00:02.680 --> 00:05.128
__

00:12.071 --> 00:13.654
Am I gonna die, captain?

00:13.656 --> 00:15.606
It'll be all right, private.
Do you hear me?

00:15.608 --> 00:17.775
You need to look that
angel of death right in the eye

00:17.777 --> 00:20.110
and shout,
"what the shit is that?"

00:20.112 --> 00:23.747
- Macho man T-shirt.
- A macho man T-shirt?

00:23.749 --> 00:27.117
All right, everyone stop!

00:27.119 --> 00:30.120
God damn it, I told all of you
we need to make this authentic,

00:30.122 --> 00:31.121
And look at you.

00:31.123 --> 00:34.959
Uh, yeah, you guys. Don't
you know what rebels look like?

00:34.961 --> 00:39.463
The only one taking this
reenactment seriously is Dr. Kuzniak.

00:39.465 --> 00:41.382
Reenactment?
What reenactment?

00:41.384 --> 00:44.969
- Quick question, can I buy him?
- This some bullshit.

00:44.971 --> 00:47.888
I don't give a shit about
your cotton-picking problems.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.307
See what I did there?

00:50.309 --> 00:53.360
- I'ma get you for this, asshole.
- Quit complaining.

00:53.362 --> 00:56.230
You're not the only slave here.

00:56.232 --> 00:58.866
Ew. Denzel,
the most important thing

00:58.868 --> 01:02.286
in civil war reenactment
is historical accuracy.

01:03.456 --> 01:04.655
Hold on. It's a, uh...

01:04.657 --> 01:06.991
A call from the future.
What?

01:06.993 --> 01:09.660
Listen, some old woman called
claiming to be your mother.

01:09.662 --> 01:12.246
I said, "that's a cruel joke.
His mom is dead."

01:12.248 --> 01:13.464
Then she got really upset.

01:13.466 --> 01:16.166
- She said she's on her way over.
- Mommy?

01:16.168 --> 01:19.887
Nooo!

01:19.889 --> 01:22.089
Captain's leading the charge.

01:22.091 --> 01:24.008
Let's get them sumbitches!

01:25.678 --> 01:29.563
- Hey, no fair. I shot you.
- Lick my musket balls, yankee.

01:29.565 --> 01:32.232
Four score and seven...

01:33.653 --> 01:35.402
- Yee-haw!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:35.404 --> 01:39.657
- We just won the civil war.
- I told you the south would rise again.

01:39.659 --> 01:43.360
It's going to be just like
the good old days.

01:43.362 --> 01:45.863
Awkward.

01:50.536 --> 01:53.539

02:08.220 --> 02:10.888
- Pat's so funny.
- Connie, where were you?

02:10.889 --> 02:12.556
You missed
the whole reenactment.

02:12.558 --> 02:15.192
Oh, sorry, Ethel.
I've been busy.

02:15.194 --> 02:18.062
Today's the day my lifelong
dream will finally come true.

02:18.064 --> 02:20.647
Connie, they've been putting
cheese in the crust for years now.

02:20.649 --> 02:22.950
No, my other lifelong dream.

02:22.952 --> 02:25.119
Wheel of fortune is coming
to Hazelhurst.

02:25.121 --> 02:27.905
Here, you can read all
about it in The Daily Patter.

02:27.907 --> 02:31.992
You subscribe
to a daily Pat Sajak newsletter?

02:31.994 --> 02:33.460
No, silly, I write it.

02:33.462 --> 02:35.379
And I've been watching
86 straight hours

02:35.381 --> 02:37.581
of Wheel to get ready
for my tryout.

02:37.583 --> 02:40.467
Want to borrow some tapes?
I have every episode ever.

02:40.469 --> 02:42.386
This one's a mix tape.

02:42.388 --> 02:43.754
All love puzzles.

02:43.756 --> 02:48.780
Oh! Time for
me to go camp out in line.

02:48.928 --> 02:51.595
Oh, Pat, I can't wait
to meet you in person.

02:51.597 --> 02:55.149
Whoa, you stink.

02:55.151 --> 02:56.600
<i>Code red, Malloy!</i>

02:56.602 --> 02:59.186
We got to clean this place up
before Mommy gets here.

02:59.188 --> 03:01.355
Here. Let me help you.

03:01.357 --> 03:04.942
I got to clear my Google
history and my Bing history

03:04.944 --> 03:07.194
and all the things
I asked jeeves about squirters.

03:07.196 --> 03:09.113
You know what?
Screw it.

03:10.366 --> 03:13.417
If your mom's still alive, then
whose ashes are in that urn?

03:13.419 --> 03:15.252
Ex-girlfriend who gave me
some lip.

03:15.254 --> 03:16.870
It also doubles as a swear jar.

03:16.872 --> 03:17.871
Why did you tell everybody
your mom

03:17.873 --> 03:19.123
was dead in the first place?

03:19.125 --> 03:21.592
Because she's a [bleep] nightmare.

03:23.379 --> 03:28.515
The year was 1968, and I was
just an average American boy.

03:31.137 --> 03:32.352
Son!

03:32.354 --> 03:35.856
Uh, a fire started on my pee
pee, and I had to rub it out.

03:35.858 --> 03:38.942
I think it's time you learned
about the birds and the bees.

03:38.944 --> 03:40.644
She talked to you about sex.
So what?

03:40.646 --> 03:42.146
About sex?
Uh-uh.

03:42.148 --> 03:45.482
She locked me in a closet
full of birds and bees!

03:48.154 --> 03:51.038
This is what happens to boys
who touch their dirty pecker.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.873
Just because you're a big baby,

03:52.875 --> 03:54.958
you deprived me of a grandmother?

03:54.960 --> 03:58.128
The one person whose job
it is to spoil me.

03:58.130 --> 04:01.632
- Someone is going to pay for this.
- The Jews?

04:01.634 --> 04:03.133
Dear god, she's here!
Quick!

04:03.135 --> 04:05.803
I got to put on this Christmas
sweater she knitted me.

04:05.805 --> 04:09.588
Well, that puts the
"Christ" in Christmas.

04:09.623 --> 04:12.643
- Woodrow, my dear.
- Hi, Mommy.

04:12.645 --> 04:15.429
Oh, what a lovely home
you have here.

04:15.431 --> 04:17.231
Uh-oh, dusty.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.683
You forgot to dust our plant
when you were little.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.101
That's why your father left.

04:21.103 --> 04:23.487
I'm sorry, Mommy.
I'm a bad boy.

04:23.489 --> 04:25.105
Spank me.
Spank me!

04:25.107 --> 04:26.998
Oh, don't be silly, Woodrow.

04:26.999 --> 04:30.744
- We'll just call that strike one.
- Oh, okay.

04:30.746 --> 04:33.831
- Malloy, forget you saw that.
- Oh, I wish I could.

04:33.833 --> 04:38.001
And you must be
my cute little grandcubby.

04:38.003 --> 04:39.203
I am, gam-gam.

04:39.205 --> 04:41.622
Oh, I can't wait
to spoil you to death.

04:41.624 --> 04:43.040
See, Woody?

04:43.042 --> 04:45.876
Grandma's not a horrible [bleep]
like you said.

04:45.878 --> 04:48.128
Ah! 
My little comedian.

04:48.130 --> 04:50.264
Don't listen to him, Mommy.
I love having you here.

04:50.266 --> 04:51.598
Oh, good,

04:51.600 --> 04:53.634
because I was thrown
out of the nursing home.

04:53.636 --> 04:55.802
Apparently when your roommate
cheats at bingo,

04:55.804 --> 04:57.888
you're not allowed to cut
her feeding tube.

04:57.890 --> 05:00.774
So I'm moving here forever.

05:00.776 --> 05:03.694
- What?
- Yay! You can have Woody's room.

05:03.696 --> 05:06.396
- Wonderful.
- You know, you ought to make Woody

05:06.398 --> 05:07.898
one of those "don't touch
your pecker" sweaters

05:07.900 --> 05:11.703
for every day of the week.
He's got a problem.

the puzzle?

05:24.133 --> 05:29.970
Tuh-hee caht...
eyen... tuh-hee hawt.

05:29.972 --> 05:30.921
Next.

05:30.923 --> 05:33.640
Okay. Give the wheel a spin.

05:35.427 --> 05:37.311
- Oh, [bleep] this.
- Next.

05:37.313 --> 05:39.062
Tell us a little something about you.

05:39.064 --> 05:41.598
My name's Connie,
and if I ever met Pat Sajak,

05:41.600 --> 05:44.434
- I'd probably crap myself.
- Uh-huh.

05:44.436 --> 05:45.819
Good job, Connie.

05:45.821 --> 05:47.938
Okay, Connie.
This first one is a phrase...

05:47.940 --> 05:51.024
I'd like to solve the puzzle.
"a partridge in a pear tree."

05:51.026 --> 05:53.944
Oh, my god.
That's amazing.

05:53.946 --> 05:55.445
Looks like we filled our last slot.

05:56.448 --> 05:57.831
Very impressive.

05:57.833 --> 06:00.834
P-P-Pat Sajak?

06:02.788 --> 06:05.422
Uh-oh.

06:09.845 --> 06:12.346
And this is his first day
of kindergarten.

06:12.348 --> 06:14.965
I think we all know
what bus he was riding.

06:14.967 --> 06:17.851
I had to come to school
six times that day.

06:17.853 --> 06:19.436
Because he missed his Mommy?

06:19.438 --> 06:22.139
No, because he refused
to consume anything

06:22.141 --> 06:24.641
but my breast milk
until he was 17.

06:26.612 --> 06:27.978
You made me do that!

06:27.980 --> 06:30.480
You said solid food
would give me polio.

06:30.482 --> 06:34.484
- What's that, Woodrow?
- Uh, Mommy milk is nummy yummy.

06:34.486 --> 06:38.989
Damn, who's the kinky hottie
with the wrinkly body?

06:38.991 --> 06:41.658
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
No, you don't. No way.

06:41.660 --> 06:45.045
- Call me Denzel.
- Oh, my.

06:45.047 --> 06:48.548
Well, aren't you just
the sweetest young man?

06:48.550 --> 06:49.967
Anita Johnson.

06:49.969 --> 06:52.135
Good, 'cause you
about to get a big one.

06:52.137 --> 06:55.222
- You certainly come on strong.
- Oh, I come on a lot of things.

06:55.224 --> 06:58.531
- Want me to show you?
- All right, Denzel. Get out of here!

07:00.512 --> 07:03.146
Oh, my baby's upset.

07:03.148 --> 07:05.565
Maybe he needs
some of Mommy's nummy yummy.

07:05.567 --> 07:06.933
Great idea, Malloy.

07:06.935 --> 07:09.319
Oh, no, no, no!
I had a big breakfast.

07:09.321 --> 07:11.321
Suck it, Woodrow.

07:13.381 --> 07:16.477
Milk's gone bad.

07:17.091 --> 07:19.529
So, uh, what time
should I be here for the taping?

07:19.531 --> 07:22.424
Connie, the insurance adjuster
is telling us the smartest

07:22.425 --> 07:24.868
thing to do would be to
set fire to this building.

07:24.870 --> 07:26.420
Even the soil on which
this building stands

07:26.422 --> 07:29.039
has been rendered barren
for generations to come.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.041
So short answer,
there will be no taping.

07:31.043 --> 07:32.709
Not for you, not ever, please go.

07:32.711 --> 07:36.263
No! I can't go!
This is my dream!

07:36.265 --> 07:38.548
We got a spinner.
Tranq her and yank her.

07:38.550 --> 07:40.217
Oh!

07:43.555 --> 07:44.888
Mommy, listen.

07:44.890 --> 07:48.308
You got to stay away from
this Denzel guy. He's trouble.

07:48.310 --> 07:50.310
Trust me, he eats old ladies
for breakfast.

07:50.312 --> 07:52.896
Oh, you don't need
to tell me, son.

07:52.898 --> 07:54.448
He's doing that to me right now.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.566
'Sup, Woody?

07:56.568 --> 07:58.902
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

07:58.904 --> 08:02.239
Woody, stop.
That's no way to treat your father.

08:02.241 --> 08:04.908
- My father?
- Oh, you didn't hear?

08:04.910 --> 08:06.243
We got married.

08:06.245 --> 08:09.246
I'm your daddy.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.578
Good morning, son.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.380
I hope all that screaming
your mama did last night

08:14.382 --> 08:15.581
didn't keep you up.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.717
- I didn't notice.
- Really?

08:17.719 --> 08:19.485
Well, how about the sound
of my balls

08:19.487 --> 08:22.722
slapping against her big old ass?
You had to hear that.

08:22.724 --> 08:24.857
Bap! Bap! Bap!
Bap! Bap! Bap! Bap!

08:24.859 --> 08:26.576
I know what you're doing.

08:26.578 --> 08:28.828
You're just getting back at me
for the whole slave thing,

08:28.830 --> 08:32.698
- but you have gone too far, Denzel.
- Please, call me daddy.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.166
I'll call you a son of a bit...

08:34.168 --> 08:37.003
bestest daddy
in the whole wide world.

08:37.005 --> 08:39.621
- Good morning, boys.
- Morning, baby.

08:39.624 --> 08:41.039
I'm surprised you can walk straight.

08:41.042 --> 08:42.207
Oh!

08:42.210 --> 08:44.710
Hey, boy, run into the kitchen
and grab your daddy a beer.

08:44.712 --> 08:46.345
You are not the boss of me!

08:46.347 --> 08:48.464
Woodrow, Denzel is
your father now,

08:48.466 --> 08:49.882
and you're going to do
what he says.

08:49.884 --> 08:54.470
- Understand?
- But... Yes, Mommy.

08:54.472 --> 08:58.891
Ha ha! Me and you, we're gonna
have a lot of fun, son.

09:15.243 --> 09:17.743
Hi, Pat.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.051
Where am I?

09:25.053 --> 09:28.337
- Help. Someone help me!
- Relax, Pat.

09:28.339 --> 09:30.589
We're going to be best friends.

09:30.591 --> 09:34.427
You? You're the shit woman.
What do you want?

09:34.429 --> 09:37.763
Ahh.
It feels as perfect as it looks.

09:37.765 --> 09:39.649
Get away from me,
you crazy stalker.

09:39.651 --> 09:42.902
I'm not a crazy stalker.

09:42.904 --> 09:44.487
Just ask Back-Pat.

09:44.489 --> 09:47.606
Well, hello there, Pat.
I'm Back-Pat.

09:47.608 --> 09:50.109
Look, I'm not sure
what you want from me, but...

09:50.111 --> 09:53.329
- Say hello back, Pat.
- I'm confused.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.414
Are you telling Back-Pat
to say hello again,

09:55.416 --> 09:58.117
or do you want me to say hello
back to Back-Pat?

09:58.119 --> 09:59.835
Don't [bleep] with me, Sajak.

09:59.837 --> 10:02.288
Just because I love you
and your smooth botoxed skin

10:02.290 --> 10:05.508
doesn't mean I won't snap
your goddamn spine!

10:05.510 --> 10:08.461
Be careful.
I think she's crazy.

10:09.514 --> 10:10.629
Hey!
What are you doing?

10:10.631 --> 10:13.299
- I'm watching the hockey game.
- Shut your ass up!

10:13.301 --> 10:16.102
<i>Man, white people.
You know what I'm saying?</i>

10:19.273 --> 10:21.474
- What's so goddamn funny?
- Quiet, boy.

10:21.476 --> 10:25.561
<i>Whi-i-i-i-i-ite people!</i>

10:28.149 --> 10:31.951
- I did not see that coming.
- I can't take this crap!

10:31.953 --> 10:34.820
- I'm sick of your bullshit!
- Stop it!

10:34.822 --> 10:36.956
Like it or not, we are a family now.

10:36.958 --> 10:40.459
You two need to spend the day
together like father and son.

10:40.461 --> 10:42.828
- But, Mommy...
- Oh, Anita, I don't want to.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.163
No arguments!

10:44.165 --> 10:45.548
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

10:45.550 --> 10:47.717
Oh, what's the matter, Malloy?

10:47.719 --> 10:50.169
Daddy and grandpa Denzel
were fighting.

10:50.171 --> 10:53.839
- I'm scared, gam-gam.
- Oh, you poor little bear.

10:53.841 --> 10:57.426
Here, I found this stack of
hundreds in Woody's underwear drawer.

10:57.428 --> 10:59.845
White people.
You know what I'm saying.

11:02.683 --> 11:04.517
One for me and one for Pat

11:04.519 --> 11:08.020
- and four for me and one for Pat.
- Connie, what are you doing?

11:08.022 --> 11:09.939
You're taking enough food
for ten people.

11:09.941 --> 11:12.858
Yeah. You usually only
take enough for nine.

11:12.860 --> 11:15.694
Um, there's a good re...
uh, a good explana...

11:18.032 --> 11:21.834
<i>Day two in the mysterious disappearance
of television icon Pat Sajak.</i>

11:21.836 --> 11:24.120
<i>Last seen at his hotel,
witnesses report seeing</i>

11:24.122 --> 11:27.706
<i>some sort of giant orange
sea cow in the vicinity.</i>

11:27.708 --> 11:30.709
Connie's hoarding food,
and Pat Sajak is missing?

11:30.711 --> 11:33.679
Steve, are you doing the math on this?

11:33.681 --> 11:36.382
Yes.

11:36.384 --> 11:37.883
Boobies!

11:40.688 --> 11:42.104
It is kind of nice out here.

11:42.106 --> 11:44.356
I'm only here because
Mommy's making me.

11:44.358 --> 11:46.559
You are on my everlasting shit list!

11:46.561 --> 11:50.529
Okay, look, I was a little hard
on you, but I'd say we're even now.

11:50.531 --> 11:53.399
- Plus, I really do like your mama.
- Whatever.

11:53.401 --> 11:56.285
Oh, damn it. I don't know
how to bait this hook.

11:56.287 --> 11:58.988
Here you go. Didn't your
dad ever take you fishing?

11:58.990 --> 12:01.240
Only once, and it took
that hooker all night

12:01.242 --> 12:04.210
to get her fists deep up my...
Oh, "fishing."

12:04.212 --> 12:06.520
No, he didn't.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.382
- Oh, I got one. I got one!
- Oh, get him! Reel him in!

12:10.384 --> 12:12.802
I got him.

12:12.804 --> 12:13.803
We got him.

12:13.805 --> 12:16.555
Good job, son.
This a nice fish.

12:16.557 --> 12:19.475
- He bit me.
- Man, [bleep] that fish.

12:19.477 --> 12:23.562
Whoo!

12:27.185 --> 12:29.268
Ouch! My leg!

12:34.942 --> 12:37.827
You goddamn...

12:42.617 --> 12:45.000
<i>Oh, my god.
I knew it.</i>

12:45.002 --> 12:47.753
<i>She killed Pat Sajak
and chopped him up.</i>

12:47.755 --> 12:50.122
I'm not seeing that.

12:53.845 --> 12:56.295
Oh, my god.
Ethel's dead!

12:56.297 --> 12:58.881
- Then who the hell are you?
- I'm Ethel.

12:58.883 --> 13:02.384
Then if you're Ethel,
I must be... Pat Sajak!

13:02.386 --> 13:04.854
So this is a mask!

13:04.856 --> 13:07.306
It's stuck on there pretty good.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.309
Okay, maybe this knife will help.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.977
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

13:11.979 --> 13:15.731
<i>Okay, it's working!
It's working!</i>

13:15.733 --> 13:19.818
I'm not Pat Sajak!
I'm a skeleton!

13:19.820 --> 13:24.990
White people, now I get it!

13:27.328 --> 13:28.460
Oh.

13:28.462 --> 13:29.828
Hey, uh,
everything cool, Woody?

13:29.830 --> 13:33.132
Yeah. It's just... well, they're
having a father-son picnic

13:33.134 --> 13:35.251
this weekend, and it makes me sad.

13:35.253 --> 13:37.136
That they have to advertise
these things in bars?

13:37.138 --> 13:40.005
No, because my dad
promised to take me to one once,

13:40.007 --> 13:41.173
but he never showed.

13:41.175 --> 13:44.977
- If only I'd dusted that [bleep] plant.
- Hey, you know what?

13:44.979 --> 13:46.679
I'll take you
to the father-son picnic.

13:46.681 --> 13:50.649
- You'd really do that for me?
- I still want to buy your slave.

13:50.651 --> 13:53.185
- Him.
- He's not a slave!

13:53.187 --> 13:55.938
- He's my father.
- Ooh!

13:59.360 --> 14:02.661
Uh-oh. It's 9:30.
Mommy told me to be home at 9:00.

14:02.663 --> 14:05.331
Don't worry about your mama.
This is father-and-son time.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.033
Now let's bash
this mother[bleep]'s skull in

14:08.035 --> 14:10.753
- together.
- Father-son time!

14:10.755 --> 14:13.289
- Father-son time!
- Yeah.

14:13.291 --> 14:15.507
Shh. My mom's a sheep.

14:15.509 --> 14:17.876
Did I say "sheep"?
I meant to say "asleep."

14:17.878 --> 14:20.379
Woodrow, you missed your curfew.

14:20.381 --> 14:24.016
- What am I going to do with you?
- Hmm. I got an idea.

14:29.174 --> 14:31.808
Oh, Pat,
have I got a surprise for you.

14:31.810 --> 14:33.710
Please don't tell me
there's a Front Pat.

14:35.547 --> 14:37.597
What do you think?

14:37.599 --> 14:40.216
Now you can live the game
with me forever.

14:40.218 --> 14:44.387
Wheel... of... fortune!

14:44.389 --> 14:47.223
Oh, my god! Connie
kidnapped an oompa loompa!

14:47.225 --> 14:50.360
- That's Pat Sajak, you idiot.
- Right.

14:50.362 --> 14:52.395
Oompa loompas aren't
that short and orange.

14:52.397 --> 14:55.815
- I'm calling the cops.
- If you do that, Pat Sajak will die.

14:55.817 --> 14:58.034
Your friend Connie has snapped.

14:58.036 --> 15:01.537
If you want to save his life,
you will do as I say.

15:01.539 --> 15:04.073
- Who are you?
- Name's Buzz Buzzer.

15:04.075 --> 15:06.876
I'm a professional game show
"host-age" negotiator.

15:06.878 --> 15:09.912
How often are popular
game show hosts held hostage?

15:09.914 --> 15:13.216
More than you think.
2012, Family feud.

15:13.218 --> 15:16.502
You think Richard Dawson
died of natural causes?

15:17.505 --> 15:22.258
2006, Press your luck.
You think Peter Tomarken retired?

15:23.928 --> 15:27.563
Dick Clark was kidnapped and killed
on seven separate occasions.

15:27.565 --> 15:29.482
We had to keep
tracking down look-alikes.

15:29.484 --> 15:32.935
By the time he had the stroke,
we were on our tenth dick.

15:32.937 --> 15:34.854
Sounds like Ethel on a slow weekend.

15:34.856 --> 15:36.773
Gam-gam bought me this,
by the way.

15:36.775 --> 15:38.318
See you later, assholes.

15:41.496 --> 15:43.196
Damn, Woody.

15:43.198 --> 15:44.747
That woman's never going to stop
treating you like a child

15:44.749 --> 15:46.082
unless you stand up for yourself.

15:46.084 --> 15:47.950
Be a man.
I raised you better than that.

15:47.952 --> 15:50.253
You know what, dad?
You're right.

15:50.255 --> 15:53.256
It is time for me
to stand up for myself.

15:54.342 --> 15:56.793
Those [bleep] birds
ate my hamstrings.

15:56.795 --> 16:00.463
Once you're in, just act like
contestants and play the game.

16:00.465 --> 16:02.932
When Connie wins,
the euphoria will distract her.

16:02.934 --> 16:05.518
Then you grab Sajak and get out.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.603
If the crimson beast loses,

16:07.605 --> 16:11.688
wah-woh!
Game over.

16:11.810 --> 16:14.310
Anita, your son has something
to say to you.

16:14.312 --> 16:15.862
What is it?

16:15.864 --> 16:18.314
Uh, you are the prettiest
Mommy in the whole world.

16:18.316 --> 16:20.450
- Bye.
- Woody, tell her.

16:20.452 --> 16:21.734
All right, all right.

16:21.736 --> 16:24.737
Uh, Mommy, when you let
africanized bees

16:24.739 --> 16:28.574
bloodthirsty crows attack me,
it's not nice, and I...

16:28.576 --> 16:33.129
- I don't want you to do that anymore.
- Oh, I had no idea.

16:33.131 --> 16:34.914
Would it make you
feel any better

16:34.916 --> 16:37.917
if I whipped you
with a rusty bicycle chain?!

16:37.919 --> 16:39.552
Oh, Jesus Christ!

16:39.554 --> 16:42.171
And you!
You put him up to this.

16:42.173 --> 16:44.807
You're a bad influence on my son.

16:44.809 --> 16:46.509
Don't you talk that way
to me, woman.

16:48.179 --> 16:51.693
Bitch, you think you're the only
one with a bicycle chain?

16:52.860 --> 16:55.685
- I'd like to buy an E.
- You don't really expect me

16:55.687 --> 16:57.520
to play along
with this insanity, do you?

16:57.522 --> 17:00.273
Yeah. Unless you want
me to cut off your face

17:00.275 --> 17:03.493
- and feed it to Back-Pat.
- Do we have any Es?

17:03.495 --> 17:05.778
Steve? Ethel?

17:05.780 --> 17:07.864
What are you doing
on Wheel of fortune?

17:07.866 --> 17:10.116
We're here to play the game, Connie.

17:10.117 --> 17:12.952
Yay!
Sorry, Gary. Sorry, Charlene.

17:12.954 --> 17:15.037
Your time is up.
Thanks for playing.

17:15.039 --> 17:17.707
Goddamn mother[bleep]!

17:17.709 --> 17:20.460
Help me, please! I'm too
rich and important to die.

17:20.462 --> 17:23.332
- I'm Pat [bleep] Sajak.
- Shhh.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.934
$5,000? Crap.

17:27.935 --> 17:30.970
Remember, Steve, you gotta lose.
Guess the letter Q.

17:30.972 --> 17:34.807
That's a terrible idea.
I bet this puzzle's full of Qs.

17:34.809 --> 17:38.644
- Is there an S?
- There are five Ses.

17:38.646 --> 17:40.396
Huh.
What are the odds of that?

17:41.783 --> 17:43.816
She's going to murder you all.

17:45.236 --> 17:46.736
<i>- Don't touch me with that!
- Ow!</i>

17:46.738 --> 17:49.372
<i>Stop it! Hey!</i>

17:49.374 --> 17:51.290
Woodrow, there's something
we have to tell you.

17:51.292 --> 17:54.076
Son, your mama and I
are getting a divorce.

17:54.078 --> 17:59.131
- Oh, no! It's my fault.
- Oh, Woody, it's not your fault.

17:59.133 --> 18:02.969
The divorce fairy came and
sprinkled some separation dust.

18:02.971 --> 18:04.921
Of course it's your fault!

18:04.923 --> 18:07.423
Oh, no! I did it again!

18:07.425 --> 18:09.892
Maybe I wasn't meant
to have a daddy.

18:09.894 --> 18:12.595
Aw, don't listen to her.
This ain't your fault.

18:12.597 --> 18:15.264
You're a good boy, Woody.
You just got a crazy-ass mama.

18:15.266 --> 18:19.068
Well, we can still go
to the father-son picnic, right?

18:19.070 --> 18:22.405
Not if we're not father and son.
Them's the rules.

18:22.407 --> 18:25.274
There's only one thing
that's going to end this pain.

18:30.415 --> 18:32.615
Steve, what are you doing?

18:32.617 --> 18:34.617
You're supposed to lose,
you dipshit.

18:34.619 --> 18:36.035
I'm trying to lose.

18:36.037 --> 18:37.753
Would you like to solve
the puzzle, Steve?

18:37.755 --> 18:39.088
Steve, don't even answer.

18:39.090 --> 18:42.758
- Get off my ballsack, Ethel.
- That's correct.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.594
The category was
"things that Fred Mertz

18:44.596 --> 18:46.429
<i>should have said on I Love Lucy."</i>

18:46.431 --> 18:50.182
- And Steve is the winner.
- Connie's not supposed to lose!

18:50.184 --> 18:52.802
Connie smash!

18:55.723 --> 19:00.309
Help! I'm being crushed
by a 350-pound monster.

19:00.311 --> 19:02.338
That's correct.
The category was

19:02.435 --> 19:04.897
"things Rebel Wilson's couch
might say."

19:05.983 --> 19:08.878
Oh, I can't believe I let myself fall

19:08.880 --> 19:12.115
under the voodoo spell
of that black man's dick.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.884
You know all the money I took
out of your underwear drawer?

19:14.886 --> 19:18.688
I think he stole some of that
out of my purse... typical.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.524
Don't you ever
talk that way about him.

19:21.526 --> 19:24.527
Uh-oh.
Does somebody need a spanking?

19:24.529 --> 19:26.913
Screw your spankings!
Denzel's right.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.748
I am done being
pushed around by you.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.951
I'm not the reason daddy left.
You are!

19:31.953 --> 19:33.786
What are you saying, Woody?

19:33.788 --> 19:35.671
Sorry, Mommy.
That was a little harsh.

19:35.673 --> 19:37.673
I guess what I really
meant to say is:

19:37.675 --> 19:41.094
- Get the [bleep] out!
- No, gam-gam, don't go.

19:41.096 --> 19:44.797
I ne... I need more presents.
I m... I mean I love you.

19:44.799 --> 19:46.466
I don't have
any more money, Malloy.

19:46.468 --> 19:49.018
Choke on my balls.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.140
You bastard.

19:54.142 --> 19:56.142
You made me love you
and your godlike knowledge

19:56.144 --> 19:58.694
of the alphabet,
and then you made me lose.

19:58.696 --> 20:00.229
Now you must die, Pat!

20:03.568 --> 20:05.618
I am not losing another one.

20:05.620 --> 20:08.704
I'll hold her off!
Save Sajak!

20:11.126 --> 20:14.293
Bah... bah... bur... brr...

20:14.295 --> 20:15.795
Give me back my Pat!

20:15.797 --> 20:19.665
Wait, why are we risking
our lives for Pat Sajak?

20:19.736 --> 20:21.770
Please don't hurt me.
I'll do anything.

20:21.772 --> 20:23.338
Anything?

20:23.340 --> 20:28.445
- And please welcome my lovely cohost.
- Hi, Pat.

20:33.016 --> 20:36.651
- Daddy, who's that man?
- Looks like a pedophile, son.

20:36.653 --> 20:40.956
- Hey, he's no pedophile. He's my son.
- Denzel, you came!

20:40.958 --> 20:45.060
Shh, now let's crush these
five-year-old skulls... together.
