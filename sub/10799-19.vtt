COMPUTER:

00:37.458 --> 00:39.458
Welcome to Risa.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.291
All that is ours is yours.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.709
We are looking for

00:42.333 --> 00:44.709
the lodging chamber

00:44.750 --> 00:47.125
of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

00:47.166 --> 00:49.792
A file scan reveals no record

00:49.834 --> 00:53.166
of a Captain Picard

00:49.834 --> 00:53.166
currently visiting Risa.

00:53.208 --> 00:56.458
When is he expected

00:53.208 --> 00:56.458
to arrive?

00:56.500 --> 00:59.208
There is no arrival date

00:56.500 --> 00:59.208
on file

00:59.250 --> 01:02.458
for any such individual.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.625
Could we have

01:02.500 --> 01:04.625
been mistaken?

01:07.750 --> 01:10.083
He will come.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.417
<i>Captain Picard</i>

01:21.667 --> 01:23.417
<i>has been serving as mediator</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:25.959
<i>in a trade dispute</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:25.959

01:26.000 --> 01:28.834
<i>and their nearest neighbor,</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:28.834
<i>the Dachlyds.</i>

01:30.500 --> 01:32.083
Welcome back, Deanna.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.208
It's good

01:32.125 --> 01:34.208
to be back.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.291
The last two weeks

01:34.250 --> 01:37.291
have been grueling.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.542
I take it the Captain was able

01:37.333 --> 01:39.542
to negotiate an agreement

01:39.583 --> 01:41.333
mutually beneficial

01:39.583 --> 01:41.333
to both parties.

01:41.375 --> 01:42.625
He was.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.208
I don't know how

01:42.667 --> 01:44.208
he managed it.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.917
The Gemarians

01:44.250 --> 01:45.917
and the Dachlyds

01:45.959 --> 01:48.166
are both incredibly

01:45.959 --> 01:48.166
stubborn people.

01:48.208 --> 01:52.250
The more difficult the task,

01:48.208 --> 01:52.250
the sweeter the victory.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.667
Go to warp four,

01:52.291 --> 01:54.667
Mr. Bennett.

01:54.709 --> 01:56.542
Set course

01:54.709 --> 01:56.542
for Starbase 12.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.792
Report.

01:57.834 --> 01:59.875
Everything's

01:57.834 --> 01:59.875
status quo, sir.

01:59.917 --> 02:02.750
Very well.

02:02.792 --> 02:04.625
If, um...

02:04.667 --> 02:08.166
anyone needs me,

02:04.667 --> 02:08.166
I'll be in my ready room.

02:08.208 --> 02:09.750
Sir?

02:11.792 --> 02:13.583
Congratulations.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.250
About what?

02:15.291 --> 02:16.875
About the trade agreement.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.083
(<i> grunts</i> )

02:21.792 --> 02:25.083
Is it my imagination or is

02:21.792 --> 02:25.083
something bothering the Captain?

02:25.125 --> 02:28.333
He has been under a great deal

02:25.125 --> 02:28.333
of strain lately.

02:28.375 --> 02:33.667
While we were on Gemaris, he ate

02:28.375 --> 02:33.667
sparingly and slept even less.

02:33.709 --> 02:34.875
Anything we can do?

02:34.917 --> 02:37.750
Actually, I have

02:34.917 --> 02:37.750
a solution in mind

02:37.792 --> 02:40.166
but I doubt he'll agree to it.

02:40.208 --> 02:42.417
What would that be?

02:42.458 --> 02:45.625
Our Captain needs a vacation.

03:14.709 --> 03:19.083
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

03:19.125 --> 03:23.458
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:19.125 --> 03:23.458

03:23.500 --> 03:25.417

03:25.458 --> 03:28.667

03:25.458 --> 03:28.667

04:46.959 --> 04:48.000
(<i> door chimes</i> )

04:48.041 --> 04:49.083
Come!

04:51.917 --> 04:54.333
Sir, it's been brought

04:51.917 --> 04:54.333
to my attention

04:54.375 --> 04:55.375
that one of the crew

04:55.417 --> 04:56.750
is neglecting

04:55.417 --> 04:56.750
his health again.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.125
How so?

04:58.166 --> 05:00.458
It's a classic case

04:58.166 --> 05:00.458
of stress-related ailments

05:00.500 --> 05:01.917
brought on by overwork--

05:01.959 --> 05:06.333
exhaustion, irritability,

05:01.959 --> 05:06.333
muscle spasms.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.333
Yet he insists

05:06.375 --> 05:09.333
on ignoring it.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.125
It doesn't sound

05:09.375 --> 05:11.125
too serious.

05:11.166 --> 05:13.834
And I plan on keeping it

05:11.166 --> 05:13.834
that way.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.625
What's the treatment?

05:17.667 --> 05:20.083
A week's shore leave.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.333
Oh... impossible.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.917
Jean-Luc, I could

05:22.375 --> 05:24.917
make that an order.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.500
But you won't.

05:26.542 --> 05:29.542
Oh, Beverly, you know

05:26.542 --> 05:29.542
I loathe vacations.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.667
You loathe<i> going</i> on vacations.

05:31.709 --> 05:34.667
Once you're there,

05:31.709 --> 05:34.667
you have a marvelous time.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.542
Why, you told me

05:34.709 --> 05:36.542
that your four days

05:36.583 --> 05:38.583
on Zytchin III

05:36.583 --> 05:38.583
were wonderful.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.792
I lied.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.250
Look...

05:42.291 --> 05:47.083
the<i> Enterprise</i>

05:42.291 --> 05:47.083
is scheduled to spend a week

05:47.125 --> 05:49.667
undergoing maintenance

05:47.125 --> 05:49.667
overhaul at Starbase 12.

05:49.709 --> 05:52.333
While there, I promise

05:49.709 --> 05:52.333
that I will make full use

05:52.375 --> 05:54.959
of available

05:52.375 --> 05:54.959
recreational activity.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.583
Watching some technician

05:55.041 --> 05:57.583
fill deuterium tanks

05:57.625 --> 05:59.333
is not my idea of fun.

05:59.375 --> 06:03.834
I suppose I could find a few

05:59.375 --> 06:03.834
hours to spend on the holodeck.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.291
Oh, forget the holodeck.

06:05.333 --> 06:08.417
Isn't there someplace special

06:05.333 --> 06:08.417
you want to go?

06:08.458 --> 06:12.417
The Astrophysics Center

06:08.458 --> 06:12.417
on Icor IX

06:12.458 --> 06:15.041
is holding a symposium

06:12.458 --> 06:15.041
on rogue star clusters.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.417
I had given serious thought

06:16.458 --> 06:17.792
to attending.

06:17.834 --> 06:21.542
The last thing you need

06:17.834 --> 06:21.542
is serious thought.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.625
Jean-Luc, why don't you go

06:21.583 --> 06:24.625
someplace beautiful

06:24.667 --> 06:27.458
where you can relax

06:24.667 --> 06:27.458
and be pampered?

06:27.500 --> 06:28.875
You deserve it.

06:28.917 --> 06:31.125
I'll give it serious thought.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.208
Captain...

06:32.250 --> 06:35.333
Doctor... enough.

06:46.417 --> 06:48.542
So, have you decided

06:46.417 --> 06:48.542
where you're going yet?

06:48.583 --> 06:50.250
Yes, I have, Number One.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.250
Bridge.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.875
No, I meant on

06:50.291 --> 06:52.875
your shore leave.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.875
Not you, too.

06:52.917 --> 06:55.667
Halt. I know this perfect

06:52.917 --> 06:55.667
little vacation spot.

06:55.709 --> 06:58.208
In fact, it falls within the

06:55.709 --> 06:58.208
coordinates of this sector.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.750
How convenient,

06:58.250 --> 06:59.750
except, Number One

06:59.792 --> 07:02.583
I have absolutely no intention

06:59.792 --> 07:02.583
of taking a holiday.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.375
Is that clear?

07:02.625 --> 07:04.375
Very clear.

07:04.417 --> 07:06.333
Good. I'm glad we got that

07:04.417 --> 07:06.333
straightened out. Resume.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.959
The place is

07:06.375 --> 07:07.959
called Risa

07:08.000 --> 07:09.917
and believe me, Captain,

07:08.000 --> 07:09.917
it is a paradise.

07:09.959 --> 07:12.250
Warm tropical

07:09.959 --> 07:12.250
breezes, exotic foods

07:12.291 --> 07:14.875
nothing to do but sit

07:12.291 --> 07:14.875
around all day, enjoy

07:12.291 --> 07:14.875
the quiet and then...

07:14.917 --> 07:16.041
the women.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.041
The women.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.041
Of course.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.542
I'm sure you would find

07:17.583 --> 07:19.625
their sybaritic outlook

07:17.583 --> 07:19.625
on life very appealing.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.166
Oh, I'm sure.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.000
I'm glad to hear

07:21.208 --> 07:23.000
you say so, sir.

07:23.041 --> 07:25.208
Unfortunately,

07:23.041 --> 07:25.208
this vessel is

07:23.041 --> 07:25.208
about to undergo

07:25.250 --> 07:28.834
extensive repairs

07:25.250 --> 07:28.834
requiring my personal

07:25.250 --> 07:28.834
supervision.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.000
What about Risa?

07:30.041 --> 07:32.500
Some other time, Number One.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.750
Will, I just had

07:32.542 --> 07:34.750
some terrific news.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.542
Really?

07:36.583 --> 07:39.750
There's an excellent

07:36.583 --> 07:39.750
chance that my mother

07:36.583 --> 07:39.750
may be joining us

07:39.792 --> 07:41.166
on Starbase 12.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.792
Your mother?

07:42.834 --> 07:46.000
She's returning home from

07:42.834 --> 07:46.000
a conference on Achrady VII

07:46.041 --> 07:48.250
and she's going to try

07:46.041 --> 07:48.250
to rearrange her schedule

07:48.291 --> 07:50.875
so she can spend some time

07:48.291 --> 07:50.875
visiting with us.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.375
That's wonderful, Deanna.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.375
She mentioned how much

07:52.417 --> 07:54.375
she was looking forward

07:54.417 --> 07:55.959
to seeing you again, Captain.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.166
Did she?

07:58.834 --> 08:00.458
Commander, could I have

07:58.834 --> 08:00.458
a word with you?

08:09.959 --> 08:12.542
Is something wrong, Captain?

08:12.583 --> 08:14.291
Tell me, Number One.

08:14.333 --> 08:17.792
Is the entire crew aware

08:14.333 --> 08:17.792
of this little scheme

08:17.834 --> 08:19.709
to send me off on holiday?

08:19.750 --> 08:22.625
I believe there are two ensigns

08:19.750 --> 08:22.625
stationed on deck 39

08:22.667 --> 08:24.333
who know nothing about it.

08:24.375 --> 08:28.125
I suppose this means

08:24.375 --> 08:28.125
I can look forward to a week

08:28.166 --> 08:31.000
of continual harassment

08:28.166 --> 08:31.000
on this subject?

08:32.375 --> 08:36.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

08:36.208 --> 08:42.250
I admit I have been feeling

08:36.208 --> 08:42.250
a little fatigued.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.041
I'll see to it

08:48.166 --> 08:50.041
that these bags

08:50.083 --> 08:52.125
are beamed directly

08:50.083 --> 08:52.125
to your room, sir.

08:52.166 --> 08:55.208
You look very handsome,

08:52.166 --> 08:55.208
if I might say so, Captain.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.583
Are you taking

08:55.250 --> 08:56.583
all these books?

08:56.625 --> 08:58.458
I thought I'd take

08:56.625 --> 08:58.458
some light reading

08:58.500 --> 09:00.083
in case I got bored.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.041
<i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.583
<i>Ethics, Sophistry and</i>

09:02.083 --> 09:04.583
<i>the Alternate Universe.</i>

09:04.625 --> 09:06.542
Ving Kuda-- you call

09:04.625 --> 09:06.542
that light reading?

09:06.583 --> 09:08.417
To each his own, Number One.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.750
Have I mentioned

09:08.458 --> 09:09.750
how imaginative

09:09.792 --> 09:11.375
the Risian women

09:09.792 --> 09:11.375
are, sir?

09:12.709 --> 09:15.709
Too often, Commander.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.125
I do have one request, sir.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.792
You want me to bring you back

09:26.166 --> 09:28.792
a souvenir?

09:28.834 --> 09:30.625
It's called a<i> Horga'hn.</i>

09:30.667 --> 09:32.583
I don't think you'll have

09:30.667 --> 09:32.583
any trouble finding one.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.792
Consider it done.

09:34.834 --> 09:37.875
Captain, I would feel better

09:34.834 --> 09:37.875
if you would allow me

09:37.917 --> 09:39.583
to assign a security

09:37.917 --> 09:39.583
officer to you.

09:39.625 --> 09:42.625
We will be out of communication

09:39.625 --> 09:42.625
range when we leave orbit.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.291
(<i> sighs</i> )

09:44.333 --> 09:46.542
I really don't think that will

09:44.333 --> 09:46.542
be necessary, Mr. Worf.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.959
Risa has a reputation

09:46.583 --> 09:49.959
of being a most peaceful planet.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.333
Aye, sir.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.375
Well, the ship is yours,

09:54.041 --> 09:57.375
Number One.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.750
Enjoy your

09:57.417 --> 09:59.750
trip, Captain.

09:59.792 --> 10:01.875
I'll try, Counselor.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.667
He's going to have

10:05.417 --> 10:07.667
a great time.

10:17.542 --> 10:19.500
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

10:19.542 --> 10:22.291
(<i> birds singing</i> )

10:40.291 --> 10:42.709
Oh... I beg your pardon.

10:47.250 --> 10:50.041
God, it's so good

10:47.250 --> 10:50.041
to see you again.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.792
I think you've mistaken me

10:55.500 --> 10:58.792
for someone else.

11:00.792 --> 11:04.625
You know, I think

11:00.792 --> 11:04.625
you might be right.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.417
Welcome to Risa.

11:06.458 --> 11:10.875
A simple handshake

11:06.458 --> 11:10.875
would have sufficed.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.709
(<i> woman laughing</i> )

11:46.750 --> 11:49.625
(<i> women squealing</i>

11:46.750 --> 11:49.625
<i>with laughter</i> )

11:49.667 --> 11:52.834
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

11:57.834 --> 11:59.834
(<i> sighs</i> )

12:01.917 --> 12:05.041
(<i> ball humming</i> )

12:11.125 --> 12:13.291
(<i> humming</i> )

12:13.333 --> 12:15.417
WOMAN:

12:13.333 --> 12:15.417
Return.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.250
My apologies.

12:17.291 --> 12:21.333
I fear I have yet to master

12:17.291 --> 12:21.333
the art of hoverball.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.417
So it would seem.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.917
My name is Joval.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.083
I'm employed here.

12:27.125 --> 12:28.709
Is there anything

12:27.125 --> 12:28.709
you require

12:28.750 --> 12:31.333
to make your stay

12:28.750 --> 12:31.333
a more pleasant one?

12:33.166 --> 12:34.792
You find me amusing.

12:34.834 --> 12:36.000
No.

12:36.041 --> 12:38.667
It's just that you are

12:36.041 --> 12:38.667
the fifth woman

12:38.709 --> 12:40.458
to ask me that question

12:38.709 --> 12:40.458
this morning.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.834
All I require is to sit

12:40.500 --> 12:43.834
in the sun, read my book...

12:43.875 --> 12:45.500
alone.

12:45.542 --> 12:48.333
And afterward?

12:48.375 --> 12:51.208
I really hadn't thought

12:48.375 --> 12:51.208
that far ahead.

12:51.250 --> 12:54.792
Then, may I suggest a swim,

12:51.250 --> 12:54.792
followed by a massage.

12:54.834 --> 12:58.583
Some other time, perhaps.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.375
I don't understand.

13:00.417 --> 13:02.458
You say you wish

13:00.417 --> 13:02.458
to be alone

13:02.500 --> 13:04.542
yet, you carry the<i> Horga'hn.</i>

13:04.583 --> 13:08.250
Well, I just purchased it.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.166
Why?

13:10.208 --> 13:13.834
Are you implying this has

13:10.208 --> 13:13.834
some special meaning?

13:13.875 --> 13:17.250
The<i> Horga'hn</i> is the Risian

13:13.875 --> 13:17.250
symbol of sexuality.

13:17.291 --> 13:20.542
To own one

13:17.291 --> 13:20.542
is to call forth its powers.

13:20.583 --> 13:24.500
To display it is to announce

13:20.583 --> 13:24.500
you are seeking<i> jamaharon.</i>

13:26.625 --> 13:28.500
Riker.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.500
Do you seek<i> jamaharon?</i>

13:30.542 --> 13:33.667
I don't even know what it means.

13:33.709 --> 13:36.125
The<i> Horga'hn</i> is for a friend.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.208
I see.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.208
Someone close to you.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.166
That's right.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.333
Someone you love.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.875
I wouldn't go that far.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.500
Well, your attitude

13:41.917 --> 13:44.500
is most puzzling.

13:44.542 --> 13:47.041
I will leave you

13:44.542 --> 13:47.041
now to your book.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.250
That is all I ask.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.458
You're blocking the suns.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.291
I know you're working with her.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.208
I warn you, it's a mistake.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.500
Are you addressing me?

14:22.542 --> 14:24.375
Don't bother to deny it.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.500
I've seen the two

14:24.417 --> 14:26.500
of you together.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.583
I don't know what the devil

14:26.542 --> 14:28.583
you're talking about.

14:28.625 --> 14:31.667
But, whatever it is, I assure

14:28.625 --> 14:31.667
you, it's no concern of mine.

14:31.709 --> 14:36.000
Tell her I want the disk

14:31.709 --> 14:36.000
returned to me immediately.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.375
Perhaps I have not

14:36.041 --> 14:39.375
made myself clear.

14:39.417 --> 14:41.250
You have the wrong man.

14:51.709 --> 14:55.250
I am rapidly losing patience

14:51.709 --> 14:55.250
with you.

14:55.291 --> 14:58.417
I demand you

14:55.291 --> 14:58.417
talk business.

14:58.458 --> 15:02.250
You'll find Ferengi demands

14:58.458 --> 15:02.250
carry little weight with me.

15:02.291 --> 15:06.667
Obviously, you've never dealt

15:02.291 --> 15:06.667
with my people before.

15:06.709 --> 15:07.917
(<i> chuckles</i> )

15:07.959 --> 15:10.875
On the contrary.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.875
All too often.

15:10.917 --> 15:14.250
Then, you know the Ferengi

15:10.917 --> 15:14.250
are not to be trifled with.

15:14.291 --> 15:15.583
Or trusted.

15:15.625 --> 15:19.625
You dare to insult me?!

15:26.208 --> 15:30.417
I advise you to listen closely,

15:26.208 --> 15:30.417
for I will not say this again.

15:30.458 --> 15:33.333
I came to Risa for a holiday,

15:30.458 --> 15:33.333
nothing more.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.208
I have no knowledge

15:33.375 --> 15:35.208
of this woman of whom you speak

15:35.250 --> 15:37.208
nor have I set eyes on any disk.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.542
(<i> laughs</i> )

15:39.583 --> 15:43.458
You expect me

15:39.583 --> 15:43.458
to believe such

15:39.583 --> 15:43.458
feeble lies?

15:43.500 --> 15:47.709
I don't care what you believe!

15:47.750 --> 15:50.917
This is not

15:47.750 --> 15:50.917
over yet, human.

15:50.959 --> 15:53.417
The disk is mine!

15:56.041 --> 15:58.542
And so is the woman.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.625
Remember that.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.458
WOMAN:

16:14.458 --> 16:16.458
Hello.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.959
Oh, it's you.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.875
Well, that's not much

16:20.000 --> 16:23.875
of a greeting.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.500
Look, I don't wish

16:23.917 --> 16:26.500
to appear rude

16:26.542 --> 16:29.625
but I am not seeking

16:26.542 --> 16:29.625
<i>jamaharon.</i>

16:31.625 --> 16:33.709
All right.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.500
But you really should try it

16:33.750 --> 16:36.500
sometime.

16:36.542 --> 16:37.959
If I try it

16:36.542 --> 16:37.959
it will be

16:38.000 --> 16:40.542
at a time

16:38.000 --> 16:40.542
of my own choosing.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.917
That's fine with me.

16:42.959 --> 16:46.333
It's not as though I was

16:42.959 --> 16:46.333
offering to help you find it.

16:49.291 --> 16:53.917
Uh... I, uh...

16:53.959 --> 16:55.667
I assumed that

16:55.709 --> 16:57.041
because of the way you

16:55.709 --> 16:57.041
welcomed me the other day...

16:57.083 --> 16:58.041
I'm sorry

16:58.083 --> 16:59.458
if I embarrassed you.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.500
I don't recall

16:59.500 --> 17:02.500
saying I was embarrassed.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.458
It's just that I prefer

17:02.542 --> 17:04.458
to be acquainted

17:04.500 --> 17:06.375
with the women that I kiss.

17:06.417 --> 17:07.625
That's understandable.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.125
The name's Vash.

17:09.166 --> 17:12.291
Jean-Luc Picard.

17:15.375 --> 17:18.166
So tell me about yourself,

17:15.375 --> 17:18.166
Jean-Luc.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.959
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

17:20.000 --> 17:22.583
Would you rather I guess?

17:22.625 --> 17:26.458
I can be

17:22.625 --> 17:26.458
very persistent.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.375
I'm the Captain

17:26.500 --> 17:29.375
of a Federation starship.

17:29.417 --> 17:32.250
Oh...

17:32.291 --> 17:34.875
That explains it.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.250
Explains what?

17:36.291 --> 17:39.750
I noticed you arguing

17:36.291 --> 17:39.750
with that Ferengi.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.208
For a moment there

17:41.250 --> 17:43.583
it looked like it was going

17:41.250 --> 17:43.583
to come to blows.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.417
You're the woman

17:43.625 --> 17:46.417
he was talking about.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.667
I hope your disagreement

17:46.458 --> 17:48.667
wasn't over me.

17:48.709 --> 17:52.667
For that information,

17:48.709 --> 17:52.667
you'll have to ask him.

17:52.709 --> 17:54.583
Where are you going?

17:54.625 --> 17:57.458
To find some privacy.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.458
Wait a second.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.166
What did he tell you?

17:57.500 --> 18:00.166
I bet there wasn't

17:57.500 --> 18:00.166
a bit of truth to it.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.083
And you said you

18:00.208 --> 18:02.083
didn't know her.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.834
I don't.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.834
And I don't want to.

18:04.875 --> 18:08.500
Return the disk to me

18:04.875 --> 18:08.500
and all will be forgiven.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.959
The disk doesn't belong

18:08.542 --> 18:10.959
to you, Sovak-- it never did.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.959
It would seem the two of you

18:11.000 --> 18:12.959
have a lot to discuss.

18:13.000 --> 18:13.959
If you will excuse me.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.667
Jean-Luc, I'm sorry.

18:15.709 --> 18:18.041
Perhaps I could explain

18:15.709 --> 18:18.041
all this to you later?

18:18.083 --> 18:21.500
Perhaps you can.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.333
I have a proposal

18:23.375 --> 18:25.000
I believe you'll find

18:23.375 --> 18:25.000
most interesting.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.667
Save your breath.

18:26.709 --> 18:29.667
I'm willing to pay you

18:26.709 --> 18:29.667
your weight in gold

18:29.709 --> 18:31.375
in exchange for the disk.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.959
Is that not a generous offer?

18:37.166 --> 18:42.208
Oh... I must have that woman.

18:50.834 --> 18:53.291
What the hell

18:50.834 --> 18:53.291
are you doing in my room?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.875
We are Vorgons.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.500
I am Ajur.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.375
This is Boratus.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.709
We come from

18:58.417 --> 19:00.709
the 27th century.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.250
We traveled 300

19:00.750 --> 19:03.250
years into the past

19:03.291 --> 19:05.000
to find you.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.709
All right, let's assume for the

19:09.458 --> 19:11.709
moment that I believe you.

19:11.750 --> 19:15.417
That you are, indeed,

19:11.750 --> 19:15.417
from the future.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.250
What is it

19:15.458 --> 19:18.250
you want from me?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.709
Have you heard of the<i> Tox Uthat?</i>

19:20.750 --> 19:23.208
What?

19:23.250 --> 19:25.792
I'm aware of the legend.

19:25.834 --> 19:31.625
It tells of a visitor...

19:25.834 --> 19:31.625
from the future

19:31.667 --> 19:36.458
who left behind a mysterious

19:31.667 --> 19:36.458
device known as the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

19:36.500 --> 19:39.083
Essentially that story

19:36.500 --> 19:39.083
is correct.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.333
Then the<i> Uthat</i> actually exists?

19:43.375 --> 19:47.625
Yes. It was invented by

19:43.375 --> 19:47.625
a scientist named Kal Dano

19:47.667 --> 19:49.458
in the mid-27th century.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.333
The<i> Uthat</i> is a quantum

19:49.500 --> 19:52.333
phase inhibitor

19:52.375 --> 19:56.083
capable of halting all

19:52.375 --> 19:56.083
nuclear reaction within a star.

20:00.333 --> 20:07.125
But... why bring such

20:00.333 --> 20:07.125
a powerful weapon into the past?

20:07.166 --> 20:09.250
Criminals attempted

20:07.166 --> 20:09.250
to steal the device

20:09.291 --> 20:12.208
so he fled back

20:09.291 --> 20:12.208
to the 22nd century,

20:09.291 --> 20:12.208
where he hid it.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.041
Ajur and I were

20:12.250 --> 20:14.041
the security team

20:14.083 --> 20:16.000
assigned to

20:14.083 --> 20:16.000
retrieve the<i> Uthat.</i>

20:16.041 --> 20:17.834
I gather you were unsuccessful.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.834
Yes.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.834
When we returned

20:19.875 --> 20:22.208
we began to search

20:19.875 --> 20:22.208
through the historical records

20:22.250 --> 20:24.875
for some clue

20:22.250 --> 20:24.875
to the<i> Uthat's</i> fate.

20:24.917 --> 20:26.709
And your search led you to me?

20:26.750 --> 20:29.625
We came upon a brief account

20:26.750 --> 20:29.625
stating that you had discovered

20:29.667 --> 20:33.041
an object of unknown origin

20:29.667 --> 20:33.041
while vacationing in Risa.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.750
From its description--

20:34.792 --> 20:36.959
a crystal fitting

20:34.792 --> 20:36.959
into the palm of the hand--

20:37.000 --> 20:40.875
we surmised it could

20:37.000 --> 20:40.875
very well be the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

20:40.917 --> 20:44.417
Well, I'm sorry

20:40.917 --> 20:44.417
to disappoint you

20:44.458 --> 20:48.125
but I haven't found anything,

20:44.458 --> 20:48.125
including peace

20:48.166 --> 20:50.333
which is the only thing

20:48.166 --> 20:50.333
I'm looking for.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.125
You<i> will</i> find

20:50.375 --> 20:53.125
such a device, Captain.

20:53.166 --> 20:56.041
To us, it is already

20:53.166 --> 20:56.041
part of history.

20:56.083 --> 21:00.709
And, uh, if I find it,

20:56.083 --> 21:00.709
what then?

21:00.750 --> 21:02.750
You will give it to us

21:00.750 --> 21:02.750
immediately

21:02.792 --> 21:04.500
so that we may return with it.

21:04.542 --> 21:10.583
Well, the<i> Uthat</i> belongs

21:04.542 --> 21:10.583
to your time, not mine.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.375
(<i> buzzing whir</i> )

21:38.417 --> 21:39.959
May I come in?

21:41.750 --> 21:43.750
Excuse the mess.

21:43.792 --> 21:47.375
Sovak has taken to searching

21:43.792 --> 21:47.375
my room periodically.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.625
This what he's

21:48.333 --> 21:50.625
looking for?

21:50.667 --> 21:52.959
I'm sorry I had

21:50.667 --> 21:52.959
to hide it like that.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.208
I was afraid he'd start

21:53.000 --> 21:56.208
searching me next.

21:56.250 --> 22:01.041
This disk must contain some

21:56.250 --> 22:01.041
very valuable information.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.125
Well, I doubt it's anything

22:01.083 --> 22:03.125
you'd be interested in.

22:03.166 --> 22:04.583
Depends.

22:04.625 --> 22:05.834
On what?

22:05.875 --> 22:07.208
On whether or not

22:07.250 --> 22:10.709
it has something to do

22:07.250 --> 22:10.709
with the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

22:15.542 --> 22:17.208
Did Sovak tell you that?

22:17.250 --> 22:18.709
Well, let's

22:17.250 --> 22:18.709
just say

22:18.750 --> 22:22.083
I've heard... rumors

22:22.125 --> 22:27.041
that the<i> Uthat</i> is located

22:22.125 --> 22:27.041
somewhere on Risa.

22:27.083 --> 22:30.750
Look, the last thing I need

22:27.083 --> 22:30.750
is a partner.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.500
So it's true.

22:33.542 --> 22:35.583
Have a seat.

22:37.875 --> 22:41.583
I don't suppose you ever heard

22:37.875 --> 22:41.583
of Professor Samuel Estragon?

22:41.625 --> 22:43.500
Yes, as a matter

22:41.625 --> 22:43.500
of fact, I have.

22:43.542 --> 22:46.250
He spent half his life searching

22:43.542 --> 22:46.250
for the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

22:46.291 --> 22:48.000
I served

22:46.291 --> 22:48.000
as his personal assistant

22:48.041 --> 22:49.709
for the past five years.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.417
Shortly before he died,

22:49.750 --> 22:52.417
he uncovered new data

22:52.458 --> 22:54.041
pinpointing its location

22:54.083 --> 22:58.583
and that disk contains

22:54.083 --> 22:58.583
his research notes and maps.

22:58.625 --> 23:02.000
And you're continuing his work.

23:02.041 --> 23:03.208
Exactly.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.834
With a Ferengi as an associate?

23:04.875 --> 23:09.208
Sovak and I definitely are not

23:04.875 --> 23:09.208
working together.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.458
But the two

23:09.250 --> 23:10.458
of you

23:10.500 --> 23:13.417
are... very well acquainted.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.500
Well, at times

23:15.542 --> 23:18.959
he aided the professor

23:15.542 --> 23:18.959
in his explorations.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.667
Especially in situations

23:19.000 --> 23:22.667
that weren't quite ethical.

23:24.417 --> 23:26.166
And now with typical

23:24.417 --> 23:26.166
Ferengi logic

23:26.208 --> 23:28.875
he's convinced that

23:26.208 --> 23:28.875
the<i> Tox Uthat</i> belongs to him.

23:28.917 --> 23:31.583
All he cares about is selling it

23:28.917 --> 23:31.583
to the highest bidder.

23:31.625 --> 23:35.417
Whereas you, of course,

23:31.625 --> 23:35.417
have a nobler purpose in mind.

23:35.458 --> 23:37.250
I told the professor

23:35.458 --> 23:37.250
I'd present it

23:37.291 --> 23:39.125
to the Daystrom

23:37.291 --> 23:39.125
Institute for study.

23:39.166 --> 23:40.250
Ah.

23:40.291 --> 23:42.125
But, first, I have

23:40.291 --> 23:42.125
to find it

23:42.166 --> 23:45.709
and that won't be easy with

23:42.166 --> 23:45.709
Sovak watching me every minute.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.125
I'll go in your place.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.250
And what about me?

23:56.291 --> 23:57.458
You remain here.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.542
It's safer.

23:58.583 --> 23:59.875
Is that an order?

23:59.917 --> 24:01.375
Absolutely.

24:01.417 --> 24:04.583
This isn't a starship, Jean-Luc.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.000
I don't follow orders.

24:06.041 --> 24:08.542
Oh, I see.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.542
Besides, you'd never

24:08.583 --> 24:10.542
find it without me.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.917
The professor's notes

24:10.583 --> 24:13.917
are in code.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.667
From the moment I met you

24:18.709 --> 24:20.458
I knew you were going

24:18.709 --> 24:20.458
to be trouble.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.834
You look like a man

24:20.500 --> 24:23.834
who could handle trouble.

24:23.875 --> 24:27.667
So, where exactly

24:23.875 --> 24:27.667
is the location?

24:27.709 --> 24:30.333
It's about 27 kilometers

24:27.709 --> 24:30.333
due east.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.125
There's some subterranean

24:30.375 --> 24:32.125
caves there.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.667
That's where you'll

24:32.166 --> 24:34.667
find the<i> Uthat.</i>

24:34.709 --> 24:37.375
I'll meet you in the lobby

24:34.709 --> 24:37.375
in 15 minutes.

24:37.417 --> 24:38.875
Be punctual.

24:38.917 --> 24:43.792
Oh, and, uh, I advise you

24:38.917 --> 24:43.792
to change your clothing.

24:43.834 --> 24:46.417
Jean-Luc?

24:46.458 --> 24:49.959
We're going to make

24:46.458 --> 24:49.959
a wonderful team.

24:53.417 --> 24:55.458
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

24:55.500 --> 24:57.667
(<i> birds singing</i> )

25:05.166 --> 25:07.375
I expected such treachery.

25:07.417 --> 25:09.375
Did you think

25:07.417 --> 25:09.375
you could sneak

25:07.417 --> 25:09.375
away from me

25:09.417 --> 25:11.291
so easily?

25:18.125 --> 25:20.333
The disk-- where is it?

25:20.375 --> 25:22.500
Didn't anyone tell you weapons

25:20.375 --> 25:22.500
aren't allowed on Risa?

25:22.542 --> 25:24.709
You're making a grave mistake

25:24.750 --> 25:26.375
putting your trust

25:24.750 --> 25:26.375
in this woman.

25:26.417 --> 25:28.000
It would be a worse mistake

25:26.417 --> 25:28.000
to trust you.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.625
Silence!

25:29.667 --> 25:33.792
Do you know how she acquired

25:29.667 --> 25:33.792
the disk in the first place?

25:33.834 --> 25:34.709
Sovak!

25:34.750 --> 25:38.375
(<i> laughing</i> )

25:38.417 --> 25:41.125
I paid her to steal it.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.208
But instead,

25:41.166 --> 25:43.208
she betrayed me

25:43.250 --> 25:46.583
and used my money

25:43.250 --> 25:46.583
to make her way here.

25:46.625 --> 25:47.959
It didn't happen that way.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.375
She's a greedy

25:48.000 --> 25:53.375
and unscrupulous woman.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.750
(<i> sighing</i> )

25:55.792 --> 25:58.709
A perfect mate for a Ferengi.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.750
You're becoming quite annoying,

25:58.750 --> 26:00.750
Sovak.

26:00.792 --> 26:03.333
As are you, human.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.333
Perhaps I should kill you

26:05.375 --> 26:06.875
and then take the disk.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.083
No, wait.

26:08.125 --> 26:10.125
You can have it.

26:25.875 --> 26:29.291
See, I told you we'd

26:25.875 --> 26:29.291
make a wonderful team.

26:33.750 --> 26:36.291
We've got a long trip.

26:41.917 --> 26:45.083
(<i> device beeping</i> )

26:49.542 --> 26:54.333
Have you calculated

26:49.542 --> 26:54.333
how much further we have to go?

26:54.375 --> 26:56.667
Another 11 kilometers.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.625
We should stay here

26:59.625 --> 27:01.625
for the night.

27:01.667 --> 27:02.625
I was hoping

27:02.667 --> 27:04.041
you'd say that.

27:05.792 --> 27:09.000
Actually, we've...

27:09.041 --> 27:12.000
we've made better time

27:09.041 --> 27:12.000
than I expected.

27:12.041 --> 27:14.208
Well, I'll take that

27:12.041 --> 27:14.208
as a compliment.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.458
As it was intended.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.667
(<i> sighs</i> )

27:32.208 --> 27:35.208
Jean-Luc...

27:35.250 --> 27:37.875
I'm afraid I haven't been

27:35.250 --> 27:37.875
completely honest with you.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.750
Forgive me

27:37.917 --> 27:40.750
if I don't act surprised.

27:43.625 --> 27:47.458
Sovak did pay me

27:43.625 --> 27:47.458
to hand over the disk.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.834
So you did steal it.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.875
It wasn't stealing.

27:51.917 --> 27:53.250
The professor had died.

27:53.291 --> 27:55.250
I had already spent

27:53.291 --> 27:55.250
five years of my life

27:55.291 --> 27:57.166
tracking down the<i> Uthat.</i>

27:57.208 --> 27:58.792
But you took Sovak's money.

27:58.834 --> 28:02.875
It was the only way

27:58.834 --> 28:02.875
I could afford to get to Risa.

28:02.917 --> 28:06.792
As for Sovak, he got

28:02.917 --> 28:06.792
exactly what he deserved.

28:06.834 --> 28:12.792
Well, any woman who can

28:06.834 --> 28:12.792
beat a Ferengi at his own game

28:12.834 --> 28:14.667
bears watching.

28:14.709 --> 28:19.375
I'll take that

28:14.709 --> 28:19.375
as another compliment.

28:19.417 --> 28:22.166
I'm flattered.

28:22.208 --> 28:25.166
Hmm. Well...

28:25.208 --> 28:27.792
we should get some sleep.

28:35.792 --> 28:38.542
You know, Jean-Luc, it's

28:35.792 --> 28:38.542
lucky for you we met.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.667
If it wasn't for me...

28:40.709 --> 28:42.333
If it wasn't for me

28:42.375 --> 28:46.667
you'd still be back there

28:42.375 --> 28:46.667
sitting in the sun, relaxing.

28:46.709 --> 28:49.625
That happens to be

28:46.709 --> 28:49.625
why I came to Risa.

28:49.667 --> 28:52.458
I'm sure you hated

28:49.667 --> 28:52.458
every minute of it.

28:52.500 --> 28:55.208
That kind of vacation

28:52.500 --> 28:55.208
isn't for a man like you.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.208
You need excitement.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.458
Excitement?

28:57.500 --> 29:00.500
Spending the night

28:57.500 --> 29:00.500
in a damp cave

29:00.542 --> 29:03.834
chasing after something we

29:00.542 --> 29:03.834
shall probably never find?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.834
You're enjoying yourself,

29:05.000 --> 29:06.834
aren't you?

29:06.875 --> 29:08.250
Ah.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.125
Yes.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.875
I just wanted

29:13.166 --> 29:14.875
to hear you say it.

29:14.917 --> 29:17.875
Good, now let's

29:14.917 --> 29:17.875
get some sleep.

29:40.875 --> 29:43.750
(<i> chuckles</i> )

29:43.792 --> 29:46.041
I'll never forget that look

29:43.792 --> 29:46.041
on your face

29:46.083 --> 29:48.542
when you thought I was

29:46.083 --> 29:48.542
offering you<i> jamaharon.</i>

29:48.583 --> 29:52.083
Now, that was a simple

29:48.583 --> 29:52.083
misunderstanding.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.125
Oh.

29:57.917 --> 29:59.667
(<i> sighs</i> )

29:59.709 --> 30:02.083
You did seem

29:59.709 --> 30:02.083
a little disappointed

30:02.125 --> 30:03.583
when I turned you down.

30:03.625 --> 30:06.166
(<i> chuckling</i> )

30:06.208 --> 30:09.959
You are outrageous.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.500
Thank you.

30:13.959 --> 30:18.875
You're pretty stimulating

30:13.959 --> 30:18.875
yourself.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.083
Don't you see?

30:20.125 --> 30:22.041
We're a lot alike.

30:22.083 --> 30:24.500
That's probably why

30:22.083 --> 30:24.500
we get along so well.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.792
You call this

30:24.542 --> 30:26.792
getting along?

30:26.834 --> 30:29.583
Fine.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.417
We don't get along.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.417
We're not getting along.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.041
I didn't say that.

30:33.083 --> 30:37.166
No, no. If you want to believe

30:33.083 --> 30:37.166
that we're not getting along

30:37.208 --> 30:39.083
that's all

30:37.208 --> 30:39.083
right with me...

30:52.667 --> 30:55.500
You still think

30:52.667 --> 30:55.500
I'm trouble?

30:59.709 --> 31:02.041
I'm sure of it.

31:12.792 --> 31:16.208
(<i> device beeping</i> )

31:24.750 --> 31:26.250
VASH:

31:24.750 --> 31:26.250
This is it.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.417
We've reached the end

31:26.291 --> 31:28.417
of our journey.

31:28.458 --> 31:30.125
(<i> beeping</i> )

31:30.166 --> 31:33.208
Do you have the

31:30.166 --> 31:33.208
exact location?

31:33.250 --> 31:37.500
Seven meters from the opening,

31:33.250 --> 31:37.500
along the wall.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.375
That should make it

31:42.500 --> 31:44.375
about here.

31:44.417 --> 31:47.583
(<i> beeping louder</i> )

31:48.792 --> 31:50.583
What the...?!

31:52.500 --> 31:54.500
Is something wrong?

31:55.959 --> 31:57.083
(<i> sighs</i> )

31:57.125 --> 31:59.667
I can't get a reading on this.

31:59.709 --> 32:03.000
There must be Starithium ore

31:59.709 --> 32:03.000
in these rocks.

32:03.041 --> 32:06.625
And that leaves us

32:03.041 --> 32:06.625
but one alternative.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.166
Shall we?

32:26.667 --> 32:28.375
Picard!

32:30.375 --> 32:32.542
A little premature,

32:30.375 --> 32:32.542
aren't we?

32:32.583 --> 32:36.417
We are to be a witness

32:32.583 --> 32:36.417
to a great moment, Picard.

32:36.458 --> 32:39.667
Who the hell are they?

32:39.709 --> 32:41.959
They are...

32:42.000 --> 32:45.875
security officers

32:42.000 --> 32:45.875
from the 27th century.

32:45.917 --> 32:48.208
They're here to take back the

32:45.917 --> 32:48.208
<i>Uthat.</i>

32:48.250 --> 32:52.625
You knew about this

32:48.250 --> 32:52.625
and didn't say anything?

32:52.667 --> 32:54.917
I'm sorry, Vash.

32:54.959 --> 32:57.375
Would you have brought me here

32:54.959 --> 32:57.375
if I had told you?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.750
Probably not.

33:00.792 --> 33:02.458
My point exactly.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.542
SOVAK:

33:02.500 --> 33:04.542
So, the betrayer

33:04.583 --> 33:06.208
is herself betrayed.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.208
Well, you've put together

33:06.250 --> 33:09.208
quite a little team.

33:09.250 --> 33:10.834
Do not interrupt the Captain.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.792
SOVAK:

33:10.875 --> 33:12.792
Quiet!

33:12.834 --> 33:14.583
PICARD:

33:12.834 --> 33:14.583
How did you get here?

33:14.625 --> 33:17.041
SOVAK:

33:14.625 --> 33:17.041
I found the disk in her room.

33:17.083 --> 33:19.375
That's impossible.

33:19.417 --> 33:21.291
I made a copy

33:19.417 --> 33:21.291
as a precaution

33:21.333 --> 33:22.709
but I burned it

33:21.333 --> 33:22.709
before we left.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.709
Ah... only the outer casing

33:22.750 --> 33:25.709
was incinerated.

33:25.750 --> 33:28.625
Now, I had no intention

33:25.750 --> 33:28.625
of interrupting you.

33:28.667 --> 33:32.250
Please,<i> continue digging!</i>

33:42.542 --> 33:46.250
(<i> laughing</i> )

33:56.333 --> 33:57.875
(<i> grunting</i> )

34:02.917 --> 34:05.458
No one told you

34:02.917 --> 34:05.458
to stop digging, human.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.625
I see no reason

34:05.500 --> 34:07.625
to continue.

34:07.667 --> 34:09.291
You will do as I say.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.375
Look about you, Sovak.

34:14.417 --> 34:17.375
By now it must be

34:14.417 --> 34:17.375
obvious, even to you.

34:17.417 --> 34:19.208
The<i> Uthat</i> is not here.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.625
(<i> Sovak cackling</i> )

34:20.667 --> 34:21.792
Is this

34:21.834 --> 34:24.583
some pathetic attempt

34:21.834 --> 34:24.583
at trickery?

34:24.625 --> 34:26.000
Of course, it's here.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.458
We simply haven't

34:26.041 --> 34:28.458
found it yet.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.250
Are you saying that the

34:28.500 --> 34:32.250
professor's findings were wrong?

34:32.291 --> 34:34.291
It would appear so.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.458
But how can that be?

34:35.500 --> 34:37.583
His evidence

34:35.500 --> 34:37.583
was overwhelming.

34:37.625 --> 34:39.083
Enough with this foolishness!

34:39.125 --> 34:42.000
Can't you see

34:39.125 --> 34:42.000
he's trying to deceive us?

34:42.041 --> 34:44.458
Return to work this instant.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.583
I'm afraid he's right, Sovak.

34:48.625 --> 34:51.750
According to the disk, we should

34:48.625 --> 34:51.750
have reached it hours ago.

34:51.792 --> 34:53.041
Lies!

34:53.083 --> 34:55.083
Treachery!

34:55.125 --> 34:56.959
This cannot be happening.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.583
Not another failure.

34:58.625 --> 35:01.041
Not after having come so close.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.041
It is most puzzling.

35:08.458 --> 35:10.166
(<i> buzzing whir</i> )

35:14.291 --> 35:17.125
It's over, Sovak.

35:17.166 --> 35:20.875
No, I will not be cheated

35:17.166 --> 35:20.875
out of my prize.

35:20.917 --> 35:22.291
Tell him!

35:22.333 --> 35:25.709
Tell him the professor's

35:22.333 --> 35:25.709
research is irrefutable.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.333
I don't know anymore.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.792
Then step aside.

35:37.709 --> 35:41.041
The<i> Uthat</i> is here, somewhere.

35:41.083 --> 35:44.208
It's just waiting to be found.

35:44.250 --> 35:47.625
It can't hide

35:44.250 --> 35:47.625
from me forever.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.458
(<i> panting</i> )

36:00.792 --> 36:05.083
Five years of my life wasted.

36:11.792 --> 36:13.750
There will be

36:11.792 --> 36:13.750
other treasures

36:13.792 --> 36:16.041
to be found, Vash.

36:16.083 --> 36:18.709
Not like the<i> Uthat.</i>

36:26.500 --> 36:31.000
I hope you won't mind,

36:26.500 --> 36:31.000
but, um...

36:31.041 --> 36:33.875
I need to be alone.

36:57.417 --> 36:59.667
(<i> birds calling</i> )

37:04.333 --> 37:07.625
RIKER:

37:04.333 --> 37:07.625
<i>Enterprise</i> to Captain Picard.

37:07.667 --> 37:09.291
Picard here.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.125
Go ahead, Commander.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.667
We hope we're not interrupting

37:11.166 --> 37:13.667
anything important, Captain

37:13.709 --> 37:15.041
but we wanted to inform you

37:15.083 --> 37:17.208
that we have achieved orbit

37:15.083 --> 37:17.208
around Risa

37:17.250 --> 37:19.959
and we're ready to beam you

37:17.250 --> 37:19.959
aboard at your convenience.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.041
I'll be returning shortly,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.041
Commander.

37:22.083 --> 37:24.208
In the interim, stand ready

37:24.250 --> 37:28.208
to initiate Transporter Code 14

37:24.250 --> 37:28.208
at my signal.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.500
Transporter Code 14?

37:30.542 --> 37:32.166
You heard me, Number One.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.291
Yes, sir.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.542
Picard out.

37:50.792 --> 37:53.458
PICARD:

37:50.792 --> 37:53.458
Leaving so soon?

37:53.500 --> 37:56.250
Jean-Luc.

37:56.291 --> 38:00.291
I was just about

37:56.291 --> 38:00.291
to come say good-bye.

38:03.709 --> 38:07.750
Well, then... I've

38:03.709 --> 38:07.750
saved you the bother.

38:09.667 --> 38:13.667
I want to put this all behind me

38:09.667 --> 38:13.667
as soon as possible.

38:13.709 --> 38:15.542
You understand?

38:15.583 --> 38:18.750
Of course.

38:18.792 --> 38:21.625
There's just one last

38:18.792 --> 38:21.625
thing you can do for me.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.583
Anything.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.333
Tell me where you've

38:25.000 --> 38:29.333
hidden the<i> Tox Uthat.</i>

38:29.375 --> 38:31.000
That's not funny.

38:31.041 --> 38:34.291
You never intended to

38:31.041 --> 38:34.291
burn that second disk.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.458
If you had, you wouldn't

38:34.333 --> 38:36.458
have been so careless

38:36.500 --> 38:38.709
as to allow Sovak

38:36.500 --> 38:38.709
to salvage any of it.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.875
You wanted him

38:38.750 --> 38:40.875
to follow us

38:40.917 --> 38:43.166
so that he could

38:40.917 --> 38:43.166
see for himself

38:43.208 --> 38:47.250
that the<i> Uthat</i> wasn't

38:43.208 --> 38:47.250
at the cave site.

38:47.291 --> 38:49.834
That was the only way

38:47.291 --> 38:49.834
he could be convinced

38:49.875 --> 38:52.208
that your quest

38:49.875 --> 38:52.208
had been futile.

38:52.250 --> 38:55.417
But how could I have known

38:52.250 --> 38:55.417
the<i> Uthat</i> wasn't there?

38:55.458 --> 38:58.125
Because you had already

38:55.458 --> 38:58.125
been there once before.

38:58.166 --> 39:01.750
Probably the moment you

38:58.166 --> 39:01.750
arrived on the planet.

39:01.792 --> 39:04.250
That's when you found it.

39:10.417 --> 39:14.542
You're a man

39:10.417 --> 39:14.542
of many talents, Jean-Luc.

39:30.834 --> 39:34.250
A piece of the future.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.041
A very dangerous piece.

39:50.959 --> 39:53.000
Were you really

39:50.959 --> 39:53.000
going to give this

39:53.041 --> 39:55.583
to the Daystrom Institute?

39:55.625 --> 40:01.583
Well, maybe not<i> give</i> it.

40:01.625 --> 40:05.583
Five years is

40:01.625 --> 40:05.583
a huge investment, Jean-Luc.

40:05.625 --> 40:08.667
I deserve to make

40:05.625 --> 40:08.667
a reasonable profit.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.583
Congratulations,

40:10.375 --> 40:12.583
Picard.

40:12.625 --> 40:16.250
We knew you

40:12.625 --> 40:16.250
would not fail us.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.625
You're not going to just

40:16.291 --> 40:18.625
hand it over, are you?

40:18.667 --> 40:20.041
You didn't trust me.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.625
What makes you think

40:20.083 --> 40:22.625
you can trust them?

40:22.667 --> 40:26.250
I assume the Vorgons have proof

40:22.667 --> 40:26.250
to back up their claim.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.375
Our being here

40:26.291 --> 40:28.375
is proof enough.

40:29.291 --> 40:31.542
Wait a second, Vorgons?

40:31.583 --> 40:34.583
The professor's notes said

40:31.583 --> 40:34.583
that it was two Vorgons

40:34.625 --> 40:35.959
a male and a female,

40:34.625 --> 40:35.959
who attempted

40:36.000 --> 40:38.208
to steal the<i> Uthat</i>

40:36.000 --> 40:38.208
in the first place.

40:38.250 --> 40:41.083
For all we know,

40:38.250 --> 40:41.083
it could be them.

40:43.500 --> 40:46.750
You, uh... You're going

40:43.500 --> 40:46.750
to have to prove

40:46.792 --> 40:48.250
that you are

40:46.792 --> 40:48.250
who you say you are.

40:48.291 --> 40:49.542
You yourself said

40:49.583 --> 40:51.583
the<i> Uthat</i> belongs

40:49.583 --> 40:51.583
to the future.

40:51.625 --> 40:53.500
But not necessarily to you.

40:53.542 --> 40:56.417
You will return

40:53.542 --> 40:56.417
what is ours.

40:56.458 --> 40:57.500
No!

41:00.333 --> 41:02.083
<i>Enterprise,</i> Code 14.

41:02.125 --> 41:04.291
Lock onto present coordinates,

41:02.125 --> 41:04.291
two-second delay.

41:04.333 --> 41:05.583
Mark!

41:11.333 --> 41:13.166
Are you all right?

41:16.417 --> 41:18.166
Go.

41:18.208 --> 41:20.417
Return

41:18.208 --> 41:20.417
to your own time.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.291
There's nothing for you here.

41:22.333 --> 41:25.875
History recorded

41:22.333 --> 41:25.875
that<i> you</i> destroyed the<i> Uthat.</i>

41:25.917 --> 41:31.250
You have fulfilled

41:25.917 --> 41:31.250
your destiny all

41:25.917 --> 41:31.250
too well, Picard.

41:32.125 --> 41:33.792
(<i> buzzing whir</i> )

41:53.750 --> 41:55.291
I don't suppose

41:53.750 --> 41:55.291
there are any openings

41:55.333 --> 41:58.709
for an archaeologist

41:55.333 --> 41:58.709
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

42:04.166 --> 42:07.083
Somehow I doubt you'd find

42:04.166 --> 42:07.083
life aboard a starship

42:07.125 --> 42:09.291
suitable to your taste.

42:11.917 --> 42:14.750
Probably not.

42:14.792 --> 42:17.291
I could never tolerate

42:14.792 --> 42:17.291
all that discipline.

42:17.333 --> 42:18.834
Oh...

42:24.166 --> 42:26.291
So...

42:29.917 --> 42:32.667
What are your plans?

42:32.709 --> 42:36.125
I thought I might explore

42:32.709 --> 42:36.125
the ruins on Sarthong V.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.083
Oh! Unbelievable!

42:39.542 --> 42:42.917
You are out of your mind.

42:42.959 --> 42:46.792
The Sarthongians are merciless

42:42.959 --> 42:46.792
to trespassers.

42:49.125 --> 42:52.375
Why, Jean-Luc...

42:52.417 --> 42:55.750
you really do care about me.

42:57.625 --> 43:02.917
Promise me you will try

42:57.625 --> 43:02.917
and stay out of trouble.

43:02.959 --> 43:06.375
I always try.

43:19.083 --> 43:23.083
I wish we had more time

43:19.083 --> 43:23.083
together.

43:23.125 --> 43:25.583
Well, perhaps we do.

43:25.625 --> 43:29.166
The Vorgons are time travelers.

43:29.208 --> 43:34.834
Now they know where and when

43:29.208 --> 43:34.834
the<i> Uthat</i> can be found

43:34.875 --> 43:38.959
they may very well come back

43:34.875 --> 43:38.959
and try for it again.

43:41.792 --> 43:45.959
So we may be doing this

43:41.792 --> 43:45.959
all over again.

43:54.667 --> 43:56.208
Welcome aboard, Captain.

43:56.250 --> 43:57.959
Status report,

43:56.250 --> 43:57.959
Number One.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.959
All went well

43:58.000 --> 43:59.959
on Starbase 12.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.041
I think you'll find the ship

44:00.000 --> 44:02.041
in splendid condition.

44:02.083 --> 44:04.041
I'll present my compliments

44:02.083 --> 44:04.041
to the crew.

44:04.083 --> 44:06.542
Oh, yes, Number One

44:06.583 --> 44:09.208
about that<i> Horga'hn</i>

44:06.583 --> 44:09.208
you requested.

44:09.250 --> 44:10.875
Yes, sir?

44:10.917 --> 44:13.583
You and I need to have

44:10.917 --> 44:13.583
a little chat about that.

44:13.625 --> 44:17.291
Was it a relaxing

44:13.625 --> 44:17.291
trip, Captain?

44:19.959 --> 44:22.583
Uh-huh.

44:24.500 --> 44:27.625
I knew he'd have a great time.
