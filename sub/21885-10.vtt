WEBVTT

00:13.223 --> 00:14.641
You alright there, chief?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.809
You look like you lost your lucky bookmark
or something.

00:16.851 --> 00:17.852
Oh, no! Did I?

00:20.104 --> 00:21.981
It's fine. I got it right here.

00:22.023 --> 00:25.401
It's just that now
that we're actually on the train

00:25.443 --> 00:27.445
heading to Bad Place headquarters

00:27.487 --> 00:29.531
this plan is starting to feel slightly...

00:30.073 --> 00:31.699
completely insane.

00:31.824 --> 00:34.077
This is the only way to get to the Judge?

00:34.118 --> 00:35.495
I'm afraid so. Yes.

00:35.537 --> 00:38.373
See, the Judge exists in a sort of
neutral zone

00:38.414 --> 00:40.583
separate from the Good Place
and the Bad Place.

00:40.792 --> 00:43.127
The only things there
are the Judge's quarters

00:43.253 --> 00:44.420
the Accounting department

00:44.462 --> 00:45.964
and the Janet Warehouse.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.925
No, there's also an IHOP.

00:48.967 --> 00:51.803
Dope! I'm gonna order
the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity!

00:51.844 --> 00:52.971
No, sorry, um...

00:53.012 --> 00:57.308
in this realm, IHOP stands for
"Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes."

00:57.600 --> 00:59.811
You don't really eat these pancakes

00:59.978 --> 01:01.688
it's more like they eat you.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.565
OK, I'll get eggs then.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.277
So, the only way to get to the Judge
is through a Portal

01:07.318 --> 01:10.405
which is smack dab
in the middle of the main office

01:10.446 --> 01:11.864
at Bad Place headquarters.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.450
And the only way through the Portal
is with one of these.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.370
What is that? Is that jewellery?
Not that it matters.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.664
It's just some jewellery I don't have.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.458
Can I have it?
- These pins are very hard to come by

01:22.709 --> 01:24.961
only upper management-types have them.

01:25.003 --> 01:27.714
So, you guys will lay low,
while I get us four more.

01:27.964 --> 01:30.174
Janet doesn't need one, because for Portals

01:30.216 --> 01:31.843
she counts as a "carry-on."

01:32.218 --> 01:33.261
I'm luggage.

01:33.595 --> 01:36.806
I had Janet make you each
a Bad Place disguise

01:36.848 --> 01:38.891
and everyone who worked in the Neighbourhood

01:38.933 --> 01:41.060
has been sent back
to their previous departments

01:41.102 --> 01:43.938
so the chances of you being recognised
are very small.

01:44.272 --> 01:47.317
I don't know. This plan seems complicated.

01:47.358 --> 01:50.236
To be fair, you also once said that
about an orange.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.571
They don't make sense!

01:51.988 --> 01:55.783
Apples you eat their clothes,
but oranges you don't?

01:55.825 --> 01:56.784
Forget this plan.

01:56.826 --> 01:58.995
I say we just huck a Molotov cocktail and...

01:59.037 --> 02:00.663
Whew! Run through the Portal.

02:00.705 --> 02:05.168
As much as I respect your explosive-based
problem-solving skills

02:05.209 --> 02:07.587
I think we should go with Michael's plan.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.006
I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work.

02:10.048 --> 02:13.593
Any time I had a problem,
and I threw a Molotov cocktail - boom!

02:13.635 --> 02:16.137
right away, I had a different problem.

02:16.679 --> 02:17.930
He makes a strong case.

02:26.064 --> 02:28.483
OK, now, you're all gonna need aliases.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.527
Cool. I'm gonna be... "Diana Tremaine."

02:31.569 --> 02:33.404
That was the name on my fake ID
in high school.

02:33.446 --> 02:36.449
Her address was 123 Whatever Street

02:36.491 --> 02:37.909
Canada City, Canada.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.036
Arizona bouncers are the best.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.455
Character work! Such fun.

02:42.914 --> 02:45.750
I actually dabbled in a bit of acting
after university.

02:45.792 --> 02:49.212
Although, mostly, I just stood around
while Baz Luhrmann just threw glitter on me.

02:49.253 --> 02:52.423
- Ooh, I shall be...
- "Rhonda Mumps"

02:52.465 --> 02:55.593
and I work down at the hot dog factory!
- You need to be more specific.

02:55.635 --> 02:57.762
There are nine hot dog torture departments.

02:57.804 --> 03:01.224
Making people into, stuffing people with...

03:01.474 --> 03:03.101
Ooh, stuffing people sounds fun.

03:03.142 --> 03:05.728
Is that like shoving them into the throats
of vegans?

03:05.937 --> 03:06.813
Yes.

03:07.105 --> 03:07.980
throats.

03:08.398 --> 03:10.024
I know what my secret identity is.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.818
You cannot be "Blake Bortles."

03:11.859 --> 03:13.986
Fine. Then I'll be "Jake."

03:14.028 --> 03:15.738
Don't say "Jortles."
- "Jortles"!

03:15.780 --> 03:18.199
And I work in the Molotov cocktail
department.

03:18.241 --> 03:21.077
Boy, you know, I thought you guys would be
more worried about this.

03:21.119 --> 03:23.746
We've been knee-deep in demons
for, like, 800 reboots now.

03:23.788 --> 03:26.582
- Lying about who we are is second-nature.
- Huh.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.252
Chidi?

03:29.293 --> 03:32.296
I hate this, I hate lying,
it's not permissible, I can't do this!

03:32.338 --> 03:33.214
Oh, boy.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.676
Jeez Louise!

03:36.718 --> 03:39.554
Looks like Chidi has a real case
of the Mondays, am I right?

03:40.513 --> 03:42.473
Hey, uh... pass the Nascar-ketchup!

03:45.226 --> 03:46.227
Hey, buddy.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.773
Look, if you don't want to lie because
it conflicts with your moral principles

03:50.815 --> 03:51.691
I get it.

03:52.734 --> 03:54.152
No one's going to be mad at you.

03:54.527 --> 03:55.403
Really?

03:55.445 --> 03:56.612
No, dumbass!

03:56.654 --> 03:58.698
I'm lying to you to make you feel better!

03:58.740 --> 04:00.408
See? Sometimes lying is awesome!

04:00.450 --> 04:02.285
Plus, I said "dumbass!"

04:02.326 --> 04:04.245
Oh, cursing - how I've missed you.

04:04.412 --> 04:08.082
Look, Eleanor, our goal here is to appear
in front of a Judge

04:08.124 --> 04:10.126
who is going to judge us.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.670
What if I lie down here,
and I lose 12 points

04:12.712 --> 04:15.339
and then we get in front of the Judge
and I'm 12 points short?

04:15.381 --> 04:19.218
Or what if the Judge won't even take our case
at all, because we lied to get there?

04:19.260 --> 04:23.097
Kant says that lying is always wrong
and I follow that maxim.

04:23.139 --> 04:26.142
So, you can't even lie to demons?
They're trying to torture us, man!

04:26.184 --> 04:27.310
We're behind enemy lines!

04:27.351 --> 04:29.687
Look, principles aren't principles
when you pick and choose

04:29.729 --> 04:31.230
when you're going to follow them.

04:32.023 --> 04:34.066
I won't lie about who I am.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.319
OK.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.948
I understand, and I'm cool with it.

04:41.324 --> 04:44.285
You're lying right now, aren't you?
- Yes, I wanna strangle you.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.248
What even is this thing?

04:50.374 --> 04:51.542
I hate suits.

04:51.793 --> 04:54.545
They remind me of court,
and going to court

04:54.879 --> 04:58.174
and being my own lawyer
against the advice of the judge in court

04:58.591 --> 05:00.718
and getting immediately convicted in court.

05:01.177 --> 05:02.386
I think you look nice.

05:03.054 --> 05:04.222
I think you look sexy.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.557
Here.

05:06.599 --> 05:09.644
I got you this to help your disguise.
- Whoa, a briefcase?

05:10.853 --> 05:13.648
"Take my credit card to the hedge fund.
I'll meet you at the martini store."

05:13.689 --> 05:15.817
Oh, you're gonna get caught.
Give me the briefcase back. Thanks.

05:16.317 --> 05:17.193
Aw...

05:17.276 --> 05:19.737
Janet, you need to get in character, too.

05:19.779 --> 05:23.199
Now, I know you look like a Bad Janet
but can you act like one?

05:23.407 --> 05:24.784
I have gained a lot of new skills recently.

05:24.826 --> 05:27.119
For example, I learned how to be
passive aggressive.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.121
Totally fine that you guys haven't noticed.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.457
Oh!
- Well, let's practice.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.375
OK.

05:32.416 --> 05:33.835
I'm going to make a simple request

05:33.876 --> 05:36.629
and you're going to give me that patented
"Bad Janet" attitude.

05:36.671 --> 05:38.923
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Here you go.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.049
No.

05:40.091 --> 05:41.634
Let's try again. Be mean!

05:41.676 --> 05:45.096
Bad Janet, can I have a glass of water?

05:45.596 --> 05:46.556
No.

05:46.848 --> 05:49.267
I would never give you that, you...

05:50.434 --> 05:51.644
dumb person.

05:51.686 --> 05:53.563
Janet, what's that behind your back?
- Nothing.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.189
Give it to me.
- It's a glass of water.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.274
Oh...

05:56.482 --> 05:58.442
And a back-up glass. Oh, boy...
- Oh!

05:59.527 --> 06:01.445
It's OK, we'll keep working.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.072
OK.
- You'll get the hang of it

06:03.114 --> 06:07.410
Or my name isn't Rhonda Apple Pie
Spiderman Mumps.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.537
We're here.

06:11.289 --> 06:14.584
All trains today are delayed
by three hours.

06:15.001 --> 06:17.044
Just like they are every day.

06:18.045 --> 06:22.008
All passengers, you all suck and you're ugly.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.634
Keep walking.

06:23.676 --> 06:25.887
Again. You all suck...
- Keep your heads down.

06:26.137 --> 06:27.680
...and you are ugly.

06:27.722 --> 06:29.515
Just act unnatural.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.311
Hey, guys.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.022
So, you wait here, while I go get us
some more of these pins.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.149
But what is this place?
- It's just a place.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.694
You know, an area, or "location."
It's pretty straightforward.

06:41.736 --> 06:43.404
"The Museum of Human Misery?"

06:43.446 --> 06:44.989
Oh. Yeah, OK.

06:45.031 --> 06:46.365
It's a torture museum.

06:46.407 --> 06:50.620
Famous examples of bad behaviour,
and explanations of the torture they earned.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.914
Is there a gift shop?
- Jason, this is Hell.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.832
Of course there's a gift shop.

06:54.874 --> 06:59.837
It's the least horrifying room.
It's the "Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness."

07:01.714 --> 07:04.592
"First person to floss
in an open-plan office."

07:08.554 --> 07:11.265
Well, she deserves to be tortured -
she's a monster.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.351
This was the safest place I could think of

07:13.392 --> 07:14.727
no one ever comes in here.

07:14.769 --> 07:17.104
Guys, if you do leave this room

07:17.146 --> 07:20.149
you're gonna see things
that will haunt you for eternity.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.652
OK, back soon. Bye.

07:22.693 --> 07:23.861
Hey, hey.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.655
Be careful. OK?

07:27.073 --> 07:28.574
"Be careful"?

07:28.783 --> 07:29.700
Yeah.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.995
Oh, Eleanor, are you worried about me?

07:34.330 --> 07:35.498
Yeah, I'm worried.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.167
I mean, cos you're our ticket
out of here, genius.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.211
Don't go getting all goopy on me.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.504
No, worry about them. I'll be fine.

07:41.963 --> 07:42.964
OK.

07:47.718 --> 07:51.514
"First man to send an unsolicited picture
of his genitals."

07:56.602 --> 07:58.187
Heh... heh... heh...

07:58.562 --> 08:01.565
"First waiter to approach a diner
with an empty plate"

08:01.607 --> 08:06.195
"and, sarcastically, say,
'I guess you hated it.'"

08:06.237 --> 08:08.489
"First white person to grow dreadlocks."

08:08.864 --> 08:12.201
And first person to call ultimate Frisbee
"ultimate"!

08:12.243 --> 08:13.577
This dude rules!

08:13.869 --> 08:15.538
Alright, everyone...

08:15.579 --> 08:16.747
we've got a lot of work to do.

08:16.789 --> 08:19.500
Why don't you set up the bar over by that wall?

08:19.583 --> 08:23.963
Why don't you roll off your mum
and do it yourself, ya fat dink?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.302
Set up more of those tables.
We're expecting a big crowd.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.721
You got it, you piece of...

08:32.972 --> 08:34.098
butt.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.641
Son of a bitch!

08:35.808 --> 08:39.895
Still happy I can swear now,
but everything else about this is very bad.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.401
Hey, boss.

08:45.443 --> 08:46.402
I'm back.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.195
Welcome home. Axe up.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.073
Ho! New scent.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.992
"Transformers."
- Yes.

08:53.034 --> 08:55.870
It makes you smell the way "Transformers"
movies make you feel.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.372
Still can't believe those jack-offs
got away from us.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.915
Really zips my tip.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.125
Yeah.
- Anyway...

09:01.167 --> 09:04.628
I drew up some extradition papers
to get them back from Mindy's.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.298
I think I'll take a few
of my most trusted staff

09:07.339 --> 09:10.217
hop in the Portal, file those with the Judge

09:10.634 --> 09:12.053
quick stop for pancakes

09:12.386 --> 09:13.846
and then I'll head on back.

09:13.888 --> 09:15.556
By the way, I'm gonna need, uh...

09:15.598 --> 09:17.516
four pins, for my crew.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.852
This is very thorough, however...

09:21.645 --> 09:25.191
Is that where we're putting
top-priority files nowadays?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.901
We won't need extradition papers.

09:27.526 --> 09:31.238
Plans are already in motion
to get the humans back in a different way.

09:31.739 --> 09:32.615
Ah.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.954
Oh man, this is not good.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.458
This is noooot good!

09:42.541 --> 09:45.586
Would you chill out?
Haven't you ever crashed a party before?

09:45.628 --> 09:48.130
No! I've only been to like,
four parties total

09:48.172 --> 09:50.758
and all of them were thrown by Tahani
after I was already dead.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.303
Alright, well, we can't just stand here
in a group, looks too conspicuous.

09:54.345 --> 09:56.597
I'll go with Tahani, Chidi go with Jason.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.934
That way, Jason's unearned confidence
let's him do all the talking

09:59.975 --> 10:01.685
and you don't have to lie. OK?

10:01.727 --> 10:03.729
Come on, Diana!
Let's hit the bar!

10:03.771 --> 10:06.482
I'm gonna get me a tall glass
of pipin' hot corn syrup

10:06.524 --> 10:09.068
and a scooter so I can roll around the mall!

10:09.735 --> 10:10.861
That's really good.
- Thank you.

10:11.737 --> 10:12.613
Hors d'oeuvre?

10:12.905 --> 10:13.989
Ooh, what do you got?

10:14.406 --> 10:16.534
Soul food from Maine, bagels from Arkansas

10:16.575 --> 10:17.910
Hawaiian pizza, of course

10:17.952 --> 10:21.288
and egg salad from a hospital vending machine
in Azerbaijan.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.498
Uh, that!

10:22.748 --> 10:23.916
Have a terrible evening.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.336
No way! Trent? Is that you?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.630
Uh, who else could it be?

10:29.672 --> 10:32.591
Come on. Tap it out. Boom-boom!

10:33.008 --> 10:34.426
Whassup? I'm Chet.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.346
Jake is my name,
Molotov cocktails is my game.

10:37.805 --> 10:41.350
I think school is lame, I gotta tattoo
of David Blaine! What!

10:41.392 --> 10:42.643
Whoo! Tight!

10:42.685 --> 10:44.186
Ball tap!

10:44.436 --> 10:45.938
Dip! Ball tap!

10:46.355 --> 10:48.649
Oh! That's a firm ball tap, bro.

10:48.983 --> 10:52.862
Anyway, cha'boy Trent and I worked together
in Partial Decapitations.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.114
When did you leave de-cap?
800 years ago?

10:55.156 --> 10:56.532
Uh, something like that.

10:56.574 --> 10:59.160
I just joined a new department -
Toxic Masculinity.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.453
We torture internet trolls, frat dudes.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.497
It actually started as a training program

11:03.539 --> 11:05.332
to prep for when
the "Girls Gone Wild" dude gets here.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.667
Joe Francis!
- The one.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.877
Legend!

11:07.918 --> 11:09.295
Ha-ha! Bro-hams!

11:09.461 --> 11:11.172
Get over here and meet my top dog, Trent.

11:11.422 --> 11:13.549
Dude's a straight beast
when it comes to torture!

11:13.591 --> 11:14.466
Sup, bro?
- Sup, bro?

11:14.508 --> 11:17.136
It's actually pretty choice that we're
running into you right now.

11:17.178 --> 11:20.055
My top dog Dirk here,
he got stuck with a new case.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.683
He can't crack it. Hit 'em with it, D-Money.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.144
So, I'm trying to torture
this guy, right, Brant.

11:25.436 --> 11:29.273
Brant was a total lord - he got kicked off
of Rob Gronkowski's party cruise

11:29.315 --> 11:32.818
for throwing a lobster at a stripper,
and then he died doing a keg stand

11:32.860 --> 11:34.361
in the back of a moving Jeep Wrangler.

11:34.570 --> 11:37.114
Anyways, we run a couple hundred
torture scenarios

11:37.156 --> 11:40.534
none of them seemed quite right, you know?
Think we can get you to crack this nut?

11:40.576 --> 11:42.411
Well, I mean, how... how can I say no?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.872
Yeah, I know how I would say no.

11:44.914 --> 11:45.789
You know, I'd be all like...

11:45.831 --> 11:46.707
"No!"

11:46.749 --> 11:48.083
But... You know, I can't.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.419
You're so weird, Trent, man.
You're always so weird.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.296
I love that about you.
- Yeah...

11:52.338 --> 11:55.174
Don't get me wrong,
I love shoving hot dogs into people

11:55.216 --> 11:59.220
But once you've dogged every hole, you just
start to feel like you're repeating yourself.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.137
Whew. I hear that, sister.

12:00.179 --> 12:02.014
I'm gonna go take a dump -
you want me to grab you one?

12:02.056 --> 12:03.182
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

12:03.224 --> 12:04.975
Not even a little nug?
- Nah, I'm 'aight.

12:05.017 --> 12:05.851
Alright.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.394
Damn, you're good at this.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.481
Well, hang out with Johnny Depp long enough
and you become pretty good at lying.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.401
Like, "No, your whole thing isn't
exhausting at all!"

12:14.443 --> 12:18.572
Hi there, you big stinky poop-face guys!

12:18.614 --> 12:19.823
Ugh, it's me - Good Janet!

12:19.865 --> 12:21.575
I'm sorry I called you big stinky
poop-face guys.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.245
That's OK. Janet,
can you dig around a little bit

12:24.286 --> 12:28.040
and find out what this event is,
and how long it's gonna last?

12:28.082 --> 12:31.835
I'd love to! Punch your... teeth!

12:32.044 --> 12:32.920
Hey.

12:33.254 --> 12:34.129
Teeth...

12:36.799 --> 12:37.800
What's all this?

12:37.841 --> 12:41.679
Well, I was going to try to get the humans
back by going through the proper channels

12:41.720 --> 12:42.805
but then I remembered -

12:43.764 --> 12:45.015
I'm a naughty bitch.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.392
So...

12:46.433 --> 12:49.520
I sent a black ops team to Mindy's,
to... "extract" them.

12:49.687 --> 12:52.648
Nobody from the Bad Place
is allowed in Mindy's Neighbourhood.

12:52.690 --> 12:55.192
You can't do that, Shawn.
It's... it's... it's illegal!

12:55.234 --> 12:56.110
Oh, no.

12:56.151 --> 12:59.780
Guys, Michael says this is illegal.
I hadn't thought of that.

13:01.282 --> 13:03.492
That was sarcasm - I had thought of that.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.869
Listen, your experiment blew up in our faces.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.205
The example I made out of Vicky ensured
that everybody from the Neighbourhood

13:08.247 --> 13:09.832
has kept their mouths shut,
but we're not out of the woods

13:09.873 --> 13:11.542
until those four are back in custody.

13:11.583 --> 13:15.379
So, I rounded up some loyal friends,
and took matters into my own hands.

13:15.754 --> 13:19.842
Relax, Mike. This will all be over soon,
and we can all head down to the museum.

13:21.302 --> 13:22.303
The museum?

13:22.344 --> 13:24.972
Yes. Your Neighborhood - our Neighborhood

13:25.306 --> 13:27.474
is being immortalised for its success.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.018
It's all gonna work out.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.021
I took the form of a 45-year-old
white man for a reason -

13:32.062 --> 13:33.439
I can only fail up.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.650
Oh, OK, our team is five minutes out.

13:36.692 --> 13:38.944
Bad Janet, burn us some popcorn.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.824
Help yourselves, everybody.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.910
Hey! Hi. So, um...

13:46.952 --> 13:49.455
those bro demons over there
think I'm some kind of great torturer

13:49.496 --> 13:51.540
and they want my advice
on how to torture someone.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.835
Jason is stalling by ranking
MMA ring girls with them

13:54.877 --> 13:56.170
but I have to do something.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.505
Eleanor, you're wearing glasses now, help me!

13:58.547 --> 14:00.007
You know the answer, dude.

14:00.049 --> 14:03.052
Lie your ass off.
If Rhonda can do it, you can.

14:03.385 --> 14:07.431
You know, I once shoved a hot dog right down
the throat of the legendary John Wayne.

14:08.182 --> 14:09.641
She even name-drops in Hell.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.727
I told you, lies have consequences!

14:11.769 --> 14:13.854
I will have contributed
to someone's eternal torture

14:13.896 --> 14:16.815
because I disobeyed a basic Kantian
moral principle.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.150
I'm gonna be sick.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.694
And I don't want to go back to the bathroom
because they put mirrors in the toilet

14:20.736 --> 14:22.237
and that makes you really confront
what you're doing!

14:22.279 --> 14:25.366
OK, OK. Sit down. Take a breath.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.410
Rub your lucky bookmark. Hear me out.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.706
What if lying is ethical, in this situation?

14:32.748 --> 14:36.251
What if, uh... certain actions
aren't universally good or bad

14:36.293 --> 14:37.753
like Jonathan Dancy says?

14:38.837 --> 14:42.216
Jonathan Dancy? Are... are you talking about
moral particularism?

14:42.257 --> 14:43.509
We never even covered that.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.678
You read on your own!

14:46.720 --> 14:49.973
You think just because I'm a straight hottie
I can't read philosophy for fun?

14:50.391 --> 14:51.266
I...
- Look.

14:51.308 --> 14:56.688
Moral particularism says there are
no fixed rules that work in every situation.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.733
Like, let's say you... you promised your
friend you'd go to the movies

14:59.900 --> 15:02.403
but then your mum suddenly gets rushed
to the ER?

15:02.444 --> 15:05.406
Your boy Kant would say,
"never break a promise."

15:05.656 --> 15:08.826
"Go see 'Chronicles of Riddick,'
doesn't matter if your mom gets lonely"

15:08.867 --> 15:10.953
"and steals a bucket of Vicodin
from the nurse's closet."

15:10.994 --> 15:11.995
Real example?
- Yep.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.790
But a moral particularist - like me

15:15.082 --> 15:16.708
I'm one now, I just decided

15:16.834 --> 15:21.338
would say, "There's no absolute rule,
you have to choose your actions"

15:21.380 --> 15:23.424
"based on the particular situation."

15:23.465 --> 15:26.468
And right now,
we are in a pretty bonkers situation.

15:26.802 --> 15:30.055
I don't think I can change what I believe,
just like that.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.767
And I didn't think I would ever
be at a cocktail party in literal Hell

15:33.809 --> 15:37.146
lecturing my teacher-slash-ex-lover
about moral particularism

15:37.187 --> 15:38.772
but life throws you curveballs, bro!

15:39.064 --> 15:42.526
And need I remind you, it was doing things
your way that made you end up here.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.571
Hey, man! Get back over there, dog!

15:46.905 --> 15:47.781
Damn...

15:47.906 --> 15:49.074
You got that good stank.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.659
Thanks. Right back at you, bud.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.286
Smash you later. Let's roll.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.172
Hey, bu... ass!

16:03.714 --> 16:04.673
Butt-ass.

16:04.715 --> 16:07.468
How long is this stupid event
supposed to last, anyway?

16:07.509 --> 16:09.178
They're unveiling the exhibit in ten minutes

16:09.219 --> 16:11.513
then everyone'll get drunk
and poke each other with hot sticks

16:11.555 --> 16:12.473
and then it'll be over.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.057
Farts.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.229
Uh-oh.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.982
Bad Janet? Walkie-Talkie Mode.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.028
Now entering Mindy St Claire's house.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.488
This is so exciting!

16:27.738 --> 16:29.198
I hope everyone gets hurt!

16:29.239 --> 16:31.492
Living room is clear. Entering the bedroom.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.826
Oh, yeah!

16:32.868 --> 16:34.369
- Ow.
- Oh, God!

16:34.411 --> 16:36.246
This feels so weird!

16:36.288 --> 16:38.457
- Here we go.
- Oh! Do some coke off my butt!

16:38.499 --> 16:41.668
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa! Who are you guys?
- Oh! Friends!

16:41.710 --> 16:42.586
Hi, I'm Derek.

16:43.504 --> 16:46.089
Where are the humans? And who is Derek?

16:46.131 --> 16:48.675
Me is Derek. These are my wind chimes.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.844
Uh, oh! Oh! My wind chimes like you.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.971
The only people here are Mindy St Claire

16:53.013 --> 16:55.182
and an unknown male with a genital deformity.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.725
The four humans are not here.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.811
Where is Michael?

17:00.187 --> 17:01.855
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy...

17:02.314 --> 17:03.315
Hey there, Mike.

17:03.357 --> 17:05.400
Hey, Lance! Lookin' good, buddy!

17:05.442 --> 17:07.277
Lose some weight?
- Heh! I wish.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.195
Listen up, people.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.239
We need to find Michael,
and we need to be discrete.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.534
You, search from the spastic dentistry
department down through "disembowelment."

17:13.575 --> 17:17.246
You, cover "children's dance recitals"
through "Holiday Weekend Ikea." Go!

17:18.247 --> 17:22.209
Hey, hey, hey! Found him.
He was birddogging some tail.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.585
Yeah, what you got for me, Trent?

17:25.379 --> 17:29.258
Well, peep this, dawg.
You really wanna torture this dirtbag?

17:30.425 --> 17:31.343
You give him books.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.136
I'm serious.

17:33.387 --> 17:38.267
This one time I was assigned this, uh...
chick that I... I had to torture

17:38.308 --> 17:40.519
and I just couldn't figure it out.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.397
And then I realized - she hated books.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.400
So, I just gave her mad books to read,
around the clock.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.027
And the books, like... exploded?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.153
No, no, no, no, uh...

17:50.195 --> 17:52.823
they were just you know, uh...
regular moral philosophy books.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.700
You know, everyone hates moral philosophers.

17:54.950 --> 17:55.826
That is true.

17:55.951 --> 17:59.746
And I... I know it's wild, but, you know,
sometimes you gotta think outside the bun.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.164
Whoo!
- Ah, sick Taco Bell ref.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.124
Very nice.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.585
But I don't know, man.
It sounds kind of lame.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.128
This guy's the best? Really?

18:08.255 --> 18:10.299
Yeah, you know, maybe I don't know
what I'm talking ab--

18:10.340 --> 18:11.717
ball tap!

18:13.552 --> 18:15.846
That's what you get for questioning Trent!

18:15.887 --> 18:17.180
The torture master!

18:17.222 --> 18:18.640
He got you so bad!

18:19.016 --> 18:20.851
He did. He did. Nice job, bro.

18:21.476 --> 18:24.021
Alright, you've convinced me.
I'll give him books.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.358
Hey, you two.
Get your ugly necks over here.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.904
Guys, I found something very bad.
We have to get out of here right now.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.781
Alright, everybody gather around.
Gather round.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.199
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.368
What do we do?
- Just don't draw attention.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.621
Whatever this is, it'll be over in a second
and we can sneak out the door.

18:40.662 --> 18:44.374
Feast your eyes on the newest exhibit here
at The Museum of Human Misery.

18:44.416 --> 18:48.795
The Residents of Neighborhood 12358W.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.258
Oh, no.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.427
Is that what they think my hair looks like?

18:55.469 --> 19:00.849
This game-changing experiment chose
four humans and had them torture each other.

19:01.183 --> 19:05.145
It's already led to major breakthroughs
in the future of our industry.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.065
Now, obviously we couldn't get
the actual four idiots

19:08.106 --> 19:11.610
as they're off being tortured,
so we cooked up the next best thing.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.570
- Wanna meet them?
- Yes!

19:13.612 --> 19:17.240
I'm Tahani Al-Jamil, a vainglorious
attention-seeker

19:17.282 --> 19:20.869
with enough jealousy to power Elon Musk's
underwater mansion

19:21.411 --> 19:22.788
which I've been to, by the way!

19:23.955 --> 19:26.541
I have, actually. It's remarkable.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.793
It's remarkable.

19:29.169 --> 19:33.882
I'm Chidi Anagonye. Or maybe I'm not.
I can't decide anything.

19:33.924 --> 19:35.717
Or maybe I can.

19:36.134 --> 19:40.597
Ah! I can't decide! My stomach hurts!

19:43.350 --> 19:46.228
What? They kinda nailed it.
I've heard you say all that stuff.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.813
I'm Eleanor Shellstrop

19:48.021 --> 19:52.234
I mock others to distract myself
from the emptiness inside me.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.568
That's fair, that's fair.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.404
I'm Jason Mendoza.

19:56.530 --> 19:57.656
Duh!

19:59.074 --> 19:59.950
That's me.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.119
Hey, where have you been?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.205
Ooh! How do you smell loud and confusing?

20:05.247 --> 20:07.833
No time to explain. We gotta go.
I got the travel pins.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.293
Yo! That looks like my boy Trent.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.129
And isn't that Rhonda Mumps?

20:12.170 --> 20:13.130
Come on!

20:13.171 --> 20:14.756
There he is.
- Uh-oh!

20:14.798 --> 20:16.341
And he's got the humans with him.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.801
Alright, let's just back up here.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.094
What do we do?

20:19.636 --> 20:20.512
This!

20:23.515 --> 20:25.642
Jortles!

20:27.394 --> 20:28.270
Go!

20:30.856 --> 20:32.274
Hey, Eleanor, thanks for the advice.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.443
It was really helpful. Even though I had to
say a lot of words I don't like

20:34.484 --> 20:36.611
like "douche," and "chick," and "peep this."
- OK, great. No problem.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.488
I'm just kind of focused on
running right now!

20:43.118 --> 20:45.245
Here. Put the pins on your lapels.

20:45.954 --> 20:46.830
OK, OK...

20:46.872 --> 20:48.540
Uh, you didn't give me a pin, man.
I don't have one.

20:48.832 --> 20:49.958
OK, OK. Hang on. Hang on.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.042
Hey, where's Janet?

20:51.084 --> 20:53.962
No time to wait for her.
You three go, now. Now!

21:00.886 --> 21:01.845
Portals!

21:03.305 --> 21:04.598
Any day now, man!

21:04.723 --> 21:05.599
Hey!

21:08.018 --> 21:09.060
Hey, guess what?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.731
I just solved the Trolley Problem.

21:13.899 --> 21:17.152
Remember? The thought experiment,
where you're driving the trolley

21:17.194 --> 21:21.782
and you're gonna either plough into a group
of people, or turn and hit one person?

21:22.449 --> 21:23.325
I solved it.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.285
That's really great.
But I don't think now's the time.

21:25.327 --> 21:28.663
See, the Trolley Problem forces you to choose
between two versions

21:28.705 --> 21:30.332
of letting other people die.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.751
And the actual solution is very simple

21:34.795 --> 21:36.213
sacrifice yourself.

21:36.254 --> 21:37.172
What does that mean?

21:39.549 --> 21:40.884
You look after the others.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.177
They need you.
- No.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.137
Step away from the portal!

21:44.179 --> 21:45.597
Goodbye, Eleanor.
- No, no, wait!

21:45.639 --> 21:46.640
Wait!

21:51.645 --> 21:52.521
Hey, boss.

21:52.813 --> 21:53.897
What's up?
