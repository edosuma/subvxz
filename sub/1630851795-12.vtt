00:06.140 --> 00:08.874
<i> [narrator] this time</i>
<i>  on moonshiners...</i>

00:08.876 --> 00:09.942
[digger] oh, it's spongy.

00:09.944 --> 00:11.477
Full of juice.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.945
<i>  We getting ready</i>
<i>  to mash all this in.</i>

00:12.947 --> 00:16.015
The sugar cane needs
nothing else except
add it to the mash,

00:16.017 --> 00:17.916
but these cherries
are a little different story.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.786
We're making us some
hillbilly cajun cognac.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.954
Whoa!

00:22.189 --> 00:23.489
What do you think, brother?

00:23.491 --> 00:24.623
Son, I'm digging this.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.225
<i>  We're back in tennessee now.</i>

00:26.227 --> 00:29.028
It feels like a big
accomplishment
to have this still set up.

00:29.030 --> 00:29.895
That good?

00:29.897 --> 00:30.462
Jerry!

00:30.464 --> 00:32.031
Oh, [bleep]!

00:32.033 --> 00:34.600
So I'm dying to see
this infusion thing
that you have made, huck.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.035
[mark rogers speaking]

00:36.037 --> 00:38.337
[amanda] I don't think
it's gonna shoot off
or anything,

00:38.339 --> 00:39.872
but it's just... Let's not
stand in front of it.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.041
[hissing]

00:43.077 --> 00:46.111
<i> [man] this is how we make</i>
<i>  the moonshine!</i>

00:59.060 --> 01:01.126
Boy, that sugarcane
cutting me up.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.261
Yeah, you get in there

01:02.430 --> 01:04.630
and you fight that stuff.

01:04.632 --> 01:09.234
<i> [narrator] on the shores</i>
<i>  of the gulf coast</i>
<i>  in iberia parish, louisiana,</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:11.470
<i>  richard and craig</i>
<i>  harvest sugarcane</i>

01:11.472 --> 01:16.542
<i>  in advance of their trip</i>
<i>  to work with mark and digger</i>
<i>  on a run of cherry cognac.</i>

01:16.544 --> 01:19.511
Yeah, this is 10 times better
than going to the store
and buying sugar.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.648
Like, the sugar content
in this right here is so pure.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.984
I called mark and digger
for advice on how to make
a cherry cognac,

01:25.986 --> 01:28.654
and these guys said, "hey,
come up here and we'll
make it together."

01:28.656 --> 01:30.489
<i> [craig] we're in southwest</i>
<i>  louisiana.</i>

01:30.491 --> 01:32.658
<i>  Everywhere you turn</i>
<i>  is a sugarcane field,</i>

01:32.660 --> 01:34.893
<i>  so I think the best way</i>
<i>  to make this cognac</i>

01:34.895 --> 01:36.862
would be with some
louisiana sugarcane.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.998
Feel like
I'm in the cornfield, man.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.968
Anytime we don't have
to buy anything to make a real
high quality liquor out of it,

01:42.970 --> 01:44.470
I mean, I'm game for that.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.939
<i>  The less money you spend,</i>
<i>  the more money you make.</i>

01:46.941 --> 01:50.576
<i>  Yeah, this is 10 times better</i>
<i>  than going to the store</i>
<i>  and buying sugar.</i>

01:50.578 --> 01:53.846
<i>  Like, the sugar content</i>
<i> in this right here is so pure.</i>

01:53.848 --> 01:58.750
<i> This is one of the only places</i>
<i>  I've ever seen me be able</i>
<i>  to walk up to a sugarcane</i>

01:58.752 --> 02:01.186
<i> and excrete sugar that easily.</i>

02:02.857 --> 02:05.357
<i>  I wouldn't even know how much</i>
<i>  this would be if I had</i>
<i>  to buy this in the store.</i>

02:05.359 --> 02:08.160
<i>  It would probably be</i>
<i>  in some high-end product,</i>

02:08.162 --> 02:11.597
<i>  'cause this is pure sugar</i>
<i>  without a molassesy,</i>
<i>  cane taste.</i>

02:11.599 --> 02:13.365
<i>  This is good sugarcane.</i>

02:13.367 --> 02:15.801
That's something
that's real hard to get
in alcohol production.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.871
A lot of people
don't take advantage of this
and we exploit it.

02:18.873 --> 02:19.872
<i>  That's why our alcohol</i>
<i>  is different.</i>

02:19.874 --> 02:21.006
<i>  That's why it tastes</i>
<i>  different.</i>

02:21.008 --> 02:23.342
<i>  That's why it tastes</i>
<i>  clean and clear.</i>

02:23.344 --> 02:25.978
<i>  The sugars that we use</i>
<i>  are clean and clear.</i>

02:25.980 --> 02:28.614
<i>  But mark and digger said</i>
<i> they want something different,</i>

02:28.616 --> 02:31.817
<i>  we gonna give 'em something</i>
<i>  definitely different.</i>

02:31.819 --> 02:33.318
Thought cutting it
was the hard part?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.320
Loading is gonna be hard, too.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.957
Mark and digger have
forgotten more about alcohol
than I'll probably ever know,

02:38.959 --> 02:42.794
so any bit or piece
that I get to learn
from them,

02:42.796 --> 02:43.996
lord, I take advantage of.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.998
<i>  So now I'm gonna</i>
<i>  get the cherries.</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:47.966
Trip to tennessee. Let's go.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.316
[lora] hey, marky.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.851
-[rogers] hey!
-About time
you got here.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.753
Yeah. Finally got here.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.589
-We got some good pears here.
-Got there some pecans.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.658
<i> [narrator] in graham county,</i>

03:24.838 --> 03:27.206
<i>  We're gonna see if we can</i>
<i>  get some good, ripe pears,</i>

03:27.474 --> 03:28.874
see what we can do with.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.643
-[lora] catch, marky.
-[all laughing]

03:31.645 --> 03:35.013
-[lora] see if you can hit
the bucket. There we go!
-[all laughing]

03:35.015 --> 03:38.050
these pear trees,
they've been down at my dad's
for about 50 years,

03:38.052 --> 03:39.818
<i>  and they're</i>
<i>  the old-timey pears,</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:41.687
<i>  and these are hard to find.</i>

03:41.689 --> 03:44.389
<i>  They have a lot of juice.</i>
<i>  They're really good tasting.</i>

03:49.930 --> 03:51.630
No, he drank some
with his friends.

03:51.632 --> 03:55.634
Some moonshine
and whatever else
when he was younger.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.037
When you're younger,
you're always in your wilder
days anyway, most of the time.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.774
-I'm just getting in my prime.
I'm getting started.
-[lora laughs]

04:02.776 --> 04:04.476
[lora] if he was
still here, he'd say,

04:04.478 --> 04:06.578
"well, you gotta
give me a jug or two,
so I can keep it for..."

04:06.580 --> 04:08.447
-well, you know
we'd give him a drink...
-Yeah.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.816
-...Anytime he wanted it.
-[lora laughs] yeah.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.919
<i> [huck] lora, she really enjoys</i>
<i>  being around these trees,</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:15.654
<i>  and, uh, when</i>
<i>  we get all these pears,</i>

04:15.656 --> 04:18.023
we're gonna have
some different flavors,

04:18.025 --> 04:22.861
and, uh, I think we're gonna
have a lot of happy people
to deal with.

04:22.863 --> 04:23.962
[rogers] they're good
and ripe, ain't they?

04:23.964 --> 04:24.997
When I was a little girl,

04:24.999 --> 04:27.499
I always followed daddy
around in the yard

04:27.501 --> 04:29.468
and he showed me
stuff about grafting.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.603
[rogers] what is
grafting, anyway?

04:31.605 --> 04:34.439
You gotta have
the same kind of tree,
a apple or a apple,

04:34.942 --> 04:38.710
and the tree
that you're gonna graft to,

04:38.712 --> 04:41.680
you cut a little bit
of the branch off
and then you wedge it.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.882
You just put it in there
like a little puzzle,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.151
and then later,
when it produces,

04:46.720 --> 04:47.853
it has a little bit of flavor.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.956
It's got a flavor
mixed in with the tree
you grafted it to

04:50.958 --> 04:52.491
and then the tree
you took it off of.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.592
What about that?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.093
[lora] think that's
all of 'em.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.762
[rogers] well,
let's load 'em up,
get 'em back,

04:56.764 --> 04:58.063
and see if we can
get 'em worked up.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.333
These pears, we're gonna
try to work our corn in

05:01.335 --> 05:03.468
and we'll see
how it turns out.

05:03.470 --> 05:07.172
[huck] I think I can do this
on a lot larger scale
and a lot quicker.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.541
Well, we'll get
the little scientist,
amanda, back.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.710
Make sure we'll do it right,

05:11.712 --> 05:13.912
-'cause I don't understand
the science behind this.
-I don't either.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.614
I don't know nothing about it.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.316
I just let it ferment
and dump it in the pot.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.951
Yeah, moonshiners, they help
one another out, you know.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.987
<i>  Amanda, if she can</i>
<i>  come up with something</i>
<i>  better than I can,</i>

05:21.989 --> 05:23.455
I'm all for it.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.657
<i>  She got all kinds</i>
<i>  of little gadgets</i>

05:25.659 --> 05:29.027
<i>  and trinkets, you know,</i>
<i>  little cups, bottles of gas.</i>

05:29.029 --> 05:31.930
<i>  Lot like being</i>
<i>  in a science lab.</i>

05:31.932 --> 05:33.765
I'll call her and see
what she says.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.100
[huck] okay. I'll see you.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.680
[digger] he'd better
hurry or we're gonna
melt here in this sun.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.783
There won't be nothing here
but a puddle of grease
that's left of me and you.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.618
-Damn.
-And two big chicharrons.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.221
-[laughs]
-[mark ramsey] oh,
look at there.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.425
Man, I'm glad
I finally got here, man.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.861
-Like a marathon, wasn't it?
-[richard] yeah.
How y'all doing?

06:02.863 --> 06:06.765
We're really, really
excited about getting
richard here with us.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.801
We're gonna try to run
a run of cherry cognac.

06:09.803 --> 06:10.902
I brought some grass
with me, man.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.905
You got that grass on steroid.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.441
That...
That's definitely what it is.
Look at this stuff here.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.642
Wow.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.944
[richard] this
is louisiana sugarcane.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.747
Digger and I,
we've never worked
with sugarcane whatsoever,

06:21.749 --> 06:25.350
and we're really excited
about seeing what
we can learn from him.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.586
Now, they make sure
that they get real high
sugar production out of this.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.087
Yeah.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.655
It's not like it was back
in the days when you just
planted the stuff.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.191
They put some science,
they put some math into it.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.061
-They try to figure out--
-like everything else,
they're genetically modified

06:36.063 --> 06:37.763
-where it'll produce more.
-[ramsey] more sugar.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.630
Less...

06:38.632 --> 06:39.664
-Less head.
-[ramsey] raw product.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.900
It feels like it's dry
as a cinder to us,

06:41.902 --> 06:45.971
but he assures us
it is full of liquid sugar.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.939
[richard] lemme show
you what I got in here
for you, though.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.474
Oh, my!

06:49.476 --> 06:50.742
-Holy moly!
-What you think
about that?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.745
-[ramsey] look
how pretty them are!
-[digger] look at yonder.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.015
[richard] this should make
a real fine drink, right here.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.584
-[ramsey] oh,
them are nice.
-Mmm.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.953
-[digger] mmm-hmm.
-Damn, them is excellent.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.990
Don't eat no more
of them now, puss,
that's gotta be in our liquor.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.025
You know, technically,
it won't be cognac,

07:07.027 --> 07:10.061
because the grapes for cognac
have to come

07:10.063 --> 07:12.097
-from the cognac
region of France.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.566
So we're just gonna
call this something else.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.501
We'll call it
hillbilly cajun cognac,

07:16.503 --> 07:19.004
-how 'bout that?
-That sounds
real good, right there.

07:19.006 --> 07:23.842
I promise you the cognac
that's made today does not
taste like the first cognac.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.111
It evolves, you know,
it changes.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.513
So why can't it change
with fruits as well?

07:28.515 --> 07:31.883
Our first business,
we gotta get that sugar
out of that cane.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.653
I got a sugarcane presser.
At home, that's what
I do with it.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.620
Run it through a press.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.522
Well, why didn't you
bring it with you?

07:37.524 --> 07:39.724
Oh, it's a little too big
to put in that little truck
right there.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.194
Well, how we gonna squeeze
it if we don't got no press?

07:42.196 --> 07:44.663
Well, I'm gonna go
to the store and I'm
gonna get some pipes,

07:44.665 --> 07:47.799
and we'll build
something that's like
an old clothes wringer.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.935
Why don't we just use
an old clothes wringer?

07:49.937 --> 07:51.937
Oh, there's plenty of them
old things around here.

07:51.939 --> 07:52.938
And we don't have
to build nothing.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.240
That'll cut a day
off of our worries.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.509
There's one over at popcorn's
if it ain't rotted apart.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.245
He used one of them
all the time when he washed
them rags and stuff out there

08:00.247 --> 08:02.981
-by that little pump house.
-He had it screwed
on the side of the...

08:02.983 --> 08:04.349
-The pump house.
-Yeah.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.917
You know, it's...
It's just build out of old
telephone poles and...

08:05.919 --> 08:08.587
He'd just drop 'em in there
and wring 'em out.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.455
-Catch him throwing
'em on the clothesline.
-[digger] yep.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.923
Well, if it's still there,
it'll work.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.725
We could wring
that sugarcane out

08:13.727 --> 08:15.760
and get every bit
of liquid that's in there.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.897
You ain't never been to...
To popcorn's anyway.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.032
It'd be an honor for us
to take you over there.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.901
It'd be an honor to tag
along with you guys.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.536
Yeah, we'd...
We'd like to share
that with you.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.071
I got kinda weak
in the knees right there.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.939
Well, let's...
Let's head over there.
Just follow us.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.975
-I will.
-Just follow us, richard.

08:44.024 --> 08:44.890
[jerry] what's
going on, buddy?

08:44.892 --> 08:46.224

for us, brother.
-Really?

08:58.705 --> 08:59.938
It's beautiful, man.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.840
It is deep in the mountains.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.843
We got plenty of water.
We got everything
that we need.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.978
The thing about it is,
it's in tennessee.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.847
-Are you serious?
-Yep, but--

09:08.849 --> 09:10.749
so what's the lawyer
situation going on?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.951
I hadn't seen
or heard anything.

09:12.953 --> 09:13.818
-Nice.
-[mike] we can set up there

09:13.820 --> 09:14.953
for the duration,
I believe, man.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.488
You know, me and jerry,

09:16.490 --> 09:17.789
we been running
in north carolina
this season.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.724
<i>  I thought we had</i>
<i>  the perfect place,</i>

09:19.726 --> 09:21.860
but the man decided
to sell the property
out from under us.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.961
[jerry] you know,
the doctor's kinda...

09:22.963 --> 09:25.096
He's lifting
my restrictions
a little bit,

09:25.098 --> 09:26.531
as far as I can
get out and walk
and do what I need to do,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.833
but he said still,
no heavy lifting
for a while.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.403
I don't wanna take no chances,
you know, just having
a damn aneurysm.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.071
I understand.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.540
I want you to do
everything you can do
to get healed up and better.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.509
<i>  You know, jerry's</i>
<i>  on doctor's orders</i>
<i>  right now.</i>

09:37.511 --> 09:39.911
He can't do a whole lot.
He can't pick up
on heavy stuff.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.647
So all jerry's
gotta do is load up
and come with me.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.115
We're just gonna have
to have some help, though.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.250
Well, I got a fellow
on the way.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.017
I got jesse coming.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.452
We're gonna
load this stuff up,

09:47.454 --> 09:48.954
we're gonna get it
up there to where
we're going.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.689
-You done one step
ahead of me, friend.
-I am. I'm...

09:50.691 --> 09:52.958
I told you I was gonna beat
the damn ground up, sir.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.160
-Man, I'm super tickled.
-I gotta get it...
I gotta get it going.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.996
Anytime you're moving
your stuff point a to point b,

09:57.998 --> 09:59.664
it's a risky move
to start with,

09:59.666 --> 10:02.467
<i>  let alone having</i>
<i>  to find somebody</i>
<i>  to help you do that</i>

10:02.469 --> 10:04.436
<i>  other than</i>
<i>  your all-the-time partner.</i>

10:04.438 --> 10:07.505
You gotta find that guy
you can trust in to help
you move that stuff.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.775
<i>  I trust jesse.</i>
<i>  He's never turned his back</i>
<i>  on me whatsoever.</i>

10:10.777 --> 10:13.478
-[mike] what do you say,
jesse earl?
-[jesse] not much.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.580
[mike] well look, uh, we'll
make it short and sweet.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.983
You know, you've helped
us out a good bit in the past
and everything,

10:17.985 --> 10:19.818
we're gonna take the back
roads across the mountain.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.652
You know where to go.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.886
Yeah, I know where to go.

10:21.888 --> 10:22.654
-[jesse] I'm ready.
-Let's do it.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.756
[mike] come up
on there, bubba.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.758
<i>  Yeah, we gotta make</i>
<i>  sure when we get</i>
<i>  all this stuff loaded up,</i>

10:26.760 --> 10:28.660
we get it covered up
with a tarp

10:28.662 --> 10:31.396
where nobody'll notice
anything suspicious
or anything like that

10:31.398 --> 10:33.565
and get it back
across the mountain,

10:33.567 --> 10:37.469
<i>  and me and jesse, we know</i>
<i>  the back roads where we don't</i>
<i>  have to hit no interstate</i>

10:37.471 --> 10:39.871
or no main highways at all,
and get it back over there.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.806
So that's the route
we're gonna take.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.709
All we gotta do now
is get across the damn
mountain with it.

10:44.711 --> 10:45.944
Gonna come in there
and supervise first?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.912
-Well, why not?
-Hell, yeah.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.281
<i>  Let's get across there</i>
<i>  in one damn piece.</i>

11:01.795 --> 11:03.828
[richard] oh,
this is the place!

11:03.830 --> 11:06.097
-[digger] yep.
-[ramsey] this is it, richard.
This is...

11:06.099 --> 11:07.999
[digger] this is where
all the history
was really made.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.567
This is where popcorn
made liquor.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.302
I'm standing
where popcorn made liquor.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.841
I'm really, really humbled
that you guys would...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.576
Would even allow
me to stand...

11:18.578 --> 11:19.944
-Well.
-...Where popcorn stood.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.980
[ramsey] he'd be
honored to have you here.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.549
Well, richard's came
and he's brought all
this sugarcane,

11:24.551 --> 11:28.820
<i>  but he didn't bring</i>
<i>  any means of pressing it</i>
<i>  to get the sugar out of it.</i>

11:28.822 --> 11:32.791
<i>  We just made</i>
<i>  the suggestion if a old</i>
<i>  clothes wringer would work,</i>

11:32.793 --> 11:36.628
and, uh, we knew popcorn
had some of 'em at his place.

11:36.630 --> 11:40.398
There's a lot of damn
drinking and shindigging
went on up here.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.801
Now, this is popcorn's
original old house.

11:42.803 --> 11:47.405
It don't look any different
now than it did
20 years ago, really.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.475
[richard] this is where
popcorn opened doors
and spended his nights.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.811
-[digger] it's a little
cleaner than it was.
-[all laughing]

11:52.813 --> 11:56.047
[digger] he didn't get
one of anything, he got
12 of everything.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.149
-[richard] popcorn's
phone book, huh?
-[ramsey] hey, digger.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.951
[digger] hey,
there's your daddy.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.087
-[ramsey] that's still
my daddy's phone number.
-[digger] yep.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.888
-[ramsey] digger
right above it.
-Yeah.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.025
That [bleep] said March, 2001.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.760
Well, I don't have a home
phone anymore, but...

12:08.762 --> 12:12.063
There's a good chance
that there's damn snakes
and rats, so...

12:12.065 --> 12:13.898
We ain't gonna look
real deep in here.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.400
You see that wringer anymore?

12:15.736 --> 12:16.735
[digger] I do not.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.304
Hell, he always washed
them old rags and laundry

12:19.306 --> 12:20.672
over there
at the pump house, digger.

12:20.674 --> 12:23.174
If it ain't in here, I ain't
digging around in that no how.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.111
I'm glad these damn
walls can't talk, richard.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.713
[digger] ooh, if them
walls talk, I'm gonna
call 'em a liar.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.115
[laughs]

12:30.817 --> 12:32.717
[ramsey] here's where
he washed clothes.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.420
[digger] this is where
he kept stuff,
in the old pump house.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.457
You see him, ask him
where that wringer's at.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.159
[richard] oh, damn.
This is it?

12:41.862 --> 12:43.261
You were right!

12:44.731 --> 12:45.997
-Yep.
-Mr. Mark, you were
totally right.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.966
That'll definitely crush cane.

12:47.968 --> 12:48.900
[ramsey] just so you know,

12:48.902 --> 12:52.070
if popcorn was here
and you had a press,

12:52.072 --> 12:54.172
-he'd still do it
this damn way.
-[richard laughs]

12:54.174 --> 12:56.174
-[richard] let's
go mash it in.
-[ramsey] all right.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.509
Here we go.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.110
Now that we've found
this wringer,

12:59.112 --> 13:03.381
it's time to go up on the hill
at their old barn and wring
out some sugarcane.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.222
Cane juicing 101.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.925
-[ramsey] well, it is pretty,
ain't it, richard?
-[richard] yes, it is.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.093
[digger] oh, it's spongy.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.294
Full of juice.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.163
Full of potential alcohol.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.099
Yeah, potential being
the main ingredient.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.500
<i>  The problem with sugarcane</i>

13:22.502 --> 13:24.936
is all that juice
is inside the cane.

13:24.938 --> 13:28.039
<i>  So we've got to flatten</i>
<i>  this out as flat as we can</i>

13:28.041 --> 13:29.874
to press all that juice out.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.743
That's the way
you want it, right there.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.112
[richard] I think
that'll hold us just fine.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.415
Right now, we're gonna
test out our theory.

13:37.417 --> 13:41.219
We're gonna see if this
will do what we need to do.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.321
[digger] yeah, just take it.
Just go straight down
right here.

13:43.824 --> 13:44.889
Look at that!

13:46.059 --> 13:47.959
[ramsey] you'd think they're
dry as powder, but...

13:47.961 --> 13:50.862
Damn, it shot me right
in the... Money shot.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.231
[ramsey] digger's really
figured this out, richard.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.133
[digger] watch it
when you go back up with it.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.802
[richard] oh, it comes
out even more!

13:57.804 --> 14:01.973
Richard brought
these stalks of sugarcane.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.275
<i> There's a half gallon of juice</i>
<i> coming out of each one of 'em.</i>

14:04.277 --> 14:06.244
It's just like a waterfall.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.846
Nature's bounty.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.850
A processed sugar
like we would buy in the store
is a processed sugar.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.985
This is a clean
sugar, unadulterated.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.587
<i>  It's not been tampered</i>
<i>  with by man,</i>

14:15.589 --> 14:17.856
<i>  so this is a much</i>
<i>  purer substance.</i>

14:17.858 --> 14:19.591
This fibrous stuff,
this is where
you're gonna pull

14:19.593 --> 14:22.126
a whole lot of sugar from.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.095
In louisiana,
every part of this was used.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.064
They made
brake pads out of this.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.131
This and the skin at one time.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.901
Even the liquid that was
left over is called bagasse.

14:29.903 --> 14:34.105
They would take that stuff,
and it's putrid, it stinks,
it dries,

14:34.107 --> 14:35.840
-we spread it over...
-[both] use it
for fertilizer.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.776
They weren't throwing
anything away
back in the day.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.912
<i> [digger] well, you know,</i>
<i>  we use sugar</i>
<i>  that's been refined</i>

14:40.914 --> 14:43.715
<i>  out of juice that would come</i>
<i>  out of cane like this.</i>

14:43.717 --> 14:46.851
But, you know,
with this process,
it's not being refined.

14:46.853 --> 14:49.454
It's a totally different
flavor profile.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.689
It might hurt your teeth,
it's so sweet.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.959
[richard] well,
doing a little research
on this stuff,

14:54.961 --> 14:59.063
I found out
that some people actually
take this for bad breath

14:59.065 --> 15:01.466
and strengthening enamel
on your teeth.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.134
-[digger] hmm.
-Dentists will tell you

15:03.136 --> 15:05.904
that that's something
that can't be done,
but science--

15:05.906 --> 15:07.739
[digger] four out
of five dentists
say you're full of [bleep].

15:07.741 --> 15:09.507
[ramsey chuckles]

15:09.509 --> 15:11.943
[richard] in louisiana,
we've got a lot of wild hogs
running around.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.045
These hogs taste
a whole lot different
that it's been eating

15:14.047 --> 15:15.046
the sugar cane.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.714
These things taste so good.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.450
They shed their tears
their self
while they're alive. [laughs]

15:19.452 --> 15:21.653
-you ever heard
of such a thing?
-[laughing] I have not.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.621
We are what we eat.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.125
-Digger, your new name's
macaroni and cheese.
-[digger laughs]

15:27.127 --> 15:30.728
[digger] I'd send every
elementary school teacher
right to your front porch.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.497
You'd start feeding it
to them in kindergarten.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.933
Their eyes would be that big
right out on the stem,

15:34.935 --> 15:37.101
[buzzing] vibrating
like they ate a thread
of sewing machine

15:37.103 --> 15:38.870
and then running.

15:38.872 --> 15:41.005
<i>  Richard,</i>
<i>  he's the sugarcane king,</i>

15:41.007 --> 15:42.907
he knows more about it
than we do.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.809
[ramsey] look at that.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.979
That's pure, untouched sugar.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.047
[ramsey] 35 gallons.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.082
[richard] that's a lot
of liquid gold right there.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.651
Plus all that sugar
that's in them cherries.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.387
It's going to be
something else.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.890
Well, we've got
a 55 gallon drum
nearly full of it.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.926
Cane juice and now,
we're gonna bunch it up
and we're going to haul it off

16:01.928 --> 16:03.728
and get ready
to make mash with it.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.997
[softly] five, 10,
15, 20, 25, 30...

16:05.999 --> 16:08.066
There's 45 gallons
there, richard.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.634
[richard] that's
a lot of sugar.

16:09.636 --> 16:13.204
That's about 125 lbs.
Of sugar worth right there.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.373
-If not more.
-[digger] hell, yes.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.484
[thunder rumbling]

16:29.923 --> 16:33.391
[huck] well, we've got
the liquor,
I've got the pears here.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.694
-About right, ain't it.
-Yeah!

16:36.696 --> 16:40.932
-I'm excited to see how we can
make some pear moonshine.
-Oh, we can do it.

16:40.934 --> 16:45.403
Last time amanda was here,
she brought a pressurized rig
she'd owned and all that.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.439
So, I'm dying
to see this infusion thing
that you've made, huck.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.576
This time, we're gonna try
to scale up a little bit
on our volume.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.745
<i>  See if we can infuse</i>
<i>  a little more liquor quicker</i>

16:53.747 --> 16:55.480
<i>  than the way we was</i>
<i>  doing it before.</i>

16:55.482 --> 16:57.949
Huck thinks we've come up
with something, but we'll see
how it turns out.

16:57.951 --> 17:01.119
-You was using co2, right?
-[amanda] no2.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.488
But co2 would work
just as well
because they use that

17:03.490 --> 17:06.024
for sodas,
and beers, and things.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.959
-[huck] that'll work
right there.
-[amanda] yeah.

17:07.961 --> 17:11.696
The no2 can just give it,
like, a sweeter flavor,
where the co2

17:11.698 --> 17:14.732
would kind of be used
to flavor,
like, saltier things.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.501
How'd you come up with this?

17:16.503 --> 17:19.804
This right here comes
from a steel supply company.

17:19.806 --> 17:23.841
And I found this at a junkyard
somebody just threw
off to the side there.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.109
I was looking for a part.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.911
-[amanda] you're kidding.
-[huck] yeah.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.379
Looks like a bomb to me.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.481
-Yeah, it does, don't it?
-[laughs]

17:30.483 --> 17:34.285
does it say on there
how much, uh, psi
this thing can hold?

17:34.287 --> 17:36.854
-A hundred and thirty. Okay.
-That's enough, ain't it?

17:36.856 --> 17:39.257
[amanda] yeah, that's a lot
of pressure.

17:39.259 --> 17:42.060
[rogers] I don't know nothing
about that.
I'll cut the pears, then.

17:42.062 --> 17:42.894
How about that?

17:42.896 --> 17:45.696
Sounds good.
[chuckles softly]

17:45.698 --> 17:50.968
this apparatus I'm trying
to put together right here,
uh, it'll be 20 times faster

17:50.970 --> 17:52.804
<i>  than the way</i>
<i>  we was doing it before.</i>

17:52.806 --> 17:55.606
<i>  Amanda had</i>
<i>  these little whipped cream</i>
<i>  chargers, you know,</i>

17:55.608 --> 17:57.942
<i> with the little co2 cartridges</i>
<i>  you screw in.</i>

17:57.944 --> 18:01.546
And then you couldn't do
but maybe a couple quarts
at a time.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.915
Then the filter system
she had was...

18:03.917 --> 18:06.918
I mean it worked good,
it cleaned the liquor up,

18:06.920 --> 18:09.153
but it was a long,
drawn out process.

18:09.155 --> 18:13.024
But this'll be
the inlet line for the gas.

18:13.026 --> 18:14.826
You go into here.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.761
And pressurize this chamber.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.996
And then you're just gonna
attach some kind of, like, uh

18:18.998 --> 18:21.032
-like a psi gauge
on this side?
-Yeah.

18:21.034 --> 18:21.933
[amanda] all right.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.868
I believe that's tight enough.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.837
<i>  Initially, I see this chamber</i>
<i>  that he has,</i>

18:25.839 --> 18:27.939
and I can't believe
somebody would
throw this away.

18:27.941 --> 18:28.806
<i>  It seems</i>
<i>  like it's all functional.</i>

18:28.808 --> 18:29.807
That's perfect.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.443
Yeah. Yep, it goes right
above where we need it.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.147
A good ratio
for this size vessel
is three gallons of alcohol,

18:36.149 --> 18:40.017
one gallon of flavor,
and then just
about a gallon's worth of room

18:40.019 --> 18:41.953
for space, so that we can add
the gas into the chamber.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.322
You let me know
when you start laying
the pressure

18:44.324 --> 18:44.722
because I'm gonna
get way back.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.390
[amanda laughs]

18:46.392 --> 18:49.527
<i>  so, the only concerns</i>
<i>  that I have is that he did</i>
<i>  find it from a scrapyard</i>

18:49.529 --> 18:53.998
and we are about to put, like,
about 100 lbs. Of psi
in this tank right now.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.934
So, I think we're all
a little bit nervous
at this point.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.136
[rogers] I'm gonna get back.

18:58.671 --> 18:59.737
[huck] okay.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.806
[amanda] now, you're
making me nervous.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.876
-Shoot.
-[huck] all right, here we go.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.277
[amanda] fingers crossed,
let's see.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.448
Oh, it's working.

19:11.718 --> 19:17.021
Yeah, it's up to 50 psi
right now. Sixty...

19:17.023 --> 19:18.890
You can cut it.
I mean, we're just,
you know, testing it out.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.992
So, it definitely
holds the pressure.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.660
-This is the fun part,
though, right?
-[huck] yeah.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.794
[hissing]

19:23.796 --> 19:26.097
-it works.
-Didn't blow my ark up.

19:26.099 --> 19:29.400
-[amanda laughs]
-that's what they call
hillbilly engineering,

19:29.402 --> 19:30.568
-right there.
-[amanda] yeah.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.603
But with fruit, I think
this will work great.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.372
Once we release
all the pressure
and the carbonation,

19:34.374 --> 19:38.042
we should just be left
with the moonshine,
plus all the pear flavor.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.945
Now that we have everything
hooked up, everything works
pretty flawlessly,

19:40.947 --> 19:42.680
<i>  and on our dry run.</i>

19:42.682 --> 19:45.783
So, I think that this is gonna
be a really smooth,
really good-tasting

19:45.785 --> 19:47.652
pear corn whiskey at the end.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.821
[huck] that peeling
on them pears right there
will lower your cholesterol.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.757
-[amanda] really?
-Sure will.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.760
Yeah, once we get
all these pears cut up,
we'll boil them.

19:55.762 --> 19:58.729
Twenty, 30 minutes. Get them
softened up real good.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.398
<i>  Get all the sugar out</i>
<i>  of them that we can.</i>

20:00.400 --> 20:02.466
But it'd ought to make
a good flavor.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.102
[amanda] so, I've been meaning
to ask you guys.
You guys are cousins, right?

20:05.104 --> 20:07.972
-First cousins.
-[amanda] and you learned
how to moonshine

20:07.974 --> 20:10.675
from, you know, your fathers?

20:10.677 --> 20:14.278
-My uncle.
-Uncles. My uncles
on my dad's side.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.813
So, you guys
just grew up around it.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.816
-That's all you've ever seen
as kids.
-We was born in still, really.

20:18.818 --> 20:22.320
It's really great to be here
to work with guys
like mark and huck

20:22.322 --> 20:26.090
because they have learned
from generations of people
who've been practicing

20:26.092 --> 20:28.526
moonshining and distilling
in the backwoods.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.828
-[rogers] that a burn? Yeah.
That's bold.
-Smells stout.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.932
I feel like
it's really important to learn
this craft and preserve it

20:34.934 --> 20:37.034
because it's been a part
of our history
since the beginning

20:37.036 --> 20:38.336
of our country.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.705
That's a pretty neat setup,
isn't it?

20:40.707 --> 20:43.574
[amanda] I think it's awesome.
It's exactly
like the small one.

20:43.576 --> 20:48.412
And we have a gauge,
so we know we're being safe
with a gauge. [chuckles]

20:48.414 --> 20:50.982
-[huck] you're not gonna watch
the gauge?
-[amanda chuckles softly]

20:50.984 --> 20:53.351
-[rogers] I'm gonna
let you guys do that.
-[huck] here we go.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.020
-You tell me when you think
we need to stop.
-[amanda] okay.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.056
It might go up faster
this time because we have
a lot of stuff in there.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.525
-[huck] here we go.
-[hissing]

21:01.527 --> 21:04.061
I don't think it's gonna
shoot off or anything,
but, just,

21:04.063 --> 21:07.898
let's not stand in front
of that because it'll go
in that direction.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.267
Worst case scenario.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.302
[hissing]

21:12.739 --> 21:13.871
[huck] here we go.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.007
[amanda] I don't think
it's gonna shoot off

21:16.009 --> 21:18.509
but, just, let's not stand
in front of that.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.611
[hissing]

21:20.613 --> 21:22.947
-it has
a safety pressure release.
-It does, don't it.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.482
-[amanda] look at that.
-[all laugh]

21:24.484 --> 21:26.484
-[amanda] it's
a blow off valve.
-[huck] right.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.286
-[mark] I wouldn't
shake it, huck.
-[huck] you got to.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.922
While it's sitting here,
there's all those bubbles
in there

21:31.924 --> 21:34.659
and it's just forcing
the liquor into those pears.

21:34.661 --> 21:39.764
And once we release it again,
it'll pull the flavor out
of the pears into the liquor.

21:39.766 --> 21:43.134
-In that little device there.
-[rogers] I told you
you was a scientist.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.902
-[amanda] want me
to release the pressure?
-[huck] yes, ma'am.

21:44.904 --> 21:48.105
-All right.
-[hissing]

21:50.443 --> 21:52.910
-[rogers chuckles]
-[amanda] let's see
what we've made here.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.981
Once we take the alcohol
out of the chamber,
we strain the pears

21:56.983 --> 21:57.948
<i>  to get all the liquor out.</i>

21:57.950 --> 21:59.684
-Smells like pears.
-[rogers] mmm-hmm

21:59.686 --> 22:01.085
<i> we've made it a little cloudy,</i>

22:01.087 --> 22:03.621
so instead of trying
to run this back
through a filtration system,

22:03.623 --> 22:05.823
<i>  we're gonna use the still</i>
<i>  as our filter this time.</i>

22:05.825 --> 22:09.260
<i>  And we'll redistill it,</i>
<i>  clean it up,</i>
<i>  and we're gonna get</i>

22:09.262 --> 22:10.928
a cleaner, smoother product
in the end.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.397
-[huck] eat ya one of them.
-[amanda] yeah, taste that.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.437
-Whoop.
-[rogers laughs]

22:23.042 --> 22:25.710
tastes a little bit
hot though, eh?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.478
<i>  That infusion really worked.</i>

22:27.480 --> 22:30.081
<i>  It's just about biting</i>
<i> into one of those large pears.</i>

22:30.083 --> 22:32.783
You know, that's how good
a flavor it is.

22:32.785 --> 22:33.851
It's like a pear corn brandy.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.720
<i> [rogers] but we need to try</i>
<i>  to clear it up.</i>

22:35.722 --> 22:38.856
If we can keep
this same flavor,
we'll really have something.

22:38.858 --> 22:42.993
We probably got, what?
Four or five more gallons
of this to infuse now?

22:42.995 --> 22:46.931
After infusing this corn
with the pears,
it tastes awesome.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.599
-[huck] here we go.
-[hissing]

22:48.601 --> 22:50.735
you tell me when to stop.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.904
I feel like we could take this
and sell this to anybody
and they would love it,

22:53.906 --> 22:55.206
<i>  but because we have</i>
<i>  the time now,</i>

22:55.208 --> 22:57.641
we can take this back
to the still and redistill it
and bring

22:57.643 --> 23:00.144
this pear corn whiskey
to a whole other level.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.213
Well, I guess it's back
to still side, isn't it?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.115
-Yeah.
-Think so.

23:04.117 --> 23:06.684
Load her up. Head that way.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.185
[rogers grunts]

23:18.998 --> 23:22.466
well, I tell you what, man.
You're gonna love
this damn place, brother.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.301
-I hope so.
-It's awesome.

23:24.303 --> 23:27.071
<i>  We're back in tennessee now</i>
<i>  to show jerry</i>
<i>  our new still site.</i>

23:27.073 --> 23:29.607
<i>  But just getting the stuff</i>
<i>  back across the mountain</i>
<i>  is one thing.</i>

23:29.609 --> 23:32.843
<i>  But getting it all the way up</i>
<i>  into the woods to where</i>
<i>  I found the still site.</i>

23:32.845 --> 23:35.613
We're just gonna have
to haul it in there
a couple pieces at a time

23:35.615 --> 23:37.815
<i>  until we get it all in there</i>
<i>  and set up.</i>

23:37.817 --> 23:40.084
I'll tell you what.
This is a pretty little trail
up through here.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.352
Yeah, it is.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.055
Park it right here.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.091
What do you think, bro?

23:48.161 --> 23:49.960
[jerry] son, I'm digging this.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.029
With a big, old, fat shovel.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.432
Why don't you look
at that water, brother.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.600
[mike] reckon we've got plenty
of it, did I not tell you?

23:56.602 --> 23:59.370
-[jerry] I don't think
it'll ever dry up on us.
-[mike] no, sir.

24:01.507 --> 24:02.873
-Is that not good?
-I was about to say
well that's

24:02.875 --> 24:06.444
some damn good water
right there
and cold, god!

24:06.446 --> 24:08.512
You can tell this place
has never been logged
or anything.

24:08.514 --> 24:12.149
The trees are just gigantic.
This waterfall's enormous.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.985
<i>  I think mike got us</i>
<i>  a really good site</i>
<i>  for the rest of the season.</i>

24:14.987 --> 24:17.621
Luckily, this right here
is about the only flat spot
we got.

24:17.623 --> 24:18.956
Right in this little area,
right here.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.826
[mike] with the setup we got,
it don't take much.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.161
[jerry] no, this little setup
we ain't got much at all.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.063
Run it here. Barrel to barrel.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.866
Set our mash barrels
right up against
that log right there.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.000
Keep it all nice and tight.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.269
That's right.
We'd kill
all this little stuff.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.872
That'd kind of open it up
right in here a little.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.975
I'm excited being back here
in east tennessee.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.577
<i>  Me and jerry, we've had</i>
<i>  our ups and downs.</i>

24:39.579 --> 24:42.780
But all our stuff's here
that we can work with.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.915
And I'm ready to hit
the ground running,
get me set up.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.917
Mike, I got this part.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.019
-I feel like I done
my part today.
-Yeah, you did.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.788
It's all right.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.424
You know, I got pretty strict
doctor's orders. I'm not gonna
overdo myself.

24:53.426 --> 24:56.861
My life is more valuable
than any still sites.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.662
We're in here now,
we'll get this little place
cleaned out.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.298
We'll get set up.
Gotta pop in water.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.801
It's only one damn step
at a time.
We can only do so much.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.836
My work for the day's done.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.905
I'm getting out
of this damn hollow
for a little while.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.206
-That'll work.
-Let's do it.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.642
<i> [mike] so, you owe me</i>
<i>  a steak dinner now,</i>
<i>  right, jerry?</i>

25:11.644 --> 25:14.111
<i> -[jerry] you got it.</i>
<i> -[mike laughs]</i>

25:16.015 --> 25:17.815
-[crackling leaves]
-[footsteps approaching]

25:17.817 --> 25:18.949
[gurgling water]

25:22.788 --> 25:24.255
<i> [digger] I know one thing.</i>

25:24.690 --> 25:27.791
It don't take long
to eat up them 40 or 50
dollars' worth of cherries.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.895
[richard] oh, no, I think
I ate about 30 yesterday.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.565
[digger] welcome
to our old still site,
richard.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.734
-Tried and true. We love it.
-[richard] man.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.602
Looks like home.
I'd have a hammock
up here

25:38.604 --> 25:40.871
and a little tent set up.
I wouldn't go nowhere.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.907
Well, you don't know
that the moonshiners
don't ever sit down.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.675
They sleep standing up.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.944
Normally, you don't walk
a stranger
into your still site.

25:46.946 --> 25:50.047
<i>  They're breaking</i>
<i>  rule number one for me.</i>

25:50.049 --> 25:51.715
<i> -[digger] that's big sloppy.</i>
<i> -[ramsey] and the baby.</i>

25:51.717 --> 25:53.951
<i> [digger] we're getting ready</i>
<i>  to mash all this in.</i>

25:53.953 --> 25:56.053
The sugar cane doesn't need
nothing else except adding
the mash,

25:56.055 --> 25:58.622
<i>  but these cherries are</i>
<i>  a little different story.</i>

25:58.624 --> 26:00.558
We gotta cook them up
or they'll cook apart.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.728
The seeds will come out
and we can eliminate those
from the process.

26:04.730 --> 26:08.566
[ramsey] I guess first thing
we need to do is get
that little still took apart.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.833
We just need the burner,
don't we?

26:09.835 --> 26:12.436
Gotta get us
a little water established.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.707
We got fresh cherries,
cane juice...

26:16.709 --> 26:21.045
[ramsey] we're making us
some hillbilly cajun cognac.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.213
This is definitely better
than what comes out
of the bayou.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.014
I can drink this right now.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.482
[digger] I'm gonna get
some cherries

26:25.484 --> 26:27.351
because I don't know
how much water we need.

26:27.353 --> 26:30.888
It really, really
is a hard job getting the pits
out of cherries.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.923
<i>  We've got a lot of cherries,</i>
<i>  so we're going to have to try</i>
<i>  to find a way</i>

26:32.925 --> 26:35.225
to get these pits
out of here effectively.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.962
We're definitely taking
those stems off of them.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.598
Cherries do so good
with liquor, man, but the work
you've gotta put into it.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.166
Exactly.

26:42.168 --> 26:45.803
-Damn watched pot
don't ever start a boil.
-That's what they told me.

26:45.805 --> 26:46.971
One of them's right here.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.607
[laughs] you might.
I can feel her getting softer.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.875
When you're dealing
with fruits,
it's very important

26:51.877 --> 26:55.980
to make sure you start
to break down the structure
so it can ferment effectively.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.482
-[digger] yeah,
they're getting mushy.
-Dropping the pits in there.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.084
Look, there's
a pit right there.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.086
You know, these cherries
are wonderful.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.922
They're not tart,
they're really sweet,
they're full of juice.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.991
<i>  It makes a beautiful mash.</i>

27:06.993 --> 27:10.461
We're gonna make us
a screen to pour
this damn gravy through.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.363
[digger] we're gonna
screen test it.

27:12.365 --> 27:14.732
That's what that policeman
did to me down there
in nashville that time.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.768
He slammed them brakes
on there, was handcuffing,
then bam!

27:17.770 --> 27:20.804
-I said,
"boy, that was a screen test."
-[richard laughs]

27:20.806 --> 27:22.906
<i> [digger] the screen</i>
<i>  we're gonna build,</i>
<i>  it's simple.</i>

27:22.908 --> 27:25.342
<i>  It's just a square</i>
<i>  made out of two by fours.</i>

27:27.947 --> 27:30.080
<i>  We'll just pack</i>
<i>  some chicken wire</i>

27:30.082 --> 27:32.850
kind of like what you build
to build a fish trap
or a minnow trap.

27:32.852 --> 27:33.817
[ramsey] look at that.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.052
Hell, that looks like
that'll work.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.287
Now we just gotta get it
out of this pot.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.025
<i> [digger] when it comes</i>
<i>  to the stones is,</i>

27:41.027 --> 27:42.860
they used to call
the seed and the fruit,

27:42.862 --> 27:45.663
<i>  not only can</i>
<i>  they produce wood alcohol,</i>
<i>  which is a no-no,</i>

27:45.665 --> 27:48.866
<i>  seeds also can</i>
<i>  contain cyanide.</i>

27:48.868 --> 27:52.903
We eliminate that altogether,
just where that doesn't
have to be a concern.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.705
I know this is the pits,
doing this stuff.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.408
-You're a clever man,
richard landry.
-[chuckles]

27:57.410 --> 27:59.543
<i> [richard] so, the pits</i>
<i>  will stay at the top</i>
<i>  of this screen</i>

27:59.545 --> 28:03.714
and we'll have all our flesh
and our cherry juice
in the bucket.

28:03.716 --> 28:06.684
[digger] I'm gonna nut-bust,
and any of you can scrape,
how's that?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.552
[richard] they're still hot
<i>  in there.</i>

28:08.554 --> 28:09.920
<i>  We have these cherries</i>
<i>  heated up.</i>

28:09.922 --> 28:11.655
<i>  We brought 'em</i>
<i>  to a temperature would help</i>

28:11.657 --> 28:12.723
break down a little bit more

28:12.725 --> 28:13.991
what we need broken down
from this.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.592
<i>  Start doing</i>
<i>  a real good ferment.</i>

28:15.594 --> 28:17.127
<i>  We're gonna throw</i>
<i>  our sugar cane in there,</i>

28:17.129 --> 28:19.463
let it cool down,
and we'll pitch some yeast.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.999
That's sugar cane juice,
right there.

28:22.001 --> 28:27.071
If each of these buckets
was equivalent
to 50 pounds of sugar,

28:27.106 --> 28:28.672
<i>  then we've got plenty.</i>

28:28.674 --> 28:30.174
The more sugar,
the more alcohol.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.709
Boys, we're running out
of daylight.

28:31.711 --> 28:32.776
-We gotta pitch this yeast.
-Pitch it.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.045
-This temperature's
good, I mean...
-Mmm-hmm.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.215
We don't need a bunch of it.
Just about a good cupful
in there.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.116
Scattered on top.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.884
All we got to do
is top that off.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.686
Let it do its magic.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.755
We're gonna let you
cap that rascal off,
there, richard.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.990
Oh, man. Y'all gonna let me
cap off this pot?

28:46.992 --> 28:49.893
Line it up with that.
I'm gonna put it
in this thump arm.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.563
That way, we don't get
no unwanted critters.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.765
There's a lot of people think
that they're moonshiners,

28:54.767 --> 28:56.934
and they ain't got a still
as big as that cap.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.636
[digger] till you unload
two truckloads
of sugar a week,

28:59.638 --> 29:01.939
you ain't no moonshiner.

29:08.647 --> 29:11.048
<i> [amanda] you guys ready</i>
<i>  to redistill these pears?</i>

29:11.050 --> 29:13.183
[huck] ready as we'll ever be,
I guess.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.252
[amanda] back at
the old still site

29:15.488 --> 29:16.320
it's a miracle.

29:16.689 --> 29:17.788
[amanda] it's a miracle.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.757
Well, today we made it
back to the still site

29:19.759 --> 29:21.024
with these two buckets
of infused liquor.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.559
<i>  It's a little bit dingy.</i>

29:22.561 --> 29:24.228
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  it ain't real, real clear?</i>

29:24.230 --> 29:26.497
So that's the reason
we want to double-distill it.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.699
<i>  And hopefully,</i>
<i>  it's gonna be pure.</i>

29:28.701 --> 29:29.767
<i>  There ain't gonna be</i>
<i>  no sediment in it.</i>

29:29.769 --> 29:31.502
But right now,
it's just a gamble.

29:31.504 --> 29:34.071
So, just gonna have to see
how that turns out.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.940
You know what?
We're gonna let you
run that yourself.

29:36.942 --> 29:37.541
[amanda] really?

29:37.543 --> 29:39.243
Mmm-hmm. We are.

29:39.245 --> 29:41.645
We just want to sit back.
We want to monitor you.

29:41.647 --> 29:42.780
Watch you.

29:42.782 --> 29:43.614
[amanda] all right.
That's good practice.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.082
I think I can handle it.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.750
I think it'll be definitely
easier to fill
the still today.

29:46.752 --> 29:49.153
Lot less going in there.
[chuckles]

29:49.155 --> 29:51.054
<i>  the guys just told me</i>
<i>  that it's gonna be my job</i>
<i>  to run it</i>

29:51.056 --> 29:52.990
all by myself this time.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.626
So, I'm pretty honored,
because I want them

29:55.628 --> 29:59.263
to trust me and respect me,
and know
that I am also a moonshiner,

29:59.265 --> 30:01.131
<i>  and I can also</i>
<i>  pull my weight here.</i>

30:01.300 --> 30:02.933
Mmm. God!

30:02.935 --> 30:05.869
When we run this,
that'll tell the tale,
right there.

30:05.871 --> 30:07.171
All right.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.706
There's a ton of pressure.
And it's gonna be my chance

30:09.708 --> 30:11.375
to show them what I can do.

30:13.746 --> 30:14.778
[rogers] here you go, amanda.
Here you...

30:14.780 --> 30:16.947
-A little starting fluid here.
-[amanda] all right.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.149
Just be real careful,
I'll tell you. Don't spill it.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.818
Yes, sir.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.186
Step number one, be careful.

30:22.888 --> 30:24.021
[flicks lighter]

30:26.025 --> 30:28.592
<i>  so, cooking on an open fire</i>
<i>  through furnace heat?</i>

30:28.594 --> 30:30.127
<i>  Not a lot of people</i>
<i>  do that anymore.</i>

30:30.129 --> 30:32.896
And if I just get that flame
a little bit too hot,

30:32.898 --> 30:34.832
<i>  we could scorch</i>
<i>  the liquor, possibly, and...</i>

30:34.834 --> 30:37.467
<i>  And then the whole run</i>
<i> would be shot because of that.</i>

30:37.469 --> 30:40.838
So I gotta really make sure
that I pay attention
and watch those coals.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.840
<i> [mark] how's it coming</i>
<i>  over there?</i>

30:42.842 --> 30:43.807
-About ready.
-[mark] pretty close?

30:43.809 --> 30:46.510
Yeah. Steam's up
in this arm, here.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.879
<i> [huck] I'm a little bit</i>
<i>  nervous about rerunning it.</i>

30:48.881 --> 30:50.280
Might lose a little bit
of the flavor.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.481
Don't know yet.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.951
So what do you guys think
about the infusion, so far?

30:53.953 --> 30:55.419
It sure flavored it,
I'll tell you that.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.054
[amanda] yeah.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.789
I guess this right here
is gonna tell the tale though,
ain't it?

30:58.791 --> 30:59.723
It should.

30:59.725 --> 31:00.891
Normally, you'd probably
let it sit

31:00.893 --> 31:03.827
for six to eight weeks,
to get a smooth flavor.

31:03.829 --> 31:06.463
So, we're able
to squeeze it into 20 minutes.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.265
So it's pretty interesting
to see.

31:09.802 --> 31:12.035
Oops. She's running, guys.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.208
[huck] how does it smell?

31:18.944 --> 31:20.077
[amanda] it smells like pears.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.012
<i>  I feel like I'm getting</i>
<i> pretty nervous at this moment,</i>

31:22.014 --> 31:24.481
<i>  because I really want</i>
<i>  mark and huck to approve</i>

31:24.483 --> 31:25.916
<i>  of all the work</i>
<i>  that we've done.</i>

31:25.918 --> 31:27.484
So, now's the moment of truth.

31:30.923 --> 31:31.955
I can't believe this.

31:31.957 --> 31:33.857
[amanda] what do you think?

31:33.859 --> 31:35.492
That's just like
biting into a pear.

31:35.961 --> 31:36.960
[slurps]

31:37.096 --> 31:38.829
-that's some
good stuff, right there.
-It is.

31:38.831 --> 31:39.763
-That's good.
-[amanda] yeah?

31:39.765 --> 31:40.631
[rogers] yeah, move.

31:40.633 --> 31:44.701
Good pear taste.
Clear as a bell.
Happy.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.670
[rogers] y'all, I want
to get me a good
drink of this.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.472
-Clear as a bell, isn't it?
-Yeah.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.773
I'm really happy
with the final product.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.875
<i>  It tastes just like</i>
<i>  lora's pears.</i>

31:51.877 --> 31:53.844
<i>  So, we didn't overwhelm</i>
<i>  the base spirit,</i>

31:53.846 --> 31:56.413
and we were really able
to infuse it
with a ton of flavor.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.681
I'm getting warm.

31:57.683 --> 32:00.250
-All the way down
through my esophagus.
-[huck] mmm-hmm.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.952
-[rogers] is that what
you call it?
-[huck] esophagus.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.320
-[rogers] esophagus?
-[huck] esophagus

32:03.322 --> 32:05.155
fingers starting
to tingle a little.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.291
[claps]

32:15.634 --> 32:19.069
what I thought we would do
is something like this
right here.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.738
Then fill it up
with that infused liquor.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.807
When that's on a shelf
at a bar,

32:23.809 --> 32:26.610
people will pick that
out of 100 bottles,
and say they want to try it.

32:26.612 --> 32:27.811
-They will. Yeah.
-'cause it looks pretty.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.913
Yeah, you put this pear
down that jar of liquor,

32:29.915 --> 32:33.016
<i>  and set it up on the shelf</i>
<i>  for a week or two,</i>

32:33.018 --> 32:35.319
that pear right there
will be pretty potent.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.956
Yeah, we're gonna
split this up three ways.

32:39.658 --> 32:40.557
Oh, yeah?

32:40.859 --> 32:41.758
I get to take a little bit
of this home?

32:41.760 --> 32:44.761
-[huck] yes, ma'am.
-That's awesome.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.731
[huck] I guess we better wrap
this up and get outta here,
hadn't we?

32:47.733 --> 32:49.733
<i>  Amanda, you know,</i>
<i>  we kind of learned her</i>
<i>  how to do, uh,</i>

32:49.735 --> 32:51.802
liquor in the old-timey way.

32:51.804 --> 32:54.738
<i>  And she taught us something,</i>
<i>  on this infusion, you know?</i>

32:54.740 --> 32:55.973
<i>  A quicker way to do it.</i>

32:55.975 --> 32:58.342
I think she's happy
with what we taught her,

32:58.344 --> 33:00.811
and we're happy
with what she taught us.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.914
You come up with any more
of these brilliant ideas
on this liquor, let us know.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.116
<i>  We'll try something else.</i>

33:18.063 --> 33:21.798
We gotta figure on how
we're gonna set everything up,
don't we?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.433
We've got the best still site
in the world right now.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.069
<i>  We have this massive</i>
<i>  water supply.</i>

33:26.071 --> 33:29.272
Now, all we've got to do
is get everything set up,
and we're ready to go.

33:29.274 --> 33:30.340
-There it is.
-There it is.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.408
Lookee there!

33:32.044 --> 33:32.642
Pretty good, ain't it?

33:32.644 --> 33:34.344
That's the last bit.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.850
<i> [mike] I'm ready to see</i>
<i>  some damn monkeys</i>
<i>  fly outta that pot, baby!</i>

33:39.852 --> 33:41.618
Just gotta get some water
fed over here,

33:41.620 --> 33:42.919
<i>  and we're just gonna</i>
<i>  keep it simple.</i>

33:42.921 --> 33:44.654
We're gonna get us
a couple pieces
of 4-inch pipe,

33:44.656 --> 33:47.124
<i>  lay it up</i>
<i>  against this water bottle,</i>

33:47.126 --> 33:50.327
and just hook a water hose
to it and let mother nature
do the work.

33:51.697 --> 33:52.362
[screams]

33:52.364 --> 33:54.097
hey! You son of a bitch, you!

33:54.099 --> 33:55.298
[giggles]

33:55.300 --> 33:57.000
you scream in that damn pipe!

33:57.002 --> 33:58.068
[laughing] yeah.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.036
[mike] oh, my god!

33:59.038 --> 33:59.903
[jerry chuckles]

33:59.905 --> 34:01.705
[mike] you scared me
to damn death, bull.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.106
[jerry] go to your right.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.508
We're gonna send it up
to your right, right there.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.110
I tell you what, you know,
it may not seem like it

34:07.112 --> 34:10.213
standing down and looking up,
but when you're up there
looking back down,

34:10.215 --> 34:12.082
that's a long way to fall.

34:14.119 --> 34:15.585
Ugh! [bleep]

34:15.587 --> 34:16.119
[jerry] hey!

34:16.121 --> 34:17.788
Don't you slip and fall!

34:17.790 --> 34:19.823
These stinking weeds
is killing me!

34:19.825 --> 34:22.192
<i>  A lot of people say</i>
<i> it wouldn't be worth the risk.</i>

34:22.194 --> 34:25.362
This is our livelihood.
This is what me and jerry
does for a living.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.930
It's gotta be done.

34:26.932 --> 34:31.268
Jerry! Let me pull it this way
a little bit and tie it off
over here.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.436
[jerry] okay, well,
pull it up!

34:33.839 --> 34:34.371
[grunts]

34:36.575 --> 34:37.774
that's good!

34:37.776 --> 34:39.976
<i> [mike] getting my pipe</i>
<i>  exactly where I need it.</i>

34:39.978 --> 34:42.813
Got her tied off,
and we're in good shape
to go, now.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.848
Yee-haw! Come on down!

34:44.850 --> 34:45.415
[mike] all right.

34:46.852 --> 34:48.051
Hey, hey!

34:48.187 --> 34:49.286
Whoa! [bleep]

34:49.955 --> 34:50.821
-whoo!
-Careful!

34:50.823 --> 34:52.255
Damn! What do we got, jerry?

34:52.257 --> 34:53.457
We got some good water.

34:53.459 --> 34:54.925
You want to see something
really cool?

34:54.927 --> 34:55.826
What's that?

34:55.828 --> 34:56.393
Watch this.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.496
Whoo-hoo!

34:59.498 --> 35:00.797
We got all kinds of water.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.299
By god, I think we do,
don't we?

35:02.301 --> 35:04.468
It's flowing out
like a fire hose.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.170
<i>  You could beat the paint</i>
<i>  off the side of a house</i>
<i>  with this stuff.</i>

35:07.806 --> 35:08.772
Son, we got water.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.340
That ought to cool it,
shouldn't it, though?

35:10.342 --> 35:11.575
Ought to keep her
good and cold.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.909
Oh, yeah.

35:12.911 --> 35:15.011
Now the big question is,
what the hell
we gonna mash in?

35:15.614 --> 35:16.880
We'll come up with something.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.615
We're gonna have to figure it
out pretty quickly.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.951
Gonna have to get
mashed in
in the next few days.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.353
We're at that point,
and we're ready.
Right? That's a start.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.021
We got the wheels a-turning.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.591
We got the site for it, now.
We got good, clean,
fresh water.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.159
Good damn job today.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.727
It felt pretty good today,
to get here and work.

35:30.729 --> 35:33.230
Yeah! I'm tickled with it!

35:33.232 --> 35:35.398
<i> [jerry] I don't know</i>
<i>  about you, but I'm ready</i>
<i>  for a burger.</i>

35:45.677 --> 35:49.279
<i> [ramsey] you know,</i>
<i>  I don't know if this cherry</i>
<i>  will be cognac, technically.</i>

35:49.281 --> 35:51.481
<i> [richard] well, we'll make it</i>
<i>  believe it's cognac.</i>

35:51.483 --> 35:53.783
<i> [digger] we'll tell it</i>
<i>  long enough, it'll believe</i>
<i>  anything we tell it.</i>

35:53.785 --> 35:55.185
<i> [richard] back in paradise.</i>

35:55.187 --> 35:59.156
The day has come.
It's time to run
hillbilly cajun cognac.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.091
[richard] lookee, there.

36:02.895 --> 36:04.494
Oh, hell.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.563
It's better than last year's
calendar, ain't it?

36:06.565 --> 36:09.266
Mash is wonderful.
It's got plenty of flavor.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.935
Got plenty of alcohol
in there.
It's bitter as acid.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.870
Hot dog!

36:13.872 --> 36:15.071
-Smells pretty good.
-Hmm.

36:15.073 --> 36:18.275
Let's make some damn
hillbilly cajun cognac
right quick.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.610
Yeah, let's get busy
of getting her preheated.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.112
If we can get
some of these flavors

36:22.114 --> 36:24.447
to come through
in this end run,
we're in business.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.483
[ramsey] I want you
to do the honor
of lighting this thing.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.618
Get over here on this side,
'cause I don't want
you turning

36:28.620 --> 36:31.821
-that damn condenser on.
-[digger] keep your head
kind of out of the way.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.891
Unless you like looking
at flames right before
they set your eyes on fire.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.493
You ready?

36:36.495 --> 36:38.361
[digger] well, no,
but the question is,
are you ready?

36:38.797 --> 36:40.230
Whoa!

36:45.671 --> 36:48.071
[ramsey] right here
is where the old man's at,
richard.

36:48.073 --> 36:50.874
[digger] yep.
Don't look like he's dug out,
yet.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.976
I wouldn't put it
past him, though.

36:52.978 --> 36:53.777
[richard] he try
to get out of there?

36:53.779 --> 36:55.512
-[ramsey] oh, yeah.
-[digger] yeah.

36:55.514 --> 36:58.048
He ain't never been one
for conforming to the rules.
You ought to know that.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.917
[richard] never thought
I would see this
in my lifetime.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.653
Yeah, he's a... He's there.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.723
[ramsey] he's actually buried
about eight or nine feet deep.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.893
[digger] it's as deep
as the backhoe would
comfortably reach.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.128
[mark] hell, we wouldn't want
to give him a chance
to claw out.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.763
-[richard chuckles]
-[digger] yep.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.899
Old man, I want you
to meet richard.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.968
Richard, meet popcorn.

37:17.970 --> 37:20.971
You can speak, but if he does,
I'm outta here.

37:20.973 --> 37:22.973
-[ramsey and richard chuckle]
-it's a pleasure, popcorn.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.474
[all chuckling]

37:25.877 --> 37:26.943
<i> [richard] you ready?</i>

37:28.247 --> 37:29.980
[all] whoa!

37:29.982 --> 37:31.147
[richard] that got me.

37:31.149 --> 37:31.681
[mark] I smell hair.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.316
Yeah, you do.

37:35.754 --> 37:39.889
Hillbilly biscuits. Rye paste.
It'll get hard
as superman's kneecap.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.592
Popcorn always said
he made enough paste

37:42.594 --> 37:44.027
to make every man,
woman, and child

37:44.029 --> 37:46.496
in maggie valley,
north carolina a biscuit.

37:46.498 --> 37:47.998
But you know,
I never did see that,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.133
'cause he was always
making me or jb make it.

37:50.135 --> 37:51.334
[all chuckling]

37:51.336 --> 37:53.903
[ramsey] well, it's sticky
on your fingers, ain't it?

37:53.905 --> 37:56.573
[digger] when you're out here
in these mountains,
you get hot and sweaty.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.475
And then you don't feel
quite so fresh?

37:58.477 --> 38:00.844
Well, you don't have to carry
none of that damn, uh...

38:00.846 --> 38:02.245
Summer's eve with you,
or anything.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.914
You just put one
of your wet rags up here.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.816
Wipe your head off,
wipe your arms off.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.151
[laughs]

38:09.955 --> 38:11.921
boys, we'll have liquor
just about any minute.

38:11.923 --> 38:12.789
[richard] a big stream.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.890
Of what?

38:13.892 --> 38:15.625
Hillbilly cajun cognac.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.127
-There you go.
-[ramsey] thank you.

38:17.129 --> 38:20.363
Man, this is richard's liquor.
This is his whole damn idea,
so...

38:20.365 --> 38:21.665
Yeah, we're just doing this
for you.

38:21.667 --> 38:25.902
You know, really,
to be true cognac,
it's gotta be barrel-aged.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.139
You got some way
of aging this up
when you get it home?

38:29.141 --> 38:30.340
I'll figure it out.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.375
[digger] lookee there.

38:32.377 --> 38:35.078
There's a little
up in there already.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.548
You know, sears,
all them old catalog companies
back in the day?

38:38.550 --> 38:40.650
They sold these things
as washtubs.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.720
But they made 'em
out of copper instead of steel

38:43.722 --> 38:46.022
because people wanted to make
liquor stills out of 'em.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.991
They'd solder that cap on 'em,

38:47.993 --> 38:50.160
put 'em a little worm
coming off of it,

38:50.162 --> 38:51.895
they'd run 'em
a little liquor.

38:51.897 --> 38:52.896
-[richard] make a still.
-Yeah.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.497
[mark] I can't get over
how good it smells, boys.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.032
[digger] oh, it's got
a hell of a nose on it.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.468
It smells like a big
cherry pie coming out
of the oven, don't it?

38:58.470 --> 39:00.437
Damn, it's too hot to drink,
ain't it?

39:01.740 --> 39:04.174
We do a strip and run
out of the mash,

39:04.176 --> 39:05.942
get the alcohol out,
and we get enough to fill

39:05.944 --> 39:08.111
this other little still up
pretty well full.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.312
This son of a bitch is heavy!

39:09.314 --> 39:11.648
-[richard] in the scoop.
-[ramsey] oh, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:11.650 --> 39:12.949
-God, the money!
-We're spilling
some good liquor.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.118
Slow, slow, richard.
Slow, slow.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.821
I wanna get this thing
completely sealed up

39:17.823 --> 39:19.989
before we put
any fire around it.

39:19.991 --> 39:23.093
There ain't nothing
like the smell
of scorched skin

39:23.095 --> 39:25.028
-from high-proof alcohol.
-[richard chuckles]

39:25.030 --> 39:26.629
this is what makes
cognac cognac.

39:26.631 --> 39:27.897
Second distillation.

39:27.899 --> 39:31.668
You know, we're probably gonna
end up with 25% less volume.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.204
But it'll up the proof
something fierce.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.805
[digger] gotta get
over behind the other still.

39:35.807 --> 39:36.940
[richard chuckles]

39:36.942 --> 39:39.342
is this one gonna be as bad
as that one was?

39:41.046 --> 39:42.178
I think we'll get
a pretty good run

39:42.180 --> 39:45.482
<i>  out of this spirit run</i>
<i>  over here in the smaller pot.</i>

39:45.484 --> 39:47.717
Should bring us
plenty of liquor
and plenty of flavor in it.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.753
[richard]
<i>  this is our spirit run.</i>

39:49.755 --> 39:53.022
<i>  This is where</i>
<i>  we're gonna get our flavor,</i>
<i>  and everything else from.</i>

39:53.024 --> 39:54.758
<i> [digger] it's gonna</i>
<i>  get hot quick.</i>

39:54.760 --> 39:55.825
-It's hot right now.
-[ramsey chuckles]

39:55.827 --> 39:58.094
[digger] and that'd be
pot holder.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.530
-[richard and mark] whoa!
-Yeah, what's wrong with you?

40:00.532 --> 40:02.031
Well, it's coming.
Ooh, it's already--

40:02.033 --> 40:04.834
-I'm telling you. Look.
-[ramsey] you're a damn
glutton for punishment.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.469
That's how you make one
start quick.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.937
[richard] that's how
you do it.

40:08.673 --> 40:11.841
[ramsey] now there's what
damn dreams is made of, buddy.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.309
[digger] fill us a jar
outta there, hattie.

40:13.812 --> 40:14.844
Let's see where we're at.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.914
It ought to be
really good liquor
right about now.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.016
There you go.
I caught you a little bit.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.985
Lookee here.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.453
-[ramsey] isn't this pretty?
-[digger] mmm!

40:25.857 --> 40:27.223
Man, that smells good.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.625
[smacks lips]

40:28.860 --> 40:30.960
-[digger] tastes awful good,
too.
-My god, it is good.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.128
[mouthing] oh, wow.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.297
Fiery.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.665
This tastes awesome.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.468
<i>  There's a perfect balance</i>
<i>  right here,</i>
<i>  with these cherries.</i>

40:38.470 --> 40:43.006
You can appreciate the fact
that cherry is in it
without it being overpowering.

40:43.008 --> 40:43.840
We just made
a real good drink.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.643
Last one.

40:46.645 --> 40:50.213
You said you'd be happy
if we could fill
this barrel up, then...

40:50.215 --> 40:52.015
-Man, I'm happy.
-We should be happy.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.983
I'm happy happy.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.554
I'm gonna take this barrel
back home,

40:57.556 --> 40:59.155
find a barrel to put it in,

40:59.157 --> 41:02.959
figure out a way to rapid-age
this on the bayou,
and sell it.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.427
[ramsey] damn liquor's heavy.

41:04.429 --> 41:06.963
It was much lighter
coming in here,

41:06.965 --> 41:09.766
-when it was just cherries
and sugarcane juice.
-[digger] you ain't [bleep].

41:09.768 --> 41:12.702
Really and truly,
it's all about
all the camaraderie here,

41:12.704 --> 41:15.238
and combining so many
different worlds,

41:15.240 --> 41:17.607
<i>  and gaining more knowledge</i>
<i>  from each other.</i>

41:17.609 --> 41:19.943
But, if you don't make
good liquor,
it's all for naught.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.811
[ramsey] all it needs
is a barrel.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.247
[richard] yeah, we're gonna
bayou-age this.

41:24.249 --> 41:27.183
[ramsey] I got all the faith
in the world in you,
my friend.
