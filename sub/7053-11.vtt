00:14.042 --> 00:15.442
Through this holy anointing,

00:15.510 --> 00:17.878
may the lord and his love and mercy

00:17.946 --> 00:26.787
help you with the grace
of the holy spirit.

00:26.855 --> 00:29.723
May the lord who frees
you from sin save you

00:29.791 --> 00:33.527
and in his goodness raise you up.

00:40.702 --> 00:42.136
Are you ready?

01:07.695 --> 01:10.497
Time of death, 5:21 a.m.

01:13.468 --> 01:16.470
We have a team assembled and waiting.

01:16.538 --> 01:18.405
Ms. Donovan, I'm afraid we need

01:18.473 --> 01:20.607
to begin the procedures right away.

01:27.082 --> 01:29.583
I love you.

01:37.959 --> 01:39.960
We gotta hurry up. Core temp's dropped.

01:40.028 --> 01:41.095
Where's the list?

01:41.162 --> 01:42.529
Yep.

01:42.597 --> 01:44.731
- Watch your back, sir.
- Get her to harvest.

01:46.501 --> 01:50.070
We'll be able to coordinate
that with the transplant team.

01:50.138 --> 01:51.205
Great. Do we have a time frame?

01:51.272 --> 01:53.574
Not yet.

01:53.641 --> 01:56.410
Lean it over.

02:00.048 --> 02:02.149
I'm gonna begin with the kidneys.

02:02.217 --> 02:04.818
The heart and lung block
are gonna come last.

02:04.886 --> 02:06.787
Clamping off the renal artery now.

02:06.855 --> 02:08.020
Yes, doctor.

02:12.961 --> 02:14.461
All right, I've got the first one.

02:14.529 --> 02:16.830
Oh, God, she's alive!

02:16.898 --> 02:18.632
Get a trauma team in here.

02:49.497 --> 02:50.998
The girl's name is Lisa Donovan.

02:51.065 --> 02:52.599
She's a high school junior.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.735
She collapsed during gym class last week

02:54.802 --> 02:55.969
and slipped into a coma.

02:56.037 --> 02:57.638
Doctors diagnosed a cerebral aneurysm.

02:57.705 --> 02:59.640
After she was determined brain-dead,

02:59.707 --> 03:02.009
her mother made the decision
to take her off life support.

03:02.076 --> 03:03.477
And then she woke up from the dead

03:03.545 --> 03:05.145
screaming random numbers.

03:05.213 --> 03:07.414
This is Lieutenant Commander
Turlough, United States Navy.

03:07.482 --> 03:10.784
He's here because it turns out
those numbers weren't random.

03:10.852 --> 03:12.619
They're an alphanumeric code.

03:12.687 --> 03:15.556
The lead surgeon did two
tours on an aircraft carrier.

03:15.623 --> 03:17.424
He recognized one section
as lineal identification

03:17.492 --> 03:18.659
for sailors in the US Navy.

03:18.726 --> 03:19.860
That's when I got the call.

03:19.928 --> 03:21.028
The first half of the sequence

03:21.095 --> 03:23.197
is ID information

03:23.264 --> 03:25.532
for a petty officer named Andrew Rusk.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.167
Second half of the
sequence are launch codes

03:27.235 --> 03:30.137
for icbm missiles aboard
a nuclear submarine

03:30.205 --> 03:32.472
he was stationed on, the USS Gloucester.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.274
How did classified launch codes

03:34.342 --> 03:36.143
get into the hands
of a 17-year-old girl?

03:36.211 --> 03:37.344
Exactly.

03:37.412 --> 03:38.645
That's what I want to ask Rusk.

03:38.713 --> 03:40.080
If he's revealing these codes,

03:40.148 --> 03:41.515
he's committing high treason.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.116
When I tried contacting
him, his wife told me

03:43.184 --> 03:44.484
she reported him missing.

03:44.552 --> 03:46.420
That was three days ago.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.088
Just to ask the obvious, you've
considered the possibility

03:48.156 --> 03:49.990
there's some sort of connection
between Rusk and the girl?

03:50.058 --> 03:51.658
None that we're aware of.

03:51.726 --> 03:52.826
As far as we can tell,

03:52.894 --> 03:54.294
there's never been any contact

03:54.362 --> 03:56.163
between Lisa Donovan and Andrew Rusk.

03:56.231 --> 03:58.365
Well, I suppose that's where we come in.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.234
So how is she?

04:00.301 --> 04:02.703
Scared, as you can imagine.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.272
I'm sorry.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.773
I've never seen him before.

04:06.841 --> 04:12.045
The numbers that you repeated,

04:12.113 --> 04:13.280
do you know what they are,

04:13.348 --> 04:18.051
or do you remember hearing them before?

04:18.119 --> 04:19.620
I don't even remember saying them.

04:19.687 --> 04:21.221
I'm sorry.

04:21.289 --> 04:23.523
Well, at least they got
you some nice balloons.

04:23.591 --> 04:25.459
I guess they couldn't
find ones that said,

04:25.526 --> 04:27.027
"welcome back from the dead."

04:27.095 --> 04:28.762
Yeah.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.031
I imagine those would be more
of a special-order kind of thing,

04:31.099 --> 04:32.599
don't you think?

04:32.667 --> 04:34.434
Lisa, I just have a
couple more questions.

04:34.502 --> 04:37.271
The man's name is Andrew Rusk.

04:37.338 --> 04:40.107
Does that ring any bells?

04:40.174 --> 04:41.708
Maya zvezdochka.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.311
- Shto samnoy?
- Lisa?

04:44.379 --> 04:46.280
Pochimu ya ne magu govorit?

04:46.347 --> 04:48.115
- What's happening?
- She's speaking Russian.

04:48.182 --> 04:49.883
But she doesn't speak Russian.

04:49.951 --> 04:52.286
Maya Zvezdochka.

04:52.353 --> 04:53.320
Lisa?

04:53.388 --> 04:54.921
Lisa, honey, are you okay?

04:54.989 --> 04:56.123
Mom.

04:59.093 --> 05:00.894
- What's happening to me?
- I don't know.

05:00.962 --> 05:02.296
But you're fine now.

05:02.363 --> 05:04.231
No more questions, please.

05:04.299 --> 05:07.334
- She should rest.
- Of course.

05:12.307 --> 05:13.940
Rusk is fluent in Russian.

05:14.008 --> 05:16.710
He would have learned
it during his training.

05:16.778 --> 05:18.779
Any idea what little star is?

05:18.846 --> 05:20.147
Um...

05:20.214 --> 05:23.216
Maya Zvezdochka means
little star in Russian.

05:23.284 --> 05:24.951
I dated a Russian girl for a while.

05:25.019 --> 05:26.820
Most of what I picked up
was curse words, but...

05:26.888 --> 05:30.157
Hey.

05:30.224 --> 05:33.360
Where's Walter?

05:41.736 --> 05:42.936
Walter!

05:43.004 --> 05:45.138
Shh.

05:45.206 --> 05:46.573
I'm trying to listen.

05:46.641 --> 05:48.075
Listening to what?

05:48.142 --> 05:49.476
These people are in comas.
They can't talk to you.

05:49.544 --> 05:51.878
Don't judge him.

05:51.946 --> 05:53.947
He's my son.

05:54.015 --> 05:55.449
And despite his narrow-mindedness,

05:55.516 --> 05:56.450
I'm quite proud.

05:56.517 --> 05:57.884
Do you honestly think

05:57.952 --> 05:59.186
you're communicating with her?

05:59.253 --> 06:00.287
Why shouldn't I be?

06:00.355 --> 06:02.589
No one truly understands

06:02.657 --> 06:04.691
the nature of human
consciousness, Peter.

06:04.759 --> 06:06.493
I've read documented cases

06:06.561 --> 06:08.462
of coma patients waking up and claiming

06:08.529 --> 06:11.365
that they had moved, spirit-like,

06:11.432 --> 06:13.367
to remote locations and witnessed events

06:13.434 --> 06:17.471
they couldn't possibly
have knowledge of.

06:17.538 --> 06:19.339
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

06:19.407 --> 06:21.541
if that's what's happened to
the young lady we just saw.

06:21.609 --> 06:25.278
Yeah, so...

06:25.346 --> 06:26.580
You're saying that you think,

06:26.647 --> 06:28.982
while Lisa Donovan died for a moment,

06:29.050 --> 06:32.586
her... what, her spirit
somehow left her body

06:32.653 --> 06:34.855
and floated over Andrew Rusk
while he was in the process

06:34.922 --> 06:36.690
of telling somebody else
those secret launch codes.

06:36.758 --> 06:41.027
Well, "floated over" is a tad specific,

06:41.095 --> 06:43.597
but...something like that, yes.

06:43.664 --> 06:44.931
It's a theory.

06:44.999 --> 06:46.433
It certainly is.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.911
Hi.

07:00.515 --> 07:05.218
Agent Dunham, I apologize
if I was rude earlier.

07:05.286 --> 07:06.553
How is she?

07:06.621 --> 07:08.221
They don't have any answers,

07:08.289 --> 07:09.856
and now she's running a fever.

07:09.924 --> 07:14.995
They want to run more tests.

07:16.931 --> 07:18.198
We got into a fight

07:18.266 --> 07:21.234
the morning she collapsed.

07:21.302 --> 07:24.304
I wouldn't let her take the car.

07:24.372 --> 07:26.506
All she has is a learner's permit.

07:30.011 --> 07:31.611
And then I got the call from school.

07:31.679 --> 07:33.847
But by the time I got to the hospital,

07:33.915 --> 07:38.318
she was in a coma.

07:38.386 --> 07:42.055
You know, I never
thought that I would...

07:42.123 --> 07:47.060
Get a chance to tell her
how much I loved her again.

07:55.736 --> 07:58.572
God gave her back to me.

08:03.611 --> 08:05.445
You... your daughter's
been through a lot.

08:05.513 --> 08:09.015
And... so have you.

08:12.954 --> 08:15.822
I want permission to have
Dr. Bishop examine her.

08:15.890 --> 08:19.059
What for?

08:19.126 --> 08:21.461
I think he can help her.

08:21.529 --> 08:24.531
I think it might help find Andrew Rusk.

08:26.734 --> 08:30.170
There's nothing more
that she can tell you.

08:46.053 --> 08:47.821
Maya Zvezdochka.

08:52.560 --> 08:53.760
He was here.

08:53.828 --> 08:55.295
That man.

08:55.363 --> 08:57.030
He was here.

08:57.098 --> 08:59.399
Andrew Rusk, the man in the picture.

08:59.467 --> 09:02.235
He was here.

09:02.303 --> 09:04.304
I saw him.

09:07.156 --> 09:09.289
We searched the hospital
for Rusk, got nothing.

09:09.393 --> 09:11.493
And Maureen Donovan won't
let us near her daughter.

09:11.561 --> 09:12.962
She said that our disruptive presence

09:13.029 --> 09:14.897
is what caused Lisa to hallucinate

09:14.965 --> 09:15.998
seeing Rusk's image in the mirror.

09:16.566 --> 09:18.433
How she explain her
kid speaking Russian?

09:18.501 --> 09:21.203
Or knowing icbm launch codes?

09:22.572 --> 09:24.272
Oh, Agent Dunham.

09:24.340 --> 09:25.307
Yes.

09:25.374 --> 09:26.975
I was asked to come in.

09:27.043 --> 09:29.344
I'm Teresa Rusk.

09:29.412 --> 09:32.647
Mrs. Rusk, do you know this girl?

09:32.715 --> 09:34.116
I don't think so.

09:34.183 --> 09:35.283
No.

09:35.351 --> 09:36.451
Why, who is she?

09:36.519 --> 09:37.786
Her name's Lisa Donovan.

09:37.854 --> 09:39.888
She's from brighton.

09:39.956 --> 09:41.356
You think she had something to do with

09:41.424 --> 09:42.524
my husband's disappearance?

09:42.592 --> 09:43.692
We're not sure.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.195
But she has some information

09:47.263 --> 09:48.830
that only your husband should know.

09:48.898 --> 09:50.031
Information?

09:50.099 --> 09:53.235
Classified military codes.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.036
Uh, Mrs. Rusk... Teresa.

09:55.104 --> 09:59.908
Teresa, do the words Maya Zvezda

09:59.976 --> 10:01.042
mean anything to you?

10:01.110 --> 10:03.278
Where did you hear that?

10:03.346 --> 10:04.279
From Lisa Donovan.

10:04.347 --> 10:05.781
Do you know what it means?

10:05.848 --> 10:08.617
"My star."

10:08.684 --> 10:12.521
It's a pet name Andy calls me.

10:12.588 --> 10:14.055
I don't understand.

10:14.123 --> 10:15.390
Who is this girl?

10:15.458 --> 10:17.392
How could she know that?

10:17.460 --> 10:18.460
How?

10:20.296 --> 10:22.097
Lisa Donovan's aneurysm occurred

10:22.165 --> 10:23.398
in her left frontal lobe.

10:23.466 --> 10:26.101
Specifically her broca's area.

10:26.169 --> 10:27.769
That's the part of the brain
that processes language.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.070
Precisely.

10:29.138 --> 10:31.673
But it also has the
capacity for something

10:31.741 --> 10:33.642
far more intriguing.

10:33.709 --> 10:37.145
Hello, I'm Dr. Walter bishop.

10:37.213 --> 10:38.713
This is test subject number six.

10:38.781 --> 10:41.750
What happened to
subjects one through five?

10:41.818 --> 10:44.686
I believe the university
settled with them out of court.

10:44.754 --> 10:46.755
They probably never had to work again.

10:46.823 --> 10:48.190
Not that they could.

10:48.257 --> 10:51.259
I was asked to design an experiment

10:51.327 --> 10:54.429
to test whether cranial manipulation

10:54.497 --> 10:56.932
could increase a person's
psychic capability.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.600
I applied electrical stimuli

10:58.668 --> 11:00.335
to various parts of the brain

11:00.403 --> 11:02.537
and measured each psychic response.

11:02.605 --> 11:04.940
The point is that my tests proved

11:05.007 --> 11:07.175
that manipulation of broca's area

11:07.243 --> 11:10.111
had the most dramatic
effect on a person's ability

11:10.179 --> 11:12.080
to create psychic bonds.

11:12.148 --> 11:14.850
So you think Lisa Donovan's
aneurysm made her psychic.

11:14.917 --> 11:16.384
It's certainly a possibility.

11:16.452 --> 11:17.953
All right, well, let's
say that you're correct.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.788
Why would she be channeling Rusk?

11:19.856 --> 11:20.922
What's so special about him?

11:20.990 --> 11:23.592
That's a good question.

11:23.659 --> 11:26.494
Walter, can you prove
any of what you're saying?

11:26.562 --> 11:27.963
About her being psychic?

11:28.030 --> 11:31.366
Perhaps, if I could examine the girl,

11:31.434 --> 11:33.768
but you say her mother has refused that.

11:33.836 --> 11:36.104
After watching Walter's scariest
home videos, who can blame her?

12:01.664 --> 12:03.565
Hi.

12:03.633 --> 12:04.966
How are you feeling?

12:05.034 --> 12:06.801
I've been really tired,

12:06.869 --> 12:08.303
but good, I guess.

12:08.371 --> 12:10.438
What are you doing here, Agent Dunham?

12:10.506 --> 12:12.440
We think we might have
found an explanation

12:12.508 --> 12:14.109
for what happened to
Lisa in the hospital.

12:14.176 --> 12:15.543
Really?

12:15.611 --> 12:20.282
We believe that Andrew
Rusk may be trying

12:20.349 --> 12:23.385
to communicate through you, psychically.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.054
We're not sure how or why,

12:26.122 --> 12:28.857
but it seems that there's a connection

12:28.925 --> 12:31.893
that's been developed
between him and your daughter.

12:31.961 --> 12:34.462
Lisa, give agent Dunham and me

12:34.530 --> 12:37.899
a minute alone, please.

12:37.967 --> 12:40.969
Lisa, I want to
introduce you to somebody.

12:45.508 --> 12:48.109
Are you a religious woman, agent Dunham?

12:48.177 --> 12:50.478
No. I'm not.

12:50.546 --> 12:52.213
Then I imagine you sit in judgment

12:52.281 --> 12:54.616
of those of us who rely on our faith

12:54.684 --> 12:56.518
to guide our decisions

12:56.585 --> 12:58.286
about what's best for our loved ones.

12:58.354 --> 13:00.555
No.

13:00.623 --> 13:03.258
I know what faith can mean to a person.

13:03.326 --> 13:05.593
But I also believe

13:05.661 --> 13:07.329
that what's happening to Lisa is real,

13:07.396 --> 13:09.364
and if Rusk is a
national security risk...

13:09.432 --> 13:12.400
whatever happened, agent Dunham,

13:12.468 --> 13:14.636
it's over now.

13:14.704 --> 13:17.672
And I believe what's best for Lisa

13:17.740 --> 13:20.775
is that she put all of this behind her.

13:23.512 --> 13:26.147
Here's my card.

13:26.215 --> 13:28.550
If anything else comes up.

13:28.617 --> 13:30.185
Yeah.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.430
The tibetan book of the dead?

13:42.498 --> 13:44.065
Yeah, Walter's been reading up

13:44.133 --> 13:45.066
on psychic connections.

13:45.134 --> 13:47.435
In the Tibetan teachings,

13:47.503 --> 13:51.006
the near-death experiencer
can often converse

13:51.073 --> 13:55.343
with those who have already died.

13:55.411 --> 13:57.612
What do you think?

13:57.680 --> 14:02.217
Well...I think it makes
a hell of a coaster.

14:02.284 --> 14:04.652
What do I think about
what happened to Lisa?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.554
I don't think she's alive

14:06.622 --> 14:08.256
because God changed his mind.

14:11.093 --> 14:13.228
I'm just waiting to see
if lightning strikes you.

14:14.296 --> 14:17.165
Yeah. I... yeah.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.333
I mean, who am I to say?

14:18.401 --> 14:19.734
Maybe there is actually something to it.

14:19.802 --> 14:21.336
People are free to believe
whatever they want, right?

14:21.404 --> 14:23.671
Lisa's mother certainly does.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.874
However, until I see
it with my own eyes,

14:25.941 --> 14:28.743
I'm gonna put my money
on healthy skepticism.

14:35.051 --> 14:37.118
You're obviously a believer.

14:40.623 --> 14:42.290
My mother believed in God,

14:42.358 --> 14:43.858
but all the praying in the world

14:43.926 --> 14:46.561
didn't stop my stepfather
from terrorizing her.

14:46.629 --> 14:49.230
And her faith just seemed
to put her in harm's way.

14:49.298 --> 14:51.633
I'm worried that Lisa's mother

14:51.700 --> 14:53.968
is going to do the same thing.

14:54.036 --> 14:57.639
Dunham.

14:57.706 --> 14:58.740
Hello?

14:58.808 --> 15:00.108
Agent Dunham?

15:00.176 --> 15:02.610
It's Lisa Donovan. Lisa.

15:02.678 --> 15:04.379
Are you okay?

15:04.447 --> 15:06.881
It hasn't stopped.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.484
I'm seeing him again, Andrew Rusk.

15:09.552 --> 15:10.852
Where's your mother?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.054
She's at home, but I'm not.

15:13.122 --> 15:16.057
I had to come here. I
keep seeing this place.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.625
Okay, where are you?

15:17.693 --> 15:21.830
Lisa?

15:21.897 --> 15:25.733
Lisa, where are you?

15:34.443 --> 15:35.810
Olivia.

15:35.878 --> 15:39.280
Hey, you all right?

15:39.348 --> 15:41.950
He... he was here.

15:42.017 --> 15:43.618
Who was here?

15:45.788 --> 15:46.821
I can see him.

15:46.889 --> 15:48.189
Andrew Rusk.

15:48.257 --> 15:49.624
There's someone else.

15:49.692 --> 15:50.692
Another man.

15:50.759 --> 15:52.026
He has a gun.

15:54.396 --> 15:56.397
- Lisa?
- He shot him.

15:58.367 --> 15:59.400
He killed him.

15:59.468 --> 16:00.635
He killed Andrew Rusk.

16:00.703 --> 16:02.871
Lisa, do you know the other man?

16:02.938 --> 16:05.206
Did you...  did you see his face?

16:05.274 --> 16:07.208
No.

16:07.276 --> 16:10.245
But you're sure that...
 that they were here.

16:10.312 --> 16:11.513
Yes.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.381
Olivia.

16:13.449 --> 16:15.483
Found a .9 millimeter shell casing.

16:20.389 --> 16:21.689
Here you go.

16:21.757 --> 16:23.424
Not the most stylish, I know,

16:23.492 --> 16:24.526
but it will keep you warm.

16:24.593 --> 16:26.794
So I just talked to your mother,

16:26.862 --> 16:28.229
and she is on her way here.

16:28.297 --> 16:30.565
- Is she mad?
- No.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.333
She's just glad that you're okay.

16:33.969 --> 16:35.403
Hey, Liv.

16:35.471 --> 16:37.772
What is it?

16:37.840 --> 16:40.608
Why don't we just
stay here for a second?

16:40.676 --> 16:42.810
Come get in the car. You can get warm.

16:48.284 --> 16:50.218
It's Andrew Rusk.

16:50.286 --> 16:52.287
Your girl was right.

16:56.759 --> 16:58.126
Olivia, I need some help!

16:59.295 --> 17:00.595
What happened?

17:00.663 --> 17:01.896
I don't know. She just started to seize.

17:09.817 --> 17:11.617
I just talked to the medical examiner.

17:11.685 --> 17:13.353
He confirmed that Rusk was killed

17:13.421 --> 17:15.021
by a bullet wound to the head.

17:15.089 --> 17:17.290
Ruled out suicide.

17:17.358 --> 17:19.092
So everything Lisa told us pans out.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.660
Except one thing.

17:20.728 --> 17:22.529
According to the rigor of the body,

17:22.596 --> 17:24.364
Rusk has been dead for three days.

17:24.432 --> 17:26.665
Well, then, how would he
have been communicating

17:26.733 --> 17:28.868
with Lisa Donovan?

17:28.936 --> 17:32.138
Was the medical examiner more specific?

17:32.206 --> 17:33.440
About the time of death, I mean.

17:33.507 --> 17:35.442
Between 5:00 and 7:00 a.m.

17:35.509 --> 17:36.843
Why?

17:36.911 --> 17:38.445
Interesting.

17:38.512 --> 17:39.713
How is she?

17:39.780 --> 17:41.748
Your daughter suffered a
fairly substantial seizure.

17:41.816 --> 17:43.083
Oh, my God.

17:43.150 --> 17:44.217
But she's responsive now,

17:44.285 --> 17:45.552
and her condition is stable.

17:45.619 --> 17:47.253
She's lucky.

17:47.321 --> 17:49.422
I don't think there's gonna
be any permanent damage.

17:49.490 --> 17:51.257
Is this because of her aneurysm?

17:51.325 --> 17:53.393
No, there's no connection
between the two.

17:53.461 --> 17:55.628
I don't understand.

17:55.696 --> 17:56.796
You said she was fine,

17:56.864 --> 17:58.231
but she keeps getting sicker.

17:58.299 --> 17:59.299
What's causing this?

17:59.366 --> 18:01.568
We'll run some tests,

18:01.635 --> 18:03.803
but, with seizures,

18:03.871 --> 18:05.305
the cause is often unknowable.

18:05.372 --> 18:10.176
You mean... this could happen again?

18:10.244 --> 18:11.678
We just don't know.

18:11.746 --> 18:15.348
But you should be able to see Lisa soon.

18:17.184 --> 18:19.819
Excuse me.

18:19.887 --> 18:23.256
What time did your
daughter's resurrection

18:23.324 --> 18:25.158
- take place?
- Her resurrection?

18:25.226 --> 18:26.826
Just after 5:00 in the morning.

18:26.894 --> 18:29.796
Exactly as I suspected.

18:29.864 --> 18:32.632
Walter.

18:32.700 --> 18:33.633
What are you thinking?

18:33.701 --> 18:36.536
I propose that Rusk's murder

18:36.604 --> 18:39.005
and Lisa's rebirth
happened simultaneously.

18:39.073 --> 18:43.409
In fact, it was his
suddenly dispatched energy

18:43.477 --> 18:45.445
which jumpstarted the girl's body

18:45.513 --> 18:47.380
- and brought her back to life.
- That's absurd.

18:52.019 --> 18:54.220
Perhaps it is.

18:54.288 --> 18:56.723
Mm.

18:56.791 --> 19:02.328
Please allow me a moment
to entertain my fantasies.

19:02.396 --> 19:04.230
They often lead to a truth.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.269
It's possible that Rusk's energy

19:09.336 --> 19:11.838
brought some of his memories with it.

19:11.906 --> 19:14.674
And it is these memories
trapped within her,

19:14.742 --> 19:16.242
fighting to get out.

19:16.310 --> 19:19.379
Are you suggesting that
Lisa is...possessed?

19:19.446 --> 19:22.015
I wasn't.

19:22.082 --> 19:24.517
But now that you mention it,

19:24.585 --> 19:26.252
I wouldn't be surprised

19:26.320 --> 19:31.057
if numerous possessions were
in fact misdiagnosed cases

19:31.125 --> 19:33.092
of a phenomenon we are
just now discovering.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.495
- I hardly think that's what's happened here.
- Oh, you hardly would

19:35.563 --> 19:38.498
- because the church doesn't approve of exorcism anymore.
- Walter.

19:38.566 --> 19:40.533
No, because they are
merely superstition...

19:40.601 --> 19:43.670
because there are examples
of casting out spirits

19:43.737 --> 19:45.738
right through the Bible, father.

19:45.806 --> 19:46.739
Can you help her?

19:46.807 --> 19:48.708
Maureen, what are you doing?

19:48.776 --> 19:49.909
I have been praying,

19:49.977 --> 19:54.581
hoping that Lisa will get better.

19:54.648 --> 19:55.715
But she's not.

19:55.783 --> 19:57.917
If what you're saying is true,

19:57.985 --> 20:00.353
and this man's memories
are making Lisa sick,

20:00.421 --> 20:02.856
can you...

20:02.923 --> 20:06.359
can you get these memories out?

20:06.427 --> 20:09.262
Can you help my daughter?

20:13.267 --> 20:15.401
I will need to have
your daughter transferred

20:15.469 --> 20:18.872
- to my lab.
- Okay.

20:18.939 --> 20:23.776
Are you sure an exorcism
is gonna work, Walter?

20:23.844 --> 20:27.080
No, not at all.

20:27.147 --> 20:28.915
Unfortunately, I think I'm wrong.

20:28.983 --> 20:30.516
I can't explain the seizures.

20:30.584 --> 20:34.487
I believe that Rusk's energy
would reanimate the girl

20:34.555 --> 20:37.857
and carry his memories, but...

20:37.925 --> 20:41.694
It doesn't suggest why she's sick.

20:41.762 --> 20:45.298
I was just so angry the
way that man challenged me.

20:45.366 --> 20:48.835
Walter, her mother is about to
check her out of the hospital.

20:48.903 --> 20:51.638
I have no idea what I'm
going to do with her.

20:56.043 --> 20:58.144
We got to go in there and tell her.

21:03.183 --> 21:04.817
Olivia. What are you thinking?

21:04.885 --> 21:07.754
If Rusk is sick, could
that make Lisa sick too?

21:07.821 --> 21:11.824
What, like... his illnesses
would be transferred

21:11.892 --> 21:12.992
along with his spirit?

21:13.060 --> 21:14.794
You want to know what I think,

21:14.862 --> 21:17.030
- or what Walter would think?
- Either.

21:17.097 --> 21:19.465
Well, you read Rusk's file.

21:19.533 --> 21:20.967
Is there anything in there
to suggest that he was sick?

21:21.035 --> 21:22.669
No.

21:22.736 --> 21:25.171
But that was the navy's
official medical records.

21:25.239 --> 21:28.274
Well, you know me.

21:28.342 --> 21:29.442
If you tell me the US Government

21:29.510 --> 21:30.777
is covering something up,

21:30.844 --> 21:34.047
I'll tell you it must be Tuesday.

21:35.816 --> 21:36.883
Commander Turlough,

21:36.951 --> 21:38.952
thank you for coming back to talk to me.

21:39.019 --> 21:40.086
Not a problem.

21:40.154 --> 21:43.022
Um, I was already here
when agent broyles told me

21:43.090 --> 21:44.557
you found Andy Rusk's body.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.960
Listen, why didn't you
tell me he was sick?

21:47.027 --> 21:49.195
I... I'm sorry.

21:53.167 --> 21:54.334
Who told you that?

21:55.536 --> 21:57.070
You did.

21:57.137 --> 21:58.705
Just then.

21:58.772 --> 22:01.607
What was wrong with him?

22:01.675 --> 22:04.143
Was it something that happened
onboard the Gloucester?

22:08.349 --> 22:11.584
A young girl's life is on the line.

22:16.623 --> 22:17.590
They were shadowing

22:17.658 --> 22:18.958
a Russian naval exercise

22:19.026 --> 22:21.127
in North Korean waters six months ago

22:21.195 --> 22:23.596
when a coolant line broke,
causing a reactor leak.

22:23.664 --> 22:25.598
Rusk was locked in
the engineering section

22:25.666 --> 22:26.733
for 16 hours

22:26.800 --> 22:29.302
before they were able to
vent the contamination.

22:29.370 --> 22:31.404
Radiation.

22:31.472 --> 22:33.272
How could he possibly have survived?

22:33.340 --> 22:35.241
He was airlifted to pearl harbor,

22:35.309 --> 22:37.577
where he was given a highly experimental

22:37.644 --> 22:39.946
radiation inhibitor.

22:40.014 --> 22:43.082
He's been on medical
leave since the accident.

22:46.220 --> 22:49.055
I'm gonna need his medical records.

22:49.123 --> 22:50.790
The real ones.

22:54.161 --> 22:55.762
We can't keep stalling, Dr. Bishop.

22:55.829 --> 22:59.032
You can't think of anything to do?

23:00.601 --> 23:04.003
Maybe I could tell them that
my stomach is troubling me.

23:04.071 --> 23:06.005
That is not what I mean.

23:06.073 --> 23:09.509
Walter, I have Rusk's medical file here.

23:09.576 --> 23:11.677
Does any of that mean anything to you?

23:14.515 --> 23:16.516
"Radiation poisoning."

23:16.583 --> 23:19.786
That's why she had the seizure.

23:19.853 --> 23:24.590
The radiation and the synthetic
treatments they gave him.

23:24.658 --> 23:27.527
I'd wager that's what kept
his energy from dispersing.

23:27.594 --> 23:29.162
And you think that's how he was able

23:29.229 --> 23:30.296
to inhabit Lisa.

23:30.364 --> 23:34.333
Which means we need more drugs.

23:34.401 --> 23:39.338
Uh, uh, to calm Lisa's conscious mind.

23:39.406 --> 23:40.573
To relax her brain.

23:40.641 --> 23:43.109
Which should enable Mr.
Rusk's mental energy...

23:43.177 --> 23:45.378
his memories...  to slowly

23:45.446 --> 23:46.913
and painlessly leave her mind.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.181
What kind of drugs?

23:48.248 --> 23:50.016
Benzodiazepine.

23:50.084 --> 23:52.151
It's a hypnotic sedative.

23:52.219 --> 23:54.353
May cause a slight tingling sensation.

23:54.421 --> 23:55.688
It's actually quite pleasant.

23:55.756 --> 23:57.256
Besides, your daughter is 17.

23:57.324 --> 24:00.827
I'm sure she's sampled far worse by now.

24:00.894 --> 24:03.463
Agent Farnsworth, prepare an IV drip,

24:03.530 --> 24:07.033
uh, 100 Mikes to begin per liter.

24:09.503 --> 24:11.003
This is just gonna make
you a little sleepy.

24:11.071 --> 24:13.339
So are you, like, a doctor?

24:13.407 --> 24:15.408
No.

24:15.476 --> 24:16.809
But I promise you this won't hurt.

24:16.877 --> 24:18.311
It's okay.

24:18.378 --> 24:19.712
It's kind of nice to have someone

24:19.780 --> 24:20.746
not afraid of me.

24:20.814 --> 24:22.248
What do you mean?

24:22.316 --> 24:26.119
Well, my friends at church.

24:26.186 --> 24:27.487
When I walked past them,

24:27.554 --> 24:29.722
I could feel them all talking
about me behind my back.

24:29.790 --> 24:32.391
Kids at school are even worse.

24:32.459 --> 24:34.861
Ever since what's happened,

24:34.928 --> 24:36.662
they think I'm, like,
a freak or something.

24:36.730 --> 24:39.065
Well, I don't think you
have to worry about us here.

24:39.133 --> 24:41.067
We're kind of partial
to freaks in this lab.

24:47.107 --> 24:48.040
How's it going?

24:48.108 --> 24:49.041
It's smashing.

24:50.677 --> 24:52.445
Gene agrees with me, don't you, gene?

24:52.513 --> 24:55.715
So is agent Dunham,
like, your girlfriend?

24:55.782 --> 24:58.451
No. No.

24:58.519 --> 24:59.986
She's like a friend who's a girl.

25:00.053 --> 25:02.455
And who carries a gun.

25:03.524 --> 25:04.790
Walter, Astrid told me

25:04.858 --> 25:07.193
that you think you may be
able to extract Rusk's thoughts

25:07.261 --> 25:08.628
from Lisa's brain.

25:08.695 --> 25:09.762
I believe so. Yes.

25:09.830 --> 25:11.097
Okay, well, if that's the case,

25:11.165 --> 25:12.565
do you think that she would have access

25:12.633 --> 25:14.233
to his memories?

25:14.301 --> 25:16.269
Maybe describe his last moments.

25:16.336 --> 25:19.205
Oh, you... you want to
find out who killed him.

25:19.273 --> 25:21.841
Yeah.

25:21.909 --> 25:23.342
Well.

25:23.410 --> 25:26.646
Well, let's see, shall we?

25:29.149 --> 25:30.316
- Peter.
- Yeah.

25:30.384 --> 25:31.384
Strap Lisa down, please.

25:31.451 --> 25:33.152
Are straps really necessary?

25:33.220 --> 25:34.754
It's just a precaution.

25:34.821 --> 25:36.389
Just tell me if they're
too tight, all right?

25:36.456 --> 25:37.590
Okay.

25:37.658 --> 25:39.425
How are you feeling, Lisa?

25:39.493 --> 25:42.328
My toes are beginning to tingle and...

25:42.396 --> 25:43.729
Oh, that's good.

25:43.797 --> 25:45.831
That means it's working.

25:45.899 --> 25:47.700
Dr. Bishop, we're at 6 hertz.

25:49.570 --> 25:51.137
Peter. Yeah.

25:51.205 --> 25:53.506
Increase the drip 2 mikes, please. Done.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.843
I don't think I like how this feels.

25:57.911 --> 25:59.512
Lisa, it's okay.

25:59.580 --> 26:03.082
No. No, I think I want this to stop.

26:03.150 --> 26:04.483
Maybe we should slow this down.

26:04.551 --> 26:06.152
You know what, Lisa,
this is actually normal.

26:06.220 --> 26:08.955
It's okay. Just relax.
I'm gonna be right here.

26:09.022 --> 26:10.923
You're safe. Lisa, just...

26:10.991 --> 26:12.959
just close your eyes.

26:13.026 --> 26:14.260
Uh, mm.

26:14.328 --> 26:16.395
Close your eyes. This
is going to help you.

26:16.463 --> 26:17.496
Now breathe.

26:17.564 --> 26:18.998
Breathe deeply.

26:19.066 --> 26:22.735
Just let it go, Lisa. Let it go.

26:29.576 --> 26:30.810
Lisa.

26:32.546 --> 26:36.115
It's Agent Dunham. Can you hear me?

26:36.183 --> 26:37.883
Hi.

26:39.853 --> 26:41.487
I want you to think about Andrew Rusk.

26:45.759 --> 26:46.993
Oh, oh, look, look, look.

26:47.060 --> 26:48.527
This is surprising.

26:48.595 --> 26:50.363
Surprising good or surprising bad?

26:51.431 --> 26:53.966
Lisa! She's seizing!

26:54.034 --> 26:55.601
No, she's not.

26:55.669 --> 26:56.702
Lisa.

26:56.770 --> 26:58.471
You've gotta stop this right now.

26:58.538 --> 27:00.673
I'm afraid we have to
let it run its course.

27:00.741 --> 27:03.309
Where am i?

27:03.377 --> 27:05.511
Lisa. It's mom. I'm right here.

27:05.579 --> 27:08.981
Who...is...Lisa?

27:09.049 --> 27:10.349
Why is she talking this way?

27:10.417 --> 27:12.184
Because I believe

27:12.252 --> 27:15.121
this is not your daughter
speaking any more.

27:19.902 --> 27:23.026
- What's wrong with my daughter?
- Appears that my hypothesis...

27:24.294 --> 27:29.065
Lisa's mind was harboring Mr.
Rusk's memories... was wrong.

27:29.132 --> 27:29.933
It would seem more likely

27:31.001 --> 27:32.201
that Mr. Rusk's entire consciousness

27:32.269 --> 27:33.703
was transferred to Lisa.

27:33.770 --> 27:34.871
His consciousness.

27:34.839 --> 27:36.272
Perhaps his soul.

27:37.842 --> 27:39.342
Well, then where is Lisa?

27:41.145 --> 27:42.245
Merely suppressed.

27:42.312 --> 27:45.081
Asleep in her own mind.

27:45.149 --> 27:46.149
I want this stopped.

27:46.216 --> 27:47.650
I'm afraid I can't do that.

27:47.718 --> 27:49.285
What do you mean you can't?

27:49.353 --> 27:51.220
We can't stop the experiment.

27:51.288 --> 27:52.889
The drugs have taken effect.

27:52.956 --> 27:54.824
We must let the experiment
complete the system.

27:54.892 --> 27:56.993
Listen, let's go out and
get some air, Miss Donovan.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.127
I can't leave her.

27:58.195 --> 28:01.464
Miss Donovan, you have asked me to help.

28:01.532 --> 28:03.199
Please let me do my work.

28:08.972 --> 28:11.507
I can't lose her again.

28:11.575 --> 28:12.742
I understand.

28:12.809 --> 28:14.310
She's going to be fine.

28:24.388 --> 28:25.888
Can I talk to him?

28:25.956 --> 28:28.024
To Rusk?

28:28.092 --> 28:30.159
I hope so.

28:30.227 --> 28:33.096
Maybe the only way to coax him out.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.434
My name is Olivia.
Do you know your name?

28:40.104 --> 28:41.237
I believe that somebody

28:41.305 --> 28:42.839
hurt you and I want to
find out who that was.

28:42.906 --> 28:44.373
Let me go!

28:44.441 --> 28:45.675
Andrew. Andrew.

28:45.742 --> 28:47.310
Who killed you? Who did this to you?

28:58.155 --> 29:00.089
I called my wife.

29:00.157 --> 29:02.325
Told her I was getting a beer.

29:03.627 --> 29:07.063
There was someone in my car.

29:07.131 --> 29:09.565
In the back seat.

29:09.633 --> 29:10.566
Told me

29:10.634 --> 29:13.769
"pull over here."

29:13.837 --> 29:15.738
"Get out."

29:15.806 --> 29:18.975
"Walk."

29:19.042 --> 29:21.010
"I said walk!"

29:21.078 --> 29:24.480
"Get on your knees!"

29:24.548 --> 29:28.317
I'm not going out like that.

29:28.385 --> 29:30.486
Let me go!

29:30.554 --> 29:32.188
Andrew. Andrew!

29:32.256 --> 29:33.422
Who killed you?

29:33.490 --> 29:35.191
Give me a name.

29:40.364 --> 29:41.664
Don't know his name.

29:41.732 --> 29:43.366
Just...

29:43.433 --> 29:46.035
His blood.

29:49.239 --> 29:51.474
His left arm.

29:51.542 --> 29:52.942
Walter. Walter.

29:54.444 --> 29:57.313
Peter, turn off the drip.

29:57.381 --> 29:59.015
Okay, I'm gonna call the local hospitals

29:59.082 --> 30:01.684
and see if anybody's gone
in with an injured left arm.

30:16.466 --> 30:17.733
Peter.

30:18.735 --> 30:19.702
Hey.

30:19.770 --> 30:22.238
She's coming out of it!

30:22.306 --> 30:23.406
Hi.

30:23.473 --> 30:26.242
Hi.

30:26.310 --> 30:28.544
Did it work?

30:28.612 --> 30:30.346
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.348
It's her.

30:32.416 --> 30:34.350
Let's get you out of this.

30:34.418 --> 30:35.384
Dunham.

30:35.452 --> 30:37.119
We got a hit.

30:37.187 --> 30:38.688
Jake Selleg, age 36,

30:38.755 --> 30:41.691
walked into a Roxbury
ER three nights ago.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.392
Lacerations on his left arm.

30:43.460 --> 30:46.062
You know, Liv, Jake Selleg

30:46.129 --> 30:47.663
was navy too, okay?

30:47.731 --> 30:50.099
Now, he trained with seal team six.

30:50.167 --> 30:51.767
That's counter terrorism.

30:51.835 --> 30:53.869
That can't be a
coincidence. Is he local?

30:53.937 --> 30:56.339
He works at a boxing gym in Dorchester.

30:56.406 --> 30:58.241
Okay. Can you send me the address?

30:58.308 --> 30:59.242
Sending it now.

30:59.309 --> 31:00.309
I'll meet you there.

31:00.377 --> 31:01.978
On my way.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.951
That's it. Nice. Nice cross.

31:12.823 --> 31:14.056
'Scuse me. FBI.

31:14.124 --> 31:15.725
I'm Agent Dunham. This is Agent Francis.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.493
We're looking for a Jake Selleg.

31:20.464 --> 31:21.931
Hey! Stop!

32:03.173 --> 32:05.775
Lisa. Hey.

32:05.842 --> 32:07.810
Lisa, there's no need for
you to be looking at that.

32:07.878 --> 32:12.315
This is him. Rusk.

32:12.382 --> 32:14.950
Yeah.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.719
Astrid's on her way back
right now with your mom.

32:16.787 --> 32:19.722
Hopefully, you'll be able
to put all this behind you

32:19.790 --> 32:21.957
in life and get back to normal soon.

32:23.327 --> 32:25.895
Can I have something to drink, please?

32:25.962 --> 32:27.463
Of course.

32:27.531 --> 32:29.732
Guessing you want something
other than fresh cow's milk.

32:29.800 --> 32:30.833
Okay.

32:30.901 --> 32:32.568
I'll be right back.

32:50.687 --> 32:51.687
Hey, Walter.

32:51.755 --> 32:54.256
You drink all the cream sodas again?

32:56.326 --> 32:59.261
What's wrong?

32:59.329 --> 33:01.797
Lisa's brain scan.

33:01.865 --> 33:04.400
I think she's still sleeping.

33:04.468 --> 33:06.335
Maybe you should take
a look out in the lab.

33:06.403 --> 33:08.070
Well, her brain waves...

33:08.138 --> 33:10.606
it appears that her signal
is still being masked

33:10.674 --> 33:13.142
by Rusk's dominant pattern.

33:14.945 --> 33:16.912
Rusk is still in control.

33:22.018 --> 33:23.018
Lisa.

33:26.857 --> 33:29.191
Where is she?

33:30.227 --> 33:31.660
Where's my daughter?

33:36.347 --> 33:38.882
This is a slug we pulled
from Andrew Rusk's head.

33:38.949 --> 33:43.319
Our ballistic unit's
matching it as we speak

33:43.387 --> 33:45.622
from the .9 millimeter we
found in your apartment.

33:45.689 --> 33:47.023
I guess the navy did a poor job

33:47.091 --> 33:49.959
training you to clean
up after your work.

33:50.027 --> 33:50.960
Hey.

33:51.028 --> 33:54.030
Who ordered you to kill Andrew Rusk?

33:56.534 --> 33:58.501
Was he threatening to go public

33:58.569 --> 34:00.069
over the meltdown on the gloucester?

34:00.137 --> 34:03.540
Did the navy have you kill Andrew Rusk?

34:05.242 --> 34:06.976
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

34:09.313 --> 34:10.380
I spent seven years in the navy

34:10.447 --> 34:12.982
and I never killed a man.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.652
But Andrew Rusk deserved it.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.719
I'm proud I killed that dirt bag.

34:17.788 --> 34:19.255
What do you mean he "deserved it"?

34:19.322 --> 34:23.393
For what that bastard did to his wife.

34:30.734 --> 34:31.833
Rusk's wife.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.570
What does this have to do with her?

34:33.637 --> 34:37.072
I hang out at a bar she tends at.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.875
She told me about Andy.

34:38.943 --> 34:42.245
How he beats on her.

34:42.313 --> 34:45.380
One day she came in with a broken arm.

34:46.884 --> 34:49.985
She couldn't deal with it any more.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.955
No one should have to live like that.

34:52.022 --> 34:54.623
Teresa Rusk hired you
to kill her husband?

34:58.862 --> 35:03.232
In the scrapyard, he
kept asking me "why me?"

35:03.300 --> 35:05.969
So I gave him the answer.

35:06.036 --> 35:08.137
I pulled the trigger,

35:08.205 --> 35:11.374
but I made sure that i
told him that it was Teresa

35:11.442 --> 35:12.542
who was sending him to hell.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.378
You said that to Rusk?

35:15.446 --> 35:18.348
Before you killed him, you
told him his wife hired you?

35:21.518 --> 35:23.152
Yes, ma'am.

35:33.097 --> 35:34.864
Okay.

35:34.932 --> 35:36.532
Why didn't Rusk tell us that?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.334
He told us everything else.

35:38.402 --> 35:40.803
Why not that?

35:40.871 --> 35:42.171
Dunham.

35:42.239 --> 35:44.040
Olivia, Rusk is still controlling Lisa

35:44.108 --> 35:47.076
and she's gone.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.578
I think I know where he's going.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.313
Rusk's wife had him killed.

35:50.381 --> 35:52.081
I think he's going for revenge.

36:00.891 --> 36:02.458
What the hell are you doing in my house?

36:02.526 --> 36:05.161
Maya Svyozdichka.

36:05.229 --> 36:08.498
What did you say to me?

36:09.900 --> 36:11.768
How... how did you know to call me that?

36:13.904 --> 36:15.938
You're... you're that girl.

36:16.006 --> 36:18.141
You... you get out of here.

36:18.208 --> 36:19.208
I... I have a gun.

36:19.276 --> 36:23.846
Upstairs. In a safe.

36:23.914 --> 36:25.581
This gun...

36:25.649 --> 36:29.552
That I got you from the service.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.155
How do you...

36:32.222 --> 36:34.557
I... I don't understand.

36:34.625 --> 36:37.560
Well, neither do I.

36:37.628 --> 36:40.063
But I've been given a second chance.

36:40.130 --> 36:42.999
And I'm sure as hell
not going to waste it.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.468
Now get down on your knees.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.236
Okay. Okay.

36:55.179 --> 36:56.746
Don't do this.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.147
Please!

36:58.215 --> 36:59.749
You had me killed.

36:59.817 --> 37:01.217
Put down like a dog.

37:01.285 --> 37:03.453
I want to hear you say it.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.721
I didn't have you killed.

37:04.788 --> 37:06.289
I don't know what you're talking about!

37:06.356 --> 37:09.225
That's the thing about being
with someone for 20 years,

37:09.293 --> 37:10.960
you know when they lie,

37:11.028 --> 37:12.762
how they lie.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.998
Admit what you did.

37:16.066 --> 37:17.066
Don't.

37:20.471 --> 37:22.505
- Dunham.
- It's me. Where are you?

37:22.573 --> 37:23.940
We're five minutes out. Where are you?

37:24.007 --> 37:25.108
I'm just pulling up.

37:32.149 --> 37:34.350
Please don't do this.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.952
Please!

37:36.019 --> 37:37.954
Admit that you had me killed.

37:38.021 --> 37:39.622
Don't you want to die
with a clean conscience?

37:39.690 --> 37:40.757
Please!

37:40.824 --> 37:43.059
Don't! Stop!

37:48.198 --> 37:49.465
Don't do this.

37:49.533 --> 37:52.068
I'll give you one chance
to back out of here

37:52.136 --> 37:54.170
or we're all going out together.

37:54.238 --> 37:55.671
You know I can't do that.

37:55.739 --> 37:58.207
Then you're making a mistake.

38:04.468 --> 38:05.936
You don't have to do this.

38:06.003 --> 38:07.938
I already told you to leave once.

38:08.005 --> 38:09.839
I am not gonna tell you again.

38:16.881 --> 38:18.481
You know, I understand.

38:18.549 --> 38:20.951
What you said back at the lab.

38:21.018 --> 38:26.723
When I was in school,
Lisa, I was different too.

38:26.791 --> 38:29.726
I was always sick. I didn't
have any real friends.

38:29.794 --> 38:31.294
What the hell are you talking about?

38:31.362 --> 38:34.431
I'm telling you that I understand, Lisa.

38:34.498 --> 38:35.832
You got to stop calling me Lisa.

38:35.900 --> 38:37.000
I know what it feels like

38:37.068 --> 38:38.301
to feel different all the time.

38:38.369 --> 38:39.603
I'm gonna count to one.

38:39.670 --> 38:40.804
Lisa, listen to me.

38:40.871 --> 38:42.572
You've been given a second chance here,

38:42.640 --> 38:43.840
but you have to fight for it.

38:47.411 --> 38:48.645
One!

39:01.726 --> 39:02.659
Peter.

39:02.727 --> 39:04.694
Yeah?

39:04.762 --> 39:06.496
What happened?

39:06.564 --> 39:07.664
Well, I'll tell you all about it,

39:07.732 --> 39:10.433
but not right now, okay?

39:10.501 --> 39:12.602
Right now you need to rest.

39:14.672 --> 39:16.106
So they're gonna take
you to the hospital,

39:16.173 --> 39:17.140
and get you checked out,

39:17.208 --> 39:18.508
and make sure that everything's okay.

39:18.576 --> 39:20.543
And then they'll bring
you back to the lab.

39:20.611 --> 39:22.012
And we'll meet you there.

39:22.079 --> 39:24.748
Okay. Okay.

39:27.618 --> 39:29.185
How'd you know it would work,

39:29.253 --> 39:30.520
that you could reach her?

39:30.588 --> 39:33.123
Walter's book of Tibetan philosophy.

39:33.190 --> 39:35.125
"Innermost subtle
consciousness is ever present.

39:35.192 --> 39:37.494
It never leaves the body even in death."

39:37.561 --> 39:39.696
You got a lot of
mileage out of a coaster.

39:39.764 --> 39:41.097
Yeah.

39:41.165 --> 39:43.566
In other words, I threw up a hail mary.

39:45.970 --> 39:49.172
Perfectly normal.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.573
Singular consciousness.

39:50.641 --> 39:52.442
Lisa's.

39:52.510 --> 39:53.710
Which means he's gone.

39:53.778 --> 39:55.779
I believe so.

39:58.616 --> 40:01.184
I would propose that
Mr. Rusk stuck around

40:01.252 --> 40:02.919
to deal with unfinished business.

40:02.987 --> 40:04.688
And once he did,

40:04.755 --> 40:06.556
then, well, Lisa was free

40:06.624 --> 40:09.392
to finally purge herself of him.

40:09.460 --> 40:11.795
How can we be sure?

40:16.701 --> 40:21.738
NisI credideritis, non intelligentis.

40:21.806 --> 40:23.540
I don't understand.

40:23.607 --> 40:27.544
It's a Latin translation of Isaiah 7:9.

40:27.611 --> 40:32.549
"Unless you believe,

40:32.616 --> 40:34.484
you will not understand."

40:37.254 --> 40:38.688
Even as a scientist,

40:38.756 --> 40:42.459
sometimes I have to rely on faith.

40:44.762 --> 40:47.097
God keep you and yours safe, Dr. Bishop.

40:51.702 --> 40:53.536
And you, ma'am.

40:54.939 --> 40:56.206
Come along, Lisa.

40:56.273 --> 40:58.942
Time to go home.

40:59.009 --> 41:01.177
- You all set, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

41:10.321 --> 41:11.821
Oh.

41:17.261 --> 41:18.728
Okay.

41:18.796 --> 41:20.230
Take care.

41:28.339 --> 41:29.472
Thank you again, Agent Dunham.

41:29.540 --> 41:31.775
It's Olivia. And you're welcome.

41:31.842 --> 41:34.244
Thank you.

41:34.311 --> 41:35.879
Bye.

41:35.946 --> 41:37.380
I'll be 18 in a year.

41:37.448 --> 41:39.182
Don't wait to long to make your move.

41:48.058 --> 41:50.193
Well, the navy officially

41:50.261 --> 41:52.028
denied our request to
launch an investigation

41:52.096 --> 41:53.496
into the USS Gloucester.

41:53.564 --> 41:55.698
Well, there's a shocking surprise.

41:55.766 --> 41:58.435
Thinking about his
shipmates, I shouldn't worry.

41:58.502 --> 42:01.271
I suggest that Mr. Rusk's
postmortem adventures

42:01.338 --> 42:04.507
will prove to be the
exception rather than the rule.

42:04.575 --> 42:10.113
And if not, then we'll go
into the exorcism business.

42:10.181 --> 42:11.681
Is it just me

42:11.749 --> 42:12.982
or did you detect a note of excitement

42:13.050 --> 42:14.384
in his voice?

42:14.452 --> 42:17.253
'Cause I for one cannot wait
to get that guy out of here.

42:27.131 --> 42:28.932
He just jumped the curve.

42:45.983 --> 42:48.051
I'm not getting a pulse on this guy.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.162
Maya Svyozdichka.

42:59.230 --> 43:00.763
What'd he say?

43:00.831 --> 43:02.532
I think he's speaking Russian.

43:02.533 --> 43:06.533
