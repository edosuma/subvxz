00:09.140 --> 00:11.281
Uh, well, we
aren't sure exactly.

00:11.282 --> 00:13.183
Are you guys on vacation?

00:13.184 --> 00:14.544
We're on our honeymoon.
(Giggles) For real?

00:14.545 --> 00:17.187
Mm-hmm. Then let me hook
you up with a little highlight reel.

00:17.188 --> 00:18.648
You got your old city district,

00:18.649 --> 00:21.091
penn's landing,
independence hall,

00:21.092 --> 00:23.022
but I'm gonna swing
out to the love park first.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.724
Kick that honeymoon in gear.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.626
Hey! (Laughing) (Laughs)

00:26.627 --> 00:28.198
(Continues laughing)

00:28.199 --> 00:30.400
Sir?

00:30.401 --> 00:32.132
Sir, are you okay?

00:32.133 --> 00:34.033
(Tires screech)

00:34.034 --> 00:35.805
What?

00:35.806 --> 00:37.137
(Horn honks) Sir.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.209
Ben. Ben. Aah! Aah!

00:39.210 --> 00:42.212
(Tires screech)

00:42.213 --> 00:44.644
(Horns honk)

00:44.645 --> 00:46.216
Whoa!

00:46.217 --> 00:48.378
(Tires screech)

00:48.379 --> 00:50.220
(Man) Oh!

00:50.221 --> 00:53.383
(Woman) Help! Help 'em!

00:53.384 --> 00:55.225
(Man) Come on!
Let's try to help 'em!

00:55.226 --> 00:56.556
(Man) Call 9-1-1!

00:56.557 --> 00:58.088
(Man) Get that door open!

00:58.089 --> 00:59.059
(Woman) Did you see that?

00:59.060 --> 01:01.762
(Woman shouts indistinctly)

01:05.366 --> 01:06.736
(Keys jangle)

01:06.737 --> 01:08.768
Lacey, breakfast!

01:08.769 --> 01:12.642
I got bagels and that
raspberry smoothie you like.

01:12.643 --> 01:16.246
Uh, dear, you should know
better. Teenagers need protein.

01:16.247 --> 01:18.108
Why are you already here?

01:18.109 --> 01:20.410
The train doesn't
leave for hours.

01:20.411 --> 01:22.312
Well, it's not like I
have a job to go to.

01:22.313 --> 01:24.684
Plus, I'm already packed.
We could've made the 8:00.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.517
I had to stop by the office
and tie up some loose ends.

01:27.518 --> 01:30.690
I don't want to anything
to ruin our girls weekend.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.423
New York is gonna be so sick.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.195
"Sick" means "good,"

01:35.196 --> 01:38.097
which as a doctor, I find
particularly disturbing.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.169
Well, you see,
this is why I need

01:39.170 --> 01:40.500
to spend more time with Lacey.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.532
If I'm going to stay
viable in this job market,

01:42.533 --> 01:46.136
I'm going to have to young
down and hip the hell up.

01:46.137 --> 01:47.537
Oh, my god.

01:47.538 --> 01:49.479
I'm showing grandma how
to use social networking.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.780
Everyone's life is online now.

01:50.781 --> 01:52.542
Yeah, for work and for dating.

01:52.543 --> 01:54.544
My friend Sylvia instant
messaged her way

01:54.545 --> 01:56.115
to a third husband, you know?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.717
Did they have cyber sex, too?

01:57.718 --> 02:01.221
This whole romance-by-technology
thing is too weird.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.692
I'm gonna stick with the
old-fashioned method,

02:02.693 --> 02:04.394
thank you very much.

02:04.395 --> 02:05.725
It's been working
so well for you.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.857
(Chuckles) (Cell phone rings)

02:07.858 --> 02:09.799
Ah.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.131
(Ring)

02:12.132 --> 02:13.403
Oh, damn it.

02:13.404 --> 02:16.866
Don't worry. We're
gonna make the train.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.468
Megan hunt.

02:18.469 --> 02:20.139
(Police radio chatter)

02:20.140 --> 02:22.141
(Morris) Just make sure
there's no gates over there.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.274
(Man) Yes, sir.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.876
Well, look at you.

02:26.877 --> 02:30.280
Somebody better turn
that frown upside down.

02:30.281 --> 02:31.921
Zip it, flatfoot. I'm grumpy.

02:31.922 --> 02:35.225
You're usually snow white.

02:35.226 --> 02:37.156
Cab driver lost
consciousness at the wheel.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.259
His passengers.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.730
Where's the driver?

02:40.731 --> 02:43.233
Recovering. The medics
say he had a petit mal seizure.

02:43.234 --> 02:46.566
He slammed into a guy
named Joey jablonsky,

02:46.567 --> 02:48.167
in town from Baltimore.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.169
Then he's the victim?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.402
No. The only thing he's got is
a sore attitude. (Handcuffs click)

02:52.403 --> 02:54.644
(Speaks indistinctly) Well,
what the hell am I doing here?

02:54.645 --> 02:56.276
Good morning, sunshine.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.649
Better glove up. Our little
accident uncovered a murder.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.251
(Peter) Possible
through and through.

03:01.252 --> 03:04.354
A bullet entered the
chest and exited his back.

03:04.355 --> 03:06.756
No spatter in the car, so
he wasn't shot in the trunk.

03:06.757 --> 03:08.758
There's also a smudge
on his pants leg.

03:08.759 --> 03:11.321
Yeah, there's no I.D., but he
has some identifying marks.

03:11.322 --> 03:13.323
He has a mole on his cheek

03:13.324 --> 03:14.724
and he has a
birthmark on his neck.

03:14.725 --> 03:16.396
I'm gonna get some
prints and I'll run it

03:16.397 --> 03:17.767
through missing persons.

03:17.768 --> 03:19.399
And there goes New York.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.772
Look, I am just as bothered
by all of this as you are.

03:22.773 --> 03:24.604
The only thing
that bothers me is,

03:24.605 --> 03:26.736
if you hadn't gotten rear-ended,

03:26.737 --> 03:27.977
you might've gotten
away with murder.

03:27.978 --> 03:29.539
Oh, come on. Do I
look like the kind of guy

03:29.540 --> 03:30.840
that would do
something like that?

03:30.841 --> 03:32.742
Yeah, you kinda do.

03:32.743 --> 03:36.486
Look, look, I-I drove into town
yesterday morning from Baltimore

03:36.487 --> 03:37.917
to... to drum up some sales,

03:37.918 --> 03:39.319
because I own a
restaurant supply business,

03:39.320 --> 03:40.890
and sales have been way
down, so I wanted to meet

03:40.891 --> 03:43.293
some of my clients
face-to-face so I could...

03:43.294 --> 03:44.954
Look, I appreciate the
bio, but can you get back to

03:44.955 --> 03:46.926
the whole "you
killed a man" thing?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.428
No. No. I... no, I know. That's
what I'm trying to tell you.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.959
I-I haven't opened
the trunk of my car

03:49.960 --> 03:52.231
since... since I checked into
my hotel yesterday morning.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.604
Okay, s-somebody
else put the body there.

03:54.605 --> 03:56.266
And where would
that have happened?

03:56.267 --> 03:57.607
Beats me. I don't know. I
mean, I-I drove all over the city.

03:57.608 --> 04:01.010
I-I went to bars, hotels,
restaurants, wholesalers.

04:01.011 --> 04:03.513
Not a damn bite, by the
way, I mean, I thought this was

04:03.514 --> 04:05.315
supposed to be the
city of brotherly love.

04:05.316 --> 04:06.876
Hey, I'm not the
one driving around

04:06.877 --> 04:09.279
with a corpse in my trunk,
Baltimore. It wasn't me.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.581
Well, until this thing is sorted
out, you're sticking around.

04:11.582 --> 04:15.486
And I want a list of every
place you've parked your car.

04:26.697 --> 04:29.499
(Crying) That's my husband.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.941
That's Kyle.

04:31.942 --> 04:35.505
Would you like to...

04:35.506 --> 04:36.677
(Exhales deeply)

04:41.482 --> 04:42.712
(Sniffles)

04:42.713 --> 04:44.754
Last time I saw him...

04:44.755 --> 04:46.856
(Sniffles) Was yesterday morning

04:46.857 --> 04:48.918
when he was leaving for work.

04:48.919 --> 04:51.921
He was an architect...

04:51.922 --> 04:54.364
For the brand design group.

04:54.365 --> 04:57.467
He left me a voice
mail after lunch.

04:57.468 --> 04:59.869
He said... (Sighs deeply)

04:59.870 --> 05:01.601
(Cries)

05:01.602 --> 05:04.303
He said that he was
leaving work early,

05:04.304 --> 05:07.307
but then he never came home.

05:10.481 --> 05:12.582
(Sobs)

05:12.583 --> 05:13.743
(Gasps)

05:13.744 --> 05:16.617
Oh. (Gasps)

05:18.018 --> 05:19.749
My baby...

05:19.750 --> 05:21.491
She just kicked...

05:21.492 --> 05:25.455
(Sobs) For the first time.

05:25.456 --> 05:26.656
Okay.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.628
(Continues crying)

05:28.629 --> 05:29.799
(Morris) Thank you
for your time, Mr. Brand.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.431
Please, anything
I can do to help.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.833
Kyle was killed
yesterday afternoon,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.635
and his wife said
that he left work early.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.507
Do you have any idea
where he might've gone?

05:37.508 --> 05:39.869
I'm sorry. M... Maybe
I'm not understanding.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.841
Why would I know
where he was going?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.473
Well, I'm not being
accusatory, Mr. Brand...

05:43.474 --> 05:47.377
Listen, this economic
downturn hit my firm really hard.

05:47.378 --> 05:48.948
I wish I coulda
helped more people

05:48.949 --> 05:50.980
transition out of
the company, but...

05:50.981 --> 05:53.683
Wait. Transition out of here?

05:53.684 --> 05:55.985
Kyle. I had to lay him off.

05:55.986 --> 05:58.388
Yeah, he hasn't
worked here in a year.

05:58.389 --> 06:01.591
For a year? Where was
he going all that time?

06:01.592 --> 06:03.533
Why was he lying to his wife?

06:03.534 --> 06:06.436
Maybe he was a
bigamist or a spy.

06:06.437 --> 06:08.798
Or a bigamist spy.

06:08.799 --> 06:11.471
(Dramatic voice) Two
identities. Two families.

06:11.472 --> 06:16.476
In a polyamorous
world that time forgot...

06:16.477 --> 06:18.778
(Clicks tongue, normal voice)
I sent his clothes off to trace.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.380
Maybe we can find out what
he swiped on his pant leg.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.082
Maybe it came from
the crime scene.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.654
The one you haven't found yet?

06:24.655 --> 06:25.955
(Camera shutter
clicks) (Peter chuckles)

06:25.956 --> 06:27.487
There is something stuck

06:27.488 --> 06:31.120
between his lower right
central and lateral incisor.

06:31.121 --> 06:34.464
A bit of his last meal, perhaps?

06:34.465 --> 06:38.397
And there's a patterned band
of broken capillaries right there.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.501
It may be from a support belt. I
mean, maybe he had a bad back.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.434
Or maybe from doing
some heavy lifting.

06:44.435 --> 06:46.576
He's got calluses
on his fingers.

06:46.577 --> 06:49.408
Not exactly the workplace
injuries of an architect.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.180
Nor is this... laceration.

06:51.181 --> 06:52.842
It could be a stab wound.

06:52.843 --> 06:54.445
Let's roll him. Yeah.

06:57.047 --> 06:58.588
Oh, wow.

06:58.589 --> 07:00.590
Look at that abrasion collar.
(Camera shutter clicking)

07:00.591 --> 07:02.452
The exit wound is shored.

07:02.453 --> 07:03.753
Well, that would only happen

07:03.754 --> 07:06.556
if something hard was pressed
against him when he was shot.

07:06.557 --> 07:07.498
Like if he was lying
on the pavement.

07:07.499 --> 07:08.598
(Object rattles)

07:08.599 --> 07:11.801
Ooh. What do you know?

07:11.802 --> 07:13.033
Drop him.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.436
Huh.

07:17.868 --> 07:22.111
Gentlemen, we have a
through and through and through.

07:22.112 --> 07:24.674
The round entered his
chest, exited his back,

07:24.675 --> 07:25.815
ricocheted off something hard,

07:25.816 --> 07:27.717
and then reentered the body.

07:27.718 --> 07:29.448
What is that
lodged in the bullet?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.450
Is that a... rock?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.452
That is not just any rock.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.587
That, detective, is
your crime scene.

07:38.529 --> 07:42.462
(Fabric snaps)

07:46.797 --> 07:47.967
Kyle was laid off a year ago?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.039
I'm afraid so. His boss
Harvey brand confirmed it.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.942
But why wouldn't he tell me?

07:52.943 --> 07:56.005
What was he doing all this time?

07:56.006 --> 07:58.007
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

07:58.008 --> 08:00.680
Has your financial
situation changed at all

08:00.681 --> 08:02.011
in the past year?

08:02.012 --> 08:05.054
Yes. Um, when we
found out about the baby,

08:05.055 --> 08:07.086
I stopped working.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.518
Kyle told me not to worry,

08:08.519 --> 08:10.760
and our bills always got paid.

08:10.761 --> 08:13.823
(Megan) Mindy, Kyle
had suffered a lifting injury.

08:13.824 --> 08:15.795
Did he work out a
lot? Did he lift weights?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.797
No. I mean, he
cared about his health,

08:17.798 --> 08:20.530
but he didn't smoke,
he didn't drink.

08:20.531 --> 08:24.203
He also had a
severe cut on his arm.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.836
Do you know how that happened?

08:26.837 --> 08:27.977
I must seem like

08:27.978 --> 08:30.039
the most oblivious
person on earth right now.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.781
All I can say is,

08:31.782 --> 08:33.142
Kyle was my rock.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.685
He was up at 7:00 and
he left for work at 8:00

08:35.686 --> 08:37.947
and was home
every night for dinner.

08:37.948 --> 08:40.119
I knew him to be kind,

08:40.120 --> 08:43.092
thoughtful, trustworthy.

08:43.093 --> 08:46.596
But now after what
you're telling me...

08:46.597 --> 08:49.198
(Sighs)

08:49.199 --> 08:52.132
I guess I didn't
really know him at all.

08:53.904 --> 08:55.234
Curtis, what are we looking at?

08:55.235 --> 08:58.968
Uh, Gabrielle Diaz, 19,

08:58.969 --> 09:00.109
a possible drug overdose.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.141
White powder was found
on her nostrils and philtrum,

09:02.142 --> 09:03.643
empty vials nearby.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.144
Press is gonna eat that up, too.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.117
Her daddy's the Dean
of Dexter university.

09:08.118 --> 09:10.119
Yeah.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.621
Hold up.

09:11.622 --> 09:13.883
You already got a call
about this, didn't you?

09:13.884 --> 09:15.184
Antonio Diaz is
a close associate

09:15.185 --> 09:16.856
of health commissioner Travers.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.588
The one who appointed you chief.

09:18.589 --> 09:21.030
Let me guess. I'm off the case.

09:21.031 --> 09:22.992
Curtis, you understand...
I understand nothing.

09:22.993 --> 09:24.293
I can do the job just fine,

09:24.294 --> 09:26.095
high-profile or no profile.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.798
I've got a spotlight
following me at every turn,

09:28.799 --> 09:30.670
so the longer I can tap
dance without missing a step,

09:30.671 --> 09:33.003
the longer this department
can act with autonomy.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.646
Mm-hmm.

09:36.647 --> 09:38.948
(Object clatters)

09:38.949 --> 09:40.309
(Indistinct conversations)

09:40.310 --> 09:43.012
Oh, Dr. Hunt. I
checked with p.D.

09:43.013 --> 09:45.014
There's still no word
on our crime scene.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.286
They have had that
evidence for hours.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.988
Yeah, but it was just a pebble.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.820
But they're always after me
about finding cause of death.

09:50.821 --> 09:53.122
I have found a whole lot
more with a whole lot less.

09:53.123 --> 09:56.165
Uh, I do have photos
from lab, though.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.167
Looks like the
underside of the pebble

09:58.168 --> 10:00.199
is covered with some kind
of yellow reflective paint.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.132
You mean the kind of paint
that the city uses for the streets?

10:03.133 --> 10:04.634
Or crosswalks. Or Lane dividers.

10:04.635 --> 10:06.005
Yeah.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.177
So maybe Kyle was laying in
the street when he was shot.

10:08.178 --> 10:09.608
You know, that
guy Joey jablonsky

10:09.609 --> 10:11.110
wrote down all the
places he parked in town.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.382
Unless we can match one of
those locations to the pebble,

10:13.383 --> 10:15.184
we don't have a crime scene.

10:15.185 --> 10:16.146
Do me a favor.

10:16.147 --> 10:17.386
I know, I know. Stay on them.

10:17.387 --> 10:19.849
Just because you do your job

10:19.850 --> 10:22.051
doesn't mean other
people do theirs.

10:22.052 --> 10:24.093
I really hate being
quoted back to myself.

10:24.094 --> 10:25.624
I'm so sorry.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.996
Okay.

10:26.997 --> 10:30.129
(Joan) That little liar!

10:30.130 --> 10:31.661
You know all that grief
your mother gave us

10:31.662 --> 10:33.062
over social networking?

10:33.063 --> 10:34.734
Well, not only does
she have a profile,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.635
but she's logged in.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.937
No way.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.869
If she friends me, I'll die.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.070
Now be kind.

10:41.071 --> 10:43.112
She listed her hobbies as...

10:43.113 --> 10:44.914
"Neuroscience, solitaire,

10:44.915 --> 10:48.177
and aggressive political
discourse." (Laughs)

10:48.178 --> 10:51.120
She's gonna need all the friends
she can get. (Message alert blurps)

10:51.121 --> 10:52.753
(Lacey) A friend request?

10:54.324 --> 10:55.685
(Clicks mouse)

10:55.686 --> 10:57.026
(Lacey) Who's that?

10:57.027 --> 10:58.357
Yum, yum.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.929
Ooh, and so young.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.390
Grandma.

11:01.391 --> 11:03.432
Accept. (Chimes)

11:03.433 --> 11:05.134
(Laughs) You are totally evil.

11:05.135 --> 11:06.265
(Laughs)

11:06.266 --> 11:07.967
Do you know how
many relationships

11:07.968 --> 11:10.199
I've had to facilitate
for her over the years?

11:10.200 --> 11:11.801
(Blurps)

11:11.802 --> 11:13.773
Oh, my god.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.776
"Oh, my god" is right.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.407
He's gorgeous

11:18.408 --> 11:20.780
and very complimentary.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.281
(Keyboard keys click)

11:22.282 --> 11:24.113
Will you stop that? We're
gonna miss our train.

11:24.114 --> 11:26.716
No parent can ever stop
giving their child guidance,

11:26.717 --> 11:28.217
no matter how old they are.

11:28.218 --> 11:30.289
Give me five minutes.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.191
(Sighs)

11:32.192 --> 11:34.693
(Keyboard keys clicking)

11:34.694 --> 11:37.867
(Clears throat)

11:37.868 --> 11:39.398
Hey, Sam. (Cell phone beeps)

11:39.399 --> 11:41.100
Please tell me this
is the crime scene.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.272
Megan's texted me
a thousand times.

11:43.273 --> 11:45.234
Jablonsky parked at
18 different locations.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.306
We've searched
six. So far, nothing.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.978
I just got a call
on the way over.

11:48.979 --> 11:50.309
Guess who's name
showed up on a police report

11:50.310 --> 11:51.781
three days ago.

11:51.782 --> 11:53.112
Kyle Harrison.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.243
Really? What happened?

11:54.244 --> 11:56.045
He got into a fight with a
man named sal rubenstone

11:56.046 --> 11:57.716
at a house in upper darby.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.118
Maybe that's how he got cut.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.249
What was the fight about?

12:00.250 --> 12:02.251
I don't know, but sal
has recently done time

12:02.252 --> 12:04.393
for robbery and two
drunk and disorderlies.

12:04.394 --> 12:06.325
Doesn't take much
for him to anger up.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.498
Mm. Let's bring him in.

12:09.499 --> 12:11.130
(Morris) Bar fights, robbery...

12:11.131 --> 12:12.802
You might want to find a new way

12:12.803 --> 12:14.233
to channel that
anger there, sal.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.805
It's been a rough year.

12:15.806 --> 12:17.136
Little rougher for Kyle Harrison

12:17.137 --> 12:18.808
since he's dead.

12:18.809 --> 12:20.269
How'd you know him?

12:20.270 --> 12:22.111
We worked together
at brand design.

12:22.112 --> 12:23.242
I was a construction foreman.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.743
(Clears throat)

12:24.744 --> 12:27.016
When we both got the
shaft, we jumped around a lot,

12:27.017 --> 12:28.948
found it hard to
find solid work.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.950
So when I got a job last
month at a moving company,

12:30.951 --> 12:32.221
I recommended him.

12:32.222 --> 12:36.525
Oh, calluses, support belt...
Kyle worked as a mover.

12:36.526 --> 12:38.928
Eviction service
provider, actually.

12:38.929 --> 12:40.930
You see, a bank
forecloses on a house,

12:40.931 --> 12:43.392
owner doesn't want to
leave, they get forcibly evicted.

12:43.393 --> 12:45.764
We come in,
remove their property.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.837
That's charming.

12:47.838 --> 12:49.468
Why'd you two get in a fight?

12:49.469 --> 12:52.141
Sometimes when
we take out the stuff,

12:52.142 --> 12:54.103
there ain't no one
there to claim it.

12:54.104 --> 12:56.305
What, the bank's gonna care?

12:56.306 --> 12:57.907
So you were stealing?

12:57.908 --> 12:59.348
Couple things.

12:59.349 --> 13:03.082
Anyway, Kyle found out about
it and got all self-righteous.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.314
We got into it, and he got
sliced with my box cutter.

13:05.315 --> 13:06.286
That's it.

13:06.287 --> 13:07.516
That was an
accident, though, right?

13:07.517 --> 13:08.888
That's right.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.059
Come on, sal.

13:10.060 --> 13:11.891
Last week a box
cutter. This week a gun.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.462
I know what you're
getting at, but that ain't it.

13:13.463 --> 13:15.164
Kyle was good people.

13:15.165 --> 13:17.326
There ain't no job worth that.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.068
Cocaine?

13:19.069 --> 13:21.330
Mr. and Mrs. Diaz, please
accept my deepest condolences.

13:21.331 --> 13:24.874
I knew Gabriella
was having problems.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.335
But nothing like this.

13:26.336 --> 13:28.037
(Antonio) I enrolled
her at Dexter.

13:28.038 --> 13:30.409
Thought the environment
would motivate her.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.082
So busy taking care of
other people's children,

13:33.083 --> 13:34.413
I neglected my own daughter.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.946
I may not deserve it,

13:36.947 --> 13:38.888
but I'm going to ask
for your discretion.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.519
I would appreciate it if you
would keep this from the media.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.052
Rest assured, I'm going
to place a security hold

13:43.053 --> 13:44.353
on the autopsy records.

13:44.354 --> 13:48.898
This is and will
remain a private matter.

13:48.899 --> 13:50.059
(Elevator bell dings)

13:50.060 --> 13:51.300
(British accent) Hey, Megan.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.202
Yes. Can I help you?

13:53.203 --> 13:54.363
It's me, Aidan.

13:54.364 --> 13:56.365
Aidan welles.

13:56.366 --> 13:59.168
Uh, yeah, hey. Hey,
Aidan. How you doing?

13:59.169 --> 14:02.011
I'm sorry to pop by like this.
You probably think I'm crazy.

14:02.012 --> 14:04.013
(Indistinct conversations)

14:04.014 --> 14:07.076
Oh, my god. Aidan.

14:07.077 --> 14:09.348
The... the landscape
guy. (Laughs) Yeah.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.220
Wow. How many years?

14:11.221 --> 14:12.351
Look, I'm just gonna
be straight with you

14:12.352 --> 14:14.954
because, uh,
well, hell, why not?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.525
I know we were talking
about getting dinner soon,

14:16.526 --> 14:19.288
but I've always been a
"why not now?" Kind of a guy.

14:19.289 --> 14:21.860
Uh, I'm sorry.
Dinner? When did we...

14:21.861 --> 14:24.063
I pushed it. Damn it. I did.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.434
Um, I guess I just
got a vibe earlier

14:25.435 --> 14:27.266
when we were talking online.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.238
We didn't...

14:29.239 --> 14:31.140
Oh, my god. They didn't.

14:31.141 --> 14:32.371
Oh, my...

14:32.372 --> 14:34.343
No, that... that person
that you were talking to,

14:34.344 --> 14:35.905
that was not me. It wasn't?

14:35.906 --> 14:37.176
No, not me.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.378
Well, who... (Laughs)
Well, then who was it?

14:39.379 --> 14:43.152
(Chuckles) Let's just
say that when I find out,

14:43.153 --> 14:45.884
my family tree will
be missing a limb.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.386
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

14:47.387 --> 14:50.019
Right. Um...

14:50.020 --> 14:51.420
Well, then i'm...
I'm just gonna...

14:51.421 --> 14:52.392
I'm gonna back away... Uh, yeah.

14:52.393 --> 14:53.393
Slowly.

14:53.394 --> 14:58.027
Mm. I thought that was
probably too good to be true.

14:58.028 --> 15:00.599
What... was?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.131
Oh, uh, well...

15:02.132 --> 15:04.603
I really liked you back
then, when we met.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.305
And, uh, hearing that
you were single again

15:06.306 --> 15:08.437
kind of kick-started
my day. Regardless...

15:08.438 --> 15:09.409
(Ding)

15:09.410 --> 15:10.940
It was lovely seeing you again,

15:10.941 --> 15:12.411
and I'll... I'll be
on my merry way.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.343
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

15:14.344 --> 15:16.085
Oh, you know...

15:16.086 --> 15:17.947
(Ding) You came all this way.

15:17.948 --> 15:19.949
There... there's no reason why
we... we couldn't have dinner.

15:19.950 --> 15:23.152
I mean, I could
meet you somewhere.

15:23.153 --> 15:24.593
Yeah?

15:24.594 --> 15:26.325
Yeah. You sure?

15:26.326 --> 15:28.327
Sure. I wouldn't want to
twist your arm or anything.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.428
(Megan laughs)

15:29.429 --> 15:31.130
Okay, then. How
about Nick's on central?

15:31.131 --> 15:32.461
My favorite spot in the city.

15:32.462 --> 15:34.533
Okay. 7:00.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.505
Tomorrow.

15:36.506 --> 15:38.667
7:00.

15:38.668 --> 15:40.409
(Chuckles)

15:40.410 --> 15:43.613
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

15:45.415 --> 15:47.516
Check you out.

15:47.517 --> 15:50.549
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt
your romantic interlude.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.021
It was not romantic.

15:52.022 --> 15:53.952
Really? Neither is this.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.525
The trace you found on
Kyle Harrison's pants?

15:56.526 --> 15:59.658
We got the results.
It's adipocere.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.360
Adipocere? Mm-hmm.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.193
That's saponified fat
tissue. It's decomposition.

16:04.194 --> 16:06.295
Kyle was in contact
with a dead person.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.596
So that means

16:07.597 --> 16:11.471
there is another body out there.

16:16.306 --> 16:17.476
Hey, don't you ever
answer your texts?

16:17.477 --> 16:18.977
Not when you
write in all capitals.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.479
It's like yelling. It's rude.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.011
It's emphatic.

16:22.012 --> 16:24.453
Kyle Harrison had
adipocere on his pants leg.

16:24.454 --> 16:26.285
Adipo-what? It's an
organic substance

16:26.286 --> 16:28.287
formed by the anaerobic
bacterial hydrolysis

16:28.288 --> 16:30.119
of fatty tissue.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.220
Can we go back to texting?

16:31.221 --> 16:33.022
(Raised voice) Do I have
to speak in all capitals, too?

16:33.023 --> 16:34.323
(Normal voice)
He came in contact

16:34.324 --> 16:35.994
with a decomposing body.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.996
So maybe he came across
something he shouldn't have

16:37.997 --> 16:39.198
and was killed for it.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.030
Or maybe Kyle killed someone.

16:41.031 --> 16:42.531
He has been
living a secret life,

16:42.532 --> 16:44.503
lying to his wife, making
money god knows how.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.176
Plus, he's been hanging around
with sal rubenstone, an ex-con.

16:47.177 --> 16:48.637
Maybe, uh,

16:48.638 --> 16:51.480
losing his job turned
him to the dark side.

16:51.481 --> 16:53.512
This is interesting.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.683
What?

16:54.684 --> 16:56.085
I pulled Kyle's
employment history.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.416
He's never worked
for a moving company.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.587
He's been on unemployment.

16:58.588 --> 17:00.289
Wouldn't his wife
have seen the checks?

17:00.290 --> 17:01.620
She said all the bills got paid.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.122
He's having it sent
to another address...

17:03.123 --> 17:05.624
To the house of a woman
named Vanessa winters.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.128
Maybe that's where he's
been hiding out all day.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.230
Kyle was my ex-boyfriend.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.801
We dated in college,

17:12.802 --> 17:14.363
stayed friends.

17:14.364 --> 17:17.206
Why were his unemployment
checks coming here?

17:17.207 --> 17:18.807
Because he
couldn't tell his wife

17:18.808 --> 17:20.709
that he lost his job.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.711
Hmm. Why?

17:22.712 --> 17:25.374
Pride. He was always so retro,

17:25.375 --> 17:27.076
especially when
mindy got pregnant.

17:27.077 --> 17:29.748
You didn't like mindy
very much, did you?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.720
She didn't even know the
man that she was sleeping with.

17:31.721 --> 17:33.252
But you did, huh?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.184
You weren't just
a little bit jealous

17:35.185 --> 17:36.425
mindy got the
ring that you didn't?

17:36.426 --> 17:37.756
No way.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.159
We were friends. That's it.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.460
He was lying to his wife,

17:41.461 --> 17:43.192
sending his checks
to your house...

17:43.193 --> 17:45.494
That sounds like more
than friends to me.

17:45.495 --> 17:48.137
I let him use my
place as an office.

17:48.138 --> 17:51.170
Whenever he wasn't doing
some job for quick cash,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.672
he tried to get another
architect position.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.074
Well, I'm gonna need to come in,

17:56.075 --> 17:59.308
get any personal effects
that Kyle may have left behind.

17:59.309 --> 18:00.579
Don't you need
a warrant for that?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.451
Oh, I'd be happy to get one...

18:02.452 --> 18:04.583
If I need to.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.115
(People speaking indistinctly)

18:06.116 --> 18:08.487
Preliminary tox came back.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.359
Looks good for an
o.D. On your girl.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.361
I do trust you, you know?

18:12.362 --> 18:14.623
High-profile or no profile.

18:14.624 --> 18:17.166
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

18:17.167 --> 18:19.128
Look at this.

18:19.129 --> 18:21.200
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

18:21.201 --> 18:23.402
(Curtis) Damn. Check
out that skin lesion.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.103
Looks like purpura.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.104
Why would cocaine use

18:26.105 --> 18:28.106
cause somebody to
bleed under their skin?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.108
Because some drug dealers
have been cutting cocaine

18:30.109 --> 18:31.440
with levamisole,

18:31.441 --> 18:33.412
a drug used in
veterinary medicine.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.583
Mimics cocaine's high,

18:34.584 --> 18:36.415
but it also causes
tissue necrosis

18:36.416 --> 18:38.417
and lowered white blood
cell count in humans,

18:38.418 --> 18:40.449
which can make 'em
more prone to infection.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.151
Oh, man.

18:42.152 --> 18:43.452
And the batch
Gabrielle bought from

18:43.453 --> 18:44.853
must be all over Philly by now.

18:44.854 --> 18:46.195
(Sighs)

18:46.196 --> 18:48.658
There's no telling how
many more people could die.

18:53.463 --> 18:56.535
(People speaking indistinctly)

18:56.536 --> 18:59.808
So are you excited about
your big hot date tonight?

18:59.809 --> 19:01.139
What?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.641
You know, with the
strapping English bloke.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.812
I didn't know that you were

19:03.813 --> 19:05.143
into that whole
may-December thing.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.646
Oh, said the man
dallying with a teenager.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.718
And it's not a date,

19:09.719 --> 19:11.450
I only said that to
end the conversation.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.452
Really? Is that why you
almost chopped your arm off

19:13.453 --> 19:15.454
in the elevator door? (Sighs)

19:15.455 --> 19:17.456
I saw you, Megan.
You are so into this guy.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.458
Please tell me you have
a crime scene for me.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.460
Otherwise, you're
just here to annoy me.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.462
No crime scene, but
I did find some info

19:23.463 --> 19:26.265
on the substance that
you found in Kyle's teeth.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.896
And it wasn't food,

19:27.897 --> 19:30.339
it was a leaf from a cigar.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.571
That's strange. His wife
said he didn't smoke.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.804
So I had c.S.U. Run
a chemical analysis.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.376
The cigar that Kyle was smoking

19:37.377 --> 19:39.508
was infused with cognac.

19:39.509 --> 19:42.211
Mm. A Montecito especial.

19:42.212 --> 19:45.554
Todd got one of those from
his firm one year as a gift.

19:45.555 --> 19:47.316
Most expensive
cigar on the market...

19:47.317 --> 19:49.218
700 bucks a pop.

19:49.219 --> 19:50.819
There is no way that Kyle
could've afforded that. (Worker) Shh.

19:50.820 --> 19:52.821
For this reason that we
must issue a health warning.

19:52.822 --> 19:56.365
Ingestion of this cocaine,
even in small amounts,

19:56.366 --> 19:58.897
can cause infection
and possibly death.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.399
My office is working closely

20:00.400 --> 20:01.900
with the local branch of the
c.D.C. To track the source,

20:01.901 --> 20:04.503
but in the meantime, any
users who have noticed

20:04.504 --> 20:06.905
any purple or black
lesions on their skin

20:06.906 --> 20:09.207
should get to an emergency
room immediately.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.239
Thank you. (Reporters
shout indistinctly)

20:10.240 --> 20:11.580
(Man) Can you confirm
that the daughter

20:11.581 --> 20:12.911
of the Dean of Dexter university

20:12.912 --> 20:16.214
died from an overdose
of this cocaine?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.716
I have no comment. Thank you.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.917
(Reporters shout indistinctly)

20:18.918 --> 20:22.351
Teddy gorman.

20:22.352 --> 20:23.852
(Chuckles) Rough night?

20:23.853 --> 20:27.225
You woke me when you called.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.628
You know, that totally
sucks about Kyle.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.360
We found some files
on his computer...

20:31.361 --> 20:34.303
You know, architectural
drawings with your name on 'em.

20:34.304 --> 20:35.934
Was Kyle doing some
work for you? Yeah.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.707
He was. Uh, he designed
my remodel last year

20:38.708 --> 20:41.470
when he was working
at brand design.

20:41.471 --> 20:43.472
He called me, like,
three weeks ago,

20:43.473 --> 20:44.813
said he was working
freelance now.

20:44.814 --> 20:48.647
So I hired him to build
me a new guest house.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.878
(Sam) When was the
last time you saw him?

20:49.879 --> 20:51.249
I don't know.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.881
(Megan) That's
a nice cigar there.

20:52.882 --> 20:54.252
Montecito especial?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.424
Finest there is.

20:55.425 --> 20:56.855
Did you smoke one with Kyle?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.256
Actually, yeah. Yeah.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.989
To celebrate working
together again.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.891
Kyle had a leaf from
a Montecito especial

21:02.892 --> 21:04.433
in his teeth

21:04.434 --> 21:05.734
when he was murdered.

21:05.735 --> 21:08.298
Where'd the two
of you celebrate?

21:09.969 --> 21:11.700
Make yourself at home.

21:11.701 --> 21:13.772
Wow. Some room.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.604
Why don't we cut
the crap, Mr. Gorman?

21:15.605 --> 21:18.407
You saw Kyle two days
ago when he was here.

21:18.408 --> 21:20.949
(Sam) You were the last person
we know who saw him alive.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.852
(Teddy) So by that logic,
that makes me a murderer.

21:23.853 --> 21:25.654
(Megan) Teddy,

21:25.655 --> 21:27.756
do you know why cops

21:27.757 --> 21:29.888
light up cigars at crime scenes?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.590
(Mouths word)

21:31.591 --> 21:34.924
It's to cover the stench
of human decomposition.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.371
Is that why you
built this cigar room?

21:42.372 --> 21:43.902
Adipocere.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.435
What do you have
buried in this wall?

21:46.436 --> 21:48.808
(Pounding)

21:51.381 --> 21:54.844
Stop. Stop. Stop.

22:02.091 --> 22:04.554
Ugh.

22:15.665 --> 22:16.835
How the hell am I supposed
to know who she is?

22:16.836 --> 22:17.807
You having trouble
narrowing it down?

22:17.808 --> 22:18.967
How many women have you killed?

22:18.968 --> 22:20.439
Do you get off on this,

22:20.440 --> 22:21.740
when you're able to kick
back in your man cave

22:21.741 --> 22:23.772
while a dead woman
rots in the wall?

22:23.773 --> 22:24.943
No, hold on, okay...

22:24.944 --> 22:26.845
You take Kyle into
that cigar room,

22:26.846 --> 22:28.717
he notices the leaky wall,

22:28.718 --> 22:31.450
you kill him before he finds
the woman you strangled.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.651
Is that how it went down?

22:32.652 --> 22:33.782
Kyle was the one who wanted me

22:33.783 --> 22:35.123
to take him into that cigar room

22:35.124 --> 22:36.925
in the first place, okay?

22:36.926 --> 22:38.056
He said he wanted to
check out the design,

22:38.057 --> 22:39.888
see how it turned out.

22:39.889 --> 22:41.930
Oh, so you're saying that Kyle
knew the body was in there?

22:41.931 --> 22:43.462
Yes. No.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.893
I don't know.

22:44.894 --> 22:47.567
Well, maybe you can
find an answer in holding.

22:54.043 --> 22:55.804
Commissioner Travers,

22:55.805 --> 22:57.906
this is... a surprise.

22:57.907 --> 23:00.378
I don't like to mess
in the kitchen much

23:00.379 --> 23:02.781
unless one of the
pots starts to boil over.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.112
Did something happen?

23:04.113 --> 23:05.514
If you're unaware of it,

23:05.515 --> 23:06.815
then perhaps the
problems in your department

23:06.816 --> 23:08.887
are rooted deeper
than I imagined.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.058
Problems?

23:10.059 --> 23:11.920
Yes, problems.

23:11.921 --> 23:13.422
Let's see... under
budget, well-staffed,

23:13.423 --> 23:14.923
stellar reputation.

23:14.924 --> 23:16.795
Yeah, I-I guess I am unaware.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.968
(People speaking indistinctly)

23:19.969 --> 23:21.670
Oh. Antonio Diaz.

23:21.671 --> 23:23.001
That's right.

23:23.002 --> 23:26.404
I kept his daughter's name
out of the media as promised.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.736
I saw the press conference.

23:27.737 --> 23:29.407
When that reporter
asked about her...

23:29.408 --> 23:31.039
I said "no comment." You paused.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.581
Your body language...

23:32.582 --> 23:35.744
It was essentially a De
facto admission, Kate.

23:35.745 --> 23:37.045
All due respect, commissioner,

23:37.046 --> 23:39.187
I know that my
job is about politics

23:39.188 --> 23:40.819
and posturing.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.452
And I've already been forced
to compromise my integrity

23:43.453 --> 23:44.953
on more occasions,
quite frankly,

23:44.954 --> 23:46.094
than I'm comfortable with.

23:46.095 --> 23:47.826
So if you're looking
for me to apologize

23:47.827 --> 23:50.098
to your buddy Antonio
for what I didn't say,

23:50.099 --> 23:51.800
for my body language...

23:51.801 --> 23:53.161
That won't be necessary.

23:53.162 --> 23:56.004
I'm demoting you, Kate,

23:56.005 --> 23:57.836
effective immediately.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.538
You've gotta be kidding.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.471
No.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.914
(Scoffs)

24:05.915 --> 24:07.846
Well, someone
has to run this office,

24:07.847 --> 24:10.950
so have you given any
thought to who that might be?

24:19.859 --> 24:22.862
(People speaking indistinctly)

24:29.569 --> 24:31.199
Didn't expect to see you here.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.172
You really jumped on this case.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.074
Something going on?

24:36.075 --> 24:37.245
I used to specialize

24:37.246 --> 24:38.947
in forensic facial
reconstruction.

24:38.948 --> 24:40.078
I had an art background.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.780
Later, I got into the
whole anthropology thing,

24:41.781 --> 24:43.812
so it's kind of a
marriage of the two.

24:43.813 --> 24:45.514
Since we can't get
prints and her d.N.A.

24:45.515 --> 24:46.855
Is not in the system,
I thought maybe

24:46.856 --> 24:48.988
I could rebuild her
face and get an I.D.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.062
Uh, yeah,

24:54.063 --> 24:55.594
something is kinda happening.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.896
There you are. I never
asked for this, you know?

24:57.897 --> 24:59.898
I don't even know
if I wanna be chief.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.170
What are you talking about?

25:02.171 --> 25:04.733
Commissioner Travers demoted me.

25:04.734 --> 25:06.274
What?

25:06.275 --> 25:07.906
That's insane.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.007
No offense.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.610
Travers can kiss my ass.
Did you call the mayor?

25:11.611 --> 25:12.781
If not, I will.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.184
Kate, can we please
talk about this?

25:19.018 --> 25:21.249
There's a fingerprint
here on the plastic.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.922
I'll also have c.S.U. Run
her necklace for trace.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.523
You want to tell
me what happened?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.595
At least vent about it.

25:26.596 --> 25:27.996
Not right now. Just...

25:27.997 --> 25:29.998
My only concern right
now is this woman.

25:29.999 --> 25:31.830
I'll stay up all
night if I need to.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.932
Okay. I'm in.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.233
Oh, wait, no.
I've got that date.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.235
I mean the dinner thing.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.107
Oh, yeah? Who with?

25:39.108 --> 25:40.939
No, nobody. He's just a-a guy.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.170
I'll cancel.

25:42.171 --> 25:43.311
No, you won't.

25:43.312 --> 25:44.813
Yeah, I will. It's fine. No.

25:44.814 --> 25:45.974
Go.

25:45.975 --> 25:47.246
I got this.

25:59.889 --> 26:02.761
(People speaking indistinctly)

26:02.762 --> 26:06.134
This is your favorite
spot in the city?

26:06.135 --> 26:07.996
I can't believe you've
never been to Nick's before.

26:07.997 --> 26:10.298
Some would
consider that sacrilege.

26:10.299 --> 26:12.170
Not somebody who
actually likes to sit at a table

26:12.171 --> 26:14.072
when they eat.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.274
Oh, let me guess. You're
more of a salad type.

26:16.275 --> 26:19.107
Well, if you're a bit delicate
in the old stomach area,

26:19.108 --> 26:21.179
we could always, um...

26:21.180 --> 26:23.081
Have you ever heard
of rapunzel syndrome?

26:23.082 --> 26:24.783
Ra...

26:24.784 --> 26:26.655
It's an obsessive-compulsive
disorder where the person

26:26.656 --> 26:29.017
can't stop eating the
ends of their own hair.

26:29.018 --> 26:31.690
The only problem is,
the gastrointestinal tract

26:31.691 --> 26:33.591
is not capable of
digesting said hair,

26:33.592 --> 26:37.095
so it just kind of gathers
there in the intestine.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.727
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

26:38.728 --> 26:40.028
I once removed

26:40.029 --> 26:43.131
a 10-pound hairball
from an obstructed bowel

26:43.132 --> 26:45.934
of a corpse in an autopsy.

26:45.935 --> 26:47.105
(Coughs)

26:47.106 --> 26:48.737
Bon appetit.

26:48.738 --> 26:50.739
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

26:50.740 --> 26:52.140
Well played. Mm.

26:52.141 --> 26:53.682
You, um, you bust that one out

26:53.683 --> 26:55.013
on all your first dates?

26:55.014 --> 26:58.016
(Mouth full) You, uh, ply
all of yours with cholesterol?

26:58.017 --> 26:59.187
(Laughs)

26:59.188 --> 27:00.719
(Chuckles)

27:00.720 --> 27:02.721
Okay. Gloves are off then.

27:02.722 --> 27:03.892
Mm.

27:03.893 --> 27:07.195
When did you get divorced?

27:07.196 --> 27:09.097
Um...

27:09.098 --> 27:10.759
Couple months
after you put that pool

27:10.760 --> 27:12.861
in the backyard of my old house.

27:12.862 --> 27:15.834
I never did get to enjoy
the fruits of your labor.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.165
Yeah, I'm sorry to say,

27:17.166 --> 27:19.668
I kind of saw the writing
on the wall with that one.

27:19.669 --> 27:20.839
(Normal voice) Oh, did you?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.010
Yeah.

27:22.011 --> 27:23.141
You see, I work
with a lot of couples,

27:23.142 --> 27:24.743
and, um...

27:24.744 --> 27:27.145
You can tell a lot
about a marriage

27:27.146 --> 27:28.646
by the decision-making process.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.118
And you and your husband,

27:30.119 --> 27:31.750
you couldn't agree on one thing.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.052
(Chuckles) Yeah, but I always
got what I wanted, didn't I?

27:34.053 --> 27:35.183
I definitely liked the fact

27:35.184 --> 27:37.185
that you were willing
to take chances.

27:37.186 --> 27:39.127
Kinda like this.

27:39.128 --> 27:42.761
Thank god I have my
cardiologist on speed dial.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.865
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

27:50.069 --> 27:51.669
(Chuckles)

27:51.670 --> 27:53.141
Why did you do that?

27:53.142 --> 27:54.744
Do what?

28:02.111 --> 28:04.854
(Chuckles)

Yeah.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.876
(Sighs)

29:37.877 --> 29:40.248
You know, when
I lost my last job,

29:40.249 --> 29:41.950
I was a textbook case

29:41.951 --> 29:43.912
of kubler-Ross'
five stages of grief.

29:43.913 --> 29:45.914
She was talking about
grieving over a death.

29:45.915 --> 29:47.956
Well, losing a job

29:47.957 --> 29:49.317
is like losing someone you love.

29:49.318 --> 29:50.859
Think about it.

29:50.860 --> 29:51.990
There's a lot
wrapped up in it...

29:51.991 --> 29:54.562
Your sense of
identity, your self-worth.

29:54.563 --> 29:55.894
Look at Kyle Harrison.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.966
He lost his job, his life
went right off the rails.

29:57.967 --> 29:59.868
Great. Thank you.
You know what I mean.

29:59.869 --> 30:02.070
I'm here if you want to talk.

30:02.071 --> 30:04.102
Thank you, but I'm fine.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.403
No, you're not.
You're in denial.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.105
Megan... oh, there's
anger. Look at you.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.406
You're just sailing
right through them.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.979
(Chuckles)

30:10.980 --> 30:12.280
Okay, fine. What's next?

30:12.281 --> 30:14.412
Getting her image out there,

30:14.413 --> 30:16.845
to the news, the
police, the Internet.

30:16.846 --> 30:19.347
That's it. The Internet.

30:19.348 --> 30:21.089
Everyone's life

30:21.090 --> 30:22.590
is online now,

30:22.591 --> 30:25.823
hopefully including
our prime suspect.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.997
(Clicks keyboard keys)

30:28.998 --> 30:31.159
Ah. Voila. Teddy gorman.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.031
(Clicks mouse)

30:33.032 --> 30:34.904
(Click)

30:36.135 --> 30:39.007
(Click)

30:39.008 --> 30:40.940
Oh, stop.

30:44.473 --> 30:46.014
(Click)

30:46.015 --> 30:48.977
(Kate) Her name's Lisa.

30:48.978 --> 30:50.278
(Sam) Lisa schmidt.

30:50.279 --> 30:51.980
She was the girl in your wall.

30:51.981 --> 30:53.221
Didn't know her, huh?

30:53.222 --> 30:54.953
You two look pretty cozy to me.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.885
Oh, they were more
than cozy, right, Teddy?

30:56.886 --> 30:59.227
According to your
friends, she lived with you.

30:59.228 --> 31:00.989
We met at a club, okay?

31:00.990 --> 31:02.991
We started dating, and
then after a couple of weeks,

31:02.992 --> 31:04.332
she asked to move in.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.034
I... she said she
didn't have any family

31:06.035 --> 31:07.265
or anywhere else to go.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.967
So how was that relationship?

31:08.968 --> 31:11.069
I-I-It was wild. It was intense.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.371
She was like a-a tornado.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.573
Relationships like that
tend to have a body count.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.105
I didn't kill her!

31:17.106 --> 31:18.576
Then how the hell did
she end up in your wall?!

31:18.577 --> 31:20.108
I don't know, man!

31:20.109 --> 31:23.011
Look, all I know is,
is between her drama

31:23.012 --> 31:24.382
a-and the construction
of the house,

31:24.383 --> 31:26.054
I-I just needed some air.

31:26.055 --> 31:27.555
Okay? So I took off to Vegas.

31:27.556 --> 31:29.958
A-And when I got
back, she was gone.

31:29.959 --> 31:32.660
And you know what?
I was okay with that.

31:32.661 --> 31:35.423
I'm sure you were.

31:35.424 --> 31:37.125
(Humming and crunching)

31:37.126 --> 31:38.626
(Footsteps approach)

31:38.627 --> 31:40.468
What do you think you doing?

31:40.469 --> 31:42.630
This ain't no time to
feed your face, fool.

31:42.631 --> 31:44.172
I just heard from
detective Morris.

31:44.173 --> 31:45.673
Teddy gorman's not confessing.

31:45.674 --> 31:47.005
They need hard evidence,

31:47.006 --> 31:49.007
and I don't want my
department to drop the ball.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.138
"My department"?

31:50.139 --> 31:52.580
Wow. Listen to you.

31:52.581 --> 31:56.084
I can terminate your
fellowship just like that.

31:56.085 --> 31:57.445
What? You wouldn't do that.

31:57.446 --> 31:59.447
I... I'm the peanut
butter to your jelly,

31:59.448 --> 32:01.089
the hall to your oates...

32:01.090 --> 32:03.351
And the pimple on my behind.

32:03.352 --> 32:05.923
I just got handed my
first two cases as chief,

32:05.924 --> 32:07.925
and I'll be damned if they
don't get closed pronto.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.927
You feel me?

32:09.928 --> 32:13.101
(Indistinct conversations)

32:13.102 --> 32:14.232
(Morris) Look at that.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.034
The face of a liar.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.166
Your fingerprint was
on plastic sheeting

32:18.167 --> 32:20.138
wrapped around a
murder victim, sal...

32:20.139 --> 32:21.409
Lisa schmidt.

32:21.410 --> 32:22.570
Lisa who?

32:22.571 --> 32:24.342
(Sam) Teddy gorman's girlfriend.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.513
You were the
construction foreman

32:25.514 --> 32:27.145
on his remodel last year.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.276
Oh, yeah.

32:28.277 --> 32:29.947
Yeah, wait a minute.
I remember her.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.619
(Laughs and snorts)

32:31.620 --> 32:33.121
She used to lounge
out by the pool,

32:33.122 --> 32:35.053
get my guys all riled up.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.985
But not you, right?

32:36.986 --> 32:39.027
Oh, she was wicked hot. It
doesn't mean I acted on it.

32:39.028 --> 32:41.459
You know how to build
a wall... drywall, plaster?

32:41.460 --> 32:42.960
Yeah, of course.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.263
How are you with strangulation?

32:45.264 --> 32:46.594
You choked Lisa to death,

32:46.595 --> 32:48.196
and then you buried
her in that wall.

32:48.197 --> 32:51.439
Kyle found out about it, you
had to take care of him, too.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.571
(Sam) Look, you got
anger issues, a rap sheet,

32:53.572 --> 32:55.303
means, and motive.

32:55.304 --> 32:57.075
Not the best combination, sal.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.577
You want to talk to us?

33:00.409 --> 33:02.210
I want a lawyer.

33:02.211 --> 33:04.083
(Morris sighs)

33:05.414 --> 33:07.085
Come on.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.588
Get him outta here.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.692
Well, we can't
prove sal killed Lisa

33:14.693 --> 33:16.494
with just a
fingerprint on plastic.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.126
He worked the site.

33:18.127 --> 33:19.497
His paws would've
been all over it.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.769
Then we've got to connect
him to Kyle's murder.

33:21.770 --> 33:24.702
If we do, maybe we can get
him on circumstantial with Lisa's.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.104
Yeah.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.076
Excuse me. Am I
interrupting something?

33:28.077 --> 33:29.637
When aren't you?

33:29.638 --> 33:31.579
Oh, just thought
you'd like to know...

33:31.580 --> 33:34.113
I found the crime scene.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.018
This is the rock

33:41.019 --> 33:42.390
that we found in the bullet
that killed Kyle Harrison.

33:42.391 --> 33:44.792
It's got yellow paint
on one side of it.

33:44.793 --> 33:46.154
Now to the naked eye,

33:46.155 --> 33:47.325
it looks like
reflective street paint,

33:47.326 --> 33:48.496
but microscopy revealed

33:48.497 --> 33:49.627
that the paint actually
has two layers.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.159
The bottom layer

33:51.160 --> 33:52.700
is a consumer-grade
yellow spray paint,

33:52.701 --> 33:54.702
and the top is a
protective coating

33:54.703 --> 33:57.105
used to preserve
the yellow paint.

33:57.106 --> 33:59.107
Kyle was supposedly lying on
the ground when he was shot.

33:59.108 --> 34:01.569
Why would there be yellow spray
paint on the ground? Forget that.

34:01.570 --> 34:03.571
What if he was shot
standing against a wall?

34:03.572 --> 34:05.413
His wound would still be shored.

34:05.414 --> 34:06.644
Like graffiti?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.146
Most likely, but
why would the graffiti

34:08.147 --> 34:09.317
have a protective coating?

34:09.318 --> 34:10.648
(Sam) I know why.

34:10.649 --> 34:11.779
The mural arts program.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.621
It's been around since the '80s.

34:13.622 --> 34:14.752
The city was
trying to find a way

34:14.753 --> 34:16.684
to get graffiti artists
away from vandalism

34:16.685 --> 34:18.656
and into painting murals.

34:18.657 --> 34:19.827
That's why it's protected.

34:19.828 --> 34:21.759
Those murals
are all over Philly.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.332
So you just cross-reference
Joey jablonsky's stops

34:24.333 --> 34:26.334
with the location of the
murals, and you got it.

34:26.335 --> 34:28.736
Jeez. Do I have
to do everything?

34:28.737 --> 34:32.671
♪♪♪

34:58.197 --> 34:59.727
At last!

34:59.728 --> 35:01.470
We have our crime scene.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.773
Here.

35:05.774 --> 35:07.876
Okay.

35:32.901 --> 35:35.233
(Morris) We meet
again, Mr. Brand.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.404
I gotta say,

35:36.405 --> 35:38.436
I did not peg you as a killer

35:38.437 --> 35:39.737
or a sexual deviant.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.709
Well, I can assure
you, I'm neither.

35:41.710 --> 35:43.771
Sexual assault in
'06 sound familiar?

35:43.772 --> 35:45.213
That charge was dropped.

35:45.214 --> 35:46.544
It was some opportunistic intern

35:46.545 --> 35:47.815
trying to get a payday.

35:47.816 --> 35:50.147
Well, regardless, it put
your d.N.A. In the system.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.149
And we matched
that with a profile

35:52.150 --> 35:54.182
at Kyle Harrison's murder scene.

35:54.183 --> 35:56.184
Your skin cells transferred
on to the bullet casings

35:56.185 --> 35:58.256
when you loaded the gun, Harvey.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.757
See, we know you did it.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.331
The only question is why.

36:03.932 --> 36:05.863
So there you were,

36:05.864 --> 36:07.365
Teddy gorman's house last year,

36:07.366 --> 36:10.398
day after day,
with that hot babe

36:10.399 --> 36:11.699
Lisa schmidt

36:11.700 --> 36:14.872
taunting you in a
bikini by the pool.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.405
Gorman goes out of town.

36:17.406 --> 36:18.706
You hit on her.

36:18.707 --> 36:21.809
She turns you down
flat, and you lose it.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.711
She winds up dead.

36:23.712 --> 36:25.783
Now me? I'd have panicked.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.215
But not you.

36:27.216 --> 36:28.716
You Bury her in that cigar wall,

36:28.717 --> 36:31.559
collect all of her belongings.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.221
Tramp like that,

36:33.222 --> 36:34.922
outta sight, outta mind, right?

36:34.923 --> 36:37.865
(Sam) So you fire everyone
involved with the job...

36:37.866 --> 36:39.427
Kyle, sal,

36:39.428 --> 36:42.199
anyone who could
discover what you did.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.201
Now when Kyle found
that crack in the wall,

36:44.202 --> 36:45.303
did he call you?

36:45.304 --> 36:46.974
Look, it's true.

36:46.975 --> 36:48.906
We met.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.339
He pulled a gun on me.

36:51.340 --> 36:54.812
Said I'd ruined his
life when I fired him.

36:54.813 --> 36:58.346
There was a struggle,
the gun went off. I...

36:58.347 --> 36:59.847
It was self-defense.

36:59.848 --> 37:02.350
As for this girl,

37:02.351 --> 37:04.322
I mean, you can't
pin that on me.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.823
(Cell phone rings)

37:05.824 --> 37:07.955
Right. So this is all

37:07.956 --> 37:09.757
in your brain...

37:09.758 --> 37:10.928
Megan hunt.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.860
(Kate) Hey, it's me.

37:12.861 --> 37:15.663
C.s.u. Found a small hair
caught in Lisa schmidt's necklace,

37:15.664 --> 37:16.834
and get this...

37:16.835 --> 37:19.937
The shaft was perforated by
trichophyton mentagrophytes.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.370
Really? That's ringworm.
More specifically,

37:22.371 --> 37:24.842
from the looks of the
hair shaft, tinea barbae.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.814
Huh.

37:26.815 --> 37:28.476
You don't say?

37:28.477 --> 37:30.318
(Sam speaks indistinctly)

37:30.319 --> 37:31.879
(Morris speaks indistinctly)

37:31.880 --> 37:34.922
(Morris) Let's talk about
this self-defense story.

37:34.923 --> 37:36.724
(Door closes)

37:36.725 --> 37:37.885
So you didn't kill her?

37:37.886 --> 37:41.659
Because whoever did
left a hair in her necklace.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.592
And that person had ringworm.

37:44.593 --> 37:47.795
And the interesting
thing about ringworm is,

37:47.796 --> 37:50.638
if it's not caught right away,

37:50.639 --> 37:52.671
it causes scarring.

37:54.002 --> 37:55.373
What are you doing?!

37:55.374 --> 37:56.704
Proving that you killed Lisa!

37:56.705 --> 37:58.906
The killer had
fungus in his beard,

37:58.907 --> 38:01.680
and you still have a scar.

38:03.652 --> 38:04.952
(Handcuffs rattle)

38:04.953 --> 38:06.854
(Chair scrapes floor)

38:06.855 --> 38:08.816
(Scrape)

38:08.817 --> 38:10.958
Detective Morris is correct.

38:10.959 --> 38:14.592
Kyle contacted you when
he saw that leak in the wall.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.964
And because he's a good worker,

38:16.965 --> 38:19.867
you knew that he'd
tear it down and fix it.

38:19.868 --> 38:21.369
(Sam) So you shot him
underneath that bridge

38:21.370 --> 38:24.301
and dumped him in the first
open trunk you could find.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.904
First you fire Kyle

38:26.905 --> 38:28.836
to cover up what you did,

38:28.837 --> 38:31.509
and then you kill him,

38:31.510 --> 38:33.010
leaving his wife a widow

38:33.011 --> 38:34.912
and his unborn
child without a father.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.885
And all because a young girl

38:37.886 --> 38:40.048
just didn't want to screw you.

38:44.092 --> 38:46.994
Thank you for
coming by, Dr. Hunt,

38:46.995 --> 38:49.627
for telling me what happened.

38:49.628 --> 38:52.530
I'm just sorry I couldn't
change the outcome.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.863
But I thought you might
find some solace in knowing.

38:55.864 --> 38:58.005
I also...

38:58.006 --> 39:00.067
Wanted to give you this.

39:00.068 --> 39:04.612
When the police were going
through Kyle's computer,

39:04.613 --> 39:06.814
they found this letter.

39:06.815 --> 39:10.479
Your husband was the
man you thought he was.

39:13.382 --> 39:15.984
You take care of that baby.

39:17.085 --> 39:18.456
(Door opens)

39:18.457 --> 39:21.459

40:23.592 --> 40:25.553
Oh, hello, dear.

40:25.554 --> 40:27.655
How was it? What
did I miss? Wow.

40:27.656 --> 40:29.727
Grandma said it was
the city that never sleeps,

40:29.728 --> 40:32.059
and then we proved it.

40:32.060 --> 40:35.032
Yes, well, grandma has never
lacked for stamina, has she?

40:35.033 --> 40:37.805
Well, like you stopped working
all weekend, even for a second?

40:37.806 --> 40:39.467
Well, no.

40:39.468 --> 40:42.209
Except there was this one thing.

40:42.210 --> 40:46.213
Something really creepy
happened on Friday.

40:46.214 --> 40:48.816
This guy came into the office,

40:48.817 --> 40:51.118
and he pretended
that he knew me.

40:51.119 --> 40:53.621
He was like some weird stalker.

40:53.622 --> 40:56.183
He said that we had
been talking online,

40:56.184 --> 40:57.955
that we were supposed
to have dinner.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.057
Really?

41:00.058 --> 41:01.959
That's terrible.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.090
I know.

41:03.091 --> 41:05.733
And Peter... he tried
to get him to back off,

41:05.734 --> 41:08.195
and he wouldn't, and then all
of a sudden, fists were flying,

41:08.196 --> 41:10.237
and... and thank
god bud was there,

41:10.238 --> 41:11.739
because he just tackled him

41:11.740 --> 41:13.140
and then put him in handcuffs,

41:13.141 --> 41:16.844
and he carted him away.

41:16.845 --> 41:19.247
(Clears throat)

41:20.609 --> 41:23.611
You gotta be kidding
me. Both of you?

41:23.612 --> 41:26.153
Her I can believe, but you?

41:26.154 --> 41:27.055
I-I didn't want to.

41:27.056 --> 41:28.956
She... she made me. Oh.

41:28.957 --> 41:30.818
Mother. Megan,
so it didn't happen?

41:30.819 --> 41:33.260
No, but it could have.
What were you thinking?

41:33.261 --> 41:34.962
Well, what do you
think I was thinking?

41:34.963 --> 41:36.924
I want you to
have a social life.

41:36.925 --> 41:38.095
Oh, my god.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.096
(Sighs)

41:43.271 --> 41:46.074
Well, if you must know...

41:47.505 --> 41:49.577
I did meet up with him.

41:49.578 --> 41:51.680
And we had dinner.

41:53.842 --> 41:55.042
So?

41:55.043 --> 41:58.046
So... okay. Mm.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.719
Look at you.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.792
It was more than
okay, wasn't it?

42:04.793 --> 42:06.624
Maybe. (Laughs)

42:06.625 --> 42:08.056
(Laughs)

42:10.058 --> 42:12.000
Mm.
