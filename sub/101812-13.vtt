gonna make it that far.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.834
Can you even get this heap
of scrap metal running?

11:44.878 --> 11:46.183

11:46.227 --> 11:48.882

because Matty feels guilty

And the one thing
you two have in common

18:41.729 --> 18:42.991
is those nano-trackers.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.297
How can that be?

18:44.340 --> 18:45.994
We made sure that
the nano-trackers were inert

when we got the sunset
sequence from Silas.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.610
The nano-trackers are inert,

18:53.654 --> 18:55.090
but they are foreign
nanoparticles in the blood,

18:55.134 --> 18:57.745

physiological side effect.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.138
All right,
what does that mean exactly?

18:59.181 --> 19:00.835

have been forming

kind of like cholesterol.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.100

seems to be localized

just became "Project Urgent."

and why.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.248

20:09.686 --> 20:11.819
but these are some seriously
skilled computer hackers.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.560

code to them

20:13.603 --> 20:15.475
and create a program
to watch the broker

20:15.518 --> 20:17.259

keystroke analytics

by the time we land in Italy.

20:18.739 --> 20:19.957
Are you really proposing

20:20.001 --> 20:21.655

in classified ops?

20:21.698 --> 20:23.091
Well, yes.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.398
But we could chop up the code
into discreet sub-tasks

20:25.441 --> 20:26.834
so they can't see
the whole program.
