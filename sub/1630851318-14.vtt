WEBVTT

00:04.905 --> 00:07.608
Morgan's meatballs?
Garlic.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.777
Lim's brownies.
Walnuts.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.345
Okay, you can't
have an empty plate
the whole time,

00:11.479 --> 00:12.646
because it is
kind of rude.

00:12.780 --> 00:16.184
Wouldn't it be ruder
to take food
and not eat it?

00:18.686 --> 00:19.953
Your recliner
does not go with

00:20.088 --> 00:21.822
any of the other furniture
in the living room.

00:21.955 --> 00:25.393
It's older and, you know,
a little worn in.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.528
Which is why I like it.
It's unique.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.398
I do, too, and it's
super comfortable,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.133
which is why it'll
go great in the den.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.334
Upstairs.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.471
Fair enough.
Mm-hmm.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.474
Ooh. Loading up
for an ultra-marathon?

00:40.608 --> 00:42.643
Figured I'd better try
everyone's contributions.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.578
Your brownies
were great.
Well, thank you.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.380
I should be the one
carbo loading,

00:46.514 --> 00:48.015
seeing as half
my department's
in New York

00:48.149 --> 00:49.650
for the next three days.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.386
Those conferences raise
the hospital's profile,

00:52.520 --> 00:54.255
as well as
your department's.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.326
That has mayonnaise.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.828
You don't have to eat it.

01:00.961 --> 01:04.832
Just move some to a napkin
every few minutes,

01:04.965 --> 01:07.235
then just...

01:09.903 --> 01:11.505
Hm.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.242
I am going to need
a lot of napkins.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.411
Hm.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.780
Oh. Or none at all.
I have to go.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.054
Jake Khan, 32.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.522
Cut off his big toe
while camping.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.658
Chopping wood
is very dangerous.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.460
My neighbor in Wyoming
nearly died

01:32.593 --> 01:34.495
after hitting his foot
with an axe.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.497
It wasn't an axe,
it was a machete.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.898
She wasn't
chopping wood.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.633
I woke up,
and the tent was dark.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.936
I thought I saw a snake,
but it was his foot.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.405
Do you normally
wear glasses?

01:48.376 --> 01:50.110
I retract that question.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.646
Can you reattach it?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.882
Your machete
was very sharp.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.116
So yes.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.355
Your sweet potato casserole
was a runaway hit.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.557
It was gone
before I got any.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.893
You should have had some
back at the apartment
when you had the chance.

02:06.026 --> 02:09.763
I got distracted,
which I seem to remember
was your fault.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.966
You busy this weekend?

02:13.100 --> 02:14.902
Actually, a few of
my college buddies
are in town.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.670
Well, I'd love
to hear all about

02:16.804 --> 02:18.939
my boyfriend's
frat house exploits.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.141
I think they kind of
just want to catch up
with me.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.276
Maybe next time?

02:23.110 --> 02:24.712
Yeah. Totally.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.946
Next time.

02:29.049 --> 02:32.152
Digital nerve
is fully re-attached.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.487
Check
for distal pulses.

02:35.423 --> 02:38.091
Add this
to the list of reasons
I don't go camping.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.561
Right after ticks,
bears, and giardia.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.163
Lea loves bears.
She thinks they're cute.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.466
A grizzly bear can crush
a bowling ball with its bite.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.502
I watch a lot
of Discovery.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.770
Pulse present.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.339
Color and capillary refill
look good.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.873
It's well-perfused.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.242
Good. Let's...

02:57.278 --> 03:00.514
Dr. Lim, are you okay?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.983
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a little bit
too much at the potluck.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.518
All good.
Let's finish up here.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.488
Let's just place
a dress...ing.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.532
Step away.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.602
Very slowly.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.205
Why?

03:27.675 --> 03:31.345
C-Can't you see
the snake right...there?

03:33.581 --> 03:34.982
T-There is no snake.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.618
Dr. Lim, I think
you should step out.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.074
Whoa!

04:03.143 --> 04:05.212
How are you feeling?
Any nausea? Dizziness?

04:05.346 --> 04:06.947
No. What is happening?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.449
Everyone here
was at the potluck.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.918
Has to be
some sort of toxin
or food poisoning.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.421
Dr. Lim's symptoms
don't seem like
typical food poisoning.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.788
How many people are...

04:16.390 --> 04:18.225
Shaunie!
Oh.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.393
I missed ya.
Okay.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.362
Fourteen, including her.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.366
I'm cool, right?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.901
Like, if you were hanging out
with a bunch of friends,
like, you'd want me to come?

04:28.035 --> 04:30.704
Totally. You're the coolest.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.006
Add insecure blabbering
to the list of symptoms.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.408
Start an IV,
get him on some fluids.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.778
Put me down!

04:37.911 --> 04:39.647
You know what I love
about you?
Oh, no.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.081
You look like
a Disney princess.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.916
But you're mean.
And that's so...

04:45.586 --> 04:46.754
...hot.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.921
I love you.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.090
Uh, I love you, too.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.360
That's why we need to talk
about my recliner.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.927
You can't hide it
in the den.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.763
It's living room
or bust.

04:55.896 --> 04:59.333
Okay, let's find you
a nice place to lie down.

04:59.467 --> 05:04.071
Are you experiencing nausea,
confusion, or hallucinations?

05:04.204 --> 05:05.305
No.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.740
I'm great.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.910
Oh.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.946
Almost as great
as your hair.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.915
Oh.
Temperature's elevated.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.751
And you're using
the same voice you use

05:17.885 --> 05:19.487
to talk to
our neighbor's dog.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.554
Oh. How do you do that?

05:20.688 --> 05:21.789
Conditioner?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.491
Genetics?

05:23.624 --> 05:25.759
Pupils dilated.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.765
Waiting room
is utter pandemonium.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.968
We have an ETA on surgeons
returning from the conference?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.470
There's a huge storm
in New York.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.805
Flights are grounded
till tomorrow.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.507
We can't send anyone home
till we know for sure

05:39.640 --> 05:40.908
what we're dealing with.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.275
Let's keep them in the E.R.
and watch for any renal,

05:42.410 --> 05:43.744
hepatic, or neurological
complications.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.946
There aren't enough bays
in the E.R.

05:46.079 --> 05:50.317
to babysit a sick staff
and also take in new patients.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.720
We could use the private E.R.
bays for the sicker staff,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.622
then use a conference room
for overflow.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.923
The residents'
break room is better.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.190
Has a sink and no carpet.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.159
It's vomit-ready.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.728
Prep the break room,
and then start figuring out

06:00.861 --> 06:02.362
exactly what everyone ate.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.197
Document any commonalities.
I'll loop in Dr. Allen.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.666
The four of us will run point

06:05.799 --> 06:07.367
on any surgical and E.R...

06:10.471 --> 06:11.805
Dr. Andrews?

06:12.540 --> 06:13.941
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.584
And then
there were three.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.770
I know
it's a little crazy
out there right now,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.438
but in here,
it's just like
any other day.

06:44.572 --> 06:47.340
Mr. Hoyt here
fractured his skull

06:47.475 --> 06:48.676
while trying
to fix his roof,

06:48.809 --> 06:51.044
and now we are going
to try and fix him.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.713
Dr. Murphy, help me
mark up the patient,

06:52.846 --> 06:54.682
and let's crack him open.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.150
I think you mean mark
the trauma flap

06:57.284 --> 06:58.719
for the craniotomy?

06:59.487 --> 07:00.521
Sure.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.425
Who played Olympic Hills
last week?

07:05.559 --> 07:07.060
Was that you?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.362
Put two balls in the pond
off the first tee.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.465
Went downhill from there.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.867
I know that pond,
and I hate that pond.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.806
You know
the pot bunker on 18?

07:18.939 --> 07:21.609
Dr. Glassman,
the CT scans show

07:21.742 --> 07:23.376
skull fragments are putting
pressure on the brain.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.878
We need to go faster.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.616
Four times,
I hit the lip.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.718
Four times, the ball rolled
right back to my feet.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.186
Scalpel.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.901
I feel...

07:49.402 --> 07:50.838
Floaty.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.272
Should I get a doctor?

07:52.405 --> 07:53.574
No, it's nice.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.113
The snakes
still in your bed?

08:01.381 --> 08:02.115
No.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.918
I think they're sleeping.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.258
Oh.

08:11.391 --> 08:15.162
Your pink sweater
is...amazing.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.266
And swirly.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.001
So swirly.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.504
It's a good thing

08:24.638 --> 08:28.275
you sent a chunk
of the department
to that conference.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.610
Not that you asked me.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.779
I'm head of the hospital.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.446
Like I could ever
forget that.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.348
There it is.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.951
That classic Audrey Lim

08:38.085 --> 08:40.253
passive aggressive
pushback.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.924
Whatever was in the food

08:44.057 --> 08:47.227
seems to have lowered
your inhibitions, so...
Okay. Good.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.830
You want me to be
less passive aggressive?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.431
Yes, I would.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.967
Okay.
Okay.

08:57.571 --> 09:01.208
All that talk about how much
you care about the hospital?

09:03.110 --> 09:04.377
I don't buy it.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.052
You love
being the president.

09:12.185 --> 09:15.255
Yes, you do.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.959
And all that power
and attention

09:19.092 --> 09:21.629
just feeds
your ginormous ego.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.396
Oh, that's rich,

09:23.530 --> 09:25.332
coming from
the control freak

09:25.465 --> 09:29.369
who keeps just enough chaos
in her life to feel cool.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.606
This whole maverick,
daredevil schtick?

09:32.740 --> 09:36.009
I'm so over it.
Aren't you over it?

09:36.143 --> 09:37.845
You know
what I'm over?

09:39.146 --> 09:40.513
Your skin-tight clothes.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.418
Yeah, we get it.
You're in great shape.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.353
Excuse me,
maybe you two should...

09:46.486 --> 09:47.788
For your age.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.389
I work out.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.758
We know.

09:50.891 --> 09:54.227
...stop talking
about anything.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.569
The cranioplasty
took seven minutes longer
than it should have.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.873
I'm okay with that,
as long as we have
a smooth surgery.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.075
But with all the cases
we have...

10:08.208 --> 10:10.543
Shaun, you're in the O.R.
You're a leader. Okay?

10:10.678 --> 10:12.946
When people are stressed,
that's when mistakes happen.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.749
How does pretending
a stressful situation
isn't stressful

10:15.883 --> 10:17.317
make it less stressful?

10:17.450 --> 10:18.652
Dr. Glassman?
Bay seven is waiting.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.756
Keep the morale up,
keep the tension down.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.864
Do you remember what you ate
from the potluck?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.365
Your hair's emitting...

10:33.901 --> 10:35.068
A glow.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.706
Probably because
it's on fire.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.047
Let's move you
to a quiet area.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.082
This is so not
the worst trip
I've been on.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.285
I work in tech.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.922
You've been to one
micro-dosing session
in the Redwoods,

10:55.055 --> 10:56.857
you've been to
all of them.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.158
Please answer
my questions.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.827
I need to
pinpoint what dish
is affecting everyone.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.594
Oh, good idea.
I wanna help.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.798
You are way too high
for that.
Ooh. Oh, yeah?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.599
I ate Skarlen's cake,

11:06.734 --> 11:07.901
which definitely had
too much nutmeg,

11:08.035 --> 11:09.602
which can be
a hallucinogenic.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.438
But she didn't make enough
to affect everyone.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.107
I also ate
Giacomin's sandwiches,
which were on rye.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.977
Moldy rye supposedly
caused the hysteria
at the Salem Witch Trials,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.779
which I doubt
everyone ate them,

11:18.912 --> 11:21.548
because they were
terrible.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.251
So dry.

11:24.384 --> 11:28.321
But given what I am feeling,
uh, my expert opinion,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.557
we're in the neighborhood
of LSD, mescaline.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.862
Start asking people
questions.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.196
Mm. 'Kay.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.467
Irrigate into
the incision site.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.003
Does my urging you to move
quickly make you tense?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.972
No. I can handle it.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.874
Dr. Glassman thinks
the O.R. staff can't,

11:47.007 --> 11:48.308
which is why
he works too slowly.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.677
And uses
wrong terminology.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.145
Hope you didn't
tell him that.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.081
I did.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.950
He is normally open
to my opinions.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.919
We have known each other
a long time.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.922
Uh, I know, Shaun,
but he's a senior surgeon,

12:02.055 --> 12:03.290
and you're still
a resident.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.793
You can't expect for him
to adjust to your pace.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.862
You can run things
the way you want

12:08.996 --> 12:11.198
when you're
the senior doctor.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.768
So, if I'm not working
with Dr. Glassman

12:14.902 --> 12:17.537
and I am the senior doctor,
I can run things how I want.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.240
That's not exactly
what I meant.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.542
More patients.
I need to go.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.877
Close him up
and run an EKG,

12:24.011 --> 12:25.178
and thank you
for the helpful advice.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.185
No deep lacerations.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.389
You done? I have to
work in the morning.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.191
You should take
the day off.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.793
Give yourself
a chance to heal.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.228
No, I need the hours.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.830
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.298
Dr. Glassman,
there is a patient
in bay two.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.566
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

12:46.699 --> 12:47.968
Just, uh, sit.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.907
What kind of work
do you do, Cameron?

12:59.079 --> 13:00.948
How severe
is the rectal pain?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.215
I can barely sit down.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.583
Any history
of rectal fissures,

13:03.716 --> 13:05.385
inflammatory bowel disease,
or hemorrhoids?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.519
I don't think so.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.988
Dr. Murphy,
what was that last part?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.923
Hemorrhoids. We are very busy.
You need to write faster.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.225
Have you recently
inserted a foreign object
into your rectum?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.663
Please answer.
I am trying to help you,

13:16.796 --> 13:18.832
but also, I do not want
to spend any longer
than necessary.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.068
It was a toothbrush.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.639
I was...bored.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.978
Second degree
electrical burn.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.913
Were you touching
anything else
when you got shocked?

13:33.046 --> 13:34.147
I don't think so.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.086
Burn ointment,
morphine for debridement,
maintenance fluids.

13:39.219 --> 13:42.189
I asked for lactated ringers
with D-5 saline, not D-10.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.256
I'm sorry.
You were going so fast.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.457
No, thank you.
I will get it myself.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.829
I imagine with the pay cuts
and the new hires,

13:49.963 --> 13:51.631
there's a lot of pressure
at work, huh?

13:51.764 --> 13:53.833
Yeah. My wife
already lost her job,

13:53.967 --> 13:55.535
and I can't afford
to lose mine, too.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.305
Are you sleeping?

14:00.307 --> 14:01.574
Um...

14:04.978 --> 14:06.146
What about the bean dip?

14:06.279 --> 14:07.814
I don't think
I had any of that.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.149
Hm.

14:09.749 --> 14:10.783
Hm.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.719
The mac and cheese.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.356
Meatballs.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.197
The soup.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.266
No. Wait.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.669
I only thought about
getting the soup.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.639
Hilarious.

14:32.772 --> 14:35.508
I barely see my wife anymore,

14:35.642 --> 14:38.678
and when I do,
I'm just so tired
and irritated all the time.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.750
Have you been
self-medicating?

14:45.385 --> 14:48.155
Stimulants?
Amphetamines, maybe?

14:53.961 --> 14:56.496
I asked
if I could join,

14:56.629 --> 14:58.498
find out what my boyfriend
was like in college,

14:58.631 --> 15:00.700
and then...

15:00.833 --> 15:02.669
That was
a record scratch.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.537
He totally shut me out.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.373
Oh, that's so cool

15:06.506 --> 15:09.376
you and Jerome
are officially "boyfriends."

15:11.544 --> 15:13.180
You just called him that.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.358
I called him
my boyfriend.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.362
That's why
he freaked out.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.432
Wait.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.700
Was that...

15:33.833 --> 15:34.734
The first time?

15:36.369 --> 15:37.537
Oh, man.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.106
No. No.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.574
That's not
an unreasonable thing
to assume, right?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.343
We've been on dates.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.413
We've even had breakfast
the morning after,

15:46.546 --> 15:48.948
but maybe
he's seeing other people.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.220
Hey, man.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.523
You said how you feel,
you just laid it out there,
and that's great.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.391
You gotta be
who you are.
Yeah.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.293
Otherwise, you'll
find yourself moving
into a new place

16:00.427 --> 16:02.462
where your kickass recliner
is hidden away upstairs.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.796
You deserve better
than that.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.698
You deserve
the space to be you,

16:05.832 --> 16:06.966
to express yourself.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.271
Sorta got lost
in the middle there,
but you're right.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.606
I should
express myself.

16:13.740 --> 16:14.807
And we need to start...

16:16.743 --> 16:17.777
Now.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.121
Dr. Murphy.
Hm?

16:28.255 --> 16:29.656
This man has been waiting
on Dr. Glassman.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.324
Can you grab him?
Oh, no, if he's on
Dr. Glassman's list...

16:31.458 --> 16:32.625
He's falling
a bit behind.

16:34.961 --> 16:35.995
Okay.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.701
Frank went off
to the bathroom.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.970
Then Park...wrestled me out.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.576
On the count of three.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.180
One, two...

17:03.556 --> 17:04.791
It's my boyfriend!

17:04.924 --> 17:06.326
Oh!

17:06.459 --> 17:07.460
That's right!

17:07.594 --> 17:09.162
And I'm not afraid to say it!

17:09.296 --> 17:10.963
Oh!
He's not afraid to say it!

17:11.098 --> 17:14.834
And I'm not afraid to say
I love my recliner!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.836
Yeah!
Whoo!

17:16.969 --> 17:19.872
Yeah! Whoo!
Whoo!

17:20.006 --> 17:21.441
Get up here!
Come on!

17:21.574 --> 17:23.643
Feel the music!

17:23.776 --> 17:25.978
Oh!

17:26.113 --> 17:27.147
Oh, oh!
Here come the strings!

17:29.816 --> 17:30.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:34.087 --> 17:35.222
You okay?

17:35.355 --> 17:37.224
Ow.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.527
We love Vanessa Carlton!

17:40.660 --> 17:42.862
Does your family have
any history of strokes?

17:42.995 --> 17:44.264
I'm not sure.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.232
Heart attacks?
Blood clots?

17:45.365 --> 17:47.500
Why? Is that what's happening?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.569
I'm going to re-take
your blood pressure.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.071
Doctor, I-I...
I don't feel right.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.342
190 over 110.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.009
I need a 35 milligram push
of esmolol.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.345
What's happening?

17:58.478 --> 17:59.379
You're in range
for complications

17:59.512 --> 18:00.780
from a hypertensive crisis.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.515
Uh, like a heart attack?

18:02.649 --> 18:03.616
That's one possibility.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.418
S-So I'm having
a heart attack?

18:05.552 --> 18:08.155
Not yet.
This should bring down
your blood pressure.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.027
Continue to take
deep breaths.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.096
Does Dr. Glassman have
any more patients on hold?

18:17.230 --> 18:18.298
There are two more.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.699
I will take them.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.901
I'm faster than Dr. Glassman,
and we need to...

18:22.034 --> 18:23.503
Doctor, help.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.373
I can't breathe.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.540
The O2 levels
are dropping.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.109
Increasing
oxygen flow rate.

18:32.679 --> 18:33.980
Get Dr. Glassman.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.220
Mr. Cho, you had
a minor asthma attack

18:40.353 --> 18:42.255
as a result
of the esmolol.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.257
W-Why did he
give it to me then?

18:44.391 --> 18:46.559
You didn't tell the nurse
about your asthma.
Shaun.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.761
Didn't anyone check
my medical records?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.398
You were an E.R. walk-in,
and your blood pressure was...

18:51.531 --> 18:53.700
Shaun, do me a favor, please,
and... And step outside
and meet me in the hall?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.307
Mr. Cho,

19:00.440 --> 19:02.675
the important thing is that
your vitals are normal now,

19:02.809 --> 19:06.078
and there won't be
any long-term effects
as a result of the medication.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.214
I'll be right back.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.121
You didn't have time
to get a clear history?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.757
His blood pressure
was critically high
and trending up.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.592
And now it's low.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.494
I warned you about this,
didn't I?

19:21.628 --> 19:23.930
You were stressed
and then you stressed him.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.499
Okay, I would
feel less stressed
if you were moving faster.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.000
That's not your call.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.168
I wasn't wrong.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.870
An asthmatic response
to esmolol

19:31.003 --> 19:33.540
is rare and less critical
than a hypertensive crisis.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.043
And if you had not
been so slow to get
to the patient...

19:37.176 --> 19:39.812
Shaun.
...because I know you are
not able to work at my pace,

19:39.946 --> 19:42.615
but your medical strategy
is not working. No, no.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.784
Work at your pace?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.152
Yes.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.356
You need to go get something
to eat, take a break.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.623
No, thank you.
I need to get...

19:50.757 --> 19:52.892
I said take a break!

19:53.025 --> 19:56.763
If you don't
want to eat something,
then go take a walk!

19:56.896 --> 19:57.697
Now!

20:01.568 --> 20:03.403
I'll take care
of Mr. Cho.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.179
Ow.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.647
That was quite the fall.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.051
I'm sorry I flipped you out,
calling you my boyfriend.

20:19.185 --> 20:23.155
But I... I need to know if
you're seeing other people.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.491
No.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.059
No, I'm not seeing
anyone else.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.630
And, yes,
the boyfriend thing
did surprise me,

20:30.763 --> 20:32.899
but...I liked it.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.836
Ow.

20:36.969 --> 20:40.707
Not enough to introduce me
to your college friends?

20:40.840 --> 20:41.874
You wouldn't like them.
They're boring.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.478
They're boring, or...

20:46.813 --> 20:49.048
Or I'm boring?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.450
Or too loud?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.852
Or too young?

20:52.985 --> 20:55.288
Like, what about me
is so embarrassing?

20:58.691 --> 20:59.692
I just...

21:02.028 --> 21:03.896
I just thought
you wouldn't want to...

21:04.030 --> 21:05.932
Listen to us
rehash our glory days.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.636
Okay, if that was you
thinking of an excuse,

21:09.769 --> 21:11.571
you should have
taken longer.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.509
Just finish me up
and take me back
to the Break Room, please.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.612
Okay.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.653
Try and drink
as much as you can.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.921
Ever stop and think
how bizarre it is
that we got together?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.690
Like, if you'd told us
even a year ago...

21:30.823 --> 21:32.291
Well, stranger things
have happened.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.893
Wha...

21:34.026 --> 21:36.429
I landed weird earlier.
You know what else is weird?

21:36.563 --> 21:38.431
How people say
"opposites attract."

21:38.565 --> 21:39.899
But the novelty
wears off, right?

21:40.032 --> 21:41.834
Remember that video
with Paula Abdul

21:41.968 --> 21:43.703
and that cartoon cat...
They didn't have a future.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.237
They probably couldn't agree
on furniture, either.

21:45.372 --> 21:47.239
How about
we talk about this later?

21:47.374 --> 21:49.041
You know, that recliner
has been with me
through marriage,

21:49.175 --> 21:50.443
Kellan, med school, divo...

21:50.577 --> 21:52.345
I asked you to put it
in the den, not throw it out.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.113
Because you're embarrassed
by it. You don't respect it.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.784
If you don't respect it,
maybe you don't respect me.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.952
And before you know it,
you'll be hiding me upstairs

22:00.086 --> 22:02.389
in a house you're paying for,
where you'll be the boss,

22:02.522 --> 22:04.757
and I'll be nothing but a sad,
lonely piece of furniture.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.462
You're not furniture,
but you are high,

22:09.596 --> 22:11.864
and in no shape to be having
a rational conversation.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.766
Keep hydrating.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.674
What are you doing?

22:26.513 --> 22:28.180
I can climb this wall.

22:28.314 --> 22:30.082
I need to climb
this wall.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.418
What, like...

22:32.785 --> 22:33.786
Spider-Man?

22:34.454 --> 22:36.689
Exactly like Spider-Man.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.491
Cool, cool.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.226
Hey, just please be quiet.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.865
I'll need
a running start.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.600
It'll take power
and inertia to stick.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.339
No. Wait, wait, no!

22:53.473 --> 22:54.541
You gotta let me do this.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.743
You're delusional.
No.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.177
And you're gonna
wake the snakes.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.680
I'm President.

23:00.813 --> 23:01.881
If I want to climb the wall,

23:02.014 --> 23:02.815
I will climb the wall.

23:07.854 --> 23:11.558
What did Spider-Man
value the most?

23:11.691 --> 23:13.325
That with great power
comes great resp...

23:13.460 --> 23:15.027
Yeah, yeah, that.
Yeah. But also...

23:16.629 --> 23:18.498
His secret identity.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.735
If you have
these powers,

23:22.869 --> 23:26.205
you don't want people
to know, right?

23:26.338 --> 23:27.840
Yeah.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.410
You're right.
Good thinking.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.013
Yeah.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.548
Are you stroking
my sleeve?

23:36.449 --> 23:38.050
Yeah.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.486
Yeah.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.853
This is incredible.

23:43.890 --> 23:44.857
What is it?

23:47.494 --> 23:48.695
Cashmere.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.430
Yeah.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.206
Dr. Murphy.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.908
Take a look
at his ultrasound.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.410
I'm taking a break.
I am eating an apple.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.878
It's very strange.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.555
His spleen is on
the wrong side.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.324
Okay.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.595
Were you in
a car accident?

24:22.729 --> 24:23.930
No, he used a ball launcher

24:24.063 --> 24:25.632
to fire a basketball
at his stomach.

24:25.765 --> 24:26.899
Yeah, my followers
love that stuff.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.301
You have
a wandering spleen.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.671
The ligaments holding
it were likely weakened
from past trauma.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.006
The impact from the ball
caused it to break away.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.142
Oh, snap. Can you
e-mail me those pics?

24:36.275 --> 24:38.210
That's dope content
for my follow-up video.

24:38.344 --> 24:39.646
L-Later.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.614
You're not getting adequate
blood flow to the spleen.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.482
We need to get you
into surgery now.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.918
Sweet. Hey, can you guys
film this for me?

24:48.621 --> 24:51.390
Urine samples
from the dosed
are inconclusive.

24:51.524 --> 24:52.925
Any food updates?

24:53.059 --> 24:56.829
No-go on the ribs
and the pasta salad.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.501
In your extensive
tripping experience,

25:02.635 --> 25:04.303
do people
usually talk crazy

25:04.436 --> 25:06.072
or reveal their
true feelings?

25:06.205 --> 25:07.239
Both.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.441
Though often
they're related.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.477
Yeah, Park's
definitely acting crazy.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.012
I mean,
dancing on tables?

25:14.781 --> 25:18.017
You want to talk Park
or the mystery?

25:18.651 --> 25:20.019
Both?

25:21.287 --> 25:22.354
Great.

25:22.488 --> 25:25.124
We just moved in together,
and now he's rambling

25:25.257 --> 25:26.659
about how opposites
don't attract.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.662
Or shouldn't? I...

25:29.796 --> 25:32.131
You know the word rambling
can refer to horny horses?

25:36.102 --> 25:38.004
Maybe he's just nervous
about change.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.140
Park doesn't get nervous.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.709
Well, it's either
completely irrelevant

25:42.842 --> 25:43.843
or something you two
need to have

25:43.976 --> 25:45.845
a very serious talk about.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.849
Isn't Dr. Gentry vegan?

25:52.418 --> 25:54.453
Yes.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.155
That takes out chicken,
mac and cheese, and Jell-O.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.358
The sweet potatoes.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.426
Whose dish was that?

26:01.661 --> 26:03.329
That's impossible.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.998
I got the recipe online.
I followed it exactly.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.867
Interesting.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.802
And did you help him?

26:11.838 --> 26:13.405
You think
I did something
to his dish?

26:13.539 --> 26:15.007
Maybe you thought
it'd be funny.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.711
That makes no sense,
which isn't surprising

26:18.845 --> 26:20.780
because you're tripping.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.215
But I'm not,
and I remember

26:23.349 --> 26:25.551
you put a bag labeled "organs"
in the shared fridge

26:25.685 --> 26:28.020
and changed Dr. Riley's
license plate to "IMPOTENT."

26:29.021 --> 26:30.657
Those were harmless pranks,

26:32.024 --> 26:34.593
unlike dosing a hospital.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.395
I'm sorry... Pause.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.432
When exactly was
this Prank Master era?

26:40.566 --> 26:43.936
It wasn't an era.
It was just some stuff I did
my first few years here.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.037
Oh.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.039
So you were different then?

26:48.574 --> 26:50.042
Or are you just morphing
into different people

26:50.176 --> 26:51.644
depending on
who you're talking to?

26:51.778 --> 26:53.946
Do you have
other personalities

26:54.080 --> 26:55.181
that I should know about?

26:55.314 --> 26:58.050
Whatever you ate
is making you paranoid.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.620
If this is going to work,

27:01.754 --> 27:03.656
you need to be
your true self with me.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.492
Enough couples' therapy.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.627
Go to your apartment
and bring back
all the ingredients.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.062
Okay, no problem.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.068
Hello. You're scheduled
to assist Dr. Glassman

27:16.202 --> 27:17.403
on the wandering spleen
surgery.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.805
That is my patient.
Okay.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.239
With a spleen
this fractured,

27:20.372 --> 27:21.708
complications could
easily be missed...

27:21.841 --> 27:24.110
Peritonitis,
fragments left behind
that can cause infection.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.645
You need to convince
Dr. Glassman
to let me assist, too.

27:26.779 --> 27:27.980
Why can't you
tell him yourself?

27:28.114 --> 27:29.448
We had an argument
a few hours ago.

27:29.581 --> 27:30.817
I'm not sure
he would listen to me.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.052
Then by all means,
you should operate with him.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.787
Yes.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.691
Today has been rough enough
without you dragging me

27:38.825 --> 27:41.293
into the middle
of whatever this thing is.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.829
Talk to Glassman
yourself.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.473
I am not scheduled
for this spleen surgery,
but I should be included.

27:54.606 --> 27:55.875
This is
a rare procedure.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.276
Did you take a break?

27:57.409 --> 27:58.410
I had an apple.

27:59.779 --> 28:00.880
Half an apple.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.615
I understand if you're
disappointed, Shaun.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.617
I need a team
who listens to me,

28:05.752 --> 28:08.287
who knows my style,
and who embraces it.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.023
Just because I don't
like to talk about
irrelevant topics

28:11.157 --> 28:12.624
doesn't mean
I can't help.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.426
Shaun, Shaun,
you're not in this surgery.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.146
Hey.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.316
I thought about
what you said

28:37.449 --> 28:40.352
about the recliner
and...other things.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.223
Once this is over,
we should talk.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.293
Ow.
What's wrong?

28:47.426 --> 28:49.295
Park? Park.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.797
Park.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.565
I need CBC, blood cultures,
and CT, stat.

28:55.868 --> 28:56.602
Where does it hurt?

29:03.109 --> 29:05.812
Good job double checking
at the end there.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.046
Thank you.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.282
With a spleen
this fractured,

29:10.416 --> 29:11.717
complications can be
easily missed...

29:11.851 --> 29:13.519
Peritonitis,

29:13.652 --> 29:15.922
fragments left behind
that can cause infection.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.189
That sounds familiar.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.194
You're stressing him out.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.431
You made him
question himself.

29:28.234 --> 29:31.037
He should question himself.
He's a great surgeon.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.840
Great surgeons
should continue
to question themselves.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.607
That's how we learn.

29:35.741 --> 29:38.210
Shaun is great,
and he's learned
a lot from you.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.081
Maybe it's time
you let him
return the favor.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.920
I've learned a lot
from both of you.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.725
Stat page to O.R. One.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.663
I'll meet you there.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.038
<i>Olive oil,</i>
<i>pecans, cilantro.</i>

30:06.172 --> 30:09.108
Seasonings?
<i>Salt, pepper...</i>

30:09.241 --> 30:11.243
Okay, we need an answer now.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.945
Park has
advanced appendicitis.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.147
He needs surgery,
but not before we know
what's in his system.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.615
<i>I got everything.</i>
<i>On my way back.</i>

30:16.748 --> 30:18.484
Wait, Jerome, go back.

30:19.718 --> 30:21.720
Wait. Bring the phone closer
to the seasonings.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.858
No. That's the wrong
cumin shaker.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.426
I used the other one.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.627
<i>What other shaker?</i>

30:28.760 --> 30:31.330
The first shaker
was almost empty

30:31.463 --> 30:33.232
so I used the one
from your spice rack.

30:33.365 --> 30:34.400
The clear one.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.734
<i>I don't have another...</i>

30:40.973 --> 30:42.641
It's psilocybin.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.111
Magic mushrooms.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.113
<i>A few weeks ago,</i>
<i>my roommate had a party.</i>

30:47.246 --> 30:49.015
<i>Someone brought shrooms</i>
<i>in a cumin shaker.</i>

30:49.148 --> 30:50.249
That's all we need.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.951
Shrooms won't disrupt
anesthesia.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.152
We can operate.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.824
Jake Khan was
originally admitted
with an amputated toe,

30:58.958 --> 31:00.192
but his most recent EKG
was abnormal.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.161
CTA revealed an anomalous
left coronary artery.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.629
He's at risk
of cardiac arrest.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.031
Since you don't
want me in the O.R.,

31:05.164 --> 31:06.598
you and Dr. Allen
will need to open him up

31:06.732 --> 31:08.200
and increase blood flow
to his heart.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.005
This is complicated.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.842
I'm gonna need
a senior resident.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.211
I'm a senior resident.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.312
Yes, I know.
Let's scrub in.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.516
Dr. Glassman, Park
is in O.R. number three.

31:24.650 --> 31:25.651
On the table.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.119
His appendix
is about to rupture.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.388
We have an immediate
cardiac surgery here.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.757
It's a quick laparoscopic.
And it's Park.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.962
The moment we're in
the home stretch,

31:36.095 --> 31:37.863
Dr. Murphy can start
the procedure on him.

31:37.997 --> 31:38.797
What about Dr. Allen?

31:41.100 --> 31:44.870
She's only a second-year.
Solo surgeries are third year.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.238
I assisted
appendectomies

31:46.372 --> 31:47.506
all the time
in my second year.

31:47.639 --> 31:48.407
I can talk her through.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.043
I got this.

31:53.479 --> 31:54.346
Go prep.

32:03.022 --> 32:06.825
Well, look at
all the areas of stenosis.

32:06.959 --> 32:11.830
Or would you prefer to discuss
sports or another topic?

32:11.964 --> 32:14.366
I appreciate that. I'm good
with the medicine for now.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.138
And there's the anomaly.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.073
What's the ideal approach?

32:21.207 --> 32:22.574
We should unroof
the coronary.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.344
An incision into the ostium
to the aortic root.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.845
You heard the man.
Let's get to cutting.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.422
How do you feel?

32:36.555 --> 32:38.390
Still itching
to climb these walls?

32:39.858 --> 32:41.093
Thanks for talking me down.

32:41.227 --> 32:44.130
That could have been...ugly.

32:46.865 --> 32:50.602
You know, I never pegged you
for a Spider-Man fan.

32:50.736 --> 32:54.273
Always pictured you watching
a 10-part Ken Burns doc

32:54.406 --> 32:56.108
on the history
of pencils.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.809
Mm.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.480
Isabel dragged me
to the first movie,

33:03.449 --> 33:04.583
and I loved it.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.720
Peter Parker reminded me
of myself at that age.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.424
Science nerds unite.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.095
She really
knew me well.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.432
When I was a first-year,

33:21.433 --> 33:23.135
I had this nightmare shift,

33:23.269 --> 33:25.937
and this other resident
insisted,

33:26.072 --> 33:28.640
instead of going home
and falling apart,

33:28.774 --> 33:32.211
that we see the matinee
of <i>Spider-Man 3.</i>

33:32.344 --> 33:34.046
Thought it would
cheer me up.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.215
That's a good friend.
Yeah.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.716
Melendez was pretty cool.

33:42.788 --> 33:45.924
Seeing those movies became
a bit of a tradition for us.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.063
I haven't seen
the new one yet.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.501
It feels...off
without him.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.406
Yeah.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.174
It isn't the same
without Isabel, either.

34:07.513 --> 34:10.449
The other day,
I was working on

34:10.582 --> 34:12.384
projected hospital goals
for the year,

34:12.518 --> 34:14.320
and it got me
thinking about...

34:17.623 --> 34:19.858
The life goals
I had set for myself.

34:19.991 --> 34:20.726
Mm.

34:22.528 --> 34:23.529
A new house...

34:25.731 --> 34:26.865
The presidency...

34:30.402 --> 34:31.503
Kids.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.709
And I never imagined
a version without Isabel.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.183
And here I am...

34:45.984 --> 34:49.054
Alone,
surrounded by people
who hate me.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.422
Yeah, not that
I blame them.

34:57.729 --> 34:58.964
I don't hate you.

35:01.032 --> 35:04.470
Don't get me wrong,
you're a major
pain in the ass.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.938
And I do not love the way
you became president,

35:09.241 --> 35:11.910
but it's a level
of responsibility

35:12.043 --> 35:13.779
I don't even
want to comprehend.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.716
And you make it
look so easy
it's infuriating.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.586
And you're actually
not half bad at it.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.490
Tell anyone
I said that

35:24.623 --> 35:26.225
and I'll tell them
you tried to run
into a wall.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.566
Don't move.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.035
There's a snake
beside you.

35:48.013 --> 35:50.282
And done.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.083
Decrease the flow
and let's check out
the heart.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.593
Function's not improving.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.695
Heart's not getting
adequate perfusion.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.963
We need a bigger fix.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.934
We can make a patch,
widen the vessel,

36:09.067 --> 36:10.902
and increase the blood flow,
but that's not ideal.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.504
The risk of thrombosis
is too high.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.105
He might not even
last a few hours.

36:16.575 --> 36:20.746
We could move
the left coronary artery

36:20.879 --> 36:22.180
from the right side
of the aorta

36:22.314 --> 36:23.615
and re-implant it
to the correct side.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.519
That's a hell of an idea.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.856
Dr. Murphy, take the lead.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.969
We need to get back
on full bypass.

36:44.102 --> 36:45.971
7-0 prolene sutures.

37:00.686 --> 37:01.720
That was good work.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.729
I shouldn't have
cut you out of
the surgery earlier.

37:10.862 --> 37:11.863
I'm sorry.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.670
It's been a long time
since I've done
an all-nighter.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.375
I thought
it was quite invigorating.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.779
I need a Scotch.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.247
It's 8:00 a.m.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.550
I know. Care to join?

37:46.832 --> 37:48.767
Officially cleared
for discharge.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.871
I wanted to apologize
for before.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.573
I was kind of an ass.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.877
You were right before.
I wasn't being myself
with you,

38:00.245 --> 38:03.081
or...not my whole self
at least.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.085
I was
a bit of a goofball
in college.

38:07.218 --> 38:08.987
My buddies still can't believe
I work in a hospital.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.424
I like to think
I've changed, but...

38:14.192 --> 38:16.428
That part of me
is still there

38:16.562 --> 38:20.966
and tends to come roaring back
when I'm around them.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.934
And you thought
that would be
an issue for me?

38:24.936 --> 38:27.038
You're a doctor.

38:27.172 --> 38:30.442
I figured you wanted
someone smart, mature...

38:32.778 --> 38:33.745
Serious.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.583
That's what I thought
you wanted.

38:38.984 --> 38:45.090
I spent so much of my life
in Orthodox world...

38:45.223 --> 38:47.559
I still don't feel like
I know what I'm doing.

38:50.228 --> 38:52.564
And you seemed like
you had it all figured out.

38:52.698 --> 38:53.765
It felt...

38:55.300 --> 38:56.635
It felt intimidating.

38:56.768 --> 38:57.936
I have so little
figured out,

38:59.838 --> 39:00.772
except that
I'm really into you.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.512
I'm meeting my friends
at Grant's Tavern.

39:06.645 --> 39:07.779
If you're still
interested?

39:12.651 --> 39:14.553
Say. Yes.

39:20.826 --> 39:21.993
You okay?

39:22.127 --> 39:24.863
All good.
Just waiting for Shaunie.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.341
As your surgeon,

39:36.475 --> 39:38.309
I advise no exercise
for six weeks,

39:38.444 --> 39:39.411
keep the wound dry.

39:39.545 --> 39:40.712
I'm well aware.

39:40.846 --> 39:41.980
Please,
listen to your surgeon.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.684
Dr. Reznick,
nice to see you.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.153
Last time we were all together
was in the operating room
during my solo surgery...

39:48.286 --> 39:49.320
Please leave.

39:56.495 --> 39:59.397
I've been thinking
about the recliner.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.733
Mm.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.569
Was I, uh, ranting
about that thing?

40:03.702 --> 40:04.836
You were.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.840
I thought we could keep it
in the living room,

40:08.974 --> 40:14.012
but get it re-upholstered
in a fabric we agree on.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.348
Make it something
that represents us both.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.252
No purple.

40:21.386 --> 40:22.420
Otherwise, deal.

40:27.559 --> 40:30.729
S... Do you remember
anything else from last night?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.536
Beyond that
I should never dance
in public again?

40:37.669 --> 40:39.771
No. Why?

40:39.905 --> 40:41.306
Was there
something important?

40:42.608 --> 40:45.043
No, nothing important.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.062
Hey.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.263
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>Get home all right?</i>

41:05.396 --> 41:07.733
I did. Everything okay?

41:07.866 --> 41:09.601
<i>Better than okay.</i>
<i>Turn on your TV.</i>

41:09.735 --> 41:11.002
<i>Channel 39.</i>

41:14.773 --> 41:18.309
You know, I was thinking,
how about a weekly meeting?

41:18.443 --> 41:20.478
<i>Be good to keep a line</i>
<i>of communication open.</i>

41:20.612 --> 41:22.213
I'd like that, thanks.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.985
<i>Spider-Man 2,</i> awesome.

41:30.388 --> 41:32.624
<i>We'll do it here.</i>

41:32.758 --> 41:35.794
"The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand."

41:35.927 --> 41:38.597
"Nothing will stand
in our way."

41:38.730 --> 41:39.931
"Nothing!"
"Nothing!"

41:46.605 --> 41:50.308
To us evolving.

41:56.414 --> 41:58.016
Hm.

41:58.149 --> 41:59.951
I think
I prefer tequila.

42:00.085 --> 42:02.420
You've got
a lot to learn.
