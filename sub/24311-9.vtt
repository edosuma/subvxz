- Mr. President!</i>

00:10.551 --> 00:12.987
Wow!
Spring has sprung.

00:12.988 --> 00:16.190
All winter long, adult-film
stars have been hibernating,

00:16.190 --> 00:17.524
bellies full of fish,

00:17.525 --> 00:19.693
and now they're all emerging
from their caves,

00:19.694 --> 00:21.762
giving interviews
to Anderson Cooper.

00:21.763 --> 00:24.864
Sir, why haven't you refuted
the Stormy Daniels allegations?

00:24.865 --> 00:27.200
I'm trying to take the high road
and do everything I can

00:27.201 --> 00:29.869
not to have a picture
of my penis go public.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.604
I mean, that thing is like a vampire ...

00:31.605 --> 00:33.539
bloodless, can't see it in a mirror,

00:33.540 --> 00:36.575
and, at first, Eastern European
women fall in love with it,

00:36.576 --> 00:38.945
but, eventually, they try to
drive a wooden stake through it.

00:38.946 --> 00:41.180
Are you having trouble hiring lawyers?

00:41.181 --> 00:45.617
I've got great, great lawyer.
His name is Jay Sekulow.

00:45.618 --> 00:47.920
He looks like the one guy in
the women-and-children lifeboat,

00:47.921 --> 00:49.554
and he's working hard on my case

00:49.555 --> 00:52.191
in the makeup chair
between cable-news appearances.

00:52.192 --> 00:54.092
Will you be bringing on
any other representation?

00:54.093 --> 00:55.393
Glad you asked.

00:55.394 --> 00:57.296
I'm pleased to announce
I have a new lawyer

00:57.297 --> 00:59.730
who's poised
to completely exonerate me

00:59.731 --> 01:03.034
or negotiate my secret
3:00 a.m. airlift to Moscow.

01:03.035 --> 01:05.135
And like any respectable law firm,

01:05.137 --> 01:08.139
he's got a great television
commercial. Take a look.

01:08.140 --> 01:10.708
<i>When you're represented
by Jean-Luc Tannenbaum,</i>

01:10.709 --> 01:12.376
<i>you're represented by the best.</i>

01:12.377 --> 01:15.078
<i>Tannenbaum received
his degree in law crimes</i>

01:15.079 --> 01:18.081

01:18.082 --> 01:20.901

<i>from the family courts

01:23.721 --> 01:26.256

01:26.257 --> 01:29.425
<i>He's a pillar of his community,
a family man,</i>

01:29.426 --> 01:32.427
<i>and has had sex with more
than 50 of his clients.</i>

01:32.428 --> 01:33.829
Not bad, huh?

01:33.830 --> 01:37.599
<i>For a consultation, visit Jean-Luc

01:37.600 --> 01:40.269

Shark! Oh, God, no-no!

01:56.485 --> 02:00.421
So sayeth Genesis,
"When all the land of Egypt

02:00.422 --> 02:04.492
was famished, the people
cried out to Pharaoh for bread."

02:04.493 --> 02:08.195
Bread's expensive, people!
Good move by the pharaoh.

02:08.196 --> 02:11.031
Mr. President, would you like
to say a few words?

02:11.032 --> 02:12.465
Uh, totally optional, by the way.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.666
We'd understand if you'd rather no...

02:13.667 --> 02:16.669
Wow! Jesus never
drew a crowd this big.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.472
Did you know he was Jewish?
You picture Hugh Jackman,

02:19.473 --> 02:22.209
when Jesus actually looked like
a little orthodontist.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.677
<i> How was church today?</i>

02:25.678 --> 02:27.980
Uneventful.

<i>Was that Joseph guy a putz, or what?</i>

<i>Clearly, he wasn't taking care

02:41.493 --> 02:43.995
<i>I mean, if God knocked up my
wife, he'd never doink again.</i>

02:43.996 --> 02:48.033
<i>- I'd cut off God's penis.
- Sir, I think that's a hot Mic.</i>

02:48.034 --> 02:50.035
<i>Mike, stop acting like a tech buff.</i>

02:50.036 --> 02:53.338
<i>You think your great-grandfather
hunted dinosaurs.</i>

02:53.339 --> 02:55.307
How do grown adults
still worship Jesus?

02:55.308 --> 02:57.474
I mean, where was Jesus
when the Taj Mahal

02:57.475 --> 02:59.310
was at a standstill with the unions?

02:59.311 --> 03:01.345
Sometimes people need to believe

03:01.346 --> 03:03.414
in something bigger than themselves.

03:03.415 --> 03:06.016
Like how I believe
this entire experience

03:06.017 --> 03:09.720
is just a dream inside a giant's mind,
and when he wakes up,

03:09.721 --> 03:13.922
I will be back in Trump Tower
with my friends, the help.

03:16.493 --> 03:18.694
Sir, I'm told your
imitation of Moses' stutter

03:18.695 --> 03:22.098
at church was inspiring.
There's just one problem.

03:22.099 --> 03:25.168
You appear to have gaps
in your Bible knowledge.

03:25.169 --> 03:28.237
If a book doesn't have "Adventure
Dog" in the title, I haven't read it.

03:28.238 --> 03:30.773
Before the White House
Easter festivities,

03:30.774 --> 03:32.907
I think it would be wise to study up

03:32.908 --> 03:35.043
in Mike Pence's weekly Bible study.

03:35.044 --> 03:38.113
Can I still attend if I'm
in Palm Beach and golfing?

03:38.414 --> 03:41.583
And, uh, if you ever want to hang
out, just let me know, Ezra.

03:41.584 --> 03:43.918
Might be the last time without
a corrections officer listening in.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.520
<i>Yeah, I'm good,
but I'll get in touch</i>

03:45.521 --> 03:47.922
<i>if I ever need advice
on how to screw up my life.</i>

03:49.124 --> 03:50.858
Well, it's official.

03:50.859 --> 03:52.860
My only human contact, our lawyer,

03:52.861 --> 03:56.063
- is telling me not to talk to humans.
- Jared, don't give up.

03:56.064 --> 03:57.631
Everyone needs friends.

03:57.632 --> 04:00.966
I don't know what
I would do without...

04:02.437 --> 04:05.205
Anyways, if you don't have
friends, you don't have likes,

04:05.206 --> 04:07.474
and if you don't have likes,
you don't exist.

04:10.911 --> 04:13.446
You guys don't believe
any of this Jesus stuff, right?

04:13.447 --> 04:14.914
Hell no!
We pray in the name of

04:14.915 --> 04:17.916
- the Dad, the sons...
- The sons are us, Dad!

04:17.918 --> 04:21.620
...and the holy spirit of tossing
chicks into swimming pools.

04:21.622 --> 04:22.721
- Amen!
- Amen!

04:22.722 --> 04:23.922
- Jinx!
- Fuck you!

04:23.923 --> 04:26.091
Jared, your nerd ass
is probably obsessed

04:26.092 --> 04:27.893
with that lame Jesus
church shit, right?

04:27.894 --> 04:32.464
I'm Jewish! You were at
my very Jewish wedding.

04:32.465 --> 04:34.099
You must have been doing
the Jewish stuff

04:34.100 --> 04:36.235
while I was lifting
those chairs up and down.

04:37.837 --> 04:39.637
And one last piece of positive news ...

04:39.638 --> 04:42.507
the support from your
evangelical base has dropped,

04:42.508 --> 04:44.409
support amongst people
who toss soda bottles

04:44.410 --> 04:46.677
in the air and shoot them
continues to grow.

04:46.678 --> 04:49.247
No way his evangelical
support dropped.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.582
They forgave you for the
"Access Hollywood" tape

04:51.583 --> 04:53.017
and for allowing Puerto Rico

04:53.018 --> 04:55.420
to fester in pitch-black
darkness even to this day.

04:55.421 --> 04:57.521
Things always get messy
for religious types

04:57.522 --> 04:59.756
when you bring God's junk
into the equation.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.358
Mike, how do you spin it

05:01.359 --> 05:04.496
when you'd say you'd cut
off God's penis?

05:04.929 --> 05:07.197
I'll wake him up.
Two men holding hands!

05:07.198 --> 05:10.033
- Not in my Denny's!
- There's my little zealot.

05:10.034 --> 05:12.668
Sir, this is serious.
Your most devout supports

05:12.669 --> 05:15.471
are threatening to boycott
your Easter festivities.

05:15.472 --> 05:17.773
Lose their support,
and you'll lose your shot

05:17.774 --> 05:20.142
at that second term
you have no interest in.

05:23.713 --> 05:26.014
<i> Lord President, did you know</i>

05:26.015 --> 05:28.350
if you rearrange the letters
in "Donald J. Trump,"

05:28.351 --> 05:31.852
- it spells Jesus?
- That's not true, Stevie.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.688
But you can make it true.

05:33.689 --> 05:37.325
If you become the holy president
the faithful yearn for,

05:37.326 --> 05:40.295
your power will exceed earthly bounds.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.398
You'll be able to skip to the front
of the line of the Reptile House,

05:43.399 --> 05:46.401
change Oprah's name
to Jebediah ... finally,

05:46.402 --> 05:49.303
turn water into viscous, spicy wine,

05:49.304 --> 05:52.839
and smite my barber's
smarmy shampoo boy!

05:52.840 --> 05:53.873
I don't know, Stevie.

05:57.212 --> 05:58.645
Also, you will be tax-exempt.

05:58.646 --> 06:00.847
I'm in!
Tell my three wives

06:00.848 --> 06:04.683
I'm going to be the most
Christian president in history!

06:04.684 --> 06:07.686
<i> History! History...</i>

06:09.389 --> 06:12.858
All right, churchies,
I want evangelicals so loyal

06:12.859 --> 06:15.161
that they give me the six-dollar
shirts off their backs.

06:15.162 --> 06:16.496
Let's hear ideas.

06:16.497 --> 06:18.598
If the Bible has taught me anything,

06:18.599 --> 06:20.866
it's that I should wait
for the men around me

06:20.867 --> 06:22.234
to explain what I've learned.

06:22.235 --> 06:25.036
What Betsy means is that
Jesus gained followers

06:25.037 --> 06:28.673
- by being a faithful servant of God.
- I'm always faithful ...

06:28.674 --> 06:31.109
as long as I don't meet
a younger, hotter God.

06:31.110 --> 06:33.378
I find the best way
to gain a following

06:33.379 --> 06:35.747
is to buy a street
vender's umbrella

06:35.748 --> 06:39.915
and twirl it in front of
pedestrians as free theater.

06:41.419 --> 06:44.721
Sir, to help bring the Christian
community into your embrace,

06:44.722 --> 06:47.191
how about I schedule
a pre-Easter appearance

06:47.192 --> 06:48.959
at a Houston megachurch?

06:48.960 --> 06:51.262
Great idea.
Just don't bring Karen.

06:51.263 --> 06:54.898
Jesus was already crucified.
No need to bore him to death.

06:57.601 --> 06:59.469
<i> Baruch atah Adonai.</i>

06:59.470 --> 07:00.637
<i>Eloheinu, Melech, haolam ...</i>

07:00.638 --> 07:03.273
Birthday's over, Jared!

07:03.274 --> 07:05.441
We're gonna make you
a real Trump!

07:05.442 --> 07:08.244
What did I do to make you think
that I want to be a real Trump,

07:08.245 --> 07:11.548
- so I know never to do it again?
- Time to follow the Trump creed.

07:11.549 --> 07:14.149
Number one, make the Dad
look good, no matter what.

07:14.150 --> 07:16.552
And, two, when not making
the Dad look good,

07:16.553 --> 07:19.154
make the sons look cool as shit.

07:19.155 --> 07:22.658
Don't you want to send back
an entrée for the fourth time?

07:22.659 --> 07:24.793
Steal your dentist's prescription pad?

07:24.794 --> 07:27.996
Buy size-14 shoes
when you're actually a 5 1/2?

07:27.997 --> 07:30.748
God, that sounds miserable.
What do you think, honey?

07:30.783 --> 07:33.501
I think you need to have
meaningful friendships

07:33.502 --> 07:37.758
to care about something bigger
than yourself. Like when I...

07:39.308 --> 07:41.342
Well, I've already sold
my soul to the devil.

07:41.343 --> 07:44.245
Might as well snort Adderall
with his cologne-drenched demons.

07:44.246 --> 07:47.290
Hell yeah! Now let's
get you uncircumcised.

07:47.325 --> 07:49.603
Ha. Good one.

07:52.119 --> 07:54.621
<i>For thine is the kingdom</i>

07:54.622 --> 07:56.856
<i>and the power and the glory,</i>

07:56.857 --> 07:58.157
<i>forever and ever.</i>

07:58.158 --> 08:00.159
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

08:00.160 --> 08:02.662
I can't close my eyes.
That's when my dad appears

08:02.663 --> 08:05.698
and tells me only losers
close their eyes.

08:05.699 --> 08:08.834
Sir, for the masses to rally
behind you for eternity,

08:08.835 --> 08:12.538
you must seek redemption
through the sinner's prayer.

08:12.539 --> 08:14.973
First things first,
kneel before the Lord.

08:14.974 --> 08:16.975
I'd love to, Mikey,
but I haven't really

08:16.976 --> 08:18.677
taken my knees out of the box yet.

08:18.678 --> 08:21.045
I'd hate to bring down
their value by using them.

08:21.046 --> 08:23.514
How do you tie your shoes, sir?

08:23.515 --> 08:26.351
I sort of put 'em on when
I was 26, and here we are.

08:26.718 --> 08:28.519
Time for Trump test one.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.688
Something you won't find
in your Torah

08:30.689 --> 08:35.491
is that humans have
Dominican over all animals.

08:35.994 --> 08:37.494
What the fuck?!

08:37.495 --> 08:39.443
- You have to kill the lion.
- What?!

08:39.479 --> 08:41.655
If you're gonna hang
with the Trumps, you need

08:41.657 --> 08:43.832
to routinely offend people
who think animals can emote.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.569
I'm already swimming in shit.

08:45.570 --> 08:48.472
I don't need to throw
a dead lion in the pool.

08:48.473 --> 08:50.507
<i>Can I take this costume off?</i>

08:50.508 --> 08:52.743
Just pee in the suit, Tillerson!

08:52.744 --> 08:55.911
<i>You people fired me.
Can't you just let me leave?</i>

09:53.033 --> 09:55.868
I'd dig a penny out of their
asses if they asked me to!

09:55.869 --> 09:57.637
And I see you brought
a bonus Trump.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.305
Yeah, we're breaking him
like a show pony.

09:59.306 --> 10:01.441
Don't pull any punches on
the hard-hitting journalism.

10:01.442 --> 10:02.907
Let's get to it.

10:02.908 --> 10:04.609
Don't you think it's strange
that we've never seen

10:04.610 --> 10:07.912
Robert Mueller and El Chapo in
the same place, the same time?

10:07.913 --> 10:10.649
Good point, Sean.
I mean, how can we trust a guy

10:10.650 --> 10:13.985
who, rumor has it,
breast-fed until he was 11?

10:13.986 --> 10:16.955
Yeah, Sean! Who stops
breast-feeding that early?

10:16.956 --> 10:19.790
What about you, Jared?
Doesn't Mueller's very act

10:19.791 --> 10:22.793
of investigating Trump
imply an anti-Trump bias?

10:22.794 --> 10:24.829
You know, actually, according
to legal statute ...

10:24.830 --> 10:26.163
- Ah ... dit, dit, dit, dit!
- Well, duh-duh ...

10:26.164 --> 10:27.665
"Actually, according
to legal statute..."

10:27.666 --> 10:28.999
- Shut up!
- Okay, four-eyes!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.769
Jared, I fucking believe in you,
you fucking idiot.

10:31.770 --> 10:34.572
Yeah! You're our brother because
you have sex with our sister!

10:34.573 --> 10:37.974
Sign in, Jared.
And add friend!

10:37.975 --> 10:41.778
Another Trump?!
This is the happiest day of my life

10:41.779 --> 10:44.414
since everybody else here
got fired for cause

10:44.415 --> 10:46.416
and I became the
last best white guy.

10:46.417 --> 10:47.984
Come on, Jared!

10:47.985 --> 10:50.152
I didn't tape your foreskin
back on for nothing.

10:50.153 --> 10:53.522
All right. Fine.
U-Uh, Robert Mueller is a ...

10:53.523 --> 10:56.458
a Muslim Mexican
sponsored by the deep state

10:56.459 --> 11:01.395
to convert Americans into...
transgendered... bathrooms?

11:01.931 --> 11:03.599
- Whoo! There it is!
- Yeah! Awesome, Jared!

11:03.600 --> 11:05.467
That's how you play ball, Jared!

11:05.468 --> 11:08.637
Tonight, my website is
offering you free shipping.

11:08.638 --> 11:11.138
Jared, throw your buddy
that promo code.

11:11.139 --> 11:13.173
I need a flirty look for spring.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.909
The time has come, Mr. President.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.443
Your flock awaits.

11:19.444 --> 11:21.078
- Ted Cruuuuz!
- Aaaah!

11:21.079 --> 11:23.080
This event's a great opportunity

11:23.081 --> 11:25.816
for me to show my piety to the Lord!

11:25.817 --> 11:27.784
But mostly to convince Texans

11:27.785 --> 11:30.486
to catatonically keep me in the Senate.

11:30.487 --> 11:34.357
Donald, fellowship with the
eternal is an intimate act,

11:34.358 --> 11:38.695
and you should never feel the
need to show off in any way.

11:41.098 --> 11:43.767
...sanctified in the name of Christ!

11:51.140 --> 11:53.125
Brothers and sisters,

11:53.126 --> 11:55.110
I once was in the gutter,

11:55.111 --> 11:58.313
stricken with countless
eradicated diseases.

11:58.314 --> 12:00.182
Then one day, a man

12:00.183 --> 12:03.785
by the name of the Reverend
Dr. Donald J. Trump,

12:03.786 --> 12:06.788
hallelujah,
grabbed me by my thong!

12:06.789 --> 12:09.824
Hallelujah!
And wedgied me into the light!

12:09.825 --> 12:13.962
He has saved us! Hallelujah!
Ted Cruz!

12:17.132 --> 12:19.967
Don't believe the dishonest media.

12:19.968 --> 12:22.469
I would never cut off God's penis.

12:22.470 --> 12:27.540
Unless God begged me like,
"Please, son! Slice off my dong!"

12:27.541 --> 12:29.142
<i>Trump! Trump! Trump!</i>

12:29.143 --> 12:31.411
<i>Trump! Trump! Trump!</i>

12:31.412 --> 12:32.846
They love me.

12:32.847 --> 12:35.982
I'm like Jesus, only with
twice as many prostitutes.

12:35.983 --> 12:37.583
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Kumbaya!

12:37.584 --> 12:39.384
Freedom! Liberty!

12:41.787 --> 12:45.591
Jared, I'm so excited
for your bro mitzvah.

12:45.592 --> 12:48.728
If your hair stays slicked back,
then you are officially a Trump

12:48.729 --> 12:50.096
and we can, like, hang and shit.

12:50.097 --> 12:52.364
But if your hair does not stay in place,

12:52.365 --> 12:55.266
then you go back to your
old life as a punk bitch.

12:55.267 --> 12:57.568
Come on, hair.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.204
Make sure
it gets to the root, Eric.

13:00.205 --> 13:01.506
Come on.

13:03.709 --> 13:05.910
- Yeah!
- Fuck you, Jared!

13:05.911 --> 13:07.211
- It stayed!
- Jared, you did it!

13:07.212 --> 13:09.447
You're not a friendless loser anymore!

13:09.548 --> 13:11.682
<i>Religion is amazing.</i>

13:11.683 --> 13:13.517
I was only gonna be
president for life,

13:13.518 --> 13:16.053
but now I'll soon be
savior for eternity!

13:16.054 --> 13:18.789
I'm glad the Lord brought you
a lasting peace in your heart.

13:18.790 --> 13:21.425
What are you talking
about? I haven't heard

13:21.426 --> 13:24.061
someone deify me in hours,
and I'm getting antsy.

13:24.062 --> 13:26.429
We could enshrine my humble
Christlike vision

13:26.430 --> 13:28.031
for this nation into eternal law?

13:28.032 --> 13:30.700
Done. Get me some blank
executive orders.

13:30.701 --> 13:32.635
Make sure they have
my new address on them.

13:34.872 --> 13:37.306
Jared, it's our prenuptially
obligated date night,

13:37.307 --> 13:39.075
but something feels hashtag different.

13:39.076 --> 13:40.910
Yeah, it does.
I'm pretty fly now, huh?

13:40.911 --> 13:42.611
You know, I just got
the bathroom attendant fired

13:42.612 --> 13:44.245
for not having any boysenberry Altoids.

13:44.246 --> 13:46.748
- Hey-yo!
- 'Sup, lesbos?

13:46.749 --> 13:48.283
Jared, what are my
brothers doing here?

13:48.284 --> 13:50.385
Babe, if there's gonna
be soosh in my boosh,

13:50.386 --> 13:53.989
it's my fedoosh
doot to dish it with my dudes!

13:53.990 --> 13:55.757
- How am I doing?
- Uh, what the fuck?

13:55.758 --> 13:57.926
I love you.
That was art!

13:57.927 --> 14:00.128
Hello?! Jared?
Date night!

14:00.129 --> 14:01.996
Change of plans, babe.
The boys are here.

14:01.997 --> 14:04.498
Fine.
I'm clicking to unsubscribe.

14:04.499 --> 14:07.134
And I'm not giving feedback.

14:07.135 --> 14:11.706
Whoo-hoo! Date night!
I'll have the rock shrimp tempura!

14:11.707 --> 14:16.210
Today, I've signed this stack
of executive orders

14:16.211 --> 14:20.046
to mold our country
into Christ's beautiful image.

14:20.047 --> 14:21.881
That guy knew
how to keep in shape.

14:21.882 --> 14:24.907
Effective immediately,
no federal funds will

14:24.942 --> 14:26.652
- go to Planned Parenthood.
- Love it.

14:26.653 --> 14:29.388
Bakeries may deny service
to men with torn jeans.

14:29.389 --> 14:32.559
- Amen.
- People who make eye contact

14:32.560 --> 14:34.060
with the camera on their ATM

14:34.061 --> 14:36.829
- will be investigated for prostitution.
- Great.

14:36.830 --> 14:39.631
And death is recommended
for the following crimes ...

14:39.632 --> 14:41.299
- women pumping their own gas...
- Unnatural.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.135
- ...eating meals out of order...
- Sure.

14:43.136 --> 14:46.205
- ...and divorce.
- Wait. What was that last one?

14:46.206 --> 14:47.973
Trump's new
fundamentalist policies

14:47.974 --> 14:50.008
have raised the ire of the nation,

14:50.009 --> 14:51.743
as Democrats fight back with an emoji

14:51.744 --> 14:53.544
of God giving a thumbs down.

14:53.545 --> 14:55.880
What ha... Who can...

14:55.881 --> 14:58.515
Hard ... You know, I ...
You can ...

14:58.516 --> 15:00.417
Wow.

15:00.418 --> 15:02.754
And now it's time for
Lawrence O'Donnell.

15:02.755 --> 15:05.589
And I love that mandate
requiring every public park

15:05.590 --> 15:08.825
to have an 80-foot animatronic
Jesus scissor-kicking the devil!

15:08.826 --> 15:11.394
Oh, that Jesus thinks he's so great.

15:11.395 --> 15:13.830
Oh, right ...
I'm into Jesus now.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.999
What did you do, Donald?
I had to cancel my

15:16.000 --> 15:18.835
half-birthday orgy thanks
to your stupid new policies.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.371
What am I supposed to do with
all those pentagram necklaces now?

15:21.372 --> 15:23.339
Maybe it's time you
started living your life

15:23.340 --> 15:25.408
according to God's principles, Nooch.

15:25.409 --> 15:27.943
I made that the law of the land.

15:27.944 --> 15:29.945
And now my people
can't get enough of me.

15:29.946 --> 15:33.082
Are you kidding me?
Money is the root of all evil,

15:33.083 --> 15:35.550
and I got a big root,
and I rub it on my money.

15:35.551 --> 15:37.977
That's a direct quote from you!

15:39.655 --> 15:42.024
<i>J-Dawg, you okay?</i>

15:42.025 --> 15:44.192
Did you just find out
the Lexus 2018 LS

15:44.193 --> 15:47.262
- doesn't come sunroof optional?
- It's Ivanka.

15:47.263 --> 15:50.131
She's not really, uh,
favoriting the new Jared.

15:50.132 --> 15:53.701
You don't need her, man!
Me and Don are like two Ivankas,

15:53.702 --> 15:55.636
except we're not allowed
to go swimming.

15:55.637 --> 15:57.638
In fact, let's have
a toast to your freedom.

15:57.639 --> 16:00.140
- Bartender, bring us 300 shots!
- Jesus!

16:00.141 --> 16:01.942
Don't you guys ever want a night in

16:01.943 --> 16:05.312
or, you know, to spend time
with your children?

16:05.313 --> 16:07.414
Nah, dude. My dad didn't
spend any time with me,

16:07.415 --> 16:08.816
and I turned out great.

16:08.817 --> 16:12.319
What the hell, bartender?!
Why are you ignoring me?!

16:12.320 --> 16:14.221
Why don't you like me?!

16:14.222 --> 16:18.090
Please just give me a hug, bartender!

16:18.391 --> 16:20.459
<i> Screw Mnuchin.</i>

16:20.460 --> 16:23.629
Embracing Christianity gave me
something even better ...

16:23.630 --> 16:26.065
the tender devotion of millions.

16:26.066 --> 16:28.251
So, when do we go visit the
people who scream my name

16:28.355 --> 16:31.670
- so hard, they throw up?
- Oh, today's just a quiet Bible study.

16:31.671 --> 16:33.072
Most of religion is just reading

16:33.073 --> 16:34.906
and then talking about the reading.

16:34.907 --> 16:36.842
And then repenting for reading.

16:36.843 --> 16:39.510
Let us open with a prayer.
Ben?

16:39.511 --> 16:43.315
Dear God, you're the tallest
being in all the land.

16:43.316 --> 16:46.584
You could probably
wink at airline pilots

16:46.585 --> 16:51.655
as if to say, "That's
some quality flying." Amen.

16:51.656 --> 16:53.523
Now do we talk about me?

16:53.524 --> 16:56.626
Religion isn't about
glorifying yourself, silly.

16:56.627 --> 16:59.129
It's about making yourself so small

16:59.130 --> 17:02.867
that you can snuggle up for
a nap in the Lord's pocket!

17:02.868 --> 17:05.202
Some might say this is
the only 45 minutes a week

17:05.203 --> 17:06.803
where we don't talk about you.

17:06.804 --> 17:09.372
Then what the hell do you
talk about? Carl Icahn?

17:09.373 --> 17:12.508
Feels like this J.C. sesh
is getting tense.

17:12.509 --> 17:15.044
So let me just say,
Mr. President, I love you.

17:15.045 --> 17:16.679
W-W-What are you talking about?

17:16.680 --> 17:20.148
God rewards displays of
vulnerability and intimacy.

17:20.150 --> 17:22.117
- Everyone, join in.
- I love your soul.

17:22.118 --> 17:25.387
- Our eternal love will never die.
- We are united as one with the Lord!

17:25.387 --> 17:27.955
<i>His is the light
that shines through us all.</i>

17:27.957 --> 17:30.292
<i>Let us anoint
ourselves in oil and embrace.</i>

17:30.293 --> 17:32.627
<i>Cradle us in your bosom.</i>

17:40.703 --> 17:42.503
<i>And the streets will run red</i>

17:42.504 --> 17:45.072
with their HPV-infected blood.

17:45.073 --> 17:46.673
So, happy Easter.

17:46.674 --> 17:49.310
Now I'd like to invite up
the most God-fearing president

17:49.311 --> 17:52.813
this country has ever known ...
Donald J. Trump!

17:52.814 --> 17:55.716
Ugh! Wow!
What a service, folks.

17:55.717 --> 17:58.519
It's so much better than
being in the Palladium Club

17:58.520 --> 18:01.687
watching Roy Cohn do blow off
every inch of Ed Koch.

18:01.688 --> 18:05.658
Anyway, open your stupid Bibles
and turn to the Jesus part.

18:07.028 --> 18:09.829
<i>Why have you
forsaken me, Donald?!</i>

18:09.830 --> 18:11.064
Who are you?!

18:11.065 --> 18:15.068
<i>I am your true Lord and Savior ...
a golf cart.</i>

18:15.069 --> 18:17.869
<i>How dare you worship Christian idols!</i>

18:17.870 --> 18:20.906
<i>Right now you could be
on your 39th hole,</i>

18:20.907 --> 18:23.842
<i>trying to ride me over a baby alligator.</i>

18:23.843 --> 18:25.344
God, that sounds so fun.

18:25.345 --> 18:27.279
No! Go away, devil!

18:34.786 --> 18:38.655
I was... just talking to my golf cart.

18:39.224 --> 18:41.259
<i>What's it sayin'?</i>

18:41.460 --> 18:44.429
Jared!
I'm worried about you!

18:44.430 --> 18:46.597
You got so drunk,
you missed Shabbat.

18:46.598 --> 18:49.033
You were flipping light
switches like it was a Tuesday.

18:49.034 --> 18:51.101
Yeah, I thought you
wanted me to have friends.

18:51.102 --> 18:54.104
Right now, my only option is
spending nights with your brothers,

18:54.105 --> 18:55.905
drunkenly changing White House
computer home pages

18:55.906 --> 18:57.540
to porn-dot websites.

18:57.541 --> 19:00.110
There's a reason I chose
not to marry my brothers.

19:00.111 --> 19:02.912
I miss my sweet, lonely Jared.

do you know where Jared is?</i>

19:11.455 --> 19:13.722
We haven't seen him since
his 30th shot last night.

19:13.723 --> 19:16.058
I haven't, but sometimes
I catch him crying

19:16.059 --> 19:18.660
- in the janitor's closet.
- Oh, great. We'll check there.

19:18.661 --> 19:21.464
Wait. Do you boys
want to hang out?

19:21.465 --> 19:23.732
Dad, I'm not gonna lie.
I've dreamt of you

19:23.733 --> 19:27.002
saying those words to me
literally my whole, entire life.

19:27.003 --> 19:29.137
But you're kind of a
lame-ass church dork now,

19:29.138 --> 19:31.139
so it didn't really live up to the hype.

19:31.140 --> 19:33.108
Why don't you just
throw out the Christ quilt

19:33.109 --> 19:35.743
- and get your sac back?
- I can't.

19:35.744 --> 19:37.078
If I lose those Christians,

19:37.079 --> 19:39.680
I'll lose their love
and this awful job I hate!

19:49.657 --> 19:52.192
Number five, imposing
worship requirements

19:52.193 --> 19:54.461
on our nation's Medicaid recipients.

19:54.462 --> 19:57.031
And later, the White House
Easter Egg Roll,

19:57.032 --> 19:58.764
which the President has promised

19:58.765 --> 20:02.268
to be the most confrontationally
Christian in history!

20:02.269 --> 20:04.837
Welcome, children-sized humans,

20:04.838 --> 20:06.539
to the White House Easter Egg Roll.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.607
And now my favorite Bible story.

20:08.608 --> 20:12.478
Elijah was going to Bethel,
and some children taunted him.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.880
"Go away, bald head!"
Elijah cursed them.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.015
Two bears charged
out of the underbrush

20:17.016 --> 20:21.885
and ripped them limb from limb!
42 children in all!

20:25.291 --> 20:27.225
Oh, great. This again.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.295
- Oh! Yeah!
- Come on, Tillerson.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.396
- Where are the eggs?
- Oh, man!

20:32.397 --> 20:34.731
Jared. Quick ... punch
this bunny in the dong.

20:34.732 --> 20:37.301
I need both my hands
to record it on my phone.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.470
Look. It's been fun
and pretty harrowing.

20:39.471 --> 20:42.473
But I just don't think I'm Trumpy
enough to hang with you guys.

20:42.474 --> 20:45.176
I-I promise I'll learn
to ride a bike soon!

20:45.177 --> 20:48.579
- A-And then we can go on day trips!
- Don't bother, Eric.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.913
Jared's exactly who we
always suspected he was ...

20:50.914 --> 20:53.216
a spoiled child of a disgraced
real-estate mogul

20:53.217 --> 20:55.685
with a total lack
of self-awareness.

20:55.686 --> 20:58.321
Sorry, babe. I know you
wanted me to have friends.

20:58.322 --> 21:00.390
You know, Jared, there's one thing

21:00.391 --> 21:05.428
my brothers value more than
themselves. Click to continue?

21:05.429 --> 21:09.731
<i>I want to die.
Rex Tillerson wants to die.</i>

21:09.932 --> 21:13.702
Yo, Pence, Daddy, I'm sick
of this religion crap!

21:13.703 --> 21:16.071
I want to go back to betting
on celebrity nipple sizes

21:16.072 --> 21:17.672
without the risk of stoning.

21:17.673 --> 21:19.874
So let's figure this shit out
once and for all.

21:19.875 --> 21:23.344
Which is the true religion ...
Christianity or Trumpianity?

21:23.345 --> 21:26.080
The Easter egg roll to end
all Easter egg rolls.

21:26.081 --> 21:29.917
If Christianity is the true religion,
Jesus will help Mike Pence win.

21:29.918 --> 21:32.520
But if it's Trumpianity ...
which it is ...

21:32.521 --> 21:35.923
- then my dad will help himself win.
- Are you in, Pence?

21:35.924 --> 21:39.127
Or are you scared your buddy
Jesus' free ride is over?

21:39.128 --> 21:41.794
I believe all competition
is a prideful sin.

21:41.795 --> 21:44.631
But when God presents me
with a trial, I must obey.

21:44.632 --> 21:47.498
Get all those kids out of here!
This could get ugly!

21:48.236 --> 21:50.903
Please, God, guide my egg
straight and true.

21:50.904 --> 21:54.073
Please, egg, don't tempt me
into eating you.

21:54.074 --> 21:56.109
<i>Drei, zwei, eins!</i>

21:56.110 --> 21:57.443
Go!

21:58.578 --> 22:01.913
N-o-o-o-o-o!

22:07.287 --> 22:09.288
<i>- God?
- Yes, my son.</i>

22:09.289 --> 22:10.889
<i>This game is not about winning.</i>

22:10.890 --> 22:13.792
<i>It is about putting your faith
in the power of Jesus ...</i>

22:13.793 --> 22:16.461
<i>- Aaaah!
- Winning proves your worth!</i>

22:16.462 --> 22:18.062
<i>Do what you would do!</i>

22:18.063 --> 22:20.265
<i>Go smash that loser's egg!</i>

22:20.266 --> 22:24.402
I can't cheat. My supporters
want a moral man.

22:24.403 --> 22:27.004
<i>They don't need you
to be moral, Donald.</i>

22:27.005 --> 22:29.740
<i>They just need you to appoint judges</i>

22:29.741 --> 22:33.777
<i>that pose with machine guns
in their Facebook photos.</i>

22:33.778 --> 22:35.944
But how am I going to get up?

22:36.347 --> 22:39.416
<i>- You might need God for that one.
- No chance, asshole!</i>

22:41.286 --> 22:45.088
Eeeeehhyyaa!

22:45.089 --> 22:47.791
Thanks, Jared. I'll take
the credit from here.

22:50.927 --> 22:53.095
I win! Yeah, baby!

22:53.096 --> 22:55.964
Who's the winner?
I am! Ha ha!

22:55.965 --> 22:58.133
- Whoo-hoo!
- Ah-oo! Yeah! Awesome!

23:01.305 --> 23:04.787
- Looks like you're a Trump after all.
- Rule numero uno ...

23:04.822 --> 23:06.941
make the dad
look good no matter what.

23:06.942 --> 23:08.310
Hey, we're gonna go dress up like

23:08.311 --> 23:11.145
super-realistic Arab dudes
and scare McMaster.

23:11.146 --> 23:13.682
- Are you coming?
- I can't keep up with you guys.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.350
Whenever it's time for your dad
to pardon family members,

23:15.351 --> 23:17.485
I am definitely a Trump.

23:17.486 --> 23:19.554
But until then,
I'm just gonna be Jared.

23:19.555 --> 23:23.691
You may not be our bro, but you're
definitely our brother-in-law.

23:23.692 --> 23:27.328
You know, folks,
I have to stop living like Jesus

23:27.329 --> 23:29.830
and go back to living like God ...

23:29.831 --> 23:32.999
lashing out in anger,
no matter how many people drown.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.736
That's why certain countries
have monsoon season.

23:35.737 --> 23:37.904
You people made me out
to be a Christ figure,

23:37.905 --> 23:39.972
but I'm more like
the opposite of Christ.

23:39.973 --> 23:42.742
You can call me, I don't know,
the anti-Christ.

23:42.743 --> 23:44.644
Oh, oh.
I like the sound of that.

23:44.645 --> 23:46.512
Happy Easter, kids!

23:46.513 --> 23:48.681
<i>I don't know what got into me.</i>

23:48.682 --> 23:50.516
I thought I was helping our country

23:50.517 --> 23:53.853
by bringing you closer to God.
But it turns out,

23:53.854 --> 23:56.255
that just makes it easier
for you to kill him.

23:56.256 --> 23:58.056
No kidding.
Why don't we discuss it

23:58.057 --> 24:00.259
over some stolen Easter candy?

24:00.260 --> 24:03.995
<i>- Why steal it? You're a rich man.
- How do you think I got so rich?</i>

24:03.996 --> 24:08.173
<i>Oh, wow. Now I see you
through a glass, darkly.</i>
