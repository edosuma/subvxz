I mean, I'm a dog.
I can't believe they don't hate me.

Well, I guess they haven't learned to yet.

Anyway, listen, thanks for fixing me up.
I should be heading home now.

Diggs, how much time
have you spent in kennels?

when I first got dropped off.

I guess he saw something in me
nobody else did.

gonna let him down.

wind up in the kennel again.

I just keep messing things up.

something to do with...

to save your life?

53:56.066 --> 53:58.442
But it's not like I don't
wanna follow orders.

53:58.610 --> 54:01.028
It's just, I learned pretty early on...

54:01.196 --> 54:05.491
...that the only one I could count on,
the only one I could really trust, was me.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.910
That way,
no one could ever let me down.

54:08.370 --> 54:10.287
