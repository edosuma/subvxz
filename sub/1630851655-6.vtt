WEBVTT

00:39.581 --> 00:42.500
Remember, Dad and I
are both working late tonight.

00:42.584 --> 00:47.213
Dinner's in the fridge,
350 for 20 minutes.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.800
You excited about that field trip today?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.510
ELLA'What a beautiful theater.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.554
I don't think
I've been back there since...

00:54.637 --> 00:56.723
Yeah, since we took you and Zoe
to see <i>Annie.</i>

00:57.432 --> 00:59.934
That was such a fun day.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.645
You two girls belting out "Tomorrow"
on the way home.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.484
And your dad went
and got those magic beans

01:07.567 --> 01:09.819
and put that awesome beanstalk
in the backyard.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.864
-I was listening.
-Oh, she speaks.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.075
It's a miracle.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.042
Oh, hey, there's Zoe now.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.668
-Mom, what are you--
-Wait, I...

01:26.169 --> 01:27.962
I was just gonna say hi.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.548
No. No, me and Zoe aren't friends anymore.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.300
Yes, I know you're not as close
as you used to be...

01:32.383 --> 01:34.052
We're not close, period.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.347
She's all about her clothes,
and the tennis team,

01:37.430 --> 01:39.265
and her amazing new bestie.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.648
Listen, I'm... I'm sure
that's just a phase and--

01:46.731 --> 01:48.108
I don't wanna be friends with her.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.861
I just...

01:51.945 --> 01:54.280
I don't know,
let's not talk about Zoe anymore.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.241
Okay, love you.

02:03.748 --> 02:07.001
MS.Okay, guys, listen up.
For your performance pieces,

02:07.085 --> 02:09.087
it can be a... poem,

02:09.796 --> 02:11.297
it can be a monologue.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.550
It can be a movement piece,

02:13.633 --> 02:15.844
just so long as it's about you.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.305
I want you to lay your souls bare.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.266
MS.Okay?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.476
Now, for today's field trip.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.813
As theaters go,
the Fox is hallowed ground.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.315
So, I expect everyone
to be on their best behavior.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.943
I'm gonna do
an interpretive dance about Alan.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.404
That's my tortoise.
I named him after Alan Turing,

02:34.487 --> 02:35.989
you know, like the father of AI.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.616
My Alan's smart,
but not like Alan Turing smart, obvi.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.869
Do you have pets?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.831
-I have a dog.
-MS.Ella and Sydney?

02:45.874 --> 02:47.417
Do you mind chatting some other time?

02:47.500 --> 02:48.626
Oh, not at all.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.629
MS.Um, okay.
Off to the buses, everybody.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.766
Um, Ms. Cornish?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.186
I was wondering if I could write something

03:06.269 --> 03:07.520
-and submit it to you--
-Uh-uh.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.272
This is a performance class.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.899
Everybody performs.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.526
Off to the buses.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.236
Come on.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.491
Every architectural detail

03:20.575 --> 03:24.662
was painstakingly recreated
after the fire of '38.

03:24.746 --> 03:29.375
All based on the original blueprints
which, if you care to see,

03:29.459 --> 03:32.754
are on display in the upstairs lounge.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.631
-So boring.
-Sadly, the fire claimed

03:34.714 --> 03:36.049
the lives of an acting troupe

03:36.132 --> 03:37.425
that was rehearsing at the time.

03:37.508 --> 03:40.929
Behind me, you'll see a tribute
to their memories.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.264
-Ella's been staring.
-Speaking of which,

03:43.348 --> 03:46.601
who here likes ghost stories?

03:47.185 --> 03:48.770
If you join me in the theater,

03:48.853 --> 03:52.815
I'll tell you a ghost story
that will make you shake in your shorts.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.322
She keeps staring.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.157
It's rude to stare.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.492
I wasn't staring.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.743
Kinda were.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.371
But I wasn't, I was just looking
at something behind you.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.164
What? Was it a ghost?

04:12.710 --> 04:15.838
It's said the spirits
of these dead thespians

04:15.922 --> 04:18.174
haunt the theater to this day.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.761
Legend has it,
they're looking to pluck the living

04:21.844 --> 04:25.390
and drag them
into their phantasmal acting troupe...

04:26.432 --> 04:27.684
forever.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.813
Late at night,
their wailing can be heard emanating

04:31.896 --> 04:34.399
from this very stage.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.777
During a 2014 production of <i>The Music Man</i>,

04:37.860 --> 04:40.780
the lead actor was so spooked,
he quit the show.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.448
I won't divulge his name.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.868
But it rhymes with Keil Datrick Tarris.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.290
TOUR GUIDE
Could that be them now?

04:53.251 --> 04:56.337
Oh, and what's this?

04:56.921 --> 04:58.715
<i>Unfinished Business</i>?

04:58.798 --> 05:01.092
Why, that's the play they were rehearsing.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.762
It appears the ghosts
wanna hold auditions.

05:05.972 --> 05:12.353
Who among you is brave enough
to risk winning an otherworldly role?

05:13.438 --> 05:16.774
The young lady down front and...

05:17.317 --> 05:18.443
you in the back.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.861
Why don't you join us?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.781
Um, I, I have to go to the bathroom.

05:23.865 --> 05:24.907
I'm sorry, I can't.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.455
Keep it together, Ella. Keep it together.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.185
-MS.Keep moving!

05:52.268 --> 05:53.728
Hey, stop fighting!

05:53.811 --> 05:55.605
-Sam and Noah, really? Come on.
-She said what?

05:57.690 --> 05:58.983
Stop fighting!

06:52.286 --> 06:55.289
-Come on. Come on.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.148
Hello?

07:21.357 --> 07:22.567
Hello?

07:32.076 --> 07:35.079
Sorry, excuse me,
I was on a field trip when I got lost.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.334
What on earth is that racket?

08:21.417 --> 08:22.793
We have a visitor.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.462
It's a girl.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.713
I'll say.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.215
Can she see us?

08:27.298 --> 08:28.925
Of course, she can see us.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.052
Why else would she be terrified?

08:31.802 --> 08:33.137
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.931
This isn't happening.
This is a dream. Please be a dream.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.016
You can see us, can't you?

08:37.975 --> 08:40.353
A bit of a mumble mouth,
isn't she?

08:40.436 --> 08:41.687
No worries.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.232
We'll have her transformed in no time.

08:44.857 --> 08:48.236
No. No, please, please, please,
do not turn me into a ghost, please.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.697
I meant transform you into an actor.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.741
You see? That tour guide.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.245
Always making us out to be
the phantoms of this forsaken opera.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.081
We're dead, sweetie.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.250
But we're not scary, really.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.334
I'm Rosie.

09:04.126 --> 09:07.004
That's Vivian, and...

09:07.088 --> 09:09.090
Raymond... hi.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.550
Hi.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.805
I suppose I... need no introduction.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.977
Uh...

09:21.060 --> 09:22.603
Oscar Anderson.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.149
Oscar was in a bunch of movies
before they had sound.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.526
Or decent actors.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.488
What'cha doing here all alone?

09:33.030 --> 09:35.908
Um, I'm not sure. I, um...

09:36.701 --> 09:39.245
I was, I was scrolling through TikTok,

09:39.328 --> 09:41.372
and, and then
I was listening to a podcast.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.166
I don't know,
I, I must have fallen asleep.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.877
I mean, now my phone's dead,
and I don't have an adapter

09:46.961 --> 09:48.254
so I can't reach anyone but...

09:49.380 --> 09:50.756
Anyone follow that?

09:51.507 --> 09:52.967
I heard "phone".

09:53.050 --> 09:54.343
Wait a minute.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.388
You...

09:58.889 --> 10:00.057
I recognize you.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.100
Yeah.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.060
Yeah. You're, you're those actors.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.480
The ones that died in the fire.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.359
Yeah, we're them.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.404
What's your name?

10:14.363 --> 10:15.573
Ella.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.824
Ella.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.410
Well, tonight, you're Agnes.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.120
Someone find her a script.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.373
Eighty-two years stuck in limbo
and we finally have a full cast.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.792
We can rehearse our show
the way it was meant to be rehearsed.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.086
Here she goes. Stand back.

10:29.170 --> 10:33.257
As actors, we are heirs
to a sacred tradition begun by the Greeks,

10:33.341 --> 10:36.385
handed down to Shakespeare,
and entrusted to us.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.388
"The show must go on"
isn't merely an expression,

10:39.472 --> 10:42.850
but a promise that
we will persist in even the most...

10:44.935 --> 10:46.020
Hello?

10:46.103 --> 10:48.481
It's everyone. They say we get it.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.819
We're getting married
this weekend in Tahiti.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.696
Well, it's about time.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.032
You've been together a whole week.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.368
Do I detect a note of jealousy?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.290
-Do I detect a note of jealousy?
-Oh, um...

11:06.374 --> 11:08.209
Can't we all please stop fighting?

11:08.292 --> 11:09.919
No!

11:10.002 --> 11:11.420
Bigger!

11:11.504 --> 11:15.216
They have to hear you
in the nosebleeds. Again.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.596
Can't we all please stop fighting?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.598
No, you stand up straight.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.808
I...

11:23.891 --> 11:25.476
Oh, forget it.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.061
I'll show you.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.647
Viv, what are you...

11:32.692 --> 11:35.528
-You want to project like so.
-<i>You want to project like so.</i>

11:35.611 --> 11:38.864
-Can't we all please...
-<i>Can't we all please...</i>

11:39.949 --> 11:41.659
I don't want to.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.954
-Don't fight it, dear.
-<i>Don't fight it, dear.</i>

11:45.955 --> 11:48.082
-Can you please stop this...
-Viv!

11:48.165 --> 11:49.875
Leave the girl be!

11:51.585 --> 11:52.712
-Fine.
-<i>Fine.</i>

11:59.218 --> 12:00.344
Well?

12:01.095 --> 12:02.179
Go on.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.643
Can't we all please stop fighting?

12:07.727 --> 12:08.686
I don't...

12:08.769 --> 12:11.313
-I'm not an actor.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.527
It can't be.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.530
-What's happening?

12:20.823 --> 12:22.116
Run!

12:31.000 --> 12:31.917
Ella!

12:36.964 --> 12:38.507
It's been decades.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.760
I thought we were done with it.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.928
Done with what? What is that?

12:43.012 --> 12:44.305
We call it "The Critic."

12:44.388 --> 12:46.724
Because only a critic could be so cruel.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.977
I can't believe it's back.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.354
Probably couldn't bear
another minute of Oscar's overacting.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.315
But why tonight?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.238
Think it's because of me?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.496
That's the only explanation.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.081
We've got to get her out of here.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.500
How? The doors are locked.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.419
There must be some other way
out of this old firetrap.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.338
Does this place have a basement?

13:18.839 --> 13:20.341
You've been here 80 years,

13:20.424 --> 13:22.593
and you don't know
if this place has a basement?

13:22.676 --> 13:24.136
Yeah, we don't do much exploring.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.514
We're actors, not architects.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.058
Architects.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.769
There's got to be a way out somewhere.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.897
I have an idea.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.320
You have a hairpin?
You could try to pick the lock.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.488
Sure,

13:42.571 --> 13:44.824
or there's... that.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.207
"Use in case of emergency."

13:53.833 --> 13:55.584
You're trapped with a bunch of ghosts,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.671
and a demon skull
could show up any minute.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.756
I'd say it's an emergency.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.938
That was actually kinda fun.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.940
Great swing, Ella.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.191
Very powerful.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.693
Easy, tiger.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.364
Well, surely
you've seen some of my films.

14:25.447 --> 14:29.535
<i>The Pastor Plays Pinochle</i>
or my turn as a farmer in <i>Do Re Moo.</i>

14:31.036 --> 14:32.413
Don't worry, dear.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.416
Nobody saw them back then either.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.712
You never met a line
you didn't butcher.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.963
You chew up so much scenery,

14:41.046 --> 14:42.715
-it's a wonder you still have teeth.
-Oh, hey.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.759
There's a door down here
that looks like it leads to a fire escape.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.261
Have they always been like that?

14:47.344 --> 14:49.305
Every night for 83 years.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.807
This is nothing.
You should have seen Vivian in her heyday.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.601
Boy, she could rip you to shreds.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.935
There was a girl in our troupe.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.979
Vivian made her cry almost every day.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.105
How come?

14:58.188 --> 15:00.232
Vivian said it was
'cause she wasn't a good actress.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.568
But between you and me,
I think she was jealous.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.695
-Hmm.
-Yes, you have. You have...

15:04.778 --> 15:06.113
There's the door.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.198
What happened?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.159
Vivian kicked her out
the night of the fire.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.620
Funny thing is,
she ended up saving her life.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.871
You kinda remind me of her.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.498
Her name was Dolores Fiotakis.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.667
-Dolores Fiotakis?
-I heard that.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.880
How dare you mention
that conniver's name in my presence.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.008
That frivolous flapper
couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.719
-She was a joke.
-Viv, it's not her fault.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.231
Uh-oh.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.230
"Please, stop."

16:22.606 --> 16:24.149
What does it want us to stop?

16:24.233 --> 16:25.943
You mean besides Vivian's acting?

16:26.026 --> 16:27.361
Oh, that's rich.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.780
Coming from a C-list Valentino
such as you?

16:29.863 --> 16:31.365
-C-list? I'm one of the great actors of--
-Yes.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.326
-Tell me all about your list.
-Oh, put a sock in it, you two!

16:37.705 --> 16:38.956
Don't worry, honey.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.792
If there's a way out of here,
we'll find it.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.461
We best split up.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.589
Um, me and Ella could go together?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.675
Um, mm-hm.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.469
Then when I was seven,
I played Little Jimmy in a production

16:52.553 --> 16:54.513
of <i>Here Comes Big Jimmy</i> at the Fontaine.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.099
But we closed after two performances.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.394
It wasn't all bad, though,
'cause that's where I met Teddy.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.854
He was one of the other kids.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.981
Me and him became best friends.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.983
We did everything together after that.

17:06.066 --> 17:09.236
Told each other jokes, secrets,
got into all kinds of trouble.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.904
We were like brothers, you know?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.239
He's probably a...

17:13.407 --> 17:14.992
ghost, by now.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.750
I had a friend like that.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.587
We met in elementary school.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.340
My mom said it was like
we both found our twin.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.844
We did everything together,

17:33.927 --> 17:36.138
but our favorite thing to do was sing.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.306
You sing?

17:38.807 --> 17:40.517
I mean, I...

17:40.601 --> 17:42.561
I sing just for fun sometimes.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.565
Me and Zoe started out
singing old musicals.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.736
When we got older, we eventually
just started writing our own songs.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.406
They were whatever at first, but...

17:56.158 --> 17:58.869
they were starting to get...
pretty good, actually.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.001
And then everything changed.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.002
How?

18:12.216 --> 18:14.885
Zoe didn't wanna hang out as much anymore.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.139
She had her new friends.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.558
So, I, uh...

18:22.559 --> 18:25.104
I wrote a song about
how much I missed her,

18:25.813 --> 18:28.982
and I recorded myself singing it,
and I sent it to her.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.698
And then the next day,
I walked into school,

18:36.782 --> 18:39.368
and I saw Zoe and all of her friends.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.079
She was showing them my video.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.793
They were all just laughing at me.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.461
I mean...

18:50.796 --> 18:52.256
I wanna move on.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.052
I wanna make new friends,
but it feels like I'm just,

18:57.136 --> 18:59.096
like I'm stuck in a sort of, um...

18:59.179 --> 19:00.430
Limbo.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.348
Yeah.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.892
I used to beat myself up

19:03.976 --> 19:06.854
if I missed a cue or messed up a line.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.897
I'd go off and sulk.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.150
But Dolores?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.485
She set me straight.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.695
Dolores...

19:16.029 --> 19:17.781
That's the one that Vivian...

19:17.865 --> 19:19.533
Kicked out, yeah.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.538
Can I hear one of your songs?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.374
Oh, um...

19:29.251 --> 19:30.627
Please?

19:35.799 --> 19:36.800
Okay.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.235
Wow.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.536
What's wrong?

20:05.579 --> 20:07.539
There's something I need to show you.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.717
When did you find it?

20:23.305 --> 20:25.224
You always knew it was here, didn't you?

20:25.307 --> 20:26.475
It's just...

20:28.435 --> 20:30.062
It's been a long time

20:30.145 --> 20:32.648
since I got to talk
to somebody my own age.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.444
-I'm, I'm sorry, I shouldn't--
-Don't be.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.489
It's fine, really.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.367
I'm glad we had time to talk.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.452
I'll go get the others.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.454
Okay.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.113
Boy, are we gonna miss you.

21:21.196 --> 21:23.073
Promise you'll come back and visit?

21:23.782 --> 21:26.493
-I promise.
-And soon.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.996
We can't properly rehearse
without an Agnes.

21:29.079 --> 21:33.834
Tonight, with you, all of you, I've...

21:35.127 --> 21:37.337
I've felt more like I used to.

21:38.046 --> 21:38.922
Like me.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.009
Thank you.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.845
You're shameless.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.472
Stop trying to upstage her, you ham.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.814
Hurry, dear. Go.

22:10.912 --> 22:11.872
What?

22:12.831 --> 22:14.291
What do you want?

22:19.796 --> 22:21.506
Dolores.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.434
-- Honey, run!
-- Quick, run!

22:32.517 --> 22:33.810
It's coming back!

22:33.894 --> 22:36.563
-Run!

22:40.692 --> 22:41.693
Ella!

22:43.403 --> 22:45.655
So many regrets!

22:45.739 --> 22:48.450
So many things left unsaid!

22:48.533 --> 22:49.659
I have something I need to--

22:49.743 --> 22:53.205
Milking your big death scene
for the second time, I see.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.457
Oh, let's talk about milking!

22:55.540 --> 22:56.666
Can I please just tell you--

22:56.750 --> 23:00.170
Your soliloquy in Susquehanna,
that was milking!

23:00.253 --> 23:02.297
Will you just shut up for one second?

23:04.216 --> 23:06.426
That they heard in the nosebleeds.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.677
I know who The Critic is.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.971
"Please, stop.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.015
Can't we all please stop fighting?"

23:12.099 --> 23:14.226
It's an Agnes line from the play.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.936
Dolores's line.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.981
She was here during the fire,
and ever since.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.776
The Critic is Dolores Fiotakis?

23:22.859 --> 23:24.653
But why would she come back now?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.196
I was playing her part.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.280
That's no surprise.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.866
She was a demon on Earth, too.

23:29.950 --> 23:30.826
Was she?

23:30.909 --> 23:35.122
Dolores wasn't a demon,
she was a sweetheart.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.957
And you hated her.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.875
Perhaps I wasn't as kind

23:38.959 --> 23:41.336
-as I could have been. I--
-Oh, stop, Viv!

23:41.420 --> 23:42.838
You were threatened!

23:42.921 --> 23:44.256
It's not too late.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.174
You can tell her you're sorry.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.553
Excuse me?

23:49.636 --> 23:50.637
Dolores?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.018
Can you please let them down?

24:19.624 --> 24:22.210
Hi, Dolores.

24:28.341 --> 24:33.513
Viv, why don't you take it from here?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.098
-No, no, no.
-Great idea.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.933
-It's about time.
-Go ahead.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.105
I'm sorry.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.108
Uh, Viv?

24:45.192 --> 24:47.527
They need to hear you in the nosebleeds.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.489
Try it again.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.204
This may come as a shock, Dolores.

24:58.580 --> 25:03.502
But even though I'm an actor,
I have insecurities.

25:03.877 --> 25:08.340
I saw someone young and talented
with a bright future.

25:10.717 --> 25:11.718
Made me jealous.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.598
So, I took it out on you by being cruel.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.477
For that, I'm truly sorry.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.817
You deserved better from all of us.

25:27.901 --> 25:31.321
I should have been there for you
like you were there for me.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.449
Dolores, I...

25:34.533 --> 25:36.076
I knew you were suffering.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.037
And I did nothing.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.205
I'm sorry.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.961
No, no!

25:46.753 --> 25:50.632
Dolores, you're hurt and angry.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.967
Look, I get it.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.803
I really, really get it.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.179
I've been there,

25:56.263 --> 25:58.807
but sometimes you gotta
make peace with people,

26:01.393 --> 26:02.894
with the past.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.438
And start thinking about what's next.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.441
Otherwise, you'll just stay
stuck in one place...

26:12.821 --> 26:13.905
forever.

26:29.629 --> 26:30.964
Hi, Dolores.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.471
It's great to see you.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.473
It's great to see you, too.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.227
All of you.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.896
Gosh...

26:46.980 --> 26:50.650
It feels good to let go of... that.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.361
I'm sorry about tonight.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.905
You taking my role, it...

26:57.824 --> 27:00.368
I guess my demons got the best of me.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.871
I've been there.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.752
You really were quite terrifying, Dolores.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.462
Sublime performance.

27:11.755 --> 27:12.756
Oh, speaking of.

27:12.839 --> 27:16.676
Can't help but think,
we finally have a full cast again.

27:20.513 --> 27:22.682
We're through, Martin.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.310
You hear me?

27:25.393 --> 27:27.896
It appears
I have an extra ticket to Tahiti.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.649
-Know anyone who might be interested?
-Oh, hmm.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.151
I do.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.029
I do.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.665
Bravo.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.874
Whoo!

28:12.232 --> 28:15.443
MS.<i>Okay, class.
We have Ella's performance up next.</i>

28:55.692 --> 28:59.404
They say that friends are for a reason,

28:59.487 --> 29:02.699
a season, or a lifetime.
