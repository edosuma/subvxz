00:29.290 --> 00:31.248
[John Sheppard]
In a post-apocalyptic world,

00:31.292 --> 00:34.643
two warring vampire factions
have taken over the world,

00:35.600 --> 00:40.040
and only a few pockets
of surviving humans remain.

00:41.606 --> 00:45.784
Both humans and vampires
are on the brink of extinction.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.862

01:39.142 --> 01:40.796
- [wife moans]
- [farmer] Who are you?

01:41.666 --> 01:43.451
- Let her go!
- [wife crying]

01:43.494 --> 01:46.149
You need to leave
my property now!

01:47.759 --> 01:49.805
Leave this property,
I'm tellin' ya.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.242
Get back.
I'm warning you!

01:52.286 --> 01:54.462
[wife sobbing]

01:54.505 --> 01:56.420
If you run now,
I'll let you live.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.901
- What?
- She's going to die,
no matter what.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.643
Do you think you can save her?

02:02.252 --> 02:05.081
God will damn you
forever for this.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.952
[laughs]

- [flesh squelches]
- [screams]

02:18.225 --> 02:19.617
You should thank me.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.228
[chuckles]

02:21.271 --> 02:23.273
I'm taking you away
from all of this.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.753
[flesh squelches]

02:24.796 --> 02:26.668
- [woman screams]
- [farmer chokes]

02:36.808 --> 02:39.681
Drain her.
But leave this one alone.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.423
I want him to turn.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.515
- [drifter 1] Aw, shit.
- [drifter 2] What is it?

02:47.558 --> 02:49.908
- That's not good.
- What?

02:49.952 --> 02:51.780
I think they're vampires.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.608
You best step back
away from the window.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.436
[sighs] Alright man,
what are we gonna do?

02:55.479 --> 02:57.307
Back away from the window.
That's what we're gonna do!

02:57.351 --> 02:59.483
Come on, man. Get serious,
man. They're gonna
get killed down there.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.704
And we can do what?
Best thing we could do
is not get killed with them!

03:02.747 --> 03:05.489
Are you serious?
Man, these people
have been good to us.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.622
Look, man, we have
to do somethin'.
We can't just stand--

03:07.665 --> 03:09.406
What do you
want us to do?

03:09.450 --> 03:10.886
[sighs] Fuck.

03:13.802 --> 03:14.890
Fuck!

03:16.065 --> 03:17.588
[sighs] I think
he saw me.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.856
[tense music playing]

03:39.654 --> 03:42.961
Like a shepherd,
I must tend to my flock!

- [chuckles]
- [drifter groans]

04:03.547 --> 04:05.419
You belong to me now.

04:05.462 --> 04:09.205
Fuck you. I'll never
belong to you! Ever!

04:09.249 --> 04:11.555
- Well, you have no choice.
- [body clunks]

04:11.599 --> 04:13.209

04:20.651 --> 04:22.000
And what of you?

04:22.044 --> 04:23.219
[stammers]

04:25.177 --> 04:26.353
I'll-- I'll join you.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.965
No will to live.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.098
I have no need for you.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.704
[vampire] We shall feed!

07:28.143 --> 07:29.884
Well, don't just
stand there! Get him!

[thuds]

07:36.543 --> 07:38.196
[vampire snarls]

07:39.502 --> 07:42.070
Hey dude, you gotta
get me outta here.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.898
Son, you got
bigger problems.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.552
- What do you mean?
- You've been bit.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.118
- Wha--
- You're already dead, man.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.990
[groans, pants]

07:49.033 --> 07:50.165
No...

[gun clacks]

08:08.052 --> 08:09.837
[breathes heavily]

08:12.666 --> 08:14.189
I wasn't stealing anything,

08:14.232 --> 08:16.496
I was just looking
for something to trade.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.457
You're a worse liar
than you are a thief.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.980
Stand up, real slow.

08:30.684 --> 08:31.685
The woman.

08:32.642 --> 08:33.948
You didn't think
to bury her?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.166
[blood drips]

08:35.950 --> 08:38.996
That's my mother.
My-my adopted mother.

08:40.171 --> 08:43.697
I wanted to bury her,
but if I did,
they would come back.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.047
They'll know somebody survived
and come looking for me.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.049
If they do,

08:49.137 --> 08:50.530
they'll find two of us.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.230
[ominous music plays]

08:56.971 --> 08:58.625
Oh. Oh, my God.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.458
[pants]

09:15.772 --> 09:18.035
People are coming.
I think they're vampires.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.124
- Hurry, back door!
- Okay, come on, everyone.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.299
Quickly, this way.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.650
- Hurry!
- Hurry, hurry!

09:23.693 --> 09:24.825
- That's it.
- Come on, come on!

09:30.091 --> 09:32.659
[footsteps approach]

09:37.794 --> 09:39.666
Who are you
and what do you want?

09:40.971 --> 09:43.408
What do you think I want?

09:43.452 --> 09:47.282
Your total obedience
for a start.

09:47.325 --> 09:50.807
Now, where are
the others?

09:50.851 --> 09:53.157
- I don't know what you mean.
- You're lying to us!

09:53.201 --> 09:55.464
Your kind always lies.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.858
And it always ends
the same way.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.295
Where are the rest?

10:00.338 --> 10:01.513
There's only us here.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.778
Do I have to pluck out
an eyeball

10:04.821 --> 10:08.129
to get an honest answer
from you, vermin?

10:08.172 --> 10:13.177
Maybe she will be more truthful
when she is watching you suffer!

10:14.265 --> 10:16.616
[metal objects clatter]

10:19.531 --> 10:21.185
[women whine]

10:25.146 --> 10:29.585
We know there are others.
I can smell them.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.283
- They may be close by.
- I'll go look.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.677
There can't be many places
to hide around here.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.505
- No.
- Shh.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.767
[grunts]

10:37.811 --> 10:41.597
[women screaming]

10:43.860 --> 10:45.253
[man] We'll be okay!

10:45.296 --> 10:46.776
[Destias] Here they are,
my lord.

10:46.820 --> 10:50.824
Retreating like cockroaches
into the darkest corner.

10:50.867 --> 10:54.654
[villagers sobbing, crying]

11:00.007 --> 11:01.878
[chuckles]

11:01.922 --> 11:05.186
I have faith.
Faith that will protect me
and these people.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.058
[gasps]

11:13.847 --> 11:16.545
[groans, growls]

11:17.198 --> 11:21.637
The son of man has no place
to rest his head.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.726
- [cross snaps]
- [screams]

11:23.770 --> 11:26.163
God has failed you.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.774
I still believe.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.733
Which one is to be first?

11:32.082 --> 11:33.954
You! Big man!

11:34.606 --> 11:35.738
What of you?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.657
[women sobbing]

11:44.138 --> 11:45.139
[woman] No!

11:48.882 --> 11:50.492
[low growl]

11:50.535 --> 11:54.452
Big man. Big faith.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.239
You will never be strong enough
to become one of us.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.023

[pants]

12:12.862 --> 12:14.037
Silent!

12:16.170 --> 12:17.214
All of you.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.348
Weak! Worth nothing

12:21.871 --> 12:23.307
but feeding upon.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.270
[snarls]

12:29.313 --> 12:32.229

- [women whining]

12:35.102 --> 12:36.103
[shushes]

12:39.628 --> 12:42.762
Take him.
But save the others.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.242
We will need to ration.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.940
Thank you, my lord.

12:47.897 --> 12:51.074
Now, it's time to feast,

12:51.118 --> 12:54.425
and rid the world
of one more waste of oxygen.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.862
Yes, my love.

12:55.905 --> 12:59.648
- [Destias roars]
- [women scream]

13:09.353 --> 13:12.487
Hey, you still believe
in all this stuff?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.445
Even after everything
that's been happening?

13:18.754 --> 13:20.277
You got somethin' better?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.411
We must endure.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.543
Therefore,
we must believe.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.459
What did she prefer
to be known as?

13:28.503 --> 13:29.983
- Huh?
- Your mother.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.508
Margaret? Or Maggie?

13:33.551 --> 13:35.162
I found her ID.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.992
Uh... Maggie, I mean,

13:39.993 --> 13:41.516
I guess Margaret's
more appropriate.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.562
If you're gonna be
a good liar,

13:45.302 --> 13:46.956
you better recognize
who's lyin' to you.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.219
She's not your mother,
is she?

13:51.700 --> 13:53.136
[Charlie] Hey, are we leavin'?

13:53.180 --> 13:54.703
Time to move.

13:54.746 --> 13:55.965
But it's hot out there.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.054
No point in staying here.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.840
Zero transportation.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.668
The horses are dead,
the tractor's dry.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.585
I got a bicycle.
I can ride ahead
and get us some supplies.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.500
Good. Go on, then.

14:16.029 --> 14:19.119
You! Put your hands up
in the air and down
on your knees!

14:21.164 --> 14:23.079
Hey, hey, hey!
Look what I found!

14:23.993 --> 14:25.255
[chuckles] You like it?

14:25.821 --> 14:27.649
So they made you
sheriff, huh?

14:27.692 --> 14:30.782
Yup! Whole town voted.
Unanimous.

14:30.826 --> 14:34.134
Let me guess.
You were the only one
available for the job.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.092
[chuckles] Yeah.
Why you have to ruin it?

14:36.136 --> 14:38.660
Get out. I'm drivin'.

14:38.703 --> 14:39.922
Oh, man.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.533
[car chiming]

14:50.193 --> 14:53.153
- You did good. Windows up.
- What? We're gonna melt!

14:53.196 --> 14:56.330
Windows down creates drag.
We lose mileage.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.767
It's gonna be hot,
but it beats walkin'.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.248
Did you find any guns?

15:02.205 --> 15:03.728
No. No guns.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.295
Did you check the station?

15:05.339 --> 15:06.470
Didn't find it.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.300
- Hold on.
- [engine starts]

15:10.344 --> 15:11.954
[windows hum]

15:13.390 --> 15:14.783
[tires screech]

15:19.527 --> 15:21.442
[Charlie] Why are we
creepin' around here?

15:21.485 --> 15:23.139
[John] Just takin'
a look around.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.403
[Charlie] Yeah,
but if there was anybody here,
they'll be dead.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.972
[John] That means the Master
could've been here before us.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.197
Stay here.
Keep the doors locked.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.503
What? What am I, eight?

15:41.114 --> 15:42.158
You hear me?

15:51.298 --> 15:55.215
[brooding music playing]

16:04.702 --> 16:06.008
[flies buzz]

16:09.838 --> 16:10.926
[woman] He's dead!

16:13.581 --> 16:14.843
Did you shoot him?

16:14.886 --> 16:15.844
Yep.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.846
What about her?

16:17.889 --> 16:19.195
Shot her too.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.110
Seems like you can
take care of yourself.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.372
I get by.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.730
- Did you see any others lately?
- Nope.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.646
Well, I guess
I'll keep lookin'.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.822
[Doris] What exactly
are you looking for?

16:37.866 --> 16:40.042
The leader. The Master.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.566
You best come in, then.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.792
Where you're going,
you're going to need this.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.404
What about you?

16:54.448 --> 16:55.840
Danger's still out there.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.886
When you kill the Master,

16:58.495 --> 17:01.759
it's gonna take the world
a long time to recover.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.631
I won't live to see it.

17:03.674 --> 17:07.548
All I have to look forward to
is more of this shit.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.158
Don't you wanna see
the beginning?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.334
I know you'll do it.

17:12.553 --> 17:13.989
Take this.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.513
A man of the cloth
needs a crucifix.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.950
It'll see you through
to your darkest hour.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.478
Thank you.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.872
You want us to bury
those bodies?

17:27.916 --> 17:29.309
No, leave it.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.616
Let it be a warning
to any other assholes
who come around.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.054
[chuckles]

17:43.627 --> 17:44.759
[car door slams]

17:44.802 --> 17:46.239
[Doris] You take care now.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.197
Always trust in the crucifix.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.939
- It'll see you through
to the light.
- [engine starts]

17:53.289 --> 17:56.684
[engine revs]

17:59.643 --> 18:01.428
[vampire moans]

18:02.994 --> 18:05.084
Another dead town.

18:06.172 --> 18:09.000
Are we to walk and walk,

18:09.044 --> 18:12.613
with only dust
to cover our tongues?

18:13.918 --> 18:16.051
The Master is here.

18:16.791 --> 18:20.403
He shall provide
for us. [grunts]

18:20.447 --> 18:22.536
What if he doesn't?

18:22.579 --> 18:23.928
[sighs]

18:24.625 --> 18:26.757
You worry too much.

18:26.801 --> 18:29.934
What of this
can you change?

18:29.978 --> 18:31.153
Nothing.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.939
I'm just merely
voicing my concerns.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.768
[scoffs]
You are not alone.

18:38.465 --> 18:41.337
We are all sharing
your concerns.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.253
But unlike you,

18:44.297 --> 18:48.562
I think my mind
is better than yours
to find the solution.

18:48.605 --> 18:49.693
Enough!

18:50.825 --> 18:54.002
Do you want the Master to think
that you don't respect me?

18:54.698 --> 18:56.918
No, my Queen.
I apologize--

18:56.961 --> 18:58.311
Respect me!

19:00.356 --> 19:02.967
[snarling]

19:04.230 --> 19:05.231
[door squeaks]

19:05.970 --> 19:08.103
[Master sniffs and growls]

[speaks foreign language]

19:32.171 --> 19:34.216
[sniffs deeply]

19:36.479 --> 19:38.046
Good to see you.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.613
I'm glad you are here.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.224
Oh, it's good
to see you, my love.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.792
Indeed.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.924
How many have you raised?

19:48.622 --> 19:49.971
Just these three.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.494
I wish I could've
brought you more

19:51.538 --> 19:53.235
but so many are--

19:53.279 --> 19:55.672
There is no indignation,
my Queen.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.632
Well, it's not enough.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.591
The battle
is drawing close.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.944
Well, maybe we could go forage
and step on others.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.253
There is a hunter coming.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.561
We deal with him.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.519
Then we move.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.129
- [sniffs deeply]
- [moans]

20:18.173 --> 20:20.871
Oh, Master.
I haven't fed for days.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.046
[growls]

20:23.091 --> 20:24.266
In the cellar.

20:25.702 --> 20:29.271
But restrain yourself.
You must rest.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.316
Come.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.669
- [man] Master.
- [grunting]

20:35.712 --> 20:37.584
- The spy has left.
- [grunts]

20:39.412 --> 20:42.502
We only showed him
what I wanted him to see?

20:42.545 --> 20:44.678
Nothing of our true force?

20:44.721 --> 20:46.375
Of course not, my lord.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.682
Good! What of our casualties?

20:48.725 --> 20:50.074
For us, none.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.989
- Oh. [exhales]
- For them...

20:53.252 --> 20:55.384
all that we could find.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.734
[pants]

20:57.778 --> 21:00.346
- What of their leader?
- We got him.

21:00.389 --> 21:01.477
[Ultimate Master chuckles]

21:01.521 --> 21:03.958
He was hiding
in a shelter like a dog.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.873
[laughs]

21:06.656 --> 21:08.876
Bring him.
Bring him to me!

21:10.007 --> 21:11.618
Here he is, Master.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.097
He hasn't been touched.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.274
We killed them all
like children.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.188
They put up
no resistance.

21:17.232 --> 21:21.323
Most of them tried to run,
but no problem to us at all.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.587
I am one of many,
and many more will come.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.850
[screams, grunts]

21:26.894 --> 21:29.288
[groans]

21:29.331 --> 21:30.985
You better.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.813
You show
a little character.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.945
Maybe we can have
use of you after.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.556
I would rather die
than serve you.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.297
- [flesh crunches]
- [screams]

21:38.340 --> 21:40.647
[snarls]

[suspenseful music playing]

21:49.482 --> 21:51.962
[vampires growl]

21:52.572 --> 21:54.443
Ah. Finally.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.184
[Vampire Queen sighs]

21:58.012 --> 22:00.449
- Here! You want 'em?
- No!

22:00.493 --> 22:02.712
- Take 'em!
- No! Dad!

22:03.365 --> 22:06.499
Don't do this!
Why are you doing this?

22:06.542 --> 22:07.587
It's you or me.

22:08.283 --> 22:10.851
This is the way
you treat your daughters?

22:10.894 --> 22:13.332
Step daughters.
They don't mean nothing to me.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.770
Ah. Even the lowliest animal

22:16.813 --> 22:19.729
shows greater morals than you.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.210
I'm sure they won't be
missing you.

22:22.253 --> 22:25.605
- [growls]
- [women scream]

22:25.648 --> 22:27.781
[laughs]

22:27.824 --> 22:28.869
[moans]

22:31.828 --> 22:33.961
Feed. [snarls]

22:34.004 --> 22:36.877
[vampires growl]

22:36.920 --> 22:38.661
Thank you, my Queen.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.230
This shouldn't happen.
It's wrong.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.493
[Vampire Queen]
You see what the world is now.

22:44.537 --> 22:47.670
What? You'd rather
have taken his place?

22:48.323 --> 22:50.194
There's plenty
of mouths to feed.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.283
No. God, no.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.502
[sobbing]

22:54.547 --> 22:58.246
And you. You took that man
to be your husband?

22:58.289 --> 23:00.553
Look at the way
he treated your daughters.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.817
He had money,
he was a good provider!

23:03.860 --> 23:05.471
That's what this is about?

23:06.123 --> 23:08.430
- [mother screams, cries]
- [flesh crunches]

23:09.736 --> 23:11.607
You want a path
out of here?

23:11.651 --> 23:13.479
- [screams, laughs]
- Yes, I want out of here.

23:13.522 --> 23:16.307
I do! But not the way
you have in mind.

23:16.351 --> 23:19.528
I'd rather meet my maker
with this pure soul!

23:19.572 --> 23:22.009
[laughs]

23:22.792 --> 23:25.752
Well, what about me?
Ain't I good enough for you?

23:25.795 --> 23:26.840
[Queen chuckles]

23:26.883 --> 23:28.015
That's right.

23:28.755 --> 23:32.149
All you are
is blood to me.

23:32.193 --> 23:36.502
And you will live
until I say you die.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.329
[laughs]

23:38.373 --> 23:40.201
I-I...
I could join you.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.942
[laughs]

23:45.075 --> 23:46.860
There's a battle coming.

23:46.903 --> 23:50.167
One that has been brewing
for centuries,

23:50.211 --> 23:56.304
and all you'd be is a waste
of blood meant for others.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.093
Feast. Feed.

24:03.659 --> 24:06.575
- Thank you, my Queen.
- Enjoy.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.763
Who are you?

24:21.677 --> 24:23.157
Why are you here?

24:23.810 --> 24:25.115
My name's Jeff.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.249
I-I'm just a farmer,
they bit me.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.556
I was forced
to follow them here.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.253
You don't belong here.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.908
I know.
I don't wanna be here.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.736
I don't want any of this.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.566
I want life to be back
the way it used to be.

24:41.480 --> 24:46.441
It will never be
the way it used to be.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.358
You're free.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.754
But-- but where do I go?

24:55.581 --> 24:56.495
Go!

24:57.800 --> 24:58.845
Go!

24:58.888 --> 25:01.064
[snarling]

25:01.108 --> 25:02.892
[Philamena] We can't
just leave him here.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.764
He'll attract flies
and maggots.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.680
We need to draw
as little attention as possible,

25:07.723 --> 25:09.682
and using half our manpower
to drag him up there

25:09.725 --> 25:11.031
where they're at ain't it.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.860
Why? You think
they're gonna
forget about us?

25:13.903 --> 25:15.339
We're all
gonna die here.

25:19.779 --> 25:20.997
Why don't you ask him?

25:25.175 --> 25:27.047
- Please.
- [growls]

25:27.090 --> 25:29.528
You don't want me.
I have hepatitis.

25:30.616 --> 25:31.921
Oh, really?

25:33.270 --> 25:35.011
So you think I should
just let you go?

25:35.055 --> 25:36.317
You have the rest of us.

25:37.840 --> 25:41.061
How many more
are suddenly gonna pop up
with blood diseases?

25:42.018 --> 25:44.281
Or be near death,
if I show you mercy.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.545
- It's true!
- [snarls]

25:47.894 --> 25:49.330
[villagers sobbing]

25:53.856 --> 25:55.466
[growls]

25:56.250 --> 25:57.556
This will do.

25:59.209 --> 26:02.778
Watch me,
or you'll be next.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.867
[growls]

26:05.564 --> 26:07.130
[hisses]

26:11.134 --> 26:12.266
[woman gasps]

26:22.015 --> 26:23.843
You turned fast.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.106
Faster than the others.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.238
Do you feel it?

26:28.282 --> 26:30.284
I can't fight it.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.894
[sobs]

26:31.938 --> 26:35.071
I need... I need to.

26:35.768 --> 26:38.161
[Vampire Queen]
And you're gonna start
right here.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.859
Feed on the ones
you love.

26:39.902 --> 26:42.252
- [women sob]
- [mumbles] ...feeding.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.819
- [sobs]
- [Sarah] No...

26:43.863 --> 26:45.473
Mom, no.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.606
[Helen] Please.
You can't do it.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.042
Fight it!

26:49.085 --> 26:51.435
I won't do it.

26:51.479 --> 26:52.959
I could never!

26:53.829 --> 26:54.961
[chuckles]

26:55.004 --> 26:56.615
You're gonna feed
on your daughter.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.791
Maybe the others!

26:58.834 --> 27:02.011
No. I want you to feed
on your daughter.

27:02.055 --> 27:05.406
You'll need the energy
and you will feel alive.

27:05.449 --> 27:08.322
I refuse!
I'm not like you!

27:08.365 --> 27:10.150
Oh, yes,
you're just like me.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.327
You'll see. You'll see.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.637
[follower] What is it, my lord?

27:20.290 --> 27:25.992
I have taught
my apprentice well.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.515
I don't understand.

27:28.211 --> 27:31.737
For a long time,
I have felt a--

27:31.780 --> 27:34.783
a contradiction within you.

27:34.827 --> 27:39.266
As if you were
holding a secret.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.268
I still don't understand.

27:41.311 --> 27:45.359
My spy. Did he hide
himself well?

27:46.490 --> 27:48.362
Not at all, my lord.

27:49.276 --> 27:50.494
We knew he was there.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.801
Almost from the start.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.107
Exactly.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.500
He sent a spy,

27:56.544 --> 27:58.894
thinking I would
not notice the one

27:58.938 --> 28:02.202
right beside me.

28:02.245 --> 28:06.162
- [grunts]
- [Ultimate Master laughs]

28:08.556 --> 28:09.992
Why?

28:10.036 --> 28:13.213
You had everything!

28:14.083 --> 28:17.304
But you betray me! Why?

28:17.347 --> 28:19.088
I want to be
on the winning side.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.351
[Ultimate Master laughs]

28:21.395 --> 28:25.181
- You idiotic fool!
- [flesh squelches]

28:25.225 --> 28:27.183
[grunts and groans]

28:27.227 --> 28:31.361
[grunting]

28:33.886 --> 28:37.759
- [engine revs]
- [John] Yo.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.892
- [Charlie groans]
- We've got somebody up ahead.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.589
[Charlie sighs]
He's probably been bitten.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.244
We should just
run him over.
Just in case.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.462
What is wrong
with you?

28:46.202 --> 28:48.465
I wanna stay alive,
that's what's wrong.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.032
Staying alive is one thing.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.599
Keeping your humanity
is another.

28:52.252 --> 28:53.732
Well, maybe
I don't have any.

28:54.820 --> 28:55.951
Everybody's got it.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.780
It's a choice whether
you keep it or not.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.744
Get out! Real slow.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.834
Just step outside
and keep cool.

29:09.443 --> 29:10.487
[Charlie sighs]

29:13.055 --> 29:14.100
[grunts]

29:17.190 --> 29:18.191
You all right?

29:18.931 --> 29:21.803
I'm good. I could use
a ride, though.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.023
Where you headed?

29:24.980 --> 29:26.025
I don't know.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.723
Would appreciate it
if you lowered the weapon.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.074
Okay.

29:33.728 --> 29:37.340
You can ride with us
but I gotta check you
for bite marks.

29:39.081 --> 29:42.781
I can understand that,
man, but I guarantee ya,

29:43.651 --> 29:44.783
I ain't been bitten.

29:46.697 --> 29:47.916
Hop in the back.

29:51.441 --> 29:54.662
[brooding western music playing]

29:56.969 --> 29:59.841
I'm John. This is Charlie.

30:01.451 --> 30:02.496
I'm Rico.

30:03.627 --> 30:05.281
- Hey, Rico.
- Yeah?

30:05.325 --> 30:07.457
Not the first time in the back
of a police car, huh?

30:07.501 --> 30:08.545
[laughs]

30:10.243 --> 30:11.679
[John laughs]

30:11.722 --> 30:13.376
You gotta love
the nerve, huh?

30:24.300 --> 30:26.520
- Got one!
- Yes! Now we can try

30:26.563 --> 30:28.565
- the garlic shotgun shells.
- Yes.

30:31.307 --> 30:32.961
[engine roars]

30:35.007 --> 30:36.312
[Brooke]
Don't get too confident.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.053
Some of them can move fast.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.750
[Elena] Nah,
not this one. Look at him.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.622
He hasn't fed
in a long time.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.929
He's all... [moans, chuckles]

30:44.581 --> 30:46.453
[laughs]

30:46.496 --> 30:47.541
Let's get him.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.593
- You gotta aim for the heart.
- I am.

31:03.426 --> 31:04.558
[blood splatters]

31:05.080 --> 31:06.081
[chuckles]

31:06.995 --> 31:08.649
Hey, careful.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.390
Okay. I got this.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.609
So bossy.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.748
[Brooke] Well,
look at that. You got him.

31:20.791 --> 31:24.230
That was a little too easy.
I like a challenge.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.667
All right.
Get him in the trunk.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.629
Uh, he's heavy.
Can I get a little help here?

31:33.195 --> 31:34.980
You kill him,
you bag him.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.765
Seriously?

31:41.508 --> 31:43.379
[engine roars]

31:47.557 --> 31:48.776
This could be trouble.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.386
What are we gonna do?

31:50.430 --> 31:52.301
Let's see what they do.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.216
Get rid of the badge
and the hat.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.740
Some people get nervous
around cops.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.917
Well, let me out.
I don't look like no cop.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.440
You can say that again.

32:00.483 --> 32:01.789
[Charlie chuckles]

32:01.832 --> 32:04.096
- [radio static]
- We are not cops.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.272
I repeat,

32:06.315 --> 32:08.883
- we are not police officers.
- [radio static]

32:08.927 --> 32:10.232
Stay cool.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.886
[car chimes]

32:14.671 --> 32:17.544
[suspenseful music playing]

32:19.676 --> 32:22.418
Good job. You told us
you ain't cops.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.855
I figured that
was a good idea.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.293
So if you ain't cops then
what are you doing here?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.686
- We're vampire hunters.
- [Brooke chuckles]

32:30.557 --> 32:31.950
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.734
So how many have you killed?

32:33.777 --> 32:34.909
Well, I'm in training.

32:34.953 --> 32:35.997
[both chuckle]

32:37.520 --> 32:39.653
Listen, we do that ourselves,
so we don't need you guys.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.698
Well, maybe you can help us.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.049
We're lookin'
for the Master.

32:44.092 --> 32:47.008
[ominous tones]

32:49.576 --> 32:52.057
Follow us.
We'll take you to Daddy.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.723
[brooding guitar music playing]

33:26.569 --> 33:28.093
- Who are these?
- [Brooke] They say

33:28.136 --> 33:30.225
- they're vampire hunters.
- [chuckles]

33:30.269 --> 33:31.574
You kill any?

33:31.618 --> 33:32.662
Some.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.056
We're lookin'
for the Master.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.276
He's come this way.

33:37.319 --> 33:40.018
And you think you got
what it takes to kill him?

33:40.757 --> 33:42.542
I aim to find out.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.022
We killed one today.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.416
Show me.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.071
[trunk door opens]

33:52.204 --> 33:53.640
That's Jeff Lockwood.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.469
He had a place over east.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.297
He was a good man.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.125
Came from that way.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.736
We buried a woman there.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.433
That's why we're out here.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.175
The old place
wasn't defensible.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.831
At least out here
we can see 'em coming
and keep on runnin'.

34:13.312 --> 34:16.402
Well, at least we've got
a way to fight back now.

34:17.794 --> 34:21.320
You're mistaken.
This man wasn't fully turned.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.714
Best way you can fight back

34:26.020 --> 34:27.065
is help us.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.111
Come on inside.
Let's go talk.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.859
Chop that up and cook it.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.252
Doesn't work on them.

34:40.295 --> 34:42.036
Now how the hell
are you so sure about it?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.124
Tried it.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.430
[Brooke] You got bit?

34:44.473 --> 34:45.779
But not turned.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.564
What does that make you?
The chosen one or something?

34:49.261 --> 34:50.175
Maybe.

34:51.306 --> 34:52.525
You comin' or what?

34:54.396 --> 34:55.397
Damn.

34:59.488 --> 35:02.317
It's alcohol.
It's for the vehicles.

35:02.361 --> 35:03.710
They've been converted.

35:03.753 --> 35:05.364
Where'd you get it?

35:05.407 --> 35:07.279
I got a still hidden-aways off.

35:08.802 --> 35:11.544
[John sighs]

35:12.371 --> 35:14.286
You must do
a lot of drivin'.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.765
Most of it's not for us.

35:16.592 --> 35:19.073
There's a local militia
operating out of the mountains.

35:19.682 --> 35:22.946
They come down here
and they claim it as their tax.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.862
Bunch of bullies
and thugs, mostly.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.690
Now they say they're Army,

35:27.734 --> 35:30.084
but I can tell by lookin'
at 'em, they ain't.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.130
- You served?
- Yeah.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.133
And the man that
your daughter killed.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.223
He came from the mountains.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.747
Do you think
those bloodsuckers
are up there?

35:40.790 --> 35:42.009
Ah, maybe.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.534
But that guy could've been
walkin' around in circles.

35:45.578 --> 35:47.275
Who knows where
he started from.

35:48.276 --> 35:51.192
Now, you're gonna ask
the militia tomorrow.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.933
They should be
turnin' up then.

35:53.542 --> 35:54.761
You think they're
willing to help?

35:55.370 --> 35:57.372
Yeah. If there's
something in it for them.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.069
You'll have to ask.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.464
Now, you're welcome
to stay here, if you want,

36:02.508 --> 36:03.944
but you'll have
to sleep outside.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.252
I've got a bedroll.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.211
[Charlie] I don't.
Where am I sleeping?

36:15.347 --> 36:17.523
I think he needs to be buried
next to his wife.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.874
I'll take him
over there tomorrow
when our friends leave.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.224
They're staying?

36:23.268 --> 36:26.836
Yeah, just one night,
outside. It's okay.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.405
Hey, guys. I left my bike
back there aways.

36:30.449 --> 36:33.016
Is there any way
I can get a ride
and some gas?

36:33.930 --> 36:35.193
I'll give you a ride.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.592
- [Rico] We got trouble.
- Aw, shit. Vampires.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.594
Sure looks like it.
What you gonna do?

36:45.638 --> 36:48.858
Uh, I got garlic
shotgun shells. You down?

36:49.424 --> 36:50.730
Hell, yeah, I'm down.

36:51.905 --> 36:54.777
Don't get too close, though.
Those things move fast.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.388
Don't worry, we got this.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.221
How's this?

37:04.744 --> 37:05.962
Wait till they get
a little closer.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.355
Those shells
will spread out,

37:07.399 --> 37:09.879
especially with
my sawed-off. Now!

37:14.101 --> 37:16.451
[guns cock and fire]

37:21.935 --> 37:24.154
Screw this!
Let's get outta here.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.860
I reckon my bike
should be right up there.

37:34.774 --> 37:35.862
[Elena] Yeah, I see it.

37:53.749 --> 37:54.794
Nice bike.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.753
Thanks. It's my pride and joy.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.452
Only thing I've ever
really had, you know?

38:01.757 --> 38:04.456
You know, that alcohol
isn't too good for the engine.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.936
It's probably
gonna outlast me.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.982
[engine stalls and churns]

38:13.378 --> 38:15.031
[engine purrs]

38:18.383 --> 38:19.862
Man, that sounds good.

38:20.559 --> 38:23.823
Now the only problem we got
is them vampires down the road.

38:23.866 --> 38:25.433
You want me
to run interference?

38:25.477 --> 38:26.869
No, don't worry about it.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.349
We'll just take
the long way home.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.569
Okay. Well, I'll catch you
at your daddy's place.

38:30.612 --> 38:31.613
[Elena] Okay.

38:35.225 --> 38:38.403
[engine roars]

38:38.446 --> 38:40.318
[tense music playing]

38:41.667 --> 38:43.233
[vampires snarl]

38:43.277 --> 38:46.628
Adios,mother suckers!

38:48.761 --> 38:50.371
[engine roars]

38:56.290 --> 38:57.378
[vampires snarl]

38:59.511 --> 39:01.339
[engine roars]

39:08.911 --> 39:10.478
[engine clacks, stops]

39:13.916 --> 39:15.048
How is she runnin'?

39:15.091 --> 39:17.703
No complaints,
but we got us a problem.

39:17.746 --> 39:19.748
Ran into some vampires
back there.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.489
- Elena?
- Oh, she's good.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.404
She did a little detour
around 'em.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.363
But you know
those garlic shells?

39:26.015 --> 39:27.190
They don't work.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.323
Looks like our friend
was right.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.456
And I'm afraid
they're coming this way.

39:32.413 --> 39:33.849
I'll stand guard tonight.

39:35.895 --> 39:39.377
[sullen music playing]

39:39.420 --> 39:40.682
[crickets chirp]

40:48.489 --> 40:49.708
[Daddy Thompson]
Get off of him!

- [screams]
- [flesh squelches]

40:54.321 --> 40:56.018
[sobs] No! Daddy!

40:56.671 --> 40:59.369
Daddy! [screams]

40:59.413 --> 41:00.849
No!

41:06.464 --> 41:09.728
You! I will tear you
apart for that!

41:09.771 --> 41:12.339
Fuck you, motherfucker!

41:14.080 --> 41:15.473
[both panting]

41:15.516 --> 41:16.909
- Get back!
- Oh, fuck.

41:16.952 --> 41:17.997
Get back!

41:18.606 --> 41:19.912
- [grunts]
- Get back! Get back!

41:21.827 --> 41:22.871
- [crossbow fires]
- [grunts]

41:23.829 --> 41:28.181
You are the hunter
the Master spoke of.

41:28.790 --> 41:32.577
I will make you
suffer for that!

41:40.541 --> 41:43.370
- And you will suffer no more.
- [crossbow fires]

41:58.124 --> 42:00.692
- [electricity zaps]
- [Master] Something's happened.

42:02.215 --> 42:04.696
- [Master sighs]
- [groans]

42:04.739 --> 42:06.567
- [electricity zaps]
- [Master] He is dead.

42:08.047 --> 42:09.309
The hunter.

42:12.312 --> 42:13.661
He is coming.

42:15.445 --> 42:16.838
[sighs] He's dead.

42:17.404 --> 42:18.927
He ain't coming back
this time.

42:18.971 --> 42:21.103
Looks like these crucifixes
are worth keepin'.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.758
Problem is they split
when they hit the target.

42:23.802 --> 42:25.107
Can't use 'em again.

42:25.151 --> 42:26.805
Well, hell, we could
make some more.

42:26.848 --> 42:30.112
Gotta be made
from certain wood,
blessed the right way.

42:30.809 --> 42:32.114
Blessed by the right people.

42:33.899 --> 42:35.596
Daddy, no!

42:35.640 --> 42:37.903
No. Don't come close.

42:38.904 --> 42:40.296
My blood is infected.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.256
No! No.

42:43.996 --> 42:47.216
It's all right.
I'm gonna join your mother.

42:47.260 --> 42:49.349
No, Daddy. No,
you can't leave us.

42:49.392 --> 42:51.481
Look, he got bit and
he's okay.

42:51.525 --> 42:52.657
Maybe you'll be fine.

42:53.266 --> 42:55.181
[breathes shallowly]

42:56.835 --> 42:58.488
That's unlikely.

42:58.532 --> 43:02.101
It seems your crossbow works.

43:02.144 --> 43:03.189
Yeah.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.191
That's good to know.

43:06.409 --> 43:08.542
'Cause I think you got
another one to do.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.675
- [Elena] No.
- [breathes shallowly]

43:10.718 --> 43:11.719
I guess so.

43:12.720 --> 43:16.115
[strained] I've raised
two strong girls,

43:16.158 --> 43:18.030
who can take care
of themselves now.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.510
You can do it.

43:22.121 --> 43:23.775
[groaning]

43:28.083 --> 43:29.607
You hear me?

43:32.218 --> 43:33.611
[sniffles] Yes, Daddy.

43:34.307 --> 43:35.438
[Daddy] Let's do this.

43:36.439 --> 43:37.615
[groans]

43:41.793 --> 43:43.185
[sobbing]

43:44.186 --> 43:45.840
[Daddy groaning]

43:47.146 --> 43:48.190
Speak.

43:48.887 --> 43:51.498
Many of your followers
have yet to arrive.

43:51.541 --> 43:54.022
Do you wish us to start
search for them?

43:54.066 --> 43:59.158
I have no use for the weak,
unable to get here
by themselves.

43:59.201 --> 44:02.378
We are so few.
How can we possibly prevail?

44:04.511 --> 44:07.470
The whole world
has been ravaged.

44:08.428 --> 44:10.822
They will be facing
the same problems as us.

44:13.389 --> 44:14.434
Now, go.

44:15.087 --> 44:16.479
Trust in me.

44:16.523 --> 44:17.742
Yes, my lord.

44:19.569 --> 44:20.658
We've been talkin'.

44:20.701 --> 44:22.747
When you're leavin',
we're comin' with.

44:22.790 --> 44:24.444
I appreciate that.

44:26.141 --> 44:28.927
Those shells of yours
don't kill 'em,

44:28.970 --> 44:30.798
but seem to slow 'em down.

44:30.842 --> 44:32.757
We'll get making some more.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.149
Can I get some of those?

44:34.193 --> 44:35.455
Figure with my two barrels,

44:35.498 --> 44:36.761
I could blast 'em in the face,

44:36.804 --> 44:38.414
and blind 'em temporarily.

44:38.458 --> 44:39.502
Worth tryin'.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.070
Think I'll get my chance?

44:42.114 --> 44:43.724
I can guarantee that.

44:46.074 --> 44:48.511
I just can't guarantee
we're gonna live.

44:48.555 --> 44:52.559
Yeah, well, I'd rather take
my chances out there
than sit here and rot.

44:52.602 --> 44:54.735
Hell, John, I should've
been dead already.

44:55.344 --> 44:56.824
The way I look at it,

44:56.868 --> 44:58.652
any chance to kill
one of those things,

44:59.348 --> 45:00.393
I'm good.

45:00.436 --> 45:01.481
All right.

45:02.569 --> 45:04.136
Let's get some rest.

45:04.179 --> 45:06.399
Let's see what the militia's
got to say tomorrow.

45:37.256 --> 45:39.562
Hey. Be careful with them.

45:44.654 --> 45:46.874
- [car door slams]
- [bird squawks]

45:50.182 --> 45:51.270
You did this?

45:54.186 --> 45:56.231
- Yeah.
- Vampire?

45:56.275 --> 45:58.538
- Yep.
- I ain't buyin' that.

45:58.581 --> 46:00.845
Exactly. Bullshit.

46:01.497 --> 46:02.803
Check the teeth.

46:10.419 --> 46:11.769
It's for real.

46:11.812 --> 46:14.075
That don't mean nothin'.
Could've found him dead.

46:14.119 --> 46:16.425
Are you trying
to impress us?

46:16.469 --> 46:17.775
Maybe I am.

46:17.818 --> 46:19.559
- [Ryan] Well, it ain't workin'.
- [John] Pity.

46:20.168 --> 46:22.170
Could've used your help
to kill more of 'em.

46:22.214 --> 46:23.171
[LaCroix chuckles]

46:23.215 --> 46:24.303
Our help?

46:24.869 --> 46:26.087
What do you need
our help for?

46:26.131 --> 46:27.567
[bird squawks]

46:27.610 --> 46:29.177
I'm lookin' for the Master.

46:29.221 --> 46:31.876
[chuckles]
Good luck with that.

46:33.051 --> 46:35.531
I ain't going anywhere
near any Master.

46:35.575 --> 46:37.011
I just wanna find him.

46:37.925 --> 46:40.798
Big country.
Lot of ground to cover.

46:40.841 --> 46:43.235
I suppose you want us
to do all your lookin'?

46:43.278 --> 46:45.193
Like I said,
I could use the help.

46:46.238 --> 46:47.717
Why don't you tell your boss?

46:47.761 --> 46:49.371
He's not our boss!

46:49.415 --> 46:51.025
He's our captain!

46:51.634 --> 46:53.332
Well, then tell your captain.

46:53.375 --> 46:54.942
Might be worth his while.

46:54.986 --> 46:56.509
[laughs]

46:56.552 --> 46:59.077
Hey, honey! How about
you get those crates for us?

47:01.514 --> 47:03.211
So you're just passing
through, huh?

47:03.255 --> 47:04.691
Yep.

47:04.734 --> 47:07.259
You stick around,
you gotta start paying taxes.

47:07.999 --> 47:09.000
"Taxes."

47:13.221 --> 47:14.222
[chuckles]

47:15.049 --> 47:16.268
Nice.

47:18.923 --> 47:20.838
- Your bike?
- Yes, sir.

47:22.361 --> 47:25.016
Really, I can-- I can get you
a good deal on that.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.540
I'm good, man.
Thank you.

47:28.541 --> 47:30.760
Oh, you sure?

47:30.804 --> 47:32.893
Get you water, food.

47:33.676 --> 47:34.721
Vehicle.

47:35.374 --> 47:37.332
Plenty of fuel
to roll with.

47:37.376 --> 47:39.595
I am not interested.

47:40.292 --> 47:41.336
Thank you.

47:44.165 --> 47:46.080
Why don't you think
about that, hm?

47:46.124 --> 47:47.125
Okay.

47:48.474 --> 47:50.084
But it's still
not for sale.

47:51.259 --> 47:52.304
You know,

47:53.522 --> 47:55.046
I'm startin'
not to like you.

48:00.486 --> 48:03.706
Why don't you just
not be here
when I get back?

48:13.238 --> 48:15.501
[bottles clinking]

48:15.544 --> 48:17.416
Don't. It won't help.

48:18.939 --> 48:21.986
[bottles clinking]

48:34.128 --> 48:35.129
[blows a kiss]

48:38.567 --> 48:40.221
Where's your daddy?

48:40.787 --> 48:42.049
Busy.

48:42.093 --> 48:43.442
Had somethin' to do.

48:43.485 --> 48:46.227
Is that right?

48:46.271 --> 48:49.274
Is this your new boyfriend?

48:49.317 --> 48:50.449
You look a little
disappointed.

48:51.580 --> 48:53.800
You best make sure
he gets that message.

48:53.843 --> 48:55.497
[laughs]

48:55.541 --> 48:56.672
I will!

48:56.716 --> 48:58.196
Just don't hold your breath!

49:05.290 --> 49:06.682
You sure you know
what you're doin'?

49:07.292 --> 49:09.120
I'm wingin' it as usual.

49:09.163 --> 49:11.078
[Brooke] How long
you gonna wait for 'em?

49:11.122 --> 49:12.688
I can wait two days.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.648
He's close.

49:17.302 --> 49:18.825
I'm feeling
he's getting stronger.

49:20.827 --> 49:23.047
[tense music playing]

49:27.094 --> 49:28.095
[bottles clink]

49:33.274 --> 49:34.275
He's comin'.

49:36.147 --> 49:37.148
"He's comin'?"

49:37.800 --> 49:39.411
That sounds like an army.

49:43.763 --> 49:46.679
[engine roars]

50:26.458 --> 50:27.415
[chuckles]

50:42.822 --> 50:44.476
Okay, vampire hunter.

50:44.519 --> 50:46.695
You got me interested.
Let's go talk.

50:47.566 --> 50:50.917
So, how have you been doin'
out here, alone?

50:50.960 --> 50:54.094
Still think you don't need
any, uh, companionship?

50:54.703 --> 50:56.401
You better watch your mouth.

50:57.532 --> 51:00.622
I'll cut your balls off
and feed 'em to your little pet.

51:00.666 --> 51:03.190
Yeah, I, uh,
I don't need that,

51:03.234 --> 51:06.585
but I'm sure Shelton here
can handle you.

51:07.760 --> 51:10.893
I like it rough.
Think your sister here
would go for it?

51:10.937 --> 51:13.070
- Hey, that's enough, boys.
- [metal clanks]

51:14.288 --> 51:15.420
Y'all need to move on.

51:17.030 --> 51:18.510
You gonna take us
all on yourself?

51:18.553 --> 51:19.815
If I have to.

51:19.859 --> 51:21.817
I should just
shoot you right now.

51:21.861 --> 51:25.734
Yeah, you could,
but I don't think you have
the authority, fuck face.

51:26.344 --> 51:28.868
Think you need to go ask
your little boss up there.

51:28.911 --> 51:29.869
Sheep.

51:33.220 --> 51:35.614
I need you two to get those men
away from the women.

51:36.658 --> 51:37.833
Seems fine to me.

51:37.877 --> 51:39.400
Do it.

51:39.444 --> 51:41.620
Doesn't seem a problem.
Maybe we should ask Torque.

51:41.663 --> 51:44.405
You don't need to talk to him.
I gave you an order.

51:44.449 --> 51:45.580
We'll wait.

51:46.929 --> 51:49.367
I don't see Torque interfering
with a little fun.

51:50.107 --> 51:53.110
Okay, boys!
You need to calm down.

51:54.285 --> 51:55.503
I am calm.

51:55.547 --> 51:57.026
Oh, that's real good.

51:57.984 --> 52:01.770
'Cause last time I checked,
we all had a common enemy.

52:01.814 --> 52:04.773
The vampires.
You remember them, huh?

52:05.383 --> 52:07.167
While you're all busy arguing,

52:07.211 --> 52:10.127
they're gonna sneak up
behind you and bleed your ass.

52:10.823 --> 52:13.782
Jesus! I wasn't talking
right now, you goddamn idiot!

52:13.826 --> 52:15.349
I was talking metaphorically.

52:15.393 --> 52:17.221
Let's go before
they get rapey again.

52:17.917 --> 52:19.353
Impressive.

52:21.138 --> 52:22.269
I'm glad you like it.

52:22.878 --> 52:24.619
What do you need us for?

52:24.663 --> 52:26.708
[John] There's a lot
of terrain out there.

52:26.752 --> 52:28.449
I assume you know it well.

52:29.450 --> 52:32.279
I'd appreciate it if your men
could help me track him down.

52:32.975 --> 52:36.544
Why would I help you?

52:37.676 --> 52:39.765
When I kill the Master,

52:39.808 --> 52:42.159
this country's gonna need
somebody to take care of it.

52:43.899 --> 52:46.424
It seems to me
that you're the man to do that.

52:47.990 --> 52:49.253
This world needs order.

52:50.950 --> 52:53.300
Tell you what.
You hang around here.

52:53.909 --> 52:56.869
I'll be back
within two days.

52:56.912 --> 52:59.176
I believe that would be good.

52:59.219 --> 53:01.917
If he's within 100 miles
of this place,

53:01.961 --> 53:03.441
we'll find him for you.

53:07.575 --> 53:08.794
What happened?

53:08.837 --> 53:11.188
They're behaving
like pigs, like usual.

53:12.493 --> 53:13.668
I didn't see nothin'.

53:13.712 --> 53:14.974
All I saw was a bunch of guys

53:15.017 --> 53:16.367
makin' polite conversation.

53:16.410 --> 53:17.411
Yeah.

53:18.195 --> 53:19.631
You stay away from them.

53:19.674 --> 53:21.546
If you ask me,
she's too sensitive.

53:21.589 --> 53:22.851
She's been on her own
too long.

53:22.895 --> 53:24.940
Well, I ain't asking you,

53:24.984 --> 53:26.986
and it seems like
you've been alone too long.

53:27.029 --> 53:29.423
Maybe you should let things
work out the way they should.

53:29.467 --> 53:31.817
I'd be very careful,
if I was you.

53:36.735 --> 53:38.389
I apologize
for my friends here.

53:39.085 --> 53:41.609
They're the sheep
that has lost their shepherd.

53:41.653 --> 53:44.482
Mm. Maybe you need
new friends.

53:44.525 --> 53:45.961
Yo! Let's go!

53:46.962 --> 53:48.225
Take care.

53:48.268 --> 53:49.791
You too, vampire hunter.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.234
Do you trust him?

53:59.540 --> 54:00.498
Nope,

54:01.107 --> 54:03.718
but I gave him the best deal
he's ever gonna get.

54:03.762 --> 54:05.590
That man's gonna be
trouble, John.

54:06.504 --> 54:08.157
That's what I thought
about you.

54:09.507 --> 54:11.117
But I'm afraid
you may be right.

54:17.863 --> 54:20.779
I have arrived.
I am Nosferatu.

54:22.041 --> 54:24.913
[sighs] Yes,
we can see that.

54:24.957 --> 54:26.480
I need to speak
to the Queen.

54:27.351 --> 54:29.309
We will let her know
you have arrived.

54:29.353 --> 54:32.181
I must speak to the Queen.
It is important.

54:34.183 --> 54:35.141
Wait.

54:35.837 --> 54:37.883
If she wishes to speak to you,
she will come.

54:40.712 --> 54:41.756
You.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.931
Speak.

54:43.715 --> 54:45.064
Where are the rest?

54:45.107 --> 54:47.066
My Queen,
they're scattered.

54:47.719 --> 54:49.155
I know not where.

54:50.896 --> 54:52.201
[snarls]

54:53.899 --> 54:55.553
[growls]

54:56.684 --> 54:59.252
Who is this that demands
an audience with my Queen?

54:59.861 --> 55:01.428
I've seen
the dead bodies.

55:02.473 --> 55:05.432
I can attest
to his existence.

55:06.346 --> 55:08.783
We are both aware
of the hunter.

55:10.742 --> 55:12.134
Now go rest.

55:28.150 --> 55:29.413
[Williams] Looks kinda quiet.

55:29.456 --> 55:31.066
[Johnston]
What were you expecting?

55:31.110 --> 55:33.373
I don't know. Doesn't look like
there's anybody here.

55:33.417 --> 55:34.679
You think there'd be somethin'.

55:34.722 --> 55:36.028
Take a drive down
that main street.

55:36.071 --> 55:37.856
You spot anyone,
vampire or not,

55:37.899 --> 55:39.336
hit the goddamn gas.

55:39.379 --> 55:40.424
Ah, crap.

55:40.989 --> 55:42.948
I can guarantee
I'll be doing that.

55:42.991 --> 55:44.515
We should've
brought bayonets.

55:44.558 --> 55:46.212
Might give us
a fighting chance.

55:46.255 --> 55:48.040
Should we aim our guns
out the window?

55:48.083 --> 55:49.433
It's not gonna work.

55:49.476 --> 55:51.217
It might be something.

55:51.260 --> 55:53.262
I need every chance
we can get!

55:54.438 --> 55:56.178
How many vampires
have you approached?

55:56.222 --> 55:58.616
None, and I'm hoping
to keep it that way.

55:58.659 --> 56:01.488
Uh-huh, so you got
no better idea
than we do on this.

56:01.532 --> 56:03.055
I know what to do.

56:03.751 --> 56:05.405
[Lambert] I wish I had my knife.

56:05.449 --> 56:07.668
We should've spent last night
carving stakes.

56:07.712 --> 56:09.366
They said they tried it.
Now quiet.

56:11.019 --> 56:12.325
Head down the main street.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.458
Keep the engine revs
as low as possible.

56:14.501 --> 56:16.111
We don't wanna draw
any attention to ourselves.

56:16.155 --> 56:17.199
All right.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.862
[suspenseful music playing]

56:40.092 --> 56:42.181
So, we checked it out.
Should we go now?

56:42.224 --> 56:45.097
We can't. Torque will ask us
if we checked inside
these buildings.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.142
So, we lie.
Screw all that.

56:47.882 --> 56:49.231
We can't lie.

56:49.275 --> 56:51.625
Torque will ask us
if we checked these buildings.

56:51.669 --> 56:54.236
What if they are in there?
They'll kill us.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.716
We'll leave
the car doors open.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.283
We'll kick in the doors
of these buildings.

56:57.326 --> 56:59.416
We see anybody,
jump back in the car
and we're gone.

57:00.721 --> 57:02.114
[door thuds]

57:03.681 --> 57:05.291

57:21.176 --> 57:22.700

- [grunts]

57:24.223 --> 57:26.225
- [vampire snarls]
- [flesh squelches]

57:26.268 --> 57:27.748
[groans, screams]

57:29.271 --> 57:30.708
Hey, where's Lambert?

57:30.751 --> 57:31.926
I don't know,
I wasn't watching!

57:32.536 --> 57:33.667
- [vampire snarls]
- [screams]

57:33.711 --> 57:34.973
He's dead!

57:35.016 --> 57:36.409
[Johnston] Shit,
get us outta here!

57:36.453 --> 57:37.932
[grunts]

57:37.976 --> 57:41.675
Hey! Hey!
Where you goin'?

57:41.719 --> 57:43.285
There's no escaping.

57:43.329 --> 57:44.678
- [screams]
- [snarls]

57:46.419 --> 57:48.595
[door thuds, creaks]

58:03.001 --> 58:04.481
[laughs]

58:05.264 --> 58:07.005
That doesn't work for me.

58:09.181 --> 58:12.314
- [Johnston pants]
- [gun clicks]

58:12.358 --> 58:13.881
[gun clatters]

58:17.711 --> 58:18.930
[snarls]

58:20.105 --> 58:21.323
What are you doing here?

58:21.367 --> 58:22.977
Please, I don't wanna die.

58:23.021 --> 58:25.066
You're not going to die.

58:25.110 --> 58:26.503
Now, tell me.

58:27.155 --> 58:29.157
What are you doing here?

58:29.201 --> 58:32.421
Vampire hunter,
he sent us.
He's nearby.

58:35.337 --> 58:36.513
So he's coming.

58:37.949 --> 58:39.472
You want me to send him
a message?

58:40.081 --> 58:41.430
Yes.

58:41.474 --> 58:44.129
I would love
to send him a message.

58:45.957 --> 58:47.654
[chuckles]

58:49.700 --> 58:52.398
I said you will live.
You will live...

58:53.573 --> 58:55.619
- Forever.
- [laughs]

58:55.662 --> 58:57.577
[growls]

58:57.621 --> 59:00.188
- [Johnston screams]
- [Master growls]

59:08.022 --> 59:10.111
It's Johnston.
Looks like he's been bitten.

59:11.156 --> 59:12.200
Keep goin'.

59:16.596 --> 59:18.206
He was a good man!

59:18.250 --> 59:20.948
He deserves better than just
being left out here to turn.

59:21.645 --> 59:23.647
We'll let the vampire hunter
come and deal with him later.

59:23.690 --> 59:24.822
He's not going anywhere.

59:26.867 --> 59:28.216
You see, there you go.

59:28.913 --> 59:30.479
You know, you'll never be
a great leader

59:30.523 --> 59:32.699
if you worry about
the loss of every soldier.

59:32.743 --> 59:34.353
This is fuckin' war, you know.

59:36.094 --> 59:37.748
[driver] We're almost
there now, sir.

59:38.400 --> 59:40.402
- Pull over.
- [driver] All right.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:03.774
Let 'em know we're here.

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:07.691
[horn honks]

01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:09.040
I'm gonna go check things out.

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.737
You guys stay here.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.439
I sure hope he knows
what he's doing.

01:00:20.747 --> 01:00:22.575
[Destias] What on earth?

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:26.710
Are there still such
stupid people left alive?

01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:28.015
I need to see it.

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:36.937
It could be a trap.

01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:39.070
You still want to go?

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:41.507
Of course not, my lord.

01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:45.729
I was just trying to serve you
as best as I could.

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.259
I...

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:58.611
I have never met anyone
wanting to die,

01:00:59.264 --> 01:01:01.570
as badly as you.

01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:03.790
I'm here to see your master.

01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:07.359
You assume I am not the Master.

01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:09.056
I doubt that.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.972
We all know the boss is never
the first to show his face.

01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:14.671
I got a feeling you guys
are not too high up
on the totem pole.

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:16.107
Careful.

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.805
I could kill you so quickly.

01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:21.590
Wait here.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:27.074
Coming here like this
is unexpected.

01:01:28.032 --> 01:01:32.210
You are either very brave,
or very foolish.

01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:34.255
I figure it's a risk
I'm willing to take.

01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:38.390
What has happened
out there?

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:41.306
A human would like
to speak to you.

01:01:42.089 --> 01:01:43.612
Send him in.

01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:45.745
Yes, my lord.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:48.835
[laughs]

01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:52.709
[coughing]

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:57.844
- [coughing continues]
- [snarls]

01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:59.106
Pardon, pardon me.

01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:03.981
I, um... I come
to make a deal.

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.115
There's a vampire hunter.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.858
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Whoa, now.

01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:14.861
I'd appreciate it if you kept
your distance. For real.

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:19.823
Very well.
But it won't save you.

01:02:20.519 --> 01:02:22.129
You've got one minute.

01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:26.220
There's a vampire hunter.
He's looking for you.

01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:31.617
But I can bring him to you.

01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:34.925
And in return?

01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:36.578
Well, uh...

01:02:37.362 --> 01:02:39.320
At the rate you guys are goin',

01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:40.844
you're gonna run out
of people real soon.

01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:44.499
Put me in charge
of the surviving humans.

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:46.110
Let us rebuild
the population.

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.376
They're too afraid
to deal with you,

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:52.638
but they'll listen to me.

01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:00.037
Bring him to me.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.734
Go.

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.303
[snarls]

01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:17.924
What the hell
just happened over there?

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:19.578
I made a deal.

01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.536
- With him?
- That's right.

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.974
Look, we gotta be
on the winning side of this.

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:27.455
- You sold out the human race.
- Sold 'em out?

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:30.371
You think that vampire hunter's
gonna save us all?

01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.678
He kills one
freshly turned vamp,

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.898
and you wanna make him
your savior, hallelujah!

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:37.074
- But shouldn't we let him try?
- No.

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:40.077
This is a great opportunity.
We can run this country.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.950
All we gotta do is supply
the Master with enough,
um, enough bodies.

01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:45.778
[chuckles] Oh.
Oh, is that all?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.433
That's all.
Look, after all this,

01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:50.957
and you still don't understand
how this world works now?

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:53.568
See, that's why you'll
never be a great leader,

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:56.441
and exactly why I am.
Let's go.

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:07.408
[snarling]

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:11.151
This is all you bring me?

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.850
All I could find,
my Queen.

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.852
There are many empty towns,

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:18.637
with next to nothing
between them.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.118
We have traveled a long way,

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:24.121
with nothing to sustain us.

01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:25.905
We desire blood.

01:04:27.254 --> 01:04:28.647
Well, there's none here.

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.172
When we leave,
we shall find some.

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:34.261
You don't seem hungry.

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:38.918
And your breath
is most fragrant,
as if you've just fed.

01:04:39.527 --> 01:04:42.661
Unless my senses deceive me
after our difficult...

01:04:42.704 --> 01:04:44.619
[snarling]

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:48.972
Do you accuse
our Queen of lying?

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.017
No, no.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:55.065
And if it seems that way,
please forgive me.

01:04:55.108 --> 01:04:58.677
Once we feed,
we'll be more civil.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.983
We will find some,

01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:03.856
but for now, we stay.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.771
Stay? Why?

01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:09.601
The battle is upon us.
We should go.

01:05:09.644 --> 01:05:11.429
There is a hunter coming.

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:14.562
When he dies, we go.

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:18.610
What human requires
all of us to kill him?

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.874
One of us can stay.
That should be enough.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.442
The Master wants
to do it personally.

01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:27.924
Then he can stay
and rest of us can move on.

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:30.927
We can leave this barren
wasteland behind.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.626
The Master wants us all to stay.

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.628
Where is the Master?

01:05:37.672 --> 01:05:42.590
He is resting,
just like you should be,
after your long journey.

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:44.027
We wish to speak with him.

01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:46.725
We will not keep him long.

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:49.075
Maybe we should disturb him.

01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:52.252
I'm sure he would be
overjoyed to see you.

01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:55.342
[snarls]

01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:57.431
Go! Go rest.

01:05:57.475 --> 01:05:59.956
There are many things
to be discussed.

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:02.654
Mm. There are more
of you coming.

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:05.657
When they arrive, we talk.

01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:07.876
When?

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.617
[snarls]

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:13.317
When your Queen decides,
and not before.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.101
[growls]

01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:16.798
- Go!
- [growls]

01:06:19.279 --> 01:06:21.673
We have traveled
all this way.

01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:24.676
Treated like slaves.

01:06:24.719 --> 01:06:28.854
And yet we're forbidden to enter
the Master's house?

01:06:28.897 --> 01:06:30.421
They were there.

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.379
I could smell them.

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:35.426
I smelled the blood
on her breath.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.210
They are there.

01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:40.170
But it has been decided
they are not for us.

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:44.913
We're kept outside
and starved like dogs?

01:06:44.957 --> 01:06:47.307
We should threaten to leave.

01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:50.354
That will bring
the Master to us.

01:06:50.397 --> 01:06:53.618
It will also bring
with it his wrath.

01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:57.361
She cannot keep us
from the Master forever.

01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:01.539
[chair creaks]

01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:04.194
Rest now.

01:07:10.287 --> 01:07:11.853
[crickets chirping]

01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:13.029
Careful.

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.510
Great news,
vampire hunter.

01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:19.774
- You found them?
- Well, uh, not exactly.

01:07:19.818 --> 01:07:21.820
But three of my guys
went into an old ghost town

01:07:21.863 --> 01:07:24.301
not too far from here,
only one came back.

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:26.738
I think it's safe to say
we found your spot.

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:30.263
Now, what we need to do
is pack everybody up,

01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:33.310
we head down there
and we kick
some bloodsucker ass.

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:36.574
Well, wouldn't it be best
if we went tomorrow morning?

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.010
They're strongest at night.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.882
Well, uh, see,
that's the beauty of the plan.

01:07:41.883 --> 01:07:43.320
Won't be expecting us.

01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.279
Don't mind Mr. Rico.

01:07:47.237 --> 01:07:48.238
He's loyal.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.718
That's a good word, right?

01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:52.894
I best get ready.

01:07:54.548 --> 01:07:55.593
Stay cool, Rico.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.075
Loyal dogs get put down, man.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.563
Somethin' isn't right.

01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:11.217
You're gonna have
to sit this one out.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.263
What's the matter?

01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:15.395
Our friends out there
have the look of guilt.

01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:17.963
They can't be selling you out.
That makes no sense.

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.878
Maybe not,
but after we're gone,

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:22.489
you pack and head
in the opposite direction.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.317
No, no way.

01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:26.841
I told you we were going
to help and we are.

01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:28.452
You know this ghost town?

01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:31.063
I reckon I know
what he's talking about.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.457
You give me two hours,

01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:35.676
then get there unseen.

01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:39.027
If what you say is true,

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.682
it could be
all over with by then.

01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:43.858
That's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:47.427
[sighs]

01:08:49.342 --> 01:08:51.475
When this is over,
we're gonna run this country!

01:08:51.518 --> 01:08:52.867
[militia] Yeah!

01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:55.043
- No more vampire problems!
- [militia cheers]

01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:56.871
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:59.309
- This is gonna be
our country now!
- [militia] Yeah!

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:02.703
- We will be in charge!
- [militia] Yeah!

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:06.011
- And we will run
the human race!
- [militia] Yeah!

01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:07.534
And we're here to join you.

01:09:08.622 --> 01:09:10.711
Oh, yeah. About that.

01:09:12.409 --> 01:09:14.367
- Take 'em.
- What--

01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:18.632
Get the women too.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:21.896
- Why the women? You said--
- Man, shut your ass up!

01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.028
But you said...

01:09:28.686 --> 01:09:31.254
You asshole.

01:09:31.297 --> 01:09:34.126
That I am. Tie 'em up.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.475
[grunts]

01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:38.913
Rico. Charlie. Relax.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.180
If he gives you
any more problems,
put a bullet in his head.

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.096
Loyal dogs get put down.

01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:50.969
[lighter flicks]

01:09:52.797 --> 01:09:54.407
I had faith in you.

01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:57.280
Make me understand
why you betrayed me.

01:09:58.106 --> 01:10:00.239
Because I don't have faith
in you, vampire hunter.

01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:05.462
I've seen the Master
and you can't beat him.

01:10:06.724 --> 01:10:08.987
And besides,
I kinda got this thing.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.642
I like being
on the winning side.

01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:15.211
At what cost?

01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:16.951
Your soul?

01:10:18.388 --> 01:10:19.650
Please.

01:10:19.693 --> 01:10:21.086
Bought and paid for.

01:10:21.129 --> 01:10:22.392
A long time ago.

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:24.524
That's why I'm still here.

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:27.832
Can't argue with that.

01:10:32.924 --> 01:10:34.142
I brought you
what I promised.

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:35.970
And some.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.104
[snarls] Send him over.

01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:40.932
[fingers snap]

01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:46.851
[tense music playing]

01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:03.520
[chain clinks]

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:07.393
John.

01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:11.528
All that you've been through,

01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:14.792
all that you've seen...

01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:19.492
and you still believe?

01:11:22.452 --> 01:11:23.931
How is that reasonable?

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.021
Are you judging me,

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:29.285
or my faith?

01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:33.985
You carry the faith
of an empire

01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:40.470
that has murdered every
single one of its prophets.

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.777
And if you persist, John,

01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:46.563
it'll be the same for you.

01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:51.219
This isn't going
to be quick, my friend.

01:11:52.177 --> 01:11:55.615
Every day, you'll grow
weaker and weaker,

01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:59.097
until you no longer care
if you live or die.

01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:03.710
And die you will.

01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:05.625
Not so confident,
are you now, Hunter?

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:06.800
Be silent!

01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:11.109
Does it hurt you so much

01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:14.330
that I've chosen to live?

01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:21.380
Having a bad day today, are we?

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:23.382
Screw you.

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:25.123
[chuckles]

01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:26.690
Yeah, whatever.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.953
I know I got a sweet ride

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:31.347
waitin' for me back there,
motherfucker.

01:12:34.132 --> 01:12:35.960
Your mom was a sweet ride.

01:12:40.834 --> 01:12:42.270
Put him in the cellar.

01:12:46.449 --> 01:12:47.754
You can have
this one as well.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.626
What do you think
you're doing?

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:53.412
This is wrong!
This is all wrong
and you know it!

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.154
This man is our only hope
for survival!

01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:58.374
False hope, you mean.

01:13:01.594 --> 01:13:02.726
Keep him alive.

01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:05.206
As long as he doesn't do
anything stupid.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:07.078
No matter what.

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:13.345
My lord.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.347
We should finish them now.

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:17.654
They are too great a risk.

01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:19.699
Especially the hunter.

01:13:21.048 --> 01:13:22.310
Those two.

01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:25.226
Do you?

01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:27.446
Speak again,

01:13:28.142 --> 01:13:29.796
and I will tear
your tongue out.

01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:31.537
Leave.

01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:36.063
[footsteps recede]

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:39.806
[snarling]

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.599
- This one's mine.
- All yours.

01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:51.557
- No! No!
- What the fuck?

01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:53.080
Fuck off my sister, you--

01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.821
Hey, no! [grunts]

01:13:54.865 --> 01:13:57.128
- [groans]
- Whoa.

01:13:57.171 --> 01:13:59.435
- [yells]
- I can't wait to tear
into you tonight.

01:13:59.478 --> 01:14:01.915
[laughs, groans]

01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:04.222
Charlie. Be still.

01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:05.441
Make a move, Hunter,

01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.835
and I will not hesitate.

01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:38.909
About your deal.

01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:41.738
[snarl]

01:14:42.869 --> 01:14:44.523
I don't make deals.

01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:46.569
- I take.
- [grunts]

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:48.788
- [flesh squelches]
- [screaming]

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.008
Filthy vermin,
prepare to die!

01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:52.357
They're flanking us!

01:14:59.364 --> 01:15:01.758
You will be mine.

01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:02.802
[gunshot]

01:15:04.804 --> 01:15:06.023
[chuckles]

01:15:06.066 --> 01:15:07.111
[gunshot]

01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:11.898
Submit to our will, now!

01:15:11.942 --> 01:15:14.031
And we will be merciful.

01:15:14.074 --> 01:15:15.815
- [snarling]
- [screaming]

01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:20.472
- [grunting]
- [gunshot]

01:15:22.996 --> 01:15:27.479
Your leader has fallen,
and you are doomed
to follow him!

01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:30.874
[screaming and yelling]

01:15:32.919 --> 01:15:34.486
- [grunts]
- [vampire snarls]

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.707
Your adrenaline will only make
your blood taste sweeter.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.447
I can almost taste it now!

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:40.971
All you're gonna taste
is my knife.

01:15:41.014 --> 01:15:42.842
All right then, bitch.
Let's see what you got.

01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:44.235
- [whooshes]
- [grunts]

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:47.760
- [flesh squelches]
- [groans, screams]

01:15:47.804 --> 01:15:49.196
Where you think
you're goin'?

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.199
Get the fuck off me,
you fucker!

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:53.897
- [screams]
- [militia] Get her!

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.378
- [screaming continues]
- [yelling]

01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:02.819
What are you
gonna do now, hero?

01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:05.865
I'm gettin' outta here.
That's what I'm doin'.
Now back up.

01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:07.780
You need to help us.
You're one of us.

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:10.304
I'm not with you.
I'm with me and that's that.

01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:12.698
If you leave us, you're
gonna end up
becoming one of them!

01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:15.092
We're in this together.
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:16:15.135 --> 01:16:17.442
I need a human shield
and you are it,
honey, let's go.

01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:19.575
- [screams]
- Shut up!

01:16:19.618 --> 01:16:21.098
Take me,
I'm better cover!

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.708
Yeah, and you're
more trouble too.

01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:25.232
- Shut up! [groans]
- [screams] I don't wanna go!

01:16:25.276 --> 01:16:26.364
- [grunts]
- [flesh squelches]

01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:32.413
- [sharp thudding]
- [woman sobbing]

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:34.677
[body clunks]

01:16:35.852 --> 01:16:38.158
- Charlie. Charlie!
- [rapid sharp thuds]

01:16:38.202 --> 01:16:39.246
Charlie!

01:16:40.073 --> 01:16:41.074
Save your breath.

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:42.946
You're gonna need it.

01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:44.556
Cut us loose.

01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:46.297
[Lena] Thank you.

01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:49.909
Come get this,
bloodsucker.

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:50.997
[whoosh]

01:16:52.869 --> 01:16:54.740
- [groans]
- [blood splatters]

01:16:56.873 --> 01:16:59.963
You kill one of mine?
You will take his place.

01:17:00.006 --> 01:17:02.008
- Not today!
- Next!

01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:06.447
So now what?

01:17:06.491 --> 01:17:09.102
Now we find the leader.
We kill him.

01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:11.191
Where's my crossbow?

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:12.802
Torque brought it,
just to make sure

01:17:12.845 --> 01:17:14.368
the Master knew your existence.

01:17:14.412 --> 01:17:16.066
I need it now.

01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:17.589
We need weapons.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.677
You take his.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.767
Leave it to me.
I'm a thief, remember?

01:17:21.811 --> 01:17:22.812
Go on, then.

01:17:24.727 --> 01:17:26.206
What about us?

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.860
It's best you stay here.
It's safer.

01:17:27.904 --> 01:17:31.342
If you get some weapons,
will you bring some
back down to us?

01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:32.517
I'll do that.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.127
They'll work
against the militia.

01:17:34.171 --> 01:17:35.433
Not against those animals.

01:17:36.216 --> 01:17:37.565
Am I gonna be okay?

01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:39.480
I don't wanna be one of them.

01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:41.134
Can't tell.

01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:43.397
You haven't turned yet.
That's good.

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:47.924
If the militia get here,
you fight like hell.

01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:50.796
[snarling]

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:02.895
I will destroy you!

01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:04.854
[panting]

01:18:12.992 --> 01:18:15.821
I got weapons.
She saw me, though.

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:18.258
- They know.
- Better find the girls.

01:18:19.346 --> 01:18:20.957
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:29.356
The Master will be pleased
I killed his nemesis.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.271
You speak too soon.

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:33.404
Your arrogance amuses me.

01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:35.014
I've killed many
like you before.

01:18:35.058 --> 01:18:37.887
You haven't dealt
with anybody like me before.

01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:42.761
- [snarls]
- [Charlie] John!

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:47.505
- [crossbow fires]
- [snarls]

01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:51.901
- [groans]
- [body clunks]

01:18:51.944 --> 01:18:52.989
Motherfu...

01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:58.211
John.

01:18:58.864 --> 01:18:59.778
John?

01:19:01.127 --> 01:19:02.738
[groans] Oh...

01:19:03.826 --> 01:19:05.218
Ain't you got
somethin' to do?

01:19:06.654 --> 01:19:08.395
Go. Go!

01:19:11.355 --> 01:19:13.836
[vampire] I shall
make you one of us!

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:17.883
And we will be together
for all eternity! [laughs]

01:19:17.927 --> 01:19:19.580
I would rather die!

01:19:19.624 --> 01:19:23.410
Oh, you will feel so different
once you have changed.

01:19:23.454 --> 01:19:24.455
Never!

01:19:24.977 --> 01:19:27.240
Get away from her,
you fuckin' bitch.

01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:29.765
[snarling]

01:19:31.288 --> 01:19:34.334

[flesh squelches]

01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:38.556
Take that bitch away!

01:19:38.599 --> 01:19:40.123
[Brooke] I've felt acorns
bigger than you.

01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:42.168
- [thuds]
- [LaCroix groans]

01:19:42.212 --> 01:19:43.430
Get off her, fucker!

- [grunts]
- [thudding]

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:47.695

- [grunts, thuds]
- [clangs]

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.571
[Destias] Pathetic.

01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:57.009
Give up and accept your fate!

01:19:57.053 --> 01:20:00.839
You are like rat
trying to fight with a tiger.

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:06.105
And the rat always dies
a useless death,
soon forgotten!

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:09.500

01:20:20.293 --> 01:20:21.860
I should've killed you.

01:20:21.904 --> 01:20:24.341
Yes. You should have.

01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:31.130
[grunting]

01:20:31.174 --> 01:20:32.218

You're out.

01:21:04.555 --> 01:21:06.209
And you have lost, John.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.865
This was always going
to end just one way.

01:21:11.257 --> 01:21:13.912
And that cross
will never save you.

01:21:15.087 --> 01:21:16.349
Let us stand together,

01:21:17.437 --> 01:21:18.874
in the abyss, John.

01:21:19.613 --> 01:21:20.701
Embrace me.

01:21:22.529 --> 01:21:23.748
In infinity.

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:28.535
Think how powerful
we will be together.

How you doin' there, boss?

01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:55.361
[wheezing continues]

01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:04.631

[sobs]

01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:19.995
I knew you could handle it.

01:23:22.301 --> 01:23:23.781
Daddy would be proud.

01:23:25.304 --> 01:23:26.218
[sobs]

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:28.612
Hey, John.

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:32.355
I'm gonna take
a final ride.

01:23:33.704 --> 01:23:34.792
If I need you,

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:37.664
I'll find you.

01:23:42.365 --> 01:23:43.322
John.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:45.020
What's next?

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:51.069
I have no idea.

01:23:53.376 --> 01:23:55.030
[Ultimate Master groaning]

01:24:05.692 --> 01:24:06.954

[panting]

01:24:09.957 --> 01:24:12.699
He is-- he is dead!

01:24:13.439 --> 01:24:14.571
Who is, Master?

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.880
My apprentice.

01:24:19.924 --> 01:24:22.187

The one who dared...

[heavy breathing]

01:24:23.362 --> 01:24:26.191
...to challenge me.

01:24:26.887 --> 01:24:30.152
After all these centuries,
he's finally dead.

01:24:30.891 --> 01:24:33.329
So now there'll be
no battle?

01:24:34.504 --> 01:24:36.375
That's-- that's right.

01:24:36.419 --> 01:24:38.116
[exhales] That's right.

01:24:38.943 --> 01:24:39.987
No battle.

The world is ours!
