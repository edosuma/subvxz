WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:04.370
NYLER: That's my son there,
Marshall.

00:04.404 --> 00:06.006
He looks like a great kid.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.841
NYLER: Yeah, well,
I wouldn't know.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.042
You know,
he was three months old

00:09.075 --> 00:10.844
when I began my term.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.178
My wife remarried,

00:12.212 --> 00:15.616
and he was raised by, um,

00:15.649 --> 00:17.618
you know,
he thinks of his stepdad

00:17.651 --> 00:19.820
as his father.
Oh.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.855
NYLER: No, hey, I mean,
I owe the guy, really.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.290
You know,
he's been a pretty good dad.

00:26.492 --> 00:27.460
Hey.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.608
They're willing to move
for a finding

00:41.642 --> 00:43.176
of your legal innocence.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.478
That's it?

00:45.512 --> 00:46.479
No money?

00:47.648 --> 00:48.882
No.

00:48.915 --> 00:51.084
Fifteen years for a murder
I didn't do,

00:51.117 --> 00:52.152
they offer nothing?

00:52.185 --> 00:54.154
They don't feel
they were negligent,

00:54.187 --> 00:56.256
plus, the state doesn't like
to admit mistakes.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.825
It goes to a fear
of getting sued.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.702
Why haven't they moved
for a legal finding on their own

01:01.735 --> 01:02.769
long before now?

01:02.803 --> 01:04.538
As I said,

01:04.571 --> 01:07.574
they don't like to formally
acknowledge mistakes.

01:07.608 --> 01:10.043
So, if we continue on,

01:10.076 --> 01:11.411
can we win?

01:11.444 --> 01:13.079
Honestly, I don't know.

01:13.113 --> 01:14.848
They'll claim,
given all the evidence,

01:14.881 --> 01:16.282
your arrest was reasonable.

01:16.316 --> 01:18.418
After that, it was a jury

01:18.451 --> 01:20.353
that convicted you.

01:20.386 --> 01:22.623
We obviously can't sue them.

01:23.056 --> 01:24.424
We won't win.

01:24.858 --> 01:26.392
I don't think so.

01:26.426 --> 01:29.195
Bobby,
I know that you took this

01:29.229 --> 01:31.131
on a contingency,

01:31.164 --> 01:33.667
and 33% of nothing isn't much.

01:35.636 --> 01:37.103
But given...

01:37.137 --> 01:39.673
that I did fifteen years,

01:40.874 --> 01:42.408
I would like to at least

01:42.442 --> 01:44.244
give them three days...

01:44.277 --> 01:45.612
of hell.

01:50.884 --> 01:52.018
A summons?

01:52.052 --> 01:54.087
DONNELL: I need you
to testify.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.656
Why?
Because you were the D. A.

01:55.689 --> 01:57.190
who prosecuted him, Ken.

01:57.223 --> 01:58.525
It was one
of our first trials,

01:58.559 --> 02:00.501
when our relationship
was formed, remember?

02:00.534 --> 02:02.235
You blaming me?

02:02.268 --> 02:03.937
I'm certainly not blaming.

02:03.970 --> 02:05.839
I'm just exploring
how an innocent man

02:05.872 --> 02:07.674
ended up serving 15 years.

02:07.708 --> 02:08.908
Look...

02:08.942 --> 02:10.511
I've spent a lot
of money in therapy,

02:10.544 --> 02:11.311
you piece of crap

02:11.344 --> 02:13.346
and I'm trying now
to be nice.

02:13.379 --> 02:15.582
I've held out an olive branch
to your firm.

02:15.616 --> 02:17.183
If you intend
to thrash me with it--

02:17.216 --> 02:18.585
That isn't the case.

02:18.618 --> 02:20.621
I just want your take.

02:20.654 --> 02:21.855
My take.

02:23.524 --> 02:26.660
You come after me,
I'll fillet you, Bobby,

02:26.693 --> 02:28.662
right in the courtroom
for the jury to see.

02:29.796 --> 02:31.965
I can see those
therapy dollars at work.

02:31.998 --> 02:33.466
Don't do this.

02:33.499 --> 02:35.268
That's a warning.

02:35.301 --> 02:36.937
You have your summons.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.338
I'll see you in court.

02:40.674 --> 02:42.175
(paper crumpling)

02:42.208 --> 02:46.146
(music playing)

03:32.599 --> 03:35.468
(sighs)

03:39.405 --> 03:40.574
Everything okay?

03:41.174 --> 03:42.175
(sighs)

03:43.710 --> 03:44.645
No.

03:44.678 --> 03:45.712
Will you argue?

03:45.746 --> 03:46.713
What?

03:46.747 --> 03:48.081
I'm over my head.

03:48.114 --> 03:50.416
I'm going up against
John Wicker

03:50.450 --> 03:52.152
from Goodman.

03:52.185 --> 03:53.920
Do you believe that?
They've got Wicker.

04:02.603 --> 04:04.037
You said you were ready.

04:04.070 --> 04:05.271
I am,

04:05.305 --> 04:06.573
but let's face it, Lindsay,

04:06.607 --> 04:07.941
I'm suing a town

04:07.974 --> 04:09.676
for having a soccer program.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.344
Add to that, I've been
to court twice

04:11.377 --> 04:12.345
in my entire life.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.014
Add to that
they've got Wicker.

04:14.047 --> 04:16.817
Add to that--
Are you okay?

04:16.850 --> 04:18.885
Lindsay, sometimes...

04:20.821 --> 04:23.156
I sort of freeze.

04:23.557 --> 04:24.625
What do you mean?

04:24.658 --> 04:26.827
When I get nervous or--

04:28.595 --> 04:29.596
I'll be fine.

04:30.597 --> 04:31.665
I'll be fine.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.703
The victim was a 70 year-old
retired school teacher,

04:36.736 --> 04:39.438
robbed, beaten to death
with a wrench.

04:39.472 --> 04:41.241
I was lead detective
on the case.

04:41.274 --> 04:43.777
DONNELL: And, Detective,
what led you to conclude

04:43.810 --> 04:45.912
that Lewis Nyler
was the killer?

04:45.946 --> 04:49.049
Two eyewitnesses gave
a description matching his,

04:49.082 --> 04:50.751
one picked him out
of a lineup,

04:50.784 --> 04:52.285
he had no alibi,

04:52.318 --> 04:54.120
his wrench
was the murder weapon,

04:54.688 --> 04:56.122
and he confessed.

04:56.156 --> 04:57.958
He initially maintained
his innocence.

04:57.991 --> 04:58.959
They all do.

04:58.992 --> 05:01.668
DONNELL: But this one
was innocent.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.607
At what point
during your interrogation

05:06.640 --> 05:07.941
did my client confess?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.676
Approximately 28 hours.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.245
He was in that room

05:12.278 --> 05:15.549
for 28 straight hours?
Yes.

05:15.582 --> 05:16.817
You basically wore him down?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.719
The confession was voluntary.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.822
Detective, a month after
my client was convicted,

05:21.855 --> 05:24.124
another man confessed
to the killing,

05:24.157 --> 05:24.958
isn't that right?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.293
A man by the name
of Mark Carter?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.729
PEGLER: Unfortunately,
we didn't think

05:28.762 --> 05:30.831
that confession was credible.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.398
I thought he was trying
to make a deal

05:32.432 --> 05:34.067
on a different murder
he'd been charged with.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.869
And last year,

05:36.503 --> 05:38.371
15 years later,

05:38.404 --> 05:41.642
you finally did a DNA analysis
on the wrench,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.009
didn't you?
Yes.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.245
And what did that analysis
tell you?

05:45.278 --> 05:48.448
That Mark Carter was,
indeed, the killer.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.717
We apologize.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.354
Can't you make a call

05:54.387 --> 05:55.922
and tell them I'm dead
or something?

05:55.956 --> 05:58.124
They've cracked down
on jury duty now.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.567
It's not so easy
to get out of.

06:00.601 --> 06:02.503
Well, what about
something medical?

06:02.536 --> 06:04.805
Well, what have you got,
hemorrhoids?

06:04.838 --> 06:05.939
Well, does that work?

06:05.972 --> 06:07.541
Because I can get one.

06:08.141 --> 06:09.976
Hello, I'm looking
for Lindsay Dole.

06:10.010 --> 06:11.344
Is she here, by any chance?

06:11.377 --> 06:13.514
No, she actually
doesn't work here anymore,

06:13.547 --> 06:15.048
but her office is right--
Yes, I know.

06:15.081 --> 06:16.750
I worked
with her temporarily.

06:16.783 --> 06:18.151
My name's Claire Wyatt.

06:18.184 --> 06:18.985
More about that later.

06:19.019 --> 06:20.053
Do you know where she is?

06:20.453 --> 06:21.555
No.

06:21.588 --> 06:22.956
Have you tried her daycare?

06:22.989 --> 06:24.290
Right.

06:24.324 --> 06:25.458
Thank you.

06:32.599 --> 06:33.634
WYATT: Oh, Lindsay,

06:34.568 --> 06:36.136
they wanna meet.

06:36.169 --> 06:37.971
DOLE: Who?
The defendant,

06:38.004 --> 06:39.740
the Town of Lexington,
they wanna meet.

06:39.773 --> 06:40.807
They must have an offer.

06:40.841 --> 06:42.543
DOLE: Let's not jump
to conclusions.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.977
Why else would they want
a conference,

06:44.010 --> 06:45.646
to discuss spring fashions?

06:45.679 --> 06:46.913
They even agreed
to come here.

06:46.947 --> 06:48.448
They must have an offer.

06:48.481 --> 06:49.382
DOLE: Okay.

06:49.415 --> 06:51.051
Well, if they
wanna discuss settlement,

06:51.084 --> 06:52.118
it's best not to appear

06:52.152 --> 06:53.854
overanxious.
Right.

06:53.887 --> 06:55.989
And I'm sure
it goes without saying,

06:56.022 --> 06:57.791
try not to freeze
or vomit.

06:57.824 --> 06:59.059
Right.

07:00.901 --> 07:02.168
(sighs)

07:02.202 --> 07:03.469
That was hurtful.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.575
I have never
knowingly prosecuted

07:08.609 --> 07:09.810
an innocent man.

07:09.843 --> 07:12.278
But you knew
about another man

07:12.312 --> 07:13.847
who confessed
to being the killer,

07:13.880 --> 07:15.749
a man by the name
of Mark Carter.

07:15.782 --> 07:17.518
I heard that allegation

07:17.551 --> 07:19.185
soon after the trial,

07:19.219 --> 07:20.320
but I didn't believe it.

07:20.353 --> 07:23.023
Did you interview
Mr. Carter?

07:23.056 --> 07:24.457
As I said,
I didn't believe him

07:24.490 --> 07:25.592
to be telling the truth.

07:25.626 --> 07:27.828
Did you interview him?

07:27.861 --> 07:29.696
The prosecutor
doesn't beat the bushes

07:29.730 --> 07:31.297
for new witnesses,
counsel.

07:31.331 --> 07:32.966
I rely on the police
for that.

07:32.999 --> 07:35.268
They said this Mr. Carter
was a liar.

07:35.301 --> 07:37.871
And that's what you told
the parole board six years ago,

07:37.904 --> 07:39.806
when you urged them to deny

07:39.840 --> 07:41.307
Lewis Nyler's parole.

07:41.341 --> 07:42.375
WALSH: Yes,

07:42.408 --> 07:45.546
but once the Innocence Project
did the DNA test,

07:45.579 --> 07:47.113
we did vacate his conviction,

07:47.147 --> 07:48.782
which I, of course,
fully supported.

07:48.815 --> 07:52.485
DONNELL: After he served
15 years in prison

07:52.519 --> 07:54.387
for a crime
he didn't commit.

07:54.420 --> 07:56.422
WALSH: Hey, I wish
we had money

07:56.456 --> 07:58.258
to spot-check
every conviction

07:58.291 --> 08:00.867
to make sure
this never happens again.

08:01.401 --> 08:02.368
WALSH: We don't.

08:02.402 --> 08:03.804
DONNELL: How about just
interviewing the people

08:03.837 --> 08:05.338
who confessed to the crime?

08:07.340 --> 08:08.675
Did you interview him?

08:09.543 --> 08:11.311
I didn't know about him.
Why not?

08:11.344 --> 08:12.979
Did you follow up
on the case, counsel,

08:13.013 --> 08:14.681
or did you just move on

08:14.715 --> 08:17.017
once your client got convicted?
Move to strike.

08:17.050 --> 08:18.218
You're the defense attorney

08:18.251 --> 08:20.186
and you're coming after me,
the prosecutor,

08:20.220 --> 08:21.254
for not being zealous enough

08:21.287 --> 08:23.156
in securing
your client's freedom.

08:23.189 --> 08:24.858
Am I the only one
who thinks that's funny?

08:24.891 --> 08:25.992
All right, Mr. Walsh.

08:26.026 --> 08:27.293
Your Honor...

08:28.128 --> 08:29.262
just like to say,

08:29.295 --> 08:31.532
as the D. A.
who prosecuted this man,

08:31.565 --> 08:33.799
I have a heavy heart.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.001
I don't deny it

08:35.034 --> 08:37.136
but what about his heart?
Move to strike!

08:37.169 --> 08:39.239
WALSH: Where was he
to request the DNA tests?

08:39.272 --> 08:40.774
But for the Project Innocence,

08:40.807 --> 08:42.543
his client would still
be locked up.

08:42.576 --> 08:43.844
DONNELL: Move to strike!

08:43.876 --> 08:45.946
All right,
let's just move on.

08:51.885 --> 08:53.253
What do you mean no studies?

08:53.286 --> 08:54.521
I can't find any.

08:54.555 --> 08:55.989
In fact,
the Department of Justice

08:56.022 --> 08:57.624
doesn't even track the statistic

08:57.658 --> 08:59.459
of how many people
are falsely convicted.

08:59.492 --> 09:00.567
That's impossible.

09:00.601 --> 09:01.768
Bobby, next to looks,

09:01.802 --> 09:03.303
I pride myself
on my research and--

09:03.336 --> 09:05.005
Rebecca, can you help
Jamie out, please?

09:05.038 --> 09:06.406
Did you try the N. I. J.?

09:06.439 --> 09:07.908
They documented some cases,

09:07.941 --> 09:09.910
but there was nothing
to overall patterns.

09:09.943 --> 09:12.946
Bobby, let's face it,
this case is a dog.

09:12.979 --> 09:16.149
I realize that, Eugene,
but the client wants to try it.

09:16.182 --> 09:17.918
WASHINGTON:
I forget who said it,

09:17.951 --> 09:20.554
but somebody here
recently kind of screamed at us

09:20.587 --> 09:22.923
to make the client see reason.

09:24.124 --> 09:25.892
Rebecca...

09:25.926 --> 09:29.295
I was the lawyer
who lost this one.

09:29.329 --> 09:32.999
I had an innocent man
go to prison on me.

09:34.034 --> 09:36.570
If he wants me
to do cartwheels for him now,

09:36.603 --> 09:38.905
then that's what I'll do.

09:51.217 --> 09:54.087
And how do you decide
if he should be released?

09:54.120 --> 09:56.122
HODGES: There are a number
of factors.

09:56.156 --> 09:58.859
Is he still a danger
to the community?

09:58.892 --> 10:01.267
Has he bettered himself
in prison?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.869
Has he been rehabilitated?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.605
MAN: And you decided
that Mr. Nyler

10:04.638 --> 10:06.607
was not a good candidate
for release.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.975
Frankly,
he was a terrible candidate.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.043
Why?

10:10.076 --> 10:12.312
His attitude towards us
was angry.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.148
He wouldn't take responsibility
for his situation,

10:15.181 --> 10:17.450
and he didn't give us
the confidence we needed to risk

10:17.483 --> 10:19.152
letting him back out
on the street.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.655
The police and the prosecutors
opposed release,

10:21.688 --> 10:23.890
as well as the victim's family.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.892
This was not a hard call.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.362
My client was a model prisoner,

10:29.395 --> 10:30.731
no disciplinary problems,

10:30.764 --> 10:32.298
correct?
Yes.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.900
The only reason
you wouldn't grant him parole

10:33.934 --> 10:36.970
is because he refused to say
he was the killer.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.939
He showed a profound lack
of remorse

10:38.972 --> 10:40.841
and wouldn't accept
responsibility

10:40.874 --> 10:42.308
for what was a heinous crime.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.877
DONNELL: Well,
that's understandable.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.012
I mean, isn't it?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.480
He was innocent.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.882
HODGES: As it turned out.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.116
Certainly,
we didn't know that.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.719
But you had knowledge
that another man confessed.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.420
HODGES: We had no knowledge

10:54.454 --> 10:56.657
that the confession
was truthful, nor did we have--

10:56.690 --> 10:58.859
DONNELL: And you couldn't be
bothered to find out.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.026
HODGES: Mr. Donnell,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.769
the parole board
does not exist to investigate.

11:02.803 --> 11:04.370
We assume guilt going in.

11:04.404 --> 11:06.039
We have to. Otherwise--

11:06.072 --> 11:08.675
DONNELL: You denied
my client parole

11:08.709 --> 11:10.443
because he told the truth.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.280
An innocent man
served extra time in jail

11:14.314 --> 11:16.316
simply because he maintained
his innocence.

11:16.349 --> 11:18.919
In this case,
as it worked out, yes.

11:18.952 --> 11:19.786
And that's regrettable.

11:19.820 --> 11:21.121
DONNELL: Regrettable?

11:21.154 --> 11:23.489
Don't you think it's perverse?

11:23.524 --> 11:27.193
He served extra time
for being truthful.

11:27.227 --> 11:29.062
Mistakes were made
in this case,

11:29.095 --> 11:30.163
but none of them were ours.

11:30.196 --> 11:32.633
We did our job
as the law required.

11:32.666 --> 11:36.102
As the law required.

11:36.136 --> 11:37.938
Ms. Hodges...

11:37.971 --> 11:40.807
had you been armed
with the DNA evidence

11:40.841 --> 11:43.309
that conclusively proved
my client's innocence,

11:43.343 --> 11:46.346
would you have then
granted him parole?

11:48.048 --> 11:49.182
No.

11:50.517 --> 11:51.652
No?

11:51.685 --> 11:54.020
If your client
was still in prison,

11:54.054 --> 11:56.022
refusing to accept
responsibility,

11:56.056 --> 11:58.825
DNA evidence or not,
we'd have no choice.

11:58.859 --> 12:00.767
We would have
denied him parole.

12:05.506 --> 12:07.273
WICKER: I must say,
I'm only here

12:07.307 --> 12:09.442
at the insistence
of a charitable mayor.

12:09.475 --> 12:11.411
Against my better judgment,

12:11.444 --> 12:12.913
which is expensive,
by the way,

12:12.946 --> 12:15.716
I'm putting $35,000
on the table,

12:15.749 --> 12:17.918
condition, of course,
on confidentiality.

12:17.951 --> 12:19.786
Thirty-five thousand?

12:19.820 --> 12:21.588
He has learning disabilities.

12:21.622 --> 12:23.557
Ms. Wyatt, I don't think
you want the number

12:23.590 --> 12:24.958
to reflect the merits
of your case,

12:24.991 --> 12:26.560
because we all know
what that number is.

12:27.628 --> 12:29.362
Well, if this
is all about charity,

12:29.395 --> 12:31.532
why would the mayor
wanna keep it such a secret?

12:31.565 --> 12:33.466
Most politicians
like photo ops

12:33.499 --> 12:34.801
with their acts of kindness.

12:34.835 --> 12:36.803
The secrecy
is at my insistence.

12:36.837 --> 12:39.305
What would happen
if every child

12:39.339 --> 12:40.774
who ever headed a soccer ball

12:40.807 --> 12:42.576
came calling
to collect a check?

12:42.609 --> 12:44.210
I would think
if the children

12:44.244 --> 12:45.912
had neurological deficits

12:45.946 --> 12:48.114
caused by town-sponsored
programs,

12:48.148 --> 12:50.316
a town would consider
compensating them.

12:50.350 --> 12:52.753
The $35,000
is on the table today.

12:52.786 --> 12:55.155
It won't be, should you lose
at summary judgment.

12:55.822 --> 12:57.524
Now, I won't advise
either of you

12:57.558 --> 12:58.625
how to practice law.

12:58.659 --> 12:59.926
You're both good attorneys.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.570
But I will say,
come on, do the math.

13:03.604 --> 13:06.172
Thirty-five is better
than nothing.

13:08.509 --> 13:09.643
WICKER: What are you thinking?

13:10.911 --> 13:12.012
Ms. Wyatt?

13:12.846 --> 13:14.380
We'll take the offer
to our client,

13:14.414 --> 13:15.481
then let you know.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.722
I just hit her

13:21.755 --> 13:24.324
first with my hand,

13:24.357 --> 13:25.992
then with the wrench.

13:27.293 --> 13:28.929
I don't know how many times,

13:28.962 --> 13:32.265
but I couldn't stop myself

13:32.298 --> 13:34.267
not till...

13:34.300 --> 13:35.936
she was dead.

13:37.504 --> 13:39.940
I just couldn't stop myself.

13:43.510 --> 13:45.345
That was you, Mr. Nyler,

13:46.412 --> 13:47.814
saying that you did it.

13:47.848 --> 13:50.483
I had been in that room
all night.

13:50.517 --> 13:52.385
But were you tortured?

13:52.418 --> 13:54.721
Did any officer beat you or--

13:54.755 --> 13:57.323
It was mental torture.

13:57.357 --> 13:59.325
They kept me awake,

13:59.359 --> 14:01.568
and they said that
they wouldn't let me out

14:01.602 --> 14:02.636
till I confessed.

14:03.269 --> 14:06.607
Finally, I, um...

14:06.640 --> 14:07.641
I gave in.

14:08.775 --> 14:10.511
Mr. Nyler,

14:10.544 --> 14:13.814
when you looked
at that tape just now,

14:13.847 --> 14:16.049
can you make room
for the possibility

14:16.082 --> 14:18.084
that a detective or a jury

14:18.118 --> 14:19.653
or a parole board

14:19.686 --> 14:21.722
might consider you guilty?

14:21.755 --> 14:24.858
They didn't see
what went on before that.

14:26.092 --> 14:27.794
What did go on?

14:28.394 --> 14:30.764
They just kept saying
they knew I did it.

14:30.797 --> 14:33.333
After 20 hours or so,

14:33.366 --> 14:35.969
I was delirious.

14:36.002 --> 14:38.038
I just--

14:38.071 --> 14:39.506
I was sleep-deprived.

14:40.273 --> 14:41.875
I was mentally--

14:45.478 --> 14:46.913
at some point,

14:48.248 --> 14:50.751
I guess you'll say anything

14:50.784 --> 14:52.418
to get them to stop.

14:53.620 --> 14:54.988
And I did.

14:56.056 --> 14:58.258
But the next day,

14:58.291 --> 15:00.734
I told them it was a lie.

15:01.802 --> 15:03.136
I never did it.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.273
But they didn't want
that statement.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.743
They wanted their conviction.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.947
They never looked
for the truth.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.082
I lost my family,

15:17.483 --> 15:18.418
my son,

15:19.586 --> 15:21.522
15 years of my life

15:23.524 --> 15:26.459
because they never looked
for the truth.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.835
Have you ever seen
a doctor for this?

15:34.868 --> 15:37.838
WYATT: Yes, and he said
it's all anxiety.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.906
He suggested
I do breathing exercises.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.408
It's not like I black out.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.177
It's just--

15:44.210 --> 15:45.646
I can't talk.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.448
Look...

15:48.481 --> 15:50.817
you said you wanted
to talk about something.

15:50.851 --> 15:53.319
Yes, and I appreciate
you taking time

15:53.353 --> 15:55.388
out of your busy schedule.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.891
I just--

15:57.924 --> 16:00.500
Lindsay has been giving me
little pep talks

16:00.534 --> 16:02.135
to bolster my confidence,

16:02.168 --> 16:04.538
and, um, well,
she told me your story.

16:04.571 --> 16:05.839
My story?

16:05.872 --> 16:07.641
Yes, how...

16:07.674 --> 16:09.309
a few years ago,

16:09.342 --> 16:10.644
your nickname
was Jimmy The Grunt

16:10.677 --> 16:12.979
and nobody
took you seriously.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.881
Lindsay shared that?

16:14.915 --> 16:16.082
Yes.

16:16.116 --> 16:18.318
And well,

16:18.351 --> 16:19.886
I guess...

16:19.920 --> 16:21.988
I was looking
for some insight,

16:22.022 --> 16:24.958
you know,
on turning the corner.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.962
Well...

16:28.995 --> 16:30.864
with me,

16:30.897 --> 16:32.833
I just made up my mind

16:32.866 --> 16:34.334
I wasn't gonna get knocked down.

16:35.201 --> 16:38.071
I was the first lawyer
in my family, and--

16:39.339 --> 16:42.709
but I didn't have
this freezing problem.

16:43.476 --> 16:45.478
My father's a lawyer.

16:46.713 --> 16:49.516
I think it adds
to the pressure.

16:50.116 --> 16:52.385
I remember the look
on his face

16:52.418 --> 16:54.921
when I told him that
I was going to law school.

16:54.955 --> 16:57.891
And he didn't believe
I was cut out for it.

16:59.225 --> 17:02.869
I think that's partly
why I freeze.

17:06.707 --> 17:08.407
Claire...

17:08.441 --> 17:11.512
maybe you should
really try to settle.

17:15.749 --> 17:16.883
Nothing?

17:16.916 --> 17:18.551
Not a race disparity, even?

17:18.585 --> 17:19.786
For sentencing, yes,

17:19.819 --> 17:21.755
but not for wrongful
convictions.

17:21.788 --> 17:22.923
We're coming up empty.

17:22.955 --> 17:24.190
There was one law review

17:24.223 --> 17:26.492
that figured 10,000 wrongful
convictions a year,

17:26.527 --> 17:27.861
but there's no hard data
on that.

17:27.894 --> 17:31.497
WASHINGTON: Bobby, may I ask
what are you going for?

17:31.532 --> 17:34.701
If you're planning to argue
false convictions are common,

17:34.735 --> 17:36.837
that goes against
your negligence claim.

17:36.870 --> 17:38.705
If you argue
they're not common,

17:38.739 --> 17:40.741
that hurts you
on foreseeability.

17:40.774 --> 17:42.042
What's your case?

17:42.442 --> 17:43.644
I'm not sure.

17:45.045 --> 17:46.813
You're not sure?

17:49.415 --> 17:51.618
The truth is...

17:51.652 --> 17:52.653
Walsh is right.

17:54.254 --> 17:56.590
If anybody's to blame here,
it's probably me.

17:59.359 --> 18:01.802
I pored through that
trial transcript.

18:01.835 --> 18:02.936
You did nothing wrong.

18:02.969 --> 18:04.671
I should've suppressed
that confession.

18:04.705 --> 18:06.006
You tried.
It was voluntary.

18:06.039 --> 18:08.108
And why didn't I push
for DNA testing?

18:08.141 --> 18:09.776
WASHINGTON: Bobby, 15 years ago,
they weren't doing that.

18:09.810 --> 18:11.512
But 10 years ago, they were.

18:18.351 --> 18:19.820
The reality is...

18:22.689 --> 18:23.924
I never went back

18:23.957 --> 18:26.026
because I believed

18:26.059 --> 18:27.561
my client was guilty.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.965
I bought into that confession

18:31.998 --> 18:33.667
just like everybody else.

18:36.503 --> 18:38.772
Not a good thing to bring up
in your closing.

18:45.278 --> 18:46.212
(sigh)

18:53.453 --> 18:55.221
Thirty-five thousand.

18:55.956 --> 18:58.058
It isn't much, but--

18:58.091 --> 19:00.433
My son has
learning disabilities,

19:00.466 --> 19:02.168
attention deficits.

19:02.202 --> 19:05.572
The stumbling block
is liability.

19:05.606 --> 19:08.474
The doctors can't establish
that heading the soccer ball

19:08.509 --> 19:09.810
caused the injuries,

19:09.843 --> 19:12.112
and--
The doctors think it's that,

19:12.145 --> 19:15.549
and I know conclusively
as his mother.

19:15.582 --> 19:17.818
He never had any
of these problems

19:17.851 --> 19:20.554
before the headaches
after the soccer games.

19:20.587 --> 19:23.890
DOLE: There's also assumption
of the risk issues.

19:23.924 --> 19:25.325
BOYD: I never assumed

19:25.358 --> 19:28.595
any risk
of neurological disability

19:28.629 --> 19:30.096
when I let him play soccer.

19:30.130 --> 19:33.600
DOLE: Neither of us
is suggesting that $35,000

19:33.634 --> 19:35.401
will make you
or your son whole.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.003
But you're telling me
to take it.

19:37.037 --> 19:39.005
Because we don't believe
we'll prevail.

19:39.039 --> 19:42.108
I don't think we'll even survive
summary judgment.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.612
Thirty-five won't do it.

19:45.646 --> 19:49.082
Mary...
Thirty-five won't do it.

20:00.026 --> 20:02.736
When I tried this case
15 years ago,

20:02.769 --> 20:04.037
I was a young,

20:04.070 --> 20:05.171
idealistic lawyer

20:05.205 --> 20:07.073
who believed very much

20:07.107 --> 20:08.609
that our criminal-justice system

20:08.642 --> 20:10.343
was the best in the world.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.212
We've heard it said
so many times

20:12.245 --> 20:14.581
that we've almost
come to believe

20:14.615 --> 20:15.849
it's perfect.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.252
Well, it certainly
wasn't perfect for Lewis Nyler.

20:19.285 --> 20:22.022
First, to defend him,
he got a kid

20:22.055 --> 20:24.057
fresh out of law school.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.859
Sure, I'll say it,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.528
I could've,
perhaps should've done

20:27.561 --> 20:29.095
a much better job.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.532
But the truth is,

20:31.565 --> 20:34.434
criminal defendants rarely
get the pick of the litter.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.503
And I was a novice,

20:36.537 --> 20:38.772
looking to pick up experience

20:38.805 --> 20:39.840
and rent money.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.609
Imagine...

20:42.643 --> 20:45.579
being on trial for murder

20:45.612 --> 20:48.949
and having an inexperienced
if not inferior attorney

20:48.982 --> 20:50.851
happens all the time

20:50.884 --> 20:53.419
in our great
criminal justice system.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.522
One would hope, given that,

20:55.556 --> 20:58.559
that the state would take care
to ensure fairness,

20:59.893 --> 21:01.367
one would hope.

21:02.202 --> 21:03.403
Look what the state did here.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.438
First, the parole issue.

21:05.471 --> 21:08.174
Lewis Nyler,
an innocent man,

21:08.208 --> 21:11.712
served an extra six years
in prison

21:11.745 --> 21:14.180
for refusing to say
he was guilty.

21:14.214 --> 21:15.516
Let me say that again.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.585
An innocent man

21:18.619 --> 21:21.021
served additional time

21:21.054 --> 21:23.657
for not admitting guilt.

21:25.091 --> 21:28.128
The perversity of that
speaks for itself.

21:28.562 --> 21:31.732
The even bigger question,

21:31.765 --> 21:34.000
how did an innocent man

21:34.034 --> 21:35.836
end up in prison

21:35.869 --> 21:37.571
to begin with?

21:37.604 --> 21:39.606
We certainly know
it happens,

21:39.640 --> 21:41.542
the Central Park jogger case,

21:41.575 --> 21:44.745
Rampart,
all the reversals from DNA,

21:44.778 --> 21:46.212
and the work
of Project Innocence,

21:46.246 --> 21:47.413
we now know

21:47.447 --> 21:50.183
that people get falsely
convicted a lot.

21:50.216 --> 21:52.753
I hoped to present you
with studies,

21:52.786 --> 21:54.154
but guess what?

21:54.187 --> 21:55.188
There aren't any.

21:55.221 --> 21:57.624
In fact, the United States
Department of Justice

21:57.658 --> 22:00.500
doesn't even track statistics
on how many people

22:00.534 --> 22:02.703
get falsely convicted
every year.

22:02.736 --> 22:03.970
That's outrageous.

22:04.505 --> 22:05.471
Add to that

22:05.506 --> 22:07.608
nobody is trying

22:07.641 --> 22:09.409
to remedy the problem.

22:10.777 --> 22:13.947
With all these overturned
convictions and revelations

22:13.980 --> 22:16.550
of enormous error,
not once

22:16.583 --> 22:18.318
has any court or jurisdiction

22:18.351 --> 22:20.521
gone back and tried
to figure out how it happened.

22:20.554 --> 22:21.788
Your Honor, I'm sorry,

22:21.822 --> 22:23.757
but he's introducing
evidence here.

22:23.790 --> 22:25.191
I'm going to allow it.

22:25.225 --> 22:26.693
DONNELL: In medicine,

22:26.727 --> 22:28.361
if a patient dies, immediately,

22:28.394 --> 22:30.230
a morbidity
and mortality commission

22:30.263 --> 22:32.265
is assembled to figure out how.

22:32.298 --> 22:34.968
If a building collapses,
engineers and architects

22:35.001 --> 22:37.237
convene to ascertain
the cause,

22:37.270 --> 22:38.539
but in criminal justice,

22:38.572 --> 22:40.674
with so many false convictions,

22:40.707 --> 22:43.076
we're doing nothing

22:43.109 --> 22:44.711
to either fix the problem

22:44.745 --> 22:46.847
or even probe the cause,

22:46.880 --> 22:47.948
nothing.

22:47.981 --> 22:48.882
LANDER: All right,
Mr. Donnell.

22:48.915 --> 22:50.283
I think I will ask you

22:50.316 --> 22:52.085
to confine yourself
to this case.

22:53.053 --> 22:54.688
This case

22:56.089 --> 22:58.358
is about governmental arrogance.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.302
An innocent man was thrown
into an interrogation room

23:02.335 --> 23:03.336
and not let out

23:03.369 --> 23:05.371
until he signed
a false confession

23:05.405 --> 23:07.774
28 hours later.

23:07.808 --> 23:10.611
Despite the real killer
confessing to the crime,

23:10.644 --> 23:12.546
Lewis Nyler
continued to serve

23:12.579 --> 23:14.815
15 years in prison,

23:16.349 --> 23:19.019
the last six simply
for insisting

23:19.052 --> 23:20.754
on his innocence.

23:23.189 --> 23:25.659
He lost his family,

23:29.495 --> 23:31.698
a big part of his life,

23:34.768 --> 23:37.538
and the state
offers no compensation,

23:38.805 --> 23:41.207
nor has it so much
as thrown together a panel

23:41.241 --> 23:42.543
to ask how it happened.

23:42.576 --> 23:43.610
That's arrogance.

23:45.311 --> 23:46.647
My fix,

23:48.314 --> 23:50.283
we need a jury

23:50.316 --> 23:52.085
to motivate the state

23:52.118 --> 23:54.054
to re-examine its procedures,

23:54.087 --> 23:56.189
not just for Lewis Nyler's sake,

23:56.222 --> 23:58.258
but for the next
innocent man,

23:58.291 --> 24:00.534
and the next innocent man
after that,

24:00.567 --> 24:02.235
and the one after that.

24:03.637 --> 24:04.971
We need a jury

24:05.005 --> 24:06.840
to motivate the state

24:06.873 --> 24:08.909
to make our criminal
justice system

24:08.942 --> 24:11.845
every bit as good
as it's cracked up to be.

24:14.114 --> 24:15.148
You know, 15 years later,

24:15.181 --> 24:17.383
I still consider myself

24:17.417 --> 24:19.185
an idealistic attorney.

24:21.354 --> 24:23.423
I guess in the spirit

24:23.456 --> 24:26.159
of that idealism,

24:26.192 --> 24:28.862
as well as
in the spirit of simple...

24:28.895 --> 24:30.564
fairness.

24:34.334 --> 24:36.236
I am hoping...

24:38.104 --> 24:40.340
you're that jury.

24:40.373 --> 24:43.309
(music playing)

24:55.756 --> 24:57.490
Very inspiring

24:58.792 --> 25:00.601
but, uh,

25:00.634 --> 25:02.603
let's look
at the merits of the case

25:02.636 --> 25:04.304
instead of the politics.

25:05.506 --> 25:08.174
First, the parole issue,

25:08.208 --> 25:09.643
a parole board exists

25:09.676 --> 25:11.411
not to determine
innocence or guilt,

25:11.444 --> 25:13.146
but to determine
whether a prisoner

25:13.179 --> 25:14.915
is fit for release,

25:14.948 --> 25:16.983
i.e. rehabilitation,

25:17.017 --> 25:18.719
the board assumes guilt.

25:20.053 --> 25:21.421
Occasionally,

25:21.454 --> 25:23.356
that results in an innocent man

25:23.389 --> 25:24.558
being required

25:24.591 --> 25:26.627
to acknowledge guilt for a crime

25:26.660 --> 25:27.694
that he didn't commit,

25:27.728 --> 25:29.495
and that is unfortunate,

25:29.530 --> 25:31.131
but what's the alternative?

25:31.164 --> 25:34.067
No such requirement?

25:34.100 --> 25:36.402
We're going to start
paroling prisoners

25:36.436 --> 25:39.272
who don't express remorse?

25:40.874 --> 25:41.875
You really want that?

25:43.443 --> 25:45.812
As for the bigger question,

25:45.846 --> 25:47.914
how did he end up in jail
to begin with?

25:49.049 --> 25:51.952
A terrible, horrific result,

25:51.985 --> 25:52.953
no argument here,

25:52.986 --> 25:56.156
but whose fault, really?

25:58.058 --> 26:00.834
Lewis Nyler's wrench
was the murder weapon,

26:00.867 --> 26:02.368
two witnesses described him,

26:02.402 --> 26:04.404
one even pulled him out
of a lineup,

26:04.437 --> 26:06.272
and he confessed.

26:06.306 --> 26:07.808
Oh, Mr. Donnell,

26:07.841 --> 26:09.876
he left that out
of his stirring speech.

26:09.910 --> 26:12.312
Lewis Nyler confessed.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.881
And there was nothing illegal

26:14.915 --> 26:16.382
about that confession.

26:16.416 --> 26:18.351
It was constitutional,

26:18.384 --> 26:20.386
voluntary, valid.

26:21.722 --> 26:24.490
So who do we blame?

26:26.693 --> 26:28.929
The witnesses,
who made a mistake?

26:30.030 --> 26:31.331
Good luck.

26:31.364 --> 26:32.999
No witness
will ever come forward again

26:33.033 --> 26:34.568
for fear of being sued.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.070
The police or the prosecutors

26:37.103 --> 26:38.572
for relying on those witnesses,

26:38.605 --> 26:39.973
as well as the other evidence,

26:40.006 --> 26:42.008
including a murder weapon

26:42.042 --> 26:43.744
and a confession?

26:45.411 --> 26:46.680
The parole board for believing

26:46.713 --> 26:48.982
in a prisoner's guilt
post-conviction?

26:51.818 --> 26:53.720
Now, if you are desperate

26:53.754 --> 26:56.523
to find blame here,

26:56.557 --> 26:58.825
you might start with Mr. Nyler.

27:00.567 --> 27:01.735
He lied.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.839
Maybe he was vulnerable
after a lengthy interrogation.

27:05.872 --> 27:07.040
I'll give you that,

27:07.073 --> 27:09.375
but let's face it,
we might not be here

27:09.409 --> 27:12.312
if Lewis Nyler had not signed
that confession,

27:12.345 --> 27:14.915
saying that he committed
the crime.

27:17.050 --> 27:19.753
And as for why the state

27:19.786 --> 27:22.556
hasn't done a better job
asking questions,

27:22.589 --> 27:24.190
analyzing mistakes,

27:24.224 --> 27:27.327
Mr. Donnell certainly
is idealistic.

27:28.529 --> 27:30.263
The reason that our
criminal justice system

27:30.296 --> 27:31.565
is the best in the world

27:31.598 --> 27:33.767
is because it is so thoroughly

27:33.800 --> 27:35.468
adversarial.

27:36.737 --> 27:38.739
The check that we have

27:38.772 --> 27:40.406
against false convictions,

27:40.440 --> 27:42.976
the best check--
the defense attorney.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.347
And I have to ask

27:47.380 --> 27:49.215
if the IDs of those witnesses

27:49.249 --> 27:50.584
were impeachable,

27:50.617 --> 27:52.452
if that confession

27:52.485 --> 27:53.954
was suspect,

27:53.987 --> 27:56.189
if that DNA existed

27:56.222 --> 27:58.725
for 15 years,

27:58.759 --> 28:01.602
where, I ask, was his lawyer?

28:04.370 --> 28:06.139
Now,

28:06.172 --> 28:08.074
if Mr. Donnell
and all of his idealism,

28:08.108 --> 28:10.010
is suggesting
that we do our jobs

28:10.043 --> 28:12.679
as well as his,

28:12.713 --> 28:14.447
well,

28:14.480 --> 28:16.950
there's burden

28:16.983 --> 28:19.319
and then there's burden.

28:26.893 --> 28:28.028
DOLE: The thing about Lander,

28:28.061 --> 28:29.162
he's a fair judge,

28:29.195 --> 28:30.564
smart,

28:30.597 --> 28:32.198
but he's extremely active.

28:32.866 --> 28:33.834
Okay.

28:33.867 --> 28:35.301
His docket
is also pretty congested,

28:35.335 --> 28:37.504
which means you can expect
some intolerance.

28:37.538 --> 28:38.238
Why?

28:38.271 --> 28:40.340
You're suing a town

28:40.373 --> 28:42.709
for having a soccer program.

28:42.743 --> 28:43.844
Also,

28:43.877 --> 28:45.879
he has a bit of a reputation

28:45.912 --> 28:47.147
for beating up on the weak,

28:47.180 --> 28:48.414
and...

28:48.448 --> 28:50.216
he doesn't much like women.

28:50.717 --> 28:51.818
Great.

28:51.852 --> 28:53.587
You need to stand
your ground, Claire.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.156
Right. Okay.

28:59.693 --> 29:01.134
Would you like me
to do this?

29:01.902 --> 29:02.969
Why do you ask that?

29:03.003 --> 29:04.571
Well, you...

29:05.105 --> 29:06.607
you seem uneasy.

29:09.209 --> 29:10.410
Claire,

29:13.647 --> 29:15.348
please, please,
don't be offended

29:15.381 --> 29:16.783
by what I'm about to say.

29:18.318 --> 29:20.921
Some lawyers
though very capable,

29:20.954 --> 29:22.823
extremely intelligent

29:22.856 --> 29:25.592
aren't quite equipped
to be trial attorneys.

29:25.626 --> 29:27.828
It takes a certain stomach.

29:29.730 --> 29:32.799
I'm not saying
that you lack the stomach.

29:32.833 --> 29:34.535
I'm just saying that, uh,

29:34.568 --> 29:35.769
that it's no great shame--

29:35.802 --> 29:37.971
I feel quite strongly
I'm equipped.

29:39.873 --> 29:41.174
Okay.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.579
If, uh, if you need
any more help,

29:45.612 --> 29:47.781
just, uh, just call me, okay?

29:48.248 --> 29:49.516
Uh-hmm.

29:50.917 --> 29:51.718
DOLE: I'll see you in there.

29:51.752 --> 29:52.686
Okay.

29:52.719 --> 29:55.656
(music playing)

30:16.316 --> 30:17.217
No word?

30:20.253 --> 30:21.622
Not yet.

30:24.124 --> 30:26.159
They haven't been out
too long, really.

30:28.094 --> 30:28.895
(clears throat)

30:34.568 --> 30:35.536
You've been beating yourself up

30:35.569 --> 30:36.670
pretty good over this one.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.040
I think it should be a law.

30:40.073 --> 30:42.609
For any crime
where the defendant faces prison

30:42.643 --> 30:44.878
for ten years or more,

30:44.911 --> 30:46.580
the attorney should be required

30:46.613 --> 30:48.214
to have at least five years

30:48.248 --> 30:49.382
of experience.

30:49.783 --> 30:52.052
Problem is,

30:52.085 --> 30:54.921
most lawyers, once they get
that much experience,

30:54.955 --> 30:56.289
tend to have paying clients.

30:57.257 --> 30:58.725
And the last thing they want

30:58.759 --> 31:00.534
are criminal cases.

31:00.567 --> 31:04.004
That's what makes
our work so noble,

31:04.037 --> 31:05.038
remember?

31:07.674 --> 31:09.576
Bobby,
you're never gonna believe

31:09.610 --> 31:11.177
who's here to see you.

31:21.955 --> 31:23.189
Could you get me off a jury?

31:23.223 --> 31:24.558
YOUNG: Come on, Lucy.

31:28.795 --> 31:30.997
(sighs) If your therapist
sent you here, I'm not--

31:31.031 --> 31:32.165
That's not it.

31:32.699 --> 31:33.767
Then what is it?

31:35.836 --> 31:37.771
Look,

31:37.804 --> 31:38.805
Bobby,

31:40.541 --> 31:42.609
I'd be lying
if I said I...

31:42.643 --> 31:44.711
didn't enjoy
getting the better of you.

31:44.745 --> 31:45.779
I do.

31:47.213 --> 31:50.150
But what I wanna clear up,
and, uh,

31:50.183 --> 31:51.585
you can dismiss this if you--

31:51.618 --> 31:53.086
Just say it, Ken.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.356
When those DNA results came back

31:56.389 --> 31:59.059
clearing your guy,

31:59.092 --> 32:01.134
it was devastating

32:01.167 --> 32:03.303
not because I lost a conviction,

32:04.404 --> 32:06.239
but because...

32:06.272 --> 32:07.808
to think I played a part

32:07.841 --> 32:09.743
in someone doing time.

32:10.811 --> 32:12.846
No prosecutor sits well with it.

32:14.615 --> 32:17.050
And I bet...

32:17.083 --> 32:19.520
though it was news
you were hoping to get

32:22.155 --> 32:23.957
on some level,

32:23.990 --> 32:27.160
it was devastating for you, too.

32:30.531 --> 32:31.998
That it?

32:37.203 --> 32:38.972
Oh, piss off, then.

32:42.643 --> 32:43.944
(door slams)

32:48.882 --> 32:50.617
Imagine the floodgate

32:50.651 --> 32:51.818
of litigation.

32:52.418 --> 32:54.287
First, we're suing
over soccer injuries.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.389
Tomorrow, football players
will be lining up.

32:56.422 --> 32:58.224
After that, hockey,

32:58.258 --> 32:59.693
wrestling,

32:59.726 --> 33:01.001
come on.

33:01.034 --> 33:02.936
Kids sometimes get hurt

33:02.969 --> 33:04.037
playing sports.

33:04.070 --> 33:06.840
It's a fact.
It's common sense.

33:06.873 --> 33:08.108
It's also common sense

33:08.141 --> 33:10.511
that a town can't have parents

33:10.544 --> 33:12.278
suing them every time
there's an accident.

33:12.879 --> 33:14.648
I would add to that,
Your Honor,

33:14.681 --> 33:17.684
that the plaintiff
signed a waiver,

33:17.718 --> 33:20.220
waiving any
and all negligence lawsuits

33:20.253 --> 33:22.222
based upon injuries
from soccer.

33:22.255 --> 33:24.057
In short and accordingly,

33:24.090 --> 33:25.726
this action
should be dismissed immediately

33:25.759 --> 33:26.727
as a matter of law,

33:26.760 --> 33:28.862
also as a matter
of simple practicality,

33:28.895 --> 33:32.633
because this is just
plain silly.

33:35.401 --> 33:36.903
LANDER: Ms. Wyatt?

33:44.377 --> 33:45.879
Ms. Wyatt,

33:45.912 --> 33:47.748
do you have a response?

33:51.752 --> 33:52.919
You okay?

33:54.120 --> 33:55.288
(clears throat)

34:00.026 --> 34:02.002
Your Honor,

34:02.035 --> 34:03.870
Timothy Boyd is a young boy

34:03.904 --> 34:06.439
who chose to play soccer
in a program that--

34:06.472 --> 34:08.641
The town is full of young boys
playing soccer, counsel.

34:08.675 --> 34:11.244
They break legs,
bump heads, get concussions.

34:11.277 --> 34:13.112
It's a contact sport,
for God's sake.

34:13.146 --> 34:14.848
That's why they sign waivers.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.248
Yes, but we're not talking about

34:16.282 --> 34:18.985
a hazardous game
where accidents can happen.

34:19.018 --> 34:20.786
We're alleging
that the game itself

34:20.821 --> 34:22.556
is inherently unsafe,

34:22.589 --> 34:25.058
that even when played correctly
without mishap,

34:25.091 --> 34:27.293
it can still result
in neurological injuries,

34:27.327 --> 34:28.929
as it did with Timothy Boyd.

34:28.962 --> 34:30.897
Come on, counsel,
I got precedents staring me

34:30.931 --> 34:32.165
right in the face here.

34:32.197 --> 34:34.034
You can't hold a city liable

34:34.067 --> 34:35.636
for injuries in a soccer game.

34:35.668 --> 34:36.803
Did you read these cases?

34:36.837 --> 34:38.972
I read them, Your Honor.

34:39.005 --> 34:41.341
And I don't interpret them
to bar the type of lawsuit

34:41.373 --> 34:42.543
that we're bringing.

34:42.576 --> 34:44.244
You wouldn't.

34:45.545 --> 34:46.847
You'll agree soccer

34:46.880 --> 34:49.349
would be a hazardous
recreational activity

34:49.382 --> 34:50.751
under the case law,
wouldn't you?

34:58.158 --> 35:00.601
Wouldn't you Ms. Wyatt?

35:04.771 --> 35:06.239
WYATT: I'm sorry.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.609
LANDER: Let me read
some of the language for you,

35:08.642 --> 35:09.309
counsel.

35:10.844 --> 35:12.713
"Soccer, unquestionably,

35:12.746 --> 35:15.682
is a hazardous activity,
within the meaning of--"

35:15.716 --> 35:17.117
WYATT: But the hazard
they're talking about

35:17.150 --> 35:18.519
relates to body contact.

35:19.319 --> 35:20.453
So what?

35:20.486 --> 35:21.955
WYATT: Look, we all know

35:21.988 --> 35:24.057
when kids play football,

35:24.090 --> 35:25.692
or basketball, or hockey,

35:25.726 --> 35:26.827
bones get broken.

35:26.860 --> 35:29.062
We can't have parents
running into court

35:29.095 --> 35:30.964
to sue every time
something like that happens.

35:30.997 --> 35:32.633
I totally agree.

35:32.666 --> 35:34.801
But this case isn't that.

35:35.435 --> 35:37.370
Soccer calls for heading.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.405
It encourages, promotes,

35:39.439 --> 35:41.174
and demands the very activity

35:41.207 --> 35:42.776
that's doing the damage.

35:42.809 --> 35:43.944
That makes this case different

35:43.977 --> 35:47.047
from anything anticipated
by the case law

35:47.080 --> 35:49.349
or the Massachusetts Claims
Torts Act.

35:49.382 --> 35:51.051
But even if you're right,

35:51.084 --> 35:52.786
counsel,

35:52.819 --> 35:54.788
you have assumption
of the risk problems.

35:54.821 --> 35:56.056
Certainly,
your client knew

35:56.089 --> 35:57.223
that heading
was part of the game.

35:57.924 --> 35:59.693
But he didn't know
it was dangerous.

36:00.166 --> 36:01.735
The defendant didn't even know.

36:01.768 --> 36:04.204
How do you know
what the defendant knew?

36:04.237 --> 36:05.939
Well, I'm assuming
had they known the risks,

36:05.972 --> 36:07.340
they would've mandated helmets.

36:08.008 --> 36:11.377
Well, if they weren't aware
of the risk,

36:11.411 --> 36:12.779
then how can they be negligent

36:12.813 --> 36:14.915
for failing
to safeguard against it?

36:19.485 --> 36:21.688
Did you hear
my question, counsel?

36:21.722 --> 36:23.289
I heard it.

36:26.827 --> 36:28.962
The essence
of our negligence claim

36:28.995 --> 36:30.664
is that the city failed

36:30.697 --> 36:33.366
to properly ascertain
the degree of danger.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.401
Along with every municipality
in the country,

36:35.435 --> 36:37.704
then for that matter,
the world.

36:38.338 --> 36:40.273
That may be true,

36:40.306 --> 36:41.875
but lawsuits,
especially ones

36:41.908 --> 36:43.644
based on theories of negligence,

36:43.677 --> 36:46.046
are primarily
about allocating burden.

36:46.079 --> 36:49.049
Who's better able to bear the
burden of fixing the problem?

36:49.082 --> 36:50.884
That's the questions courts ask.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.252
Well, here, I ask you,

36:52.953 --> 36:54.521
who's in a better position
to detect

36:54.555 --> 36:56.757
whether soccer's
an inherently unsafe sport,

36:56.790 --> 36:58.358
a municipality

36:58.391 --> 37:00.060
or an eight year-old boy?

37:00.093 --> 37:02.201
Fine. Then under your logic,

37:02.235 --> 37:03.603
if it were suddenly determined

37:03.637 --> 37:07.340
that running causes cancer,

37:07.373 --> 37:10.510
you could sue city
field-and-track programs

37:10.544 --> 37:12.779
because the city
is in a better position

37:12.812 --> 37:13.980
to make the discovery.

37:14.013 --> 37:16.916
No, that's not the same.
Why not?

37:16.950 --> 37:19.419
Because the idea
that running causes cancer,

37:19.452 --> 37:21.622
that's wildly unforeseeable.

37:21.655 --> 37:23.524
The notion that kids
heading soccer balls

37:23.557 --> 37:25.559
can cause brain damage is not,

37:25.592 --> 37:27.160
especially since we all know

37:27.193 --> 37:29.062
that young brains
are not fully matured,

37:29.095 --> 37:31.598
especially since doctors
have been saying it,

37:31.632 --> 37:33.934
especially since there are
studies documenting it.

37:34.601 --> 37:36.169
And since
it's a question of fact,

37:36.202 --> 37:37.971
I would also--
All right, I've heard enough.

37:38.004 --> 37:39.339
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

37:39.372 --> 37:40.373
I'm not quite finished.

37:40.406 --> 37:41.875
I said...

37:42.676 --> 37:44.344
I've heard enough, counsel.

37:51.585 --> 37:53.386
Defendant's motion to dismiss

37:53.419 --> 37:54.988
is denied.

37:55.021 --> 37:57.257
The trial date will be set
the first week in March.

37:57.958 --> 37:58.825
Adjourned.

37:59.292 --> 38:00.133
(gavel bangs)

38:08.374 --> 38:10.944
He really said that, right?
We won the motion?

38:10.977 --> 38:12.478
How many times
are you gonna ask me?

38:12.513 --> 38:14.280
Well, I just keep thinking
it's a mistake

38:14.314 --> 38:16.349
or some practical joke.

38:17.984 --> 38:20.521
I actually beat John Wicker

38:20.554 --> 38:22.656
in a summary-judgment hearing.

38:22.689 --> 38:23.957
Thank you, Lindsay.

38:23.990 --> 38:25.291
Hey, you did it.

38:25.325 --> 38:26.727
I just sat there.

38:27.293 --> 38:30.096
But your being there
by my side

38:30.130 --> 38:32.298
gave me some credibility,
I know.

38:32.332 --> 38:34.134
Hopefully,
now I'll be able to settle.

38:34.167 --> 38:36.402
Listen, I know I said
you could stay here

38:36.436 --> 38:38.471
a full three weeks,

38:38.505 --> 38:40.206
but I'd like to go back
on my word a little

38:41.608 --> 38:43.343
and offer you a full-time job.

38:44.678 --> 38:45.679
What?

38:46.412 --> 38:48.782
I'd also like to retract
my doubt over you

38:48.815 --> 38:50.050
being a trial lawyer.

38:52.553 --> 38:54.555
You're offering me a job?

38:54.588 --> 38:56.322
You're equipped, Claire.

38:58.024 --> 39:00.133
You belong in that room.

39:09.475 --> 39:10.376
KIRKLAND: Mr. Foreman,

39:10.410 --> 39:12.045
has the jury reached a verdict?

39:12.078 --> 39:13.213
We have, Your Honor.

39:13.246 --> 39:14.948
In the matter of Lewis Nyler

39:14.981 --> 39:17.383
versus the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, et al,

39:17.417 --> 39:18.084
how find you?

39:19.019 --> 39:21.487
As to the claim
of wrongful imprisonment,

39:21.522 --> 39:23.089
we the jury find

39:23.123 --> 39:24.124
for the plaintiff,

39:24.157 --> 39:25.626
Lewis Nyler.

39:26.259 --> 39:28.629
As to compensatory damages,

39:28.662 --> 39:31.364
we order the defendants
to pay Lewis Nyler

39:31.397 --> 39:32.933
$400,000.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.469
As to punitive damages
based on intentional

39:36.503 --> 39:38.939
or reckless false imprisonment,

39:38.972 --> 39:41.908
we order the defendants
to pay Lewis Nyler

39:41.942 --> 39:42.776
nothing.

39:43.710 --> 39:44.745
KIRKLAND: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

39:44.778 --> 39:47.147
the court thanks you
for your service.

39:47.180 --> 39:48.148
You are dismissed.

39:48.181 --> 39:49.850
We are adjourned.

39:49.883 --> 39:50.817
(gavel bangs)

39:53.687 --> 39:55.121
Congratulations.

39:55.656 --> 39:57.591
It didn't exactly
send a message, but--

39:57.624 --> 39:59.025
It was something.

40:00.734 --> 40:01.902
Yeah.

40:05.271 --> 40:07.508
Listen, Lewis, uh,

40:07.541 --> 40:08.775
it needs to be said.

40:08.809 --> 40:10.443
No,

40:10.476 --> 40:12.145
it doesn't, Bobby.

40:14.447 --> 40:15.782
May I ask...

40:17.651 --> 40:19.553
why'd you even want me
for this trial?

40:21.054 --> 40:22.388
It's not as if--

40:24.891 --> 40:26.860
Project Innocence got you out.

40:26.893 --> 40:28.294
I was the one...

40:33.499 --> 40:35.235
why?

40:35.268 --> 40:37.303
I knew you'd be motivated.

40:42.442 --> 40:43.777
I'm sorry, Lewis.

40:47.147 --> 40:48.915
I wish I could give you back
those years.

40:49.883 --> 40:51.685
Yeah.

40:51.718 --> 40:53.754
Thank you, Bobby.

40:59.693 --> 41:02.636
(music playing)

41:08.208 --> 41:10.343
WYATT: I'll just be a couple
of minutes. Thank you.

41:10.376 --> 41:11.912
MAN: No problem.

41:52.753 --> 41:55.689
(music playing)

42:28.729 --> 42:30.130
WOMAN: Next on "The Practice."

42:30.163 --> 42:32.699
And you're telling me I could
actually go away for life,

42:32.733 --> 42:35.101
simply because I happened
to look like somebody?

42:35.135 --> 42:37.538
BERLUTI: Like somebody
who stabbed three women.

42:37.571 --> 42:39.840
Get them to flash his rage,
push him.

42:39.873 --> 42:42.142
Why?
Because you're the prototype

42:42.175 --> 42:43.409
of the women he kills.

42:44.310 --> 42:46.112
You speak as a defeatist.

42:46.146 --> 42:48.048
I speak as a realist.

42:48.081 --> 42:49.683
The public
wants to lynch somebody.

42:49.716 --> 42:52.418
Right now, your son
is the only offering.

42:55.756 --> 42:58.692
(music playing)

43:21.955 --> 43:23.189
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:23.223 --> 43:26.192
(music playing)
