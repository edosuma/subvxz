11:29.754 --> 11:32.657
All right, boys and girls, listen up! Mom's
on a walking tour of Danville, and Dad's

11:32.659 --> 11:36.761
tinkering in the basement, so I'm in charge.
That means no shenanigans.

11:36.763 --> 11:41.266
Hey, Spider-Man. So I'll be over
at Stacy's all d-d-d-d-day.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.134
Sup?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.903
Greetings,
fair young maiden.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.872
(SQUEAKING ) It's
superheroes in our kitchen!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.808
Candace is gonna go
lie down for a while.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.430
Heroes.
That's it, just breathe.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.950
(SQUEAKING) Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, in our kitchen...
ISABELLA: They're only superheroes.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.748
Looks like you guys
have a fan.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.283
Oh, boy.
(CAT YOWLS)

11:58.285 --> 12:00.185
Then it's probably good
she didn't see that.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.719
IRON MAN: I'm okay.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.121
Hey, where's Perry?

12:03.123 --> 12:05.290
MAJOR MONOGRAM:
<i>Have a seat, Agent P.</i>

12:05.292 --> 12:08.193
<i>Due to the gravity of your mission
today, the gentleman on the big screen</i>

12:08.195 --> 12:12.664
<i>will be addressing you while I use
this old TV monitor Carl found</i>

12:12.666 --> 12:16.134
<i>in the basement. CARL: Sorry, sir. I
couldn't get the split screen to work.</i>

12:16.136 --> 12:21.005
<i>Anyway, this is Director
Nick Fury of S-H-I-E-L-D.</i>

12:21.007 --> 12:23.007
<i>That's SHIELD.</i>
<i>It's an acronym.</i>

12:23.009 --> 12:24.943
<i>Oh, like OWCA.</i>

12:24.945 --> 12:28.813
<i>Yes, except it's cool. Now,
where is your agent, Major?</i>

12:28.815 --> 12:30.115
<i>He's sitting right there.</i>

12:30.117 --> 12:31.649
<i>You mean, behind the platypus?</i>

12:31.651 --> 12:35.286
<i>No, that's secret agent</i>
<i>Perry the Platypus.</i>

12:35.288 --> 12:38.690
<i>Is he some kind of super platypus
with super platypus powers?</i>

12:38.692 --> 12:40.692
<i>Uh, no.</i>

12:40.694 --> 12:42.855
<i>Does he have some kind of
robotic platypus exoskeleton?</i>

12:43.696 --> 12:46.264
<i>He, uh... He has a fedora.</i>

12:46.266 --> 12:49.200
<i>Hey, wait a minute. Were you wearing
that eye patch when we started?</i>

12:49.202 --> 12:52.704
<i>Oh, this? Yeah, it's, uh, doctor's orders.
Uh, I have a sty.</i>

12:52.706 --> 12:54.139
CARL: <i>He thinks it makes</i>
<i>him look cool!</i>

12:54.141 --> 12:54.876
<i>No, I don't!</i>

12:54.941 --> 12:58.643
<i>I'm going to proceed as if
this were going really well.</i>

12:58.645 --> 13:02.113
<i>Agent P, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and
Spider-Man have lost their super powers</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:04.182
<i>due to a mysterious power</i>
<i>siphoning ray,</i>

13:04.184 --> 13:06.751
<i>which we believe originated
somewhere in the Danville area.</i>

13:06.753 --> 13:09.687
<i>We fear a group of
super-villains are closing in.</i>

13:09.689 --> 13:12.090
<i>We need you to monitor</i>
<i>the situation and report back.</i>

13:12.092 --> 13:15.293
<i>Francis, I'm gonna need you...</i>
<i>Now what are you doing?</i>

13:15.295 --> 13:18.096
CARL: <i>He thinks two eye patches
makes him look twice as cool.</i>

13:18.098 --> 13:19.864
<i>I don't know what you're</i>
<i>talking about.</i>

13:19.866 --> 13:22.800
(GROANS)

13:22.802 --> 13:26.004
Welcome to my hall of inators.
Ah, here's a good one.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.073
This, this was my
Oatmeal-To-Porridge-inator.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.409
I know, it's a fine distinction,
don't get me started.

13:31.411 --> 13:35.780
And here's my Multi-Helio-
Tactical-Baboon-Glom-inator.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.749
I think that one
is self-explanatory.

13:37.751 --> 13:41.819
Here's my Waffle-inator,
and the Junk-Mail-inator...

13:41.821 --> 13:45.757
I do not understand. These machines are useless.
What is wrong with this man?

13:45.759 --> 13:48.026
Maybe he is
a misunderstood genius.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.196
Or maybe he is a perfectly
understood idiot.

13:51.198 --> 13:55.767
And finally, my Disintegrator-inator!
Pretty impressive, huh?

13:55.769 --> 13:58.803
Where is the machine zat took
away the powers of the heroes?

13:58.805 --> 14:02.273
Oh, my Power-Drain-inator!
Ooh, that was a cool one.

14:02.275 --> 14:06.311
And it was destroyed by my nemesis, Perry
the Platypus. You just missed him.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.447
Perry the Platypus? Is he
a super soldier platypus?

14:09.449 --> 14:12.483
No. Was he bitten by a
radioactive platypus?

14:12.485 --> 14:15.420
No, he's, uh, just a regular,
crime-fighting platypus.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.323
It is no matter! You will
rebuild the machine!

14:18.325 --> 14:21.159
Oh, so we're working
together now! Great!

14:21.161 --> 14:24.262
I'll be the leader. I've always
wanted an evil entourage.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.830
Let's destroy him.

14:25.832 --> 14:28.199
<i>Nein.</i> Let him think
he is in charge.

14:28.201 --> 14:33.037
When he has exceeded his usefulness,
we will give him to Modok to destroy.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.139
Hey, where is Modok?

14:35.141 --> 14:38.476
Curse you, Danville, town
of small doors!

14:38.478 --> 14:41.479
Listen, before I rebuild the machine,
I've got some errands to run.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.881
You guys should come with.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.852
Is your head gonna burst into flames,
or am I thinking of somebody else?

14:47.854 --> 14:51.055
Ladies and gentlemen, and
Hulk, allow me to unveil our

14:51.057 --> 14:54.859
Secret Hideout for Emergency
Defense, or "SHED" for short.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.961
I think we're gonna need
something a little bigger.

14:56.963 --> 15:01.266
Oh, the rustic exterior is a facade.
Wait till you see the inside!

15:01.268 --> 15:04.869
IRON MAN: Oh, man!
You guys are good.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.938
Just a little British
sci-fi technology.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.874
Iron Man, looks like someone
raided your armory.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.977
Oh, you like that, huh? This
is the Beak suit, mark two.

15:12.979 --> 15:16.014
We're still working on the waterproofing,
so we can't take it out in the rain.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.950
You know, Stark Industries
offers summer internships.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.286
Thanks, but this summer
is pretty packed.

15:21.288 --> 15:21.961
Apparently.

15:21.988 --> 15:26.858
And these are your SHED key card IDs. They'll
get you into all areas of the compound.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.192
Ooh! And they're laminated.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.528
Um... Hi.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.563
Would you guys read
my fan fiction?

15:32.565 --> 15:34.845
It's a story where Thor and Hulk
decide to learn ice-skating...

15:34.865 --> 15:37.001
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to accept unsolicited material.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.070
Candace, I didn't know
you were a fangirl.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.073
Oh, sure, from way back. It started
'cause I had to do a lot of research to

15:42.075 --> 15:45.176
get up to speed for the Ducky
Momo-Superhero crossover event.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.012
Quack-quack! Ducky
Momo-<i>san, superhero -desu!</i>

15:48.014 --> 15:50.581
Okay, superheroes, we have to
get to work building a device

15:50.583 --> 15:52.417
that will restore your powers!

15:52.419 --> 15:54.085
Ferb, I know what we're
gonna do today.

Until we find out what happened

this machine should be able
to replicate them temporarily.

Everyone in position,
and we'll start calibration.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.105
Let's get our hero on!

17:21.107 --> 17:23.074
Just a minute, Candace.
We all set?

17:23.076 --> 17:24.342
All set. Just as soon as I...

17:24.344 --> 17:26.043
Great! All set!
(SIREN GOES OFF)

17:26.045 --> 17:27.612
Lock down the power assignments
and reverse polarity.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.980
Candace,
what did you do?

17:28.982 --> 17:30.148
Uh-oh.

17:36.288 --> 17:37.655
Are you guys okay?

17:37.657 --> 17:40.358
By Odin's beard,
I feel invigorated!

17:40.926 --> 17:42.460
See? It worked. Hmm?

17:42.462 --> 17:44.262
Well, not exactly. Look!

17:46.131 --> 17:47.331
Something is not right.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.602
Whew! Oh, boy!
That was great!

17:51.604 --> 17:54.572
Hey, I've got an idea! Let's go get
some ice cream and spoil our dinner.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.507
I mean, who's gonna
tell us no, huh?

17:56.509 --> 17:58.976
That's it! I've had it!
We are wasting our time!

17:58.978 --> 18:01.546
We need to bring
the heroes to us!

18:03.582 --> 18:05.016
Well!

18:05.018 --> 18:07.084
Something's gone terribly
wrong, Candace.

18:07.086 --> 18:11.022
You've swapped all their powers.
Obviously, Thor's got Spider-Man's powers!

18:11.024 --> 18:12.590
Spider-Man got Hulk's powers.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.551
Yeah, I could get
used to this.

18:14.592 --> 18:16.627
I... I have a fear of heights.
Could you please put us down?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.429
Iron Man must have
Thor's powers.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.131
Well, at least
he can move now.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.533
Everyone has new super
powers, except Hulk.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.170
He must have Iron Man's powers, but
without the suit, there's not much there.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.172
I am feeling
entrepreneurial.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.308
At least his
vocabulary's improved.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.743
So give me the hammer. What do I do?
Just stick out my hand, right?

18:32.745 --> 18:34.545
Come on, baby,
come to papa.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.047
That's not
how it works.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.582
What do you mean?
I've got your powers.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.551
Wielding Mjolnir is about
worthiness, not power.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.286
Really?
It's a fine distinction,

18:42.288 --> 18:43.621
but an important one.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.689
Potayto, potahto.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.459
I do not know
what that means.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.561
Okay, never mind. What about the lightning?
How do I control that?

18:50.563 --> 18:53.030
Actually, that only works
with the hammer.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.699
What about flying?
I've seen you fly.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.667
Well, yes. But not
without the hammer.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.469
Not without the hammer.
Right.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.238
This is a disaster,
Candace.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.139
Look, it was an accident,

19:02.141 --> 19:03.407
but I can still help. I know
that the villains will...

19:03.409 --> 19:05.072
No! You don't know!

19:05.109 --> 19:08.412
The entire Tri-State Area, and
possibly the world, is at stake here.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.281
Honestly, Candace, if you
don't know what you're doing,

19:10.283 --> 19:11.782
keep your hands
off the machinery!

19:11.784 --> 19:13.551
Well, then, maybe
I should just leave.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.319
Yeah, maybe you should.

19:18.590 --> 19:21.559
MALE NEWSCASTER: <i>Alert! Alert!

<i>and a giant chicken egg with a face, are

19:38.111 --> 19:38.968
We are needed.

19:39.011 --> 19:43.414
But you can't! Your powers, they're not fixed yet.
We just need more time.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.584
I know, Phineas. But we're
heroes. This is what we do.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.686
Wait! Can we help?

19:48.688 --> 19:49.754
Not unless you can fly.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.292
Well, it's not raining.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.763
Whoo-hoo!

20:00.666 --> 20:02.199
(SCREAMING)

20:06.438 --> 20:08.306
This should get
their attention.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.476
SPIDER-MAN: Looks like
somebody left the door open!

20:12.478 --> 20:15.346
All right, gang, it's show time!
Everybody ready?

20:15.348 --> 20:18.249
I feel pretty good! I'd feel
better with a metal suit.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.650
Sorry, big guy. No time.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.619
Look!

20:21.621 --> 20:24.555
Ah, the superheroes are here to save the day.
But without your powers,

20:24.557 --> 20:27.725
this is just a costume party.
Modok, destroy them!

20:27.727 --> 20:32.830
Yes, I will take great pleasure
in destroying these puny heroes.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.800
I got him, guys.
Spider-Man smash!

20:39.605 --> 20:41.339
Whoa!

20:41.341 --> 20:42.573
Was he making fun of me?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.708
A little, yes.

20:50.248 --> 20:51.882

have their powers!

20:51.884 --> 20:54.819
Yes, but they are all mixed
up. Is this your doing?

20:54.821 --> 20:57.421
I don't remember making
a Power-Switch-inator,

20:57.423 --> 20:59.757
but you know, I make
a lot of inators, so... Aah!

21:01.893 --> 21:05.329
You know, it'd really be nice right now
to have the power to throw a hammer.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.265
I told you, it's not about
power, it's about worthiness.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.234
It's like talking
to a Bilgesnipe.

21:13.639 --> 21:14.705
(CAWS)

21:17.676 --> 21:18.743
Hey, what's going on...

21:20.612 --> 21:23.781
Get off my... I find myself
in a sticky situation.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.717
Oh, no, I've received
Spider-Man's propensity for puns.

21:36.728 --> 21:39.363
Now I wish we'd prioritized
the waterproofing.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.677
Now I'm Iron Man!

21:48.607 --> 21:53.210
Okay, that time I overshot the mark.
Oh, hey, Venom, what'd I miss?

21:54.613 --> 21:56.144
Spider-Man, are you okay?

21:56.214 --> 21:58.916
Could be worse. At least
Iron Man and Thor are...

21:59.351 --> 22:00.851
Well, at least Iron Man...

22:00.853 --> 22:02.620
Sorry, gang. A little
tied up at the moment.

22:02.622 --> 22:08.759
Okay, never mind.
It couldn't be worse.

22:08.761 --> 22:13.664
STAN LEE: <i>Welcome back, faithful viewers.
When last we left our handsome heroes,</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:17.668
<i>their fate hung in the balance</i>
<i>in a cataclysmic cliffhanger.</i>

22:17.670 --> 22:20.705
This was all too easy.

22:20.707 --> 22:27.745
The time for heroes is over. Now all will
bow to us, for nothing will save you now!

22:27.747 --> 22:28.813
(WHOOSHING)

22:38.824 --> 22:39.924
Stop him!

22:46.732 --> 22:49.600
Hey, duck guy, thanks for the rescue.
Do we tip him?

22:49.602 --> 22:51.268
He's not parking our car.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.369
I just don't know
the etiquette.

22:52.371 --> 22:56.407
Who was that masked
beaver duck?

22:56.409 --> 22:59.410
Modok will exterminate
all beaver ducks!

22:59.412 --> 23:02.413
You know, none of this would've happened
if we had just gone for ice cream

23:02.415 --> 23:03.681
like I suggested.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.685
Thank you,
small but mighty friend.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.720
You know,
he seemed vaguely familiar.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.622
You think that was
Howard the Duck?

23:11.624 --> 23:14.892
Time is of the essence. We've got...
No, it wasn't Howard the Duck!

23:14.894 --> 23:15.993
What? I'm just sayin'.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.158
He did have a bill.

23:17.195 --> 23:19.964
Anyway, we need to regroup
and figure out a plan B.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.299
Right. Back to SHED-quarters!

23:22.301 --> 23:23.367
Hi, guys.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.568
So, how'd it go?

23:24.570 --> 23:26.470
IRON MAN: We got
our butts handed to us.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.873
How was Venom able to overpower you
when you have Hulk's strength?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.908
I don't know, I'm...
I'm not feeling it anymore.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.309
Wait, let me try something.

23:34.679 --> 23:35.659
I did not stick.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.749
I was afraid of that. The powers are
not bonding with your cell structures.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.885
Yes, my suit is getting
heavier again.

23:40.887 --> 23:44.455
But at least having Thor's strength
unlocked the joints, so I can move.

23:44.457 --> 23:47.691
Perhaps we can give you a recharge, but of
course, this time with the correct powers.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.760
We have been working
on rebuilding the machine.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.428
And I'm helping!

23:51.430 --> 23:53.531
You are?
I'm redeeming myself!

23:53.533 --> 23:55.800
Yes, and we are almost done
with the first component.

23:55.802 --> 23:59.637
Hulk's gamma ray concentration beam.
Brawn first, right, big guy?

24:00.839 --> 24:01.635
That's great!

24:01.640 --> 24:04.542
So, have you done a base level
particle acceleration yet?

24:04.544 --> 24:05.943
BALJEET:
I was just about to.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.545
IRON MAN: It's really
important to make sure you...

24:07.547 --> 24:09.384
Wait. Let me get this for you.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.615
PHINEAS: Oh, sure. Otherwise, the
gamma ray inverters... Whoa!

24:11.617 --> 24:12.750
Uh, who plugged...

24:12.752 --> 24:13.851
Uh-oh.

24:13.853 --> 24:14.919
(SCREAMING)

24:18.557 --> 24:20.424
Baljeet smash!

24:25.096 --> 24:28.365
Wow. There's something
you don't see every... What?

24:28.367 --> 24:30.734
Really, Candace? Do you have
any idea what you just did?

24:30.736 --> 24:32.336
I was just trying to help.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.572
Well, your help this morning
messed us up so badly,

24:34.574 --> 24:36.707
we came this close to being
wiped out at the mall.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.875
I thought you would've
learned your lesson.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.810
But... But I...

24:39.812 --> 24:42.813
But no. You show up again to help,
and now Baljeet has been Hulkified

24:42.815 --> 24:44.897
And is rampaging
who knows where.

24:44.915 --> 24:47.017
And we're back to square one with
restoring the heroes' powers.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.919
But...
This is just too important...

24:48.921 --> 24:50.988
And we can't afford any more
setbacks!

24:50.990 --> 24:54.658
I'm revoking your SHED card.
You have to go. Now.

25:00.699 --> 25:03.534
I've always told her,
don't ever make Phineas angry.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.002
You wouldn't like it
when he's angry.

25:12.410 --> 25:14.745
Oh, no! Baljeet!
We've gotta go after him!

25:14.747 --> 25:18.082
Sadly, there is no time.
Our mission lies elsewhere.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.921
Well, I'll go after him, then.

25:19.984 --> 25:23.020
No, no. I'll go. You stay here, little girl.
It might get ugly.

25:23.022 --> 25:26.924
What, you don't think I can handle ugly?
I've been hanging out with you all summer.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.726
Sticks and stones.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.666
(BEEPING) NICK FURY:
<i>Greetings, Agent P.</i>

25:32.696 --> 25:36.433
<i>SHIELD has gotten intel that the super
villains are holed up in downtown Danville</i>

25:36.435 --> 25:38.602
<i>in an oddly shaped building</i>
<i>with its own jingle.</i>

25:38.604 --> 25:40.971
<i>We need you to find</i>
<i>out what they're up to.</i>

25:40.973 --> 25:43.107
<i>And neutralize them</i>
<i>if possible, Agent P.</i>

25:43.109 --> 25:45.809
<i>Monogram! Seriously?</i>
<i>The beard, too?</i>

25:45.811 --> 25:48.879
<i>You're not the only one who can
rock an awesome face mullet, Fury!</i>

25:50.749 --> 25:54.184
And see, it takes four orbs of
mundanium finite to power it,

25:54.186 --> 25:58.622
and it would only take one orb of pizzazzium
infinionite, but that's so hard to find.

25:58.624 --> 26:04.595
Oh, don't get me started. So, we just
lock the module in here and viola!

26:04.597 --> 26:07.698
Yeah, I know, it's a large violin. I...
I don't know why people say that.

26:07.700 --> 26:11.835
Anyhoo, what did you guys need a
second Power Drain-inator for?

26:11.837 --> 26:16.473
So we won't have to deal
with your idiocy anymore!

26:16.475 --> 26:19.576
Wait, that's not nice! I thought we were buds!
We were amigos!

26:19.578 --> 26:21.512
We had... We had a song
and everything!

26:21.514 --> 26:25.549
Your little musical interlude was
a pleasant diversion at best.

26:25.551 --> 26:29.219
You see, we're not going to
take over the Tri-State Area.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.989
We are going to completely
destroy it

26:31.991 --> 26:34.825
to show what will happen if anyone
attempts to thwart our plan.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.927
Did you just say,
"'Swart' our plan"?

26:36.929 --> 26:40.998
No. "Thwart." "Thwart"
with a "T-H." "Thwart."

26:41.000 --> 26:44.768
Oh, "Thwart!" Oh, that makes more sense.
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe you should go see

26:44.770 --> 26:48.105
a speech pathologist or
a dialect coach or something.

26:48.107 --> 26:52.876
Silence! Once we have made our point, we
will use our contraption to draw away

26:52.878 --> 26:57.848
ze powers of all ze superheroes on
ze planet and take over ze world!

26:57.850 --> 26:59.984
Wow, you guys
really think big!

26:59.986 --> 27:04.588
But first, Venom, squash
our little fly on ze ceiling.

27:14.833 --> 27:20.738
Now we go and send a little message to
our handicapped heroes. Come! <i>Schnell!</i>

27:20.740 --> 27:23.273
You're not very good
at thwarting.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.744
I... I should hook you up with my nemesis,
Perry the Platypus, for some pointers.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.245
It's an art form for him.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.586
(CAR ALARMS GOING OFF)
Baljeet smash!

27:41.659 --> 27:44.828
TOUR GUIDE: <i>The courtyard also features
a statue of Franz the Elephant.</i>

27:44.830 --> 27:47.031
Hey, Candace. Whatcha doin'?

27:47.033 --> 27:49.700
Just laying here,
utterly dejected.

27:49.702 --> 27:54.772
I hear you. None of the women superheroes
showed up, so it's all about testosterone and

27:54.774 --> 27:58.842
powers and fighting.
Which... Eh.

27:58.844 --> 28:03.781
I was only trying to help, but all I
did was mess things up. I'm useless.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.582
I know exactly how you feel.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.275
Oh, hello, girls. Don't mind me, just
trying to give the lawn a bit of a drink.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.343
It's off now.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.013
Hey, Baljeet.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.114
I'm so happy that
I found you.

29:46.117 --> 29:51.288
I worry about you, you know.
Because you're my best friend.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.893
Thanks, Buford. I did not
like being an angry monster.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.762
I'm glad, because you weren't
very good at it anyway.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.998
Really? I think I was
actually quite terrifying.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.268
Oh, come on. You're totally green.
No pun intended.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.803
For example, when you grab
somebody's shirt to lift them up...

30:06.805 --> 30:10.040
Hey! ...you gotta twist it first.
And then you yell really loud!

30:11.042 --> 30:12.142
(YELLING)

30:12.144 --> 30:14.878
Do not yell at Baljeet
like that!

30:18.917 --> 30:20.851
Okay, the throwing was good.

30:20.853 --> 30:23.353
But when you grabbed
my shirt, you didn't twist!

30:23.355 --> 30:26.323
I swear, it's like in one ear
and right out the other.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.458
Oh, oh, Baljeet, wait up!

30:28.460 --> 30:32.329
Citizens of Danville and the
surrounding Tri-State Area,

30:32.331 --> 30:34.331
prepare for your imminent end.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.902
Unless Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thor
and Hulk show up to face us,

30:38.904 --> 30:43.840
we will unleash a device a thousand
times worse than the one that hit them.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.711
Thanks to Modok's modifications,
our Power Drain-inator

30:47.713 --> 30:49.746
doesn't merely drain power,

30:49.748 --> 30:54.985
it drains energy, matter,
everything the target was. Observe.

30:59.290 --> 31:03.427
Aw, man! And I just moved here from New
York 'cause I thought it would be safer.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.728
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

31:04.730 --> 31:07.464
Uh, guys, you'd better
come see this.

31:07.466 --> 31:11.935
So, heroes, either you come
down here and face us,

31:11.937 --> 31:16.106
or we will unleash this weapon
on the entire Tri-State Area!

31:22.513 --> 31:23.125
The fiend!

31:23.214 --> 31:27.017
I actually missed a lot of that with the accent.
But I got that it's bad.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.519
Oh, man. What are
we gonna do?

31:29.521 --> 31:31.021
What we have to.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.431
But you have no powers!

31:32.523 --> 31:36.360
That doesn't matter. We've gotta fight
back with whatever we've got left.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.896
Being a hero isn't the armor you
wear, but the mettle in your spirit

31:39.898 --> 31:41.335
And the steel in your resolve.

31:41.398 --> 31:45.869
Man, that was eloquent. All I ever do is quips.
Like this one, for instance.

31:45.871 --> 31:47.371
And the one preceding it.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.906
IRON MAN: Can we please not kill
the gravitas of this moment?

31:49.908 --> 31:53.810
SPIDER-MAN: Sorry.

31:53.812 --> 31:57.781
Man! We've got a lot to do if we're
gonna get this suit back online.

31:57.783 --> 32:01.251
I think we can get sixty percent
function back if we reroute the power

32:01.253 --> 32:03.420
flow through
the backup circuits.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.423
Maybe if I just go in and apologize
one more time, they'll forgive me.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.158
I have a stomach ache,
I feel so bad.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.360
They're your brothers,
they'll listen.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.896
Phineas, look, I'm sorry.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.432
How did you get in? I thought
I revoked your SHED ID.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.200
Well, Isabella gave me
her guest pass.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.269
Fine. But don't touch
anything.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.447
Ferb, you gotta listen to me!

32:20.471 --> 32:23.473
The shoulder joint's ready.
Excuse me, Candace.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.175
Phineas, can't you stop
and listen?

32:25.177 --> 32:28.111
Candace, you don't understand!
The guys are in trouble.

32:28.113 --> 32:31.481
If we can't get downtown to help them,
this may be their final battle.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.955
WHIPLASH:
The heroes are not coming.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.958
Oh, don't worry,
they'll come.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.029
My sensors tell me
the heroes are approaching.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.368
Perfect! Surround ze bus!

32:57.842 --> 33:00.444
Out of my way, you weirdoes!
It's worse than Portland.

33:06.951 --> 33:09.453
A mindball?
Really?

33:09.455 --> 33:12.389
Hey, Modok, can you feel it in
your brain when I go like this?
