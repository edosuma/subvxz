00:07.474 --> 00:10.844

-Always.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.636
I need your help.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.972
Whatever Androvax has done,
I can't ignore them!

00:40.306 --> 00:41.908
That's Ocean Waters.

RANI: Mum's friend.
She was kidnapped by aliens?

00:44.611 --> 00:45.578
Take me, Androvax.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.480
Do it now.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.885
I haven't taken it off
in 40 years.

00:53.653 --> 00:54.654

He's an alien, too.

We only want to save
Androvax's species. Why
won't you help us?

01:29.222 --> 01:30.623
The equilibrium
must be maintained.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.525
What does that mean?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.961
The Veil ship
must not be taken from
the hyper dimensional vault.

01:35.028 --> 01:35.895
And if it is?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.098
The ship's
star drive engines

01:39.165 --> 01:40.934
will disrupt
the vault matrix.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.937
The dimensional disturbance
will tear your planet apart.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.905

will live again!

Hello.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.655
Is Sarah interviewing Ocean?

02:02.722 --> 02:04.691
I knew she'd think
there was a story there.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.697

02:16.503 --> 02:20.874
Did the Alliance of Shades
program you with any

hear about this.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.189
Didn't he say something
about Earth being destroyed?

02:36.256 --> 02:37.824
You're right.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.893
Better call
an extraordinary meeting.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.695
-Clyde.
-What?

02:43.663 --> 02:45.031
What happened?

02:45.098 --> 02:47.133
Don't shoot! That's Clyde,
not Androvax!

02:48.301 --> 02:49.802
Rani, he took your mum.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.671
-And the discs.
-Mum?

02:51.738 --> 02:53.239
SARAH JANE: Oh, no.

02:53.306 --> 02:56.309
He swapped bodies.
He thought it would
slow us down.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.177
MR DREAD:
It will do him no good.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.346
My associates will be
waiting at the vault.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.948
They'll kill my mum.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.883
But we will save your planet.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.587
I'm sorry,

03:07.654 --> 03:09.789
I should've done
something to
stop Androvax.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.524
No, it's not
your fault, Clyde.
It's mine.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.860
I should've kept Androvax
in the containment vortex.

03:13.927 --> 03:14.994
But we need to find her.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.563
-We will.
-Before they do.

03:16.629 --> 03:17.764
We will.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.590
Why did I ever trust Androvax?

03:43.656 --> 03:45.959
You're doing what
you thought was right.
We were trying to help him.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.627
Some people you
just can't help.

03:47.694 --> 03:48.761

Come on. Shift it.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.401
Mr Dread's friends
are still here.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.302
Yeah, but
Androvax is after the vault,

05:03.369 --> 05:05.271
and we still don't know
where it is.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.106
Look, this place is huge.
If we're gonna find Gita,
we should split up.

you can't trust her.

Mum and Dad.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.002
What do you mean?

05:36.069 --> 05:38.104
Well, after they saw
the Judoon with Androvax.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.841
We thought it was funny,
pretending we didn't know
anything about aliens.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.478
It's not much of a joke
now, is it?

05:45.545 --> 05:48.181
What if I'd told them, Clyde?

05:48.247 --> 05:51.217
Maybe none of this
would have happened.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.586
And maybe it wouldn't
have made any difference.

I know Sarah Jane doesn't
believe in fate.

that would be

Yes.

is to hide the existence
of alien life from Earth

the last time you were
out and about
I was still in hot pants.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.236
What happened? Did the
Alliance of Shades realise

08:23.302 --> 08:25.204
that you were doing
such a bad job
they pulled the plug?

08:25.271 --> 08:26.639

guardians of the vault.

reactivated.

remain intact.

Yes, the Veil energy has gone.

13:29.742 --> 13:30.910
Are you an alien?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.679
I'm an android.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.047
And you are my prisoners.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.450
Is there anything I can do?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.820
You heard what
your Xylok said.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.423
Swamp vipers.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.193
They don't give you
any second chances.

13:47.259 --> 13:48.894
No, it doesn't seem like it.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.597
Oh, my people,

13:51.664 --> 13:54.300
if only you could have seen
what they had done.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.902
We had such beauty,
Sarah Jane Smith.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.905
Such humanity.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.309
I'm sorry, Androvax.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.578
To lose a world like that.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.746
I can't imagine
what you must feel like.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.181
To have nothing
and no one left

14:09.248 --> 14:10.482
across the whole universe.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.787
But what you did
was futile and wrong.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.122
I thought you saw that now.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.791
I thought
you wanted redemption.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.460
But you were prepared

14:21.527 --> 14:24.463
to destroy Earth
to bring your people back.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.198
You haven't learned a thing.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.901
But now
I will be among them.

What are you going
to do with us?

15:05.537 --> 15:07.106
I've heard what aliens
do to humans

15:07.172 --> 15:09.041
when they get their
sticky paws on them.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.643
I read it
in the Sunday papers.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.578
All that probing

15:12.645 --> 15:14.079
and implanting.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.415
As an android,
I have no interest
in either

15:16.482 --> 15:19.151
probing or implanting.

15:19.218 --> 15:20.919
But I do have an
interest in the Veil.

15:22.621 --> 15:23.989
He is weak.

15:24.056 --> 15:26.992
He will soon need
another body
to sustain him.

15:27.559 --> 15:28.694
You mean us?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.129
What, you're going
to use us as bait?

15:31.230 --> 15:32.298
No way.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.933
Your approval is not required.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.602
What if he gets
to the vault first?

15:38.070 --> 15:40.472
My associates
will handle that.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.540
No, mate.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.416
Your associates
have been Clydeinated.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.617
Cool shades, though.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.619
Come on. We've got to
find Sarah Jane.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.525
Soon, my brothers
and sisters.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.060
Soon,

16:02.161 --> 16:03.095
I will release you.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.700
And our people will live
again among the stars.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.941

all finished,

16:20.546 --> 16:21.914

16:21.980 --> 16:24.283
I have something important
to take care of.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.418
What happened to Androvax?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.454
The swamp viper venom
took him.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.722
So why are we
opening the vault?

16:30.923 --> 16:32.825
If we can save just
two of his people,

16:32.891 --> 16:35.394
the Veil species
still has a chance.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.030
So there's no need
to start the star drive?

16:38.097 --> 16:41.133
Mr Smith can arrange
for a passing ship
to take them to a new planet.
