{\an8}HOODSEY:
Let's just give
something stupid away

00:57.557 --> 01:00.769
{\an8}like maybe this old toe tag
or maybe the ear wax collection.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.146
{\an8}Doesn't pack the same punch,
Hoods.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.730
{\an8}You know it and I know it.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.941
{\an8}I'm afraid Polly might be right.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.651
{\an8}Oh, come on, Carl,

01:08.735 --> 01:10.487
{\an8}the girl's
a raving lunatic.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.490
{\an7}She made us eat birdseed,
for crying out loud.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.449
{\an7}Noelle says
she puts down newspaper

01:14.532 --> 01:16.910
{\an8}in the girls' room

01:16.993 --> 01:17.660
{\an7}before she...
you know, goes.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.622
{\an8}What she said made sense.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.540
{\an8}What sense is there

01:22.624 --> 01:23.833
{\an8}in giving something away
that makes us happy

01:23.917 --> 01:26.461
{\an8}just for the sake
of growing up?!

01:26.544 --> 01:29.172
{\an8}You think Blake would
give up his tonsils?
No, sir.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.091
{\an7}The more I examine
my attachment to this eyeball,

01:32.175 --> 01:33.676
{\an8}the more I want
to give it up...

01:33.760 --> 01:36.763
{\an7}if only to know
that I can.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.431
{\an8}Oh, brother.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.266
{\an8}Fine, Carl, fine--
I'm done arguing with you.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.770
Go ahead and put that eyeball
in the time capsule,

01:43.853 --> 01:46.356
and I'll give up
my favorite hooded sweatshirt,

01:46.439 --> 01:47.023
the purple one.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.275
Last thing I want is to be told

01:49.359 --> 01:51.444
I'm more immature
than a girl who lays golf balls

01:51.528 --> 01:53.822
like they're eggs.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.110
Oh, my gosh, I've been looking

02:32.193 --> 02:36.030
for this tartan plaid scrunchy
since September.

02:36.114 --> 02:39.075
That's got to be good luck--
and I really need it.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.618
The luck or
the scrunchy?

02:40.702 --> 02:43.246
The luck, of course,
to get on the pep squad.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.290
Okay, here's my plan:
I strut into the cafeteria

02:45.373 --> 02:48.084
while the squad members
are eating their pep burgers--

02:48.167 --> 02:51.087
or whatever they eat
to be so darn peppy--

02:51.170 --> 02:53.548
and then I break out
into a special routine.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.592
Which I'm choreographing
all by myself.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.676
Ooh, preview.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.637
(<i> doing breathy cheer</i> )

02:59.721 --> 03:01.764
Go... Goats!

03:03.558 --> 03:04.684
I'm still working on it.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.685
{\an4}Yeah.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.685
{\an1}You better be,
Bishop.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.688
{\an4}No freshman
has ever been
admitted to the squad.

03:08.771 --> 03:09.981
You're going to need
a lot more than a...

03:10.064 --> 03:12.942
Don't let these two
psyche you out, Dodie.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.320
{\an5}Leandra!

03:13.026 --> 03:15.320
Hey, Leandra.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.320
Hey, Leandra.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.863
Never underestimate
the power

03:16.946 --> 03:18.781
of positive thinking,
my friends.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.410
I've positively moved mountains
just by keeping optimistic.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.453
Thanks.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.831
{\an5}GINGER:
Man, Zorski should
have asked Leandra

03:26.915 --> 03:28.666
to make the graduation speech.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.377
{\an4}I haven't had
anything positive
to say in days.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.171
{\an4}Well, personally,
I'm inspired.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.964
{\an1}I'm going to go work
on my moves.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.549
{\an1}Oh, hey, Leandra,
wait up!

03:36.633 --> 03:37.800
Well, I've got
my own to-do list

03:37.884 --> 03:39.761
forming in
my mind's library.

03:39.844 --> 03:42.138
Want to do all I can

03:42.221 --> 03:44.223
to catch a certain
someone's lazy eye.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.350
(<i> chuckles</i> )

03:45.433 --> 03:46.392
Later much.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.602
Sure, later.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.978
No problem.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.480
Don't even worry about me.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.523
I'll just, uh,
worry about myself.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.526
{\an1}Today, you cats
leave behind yesterday

03:55.610 --> 03:57.654
{\an1}as an investment
in tomorrow.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.865
Dumb, Carl, D-U-M, dumb.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.492
Who wants to go first?

04:02.575 --> 04:05.828
Blake-man, what's
your contribution?

04:05.912 --> 04:09.165
I surrender herewith
my infected tonsils of youth--

04:09.248 --> 04:13.586
the fleshy remains
of my grim encounter

04:13.670 --> 04:15.546
with the medical system.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.757
{\an3}Oh, man.

04:17.839 --> 04:23.262
{\an1}A dear friend, mentor
and a fellow bird enthusiast,

04:23.346 --> 04:28.434
{\an1}Polly Schuster, once said
that a boy is not a man

04:28.518 --> 04:32.021
{\an1}until he has lost
what he holds dear.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.816
{\an1}And while I find
that sentiment

04:34.899 --> 04:37.860
incredibly depressing,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.863
{\an1}I surrender
these pulpous nuggets

04:40.947 --> 04:44.450
in the off chance
that she is right.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.083
According to Polly,

04:52.166 --> 04:54.794
{\an1}it takes a certain
type of maturity

04:54.877 --> 04:57.255
{\an1}to make these kind
of decisions.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.381
To maturity.

04:58.464 --> 04:58.673
To manhood.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.717
To Polly.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.051
This is sick.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.803
Sick, sick, sick!

05:04.679 --> 05:06.889
DODIE:
B-I-S-H-O-P,

05:06.973 --> 05:08.057
Thank you.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.392
Ginger Foutley.

05:11.185 --> 05:11.728
Macie Lightfoot, ma'am.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.313
{\an1}M-A-C-I...

05:14.397 --> 05:14.981
{\an3}There.

05:15.064 --> 05:15.815
Oh, yeah, sorry.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.608
{\an1}Oh, this is it,
our futures.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.861
{\an1}The single slip of paper
that tells us

05:19.944 --> 05:22.363
when to learn, lunch, laugh
and in what order.

05:22.447 --> 05:22.739
{\an1}DARREN:
Hey, don't start

05:22.822 --> 05:25.033
without me!

05:28.453 --> 05:32.040
(<i> all murmuring</i> )

05:34.417 --> 05:35.626
But wait...

05:35.710 --> 05:37.045
We all chose
World Cultures,

05:37.128 --> 05:38.921
but you have it
seventh period,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.423
you have it third
and I have it first.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.801
Uh, Mrs. Jackson,
there's been a mistake.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.429
You see, we're BFFs.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.097
Darren's sort of
an honorary BFF.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.183
{\an1}And we all filled out
our class requests

05:50.266 --> 05:52.727
{\an1}with the same classes
in the exact same order.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.771
Since we always do
everything together.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.356
{\an4}But none of us
are in any of
the same classes.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.900
Uh-huh?

05:58.983 --> 06:00.568
{\an1}Mayhaps there's been
an oversight?

06:00.651 --> 06:03.362
While I'm touched at the
depth of your friendship--

06:03.446 --> 06:04.781
I really am--

06:04.864 --> 06:07.450
I think this little "oversight"
is a perfect example

06:07.533 --> 06:09.285
of what we
in the high school trade

06:09.368 --> 06:10.787
call "conquering our fears."

06:10.870 --> 06:11.329
Embrace it, kids;

06:11.412 --> 06:13.081
change is
a good thing--

06:13.164 --> 06:15.166
that's what growing up
is all about.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.627
Make new friends,
expand your universe,

06:17.710 --> 06:19.378
try salad instead of fries,

06:19.462 --> 06:23.132
because next thing you know,
you'll be on your way to college

06:23.216 --> 06:25.468
in different corners
of the globe--

06:25.551 --> 06:25.927
this one in Tibet...

06:26.010 --> 06:28.137
that one in Detroit.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.472
Detroit!

06:29.555 --> 06:30.807
What's in Detroit?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.308
Tibet, huh?

06:32.391 --> 06:34.769
Always curious
about yakback riding.

06:34.852 --> 06:35.895
Uh-huh.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.193
Hey, Ginger!

06:42.276 --> 06:43.528
Ginger, wait up!

06:43.611 --> 06:44.320
Hey, what's with you?

06:44.403 --> 06:47.073
{\an1}I'm tired of fighting
the inevitable.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.450
The winds are blowing us
in different directions

06:49.534 --> 06:51.828
{\an1}and there's nothing
I can do but roll with it.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.748
{\an4}Everyone besides me
seems to be handling
the changes just fine,

06:55.832 --> 06:58.042
{\an1}so I guess
it's my problem.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.460
Now, come on, babe.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.712
So what if we're not
in the same classes?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.881
It's not like we won't
be seeing each other

07:03.965 --> 07:04.549
all day long anyway.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.426
{\an1}See? You're okay
with it, too.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.304
Yeah, because I know
nothing is going to come

07:10.388 --> 07:11.681
between the two of us.

07:11.764 --> 07:12.932
I promise.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.143
Hey, why don't we go
get some fried cheese

07:15.226 --> 07:16.769
and talk about nothing,
like old times.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.688
Right now?

07:18.771 --> 07:19.689
In 45 minutes--

07:19.772 --> 07:21.149
right after
football practice.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.358
{\an1}See?! It's starting
already, Darren.

07:22.441 --> 07:25.862
{\an1}Soon it's going to be
football games for you,

07:25.945 --> 07:27.655
{\an1}student council meetings
for me,

07:27.738 --> 07:29.365
pep squad for old Detroit here.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.534
Pep squad-- you
really think so?!

07:31.617 --> 07:32.869
And lazy eye
for Macie!

07:32.952 --> 07:33.619
Oh...

07:33.703 --> 07:36.038
Our universe is
expanding, right?

07:36.122 --> 07:38.207
So let's just embrace it...

07:38.291 --> 07:38.583
later!

07:55.600 --> 07:55.892
(<i> sighs</i> )

07:55.975 --> 07:57.935
Of course...

07:58.019 --> 08:00.479
It's a pile of laundry, Carl,
clean linens.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.022
What'd you expect?

08:01.105 --> 08:03.399
Don't be so juvenile.

08:03.482 --> 08:04.025
(<i> clattering</i> )

08:04.108 --> 08:06.485
Ready to roll,
brother?

08:06.569 --> 08:07.945
{\an1}What happened
to the patient?

08:08.029 --> 08:10.531
It was just sitting
outside the bathroom door.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.909
Hoodsey, someone
may actually need that!

08:12.992 --> 08:14.076
Go put it back!

08:14.160 --> 08:17.330
Right-- that's, uh, very
responsible of you there, Carl.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.165
{\an4}LOIS:
Carl, what are
you doing here

08:19.248 --> 08:22.335
besides challenging
the infirmed?

08:22.418 --> 08:23.753
No such thing, Mother.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.838
We just dropped by
to say hello

08:25.922 --> 08:27.048
and to give you these.

08:27.131 --> 08:27.590
Oh, isn't that sweet?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.258
Carl?

08:29.342 --> 08:32.428
No one had to die
for those, Mother.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.013
I've turned over a new leaf--
promise.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.265
He's right, Mrs. Foutley.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.683
We bought them at cost

08:37.767 --> 08:39.268
from a discharged patient.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.437
{\an1}Well, would you boys
care to join us

08:41.520 --> 08:42.313
{\an1}for dinner
in the cafeteria?

08:42.395 --> 08:45.316
{\an1}It is Salisbury steak night,
you know.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.692
Sounds delightful.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.276
What he said.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.029
Carl, want baked potato

08:50.112 --> 08:52.740
to go with that
Jell-O of yours?

08:52.823 --> 08:54.325
That's vile.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.952
Maybe so,
but it's his fave.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.829
The kid has some quirky food
preferences, I tell you.

08:58.913 --> 08:59.789
Those days
are behind me now;

08:59.872 --> 09:02.833
I have matured.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.212
I can enjoy the Salisbury steak,
the potatoes

09:06.295 --> 09:09.966
and the creamed spinach
just as they are served to me.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.051
I'll save my dessert
for dessert.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.386
Hmm, I'm impressed.

09:13.469 --> 09:17.139
{\an1}So, it's Jell-O inside
the potato, you say?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.433
I got to admit,
I was a little concerned

09:19.517 --> 09:21.143
{\an1}about how you two kids
would fare

09:21.227 --> 09:22.228
with all that's going on,

09:22.311 --> 09:25.064
{\an1}but talk about
your shining colors.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.359
{\an1}Carl, it's like you're
a whole different person.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.318
{\an3}Yeah...

09:29.402 --> 09:32.113
{\an1}Hmm, that's not bad,
not bad at all.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.907
I just want you to know,
I'm proud of you, Carl--

09:34.991 --> 09:37.076
I mean that.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.995
You hear that, Hoods?

09:39.078 --> 09:40.162
{\an1}My mother
is proud of me.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.248
You know, I really think

09:42.331 --> 09:43.332
{\an1}you might be on
to something here.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.377
Mother, as best man
at your wedding,

09:46.460 --> 09:47.420
I would like to nominate Hoodsey

09:47.503 --> 09:50.423
{\an1}to be a fellow groomsman
in the party.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.175
{\an1}It may not yet be noticed
by the human eye,

09:53.259 --> 09:55.428
{\an1}but he, too,
is on the road to maturity.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.096
Plus, I clean up pretty good.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.098
No arguments here.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.183
We'd love to have you, Hoodsey.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.644
{\an1}Would you just try this,
Lois, please?

10:03.728 --> 10:08.232
<i>They say that high school</i>
<i>is the first step</i>

10:08.316 --> 10:10.651

(<i> yawns</i> )

10:13.487 --> 10:17.325
(<i> class bell ringing</i> )

10:17.408 --> 10:19.869
(<i> distorted</i> ):
Hi, guys.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.037
What's up?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.998
Dode, Mace, guys?

10:24.081 --> 10:25.374
Wait up.

10:25.458 --> 10:25.708
Huh?

10:34.050 --> 10:34.717
(<i> door creaks</i> )

10:37.762 --> 10:38.637
(<i> gasps</i> )

10:39.847 --> 10:42.475
Hey, hey, hey,
over here.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.770
That's what I'm talking about.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.606
Look out!

10:49.315 --> 10:50.608
(<i> screams</i> )

10:50.691 --> 10:51.901
My nose!

10:51.984 --> 10:53.569
{\an1}Dodie,
are you okay?

10:53.652 --> 10:55.237
Darren?

10:55.321 --> 10:55.905
Guys?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.698
Come back.

11:01.160 --> 11:01.410
Ben!

11:01.494 --> 11:03.245
(<i> laughs</i> )

11:03.329 --> 11:04.413
Don't.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.748
{\an1}JONAS:
Sit, Ben.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.083
{\an1}Ben, sit.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.501
Dad, hi.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.960
Hi!

11:10.044 --> 11:12.129
{\an1}You, uh,
doing your homework?

11:12.213 --> 11:15.591
Um, trying to write
my graduation speech.

11:15.674 --> 11:16.675
Graduation?

11:16.759 --> 11:17.676
Am I invited?

11:17.760 --> 11:20.054
Depends. Are you
going to show up?

11:20.137 --> 11:21.430
Will there be free food?

11:21.972 --> 11:23.349
I'm kidding, sweetheart,

11:23.432 --> 11:24.433
I'm kidding.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.434
Badly timed jokes--

11:25.518 --> 11:27.103
they're my forte,
you know.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.813
Yeah, well,
just promise

11:28.896 --> 11:30.272
not to throw
free food at me

11:30.356 --> 11:31.899
when I bomb
tomorrow, okay?

11:31.982 --> 11:33.609
{\an1}You won't bomb,
I know you won't.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.278
It's impossible to write
an uplifting speech

11:36.362 --> 11:38.322
when I don't have
anything good to say

11:38.406 --> 11:40.074
about graduating.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.784
I'm the only one
of all my friends

11:41.867 --> 11:43.869
who's not excited
about moving on.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.912
Why's that?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.122
I don't know.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.457
Maybe because it
involves letting go

11:48.541 --> 11:50.668
and I'm all about...
holding on.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.795
{\an1}But you can't hold on
too tight, right?

11:52.878 --> 11:55.798
{\an1}Or else something that
was born to fly might just...

11:55.881 --> 11:57.174
Die-- Dad, let it go.

11:57.258 --> 11:57.800
{\an1}I will.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.885
{\an1}I was just
making a point.

12:02.805 --> 12:06.851
{\an1}See how beautiful that looks,
up there in the sky?

12:06.934 --> 12:07.309
I... I guess.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.145
Here's the thing.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.105
{\an1}The tighter you hold on
to something,

12:11.188 --> 12:13.816
{\an1}especially something
that needs change and growth,

12:13.899 --> 12:16.652
the more great a chance
you stand of losing it.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.238
{\an1}I think I might have learned
that the hard way.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.699
{\an1}But if you let it go,
if you let it fly

12:21.782 --> 12:25.411
{\an1}at the time that it
most desperately needs to,

12:25.494 --> 12:28.581
{\an4}well, there's a darn
good chance it may
come back to you.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.331
Hey.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.833
{\an1}(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Whew.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.335
Thanks for backing me up
on that one, little guy.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.045
You don't know
how lucky you are

12:35.129 --> 12:37.590
{\an5}that you don't
have to give
a graduation speech.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.591
You know, there's
a legend that says

12:38.674 --> 12:40.551
{\an1}if you tell your wish
to a butterfly,

12:40.634 --> 12:43.304
{\an1}it'll carry it up
to the Great Spirit

12:43.387 --> 12:44.513
and grant it for you.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.514
Really?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.183
It's worth a try.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.309
{\an1}See you tomorrow,
Ginger.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.518

12:52.354 --> 12:54.023

<i>a cross-country road trip.</i>

Hoods!

13:21.342 --> 13:23.719
I've got chest hair!

13:23.802 --> 13:25.721
As well you
should, Carl.

13:25.804 --> 13:26.263
We're adults now.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.474
There's hair everywhere.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.391
Look at my ears.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.393
But we're, like, 11.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.895
Are we?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.147
Are we really?

13:35.231 --> 13:36.565
We don't act like it.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.442
We're mature, grown up,
well-behaved

13:38.526 --> 13:41.820
and we practice proper hygiene.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.200
My good knee aches.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.244
Must be fixing
to rain.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.245
I don't want to be a man.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.496
This is all wrong.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.123
I'll tell you
what's wrong--

13:53.207 --> 13:55.251
those ratty sneakers of yours.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.253
There's nothing more depressing

13:57.336 --> 13:59.255
than a grown man
dressing like a kid.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.339
But, Hoods...

14:00.422 --> 14:01.340
Save it, Carl.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.968
The bulldozer's about
to level the dog house.

It's practically
an emergency.

Carl, I was just about
to swim with dolphins

14:34.999 --> 14:36.542
that sang in a rock band.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.460
Well, I just saw our future.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.422
I was covered in hair
and your knee went bad

14:41.505 --> 14:43.799
and we're
totally boring.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.801
Come on, let's get
down to that school

14:45.884 --> 14:47.636
to reclaim the spirit
of our youth

14:47.720 --> 14:49.638
{\an5}that we buried
in that dumb
time capsule.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.515
What do you mean
my knee went bad?

14:51.599 --> 14:52.474
{\an1}How bad?

14:52.558 --> 14:53.976
Maybe I should
go easy on it.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.311
{\an1}Maybe you should
carry me.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.731
Oh, carry me, Carl!

15:01.984 --> 15:03.652
Maybe this isn't
a good idea, Carl.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.489
I mean, we're talking
school property.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.741
It's my property.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.244
{\an1}My boyish charm is
in that eyeball, Hoods,

15:12.328 --> 15:13.871
and I want it back.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.665
{\an1}Yeah, well I hope they
let you take it to prison

15:16.749 --> 15:17.416

Wow!

16:47.005 --> 16:49.508
Mom, you look... great.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.594
{\an4}Thanks-- of course,
I can't eat as much
as a carrot stick

16:52.678 --> 16:55.055
{\an5}or else the seams
will give out,
but I'm in it!

16:55.139 --> 16:56.765
{\an1}Oh, I am so proud
of you, Mom.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.601
I'm the one that
should be proud--

the graduate speaker.

17:00.811 --> 17:05.065
{\an5}I saw how late
you were working on
that speech of yours.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.025
Believe it or not,
something Dad said

helped me gain new perspective
on the thing.

Well, I'll be.

I can't wait to see you
up there today, kiddo.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.622

17:54.072 --> 17:55.866
That's okay, Ginger.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.327
You haven't used nearly
as many freak-out chips

17:58.410 --> 18:00.454
{\an1}as Macie and I have
over the years.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.414
Oh!

18:02.498 --> 18:04.166
I didn't mean
to hold on so tight.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.959
I just got
a little clingy.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.087
{\an5}We may be heading
different ways
in high school,

18:09.171 --> 18:10.756
but I just want
you to know,

18:10.839 --> 18:12.633
I'll always
be here for you.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.885
{\an1}Best friends forever,
remember?

18:14.968 --> 18:16.220
(<i> Macie clears throat</i> )

18:17.554 --> 18:19.515
Cola Number Five.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.016
You like?

18:21.099 --> 18:23.143
Oh, wow, Macie.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.853
You look hot.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.355
(<i> laughs</i> )

18:26.438 --> 18:28.524
Figured it was time
to kick it up a notch.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.401
You know, we're almost not
in junior high school anymore.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.194
ALL:
Oh.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.657
{\an1}I have something
for you, Mace.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.243
Sweet.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.121
(<i> grunts</i> )

18:43.205 --> 18:45.499
{\an1}DODIE:
Ow, my nose!

18:46.458 --> 18:48.043
(<i> grunting</i> )

18:48.126 --> 18:48.460
(<i> laughter</i> )

18:48.544 --> 18:51.213
Hello, boy.

18:51.296 --> 18:51.713
Long time, no see.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.632
Oh, no offense intended.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.425
About that favor...

18:55.509 --> 18:57.594
As promised.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.721
I intend to chat you up
to any girl in my grade.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.307
You just say
who and when.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.060
Her, and now.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.312
Ohh!

19:07.396 --> 19:09.439
Consider it done.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.899
(<i> kisses</i> )

19:13.777 --> 19:15.445
Hey, guys--
big day.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.405
Hello, Darren.

19:16.488 --> 19:16.989
Hi, Darren.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.783
Whoa, Dodie,
are you okay?

19:19.867 --> 19:20.951
Oh, yep, sure.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.452
Almost stopped.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.913
Darren, I, um...

19:24.997 --> 19:26.290
No, no, me first.

19:26.373 --> 19:30.127
{\an1}The tiniest flower is
the tiniest step towards...

19:30.210 --> 19:33.422
{\an5}I don't know, not
biting each other's
heads off anymore?

19:33.505 --> 19:34.590
It's me, Darren.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.424
I'm sorry.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.760
I've been so wound up
about everything.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.554
{\an1}I want you to know
I'm committed

19:40.637 --> 19:43.432
{\an1}to being your boyfriend
for as long as you'll have me,

19:43.515 --> 19:46.101
and I won't let anything
get in the way of that.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.436
I'm not going to give up.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.938
If you become president
of the student council,

19:50.022 --> 19:51.481
{\an1}then I'll just be
Mr. and Mrs. President.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.859
(<i> giggles</i> )

19:53.942 --> 19:55.277
Oh, I'd be
just as happy

19:55.360 --> 19:57.195
to be the
quarterback's girl.

19:59.823 --> 20:03.410
Let's form two lines, kids.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.162
You look great.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.247
Congratulations to you all.

20:07.331 --> 20:11.543
(<i> students cheering</i> )

20:22.763 --> 20:26.224
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>There's a big difference</i>
<i>between the things we want</i>

20:26.308 --> 20:27.809
<i>and the things we wish for.</i>

20:27.893 --> 20:30.520
<i>The things we want are usually</i>
<i>pretty superficial--</i>

20:30.604 --> 20:35.192
<i>a new outfit, an invitation</i>
<i>to some cool kid's party.</i>

20:35.275 --> 20:37.319
<i>But when we dare</i>
<i>to make a wish,</i>

20:37.402 --> 20:40.030
<i>it's usually for something</i>
<i>more important</i>

20:40.113 --> 20:43.033
<i>and sometimes more elusive,</i>

20:43.116 --> 20:45.744
<i>the kind of thing that</i>
<i>you can't really control,</i>

20:45.827 --> 20:47.120
<i>but you hope</i>
<i>will come true,</i>

20:47.204 --> 20:51.917
<i>like holding on</i>
<i>to your best friends forever</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:54.544
<i>or seeing your dad show up</i>
<i>at graduation.</i>

21:00.092 --> 21:03.178
(<i> applause</i> )

21:03.261 --> 21:05.889
When we came
to Lucky Junior High,

21:05.973 --> 21:08.684
we looked funny,
we walked funny.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.227
We built cocoons
around ourselves

21:10.310 --> 21:14.189
until we could figure out
who we really were.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.566
We made friends,
we lost friends.

21:16.650 --> 21:20.696
Transformation is never easy,
but it made us who we are today.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.030
Butterflies--

21:22.114 --> 21:25.659
all of us here today
are butterflies.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.286
We come in different shapes
and colors...

21:28.370 --> 21:30.205
including Cola Number Five.

21:30.288 --> 21:31.790
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:31.873 --> 21:33.917
But we all have
one thing in common.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.627
We stand here today,

21:35.711 --> 21:38.213
poised to spread our wings
and take flight.

21:38.296 --> 21:41.550
According to Native American
legend,

21:41.633 --> 21:44.511
you can tell a butterfly
your wish

21:44.594 --> 21:47.597
and it will take that wish
up to the heavens

21:47.681 --> 21:48.682
and grant it for you.

21:48.765 --> 21:49.933
I taught her that.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.270
So make your wish, butterflies--

21:53.353 --> 21:54.521
all of you.

21:55.939 --> 21:56.898
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

21:56.982 --> 22:01.111
(<i> applause and cheers</i> )

22:20.255 --> 22:24.384
Don't let her get too far away
from me, okay?
