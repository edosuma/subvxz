00:00.918 --> 00:02.669
PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar...

00:02.753 --> 00:03.837
This is a good office.

00:03.921 --> 00:05.339
The one next door has a much nicer view.

00:05.422 --> 00:07.216
They want me to run White Collar Division?

00:07.299 --> 00:09.259
Consider it a stepping stone to DC.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.470
-NEAL: <i>What's the gold for, Hagen?</i>
-CURTIS: <i>Why does that matter to you?</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:13.430
Because I can tell
when I've stepped into a trap.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.765
You're gonna help set me free.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.267
My new handler, is he in there?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.436
Special Agent David Siegel.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.021
Neal Caffrey is a confidence man.

00:21.104 --> 00:24.733
He preys on trust, desire
and impressionability.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.110
-I'm no lap dog, sir.
-Sure as hell fooled me.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.195
I'm hoping I fooled him too.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.947
-You were playing him?
-I was handling him.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.365
Curtis Hagen is back.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.867
I guess an appellate court
granted him a new trial.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.035
Think he has a chance?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.912
PETER: <i>No.</i>
<i>All the proof of his guilt is upstairs.</i>

00:37.663 --> 00:39.373
MOZZIE: <i>Hey, you paid the piper.</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:40.916
That's the end, isn't it?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.501
It's just the beginning.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.928
-WOMAN: Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.389
DAVID: I'm disappointed in you, Caffrey.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.643
You're not a coffee fan?

01:00.143 --> 01:02.980
-You're never gonna fit in in this city.
-Nah.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.064
I saw by your anklet

01:04.147 --> 01:05.899
you were out front of
Midtown Mutual here.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.943
I was wondering
if I was gonna see you at work.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.820
-I'm reformed, Agent Siegel.
-Uh-huh.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.905
Just a man trying to get his fix
on the way to the office.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.575
You're gonna waste a lot of time
keeping an eye this close on me.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.659
I don't plan to.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.202
I was looking for you
'cause I need your help.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.079
Why? What's the case?

01:19.329 --> 01:20.831
I'm looking for an apartment.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.876
Apartment hunting isn't exactly
my area of expertise.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.169
But New York is.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.379
I figure if anybody knows an area
to move to, it'd be you.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.299
Oh. Where you live in the city
reflects who you are.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.050
So who is Agent David Siegel?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.344
Recently divorced.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.429
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:35.512 --> 01:38.056
Figured you already know that
from some kind of tell I have, or...

01:38.140 --> 01:39.266
Phantom ring.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.060
You start to play with it,
then realize it's not there anymore.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.312
-Ah.
-Yep, just like that.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.730
That I do.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.607
So I'm a...

01:46.690 --> 01:50.110
I'm a man starting over.
What better place than New York, right?

01:50.194 --> 01:51.528
All right.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.031
How do you feel about ironic eyewear?

01:55.157 --> 01:56.450
Sad for humanity.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.785
That rules out
Williamsburg and Greenpoint.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.787
Gentrifying areas with a little danger?

02:00.913 --> 02:02.831
I prefer my danger to be work-related.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.958
No Bushwick then.
What's your price range?

02:05.042 --> 02:07.377
-Price doesn't matter.
-(LAUGHS) It does in New York.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.213
Unless you're secretly rich.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.299
You're secretly rich.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.135
Surprised Neal Caffrey.
I guess I'm doing something right here.

02:15.219 --> 02:18.931
It's easy then. Greenwich Village.
Plenty of culture, central location.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.015
And as a native of Chicago,

02:20.098 --> 02:22.601
you will appreciate
the best pizza in New York.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.061
I'll check it out.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.312
Why'd you choose where you live?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.189
It's in my radius.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.816
Yeah. Right. Yeah, radius.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.824
Are we talking Hilton rich?

02:37.908 --> 02:38.909
Hearst?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.787
-Do you own your own yacht?
-Not in the office, Caffrey.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.830
I don't want anyone to know about it.
Is that clear?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.749
All right,
you want to give a con man a secret?

02:45.832 --> 02:47.918
You live a dangerous life, Agent Siegel.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.588
God, the finger point again.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.881
I'll get to work.

(PETER WHISTLES)

02:56.593 --> 02:58.637
I guess that one's for me.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.889
Her name was <i>Stephanie.</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:03.183
What, your ex-wife?

03:03.267 --> 03:04.518
My yacht.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.144
-I knew it.
-All right.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.354
(SHUSHING)

03:07.437 --> 03:08.772
I knew it.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.608
You've grown power-hungry
with the pointy fingers,

03:11.692 --> 03:12.693
you know that, right?

03:12.776 --> 03:14.403
And please tell me
you don't do it to Elizabeth.

(SIGHS)

03:15.612 --> 03:18.866
Curtis Hagen was granted early release
from prison today.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.742
And like his namesake,

03:20.826 --> 03:24.288
the Dutchman will probably
disappear into the night again.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.372
How'd he get off?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.875
Some evidence was damaged
in the warehouse.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.627
His lawyer saw an opening and took it.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.297
-Takes me back.
-Hmm.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.008
Look how far we've come since that case.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.385
-You've come.
-Excuse me?

03:39.136 --> 03:42.014
You're in Hughes' office,
with a well-deserved promotion.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.850
I'm still on an anklet,
just with somebody new holding the leash.

03:44.933 --> 03:49.980
You've gone from an incarcerated con man
to an invaluable part of this FBI team.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.565
That is nothing to sniff at.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.567
Hagen's free. I'm not.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.113
You're right. He's free. For now.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.866
He's a career criminal.
He'll make a mistake.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.160
And when he does, we'll catch him.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.038
Or at least you and Siegel will.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.166
-We'll keep an eye out.
-Good.

NEAL: Interesting choice
for a meeting place.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.697
Are you deciding on your next forgery?

04:41.156 --> 04:43.659
I left that behind me, Mr. Caffrey.

04:43.909 --> 04:44.910
Hmm.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.330
Prison changed me, as I'm sure it did you.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.041
It didn't, actually.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.837
No, apparently not. More's the pity.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.173
I did what you asked. Hagen, you're free.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.676
You did. It was a lovely start.

05:00.759 --> 05:04.304
No. I'm done. It's over.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.558
I'm the one who decides when it's over,
not you.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.644
Is that all you called me here for?
To threaten me?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.062
Not at all.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.400
There's something here I want to steal.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.611
-And here I thought prison changed you.
-It did.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.365
No more forgery,
no more getting my hands dirty.

(NEAL LAUGHING)

05:55.105 --> 05:56.231
So you find me amusing?

05:56.315 --> 05:59.067
You realize
you've shot yourself in the foot, right?

06:00.027 --> 06:03.822
I'm on an anklet,
which means the FBI knows I've been here.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.450
So if I boost this painting,
they'll know it was me.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.702
Then I'll be back in jail
and no good to you.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.786
Oh!

06:10.287 --> 06:14.416
Well, I suppose you're going to have to be
extra clever then, aren't you?

06:15.501 --> 06:17.586
At which, so far, you're failing.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.589
I don't want this painting.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.634
This Karen Kates is the most
valuable piece in the museum.

NEAL: The <i>Mosconi Codex.</i>

06:40.609 --> 06:42.945
You want me to risk jail
for a little light reading?

06:43.028 --> 06:46.782
This is no ordinary book.
And well worth that risk.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.285
-To you, maybe.
-Yes, to me.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.914

Which one would you like?

07:36.415 --> 07:37.666
-Hi.
-Hey.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.171
So, can I check out the codex or...

07:42.504 --> 07:43.505
Oh, uh...

07:43.881 --> 07:47.259
Sorry. Uh... I wish I could,
but no one can check it out.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.178
I mean, it can't even be opened.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.097
A book that no one can open. That's cruel.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.933
I... I agree.

07:55.017 --> 07:59.897
And this one, the <i>Mosconi Codex,</i>
it's a riddle,

08:00.355 --> 08:02.274
wrapped in an enigma,

08:02.357 --> 08:06.236
wrapped in a shatterproof glass box.

I mean, I would give my left arm
to peek inside it.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.576
Sorry. I'm rambling.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.287
It's just the codex. It's a...
It's a pet obsession of mine.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.456
I respect a good obsession.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.542
What makes it so valuable?

08:21.793 --> 08:25.005
So before he died, Mosconi claimed

08:25.088 --> 08:28.175
that the greatest wealth in the world
was within its pages.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.220
Oh, that's an easy thing to claim
for a book that no one can open.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.139
That's true. But...

08:34.431 --> 08:37.518
I mean,
it could be the key to enlightenment

08:37.601 --> 08:39.353
or a list of his favorite recipes.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.189
Why not take a look inside and find out?

08:42.898 --> 08:45.234
The owner gave strict instructions
in the lending

08:45.317 --> 08:47.486
that it can't be opened.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.821
The owner. Oh. Who is the owner?

08:50.364 --> 08:51.782
-Anonymous.
-Of course.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.159
Adds to the intrigue, doesn't it?

08:54.243 --> 08:57.829
So we're just left to
judge a book by its cover.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.291
So there's no way
to find out what's inside?

09:01.375 --> 09:02.417
No way.

09:02.501 --> 09:06.672
Though Mosconi did gild
the first page of every chapter,

09:06.755 --> 09:09.633
-so we know there are 25 of them...
-Twenty-five, yeah.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.053
-Taunting me with their secrets.
-Huh.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.472
Yeah.

Is your limo in the shop?

10:21.747 --> 10:23.916
-He swears they exist.
-Better.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.084
I can't imagine
what you'd think is better than that.

10:26.585 --> 10:27.669
This is.

-Peter, thank you.
-Oh, you deserve it.

I'm just the lucky guy
who gets to give you your button.

-I'm proud of you.
-Thank you.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.570
Congratulations,
Supervisory Special Agent Jones.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.073
-Sounds important.
-Yeah, a little more autonomy.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.407
A lot more work.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.576
-So you're happy.
-Oh, very.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.538
Although somehow, I think
he's a bit happier about it than I am.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.956
NEAL: Uh-huh.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.500
Listen, we are probably
going to go celebrate.

-You want to join us?
-Uh, next time.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.796
No autonomy, still a lot of work.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.339
All right. All right, next time.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.633
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, man.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.302
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

11:27.896 --> 11:29.982
MOZZIE: I'll help you on one condition.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.859
You want to know what's inside the codex.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.486
Precisely the opposite.
I don't want to lay eyes on it.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.114
As long as you're working with
"Suit the Sequel,"

11:37.197 --> 11:38.907
I have to become a new man.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.243
What do you think?

11:41.326 --> 11:43.412
-Too Ringo?
-Too Bieber.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.081
Look, if you want to redefine yourself,
you should become a teetotaler.

11:46.164 --> 11:49.376
(SCOFFS)
There's some lies even I can't sell.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.253
Look, I appreciate your identity crisis,

11:51.336 --> 11:54.089
but I need to focus on
how to steal the codex.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.384
Con Suit 2.0 into removing your anklet.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.970
Siegel's never taken my anklet off before.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.972
The first time he does,
he's gonna be on high alert.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.140
I can't risk it.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.725
Besides,
it already shows me at the museum.

12:04.808 --> 12:07.311
I need to find a reason to be there.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.230
We can piggyback.

12:10.606 --> 12:13.025
Convince someone else to rob the museum.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.569
Two thieves go in,
and one comes out in cuffs.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.114
And if you're investigating
a possible robbery,

12:19.198 --> 12:20.824
you have every reason to be there.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.451
Yeah, but who do we piggyback?

12:22.534 --> 12:24.369
I mean, it's got to be
someone good enough to pull it off,

12:24.453 --> 12:26.622
but someone we don't mind screwing over.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.166
-Zev.
-Who's that?

12:29.583 --> 12:32.711
Zev is a besmirchment
on the name of con men.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.380
Remember the De Beers
diamond vault heist?

12:35.589 --> 12:37.049
Yeah, you spent months working on it,

12:37.132 --> 12:38.842
and then someone got there
an hour ahead of you.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.553
And pulled off the heist
exactly as I planned it.

12:41.637 --> 12:44.556
That was Zev. That's what he does.
He's an idea-napper.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.184
The thief of thieves.
And now we can use it against him.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.312
And I get to cross a name
off my enemies list.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.523
You know, for most people,
that's a metaphor.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.941
It's not an actual list.

12:55.651 --> 12:56.652
Good?

12:59.821 --> 13:03.492
So, what can we have Zev steal?

13:05.744 --> 13:07.329
A Karen Kates painting.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.791
I'm telling you, Barry, it's just
sitting there waiting to be grabbed.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.044
I've got it all worked out.
It's the perfect plan.

13:15.254 --> 13:17.297
I'll spell out all the details for Zev.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.425
While you do that, I'll convince Siegel
that someone's gonna rob the museum.

13:20.509 --> 13:21.552
I'm hearing chatter.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.930
I don't know who the thief is,
but word is it's gonna happen soon.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.057
Stakeouts are time-intensive, Neal.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.102
I mean, "soon" could mean
you and me sitting out there for weeks.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.396
-You sure?
-Yeah, it's good intel.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.317
Look, you know what?
I don't want to push it, so...

13:37.901 --> 13:39.069
No, no, no.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.865
Tell you what.
I'll run it up the flagpole.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.700
All right.

13:46.577 --> 13:47.828
What?

13:48.704 --> 13:50.831
I just feel like
I should be the one to pitch it to Peter.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.541
Why is that?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.376
I don't want you putting your neck
on the line.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.586
It's my intel.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.088
I should be responsible for it
in case it's bad.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.716
-I'll pitch it to Peter.
-Okay.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.261
All right, Siegel is paranoid
that I'm always pulling a con.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.805
So we'll use that to launder
the con through him.

14:06.889 --> 14:10.392
By the time Peter hears about it,
it'll sound like it was all Siegel's idea.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.020
-You feel good about this intel?
-I do.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.105
My source seemed pretty confident.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.982
Already with reliable sources.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.109
Haven't wasted any time
since coming to the city.

14:19.193 --> 14:21.570
The wicked don't rest.
Neither should we, right?

14:21.695 --> 14:22.696
PETER: (LAUGHING) No.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.157
I have to say I'm jealous.
I love a good stakeout.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.992
You're welcome to join us.

14:27.201 --> 14:29.119
I wouldn't mind if I do.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.663
That'd be great, but come on,
you have the Yankees game today.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.958
-I do. I do. Maybe tomorrow then.
-Sure.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.420
Stakeout approved. Good luck, you two.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.797
Won't be the same without you.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.273
JONES: Hey, Peter.
I have more forms for you to sign.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.151
And I'm gonna have carpal tunnel
by the end of the month.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.987
I don't know
how Hughes handled all this paperwork.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.073
He had a stamp with his signature on it.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.242
With Caffrey around, I'll risk the carpal.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.369
Is it strange?

15:10.452 --> 15:11.495
Hmm?

15:11.578 --> 15:14.498
Yeah, I mean, seeing Caffrey
running around on cases with Siegel,

15:14.581 --> 15:15.958
and you're sitting up here?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.043
It is.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.880
It is, but there are a lot of changes
going on around here.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.300
I mean, your promotion,
Diana's baby, Siegel.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.761
Change is good.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.974
-Yankees tickets are good.
-Yes. Yes, Yankees tickets.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.435
Which reminds me, I have to get going.

15:35.811 --> 15:39.648
I've got to jump on our underground street
to beat traffic.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.775
Long story.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.278
When's the last time
you checked Caffrey's anklet?

15:44.403 --> 15:45.404
Mmm.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.322
-Peter?
-Ten minutes ago.

15:47.406 --> 15:50.409
He's home, probably painting something
he shouldn't be.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.493
(JONES CHUCKLES)

15:53.537 --> 15:57.165
Ah! Baked parchment.
Just like Momma used to make.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.252
All right, the book is attached
to an A90 pressure plate,

16:00.335 --> 16:02.379
so I won't be able to remove it.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.965
Fortunately, we only need Chapter 13.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.676
How frustratingly intriguing of him.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.178
At least we know where the chapter is.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.597
Thirteen gilded pages means
13 chapters.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.265
Let's hope
Mosconi didn't write a foreword.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.560
If all Hagen wants is the chapter,
then it's not about the value of the book.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.605
No. It's about
the information on the pages.

16:20.772 --> 16:24.026
Moz, you can leave those pages blank.
Nobody's going to see them.

16:24.109 --> 16:27.654
Ah! Not soon. No.
But eventually, they will.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.323
And when that day comes,

16:29.406 --> 16:32.534
my manifesto will finally get
the attention it deserves.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.870
Uh-huh. Do you think Zev took the bait?

16:35.162 --> 16:37.748
I followed him this morning.
He's already prepping for it.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.791
The museum closes at 5:30.

16:39.875 --> 16:43.170
I said that I was turning off
the security cameras at 6:00 p.m.

16:43.295 --> 16:46.465
And that I was breaking in
15 minutes later, just to be safe.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.342
Which means Zev will break in at 6:00.

16:48.425 --> 16:52.679
In reality, I'm doing all that at 5:50.
That's when you go in.

16:52.971 --> 16:55.349
All right, so I got 10 minutes
until Zev gets there,

16:55.432 --> 16:58.018
I'll steal it, get out,
and then arrest him with Siegel.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.188
We know Zev will find a way in.
What's yours?

17:16.495 --> 17:18.080
You never gave me your name.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.541
-Hi.
-Hey.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.502
Didn't I? (LAUGHING) Sorry.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.170
-Rebecca.
-Neal.

17:25.254 --> 17:26.797
I was hoping I'd run into you.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.298
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.219
I was also hoping I'd get here
before the museum closed, but...

17:32.344 --> 17:35.889
-One out of two isn't bad.
-No. It's definitely not.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.142
Oh!

17:39.226 --> 17:41.728
I always forget to take this thing off.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.690
I swear I think... I think
I even wore it to dinner last week.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.405
I have something here I thought
you might be able to help me out with.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.616
-What is it?
-You tell me.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.162
REBECCA: How old is this?

17:59.454 --> 18:02.040
-I mean, it looks Mid-Renaissance...
-Yeah.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.711
But there's a rhythm
to the language that's...

18:08.338 --> 18:12.634
If I didn't know better, I'd say
that's the President in a flying saucer.

18:12.759 --> 18:17.014
Okay, whoever did this
is either brilliant or insane.

18:21.185 --> 18:22.477
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.190
Oh, my gosh, I, um...

18:26.857 --> 18:29.151
-I have a thing that I am late for...
-Yeah.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.611
That now I really wish I didn't have...

18:30.694 --> 18:32.112
-I understand.
-But I am.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.197
I better...

18:33.989 --> 18:35.532
-Rebecca.
-Yeah?

18:37.326 --> 18:38.744
I need that back.

18:40.621 --> 18:42.122
Right. Sorry.

18:42.706 --> 18:43.707
(SIGHS)

18:43.999 --> 18:45.375
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:56.345 --> 18:58.222
-NEAL: Hey.
-Get in.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.724
Let's set up our post across the street.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.147
DAVID: Showing up early. I like that.

19:07.231 --> 19:09.942
NEAL: I wanted to get a quick look
at the museum beforehand.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.403
But you knew that
from checking on my anklet.

19:13.487 --> 19:14.947
Didn't check.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.365
Yet.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.493
I was too busy apartment
shopping over in the Village.

19:19.618 --> 19:21.203
What'd you think?

19:21.328 --> 19:24.414
You may be a con man,
but you were right about that pizza.

19:24.498 --> 19:25.916
What'd I tell you?

19:25.999 --> 19:27.125
So I got you something.

19:28.418 --> 19:32.464
Aw, man. You didn't have to.
Thank you. I didn't get you anything.

19:32.798 --> 19:35.425
You catch me a bad guy,
we'll call it even.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.594
All right.

19:37.803 --> 19:41.974
Well, I have to say,
the owner's box has officially spoiled me.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.184
That's the only way to watch a ball game
from now on.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.436
-You and me both.
-Oh... Really?

19:47.312 --> 19:49.690
I didn't think you were watching the game
half the time.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.734
Well, all that glad-handing
can be a bit distracting.

19:52.818 --> 19:53.819
ELIZABETH: Mmm.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.946
Wasn't what I was talking about.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.489
I mean, yes,
Peter Burke was there watching,

19:57.573 --> 20:00.576
but it seemed like
your mind was somewhere else.

20:00.659 --> 20:02.911
Could it have been a stakeout?

20:05.455 --> 20:07.666
I used to live for a stakeout.

20:08.333 --> 20:12.963
The radio, deviled ham from my wife,
good conversation,

20:13.463 --> 20:15.465
and then arresting the bad guy.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.510
And now you're stuck eating amazing food,

20:18.594 --> 20:21.638
watching your favorite sports team
with the most amazing seats in the house.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.807
With my lovely wife.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.604
I was wondering
if you were gonna put that part in.

20:29.188 --> 20:31.982
They said I could join them.
It's not that late.

20:32.149 --> 20:36.236
You definitely could.
Or you could rip off the Band-Aid.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.823
Elevator buttons. Really?

20:40.824 --> 20:42.159
Someone's gotta make 'em.

20:42.242 --> 20:46.079
My grandfather realized that,
created a monopoly on the business.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.415
Probably because nobody else wanted to.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.501
Their loss, our millions.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.587
Why the FBI?

20:53.670 --> 20:54.671
You come from money.

20:54.755 --> 20:56.173
There are a lot of things
you could've done.

20:57.174 --> 21:01.011
I grew up knowing
bankers and stockbrokers, trust fund kids.

21:02.054 --> 21:04.765
Just got to a point where I realized
I was surrounded with criminals,

21:04.848 --> 21:07.518
only they wore suits
and had great lawyers.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.521
-So you decided to do something about it.
-Hmm.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.189
You could argue that

21:12.272 --> 21:14.274
the elevator button kid
never really fit in.

21:14.358 --> 21:16.735
-This is all petty revenge.
-(LAUGHS) Okay.

21:17.694 --> 21:20.697
I get bored easily.
I like to keep things interesting.

21:20.822 --> 21:24.493
Yep. It's a riot around here.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.829
We are sitting outside a museum
right now,

21:27.913 --> 21:30.290
and we're waiting for a guy
to steal a painting.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.875
Come on, tell me you don't love that.

21:32.251 --> 21:35.337
It was just a lot more exciting
when I was the guy doing the stealing.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.798
Yeah, that's why
I like being your handler, Neal.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.050
You're either gonna make my career
or you're gonna ruin it.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.510
There's no middle ground with you.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.720
And you find that exciting?

21:43.804 --> 21:45.597
Beats making buttons.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.312
NEAL: Hey!

21:52.479 --> 21:53.814
Eleven o'clock.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.941
What am I looking at,
besides a bad hairstyle?

21:56.024 --> 21:58.902
That guy's gone around the perimeter
two times now.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.529
DAVID: Could be
just a guy taking a stroll.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.657
Come on, how many guys you know
take a stroll with a bag that big?

22:03.991 --> 22:07.369
One that's big enough to carry
all the tools he'd need to break in?

22:07.452 --> 22:09.288
All right. I'll call it in.

22:09.371 --> 22:12.291
No, no, if I'm wrong,
we're gonna spook the real thief.

22:13.292 --> 22:15.544
All right. Let's approach him.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.672
Wait, no. One of us should stay here.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.966
In case it's a false alarm,
we can keep an eye out.

22:21.049 --> 22:23.260
Yeah, that's a good idea, Neal. Stay put.

22:30.309 --> 22:32.227
Eight minutes, Caffrey.

22:35.606 --> 22:38.233
-Ah! Did I miss anything?
-What are you...

23:02.090 --> 23:03.175
MOZZIE: Neal, where are you?

23:03.258 --> 23:05.594
You're supposed to be
in the museum by now.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.054
PETER: Nothing like a stakeout.

(PETER GRUNTING)

23:13.143 --> 23:14.853
You could've saved me a slice.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.980
Yeah, well, I didn't know you were coming.

23:17.064 --> 23:20.692
El went out with some of her friends.
Thought I'd check in.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.110
Where's Siegel?

23:22.194 --> 23:24.738
Uh, he just saw some movement,
so he went to go check it out.

23:24.821 --> 23:25.822
Oh.

23:26.281 --> 23:29.201
Well, I'll keep his seat warm
until he comes back.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.579
You shouldn't be here.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.749
Hughes used to join me
for a stakeout or two back in the day.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.544
It's not about whether you can be here.

23:40.796 --> 23:43.465
I'd figured you'd like one last stakeout
for old time's sake.

23:43.549 --> 23:45.425
Yeah, and then what, Peter?

23:45.509 --> 23:48.428
One last undercover job? One last case?

23:48.762 --> 23:50.430
It's always gonna be "one last" something
with you,

23:50.514 --> 23:53.600
but the truth is
this is not your life now.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.894
-Neal...
-You and I aren't partners anymore.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.816
And you wanted to go. You should just go.

24:07.197 --> 24:08.657
You're right.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.755
-Are the cameras off, Moz?
-MOZZIE: <i>Yeah.</i>

24:37.811 --> 24:39.188
Sir. Hey.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.567
-What's your problem?
-I need to see inside the bag.

24:54.578 --> 24:55.662
Keep going.

25:00.542 --> 25:01.877
Is something wrong, Officer?

25:01.960 --> 25:05.672
No, no, no. No, there's nothing wrong.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

25:08.217 --> 25:10.928

Siegel's heading back to his car.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.471
<i>You got kind of a late start.</i>

25:12.638 --> 25:14.806
I ran into a Peter-shaped problem.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.267
Well, you're gonna run into
a handcuff-shaped problem

25:17.351 --> 25:18.810
if you don't get back to the car soon.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.063
Keep Siegel occupied a little longer.

25:21.271 --> 25:24.983
There's only so many times
he's gonna chase a head of hair.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.068
Uh-oh.

25:27.736 --> 25:28.820
What's "uh-oh"?

25:28.904 --> 25:31.323
Zev's here.
Siegel's heading in his direction.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.325
All right, do not let Siegel
see him get into the museum

25:33.408 --> 25:34.743
or none of this works.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.245
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

25:36.328 --> 25:37.913
He'll recognize me from Little Star.

25:37.996 --> 25:40.374
If he sees my face,
then I'm going to the clink.

25:40.624 --> 25:41.959
Then don't let him see it.

25:57.558 --> 25:58.684
Zev's inside.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.562
Fortunately or unfortunately,
I've got Siegel.

26:01.645 --> 26:05.023
Lose him, Moz.
I need a couple more minutes.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.817
MOZZIE: <i>I'm not sure you'll have it.</i>

26:06.900 --> 26:09.987
<i>Like I said, Zev's good.</i>
<i>He'll make quick work with the security.</i>

26:32.718 --> 26:34.720
Neal, your new Suit can't make me.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.693

27:00.787 --> 27:01.872
It wasn't me.

27:01.955 --> 27:03.707
I thought you said he was good, Moz.

27:05.501 --> 27:09.922

-The alarm's going off. He must be inside.
-All right, let's go.

27:49.461 --> 27:50.504
What do we got?

27:51.463 --> 27:53.131
He escaped with the painting.

All right, Baker, report in.

How you doing, Sarah, Rachel?

28:05.894 --> 28:08.063
I ripped off the Band-Aid.

How's it feel?

28:11.066 --> 28:12.359
It smarts.

-But you're right. It's for the best.
-Hmm.

right under your noses.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.014
-There's no excuse, sir.
-We're gonna find him, Peter.

28:42.139 --> 28:44.016

28:45.267 --> 28:47.477
You have no evidence, no positive ID.

28:47.561 --> 28:51.190
You are lucky that I have something.
I spoke with museum security.

28:51.273 --> 28:54.484
There's a chance
that our thief didn't work alone.

28:54.651 --> 28:55.986
There may be an accomplice.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.696
Security clocked an employee

28:57.779 --> 29:00.365
using her ID badge
right before the robbery.

29:00.449 --> 29:04.036

we'll get to the bottom of this.

-Yeah, of course.

29:37.486 --> 29:39.738

-You two know each other?

-Did you know about this?
-It's news to me.

29:52.918 --> 29:54.211
When I heard
the museum might be a target,

29:54.294 --> 29:55.671
I did a little reconnaissance.

29:55.754 --> 29:58.173
You flirted with me. We talked about...

29:58.257 --> 30:00.843
A lot of things, I know,
and I'm sorry for the deception.

30:01.051 --> 30:03.387
But I needed to see
if it might be an inside job.

30:03.929 --> 30:06.723
Look, I had nothing to do with this.

30:08.016 --> 30:11.144
I believe you. But it doesn't look good.

I didn't even realize it was missing

30:20.279 --> 30:23.740
until these guys with badges
showed up at my apartment.

Did you encounter anyone
who might have stolen it?

30:51.810 --> 30:53.645
I showed up and distracted you

30:53.729 --> 30:55.647
when you should have been
watching the Gershon.

30:55.731 --> 30:57.316
-This is my fault.
-Peter...

on Siegel's record.

this is not your fault.

-No, I don't.

31:10.579 --> 31:12.414
I checked her out
when I went to go visit the museum.

31:12.497 --> 31:14.291
She has no real motivation to do it.

Just the bad luck
of catching the thief's eye.

31:16.335 --> 31:18.003
Yeah, looks like it.

Then we need to find out
who's really behind this.

31:27.930 --> 31:29.973
This is the second time
he's stolen something from me.

31:30.057 --> 31:31.934
Technically, we were trying to trap him.

31:32.017 --> 31:34.019
And he got away. That only makes it worse.

Yeah, there's that, too.

31:39.107 --> 31:41.860
On the upside,
you did steal the right chapter.

31:41.944 --> 31:46.114
And surprisingly, sometimes,
the reality surpasses imagination.

31:46.198 --> 31:48.283
-Any idea what it means?
-No clue yet.

31:48.367 --> 31:49.493
But I made us a copy,

so we'll be able to figure out
why Hagen wants it so badly.

31:52.621 --> 31:54.706
None of this matters
if they don't catch Zev.

31:54.790 --> 31:55.832
The longer he's out there,

31:55.916 --> 31:57.167
the closer
they're gonna look at the museum.

They might realize
there's more than just a painting missing.

32:00.170 --> 32:01.547
So solve the case.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.715
I did solve the case. I created the case.

No, no, you should have. I'm glad you did.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.178
All right,
I've just stolen this piece of art,

33:31.261 --> 33:32.304
and suddenly an alarm goes off.

You're sweating.

33:34.056 --> 33:37.351
Even though I'm a professional,
yeah, I'm scared.

33:37.935 --> 33:39.853

isn't that great here,

33:39.937 --> 33:41.813
but still, caged in.

PETER: The main security door

33:44.358 --> 33:47.694
fall roughly here.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.947
Peter, don't scuff up the floor
with your shoe.

33:50.030 --> 33:53.784
They've got machines to clean that.
You're caught. What now?

33:55.118 --> 33:57.538
I'd examine the security door
for a weakness.

33:58.789 --> 34:00.874
It's a Mark-X2 security door.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.001
If I've done my research,
I would know that.

34:03.085 --> 34:07.881
And I'd have tools with me for the art.
I'd use them to pry the panel open.

34:08.757 --> 34:10.843
And then I need to get to the wires
to short the circuit.

34:10.926 --> 34:11.969
What are you doing?

34:15.681 --> 34:17.516
I took my gloves off.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.352
Which means there might be prints.

34:21.019 --> 34:22.771
Unless you were smart enough to wipe it.

34:22.855 --> 34:24.481
No, there's adrenaline
rushing through my body.

-Sloppy work.

-You held to your word, Caffrey.
-What was that?

I got you a pizza. You got me a bad guy.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.960
Can we keep that arrangement going?

35:27.044 --> 35:29.296
You make it a dinner at Masa,
and we might have a deal.

35:29.671 --> 35:32.090
You and me,
we're two sides of the same coin, Caffrey.

35:32.174 --> 35:33.175
-You and me?
-Yeah.

35:33.258 --> 35:35.552
-How so?
-We're both self-made men.

35:35.636 --> 35:37.971
-Just in different ways.
-You came from millions.

35:38.055 --> 35:39.723
I did. And then I was disowned.

35:39.806 --> 35:41.725
See, arresting your family's friends
will do that.

35:42.059 --> 35:45.354
I guess that explains the,
um, phantom ring.

35:46.563 --> 35:48.023
Well, not exactly.

35:48.106 --> 35:51.109
She missed the life. I don't blame her.
She thought she was marrying a Siegel.

35:51.193 --> 35:53.320
She got Agent Siegel instead.

35:54.363 --> 35:57.783
You gave up all that
for long hours and little reward?

35:59.201 --> 36:00.661
Yeah, I did.

36:01.411 --> 36:03.455
You gave up
the exotic locales and exciting capers

36:03.539 --> 36:04.623
for the same thing, Neal.

36:04.706 --> 36:06.583
-I didn't have a choice.
-Oh, come on, Caffrey.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.877
We both know
you can ditch that anklet any time.

36:09.169 --> 36:10.921
If you really wanted to.

36:11.505 --> 36:13.549
I gotta ask you something, Caffrey.

36:14.716 --> 36:15.843
What?

36:18.053 --> 36:20.389
-Good work, you two.
-Peter, I read your report.

36:20.472 --> 36:22.432
Your name wasn't anywhere in there,
and it should've been.

36:22.516 --> 36:23.684
It was your case.

36:23.767 --> 36:27.229
I stepped into it,
and it was only fair that I stepped out.

36:27.312 --> 36:29.648
Either way, uh, I appreciate it.

36:31.108 --> 36:34.027
I look forward to
what you two bring me next.

36:39.950 --> 36:41.368
What were you gonna ask me?

36:43.370 --> 36:45.664
You want to get a drink? Celebrate?

36:45.998 --> 36:48.709
Ah, I can't tonight. Next time.

36:49.084 --> 36:51.086
Right. Next time.

36:51.420 --> 36:52.671
Good work today.

36:58.051 --> 36:59.678
NEAL: I made a mistake.

37:00.053 --> 37:03.015
We all make mistakes.
Including Zev, fortunately.

37:03.098 --> 37:04.808
You should have seen the look on his face.

37:04.892 --> 37:06.768
Yeah, it probably matched the one on mine.

37:06.852 --> 37:08.896
I took off my gloves, Moz.

37:09.104 --> 37:12.649
When the Navajos make a piece of art,
they always add a flaw.

37:12.733 --> 37:16.403
Only the great spirit is perfect.
Humanity should not try to be.

37:16.486 --> 37:18.614
That's a little grandiose,
don't you think?

37:18.739 --> 37:21.533
All I'm saying is
that we are mere mortals.

37:21.617 --> 37:22.993
We all make mistakes now and then.

37:23.076 --> 37:24.203
Lately, I've been making a lot of them,

37:24.286 --> 37:27.372
and I'm starting to think that
delivering this chapter is another one.

37:27.456 --> 37:30.709
Hagen is a forger.
If we gave him a fake, he'd know it.

37:30.792 --> 37:32.544
We need a game plan, Moz.

37:32.628 --> 37:34.671
In order for Hagen's plan to work,

37:34.755 --> 37:38.091
he had to give us access
to the chapter first.

37:38.300 --> 37:41.261
That was his mistake.
We'll use it to our advantage.

37:41.512 --> 37:44.640
We figure out what's hidden in those pages
and get to it first.

37:44.723 --> 37:48.936
You and me decoding a puzzle,
never bet against the house.

37:49.102 --> 37:52.356
Oh, by the way, I think
your mistake was that wig, MacGyver.

37:52.439 --> 37:53.440
Seriously?

37:53.524 --> 37:57.110
You're just jealous because for once,
people are staring at all of this

37:57.194 --> 37:58.904
instead of staring at all of that.

37:58.987 --> 38:00.280
Okay, they're staring, all right.

38:00.364 --> 38:03.325
Do you think if I find a paper clip,
some silly putty, and a rubber band,

38:03.408 --> 38:04.701
you could make me an 8-track player?

38:04.785 --> 38:07.246
-I could make a wine opener.
-That, I believe.

38:07.496 --> 38:10.249
Knockoff Suit has already seen my face.

38:10.332 --> 38:12.918
-Hagen doesn't need to.
-Thanks, Moz.

38:18.882 --> 38:20.884
CURTIS: You caused quite a ruckus.

38:22.302 --> 38:25.472
You got what you wanted.
That's all that matters.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.226
This is the real thing?

38:29.309 --> 38:32.354
-You know your forgeries. You tell me.
-I will.

38:32.563 --> 38:35.983
See, this relationship
is working wonderfully.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.860
When does it end, Hagen?

38:39.736 --> 38:43.323
I'm a fair man.
I won't hold this over your head forever.

38:43.490 --> 38:46.869
When I get what I want, I'll leave you be.

38:47.286 --> 38:49.788
NEAL: But you won't tell me what that is?

38:50.122 --> 38:53.000
Come on, Mr. Caffrey.
I know you love a mystery.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.626
Don't spoil it for yourself.

39:10.684 --> 39:12.311
NEAL: Shouldn't somebody else
be doing this?

39:12.394 --> 39:14.229
I mean, you're the acting SSA now.

39:14.313 --> 39:16.315
JONES: And returning
a multimillion-dollar piece of art

39:16.398 --> 39:18.483
is exactly what an acting SSA does.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.652
And it feels damn good doing it.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.654
What I don't get is why you're here.

39:22.738 --> 39:25.741
I mean, it's rare for someone like me
to be able to return something.

39:25.824 --> 39:28.452
I just thought I'd try it on for size.

39:30.579 --> 39:32.331
You could've told me it was about a girl.

39:32.414 --> 39:34.166
-Why can't it be both?
-Mmm-hmm.

39:34.708 --> 39:35.876
Hey.

39:36.710 --> 39:39.588
Hey. Neal, is it?

39:39.922 --> 39:43.050
I never lied about my name.
About anything, actually.

39:43.342 --> 39:45.594
-You sure did leave out a lot.
-I did.

39:46.428 --> 39:50.224
-I heard you were cleared.
-I was. Just in time to be fired.

39:50.516 --> 39:52.184
Why? The painting was returned.

39:52.267 --> 39:53.977
You had nothing to do with the theft
in the first place.

39:54.061 --> 39:55.896
From your lips to my boss's ears.

39:55.979 --> 39:58.815
But I'm the reason the thief got in, so...

39:59.233 --> 40:02.319
-Because they stole your key card.
-So I'm gone.

40:03.111 --> 40:05.113
It doesn't matter anyway.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.199
My hope was that
the owner would let us look at

40:07.282 --> 40:09.952
and study the codex, and now it's gone.

40:10.202 --> 40:11.537
I'm sorry.

40:12.162 --> 40:13.455
It's not your fault.

40:18.085 --> 40:19.753
-See you.
-See you.

40:29.638 --> 40:30.931
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

41:01.128 --> 41:02.546
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

41:13.891 --> 41:16.768
Initial report is a mugging gone wrong.

41:17.728 --> 41:19.646
No witnesses in the area.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.191
We're not sure why he was here.

41:22.316 --> 41:26.153
-Think he was looking for an apartment?
-NEAL: He was, but not here.
