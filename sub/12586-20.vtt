WEBVTT

00:32.198 --> 00:34.159
-Yep.
Yep.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.994
-Mm-hm.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.370
Yep, I'm happy.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.707
I just found out
the Texas Propane Commission

00:40.790 --> 00:43.460
is giving me another Blue Flame of Valor.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.086
-Top drawer!
Hey, all right!

00:45.170 --> 00:46.212
Way to dang ol' go, man.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.797
I wish I worked for someone

00:47.881 --> 00:49.924
who'd hand out an award
every now and then.

00:50.008 --> 00:55.013
-But, no, I work for the army.
Yes, this is indeed a banner day.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.599
I've just come up
with a new get rich quick scheme.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.435
I going to apply to be a waiter
at Bazooms!

01:00.518 --> 01:03.354
But all the waiters at Bazooms
are waitresses.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.566
Yes, they are ladies, whereas I am a man.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.860
And a flat-chested one at that.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.779
So Bazooms won't hire me.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.115
And when they don't,
I'll sue for sex discrimination.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.784
It's a brilliant idea.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.953
Dang it, Dale.
Did you ever get the brilliant idea

01:19.037 --> 01:21.873
to make money through dedication
and hard work?

01:21.956 --> 01:23.708
Yep. Dismissed it.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.001
-

01:29.631 --> 01:33.760
I can't wait until I'm doing this
with beer cans.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.392
Why do we need a policeman at school?

01:41.476 --> 01:46.481
Yeah, it's like they took something sucky
and made it even suckier.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.027
Aw!

01:58.743 --> 02:03.665
Um, I know this looks bad,
but I didn't throw that can.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.127
Principal Moss,
this young man threw a can at me.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.253
Aw, shoot.

02:09.087 --> 02:13.716
But I didn't. Clark Peters threw the can.
He and Dooley set me up.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.052
Bobby, there's no excuse for this.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.639
Sure, Officer Brown maybe a disgraced cop
who tampered with evidence,

02:19.722 --> 02:22.600
got pulled off his beat and assigned
this nothing position,

02:22.684 --> 02:26.771
-but this here used to be a man.
-Yes, I was.

02:26.855 --> 02:31.025
All right, your punishment's going to be
to work alongside Officer Brown

02:31.109 --> 02:32.152
for the rest of the week.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.278
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:36.030 --> 02:40.160
It's not fair. I'm being punished
for something I didn't do.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.246
Well, you hang out with a bad crowd,
that's what happens.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.832
Maybe it won't be so bad.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.751
I'll finally get to pull rank
on the crossing guards.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.921
Watch out, Emily, I'm coming for you.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.427
Well, Peggy,
thanks for a delicious breakfast.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.180
If that's how the Belgians make
their waffles,

03:00.263 --> 03:02.348
then I haven't given them a fair shake.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.683
You are welcome.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.270
I wanted to do something special
in honor of your Blue Flame of Valor.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.607
And guess what? I got you a present.

03:13.943 --> 03:17.697
The '77 Cowboys! Peggy, it's beautiful!

03:17.780 --> 03:19.324
And it's signed by the whole team.

03:19.407 --> 03:23.328
-Even the team doctor, or trainer.
-Lars Olsen!

03:23.411 --> 03:27.582
Roger Staubach, Golden Richards,
Tony Dorsett,

03:27.665 --> 03:30.752
Pat Donov... what the heck?

03:30.835 --> 03:33.213
This isn't how Pat Donovan signs his name.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.633
-Who's Pat Donovan?
-He was our left tackle.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.470
Master of the pancake
block and the long, flowing signature.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.722
This is tight, little chicken scratch.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.724
-It's a fake!
-Are you sure?

03:44.807 --> 03:47.894
-Peggy.
-We need to return this forgery!

03:47.977 --> 03:50.396
Damn straight. Where did you get it?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.606
At Metrowalk.

03:51.689 --> 03:53.733
I hate that place.

03:53.816 --> 03:58.238
It's like a magnet for bums
and hooligans and young people.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.366
Come on, we're going to go there
and demand our money back.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.037
Oh, Hank, honey, you forgot your wallet.

04:09.332 --> 04:13.336
-So, you've never waited tables before?
-Nope.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.631
And you have no restaurant
experience of any kind?

04:16.714 --> 04:19.717
-Nuh-uh.
-And you're a man?

04:19.801 --> 04:22.929
Well, I don't know why that should matter,
but yes.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.062
Congratulations, you got the job.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.231
Do what now?

04:36.901 --> 04:41.406
Look at this place. It's like hell.
Or Dallas.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.615
What the?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.951
It appears we are standing on a fountain.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.038
Got a dollar? Change?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.416
Look, I didn't mind when you gave me diet,

04:51.499 --> 04:55.545
and I was okay that you put cheese on this
even though I'm lactose intolerant.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.922
It's just... I know I gave you a 20.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.966
Can I at least have the right change?

05:01.050 --> 05:02.677
Someone's getting ripped off.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.846
How long have we been here, three minutes?

05:04.929 --> 05:06.723
They ought to burn this place down.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.391
Oh, Hank, here we are.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.185
Now, let's get our money back
and get the heck out of here...

05:11.269 --> 05:15.148
byway of Sephora. It's the only place
that still carries Charlie.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.653
Hey, buddy. What can I interest you in?

05:20.737 --> 05:24.615
We've got an autographed Pete Rose jersey,
an autographed Pete Rose rookie card,

05:24.699 --> 05:27.118
an autographed Pete Rose autograph.

05:27.201 --> 05:30.788
That's right, it's his signature
within his signature.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.791
I don't want to buy anything.
I'm here to make a return.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.794
That is not Pat Donovan's signature.

05:36.878 --> 05:37.837
Sure it is.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.506
Hey, Leo, isn't this how
Pat Donovan signs his name?

05:40.590 --> 05:41.716
Yep. Told ya.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.386
And here,
I've got a certificate of authenticity.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.597
It's signed by Paul Johnson.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.183
I don't care who the heck it's signed by.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.144
This is a fake and I want
my got-dang money back.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.647
-Sorry, all sales are final.
-Well, that just tears it.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.940
Come on, Peggy.

05:58.024 --> 06:02.820
Let's get out of here before I leave
Thom McCann's autograph on this guy's ass.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.911
Bobby Hill, reporting for duty.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.829
Fine. Have a seat.

06:16.709 --> 06:20.004
So, when do we get to round up some perps?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.172
We don't.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.842
Sure, I used to shoot people
and see dead bodies and stuff,

06:24.926 --> 06:26.928
but those were happier times.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.849
Wait a second! Truancy is a school issue.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.812
And I know for a fact that
Dooley and Clark Peters

06:35.895 --> 06:38.022
skipped class to hang out at Whattaburger.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.732
They're there right now.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.527
Come on, let's go catch us some truants!

06:43.152 --> 06:44.112
Whatever.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.992
I'm fed up with it. Everywhere you turn,
someone's trying to rip you off.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.579
And it's not just the guys
with the tattoos anymore.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.123
It's a disgrace.

06:56.874 --> 07:00.420
Oh, that little puppy wind-up toy
is so cute!

07:00.503 --> 07:02.171
You see... oh, it just jumped!

07:02.255 --> 07:04.382
I gotta... I'll be back in just a minute.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.393
Hey! Hey, you! Get back here!

07:15.476 --> 07:18.479
-Give me that wallet!
-Okay, okay.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.565
I ought to tear your head off.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.899
Yeah, you better run.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.651
What happened?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.237
A thief just tried to walk off
with my wallet.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.655
Really?

07:27.738 --> 07:30.575
-But wait, I have your wallet in my purse.
-What?

07:30.658 --> 07:33.578
You left the house in such a hurry,
you forgot to take it.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.001
Oh, my God, Peggy. I'm a mugger!

07:46.674 --> 07:49.427
They cannot pin this on you.
It's not your fault

07:49.510 --> 07:51.345
that all men's wallets look the same.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.223
Now maybe we can reopen
the fanny pack discussion?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.226
-No.
-Fine. Why don't we just go back

07:57.310 --> 07:59.270
and turn the wallet in to mall security?

07:59.353 --> 08:01.856
Peggy, security guards aren't real cops.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.692
They don't have
the same high ethical standards.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.236
They'd have kept all the money,
and I'd take the heat.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.989
Well, then you need to return it yourself.

08:10.072 --> 08:13.117
Just open up the wallet
and find some identification.

08:13.201 --> 08:17.288
It just seems wrong.
A man's wallet is a very personal thing.

08:17.371 --> 08:21.626
-It's like money filled underwear.
-You have no choice, Hank.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.091
Okay, here's the guy's ID.

08:29.175 --> 08:33.804
"Barry Rollins,
2015 Ridge Street, McMaynerbury."

08:33.888 --> 08:36.766
He's not an organ donor.
Probably a drinker.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.896
He was a white man, about 40.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.357
-What's his name?
-What? I don't know.

08:44.440 --> 08:48.569
Huh. Did you get a picture of him?
A confession, something?

08:48.653 --> 08:49.654
No!

08:49.737 --> 08:50.821
Huh...

08:50.905 --> 08:52.406
Okay, be safe now.

08:52.907 --> 08:53.950
Wha... Please!

08:54.033 --> 08:55.910
I'm tired of being a victim!

09:07.255 --> 09:08.839
<i>Uh. Hi, this is Hank.</i>

09:08.923 --> 09:12.051
<i>Just Hank. Let's leave it at that.</i>

09:12.134 --> 09:16.264
<i>I have your wallet,</i>
<i>and I've got your address.</i>

09:16.347 --> 09:19.934
<i>Don't go to the police.</i>
<i>Let's just you and me settle this.</i>

09:20.017 --> 09:21.519
<i>I'll be seeing you.</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:24.522
You messed with the wrong guy.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.816
In fact, you made me the wrong guy.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.318
Forty-two years of being picked
on ends today.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.573
Well, we're almost at Whattaburger.

09:33.656 --> 09:38.327
Boy, will Dooley and Clark Peters
ever be surprised to see us!

09:38.411 --> 09:40.037
Yeah. You know, Bobby,

09:40.121 --> 09:42.832
it's been awhile
since I've driven to a crime scene.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.502
And sure, truancy is no homicide
or armed robbery

09:46.586 --> 09:50.923
or public urination, but it still feels
good to hit the streets.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.304
So, can we use this?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.557
Yeah, what the hell.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.355
Here we go!

10:08.816 --> 10:11.777
You got them, Officer Brown!

10:11.861 --> 10:14.989
You set up the wrong guy, boyos!

10:15.072 --> 10:18.784
I tell ya, Bobby,
it's just nice to nab some suspects.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.454
I'm a suspect.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.874
That dang Barry Rollins.

10:24.957 --> 10:29.128
I know if someone inadvertently robbed me,
I'd at least give 'em the courtesy

10:29.211 --> 10:30.796
of a return phone call.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.133
Hank, why don't you just admit
you meant to steal the wallet?

10:34.216 --> 10:36.385
It's okay... sometimes I take things.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.766
Uh, where's the light beer?

10:41.849 --> 10:43.976
I've got to fit into a uniform, people.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.228
I can't believe you took the job.

10:46.312 --> 10:50.441
I had to... they only offered me the job
because they thought I wouldn't take it.

10:50.524 --> 10:54.904
They were calling my bluff...
now I'm calling their bluff.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.531
It's a classic double-bluff-reverseo.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.576
Wow, there's even a name for it.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.287
When they see I'm not quitting,
they'll have to fire me.

11:03.371 --> 11:08.125
And when they do... sha-sha!
I sue for sex discrimination.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.627
You're an evil genius.

11:09.710 --> 11:13.798
Yep, the only downside is,
the other waitresses really resent me.

11:13.881 --> 11:19.220
See, I'm a lousy waiter who, unlike them,
is not constantly sexually harassed

11:19.303 --> 11:20.429
by the customers.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.973
You're talking nonsense, Barry, I...

11:23.057 --> 11:26.352
Did I just call you Barry?
I can't get him out of my head.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.062
I gotta go call him again.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.947
Pushed too far.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.783
Pushed too far.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.785
<i>Uh... Hi.</i>

11:42.868 --> 11:44.662
<i>It's Hank. Remember me?</i>

11:44.745 --> 11:47.998
<i>Look, since you keep dodging me,</i>
<i>you've left me no choice.</i>

11:48.082 --> 11:52.128
<i>I'm coming over,
and we'll settle</i><i>this face-to-face.</i>

11:52.211 --> 11:55.548
Yeah, face-to-face with these!

12:00.553 --> 12:01.929
Order 59 is up!

12:03.097 --> 12:05.266
Thank you, Pedro.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.435
I can't believe you got this job.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.687
My girlfriend wasn't hired because of you.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.274
And she's a great waitress
with a very expensive body.

12:13.357 --> 12:17.987
Are you suggesting that I shouldn't work
here because of my gender?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.656
I like the way you think, girlfriend!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.616
Would you be willing
to put that in writing?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.034
In the manager's writing?

12:38.257 --> 12:42.553
Hold on, honey.
Let me clear off a place for you to sit.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.853
There you are, my man.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.272
Hey, who do you like in
the Mavericks game tonight?

12:53.355 --> 12:55.941
I like the Mavs...
they're good in the post,

12:56.025 --> 12:58.027
and their perimeter game
has really been clicking.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.070
Well, amen to that, brother!

13:00.446 --> 13:02.615
Here's your tip from table four.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.535
Wow, I'm getting bigger tips
than the attractive,

13:06.619 --> 13:09.079
competent women just because I'm a man.

13:09.163 --> 13:12.958
Amen to that, brother! Woo! Oh, yeah!

13:14.960 --> 13:17.171
So this is where Barry Rollins lives.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.757
Mm... I hate showing up empty-handed.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.385
-We really should've brought wine.
-Let's just get this over with.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.639
<i>A man can only bend so far.</i>

13:26.722 --> 13:28.933
<i>Sooner or later, he breaks.</i>

13:29.016 --> 13:31.352
<i>Do you know the sound of a man breaking?</i>

13:31.435 --> 13:33.020
<i>Do you? Do you?</i>

13:34.230 --> 13:36.774
<i>That's the sound.</i>

13:42.446 --> 13:43.572
You fool.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.243
The fat guy and the fairly good-looking
guy can't save you.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.334
I'd swear I heard someone in there.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.882
Well, I guess nobody's home.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.218
Dang it, I just want to
leave the wallet for him.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.594
Maybe his door is unlocked.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.561
Huh, I wonder
if it'll fit in the mail slot?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.564
What the?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.026
Want to come in... for a beer?

14:26.574 --> 14:29.493
Hey, buddy, I'm just trying
to give your wallet back.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.954
My name is Barry Rollins,

14:32.037 --> 14:34.206
and I demand respect!

14:52.641 --> 14:54.685
Talkin' bout ol' dang ol' freakin' out
like that, man.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.105
What do we do?
I don't want him to follow me home.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.150
Bazooms!
Dale will believe us. He can help us.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.986
Well, Bazooms is a public place.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.488
We can go there and figure out
what we should do next.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.162
I'm glad you talked me into
taking out the ol' squad car.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.124
Those truants are gonna soil themselves
when they see this baby coming.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.542
Yeah.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.753
Hey, that's my dad's truck.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.296
He ran a red light.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.673
Something's wrong. He's speeding!

15:24.757 --> 15:26.008
Huh!

15:26.091 --> 15:27.843
Somebody's after my dad.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.138
Oh, my God, it's a high-speed chase.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.890
We've got to pursue.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.229
He's gaining on us, Hank.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.654
There's Bazooms!

16:10.260 --> 16:12.805
Hey, guys. Sit in my section.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.474
How about some hot wings, on the house?

16:15.557 --> 16:18.310
I find if I bring people things
and don't ring them up,

16:18.394 --> 16:20.604
-the tips are incredible.
-No, Dale, we...

16:21.981 --> 16:23.357
Oh, God. Oh, no!

16:35.119 --> 16:38.372
We're gonna be all right.
We're gonna be all right.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.457
Aah.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.711
-Dale, he's here?
-What? Who's here?

16:43.794 --> 16:46.255
The wallet guy.
I don't know what happened.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.216
We tried to give him his wallet back,
and he went crazy.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.390
-What do we do?
-I'll figure this out.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.643
Okay. Do you have darts tipped
with poison?

17:00.936 --> 17:03.981
-Darts tipped with anything?
-No.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.651
Well, you're not giving me much to work
with, but I'll come up with something.

17:09.903 --> 17:13.407
Wait. You missed the entrance.
That's where they went in.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.160
Sorry, Bobby, it's been a longtime.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.120
I didn't want the chase to end.

17:18.203 --> 17:22.541
And now I get to do an abrupt U-turn
across four lanes of traffic.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.711
Yahoo!

17:28.547 --> 17:30.215
Come here.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.216
Hey, man.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.468
Who's he gonna get?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.969
The kids were in the way.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.972
-I don't know, I couldn't see it.
-Well, let's ask him to do it again.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.058
We're not gonna ask him to do it again.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.225
I've got a plan.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.228
Okay, I'm letting you know now,
Bill, it involves running.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.648
Oh, and you might want to
leave your tip now.

17:48.567 --> 17:52.071
Okay, ladies, there's a birthday
at table six.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.991
Wow. I didn't think it was possible,
but you just got me to like you even less.

17:56.075 --> 18:00.621
But, um, you don't understand.
This guy's really rich.

18:00.704 --> 18:05.000
He'll be throwing money everywhere.
He's gonna make it rain.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.171
-Well, it is the man's birthday.
-He deserves a song.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.673
Okay, let's do this.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.633
Uh...

18:12.716 --> 18:14.259
Well, no, Bobby.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.011
I'm gonna go in by myself.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.847
-What? Why?
-You're only 13.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.141
If something were to happen to you,

18:21.225 --> 18:24.520
I'd never forgive myself for the damage
to my reputation.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.533
Hey, we've got a birthday!

18:38.867 --> 18:41.203
DALE and WAITRESSES:
<i>♪ It's your birthday. Yes, it is ♪</i>

18:41.286 --> 18:43.080
<i>♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>

18:43.163 --> 18:45.332
<i>♪ It's your birthday. Yes, it is ♪</i>

18:45.415 --> 18:47.501
<i>♪ Happy birthday, you... ♪</i>

18:47.584 --> 18:49.169
Get out of my way.

19:02.891 --> 19:06.145
Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.899
Hey, you can't do that.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.570
Do you know how tired we are
of pervs like you always touching us.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.990
Yeah, keep your sick hands off of him.
He's one of us.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.450
I'm one of you?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.744
You don't know how much that means to me.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.830
You make me sick.

19:24.913 --> 19:28.709
I'm not trying to harass anyone.
I just want to kill those guys.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.635
Drop your weapon!

19:40.304 --> 19:42.890
Thank God. See, I don't have my gun.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.811
You're under arrest for...

19:47.895 --> 19:50.939
...I don't know. I'm sure
there's something that covers this.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.401
No, no, no. I'm the victim here.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.279
Officer, wait. This belongs to him.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.989
Uh... Everything's in there.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.950
You know, I never meant
to take your wallet.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.744
It was just a misunderstanding.

20:03.827 --> 20:07.331
I hope some day you'll be able to look
back on this and laugh.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.335
Anyway, uh, I'm sorry.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.505
-Are you pressing charges?
-Hell, yeah.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.426
I got him, Bobby! I got him!

20:19.509 --> 20:21.803
All right! Hi, Dad.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.183
So, I think you know why I'm here.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.393
I've been assaulted in the line of duty.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.854
As a result, I plan to sue Bazooms

20:30.938 --> 20:33.857
for creating a hostile
and unsafe work environment

20:33.941 --> 20:36.526
for myself and my fellow waitresses.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.530
What do you want?

20:44.868 --> 20:46.620
It just says "money."

20:46.703 --> 20:48.372
We'll accept nothing less.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.123
That's gonna work for all the ladies,

20:50.207 --> 20:53.210
-but you will get nothing.
-What?

20:53.293 --> 20:56.546
You've been giving out appetizers
and desserts without ringing them up.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.800
Bazooms looks down on employee theft.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.595
Well, while you were looking down
on employee theft,

21:03.679 --> 21:06.056
you were also looking down my shirt.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.724
Shall we just call it even?

21:10.310 --> 21:11.645
Get him, girls!

21:53.979 --> 21:56.440
-<i>Maybe we could reopen</i>
<i>the fanny pack discussion?</i>

21:56.523 --> 21:57.649
-<i>No</i>.
