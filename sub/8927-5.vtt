WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:09.375
When my father arrives,
I would like to propose to him

00:09.376 --> 00:11.544
that we don't hang the pirates
but we pardon them.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.630
Any man who proposes to pardon
a traitor is himself a traitor.

00:14.631 --> 00:18.300
I find his argument persuasive
and I find yours wanting, sir.

00:18.301 --> 00:20.603
You're so close to having
everything you've wanted.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.021
I came to help you get it.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.390
I hear that one of the thieves
assaulted another.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.642
It was all in service
of stealing a young girl

00:26.643 --> 00:28.360
intended to be ransomed to her father.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.279
Her name was Abigail Ashe.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.032
Lieutenant McGraw, my good
friend Lord Peter Ashe.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.035
Mr. Featherstone will announce
to his shipmates tomorrow

00:36.036 --> 00:39.455
that he has joined a new crew.
Your crew.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.207
He can't be on the ship right now.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.243
It could spoil whatever chances
we have to retrieve the Urca gold.

00:44.244 --> 00:47.246
I am fully committed to the removal
of Captain Vane from that fort.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.632
You are talking about rendering Nassau
completely unprotected.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.051
- I know.
- What say you, Captain?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.835
Fire.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.234 --> 03:23.568
It would appear we lost track of time.

03:42.922 --> 03:45.006
- Fire!
- Fire!

03:48.645 --> 03:50.845
Take cover!

04:04.411 --> 04:05.716
Please.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.364
Please, stop.

04:08.365 --> 04:11.250
Surely you must realize
this is a fruitless errand.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.585
The time for conciliation is well past.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.537
I must try.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.208
Why?

04:19.209 --> 04:21.625
I'm the only one
who can stop him, Pastor.

04:23.729 --> 04:26.014
I'm the only one who
knows why he's doing it.

04:56.407 --> 04:58.489
__

05:09.225 --> 05:11.810
Your father said he would never
let your proposal come to a vote.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.345
I do believe he meant it.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.931
Tell me what chance this has of success.
Be honest.

05:15.932 --> 05:18.600
Ultimately there is tremendous support
for every part of the package.

05:18.601 --> 05:21.320
This entire battle is being waged
over the pardon provision.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.072
Without it, I could get this
passed in a matter of hours.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.574
The rest of it is meaningless
without the pardons.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.025
They're the only hope
for redeeming Nassau.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.778
I know, which is why
we'll keep on fighting.

05:29.779 --> 05:32.531
I know your father
is a formidable adversary.

05:32.532 --> 05:33.915
So am I.

05:38.788 --> 05:40.756
What is it?

05:40.757 --> 05:42.173
A moment please?

05:48.381 --> 05:50.632
I'm going to make arrangements
to leave for the country.

05:50.633 --> 05:53.719
Leave? Leave when?

05:53.720 --> 05:55.687
Now.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.524
- Tonight.
- May I ask why?

05:58.525 --> 06:01.143
This fight with your father.

06:01.144 --> 06:04.113
The more public it gets,
the more visible it gets,

06:04.114 --> 06:05.647
the greater the liability
I will be for you.

06:05.648 --> 06:07.533
Liability? How could you possibly...

06:07.534 --> 06:10.619
The lieutenant's ship
arrived this morning.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.287
Returned from the Bahama Islands.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.326
I received word not long ago.

06:17.327 --> 06:19.828
The rumors about me and
my relationship with him

06:19.829 --> 06:21.880
have gone quiet the past
few months he's been away

06:21.881 --> 06:24.299
and I'm concerned that when he returns

06:24.300 --> 06:25.884
people will start whispering again.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.336
Let them whisper.

06:27.337 --> 06:30.055
It's not the rumors that concern me.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.474
It's the scrutiny that follows that.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.177
And what that scrutiny might unearth.

06:35.178 --> 06:37.679
So someone might discover
you and he shared a bed.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.732
I'm concerned they might dig past that

06:40.733 --> 06:43.101
and discover something

06:43.102 --> 06:45.904
far more damaging

06:45.905 --> 06:47.572
than that.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.535
I can assure you, Mr. Gates' death

06:59.536 --> 07:01.503
is not one the captain took lightly.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.705
When I arrived

07:03.706 --> 07:07.259
just after the deed was done,

07:07.260 --> 07:09.511
I saw the look on his face.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.681
The pain it caused him
to do what he did.

07:15.051 --> 07:16.969
But in that moment,
he believed it necessary

07:16.970 --> 07:19.103
to preserve the hunt
for the Urca and her gold.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.392
Flint killed him?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.981
Yes.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.402
And he's still captain?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.706
How?

07:37.707 --> 07:39.458
After a brief interlude,

07:39.459 --> 07:42.461
the men saw what I am hoping
you will see.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.796
That with the gold still
sitting on that beach,

07:44.797 --> 07:48.083
he represents our best, perhaps
our only chance of retrieving it.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.302
Once this business with Vane
and the fort is over,

07:50.303 --> 07:52.170
that is what the rest of us intend.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.255
Rest of us?

07:55.758 --> 07:57.259
That's why I'm here.

07:57.260 --> 07:59.228
You didn't want me with the men.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.064
You're worried I'll challenge Flint.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.816
Well, the thought crossed my mind.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.102
But I'm hoping

08:07.103 --> 08:10.239
that once you have a moment
to process all of this,

08:10.240 --> 08:13.325
you'll remember that you are
the same man

08:13.326 --> 08:17.195
who when handed a blank page pulled
from Mr. Singleton's corpse,

08:17.196 --> 08:21.083
stood by the captain for the
sake of the bigger picture.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.751
Then you'll realize you were right then.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.203
And the same kind of perspective
is what's called for now.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.254
Enough!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.959
I'm going to see my brothers now.

08:39.635 --> 08:44.106
Until I know what you're
going to say to the men,

08:44.107 --> 08:46.807
I can't let you say anything to the men.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.355
He returns at last. It's good
to have you back, Lieutenant.

09:33.356 --> 09:35.690
- Sir.
- Welcome home.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.912
Three months.

09:43.366 --> 09:45.474
Feels like twice as long.

09:46.816 --> 09:49.037
Our campaign against
my father and Whitehall

09:49.038 --> 09:51.707
has reached a most critical stage.

09:51.708 --> 09:55.711
If you were able to secure the support
of the royal governor in Nassau,

09:55.712 --> 09:58.263
it might just be the thing that
turns the tide in our favor.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.047
There is no governor in Nassau.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.050
What do you mean?

10:04.637 --> 10:07.606
I understand the dispute
arose over a bribe.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.225
Money that Governor
Thompson felt he was owed

10:10.226 --> 10:12.444
by a particular pirate captain.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.946
That captain recruited others.

10:14.947 --> 10:18.900
They demanded the governor
leave the island at once.

10:18.901 --> 10:21.953
Thompson refused, at which point

10:21.954 --> 10:24.289
a dozen armed men broke into his home,

10:24.290 --> 10:27.242
dragged his wife and nine-year-old
son out into the street

10:27.243 --> 10:28.793
and slit their throats.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.556
They let him live, so I'm told,

10:41.557 --> 10:43.258
so he would tell the tale

10:43.259 --> 10:45.761
and so that there would be
no misunderstanding

10:45.762 --> 10:47.596
about who is running Nassau now.

10:47.597 --> 10:50.482
Stupid fuckers.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.769
By the time I left, men were
beginning to occupy the fort.

10:53.770 --> 10:55.854
Had I stayed another day, I'm not sure

10:55.855 --> 10:58.273
they would have let me
leave with my ship.

10:58.274 --> 11:00.158
But what is clear is this,

11:00.159 --> 11:03.411
right now, there's no law in Nassau.

11:10.286 --> 11:13.121
I'm trying to imagine
standing up before the lords

11:13.122 --> 11:15.540
and suggesting pardons
for these people.

11:15.541 --> 11:19.294
I'm having a difficult time of it.

11:19.295 --> 11:23.298
The men responsible for this
crime deserve to be punished.

11:23.299 --> 11:25.517
But we cannot, we must not

11:25.518 --> 11:29.104
allow their actions to condemn the rest.

11:29.105 --> 11:32.307
As a matter of political reality,

11:32.308 --> 11:33.892
our plan is dead.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.444
Not necessarily.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.862
Beg your pardon?

11:36.863 --> 11:40.065
The navy hasn't made its case yet.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.983
The navy isn't going to make a case.

11:41.984 --> 11:45.153
The navy will do whatever
Parliament tells it to do.

11:45.154 --> 11:47.656
We're in a time of war.
If the Sea Lords

11:47.657 --> 11:50.075
were to recommend a change of
strategy, who would ignore them?

11:50.076 --> 11:52.244
- The war has got nothing to do with it.
- Doesn't it?

11:52.245 --> 11:55.913
Isn't a lawless Nassau a weakness
that Spain could exploit?

11:59.168 --> 12:01.552
How would you do it?

12:01.887 --> 12:04.505
By offering our plan
directly to the Sea Lords.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.357
Making our case to them.

12:06.358 --> 12:09.143
- They'd hear you?
- Yes, I think they would.

12:09.664 --> 12:11.602
Ahem, Lieutenant.

12:12.582 --> 12:15.934
May I speak with you
in private, please?

12:15.935 --> 12:17.768
Now.

12:28.531 --> 12:31.867
It's clear to me now that what
lies ahead is the road to ruin.

12:31.868 --> 12:34.202
And I'm asking you
to stop this right now

12:34.203 --> 12:36.787
before we've all gone
too far to turn back.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.262
What do you see, lad?

12:44.263 --> 12:46.598
Leeward tower just lost
another 10 foot of her wall.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.050
The dust is still clearing.

12:59.061 --> 13:02.364
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no.

13:02.365 --> 13:05.400
It's quite good.

13:05.401 --> 13:08.620
But here's the thing...

13:08.621 --> 13:12.040
the crew's banner is a sacred thing.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.960
It must simultaneously strike fear

13:14.961 --> 13:17.329
in the hearts of hardened men

13:17.330 --> 13:21.249
while inspiring and unifying
all those who sail under it.

13:21.250 --> 13:25.136
It must be something
approaching perfection.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.223
Any idea what direction that might be?

13:28.224 --> 13:30.392
Darling, I think we'll
both know it when we see it.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.592
Don't you?

13:37.433 --> 13:39.434
Charlotte.

13:39.435 --> 13:41.602
Oh.

13:44.941 --> 13:49.109
Never sailed with a captain
this particular before.

13:50.947 --> 13:53.081
We all have the same swords out there.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.699
We all have the same guns.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.502
But great art...

13:57.503 --> 13:59.421
has felled empires

13:59.422 --> 14:01.289
and therein lies all the difference.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.758
I don't understand what that means.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.127
No, but I do. So not to worry.

14:06.128 --> 14:09.014
While the rest of this island
sits about gawking

14:09.015 --> 14:11.933
at the chaos of the day
contemplating the end of the world,

14:11.934 --> 14:13.718
we would do well to use
this time to prepare.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.971
I'd like to be first men back in
the water when the smoke clears

14:15.972 --> 14:17.856
with every detail accounted for.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.192
Well, while we're on it,
we still got details to sort

14:21.193 --> 14:23.144
of a much bigger size than all that.

14:23.145 --> 14:25.680
Stores ain't procured,
articles ain't signed.

14:25.681 --> 14:27.795
I've seen the draft articles.
I'm fine with them as is.

14:27.796 --> 14:29.276
But the men ain't.

14:29.277 --> 14:31.620
They got some changes
you and I ought to discuss.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.571
Ooh, changes.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.656
Yes.

14:36.558 --> 14:38.376
You two making any progress?

14:38.377 --> 14:40.077
Slowly but surely.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.967
I'm sorry, you were saying
something about the articles.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.086
It can wait.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.137
That ain't letting up anytime soon.

14:52.174 --> 14:53.674
Excuse me.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.180
Fucking nightmare it must be up there.

14:59.181 --> 15:01.266
You think he's still in it?

15:01.267 --> 15:02.851
Who, Charles?

15:02.852 --> 15:04.853
He could get out of that
fort without being seen.

15:04.854 --> 15:07.155
He's stubborn but he ain't stupid.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.108
No, I'd say he's terribly stupid
when it comes to being stubborn.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.994
Given a choice between
capitulation and survival,

15:12.995 --> 15:15.497
I don't image that to be much
of a choice for him at all.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.698
He's in that fort, I assure you.

15:16.699 --> 15:19.200
You think he'll make it?

15:19.201 --> 15:21.953
I think Charles Vane
is something you and I survived.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.705
What happens to him now
is no longer of any concern to me.

15:28.844 --> 15:32.546
This morning, you and Max.

15:34.050 --> 15:38.386
You know what? I ain't got no right.

15:38.387 --> 15:40.855
We'll get through it.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.390
Always do, don't we?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.986
Steady.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.122
Stand.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.208
Ma'am. Ma'am, are you hurt?

16:00.209 --> 16:02.593
Help me.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.112
Walk on. Walk on.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.575
It's all right.
I see a way through this.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.412
A way towards the end
which we have all been seeking.

16:37.413 --> 16:41.049
Thomas, he sees only the principle.

16:41.050 --> 16:42.884
The right.

16:42.885 --> 16:44.919
It's inspiring.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.338
It can be intoxicating.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.674
It's why I love him.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.560
But you, you see the world as it is.

16:52.561 --> 16:54.896
You see its truths
and how to navigate them.

16:54.897 --> 16:56.681
How to bend them to your will.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.765
It's why I love you.

16:59.669 --> 17:02.203
Men like Thomas need men like you.

17:02.204 --> 17:03.872
To protect them from the world.

17:03.873 --> 17:05.790
And that is what I am asking you to do.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.959
The danger is simply too great.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.711
Anything that has ever
been worth doing

17:09.712 --> 17:12.380
has been worth doing in
the face of a little danger.

17:12.381 --> 17:15.215
I have been the subject of
enough ridicule and innuendo

17:15.217 --> 17:17.719
to know the difference between
a little danger and mortal danger,

17:17.720 --> 17:20.055
and I'm telling you that
what you and Thomas and I

17:20.056 --> 17:22.390
face right now is the latter.

17:22.391 --> 17:24.959
What's been going on in this
house isn't just some affair.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.729
No. No, it isn't.

17:27.730 --> 17:30.648
But since when did you care
what people think?

17:30.649 --> 17:32.317
This isn't a question of scandal.

17:32.318 --> 17:36.037
It isn't a state of mind.
They hang men for this.

17:36.038 --> 17:37.082
Don't be naive.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.373
When they have political motive,

17:38.374 --> 17:41.242
they use it as a pretense to hang men.

17:41.243 --> 17:44.245
Don't treat me like I'm someone else.
I know what London is, too.

17:44.246 --> 17:48.583
Alfred Hamilton does not
want those pardons issued.

17:48.584 --> 17:52.253
He has committed himself to doing
everything in his power to prevent it.

17:52.254 --> 17:54.973
And when he finds out what's
been going on in this house,

17:54.974 --> 17:56.257
he will use it to ruin us.

17:56.258 --> 17:59.310
Even if he were to find out,
he wouldn't use it against us.

17:59.311 --> 18:00.845
Now who's being naive?

18:00.846 --> 18:02.370
It would be just as
embarrassing for the earl

18:02.371 --> 18:03.515
as it would be for any of us.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.768
Do you really think he wants that?

18:06.769 --> 18:08.436
You are underestimating him.

18:08.437 --> 18:11.106
He will find a way to exploit it.

18:11.107 --> 18:14.159
Why take the risk?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.161
For the sake of the pirates of Nassau?

18:16.162 --> 18:18.862
Miranda, I saw it. I was there.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.117
Thomas was right about its promise.

18:22.118 --> 18:25.620
And once the pirate issue has abated,

18:25.621 --> 18:28.455
it'll need help to rebuild.
Help from people like us.

18:31.961 --> 18:34.295
You're suggesting we go there.

18:34.296 --> 18:36.965
A restored New Providence Island
will need a governor.

18:36.966 --> 18:39.467
Who better qualified
to oversee the building

18:39.468 --> 18:40.969
of the New World than Thomas?

18:40.970 --> 18:44.272
With these pardons, we can accomplish
that and leave London behind.

18:55.317 --> 18:57.651
I've known Admiral Hennessey
since I was a boy.

18:59.121 --> 19:02.123
He's the closest thing
I have to a father.

19:02.124 --> 19:03.908
Let me raise the plan with him.

19:03.909 --> 19:06.410
Seek his counsel.
There's no risk in that.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.000
This is too important not to try.

19:19.557 --> 19:21.608
Fire!

19:28.900 --> 19:30.734
- Reload the cannons.
- Reload! Reload!

19:30.735 --> 19:32.903
Quickly, boys, quickly.

19:32.904 --> 19:35.122
Let's go. Let's go.

19:35.123 --> 19:37.658
Two-six, heave!

19:37.659 --> 19:40.027
- Heave!
- Fire!

19:55.844 --> 19:58.396
- Two-six!
- Heave!

19:58.397 --> 19:59.863
Cease fire!

20:00.315 --> 20:02.099
Cease fire!

20:02.100 --> 20:05.068
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

20:06.522 --> 20:09.323
Prepare to move ashore.

20:09.324 --> 20:11.492
Ready the longboats.

20:57.739 --> 21:00.458
The courtyard wall's destroyed.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.493
A breach in the northwestern corridor.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.078
Seaward-facing batteries are gone

21:04.079 --> 21:05.997
as are most of the westward guns.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.582
How many did we lose?

21:07.583 --> 21:09.634
Seven.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.752
Another nine injured.

21:11.753 --> 21:14.388
How long do you expect?

21:14.389 --> 21:16.841
Before the men are massing
themselves on the beach

21:16.842 --> 21:18.091
to begin their assault?

21:19.428 --> 21:20.792
Two hours.

21:22.211 --> 21:24.644
Maybe less.

21:32.223 --> 21:34.975
Larson.

21:34.976 --> 21:37.311
Take her back to the cell.

21:37.312 --> 21:40.275
Make sure she remains
safe while I'm gone.

21:41.016 --> 21:44.902
No one is to touch her. Understood?

21:44.903 --> 21:45.936
Aye.

21:48.657 --> 21:51.359
While you're gone?
Where are you going?

21:51.360 --> 21:54.612
No matter how many of his men
we kill, he can find more.

21:54.613 --> 21:58.115
Eventually they breach

21:58.116 --> 22:00.501
and we die.

22:00.502 --> 22:02.036
So you're leaving?

22:02.037 --> 22:04.005
It's too great of a force to defeat

22:04.006 --> 22:06.174
if we attempt to fight the body of it.

22:06.175 --> 22:08.960
Only way to beat it

22:08.961 --> 22:11.178
is to cut off its head.

22:17.519 --> 22:19.720
I had the misfortune
of being in his presence

22:19.721 --> 22:22.557
when Mr. Underhill received
word of your proposal

22:22.558 --> 22:25.393
to form a partnership to sell
his goods on your ships.

22:25.394 --> 22:27.228
He said no.

22:27.229 --> 22:30.565
But it was the manner in which he
said no that is most promising.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.867
I don't understand what it
is he hopes to achieve by...

22:32.868 --> 22:35.570
His anger, I believe,
was due to the fact

22:35.571 --> 22:37.405
that he wanted to say yes.

22:37.406 --> 22:39.574
- Ma'am.
- What is it?

22:39.575 --> 22:41.542
Ma'am, an errant shot from the warship

22:41.543 --> 22:43.878
hit a set a stores outside the
southwest gates. Set it ablaze.

22:43.879 --> 22:45.630
How close to the Intrepid's
storehouse there?

22:45.631 --> 22:47.248
A few hundred yards, ma'am.

22:47.249 --> 22:49.300
The problem is it's been
freshly stocked with...

22:49.301 --> 22:52.837
With powder, I know.
Inform Mr. Lawrence

22:52.838 --> 22:55.340
he needs to move his powder stock
to my warehouse here immediately.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.976
And ask Virgil to take five men
to help put out that fire.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.146
- Any sign of capitulation?
- Ma'am?

23:01.147 --> 23:04.816
Captain Vane, has he made
any signal to surrender?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.818
No, ma'am.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.070
You're dismissed.

23:09.071 --> 23:11.906
What the fuck does that mean?
He wants to say yes.

23:11.907 --> 23:14.776
You desire legitimacy
in the eyes of London.

23:14.777 --> 23:17.028
But you cannot have it
until you find a way

23:17.029 --> 23:19.863
to ship something
other than stolen goods.

23:20.415 --> 23:23.618
The landowners want greater profits.

23:23.619 --> 23:26.087
But they cannot have them
until they find a way

23:26.088 --> 23:28.256
to ship their products
out of the port of Nassau

23:28.257 --> 23:32.460
free from the danger of the pirates.

23:32.461 --> 23:34.045
There is a partnership to be had here.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.013
I can broker it.

23:36.014 --> 23:39.016
And there is only one thing
standing in the way.

23:39.017 --> 23:41.769
If you were to appear
to divest yourself

23:41.770 --> 23:43.971
of your association with
the crews on account...

23:43.972 --> 23:45.890
You are unbelievable.

23:45.891 --> 23:47.942
All I'd have to do is give up the fence

23:47.943 --> 23:49.727
and you can make
all my dreams come true.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.313
You're a smart girl, Eleanor.

23:52.314 --> 23:54.782
And though I know
you're standing there,

23:54.783 --> 23:56.784
parsing this, trying to identify

23:56.785 --> 23:59.737
how my interests
diverge from yours here,

23:59.738 --> 24:01.739
I suspect you're not finding it.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.157
And it's because
it isn't there to be found.

24:13.698 --> 24:17.376
You want me to prove to Underhill
that I can be his partner?

24:18.423 --> 24:20.404
That I can be trustworthy?

24:20.676 --> 24:23.817
Then you have to prove the same to me.

24:24.062 --> 24:27.398
I have spent a lifetime exposed
to your self-serving lies.

24:27.399 --> 24:30.318
They're the manure
from which I sprouted.

24:30.319 --> 24:34.522
And if I can identify
the specific motive or not,

24:34.523 --> 24:38.692
I still come to expect that stench
anytime you darken my door.

24:58.881 --> 25:00.798
Find Mr. Silver for me, if you please.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.383
Captain.

25:02.384 --> 25:05.603
You've explained to your men
their responsibilities here?

25:05.604 --> 25:09.057
Aye, they know your plans to recover the
gold must be kept secret and silent.

25:09.058 --> 25:10.558
If it were to be discovered
by another crew,

25:10.559 --> 25:14.395
they could become competition
for its retrieval.

25:14.396 --> 25:16.898
You know how to keep a
secret between three men?

25:16.899 --> 25:17.981
Shoot two of them.

25:18.533 --> 25:22.052
What kind of fool tries to
keep a secret amongst 100?

25:22.053 --> 25:23.871
The faster we retake the fort,

25:23.872 --> 25:25.456
the faster you'll be back on the water

25:25.457 --> 25:27.625
en route to the Urca
with my men in your service.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.543
Even if the information
were to be divulged

25:29.544 --> 25:32.046
that the gold is still to be won,

25:32.047 --> 25:34.131
even if another crew could
discern its specific location,

25:34.132 --> 25:37.084
even if they could refit rapidly
enough to get out there ahead of you,

25:37.085 --> 25:39.920
they'd still be facing a warship
standing between them and their prize.

25:39.921 --> 25:43.340
Adhere to our plan,
you will have your gold

25:43.341 --> 25:45.392
and I'll have my fort.

25:58.704 --> 25:59.754
What are you doing here?

25:59.755 --> 26:02.423
I need to speak with you alone.

26:02.424 --> 26:03.758
You need to leave here right now.

26:03.759 --> 26:05.042
I will see you when I am able.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.948
I have come upon some information
which changes things for you.

26:07.949 --> 26:10.117
You must not move against that fort.

26:10.118 --> 26:12.586
Miranda, you don't
understand what's going on.

26:12.587 --> 26:15.790
I understand why you need that fort.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.842
I understand why you need that gold.

26:17.843 --> 26:19.460
I understand why you need this island.

26:19.461 --> 26:22.129
I understand it all because I was there

26:22.130 --> 26:24.799
the day our lives ended
and all of this began.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.886
But I have been devoted
to you since that day.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.638
I have been loyal

26:30.639 --> 26:33.057
and protective and fucking
committed to you since that day,

26:33.058 --> 26:35.643
and I am asking you to come with me

26:35.644 --> 26:38.445
so that I can save your life.

26:45.454 --> 26:47.655
There's an opportunity here today.

26:47.656 --> 26:50.207
An opportunity that may not
present itself again.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.242
If we act right now,

26:51.243 --> 26:55.379
we can prevent a catastrophic
loss to the Empire.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.581
We can make England stronger
tomorrow than she is today.

26:57.582 --> 26:59.416
We can save Nassau and all it takes

26:59.417 --> 27:03.220
is for us to do
a very reasonable thing.

27:03.221 --> 27:04.505
Military pardons?

27:04.506 --> 27:05.923
I know how it will be perceived, sir.

27:05.924 --> 27:10.261
I know how it looks for me to even
raise the subject with you here.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.264
But this is too important to be
deterred by dangers imagined.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.349
And if I have learned
anything from you,

27:15.350 --> 27:16.901
it is that it is moments like these

27:16.902 --> 27:20.020
that are the precise
measure of a man's courage.

27:20.021 --> 27:21.906
Good God.

27:21.907 --> 27:25.692
You perceive the danger
about this to be imagined.

27:28.147 --> 27:33.167
I told you when this began
to be careful of those people.

27:33.168 --> 27:35.536
To be aware of just how
sharp and unexpected

27:35.537 --> 27:38.588
the knife would be if you
discounted that danger.

27:40.809 --> 27:44.210
I'd thought you'd heard me, son.

27:49.801 --> 27:51.185
I heard you, sir.

27:51.186 --> 27:54.387
But I've come to see that you
and I were wrong about him.

27:54.789 --> 27:57.358
Lord Hamilton isn't someone
we should be wary of,

27:57.359 --> 28:00.360
he is exactly the kind of man
we should be listening to.

28:00.695 --> 28:02.112
On the day I was made an officer,

28:02.113 --> 28:05.032
you pulled me aside.

28:05.033 --> 28:08.986
You told me how proud you were of me.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.788
You told me that a measure of a man

28:10.789 --> 28:13.541
is in the moment when he is
confronted by himself.

28:13.542 --> 28:15.125
By opposing voices in his head,

28:15.126 --> 28:16.860
both arguing that they are
right, but one has to be wrong.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.164
To know the difference in that moment,
that is what makes an officer.

28:20.165 --> 28:22.333
What makes a man.

28:22.334 --> 28:27.171
Well, I see the difference here, sir.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.222
I know it.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.942
He arrived just before you did.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.110
And he told me what you did.

28:50.111 --> 28:52.863
After he invited you into his home,

28:52.864 --> 28:56.033
trusted you to assist
his son and daughter,

28:56.034 --> 28:58.851
and you flagrantly violated that trust.

28:58.852 --> 29:00.454
Sir, I don't know
what he told you, but...

29:00.455 --> 29:03.374
Yes, you do.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.292
I would like to defend you.

29:05.293 --> 29:08.712
I would like to remind myself
that every man has his flaws,

29:08.713 --> 29:12.299
his weaknesses that torment him.

29:12.300 --> 29:16.053
I would like to help you
recover from yours.

29:16.054 --> 29:18.689
But not this. It is too profane.

29:18.690 --> 29:22.943
It is too loathsome to be dismissed.

29:22.944 --> 29:24.812
This is your end.

29:24.813 --> 29:26.230
Sir, please let me explain.

29:26.231 --> 29:29.617
Be grateful it didn't happen
on the gallows.

29:29.618 --> 29:32.319
You thought I wouldn't
hear what you'd done?

29:32.320 --> 29:33.621
In my own house?

29:33.622 --> 29:37.657
That not even the faintest
whisper of it would reach me?

29:37.975 --> 29:42.729
Now, this ends quietly,

29:42.730 --> 29:44.480
permanently,

29:44.481 --> 29:47.316
and in the manner of my choosing.

29:48.492 --> 29:51.609
You are summarily
discharged from service.

29:51.911 --> 29:54.613
No charges will be drawn against you

29:54.614 --> 29:57.116
provided you leave London quietly

29:57.117 --> 30:00.201
and are neither seen
nor heard from again.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.768
If either the earl or I

30:03.769 --> 30:06.676
feel that this bargain
has been breached,

30:06.677 --> 30:11.276
the charges brought against you
will be swift and unyielding.

30:23.372 --> 30:25.323
Where's Thomas?

30:25.324 --> 30:28.993
They came. The earl's men.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.495
It happened quickly before I
could do anything to stop it.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.547
- They took him.
- Took him? Took him where?

30:36.335 --> 30:39.670
Bethlem Royal Hospital.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.839
He is to be committed there,

30:41.840 --> 30:44.008
owing to his uncontrollable grief

30:44.009 --> 30:47.011
over having learned
of my affair with you.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.939
- Our affair?
- That is what the story will be.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.565
I have been given until nightfall

30:53.811 --> 30:55.695
to vacate this house.

30:55.696 --> 30:58.817
And then you and I are to disappear.

30:59.583 --> 31:03.563
I have friends in
Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels.

31:03.564 --> 31:05.398
I can get you set up comfortably.

31:05.399 --> 31:08.901
Perhaps at some point, I can figure
out a way to get you back here.

31:08.902 --> 31:10.987
- I'm not leaving.
- James.

31:10.988 --> 31:12.738
- We're gonna get him out of there.
- We can't.

31:12.739 --> 31:14.907
- You watch me.
- You think you're angry about this?

31:14.908 --> 31:17.959
- I'm beyond that.
- I am enraged!

31:22.132 --> 31:24.297
He is my husband.

31:26.286 --> 31:29.337
Before they took him away,
he made me promise him...

31:31.508 --> 31:34.559
that no matter what happened
next, that you and I...

31:36.847 --> 31:40.666
would take care of each other.

31:41.268 --> 31:44.270
The danger here is real.

31:44.271 --> 31:46.689
Thomas is gone.

31:46.690 --> 31:49.741
And now you and I
must leave this place.

31:53.430 --> 31:54.947
We need to get you moving.

31:54.948 --> 31:57.450
When we get to the harbor,
I'll arrange passage for you.

31:57.451 --> 32:00.202
Anything you need that you don't
have, I'll see sent to you.

32:00.203 --> 32:02.321
In the meantime, my friends

32:02.322 --> 32:06.158
will ensure that you're taken care of.

32:06.159 --> 32:08.193
We won't be with your friends.

32:11.448 --> 32:12.915
We're not going to Paris.

32:12.916 --> 32:16.002
Or Brussels or Amsterdam.

32:16.003 --> 32:18.231
Then where are you going?

32:20.958 --> 32:22.618
Open the crate.

32:24.461 --> 32:27.462
Pass 'em down. Pass 'em down.

32:41.244 --> 32:43.245
Idelle said you were looking for me?

32:43.246 --> 32:45.581
To your knowledge,
have any of Flint's crew

32:45.582 --> 32:49.285
made their way up to the
brothel since coming ashore?

32:49.286 --> 32:51.319
Not that I'm aware of.

32:56.259 --> 32:57.460
Back from a lengthy journey

32:57.461 --> 33:01.897
and not one of them has
felt the need to have a go?

33:01.898 --> 33:03.482
Preparing for battle.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.901
Perhaps they have set
pleasure aside for the moment.

33:05.902 --> 33:10.740
Mmm, or maybe they was told to
stay the fuck away from here.

33:10.741 --> 33:13.775
To prevent them
from divulging a secret.

33:21.685 --> 33:24.570
- Charlotte.
- Don't.

33:24.571 --> 33:27.023
- What?
- You're crowding me.

33:27.024 --> 33:30.091
I understand this is very important
to you, but I can't work like this.

33:42.300 --> 33:45.724
You have regular custom with the men
of Captain Flint's crew, yes?

33:48.845 --> 33:51.347
It's all right.

33:51.348 --> 33:54.116
Just one.
He won't let the others near me.

33:54.117 --> 33:57.036
Has he paid you a visit yet
since his recent arrival?

33:57.037 --> 33:59.622
No, but he will.

33:59.623 --> 34:01.557
Can't stay away for long, that one.

34:01.558 --> 34:04.577
If or when he finally
decides to visit you,

34:04.578 --> 34:07.813
I'd like to know what he has
to say about the Urca gold.

34:07.814 --> 34:09.880
You haven't heard?

34:14.538 --> 34:16.739
Everyone's saying it wasn't there.

34:16.739 --> 34:19.975
They ran into a man of war instead,
managed to nick that ship.

34:19.976 --> 34:23.344
Yes, I know.
Just indulge me, will you?

34:23.346 --> 34:25.264
- Mr. Rackham.
- Mm.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.934
- A word.
- With me?

34:34.525 --> 34:36.505
Thank you, love.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.542
"Thank you, love?"

34:42.666 --> 34:45.768
- What's this?
- We need to talk about these articles.

34:45.768 --> 34:48.103
And I thought it best if we
could have the conversation

34:48.105 --> 34:50.155
just you and I.

34:59.366 --> 35:01.951
All right. What's the
matter with the articles?

35:01.952 --> 35:05.721
A few things.

35:05.722 --> 35:07.790
- Max...
- Let me stop you there.

35:07.791 --> 35:11.127
Yes, it's unorthodox to entitle a
woman to a share of the profits,

35:11.128 --> 35:13.479
but this is clearly a special case.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.364
That particular woman is a font

35:15.365 --> 35:17.700
of prostitutional intelligence.

35:17.701 --> 35:21.787
And believe me, if I could see
a way to replace her, I would.

35:21.788 --> 35:24.573
But at the moment, she is worth
far, far more to this crew

35:24.574 --> 35:26.158
than the share it costs to have her.

35:26.159 --> 35:29.328
I understand,
but you must understand

35:29.329 --> 35:32.381
that's not an easy thing
to sell men on a new ship

35:32.382 --> 35:34.133
used to a certain way of doing things.

35:34.134 --> 35:35.634
Are you saying you can't sell it?

35:35.635 --> 35:40.172
No, I might be able to with
a great deal of cajoling.

35:40.173 --> 35:42.391
The problem is Max's share

35:42.392 --> 35:44.425
ain't the only item
the men took issue with.

36:16.009 --> 36:17.960
Fuck's your problem?

36:17.961 --> 36:19.795
The crew have elected to set sail.

36:19.796 --> 36:20.880
Yeah?

36:20.881 --> 36:22.715
Small prize nearby.

36:22.716 --> 36:24.133
Probably not much by way of profit,

36:24.134 --> 36:28.186
but an easy prize to consummate
our new arrangement.

36:31.107 --> 36:34.109
That's good news, then, yeah?

36:34.861 --> 36:36.861
So again, fuck's your problem?

36:43.119 --> 36:44.570
There was a complication

36:44.571 --> 36:46.989
in the finalizing of the articles.

36:46.990 --> 36:49.241
Opposition from the men

36:49.242 --> 36:51.293
on two particular issues.

36:51.294 --> 36:54.914
Shit. I knew this was gonna happen.

36:54.915 --> 36:56.916
- It's the whore's share, ain't it?
- It is.

36:56.917 --> 37:00.085
Resistance to the idea of formalizing
her interest in writing.

37:00.086 --> 37:02.972
It's the second of the two
issues I find more troubling.

37:02.973 --> 37:05.925
- What's that?
- You.

37:05.926 --> 37:08.594
It would appear that while the
crew seems able to forgive

37:08.595 --> 37:10.396
or at least forget my part

37:10.397 --> 37:13.649
in the Mr. Hamund situation,

37:13.650 --> 37:16.101
they are aware that you were
the prime mover behind it

37:16.102 --> 37:20.189
and they are less willing to forgive it
or forget it in your case.

37:20.190 --> 37:23.242
They don't want me nor the whore?

37:23.243 --> 37:28.113
It was put to me that they will accept
one or the other, but not both.

37:28.114 --> 37:30.032
Fucking hell.

37:30.033 --> 37:31.834
How are we gonna get her
to keep turning out those leads

37:31.835 --> 37:34.869
when she finds out she ain't
getting her own share?

37:41.595 --> 37:42.867
What?

37:42.868 --> 37:45.644
It's only temporary.
Till I gain their trust.

37:45.645 --> 37:48.634
Sooner than later, I'll be able to
make the case to them directly.

37:48.635 --> 37:53.389
And you'll be back sailing with us
like this never happened.

37:53.390 --> 37:55.274
You chose her.

37:55.275 --> 37:57.142
They gave me a choice,
but it was no choice.

37:57.143 --> 37:58.527
Had I gone the other way,

37:58.528 --> 38:01.313
they'd be stewing about how I
value my relationship with you

38:01.314 --> 38:02.815
over securing their leads.

38:02.816 --> 38:05.484
It would have cost me their
trust and then the captaincy.

38:05.485 --> 38:07.620
Most assuredly soon there after.

38:07.621 --> 38:10.372
This is what is best for both
of us in the final analysis.

38:10.373 --> 38:12.491
We will sail at the head of this crew,

38:12.492 --> 38:15.878
it just requires this sacrifice
in the short term to ensure it.

38:15.879 --> 38:18.913
Anne? Anne?

38:27.589 --> 38:30.092
Perhaps it would help
if we went back to the beginning?

38:30.093 --> 38:31.677
You said you were
captured by the navy.

38:31.678 --> 38:33.846
You said you escaped their
custody, made your way back here,

38:33.847 --> 38:36.348
but you didn't mention the means
by which you managed that escape.

38:36.349 --> 38:38.517
- Why are you here?
- I beg your pardon?

38:38.518 --> 38:41.437
Why are you the one
here defending him?

38:41.438 --> 38:44.023
Oh, yes. I suppose it must
come as some surprise

38:44.024 --> 38:47.192
given the state of things
when last we saw each other.

38:47.193 --> 38:50.529
But it's become clear to me that a
crew requires two men to function.

38:50.530 --> 38:54.867
One to tell them what to do and another
to tell them why they should want to do it.

38:54.868 --> 38:58.704
In Mr. Gates' absence,
the latter role was unfilled.

38:58.705 --> 39:00.873
And I thought I could fill it.

39:00.874 --> 39:02.708
How the fuck did you manage that?

39:02.709 --> 39:06.595
I tried to tell you once,
I'm a hard man not to like.

39:06.596 --> 39:08.714
And at the end of the day,
and all else being equal,

39:08.715 --> 39:11.117
liked is just as good as feared.

39:13.603 --> 39:15.636
We like him.

39:19.225 --> 39:22.194
You thought Flint
killed both me and Gates

39:22.195 --> 39:25.114
and then you queued up to be
the next to fill the post.

39:25.115 --> 39:28.567
I don't know if you're either
very dangerous or very stupid.

39:28.568 --> 39:30.536
Possibly a bit of both.

39:30.537 --> 39:34.490
But I am certain I will avoid
the mistake you both made.

39:34.491 --> 39:37.659
I don't believe in him.

39:37.660 --> 39:41.380
To me, he is a means of
securing a very valuable prize.

39:41.381 --> 39:43.916
No more, no less.

39:43.917 --> 39:46.598
Which is why I need to know...

39:48.338 --> 39:50.923
when asked by the men,

39:50.924 --> 39:54.727
what will you tell them happened on
the bow of the Walrus that night?

39:54.728 --> 39:57.262
How did you end up in the water?

39:57.263 --> 40:00.314
You keep focusing on how I went in.

40:03.436 --> 40:06.487
Perhaps you should be more worried
about the thing that took me out.

40:09.275 --> 40:11.944
I can see how the men could've
been taken in by you...

40:11.945 --> 40:14.863
with what they've been through.

40:14.864 --> 40:16.665
But know this...

40:16.666 --> 40:18.867
had I been here,

40:18.868 --> 40:23.038
I doubt it would have been
this easy for you.

40:23.039 --> 40:27.292
Sooner or later, you need to release me.

40:27.293 --> 40:29.962
You have no choice.

40:29.963 --> 40:31.697
And the longer you delay,

40:31.698 --> 40:34.299
the more likely I might choose

40:34.300 --> 40:37.169
to take it personally.

40:37.170 --> 40:40.221
I would say I have some choice.

40:43.810 --> 40:48.730
Not while he's here you don't.

40:48.731 --> 40:50.765
We like him, too.

41:39.726 --> 41:42.734
You must understand, though
you perceive my actions in recent weeks

41:42.735 --> 41:45.404
to have been taken with little
regard for your welfare,

41:45.405 --> 41:47.656
the truth is exactly the opposite.

41:48.358 --> 41:50.943
All of my attempts to regain
control of this place

41:50.944 --> 41:52.744
have been with an eye
towards protecting you.

41:52.745 --> 41:55.080
You really have no idea
what this is about, do you?

41:55.081 --> 41:57.323
- Eleanor.
- You left me.

41:58.718 --> 42:01.686
After mother was killed in the
Rosario raid, you left me here.

42:04.140 --> 42:06.058
What kind of a reprehensible shit

42:06.059 --> 42:08.877
does something like that
to a little girl

42:08.878 --> 42:12.698
and then asks her to trust him again?

42:12.699 --> 42:14.566
Your mother's loss

42:14.567 --> 42:17.486
was almost unbearable to me.

42:17.487 --> 42:19.071
I must confess that in that moment,

42:19.072 --> 42:21.456
the only way I could think to carry on

42:21.457 --> 42:23.325
was to immerse myself in business.

42:23.326 --> 42:25.744
And to remove myself from this place.

42:25.745 --> 42:27.466
From her memory.

42:30.149 --> 42:33.368
And for that, I am sorry.

42:33.369 --> 42:35.105
Bullshit.

42:36.205 --> 42:38.183
It wasn't about Mother.

42:39.125 --> 42:41.028
It wasn't about an oversight.

42:43.413 --> 42:45.463
You left me here
because I wasn't your son.

42:52.772 --> 42:54.935
Yes.

42:57.443 --> 42:59.361
I was focused on the work

42:59.362 --> 43:01.830
and I saw no future in which a daughter

43:01.831 --> 43:04.865
would have a meaningful part in that.

43:07.870 --> 43:10.122
But, Eleanor,

43:10.123 --> 43:12.412
look how wrong I was.

43:13.593 --> 43:16.428
Look at what you've accomplished here.

43:16.429 --> 43:17.679
Pirate crews...

43:17.680 --> 43:21.383
repurposed as merchant
shippers and showing profits.

43:21.384 --> 43:24.019
You have proved the conceit possible.

43:24.020 --> 43:25.804
You are making real

43:25.805 --> 43:28.607
what was for decades a fantasy.

43:28.608 --> 43:31.393
The idea that this place
can be transformed,

43:31.394 --> 43:35.397
made profitable, redeemed from
within and on its own terms?

43:35.398 --> 43:39.368
You are doing this
without any help from me,

43:39.369 --> 43:42.821
nor from Whitehall, nor from
anyone in London at all.

43:42.822 --> 43:47.459
It is entirely of your own making.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.878
And it is miraculous.

43:49.879 --> 43:51.630
One day, years from now,

43:51.631 --> 43:53.548
someone in London will sit down,

43:53.549 --> 43:55.667
light his pipe and tell his children

43:55.668 --> 44:00.422
of the unlikely success story
that was Nassau.

44:00.423 --> 44:02.975
And he will say
it all began with a woman

44:02.976 --> 44:06.244
who decided to make it so.

44:06.679 --> 44:10.816
You have proven me so very wrong.

44:10.817 --> 44:14.047
And I could not be
prouder of you for it.

44:15.772 --> 44:18.690
Miss Guthrie? Miss Guthrie?

44:25.365 --> 44:28.416
I have Flint here. It would
be best if we could be alone.

44:30.870 --> 44:32.920
You can use the parlor upstairs.

44:43.049 --> 44:46.435
Everyone out.

44:46.436 --> 44:47.886
Now!

45:13.413 --> 45:15.163
While you were gone,

45:15.164 --> 45:16.615
Captain Vane and his men

45:16.616 --> 45:20.118
slaughtered another
pirate crew in the bay.

45:20.119 --> 45:22.921
There are whispers it was to avenge
an offense against Eleanor Guthrie.

45:22.922 --> 45:24.790
There are also whispers

45:24.791 --> 45:27.492
that it was to steal a hostage
being held by that crew.

45:27.493 --> 45:30.245
A girl who is now held in that fort.

45:30.246 --> 45:32.914
A girl who would be in harm's way
if you were to launch your attack.

45:32.915 --> 45:35.751
You pulled me away from my men
out of concern for a girl?

45:35.752 --> 45:38.753
The girl's name is Abigail Ashe.

45:44.310 --> 45:46.228
Peter's daughter?

45:46.229 --> 45:48.513
You need to obtain her
from Captain Vane.

45:48.514 --> 45:50.315
Alive and unharmed.

45:50.316 --> 45:52.818
And you need to return her
to Carolina, to her father.

45:52.819 --> 45:55.270
I understand you have feelings
over the girl's welfare, however...

45:55.271 --> 45:57.656
And when you return her,

45:57.657 --> 46:00.075
you're going to explain to Peter

46:00.076 --> 46:03.411
what it is you are trying to
accomplish here.

46:03.412 --> 46:06.164
A Nassau that can self-govern,

46:06.165 --> 46:07.866
pardons for your men, and a
stake in their own future.

46:07.867 --> 46:10.919
What you want. What Thomas wanted.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.538
What we all wanted.

46:13.539 --> 46:14.790
And he is going to help you achieve it.

46:14.791 --> 46:17.008
- He's gonna help me?
- Yes.

46:17.009 --> 46:19.294
And how exactly is he gonna do that?

46:19.295 --> 46:21.963
Thomas knew no one more
skilled or effective

46:21.964 --> 46:25.016
at maneuvering an agenda
through Parliament than Peter.

46:25.017 --> 46:26.318
If he wanted to convince them

46:26.319 --> 46:28.820
to support your vision for
this place, he could do that.

46:28.821 --> 46:30.822
You know he could do that.

46:30.823 --> 46:32.324
We tried it before, it didn't work.

46:32.325 --> 46:35.327
It was a different time.

46:35.328 --> 46:37.662
There's no Alfred Hamilton now.

46:37.663 --> 46:39.664
There's no war with Spain now.

46:39.665 --> 46:42.450
Peter was faced with both those
things and almost succeeded.

46:42.451 --> 46:44.836
Without them,
it is well within his reach.

46:44.837 --> 46:47.489
Miranda, Peter Ashe isn't
the man that you remember.

46:47.490 --> 46:51.343
Six months ago, he hanged
four men in his harbor

46:51.344 --> 46:53.995
for possession of pirated goods.

46:53.996 --> 46:56.081
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with...

46:56.082 --> 46:59.167
- that I can negotiate with.
- Of course you can.

46:59.168 --> 47:02.337
Because you will have just presented
him with his only daughter.

47:02.338 --> 47:05.974
Safe and unharmed
and without conditions.

47:05.975 --> 47:08.510
And you will have reminded him
that you are still the man

47:08.511 --> 47:10.779
who sat in Thomas' salon and spoke of

47:10.780 --> 47:12.813
virtue and reason and forgiveness.

47:18.037 --> 47:20.087
That found inspiration in him.

47:30.016 --> 47:33.635
And you will remind Peter
that somewhere in his heart,

47:33.636 --> 47:35.187
so is he.

47:35.188 --> 47:36.438
This is too important

47:36.439 --> 47:38.890
to put all our fates
in the hands of one man.

47:38.891 --> 47:40.392
Especially a man so committed

47:40.393 --> 47:43.812
to seeing me and everyone else
I know hanged in his harbor.

47:43.813 --> 47:45.380
There is no other way to achieve
what you want to achieve...

47:45.381 --> 47:47.098
Yes there is!

47:47.099 --> 47:49.317
It is sitting on a beach
filled with Spanish soldiers,

47:49.318 --> 47:51.319
- and I'm through delaying.
- There is no other way

47:51.320 --> 47:56.324
once you're willing to tell the
truth about your intentions here.

47:56.325 --> 47:58.960
I think that I've made
my intentions very clear.

47:58.961 --> 48:00.495
No.

48:01.664 --> 48:05.250
You've been anything but clear.

48:05.251 --> 48:08.420
You say you fight for the sake of
Nassau, for the sake of your men,

48:08.421 --> 48:12.390
for the sake of Thomas and his memory.

48:12.391 --> 48:15.093
But the truth of the matter is,
it isn't for any of those things.

48:15.094 --> 48:17.012
What the fuck do you think
I am fighting for?

48:17.013 --> 48:20.765
I think you are fighting
for the sake of fighting.

48:20.766 --> 48:23.518
Because it's the only state
in which you can function.

48:23.519 --> 48:26.154
The only way to keep
that voice in your head

48:26.155 --> 48:27.489
from driving you mad.

48:27.490 --> 48:30.524
What are you talking about?
What voice?

48:33.079 --> 48:37.399
The one telling you
to be ashamed of yourself...

48:37.400 --> 48:39.433
for having loved him.

49:24.246 --> 49:26.834
You were told that it was shameful.

49:27.833 --> 49:29.796
And part of you believed it.

49:31.562 --> 49:33.572
Thomas was my husband.

49:33.573 --> 49:36.558
I loved him and he loved me.

49:36.559 --> 49:39.644
But what he shared with you...

49:39.645 --> 49:43.648
it was entirely something else.

49:43.649 --> 49:47.084
It's time you allowed
yourself to accept that.

49:52.525 --> 49:54.525
The only thing I am ashamed of...

49:57.697 --> 50:01.416
is that I didn't do
something to save him

50:01.417 --> 50:03.450
when we had the chance.

50:08.257 --> 50:11.291
That instead I listened to you.

52:30.637 --> 52:33.758
