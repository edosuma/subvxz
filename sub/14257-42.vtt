Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:07.187 --> 01:08.688
TRUST ME, SHREDDER.

01:08.689 --> 01:11.893
SOON WE WILL HAVE
UNLIMITED FUEL.

01:11.894 --> 01:13.561
DREAM ON, KRANG.

01:13.562 --> 01:15.864
THE TECHNODROME
IS SO LOW ON FUEL,

01:15.865 --> 01:18.735
YOU CAN BARELY POWER
YOUR VIEW SCREENS.

01:18.736 --> 01:21.071
LISTEN, I HAVE JUST LEARNED

01:21.072 --> 01:24.576
THAT A FORMULA EXISTS
IN ANOTHER DIMENSION

01:24.577 --> 01:27.281
THAT CAN TRANSMUTE
CRUDE OIL

01:27.282 --> 01:30.185
INTO LIQUID HYDROGEN.

01:30.186 --> 01:31.286
THE ELEMENT WE NEED

01:31.287 --> 01:33.355
TO POWER
THE TECHNODROME.

01:33.356 --> 01:34.857
WHICH DIMENSION
IS THAT?

01:34.858 --> 01:38.262
IT IS CALLED
DIMENSION "Z",

01:38.263 --> 01:40.566
BUT WE ONLY HAVE
ENOUGH POWER

01:40.567 --> 01:43.336
TO OPEN THE PORTHOLE
TO DIMENSION "Z"

01:43.337 --> 01:45.339
FOR A SHORT TIME.

01:45.340 --> 01:48.710
IT IS OUR ONLY HOPE.

01:48.711 --> 01:51.848
AND WHERE DOES THIS VASE
COME FROM, PROFESSOR?

01:51.849 --> 01:53.884
THE "VAHSE",
MISS O'NEIL,

01:53.885 --> 01:57.389
COMES FROM THE ANCIENT
PROVINCE OF HU YU.

01:57.390 --> 02:01.795
HU YU? IS THAT AN ANSWER
OR A QUESTION?

02:01.796 --> 02:06.134
THE HU YU PROVINCE WAS FAMOUS
FOR ITS FINE PORCELAIN.

02:06.135 --> 02:08.002
THEY SURE TURNED OUT
A LOT OF IT.

02:08.003 --> 02:11.240
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,
THAT MUSEUM HAS
EVERY PIECE EVER MADE.

02:11.241 --> 02:13.244
NOT SO, LEONARDO.

02:13.245 --> 02:16.481
THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO HAS
MORE HU YU PORCELAIN YET.

02:16.482 --> 02:18.751
AND HIS NAME IS SHREDDER.

02:18.752 --> 02:19.820
SHREDDER?

02:19.821 --> 02:22.223
WHEN HE TURNED THE FOOT CLAN
INTO A CRIMINAL ARMY,

02:22.224 --> 02:25.427
HE STOLE ALL
THE HU YU PORCELAIN
HE COULD FIND.

02:25.428 --> 02:27.297
SINCE WHEN
HAS SHREDHEAD

02:27.298 --> 02:29.934
<i>BEEN INTERESTED
IN OBJET D'ART?</i>

02:29.935 --> 02:33.172
IT IS NOT THE QUALITY
HE CARES ABOUT, RAPHAEL.

02:33.173 --> 02:34.673
IT IS THE VALUE.

02:34.674 --> 02:37.443
SUDDENLY,
I'VE GOT AN URGE
TO SEE THAT EXHIBIT.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.351
I THINK I'VE
FOUND DIMENSION "Z",
SHREDDER.

02:42.352 --> 02:44.887
BUT WE HAVE
JUST ENOUGH ENERGY

02:44.888 --> 02:47.391
TO OPEN
THE TRANSDIMENSIONAL
PORTHOLE

02:47.392 --> 02:49.694
FOR 30 SECONDS.

02:49.695 --> 02:54.267
WE MUST GET THAT
OIL TRANSMUTER
FROM DIMENSION "Z",

02:54.268 --> 02:57.138
OR WE'RE FINISHED.

02:57.139 --> 03:01.978
AND THIS IS A FINE EXAMPLE
OF EARLY HU YU DYNASTY.

03:01.979 --> 03:05.649
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH THE YU HU DYNASTY.

03:05.650 --> 03:08.152
HEY, BOSS,
THIS MUSEUM'S GOT

03:08.153 --> 03:11.657
LOTS OF PORCELAIN
JUNK, JUST LIKE YOU.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.093
QUIET, YOU BIRDBRAINS.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.830
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY?

03:15.831 --> 03:18.200
LOOK, THIS MUST BE IT.

03:19.335 --> 03:20.803
THAT'S
DIMENSION "Z"?

03:20.804 --> 03:25.511
WHAT WERE
YOU EXPECTING, MINNEAPOLIS?

03:25.512 --> 03:27.246
THIS
CAN'T BE RIGHT.

03:27.247 --> 03:31.852
DIMENSION "Z" IS
A HIGHLY-EVOLVED
CIVILIZATION.

03:31.853 --> 03:33.755
WHAT DIMENSION
IS THIS?

03:33.756 --> 03:36.426
WHY, IT'S, UM--
OH, I HAD IT A MINUTE AGO.

03:36.427 --> 03:37.693
QUICKLY!

03:37.694 --> 03:41.266
THE PORTAL WILL CLOSE
IN 5 SECONDS.

03:41.267 --> 03:43.602
IT WILL? UH-OH!

03:43.603 --> 03:44.937
WHAT IN BLAZES?

03:46.441 --> 03:48.608
JUST IN TIME.

03:48.609 --> 03:49.477
WHO ARE YOU?

03:49.478 --> 03:52.380
OGG'S THE NAME--
MR. OGG TO YOU.

03:52.381 --> 03:55.652
OH. NICE MASK. HA!

03:55.653 --> 03:57.655
I CAN SEE WHY
YOU WEAR IT.

03:57.656 --> 03:59.958
OW! WHY, YOU...

04:01.795 --> 04:05.499
NOW IS THAT ANY WAY
TO TREAT A GUEST?

04:08.370 --> 04:13.076
BEBOP, ROCKSTEADY,
TAKE CARE OF THIS
INSOLENT CREATURE.

04:13.077 --> 04:15.913
OK, YOU LITTLE
PIPSQUEAK.

04:15.914 --> 04:17.649
<i>YOU THINK
I'M LITTLE?</i>

04:19.184 --> 04:20.986
YOU BIG BULLY!

04:20.987 --> 04:24.258
MAKE US
NORMAL MUTANTS AGAIN!

04:24.259 --> 04:26.027
WE MUST
STOP THIS ALIEN

04:26.028 --> 04:29.499
BEFORE HE DOES
ANY MORE DAMAGE.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.768
I'M WARNING YOU.

04:31.769 --> 04:35.506
TAKE ONE MORE STEP,
AND YOU'LL BE SORRY.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.979
HE'S TURNED
THE TECHNODROME

04:39.980 --> 04:41.449
INTO A PUMPKIN.

04:41.450 --> 04:44.619
I THINK I ONCE HEARD THIS
IN A FAIRY TALE.

04:48.459 --> 04:50.894
I WILL DESTROY
THAT MIDGET.

04:50.895 --> 04:51.830
WAIT.

04:52.898 --> 04:57.136
HMM. MUST BE
A CHOP SUEY JOINT.

04:59.306 --> 05:02.210
1,000-YEAR-OLD
HU YU PORCELAIN.

05:03.847 --> 05:05.648
THIS STUFF IS THE BEST!

05:05.649 --> 05:08.151
HE'S IN MY PERSONAL
QUARTERS!

05:10.222 --> 05:13.726
MY ANTIQUE VASES--
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

05:14.928 --> 05:16.397
THOSE WERE YOURS?

05:16.398 --> 05:18.400
OH, YOU REALLY
HAVE GOOD TASTE.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.904
OH, AND THEY TASTED GOOD.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.807
HE'S EATEN
MY PORCELAIN COLLECTION!

05:26.311 --> 05:28.747
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

05:28.748 --> 05:34.422
MR. OGG, I NOTICED
YOUR FONDNESS FOR
ANTIQUE VASES.

05:34.423 --> 05:37.793
HA HA! I LOVE 'EM!
I LOVE 'EM!

05:37.794 --> 05:39.529
THE OLDER, THE BETTER.

05:39.530 --> 05:40.596
WELL, I KNOW WHERE

05:40.597 --> 05:43.601
YOU CAN GET
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

05:43.602 --> 05:45.336
THOUSANDS OF THEM?

05:45.337 --> 05:46.872
WHERE? WHERE? WHERE?

05:46.873 --> 05:48.173
TELL ME, TELL ME,
TELL ME WHERE!

05:48.174 --> 05:50.577
NOT SO FAST,
MY FRIEND.

05:50.578 --> 05:52.947
FIRST, YOU MUST
HELP US.

05:52.948 --> 05:55.918
OH, ANYTHING.
NAME IT, IT'S YOURS.

05:55.919 --> 05:58.722
CHANGE THIS PLACE
BACK TO NORMAL.

05:58.723 --> 06:00.257
DONE.

06:03.863 --> 06:08.368
OH, I WAS STARTING TO GET
AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.805
OK, WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE?

06:10.806 --> 06:13.242
NOW GIVE ME
THAT FORMULA

06:13.243 --> 06:17.213
THAT TRANSMUTES OIL
INTO LIQUID HYDROGEN.

06:17.214 --> 06:19.717
DONE AND DOUBLE-DONE. 

06:19.718 --> 06:20.852
LET'S SEE HERE.

06:20.853 --> 06:23.790
"ONE--TEAR OPEN
ON DOTTED LINE.

06:23.791 --> 06:26.861
"TWO--
SPRINKLE CONTENTS
ON CRUDE OIL.

06:26.862 --> 06:28.930
THREE--
CONQUER WORLD."

06:28.931 --> 06:29.998
NOW WHERE ARE
THOSE ANTIQUES AT,

06:29.999 --> 06:31.934
OLD PAL, OLD BUDDY,
OLD FRIEND?

06:31.935 --> 06:34.772
WHY, UP THERE.
IN THE CITY.

06:34.773 --> 06:37.676
WE'D TAKE YOU
THERE OURSELVES,

06:37.677 --> 06:40.112
BUT THE BAD PEOPLE
WHO LIVE THERE

06:40.113 --> 06:42.349
WON'T LET US
VISIT.

06:42.350 --> 06:44.686
OH, HOW TERRIBLE.

06:44.687 --> 06:47.723
YES.
THEY PERSECUTED US

06:47.724 --> 06:50.326
AND DROVE US
INTO THE GROUND.

06:50.327 --> 06:54.198
WE'RE THE VICTIMS
OF HUMAN CRUELTY.

06:55.234 --> 06:58.270
THAT'S THE SADDEST STORY
I EVER HEARD.

06:58.271 --> 07:00.974
WHO DID THESE
TERRIBLE THINGS TO YOU?

07:00.975 --> 07:05.413
THEY ALL DID,
BUT ESPECIALLY
THOSE FOUR VICIOUS--

07:05.414 --> 07:07.449
TURTLES.

07:07.450 --> 07:10.053
TURTLES

07:10.054 --> 07:12.890
I'LL SHOW 'EM
THEY CAN'T KICK
MY BUDDIES AROUND.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.560
I'LL MAKE 'EM WISH
THEY'D NEVER BEEN HATCHED.

07:16.731 --> 07:19.033
DO YOU THINK
WE CAN TRUST HIM?

07:19.034 --> 07:23.304
WHO KNOWS? BUT WHILE
HE DISPATCHES THE TURTLES,

07:23.305 --> 07:25.575
YOU COP AN OIL TANKER.

07:25.576 --> 07:27.778
WHERE WOULD YOU BE
WITHOUT ME

07:27.779 --> 07:29.981
TO DO YOUR THINKING
FOR YOU?

07:31.650 --> 07:33.652
ALL RIGHT, YOU BUNCH
OF MEANIES,

07:33.653 --> 07:35.555
I'LL TEACH YOU TO PERSECUTE

07:35.556 --> 07:37.825
INNOCENT LITTLE
ALIEN BRAINS.

07:46.104 --> 07:49.407
DONATELLO, THESE ARE
AWFUL DISGUISES.

07:49.408 --> 07:51.209
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO BE, ANYWAY?

07:51.210 --> 07:54.481
I THINK IT'S
A BUNCH OF SQUARES,
DUDE.

07:54.482 --> 07:56.618
UH, GUYS...

07:56.619 --> 07:59.020
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY WRONG HERE.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.388
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

08:00.389 --> 08:02.793
NOBODY WEARS
FOUR-BUTTON CUFFS ANYMORE.

08:02.794 --> 08:07.466
NO, I MEAN THAT BARBER POLE
THAT USED TO BE A SKYSCRAPER.

08:07.467 --> 08:09.535
SAY, THAT IS ODD.

08:09.536 --> 08:11.638
NO, IT'S OGG!

08:11.639 --> 08:14.276
HA! AND ALL YOU
NASTY-TYPE PEOPLE

08:14.277 --> 08:17.713
MUST PAY FOR
PUSHING AROUND
MY ALIEN BUDDIES.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.350
IT'S A LITTLE
3-FOOT HIGH
FLOATING VISITOR

08:20.351 --> 08:21.719
FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION.

08:21.720 --> 08:25.157
NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

08:27.328 --> 08:29.329
OUR SUITS
HAVE DISAPPEARED.

08:29.330 --> 08:32.567
HEY, YOU'RE
THOSE EVIL TURTLES.

08:32.568 --> 08:34.068
I'LL FIX YOU.

08:38.943 --> 08:42.847
THIS IS TOTALLY BOGUS
BEHAVIOR, MICRODUDE.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.657
OF COURSE YOU REALIZE
THIS MEANS WAR! HA!

09:00.172 --> 09:01.607
LOOK OUT!

09:01.608 --> 09:03.008
A CHAIN SAW!
IT'S HUGE!

09:05.780 --> 09:07.115
OH, YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO TOUGH

09:07.116 --> 09:08.951
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOT SHELLS?

09:08.952 --> 09:12.122
THIS'LL MAKE
A GREAT MOVIE...

09:12.123 --> 09:14.958
<i>THE TURTLE
CHAINSAW MASSACRE.</i>

09:17.130 --> 09:20.467
WHAT HAS THIS GUY
GOT AGAINST TURTLES?

09:20.468 --> 09:21.601
WHY DON'T
YOU ASK HIM?

09:21.602 --> 09:24.205
WE'VE GOTTA
LURE THAT THING
OVER THERE.

09:24.206 --> 09:26.641
OVER HERE!
COME OVER HERE!

09:26.642 --> 09:27.643
TRY AND GET US!

09:28.811 --> 09:30.180
GO!

09:31.549 --> 09:34.886
WE'VE GOT SOME
QUESTIONS FOR YOU,
MISTER.

09:34.887 --> 09:36.622
RIGHT. LIKE, UH...

09:36.623 --> 09:39.492
HOW MANY TREES
TO THE GALLON
THAT CHAINSAW GETS.

09:39.493 --> 09:42.497
WE'RE GOING
TO CLEAN YOUR CLOCK.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.432
GUESS AGAIN, EINSTEIN.

09:46.904 --> 09:49.740
WELL, UH, MAYBE WE CAN
CLEAN YOUR LIVING ROOM.

09:49.741 --> 09:51.509
I'LL PLASTER YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID

09:51.510 --> 09:53.812
TO MY PALS
SHREDDER AND KRANG.

09:56.451 --> 09:59.320
CHOCOLATE.

09:59.321 --> 10:01.055
UNH. THERE IS NO WAY

10:01.056 --> 10:02.924
WE'RE GOING
TO BEAT THAT GUY.

10:04.595 --> 10:06.496
BUT AT LEAST
WE'LL ALL EAT WELL.

10:06.497 --> 10:09.334
HE SAID
SHREDDER AND KRANG.

10:09.335 --> 10:11.971
I HAD A FEELING
THOSE TWO WERE BEHIND THIS.

10:13.607 --> 10:16.876
EXCUSE ME, I WONDER
IF I MIGHT RENT YOUR BOAT?

10:16.877 --> 10:18.879
SORRY,
SHE'S NOT AVAILABLE.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.484
THEN I WONDER
IF I MIGHT TAKE IT?

10:24.021 --> 10:27.892
MUTINY! PIRACY!
I'LL PUT YOU IN IRONS!

10:28.961 --> 10:30.530
THERE SHE IS,

10:30.531 --> 10:32.198
4 MILLION BARRELS
OF OIL,

10:32.199 --> 10:34.901
OURS FOR THE TAKING!

10:34.902 --> 10:36.938
OOH, SHIVER ME TIMBERS.

10:36.939 --> 10:40.610
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
SHIVER MINE ALSO.

10:42.247 --> 10:44.915
WE'D LIKE A WORD
WITH YOU, MR. OGG.

10:44.916 --> 10:48.655
HA! YOU GUYS ARE GETTING
TOO HOT UNDER THE COLLAR.

10:48.656 --> 10:51.024
WHY DON'T YOU
COOL OFF?

10:51.025 --> 10:53.094
HAVE SOME ICE CREAM.

10:58.169 --> 11:01.071
THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST SUNDAE,

11:01.072 --> 11:03.941
AND IT'S ONLY TUESDAY.

11:06.714 --> 11:09.784
YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING TO
DISLIKE THAT LITTLE TWERP.

11:09.785 --> 11:11.118
YEAH, BUT YOU
GOTTA ADMIT

11:11.119 --> 11:13.121
HE PICKS GOOD FLAVORS.
[SLURPS]

11:14.391 --> 11:17.126
LISTEN, OGG,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

11:17.127 --> 11:21.333
BECAUSE YOU'RE MEAN
TO MY PALS SHREDDER
AND KRANG.

11:21.334 --> 11:23.236
BUT THEY'RE EVIL, DUDE.

11:23.237 --> 11:26.040
THEY WANT TO, LIKE,
CONQUER THE WORLD.

11:26.041 --> 11:28.677
SO? WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BEING AN OVERACHIEVER?

11:35.253 --> 11:38.223
ALL RIGHT,
YOU LITTLE CREEPOLA.

11:39.392 --> 11:40.892
THIS IS
A PRICELESS ANTIQUE.

11:40.893 --> 11:42.729
BE CAREFUL
WITH IT!

11:42.730 --> 11:45.165
WAIT. YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT SKYSCRAPERS...

11:45.166 --> 11:46.166
OR AUTOMOBILES...

11:46.167 --> 11:48.303
OR STREET LIGHTS.

11:48.304 --> 11:51.007
SO WHY THIS CONCERN
ABOUT A VASE?

11:51.008 --> 11:53.744
<i>"VAHSE,"
YOU UNCULTURED
PHILISTINE!</i>

11:53.745 --> 11:57.250
IT'S A
1000-YEAR-OLD
HU YU VASE.

11:57.251 --> 11:58.183
SEE?

11:59.754 --> 12:03.224
MAN, THERE IS
JUST NO ACCOUNTING
FOR TASTE.

12:06.263 --> 12:07.162
AHOY, TANKER!

12:07.163 --> 12:09.833
PREPARE TO BE BOARDED.

12:11.770 --> 12:14.640
FOLLOW ME, MATES.

12:14.641 --> 12:16.209
HEY. WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

12:16.210 --> 12:18.146
GETTING RID OF YOU.

12:25.121 --> 12:28.359
THIS VESSEL WILL
SURRENDER TO ME AT ONCE.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.862
UH, HOIST UP
YOUR POOP DECK.

12:30.863 --> 12:33.466
MIZZEN
YOUR MAINMAST.

12:34.735 --> 12:37.204
LOOK OUT!

12:40.710 --> 12:43.012
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH
OF THIS STUFF.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.316
YOU LIKE
TO EAT PORCELAIN?

12:45.317 --> 12:46.250
OH, YEAH!

12:46.251 --> 12:49.588
ESPECIALLY THE WELL-AGED
1000-YEAR-OLD VARIETY

12:49.589 --> 12:50.657
LIKE THIS.

12:50.658 --> 12:53.160
BUT YOU'VE GOT
ALL THAT POWER.

12:53.161 --> 12:55.997
WHY NOT JUST
WIGGLE YOUR FINGERS
AND MAKE SOME?

12:55.998 --> 12:57.499
HEY. IF I JUST
MADE IT,

12:57.500 --> 12:59.836
IT WOULDN'T BE
1000 YEARS OLD,
WOULD IT?

12:59.837 --> 13:02.305
FIRST, I'M GONNA
FINISH THIS.

13:02.306 --> 13:04.308
THEN I'M GONNA
FINISH YOU TURTLES--

13:04.309 --> 13:06.244
HA! FOR GOOD.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.848
GUYS, I'VE GOT A PLAN.

13:08.849 --> 13:12.586
CALL ME NUTSY,
BUT I DON'T THINK
OGG CAN HURT US.

13:12.587 --> 13:14.356
OK, NUTSY.
I'LL BITE.

13:14.357 --> 13:17.560
THINK ABOUT IT.
HE COULD BE MAKING
BOMBS AND BULLETS,

13:17.561 --> 13:19.096
BUT INSTEAD HE'S TRYING
TO TAKE US OUT

13:19.097 --> 13:21.032
WITH PIES AND ICE CREAM.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.869
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT
A BAD WAY TO GO.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.437
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT

13:25.438 --> 13:27.974
WHAT HIS CONNECTION IS
TO SHREDDER AND KRANG.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.711
BUT, LIKE, HOW?

13:29.712 --> 13:32.347
I TOLD YA.
I GOT A PLAN.

13:34.418 --> 13:37.254
HEY, OGGIE, OLD BOY.
UH, WOULD YOU SPARE US

13:37.255 --> 13:40.392
IF WE COULD GET YOU
SOME MORE OF THAT
ANTIQUE PORCELAIN?

13:40.393 --> 13:41.459
WOULD I?

13:41.460 --> 13:43.629
I MIGHT EVEN
DO YOU A FAVOR

13:43.630 --> 13:47.067
LIKE I DID MY PALS
SHREDDER AND KRANG.

13:47.068 --> 13:49.905
WHAT FAVOR IS THAT,
LITTLE DUDE?

13:49.906 --> 13:50.972
NOTHING SPECIAL.

13:50.973 --> 13:52.307
I GAVE THEM
A CHEMICAL

13:52.308 --> 13:54.076
THAT'LL TURN
THAT TANKER OIL
THEY'RE STEALING

13:54.077 --> 13:55.413
INTO LIQUID
HYDROGEN.

13:55.414 --> 13:56.881
BUT WITH ALL THAT FUEL,

13:56.882 --> 13:58.550
THEY COULD REPOWER
THE TECHNODROME

13:58.551 --> 14:00.253
AND RULE THE WORLD.

14:00.254 --> 14:01.988
WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?

14:01.989 --> 14:04.324
WHERE'S MY PORCELAIN?

14:04.325 --> 14:07.161
WE'LL GET IT FOR YOU.
BUT WE'LL NEED YOUR HELP.

14:07.162 --> 14:10.332
JUST COME WITH US.
AND NO MORE TROUBLE.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.036
OH...NO MORE TROUBLE.

14:13.037 --> 14:14.639
I PROMISE.

14:14.640 --> 14:18.444
HA! TURTLES ARE SUCH
TRUSTING LITTLE SOULS.

14:18.445 --> 14:22.016
EXCELLENT.
THE FORCE OF GRAVITY
WILL PULL THE OIL

14:22.017 --> 14:23.550
DOWN THROUGH
THE HOLE WE MADE

14:23.551 --> 14:25.120
WITH THE PNEUMATIC
MODULE

14:25.121 --> 14:27.289
STRAIGHT INTO
THE TECHNODROME.

14:28.358 --> 14:29.893
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP US,
APRIL?

14:29.894 --> 14:31.295
ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:31.296 --> 14:34.198
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR
AN EXCLUSIVE STORY ABOUT HIM.

14:34.199 --> 14:37.370
DONATELLO, YOU GET
TO THE LAIR, AND FAST.

14:37.371 --> 14:39.539
WE NEED
OUR PANDIMENSIONAL
PORTAL GENERATOR.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.476
YOU GOT IT.

14:41.477 --> 14:43.879
MICHELANGELO,
YOU AND RAPHAEL
STOP SHREDDER

14:43.880 --> 14:45.315
FROM STEALING THAT OIL.

14:46.884 --> 14:49.854
HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

14:49.855 --> 14:52.826
KEEP QUIET
IF YOU WANT
THAT PORCELAIN.

14:54.695 --> 14:57.164
SORRY.
THE MUSEUM'S CLOSED.

14:57.165 --> 14:59.033
APRIL O'NEIL,
CHANNEL 6 NEWS.

14:59.034 --> 15:01.838
I'VE GOT A DEADLINE
IN 5 MINUTES.

15:01.839 --> 15:03.807
I-I DON'T KNOW,
MISS O'NEIL,

15:03.808 --> 15:06.010
NOBODY SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

15:06.011 --> 15:08.112
IT'S OK. TRUST ME.

15:08.113 --> 15:10.115
OH, I'M HER CAMERAMAN.

15:10.116 --> 15:12.352
WHAT'S THIS?

15:12.353 --> 15:15.489
MY NEW LIGHTWEIGHT
CAMERA EQUIPMENT.

15:16.726 --> 15:19.328
LET ME OUT OF HERE.

15:19.329 --> 15:21.097
HEY. WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

15:21.098 --> 15:23.266
UM, WE WERE OPENING
THE PORCELAIN DISPLAY CASE

15:23.267 --> 15:24.536
FOR YOU.

15:24.537 --> 15:26.537
OH, BOY, OH, BOY!
HA!

15:26.538 --> 15:28.440
YUM YUM! LET ME AT 'EM.

15:30.044 --> 15:31.578
YOU TRICKED ME!

15:36.386 --> 15:38.388
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

15:38.389 --> 15:41.225
WE'VE GOT TO GET OGG
BACK TO HIS OWN DIMENSION.

15:41.226 --> 15:43.795
AND WE'VE GOT TO DO IT
BEFORE HE TURNS
THE WHOLE CITY

15:43.796 --> 15:47.066
INTO ONE GIGANTIC FRUIT SALAD.

15:53.210 --> 15:55.143
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

15:57.481 --> 16:00.284
I'LL GET YOU
FOR TRICKING ME!

16:02.155 --> 16:03.021
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO?

16:03.022 --> 16:05.091
HE'S FLIPPING OUT
COMPLETELY.

16:05.092 --> 16:07.260
LET'S HOPE DONATELLO
GETS HERE SOON

16:07.261 --> 16:08.562
WITH THE PORTAL GENERATOR.

16:11.668 --> 16:15.271
THIS TRANSDIMENSIONAL
PORTAL GENERATOR
WEIGHS A TON.

16:15.272 --> 16:17.942
BOY, EVERYONE ELSE
GETS TO RIDE AROUND
ON BOATS

16:17.943 --> 16:19.945
OR CAPTURE
WEIRD CREATURES.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.448
ME, I GET ALL
THE HARD WORK.

16:23.851 --> 16:26.420
SCOPE IT OUT.
THERE'S THE TANKER.

16:26.421 --> 16:28.256
AND LOOK WHO'S
PLAYING PIRATE--

16:28.257 --> 16:30.527
IT'S BEBOP
AND ROCKSTEADY.

16:30.528 --> 16:32.428
HOLY GUACAMOLE!

16:32.429 --> 16:34.665
OGG MUST BE
PARTYING AGAIN.

16:34.666 --> 16:36.601
HE'S TURNED
THE STATUE
OF LIBERTY

16:36.602 --> 16:38.304
INTO A CHEAP
SOUVENIR.

16:38.305 --> 16:41.474
THIS TIME,
THE DUDE'S GONE TOO FAR!

16:44.847 --> 16:46.883
LEONARDO,
LOOK OUT!

16:46.884 --> 16:48.218
WHAT IN THE WORLD...

16:48.219 --> 16:51.488
I'LL TEACH YOU
TO TRICK ME!

16:52.591 --> 16:55.160
ICE CREAM!
AND IT'S BLOCKING THE EXIT.

16:55.161 --> 16:57.397
ISN'T THERE
A FIRE LAW
AGAINST THAT?

16:57.398 --> 16:59.166
HEY, WE CAN GO
OUT THIS WINDOW.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.735
ARE YOU NUTS?

17:00.736 --> 17:04.073
NUTS! HA! THAT'S WHAT
I FORGOT.

17:04.074 --> 17:06.409
ME AND MY BIG MOUTH.

17:06.410 --> 17:08.411
AAH!
LOOK OUT!

17:12.953 --> 17:16.256
I DEFINITELY MUST ASK
MR. THOMPSON FOR A RAISE.

17:16.257 --> 17:19.761
IN A FEW MINUTES,
THE TANKS WILL
BE DRAINED.

17:19.762 --> 17:21.930
ALL THAT OIL
WILL BE OURS.

17:21.931 --> 17:24.666
GIVE IT UP, GUYS.
IT'S OVER.

17:24.667 --> 17:25.868
THE TURTLES!

17:25.869 --> 17:27.436
BEBOP!
ROCKSTEADY!

17:27.438 --> 17:28.807
GET THEM!

17:29.943 --> 17:32.145
YOU TURTLES
WILL HAVE TO GET UP

17:32.146 --> 17:34.548
OILY IN THE MORNING
TO BEAT ME.

17:34.549 --> 17:36.618
WHY SHOULD THEY GET
ALL THE BAD PUNS?

17:40.457 --> 17:42.859
ENOUGH OF THIS.
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.799
I THINK
WE DITCHED OGG.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.533
BUT HE'S GOING
TO TEAR UP THE CITY

17:48.534 --> 17:51.371
UNTIL WE FIND A SUBSTITUTE
FOR THOSE ANTIQUES.

17:51.372 --> 17:54.876
WELL, YOU'VE ONLY
GOT ONE OPTION
THAT I CAN SEE.

17:54.877 --> 17:57.180
"HAYWARD'S
BARGAIN BASEMENT.

17:57.181 --> 17:59.983
FINE IMITATION
ANTIQUES." PERFECT.

18:01.252 --> 18:02.620
A HALF DOZEN OF YOUR FINEST

18:02.621 --> 18:05.324
CHEAP IMITATION
HU YU VASES--

18:05.325 --> 18:07.494
VAHSES...OH, NEVER MIND.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.429
NOW TO FIND OGG.

18:09.430 --> 18:11.332
UNLESS HE FINDS US FIRST.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.769
OH, THIS IS IT. HA!

18:13.770 --> 18:16.506
NO MORE MR. NICE ALIEN.

18:16.507 --> 18:18.309
WE CAN'T LET HIM HAVE
THE VASES

18:18.310 --> 18:19.944
UNTIL DONATELLO GETS
HERE.

18:21.180 --> 18:23.683
THAT'S THE LAST
OF THE OIL, BOSS.

18:23.684 --> 18:26.086
NOW TO RETURN
TO THE TECHNODROME

18:26.087 --> 18:28.689
AND WATCH KRANG TURN IT
INTO LIQUID HYDROGEN.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.759
BUT FIRST...
THIS TIME BOMB

18:30.760 --> 18:34.531
SHOULD DO THE JOB
NICELY, TURTLES.
HA HA HA!

18:35.599 --> 18:39.171
I'M GOING
TO TURN YOU INTO...

18:39.172 --> 18:40.639
SOMETHING AWFUL.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.543
NOW, DON'T DO
ANYTHING RASH, OGG.

18:43.544 --> 18:47.382
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF FRESH
ANTIQUE VASES FOR YOU.

18:47.383 --> 18:48.649
DONATELLO, HURRY!

18:48.650 --> 18:50.219
WE NEED YOU.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.223
SORRY, BUT
THIS THING IS HEAVY.

18:53.224 --> 18:56.227
NOW HAND OVER
THOSE VASES!

18:58.665 --> 19:02.703
WOW. I'VE GOT TO GET
SOME FOOTAGE OF THIS.

19:02.704 --> 19:05.674
QUICK, FELLAS, LOOK AT THIS.

19:05.675 --> 19:08.111
IT MUST BE SOME KIND
OF ILLUSION.

19:08.112 --> 19:09.913
AND THE CAMERA
DOESN'T PICK IT UP.

19:09.914 --> 19:11.681
EVEN IF IT IS
AN ILLUSION,

19:11.682 --> 19:14.919
WE'VE STILL GOT
TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.689
HERE THEY ARE, OGG.

19:16.690 --> 19:19.292
HA! GIMME, GIMME, GIMME!

19:19.293 --> 19:21.095
I NEED THOSE BABIES.

19:21.096 --> 19:22.363
YOU'LL GET THEM,

19:22.364 --> 19:23.798
BUT FIRST,
YOU'VE GOT TO DO US

19:23.799 --> 19:25.367
A COUPLE OF FAVORS.

19:25.368 --> 19:28.271
UH, YOU NAME IT,
YOU GOT IT.

19:28.272 --> 19:30.441
MAKE EVERYTHING
NORMAL AGAIN.

19:30.442 --> 19:31.542
DEAL.

19:37.786 --> 19:39.487
OK. WHAT NEXT?
AND MAKE IT SNAPPY.

19:39.488 --> 19:41.056
I'M STARVING.

19:41.057 --> 19:43.892
COULD YOU SHOW ME
THE DIMENSION YOU COME FROM,

19:43.893 --> 19:45.695
JUST SO I COULD SAY I SAW IT?

19:48.400 --> 19:50.302
THERE IT IS.
WHAT A DUMP, HUH?

19:50.303 --> 19:52.906
OK. NOW LET ME HAVE 'EM.

19:52.907 --> 19:55.576
YOU HEARD HIM, LEONARDO.
LET HIM HAVE IT.

19:55.577 --> 19:57.812
COME AND GET IT.

19:59.749 --> 20:02.886
AND AWAY WE GO!

20:05.624 --> 20:06.825
AND THAT, FOLKS,

20:06.826 --> 20:10.229
IS THE LAST WE'LL BE SEEING
OF MR. OGG.

20:10.230 --> 20:13.067
WE'RE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES.

20:13.068 --> 20:14.068
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE
TO ESCAPE

20:14.069 --> 20:15.737
FROM A CORNY SETUP
LIKE THIS.

20:15.738 --> 20:17.506
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:17.507 --> 20:18.975
WELL, I SAW THIS FLICK

20:18.976 --> 20:22.246
WHERE A TIED-UP DUDE WIGGLED
TILL HE FELL OVER.

20:25.185 --> 20:27.787
OK. WHAT DID THE GUY
DO THEN?

20:27.788 --> 20:29.690
I DON'T KNOW.

20:29.691 --> 20:31.526
I WENT OUT FOR POPCORN.

20:37.535 --> 20:39.904
BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE
TO STOP SHREDDER.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.374
HE'S GOT ALL THAT OIL
IN THE TECHNODROME.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.644
ISN'T THAT JUST TOO BAD?

20:50.386 --> 20:53.689
TO TURN THIS OIL
INTO LIQUID HYDROGEN.

20:55.159 --> 20:56.893
IT'S HAPPENING!

20:56.894 --> 20:58.196
IT'S HAPPENING!

21:00.065 --> 21:01.867
IT'S NOT HAPPENING!

21:01.868 --> 21:04.605
WE'VE BEEN TRICKED!

21:04.606 --> 21:06.274
WHO'S GOING
TO CLEAN UP
THIS MESS?

21:06.275 --> 21:08.643
IF WE KEEP
OUR EYES SHUT,

21:08.644 --> 21:10.545
THEY'LL NEVER
FIND US.

21:12.116 --> 21:13.417
NOW THAT OGG'S GONE,
IT'S KINDA NICE

21:13.418 --> 21:15.519
TO BE ABLE TO TELL
WHAT'S WHAT AGAIN.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.356
HOW'S THE PIZZA,
MICHELANGELO?

21:17.357 --> 21:20.125
COMING RIGHT UP,
AMIGOS.

21:22.363 --> 21:23.763
OH! BUMMER, DUDES.

21:23.764 --> 21:26.034
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE PIZZA.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.904
MAYBE WE DIDN'T
GET RID OF OGG
AFTER ALL.

21:30.107 --> 21:32.477
THERE'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR TRICKING ME.

21:34.614 --> 21:36.248
I NEARLY
CHIPPED A TOOTH

21:36.249 --> 21:38.251
ON THIS CHEAP
IMITATION PORCELAIN.

21:39.721 --> 21:41.121
TAKE THAT!

21:41.122 --> 21:42.223
AND THAT!

21:42.224 --> 21:43.491
AND THAT!

21:43.492 --> 21:46.228
YOU KNOW, HE'S KIND OF CUTE
WHEN HE'S ANGRY.
