WEBVTT

00:17.379 --> 00:19.792
- Hey...
you want a carrot?

00:19.793 --> 00:21.412
- Pfft, no way,

00:21.413 --> 00:22.931
I'm not fallin'
for that trick again.

00:30.241 --> 00:33.102
- Uh, why are you
putting a purple afro

00:33.103 --> 00:34.723
on the llama?

00:34.724 --> 00:37.171
- Hey, you want him to look
like a real llama or not?

00:37.172 --> 00:39.378
- Well yeah but...

00:39.379 --> 00:42.724
Nevermind.

00:44.103 --> 00:45.619
- All right, I'm sorry I'm late,

00:45.620 --> 00:47.895
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm late.

00:47.896 --> 00:49.171
- We're all sorry.

00:49.172 --> 00:51.481
- 'Cuz you're very late.

00:51.482 --> 00:53.447
- I know.
I tried to take a cab here,

00:53.448 --> 00:54.723
but I wasn't payin' attention,

00:54.724 --> 00:57.068
so I just got into
some random yellow car.

00:58.827 --> 01:00.723
And the guy drove me
all the way to Flatbush

01:00.724 --> 01:02.481
before I could jump out
at a stop light.

01:02.482 --> 01:04.792
- Whoa, that sounds scary.

01:04.793 --> 01:06.585
- I know.

01:06.586 --> 01:09.826
I feel pretty traumatized.

01:09.827 --> 01:11.550
- Well y'know what
might be good for that?

01:11.551 --> 01:13.309
- What?
- Put your junk down

01:13.310 --> 01:15.964
and start working.

01:15.965 --> 01:17.792
- Okay. Junk down.

01:17.793 --> 01:19.550
So, what are we workin' on?

01:19.551 --> 01:21.447
- I sent you an email
about it this morning,

01:21.448 --> 01:23.826
didn't you read it?

01:23.827 --> 01:26.067
- Yeah-Yeah, of course
I read your email.

01:26.068 --> 01:28.999
- Uhuh...
- But uh,

01:29.000 --> 01:30.619
just in case I'm lyin',

01:30.620 --> 01:33.964
what'd your email say again?

01:33.965 --> 01:35.412
- Okay...
did you know that yesterday,

01:35.413 --> 01:36.826
your dad bought a llama farm?

01:36.827 --> 01:37.999
- A llama fa...?!?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.723
Why would my dad
want a buncha llamas?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.447
- 'Cuz he found out
that Drake has two llamas,

01:41.448 --> 01:43.688
so Dub just had
to "out-do" Drake

01:43.689 --> 01:46.550
by buying an entire llama farm.

01:46.551 --> 01:49.172
- Aw, why dad, whyyyy?

01:50.689 --> 01:53.000
- Your dad's not up there.

01:55.586 --> 01:57.343
- Anyway, now Dub says
that Game Shakers

01:57.344 --> 01:59.136
has to make a game about llamas.

01:59.137 --> 02:00.861
- For what?

02:00.862 --> 02:03.309
- To "raise llama awareness."

02:03.310 --> 02:05.585
- Ah geez.
- It's all right.

02:05.586 --> 02:06.964
I came up with
a pretty cool game idea.

02:06.965 --> 02:09.412
- Yeah. It's called
"Llama Llama Spit Spit."

02:09.413 --> 02:11.412
- Interesting.
So what's it about?

02:11.413 --> 02:13.895
- It's about a llama.

02:13.896 --> 02:16.895
Who spits.

02:16.896 --> 02:20.619
- This was all covered
in my email.

02:20.620 --> 02:23.757
- So we're gonna
do a test with this thing?

02:23.758 --> 02:25.067
- Yep. We need to try out

02:25.068 --> 02:26.654
some different levels
of spit power.

02:26.655 --> 02:28.067
Um, Hudson, turn on the water.

02:28.068 --> 02:30.343
- Si, agua.

02:30.344 --> 02:33.343
- Random Spanish...

02:33.344 --> 02:35.274
- Trip, get this test
on video, okay?

02:35.275 --> 02:36.999
- You got it, boss.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.309
- Llama Llama Spit Spit.

02:38.310 --> 02:40.792
Spit test, number one.
Game Shakers.

02:40.793 --> 02:43.792
Test moderators:
Kenzie Bell, Babe Carano,

02:43.793 --> 02:45.723
Triple G. Griffin,
and Hudson Gim...

02:45.724 --> 02:48.205
- Just start the test!

02:48.206 --> 02:50.827
Whenever you're ready.

02:57.482 --> 02:58.550
- Rolling...

02:58.551 --> 03:01.551
- Spit level one.
Go.

03:03.758 --> 03:07.723
- Wooh!
- Haha!

03:07.724 --> 03:11.102
- And now...
Spit level two.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.757
Go Babe.

03:14.689 --> 03:16.689
- Whoa, whoa whoa whoa,
shut it down, shut it down.

03:18.689 --> 03:20.033
- Wait, what happened?

03:20.034 --> 03:21.136
- I dunno...

03:21.137 --> 03:22.757
I'm gonna check
the water distributor.

03:22.758 --> 03:25.619
- Hey Trip, look inside
the llama's mouth

03:25.620 --> 03:28.067
and see if the spit valve
looks clogged.

03:28.068 --> 03:29.723
- All right, lemme just check
in here and see if...

03:29.724 --> 03:31.757
Wait, nope, nope, unh-uh.

03:31.758 --> 03:33.033
- What's the prob?

03:33.034 --> 03:35.309
- If I look in
that llama's mouth,

03:35.310 --> 03:36.688
I'll guarantee you
I'm gonna end up

03:36.689 --> 03:39.033
with a face fulla wet spit.

03:39.034 --> 03:40.378
- No you won't.

03:40.379 --> 03:41.930
- It's not even
working right now.

03:41.931 --> 03:43.792
- Well, I've been workin'
here at Game Shakers

03:43.793 --> 03:46.654
long enough to know that
if somethin' bad CAN happen,

03:46.655 --> 03:48.309
it's gonna happen to ME.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.861
- I'll do it.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.758
I love spit from all creatures.

03:53.620 --> 03:54.930
- While you do that...

03:54.931 --> 03:56.620
I'm gonna stand
all the way over here.

03:58.965 --> 04:01.067
- Hmmm...
I don't see anything moving.

04:01.068 --> 04:02.136
- Keep looking.

04:02.137 --> 04:05.171
- Yeah, c'mon,
get your face in there.

04:05.172 --> 04:08.481
- Okay. How 'bout now?

04:08.482 --> 04:09.550
- Uh... nope.

04:09.551 --> 04:11.585
- Weird.

04:11.586 --> 04:14.758
How 'bout... now?

let's go, let's go.

05:10.379 --> 05:11.895

05:11.896 --> 05:14.274
- Ah! Here's a fun idea
for the game...

05:14.275 --> 05:17.136
- Oh God.
- Here we go.

05:17.137 --> 05:19.965
- What if, the...
- Dawwww!

05:23.206 --> 05:26.310
Awww! Why'd I wear
white jeans today?!?

05:30.241 --> 05:32.585
- Man... how come this place
is so crowded today?

05:32.586 --> 05:35.412
- Yeah.
Fooders is never this crowded.

05:35.413 --> 05:37.861
- Oh! I think it's 'cuz
of Michael Strahan.

05:37.862 --> 05:40.517
- Michael Strahan?
The guy?

05:42.275 --> 05:43.757
- Yeah, last week,
he was in here

05:43.758 --> 05:45.309
and he choked on a meatball...

05:45.310 --> 05:46.930
- And it was all over the news,

05:46.931 --> 05:48.240
so now everybody
wants to come eat here.

05:48.241 --> 05:50.034
- And take selfies
with the meatball.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.378
- I'm not gonna wait here
anymore!

05:55.379 --> 05:56.739
- Okay I'll...
- I want my table!!!

05:58.862 --> 06:00.309
- Hey guys.
How's everyone's food?

06:00.310 --> 06:01.619
- It's really good.
- It's delicious!

06:01.620 --> 06:02.757
- Great, time's up.

06:02.758 --> 06:06.240
- Hey!
- What are you doing?!?

06:06.241 --> 06:08.361
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Uh... It's not fair!

06:10.931 --> 06:13.067
- Hey buddy,
we weren't done eating.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.792
- Look, that guy
wants a table now,

06:15.793 --> 06:17.688
and he's a Wall Person.

06:17.689 --> 06:20.067
- Wha?
What's a Wall Person?

06:20.068 --> 06:23.378
- Ulch...

06:23.379 --> 06:25.447
"A Wall Person
is a special person

06:25.448 --> 06:28.309
whose photo is on the wall
at Fooders."

06:28.310 --> 06:30.517
See?

06:32.172 --> 06:33.930
- So, you're saying
that Wall People

06:33.931 --> 06:35.171
get a table whenever they want?

06:35.172 --> 06:37.171
- That's the rule.

06:37.172 --> 06:39.033
- Uh, and what else
do these "Wall People" get?

06:39.034 --> 06:40.930
- They don't have to
wear a shirt,

06:40.931 --> 06:42.586
and they get
the special ketchup.

06:49.586 --> 06:51.136
- Oh my God!

06:51.137 --> 06:52.826
This ketchup is heavenly.

06:52.827 --> 06:53.999
- I want my table!

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
- Alright guys.
Just get up!

06:55.001 --> 06:56.412
Get up! Go! Out!

06:56.413 --> 06:58.171
Go go go go go!

06:58.172 --> 07:01.517
- You can't just...
- What's your problem, man.

07:05.655 --> 07:09.585
- Hey, how do we
get to be on the wall?

07:09.586 --> 07:12.792
- Somebody who works here
has to think you're worthy.

07:12.793 --> 07:14.861
- Well are we worthy?

07:14.862 --> 07:16.517
- No. Bye.

07:19.068 --> 07:20.930
- Sir, thank you
for coming to Fooders.

07:20.931 --> 07:21.999
May I check your shirt?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.068
- You may.

07:27.965 --> 07:30.586
- Y'know, we weren't done
with our food.

07:32.758 --> 07:34.758
- Give 'em their food.

07:44.724 --> 07:46.688
- Man, that was
the first time in my life

07:46.689 --> 07:49.033
I've ever been asked
to leave a restaurant.

07:49.034 --> 07:50.654
- It was humiliating.

07:50.655 --> 07:52.240
- "Wall People." Pfftt.

07:52.241 --> 07:53.861
Y'know who should be
on that wall?

07:53.862 --> 07:56.895
- The Pope.

07:56.896 --> 08:00.654
- No. Not the Pope.

08:00.655 --> 08:03.516
Us!

08:03.517 --> 08:06.723
- You're right.
- Agreement.

08:06.724 --> 08:09.826
- Hey girl.
Hey girl!

08:09.827 --> 08:11.654
- Yeah?

08:11.655 --> 08:14.274
- Not 'posta eat food
on the subway.

08:14.275 --> 08:17.896
It's disgusting.

08:27.275 --> 08:28.861
- Hey! I know how
we can get our pics

08:28.862 --> 08:29.895
on the wall at Fooders.

08:29.896 --> 08:31.171
- How?
- You do?

08:31.172 --> 08:33.343
- We just get Double G
to ask for us.

08:33.344 --> 08:35.205
Hang on a sec...
- Oh yeeaahh.

08:35.206 --> 08:38.343
Famous people can
get anything done.

08:38.344 --> 08:40.758
- That's right.
Don't forget that.

08:46.620 --> 08:49.481
- Yeah, what? Oh!
Who's that, Babe? Hey!

08:49.482 --> 08:51.895
- Hey Dub.
We need you to do us a favor.

08:51.896 --> 08:53.309
- Nah nah nah nah.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.033
I don't like doin'
people favors.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.723
- No no, we just
need you to help us

08:56.724 --> 08:59.205
get our pics on the wall
at Fooders.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.585
- Awww!
Why do I have to help?

09:00.586 --> 09:02.343
- 'Cuz you're a big celebrity.

09:02.344 --> 09:04.309
- Yeah, but I uh, you know,

09:04.310 --> 09:07.757
I don't like usin' my fame
to get special treatment.

09:07.758 --> 09:09.102
- C'mon Dub!

09:09.103 --> 09:10.412
We're building you a llama game.

09:10.413 --> 09:12.102
So, just talk to the guy
at Fooders for us.

09:12.103 --> 09:15.930
- Ah, all right fine, whatever!

09:15.931 --> 09:17.964
Awww!!!
Ruthless!!!

09:17.965 --> 09:19.930
I told you to move
your big nasty funky foot!

09:19.931 --> 09:21.447
Move your nasty funky foot!

09:21.448 --> 09:24.517
Why is it still funky?
- I'm gonna end this now...

09:30.206 --> 09:32.826
- All right, who am I
supposed to talk to here?

09:32.827 --> 09:34.136
- Oh! Over there.

09:34.137 --> 09:38.206
- Hey dude... buddy...
over here?

09:40.344 --> 09:42.792
- Hey guys, we don't open
for lunch 'til noon.

09:42.793 --> 09:44.550
- I know.
I just brought my close friend

09:44.551 --> 09:46.067
and business partner here,

09:46.068 --> 09:48.102
'cuz he wants to talk to you.

09:48.103 --> 09:50.481
- Wassup, playboy?
- Hey, Double G.

09:50.482 --> 09:51.930
Big fan of your music.

09:51.931 --> 09:53.895
- Oh, I assumed that.

09:53.896 --> 09:55.240
Now, listen...

09:55.241 --> 09:57.861
Uh, my friend...
my girl, Babe here...

09:57.862 --> 09:59.447
Hahahahaha!

09:59.448 --> 10:01.861
I'd appreciate it if
you'd put a photo of her,

10:01.862 --> 10:04.481
and some of her associates,
up there on your wall.

10:04.482 --> 10:06.033
- Hey, for you, anything.

10:06.034 --> 10:08.102
- Ha ha, cool, cool.

10:08.103 --> 10:09.826
- I just need a...

10:09.827 --> 10:11.343
I just need a photo of her,
and her associates,

10:11.344 --> 10:12.688
that I can get framed...

10:12.689 --> 10:14.792
- Oh! I'm sorry,
did you say a framed photo?

10:14.793 --> 10:18.758
'Cuz I happen
to have one right here...

10:21.034 --> 10:22.067
y'know, if it helps.

10:22.068 --> 10:24.102
- He-heyyy, would look at that.

10:24.103 --> 10:26.412
- Yeah, that's...
that's perfect.

10:26.413 --> 10:28.344
Uh, All right,
well, let's see here...

10:35.827 --> 10:38.171
- B'hah! Hahahaha!

10:38.172 --> 10:40.102
Would you look?
Hahahahahaaha!

10:40.103 --> 10:42.309
- What's so funny?
- That. Ha ha!

10:42.310 --> 10:45.999
Man! I don't know
who that woman is...

10:46.000 --> 10:49.930
But when the ugly truck
was rollin' down the street,

10:49.931 --> 10:51.378
somebody forgot to yell

10:51.379 --> 10:54.310
"Hey! Move outta the way!"

10:57.931 --> 10:59.481
- What? What's up?

10:59.482 --> 11:02.067
- That woman is my mom.

11:02.068 --> 11:03.792
- Geez.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.965
- Oh! Uh, I-I do see
a family resemblance.

11:08.482 --> 11:10.826
Oh, I-I don't mean to
say that to be rude...

11:10.827 --> 11:14.723
'cuz look way better
than your momma.

11:14.724 --> 11:17.792
All right, well it's not like
she's UNattractive.

11:17.793 --> 11:22.274
Like if you were to
put her in a dark room...

11:22.275 --> 11:26.343
and then like,
turn the lights off...

11:26.344 --> 11:29.379
and not look directly
at her face...

11:30.620 --> 11:34.688
- Well, uh...
This has become awkward.

11:34.689 --> 11:36.758
I'ma go.

11:40.137 --> 11:42.654
- Uh, I don't even know him.

11:42.655 --> 11:44.965
- Ya know?
Wh... very awkward.

11:51.103 --> 11:52.447
- Hey! Where is he?

11:52.448 --> 11:53.999
Where's LeBron James?
LeBron!!!

11:54.000 --> 11:56.757
Bron Bron?
Are you here?

11:56.758 --> 11:59.033
- Trip, I'm sorry,
but LeBron's not here.

11:59.034 --> 12:01.481
- But Babe texted me and said,

12:01.482 --> 12:03.067
"Trip! Hurry!

12:03.068 --> 12:04.688
"LeBron James is
at Game Shakers,

12:04.689 --> 12:06.447
and he wants to be your friend!"

12:06.448 --> 12:09.033
See? It's right there.

12:09.034 --> 12:11.171
- Babe was lying.

12:11.172 --> 12:12.619
- What?!?

12:12.620 --> 12:14.240
- Well she knew you
wouldn't come here

12:14.241 --> 12:16.447
just 'cuz she wants to get
our pic on the wall at Fooders.

12:16.448 --> 12:20.067
- Awwww dang dang
d'dang dang it!

12:20.068 --> 12:23.688
I wanted to be LeBron's friend.

12:23.689 --> 12:26.309
- Hey! I'm back,
and I brought my guitar.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.999
- Good, let's go meet
Babe at Fooders.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.274
- Wait wait, I don't even

12:30.275 --> 12:32.999
- I'll explain on the way.
- D'awwwww...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.826
One minute, ya think you're

12:35.827 --> 12:38.412
then the next minute

12:38.413 --> 12:40.171
- Yeah... Hey!

12:40.172 --> 12:41.550
My grandfather knows

12:41.551 --> 12:44.240
on the Supreme Court.
Wanna meet her?

12:44.241 --> 12:45.930
- Nah, that's boring.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.965
- Yeah, I don't wanna'
meet her either.

12:55.034 --> 12:57.240
- Okay, go, go. Go.

12:57.241 --> 13:01.102

13:13.620 --> 13:18.826
So, raise your hand

13:18.827 --> 13:20.757
Okaaaay.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.481
Raise your hand if your
birthday is this week.

13:24.482 --> 13:27.688
Or this month.

13:27.689 --> 13:29.826
Who's got a birthday this month?

13:29.827 --> 13:34.516

14:38.000 --> 14:39.447

to get our photo
on the wall here.

14:42.517 --> 14:44.102
- Yeah man!

14:44.103 --> 14:45.895
- Oh, you're gonna get your
pics on the wall.

14:45.896 --> 14:48.068
The wall of people who
are banned from eating here.

14:52.068 --> 14:53.654
- Aw no no no noooo.

14:53.655 --> 14:56.447
- You can't put us up there
with those monsters!

14:56.448 --> 14:58.033
- Seriously dude.

14:58.034 --> 14:59.930
- We spend a lotta money
in this place.

14:59.931 --> 15:02.481
- This is where we come to
brainstorm ideas for our games.

15:02.482 --> 15:05.654
- Pffft.
You speak of games.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.412
What "games"?

15:07.413 --> 15:08.688
- Mobile games.

15:08.689 --> 15:10.136
- That we make at Game Shakers.

15:10.137 --> 15:13.171
- Wait... you guys
work at Game Shakers?

15:13.172 --> 15:16.171
- We are the Game Shakers.

15:16.172 --> 15:19.205
- Oh my God.

15:19.206 --> 15:21.792
- Hey, can I get a to-go box
for my birthday cake?

15:21.793 --> 15:22.793
- You get nothing!

15:27.206 --> 15:28.620
- The system is rigged!

15:31.413 --> 15:32.688
- You, come with me...

15:32.689 --> 15:34.516

15:34.517 --> 15:35.688
Quick, quick quick quick...

15:35.689 --> 15:37.723
All right, what what?

15:37.724 --> 15:39.999
- Listen to me.
- 'Kay...

15:40.000 --> 15:41.516
- All right.
There's this girl...

15:41.517 --> 15:42.792
I met her online,

15:42.793 --> 15:44.619
and I really want her
to like me.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.171
- Y-yeah, I don't know
what to tell ya.

15:47.172 --> 15:48.964
- She's way into gaming.

15:48.965 --> 15:50.792
And if she thinks I work
at some place cool place

15:50.793 --> 15:53.343
like Game Shakers,
that'll totally impress her.

15:53.344 --> 15:55.861
- I just want my pic
on the wall.

15:55.862 --> 15:58.861
- C'mon just lemme pretend
I work there.

15:58.862 --> 16:00.654
- And then you'll put
the Game Shakers on the wall?

16:00.655 --> 16:01.930
And NOT the wall of monsters?

16:01.931 --> 16:03.516
- Yep. And then you guys

16:03.517 --> 16:05.481
can get a table here
whenever you want.

16:05.482 --> 16:06.964
- What about
the special ketchup?

16:06.965 --> 16:09.102
Do we get the special ketchup?
- Promise.

16:09.103 --> 16:11.310
I'll even squirt it
on your food for you.

16:14.310 --> 16:15.724
- Yeah, we don't want that.

16:20.862 --> 16:23.274
- And I was bored last night,
sooo...

16:23.275 --> 16:25.481
I created this little guy.

16:25.482 --> 16:26.723
- What is that?

16:26.724 --> 16:29.895
- Tommy the Llama.

16:29.896 --> 16:32.516
- W-why is he wearing pants?

16:32.517 --> 16:35.930
- I dunno.
Why do any of us wear pants?

16:35.931 --> 16:38.000
- That's pretty deep.

16:41.620 --> 16:44.792
- Hey Shakers of Games!
Look what we got!

16:44.793 --> 16:48.378
Hint: It's a llama.

16:48.379 --> 16:50.619
- Oh wow.
- Whoa, look at him!

16:50.620 --> 16:53.585
- He's adorable.
- What's his name?

16:53.586 --> 16:57.000
- Barack.
- Barack O'Llama.

16:58.103 --> 16:59.792

16:59.793 --> 17:02.102
- Yes we do.
- We get it.

17:02.103 --> 17:03.516
- Why'd you bring him here?

17:03.517 --> 17:05.757
- 'Cuz he spit on Dub.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.826
- Yeah. So my dad was all,

17:07.827 --> 17:10.999
"Trip! Get this nasty
llama outta my hot tub

17:11.000 --> 17:14.102
'til he learns some respect!"

17:14.103 --> 17:16.447
- Wait, I thought llamas
only spit when they're angry.

17:16.448 --> 17:18.964
- Awwww, poor little llama.

17:18.965 --> 17:22.136
Did Double G make you mad...

17:22.137 --> 17:25.447

17:34.275 --> 17:35.723

17:35.724 --> 17:36.792
She didn't get here yet,
did she?

17:36.793 --> 17:38.792
- Who?
- Meesha.

17:38.793 --> 17:41.861
My online girlfriend

17:41.862 --> 17:43.688
- Yeah, we uh,

17:43.689 --> 17:45.757
- Okay.
Good good good.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.550
Okay so, she should
arrive any second.

17:47.551 --> 17:49.205
And when she walks in,

17:49.206 --> 17:51.447
you guys just pretend
like I'm one of your co-workers.

17:51.448 --> 17:53.309
- Yep.
- Perfect.

17:53.310 --> 17:55.171
- As long as you still
promise to put us

17:55.172 --> 17:57.136
on the wall at Fooders
and give us a table

17:57.137 --> 17:59.550
and special ketchup
whenever we want.

17:59.551 --> 18:02.827
- Word is bond.

18:07.344 --> 18:08.654
Oh geez, it's her!

- SILENCE!

18:38.413 --> 18:39.757
I'm sorry.

18:39.758 --> 18:41.826
Sometimes my employees
can be rude.

18:41.827 --> 18:43.930
- It's okay.
- Employees?

18:43.931 --> 18:45.240
- Hey look dude,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.378
- Not act like our "boss."

19:03.379 --> 19:05.033

20:18.413 --> 20:20.206
I came to apologize

20:21.586 --> 20:24.550

20:24.551 --> 20:26.930
- Dub, please go home.

20:26.931 --> 20:28.412

20:28.413 --> 20:30.102

He's just a scummy waiter.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.723

20:59.724 --> 21:02.999
- Ehh...

21:03.000 --> 21:06.343
- Yeah. It's true.

21:06.344 --> 21:09.447
I don't work here
at Game Shakers.

21:09.448 --> 21:12.723
I'm just a scummy waiter,
at Fooders.

21:12.724 --> 21:15.343
I'm sorry I lied to you.

21:15.344 --> 21:19.343
I... I don't care
