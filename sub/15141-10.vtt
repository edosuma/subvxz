I'm sorry I've been
so stressed out lately.

11:24.191 --> 11:27.862
I hate when things

Now?

13:33.053 --> 13:35.189
It's important.

13:35.255 --> 13:37.057
I'll be back.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.031
What do you want, Camila?

13:56.310 --> 13:57.811
You're lying.

You're using Amber
to get my attention?

14:00.280 --> 14:02.883
Wow, that's really screwed up.
Even for you.

14:02.950 --> 14:05.019
