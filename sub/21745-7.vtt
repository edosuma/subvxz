WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.337
You jerk.
It's not funny.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.339
Yes, it is.
Stop it!

00:05.373 --> 00:07.408
(running footsteps)
(door slams)

00:07.441 --> 00:10.744
ANNOUNCER: Better Things.
All new Thursdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.081 --> 00:16.750
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.690
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

00:22.723 --> 00:24.992
Hi.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.760
I need a car.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.129
Mr. Collins?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.165
Gretchen?

00:31.199 --> 00:32.433
(chuckles)

00:32.466 --> 00:33.834
Hiya.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.003
Wow. Look at you.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.772
Look at... you.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.175
My, oh, my.
You're so grown-up.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.078
I always wondered how your face
would fill out.

00:44.112 --> 00:47.014
You get these students sometimes
and they just don't look

00:47.047 --> 00:48.949
like high school kids.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.684
Every new semester you see

00:50.718 --> 00:54.288
one or two that look more like
unformed adults.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.724
So, what's the haps?

00:56.757 --> 00:59.393
You ever become
a marine biologist?

00:59.427 --> 01:02.096
Yes, actually.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.798
I'm at the
University of Santa Barbara.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.735
I'm a professor emeritus
of cephalopod study.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.971
I basically just play
with octopuses all day.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.573
Don't you mean octopi?

01:12.606 --> 01:15.809
-No, we changed it back
to octopuses. -(phone rings)

01:15.843 --> 01:17.411
Hi, Daddy.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.979
Hi, honey.
Where are you?

01:19.012 --> 01:20.948
On the plane.
We just landed.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.816
Good. Melody's doing fine.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.286
Her cervix is only
four centimeters.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.954
That's one tiny cervix.
(chuckles)

01:26.987 --> 01:29.323
No, no. I meant th-that's
how much it's dilated.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.058
Yes, I know. I-I was joking.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.926
-It was just a little...
-Anyway, listen.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.163
I need you to stop by the house
and get my eye drops.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.797
And don't forget Banshee.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.467
Right. And don't forget
to feed Banshee.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.001
Banshee's still alive?

01:41.034 --> 01:44.138
-Are you deplaning yet?
-Excuse me, miss.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.140
Do you need help getting
your bag down?

01:46.174 --> 01:47.475
Yeah, I should go.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.343
All right, we'll see you soon.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.014
So, you stopped teaching?

01:54.047 --> 01:56.417
Oh, yup, yup.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.951
Retired.

01:57.985 --> 02:00.788
Oh. Ah.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.692
Now, Gretchen,

02:04.725 --> 02:07.828
can I tell you about our
award-winning coverage package?

02:07.861 --> 02:09.463
I'll take all of it.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.031
MR. COLLINS:
Shoot.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.866
Looks like all of our
standard vehicles are out.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.035
I'll just take whatever you got.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.772
So...

02:18.806 --> 02:20.608
How long are you in town?

02:20.641 --> 02:22.643
-*
-(plane passes overhead)

02:24.878 --> 02:27.881
*

02:29.650 --> 02:32.820
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:32.853 --> 02:35.823
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:35.856 --> 02:37.258
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.366
*

02:51.038 --> 02:53.707
* You might come around

02:55.743 --> 02:58.679
* Someday

02:58.712 --> 03:00.180
* Transmissions

03:00.214 --> 03:03.351
* I've found

03:03.384 --> 03:06.153
* Fading

03:06.186 --> 03:08.188
*

03:15.062 --> 03:18.165
* From old tapes we made

03:18.198 --> 03:20.067
* Ooh

03:20.100 --> 03:21.869
* A picture

03:21.902 --> 03:23.337
(cat mews)

03:23.371 --> 03:25.873
* That opens the same

03:25.906 --> 03:27.174
-* Ooh
-(cat mews)

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
* It's all right

03:29.076 --> 03:31.912
Hi, Banshee.

03:31.945 --> 03:35.349
* They get lost
in the troposphere *

03:35.383 --> 03:37.117
*

03:38.619 --> 03:40.087
* Days go by

03:40.120 --> 03:41.955
* And I dream of it

03:41.989 --> 03:44.758
*

03:44.792 --> 03:47.895
* In the new year

03:47.928 --> 03:51.299
* I'll come around

03:51.332 --> 03:53.567
* In the new year

03:57.070 --> 03:58.906
(grunts)

03:59.840 --> 04:01.542
* Forms in my view

04:01.575 --> 04:03.977
(sighs)

04:04.011 --> 04:07.247
* They're changing

04:07.281 --> 04:11.552
* From the ones that I knew

04:11.585 --> 04:13.721
(coughs)

04:13.754 --> 04:15.789
* To display

04:15.823 --> 04:18.592
* Everything slow

04:18.626 --> 04:20.594
* Ooh

04:23.831 --> 04:25.966
* Or the pressure below

04:25.999 --> 04:29.437
* Ooh

04:31.772 --> 04:36.076
* They get lost
in the troposphere *

04:36.109 --> 04:39.447
*

04:39.480 --> 04:42.316
* Days go by and I dream of it

04:42.350 --> 04:45.252
*

04:45.285 --> 04:48.989
* In the new year

04:49.022 --> 04:51.992
* I'll come around

04:52.025 --> 04:54.528
* In the new year

04:54.562 --> 04:56.564
*

04:59.032 --> 05:00.334
(tapping keys)

05:00.368 --> 05:03.471
* I'll come around

05:03.504 --> 05:05.973
* In the new year...

05:17.651 --> 05:21.088
Holy shit. You didn't die?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.995
(indistinct chatter)

05:29.930 --> 05:32.332
*

05:36.504 --> 05:38.572
Hey!

05:54.555 --> 05:56.557
(both laugh)

06:05.399 --> 06:09.102
-You've really never been
to L.A.? -Nope.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.672
Who hasn't been to L.A.?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.441
I don't like the sunshine.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.175
Why, because of the cancer?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.579
What? No. Just...

06:18.612 --> 06:20.013
Yeah, maybe.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.415
Never thought of that.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.716
You should come.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.051
It's great.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.886
The tacos are like...

06:25.919 --> 06:28.956
It's insane.
I can't even get into it.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.059
It's great you did this.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.527
I remember we always
used to talk

06:33.561 --> 06:35.028
about taking over this place.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.196
No, we didn't.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.565
Are you kidding? Yeah, we did.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.099
Like, all the time.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.301
Buy the roller rink,
make it cool.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.371
Make sure Dana Miller
can never go in, bitch.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.440
I don't remember that.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.942
Last year the owner died, and
they were gonna tear it down,

06:48.976 --> 06:51.879
and I had money from my grandma,
so I just...

06:51.912 --> 06:53.447
Anyway, I'm so in debt.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.982
It's not what I thought.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.283
DEEJAY (over speaker):
All right, everybody.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.152
It's dance skate time!

06:59.186 --> 07:00.954
If you're not ready
to shake your booty

07:00.988 --> 07:03.056
like it did you wrong,

07:03.090 --> 07:04.825
-clear the floor.
-Uh, excuse me, no.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.560
You're staying.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.496
No. Seriously. I'll just wait
right over there.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.097
No. Seriously.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.299
*

07:21.174 --> 07:23.276
(female singer vocalizing)

07:29.883 --> 07:31.885
*

07:34.622 --> 07:36.590
* Boy

07:36.624 --> 07:39.292
* If you knew

07:39.326 --> 07:43.330
* Just how I feel

07:43.363 --> 07:44.665
* When we meet

07:44.698 --> 07:45.933
* With our heads

07:45.966 --> 07:48.101
* Up in the stars

07:48.135 --> 07:50.871
* Oh, oh

07:50.904 --> 07:52.940
-* Dance
-(whooping)

07:52.973 --> 07:54.474
* Don't cry

07:54.508 --> 07:57.477
(whooping)

07:57.511 --> 07:59.780
*

07:59.813 --> 08:01.982
(whooping)

08:07.354 --> 08:09.456
What happened?
You were so sick when I left.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.660
Mm, operations, five in all.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.729
Coupled with the numerous rounds
of chemo. Mm.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.365
Science is good.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.333
So, college and then...

08:20.367 --> 08:21.869
Why did you move back here?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.303
I like it here.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.739
Anyway, my family's here.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.308
-That's exactly why I don't
live here. -(phone rings)

08:28.341 --> 08:30.010
Hello?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.979
It's Dad. Where are you?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.548
It's been a total disaster.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.550
They lost my bags,
and then I got home,

08:36.584 --> 08:39.252
and you're out of cat food,
and Banshee bit me.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.989
GRETCHEN'S FATHER: Really?
Sorry. We've been so busy.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.157
It's okay, Daddy.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.595
Anyway, I am just
on my way to the store now.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.830
-I will be there soon.
-Okay, so...

08:49.863 --> 08:51.865
(phone beeps, clicks)

08:53.934 --> 08:58.238
Heidi, this place
is just so amazing.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.107
You should do special events.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.410
You should do Eggs and Porn.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.679
-What?
-Eggs and Porn.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.280
You serve breakfast,

09:07.314 --> 09:09.750
and also, there's retro porn
playing on the TVs.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.619
It's really kitschy and fun.
Plus, the posters

09:11.652 --> 09:14.387
are really easy because
fried eggs look like boobs.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.557
You realize children are
a big part of our clientele?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.292
Just put the TVs up high.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.895
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the rink is now closed.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.064
-Please return your skates...
-We should go to our mall!

09:24.097 --> 09:25.899
Our mall died.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.635
-What?!
-Apparently, it's just

09:27.668 --> 09:30.971
stray dogs, meth heads
and teens partying now.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.373
(gasps)

09:33.406 --> 09:37.444
-GRETCHEN: This is so sad.
-(train whistle blowing)

09:37.477 --> 09:40.547
Our mall is dead.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.817
-HEIDI: Do you buy everything
online now? -Totally.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.387
Then this is your fault.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.323
GRETCHEN:
It is kind of beautiful.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.492
(water dripping)

09:52.525 --> 09:54.594
This is crazy!

09:54.628 --> 09:56.730
I know.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.800
-First got my ears pierced
over there. -(distant thudding)

09:59.833 --> 10:02.770
I first got fingered
in that dressing room.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.572
Mm. (laughs)

10:05.605 --> 10:07.407
-(indistinct chatter)
-Yeah.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.577
-'Sup, shorties?
-TEEN BOY: Hello.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.480
Anyways,
it's just a rip-off that our

10:13.513 --> 10:15.849
-so-called advisors don't have
any... -We used to shop here.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.618
Cool.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.287
You meth heads?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.690
No, we're j-juniors.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.124
Gross.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.625
Where's your booze?

10:25.659 --> 10:27.695
We're just hanging out.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.596
(Gretchen laughs)

10:29.629 --> 10:31.298
(bottles clinking)

10:31.331 --> 10:33.701
-(indistinct chatter)
-(Gretchen sighs)

10:37.170 --> 10:39.572
(Gretchen sighs)

10:43.543 --> 10:45.012
Mm. (guttural gasp)

10:45.045 --> 10:46.613
Okay.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.849
I'm officially
in sense memory overload.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.621
So... what?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.623
You're living here.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.492
Roommates? Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.695
There isn't much.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.631
I write a little, bike a lot.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.400
Try and keep the rink afloat,
mostly.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.036
Yeah, but you're doing it.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.738
You know,
the whole big-fish thing?

11:10.771 --> 11:14.307
I have that urge sometimes,
just to pack it all in.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.710
What do you have there
that's so different?

11:16.744 --> 11:18.478
I already told you
about the tacos, right?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.613
(laughs)

11:21.915 --> 11:24.584
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.387
It was a long time ago.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.257
I should have come
to the hospital, though.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.192
Oh, I forgot to tell you!

11:32.225 --> 11:34.227
Guess who is working

11:34.261 --> 11:37.898
at the car rental agency
at the airport.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.833
Mr. Collins!

11:39.867 --> 11:42.169
He watches all
my Instagram stories.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.771
He's so creepy.

11:43.804 --> 11:47.674
You, uh, know why
he got fired, right?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.277
-No.
-He was caught

11:50.310 --> 11:52.012
taking up-skirt shots
of students.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.081
He posted 'em
on the "Panty Sluts" subreddit.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.184
-Gross!
-Oh, I knew something was up!

11:57.217 --> 12:01.588
Uh, hey, you guys have
a dead mall. You're wasting it

12:01.621 --> 12:04.424
-by not drinking. -Thanks
for the advice. -(scoffs)

12:04.457 --> 12:06.794
That wasn't technically advice.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.862
GRETCHEN:
She owns the skating rink so if

12:08.896 --> 12:10.697
you're mean to her,
you can never skate.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.232
You're banned for life.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.801
HEIDI:
Yeah!

12:13.834 --> 12:16.069
You're not banned.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.470
What are two
30-year-old women doing

12:17.504 --> 12:18.806
hanging out with high schoolers?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.640
Okay, now you're banned!

12:20.673 --> 12:23.110
(train whistle blowing)

12:23.143 --> 12:26.146
Wait. We have
that A.P. History essay.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.048
(speaking gibberish mockingly)

12:28.081 --> 12:29.649
Don't be a pussy.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.118
Aw, shit!

12:31.151 --> 12:32.786
-Oh!
-Colin!

12:42.429 --> 12:44.297
I don't understand what we're
expected to do. You raised us

12:44.331 --> 12:47.000
to need the constant feedback
that comes from this.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.668
We didn't raise shit, sucka! Oh!

12:48.701 --> 12:50.503
TEEN GIRL:
It's the marketers.

12:50.537 --> 12:54.307
It's just to get us addicted
so they can advertise to us.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.743
And that's why I purposefully
don't buy anything

12:56.776 --> 12:58.445
that they advertise to me.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.348
You saw Deadpool,
like, five times.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.684
See? Then I fell for it, too.
I'm no better.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.587
-It's just really stressful.
-It's so stressful.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.290
-It really is.
-Oh, my God!

13:10.323 --> 13:13.026
-Ugh!
-(bottle shatters)

13:13.060 --> 13:15.595
You guys are
the worst teens ever!

13:15.628 --> 13:17.931
This can't be
what you're all like.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.300
Come on. Truth or dare?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.601
-Dare. -(skateboard rolls,
bottle clinks)

13:21.634 --> 13:24.872
Kiss that one.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.551
You cool?

13:45.558 --> 13:46.559
Ah.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.061
(Heidi laughs)

13:48.095 --> 13:49.963
(Gretchen laughs airily)

13:49.997 --> 13:52.299
M-My turn!
Truth or dare?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.667
GRETCHEN:
No, you guys aren't playing.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.803
Why did you let her do that?

13:56.836 --> 14:00.740
Guys, you know
this is the best time, right?

14:00.773 --> 14:04.377
It is all downhill
from here, for real!

14:04.411 --> 14:06.213
I mean, you do get hotter

14:06.246 --> 14:08.515
and get to do or eat whatever
you want-- and that's awesome--

14:08.548 --> 14:11.418
but things are new right now,

14:11.451 --> 14:14.687
-and you feel things so hard,
-(punches hand)

14:14.721 --> 14:17.824
and that is beautiful!

14:17.857 --> 14:21.694
Grown-up stuff sucks,
is what I'm saying.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.996
(train whistle blowing)

14:23.030 --> 14:26.766
Um, can I have a... a cigarette?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.108
What's your name?

14:35.142 --> 14:36.576
Rosemary Felton.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.381
I'm Haley... Wallish.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.517
Wait. Are you related
to Darius Wallish?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.386
That's my dad.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.222
Your dad? Darius is your dad?
Are you kidding?

14:49.256 --> 14:50.723
You know him?

14:50.757 --> 14:53.426
(gasping)
I was his senior prom date

14:53.460 --> 14:56.363
when I was a freshman! Uh.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.698
We totally fu...

14:58.731 --> 15:01.901
I had...
fun dancing with your father.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.771
(laughing):
We... danced.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.139
(laughing)

15:06.173 --> 15:07.907
Like three times.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.277
-(laughter)
-What?

15:10.310 --> 15:13.380
Well, three and a half.
We hand-danced in the car.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.950
(laughter)

15:16.984 --> 15:21.488
-Why are you laughing?
-(laughter continues)

15:24.091 --> 15:25.959
HEIDI:
You always give the best braids.

15:25.993 --> 15:29.129
My aunt taught me. She moved
to Europe when I was eight.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.432
-I was devastated.
-I remember.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.267
I cried so hard.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.903
Cried and cried.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.506
You were patient with me.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.411
(Heidi sighs)

15:44.444 --> 15:46.413
(Gretchen sighs)

15:46.446 --> 15:49.749
Mr. Collins said
he always used to wonder

15:49.782 --> 15:52.119
what some students would
look like when they grew up,

15:52.152 --> 15:53.953
like, when they were
a real person.

15:53.987 --> 15:58.125
-I wonder if he ever up-skirted
me. -Now I know what he meant.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.860
It's so nice to see you older,

16:00.893 --> 16:03.663
to see what you ended up
looking like.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.333
It's nice to see tiny wrinkles.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.668
Gee, thanks.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.804
No. It's good. It is!

16:11.838 --> 16:15.142
You lived long enough
to get wrinkles.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.377
I have something for you.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.788
Aw, remember
your mom's Snickerdoodles?

16:28.821 --> 16:32.159
Remember when something like
cinnamon could make you happy?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.861
Cinnamon still makes me happy.
(inhales deeply)

16:34.894 --> 16:37.530
I have cinnamon toast
all the time.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.332
How?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.401
I just make it.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.902
You make it?

16:42.935 --> 16:44.637
It's just sugar

16:44.671 --> 16:47.140
and cinnamon, Gretchen.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.209
Yeah, but how do you know
how to buy cinnamon?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.843
Are you serious?

16:50.877 --> 16:52.512
Uh, yeah.
Who knows that?

16:52.545 --> 16:53.980
Cinnamon?
(scoffs)

16:54.013 --> 16:55.382
Is there a spice store?

16:55.415 --> 16:56.983
Does it come in sticks?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.319
Do you have to grind it up
like a frontiers lady?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.853
Don't be stupid.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.756
I mean, Jesus.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.558
You're an adult.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.528
-Jesus.
-Well, it's true.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.697
COLIN:
Uh, just so you know--

17:10.730 --> 17:14.267
I've had sex.
Like... the big kind.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.069
-Yeah?
-Good for you.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.380
Tell you what.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.051
If you eat this entire
can of cat food,

17:32.085 --> 17:33.920
I will suck your dick.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.223
You made a deal.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.758
COLIN:
She's right.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.594
You made a deal.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.129
Do you have another can?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.103
Okay, then.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.095
-(door slams open) -(gasps)
-Police! Everyone hold still.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.430
-Shit!
-Get your hands up!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.999
Don't make any sudden moves!

18:53.032 --> 18:55.502
-Colin! -Which way do we go?
-I don't know!

18:55.535 --> 18:57.670
-HEIDI: That way! -OFFICER: Hey,
come back... Come here!

18:57.704 --> 19:00.373
-(shrieking)
-(shouting)

19:00.407 --> 19:01.641
*

19:01.674 --> 19:02.975
-(engine starts)
-(Gretchen panting)

19:03.009 --> 19:05.011
(engine revs, tires squeal)

19:09.416 --> 19:11.218
(siren wailing)

19:11.251 --> 19:12.619
Whose siren is that?

19:12.652 --> 19:14.387
Can you see him?

19:14.421 --> 19:18.057
No. But I think
he's following us somehow.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.792
-Shit!
-(engine revving)

19:19.826 --> 19:21.561
Just pull over!

19:21.594 --> 19:22.695
I have a record!

19:36.343 --> 19:38.678
(siren continues wailing)

19:46.185 --> 19:48.255
Okay.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.289
(screams)

19:50.557 --> 19:51.591
(both panting)

19:51.624 --> 19:54.193
(engine stops)

20:01.268 --> 20:03.270
(ignition sputters)

20:12.979 --> 20:15.315
Well, Mr. Collins pressured me
to take full coverage.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.993
Goddamn pervert.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.601
(yells)

20:36.235 --> 20:37.370
(laughs)

20:37.404 --> 20:39.038
GRETCHEN:
Those kids--

20:39.071 --> 20:41.207
I mean, yeah,

20:41.240 --> 20:42.875
they were puking their guts out

20:42.909 --> 20:45.478
or eating cat food for BJs,

20:45.512 --> 20:47.447
but they were just
hanging out together,

20:47.480 --> 20:49.115
and that was enough.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.217
That used to be enough.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.953
Boy, I got off track somewhere.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.894
I was thinking I move back and
we run the roller rink together.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.763
Don't say anything, but...

21:03.796 --> 21:05.632
I'm serious.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.935
I probably have a new niece
or nephew by now, and...

21:08.968 --> 21:11.804
our family cat is not
gonna be around forever.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.440
Don't move back here, Gretchen.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.976
No, I know. But it's not
out of desperation. I want to.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.811
Well, I don't want you to.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.414
Is it because I ghosted you

21:21.448 --> 21:22.982
in high school?
We talked about that.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.818
You didn't ghost me.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.920
Uh, I did.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.089
Well, you might have,

21:30.122 --> 21:32.325
I just wasn't aware of it.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.762
Gretchen, we weren't
friends then.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.431
Well, maybe we weren't as...

21:38.465 --> 21:40.533
day-to-day close,

21:40.567 --> 21:42.469
but we were absolutely friends.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.371
I have a picture.
You were all cancery.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.706
That was when I came back
the first time.

21:46.739 --> 21:50.042
Everyone wanted a piece
of that sweet cancer action.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.311
I took photos with everyone.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.980
The reason you never
came to the hospital

21:54.013 --> 21:56.182
is because I never
invited you.

21:56.215 --> 21:59.318
I don't even know what
you're talking about here.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.554
We weren't friends
after eighth grade.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.890
You became a shape-shifter.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.224
A what?

22:05.257 --> 22:07.026
I know you had family shit

22:07.059 --> 22:09.061
and you couldn't
be yourself around them,

22:09.095 --> 22:10.497
but you'd straight-up
act like someone different

22:10.530 --> 22:12.131
depending on who you were with,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.133
then pretty soon
there's no real Gretchen.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.068
We'd be best friends on Friday

22:16.102 --> 22:18.738
and on the Monday
you'd look right through me.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.141
You're just not a great bet
to invest too deeply in.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.143
Everyone liked you
or wanted you,

22:24.176 --> 22:26.312
but no one knew you.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.048
Well...

22:29.081 --> 22:30.583
I mean...

22:30.617 --> 22:34.053
-(sprinklers spraying)
-(clears throat)

22:34.086 --> 22:36.355
I mean, do you
want to know me now?

22:37.690 --> 22:40.159
I made a life.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.029
I'm happy.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.064
I think no, Gretchen.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.935
Not really.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.214
Hey!

23:02.248 --> 23:04.917
You owe me half the profits
of the roller rink!

23:04.951 --> 23:06.786
That was our dream!

23:06.819 --> 23:08.555
And just so you know,

23:08.588 --> 23:11.090
I was never serious
about moving back here!

23:11.123 --> 23:12.559
Piece of shit town!

23:12.592 --> 23:15.227
