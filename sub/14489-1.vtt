yourself a beverage machine?

02:28.650 --> 02:30.485
I call myself Bev.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.263
I was wondering who
Shrekked in the toilet.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.433
I hope you're

you where robot babies come from?

12:08.979 --> 12:11.315
Daddy, how'd you get
so good at bending?

12:11.815 --> 12:14.318
I inherited my arm control
software from my mom.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.737
That's how it's passed down,
mother to son.

12:17.029 --> 12:19.156
But my mommy had no arms!

12:19.698 --> 12:21.992
Does that mean
I can never be a bender?

12:22.284 --> 12:23.577
Well, sure you can!
You just need

12:23.661 --> 12:25.162
to get a
bending card installed.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.500
I hate to crush a boy's
dreams, but what the heck.

12:29.875 --> 12:34.171
He has only one expansion slot,
and it holds his memory card.

12:34.672 --> 12:37.091
This robot will never bend.

12:37.841 --> 12:40.761
Don't tell my son
what he can and can't do!

12:41.220 --> 12:42.596
You may know
what's in his head,

12:42.680 --> 12:44.348
but you don't know
what's in his heart!

12:45.349 --> 12:47.268
There's no slot
in there, either.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.352
I said shut up!

12:54.525 --> 12:59.530
Today marks young Ben's 13th day
of being left on continuously.

13:00.197 --> 13:04.159
And so, before the Lord
and this congregation,

13:04.618 --> 13:09.164
we upgrade him to man-bot.
Can I get a mazel tov?

13:09.665 --> 13:10.833
ALL: Mazel tov!

13:10.916 --> 13:11.959
Mazel tov!

13:12.543 --> 13:15.087
I'd like to thank the
preacher-bot for the introduction

13:15.296 --> 13:18.340
and also for not circumcising
me again, am I right?

My mom may have
abandoned me,

13:29.893 --> 13:32.688
but I have the greatest dad
in the whole universe.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.525

to show his emotions...

13:37.151 --> 13:38.193
Don't look at me!

13:38.402 --> 13:40.904
...and someday,
if my dreams come true,

13:41.155 --> 13:43.032
I'll be a bender,
just like him.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.909
You must be
so proud of your boy.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.203

or leave him.
