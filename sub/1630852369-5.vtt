00:15.148 --> 00:16.147
- Because you passed the bar,

00:16.216 --> 00:18.550
I want to throw a party.
- Do I have to come?

00:18.618 --> 00:20.086
- Yes, you have to come.

00:20.152 --> 00:22.554
- I don't know where
my husband's at right now.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.092
- You'll find him,
he'll surface.

00:26.158 --> 00:29.228
And it'll all--
It'll all work out.

00:29.295 --> 00:32.531
- My life is falling apart.

00:32.599 --> 00:34.132
- I was thinking about Noella.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.601
She was just kind of
condescending to me

00:35.603 --> 00:36.802
at the party.
- Oh, she did?

00:36.869 --> 00:38.338
- I don't like mean girls.

00:38.404 --> 00:40.105
- Hi!
- Hi, Noella, how are you?

00:42.609 --> 00:44.409
- Yeah, great.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.479
- How's it going?
- How are you?

00:46.546 --> 00:48.114
- Shannon, she said

00:48.180 --> 00:51.817
that Nicole had sued
your husband.

00:51.884 --> 00:55.187
- You shouldn't have said
anything.

00:55.254 --> 00:57.355
- I want to do whatever I can

00:57.423 --> 00:59.758
to make it up to you.
I feel horrible.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.427
<i>[tense music]</i>

01:02.495 --> 01:04.230
- My turn?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08.968 --> 01:12.138
- If you ever come after me

01:12.204 --> 01:15.640
or my family ever again,

01:15.708 --> 01:18.643
you are going to lose a lot more

01:18.711 --> 01:21.280
than just my friendship.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.648
This will cost a lot.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.517
And I'm not saying this
as a threat,

01:25.585 --> 01:27.286
I'm saying it as a promise.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.324
- Okay.
- I will defend my family

01:32.391 --> 01:33.659
to the end.

01:36.462 --> 01:37.663
I thought you and I were good,

01:37.665 --> 01:40.032
and it was just, like,
a big (BLEEP) you.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.535
- It felt, I'm sure,
devastating.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.270
Like, it's horrible.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.473
I'm--I am horrified
about all of this.

01:48.475 --> 01:49.609
- I'm just being honest.

01:49.675 --> 01:53.479
I don't know
that I trust you 100%,

01:53.546 --> 01:56.348
but I am willing to forgive you.

01:56.415 --> 02:00.119
- I--I--I screwed up.
Because I'm a loyal friend.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.221
I made a lot of lapses
of judgements,

02:03.289 --> 02:04.890
and I apologize for that.

02:04.892 --> 02:08.259
<i>Shannon is not crying
because she feels bad.</i>

02:08.328 --> 02:11.296
Shannon is not crying
because she has remorse.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.465
Shannon is crying
because she got caught.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.569
- I made a huge mistake.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.705
And I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.473
I appreciate that.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.175
Don't ----ing fail me.
- I'm not going to.

02:24.177 --> 02:27.712
I'm not going to.
[laughs]

02:27.780 --> 02:29.448
I'm not.
- That--I'm serious.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.283
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.652
<i>- When Heather and I
first got to know each other,</i>

02:32.718 --> 02:33.986
<i>it was very difficult,</i>

02:34.053 --> 02:35.420
as I wasn't used to

02:35.488 --> 02:38.357
ever getting kicked out
of a home before.

02:38.424 --> 02:39.658
Check that one off the box.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.761
- You know what, you know--
- My children are in the house.

02:41.827 --> 02:43.728
We're done. Please leave.

02:43.796 --> 02:46.464
I'm asking you to leave.

02:46.532 --> 02:48.900
- Okay, wow. Wow.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.304
<i>Heather and I worked
through our rough start,</i>

02:51.370 --> 02:53.872
and, you know, at this point,
only time is gonna tell.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.207
She threatened me,
she said she's okay with it.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.609
Let's see.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.679
- I need you
to apologize to my husband.

03:02.815 --> 03:05.217
- I--I want to. I'm going to.

03:05.284 --> 03:06.185
- I think
that would be appropriate.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.486
- Okay.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.620
- Let me go see
if I can grab him.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.722
- Okay, all right. Okay.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.624
Now I gotta sit down
and talk to Terry.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.193
<i>And she's gonna sit there
and listen.</i>

03:14.261 --> 03:16.561
<i>I feel like Heather
is my schoolteacher</i>

03:16.563 --> 03:17.696
<i>grading me,</i>

03:17.764 --> 03:20.199
and I'm a ----ing
57-year-old woman.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.900
- I met with you
at your surgery center

03:21.968 --> 03:23.169
with J!
- You met with me?

03:23.236 --> 03:24.469
- Yeah.
- Well, it's hard to--

03:24.471 --> 03:25.370
Hey, now.
- Sorry, can I borrow you

03:25.438 --> 03:26.571
for one sec?
- Yes.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.106
- Excuse me, one second.
- Sorry, we're talking shop.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.208
- Sorry, Jen.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.243
Shannon wants to apologize
but not in front of people.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.378
- Okay, good.

03:33.446 --> 03:36.514
- Hi, Terry.
So listen, I--

03:36.582 --> 03:38.784
I want to let you know
that I am so, so sorry

03:38.851 --> 03:41.587
for any hurt that I have caused.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.522
We all know
you're a brilliant surgeon

03:43.524 --> 03:46.659
with an impeccable reputation,
and what I did was wrong.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.660
And I'm not that type of person.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.464
In due time,
I hope that you both

03:51.530 --> 03:52.998
will be able to see that.

03:53.065 --> 03:56.367
- The thing for me is,
I just didn't understand why.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.605
Because it was so long ago,
it was so not a thing--

03:59.672 --> 04:00.872
- Right, right.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.876
But you know,
I appreciate your apology.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.579
- So, okay--there's
still, like, a June bug...

04:08.380 --> 04:10.682
- She's like a dog with--
Squirrel!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.818
- Okay. Oh, it's gone.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.353
I got it.
- I appreciate your apology.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.888
Let's just move on and...
- Okay.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.623
- Forget about it.
- Okay.

04:18.691 --> 04:20.326
Okay, that's--
- Does that sound good?

04:20.392 --> 04:21.826
- That sounds good.
- Huh?

04:21.894 --> 04:23.295
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

04:23.297 --> 04:24.629
- I love that we all
have white on.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.631
- I don't know
how this happened.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.399
- I know, right?
- Let's do it!

04:28.468 --> 04:29.701
- Yeah.
- You ready for the--

04:29.703 --> 04:31.237
Ooh.
Arms all the way up.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.303
[laughs]

04:32.305 --> 04:33.639
- Let's get a little freshie
going, shall we?

04:33.706 --> 04:35.574
- Okay, all right.
- Let's all have a--

04:35.576 --> 04:36.576
[breathes deeply]
- Yes.

04:36.642 --> 04:38.510
- Honey, look, it's a fish.
- Oh!

04:38.577 --> 04:40.045
- There's like a full
fish thing happening.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.980
- Oh, I like a fish.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.649
- Shane just goes for all meat.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.850
No rice.
- He's a protein guy.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.285
- Look it, no rice.
- Sometimes Shane,

04:46.353 --> 04:47.452
like, we'll go to lunch...

04:47.520 --> 04:49.854
- Oh, my gosh, I'm starving.

04:49.922 --> 04:53.592
[indistinct chatter]

04:53.594 --> 04:55.060
- I feel like
you just cut me in line.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.427
I'm just saying.
- I'm the man of the hour.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.729
- I feel like
you just cut me in line,

04:57.731 --> 04:59.331
that's all I'm saying.
- Did you know that?

04:59.398 --> 05:00.499
- I just feel--
- That's what

05:00.566 --> 05:02.133
everyone's telling me, anyway.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.470
- Were Heather and Terry
gracious?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.073
- Terry was.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.075
Heather threatened me.

05:10.142 --> 05:11.876
"Not only will you
lose me as a friend,

05:11.944 --> 05:13.612
"you'll lose a lot more.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.482
And that's not a threat,
it's a promise."

05:16.549 --> 05:18.550
- Hmm.
- [sniffles]

05:18.617 --> 05:19.884
- That doesn't sit well with me.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.554
- I know. I know.

05:22.621 --> 05:24.222
- That's not okay.
- [sniffles]

05:24.290 --> 05:25.558
- It's okay.

05:25.624 --> 05:26.892
- My heart kind of breaks
for Shannon,

05:26.959 --> 05:28.760
'cause it's so undeserved.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.329
<i>When she hurts, I hurt,</i>

05:30.397 --> 05:34.333
and my defensiveness
for her comes out.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.167
<i>- Never really had
that kind of support.</i>

05:36.169 --> 05:37.570
<i>It means the world to me</i>

05:37.636 --> 05:39.437
to have someone in my life

05:39.505 --> 05:43.441
that I know has my back
no matter what.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.510
I didn't even bring
my makeup either.

05:45.578 --> 05:46.745
- Pretend we're twins.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.584
- Honestly, if you need us--

05:51.650 --> 05:53.518
I know we don't know
each other that well,

05:53.520 --> 05:54.886
but we're here.
- Thank you. Thank you.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.324
- No, no, no.
Just let her do her thing.

05:59.792 --> 06:00.725
My main issue with Noella,

06:00.793 --> 06:04.863
is that she's acting
very rude and snotty to me

06:04.865 --> 06:06.731
for no apparent reason.

06:06.799 --> 06:07.933
- Jennifer, please--
- Suing somebody

06:07.935 --> 06:09.201
and coming to their house,

06:09.268 --> 06:10.735
you need to talk to them
at that time.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.004
- I don't know if that chapter's

06:12.071 --> 06:13.672
in "Emily Post."

06:13.674 --> 06:15.006
- There's something there,

06:15.074 --> 06:17.209
and you're trying
to just figure it out, yeah.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.345
- And she's just like
not speaking to me.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.379
- So weird.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.448
<i>- I don't know what's going on
with Noella.</i>

06:22.514 --> 06:23.815
And all I want to do
is clear the air.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.618
- Well, here's
to brighter days, yes?

06:25.684 --> 06:27.018
- Mm, yes.
- Okay.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.421
- Just let her do her thing.
- Noella?

06:29.488 --> 06:30.855
What do you have in that cup?

06:30.923 --> 06:32.391
- Okay, it's a big cup
kind of night.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.825
- It looks like you like it.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.628
- Would you like to talk?
- I do--I just want to--

06:36.695 --> 06:39.564
I feel like there's
a tension between us,

06:39.566 --> 06:40.833
and I don't want it--
I know you're going through

06:40.900 --> 06:43.701
a lot of stuff--
- Okay.

06:43.769 --> 06:44.903
- I feel like there's something,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.104
and I don't want
to have something.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.373
- Okay.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.973
- So if there's
anything that I've done

06:49.041 --> 06:52.110
to upset you in any way,

06:52.178 --> 06:54.646
I could make it right,
I would like to.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.915
- Like, how many times
have we met each other?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.718
- Like, five or six probably?

06:58.784 --> 06:59.851
- I've met you twice.

06:59.853 --> 07:00.652
- Navo Bay Club.
I saw you a couple of times--

07:00.719 --> 07:01.853
- And then we met
at Braunwyn's house.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.590
- Braunwyn's house.
- One time at Braunwyn's house.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.494
<i>So Jen and I had met a year ago</i>

07:08.560 --> 07:11.529
through our mutual friend
Braunwyn Windham-Burke.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.265
<i>The two times that I met her,</i>

07:13.333 --> 07:15.133
it was very superficial.

07:15.201 --> 07:18.871
And then strangely
a little too familiar.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.273
<i>She was very quick
to do a selfie,</i>

07:21.340 --> 07:23.208
which definitely gave me
a weird vibe

07:23.210 --> 07:25.677
of, like, who is this girl?

07:25.745 --> 07:26.746
I just--
- Is there something I've done

07:26.812 --> 07:28.880
to you that has upset you?
- Yes.

07:28.948 --> 07:29.814
- Because--
- It's not upsetting,

07:29.882 --> 07:32.483
it was disturbing.
It was just weird to me.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.352
- What is that?
- Two weeks ago,

07:34.420 --> 07:37.756
you posted a picture
of yourself,

07:37.758 --> 07:42.827
poorly lit,
thanking your patients?

07:42.829 --> 07:45.096
And you tagged me in it.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.632
I work exclusively
with a certain med-spa,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.568
have for years.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.503
I actually had
to report it to Instagram

07:51.570 --> 07:52.904
to have it removed.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.808
- I don't even remember
tagging you.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.911
I'm sorry if that upset you.

07:58.978 --> 08:03.114
- Who tags somebody that
they've met twice in a photo

08:03.116 --> 08:05.851
of themselves?
That's not even a cute one?

08:05.918 --> 08:08.052
- I feel like I'm dealing
with a child

08:08.120 --> 08:09.921
who's throwing a temper tantrum,

08:09.989 --> 08:11.757
<i>and that's
an uncomfortable space for me.</i>

08:11.824 --> 08:13.925
This is when I would call
Ryan to step in.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.727
Ryan?
[chuckles]

08:15.795 --> 08:17.596
The children
are having a tantrum.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.732
- I could feel
a certain energy from you

08:19.798 --> 08:21.734
that you're a little thirsty.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.067
- I am not thirsty at all.
- I was just thinking, like,

08:23.135 --> 08:25.471
let's get this girl
a glass of lemonade,

08:25.538 --> 08:26.871
because she is, like...
- Literally--

Like, of course they're married,

40:24.454 --> 40:25.788
you can't file for divorce

40:25.856 --> 40:27.924
unless you're actually
legally married.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.860
<i>I think Noella
is being perpetuated</i>

40:30.928 --> 40:32.730
<i>as someone who</i>

40:32.796 --> 40:35.598
is not what
she really says she is.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.068
<i>And I'm starting to see
that her relationship,</i>

40:38.135 --> 40:40.504
and him serving her,
and divorcing,

40:40.570 --> 40:42.339
is true and accurate.

40:42.406 --> 40:45.074
<i>Which makes me question Jen.</i>

40:45.076 --> 40:46.477
- There's no heart there.

40:46.543 --> 40:47.610
I feel like

40:47.612 --> 40:49.612
she's a very inauthentic person.

40:49.614 --> 40:50.614
And I don't--
- I think--

40:50.681 --> 40:51.949
I think maybe
she's very clinical

40:52.015 --> 40:53.082
or something.
- I think--

40:53.084 --> 40:55.018
- Maybe she's--
- I think she's just thirsty.

40:55.085 --> 40:57.821
- [chuckles]
- Get that girl a drink.

40:57.888 --> 40:59.555
<i>James and I were
legally married,</i>

40:59.623 --> 41:01.157
summer of 2020.

41:01.225 --> 41:02.491
We had, like, a cute little

41:02.493 --> 41:04.528
backyard COVID wedding
with our son.

41:04.594 --> 41:05.696
<i>That's how divorce works.</i>

41:05.762 --> 41:07.497
You have to get legally
married first.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.167
Shocking, I know.

41:11.235 --> 41:12.702
- You can call me
or text me anytime.

41:12.769 --> 41:15.571
I--I mean that 100%.
- I know, I feel that.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.574
- And even if
you drink too much,

41:17.641 --> 41:18.475
or I drink too much,

41:18.543 --> 41:19.442
and you say something
sh---ty about me

41:19.510 --> 41:22.178
or I say some comment
about something--

41:22.246 --> 41:23.580
- Who cares?
- Who gives a (BLEEP)?

41:23.647 --> 41:25.648
We can work through it.
I want you to know

41:25.650 --> 41:28.919
that I'm genuinely,
genuinely here for you,

41:28.986 --> 41:31.654
and I will help you
any way I can.

41:31.722 --> 41:33.189
And I mean that 100%.
- Thank you.

41:33.257 --> 41:36.058
<i>I am leaning on these women.</i>

41:36.126 --> 41:38.128
Shannon, Emily, and Gina

41:38.195 --> 41:43.466
are just being
such incredible friends to me.

41:43.534 --> 41:45.134
- Let's go throw
those flowers out.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.503
- [laughs]

41:46.571 --> 41:49.805
- Seriously.
- Let's go smash some sh--.

41:49.873 --> 41:50.873
Come on, baby.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.008
You know the sad thing?

41:52.076 --> 41:54.210
I actually offered James
the dog.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.746
I didn't want him
to be alone right now.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.515
- Are you crazy?
Don't get rid of your dog.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.583
I would take my dog over Shane.

42:00.585 --> 42:02.551
[both laugh]

42:02.553 --> 42:05.221
Oh, is this your divorce--
Serving you divorce flowers?

42:05.289 --> 42:06.690
- Yep.
- Oh, my God.

42:06.757 --> 42:08.791
Let's get rid of these.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.160
We don't want
to keep these around.

42:10.227 --> 42:11.594
These are going in the trash.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.097
- Aww.

42:17.133 --> 42:19.101
- Throw the vase away too.
We don't need that.

42:19.169 --> 42:20.137
- I feel like I--
I feel like we could do

42:20.203 --> 42:21.504
so much damage to this.
Are we ready?

42:21.571 --> 42:22.605
- Yeah, do it.
Throw it.

42:22.673 --> 42:23.640
Throw it. Hard.

42:25.809 --> 42:26.809
- Bye, James.

42:26.811 --> 42:27.677
- Bye, James.
- Bye, James, bye.

42:27.745 --> 42:31.647
- Aw, Riri's scared.
- Oh, sweetheart.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.249
<i>- Next time,
on "The Real Housewives</i>

42:33.317 --> 42:34.684
<i>of Orange County."</i>

42:34.686 --> 42:37.587
- I found out
where the little ----er is.

42:37.654 --> 42:39.255
- That's good.
- Take a wild guess.

42:39.323 --> 42:41.624
Pick a continent.
- South Africa?

42:43.327 --> 42:46.196
- Oh, my God, I feel like
I'm gonna pass out.

42:46.263 --> 42:48.130
- Bet--
- Are you eating a sandwich?

42:48.198 --> 42:51.134
- Yeah, is that wrong?
- [laughs]

42:51.201 --> 42:53.202
- Oh, I love it.
- This is so pretty.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.204
- They have the chakra readers
over there.

42:55.206 --> 42:56.939
- Is there something
going on in my vagina?

42:57.007 --> 42:58.508
It's red.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.545
- Do you see yourself
being married someday?

43:02.612 --> 43:04.748
- I see myself marrying Reese.

43:04.815 --> 43:07.150
He's everything
I never got to experience

43:07.217 --> 43:09.085
as a kid.
- And that breaks my heart.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.152
- I don't know

43:10.220 --> 43:11.555
where all the animosity's
coming from.

43:11.622 --> 43:13.890
- The start of our friendship
was in your house,

43:13.892 --> 43:15.224
with you slamming people
against walls

43:15.226 --> 43:16.793
and yelling at people,
and that makes--

43:16.860 --> 43:18.094
- Slamming people against walls?

43:18.162 --> 43:19.095
- I heard it.

43:19.162 --> 43:20.764
I was right near the staircase.
