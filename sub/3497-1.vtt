01:21.182 --> 01:24.349
I could have sworn
I nailed him.

01:24.351 --> 01:30.255
Did you see the rack
on that sucker?

01:30.257 --> 01:34.293
You scared him,
but I hit him.

01:34.295 --> 01:37.863
I know. I know.

01:37.865 --> 01:38.897
You got him.

01:41.135 --> 01:44.303
What?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.237
I nailed the buck?

01:45.239 --> 01:47.706
Dude, I knew it!

02:18.205 --> 02:18.705
What?

02:27.580 --> 02:29.915
You see him?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.383
I don't see anything.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.186
I don't see shit.
I just see the stump.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.189
Past the stump.

02:38.358 --> 02:43.195
It's your birthday.
I'm gmng him to you.

02:47.433 --> 02:48.700
You still see him?

02:48.702 --> 02:51.770
Had him a second ago.

02:55.742 --> 02:56.642
You can have him.

02:56.644 --> 03:00.379
Being out here
with my big brother,

03:00.381 --> 03:05.617
it's a pretty cool birthday.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.290
Did you get him?

03:21.601 --> 03:25.337
Oh, shit.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.393
It's dick Cavanaugh.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.029
You shot dick Cavanaugh.
Holy shit.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.800
Just give me a second.
Let me think.

03:54.968 --> 03:59.438
Is he dead?
Nate, what do we do?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.406
Just give me a second
and let me think, okay?

04:01.408 --> 04:04.876
Hey, dick,
you get that four-pointer,

04:04.878 --> 04:07.546
you old son of a bitch?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.881
This looks so bad, man.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.483
I know.

04:12.920 --> 04:17.689
Man, it's another beautiful
day here in guerneville.

04:17.690 --> 04:21.560
77 degrees, from the back
of the post office here.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.929
Looks like shorts
and t-shirt weather

04:23.931 --> 04:27.766
is finally back
in the redwoods.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.468
A reminder from pat Cavanaugh,

04:29.470 --> 04:32.671
the annual Cavanaugh picnic
is coming up on the 23rd.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.475
You can get your raffle tickets
at Cavanaugh's bait and tackle.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.543
You don't want to miss out
on a chance

04:38.545 --> 04:40.545
to light the Cavanaugh Cannon.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.047
That sucker's loud.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.950
Hey, Jamie.
Yip, yip, yip, yip.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.719
- God damn.
- She's cute.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.088
She's goddamn cute.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.566
97.4 ktre, guerneville,

05:01.568 --> 05:07.939
Rio nido, monte Rio,
where the river meets the trees.

05:07.941 --> 05:13.612
Can't you shut the blinds?

05:13.614 --> 05:16.948
Nope.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.850
Okay...

05:21.954 --> 05:24.389
Now, tell me again
what happened

05:24.391 --> 05:25.624
after you shot the buck.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.759
I was running, and...

05:27.761 --> 05:29.828
- We were both...
- Skylar.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.498
Let Nate tell it this time.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.968
We were both running
after the deer.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.038
He saw something and motioned
for me to stop.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.076
And he got down on the ground,
and so did I.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.777
Took aim and...

05:45.779 --> 05:49.614
I didn't see what he saw, so...

05:49.616 --> 05:53.385
He asked me what I saw.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.556
Then he pulled the trigger.

05:57.558 --> 06:03.161
Skylar... you fired the shot

06:03.163 --> 06:05.897
that killed dick Cavanaugh?

06:11.137 --> 06:12.938
Yeah.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.808
Yeah, I did.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.684
Okay.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.520
- It was an accident.
- I know.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.122
You're acting like
you don't believe us.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.656
Doesn't matter
what I believe.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.958
He shot the mayor, he's dead.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.961
But he's only 17.
They can't charge him.

06:35.963 --> 06:42.000
Look, we have to do everything
by the book here.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.609
Come on, kiddo.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.148
This is bullshit!

06:56.150 --> 06:58.884
Nate, this isn't
a family matter.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.720
This is police business.
Just go home.

07:01.722 --> 07:07.092
Go home. Go home!

07:36.656 --> 07:39.057
You all right?

07:41.027 --> 07:43.795
Yeah.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.074
Hey, guys.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.977
Hey, Jamie.
Is your mother home?

07:58.979 --> 08:02.080
Uh, yeah.
She's on the computer.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.748
My dad's not here.

08:03.750 --> 08:08.286
Yeah, I know.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.668
You okay?

09:23.829 --> 09:26.031
It's Nate towne's truck.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.167
Son of a bitch.

09:30.636 --> 09:34.606
This... is for Uncle dick.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.579
Oh, shit!

09:43.950 --> 09:44.783
- Nate.
- What?

09:44.785 --> 09:48.186
- That's my cousin.
- Yeah. He hit my truck.

09:48.188 --> 09:52.757
He'll see us.

09:55.394 --> 09:58.129
Nate!

09:59.265 --> 10:00.865
Hey, it's the morning breeze

10:00.867 --> 10:03.168
with your favorite
tree-hugging dj,

10:03.170 --> 10:03.902
Mr. cool breeze.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.605
That last one goes out
to all you cavanaughs

10:06.607 --> 10:07.639
in your hard time.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.708
My thoughts and prayers
are with you.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.976
This one's for Eric Cavanaugh,

10:10.978 --> 10:14.713
going out to his lady love,
marina, with a reminder...

10:14.715 --> 10:20.285
Marina, baby, pick up some milk
on the way home.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.655
Lloyd.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.890
Jack.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.204
Jack...

10:39.206 --> 10:43.708
I am truly sorry
about your brother.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.111
Brass tacks, bloom.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.046
Melanie believes
there's motive.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.049
Well,
with all due respect, Jack,

10:51.051 --> 10:52.217
Melanie is in mourning.

10:52.219 --> 10:56.254
Whole town's in mourning
for its mayor.

10:57.723 --> 10:58.189
Yeah.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.257
By the way...

10:59.259 --> 11:02.260
I've noted that
skylar and Nate's deposition

11:02.262 --> 11:05.196
was taken by their father.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.266
Melanie is eager to see

11:08.268 --> 11:12.037
that skylar is treated
as an adult.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.174
He is 17 years old.

11:16.176 --> 11:21.413
Everyone in this room knows
there's history here.

11:23.449 --> 11:29.721
My boys know nothing
about that.

11:34.761 --> 11:39.998
Dad? What's going on?

11:40.000 --> 11:44.202
I brought you
some fresh clothes.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.971
Are they... are they
charging me with something?

11:46.973 --> 11:50.742
We've gotta let Jack
and Melanie do their thing.

11:50.744 --> 11:54.746
Okay? We've gotta let things
cool down a little bit.

11:54.748 --> 11:58.383
If you're innocent...
And I know that you are...

11:58.385 --> 12:02.954
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.463
Hey, bloom. Food's almost up.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.433
You want a cup of coffee
while you wait?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.868
Sounds good.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.073
You know, when there's
only one game in town,

12:55.075 --> 12:57.475
sometimes it's best
just not to play.

12:57.477 --> 13:02.046
It's taken me ten years
married to duffie Cavanaugh

13:02.048 --> 13:04.816
to figure that one out.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.820
I'll check on your food.

13:08.822 --> 13:13.324
Would you like anything else?

13:15.528 --> 13:19.998
Nate. Nate?

13:29.108 --> 13:32.877
Where's skylar?

13:32.879 --> 13:34.445
He's at the station.

13:34.447 --> 13:39.017
They're gonna take him
to county at 4:00.

13:39.019 --> 13:39.617
Why?

13:39.619 --> 13:43.321
Because they want to try him
as an adult.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.357
Try him for what?

13:46.359 --> 13:51.162
They're gonna try him
for murder.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.998
Can't you do something?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.301
The last thing
skylar needs is for me

13:56.303 --> 13:57.302
to be gumming everything up

13:57.304 --> 13:59.103
by pulling strings
trying to get him out.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.371
You think if the tables
were turned,

14:00.373 --> 14:02.240
and it was a Cavanaugh
sitting in that cell...

14:02.242 --> 14:03.408
- We're not cavanaughs!

14:03.410 --> 14:04.442
How does that big thumb feel

14:04.444 --> 14:09.013
pressing down on your head?

14:09.015 --> 14:13.117
Eat your hamburger.

14:24.129 --> 14:27.165
That too tight?

14:27.167 --> 14:30.969
No. I'm okay.

15:43.342 --> 15:44.676
You want to grab a beer?

15:44.678 --> 15:46.678
I thought you were on duty.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.582
Yeah.
I just figured I'd watch.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.551
Well, I'm gonna
get home early,

15:53.553 --> 15:56.621
so I can get out to Santa rosa
for the arraignment.

15:56.623 --> 16:01.192
Here, sign this.

16:02.261 --> 16:08.433
- It's your report.
- Yeah.

16:13.405 --> 16:16.307
I was over
at Randy's house last night.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.077
I'm five minutes late,
brought the wrong kind of beer.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.144
He chewed me out
for 20 minutes.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.681
Hey, this guy's pretty close.
He's on my ass.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.317
- Shit, he rammed us!
- Watch out! Watch out!

16:26.319 --> 16:27.485
He's coming around the side.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.454
Watch the road, man! Stay left!

16:29.456 --> 16:30.555
Watch that tree!
Hit the brakes!

16:30.557 --> 16:34.125
Oh, shit, we're going over!

16:34.127 --> 16:36.327
Oh, my God!

16:36.329 --> 16:40.465
Don't move. Nobody move.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.741
Oh. Hey, Lloyd.

16:49.743 --> 16:52.343
- Tom, Guthrie.
- Officer.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.046
Why don't you boys
drink your beer in the bar

16:55.048 --> 16:56.714
like everybody else?

16:56.716 --> 16:57.648
You know it's a ticket.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.352
Well, it is a beautiful,
sunshiny day.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.720
It is lovely outside
today, isn't it?

17:02.722 --> 17:07.525
Plus, bloom usually
just gives us a warning, so...

17:07.527 --> 17:10.361
You've already been warned.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.663
Oh, come on.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.199
What?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.300
Hey, Lloyd, we got a report

17:16.301 --> 17:18.269
of an accident
up by the rock quarry.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.671
Can you go check it out?

17:20.673 --> 17:21.606
All right, I'm on it.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.241
Come on, Lloyd,
don't give us a ticket.

17:23.242 --> 17:27.045
We're family, man.
The law's the law, tom.

17:27.047 --> 17:32.183
Family doesn't change that.
Have a nice day.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.651
Give me the fucking keys!

17:33.653 --> 17:37.388
You're digging yourself
the deepest hole, kid.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.424
You want to talk
about deep holes?

17:39.426 --> 17:42.527
Look down.

17:42.529 --> 17:46.297
- Come on!
- Okay, okay, here.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.269
- Don't rock it.
- Come on, get out.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.104
- Watch it.
- Come on, get out!

17:53.106 --> 17:54.572
- Nate?
- Shh.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.840
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.809
What the hell
are you doing, man?

17:57.811 --> 17:59.844
Trust me,
you're already screwed.

17:59.846 --> 18:03.381
- Just don't rock the van.
- Hey, shut up!

18:07.119 --> 18:09.420
- Hold on.
- Wait!

18:09.422 --> 18:12.190
Shit. No!

18:35.547 --> 18:40.818
Run. Run. Come on!

18:44.656 --> 18:47.592
Nate, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

18:47.594 --> 18:49.227
A bunch of bullshit
is going down.

18:49.229 --> 18:54.198
I had to do something.
Give me your hands.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.370
Now what the fuck
are we gonna do?

18:59.372 --> 19:02.140
We'll go to Uncle Mike's.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.178
Easy. Easy.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.314
The last thing I want to do
is hurt you boys.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.150
You know that.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.652
Skylar, I want you
to hand me that pistol...

19:14.654 --> 19:17.288
By the barrel, real slow.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.524
Take your mask off, Nate.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.261
Take your mask off, Nate.

19:26.398 --> 19:29.367
All right, what happened
to those two deputies?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.702
They're gone.
They kept going.

19:31.704 --> 19:36.574
Probably in Santa rosa
by now, dumb fucks.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.611
All right, I want you
to put these on,

19:40.613 --> 19:46.350
one on each of you.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.594
Get out of the car.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.828
What were you thinking?

19:57.830 --> 20:02.633
Huh? You trying to convince
everybody you're guilty?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.268
They're already convinced.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.270
Not me. I've been trying
to give you boys

20:06.272 --> 20:07.205
the benefit of the doubt.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.674
But you're making it
really difficult.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.476
Innocent people don't bust out
of a police van

20:12.478 --> 20:18.216
before they've even been tried.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.284
Nate!

20:48.280 --> 20:49.380
Come on, we gotta jump.

20:49.382 --> 20:53.951
Come on, sky, you can do it.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.301
- Hello?
- Bloom...

21:10.303 --> 21:12.903
We got a big problem.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.001
Hey, Lloyd,

21:44.003 --> 21:45.703
where the hell are you?

21:45.705 --> 21:48.773
The phones are going nuts
down here.

21:57.449 --> 21:59.784
Looks like he's home.

21:59.786 --> 22:04.722
I don't know if this
is such a good idea.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.691
What if he calls dad?

22:06.693 --> 22:12.096
Mike doesn't have a phone.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.704
Aah!

22:19.706 --> 22:21.572
Looking for a 20

22:21.574 --> 22:24.775
on Lloyd or bloom.

22:35.687 --> 22:39.724
Oh, shit.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.904
Come on, help me.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.584
Ow!

23:06.586 --> 23:09.153
- Unh!
- Ow! Ow.

23:13.860 --> 23:18.596
It's open.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.868
I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.169
What's the occasion?

23:25.171 --> 23:27.938
It's not my birthday again,
is it?

23:27.940 --> 23:28.806
Nope.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.175
I'm looking for Nate
and skylar.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.810
You seen 'em?

23:32.812 --> 23:34.178
I haven't seen 'em,
but if I do,

23:34.180 --> 23:39.417
I'll let 'em know
that you're looking for 'em.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.751
If they're here, Mike,

23:40.753 --> 23:44.889
it's important
that you tell me.

23:44.891 --> 23:48.459
Dick Cavanaugh's dead.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.831
Are they here?

23:53.833 --> 23:55.900
How many you got out there?

23:55.902 --> 23:57.001
Just Lloyd.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.737
The man who knew too much.
What a fuck.

23:59.739 --> 24:03.441
Well, that's all water
under the bridge now.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.744
Maybe under your bridge,
bloom.

24:06.746 --> 24:12.450
Sarah is still dead.

24:38.243 --> 24:41.946
Come on up out of there.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.996
You guys all right?

24:58.998 --> 25:02.199
Yeah, we're fine.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.271
Lloyd Cavanaugh.

25:07.273 --> 25:12.610
Well... this is
certainly an honor.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.544
Michael Spencer.

25:13.546 --> 25:16.547
I see you're still
digging foxholes

25:16.549 --> 25:17.982
out in your front yard.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.683
Waiting for world war III?

25:19.685 --> 25:21.185
Lloyd, I asked you
to stay in the car.

25:21.187 --> 25:25.656
Yeah, I just wanted
to make sure everything's okay.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.092
- I got this.
- Good.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.562
Let's take these boys down
to the station, then, huh?

25:31.564 --> 25:35.199
You're not taking anybody
anywhere.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.269
Lloyd, just go wait
in the car.

25:38.271 --> 25:40.738
I've got this under control.

25:40.740 --> 25:45.743
YOU DON'T HAVE <i>ANYTHING</i>
UNDER CONTROL.

25:45.745 --> 25:49.914
Look, Mike... I get it.

25:49.916 --> 25:53.284
You're still pissed,
and you have every right to be.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.052
Dad, what's he talking about?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.254
Never mind, just, uh...
Go get in the car.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.723
We'll talk about it
on the way back to town.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.093
Boys, it's up to you.

26:03.095 --> 26:08.032
Sometimes fighting
can put you in jail...

26:08.034 --> 26:10.334
Sometimes it can keep you out.

26:10.336 --> 26:13.237
We're not going to jail.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.672
Look, I'm taking the boys
outside,

26:14.674 --> 26:16.140
and I'll wait for you, okay?

26:16.142 --> 26:19.677
Back off, Cavanaugh.

26:19.679 --> 26:23.314
Lloyd, get outside!

26:23.316 --> 26:25.916
Nate, skylar, run!

26:25.918 --> 26:28.652
Mike!

26:46.838 --> 26:50.975
Nate! Nate!

26:50.977 --> 26:53.811
Skylar!

27:08.159 --> 27:10.661
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

27:10.663 --> 27:13.430
Put your seat belt back on.

27:16.334 --> 27:18.335
I don't want to sound outside
the bounds of the law.

27:18.337 --> 27:22.673
It's not as if I'm suggesting
a... a posse or something.

27:22.675 --> 27:26.076
Getting a conviction
is not gonna be a problem.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.078
I can hang a homicide
on both boys

27:28.080 --> 27:28.946
for the deputies alone.

27:28.948 --> 27:32.216
I'm not talking
about the courts anymore.

27:32.218 --> 27:38.188
I think we both know why towne
might want to hurt dick.

27:38.190 --> 27:42.926
I think justice needs
to be served for dick.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.195
It's the situation with bloom...

27:45.197 --> 27:48.165
- Bloom towne's not a problem.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.734
Randy.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.470
I'm so glad you're here.

27:53.472 --> 27:57.941
Sit down. Good to see you.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.743
Let me sit down there.

27:59.745 --> 28:04.715
Now, bloom may be a fool,
but he knows his place.

28:04.717 --> 28:09.153
And, Jack, we're gonna need
a little interference

28:09.155 --> 28:11.955
down at the county courthouse.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.291
It's not a problem.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.492
Talked to Donald
a few minutes ago.

28:15.494 --> 28:18.462
Said he's gonna try
to buy us a couple days.

28:18.464 --> 28:22.199
This is a family issue now.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.169
That's how we'll treat it.

28:27.205 --> 28:31.742
It's not working.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.811
What are you doing?

28:33.813 --> 28:36.914
Gotta take a piss.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.990
- Dude.
- Sorry.

28:55.801 --> 28:58.001
What the hell
was Mike talking about?

28:58.003 --> 29:00.938
What do you mean?

29:00.940 --> 29:05.943
He was going on and on,
like Lloyd did something.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.145
Hell if I know.

29:08.147 --> 29:12.349
You know what Mike was like.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.529
We gotta go back.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.165
We gotta talk to dad.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.067
Fuck that.

29:30.069 --> 29:33.403
We gotta turn ourselves in.

29:33.405 --> 29:36.440
What are we doing?
Where are we going?

29:36.442 --> 29:39.276
What are... what are you gonna do
with that?

29:39.278 --> 29:41.545
Remember mom's friend
jacylin?

29:41.547 --> 29:43.514
The one in Canada?

29:43.516 --> 29:45.949
She always said
she'd do anything for mom.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.118
Canada's, like,
a thousand Miles from here.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.555
Yeah, that's the point.
The farther the better.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.390
Skylar, they were gonna
try you as an adult.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.226
If I hadn't busted you out,
you'd be fucked now.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.429
Totally fucked.
Just like Uncle Mike!

30:00.565 --> 30:03.901
So what do we do?

30:03.903 --> 30:08.071
We get to cloverdale,
hop a freight train to humboldt.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.908
A freight train?

30:10.910 --> 30:13.143
Okay... we steal a car.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.913
Or, no.
What was that lady's name?

30:15.915 --> 30:17.514
The one that dad did
a couple times,

30:17.516 --> 30:19.817
with the big tits?

30:19.819 --> 30:20.217
Susan?

30:20.219 --> 30:23.187
Yeah. Remember, she took us
fishing on her boat?

30:23.189 --> 30:24.288
400-mile range?

30:24.290 --> 30:26.323
Boat, head up the coast
to Vancouver.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.092
Stop for gas a couple times,
and boom, we're home free!

30:29.094 --> 30:32.129
- Keys are in the flower pot.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you, Susan.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.465
You'll find your boat
in Vancouver harbor.

30:37.235 --> 30:41.405
- Hey, Jenny, anything yet?
- Nothing yet.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.274
Thanks.

30:48.012 --> 30:51.281
You get that filled out yet?

30:51.283 --> 30:55.886
I'll take care of it.

30:55.888 --> 31:00.524
You don't need to stay, Randy.

31:00.526 --> 31:06.630
Listen to me, bloom. Okay?

31:06.632 --> 31:09.166
Okay.

31:09.168 --> 31:12.402
I imagine you're wondering
what you can do

31:12.404 --> 31:14.271
to help your boys.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.374
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

31:17.376 --> 31:21.245
But you've got a dilemma.

31:21.247 --> 31:25.983
A conflict of interest.
Correct?

31:25.985 --> 31:29.253
You know, I don't know
if I'd call it that.

31:29.255 --> 31:33.690
You've got two cop killers
out there

31:33.692 --> 31:36.159
that just happen to be
your sons.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.263
The details are sketchy.

31:39.265 --> 31:42.165
You've got
a serious conflict here.

31:42.167 --> 31:43.166
You understand?

31:43.168 --> 31:45.302
You know, you could
look at is as though

31:45.304 --> 31:51.208
we both have
a serious conflict here.

31:51.210 --> 31:55.545
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:00.018 --> 32:04.988
You know, you've done
all right by us, bloom.

32:07.525 --> 32:12.462
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing here.

32:13.998 --> 32:18.702
Get me that report
by the end of the day.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.237
Whoa!

33:00.478 --> 33:02.412
What do we do?

33:03.582 --> 33:07.551
Now. Go!

33:18.062 --> 33:24.368
Shit. Is that Lloyd?

33:25.803 --> 33:29.639
Hey, Nate, did I get you?

33:31.275 --> 33:34.411
Joel? Is that you?

33:34.413 --> 33:36.713
Yeah. It's me and Tony.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.382
You gotta be kidding me.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.017
It's Joel Cavanaugh.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.351
What?

33:41.353 --> 33:43.687
What's your problem, dude?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.355
You guys killed my Uncle.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.624
My dad says it's open season
on you two.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.193
You know that your dad's
an asshole, right?

33:50.195 --> 33:52.562
Hey, what about yours?
I don't see him out here

33:52.564 --> 33:53.530
doing you any favors!

33:53.532 --> 33:55.465
- Come here.
- What?

33:55.467 --> 33:56.199
Take this.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.736
So you thought
just you and Tony

33:59.738 --> 34:02.372
could take us out alone?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.573
You're high.

34:03.575 --> 34:07.177
Who says we came alone?

34:07.179 --> 34:11.380
They're bluffing.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.716
You want to give up?

34:12.717 --> 34:16.420
Yeah, right. Suck it!

34:23.429 --> 34:25.829
Give me an arrow.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.637
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:36.373 --> 34:42.579
Bows and arrows?

34:42.581 --> 34:43.179
Aah!

34:43.181 --> 34:46.483
Get me back, you fucker!
Oh, God!

34:46.485 --> 34:47.217
Son of a bitch!

34:47.219 --> 34:48.652
I'm gonna kill you now!
Nice shot.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.353
Dude! Dude,
what are you doing?

34:50.355 --> 34:53.690
Where are you going?

34:53.692 --> 34:55.592
You stupid pussy!

34:55.594 --> 35:00.397
I have the keys.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.235
Hey, Nate?

35:05.237 --> 35:05.869
Yeah.

35:05.871 --> 35:11.241
I think I'm gonna die
if you leave me here.

35:15.813 --> 35:18.381
You fucking assholes!

35:18.383 --> 35:21.518
You shot first.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.520
Holy shit, Joel.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.556
Where'd you get an m16?

35:26.558 --> 35:28.258
My dad's.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.261
And a grenade?

35:31.263 --> 35:34.664
It's just tear gas.

35:34.666 --> 35:41.204
Tony really stood by you.
Friends till the end, huh?

35:41.206 --> 35:42.706
Carry me.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.541
Carry me back.
Are you kidding?

35:44.543 --> 35:46.910
How am I supposed to get back?
I can't fucking walk!

35:46.912 --> 35:48.278
You should have thought
of that

35:48.280 --> 35:49.446
before you came out here,
dipshit!

35:49.448 --> 35:51.648
Let's get these things off.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.519
One, two, three!

35:56.622 --> 35:57.487
Aw, fuck!

35:57.489 --> 35:58.955
You literally couldn't hit

35:58.957 --> 36:01.491
a fuckin' elephant
at point blank.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.227
Shut your face, Joel.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.429
Retard.

36:06.431 --> 36:09.533
You think I can't
hit you from here?

36:09.535 --> 36:10.567
Okay.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.736
I will blow your head
clean off!

36:12.738 --> 36:14.504
Okay. Come on, dude,
I was just fucking with you.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.439
One more dead Cavanaugh
doesn't mean shit to me!

36:16.441 --> 36:19.709
Come on, man, I was just
fucking kidding with you.

36:19.711 --> 36:20.610
Nate, come on.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.779
Nate, come on.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.447
Let's get the cuffs off.

36:31.522 --> 36:34.424
Tony, I'm over here. Come on.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.896
Nate, get the cuffs off.
Get 'em off.

36:39.898 --> 36:40.530
Okay.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.865
Here, let me do it this time.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.966
- I got it.
- Let me do it.

36:42.968 --> 36:46.937
I got it! Ready?

36:46.939 --> 36:47.704
Yeah.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.273
Turn your head away. Ready?

36:51.343 --> 36:54.644
Oh... aw, shit, it's empty.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.481
Nate! You shot Joel.

36:58.483 --> 37:02.519
He's bleeding really bad, man.
That's fucked up.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.488
Okay, take it easy, Tony.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.990
Put the gun down.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.292
Put the gun down, Tony.
You know I'll shoot.

37:09.294 --> 37:13.797
Okay, all right,
we're gonna do it together.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.833
Ready? On the count of three.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.803
One, two...

37:19.805 --> 37:23.406
Finger off the trigger.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.976
Three.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.915
Okay. Okay. Okay.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.317
You guys are
in so much trouble.

37:34.319 --> 37:37.520
Yeah. Yeah.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.489
- Unh!
- Uhh!

37:43.996 --> 37:45.662
Shit. Tony!

37:45.664 --> 37:50.333
Tony, you all right?
Unh. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.890
This is Ronnie.

38:46.892 --> 38:51.895
You got your ears on, Eric?

38:51.897 --> 38:53.396
I just pissed away
the last of my beer.

38:53.398 --> 38:59.069
You got anything to drink
in the shit bucket of yours?

38:59.071 --> 39:01.438
Well, I'm gonna run into town
and grab something.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.605
You want anything?

39:02.607 --> 39:03.840
That's bullshit, dude.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.475
Randy's gonna filet your balls.

39:05.477 --> 39:10.613
He said don't move
till he tells us otherwise.

39:10.615 --> 39:12.349
What are we even
doing out here, man?

39:12.351 --> 39:14.918
I mean, you really think
Nate and skylar meant

39:14.920 --> 39:18.154
to kill dick... on purpose?

39:18.156 --> 39:19.789
Come on.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.393
Two words... filet... balls.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.024
What the fuck, man?

39:55.026 --> 39:57.026
This is my Uncle's
fuckin' truck,

39:57.028 --> 39:58.161
you fuckin' shithead!

39:58.163 --> 39:59.764
I return this thing
with a scratch on it,

39:59.765 --> 40:03.566
he's gonna kick the shit
out of me.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.909
All right, bitch.

40:17.482 --> 40:21.551
Here ya go.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.790
Damn it!

40:38.502 --> 40:41.471
Damn, that dude's fast.

40:44.176 --> 40:45.708
Shit.

40:45.710 --> 40:49.579
That's Eric's truck.
That's Ronnie.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.614
What are they doing?

40:51.616 --> 40:52.816
All right, a sixer
of cold ones

40:52.818 --> 40:54.484
if you can take the bottle
off my head.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.686
Twelver for me if you can't.

40:56.688 --> 40:59.556
You're on, dipshit.

41:04.528 --> 41:06.696
Yeah!

41:06.698 --> 41:07.597
Nice!

41:07.599 --> 41:09.866
- Two out of three.
- No way, dude.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.100
- Yeah, way.
- Get out there.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.936
Ken, get that can on his head.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.737
- No way.
- Rules are rules.

41:14.739 --> 41:18.074
Two out of three.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.042
You're a dick, man.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.543
You aim low,
I'm seriously gonna

41:20.545 --> 41:22.212
kick the shit our of you...
You know that, right?

41:22.214 --> 41:23.246
Don't distract me, man.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.915
How you gonna kick anybody's ass
if you don't have a head?

41:25.917 --> 41:28.785
Hey, wait a second, wait,
wait, wait, Ronnie, turn around.

41:28.787 --> 41:29.953
You're not getting out
of this.

41:29.955 --> 41:33.056
- Keys! Keys! Keys!
- Nate and skylar.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.224
Hey!

41:34.226 --> 41:35.225
Dude, that's my truck.

41:35.227 --> 41:37.093
They're gonna steal it.

41:37.095 --> 41:41.197
They're not goin' anywhere.

41:41.199 --> 41:45.068
Aw, shit! Come on.

41:47.204 --> 41:50.874
Who the hell is that?

41:50.876 --> 41:54.644
Shit, dude.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.146
My bad!

41:57.148 --> 41:58.615
Did you see Larry go down?

41:58.617 --> 42:02.051
- You think he's okay?
- Who cares?

42:39.924 --> 42:44.594
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

43:00.744 --> 43:03.746
20 on the towne boys
is 5 to 1.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.316
Nah, 20 on Randy.

43:46.857 --> 43:50.026
You were jackin' off,
God damn it!

43:50.028 --> 43:50.994
You were jackin' off,

43:50.996 --> 43:53.830
and those fuckin' towne
shitheads got away!

43:53.832 --> 43:57.967
You, you dumb fuck, come here.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.902
Look what the fuck
they did to Larry!

43:59.904 --> 44:01.004
Look at him! Huh?

44:01.006 --> 44:02.305
WHAT THE <i>FUCK</i>
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

44:02.307 --> 44:05.274
What kind of shithead are you?

44:05.276 --> 44:07.143
All of you.

44:07.145 --> 44:10.713
They killed dick.
They killed two cops.

44:10.715 --> 44:12.749
Now they fucked Larry up.
And what are you doing?

44:12.751 --> 44:14.751
You're out here playing,
what, William tell?

44:14.753 --> 44:16.753
You heard me at the house.

44:16.755 --> 44:20.823
These boys do not need
to come back with us.

44:20.825 --> 44:21.858
I thought I was clear.

44:21.860 --> 44:28.431
We're not out here
to suck each other's cocks.

44:28.433 --> 44:32.468
Fuck. Ronnie?

44:32.470 --> 44:33.903
Don't worry, I got it.

44:33.905 --> 44:35.838
Okay, that's better.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.974
Now, you got
two teenage boys out there

44:37.976 --> 44:40.410
making you all look
like a bunch of idiots.

44:40.412 --> 44:41.778
If they reach the county line,

44:41.780 --> 44:43.946
<i>I'M</i> GONNA LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT!

44:43.948 --> 44:45.114
You understand?

44:45.116 --> 44:48.017
Well, stop looking at me.
Go get 'em, God damn it.

44:48.019 --> 44:52.755
Hurry the fuck up!
Move! Do some-fuckin'-thing!

44:52.757 --> 44:56.325
Jesus.

44:56.327 --> 45:00.229
Lloyd,
fuckin' get Larry some help.

45:00.231 --> 45:01.130
In the paper today,

45:01.132 --> 45:04.267
I see that Donald Cavanaugh's
gerrymandering case

45:04.269 --> 45:05.835
came to a close yesterday,

45:05.837 --> 45:08.504
which means we've got
a new congressman.

45:08.506 --> 45:11.274
Congrats, Donald.
Fishing season is here,

45:11.276 --> 45:14.110
so here's a reminder
from our chief of police,

45:14.112 --> 45:15.311
bloomfield towne...

45:15.313 --> 45:16.846
Fishing off our Bridges is...

45:16.848 --> 45:19.082
- Hey, Travis, you still
up on sterrit hill?

45:19.084 --> 45:21.284
- Yeah.
- You seen Ronnie?

45:21.286 --> 45:22.151
I lost track of him.

45:22.153 --> 45:24.053
They're headed west
along pocket canyon.

45:24.055 --> 45:26.022
They're right behind
the towne boys.

45:26.024 --> 45:28.091
- No shit.
- Yeah.

45:29.060 --> 45:32.195
Randy says don't bother
bringing 'em back alive.

45:32.197 --> 45:36.933
You wanna get a beer later?

47:00.151 --> 47:04.220
If you could eat anything,

47:04.222 --> 47:06.622
what would you have right now?

47:06.624 --> 47:10.359
Mmm...

47:10.361 --> 47:13.596
Mom's spaghetti.

48:10.154 --> 48:12.388
This is Travis.
We're up at elephant Ridge.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.290
The towne boys are down
below us in the canyon,

48:14.292 --> 48:15.658
but we can't get down there
from here.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.560
We gotta go around.
Anyone closer?

48:17.562 --> 48:22.565
Uh, yeah.
I'm with Ronnie, we're on it.

49:03.540 --> 49:08.110
How far do you think
we've got? Unh!

49:08.112 --> 49:11.280
Maybe 12 Miles.

49:11.282 --> 49:15.651
Boat had a bed underneath,
didn't it?

49:17.120 --> 49:21.991
Yeah, and a little kitchen.
Hold up.

49:29.366 --> 49:30.433
Dude, we gotta get going.

49:30.435 --> 49:35.438
They're probably
right behind us.

49:35.440 --> 49:36.639
It's all right.

49:36.641 --> 49:41.010
It took us, like, 15 minutes
to cross that canyon.

49:41.012 --> 49:45.514
What about the next Ridge?

49:48.352 --> 49:52.655
What are we gonna do now?

49:53.457 --> 49:55.791
We keep going.

49:55.793 --> 49:58.227
Ow! Fuck!

49:58.229 --> 49:59.462
Oh, sorry, man.

50:03.401 --> 50:07.470
Where the fuck is dad?

50:09.806 --> 50:11.374
Dad's a pussy.

50:11.376 --> 50:14.176
They could parade us around town
on a couple of spikes,

50:14.178 --> 50:18.314
he still wouldn't give a shit.

50:18.316 --> 50:23.652
How come he's such a pussy...
Since mom died?

50:23.654 --> 50:28.491
What the fuck happened to him?

50:29.693 --> 50:35.798
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

50:36.266 --> 50:40.436
You know what Uncle Mike
was talking about, don't you?

50:40.438 --> 50:41.670
They're coming, dude.

50:41.672 --> 50:45.708
I don't care. Tell me.

50:45.710 --> 50:46.575
Fuck it.

50:46.577 --> 50:50.613
It was dick that hit mom's car.

50:50.615 --> 50:54.083
- What?
- He hit it with his car.

50:54.085 --> 50:56.652
Drunk.
He passed out at the wheel.

50:56.654 --> 50:57.853
Dad and Lloyd found the wreck.

50:57.855 --> 50:59.255
There was no way
dick was gonna do time,

50:59.257 --> 51:01.424
so dad filed it
as a hit and run.

51:01.426 --> 51:04.126
Bullshit.

51:04.128 --> 51:09.098
Why do you think dad
made chief so easily?

51:09.100 --> 51:14.103
Dad covered up mom's killing,
so he could be chief?

51:16.139 --> 51:18.441
Basically.

51:18.443 --> 51:22.645
No. No fucking way.

51:27.684 --> 51:28.317
Fuck.

51:28.319 --> 51:30.653
Got it?
Come on, we gotta move.

51:30.655 --> 51:33.189
Why didn't you tell me?

51:33.191 --> 51:34.757
Uncle Mike made me promise
not to tell.

51:34.759 --> 51:38.561
Uncle Mike told you,
and you weren't gonna tell me?

51:38.563 --> 51:40.729
He was gonna do something.

51:40.731 --> 51:45.401
He was gonna get dick back,
and then...

51:45.403 --> 51:49.905
What? And then what, Nate?

51:49.907 --> 51:51.807
He was gonna do it anyway.

51:51.809 --> 51:55.845
Do what?
Just fucking tell me!

52:02.385 --> 52:06.689
You knew it was him.

52:06.691 --> 52:09.825
You knew it was dick
in the woods.

52:09.827 --> 52:12.862
Oh, my God, you saw him.

52:12.864 --> 52:15.464
You let me tell everyone
I did it.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.166
What the fuck, Nate?

52:17.168 --> 52:18.734
I didn't plan it, skylar!

52:18.736 --> 52:20.503
I saw him,
and I pulled the trigger.

52:20.505 --> 52:21.804
I didn't even really
think about it.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.172
You didn't think about it,

52:23.174 --> 52:26.375
and you let me take the blame!

52:26.377 --> 52:28.144
I told you not to.

52:28.146 --> 52:30.779
That's why you busted me out,
because you felt guilty?

52:30.781 --> 52:33.916
I busted you out
because neither of us deserves

52:33.918 --> 52:36.752
to go to jail
for dick Cavanaugh!

52:36.754 --> 52:39.421
I sure as hell don't!

52:39.423 --> 52:41.524
Fuck this! I'm starving.

52:41.526 --> 52:43.526
Oh, skylar, do you even know
where you're going?

52:43.528 --> 52:44.860
We have to stick to the plan,
remember?

52:44.862 --> 52:46.395
We have to head west
to the coast.

52:46.397 --> 52:47.897
You took me hunting
on my birthday

52:47.899 --> 52:49.698
to use me as an alibi
for murder.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.967
I swear to God, dude!

52:51.969 --> 52:53.269
I thought it was a buck!

52:53.271 --> 52:54.870
I got it in my sights,
saw it was dick,

52:54.872 --> 52:55.971
and I pulled the trigger.

52:55.973 --> 52:59.375
He killed mom,
and he got away with it!

52:59.377 --> 53:02.945
What don't you
fucking understand?

53:02.947 --> 53:06.649
Dude, nothing has changed.

53:06.651 --> 53:11.253
We can still make it
to the boat.

53:16.459 --> 53:20.229
- Oh, yeah.
- Here we go.

53:20.231 --> 53:24.233
That's bloom.

53:28.405 --> 53:29.772
Go talk to him.

53:29.774 --> 53:30.906
Don't tell me what to do.

53:30.908 --> 53:33.709
Yeah, you'll do it,
won't you?

53:33.711 --> 53:34.310
Exactly.

53:34.312 --> 53:35.945
I'll stick this bottle
up your ass, dude,

53:35.947 --> 53:39.949
and you'll like it.

53:41.851 --> 53:43.319
Hey, bloom, what's happening?

53:43.321 --> 53:45.588
- You're happening, Guthrie.
- Thanks.

53:45.590 --> 53:46.689
What's with the roadblock?

53:46.691 --> 53:50.759
Oh, we're not supposed
to let you go by.

53:50.761 --> 53:51.827
Yeah? Just me?

53:51.829 --> 53:54.363
Yeah, um, pretty much.
No offense.

53:54.365 --> 53:58.534
Randy told us, you know,
most likely you'd be coming by,

53:58.536 --> 54:00.536
and we're definitely
supposed to stop you.

54:00.538 --> 54:01.804
You got room to turn around?

54:01.806 --> 54:05.507
- Yeah, probably do.
- Okay, good.

54:05.509 --> 54:08.010
- That's tom's Camaro.
- Uh-huh.

54:08.012 --> 54:11.413
Yeah, that's his baby.
Randy specifically said

54:11.415 --> 54:13.315
that we're supposed to stop you
from going past.

54:13.317 --> 54:15.784
Hey, halt! Stop. Come on.

54:15.786 --> 54:18.787
Stop! Whoa! Shit! God damn it.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.522
Dude, what are you doing?

54:20.524 --> 54:21.924
I mean, I would have
shot your tires out

54:21.926 --> 54:23.759
if I could've got my stupid gun

54:23.761 --> 54:25.694
out of my pants.

54:25.696 --> 54:29.531
Well, I guess
I'll just go home.

54:29.533 --> 54:31.834
You guys have
all the roads blocked, huh?

54:31.836 --> 54:33.502
Yeah. You know,

54:33.504 --> 54:35.671
we're just kinda circling
skylar and Nate

54:35.673 --> 54:37.573
up on, uh, moscow road.

54:37.575 --> 54:40.276
Got 'em...

54:40.278 --> 54:42.411
- Okay.

54:42.413 --> 54:43.479
Well, you stay warm, Guthrie.

54:43.481 --> 54:46.649
And if you're gonna drive,
don't drink too much, okay?

54:46.651 --> 54:49.318
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.486
Thanks, bloom.

54:50.488 --> 54:51.787
Shit ain't funny, bloom!

54:51.789 --> 54:53.522
- Later, bloom.
- Back it on up.

54:53.524 --> 54:55.524
- What'd he say?
- Nothin' much. He's cool.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.059
- Nothin' much?
- Yeah, he's cool.

54:57.061 --> 54:59.728
Couldn't stop him...

54:59.730 --> 55:03.599
My gun got stuck. You guys
could've done something.

55:03.601 --> 55:07.403
Just chill out, man.
Everything's fine.

55:16.713 --> 55:19.381
It's a nice day out.
Maybe he's gonna...

55:19.383 --> 55:20.416
- Shut up.

55:20.418 --> 55:24.486
What are you doing, bloom?

55:27.824 --> 55:31.493
Huh?

55:31.495 --> 55:33.095
I think he...
Think he's gotta pee.

55:33.097 --> 55:35.964
Dude, he's definitely got...
He's peeing.

55:35.966 --> 55:38.534
He's messing with us
is what he's doing.

55:38.536 --> 55:44.139
Hey. Bloom?

55:44.141 --> 55:45.808
Bloom?

55:45.810 --> 55:48.010
Officer bloom?
You guys check over there.

55:48.012 --> 55:49.778
- Yeah.
- I don't see him.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.380
He's gotta be here.
Where else would he be?

55:51.382 --> 55:53.749
I don't know, but Randy said
if some shit like this happens,

55:53.751 --> 55:54.616
we gotta shoot him.

55:54.618 --> 55:56.919
He's a fuckin' cop.
We're gonna shoot him?

55:56.921 --> 56:00.823
I'm pretty sure
Randy knows that.

56:03.093 --> 56:07.663
Hey, skylar, you can't
just pull me around, man.

56:07.665 --> 56:08.497
Bullshit.

56:08.499 --> 56:10.766
You pulled me into this,
and I didn't know shit!

56:10.768 --> 56:12.868
Now I'm gonna go get
some fucking food

56:12.870 --> 56:17.539
and get
these fucking cuffs off!

56:18.708 --> 56:22.444
COME <i>ON!</i>

56:24.881 --> 56:30.085
What took you so long?
I'm starving.

56:30.087 --> 56:32.554
Take it easy. Take it easy!

56:32.556 --> 56:34.757
No!

56:34.759 --> 56:36.125
We're not here to hurt you.

56:36.127 --> 56:41.163
Just be cool, and everything
will be all right, okay?

56:42.699 --> 56:46.034
They're in the old cerini
house up on greenwalt road.

56:46.036 --> 56:47.536
We're outside.
What should we do?

56:47.538 --> 56:50.139
Just don't let 'em go.
I'm on my way.

56:50.141 --> 56:51.740
And stop saying where you are.

56:51.742 --> 56:54.943
Radio silence from now on.
That goes for everybody.

57:02.986 --> 57:05.687
Fuck!

57:05.689 --> 57:07.656
What's your name?

57:07.658 --> 57:09.691
Roroberta.

57:09.693 --> 57:11.927
Roberta, why don't you have
any food?

57:11.929 --> 57:13.228
Where's your food?

57:13.230 --> 57:16.532
I'mi'm waiting
for my fiance.

57:16.534 --> 57:17.466
He's getting pizza.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.902
He'll be here any minute,
I swear.

57:19.904 --> 57:22.805
Do you have a hacksaw
or an axe or anything?

57:22.807 --> 57:23.906
No. I don't know.

57:23.908 --> 57:25.707
Doesn't your boyfriend
have a toolbox?

57:25.709 --> 57:26.975
Anything? Nothing?
You have nothing?

57:26.977 --> 57:32.781
We don't live here.
It's just a vacation rental.

57:35.018 --> 57:36.084
There's nothing.

57:36.086 --> 57:40.656
Fuck this shit.
Let's get out of here.

57:42.860 --> 57:46.161
Hey, we got the place
surrounded... they're inside.

57:46.163 --> 57:49.064
No! No!

57:49.066 --> 57:52.100
- Where are the car keys, lady?
- Nate, easy.

57:52.102 --> 57:54.670
Where are the keys?
Where are the car keys?

57:54.672 --> 58:01.009
- What do we need keys for?
- We need a car, man.

58:01.011 --> 58:03.545
- Where are they?
- On the sofa.

58:03.547 --> 58:05.547
Lady, would you please,
just...

58:05.549 --> 58:10.018
Oh, my... seriously?

58:22.299 --> 58:24.766
Go!

58:34.878 --> 58:38.981
Go! Go, go, go, go!

58:38.983 --> 58:43.118
Come on, skylar, come on!

58:56.065 --> 58:58.934
Come on, sky.

59:12.081 --> 59:14.650
Nate, grenade. The grenade.

59:14.652 --> 59:17.619
Oh, shit.

59:20.690 --> 59:22.291
Go to the right.
Go to the right.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.084
Come on.

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:30.252
You can give 'em a head start,

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:33.355
but you know
what's gonna happen.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:35.957
Randy ain't gonna quit.

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:36.925
We'll find 'em.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.193
I'm gonna turn around
now, Lloyd.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.028
I don't believe you're gonna
shoot me in the back,

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:46.101
but if you feel you need to,
go ahead.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.947
What the fuck you doing,
Lloyd?

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:00.916
It's bloom.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:05.187
You have a shot?

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:11.460
You had a shot,
and you let towne go?

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:13.829
All right, Eric,
you're drmng.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:16.498
What's the next road down
from here?

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.866
- Fullam.
- All right.

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.501
Get the boys together.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:22.070
I want fullam road covered.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.806
You're a moron.

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.952
What's going on?

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:54.996
Let's take five.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.466
Chopper will spot 'em
before we ever do anyway.

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:01.403
What is it, Saturday?

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.270
- Yep.
- Yep.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:04.072
There goes
the fuckin' weekend, huh?

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.174
I wish somebody'd put these
fuckers out of their misery.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.944
You know? That's the only way
this is gonna end.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:11.213
Let's just get it
over with already.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:14.316
I'd rather be out here
than at the gas station any day.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.952
Get ahold
of those two little maggots

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:18.253
and rip their little heads off.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:19.421
Give me one of those bagels.

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:21.423
I'm gonna string 'em up
like mussolini,

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:22.157
by their balls.

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:25.260
Shave their bodies, strap 'em
to the hood of my car

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:26.528
like a couple of trophies,

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.997
drive around town
till their bodies rot off.

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:34.636
That's fucked up.
Can I get a juice box?

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.406
Shit, skip,
you got any more bagels?

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:41.910
No, man, that's it.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.249
Holy shit!

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:50.485
Get my gun! Get 'em!

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:53.021
Services begin at 11:00

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:53.922
and continue all day.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:55.423
The spaghetti feed
in dick's honor...

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:57.993
Will be hosted
by dick's brother Randy

01:04:57.995 --> 01:04:59.961
at the town hall at 6:00.

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:05.066
Okay, you're listening
to the morning breeze...

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:57.118
You're a fucking asshole, man.
I hope you know that.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.253
If we ever get these cuffs off,

01:05:58.255 --> 01:05:59.521
I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass!

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.156
See,
that's why I didn't tell you.

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:02.490
You don't get it.
Get it-what?

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:06.494
You know what they did,
and you're still mad at me.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:11.266
You're the asshole!

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:12.334
You're unbelievable, man.

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:14.436
You hate dad so much,
but you're just like him.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:15.770
You let the cavanaughs
ruin your life.

01:06:15.772 --> 01:06:17.405
That's bullshit, skylar,
and you know it.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:22.711
You're bullshit, and now
you're just as bad as them.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:45.200
Easy. Get up.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:48.570
Turn around real slowly.

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:52.374
Come on, towne.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:03.485
You're sloppy, towne.

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:06.421
You're a sloppy cop
and a sloppy outlaw.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:08.490
That chopper spotted you
on the first pass.

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:13.061
I'm no outlaw.
I'm just here for my boys.

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:15.196
I'm gonna count to three...

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.631
And I want you
to drop your gun.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:20.135
Randy, you know
I can't walk away from this.

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:25.106
You've done it before.
You're good at it.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:26.508
Yeah.

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:30.311
One...

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:36.317
You punk. Three.

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:37.819
Aah!

01:07:57.873 --> 01:08:01.643
Randy.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.653
Fuck.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.643
If you're having a hard time

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:37.879
hearing the breeze
this morning,

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:38.813
you are not alone.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:43.852
We got a low-flying chopper
buzzing the neighborhood.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:26.327
We're gonna have
to cross the river again.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.595
No, fuck that.
They'll see us.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.863
We gotta get to the barn.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.332
No, fuck that, man.
We gotta keep going.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:33.667
We can cross right there.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.370
- We're not crossing the river.
- Skylar, come on.

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:36.470
There's someone over there.

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:37.705
We're not going over there.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:38.606
Skylar, come on.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:42.877
What the fuck is going on?
Who's over there?

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.279
Let's go, skylar.

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:48.683
Nate?

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.219
What is that?

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.921
Hey. Yeah, it's me.

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:55.223
We're just across the river.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:10:00.461
We'll be there
in a minute, okay?

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:01.863
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:05.867
You had a fucking phone?

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:07.368
Jamie's coming with us.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.771
- What?
- She loves me.

01:10:09.773 --> 01:10:11.005
She wants to come.

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:12.507
No. Bullshit!

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:15.410
We're not going over there.
This is bullshit!

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.578
- Skylar.
- Nate!

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:17.579
Listen to me!

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:20.915
We're not going anywhere
if you don't cross that bridge.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:26.020
I'll just sit down.

01:10:26.022 --> 01:10:27.388
You fucker.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.958
She's got a car.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.927
Shit!

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:11.299
Damn it! Get down!

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:13.067
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:17.805
She screwed us, Nate.
She fuckin' screwed us.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:23.311
Okay, sky, we're going over.
Come on, man.

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.880
- No! No!
- We're going over.

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:28.349
What the fuck are you doing?

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:31.519
- Put your arms up.
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.354
Fuck no!

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:35.590
We are not gmng up!

01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:37.558
I know you think
I fucked you over, man,

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.726
but you gotta trust me.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:41.929
They're not gonna let us
off this bridge alive.

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:44.699
All right, wait here.

01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:47.669
- Hey! I said hold your fire.
- Come on.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:50.672
Come on, sky. You can do it.

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:52.407
We have to.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:57.345
Skylar, Nate, no!

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:04.385
We've got to, sky.
We don't have a choice, skylar.

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.737
Right here?

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:34.082
The truck's here.
Let's go, come on.

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:37.385
You see that?

01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:45.393
Been down there a long time.

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.464
No way they made that.

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:53.668
Check the other side?
They're gone.

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:11.119
Look, there. Right there.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:17.024
Come on, guys, let's go.
Come on.

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:28.202
Hey, this is tom.

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:30.738
I'm at the bottom
of caz highway.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.773
Has anybody seen Randy?

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:36.144
He was supposed
to meet me here.

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:49.891
Aah! Oh, God!

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:56.164
Oh, that hurts.

01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:59.467
Oh, my God, it hurts.

01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:10.077
Oh, please.

01:14:11.514 --> 01:14:15.082
Skylar? Oh, my God.

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.986
- Come here. Come here.
- Aah!

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:21.122
Shit.

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.857
I thought
you were coming alone.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.892
I did. I swear.

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.227
I don't know what happened.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:27.261
- Swear to God.
- Nate...

01:14:27.263 --> 01:14:31.499
- Swear you didn't bring them.
- I swear.

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.635
Sky, you okay? Can you move?

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:38.206
Can you move?

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.759
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:01.929
Oh, shit. Sky?

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:06.067
Jamie, I need your shirt.
Do you mind?

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:14.108
Cut the shirt in two.
We gotta stop this bleeding.

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.610
Nate...

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:19.547
Well, take the handcuffs off.

01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:22.750
You're no good
with one hand tied.

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:23.184
Here.

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:24.685
- Tie it around his leg.
- Yeah.

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:28.089
- Up above the...
- Okay. Okay.

01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:30.157
That's good. That's good.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:50.578
Hold your fire.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:55.750
Jamie's in there.

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:09.196
There are a lot of men
out there.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:10.097
We got this far.

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:12.633
We need to start thinking
about an exit strategy.

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:16.237
You came all this way
to tell us to quit?

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.205
You've wasted your time.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.841
- Nate.
- What, skylar?

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:24.178
I have a bullet in my leg.
I can't even walk.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.748
Maybe he's right, Nate.

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.987
Bloom...

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:33.988
It's Lloyd.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:38.793
Can you tell me
what you're doing in there?

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:43.764
I'm having a little talk
with my boys, Lloyd.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:46.701
Now, we're gonna come walking
out of here in just a minute.

01:16:46.703 --> 01:16:49.003
Why don't you
send Jamie out first?

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:50.738
Say whatever you want, dad.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.342
We're not walking out of here.

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:56.043
Why don't we just let her go?

01:16:56.045 --> 01:17:00.748
She came on her own.
I didn't force her to come.

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:03.618
Jamie, you wanna go?

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:07.688
Bloom, we don't have
a lot of time.

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:10.891
Now, if you and boys
are holding Jamie hostage...

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:12.693
- Hey, wait, Lloyd...

01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:14.095
Lloyd, there's no hostage here.

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:16.897
Jamie came in here
on her own, all right?

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:19.767
You just... you have to give me
a minute or two.

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:23.371
All right,
you got two minutes.

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:28.943
You heard him, two minutes.
What's it gonna be?

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:32.747
Nate.

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.949
Fine. Why don't you
just turn yourself in?

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:40.087
You didn't do anything.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:42.390
Oh, what does it matter now?
I shot dick.

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:46.894
Skylar didn't do shit.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.898
What? You hated him.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.201
You wished he'd drink himself
to death. Remember?

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:56.704
Well...

01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:58.873
I didn't hate him.

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:01.308
They're gonna shoot us.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.177
Yeah.
Yeah, they're gonna try.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:05.312
They're gonna try
to fucking kill us.

01:18:05.314 --> 01:18:06.113
- Nate!
- What?

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:10.284
It's true, dad,
and you know it.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.386
You got one minute.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:16.123
Jamie.

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:20.928
Jamie?

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.031
No. No.

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.966
Oh, fuck.

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:27.468
Jamie, sweetie, listen to me.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.471
We're gonna walk out
of here, okay?

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:33.274
Have Lloyd come in.

01:18:33.276 --> 01:18:38.079
If he comes in here,
I'll go out with him.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:47.988
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Yeah?

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.491
How would you feel
about coming in here

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:54.395
and escorting us out?

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.029
Why?

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:59.900
You come in here,
and we'll go out with you.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:05.372
The boys have already
killed two cops.

01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:10.511
What's stopping them
from killing one more?

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:25.059
Me.

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:41.375
All right, I'm coming in.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:46.981
Hey, Lloyd,
why don't you take off your gun,

01:19:46.983 --> 01:19:53.020
so we don't have
another accident?

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:56.223
Good.

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:06.233
Shut the fucking door, Lloyd.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.340
Holy shit.

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:16.844
Holy... oh, God.

01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:18.078
Jamie, are you okay?

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.114
They didn't kidnap me.
I came on my own.

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:24.151
Yeah. I know. I followed you.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:25.853
Hey. Nate!

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:27.321
- You cocksucker!
- Nate!

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:31.325
- He killed Uncle Mike!
- Nate, it's over.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:36.263
Just let it go.
Let's get out of here.

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:39.900
Is this
why you brought me in here?

01:20:39.902 --> 01:20:43.604
To kill me?

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:47.341
Nate, let's stick
with the plan.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:50.911
WE MADE A DEAL.
<i>YOU</i> MADE A DEAL!

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:54.949
I know you're mad, Nate.

01:20:54.951 --> 01:21:00.254
I know why you're mad.

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:03.958
But you brought this thing
to a fever pitch.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.059
You made it this way.

01:21:05.061 --> 01:21:09.129
Now you have a chance
to get out of here alive.

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:11.599
One chance.

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:13.267
So how about it?

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:16.403
Do you want to live?

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.651
You take Jamie out first.

01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:33.387
Then dad and skylar and me.

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.155
Wait, no, Nate, Nate,
you should go out with skylar.

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:37.224
I'll go out with Jamie last.
Make sure you two...

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:39.293
- No. No.
Lloyd takes Jamie out.

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:41.362
- Nate...
- Dad, I'm not fucking around!

01:21:41.364 --> 01:21:45.266
Jamie goes with Lloyd.
Then, once they're out,

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:47.234
you help skylar.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.036
What about you?

01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:52.640
I'm last.

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:03.550
We're coming out,
me and Jamie.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:11.525
Go, go. Take her in your car.
Get her home.

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.629
I got some bad news.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:20.067
Randy's dead. Bloom shot him.

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:42.589
What the fuck, man?
She was our ticket out of here.

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:47.294
I didn't want her
to get hurt.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.101
These assholes
are gonna kill us.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:57.604
Right here, one way or another.

01:22:57.606 --> 01:23:02.009
They're not taking us
back to town.

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:07.314
Nate,
you better give me my gun.

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:11.018
We don't have a choice.

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.387
You don't have a choice!

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:16.056
We didn't sell our souls
to the cavanaughs!

01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:19.526
We don't have to do
what they say.

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:20.694
What choice do we have?

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:25.099
Nate, they're gonna come in here
one way or the other.

01:23:25.101 --> 01:23:28.702
How do we know
they're not gonna shoot us

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:31.338
if we go out?

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.141
Because Lloyd gave me
his word.

01:23:34.143 --> 01:23:38.512
LLOYD IS A <i>CAVANAUGH,</i> DAD!

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:39.713
And you know as well as I do

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:43.784
that this is gonna end
right here!

01:23:43.786 --> 01:23:45.552
You either go out there

01:23:45.554 --> 01:23:50.357
and lick their boots...

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:52.626
Fuck it.

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:57.398
You don't have the balls.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:14.549
Dad?

01:24:18.454 --> 01:24:22.389
Did dick kill mom?

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:42.743
Bloom, it's time.
