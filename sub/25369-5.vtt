WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:05.130
Whoo‐hoo!

00:07.007 --> 00:09.384
A view like this would make
anybody feel like a hero.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.096
<i>[J. Jonah Jameson]</i>
<i>Breaking news!</i>

00:13.096 --> 00:14.723
<i>And I do mean "breaking."</i>

00:14.723 --> 00:16.808
<i>As the Big Apple's own</i>
<i>mighty Avengers</i>

00:16.808 --> 00:19.186
<i>bash their way through</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:21.188

Aah!

00:31.615 --> 00:33.617
<i>Leave it to Tony Stark</i>

00:33.617 --> 00:37.246

00:37.246 --> 00:39.122
Hey, menace, move along

00:39.122 --> 00:41.416
before Stark comes down
to deal with you.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.085
Ohh.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.212
Thanks to J. Jonah Jameson
at the <i>Daily Bugle,</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:46.755
my reputation
is in the Dumpster.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.007
If only some
of that Avengers glow

00:49.007 --> 00:50.592
could rub off on me.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.178
Huh? I didn't mean
literal glow.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.263
What's going on here?

00:55.264 --> 00:56.348
How about you

00:56.348 --> 00:58.183
pick on someone
your own size?

00:58.183 --> 00:59.476
Or me, in this case.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.520
She tried to zap me!

01:01.520 --> 01:03.522
[gasping]
Huh?

01:03.522 --> 01:04.773
It's the tubes.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.984
237. Yeah. Yeah, yeah...

01:06.984 --> 01:08.193
The power...

01:09.361 --> 01:10.946
Aah!

01:14.074 --> 01:16.493
Yo, I'm out!
[panting]

01:16.493 --> 01:18.287
Can't...stop...

01:18.287 --> 01:19.830
237!

01:19.830 --> 01:22.249
So‐‐ So much power!

01:22.249 --> 01:23.959
Yaah!

01:24.960 --> 01:26.461
Are you okay?

01:26.461 --> 01:28.672
Not that I don't appreciate
an electric personality,

01:28.672 --> 01:30.048
but someone's
gonna get hurt.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.009
I've been chosen for 237.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.260
Testing special project...

01:33.260 --> 01:34.469
Extra credit...

01:34.469 --> 01:35.512
Uhh!

01:37.180 --> 01:38.181
Okay.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.350
I guess making sense
is overrated.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.518
Must‐‐
Whoop!

01:41.518 --> 01:43.228
...pass test!

01:45.105 --> 01:47.149
Wait. This is part
of some test?

01:47.149 --> 01:49.192
If so, can we skip
to the essay portion?

01:49.192 --> 01:50.610
It's probably
less dangerous.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.362
Aah!

01:52.362 --> 01:54.072
[crying]
Hey.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.824
Freaky,
super‐strong teenager

01:55.824 --> 01:58.243
with crazy eyes
and energy blasts.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.037
Okay, I got this.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.246
Aah!

02:01.246 --> 02:04.041
[roaring]
Whoa! Whoa!

02:06.626 --> 02:09.129
Aah!

02:09.129 --> 02:10.797
I don't got this!

02:23.060 --> 02:25.520
Got to thwip this
with absolute precision.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.191
[gasping]

02:38.200 --> 02:39.868
Hey, everyone.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.663
Uh...what's up?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.955
[girl groaning]

02:43.955 --> 02:46.375
No one appreciates
a solid pun.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.502
I'll wrap you up
nice and tight

02:48.502 --> 02:49.753
for when the police
come, okay?

02:49.753 --> 02:50.962
237...
[grunts]

02:50.962 --> 02:52.255
237...

02:52.255 --> 02:55.175
Still with this "237" thing?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.343
Huh?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.180
She's a student.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.265
The Bilderberg Academy?

03:02.265 --> 03:05.185
Could 237 be
a locker number or something?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.145
Time to investigate.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.900
Hey, uh,
I just wanted to pop in

03:11.900 --> 03:13.360
and give this back
to my cousin.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.237
She left it at my house.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.491
Nobody pops into
the Bilderberg Academy.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.618
Oh, uh, right.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.209
[guard] Morning,
Headmaster Rappaccini.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.839
Good morning, Don.
How's little Margie?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.257
Over the flu?

03:35.257 --> 03:37.676
Just fine.
Thank you, ma'am.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.603
Come on, Douglas. I don't
know why you weren't picked.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.439
I don't do the selections.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.400
Uh‐‐ ahem.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.861
Hey, as a Student
Safety Monitor,

03:55.861 --> 03:57.320
I'm just doing my job
and making sure

03:57.320 --> 03:59.281
my fellow students
like you

03:59.281 --> 04:01.116
get to class,
you know,

04:01.116 --> 04:02.701
[whimpering]
safely.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.787
Hey. Whew. Boy, am I
glad I found you guys.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.414
I am so lost.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.333
Who are you?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.960
Where's your uniform?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.545
Oh, uh, sorry. I'm new.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.589
I was just trying
to figure out where to go,

04:15.589 --> 04:17.674
and I heard you say
how it's your job.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.342
You need to report
to the supply hall

04:19.342 --> 04:21.136
and get your uniform
ASAP.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.387
I'll take him.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.932
Thanks.
I'm Grady.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.225
Grady Scraps.

04:27.225 --> 04:30.437
I'm, uh, Park.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.063
Park Peterson.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.565
Huh. Weird name.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.066
Hmph.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.986
[chatter]

04:37.986 --> 04:40.030
No, no, no.
I wouldn't say "picked on."

04:40.030 --> 04:41.448
Everyone's just jealous

04:41.448 --> 04:43.366
because Headmaster Rappaccini
and I are tight.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.661
Whenever there's a special
project, I'm her first call.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.873
Wow.
Special projects like?

04:49.873 --> 04:51.458
Here's the supply hall.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.418
Just flash your ID,
and they'll hook you up.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.712
Oh‐ho, ohh.
[chuckles]

04:55.712 --> 04:57.506
Guess what I left
in my room.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.049
Don't sweat it.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.801
I'm kind of a big deal
around here.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.511
[door opens, closes]

05:02.511 --> 05:05.013
Locker numbers.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.473
All five digits.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.683
There goes my 2‐3‐7 theory.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.437
[chatter]

05:13.855 --> 05:16.358
Here. Put that on,

05:16.358 --> 05:17.734
and you won't have to worry
about any uniform

05:17.734 --> 05:19.402
demerits.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.570
Okay. Thanks.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.073
Well, I don't want
to keep you, so...

05:23.073 --> 05:25.659
Oh, please. You helped me out
with Douglas.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.537
The least I can do
is give you a personal tour.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.665
[Grady]
I know what you're thinking‐‐

05:31.665 --> 05:33.333
best library ever.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.883
This is my secret
thinking spot.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.887
Oh. I can see Headmaster
Rappaccini down there.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.764
Hi!

05:47.764 --> 05:50.642
<i>[thinking]</i>
<i>So much for keeping</i>
<i>a low profile.</i>

05:50.642 --> 05:54.396
Sure, my experiment
shot smelly green
goop all over,

05:54.396 --> 05:56.565
but they didn't have
to be mean about it.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.360
Wow. Huh. Feels good
to get this off my chest.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.070
Thanks, man. You get me.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.321
Wait. What's in there?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.532
Yeah, no.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.367
Room 237's off‐limits.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.702
I mean, not for me

06:08.702 --> 06:10.662
and a couple other
elite kids.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.456
That's where the special,
special projects happen.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.586
[Spider‐Man]
Room 237's right inside there.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.797
Time for a stakeout.
Exciting!

06:20.797 --> 06:22.424
Exciting.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.301
Exciting.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.429
Pshew!

06:27.429 --> 06:28.889
Pshew. Pshew.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.515
Pshew, pshew, pshew.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.892
Pshew pshew pshew
pshew pshew.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.646
Exciting...

06:36.646 --> 06:38.481
[gasps]

06:38.481 --> 06:40.525

06:40.525 --> 06:41.610
[snoring]

06:43.361 --> 06:44.487
[sighs]

06:44.487 --> 06:45.947
What am I expecting here?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.449
Another teen
with crazy super‐powers

06:47.449 --> 06:48.825
to just pop by?

06:51.453 --> 06:52.537
[grunts]

06:52.537 --> 06:55.415
And a teen with crazy
super‐powers.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.543
Careful what you wish for.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.301
Okay. Looks like I lost
sneaky power teen already.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.596
I wait three hours
with no snacks

07:09.596 --> 07:11.431
to find a clue,
and the first thing I do is‐‐

07:11.431 --> 07:12.390
Uhh!

07:12.390 --> 07:14.434
Every bug's worst nightmare.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.687
Stop making so much noise.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.980
Ms. Marvel?

07:18.980 --> 07:20.065
Call Tony.
[phone ringing]

07:20.065 --> 07:22.067
<i>The</i> Ms. Marvel?
[gasps]

07:22.067 --> 07:24.027
I've seen you.
Oh, you're great.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.571
Are you calling Tony Stark?
Because I totally know him.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.614
We teamed up once.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.199
[ringing continues]

07:29.199 --> 07:30.867
<i>Kind of busy running point</i>

<i>even I don't know</i>
<i>where they are.</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:36.665
I've got a tagalong‐‐
Spider‐Man.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.291
He must be that weird kid

07:38.291 --> 07:40.210
I saw scouting out
the school today.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.629
<i>Spider‐Man?</i>
<i>Are you sure it's him?</i>

07:42.629 --> 07:44.547
Webs, tights, annoying?

07:44.547 --> 07:47.050
<i>Totally him. Put PJ's on.</i>

07:47.050 --> 07:49.427
Tony? Hey. Hi. It's me.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.429
There was this girl with powers
who went to this school,

07:51.429 --> 07:52.722
and she was all, "237,"

07:52.722 --> 07:54.724
and I was all,
"Is that a locker number?" and‐‐

07:54.724 --> 07:56.976
<i>Look, kid, I don't have</i>
<i>time to sort this out.</i>

07:56.976 --> 07:58.436
<i>Ms. Marvel's</i>
<i>on Avengers business,</i>

07:58.436 --> 08:00.522
<i>so I guess you are now, too.</i>

08:00.522 --> 08:02.565
[both]
Wait. What?

08:02.565 --> 08:04.526
Are you saying
I'm an Avenger?

08:04.526 --> 08:05.568
<i>No.</i>
No.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.112
Listen, Tony,

08:07.112 --> 08:09.280
for someone who is
apparently undercover,

08:09.280 --> 08:10.573
he didn't‐‐
Oh. I'm super stealthy.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.866
Hey. Quit it.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.410
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>Telling PJ's to scram</i>

08:13.410 --> 08:14.619
<i>won't get us anywhere.</i>

08:14.619 --> 08:16.079
<i>He's just as eager as you,</i>

08:16.079 --> 08:18.164
<i>so make the best of it, okay?</i>

08:18.164 --> 08:20.625
<i>Besides, two heads</i>
<i>are better, right?</i>

08:20.625 --> 08:21.668
<i>Play nice.</i>

08:22.669 --> 08:24.129
Uhh!

08:24.129 --> 08:26.172
So, uh,
you guys are looking into

08:26.172 --> 08:27.757
the crazy super‐teen,
too, huh?

08:29.884 --> 08:32.595
Super strong with these,
uh, energy blasts.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.973
Which would all be cool
if she wasn't babbling
like a crazy person.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.182
You know
what that's like?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.475
I can imagine.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.978
[gasps]
Whoa.
[grunts]

08:39.978 --> 08:41.479
[chatter]

08:45.525 --> 08:47.235

intercepted chatter

08:56.619 --> 08:58.204
about an experimental
weapons program

08:58.204 --> 08:59.789
being somehow
linked to this school.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.708
This is the only place
at Bilderberg

09:01.708 --> 09:03.043
I haven't been able
to check out yet.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.512
[Ms. Marvel]
Bilderberg is a front for AIM?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.431
[Spider‐Man]
Advanced Idea Mechanics‐‐

09:16.431 --> 09:19.267
that team of super‐science
bad guys?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.644
I've taken some
of them down before.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.855
Iron Man is gonna be
so impressed with me.

09:23.855 --> 09:24.898
With you?

09:26.149 --> 09:27.442
[Spider‐Man]
Whoops.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.904

Halt! We've got you!

09:33.907 --> 09:35.950

09:35.950 --> 09:38.661

would be impressed?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.542

evil science fair or something.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.637
Don't.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.263
What? You heard
that one before?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.564
Quick,
take off your costume.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.274
Um, uh, what?

10:09.609 --> 10:10.777
The bad guys are looking

10:10.777 --> 10:13.196
for Spider‐Man
and Ms. Marvel.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.156
Ohh!

10:15.156 --> 10:16.199
I get it.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.575
Secure the perimeter.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.619
Lock down the south
and west gates,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.746
and leave no stone
unturned.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.253
Now, now.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.505
One foot apart,
lovebirds.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.763
[sighs]
That was close.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.306
Yes, we were. Heh.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.891
I mean, i‐it was.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.769
Look, sorry about being a jerk
when we were talking to Tony,

10:44.769 --> 10:47.772
but this was supposed to be
my first Avenger solo mission,

10:47.772 --> 10:49.774
and I wasn't really counting
on a sidekick.

10:51.526 --> 10:52.652
That's okay.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.737
[dialing]

10:54.737 --> 10:56.197
We actually make
a pretty good team.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.240
I‐‐

10:57.240 --> 10:58.825
Wait. Sidekick?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.745
I can't believe AIM
is running this school.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.206
We've got to tell Tony.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.168
Yes. We should totally
call for backup

11:08.168 --> 11:10.295
and definitely not figure out

11:10.295 --> 11:12.172
what AIM is up to
by ourselves,

11:12.172 --> 11:14.841
even though that
would be the most epic
first solo mission ever.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.635
Technically, it's not
a solo mission anymore,

11:17.635 --> 11:20.221
but I like the way
you think.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.682
Okay. Step 1‐‐

11:22.682 --> 11:25.101
get back into AIM's
high‐security
underground lair

11:25.101 --> 11:27.687
so we can get our eyes
on whatever AIM's
special project is.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.733
Which we can't do
without one of those
all‐access swipey IDs.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.861
I might know a guy.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.697
So, being an Avenger‐‐

11:37.697 --> 11:39.365
that's got to be great, right?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.743
Like the part where people
don't hurl insults at you

11:41.743 --> 11:43.036
while you're saving them.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.872
Oh, sure.
It's always roses.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.373
Like when your every move

11:47.373 --> 11:49.250
gets compared
to a prince of Asgard

11:49.250 --> 11:51.711
and the literal
Captain of America.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.088
Plus, I love
always following orders

11:54.088 --> 11:56.216
and never doing my own thing.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.551
Sorry.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.677
But for what it's worth,

11:59.677 --> 12:01.679
I'm excited to be
working with you.

12:01.679 --> 12:05.308
Uh, because you're
a good superhero.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.643
That's the only reason.
[beeping]

12:06.643 --> 12:07.769
Found him.

12:19.781 --> 12:20.823
Ugh.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.751
Who is it?

12:33.378 --> 12:35.755
Huh. I guess no one.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.383
[knock on door]

12:39.926 --> 12:42.595
Guys, stop messing around.
I'm trying to work.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.888
Oh. Headmaster.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.265
We need to bring
the remaining candidates

12:45.265 --> 12:46.891
online now.

12:46.891 --> 12:50.395
B‐But the DNA sequencing
isn't ready.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.814
We'll have the same
problem as last time.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.733
Grady, hostiles have been
spotted on campus.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.235
If we don't do this now,

12:57.235 --> 12:59.404
all the progress
we've worked for is at risk.

12:59.404 --> 13:03.324
I‐I guess I can try to make
adjustments on the fly.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.996
What? Douglas?

13:07.996 --> 13:10.957
He is definitely
not ready.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.709
Hey, it's like
you said, Grady.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.794
You don't pick the candidates.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.673
I guess after tonight,
you won't be the only
special one around here.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.757
[scanner beeps]

13:30.601 --> 13:32.979
You two are the last
feasible candidates.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.773
Unfortunately,
we must move forward

13:35.773 --> 13:38.985
before the procedure
can be perfectly
aligned to your DNA.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.445
But I'm confident

13:40.445 --> 13:42.030
at least one of you
will emerge

13:42.030 --> 13:43.990
as the new vanguard
of AIM's forces.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.409
AIM is experimenting
on students?

13:46.409 --> 13:48.786
Guess I was right about
the evil science fair.

13:48.786 --> 13:52.206
I'm worried about injury
to the volunteers.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.959
I'll let you know
when you should be
worrying, Mr. Scraps.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.507
[Spider‐Man]
Hulk, Captain Marvel,
and Captain America?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.509
What is AIM
doing to them?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.178
We've got to help them.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.637
We can't just rush in.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.805
We'd never make it
to them.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.892
Initiate energy transfer
on my mark.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.185
Mark!

14:18.066 --> 14:20.443
[groaning]

14:21.444 --> 14:23.112
I'm...so...

14:24.572 --> 14:26.240
buff!

14:26.240 --> 14:27.992
[laughing]

14:27.992 --> 14:30.453
Pretty sure the school board
wouldn't approve of this.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.210
[Ms. Marvel]
This just got really real.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.338
Avengers emergency
distress signal engaged.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.756
We're deep underground.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.424
You sure Tony's gonna
get that signal?

14:43.424 --> 14:44.926
Hope so,
'cause the odds are slim

14:44.926 --> 14:46.636
that you and I can
take out these AIM guys,

14:46.636 --> 14:49.889
plus Douglas with the powers
of two Captains and a Hulk.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.684
Yeah, but if backup
might not be coming
from the outside,

14:53.684 --> 14:56.062
then let's round up
some backup from in here.

14:58.189 --> 15:02.443
So...much...power...

15:02.443 --> 15:05.696
He's going to lose control,
just like the last one.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.116
Focus, Douglas.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.201
You are an initiate of AIM.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.869
You will fight
the forces of ignorance

15:11.869 --> 15:13.955
that undermine our progress.

15:13.955 --> 15:17.041
Now show us what you can do.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.126
[chuckling]

15:25.091 --> 15:27.051
That guy Douglas‐‐
I met him.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.262
He was a bully
even before he got powers.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.972
Prepare the chamber again.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.432
But our volunteers'
vitals are low.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.809
If I had more time‐‐

15:34.809 --> 15:36.769
Time is a luxury
we don't have.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.025
If we detach the power,
we might be able
to get them free.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.945
Sticking your noses into
other people's business?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.823
Around here, that earns you
a beatdown.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.825
Spider‐Man?
Ms. Marvel?

15:50.825 --> 15:53.411
Were they trying
to free the subjects?
What's going on?

15:53.411 --> 15:56.622
Ignore them. Initiate
the energy transfer now!

15:56.622 --> 15:57.999
But don't those two know

15:57.999 --> 16:00.710
the Avengers volunteered
for this research?

16:00.710 --> 16:03.296
Progress always has
its enemies, Mr. Scraps.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.339
Focus on your work.
[grunts]

16:08.509 --> 16:11.762
Hey, Douglas,
eat superhero team‐up.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.681
I never liked that guy.
[groaning]

16:13.681 --> 16:16.058
You fools cannot stop me‐‐

16:16.058 --> 16:18.477
the Scientist Supreme,

16:18.477 --> 16:20.730
leader of AIM.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.402
More like "scientist
supremely aggravating."

16:26.402 --> 16:28.154
Haah!

16:33.993 --> 16:38.164
Try to get them out of there.
I'll cover you. Slap!

16:38.164 --> 16:40.166
An Avenger is covering me
in battle!

16:40.166 --> 16:44.128
That's got to automatically
make me at least half‐Avenger
by default, right?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.172
Quarter?

16:46.172 --> 16:48.299
[screaming]

16:49.717 --> 16:51.177
[groaning]

16:51.177 --> 16:55.056
[grunts]
Subject number 2. Perfect.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.308
Destroy the intruders!

17:00.853 --> 17:02.521
What with all
the impending doom,

17:02.521 --> 17:04.023
I should just
let you know now,

17:04.023 --> 17:05.650
it was cool working with you.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.361
Back at ya. Embiggen!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.322
[crash]

17:11.322 --> 17:13.658
Hey, want to be friends?

17:13.658 --> 17:15.076
Whoa! Guess not.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.247
Your loss.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.498
[shouting]

17:20.498 --> 17:22.041
You're no match
for AIM, you fool!

17:23.459 --> 17:25.127
Maybe not alone, but‐‐

17:25.127 --> 17:27.129
Superhero smackdown!

17:30.967 --> 17:32.051
[groans]

17:32.051 --> 17:35.012
AIM, box them in. Pour it on!

17:36.430 --> 17:38.140
Kid, you seem
like an okay guy.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.976
How'd you get wrapped up
with criminals like AIM?

17:39.976 --> 17:42.853
AIM is a criminal
organization?

17:42.853 --> 17:44.480
They said
they were scientists.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.190
Trust me.
You can be both.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.027
Oh, man. I thought
I was doing a good thing.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.114
Maybe getting some extra
credit out of it, too.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.574
Okay, so you wound up

17:54.574 --> 17:57.034
turning your classmates
into evil super weapons.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.786
How do we undo it?

17:58.786 --> 18:00.621
Get them into the chamber,

18:00.621 --> 18:02.915
and I'll try
to reverse the process.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.250
Yaah!

18:04.250 --> 18:05.751
I think not.

18:06.877 --> 18:07.962
Aah!

18:09.088 --> 18:10.256
What are you doing?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.424
It's not calibrated for me!

18:16.220 --> 18:18.598
Yaah!

18:18.598 --> 18:21.183
Grady! We'll get you
out of there, buddy!

18:31.736 --> 18:34.238
Ugh!
His DNA is not a match!

18:34.238 --> 18:38.117
Aah!

18:38.117 --> 18:40.411
Aah!

18:42.121 --> 18:43.664
[Spider‐Man]
Before Grady recovers,

18:43.664 --> 18:45.333
get Super Kids 1 and 2
into the chamber,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.209
and I'll try to send
the power back upstream.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.881
"Sending power
back upstream"

18:51.881 --> 18:53.257
does not sound
like real science.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.718
Whoa!

18:57.219 --> 18:59.805
I think‐‐
I think that's it!

18:59.805 --> 19:01.057
Where's my extra credit?

19:13.444 --> 19:15.196
[all groaning]

19:15.196 --> 19:16.364
Guys, are you okay?

19:16.364 --> 19:17.323
Hulk! Big guy!

19:17.323 --> 19:19.241
You may have stopped
this operation,

19:19.241 --> 19:20.743
but now we have the two of you

19:20.743 --> 19:23.204
to add to our experiment!
Aah!

19:23.204 --> 19:24.789
Stop talking.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.624
Thank you, Ms. Marvel.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.962
Somebody send
a distress signal?

19:31.962 --> 19:35.716
Yeah. I'd say
villain class
is dismissed.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.307
If I knew what was going on,

19:43.307 --> 19:45.434
I would never
have been a part of it.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.229
It's not like Headmaster
Rappaccini said, "Hey,

19:48.229 --> 19:50.106
do you want to imprison
the Avengers?"

19:50.106 --> 19:52.400
Because my answer
would have been, "No way!"

19:52.400 --> 19:54.902
Wha‐‐ What's going on?

19:54.902 --> 19:56.612
Your school was a front
for a mad scientist

19:56.612 --> 19:58.239
trying to take over the world.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.574
Bad news‐‐ some of your
teachers were evil.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.327
Good news‐‐ you'll probably
get a couple days off.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.872
Yeah! Hey! Yeah!
All right!
Whoo‐hoo!

20:08.416 --> 20:11.377
So, maybe not the solo
mission I was hoping for,

20:11.377 --> 20:14.797
but, as team‐ups go,
you make a great sidekick.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.341
Well, I just‐‐

20:17.341 --> 20:20.094
Wait.
I'm nobody's sidekick!

20:20.094 --> 20:21.762
If the Avengers
ever need any help

20:21.762 --> 20:23.264
with their computer systems,

20:23.264 --> 20:25.015
I've kind of got
some free time now.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.184
Thanks, but between
Tony Stark and Bruce Banner,

20:27.184 --> 20:28.769
we're kind of covered.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.066
Whoa!
Ohh!

20:34.066 --> 20:36.736
Yeah. Got to say,
your team is impressive.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.820
Come on.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.866
Okay, everybody.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.534
Smile!

20:43.534 --> 20:44.910
Photo bomb!

20:44.910 --> 20:45.911
[timer trills]

20:45.911 --> 20:46.912
[shutter clicks]

20:56.130 --> 20:57.214
Huh?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.384
"Thanks for the assist.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.511
"For a menace, you make
a pretty decent hero,

21:02.511 --> 21:05.347
"and an even better friend.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.933
Best, Ms. M."

21:07.933 --> 21:10.561
You, sir, are friends
with Avengers.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.939
"P.S. Check out
today's newspaper.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.775
Should help with your image."

21:15.775 --> 21:19.153
[panting]

21:22.573 --> 21:25.743
I bet a headline about Spidey
becoming the Avengers' BFF

21:25.743 --> 21:27.578
will do wonders for my rep.
[gasps]

21:27.578 --> 21:29.038
Oh, come on!
