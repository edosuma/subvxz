WEBVTT

00:10.959 --> 00:12.583
(male #1)
'Sixty seconds to air!'

00:12.667 --> 00:15.166
- Where's America's sweetheart?
- Everett.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.291
Where's Everett?
Has anyone seen Everett?

00:17.375 --> 00:20.625
Keep your pants on, Kravet.
I'm right here.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.041
Sixty seconds
till we go
live.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.291
Well, you think I wake up
looking like this?

00:24.375 --> 00:25.458
It takes time.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.959
They want ratings,
I'm giving 'em ratings.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.500
You still eating
those damn Tums?

00:29.583 --> 00:31.417
(Kravet)
'Only thing keeping me
alive.'

00:34.208 --> 00:35.333
Okay, Jane.

00:35.417 --> 00:38.250
You've got the SNL
thing
and the rerun thing.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.583
Move to your left, Jane.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.917
- How's this, Clay?
- Camera loves you.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.333
Have you talked to them yet?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.625
Come on, Nathan.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.166
Barbara Wa-Wa
isn't the only one

00:48.250 --> 00:49.458
who can make
celebrities cry.

00:49.542 --> 00:50.750
Get me a special.

00:50.834 --> 00:52.458
You won't remember
my name when you sign

00:52.542 --> 00:54.625
that big contract
with network, will you?

00:54.709 --> 00:55.792
The adorable man
who rescued me

00:55.875 --> 00:57.583
from tiny-town
action news?

00:57.667 --> 00:59.333
- 'You kidding?'
- 'Two.'

00:59.417 --> 01:01.542
- I'll talk to them.
- 'One.'

01:01.625 --> 01:03.709
A fire in a
West Philadelphia row house

01:03.792 --> 01:05.041
claims six lives.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.500
The Channel 7 News Team
is on the ground

01:06.583 --> 01:08.291
with that story
in just a moment.

01:08.375 --> 01:11.375
(Jane)
'And later we'll
you the..'

01:11.458 --> 01:13.291
- Oh.
- What?

01:16.083 --> 01:17.542
- We lost the teleprompter.
- Where is it?

01:17.625 --> 01:20.959
Um, the update on the..

01:21.041 --> 01:23.792
- Cut to commercial?
- Give her a second.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.000
The story on
the Bass Group's

01:28.083 --> 01:29.500
'two billion dollar purchase'

01:29.583 --> 01:31.083
'of the Savings
and Loan Association.'

01:31.166 --> 01:32.542
No, hang on.
Slow it down. Wait, wait.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.458
(Jane)
'But first, what you've
been waiting for.'

01:34.542 --> 01:37.000
After months of reruns
due to the writer's strike

01:37.083 --> 01:38.834
Falcon Crest,
Murder She Wrote

01:38.917 --> 01:40.375
and all your
favorites are back.

01:40.458 --> 01:43.208
The update
after these messages.

01:45.458 --> 01:46.834
All clear.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.166
You get 'em, Jane.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.041
- Okay.
- This ain't casual Friday.

02:23.125 --> 02:25.542
What, are you trying out
for the team mascot, Nick?

02:25.625 --> 02:26.709
Game's tonight.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.083
You in, Scotty?
Hitting Jones.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.375
I don't do hockey.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.500
I wanna see a fight
I go to the ring.

02:31.583 --> 02:32.709
Oh, man.
This one's
something.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.917
Anyone remember a newscaster
named Jane Everett

02:37.000 --> 02:38.750
co-anchor at Channel 7?

02:38.834 --> 02:40.625
Jane Everett.
She was hot.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.959
Yeah, strangled in
Fairmount Park back in the
'80s.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.250
A research assistant from
Channel 7 is on her way up

02:45.333 --> 02:47.542
to show us something.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.083
- Ooh.
- Was that a tooth?

02:49.166 --> 02:51.542
- 'Gloves are off, baby.'
- 'Hmm-mm.'

02:52.208 --> 02:54.083
Tory Roberts?

02:54.166 --> 02:56.542
- Channel 7.
- I'm Detective Rush.

02:56.625 --> 02:59.291
Why don't you
come with me?

03:00.542 --> 03:03.041
Oh...I got it.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.583
Make sure you get
all her info, you know..

03:07.667 --> 03:11.250
name, number,
marital status.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.500
Uh, said you had
something to show us?

03:15.583 --> 03:17.792
An old Beta tape.

03:17.875 --> 03:20.792
We're converting
outdated formats to DVD.

03:20.875 --> 03:23.000
I got stuck logging
all the footage.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.375
You'd give WCNU reporters

03:24.458 --> 03:27.709
a run for their
money,
they put you on the
air.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.250
- Gonna make that jump one day.
- Yeah?

03:31.959 --> 03:33.250
So what do you got?

03:35.417 --> 03:37.917
This is Jane Everett of WCNU.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.792
Tonight I'll be bringing
you a special report.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.583
Jane Everett.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.458
What?

03:46.542 --> 03:48.959
Slow down.

03:49.041 --> 03:51.000
'Are you threatening me?'

03:51.083 --> 03:53.625
'Listen, just..
You did the right thing.'

03:53.709 --> 03:56.750
Just don't make
any decisions tonight.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.375
Tell me where you are.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.125
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

04:01.208 --> 04:05.125
- Tape's got a time stamp.
- '"November 2, 1988."'

04:05.208 --> 04:06.834
Everyone said her murder
was this random thing

04:06.917 --> 04:10.208
but they found the body,
six hours after that call.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.834
11:46 P.M.

04:12.917 --> 04:15.041
Means Jane met her
caller around midnight.

04:15.125 --> 04:18.041
So the caller's either
the last to see..

04:18.125 --> 04:20.834
Or Jane's talking
to her killer.

04:56.792 --> 04:59.583
"Local cross-country team
finds
newscaster Jane Everett

04:59.667 --> 05:02.166
strangled in Fairmount Park."

05:02.250 --> 05:04.375
No shortage of coverage
or man-hours on this one.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.875
Story was all over the place.
People felt like they knew
her.

05:06.959 --> 05:09.041
Well, she was in their
living rooms every night.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.166
(Vera)
'Hmm. Pretty girl.'

05:11.250 --> 05:12.959
Looked great in a leotard.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.959
Did you see that special
she did on aerobics?

05:15.041 --> 05:16.250
You into aerobics, Nick?

05:16.333 --> 05:18.083
What's it to you?

05:18.166 --> 05:20.834
Don't let me catch
you in a leotard.

05:20.917 --> 05:23.583
Well, Jane grew up in Manayunk.
Uh, tough neighborhood.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.583
Father was a tollbooth
operator,
died in '82.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.917
- Mom was a housewife.
- Margie Everett.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.667
Valens and Miller
are talking to her now.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.333
Only 27 years old.

05:32.417 --> 05:34.709
Strangled with
her
own scarf.

05:34.792 --> 05:35.792
Crime of passion.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.333
No mention of a boyfriend.

05:37.417 --> 05:39.000
Ah, original theory
was some perv

05:39.083 --> 05:40.083
saw an easy target.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.625
(Rush)
'No DNA or witnesses'

05:41.709 --> 05:42.750
to discount the theory.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.291
Abrasions, torn clothes.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.875
She didn't go without a fight.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.500
(Stillman)
'Lived a few blocks
from the park.'

05:48.583 --> 05:49.583
Jogged there every morning

05:49.667 --> 05:50.750
at 5:00 A.M. before work.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.000
"5:00 A.M." hours
are worse than
ours.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.417
Uh, she died
in the same clothes

05:54.500 --> 05:56.083
she was wearing in that video.

05:56.166 --> 05:57.917
Turtleneck, windbreaker.

05:58.000 --> 05:58.917
Time of death was estimated

05:59.000 --> 06:00.750
between 2:00 and 6:00 A.M.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.417
Maybe she didn't go
to the park for her run.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.709
Could've met
the caller there.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.875
Or the caller
knew
she'd be there.

06:05.959 --> 06:07.542
Tracked her down.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.500
See what you can get
from WCNU phone records.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.917
If Jane knew her attacker,
it's about time we did, too.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.875
My daughter was a natural.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.625
One look at her,
people just fell in love.

06:19.709 --> 06:21.250
Anything you can
tell us about her

06:21.333 --> 06:22.959
personal life,
Mrs. Everett?

06:23.041 --> 06:24.875
Yeah, she didn't have one.

06:24.959 --> 06:26.959
She spent years
at stations out
west.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.917
Then she gets
a job here in
Philly

06:29.000 --> 06:30.291
I still didn't
get to see her.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.458
Oh, attractive woman like Jane

06:32.542 --> 06:34.125
must had a boyfriend.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.959
Well, if she did,
she didn't tell me
about it.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.583
Two of you..

06:37.667 --> 06:38.792
...have a falling out?

06:38.875 --> 06:40.166
I left college in the middle

06:40.250 --> 06:42.709
of my junior year to have her.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.291
I got my education
from the school

06:44.375 --> 06:47.625
of Edward R. Murrow
and Walter Cronkite.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.834
Janey and I, uh..

06:49.917 --> 06:52.750
We bonded over the news
when she was a little girl.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.166
'She'd even give her own
broadcasts at dinner.'

06:55.250 --> 06:57.792
But by the time
she died, the news

06:57.875 --> 06:59.041
wasn't the news anymore.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.166
It's nothing but fluff.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.083
'She didn't seem to care.'

07:02.166 --> 07:05.041
"Aerobics,
celebrity love lives."

07:06.333 --> 07:07.542
That what your spat was over?

07:07.625 --> 07:10.417
Type of stories
she was covering?

07:10.500 --> 07:14.166
She was co-anchoring the fourth
largest market in this country.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.083
It still wasn't
enough for me.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.000
Janey, you're on.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.583
(Jane on TV)
...participating in
this great event.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.166
Oh, what are you wearing?

07:23.250 --> 07:26.375
- Um, it's a Halloween
costume.
- Uh.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.500
I gotta say, I think
the adults are having

07:28.583 --> 07:29.500
as much fun as the kids.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.959
It's better than the sexy witch.

07:31.041 --> 07:33.542
'And best of all,
the proceeds go to charity.'

07:33.625 --> 07:36.667
Shaw Plastics raised $50,000
for disadvantaged kids.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.333
'So, it was a good cause.'

07:38.417 --> 07:39.959
(Margie)
'More like
a good advertisement.'

07:40.041 --> 07:42.083
Did Shaw Plastics pay you
to cover that story?

07:42.166 --> 07:43.875
We do this kind of stuff
all the time, ma.

07:43.959 --> 07:47.125
You give companies
positive press, they buy ads.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.625
Well, the Jane I knew
dreamed of covering

07:49.709 --> 07:51.250
the presidential debates.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.083
Mort is covering
the presidential debates.

07:53.166 --> 07:54.625
You know that.

07:54.709 --> 07:56.250
Can't you cover them, too?

07:56.333 --> 07:59.625
Why do you always get
stuck with the fluff?

07:59.709 --> 08:00.834
There's gotta be
something else.

08:00.917 --> 08:02.500
Like what?
The elections in Chile?

08:02.583 --> 08:05.041
Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan?

08:05.125 --> 08:07.375
Do you know what it would take
to get people to watch a story

08:07.458 --> 08:09.417
about armed rebels
in remote villages?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.542
Well, you don't really
believe that, do you?

08:11.625 --> 08:14.375
Management made changes
to improve our ratings.

08:14.458 --> 08:17.000
I took their advice
about my hair and my wardrobe

08:17.083 --> 08:18.375
and we went up four points.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.750
Four points
for teasing your hair?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.083
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you this, ma.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.417
It's just...it's the way
the business is now.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.959
I just..
I don't understand

08:28.041 --> 08:29.750
why news had to
stop being news.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.667
Well, ask Nathan
if you don't believe me.

08:31.750 --> 08:34.083
We've made peace with it.
Maybe you should, too.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.583
Janey, I'm not trying
to be critical.

08:35.667 --> 08:36.917
I know. I've got
an early morning, ma.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.834
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Well..

08:47.834 --> 08:51.083
The last time
I saw my daughter alive

08:51.166 --> 08:52.834
I was giving her
a hard time.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.667
Now who's this Nathan

08:55.750 --> 08:56.750
she was talking about?

08:56.834 --> 08:59.625
Nathan Kravet.
He was her boss.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.750
Well, he was her
mentor, really.

09:01.834 --> 09:05.125
They met when Janey was
at Syracuse University.

09:05.208 --> 09:07.333
Thanks for your time,
Mrs. Everett.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.834
What I wouldn't give
to see Janey on TV again

09:10.917 --> 09:12.208
cat suit or not.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.291
Everett was
something
else.

09:19.375 --> 09:22.500
I gave a guest lecture
at Syracuse her freshman year.

09:22.583 --> 09:26.250
She sent me a story idea
every week till she
graduated.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.875
- They any good?
- Not bad, actually.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.458
She had an eye
for the angle.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.458
Could find a
story
in any picture.

09:32.542 --> 09:34.041
Where'd the
cat suit fit in?

09:34.125 --> 09:36.625
By the time
I hired her at
WCNU

09:36.709 --> 09:37.875
things were changing.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.125
What qualified as news

09:39.208 --> 09:41.333
was anything
that got
ratings.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.291
Including cute newsgirls?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.667
Before Reagan took office

09:44.750 --> 09:46.458
stations had
to serve the
public

09:46.542 --> 09:48.041
present balanced reports.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.500
Hell, there were even
limits on the amount of
ads.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.834
Reagan relaxed
all the rules.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.291
(Jeffries)
'Relaxed is right.'

09:55.375 --> 09:57.500
'Looks more like
a vacation than reporting.'

09:57.583 --> 09:58.667
Company retreats.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.208
Better ratings
meant
better profits.

10:00.291 --> 10:03.083
Better profits meant
better corporate
retreats.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.208
Any idea who might have been

10:04.291 --> 10:05.834
threatening Jane,
the night she died?

10:05.917 --> 10:08.834
No idea. It wasn't like
she was breaking
Watergate.

10:08.917 --> 10:12.000
Uh, I think her last
story
was about mall
walkers.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.458
You see her that night?

10:13.542 --> 10:15.333
I was holed up in my
office
on the third floor.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.375
Jane was on
the first, so
no.

10:17.458 --> 10:18.625
Did she always
work till midnight?

10:18.709 --> 10:20.667
Evening news
wrapped at 7:00

10:20.750 --> 10:21.667
doesn't mean we did.

10:21.750 --> 10:22.917
Public persona like that

10:23.000 --> 10:25.250
she ever attract
the wrong kind of attention?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.667
Far as I knew,
everyone loved
her.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.083
After a year at WCNU

10:29.166 --> 10:30.583
she was getting more fan mail

10:30.667 --> 10:31.792
than the seasoned reporters.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.208
Any of those
seasoned reporters

10:33.291 --> 10:35.083
have a problem
with that?

10:35.166 --> 10:37.542
There's one person
who comes to mind.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.875
(male #2)
'The crime has left
two people dead'

10:40.959 --> 10:42.709
'and an entire
neighborhood devastated.'

10:42.792 --> 10:44.166
It's yet another casualty

10:44.250 --> 10:47.542
of the crack epidemic
here in the Philly..

10:47.625 --> 10:50.250
In-in the city of..

10:50.333 --> 10:53.917
In other news, he's this
year's Sexiest Man Alive.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.166
JFK, Junior.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.041
So who made his list
of sexiest women?

10:57.125 --> 10:59.208
We'll have
the story after
this.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.458
(male #1)
'All clear.'

11:00.542 --> 11:02.667
The last I checked,
I was the lead anchor.

11:02.750 --> 11:03.875
I was trying to help you.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.208
Let me finish
the damn story.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.959
It's called a transition
or don't they teach that

11:07.041 --> 11:08.625
in journalism school anymore?

11:08.709 --> 11:11.458
Take it easy, Mort.
She's doing her job.

11:11.542 --> 11:13.750
You're the one who hired this
amateur bubblehead newsreader.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.250
As opposed to a
pompous has-been?

11:15.333 --> 11:16.500
Hey, I was here
before you, sweetie.

11:16.583 --> 11:17.750
I'll be here after.

11:17.834 --> 11:19.750
(male #1)
'Nine, eight, seven..'

11:19.834 --> 11:21.750
Have you checked
with management on that?

11:21.834 --> 11:24.083
You bet against me, sweetheart
and I'll crush you.

11:24.166 --> 11:27.709
(male #1)
'Three, two, one.'

11:27.792 --> 11:29.750
An update on a story
from yesterday.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.125
The President has stated
that his position

11:31.208 --> 11:32.583
will not change in spite of

11:32.667 --> 11:34.542
what Congress
has proposed..'

11:36.667 --> 11:39.083
WCNU went from worst
to first that year

11:39.166 --> 11:41.208
and there was
only one
reason

11:41.291 --> 11:42.458
Jane Everett.

11:42.542 --> 11:43.625
Mort knew it?

11:43.709 --> 11:44.959
His low-grade insecurity

11:45.041 --> 11:46.792
became full-blown paranoia.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.083
Called me all
hours
of the night

11:48.166 --> 11:49.208
trying to
get
her fired.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.625
Why not get rid
of him instead?

11:50.709 --> 11:52.458
Thought about it.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.166
Till he won a
Peabody
for his coverage

11:54.250 --> 11:55.792
of Jane's murder.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.083
Bought himself another
20 years in the
business.

12:00.625 --> 12:04.458
So I get this Bobby
Badass
in the squad car.

12:04.542 --> 12:07.583
Thinks I'm hauling him
down
to PPD till he realizes

12:07.667 --> 12:08.834
we're heading in
the wrong
direction.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.583
The kid starts
freaking out
'cause

12:10.667 --> 12:12.500
we're going into
29th Street
territory.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.792
- The rival gang?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.500
He's begging us
to turn around

12:15.583 --> 12:17.625
and I'm talking to my partner
about stopping for doughnuts.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.917
Kid wets his pants,
tells us everything.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.750
Oh, that'd make
a great segment.

12:22.834 --> 12:26.291
Hmm, well, there's
more
where that came from.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.917
How are things going?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.417
Jane Everett case?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.000
Stick around..

12:32.083 --> 12:33.834
...and I'll let you know.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.667
Scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours?

12:35.750 --> 12:37.000
Sounds good to me.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.750
- Hey, take that off, would
ya?
- What?

12:43.834 --> 12:46.333
Looks like you're
about to take flight.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.583
(Vera)
'Check out Casanova with
that hottie from Channel 7.'

12:49.667 --> 12:51.041
Back in the saddle.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.208
Excuse me.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.000
What up, fellas?

12:57.083 --> 12:59.250
Rush dug up some dirt
on Mort Ackerson.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.166
Jane lodged a formal
complaint against him

13:01.250 --> 13:03.500
with the
WCNU Human Resources

13:03.583 --> 13:04.750
October 18, '88.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.458
That's two weeks
before she's
killed.

13:06.542 --> 13:09.125
It said Mort showed
up at her shoots

13:09.208 --> 13:11.709
was following her to
interviews
and press conferences.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.959
Yeah, Tory says
the guy's a real
tool.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.000
Got serious issues
working with the
ladies.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.500
(female #1)
'Hey!'

13:19.625 --> 13:21.125
'Eat it, Zaretsky!'

13:31.875 --> 13:33.542
That's gonna be
better than the
game.

13:36.834 --> 13:39.208
Well, last I checked,
this was a cop bar.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.834
Is that the best you can
do?
Newsroom Barbie?

13:41.917 --> 13:45.500
- Oh, damn it, Frankie.
- What? I like hockey.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.625
Your husband
like hockey too?

13:49.875 --> 13:51.041
Admit it.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.208
What?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.709
You're trying
to make me
jealous.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.250
You're the one came here.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.417
So, maybe it's working.

14:01.125 --> 14:05.375
You know, you're not
the only woman in the world.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.208
Right now I am.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.542
I should go.

14:21.625 --> 14:23.417
Yeah, you should.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.083
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.458
Mr. Ackerson?

14:48.542 --> 14:49.625
I'm Detective Rush.

14:49.709 --> 14:51.625
'I don't normally
do this but'

14:51.709 --> 14:53.500
you think I could
have your autograph?

14:53.583 --> 14:55.709
[chuckles]
Oh, sure.

14:56.667 --> 14:57.875
Call me Mort.

14:59.959 --> 15:01.250
It's for my auntie.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.792
Sign it "Dear Edie

15:05.792 --> 15:07.125
see you in
50
to life."

15:11.291 --> 15:13.709
You think I hurt
Jane Everett?

15:13.792 --> 15:15.250
Is-Is that what
this is all about?

15:15.333 --> 15:16.875
Convince me otherwise.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.166
I always thought it was
innocent until proven guilty.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.542
Remember what happened
to your ratings

15:20.625 --> 15:22.667
after Jane was murdered, Mort?

15:23.667 --> 15:25.625
I didn't pay
attention to ratings.

15:25.709 --> 15:26.875
They went up.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.000
Or maybe it's 'cause of

15:28.083 --> 15:29.000
the Peabody Award I won?

15:29.083 --> 15:30.834
For covering Jane's murder.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.458
You ever show up
at her shoots?

15:33.542 --> 15:36.500
- No.
- 'Call her at home?'

15:36.583 --> 15:38.000
No.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.667
Oh, Jane's
Human Resources
file.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.417
But I guess you already
know about the complaint

15:41.500 --> 15:42.792
she filed against you.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.125
So I wasn't
her biggest fan.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.917
But that girl
didn't know her place.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.583
(Mort)
'That's the Shaw Plastics
fundraiser, isn't it?'

15:54.667 --> 15:58.750
- Who's that fighting?
- David Wyatt.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.792
(Mort)
'He's their PR guy,
isn't he?'

16:00.875 --> 16:02.041
(Jane)
'Doesn't make sense.'

16:02.125 --> 16:04.041
They take care
of their employees.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.208
Tell it to that guy.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.083
(male #3 on TV)
'Excuse me.
Terribly sorry.'

16:18.083 --> 16:19.917
Mandatory drug testing?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.417
'Don't you think
I know what that's about?'

16:21.500 --> 16:23.875
My family has given
15 years to this
plant.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.250
Would you keep
your voice down?

16:25.333 --> 16:26.875
Hey, look, I just want
some answers, alright?

16:26.959 --> 16:28.875
We both know I'm entitled
to hell of a lot more than
that.

16:28.959 --> 16:30.792
Something's going on here.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.041
So, what do you think you're
some kind of breaking news

16:34.125 --> 16:35.375
reporter all of a sudden?

16:35.458 --> 16:36.792
Why don't you go
bother that new intern

16:36.875 --> 16:38.542
you've been circling, huh?

16:38.625 --> 16:40.458
Piece of advice,
sweetheart?

16:40.542 --> 16:41.709
Stick to putting on
your lipstick

16:41.792 --> 16:43.333
and smiling pretty
for the camera.

16:43.417 --> 16:46.333
And upstage you?
Never.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.208
(Rush)
'She was investigating
a story.'

16:53.333 --> 16:55.583
I was worrying
about that myself.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.417
But if there
was a story there

16:57.500 --> 16:59.834
Jane wasn't getting it.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.417
(male #4)
'Who the hell are you?'

17:24.917 --> 17:26.458
She reported me to

17:26.542 --> 17:28.917
Human Resources
the next morning.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.959
She was just mad 'cause
she didn't have what it took.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.500
I was the one people trusted.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.166
Where was
that house
located?

17:37.208 --> 17:40.500
Corner of
4th and...Lehigh?

17:40.583 --> 17:43.417
Where were you
the night Jane
died?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.625
I caught up
with that new intern.

17:45.709 --> 17:46.709
Rhonda Stewart.

17:46.792 --> 17:47.959
Gonna need her number.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.792
No problem.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.083
I'm sure she'll remember.

17:52.166 --> 17:55.000
Boss, got the phone
records from WCNU.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.959
Call to Jane's extension
at 11:46 was local.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.125
So there was no way
to trace it back that far.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.625
What about her
reporter's
notebook?

18:01.709 --> 18:04.417
Station cleaned out
her office back when.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.333
Mort Ackerson's
alibi check out?

18:06.417 --> 18:08.166
Uh, Rhonda the intern.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.709
Big producer
over at WIXA now.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.000
Uh, she vouched for him.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.667
Mort's lucky day.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.667
Canvassed the block
of 4th and Lehigh.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.667
Guy who lived in the
corner house moved in '89.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.625
Uh, name's Evan Briggs.

18:20.709 --> 18:23.667
Neighbor said he worked at
Shaw Plastics with his wife.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.125
Left the neighborhood
after she died.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.542
Where is he now?

18:26.625 --> 18:29.208
Meijer's Plastics
bought Shaw off, December
'88.

18:29.291 --> 18:31.667
Lot of red tape getting
to his personnel file.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.667
See if ADA Bell can help
with the warrant.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.458
Sounds like this Briggs
had real issues with Jane.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.625
Hey.

18:43.417 --> 18:44.917
Oh, hi.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.709
I, uh..

18:48.792 --> 18:51.000
...think you got
something of
mine.

18:51.917 --> 18:54.166
Something of yours?

18:54.250 --> 18:55.750
Are you sure?

18:55.834 --> 18:58.125
I'm sure.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.375
Let me, uh, see
what I can dig
up.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.500
Yeah, you do that.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.417
Detectives.
I'm Andrew Powers, CEO.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.417
I was hoping to join
your meeting, but, uh

19:18.500 --> 19:21.333
I'm sure David can help
you
with whatever you need.

19:21.417 --> 19:23.667
I'm David Wyatt.
Public Relations.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.625
I understand you have
some questions concerning

19:25.709 --> 19:27.250
a former employee,
Evan Briggs?

19:27.333 --> 19:30.583
Two of you had some kind
of altercation back in '88?

19:30.667 --> 19:31.917
That was a long time ago.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.083
In fact, it
didn't
ring any bells

19:33.166 --> 19:34.458
until I pulled the file.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.709
I'd only been with
the company a few months.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.041
What does this have to do

19:38.125 --> 19:39.542
with Jane Everett's murder?

19:39.625 --> 19:41.667
Can I see that file?

19:41.750 --> 19:42.917
Yes.

19:45.542 --> 19:49.375
He was terminated for failing
to pass a mandatory drug test.

19:49.458 --> 19:52.250
I don't see any
prior infractions

19:52.333 --> 19:54.208
previous 21 years?

19:54.291 --> 19:56.917
Well, we didn't start
the testing until '88.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.166
He could've been coming
to work high every day.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.208
We would never have known.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.125
Meijers bought Shaw Plastics

20:02.208 --> 20:03.750
later on that year, right?

20:03.834 --> 20:06.083
Drug testing, a precursor
to the buyout?

20:06.166 --> 20:07.583
Did make sense, I mean..

20:07.667 --> 20:10.333
...you'd wanna get rid
of the deadbeats first.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.208
Well, drill it
down,
and yes

20:12.291 --> 20:14.792
a guy like Evan Briggs
was bad for business.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.667
Shaw Plastics is
a family
corporation.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.792
No room for drug use.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.208
Family corporation?

20:20.291 --> 20:21.625
It's a funny way
of putting it.

20:21.709 --> 20:24.375
Sometimes we had to use
a little tough love.

20:24.458 --> 20:28.333
Jane Everett ever contact you
about this "Tough love"
program?

20:28.417 --> 20:29.959
Uh, no.

20:30.041 --> 20:32.125
Well, she ever talk
to you about Briggs?

20:32.208 --> 20:35.834
Ms. Everett covered
a few fundraisers for
us.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.542
That's all.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.750
Now, if you will
excuse me, um..

20:41.834 --> 20:44.125
I do have some
business
I need to attend to.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.959
Thanks for your time.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.333
Oh, we're holding on to this.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.458
"Drill it down."
Guy's a schmuck.

20:57.542 --> 20:58.959
Hey, I gotta swing
by Channel 7.

20:59.041 --> 21:00.834
See if they got more
Jane Everett tapes.

21:00.917 --> 21:02.834
You wanna come with?
Hit Geno's after?

21:02.917 --> 21:04.125
Oh, you mean

21:04.208 --> 21:06.291
'cause you don't wanna
go to Channel 7 alone

21:06.375 --> 21:08.291
after you ditched that
girl
at the bar last night?

21:08.375 --> 21:09.542
What are you talking about?

21:09.625 --> 21:11.959
Leave me out of
it.
Uh-uh.

21:12.959 --> 21:15.166
'Nope! Uh-uh.'

21:28.834 --> 21:30.166
Look who's back.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.542
Yeah.
Tory, listen. Uh..

21:32.625 --> 21:35.542
On-the-line guys needed help
with a bust over in Fishtown.

21:35.625 --> 21:36.875
I wanted to tell you but

21:36.959 --> 21:38.625
this kind of thing
goes down quick and..

21:38.709 --> 21:42.166
Your on-the-line guys
always wear pencil
skirts?

21:43.417 --> 21:44.875
Yeah, right.

21:44.959 --> 21:46.458
Well, actually, that girl

21:46.542 --> 21:49.834
she's an associate
of the undercover unit.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.041
Hmm, you-you know what?

21:51.125 --> 21:54.041
Next time
something
"Goes down"

21:54.125 --> 21:56.250
I get a call
for the
exclusive.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.709
Deal.

22:00.583 --> 22:03.250
Oh, so, where do
you wanna start?

22:03.333 --> 22:04.291
Are these the tapes?

22:04.375 --> 22:06.000
Every tape Jane ever made.

22:09.959 --> 22:12.041
(Vera)
'So, you were
Jane's cameraman?'

22:12.125 --> 22:14.083
I knew Jane
better
than anyone.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.041
Best angle, best lights.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.709
- Sounds intimate.
- 'Nature of the job.'

22:18.792 --> 22:20.959
You two ever get involved?

22:21.041 --> 22:22.333
Wouldn't have minded.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.125
But she was busy
climbing the ladder.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.667
She ever mention
a story involving

22:25.750 --> 22:28.083
a plastics factory,
Shaw Plastics?

22:28.166 --> 22:31.291
We covered a fundraiser
for them once.

22:31.375 --> 22:32.709
Jane saw something.

22:32.792 --> 22:34.208
She had me film
a couple of guys

22:34.291 --> 22:37.208
arguing while she pretended
to talk to fans.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.834
Was this man one of them?

22:40.583 --> 22:44.375
Yeah, he was arguing with a
guy.
Looked like his boss, maybe.

22:44.458 --> 22:47.041
Ever see him giving
Jane any trouble?

22:47.125 --> 22:48.583
Yeah. A couple
of nights later

22:48.667 --> 22:51.792
we were shooting B-roll
at an aerobics class.

22:51.875 --> 22:53.667
She wanted to go by his house.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.792
But he definitely
wasn't expecting us.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.792
Mr. Briggs, are you home?

23:25.875 --> 23:27.834
Hey! What the hell
are you doing back here again?

23:27.917 --> 23:29.458
Oh, Mr. Briggs,
the door was open.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.750
- I thought you heard us.
- I already told you.

23:30.834 --> 23:31.875
I got nothing to say.

23:31.959 --> 23:33.208
Now that drug
test
was a lie.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.959
Now, get out of here,
before I call the cops!

23:35.041 --> 23:37.542
Please, I just wanna talk
to you, help figure things
out.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.709
Maybe that is what the test
picked up. Percocet?

23:39.792 --> 23:41.041
You get out of
here
with that thing!

23:41.125 --> 23:43.041
- Easy, buddy!
- Wait outside, Clay.

23:43.125 --> 23:46.917
I have done some research
and I think I can help you.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.917
Look, I ain't gonna
ask you again.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.125
Now, get out.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I don't know what
that story was about

23:59.083 --> 24:00.917
but whatever it was
pissed that guy off.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.875
You didn't think that
might've
caused Jane's murder?

24:03.959 --> 24:06.458
Hotheads like him
made good TV.

24:06.542 --> 24:09.166
Way reporters
earned their stripes.

24:13.417 --> 24:15.125
What the hell is all this?

24:27.000 --> 24:30.166
Evan Briggs?
Philadelphia Homicide.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.709
Like to ask you
a few questions.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.291
What kind of questions?

24:36.375 --> 24:37.667
Kind about Jane Everett.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.709
Got nothing to say.

24:40.792 --> 24:41.875
Well, talk to us for an hour

24:41.959 --> 24:43.583
or talk to
a grand jury for
six?

24:43.667 --> 24:45.667
Your choice.

24:48.458 --> 24:50.875
Briggs? Briggs?

24:50.959 --> 24:52.667
[dog barking]
Run!

25:00.417 --> 25:01.750
Hey, don't hurt him,
you hear?

25:01.834 --> 25:02.959
Control the dog
or the next one

25:03.041 --> 25:04.458
has his name on it!

25:13.792 --> 25:16.125
Saw your brand
of hospitality, Briggs.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.083
Jane Everett come at you,
one too many times

25:18.166 --> 25:19.250
get the same treatment?

25:19.333 --> 25:21.166
I didn't hurt that reporter.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.875
You were in a hell
of a situation back in '88.

25:23.959 --> 25:25.917
Lost your job, your wife.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.208
Your life was
in a tailspin.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.000
Jane found out,
you got
terminated

25:29.083 --> 25:30.417
threatened to make
your life even
worse

25:30.500 --> 25:32.917
by exposing
your drug
use.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.041
Couldn't get worse.

25:34.125 --> 25:36.083
Not when they took
my health
insurance.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.375
Not when they took my house.

25:37.458 --> 25:38.917
Had to sting.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.166
Jane throwing you under a bus

25:40.250 --> 25:41.417
just to break a story.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.750
Don't you get it?

25:42.834 --> 25:45.667
Story wasn't about me.
It was about my wife.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.583
We-we worked
at the factory
together

25:51.667 --> 25:53.458
till she got cancer.

25:53.542 --> 25:55.542
Jane knew
who was to blame

25:55.625 --> 25:57.166
for her getting sick.

26:15.625 --> 26:17.333
Oh! Mr. Briggs.

26:18.792 --> 26:21.125
You scared me.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.500
She's gone.
My wife.

26:29.709 --> 26:31.750
You know, doctors said
it was coming, but..

26:33.917 --> 26:35.250
You don't wanna believe.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.542
I'm sorry.

26:39.625 --> 26:43.000
Uh, what you were
talking about?

26:43.083 --> 26:44.375
I'm listening.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.917
I spoke to the pharmacist
you go to about the
Percocet

26:49.000 --> 26:51.417
you're taking
for your
cough.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.667
She said you're
not
the only one

26:52.750 --> 26:55.000
from the
factory
taking it.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.417
So?

26:56.500 --> 26:57.709
I met with a doctor.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.500
Told him the tubing
that Shaw manufactures

26:59.583 --> 27:01.250
is reinforced with asbestos.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.166
He said the tests are
just being confirmed

27:03.250 --> 27:06.667
but a lot of people are
saying that asbestos is
bad.

27:11.125 --> 27:14.375
Said it's probably what
caused your wife's
cancer.

27:19.709 --> 27:21.166
They knew?

27:23.417 --> 27:25.959
There are others.

27:26.041 --> 27:29.125
Doctor gave Peggy Foster
four months this morning.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.709
She's even younger
than my wife.

27:33.792 --> 27:36.250
Cliff
Schuster.
Len Turner--

27:36.333 --> 27:38.959
Alright, uh, what
do you wanna do?

27:42.750 --> 27:45.000
I wanna take them on.

27:45.083 --> 27:47.250
Take on Shaw Plastics?
Yeah.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.375
Anyone opens their mouth

27:48.458 --> 27:50.250
company will cut 'em
off at the ankles.

27:50.333 --> 27:51.458
They'll take their
health insurance.

27:51.542 --> 27:52.583
That's all those
people got.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.375
You do
nothing,
the company

27:54.458 --> 27:55.458
gets away with murder.

27:55.542 --> 27:57.417
Hey, my word ain't
gonna mean squat

27:57.500 --> 27:59.250
against those suits.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.542
That's why I found
someone to back us up.

28:01.625 --> 28:04.583
- An insider.
- Someone from Shaw?

28:04.667 --> 28:05.709
He agreed to go on camera

28:05.792 --> 28:07.250
admit that Shaw
knew their employees

28:07.333 --> 28:09.625
were being exposed to
asbestos and covered it
up.

28:09.709 --> 28:11.875
- I'm gonna film him tonight.
- Then what?

28:11.959 --> 28:13.375
Then I bring
it
to my boss

28:13.458 --> 28:14.834
and we break
the story
tomorrow.

28:14.917 --> 28:15.917
Prime time.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.583
Wait, your boss
knows about this?

28:17.667 --> 28:20.083
We're gonna tell him
tonight.
He-he'll stand by us.

28:23.834 --> 28:25.875
- Ms. Everett, uh..
- Jane.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.500
These, uh, men

28:32.583 --> 28:35.500
they play dirty,
and they ain't gonna stop at
me.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.709
So why are you doing this?

28:40.667 --> 28:43.750
What kind of a reporter
would I be if I didn't?

28:48.375 --> 28:51.458
She ever tell you
who this insider was?

28:51.542 --> 28:52.709
No idea.

28:52.792 --> 28:55.625
Guys in management
were cronies.

28:55.709 --> 28:57.667
Can't imagine
any one of them

28:57.750 --> 28:59.250
sticking a neck out.

28:59.333 --> 29:01.208
The morning Jane died

29:01.291 --> 29:02.250
where were you?

29:02.333 --> 29:04.917
Cleaning toilets
in Center City.

29:06.417 --> 29:09.000
Worked the midnight
shift
at the Atco Building

29:09.083 --> 29:10.834
after the factory canned me.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
At least until I got sick.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.041
You, too?

29:23.083 --> 29:25.792
Been in remission twice.

29:25.875 --> 29:28.041
Don't think
there'll be a
third.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.083
When my wife got diagnosed

29:31.166 --> 29:32.750
would've given
anything to be

29:32.834 --> 29:35.000
the one going through it.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.750
Guess my prayers
have been answered.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.041
"You did the right thing.

29:48.125 --> 29:51.166
Don't make any
decisions tonight."

29:51.250 --> 29:53.834
Gotta be this insider
who called her that night.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.208
Well, Jane wanted
to broadcast

29:55.291 --> 29:56.625
the interview the next day.

29:56.709 --> 30:00.458
Guy was trying to undo
what he'd already done.

30:00.542 --> 30:03.208
So if Jane recorded
the interview, where's the
tape?

30:03.291 --> 30:05.542
Well, it definitely
ain't at WCNU.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.333
I screened every
tape
Jane ever touched.

30:07.417 --> 30:08.875
(Rush)
'Could've brought it
home with her.'

30:08.959 --> 30:11.208
That's what
I would've
done.

30:11.291 --> 30:12.792
Who packed up Jane's house?

30:17.000 --> 30:20.208
Here are the rest of them.
Been in there for years.

30:20.291 --> 30:22.875
Just couldn't bring myself
to throw anything away.

30:24.041 --> 30:25.750
Did Jane ever tell
you about the last story

30:25.834 --> 30:27.208
she was working on?

30:27.291 --> 30:29.417
Was, um, something
about people

30:29.500 --> 30:31.625
walking in malls
for exercise, wasn't it?

30:31.709 --> 30:33.166
Lil, I got something.

30:34.625 --> 30:37.458
"November 2, 1988."

30:38.500 --> 30:39.959
A day before she died.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.959
People deserve to know
the truth about

30:42.041 --> 30:43.917
what's happening to them.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.750
Why it's happening.
People are dying.

30:46.834 --> 30:48.458
(Jane)
'The people you're
referring to are'

30:48.542 --> 30:50.667
'employees of Shaw Plastics?'

30:50.750 --> 30:51.959
(male #5 on TV)
'Factory workers.'

30:52.041 --> 30:54.333
They're being exposed
to a dangerous toxin

30:54.417 --> 30:55.875
called asbestos.

30:55.959 --> 30:57.041
How do you know this?

30:57.125 --> 30:59.000
Because I have the memo.

31:00.417 --> 31:03.166
Shaw Plastics was aware
of the effects of asbestos.

31:03.250 --> 31:06.417
(Jane)
'Can you explain what
that means exactly?'

31:06.500 --> 31:09.250
(male #5 on TV)
'Well, if-if you drill it
down'

31:09.333 --> 31:12.834
it means the company knew
asbestos was causing cancer.

31:14.208 --> 31:18.166
And instead of doing
anything about it

31:18.250 --> 31:19.500
'they covered it up.'

31:21.959 --> 31:23.291
Exactly?

31:23.375 --> 31:26.250
Well, if-if you drill it down

31:26.333 --> 31:28.750
it means the company knew..

31:28.834 --> 31:30.166
There's our smoking gun.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.125
That spin doctor, Wyatt.

31:32.208 --> 31:35.875
Bad PR from a big, fat liar.

31:35.959 --> 31:37.542
I'd like to see him spin this.

31:44.458 --> 31:45.458
What'd you talk about

31:45.542 --> 31:46.750
'last time you saw Jane?'

31:46.834 --> 31:48.041
(Wyatt)
'A few fundraisers.'

31:48.125 --> 31:49.959
I told you,
I-I barely knew
her.

31:50.041 --> 31:54.458
That why you called
her about at 11:46 P.M.

31:54.542 --> 31:57.000
the night before she
was killed? A Fundraiser?

31:57.083 --> 32:00.333
Shaw Plastics was knowingly
harming people, hmm?

32:00.417 --> 32:03.834
Company falsified the results
of mandatory drug tests

32:03.917 --> 32:06.083
to flush out anyone
who opened their mouth.

32:07.250 --> 32:08.625
And you knew about it.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.834
The thing is,
21 years later

32:10.917 --> 32:12.125
you're still working there.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.333
- What's that make you?
- This is ridiculous.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.792
You people don't know
what you're talking
about.

32:19.750 --> 32:23.125
(Jane)
'Can you...explain
what that means exactly?'

32:23.208 --> 32:25.917
Well, if-if you drill it down

32:26.000 --> 32:29.250
it means the company knew
asbestos was causing cancer.

32:30.792 --> 32:34.834
'And instead of doing
anything about it'

32:34.917 --> 32:36.792
'they covered it up.'

32:40.792 --> 32:43.291
I'm gonna ask again.

32:43.375 --> 32:46.500
What were you calling about
night before she died?

32:48.750 --> 32:51.458
I didn't kill her.

32:51.542 --> 32:52.875
"You did the right thing.

32:52.959 --> 32:55.083
Don't make any
decisions tonight."

32:55.166 --> 32:57.125
Got your conversation
on tape.

32:57.208 --> 32:58.375
You drill it down

32:58.458 --> 33:00.417
she was trying to
warm your cold feet.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.375
Interview never aired.
You changed your mind.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.625
And got rid of her
to cover it up.

33:03.709 --> 33:06.208
"I'll be there
in 20 minutes."

33:06.291 --> 33:07.375
She was going
to meet you

33:07.458 --> 33:09.041
makes you the last
to see her alive.

33:09.125 --> 33:12.583
I was trying to help those
people who were getting
sick.

33:12.667 --> 33:16.208
I tried.
I really
did.

33:16.291 --> 33:19.625
And then I thought about
what the company would do.

33:19.709 --> 33:21.375
Intimidation, blacklists..

33:21.458 --> 33:22.875
People's lives get ruined.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.083
Lives did get ruined.

33:24.166 --> 33:27.041
It takes courage
being a whistle-blower.

33:27.125 --> 33:30.125
Heavy lifting for
a schmuck like you.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.375
Family corporation
and all.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.625
I thought I
could
talk her out of
it.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.166
I shouldn't
have
talked to you.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.500
I want you to
destroy the
tape.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.250
I gave Briggs
my word, David.

33:47.333 --> 33:50.166
Look, what the company
is doing is wrong.

33:50.250 --> 33:52.458
- That-that's not the issue.
- So what is?

33:54.750 --> 33:58.041
What are they gonna do
to us when they find
out?

33:58.125 --> 34:00.208
Once the story's out,
Shaw can't touch us.

34:00.291 --> 34:01.917
Everyone will
know the truth.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.250
Don't back out
on us, David.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.000
Every minute we sit here
someone else gets sick.

34:08.208 --> 34:09.834
Now, tell me
you're with me.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.375
Alright.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.875
For every one of
those people..

34:19.208 --> 34:20.750
...thank you.

34:40.041 --> 34:41.834
I called Powers.

34:41.917 --> 34:44.250
Bastard was sailing
in the Cayman
Islands.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.750
You...told him
about Jane?

34:46.834 --> 34:49.208
The interview
you gave her?

34:49.291 --> 34:51.917
I thought he'd fire me.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.542
Instead I got promoted.

34:54.750 --> 34:56.250
Keeping his enemies closer.

34:56.333 --> 34:59.125
Well, you keep your 401(k)

34:59.208 --> 35:00.917
and Jane ends up dead.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
You sleep at night?

35:02.083 --> 35:04.667
I asked him
to fix the
problem

35:04.750 --> 35:08.333
so that more people
would not get sick.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.583
What'd he say he was
gonna do about it?

35:12.709 --> 35:15.500
He said all he had to
do
was call the station

35:15.583 --> 35:17.583
and the story
would
disappear.

35:19.792 --> 35:22.375
No wonder he didn't
stick around last time we
met.

35:25.583 --> 35:28.709
(Vera)
'Andrew Powers?'

35:28.792 --> 35:30.250
Remember that
asbestos scandal

35:30.333 --> 35:31.500
you covered up
back in '88?

35:31.583 --> 35:33.041
Looks like it's
making a comeback.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.125
If you got stock
in the company

35:34.208 --> 35:35.542
you might wanna
call your broker.

35:35.625 --> 35:36.542
Insider information tip.

35:36.625 --> 35:38.041
- 'Andrew.'
- Yeah.

35:38.125 --> 35:39.542
(male #6)
'I'll meet you at
the restaurant.'

35:42.583 --> 35:43.542
What do you want?

35:43.625 --> 35:44.959
We're thinking
you're a conspirator

35:45.041 --> 35:46.875
to the murder
of Jane Everett.

35:46.959 --> 35:48.041
Murder?

35:48.125 --> 35:49.291
I didn't touch that girl.

35:49.375 --> 35:50.458
I was in
the Cayman
Islands.

35:50.542 --> 35:51.667
(Vera)
'We know.'

35:51.750 --> 35:54.333
You called someone at WCNU
from your house

35:54.417 --> 35:56.959
a few hours before
Jane showed up dead.

35:57.041 --> 35:58.208
Got the phone records
to prove it.

35:58.291 --> 35:59.750
(Jeffries)
'You tell us
who you called'

35:59.834 --> 36:01.500
maybe the conspiracy
goes away.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.709
I only
wanted
to kill a
story.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.875
Never intended for
anyone to get hurt.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.208
We'll let
the jury decide that.

36:10.291 --> 36:11.917
All we want is a name.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.750
You friends with
Andrew Powers, Nathan?

36:21.834 --> 36:23.875
Station covered a
few
Shaw fundraisers

36:23.959 --> 36:26.000
but no, I didn't
know
him personally.

36:28.125 --> 36:30.375
Think of any reason why
he might've been calling

36:30.458 --> 36:32.917
your extension
at WCNU from his house

36:33.000 --> 36:35.500
in the Cayman Islands?

36:35.583 --> 36:37.709
Corporate bigwigs liked
throwing their weight
around

36:37.792 --> 36:38.834
bitching about a story

36:38.917 --> 36:40.875
so sometimes they call.

36:40.959 --> 36:42.125
Mm-hmm.

36:42.208 --> 36:44.083
Uh, this particular
conversation

36:44.166 --> 36:46.667
happened at 1:15
in the morning

36:46.750 --> 36:49.166
few hours before
Jane was killed.

36:50.667 --> 36:54.208
Probably had some idea
he wanted the station to
cover.

36:54.291 --> 36:56.000
Looked into your
financials, Nathan.

36:57.375 --> 36:58.291
Yeah?

36:58.375 --> 37:00.125
You bought stock
in Shaw Plastics

37:00.208 --> 37:03.625
two weeks before Meijers
bought the company, huh?

37:03.709 --> 37:06.458
Stroke of genius made you
a millionaire overnight.

37:06.542 --> 37:08.333
What can I say?
I had a good
broker.

37:08.417 --> 37:09.417
It was the '80s.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.166
Guys like Powers
were making millions

37:11.250 --> 37:13.375
and you wanted
a piece of the pie.

37:13.458 --> 37:15.000
Nothing wrong
with free
enterprise.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.500
Except there was nothing
free about it.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.667
The stock tip came
with strings attached.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.667
Powers was calling
you that night

37:20.750 --> 37:23.000
because he wanted
a story to go away.

37:23.083 --> 37:24.667
And he was right.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.542
Jane had no business
taking that
interview.

37:27.625 --> 37:30.000
I know David Wyatt
was no scientist.

37:30.083 --> 37:33.625
I mean, you had taught
her better than that.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.625
Letting her heart
lead a story.

37:35.709 --> 37:38.500
It's called
journalistic
integrity.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.917
You don't just take
the word of some PR
hack.

37:45.250 --> 37:47.166
How'd you know
about that interview?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.291
What?

37:50.375 --> 37:52.500
The one Jane had
with David Wyatt

37:52.583 --> 37:54.083
that "PR hack"?

37:55.750 --> 37:56.834
Did Powers tell you about it?

37:56.917 --> 37:59.000
Or..

37:59.083 --> 38:00.250
...was it Jane?

38:03.500 --> 38:04.667
I'd never hurt Jane.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.500
- She was like your daughter.
- She was.

38:07.583 --> 38:08.917
Sending you those
stories every week.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.417
Coming to work for me.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.542
But she was still
holding onto something.

38:12.625 --> 38:15.041
What, what was that
you called it? "Journalistic--

38:15.125 --> 38:16.667
Integrity.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.000
It wasn't
as simple for you.

38:18.083 --> 38:21.333
You had suits to answer to.
The ratings to get.

38:21.417 --> 38:24.291
Hard not getting swept up in
the bonuses, the kickbacks..

38:24.375 --> 38:26.542
The business demanded
it.
It was sink or swim!

38:26.625 --> 38:29.125
You just wanted that tape.
It's a simple request.

38:29.208 --> 38:30.542
That's all I wanted!

38:33.792 --> 38:35.000
But Jane refused.

38:36.917 --> 38:39.375
She knew that if
she gave it to
me..

38:40.709 --> 38:42.250
...we'd both be lost.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.041
Nathan?

38:55.125 --> 38:56.792
What are you
doing here? I've been..

38:56.875 --> 38:58.542
I've been trying
to reach you all night.

38:58.625 --> 39:01.208
I thought it was time
to take care of this.

39:01.291 --> 39:02.375
Ooh!

39:02.458 --> 39:03.750
So what'd you wanna
talk to me about?

39:03.834 --> 39:06.375
I know I asked
for a celebrity special

39:06.458 --> 39:08.959
but...I have a story.

39:09.041 --> 39:10.250
I have a real story.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.917
The kind that we used to
talk about at Syracuse.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Tell me.

39:15.083 --> 39:17.583
Employees at Shaw Plastics
are getting sick.

39:17.667 --> 39:19.583
I found an executive
who admitted management

39:19.667 --> 39:21.208
knew they were being
exposed to asbestos.

39:21.291 --> 39:24.709
It's a toxin
that causes cancer.

39:24.792 --> 39:26.709
I got him on tape
reading the memo.

39:29.417 --> 39:32.750
Jane Everett,
you cracked a
story.

39:32.834 --> 39:34.250
We break this story.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.417
I mean, employees get a chance
at getting their compensation.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.375
They get, they get
their medical bills paid.

39:38.458 --> 39:39.583
Right.

39:39.667 --> 39:42.667
So, uh, where is it?

39:42.750 --> 39:44.166
What..
Where's what?

39:44.250 --> 39:45.417
The tape.

39:45.500 --> 39:48.125
- It's-it's in a safe
place.
- Great.

39:48.208 --> 39:50.250
I'll need to vet
it
with, uh, legal
first.

39:50.333 --> 39:53.500
Legal? No, these people don't
have that kind of time,
Nathan.

39:53.583 --> 39:54.709
We're exposed on this.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.250
Shaw could take us
to the cleaners.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.625
We need to be responsible

39:57.709 --> 39:59.959
to our advertisers
and to corporate
sponsors.

40:00.041 --> 40:01.458
Then I'll take it
to another station.

40:01.542 --> 40:03.458
Are you kidding me?
We'll lose our jobs!

40:03.542 --> 40:04.750
Be sued for slander.

40:04.834 --> 40:06.583
This isn't college, Jane.

40:06.667 --> 40:07.792
This is business.

40:07.875 --> 40:10.375
Now what's it gonna take
for you to see that?

40:15.625 --> 40:17.333
One million.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.041
I always knew
you were smart,
Everett.

40:25.166 --> 40:26.709
A million it is.

40:29.750 --> 40:31.083
Wait. Hey.
Where you going?

40:31.166 --> 40:33.083
You were the one who
lectured me about
ethics.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.333
Come on, Jane.

40:34.417 --> 40:36.083
News isn't news anymore.

40:36.166 --> 40:37.709
You love it just
as much as anybody.

40:37.792 --> 40:39.125
- The ratings, the
attention.
- No.

40:39.208 --> 40:40.542
- Not anymore!
- Come here!

40:40.625 --> 40:42.333
- Just stay away from me!
- Get over here!

40:42.417 --> 40:43.667
Stay away from me!

40:43.750 --> 40:45.041
Give me the damn tape!

40:45.125 --> 40:46.333
No!

40:50.083 --> 40:51.291
Stop!
