Holy Father,
2
it's tradition to address
the faithful and friends in the square
3
within the next few hours.
4
Of course. I know. It will be done.
5
Excellent.
6
We are here to help you
with anything you may need, Holy Father.
7
What I need is to be alone for a moment.
8
I'm sorry, my child.
9
I am exhausted, and I would like
to prepare myself better for the speech.
10
Put me through
to the Commander of the Swiss Guard.
11
Â Superion? What's happening?
12
I don't know.
13
But this will be
the shortest Papacy in history.
14
What are you talking about?
15
Father Vincent and the girls.
16
They figured out what you did.
17
Why you did it.
18
Is this their doing?
19
Does it matter?
20
You initiated all of this.
21
You destroyed the Order.
22
You spilled blood in its sacred walls.
23
I was protecting the Order.
As I have always done.
24
By killing Sister Shannon?
25
That's how you protect us?
26
What? Sister Shannon?
27
What are you talking about?
28
I didn't kill anyone.
29
I've been trying to protect my reputation.
30
Keep it and the OCS intact
so I could win this election.
31
And the bones?
32
Bones?
33
What bones?
34
What are you accusing me of?
35
I asked you a question.
36
Who is making such accusations against me?
