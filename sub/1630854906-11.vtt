WEBVTT

00:03.921 --> 00:06.382
What's up, fam?
I'm back to help you

00:06.465 --> 00:09.635
with all your smoking needs
in the birthplace of America,

00:09.760 --> 00:13.264
City of Brotherly Love,
the city that loves you back.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.141
[chuckles]
Like me. Sammy D.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.268
And I'm live at the Quick Stop
in Crum Lynne

00:17.768 --> 00:19.645
shopping for
a decent blunt wrap.

00:19.729 --> 00:21.981
Let's take a look
at the inventory, shall we?

00:22.064 --> 00:24.984
Oh, wow! Check this out.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.862
This is like your OG
smoker paradise right here.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.490
You got your basic hemp leaf,
organic wraps.

00:31.574 --> 00:34.201
Shoot, flavors galore.
You can't go wrong.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.203
-Rose petal wraps.
-[door bell chimes]

00:36.287 --> 00:38.622
[sniffs] If you want to
feel boujee, I guess.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.040
[chuckles]

00:40.124 --> 00:41.917
[door bell chimes]

00:44.253 --> 00:45.880
[ominous music plays]

00:54.847 --> 00:56.348
[lock clicks]

00:58.684 --> 01:00.019
-Hands in the air!
-[gasps]

01:00.102 --> 01:01.395
Everyone! Now!

01:01.479 --> 01:02.646
[woman screams]

01:02.730 --> 01:05.858
You, with the phone!
Drop that phone!

01:23.083 --> 01:25.419
[cellphone rings]

01:25.544 --> 01:26.920
Harold Cooper.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.298
Harold, I sent you a news link.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.930
We're following breaking news
as we come to you live this morning.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.182
Local police are working
a hostage situation

01:38.265 --> 01:39.975
at a convenience store
outside Philadelphia.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.519
Why am I watching this?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.854
A young man was live-streaming
when the gunman entered.

01:43.938 --> 01:47.191
The footage went viral.
I think I saw Raymond inside.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.151
I'm on my way
to pick up Ressler.

01:49.235 --> 01:52.363
Wait. Reddington is
holding up a food mart?

01:52.530 --> 01:54.198
He appears to be a hostage.

01:54.365 --> 01:55.658
Why is he in Philadelphia?

01:55.741 --> 01:56.991
I don't know.

01:57.076 --> 01:58.869
I tried calling him,
but he wouldn't answer.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.621
[reporter] This video contains
threats of violence...

02:00.704 --> 02:02.164
Hold on, Dembe.

02:02.248 --> 02:03.999
...and may be disturbing
to some viewers.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.626
Two hundred
and sixty-eight followers!

02:05.709 --> 02:07.628
[man] Hands in the air!
Everyone! Now!

02:07.711 --> 02:09.045
[woman screams]

02:09.128 --> 02:12.633
You, with the phone! Drop that phone!

02:12.716 --> 02:14.176
[keyboard clicking]

02:14.260 --> 02:15.719
It does look like him, doesn't it?

02:16.720 --> 02:18.597
You really think that's Reddington?

02:18.681 --> 02:20.641
Can we take a chance it's not?

02:20.724 --> 02:23.727
If Raymond is arrested
in front of TV cameras, we can't help him.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.646
This task force is already
hanging by a threat.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.815
Cynthia Panabaker
is coming in to the Post Office today.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.484
She wants a briefing
on the status of Wujing

02:30.568 --> 02:32.653
-and the Troll Farmer.
-You haven't told her?

02:32.736 --> 02:35.656
That Reddington executed Wujing
and recruited the Troll Farmer?

02:35.739 --> 02:37.992
No, I haven't figured out
how to explain that yet.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.035
This is not the day
to be behind the curve,

02:40.119 --> 02:43.247
so let's get ahead of
this hostage situation.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.880
I'm sorry to barge in,
but there's a viral video out there,

02:50.963 --> 02:52.298
and I swear it looks just like Reddington.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.382
Reddington. I know.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.216
Ressler and Dembe
are on their way.

02:55.301 --> 02:58.387
-What can I do?
-We have a separate fire to put out.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.098
I need you to conduct
an inventory of our case files.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.892
Seriously? W-Why?

03:02.975 --> 03:05.102
Senator Panabaker is
on her way here right now.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.479
She doesn't know Reddington
used the HexRoot program

03:07.563 --> 03:08.772
to tamper with our database.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.399
If Main Justice learns the truth,

03:10.482 --> 03:12.651
I need to find out exactly
what damage he's done.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.070
I'll do whatever you need,
but my security clearance

03:15.154 --> 03:17.573
doesn't give me access
to all of your cases.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.575
Oh, you've tried to open them?

03:19.658 --> 03:20.993
Uh...

03:23.162 --> 03:27.207
I was curious about some
of my mother's old cases,

03:27.291 --> 03:28.792
specifically her last case.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.586
You want to know why she was killed.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.504
It's why I joined this task force.

03:33.756 --> 03:35.758
I've asked around,
but nobody can tell me anything

03:35.841 --> 03:38.135
because it's above my clearance level.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.678
Not anymore.

03:39.762 --> 03:42.348
I received approval for
your interim TS/SCI clearance

03:42.430 --> 03:43.515
a couple of days ago.

03:43.599 --> 03:47.186
Our entire system is open to you,
but today I need you to stay on task.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.564
Conduct a damage assessment
and report to me.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.151
[police radio chattering indistinctly]

03:54.234 --> 03:56.362
[siren wails]

03:56.445 --> 03:58.155
[people chattering indistinctly]

04:07.539 --> 04:10.459
Look at this.
This is not good.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.836
I just hope Raymond isn't inside.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.547
There's a Zoomer Car. Isn't that how
he's been getting around these days?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.048
One of the ways.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.969
-How do we explain our presence here?
-Lie.

04:20.803 --> 04:24.014
Ah. Agent Ressler, FBI.
This is Agent Zuma.

04:24.223 --> 04:27.768
The suspect inside that store fits
the profile of a man we've been chasing

04:27.851 --> 04:29.687
for multiple armed robberies
across state lines.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.648
Thank God. We've been doing out best
here till the big guns arrive.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.067
We'll take it from here.
What's the situation inside?

04:35.150 --> 04:38.445
Subject is armed and barricaded
with an unknown number of hostages.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.739
We're maintaining a perimeter
with six uniforms,

04:40.823 --> 04:42.032
two covering the back exit.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.575
Have you attempted to make contact?

04:43.659 --> 04:47.162
No. I mean, sort of.
I was the first responder.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.540
When I pulled up, the assailant
saw me through the window

04:49.623 --> 04:53.043
and shouted to stay back
or he'd start killing hostages.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.962
We're just...
We're a small borough, you know?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.047
We don't get these kinds
of situations out here.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.842
Did anyone make it
out of the store when the gunman entered?

04:59.925 --> 05:03.012
No, but there was a woman
inside right before.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.014
County sent over
this mobile command truck.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.016
-She's waiting in there.
-Thank you.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.185
Okay, so, I had just bought
my little morning coffee,

05:10.269 --> 05:12.021
and I was heading to the car,

05:12.104 --> 05:14.398
when I saw the devil himself
walking my way, right?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.358
Like, I'll never forget those dark eyes.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.318
He was strung out
like a research monkey.

05:18.402 --> 05:21.697
I knew he was up to no good
even before I got a look at that revolver.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.700
Are you sure it was a revolver?

05:24.783 --> 05:27.870
Yes, sir. I saw the cylinder.

05:27.953 --> 05:32.916
Look, my daddy always said he'd rather
have six absolutes than 15 maybes.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.378
You know, on account
of semi-automatic misfires.

05:36.462 --> 05:39.131
We sure could use your help
identifying those hostages.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.925
Uh, can you tell us who was
inside the store when you left?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.427
I... Let's see.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.345
There was, um... There was Ji-Min.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.222
She's this real nice Korean lady.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.849
She sells me my Powerball tickets.

05:48.932 --> 05:53.020
And there was, uh,
the stoner kid with, like, his iPhone,

05:53.103 --> 05:56.065
and, um, an old woman.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.816
Oh, and I saw an older man, too.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.777
Was that the man wearing the fedora?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.695
The man had a fedora, definitely.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.323
I love those hats.
They're so stylish, right?

06:04.406 --> 06:06.450
So, a total of four hostages, then?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.077
Wait. I...
There might have been somebody

06:08.160 --> 06:10.871
wearing a Phillies hat, as well?

06:10.954 --> 06:12.331
I remember the hat.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.041
So maybe five hostages?

06:14.917 --> 06:16.251
Maybe.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.546
-[cellphone rings]
-Harold Cooper.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.674
Lot of signs point to Reddington
as a hostage inside the store.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.551
Look. We've tried texting him,
but no luck.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.053
This is Reddington
we're talking about.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.554
I can't believe he hasn't
pumped the gunman

06:27.638 --> 06:28.931
full of bullets by now.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.265
Well, maybe he's waiting
for us to take control

06:30.349 --> 06:33.560
of the situation out here
so he can avoid public exposure.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.729
-Can you control the scene?
-Not without help.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.732
I'd like authorization
to call in a TAC team, one of our own.

06:38.816 --> 06:41.443
We got to clear out this
local PD and the news media,

06:41.527 --> 06:44.071
-take complete command out here.
-Excellent idea.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.657
Make sure the TAC team
includes a hostage negotiator.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.700
Get those people out safely.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.911
Cynthia. It's good to see you.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.412
You say that now.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.082
Is there someplace
we can talk, Harold?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.334
Cooper signed off on a TAC team.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.877
I'll make sure they get here fast.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.712
[Dembe] It won't happen
fast enough.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.591
You gotta be kidding me. SWAT?

07:04.675 --> 07:07.678
Philly's best.
I told you the big guns were on their way.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.680
They were the first ones I called.

07:15.144 --> 07:18.438
Sergeant McGinley,
we appreciate your presence here,

07:18.522 --> 07:20.774
but a federal HRT team
will be here within the hour.

07:20.858 --> 07:24.236
I'm sure the armed suspect inside
will show the courtesy to wait.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.155
Powers, set up an inner perimeter

07:26.238 --> 07:28.157
and find a wall
to snake a camera through.

07:28.407 --> 07:29.992
I want to see what
we're up against in there.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.285
You have building schematics yet?

07:31.368 --> 07:33.036
I don't think you heard me.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.081
I'm part of an FBI unit that reports
directly to the Attorney General.

07:36.165 --> 07:39.918
You make any intrusion into that building,
you're gonna face Main Justice.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.336
I know how to follow orders,

07:41.420 --> 07:42.588
but the second this turns into

07:42.671 --> 07:45.007
an active-shooter situation,
this is my show.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.095
[door closes]

07:50.179 --> 07:51.805
I don't know how we're
gonna sneak Reddington

07:51.889 --> 07:54.391
out of this circus,
even with our own TAC team.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.810
The DSL line into the building was cut.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.937
Local PD just reconnected it for me.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.564
I'm calling inside now.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.691
Well, I just hope
our gunman's trigger finger

08:02.774 --> 08:04.610
isn't as itchy as our
SWAT friend out there.

08:04.735 --> 08:05.777
[line ringing]

08:06.904 --> 08:08.488
[telephone rings]

08:09.406 --> 08:10.782
[Ji-Min] Quick Stop. Can I help you?

08:10.908 --> 08:12.618
This is Agent Zuma with the FBI.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.703
Everything is under control out here.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.872
Is everyone okay inside there?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.874
He wants to know if everyone's okay.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.710
No! Nothing is okay in here!

08:21.793 --> 08:25.339
If anyone comes close to this store,
I start shooting people!

08:25.422 --> 08:28.717
Please, let him know that
no one is coming inside.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.385
Hang up the phone!

08:30.469 --> 08:31.887
-Now!
-[dial tone sounds]

08:31.970 --> 08:33.722
[McGinley] That boy in there
is gonna start shooting

08:33.804 --> 08:36.475
before your HRT team gets here.
You know that, right?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.778
Last week, you walked
a notorious criminal

09:29.861 --> 09:31.989
into my office, one Mr. Bo Chang.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.324
Why? Because he had
just stolen a dangerous

09:34.408 --> 09:35.993
cyber weapon from the NSA.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.829
You then allowed Mr. Chang
to escape from your custody.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.622
Why? Because unknown to him,

09:40.706 --> 09:43.667
he was actually escaping from
an exact replica of this building

09:43.750 --> 09:46.837
that was painstakingly recreated
by Raymond Reddington.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.340
Why? To lure Wujing,
an even more notorious criminal,

09:50.424 --> 09:51.717
to his unwitting arrest.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.552
[inhales sharply]

09:53.635 --> 09:56.221
If ever there was a story
whose ending I wanted to find out more,

09:56.305 --> 09:58.223
I can't think of it, but, Harold,

09:58.307 --> 10:00.225
since our last meeting,
you've been more mute

10:00.309 --> 10:01.685
than a mime at mass.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.854
Our plan ran into complications.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.480
We waited at the duplicate Post Office,

10:05.564 --> 10:07.691
-but Wujing never showed.
-How come?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.818
He went to the real Post Office instead.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.155
When we returned, we found his body
and the body of his associate.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.823
Both had been shot.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.199
Where are the bodies now?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.784
In cold storage.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.787
Why am I only learning of this now?

10:20.871 --> 10:23.081
We're still investigating
to determine exactly what happened.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.333
The cameras were wiped.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.669
I'm gonna save you some time
and tell you what happened.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.004
Reddington happened.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.840
He didn't build a Post Office
to fool Wujing.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.885
He built it to fool you,
and you played right into his hands.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.722
Standing guard for an attack
that was never gonna come.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.434
How did Wujing get the real address?

10:42.517 --> 10:45.270
I have to believe Reddington
fed it to him somehow

10:45.354 --> 10:47.105
so he could
execute Wujing himself

10:47.189 --> 10:48.982
instead of allowing us
to arrest him.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.611
Executing a man
inside a federal facility.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.988
It's gonna spell
the end of us, Harold.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.450
Reddington's days
of going unchecked are over.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.994
Where is he now?

11:02.537 --> 11:05.457
[police radio chattering indistinctly]

11:05.749 --> 11:07.250
Choppers are 20 minutes out.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.378
Twenty minutes?
This could be over in five.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.631
I need details on what kind of threat
we're dealing with inside there.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.425
What's our gunman's name?
Any criminal record?

11:15.509 --> 11:17.636
We're not authorized
to share that information.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.514
Look, I am sick and tired of
getting jerked around by the two of you.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.182
[gun fires]

11:22.265 --> 11:24.768
Active shooter.
All teams, breacher up on my go!

11:24.851 --> 11:26.269
[Ressler] Stand down, Sergeant!

11:26.353 --> 11:28.522
No. Blind intrusions
only puts hostages at risk.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.148
-So do bullets.
-One bullet.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.275
And we don't know
if anyone inside is hurt.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.403
-[keypad beeping]
-I'm calling inside.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.446
[line ringing]

11:40.534 --> 11:42.744
This is a mistake. You're gonna
get everyone in that store killed.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.621
If we have a chance to
deescalate the situation,

11:44.704 --> 11:46.498
then that's what we'll do.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.710
[line ringing]

11:50.794 --> 11:52.671
-That's it. We're going in.
-No, you will not!

11:52.754 --> 11:54.548
[line ringing]

11:56.091 --> 11:58.135
This is Agent Ressler with the FBI.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.970
We need to know
if anyone's hurt inside.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.638
Please, answer the phone.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.640
[line ringing]

12:08.061 --> 12:11.648
-All teams, on my go!
-No!

12:11.731 --> 12:15.110
Don't shoot!
You can come in now!

12:15.193 --> 12:16.820
Crazy man dead!

12:16.903 --> 12:19.656
All right. We'll take point.
You hold your team back.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.576
Do not enter unless I give you clearance.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.870
Stand down.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.375
[Dembe] Soon as we get inside,
we have to get Raymond out of sight.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.713
FBI agents. Everyone stay calm.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.301
He's dead.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.596
Is anyone else in here?

12:42.679 --> 12:43.930
Just us.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.724
Let's check the back,
just in case.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.686
-[door opens]
-[man] Go, go!

12:51.521 --> 12:52.981
[SWAT leader] Contact!
Give me a two! Back room!

12:53.064 --> 12:54.316
Hold that order.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.569
[officer] Keep your hands up!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.115
All clear. Nobody in back.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.160
Let's get medical help in here.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.832
[people chattering indistinctly
in distance]

13:14.628 --> 13:17.547
Good news. Sue just had
her 12-month doctor visit,

13:17.631 --> 13:21.801
and she is on target
with all of her developmental milestones.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.346
Except finger pointing,
which I always thought was rude.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.517
You all right?

13:29.518 --> 13:32.103
I don't know. I...

13:32.729 --> 13:36.650
Cooper asked me to sort through the files
Reddington tampered with,

13:36.733 --> 13:40.654
and I couldn't help but take a peek
at my mother's personnel file.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.406
Yeah, well, human nature.
I totally get it.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.076
There's a reference to me
in her FBI name check

13:46.159 --> 13:48.203
as "adopted child."

13:48.828 --> 13:51.039
So I pulled my birth certificate,

13:51.122 --> 13:53.458
which I've never read,
because, I mean, who has?

13:53.542 --> 13:58.672
And it shows that I was born
at a health clinic in Kolkata.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.382
I take it this is all news to you?

14:00.465 --> 14:03.385
My mother told me I was born in the UK.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.221
And to make matters worse,
I did some research,

14:06.304 --> 14:10.350
and I don't think that
health clinic ever existed.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.227
Maybe it's time to call your Pops?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.689
No, I don't want to drag him
into all this, or my brother,

14:15.772 --> 14:18.942
not until I know what's up,
if anything.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.072
She was always
so straightforward with me.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.700
If I was adopted,
she would have told me.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.287
It has to be a mistake, right?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.790
I mean, I have my grandmother's feet.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.002
I mean, there is one way to find out.

14:37.085 --> 14:41.047
This personnel file includes a copy
of Meera Malik's DNA profile.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.341
I could run a DNA test against yours.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.051
If you want.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.599
What I want is not
to have seen any of this.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.517
[sighs]

14:53.268 --> 14:56.062
[Ji-Min] The crazy man
came to rob the safe,

14:56.146 --> 14:57.564
hit me with his gun.

14:57.647 --> 15:01.526
Sammy tried to stop him.
Brave boy.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.820
They fought for gun like this.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.864
And then boom!

15:05.947 --> 15:07.532
Why did he hit you?
What set him off?

15:08.074 --> 15:11.870
You. Not you.
All you people out there.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.748
I told him,
"Put down the gun before you hurt us."

15:14.956 --> 15:16.708
That's when he hit me.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.754
-[door bell chimes]
-Excuse me.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.547
I ran our assailant's ID.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.758
His name's Jack Davis from Philly.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.968
Some minor drug offenses,
assault charges.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.345
[Dembe] A nobody, in other words.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.430
Yeah, I say we let the locals
close this one out.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.390
I don't see any reason
for us to stick around, do you?

15:32.474 --> 15:33.683
[Dembe] Yes, I do.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.311
The witness inside the store
before the robbery

15:36.394 --> 15:38.313
saw a gunman with a revolver.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.065
She was very clear about that.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.025
Look at the weapon
that was recovered here.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.236
[Ressler] That is
definitely not a revolver.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.031
A Browning High Power. Wooden grips.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.242
I'd recognize it anywhere.
That's Raymond's gun.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.329
And those are his clothes.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.165
We need to interview
these hostages, all of them.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.084
I want to know exactly
what went down in here

15:59.167 --> 16:01.252
and where the hell
Reddington went.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.009
All right, we're gonna go through this
from the very beginning, okay?

16:08.093 --> 16:10.512
So, where were you when
the suspect entered the store?

16:11.137 --> 16:13.932
Behind the counter.
Yelling at Sammy.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.434
Uh, then I heard a loud voice.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.561
Hands in the air! Everyone! Now!

16:18.645 --> 16:19.813
[Ji-Min screams]

16:19.896 --> 16:23.525
You, with the phone!
Drop that phone!

16:28.363 --> 16:31.157
You! Hands!

16:31.324 --> 16:32.951
Where were you standing at the time?

16:33.034 --> 16:35.704
[Sammy] Right here.
Right in front of the smoking accessories.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.081
Quick Stop has a fine selection,
if you're in the market.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.540
[Dembe] And the gentleman
in the fedora,

16:39.624 --> 16:41.584
where was he when
the assailant entered?

16:44.212 --> 16:46.089
It's just a Peanut Chew.
No cause for alarm.

16:46.172 --> 16:50.009
Move! Move over there!
All of you! Where I can see you!

16:50.176 --> 16:51.886
You were saying
that you were wearing both that coat

16:51.970 --> 16:53.179
and the hat at that time?

16:53.263 --> 16:55.432
Yeah. I love this coat.

16:55.515 --> 16:59.227
It's very slimming.
And, uh, the hat.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.605
You get to be my age,
you do what you can.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.442
My wife, Maxy, she loves the look.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.734
Humphrey Bogart.

17:07.569 --> 17:11.448
When I saw you in the viral video,
you were standing alone.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.157
I didn't see your wife.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.703
She was in the back.
Picking out a yogurt.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.874
And who screamed back there?
Who else is in this store?

17:23.752 --> 17:25.795
Please, don't shoot.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.381
Get your ass over there now!

17:29.758 --> 17:31.134
Now, you.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.761
Open the safe.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.513
No keys. Manager has the keys.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.515
-Here.
-[register beeps]

17:38.391 --> 17:39.934
Take the money and go!

17:41.186 --> 17:43.229
I'm not here for pocket change!

17:43.605 --> 17:45.023
I want the safe!

17:46.065 --> 17:48.610
-What time's the manager get in?
-8:30.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.363
Well, we'll wait.

17:53.907 --> 17:54.908
You!

17:56.201 --> 17:58.453
Turn that sign around
and shut the blinds!

18:04.584 --> 18:06.920
This is a bad plan.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.171
You see the camera?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.089
Yeah.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.551
You got a security camera, lady.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.887
And I bet you pushed
the silent alarm, too.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.849
But I cut the data line outside.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.935
I thought this out.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.731
And you're positive that you four
were the only ones inside this store,

18:26.815 --> 18:28.149
other than the gunman?

18:29.150 --> 18:30.693
I didn't see anyone else.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.279
A customer who was here
could have sworn she remembered

18:33.363 --> 18:35.240
seeing someone wearing
a Phillies cap.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.951
You mean those?

18:40.537 --> 18:42.831
That could have been
what she saw.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.958
Tell us more about
this gunshot we heard.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.502
Oh. That was terrifying.

18:50.672 --> 18:54.342
Damn it. Damn it!

18:54.425 --> 18:55.510
How did they know?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.555
One of you must have called!

18:58.638 --> 19:00.807
-Who called?
-You took my phone, man.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.643
My phone's on the charger
in the car.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.938
Hey. This is over.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.859
You put the gun down now
before people get hurt.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.485
Are you telling me what to do?

19:12.569 --> 19:13.820
No.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.655
-[screams]
-[all gasp]

19:15.905 --> 19:17.615
I give the orders here!

19:17.699 --> 19:19.742
[shouting indistinctly]

19:24.998 --> 19:26.040
[gun fires]

19:26.124 --> 19:27.625
[Ji-Min gasps] No!

19:35.925 --> 19:37.635
What am I supposed to do, Harold?

19:37.719 --> 19:39.554
We have a task force
built around an asset

19:39.637 --> 19:42.724
you can't control or reach
on a cellphone apparently.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.059
Reddington's been
more of a free spirit than usual lately.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.144
I can't deny it.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.397
I've lied to the AG
so many times to hide his indiscretions,

19:49.480 --> 19:52.150
but this time,
it's just too big to sweep under the rug.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.485
We'll find a path forward,
Cynthia. We always do.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.904
I know my path.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.530
I'm gonna meet
with the AG tomorrow

19:57.614 --> 19:59.866
and advise that he launch
a full DOJ investigation

19:59.949 --> 20:02.577
into the execution of Wujing
and his associate

20:02.660 --> 20:03.995
inside a federal facility,

20:04.704 --> 20:06.998
interviews, forensics,
autopsies, the works.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.375
You know that will spell
the end of this task force.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.170
You also know the good work
we do here.

20:12.503 --> 20:13.880
What can I do to change your mind?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.928
Get Reddington's ass
in front of me to explain himself.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.054
By the end of the day.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.349
Anything less, I'm going
to the Attorney General.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.896
[door opens and closes]

20:32.440 --> 20:33.650
[phone clicks]

20:33.733 --> 20:35.485
[line ringing]

20:35.568 --> 20:37.445
[Cooper] Ressler.
I need a status report.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.155
Well, we're about to head out.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.532
None of the hostages
put Reddington at the scene.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.242
He's not here physically now, so...

20:43.326 --> 20:44.786
Do you believe he was there?

20:44.869 --> 20:46.412
Honestly, I don't know
what to believe.

20:46.496 --> 20:50.583
We got a coat and a hat and a gun here
just like his, but no Reddington.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.086
I suppose it could
all be a coincidence.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.338
Look, the good news is
there's no hard proof either way,

20:55.421 --> 20:57.215
-so we dodged a bullet.
-I'm sorry to report

20:57.298 --> 20:59.175
there's an even bigger bullet
headed our way

20:59.258 --> 21:02.303
unless we can get Reddington
to Panabaker today.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.764
So, Agent Ressler, I'll ask you again.

21:04.973 --> 21:08.768
Do you believe that Reddington
was a hostage inside that store?

21:09.644 --> 21:10.853
Yeah, I do.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.564
Then you and Dembe
get back there and break those witnesses

21:13.898 --> 21:15.650
and find Reddington.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.991
[Ressler] I know you're all
ready to go home

21:23.074 --> 21:24.867
and, you know, leave
this nightmare behind you,

21:25.284 --> 21:27.245
but first I feel like
we could all use

21:27.328 --> 21:29.872
a little, um, sharing time.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.375
How about I go first?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.461
See, as an FBI agent,
I'm not in the business of responding

21:35.545 --> 21:37.922
to, uh, armed robberies,

21:38.006 --> 21:40.842
uh, by strung-out junkies
at roadside food marts.

21:41.175 --> 21:44.012
If I'm being honest with you,
what brought me here today

21:44.095 --> 21:46.723
is my pursuit of the FBI's
Most Wanted criminal,

21:46.806 --> 21:48.391
Raymond Reddington.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.769
But, then, I think
you already knew that.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.274
That is a fine hat.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.734
You mind if i take a closer look?

22:03.573 --> 22:04.949
Hmm!

22:05.033 --> 22:07.869
A Borsa... lino?

22:08.036 --> 22:10.413
-Is that Italian?
-I guess.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.623
Hmm. Sounds Italian.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.793
What about this coat?
Huh? Oh.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.378
Loro Piana.

22:18.504 --> 22:23.092
Why, this is the same brand
that's favored by our fugitive.

22:23.301 --> 22:26.220
Huh. I don't know much
about fashion,

22:26.304 --> 22:28.723
but my partner over here,
he sure follows the trends.

22:28.806 --> 22:32.226
Agent Zuma, what would you say
this, um, ensemble costs?

22:32.310 --> 22:33.728
About $5,000.

22:34.062 --> 22:37.231
Five thousand dollars?

22:37.315 --> 22:41.527
That's a lot of money
for a truck driver on disability, Ron.

22:42.361 --> 22:46.491
Now, Maxy, did you approve
this extravagant purchase?

22:49.202 --> 22:51.996
Bogart. I love Bogart.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.416
Bogart.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.253
[Dembe] Look,
we know you're all scared,

22:59.337 --> 23:03.216
and we know the gun left behind
belonged to our fugitive.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.427
What did he do?
Did he threaten you?

23:06.511 --> 23:08.971
Did he promise you money?

23:09.055 --> 23:12.975
We know he did something
to convince you to wear his clothes.

23:14.894 --> 23:18.022
And you... to make up a story.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.776
And you... to be a hero.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.365
All right. No more lies!

23:27.448 --> 23:30.743
All right, you tell me
exactly what went down inside this store,

23:30.827 --> 23:34.997
or we're arresting all of you
for aiding and abetting a wanted killer!

23:35.081 --> 23:36.999
Do you understand me?

23:41.504 --> 23:43.214
Okay, okay.

23:43.297 --> 23:46.384
There was a man here.
It's true.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.390
-This man?
-[Ji-Min] Yes, that's him.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.184
He walked into the store
right before the crazy guy.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.687
Wanted Peanut Chews.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.064
[Sammy] Check it out.

24:00.148 --> 24:03.651
You got your basic hemp leaf,
organic wraps.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.319
Man, flavors galore.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.030
Rose petal wraps.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.701
If you want to feel boujee,
I guess. [chuckles]

24:11.784 --> 24:15.580
Excuse me. Do you sell
Goldenberg's Peanut Chews?

24:15.663 --> 24:19.208
I can never resist the temptation
when in Philadelphia.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.335
Uh, second aisle on your right.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.462
Ah. Thank you.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.923
I think the yogurt cups
are in the back cooler.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.968
Oh, thank heaven.
I need my morning Go-Gurt.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.220
Hey. You open, you buy!

24:31.971 --> 24:34.432
-[shouting in Korean]
-[door bell chimes]

24:34.515 --> 24:36.392
[Sammy] Oh, I can see
you're very agitated, but listen.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.604
I'm giving you free publicity.
Yo, I got like 268 followers.

24:39.687 --> 24:42.899
Hands in the air! Everyone! Now!

24:43.065 --> 24:47.069
You, with the phone! Drop that phone!

24:50.364 --> 24:52.116
[Ji-Min gasps]

24:52.200 --> 24:54.577
You! Hands!

24:56.370 --> 25:00.166
Just a Peanut Chew.
No cause for alarm.

25:00.249 --> 25:05.421
So, the man standing
here in the video, that was Reddington.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.215
Most definitely, Officer.

25:07.298 --> 25:09.967
-We're agents.
-My bad.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.970
So I'm guessing you weren't
the one who shot the assailant.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.806
No, sir. Agent, sir.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.726
Why don't you tell us how
this gunshot really went down?

25:19.894 --> 25:21.771
[siren wails]

25:23.481 --> 25:26.692
Damn it! Damn it!

25:27.902 --> 25:30.029
How did they know?

25:30.112 --> 25:31.530
One of you must've called!

25:31.614 --> 25:33.407
Who called? You took my phone.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.952
My phone's on the charger in the car.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.120
Hey. This is over.

25:39.413 --> 25:42.208
Put gun down now
before people get hurt.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.085
Are you telling me what to do?

25:44.168 --> 25:45.336
No.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.130
-[screams]
-I give the orders here!

25:48.214 --> 25:49.632
[shouting indistinctly]

25:52.301 --> 25:53.552
Hey, pistol whip.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.846
-[gun fires]
-[women gasp]

25:57.014 --> 25:58.266
[panting]

26:04.897 --> 26:06.315
What did Reddington do next?

26:06.399 --> 26:08.150
He told us he was a wanted man.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.236
He said he's someone
we don't want to cross.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.029
He was holding a gun when he said it.

26:12.113 --> 26:13.739
He made me swap hats and coats.

26:13.823 --> 26:15.283
You were wearing a Phillies cap.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.828
He knew the FBI would come for him.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.746
But what if he comes after us?

26:20.830 --> 26:23.457
We'll provide
federal protection if necessary.

26:23.541 --> 26:26.210
But where is Reddington?
How did he get out of the building?

26:31.590 --> 26:32.800
[clears throat] Back door.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.052
He went through the back
when you came to the front.

26:35.136 --> 26:36.554
Did he say where he was going?

26:36.637 --> 26:38.681
He asked if there was a bus station.

26:38.764 --> 26:39.932
I told him two blocks east.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.067
You buy their story?

26:50.526 --> 26:54.572
It's not like Raymond to threaten
civilians, but he was cornered.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.703
Don't know how he could've
made it out without being seen.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.872
I mean, SWAT had this exit covered.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.790
The cashier said the gunman was dead.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.834
McGinley and his team
must've regrouped

27:06.917 --> 27:08.586
before they followed us inside.

27:08.669 --> 27:11.464
[sighs] It's like Brussels
all over again.

27:11.547 --> 27:16.010
I spent years hunting Reddington,
and he was always just one step ahead.

27:16.093 --> 27:19.096
We have a lead this time.
The bus station.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.932
Maybe we'll get one step
ahead of him this time.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.188
[people chattering indistinctly]

27:28.564 --> 27:32.318
Done. I ran a rapid analysis
on the DNA profiles in the system

27:32.401 --> 27:34.153
for you and your mother.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.740
Uh, and...

27:38.157 --> 27:42.078
And I printed out the results
and put it in this envelope.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.496
I didn't read it.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.664
I didn't want to violate,
you know, your privacy

27:45.748 --> 27:48.167
or open myself up
to any HR complaints.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.087
-Oh.
-You don't have to open that.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.506
I could tear that up right now
in teeny, tiny, little pieces,

27:53.589 --> 27:55.466
and we can forget
this ever happened.

28:05.059 --> 28:07.186
What would you do
if you found out today

28:07.269 --> 28:08.896
that you might be adopted?

28:08.979 --> 28:11.399
Oh, I'd be fine. I would celebrate.

28:11.482 --> 28:14.944
Boy, that would be
a doozy of a phone call with Mom and Dad.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.196
-[chuckles softly]
-I might make that call anyway.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.157
Look, did you like your childhood?

28:20.241 --> 28:21.742
Did you feel loved?

28:21.826 --> 28:23.994
Yeah.

28:24.078 --> 28:26.539
Right up until the point
when my mother was killed.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.377
If your world view
is working for you,

28:31.460 --> 28:35.423
why take a risk in fixing
something that isn't broken?

28:41.053 --> 28:42.471
Because I need to know.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.821
That world view?

29:00.239 --> 29:01.991
It's broken now.

29:14.003 --> 29:16.172
Any leads on Reddington?
We're running out of time

29:16.255 --> 29:17.423
if we're gonna get him
in front of Panabaker.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.841
[Dembe] We just left
the bus station.

29:18.924 --> 29:22.011
A bus bound for DC
departed shortly after Raymond escaped.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.679
We figure that that's
where he's going

29:23.762 --> 29:25.473
since the convenience store
is south of Philly.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.850
Excellent. Give me the bus number,
and we'll take over from here.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.310
[Ressler] We're gonna
check out his warehouse,

29:29.393 --> 29:31.854
see if he found
another way into town.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.150
[dispatcher] Bus 2250,
I've got an FBI agent on the line,

29:36.233 --> 29:37.776
-needs to talk to you.
-FBI?

29:37.860 --> 29:39.737
I'm gonna transfer.
Margo, you're on the line

29:39.820 --> 29:42.156
-with FBI Agent Siya Malik.
-[Siya] Margo, hello.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.408
I need to know if you have
a passenger on board.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.077
White male, 60s, ample build.

29:47.161 --> 29:49.580
May be wearing a gray jacket
and a Phillies cap.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.582
Sounds like half the men
who ride my bus.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.375
Hold on.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.003
I see a guy like that.

29:56.086 --> 29:59.340
Back seat. He's either
asleep or faking it.

29:59.423 --> 30:00.966
What do you want me to do?

30:01.050 --> 30:02.676
We're... We're about to
pull out of Baltimore.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.470
Stay on your route and act normal.

30:04.553 --> 30:07.556
I'm gonna meet you
at your last scheduled stop in DC.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.580
All right.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.582
-You coming?
-Isn't that a bit excessive?

30:33.666 --> 30:35.084
It's just Raymond.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.752
What are you gonna do, shoot him?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.796
Just wait here.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.933
-Hey.
-What the--

30:51.016 --> 30:54.311
Oh. Sorry.

30:54.395 --> 30:55.688
Uh...

30:55.980 --> 30:57.314
[manager] When can I open my store?

30:58.065 --> 30:59.692
People are gonna
be dying to shop here

30:59.775 --> 31:00.901
after the shootout today.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.278
Look, the crime scene
is released,

31:02.361 --> 31:05.239
but you can't reopen until you
hire a cleanup crew, all right?

31:05.322 --> 31:06.865
That's a lot of blood.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.952
[police radio chattering indistinctly]

31:12.204 --> 31:14.206
[door opens and closes]

31:20.588 --> 31:22.256
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh

31:22.339 --> 31:23.799
[door closes]

31:23.882 --> 31:26.510
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, uh-huh

31:26.594 --> 31:28.679
[speaking Korean]

31:28.762 --> 31:31.140
That was fast thinking.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.100
"The back door." Good one.

31:33.183 --> 31:36.103
-You really think that one dude bought it?
-I hope so.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.397
If our new friend makes good
on all the stuff he promised us,

31:38.480 --> 31:40.316
I'll never have to work
another day in my life.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.901
You're already on disability, dear.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.405
What if we went
through all this and he blows us off?

31:46.697 --> 31:49.700
No. He's an honorable man.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.622
He saved our lives.
He will do as he says. Hmm?

31:59.668 --> 32:01.795
Show me your wild side

32:01.879 --> 32:02.963
[gun fires]

32:03.047 --> 32:04.673
[women gasp]

32:09.887 --> 32:11.055
Well, that was unpleasant.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.891
We don't have much time.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.268
I'm a wanted criminal.

32:16.602 --> 32:20.105
The worst of the worst,
if you believe the FBI's list.

32:20.189 --> 32:23.525
Of course, I'm not much
of a list person myself.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.028
I prefer to rely on my instincts

32:26.111 --> 32:29.239
when it comes to judging
someone's character.

32:29.323 --> 32:31.158
-[telephone rings]
-Ignore that.

32:32.368 --> 32:35.287
-[telephone ringing]
-[Reddington grunts]

32:38.832 --> 32:41.669
Okay. So, here's what happened.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.170
The bad guy here, he...

32:43.253 --> 32:44.505
What's your name, dear?

32:44.922 --> 32:46.131
Ji-Min.

32:46.799 --> 32:50.386
He struck Ji-Min with his gun.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.931
Our young Internet-er
rushed to her aid,

32:54.014 --> 32:57.476
fought over the weapon,
and it went off.

32:58.519 --> 33:01.438
Sir, if you don't mind,
your jacket, please.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.357
Wait. You want us to lie to the cops?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.484
Well, I could
frighten you all and tell you

33:05.567 --> 33:08.529
that I'll have my people
do their worst,

33:08.612 --> 33:11.073
but what's the point
when it's so much easier

33:11.156 --> 33:12.700
to make you happy?

33:12.783 --> 33:14.827
Or at least make you rich.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.787
[Ressler] This is Agent Ressler
with the FBI.

33:16.870 --> 33:19.289
We need to know
if anyone inside is hurt,

33:19.373 --> 33:21.917
so please answer the phone.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.128
-How rich?
-[telephone rings]

33:24.211 --> 33:27.715
Jackpot rich. Wish-come-true rich.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.384
Rich enough to pay all your bills

33:30.467 --> 33:33.512
and start something new,
something exciting.

33:34.012 --> 33:37.433
Ji-Min, do you have a favorite bar?

33:37.516 --> 33:38.559
Chikin Ba.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.102
Chikin Ba?

33:42.354 --> 33:46.024
I'll send a representative
to meet all of you there tonight.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.443
He'll have your money.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.362
All I need now is a way
to get out of here.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.491
Oh, dear.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.287
[sighs]

34:18.098 --> 34:19.933
[door bell chimes]

34:28.065 --> 34:29.610
[beeps]

34:37.201 --> 34:39.328
[Siya] I made it through
the case files.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.330
As expected,
Reddington used the HexRoot program

34:41.413 --> 34:43.415
to scrub himself from the records.

34:43.665 --> 34:46.293
Any references to him
or the intel he provided

34:46.376 --> 34:48.003
are missing or redacted.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.547
-What about his immunity agreement?
-Gone.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.507
It's like he was
never part of this team.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.426
I don't understand
Raymond's play here.

34:54.802 --> 34:58.430
He's left himself completely unprotected
from prosecution by the US government.

34:58.514 --> 35:01.350
What happens tomorrow
when Panabaker turns us over to the DOJ?

35:01.433 --> 35:02.851
I mean, we're the ones
who are gonna take

35:02.935 --> 35:04.603
the full blame
for Wujing's murder.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.396
Panabaker will do what she does.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.441
If we have to face Main Justice,
we'll mount the best defense possible,

35:09.525 --> 35:12.361
but we can't do anything
until we locate our asset,

35:12.444 --> 35:14.363
who's becoming more erratic
by the hour.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.156
Once we find him,
I'll need someone

35:16.240 --> 35:18.700
who can keep eyes on him
at all times.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.328
I'll do it.
I don't have a life.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.413
The assignment is yours.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.208
Everyone, go home,
get a good night's sleep.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.378
Tomorrow, we'll discuss
the best strategy to handle the DOJ.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.634
Agent Malik, a moment.

35:36.343 --> 35:40.222
I'm just checking in. Are you okay?
Are you sure you want to do this?

35:41.014 --> 35:42.307
Yes.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.017
But...

35:46.228 --> 35:48.480
I went through the case files today.

35:49.231 --> 35:50.649
All the case files.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.069
You read how your mother died.

35:54.236 --> 35:55.737
Among other things.

35:56.780 --> 35:59.741
The file said that she was
attacked in a nightclub

35:59.825 --> 36:02.369
from behind
and her throat was slit.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.913
I'm sorry.

36:04.997 --> 36:08.208
It's okay. I expected the worst.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.461
What I didn't expect was...

36:15.007 --> 36:16.508
I joined this team
because I wanted to know

36:16.592 --> 36:18.051
what happened to her.

36:18.135 --> 36:20.178
And why.

36:20.846 --> 36:25.601
This task force had the answers,
so I wanted to be one of you,

36:25.684 --> 36:29.104
find out if her death
meant something.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.856
She was my mother.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.484
Then you read the case file.

36:35.152 --> 36:36.778
And it read like
many other case files.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.780
No logic to the crime.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.866
No reason. No answers.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.243
Yeah.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.329
When something important
in your life is unknown,

36:45.412 --> 36:48.582
it can lead to a feeling
of helplessness.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.044
You took a job in intelligence

36:52.169 --> 36:54.546
so you could take control
of your life with knowledge.

36:54.630 --> 36:57.132
But in this job,
the only real knowledge to be had

36:57.215 --> 37:00.552
is that most questions
never find a satisfying answer.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.846
But if you need to know
if your mother's death

37:02.930 --> 37:04.681
meant something more
than what it meant to you,

37:04.765 --> 37:06.683
I can tell you...

37:07.142 --> 37:10.270
Meera Malik was
a good woman and a fine agent.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.147
She saved lives.

37:13.065 --> 37:15.150
And her loss was immeasurable.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.498
Cynthia.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.001
I received a voicemail
message from Harold today

37:33.085 --> 37:36.922
that you have urgent business
to discuss with me.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.256
You missed my deadline.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.175
I did.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.427
But I'm here now.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.013
Doesn't matter.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.599
I can't cover for you
anymore, Raymond,

37:47.891 --> 37:50.769
waiting for your casual
disregard for human life

37:50.852 --> 37:54.481
to destroy my career
and the careers of others.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.150
I set a meeting with
the Attorney General tomorrow

37:57.234 --> 38:00.445
to tell him everything I know,
starting with your execution of Wujing

38:00.529 --> 38:03.240
and his associate Zhang Wei
inside the Post Office.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.909
I don't care what it'll cost me.

38:05.993 --> 38:08.245
And I know what it'll cost me.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.124
You must be referring to this.

38:12.541 --> 38:16.211
My casual disregard for humanity

38:16.294 --> 38:18.046
served you well enough
when you needed

38:18.130 --> 38:21.216
someone interrogated
to save a member of your family.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.844
I still have the recording,
of course.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.721
Send it to The New York Times.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.097
I don't care.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.474
I'm ready to pay for my mistakes.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.268
Do your worst.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.062
Cynthia, I'm trying to do my best.

38:37.941 --> 38:41.695
It's in nobody's interest
if you're only helping the task force

38:41.778 --> 38:43.905
because I'm forcing you to.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.659
Help them because the world
is a better place with them in it.

38:49.453 --> 38:53.040
Wujing and the Blacklisters
that he broke out of prison,

38:53.123 --> 38:55.417
that mess was created

38:55.500 --> 38:57.878
by my former associate,
Marvin Gerard.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.546
It was my mess to clean up.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.593
Anyway, that's my two cents.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.803
Spend it how you will.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.731
[door opens and closes]

39:17.814 --> 39:19.816
[phone clicks]

39:19.900 --> 39:22.152
[line ringing]

39:22.444 --> 39:26.907
Lorelei, cancel my meeting
with the Attorney General tomorrow.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.743
[phone clicks]

39:29.826 --> 39:31.536
[door opens]

39:35.499 --> 39:36.833
[keys jingle]

39:39.836 --> 39:43.757
The Barnes Foundation?
Where'd you get that?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.509
It's from Pinky.

39:48.512 --> 39:49.971
When did he give that to you?

39:50.138 --> 39:52.432
[chuckles] Pinky works
in mysterious ways.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.601
I-I was upstairs
and came down for a snack,

39:54.684 --> 39:57.979
and these were sitting on
the kitchen table with a note.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.191
You mind if I read the note?

40:07.239 --> 40:11.159
[Reddington] "Dear Agnes,
last we visited,

40:11.243 --> 40:15.205
I was so pleased to hear
your exciting stories

40:15.288 --> 40:20.168
about your field trip to
the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.546
But upon reflection,
I was a little disappointed

40:22.629 --> 40:25.799
that you didn't have a chance
to experience

40:25.882 --> 40:30.137
the amazing artworks
of the Barnes Foundation.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.596
So I rented a car yesterday

40:31.680 --> 40:34.141
and drove there to buy
a catalogue for you.

40:34.224 --> 40:36.518
Looks like Reddington's not here.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.353
He was here.

40:40.522 --> 40:42.858
[Reddington] I would've
gotten the catalogue to you sooner,

40:42.941 --> 40:46.236
but I ran into a little trouble
when I stopped on the way home

40:46.319 --> 40:50.407
to buy some world-famous
Goldenberg's Peanut Chews.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.244
Anyway, I wanted you to see

40:54.327 --> 40:58.832
how the Barnes Collection
integrates art and objects

40:58.915 --> 41:02.043
from across cultures
and time periods

41:02.127 --> 41:06.464
to reveal the universal impulse
to create wonder.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.760
The kind of wonder
that exists within each of us

41:10.844 --> 41:13.847
and makes life worth living.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.932
So enjoy the catalogue.

41:16.349 --> 41:19.728
Hopefully we can go
to the Barnes together one day.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.898
I love you. Pinky."

41:27.777 --> 41:29.905
Sweet of him. Right?

41:33.325 --> 41:34.576
Amazing.
