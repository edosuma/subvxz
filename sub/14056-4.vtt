00:00.232 --> 00:01.530
Previously, on The OC:

00:01.546 --> 00:03.745
What, are you saying you want to be social chair?

00:03.802 --> 00:04.694
Maybe.

00:04.797 --> 00:05.509
Don't move.

00:05.575 --> 00:06.503
I didn't steal anything.

00:06.564 --> 00:07.751
One month detention.

00:07.812 --> 00:09.603
Unless you want to give up your partner...

00:09.667 --> 00:11.598
They're reading Caleb's will on Friday.

00:11.654 --> 00:15.218
From what you told me about your dad, I'd bet he's planned a surprise for you.

00:15.275 --> 00:16.578
Caleb Nichol was broke.

00:16.799 --> 00:17.306
Broke?

00:17.367 --> 00:19.856
Ryan and I don't go to Harbor, but it'll be fine.

00:19.912 --> 00:21.110
At least you guys have each other.

00:21.166 --> 00:23.398
If you stick together, everything will be okay.

00:23.954 --> 00:24.751
- Deal?
- Deal.

00:34.498 --> 00:35.799
Newport Union.

00:35.872 --> 00:38.318
Orange County's answer to public education.

00:39.035 --> 00:40.898
Well, the parking lot looks spacious.

00:40.971 --> 00:42.265
Yeah, and well-lit.

00:42.338 --> 00:44.144
You know, at night, with all the lights.

00:44.217 --> 00:46.540
Plus, you're up on a hill; probably get a good breeze.

00:46.597 --> 00:48.942
That's important. A good breeze can make all the difference.

00:49.009 --> 00:51.544
Cohen, shut up about the breeze, okay? You're not helping.

00:51.610 --> 00:54.596
Oh, really? And you think the lights in the parking lot are making her feel better?

00:54.662 --> 00:56.218
Okay, look, guys, it's gonna be fine.

00:56.279 --> 00:57.749
You sure this is what you want, Coop?

00:57.794 --> 00:59.485
I don't really have a choice, Summ.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.358
I mean, even if I hadn't got kicked out of Harbor,

01:01.435 --> 01:03.509
my mom can't afford private school anymore.

01:03.519 --> 01:06.228
Well, I told you, you can always home school with me.

01:06.289 --> 01:07.093
I know.

01:07.170 --> 01:09.181
But I really think this is going to be fine.

01:09.326 --> 01:12.811
I mean, honestly, it's kind of nice to be somewhere where everybody doesn't know

01:12.931 --> 01:15.976
every little detail about your life and you don't have to be stared at all the time.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.154
I could see that.

01:19.443 --> 01:20.876
Okay, I'm going to go.

01:20.947 --> 01:22.337
All right. I'll pick you up this afternoon.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.435
Check out Newport Barbie.

01:52.007 --> 01:55.463
And that was the last they ever saw of her.

02:31.626 --> 02:34.206
Here you are, my little social chair maven.

02:34.344 --> 02:35.066
Thank you.

02:35.138 --> 02:37.847
Wait, don't put that there! That's the order for the caterer Saturday night.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.739
And that's my calculations for the streamers.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.109
You could put it there, though, on the contract for the DJ.

02:43.177 --> 02:45.736
I'm sure Dr. Bootyopolis wouldn't mind a little coffee.

02:48.045 --> 02:51.004
You know, I always thought that social chair was a ceremonial position,

02:51.035 --> 02:53.197
like Rose Bowl queen or president.

02:53.269 --> 02:54.875
How did Marissa do it all?

02:55.120 --> 02:55.902
Cohen...

02:56.774 --> 02:59.181
I took a little tour of the boys' locker room last night.

02:59.247 --> 03:02.145
I'm surprised the entire track team doesn't have trench foot.

03:02.498 --> 03:04.280
So I'll see you there at 3:00.

03:04.398 --> 03:06.948
Okay. You sure this is detention? It's got more of a...

03:07.608 --> 03:09.216
"work release" feel.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.343
Like I said,

03:10.455 --> 03:14.628
you give up the person who helped you steal the tiki hut, and this can go easier.

03:14.721 --> 03:15.851
On both of you.

03:16.002 --> 03:16.876
Sorry.

03:17.004 --> 03:18.069
It's just me.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.506
3:00.

03:20.171 --> 03:21.770
You'll start with the toilets.

03:24.707 --> 03:26.358
Dude, you've got to let me tell him.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.872
No way! Look, he's just upset, still, 'cause Ryan humiliated him at the carnival.

03:29.932 --> 03:31.095
This is my call.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.250
You plan the dance. Leave the toilets to me.

03:35.452 --> 03:37.366
I was hoping that'd sound more heroic.

03:37.403 --> 03:38.508
No, I got it, it's okay.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.508
Hey, there you are!

03:42.732 --> 03:44.544
Just got off the phone with your new tutor.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.901
She's got a great resume.

03:46.117 --> 03:47.371
Tutored Stallone's kids.

03:47.437 --> 03:50.888
Ah. Look, uh, I know this is kind of awkward timing, but

03:50.940 --> 03:52.957
what do you think about me going to Newport Union?

03:53.044 --> 03:54.258
Newport Union.

03:54.389 --> 03:55.266
With Marissa.

03:55.327 --> 03:59.124
A private tutor is really expensive, and it's not like I haven't been to public school in Chino.

03:59.183 --> 04:00.437
Ryan, Ryan.

04:00.509 --> 04:01.943
Look, she's going through a tough time.

04:02.005 --> 04:04.278
Caleb left them with nothing; her dad just took off.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.896
Neither of which is your responsibility.

04:05.963 --> 04:07.677
Okay, fine. Why do I need a reason?

04:07.703 --> 04:10.155
Because you need to focus on getting your life back on track.

04:10.232 --> 04:14.344
You need to start thinking about college and about S.A.T.'s, all right?

04:16.012 --> 04:16.797
All right.

04:17.005 --> 04:18.189
That's it, kid.

04:39.094 --> 04:41.075
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:41.321 --> 04:42.796
A little morning gardening.

04:42.877 --> 04:44.869
Oh, I thought I'd put in an herb garden.

04:44.956 --> 04:45.642
Wow!

04:45.709 --> 04:49.001
Dr. Woodrow says we should confront our fears, and mine is my cooking.

04:49.078 --> 04:50.245
So is mine.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.571
Well, we'll confront my cooking together.

04:52.653 --> 04:54.541
If that doesn't work, I'll buy dinner.

04:55.422 --> 04:56.676
I'm gonna take a shower.

04:59.763 --> 05:00.921
You know...

05:01.274 --> 05:02.959
You don't look so clean yourself.

05:03.030 --> 05:03.891
You think?

05:03.952 --> 05:04.545
No...

05:04.627 --> 05:05.964
I just showered.

05:16.496 --> 05:19.015
Did I tell you how glad I am you're back?

05:19.200 --> 05:21.596
Yeah, and I like hearing it.

05:27.141 --> 05:28.595
Julie Cooper Nichol?

05:28.743 --> 05:30.146
Yes? May I help you?

05:30.560 --> 05:34.959
You're here by notified that this house and its contents are being seized for repayment of debt.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.499
You have 48 hours to vacate the premises.

05:37.778 --> 05:38.661
I'm sorry.

06:01.963 --> 06:02.602
Oh!

06:03.062 --> 06:04.742
Oh, you did not just walk into me.

06:04.803 --> 06:05.940
Sorry, I wasn't looking.

06:06.012 --> 06:09.228
Was I supposed to just see you coming and step aside, princess?

06:09.663 --> 06:13.339
Uh, no, it's just it's my first day, and I don't know my way around yet.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.993
Fine. I'll let you go.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.663
Just tell me you think you're better than me.

06:17.036 --> 06:17.931
What?

06:18.024 --> 06:21.280
Tell me you think you're better than me, and I'll let you go.

06:21.725 --> 06:22.764
I don't.

06:22.826 --> 06:24.030
So now you're lying to me.

06:24.099 --> 06:25.592
So you think I'm stupid, too-- is that it?

06:25.658 --> 06:26.656
Hey, Heather.

06:27.138 --> 06:28.801
You welcoming a new student?

06:28.945 --> 06:30.654
I can take over if you want.

06:32.949 --> 06:33.819
Whatever.

06:36.225 --> 06:36.866
Thanks.

06:36.937 --> 06:38.745
I really don't know why she's got it in for me.

06:38.796 --> 06:40.219
My guess is the bag.

06:41.032 --> 06:42.211
And the shoes.

06:42.416 --> 06:45.632
And the Chanel necklace probably isn't helping either.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.321
But it's just a guess.

06:47.746 --> 06:49.999
Anyways... welcome to Newport Union.

06:50.408 --> 06:51.421
I'm Casey.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.010
Marissa Cooper.

06:53.188 --> 06:55.395
You're the first nice person I've actually met.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.003
And I'm not even that nice.

07:11.858 --> 07:12.843
Oop.

07:14.099 --> 07:17.437
Hey, Beth, that's supposed to be an octagon.

07:17.519 --> 07:19.331
Eight sides, not three.

07:30.482 --> 07:31.573
You need something?

07:32.069 --> 07:33.708
Hi, um...

07:34.230 --> 07:36.938
I thought I'd see if you needed any help with the dance.

07:37.019 --> 07:38.424
Mm. No.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.430
Okay, Summer, look...

07:41.299 --> 07:43.221
I know I can be a pain.

07:43.293 --> 07:47.077
A pain? Taylor, you staged a power play at the kickoff carnival.

07:47.159 --> 07:49.590
You tattled to the dean, and got Ryan kicked out of school.

07:49.646 --> 07:50.865
I don't have any friends.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.381
Well, geez, there's a shocker.

07:52.437 --> 07:53.907
I know, and it's my fault.

07:53.968 --> 07:57.465
I don't trust people, and so I try to control them,

07:57.520 --> 08:01.664
which then drives them away... ergo, no friends.

08:01.934 --> 08:03.947
I'm working through it with my therapist.

08:04.015 --> 08:05.127
Well, don't quit now.

08:05.212 --> 08:07.854
But I decided that this year was going to be different.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.807
And I thought if I was social chair, then people would like me,

08:10.873 --> 08:14.632
but I screwed that up, as usual.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.095
Okay, is this where I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?

08:17.182 --> 08:18.529
Okay, look...

08:19.026 --> 08:22.129
I'm sure people write prose poems in your yearbook

08:22.185 --> 08:24.508
about what an incredible friend you are.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.533
You know what I get?

08:25.605 --> 08:26.956
"Have a nice summer."

08:27.033 --> 08:29.589
But... it's my senior year.

08:29.753 --> 08:31.856
And I wanted more.

08:31.968 --> 08:34.472
I want someone to write,

08:35.030 --> 08:37.328
"I'm glad I finally got to know you."

08:42.283 --> 08:44.631
Go show Beth what an octagon is.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.954
Oh, God, she is a pinhead, isn't she?

08:50.657 --> 08:53.771
Yeah, see, that's the kind of thing I've got to keep in check.

09:02.609 --> 09:06.084
Either you're the worst thief ever, or it's your first day.

09:06.499 --> 09:08.521
I can't remember which locker is mine.

09:08.602 --> 09:11.097
Well, it probably isn't that one, 'cause that one is mine.

09:11.527 --> 09:12.899
Right. Sorry.

09:13.149 --> 09:13.882
It's all right.

09:13.948 --> 09:15.751
The vice principal has all the locker assignments.

09:15.807 --> 09:17.066
I can walk you over there, if you want.

09:17.134 --> 09:20.439
I got a lot of experience being sent to the vice principal's office.

09:20.707 --> 09:22.617
Thanks, but my boyfriend's gonna show up, so...

09:22.668 --> 09:24.162
You can throw your books in here if you want.

09:25.052 --> 09:25.980
Thanks.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.107
Hey, I'm Marissa.

09:27.174 --> 09:28.623
- Nice to meet you, I'm...
- Johnny!

09:29.165 --> 09:31.090
- Hey!
- Hey, Johnny!

09:31.520 --> 09:32.365
What's up?

09:35.191 --> 09:36.144
Sorry!

09:36.506 --> 09:37.628
I'm okay.

09:39.568 --> 09:41.099
This is Casey, my girlfriend.

09:41.182 --> 09:42.535
Oh, yeah. Actually, we've met.

09:42.606 --> 09:44.652
So, I see you survived your first day.

09:45.907 --> 09:46.802
Ow!

09:46.895 --> 09:48.355
I think I hurt something.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.012
And that's Dennis.

09:52.241 --> 09:53.265
Childress.

09:53.491 --> 09:55.247
Everyone calls me Chili.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.126
No one calls him Chili.

09:57.198 --> 09:58.652
Not if you keep telling people that!

09:58.703 --> 10:02.190
I'm trying to get a nickname, a handle... a hook.

10:02.256 --> 10:04.667
Hey, you want to come with us? We're gonna go get something to eat.

10:04.739 --> 10:06.853
Marissa's actually waiting for her boyfriend.

10:06.915 --> 10:10.499
Boyfriend? That's gonna be a problem for me, because I love you.

10:11.048 --> 10:12.737
I fall fast and hard.

10:13.186 --> 10:14.334
On a skateboard.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.496
Ha! Zing.

10:15.925 --> 10:18.128
Hey, what if we just gave you a ride home?

10:18.199 --> 10:21.169
Yeah. I mean, wouldn't you rather come to school tomorrow knowing a few people?

10:21.258 --> 10:23.954
Even if one of them is, um... Chili?

10:24.026 --> 10:26.791
Hey, the nickname's sticking.

10:27.537 --> 10:29.121
Come on, what do you say?

10:29.192 --> 10:30.336
Um...

10:31.107 --> 10:33.105
Yeah, okay, let me just make a call.

10:41.589 --> 10:42.320
Hey.

10:42.404 --> 10:45.095
Hey, it's me. I was gonna see if you'd left already.

10:45.173 --> 10:45.770
Uh...

10:45.838 --> 10:49.175
Because some people asked me to get food, and I know I should try and make friends.

10:49.247 --> 10:50.983
But if you've already left, then...

10:53.610 --> 10:54.322
Ryan?

10:54.419 --> 10:56.411
No, no, go ahead. I was just getting in the car.

10:56.476 --> 10:57.242
You sure?

10:57.326 --> 10:59.995
Yeah, yeah. Uh, just call me later, okay?

11:00.071 --> 11:02.038
Okay, bye.

11:03.799 --> 11:04.751
All right.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.727
Good morning. You have a second?

11:25.887 --> 11:28.253
Yeah. Sure. What's up?

11:28.330 --> 11:33.286
Uh... how would you like to, uh, stay with Summer for a few days?

11:33.532 --> 11:34.401
Sure.

11:34.622 --> 11:35.743
Any reason?

11:35.927 --> 11:37.765
Oh, it's such a mess.

11:37.832 --> 11:40.397
You see, I told Caleb's lawyer that we were thinking about moving.

11:40.448 --> 11:43.804
He thought that meant we already had a place, so he put this house on the market.

11:44.207 --> 11:45.972
We're getting kicked out, aren't we?

11:46.049 --> 11:47.467
No, of course not. It's just...

11:47.529 --> 11:49.562
Mom, Caleb was broke.

11:49.894 --> 11:51.712
It makes sense we'd have to sell everything.

11:51.804 --> 11:53.448
You know, you don't have to protect me.

11:54.411 --> 11:56.208
Well, then do you think it would be all right with Summer

11:56.254 --> 11:57.974
if you stayed until we got back on our feet?

11:58.031 --> 12:01.516
And we will get back on our feet and we'll be wearing very expensive shoes when we do.

12:01.814 --> 12:02.986
I trust you.

12:03.402 --> 12:04.347
You do?

12:04.953 --> 12:07.507
Yeah, I mean, I know we've had our differences, but if there's one thing

12:07.548 --> 12:09.497
I'll always say, it's you're a survivor.

12:09.661 --> 12:11.737
So if you say we'll make it, I believe you.

12:12.478 --> 12:14.542
Oh, honey, thank you.

12:15.285 --> 12:16.284
Sure.

12:17.425 --> 12:20.614
Besides, you must have saved a lot of money over the years, right?

12:21.690 --> 12:22.540
Of course.

12:24.383 --> 12:25.203
Hello.

12:25.939 --> 12:28.126
Hi. Uh, Kirsten Cohen?

12:28.275 --> 12:29.063
Uh, yeah.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.072
These are for you.

12:30.230 --> 12:31.157
Thank you.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.327
Thanks for letting me stay with you on such late notice.

12:46.393 --> 12:47.653
Oh, you know...

12:48.119 --> 12:49.486
I always wanted a sister.

12:49.564 --> 12:52.288
Cohen got Ryan as a brother, so it makes sense that I get you.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.715
Oh, God, Ryan.

12:53.787 --> 12:55.795
I was supposed to have breakfast with him this morning.

12:55.872 --> 12:56.876
I totally forgot.

12:56.982 --> 12:57.924
Ooh...

13:01.453 --> 13:02.252
Hey.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.304
I am a terrible girlfriend.

13:04.387 --> 13:05.016
No.

13:05.092 --> 13:08.626
Hey! This is my top. I knew you had it!

13:08.887 --> 13:10.058
You're with Summer?

13:10.127 --> 13:12.589
Yeah. My mom and I are getting kicked out of our house.

13:12.675 --> 13:13.443
What?!

13:13.521 --> 13:16.726
We found out this morning, which is why I had to pack up and move into Summer's.

13:16.924 --> 13:19.024
I just totally forgot about breakfast.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.486
It's fine. I mean, with everything you're going through,

13:21.527 --> 13:22.787
I don't want you worrying about me, too.

13:22.848 --> 13:24.027
Just, um...

13:24.591 --> 13:27.288
I don't know, I'll pick you up this afternoon. We'll do something then.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.767
Okay, thanks.

13:31.361 --> 13:33.590
What else of mine do you have in here?

13:35.030 --> 13:36.028
Hello?

13:36.110 --> 13:37.308
Kirsten, it's Charlotte.

13:37.364 --> 13:39.281
Oh, hey, Charlotte. How are you?

13:39.350 --> 13:43.294
Well, I am sitting here staring at the lake and wishing my friend was here to share it.

13:43.349 --> 13:45.971
Oh. Well, the flowers were beautiful. Thank you.

13:46.047 --> 13:47.487
Oh, I'm glad you liked them.

13:47.574 --> 13:49.023
Listen, I'm gonna be in the area tomorrow.

13:49.074 --> 13:52.120
I was hoping we could maybe meet-- lunch or coffee?

13:52.192 --> 13:53.626
Oh, lunch sounds great.

13:53.885 --> 13:56.605
Great. How about the Newport Bay Yacht Club?

13:56.671 --> 13:57.971
Sounds great. I'll see you tomorrow.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.237
Let's say 1:00?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.702
Perfect. Bye.

14:04.387 --> 14:05.390
Finally.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.575
She better come through with that money, though.

14:08.837 --> 14:10.311
Trust me, she will.

14:10.768 --> 14:12.303
And she loved her flowers.

14:13.404 --> 14:14.209
Right.

14:25.242 --> 14:26.004
Summer.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.637
Huh? Wait just a second.

14:27.710 --> 14:29.717
I was up all night going over the budget for the dance,

14:29.773 --> 14:31.897
and I don't know how the school expects us to...

14:32.003 --> 14:32.789
Come here.

14:33.014 --> 14:33.864
What are you doing?

14:34.141 --> 14:38.774
Okay, um, if I tell you this, you did not hear it from me, okay?

14:38.922 --> 14:40.259
I mean, this has to be secret.

14:40.311 --> 14:44.237
I mean, I'm talking Deep Throat before he went public to cash in on a fat book deal.

14:44.303 --> 14:45.559
What are you talking about?

14:46.798 --> 14:50.745
I was walking by the teachers' lounge, and I heard Dean Hess telling Dr. Kim

14:50.806 --> 14:53.402
that he knew Seth hadn't stolen the tiki hut alone.

14:53.471 --> 14:55.409
Which, by the way, I totally forgive him for.

14:55.465 --> 14:56.070
Taylor...

14:56.136 --> 15:01.594
Okay. But... if Seth didn't tell him by the end of the day who the other person was,

15:01.865 --> 15:03.489
he was gonna suspend him.

15:04.206 --> 15:06.673
Oh, my God, are you serious?

15:06.833 --> 15:07.861
What's the matter?

15:08.348 --> 15:10.273
Oh. Hey.

15:10.379 --> 15:12.771
Taylor was just telling me that, um...

15:13.227 --> 15:15.572
Dr. Bootyopolis was found on a pedophile Web site.

15:15.636 --> 15:16.863
We have got to replace him.

15:16.929 --> 15:18.295
Taylor, you know, good job.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.543
Yeah, no problem. Um, I'll see you later.

15:20.605 --> 15:21.583
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.259
I still can't believe you're letting her help with the dance.

15:25.561 --> 15:27.026
You know, she's not so bad.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.740
A pedophile Web site?

15:29.180 --> 15:30.840
What was she doing on it?

15:35.299 --> 15:37.410
Oh! Just give me a few minutes.

15:37.517 --> 15:38.714
The quiche is almost ready.

15:38.782 --> 15:40.456
The quiche? For lunch?

15:40.512 --> 15:42.841
Wow. I could get used to this.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.523
Is everything okay?

15:46.609 --> 15:48.248
Yeah, yeah.

15:49.804 --> 15:52.058
Listen, I put this off as long as possible,

15:52.129 --> 15:55.484
but we really have to make a decision about the Newport Group.

15:56.235 --> 15:57.377
Okay.

15:57.817 --> 15:59.159
What's the situation?

15:59.282 --> 16:01.495
Well, I've done my best to stay on top of things,

16:01.556 --> 16:05.564
but Caleb's financial troubles have left a huge hole in the company.

16:05.642 --> 16:08.012
Pretty soon, all that will be left is the name.

16:08.094 --> 16:10.177
How long before we default on our loans?

16:10.275 --> 16:11.432
Six weeks.

16:11.521 --> 16:14.136
It's not too late to rescue it, if that's what you want.

16:14.197 --> 16:17.402
We could sell off some assets, restructure the debt.

16:17.468 --> 16:18.708
Option two?

16:18.820 --> 16:20.392
Sell everything and walk away.

16:20.459 --> 16:22.280
I'm behind you either way.

16:22.337 --> 16:25.568
And just so you know, this family is fine financially.

16:25.631 --> 16:29.794
So don't make this decision thinking that we need your income; we don't.

16:32.118 --> 16:33.597
It's time to let it go.

16:35.426 --> 16:36.941
I'll handle everything.

16:45.661 --> 16:46.545
Come in.

16:48.983 --> 16:50.003
Dean Hess?

16:53.310 --> 16:54.114
Hi.

16:55.996 --> 16:57.702
Look, I...

16:58.071 --> 17:01.445
I helped Seth steal that tiki hut. Or borrow it. Whatever.

17:01.768 --> 17:03.560
I had a feeling you might have helped out.

17:03.602 --> 17:05.537
Helped out? Please. I did all the work.

17:05.587 --> 17:08.040
Old noodle arms, he couldn't even lift a palm tree leaf without...

17:09.532 --> 17:12.069
Anyway, that's the truth.

17:12.162 --> 17:15.192
You know, Summer, with this on your record,

17:15.464 --> 17:19.641
I can't very well allow you to remain as social chair.

17:19.877 --> 17:23.277
Wait, look. Please? I really have grown to love that job.

17:26.881 --> 17:31.397
Wait a second, who would replace me? Um, Taylor?

17:31.611 --> 17:35.412
Hm. Well, Taylor's pretty qualified for the position.

17:35.499 --> 17:37.715
I'll let her know you suggested her.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.457
I'm such an idiot!

17:43.619 --> 17:46.092
You were never gonna suspend Seth, were you?

17:46.184 --> 17:48.058
You're late for class, Summer.

17:50.925 --> 17:51.827
Sandy?

17:52.037 --> 17:54.264
Julie! Have a seat.

17:54.386 --> 17:55.406
What can I do for you?

17:55.493 --> 17:57.904
Oh, it's such a small thing, really.

17:57.970 --> 17:58.793
Just...

17:59.538 --> 18:02.881
What exactly are the rules about loans to company officers?

18:02.959 --> 18:05.431
In this case, former officers.

18:05.506 --> 18:07.381
So you want a loan from the Newport Group?

18:07.637 --> 18:10.730
I could pay it back within a year, tops, two outside.

18:10.832 --> 18:14.202
Well, first off, you can't take personal loans from a company.

18:14.251 --> 18:15.669
People go to jail for that.

18:15.756 --> 18:20.774
And secondly, in a few weeks, there isn't gonna be a Newport Group anymore.

18:21.958 --> 18:22.715
What?

18:22.793 --> 18:24.886
Yeah, Kirsten's not coming back to work.

18:25.025 --> 18:26.724
So we're gonna liquidate the company.

18:27.973 --> 18:32.675
Wow, it's-it's, uh, it's all really ending, hm?

18:33.841 --> 18:36.084
Hey, forgive me for asking, but, uh...

18:38.112 --> 18:39.713
where do you stand financially?

18:39.775 --> 18:40.953
'Cause Kirsten and I could lend you...

18:41.025 --> 18:42.746
No, no. Um...

18:43.256 --> 18:44.978
The loan was just for convenience, really.

18:45.049 --> 18:47.021
I-I'm looking to put a down payment on a house.

18:47.091 --> 18:49.262
I found this really great place on the beach.

18:49.458 --> 18:52.289
I'll just sell some stock, you know? I have too much anyway.

18:53.284 --> 18:55.239
Uh, you get back to your liquidating.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.422
Please tell Kirsten I'll stop by soon, I promise.

18:58.545 --> 18:59.309
Sure.

19:08.192 --> 19:08.893
Summer.

19:08.961 --> 19:12.755
No. Just so you know, you and your friend, the dean, may have won this round,

19:12.810 --> 19:14.971
but the war is not over.

19:16.059 --> 19:21.042
Well, unless you have an exit strategy, don't even get out of the boat.

19:21.217 --> 19:23.701
I am a human quagmire.

19:25.744 --> 19:26.926
What's a quagmire?

19:29.296 --> 19:31.120
Hello? Anyone?

19:31.601 --> 19:32.456
Quagmire?

19:40.025 --> 19:41.114
You thinking of going?

19:42.906 --> 19:45.195
Oh, well, I don't know. Does it have a theme?

19:46.204 --> 19:46.925
Theme?

19:47.119 --> 19:50.232
Yeah, like, uh, "Winter Wonderland" or "Under the Sea."

19:50.713 --> 19:56.289
I think the theme is school gym, bag of pretzels and Chili spikes the punch.

19:56.397 --> 19:58.194
It's pretty much the same theme every year.

19:58.286 --> 19:59.806
Right. I don't think I'll be going, then.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.335
Not because it doesn't have a theme. Just...

20:02.403 --> 20:05.321
No, look, I know I made it sound like not much fun--

20:05.808 --> 20:08.521
'cause it isn't-- but you should go, really.

20:08.705 --> 20:10.207
Dennis and Casey and I are going.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.268
We'll all not have fun together.

20:12.357 --> 20:13.236
Excuse me.

20:13.898 --> 20:17.128
Hey, uh, I just wanted to apologize about yesterday.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.863
I-I was acting like a jerk.

20:19.144 --> 20:20.215
Don't worry about it.

20:20.563 --> 20:22.873
So then you're not gonna shoot me?

20:25.715 --> 20:28.336
I mean, isn't that why you got kicked out of that private school--

20:28.504 --> 20:29.722
'cause you shot someone?

20:39.463 --> 20:40.276
Marissa.

20:41.756 --> 20:42.892
Don't listen to her.

20:43.429 --> 20:45.032
Why? She was right.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.135
That's why I'm here, and now everyone's gonna know.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.881
Yeah, well, everyone already kind of knew.

20:53.792 --> 20:57.965
I just thought, if I came here, maybe I might get a second chance.

21:00.052 --> 21:03.245
Look... I saw the news.

21:04.171 --> 21:06.352
You know, you did what you had to do.

21:07.877 --> 21:09.993
They said you saved someone's life that night.

21:11.323 --> 21:12.936
Not a lot of people would do that.

21:15.533 --> 21:16.290
Hm?

21:27.943 --> 21:29.069
Come on, let's go find Casey.

21:29.249 --> 21:30.079
What's going on?

21:30.856 --> 21:31.614
Ryan.

21:31.854 --> 21:33.810
Hey. What's wrong? What'd you do to her?

21:33.908 --> 21:35.311
Nothing. I'm fine.

21:36.237 --> 21:38.584
- This is my...
- Boyfriend, I'm guessing. Hey.

21:47.789 --> 21:48.756
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.287
- Johnny...
- No, it's cool.

21:54.311 --> 21:56.134
He was just trying to be nice.

22:01.479 --> 22:04.249
Hey, Dead or Alive is playing at the Lido.

22:04.316 --> 22:07.393
You, me, Yakuza Bloodbath. We're there.

22:07.476 --> 22:09.093
Uh... yeah, I can't.

22:09.201 --> 22:11.894
Miss Reed really loaded me up with a lot of work, so...

22:11.996 --> 22:14.741
Not buying it. Looks like we've got an emotional thing going on.

22:15.155 --> 22:20.253
All right, come on, buddy. Get ready for a little old-fashioned Seth-Ryan time.

22:20.332 --> 22:24.135
All right, fine. Uh... So, yesterday, I went to pick up Marissa at school.

22:24.197 --> 22:26.465
Ah. Marissa. Didn't see that one coming.

22:27.059 --> 22:28.371
- Continue.
- Thanks.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.780
And I thought I saw this guy...

22:31.462 --> 22:33.833
I... I misjudged the situation.

22:33.986 --> 22:37.944
And, uh... I overreacted and...

22:38.209 --> 22:40.869
I might have, maybe, embarrassed her.

22:43.556 --> 22:44.666
I embarrassed her.

22:45.005 --> 22:46.745
Now you're tearing yourself apart,

22:46.960 --> 22:49.792
wondering if you not only damaged her standing at a new school,

22:49.863 --> 22:51.717
but perhaps also your relationship.

22:51.785 --> 22:52.450
More or less.

22:52.482 --> 22:53.606
Well, that is a pickle.

22:55.434 --> 22:56.557
That's it? No advice?

22:56.632 --> 23:00.170
What advice? Call her. Apologize. It's not rocket science.

23:00.381 --> 23:03.335
Man, you home-school kids are pathetic.

23:06.439 --> 23:08.082
Why aren't you going to the dance?

23:08.281 --> 23:09.699
Gee, I don't know.

23:09.767 --> 23:12.121
Maybe because, in one day, I went from being the girl no one knows

23:12.168 --> 23:13.704
to the girl who shot someone.

23:13.765 --> 23:15.813
I thought you said the surfer guy was cool about it.

23:15.875 --> 23:18.019
- Yeah, he was, but...
- But nothing.

23:18.085 --> 23:20.160
Why don't you call him and just tell him that you're going to go?

23:20.221 --> 23:21.429
Well, what about Ryan?

23:21.907 --> 23:24.062
I mean, he looked like he wanted to kill Johnny.

23:24.128 --> 23:25.643
It's not like I'd go without him.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.882
Well, you have to.

23:26.979 --> 23:29.094
Harsh, I know. But you know what?

23:29.145 --> 23:31.245
You're at a new school, and there is a dance.

23:31.307 --> 23:33.581
It's like Social Survival 101.

23:36.063 --> 23:36.867
It's Ryan.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.903
Okay, time to go mystic. I need to even out.

23:41.162 --> 23:41.996
Hey.

23:42.151 --> 23:44.255
Hey. How you doing?

23:44.336 --> 23:45.187
Good.

23:45.448 --> 23:48.750
Good. Listen, um... about yesterday...

23:48.817 --> 23:51.294
It was my fault. You know, I was just upset.

23:51.510 --> 23:52.995
Your reaction was normal.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.989
Okay. Uh...

23:57.475 --> 24:00.246
So you want to go to the movies later tonight?

24:00.306 --> 24:03.542
I could, um... beat up the usher, get us some free Milk Duds.

24:03.748 --> 24:06.582
Actually, I was thinking of doing my homework.

24:06.948 --> 24:09.794
It's just it's the first week, and I want to make a good impression.

24:09.855 --> 24:10.568
Sure.

24:13.015 --> 24:14.667
But I'll probably need a break.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.625
So, uh... we'll talk later, okay?

24:16.778 --> 24:18.411
Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.

24:30.654 --> 24:31.400
Hey, you.

24:31.651 --> 24:33.213
Oh, hey!

24:34.463 --> 24:36.812
- It's great to see you.
- Oh, you, too.

24:36.895 --> 24:39.403
- You look amazing.
- Oh, thank you. So do you.

24:39.474 --> 24:41.738
Oh, it was all that time at my dad's.

24:41.804 --> 24:43.238
That was such a wonderful place.

24:43.345 --> 24:44.548
How lucky were we?

24:44.631 --> 24:46.904
I mean, to be able to go someplace so peaceful.

24:46.981 --> 24:49.166
You're right. It's a shame everyone can't stay there.

24:50.542 --> 24:55.014
Well, what if there was a place, like the lake house,

24:55.081 --> 24:58.015
where women could go between rehab and the real world?

24:58.199 --> 25:00.175
That would be amazing.

25:00.252 --> 25:02.417
Yeah. That's what some investor friends of mine thought, too.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.031
See, I pitched the idea to a few people.

25:04.113 --> 25:06.529
I even started looking at properties. I'm thinking Sedona.

25:06.692 --> 25:10.707
And then I realized Kirsten has to be a part of this.

25:10.994 --> 25:12.212
You mean invest?

25:12.269 --> 25:13.995
Oh, it would just be a couple million to start.

25:14.066 --> 25:17.850
I'll be assuming most of the risk, and you'd get it all back within the first few years.

25:18.864 --> 25:21.992
Well, I'm flattered, but I don't have that kind of money.

25:22.016 --> 25:24.025
Oh, please. Don't be so modest.

25:24.418 --> 25:25.883
I wish I was.

25:26.041 --> 25:28.376
When my father died, he left nothing.

25:32.283 --> 25:35.401
Really? I... I just assumed...

25:36.676 --> 25:39.538
I mean, after you went to the reading of the will, everything was great.

25:39.555 --> 25:40.757
Everything is.

25:40.935 --> 25:43.854
Things with Sandy and my kids have never been better.

25:44.673 --> 25:48.258
Well, that is so wonderful that you've got your priorities in place.

25:52.814 --> 25:55.549
So what about the Newport Group as a silent partner?

25:56.004 --> 25:57.130
I'm selling it.

25:57.407 --> 26:00.709
It's riddled with debt and unpaid loans, and I just figured...

26:00.771 --> 26:03.919
Better to rid yourself of every last vestige of your dad.

26:03.976 --> 26:06.141
Well, I don't know if I'd put it that way.

26:06.223 --> 26:07.571
It's classic, Kirsten.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.423
You're hoping that, by closing up shop, all your issues with your dad will just disappear.

26:12.516 --> 26:14.452
- It's not like that.
- I've been there.

26:15.705 --> 26:18.607
I think it's... it's so great that you're trying to put the past behind you.

26:18.650 --> 26:21.372
It's just not that easy.

26:22.234 --> 26:24.451
I'm sorry. I just... I don't want you to be disappointed

26:24.517 --> 26:27.815
when the issues remain even after the company's sold.

26:29.590 --> 26:32.996
Anyway, invest or not, you are welcome anytime.

26:33.068 --> 26:34.488
Sedona's beautiful.

26:35.756 --> 26:36.964
So what's good here?

26:41.890 --> 26:43.010
Oh, no. Not you again.

26:43.093 --> 26:43.809
Hey!

26:44.235 --> 26:47.246
Mrs. Nichol, please don't make this more difficult than it has to be.

26:47.312 --> 26:50.071
More difficult? Who are they? What are they doing?

26:50.149 --> 26:54.218
If you haven't already done so, I suggest you take this time to pack your personal belongings.

26:54.301 --> 26:57.246
The deputy is here to see you don't interfere with the movers.

26:58.976 --> 27:00.287
Oh, my God!

27:05.324 --> 27:07.269
Sum, your door!

27:11.069 --> 27:11.968
Summer!

27:19.486 --> 27:20.295
Surprise.

27:20.398 --> 27:22.349
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

27:22.369 --> 27:23.971
We came to take you to the school dance.

27:24.216 --> 27:26.281
Oh, thanks, but I'm not going.

27:26.363 --> 27:28.169
You could be my date, Marissa!

27:28.256 --> 27:29.681
Way to bait the hook, Dennis.

27:29.906 --> 27:31.662
It's a school dance. You got to go.

27:31.862 --> 27:33.653
If you don't show up, people might start to talk.

27:33.715 --> 27:35.230
You'd hate for that to happen, right?

27:35.342 --> 27:38.962
Besides, since we're not leaving without you, you'd be ruining our night, too.

27:44.406 --> 27:45.132
Yo!

27:45.378 --> 27:47.314
Hey. Stocking the larder?

27:47.391 --> 27:49.872
Your mom's making me lamb ragu. It's French.

27:50.094 --> 27:51.364
Now, where you headed?

27:51.651 --> 27:52.696
Where are you heading?

27:52.717 --> 27:54.272
Uh... a dance. There's a beach thing.

27:54.350 --> 27:57.595
I'm going to drop in on Marissa, see if she needs a study break. Maybe grab a bite.

27:57.683 --> 27:59.043
Well, you're welcome to join us.

27:59.126 --> 28:00.161
You two have fun.

28:00.922 --> 28:01.900
Enjoy.

28:04.497 --> 28:08.798
Honey, I've got everything on the list, including a little Chunky Monkey, but that's mostly for me.

28:08.865 --> 28:10.672
All right, it's all for me.

28:11.957 --> 28:12.914
Thanks, sweetie.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.177
Is everything okay?

28:15.961 --> 28:18.295
Listen, if you're not up to cooking, we can order in.

28:18.444 --> 28:19.596
It's a lot safer.

28:20.062 --> 28:21.444
No, no. It's just...

28:22.719 --> 28:25.556
I'm doing the right thing, closing down the Newport Group.

28:25.730 --> 28:27.040
I'm not hiding, right?

28:27.117 --> 28:29.232
Hiding? No.

28:29.283 --> 28:30.921
You're putting the past behind you.

28:32.928 --> 28:33.906
What is it?

28:35.218 --> 28:36.102
Nothing.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.651
We forgot the oregano.

28:39.784 --> 28:40.912
I'll be right back.

28:42.529 --> 28:43.861
You never mentioned oregano.

28:43.936 --> 28:45.929
I forgot. I'll be back soon.

28:48.837 --> 28:50.378
- Whoo!
- All right, here we go.

28:50.485 --> 28:51.975
Oh, check you out, girl.

29:01.888 --> 29:03.382
I thought Marissa was studying.

29:03.453 --> 29:04.549
So did I.

29:04.659 --> 29:07.166
See? That's the problem with the surprise pop-in.

29:09.112 --> 29:10.340
Ryan, hey!

29:11.570 --> 29:15.061
- He looks kind of mad.
- Yeah. I think that's his look.

29:15.138 --> 29:18.391
I'm going to go get Summer before things get awkward.

29:19.904 --> 29:21.262
I thought you were studying tonight.

29:21.338 --> 29:23.407
- I was.
- Andale! Arriba! Arriba!

29:23.730 --> 29:24.661
Your lab partner?

29:24.753 --> 29:27.021
There's this dance tonight at Newport Union.

29:27.491 --> 29:29.084
I was going to tell you. I just didn't...

29:29.167 --> 29:30.867
Is this about yesterday?

29:31.220 --> 29:32.464
No. I swear.

29:33.550 --> 29:37.962
Hey, look, I wish I didn't have to go to this. It's just being there every day, alone...

29:38.029 --> 29:40.251
I mean, I really need these friends, Ryan.

29:47.159 --> 29:48.418
You're right. You should go.

30:11.817 --> 30:12.672
You okay?

30:12.846 --> 30:13.825
Fine. Have fun.

30:15.287 --> 30:17.791
Hey, man, sorry about all of the confusion.

30:18.165 --> 30:20.155
A little heads-up would have been great, woman.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.026
Don't you worry. I'm going to take care of her.

30:22.032 --> 30:23.286
Sure. See ya.

30:57.129 --> 30:59.136
Time to add a little flavor to the punch.

30:59.230 --> 31:00.544
Get this party started.

31:01.793 --> 31:04.702
Now it's officially a school dance.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.278
Um... hey, you know what? Just... excuse me.

31:40.608 --> 31:41.784
Marissa, wait.

31:41.853 --> 31:43.347
What am I supposed to do?

31:43.440 --> 31:44.873
They're all staring at me.

31:44.955 --> 31:48.053
That is exactly when you get in there, you throw down a little cardboard,

31:48.104 --> 31:49.615
and you make it happen, you know?

31:49.687 --> 31:51.478
Cut a little rug. That's what I'd do.

31:51.571 --> 31:53.004
Yeah, but I'm not you.

31:53.096 --> 31:55.098
Yeah, you've got that to be thankful for.

31:55.620 --> 31:58.273
A... a little hurtful, but a good point.

31:58.361 --> 32:03.007
Look, public-school kids-- all kids, really--

32:03.439 --> 32:04.743
they're like dogs.

32:05.230 --> 32:06.715
They smell fear.

32:07.033 --> 32:09.895
And they like Frisbees.

32:10.735 --> 32:13.853
You just got to go back in there and act like they're not looking at you.

32:15.113 --> 32:16.622
Come on. What do you say?

32:16.690 --> 32:17.489
Come on.

32:20.483 --> 32:21.098
Come on.

32:21.529 --> 32:23.750
To make you feel better, I'll show you a couple of moves.

32:24.073 --> 32:28.284
I'm just worrying about Ryan. I feel like he's feeling left out.

32:28.293 --> 32:29.120
Yeah.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.793
Well, do you like it?

32:38.916 --> 32:41.420
I know it's not like Marissa's dances, but...

32:41.492 --> 32:43.579
Summer, it's incredible.

32:43.678 --> 32:44.260
Yeah?

32:44.323 --> 32:46.555
It's like you brought the ocean to us.

32:46.734 --> 32:48.295
You're my little human tsunami.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.170
Thanks.

32:49.298 --> 32:50.998
Hi, everybody.

32:51.188 --> 32:52.771
Everyone, hi.

32:52.853 --> 32:55.613
I'm Taylor Townsend, your social chair,

32:55.695 --> 32:58.248
and I would like to thank you all for coming.

33:00.482 --> 33:02.177
Relax, she's not taking credit for it.

33:02.253 --> 33:03.267
Thank you.

33:03.528 --> 33:07.317
So this dance has been my baby now for quite a while.

33:07.577 --> 33:09.489
Okay, she's taking credit for it.

33:09.549 --> 33:10.833
I am going to kill her.

33:10.907 --> 33:15.990
But there is one person without whose help none of this could ever have happened.

33:16.056 --> 33:17.741
- See, she's gonna...
- Dean Hess.

33:17.813 --> 33:18.597
Oh.

33:23.381 --> 33:24.243
Thank you.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.558
I'm going to kill the both of them.

33:26.819 --> 33:27.515
Wait.

33:27.619 --> 33:32.763
So everyone have fun because this really is "The End of Summer."

33:35.420 --> 33:37.444
You kind of set yourself up for that one.

33:41.877 --> 33:42.737
I knew it.

33:42.809 --> 33:44.805
Okay, from the beginning, I knew this plan was crap.

33:44.871 --> 33:47.365
Spending 30 grand to go to rehab just to find a mark?

33:47.427 --> 33:48.196
It made sense.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.315
Every woman there was vulnerable and rich.

33:50.387 --> 33:51.810
Yeah, except the one you picked out.

33:51.870 --> 33:53.387
I mean, what the hell we supposed to do now?

33:53.449 --> 33:57.110
This woman is the princess of Orange County, okay?

33:57.176 --> 34:00.283
I... I will find a way to use her.

34:02.889 --> 34:03.749
Okay?

34:04.015 --> 34:06.740
I'm not going to let Kirsten Cohen get away.

34:34.987 --> 34:37.690
I didn't know you kept the oregano stashed in here.

34:37.772 --> 34:38.597
Hey.

34:38.949 --> 34:39.538
Hey.

34:40.485 --> 34:41.585
Recognize this?

34:41.822 --> 34:42.657
Sure.

34:43.266 --> 34:45.059
It's the Roth building on Ocean.

34:45.453 --> 34:47.475
Built in 1922.

34:47.766 --> 34:49.277
It was gonna be torn down,

34:49.775 --> 34:52.199
and I convinced my father to restore it.

34:52.266 --> 34:53.505
It was my first project.

34:57.045 --> 35:01.248
All those years, he was right on the other side of that wall,

35:01.264 --> 35:03.357
and no matter how hard I worked,

35:03.781 --> 35:05.528
I was never gonna reach him.

35:05.799 --> 35:08.630
Honey, we can keep the company.

35:09.987 --> 35:10.889
No.

35:13.294 --> 35:15.236
I just needed to say good-bye.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.211
I guess it's too late for dinner.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.757
How do you feel about a picnic?

35:26.981 --> 35:27.831
Oh!

35:34.605 --> 35:35.518
Hey, man.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.939
Hey, man, I just wanted to see how you were doing.

35:38.051 --> 35:39.369
I'm great. How's the dance?

35:39.449 --> 35:40.979
Uh, good.

35:41.067 --> 35:43.693
I sent Summer for a cool-down lap around the building.

35:43.760 --> 35:49.070
Listen, I just wanted to make sure you're not taking this Marissa thing too seriously.

35:49.192 --> 35:50.927
Seth, it's fine, I get it.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.698
Yeah, okay.

35:53.134 --> 35:56.871
I just want to make sure you don't think she's pulling away, or, you know,

35:56.948 --> 36:00.395
you're going to look back on tonight and say "This is when I started losing her.

36:00.477 --> 36:01.830
I should have done something."

36:02.899 --> 36:05.503
Because I'm here to tell you that that's not going to happen.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.639
I'm talking, like, zero chance.

36:08.059 --> 36:08.837
Right.

36:10.291 --> 36:13.646
Okay. Well, I just, I wanted to make sure you knew that.

36:16.610 --> 36:18.299
Yeah, look, I got to go.

36:18.448 --> 36:19.927
Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later.

36:26.648 --> 36:27.648
Can I get a check?

36:57.099 --> 36:57.933
Ryan!

36:59.048 --> 37:01.155
- Hey. 
- Seth, what are you doing here?

37:01.220 --> 37:02.393
I'm here to stop you, man.

37:02.465 --> 37:04.805
And if that means throwing myself between you and the gym,

37:04.901 --> 37:07.012
I'm only gonna ask that you spare my face.

37:07.087 --> 37:07.952
It's okay.

37:09.205 --> 37:10.723
You're not gonna rush in?

37:14.850 --> 37:15.868
It'd just ruin it.

37:18.598 --> 37:20.830
You're doing the right thing, man. You're not gonna lose her.

37:21.727 --> 37:24.400
Will you give me a ride? My left leg's really tired.

37:31.071 --> 37:33.707
This is Seth, it's 2005, you know how these things work.

37:34.716 --> 37:39.287
Cohizzle, where are you? You said you'd only be gone, like, ten minutes.

38:40.877 --> 38:41.921
Oh, my God.

39:59.403 --> 40:01.983
Summer, hey, sorry. Ryan, he needed...

40:02.050 --> 40:04.559
Seth, shut up. There's something really important I have to tell you.

40:05.502 --> 40:06.289
Summer...

40:08.825 --> 40:10.149
Enjoying the dance?

40:12.834 --> 40:15.106
- What's so important?
- Oh, nothing. Just dance with me.

40:17.625 --> 40:18.414
What?

40:19.473 --> 40:20.170
What?

40:28.019 --> 40:28.701
Hey.

40:30.860 --> 40:31.725
Hey.

40:33.215 --> 40:37.608
So I just wanted to tell you how important it was for me to go to the school dance.

40:37.625 --> 40:38.427
I know.

40:38.637 --> 40:42.759
But I spent the whole time wishing you were there.

40:44.152 --> 40:46.334
My life just doesn't work without you.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.052
And it always goes so smooth when we're together.

40:52.150 --> 40:52.850
Thanks.

40:54.648 --> 40:56.783
- So I'll make you a deal.
- Yeah?

40:56.917 --> 40:59.942
Whatever song comes on the radio next will be our song, okay?

41:01.238 --> 41:02.241
Okay.

41:06.538 --> 41:08.667
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I like it.

41:08.743 --> 41:09.702
It's definitely us.

41:10.031 --> 41:11.007
No.

41:14.628 --> 41:15.641
Hey.

42:50.558 --> 42:55.374
