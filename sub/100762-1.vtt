WEBVTT

02:25.763 --> 02:27.865
God.

04:19.576 --> 04:21.076
Shit!

04:21.078 --> 04:23.746
Who are you and why did you
bring me here?

04:23.748 --> 04:25.848
Fuck. Bring you here?
Lady,

04:25.850 --> 04:27.249
I just woke up.

04:27.251 --> 04:29.617
Look. Look.

04:29.619 --> 04:31.086
I was drugged.

04:31.088 --> 04:33.923
Some arsehole
stuck me last night.

04:33.925 --> 04:36.524
Come on. See, please.
Come on.

04:46.237 --> 04:48.037
Is that where you woke up?

04:48.039 --> 04:49.572
Yeah. You?

04:50.074 --> 04:51.807
Next door.

04:51.809 --> 04:52.944
A bunch of rooms out there.

04:53.978 --> 04:55.146
Is it just us?

04:56.714 --> 04:58.581
The first door I tried.

05:00.051 --> 05:02.751
What's the last thing
you remember?

05:02.753 --> 05:04.221
Gorgeous brunette
at the end of the bar.

05:04.655 --> 05:06.221
- Ah.
- What?

05:06.223 --> 05:07.858
Just because I'm Irish,
you think I'm a drunk?

05:09.592 --> 05:10.995
I was having
a fuckin' ginger ale.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.231
What about you?

05:15.933 --> 05:17.600
I, uh, don't exactly remember.

05:18.769 --> 05:20.869
Don't remember?

05:20.871 --> 05:24.572
Well, forgive me
if that doesn't do it for me.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.744
Because when it comes to
a syringe in my neck,

05:27.577 --> 05:29.080
I tend to be specific.

05:31.849 --> 05:33.017
Now you're my new best friend.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.885
Oh, we're not friends.

05:38.322 --> 05:41.190
Come on, give us a chance, yeah?

05:41.192 --> 05:43.593
We'll be as thick as thieves
in no time.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.001
I'm holding you responsible

05:52.003 --> 05:54.205
for whoever's going
down with you. Hmm?

05:55.306 --> 05:56.674
Right then.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.541
After you.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.728
Stop.

06:20.364 --> 06:23.198
Relax. We're locked in here too.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.900
I don't believe you.

06:24.902 --> 06:26.137
You got one of these?

06:28.739 --> 06:30.973
I said stop.

06:30.975 --> 06:33.842
If you're trying to cut through,
it won't work.

06:33.844 --> 06:36.779
- No shit.
- That thing burns hotter than lava.

06:36.781 --> 06:38.147
You'll start melting the metal,

06:38.149 --> 06:39.649
and you'll be burning
the whole place down.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.584
How do you know?

06:42.653 --> 06:44.353
My father's in the trade.

06:44.355 --> 06:46.021
What trade?

06:46.023 --> 06:47.590
Contracting.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.267
Just coming over here.

07:00.271 --> 07:01.705
What's on the other side
of this door?

07:02.773 --> 07:04.275
A way out I was hoping.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.579
You.

07:10.748 --> 07:11.949
What's your name?

07:12.649 --> 07:14.316
Kate.

07:14.318 --> 07:16.120
I'm Rowan,
if anyone gives a shit.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.801
We're here for a reason.

07:57.328 --> 07:58.662
What is that?

07:59.096 --> 08:00.231
A reason.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.232
They're plans to a vault

08:03.234 --> 08:05.300
inside the Matheson Museum.

08:05.302 --> 08:06.835
- The what?
- It's...

08:06.837 --> 08:08.337
It's in Cleveland.

08:08.339 --> 08:09.907
Are we supposed to go
to Cleveland?

08:12.843 --> 08:13.944
Wait...

08:14.745 --> 08:16.979
are we in Cleveland?

08:16.981 --> 08:20.082
What in the name of Jesus
are we doing in Cleveland?

08:20.084 --> 08:22.184
- Where were you last?
- New York.

08:22.186 --> 08:24.319
Arizona. You?

08:24.321 --> 08:26.190
Toronto. Vacation.

08:39.870 --> 08:42.504
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to bring us here.

08:42.506 --> 08:45.274
So, whatever the score is,
it's gotta be worth it.

08:45.276 --> 08:46.975
Score, huh?

08:46.977 --> 08:48.477
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:48.479 --> 08:50.381
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

08:50.881 --> 08:52.750
Contracting, right?

08:53.217 --> 08:54.351
That's the one.

08:59.223 --> 09:01.158
But if this were a score,

09:02.393 --> 09:04.795
- what would it be?
- I don't know.

09:27.384 --> 09:30.287
Great. Reality TV.

09:33.857 --> 09:36.193
Kiss my bollocks, big brother!

09:45.569 --> 09:47.137
High explosive.

09:48.072 --> 09:50.339
Semtex, maybe.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.874
Christ, it's enough
to take down the whole building.

09:52.876 --> 09:55.344
Where the hell is it?

09:55.346 --> 09:57.348
I guess we're supposed
to figure that out.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.959
Why the hell do you keep running
toward all the scary shit?

10:14.898 --> 10:17.065
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Hey.

10:17.067 --> 10:18.202
Hey!

10:22.906 --> 10:24.241
You wanna tell us
what you're doing here?

10:26.543 --> 10:29.144
Same thing you're doing
I'd imagine.

10:29.146 --> 10:30.814
Trying to get out of here alive.

10:35.619 --> 10:37.121
You tried to escape.

11:03.314 --> 11:06.481
Gerry, you're late.

11:06.483 --> 11:08.218
And I have a schedule to keep.

11:08.886 --> 11:10.821
You're cutting it awfully close.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.322
You've had months.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.191
Have you ever known me
to let you down?

11:16.193 --> 11:18.962
This isn't exactly the plan
we signed up for.

11:20.631 --> 11:22.232
Why you here, Gerry?

11:23.367 --> 11:25.668
Because they're worried.

11:25.670 --> 11:27.002
Because it's tonight,

11:27.004 --> 11:30.207
and because I wanna make damn
sure our investment is safe.

11:31.375 --> 11:32.843
Is it?

11:34.378 --> 11:35.612
Look for yourself.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.460
You know, I've been
doing this a long time

11:50.494 --> 11:52.327
and if there's one thing
I've learned

11:52.329 --> 11:55.432
it's that people
are who they are.

11:56.533 --> 11:58.701
I look at this,
and I wonder

11:58.703 --> 12:02.705
what makes you think that they're
going to do what you want them to do?

12:02.707 --> 12:04.508
Well, because they have
no choice.

12:06.176 --> 12:09.279
Because they are...
who they are.

12:12.082 --> 12:15.050
What's this?

12:15.052 --> 12:18.389
I'm not the one who's going to have
to pay if this doesn't work out.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.193
Always nice to chat, Theo.

12:24.461 --> 12:26.196
Lovely to see you too, Gerry.

12:48.753 --> 12:50.087
No, thank you.

13:00.998 --> 13:02.466
Anybody mind?

13:05.135 --> 13:07.770
I was out in the hallway,
I was looking for a way out,

13:07.772 --> 13:09.204
all hell broke loose.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.175
You didn't feel like
coming out to say hello?

13:12.443 --> 13:14.176
Oh...

13:14.178 --> 13:16.478
let's just say I'm a bit shy
by nature,

13:16.480 --> 13:19.414
and I wanted to know
who I was dealing with first.

13:19.416 --> 13:21.249
You satisfied?

13:21.251 --> 13:23.053
Entirely.

13:24.021 --> 13:25.387
What's so funny?

13:25.389 --> 13:27.991
Well, you have to admire
the humor of this situation.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.527
I mean, four thieves
locked up

13:32.529 --> 13:34.629
and we haven't even committed
a crime yet.

13:34.631 --> 13:36.364
Thieves? You know,

13:36.366 --> 13:39.267
I'll have you know
I'm a contractor.

13:39.269 --> 13:41.004
Of course, you are, my dear.

13:42.674 --> 13:44.039
Now, listen up, kids...

13:44.041 --> 13:48.076
if you wanna know what's going
on, take a good look around you.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.745
We're all players.

13:49.747 --> 13:52.447
- Experts in our field.
- Get to the point.

13:52.449 --> 13:54.351
You wanna
know the point, big guy?

13:55.352 --> 13:59.621
The point is, we're all
career criminals...

13:59.623 --> 14:01.525
and this is a four-man crew.

14:03.393 --> 14:06.497
The mechanic. Rough, brawny.

14:07.799 --> 14:09.832
And you, dear lady,

14:09.834 --> 14:12.567
graceful, nimble.

14:12.569 --> 14:14.603
You're the B&E specialist.

14:14.605 --> 14:17.274
We called them cat burglars
back in my day.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.244
And that leaves you.

14:21.211 --> 14:23.411
You slick-fingered devil.

14:23.413 --> 14:25.547
The safe cracker.

14:25.549 --> 14:28.316
What does that make you,
smart guy?

14:28.318 --> 14:30.387
I guess that makes me
the smart guy.

14:31.321 --> 14:32.822
So...

14:32.824 --> 14:35.557
anybody figure out what
we're supposed to steal yet?

14:35.559 --> 14:37.494
You pricks did your homework.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.134
Who are you?

14:45.402 --> 14:47.137
Well, I'll start with
the more infamous first.

14:48.338 --> 14:51.341
Boston Museum,
18th of March, 1990.

14:53.110 --> 14:55.577
- Nah.
- Oh, yes.

14:55.579 --> 14:58.215
The frames of the pictures
are still hanging on the wall.

15:00.117 --> 15:02.117
No way that was you.

15:02.119 --> 15:03.753
Grayson Bishop.
And it most certainly was.

15:03.755 --> 15:06.521
In fact, I still have
one of the Van Goghs

15:06.523 --> 15:09.357
hidden in a basement
somewhere to prove it.

15:09.359 --> 15:12.695
So, an old-school
master thief, huh?

15:12.697 --> 15:14.264
Maybe you're the one
behind this?

15:15.198 --> 15:17.499
Teach yourself a few new tricks.

15:17.501 --> 15:21.303
I seriously doubt there
is anything you can teach me.

15:21.305 --> 15:24.809
Besides, do you think
I would try to blow myself up?

15:25.843 --> 15:27.544
This doesn't make any sense.

15:28.412 --> 15:29.513
Why us?

15:30.614 --> 15:33.148
Well, I'm the very best
at what I do

15:33.150 --> 15:35.317
and I'm assuming you are
as well.

15:35.319 --> 15:37.753
Otherwise I would be
completely insulted.

15:37.755 --> 15:39.755
It would be easier
to hire us, no?

15:39.757 --> 15:41.189
Maybe.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.194
Or maybe it's someone who knows
that we would never work for them.

15:44.729 --> 15:46.461
Or better yet,

15:46.463 --> 15:48.731
maybe it's someone
that wanted us fucked over.

15:48.733 --> 15:50.167
Like who?

15:51.401 --> 15:53.435
Do you got any enemies, kid?

15:53.437 --> 15:55.871
Because believe me,
I have a long list.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.742
Don't call me kid,
you old fogy.

15:58.843 --> 16:00.609
You make me glad I'm an orphan.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.179
And an angry one at that.

16:06.851 --> 16:08.552
So what are we gonna do?

16:13.223 --> 16:15.258
We live or we die.

16:17.862 --> 16:20.328
Doesn't sound like
much of a choice to me.

16:20.330 --> 16:22.132
Excellent conclusion, dear.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.167
Harris.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.603
It's so good to see you.

17:05.242 --> 17:06.476
What's this?

17:09.513 --> 17:12.950
Our border guy, he's reliable,
right?

17:13.985 --> 17:15.617
He is.

17:15.619 --> 17:17.787
We've used him before.
You paid top dollar.

17:17.789 --> 17:19.957
He was instructed to turn off the
cameras, was he not?

17:21.591 --> 17:22.794
Yes, sir.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.561
By you?

17:29.701 --> 17:31.201
Yes, I told him.

17:58.696 --> 17:59.897
I'll fix it.

18:01.032 --> 18:03.433
There is no fixing it, Harris.

18:04.634 --> 18:07.437
I'll... I'll figure it out.
I'll talk...

18:07.972 --> 18:09.573
I'll talk to him.

18:12.910 --> 18:15.044
You weigh...

18:15.046 --> 18:17.612
about 75 kilograms,
Is that right?

18:17.614 --> 18:18.750
Yeah.

18:20.785 --> 18:22.417
Shouldn't take too long.

18:22.419 --> 18:25.386
And please,
just don't fight it.

18:25.388 --> 18:26.824
It's easier that way.

18:29.392 --> 18:31.761
See, Harris, every piece

18:31.763 --> 18:33.963
has a purpose.

18:33.965 --> 18:36.564
And every move has a meaning.

18:36.566 --> 18:38.770
And if you can't follow
the rules...

18:40.403 --> 18:42.037
everyone loses.

18:58.022 --> 19:01.058
You're in charge now,
and be careful decontaminating.

19:13.938 --> 19:17.438
We have to gain access
though the main elevator.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.509
<i>Then, we have to open a security
door with an electronic lock.</i>

19:21.511 --> 19:25.915
<i>Next, we navigate a tunnel
secured by motion sensors.</i>

19:25.917 --> 19:28.651
<i>Then, unbreakable
tempered glass.</i>

19:28.653 --> 19:30.886
<i>Once through,
it's the vault room</i>

19:30.888 --> 19:34.491
<i>which brings us to the custom
1970s Mosler.</i>

19:35.993 --> 19:37.993
Even if you could do all that,

19:37.995 --> 19:39.762
which you can't...

19:39.764 --> 19:41.664
What's your exit plan?

19:41.666 --> 19:44.767
I was thinking I'd just walk
out the front door.

19:44.769 --> 19:47.069
It's kinda the point of
not setting off any alarms.

19:47.071 --> 19:49.040
That much security,
what's in the vault?

19:49.674 --> 19:51.106
Gold.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.440
Bonds?

19:52.442 --> 19:53.543
It's diamonds.

19:54.511 --> 19:56.113
- What?
- It's diamonds.

19:57.181 --> 19:58.983
And it all started right here.

20:00.151 --> 20:02.017
John D. Rockefeller.

20:02.019 --> 20:03.953
Son of a con artist.

20:03.955 --> 20:05.957
Became one of
the wealthiest men in America.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.824
So, he had diamonds...

20:08.826 --> 20:10.993
a lot of diamonds.

20:10.995 --> 20:14.529
Hidden assets
from the government I assume.

20:14.531 --> 20:16.665
Anyway, they're all stored
right here in the museum.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.000
At least for now.

20:18.002 --> 20:21.536
I mean, they move 'em around
from time to time.

20:21.538 --> 20:23.772
It was last rumored
that they were in Italy.

20:23.774 --> 20:25.674
Florence to be exact.

20:25.676 --> 20:26.976
How do you know?

20:26.978 --> 20:28.844
It's about the Mosler.

20:28.846 --> 20:30.112
You see,
it's a bit of a legend

20:30.114 --> 20:32.081
in certain rarefied circles.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.016
It's never been cracked yet...

20:34.018 --> 20:35.518
though it has been tried.

20:36.687 --> 20:38.888
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

20:38.890 --> 20:41.690
Could be. But our captor
believes it's true.

20:41.692 --> 20:43.526
So then, what do they
want us to do?

20:44.128 --> 20:46.628
Draw them a map?

20:46.630 --> 20:48.596
They've already got
the blueprints.

20:48.598 --> 20:50.533
- They want us to steal it.
- No.

20:51.202 --> 20:52.803
They want us to pretend to.

20:53.871 --> 20:56.741
How's that
for a slice of humble pie?

21:05.016 --> 21:06.749
It's right this way, guys.

21:06.751 --> 21:08.516
And why should I
trust you, pops?

21:08.518 --> 21:10.585
Maybe you're walking us
to an early grave.

21:10.587 --> 21:12.553
This whole place is a grave.

21:12.555 --> 21:14.489
You shouldn't trust me.
I don't trust you.

21:14.491 --> 21:17.726
I mean,
after all, we are criminals.

21:17.728 --> 21:20.195
You're a real ray of
sunshine, you know that?

21:20.197 --> 21:23.598
And you're a shoe size
passing for an IQ, dear boy.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.835
There it is.

21:26.170 --> 21:27.604
Would you look at that.

21:30.174 --> 21:31.876
<i>Just like in the blueprints.</i>

21:34.544 --> 21:36.147
They built a replica of
the museum?

21:41.752 --> 21:44.253
They want us to
practice the heist.

21:44.255 --> 21:46.956
They're gonna watch our every
move, and when we're done...

21:46.958 --> 21:48.657
Boom.

21:48.659 --> 21:50.025
And then?

21:50.027 --> 21:51.929
and then, someone else
follows in our footsteps.

21:52.930 --> 21:54.897
And we are all okay with this?

21:54.899 --> 21:56.667
Do you have any other options?

22:03.240 --> 22:04.740
Shit.

22:04.742 --> 22:07.910
Well, I thought you were
the safe cracker.

22:07.912 --> 22:10.578
This isn't a safe. It's...

22:10.580 --> 22:11.646
a computer.

22:11.648 --> 22:14.183
No, it's not. It's a puzzle.

22:14.185 --> 22:16.785
It's a Henderson digital lock.
It releases.

22:16.787 --> 22:20.189
The way it works, it has four
bolts from the door to the frame.

22:20.191 --> 22:22.623
- Then we can use a gun.
- That's unnecessary.

22:22.625 --> 22:23.959
Oh, yeah, why is that?

22:23.961 --> 22:26.028
Because this particular lock

22:26.030 --> 22:29.832
depends on a person. A person who
comes up with a four-digit pin.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.501
Yeah, well, that's like...

22:32.602 --> 22:34.703
a million different
combinations.

22:34.705 --> 22:36.005
Permutations.

22:36.007 --> 22:39.942
And it's 9,999,
give or take a fraction or two.

22:39.944 --> 22:42.077
But you see, our advantage is

22:42.079 --> 22:44.113
that Henderson keypads

22:44.115 --> 22:46.315
use silicone with
positive printing.

22:46.317 --> 22:47.916
What the hell does that mean?

22:47.918 --> 22:50.686
What that means is that
the surface clings

22:50.688 --> 22:51.989
to the oil
from our fingertips.

22:53.824 --> 22:55.893
Move over, kid.
You're blocking the view.

23:01.265 --> 23:02.666
All right.

23:06.037 --> 23:08.806
Ah, this should be easy.
Twenty-four permutations.

23:20.684 --> 23:21.752
Voila.

23:22.820 --> 23:24.053
There it is.

23:24.055 --> 23:25.721
How did you know
the combo?

23:25.723 --> 23:27.356
I don't know the combo.

23:27.358 --> 23:29.892
I know people,
and I know my keypads.

23:29.894 --> 23:33.162
Yeah, but the keypad at the museum
is not gonna be the same code.

23:33.164 --> 23:35.230
This is just a replica.

23:35.232 --> 23:38.000
Well, then it's a good thing we'll
all be dead, and it won't be us

23:38.002 --> 23:39.737
actually the heist then,
isn't it?

24:20.878 --> 24:23.848
I'm assuming the real security
system won't have an off switch.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.887
That's where it is.

24:30.955 --> 24:32.756
That's where they hid the bomb.

24:47.138 --> 24:48.638
They found the replica.

24:49.974 --> 24:51.840
They're behind.

24:51.842 --> 24:53.108
What about Grayson?

24:53.110 --> 24:55.177
Played out just like
you said it would.

24:55.179 --> 24:57.012
He got everyone on task,

24:57.014 --> 24:58.883
and he cracked
the security code quick.

25:00.284 --> 25:01.652
And now...

25:03.254 --> 25:04.288
it's showtime.

25:11.996 --> 25:14.096
I don't know why you
brought the whole tool shed.

25:14.098 --> 25:16.367
There's nothing in there
to protect from lightsabers.

25:21.805 --> 25:23.340
What's she on about?

25:24.775 --> 25:26.076
I can do this.

25:26.810 --> 25:27.978
Do what?

25:34.051 --> 25:36.418
We need to redirect the laser.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.387
Did you bring the mirror?

26:02.146 --> 26:03.447
And see?

26:04.448 --> 26:06.016
Now it's in front of me.

26:35.179 --> 26:36.380
Your turn.

27:01.372 --> 27:02.873
Shouldn't we be
motivating the others?

27:04.475 --> 27:05.876
I was just...

27:06.944 --> 27:08.910
looking for a weak spot.

27:08.912 --> 27:10.447
It's hard work
leading a crew.

27:12.116 --> 27:13.484
I'm not leading anything.

27:15.286 --> 27:17.121
See, it's not just
about skills.

27:18.322 --> 27:20.057
It's about personalities.

27:21.258 --> 27:24.361
You know Mag,
she's strong and silent.

27:26.363 --> 27:28.096
Bruised...

27:28.098 --> 27:29.466
but very reliable.

27:30.334 --> 27:32.200
And Rowan,

27:32.202 --> 27:34.405
he's a joker
but he knows his shite.

27:36.473 --> 27:37.908
And me...

27:40.577 --> 27:42.313
I'm the wiseass wise man.

27:44.148 --> 27:45.449
What about you, Kate?

27:46.317 --> 27:48.417
What are you gonna
bring to the party

27:48.419 --> 27:50.087
that's gonna take us
to the promised land?

27:51.622 --> 27:53.891
I'm not taking you anywhere.

27:54.425 --> 27:55.991
I don't know you.

27:55.993 --> 27:57.459
I know you.

27:57.461 --> 27:58.896
Should we cut the crap?

28:00.397 --> 28:01.598
Excuse me?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.369
Your Bingham Paxton's
granddaughter.

28:06.036 --> 28:08.103
Corsica Cabal.

28:08.105 --> 28:10.038
You don't know what
you're talking about.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.442
Spoken like a career criminal.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.410
There's no point
in us lying to each other.

28:15.412 --> 28:17.147
We're all in this together.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.949
You mind me asking,

28:20.951 --> 28:23.385
how did he get pinched?

28:23.387 --> 28:25.989
Your grandfather was a brilliant
man, and I was an admirer.

28:30.494 --> 28:31.628
It was a job.

28:33.330 --> 28:34.465
Italy.

28:36.633 --> 28:39.036
I was trying to crack a vault
and I took too long.

28:40.270 --> 28:42.272
Police were supposed to be
diverted, but...

28:46.510 --> 28:48.110
I escaped with the rest
of the crew,

28:48.112 --> 28:49.279
my grandfather
took the fall.

28:51.415 --> 28:52.549
What kind of vault?

28:56.453 --> 28:58.622
What kind of vault, Kate?
It's important.

29:00.591 --> 29:02.493
- A Mosler.
- A Mosler.

29:06.263 --> 29:08.530
This was your grandfather's
final score.

29:10.601 --> 29:12.670
He died in prison,
didn't he?

29:14.071 --> 29:15.606
And it's all your fault.

29:22.045 --> 29:24.446
You think you have
the answers to everything.

29:24.448 --> 29:26.148
Listen to me,

29:26.150 --> 29:29.451
we do not have to do
what they want us to do.

29:29.453 --> 29:31.119
You and I could figure
something out.

29:31.121 --> 29:32.322
We don't have
to play their game.

29:33.190 --> 29:35.357
I don't have to play
your game either.

29:35.359 --> 29:38.360
I don't think you understand
the variables here.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.128
We're pawns.

29:40.130 --> 29:41.532
We're pawns in something
much bigger.

29:45.436 --> 29:46.437
Hey.

29:47.070 --> 29:49.004
We're ready.

29:49.006 --> 29:50.407
Rowan's got an idea
for the glass.

30:01.753 --> 30:04.555
All right. Here's the news.

30:05.289 --> 30:08.658
Prorated 10-hour
tempered glass.

30:08.660 --> 30:12.162
Steel can be cut,
stone can be broken...

30:13.096 --> 30:14.797
but this...

30:14.799 --> 30:17.468
This some new age
super-human shit.

30:19.771 --> 30:22.404
It's the kind insurance
companies love to see.

30:22.406 --> 30:26.243
Now the vibration might be able to
undermine the strength of the glass.

30:47.464 --> 30:49.132
You said it would break.

30:50.768 --> 30:53.335
- There's not even a dent.
- No.

30:53.337 --> 30:55.439
What I said was,
we might be able to weaken it.

30:56.173 --> 30:57.274
We need a minute.

30:58.575 --> 31:00.175
Hell with this.

31:00.177 --> 31:01.311
I'll join you.

31:24.134 --> 31:26.201
I thought you were supposed
to be some kind of an expert.

31:26.203 --> 31:27.870
Christ, will you back off?

31:27.872 --> 31:31.108
Are all girls in Arizona
this mean, or is it just you?

31:32.677 --> 31:34.543
I'm from Mexico.

31:34.545 --> 31:37.813
Oh, lemme guess,
Cancun, Acapulco?

31:37.815 --> 31:41.416
Hone your skills breaking into
rich tourist hotel rooms?

31:41.418 --> 31:44.486
- Sinaloa.
- Oh, cartel country.

31:44.488 --> 31:46.323
No wonder you're so friendly.

31:47.124 --> 31:48.525
But I was raised

31:49.027 --> 31:51.094
in the Magical Crew.

31:52.162 --> 31:53.665
So, all my friends

31:54.498 --> 31:55.800
are dead.

31:57.334 --> 31:58.635
Fair enough.

32:01.171 --> 32:02.606
This is not about me.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.576
This is about Kate.

32:07.277 --> 32:09.714
I overheard her
talking to Grayson.

32:11.816 --> 32:13.083
She's Cabal.

32:13.617 --> 32:15.851
You don't say.

32:15.853 --> 32:18.723
- Granddaughter of the great Bingham himself.
- Hmm.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.392
- And I do not trust her.
- Well...

32:23.594 --> 32:25.830
trust is hard to come by
these days.

32:27.364 --> 32:30.231
I think that maybe
we should keep an eye on her.

32:30.233 --> 32:31.703
Well, I'm keeping
an eye on everyone.

32:35.572 --> 32:37.707
You're an idiot...

32:37.709 --> 32:39.509
if you are not scared of them.

32:40.510 --> 32:41.779
You should be.

32:42.646 --> 32:44.212
They could be behind this,

32:44.214 --> 32:46.882
and we have the cub in our den.

32:46.884 --> 32:50.218
And what exactly do you
want me to do about it?

32:50.220 --> 32:52.356
I wanna show them
that we are serious.

33:05.770 --> 33:07.471
Come up with anything?

33:09.239 --> 33:11.575
Pass me the, uh, splicer there.

33:18.783 --> 33:20.484
So, what did you
and Grayson talk about?

33:22.987 --> 33:25.555
A score... you know,
what else.

33:26.791 --> 33:28.791
Play poker?

33:28.793 --> 33:31.426
- No.
- Well, you should.

33:31.428 --> 33:34.396
- You're a great liar.
- What?

33:34.398 --> 33:36.166
Quick!

33:45.342 --> 33:46.643
What the hell?

33:49.279 --> 33:50.414
You're working with them.

33:50.982 --> 33:52.416
- Who?
- The Cabal.

33:53.918 --> 33:55.583
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:55.585 --> 33:57.419
I overheard you
talking to Grayson.

33:57.421 --> 33:59.554
You're Cabal,
and they are behind this.

33:59.556 --> 34:01.356
Why would they do that?

34:01.358 --> 34:03.491
They are the only ones with
the resources for this, no?

34:03.493 --> 34:05.427
You're making a mistake.

34:05.429 --> 34:07.963
We need each other
if we're gonna get outta here.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.531
I think...

34:09.533 --> 34:12.269
that maybe you need us.

34:13.871 --> 34:17.272
And they need you
in one piece.

34:17.274 --> 34:19.742
And maybe, if they're
worried about you,

34:19.744 --> 34:21.609
they'll pop open the door.

34:21.611 --> 34:24.214
Only if they know that we are serious.

34:28.853 --> 34:30.686
What the hell is going on here?

34:30.688 --> 34:31.787
Nothing important.

34:31.789 --> 34:34.556
Just a small hiccup
in group trust.

34:34.558 --> 34:36.792
- Don't be absurd.
- What are you doing?

34:36.794 --> 34:38.661
Take it easy, old boy.

34:38.663 --> 34:40.796
- We need her.
- She's Cabal.

34:40.798 --> 34:42.397
So what?

34:42.399 --> 34:43.835
She was Cabal.

34:44.301 --> 34:46.367
She's not anymore.

34:46.369 --> 34:47.635
Believe me
when I tell you this.

34:47.637 --> 34:49.739
She is not the one
responsible for all this.

34:49.741 --> 34:51.306
How do you know?

34:51.308 --> 34:53.641
She would never we caught dead
working for scum.

34:53.643 --> 34:55.980
The likes of Theodore Thurlo III.

34:57.414 --> 35:01.516
Who the hell is
Theodore Thurlo III?

35:01.518 --> 35:03.819
I mean, did we get kidnapped
by a knight of the Round Table?

35:05.422 --> 35:08.356
He's the man behind
this current predicament.

35:08.358 --> 35:09.825
And believe me,

35:09.827 --> 35:12.262
indirectly he has
a deep connection to you.

35:12.797 --> 35:14.663
Bollocks, mate.

35:14.665 --> 35:16.498
You were born in Dublin,
weren't ya?

35:16.500 --> 35:17.933
Yeah, I was.

35:17.935 --> 35:20.970
Theo had some crews there
back in the day.

35:20.972 --> 35:23.806
You see, the one thing
you have to know about our boy,

35:23.808 --> 35:25.941
he doesn't like
to leave witnesses.

35:25.943 --> 35:28.376
Even crew.

35:28.378 --> 35:30.746
I understand there were a lot
of bodies left behind in Dublin

35:30.748 --> 35:32.715
when he pulled out.

35:32.717 --> 35:34.584
You did say you were an orphan,
didn't you?

35:36.353 --> 35:38.386
And you, my dear...

35:38.388 --> 35:40.890
you were part of
the Magical Crew.

35:40.892 --> 35:44.960
Well, of course,
you don't have crew anymore.

35:44.962 --> 35:48.130
They all went the way
of the bullet except you.

35:48.132 --> 35:51.000
That's a terrible shame,
now isn't it?

35:51.002 --> 35:55.403
A street kid like you
raised in the gutter.

35:55.405 --> 35:59.574
I understand that Theo used to recruit
all the urchins on the streets of Mexico.

35:59.576 --> 36:00.945
Only he didn't treat 'em
so good.

36:02.646 --> 36:04.445
You don't know what
you're talking about.

36:04.447 --> 36:05.413
Oh, I think I do.

36:05.415 --> 36:08.518
In fact, I think Dickens
wrote a book about it.

36:10.121 --> 36:11.789
Scooped up...

36:13.925 --> 36:15.392
taught to steal...

36:16.027 --> 36:18.127
taught to kill...

36:18.129 --> 36:21.730
turned into something
that you absolutely despised.

36:21.732 --> 36:25.102
And then betrayed,
and left for dead.

36:28.906 --> 36:30.840
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

36:30.842 --> 36:31.807
It's okay.

36:31.809 --> 36:33.978
Well, that's a hell
of a punch you got there.

36:37.048 --> 36:39.114
How do you know Theo?

36:39.116 --> 36:41.016
What did he do to you?

36:41.018 --> 36:44.689
Well... it's more like
what I did to him.

36:46.691 --> 36:47.792
The paintings.

36:49.492 --> 36:52.695
Boston Museum,
you screwed him over.

36:52.697 --> 36:54.763
No, I did not screw him over.

36:54.765 --> 36:57.599
Let's just say I got the first
punch in and won the day.

36:57.601 --> 36:59.201
And now he's
taking his revenge.

36:59.203 --> 37:00.872
It's all bullshit.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.471
You know that, right?

37:03.473 --> 37:05.640
You don't know shit about us.

37:05.642 --> 37:08.746
Well, then, let's just say I came
up with a good cover story for you.

37:15.086 --> 37:16.919
You better listen up,

37:16.921 --> 37:20.555
and listen to me
real good, people.

37:20.557 --> 37:23.458
You're gonna have to be a lot
smarter about what you're doing

37:23.460 --> 37:25.395
if you plan on
getting out of here alive.

37:37.708 --> 37:39.607
Time to start phase two.

39:01.959 --> 39:03.859
What are you doing?

39:03.861 --> 39:05.894
What we should
all be doing.

39:05.896 --> 39:07.930
Trying to find a way out.

39:07.932 --> 39:12.001
You're wasting your time.
You're wasting our time.

39:12.003 --> 39:14.238
What, you think they'd just leave
this open so you can climb up?

39:15.006 --> 39:16.138
What do you know?

39:16.140 --> 39:18.639
I know that someone
has their finger on a trigger,

39:18.641 --> 39:19.944
not much else
I need to know.

39:32.189 --> 39:34.857
Look, you don't like me.

39:34.859 --> 39:37.092
- Fine. I get it.
- No.

39:37.094 --> 39:38.927
No, you don't get it.

39:38.929 --> 39:40.064
You don't get a fucking thing.

39:41.198 --> 39:42.931
You're Cabal.

39:42.933 --> 39:45.100
With all your rituals
and your rules,

39:45.102 --> 39:46.804
and your lines of succession,
all of that shit...

39:48.172 --> 39:50.305
You're just a bunch
of spoiled,

39:50.307 --> 39:52.877
entitled, aristocrats
playing pirate.

39:57.048 --> 39:58.947
You don't know what
you're talking about.

39:58.949 --> 40:02.751
Everything that I know
I learned myself.

40:02.753 --> 40:04.887
I didn't have no private lessons

40:04.889 --> 40:06.323
in some European castle.

40:08.259 --> 40:10.995
You know, I fought
and I bled...

40:12.396 --> 40:14.763
and I'm gonna do the same thing
to get out of here.

40:14.765 --> 40:17.699
This won't end the way
you think it will.

40:17.701 --> 40:19.268
Not if we don't work together.

40:19.270 --> 40:21.403
- Ladies?
- What?

40:21.405 --> 40:23.005
What did you do?

40:23.007 --> 40:24.173
Nothing.

40:24.175 --> 40:26.341
Bullshit you did nothing!

40:26.343 --> 40:28.846
Because I know I did nothing
and youse two are...

40:29.880 --> 40:31.847
Wait. What are youse doing?

40:31.849 --> 40:33.982
Not running around
like rats in a maze.

40:33.984 --> 40:37.086
Oh, Jesus.
You sound like Grayson.

40:37.088 --> 40:39.088
Can one of youse explain to me

40:39.090 --> 40:41.990
- why we only have two hours left, huh?
- What?

40:41.992 --> 40:44.126
That's not right.
We should have a little under three.

40:44.128 --> 40:48.197
Well, you must have
pissed somebody off then.

40:48.199 --> 40:50.432
- Now, can we get back to work please?
- Why?

40:50.434 --> 40:52.903
- This whole thing is obviously rigged.
- Maybe...

40:54.338 --> 40:56.974
but Rowan's right,
and we need your help.

40:57.908 --> 40:59.842
There is no "we" here, okay?

40:59.844 --> 41:01.045
There is today.

41:03.914 --> 41:04.949
What the hell was that?

41:06.417 --> 41:08.217
I smell smoke.

41:08.219 --> 41:10.152
Where's Grayson?

41:10.154 --> 41:12.256
Having a sniff
the last time we checked.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.909
- What the hell?
- It's the blueprints.

41:32.476 --> 41:33.775
What's he playing at?

41:33.777 --> 41:35.379
Forgive the chicanery,
my friends.

41:42.419 --> 41:44.155
- Damn it!
- Prick!

41:44.889 --> 41:46.855
Fuck that bastard.

41:46.857 --> 41:48.457
Do you know how to fix this?

41:48.459 --> 41:49.760
Uh,
gimme a minute, will ya?

41:52.830 --> 41:54.830
You always did have
a big laugh at me,

41:54.832 --> 41:56.398
didn't you, big guy?

41:56.400 --> 41:58.000
Well, it's nice to know

41:58.002 --> 42:00.838
that today is gonna be
more of the same.

42:08.012 --> 42:10.281
I know you can hear me,
you treacherous prick.

42:11.315 --> 42:13.982
So, grab a handful,
asshole,

42:13.984 --> 42:16.353
and pucker those lips
and start smooching.

42:19.757 --> 42:21.123
He's probably looking for a way out.

42:21.125 --> 42:22.359
We are too, you prick.

42:23.294 --> 42:26.495
16,000 degrees of separation,

42:26.497 --> 42:29.233
and I spit my last breath
in your face.

42:34.205 --> 42:35.372
He's gonna burn
the whole place down.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.774
Shit.

42:38.776 --> 42:39.910
He might actually get though.

42:40.544 --> 42:42.811
- Arm it.
- You sure?

42:42.813 --> 42:44.181
Arm it!

42:53.490 --> 42:54.725
Shit.

42:55.993 --> 42:58.060
- Hurry!
- Shut up, will ya.

42:58.062 --> 42:59.494
Why couldn't it be
his own bollocks?

42:59.496 --> 43:01.198
He's gonna get us all killed.

43:01.966 --> 43:03.000
Now!

43:12.509 --> 43:13.877
You sure?

43:16.046 --> 43:17.281
Wait.

43:20.985 --> 43:22.253
I'll do it.

43:46.910 --> 43:49.278
Son of a bitch.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.179
Hey. Hey.

43:51.181 --> 43:52.950
- What took you so long?
- Shh.

43:54.051 --> 43:55.917
What the hell were you thinking?

43:55.919 --> 43:58.186
Oh, just thought that

43:58.188 --> 43:59.888
I'd give you guys
a head start.

43:59.890 --> 44:02.357
You wanted to see,
so to speak.

44:02.359 --> 44:05.494
I'm afraid it's up to you to
take 'em to the promised land.

44:05.496 --> 44:08.365
Shh. Just... Just stay still.

44:11.368 --> 44:12.836
See it through.

44:36.661 --> 44:38.062
Go back. I wanna know
what he told her.

44:48.138 --> 44:50.007
- Can't make it out.
- Well, try harder.

44:52.009 --> 44:54.511
- I can't.
- Kei, try harder!

44:55.546 --> 44:57.314
Grayson never was
a team player.

44:59.216 --> 45:02.484
- I just meant he...
- The man was an artist.

45:02.486 --> 45:05.287
He pulled off the greatest
art heist in history.

45:05.289 --> 45:07.224
Show some goddamn respect.

45:22.139 --> 45:24.206
Gerry.

45:24.208 --> 45:27.609
Please don't try to tell me
that this was part of the plan.

45:27.611 --> 45:29.712
It wasn't entirely unexpected.

45:29.714 --> 45:31.446
I have no idea what that means.

45:31.448 --> 45:34.316
What it means, Gerry,
is that he fulfilled his role.

45:34.318 --> 45:36.585
And sometimes you have
to trade a pawn

45:36.587 --> 45:38.688
to put your pieces
in the right position.

45:38.690 --> 45:41.356
Just remember who
you're playing with.

45:41.358 --> 45:43.358
No more sacrifices.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.095
Get me those diamonds.

45:57.141 --> 46:00.609
Grayson went at it alone
and look wat happened to him.

46:00.611 --> 46:03.247
I'm not... We're not
gonna make the same mistake.

46:04.314 --> 46:06.651
If we're gonna win this,
we need to get through it.

46:08.285 --> 46:09.453
You have a choice to make.

46:10.421 --> 46:12.755
I've made mine.

46:12.757 --> 46:15.526
We either die in here,
or we get out together.

46:25.737 --> 46:26.970
Try it again.

46:40.551 --> 46:42.184
Anything we can use?

46:42.186 --> 46:45.153
It's shite, garbage and junk.

46:45.155 --> 46:46.223
Come on, there's
gotta be something.

46:47.157 --> 46:48.392
Cut it sharper.

46:51.663 --> 46:53.063
Again.

46:54.465 --> 46:56.264
Okay, try again.

46:56.266 --> 46:58.066
All right.

46:58.068 --> 47:00.368
- Bring me the drone.
- Why?

47:00.370 --> 47:02.304
The camera's got a memory card.

47:02.306 --> 47:03.440
Again. Higher.

47:04.074 --> 47:05.207
Try again.

47:05.209 --> 47:07.077
We're not gonna have
time to make these adjustments.

47:29.299 --> 47:30.534
Well done.

47:41.345 --> 47:44.112
- Why'd you do it?
- Do what?

47:44.114 --> 47:45.616
Rob those banks.

47:47.618 --> 47:49.419
Was it for yourself,
or for someone else?

47:50.688 --> 47:52.587
Let's just say
the Irish system

47:52.589 --> 47:55.025
for young lads without
a family isn't all that great.

47:57.729 --> 48:00.128
I'm sorry.

48:00.130 --> 48:03.231
Pretty soon, you'll find your family on
the inside is worth a hell of a lot more

48:03.233 --> 48:06.370
than whatever fucked up situation
you have on the outside.

48:11.608 --> 48:12.777
Right...

48:13.410 --> 48:14.609
got it.

48:14.611 --> 48:17.047
A1 Charlie Swan.

48:21.418 --> 48:22.486
Steel.

48:24.221 --> 48:25.821
Steel.

48:25.823 --> 48:27.690
Tungsten carbide.

48:27.692 --> 48:29.493
Cobalt... bollocks.

48:30.728 --> 48:32.095
Nothing?

48:34.666 --> 48:37.232
It's got an extremely high
surface compression

48:37.234 --> 48:38.834
stress resistance.

48:38.836 --> 48:41.771
- At least a nine on the Mohs scale.
- What's that?

48:41.773 --> 48:43.505
Means it's hard as hell.

48:43.507 --> 48:44.742
Can anything cut though it?

48:45.475 --> 48:46.676
Diamonds.

48:46.678 --> 48:49.144
But unless you got yourself
engaged lately

48:49.146 --> 48:50.813
you're on the wrong end
of the vault for that.

48:50.815 --> 48:52.614
Well, anything else?

48:52.616 --> 48:54.652
Corundum, ceramic...

49:00.457 --> 49:01.625
Where are you going?

49:02.927 --> 49:04.494
Playin' wagon.

49:20.912 --> 49:22.279
What about this?

49:23.313 --> 49:24.747
What am I looking at here?

49:24.749 --> 49:27.415
Spark plug. Ceramic tip.

49:27.417 --> 49:28.786
- How did you know that?
- My grandfather.

49:29.419 --> 49:30.621
Excuse me.

49:34.424 --> 49:35.891
You have something to
hold this with?

49:35.893 --> 49:38.128
Yeah... here.

49:39.262 --> 49:40.796
Here we go.

49:40.798 --> 49:42.199
Okay.

49:53.310 --> 49:54.478
Wait.

49:58.850 --> 50:00.384
See? A dent.

50:02.219 --> 50:03.387
Smart.

50:05.823 --> 50:08.291
Very good start.

50:14.699 --> 50:16.333
Ceramic tip.

50:17.334 --> 50:18.633
Thank you.

50:18.635 --> 50:19.937
Excuse me, ladies.

50:34.317 --> 50:35.753
Would you look at that.

50:40.524 --> 50:41.591
Come on.

51:12.322 --> 51:13.791
Now, let's see
what you can do.

51:29.941 --> 51:31.408
You sure she can do it?

51:32.043 --> 51:33.276
I'm sure.

51:34.679 --> 51:35.913
How you know?

51:37.581 --> 51:39.616
Because she hates me
too much to fail.

51:40.584 --> 51:41.953
They all do.

51:46.323 --> 51:47.992
How much time do you need?

51:48.926 --> 51:50.627
How much time we got?

51:52.930 --> 51:54.498
Thirty-three minutes.

51:55.565 --> 51:56.834
Is it possible?

51:57.567 --> 51:59.003
It'll have to be.

52:19.623 --> 52:21.726
I'm sorry.

52:22.359 --> 52:24.361
Sorry was three hours ago.

52:26.596 --> 52:28.731
We're running outta time.
She needs our help.

52:28.733 --> 52:30.532
She needs to focus.
Just leave her alone.

52:30.534 --> 52:32.634
Alone? We're a team.

52:32.636 --> 52:34.571
One of us goes down,
we all do.

52:35.006 --> 52:35.938
Look, I...

52:35.940 --> 52:37.907
I know you don't play
well with others.

52:37.909 --> 52:41.643
You got the whole lone wolf act down.
I get that.

52:41.645 --> 52:43.545
But you can't go through life
on your own.

52:43.547 --> 52:45.915
I've gotten by so far,
so thank you very much.

52:45.917 --> 52:47.283
Have ya?

52:47.285 --> 52:49.987
'Cause it seems to me like you
need a hand up from time to time.

52:52.556 --> 52:55.024
When you're on the ground,
in a gutter,

52:55.026 --> 52:56.659
- you know who reaches for you?
- Who?

52:56.661 --> 52:58.093
People who wanna use you,

52:58.095 --> 52:59.728
take advantage of you,

52:59.730 --> 53:01.098
who act like
you owe them your life!

53:03.400 --> 53:05.533
Whatever happened to you,

53:05.535 --> 53:06.671
I'm sorry.

53:07.637 --> 53:09.004
But we need you,

53:09.006 --> 53:11.707
and I'm pretty sure
you need us as well.

53:11.709 --> 53:12.810
All right.

53:19.549 --> 53:20.985
What about the liquid nitrogen?

53:23.187 --> 53:24.789
Could we freeze the lock?

53:26.190 --> 53:28.489
Maybe.

53:28.491 --> 53:29.894
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

53:41.438 --> 53:42.771
Look, we have an idea...

53:42.773 --> 53:44.139
liquid nitrogen.

53:44.141 --> 53:45.007
No, it... It won't work.

53:45.009 --> 53:46.175
There's a pressure
loaded firing pin.

53:46.177 --> 53:48.445
It'll trigger the re-lock
and we'll never get it open.

53:50.647 --> 53:52.081
How much time do we have?

53:52.083 --> 53:54.549
Twenty-one minutes.

53:54.551 --> 53:55.987
You can do it.

54:03.460 --> 54:04.695
Forty-five.

54:10.034 --> 54:11.601
Sixty-three.

54:48.005 --> 54:50.039
- What the hell?
- What's wrong?

54:50.041 --> 54:51.874
I don't know.

54:54.879 --> 54:56.948
It won't... It's not...

55:01.752 --> 55:02.987
Come on!

55:04.722 --> 55:06.556
It should have opened!

55:09.193 --> 55:10.227
I let you down.

55:34.719 --> 55:36.785
Isn't that splendid?

55:36.787 --> 55:40.588
- You sure they cannot see us?
- Looped the feed with the drone's memory cam.

55:40.590 --> 55:42.858
All that prick's
looking at is Kate

55:42.860 --> 55:44.228
sweating over and over again.

55:55.940 --> 55:57.475
Do your thing.

57:17.188 --> 57:18.923
Let's pack it up.

57:29.967 --> 57:31.135
We're on the move.

58:06.070 --> 58:07.870
The police?

58:07.872 --> 58:10.472
Every cop for 10 miles
is headed to the warehouse.

58:10.474 --> 58:12.274
This is our window.

58:12.276 --> 58:14.109
How's our team?

58:14.111 --> 58:15.777
En route.

58:15.779 --> 58:17.146
You have a job to do.

58:17.148 --> 58:18.415
I'll take care of it.

58:52.383 --> 58:54.816
Let's try another garage,
shall we?

58:54.818 --> 58:56.485
We're not the bleeding A-Team.

58:56.487 --> 58:58.055
We don't have time.

58:59.156 --> 59:00.691
Well, let's get going then.

59:11.202 --> 59:13.103
I was just trying
to make it more dramatic.

59:13.971 --> 59:15.139
Let's go.

59:15.773 --> 59:18.042
We have some shopping to do.

59:57.481 --> 59:59.348
You didn't buy anything?

59:59.350 --> 1:00:00.818
Didn't buy nothing.

1:00:12.496 --> 1:00:14.198
Better get going.

1:00:27.311 --> 1:00:29.378
Hey.

1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:30.879
We don't know
how many there are.

1:00:30.881 --> 1:00:33.215
- If you find Theo's crew...
- When...

1:00:33.217 --> 1:00:34.785
I find Theo's crew.

1:00:35.586 --> 1:00:36.887
I'll take care of them all.

1:00:38.889 --> 1:00:40.188
You just worry about
the vault.

1:00:40.190 --> 1:00:41.425
You remember what
I showed you, yeah?

1:00:56.273 --> 1:00:58.373
You sure you wanna do this?

1:00:58.375 --> 1:01:01.343
He threw us in a hole
and left us for dead.

1:01:01.345 --> 1:01:03.912
I'm not gonna let him
get away with it. Are you?

1:01:03.914 --> 1:01:05.249
Or it could be a trap.

1:01:06.083 --> 1:01:08.050
He thinks we're dead.

1:01:08.052 --> 1:01:10.485
He's never gonna see us coming.

1:01:10.487 --> 1:01:12.589
Not till the diamonds
are long gone.

1:01:36.447 --> 1:01:38.013
- He's here.
- <i>Who?</i>

1:01:38.015 --> 1:01:39.083
Theo.

1:01:41.919 --> 1:01:43.587
Hold on.
We might have a problem.

1:01:49.526 --> 1:01:50.994
Kate.

1:01:53.364 --> 1:01:54.565
You look well.

1:01:58.068 --> 1:01:59.534
Try it.

1:01:59.536 --> 1:02:02.239
It's Mortlach, 1935.

1:02:02.873 --> 1:02:04.641
Your grandfather's favorite.

1:02:07.712 --> 1:02:09.712
I'm not here for a drink.

1:02:09.714 --> 1:02:11.014
I'm here for the diamonds.

1:02:12.049 --> 1:02:13.484
Aren't we all, darling.

1:02:15.018 --> 1:02:16.286
Tell me something.

1:02:17.588 --> 1:02:19.156
What do you see?

1:02:23.193 --> 1:02:24.662
Wealth and privilege.

1:02:26.130 --> 1:02:27.364
You know what I see?

1:02:28.632 --> 1:02:31.335
I see the lies
they tell in the morning.

1:02:32.970 --> 1:02:34.204
These people...

1:02:35.038 --> 1:02:37.539
they're here to impress.

1:02:37.541 --> 1:02:38.542
To make a mark.

1:02:40.043 --> 1:02:42.577
- To be seen.
- I'm not.

1:02:42.579 --> 1:02:43.645
What?

1:02:43.647 --> 1:02:45.414
Here to be seen.

1:02:45.416 --> 1:02:46.684
Dressed like that?

1:02:50.053 --> 1:02:52.020
They think
it's an end to itself,

1:02:52.022 --> 1:02:53.557
but I just don't
have time for that.

1:02:55.225 --> 1:02:57.161
So what then? Hmm?

1:02:59.163 --> 1:03:01.632
What do you have time for?

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:07.536
Well, I like to enjoy
the finer things.

1:03:07.538 --> 1:03:10.574
But the acquisition
of those things...

1:03:11.442 --> 1:03:13.308
that's for them.

1:03:13.310 --> 1:03:16.681
I'm addicted to savoring
the subtleties, Kate.

1:03:19.082 --> 1:03:20.451
I love the game.

1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:25.055
Just don't much care
for the prize.

1:03:28.158 --> 1:03:30.360
You really should try it.

1:03:38.302 --> 1:03:42.039
The king-pawn endgame,
it's a difficult position.

1:03:44.208 --> 1:03:46.009
Tell me something, Kate.

1:03:46.811 --> 1:03:48.479
Will you become a queen?

1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:51.648
I guess we'll find out.

1:03:54.218 --> 1:03:55.519
Well, game on.

1:04:07.431 --> 1:04:08.798
Oh, excuse me.

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:10.733
No, my fault.

1:04:10.735 --> 1:04:12.236
Enjoy your evening.

1:04:25.349 --> 1:04:26.416
Hmm.

1:04:47.204 --> 1:04:48.436
I'm here.

1:04:48.438 --> 1:04:50.138
Elevator is on its way.

1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:51.809
<i>Left you a present inside.</i>

1:04:52.744 --> 1:04:54.844
Mag, you there?

1:04:54.846 --> 1:04:56.411
<i>I cannot find Theo's crew.</i>

1:04:56.413 --> 1:04:57.514
Keep looking.

1:07:02.372 --> 1:07:04.341
<i>Rowan, I'm out.
You ready to go?</i>

1:07:05.810 --> 1:07:06.878
Ah.

1:07:10.380 --> 1:07:11.615
Mag, is that you?

1:07:12.182 --> 1:07:13.851
Who the fuck...

1:07:33.938 --> 1:07:35.673
Rowan, what the hell
are you doing?

1:08:37.334 --> 1:08:39.003
Rowan?

1:08:39.804 --> 1:08:41.371
Mag, can you hear me?

1:09:06.396 --> 1:09:07.597
Get in.

1:09:49.974 --> 1:09:51.173
Give me the diamonds, Kate.

1:09:51.175 --> 1:09:55.010
Oh, I don't have them
on me.

1:09:55.012 --> 1:09:56.879
You never leave
the scene with a score.

1:09:56.881 --> 1:09:58.546
My grandfather
taught me that much.

1:09:58.548 --> 1:10:00.051
I'm not holding a carrot.

1:10:01.018 --> 1:10:03.819
If you kill me,
your diamonds will be gone.

1:10:03.821 --> 1:10:04.822
I promise you that.

1:10:06.157 --> 1:10:08.025
So you don't care
about your own life.

1:10:09.526 --> 1:10:10.627
What about Rowan's?

1:10:18.568 --> 1:10:19.802
I just met Rowan today.

1:10:19.804 --> 1:10:21.070
What makes
you think I care?

1:10:21.072 --> 1:10:22.972
Because I know you, Kate.

1:10:22.974 --> 1:10:27.009
It's why I picked you.
It's why I picked all of you.

1:10:27.011 --> 1:10:29.046
It's why I allowed
you to escape.

1:10:29.881 --> 1:10:32.748
- You knew we'd escape.
- Of course.

1:10:32.750 --> 1:10:36.218
- But you tried to kill us.
- That was motivation.

1:10:36.220 --> 1:10:39.422
- But the other team...
- There is no other team, Kate.

1:10:40.658 --> 1:10:43.558
Just you. Every move you made,

1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:46.862
every action you took,
you did it because I planned it

1:10:46.864 --> 1:10:48.531
and I wanted it that way.

1:10:49.166 --> 1:10:50.733
You were pawns in...

1:10:50.735 --> 1:10:53.635
Is this another
chess thing again,

1:10:53.637 --> 1:10:55.405
because I should mention
I'm more of a Monopoly girl.

1:10:56.007 --> 1:10:57.742
- Thimble?
- Top hat.

1:11:02.579 --> 1:11:04.447
I want the diamonds, Kate.

1:11:05.615 --> 1:11:07.515
You kill me, you have nothing.

1:11:07.517 --> 1:11:09.151
I have Rowan,

1:11:09.153 --> 1:11:11.153
and we can make him
talk eventually.

1:11:11.155 --> 1:11:13.789
But Rowan doesn't know
where the diamonds are.

1:11:13.791 --> 1:11:15.090
It's just me.

1:11:15.092 --> 1:11:17.662
And if I die,
your diamonds are gone.

1:11:19.196 --> 1:11:21.263
That would be a mistake.

1:11:21.265 --> 1:11:23.265
For you.

1:11:23.267 --> 1:11:26.001
See, there's no way that you
financed this whole thing yourself.

1:11:26.003 --> 1:11:27.903
So, I'm betting you had
a buyer.

1:11:27.905 --> 1:11:30.839
A buyer who fronted you
enough for this whole operation,

1:11:30.841 --> 1:11:32.174
the replica and all.

1:11:32.176 --> 1:11:33.909
And I'm gonna bet
that this buyer

1:11:33.911 --> 1:11:36.511
isn't the type to just write
this off if you don't deliver.

1:11:36.513 --> 1:11:38.983
So... am I close?

1:11:44.088 --> 1:11:47.756
The diamonds, Kate.

1:11:47.758 --> 1:11:49.258
If I don't tell you
where they are,

1:11:49.260 --> 1:11:51.660
no matter
what happens to me,

1:11:51.662 --> 1:11:53.030
they'll come for you.

1:11:54.899 --> 1:11:56.767
Are there dice in Chess?

1:12:01.538 --> 1:12:02.907
Oh, very well.

1:12:03.975 --> 1:12:06.543
Kei, call Vince.

1:12:08.713 --> 1:12:13.117
Let's give Kate a little taste
of what's about to come.

1:12:24.729 --> 1:12:26.496
Is there a problem, Kei?

1:13:05.236 --> 1:13:08.072
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:13:54.051 --> 1:13:55.653
Mag, are you there?

1:13:57.721 --> 1:14:00.191
Mag, can you hear me?
I'm heading to the rendezvous point.

1:14:12.436 --> 1:14:14.436
- Mag?
- What happened?

1:14:14.438 --> 1:14:16.006
Yeah, we gotta go.

1:14:16.774 --> 1:14:17.975
Let's go.

1:14:20.111 --> 1:14:21.310
Mag, what the hell
are you doing?

1:14:21.312 --> 1:14:22.813
I'm sorry, Kate.

1:14:43.267 --> 1:14:44.735
You don't have to do this.

1:14:46.971 --> 1:14:48.370
It's not too late.

1:14:48.372 --> 1:14:49.874
It is for me.

1:15:19.270 --> 1:15:20.704
How much is he paying you?

1:15:21.272 --> 1:15:22.273
I didn't pay her.

1:15:24.008 --> 1:15:25.209
I raised her.

1:15:33.918 --> 1:15:37.386
Kate, let's just stop this,
all right.

1:15:37.388 --> 1:15:39.188
Make it easy on ourselves,

1:15:39.190 --> 1:15:40.991
and just tell me
where the diamonds are.

1:15:41.992 --> 1:15:44.993
The diamonds are the only
thing keeping me alive.

1:15:44.995 --> 1:15:47.131
The diamonds are gonna
get you killed.

1:15:48.098 --> 1:15:49.433
And is it worth it?

1:15:51.202 --> 1:15:52.403
No.

1:15:54.205 --> 1:15:56.972
But making you fail,
that's something I would die for.

1:15:56.974 --> 1:16:00.044
- Shoot her.
- We should just take her and go.

1:16:01.045 --> 1:16:03.781
She'll talk... eventually.

1:16:05.082 --> 1:16:08.517
You know,
I don't think she will.

1:16:08.519 --> 1:16:12.387
We need to reassess,
and we need to clear the board.

1:16:12.389 --> 1:16:14.256
I don't want any loose ends.
Shoot her.

1:16:14.258 --> 1:16:15.791
No, we need
to get out of here now.

1:16:15.793 --> 1:16:16.927
This is not the time
or the place for this.

1:16:18.095 --> 1:16:19.396
What did you say?

1:16:20.931 --> 1:16:24.034
I'm just saying that
I think that there is...

1:16:27.805 --> 1:16:30.305
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

1:16:30.307 --> 1:16:31.976
Don't listen to her.

1:16:33.210 --> 1:16:35.377
For what he did to you.

1:16:35.379 --> 1:16:37.214
For what he made you become.

1:16:38.415 --> 1:16:39.950
Magdalena...

1:16:42.486 --> 1:16:43.988
do it.

1:16:45.089 --> 1:16:46.290
Do it.

1:16:47.124 --> 1:16:48.259
Do it!

1:17:01.839 --> 1:17:04.008
I love you like a daughter,
you know that.

1:17:05.242 --> 1:17:06.877
Like a daughter.

1:17:12.283 --> 1:17:14.318
I'm sorry.

1:17:25.462 --> 1:17:27.896
Okay, last chance.

1:17:27.898 --> 1:17:30.065
What did you do to her?

1:17:30.067 --> 1:17:32.868
What did I do to her?
I saved her. Okay.

1:17:32.870 --> 1:17:35.871
Her family dead,
she was on the streets

1:17:35.873 --> 1:17:38.073
and I gave her everything.
What do you care?

1:17:38.075 --> 1:17:40.042
You turned her into a weapon.

1:17:40.044 --> 1:17:41.543
I saved her from
becoming a corpse,

1:17:41.545 --> 1:17:43.380
and you made me
shoot her!

1:17:51.422 --> 1:17:53.390
I really didn't want it
to end this way, Kate.

1:18:04.501 --> 1:18:05.969
I'm okay.

1:18:20.652 --> 1:18:23.520
I come in here and save
your arses again, huh?

1:18:39.069 --> 1:18:40.504
Take a seat there.

1:18:45.542 --> 1:18:47.644
You left 'em in
a bleedin' bush?

1:18:50.247 --> 1:18:52.082
- Thought you were smarter than that.
- Yeah?

1:18:53.617 --> 1:18:55.018
I was hoping Theo would too.

1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:57.154
You all right?

1:18:58.622 --> 1:19:00.624
I take no chances anymore.

1:19:01.726 --> 1:19:04.159
It's twist after twist
with you, huh?

1:19:04.161 --> 1:19:06.328
It's like screwing on
a bottle cap.

1:19:06.330 --> 1:19:08.063
Ow, it hurts to laugh.

1:19:08.065 --> 1:19:09.466
Here, gimme a look at those.

1:19:19.510 --> 1:19:21.111
You took a chance on me.

1:19:21.713 --> 1:19:23.447
You didn't have to.

1:19:24.548 --> 1:19:26.651
It wasn't a chance,
it was a choice.

1:19:27.451 --> 1:19:28.552
You made one too.

1:19:31.121 --> 1:19:33.155
Don't worry, we're good.

1:19:33.157 --> 1:19:35.624
That was beautiful,
just gorgeous,

1:19:35.626 --> 1:19:39.127
but, uh, Mag's just been shot,
I'm bleeding outside a church,

1:19:39.129 --> 1:19:41.163
and you're holding
a bag of diamonds.

1:19:41.165 --> 1:19:43.632
- So... I think we better skedaddle.
- Yeah.

1:19:43.634 --> 1:19:45.335
There's a couple of things
I wanna take care of.

1:20:28.245 --> 1:20:29.747
<i>Surprised to see me?</i>

1:20:31.448 --> 1:20:34.017
<i>Kiss my bollocks,
you baldy prick.</i>

1:20:42.493 --> 1:20:43.761
Game over.

1:20:57.174 --> 1:20:59.978
- To Grayson.
- That cocky bastard.

1:21:07.217 --> 1:21:08.751
Wasn't too hard
to find the painting?

1:21:08.753 --> 1:21:10.454
Oh, I slipped through.

1:21:12.724 --> 1:21:14.224
Thank you.

1:21:21.799 --> 1:21:23.600
You got something for me?

1:21:57.334 --> 1:21:59.269
- Done.
- That's it?

1:22:00.337 --> 1:22:01.471
That's it.

1:22:03.340 --> 1:22:05.375
Thanks for saving me a step.

1:22:06.610 --> 1:22:08.278
Never liked that guy.

1:22:11.248 --> 1:22:12.482
I'll be in touch.

1:22:22.827 --> 1:22:25.228
So... what's next?

1:22:26.196 --> 1:22:28.330
We all betray each other,

1:22:28.332 --> 1:22:30.933
Kate turns out to be
Grayson's daughter.

1:22:30.935 --> 1:22:33.604
We'll whip off the mask,
and it's Scooby Doo?

1:22:34.906 --> 1:22:36.340
Maybe.

1:22:37.441 --> 1:22:38.743
But first...

1:22:39.911 --> 1:22:41.511
you ever been to Italy?

1:23:29.694 --> 1:23:31.294
How's that?

1:23:33.463 --> 1:23:37.534
I think just a little bit...

1:23:39.636 --> 1:23:41.371
All about the angles.

1:23:44.608 --> 1:23:45.875
It's good?

1:23:45.877 --> 1:23:48.512
Just a little...
Just a little bit

1:23:48.980 --> 1:23:50.713
to the right.

1:23:50.715 --> 1:23:53.581
Oh, a touch...

1:23:53.583 --> 1:23:54.886
There.

1:23:57.889 --> 1:23:59.724
I think it suits the place.

1:24:02.292 --> 1:24:03.861
It's like having a painting
of your face.

1:24:05.730 --> 1:24:09.031
Where are we going next?

1:24:09.033 --> 1:24:10.866
Italy.
We already decided in the last meet.

1:24:10.868 --> 1:24:11.903
Remember?
