00:12.560 --> 00:13.920
<i>Thirty-forty.</i>

00:15.880 --> 00:17.280
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:22.040
<i>You step on that court,</i>

00:22.120 --> 00:23.800
<i>time stops.</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:29.560
<i>You are out there by yourself.</i>

00:31.560 --> 00:34.560
<i>Your heart starts beating faster.</i>

00:36.360 --> 00:39.600
<i>And that little voice in your head</i>
<i>doesn't stop.</i>

00:42.280 --> 00:45.160
<i>Suddenly I feel the fear coming.</i>

00:47.680 --> 00:50.240
<i>This is the one we were waiting for.</i>

00:52.280 --> 00:55.360
<i>And the atmosphere is electric.</i>

01:06.160 --> 01:07.760
<i>It's a break point.</i>

01:18.240 --> 01:21.040
<i>Oh, that is filthy tennis.</i>

01:21.960 --> 01:24.800
Let's do a Netflix series and shit.
Let's get it, baby.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.560
<i>Four Grand Slams.</i>

01:28.640 --> 01:30.320
<i>Hundreds of tournaments.</i>

01:30.400 --> 01:34.520
<i>Competing all over</i>
<i>the world for a place in history.</i>

01:35.240 --> 01:39.600
<i>The last decade, we've been</i>
<i>blessed with an era of greatness.</i>

01:40.200 --> 01:43.440
<i>Roger, Rafa, Serena, Novak.</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:47.440
We can't just wait for them to retire.
We need to find a way to try to win.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.120
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

01:52.200 --> 01:56.440
<i>We may finally</i>
<i>be witnessing a major shift in the game.</i>

01:57.320 --> 02:00.040
<i>So we wonder who will take their place.</i>

02:01.520 --> 02:04.520
Like, who the hell is this guy?

02:08.280 --> 02:09.960
<i>I wanna be number one in the world.</i>

02:10.040 --> 02:11.640
<i>I wanna know what that</i>
<i>feels like to win a title.</i>

02:11.720 --> 02:15.320
I know what I'm capable of
and I know how much work I've put in.

02:16.039 --> 02:19.960
<i>Nothing in the whole world</i>
<i>can beat that feeling of winning.</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:21.760
You're chasing that all the time.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.360
Don't fuck it up.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.480
<i>The first African woman in the Open era</i>

02:28.560 --> 02:30.600
<i>to reach the Wimbledon final.</i>

02:30.680 --> 02:32.680
<i>There is so much pressure.</i>

02:33.480 --> 02:36.960
There's thousands of people that are
gonna watch you and write about you.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.480
I think the hardest thing in sports
is expectation.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.200
<i>Everybody chokes.</i>

02:46.840 --> 02:51.960
<i>And what defines greatness is the ability</i>
<i>to manage these big moments.</i>

02:54.520 --> 02:57.320
<i>But is this new generation up to it?</i>

02:58.960 --> 03:02.720
<i>Can you play every point</i>
<i>like your life depends on it?</i>

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
Ow.

03:03.880 --> 03:04.760
The pain is unmatched.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.080
<i>There's a lot at stake.</i>
<i>This is fucking bonkers.</i>

03:07.720 --> 03:09.920
<i>It's competition. It's war.</i>

03:10.000 --> 03:11.040
Yeah!

03:11.120 --> 03:12.920
<i>It's what you worked</i>
<i>your whole life to do.</i>

03:15.520 --> 03:16.680
It's now or never.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.360
<i>Fasten your seat belts,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

03:20.440 --> 03:21.680
<i>Let's do it.</i>

03:36.480 --> 03:40.280
<i>Hello and welcome</i>
<i>to the Australian Open 2022.</i>

03:40.360 --> 03:43.120
<i>The tennis season</i>
<i>kicks off here at Melbourne Park,</i>

03:43.200 --> 03:44.960
<i>home of the Australian Open.</i>

03:46.880 --> 03:48.320
<i>Tennis is back.</i>

03:48.400 --> 03:51.520
<i>The first slam of the year</i>
<i>is always fresh with hope.</i>

03:52.320 --> 03:56.880
Grand Slam. Oh my God.
It's a tennis player's dream.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.600
The tennis season takes place
across nearly every continent,

04:00.680 --> 04:04.200
but our four Grand Slams
are the biggest events on the circuit.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.200
<i>They're the most prestigious.</i>

04:09.120 --> 04:10.800
<i>They offer the most prize money.</i>

04:12.080 --> 04:14.360
<i>They are the ones</i>
<i>that everybody tunes into.</i>

04:16.320 --> 04:20.080
It's all about the energy.
The people, the noise, the crowd.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.360
See? I get goosebumps. It's so exciting.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.560
Grand Slams in tennis are different.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.040
<i>They're big, they're historic.</i>
<i>The ultimate goal.</i>

04:33.800 --> 04:35.920
Whether it's good,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.120
bad or beautiful…

04:39.840 --> 04:41.840
it's all there, it's part of history.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.200
<i>In this game, there's nowhere to hide.</i>

04:45.280 --> 04:48.960
It's physically very taxing.
It's mentally very taxing.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.920
<i>You know, and sometimes…</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:53.520
Hell, yeah, it's frustrating.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.040
You cannot be serious!

04:55.920 --> 04:59.400
<i>Now it's down. Might as well break it.</i>

05:10.120 --> 05:12.200
<i>This year there's a shortlist of guys</i>

05:12.280 --> 05:15.920
<i>that are coming up to try and win a slam</i>
<i>and grab hold of the sport.</i>

05:17.960 --> 05:20.800
Everybody's trying to win a Grand Slam.
Why not me?

05:25.240 --> 05:28.080
-How are you feeling about tomorrow?
-Pretty good.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.000
-I'm really excited to play.
-I'm excited too.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.760
<i>It's always pushing to the limit.</i>

05:36.680 --> 05:38.560
I know that I want to lift a big trophy.

05:40.160 --> 05:44.400
<i>Everyone's coming into the Open</i>
<i>talking about these contenders.</i>

05:44.480 --> 05:47.560
<i>But there's one hometown guy</i>
<i>who might have the most talent,</i>

05:47.640 --> 05:50.400
<i>but no one is really</i>
<i>expecting anything from him.</i>

06:07.600 --> 06:09.960
<i>Tell me about Nick Kyrgios.</i>

06:10.040 --> 06:11.960
Ah.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.920
I could say a lot about Nick.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.600
He's probably the most talented
tennis player from our generation.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.880
<i>He's one of the only</i>
<i>players to have beaten the big three.</i>

06:25.960 --> 06:28.800
<i>Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic…</i>

06:28.880 --> 06:30.480
<i>He's conquered them all.</i>

06:30.560 --> 06:34.120
I think he's the most talented tennis
player I've seen in ten years.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.000
<i>International tennis</i>
<i>has a new bad boy.</i>

06:40.080 --> 06:42.000
<i>"Bad boy of tennis."</i>

06:42.080 --> 06:45.760
<i>…today took his</i>
<i>brattish behavior to a whole new level.</i>

06:47.880 --> 06:51.120
He's not a bad guy, but he becomes
a devil when he enters the court.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.120
<i>A once-in-a-generation talent,</i>

07:00.200 --> 07:04.240
<i>but after ten years in the game,</i>
<i>will he ever live up to his potential?</i>

07:11.640 --> 07:14.080
Just touching down in Melbourne, yeah?

07:14.160 --> 07:16.720
On our jet. Pilot, give me the thumbs up.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.800
-All good.
-All good, buddy. All good.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.120
Your mum just messaged me saying,
"Morning, Horses."

07:31.200 --> 07:34.880
"Give Nico a big, big hug for me.
Miss him, kiss, kiss, kiss."

07:34.960 --> 07:39.160
-Why wouldn't she message me?
-I don't know. This is what happens.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.800
Thank you.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.600
<i>Nick and I just… We were almost</i>
<i>inseparable in the early days.</i>

07:47.120 --> 07:50.600
We clicked and haven't looked back.
We've been best friends ever since.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.080
Are you still training today?

07:53.160 --> 07:56.320
I might.
We'll see what the weather's like.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.480
<i>The majority of my job</i>
<i>is making sure he feels good.</i>

07:59.560 --> 08:03.800
I think it's pretty important for someone
who doesn't have a trainer or a coach.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.440
I'll pick you up again later
if I'm going to go play tennis.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.480
-Sure.
-Yeah.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.320
<i>We've been together</i>
<i>about two and a half months.</i>

08:12.400 --> 08:16.040
<i>We met online and we've been</i>
<i>hanging out every day since.</i>

08:16.840 --> 08:20.000
He's not as crazy
as everyone thinks he is.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.960
I'm excited.
I want to enjoy watching you play.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.840
I've never really watched
a tennis game in my life.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.200
So, yeah, this is all new for me.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.120
<i>During a slam,</i>
<i>you have to go in prepared</i>

08:37.200 --> 08:40.320
<i>to play every match</i>
<i>in pretty extreme conditions.</i>

08:40.400 --> 08:42.480
-I really need a hug.
-Oh.

08:42.559 --> 08:46.840
Australia in January feels like you're
playing in a hairdryer for six hours.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.320
<i>Australia is such</i>
<i>a sports-mad country.</i>

08:51.400 --> 08:54.040
So that's a lot of pressure
for the Australian players

08:54.120 --> 08:56.000
when they play in Melbourne.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.760
<i>People want to see him succeed.</i>

08:59.840 --> 09:03.600
<i>I think that really weighs on him more</i>
<i>heavily in Australia than anywhere else.</i>

09:04.200 --> 09:07.400
<i>This is gonna be his first tournament</i>
<i>since 2021 US Open.</i>

09:08.400 --> 09:10.280
He hasn't played tennis for months.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.480
<i>He's like a part-time player.</i>

09:13.800 --> 09:17.360
He doesn't play that often.
He takes months off at a time.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.040
It's like a hobby.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.800
<i>I don't know if it's the pressure</i>

09:21.880 --> 09:25.720
<i>or he's falling out of love with the game,</i>
<i>but if he drops down the rankings,</i>

09:25.800 --> 09:28.120
<i>he won't qualify</i>
<i>for the major tournaments.</i>

09:28.200 --> 09:29.560
<i>One of the big questions is,</i>

09:29.640 --> 09:33.080
<i>"Is he still going to be playing</i>
<i>the sport this time next year?"</i>

09:36.120 --> 09:37.400
Welcome back, brother.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.200
It's always nice to be back, you know.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.080
I don't know
if this is going to be the last time.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.920
Nothing good lasts forever, yeah?

09:50.520 --> 09:53.520
<i>My tennis career depends</i>
<i>on how I play this year.</i>

09:56.520 --> 10:00.080
People really don't understand
how different I go about my tennis

10:00.160 --> 10:03.960
or my life or my career
compared to every other tennis player.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.640
<i>I've barely played for ten or eleven</i>
<i>weeks of the year,</i>

10:08.720 --> 10:11.320
<i>but I'm hitting the ball as good as ever.</i>

10:12.120 --> 10:14.360
<i>I definitely feel my level is there.</i>

10:16.040 --> 10:20.760
He doesn't want it! He does not want it!

10:21.920 --> 10:23.480
What a point!

10:31.440 --> 10:33.200
-How are you going?
-What do you think?

10:33.280 --> 10:37.080
-Camera's on you right now.
-Really good. Not bad.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.600
I don't know how you're out in the heat.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.880
-Sorry. I'm so sweaty.
-No, it's okay.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.680
How are you feeling?

10:48.760 --> 10:50.720
I feel okay. It's just like…

10:51.720 --> 10:53.600
I'm just taking it as it comes
at the moment.

10:53.680 --> 10:58.160
You know, like, I don't know how many
Aus opens, realistically, are coming.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.800
So, like, I'm just soaking it all in.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.680
Take one day at a time.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.600
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.
It's terrible.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.000
-Yeah.
-Try and actually enjoy it.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.120
Yeah.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.640
<i>We bring you</i>
<i>all the action from Rod Laver Arena.</i>

11:15.720 --> 11:21.440
<i>All of the color, all of the excitement</i>
<i>of day one of Australian Open 2022.</i>

11:24.840 --> 11:28.280
<i>At the start of round one,</i>
<i>there's 128 men.</i>

11:31.280 --> 11:32.800
<i>And 128 women.</i>

11:37.840 --> 11:40.480
<i>All playing knockout rounds</i>
<i>over two weeks.</i>

11:42.320 --> 11:45.000
In tennis, it is "eat what you kill."

11:45.880 --> 11:47.280
-Yes!

11:47.360 --> 11:50.200
<i>Every round a player wins,</i>
<i>they earn a cash prize.</i>

11:51.000 --> 11:55.080
If you're not winning matches, you're not
making money. That's the bottom line.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.000
<i>The way that</i>
<i>the tennis scoring system works,</i>

12:02.080 --> 12:04.480
<i>matches can turn around on a dime.</i>

12:07.800 --> 12:10.400
<i>Six games wins a set.</i>

12:11.160 --> 12:13.640
<i>It's best of three sets for the women.</i>

12:14.240 --> 12:16.160
<i>Game, set, match.</i>

12:16.240 --> 12:18.600
<i>The men play best of five.</i>

12:20.000 --> 12:24.160
<i>With the Grand Slam on the line, you have</i>
<i>to be ready to go straight out the blocks.</i>

12:28.840 --> 12:30.760
A commentator on ESPN today

12:30.840 --> 12:33.840
said he heard rumblings
this is your last year on tour.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.160
Is that accurate?

12:35.240 --> 12:37.840
I don't know. Like, I don't know.

12:37.920 --> 12:42.840
I'll probably be planning to play, but I'm
just thinking about tonight and tomorrow.

12:45.600 --> 12:50.280
<i>Now it is time for</i>
<i>an Aussie to take to center stage here.</i>

12:50.360 --> 12:53.760
<i>Taking on the qualifier</i>
<i>Liam Broady of the UK.</i>

12:54.480 --> 12:57.240
If you've never seen a tennis score
before, it can be confusing.

12:58.680 --> 13:03.160
It's a five-set match,
but in every set, six games makes a set.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.920
So it's basically first to six.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.480
<i>The danger for Nick</i>
<i>is that he hasn't played lately.</i>

13:09.560 --> 13:11.520
<i>And you're coming in cold</i>

13:11.600 --> 13:14.200
<i>against somebody</i>
<i>who's au fait with the conditions.</i>

13:14.280 --> 13:17.880
<i>Perhaps a potential</i>
<i>banana peel here for Kyrgios.</i>

13:17.960 --> 13:20.720
<i>Surely, it cannot be ideal</i>
<i>for this first round.</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:22.640
<i>It'll be a test.</i>

13:28.640 --> 13:29.720
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.720
Liam Broady,
my fucking competitor right here.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.880
It's gonna be a good one.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.240
<i>From the United</i>
<i>Kingdom, please welcome Liam Broady!</i>

13:42.680 --> 13:43.920
<i>From Australia,</i>

13:44.640 --> 13:46.680
<i>Nick Kyrgios!</i>

13:46.760 --> 13:49.280
<i>Mr. Box Office himself.</i>

13:50.040 --> 13:53.440
<i>He promised us a good show</i>
<i>and hopefully he can deliver.</i>

13:53.520 --> 13:55.760
<i>Thank you. Players are ready.</i>

13:56.480 --> 13:59.000
<i>I cannot wait for this one to unfold.</i>

13:59.760 --> 14:01.320
<i>Play.</i>

14:25.800 --> 14:28.800
<i>King Kyrgios is in the house.</i>

14:28.880 --> 14:31.160
<i>It's insane</i>
<i>what he's able to do on the court.</i>

14:32.600 --> 14:34.320
I wish I would've had his talent.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.360
<i>My serve is my biggest weapon.</i>

14:43.160 --> 14:46.280
His serve is so good. It is so good.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.960
Let's go, come on.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.000
<i>He can dictate the point</i>

14:51.080 --> 14:53.120
<i>by hitting a serve</i>
<i>where he needs to hit it.</i>

14:59.280 --> 15:01.000
<i>Game, first set, Kyrgios.</i>

15:03.560 --> 15:05.280
<i>Nick is different.</i>

15:05.360 --> 15:08.560
<i>He keeps you entertained,</i>
<i>on the edge of your seat.</i>

15:13.920 --> 15:18.200
<i>Oh, that is filthy tennis.</i>

15:19.040 --> 15:20.840
<i>What is going on?</i>

15:20.920 --> 15:23.640
<i>You're gonna see him do</i>
<i>the most ridiculous trick shots</i>.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.120
<i>If you want an experience, you watch Nick.</i>

15:26.200 --> 15:30.360
<i>Already sending the locals into a frenzy.</i>

15:30.440 --> 15:33.080
<i>Kyrgios leads two sets to love.</i>

15:39.720 --> 15:42.600
<i>He hits a shot</i>
<i>and starts throwing up his hands.</i>

15:44.960 --> 15:46.480
People are like, "Yeah."

15:47.280 --> 15:48.800
<i>The crowd's involved.</i>

15:49.840 --> 15:51.600
<i>The chair umpire is involved.</i>

15:52.600 --> 15:55.880
<i>It's cool. You just don't see that</i>
<i>from any other player.</i>

15:56.560 --> 15:58.280
<i>The people follow Kyrgios.</i>

15:58.360 --> 16:00.720
<i>They're incredibly loud</i>
<i>and create an atmosphere.</i>

16:02.040 --> 16:03.720
<i>And he plays it to perfection.</i>

16:06.840 --> 16:10.160
<i>Kyrgios leads five games to three.</i>

16:14.040 --> 16:15.800
<i>Pretty crazy out there.</i>

16:17.320 --> 16:20.120
It's a very difficult atmosphere
to try and handle.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.760
<i>He orchestrates the crowd. He's incredible</i>
<i>at getting them behind him.</i>

16:24.840 --> 16:27.200
<i>And he plays better for it.</i>

16:27.280 --> 16:29.040
<i>Match point here.</i>

16:33.240 --> 16:37.640
<i>Game, set, match Kyrgios,</i>
<i>6-4, 6-4, 6-3.</i>

16:37.720 --> 16:41.200
<i>Kyrgios is through in straights.</i>

16:42.960 --> 16:45.200
<i>What a way to shut the gates.</i>

16:45.280 --> 16:49.240
<i>And he sets up</i>
<i>a mouth-watering second round</i>

16:50.080 --> 16:51.800
<i>with Daniil Medvédev.</i>

16:51.880 --> 16:56.480
I don't know what the fuck is going on
with that crowd. They are insane, yeah?

16:57.160 --> 16:59.080
They're like a zoo in there.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.920
<i>Now he's got</i>
<i>the number two player in the world.</i>

17:11.000 --> 17:14.400
<i>Daniil Medvédev is one</i>
<i>of the most disciplined guys</i>

17:14.480 --> 17:17.160
<i>that we've seen in the game</i>
<i>for a very long time.</i>

17:17.240 --> 17:20.160
I've got to give a big advantage
to Medvédev in this match

17:20.240 --> 17:22.839
given the amount of tennis
Nick has played.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.520
<i>I'm interested to see what is his level.</i>

17:25.599 --> 17:27.839
<i>It's not easy</i>
<i>when you don't play a lot of tennis.</i>

17:27.920 --> 17:30.839
He's going to try to pump himself up.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.600
<i>I'll do my preparation.</i>
<i>It's not going to be easy for him.</i>

17:40.720 --> 17:43.280
-I feel good right now.
-Your hips are tight.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.800
As far as your hip range goes,
it's pretty good.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.840
You alright?

17:52.600 --> 17:57.200
In reality, I should be getting this every
day, but I'm just a different cat.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.120
You've never done anything standard.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.800
You have to balance the mental
and the physical.

18:04.880 --> 18:09.120
Because if you did that grind every day,
you'd be so unhappy.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.520
<i>I think everyone knows I'm capable</i>
<i>of beating anyone on any given day,</i>

18:24.600 --> 18:27.520
<i>but kind of depends on how I'm feeling.</i>

18:29.200 --> 18:31.160
<i>That's why I have to do it my way.</i>

18:38.520 --> 18:41.000
<i>Stunning conditions for tennis fans</i>

18:41.080 --> 18:44.680
<i>as we kick off second-round action</i>
<i>at the Australian Open.</i>

18:45.520 --> 18:50.240
<i>With half the draw eliminated,</i>
<i>only 64 men and 64 women remain.</i>

18:55.880 --> 18:58.480
<i>Each stage is a battle for survival.</i>

19:02.040 --> 19:04.160
<i>Whether you love him or hate him,</i>

19:04.240 --> 19:07.280
<i>he's always entertaining, Nick Kyrgios.</i>

19:07.360 --> 19:11.080
<i>It's a second-round</i>
<i>matchup that we were all hoping for.</i>

19:15.200 --> 19:19.480
<i>Medvédev is ruthless.</i>
<i>He's patient. He's a winning machine.</i>

19:19.560 --> 19:23.040
<i>Kyrgios is engaging. Volatile.</i>

19:23.120 --> 19:25.240
<i>A slayer of seeds.</i>

19:32.520 --> 19:34.520
<i>Nick Kyrgios to serve.</i>

19:34.600 --> 19:36.160
<i>Ready. Play.</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:49.120
-<i>Game, Kyrgios.</i>

19:50.880 --> 19:53.840
<i>First game goes</i>
<i>to Kyrgios. He's off to a good start.</i>

20:06.760 --> 20:09.080
<i>Medvédev's really come out firing.</i>

20:12.120 --> 20:13.640
<i>He's under the pump here.</i>

20:15.880 --> 20:18.640
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

20:20.800 --> 20:23.440
<i>Straight nitro from Kyrgios.</i>

20:24.000 --> 20:26.120
<i>This is what they came to see.</i>

20:27.880 --> 20:31.280
<i>This battle is well and truly joint now</i>
<i>at four a piece.</i>

20:34.680 --> 20:36.200
Out.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.240
Can you please stop screaming
while I'm fucking serving?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.240
<i>Obscenity by Mr. Kyrgios.</i>

20:42.320 --> 20:45.880
Will you tell them to quiet down
before my serve? Cool.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.560
<i>Apologies for the colorful language.</i>

20:49.840 --> 20:53.280
<i>I lose my shit 'cause of little</i>
<i>things happening out there.</i>

20:54.560 --> 20:56.240
Come on. Take your time.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.080
<i>I've got such a short fuse.</i>

21:01.400 --> 21:03.000
<i>It's almost like a habit.</i>

21:05.360 --> 21:08.240
<i>Watching him play tennis,</i>
<i>you get this anxious feeling.</i>

21:10.920 --> 21:13.280
<i>So much pressure and so many emotions.</i>

21:14.480 --> 21:16.720
<i>Game and first set, Medvédev.</i>

21:16.800 --> 21:18.640
<i>By seven games to six.</i>

21:19.640 --> 21:23.200
<i>The reality of tennis</i>
<i>at the highest level.</i>

21:23.280 --> 21:25.760
You have to go there and take it.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.360
Let's go, come on.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.800
<i>You have to be mentally there</i>
<i>the entire time.</i>

21:30.880 --> 21:33.360
<i>You cannot be inconsistent.</i>

21:34.080 --> 21:35.920
<i>You cannot have an off day.</i>

21:40.720 --> 21:42.840
<i>Game, Medvédev.</i>

21:53.960 --> 21:57.400
<i>It's just another body blow to Kyrgios.</i>

21:59.400 --> 22:03.200
<i>Medvédev proving to be</i>
<i>Kyrgios's kryptonite.</i>

22:03.280 --> 22:07.280
Listen. I don't want to talk to you.
Listen to me. Yeah?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.360
Don't scream.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.320
<i>There'll be one point</i>
<i>where he thinks he should have won.</i>

22:11.400 --> 22:13.640
<i>And then just goes bang.</i>

22:14.880 --> 22:16.840
-I couldn't care less.
-Okay.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.320
Ask anyone else.
Nobody cares about what you say.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.720
<i>Me too.</i>

22:23.800 --> 22:26.240
In the heat of the battle,
I'm two different people.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.080
Sometimes I do cross the line.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.080
That's just my passion.
That's just my emotion.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.800
Millions of people watching you.

22:38.360 --> 22:42.920
You're not playing your best.
Would you not be frustrated and angry?

22:56.240 --> 22:58.120
<i>He should have put that away.</i>

23:08.520 --> 23:10.680
<i>I have to let it out out there.</i>

23:12.480 --> 23:14.160
<i>Match point here.</i>

23:14.240 --> 23:15.960
<i>One thing is for sure.</i>

23:16.040 --> 23:20.320
<i>If things don't go his way here,</i>
<i>he has gone out with a bang.</i>

23:24.360 --> 23:28.800
<i>Daniil Medvédev takes care</i>
<i>of Nick Kyrgios.</i>

23:28.880 --> 23:32.360
<i>Three sets to one. 7-6, 6-4, 4-6…</i>

23:32.440 --> 23:34.440
<i>Simply too good.</i>

23:34.520 --> 23:38.680
<i>A mental giant</i>
<i>who takes Kyrgios down in four sets.</i>

23:40.800 --> 23:44.000
<i>Not sure how much more</i>
<i>Nick is going to be sticking around.</i>

23:44.960 --> 23:47.320
<i>What do you make</i>
<i>of what you've seen tonight?</i>

23:48.840 --> 23:52.600
<i>Look, I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't know if anyone knows.</i>

23:52.680 --> 23:55.560
<i>He still plays as well as ever,</i>
<i>doesn't he?</i>

23:58.560 --> 24:00.680
<i>And is this a last goodbye?</i>

24:03.120 --> 24:05.400
<i>It may very well be.</i>

24:05.480 --> 24:08.600
<i>He has been one hell of an entertainer.</i>

24:08.680 --> 24:11.400
<i>But has he maximized that talent?</i>

24:11.480 --> 24:16.040
<i>That will always be the question</i>
<i>that hangs over Kyrgios.</i>

24:18.080 --> 24:20.200
<i>Melbourne Park says farewell.</i>

24:23.200 --> 24:25.560
[sad music playing

24:29.800 --> 24:33.920
-You should be fucking proud.
-Yeah, you were amazing.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.080
You played very solidly.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.320
<i>I worry about him every day.</i>

24:59.400 --> 25:00.920
<i>Every day.</i>

25:01.800 --> 25:07.000
<i>Because he's gone through</i>
<i>some really unhappy times.</i>

25:08.080 --> 25:09.720
I'm a real chatterbox.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.040
Chee!

25:13.840 --> 25:15.560
<i>He was a beautiful baby.</i>

25:15.640 --> 25:19.200
<i>He had all these curls.</i>
<i>I thought he looked like a little girl.</i>

25:22.560 --> 25:24.280
<i>He was a chubby little boy.</i>

25:25.400 --> 25:28.600
<i>Around seven is when</i>
<i>he had his first lesson.</i>

25:30.080 --> 25:31.800
<i>I didn't know how good I was.</i>

25:31.880 --> 25:33.480
That's the shot.

25:34.880 --> 25:38.280
<i>When I was about 17,</i>
<i>I just had a growth spurt.</i>

25:38.360 --> 25:41.000
<i>All of a sudden</i>
<i>I started sliding and moving.</i>

25:41.920 --> 25:45.320
I was like, I've been blessed.
And then things got quite serious.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.640
<i>I was 19. I had my break out at Wimbledon</i>
<i>and then that was it.</i>

25:55.200 --> 25:56.520
<i>My life changed.</i>

25:58.200 --> 26:02.840
<i>The 19-year-old beat</i>
<i>the almost unbeatable Rafael Nadal.</i>

26:02.920 --> 26:06.240
<i>It's one of those sporting stories</i>
<i>that becomes an instant legend.</i>

26:06.320 --> 26:10.600
<i>The Australian teenager who takes on</i>
<i>the world number one and wins.</i>

26:10.680 --> 26:13.360
<i>It went from no one knowing who I was</i>

26:13.440 --> 26:15.680
<i>to people camping outside my house.</i>

26:17.200 --> 26:20.240
That match changed everything. Everything.

26:22.320 --> 26:26.840
<i>From that day forth, the expectation for</i>
<i>me to be the next big thing was massive.</i>

26:27.880 --> 26:29.720
<i>How do you tell a 19-year-old</i>

26:29.800 --> 26:33.320
<i>to deal with so much pressure</i>
<i>after beating the world number one?</i>

26:37.280 --> 26:39.560
<i>He just became aggressive.</i>

26:39.640 --> 26:43.600
<i>He was just so angry,</i>
<i>always angry at something.</i>

26:43.680 --> 26:45.600
What does that mean?

26:45.680 --> 26:47.680
-What's unsportsmanlike about it?
-Stop.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.920
-What is unsportsmanlike?
-Please stop.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.400
<i>After that, he was painted</i>
<i>as a bad boy, and then he was the villain.</i>

27:00.480 --> 27:02.960
<i>Every article, every tabloid, every person</i>

27:03.040 --> 27:05.720
<i>just wanted to have their two cents</i>

27:05.800 --> 27:07.800
<i>and tell him what a shit bloke he was.</i>

27:09.320 --> 27:13.920
<i>We even had one of our sporting legends</i>
<i>tell him to go back to where he came from.</i>

27:14.000 --> 27:15.920
Who does that? You know?

27:17.840 --> 27:21.560
<i>Racism. It was another</i>
<i>unnecessary thing to deal with.</i>

27:22.560 --> 27:23.680
<i>It hurt.</i>

27:26.520 --> 27:30.200
The first four or five years of my career,
it was so chaotic.

27:31.040 --> 27:35.240
When Horse was on tour with me,
he was just basically looking after me.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.920
He could just see my mental well-being
declining every week.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.320
My life was kind of spiraling out
of control, drinking every single night.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.520
I used to have your location on my phone.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.960
Some mornings I'd have to physically go
and find where you were,

27:52.040 --> 27:55.640
what hotel you were at,
whose house you were staying at

27:55.720 --> 27:57.960
before tournaments, before a match.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.800
-It was tough.
-I was like, "I can't keep doing this."

28:01.880 --> 28:04.600
I just had to be kinder to myself.
For my mental health,

28:04.680 --> 28:08.520
I could never be a player that played
all year round. I couldn't do that.

28:08.600 --> 28:13.040
I value my family, my close friends,
and Cossie too much

28:13.120 --> 28:15.720
to put tennis in front of that anymore.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.880
I don't think that's healthy.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.480
I don't have any expectations
now in my matches.

28:20.560 --> 28:24.280
I want to go out there,
have fun, and take the pressure off.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.320
Then we can kind of live
more of a normal life.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.480
It's much better like this,
that's for sure.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.320
<i>Wherever he goes,</i>
<i>drama does seem to follow.</i>

28:37.400 --> 28:40.200
<i>Kyrgios and fellow Aussie,</i>
<i>Thanasi Kokkinakis,</i>

28:40.280 --> 28:42.480
<i>have teamed up in the doubles.</i>

28:42.560 --> 28:45.320
<i>To come up short against Medvédev</i>
<i>was heartbreaking,</i>

28:45.400 --> 28:48.560
<i>but I'm gonna play doubles</i>
<i>with one of my best friends</i>

28:48.640 --> 28:50.200
<i>and just have a bit of fun.</i>

28:51.760 --> 28:54.280
<i>It's not just about the singles.</i>

28:54.360 --> 28:56.760
<i>There's a Grand Slam up for grabs</i>
<i>in the doubles.</i>

28:59.560 --> 29:01.760
<i>Game, set, match…</i>

29:01.840 --> 29:04.400
<i>Matches are best</i>
<i>of three sets, not five.</i>

29:06.240 --> 29:09.880
<i>But being a Grand Slam,</i>
<i>the stakes are massive.</i>

29:13.800 --> 29:16.880
We are guaranteed to be entertained
this afternoon at Melbourne Park

29:16.960 --> 29:18.160
when these two hit the court.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.600
<i>I speak of Nick Kyrgios and also Thanasi</i>
<i>Kokkinakis. They're the best of mates.</i>

29:22.680 --> 29:25.080
<i>They're putting on a show</i>
<i>here at the practice courts.</i>

29:30.120 --> 29:33.080
-One more, sorry.
-Premature. We're used to it.

29:35.360 --> 29:39.160
That guy has got so many fucking kids
running around, for sure.

29:42.520 --> 29:47.320
Give it some. You're the guy
with the biggest forehand on tour.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.640
<i>We were nine when I met Nick.</i>

29:53.720 --> 29:57.760
<i>He was this big dude,</i>
<i>wearing all NBA gear pretty much.</i>

29:57.840 --> 30:00.320
Oh, what was that?

30:01.120 --> 30:03.280
He was bigger than everyone
he was playing against.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.680
He was loud.
He was like what he is now, to be honest.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.400
What is that, bro? What is that?

30:09.360 --> 30:12.360
<i>We get along really well</i>
<i>and we're both very competitive.</i>

30:12.440 --> 30:14.840
Oh, my goodness.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.400
We're not just together
because we're good at tennis

30:17.480 --> 30:19.280
and we play well on court together.

30:21.080 --> 30:26.120
<i>We spend shitloads of times off the court</i>
<i>just talking rubbish with each other.</i>

30:28.280 --> 30:31.960
<i>Having each other's friendship</i>
<i>and company is everything.</i>

30:32.040 --> 30:35.200
When you have a close bond with someone,
you know what makes them tick.

30:38.720 --> 30:42.280
<i>When I'm around Thanasi,</i>
<i>I definitely feel comfortable and at home.</i>

30:43.040 --> 30:46.920
<i>That's why we want to play doubles</i>
<i>'cause we can kind of just have fun.</i>

30:47.480 --> 30:51.920
It's a laugh and stress-free environment,
which is hard to find, to be honest.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.840
<i>Welcome to day five of the Australian Open</i>

30:55.920 --> 30:57.800
<i>at the brand new Kia Arena.</i>

31:00.880 --> 31:03.240
<i>After their first-round win,</i>

31:03.320 --> 31:08.440
<i>it would be a huge scalp if they beat</i>
<i>the world's best number-one combination.</i>

31:08.520 --> 31:10.560
<i>Please welcome, from Croatia,</i>

31:10.640 --> 31:13.680
<i>Nikola Mectić and Mate Pavić!</i>

31:13.760 --> 31:16.680
<i>These two guys,</i>
<i>Wimbledon and Olympic champions,</i>

31:16.760 --> 31:18.760
<i>have won everything on offer.</i>

31:22.200 --> 31:26.920
<i>And, from Australia,</i>
<i>Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios.</i>

31:27.000 --> 31:29.760
<i>Two quality singles players</i>

31:29.840 --> 31:32.320
<i>up against a well-rehearsed doubles team.</i>

31:34.800 --> 31:39.320
<i>In Australia, people are snacking</i>
<i>beers, and cheering, with faces painted,</i>

31:40.040 --> 31:41.480
<i>flying flags.</i>

31:41.560 --> 31:44.280
I feel like that's what sport is.
I think tennis misses that a little.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.720
<i>It's a real</i>
<i>festival atmosphere at Kia Arena.</i>

31:58.400 --> 32:00.600
<i>We're not professional doubles guys.</i>

32:00.680 --> 32:03.040
We're single guys who play doubles.
It's different.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.000
<i>A lot of doubles players work on angles</i>

32:05.080 --> 32:07.960
<i>and "If you serve here,</i>
<i>they're going to hit it this way."</i>

32:08.600 --> 32:12.160
<i>It's very technical and that's something</i>
<i>me and Nick are so far off thinking about,</i>

32:12.240 --> 32:14.320
<i>and I think that's what makes it fun.</i>

32:15.760 --> 32:18.200
<i>A cracking pace in the first game.</i>

32:42.640 --> 32:45.080
<i>A couple of young boys having fun.</i>

32:45.160 --> 32:47.200
<i>That's what it's all about.</i>

32:47.280 --> 32:50.360
<i>After bowing out</i>
<i>to the world number two in singles,</i>

32:50.440 --> 32:53.760
<i>he and Thanasi Kokkinakis</i>
<i>are on the verge of knocking out</i>

32:53.840 --> 32:56.480
<i>the world number one doubles combination.</i>

33:01.160 --> 33:05.760
<i>They've done it. What a performance from</i>
<i>Kokkinakis and Kyrgios, childhood mates.</i>

33:06.760 --> 33:08.600
<i>They beat the best, all right.</i>

33:11.640 --> 33:13.200
What did I say?

33:13.280 --> 33:15.600
What did I say? I told you.

33:15.680 --> 33:19.160
Don't fuck with us at Kia Arena, yeah?
We move diff!

33:20.120 --> 33:21.640
Different.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.880
<i>The headlines here,</i>
<i>they're revolutionizing the sport.</i>

33:25.960 --> 33:29.280
<i>Every match they have brought the energy</i>

33:29.360 --> 33:31.080
<i>and the crowd has supported them.</i>

33:31.160 --> 33:34.520
<i>He hits great shots.</i>
<i>He hits shots that nobody else hits.</i>

33:34.600 --> 33:37.040
He's got that talent.
That's why we go crazy.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.120
Put this energy into singles as well.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.640
Love him or loathe him, you can't take
your eyes off him when he plays tennis.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.080
<i>Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis</i>

33:46.160 --> 33:49.560
<i>have taken another step</i>
<i>towards glory in the doubles.</i>

33:49.640 --> 33:52.320
<i>Let the wild ride continue.</i>

33:52.400 --> 33:55.080
<i>Kyrgios and Kokkinakis</i>
<i>through to the quarters.</i>

33:55.760 --> 33:57.520
He does well on the team format,

33:57.600 --> 33:59.840
and whether
it's because of the camaraderie

33:59.920 --> 34:02.280
or because the pressure is cut in half.

34:02.360 --> 34:06.240
The Special K's have taken
Australian Open crowds on the wildest ride

34:06.320 --> 34:08.040
in the tournament's history.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.719
<i>And the greatest show goes on!</i>

34:15.440 --> 34:17.400
<i>We're here to see Kyrgios play.</i>

34:19.440 --> 34:20.719
Go, Nick!

34:21.400 --> 34:25.520
Young people are talking about tennis.
I say, "Go Special K's."

34:25.600 --> 34:26.679
Special K's.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.120
<i>They're called</i>
<i>the Special K's. It makes sense.</i>

34:29.199 --> 34:31.880
Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis
have become

34:31.960 --> 34:34.760
the "cereal killers"
of the Australian Open doubles draw.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.159
Hey, I'm Nick, nice to meet you.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.679
-I'm Costeen.
-You're beautiful.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.360
-Are you a famous tennis player?
-We play this game all the time.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.639
You're handsome.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.960
-Am I?
-Yeah.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.560
I appreciate that.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.080
-I've never--
-Man's getting older.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.800
I am.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.480
This is our best run
in a Grand Slam ever.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.840
I'll do everything I can tonight.
Get a good rest. Recover. Train.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.920
-Listen to me, bro.
-I'm impressed.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.160
I think we've got a good shot at winning.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.520
<i>Some of the loudest</i>
<i>applause we have ever heard here.</i>

35:20.000 --> 35:22.440
<i>Good start for the Aussies.</i>

35:27.320 --> 35:30.440
<i>That's what they came to see.</i>

35:34.720 --> 35:36.400
<i>Let. First service.</i>

35:36.480 --> 35:39.760
I'm serving and it's far above the net.
How is it a let?

35:41.160 --> 35:43.520
<i>The sensors say the ball hit the net.</i>

35:43.600 --> 35:48.000
<i>If the ball does touch it, it's called</i>
<i>a let, and you retake the serve.</i>

35:49.880 --> 35:52.280
<i>Let. First service.</i>

35:52.360 --> 35:54.120
I didn't touch the net.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.640
<i>Let.</i>

35:59.200 --> 36:01.840
<i>He's just been frayed a little bit.</i>

36:05.000 --> 36:08.560
-<i>Fault!</i>
-Stop speaking before the point.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.880
<i>Getting irritated</i>
<i>with people in the crowd.</i>

36:24.320 --> 36:27.240
<i>Broken racket</i>
<i>is an automatic code violation.</i>

36:28.800 --> 36:30.840
<i>Nick's got to be careful right now.</i>

36:32.080 --> 36:35.040
<i>I was like, "Fuck,</i>
<i>I don't need him to implode here."</i>

36:35.120 --> 36:38.640
…before the serve.
How many times does that happen?

36:39.480 --> 36:41.200
It doesn't make sense.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.720
For fuck's sake.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.960
<i>If there's ever a time when I need</i>
<i>the man to stay calm, it's right here.</i>

36:48.000 --> 36:50.240
<i>This could be a long way home.</i>

36:50.320 --> 36:52.360
<i>Man, he is on the edge.</i>

36:53.720 --> 36:57.240
<i>It's like the full moon came out</i>
<i>and the werewolf showed up.</i>

37:00.240 --> 37:04.280
<i>When I start losing my head</i>
<i>a little bit, he's trying to calm me down.</i>

37:06.880 --> 37:11.520
We know how each other's feeling.
What we're thinking. It's everything.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.200
<i>We both lean on each other</i>
<i>at certain times</i>

37:16.280 --> 37:18.600
<i>and we just try and keep our energy up.</i>

37:29.960 --> 37:32.160
<i>Huge pressure moment.</i>

37:34.480 --> 37:37.080
<i>Kokkinakis comes up with the goods.</i>

37:46.520 --> 37:48.640
<i>Kokkinakis and Kyrgios</i>

37:48.720 --> 37:54.480
<i>join Ebden and Purcell</i>
<i>at the men's doubles final.</i>

37:56.480 --> 37:58.040
Unreal scenes.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.480
I'm not finished. I want to win
this fucking thing, to be honest.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.640
They're just doing a urine test.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.000
He's like 30…

38:29.720 --> 38:32.240
-Thirty mils.
-…under.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.400
He has to keep drinking water.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.600
You need to skull the water.

38:43.480 --> 38:47.600
<i>I've tried, baby. I've skulled two waters,</i>
<i>one Pepsi and one juice, I'm trying.</i>

38:49.400 --> 38:51.000
Well, just do your best.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.000
Ew. Don't show me the pee.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.240
<i>I'm doing my best.</i>
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

39:02.000 --> 39:04.760
Yeah, he needs to drink
more water because…

39:05.640 --> 39:07.760
it wasn't looking too good.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.520
-Salad?
-Yes, thank you.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.960
Are you going to do a Greek dance?

39:31.040 --> 39:32.400
Absolutely not.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.000
-Are you?
-No.

39:36.720 --> 39:40.080
<i>If you told me three years ago</i>
<i>that I'd be here,</i>

39:40.960 --> 39:42.560
<i>I wouldn't believe it.</i>

39:47.080 --> 39:49.440
<i>Tennis is an extremely lonely sport.</i>

39:51.560 --> 39:53.760
I think that's what
I struggle with the most.

39:55.360 --> 39:59.640
<i>I need to be with my family.</i>
<i>I need to have my close circle around me.</i>

40:03.520 --> 40:06.320
<i>Crashing into Saturday's final.</i>

40:06.400 --> 40:08.000
<i>As juniors, they won Wimbledon,</i>

40:08.080 --> 40:11.760
<i>as men, they've made destroying</i>
<i>the world's best combinations</i>

40:11.840 --> 40:13.600
<i>look like child's play.</i>

40:13.680 --> 40:17.120
<i>There's probably</i>
<i>going to be the largest ever audience</i>

40:17.200 --> 40:20.240
<i>for a men's doubles final</i>
<i>here in Australia…</i>

40:20.320 --> 40:23.480
-The way we trained like dogs.
-We were running off…

40:23.560 --> 40:28.000
I don't know how we trained. Now, if
I'm tired, I can't put in a good session.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.760
You feel the last few years.

40:29.840 --> 40:34.240
Back then, we were not getting more…
We were averaging three hours of sleep.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.640
I was doing four or five hours a day.

40:36.720 --> 40:41.200
You know what it was? It was because we
were so looking forward to the nights out.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.520
-Yeah.
-That's what was fueling us.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.440
Definitely reined it back a notch
since then.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.440
Definitely.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.880
However, I do want to bring it back
for a small period.

40:54.680 --> 40:57.360
<i>We've got memories</i>
<i>that go back a long time.</i>

40:58.200 --> 41:01.360
<i>Definitely seen each other</i>
<i>at our best and worst.</i>

41:06.160 --> 41:08.000
<i>We've come a long way.</i>

41:09.120 --> 41:12.640
<i>If I showed you a picture of what my</i>
<i>courts were like around my house…</i>

41:13.400 --> 41:16.320
<i>And now we're playing a Grand Slam final.</i>

41:18.560 --> 41:21.240
<i>I'm very proud of my son.</i>

41:23.200 --> 41:26.400
-Thank you.
<i>-I just want him to always be happy.</i>

41:26.480 --> 41:27.720
Ready?

41:27.800 --> 41:30.720
<i>This is the men's doubles final.</i>

41:33.440 --> 41:35.840
<i>Please welcome, from Australia,</i>

41:35.920 --> 41:39.440
<i>Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios.</i>

41:39.520 --> 41:41.800
-<i>K-squared.</i>

41:41.880 --> 41:44.640
<i>They have electrified the locals.</i>

41:44.720 --> 41:46.760
<i>They teamed up to have some fun initially,</i>

41:46.840 --> 41:50.040
<i>but think of the journey</i>
<i>they made to get here.</i>

41:50.120 --> 41:52.280
<i>They certainly showed that they can play.</i>

41:52.960 --> 41:56.040
<i>If he'd won a slam,</i>
<i>everything would go away.</i>

41:57.680 --> 42:00.360
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't want him to win a slam.

42:00.440 --> 42:03.160
<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>fascinating to see how it shakes out.</i>

42:03.240 --> 42:05.320
<i>We've done well to get to the final.</i>

42:05.400 --> 42:07.480
<i>We should be proud of ourselves.</i>

42:09.200 --> 42:11.400
<i>Ready. Play.</i>

42:19.520 --> 42:21.880
<i>Game face on.</i>

42:30.480 --> 42:33.560
<i>They've got to work for this tonight.</i>

42:36.120 --> 42:38.600
<i>Good stuff from Ebden and Purcell.</i>

42:38.680 --> 42:40.280
<i>They're dangerous. We know that.</i>

42:47.320 --> 42:50.560
<i>They have to find a way</i>
<i>to make these guys miss.</i>

42:53.560 --> 42:57.160
<i>Oof. I don't know if he's feeling</i>
<i>a little bit of tension.</i>

43:02.200 --> 43:04.400
<i>That's a Kyrgios special.</i>

43:07.440 --> 43:10.160
<i>Kyrgios reminding everyone</i>
<i>that he's the guy.</i>

43:11.400 --> 43:13.000
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

43:15.600 --> 43:17.560
<i>That's a great shot.</i>

43:17.640 --> 43:20.120
<i>To make that shot takes some talent.</i>

43:23.520 --> 43:24.960
<i>Game and first set.</i>

43:25.040 --> 43:29.040
<i>Set number one</i>
<i>goes to Kyrgios and Kokkinakis.</i>

43:30.440 --> 43:33.280
<i>Set number two. Here we go.</i>

43:47.400 --> 43:50.520
<i>There have been so many journeys together.</i>

43:53.440 --> 43:56.760
<i>What a crescendo it has come to.</i>

43:58.680 --> 44:01.040
<i>Down, but not out.</i>

44:14.000 --> 44:15.840
<i>Three championship points.</i>

44:19.160 --> 44:20.280
<i>This is it.</i>

44:21.360 --> 44:25.040
<i>With this serve,</i>
<i>serving for your first Grand Slam title.</i>

44:36.400 --> 44:38.680
<i>What a performance.</i>

44:40.640 --> 44:45.160
<i>From childhood friends</i>
<i>to Grand Slam winners.</i>

44:45.240 --> 44:49.000
<i>Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios</i>

44:49.080 --> 44:53.600
<i>are the Australian Open</i>
<i>men's doubles champions!</i>

45:04.160 --> 45:05.840
<i>Two best mates</i>

45:05.920 --> 45:09.040
<i>have just come through</i>
<i>and won the Australian Open doubles.</i>

45:09.120 --> 45:12.440
<i>They've beaten some of</i>
<i>the very best teams in the world.</i>

45:28.400 --> 45:32.520
<i>I didn't expect in this time</i>
<i>in my career to win a Grand Slam.</i>

45:35.080 --> 45:38.920
<i>When people say, "Nick Kyrgios</i>
<i>didn't achieve this or achieve that…"</i>

45:39.000 --> 45:41.840
<i>Everything that I've gone through</i>
<i>led to a Grand Slam.</i>

45:43.560 --> 45:45.520
<i>It's there. It's never leaving now.</i>

45:53.640 --> 45:56.560
<i>I feel proud of everything I've overcome.</i>

45:57.720 --> 46:00.040
<i>That whole journey to get here.</i>

46:03.400 --> 46:06.520
I'm here to show you that
I'm one of the best players in the world.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.000
I remember my first big slam.

46:14.080 --> 46:16.440
I was like, "This is it.
Like, this is happiness."

46:16.520 --> 46:20.200
<i>Oh, that is a little bit of Matteo magic!</i>

46:20.280 --> 46:23.760
<i>If it wasn't for Novak,</i>
<i>maybe I would've had a slam already.</i>

46:24.520 --> 46:25.840
Free Novak!

46:26.600 --> 46:30.840
In breaking news, the world
number one's visa has been canceled.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.440
<i>Now it's my time.</i>

46:37.280 --> 46:39.520
Wanna watch a movie
instead of tennis?

46:39.600 --> 46:42.600
When I was seven, I already
had this dream of winning a slam.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.880
<i>The thing missing from her,</i>
<i>I said, "You're too nice."</i>

46:47.960 --> 46:50.040
You got to be bitchy out there sometimes.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.120
Excellent. Excellent!

46:53.760 --> 46:56.720
The thing is, tennis really
pushes you to the limit.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.640
<i>Please welcome Rafael Nadal!</i>

47:00.920 --> 47:02.400
This sport, man.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.120
Crazy.
