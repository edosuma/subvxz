01:01.881 --> 01:05.385
<i>I can only just remember
what the sound of silence is like.</i>

01:07.453 --> 01:11.020
<i>Not the deafening
roar of nothingness.</i>

01:11.022 --> 01:14.393
<i>But the silence we associate with
the natural world in harmony...</i>

01:17.363 --> 01:21.932
<i>The silence that comes from
trees swaying in the breeze,</i>

01:21.934 --> 01:25.372
<i>the trickle of water as it makes
its way down a flowing stream,</i>

01:27.807 --> 01:32.144
<i>a single leaf falling after a
bird has rested on its branches,</i>

01:34.480 --> 01:40.420
<i>are the fact that ultimately, nature
is what it is, unapologetically.</i>

01:43.855 --> 01:46.959
<i>That silence is beautiful.</i>

02:05.111 --> 02:11.115
<i>There are two sounds in particular, that
will haunt me for the rest of my life.</i>

02:11.117 --> 02:15.419
<i>The first, being on the day where
the world changed forever.</i>

02:19.190 --> 02:20.826
<i>And then, there
was the second.</i>

03:06.838 --> 03:10.242
<i>Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, good. Push!</i>

03:12.911 --> 03:13.912
Adam.

03:15.981 --> 03:17.514
Push.

03:17.516 --> 03:19.883
I can't.

03:19.885 --> 03:22.388
Yes, you can. You're a strong woman.
You've got this.

03:24.023 --> 03:25.525
Evelyn, Evelyn...

03:27.225 --> 03:29.259
Do you know what you're having?

03:29.261 --> 03:33.362
We didn't find out, we...
We always thought it would be a boy.

03:33.364 --> 03:35.998
We always wanted a boy first.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.835
Okay, Evelyn.

03:37.837 --> 03:39.503
- Good. Push.
- Baby's right there. He's right there.

03:39.505 --> 03:40.840
There's the head.

03:44.576 --> 03:46.210
It's a boy.

03:46.212 --> 03:50.080
And he's here, it's a boy.
You have a boy just like you wanted.

03:53.319 --> 03:56.620
- What's wrong?
- Go, get the doctor right now.

03:56.622 --> 03:59.024
No, can I hold my son?

04:00.860 --> 04:04.230
Adam should be here!

04:05.130 --> 04:08.431
I want my son!

04:16.274 --> 04:20.313
- <i>Who's Adam?</i>
- <i>Adam is her husband.</i>

04:21.480 --> 04:23.316
<i>He died about
six months ago.</i>

05:12.263 --> 05:13.497
<i>Still not sleeping?</i>

05:13.499 --> 05:15.598
<i>No.</i>

05:15.600 --> 05:18.701
Have you been taking
your medications?

05:18.703 --> 05:21.941
When your last batch was delivered
the nurse noticed unopened bottles.

05:23.408 --> 05:25.010
Isn't that on my file, too?

05:28.713 --> 05:31.384
How is your religious
consultation progressing?

05:33.117 --> 05:36.052
I've decided it's not
really for me.

05:36.054 --> 05:38.223
It's a mandatory part
of your course.

05:39.191 --> 05:41.895
As I said, it's not for me.

05:45.364 --> 05:46.933
Are you still visiting him?

05:48.199 --> 05:50.334
You know I am.

05:50.336 --> 05:53.971
Let me explain something
to you, just listen, carefully.

05:53.973 --> 05:56.074
No matter how much medicine
you're prescribed,

05:57.109 --> 05:58.675
no matter
how many sessions we have

05:58.677 --> 06:04.113
where you choose to sit in complete silence,
nothing is going to help you move on

06:04.115 --> 06:06.184
with your life until you
sever this connection.

06:09.521 --> 06:12.521
Now let me explain
something to you.

06:12.523 --> 06:15.358
Apart from the fact that it is
unethical for you to tell me

06:15.360 --> 06:16.927
what I should
and shouldn't be doing,

06:16.929 --> 06:21.934
at the end of the day, I will never
leave him, so stop wasting your breath.

06:25.737 --> 06:27.040
Time's up.

06:51.562 --> 06:53.028
<i>And, they attacked...</i>

06:53.030 --> 06:56.432
<i>You can see pandemonium here.
We are seeing a national guard</i>

06:56.434 --> 06:58.502
<i>and, you can see
that they are...</i>

06:58.504 --> 07:01.374
<i>Main resistance
camp has stopped...</i>

08:58.891 --> 09:00.226
I brought
you something.

09:10.602 --> 09:12.269
I know you didn't
have this one

09:12.271 --> 09:14.506
and I thought you could
add it to your collection.

09:20.279 --> 09:21.713
Do you want me
to sing you the song?

09:23.482 --> 09:24.516
Okay.

09:29.788 --> 09:36.462
<i>♪ Round and round the garden
Like a teddy bear</i>

09:37.896 --> 09:43.301
<i>♪ One step, two step</i>

09:46.338 --> 09:48.875
<i>♪ Tickle you under there! ♪</i>

09:53.212 --> 09:56.613
<i>Mrs. Green we have been
monitoring the boy's condition</i>

09:56.615 --> 09:58.782
for going on, six years.

09:58.784 --> 09:59.849
Thomas?

09:59.851 --> 10:01.518
I'm sorry?

10:01.520 --> 10:03.456
My sons name is Thomas.

10:04.723 --> 10:05.824
Of course.

10:07.025 --> 10:13.863
Thomas' condition, hasn't
changed in quite some time.

10:13.865 --> 10:17.967
We've run hundreds of tests, consulted
some of the best doctors and scientists

10:17.969 --> 10:20.205
in the world, regarding
motor neuron study.

10:21.872 --> 10:26.545
We just don't think there
will ever be... a change.

10:28.679 --> 10:32.484
You need to start focusing
on your future, Evelyn.

10:33.517 --> 10:35.018
So, what are you saying?

10:35.020 --> 10:37.387
Like I've said before,
if there's nothing you can do,

10:37.389 --> 10:38.520
then just let me
take him home.

10:38.522 --> 10:40.192
You know that's
not an option.

10:45.329 --> 10:47.697
What are you
suggesting, then?

10:47.699 --> 10:52.371
Mrs. Green, we are running
out of options.

10:54.272 --> 10:56.208
Have you considered
euthanasia?

10:59.511 --> 11:00.744
Evelyn?

11:00.746 --> 11:01.847
Don't.

11:05.983 --> 11:07.619
This isn't
a life for him.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.422
You should put him out
of his misery.

11:12.424 --> 11:16.625
He's a lab experiment locked in a
cage, Mrs. Green, he deserves better.

11:16.627 --> 11:18.363
You deserve better.

11:19.865 --> 11:20.996
Evelyn, are you all right?

11:20.998 --> 11:23.667
No, leave me alone.

11:23.669 --> 11:24.734
Pardon?

11:24.736 --> 11:27.306
You heard what I said,
leave.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.710
We will give you 10 minutes
to gather your thoughts.

11:33.712 --> 11:37.750
Any longer than that, and I will
have security escort you out.

11:45.457 --> 11:48.828
We will have to finish this
conversation at some point, Evelyn.

12:47.852 --> 12:48.920
<i>You still have it?</i>

12:52.056 --> 12:54.659
It's one of the only
things I have left of you.

13:02.934 --> 13:04.670
I can't do it anymore.

13:06.838 --> 13:08.705
I have tried

13:08.707 --> 13:11.644
so hard for so long.

13:17.716 --> 13:19.952
I feel like
I have no purpose.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.422
<i>He is your purpose.</i>

13:26.724 --> 13:27.726
You heard them.

13:30.561 --> 13:31.796
They want to kill him.

13:34.165 --> 13:40.772
They're going to murder
our son, our baby.

13:56.588 --> 13:57.823
What's it like?

14:02.026 --> 14:03.896
Not having to feel anymore.

14:05.796 --> 14:07.132
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

14:13.237 --> 14:15.840
<i>Evelyn!</i>

14:30.921 --> 14:32.154
Evelyn.

14:32.156 --> 14:33.889
Can I help you?

14:33.891 --> 14:37.192
Look, I know you don't know
me but you can help me.

14:37.194 --> 14:38.394
Evelyn, my name
is Ethan Varick.

14:38.396 --> 14:40.730
I have something very important
to talk to you about.

14:40.732 --> 14:44.067
- Go away.
- Wait, Evelyn, please.

14:44.069 --> 14:46.668
I don't know you, please go
away before I call the police.

14:46.670 --> 14:47.939
It's about your son.

14:50.074 --> 14:51.743
What do you know
about my son?

14:52.544 --> 14:53.777
May-may I please come in?

14:53.779 --> 14:56.111
No, you can't come in. Tell me
what you know about my son.

14:56.113 --> 14:59.182
I'm really sorry to make contact with you
like this but I had to wait until now,

14:59.184 --> 15:00.917
it's far too dangerous
during the day.

15:00.919 --> 15:02.719
You're not making any sense.

15:02.721 --> 15:05.522
They're covering it up. They're
hiding the truth from us.

15:05.524 --> 15:07.023
Who is? From what?

15:07.025 --> 15:09.625
Them, the government.

15:09.627 --> 15:13.096
I had a daughter, she has the same problem.
She had the same problem.

15:13.098 --> 15:14.596
What are you
talking about?

15:14.598 --> 15:16.966
Tomorrow...

15:16.968 --> 15:19.201
Tomorrow, you will be visited by
the FBI, they're looking for me,

15:19.203 --> 15:21.837
don't tell them anything.
You never saw me.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.139
- I thought this was about my son.
- It is.

15:24.141 --> 15:26.609
Meet me tomorrow
at the Stone Arch Bridge, 9:00.

15:26.611 --> 15:27.744
Make sure they
don't follow you.

15:27.746 --> 15:28.848
What?

16:53.330 --> 16:54.599
Miss Green.

16:55.666 --> 16:56.966
Mrs.

16:56.968 --> 16:58.737
Oh, pardon me, ma'am.

16:59.703 --> 17:01.104
I'm special agent David Roth

17:01.106 --> 17:03.205
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

17:03.207 --> 17:05.874
and this is Agent Greisen.

17:05.876 --> 17:07.713
Is there something
I can help you with?

17:08.847 --> 17:10.214
I sure do hope so, ma'am.

17:14.019 --> 17:15.220
May we come in?

17:27.964 --> 17:29.899
I apologize about the mess,

17:29.901 --> 17:32.671
I've been rather busy lately
and haven't been home much.

17:33.370 --> 17:36.138
No, not a concern at all.

17:36.140 --> 17:39.210
We, of course, apologize for
interrupting your day, Mrs. Green.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.916
We were wondering if you
have ever seen this man?

17:47.452 --> 17:50.923
No, I'm sorry I've
never seen that man before.

17:52.257 --> 17:54.891
That's unfortunate.

17:54.893 --> 17:57.930
We have a witness who placed this
man in this building, last night.

17:59.798 --> 18:03.098
I'm sorry, I wish I could be
more help, Mr. Roth.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.268
Please call me David.

18:05.403 --> 18:07.772
He's a very dangerous
man, Mrs. Green.

18:09.707 --> 18:11.743
I have a warrant
for his immediate arrest.

18:15.113 --> 18:19.785
You know, I'm always fascinated by
how much neighbors like to talk.

18:21.485 --> 18:25.721
Gossip caught at its origin
is a very useful tool

18:25.723 --> 18:28.226
when hunting people
who belong behind bars.

18:32.163 --> 18:36.669
What will little Thomas do if he
doesn't have you, Mrs. Green?

18:40.003 --> 18:41.040
Call me, Evelyn.

18:42.941 --> 18:46.509
Okay, Evelyn.

18:46.511 --> 18:49.013
You don't mind if we have
a little look around?

18:52.951 --> 18:56.519
If you'll excuse me for a minute, I'm...
just a little distressed.

18:56.521 --> 19:01.159
Of course, please take your time.
We aren't going anywhere.

20:07.559 --> 20:10.526
"Behold, the day is coming

20:10.528 --> 20:15.198
"when I will raise up
for David a righteous Branch

20:15.200 --> 20:18.201
"and he will reign as king."

20:18.203 --> 20:20.068
You tell me exactly
who you are

20:20.070 --> 20:23.242
and why the hell I have two FBI
agents searching my apartment?

20:24.075 --> 20:25.874
Were you followed?

20:25.876 --> 20:29.846
I am only here because you told me
you knew something about my son.

20:29.848 --> 20:33.583
No, I am not getting dragged into
whatever trouble you are in.

20:33.585 --> 20:36.853
I know about
your son's condition,

20:36.855 --> 20:40.425
it isn't an isolated case like
they have kept you believing.

20:42.126 --> 20:43.295
How would you know that?

20:45.062 --> 20:47.198
My daughter was born
the same way.

20:50.934 --> 20:53.970
They convinced us
it was a rare disease,

20:53.972 --> 20:57.475
something that prevented her brain from
communicating with the rest of her body.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.876
I did some digging,

21:00.878 --> 21:05.047
there are more cases like this
around the world than you think.

21:05.049 --> 21:08.319
Hundreds, possibly
thousands by now.

21:13.491 --> 21:16.595
Have they suggested
euthanasia yet?

21:30.340 --> 21:33.846
I am innocent, I was set up.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.949
And, those men do not
work for the FBI.

21:40.684 --> 21:43.454
Get in the car and I'll
tell you everything.

22:11.648 --> 22:14.285
Our doctors suggested
euthanasia too.

22:16.119 --> 22:18.522
They're trying to cover
all of this up.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.292
They wanna
keep us quiet.

22:22.626 --> 22:25.129
They murdered my wife.

22:27.464 --> 22:29.999
After serving my
country for years,

22:30.001 --> 22:32.535
they dishonorably discharged
me from the military

22:32.537 --> 22:35.403
and now I'm wanted
for treason.

22:35.405 --> 22:39.176
When I did nothing more
than try to protect my family.

22:45.482 --> 22:48.419
I can't do this without you.

22:49.386 --> 22:50.720
I wanna see, Thomas.

22:50.722 --> 22:53.055
You can't,

22:53.057 --> 22:55.423
it's too dangerous, that's the
first place they will look.

22:55.425 --> 22:58.259
No, no, I need to see him,

22:58.261 --> 23:02.033
if all of this is true then I
need to say goodbye at least.

23:09.540 --> 23:10.575
This is Lily.

23:13.543 --> 23:15.046
She was five.

23:18.782 --> 23:20.084
Right now,

23:21.118 --> 23:22.687
your son exists.

23:25.088 --> 23:26.524
According to the rest
of the world,

23:27.791 --> 23:30.261
my daughter never did.

23:34.765 --> 23:36.165
<i>Here are the breaking news,</i>

23:36.167 --> 23:38.666
<i>local police are on the lookout
for a young woman who they</i>

23:38.668 --> 23:42.304
<i>believe is aiding a man that is
wanted by the FBI for questioning.</i>

23:42.306 --> 23:46.442
<i>She is believed to have last been seen
fleeing her downtown apartment this morning.</i>

23:46.444 --> 23:49.047
<i>Anyone with any information,
please contact...</i>

23:50.415 --> 23:51.550
We're out of time.

23:55.586 --> 23:59.758
I promise you, I will
help you get your son back.

24:12.636 --> 24:15.107
I may know someone
who could help us.

24:29.386 --> 24:30.554
Evelyn.

24:31.621 --> 24:32.855
Hey.

24:32.857 --> 24:34.059
Hi, Aidan.

24:39.363 --> 24:40.632
Come on in.
Come on in.

24:53.444 --> 24:54.678
Jeez, what a mess!

24:57.348 --> 24:59.050
So, how have you been?

25:00.751 --> 25:02.220
I've been getting by.

25:04.288 --> 25:09.258
You know, I tried to come visit you in
the hospital after Thomas was born.

25:09.260 --> 25:10.692
I actually
came a few times

25:10.694 --> 25:14.329
but the doctors said... doctor's
said you didn't wanna see anybody,

25:14.331 --> 25:17.401
let alone me, I love dad,
I'm like a son.

25:19.270 --> 25:21.537
I needed to let
you know that...

25:21.539 --> 25:23.842
You don't have
to explain. I know.

25:27.411 --> 25:32.314
Jesus, where are my manners?
Would you like some coffee?

25:32.316 --> 25:34.119
- Something to drink?
- No, thank you.

25:34.652 --> 25:36.585
Sure.

25:36.587 --> 25:38.557
Let me get you some
coffee, coming right up.

25:41.192 --> 25:45.664
You know, I've been seeing
your face all over the TV, son.

25:46.630 --> 25:47.864
I mean...

25:47.866 --> 25:51.200
Your hair is different,
definitely got different hair.

25:51.202 --> 25:54.739
But it's nothing a trained eye can't
spot and I never forget a face.

25:56.307 --> 25:57.742
They murdered my wife, sir.

26:00.478 --> 26:02.711
I know how it sounds but
they're covering it all up.

26:02.713 --> 26:04.348
- "They"?
- Yes, they.

26:05.348 --> 26:06.682
Our government.

26:08.319 --> 26:11.252
I know it sounds
crazy, sir, but...

26:11.254 --> 26:14.592
Nothing too crazy when it comes to the U.S.
government, son.

26:16.793 --> 26:22.964
They put as much effort into
education, medical sectors,

26:22.966 --> 26:27.903
helping out vets as they do into
conspiracies, we'd have the most functional,

26:27.905 --> 26:32.473
progressive government
on the whole goddamn planet.

26:32.475 --> 26:36.744
They have always said that
Thomas was an isolated case,

26:36.746 --> 26:39.783
but Ethan had a daughter that was
born with the same condition.

26:44.588 --> 26:45.756
Listen to me, carefully,

26:49.226 --> 26:52.263
if you get caught
and my name is dropped,

26:53.463 --> 26:54.863
I'll have to turn my back.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.932
- I won't be able to help you.
- No, of course.

26:56.934 --> 26:58.302
We understand.

27:00.303 --> 27:04.842
Now I can't... I can't confirm
any of this, of course,

27:06.978 --> 27:09.478
but I've heard whispers,

27:09.480 --> 27:13.781
of a government program up north,
something to do with children.

27:13.783 --> 27:18.389
I don't know the details,
they are all... vague,

27:20.290 --> 27:21.557
but could be nothing.

27:21.559 --> 27:22.959
Or, it could be something.

27:22.961 --> 27:27.730
I wouldn't count on it, son,
and I don't need to remind you

27:27.732 --> 27:32.034
that you're stepping into some very dangerous
territory here, I would reconsider.

27:32.036 --> 27:35.336
I'm already in dangerous
territory.

27:35.338 --> 27:37.439
I'm not going down
for something I didn't do.

27:37.441 --> 27:40.779
Yeah, well, you just don't
take her down with you.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.621
What's this?

27:52.623 --> 27:54.923
It's the name and number
of an old friend up north,

27:54.925 --> 27:56.828
he's gonna tell you
what you need to know.

28:00.498 --> 28:02.367
Thank you, Aidan.

28:03.334 --> 28:04.900
Hmm-mm.

28:04.902 --> 28:07.239
Well, I guess, this is where
I say, "Good luck."

28:09.540 --> 28:10.841
This will do.

28:18.382 --> 28:19.484
Are you sure
you can trust him?

28:20.617 --> 28:23.254
He won't turn us in
if that's what you're asking.

28:33.664 --> 28:36.865
Our biggest problem is gonna
be getting across this border.

28:36.867 --> 28:40.669
Ever since marburg hit, every
border has become heavily fortified

28:40.671 --> 28:42.607
with tight security
around the clock.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.011
We need to figure out
how we're gonna get across.

28:49.813 --> 28:50.848
I have an idea.

28:54.452 --> 28:55.587
But you're not
gonna like it.

29:25.915 --> 29:26.850
What is this place?

29:28.586 --> 29:31.819
I suppose you would
call it a hangout spot,

29:31.821 --> 29:35.426
but more for criminals
who like to keep a low key.

29:36.793 --> 29:41.832
Drug dealers,
dirty cops, lawyers.

29:44.667 --> 29:50.172
A friend of a friend runs this joint.
Just stay close to me.

30:37.754 --> 30:38.886
Wait here.

30:38.888 --> 30:40.823
Where you going?

30:40.825 --> 30:41.923
Will be back
in just a minute.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.027
Ethan.

30:59.676 --> 31:01.713
Anyone can count the seeds
in an apple.

31:09.552 --> 31:13.624
Only God, can count the
number of apples in a seed.

31:21.232 --> 31:24.766
Wouldn't pick you as a supporter
of Christian televangelists.

31:33.978 --> 31:36.514
Never judge a book
by its cover, my friend.

31:38.915 --> 31:40.684
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we?

32:24.895 --> 32:26.530
Evening, Mrs. Green.

32:29.934 --> 32:32.803
I wouldn't have expected to
see you in a place like this.

32:35.705 --> 32:40.611
Special agent David Roth. We met earlier
this morning at your apartment.

32:43.914 --> 32:45.517
Please, have a seat.

32:55.358 --> 32:57.291
You know,
I was a bit concerned

32:57.293 --> 32:59.930
the way you rushed off this
morning, without saying goodbye.

33:01.932 --> 33:03.201
Are you here alone?

33:04.367 --> 33:07.271
Yes. Just me,
having a drink.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.308
I had a bit
of a rough morning.

33:13.610 --> 33:17.114
Well, it's a peculiar place for a
woman to have a drink by herself.

33:20.951 --> 33:23.588
Since we're here,
let me buy you another.

33:25.789 --> 33:26.857
Sure.

33:27.691 --> 33:28.726
Whiskey?

33:29.626 --> 33:30.662
Yeah.

33:31.328 --> 33:33.697
Two whiskeys, neat please.

33:38.202 --> 33:43.308
We're still searching for that man, we
talked about this morning, Ethan Varick.

33:45.309 --> 33:47.211
You haven't seen him
since then, have you?

33:48.044 --> 33:50.614
No. No, I haven't. Sorry.

33:56.854 --> 34:01.693
Let's play a little game, shall we?
A drinking game, if you will.

34:03.027 --> 34:06.794
Pick a number between...
Say one and 20.

34:06.796 --> 34:09.996
I'm not very good
at those sort of things.

34:09.998 --> 34:14.972
It's pretty simple, just pick
a number, anyone can do it.

34:18.206 --> 34:20.174
One.

34:20.176 --> 34:24.915
Oh, so close. But no.
Drink up.

34:30.420 --> 34:31.822
Let's try again.

34:34.357 --> 34:35.225
Twenty?

34:36.926 --> 34:41.831
Very good, you got it.
Let's drink anyway.

34:50.039 --> 34:52.873
An interesting fact,

34:52.876 --> 34:56.377
did you know that 20 is the minimum
number of years you can go to prison

34:56.379 --> 34:58.782
for harboring
and assisting fugitive.

35:04.821 --> 35:06.223
Is this man
bothering you?

35:08.859 --> 35:10.895
No, it's okay.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.495
Everything is fine.

35:14.497 --> 35:17.001
Special agent David Roth, FBI.

35:19.035 --> 35:20.804
Do you think
I care about FBI?

35:22.740 --> 35:26.741
If you're bothering one
of our customers, you get out.

35:26.743 --> 35:28.509
Women get enough shit
from men in this world,

35:28.511 --> 35:31.779
without needing to be
interrupted when having drinks.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.952
Fair enough, but I am
a paying customer.

35:36.754 --> 35:41.022
I don't care,
I don't like you.

35:41.024 --> 35:45.926
You see, my brother and I, we decide who
drinks and doesn't drink at this bar.

35:45.928 --> 35:50.267
So, don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

35:52.002 --> 35:53.137
<i>Dasvidaniya.</i>

35:57.307 --> 35:58.372
This way.

35:58.374 --> 35:59.376
Let him go.

36:02.245 --> 36:04.812
Get the car,
get the car, move.

36:09.787 --> 36:12.356
Evelyn, get in! Quick.

36:25.169 --> 36:30.104
Who are you and why is the fucking
FBI snooping around my bar?

36:30.106 --> 36:31.272
It's a long story.

36:31.274 --> 36:34.176
You better start
talking quick

36:34.178 --> 36:37.578
before I squeeze this trigger
a little too hard, my friend.

36:37.580 --> 36:40.549
All you need to know is, those
men are not from the FBI.

36:40.551 --> 36:43.884
And, it's in your best
interest to help us.

36:49.892 --> 36:50.959
Are you chipped?

36:50.961 --> 36:52.196
I'm not.

36:55.131 --> 36:57.566
- Give me your arm. Give me your arm.
- What?

36:57.568 --> 37:00.602
They found us because they're tracking
a chip. We need to take it out.

37:00.604 --> 37:02.069
- No.
- Evelyn, please.

37:02.071 --> 37:05.973
If you don't, I slit your throat
and throw you out the back door.

37:05.975 --> 37:07.408
No, no.

37:07.410 --> 37:09.079
Hold her still.

37:21.925 --> 37:23.093
Lose them.

37:55.392 --> 37:56.527
Get out.

38:15.077 --> 38:20.317
So, I take you across
border for $50,000.

38:24.053 --> 38:26.120
$50,000?

38:26.122 --> 38:30.026
You failed to mention you're a wanted
man and the FBI is all over your ass.

38:31.160 --> 38:35.430
So, that's the price.

38:35.432 --> 38:38.169
Take it or leave it,
my friend.

38:39.970 --> 38:42.006
The rest when you get
us across the border.

38:47.310 --> 38:51.279
Deal. Get in van.
We leave now.

38:51.281 --> 38:53.480
No. No, I'm not getting
back in that van.

38:53.482 --> 38:57.685
We're getting closer by the minute. You
don't have to trust them, but at least

38:57.687 --> 39:01.124
try and trust me. Remember
why you're doing this.

39:03.093 --> 39:04.161
Think of Thomas.

40:29.111 --> 40:31.247
License and medical papers,
please.

40:40.057 --> 40:43.127
Please present your microchips
for routine identification scan.

40:48.330 --> 40:51.533
Why are you crossing
the border today, sir?

40:51.535 --> 40:55.069
Local farmer, selling our
produce at market tomorrow.

40:55.071 --> 40:56.571
You have clearance papers
for the produce?

40:56.573 --> 40:57.775
Of course, we do.

41:01.845 --> 41:04.482
We're gonna have to take a look
at the back of this van, sir.

41:09.385 --> 41:10.588
Sir?

41:48.758 --> 41:51.758
Best fruit
in the metropolitan area,

41:51.760 --> 41:53.463
good quality.
Very expensive.

41:54.897 --> 41:56.600
I let you have
one for free.

41:59.401 --> 42:00.604
Suit yourself.

42:07.510 --> 42:08.678
Thank you for your time, sir.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.147
You may proceed.

42:12.149 --> 42:13.284
Let them through!

42:13.682 --> 42:15.218
<i>Dasvidaniya.</i>

43:07.537 --> 43:09.504
That was close.

43:09.506 --> 43:13.777
Tough times never last, my friend.
Tough people, however, do.

43:20.584 --> 43:24.451
It's literally just across the border, you
can at least take us to the next town.

43:24.453 --> 43:30.461
That was not part of the deal, my friend. Next
time, you best being a bit more specific.

43:37.234 --> 43:39.502
Motherfucker!
I want my money.

43:49.011 --> 43:50.747
Come on. Come on.

44:21.278 --> 44:22.946
What the hell was that,
back there?

44:27.316 --> 44:28.952
Jesus, I need a cigarette.

44:30.586 --> 44:33.790
Are you all right?
Let me see.

44:39.629 --> 44:42.366
It isn't too bad.
It'll be okay.

44:44.667 --> 44:45.736
Does it hurt?

44:48.004 --> 44:49.373
It's not that.

44:53.343 --> 44:57.848
I don't know what happened.
I just blacked out.

45:01.517 --> 45:03.319
What am I doing, Ethan?

45:05.789 --> 45:08.591
Thomas is alone.

45:12.428 --> 45:14.831
He is probably wondering
where I am.

45:17.934 --> 45:19.970
I'm sorry I dragged you
into all this.

45:21.738 --> 45:22.906
I care, Evelyn.

45:24.740 --> 45:26.609
I promise you, I do.

45:33.082 --> 45:34.751
I know this is important.

45:37.921 --> 45:41.524
I've just been so used
to my routine.

45:43.059 --> 45:44.528
My life.

45:49.531 --> 45:55.372
On the positive side of things,
you just saved me $25,000.

45:58.675 --> 46:02.680
Okay, you rest here
for the remainder of the day.

46:03.713 --> 46:04.848
I'll make sure we're safe.

46:06.015 --> 46:07.584
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

46:29.539 --> 46:32.743
So, what's next?

46:35.845 --> 46:38.513
From what I can tell,
we stopped a few hours

46:38.515 --> 46:40.884
after the border-crossing,
around about here.

46:42.584 --> 46:45.520
So, if we're to avoid
the interstate,

46:45.522 --> 46:49.524
we should try to catch a ride on the
interior road which eventually cuts back

46:49.526 --> 46:51.528
and over this bridge
and into town.

46:57.434 --> 46:59.801
What the hell are you
doing on my property?

46:59.803 --> 47:02.602
I'm sorry for trespassing, sir.
We were just looking for shelter.

47:02.604 --> 47:05.573
Take a step back, boy, or I'll blow
a hole right through your head.

47:05.575 --> 47:08.442
I'm well within my rights
to kill you where you stand.

47:08.444 --> 47:10.111
Sir, if you will just
let me explain.

47:10.113 --> 47:12.850
You got five seconds
to get off my property.

47:13.482 --> 47:15.616
Five, Four...

47:15.618 --> 47:16.620
We're going.

47:17.019 --> 47:19.187
Three, two...

47:19.189 --> 47:24.625
Stephen Joseph Erickson, what
did I tell you about that gun?

47:24.627 --> 47:27.462
I was just escorting these
trespassers off our property.

47:27.464 --> 47:28.763
You best stay
out of this, woman.

47:28.765 --> 47:32.933
Every week, it is something
with the damn guns.

47:32.935 --> 47:37.104
They are just lucky, I didn't stick the
dogs on them. Haven't fed them yet, today.

47:37.106 --> 47:43.243
I know you're not speaking about Koby
and Jeremiah because they would just

47:43.245 --> 47:49.086
as soon be man-eating guard dogs as I
am president of these United States.

47:51.687 --> 47:52.888
You folks, all right?

47:54.823 --> 48:00.127
We're sorry, our car broke down
a few miles back and then,

48:00.129 --> 48:03.434
we're exhausted, w-we just
needed a place to stay.

48:04.968 --> 48:08.069
- Well, come on in.
- What?

48:08.071 --> 48:13.841
You just need a good meal and
a nice warm bed to sleep in.

48:13.843 --> 48:18.781
Stephen, you come too and feed
the guard dogs on your way in.

48:42.171 --> 48:43.870
Don't mind me, dears.

48:43.872 --> 48:47.542
I've got you some nice, big
spare blankets here,

48:47.544 --> 48:52.212
just in case, it gets cold during the night
and there are some extra bandages here

48:52.214 --> 48:53.980
for your arm.

48:53.982 --> 48:57.118
Thank you so much for
your hospitality, Margaret.

48:57.120 --> 49:01.124
Oh, there is nothing better than
doing good deeds, I always say.

49:02.325 --> 49:04.794
I do hope that you sleep
well tonight.

49:06.796 --> 49:08.665
This used to be my son's room.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.069
Before he went off

49:13.769 --> 49:16.639
and went to that
damn war, leaving us

49:18.040 --> 49:19.709
make ends meet.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.182
I'll see you in the morning.

49:26.716 --> 49:27.751
Good night.

49:49.939 --> 49:52.276
The world is so focused
on violence,

49:53.743 --> 49:54.945
no wonder
it's falling apart.

49:59.848 --> 50:03.220
"In war, truth
is the first casualty."

50:06.923 --> 50:08.058
Winston Churchill.

50:10.993 --> 50:12.261
My husband
used to say that.

50:15.932 --> 50:19.770
He didn't like war but he wanted
to fight for this country

50:21.004 --> 50:23.272
and he was prone to defend
the people he loved.

50:26.309 --> 50:29.680
It was a bitter-sweet
difference in our marriage,

50:31.280 --> 50:32.749
I despise war.

50:36.818 --> 50:38.254
You remind me of him,

50:41.089 --> 50:42.693
more than I realized.

50:45.928 --> 50:48.632
Lets re-wrap your wrist
before you go to bed.

51:15.892 --> 51:19.696
My wife was the fan
of Churchill, not me.

51:21.863 --> 51:24.734
She used to quote him to me,
each time I was recalled.

51:34.377 --> 51:37.381
I think she hoped it might make
me change my mind and stay.

51:41.984 --> 51:43.787
Now, I wish I had
listened to her.

51:50.727 --> 51:54.364
When Adam died,
I was three months pregnant.

51:56.466 --> 51:59.336
He left me alone to fight
a meaningless war.

52:08.410 --> 52:11.814
Your wife was right to hope.

52:15.852 --> 52:18.155
Sometimes that's all
we have left.

54:43.665 --> 54:44.868
Evelyn.

54:46.068 --> 54:47.403
Evelyn, we have to go.

54:47.669 --> 54:48.736
What?

54:48.738 --> 54:51.508
- Get dressed. They're here. They found us.
- What?

54:55.343 --> 54:59.446
Thank you for coming.
They're upstairs, asleep.

54:59.448 --> 55:01.948
When do I get my reward?

55:01.950 --> 55:04.084
Soon enough,
Mrs. Erickson.

55:04.086 --> 55:05.488
Your government thanks you.

55:45.026 --> 55:46.128
Roth!

56:03.446 --> 56:04.481
They're coming.

56:17.126 --> 56:18.461
We aren't going
fast enough.

56:21.162 --> 56:22.598
They're going
to catch up with us.

56:47.256 --> 56:48.258
Come on.

57:07.042 --> 57:08.178
Don't lose them.

57:27.363 --> 57:29.631
Stop making this harder
for yourself, Varick.

59:34.289 --> 59:35.858
There, that's it.

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:45.727
You see that phone booth, you go
make the call, I'll keep watch.

01:01:06.481 --> 01:01:07.580
<i>Hello.</i>

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:09.915
Hello.

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:14.323
Yes, my name is Evelyn Green,
I'm a friend of Aidan Woodrow.

01:01:18.026 --> 01:01:20.629
Right, yes.

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:23.832
We're here...
we're here now.

01:01:30.039 --> 01:01:33.408
Okay, sure.

01:01:42.818 --> 01:01:43.883
What did he say?

01:01:43.885 --> 01:01:45.651
He said, he's in town
right now.

01:01:45.653 --> 01:01:47.856
He'll meet us in half an hour
and he gave me the place.

01:01:49.792 --> 01:01:51.627
Let's not keep him waiting.

01:02:49.752 --> 01:02:52.088
Hello, I'm Evelyn.

01:02:54.089 --> 01:02:55.725
I'm here with Ethan Varick.

01:03:16.144 --> 01:03:17.446
Thank you for meeting us.

01:03:18.013 --> 01:03:19.582
You like this song?

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.564
I'm sorry to have contacted you
out of the blue like this.

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:37.432
Pretty necklace.

01:03:40.736 --> 01:03:42.638
You and your friend
in some kind of trouble?

01:03:44.673 --> 01:03:45.808
You could say that.

01:03:50.044 --> 01:03:52.581
Aidan said, you might be
able to help us.

01:03:59.555 --> 01:04:01.723
My son, he's sick.

01:04:04.059 --> 01:04:05.761
They say, they don't
know what it is.

01:04:08.897 --> 01:04:13.566
You might wanna be paying
attention to the radio.

01:04:13.568 --> 01:04:18.073
Big announcement coming soon, supposedly,
it's gonna change the world.

01:04:19.874 --> 01:04:23.042
- On the phone...
- I can already hear the whispers.

01:04:23.044 --> 01:04:25.615
It's coming, sooner
than we all think.

01:04:27.482 --> 01:04:30.616
You'll understand what it
really means, though.

01:04:30.618 --> 01:04:33.620
You're not a pill swallower
like most of the world.

01:04:33.622 --> 01:04:34.924
I can tell from your eyes.

01:04:37.993 --> 01:04:42.895
The men that are after you, they
aren't who they say they are.

01:04:42.897 --> 01:04:44.966
It's much bigger
than you think.

01:04:47.169 --> 01:04:48.134
I'm sorry, I...

01:04:48.136 --> 01:04:51.872
The awakening isn't
happening quick enough.

01:04:51.874 --> 01:04:55.778
There's too many obstacles and not
enough time. They aren't going to win.

01:04:56.879 --> 01:04:57.947
You need to know...

01:05:10.158 --> 01:05:14.163
What the hell are you doing?
That wasn't part of the plan.

01:05:15.097 --> 01:05:16.131
Plans change.

01:05:17.765 --> 01:05:18.901
You better know
what you are doing.

01:05:20.202 --> 01:05:22.935
You had your chance, Ethan.

01:05:22.937 --> 01:05:25.037
They feel you're
deviating too far,

01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:27.909
that you may no longer have
it in you to do what it takes.

01:05:29.977 --> 01:05:31.646
I'm here to make sure you do.

01:06:27.035 --> 01:06:29.705
Good morning, careful.

01:06:30.972 --> 01:06:32.939
What happened?

01:06:32.941 --> 01:06:35.040
You've been
unconscious for days.

01:06:35.042 --> 01:06:37.245
You've been burning up, I've just
been trying to keep you cool.

01:06:41.716 --> 01:06:42.783
Where am I?

01:06:42.785 --> 01:06:45.721
It's okay, you're in a camp.
My name is Alice.

01:06:47.888 --> 01:06:52.725
Ethan. There was a man
with me, where is he?

01:06:52.727 --> 01:06:54.961
I don't know,
I wasn't there.

01:06:54.963 --> 01:06:57.700
There was a fight and we rescued
you and we brought you here.

01:07:00.801 --> 01:07:01.903
What's your name?

01:07:03.171 --> 01:07:04.173
Evelyn.

01:07:05.374 --> 01:07:06.709
It's a nice name.

01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:24.826
Welcome back to the land of the conscious.
How are you feeling?

01:07:26.093 --> 01:07:28.763
You are safe now, that's
what you need to know.

01:07:31.732 --> 01:07:33.299
Where's
everyone going?

01:07:33.301 --> 01:07:35.769
We're getting ready
to leave and head home.

01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:39.872
All will be revealed in due
course, I promise. I'm Michael.

01:07:39.874 --> 01:07:44.144
Alice will take care of you and
help you with anything you need.

01:07:44.146 --> 01:07:45.444
We're a couple of minutes
from heading out.

01:07:45.446 --> 01:07:47.115
Arvid and the rest
will all continue on for us.

01:07:49.216 --> 01:07:50.852
Here, this will make
you feel better.

01:07:52.086 --> 01:07:53.722
It can get quite
cool on the way up.

01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:57.723
Where is your home?

01:07:57.725 --> 01:07:59.926
It's not far
from here just,

01:07:59.928 --> 01:08:01.931
half a day, across the other
side of the mountain.

01:08:26.886 --> 01:08:29.923
It's very unusual for them
to send for someone.

01:08:29.925 --> 01:08:31.758
You've caused quite a bit
of trouble but they told us

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.029
- that it would all be worth it.
- Alice.

01:08:33.794 --> 01:08:35.060
I don't understand.

01:08:35.062 --> 01:08:36.064
You will.

01:08:37.899 --> 01:08:40.500
Don't worry yourself. Where
we're going is really safe.

01:08:40.502 --> 01:08:42.135
Michael and I have
been there for a while now,

01:08:42.136 --> 01:08:45.371
ever since we had
to leave our last home.

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:46.470
Because there ain't
a place in the world

01:08:46.473 --> 01:08:48.377
that I would ever consider
raising a child now.

01:08:48.908 --> 01:08:49.975
Michael.

01:08:49.977 --> 01:08:51.145
I'll be right back.

01:08:53.314 --> 01:08:56.049
It's our first wedding
anniversary, next week.

01:08:56.051 --> 01:08:58.184
We're celebrating in the same
place we got married,

01:08:58.185 --> 01:08:59.721
which is not far
from we're going.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.189
It's gonna be so beautiful,
just like the wedding

01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:06.225
and fairy lights strung up
on the trees and everything,

01:09:06.227 --> 01:09:08.327
just like how I imagined
it as a little girl.

01:09:08.328 --> 01:09:10.196
- It's nice.
- Alice.

01:09:10.198 --> 01:09:13.032
I'm taking a small team and
breaking off from the main group.

01:09:13.033 --> 01:09:16.035
You continue heading home, but, I
will regroup with you, later on.

01:09:16.037 --> 01:09:17.170
Why? What's wrong?

01:09:17.171 --> 01:09:18.871
Just a precaution.

01:09:18.872 --> 01:09:20.773
Or I can come with you,
I can help you.

01:09:20.774 --> 01:09:23.479
Not this time. Not with groups
A and B off-site as well.

01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:26.448
Do as I say, please.

01:09:30.519 --> 01:09:31.885
I love you.

01:09:31.886 --> 01:09:32.988
I love you, too.

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:44.563
Look at what we have
here, Mr. Varick.

01:09:44.564 --> 01:09:46.434
Your little friend
is doing us proud.

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:54.843
You're not having any second
thoughts about this, are you, Ethan?

01:09:56.845 --> 01:09:57.879
I'm not.

01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.214
Good.

01:10:01.283 --> 01:10:03.385
Because I would hate for us
to have a problem again.

01:10:04.319 --> 01:10:05.451
They're breaking up.

01:10:05.453 --> 01:10:07.886
They know we're here.

01:10:07.888 --> 01:10:09.859
Keep an eye on the girl,
we still need her.

01:10:10.825 --> 01:10:12.225
The others
are on their way.

01:10:12.227 --> 01:10:16.062
Williams, go with Greisen and meet
them at the rendezvous point.

01:10:16.064 --> 01:10:18.200
Ethan and I are going
to say, hello.

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:27.108
Williams, make sure
the asset's in place.

01:10:28.075 --> 01:10:29.177
Hmm.

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:33.636
So, you're the one. He's been
waiting for you. Come with me.

01:13:24.686 --> 01:13:27.323
Hey, let me out.

01:13:28.623 --> 01:13:31.026
Hey! Hey!

01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:37.566
I've been
waiting an eternity,

01:13:39.266 --> 01:13:40.336
for this moment.

01:13:56.551 --> 01:14:01.123
There's no one out here, Michael.
We should just start heading back.

01:14:03.091 --> 01:14:04.226
What is it?

01:14:08.829 --> 01:14:11.199
Get down,
get on your knees.

01:14:13.068 --> 01:14:14.069
Do it, Ethan.

01:14:16.637 --> 01:14:18.073
I said, "Do it."

01:14:24.812 --> 01:14:26.181
Pick him up.

01:14:36.123 --> 01:14:38.657
Horrible habit, I know.

01:14:38.659 --> 01:14:43.228
Spend a few days with a couple of eccentric
minds and you walk away with an addiction

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:49.301
lasting several lifetimes,
give or take.

01:14:49.303 --> 01:14:53.141
Given all you've been through, you
look surprisingly well, Evelyn.

01:14:54.809 --> 01:14:56.578
How do you know my name?

01:15:00.815 --> 01:15:02.284
Do you know why
you are here?

01:15:04.218 --> 01:15:05.319
Who are you?

01:15:08.589 --> 01:15:11.456
I've been known by many
names through the ages.

01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:13.492
The Devil incarnate,

01:15:13.494 --> 01:15:15.428
the Beggar on the street,

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:18.499
but, people here simply
refer to me

01:15:19.534 --> 01:15:20.536
as The Shepherd.

01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:24.373
Regardless of who
I was or am,

01:15:25.672 --> 01:15:28.476
it's you, who are of
the utmost importance.

01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:32.147
What is going on here?

01:15:33.248 --> 01:15:35.184
What do you see
in your dreams, Evelyn?

01:15:37.351 --> 01:15:38.686
They're just dreams.

01:15:41.455 --> 01:15:44.223
"We are such stuff
as dreams are made on

01:15:44.225 --> 01:15:46.595
"and our little lives
are rounded with a sleep."

01:15:48.829 --> 01:15:54.435
But, you know this as well as I, you
see it every time you visit Thomas.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.815
Welcome back, Michael.

01:16:08.182 --> 01:16:09.650
It is Michael, right?

01:16:12.686 --> 01:16:15.723
No! You see, I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

01:16:17.859 --> 01:16:20.259
Where are my men?

01:16:20.261 --> 01:16:22.531
Oh, you mean the boys
he has playing soldier.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:26.835
They're dead.

01:16:28.636 --> 01:16:30.906
My friend and I here,
exterminated them.

01:16:33.408 --> 01:16:35.444
There's less of your
kind in the world now.

01:16:44.918 --> 01:16:46.622
You know what I've been
thinking, Michael?

01:16:50.357 --> 01:16:53.328
It's time for us
to play a little game.

01:17:00.334 --> 01:17:02.337
What do you know
about Thomas?

01:17:03.805 --> 01:17:06.538
Whether one chooses
to believe it or not, Evelyn,

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.974
there is more to life
than flesh and blood.

01:17:08.976 --> 01:17:12.310
Call it a soul
or a spirit within us

01:17:12.312 --> 01:17:15.480
that not only determines
who we are in this lifetime,

01:17:15.482 --> 01:17:16.517
but also the next.

01:17:17.519 --> 01:17:21.319
Reincarnation's not
a matter of fate, Evelyn.

01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:23.391
The ultimate
expression of free will.

01:17:25.994 --> 01:17:29.996
It's happening over the centuries,
more and more souls are choosing

01:17:29.998 --> 01:17:32.801
not to return.
Thomas is one.

01:17:33.834 --> 01:17:35.570
- So, he's not sick?
- No.

01:17:36.537 --> 01:17:38.703
But, he's not
as he should be.

01:17:38.705 --> 01:17:42.942
The boy you call your son
is just an empty shell.

01:17:42.944 --> 01:17:46.414
A vessel in which only
shadows of his soul reside.

01:17:47.848 --> 01:17:51.517
Why would he choose
not to be with me?

01:17:51.519 --> 01:17:56.621
Think of the events that have occurred
over the past few decades, in particular.

01:17:56.623 --> 01:18:00.593
Acts that have tripped new
waves of fear and terror.

01:18:00.595 --> 01:18:03.932
In order to ratchet up the levels
of chaos like never before.

01:18:04.966 --> 01:18:06.299
Make no mistake.

01:18:06.301 --> 01:18:11.569
Life is and always has been a
battle between order and chaos.

01:18:11.571 --> 01:18:15.073
And the reason chaos is thriving is
because they have effectively blocked

01:18:15.075 --> 01:18:21.080
the pathways to order, which is
through calm, rational thought.

01:18:21.082 --> 01:18:26.018
Some highly conscious spirits believe,
should they return they would be overrun

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:30.359
by the powers of chaos
and lose their souls, forever.

01:18:31.892 --> 01:18:34.893
Who's behind the chaos?

01:18:34.895 --> 01:18:37.996
Like me, they have been known
by many names through the ages,

01:18:37.998 --> 01:18:39.501
the Brotherhood of the snake,

01:18:40.001 --> 01:18:41.270
the Freemasons,

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.640
and in your time

01:18:45.839 --> 01:18:46.941
the Illuminati.

01:19:02.789 --> 01:19:04.359
Call it in.

01:19:05.059 --> 01:19:06.061
Roth.

01:19:07.794 --> 01:19:09.530
Roth, it's Williams,
come in.

01:19:11.732 --> 01:19:13.399
We've located the entrance.

01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:16.805
<i>Coming into position,
ready to move in on your order. Roth?</i>

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.043
Now
let's try this again.

01:19:27.448 --> 01:19:30.549
Is your Shepherd
hiding up there?

01:19:30.551 --> 01:19:34.754
Or are we just wiping out
one of your hideouts for fun?

01:19:34.756 --> 01:19:37.758
Why are you making this
so difficult on yourself?

01:19:39.427 --> 01:19:43.895
All you have to do is tell
us if he's up there.

01:19:43.897 --> 01:19:46.868
Then, we can all get on with
what we need to do today.

01:19:49.003 --> 01:19:50.969
<i>Roth, it's Williams. Come in.</i>

01:19:50.971 --> 01:19:52.039
No?

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.723
You're a fool if you
think you could stop him.

01:20:09.891 --> 01:20:12.361
He's one step ahead of you
at all times.

01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:17.899
You're already dead.

01:20:24.605 --> 01:20:27.072
<i>Roth, can you hear me? Roth?</i>

01:20:27.074 --> 01:20:29.841
<i>They seek
to control the planet</i>

01:20:29.843 --> 01:20:32.114
<i>and prevent the human race
from finding the truth.</i>

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.979
About the children?

01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:37.148
Yeah.

01:20:37.150 --> 01:20:42.554
They are using the children
for their own evil purposes.

01:20:42.556 --> 01:20:45.493
Their main priority
is to stop the awakening.

01:20:48.095 --> 01:20:49.795
What is the awakening?

01:20:49.797 --> 01:20:53.602
Well, quite simply, it is
the unlocking of one's true potential.

01:20:56.204 --> 01:20:58.837
You have to understand this,

01:20:58.839 --> 01:21:00.941
it's very difficult
to comprehend.

01:21:02.075 --> 01:21:04.011
I understand more
than you know.

01:21:07.114 --> 01:21:08.984
You said
we've met before.

01:21:13.154 --> 01:21:14.489
We have, indeed.

01:21:16.190 --> 01:21:19.959
Nearly, 5000 years ago.

01:21:19.961 --> 01:21:23.496
You were one of the oldest
souls in the universe, Evelyn.

01:21:23.498 --> 01:21:24.800
The first, in fact.

01:21:25.967 --> 01:21:28.003
Your necklace has been
drawing you to me.

01:21:29.136 --> 01:21:30.539
That's why they
are after you.

01:21:33.673 --> 01:21:36.144
This is a family heirloom.

01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:39.480
My mother gave it to me

01:21:40.013 --> 01:21:41.682
and her mother to her.

01:21:45.285 --> 01:21:46.887
I gave it to you.

01:21:49.123 --> 01:21:52.761
We must fast track your awakening, Evelyn.
We don't have much time.

01:21:54.294 --> 01:21:55.663
I can't finish it.

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:58.632
It can only be you.

01:22:08.543 --> 01:22:11.844
None of this is making
a difference, David.

01:22:11.846 --> 01:22:13.181
We should be sticking
to the mission.

01:22:14.015 --> 01:22:16.215
"The mission"?

01:22:16.217 --> 01:22:18.884
When the hell have you
ever stuck to the mission?

01:22:18.886 --> 01:22:20.553
You're lucky you're
even still here.

01:22:20.555 --> 01:22:22.153
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:22:22.155 --> 01:22:26.090
Hey. Look who I
found sneaking around.

01:22:26.092 --> 01:22:27.326
Where the hell
have you been?

01:22:27.328 --> 01:22:29.862
I've been trying
to reach you on the radio.

01:22:29.864 --> 01:22:33.799
I think that we found the sanctuary,
the woman's in there with them.

01:22:33.801 --> 01:22:36.838
Everyone's in position. We're
waiting to move in on your signal.

01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:51.853
Now,

01:22:53.186 --> 01:22:56.824
before I go and kill
your almighty Shepherd,

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:04.028
there's something I would
like to demonstrate for you.

01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:06.298
You see, it's just easier
that way, Michael.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.235
Death is inevitable
and all of us...

01:23:09.936 --> 01:23:12.071
the war has gone
on long enough.

01:23:12.073 --> 01:23:13.107
David,
what are you doing?

01:23:13.975 --> 01:23:15.176
Shut up.

01:23:18.012 --> 01:23:19.047
Now, hey.

01:23:21.348 --> 01:23:23.985
Hey, it's okay.

01:23:24.752 --> 01:23:25.754
It's okay.

01:23:27.288 --> 01:23:29.958
Now, is it a boy

01:23:31.057 --> 01:23:32.127
or a girl?

01:23:39.132 --> 01:23:41.869
Is it a boy or a girl,
Michael?

01:23:48.909 --> 01:23:50.278
Clearly, it's neither.

01:23:52.881 --> 01:23:54.947
Alice! No!

01:23:56.016 --> 01:23:57.151
Stop!

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.152
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:24:01.154 --> 01:24:03.023
Put the knife down
and back away.

01:24:04.225 --> 01:24:05.360
Do it, David.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.070
Who the hell do you
think you are?

01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:21.876
We took you in as one of our
own, you swore an oath.

01:24:22.743 --> 01:24:23.608
And, how do you repay us?

01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:26.711
Not by murdering
innocent people

01:24:26.713 --> 01:24:28.947
In the name of a war
that started so long ago,

01:24:28.949 --> 01:24:31.282
nobody even remembers
what it's about.

01:24:31.284 --> 01:24:35.289
My God. She's gotten
to you, hasn't she?

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.928
Hand your gun.

01:24:44.397 --> 01:24:45.800
Now.

01:24:51.771 --> 01:24:53.707
You're pathetic.

01:24:56.377 --> 01:24:59.881
This is bigger than them, Ethan.
It's bigger than you and me.

01:25:05.119 --> 01:25:07.022
How did my wife
really die?

01:25:25.306 --> 01:25:26.438
We need to go
warn them.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.508
No. She's dead
because of you.

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:33.478
Everybody else that you love will be
dead, too, if we don't warn them.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.848
You're all
that they have.

01:25:39.052 --> 01:25:41.021
Don't let her
death be in vain.

01:25:43.056 --> 01:25:44.458
You can still
save your people.

01:25:52.298 --> 01:25:54.368
Groups A and B are off-site.

01:25:58.838 --> 01:25:59.672
We're not protected.

01:26:02.275 --> 01:26:05.713
We'll come back for her,
I promise you.

01:26:10.885 --> 01:26:12.352
We need to get moving.

01:26:25.533 --> 01:26:28.533
Is there another
way in? Think!

01:26:28.535 --> 01:26:29.870
Other side of the rail.

01:26:32.205 --> 01:26:34.139
We're moving in!

01:26:35.275 --> 01:26:36.875
I said, now.

01:26:56.262 --> 01:26:57.397
This way.

01:27:03.904 --> 01:27:05.170
She'll be in the room
on the second left.

01:27:05.172 --> 01:27:06.304
What about you?

01:27:06.306 --> 01:27:07.374
We'll meet again.

01:27:13.513 --> 01:27:14.647
Open the door.

01:27:14.649 --> 01:27:17.519
I can't do that, my purpose
is to protect them.

01:27:20.186 --> 01:27:22.520
You hear that?
They're coming.

01:27:22.522 --> 01:27:25.122
I don't give a shit about
your orders. Open the door

01:27:25.124 --> 01:27:26.327
or we're all dead.

01:27:50.351 --> 01:27:51.986
Evelyn.

01:27:56.623 --> 01:28:00.294
I need to get you out of here.
They're coming.

01:28:07.501 --> 01:28:10.335
Do you even have a daughter?

01:28:10.337 --> 01:28:13.138
Everything I told you about
my family is true, Evelyn.

01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:17.309
My wife, my daughter,
they were my world.

01:28:17.311 --> 01:28:20.615
I promise I will tell you
everything but we have to go now.

01:28:22.248 --> 01:28:23.584
Leave me alone.

01:28:32.525 --> 01:28:33.894
Well...

01:28:45.405 --> 01:28:47.374
Well, doesn't this
feel surreal?

01:28:49.976 --> 01:28:53.411
Eighteen long years,
I've been searching for you

01:28:53.413 --> 01:28:55.479
and here you are.

01:28:55.481 --> 01:28:58.086
Not such a needle
in the haystack, after all.

01:29:00.721 --> 01:29:03.958
Six down, one to go.

01:29:09.663 --> 01:29:10.964
Bring him in.

01:29:15.436 --> 01:29:16.571
No!

01:29:20.641 --> 01:29:22.510
You see,
you can't win.

01:29:26.079 --> 01:29:27.281
This is the future.

01:29:32.586 --> 01:29:35.056
I've been waiting
so long for this.

01:29:37.524 --> 01:29:39.961
Where is the key?

01:29:48.635 --> 01:29:49.671
No!

01:29:54.408 --> 01:29:55.410
Thomas!

01:29:59.113 --> 01:30:00.114
Evelyn, run.

01:30:01.547 --> 01:30:02.647
Go!

01:30:18.699 --> 01:30:20.599
It all ends here.

01:30:20.601 --> 01:30:24.335
You're wrong, I'm
not important anymore.

01:30:24.337 --> 01:30:28.342
Things have already been set in
motion and you're one step behind.
