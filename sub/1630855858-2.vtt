It's not a war zone, not an apocalypse.
It's not her style.

then she found him first.

than preventing a Temporal meltdown?

- No. I'd stay focused

Renslayer killed C-20,

09:39.791 --> 09:42.333
attempted to kill Mobius,
threw me in Time Jail

09:42.333 --> 09:44.375
and tried to take over the TVA.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.833
Why would tracking her TemPad be a secret?

09:47.916 --> 09:50.083
- Right.
- Right.

09:50.208 --> 09:53.125
Right. But no, no hits.

09:53.125 --> 09:57.416
With Miss Minutes down,
the analysts are running traces manually.

09:57.416 --> 09:59.291
And with all the extra branches,

09:59.291 --> 10:01.958
it's like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

10:01.958 --> 10:04.458
But I did find something else.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.375
Renslayer erased the data from her TemPad,

10:08.375 --> 10:11.625
but I was able to piece together
who sent the last message.

10:12.541 --> 10:13.625
Who?

10:13.625 --> 10:15.375
I'll screw this back in, right?

10:15.375 --> 10:17.166
That's what it said on page seven.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.541
No. Section 42 should match
with the system manager.

10:19.541 --> 10:20.833
Is that with the red light?

10:20.833 --> 10:22.625
- We've tried that.
- Well, try it again.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.541
You didn't have
that pressed back, did you?

10:24.541 --> 10:25.916
It's too complicated.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.625
Am I on the wrong page or...

10:27.625 --> 10:29.541
I was just seeing upside down.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.750
- I can't focus. It's like gibberish.
- Mobius.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.166
Here's what'll help focus.
If we don't work this out,

10:34.166 --> 10:36.833
this place is gonna be destroyed.
Temporal meltdown or not.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.666
- Okay, I'll tell them.
- Casey, tell them what you just told me.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.666
Miss Minutes is helping Renslayer.

10:42.416 --> 10:44.875
- What?
- That explains the radio silence.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.958
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hang on.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.291
Um, when I was in the past,

10:51.375 --> 10:52.541
I heard something.

10:52.541 --> 10:56.750
An old conversation between Renslayer
and He Who Remains.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.833
It sounded like they were partners.

10:58.833 --> 11:02.458
She really is... Full of surprises.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.500
You can say that again.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.708
Where are they, Renslayer, Miss Minutes?

11:06.708 --> 11:08.500
Not sure, but I'll keep searching.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.875
If there's a hit on the TemPad,
I'll let you know.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.416
But it'll take some time, so...

11:13.875 --> 11:16.250
- How are things going here?
- No, not that great.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.708
It's all right. We'll get there.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.916
- When were you gonna tell us about...
- What is that?

11:19.916 --> 11:21.791
It's just a rigged TemPad.

11:21.791 --> 11:24.416
- What does it do?
- That's what we're trying to work out.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.625
X-5 says it somehow
blocks TVA tracking.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.250
That's not what it does.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.000
Sure.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.750
Yeah. Haven't you read the TVA Guidebook?

11:33.750 --> 11:37.291
- I mean, I haven't memorized it, but...
- CASEY: Uh-huh.

11:37.291 --> 11:40.791
It'll take me a while to analyze
the modifications,

11:40.791 --> 11:44.500
but this definitely doesn't block
any trackers, that's for sure.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.916
That's where we'll start with X-5.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.458
Let's take a run at Brad Wolfe.

11:50.458 --> 11:53.416
- Let's take a big run at him.
- Thank you.

11:58.666 --> 12:01.250
Okay, keep it simple. Where's Dox?

12:01.250 --> 12:04.125
Where's Sylvie?
And what did he do to that TemPad?

12:04.125 --> 12:06.458
That's all we need to find out. Okay?

12:06.458 --> 12:09.041
But of course, Brad knows us,
and he knows our tactics.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.583
But that's what makes for
an interesting chess match.

12:11.583 --> 12:14.041
Okay, most of all, Brad's an asshole.

12:14.041 --> 12:17.625
So, don't let him get under your skin,
all right? Okay? Loki?

12:17.625 --> 12:18.708
What?

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
Come on.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.708
Oh, welcome back. Why don't you go ahead
and take this Time Collar off

12:27.708 --> 12:30.083
and start treating me like
somebody who outranks you?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.500
- I don't work here.
- Oh, that's a good point.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.166
You should stop talking.

12:34.166 --> 12:38.166
Hey, what were you doing down there
on the Sacred Timeline?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.458
- Making movies.
- Don't waste our time, X-5.

12:41.458 --> 12:45.125
- It's Brad. Bradley.
- Right, Brad.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.583
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

12:47.583 --> 12:49.458
What did you do to this TemPad?

12:51.208 --> 12:54.375
- Answer the question.
- It blocks your trackers.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.708
- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, no shit.

12:56.708 --> 12:59.750
- What is it designed for, X-5?
- It's Brad.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.833
Under whose authority
are you holding me here?

13:01.833 --> 13:05.083
Looking around, I do not see anyone
ranking high to make that call.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.791
I don't need approval to detain a hunter
that abandoned his post.

13:08.791 --> 13:11.083
Oh, that's good. That's good.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.208
But weren't you the one
blabbering on and on

13:13.208 --> 13:15.333
about how we all had lives
on the timeline?

13:15.333 --> 13:19.041
Well, I went down and got my life.
What exactly are you mad at me about?

13:19.041 --> 13:20.291
There are lives at stake.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.583
There are lives at stake?

13:28.083 --> 13:29.958
Oh, you've got some nerve.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.125
"There are lives at stake."

13:35.666 --> 13:37.791
Everyone here knows
what you're doing, you know?

13:38.875 --> 13:42.375
You're just trying to make up
for all the terrible,

13:42.375 --> 13:46.250
awful shit you've done in your life,
you pathetic little man.

13:46.250 --> 13:49.333
- Okay, that's enough.
- No, no, Mobius. No, it's...

13:50.833 --> 13:52.541
It's riveting.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.958
- Keep going. I want to hear more.
- Good.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.833
See, everything you and Sylvie have
ever done to try to help,

14:00.750 --> 14:03.375
- has only ever made it worse.
- Is that right?

14:03.875 --> 14:05.166
See, I've read your file.

14:06.291 --> 14:09.166
It's you. You're the problem.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.041
Every time we've ever found a you.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.791
Problem is, you think you're special,
but you're not.

14:15.791 --> 14:18.791
So, it doesn't matter
what outfit you put on,

14:18.791 --> 14:21.583
play dress up or what little lies
you tell your friends

14:21.583 --> 14:23.625
or even the lies you tell yourself.

14:23.625 --> 14:27.583
At the end of the day,
you just make everything worse.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.375
For Mobius, for B-15,

14:32.333 --> 14:33.541
for your mother.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.833
'Cause that's what you do.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.250
You lose. You're a loser.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.875
- MOBIUS: Loki.
- (EXHALES)

14:43.875 --> 14:47.000
Stop trying to be a hero, man.

14:49.208 --> 14:50.500
You're a villain.

14:51.458 --> 14:55.166
And you're good at it. Do that.

14:56.541 --> 14:58.625
(CHUCKLES)

15:03.750 --> 15:05.125
Thank you, Brad...

15:06.708 --> 15:08.083
very much.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.208
I really am touched.

15:13.166 --> 15:15.166
You know, you're right.

15:15.166 --> 15:19.625
I have done some terrible, awful things.

15:20.541 --> 15:23.208
Yeah, maybe that is who I am,
and he knows.

15:25.083 --> 15:29.166
It's the real me. (CLAPS) A loser.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.666
Always have been. Always will be.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.250
And perhaps I've been...

15:40.916 --> 15:43.000
- holding something back.
- Loki.

15:43.916 --> 15:48.916
Perhaps I've just been biding my time.

15:50.208 --> 15:55.333
Perhaps I've just been waiting
for a moment like this,

15:56.666 --> 15:59.625
so I can do terrible,

16:00.958 --> 16:04.125
awful things to you.

16:06.541 --> 16:08.750
So, let's try this one more time.

16:09.833 --> 16:13.583
Where is Sylvie?

16:17.500 --> 16:19.750
You're way too obsessed with her.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.666
He needs therapy.

16:22.666 --> 16:24.500
- I can recommend someone...
- Okay. Come on.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.541
...if you wanna work that out.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.541
Control your little pet, Mobius.

16:32.916 --> 16:34.333
That got a little tense.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.666
Hey, you wanna hear a good one?
Knock, knock.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.916
- HUNTER X-5: Who's there?
- Brad.

16:42.875 --> 16:45.333
- Brad, who?
- That's showbiz.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.875
And I don't want that to happen to you.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.125
So, play along with us,
answer our questions

16:52.125 --> 16:54.958
and we'll get you back there,
so they don't forget about you.

16:54.958 --> 16:56.583
How's that sound?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.750
- You would do that?
- I will.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.208
- You promise?
- I promise.

17:04.708 --> 17:08.208
You seeing this?
Mobius, you could be an actor.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.208
I'm not an actor, I'm an analyst.
But thank you.

17:12.208 --> 17:14.583
You're not an analyst.
I'm not a hunter.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.958
None of this is real.

17:16.958 --> 17:20.333
I mean, who even are you on the timeline,
do you know?

17:22.125 --> 17:23.125
Doesn't matter.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.541
I think it does matter because
none of this is real.

17:25.541 --> 17:28.708
- Well, okay.
- The TVA is not your real home.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.458
Mobius isn't even your real name.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.833
Well, it's what I answer to.

17:33.833 --> 17:37.375
Do you have any idea what kind of life
you might have left behind?

17:37.375 --> 17:40.583
Who might be waiting for you back there?
I mean, do you care?

17:40.583 --> 17:43.291
I mean, you know they took us.

17:43.291 --> 17:47.041
You know they took our lives,
and you're still here.

17:47.041 --> 17:50.625
I mean, it's kind of weird, man.
I mean, you need to wake up.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.541
- I'm awake.
- Yeah, no. You're asleep.

17:52.541 --> 17:54.875
- You need to wake up, Mobius.
- I'm awake.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.833
- And until you do, you're nothing.
- No.

17:57.833 --> 18:01.708
She is nothing. I don't know where to
start with that, but you're nothing here.

18:01.708 --> 18:05.500
And until you wake up,
you're just a nowhere man. You're a...

18:05.500 --> 18:08.500
You're a nowhere man!
You're a silly little man.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.333
- Whoa!
- Silly little man.

18:10.666 --> 18:11.666
Whoa!

18:12.625 --> 18:16.083
Mobius! Yes!

18:22.458 --> 18:24.083
- LOKI: What was that?
- Nothing.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.583
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.416
- What happened back there?
- Nothing.

18:27.416 --> 18:29.625
- Didn't seem like nothing.
- It was tactical.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.000
- Seems like he got under your skin.
- Nope.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.750
He didn't get under my skin.
He got under your skin.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.500
Mobius, are you all right?
I've never seen you like this before.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.541
- Seen me like what?
- Okay, I'm not judging.

18:40.541 --> 18:44.666
Feels like you are. Look, I told you
I can play the heavy keys and I can...

18:44.666 --> 18:46.750
- Where are we?
- I was following you.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.625
No, I was following you.

18:49.875 --> 18:51.875
Mobius. You were clearly ahead of me.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.208
How about a slice of pie?

18:59.458 --> 19:01.916
- Key lime.
- Okay, great. Come on.

19:14.916 --> 19:16.500
Mmm.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.583
It's really good.

19:22.708 --> 19:23.708
It is.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.166
Listen. That wasn't tactical.

19:34.416 --> 19:35.541
I lost it.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.000
It's okay.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.875
- Look, it happens.
- Hmm.

19:43.458 --> 19:47.666
You know, sometimes a rage builds up
and you just gotta... let it out.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.041
Do you remember that time

19:52.041 --> 19:54.541
I was so angry with
my father and my brother,

19:54.541 --> 19:56.500
I went down to Earth

19:56.500 --> 19:59.666
and I held the whole of New York City
hostage with an alien army?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.666
Tried to use the Mind Stone on Tony Stark.

20:02.666 --> 20:05.125
It didn't work,
so I threw him off the building.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.666
I mean, let me tell you something.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.750
- Wasn't tactical.
- Yeah.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.041
I lost it.

20:12.416 --> 20:14.875
Sometimes our emotions
get the better of us.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.458
You can say that again.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.250
Let me ask you something.

20:21.791 --> 20:24.875
X-5, you know, he obviously

20:24.875 --> 20:26.750
touched a nerve, right?

20:28.250 --> 20:30.583
You've never wanted to visit
your place on the timeline?

20:33.333 --> 20:36.250
Look, that's the last thing
I should be thinking about.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.500
Are you-- Aren't you curious?

20:38.500 --> 20:41.125
Don't you want to see the life
you were supposed to live

20:41.125 --> 20:43.708
before they kidnapped you
and brought you into the TVA?

20:43.708 --> 20:46.041
- Not really.
- Why?

20:46.041 --> 20:48.666
- Because it's not my life.
- But it could have been.

20:48.666 --> 20:50.375
It isn't. This is.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.500
I'd like to thank the guy who kidnapped me
and brought me here.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.958
Got me this pie.

20:57.041 --> 20:58.625
If you never look, you'll never know.

20:59.500 --> 21:03.500
The TVA is the only life I've ever known.
I like it.

21:04.250 --> 21:08.541
Look, I understand that. I get it,
you know, you might think twice in case...

21:09.333 --> 21:11.291
it's something bad and you...

21:11.291 --> 21:14.375
Or something good.
Something bad, I can handle.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.000
What if it's something good?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.916
Do you think I wanna have that
rattling around in here?

21:19.750 --> 21:21.083
- Of course not.
- Sure.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.958
You know, X-5 isn't gonna talk.

21:37.625 --> 21:40.416
X-5 is gonna talk.
We just have to find a way in.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.208
All right. So what aren't we
asking this time?

21:43.208 --> 21:47.541
Look, X-5 is a good hunter, okay?

21:47.541 --> 21:49.750
He's very good at his job.

21:49.750 --> 21:53.666
So, does it really make sense that
he could spend all that time down there

21:53.666 --> 21:55.041
and not find Sylvie?

21:55.958 --> 21:59.500
Look, Sylvie spent her whole life hiding.
He didn't find her.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.500
Yes, but maybe he got
a little help from that TemPad.

22:02.500 --> 22:06.208
Okay. If he found her and walked away,

22:07.416 --> 22:09.916
then she didn't know he found her.
That makes sense.

22:09.916 --> 22:14.583
Think about it. He found her,
but maybe didn't turn her in

22:14.583 --> 22:18.083
because he wants to continue to live
his best life on the timeline.

22:18.083 --> 22:20.416
- He wants more time to be Brad Wolfe.
- Who wouldn't?

22:20.416 --> 22:21.833
Right.

22:21.833 --> 22:24.625
Now, we just have to find a way
to get him to admit it.

22:25.541 --> 22:27.916
He's the only one who knows
where Sylvie is.

22:27.916 --> 22:29.250
Just gotta make him talk.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.541
Well, come on. You're the God of Mischief.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.708
Right?

22:35.958 --> 22:37.958
WOMAN OVER PA:
<i>Loom status unstable.</i>

22:37.958 --> 22:39.916
<i>Please take immediate action.</i>

22:49.291 --> 22:51.666
<i>Loom status unstable.</i>

22:51.666 --> 22:54.041
<i>Please take immediate action.</i>

23:09.291 --> 23:11.916
(COMPUTER BUZZES)

23:11.916 --> 23:14.541
- (COMPUTER BUZZES)
- Hmm.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.083
Oh, no.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.500
(CLANGING IN DISTANCE)

23:41.291 --> 23:42.458
Hi.

23:45.500 --> 23:49.666
Hello, Loki. Ready for round two?

23:49.666 --> 23:53.708
I felt like I just,
need another session, you know?

23:53.708 --> 23:55.166
Get a few things off my chest.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.000
Gonna try the hardball tactics this time?

24:00.125 --> 24:02.333
- Something like that.
- Okay.

24:25.916 --> 24:27.625
Where's B-15?

24:28.791 --> 24:30.916
She's not gonna be attending this session.

24:30.916 --> 24:33.333
Oh, I get it. So, you come in here
without B-15

24:33.333 --> 24:36.083
and I'm supposed to believe
you're gonna torture me, Mobius?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.958
Well, let's simplify everything.

24:37.958 --> 24:41.125
You have information that we need.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.250
You don't want to give it to us.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.750
So, how do we find common ground?

24:45.750 --> 24:49.666
- You are gettin' desperate.
- You're not wrong. He's not wrong.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.250
We're definitely getting desperate.

24:51.250 --> 24:54.708
And I'll be honest with you,
we're down to our last option.

24:54.708 --> 24:57.125
- And your last chance.
- This is cute.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.000
Which one of you came up with this script?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Because you're a tough nut to crack,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.125
you've left us no choice
but to kind of ramp...

25:03.125 --> 25:05.291
Mobius, controller.

25:05.750 --> 25:08.500
- (SCOFFS)
- Right, okay.

25:08.500 --> 25:12.083
We can't start the festivities
without that little baby. Stand by.

25:13.958 --> 25:14.958
Wow!

25:24.458 --> 25:27.708
- (SIGHS)
- Hey, open up.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.666
- Hey. Loki?
- Turns out,

25:31.666 --> 25:35.541
there is actually one other option.

25:35.541 --> 25:37.416
No, no! Hey!

25:38.541 --> 25:41.333
You sniffed us out, Brad.

25:41.333 --> 25:44.291
And I knew you would,
because you're a clever chap.

25:44.291 --> 25:47.666
So guess what?
I wrote a little script of my own.

25:47.666 --> 25:49.916
Loki. Loki, this isn't right. Open up!

25:51.083 --> 25:54.166
That thing does not work without
the controller, though, so...

25:55.500 --> 25:56.708
What're you gonna do?

25:59.041 --> 26:00.041
This one?

26:01.958 --> 26:05.541
Okay, great.
We're gonna have a little Q and A.

26:07.083 --> 26:11.166
Did you find Sylvie?
And if you did, where is she?

26:12.208 --> 26:17.208
Simple question, really, but doesn't mean
we can't enjoy ourselves as we go along.

26:18.833 --> 26:20.875
This one's plugged in.

26:20.875 --> 26:22.250
You almost got me.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.375
You have no idea how to work that thing.

26:27.833 --> 26:29.583
I'm not trying to be a hero, Brad.

26:30.958 --> 26:34.125
I'm a villain. Remember?

26:34.125 --> 26:35.750
No. Loki.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.666
This isn't the kind of mischief
I was talking about!

26:38.666 --> 26:41.750
Hey! Loki, you're not a villain.
You're not...

26:41.750 --> 26:43.625
- (MACHINE WHIRRS)
- Look at that.

26:44.416 --> 26:48.416
Um, earlier, I said some
really hurtful things,

26:48.958 --> 26:53.500
and I brought up your mother.
And I am really sorry about that.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.791
- Mobius! Hey, get in here!
- It's locked, Brad. It's locked!

27:01.458 --> 27:02.666
You need to put that down.

27:02.666 --> 27:05.083
That's... you don't know
what you're doing with that.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.000
What does this one do?

27:13.583 --> 27:17.041
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.
Could've hurt yourself there.

27:17.041 --> 27:20.291
Hey, don't just touch random buttons
on that, okay?

27:20.291 --> 27:21.458
Mobius, get in here.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.500
There's a learning curve with this thing.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.958
Yeah. There is a learning curve.

27:24.958 --> 27:26.541
You could kill me with that.

27:26.541 --> 27:27.625
Could I?

27:29.666 --> 27:31.375
(GASPS)

27:35.666 --> 27:37.583
This is exciting.

27:37.583 --> 27:38.958
Turn it off.

27:40.583 --> 27:41.833
Loki, turn it off.

27:41.833 --> 27:45.625
- Let me try this. Let me try this.
- (MACHINE BEEPS)

27:45.625 --> 27:48.083
Okay. Okay. All right.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.250
Sorry. That's only made it smaller.

27:51.250 --> 27:56.666
Now, look. I don't know where Dox
and the others are. Okay? I don't know.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.541
I don't if you know this,

27:58.541 --> 28:03.333
but I've done some terrible, awful things.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.625
Yeah, you have.
You're doing one right now.

28:05.625 --> 28:09.000
Have some perspective on yourself.
(GASPS) Okay!

28:09.708 --> 28:10.708
Okay.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.833
Okay.

28:12.833 --> 28:14.166
Trial and error.

28:14.166 --> 28:18.708
(CHUCKLES) I swear I don't know
where they are.

28:18.708 --> 28:21.958
Brad. You're so convincing.

28:21.958 --> 28:25.541
I want to believe you, but you're just--
You're such a good actor.

28:25.541 --> 28:28.833
Look, I really,
I really don't know. I swear.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.166
You're so talented.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.750
- They did not tell me the plan.
- Please tell me the truth.

28:32.750 --> 28:35.708
- I know you're lying.
- Okay? Okay, okay.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.666
I lied. I lied, okay? I did.

28:37.666 --> 28:42.458
I was supposed to go look for Sylvie,
but then, I bailed, okay? I bailed.

28:42.458 --> 28:46.291
Right. So, they told you to go
after Sylvie and you bailed?

28:46.291 --> 28:47.625
Yeah.

28:47.625 --> 28:52.291
What's the penalty for a highly-decorated
field officer abandoning his mission?

28:52.833 --> 28:54.708
You and Dox, I don't buy it.

28:57.500 --> 29:01.666
(GASPS) Okay. Look, I swear, okay?

29:01.666 --> 29:04.291
I went down there,
and I went to get my life, okay?

29:04.291 --> 29:06.083
Because... none of this is real.

29:06.083 --> 29:09.250
Well, if none of this is real,
I guess you aren't either.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.875
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait.

29:17.541 --> 29:21.625
- (GRUNTS)
- Just tell me where Sylvie is, Brad.

29:21.625 --> 29:22.708
All right.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.833
I'll tell you where she is.

29:25.958 --> 29:27.708
She has a new life!

29:30.833 --> 29:32.500
There you go.

29:33.291 --> 29:34.625
Got there in the end.

29:36.583 --> 29:38.833
Why do you make it so hard
on yourself, Brad?

29:45.708 --> 29:49.083
One thing, you said
you bailed on the mission.

29:50.791 --> 29:54.000
Yeah, but I found her first.
She's on a branch.

29:56.875 --> 29:58.458
- He knows where Sylvie is.
- See?

29:58.458 --> 30:00.875
- Little bit of mischief.
- Only as good as your plan.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.625
Thank you. Let's go, Zaniac.

30:02.625 --> 30:05.666
- Are you telling me that was--
- Hell of a performance.

30:05.666 --> 30:07.791
If I tell you where she is,
you'll let me go?

30:07.791 --> 30:09.291
No. You're gonna show us.

30:13.916 --> 30:17.208
Hey, O.B., this is Casey.
I thought he could help.

30:17.208 --> 30:19.833
- O.B.: We're all gonna die!
- O.B.?

30:22.958 --> 30:24.458
We're all gonna die!

30:24.458 --> 30:26.750
Oh. Hey, nice to meet you.

30:26.750 --> 30:29.208
- We're all gonna die.
- What do you mean?

30:30.958 --> 30:32.333
The blast doors won't open.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.375
Did you try the C-12 bypass pathway?

30:35.375 --> 30:36.458
That won't work.

30:36.458 --> 30:39.458
- Are you sure?
- Of course. I wrote it.

30:42.333 --> 30:43.375
Wait...

30:45.458 --> 30:46.958
You're Ouroboros?

30:47.958 --> 30:51.375
- Yes.
- You wrote the TVA Guidebook.

30:51.375 --> 30:54.958
- You've read it?
- Read it? I practically memorized it.

30:57.041 --> 30:58.708
Will you sign mine for me?

30:58.708 --> 31:02.166
- Of course I will. Happy to do it.
- Yeah, just next to your picture.

31:02.166 --> 31:03.250
Hold on.

31:03.250 --> 31:05.166
You just said we were all gonna die.

31:05.166 --> 31:08.041
Oh, right. The containment doors
are locked,

31:08.041 --> 31:09.833
and only the person who designed it

31:09.833 --> 31:12.291
can open it with a live scan
of his temporal aura.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.416
He Who Remains.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.250
And he's dead.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.291
So without Miss Minutes to help us
override the lock, we're stuck.

31:22.291 --> 31:23.833
So, we have to convince

31:23.833 --> 31:26.958
a rogue artificial intelligence
to come back to work?

31:26.958 --> 31:29.833
Whatever we're doing, we gotta do it fast.

31:29.958 --> 31:31.708
The more those branches grow,

31:31.708 --> 31:34.166
the closer this thing
comes to melting down.

31:34.833 --> 31:36.166
I'll build the device,

31:36.166 --> 31:39.083
but you need to find a way in
or it won't matter.

31:45.208 --> 31:47.458
- Brad, walk.
- Brad, I'm telling you right now,

31:47.458 --> 31:50.375
if you're wasting our time,
you're going right back in the Gizmo.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.500
Would you like getting scrunched up
in the cube?

31:52.500 --> 31:55.416
Hey, hey, hey! Okay. All right.
Look, she's in there, all right.

31:55.416 --> 31:58.250
She's in there.
So, why don't you guys

31:58.250 --> 32:01.708
just head on in and remember that
I'm the one who brought you here,

32:01.708 --> 32:03.375
and a deal's a deal. All right?

32:03.375 --> 32:05.500
So, you go ahead,
I'm gonna head on back.

32:05.500 --> 32:08.125
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why are you so jumpy?

32:08.125 --> 32:11.000
- It's making me nervous.
- I'm not jumpy. I'm not nervous.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.625
- All right.
- Yeah, you're like, you wanna take off.

32:13.625 --> 32:17.333
I just don't wanna be around a Variant
who killed 400 of our co-workers.

32:17.333 --> 32:19.958
So I'm just gonna...
If you just open the door...

32:24.791 --> 32:26.083
What do you think?

32:27.125 --> 32:30.625
If she's here,
I have to find out what she knows.

32:32.041 --> 32:33.625
I'll do the talking. Be ready.

32:38.291 --> 32:41.000
Hey, can you refill the straw dispenser
when you get a sec?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.208
Already done it.

32:43.875 --> 32:45.041
Bill, order's up.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.708
MAN: Thanks, Sylvie.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.666
This feels tense.

33:09.666 --> 33:12.750
What do you say we leave them to it.
We head on back to the TVA.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.208
What are you talking about? No.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.583
I'm not going anywhere
until I get some apple pie.

33:16.583 --> 33:17.916
No, no, no, no, no.

33:32.791 --> 33:33.791
Hi.

33:37.416 --> 33:38.541
Hi.

33:43.166 --> 33:46.541
Listen, I haven't got all day.
You're gonna order something? Or, what?

33:46.541 --> 33:47.833
Can we talk?

33:50.583 --> 33:52.000
My break's in five minutes.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.666
It's a short break, so talk fast.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.750
Uh, I know I'm the last person
you want to see.

34:26.750 --> 34:27.916
Correct.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.333
(SIGHS)

34:33.791 --> 34:34.791
I, uh...

34:37.041 --> 34:38.625
I haven't come here to make trouble.

34:38.625 --> 34:40.333
Then why are you here?

34:42.708 --> 34:46.916
Uh... this is gonna sound strange.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.583
But... there's been a problem.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.833
It's complicated.

34:57.583 --> 35:01.250
I've been pulled through time.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.291
Between the past and the present.
I was in the past...

35:05.291 --> 35:07.000
Oh, just get to the point, Loki.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.041
Sylvie, I was in the future and I saw you.

35:11.208 --> 35:15.291
The TVA is in danger. And you were there.
I need to know why.

35:15.291 --> 35:17.500
So you see the future now? Cool.

35:18.958 --> 35:20.333
It's not something I chose.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.916
Look, as much as I'd love to see
the TVA burnt to the ground,

35:24.916 --> 35:27.000
I have no intention of going back there.

35:28.583 --> 35:32.208
My life's here now, and I'm not running.
I'm happy.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.291
Explain what I saw, then.

35:34.291 --> 35:37.833
- I don't know. I don't care.
- It's the future. It's going to happen.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.208
Is it? Really?

35:39.208 --> 35:42.583
Because that sounds a lot like
the future's already been written.

35:42.583 --> 35:44.875
And we both know that it hasn't.
Not anymore.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.541
I made sure of that.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.500
Enchant me. You can see what I saw.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.166
I don't want to see.
I want nothing to do with this.

35:53.166 --> 35:54.291
I have no answers.

35:54.291 --> 35:57.958
If we don't work together, I can't
guarantee how long this will be here.

35:57.958 --> 35:59.750
- You have some nerve coming.
- Nerve?

36:01.125 --> 36:04.041
This is bigger than the TVA.
This is about everything.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.666
You like it here?

36:06.666 --> 36:09.333
You like this place? You've made a home?

36:10.041 --> 36:12.083
If what He Who Remains said is true,

36:12.083 --> 36:15.416
the TVA is the only defense.

36:15.416 --> 36:17.000
And if what I saw of you is true,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.541
then there's nothing that stands between
this world and utter destruction.

36:20.541 --> 36:22.833
Without the TVA,
all of this, everything...

36:24.833 --> 36:26.208
is gone.

36:26.208 --> 36:27.291
Mmm.

36:27.708 --> 36:30.125
I thought you were setting us up
for an ambush.

36:30.125 --> 36:33.625
Hell, you were just setting us
up for a great meal. Thank you.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.333
What is happening right now?

36:35.333 --> 36:38.791
They're going over every detail of
their relationship that's ever happened.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.750
Look. It's a complicated
relationship, okay?

36:40.750 --> 36:42.875
There's a lot to unpack
when you're basically

36:42.875 --> 36:45.000
- in a relationship with yourself.
- Yeah.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.541
They say opposites attract. No.

36:47.541 --> 36:48.791
What is this?

36:49.958 --> 36:50.958
God, it's weird.

36:51.416 --> 36:53.375
- But I brought you Sylvie. I did that.
- Yeah.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.000
I held up my end of the bargain.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.166
- You hold up your end of the bargain.
- I will.

36:57.166 --> 36:59.875
And you get me back
to the Sacred Timeline, like you said.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.666
Can we just talk for a second,
about how crazy life is?

37:02.666 --> 37:03.958
I mean, ten minutes ago,

37:03.958 --> 37:06.208
you were screaming at me,
"You're nothing!"

37:06.208 --> 37:09.583
And then I kind of freaked out
and basically tortured you.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.000
And now here we are,

37:11.000 --> 37:12.833
enjoying a meal like gentlemen.

37:12.833 --> 37:14.958
You slapped me in the face.
I won't forget...

37:14.958 --> 37:16.458
But I got you a shake. Okay?

37:17.833 --> 37:21.333
Look, just enjoy this.
Tell me about <i>Zaniac.</i>

37:21.333 --> 37:23.166
- What about it?
- I wanna know about it.

37:23.166 --> 37:24.958
- Oh, come on.
- Can... Please.

37:24.958 --> 37:27.791
- You don't care about my movie.
- Brad, I saw the poster.

37:27.791 --> 37:30.500
- It looked scary.
- It's not. It's not.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.916
It's not scary.
It's elevated thriller, all right?

37:33.916 --> 37:36.291
- It is? Yeah?
- It's cinema. Thank you very much.

37:36.291 --> 37:39.625
You can't see it. Get your own tickets.
Not hooking you up. Not after this.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.708
I will. I will.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.791
Look, why don't we just get this to go?

37:43.791 --> 37:45.625
How about that? It packs right up.

37:45.625 --> 37:48.708
Let's just get it to go
and we get up and we get out of here.

37:48.708 --> 37:51.166
- How about that?
- You're like a broken record.

37:51.166 --> 37:53.375
It's like, "Get me back
to the Sacred Timeline."

37:53.375 --> 37:55.666
Although now it's just,
"Get me out of here."

37:57.416 --> 37:58.791
Is this a setup?

38:00.083 --> 38:03.291
Hey. Hey. What's going on?

38:04.791 --> 38:06.166
Nothing.

38:08.208 --> 38:09.750
I've got to get back to work.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.583
You'll give everyone free will
and walk away?

38:12.583 --> 38:14.791
That's the way it works. You're welcome.

38:14.791 --> 38:18.875
(SIGHS) He shows up again, his Variants,
what are you gonna do?

38:19.541 --> 38:20.958
Kill 'em.

38:20.958 --> 38:23.166
Sorry to interrupt.
I think Brad's got something

38:23.166 --> 38:25.083
that he might want to get off his chest.

38:25.083 --> 38:27.375
<i>Zaniac's</i> getting a sequel.
And you're both invited.

38:27.375 --> 38:29.958
- Hey, we can wait all day.
- No, we can't.

38:29.958 --> 38:32.041
We need to talk about this
back at the TVA.

38:32.041 --> 38:34.208
- No. We can talk here. Now.
- Now.

38:34.208 --> 38:37.458
Fine. If we stay here,
we're all gonna die.

38:38.041 --> 38:41.041
They're gonna die.
Orange shirt, she's gonna die.

38:41.041 --> 38:43.416
Most importantly, we are all gonna die.

38:43.416 --> 38:46.125
This is gone! Unless we...

38:47.000 --> 38:50.125
- All this for Sylvie?
- I don't buy it.

38:52.291 --> 38:55.083
- They're gonna bomb every branch.
- Yeah, including this one.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.250
- Where do we go?
- I'll show you.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.291
- B-15, incoming. Let's go.
- Great.

39:00.958 --> 39:02.958
WOMAN: Are we pruning timelines now?

39:02.958 --> 39:05.250
CASEY: Targets are popping up
all over the branches.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.583
HUNTER B-15: We need to know
where this attack is coming from.

39:09.458 --> 39:12.166
MAN 2: What's happening?
HUNTER B-15: Mobius. What is going on?

39:12.166 --> 39:13.833
MOBIUS: <i>Dox wasn't looking for Sylvie.</i>

39:13.833 --> 39:15.958
<i>She's gonna prune all the new branches.</i>

39:15.958 --> 39:19.625
She already is.
Mobius, she's gonna kill them all.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.083
MAN 3: No pattern to it.

39:21.083 --> 39:22.791
Start tracking those charges.

39:25.708 --> 39:28.791
MAN 4: How are you on supplies?
MAN 5: Low on reset charges.

39:28.791 --> 39:30.583
What are they doing with the Time Doors?

39:30.583 --> 39:32.541
Looks like they're connected
to the TemPads.

39:32.541 --> 39:35.041
MOBIUS: Maybe that's why
Brad's was modified.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.166
MALE ANALYST:
They've pruned 30% of the branches.

39:38.166 --> 39:39.958
Is Mobius on the ground yet?

39:39.958 --> 39:42.583
HUNTER B-15:
<i>Mobius, they're killing billions.</i>

39:42.583 --> 39:44.125
<i>Take Dox down now.</i>

39:44.125 --> 39:45.875
Minutemen are carrying reset charges.

39:45.875 --> 39:48.583
SYLVIE: That's how they're bombing
all the timelines at once.

39:48.583 --> 39:50.208
Connected to that control panel.

39:50.208 --> 39:52.041
MOBIUS: That's our target.

39:52.166 --> 39:54.125
- I'll distract them.
- Okay.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.958
Our mission is compromised.

40:02.958 --> 40:04.708
Set off what you can!

40:10.083 --> 40:13.041
We have to stop this.
Can we disarm the charges?

40:13.041 --> 40:16.583
It's possible if we can track them,
but there's too many. I'm gonna call O.B.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.208
MAN: Over here!

40:24.458 --> 40:26.875
We're too late. Finish it!

40:40.625 --> 40:42.333
Don't overthink it.

40:57.208 --> 40:58.916
Is this all of Dox's loyalists?

40:59.583 --> 41:01.000
Everyone who didn't escape.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.458
HUNTER B-15: <i>Mobius,
you should come back.</i>

41:04.708 --> 41:06.125
Loki, we need to go.

41:41.416 --> 41:42.916
Those are people.

41:49.125 --> 41:50.833
Those are lives.

41:59.416 --> 42:01.791
(DEVICE BEEPS)

42:04.041 --> 42:07.416
Uh, guys,
I got a hit on Renslayer's TemPad.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.291
- Sylvie...
- Is this the best you lot can do?

42:37.125 --> 42:38.750
There was nothing we could do.

42:40.250 --> 42:41.541
Some defense.

42:43.791 --> 42:48.250
The TVA is the problem.
It's broken, it's rotten.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.000
I'm going home... if it's still there.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.375
Please, don't. It's harder...

42:58.625 --> 42:59.750
to stay.

43:32.708 --> 43:36.708
(MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKER)

43:42.041 --> 43:44.458
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)
Hey, Sylvie. You okay?

43:45.750 --> 43:49.208
- Just wanted to check.
- Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

43:50.208 --> 43:51.416
No problem.

43:52.083 --> 43:54.958
Um, do you think
you'll be in tomorrow, though?

43:55.916 --> 43:57.000
Yeah.

43:58.458 --> 44:02.166
- Cool, cool. Mmm-hmm.
- Jack?

44:02.333 --> 44:04.625
Is your mum on her way to pick you up?

44:04.625 --> 44:07.875
Yeah. She'll be here. I'm good.

44:10.708 --> 44:11.833
Good night.

44:11.833 --> 44:13.208
Bye-bye. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
