WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:07.268
PIPER, IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

00:07.442 --> 00:08.530
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE?

00:08.704 --> 00:10.488
THEY VANQUISHED
THE UNVANQUISHABLE--

00:10.662 --> 00:13.056
YEAH, THAT JUST
MAKES THEM POWERFUL
THOUGH, NOT BAD.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.841
DON'T BE SO NAIVE.
CHRISTY WAS RAISED
BY THE TRIAD...

00:16.016 --> 00:17.365
WHO WANTED US
DEAD, REMEMBER?

00:17.539 --> 00:18.409
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.584
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT

00:19.758 --> 00:20.890
BILLIE AND CHRISTY
WANT US DEAD.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.544
[SCOFFS] THEY ARE
THE ULTIMATE POWER.

00:22.718 --> 00:25.721
THEY WERE CHOSEN
TO TAKE US OUT,
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?

00:25.895 --> 00:28.289
NO, ACTUALLY,
I DON'T

00:28.463 --> 00:30.465
LOOK, I MEAN, YEAH,
IT'S A POSSIBILITY,

00:30.639 --> 00:31.683
BUT WE'RE NOT
THERE YET.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.511
AREN'T WE?

00:33.685 --> 00:35.600
AH! OK.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.211
WITCH,
WHITELIGHTER,
WIFE--

00:37.385 --> 00:39.604
I GIVE UP, HOW
DO I JUGGLE
ALL THIS?

00:42.607 --> 00:44.044
MMM. WHAT ARE
WE ARGUING
ABOUT?

00:44.218 --> 00:45.871
THE ULTIMATE
POWER, WHAT ELSE?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.395
HER NAME IS BILLIE.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.484
AND I THINK WE
SHOULD HELP HER,
NOT HURT HER.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.921
OK. WHAT IF SHE
TRIES TO HURT US
FIRST? THEN, WHAT?

00:52.095 --> 00:53.662
DING, DING!

00:53.836 --> 00:55.316
BACK TO YOUR
CORNERS.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.361
HERE IS THE DEAL.
THIS IS DIFFICULT
FOR US, RIGHT?

00:57.535 --> 01:00.277
SO, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY TRY TO BE
NICE TO EACH OTHER.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.411
SPECIALLY HARD ON
ME. JEEZ! SHE USED
TO BE IN MY CHARGE.

01:03.585 --> 01:04.847
SO YOU'RE
SAYING, WHAT?

01:05.021 --> 01:06.066
THAT YOU SIDE
WITH PHOEBE?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.806
NO, I DIDN'T
SAY THAT AT ALL.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.591
ALL I'M SAYING IS
IT'S MESSING WITH
ALL OF OUR LIVES.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.681
YOU WITH P3 AND
THE BOYS. YOU
WITH WORK AND CUPID.

01:12.855 --> 01:13.812
MICHAEL...

01:15.249 --> 01:17.381
AND ME, LUCKY
LITTLE ME,

01:17.555 --> 01:20.471
I AM STUCK WITH
ANOTHER FUTURE
WHITELIGHTER.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.604
WHICH MEANS I DON'T
EVEN GET TO SEE
MY NEW HUSBAND.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.301
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU HAVE A HUSBAND.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.260
I'M STILL TRYING
TO GET MINE BACK.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.913
AND I'M STILL
TRYING TO FIND
A HUSBAND,

01:28.088 --> 01:30.916
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WE CAN'T-- WHAT?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.441
OH, DEAR,
SHE'S IN
TROUBLE!

01:33.615 --> 01:35.704
IS THIS EVER
GONNA END?

01:38.881 --> 01:40.752
I'M GOING GO
TRY TO MAKE A POTION.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.232
TO DO WHAT?

01:42.406 --> 01:44.016
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

01:44.191 --> 01:46.497
OK, BUT I JUST DON'T
THINK I'M READY FOR
THIS, RIGHT NOW.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.108
YOU BETTER
GET READY!

01:49.500 --> 01:51.285
[SIGHS]

01:53.025 --> 01:55.115
ARGH!
OH!

01:57.029 --> 01:58.335
[GASPS]
HOLY CRAP!

02:00.163 --> 02:01.295
DUCK! ARROW!

02:03.688 --> 02:05.734
PAIGE, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND. WHERE
DID YOU COME FROM?

02:05.908 --> 02:06.996
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.910
HEY, COLIN!

03:35.084 --> 03:37.217
DID YOU COME
VISIT YOUR DADDY
TODAY AT WORK?

03:37.391 --> 03:39.131
YEAH.
OH, THAT'S GREAT!

03:39.306 --> 03:40.785
OOH!

03:40.959 --> 03:42.744
HELLO, LITTLE MISSY.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.136
I LIKE YOUR
HAIR LIKE THAT.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.835
I WEAR MY HAIR LIKE
THAT, TOO, SOMETIMES.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.230
AW, THIS IS NICE.

03:50.404 --> 03:53.102
Man: OH, THEY'RE SO
CUTE, AREN'T THEY?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.582
'COURSE, YOU'LL
NEVER HAVE ONE
OF YOUR OWN,

03:54.756 --> 03:56.236
UNLESS FOLLOW
THROUGH WITH A DATE.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.021
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK HERE?

03:59.195 --> 04:00.675
JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE YOU OUT.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.242
WHICH I THOUGHT
I ALREADY HAD.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.200
MM-HMM.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.596
OK, GET UP!
GET UP!

04:08.770 --> 04:11.816
HEY, HEY! OK.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.253
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DON'T
START TAKING THIS

04:13.427 --> 04:14.471
MORE SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE
GONNA BE SITTING HERE

04:14.645 --> 04:15.559
ALONE AGAIN NEXT
YEAR FOR CAREER DAY.

04:15.733 --> 04:16.995
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:17.169 --> 04:18.780
I DON'T WANNA DEAL WITH
THIS RIGHT NOW, OK?

04:18.954 --> 04:20.042
NO, IT'S NOT OK,

04:20.216 --> 04:21.478
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.045
YOU KNOW, I WORKED
MY TAIL OFF

04:23.219 --> 04:24.438
TO FIND YOU
A PERFECTLY GOOD
MATCH IN MICHAEL.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.874
AND WHAT DO
I GET FOR IT?

04:26.048 --> 04:27.397
YOU GO OUT
WITH HIM A GRAND
TOTAL OF ONCE.

04:27.571 --> 04:28.746
SO?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.226
SO? I'VE GOT
A REPUTATION
TO PROTECT.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.706
I'VE NEVER MISSED.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.751
WELL, THERE'S
A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

04:33.925 --> 04:34.970
[CHUCKLES]
NO, NO, NO.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.101
NOT WHEN IT COMES
TO FINDING LOVE.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.277
NOT WHEN
IT COMES TO ME.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.235
YOU ARE SO COCKY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

04:39.409 --> 04:40.976
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I AM.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.978
I KNOW YOU, PHOEBE.
INSIDE AND OUT.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.936
I HAVE RESEARCHED
EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.287
OK, THAT MAKES ME
FEEL VIOLATED.

04:47.461 --> 04:51.508
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
IN A MAN, BELIEVE ME.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.293
I AM AN EXPERT IN YOU.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.382
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHY I KNOW

04:55.556 --> 04:57.340
THERE'S NOTHING
ABSOLUTELY WRONG
WITH MICHAEL.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.647
OK! SO, I'M
JUST SUPPOSED
TO MARRY THE GUY?

04:59.821 --> 05:02.127
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I DIDN'T SAY
HE WAS THE ONE.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.999
THE POINT IS--

05:04.173 --> 05:05.827
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOUR POINT IS...

05:06.001 --> 05:06.958
RIGHT NOW.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.526
OK? I AM DEALING
WITH A LOT,

05:09.700 --> 05:11.833
AND I'M TRYING
TO BALANCE
EVERYTHING OUT.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.009
PHOEBE, LOVE
IS PARAMOUNT.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.664
NOT NOW, OK?
PLEASE, NOT NOW.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.495
YOU KNOW? MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TRY
REACHING OUT TO BILLIE.

05:21.669 --> 05:22.539
TALK TO HER.

05:25.542 --> 05:26.891
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

05:28.502 --> 05:30.330
I TOLD YOU...

05:30.504 --> 05:31.766
I KNOW YOU.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.820
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:42.994 --> 05:44.866
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE
THIS WHOLE STUPID THING
OUT, YOU KNOW?

05:45.040 --> 05:45.823
IF THIS REALLY
IS DESTINED--

05:45.997 --> 05:47.303
IT IS.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.826
WELL, THEN
IT SHOULD BE
WRITTEN SOMEWHERE,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.046
DON'T YOU THINK?
EVERYTHING ELSE IS.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.700
BILLIE, WHY DO YOU
KEEP FIGHTING THIS?

05:52.874 --> 05:57.574
BECAUSE. BECAUSE
I DON'T LIKE IT,
OK? IT SUCKS.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.490
I JUST--I FEEL
LIKE I WALKED OUT
ON MY FAMILY.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.145
I KNOW, BUT THEY'RE NOT
YOUR FAMILY, BILLIE,
THEY NEVER WERE.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.756
THEY USED YOU.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.106
I JUST DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.587
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BELIEVE THAT,

06:10.761 --> 06:12.546
AND I DON'T
BLAME YOU.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.286
I MEAN, AFTER
YOU TRUSTED THEM,

06:14.461 --> 06:17.333
AND YOU BEFRIENDED
THEM, YOU WERE BETRAYED.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.727
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THIS IS A HUGE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.642
IF WE CAN JUST TALK
TO THEM, MAYBE--

06:21.816 --> 06:24.209
WE TRIED TALKING TO
THEM, BUT THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT US OR YOU.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.950
THEY ONLY CARED
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.430
THAT'S ALL THEY
EVER CARED ABOUT.

06:27.604 --> 06:28.475
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.606
ISN'T IT?

06:29.780 --> 06:31.216
WHAT DID THEY
WANNA DO TO YOU

06:31.391 --> 06:32.653
WHEN THEY
FIRST MET YOU?

06:32.827 --> 06:34.742
THEY WANTED TO TRAIN YOU,

06:34.916 --> 06:35.873
TO TEACH YOU THE CRAFT.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.614
YES, AND THEY DID.

06:37.788 --> 06:40.269
YEAH, BUT NOT FOR YOU,
IT WAS FOR THEM.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.402
SO THEY COULD
KICK BACK AND DO
WHAT THEY WANTED

06:42.576 --> 06:46.057
AND YOU COULD GO OUT
THERE AND RISK YOUR
LIFE AND DO THEIR JOB.

06:46.231 --> 06:49.060
I MEAN, THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE CHARMED ONES,
BILLIE, NOT YOU.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.540
THEY'RE GOOD
PEOPLE, CHRISTY.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.237
THEY'VE HELPED
HUNDREDS OF
INNOCENTS.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.152
NOT LATELY,
THEY HAVEN'T.

06:54.326 --> 06:57.068
LATELY, THEY'VE BEEN
DOING EVERYTHING
FOR THEMSELVES,

06:57.242 --> 06:58.722
FOR THEIR OWN
PERSONAL GAIN.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.332
AND IT'S NOT RIGHT.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.160
I MEAN, THEY FAKED
THEIR DEATHS.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.466
THEY BARTERED
WITH DESTINY,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.947
THEY'VE REMADE
THE WORLD WITH AVATARS

07:06.121 --> 07:07.949
ALL FOR THEMSELVES.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.081
I MEAN, DOES THAT
SOUND LIKE THE GREATER
GOOD TO YOU?

07:10.255 --> 07:11.953
YOU KNOW, YOU
TALK ABOUT THEM
LIKE THEY'RE

07:12.127 --> 07:13.694
EVIL OR SOMETHING.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.392
BILLIE, IT'S NOT
ABOUT GOOD OR EVIL,
IT'S ABOUT POWER.

07:16.566 --> 07:20.178
AND ABSOLUTE
POWER CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.616
I MEAN, THEY FEEL LIKE
THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE
BY THE RULES ANYMORE.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.705
THAT THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT,

07:24.879 --> 07:26.794
AND NO ONE IS GONNA
BE THERE TO STOP THEM.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.405
YEAH, WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
HMM? STOP THEM?

07:29.579 --> 07:30.624
NO.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.277
NO, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO STOP THEM.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.670
IT OUR DESTINY.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.760
I'M JUST NOT
READY TO DO THAT.
I CAN'T.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.241
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
GET READY. WE BOTH DO.

07:39.415 --> 07:43.158
IF WE DON'T STOP
THEM...NOBODY WILL.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.507
IT'S UP TO US.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.126
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.346
NOTHING, I JUST--
YOU KNOW, I NEED
TO CLEAR MY HEAD

07:57.520 --> 08:01.176
AND GET OUT OF HERE
FOR A WHILE. SO...
I'LL BE BACK.

08:09.837 --> 08:10.968
[DING]

08:11.142 --> 08:13.710
OVERPOWERED
BY THE POWERLESS.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.625
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:15.799 --> 08:17.627
SHE WAS SAVED BY A
WHITELIGHTER, SALEK.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.151
THEN YOU SHOULD'VE
SHOT BOTH OF THEM.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.110
SHE WASN'T JUST A
WHITELIGHTER, SALEK.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.764
SHE WAS A CHARMED ONE.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.679
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

08:25.853 --> 08:27.245
YOU'VE TAUGHT
US WELL.

08:27.419 --> 08:30.684
NOT WELL ENOUGH,
APPARENTLY.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.165
AND WHERE IS SHE
NOW, THE CHARGE?

08:34.339 --> 08:35.732
I DON'T KNOW.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.604
THE WITCH CLOAKED
HER WITH HER MAGIC.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.040
SHOULD I MOVE ON
TO ANOTHER CHARGE?

08:39.214 --> 08:40.737
NO, I WANT
THIS ONE.

08:40.911 --> 08:43.131
TO LURE OUT
THE CHARMED ONE.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.832
THERE IS
NO BETTER PRIZE.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.094
BUT, I'M NOT
SURE HOW TO --

08:50.268 --> 08:53.097
YOU WON'T HAVE TO,
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.229
[SIGHS] I'VE WAITED
MY WHOLE LIFE

08:54.403 --> 08:55.491
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
LIKE THIS.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.841
BUT I MUST
BE PATIENT.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.061
I MUST WAIT FOR JUST
THE RIGHT OPENING.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.671
BUT IN SUCCESS,

09:01.845 --> 09:03.107
THE UNDERWORLD
WILL BOW TO YOU.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.718
THE DEMONS
WON'T STAND IT--

09:04.892 --> 09:07.590
I DON'T GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT WHAT
THE DEMONS THINK!

09:07.764 --> 09:10.419
LET THEM CLING TO
THEIR PROPHECIES

09:10.593 --> 09:11.551
ABOUT ULTIMATE
POWERS,

09:11.725 --> 09:13.901
THEIR RUMORS OF
FINAL BATTLES.

09:14.075 --> 09:18.470
I ONLY CARE
ABOUT ONE BATTLE.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.734
OK, UM...

09:20.908 --> 09:22.474
STAY PUT,
I WILL BE RIGHT
BACK, OK?

09:22.649 --> 09:23.867
WAIT, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.217
I HAVE TO GO
CHECK ON MY
SISTER.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.741
WELL, YOU
JUST DID THAT.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.307
OH, SEE,
ACTUALLY, NO.
IT'S MY OTHER SISTER.

09:29.481 --> 09:30.831
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
REALLY FREAKED OUT
RIGHT NOW,

09:31.005 --> 09:32.354
BUT I'VE GOT
SO MANY THINGS
GOING ON,

09:32.528 --> 09:33.573
SO IF YOU COULD
JUST WAIT HERE
FOR A SECOND--

09:33.747 --> 09:34.965
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

09:35.139 --> 09:36.271
I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING

09:36.445 --> 09:37.577
THAT'S GOING ON
HERE. I MEAN,
OK--

09:37.751 --> 09:39.100
WITCHES AND
BLACKLIGHTERS?

09:39.274 --> 09:40.536
OH, NO, NO, NO.
DARK-LIGHTERS.

09:40.710 --> 09:41.755
BUT WHAT
DOES IT MEAN?

09:41.929 --> 09:43.408
WHAT DOES IT
HAVE TO DO
WITH ME?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.802
YOU SEE, I TOLD YOU.
YOU ARE A FUTURE
WHITELIGHTER.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.761
