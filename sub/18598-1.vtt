05:38.364 --> 05:39.949
Clint, look out!

05:48.958 --> 05:52.044
Oh! Now you did it.

06:19.906 --> 06:21.240
Oh, am I glad you're not hurt.

06:21.449 --> 06:25.119
Those canoes aren't very stable.
It was just one of those things!

06:29.081 --> 06:30.833
Just one of those things, Mac.

06:38.549 --> 06:40.384
I admit it, it was stupid.

06:40.593 --> 06:43.387
We were out testing this baby,

06:43.596 --> 06:47.308
and I thought we'd sneak up on you
and make a few waves.

06:47.517 --> 06:50.478
- I guess I blew it, huh?
- The sound you hear

06:50.686 --> 06:52.647
is the wind rushing
through my brother's head.

06:54.607 --> 06:57.652
Look, all I can say is I'm sorry.

06:57.860 --> 07:01.155
Just let me have a list
of all your stuff, and I'll replace it.

07:01.364 --> 07:02.907
You got any diving gear?

07:03.115 --> 07:06.661
You can't dive here.
The bottom drops off.

07:06.869 --> 07:09.664
And besides that, the mud is so thick,
you couldn't see two feet.

07:09.872 --> 07:11.707
Believe me,
I've been down there.

07:11.916 --> 07:14.335
We're both really sorry, really.

07:14.544 --> 07:17.964
My name is Clint Crockett,
if you wanna know.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.674
I'm Karen.

07:19.882 --> 07:21.384
Smith.

07:21.592 --> 07:23.010
What, just Smith?

07:23.219 --> 07:25.680
Pickett Smith.

07:25.888 --> 07:26.931
Hello.

07:32.311 --> 07:33.896
It is a canoe.

07:34.105 --> 07:37.108
And there is
a stranger with them.

07:37.316 --> 07:40.778
Damn it, Stuart, get down there
and find out what the devil's going on.

07:40.987 --> 07:42.363
Jason, they'll be up here
in two minutes.

07:42.572 --> 07:44.991
If it's too much
of an an inconvenience for you...

07:50.830 --> 07:54.333
Ah, there's the pirate camp.

08:13.728 --> 08:16.606
How are you at badminton?

08:16.814 --> 08:18.649
How about tennis?

08:18.858 --> 08:20.651
I play-

08:20.860 --> 08:23.070
Clint loves to play games
he's sure to win.

08:23.279 --> 08:25.114
- How are you at Ping-Pong?
- Lousy.

08:25.323 --> 08:26.866
Hey, look, I just wanna
dry out a little bit.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.618
- Then I'll be on my way.
- You'd better forget it, pal.

08:28.826 --> 08:30.494
You're fresh blood
for our fun and games.

08:30.703 --> 08:34.081
Now, how would you like to partake
in a nice friendly wage?

08:34.289 --> 08:36.542
At least we owe you a drink or two
and some lunch.

08:36.751 --> 08:39.086
- Really, I don't wanna intrude.
- Intrude?

08:39.294 --> 08:42.548
No, tonight's very family,
very traditional,

08:42.756 --> 08:44.634
but this afternoon
is practically a picnic.

08:44.842 --> 08:47.178
We'd love to have you.

08:47.386 --> 08:49.263
How about it, buddy?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.100
All right.

09:52.326 --> 09:54.537
Mr. Smith, this is my uncle,
Stuart Martindale.

09:54.745 --> 09:56.065
- Pickett Smith.
- Mr. Martindale.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.290
How do you do?
What happened?

09:58.499 --> 10:00.626
Well, I was testing
the new engine,

10:00.835 --> 10:03.504
ran into Smith's canoe,
and I swamped him.

10:03.713 --> 10:06.215
Seems the canoe swamped you.

10:06.424 --> 10:07.758
Something like that.

10:07.967 --> 10:11.095
Mr. Smith accepted our offer
to stay for lunch.

10:11.303 --> 10:13.556
Delightful.
I'll tell Maybelle.

10:13.764 --> 10:15.933
You tell Jason.

10:16.142 --> 10:18.310
As soon as Grandpa
gets a look at you,

10:18.519 --> 10:20.646
Karen will show you to my room.

10:20.855 --> 10:22.255
You will do that, won't you, Karen?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.775
- I will.
- We'll get you some dry clothes.

10:24.984 --> 10:25.985
See you then.

10:56.640 --> 10:57.683
Clint, where you going?

10:57.892 --> 10:59.310
Gotta change clothes, Grandpa.

10:59.518 --> 11:00.853
Karen, what's going on?

11:01.062 --> 11:03.939
Grandpa, this is Pickett Smith.
Mr. Smith, Jason Crockett.

11:04.148 --> 11:06.525
- Hello, Mr. Crockett.
- My cousin, Michael Martindale.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.736
- Hi.
- Well, Karen?

11:08.944 --> 11:11.197
Grandpa, Clint didn't know
what he was doing out there,

11:11.405 --> 11:14.283
and we nearly ran Mr. Smith down,
so we fished him out.

11:14.492 --> 11:16.494
Now we're gonna offer him
a little food and drink.

11:16.702 --> 11:18.746
After he gets changed
out of his wet clothes.

11:18.954 --> 11:20.289
Just a moment.

11:20.498 --> 11:24.960
Mr. Smith, I saw you out on the lake
early this morning.

11:25.169 --> 11:28.339
You've been paddling around this island
for hours taking pictures.

11:28.547 --> 11:29.965
Yes, sir.

11:30.174 --> 11:31.425
Don't you know that's against the law?

11:31.634 --> 11:33.302
- Oh, Grandpa.
- No, sir, I didn't.

11:33.511 --> 11:36.722
There's a sign out there
that says private property.

11:36.931 --> 11:39.141
Who you with anyway?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.227
I'm a freelance photographer.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.230
I'm doing a pollution layout
for an ecology magazine.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.232
Take any pictures
of frogs lately?

11:46.440 --> 11:49.318
I saw the biggest bullfrog
this morning, this big.

11:49.527 --> 11:52.947
Damn creatures are everywhere.
Croak all night.

11:53.155 --> 11:56.158
Well, you know I sent Grover out
to take care of that.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.078
Mr. Smith,
did you happen to see a man

11:59.286 --> 12:02.123
spraying in that
small bay on the north shore?

12:02.331 --> 12:04.531
Later. This man has gotta change
out of his wet clothes.

12:06.252 --> 12:08.671
- Grover's not back yet?
- He'll be back, Karen.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.765
I'd like to call my editor.
Can I use your phone?

12:19.974 --> 12:22.852
Oh, sure, right there,
and when you're finished,

12:23.060 --> 12:24.820
I'll introduce you
to the rest of the family.

12:26.355 --> 12:28.065
It's dead.

12:28.274 --> 12:30.693
Oh, you'll get a dial tone.
We're on a regular line.

12:32.570 --> 12:33.571
It's dead.

12:35.114 --> 12:37.658
It's probably just the holiday.
It'll come back on soon.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.660
Oh, Karen, look.
Look what the kids did.

12:39.869 --> 12:41.203
- Cute, huh?
- It's adorable.

12:41.412 --> 12:45.541
Jenny, uh, this is Mr. Pickett Smith.
This is Clint's wife, Jenny.

12:45.749 --> 12:46.876
Hi, Jenny.

12:47.084 --> 12:49.044
Hello.
Well, where's Clint?

12:49.253 --> 12:51.463
He's upstairs
changing his wet clothes.

12:51.672 --> 12:52.923
What happened?

12:53.132 --> 12:56.010
It's a long story.

12:56.218 --> 12:59.263
Yeah, it usually is.

12:59.471 --> 13:01.223
Come on.
I'll introduce you to the rest.

13:03.475 --> 13:07.188
Okay, you all, time out.
A quick hello to Pickett Smith.

13:07.396 --> 13:08.647
This is my aunt Iris.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.149
- How do you do?
- How are you?

13:10.357 --> 13:14.153
And my cousin Kenneth Martindale.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.406
And Miss Bella Berenson.
Pickett Smith.

13:17.615 --> 13:19.909
- Hi.
- Welcome to Crockettland.

13:20.117 --> 13:22.828
Hi. I'm not quite awake yet,
Mr. Pickett.

13:23.037 --> 13:25.372
But I can hardly wait to see
what you look like.

13:27.708 --> 13:30.920
Well, now you can take that shower
that you were promised.

13:31.128 --> 13:33.047
Uh, Clint and Jenny's bedroom

13:33.255 --> 13:35.382
is the second door
on the right upstairs, okay?

13:35.591 --> 13:36.717
Okay.

13:36.926 --> 13:39.845
Kenneth, where do you
suppose he came from?

13:40.054 --> 13:42.765
Mom, your guess
is as good as mine.

13:46.018 --> 13:48.562
There. Finished.

13:48.771 --> 13:50.648
Do you think Daddy will like it?

13:50.856 --> 13:52.650
The monarch I just caught?

13:52.858 --> 13:55.527
I think it's the largest specimen
ever found in this state.

13:55.736 --> 13:57.905
And the other one I got
at the Vermont farm.

13:58.113 --> 14:00.324
Butterflies are really in,
Mrs. Martindale.

14:00.532 --> 14:04.078
Oh, I'm so glad I'm in, Bella.
Now, where's that metallic paper?

14:04.286 --> 14:06.330
I must get this wrapped
before lunch.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.836
Didn't I tell you that a weekend here
would be something else?

14:13.045 --> 14:15.381
Do you find it a little weird

14:15.589 --> 14:17.716
for a middle-aged lady
to chase butterflies?

14:20.094 --> 14:23.931
Honey, if that's her thing,
I do believe she's entitled.

14:24.139 --> 14:27.935
Me, myself, I just never had the energy
to run after anything.

14:35.901 --> 14:37.319
Perfect timing, pal.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.655
Caught you looking
at my jersey, didn't I?

14:39.863 --> 14:41.615
Looks like you were
quite a jock.

14:41.824 --> 14:45.244
Well... it was my wife's idea.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.705
You see, she's still impressed
with me ever since

14:47.913 --> 14:49.415
I was the school's highest scorer.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.792
Oh! Yeah?

14:52.001 --> 14:54.712
I don't think I've ever heard
of Mid-West Valley Central.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.463
Not everybody has.

14:56.672 --> 15:00.092
But I hope my two go there.
You'll meet them later.

15:00.301 --> 15:03.053
That picture, that's Jenny
when she was a cheerleader.

15:03.262 --> 15:04.430
Pretty girl.

15:04.638 --> 15:08.892
Yeah, I'd say she was, too.
Always was.

15:18.944 --> 15:22.239
Recognize old Clint? Huh?

15:22.448 --> 15:24.825
I'm the same weight now
I was when I was playing.

15:25.034 --> 15:27.161
Not one extra pound.

15:27.369 --> 15:29.163
It's really funny.

15:31.582 --> 15:35.044
Jenny, she's got a few more extra
little tiny bags under her eyes.

15:35.252 --> 15:37.046
That's about all.

15:37.254 --> 15:40.341
Come on, why don't we help ourselves
to some dry clothes?

15:40.549 --> 15:43.010
I think it'll make us
both feel pretty good, huh?

15:53.896 --> 15:56.023
Do it, girl. Do it.

15:56.231 --> 15:58.275
Yeah!

15:58.484 --> 16:01.570
Pretty, pretty, pretty!

16:03.947 --> 16:05.783
- Ah-ha.
- Mr. Kenneth, I have a message

16:05.991 --> 16:06.950
from your grandfather.

16:07.159 --> 16:09.453
With or without the profanity,
Charles?

16:09.661 --> 16:13.248
I was told to quote him exactly.
"Has your damn watch stopped?"

16:13.457 --> 16:15.918
Message received, Charles.

16:18.504 --> 16:21.715
Has your agency ever thought
of packaging your grandfather

16:21.924 --> 16:23.008
and giving him a new image?

16:23.217 --> 16:25.761
He knows he's not popular
with the public or his family,

16:25.969 --> 16:26.970
and he revels in it.

16:27.179 --> 16:28.419
Well, he treats me nice enough.

16:28.430 --> 16:31.058
He wouldn't dare admit
that we've shaken him up.

16:31.266 --> 16:34.478
Nobody ever invites guests
for Fourth of July, and I bring you.

16:34.686 --> 16:37.898
A girl. Worse.
A sexy model.

16:39.483 --> 16:41.026
And that ain't all either.

16:41.235 --> 16:44.905
But would Jason ever
admit we shook him up? Never.

16:58.127 --> 17:01.422
Well, it looks like
most of the family have joined us.

17:01.630 --> 17:06.260
Clint, any reason why your children
should be 12 minutes late?

17:06.468 --> 17:08.178
Where are they, Jenny?

17:08.387 --> 17:10.222
Grandfather, you know
how difficult it is

17:10.431 --> 17:12.141
to get those kids away
from the pool.

17:12.348 --> 17:14.435
And on a day like this?

17:14.643 --> 17:16.436
Well, I told them.

17:16.645 --> 17:19.647
I told those kids 20 minutes ago
to get out of their wet suits

17:19.857 --> 17:20.898
and change for lunch.

17:21.108 --> 17:25.194
Jenny, far be it from me to tell you
how to raise your children,

17:25.404 --> 17:27.448
but if you forbid them
the use of the pool

17:27.656 --> 17:30.826
until they've learned the rules
of being at meals on time--

17:31.034 --> 17:32.911
Well, it's not my fault.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.247
I'll make sure
they understand that, sir.

17:35.456 --> 17:38.083
Hey, everybody, look!
Look! Look what I found!

17:38.292 --> 17:41.128
Look what I found.
He's gigantic.

17:41.336 --> 17:43.255
Don't be so stupid, Jay.

17:43.464 --> 17:45.883
Don't, Mike! That's mine!

17:46.091 --> 17:48.844
Now, listen, Jay, Tina,
you're both late.

17:49.052 --> 17:50.679
Now go sit down
and eat your food.

17:50.888 --> 17:53.891
Jay, you were right.
He was gigantic.

17:54.099 --> 17:56.935
Oh, I hate those things,
and that make so much noise.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.770
Just making everybody crazy.

17:58.979 --> 18:01.899
Oh, nonsense, Jenny.

18:02.107 --> 18:05.110
You see many frogs along
the shore, Mr. Smith?

18:05.319 --> 18:06.361
Yes, sir, a few.

18:06.570 --> 18:08.363
More than you consider usual?

18:08.572 --> 18:11.492
I guess so, but sometimes
they have a summer like this.

18:11.700 --> 18:15.120
Animals overpopulate.
They'll die off by next year.

18:15.329 --> 18:19.041
You sound like you might
be an ecology expert. Are you?

18:19.249 --> 18:21.502
Yes, sir, to an extent.

18:21.710 --> 18:24.004
Well, you see,
I have an impatient family.

18:24.213 --> 18:25.881
They can't wait till next year.

18:26.089 --> 18:28.967
How do they get rid
of the frogs now?

18:29.176 --> 18:32.888
Well, it seems like everyone
in our family is hung up on frogs.

18:33.096 --> 18:35.390
They really do keep us awake
every night--

18:35.599 --> 18:37.184
Those of us who don't consume

18:37.392 --> 18:39.811
a fifth of vodka every night,
that is.

18:41.396 --> 18:43.023
Which reminds me,

18:43.232 --> 18:45.275
how do we get rid of 'em?

18:45.484 --> 18:49.404
I have suggested pouring oil
in the water to choke them off.

18:49.613 --> 18:51.490
That would help,
wouldn't it, Mr. Smith?

18:51.698 --> 18:54.034
Yeah, but you'd be killing a lot
of other things at the same time.

18:54.243 --> 18:56.245
And make my home smell
like a refinery.

18:56.453 --> 18:58.163
Well, I can't sleep.

18:58.372 --> 19:00.040
It's not the end of the world, Jenny.

19:00.249 --> 19:02.167
Well, it seems so.

19:02.376 --> 19:06.004
With all our technology
and all my money,

19:06.213 --> 19:08.507
we still can't get rid
of these frogs.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.841
Interesting, isn't it?

19:10.050 --> 19:13.303
Yes, sir, it is.
But you'll think of something.

19:13.512 --> 19:16.890
Well, I suggest you do me a favor.

19:17.099 --> 19:18.892
Go take a good look round.

19:19.101 --> 19:20.686
Come back,
give me an honest report

19:20.894 --> 19:24.147
so I can quiet down
this nervous group.

19:24.356 --> 19:27.359
All right.
You have a deal.

19:27.568 --> 19:29.361
Good.

19:37.995 --> 19:39.955
These things feel a lot better.

19:40.163 --> 19:41.832
Thank Maybelle for drying
them for me, will you?

19:42.040 --> 19:43.834
I surely will,
and congratulations.

19:44.042 --> 19:46.211
You seem to have
impressed Grandpa.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.213
- That's good.
- You have a nice trip.

19:48.422 --> 19:50.382
Okay. I'll see you later.

19:50.591 --> 19:54.136
Mr. Smith,
may I see you a moment?

19:54.344 --> 19:56.263
That'll be all, Michael.

20:00.309 --> 20:01.935
I was just on my way out,
Mr. Crockett.

20:02.144 --> 20:03.424
Would you mind closing the door?

20:07.816 --> 20:10.527
Now, if I might ask a small favor.

20:10.736 --> 20:13.572
It's obvious you can't see
the whole island before dark.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.657
I don't think I have
to see the whole island.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.368
But if you would take
the north road,

20:18.577 --> 20:21.288
keep your eyes peeled
for my man Grover.

20:22.331 --> 20:25.208
He left about 6:00 this morning
to do some spraying

20:25.417 --> 20:27.127
up in that little bay up there

20:27.336 --> 20:29.713
where the mosquitoes
and the frogs are pretty bad.

20:29.921 --> 20:33.216
But it's my belief he's A.W.O.L.

20:33.425 --> 20:36.720
with that little lady friend
from across the lake.

20:36.928 --> 20:39.890
If you do see him,
will you tell him I want him?

20:40.098 --> 20:41.141
Yes, sir, I'll be glad to.

20:41.350 --> 20:42.893
Wanna take one of these?

20:43.101 --> 20:45.354
Oh, no, sir.

20:45.562 --> 20:48.398
I don't think a stuffed bullfrog
would add a thing.

24:17.482 --> 24:18.817
Maybelle?

24:19.025 --> 24:20.193
Oh, I couldn't.
Not now.

24:20.402 --> 24:22.320
Oh, come on.
Live a little bit.

24:22.529 --> 24:26.241
Oh, well, why not?
But don't tell anybody.

24:26.449 --> 24:29.202
Hey, a toast to Crockettland.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.499
Mmm.

24:34.708 --> 24:38.837
You know, um...
my name's Maybelle, too.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.630
Kinda thought so.

24:44.217 --> 24:47.387
Born and raised
in Jackson, Mississippi.

24:49.848 --> 24:51.641
- Oh, Bella?
- Yes?

24:51.850 --> 24:54.603
There's always hot coffee
and a friendly conversation

24:54.811 --> 24:56.855
in the kitchen if you ever need it.

24:57.063 --> 25:00.275
Thanks, Maybelle, 'cause I think
I might be needing it.

25:28.428 --> 25:30.764
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.

25:30.972 --> 25:34.142
Oh, well, just kind of relax,
and you'll get it after a while.

25:34.351 --> 25:37.020
That's an unusual dress, Bella.
Did you make it?

25:37.228 --> 25:39.564
No, I didn't make it.
I designed it.

25:39.773 --> 25:42.609
And I think it's fantastic.

25:42.817 --> 25:45.070
We are talking about the dress,
aren't we?

25:47.739 --> 25:51.701
That noise is driving me insane.
Won't they ever stop?

25:51.910 --> 25:54.162
Stop complaining, Jenny.
It'll stop soon.

25:54.371 --> 25:56.748
Daddy, what if Grover's
lying in a ditch somewhere?

25:56.957 --> 25:58.833
I hope he's not hurt.

25:59.042 --> 26:00.126
Serve him right if he is.

26:00.335 --> 26:02.754
Oh, Grandpa, that's awful.

26:02.963 --> 26:04.965
You make it sound like the worst
of the ugly rich.

26:05.173 --> 26:07.550
We are the ugly rich.

26:07.759 --> 26:09.552
Well, we're entitled
to be ugly, Karen.

26:09.761 --> 26:11.596
God knows
we pay enough taxes.

26:11.805 --> 26:13.890
Daddy, did you know
the government is forcing us

26:14.099 --> 26:16.393
to put strainers on our paper mills?

26:16.601 --> 26:20.563
It's called antipollution
control, Iris.

26:20.772 --> 26:22.857
Oh, what's the difference
what it's called?

26:23.066 --> 26:24.150
It costs millions,

26:24.359 --> 26:26.528
and our dividends
will be shot to hell.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.712
Where'd you find Grover's Jeep?

26:43.920 --> 26:46.506
- Far end of the island.
- And still no sign of Grover?

26:46.715 --> 26:49.968
- No.
- Hell, I'm not surprised.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.012
You can't depend
on help these days.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.848
Not unless they've been with you
from the very beginning.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.158
Is it still dead?

27:14.909 --> 27:15.952
Yeah.

27:16.161 --> 27:17.954
That dumb phone company.

27:18.163 --> 27:19.603
Can we buy you a drink
before dinner?

27:21.374 --> 27:22.792
No. No, thanks.

27:26.379 --> 27:29.799
- Can I see you alone a minute?
- All right.

27:30.008 --> 27:32.093
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.690
How much longer,
Maybelle?

27:45.899 --> 27:47.984
In a few moments.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.179
I did everything with him I could,

28:16.387 --> 28:18.807
but we gotta get
that body out of there.

28:19.015 --> 28:22.185
Yeah. Well, thanks
for telling me first.

28:22.393 --> 28:24.229
I appreciate it.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.981
No use frightening the others,
today of all days.

28:27.190 --> 28:30.819
Yeah, I gather tomorrow's
quite a celebration.

28:31.027 --> 28:34.739
This week with my family is the one
permanent thing left in my life.

28:34.948 --> 28:38.868
15 years ago,
nature threw me for a loss,

28:39.077 --> 28:41.663
dumped me in this chair.

28:41.871 --> 28:46.501
We have four birthdays in July--
Mine, Karen's,

28:46.709 --> 28:50.004
Stuart, and Michael.

28:50.213 --> 28:52.715
We've celebrated
together for years.

28:52.924 --> 28:56.302
We'll celebrate until I'm 100.

28:56.511 --> 28:58.304
Right here.

28:58.513 --> 29:02.684
Yes, sir, well, you have
my birthday eve congratulations.

29:02.892 --> 29:05.311
I'm sure it'll be
a great day for everyone.

29:08.064 --> 29:09.274
If I can't reach the village,

29:09.482 --> 29:12.026
I'll have Clint or someone
run me back across the lake.

29:12.235 --> 29:13.528
What do you mean?

29:13.736 --> 29:16.072
Stay here.
Stay here till morning.

29:17.866 --> 29:21.619
And what about the body?

29:31.379 --> 29:32.839
I don't believe it.

29:36.885 --> 29:38.469
Look at this.

29:52.901 --> 29:55.653
- Somebody kill it!
- Stand aside.

30:11.127 --> 30:13.838
Charles, take it out.

30:30.813 --> 30:33.733
Well, what's everybody
standing around for?

30:33.942 --> 30:35.109
Let's eat.

30:54.671 --> 30:57.340
Frogs attacking windows,

30:57.548 --> 30:59.676
snakes in chandeliers.

30:59.884 --> 31:02.428
Those aren't exactly
normal things, Mr. Crockett.

31:02.637 --> 31:05.139
I don't think
there's much to worry about.

31:05.348 --> 31:08.810
I'm sure I can get the state
to spray some pesticides.

31:09.018 --> 31:10.645
Yes, sir, I'm sure you can.

31:10.853 --> 31:12.897
You can kill a hell of a lot
of other things, too.

31:13.106 --> 31:16.943
Mr. Smith, that is where
you and I part company.

31:17.151 --> 31:20.738
I still believe
man is master of the world.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.198
Does that mean he can't live

31:22.407 --> 31:23.783
in harmony with the rest of it?

31:23.992 --> 31:27.870
You call that horrible racket
out there harmonious?

31:29.163 --> 31:32.792
Mr. Crockett, I know it sounds
strange as hell, but...

31:33.001 --> 31:34.794
what if nature
were trying to get back at us?

31:35.003 --> 31:36.963
Nonsense.

31:37.171 --> 31:38.381
Then how do you explain it?

31:40.174 --> 31:42.051
We just sit and wait.

31:52.645 --> 31:54.981
It seems like all I ever do
around here is baby-sit,

31:55.189 --> 31:57.149
hope they don't do something
that might annoy him,

31:57.233 --> 31:59.027
and they always do.

31:59.235 --> 32:02.363
The family--
Boy, they don't like me.

32:02.572 --> 32:03.906
And you.

32:04.115 --> 32:07.535
You're out drinking in that speedboat
all day and all night.

32:07.744 --> 32:08.911
Well, I hate it.

32:11.289 --> 32:13.708
It's only a couple
of weeks a year.

32:14.876 --> 32:17.920
It's "Yes, sir," and "No, sir,"
all day long.

32:18.129 --> 32:20.631
The only one
that matters is him.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.675
What about me?

32:24.385 --> 32:26.220
Shouldn't your wife come first?

32:37.648 --> 32:38.983
Now listen to me.

32:41.861 --> 32:43.196
I said listen to me.

32:48.076 --> 32:52.455
Now, that old man
is not gonna live forever.

32:52.663 --> 32:55.750
And that means a million dollars
or more to me.

32:58.795 --> 33:01.297
All we have to do is just play
our cards right.

33:01.506 --> 33:02.799
I don't think
that I can stand--

33:03.007 --> 33:04.050
Just shut your mouth!

33:10.306 --> 33:13.267
- Pickett?
- Hi.

33:13.476 --> 33:15.937
- You all right?
- Sure.

33:17.105 --> 33:18.385
Just looking around
a little bit.

33:21.234 --> 33:24.695
I'm getting like Jenny.
The frogs are driving me crazy, too.

33:32.245 --> 33:36.124
It's like a different world
out here at night.

33:36.332 --> 33:39.085
This place must seem like
a different place to you day or night.

33:41.838 --> 33:43.297
How long you been doing this?

33:43.506 --> 33:45.716
- What?
- Taking pictures.

33:47.427 --> 33:49.429
Only real job I ever had.

33:49.637 --> 33:51.305
Do you always work outdoors?

33:53.141 --> 33:55.518
Whenever I can.

33:55.726 --> 33:57.145
You must really like it.

33:58.729 --> 34:01.065
- Yeah, I like it.
- Why?

34:02.400 --> 34:06.612
Well, it lets me travel a lot...

34:06.821 --> 34:10.533
see a lot of country,
meet some good people.

34:11.826 --> 34:15.538
I'm on my own time.
Nobody on my back.

34:17.581 --> 34:19.375
Freedom, I guess.

34:21.043 --> 34:23.963
What were you and Grandpa
talking about tonight?

34:24.172 --> 34:26.090
Nothing. Just talking.

34:26.299 --> 34:27.925
Did you have to close the door?

34:29.260 --> 34:30.780
When you came back
in the Jeep tonight,

34:30.803 --> 34:33.389
I knew something had happened.
Now, what was it?

34:33.598 --> 34:35.933
Come on, Pickett.
Tell me.

34:37.018 --> 34:38.186
What is going on here

34:38.393 --> 34:41.147
that Grandpa doesn't think
his own family is entitled to know?

34:41.355 --> 34:43.940
I just don't know what it is.

34:48.279 --> 34:50.114
All right.

34:51.866 --> 34:53.743
It's getting damp out here.
I'm going inside.

34:53.951 --> 34:55.161
Wanna come?

34:55.369 --> 34:58.414
No, you go ahead.
I'll see you in the morning.

34:58.623 --> 35:00.458
All right.

35:03.252 --> 35:04.962
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:40.540 --> 35:43.042
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.
- Happy Fourth of July, Grandpa.

35:43.251 --> 35:46.504
I thank you, children.
Getting all ready for the excitement?

35:46.712 --> 35:48.232
When do we get to do
the Roman candles?

35:48.339 --> 35:50.466
- And sparklers?
- When it's time. When it's dark.

35:50.675 --> 35:52.468
After the birthday cake
and everything.

35:52.677 --> 35:54.929
You're old enough
to know that by now.

35:55.137 --> 35:56.847
Don't just stand there.
Go off and play somewhere.

35:57.056 --> 35:59.267
- Okay.
- Another year gone by, Mr. Crockett.

35:59.475 --> 36:01.811
Another happy day for everybody.

36:02.019 --> 36:04.814
Yeah.
Thank you, Maybelle.

36:05.022 --> 36:07.984
Another year ended,
another year beginning.

36:08.192 --> 36:09.902
Charles seeing
to the decorations?

36:10.111 --> 36:11.320
Oh, yes, sir.

36:13.531 --> 36:15.908
Anybody seen Clint?

36:16.117 --> 36:19.203
God forbid I should come
before his training program.

36:19.412 --> 36:22.456
Not quite like it was
in college, huh?

36:22.665 --> 36:25.042
That's just the trouble,
Grandfather.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.795
It's just like it was in college.

36:30.381 --> 36:32.883
Jenny, perhaps you'd like to help
with the decorations.

36:33.092 --> 36:34.927
If you've got the time.

36:37.096 --> 36:39.974
Thank you. I'd love to.

37:00.870 --> 37:04.957
Uh-oh. Something tells me
it's the Fourth of July.

37:05.166 --> 37:07.251
Or the Martians have landed.

37:07.460 --> 37:09.879
Well, at least
they didn't start before 8:00.

37:10.087 --> 37:12.548
Obviously, some of the family
haven't heard them yet.

37:12.757 --> 37:14.342
Did you rest well, Mr. Smith?

37:14.550 --> 37:15.926
Yes, I did. Thank you.

37:16.135 --> 37:18.262
- Is there anything you need?
- Nothing.

37:18.471 --> 37:21.098
Well, I'm going to mend my net.
I'll see you all later.

37:24.352 --> 37:27.104
Welcome to another day
in the life of the Crocketts.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.649
- Want some more coffee?
- No, thanks.

37:29.857 --> 37:31.901
Luau

37:32.109 --> 37:34.570
nearly came by your room
last night.

37:34.779 --> 37:36.656
Why didn't you?

37:38.574 --> 37:40.034
The floorboards creak too much.

37:40.242 --> 37:43.371
I'm sorry Jason Crockett
doesn't keep his floorboards

37:43.579 --> 37:44.664
in better condition.

37:46.874 --> 37:48.584
I liked talking to you last night.

37:48.793 --> 37:50.002
We'll have to do more of it.

38:09.105 --> 38:13.275
All right, I'm ready to play
"King of the Log."

38:19.240 --> 38:20.408
Hey, Smith!

38:20.616 --> 38:22.201
He's not here.

38:22.410 --> 38:24.245
Where is he?

38:26.455 --> 38:28.999
Michael, when you're through pounding,

38:29.208 --> 38:30.960
why don't you warm me up a little bit?

38:33.587 --> 38:37.049
No. No, I don't want to.

38:37.258 --> 38:38.592
Aw, come on!

38:40.845 --> 38:42.680
Come on.

38:45.516 --> 38:48.144
Just don't hurt me.

38:49.603 --> 38:52.940
The idea is to just
step on that log...

38:53.149 --> 38:55.317
and stay on it.

38:55.526 --> 38:57.987
Put your left hand
behind your back like that,

38:58.195 --> 39:00.030
and that's all your have to do.

39:03.325 --> 39:05.494
Just like that.

39:05.703 --> 39:06.871
Come on, Michael.
Get him.

39:07.079 --> 39:08.873
I've had enough!

39:10.833 --> 39:12.418
The boy's a loser.

39:15.713 --> 39:18.215
Your boyfriend get lost?

39:18.424 --> 39:19.925
I wish I could be so lucky.

39:25.765 --> 39:27.808
How would you like
to fight me for my log?

39:28.017 --> 39:31.103
That's really not my kind of game.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.274
What is your kind of game?

39:35.483 --> 39:36.901
I don't think you'd dig it.

39:37.109 --> 39:39.945
It's a little slower than that
and, uh...

39:40.154 --> 39:41.447
sophisticated.

39:42.865 --> 39:44.158
Try me.

39:44.366 --> 39:46.744
I'm not gonna be here that long.

39:56.295 --> 39:58.297
Morning, Mr. Crockett.
Happy birthday.

39:58.506 --> 40:00.800
Oh, thank you.
Had your breakfast?

40:01.008 --> 40:02.134
Yes, sir. Thank you.

40:02.343 --> 40:05.554
Hey, Smith,
how about some games?

40:05.763 --> 40:08.057
Later, Clint.
I wanna talk to him.

40:08.265 --> 40:09.975
Yes, sir.

40:10.184 --> 40:11.852
I thought maybe I'd look around
your island a little more,

40:12.061 --> 40:13.646
Mr. Crockett, if you don't mind.

40:13.854 --> 40:15.439
I'll check out
the phone line for you.

40:16.982 --> 40:20.110
Michael,
why don't you take the Jeep,

40:20.319 --> 40:23.030
go and see if you can find
a line down somewhere?

40:23.239 --> 40:25.407
Certainly, Grandpa.

40:29.161 --> 40:33.499
Mr. Smith, seems to me
you got something on your mind.

40:36.126 --> 40:37.837
Care to tell me about it?

40:38.045 --> 40:41.131
Sir, I don't wanna
spoil your day here,

40:41.340 --> 40:43.425
but something's gotta be done
with that body.

40:43.634 --> 40:46.428
I'll tell you something else,
Mr. Crockett.

40:46.637 --> 40:48.797
You overdone it with those pesticides
and poisons here.

40:48.931 --> 40:50.683
I'm afraid to think
what's happened.

41:08.993 --> 41:12.079
There you are, Mr. Michael.
Just in case.

41:12.288 --> 41:13.372
Thanks, Maybelle.

46:48.123 --> 46:50.123
And this year I believe I've
thought of everything.

46:50.209 --> 46:53.795
A new badminton bird,
a new net, and four new rackets.

46:54.004 --> 46:55.964
Oh, and, Kenneth, would you go
into the greenhouse, dear,

46:56.173 --> 46:59.176
and get some cymbidiums
and some of those pale green orchids?

46:59.384 --> 47:01.511
You know, the little,
teeny, tiny ones?

47:01.720 --> 47:04.681
I just don't have time,
and Maybelle isn't quite up to it.

47:04.890 --> 47:08.936
Oh, a papilio glaucus.
I must get my net right away.

47:09.144 --> 47:11.313
It's the least I can do.

47:14.358 --> 47:15.692
Now, wait a minute.

47:15.901 --> 47:18.278
I wanna show you
my new beanbag punch.

47:18.487 --> 47:19.988
No way.

47:21.949 --> 47:23.408
Son, go get him.

47:23.617 --> 47:25.327
Hey, cut it out, Dad.

47:25.535 --> 47:27.246
Mix it up with him. Show him.

47:27.454 --> 47:28.705
I'd love to see him
on his ass.

47:28.914 --> 47:30.791
I don't wanna show anybody anything.

47:30.999 --> 47:33.319
If you're chicken, at least
you could find something useful

47:33.377 --> 47:34.586
to do with yourself.

47:36.672 --> 47:41.551
I suppose I could, um,
put up the targets for rifle practice.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.971
Or I could, uh, make sure

47:44.179 --> 47:45.859
that there are a proper number
of beanbags.

47:47.057 --> 47:49.851
I might even volunteer
to play gin with granddaddy.

47:50.060 --> 47:51.436
But you won't.

47:51.645 --> 47:53.355
No, I won't.

49:19.441 --> 49:21.276
Cymbidium.

49:21.485 --> 49:25.155
Cymbidium, cymbidium.

49:25.364 --> 49:27.366
Hmm.

49:27.574 --> 49:28.950
Cymbidium.

49:33.330 --> 49:36.041
Cymbidium, cymbidium.

49:49.471 --> 49:54.059
I hope you realize that was
your last meal on the Crocketts.

50:23.004 --> 50:26.591
Grandfather, I don't know
when you wanna start the games.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.718
Not everybody's back yet.

50:28.927 --> 50:31.721
But, uh, you usually
do start by now.

50:31.930 --> 50:34.349
Who's not back?
Michael and who else?

50:34.558 --> 50:37.686
Iris went off after a butterfly
about a half an hour ago.

50:37.894 --> 50:39.614
Kenneth said something
about the greenhouse,

50:39.729 --> 50:41.148
about choosing some flowers.

50:41.356 --> 50:43.150
Karen, go in the house
and see if he's there.

50:43.358 --> 50:45.152
If he is,
tell him to get out here.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.820
All right, Grandpa.

50:47.028 --> 50:49.114
Jason, I'm sure Iris won't
be very long.

50:49.322 --> 50:51.575
If you're so sure,
what are you standing there for?

50:51.783 --> 50:52.784
Go find her.

50:55.829 --> 50:57.664
- Okay. Yeah.
- Easy.

50:57.873 --> 51:00.041
Wait a minute.

51:00.250 --> 51:02.294
There's a lot of strategy
in this once you get the hang of it.

51:02.502 --> 51:04.754
Is that what
you call it down here?

51:04.963 --> 51:06.840
Yeah, that's what
we call it down here.

51:07.048 --> 51:08.008
That was nice.

51:14.639 --> 51:16.057
Charles,
have you seen Kenneth?

51:16.266 --> 51:18.466
He asked Maybelle
to get out some bowls for the flowers.

51:18.602 --> 51:21.062
- That was an hour ago.
- Well, that's peculiar.

51:21.271 --> 51:24.316
Grandpa's getting very impatient.

51:24.524 --> 51:26.276
- Have you seen Kenneth?
- No.

51:26.485 --> 51:27.444
What's the matter?
Is that still not working?

51:27.652 --> 51:28.612
Mm-hmm.

51:28.820 --> 51:30.030
What is going on here?

51:30.238 --> 51:31.865
I don't know.

51:33.617 --> 51:35.994
And your Grandpa
is getting pretty tough out there.

51:36.203 --> 51:37.871
I thought you were the one
supposed to be able to handle him

51:38.079 --> 51:39.164
when nobody else could.

51:39.372 --> 51:41.333
Yeah, and then comes
the point when nobody can.

51:41.541 --> 51:42.542
I'd better find Kenneth,

51:42.751 --> 51:44.311
or there's gonna be
some real fireworks.

51:56.890 --> 51:58.683
Hmm.

51:58.892 --> 52:00.227
Okay.

53:51.546 --> 53:54.424
Quiet, Colonel.

53:54.633 --> 53:57.052
What is it?
What does he see?

53:57.260 --> 54:02.015
What's going on?
Clint! Get me out of here.

54:02.223 --> 54:05.101
Clint, keep your wife quiet.

54:05.310 --> 54:07.070
Grandfather, something terrible
is happening.

54:07.187 --> 54:08.938
You be quiet!

54:10.482 --> 54:12.150
Mr. Crockett, we all know
how important

54:12.359 --> 54:13.318
your plans are to you--

54:13.526 --> 54:15.362
You couldn't possibly know.

54:15.570 --> 54:17.781
We're going ahead with this
celebration today

54:17.989 --> 54:19.699
just as I planned,

54:19.908 --> 54:21.743
just as I've celebrated
all my life,

54:21.951 --> 54:23.620
and nothing's going to stop it.

54:40.095 --> 54:41.596
Christ!

54:52.816 --> 54:55.318
- Kenneth, no!
- Bella, there's nothing you can do.

54:55.527 --> 54:57.278
No! No!

55:12.043 --> 55:15.380
He's dead! He's dead!
He's dead! He's dead!

55:15.588 --> 55:16.798
Who's dead?

55:17.006 --> 55:18.091
K-- K--

55:18.299 --> 55:20.343
Oh, my God. I knew it.

55:20.552 --> 55:22.345
You sure? How?

55:22.554 --> 55:24.305
He's dead all right, Mr. Crockett.

55:24.514 --> 55:26.850
There's bottles of poison
broken all over that greenhouse.

55:27.058 --> 55:28.226
He's been asphyxiated.

55:33.857 --> 55:36.234
Karen, take me inside.

55:41.114 --> 55:42.407
Clint, I'm gonna need your help.

55:53.918 --> 55:57.213
I'd be glad to do
anything I can, Mr. Smith.

55:57.422 --> 55:59.340
Thank you, Charles.

56:23.072 --> 56:25.200
- But why?
- Because I want you to

56:25.408 --> 56:26.743
and Grandpa Crockett
wants you to.

56:26.951 --> 56:29.162
But what's the matter?
Why is everybody acting so funny?

56:29.370 --> 56:31.122
Just get up
in your room and play.

56:37.754 --> 56:39.088
How do you figure...

56:39.297 --> 56:40.381
I don't know, Charles.

56:42.467 --> 56:45.094
- Is there a place we can put him?
- Yes, sir. I'll show you.

58:12.265 --> 58:13.308
Iris?

58:18.563 --> 58:20.356
Iris!

58:25.653 --> 58:26.946
Iris.

59:38.476 --> 59:40.061
Aah!

01:00:00.623 --> 01:00:01.958
Aah!

01:00:35.158 --> 01:00:36.826
Oh, no.

01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:09.942
Oh...

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.253
Iris!

01:03:27.496 --> 01:03:28.456
Aah!

01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:37.942
Thank you, Maybelle.

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:40.194
Grandpa,
I think that we've got to--

01:04:40.403 --> 01:04:43.155
We've just got to get out of here.

01:04:43.364 --> 01:04:45.700
What about Mike, Iris,
and Stuart?

01:04:45.908 --> 01:04:48.108
When we get help, then we can
find out what's happened--

01:04:48.202 --> 01:04:50.371
Now, listen to me,
all of you.

01:04:50.579 --> 01:04:53.582
I'm just as heartbroken
over this tragedy as any of you,

01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:56.711
but there's plenty of time later
to do what has to be done.

01:04:56.919 --> 01:04:58.713
Later?
Why wait, Grandpa?

01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:02.049
Because I won't let anything interfere
with today's schedule.

01:05:02.258 --> 01:05:04.260
Not anything.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.345
The year ends
and the year begins.

01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:08.389
It always has. It always will.

01:05:08.597 --> 01:05:10.891
Always?
What do you mean, "always"?

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.978
I'm not interested
in what you think.

01:05:14.186 --> 01:05:16.981
Pickett, you've got to help us.
We don't know what to do.

01:05:17.189 --> 01:05:20.318
Well, I know what to do,
and we're going to do it.

01:05:22.111 --> 01:05:25.781
Just because of one death,
an accident,

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.867
that's no reason
for everybody to panic.

01:05:28.075 --> 01:05:30.870
Two deaths, Mr. Crockett.
Two very strange deaths.

01:05:31.078 --> 01:05:33.331
- Who else?
- What did you see?

01:05:33.539 --> 01:05:36.625
Grover's dead.
Found him yesterday.

01:05:38.169 --> 01:05:42.965
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Because I thought it best not to.

01:05:43.174 --> 01:05:45.301
Didn't want to spoil your day.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:46.969
Whose day?

01:05:47.178 --> 01:05:48.929
What happened to him?

01:05:49.138 --> 01:05:51.974
He was in the swamp.
He'd been hit by a snake.

01:05:53.976 --> 01:05:57.229
Is that another accident, Grandpa?
Is that another coincidence?

01:05:57.438 --> 01:05:59.690
Karen, and everybody...

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:03.402
this conversation is ended.

01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:04.862
No, it isn't.

01:06:05.071 --> 01:06:07.365
Look, I don't know
what's going on around here,

01:06:07.573 --> 01:06:09.575
or if it's happening anywhere else,

01:06:09.784 --> 01:06:11.786
but we're a bunch of damn fools
if we don't face the fact

01:06:11.994 --> 01:06:13.594
that we're in a hell
of a lot of trouble,

01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:15.581
and we're gonna have to
get together and fight it.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:17.792
Keep on talking, Pickett,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.669
'cause you're the only man
around here who's saying anything.

01:06:20.878 --> 01:06:23.839
First of all, we're gonna have to try
to find Iris, Stuart, and Michael.

01:06:24.048 --> 01:06:27.051
I'll be very honest with you.
I don't think we will.

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:29.387
Not alive, anyway.

01:06:29.595 --> 01:06:32.515
But whether we find them or not,
we've got to get off this damn island.

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:34.100
All of us. Now!

01:06:34.308 --> 01:06:37.228
We'll take the powerboat.
If we have to, we'll tow the canoe.

01:06:37.436 --> 01:06:40.231
And leave this house empty?
Deserted?

01:06:40.439 --> 01:06:42.650
I don't think there's gonna be anyone
around to worry about today,

01:06:42.858 --> 01:06:44.068
or haven't you noticed?

01:06:44.276 --> 01:06:46.821
There hasn't been one boat
out on that lake all day.

01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:50.491
Do you think that's happening
everywhere, Mr. Smith?

01:06:50.699 --> 01:06:53.285
Well, if it is, we all better
get out of here together.

01:06:53.494 --> 01:06:55.830
Well, I forbid it!

01:06:56.038 --> 01:06:57.957
I control these people,
not you.

01:06:59.959 --> 01:07:02.795
Nobody controls me, Mr. Crockett.

01:07:03.003 --> 01:07:05.714
Now, I am asking
to get off this island,

01:07:05.923 --> 01:07:07.425
by myself or with somebody else.

01:07:07.633 --> 01:07:08.926
I just wanna go!

01:07:09.135 --> 01:07:11.554
You can leave
whenever you feel like it.

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:14.265
Mr. Crockett,
begging your pardon,

01:07:14.473 --> 01:07:16.600
I do believe Mr. Smith
made good sense.

01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:18.394
We must all go together.

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:20.229
What are you saying?

01:07:20.438 --> 01:07:22.314
Are you contradicting me?

01:07:22.523 --> 01:07:26.819
Just because of one small crisis,
you want to run?

01:07:27.027 --> 01:07:30.364
Mr. Crockett,
really, it's not a small crisis.

01:07:30.573 --> 01:07:31.866
You got to see that.

01:07:32.074 --> 01:07:35.870
I see who's loyal and who isn't.
That's what I see.

01:07:37.371 --> 01:07:40.791
Now, if you wanna go,
both of you, well, go.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.960
Do you?

01:07:43.169 --> 01:07:48.632
Maybe you haven't heard about it,
stuck out here in vacationland,

01:07:48.841 --> 01:07:50.968
but five score
and seven years ago,

01:07:51.177 --> 01:07:54.972
they just started letting people
make up their own mind.

01:07:56.599 --> 01:07:59.768
Mr. Crockett,
I wish you'd change your mind,

01:07:59.977 --> 01:08:01.187
for your own safety.

01:08:01.395 --> 01:08:04.064
- Mr. Crockett--
- Do you want to leave?

01:08:04.273 --> 01:08:06.108
Then leave. Get out!

01:08:06.317 --> 01:08:08.319
All three of you, go on!

01:08:08.527 --> 01:08:10.863
- Clint?
- Yes, sir?

01:08:11.071 --> 01:08:12.990
Take 'em across the lake
and leave 'em.

01:08:13.199 --> 01:08:16.202
Take a good look round.
Then get right back here!

01:08:17.703 --> 01:08:19.412
I can take care of that, sir.

01:08:19.622 --> 01:08:23.417
Ladies, gentleman,
you have about five minutes.

01:08:25.002 --> 01:08:26.252
Thank you.

01:08:28.214 --> 01:08:31.884
Thank you so much
for your hospitality.

01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:35.554
I'll write you my thank-you note
when I get back to civilization.

01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:40.684
You're in for one hell of a battle,
Mr. Crockett.

01:08:40.893 --> 01:08:42.685
You better get ready for it.

01:10:11.025 --> 01:10:12.151
Jessie?

01:10:13.485 --> 01:10:16.155
Jessie?
Damn it, where are you?

01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:18.300
Pickett, is there anything
we can do to help?

01:11:18.509 --> 01:11:19.885
No, nothing.

01:11:20.094 --> 01:11:22.054
Either one of you know
how to handle these things?

01:11:22.262 --> 01:11:25.015
- I'm afraid not.
- I've always hated guns.

01:11:25.224 --> 01:11:28.310
Karen, even under these
circumstances,

01:11:28.519 --> 01:11:30.813
is there any reason
why we can't get something to eat?

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:31.980
Of course not, Grandpa.

01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:33.941
I guess the kids
must be pretty hungry, too.

01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:35.442
What would you like?

01:11:35.651 --> 01:11:37.778
I'd like the menu
that was originally planned,

01:11:37.986 --> 01:11:40.489
starting with a double
old-fashioned for me.

01:11:40.698 --> 01:11:43.617
- All right.
- Well, where's Clint?

01:11:43.826 --> 01:11:45.202
Shouldn't he
have been back by now?

01:11:45.411 --> 01:11:48.831
All depends on how many beers
he took with him, doesn't it?

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:51.250
Yeah, I guess so.

01:13:12.289 --> 01:13:14.166
Clint?

01:13:58.001 --> 01:13:59.753
Clint!

01:14:07.636 --> 01:14:09.179
Clint!

01:14:20.399 --> 01:14:22.526
Help!

01:14:22.734 --> 01:14:25.112
Aah! Help!

01:14:45.007 --> 01:14:47.175
My God.

01:14:47.384 --> 01:14:49.761
They're all over out there.

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:52.973
- Got any gasoline around here?
- In the tool shed.

01:15:38.393 --> 01:15:40.437
- Here, Grandpa.
- Thank you.

01:15:40.646 --> 01:15:42.648
You see that?
Soon as I went after them,

01:15:42.856 --> 01:15:45.817
- they scattered.
- And very intelligently, too.

01:15:46.026 --> 01:15:47.653
The frogs are thinking now.

01:15:47.861 --> 01:15:50.030
The snails are planning strategy.

01:15:50.238 --> 01:15:53.158
They have brains as good as ours.
Is that your point?

01:15:53.367 --> 01:15:55.994
- Where's Mommy and Daddy?
- Where's Mommy, Karen?

01:15:56.203 --> 01:15:58.121
Well, your Daddy hasn't come back
from across the lake yet,

01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.582
but I think your Mommy
just went outside.

01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:02.459
- I didn't see her out there.
- Mommy!

01:16:02.668 --> 01:16:04.670
Wait!

01:16:04.878 --> 01:16:08.298
Mommy, Mommy! Mommy!

01:16:08.507 --> 01:16:10.050
Mommy!

01:16:11.468 --> 01:16:12.511
Pickett?

01:16:14.972 --> 01:16:15.931
That settles it.
We're leaving. Come on.

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:19.685
Where are they, Karen?
Why isn't Daddy in the boat?

01:16:19.893 --> 01:16:21.979
We don't know, darling.
We just don't know.

01:16:22.187 --> 01:16:24.314
How we gonna leave?

01:16:26.274 --> 01:16:28.360
Like chickens
with their heads cut off.

01:16:28.568 --> 01:16:29.903
Grandpa Crockett,
Daddy's not in the boat

01:16:30.112 --> 01:16:32.531
and it's out there all by itself.

01:16:32.739 --> 01:16:35.951
She's right, Mr. Crockett.
There's no one in it.

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:38.620
- We're all leaving now.
- The Crocketts are staying!

01:16:38.829 --> 01:16:40.497
Grandpa, after all that's
happened today,

01:16:40.706 --> 01:16:42.541
do you think it makes
any difference whether we stay?

01:16:42.749 --> 01:16:45.043
I'm staying,
and you're staying.

01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:49.006
But don't you understand?
I can't let the children stay.

01:16:49.214 --> 01:16:51.341
And I can't let you stay either.

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:54.344
If anyone gives orders
in this house, I do.

01:16:54.553 --> 01:16:56.847
If you want to disobey me,
all right, go ahead.

01:16:57.055 --> 01:16:59.349
I thought you, at least,
were different.

01:16:59.558 --> 01:17:02.060
Thought you had
the Crockett strength, the guts.

01:17:02.269 --> 01:17:05.063
But if you want to leave, go.

01:17:05.272 --> 01:17:07.024
Go on.
Get the hell out of here.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.568
Just stand up and be counted.

01:17:10.652 --> 01:17:12.404
That means are you with me
or against me?

01:17:12.612 --> 01:17:13.780
You understand?

01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:23.040
Are you gonna be all right?

01:17:23.248 --> 01:17:26.877
You worried about me?
Well, thank you for your concern.

01:17:27.085 --> 01:17:30.172
I'm going to be perfectly all right.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:31.965
I get into that elevator by myself.

01:17:32.174 --> 01:17:34.342
I get into bed by myself.

01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:37.262
That's where I'm going,
and I'm going to sleep like a baby.

01:17:38.722 --> 01:17:41.016
- Can I take that shotgun?
- Take anything you like.

01:17:42.476 --> 01:17:44.436
Don't bring it back.

01:17:52.569 --> 01:17:54.821
Many happy returns of the day.

01:17:56.323 --> 01:17:57.908
To me.

01:18:03.914 --> 01:18:05.040
Okay, let's go.

01:18:10.462 --> 01:18:12.339
Bye, Grandpa.

01:18:19.596 --> 01:18:20.764
Grandpa?

01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:33.399
Okay, kids, we're leaving.

01:18:33.527 --> 01:18:35.320
You're gonna have a chance
for one Fourth of July race anyway.

01:18:35.529 --> 01:18:36.780
Now, when I say,
I want you very carefully

01:18:36.988 --> 01:18:38.323
to run down to the dock, okay?

01:18:38.532 --> 01:18:41.701
And watch out for the frogs.
On your mark, get set, go!

01:19:14.025 --> 01:19:15.819
Stay with 'em a minute.

01:19:33.253 --> 01:19:36.173
Oh, my God!

01:19:49.477 --> 01:19:51.897
- What's wrong, Karen?
- Nothing, darling.

01:20:00.238 --> 01:20:01.990
- Stay down. Keep real little.
- Okay.

01:20:02.199 --> 01:20:04.534
- Hold on to the sides.
- Okay.

01:20:07.746 --> 01:20:09.539
Keep real steady.

01:20:53.124 --> 01:20:55.710
- What happened?
- We're on a snag.

01:20:59.923 --> 01:21:01.049
Damn.

01:21:09.182 --> 01:21:11.309
Pickett, be careful.

01:21:17.691 --> 01:21:19.776
- Aah!
- Oh, Jesus!

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.033
Pickett--

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:35.458
Damn.

01:23:11.888 --> 01:23:13.056
Hello?

01:23:16.101 --> 01:23:17.143
Hello?

01:23:19.854 --> 01:23:21.856
- Nobody here.
- Karen?

01:23:22.065 --> 01:23:24.359
Oh, darling, just hold my hand.
Come on. Get going.

01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:03.022
Come on.

01:24:34.387 --> 01:24:36.431
Hello.
Is anything wrong?

01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:38.519
We had a little trouble.
Can you give us a lift?

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.767
Oh, sure, I'd be glad to.

01:24:39.976 --> 01:24:42.187
- Hop in.
- Great. Come on!

01:25:09.172 --> 01:25:10.882
Did your car break down?

01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:14.802
No, it's a long story.
Thanks for stopping.

01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:17.555
Well, we're headed
for Jefferson City.

01:25:17.764 --> 01:25:19.807
I just picked
my son up at camp.

01:25:20.016 --> 01:25:22.227
- Hi. I'm Bobby.
- Hi.

01:25:22.435 --> 01:25:25.730
We've been on this road
for practically three hours straight,

01:25:25.939 --> 01:25:28.525
and you're the first souls
we've seen in an hour.

01:25:28.733 --> 01:25:30.652
It seems very strange

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:33.363
that everybody's disappeared
inside on a holiday.

01:25:33.571 --> 01:25:35.198
Hey, wanna see
what I caught?

01:25:37.033 --> 01:25:38.826
They were all over the place at camp.

01:25:39.035 --> 01:25:40.578
Ever seen a monster
big as him before?

01:26:24.706 --> 01:26:27.667
Quiet, Colonel!

01:27:02.994 --> 01:27:04.037
Colonel!

01:27:16.966 --> 01:27:19.385
Hello? Hello?

01:27:20.595 --> 01:27:22.472
Hello!

01:27:25.183 --> 01:27:27.226
Hello?

01:27:27.435 --> 01:27:30.271
But it can't be dead.
It rang!

01:27:32.065 --> 01:27:34.525
Oh-- oh--
