00:01.334 --> 00:04.133
<i>Kids, as you know,
Aunt Robin grew up in Canada.</i>

00:04.133 --> 00:06.434
<i>That meant sometimes she
dressed a little differently.</i>

00:06.434 --> 00:09.067
Okay, let's do this!

00:09.067 --> 00:12.367
<i>Sometimes she talked
a little differently.</i>

00:12.367 --> 00:14.868
Ted, this hydro bill is bigger
than Louis Cyr's biceps.

00:14.868 --> 00:18.000
What, you leave the garburator
on all night, eh?

00:19.300 --> 00:20.901
<i>She hung out at different bars</i>

00:20.901 --> 00:23.000
<i>and enjoyed leisure time
a little differently.</i>

00:23.000 --> 00:26.934
You want to go?
You want to go?! Come on!

00:26.934 --> 00:29.167
Make fun of the Great
White North all you want.

00:29.167 --> 00:30.934
It's the best country
in the world.

00:31.467 --> 00:32.534
The...
Mmmm.

00:32.534 --> 00:33.434
Social experiment.

00:33.434 --> 00:40.033
U.S.A., U.S.A.

00:40.033 --> 00:42.534
Okay, okay.
You know what,

00:42.534 --> 00:43.701
What does that even prove, okay?

00:43.701 --> 00:45.634
You chant anything,
people will join in.

00:45.634 --> 00:49.601
Canada, Canada,

00:49.601 --> 00:51.901
Cana...
Okay, they won't chant anything.

00:51.901 --> 00:54.400
Shrimp fried rice,

00:54.400 --> 00:58.400
Shrimp fried rice,
Shrimp fried rice,

00:58.400 --> 01:00.300
Shrimp fried rice,
Shrimp fried rice...

01:00.300 --> 01:02.868
Shrimp fried rice--
totally.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.601
Anyway, speaking of food,

01:05.601 --> 01:07.133
Marshall, I've got
so bad news.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.067
Just read online,
Gazzola's is closing.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.133
No!

01:10.133 --> 01:11.334
What's Gazzola's?

01:11.334 --> 01:14.901
A filthy mecca of spectacular
if undercooked pizza

01:14.901 --> 01:17.801
located at 316 Kinzie Street,
Chicago, Illinois.

01:17.801 --> 01:20.334
Back in college, Ted and I used
to take these crazy road trips

01:20.334 --> 01:21.868
from Connecticut
all the way to Chicago

01:21.868 --> 01:22.934
Just for a Gazzola's pizza.

01:22.934 --> 01:24.033
22 hours.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.467
No map.

01:25.467 --> 01:27.133
We'd just jump in
the Fiero and drive.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.667
We were like Lewis and Clark,

01:28.667 --> 01:30.801
if Lewis and Clark peed
in empty soda bottles

01:30.801 --> 01:32.801
and had a bong made
out of a cantaloupe.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.334
Man, those Gazzola trips,

01:35.334 --> 01:38.100
that's... that's when
we really became bros.

01:38.801 --> 01:40.367
Mm. We ate nothing
but jerky.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.300
Drank nothing but Tantrum.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.033
<i>Ah, Tantrum.</i>

01:43.033 --> 01:46.334
<i>Tantrum was a soft drink with
the highest caffeine content</i>

01:46.334 --> 01:48.601
<i>legally available
over the counter.</i>

01:48.601 --> 01:49.734
<i>It was eventually discontinued</i>

01:49.734 --> 01:53.133
<i>after an extensive study
by the FDA.</i>

01:55.968 --> 01:59.234
Oh, man, we went through a whole case
of Tantrum one trip.

01:59.234 --> 02:01.767
I was color-blind for
two weeks after that.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.934
I think that's the reason
that I pass out

02:03.934 --> 02:05.834
when I hear church bells.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.032
It's probably a good thing
they're closing Gazzola's.

02:08.032 --> 02:09.667
Those trips were
brutal, right?

02:09.667 --> 02:12.734
The long hours in the car,
the motion sickness, the smell.

02:12.734 --> 02:16.534
So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?
I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.

02:29.501 --> 02:31.367
I am ready to hit the road.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.567
I got baby wipes.

02:32.567 --> 02:34.133
I got a variety of jerky.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.801
I got six cans of Tantrum.

02:35.801 --> 02:37.200
Well, four.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.534
One burned through the can,
the other one I drank already.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.334
Tantrum!

02:41.334 --> 02:43.868
I am so psyched! Marshall and I

02:43.868 --> 02:46.033
haven't done something, just
the two of us, for so long.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.067
Ever since he got married, he's
turned from an "I" to a "we."

02:49.067 --> 02:50.100
What do you mean?

02:50.100 --> 02:51.300
Think about it.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.801
Hey, haven't seen you all week.
How you doing?

02:53.801 --> 02:55.601
We're doing great.

02:55.601 --> 02:57.467
Did you watch the Jets game?

02:57.467 --> 02:59.067
We most certainly did.

02:59.067 --> 03:01.701
How'd things go at the doctor?

03:01.701 --> 03:05.934
We no longer have
a hemorrhoid problem.

03:07.334 --> 03:08.367
Hmm.

03:08.367 --> 03:09.567
You guys will not believe this.

03:09.567 --> 03:11.534
I've been talking
to my lawyer all morning.

03:11.534 --> 03:12.501
You know that guy I have

03:12.501 --> 03:13.834
a slight disagreement

03:13.834 --> 03:16.100
with at the Hoser Hut?
He's filing assault charges.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.234
Come on!

03:17.234 --> 03:18.801
I broke his nose with a chair.

03:18.801 --> 03:22.067
And now, apparently, I may
end up getting deported.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.667
Oh, my God, that sucks!
Yeah.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.400
I'm gonna go do push-ups
in the kitchen.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.901
Tantrum!

03:26.901 --> 03:30.334
Well, there's only one possible
way to avoid getting deported.

03:30.334 --> 03:33.634
My lawyer said I could
become an American citizen.

03:33.634 --> 03:35.734
Perfect. Problem solved.
Welcome aboard.

03:35.734 --> 03:37.234
Well, it's not that simple.

03:37.234 --> 03:39.467
I'm a Canadian.
I was born there.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.334
My family's there.
It's who I am.

03:41.334 --> 03:44.067
I know, and it's provided us
with a lot of laughs.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.067
But, Robin,

03:45.067 --> 03:47.434
if you want to live here,
work here

03:47.434 --> 03:50.534
and throw chairs at people here,
you have to do this.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.067
Well, there's a citizenship
test tomorrow.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.133
A cit...
I'll think about it.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.234
No, no, you have to do it.

03:56.234 --> 03:57.734
I'll help you study.

03:57.734 --> 03:59.267
We're gonna stay up
all night long.

03:59.267 --> 04:01.601
I'm gonna drill you,
and then we're gonna study.

04:01.601 --> 04:02.801
No, seriously.

04:02.801 --> 04:03.901
We're gonna do some cramming

04:03.901 --> 04:05.067
and then we're gonna study.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.467
No, seriously. We're
gonna bone up on...

04:07.467 --> 04:08.734
Okay, Barney.
Sorry.

04:08.734 --> 04:10.367
It's a rich area.
It is.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.734
But you know, it's not
going to be easy, this test.

04:12.734 --> 04:15.200
It's not like the Canadian
citizenship test.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.166
How do you know
the Canadian test is easy?

04:17.166 --> 04:18.934
It's Canada.

04:18.934 --> 04:21.733
Do you want
to be Canadian?

04:21.733 --> 04:23.834
Really?

04:24.300 --> 04:25.567
Ted! Ted!

04:25.567 --> 04:26.868
Check it out!

04:26.868 --> 04:29.701
I got black coffee on the left,
I got Tantrum on the right!

04:29.701 --> 04:32.133
Do you have a phone book?!
Yes, I do!

04:32.133 --> 04:34.067
I don't know why they make
phone books anymore.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.200
Everything's online, right?

04:36.601 --> 04:38.133
Tantrum!
Tantrum!

04:39.033 --> 04:41.234
All right, let's hit the road.

04:41.234 --> 04:42.601
You invited Lily?

04:42.601 --> 04:44.033
We most certainly did!

04:45.400 --> 04:48.734
I don't know if you caught that,
but he did the "we" thing.

04:48.734 --> 04:50.767
Yeah, I heard him.
Okay.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.834
Road trip!

04:53.834 --> 04:55.667
So you guys want to talk
about bitches?

04:55.667 --> 04:59.167
I'm kidding.
They're called women.

04:59.167 --> 05:02.834
All right, next stop: Chicago.

05:02.834 --> 05:03.934
I have to pee.

05:03.934 --> 05:06.334
Couldn't you have gone
before we left?

05:06.334 --> 05:07.834
I did. I just pee a lot.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.133
You'll see.

05:15.701 --> 05:17.767
Don't worry,
we'll get out on the road,

05:17.767 --> 05:19.100
it'll be just like old times.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.901
<i>It wasn't.</i>

05:20.901 --> 05:24.300
* I would walk 500 miles

05:24.300 --> 05:27.834
* And I would walk 500 more...

05:27.834 --> 05:30.267
Sugar snap pea?

05:30.267 --> 05:31.501
Pea...

05:31.501 --> 05:33.300
That reminds me, I have to pee.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.834
Okay, straight,
straight, straight.

05:36.834 --> 05:38.801
Now, wait, a little
to the left.

05:38.801 --> 05:41.534
We'll pass a state trooper.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.901
Ooh, punch buggy yellow!

05:43.901 --> 05:44.968
Ow!

05:44.968 --> 05:47.267
Yellow-- that reminds me,
I have to pee.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.167
Thank you!

05:54.734 --> 05:56.434
Great.

05:56.434 --> 05:57.434
Oh, hey, Ted...

05:57.434 --> 05:58.868
You can't have
to go again.

05:58.868 --> 06:00.334
It's not humanly
possible.

06:00.334 --> 06:03.234
No, I was just going to say
maybe we should listen to something.

06:03.234 --> 06:06.033
Oh, that's a great idea.
I think I have some Jerky Boys.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.667
<i>Good-bye, Sparky.</i>

06:07.667 --> 06:10.367
It's an audio book
about a boy and his dog.

06:10.367 --> 06:12.367
It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.

06:12.367 --> 06:16.200
<i>Good-bye Sparky,
by Nick Leotti.</i>

06:16.200 --> 06:18.033
Read to you by Kenny Rogers.

06:18.033 --> 06:19.167
Oh!

06:19.167 --> 06:22.100
When I first saw Sparky,

06:22.100 --> 06:24.367
he reminded me of
my favorite comb;

06:24.367 --> 06:27.634
he was missing a lot of teeth,
but I loved him anyway.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.367
Mother was fit to be tied

06:29.367 --> 06:32.000
every time he used
her prized rhododendron

06:32.000 --> 06:33.434
to do his business.

06:34.868 --> 06:37.100
That reminds me,
I have to pee.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.300
"How many stars
are on the flag?"

06:39.300 --> 06:40.868
50-- one for each state.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.501
"What are
the first ten amendments

06:42.501 --> 06:43.534
to the Constitution called?"

06:43.534 --> 06:44.834
The Bill of Rights.

06:44.834 --> 06:47.033
Look, Barney, I know
all this. I'm ready.

06:47.033 --> 06:50.133
Ready for the test maybe,
but ready to be an American?

06:50.133 --> 06:51.467
Not on your sweet life.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.267
For you to be an American,

06:53.267 --> 06:54.901
we got to get the Canadian
out of you.

06:54.901 --> 06:57.968
That's why I've created
these questions.

06:57.968 --> 07:01.100
"Who is this?"

07:01.100 --> 07:02.167
Queen Elizabeth II.

07:02.167 --> 07:04.567
No, the answer is Elton John.

07:05.501 --> 07:08.434
"What the hell is this?"

07:08.434 --> 07:09.534
Oh, curling.

07:09.534 --> 07:10.834
Um, it's a sport played...

07:10.834 --> 07:12.901
Wrong. The answer
we were looking for

07:12.901 --> 07:14.567
was "I don't care, it's dumb."

07:14.567 --> 07:16.400
Let's go buy something
that's bad for us

07:16.400 --> 07:18.234
and then sue the people
who made it.

07:18.234 --> 07:19.467
That's America, Robin.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.868
...because Sparky loved
chasing a ball,

07:22.868 --> 07:25.067
and it didn't much matter
what kind.

07:25.067 --> 07:28.267
Tennis ball, baseball,
Wiffle ball,

07:28.267 --> 07:30.267
golf ball, basketball,

07:30.267 --> 07:32.334
beach ball, gum ball,

07:32.334 --> 07:34.234
a grapefruit-- which isn't
actually a ball,

07:34.234 --> 07:35.667
but 's round like a ball--

07:35.667 --> 07:37.234
a football-- which isn't round,

07:37.234 --> 07:39.634
but it's still technically
a ball--

07:39.634 --> 07:40.868
Indian rubber ball...

07:40.868 --> 07:43.901
This ends disk seven.

07:43.901 --> 07:47.300
The audio book continues
on disk eight.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.567
Disk eight.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.300
Lacrosse ball, volleyball...

07:53.300 --> 07:56.067
Oh, my God, Lily, please
tell me you have to go pee!

07:56.067 --> 07:58.100
Ah, I do.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.834
<i>It was the worst trip ever,</i>

07:59.834 --> 08:01.234
<i>but then it got worse.</i>

08:01.234 --> 08:03.167
Well, don't worry, the
next exit's the hotel.

08:03.167 --> 08:04.334
We can go there.

08:04.334 --> 08:05.801
Hotel?

08:05.801 --> 08:07.968
<i>Crumpet Manor is listed</i>

08:07.968 --> 08:10.434
in the American Registry
of Historic Bed-and-Breakfasts.

08:10.434 --> 08:14.901
Our door is opened
on Christmas day, 1881.

08:14.901 --> 08:17.834
And we have catered
to couples ever since.

08:17.834 --> 08:21.801
Well, I mean, single people
can have fun here, too, right?

08:21.801 --> 08:24.367
Oh, I suppose I could arrange
a little recreation.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.234
Do you enjoy sitting
on a bench?

08:30.968 --> 08:32.601
And by the end of the night, Barney
had turned Robin into a real American.

08:32.601 --> 08:34.801
I want to say-- Jefferson?

08:34.801 --> 08:36.000
Correct.
Oh!

08:36.000 --> 08:39.567
Archie Bunker's neighbor
was George Jefferson.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.601
Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this.

08:41.601 --> 08:42.767
God, I'm buzzing

08:42.767 --> 08:44.901
On America right now!
All right, hold your horses.

08:44.901 --> 08:47.467
Now to prove that you are
as American as apple pie

08:47.467 --> 08:50.300
and the childhood obesity
it leads to--

08:50.300 --> 08:53.200
who is this?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.567
That, Barney,

08:55.567 --> 08:59.501
is the American actor,
beloved by millions,

08:59.501 --> 09:03.167
<i>the "Hey, Vern" guy from the
popular series of Ernest films.</i>

09:03.167 --> 09:05.601
And his name...

09:05.601 --> 09:08.567
Jeff Foxworthy.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.467
Jeff Foxworthy?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.133
No, it's Jim Varney.

09:12.133 --> 09:13.767
You're kidding me.
You don't know that?

09:13.767 --> 09:16.100
Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy,
dumbass.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.434
End of story.
Now shut your stupid face.

09:18.434 --> 09:21.234
Not only are you wrong,

09:21.234 --> 09:23.901
but you are belligerently
sticking to your guns

09:23.901 --> 09:25.868
and insulting me
in the process.

09:26.534 --> 09:29.367
Robin Scherbatsky--

09:29.367 --> 09:31.834
you are an American.

09:33.234 --> 09:36.467
Look who's back
from the wishing well.

09:36.467 --> 09:39.200
It didn't work,
I'm still here.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.501
Marshall, what are we doing?

09:41.501 --> 09:42.801
We should be on the road.

09:42.801 --> 09:45.367
Ok, Ted, we're not
in college anymore, okay?

09:45.367 --> 09:46.901
We don't have
to drive all night.

09:46.901 --> 09:50.167
Besides, they have a spa.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.968
All our spa treatments
are designed for couples.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.000
Would you
be interested

09:54.000 --> 09:58.534
in the two-person,
cornmeal body scrub?

09:58.534 --> 10:00.667
<i>And then finally it happened.</i>

10:00.667 --> 10:03.868
<i>Marshall and Lily globbed
into one big married glob.</i>

10:03.868 --> 10:07.934
We'd love a cornmeal
body scrub!

10:07.934 --> 10:09.400
Whoa.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.534
I got to dial back
on the Tantrum.

10:13.534 --> 10:17.534
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be
an American, y'all.</i>

10:18.834 --> 10:20.634
<i>Maybe I'll rob a liquor store.
Maybe I won't.</i>

10:20.634 --> 10:21.834
<i>My choice.</i>

10:21.834 --> 10:25.534
Learn English!

10:26.868 --> 10:28.501
<i>The Hoser Hut.</i>

10:29.501 --> 10:31.267
<i>I could duck in for a drink.</i>

10:31.267 --> 10:32.734
<i>No, no, that life's behind me.</i>

10:32.734 --> 10:34.501
<i>Forget it.</i>

10:34.501 --> 10:37.033
<i>Well, I could in
for just one beer.</i>

10:37.033 --> 10:38.300
<i>What's the harm in that?</i>

10:38.300 --> 10:39.634
<i>It's a free country.</i>

10:39.634 --> 10:43.000
* O Canada

10:43.000 --> 10:47.300
* Our home and native land...

10:47.300 --> 10:48.834
Oh, God, I miss it.

10:48.834 --> 10:51.968
* True patriots love...

10:57.200 --> 10:58.667
Hey, man.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.200
Shh.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.334
Sorry about
what I said before.

11:01.334 --> 11:03.601
You want to go to the store
and get some beer?

11:05.767 --> 11:07.234
Lily is asleep.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.767
I suppose I could
reschedule my pedicure.

11:10.567 --> 11:12.467
What the hell?
But only light beer

11:12.467 --> 11:14.000
because we have a couple
hike in the morning.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.467
Dude, why are we pulling
to the highway?

11:22.400 --> 11:25.667
Ted, where exactly
are we going to get this beer?

11:26.767 --> 11:28.133
Chicago.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.000
What are you doing?
We can't just leave Lily.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.334
When she wakes up,
she's going to freak!

11:34.334 --> 11:36.234
She'll have a back rub
and a crumpet.

11:36.234 --> 11:39.267
She'll be fine.
Relax. Have some fun.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.367
I just abandoned my wife.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.434
How am I supposed to have fun?

11:43.434 --> 11:46.834
* And I would walk 500 miles

11:46.834 --> 11:50.667
* And I would walk 500 more...

11:50.667 --> 11:51.667
Hey, you really think
Lily's pissed?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.334
If she's pissed, she's pissed.

11:53.334 --> 11:54.801
Pfft.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.200
<i>When Barney finally</i>

11:56.200 --> 11:58.200
<i>tracked down your Aunt Robin,</i>

11:58.200 --> 11:59.501
<i>it wasn't a pretty sight.</i>

11:59.501 --> 12:01.267
Good morning.

12:03.534 --> 12:04.667
Barney?

12:04.667 --> 12:08.267
Oh, my God.
What happened last night?

12:08.267 --> 12:11.133
You went Canadian.

12:11.133 --> 12:13.267
How Canadian?

12:13.267 --> 12:16.267
This Canadian.

12:18.033 --> 12:21.000
Oh. That was supposed
to be a dramatic view

12:21.000 --> 12:23.167
of the Toronto sky--
you're in Toronto.

12:24.501 --> 12:26.534
Oh, God.

12:26.534 --> 12:29.467
Okay. It's coming back to me.

12:29.467 --> 12:32.267
I, uh, I went
into the Hoser Hut..

12:33.467 --> 12:36.400
And I met this
women's curling team

12:36.400 --> 12:38.067
<i>We started drinking.</i>

12:38.067 --> 12:40.000
<i>And the next thing I know,
they're inviting me</i>

12:40.000 --> 12:43.467
<i>to a Bryan Adams/Rich tittle
double bill in Toronto.</i>

12:43.467 --> 12:45.868
How did you find me, anyway?

12:45.868 --> 12:48.167
You called me,
said you were never coming back.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.167
So, I jumped on a plane,
flew across the Atlantic...

12:51.167 --> 12:53.200
Canada isn't
across the Atlantic.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.501
You're talking nonsense.

12:54.501 --> 12:56.033
Now, listen...

12:56.033 --> 12:58.300
You slipped up. It's fine.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.634
The test is in a few hours.

12:59.634 --> 13:02.000
Barney,
I'm not taking the test.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.501
God, you're still drunk.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.834
Look, I-I appreciate
your help, but...

13:06.834 --> 13:09.734
who am I kidding?
I'm Canadian.

13:09.734 --> 13:11.200
I always will be.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.868
Now, that's ridiculous.

13:13.868 --> 13:17.033
We're gonna get some coffee
In you, we'll sober you up,

13:17.033 --> 13:19.200
and get you back
to New York for that test.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.167
But, before any of that,

13:21.167 --> 13:23.467
we're gonna do it on this bed

13:23.467 --> 13:25.033
'cause... hotel room.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.200
Okay, let's get some coffee.

13:32.334 --> 13:34.033
Kind of gross.
You're making me wonder

13:34.033 --> 13:36.467
if this pizza is worth
the 22-hour drive.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.400
Just like old times!

13:38.400 --> 13:41.801
I feel so young again
except for the chest pains.

13:41.801 --> 13:42.901
But the crust is so good.

13:42.901 --> 13:44.567
What is the secret
to this crust?

13:44.567 --> 13:46.033
It's no big secret.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.334
It's made of cornmeal.

13:47.334 --> 13:49.601
Cornmeal...

13:49.601 --> 13:54.300
We'd love a
cornmeal body scrub!

13:54.300 --> 13:56.400
I can't believe
you guys are closing.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.634
I can't believe
we're still open.

13:58.634 --> 14:01.100
Gotcha!

14:01.100 --> 14:03.334
These are getting bigger.

14:05.601 --> 14:07.767
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.

14:07.767 --> 14:10.267
Yeah, give me
two coffees.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.901
$3.50, please.

14:11.901 --> 14:13.834
Hey, what did you think of
the game last night?

14:13.834 --> 14:14.901
What game?

14:14.901 --> 14:16.467
The Leafs beat Edmonton.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.968
Beauchemin went five hole in OT.

14:18.968 --> 14:20.501
Oh, I guess I missed it.

14:20.501 --> 14:22.100
Oh, sorry. You're American.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.701
Here's your change.

14:23.701 --> 14:24.767
I'm not American.

14:24.767 --> 14:25.968
American money?

14:25.968 --> 14:27.200
Didn't watch the Leafs game?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.300
No "please" or "thank you"
for the coffee?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.367
You sure don't seem
like a Canadian.

14:34.534 --> 14:36.667
What's wrong?
Other than the fact

14:36.667 --> 14:39.567
that this five-dollar bill
they gave you is blue.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.801
Wow. I'm not American,

14:41.801 --> 14:43.834
and apparently,
I'm not Canadian either.

14:43.834 --> 14:47.367
And there's kids
playing hokey on the back.

14:47.367 --> 14:52.200
It's like you want us
to make fun of you.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.601
I don't want this anymore.

14:55.601 --> 14:58.133
Dude, don't look at it.
That's a rookie mistake.

14:58.133 --> 14:59.501
We shouldn't have left Lily.

14:59.501 --> 15:00.501
Well, if you're so worried,

15:00.501 --> 15:01.634
why don't you give her a call?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.467
I have.
I left her, like, 20 messages.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.901
I said, "I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

15:05.901 --> 15:07.000
It's all Ted's fault!"

15:07.000 --> 15:09.467
What exactly is "Ted's fault"?

15:09.467 --> 15:10.734
This! This whole thing!

15:10.734 --> 15:12.000
We were having
a perfectly nice trip,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.167
and then you kidnapped me.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.567
You didn't even let me
put on underwear!

15:14.567 --> 15:16.767
We never used to
put on underwear!

15:19.801 --> 15:21.634
That was the fun of a
bro's trip to Gazzola's!

15:21.634 --> 15:24.234
We left everything,
and everyone behind.

15:24.234 --> 15:25.534
It was just you and me!

15:25.534 --> 15:28.734
But now it's like you've
disappeared into Lily.

15:28.734 --> 15:29.734
That is not true.

15:29.734 --> 15:31.267
It is true. You're not upset

15:31.267 --> 15:32.734
because you're worried she's
mad. You're upset because

15:32.734 --> 15:34.267
you'd rather be with her,
eating muffins

15:34.267 --> 15:36.567
than here with me,
eating this delicious...

15:36.567 --> 15:38.901
I think one of my mushrooms
just crawled away.

15:39.968 --> 15:41.334
Well, you know what?

15:41.334 --> 15:44.234
That mushroom's not the only
thing that's leaving.

15:46.734 --> 15:48.100
Car keys, please.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.767
Look at this money!

16:03.767 --> 16:06.501
This one has a moose,
this one has a beaver,

16:06.501 --> 16:08.601
and they all have
Elton John on the back.

16:10.367 --> 16:11.601
When I moved to the States,

16:11.601 --> 16:13.667
I swore to myself,
I wasn't going to change.

16:13.667 --> 16:17.667
And yet, here I am, in the most
Canadian place in the universe--

16:17.667 --> 16:20.634
Tim Horton's-- around the corner
from the Hockey Hall of Fame,

16:20.634 --> 16:23.167
and I don't belong.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.367
It's like I don't
have a country.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.934
Okay, that's it.

16:29.634 --> 16:31.634
Attention, Canada!

16:32.601 --> 16:34.434
I am Barney from America.

16:34.434 --> 16:37.100
And I'm here to fix
your backward-ass country.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.634
get real money.

16:39.634 --> 16:42.934
Don't know what board game this
came from, but it's a "jhoke."

16:42.934 --> 16:46.701
Number two--
and this is the biggie--

16:46.701 --> 16:50.067
Quit letting awesome chicks like
Robin Scherbatsky get away

16:50.067 --> 16:51.434
because, guess what?

16:51.434 --> 16:53.968
You don't want her?
I'm planting my flag in her--

16:53.968 --> 16:56.267
if you know what I mean,
which you probably don't--

16:56.267 --> 16:58.367
and getting her
the hell out of here.

16:59.334 --> 17:01.334
You may now return
to being pointless.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.334
<i>Ah, this coffee is excellent.</i>

17:12.300 --> 17:15.968
Oh. Hey, fellas.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.501
It's called a "tie."

17:28.434 --> 17:32.667
Sparky was my best friend,
but after I married Helen,

17:32.667 --> 17:36.934
old Spark started to feel
a little left out.

17:36.934 --> 17:39.601
For so long,
it had been just me and him,

17:39.601 --> 17:43.200
but now he suddenly felt
like Helen had taken his place.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.467
What Sparky didn't realize was,
even though I loved Helen,

17:47.467 --> 17:49.334
I still loved him, too.

17:49.334 --> 17:52.067
I had room in my heart
for both of them.

17:52.067 --> 17:54.000
But maybe
I should have put aside

17:54.000 --> 17:56.801
some special ball-tossing time
just for the two of us

17:56.801 --> 18:00.701
to make sure Sparky knew
that he was a good boy.

18:00.701 --> 18:02.634
I wish now I had,

18:02.634 --> 18:05.334
'cause old Sparky ran out
in front of a Cadillac

18:05.334 --> 18:07.567
and got splattered
like a watermelon

18:07.567 --> 18:09.567
in one of them Gallagher shows.

18:09.567 --> 18:11.300
I'm sorry, Ted!
I'm sorry!

18:11.300 --> 18:12.367
No, I'm sorry.

18:12.367 --> 18:13.501
I never should have
been mad at you!

18:13.501 --> 18:14.701
No, I never should
have brought Lily.

18:14.701 --> 18:17.467
She pees all the time,
even at the apartment.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.901
Still bros?

18:19.901 --> 18:21.834
Best bros.

18:23.267 --> 18:26.167
Hey, you want to crank some
Van Halen just like old times?

18:26.167 --> 18:27.100
Hells, yeah!

18:27.100 --> 18:29.400
Or listen to the
Sparky book again?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.801
Listen to the
Sparky book again.

18:30.801 --> 18:31.934
Okay. Let's listen
to it again.

18:31.934 --> 18:36.067
Man, those Canadian
doctors banded me up,

18:36.067 --> 18:39.801
reset my jaw, put my shoulder
back in its socket,

18:39.801 --> 18:42.267
and they didn't even bill me.
Idiots.

18:43.934 --> 18:46.067
All right,
I guess they're not idiots.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.767
The coffee was extraordinary.

18:47.767 --> 18:49.834
Huh.

18:49.834 --> 18:52.334
I guess Canada's not so bad.

18:52.334 --> 18:54.400
They play their cards right,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.467
maybe they can even
become a state someday.

18:56.467 --> 18:59.601
Barney, I've thought about this.

18:59.601 --> 19:01.667
When you stood up and
told off those people,

19:01.667 --> 19:05.434
I thought, "Yeah, America's cool."
Hmm.

19:05.434 --> 19:08.033
And then when those guys
pounded the stuffing out of you,

19:08.033 --> 19:13.501
I thought, "Yeah, Canada's
pretty cool, too."

19:13.501 --> 19:16.100
I-I may have taken
a few pokes myself.

19:17.234 --> 19:19.567
So, I've decided,
dual citizenship.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.701
I'm going
to be American and Canadian.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.601
Wait, you can do that?

19:23.601 --> 19:24.868
Yeah, dummy.

19:24.868 --> 19:26.701
Instead of being a woman
with no country,

19:26.701 --> 19:28.868
I'm going to be
a woman with two.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.701
I see.

19:30.701 --> 19:32.067
You understand?

19:32.067 --> 19:35.467
No, I can see out
of my left eye again.

19:42.834 --> 19:45.033
Hey, baby?

19:45.033 --> 19:46.400
Baby?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.734
Hmm? Yeah?

19:47.734 --> 19:49.801
I'm so sorry
that we left you.

19:51.934 --> 19:54.133
Did you go somewhere, sweetie?

19:56.734 --> 19:59.567
<i>Yes, kids, it turns out
Crumpet Manor</i>

19:59.567 --> 20:02.968
<i>had pampered Lily into a nearly
comatose state of relaxation.</i>

20:02.968 --> 20:05.234
<i>She didn't even notice
we were gone.</i>

20:07.767 --> 20:10.367
Mmm....

20:11.934 --> 20:14.634
...

20:14.634 --> 20:15.701
Oh, oh, oh...

20:15.701 --> 20:18.200
Yeah...

20:18.200 --> 20:20.434
So, I had a great time, too.

20:20.434 --> 20:21.601
That's good.

20:21.601 --> 20:23.868
And I'm so sorry you
didn't get any pizza.

20:23.868 --> 20:25.200
Oh, that's okay.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.567
<i>And if she didn't mean it then,</i>

20:26.567 --> 20:29.100
<i>she certainly meant it
19 minutes later.</i>

20:29.100 --> 20:30.267
God, my stomach!

20:30.267 --> 20:33.467
Damn you, Gozzola's!

20:33.467 --> 20:36.400
It's like a hot ball of lead!

20:36.400 --> 20:38.200
Baby, cut it out of me.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.367
That was a wild
trip, huh, Ted?

20:44.367 --> 20:45.667
I know. It was
kind of crazy.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.934
But how great is it
to drink some Tantrum again?

20:47.934 --> 20:49.634
You know who had
fun, was Lily.

20:49.634 --> 20:51.834
Lily drank like, four
cans of the stuff.

20:51.834 --> 20:52.901
Right, Lil?

20:52.901 --> 20:55.367
Where's Lily?

20:55.367 --> 20:56.601
Tantrum!

20:56.601 --> 20:58.801
I have to pee.

20:58.802 --> 21:01.802
