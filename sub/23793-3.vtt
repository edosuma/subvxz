00:43.066 --> 00:43.300
WELL, TO

00:43.300 --> 00:44.133
"LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:44.133 --> 00:44.967
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.967 --> 00:46.033
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:46.033 --> 00:47.033
THE WEEK.

00:47.033 --> 00:47.867
AND WE BEGIN WITH THE TRUMP

00:47.867 --> 00:49.166
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS LIKE A

00:49.166 --> 00:56.266
CIRCUS IN THAT NOTHING ABOUT IT

00:56.266 --> 00:59.433
IS FUNNY AND I BADLY WANT IT TO

00:59.433 --> 01:00.033
END.

01:00.033 --> 01:00.734
THIS WEEK, EVEN BY CURRENT

01:00.734 --> 01:01.433
WHITE HOUSE STANDARDS, WAS SUCH

01:01.433 --> 01:02.567
A MESS WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME

01:02.567 --> 01:03.233
TO GET INTO MUELLER'S

01:03.233 --> 01:03.800
INVESTIGATION HEATING UP OR

01:03.800 --> 01:04.567
TRUMP FLIP-FLOPPING ON GUN

01:07.333 --> 01:08.500
MENTION THIS AMAZING DETAIL.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.734
>> "THE WASHINGTON POST"

01:09.734 --> 01:11.166
REPORTED THE PRESIDENT HAS

01:11.166 --> 01:12.100
REFERRED TO SESSIONS AS THE

01:12.100 --> 01:13.300
SHORT-SIGHTED ELDERLY CARTOON

01:13.300 --> 01:17.500
CHARACTER MR. MAGOO.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.266
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST, LEAVE

01:19.266 --> 01:21.000
IT TO TRUMP TO MOCK SESSIONS AS

01:21.000 --> 01:21.900
A DODDERING OLD MAN EVEN THOUGH

01:21.900 --> 01:23.100
TRUMP IS -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

01:23.100 --> 01:27.700
SIX MONTHS OLDER THAN HIM.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.100
AND CALLING HIM MR. MAGOO ISN'T

01:29.100 --> 01:34.734
JUST MEAN, IT'S LAZY.

01:34.734 --> 01:35.800
IF YOU WANT TO HURT SESSIONS,

01:35.800 --> 01:38.600
TRY.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.500
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.266
CALL HIM "CONFEDERATE SMURF" OR

01:42.266 --> 01:43.166
"A CASTING DIRECTOR'S

01:43.166 --> 01:43.867
SECOND-CHOICE FOR AN

01:43.867 --> 01:44.633

01:44.633 --> 01:45.367
OF A ONE-NIGHT STAND BETWEEN

01:45.367 --> 01:46.033
STROM THURMOND AND

01:46.033 --> 01:48.800
A GOLDEN RAISIN.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.834
AT LEAST MAKE AN EFFORT.

01:50.834 --> 01:51.467
MEANWHILE, THE ADMINISTRATION

01:51.467 --> 01:52.266
CONTINUES TO HEMORRHAGE

01:52.266 --> 01:53.033
STAFFERS, THE LATEST BEING

01:53.033 --> 01:53.900
HOPE HICKS, WHITE HOUSE

01:53.900 --> 01:54.734
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND

01:54.734 --> 01:56.066
"GIRL WHO STARTED THAT MEAN

01:56.066 --> 01:57.533
RUMOR ABOUT YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL."

01:57.533 --> 01:58.467
AND HICKS LEAVING IS A BIG DEAL

01:58.467 --> 01:59.867
FOR TRUMP.

01:59.867 --> 02:01.533
>> WITH HER GONE, THIS LEAVES A

02:01.533 --> 02:02.900
STUNNING LACK OF CONFIDANTES IN

02:02.900 --> 02:04.400
THE PRESIDENT'S INNER CIRCLE.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.500
DAN SCAVINO, THE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:05.500 --> 02:06.633
DIRECTOR HERE --

02:06.633 --> 02:07.900
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER

02:07.900 --> 02:08.967
GOLF CADDIE -- IS THE LAST MAN

02:08.967 --> 02:10.066
STANDING FROM THE ORIGINAL TEAM

02:10.066 --> 02:18.367
OF HIS CAMPAIGN.

02:18.367 --> 02:22.133
>> John: OKAY, SO LET'S ALL

02:22.133 --> 02:22.333
ADMIT,

02:22.333 --> 02:23.200
THAT'S A SUSPICIOUS PHOTO.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.367
BUT TO BE FAIR, WE LOOKED FOR

02:24.367 --> 02:25.033
NON-SUSPICIOUS PHOTOS OF

02:25.033 --> 02:26.166
DAN SCAVINO AND COULDN'T FIND

02:26.166 --> 02:26.633
ANY.

02:26.633 --> 02:27.867
THERE'S THIS ONE, "LOOKING AT

02:27.867 --> 02:29.367
PORN AT WORK" SUSPICIOUS.

02:29.367 --> 02:30.367
THIS ONE, "YOU DIDN'T SEE

02:30.367 --> 02:34.133
ANYTHING, AND IF YOU SAY A WORD,

02:34.133 --> 02:35.233
I'LL BREAK YOUR FUCKING NECK"

02:35.233 --> 02:35.767
SUSPICIOUS.

02:35.767 --> 02:36.834
AND MY FAVORITE, "OH, NO, I JUST

02:36.834 --> 02:40.500
REALIZED I LEFT MY CRAIGSLIST

02:40.500 --> 02:41.533
FRIEND IN THE PUNISHMENT

02:41.533 --> 02:42.400
BOX" SUSPICIOUS.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.166
HE'S A SUSPICIOUS GUY IS WHAT

02:43.166 --> 02:44.100
I'M SAYING.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.066
NOW, NOT EVERYONE HAS LEFT.

02:45.066 --> 02:46.166
THERE IS, OF COURSE, STILL

02:46.166 --> 02:47.800
JARED KUSHNER: AMERICA'S BUSIEST

02:47.800 --> 02:55.133
BUSINESS BOY.

02:55.133 --> 02:55.800
ALTHOUGH HE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE

02:55.800 --> 02:56.834
HAD THE WORST WEEK OF ALL,

02:56.834 --> 02:57.266
STARTING WITH THIS.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW

02:58.000 --> 02:58.867
AND SENIOR ADVISOR JARED KUSHNER

02:58.867 --> 03:00.000
NO LONGER HAS ACCESS TO TOP

03:00.000 --> 03:01.033
SECRET MATERIAL.

03:01.033 --> 03:02.233
KUSHNER'S CLEARANCE LEVEL WAS

03:02.233 --> 03:03.367
DOWNGRADED FROM TOP SECRET TO

03:03.367 --> 03:05.967
SECRET.

03:05.967 --> 03:06.867
>> EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE

03:06.867 --> 03:08.100
CALLIGRAPHER NOW HAS A HIGHER

03:08.100 --> 03:09.467
LEVEL OF CLEARANCE THAN KUSHNER

03:09.467 --> 03:12.834
NOW DOES.

03:12.834 --> 03:16.633
>> John: WOW!

03:16.633 --> 03:17.433
THAT IS HUMILIATING.

03:17.433 --> 03:18.133
ALTHOUGH IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE

03:18.133 --> 03:19.066
THAT A CALLIGRAPHER HAS TO BE

03:19.066 --> 03:24.533
GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS.

03:24.533 --> 03:27.033
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE TO KEEP A

03:27.033 --> 03:27.433
SECRET THAT

03:27.433 --> 03:29.667
THERE'S A FONT IN MICROSOFT WORD

03:29.667 --> 03:30.633
THAT DOES THEIR ENTIRE JOB.

03:30.633 --> 03:31.500
WHAT'S CRAZY IS, KUSHNER HAS

03:31.500 --> 03:32.266
REPORTEDLY BEEN ON INTERIM

03:32.266 --> 03:33.000
SECURITY CLEARANCE EVER SINCE HE

03:33.000 --> 03:33.834
JOINED THE WHITE HOUSE, AND

03:33.834 --> 03:34.867
THAT'S FOR PRETTY GOOD REASONS.

03:34.867 --> 03:35.934
>> JARED KUSHNER, IT'S NOT JUST

03:35.934 --> 03:37.133
HAS A COMPLICATED BUSINESS, HE

03:37.133 --> 03:38.433
HAD TO CHANGE HIS FEDERAL

03:38.433 --> 03:39.667
DISCLOSURE FORMS MULTIPLE TIMES

03:39.667 --> 03:42.300
BECAUSE HE "INADVERTENTLY

03:42.300 --> 03:44.266
OMITTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

03:44.266 --> 03:46.000
ASSETS AND FORGOT TO INCLUDE

03:46.000 --> 03:50.233
MORE THAN 100 FOREIGN CONTACTS."

03:50.233 --> 03:53.066
>> John: IN OTHER WORDS, KUSHNER

03:53.066 --> 03:54.166
SCREWED UP SOME IMPORTANT

03:54.166 --> 03:55.200
PAPERWORK, KEEPS CHANGING HIS

03:55.200 --> 03:56.166
PERSONAL WEALTH, AND CASUALLY

03:56.166 --> 03:57.500
OVERLOOKED HUNDREDS OF

03:57.500 --> 03:58.567
FOREIGNERS.

03:58.567 --> 03:59.867
HE TRULY IS HIS FATHER-IN-LAW'S

03:59.867 --> 04:01.000
SON.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.266
THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE IS, ONE

04:02.266 --> 04:03.567
OF THEM HAS ELECTRIFYING SEXUAL

04:03.567 --> 04:04.934
CHEMISTRY WITH IVANKA TRUMP AND

04:04.934 --> 04:11.767
THE OTHER IS JARED KUSHNER.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.200
NOW, JARED'S SECURITY ISSUE MAY

04:13.200 --> 04:15.100
AFFECT HIS ABILITY TO TAKE AN

04:15.100 --> 04:16.500
ACTIVE ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL

04:16.500 --> 04:17.567
RELATIONS -- ALTHOUGH, GOING BY

04:17.567 --> 04:18.600
ANOTHER STORY THAT CAME OUT THIS

04:18.600 --> 04:19.567
WEEK, THAT MAY NOT BE THE WORST

04:19.567 --> 04:21.066
THING.

04:21.066 --> 04:22.533
>> A REPORT IN

04:22.533 --> 04:24.033
"THE WASHINGTON POST" SUGGESTS

04:24.033 --> 04:25.033
OFFICIALS FROM CHINA, ISRAEL,

04:25.033 --> 04:26.433
MEXICO, AND THE

04:26.433 --> 04:29.633
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES SAW KUSHNER

04:29.633 --> 04:31.633
AS EXPLOITABLE AND AT ONE POINT

04:31.633 --> 04:33.066
HOPED TO MANIPULATE HIM.

04:33.066 --> 04:34.266
>> John: THE MOST SHOCKING THING

04:34.266 --> 04:35.233
ABOUT THAT IS IF SOMEHOW ONLY

04:35.233 --> 04:36.600
FOUR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THOUGHT

04:36.600 --> 04:38.567
THEY COULD MANIPULATE HIM.

04:38.567 --> 04:41.300
HOW IS IT NOT MORE THAN THAT?

04:41.300 --> 04:42.734
WHAT NATION LOOKED AT THIS MAN

04:42.734 --> 04:45.300
AND THOUGHT, "FORGET IT,

04:45.300 --> 04:48.200
HIS MIND IS A FORTRESS"?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.533
HOW DID BOLIVIA, LAOS, OR

04:49.533 --> 04:51.266
GERMANY NOT FEEL THAT THIS WAS A

04:51.266 --> 04:53.533
CRACKABLE NUT?

04:53.533 --> 04:54.934
COME ON, FRANCE, ICELAND,

04:54.934 --> 04:56.133
YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS EVEN

04:56.133 --> 04:57.400
WORTH TRYING A LITTLE

04:57.400 --> 04:59.800
NUDGE-NUDGE ON THE

04:59.800 --> 05:03.200
OLD KUSH

05:03.200 --> 05:04.033
AND, LOOK, IT'S EASY TO GET

05:04.033 --> 05:05.000
CAUGHT UP IN ALL THE DRAMA AND

05:05.000 --> 05:05.867
FORGET THAT WHITE HOUSE CHAOS

05:05.867 --> 05:06.734
CAN HAVE REAL-WORLD

05:06.734 --> 05:07.734
CONSEQUENCES, BUT THURSDAY

05:07.734 --> 05:08.800
BROUGHT A REMINDER OF THAT WHEN,

05:08.800 --> 05:09.567
UNEXPECTEDLY, TRUMP ANNOUNCED

05:09.567 --> 05:10.700
NEW TARIFFS ON STEEL AND

05:10.700 --> 05:12.100
ALUMINUM.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.200
AND WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THAT

05:13.200 --> 05:14.300
MOVE OR NOT, YOU HAVE TO BE

05:14.300 --> 05:16.867
BOTHERED BY HOW IT HAPPENED.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.400
>> SPOILING FOR A FIGHT, ANY

05:18.400 --> 05:20.033
FIGHT, THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO

05:20.033 --> 05:21.700
PICK ONE ON TRADE, ANNOUNCING

05:21.700 --> 05:23.567
NEW TARIFFS AGAINST THE ADVICE

05:23.567 --> 05:25.000
OF MANY OF HIS TOP ADVISERS AND

05:25.000 --> 05:28.333
WITHOUT ANY INTERNAL REVIEW,

05:28.333 --> 05:29.700
TWEETING, "TRADE WARS ARE GOOD

05:29.700 --> 05:32.633
AND EASY TO WIN."

05:32.633 --> 05:34.533
>> John: YES, TRADE WARS ARE

05:34.533 --> 05:36.633
GOOD AND EASY TO WIN, WHICH IS

05:36.633 --> 05:38.033
WEIRD, BECAUSE IF THAT WAS TRUE,

05:38.033 --> 05:39.600
EVERYONE WOULD ALWAYS WIN THEM,

05:39.600 --> 05:40.967
IN WHICH CASE THEY'D ACTUALLY BE

05:40.967 --> 05:44.500
HARD TO WIN, BECAUSE EVERYONE

05:44.500 --> 05:45.066
ELSE WOULD ALREADY HAVE WON

05:45.066 --> 05:46.033
THEM.

05:46.033 --> 05:47.600
IT'S A COMPLEX SITUATION

05:47.600 --> 05:49.333
THAT PHILOSOPHERS REFER TO AS

05:49.333 --> 05:51.066
"THE DIPSHIT'S CONUNDRUM."

05:51.066 --> 05:57.900
NOW, SOME WERE IMMEDIATELY

05:57.900 --> 05:58.367
SIGNIFICANTLY ALARMED

05:58.367 --> 05:59.667
THAT THIS COULD ACTUALLY

05:59.667 --> 06:00.333
RAISE THE COST FOR AMERICANS ON

06:00.333 --> 06:00.967
ANYTHING CONTAINING ALUMINUM OR

06:00.967 --> 06:02.000
STEEL.

06:02.000 --> 06:02.734
THAT'S WHY TRUMP SENT OUT HIS

06:02.734 --> 06:03.900
DYNAMIC SECRETARY OF COMMERCE,

06:03.900 --> 06:04.467
WILBUR ROSS, TO ALLAY THOSE

06:04.467 --> 06:05.266
FEARS IN THE DUMBEST WAY

06:05.266 --> 06:06.667
POSSIBLE.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.900
>> WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO,

06:08.900 --> 06:10.800
THOUGH, IS TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN

06:10.800 --> 06:13.367
THE LIMITED IMPACT.

06:13.367 --> 06:14.967
THIS IS A CAN OF CAMPBELL'S

06:14.967 --> 06:17.100
SOUP.

06:17.100 --> 06:22.033
IN THE CAN OF CAMPBELL'S SOUP,

06:22.033 --> 06:24.100
THERE'S ABOUT 2.6 CENTS,

06:24.100 --> 06:26.567
2.6 PENNIES WORTH OF STEEL.

06:26.567 --> 06:29.767
SO IF THAT GOES UP BY 25%,

06:29.767 --> 06:31.967
THAT'S ABOUT 6/10 OF ONE CENT ON

06:31.967 --> 06:32.834
THE PRICE OF A CAN OF CAMPBELL'S

06:32.834 --> 06:37.400
SOUP.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.567
>> John: GREAT POINT, WILBUR.

06:40.567 --> 06:45.233
AND AS LONG AS THERE ISN'T

06:45.233 --> 06:46.834
ANYTHING IN THE ECONOMY

06:46.834 --> 06:47.567
THAT ISN'T SOUP, WE

06:47.567 --> 06:48.500
SHOULD BE JUST FINE.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.400
BUT DON'T WORRY.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.367
OUR RESEARCHERS HAVE ACTUALLY

06:50.367 --> 06:51.600
LOOKING INTO IT, AND IT TURNS

06:51.600 --> 06:52.900
OUT, EVERYTHING IS SOUP.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.300
SO WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.200
OH, AND ONE MORE THING:

06:57.200 --> 06:59.100
ONE MORE QUICK THING HERE.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.867
HOW IS HE NOT MAGOO?

07:01.867 --> 07:04.367
THAT IS THE MAGOO-IEST SHIT I'VE

07:04.367 --> 07:05.400
EVER SEEN RIGHT THERE.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.567
AND IN DOING THIS, TRUMP MAY

07:06.567 --> 07:07.633
WELL HAVE SET OFF A GLOBAL TRADE

07:07.633 --> 07:08.967
WAR FOR NO GOOD REASON.

07:08.967 --> 07:11.600
AND IF YOU NEED A SENSE OF JUST

07:11.600 --> 07:12.500
HOW STUPID THIS MOVE IS, JUST

07:12.500 --> 07:13.667
WATCH THE RESPONSE FROM E.U.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.900
PRESIDENT JEAN CLAUDE JUNCKER,

07:15.900 --> 07:16.834
WHO CANNOT BELIEVE HE IS NOW

07:16.834 --> 07:18.333
BEING FORCED TO ENGAGE IN THIS

07:18.333 --> 07:20.567
SHIT.

07:20.567 --> 07:21.700
>> SO NOW WE WILL ALSO IMPOSE

07:21.700 --> 07:23.400
IMPORT TARIFFS.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.567
THIS IS BASICALLY A STUPID

07:24.567 --> 07:25.734
PROCESS, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

07:25.734 --> 07:26.900
TO DO THIS, BUT WE HAVE TO DO

07:26.900 --> 07:28.033
IT.

07:28.033 --> 07:29.567
WE WILL NOW IMPOSE TARIFFS ON

07:29.567 --> 07:32.033
MOTORCYCLES, HARLEY DAVIDSON, ON

07:32.033 --> 07:33.967
BLUE JEANS, LEVIS, ON BOURBON.

07:33.967 --> 07:36.266
WE CAN ALSO DO STUPID.

07:36.266 --> 07:40.266
WE ALSO HAVE TO BE THIS STUPID.

07:40.266 --> 07:41.767
>> John: OH, REALLY, JUNCKER?

07:41.767 --> 07:43.233
YOU THINK YOU CAN BE AS STUPID

07:43.233 --> 07:44.367
AS US?

07:44.367 --> 07:45.734
PLEASE.

07:45.734 --> 07:48.266
YOU JUST BROUGHT A KNIFE TO A

07:48.266 --> 07:50.633
GUN FIGHT, AND WE JUST BROUGHT A

07:50.633 --> 07:52.467
HOT POCKET THAT WE PUT IN OUR

07:52.467 --> 07:54.433
GUN HOLSTER AND FORGOT WAS

07:54.433 --> 07:54.633
THERE.

07:54.633 --> 07:55.934
BECAUSE NO ONE OUT-STUPIDS

07:55.934 --> 08:01.200
DONALD TRUMP'S U.S. OF A!

08:01.200 --> 08:03.367
NOBODY!

08:03.367 --> 08:03.600
NOBODY!

08:03.600 --> 08:04.633
YOU DON'T KNOW US!

08:04.633 --> 08:07.900
AND NOW THIS.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.734
>> AND NOW, WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE

08:10.734 --> 08:11.233
ON THE MAURY SHOW?

08:11.233 --> 08:13.166
>> ARE YOU A MISTRESS WHO IS IN

08:13.166 --> 08:14.166
LOVE WITH A MARRIED MAN AND

08:14.166 --> 08:17.300
WANTS HIM TO CHOOSE FOR ONCE AND

08:17.300 --> 08:19.834
FOR ALL, IF SO, CALL.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.600
>> DO YOU SUSPECT HE IS USING

08:21.600 --> 08:23.000
YOU FOR YOUR MONEY AND A PLACE

08:23.000 --> 08:23.934
TO LIVE?

08:23.934 --> 08:24.867
ARE YOU DOING A MUCH YOUNGER MAN

08:24.867 --> 08:26.934
I DO SUSPECT HE IS CHEATING ON

08:26.934 --> 08:27.100
YOU?

08:27.100 --> 08:30.333
>> IS YOUR FATHER DATING A MUCH

08:30.333 --> 08:30.667
YOUNGER WOMAN?

08:30.667 --> 08:31.700
>> ARGUMENTS HER DAUGHTER'S

08:31.700 --> 08:33.100
BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND IS CHEATING

08:33.100 --> 08:33.333
ON HER?

08:33.333 --> 08:35.200
>> ARE YOU CONVINCED HER MOTHER

08:35.200 --> 08:39.066
IS HAVING SEX WITH YOUR HUSBAND?

08:39.066 --> 08:41.233
>> IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF TWO

08:41.233 --> 08:43.433
OR MORE MEN BEING THE FATHER OF

08:43.433 --> 08:43.734
YOUR CHILD?

08:43.734 --> 08:47.867
>> IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT F

08:47.867 --> 08:48.567
YOUR CHILD?

08:48.567 --> 08:50.767
>> ARE YOU 18 YEARS OR OLDER AND

08:50.767 --> 08:53.533
THE MAN YOU THINK IS YOUR FATHER

08:53.533 --> 08:53.934
CLAIMS HE IS NOT?

08:53.934 --> 08:55.900
>> DOES YOUR CHILD LOOK LIKE

08:55.900 --> 08:56.867
THEY BELONG TO ANOTHER RACE?

08:56.867 --> 08:59.900
>> DID ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND

08:59.900 --> 09:00.667
GET YOU PREGNANT?

09:00.667 --> 09:02.567
>> ARE YOU A GRANDMOTHER WHO

09:02.567 --> 09:03.834
LOVES WEARING REVEALING CLOTHING

09:03.834 --> 09:07.000
AND IT IS DRIVING YOUR FAMILY

09:07.000 --> 09:08.100
CRAZY?

09:08.100 --> 09:09.333
>> John: OUR MAIN STORY

09:09.333 --> 09:13.166
TONIGHT CONCERNS THE NRA.

09:13.166 --> 09:13.967
A GROUP THAT FEELS

09:13.967 --> 09:14.667
ABOUT GUNS THE WAY THE REST OF

09:14.667 --> 09:15.367
US FEEL ABOUT NUTELLA:

09:15.367 --> 09:16.166
A LITTLE IS GOOD.

09:16.166 --> 09:16.867
MORE IS BETTER.

09:16.867 --> 09:18.233
AND YOU CAN TELL ME IT'S BAD FOR

09:18.233 --> 09:18.934
ME ALL YOU LIKE, BUT YOU CAN PRY

09:18.934 --> 09:20.400
IT FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.400
IN THE WAKE OF THE PARKLAND

09:21.400 --> 09:22.400
SHOOTING, THE NRA HAS FOUND

09:22.400 --> 09:23.133
THEMSELVES IN THE SPOTLIGHT ONCE

09:23.133 --> 09:24.266
MORE.

09:24.266 --> 09:29.100
HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC PRESSURE

09:29.100 --> 09:31.867
THIS TIME IS ACTUALLY STARTING

09:31.867 --> 09:32.233
TO TAKE A TOLL.

09:32.233 --> 09:32.900
>> TWITTER USERS ARE PRESSURING

09:32.900 --> 09:33.633
COMPANIES AFFILIATED WITH THE

09:33.633 --> 09:34.533
GUN RIGHTS GROUP BY USING THE

09:34.533 --> 09:35.500
HASHTAG #BoycottNRA.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.734
>> SO 15 COMPANIES HAVE CUT TIES

09:38.734 --> 09:39.633
WITH THE NRA AFTER PARKLAND.

09:39.633 --> 09:40.367
I THINK WE HAVE A LIST OF THEM

09:40.367 --> 09:41.066
HERE, SOME BIG ONES.

09:41.066 --> 09:42.500
DELTA, UNITED, AVIS, BUDGET,

09:42.500 --> 09:45.667
HERTZ.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.300
BASICALLY SAYING THERE ARE NO

09:47.300 --> 09:47.800
LONGER GOING TO PROVIDE

09:47.800 --> 09:49.367
DISCOUNTS TO THE NRA.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.367
>> John: YES, AVIS, BUDGET, AND

09:50.367 --> 09:52.467
HERTZ WILL ALL STOP PROVIDING

09:52.467 --> 09:55.667
DISCOUNTS TO NRA MEMBERS, WHICH

09:55.667 --> 09:58.100
WILL PRESUMABLY COME AS A HUGE

09:58.100 --> 09:58.266
BLOW

09:58.266 --> 10:00.100
TO JEREMY, THE ONE NRA MEMBER

10:00.100 --> 10:02.400
WHO WAS JUST IN IT FOR THE

10:02.400 --> 10:03.367
RENTAL CARS.

10:03.367 --> 10:04.133
BUT THE BOYCOTT TRAIN HIT A SNAG

10:04.133 --> 10:04.867
WHEN IT RAN INTO ONE OF THE

10:04.867 --> 10:05.734
NRA'S LESSER-KNOWN SIDE

10:05.734 --> 10:06.700
VENTURES.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.033
>> ONE GROUP THAT HAS NOT BEEN

10:09.033 --> 10:10.166
SWAYED YET, BIG TECH COMPANIES

10:10.166 --> 10:14.266
LIKE APPLE, AMAZON, AND ROKU.

10:14.266 --> 10:15.567
YOU SEE, THESE COMPANIES'

10:15.567 --> 10:16.200
STREAMING SERVICES STILL OFFER

10:16.200 --> 10:17.133
ACCESS TO NRATV, THE GUN LOBBY

10:17.133 --> 10:18.934
GROUP'S FREE ONLINE CHANNEL

10:18.934 --> 10:22.834
FOCUSED ON PRO-GUN CONTENT.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.100
>> John: OKAY, SO THAT IS AN

10:24.100 --> 10:24.767
UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION FOR

10:24.767 --> 10:26.433
APPLE AND AMAZON, BUT IT'S A

10:26.433 --> 10:27.033
FUCKING MIRACLE FOR ROKU.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.033
"HARRY!

10:28.033 --> 10:31.834
HARRY, GET IN HERE!

10:31.834 --> 10:32.767
SOMEONE JUST CALLED US A

10:32.767 --> 10:33.867
'BIG TECH COMPANY.'

10:33.867 --> 10:34.667
THEY SAID 'LIKE AMAZON AND

10:34.667 --> 10:35.633
APPLE.'

10:35.633 --> 10:37.033
IT'S HAPPENING, HARRY!

10:37.033 --> 10:40.266
IT'S HAPPENING!"

10:40.266 --> 10:43.166
BUT WITH ALL THE DISCUSSION THIS

10:43.166 --> 10:44.367
WEEK OF BOYCOTTING NRATV, WE

10:44.367 --> 10:46.133
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE WORTH

10:46.133 --> 10:47.333
ANSWERING THE QUESTION,

10:47.333 --> 10:52.233
"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?"

10:52.233 --> 10:53.133
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, YOU MAY'VE

10:53.133 --> 10:53.767
ACTUALLY SEEN TINY BITS OF ITS

10:53.767 --> 10:54.533
PROGRAMMING WITHOUT REALIZING

10:54.533 --> 10:55.500
IT.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.367
LIKE WHEN THIS VIDEO FEATURING

10:56.367 --> 10:58.300
NRA SPOKESPERSON DANA LOESCH

10:58.300 --> 10:59.200
WENT VIRAL JUST LAST YEAR.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.233
>> THEY USE THEIR MEDIA TO

11:00.233 --> 11:01.900
ASSASSINATE REAL NEWS.

11:01.900 --> 11:06.166
THEY USE THEIR SCHOOLS TO TEACH

11:06.166 --> 11:06.934
CHILDREN THAT THEIR PRESIDENT IS

11:06.934 --> 11:07.667
ANOTHER HITLER.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.767
THE ONLY WAY WE STOP THIS, THE

11:08.767 --> 11:10.300
ONLY WAY WE SAVE OUR COUNTRY AND

11:10.300 --> 11:12.133
OUR FREEDOM, IS TO FIGHT THIS

11:12.133 --> 11:14.600
VIOLENCE OF LIES WITH A CLENCHED

11:14.600 --> 11:18.200
FIST OF TRUTH.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.333
>> John: YES, THE "CLENCHED FIST

11:19.333 --> 11:20.900
OF TRUTH," WHICH, IF YOU'RE

11:20.900 --> 11:23.567
LOOKING FOR IT, IS JUST A LITTLE

11:23.567 --> 11:24.834
PAST THE BENT ELBOW OF NONSENSE

11:24.834 --> 11:26.166
AND HIDING IN THE OVERSTUFFED

11:26.166 --> 11:27.266
POCKET OF NEEDLESSLY AGGRESSIVE

11:27.266 --> 11:29.000
METAPHORS.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.467
IF YOU MISSED THAT, YOU MAY'VE

11:30.467 --> 11:32.567
SEEN ONE THAT MADE THE ROUNDS

11:32.567 --> 11:34.233
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

11:34.233 --> 11:35.433
FEATURING COUNTRY MUSIC LEGEND

11:35.433 --> 11:36.800
CHARLIE DANIELS.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.333
>> TO THE AYATOLLAHS OF IRAN AND

11:39.333 --> 11:41.500
EVERY TERRORIST YOU ENABLE,

11:41.500 --> 11:42.800
LISTEN UP: YOU MIGHT HAVE MET

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
OUR FRESH-FACED FLOWER CHILD

11:44.800 --> 11:46.667
PRESIDENT AND HIS WEAK-KNEED

11:46.667 --> 11:48.000
IVY-LEAGUE FRIENDS, BUT YOU

11:48.000 --> 11:50.567
HAVEN'T MET AMERICA.

11:50.567 --> 11:55.166
YOU HAVEN'T MET THE HEARTLAND,

11:55.166 --> 11:56.667
WHERE THE PEOPLE WOULD DEFEND

11:56.667 --> 11:57.800
THIS NATION WITH THEIR BLOODY,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.300
CALLOUSED, BARE HANDS.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.333
YOU HAVEN'T MET THE

12:00.333 --> 12:01.467
STEEL WORKERS AND THE

12:01.467 --> 12:03.000
HARD ROCK MINERS

12:03.000 --> 12:03.600
OR THE SWAMP FOLKS IN

12:03.600 --> 12:04.700
CAJUN COUNTRY WHO CAN WRESTLE A

12:04.700 --> 12:05.567
FULL-GROWN GATOR OUT OF THE

12:05.567 --> 12:07.834
WATER.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.166
>> John: "YOU HAVEN'T MET THE

HILL DEMONS WHO CAN CURSE YOU

12:10.367 --> 12:11.600
AND YOUR FUTURE OFFSPRING JUST

12:11.600 --> 12:12.767
FOR HAVING A PICNIC IN THE WRONG

12:12.767 --> 12:13.934
PLACE.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.400
YOU HAVEN'T MET THE LAKE DOG.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.967
HE'S A DOG WHO LIVES IN A LAKE

12:16.967 --> 12:18.467
FOR REASONS TOO COMPLICATED TO

12:18.467 --> 12:20.100
GET INTO AT THE PRESENT MOMENT.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.100
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN MET THE

GATORS DOWN IN CAJUN COUNTRY

12:23.467 --> 12:25.300
WHO TIPTOE OUT OF THE WATER AT

12:25.300 --> 12:26.533
NIGHT AND TAKE REVENGE ON THE

12:26.533 --> 12:27.834
SWAMP FOLK WHILE THEY SLEEP,

12:27.834 --> 12:29.433
THUS PERPETUATING THE SICK CYCLE

12:29.433 --> 12:32.567
OF SWAMP FOLK-GATOR VIOLENCE.

12:32.567 --> 12:33.667
THAT'S THE AMERICA I KNOW.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.100
AND I PROMISE YOU, YOU'RE GOING

12:35.100 --> 12:39.000
TO BE CONFUSED BY IT."

12:39.000 --> 12:41.100
IN FACT, RECENTLY, ANOTHER ONE

12:41.100 --> 12:42.467
OF THEIR PROMOS WAS PASSED

12:42.467 --> 12:43.700
AROUND ONLINE, AND YOU MAY

12:43.700 --> 12:44.800
RECOGNIZE ONE OF THE FACES IN

12:44.800 --> 12:46.266
IT.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.166

13:26.166 --> 13:26.900
HE'S RIGHT.

13:26.900 --> 13:27.600
AND IF NRA MEMBERS ARE ANNOYED

13:27.600 --> 13:28.233
WITH WHAT I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW,

13:28.233 --> 13:29.000
THEY SHOULD DO THE EXACT SAME

13:29.000 --> 13:29.967
THING AND SMASH THEIR EXPENSIVE

13:29.967 --> 13:30.600
TELEVISIONS WITH LARGE

13:30.600 --> 13:31.367
SLEDGEHAMMERS.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.800
ARE YOU LISTENING, NRA MEMBERS?

13:32.800 --> 13:36.467
DESTROY YOUR OWN PROPERTY.

13:36.467 --> 13:40.967
IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA, AND

13:40.967 --> 13:41.600
IT'S HONESTLY THE ONLY WAY WE'LL

13:41.600 --> 13:42.433
LEARN.

13:42.433 --> 13:43.133
NRATV PRODUCES A LOT OF VIDEOS

13:43.133 --> 13:43.867
LIKE THOSE THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY

13:43.867 --> 13:44.700
JUST TROLLING FOR YOUR

13:44.700 --> 13:45.667
ATTENTION.

13:45.667 --> 13:46.567
BUT THEIR CONTENT GOES MUCH,

13:46.567 --> 13:48.000
MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT,

13:48.000 --> 13:48.767
AS YOU'LL SEE IF YOU GO TO THEIR

13:48.767 --> 13:51.266
WEBSITE OR WATCH IT ON

13:51.266 --> 13:53.200
STREAMING DEVICES LIKE

13:53.200 --> 13:56.100
THE GREAT AND POWERFUL ROKU --

13:56.100 --> 13:57.200
"THEY SAID IT AGAIN, HARRY!

13:57.200 --> 13:59.700
THEY SAID OUR NAME!

14:06.533 --> 14:07.700
NRATV HAS NEWS PROGRAMMING,

14:07.700 --> 14:08.667
AND THERE'S HONESTLY NOT MUCH

14:08.667 --> 14:09.567
POINT IN OUR SHOWING YOU ANY OF

14:09.567 --> 14:10.400
IT, BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIALLY

14:10.400 --> 14:11.166
JUST FOX NEWS ON A MUCH LOWER

14:11.166 --> 14:14.033
BUDGET.

14:14.033 --> 14:16.066
WHAT IS MORE SURPRISING IS,

14:16.066 --> 14:16.834
THEY MAKE SHOWS,

14:16.834 --> 14:19.467
LOTS AND LOTS OF SHOWS.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.500
AND THEY ARE SO MUCH STRANGER

14:20.500 --> 14:21.233
THAN YOU'D THINK.

14:21.233 --> 14:21.934
SO TONIGHT, LET'S WATCH SOME

14:21.934 --> 14:24.700
NRATV TOGETHER.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.000
BECAUSE IT'S FASCINATING.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.934
NOW, SOME SHOWS ARE PRETTY

14:26.934 --> 14:27.467
SIMILAR TO ONES YOU'D SEE

14:27.467 --> 14:30.233
ANYWHERE ON TV, WITH THE KEY

14:30.233 --> 14:30.967
DIFFERENCE THAT THERE IS A GUN

14:31.834 --> 14:32.700
FOR INSTANCE, THEY HAVE THREE

14:32.700 --> 14:33.600
DIFFERENT "ANTIQUES ROADSHOW"

14:33.600 --> 14:36.133
KNOCKOFFS IN WHICH MEN WHO LOOK

14:36.133 --> 14:38.000
LIKE THIS GUY GET PROGRESSIVELY

14:38.000 --> 14:39.700
MORE AND MORE AROUSED BY THE

14:39.700 --> 14:40.533
GUNS THEY'RE HOLDING.

14:40.533 --> 14:41.633
>> WHAT'S UNIQUE IS THAT IT HAS

14:41.633 --> 14:42.834
SUCH FLOWING LINES.

14:42.834 --> 14:44.700
IT'S ARTWORK.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.700
IT'S A SENSUOUS GUN.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.467
THAT'S THE KIND OF PISTOL THAT

14:48.467 --> 14:50.066
WHEN I HOLD OR WHEN JOHN IS

14:50.066 --> 14:53.033
HOLDING, IT GIVES ME SHIVERS.

14:53.033 --> 14:56.033
THE IDEA WAS IS THAT YOU

14:56.033 --> 14:57.333
WOULD COCK BOTH HAMMERS AT THE

14:57.333 --> 14:58.767
SAME TIME.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.467
>> John: THAT MAN IS

15:00.467 --> 15:01.133
DOUG WICKLUND, AND I LOVE HIM,

15:01.133 --> 15:02.734
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS HE LOVES

15:02.734 --> 15:04.667
GUNS.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.667
IN FACT, THE ONLY WAY HE COULD

15:06.667 --> 15:08.166
LOVE THEM ANY MORE IS IF,

15:08.166 --> 15:09.900
INSTEAD OF BULLETS, EVERY GUN

15:09.900 --> 15:15.867
JUST FIRED A BUNCH OF LITTLE

15:15.867 --> 15:22.567
BUNCH OF EVEN SMALLER GUNS

15:22.567 --> 15:23.433
WHICH, IN TURN, FIRED TINY

15:23.433 --> 15:24.133
DOUG WICKLUNDS LIVING

15:24.133 --> 15:24.767
IN A STATE OF SEXUAL ECSTASY

15:24.767 --> 15:26.200
INSIDE THE WOMB-LIKE PARADISE OF

15:26.200 --> 15:26.467
A FIREARM.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.066
AND WHILE THAT SHOW IS PRETTY

15:27.066 --> 15:27.700
SEDATE, NRATV ALSO HAS

15:27.700 --> 15:28.433
PROGRAMMING FOR THE

15:28.433 --> 15:29.233
TESTOSTERONE-FUELED GUN

15:29.233 --> 15:29.967
ENTHUSIAST, LIKE "MEDIA LAB," IN

15:29.967 --> 15:30.934
WHICH A FORMER NAVY SEAL NAMED

15:30.934 --> 15:31.934
DOM RASO DOES THE VERY IMPORTANT

15:31.934 --> 15:32.800
WORK OF REENACTING MOVIES HE

15:32.800 --> 15:33.967
LIKES, FROM "WHITE HOUSE DOWN"

15:33.967 --> 15:39.600
TO "JACK REACHER."

15:39.600 --> 15:40.333
AND HERE HE IS RE-ENACTING

15:40.333 --> 15:41.533
SCENES FROM THE MOVIE "HEAT."

15:41.533 --> 15:42.433
>> THE MAIN PART OF THIS MOVIE

15:42.433 --> 15:43.266
THAT I WANTED TO BREAK DOWN WAS

15:43.266 --> 15:43.967
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE SHOOTING,

15:43.967 --> 15:44.900
MOVING, AND COMMUNICATING, AND

15:44.900 --> 15:45.734
IF WE GET PAST THE FACT THAT

15:45.734 --> 15:47.100
THEY'RE ROBBING A BANK, IF

15:47.100 --> 15:48.600
YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN A SPECIFIC

15:48.600 --> 15:50.667
UNIFORM WITH SPECIFIC KIT, CAN

15:50.667 --> 15:51.433
YOU SHOOT, MOVE, COMMUNICATE

15:51.433 --> 15:55.266
WITH THAT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND

15:55.266 --> 15:56.100
DO DOWN

15:56.100 --> 15:57.333
THAT'S THE KEY THING HERE.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.533
>> John: I'D LOVE TO SEE A BANK

15:58.533 --> 15:59.467
ROBBER TRY TO USE THAT DEFENSE

15:59.467 --> 16:01.767
IN COURT.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.667
"YOUR HONOR, I REALLY FEEL WE

16:03.667 --> 16:05.066
NEED TO GET PAST THE FACT THAT

16:05.066 --> 16:06.934
WE WERE ROBBING A BANK, AND

16:06.934 --> 16:08.500
INSTEAD FOCUS ON HOW WELL WE

16:08.500 --> 16:09.066
WERE SHOOTING, MOVING, AND

16:09.066 --> 16:09.767
COMMUNICATING."

16:09.767 --> 16:10.967
AND THE ENDEARING THING ABOUT

16:10.967 --> 16:11.533
DOM RASO IS THAT HIS SHOW'S

16:11.533 --> 16:12.133
RE-ENACTMENTS DON'T ALWAYS GO

16:12.133 --> 16:12.800
SMOOTHLY.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.567
FOR INSTANCE, HOW DID HIS

16:13.567 --> 16:14.700
RE-ENACTMENT OF THE "HEAT"

16:14.700 --> 16:15.834
ROBBERY GO?

16:15.834 --> 16:16.667
>> THEY MAKE IT LOOK EASY, THE

16:16.667 --> 16:17.800
WAY THEY'RE MOVING.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.166
>> YEAH, THIS BAG, AS I WAS

16:19.166 --> 16:20.567
RUNNING, WAS JUST HITTING AT THE

16:20.567 --> 16:21.500
BACK OF MY KNEES, HAVE TAKEN MY

16:21.500 --> 16:22.400
LEGS OUT FROM UNDERNEATH ME.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.667
DEFINITELY FATIGUED ME.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.066
>> MY STRAP BROKE.

16:25.066 --> 16:26.300
SO I WAS HOLDING IT LIKE THIS

16:26.300 --> 16:27.467
THE ENTIRE TIME, WOBBLING BACK

16:27.467 --> 16:28.300
AND FORTH, EVEN IN THE

16:28.300 --> 16:29.233
BEGINNING.

16:29.233 --> 16:30.433
COULDN'T GET A STABLE SHOOTING

16:30.433 --> 16:30.867
PLATFORM.

16:30.867 --> 16:31.800
I MEAN, WE WORKED IT OUT.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
I HAD TO LOWER MY CENTER OF

16:32.800 --> 16:33.767
GRAVITY MORE SO THE BAG COULDN'T

16:33.767 --> 16:35.166
CONTROL ME.

16:35.166 --> 16:35.967
WE DEFINITELY PROVED THAT THEY

16:35.967 --> 16:36.700
DIDN'T HAVE ANY WEIGHT IN THERE

16:36.700 --> 16:38.033
WHILE THEY WERE SHOOTING AND

16:38.033 --> 16:39.200
MOVING.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.300
>> John: WOW.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.300
THAT IS GENUINELY INSPIRING.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.533
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE OUT THERE,

16:45.533 --> 16:46.467
THERE'S AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD

16:46.467 --> 16:47.233
ASSHOLE WATCHING

16:47.233 --> 16:48.133
THAT SHOW AND THINKING,

16:48.133 --> 16:48.800
"OH, GOOD, BEING AN ADULT IS

16:48.800 --> 16:49.633
LITERALLY EXACTLY HOW I IMAGINED

16:49.633 --> 16:50.533
IT."

16:50.533 --> 16:51.400
HONESTLY, I COULD TALK ABOUT

16:51.400 --> 16:53.033
DOM RASO ALL NIGHT, BUT BEFORE

16:53.033 --> 16:54.266
WE MOVE ON, I HAVE TO SHOW YOU

16:54.266 --> 16:56.900
HIS INEXPLICABLE RESPONSE TO A

16:56.900 --> 16:59.834
VIEWER-SUBMITTED QUESTION.

16:59.834 --> 17:00.967
>> WHAT IS YOUR MOST TREASURED

17:00.967 --> 17:02.800
POSSESSION?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.734
>> I WOULD SAY, MY AUNT GAVE ME

17:04.734 --> 17:05.600
A CROSS THAT WAS MADE OUT OF

17:05.600 --> 17:07.000
BONES.

17:07.000 --> 17:07.967
SHE'S LIKE, YOUR

17:07.967 --> 17:09.367
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER GAVE

17:09.367 --> 17:10.700
THAT TO ME TO PASS DOWN TO

17:10.700 --> 17:12.233
SOMEBODY SPECIAL IN THE FAMILY,

17:12.233 --> 17:13.233
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY MADE OUT OF

17:13.233 --> 17:14.567
HUMAN BONE AND HE CARVED IT WHEN

17:14.567 --> 17:15.767
HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR AND

17:15.767 --> 17:16.834
THAT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN IN THE

17:16.834 --> 17:18.200
FAMILY.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.567
NOW I'M LIKE, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:19.567 --> 17:20.867
I'M LIKE, THAT JUST DOESN'T

17:20.867 --> 17:21.100
EXIST.

17:21.100 --> 17:21.934
SO THAT'S PROBABLY BY FAR THE

17:21.934 --> 17:25.300
COOLEST THING THAT I HAVE.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.967
>> John: WELL, THAT'S A HELL OF

17:28.967 --> 17:29.900
A STORY THERE, DOM.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.166
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW OF ANY

17:31.166 --> 17:31.767
BETTER POSTER BOY FOR THE NRA

17:31.767 --> 17:32.834
THAN SOMEONE WHO RE-ENACTS BANK

17:32.834 --> 17:33.633
ROBBERIES FOR FUN AND WHOSE MOST

17:33.633 --> 17:34.533
TREASURED POSSESSION IS A CROSS

17:34.533 --> 17:40.200
MADE OUT OF HUMAN BONES.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.000
BUT, LOOK, NRATV ISN'T ALL GUN

17:41.000 --> 17:41.934
BROS.

17:41.934 --> 17:42.834
THERE'S ALSO A LARGE AMOUNT OF

17:42.834 --> 17:43.667
CONTENT EXPLICITLY AIMED AT

17:43.667 --> 17:44.367
WOMEN.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.400
THERE'S EVEN A WHOLE WOMEN'S

17:45.400 --> 17:46.400
CHANNEL FEATURING SHOWS LIKE

17:46.400 --> 17:49.667
"ARMED AND FABULOUS."

17:49.667 --> 17:51.700
THE NRA IS ACTUALLY MAKING A BIG

17:51.700 --> 17:53.200
PUSH FOR WOMEN, AND THEY'RE

17:53.200 --> 17:53.934
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THEIR

17:53.934 --> 17:54.934
MOTIVATIONS.

17:54.934 --> 17:55.834
>> WOMEN REALLY HAVE AN

17:55.834 --> 17:56.700
INCREDIBLE ROLE RIGHT NOW IN THE

17:56.700 --> 18:00.633
NRA.

18:00.633 --> 18:02.033
THEY ARE EXCITED.

18:02.033 --> 18:02.967
THEY ARE ENTHUSIASTIC.

18:02.967 --> 18:03.500
THEY ARE THERE FOR US AND

18:03.500 --> 18:04.133
THAT'S --

18:04.133 --> 18:05.000
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET THE

18:05.000 --> 18:06.166
WOMAN, YOU GET THE FAMILY.

18:06.166 --> 18:07.100
>> John: "IF YOU GET THE WOMAN,

18:07.100 --> 18:08.266
YOU GET THE FAMILY."

18:08.266 --> 18:09.333
THAT IS A BRAZENLY TRANSPARENT

18:09.333 --> 18:10.333
STATEMENT OF YOUR MARKETING

18:10.333 --> 18:13.700
STRATEGY.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.433
BUT TO BE HONEST,

18:16.433 --> 18:17.500
CAN WE JUST GO BACK TO THAT ROOM

18:17.500 --> 18:18.433
FOR A SECOND?

18:18.433 --> 18:19.500
DO YOU FIND THAT ROOM RELAXING?

18:19.500 --> 18:20.200
IS THAT A SOOTHING SPACE FOR

18:20.200 --> 18:22.900
YOU?

18:22.900 --> 18:24.333
BECAUSE I WOULD BE A LITTLE

18:24.333 --> 18:24.967
DISTURBED BY THE EXTENDED FAMILY

18:24.967 --> 18:25.867
OF GAZELLES SCREAMING "WHY?" AT

18:25.867 --> 18:27.867
ME WITH THEIR DEAD, GLASSY EYES.

18:27.867 --> 18:29.033
NOW, ONE OF THE NRA'S

18:29.033 --> 18:30.767
FEMALE-FOCUSED PROGRAMS,

18:30.767 --> 18:33.500
"LOVE AT FIRST SHOT," IS

18:33.500 --> 18:34.633
EXPLICITLY ABOUT GETTING WOMEN

18:34.633 --> 18:36.367
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA

18:36.367 --> 18:37.667
OF OWNING OR FIRING GUNS, AND IN

18:37.667 --> 18:40.500
ONE EPISODE, THEY TOOK A WOMAN

18:40.500 --> 18:41.834
WHO WAS NERVOUS ABOUT FIREARMS

18:41.834 --> 18:42.800
AND REALLY THREW HER IN AT THE

18:42.800 --> 18:44.567
DEEP END.

18:44.567 --> 18:45.934
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO STRAIGHT

18:45.934 --> 18:47.233
INTO RIFLES, AND WE'RE GOING TO

18:47.233 --> 18:51.700
DO IT WITH AN AR-15.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.467
>> OKAY.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.734
>> I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HEARD

18:55.734 --> 18:56.266
ABOUT THEM ON THE NEWS AND

18:56.266 --> 18:57.033
EVERYTHING ELSE.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.000
>> I HIT THE TARGET.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.734
>> YOU DID.

18:59.734 --> 19:00.433
HOW DID IT FEEL?

19:00.433 --> 19:01.233
>> NOT AS SCARY AS I THINK I WAS

19:01.233 --> 19:02.066
ANTICIPATING.

19:02.066 --> 19:02.834
>> EXACTLY.

19:02.834 --> 19:03.867
IT'S JUST THIS NICE LIGHT POOF

19:03.867 --> 19:05.367
OF HAPPINESS.

19:05.367 --> 19:07.367
>> YEAH, YEAH.

19:07.367 --> 19:08.533
>> John: "A LIGHT POOF OF

19:08.533 --> 19:11.033
HAPPINESS."

19:11.033 --> 19:13.033
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD TO DESCRIBE

19:13.033 --> 19:14.433
A SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE THE WAY

19:14.433 --> 19:16.166
BOB ROSS DESCRIBES

19:16.166 --> 19:19.133
A FUCKING CLOUD.

19:19.133 --> 19:20.600
BUT ONCE "LOVE AT FIRST SHOT"

19:20.600 --> 19:21.567
HAS WOMEN HOOKED, THE UPSELLING

19:21.567 --> 19:22.867
BEGINS, WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES

19:22.867 --> 19:23.867
SENSE.

19:23.867 --> 19:25.633
INDUSTRY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

19:25.633 --> 19:26.567
WOMEN WILL SPEND HUNDREDS OF

19:26.567 --> 19:27.467
DOLLARS ON ACCESSORIES IN

19:27.467 --> 19:29.266
ADDITION TO THEIR GUNS.

19:29.266 --> 19:30.700
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

19:30.700 --> 19:32.734
"LOVE AT FIRST SHOT" FUNCTIONS

19:32.734 --> 19:34.934
AS A KIND OF QVC FOR FIREARMS,

19:34.934 --> 19:36.834
SHOWCASING PRODUCTS LIKE

19:36.834 --> 19:38.300
MAG LOADERS, TARGETS, GUN CASES,

19:38.300 --> 19:40.934
AND HANDBAGS.

19:40.934 --> 19:42.667
>> OKAY, SO, AS YOU SEE HERE,

19:42.667 --> 19:44.133
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

19:44.133 --> 19:46.333
STYLE OPTIONS FOR YOU.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.600
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

19:47.600 --> 19:49.033
VARIETIES OF EXTERIORS, BUT A

19:49.033 --> 19:50.066
LOT OF THEM REALLY HAVE THE SAME

19:50.066 --> 19:51.033
STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF CONCEAL

19:51.033 --> 19:53.166
CARRY.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.000
>> I NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED

19:54.000 --> 19:55.100
THESE LITTLE NEAT POCKETS AND

19:55.100 --> 19:56.133
HIDDEN CLOSURES.

19:56.133 --> 19:57.567
KNOWING THAT YOU CAN CLOSE IT,

19:57.567 --> 19:58.700
IT DOES PUT MY MIND AT EASE WITH

19:58.700 --> 20:00.934
IT, SO IT'S PRETTY COOL.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.100
>> John: GIRL, YOU DON'T EVEN

20:02.100 --> 20:04.300
NEED A GUN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

20:04.300 --> 20:05.700
GOING TO DIE WHEN THEY SEE

20:05.700 --> 20:14.033
THAT BAG.

20:14.033 --> 20:16.433
AND, LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST

20:16.433 --> 20:17.400
HANDBAGS.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.033
EVEN THE GUN ITSELF CAN BE

20:18.033 --> 20:19.266
PROFITABLY ACCESSORIZED.

20:19.266 --> 20:19.867
>> SO YES, WE DO HAVE A CUSTOM

20:19.867 --> 20:21.033
LINE OF GUN PAINT FOR THE LADIES

20:21.033 --> 20:21.500
OUT THERE.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.233
THESE MAGS LOOK PHENOMENAL.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.433
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT'S SO

20:23.433 --> 20:24.567
MUCH FUN TO WORK WITH, AND IT'S

20:24.567 --> 20:26.000
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR

20:26.000 --> 20:26.867
PERSONAL TOUCH ON YOUR FIREARMS

20:26.867 --> 20:29.066
AND YOUR ACCESSORIES.

20:29.066 --> 20:32.800
>> John: OH, THAT'S SO FUN!

20:32.800 --> 20:34.467
THAT IS SO FUN!

20:34.467 --> 20:36.000
OR, IF NATALIE EVER COMMITS

20:36.000 --> 20:37.367
MURDER, A GRAVE OVERSIGHT.

20:37.367 --> 20:38.300
"GOOD NEWS, CHIEF.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.100
THE MAG SAYS THE KILLER'S NAME

20:39.100 --> 20:40.100
RIGHT ON IT.

20:40.100 --> 20:40.934
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MOTIVATED HER

20:40.934 --> 20:42.066
TO GO ON A KILLING SPREE, BUT WE

20:42.066 --> 20:43.467
DO KNOW SHE HAD A LOT OF FUN

20:43.467 --> 20:45.500
WITH IT."

20:45.500 --> 20:47.033
WE'VE WATCHED EVERY SINGLE

20:47.033 --> 20:48.266
EPISODE OF "LOVE AT FIRST SHOT,"

20:48.266 --> 20:49.400
AND I HAVE TO SHOW YOU OUR

20:49.400 --> 20:50.400
FAVORITE CLIP.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.967
IT'S FROM SEASON 2, EPISODE 1.

20:52.967 --> 20:54.000
THE HOST, NATALIE, IS PREGNANT

20:54.000 --> 20:55.033
AT THIS POINT, SO SHE CAN'T JOIN

20:55.033 --> 20:56.700
IN ON THE SHOOTING, BUT THAT

20:56.700 --> 20:57.700
DOESN'T MEAN THEY DIDN'T FIND A

20:57.700 --> 21:00.033
WAY TO GET HER INVOLVED.

21:00.033 --> 21:02.567
>> WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ART FOR

21:02.567 --> 21:03.433
NATALIE SINCE SHE COULDN'T BE ON

21:03.433 --> 21:06.066
THE RANGE WITH US.

21:06.066 --> 21:07.433
>> AW.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.633
>> WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING

21:08.633 --> 21:09.233
SPECIAL FOR HER TO HANG IN HER

21:09.233 --> 21:10.133
BABY NURSERY.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.166
>> YEAH!

21:11.166 --> 21:12.200
THAT'S SO COOL!

21:15.300 --> 21:16.166
>> THERE WE GO!

21:16.166 --> 21:17.300
TWO FOR ONE!

21:17.300 --> 21:18.100
>> TWO FOR ONE!

21:18.100 --> 21:18.734
>> WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE

21:18.734 --> 21:19.400
EXPECTING, OBVIOUSLY, SO WE

21:19.400 --> 21:21.633
THOUGHT WE WOULD MAKE A LITTLE

21:21.633 --> 21:22.400
SOMETHING FOR THE BABY'S

21:22.400 --> 21:23.600
NURSERY.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.033
>> OH, BECAUSE YOU KNOW --

21:25.033 --> 21:25.867
OH, YOU GUYS.

21:25.867 --> 21:30.233
>> WE SHOT PAINT.

21:30.233 --> 21:31.700
>> John: YEAH, THEY SHOT PAINT.

21:31.700 --> 21:32.367
SO WHEN SOMEBODY INEVITABLY ASKS

21:32.367 --> 21:33.333
WHY YOU HAVE WHAT APPEARS TO BE

21:33.333 --> 21:34.667
A BLANK CANVAS WITH A LARGE

21:34.667 --> 21:35.667
BLOODSTAIN HANGING UP IN YOUR

21:35.667 --> 21:36.934
CHILD'S NURSERY, YOU'LL BE ABLE

21:36.934 --> 21:37.900
TO COMPLETELY REASSURE THEM BY

21:37.900 --> 21:40.400
SAYING, "OH, YEAH, MY FRIEND

21:40.400 --> 21:42.300
SHOT THAT FOR ME."

21:42.300 --> 21:44.633
BUT IT'S NOT ALL FUN WITH GUNS.

21:44.633 --> 21:45.934
WHERE NRATV REALLY COMES INTO

21:45.934 --> 21:46.800
ITS OWN IS WHEN ITS TONE GETS

21:46.800 --> 21:48.433
MUCH DARKER.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.100
WHICH IT DOES.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.800
FOR INSTANCE, THEY HAVE A SERIES

21:51.800 --> 21:52.767
OF HUNTING VIDEOS, WHICH

21:52.767 --> 22:00.567
SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING.

22:00.567 --> 22:01.100
IN FACT, IT MAKES COMPLETE

22:01.100 --> 22:01.700
SENSE.

22:01.700 --> 22:02.433
PEOPLE DO USE GUNS WHEN THEY

22:02.433 --> 22:03.200
HUNT.

22:03.200 --> 22:03.900
BUT WHILE THE VISUALS ARE

22:03.900 --> 22:04.700
PREDICTABLE BEAUTY SHOTS OF

22:04.700 --> 22:05.667
NATURE, THE VOICEOVER TAKES A

22:05.667 --> 22:06.500
DIFFERENT PATH.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.066
>> SOMEWHERE OVER THIS HORIZON

22:08.066 --> 22:09.300
SIT A MILLION LITTLE DICTATORS

22:09.300 --> 22:10.567
EAGER TO PURGE HUMANITY OF ITS

22:10.567 --> 22:15.266
HUNTING INSTINCTS.

22:15.266 --> 22:17.767
THE ANTI-HUNTERS HAVE IMPOSED A

22:17.767 --> 22:19.800
FALSE ORDER ON THEIR LIVES BASED

22:19.800 --> 22:22.233
ON A MISCONCEIVED PERCEPTION OF

22:22.233 --> 22:25.600
THE WORLD.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.033
DEATH IS EVIL, THEY BELIEVE, AND

22:27.033 --> 22:29.100
SO THE PURVEYOR OF DEATH MUST

22:29.100 --> 22:31.333
ALSO BE EVIL.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.633
DEATH IS AN UNDENIABLE FUEL OF

22:32.633 --> 22:37.633
LIFE.

22:37.633 --> 22:39.700
>> John: OH, MY GOD.

22:39.700 --> 22:40.667
THAT IS LESS "PLANET EARTH" AND

22:40.667 --> 22:41.333
MORE "DERANGED LETTER FROM A

22:41.333 --> 22:42.333
SERIAL KILLER."

22:42.333 --> 22:43.467
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST, I'D

22:43.467 --> 22:44.567
RESPECT THE NRA MORE IF ITS

22:44.567 --> 22:45.400
SLOGAN WERE JUST "THE NRA:

22:45.400 --> 22:46.667
BECAUSE DEATH IS AN UNDENIABLE

22:46.667 --> 22:48.200
FUEL OF LIFE."

22:48.200 --> 22:49.300
I WOULDN'T LIKE IT, BUT AT LEAST

22:49.300 --> 22:50.633
WE'D BE CLEAR WHERE THEY WERE

22:50.633 --> 22:52.767
COMING FROM.

22:52.767 --> 22:56.200
AND THAT FLOWERY,

22:56.200 --> 22:57.166
VAGUELY THREATENING TONE IS A

22:57.166 --> 22:58.500
KEY FEATURE OF NRATV.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.066
HERE'S ANOTHER WEIRD EXAMPLE.

23:00.066 --> 23:01.467
>> HIDDEN BENEATH THE DENSE

23:01.467 --> 23:03.100
CANOPY OF DECIDUOUS TREES IS A

23:03.100 --> 23:04.567
PROSTITUTE OF SORTS, AND THOSE

23:04.567 --> 23:06.133
WHO PROFIT BY SELLING HER WILL

23:06.133 --> 23:08.100
STOP AT NOTHING TO EXPLOIT HER.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.367
SOLD AND PROMOTED FOR HER

23:09.367 --> 23:11.433
NON-ADDICTIVE, EVEN MEDICINAL

23:11.433 --> 23:13.066
ADVANTAGES, WHAT LIES BEHIND THE

23:13.066 --> 23:14.567
VEIL OF THIS SEDUCTRESS IS FAR

23:14.567 --> 23:15.800
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT SHE FIRST

23:15.800 --> 23:18.100
APPEARS TO BE.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.300
SHE IS A HARLOT, AND HER NAME IS

23:19.300 --> 23:25.633
MARY JANE.

23:25.633 --> 23:27.100
>> John: I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS

23:27.100 --> 23:28.533
POSSIBLE, BUT I THINK THAT GUY

23:28.533 --> 23:31.600
JUST SLUT-SHAMED MARIJUANA.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.767
"AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON

23:33.767 --> 23:35.500
MUSHROOMS, THOSE FILTHY TRAMPS.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.100
THEY'LL GROW NEXT TO ANY TREE AT

23:37.100 --> 23:38.166
ALL.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.900
WHORES WITH SPORES, THAT'S WHAT

23:40.900 --> 23:42.633
I CALL 'EM."

23:42.633 --> 23:44.333
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY

23:44.333 --> 23:47.700
NRATV IS EVEN TALKING ABOUT

23:47.700 --> 23:48.734
DRUGS AT ALL, THE FINAL

23:48.734 --> 23:49.734
DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE

23:49.734 --> 23:51.800
NETWORK IS PAINTING A BLEAK

23:51.800 --> 23:53.700
VISION OF AMERICA WITH THREATS

23:53.700 --> 23:54.900
AROUND EVERY SINGLE CORNER AND

23:54.900 --> 23:56.500
ONE SOLUTION.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.800
>> THE NEXT ATTACK ON OUR SOIL

23:57.800 --> 23:59.166
COULD COME IN A MATTER OF

23:59.166 --> 24:00.300
MINUTES.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.567
>> TEENAGE GIRLS ARE TRAFFICKED

24:01.567 --> 24:03.767
IN SEX TRADE.

24:03.767 --> 24:05.200
>> TODAY'S AMERICA IS PLAGUED BY

24:05.200 --> 24:06.600
URBAN RIOTS AND DOMESTIC ISIS

24:06.600 --> 24:08.767
SYMPATHIZERS.

24:08.767 --> 24:10.333
>> IN A NATURAL DISASTER, YOU

24:10.333 --> 24:11.834
MAY CALL 911, AND THERE MAY BE

24:11.834 --> 24:13.033
NOBODY ON THE OTHER LINE.

24:13.033 --> 24:14.667
>> THE DRUG CARTELS AND THE

24:14.667 --> 24:16.033
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE

24:16.033 --> 24:17.633
INVADED OUR BORDERS AND EMBEDDED

24:17.633 --> 24:19.600
IN EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CITY.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.467
>> THIS THREAT IS REAL.

24:22.467 --> 24:24.734
OUR LEADERS ARE EITHER INCAPABLE

24:24.734 --> 24:25.800
OF OR UNWILLING TO PROTECT YOU,

24:25.800 --> 24:27.967
AND THE AR-15 IS ONE OF THE MOST

24:27.967 --> 24:29.800
EFFECTIVE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO

24:29.800 --> 24:31.166
PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR

24:31.166 --> 24:33.467
FAMILY.

24:33.467 --> 24:34.867
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

24:34.867 --> 24:36.667
THEY'RE USING THE SAME

24:36.667 --> 24:38.934
TECHNIQUES AS AN INFOMERCIAL.

24:38.934 --> 24:40.033
"IS HUMAN TRAFFIC GETTING YOU

24:40.033 --> 24:41.700
DOWN?

24:41.700 --> 24:43.300
DO YOU HAVE ISIS SYMPATHIZERS IN

24:43.300 --> 24:45.934
THOSE HARD

24:45.934 --> 24:47.000
ARE YOU TIRED OF GETTING 9/11'D?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.467
THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY!

24:51.467 --> 24:52.433
TRY THE AR-15!

24:52.433 --> 24:53.800
AVAILABLE AT WAY TOO MANY STORES

24:53.800 --> 24:57.600
NEAR YOU."

24:57.600 --> 24:59.333
NOW, TO WATCH NRATV IS TO WATCH

24:59.333 --> 25:01.467
A CONSTANT STREAM OF STORIES

25:01.467 --> 25:02.367
LIKE THOSE -- MANY REAL, BUT

25:02.367 --> 25:03.200
AMPLIFIED TO TERRIFY YOU AND

25:03.200 --> 25:04.133
SELL YOU PRODUCTS.

25:04.133 --> 25:05.100
AND THERE MAY BE A GOOD REASON

25:05.100 --> 25:07.734
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL --

25:07.734 --> 25:10.834
BECAUSE IT IS.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.166
MANY OF NRATV'S SHOWS ARE

25:12.166 --> 25:13.433
SPONSORED BY GUN BRANDS LIKE

25:13.433 --> 25:14.200
SMITH & WESSON.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.033
AND BEHIND THE SCENES OF NRATV

25:15.033 --> 25:22.133
IS AN AD AGENCY.

25:22.133 --> 25:22.834
IT'S CALLED ACKERMAN McQUEEN.

25:22.834 --> 25:24.734
THEY'VE WORKED WITH THE NRA FOR

25:24.734 --> 25:27.967
DECADES, AND THE

25:27.967 --> 25:30.000
ACKERMAN McQUEEN WEBSITE

25:30.000 --> 25:32.533
PROCLAIMS, "EVERY BRAND MUST BE

25:32.533 --> 25:33.133
ITS OWN MEDIA COMPANY."

25:33.133 --> 25:33.834
AND THAT'S WHAT THE NRA HAVE

25:33.834 --> 25:34.500
DONE WITH THEIR TV ARM.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.500
THEY'VE GOT A PRODUCT TO SELL,

25:35.500 --> 25:36.100
AND THEY EMPLOY PEOPLE WHO CAN

25:36.100 --> 25:36.867
SELL THAT PRODUCT.

25:36.867 --> 25:37.600
EVEN DANA LOESCH, THE CLENCHED

25:37.600 --> 25:38.767
FIST OF TRUTH, WHEN SHE'S NOT

25:38.767 --> 25:39.400
WARNING OF THE DRUG CARTELS AND

25:39.400 --> 25:40.100
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS IN EVERY

25:40.100 --> 25:42.734
SINGLE AMERICAN CITY, IS SELLING

25:42.734 --> 25:45.200
YOU SOME OTHER SHIT.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.667
>> HI, I'M DANA LOESCH FROM

25:46.667 --> 25:47.934
"THE DANA SHOW."

25:47.934 --> 25:48.867
THERE'S ONE SUPERFOOD I DRINK

25:48.867 --> 25:49.767
EVERY DAY FOR HEALTHY

25:49.767 --> 25:50.800
CIRCULATION AND TO MAKE ME FEEL

25:50.800 --> 25:52.233
GREAT ALL DAY LONG.

25:52.233 --> 25:55.367
IT'S CALLED SUPERBEETS, AND YOU

25:55.367 --> 25:56.633
CAN TRY IT FOR YOURSELF

25:56.633 --> 25:57.967
RISK FREE.

25:57.967 --> 25:59.233
I TAKE SUPERBEETS AS MY

25:59.233 --> 26:00.433
PRE-WORKOUT IN THE MORNING AND

26:00.433 --> 26:01.400
AS A NON-JITTERY PICK-ME-UP IN

26:01.400 --> 26:02.633
THE AFTERNOON.

26:02.633 --> 26:03.667
AND JUST ONE TEASPOON OF

26:03.667 --> 26:05.166
SUPERBEETS GIVES YOU THE BENEFIT

26:05.166 --> 26:06.767
OF THREE WHOLE BEETS.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.767
>> John: WOW, DANA.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.800
THREE WHOLE BEETS.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.367
THAT'S MORE THAN MY DELICIOUS

26:12.367 --> 26:15.400
SUPERFOOD, "MEDIUM BEETS."

26:15.400 --> 26:16.767
IT GIVES YOU THE BENEFITS OF TWO

26:16.767 --> 26:18.600
WHOLE BEETS, WHICH IS, AND THIS

26:18.600 --> 26:20.734
IS TRUE, ENOUGH.

26:20.734 --> 26:23.100
THAT'S A PERFECTLY ADEQUATE

26:23.100 --> 26:29.467
NUMBER OF BEETS.

26:29.467 --> 26:31.867
THE WHOLE POINT HERE IS,

26:31.867 --> 26:34.967
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION

26:34.967 --> 26:37.900
"WHAT THE FUCK IS NRATV?"

26:37.900 --> 26:38.934
IS, "IT'S JUST A VESSEL

26:38.934 --> 26:39.533
TO SELL AMERICA GUNS."

26:39.533 --> 26:40.333
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

26:40.333 --> 26:41.100
DOES IT WORK?

26:41.100 --> 26:41.667
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.667
THEY WON'T REVEAL THEIR RATINGS,

26:42.667 --> 26:43.333
SO IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT NO ONE IS

26:43.333 --> 26:47.700
WATCHING THIS AND THAT AD

26:47.700 --> 26:48.667
AGENCY, ACKERMAN McQUEEN, ARE

26:48.667 --> 26:49.200
MAKING OUT LIKE BANDITS.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.166
HAVING WATCHED A SHITLOAD OF

26:50.166 --> 26:54.066
NRATV'S PROGRAMMING, HERE'S WHAT

26:54.066 --> 26:54.834
I'LL SAY ABOUT IT.

26:54.834 --> 26:55.767
THERE IS A LOT TO BE CONCERNED

26:55.767 --> 26:56.867
ABOUT REGARDING THE NRA'S

26:56.867 --> 26:57.967
ACTIVITIES, BUT NRATV MIGHT

26:57.967 --> 26:58.633
ACTUALLY BE THE DUMBEST, MOST

26:58.633 --> 27:00.734
TRANSPARENT THING IT DOES.

27:00.734 --> 27:02.233
THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

27:02.233 --> 27:04.567
IF THE NRA IS A FEROCIOUS BEAR

27:04.567 --> 27:06.667
CHARGING AT YOU, NRATV IS

27:06.667 --> 27:08.834
THAT BEAR'S RIDICULOUS HAT.

27:08.834 --> 27:09.800
IS IT EYE

27:09.800 --> 27:12.333
SURE.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.734
IS IT PERVERSELY ENTERTAINING?

27:13.734 --> 27:14.934
ABSOLUTELY.

27:14.934 --> 27:15.967
IS IT THE MAIN THING YOU SHOULD

27:15.967 --> 27:16.934
BE WORRIED ABOUT?

27:16.934 --> 27:20.633
PROBABLY NOT.

27:20.633 --> 27:22.400
BECAUSE THE REAL TRUTH HERE IS,

27:22.400 --> 27:24.166
HAT OR NO HAT, IT IS IMPERATIVE

27:24.166 --> 27:25.767
THAT EVERYONE KEEP THEIR EYES ON

27:25.767 --> 27:27.300
THAT FUCKING BEAR.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.667
AND NOW THIS.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.133
>> AND NOW PROOF THAT NRATV'S

27:31.133 --> 27:33.000
TONE CAN MAKE ANYTHING SEEM

27:33.000 --> 27:38.133
SCARY.

27:38.133 --> 27:41.400
>> HAS YOUR KITCHEN THAT ONCE

27:41.400 --> 27:42.533
GLEAMED IN THE SOFT GLOW OF DAWN

27:42.533 --> 27:51.900
NOW BECOME A LOG OF COUNTERTOPS?

27:51.900 --> 27:56.266
SHE IS THE OVEN'S CONTEMPTIBLE

27:56.266 --> 28:00.000
WHORE, AND HER NAME IS MUFFINS.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.100
THE MUFFINS GLUTINOUS PRISON,

28:03.100 --> 28:06.266
EACH A FOOD SLAVE IN ITS CRUSTY

28:06.266 --> 28:07.133
WALLS.

28:07.133 --> 28:08.667
AMERICANS ONCE RELISHED OUR

28:08.667 --> 28:09.567
RIGHT TO A STACK OF FLAPJACKS

28:09.567 --> 28:14.066
AND A CUP OF JOE, BUT NOW WE

28:14.066 --> 28:20.000
TREMBLE BEFORE SATAN'S CUPCAKES.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.066
SHOW UNCUT AND FLAPJACKS AND

28:23.066 --> 28:24.200
STACKED.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.600
WHEN THE MUFFINS RISE, WE MUST

28:25.600 --> 28:29.233
RISE AGAINST THEM, BECAUSE YOU

28:29.233 --> 28:32.033
DON'T KNOW THE MUFFIN MAN,

28:32.033 --> 28:32.967
AMERICO, AND YOU HAD BETTER PRAY

28:32.967 --> 28:37.033
YOU NEVER DO.

28:37.033 --> 28:39.233
PANCAKES, THE UNDENIABLE VIEW OF

28:39.233 --> 28:41.934
LIFE.

28:41.934 --> 28:43.500
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.734
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

28:45.734 --> 28:47.000
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
GOOD NIGHT!
