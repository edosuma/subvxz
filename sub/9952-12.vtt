00:01.502 --> 00:02.958
NATHAN: Previously on Haven...

00:03.045 --> 00:05.172
Somebody out there
with a tattoo wants to kill me.

00:05.339 --> 00:09.708
You have the opportunity to succeed
where your father so tragically failed.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.300
We're chasing down the troubled.

00:11.387 --> 00:14.174
We're gonna do what we should have done
a long time ago. Wipe them out.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.300
(GUNSHOT)

00:15.391 --> 00:17.302
AUDREY: Maybe by shooting the Rev,
/ just made things worse.

00:17.393 --> 00:19.349
-I found this for you.
-Whose address is this?

00:19.437 --> 00:21.519
-Lucy Ripley's.
-Thank you.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.556
Excuse me, are you Lucy Ripley?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.685
A man came here.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.641
-Do you remember his name?
-Simon Crocker.

00:27.737 --> 00:31.571
Whatever is going on in this town,
they think that you're in the middle of it.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.238
What? Tell me.

00:33.409 --> 00:36.822
You're gonna tell him what he wants to know,
or I will.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.153
EVi!

00:40.249 --> 00:43.241
You're not gonna believe
what my father had hidden below decks.

00:43.419 --> 00:46.456
Your father is exactly why I'm here.
I think he was looking for me.

00:46.756 --> 00:50.169
"It's up to you to finish my work.
You must kill her."

00:50.301 --> 00:51.962
Why did he want you to kill me?

01:02.980 --> 01:04.140
ARLO: Bill!

01:04.982 --> 01:06.142
Bill!

01:07.026 --> 01:08.562
Bill, wake up!

01:09.445 --> 01:12.027
Sheila's in danger.
You have to go over there.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.858
-This has to be a dream.
-There's someone in my house.

01:17.161 --> 01:20.369
Arlo, you can't be here.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.788
-You're dead.
-Please, Bill, he has a gun.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.157
Hurry!

01:28.339 --> 01:29.670
Arlo?

01:29.966 --> 01:31.376
I'm coming, Sheila.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.878
Arlo, how can you be here?

01:37.640 --> 01:39.050
ARLO: No, Sheila.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.762
No lights. He'll see you.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.722
Oh. Okay, honey.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.689
-Where is he?
-Shh.

01:46.148 --> 01:49.686
Follow me.
I'll keep you safe until Bill gets here.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.313
(GLASS BREAKING)

01:57.493 --> 01:59.029
-(SCREAMS)
-Sheilal

02:10.172 --> 02:11.252
Nice shooting, Bill.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.544
Arlo. What happened?

02:15.386 --> 02:16.501
Payback.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.548
For screwing my wife.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.343
(BILL GASPING)

02:47.501 --> 02:48.957
-Audrey.
-Hey, Duke.

02:49.128 --> 02:51.835
-Can I talk to you?
-Actually, I'm busy. Can wejust do this later?

02:51.922 --> 02:53.423
No.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.917
I don't think we can.

02:55.468 --> 03:00.087
I need you to know that
I'm not on some kind of mission for my dad.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.679
I didn't like him when he was alive,

03:02.767 --> 03:06.476
and I'm certainly not gonna
kill anyone for him now that he is dead.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.852
Especially not you.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.271
That's good. I can check that off my list.

03:11.609 --> 03:14.100
-I don't wanna joke about this.
-Listen.

03:14.487 --> 03:18.105
We'll figure it out, right?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.944
Right.

03:29.794 --> 03:32.957
VINCE: Well, you're a welcome sight.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.046
What's knittin', kitten?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.465
AUDREY: That you?

03:43.516 --> 03:46.474
That was the biggest fish I ever caught,
but that was a long time ago.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.142
-In fact, that salmon held a...
-And that's you, too, right?

03:49.647 --> 03:52.309
Well, I don't recall exactly, but...

03:53.651 --> 03:55.016
No more lies!

03:58.239 --> 04:00.776
All this time,
I've been searching for my identity,

04:00.866 --> 04:02.242
and you knew who I was?

04:06.163 --> 04:07.573
Why didn't you tell me?

04:10.876 --> 04:11.991
I'm sorry.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.993
-Vince.
-She knows.

04:16.549 --> 04:18.005
What's the point now?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.838
Why are you lying to me?

04:22.179 --> 04:24.511
-We were waiting until you...
-What? Ready?

04:25.224 --> 04:27.385
I'm ready now. So talk.

04:28.853 --> 04:29.933
Who am |?

04:31.439 --> 04:32.554
You were Lucy.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.772
Before that, Sarah.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.860
Before that, we're not sure.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.234
There's a lot we don't understand.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.029
Like where you go in between The Troubles.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.694
How you always look the same,

04:48.956 --> 04:53.290
but you have a new person's memory
each time you return.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.538
The only thing that's the same

04:56.380 --> 04:58.917
is that you always help
the troubled when you do.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.884
Who is Agent Howard?

05:09.727 --> 05:10.933
Great.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.640
That's great.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.776
Yeah, go ahead.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.083
VINCE: It was Sarah's.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.082
The woman in the photo.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.172
Why do you have it?

05:46.805 --> 05:50.013
She was a friend.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.926
It belongs to you now.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.139
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

05:56.106 --> 05:57.186
Damn it.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.276
All right, this conversation is not over.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.028
You told her too much.

06:12.623 --> 06:13.829
She needs my help.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.451
And you're not getting in my way this time.

06:37.982 --> 06:41.520
Very impressive, Duke.
Like what you've done with my place.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.648
Dad?

06:48.659 --> 06:49.990
You're dead.

07:36.707 --> 07:40.370
We start at 9:00 am. in the Haven PD.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.748
-Where were you?
-Who's the vic?

07:47.718 --> 07:49.674
Sheila McMartin.

07:49.762 --> 07:52.094
A neighbor woke her up
with three shots to the chest.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.423
He admits to the shooting.
He's in some kind of shock.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.515
He keeps repeating, "Arlo made me do it."

07:57.603 --> 07:59.764
-So?
-That's where it gets interesting.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.387
Arlo was Sheila's husband.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.686
-So an angry ex?
-Try dead husband.

08:05.027 --> 08:08.190
That's a lame stab at an insanity defense.
So what's the interesting part?

08:08.614 --> 08:10.946
Neighbors, they heard the shots,

08:12.409 --> 08:14.240
saw Arlo leaving the house.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.496
Okay, so if he faked his death, then
there's gotta be some kind of digital trail.

08:19.583 --> 08:23.041
Email, phone calls, bank accounts.
They all leave a record.

08:30.803 --> 08:32.418
We should have dinner.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.587
Together.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.768
Dinner.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.604
Sure.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.106
Tomorrow night?

08:51.448 --> 08:54.440
We can talk about Lucy and...

08:55.744 --> 08:57.325
Everything.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.785
How about I... How about | make pancakes?

09:08.632 --> 09:10.839
Are we talking dinner or...

09:12.302 --> 09:13.587
Breakfast?

09:28.485 --> 09:32.319
DUKE: Damn. I really hoped l'd walked
back in here to see that you'd disappeared.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.280
(SIGHS)

09:35.701 --> 09:38.158
-You're taking this well.
-Yes, I am.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.741
You see, I'm pretty sure
that you're the result of the brownies

09:41.832 --> 09:43.993
that this girl gave me last night.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.494
God, what was her name? Tall, Dutch girl?

09:48.839 --> 09:51.000
You're not imagining this.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.594
Says the dead guy I last saw 27 years ago.

10:00.184 --> 10:05.099
But sure, okay, let's go with it.
Let's say you're real.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.354
How are you? How you been?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.770
-Why are you back?
-I don't know.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.352
Let me take a guess.

10:14.490 --> 10:18.779
You're gonna disappear for a few days,
and I won't have any idea why.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.948
And then you'll show back up,
bloody and beaten up,

10:22.039 --> 10:23.870
and expect me to nurse you back to health.

10:23.999 --> 10:28.333
Look, I know I was a crap father
and worse husband.

10:28.837 --> 10:35.379
Check and check. You know, I gotta tell you,
you are much smarter dead and imaginary.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.549
You found my weapons.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.678
The Troubles must be back.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.228
Yes, they are. You know... I'm...
This must be a dream.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.727
That's got to be...
Are there mermaids out there?

10:50.818 --> 10:51.898
You cure anybody yet?

10:53.695 --> 10:57.404
Uh... No, not that I'm aware of.
You know, this has been fun,

10:57.533 --> 10:59.569
but I'm gonna go back to bed
and hope that I wake up.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.908
Hey. You are awake.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.194
You know that's real, right?

11:07.835 --> 11:08.915
Right.

11:09.378 --> 11:13.087
I know I wasn't around,
but there was a reason. Okay?

11:13.674 --> 11:15.414
l was out saving people.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.510
Oh, really?
And how were you out saving people?

11:19.763 --> 11:22.004
When someone from our family
kills a cursed person,

11:22.099 --> 11:25.057
we don'tjust kill their body,
we kill the curse, too.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.180
That's our trouble.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.426
Oh.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.597
So you save them from being alive. Got it.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.190
The curse dies in the whole family.

11:34.278 --> 11:37.190
No one will ever get it again.
Not the children. Not the grandchildren.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.522
No one. The curse never comes back.

11:40.409 --> 11:43.446
You just have to murder somebody
to do it. Wow.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.527
You really are a piece of work.

11:46.123 --> 11:49.786
Now I know why I'm here,
to make you understand.

11:56.967 --> 12:00.630
Arlo's estate's been settled.
His credit cards are canceled.

12:01.805 --> 12:05.389
Smart people who fake their own deaths,
put away the plastic.

12:06.143 --> 12:09.135
Only one way to find out for sure
if he's dead.

12:09.605 --> 12:12.142
Talk to the gravedigger. Excuse me.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.738
-Kyle Hopkins?
-Yeah.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.324
-Haven PD.
-I know who you are.

12:21.783 --> 12:25.446
Because of you, I had to bury
Reverend Driscoll, the finest man in Haven.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.453
And I know what you are.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.574
-You need to watch your mouth.
-|t's a free country.

12:32.169 --> 12:35.457
His kind wants to have meetings,
and my kind needs to call it like it is.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.668
I need you to dig up Arlo McMartin.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.253
-You got a court order?
-You're on probation, right?

12:41.929 --> 12:44.011
-So?
-So that joint you just tossed?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.088
It could cost you some time.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.766
Or you could dig up a grave.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.602
It's your call.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.194
NATHAN: Definitely not faking it.

13:01.949 --> 13:02.984
AUDREY: Hmm.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.440
So what do you think?

13:05.535 --> 13:08.117
Clones? Ghosts? Zombies are trendy.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.200
Wuornos.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.866
Where?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.377
Okay, we'll meet you there.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.669
Homicide.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.799
-Another dead guy do it?
-No.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.049
Dead girl told her brother to do it.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.810
It says here that your sister, Annie,
she committed suicide over a year ago.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.640
After Kurt raped her.

13:36.149 --> 13:40.233
Annie sat down right next to me
and told me the truth.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.108
And Kurt confirmed this?

13:47.786 --> 13:48.992
Eventually.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.747
Does it seem to you like Bruce's sister
came back for revenge?

13:58.088 --> 13:59.669
Or to tell the truth.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.747
To her big brother? Same thing.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.416
Nathan. Audrey.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.127
Uh... Heard there was a murder
on Woodland Drive.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.553
At the McMartin house, right?

14:08.724 --> 14:10.840
VINCE: Sheila was shot three times.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.017
And the killer
claims to have seen Arlo McMartin.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.765
Could Bill and Sheila have been a couple?

14:17.315 --> 14:18.566
Everyone knew that.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.191
Were they sleeping together
before Arlo died?

14:21.278 --> 14:22.893
That's what killed Arlo.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.775
Someone told him and bam,
massive coronary.

14:27.242 --> 14:30.029
So maybe the dead are coming back
to settle old scores?

14:30.162 --> 14:32.824
And they're using the living to do it for them.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.000
You'll be all right, Kyle.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.342
-More than all right.
-Reverend Driscoll.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.766
How?

14:56.521 --> 15:01.311
God has sent me to finish my work in Haven.
Will you help me?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.164
SIMON: What do you see?

15:20.837 --> 15:22.418
A field.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.920
And 26 years ago, last May,
there was a third grade camp out here.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.754
Mrs. Holloway's class.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.507
Yeah, all those kids died.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.759
I knew some of them.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.431
Remember how they died?

15:36.353 --> 15:37.593
Food poisoning.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.021
Or not.

15:42.359 --> 15:46.477
The tents were pitched in a big circle,
here around a fire.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.362
Mrs. Holloway told a campfire story.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.446
lt scared Jenny Mears so bad
that her curse kicked in.

15:54.704 --> 15:59.698
Fear poured out of her in toxic waves.
Twelve kids and two chaperons died.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.377
-What does that have to do with you?
-I could have saved them.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.882
I had a chance to kill Jenny's grandfather
a week before their trip.

16:09.719 --> 16:13.211
-But you didn't.
-No. I couldn't.

16:15.392 --> 16:19.226
The day after it happened,
he begged me to kill him.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.354
-And then you did.
-His pain was over in a minute.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.315
Mine lasted.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.311
Every time I saw the parents of those kids.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.069
You have a responsibility, Duke. A destiny.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.991
You can go back to hell.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.871
Hasn't anyone you know
ever died because of The Troubles?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.080
Anyone you cared about?

16:50.635 --> 16:52.751
You could have saved them.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.980
Our dead people had different families
and had differentjobs.

17:09.154 --> 17:12.863
One died of natural causes.
The other one committed suicide.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.782
AUDREY: One was Catholic,
and the other was agnostic.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.407
NATHAN: Mmm-hmm.

17:24.211 --> 17:28.796
And they both had funeral services
at different... Different churches.

17:29.925 --> 17:33.793
But both were buried at...

17:35.388 --> 17:36.924
AUDREY: Eastside Cemetery.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.096
You know, I'll just...

17:52.155 --> 17:55.943
Mark them well, Kyle.
Our brothers will need to find them.

18:06.127 --> 18:09.460
Audrey, I know you think you know Duke.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.213
I do.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.007
No, you don't.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.222
A couple years ago,
Duke rolled back into town.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.683
lnvited me to go fishing.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.390
Wanted to be friends again.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.891
It felt good. I...

18:31.903 --> 18:33.643
I let myself believe he'd changed.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.357
Then I found out the real reason
he wanted me to go fishing.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.655
To cover for him smuggling.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.994
He figured if the Coast Guard pulled up,
I could flash my badge.

18:47.669 --> 18:51.127
(EXHALES) lwas so pissed. I...

18:52.549 --> 18:54.255
I went after him.

18:54.509 --> 18:58.252
And we... We beat on each other for an hour.

19:02.851 --> 19:07.345
And then I realized that I couldn't feel it.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.935
My trouble came back
because of that fight with Duke,

19:15.030 --> 19:17.316
and I don't think he even gave a damn.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.357
Maybe Duke's changed.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.579
You can never trust him.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.116
Okay. Come on.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.836
Here, found it.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.843
"Annie Fresnel."

19:42.432 --> 19:43.922
Okay.

19:44.142 --> 19:47.976
So Bruce's sister's grave looks untouched.
Just like Arlo's.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.144
AUDREY: Everything looks normal.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.105
Cemetery normal, at least.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.101
I don't get it.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.822
-Parker.
-What?

20:04.913 --> 20:06.369
You don't see them?

20:06.748 --> 20:08.363
See who?

20:10.251 --> 20:13.539
Dead people, all around us.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.713
NATHAN: You don't see them?

20:21.805 --> 20:24.797
They're all around us.
Must be 20 of them, more.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.299
No, I don't... I don't see anybody.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.678
But you do? Why?

20:35.860 --> 20:39.193
Maybe it's because
you're immune to The Troubles?

20:48.248 --> 20:49.738
So ghosts are wandering
the streets of Haven,

20:49.833 --> 20:52.495
and I'm the only one that can't see them.
That's perfect.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.588
They're leaving.

20:59.509 --> 21:04.424
-Okay, where are they going?
-Worst case? Off to kill 20 more people.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.852
AUDREY: Wonderful.

21:12.355 --> 21:15.688
Looks like the dead
are making their presence known.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.192
There's no way we can track them all.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.402
We gotta find who's causing this.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.701
Parker?

21:38.089 --> 21:40.466
DUKE: So I ended up
burying the weapons box.

21:40.592 --> 21:43.709
Let me get this straight.
You can end a trouble?

21:44.262 --> 21:48.255
Just have to kill someone to do it.
Try not to forget that part.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.717
Wait, wasn't your father buried at Seaside?

21:52.395 --> 21:56.934
Seaside is eroding.
They moved him here about a year ago.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.814
Wait, who moved him?

21:59.611 --> 22:01.101
Somebody from this cemetery, I guess.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.238
We need to get a hold of the caretaker,
find out who buried who.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.610
Maybe that's our link.

22:06.743 --> 22:07.983
(DUKE SlGHS)

22:14.250 --> 22:17.583
Do you ever wonder why you're here?

22:18.129 --> 22:21.337
No. I mean, that's the one thing
I don't wonder about anymore.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.501
I'm here to help the troubled.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.591
Yeah. But doesn't it...

22:26.763 --> 22:31.598
Doesn't it bother you
that you never really solve anything?

22:33.770 --> 22:38.764
I mean, a week goes by,
a month, 20 years, whatever.

22:42.153 --> 22:48.114
The Troubles keep coming back,
and people keep dying.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.782
l have no alternative.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.124
But what if you did?

23:04.968 --> 23:07.254
The caretaker said that the person
who moved Simon

23:07.345 --> 23:10.428
is the same guy that buried
Arlo McMartin and Annie.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.880
lt's Kyle Hopkins.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.809
We need to find him.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.685
-That's...
-Wait, what do... What do you see?

23:24.529 --> 23:25.894
The Chief?

23:28.241 --> 23:30.072
But he wasn't buried at Eastside.

23:30.827 --> 23:31.987
What is he doing here?

23:32.579 --> 23:35.867
-Take it from me, you may not wanna know.
-Go.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.956
Go, go talk to him.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.076
What do I say?

23:41.170 --> 23:44.537
Nathan, it doesn't matter what you say,
all right?

23:44.799 --> 23:49.463
You get a chance to be with your dad again.
That's a gift. You don't pass that up.

23:49.554 --> 23:50.885
Just go.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.133
I'II... I'll find Kyle.

23:54.726 --> 23:55.966
You two gonna be all right?

23:56.352 --> 23:57.853
Yeah. Go.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.934
Reunions are overrated.

24:08.656 --> 24:14.743
"In memory of Rufus P. Barker, 1812 to 1841

24:16.372 --> 24:19.284
No matter how well prepared
you are for something,

24:19.375 --> 24:22.162
dying has got a way of sneaking up on you.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.084
Hello, Nathan.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.675
Chief.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.301
You all right?

24:33.389 --> 24:36.176
You get blown into a thousand pieces
and tell me how you feel.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.849
I guess I'm mostly one piece here.

24:42.231 --> 24:45.564
So what was the story? How did you
explain my death and everything?

24:46.402 --> 24:48.779
I told people you were lost at sea.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.231
Well, I picked up your pieces.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.783
Put them in a cooler.
Buried you on Goose Hill.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.735
You buried me in a cooler?

24:58.331 --> 24:59.491
Yeah.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.747
-What cooler?
-Blue one.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.745
What a waste of a good cooler.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.085
Dad, what are you doing here?

25:07.840 --> 25:10.502
I don't know. I miss the rain.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.383
-That's not why you're here.
-There's plenty of what you miss.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.338
-That's not why you're here.
-l'm not back from the dead 10 minutes,

25:16.432 --> 25:19.139
-and you're alreadyjumping all over me?
-l'm not... I...

25:19.227 --> 25:20.808
Yeah, you are.

25:23.564 --> 25:28.103
Ghosts are coming back to settle scores.
Is that what you're doing?

25:28.528 --> 25:30.894
No. No, ldon't think so.

25:31.906 --> 25:35.069
I suspect I'm here to see you, Son.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.868
How are things? How are you doing?

25:40.289 --> 25:42.826
I'm talking to my dead dad in a graveyard.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.495
A serious question needs a serious answer.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.373
It's getting more and more dangerous.
The Troubles are everywhere.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.376
The Rev's death has people stirred up.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.008
-Reverend Driscoll's dead?
-Yeah.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.139
Parker shot him.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.218
Good for her. Good.

26:03.771 --> 26:06.103
You knew her when she was Lucy.

26:07.608 --> 26:08.688
Why didn't you tell her?

26:09.694 --> 26:13.562
Well, think about that question for a second,
and tell me what I should have said to her.

26:13.656 --> 26:17.524
I don't think you appreciate
just how precarious our position is here.

26:17.618 --> 26:21.202
This town is like sitting on top of a volcano,
and you're worried about how she feels?

26:21.289 --> 26:22.369
Come on.

26:25.668 --> 26:28.910
You two have gotten kind of close.
Is that so?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.209
I don't know what you mean.

26:32.884 --> 26:35.671
-Are you in love?
-I don't know what it is.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.218
-Well, stop.
-What?

26:38.306 --> 26:41.389
You two can't be in love.
She's just too important to this town.

26:41.476 --> 26:45.094
-What does one have to do with the other?
-Because, Nathan, if she's in love with you,

26:45.188 --> 26:47.429
she'll wanna take risks for you,
and we can't have that.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.980
You have got to keep her alive.
Understand me?

26:53.529 --> 26:55.110
You came back to tell me that?

26:56.741 --> 26:58.026
That I can't...

26:59.285 --> 27:01.617
That I can't be in love with Audrey?

27:03.414 --> 27:05.325
Yeah, I guess I did.

27:09.670 --> 27:13.504
Well, then, you wasted your time.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.169
Hmm.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.672
AUDREY: Okay, I can't see the dead,
so I need you to be my eyes.

27:23.017 --> 27:26.009
DUKE: Perfect.
AUDREY: Oh, here. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.695
Audrey, what are we doing?

27:37.782 --> 27:40.114
I thought you wanted
to go look for this Kyle guy.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.825
These have been popping up around town.
I've seen a few of them.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.154
So?

27:49.043 --> 27:52.251
AUDREY: Huh. What happened here?
Was somebody attacked?

27:58.135 --> 27:59.170
(DUKE SlGHS)

28:05.101 --> 28:06.682
Are you okay?

28:19.115 --> 28:20.901
You know what?

28:21.742 --> 28:25.109
If you wanna go check the house,
I can keep watch out here.

28:25.246 --> 28:26.486
Thanks.

28:29.750 --> 28:30.956
AUDREY: Hello?

28:38.009 --> 28:39.965
You better not be here to hurt her.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.009
I got more important things to do.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.925
Oh, yeah? Like what?

28:45.308 --> 28:46.969
I've come back for you.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.605
All right, my father told me about his job.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.771
Not interested.

28:54.025 --> 28:57.142
Your father's here? Good. Come with me.

28:58.154 --> 29:01.942
Well, you know what?
Think I'm gonna let the two of you catch up.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.365
Maybe you could hit
the Senior Center together.

29:04.493 --> 29:10.159
Duke, people followed me when lwas alive.
Think what they'll do for me now.

29:12.877 --> 29:14.037
Come with me.

29:16.631 --> 29:20.123
Or I'll take my revenge on Audrey Parker.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.731
NATHAN: Kyle's house is coming up.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.403
I can't believe Duke just left you there.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.492
And I can't believe
that you're not gonna tell me

29:49.580 --> 29:51.195
what your dad said.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.414
I told you. He said
you're important to the town.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.373
Okay. And that's it?

29:55.711 --> 29:58.168
He said he missed the rain on his face.

29:58.255 --> 30:01.713
Yeah, I know that.
That's Wuornos for "I'm not telling you."

30:01.842 --> 30:04.333
But don't worry. I'm not worried.
I'll get it out of you later.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.351
-Can I help you?
-Hi. We're looking...

30:14.438 --> 30:18.397
We're actually... We're looking for
134 Draper Place, the Gundersons?

30:18.734 --> 30:21.066
Don't know them. And this is Park Street.

30:21.362 --> 30:25.401
Oh, wow, I am so sorry.
I told you to ask for directions.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.023
He does this all the time.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.068
Did you see the red on her hands?

30:30.204 --> 30:32.115
It's the same color as the X's
l was telling you about.

30:33.791 --> 30:36.658
-What do the X's have to do with Kyle?
-I don't know.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.494
But it's too much of a coincidence
that they showed up now.

30:39.588 --> 30:43.080
Let's follow and see
if she leads us to her husband.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.060
Chloroform?

31:39.482 --> 31:40.972
MAN: Get the door.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.312
NATHAN: They're gonna burn that building.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.698
People in the shed must be troubled.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.239
I guess we know what the X's marked.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.237
NATHAN: Oh, my God.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.493
The Rev is here.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.162
What is Duke doing here?

32:16.477 --> 32:18.934
You tell me what's happening
or I'm out of here.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.262
Take a look.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.272
DUKE: Oh, my God. What have you done?

32:28.155 --> 32:30.692
ED: They're not dead,
just unconscious.

32:31.951 --> 32:35.864
Couldn't risk their curses
causing us problems.

32:36.705 --> 32:37.956
You are insane.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.119
All of you. You are all insane.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.121
I am not gonna stand here
and let you burn these people.

32:43.212 --> 32:45.544
No, they're not gonna burn.
You're gonna save them.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.503
-Hey. Hey!
-Duke?

32:50.553 --> 32:52.464
What are you doing?

32:53.055 --> 32:54.670
You're working with the Rev?

32:56.892 --> 32:58.848
What? No.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.981
No, of course not. I...

33:07.403 --> 33:09.564
I remember when you preached forgiveness.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.691
l'm fresh out of forgiveness.

33:11.907 --> 33:15.650
-Should I put them in the shed, Reverend?
-No, you should let them go.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.735
You don't need to take orders
from a dead man.

33:17.830 --> 33:21.163
Especially since you're the one
who brought him back, Kyle.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.992
-What are you talking about?
-We talked to the caretaker.

33:24.253 --> 33:27.086
Everyone that's come back,
they have one thing in common.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.079
You dug their graves.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.716
Call him. Check for yourself.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.426
So what? I dug a lot of graves.

33:37.766 --> 33:40.052
They always fight the truth at first.

33:40.519 --> 33:44.762
No,no,no,no,no,no.
Reverend, tell them it's not true.

33:50.446 --> 33:52.277
Then they have that moment,

33:52.364 --> 33:54.901
where they realize why all their lives
they felt different.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.620
Honey, they're wrong. I swear.

34:00.748 --> 34:02.784
And then they start to beg.

34:03.792 --> 34:04.952
Marissa?

34:08.797 --> 34:10.207
Reverend Driscoll, please.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.962
Sorry, can't help you, Kyle. But he can.

34:15.804 --> 34:20.764
He can save your unborn child
from that terrible curse.

34:25.814 --> 34:28.806
No. No, wait, wait. Hold on.

34:30.736 --> 34:33.648
Save him. Save his family.

34:48.337 --> 34:49.918
It's time, Son.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.764
Duke, what are you doing?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.809
Please. You have to do it.

35:07.314 --> 35:11.432
You have to save my child
from getting the curse. From me.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.142
No, we can stop this.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.773
Don't listen to her.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.365
She's a liar.

35:21.620 --> 35:22.700
No.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.541
She's my friend.

35:36.552 --> 35:40.886
Your friend killed your grandfather.
Her name was Sarah then.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.764
She was Lucy when she killed me.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.726
Duke, put the knife down.

35:48.188 --> 35:51.680
Now she's called Audrey,
and she will kill you.

35:53.736 --> 35:54.771
No.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.519
The tattooed man is supposed to kill me.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.775
She doesn't have to do it
with her own hands.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.002
AUDREY: Kyle.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.469
MARISSA: No, don't.

36:20.554 --> 36:21.760
I love you.

36:24.308 --> 36:25.593
Thank you.

36:26.143 --> 36:28.225
My son will be safe now.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.280
I know you helped her kill me, Garland.

36:45.621 --> 36:48.579
No. She just beat me to it.

36:50.084 --> 36:51.449
I hear she killed you, too.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.337
At least he's got a taste
of what he's capable of.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.169
That's all that matters.

36:56.298 --> 36:57.583
Well, she'll kill him, too.

36:57.674 --> 36:58.925
Not this time.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.342
She can't stop my son.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.589
l have a son, too, you know.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.348
Damn good one.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.763
Just take care of our girl. Okay?

37:46.348 --> 37:48.509
Put your guns down! Now!

37:49.059 --> 37:50.344
Now!

37:55.357 --> 37:57.348
You're all under arrest.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.744
Heard the Chief was back.

38:18.881 --> 38:23.045
Made me wonder how that happened,
so I started looking for an explanation.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.044
-And I found one.
-Dave.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.213
When did you have
the Hopkins kid dig him up?

38:29.308 --> 38:32.596
-I had no idea any of this would happen.
-Yeah.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.306
I paid Kyle to dig him up three weeks ago.

38:36.273 --> 38:38.264
You did this without even talking to me.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.391
-Well, you wouldn't have agreed.
-Damn right.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.273
-We need Garland back.
-No, we don't.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.781
-We'll be fine.
-You're fooling yourself, Dave.

38:47.910 --> 38:51.323
It's different this time.
She's different this time.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.679
(SOFT JAZZ PLAYING ON THE STEREO)

39:33.163 --> 39:34.323
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

39:38.335 --> 39:40.951
Nathan, you're early.

39:45.259 --> 39:46.294
(GASPS)

39:59.731 --> 40:01.062
Parker?

40:04.194 --> 40:05.434
Parker?

40:18.250 --> 40:19.410
Duke.

40:35.726 --> 40:39.139
-Where is she?
-Where is who?

40:39.688 --> 40:40.928
Audrey.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.598
-What did you do with her?
-She's missing?

40:45.444 --> 40:48.436
Nathan, I swear I didn't do anything to her.

40:48.989 --> 40:51.947
-You were in her apartment.
-No, lwasn't.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.540
Now, think. Think.

41:04.004 --> 41:06.837
-Why would I hurt Audrey?
-You got five seconds.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.047
Four

41:10.135 --> 41:12.171
Nathan, if I was gonna hurt her...

41:12.262 --> 41:14.469
-Three.
-...I would have been waiting for you.

41:30.447 --> 41:32.108
I'm done counting.

41:33.575 --> 41:34.610
