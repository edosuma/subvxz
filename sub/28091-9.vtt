before it collapsed
and killed 47 people.

mentioned it to the company

36:30.099 --> 36:31.816
Huh, all right.

36:34.196 --> 36:35.374
Do you mind?

36:35.399 --> 36:36.578
Yeah, yeah, please, go ahead.

36:36.603 --> 36:37.735
Thank you.

36:37.969 --> 36:39.008
Woah, woah, woah.

36:39.033 --> 36:41.499
I can see why you had
trouble tying the tie.

36:41.524 --> 36:42.914
Here, let me give you a hand.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.871
- Okay.
- Oh boy.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.602
You can do this.

36:46.627 --> 36:47.699
Good luck.

36:47.724 --> 36:49.090
All right.

36:51.337 --> 36:53.212
[GIGGLING]

37:00.272 --> 37:01.873
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

37:01.898 --> 37:03.180
We're running low on cider, I just...

37:03.205 --> 37:04.327
It's gonna happen.

37:04.352 --> 37:05.413
[GASPS]

37:05.438 --> 37:06.504
Yeah.

37:06.529 --> 37:08.852
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.347
Will you dance with me?

37:14.372 --> 37:16.258
Certainly. [GIGGLES]

37:16.283 --> 37:17.641
No.

37:18.293 --> 37:20.030
I mean...

37:21.514 --> 37:23.681
For the rest of your life?

37:27.840 --> 37:29.513
[GASPS]

37:29.867 --> 37:32.125
You've been as patient as a saint.

37:32.572 --> 37:37.548
And I promise I will never stop
trying to deserve your love.

37:38.679 --> 37:40.135
Clara...

37:42.998 --> 37:44.890
Will you be my wife?

37:48.471 --> 37:52.062
[GASPS]

37:53.036 --> 37:56.081
Well, I haven't been working
two jobs not to be your wife.

37:56.209 --> 37:57.561
[LAUGHS]

37:57.602 --> 37:59.026
Yes.

38:07.699 --> 38:09.299
[LAUGHS]

38:09.324 --> 38:10.566
We're engaged!

38:10.737 --> 38:17.338
[APPLAUSE]

38:20.753 --> 38:22.724
Whoo!

38:31.591 --> 38:33.935
- Yeah, good man.
- It's about time.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.093
Thanks, Bill.

38:35.118 --> 38:36.857
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Carson.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.317
You are one lucky man.

38:40.136 --> 38:41.849
Luckiest man on the face of the earth.

38:41.874 --> 38:42.749
So, what are you doing here?

38:42.774 --> 38:44.741
Go dance with her.

38:44.918 --> 38:46.317
<i>Fiona?!</i>

38:47.952 --> 38:50.779
I just wanted to say thank
you for all of your help

38:50.804 --> 38:52.304
with the Founders' Day Festival.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.054
- Oh, you're welcome.
- It was fun.

38:54.079 --> 38:55.484
Really, was it?

38:55.509 --> 38:56.804
It wasn't too crazy?

38:56.829 --> 39:00.998
No, in fact, I was thinking we
should shake it up even more.

39:01.163 --> 39:03.008
Well, what were you thinking?

39:03.332 --> 39:06.270
Have you ever heard of "Ladies Choice"?

39:06.295 --> 39:08.889
[LAUGHING] Oh, yes!

39:13.161 --> 39:15.395
I got a wonderful idea.

39:20.822 --> 39:23.570
- This song.
- Oh, that one, yeah.

39:25.578 --> 39:27.345
Everyone, we're going to do something

39:27.370 --> 39:29.236
<i>a little different now.</i>

39:29.347 --> 39:30.679
<i>The next song will be...</i>

39:30.704 --> 39:31.936
Oh, no.

39:31.961 --> 39:34.028
Ladies' choice.

39:34.053 --> 39:38.752
So ladies, pick your dance partner.

39:50.291 --> 39:52.099
Ned?

40:08.426 --> 40:10.043
I should check in on Lee.

40:10.068 --> 40:11.993
Absolutely.

40:16.531 --> 40:19.835
[BOTH LAUGH]

40:20.231 --> 40:21.731
So funny.

40:21.756 --> 40:23.713
So funny.

40:37.795 --> 40:39.729
Would you like to dance?

40:40.471 --> 40:42.107
Absolutely.
