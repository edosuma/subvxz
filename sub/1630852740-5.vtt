about that nose?"

00:32.119 --> 00:34.250
annoyed and said, "I've tried."

I've seen over 20 doctors.

They've all said

00:37.060 --> 00:39.039
they can't help me.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.189
They said

I have three consistent

There are ones that

02:05.180 --> 02:07.099
they back down.

02:07.099 --> 02:09.060
And I don't settle.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.080
I grew up in

02:09.060 --> 02:11.080
the very small town of Monrovia

02:11.080 --> 02:14.159
in the not-so-great state

02:11.080 --> 02:14.159
of Indiana.

02:14.159 --> 02:16.219
To the left, I would look

02:14.159 --> 02:16.219
and there was a cornfield,

02:16.219 --> 02:18.180
and to the right,

02:16.219 --> 02:18.180
there would be a tractor.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.099
I mean, hello,

02:18.180 --> 02:21.099
I don't think I fit in there.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.180
So I kind of just cultivated

02:21.099 --> 02:23.180
this Barbie fantasy around me.

02:23.180 --> 02:26.050
I want to look like

02:23.180 --> 02:26.050
a doll with full lips.

02:26.050 --> 02:30.060
So, I'd had three rounds of lip

02:26.050 --> 02:30.060
filler when I was 17-years-old.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.250
And when I turned 18,

02:30.060 --> 02:32.250
I moved to L.A.

02:32.250 --> 02:35.079
because, I mean,

02:32.250 --> 02:35.079
it's the land of plastics.

02:35.079 --> 02:37.120
You can really smell

02:35.079 --> 02:37.120
the silicone in the air,

02:37.120 --> 02:39.060
so it's where

02:37.120 --> 02:39.060
I'm meant to be.

02:39.060 --> 02:42.079
I got my hideous nose done

02:39.060 --> 02:42.079
when I moved to L.A.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.219
That was absolutely amazing.

02:44.219 --> 02:47.150
I think normally

02:44.219 --> 02:47.150
people get a tattoo at 18.

02:47.150 --> 02:49.090
I got a rhinoplasty

02:47.150 --> 02:49.090
at 18.

02:49.090 --> 02:52.060
And then the injections started

02:49.090 --> 02:52.060
from there.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.159
I have under eye filler,

02:52.060 --> 02:54.159
cheek filler, jawline filler.

02:54.159 --> 02:57.110
So much Kybella, like you

02:54.159 --> 02:57.110

02:59.060 --> 03:01.189
I definitely have branded myself

02:59.060 --> 03:01.189
around my lips.

03:01.189 --> 03:03.150
But it's becoming a problem

03:03.150 --> 03:05.099
because I'm getting them done

03:03.150 --> 03:05.099
so often,

03:05.099 --> 03:07.250
there's some nerve damage

03:05.099 --> 03:07.250

03:10.139 --> 03:12.150

03:39.110 --> 03:41.229
and after three surgeries,

03:41.229 --> 03:43.199
my nose looks like

03:41.229 --> 03:43.199
I'm smashed against the window,

03:43.199 --> 03:45.259

03:45.259 --> 03:49.090
like I'm smushed

[chuckling]

04:19.069 --> 04:20.189
I was so excited

04:19.069 --> 04:20.189
for that surgery

04:20.189 --> 04:23.100
that we had

04:20.189 --> 04:23.100
a before-picture party.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.220
I have side profiles,

04:23.100 --> 04:25.220
and we have front profiles.

04:25.220 --> 04:28.120
And we were supposed

04:25.220 --> 04:28.120
to have an after-party

04:28.120 --> 04:31.069
to see when the new princess

04:28.120 --> 04:31.069
is going to come out.

04:31.069 --> 04:33.189
But then after

04:31.069 --> 04:33.189
the first surgery,

04:33.189 --> 04:35.120
the hump went from

04:33.189 --> 04:35.120
a huge hump

04:35.120 --> 04:37.180
to just a little bit less

04:35.120 --> 04:37.180
of a bigger hump.

04:37.180 --> 04:41.079
And so throughout the first

04:37.180 --> 04:41.079
surgery, the second surgery,

04:41.079 --> 04:43.269
the third surgery,

04:41.079 --> 04:43.269
I've never been able to take

04:43.269 --> 04:47.139

04:51.250 --> 04:53.250

04:53.250 --> 04:56.120

Yeah, I didn't complain

05:07.079 --> 05:08.250
that much

05:08.250 --> 05:11.079
because I was able to be

I can't do any of that stuff

05:16.230 --> 05:19.220
with my husband any more

05:19.220 --> 05:21.100
because I can't keep up

05:19.220 --> 05:21.100
with him.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.279
And he's ten years older

05:21.100 --> 05:22.279
than me.

05:23.079 --> 05:25.050
My nose is limiting that

05:25.050 --> 05:28.170
to where we can't have fun

05:25.050 --> 05:28.170
together the way we used to.

05:28.170 --> 05:31.120

07:06.209 --> 07:10.069
can't fix me, that's it.

07:10.069 --> 07:12.120
Because if they can't do it,

07:10.069 --> 07:12.120
nobody else can.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.139
I'm terrified,

07:12.120 --> 07:14.139

So tell us your story.

07:23.139 --> 07:25.230
So when I was nine,

07:23.139 --> 07:25.230
I looked like a parrot.

07:25.230 --> 07:27.129
It was beaked.

07:27.129 --> 07:29.189
And then I had open surgery

07:27.129 --> 07:29.189
at 13 years old.

07:29.189 --> 07:31.129
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:31.129 --> 07:33.189
So you had an open rhinoplasty

07:31.129 --> 07:33.189
at the age of 13.

07:33.189 --> 07:35.240
Was there any talk about

07:33.189 --> 07:35.240
"Maybe this is a little young?

07:35.240 --> 07:37.189
You haven't

07:35.240 --> 07:37.189

07:37.189 --> 07:40.149
In my opinion,

07:37.189 --> 07:40.149
13 years of age is too young

07:40.149 --> 07:42.269
to have

07:40.149 --> 07:42.269
cosmetic nasal surgery.

07:42.269 --> 07:44.250
So how did that surgery

07:42.269 --> 07:44.250
turn out?

07:44.250 --> 07:46.079
It was wide.

07:46.079 --> 07:48.040
It was already collapsed,

07:46.079 --> 07:48.040
really wide.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.220
So I had my second surgery.

07:49.220 --> 07:53.199
And within a week

07:49.220 --> 07:53.199
of the surgery,

07:53.199 --> 07:56.209
As I was writing something,

07:53.199 --> 07:56.209
I'm like, "What are you doing?"

07:56.209 --> 07:58.279
And she popped her head up

07:56.209 --> 07:58.279
and head butted me and-

07:58.279 --> 08:00.149
-Hard?

07:58.279 --> 08:00.149
-Yeah.

08:00.149 --> 08:01.259
-Bleed?

08:00.149 --> 08:01.259
-Yeah.

08:01.259 --> 08:03.199
Oh my God.

08:03.199 --> 08:05.199
And I went to

08:03.199 --> 08:05.199
the doctor and they said,

08:05.199 --> 08:07.089
"There's nothing

08:05.199 --> 08:07.089
we can do about that."

08:07.089 --> 08:08.290
So, that was

08:07.089 --> 08:08.290
the second one, at 17.

08:08.290 --> 08:11.019
So the third one,

08:08.290 --> 08:11.019
at 24.

08:11.019 --> 08:13.170
Right away after that surgery,

08:11.019 --> 08:13.170

08:13.170 --> 08:15.189

08:15.189 --> 08:17.089

And it gets really tricky,

08:32.190 --> 08:35.000
especially my left nostril

08:35.000 --> 08:37.059
because I have, like,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.059

11:30.279 --> 11:33.269
not reversible.

11:33.269 --> 11:36.049
Okay, so

11:33.269 --> 11:36.049
I'm going to do something,

11:36.049 --> 11:38.279
then you're gonna tell me

11:36.049 --> 11:38.279
how you feel, all right?

11:38.279 --> 11:41.029
That actually feels good.

11:41.029 --> 11:42.210
-It does?

11:41.029 --> 11:42.210
-Mm-hm.

11:42.210 --> 11:44.019
Now, there

11:42.210 --> 11:44.019
is an interesting thing.

11:44.019 --> 11:46.019
If you read medical books

11:44.019 --> 11:46.019
about what to do

11:46.019 --> 11:47.269
with Empty Nose Syndrome,

11:47.269 --> 11:49.220
they never talk about making

11:47.269 --> 11:49.220
your airway bigger.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.200
Our dictum of learning is

11:49.220 --> 11:51.200
"Don't make it bigger."

11:51.200 --> 11:54.090
However,

11:51.200 --> 11:54.090
in about 10 patients

11:54.090 --> 11:56.009
in the last seven years,

11:56.009 --> 11:57.210
I've put grafts

11:56.009 --> 11:57.210
in the nose

11:57.210 --> 12:00.049
and I've tried to emulate

11:57.210 --> 12:00.049
what I just did.

12:00.049 --> 12:02.059
I was getting it, like,

12:00.049 --> 12:02.059
air was actually going in.

12:02.059 --> 12:03.259
You felt air going in.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.210
Yes, like, okay,

12:03.259 --> 12:05.210
I'm getting a breath.

12:05.210 --> 12:08.220
It actually worked on

12:05.210 --> 12:08.220
all 10 people.

12:08.220 --> 12:11.240
Paul and I have to come up

12:08.220 --> 12:11.240
with unique solutions

12:11.240 --> 12:13.230
to nearly impossible problems.

12:13.230 --> 12:17.279
So the fact that he's done

12:13.230 --> 12:17.279
this unique operation 10 times,

12:17.279 --> 12:21.009
and it's been successful 10 out

12:17.279 --> 12:21.009
of 10 is pretty good evidence

12:21.009 --> 12:24.200
that he's probably the only one

12:21.009 --> 12:24.200
who can achieve this outcome.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.039
And it may be worth

12:24.200 --> 12:27.039
considering in Yesenia.

12:27.039 --> 12:30.259
99.999%  of doctors won't

12:27.039 --> 12:30.259
even think about doing this.

12:30.259 --> 12:34.000
I would basically

12:30.259 --> 12:34.000
make your profile better.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.009
From the front, get

12:34.000 --> 12:38.009
your nose straight, God willing.

12:38.009 --> 12:39.279
Amor.

12:39.279 --> 12:41.240
But here's the tricky part.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.230
I'd have to put

12:41.240 --> 12:43.230
big pieces of cartilage here,

12:43.230 --> 12:45.269
and they're pieces of rib

12:43.230 --> 12:45.269
and they're long,

12:45.269 --> 12:48.230
and usually they're strong

12:45.269 --> 12:48.230
to open up your valves.

12:48.230 --> 12:50.120
But, if we say,

12:48.230 --> 12:50.120
let's go for it,

12:50.120 --> 12:52.039
you could be the 11th person

12:50.120 --> 12:52.039
who says,

12:52.039 --> 12:54.090
"Hey, you just made me

12:52.039 --> 12:54.090
worse."

12:54.090 --> 12:56.049
[nervous laughter]

12:56.049 --> 12:57.110
Do you want to try it?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.080
Only with you.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.220
11, just so you know,

12:59.080 --> 13:02.220
that's always my lucky number,

13:02.220 --> 13:04.029
I hope I'm 11.

13:04.029 --> 13:05.279
[refined trap music]

13:05.279 --> 13:07.190
[leather thudding]

13:07.190 --> 13:10.029
Come on, the dunk-um,

13:07.190 --> 13:10.029
get that big booty.

13:10.029 --> 13:11.279
My name is

13:10.029 --> 13:11.279
Tekeema.

13:11.279 --> 13:13.269
My group of friends called

13:11.279 --> 13:13.269
my butt "the dunk-um"

13:13.269 --> 13:15.289
because it looks like

13:13.269 --> 13:15.289
an uneven pair of basketballs.

13:15.289 --> 13:18.259
bouncing around back there,

13:15.289 --> 13:18.259
that are getting dunked.

13:18.259 --> 13:20.100
[quiet giggling]

13:20.100 --> 13:22.029
Uh, hey dunk-um!

13:22.029 --> 13:23.259
It's weighin'

13:22.029 --> 13:23.259
me down!

13:23.259 --> 13:25.149
All my life,

13:23.259 --> 13:25.149
I've struggled with my weight.

13:25.149 --> 13:27.220
I remember

13:25.149 --> 13:27.220
I was in fourth grade,

13:27.220 --> 13:29.279
other kids were like,

13:27.220 --> 13:29.279
"How much do you weigh?"

13:29.279 --> 13:32.070
And everybody's like,

13:29.279 --> 13:32.070
"I weigh 79,"

13:32.070 --> 13:34.080
"I weigh 89",

13:32.070 --> 13:34.080
And I'm like, "150."

13:34.080 --> 13:36.090
They're like,

13:34.080 --> 13:36.090
"you weigh as much as our mom."

13:36.090 --> 13:38.090
[laughing]

13:38.090 --> 13:41.090
I laugh about it now, but it was

13:38.090 --> 13:41.090
heartbreaking then, you know?

13:41.090 --> 13:44.039
At some point

13:41.090 --> 13:44.039
I weighed 268 pounds.

13:44.039 --> 13:47.049
I think that's

13:44.039 --> 13:47.049
when the lights came on,

13:47.049 --> 13:49.000
like I needed

13:47.049 --> 13:49.000
to do something.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.090
There were people that knew me

13:49.000 --> 13:51.090
in the family were like,

13:51.090 --> 13:52.240
"Oh wow,

13:51.090 --> 13:52.240
you're getting skinny, right?"

13:52.240 --> 13:54.059
I'm 199 pounds.

13:54.059 --> 13:56.029
And, about three years ago,

13:56.029 --> 13:58.009
I lost some more weight.

13:58.009 --> 14:00.009
But then I started noticing

13:58.009 --> 14:00.009
my skin was really flabby,

14:00.009 --> 14:03.070
and so I decided to go down

14:00.009 --> 14:03.070
to Mexico and get surgery.

14:03.070 --> 14:06.279
And then the whole process

14:03.070 --> 14:06.279
went awry

14:06.279 --> 14:09.090
when I was left

14:06.279 --> 14:09.090
with a supersized butt.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.039
Ouch.

14:11.039 --> 14:13.090
Come on.

14:11.039 --> 14:13.090
Get it, you can do it.

14:13.090 --> 14:15.129
It feels like I'm being, like,

14:13.090 --> 14:15.129
poked really, really hard,

14:15.129 --> 14:17.210
and it hurts really,

14:15.129 --> 14:17.210
really bad.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.039
So I had the butt implants

14:17.210 --> 14:20.039
put in about three years ago.

14:20.039 --> 14:22.100
I literally feel like I

14:20.039 --> 14:22.100
am pulling a trailer behind me.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.080
My quality of life

14:22.100 --> 14:24.080
has been taken from me.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.259
I can't take the pain any more

14:24.080 --> 14:26.259
and definitely not the size.

14:26.259 --> 14:28.259
Get rid of that dunk-um.

14:26.259 --> 14:28.259
Get rid of that... torpedo.

14:28.259 --> 14:33.070
Tekeema. Tekeema.

14:33.070 --> 14:36.019
So take us back to

14:33.070 --> 14:36.019
how you got here,

14:36.019 --> 14:39.009
because I know that you

14:36.019 --> 14:39.009
have lost a bunch of weight.

14:39.009 --> 14:40.289
What did you do?

14:39.009 --> 14:40.289
What happened?

14:40.289 --> 14:43.149
About three years ago,

14:40.289 --> 14:43.149
I wanted a tummy tuck.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.279
Okay.

14:44.279 --> 14:46.120
Uh-uh, so I had a friend,

14:46.120 --> 14:48.120
you know and I have

14:46.120 --> 14:48.120
a friend of a friend.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.149
She's like, "You know,

14:48.120 --> 14:50.149
I have an aunt in Mexico

14:50.149 --> 14:52.110
who's done all this stuff!

14:52.110 --> 14:54.110
She really knows there's

14:52.110 --> 14:54.110
a great plastic surgeon there."

14:54.110 --> 14:55.269
Yeah, word of mouth.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.110
Yeah, so,

14:55.269 --> 14:57.110
we go down to Mexico.

14:57.110 --> 14:59.090
He does the consult.

14:59.090 --> 15:01.159
He said "you'll kind of

14:59.090 --> 15:01.159
get more bang for your buck,

15:01.159 --> 15:03.039
if you went

15:01.159 --> 15:03.039
all the way around."

15:03.039 --> 15:04.259
Circumferential body lift.

15:04.259 --> 15:06.080
But you didn't

15:04.259 --> 15:06.080
go there complaining

15:06.080 --> 15:07.259
-about the backside at all.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.259
-No.

15:07.259 --> 15:09.049
Just the front.

15:07.259 --> 15:09.049
So this... gentleman.

15:09.049 --> 15:11.039
-Gentleman?

15:09.049 --> 15:11.039
-Gentleman, yeah.

15:11.039 --> 15:13.070
...decided to sort of have

15:11.039 --> 15:13.070
you consider adding things on.

15:13.070 --> 15:14.269
A while-you're-there

15:13.070 --> 15:14.269
situation.

15:14.269 --> 15:17.019
So they did sort

15:14.269 --> 15:17.019
of thigh lift, tummy tuck,

15:17.019 --> 15:20.129
buttock lift, back lift,

15:17.019 --> 15:20.129
everything at once.

15:20.129 --> 15:23.250
Yes. He used this word,

15:20.129 --> 15:23.250
autogenus- something tissue

15:23.250 --> 15:25.029
from my tummy tuck.

15:25.029 --> 15:26.269
So, autologous fat transfer.

15:26.269 --> 15:28.039
There you go. Yes.

15:28.039 --> 15:29.240
So that's

15:28.039 --> 15:29.240
a Brazilian butt lift.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.179
Mh-hm.

15:31.179 --> 15:34.169
But it did not look the way that

15:31.179 --> 15:34.169
I thought it was gonna look.

15:34.169 --> 15:36.100
The skin became flaccid,

15:36.100 --> 15:38.090
and kind of a dent

15:36.100 --> 15:38.090
on the lower buttock,

15:38.090 --> 15:40.120
but I didn't have before.

15:38.090 --> 15:40.120
.How did the tummy look?

15:40.120 --> 15:42.009
-I really did love my stomach.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.009
-Beautiful.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.039
I really did,

15:42.009 --> 15:44.039
I love my stomach.

15:44.039 --> 15:45.279
Well, if you heal like this,

15:44.039 --> 15:45.279
you're basically favouring

15:45.279 --> 15:47.169
-this over that, right?

15:45.279 --> 15:47.169
-Oh, over that?

15:47.169 --> 15:49.269
In general,

15:47.169 --> 15:49.269
if you're doing a tummy tuck,

15:49.269 --> 15:51.279
you don't want to do

15:49.269 --> 15:51.279
a buttock procedure

15:51.279 --> 15:55.059
because you've got to lie flat

15:51.279 --> 15:55.059
on your buttock

15:55.059 --> 15:57.120
while you're recovering

15:55.059 --> 15:57.120
from the tummy tuck.

15:57.120 --> 16:02.090
Or you lie on your stomach

15:57.120 --> 16:02.090
to allow your buttock to heal.

16:02.090 --> 16:05.100
Either way,

16:02.090 --> 16:05.100
one of them is being disrupted,

16:05.100 --> 16:08.279
and that may be exactly

16:05.100 --> 16:08.279
what happened in Tekeema's case.

16:08.279 --> 16:11.009
So they were gonna do

16:08.279 --> 16:11.009
a revision on you.

16:11.009 --> 16:14.019
He said that he would be able

16:11.009 --> 16:14.019
to use fat to fill up the area,

16:14.019 --> 16:15.100
to give me

16:14.019 --> 16:15.100
some more fullness.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.259
Okay.

16:16.259 --> 16:18.169
And I'm actually

16:16.259 --> 16:18.169
in pre-op area.

16:18.169 --> 16:20.190
The assistant comes in,

16:18.169 --> 16:20.190
and begins to tell me

16:20.190 --> 16:24.090
the doctor has concerns

16:20.190 --> 16:24.090
that I don't have enough fat.

16:24.090 --> 16:26.120
And so he has suggested

16:24.090 --> 16:26.120
I use an implant.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.120
This is right before

16:28.100 --> 16:30.120
going in the operating room?

16:30.120 --> 16:32.000
-Yes.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.000
-Moments before surgery?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.139
-Moments before surgery.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.139
-Red flag.

16:34.139 --> 16:38.090
That's an absolute

16:34.139 --> 16:38.090
no-no in plastic surgery.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.090
Okay, so they took you in

16:38.090 --> 16:40.090
to do buttock implants-

16:40.090 --> 16:42.049
-Mh-hm.

16:40.090 --> 16:42.049
-And...?

16:42.049 --> 16:44.129
I mean, the right side

16:42.049 --> 16:44.129
looked way better than the left.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.059
But the left side

16:44.129 --> 16:46.059
was definitely-

16:46.059 --> 16:47.179
Something was wrong.

16:47.179 --> 16:49.080
You can still

16:47.179 --> 16:49.080
see the irregularity.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.019
Yes, yes!

16:51.019 --> 16:52.269
And now you just have

16:51.019 --> 16:52.269
two buttock implants

16:52.269 --> 16:54.100
and the irregularity.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.049
Yes. So then about

16:54.100 --> 16:56.049
seven, eight months ago,

16:56.049 --> 16:57.269
I started to notice,

16:56.049 --> 16:57.269
like, this pain.

16:57.269 --> 16:59.269
Like, almost like in my hip area

16:57.269 --> 16:59.269
around the side.

16:59.269 --> 17:02.009
And then I would notice that

16:59.269 --> 17:02.009
my leg would fall asleep.

17:02.009 --> 17:03.179
Okay, so it's compressing

34:32.219 --> 34:35.030
maybe I can

34:32.219 --> 34:35.030
get some volume.

34:35.030 --> 34:37.130
Since Tekeema doesn't have

34:35.030 --> 34:37.130
enough fat in her lower back

34:37.130 --> 34:39.159
to rotate down

34:37.130 --> 34:39.159
to give her projection,

34:39.159 --> 34:42.030
what I'm going to do

34:39.159 --> 34:42.030
is take her tissue

34:42.030 --> 34:45.130
and then find a way

34:42.030 --> 34:45.130
to fold it on itself

34:45.130 --> 34:48.179

34:45.130 --> 34:48.179

40:16.119 --> 40:18.099
but that is symmetrical.

40:18.099 --> 40:20.210
And the pain

40:18.099 --> 40:20.210
and the dent are so gone.

40:20.210 --> 40:24.000
Dr. Dubrow is

40:20.210 --> 40:24.000
the dunk-um MVP of surgery.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.280
We should call him

40:24.000 --> 40:26.280
Dunk-Um Dubrow!

40:26.280 --> 40:28.179
I was a little worried

40:26.280 --> 40:28.179
about you

40:28.179 --> 40:30.010
because after

40:28.179 --> 40:30.010
you came out of surgery,

40:30.010 --> 40:32.110
you kept talking about how

40:32.110 --> 40:34.219
you felt like it wasn't going

40:32.110 --> 40:34.219
to project, you had a pancake.

40:34.219 --> 40:36.099
You was really worried about it.

40:36.099 --> 40:38.130
I'm glad you were

40:36.099 --> 40:38.130
able to get through that.

40:38.130 --> 40:41.239
And it's good to see you,

40:38.130 --> 40:41.239
I mean, looking better.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.210
And feeling better.

40:43.210 --> 40:46.110
Overall, I'm just happy

40:43.210 --> 40:46.110
this whole journey is done.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.250
We can put it to rest.

40:47.250 --> 40:49.159
The booty is gone,

40:47.250 --> 40:49.159
and this new Tekeema

40:49.159 --> 40:50.230
with the new booty

40:49.159 --> 40:50.230
is here.

40:50.230 --> 40:52.110
Dunk-um's in the dumpster.

40:52.110 --> 40:54.019
I never want to see

40:52.110 --> 40:54.019
a doctor's office

40:54.019 --> 40:56.130
unless I'm having to walk

40:54.019 --> 40:56.130
in there for a common cold.

40:56.130 --> 40:58.170
I won't be going

40:56.130 --> 40:58.170
in there for any sign

40:58.170 --> 40:59.289
of plastic surgery

40:58.170 --> 40:59.289
ever again, for sure.

40:59.289 --> 41:01.190
You feel comfortable

40:59.289 --> 41:01.190
that this is it?

41:01.190 --> 41:03.139
Scout's honour,

41:03.139 --> 41:05.099
is that the right sign

41:03.139 --> 41:05.099
to say scout's honour?

41:05.099 --> 41:06.190
[whooshing]

41:06.190 --> 41:09.099
[slow drum beat]

41:09.099 --> 41:11.010
DANIEL:

41:09.099 --> 41:11.010
I can't believe this!

41:11.010 --> 41:13.019
Again, try to catch up.

41:13.019 --> 41:15.000
Wow. Woo!

41:15.000 --> 41:17.130
I've never known what it's

41:15.000 --> 41:17.130
like to have a normal nose

41:17.130 --> 41:19.159
and just knowing what

41:17.130 --> 41:19.159
it feels like to breathe.

41:19.159 --> 41:21.019
It's weird.

41:21.019 --> 41:23.030
It almost feels like,

41:21.019 --> 41:23.030
it's the end of having

41:23.030 --> 41:25.199
all those ugly feelings

41:23.030 --> 41:25.199
about my nose, and myself,

41:25.199 --> 41:27.179
and the things

41:25.199 --> 41:27.179
that I could or couldn't do.

41:27.179 --> 41:29.219
And it's the beginning

41:27.179 --> 41:29.219
of just feeling light.

41:29.219 --> 41:33.019
♪ It feels

41:29.219 --> 41:33.019
like a dream, oh ♪

41:33.019 --> 41:36.199
♪ It feels like a dream ♪

41:36.199 --> 41:38.260
I actually feel

41:36.199 --> 41:38.260
beautiful for the first time.

41:38.260 --> 41:41.159
And, I can run circles

41:38.260 --> 41:41.159
around my husband.

41:41.159 --> 41:43.110
Think we could

41:41.159 --> 41:43.110
do this more often.

41:43.110 --> 41:45.170
Instead of me sitting at

41:43.110 --> 41:45.170
a bench waiting for you guys

41:45.170 --> 41:47.179
and giving you

41:45.170 --> 41:47.179
your drinks,

41:47.179 --> 41:49.239
you guys are just going

41:47.179 --> 41:49.239
to have to eat my dust.

41:49.239 --> 41:51.179
-That's what's going to happen.

41:49.239 --> 41:51.179
-NICHOLAS: Goodness!

41:51.179 --> 41:54.039
Before my surgery,

41:51.179 --> 41:54.039
my nose looked like

41:54.039 --> 41:56.170
I was smashed

41:54.039 --> 41:56.170
against a window.

41:56.170 --> 41:59.179
I was unable to breathe

41:56.170 --> 41:59.179
properly, and I couldn't keep up

41:59.179 --> 42:01.260
with my husband

41:59.179 --> 42:01.260
who's 10 years older than me.

42:01.260 --> 42:05.190
But now, thanks to Dr. Nassif,

42:01.260 --> 42:05.190
my nose is straight

42:05.190 --> 42:09.199
and it just looks like the fairy

42:05.190 --> 42:09.199
tale ending I've always wanted.

42:09.199 --> 42:11.250
I'm no longer

42:09.199 --> 42:11.250
the one that's falling behind,

42:11.250 --> 42:13.219
but I'm the one

42:11.250 --> 42:13.219
that's leading the pack.

42:13.219 --> 42:15.199
I miss my slow buddy.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.269
You better

42:15.199 --> 42:17.269
start catching up, son.

42:17.269 --> 42:19.139
[laughing]

42:19.139 --> 42:20.289
DANIEL:

42:19.139 --> 42:20.289
Look at that profile!

42:20.289 --> 42:22.199
I love my profile!

42:20.289 --> 42:22.199
I'm feeling so good.

42:22.199 --> 42:24.050
And I wake up

42:22.199 --> 42:24.050
in a better mood.

42:24.050 --> 42:25.260
I'm not so tired.

42:24.050 --> 42:25.260
I feel rested.

42:25.260 --> 42:27.210
NICHOLAS:

42:25.260 --> 42:27.210
Yeah, I can tell.

42:27.210 --> 42:29.050
It's just

42:27.210 --> 42:29.050
so much has changed.

42:29.050 --> 42:30.230
You act different.

42:30.230 --> 42:32.219
-Oh yeah?

42:30.230 --> 42:32.219
-Yeah.

42:32.219 --> 42:34.219
Just more relaxed, a little

42:32.219 --> 42:34.219
bit more jokey than usual.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.050
It's really nice.

42:36.050 --> 42:37.269
How about we mark this

42:36.050 --> 42:37.269
new beginning

42:37.269 --> 42:39.199
with... a selfie.

42:39.199 --> 42:41.150
I remember when

42:39.199 --> 42:41.150
I was younger actually,

42:41.150 --> 42:43.030
she'd always be more loud,

42:41.150 --> 42:43.030
she'd be energetic,

42:43.030 --> 42:45.050
and like a little bit later

42:43.030 --> 42:45.050
when we got older,

42:45.050 --> 42:46.230
it started affecting

42:45.050 --> 42:46.230
her more, her nose.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.010
It started collapsing more.

42:48.010 --> 42:49.260
It started

42:48.010 --> 42:49.260
to get worse.

42:49.260 --> 42:51.239
But now after the surgery,

42:49.260 --> 42:51.239
again, it's pretty great.

42:51.239 --> 42:53.210
It's honestly great.

42:53.210 --> 42:55.280
Yeah, she's a lot more

42:53.210 --> 42:55.280
active now, I would say that.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.239
DANIEL:

42:55.280 --> 42:57.239
After pictures, right?

42:57.239 --> 42:59.190
Oh, yes, these are finally

42:57.239 --> 42:59.190
my "after" pictures!

42:59.190 --> 43:01.059
It feels so good

42:59.190 --> 43:01.059
to finally have

43:01.059 --> 43:04.239
my "after" pictures

43:01.059 --> 43:04.239
after 36 years.

43:04.239 --> 43:08.280
And the best thing is I took

43:04.239 --> 43:08.280
them with my husband, my sons,

43:08.280 --> 43:10.230
the people

43:08.280 --> 43:10.230
who I love the most.

43:10.230 --> 43:12.269
Say hello

43:10.230 --> 43:12.269
to the new nose!

43:12.269 --> 43:14.030
Welcome, my new nose!

43:14.030 --> 43:15.159
[speaking in Spanish]

43:15.159 --> 43:16.230
Hi nose!

43:16.230 --> 43:18.039
[whooshing]

43:18.039 --> 43:19.269
I have over 1,000 tattoos

43:18.039 --> 43:19.269
and counting.

43:19.269 --> 43:21.059
I have my eyes tattoo'd,

43:21.059 --> 43:23.039
I have scarification

43:21.059 --> 43:23.039
on my cheeks.

43:23.039 --> 43:26.000
I'm here to remove my nipples

43:23.039 --> 43:26.000
and my belly button.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.070
I didn't do any research.

43:28.170 --> 43:30.269
Now my breasts

43:28.170 --> 43:30.269
look deformed.

43:30.269 --> 43:33.050
I chose the doctor

43:30.269 --> 43:33.050
without the consultation fees.

43:33.050 --> 43:35.019
-We've heard that before.

43:33.050 --> 43:35.019
-Yes.

43:35.019 --> 43:36.250
I broke my nose as a kid

43:36.250 --> 43:38.219
and I've been wrestling

43:36.250 --> 43:38.219
with it ever since.

43:38.219 --> 43:40.230
I saw this billboard

43:38.219 --> 43:40.230
of this doctor.

43:40.230 --> 43:42.070
But he's on billboards?

43:42.070 --> 43:43.269
Another permanent stitch,

43:42.070 --> 43:43.269
spitting.

43:43.269 --> 43:46.239
This is something you don't do.

43:43.269 --> 43:46.239
[bleep]
