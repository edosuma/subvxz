17:37.902 --> 17:39.777
Tao: We've gone through
the timecode on the video,

17:39.777 --> 17:41.473
matching it to the corresponding points

17:41.516 --> 17:43.306
in the tire tracks from the crime scene.

17:43.306 --> 17:44.250
While they were arguing,

17:44.250 --> 17:46.815
the Cochrans drifted onto the
dirt shoulder of the road.

17:46.815 --> 17:50.189
If you watch, the first
swerve occurs right there

17:50.189 --> 17:52.718
at 4 minutes, 24 seconds into the race.

17:52.718 --> 17:55.225
Which corresponds to this
point in the tire tracks.

17:55.225 --> 17:57.523
The swerving continues for 10 seconds,

17:57.557 --> 18:01.586
as they fight for control, back
and forth, back and forth.

18:01.586 --> 18:04.307
But then, at the 4 minute, 34 second mark,

18:04.369 --> 18:06.495
the tire tracks go straight,

18:06.536 --> 18:08.982
directly towards the edge of the cliff.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.121
Whoosh!

18:10.121 --> 18:13.264
The Cochrans were definitely
not in control of their vehicle.

18:13.264 --> 18:14.782
For the last 20 yards, at least.

18:14.782 --> 18:18.185
So, either the steering wheels locked

18:18.669 --> 18:20.107
or they were hacked.

18:20.107 --> 18:22.508
S.I.D. is studying the car's computer now.

18:22.508 --> 18:24.547
We should have a report shortly.

18:24.588 --> 18:25.765
In the meantime, we need to find out

18:25.765 --> 18:28.971
who else had access to that
car before the challenge,

18:28.971 --> 18:31.384
and who would want the Cochrans dead.

18:31.384 --> 18:33.767
Wait, does this mean we need to
watch them on the television?

18:33.767 --> 18:35.139
I've got that covered.

18:39.148 --> 18:40.459
- Hey, Buzz.
- Lieutenant.

18:40.459 --> 18:42.585
The captain said you wanted something to do.

18:42.937 --> 18:44.202
Yeah?

18:44.578 --> 18:46.438
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

18:46.438 --> 18:49.884
Welcome to all three seasons of
"American Scavenger Hunt."

18:49.884 --> 18:51.186
Thank you.

18:51.186 --> 18:52.017
Enjoy.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here

19:01.813 --> 19:03.037
Flynn: Run, Reggie, run!

19:03.037 --> 19:05.114
It's in the freezer... Oh, my God.

19:05.114 --> 19:07.314
How can you walk away from the refrigerator

19:07.352 --> 19:09.056
and not open the freezer?

19:10.061 --> 19:11.122
Sorry about that.

19:11.122 --> 19:12.395
Hmm. It's okay.

19:12.554 --> 19:14.651
They love that show in prison, too.

19:14.943 --> 19:16.176
Look, how about this?

19:16.210 --> 19:17.294
I have a motion to suppress

19:17.294 --> 19:18.805
Greg's confession in court tomorrow.

19:18.805 --> 19:20.259
I thought you tried that already.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.256
Three times. Four is about average.

19:23.063 --> 19:25.868
Anyway, I'll arrange for you
to videotape an interview

19:25.868 --> 19:27.421
with Slider before his hearing,

19:27.421 --> 19:29.918
and then later you devote another post

19:29.918 --> 19:31.746
of this little show of yours, "Identity,"

19:31.746 --> 19:34.923
to a conversation with me
about the death penalty.

19:36.317 --> 19:37.849
Well, as a... as a journalist,

19:37.849 --> 19:39.922
I'd have to challenge everything you say.

19:39.922 --> 19:41.495
I can handle that debate.

19:42.279 --> 19:43.566
Agreed?

19:43.985 --> 19:46.174
Oh, my God, the penguin is in the freezer!

19:46.174 --> 19:47.130
Read the clue again!

19:47.130 --> 19:48.998
I mean, where do they find these people?

19:48.998 --> 19:51.822
Can I ask, are you representing Slider

19:51.822 --> 19:53.985
or your political cause?

19:54.415 --> 19:55.660
Oh, no.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.345
You have to interview Greg
before you can interview me.

19:59.881 --> 20:01.092
Deal?

20:02.852 --> 20:03.636
Ah.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.845
<i>These teams made a pact with the devil</i>

20:05.845 --> 20:07.496
<i>just going on that show.</i>

20:07.496 --> 20:09.484
<i>They all knew that they
were gonna be competing</i>

20:09.484 --> 20:11.330
<i>against the Cochrans when they auditioned.</i>

20:11.330 --> 20:14.611
But we were talking about Episode 9!

20:14.611 --> 20:15.528
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

20:15.578 --> 20:18.500
That's where Colleen stepped up her game.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.381
Colleen Dickhoof, sir?

20:20.381 --> 20:21.452
Colleen

20:21.452 --> 20:22.830
<i>Dickerhoof.</i>

20:22.830 --> 20:25.147
There's an "er" between the "dick"

20:25.147 --> 20:26.584
and the "hoof," Julio.

20:26.584 --> 20:28.449
And her husband's name is Les.

20:28.808 --> 20:30.057
Colleen and Les were the couple

20:30.057 --> 20:31.110
who were giving the interview

20:31.110 --> 20:32.899
when we got to the hospital, ma'am.

20:32.937 --> 20:34.509
Well, she seems nice.

20:34.509 --> 20:36.517
<i>Oh, yeah, sure. On the surface.</i>

20:36.517 --> 20:38.171
<i>Underneath, she's a snake...</i>

20:38.171 --> 20:39.714
<i>Making passes at all the men,</i>

20:39.714 --> 20:41.795
<i>getting each guy to play
off against the other.</i>

20:41.795 --> 20:43.246
In Episode 9,

20:43.246 --> 20:44.833
Colleen gets her hooks

20:44.833 --> 20:47.109
in the last two husbands on the show.

20:47.109 --> 20:49.995
That would be... Dr. Reggie Fluke,

20:49.995 --> 20:52.454
a computer engineer with sleep apnea,

20:52.454 --> 20:54.427
<i>and Chip Cochran.</i>

20:54.427 --> 20:55.971
Colleen was flirting with Chip, too?

20:55.988 --> 20:57.720
<i>On camera in front of her husband.</i>

20:57.720 --> 20:59.073
<i>I mean, besides the interviews</i>

20:59.111 --> 21:00.350
<i>they do with the contestants,</i>

21:00.350 --> 21:01.931
that was the best part of the show.

21:01.931 --> 21:04.360
One minute, this black widow

21:04.360 --> 21:06.273
<i>is making eyes with Reggie,</i>

21:06.273 --> 21:08.323
<i>and the next, she's winking at Chip.</i>

21:08.323 --> 21:09.543
<i>So how does all this</i>

21:09.543 --> 21:12.581
<i>extracurricular romance affect the game?</i>

21:12.581 --> 21:14.247
Because, before they give you a clue

21:14.247 --> 21:17.115
to track down whatever crazy-ass
item they want you to find,

21:17.576 --> 21:20.670
<i>each team must complete a challenge.</i>

21:20.670 --> 21:22.171
<i>And this Dickerhoof woman,</i>

21:22.171 --> 21:24.100
<i>she got Chip so psyched out</i>

21:24.100 --> 21:27.459
<i>that he tells her on camera
that he sabotaged Reggie...</i>

21:27.491 --> 21:28.677
You know, the computer geek...

21:28.677 --> 21:30.377
<i>And that he made him so late</i>

21:30.377 --> 21:33.270
<i>that the Doctor and Mrs.
Fluke could never catch up.</i>

21:33.270 --> 21:36.556
And then Chip and Donna drove over a cliff.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.029
<i>I'm telling you, it's the Dickerhoofs.</i>

21:38.029 --> 21:41.654
Wait, wait. When you
refer to them as a couple,

21:41.654 --> 21:44.925
shouldn't it be "Dickerhooves"?

21:45.249 --> 21:47.416
♪

21:48.182 --> 21:49.234
Sharon: Okay.

21:50.161 --> 21:51.197
So, how do we know

21:51.197 --> 21:53.848
if Colleen's flirtations were real

21:53.886 --> 21:56.158
or faked for the show?

21:56.158 --> 21:58.280
Chip: [ Chuckles ] It was real all right.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.857
Colleen, she got in my head, you know?

22:01.042 --> 22:03.107
We understand she's a manipulator.

22:03.107 --> 22:04.661
<i>But it never went anywhere.</i>

22:04.661 --> 22:06.334
<i>I was attracted to her, sure.</i>

22:06.334 --> 22:08.813
<i>But people loved hating
me and Donna together.</i>

22:08.813 --> 22:10.022
<i>Look...</i>

22:10.063 --> 22:11.294
Here's the deal.

22:11.294 --> 22:13.925
We've won "Scavenger Hunt"
two times running.

22:13.925 --> 22:16.905
The audience, they're
desperate for us to lose.

22:16.905 --> 22:18.455
By flirting with Colleen,

22:18.455 --> 22:20.768
I gave them hope that that could happen.

22:20.808 --> 22:23.120
But throwing the game because she was hot,

22:23.120 --> 22:24.639
give me a break, man.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.267
Colleen's hot, yeah,

22:26.267 --> 22:29.335
but is she "wow, I'm gonna give
up another $1 million" hot?

22:29.377 --> 22:30.833
No way! Unh-unh.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.469
When Donna accused you of having an affair,

22:32.469 --> 22:34.595
why didn't you tell us she
thought it was with Colleen?

22:34.595 --> 22:36.279
'Cause I knew you'd jump to conclusions

22:36.279 --> 22:38.084
and try and pin the murder on me.

22:38.084 --> 22:39.704
Sanchez: Actually, Mr. Cochran,

22:39.704 --> 22:41.403
we're hoping that you can tell us

22:41.441 --> 22:44.353
who else might have wanted
to hurt you and your wife.

22:46.119 --> 22:49.748
W-what, because suddenly
I'm not guilty anymore?

22:49.880 --> 22:51.361
That's correct.

22:51.539 --> 22:54.002
Yeah, we no longer
suspect you of the murder.

22:54.024 --> 22:56.441
- We're considering other...
- Oh, come on!

22:56.441 --> 22:58.678
I know the "good cop, bad cop" thing.

22:59.454 --> 23:01.182
Mr. Cochran, neither of us

23:01.182 --> 23:03.364
is accusing you of killing your wife.

23:03.364 --> 23:05.598
Uh-huh, sure. What am I, an idiot?

23:05.647 --> 23:10.145
<i>You are no longer a suspect
in your wife's death!</i>

23:11.085 --> 23:13.047
Do you understand?!

23:17.543 --> 23:18.871
[ Chuckles ] Boom.

23:19.446 --> 23:20.325
Ha!

23:20.357 --> 23:22.199
See, I'm getting to you, man!

23:22.417 --> 23:24.683
Now you're really starting to hate me.

23:24.877 --> 23:27.982
And that's why I'm so
valuable to cable audiences.

23:28.028 --> 23:30.753
- <i>I'm like a Tony Soprano or a Walter White...</i>
- What's going on with Julio?

23:30.753 --> 23:32.949
- <i>A bad guy who acts good.</i>
- I mean, these people are awful, but still.

23:32.949 --> 23:35.483
- I'm not sure. He's been like this since the crime scene.
- <i>And then I can get people to hate me so bad...</i>

23:35.483 --> 23:38.506
Maybe you and I can talk
to him later on, Captain.

23:38.506 --> 23:40.883
<i>You know, that spin-off,
that might live after all.</i>

23:41.347 --> 23:44.127
I probably already know the
answer to this question,

23:44.166 --> 23:46.958
but has anyone ever threatened your life?

23:46.958 --> 23:49.753
Threats are the lifeblood of reality TV.

23:49.753 --> 23:50.734
Go online.

23:50.734 --> 23:53.338
- Read the things they say about moi.
- Tao: Mm-hmm.

23:53.789 --> 23:56.149
Other than right this second,

23:56.993 --> 23:59.121
have you ever been
concerned for your safety?

23:59.400 --> 24:00.730
Well, there is this one guy

24:00.764 --> 24:03.406
who popped up recently in the twitterverse.

24:03.406 --> 24:06.373
Calls himself thextermin8r,

24:06.373 --> 24:08.069
'cause we're the
cockroaches, and he's the...

24:08.069 --> 24:09.340
We get it.

24:09.634 --> 24:12.977
Yeah, well,<i>that</i> guy. Thextermin8r.

24:12.977 --> 24:14.091
Buzz.

24:14.091 --> 24:15.597
I'll check online.

24:15.986 --> 24:19.817
With the instagram, the
Twitter, and the YouTube.

24:19.857 --> 24:21.767
<i>Yeah. His hatred is intense.</i>

24:21.767 --> 24:23.949
<i>It's like, uh, poetry.</i>

24:23.987 --> 24:25.849
<i>But more vicious and hateful.</i>

24:25.849 --> 24:28.664
Let's go back to Mrs.
Dickerhoof for a moment.

24:29.265 --> 24:32.405
I understand Reggie Fluke was
also quite taken with her.

24:32.405 --> 24:35.158
Yeah. That was part of Colleen's strategy...

24:35.158 --> 24:37.366
Playing Reggie and me against each other.

24:37.366 --> 24:40.086
That's why I sabotaged fluke
and his wife last week,

24:40.086 --> 24:42.111
which is what she wanted me to do.

24:43.029 --> 24:45.175
Colleen, man.

24:45.175 --> 24:46.190
<i>She came to play.</i>

24:46.190 --> 24:48.568
So, Colleen used Chip to
get rid of the Flukes.

24:48.568 --> 24:51.441
Maybe this week she figured
out a way to get rid of Chip.

24:51.441 --> 24:53.207
Well, we can only ask her.

24:53.246 --> 24:55.236
None of that was <i>my</i> idea.

24:55.236 --> 24:56.994
Wrapping Chip around my little finger...

24:56.994 --> 24:58.269
That was in the script.

24:58.269 --> 25:01.046
Oh, so, there's actually a script.

25:01.046 --> 25:02.967
Colleen: Of course, silly.

25:03.012 --> 25:04.829
Reality doesn't just happen.

25:05.388 --> 25:07.881
Unless you think I make it up all on my own.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.232
Well, if anyone could, I'm
sure it would be <i>you.</i>

25:13.269 --> 25:15.920
The writer guides us in the situations

25:15.920 --> 25:17.572
to stir up drama.

25:17.980 --> 25:20.671
And whatever the show
suggests, you go along with...

25:20.671 --> 25:21.723
Is that right?

25:21.723 --> 25:23.384
Well, we don't really have a choice.

25:23.384 --> 25:26.419
For a chance to win, you have
to give them what they want.

25:27.169 --> 25:29.919
And then give them what they want some more.

25:30.254 --> 25:31.246
Oh?

25:31.246 --> 25:34.191
Oh, so you were only flirting with Chip

25:34.191 --> 25:36.336
because you were told to.

25:36.604 --> 25:38.699
Of course. You're getting it.

25:38.699 --> 25:41.309
See, honey, he's not just a silver fox.

25:44.063 --> 25:44.701
Um...

25:44.739 --> 25:46.560
Do you agree with that, Les?

25:46.560 --> 25:49.118
That Colleen's flirtations aren't real?

25:49.958 --> 25:51.171
No.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.686
It's all for the cameras.

25:54.184 --> 25:56.259
I did go after Reggie on my own.

25:56.259 --> 25:57.399
I didn't like it.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.522
Eyes on the prize, sweetheart.

25:59.561 --> 26:00.795
It worked, right?

26:00.795 --> 26:02.703
Chip made sure the Flukes went home,

26:02.703 --> 26:05.375
and now we win $1 million
and come back next season,

26:05.375 --> 26:07.364
so, you're welcome, Les.

26:07.364 --> 26:10.416
So, how did Chip get the
Flukes out of the way?

26:10.791 --> 26:12.253
In last week's challenge,

26:12.253 --> 26:14.763
couples had to start a fire
before getting their clue.

26:14.801 --> 26:16.582
Reggie couldn't get a spark going.

26:16.582 --> 26:19.669
<i>Because</i> Chip urinated on their wood.

26:19.669 --> 26:23.486
Of course, I didn't suggest anything so...

26:23.486 --> 26:25.049
So vulgar.

26:25.087 --> 26:26.375
And we wouldn't even have known

26:26.428 --> 26:27.956
if Chip hadn't bragged about it.

26:28.366 --> 26:31.062
"I'm responsible for us all
being in the finale, bro."

26:31.968 --> 26:34.055

36:14.247 --> 36:15.803
What are you saying?

36:16.690 --> 36:18.509
Turn off the camera, hoodie!

36:19.198 --> 36:21.078
Buzz, will you take over, please?

36:21.078 --> 36:23.325
Mr. Olin, I'd like you to listen to this

36:23.325 --> 36:25.146
and see if it sounds familiar.

36:25.689 --> 36:28.991
You paid Dr. Fluke cash to create a program

36:28.991 --> 36:30.735
to let you hack into the Cochrans' car

36:30.735 --> 36:33.713
and drive it off a cliff
with them inside of it!

36:33.713 --> 36:36.079
No. Hey, it wasn't me.

36:36.502 --> 36:39.108
Colleen and Les were
much nearer the Cochrans!

36:39.108 --> 36:41.063
Hey, we played fair and square.

36:41.063 --> 36:42.709
It's a nice try, Nate.

36:42.709 --> 36:45.897
But the program runs on a cellphone,

36:45.897 --> 36:48.504
and the Dickerhoofs were not allowed

36:48.504 --> 36:50.381
to have one during the race.

36:50.601 --> 36:52.143
Sharon: But you did have one,

36:52.143 --> 36:55.709
and we have a warrant
allowing us to examine it.

36:56.970 --> 37:00.112
I don't understand, Nate.
You said the Cochrans were gold.

37:00.112 --> 37:02.035
Why would you want them off your show?

37:02.075 --> 37:03.064
[ Scoffs lightly ]

37:03.776 --> 37:05.215
<i>My</i> show.

37:05.573 --> 37:07.347
Are you kidding me?

37:07.672 --> 37:09.869
Yeah, I conceived it. I produced it.

37:09.869 --> 37:12.802
And then those Cockroaches
took what I designed

37:12.802 --> 37:14.504
to be a metaphor for marriage

37:14.504 --> 37:17.741
and turned it into "the
Texas chainsaw massacre."

37:17.741 --> 37:19.881
Plus, you know how much I'm getting paid?

37:20.043 --> 37:21.577
$25,000 an episode.

37:21.577 --> 37:23.135
Chip's already made $2 million,

37:23.135 --> 37:24.941
and he was close to getting $3 million.

37:24.941 --> 37:28.234
Well, if you were so unhappy,
why didn't you just quit?

37:28.234 --> 37:29.725
Don't you think I tried?

37:30.066 --> 37:31.923
I have a six-year contract.

37:32.296 --> 37:33.876
I sold a pilot, too.

37:35.697 --> 37:37.078
Great script.

37:37.742 --> 37:40.407
About an autistic child who solves murders.

37:40.624 --> 37:42.738
And the network wouldn't
let me out to do it.

37:43.098 --> 37:45.375
Hey, I went to Yale!

37:45.375 --> 37:48.052
Yeah, I went to U.S.C. Film School!

37:48.439 --> 37:49.641
For this?!

37:49.641 --> 37:51.708
And the way these people talk to me?

37:51.708 --> 37:54.648
"Hey, Shakespeare, why we
eating goat testicles today?"

37:54.648 --> 37:57.253
Because you're a bunch of attention-seeking,

37:57.253 --> 37:58.974
money-grubbing pigs, that's why.

37:58.974 --> 38:00.702
That's a terrible thing to say!

38:00.702 --> 38:02.924
Those... those were goat testicles?

38:03.227 --> 38:04.958
He told me they were tater tots.

38:06.820 --> 38:08.998
Provenza: Congratulations, Mr. Olin.

38:09.141 --> 38:12.288
You are <i>out</i> of your network contract.

38:12.288 --> 38:14.946
Sharon: But you'll probably be
signing a deal with the state

38:14.946 --> 38:17.643
negotiated by your lawyer
instead of your agent.

38:19.403 --> 38:21.320
You know the real irony here?

38:21.469 --> 38:23.162
My killing Donna Cochran is gonna end up

38:23.162 --> 38:26.008
making the show more popular then ever.

38:26.008 --> 38:28.856
Could you say that one
more time, sir, for camera?

38:32.086 --> 38:34.275
Not only did I kill Donna Cochran,

38:34.275 --> 38:38.101
I'm just sorry I didn't get
her horrible husband, too.

38:38.892 --> 38:40.292
There, how's that?

38:40.625 --> 38:44.120
Cut. Print. Moving on.

38:49.767 --> 38:54.233
So, Nate Olin was offered
second-degree murder,

38:54.263 --> 38:57.633
but he's convinced that once
they've had a chance to review

38:57.633 --> 39:01.204
all the episodes of
"American Scavenger Hunt,"

39:01.204 --> 39:03.199
the jury will understand.

39:03.199 --> 39:04.622
[ <i>Laughs</i> ] <i>Too bad.</i>

39:04.622 --> 39:07.403
<i>Because I really hated that
scheming Dickerhoof lady.</i>

39:07.403 --> 39:09.686
- <i>Hey, mom.</i>
- Hi, Rusty.

39:09.686 --> 39:11.369
<i>How was your interview with Slider?</i>

39:11.369 --> 39:12.317
Interesting.

39:12.892 --> 39:16.340
Knowing he was being filmed
changed his attitude a little.

39:16.340 --> 39:19.404
Oh, Sharon, did you figure out
how to explain things to Julio?

39:20.130 --> 39:21.901
Well, not exactly,

39:21.935 --> 39:24.993
but I think I've offered him a way

39:24.993 --> 39:27.216
to explain things to himself.

39:27.687 --> 39:30.718
And Lieutenant Provenza's gonna
check in on him afterwards

39:30.758 --> 39:33.251
and see how it went.

39:35.258 --> 39:38.497
As the car began to roll over,

39:38.497 --> 39:40.182
the airbags deployed.

39:40.182 --> 39:42.264
While they softened the initial impact,

39:42.264 --> 39:45.100
they can't stabilize the neck.

39:45.138 --> 39:47.849
It broke on the first turn of the car.

39:51.513 --> 39:53.582
But in a way, that's...

39:55.088 --> 39:56.618
That's good news.

39:56.947 --> 39:59.094
Because even though her skull fractured

39:59.094 --> 40:01.508
when her head crashed into the window...

40:03.806 --> 40:05.672
She never felt it.

40:08.427 --> 40:09.503
[ Sighs ]

40:09.503 --> 40:13.889
A-anyway, it's, um, it's all in this report.

40:14.723 --> 40:16.904
Let us know if you have any questions.

40:21.663 --> 40:23.302
Close call, huh?

40:24.010 --> 40:25.812
Am I lucky or what?

40:26.218 --> 40:28.503
If you had been lucky, sir...

40:30.386 --> 40:35.164
Your wife would have gotten
out of the car instead of you,

40:35.164 --> 40:39.006
and you wouldn't have the rest
of your life to wonder what...

40:40.910 --> 40:43.310
You could have done to save her.

40:45.115 --> 40:48.393
The L.A.P.D. sympathizes
with your loss, sir.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.034
Excuse me.

41:01.313 --> 41:02.558
Julio.

41:03.606 --> 41:04.714
Yes, Lieutenant.

41:04.714 --> 41:08.364
Any chance that you could, uh,
help us wrap up our paperwork

41:08.364 --> 41:10.732
so we could get out of here before midnight?

41:10.732 --> 41:13.079
Sorry, sir, I was a little distracted.

41:13.117 --> 41:15.705
Hmm. Feeling better?

41:15.958 --> 41:18.081
I know what's bothering me.

41:19.530 --> 41:21.301
I guess that's better.

41:22.445 --> 41:25.574
Yeah. It is.

41:27.132 --> 41:28.591
It is.

41:33.367 --> 41:35.135
I hope it is.
