This dance party
is private,

19:07.316 --> 19:10.166
and he isn't even
on the guest list.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.016
Yeah.

19:28.116 --> 19:30.016
Those were my friends.

19:30.050 --> 19:31.350
I thought we were friends.

19:31.383 --> 19:34.150
Friends don't do
what you did.

19:34.183 --> 19:36.033
Are you kids playing nice?

19:36.066 --> 19:40.233
[Gasps] What a filthy
child I've raised.

19:40.266 --> 19:44.083
Now you clean your room
and do your homework!

19:46.233 --> 19:48.150
Mom, your roast is on fire.

19:48.183 --> 19:50.133
The roast?

19:52.233 --> 19:56.166
I can't believe you
tried to zap my mom!

19:56.200 --> 20:00.183
Oh, ow, oh, oh.

20:00.216 --> 20:02.300
Ooh, you...

20:02.333 --> 20:08.333
Dexter, Dexter. Stupid
robot zapped my friends
and tried to zap mom.

20:11.366 --> 20:15.350
What's this? A cry for help?

20:15.383 --> 20:16.483
Stop it, Dexter.

20:17.016 --> 20:22.166
Could it be that my dear sister
finally gets what she deserves?

20:22.200 --> 20:26.400
Stop it. Stop being so mean.

20:29.016 --> 20:32.450
Ha, ha, ha...

20:32.483 --> 20:36.133
Wahh, wahh...

20:49.300 --> 20:54.133
Dee Dee, make it stop.
Please, please!

21:04.250 --> 21:09.250
Ooh. Dee Dee. How did you
stop that crazy robot?

21:09.283 --> 21:11.200
Beats me.

21:11.233 --> 21:16.066
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm at your every command.

21:21.383 --> 21:26.050
Thanks, but no thanks, Dexter.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.283
I can dress myself.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.133
Enter at your own peril,

21:38.166 --> 21:42.066
past the vaulted door where
impossible things may happen
