I have always thought

20:22.678 --> 20:23.978
it was weird
that a mountain floats

20:23.980 --> 20:25.547
when there's obviously

20:25.549 --> 20:27.382
some invisible force
pulling us downward

20:27.384 --> 20:28.582
and keeping everything
around us

20:28.584 --> 20:31.118
from drifting off
into the sky.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.787
Of course, this is just
a theory. (CHUCKLES)

But that's why
we haven't found one up here.

down there!

20:56.612 --> 20:57.846

20:57.848 --> 20:59.580
Because it's in the stones.

So is the one that says
there's no smallfoot.

21:01.685 --> 21:02.850
And yet, you saw one.

21:02.852 --> 21:04.118
Yeah. Why is there a stone

21:04.120 --> 21:05.787
that says something
doesn't exist?

21:05.789 --> 21:07.555

that it actually does?

it wasn't a smallfoot,
