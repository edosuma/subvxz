A super deluxe underground mansion.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.016
This mystery is getting weirder
by the minute.

16:15.183 --> 16:19.229
What's a fancy place like this
doing underground on a deserted island?

16:19.396 --> 16:21.606
Let's take a look around.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.110
Somebody's actually been living
down here.

16:25.277 --> 16:28.572
A lot of somebodies judging
by the size of the place.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.032
FRED:
Hey, look. This is today's newspaper.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.493
Whoever was here left in a big hurry.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.078
What's in here?

16:35.245 --> 16:39.749
Jeepers, a kitchen big enough
for a restaurant.

16:43.295 --> 16:47.174
Do you believe that?
It's crammed with fresh food.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.010
Now we know why we found
all that food on the dock.

16:50.177 --> 16:54.264
But who was eating it? And why would
they come here of all places?

16:54.431 --> 16:56.308
[GHOSTLY MOANING NEARBY]

16:56.474 --> 16:58.393
Listen.

16:59.936 --> 17:03.857
Sounds like it's coming
from that ventilator. Come on.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.365
[MOANING CONTINUES]

17:13.325 --> 17:16.703

down here.

Look.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.042
FRED:
It's Captain Morgan.

17:23.210 --> 17:27.756
-We've got to get him out of there.
-Let's see if we can find a rope.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.467
Well, Scoob, it looks like
we lost old tin puss.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.641
Look, Scoob, like,
here's our way out of this mess.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.312
-Ready?
-Yeah.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.157
-Like, let's make tracks, Scoob.
-Yeah.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.328
A few more steps
and, like, we're home free.

Scoob.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.056
Yeah.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.768

he has to put numbers on them.

Are you okay, Captain Morgan?

I've been down here for hours.

to look around the island...

18:41.162 --> 18:44.833
...and somebody grabbed me
from behind and that's all | remember.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.169
Obviously, somebody didn't want you
snooping around.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.840
Well, now that we know you're okay,
we better find Shaggy and Scooby...

18:52.007 --> 18:55.302
...capture the ghost
and wrap up this mystery.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.060
-Sharks.
-Like, hold it, Scoob, old pal...

really is.

SHAGGY:
Mama Mione.

20:35.568 --> 20:40.198
Her café on the mainland
was just a cover for her real business:

20:41.074 --> 20:45.078
smuggling convicts in and out
of her fancy hideaway under the prison.

20:45.245 --> 20:48.873
The convicts were hidden inside
the shark-painted torpedoes.

Then they were launched.

...look advantage of the old Iron Face
legend to scare off any curious boaters.

until you showed up...

...with your plan to take tourists
out to Skull Island.

Her high-paying guests panicked...

21:10.270 --> 21:12.647
...and demanded to be taken back
to the mainland.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.816
That's why we found
the place empty.

21:14.983 --> 21:18.653
Those chickens, they didn't even stay
to finish all that terrific food.
