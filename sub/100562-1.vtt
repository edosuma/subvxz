WEBVTT

03:23.312 --> 03:24.378
Ah, oo.

03:25.748 --> 03:26.813
I'm into it.

03:27.983 --> 03:30.450
It's creepin' me out but I like
it.

03:32.388 --> 03:33.453
Did it just move?

03:34.890 --> 03:38.025
I mean, it does
look pretty life-like, huh.

03:38.027 --> 03:40.861
We should go
take a picture with it.

03:40.863 --> 03:42.496
Yes, let's do it!

03:42.498 --> 03:43.664
Okay, zombie.

03:46.769 --> 03:47.834
Hey!

03:49.371 --> 03:50.604
- Ah.
- Hey, hey, hey.

03:50.606 --> 03:51.505
- Don't touch.
- That's really cute.

03:51.507 --> 03:52.689
Whatever, he's super cute.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.874
Look, it's made
by the best sculptor

03:53.876 --> 03:55.609
in the city, don't touch.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.577
We're not touching, and excuse
us.

03:57.579 --> 03:58.779
You don't have to talk to us
like that.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.980
I can't talk to you however I
want.

03:59.982 --> 04:01.048
I'm the manager.

04:01.050 --> 04:03.483
You are not the manager.

04:03.485 --> 04:04.851
Wait, your name is Was?

04:04.853 --> 04:07.054
My name is Sam.

04:07.056 --> 04:08.989
Your
name tag's upside down.

04:12.027 --> 04:13.409
Look at that gun.

04:13.411 --> 04:14.794
Look, if you're not gonna it,

04:14.797 --> 04:16.463
you don't wanna buy it, don't
touch.

04:16.465 --> 04:17.998
It's very expensive, full-scale
figure

04:18.000 --> 04:19.800
of Borge from "Jurassic
Thunder."

04:21.003 --> 04:22.803
So, do you want to buy it?

04:22.805 --> 04:24.120
Ellen, no.

04:24.122 --> 04:25.438
Oh, no, I don't want to buy
it.

04:25.441 --> 04:26.973
It's stupid.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.542
Oh, my God.

04:28.544 --> 04:30.010
We're just
here to use the bathroom.

04:30.012 --> 04:31.078
No!

04:31.080 --> 04:32.879
No, just like that, just,
"No!"

04:32.881 --> 04:34.881
Restrooms are for customers.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.950
Oh, yep, I am so done with
you.

04:36.952 --> 04:38.485
Let's go find a real manager.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.853
- Let's go, Sarah.
- Yeah.

04:39.855 --> 04:41.555
I am the manager!

04:41.557 --> 04:43.423
And I'm Princess Leia.

04:43.425 --> 04:44.658
Yeah.

04:48.764 --> 04:49.830
Hello!

04:50.833 --> 04:52.499
Hello!

04:52.501 --> 04:53.633
Someone could be robbing this
place

04:53.635 --> 04:55.502
and no one would even know.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.405
- You mean like that guy?
- Hello, hello!

04:58.407 --> 05:00.474
God, I feel like I'm
in the "Twilight Zone."

05:00.476 --> 05:03.710
Can I please go to the ladies
room?

05:03.712 --> 05:05.412
Hello!

05:06.682 --> 05:08.648
Oh yeah, sorry, it's right
back there.

05:08.650 --> 05:10.984
I told them it's for customers
only!

05:10.986 --> 05:13.120
Oh, whatever, Was.

05:13.122 --> 05:14.721
Yeah, what's that
about, anyway?

05:14.723 --> 05:18.058
Sam was manager for one day.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.459
Here you
go,

05:19.461 --> 05:21.395
buy yourself a personality.

05:21.397 --> 05:23.163
Hey, what is that?

05:23.165 --> 05:25.281
That?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.400
Oh that, that needs to
be seen to be understood.

05:31.473 --> 05:32.906
Oh man, nice cover!

05:32.908 --> 05:34.257
Yeah.

05:34.259 --> 05:35.609
Due to their delicate nature,

05:35.611 --> 05:38.779
comic books need to be
kept in pristine condition.

05:38.781 --> 05:40.781
So one day someone might buy it

05:40.783 --> 05:43.016
and it hasn't lost any of its
value.

05:43.018 --> 05:44.885
Ah, no, in your dreams.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.753
I'm not, this is "Jurassic
Thunder."

05:46.755 --> 05:49.489
It's like the Holy Grail
of all comic books.

05:49.491 --> 05:51.625
It's got weaponized dinos,
warlords,

05:51.627 --> 05:55.629
zombies, commandos, nukes,
it's got like everything.

05:55.631 --> 05:56.797
Isn't that a book?

05:56.799 --> 05:58.431
No, no, that's "Jurassic
Dead."

05:58.433 --> 06:00.066
You're thinking of something
completely different.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.534
Oh.

06:01.536 --> 06:03.003
No, but that's a
movie, right?

06:03.005 --> 06:04.438
I've never heard of it.

06:06.775 --> 06:08.175
Will you wipe that drool off
your face.

06:08.177 --> 06:09.910
I'm not your anime girlfriend.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.545
Has that ever worked for you?

06:11.547 --> 06:12.879
It did once.

06:14.516 --> 06:15.549
Let's do this.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.551
No, you can't do that.

06:17.553 --> 06:19.820
That's Jim Man Tim, bro.

06:19.822 --> 06:20.887
Oh yeah?

06:24.193 --> 06:26.993
Page one, it's in the desert,

06:26.995 --> 06:29.796
I bet this is where the dinos
are kept.

06:50.052 --> 06:51.218
Colonel Sanders, sir.

06:51.220 --> 06:52.752
What is it?

06:52.754 --> 06:54.153
The general would like
to see you in the war room.

06:54.155 --> 06:55.555
Airman, does it look
like I have time to speak?

06:55.557 --> 06:57.224
Details, man, details.

06:57.226 --> 06:59.125
The Russians, sir.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.027
They'll be here in approximately
one hour.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.796
Great, just what I
need.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.531
Bears growling at my doorstep.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.812
Access denied.

07:18.814 --> 07:19.880
Goddam.

07:20.949 --> 07:22.549
Access denied.

07:23.218 --> 07:24.518
Here, allow me, Colonel.

07:25.954 --> 07:27.331
Access granted.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.710
You make a note to
get

07:28.712 --> 07:30.090
that fuckin' thing fixed,
understand me?

07:30.092 --> 07:32.726
Absolutely, copy
that, sir.

07:32.728 --> 07:34.911
General.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.097
Ah, I thought you may
miss the unfolding action.

07:37.099 --> 07:38.999
We're now at DEFCON 3, Colonel.

07:39.801 --> 07:41.868
I can't believe it's
spread this far, this fast.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.604
Mm, and it's still growing.

07:45.607 --> 07:47.623
Any contact from their leader?

07:47.625 --> 07:49.642
No, it's possible to
think he might be dead.

07:50.279 --> 07:52.779
Nah, he's in hiding.

07:52.781 --> 07:54.180
If he's smart.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.950
A rampant virus of this
magnitude?

07:57.753 --> 07:59.185
Makes that hard to believe.

08:00.055 --> 08:02.055
Well, then we strike
by air.

08:02.057 --> 08:03.924
Are you willing to take that
chance?

08:03.926 --> 08:07.027
Even knowing the surrounding
countries may retaliate?

08:07.029 --> 08:08.895
This is a war of complexities.

08:08.897 --> 08:13.700
No scenario, none, offers a
good solution at this time.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.251
You think for one second

08:15.253 --> 08:16.803
those surrounding
countries wouldn't thank us

08:16.805 --> 08:18.905
for getting rid of those
cannibals?

08:18.907 --> 08:20.306
Fry it.

08:20.308 --> 08:21.708
And if this infected country
is capable

08:21.710 --> 08:23.677
of using their nukes in
retaliation?

08:23.679 --> 08:26.813
You want to take credit for
starting World War III, Colonel?

08:26.815 --> 08:28.582
It's better than letting
the Russians dictate

08:28.584 --> 08:30.784
what we use as weapons, General.

08:30.786 --> 08:31.985
There's no decision as of yet.

08:31.987 --> 08:33.803
Let's see it tomorrow.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.622
We'll make a calculated
decision at that time.

08:35.624 --> 08:38.325
You can't be seriously
considering their option, General.

08:38.327 --> 08:39.926
They walked in here

08:39.928 --> 08:42.062
as if they'd already
sealed the deal with us.

08:42.064 --> 08:44.898
I will have to address the
president in less than an hour.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.200
I suggest you stay focused

08:47.202 --> 08:50.103
and open to accepting some
options.

08:50.105 --> 08:51.171
General?

08:51.173 --> 08:54.074
You want to continue
this discussion, Colonel?

08:54.076 --> 08:56.309
Let's move this to private
quarters.

08:56.311 --> 08:57.243
Attention on the
base,

08:57.245 --> 08:58.211
attention on the base.

08:58.213 --> 08:59.346
The Russians are coming.

08:59.348 --> 09:00.814
Looks like we have
guests.

09:00.816 --> 09:02.349
I repeat,
the Russians are coming,

09:02.351 --> 09:04.084
command post out.

10:41.116 --> 10:43.950
We don't remove
hats on foreign soil.

10:43.952 --> 10:47.721
Given the situation, I
don't really care about hats.

10:47.723 --> 10:49.222
My operations officer.

10:49.224 --> 10:50.757
Colonel Sanders.

10:50.759 --> 10:53.326
Sanders, like the
chicken.

10:53.328 --> 10:54.843
It's good chicken.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.430
Seriously?

10:59.234 --> 11:01.201
I think we've broken the ice
here.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.869
Let's talk about your weapons.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.708
Get
down on the ground now!

11:25.710 --> 11:27.127
Face down, hands
where we can see them!

11:27.129 --> 11:29.963
Whoa, easy there, tiger.

11:29.965 --> 11:30.963
You call it in!

11:30.965 --> 11:31.964
You call it
in!

11:31.967 --> 11:32.932
No, you call it in!

11:32.934 --> 11:33.899
No, you,
I called it in last time!

11:33.901 --> 11:34.866
Rock, paper scissors.

11:34.868 --> 11:35.833
Rock, paper,
scissors.

11:35.835 --> 11:36.801
- Ready.
- Time.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.721
Dammit!

11:39.723 --> 11:41.039
You call it
in.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.076
Don't look at me.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.346
HQ, this is
Scrat, have copy, over.

11:46.348 --> 11:48.815
Scrat, command post
has you loud and clear.

11:48.817 --> 11:51.317
Roger, one
infiltrator, south perimeter,

11:52.254 --> 11:56.890
wearing camouflage,
has a pair of bullnose,

11:56.892 --> 12:00.927
a camera and some squazzlers or
something.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.128
Secure and detain
suspect.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.531
Roger, Scrat out.

12:05.367 --> 12:06.298
Make this copy on.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.232
What are we
doin'?

12:07.235 --> 12:08.935
Zip tie him.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.103
- Hands behind your back.
- Oh, what?

12:10.105 --> 12:11.871
Hands behind your
back!

12:13.090 --> 12:14.306
Speak when only spoken too.

12:15.544 --> 12:17.410
You guys are real friendly
around here.

12:17.412 --> 12:19.045
Police are safe work.

12:21.016 --> 12:22.198
Think this is a joke?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.383
I'm startin'
to think

12:23.385 --> 12:24.951
we might be your first date,
buddy.

12:26.288 --> 12:29.155
Oh, you got the ovens on,
whoa, whoa!

12:30.492 --> 12:32.158
Can't we all just play nice?

12:34.596 --> 12:36.462
Oh yeah, you like that?

12:36.464 --> 12:37.964
From a squaw.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.014
Helps to keep...

12:39.016 --> 12:40.065
What's
your name, Goldilocks?

12:40.068 --> 12:41.267
Billy Wayne.

12:42.571 --> 12:45.205
What's your job
description?

12:45.207 --> 12:48.141
Well, I'm a journalist.

12:50.946 --> 12:54.314
Yeah, oh, that's what the
camera's for, binoculars.

12:56.084 --> 12:57.016
- Hm.
- Let's go.

12:57.018 --> 12:59.219
Whoa, oh my God.

13:04.226 --> 13:06.125
The problem in this tiny area

13:06.127 --> 13:10.096
in South Africa is a bigger
issue than one would think.

13:10.932 --> 13:12.232
That a strategic hit

13:12.234 --> 13:16.236
with nukes would resolve
the problem immediately.

13:16.238 --> 13:18.171
And I second that notion,
General.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.473
But, but we can't.

13:20.475 --> 13:22.342
We have a solution,
General.

13:22.344 --> 13:25.211
I know, I'm just tryin' to
justify it.

13:25.213 --> 13:28.081
We have three
weapon sites active.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.582
They've been that
way for three days now.

13:29.584 --> 13:32.585
South African government
dismantled their missiles

13:32.587 --> 13:37.657
shortly after signing Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Act in 1991.

13:37.659 --> 13:40.009
That's correct, too.

13:40.011 --> 13:42.362
But now they're intact
and ready to launch.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.130
Good at your history, um?

13:44.132 --> 13:47.967
Colonel General Weapons
Specialist, Lieutenant Warnick.

13:47.969 --> 13:50.136
We can't use nuclear force.

13:50.138 --> 13:51.638
Conventional strikes are out as
well,

13:51.640 --> 13:54.240
due to the frailty of the
world's imminent war threat.

13:54.242 --> 13:57.110
Any visible action could
send us into World War III.

13:57.112 --> 13:59.061
Any communication from there
either?

13:59.063 --> 14:01.013
No, no, I have a meeting
with the president shortly

14:01.016 --> 14:02.382
to discuss that situation.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.200
Colonel?

14:04.202 --> 14:06.019
All right, We've attempted
communications continuously.

14:06.021 --> 14:08.554
But I've got reason to
believe that he's dead.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.657
And there's a rebel force that
has taken complete control

14:10.659 --> 14:12.992
of the military's
infrastructure.

14:12.994 --> 14:14.093
But all that being said,

14:14.095 --> 14:16.029
the country has another problem,
sir.

14:16.031 --> 14:19.265
There's a virus infecting all
the humans in this region.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.634
It's turning them into something

14:21.636 --> 14:23.970
that's well beyond imagination.

14:23.972 --> 14:25.138
Zombies.

14:25.140 --> 14:28.441
Zombie.

14:46.227 --> 14:49.095
We have a weapon that
will work well for you.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.532
The biologics are sturdy
and very effective.

14:52.534 --> 14:56.302
Like a surgical intervention
in any war situation.

14:56.304 --> 14:58.037
Exactly what are we dealing
with here?

14:58.039 --> 15:00.622
I can assure you, General,

15:00.624 --> 15:03.208
these weapons were designed
exactly for this situation.

15:04.446 --> 15:07.246
An ant problem in the
garden is quickly dealt with

15:07.248 --> 15:12.185
by introducing frogs to
eat away the problem.

15:12.187 --> 15:14.187
Wait, wait, well, you're
telling me

15:14.189 --> 15:17.123
that you brought giant frogs
to help combat terrorism?

15:18.727 --> 15:19.759
They're quite enormous.

15:19.761 --> 15:22.161
Is a symbology, Colonel.

15:22.163 --> 15:26.132
Are you saying that we have a
biologic

15:26.134 --> 15:30.603
that can eat our way out of this
problem?

15:30.605 --> 15:32.572
I believe we do, General.

15:32.574 --> 15:34.640
This, I
gotta see.

16:10.545 --> 16:13.813
You know you have inflamed
a greater uprising, Alfred.

16:13.815 --> 16:16.215
You could start a global war.

16:16.217 --> 16:18.351
No, we could change world.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.286
Listen to yourself, Alfred.

16:20.288 --> 16:22.155
You act as a dictator.

16:22.157 --> 16:26.292
No, General Shultz,
I am in authority now.

16:26.294 --> 16:27.794
And what of all the
others that supported you?

16:27.796 --> 16:29.829
You will let them die as well?

16:34.836 --> 16:36.702
You can't fix everything,
Alfred.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.337
This virus is real.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.176
The only reason I spare your
life

16:43.178 --> 16:45.311
because you were my friend in
school.

16:45.313 --> 16:48.681
And you enlisted yourself
under the Western hypocrisy.

16:48.683 --> 16:51.417
The next time you warn me again,

16:51.419 --> 16:53.119
I will feed you to them myself.

16:55.857 --> 16:58.691
Let's go to the bush, get you
a woman.

16:58.693 --> 16:59.826
You need to relax.

17:52.347 --> 17:53.813
You can lower your weapons,

17:53.815 --> 17:55.681
they won't be very effective.

18:06.728 --> 18:10.630
We've equipped the biologic
with 50-caliber long range gun.

18:10.632 --> 18:15.434
Operator controlled for
guaranteed target execution.

18:17.338 --> 18:19.605
Manipulation over its movement
is achieved

18:19.607 --> 18:21.474
through energy manipulation.

18:22.343 --> 18:25.211
Like steering a horse with the
reins.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.112
Unbelievable.

18:27.114 --> 18:28.347
Yeah, but how good is its aim?

18:40.361 --> 18:42.195
Acceptable.

18:44.732 --> 18:48.234
I just wish you would have
picked a cheaper target.

18:48.236 --> 18:51.871
We have six ready, weaponized,
ready for its deployment.

18:54.409 --> 18:56.776
Sir, we have
the president if you'd.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.584
Room, attention!

19:06.821 --> 19:07.887
As you were.

19:12.293 --> 19:13.793
Sir, you can't smoke in here.

19:16.431 --> 19:18.631
Can you adjust the color
on that thing, please.

19:18.633 --> 19:19.865
It's already adjusted, sir.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.601
Am I on it?

19:21.603 --> 19:22.735
That's the actual color, sir.

19:22.737 --> 19:23.803
Okay.

19:24.973 --> 19:27.506
Hello, hello?

19:30.445 --> 19:31.310
Hello, Mr. President.

19:31.312 --> 19:32.745
Any updates, General?

19:32.747 --> 19:35.248
We're now DEFCON 1, Mr.
President.

19:36.317 --> 19:38.718
We may have a current military
option

19:38.720 --> 19:41.854
for a strategic attack
on the rogue country.

19:41.856 --> 19:44.323
Very good, General.

19:44.325 --> 19:46.726
I assume you've already
met with the Russians?

19:47.862 --> 19:50.363
Uri, Boris, hello.

19:51.866 --> 19:52.932
Natasha.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.535
Do you know them, Mr.
President?

19:58.306 --> 19:59.605
Who?

19:59.607 --> 20:01.340
The Russians.

20:01.342 --> 20:02.408
Where?

20:07.315 --> 20:08.014
I don't know what you're
talking about.

20:08.016 --> 20:09.715
Right here, sir.

20:09.717 --> 20:11.384
What's your point, Colonel?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.320
Sir, these Russians, around
the table.

20:14.322 --> 20:15.488
The ones you just said hello to.

20:15.490 --> 20:16.956
Do you know then?

20:17.992 --> 20:21.761
Anyways, I want you to treat
them as well as our guests.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.063
I appreciate all your hard work

20:25.033 --> 20:28.034
and we're going to get
through this together.

20:28.036 --> 20:29.368
There's a little blip.

20:29.370 --> 20:30.336
I'm thinking we need to go

20:30.338 --> 20:32.838
with the Russian's plan on this.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.776
I've seen their weapons, yeah,
they're very, very effective.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.378
You've got to be
kidding me.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.446
Come again?

20:41.382 --> 20:42.648
You said something.

20:42.650 --> 20:44.015
Sir.

20:44.017 --> 20:45.383
I couldn't hear you,
your lips were moving.

20:46.054 --> 20:49.522
I just said, "We'll be
killing," sir.

20:50.858 --> 20:54.760
Terrific, good luck, man.

20:54.762 --> 20:55.828
Keep me posted.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.966
You've heard the president.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.036
Let's prep, load, send 'em out.

21:06.074 --> 21:09.408
All right.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.884
Sir, we have a
situation in the waiting room.

21:18.886 --> 21:19.985
Now?

21:19.987 --> 21:21.754
Yes.

21:21.756 --> 21:22.822
Sit.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.141
There's been a
perimeter breach.

21:26.143 --> 21:27.459
The guards have detained the
individual...

21:27.462 --> 21:28.527
Gum.

21:31.532 --> 21:33.632
There has
been a perimeter breach.

21:33.634 --> 21:35.034
The guards have detained the
individual

21:35.036 --> 21:37.103
and they're waiting for
you to question him.

21:37.105 --> 21:38.371
Fine.

21:45.446 --> 21:46.846
I'm Colonel Sanders

21:46.848 --> 21:49.048
and I'm in charge of
this military facility.

21:50.785 --> 21:52.017
You picked a great time breaking

21:52.019 --> 21:54.620
into a secure facility,
stranger.

21:54.622 --> 21:55.688
Why are you here?

21:56.891 --> 21:58.524
Look, I'm just a journalist

21:59.460 --> 22:03.963
here observing a preservation
movement.

22:04.999 --> 22:07.133
Are you sure about that?

22:07.135 --> 22:08.801
What have you seen here today?

22:10.772 --> 22:11.637
Nothin', not yet...

22:11.639 --> 22:13.539
Then cut the bullshit!

22:13.541 --> 22:14.740
You're here takin' pictures

22:14.742 --> 22:16.809
for somebody for intel for
somethin'.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.545
And I'm gonna find out what.

22:20.148 --> 22:21.614
You better pray to God
that when this war's over,

22:21.616 --> 22:23.015
we're all dead.

22:23.017 --> 22:24.417
'Cause if you're alive,

22:25.486 --> 22:28.020
you're ass is gonna be in a
world of hurt.

22:28.022 --> 22:29.422
Keep an eye on him.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.758
You're wanted on the platform,
Colonel.

22:34.028 --> 22:36.762
All right, make sure our
guest understands the terms

22:36.764 --> 22:38.197
of his confinement.

22:38.199 --> 22:41.000
That everything he's done
here is considered terrorism.

22:41.002 --> 22:44.203
So there's not gonna be any
steak dinner for you tonight.

22:44.205 --> 22:45.137
I'm gonna talk with the
president

22:45.139 --> 22:46.739
and straighten some shit out.

23:13.134 --> 23:15.801
Talon five, six, you
are clear for take off.

23:15.803 --> 23:17.803
Winds 350 at 12.

23:17.805 --> 23:19.705
Talon five, six, copy,
cleared for takeoff.

23:25.179 --> 23:26.212
They're in the air, sir.

23:26.214 --> 23:27.880
Good.

23:27.882 --> 23:28.948
Now we wait.

23:38.493 --> 23:42.761
Excuse me, excuse me, what
is that thing doing in here?

23:42.763 --> 23:44.730
This was the test unit.

23:44.732 --> 23:46.265
Unit number seven.

23:46.267 --> 23:49.768
We felt it was not ready
for its deployment.

23:49.770 --> 23:51.202
We need number seven.

23:51.204 --> 23:52.637
Excuse me, you can't just put
things

23:52.640 --> 23:55.274
wherever you want to on this
base.

23:55.276 --> 23:57.676
Not without prior written
approval.

23:57.678 --> 24:00.546
This is very expensive weapon,
Colonel.

24:00.548 --> 24:03.282
I'm sure your higher
command would be very upset

24:03.284 --> 24:05.684
if it was neglected, no?

24:07.255 --> 24:09.688
You better watch that thing
close

24:09.690 --> 24:11.689
and I mean close.

24:11.691 --> 24:13.691
The last thing we need is a
big lizard running around here,

24:13.694 --> 24:17.730
thinking it's in charge
when I'm in charge, got it?

24:18.900 --> 24:20.566
- Da.
- Da, da, da.

24:22.770 --> 24:26.939
Colonel, I'm going to send
a document to upper command

24:26.941 --> 24:29.041
of this conversation.

24:29.043 --> 24:32.912
And it's going to state that
the dinosaur has in fact

24:32.914 --> 24:36.715
no authoritative power
in this facility, okay.

24:36.717 --> 24:37.783
Oh, boy.

24:45.726 --> 24:46.725
Talon five, six
flight,

24:46.727 --> 24:48.193
five miles from the drop zone.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.298
Payloads are over their
respective drop points, General.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.033
All systems green.

24:54.035 --> 24:56.035
Just
waiting for your order, sir.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.237
Deploy.

24:58.239 --> 25:00.105
Drop zone in two
minutes.

25:05.479 --> 25:08.714
Okay, boys, drop your
drawers and dump your loads.

25:09.183 --> 25:10.249
Now we wait.

25:35.209 --> 25:37.610
10
seconds to first impact.

25:39.213 --> 25:42.114
You've used these
biologics before, right?

25:42.116 --> 25:45.684
No, first time.

25:45.686 --> 25:47.653
10 seconds to first impact.

25:48.322 --> 25:52.758
Impact in four, three, two, one.

25:55.363 --> 26:00.299
Second impact, three, two, one.

26:01.969 --> 26:05.771
Commander Warnick, I'm
curious as to your thoughts?

26:06.707 --> 26:09.375
Third
payload impact in 15 seconds.

26:12.947 --> 26:15.180
Fourth payload, 10 seconds.

26:17.351 --> 26:21.420
Impact in four, three, two, one.

26:31.165 --> 26:33.732
All right, we have two units
left.

26:33.734 --> 26:36.068
I'm gonna contact our
early command centers

26:36.070 --> 26:37.403
on a possible fail.

26:39.073 --> 26:41.707
Two more units, only
one has a signal, sir.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.042
Location's further north.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.747
They may have taken high winds,
sir.

26:51.285 --> 26:54.219
10 seconds on five.

26:58.292 --> 27:03.362
Four, three, two, one.

27:03.764 --> 27:05.197
Touchdown.

27:31.392 --> 27:34.827
We have one unit unaccounted
for, sir.

27:34.829 --> 27:35.894
No signal.

27:37.098 --> 27:39.147
Keep your eyes open,

27:39.149 --> 27:41.199
I'll call in a Hawk, see
if they can spot something.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.267
Yes, sir.

27:43.971 --> 27:45.904
Where, oh where could they be?

27:50.111 --> 27:51.176
Sir?

28:08.362 --> 28:09.495
A toast to my friend.

28:11.232 --> 28:16.235
To a new third world power,
I have my rockets engaged,

28:16.237 --> 28:19.204
I have the Americans and
the world fearing us.

28:19.206 --> 28:22.374
Alfred, how can those
rockets not run low on fuel?

28:22.376 --> 28:24.143
Do they even work?

28:26.547 --> 28:29.181
We are at the brink of World War
III.

28:30.818 --> 28:32.317
You're right.

28:35.022 --> 28:38.457
Let's hope this brilliant
idea of yours is a success.

28:50.137 --> 28:52.070
Wait, don't shoot, don't!

29:01.849 --> 29:03.364
What is it?

29:03.366 --> 29:04.882
Sh, something's coming out of
it.

29:08.422 --> 29:10.289
Five confirmed drops, sir.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.090
We're still missing number six.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.329
Sir, look at the containers.

29:18.866 --> 29:22.267
Look at the deployed containers,
look at them popping up.

29:22.269 --> 29:26.405
One and two, three confirmed,
sir.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.142
Have you ever thought that
dropping these containers,

29:30.144 --> 29:32.411
General, might cause
them to use their nukes?

29:46.861 --> 29:48.660
Hey, what are they saying?

29:48.662 --> 29:50.462
They believe
the missiles are obsolete.

29:50.464 --> 29:54.132
They are older Russian
units, not operational.

29:54.134 --> 29:57.035
That does not look
non-operational.

29:58.873 --> 29:59.938
It's a bluff.

30:00.574 --> 30:01.640
It's possible.

30:01.642 --> 30:06.245
You willing to risk your
life on that commander?

30:06.247 --> 30:07.312
Yes.

30:08.382 --> 30:11.116
Well, God help us all.

30:11.118 --> 30:13.218
Lieutenant, deploy the payloads.

30:13.220 --> 30:14.453
Deploy 'em.

30:14.455 --> 30:16.121
Deploy!

30:16.123 --> 30:17.956
Chop, chop.

30:51.025 --> 30:53.158
Overhead view.

30:53.160 --> 30:57.229
Command, it looks like
biologic's been deployed.

30:59.166 --> 31:03.168
Mr. President, the launch is
underway.

31:03.170 --> 31:06.705
That, that's the head
cam from the hybrid.

31:06.707 --> 31:08.440
Container number
six.

31:08.442 --> 31:11.043
Mr. President, I will
call you right back.

31:38.439 --> 31:41.273
Is that what I think
it is?

31:41.275 --> 31:43.308
That is the command post.

31:46.013 --> 31:48.080
It looks like the leader.

31:50.384 --> 31:53.719
Thing have a gun on its head?

31:53.721 --> 31:54.987
Yes.

31:57.191 --> 31:58.256
Fire.

32:42.269 --> 32:44.136
I've got six active, sir.

32:44.138 --> 32:45.737
Looks like all weapons are
online.

32:48.375 --> 32:50.075
President online, sir.

32:50.077 --> 32:51.176
Onscreen.

32:53.047 --> 32:56.815
Hello, General, I assume
our plan is moving forward.

32:56.817 --> 32:58.617
Surprisingly well, Mr.
President.

32:58.619 --> 33:00.485
I knew it would work.

33:00.487 --> 33:02.587
I never lose on good deals.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.689
All deals love me.

33:06.293 --> 33:09.594
We're in good hands with
experts, General.

33:09.596 --> 33:13.265
And let me tell you, in
my 16 years of president,

33:13.267 --> 33:16.401
I've never had a raw deal.

33:16.403 --> 33:18.403
I've raw dogged, but not a raw
deal.

33:18.405 --> 33:20.472
That's good to hear, Mr.
President.

33:20.474 --> 33:21.540
Update?

33:21.542 --> 33:26.144
Well, our weapons have
actually infiltrated a fortress

33:26.146 --> 33:29.614
and we're beginning to see a
lot of activity in the region.

33:30.551 --> 33:35.620
By infiltrated, General, how
does that work with missiles?

33:36.090 --> 33:38.090
I don't understand your
question, sir.

33:38.092 --> 33:39.491
Missiles don't infiltrate.

33:40.694 --> 33:42.160
Sir, maybe you don't
understand.

33:42.162 --> 33:45.230
We're using biologics as
weapons.

33:45.799 --> 33:47.299
Biologics, sir.

33:47.301 --> 33:49.568
Now why the fuck didn't
anybody tell me that?

33:49.570 --> 33:51.269
We did, sir.

33:51.271 --> 33:52.437
Who are you?

33:52.439 --> 33:54.573
I'm Colonel Sanders, sir.

33:54.575 --> 33:57.576
How did a guy who sells fried
chicken

33:57.578 --> 33:59.578
end up running the show?

33:59.580 --> 34:02.347
You're fried with ranch!

34:02.349 --> 34:04.850
Mr. President, I don't
think this is a good time...

34:04.852 --> 34:07.285
I'll tell you what time it is.

34:09.189 --> 34:10.304
And do you know why?

34:10.306 --> 34:11.422
'Cause my time is excellent,
that's why.

34:13.293 --> 34:14.593
Gotta go.

34:27.141 --> 34:27.472
So, little 'vert.

34:27.474 --> 34:27.806
How do you guys decide who takes
the top

34:27.808 --> 34:29.674
and who takes the bottom?

34:29.676 --> 34:33.745
Foreplay, maybe a little
paper, rock, scissors,

34:33.747 --> 34:36.681
get it.

34:36.683 --> 34:39.384
Just kidding, 'cause you're
so quiet, boring me out here.

34:40.354 --> 34:42.354
You guys have families, right?

34:42.356 --> 34:47.292
Wives, maybe boyfriends.

34:48.562 --> 34:51.763
It's okay, hey, did you
know that sex in the...

34:51.765 --> 34:53.932
The General is ready to see
you.

34:56.236 --> 34:57.302
Bring him.

34:57.304 --> 35:01.339
But, anal sex, it'll
make your whole week.

35:01.341 --> 35:02.741
Watch him.

35:02.743 --> 35:03.608
Get it?

35:03.610 --> 35:04.676
Your whole week.

35:26.266 --> 35:28.366
Enough!

35:28.368 --> 35:29.434
Really?

35:31.572 --> 35:32.971
Does it have to be John?

35:35.409 --> 35:37.842
Well, he's a misogynistic jack,

35:38.679 --> 35:41.379
oh, and we're live from Capital
Hill.

35:42.949 --> 35:44.516
I stand here atop
this shanty looking down

35:44.518 --> 35:46.885
upon the destruction below.

35:47.955 --> 35:50.855
Government officials have urged
that any

35:50.857 --> 35:53.758
and all citizens evacuate the
premises as soon as possible.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.860
And the presence of
unruliness has escalated

35:55.862 --> 35:58.863
and the country's replacement
government,

35:58.865 --> 36:02.601
capable of nuclear warfare, well

36:02.603 --> 36:04.836
they're nowhere to be heard of.

36:04.838 --> 36:07.505
No word from the as of yet, on
any level.

36:07.507 --> 36:11.476
John Jacobs, Nightwatch, Stella
back on.

36:16.250 --> 36:17.649
Hey, what is that?

36:17.651 --> 36:18.783
Yeah, right there.

36:31.832 --> 36:33.798
Get that stuff off his head.

36:35.335 --> 36:37.002
Hey, whoa, whoa.

36:37.004 --> 36:38.903
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:41.308 --> 36:43.541
Well, apparently you
both know each other.

36:50.584 --> 36:51.616
He's Billy, he's joke.

36:51.618 --> 36:53.351
What's up, governor.

36:53.353 --> 36:54.919
You put a bullet to Mike, like
you.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.488
- You two know each other.
- Yeah, we know each other.

36:56.490 --> 36:57.889
This son of a bitch lost a bet
to me

36:57.891 --> 36:59.758
and now he thinks I cheated him.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.659
Hey.

37:01.661 --> 37:03.561
He stole a secret Russian
weapon in development.

37:04.631 --> 37:06.564
You can't hide forever, Yankee.

37:12.739 --> 37:15.640
What the hell is
this?

37:15.642 --> 37:17.509
Cosmic air gel.

37:17.511 --> 37:20.378
It's a protein serum that
allows dinosaurs to live.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.480
They can't live without it.

37:22.482 --> 37:24.949
It a fail safe to prevent
overpopulation.

37:27.054 --> 37:29.387
It was in his backpack when he
was cuffed.

37:29.389 --> 37:31.089
The property of the Russians.

37:32.993 --> 37:35.727
Your dinos bio, it's gonna
fail.

37:35.729 --> 37:37.829
You put that out in an
environment where it can spread?

37:37.831 --> 37:40.498
It's gonna be like the
black plague with the rats.

37:41.401 --> 37:44.803
That's why the protein
serum was developed.

37:44.805 --> 37:47.472
You can't
create and thrive a species

37:47.474 --> 37:49.774
and expect the virus not to
spread.

37:49.776 --> 37:51.810
Sure it looks pretty on the
outside.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.779
Who doesn't like a cute cuddly
dinosaur running around?

37:54.781 --> 37:58.450
Eventually, it's just
gonna bit you in the ass.

37:59.119 --> 38:02.754
And quite frankly,
probably, literally yours.

38:21.842 --> 38:22.974
Dale, Paul!

38:24.778 --> 38:27.645
Crazy.

38:35.155 --> 38:36.521
It is coming.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.526
Do you see it?

38:42.629 --> 38:43.962
Sh, quiet.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.869
It is coming, do not make a
sound.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.784
Perhaps he will
leave.

39:51.665 --> 39:53.865
Sir, we have a situation.

39:53.867 --> 39:56.183
What is it?

39:56.185 --> 39:58.502
It's the biologics, their
lifelines are disappearing.

39:58.505 --> 40:00.020
What?

40:00.022 --> 40:01.538
Each life unit has a GPS
system

40:01.541 --> 40:05.076
that's equipped with a
monitor on their life status.

40:05.912 --> 40:09.013
These are signifying
terminations.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.548
They're dying?

40:10.550 --> 40:12.016
Yes,
sir, but the good news is

40:12.018 --> 40:14.085
there seems to be a
reduction on what appears

40:14.087 --> 40:16.554
to be a virus signature, sir.

40:16.556 --> 40:17.956
So they're dying.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.824
That's impossible.

40:19.826 --> 40:22.026
That's not what the
screens show, Officer.

40:23.230 --> 40:26.798
It's not over, this here,
this is just the beginning.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.601
What makes you so expert, ass
admirer?

40:29.603 --> 40:32.003
That's cute, friend.

40:33.006 --> 40:35.607
Listen, I was hired to observe

40:35.609 --> 40:38.910
and monitor this from
the beginning by the CIS.

40:38.912 --> 40:40.278
Anybody familiar with that?

40:41.114 --> 40:43.248
The Command of International
Security.

40:43.250 --> 40:46.551
Now listen, I've seen
what this weapon can do.

40:46.553 --> 40:50.188
And our best option is to
destroy them all

40:50.190 --> 40:52.190
before they destroy us.

40:52.192 --> 40:54.859
You know nothing about
science.

40:54.861 --> 40:56.661
That's cute,
sweetheart.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.263
Listen, you've been fed
nothing but bullshit

40:58.265 --> 41:00.098
from your upper command.

41:00.100 --> 41:03.668
In fact, you're nothing
more than a cute salesman,

41:03.670 --> 41:06.971
here to deliver the extinction
of the humankind via

41:06.973 --> 41:07.872
what was it again?

41:07.874 --> 41:10.208
Oh, yeah, Trumpodine.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.676
I've heard of.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.260
That I've heard of.

41:13.262 --> 41:14.845
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what the hell is Trumpodine.

41:14.848 --> 41:16.581
Sir, president
on queue.

41:23.723 --> 41:27.992
Gentlemen, ladies, as you know
by now,

41:27.994 --> 41:32.163
the Russian's weapons seem
to be working and well.

41:32.165 --> 41:34.065
As I thought, of course.

41:34.067 --> 41:37.735
The missiles seem to have
reached their objectives.

41:39.072 --> 41:42.073
They're biological
weapons, Mr. President.

41:42.075 --> 41:44.609
Hey, I though I fired you.

41:45.645 --> 41:48.913
You son of bitch threw
a fireball up his ass.

41:48.915 --> 41:50.782
What, what's going on?

41:50.784 --> 41:53.051
Wait a minute, who's that?

41:53.053 --> 41:55.320
You son of a bitch, how dare
you.

41:55.322 --> 41:57.989
You insult my country
and you want to fight me?

41:57.991 --> 42:00.658
If I could I'd put your ass
in a, I'd rather kill you!

42:00.660 --> 42:02.060
You can choke on this.

42:02.062 --> 42:03.094
You're fired.

42:03.096 --> 42:04.929
Oh, you want some of this?

42:04.931 --> 42:06.130
This African sweet boy?

42:13.807 --> 42:17.342
I gave your country money,
not you, you fuckin' moron.

42:17.344 --> 42:19.644
Mr. President, I need your
attention!

42:20.347 --> 42:22.313
I think we have a developing
problem, sir?

42:22.315 --> 42:24.816
What, this better be good,
General.

42:24.818 --> 42:25.283
It's not.

43:16.269 --> 43:17.335
Whoa!

43:22.909 --> 43:23.975
Whoa, yeah!

43:45.999 --> 43:47.999
Come on.

45:28.401 --> 45:30.134
How dare you speak to me that
way!

45:30.136 --> 45:31.402
You live in that luxury
apartment,

45:31.404 --> 45:32.769
or wherever the hell it is,

45:32.771 --> 45:34.137
while I sit here and live in
ruins!

45:34.140 --> 45:35.439
We're in a time of war.

45:36.543 --> 45:39.343
And I'm working out of a
basement.

45:39.345 --> 45:41.279
Do you see my complaining?

45:41.281 --> 45:42.547
Why won't you move your camera
back

45:42.549 --> 45:45.349
and let me see how
basementy your place is.

45:46.419 --> 45:47.952
What?

45:47.954 --> 45:49.253
Show me!

45:49.255 --> 45:50.488
I ain't gonna show you shit.

45:50.490 --> 45:52.956
Show me you son of bitch!

45:52.958 --> 45:55.425
No, I'm not letting you into
my basement, General Shoke.

45:55.428 --> 45:58.296
You son of bitch, from a
cracker of your mama's ass.

45:58.298 --> 45:59.363
Show me!

46:00.567 --> 46:05.837
Oh, you want some of this!

46:08.041 --> 46:10.141
You son of a bitch, you take
that!

46:10.143 --> 46:12.910
You insult my country and my
people!

46:12.912 --> 46:14.045
Take this!

46:14.047 --> 46:16.235
You runnin' a piece of
face!

46:16.237 --> 46:18.425
You doggy
paddle, you can't undo that.

46:18.427 --> 46:20.616
Oh, that's what that
word is used for, your face!

46:23.389 --> 46:25.356
You haven't
seen this since the '80s.

46:25.358 --> 46:26.857
Has anybody told you

46:26.859 --> 46:28.359
that the skin color of your
face look like baby poo.

46:28.361 --> 46:30.027
Bring it, pussy.

46:34.968 --> 46:36.033
Come on.

46:49.115 --> 46:50.581
Over here.

46:55.021 --> 46:56.621
What you got, Abe?

47:00.493 --> 47:01.559
Where's Borge?

47:09.636 --> 47:13.304
50 yards away, not a soul was
breathing.

47:14.974 --> 47:16.040
Huh?

47:17.577 --> 47:22.647
Haiti, man, 1994, changed to
democracy.

47:24.918 --> 47:28.653
They drived us into a
field of death.

47:30.156 --> 47:31.222
Could smell the rot.

47:32.425 --> 47:33.925
Thought it was over then.

47:35.028 --> 47:36.260
You think this is over?

47:38.698 --> 47:41.098
Tired of these boring ass
gigs.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.500
I need action!

47:42.502 --> 47:44.068
Careful what you wish for.

48:10.430 --> 48:12.630
Come on, "Call of Duty"!

48:17.170 --> 48:19.236
Come on, "Call of Duty"!

48:29.382 --> 48:32.049
What is that, a Nerf gun?

49:06.719 --> 49:09.220
What the hell
man, what was that?

49:14.027 --> 49:15.259
Well, I told ya.

49:17.263 --> 49:20.698
Yeah look, who's acting crazy
now?

49:20.700 --> 49:22.400
Crazy?

49:25.171 --> 49:26.219
I'm crazy?

49:26.221 --> 49:27.270
I'm gonna walk away before I
really spin.

49:30.510 --> 49:35.579
♪ And I gotta have my way now,
baby ♪

49:36.349 --> 49:38.549
♪ All I know is that ♪

50:17.423 --> 50:18.823
Looks like you guys
might have a dino problem

50:18.825 --> 50:20.091
on your hands.

50:29.135 --> 50:31.469
Well where else do you
think we should put it?

50:31.471 --> 50:33.204
Why don't you bend
over and I'll show ya.

50:33.206 --> 50:36.874
Hey, you have a lot of
nerve talking to me like that.

50:38.578 --> 50:40.478
I wasn't talkin' to you.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.545
Stop!

51:11.711 --> 51:16.780
There's a protein in your
weapons that attracts the virus.

51:17.683 --> 51:20.284
The virus gets bigger and it
spreads.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.354
Those of us who have actually
gotten out

51:23.356 --> 51:24.522
of elementary school

51:24.524 --> 51:28.592
know that the black
plague was spread by rats.

51:28.594 --> 51:31.795
What do you suppose is
spreading the virus today?

51:33.299 --> 51:34.365
Your dinosaurs.

51:41.240 --> 51:42.856
Twizzle?

51:42.858 --> 51:44.475
So, you made
our situation worse.

51:44.477 --> 51:46.477
Yeah, smooth move, ex-lax.

51:46.479 --> 51:47.711
But yes.

51:47.713 --> 51:49.713
We should
have used nukes, sir.

51:50.550 --> 51:51.815
We can destroy this one

51:52.818 --> 51:54.885
but what about the other ones
out there?

51:55.955 --> 51:58.489
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job, General.

51:58.491 --> 52:02.193
But yeah, nuke 'em, erase 'em
all!

52:02.195 --> 52:04.929
Yes.

52:07.433 --> 52:08.566
What did he say?

52:08.568 --> 52:11.202
Oh, ah, he said that we are,

52:12.705 --> 52:17.208
how do you say, we are going
to die, we're all gonna die.

52:17.210 --> 52:20.544
Kaput, finito, total completo.

52:32.725 --> 52:37.661
To overcome one must become
open minded.

52:38.598 --> 52:42.700
And to do that, well, you
gotta think outside of the box.

52:48.507 --> 52:51.375
In there, I feel something.

52:51.377 --> 52:56.447
I think I got it.

52:58.351 --> 53:00.317
Ew, dino shit.

53:00.319 --> 53:02.353
Are you out of your friggin'
mind?

53:02.355 --> 53:03.420
Come here.

53:04.457 --> 53:05.522
Come here!

53:06.859 --> 53:09.260
Abe, Borge, walk away.

53:09.895 --> 53:12.863
Look man, dogs don't eat their
own shit.

53:12.865 --> 53:15.299
So a dinosaur's not going to
either.

53:15.301 --> 53:17.334
We become poop proof.

53:17.336 --> 53:19.470
This ain't no freakin' game
show, man.

53:19.472 --> 53:21.338
You lead by example.

53:21.340 --> 53:23.274
You at least owe your team that
much.

53:24.744 --> 53:27.044
You're fallin' off the edge,
man.

53:27.046 --> 53:28.345
Off the edge?

53:28.347 --> 53:29.880
Seems like it, yeah.

53:29.882 --> 53:33.017
Man, I am nowhere near an
edge.

53:33.019 --> 53:35.586
You're a nut that's crumblin',
man.

53:35.588 --> 53:39.356
Fine, so, poop camo a bad
idea.

53:39.358 --> 53:40.858
But I'll tell ya what's a better
idea,

53:40.860 --> 53:44.028
disguise ourselves as
zombies, much, much better,

53:44.030 --> 53:46.897
more efficient, it's more
sanitary,

53:46.899 --> 53:47.965
we're not gonna get
ghona-sypha-herpelaids

53:47.967 --> 53:49.366
from these dinosaurs.

53:49.368 --> 53:51.702
So you think bein' a zombie is
gonna be

53:51.704 --> 53:53.837
a better idea to save us?

53:56.575 --> 53:57.974
Yep.

53:57.976 --> 53:59.376
So you're willin 'to go full
zombie,

53:59.378 --> 54:01.011
thinkin' that'll divert the real
zombies

54:01.013 --> 54:02.579
from eatin' your brains out?

54:04.717 --> 54:08.452
But when the real zombie does
come and eats your brains out,

54:08.454 --> 54:10.921
then the whole zombie diversion
thing wasn't really worth it

54:10.923 --> 54:13.590
in the first place, see
what I'm sayin', brother?

54:14.860 --> 54:18.529
Works in the movies, but not in
real life.

54:18.531 --> 54:20.331
Never go full zombie, man.

54:25.871 --> 54:27.338
And I'm no where near an edge!

55:33.139 --> 55:34.905
We have a problem,
sir.

55:34.907 --> 55:36.322
Come again?

55:36.324 --> 55:37.740
We regret to inform you that
the weapons

55:37.743 --> 55:40.411
in use are great piles of crap,
sir.

55:41.480 --> 55:44.047
They're not crap, you're crap.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.083
Colonel, you picked one hell
of a time

55:46.085 --> 55:47.484
to announce an opinion.

55:48.754 --> 55:49.820
Go ahead.

55:50.923 --> 55:52.523
These weapons are turning

55:52.525 --> 55:54.892
into the very things they're
eating.

55:54.894 --> 55:56.493
What?

55:56.495 --> 55:59.763
Well they eat the disease,
they become the disease.

55:59.765 --> 56:01.031
That's impossible.

56:01.033 --> 56:03.700
They have a specific
gene that cannot mutate.

56:04.637 --> 56:06.703
Yeah, unless that's
altered.

56:09.175 --> 56:10.707
Easy there, gentlemen.

56:14.046 --> 56:17.781
This is the T1 gene mutating
compound.

56:17.783 --> 56:19.516
I found this on one of
your commandos out there

56:19.518 --> 56:20.517
in the field.

56:20.519 --> 56:22.268
He was using it.

56:22.270 --> 56:24.020
For what, you already
have a sick science project.

56:24.023 --> 56:25.522
Yeah, that's correct.

56:25.524 --> 56:28.926
And when you create an
ambulatory biologic,

56:28.928 --> 56:31.528
no matter what, nothing can
destroy it.

56:31.530 --> 56:33.931
The carnivorous become more
carnivorous.

56:33.933 --> 56:37.134
The ferocious, they become more
ferocious.

56:38.804 --> 56:41.805
You think we're safe?

56:42.675 --> 56:43.740
Yeah, think again.

56:43.742 --> 56:47.177
This stuff lies dormant
in every single one of us.

56:47.179 --> 56:49.746
It's just waiting for
something to jump start it.

56:49.748 --> 56:51.148
Something just like this.

56:51.150 --> 56:53.217
So you mean one of our
operatives has that out

56:53.219 --> 56:54.485
in the field?

56:55.688 --> 56:56.753
That's right.

56:59.625 --> 57:00.924
Aren't these guys screened?

57:00.926 --> 57:03.093
Seriously, for an operation like
this,

57:03.095 --> 57:05.128
there should be more control
measures.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.165
It's the
president, sir.

57:10.836 --> 57:11.902
Put him on.

57:11.904 --> 57:16.573
I understand we're having
some issues on the war front?

57:17.877 --> 57:20.944
But let me assure you,
we have countermeasure

57:20.946 --> 57:23.947
in place to ensure our success.

57:23.949 --> 57:25.682
Right now, Mr. President,

57:25.684 --> 57:30.220
we're seeing a foreshadowing
of human extinction.

57:30.222 --> 57:35.292
Our biologics may be our
biggest problem as yet.

57:35.794 --> 57:38.962
General, that's why we have
specialists

57:38.964 --> 57:40.631
to ensure that doesn't happen.

57:46.788 --> 57:48.705
Direct orders to pull out
from upper command, stop.

57:50.009 --> 57:52.910
We haven't even completed the
mission yet.

57:52.912 --> 57:54.945
Who the hell is sending these
messages?

57:57.049 --> 58:00.217
Man, we ain't goin' anywhere.

58:02.788 --> 58:03.921
What?

58:03.923 --> 58:06.890
You think they're gonna
risk an aircraft for us

58:06.892 --> 58:07.958
at this point?

58:18.771 --> 58:21.171
What kind of cigarette you
smokin'?

58:21.173 --> 58:22.239
Not a cigarette.

58:24.777 --> 58:26.310
Well, it's a tiny ass cigar.

58:28.714 --> 58:29.780
Nope.

58:33.052 --> 58:35.052
You smokin' marijuana around
my team?

58:36.789 --> 58:39.890
Calm down, it's a special
formulation.

58:45.064 --> 58:46.597
That is so wrong.

58:48.667 --> 58:51.935
Not wrong, Jesus smoked it
too.

58:51.937 --> 58:53.236
No, he didn't.

58:53.238 --> 58:54.805
You take that back!

59:28.107 --> 59:29.673
Men, fire!

59:33.112 --> 59:34.378
We are under attack!

1:00:17.690 --> 1:00:19.222
Borge, cover, now!

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.727
Driver, exit the truck!

1:00:24.697 --> 1:00:26.296
Exit the truck now, driver!

1:00:30.703 --> 1:00:33.837
How do you say, exit the truck
in African?

1:01:16.482 --> 1:01:18.148
Earn those Cubans?

1:01:19.284 --> 1:01:21.485
What are you doing here?

1:01:34.833 --> 1:01:36.500
Access denied.

1:01:36.502 --> 1:01:37.501
Dammit.

1:01:37.503 --> 1:01:39.269
Access denied.

1:01:39.271 --> 1:01:41.538
Dammit, open this
damn door!

1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:45.475
Sir, you need to gently
insert all of your fingers.

1:01:45.477 --> 1:01:47.377
Access granted.

1:02:06.899 --> 1:02:10.000
Now I want that thing
destroyed now!

1:02:10.002 --> 1:02:12.135
I'm afraid it's not that easy,
Colonel.

1:02:12.137 --> 1:02:14.704
What are you talking about?

1:02:14.706 --> 1:02:17.274
You open the doors and
you blow the thing apart.

1:02:20.412 --> 1:02:24.414
She's right, you've got
a serious problem up there.

1:02:24.416 --> 1:02:27.951
We've got enough firepower
to do the job right.

1:02:30.856 --> 1:02:32.556
Now I think there's more to
you than you're letting on.

1:02:32.558 --> 1:02:35.025
You should speak now or live to
regret it.

1:02:35.027 --> 1:02:36.293
Colonel, no!

1:02:36.295 --> 1:02:38.028
You know who's in charge here!

1:02:38.997 --> 1:02:40.964
What's your story, Billy?

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:46.169
You open that door, none
of us are gonna survive.

1:02:47.005 --> 1:02:49.906
Abbot, Costello, open the box.

1:02:51.210 --> 1:02:53.243
Open the damn box!

1:02:54.346 --> 1:02:57.214
Bet you're proud of committing
treason against your country.

1:02:59.518 --> 1:03:00.984
What are you pompous or
something?

1:03:00.986 --> 1:03:03.954
You think I created this thing
for war.

1:03:03.956 --> 1:03:05.488
I'm willing to bet

1:03:05.490 --> 1:03:07.022
the Russians gave you a lot of
money,

1:03:07.024 --> 1:03:08.557
made you feel different about
your little science project.

1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:10.627
No, but maybe for a partner.

1:03:22.107 --> 1:03:24.040
Dammit, I can't see!

1:03:24.943 --> 1:03:26.476
Who do you think you are,
putting a gun to my head?

1:03:26.478 --> 1:03:28.545
Don't you know I am the general?

1:03:28.547 --> 1:03:32.282
Don't you guys have any
paved roads around here?

1:03:43.161 --> 1:03:45.595
Get over on the left.

1:03:45.597 --> 1:03:47.297
Get over on the left!

1:03:47.299 --> 1:03:49.532
Damn it, I still can't see!

1:03:49.534 --> 1:03:51.301
Grab a rope!

1:04:10.122 --> 1:04:13.189
Take that you bad bastard.

1:04:13.191 --> 1:04:14.524
So long, sucker.

1:04:50.262 --> 1:04:53.330
As I was saying, nothing
personal.

1:05:02.574 --> 1:05:04.708
You really piss me off, boy.

1:05:04.710 --> 1:05:07.644
You stupid, Yankee,
you're gonna kill us all!

1:05:09.181 --> 1:05:10.046
Do you know what you're doing?

1:05:10.048 --> 1:05:11.313
Hey, you know they saying,

1:05:11.315 --> 1:05:12.581
"What doesn't hurt you,
makes you stronger."

1:05:12.584 --> 1:05:14.417
This does not apply here.

1:05:14.419 --> 1:05:16.119
Dead means dead.

1:05:16.121 --> 1:05:19.055
Stupid son of a bitch.

1:05:29.701 --> 1:05:32.202
We have an active
breach in the hanger, sir.

1:05:56.395 --> 1:05:59.562
Damn, get a squad to
cover that area right now.

1:06:00.432 --> 1:06:01.564
Get them over there.

1:06:34.599 --> 1:06:37.200
Where'd everybody go?

1:06:37.202 --> 1:06:38.334
Hello, hello?

1:10:04.909 --> 1:10:06.876
Hey, can't you stop that
thing?

1:10:06.878 --> 1:10:07.977
No, the system was down.

1:10:07.979 --> 1:10:09.846
It is running on its own,
offline.

1:10:09.848 --> 1:10:12.515
Offline, does that look
offline to you?

1:10:12.517 --> 1:10:13.650
How's it doing that?

1:10:13.652 --> 1:10:16.953
Lizard here,
die, now I'm in charge.

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.459
Whoa.

1:10:23.461 --> 1:10:25.295
Awesome, bro, that was cool.

1:10:27.032 --> 1:10:29.065
Well, that's the last time you
eat gravy

1:10:29.067 --> 1:10:31.334
now that you are gravy.

1:10:32.737 --> 1:10:34.037
I mean, very sad, very sad.

1:10:34.039 --> 1:10:35.972
Call in air support.

1:10:35.974 --> 1:10:38.608
Two steps ahead of you, I
already did.

1:10:38.610 --> 1:10:39.676
Sharp kid.

1:10:40.445 --> 1:10:42.045
You'll make a good leader
someday.

1:10:43.648 --> 1:10:44.714
There they are.

1:10:45.750 --> 1:10:46.816
12:00 o'clock.

1:10:54.926 --> 1:10:56.759
Target 10:00 o'clock
low.

1:10:59.864 --> 1:11:01.798
Six, nine flight copy.

1:11:12.444 --> 1:11:16.446
Oh crap, that sucks.

1:11:19.351 --> 1:11:21.517
Altitude, altitude.

1:11:23.021 --> 1:11:25.421
Pull up, pull up, pull up.

1:11:31.563 --> 1:11:36.632
We shot our
entire crew in.

1:11:50.448 --> 1:11:53.549
Looks German, maybe
Russian.

1:11:57.122 --> 1:11:58.388
You sure?

1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:44.494
Do you got a light?

1:13:47.165 --> 1:13:48.231
Fun.

1:13:49.167 --> 1:13:50.233
Who's that?

1:13:54.672 --> 1:13:56.739
So you like to play with
lizards, right?

1:13:57.609 --> 1:14:00.076
What's that, an IED, a nuke?

1:14:03.014 --> 1:14:03.279
It's a missile you moron.

1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:11.721
You must be one of the
dumbest commandos I ever knew.

1:14:11.723 --> 1:14:13.656
Yeah, but not fully though,
right?

1:14:15.159 --> 1:14:16.292
Is that still active?

1:14:30.275 --> 1:14:31.541
Oh, no.

1:14:38.983 --> 1:14:40.850
He's banging his head against
it.

1:14:42.854 --> 1:14:43.920
Yeah, he does.

1:14:43.922 --> 1:14:48.824
What happens when you hit a
bullet on the top of the head

1:14:48.826 --> 1:14:50.192
for a long time?

1:14:53.064 --> 1:14:54.130
Oh, no!

1:14:55.266 --> 1:14:56.933
No!

1:15:30.735 --> 1:15:32.335
Don't look at me that way.

1:15:35.974 --> 1:15:37.239
I pay your salary.

1:15:38.076 --> 1:15:42.044
You can't even do your
job right, you're fired.

1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:50.987
What do you suppose is next?

1:15:53.992 --> 1:15:55.625
"Planet of the Apes" maybe.

1:15:57.061 --> 1:16:00.062
Thank you.

1:16:00.064 --> 1:16:01.998
That'll be somethin'.

1:23:34.819 --> 1:23:36.085
That

1:23:37.688 --> 1:23:38.821
was

1:23:40.724 --> 1:23:42.324
epic.

1:23:42.326 --> 1:23:44.193
You know what, you were right.

1:23:44.195 --> 1:23:45.427
That was good.

1:23:45.429 --> 1:23:46.762
We'll take it.

1:23:46.764 --> 1:23:47.863
- The comic?
- Mm-hmm.

1:23:47.865 --> 1:23:49.565
And.

1:23:49.567 --> 1:23:51.082
And?

1:23:51.084 --> 1:23:52.600
Our new
boyfriend.
