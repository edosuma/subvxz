00:03.586 --> 00:05.176
You are being watched.

00:05.177 --> 00:07.006
The government has a secret system...

00:07.007 --> 00:09.126
secret system...

00:09.127 --> 00:12.676
A system you asked for to keep you safe.

00:12.677 --> 00:17.086
A machine that spies on
you every hour of every day.

00:17.087 --> 00:20.046
You granted it the
power to see everything...

00:20.047 --> 00:24.876
to index, order, and control
the lives of ordinary people.

00:24.877 --> 00:28.046
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:28.047 --> 00:29.796
We don't.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.676
But to it, you are all irrelevant,

00:32.677 --> 00:36.176
victim or perpetrator,
if you stand in its way.

00:36.177 --> 00:37.395
We'll find you.

_

00:54.047 --> 00:55.296
Hey, Detective.

01:00.417 --> 01:03.817
Busy day directing traffic
into a river, Cocoa Puffs?

01:04.967 --> 01:06.716
No? Nothing?

01:06.717 --> 01:08.506
Hmm?

01:12.177 --> 01:14.376
I'm not in the mood.

01:14.377 --> 01:18.176
Guess stumbling on a pile
of bodies can ruin your day.

01:18.177 --> 01:19.046
Yeah.

01:19.047 --> 01:21.796
What do you know about that?

01:21.797 --> 01:24.126
At least you made it out
with your life, right?

01:24.127 --> 01:26.086
Yeah, my life and a pile of dust.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.506
Tunnel's too unstable
to retrieve any of the evidence.

01:28.507 --> 01:30.716
Department's gonna want to know
what I was doing there.

01:30.717 --> 01:34.546
Not sure what to tell them yet,
or who I can trust.

01:40.677 --> 01:42.546
Sorry to hear that.

01:42.547 --> 01:44.770
You know the story
behind this, don't you?

01:45.757 --> 01:48.086
Someone's killing people
and burying the proof.

01:48.087 --> 01:50.046
Why did you have me look
into that city planner?

01:50.047 --> 01:52.720
Did you know it was related
to Elias's partner, Bruce?

01:53.177 --> 01:54.336
About that.

01:57.587 --> 01:58.784
What's this?

01:59.717 --> 02:01.504
An exit strategy.

02:01.967 --> 02:04.336
For you and your son
to disappear off the grid,

02:04.337 --> 02:05.336
just in case.

02:05.337 --> 02:06.416
Just in case?

02:13.797 --> 02:15.722
It's my fault you're in here.

02:17.047 --> 02:20.026
I should have looked
into the city planner, not you.

02:20.547 --> 02:23.006
If you continue with this investigation,

02:23.007 --> 02:24.756
just remember,

02:24.757 --> 02:27.006
there's a reason John
and Harold are presumed dead.

02:32.837 --> 02:34.006
Mind if I take this?

02:39.007 --> 02:41.561
How many hours have you been
sitting out here now?

02:42.047 --> 02:43.256
How's he doing?

02:43.257 --> 02:46.626
Not bad, all things considered.

02:46.627 --> 02:49.586
Got a lot of questions you
and Harold aren't gonna answer.

02:50.007 --> 02:53.006
The only way to keep Lionel safe
is to keep him in the dark.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.101
Does Harold still feel the same way?

02:56.967 --> 02:58.466
Ask him yourself.

03:01.127 --> 03:03.296
Some army we've got, huh?

03:09.757 --> 03:13.486
I understand you and John
want to keep guard over Fusco,

03:14.047 --> 03:16.546
but the Machine
seems to think he's safe.

03:16.547 --> 03:18.216
Mr. Reese and I will both
feel better when we

03:18.217 --> 03:20.006
determine that for ourselves.

03:21.917 --> 03:24.336
We were so busy scrambling to catch up.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.466
Samaritan killed those people

03:26.467 --> 03:28.506
right under our noses.

03:30.677 --> 03:31.780
Well,

03:33.217 --> 03:34.940
we've found our footing now.

03:35.297 --> 03:38.126
Soon it will be time
for us to go on the offensive.

03:43.177 --> 03:44.916
I got to start my next mission.

03:44.917 --> 03:46.607
Got a matinee to catch.

03:47.217 --> 03:48.916
Take care, Ms. Groves.

04:05.547 --> 04:06.546
Wonderful show.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.796
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.416
I'll handle this mission.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.222
Will you just answer me about Shaw?

04:17.313 --> 04:19.716
_

04:19.716 --> 04:22.125
I just want to know if Shaw is still...

04:22.127 --> 04:25.176
AM 520, WKCP.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.716
No.

04:26.717 --> 04:30.006
Rerouting radio signals
into my cochlear implant

04:30.007 --> 04:31.745
is not an answer.

04:33.217 --> 04:36.376
I know it's dangerous
with you know who listening,

04:36.377 --> 04:39.796
but what's the point of having
an open artificial intelligence

04:39.797 --> 04:41.176
at your disposal

04:41.177 --> 04:43.836
if She's too afraid
to talk to you directly?

04:48.297 --> 04:51.896
Harold and I got you back up
and running.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.716
Now let's get back on track.

04:54.717 --> 04:58.966
We need to be actively looking
for Shaw's exact location.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.586
- Come in.
- Miss Durov?

05:02.587 --> 05:05.006
Please forgive my impertinence.

05:05.007 --> 05:06.609
My name is Vasily.

05:07.257 --> 05:10.352
I just wanted to tell you that
your performance today was...

05:10.917 --> 05:12.777
you are a revelation.

05:13.177 --> 05:15.376
I never imagined when I was
invited to the ballet that...

05:15.377 --> 05:17.836
You never should've accepted
that invitation.

05:17.837 --> 05:18.916
What?

05:18.917 --> 05:19.916
Get down.

05:21.377 --> 05:22.916
, Vasily.

05:25.967 --> 05:28.086
Those tickets weren't a bribe, Vasily.

05:28.087 --> 05:31.046
Your enemies lured you
into an assassination.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.836
Marry me.

05:46.877 --> 05:51.046
There. I have your number now.

05:51.047 --> 05:53.176
I may need something from you soon.

05:53.177 --> 05:54.296
I'll call you.

05:57.837 --> 05:59.836
Thanks for the flowers.

06:02.147 --> 06:07.916
_

06:07.917 --> 06:09.966
Until the late 1780s.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.586
Let's go.

06:11.587 --> 06:13.086
So the next stop

06:13.087 --> 06:16.796
is the lace-making demonstration
in the parlor.

06:16.797 --> 06:19.571
I don't see any backpack.

06:20.127 --> 06:21.756
Listen, I've waited long enough.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.578
No more roundabout instructions.

06:26.087 --> 06:29.006
Quit being a wimp and talk to me.

06:29.007 --> 06:30.176
Facility with...

06:30.177 --> 06:31.176
looked like Washington D.C....

06:31.177 --> 06:34.796
AM 520, WKCP.

06:34.797 --> 06:37.075
He can't stay on our heels forever.

06:37.337 --> 06:39.176
Shaw is out there somewhere.

06:40.340 --> 06:43.466
_

06:43.467 --> 06:46.586
How about over by the fireplace?

06:46.587 --> 06:49.916
Okay, and three, and two...

06:49.917 --> 06:51.586
Though this centuries-old house

06:51.587 --> 06:53.716
has been turned
into a tourist attraction,

06:53.717 --> 06:56.126
residual paranormal energy remains.

06:56.127 --> 06:59.586
This electromagnetic frequency
meter will help to determine

06:59.587 --> 07:02.815
whether the haunting rumors are true.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.586
- Cut.
- Great.

07:05.587 --> 07:07.126
You think they'll let us into the attic?

07:09.337 --> 07:12.466
You want me to get
the EMF meter in the backpack?

07:12.467 --> 07:14.510
Am I going ghost hunting?

07:17.127 --> 07:19.336
Or am I going Shaw hunting?

07:25.087 --> 07:27.006
I refuse to do one more mission

07:27.007 --> 07:30.176
until I know that what I'm doing
is going to lead me to Sameen.

07:30.177 --> 07:32.628
_

07:36.797 --> 07:40.046
Weird, I just got a text
from a random number.

07:40.047 --> 07:41.006
Hold on, guys.

07:41.007 --> 07:43.416
Maybe this is a message from beyond.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.336
"WKCP.

07:45.337 --> 07:46.416
"UFO.

07:46.417 --> 07:50.046
Find her. Run."

07:50.047 --> 07:52.006
What do you think it means?

07:52.007 --> 07:54.046
Got the backpack.
Gonna have to improvise.

08:05.757 --> 08:07.086
Hey there, UFO.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.626
How much for the shirt?

08:14.417 --> 08:16.916
Sure, we don't yet
have definitive proof,

08:16.917 --> 08:19.006
but based on the evidence,
we can't completely discount

08:19.007 --> 08:21.126
the existence of extraterrestrial life.

08:21.127 --> 08:25.546
You're listening to Mysterious
Transmissions on AM 520, WKCP.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.416
In a minute, we're gonna open
up the phone lines.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.916
I want to hear
what you've all been up to...

08:28.917 --> 08:31.086
You must be Brittany, right?

08:31.087 --> 08:33.296
Is that voice coming
from the speakers right now?

08:33.297 --> 08:35.126
Weird stuff you see on the streets?

08:35.126 --> 08:36.836
- Lights in the sky?
- Yes.

08:36.837 --> 08:38.506
Strange men showing up at your door

08:38.506 --> 08:39.916
asking questions
that don't make any sense?

08:43.256 --> 08:45.336
You must be here for the producer gig.

08:48.257 --> 08:50.170
Take me to your leader.

08:51.627 --> 08:53.126
Take a little break
here, and when we get back,

08:53.127 --> 08:54.546
we're gonna lift the veil together.

09:11.297 --> 09:12.626
No.

09:15.627 --> 09:17.546
Sameen, stop resisting!

09:17.547 --> 09:18.836
Hold still!

09:39.649 --> 09:41.068
Sunny skies for all of next week

09:41.069 --> 09:42.238
as the fall weather rolls in

09:42.239 --> 09:43.608
and temperatures start dropping.

09:43.609 --> 09:45.198
So his producer quits out of nowhere,

09:45.198 --> 09:47.027
and then his engineer quits.

09:47.028 --> 09:49.277
Max refused to cancel his show
for tonight,

09:49.278 --> 09:52.067
so luckily HR had your résumé on file,

09:52.068 --> 09:55.857
and you seem like you might be
as much of a kook as he is.

09:55.858 --> 09:57.349
No offense.

09:58.648 --> 09:59.840
None taken.

10:00.554 --> 10:02.933
You're listening
to Mysterious Transmissions,

10:02.934 --> 10:06.783
where we don't like the taste
of the lies they feed us.

10:07.184 --> 10:08.683
We have a super-sized show tonight.

10:08.684 --> 10:11.263
From sundown to sunup
I will be here with you

10:11.264 --> 10:14.353
talking conspiracies, paranormal,

10:14.354 --> 10:18.766
the strange things lying
just beyond our understanding.

10:19.394 --> 10:22.398
If anyone's ever mocked you
for asking questions,

10:22.998 --> 10:24.139
I'm here to listen.

10:24.971 --> 10:26.813
Coming to you from a humble studio

10:26.815 --> 10:28.104
halfway to the ionosphere,

10:28.105 --> 10:32.354
this is Max Greene on AM 520 WKCP.

10:32.354 --> 10:34.013
Mysterious Transmissions

10:34.014 --> 10:35.763
is brought to you
by the Coronet Hotel Group,

10:35.764 --> 10:37.513
your premier destination
for luxury hotel...

10:37.514 --> 10:40.143
- Hi there.
- Hey, Max.

10:40.144 --> 10:42.103
This is Rose, Susan's replacement.

10:42.104 --> 10:43.313
- Thanks, Brittany.
- Sure.

10:43.314 --> 10:44.960
You guys have fun.

10:45.087 --> 10:47.496
Call today to book
a stay with Coronet Hotel.

10:47.497 --> 10:49.086
Nice to meet you.

10:49.087 --> 10:50.473
Oh, pleasure's all mine.

10:50.474 --> 10:52.036
1-800-555-0195.

10:52.334 --> 10:55.346
- Nice outfit.
- Hmm, thanks.

10:55.347 --> 10:57.543
And we'll make the
burning smell go away.

10:57.544 --> 11:00.383
Now I know many of you are aware
that my long-time producer,

11:00.384 --> 11:03.293
Susan, quit out of the blue last night.

11:03.294 --> 11:05.833
Something about a bank error
in her favor.

11:05.834 --> 11:08.423
Anyway, we all wish her very well,

11:08.424 --> 11:10.105
but I'm here with my new producer,

11:10.106 --> 11:11.787
and if you'll all indulge me,

11:12.294 --> 11:14.333
I have a couple of questions for her.

11:14.334 --> 11:15.475
Headphones on.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.043
Rose is sitting across from
me right now wearing a shirt

11:18.044 --> 11:19.499
that says "They exist."

11:19.754 --> 11:21.123
I think we can all agree to that,

11:21.124 --> 11:22.757
but what about Fermi's Paradox, Rose?

11:22.999 --> 11:25.833
They exist, so where are they?

11:29.464 --> 11:33.463
I think non-human intelligence
is already here, Max.

11:33.464 --> 11:36.983
Most people are just too
oblivious to see it.

11:37.384 --> 11:39.173
Some think we haven't met
any intelligent life

11:39.174 --> 11:41.753
because it's all been destroyed
by a technological singularity.

11:41.754 --> 11:43.208
Thoughts?

11:44.174 --> 11:46.423
I think sooner rather than later,

11:46.424 --> 11:49.543
we're gonna find out
just how true that theory is.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.452
- Let's take some calls.

11:55.319 --> 11:56.593
Mysterious Transmissions.

11:56.618 --> 11:57.830
You see the trails across the sky.

11:57.855 --> 11:59.099
Mysterious Transmissions.

11:59.124 --> 12:00.336
Do you really think
tinfoil hats are that weird?

12:00.361 --> 12:01.303
Mysterious Transmissions.

12:01.332 --> 12:03.421
Have you really considered...

12:04.200 --> 12:05.989
Mysterious Transmissions.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.759
I want to talk to Max again.

12:07.847 --> 12:09.426
- What's your name?
- Warren Franco.

12:09.427 --> 12:10.668
He knows me.

12:12.637 --> 12:14.176
Okay, Warren.

12:14.177 --> 12:15.897
Let me put you on hold a minute.

12:22.057 --> 12:24.496
Okay, I've got our friend
Warren back on the line.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.846
I take it you haven't
finished with me yet?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.676
I need to properly explain myself.

12:28.677 --> 12:30.386
Chinese satellites are the real threat.

12:30.387 --> 12:32.136
- How so?
- Mind control waves.

12:32.137 --> 12:34.056
I've measured them.
They're real, and I think you

12:34.057 --> 12:36.016
don't want to listen because
they're controlling your mind

12:36.017 --> 12:37.386
as we speak.

12:37.387 --> 12:39.266
I don't think
anyone's controlling my mind,

12:39.267 --> 12:40.556
but anything is possible.

12:40.557 --> 12:42.016
Don't be patronizing.

12:42.017 --> 12:44.293
It makes you sound
like some kind of shill.

12:45.177 --> 12:47.056
I know when I'm in control,

12:47.057 --> 12:48.886
and these days I don't feel like I'm...

12:48.887 --> 12:50.766
- Root?
- Hey, big lug.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.426
Mind flashing your badge
and getting some info for me?

12:53.427 --> 12:55.676
- What are you doing?
- Searching for Shaw.

12:55.677 --> 12:57.636
Machine put me on a mission
that may lead to her.

12:57.637 --> 12:59.136
What can I do?

12:59.137 --> 13:02.346
I need help looking into someone
named Warren Franco.

13:02.347 --> 13:03.886
Who's that?

13:03.887 --> 13:05.886
Some nut who keeps calling
this radio show,

13:05.887 --> 13:08.466
Mysterious Transmissions on AM 520.

13:08.467 --> 13:11.466
You and Harold would like it.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.306
The host is more paranoid than we are.

13:13.307 --> 13:14.886
Are you working a number?

13:14.887 --> 13:16.726
Can't a girl ask her cop friend

13:16.727 --> 13:19.136
to look up a creepy guy without
getting the third degree?

13:19.137 --> 13:21.306
I just want to know
if this guy has anything

13:21.307 --> 13:23.136
to do with finding Sameen.

13:23.137 --> 13:25.846
- Okay. Be careful, Root.
- Thanks, John.

13:45.427 --> 13:48.636
Thought you were a real killer.

13:48.637 --> 13:50.096
Better not wet yourself...

14:01.967 --> 14:03.136
Left her alive?

14:06.097 --> 14:07.697
A bit worn down, are we?

14:08.967 --> 14:11.016
Just bored.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.096
You people need to get more
creative with these simulations.

14:14.097 --> 14:15.434
I agree.

14:15.807 --> 14:17.385
Shall we take another field trip?

14:17.967 --> 14:19.636
Oh, but it's so much fun

14:19.637 --> 14:22.056
getting you shot
a thousand different ways.

14:24.427 --> 14:26.193
Bandage Ms. Shaw's hands.

14:26.637 --> 14:28.766
Wouldn't want her getting
the car bloody.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.516
Mr. Reese, how's Detective Fusco?

14:40.517 --> 14:42.016
Still won't see me.

14:42.017 --> 14:44.136
Think you could help
me find info on someone?

14:44.137 --> 14:46.226
You know if I'm going to
help you with your cover job,

14:46.227 --> 14:48.966
I should request a stipend
from the NYPD.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.226
It's for Root.

14:50.227 --> 14:52.056
Is Ms. Groves working a number?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.096
You know how it is with her.

14:53.097 --> 14:54.136
What's the name?

14:54.137 --> 14:55.544
Warren Franco.

14:56.137 --> 14:59.806
Warren Franco, 5251 East 33rd.

14:59.807 --> 15:02.016
Looks like retired military.

15:02.017 --> 15:03.846
Currently unemployed.

15:03.847 --> 15:07.516
Did Ms. Groves say how Franco's
important to her mission?

15:07.517 --> 15:09.846
All I know is she's working
at a radio station,

15:09.847 --> 15:11.426
and he calls there a lot.

15:11.427 --> 15:13.846
- Which one?
- AM 520.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.016
Thanks, Finch.

15:17.267 --> 15:19.306
But it was your grandmother's
spirit the whole time?

15:19.307 --> 15:22.846
Oh, yeah. I just smile
whenever I hear that glass shatter.

15:22.847 --> 15:24.516
It just goes to show if we stop ignoring

15:24.517 --> 15:26.516
what is right in front of our faces,

15:26.517 --> 15:29.057
we might find the peace
we're looking for.

15:30.267 --> 15:31.886
Thank you for your story, Greta.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.926
Remember, everyone, just because
people tell you to shut up

15:34.927 --> 15:36.801
doesn't mean you have to listen.

15:37.097 --> 15:39.426
The things you believe,
the patterns you see,

15:39.427 --> 15:41.306
they're coming from somewhere,

15:41.307 --> 15:45.636
and if you need help making
sense of it, I'm here for you.

15:45.637 --> 15:47.226
Okay, I think it's time
for a little break.

15:47.227 --> 15:49.096
Then I will be back
with more of your calls.

15:49.097 --> 15:54.775
You're listening to Mysterious
Transmissions on AM 520 WKCP.

15:56.097 --> 15:57.266
Tomorrow only, come on in...

16:02.267 --> 16:06.721
Max, that guy earlier, Warren?

16:07.137 --> 16:09.556
Oh, he's harmless.
Been calling in for years.

16:09.557 --> 16:12.176
My listeners have a tendency
to get defensive.

16:12.177 --> 16:13.596
I can't fault them for that.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.435
Don't tell me
no one's ever called you crazy.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.226
I don't mind because I know I'm right.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.096
Well, you'll get no argument from me.

16:21.097 --> 16:23.096
Warren really doesn't have anyone.

16:23.097 --> 16:25.903
Plus, he knows what you and I both know.

16:27.137 --> 16:28.176
What's that?

16:28.177 --> 16:31.136
The world has gotten
pretty weird lately.

16:34.387 --> 16:36.136
He's been helping me with a project.

16:37.927 --> 16:38.824
Listen.

16:39.227 --> 16:42.096
Radio and now broadcast...

16:43.097 --> 16:44.886
- Interference?
- Yeah.

16:44.887 --> 16:48.386
Like when your cell phone rings
and it makes your speakers buzz.

16:48.387 --> 16:51.136
It's usually caused
by poorly set-up equipment,

16:51.137 --> 16:54.226
so when I heard it for the first
time a few weeks ago I just

16:54.227 --> 16:57.016
made a note to myself to talk
to the station technicians,

16:57.017 --> 17:00.766
but then I realized something.

17:00.767 --> 17:01.766
Listen.

17:04.847 --> 17:06.016
Duh-duh-duh.

17:06.017 --> 17:07.266
Duh-duh-duh.

17:07.267 --> 17:09.886
It's specific. Duh-duh-duh.

17:09.887 --> 17:12.549
It's a pattern, a code.

17:13.227 --> 17:16.096
- Morse code?
- No, it's proprietary.

17:16.097 --> 17:18.425
It's the kind of thing
where you need a special key.

17:18.426 --> 17:20.266
I showed it to Warren off the air,

17:20.267 --> 17:22.056
and he has cryptography training,

17:22.057 --> 17:23.346
and he didn't recognize it.

17:23.347 --> 17:25.675
Here, look.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.636
When you do the kind of work I do,

17:27.637 --> 17:30.886
steeping yourself
in conspiracy theories day in,

17:30.887 --> 17:34.176
day out, you get good
at recognizing patterns,

17:34.177 --> 17:36.176
and sometimes the patterns
are just coincidence,

17:36.177 --> 17:37.552
but sometimes...

17:38.847 --> 17:40.543
sometimes they're real.

17:41.677 --> 17:44.556
Tonight I'm announcing
this discovery on the air.

17:44.557 --> 17:46.466
I'm hoping my listeners
will help figure out

17:46.467 --> 17:49.886
what the messages mean
and who they're coming from.

17:52.267 --> 17:56.886
These messages are a secret
for a reason, Max.

17:56.887 --> 17:59.676
You sure whoever's doing this

17:59.677 --> 18:02.688
is gonna be happy you're
exposing them over the air?

18:03.727 --> 18:05.426
This is our chance to prove to the world

18:05.427 --> 18:07.128
that we're not crazy.

18:08.097 --> 18:09.556
I'm not gonna let that slip away.

18:13.847 --> 18:15.061
I got it.

18:16.033 --> 18:18.096
Mysterious Transmissions.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.676
It's Warren. I want to talk to Max.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.926
- Warren.
- Oh, yeah.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.363
One sec.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.226
Welcome back, skeptics.

18:27.227 --> 18:28.846
We have Warren back on the line.

18:28.847 --> 18:30.136
- They've done it.
- What do you mean?

18:30.137 --> 18:32.266
The Chinese. They're onto me.

18:32.267 --> 18:34.096
I can feel myself being controlled.

18:34.097 --> 18:35.675
What are they making you do?

18:36.517 --> 18:38.466
They're gonna make me kill myself.

18:40.967 --> 18:42.926
Okay, Warren, buddy, just take a second.

18:42.927 --> 18:44.676
No one can make you kill yourself.

18:44.677 --> 18:46.266
I have to, Max.

18:46.267 --> 18:47.466
I have to.

18:47.467 --> 18:49.266
You don't have to do anything.

18:49.267 --> 18:52.846
John, that guy Warren's on
the phone with Max right now.

18:52.847 --> 18:54.556
I think he's about to kill himself.

18:54.557 --> 18:56.346
I just reached his apartment.

18:56.347 --> 18:57.966
NYPD.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.266
Warren Franco?

19:08.097 --> 19:09.846
Don't see anyone here.

19:12.807 --> 19:15.176
I'm taking a look around.

19:15.177 --> 19:17.056
Where are you now, Warren?

19:17.057 --> 19:19.346
I don't remember
getting these pills, Max.

19:19.347 --> 19:20.966
Someone put them here.

19:20.967 --> 19:22.426
I just need to take a couple.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.306
Rose, I think we're gonna
have to call 911.

19:26.517 --> 19:27.516
Do you see him anywhere?

19:27.517 --> 19:29.926
Max is about to call 911.

19:31.597 --> 19:33.766
I think he's a little too late.

19:33.767 --> 19:35.136
Warren's already dead.

19:36.637 --> 19:38.096
Looks like a suicide,

19:38.097 --> 19:40.176
but this guy's been dead for hours.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.226
Note says this is Warren.

19:43.227 --> 19:44.556
Don't you dare talk down to me.

19:44.557 --> 19:45.636
Warren, listen.

19:45.637 --> 19:47.226
You have plenty to live for.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.556
Max is definitely still
talking to someone

19:49.557 --> 19:51.176
calling himself Warren.

19:51.177 --> 19:54.056
I just know what
they're telling me to do.

19:54.057 --> 19:56.386
Spent some time
working at the phone company.

19:56.387 --> 19:58.386
Let's see if my log-in
credentials still work.

19:58.387 --> 20:00.016
Okay.

20:00.017 --> 20:02.386
The call's originating from a landline

20:02.387 --> 20:03.596
in Warren's apartment.

20:03.597 --> 20:05.136
That's a spoofed call.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.136
Warren's voice, too.

20:07.137 --> 20:09.806
Someone using recordings
from his calls to Max

20:09.807 --> 20:12.056
to digitally recreate his speech.

20:12.057 --> 20:14.136
How'd this poor guy
earn a faked suicide?

20:14.137 --> 20:18.426
Max found a secret code
hidden in the radio signals

20:18.427 --> 20:21.426
and enlisted Warren
to help him decode it.

20:21.427 --> 20:23.726
Spoofed a call location,

20:23.727 --> 20:25.726
stole a man's voice.

20:25.727 --> 20:27.136
Then faked his suicide?

20:27.137 --> 20:28.766
Doing something important here.

20:28.767 --> 20:31.136
I think Max pissed off Samaritan.

20:31.137 --> 20:33.386
I didn't call you so
you could talk me out of it.

20:33.387 --> 20:35.636
- I called to warn you.
- Warn me?

20:35.637 --> 20:37.136
Yeah.

20:37.137 --> 20:38.226
You're next.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.425
Is Greer too busy to monologue today?

20:56.180 --> 20:58.599
Is that why he sent his mini-me

20:58.600 --> 21:01.179
to take me on a pretend field trip?

21:01.180 --> 21:04.219
Only Samaritan can save
the human race from itself.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.929
By eliminating key people,

21:05.930 --> 21:08.389
we can affect change
that will save countless lives.

21:08.390 --> 21:09.639
Butterfly flaps its wings,

21:09.640 --> 21:11.099
hurricane in China, blah, blah, blah.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.429
Can we just get
the simulation over with?

21:13.430 --> 21:14.599
Right this way.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.059
Here's the thing, John.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.179
Max plans to talk
about this code on the air,

21:23.180 --> 21:26.679
exposing Samaritan's means
of communication to the public.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.809
It's already killed one person
to keep its secret.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.160
I need to get Max
out of the station fast.

21:33.220 --> 21:34.099
I'm coming to help you.

21:34.719 --> 21:38.139
You need to stay away.
If Samaritan's after Max,

21:38.140 --> 21:40.269
you can't put your cover at risk.

21:40.270 --> 21:41.638
Besides,

21:42.270 --> 21:45.219
it thinks it's taking out
a nerdy talk show host.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.429
It's not expecting me.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.219
You know what, Warren?

21:48.220 --> 21:50.099
- Maybe you're right.
- Huh?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.929
Maybe it would be
better if we just killed ourselves.

21:52.930 --> 21:54.309
- What the...
- There's no place to hide, Max.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.099
Uh, that's not me.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.059
Death is our only sanctuary.

21:59.060 --> 22:00.479
What's going on?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.269
This is Max Greene on 520 WKCB.

22:02.270 --> 22:03.769
I got to go.

22:03.770 --> 22:05.099
This will be my last broadcast.

22:05.100 --> 22:06.889
Root? Damn it.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.719
Friends, the voice
you just heard is not me.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.929
I feel better. I was worried.

22:09.930 --> 22:11.519
Are we broadcasting?

22:11.520 --> 22:13.269
- That feeling is gone now.
- My board's down.

22:13.270 --> 22:14.719
Know what I'm talking about.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.099
If you can hear me, call the station.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.349
The phones too.

22:17.350 --> 22:18.559
I knew you'd come around, Max.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.179
Glad to hear you're going
to go through with this.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.269
Everything we've done in our lives...

22:25.270 --> 22:26.519
We're locked in.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.269
The mind control comes in waves.

22:30.270 --> 22:32.099
Sometimes I feel like I'm in control,

22:32.100 --> 22:34.099
and sometimes I don't, but...

22:34.100 --> 22:35.309
Target's with a co-worker.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.099
Roger that. Moving in.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.679
More and more I
feel like I've lost control.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.929
What is happening?

22:41.930 --> 22:44.179
It's a radio play.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.389
They're trying to make you
look nuts so no one bats an eye

22:46.390 --> 22:48.599
when you wind up dead.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.559
What? Who?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.309
Are there any tools around?

22:56.350 --> 22:57.479
Thanks.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.059
How are we gonna get out of here?

22:59.060 --> 23:01.139
The electrical lock
on that door is magnetic.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.849
A lot of magnetic locks can be confused

23:03.850 --> 23:06.389
by a strong enough rare-earth magnet.

23:06.390 --> 23:08.219
Luckily for us most people
have one sitting

23:08.220 --> 23:11.639
around their home attached
to their computer's hard drive.

23:15.980 --> 23:17.269
Come on.

23:20.020 --> 23:21.059
Where the hell is everyone?

23:22.180 --> 23:23.809
We can't use the front way out.

23:23.810 --> 23:25.769
Is there another exit?

23:25.770 --> 23:28.059
I think there's a fire escape
on the other end of the office.

23:30.770 --> 23:33.139
Hug the right side of the hall
under the security cameras.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.639
satisfaction, they'll execute
some kind of code.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.679
How is any of this possible?

23:41.680 --> 23:43.219
Someone's spoofed your voice.

23:43.220 --> 23:45.389
It's called concatenative synthesis.

23:45.390 --> 23:48.059
They took hours of your show
and assembled a fake message

23:48.060 --> 23:50.219
to sell the idea that you
wanted to kill yourself.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.099
But who would do that?

23:52.100 --> 23:54.219
The people whose code you discovered.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.219
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:58.850 --> 24:00.452
So the code is real?

24:01.100 --> 24:03.059
It's not a coincidence
that my team quits and then you

24:03.060 --> 24:06.349
just happen to show up as
the perfect replacement, is it?

24:06.350 --> 24:08.269
Is your name even Rose?

24:08.270 --> 24:12.349
Max, you've upset a very powerful being.

24:12.350 --> 24:15.719
We need to stop the Q&A,
and get you off its radar.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.429
Did you say "being"?

24:26.180 --> 24:27.639
How's your hand, Sameen?

24:27.640 --> 24:29.639
Just get on with it.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.410
Have you ever heard of the thylacine?

24:32.640 --> 24:34.979
It's an extinct animal species,

24:34.980 --> 24:36.650
an ecological tragedy.

24:37.430 --> 24:40.099
On the other side
of this door is a woman

24:40.100 --> 24:42.559
who is working to bring
the thylacine back to life.

24:45.270 --> 24:47.479
Her name is Dr. Ayumi Kagawa.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.139
She is an axis,

24:49.140 --> 24:53.651
a point at which humanity's
fortune can swing dramatically.

24:54.100 --> 24:58.219
Tonight, Dr. Kagawa has fully
sequenced the thylacine genome.

24:58.220 --> 25:01.519
In 15 years, she will attempt
to reintroduce this creature

25:01.520 --> 25:04.666
into an ecosystem
that has long since moved on.

25:05.140 --> 25:07.389
Samaritan has the foresight we,

25:07.390 --> 25:09.419
as humans, do not,

25:10.270 --> 25:12.429
and it has seen the dominos fall.

25:12.430 --> 25:15.719
The shifting ecosystem
would affect agriculture,

25:15.720 --> 25:17.979
the food supply, the spread of disease,

25:17.980 --> 25:19.907
and thousands of people will die.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.719
A butterfly flaps its wings.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.117
Are you done yet?

25:26.060 --> 25:29.219
Samaritan has attempted to
sidetrack her work many times,

25:29.220 --> 25:32.683
but she is as tenacious
as she is brilliant,

25:33.520 --> 25:37.019
which leaves us with one option.

25:37.020 --> 25:39.269
If Kagawa is eliminated...

25:46.810 --> 25:47.849
Point made.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.219
Can I wake up now?

26:01.980 --> 26:04.059
Not one victory for the Machine.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.929
Interference? From what?

26:10.930 --> 26:12.479
We're in a Faraday cage.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.809
It's coming from the Samaritan laptop.

26:22.220 --> 26:24.019
Wait. No signal can get in here.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.179
Or out.

26:33.890 --> 26:35.519
Interesting.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.179
Ms. Groves.

26:41.180 --> 26:43.219
How's it going, Harry?

26:43.220 --> 26:44.309
Are you running?

26:44.310 --> 26:46.599
Taking the stairs.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.929
How goes your little simulated showdown?

26:49.930 --> 26:51.219
Having a little trouble with the laptop.

26:51.220 --> 26:53.059
I caught it doing something new.

26:53.060 --> 26:55.519
It's attempting to send out
electromagnetic pulses,

26:55.520 --> 26:57.849
trying to connect with the whole network

26:57.850 --> 27:00.519
of Samaritan-infected devices
around the world:

27:00.520 --> 27:01.809
laptops,

27:01.810 --> 27:03.349
printers, phones.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.719
It's a modified version
of the Funtenna hack.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.139
That's what Samaritan's using.

27:07.140 --> 27:08.479
That's what Max found.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.269
What did Max find?

27:10.270 --> 27:14.059
Electromagnetic pulses cause
buzzing in the AM radio signal.

27:14.060 --> 27:16.019
Buzzing that most people would write off

27:16.020 --> 27:17.599
as harmless interference,

27:17.600 --> 27:19.139
but a trained Samaritan operative...

27:19.140 --> 27:21.349
Would recognize it as hidden code.

27:21.350 --> 27:22.769
Is this about the messages?

27:22.770 --> 27:24.179
Who are you talking to?

27:24.180 --> 27:26.179
Using older technology like radio

27:26.180 --> 27:27.889
would allow Samaritan operatives

27:27.890 --> 27:29.349
to hide in plain sight,

27:29.350 --> 27:31.099
receive secret messages in the field,

27:31.100 --> 27:32.219
or send them to...

27:33.930 --> 27:35.599
Operation centers.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.179
I know why the Machine sent me here.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.679
Wait. Barricade the door.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.099
I'll be back soon as I can.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.309
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

27:51.310 --> 27:53.349
What Machine? What's a Funtenna?

27:55.270 --> 27:57.019
Ms. Groves, I know what you're thinking,

27:57.020 --> 27:58.179
but it's far too dangerous.

27:58.180 --> 27:59.929
Harold, this radio station

27:59.930 --> 28:03.269
can communicate
with any Samaritan facility.

28:03.270 --> 28:06.059
The Machine wants me
to send a message to Shaw.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.559
The Machine wants me
to send a message to Shaw.

28:28.965 --> 28:31.088
Has Ms. Groves
been identified by Samaritan?

28:31.089 --> 28:33.083
_

28:34.205 --> 28:36.874
Has she put Max Greene
in danger of being killed?

28:36.875 --> 28:38.674
_

28:39.875 --> 28:40.914
That's not very helpful.

28:42.005 --> 28:43.964
Yeah, Finch?

28:43.965 --> 28:46.834
I believe Ms. Groves is about to
do something excessively risky.

28:46.835 --> 28:48.414
Color me surprised

28:48.415 --> 28:50.334
'cause I'm almost to
the radio station now.

28:50.335 --> 28:53.164
Samaritan operatives
may already be on the premises.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.374
If you go in there, make sure
you hide your identity.

28:55.375 --> 28:56.544
Don't worry.

28:56.545 --> 28:57.914
They won't see me coming.

29:13.625 --> 29:15.384
Give me a break, Doc.

29:16.545 --> 29:18.754
We're doing another simulation already?

29:18.755 --> 29:21.464
No need. Did you enjoy your field trip?

29:21.465 --> 29:24.574
First real time out of
the facility since you got here.

29:25.545 --> 29:28.254
Real time?

29:28.255 --> 29:29.874
What are you talking about?

29:31.625 --> 29:33.334
Prominent genetic researcher

29:33.335 --> 29:37.414
Dr. Ayumi Kagawa was gunned down
in her lab last night in what

29:37.415 --> 29:41.131
police are calling a random act
of senseless violence.

29:41.132 --> 29:41.785
No.

29:41.786 --> 29:42.964
Her lab was ransacked, destroying...

29:42.965 --> 29:44.874
You're full of it.
That was a simulation.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.334
This is another trick.

29:46.335 --> 29:47.334
That... that...

29:49.755 --> 29:52.704
Or we're still in the simulation now.

29:52.705 --> 29:54.044
How's your hand?

29:59.625 --> 30:01.624
No, no, no.

30:01.625 --> 30:02.914
No, this isn't real.

30:04.205 --> 30:05.564
No.

30:06.045 --> 30:07.964
No! No!

30:08.965 --> 30:10.969
_

30:11.965 --> 30:14.004
It sounds like you don't know
what's real anymore.

30:21.835 --> 30:23.544
The EMF meter.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.834
Okay.

30:32.835 --> 30:34.914
Come on.

30:40.545 --> 30:42.504
The printer.

30:42.505 --> 30:45.656
You've been infected
by Samaritan, haven't you?

30:46.335 --> 30:49.124
Hope you don't mind if I use you
to talk to my friend.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.294
I...

31:01.295 --> 31:02.874
Operatives? How many?

31:04.165 --> 31:05.414
Two.

31:05.415 --> 31:07.004
Is Max safe?

31:18.915 --> 31:20.414
It's okay, Max.

31:21.915 --> 31:24.084
I'm a friend. Come with me.

31:28.795 --> 31:30.874
Oh, so John showed up after all.

31:34.205 --> 31:36.794
That should really kick in.

31:36.795 --> 31:38.704
Couple more minutes now.

31:42.795 --> 31:44.084
Sorry?

31:44.085 --> 31:46.584
There's no safe.

31:53.965 --> 31:56.164
You try anything, I'm gonna
stick this through your eye

31:56.165 --> 31:58.084
all the way into your brain.

31:58.085 --> 32:00.334
You know as well as I do
there's no way to escape.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.544
There's cameras everywhere.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.294
Guards outside this door.

32:03.295 --> 32:06.004
The only way that you get out of
this facility is in a body bag.

32:07.835 --> 32:09.434
Oh, I know,

32:10.665 --> 32:12.374
but I'd rather be dead
than be your guinea pig

32:12.375 --> 32:13.374
for one more day.

32:17.795 --> 32:20.254
Someone get over here!
I need a key card.

32:32.625 --> 32:34.834
Shaw,

32:34.835 --> 32:37.044
please get this.

32:47.505 --> 32:49.044
Four, A.

32:55.045 --> 32:56.584
Four.

32:59.585 --> 33:01.374
Four alarm fire.

33:04.465 --> 33:05.754
Root.

33:17.295 --> 33:18.914
Grab her. Get her arms.

33:21.335 --> 33:22.754
Put your hands up and turn around.

33:25.085 --> 33:27.334
I'll give up without a fight

33:27.335 --> 33:30.084
if you promise to leave Max alone

33:30.085 --> 33:34.164
and take me to the facility
where Sameen Shaw is being held.

33:34.165 --> 33:35.164
Who?

33:36.505 --> 33:38.254
I wasn't talking to you.

33:43.045 --> 33:47.334
I cannot see you, but
I recognize your behavior.

33:47.335 --> 33:49.504
You are an acolyte of the Machine.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.164
Now we're on the same page.

34:07.309 --> 34:08.568
You heard my terms.

34:08.569 --> 34:10.148
Do we have a deal?

34:10.809 --> 34:12.728
If you are willing to surrender,

34:12.728 --> 34:14.518
I will take you to the facility
where Sameen Shaw is being...

34:15.649 --> 34:16.728
What? No!

34:21.859 --> 34:23.728
I almost had her, John!

34:23.728 --> 34:25.808
We need to get out of here now.

34:30.309 --> 34:31.978
Called in a favor.

34:31.978 --> 34:35.068
Dispatch is sending a unit this
way to investigate a break-in.

34:35.069 --> 34:36.688
Now explain to me

34:36.688 --> 34:38.688
what the hell were you thinking

34:38.688 --> 34:40.108
offering yourself up to those guys?

34:40.109 --> 34:42.858
It was my best shot at finding Shaw.

34:42.859 --> 34:44.858
You keep going off
half-cocked like that,

34:44.859 --> 34:46.858
you're gonna get yourself killed.

34:46.859 --> 34:48.308
I'm not Lionel.

34:48.309 --> 34:50.608
I don't need you to protect me.

34:53.438 --> 34:55.308
I got a message to her.

34:57.649 --> 34:59.978
- How do you know?
- The Machine helped me do it.

35:01.939 --> 35:05.068
- I know.
- Where are we going?

35:05.069 --> 35:06.938
We have to get you off the grid.

35:06.939 --> 35:09.516
Talk to someone about getting
you a new ID. Come on.

35:09.517 --> 35:11.204
You're gonna have to live
underground, on the run,

35:11.205 --> 35:12.898
- but at least you'll be...
- On the run?

35:14.769 --> 35:16.398
For how long?

35:16.399 --> 35:17.518
This is nuts.

35:17.519 --> 35:18.898
That's no life.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.518
I'd rather be dead than leave now.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.768
Everything I've talked
about on my show is true.

35:22.769 --> 35:26.808
A nefarious entity
tried to fake my suicide.

35:26.809 --> 35:30.148
The world has changed,
and now I've got proof.

35:35.609 --> 35:37.188
We can't force him to go.

35:38.899 --> 35:41.768
Root, we have to go now.

35:41.769 --> 35:44.518
- I'm not hiding.
- Fine.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.768
You can keep doing your show,

35:46.769 --> 35:51.108
keep subtly hinting that there's
something weird going on,

35:51.109 --> 35:53.544
but you have to lie about tonight.

35:54.309 --> 35:55.728
Lie?

35:55.729 --> 35:56.938
Those people were going to kill you

35:56.939 --> 35:58.768
before you could expose them.

35:58.769 --> 36:00.728
If you never mention the code,

36:00.729 --> 36:03.188
they won't have any reason
to come after you anymore.

36:03.189 --> 36:04.478
Understand?

36:09.229 --> 36:10.576
Fine.

36:11.399 --> 36:12.885
I promise.

36:13.189 --> 36:14.478
I'll lie.

36:30.359 --> 36:33.898
It seems we may temporarily
have matching gaits, Detective.

36:36.729 --> 36:38.314
Wonder Boy send you?

36:39.229 --> 36:40.898
I'm here of my own accord.

36:43.689 --> 36:46.069
You tell Elias
his childhood buddy was dead?

36:46.399 --> 36:48.060
No, not yet.

36:49.399 --> 36:51.268
Yeah, that sounds about right.

36:51.269 --> 36:54.768
Before you go, I need to speak with you.

36:54.769 --> 36:56.268
I'm...

36:56.269 --> 36:59.728
sorry we haven't been
completely forthright.

36:59.729 --> 37:01.207
We...

37:02.939 --> 37:05.308
just didn't want you to get hurt.

37:08.309 --> 37:11.148
I think you need to get
your eyes checked, Glasses.

37:11.149 --> 37:13.205
Where the hell do you think we are, huh?

37:13.899 --> 37:15.926
If you're trying to protect me,
it ain't working.

37:16.689 --> 37:19.358
I got a tunnel full of bodies
that somebody tried to bury.

37:19.359 --> 37:20.898
What is it you guys aren't telling me?

37:22.519 --> 37:25.728
- Please, go back to your job...
- This is my job.

37:28.729 --> 37:30.148
After everything that's happened,

37:30.149 --> 37:32.768
you and John still can't
show me the respect,

37:32.769 --> 37:34.228
of telling me what the hell's going on.

37:34.229 --> 37:35.518
Lionel...

37:35.519 --> 37:36.784
No.

37:37.519 --> 37:38.728
I'm done.

38:14.859 --> 38:16.768
Hello out there.

38:16.769 --> 38:21.978
You're listening to Mysterious
Transmissions on AM 520 WKCP.

38:21.979 --> 38:24.438
This is Max. I don't know
who's still listening,

38:24.439 --> 38:26.938
but let me apologize for the
last couple hours of dead air.

38:26.939 --> 38:31.018
We had some technical
difficulties, to say the least.

38:31.019 --> 38:35.176
I made a promise to someone,
but after some serious thought,

38:35.177 --> 38:37.108
I have to break it.

38:37.109 --> 38:38.108
Max.

38:38.109 --> 38:39.808
A few weeks ago,

38:39.809 --> 38:42.568
I discovered secret messages
hidden in the airwaves.

38:42.569 --> 38:44.398
The static you've been
picking up in our signal?

38:44.399 --> 38:46.438
It's a sophisticated code

38:46.439 --> 38:48.438
belonging to a shadowy organization.

38:48.439 --> 38:50.148
Damn it. I'm going back.

38:50.149 --> 38:52.148
It's too late, John.

38:52.149 --> 38:53.938
Max made his choice.

38:53.939 --> 38:55.728
I'm certain the code
contains instructions

38:55.729 --> 38:57.018
for covert operatives,

38:57.019 --> 39:00.188
but I need your help to prove it.

39:02.454 --> 39:08.944
Because of them, an innocent man
named Warren Franco died.

39:11.533 --> 39:13.032
I'm gonna open up the phones.

39:19.573 --> 39:21.322
You're on with Mysterious Transmissions.

39:21.323 --> 39:24.782
Max, I think your
theory is very interesting.

39:24.783 --> 39:26.242
You're really onto something there,

39:26.243 --> 39:29.242
but I can do you one better.

39:29.243 --> 39:30.532
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

39:30.533 --> 39:32.452
I am 80% sure that I was abducted

39:32.453 --> 39:36.282
by honest-to-goodness
extraterrestrials last night.

39:36.283 --> 39:37.782
See, I was leaving the store when...

39:37.783 --> 39:39.282
I'm sorry to interrupt, my friend.

39:39.283 --> 39:40.952
I would love to hear your story
at another time,

39:40.953 --> 39:43.282
but right now I think
we have more pressing issues,

39:43.283 --> 39:45.322
so let's go to another caller.

39:45.323 --> 39:47.282
You're on with Mysterious Transmissions.

39:47.283 --> 39:48.452
What do you got?

39:48.453 --> 39:50.412
I know what the messages are.

39:50.413 --> 39:51.662
Great, lay it on me.

39:51.663 --> 39:54.162
It's Electronic Voice Phenomena.

39:54.163 --> 39:56.452
I know because that's
how Marie Antoinette

39:56.453 --> 39:58.622
communicates with me all the time,

39:58.623 --> 40:00.992
and apparently
her power increases in the fall.

40:00.993 --> 40:04.282
Max overestimated how much
his listeners care.

40:04.283 --> 40:06.992
It's better if Samaritan
thinks Max is just a kook

40:06.993 --> 40:08.822
no one's gonna believe.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.162
Look, I don't think you guys
understand what we have here.

40:12.203 --> 40:13.242
This is proof...

40:15.993 --> 40:16.992
This is proof...

40:31.914 --> 40:33.914
_

40:38.363 --> 40:40.662
This is 911. What's your emergency?

40:40.663 --> 40:43.421
Hi. Hi, I need help.

40:44.203 --> 40:46.412
I think my coworker
just had a heart attack.

40:51.073 --> 40:54.662
- What happened?
- Samaritan got to the radio host.

40:54.663 --> 40:57.535
The Machine told me
the mission was complete.

40:57.869 --> 40:59.322
You left him alone?

41:03.810 --> 41:05.622
Did you know Max Greene
was going to die?

41:06.969 --> 41:08.912
_

41:08.913 --> 41:10.242
That's not an answer.

41:10.243 --> 41:12.094
_

41:14.033 --> 41:16.492
We never should have trusted
the Machine's word.

41:16.493 --> 41:18.032
Damn thing's been acting strangely

41:18.033 --> 41:19.492
since we put it back together.

41:19.493 --> 41:21.622
She's not acting strangely.

41:21.623 --> 41:24.282
She's doing exactly
what She's programmed to do.

41:24.283 --> 41:26.282
- Ms. Groves...
- The Machine can tell us

41:26.283 --> 41:29.912
where to go, who's in trouble,
but we still have free will.

41:30.990 --> 41:32.912
Max chose to risk his life.

41:32.913 --> 41:35.003
She can't stop him from doing that,

41:35.953 --> 41:38.952
and now Shaw knows
that we haven't given up on her.

41:41.204 --> 41:43.503
I wish we could've saved Max,

41:43.504 --> 41:47.333
but if we were able to give
Shaw some kind of hope?

41:50.164 --> 41:51.293
Maybe it was worth it.

41:51.294 --> 41:53.583
A lie by omission is still a lie.

41:55.084 --> 41:57.253
And using the idea of free will

41:57.254 --> 41:59.502
as an excuse for...

42:00.294 --> 42:01.583
moral attrition?

42:03.584 --> 42:06.333
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with where this is going.

42:42.004 --> 42:45.793
Thank you for helping
me send that message.

42:45.794 --> 42:47.413
I know you're trying
to do the right thing,

42:47.414 --> 42:50.003
even if Harold doesn't see it yet.

42:53.414 --> 42:55.583
Ready for the next mission?

42:59.964 --> 43:01.163
Vasily?

43:01.164 --> 43:04.293
Hi, it's the ballerina.

43:04.294 --> 43:07.043
I didn't think you were going to call.

43:07.044 --> 43:09.253
Let's go on a trip.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.123
I want to see your hometown.

43:11.124 --> 43:13.543
Plateliai? Certainly.

43:13.544 --> 43:15.703
In fact, my father is the administrator

43:15.704 --> 43:17.623
of Zemaitija National Park.

43:17.624 --> 43:18.753
I can take you.

43:18.754 --> 43:20.873
I would like that very much.
