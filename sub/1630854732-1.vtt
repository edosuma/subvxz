WEBVTT

01:36.730 --> 01:38.866
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything alright?

01:38.899 --> 01:40.734
Oh, yes, Mr Dowling.

01:40.768 --> 01:44.405
Um, I'm just taking notes
on your circa-1970s cornicing

01:44.438 --> 01:48.075
and the silver hardware
on your tootalie-wootalie.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.820
Mm-hm.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.460
-Swimmer?
-Swimmer.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.061
-Is she? Yeah!
-Yeah.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.430
She looks like it.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.599
-Shoulders.
-Yes. Classic.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.966
Ohh!

02:13.967 --> 02:15.436
Oh, she was a beautiful dog.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.605
-Oh, yeah.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.207
Oh...

02:19.240 --> 02:21.875
Well, "Storms make trees
take deeper roots."

02:21.909 --> 02:24.111
Oh, it's just a little
Dolly Parton saying

02:24.144 --> 02:25.479
that I find helpful.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.980
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.583
What, so the...
the roots nestle in?

02:29.617 --> 02:30.984
Yeah.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.153
Yeah, like, um, you know...

02:33.187 --> 02:34.988
-And the trunk thickens up?
-Yeah, yeah.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.225
Yeah, I like that.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.894
Ooh, um, uh...

02:40.928 --> 02:44.432
You've got a lovely two-bed,
one-bath, one-car time warp.

02:44.465 --> 02:48.436
-And I have valued it highly.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.171
So you will definitely get your
refinancing for your family.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.407
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm. Look, I've gotta go.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.742
I've just...

02:54.775 --> 02:56.310
I've got a big
office party tonight

02:56.344 --> 02:58.312
and I've gotta get
dolled up and, you know...

02:58.346 --> 03:00.314
But thank you so much
for sharing your life story.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.416
It was
my whole life story.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.684
Yeah, it really was.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.919
-It's cathartic, sharing.
-Yep.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.776
Franny, I'm going to have
to meet you in there.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.378
I've only just finished
my last valuation.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.346
It's dress-up!
You know you've gotta dress up.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.947
I know! Yeah, I know, I know.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.049
-Well, who are you coming as?
-Who do you think?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.185
-Are you OK, Red?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
Well, it's just I can't run!

03:40.254 --> 03:42.055
My fitness is just not up there.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.591
Oh!

04:36.910 --> 04:38.446
Whoops!

05:10.344 --> 05:12.480
Turn around.
Just turn around and leave.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.782
-Hello, Dolly.
-G'day.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.316
Hmm.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.919
Francis?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.491
I'm gonna kill you.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.258
I don't want
to be a joke, Franny.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.895
I want to be taken seriously,
for swear-word's-sake!

05:27.928 --> 05:30.798
I can't get anywhere
when I look ridiculous!

05:30.831 --> 05:32.833
OK, well,
the outfit doesn't help that.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.668
Oh, come on, Red. Loosen up!

05:34.702 --> 05:37.938
Don't tell me to loosen up.
I am loose, I am loose!

05:37.971 --> 05:39.306
I hate you right now.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.975
Well, do you want
to sneak out of here?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.511
Well, I'm not a coward.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.345
OK, so what are we doing?

05:47.280 --> 05:49.116
Come on.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.018
How do you feel?

05:51.051 --> 05:55.088
Well...before you killed me,

05:55.122 --> 05:57.758
I was feeling like a, you know,

05:57.791 --> 06:01.595
frothy, talented,
successful Dolly Parton.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.296
OK, everybody, everybody!

06:03.330 --> 06:05.165
Welcome to the Presley
Property Awards!

06:05.198 --> 06:07.367
And first up,
a very special guest,

06:07.401 --> 06:10.438
the king himself, Elvis!

06:11.872 --> 06:13.441
Alright.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.275
Ooh!

06:55.916 --> 06:57.350
Yes, yes!

07:06.560 --> 07:08.729
The most outstanding
valuer is...

07:08.762 --> 07:09.997
..Lionel!

07:10.030 --> 07:12.566
-Whoo-hoo!

07:13.634 --> 07:14.968
-Sorry, babe.
-Whoo!

07:15.936 --> 07:18.205
Thank you! Thank you!

07:20.774 --> 07:22.610
-I'm gonna get that next year.
-Mm.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.377
And the last
award tonight

07:24.411 --> 07:26.847
is a crowd-pleaser,
a bit of fun.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.716
She's had a wobbly
start to the job,

07:28.749 --> 07:32.119
but I'm excited to announce the
Office Clown Award goes to...

07:32.152 --> 07:34.221
..Raylene 'Red' Delaney.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.189
-I didn't know about this bit.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.526
And tonight
she didn't disappoint.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.528
Whoo, whoo, whoo,
whoo, whoo, whoo!

07:46.600 --> 07:48.068
Hmph.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.204
-Oh, hello!

07:51.238 --> 07:53.807
-Taxi!

07:54.908 --> 07:56.409
Um...

07:56.443 --> 07:59.880
It's my first award ever. Huh!

07:59.913 --> 08:01.949
And I would like to thank my mum

08:01.982 --> 08:03.651
for giving me this clown head.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.636
Well,
there are two kinds of people.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.272
Those who know
how to have a good time...

08:26.473 --> 08:29.509
..and those who are
willin' to learn.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.345
For the second group,
let me introduce myself.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.448
My name is Dolly
and I'm your teacher.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.951
-Yee-ha!

08:39.319 --> 08:44.692
I'd like to invite our
esteemed boss, Forbes Presley,

08:44.725 --> 08:48.295
up onto the dance floor
with his beautiful wife.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.965
-Come on!
-Come on!

08:53.567 --> 08:56.970
I'd like to sing
a little somethin' for ya.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.258
Huh! Kenny Rogers!

10:26.226 --> 10:28.095
He's our most successful client.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.198
We're gearing up
for his Australasia tour.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.433
Twin Palms Theatre,
Hong Kong, etc.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.869
Oh, Twin Palms?
My mum loves that theatre.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.437
It's pretty impressive.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.806
Well, if the show sells out,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.640
we'll go to the USA,
which I'm gunning for.

10:40.674 --> 10:41.975
Are you?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.079
How long you been
performin' Dolly?

10:46.113 --> 10:48.281
Oh, no. Golly, no.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.250
Just mucking around, but, um...

10:50.283 --> 10:52.319
Tonight was just
an unfortunate mistake.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.653
Yeah, right.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.955
Well, it took guts.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.724
-Especially with those people.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.826
It's the bland leading
the bland in there.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.293
No offence.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.604
-I thought you did alright.
-Cheers.

11:11.638 --> 11:14.908
-I'd watch that one.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.145
Kenny's performing at the
Tamworth Country Music Festival.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.148
-You should come. Bring Dolly.
-Oh, no.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.151
You know, only if you liked
being an unfortunate mistake.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.191
Night.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.664
Welcome to my own

11:37.697 --> 11:38.832
little Tennessee cabin.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.468
Come here, baby. Come on.
Come on.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.577
-Come on.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.146
OK.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.319
-Darlin' Dolly.
-Yeah?

11:59.352 --> 12:03.056
-You're a straight-up fantasy.
-Oh! OK.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.663
I gotta be honest
with you, Dolly.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.400
-I hate these orange pants.
-Oh.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.469
Take 'em off,
you'd be close to perfection.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.239
-Yeah, OK.
-Ah! Shh, shh.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.941
As Dolly.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.078
Oh, howdy-doody.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.380
Well, my pants are comin' off.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.352
Bathroom. Back in a sec.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.409
-Raylene!
-Oh!

12:56.443 --> 12:58.611
Not on my beautiful grass!

12:59.579 --> 13:01.048
Ohh!

13:05.252 --> 13:06.786
Who was that?

13:06.820 --> 13:08.788
Elvis Presley.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.258
Oh, it was
that good, was it?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.861
Ma, please stop locking me out.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.196
It's one o'clock
in the morning!

13:16.229 --> 13:18.498
You chose to live
in the garage!

13:19.466 --> 13:21.268
Bloody ridiculous.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.764
There are
two kinds of people.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.035
Those who know how to have
a good time...

13:56.103 --> 14:00.307
..and those who are just trying.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.694
-Mum!

14:21.728 --> 14:23.196
Put your gown on!

14:25.132 --> 14:27.000
Nothing wrong
with being comfortable

14:27.034 --> 14:29.202
in your skin, darling,

14:29.236 --> 14:31.771
au naturel.

14:31.804 --> 14:35.342
I just wish I looked a little
bit more professional.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.812
You are a beautiful
sunburnt mushroom.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.615
Um, thanks, Mum.

14:42.649 --> 14:46.653
It's not what I'm going for,
but...thanks.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.191
Hurry up!

15:01.568 --> 15:04.337
You're late. Hopeless!

15:13.280 --> 15:15.148
I mean, look at her.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.784
All that nylon.
It'll make your snatch sick.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.554
Well, they say natural
perfection isn't everything.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.324
Um, perfection is a bitch.
And do we have to be beautiful?

15:24.357 --> 15:27.027
Because it's not easy
and it's not my preference.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.566
-Could I get a word, Raylene?
-Yes, you may.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.069
I'll just get my...
..cup of ambition.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.440
-So...
-Who do you remind me of?

15:40.473 --> 15:41.908
Scarlett Johansson.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.576
No.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.284
Raylene, I, uh...I have grounds

15:51.318 --> 15:53.553
to fire you
for sexual harassment.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.856
Sorry?

15:56.889 --> 15:58.791
Sexual harassment.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.606
-'Cause I was touching crotches?
-Many.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.577
#MeToo, too many crotches.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.651
I'm sorry. I...I've got this
impulse control problem.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.919
No, it's not just about
last night, Raylene.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.389
Your behaviour
has been inappropriate

16:29.422 --> 16:31.458
prior to last night also.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.826
See, you're not bad at putting
a value on a property.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.462
It's just the whole rest
of the job

16:35.495 --> 16:37.297
that you're a mess.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.599
You know, in business
you need to be

16:39.632 --> 16:43.103
a shiny, professional
house-and-land package

16:43.136 --> 16:44.504
and you're like a, uh...

16:44.537 --> 16:46.739
-Converted garage?
-Yes.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.976
Honestly, you don't really
fit in in any office, Red.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.945
I mean, you're late
every single day.

16:52.979 --> 16:56.449
You lost your driver's licence
when half the job is driving

16:56.483 --> 16:58.951
and you had whisky with that
little old lady at the auction.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.420
But she was so lonely!

17:00.453 --> 17:02.122
She hadn't spoken
to anyone in two weeks!

17:02.155 --> 17:05.125
If you want to stay here,
you need to shut down.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.594
-Shut myself down?
-Mm-hm, yep.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.162
Tuck yourself in.

17:12.899 --> 17:16.002
OK, it's too much copper,
which is why we're red

17:16.035 --> 17:18.371
and why we hardly charge
and why we bleed lots.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.006
It's like bed them
or bury them alive

17:20.039 --> 17:21.108
is what the ancient Egyptians...

17:21.141 --> 17:22.709
I don't care about
your hair, Red.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.244
Please, Forbes.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.614
I can fit in.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.383
And I can tuck in.
I can tuck right in.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.385
And I'd never bring up
the size of your cock.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.886
You're fired.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.522
You're like the love child
of Mick Hucknall

17:35.555 --> 17:37.390
and Ronald McDonald
if they banged.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.892
-I quit!
-Excuse me?

17:39.926 --> 17:42.229
This is a circus
and you're the freak!

17:42.262 --> 17:44.197
You can't fire me
because I quit!

17:44.231 --> 17:46.399
-Oh!
-Shi... Oh!

17:46.433 --> 17:48.201
-Oooh!

17:48.235 --> 17:49.569
Ohh!

17:51.070 --> 17:52.839
Tuck that shit in!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.820
-I love you!

19:47.854 --> 19:50.590
Come back to my room.
I love you!

19:56.296 --> 19:57.730
Thanks a lot.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.501
And this one.
This one's for Trudy.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.037
-And this one too!

20:08.875 --> 20:10.610
Dolly. Where do I start?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.979
I mean she's old-school,
but she's new-school relevant.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.348
-Mm.
-She's funny and successful.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.216
And smart and talented.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.219
But she's heart-breaking
and she's a poet,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.054
but she knows who she is,
you know?

20:22.088 --> 20:24.657
She's just like that
little bit of hope

20:24.691 --> 20:27.494
holding up humanity
or at least my humanity.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.697
Why are you 'Teeth'?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.299
-Real name's Annie.
-Oh.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.033
But I got my nickname

20:34.066 --> 20:36.336
'cause I had a sack of teeth
growing in my ovaries.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.707
Every time.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.310
-What?!

20:43.343 --> 20:46.479
Hey, we're casting for
a new Dolly at the moment

20:46.513 --> 20:50.817
for Kenny's show to boost
his image and ticket sales

20:50.850 --> 20:54.721
and I'm submittin' you
as my number one.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.088
What?

20:56.122 --> 20:57.657
There's a Dolly stand-up gig
on tonight.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.726
-Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Yeah. Come on.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.328
-Oh.
-It's gonna be a tough crowd.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.962
Let's see what you're made of.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.173
Oh, wow. Alright.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.409
Yeah,
make-up's a little extra.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.778
Thanks, Tay-Tay,
you squeaky mouse.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.747
You said do my best. Best.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.715
Oh, no. Oh, no!

21:22.749 --> 21:24.717
-Is it too much? Is it too much?
-No, look.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.218
It's...it's...it's fine.

21:26.252 --> 21:29.088
It's...it's fine.
We don't have time.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.023
Plus, Kenny's here.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.792
Don't worry.
You don't have to sing.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.461
Just, um, banter.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.529
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.531
-I feel carsick.
-No, listen. Come on.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.266
Remember,
it's about the audience

21:40.299 --> 21:41.968
and their nostalgia, right?

21:42.001 --> 21:44.537
It is more about them
and less about you.

21:44.571 --> 21:45.605
-OK.
-Yeah?

21:45.638 --> 21:46.906
Like you did
at that office party.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.375
Unless you wanna go back
to a boring nine-to-five.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.609
I really don't, I really don't.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.910
No, 'cause you'd neck
yourself, mate.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.979
-And I'd probably help you.
-Thank you.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.246
-Now...
-Thanks.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.615
..let me look at you.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.419
Well, mate,
you're a bit of a hot mess.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.388
But the time is now.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.290
-OK.
-Pony up. You can do it.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.125
That a girl.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.080
Welcome, Dolly!

22:29.782 --> 22:31.217
Best of luck.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.687
Howdy.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.657
I've gotta be honest.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.325
This is my first time
properly.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.793
We'll be gentle!

22:40.827 --> 22:42.495
-Howdy, darling!

22:43.830 --> 22:45.331
Well, look at you all!

22:45.364 --> 22:46.599
Thanks, Doll.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.501
We'd rather be looked at
than overlooked!

22:59.011 --> 23:00.680
Well, I really...

23:00.713 --> 23:04.050
..I really patterned my look
from a serious place,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.152
from a country girl's idea
of glamour

23:06.185 --> 23:08.521
after what they called
the "town tramp".

23:11.357 --> 23:13.025
In a country town,
a mountain town,

23:13.059 --> 23:14.961
there's always
a few loose women.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.729
That's me!

23:16.763 --> 23:19.699
And she had this beautiful
peroxide hair

23:19.732 --> 23:22.702
piled on her head,
red nails, high-heel shoes

23:22.735 --> 23:25.404
and I just thought she was the
prettiest thing I've ever seen.

23:27.039 --> 23:30.042
But my momma, she said,
"She ain't nothin' but trash."

23:30.076 --> 23:32.712
And I thought, "That's what
I wanna be, Momma.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.013
"I want to be trash!"

23:36.783 --> 23:38.518
Opinionated mommas,
we've all got 'em,

23:38.551 --> 23:39.919
burnin' in our ears.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.255
But thank you so much
for listening, boys.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.824
One piece of advice.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.894
Always act like it's rainin'
and wear your rubbers!

23:53.299 --> 23:54.667
Thank you and goodnight!

23:57.103 --> 23:58.671
-Doll.
-Hey!

23:58.705 --> 24:02.008
I may look like a man,
but inside I'm a lady.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.612
-Whoo-hoo!

24:05.645 --> 24:07.614
Hey, you did pretty good!

24:07.647 --> 24:09.448
Hey, who's that guy with Kenny?

24:09.482 --> 24:11.017
He looks like Neil Diamond.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.919
That's my boss,
Wilson Stone.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.621
He runs Genuine Copy Management.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.589
-I didn't want to freak you out.
-I freaked anyway.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.390
-I mean, I freaked!
-No, but you were fine.

24:18.424 --> 24:19.726
I've gotta get Kenny
to the hotel.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.227
-But make sure you call me.
-I will.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.595
-You did well.
-Thanks.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.230
I need a drink.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.099
Hey, Franny,
I'm staying at this motel

24:27.133 --> 24:29.368
with this huge golden guitar...

24:29.401 --> 24:30.770
-Hey!
-Thank you, Dolly.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.238
..this huge golden guitar
out the front

24:32.271 --> 24:33.773
and I just performed as Dolly,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.307
but I didn't touch any crotches.

24:35.341 --> 24:38.611
And I've got this new friend
who grew teeth in her ovaries.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.313
OK. See you. Bye.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.533
Come in.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.605
Buddy!

25:05.638 --> 25:08.575
You get fired from work,
you're five hours out of town

25:08.608 --> 25:10.677
with a woman with teeth
in her vagina?

25:10.710 --> 25:13.580
Call me crazy, but terror
ran through my brain.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.615
You're a silly,
billy, willy, villy.

25:15.648 --> 25:18.517
Get up.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.252
Help me.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.688
Yep, yep.
That's good, that's good.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.489
Come on, Red.
Get in the shower.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.858
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Oh, my feet!

25:27.126 --> 25:29.929
This drag queen had
the prettiest boob job.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.631
-Do not get bolt-ons!
-I'm just saying...

25:31.664 --> 25:33.733
I'm just saying,
what a professional.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.606
I smell
Sunday roast chicken!

25:39.639 --> 25:41.674
It's hormone-free!

25:42.642 --> 25:44.210
Can't have my men
growing breasts.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.645
-Red, hi.
-Hey, Gramps.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.113
-Mwah!
-Darlin'.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.648
Ooh! Bathroom.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.450
Where have you been?

25:51.483 --> 25:54.553
Francis's couch.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.723
Just 'cause you're old enough
doesn't mean that I've...

25:56.756 --> 25:58.658
..stopped being
your mum.

25:58.691 --> 26:02.161
Oh, Franny, did you win
that award, darling?

26:02.194 --> 26:03.696
-I forgot to ask.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.531
-Nope.
-Maybe next year.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.067
Or Red might even get the award.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.902
-I will.
-You got fired.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.839
You got fired?

26:12.872 --> 26:15.341
-Again?
-I didn't. Mum, calm down.

26:15.374 --> 26:18.711
Well, it's not exactly
soothing information.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.013
It's nothing.
It's just a career glitch.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.850
Oh, sorry, Red quit.
She quit.

26:23.883 --> 26:26.653
You got fired and quit,
but in the same day?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.320
Well, that's new.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.824
You know, in all my career,
I have never lost a job.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.360
I've always been
a high achiever.

26:34.393 --> 26:38.765
I've had rounds of IVF
and then being a single mum,

26:38.798 --> 26:41.400
very creative.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.603
I've managed to have my cake,
decorate it and eat it,

26:44.637 --> 26:46.072
so to speak, hm?

26:46.105 --> 26:49.541
I just boggle at...you.

26:49.575 --> 26:54.413
I know! You can work with me
at the Royal Blind Society.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.784
You could move back in here,
we can rent out the garage...

26:57.817 --> 26:59.786
Mum, I'm not
moving back in here.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.354
-I'm perfectly capable myself.
-Are you?

27:02.388 --> 27:05.157
'Cause I'd say it's been
quite the journey so far.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.094
What are you going to do?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.598
Well, I'll tell you.
She is going...

27:12.631 --> 27:13.966
Mm!

27:15.334 --> 27:18.237
She's gonna tell you
that Franny and I are dating.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.940
See? Partner, Mum.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.942
-Ticked that box.
-Oh! Oh!

27:22.975 --> 27:24.210
That's the news to focus on.

27:24.243 --> 27:27.213
Ohh, my darlings!

27:27.246 --> 27:28.781
I know!

27:28.815 --> 27:30.717
Ha ha ha!

27:30.750 --> 27:32.418
Ohh!

27:36.355 --> 27:37.957
Where are you going?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.826
Obviously to yours.

27:39.859 --> 27:43.062
I just need a frickin' minute,
just a minute,

27:43.095 --> 27:45.331
to work out me
and my career thing

27:45.364 --> 27:47.133
without everyone's 50 cents.

27:49.035 --> 27:53.005
So Dolly...
is moving in with you.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.744
-Ooh!
-Ohh.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.446
She's brash,
she's bubbly,

28:00.479 --> 28:01.981
real forward.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.650
Nipples to the sky.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.319
And be confident!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.163
Three bras does the trick.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.698
Hello, Kenny.
My name is Dolly.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.535
Kenny, you're so hot.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.137
I will always love you.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.940
Oh, man,
she's hard. Dolly's so hard.

28:27.974 --> 28:31.143
I will love you too
if you keep your ass so tight.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.113
Should have gone with
Britney Spears or something.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.849
Ooh! Cool Bowie!

28:41.020 --> 28:43.522
The Teeth is taking me
to this secret club

28:43.555 --> 28:45.792
and hopefully I'll win over
her boss somehow

28:45.825 --> 28:47.994
and he'll take me on
as Kenny's Dolly.

28:48.027 --> 28:51.163
OK, so just a reminder that
your track record with bosses

28:51.197 --> 28:53.532
or any authority ever
is not great.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.068
So try and be a bit more Dolly

28:56.102 --> 28:57.970
and less Red when negotiating

28:58.004 --> 28:59.906
or even charming him

28:59.939 --> 29:01.707
'cause you're gonna
need cash to pay off

29:01.740 --> 29:03.409
the credit debt
you just cranked up.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.512
Yeah, well, big stars of
the copy world make good coin.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.181
This isn't a game to me.
This is business.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.384
Franny, can you help me?

29:12.418 --> 29:14.220
I can't do anything
with these nails.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.922
Oh, just...

29:17.689 --> 29:19.325
Yeah.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.060
Here.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.362
My name is Dolly.
Ain't you cute?

29:23.395 --> 29:25.097
-Ain't you sweet? Ain't you...
-Is this right?

29:25.131 --> 29:27.099
Yeah. Can you do it up?

29:28.467 --> 29:30.269
Hurry, Franny. Come on.
I'm running late.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.239
-And I got it.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.842
OK. How do I look?

29:35.875 --> 29:38.978
Ain't you a squeezy bag
of peaches?

29:40.412 --> 29:41.547
OK.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.884
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.618
I'll have
to knock that out of you

30:19.651 --> 30:21.553
'cause my time is no less
valuable than yours, alright?

30:21.587 --> 30:23.122
And ease up on the 'sorry's.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.291
Dolly would do one tough 'sorry'
and that's it.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.293
Sorry.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.229
Cool.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.231
-Ready to be Dolly?
-Yeah.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.068
-That wig is so much better.
-Thanks.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.971
You get one shot with Wilson,
so don't mess it up, OK?

30:40.139 --> 30:41.908
It's cocktail hour

30:41.941 --> 30:45.644
with the one and only
Miss Ton Vee!

31:12.471 --> 31:15.007
I told you I've got
a Streisand back in the States.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.508
I don't need another, darling.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.877
Sorry to interrupt.
Dolly, this is Wilson.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.613
Wilson, Dolly performed
in Tamworth, remember?

31:21.647 --> 31:23.382
In...in drag.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.887
Take me back to Vegas
with you, Neil Diamond.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.390
Mwah!

31:32.524 --> 31:34.994
Always with the kiss.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.734
Two, two.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.554
'I Will Always Love You'.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.457
Really?

32:06.892 --> 32:08.860
Good move not selling
that song to Elvis

32:08.894 --> 32:11.363
and making a packet
with Whitney Houston.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.211
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:25.244 --> 32:26.945
keep that applause going

32:26.979 --> 32:29.215
for your favourite
master of ceremonies,

32:29.248 --> 32:32.351
the one, the only, Elvis!

32:36.989 --> 32:38.457
-Come here, baby.
-Mmm!

32:38.490 --> 32:39.925
Come on.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.260
-Oh!

32:42.661 --> 32:46.465
Isn't she a sweetie?
Miss Ton Vee!

32:46.498 --> 32:49.035
Could I have another round
of applause for her, please?

32:52.004 --> 32:55.874
Oh, hello, Norma Jean.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.543
-Oh!
-Later?

32:57.576 --> 32:59.878
We've got a fabulous show
for you here tonight.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.880
We're gonna be following up
with Lady Gaga...

33:05.184 --> 33:06.652
..and Miss Amy Winehouse,

33:06.685 --> 33:08.387
so please hang onto
your drinks, your wares.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.588
I'll be right back.

33:09.621 --> 33:10.956
We're gonna have
a great time tonight.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.324
Going to the ladies.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.005
Hey, Wilson!
How's it goin'?

34:09.915 --> 34:12.584
-Shit!
-You sound amazing.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.322
-I was trying...
-I'm a woman, not a drag act.

34:16.355 --> 34:19.525
Good for you. I'll tell Kenny.
He was wondering.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.161
I want to make a living
doing this.

34:22.194 --> 34:25.063
You and every other
tribute performer.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.998
Doesn't mean it's a good idea.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.703
Give me a chance.

34:31.737 --> 34:35.040
Whatever happened to
a good old-fashioned chance?

34:35.073 --> 34:37.509
They got phased out in the '80s.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.047
I have genuine copies,

34:42.080 --> 34:44.350
not copies of copies.

34:45.951 --> 34:49.087
Do you breathe, sleep
and eat Dolly?

34:49.121 --> 34:50.556
It's hard work, OK,

34:50.589 --> 34:54.426
from every small, demeaning gig
to the biggest venues.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.229
And you strike me as someone

34:57.263 --> 34:59.965
who doesn't
stick to things, right?

35:01.900 --> 35:03.802
Yeah. I thought so.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.873
This is where I belong.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.508
I feel at home here.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.844
This is what
I'm supposed to be doing!

35:12.878 --> 35:15.914
I mean, I've idolised Dolly
since I was a kid.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.251
Please, Wilson.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.886
-Man, please!
-Hey!

35:22.154 --> 35:23.522
Dolly don't beg.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.557
No begging. Sorry.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.092
No sorrys.

35:28.059 --> 35:29.995
No sorrys, no beggin'.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.135
I would've been tall if I didn't
get bunched up at the top.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.658
Poof! Poof!

35:59.691 --> 36:01.960
Hmph.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.496
Yeah, you're weird enough.
I'll give you that.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.932
We need more Dollys
in the world.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.941
Listen to me.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.610
I've got someone else in mind
for Kenny's tour.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.045
But...

36:21.012 --> 36:22.748
..I like the '80s

36:22.781 --> 36:24.416
so I'm gonna throw you a bone.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.254
Show me what you're made of.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.795
Hey, I grabbed
your favourite power juice.

36:38.163 --> 36:41.099
Did I tell you I saw Katy Perry
making out with Katy Perry?

36:41.132 --> 36:42.768
Well, I want to see the Katys!

36:42.801 --> 36:44.936
Not until I'm a pro
and not at the club

36:44.970 --> 36:46.605
'cause you're not a copy
or a manager

36:46.638 --> 36:48.507
or a celebrity.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.476
Yeah, you wouldn't fit in.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.512
These people are
so wonderfully unique.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.315
Can you try and keep Dolly

36:56.348 --> 36:58.284
tucked in to just one corner
of the house?

36:58.317 --> 37:00.386
-Don't wait up!

37:00.419 --> 37:01.987
-You're welcome.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.658
So you just
stick to the script, yeah,

37:06.692 --> 37:08.126
honouring the incredible work

37:08.159 --> 37:09.661
of iconic Australian actor
Jack Thompson.

37:09.695 --> 37:10.896
Then you sing your Jack song.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.230
-And then you're off.
-Yeah.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.866
George, the Minogue sisters
are stuck together.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.469
Hang on, Dannii!

37:17.503 --> 37:20.205
If I pull down and you pull
sideways, it might work.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.341
Kylie and Dannii
were supposed to do a spot

37:22.374 --> 37:24.376
with Elvis and introduce Dolly.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.977
Dolly, you buffer with Elvis.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.479
Remember,
banter is your forte.

37:27.513 --> 37:30.081
No, no, I can't do that.
I can't improvise.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.983
-Yes, you can.
-I have to prepare.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.353
-Let's go.
-What's...

37:34.386 --> 37:36.655
You two,
I'm gonna push you out.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.857
There's gonna be a lot of
people coming through here.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.228
Thank you very much.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.263
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you very much.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.733
Who's wearing a wig now?
Who's wearing a wig?

37:50.035 --> 37:52.203
Oh, Madonna, darlin',
you look so pretty there.

37:52.237 --> 37:55.273
I'm just not so sure
about your hair.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.676
You take it down,
you'd be close to perfect.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.011
May I come down there
and give you a kiss, ma'am?

38:00.045 --> 38:01.246
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.616
Improvise, Dolly.
You've got this. You...

38:04.650 --> 38:06.718
Damn straight I do.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.460
-Why, howdy, Elvis!

38:14.493 --> 38:16.027
Ladies and gents,

38:16.061 --> 38:17.596
dollars and cents.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.264
Hello, Dolly.
Look at you.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.700
Please do. I'd rather be
looked at than overlooked.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.369
-Mm-mm!

38:24.803 --> 38:26.572
Madonna, don't listen to Elvis.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.974
I don't like to be
like everybody else.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.076
That's the easiest thing
in the world to do.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.378
Love you, Dolly!

38:32.411 --> 38:33.779
But you ain't

38:33.812 --> 38:35.747
the real deal now,
are you, Dolly?

38:35.781 --> 38:38.149
Nothin' real about me,
but my heart.

38:38.183 --> 38:41.487
I've seen you perform.
I ain't so sure.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.322
I've seen you perform too,
Elvis.

38:44.356 --> 38:47.493
-That's right.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.295
All men come back for an encore
and a standin' ovation,

38:50.328 --> 38:52.330
but you weren't even standin'.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.666
Oh, thank you very much, Dolly.
Thanks very much about that.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.602
Miss Dolly Parton here.
Thank you very much.

38:56.635 --> 38:59.405
Has he left the buildin' yet?
I'm just kiddin'.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.507
Isn't he a sweetie,
ladies and gentlemen?

39:01.540 --> 39:03.942
Now, we've got a very special
guest here tonight

39:03.975 --> 39:07.312
and I've got a little song
for my friend Jack.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.935
Alright, the guest spot
in Kenny's show,

39:29.968 --> 39:33.505
starting with five appearances
at the Orchard Oriental.

39:33.539 --> 39:35.541
My cut is 35%.

39:35.574 --> 39:36.775
-20.
-30.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.176
Done, with a cut of the merch.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.778
We don't have merch.
But you know what?

39:39.811 --> 39:41.012
Actually,
that's a very good idea.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.015
-Hm.
-OK. What do you think?

39:44.049 --> 39:46.618
Dolly says,
"You'll never do a whole lot

39:46.652 --> 39:48.654
"unless you're brave enough
to try."

39:48.687 --> 39:51.457
Alright, Dolly. Pack your bags.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.859
Sunday, you're going
to Hong Kong, baby.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.226
Yes!

39:59.565 --> 40:01.066
-Hmm...
-Watch the bar.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.668
-Watch the bar!

40:03.902 --> 40:06.705
Are you gonna come out of the
closet to Viv before you fly?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.574
Franny, don't take the piss.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.175
I'm nervous enough as it is.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.043
Come on. This is one bed,
one bath.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.979
I am busting my arse right now!

40:14.012 --> 40:15.581
Old self is gone.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.516
I've torn down the fibro,
chucked out the asbestos

40:17.549 --> 40:19.485
and the new brick has gone up.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.086
I'm a better house

40:21.119 --> 40:23.421
not ready to be
appraised just yet.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.323
Hong Kong is a big deal!

40:25.356 --> 40:27.192
They're gonna start
paying me well.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.327
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!
It's a professional job.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.797
You can stop covering up.
Viv will be proud.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.267
Do you think she might
be mildly proud?

40:37.235 --> 40:39.237
It's a great Mother's Day gift.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.572
Mm.

40:41.707 --> 40:44.109
She does love her garden
more than she loves me.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.011
That could be true.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.579
Yeah.

40:47.613 --> 40:50.482
-Ooh...!
-Oh, Franny, don't.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.962
Well, I've got some news.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.765
Oh, here we go. Brace for it.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.300
-I've got some news too.
-Oh.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.269
-But you go first. Go on.
-OK.

41:11.302 --> 41:15.473
I sold one of my macrame
thingies to a lady at work!

41:15.507 --> 41:17.475
Congrats, Ma.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.444
Is she blind?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.513
Well...yes.

41:22.514 --> 41:25.116
And I've started online dating.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.918
-Whoa.
-Mm!

41:26.952 --> 41:28.654
It must be two decades since...

41:28.687 --> 41:30.956
-OK, Dad! Thanks.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.991
Yes, I'm pretty
proud of myself.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.726
Very modern of me.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.663
Well, my news, also modern.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.666
-Job.
-Oh! Fabulous!

41:40.699 --> 41:42.500
Oh, I couldn't bear
another embarrassing

41:42.534 --> 41:44.536
career song and dance.

41:48.607 --> 41:50.842
I'm a Dolly Parton impersonator.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.186
Oh!

42:02.320 --> 42:05.624
OK, I mean, we all know
how much you love her,

42:05.657 --> 42:08.026
but people are gonna pay
to see you do that, are they?

42:08.059 --> 42:09.494
-Yes!

42:09.527 --> 42:11.663
As much as people pay
for your cock and ball thingos.

42:12.664 --> 42:16.367
I manage to be normal,
thank you, darling,

42:16.401 --> 42:20.205
while you're off on some
wild, sequinned goose chase

42:20.238 --> 42:22.207
that isn't gonna end well.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.976
They're flying me to Hong Kong
tonight for a gig

42:25.010 --> 42:27.979
with the world's best
Kenny Rogers impersonator.

42:28.013 --> 42:30.716
And we're performing
at this really posh hotel

42:30.749 --> 42:32.383
for a whole week!

42:32.417 --> 42:35.186
Much to your surprise, Mum,
I'm not an idiot

42:35.220 --> 42:37.388
and it will end well
if it kills me.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.224
Dolly or dead!

42:41.526 --> 42:44.029
So...end of discussion.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.860
You're enough.

43:14.893 --> 43:16.928
This will probably
be your last job

43:16.962 --> 43:18.864
and you'll never work again.

43:18.897 --> 43:20.331
You're enough.

43:20.365 --> 43:21.933
You're gonna be fine.

43:21.967 --> 43:25.270
-I'm farting too, constantly.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.605
-Must be the plane food.
-What?

43:27.639 --> 43:30.075
-I said, "Starting!"
-Oh, golly, gotta...gotta go.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.077
I wish we had more time
to prepare.

44:05.677 --> 44:07.245
Now, I gotta tell you, folks,

44:07.278 --> 44:11.750
this next song is one
of my all-time favourites.

44:11.783 --> 44:13.384
He might be singing it
by himself.

44:13.418 --> 44:15.153
-I know. Jesus!
-I promised you a surprise.

44:17.622 --> 44:20.591
Oh, no, no, no.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.894
I'm such an idiot.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.336
Far out.

44:35.173 --> 44:37.175
-There she is! That's...
-Did I miss it?

44:37.208 --> 44:38.777
-What happened?
-Oh, my God.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.178
-It's fine.
-It's not fine!

44:40.211 --> 44:41.579
It's not.
Where are your other wigs?

44:41.612 --> 44:43.314
-In my dressing room.
-We don't have time...

44:43.348 --> 44:45.016
-Go. Go!
-It's fine, it's fine.

44:45.050 --> 44:46.752
-I'm going on.
-It's not fine. You look crazy.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.653
-Just get it together, OK?
-OK. Yeah.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.956
And remember to hold his hand.
Be Dolly!

45:13.378 --> 45:15.046
Smile and get it together.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.815
This sexy man
makes a girl speechless!

45:34.599 --> 45:36.067
A stream is a small
body of water.

45:36.101 --> 45:37.235
Yeah, I know, but it's fine.

45:37.268 --> 45:38.970
There's no way an island
fits in a stream.

45:39.004 --> 45:40.071
I know.

45:57.055 --> 45:59.757
Thank you very much. You have
been a wonderful audience.

45:59.791 --> 46:01.326
Thank you very much!

46:03.962 --> 46:07.698
And thank you to the divine
Dolly Parton.

46:07.732 --> 46:10.168
Well, thank you
for havin' me, Kenny.

46:16.241 --> 46:18.743
Shall we sing it one more time?
What do you say, folks?

46:18.776 --> 46:20.846
-Let's sing it one more time.

46:20.879 --> 46:23.414
Hey, Dolly, my little star,
get...get back up here!

46:23.448 --> 46:26.017
-Come on!
-Enunciate!

46:27.718 --> 46:28.887
Oh, my God.

46:50.108 --> 46:54.112
I'm landin', covered in
make-up, glitter on my face.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.313
Glitter?

46:55.346 --> 46:57.048
And I hear...

47:00.251 --> 47:02.387
In walks Wilson

47:02.420 --> 47:05.323
and Mr Kenny Rogers himself

47:05.356 --> 47:07.959
and he says,

47:07.993 --> 47:10.595
"You do me better than I do me."

47:10.628 --> 47:12.630
Oh, I love that.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.265
I love that!

47:14.299 --> 47:18.303
Then he goes, "World's best.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.605
"You keep the dream alive, boy."

47:20.638 --> 47:22.540
Ohh!

47:25.977 --> 47:27.445
-Mmm.
-Mm-hm.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.948
Oh, his...

47:29.981 --> 47:33.484
..his music touched me deeply
when I was growin' up.

47:33.518 --> 47:34.752
Mm-hm.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.854
And I look like him.

47:36.888 --> 47:39.624
-And he chose me.
-Mm-hm.

47:39.657 --> 47:43.128
It's been my clear calling
all of my life.

47:44.129 --> 47:47.298
Well, now he's gone,
it's...it's just me.

47:47.332 --> 47:48.900
And, uh...

47:51.369 --> 47:53.038
Dolly.

47:56.407 --> 47:58.876
-Oh, Dolly.

47:58.910 --> 48:00.611
Oh, Kenny.

48:06.084 --> 48:08.286
-Get up. Get up.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.554
Oh!

48:13.391 --> 48:15.226
-Oh, Kenny...
-Oh!

48:15.260 --> 48:16.827
Oh, Kenny!

48:17.762 --> 48:19.364
Oh, Kenny!

48:20.665 --> 48:22.333
-Oh!
-Oh, Dolly.

48:22.367 --> 48:23.734
-Oh, Dolly.

48:23.768 --> 48:25.336
-Oh, Dolly!

48:25.370 --> 48:27.538
-OH, DOLLY!
-OH, KENNY!

48:36.214 --> 48:37.582
Hm...

48:44.189 --> 48:45.590
Hmm.

49:02.373 --> 49:05.943
-I've got 'pwesents'!
-Hey.

49:05.977 --> 49:07.712
I'm so sorry
I didn't call, Franwa.

49:07.745 --> 49:10.915
It's just Hong Kong was just
full-on, but it was amazing.

49:22.160 --> 49:25.863
This Kenny Rogers impersonator
is such a professional.

49:25.896 --> 49:28.466
-What's his name?
-Um...

49:28.499 --> 49:31.036
..coincidentally, it's Kenny.

49:31.069 --> 49:33.271
His name is Kenny?

49:37.108 --> 49:38.609
Did you two get it on?

49:41.512 --> 49:44.415
-Mmm.
-Good for you, mate!

49:44.449 --> 49:47.152
At least one of us
is getting laid.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.287
Bring him to Sunday roast
so we can all judge him.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.389
-Hmm.
-I'm kidding.

49:51.422 --> 49:52.990
Let's not jump ahead, Franny.

49:53.024 --> 49:54.992
But he does bring out
the best in me.

49:57.362 --> 49:59.797
If I were an impersonator,
I'd want to be...

49:59.830 --> 50:01.332
Who would you be?

50:02.367 --> 50:05.236
-Mm?
-I'd be you.

50:05.270 --> 50:07.004
As if you could be me.

50:07.038 --> 50:08.339
Because I blink a lot

50:08.373 --> 50:10.075
because it's really intense
living my life

50:10.108 --> 50:11.742
because I've got
really full-on hair

50:11.776 --> 50:13.344
and it's really full-on
and hard,

50:13.378 --> 50:14.845
but some people just fly
to Hong Kong

50:14.879 --> 50:16.781
and then you just become
the most perfect Dolly,

50:16.814 --> 50:18.183
the perfect Dolly.

50:20.551 --> 50:22.687
I'm actually making
a career out of this.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.456
Yeah, I know,
but you can't just be

50:25.490 --> 50:27.692
a cardboard cut-out
of an impersonator.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.127
I'm not.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.928
I'm just saying you've
gotta bring more to it

50:30.961 --> 50:33.798
than a blonde wig
and a bra full of socks, right?

50:33.831 --> 50:35.700
Creatively,

50:35.733 --> 50:37.502
emotionally, socially.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.137
I am bringing more!

50:50.748 --> 50:52.483
It's fibro walls.

50:52.517 --> 50:55.220
You should, um,
start looking at rentals.

50:58.923 --> 51:01.058
Also, have you spoken
to your mum yet?

51:01.092 --> 51:05.996
I'm wondering if I should
"break up" with you or what?

51:06.030 --> 51:08.866
-Um, yeah. Um...

51:08.899 --> 51:12.837
Tell her that I broke up
with you because I couldn't...

51:12.870 --> 51:14.372
-..commit.
-Open up?

51:14.405 --> 51:16.040
Yeah, great. Perfect.

51:37.628 --> 51:39.564
It's an investment
for my career,

51:39.597 --> 51:40.931
so as I was saying,

51:40.965 --> 51:43.334
I just, uh...I don't
want to be so flat.

51:43.368 --> 51:46.103
You know, I want to have shape,
you know, big'uns.

51:46.137 --> 51:49.106
Take a seat. Doreen, is it?

51:50.074 --> 51:52.610
Uh, it's actually Raylene.

51:52.643 --> 51:55.580
This is the size
I am willing to do for you.

51:55.613 --> 51:58.316
They will be beautiful.

51:59.650 --> 52:02.220
The size you're asking for
you'd have to work up to

52:02.253 --> 52:06.056
with multiple surgeries over
an extensive lifetime career.

52:06.090 --> 52:07.192
Oh.

52:07.225 --> 52:08.793
If you decide to go
under the knife,

52:08.826 --> 52:11.462
do you want them under
the breast muscle or over?

52:11.496 --> 52:13.063
Let me think.

52:13.097 --> 52:14.765
What did Dolly do?

52:16.100 --> 52:19.069
-Jolene?
-Um, yeah? Oh, sorry, yes.

52:19.103 --> 52:21.439
Um, under the breast muscle.

52:26.311 --> 52:28.613
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

52:28.646 --> 52:30.581
for the Copy Club's hottest duo,

52:30.615 --> 52:32.783
Kenny and Dolly!

52:40.491 --> 52:42.660
Yee-ha!

53:43.821 --> 53:46.056
OK, Kenny,
if you could step out now.

53:46.090 --> 53:48.493
-Alright, baby. Over to you.
-OK!

53:57.067 --> 53:59.036
Get over here!

53:59.069 --> 54:01.672
Kenny,
I cannot believe this house!

54:01.706 --> 54:04.008
We smash the rest
of this tour, baby,

54:04.041 --> 54:06.010
Nashville will be calling.

54:06.944 --> 54:08.746
Mmm.

54:08.779 --> 54:10.047
So...

54:11.282 --> 54:12.883
..your real name.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.752
You're coming undone here.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.253
-Oh, golly.
-Here.

54:16.287 --> 54:17.922
No, you're right, you're right.

54:21.459 --> 54:23.060
Kenny, Dolly.

54:23.093 --> 54:27.532
I'm...I'm Kenny Rogers,
officially deed polled and all.

54:27.565 --> 54:30.167
You prefer Dolly, I assume?

54:30.200 --> 54:32.737
Like you have no idea.

54:35.139 --> 54:37.107
People think that I'm weird,

54:37.141 --> 54:39.910
that my behaviour
is inappropriate or whatever,

54:39.944 --> 54:43.848
but being a mimic is not enough.

54:43.881 --> 54:46.717
It doesn't matter who you are
or what industry you're in.

54:46.751 --> 54:49.286
You cannot be halfway in.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.556
Yeah, you've gotta
bring everythin'.

54:51.589 --> 54:54.792
Emotionally,
creatively, socially.

54:54.825 --> 54:56.160
I get it.

54:57.962 --> 55:00.264
You're just blossomin'.

55:02.266 --> 55:05.636
Dolly would be really proud
of you, Dolly.

55:06.937 --> 55:09.440
And we just fit, you and I.

55:13.110 --> 55:16.246
Still, here we are,

55:16.280 --> 55:19.384
both of us lonely.

56:23.347 --> 56:24.949
Okey-dokey.

56:24.982 --> 56:26.651
Five, six, seven, eight...

56:26.684 --> 56:28.052
OK.

56:28.085 --> 56:30.054
Well... Alright.

56:30.087 --> 56:32.623
You got your own room
for your private gal time.

56:32.657 --> 56:34.124
Mm-hm.

56:34.158 --> 56:36.894
And don't worry. I'm not too
far away. Just over there.

56:36.927 --> 56:40.565
Spare key set cut
for front and back door

56:40.598 --> 56:42.399
just in case you get
locked out.

56:44.334 --> 56:45.536
Huh!

56:45.570 --> 56:47.572
I guess we're doin' this.

56:47.605 --> 56:49.173
Home, sweet home!

56:53.277 --> 56:54.712
-Oh, baby.
-Mmm!

57:28.378 --> 57:29.614
Yeah!

57:32.950 --> 57:35.419
I know. I know.

57:35.452 --> 57:38.355
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please welcome

57:38.388 --> 57:41.458
our newest
master of ceremonies,

57:41.492 --> 57:44.962
the Empress of Country,

57:44.995 --> 57:46.797
Ms Dolly Parton!

57:50.901 --> 57:53.270
Thank you!

57:53.303 --> 57:55.540
Welcome, my new friends.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.808
Oh, my golly, welcome!

57:57.842 --> 58:01.078
It is important to keep
our homes open to everybody.

58:01.111 --> 58:04.715
It doesn't matter what size,
colour, shape you are.

58:04.749 --> 58:07.985
You find out who you are
and you do it on purpose.

58:11.689 --> 58:13.791
Ain't that right, Elvis?

58:14.759 --> 58:16.160
Truth is like the sun.

58:16.193 --> 58:18.896
You can shut it out for a time,
but it ain't goin' away.

58:21.431 --> 58:24.835
Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!

58:24.869 --> 58:28.272
Dolly! Dolly!
Dolly! Dolly!

59:12.516 --> 59:14.919
That's Zhang,
my new border.

59:18.355 --> 59:20.224
I'm assuming
you're worried about me

59:20.257 --> 59:22.126
and you've come to apologise

59:22.159 --> 59:24.528
for falling off
the face of the earth.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.164
I'm fine. Lost weight. Mm. See?

59:27.197 --> 59:29.399
I've come to give you some cash
for the mortgage

59:29.433 --> 59:32.136
and invite you to my gig,

59:32.169 --> 59:34.905
which is at your
favourite theatre,

59:34.939 --> 59:36.874
Twin Palms.

59:36.907 --> 59:40.544
Hmm. A step up from
the school talent contest.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.813
I'll come for a laugh.

59:42.847 --> 59:45.716
No, Mum, don't come for a laugh.

59:46.951 --> 59:48.385
It's serious!

59:48.418 --> 59:51.455
I mean, they're talking
Nashville and a US tour.

59:52.422 --> 59:54.892
I can't win with you.

1:00:04.234 --> 1:00:07.938
I was devastated to hear that
you and Franny were a joke.

1:00:08.906 --> 1:00:10.440
How cruel.

1:00:54.518 --> 1:00:57.121
Alright! Alright!

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:58.622
It's her problem!

1:01:01.692 --> 1:01:04.228
"Kenny in the Kimberley."
Got a great ring to it.

1:01:04.261 --> 1:01:05.996
How long till you're back?

1:01:06.030 --> 1:01:09.399
It's only two weeks, baby,
but...I'll miss you.

1:01:09.433 --> 1:01:11.501
-Mm-hm.
-I will.

1:01:11.535 --> 1:01:13.303
At home, on stage,

1:01:13.337 --> 1:01:15.873
backstage, everywhere.

1:01:19.109 --> 1:01:20.745
I'll give you a call
once I land.

1:01:20.778 --> 1:01:22.179
OK.

1:01:31.621 --> 1:01:35.659
My weapons
of mass distraction. Hm.

1:01:36.626 --> 1:01:37.661
Hmm!

1:01:38.896 --> 1:01:41.698
Mm, let's do this.

1:01:56.413 --> 1:01:57.915
Here we go.

1:01:59.483 --> 1:02:01.651
Little sting.
Little prick.

1:02:07.024 --> 1:02:09.359
Everything's
gonna be alright.

1:02:11.095 --> 1:02:12.997
Yeah.

1:03:58.268 --> 1:03:59.836
Hey, it's OK.

1:03:59.870 --> 1:04:02.139
You're in recovery
and this is normal.

1:04:02.172 --> 1:04:05.509
Your body is naturally
going into protective mode

1:04:05.542 --> 1:04:07.577
and is rejecting the implants,
which is absolutely...

1:04:07.611 --> 1:04:09.246
-Normal.
-..normal.

1:04:09.279 --> 1:04:11.081
Oh.

1:04:11.115 --> 1:04:12.749
I'll go and get you
some morphine.

1:04:12.782 --> 1:04:14.151
OK.

1:04:14.184 --> 1:04:17.587
Oh, and your next of kin
is waiting for you outside.

1:04:17.621 --> 1:04:19.656
Oh, shit.

1:04:22.392 --> 1:04:25.529
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Yes, yes!

1:04:25.562 --> 1:04:29.733
Franwa, hello!

1:04:30.834 --> 1:04:34.238
Do I look 'boobiful'?
I can't say it!

1:04:35.672 --> 1:04:37.474
-Why are you so angry?

1:04:38.408 --> 1:04:40.410
Everything's gonna be alright.

1:04:55.359 --> 1:04:57.161
Cutting yourself
to be beautiful

1:04:57.194 --> 1:04:59.463
is unbelievable to me.

1:04:59.496 --> 1:05:00.830
It's fucking stupid!

1:05:00.864 --> 1:05:02.699
Oh, why are you so jacked up

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:04.468
about what I do with
my body anyway?

1:05:04.501 --> 1:05:05.835
Because I'm your mate

1:05:05.869 --> 1:05:07.704
trying to stop you
from making dumb choices.

1:05:07.737 --> 1:05:09.506
Well, I don't need saving.

1:05:09.539 --> 1:05:11.575
I'm not trying to save you.

1:05:11.608 --> 1:05:13.877
I'm trying to love you,
you arsehole!

1:05:17.347 --> 1:05:19.849
Ow.

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:25.555
If you hadn't had your head
so far up your arse,

1:05:25.589 --> 1:05:27.891
you'd know
I've actually met someone.

1:05:47.377 --> 1:05:49.179
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:05:49.213 --> 1:05:51.848
I am back and I am
better than ever!

1:05:55.986 --> 1:05:58.922
I've always had big'uns,
just not this big.

1:05:59.889 --> 1:06:01.525
I used to be a little
champagne glass

1:06:01.558 --> 1:06:03.093
and now I'm a watermelon.

1:06:03.127 --> 1:06:05.095
-Whoo!

1:06:34.991 --> 1:06:36.526
Oh...

1:06:41.331 --> 1:06:43.433
Who is the real Kenny?

1:06:54.378 --> 1:06:56.446
Oh, where is this guy?

1:07:00.450 --> 1:07:02.652
Kenny, Kenny,
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny!

1:07:04.288 --> 1:07:05.822
You're part synthetic.

1:07:05.855 --> 1:07:08.692
Well,
I think that's probably true.

1:07:08.725 --> 1:07:11.995
I think a part
of what magic I may have

1:07:12.028 --> 1:07:13.797
as far as my personality

1:07:13.830 --> 1:07:15.799
is the fact that I look
totally artificial

1:07:15.832 --> 1:07:17.601
and I like to think
that I'm totally real.

1:07:18.835 --> 1:07:20.504
Do you see yourself
as a sex symbol?

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:22.172
I feel sexy.

1:07:22.206 --> 1:07:25.542
I...I try to be, uh,
sexy, I guess...

1:07:25.575 --> 1:07:27.277
Is that my star man?

1:07:27.311 --> 1:07:30.514
I got an early flight
'cause I missed my girl!

1:07:31.515 --> 1:07:32.982
I got presents!

1:07:33.016 --> 1:07:36.486
Whoo-hoo-hoo, girl!

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:39.055
Yeah...girls!

1:07:39.089 --> 1:07:41.691
I'm 100% committed.

1:07:41.725 --> 1:07:44.027
-Hmm.
-You wanna feel 'em?

1:07:48.698 --> 1:07:51.101
-Right?

1:07:52.236 --> 1:07:53.737
Why'd you do that?

1:07:53.770 --> 1:07:56.005
Because the other ones
weren't working.

1:07:58.442 --> 1:08:01.278
I hadn't noticed,
but I'm a butt man, so...

1:08:02.279 --> 1:08:03.780
Huh.

1:08:04.781 --> 1:08:06.883
Well, these are real.

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:10.187
Sure thing, Doll.
I hope they make you happy.

1:08:12.856 --> 1:08:14.824
So...so, um...

1:08:14.858 --> 1:08:17.961
Yeah, it's a little messy,
but I'm gettin' to it.

1:08:24.468 --> 1:08:26.102
Have, uh, you been...

1:08:27.103 --> 1:08:29.273
..you been going
through my things?

1:08:32.776 --> 1:08:35.179
Lookin' for what?

1:08:35.212 --> 1:08:38.382
Your momma. Your friends.

1:08:38.415 --> 1:08:40.284
More about the real you.

1:08:40.317 --> 1:08:42.452
I...I am real.

1:08:44.954 --> 1:08:46.890
So how'd you get here?

1:08:48.558 --> 1:08:50.560
Do you miss your old self?

1:08:53.797 --> 1:08:55.732
Come on, now.

1:08:56.933 --> 1:08:59.269
You can't just be
a cardboard cut-out.

1:08:59.303 --> 1:09:00.937
Well...

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:06.176
Kenny Rogers, baby.

1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:24.994
You OK?

1:09:28.164 --> 1:09:30.066
Red, the Twin Palms Theatre
has sold out.

1:09:30.099 --> 1:09:31.968
-Mm.
-Congratulations!

1:09:32.001 --> 1:09:33.437
Oh...

1:09:34.438 --> 1:09:36.773
Dolly's finally taken over, hey?

1:09:36.806 --> 1:09:38.808
What does Kenny think
of your new equipment?

1:09:41.110 --> 1:09:43.146
He's a butt man.

1:09:43.179 --> 1:09:45.849
But I didn't do it for him.
I did it for myself.

1:09:49.519 --> 1:09:52.155
You alright?

1:09:52.188 --> 1:09:54.190
-Oh!

1:09:54.224 --> 1:09:55.692
Night.

1:09:55.725 --> 1:09:58.395
-Oh.

1:10:01.231 --> 1:10:03.300
Hey, Dolly.

1:10:03.333 --> 1:10:05.835
So how's it been
fillin' my shoes,

1:10:05.869 --> 1:10:08.171
takin' my job, hm?

1:10:08.204 --> 1:10:11.308
You think you're so
fuckin' special.

1:10:11.341 --> 1:10:12.509
Nothin' real about me...

1:10:12.542 --> 1:10:14.478
-..'cept my heart.
-'Cept my heart. Mm.

1:10:18.915 --> 1:10:21.318
Those look real fake.

1:10:21.351 --> 1:10:23.520
Your opinion
means nothin' to me.

1:10:24.554 --> 1:10:26.523
Well, then, you won't
mind me reminding you

1:10:26.556 --> 1:10:27.991
of who you really are.

1:10:28.024 --> 1:10:30.860
I know what's under that wig...

1:10:32.562 --> 1:10:34.298
..Raylene.

1:10:34.331 --> 1:10:36.032
-Hey!

1:10:36.065 --> 1:10:37.200
I...

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:39.336
-I...

1:10:41.271 --> 1:10:43.373
It's so easy for you.

1:10:46.510 --> 1:10:48.378
You have no idea.

1:10:53.583 --> 1:10:55.752
It's not easy for any of us!

1:11:22.446 --> 1:11:24.213
You're seriously red

1:11:24.247 --> 1:11:26.182
and you have no titties.

1:11:26.215 --> 1:11:28.117
It's nothin' personal,
darlin', but, uh,

1:11:28.151 --> 1:11:30.454
the truth is like the sun.

1:11:30.487 --> 1:11:32.055
You can shut it out for a time,

1:11:32.088 --> 1:11:34.190
but it ain't goin' away.

1:11:34.223 --> 1:11:35.459
Oh!

1:11:55.645 --> 1:11:56.913
Mmm!

1:11:56.946 --> 1:11:59.048
Dolly, honey.

1:11:59.082 --> 1:12:00.650
-Quit, quit, quit...
-Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:12:02.118 --> 1:12:05.722
Baby, stop! Dolly, this is
serious business, alright?

1:12:05.755 --> 1:12:08.091
Now, I want to show you
something, alright?

1:12:20.303 --> 1:12:23.106
My daddy, he was in the army.

1:12:23.139 --> 1:12:25.509
He made me shave it all off.

1:12:25.542 --> 1:12:27.276
He was violent.

1:12:29.546 --> 1:12:31.381
He was a real piece of work.

1:12:33.316 --> 1:12:35.852
One of the saddest days
of my childhood.

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:44.260
Just because
you lost your fuzz

1:12:44.293 --> 1:12:46.396
don't mean you ain't a peach.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.069
You're a good man, Kenny.

1:12:55.472 --> 1:12:57.441
Hey.

1:12:57.474 --> 1:12:58.975
You're a good man.

1:13:03.547 --> 1:13:05.582
I wanna meet your mom.

1:13:07.651 --> 1:13:09.853
Uh-huh.

1:13:14.558 --> 1:13:16.092
Mm.

1:13:19.395 --> 1:13:21.698
-And, darling?
-Mm?

1:13:21.731 --> 1:13:23.933
Breasts?

1:13:25.569 --> 1:13:28.204
Well, I get to
choose what I do with my body

1:13:28.237 --> 1:13:29.873
because it's mine.

1:13:29.906 --> 1:13:31.541
If people have gotta
look at you,

1:13:31.575 --> 1:13:34.177
at least give them somethin'
decent to look at.

1:13:34.210 --> 1:13:35.879
Ain't that right, Zhang?

1:13:35.912 --> 1:13:37.681
And what about you two?

1:13:37.714 --> 1:13:40.484
-Francis introduced us.
-Mm!

1:13:48.958 --> 1:13:50.393
Mm.

1:13:52.295 --> 1:13:56.199
Viv...this chicken is delicious.

1:13:56.232 --> 1:14:00.403
Oh, thank you...Kenny.

1:14:00.436 --> 1:14:02.071
It's not too dry?

1:14:02.105 --> 1:14:05.241
Oh! So tender.

1:14:07.410 --> 1:14:08.578
I'll get it.

1:14:08.612 --> 1:14:11.715
Thank you.

1:14:12.916 --> 1:14:14.551
Hey, Zhang.

1:14:14.584 --> 1:14:16.686
-Oh, darling, hello!
-Hi!

1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:19.055
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

1:14:19.088 --> 1:14:21.390
Red, this is Betty.

1:14:21.424 --> 1:14:23.727
Oh, Dolly, Betty.

1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:25.294
It's so great
you're finally here

1:14:25.328 --> 1:14:26.730
and I get to meet you!

1:14:26.763 --> 1:14:30.066
It's funny. I get
'Ruby' all the time.

1:14:30.099 --> 1:14:31.868
So sorry
we're late, Viv.

1:14:31.901 --> 1:14:34.270
I'm Kenny, man.
Nice to meet you.

1:14:34.303 --> 1:14:35.672
-Hi.
-Pleasure.

1:14:37.406 --> 1:14:39.108
Thank you.

1:14:47.083 --> 1:14:48.718
You can trump last time.

1:14:50.286 --> 1:14:52.121
So what do you do?

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:54.490
I'm...I'm a lawyer.

1:14:54.524 --> 1:14:56.960
Very serious job,
not like yours.

1:14:58.962 --> 1:15:01.931
Oh, I'm very
proud of my girl.

1:15:01.965 --> 1:15:03.567
She has worked hard.

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:06.302
This little Dolly,
she's dynamite.

1:15:06.335 --> 1:15:09.105
The kid always
had the spirit in her.

1:15:09.138 --> 1:15:12.576
Nice one, Gramps.
He's a wise guy.

1:15:12.609 --> 1:15:16.279
Well, blessings don't come
without difficulties.

1:15:16.312 --> 1:15:17.847
Amen.

1:15:20.216 --> 1:15:22.752
I'd love to see
your garden, Viv.

1:15:22.786 --> 1:15:25.421
Darling, of course!

1:15:25.454 --> 1:15:28.958
I had let it go,
but Lionel and Zhang and I

1:15:28.992 --> 1:15:32.629
have been working very hard
in the garden.

1:15:32.662 --> 1:15:34.764
-Mm. Let's go. Let's go!
-Let me get that.

1:15:34.798 --> 1:15:37.000
-Come on!
-Hm? OK, right now?

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:39.435
Oh, thank you. Aw!

1:15:39.468 --> 1:15:41.337
-My pleasure.
-Excuse me.

1:15:41.370 --> 1:15:43.439
Come on, love.

1:15:43.472 --> 1:15:45.675
Yours is a mashed potato!

1:15:45.709 --> 1:15:46.943
Ahh!

1:15:46.976 --> 1:15:49.412
Oh, it's good
to see you, Red.

1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:51.981
'Dwinks'!

1:16:08.898 --> 1:16:10.667
Whee!

1:16:10.700 --> 1:16:12.802
Whoo!

1:16:12.836 --> 1:16:15.672
So what's
the hardest case you've had?

1:16:15.705 --> 1:16:20.376
Ooh, yeah,
I had this one absolute...

1:16:28.217 --> 1:16:30.319
You are out of your mind!

1:16:30.353 --> 1:16:33.089
-Franny, Franny...
-What are you doing?

1:16:35.124 --> 1:16:38.427
Dolly Parton is about being
the best version of yourself,

1:16:38.461 --> 1:16:41.464
but to never take yourself
too seriously.

1:16:42.465 --> 1:16:44.600
You're living as someone else,

1:16:44.634 --> 1:16:46.936
with someone else

1:16:46.970 --> 1:16:49.005
who is also living as
someone else!

1:16:49.038 --> 1:16:51.374
Yeah, so?

1:16:51.407 --> 1:16:53.509
That's the gig!

1:16:53.542 --> 1:16:57.714
And life is working
unbelievably better this way.

1:16:57.747 --> 1:16:59.382
And he is who he is,

1:16:59.415 --> 1:17:01.050
which is a version
of someone else,

1:17:01.084 --> 1:17:02.451
and you're you, which is you,

1:17:02.485 --> 1:17:04.087
which I'm sure
is a version of yourself

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:06.055
and I'm sure
probably someone else!

1:17:06.089 --> 1:17:07.290
You're lost.

1:17:07.323 --> 1:17:09.325
If you're busy
being someone else...

1:17:12.095 --> 1:17:14.497
..who's busy being you?

1:17:47.430 --> 1:17:49.799
What am I gonna do, Dolly?

1:17:52.501 --> 1:17:55.338
It's OK to be nervous.
Tomorrow's show is a big deal.

1:17:55.371 --> 1:17:56.973
I don't know
what's wrong with me!

1:17:58.374 --> 1:18:00.343
The more unique you are
as a person,

1:18:00.376 --> 1:18:02.645
the harder it is
to be someone else.

1:18:02.678 --> 1:18:04.848
That's why Kenny
does it so well.

1:18:04.881 --> 1:18:08.484
He was just
a blank canvas before.

1:18:08.517 --> 1:18:10.353
He was a starter kit.

1:18:11.554 --> 1:18:13.089
Being Kenny Rogers

1:18:13.122 --> 1:18:16.659
gave him more than he ever
would've had without it.

1:18:16.692 --> 1:18:18.627
Why did you stop being
Neil Diamond

1:18:18.661 --> 1:18:20.496
when you were so successful?

1:18:21.898 --> 1:18:24.300
I was tired
of ripping myself off...

1:18:25.468 --> 1:18:28.805
..ripping my wife off
being someone else.

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.743
The only applause I ever
really needed was from her.

1:18:35.044 --> 1:18:37.113
I realised that too late.

1:18:37.146 --> 1:18:39.082
But who are you?

1:18:41.384 --> 1:18:46.022
I mean, are...are you a copy,
are you a copy-copy?

1:18:46.055 --> 1:18:48.624
You're still walking around
like you're Neil Diamond.

1:18:48.657 --> 1:18:50.994
You ever read about a frog
who dreamed of being a king

1:18:51.027 --> 1:18:52.695
and then became one?

1:18:56.732 --> 1:18:59.502
Except for the names
and a few other places,

1:18:59.535 --> 1:19:02.906
when you talk about me,
the story's the same one.

1:19:41.644 --> 1:19:43.179
You got this, kid.

1:20:25.955 --> 1:20:27.756
It's all a bit ridiculous.

1:20:30.193 --> 1:20:33.262
You get your looks from me,
though, obviously.

1:20:51.514 --> 1:20:52.781
Hello, love.

1:21:05.661 --> 1:21:07.964
Ladies and
gentlemen, take your seats.

1:21:07.997 --> 1:21:10.499
The show you've all
been waiting for!

1:23:25.268 --> 1:23:28.304
Thank you, folks!
Thank you very much!

1:23:28.337 --> 1:23:29.938
Yee-ha!

1:23:29.972 --> 1:23:32.241
Oh, wow! Wow!

1:23:34.643 --> 1:23:37.180
I, um...

1:23:37.213 --> 1:23:42.985
I...I usually keep my cards
pretty close to my chest.

1:23:43.018 --> 1:23:45.788
But tonight I got
something to say.

1:23:45.821 --> 1:23:48.924
I LOVE you, baby!

1:23:50.459 --> 1:23:53.262
I love you, I love you,
I love you!

1:23:53.296 --> 1:23:55.831
-Kenny...
-Heaven and earth.

1:23:56.832 --> 1:23:59.235
-Oh, no.

1:24:04.507 --> 1:24:05.841
Marry me.

1:24:05.874 --> 1:24:08.177
Oh, Kenny...

1:24:08.211 --> 1:24:10.946
He's just foolin' around.
Come on, baby.

1:24:10.979 --> 1:24:12.648
Marry me, baby. This is it.

1:24:12.681 --> 1:24:14.950
This is the way
it's meant to be.

1:24:14.983 --> 1:24:16.552
What do you say, folks?

1:24:19.322 --> 1:24:20.823
It's definitely not a joke.

1:24:20.856 --> 1:24:23.226
Well, he's never
really been that funny.

1:24:23.259 --> 1:24:26.095
I want all of you
to share in this moment.

1:24:27.596 --> 1:24:29.265
Babe, I love you.

1:24:32.368 --> 1:24:34.803
Kenny, you're not
in love with me.

1:24:34.837 --> 1:24:36.705
I am.

1:24:36.739 --> 1:24:38.407
Baby, I sure am.

1:24:38.441 --> 1:24:40.309
Kenny, don't do this.

1:24:42.010 --> 1:24:44.713
I thought that this
was what you wanted.

1:24:59.428 --> 1:25:01.197
-I can't do this.

1:25:03.632 --> 1:25:05.801
I'm not the girl
you want, Kenny.

1:25:07.470 --> 1:25:09.305
I'm not her.

1:25:15.778 --> 1:25:19.582
But that silly-billy Dolly...

1:25:21.717 --> 1:25:25.221
..taught me all the things that
you loved, that I pretended.

1:25:33.996 --> 1:25:37.733
To have confidence in yourself.

1:25:39.802 --> 1:25:42.471
And that bravery
is vulnerability.

1:25:43.906 --> 1:25:46.475
And to not put a value
on yourself,

1:25:46.509 --> 1:25:48.277
but value the things you love.

1:25:48.311 --> 1:25:49.712
-Oh, what...

1:25:49.745 --> 1:25:51.280
Baby, what are you doin'?

1:25:53.782 --> 1:25:55.884
Dolly's got some wisdom.

1:25:55.918 --> 1:25:57.820
Dolly's got so much wisdom.

1:25:57.853 --> 1:26:01.257
I haven't got any wisdom,
but I do know

1:26:01.290 --> 1:26:04.760
that I've got to learn to be
all those things, but as me.

1:26:06.094 --> 1:26:07.830
This is not an impulse reaction.

1:26:07.863 --> 1:26:11.099
I'm stripteasing
in a somewhat untidy fashion,

1:26:11.133 --> 1:26:14.803
all in the name
of saving myself...

1:26:21.710 --> 1:26:23.779
..and the skin that I'm in.

1:26:30.118 --> 1:26:31.487
Oh!

1:26:45.568 --> 1:26:47.303
Eeee!

1:26:56.211 --> 1:26:58.213
I love you, Mum.

1:27:00.082 --> 1:27:02.651
I love you too, darling.

1:27:05.321 --> 1:27:07.823
-She's mine!

1:27:13.262 --> 1:27:16.198
I propose and women drop
their knickers!

1:27:22.104 --> 1:27:24.307
You go back out there.
That's for you.

1:27:24.340 --> 1:27:26.642
It's OK. I don't need it.

1:27:42.891 --> 1:27:44.560
Have a good night, folks.

1:27:57.640 --> 1:27:59.408
Hm... Ohh!

1:28:01.910 --> 1:28:03.679
Ohh.

1:28:28.003 --> 1:28:29.472
Nice to see you.

1:28:29.505 --> 1:28:32.408
Ain't you all glad
that the king is back?

1:28:39.247 --> 1:28:41.316
And later on today -
and I'll say it again -

1:28:41.350 --> 1:28:43.419
I want you to have
a great day.

1:28:43.452 --> 1:28:46.054
Later on today -
and I'll say it again -

1:28:46.088 --> 1:28:47.756
I want you to have
a great day.

1:28:47.790 --> 1:28:49.758
-Kenny! Showtime!

1:28:49.792 --> 1:28:51.494
Thanks, Tom.

1:28:51.527 --> 1:28:55.230
Now, to the most outstanding
valuer of the year.

1:28:55.263 --> 1:28:58.233
I'm excited to announce
the winner is...

1:28:58.266 --> 1:28:59.468
..Francis!

1:28:59.502 --> 1:29:02.938
-Whoo!

1:29:02.971 --> 1:29:04.573
Whoo-hoo!

1:29:04.607 --> 1:29:06.442
Good work, Francis!
Good man!

1:29:06.475 --> 1:29:08.110
Go, Francis!

1:29:10.946 --> 1:29:13.916
Um, I'm terrified
at public speaking

1:29:13.949 --> 1:29:19.287
so I hoped wearing this would
give me David Bowie guts

1:29:19.321 --> 1:29:22.691
to get up here
and say thank you.

1:29:22.725 --> 1:29:24.527
So, um...

1:29:26.662 --> 1:29:28.130
..thank you.

1:29:34.970 --> 1:29:36.639
Whoo!

1:29:48.216 --> 1:29:49.852
I wasn't gonna miss it.

1:29:52.187 --> 1:29:54.022
Awards are kind of stupid.

1:29:55.591 --> 1:29:57.560
I'm really sorry, Franny.

1:29:59.728 --> 1:30:01.497
You really pushed it.

1:30:03.198 --> 1:30:05.668
-You pushed me.
-I know.

1:30:06.669 --> 1:30:08.036
I just wanted that feeling

1:30:08.070 --> 1:30:10.473
that everyone else
looks like they're having.

1:30:10.506 --> 1:30:12.374
You know,
that they're respected and...

1:30:13.576 --> 1:30:15.110
..you know.

1:30:29.458 --> 1:30:32.260
What would the world do
with two Dolly Partons?

1:30:44.807 --> 1:30:46.609
Celebrate?

1:30:53.248 --> 1:30:54.783
You know
I'm doing a new thing.

1:30:54.817 --> 1:30:56.184
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1:30:56.218 --> 1:30:57.920
I think I've kind of
found my audience.

1:30:57.953 --> 1:30:59.755
-As yourself?
-Yeah.

1:30:59.788 --> 1:31:02.024
Everyone else is taken.

1:31:15.671 --> 1:31:19.241
My name is Red
and I'm your teacher.
