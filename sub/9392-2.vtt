Our top story tonight,
we continue to track

the progress
of Hurricane Flozell.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.606
The National Weather Service

00:40.608 --> 00:42.641
has issued a Severe
Hurricane Advisory,

00:42.643 --> 00:45.210
and is urging everyone
to stay indoors

00:45.212 --> 00:46.712
for at least the next 36 hours.

Hey, kids...

an open wound,

01:02.196 --> 01:03.762
get some dirt
or kitty litter

01:03.764 --> 01:05.931
and rub it in there
to stop the bleeding.

01:05.933 --> 01:09.168
Then get some sleep and wait
for the body to heal itself.

Still drinkin'.

11:57.617 --> 12:01.519
to be treated with a little
decency from my brother?

12:01.521 --> 12:04.255
Maybe show me some
kind of kindness by not jumping

12:04.257 --> 12:06.491
on the "Let's get Meg"
family bandwagon?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.494
(lapping stops)
Aw.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.995
Alright, Meg,
that's enough.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.331
You've had your little
dramatic outburst.

(Brian lapping)
(laughs giddily)

12:15.368 --> 12:16.868
Hey, I got an idea, Mom.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.037
How about we talk about
Chris' mother? Huh?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.039
Why don't we talk about you?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.474
Oh, for God's sake.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.909
Look, let's not turn this
into some big thing, okay?

12:25.878 --> 12:28.213
Oh... Oh...

12:28.215 --> 12:30.381
Oh, God, that feels
so much better.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.350
You know, Brian,
you may be a dog,

12:32.352 --> 12:34.385
but you're a
pretty cool cat.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.659
Hey, everyone.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.699
Yes. You're right,
Brian. There is.

12:47.701 --> 12:50.001
Meg seems to think she's
taking some kind of stand here

12:50.003 --> 12:52.036
that's gonna make us all
feel like we're inadequate.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.139
My God, you're condescending.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.608
Geez, look at those two.
They're goin' at each other

12:56.610 --> 12:58.877

13:32.545 --> 13:34.879
Look, the bottom line here,
Meg, is that you're just

13:34.881 --> 13:37.382
taking your own problems
out on everyone else.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.983
Oh, my problems?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.018
Oh, I see.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.554
Is this coming from
my role model mother?

13:42.556 --> 13:43.855
The shoplifter,
the drug addict,

13:43.857 --> 13:46.357
the porn star, the whore
who let Gene Simmons

13:46.359 --> 13:48.026

Oh, so what?

All those things
are behind me now.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.432
I'm a better person now
because of those experiences.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.534
Are you?
Are you a better person?

13:56.536 --> 13:59.170
What's your point, Meg?
My point is that with

13:59.172 --> 14:00.705
all the irresponsible, reckless,

14:00.707 --> 14:03.675
idiotic behavior in
your past, that somehow,

14:03.677 --> 14:08.546
somehow you have the nerve,
the arrogance to consistently

14:08.548 --> 14:10.982
and ruthlessly point
out my shortcomings.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.517
Alright, well, fine, okay?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.485
I'm not the perfect mother.
Who is?

14:14.487 --> 14:17.388
Oh, not only are you
not the perfect mother.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.023
You're the farthest thing from.

14:19.025 --> 14:22.994
From the moment you gave birth
to me, I had to trust you.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.696
I had no choice.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.598
I needed you to protect
me from the world.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.634
To... to be my guide, to help
me navigate the difficult,

14:29.636 --> 14:33.338
confusing, and vulnerable
journey to becoming a person.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.473
You have done none
of those things.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.643
You're my mother, and you
took a child's trust

14:38.645 --> 14:42.180
and smashed it into bits in
a 17-year-long mission

14:42.182 --> 14:45.350
to destroy something that
you killed a long time ago.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.485
And honestly, when
I turn 18...

14:47.487 --> 14:50.455
I-I don't know that I ever
want to see you again.

14:52.524 --> 14:55.360
(weeping loudly)

14:55.362 --> 14:57.362
Oh wow, everybody's
already tweeting

14:57.364 --> 14:58.463
"Stewie Just Said That."

14:58.465 --> 15:01.332
You're right.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.201
You're right. I'm
a terrible mother.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.169
I'm so sorry.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.505
I'm so, so sorry, Meg.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.707
Can you ever forgive me?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.843
Oh, God.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.014
And you never let Dad
stir the paint anymore,

15:16.016 --> 15:17.382
whatever that means.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.549
I didn't know you
knew that, Meg,

15:18.551 --> 15:19.951
but I'm glad
you brought it up.

15:25.357 --> 15:29.027
Oh, Meg, I don't
know what to say.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.497
All of those things you
said about me are true.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.533
I have been a very
bad mother to you.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.535
I have no excuse.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.038
I just have this horrible,
overwhelming desire

15:40.040 --> 15:41.439
to point out faults in you.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.541
I don't know
where it comes from.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.677
Maybe it's because
I'm self-conscious

15:45.679 --> 15:47.812
about being a bad parent.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.348
I'm just, I'm so disgusted
with my behavior.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.116
And I'm so sorry, Meg.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.518
Yeah, you're a bitch.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.487
Well, you know, I, I been sorta
just hangin' back here,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.056
takin' all this in,
'cause I didn't think

15:58.058 --> 15:59.490
I had a dog in this fight,

15:59.492 --> 16:01.359
but my money's on
Harry Potter over there.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.328
Oh, you think
that's funny, fat ass?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.529
Well, I don't know
if it's funny.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.596
I-I think it's clever.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.966
I mean, y-y-you got
the big glasses there...

16:07.968 --> 16:10.435
I-I-I don't know. T-T-Tell me,
tell me what's on your mind.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.637
Oh, I'll tell you,
Mister Selfish-ass Dad.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.940
Hey. That's "Mister
Mister selfish-ass Dad"

16:15.942 --> 16:16.708
to you, young lady.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.609
Oh God, is she gonna do me next?

16:18.611 --> 16:20.545
You are completely selfish,

16:20.547 --> 16:22.714
and totally irresponsible
as a father.

16:22.716 --> 16:25.616
All right, I see what's
goin' on here.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.051
You're in love
with your old man.

16:27.053 --> 16:30.521
You have no education,
you have no interests,

16:30.523 --> 16:32.690
you just do whatever
reckless thing you want to do

16:32.692 --> 16:36.127
whenever you want to do it
without regard for anyone else.

16:36.129 --> 16:39.764
Oh, oh, and when you're not
terrorizing the community

16:39.766 --> 16:41.466
with your impulsive escapades,

16:41.468 --> 16:43.801
you're being a total
jerk to your family.

16:43.803 --> 16:47.538
You shove your daughter's face
in your ass and you fart on it.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.273
If someone
in the outside world

16:49.275 --> 16:52.610
could see the way you treat
me, you would be in jail!

16:52.612 --> 16:55.480
Oh, ha ha. Oh, this
is amusing to you.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.548
Well, see if you
find this funny.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.183
I like where this is going.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.552
You are a fat,
lazy, abusive,

17:01.554 --> 17:03.521
blue-collar
Irish Catholic dad

17:03.523 --> 17:05.056
who drinks way too much

17:05.058 --> 17:07.525
and barely makes enough
money to support his family.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.127
You've lived half your life,

17:09.129 --> 17:11.929
and you have nothing
to show for it.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.866
Your only arguable
accomplishments are your kids,

17:14.868 --> 17:18.336
and look at us;
we're a disaster.
Eh, watch it.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.305
You're a total and
complete embarrassment

17:21.307 --> 17:23.341
in every possible way.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.610
Take a good look at yourself,
Peter Griffin.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.712
You're a waste of a man.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.516
Wait a second,
these are criticisms.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.017
Hey, Lois, tell her
to knock it off.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.553
Oh, and where the hell were you
when she was laying into me?

17:35.555 --> 17:37.655
I was thinking about
getting a fancy cane.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.557
Maybe getting more
attention from strangers.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.126
Have either of you guys
been listening to me?

17:42.128 --> 17:44.796
Do you both just have
your heads up your asses?

17:44.798 --> 17:47.832
Dad did! Look, he's got
crap on his ears!

17:47.834 --> 17:48.633
That's unrelated.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.168
Chris, I don't like
that language.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.702
Well, I don't like your cooking.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.638
Well, I don't like having
to literally empty

17:53.640 --> 17:55.873
the farts out of your pockets
whenever I do your laundry.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.508
You're the one
who's always cookin'

17:57.510 --> 17:59.444
Brussels sprouts
and broccoli.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.879
It's like an Irish
bar fight down there.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.916
You're from one town over,
so I hate your guts.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.655
Why don't we ever
get any good food?!

18:10.657 --> 18:12.490
Yeah, Bonnie gives
Joe Wonder Bread.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.292
Well, then go live
at Bonnie's house.

18:14.294 --> 18:18.329
and not have to answer your
stupid questions at 5:00 a.m.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.431
My curiosity peaks
in the morning!

18:20.433 --> 18:21.666
You eat all my
Dannon yogurts!

18:21.668 --> 18:23.101
I don't see your
name on 'em!

18:23.103 --> 18:25.369
You don't even like them!
But you know I do,

18:25.371 --> 18:26.971
and you don't want
me to have them!

18:26.973 --> 18:28.539
You know, I've never
confronted you on it,

18:28.541 --> 18:30.441
but I've often thought
the same thing, Peter.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.376
Yeah, that's y
what he do!

18:32.378 --> 18:34.345
'Cause he's a selfish,
fat idiot!

18:34.347 --> 18:35.947
You shut up,
all of yous!

18:37.616 --> 18:40.918
I didn't ask to
be in this family!

18:42.287 --> 18:43.621
Ugh, I'll go get him.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.190
Peter? You
come back here!

18:46.192 --> 18:49.127
I faked all my orgasms!

18:52.998 --> 18:54.465
Hey.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.468
What's goin' on?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.937
You know, that was, uh,
that was pretty cool

18:59.939 --> 19:01.839
the way you finally
stood up to everybody.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.541
I don't know, Brian.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.643
I mean, I, I meant
every word of it, but...

19:05.645 --> 19:08.479
you saw what happened.
What do you mean?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.882
They all turned on each other
like a pack of wolves.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.783
Well, so what? That's
not your problem.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.153
Do you think it's
possible that...

19:15.155 --> 19:17.622
that this family can't
survive without some sort of

19:17.624 --> 19:19.857
lightning rod to absorb
all the dysfunction?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.359
Well, that's a...

19:21.361 --> 19:22.693
that's a theory, I guess.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.597
I mean, it-- it's not ideal,
but it's an important piece

19:26.599 --> 19:29.634
that maybe it's just my
lot in life to provide.

19:29.636 --> 19:33.137
Maybe if I feel bad,
they don't have to.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.939
Wow.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.608
You know, that's incredibly
noble and mature, Meg.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.177
You know, I think you might be

19:39.179 --> 19:41.012
the strongest person
in this house.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.346
You mean that, Brian?

19:42.348 --> 19:43.781
Absolutely.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.320
Mom? Dad?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.556
(Peter whimpering)

19:51.558 --> 19:53.391
(sniffling, whimpering)

19:53.393 --> 19:54.659
Dad?
Go away!

19:54.661 --> 19:56.260
Dad, come out of there.

19:56.262 --> 20:00.364
No! I don't deserve no better
than livin' with the shoes!

20:00.366 --> 20:01.766
Peter, there you are.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.534
You guys, I have
something to say.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.771
You're right.
It's all my fault.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.207
What?
Mom, you're an amazing mother

20:09.209 --> 20:11.809
and all the things I said
about you were out of anger,

20:11.811 --> 20:13.711
and I didn't mean any of them.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.614
Chris, you're an
outstanding brother.

20:16.616 --> 20:20.551
What I said about you was more
about me being a rotten sister.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.555
And Dad, I'm so sorry that
I made you feel this way.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.790
You don't deserve it.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.792
None of you have
done anything wrong.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.328
I took all my problems
out on you guys,

20:30.330 --> 20:31.963
and that wasn't fair.

20:31.965 --> 20:35.700
Oh, so this was all about you,
it wasn't about us.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.434
Yeah.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.802
Alright, that makes sense.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.438
See, I thought it was
weird that I was a bad dad.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.373
Meg, how could you put
us all through that?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.041
I'm sorry, you guys.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.977
You're a (bleep) bitch!

20:45.979 --> 20:47.144
Yes.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.446
Yes, I am.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.391
was a very special episode
about drug use.

21:00.393 --> 21:03.527
But the simple fact is,
it's no laughing matter.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.030
To learn more about drugs,
visit your local library.

21:06.032 --> 21:09.700
There's probably a guy behind
there who sells drugs.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.502
Good night.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.838
