Well, I didn't watch him leave,
if that's what you're asking.

11:14.552 --> 11:16.385
Any idea where he went?

11:16.410 --> 11:18.178
He didn't say.

11:19.451 --> 11:20.928
<i>How do you two know each other?</i>

11:20.953 --> 11:24.101
Well, life sometimes
brings people together.

11:24.582 --> 11:26.312
It's been years.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.230
Well, you just got out of prison.

11:28.942 --> 11:31.042
It seems odd he would owe you money.

11:31.164 --> 11:33.531
Like I said, it's been years.

11:33.556 --> 11:35.404
What did he borrow the money for?

11:35.872 --> 11:38.866
What we all need it for, to survive.

11:53.437 --> 11:55.883
Allie, do you want to talk about it?

11:57.999 --> 12:00.595
I know you're upset
about your grandfather.

12:01.876 --> 12:03.766
He seems like a nice man.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.602
Yes, he does.

12:05.870 --> 12:07.102
He knows stories about my mom

12:07.127 --> 12:09.814
that even Uncle Nathan doesn't know.

12:13.141 --> 12:15.318
Do you think he's telling the truth?

12:18.188 --> 12:20.158
I really don't know.

12:22.295 --> 12:24.078
But I hope so.

12:27.171 --> 12:28.998
He bought a couple of rounds

12:29.023 --> 12:31.056
made quite a few friends that night.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.961
How much money was he flashing around.

12:33.332 --> 12:34.732
Couldn't say.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.506
It was quite a bit.

12:36.785 --> 12:38.633
Is there anything else
you could tell me.

12:39.270 --> 12:41.068
He was a friendly guy.

12:41.478 --> 12:43.211
Played darts for a while.

12:43.236 --> 12:44.891
He stayed late.

12:45.656 --> 12:46.989
Any cards?

12:47.014 --> 12:48.310
No.

12:52.492 --> 12:55.193
I'm sorry that your dad is in trouble.

12:56.018 --> 12:57.737
Can't be easy.

12:58.739 --> 13:00.405
I'm used to it.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.653
Oh, hi.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.964
I need 34 of these doo-hickeys
made a little bit longer

13:11.989 --> 13:13.700
so they're about an inch long.

13:13.809 --> 13:14.973
Doo-hickey?

13:14.998 --> 13:17.356
I don't know what they're
called but I know what they do.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.111
The back of my switchboard
is full of them

13:19.136 --> 13:21.103
and lately my connections
have been spotty.

13:21.128 --> 13:23.054
The longer one of these will fix that.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.199
Got it.

"A modern woman connecting the world."

13:28.050 --> 13:29.249
Excuse me?

13:29.274 --> 13:31.729
It's what the magazine
article said about you.

13:31.941 --> 13:36.110
Oh, some of that was
exaggerated by the writer,

13:36.135 --> 13:37.485
sort of embarrassing.

13:37.803 --> 13:39.035
It shouldn't be.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.948
You should be proud of yourself.
We all are.

13:43.764 --> 13:45.798
I can have these ready
in about three days.

13:45.823 --> 13:47.369
Thanks.

13:53.598 --> 13:54.838
How did it go?

13:54.863 --> 13:56.962
He swears he didn't take that necklace.

13:57.757 --> 13:59.213
Yeah, I know.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.676
He ever done something like this before?

14:02.084 --> 14:04.261
Petty theft, here and there.

14:05.054 --> 14:06.721
It seems like he's hiding something.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.640
I got the same feeling.

14:09.528 --> 14:11.476
I'm heading to Benson Hills.

14:11.613 --> 14:13.893
Nathan... the Mounties in Benson Hills

14:13.918 --> 14:15.685
are handling this investigation.

14:15.710 --> 14:17.191
I know.

14:17.498 --> 14:19.693
But I need to see for myself.

14:21.975 --> 14:23.642
I know what will make you feel better...

14:23.667 --> 14:25.963
how about an ice cream?

14:26.572 --> 14:28.477
Can I have a double scoop?

14:28.502 --> 14:30.704
You can have a triple scoop.

14:32.822 --> 14:34.388
I'll meet you inside.

14:35.925 --> 14:37.032
Hello.

14:37.057 --> 14:38.211
Hi.

14:39.519 --> 14:41.353
So, how is the writing coming along?

14:41.521 --> 14:44.009
I have already written a few chapters.

14:44.034 --> 14:46.803
Well, you work fast.

14:47.626 --> 14:50.100
Anything you want to share?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.602
I'm not sure it's quite ready yet.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.271
Sooner or later you're going
to have to show somebody

14:56.464 --> 14:57.931
unless you want to keep it hidden

14:57.956 --> 14:59.806
in your desk drawer forever.

14:59.996 --> 15:02.027
But I have read your work before.

15:03.666 --> 15:07.450
Alright. But remember it is
still a work in progress.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.393
I won't forget.

15:14.671 --> 15:16.838
Why don't you drop the
pages by at the saloon?

15:16.944 --> 15:18.209
I will.

15:18.234 --> 15:19.544
Okay.

15:23.404 --> 15:24.955
How's the writing going?

15:25.116 --> 15:26.677
It's coming along.

15:26.895 --> 15:28.461
That's good.

15:28.619 --> 15:30.379
I'm heading to Benson Hills for...

15:30.404 --> 15:31.849
to see about the stolen necklace?

15:31.874 --> 15:34.627
Yes. I should be gone
for about a day or two.

15:35.944 --> 15:39.595
I was wondering if, um...

15:39.689 --> 15:42.233
I would be happy to look after Allie.

15:42.630 --> 15:44.194
Are you sure?

15:44.481 --> 15:46.140
We'll bake cookies and play games.

15:46.165 --> 15:47.447
It will be fun.

15:47.483 --> 15:49.970
You know she just has
such an ease around you.

15:50.219 --> 15:54.205
I just... She really needs
us right now so thank you.

15:55.077 --> 15:56.873
Of course.

16:08.175 --> 16:11.054
I think Little Jack is finally down.

16:11.749 --> 16:14.016
Oh, that's so beautiful.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.749
Our old house.

16:15.870 --> 16:17.853
Where I lived with my mom.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.357
It looks very cozy.

16:21.767 --> 16:25.361
I remember the house,
but not much of her.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.029
I wish I knew her better.

16:29.049 --> 16:31.159
I was only four when...

16:33.433 --> 16:35.120
I know.

16:37.801 --> 16:40.792
Life doesn't always seem fair, does it?

16:41.295 --> 16:43.879
That's why I'd like to talk to grandpa.

16:44.064 --> 16:45.880
He has stories about her.

16:47.133 --> 16:49.384
I wish Uncle Nathan would understand.

16:49.970 --> 16:54.060
Oh, Allie, your uncle
really cares about you.

16:54.085 --> 16:57.892
He's just... he's just
trying to protect you.

16:57.993 --> 17:01.564
If he cared about me
he'd let me see grandpa.

17:05.936 --> 17:09.939
You know, every time I
see your uncle in town,

17:09.964 --> 17:12.490
he's always talking about you?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.075
He is?

17:14.531 --> 17:16.035
To everyone.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.751
About how proud he is of you
and all of the amazing things

17:19.776 --> 17:21.958
that you are going to
accomplish in your life.

17:22.492 --> 17:24.586
About how you make him laugh.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.047
He talks about you a lot too.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.510
Really?

<i>Ms. Carter, Carson Shepherd
spoke highly of you.</i>

18:06.853 --> 18:08.486
<i>I'm fine, thank you.</i>

18:08.511 --> 18:11.278
<i>I hope you don't mind but I
telephoned the nursing school</i>

18:11.303 --> 18:13.563
<i>you attended and they confirmed</i>

18:13.588 --> 18:16.204
<i>the course work you've
already completed.</i>

18:16.229 --> 18:20.383
So far as I can tell, you only
have two requisite courses

18:20.408 --> 18:23.977
to take before being eligible
to train as a doctor.

18:24.002 --> 18:28.609
Medical Pathology and
Foundations of Medicine.

18:28.638 --> 18:31.861
That's wonderful news.

18:31.886 --> 18:34.120
And I can take both at your university.

18:34.145 --> 18:35.537
Yes, and after you complete them,

18:35.562 --> 18:39.119
you can begin training under
a qualified physician.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.158
I can start right away.

18:41.183 --> 18:44.284
<i>The next sitting of Medical
Pathology starts next week,</i>

18:44.309 --> 18:46.459
<i>but unfortunately the class is full.</i>

18:47.583 --> 18:51.666
I see. How soon can I
next take the class?

18:51.849 --> 18:53.849
It's only offered once per year.

18:53.874 --> 18:55.197
Once per year?

18:55.222 --> 18:57.262
Shall I pencil you in?

18:57.665 --> 19:00.869
Uh... Yes, next year.

19:01.318 --> 19:03.268
Thank you so much, doctor.

19:09.741 --> 19:11.818
I'm looking for a Donny Edmonds.

19:15.299 --> 19:16.689
I don't have any quests registered

19:16.714 --> 19:18.825
under the name of Donny Edmonds.

19:19.154 --> 19:21.291
Did you try the other hotel?

19:21.316 --> 19:23.664
Yes, he wasn't registered there either.

19:24.223 --> 19:25.666
Thank you.

19:31.032 --> 19:32.327
Anything?

19:32.352 --> 19:34.341
I got a file on this Edmonds.

19:34.618 --> 19:35.930
Got a record.

19:35.955 --> 19:37.468
You could say that.

19:38.131 --> 19:39.763
Why wouldn't Archie mention this?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.140
Honour amongst thieves.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.601
Sorry.

19:45.106 --> 19:48.341
So what do you have on my father?

19:48.595 --> 19:51.463
Well, I have a witness who says
he saw him on the third floor

19:51.488 --> 19:53.651
near where the robbery took place.

19:54.179 --> 19:55.445
So?

19:55.546 --> 19:57.655
Your father's room is
on the second floor.

19:59.078 --> 20:02.201
Were you motivated by the fact
that my father was an ex-con?

20:02.384 --> 20:06.164
Look, I understand why you'd
want to believe your father.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.187
I'm just trying to figure
out if he actually did it.

20:09.212 --> 20:11.461
How much money was on him
when he was arrested?

20:12.030 --> 20:13.562
About $150.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.341
The necklace stolen out of that
room could fetch close to that.

20:16.504 --> 20:18.656
Between being identified
near the scene of the crime,

20:18.681 --> 20:20.366
his pattern of criminal activity,

20:20.391 --> 20:22.234
and the large sum of money found on him,

20:22.259 --> 20:23.992
there is enough
circumstantial evidence here

20:24.017 --> 20:25.725
for this charge to stick.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.395
He says he got this money
from this Edmonds.

20:28.725 --> 20:31.187
But the clerk says there
is no Edmonds registered.

20:31.212 --> 20:32.711
What does that tell you?

20:32.736 --> 20:34.192
Keep digging.

20:34.519 --> 20:37.612
Maybe he went by another name.

20:37.818 --> 20:39.251
What is his known aliases?

Uh, excuse me.

but hadn't seen him in a couple of days.

left town in a buckboard wagon.

Could be anywhere by now.

me these bridal magazines

25:29.615 --> 25:31.035

when she was supposed
to do her homework.

she let all of our hogs

He's had a rough life,
you can't even imagine.

He's in Buxton jail as we speak.

The eyewitness confirmed
that it was Donny

34:10.322 --> 34:13.844
that he saw at the scene
of the crime, not you.

34:13.869 --> 34:16.322
I never would have let him pay me back

34:16.347 --> 34:18.703
if I had known he was going
to steal that necklace.

34:18.728 --> 34:21.976
Criminals commit crimes,
it's what they do.

Growing up with a father like
me and doing what you do now,

34:27.045 --> 34:32.322
I imagine it's hard enough,
but people can change, son.

34:32.744 --> 34:36.899
If they are strong enough and
motivated to do the right thing

34:36.924 --> 34:39.036

34:53.376 --> 34:54.773
He didn't do it.

He did not.

34:56.110 --> 34:57.163
Thank you.

34:57.188 --> 35:01.433
There's no need I'm just so
happy it worked out this way.

35:02.383 --> 35:06.314
I spend so many years
being angry at him.

35:08.572 --> 35:13.988
He made some terrible decisions
but it is clear he loves you,

35:15.576 --> 35:18.450
and I can tell you love him too.

35:19.519 --> 35:22.413
He needs his family now
more than ever, Nathan.

35:39.456 --> 35:41.850
There's a lot to think
about, isn't there?

35:42.363 --> 35:43.697
Yeah.

35:46.385 --> 35:48.606
I wanted to give you this.

35:58.877 --> 36:00.239
What is it?

36:00.553 --> 36:03.370
That is my old anatomy
book from college.

36:03.765 --> 36:05.374
It brought me a lot of luck so hopefully

36:05.399 --> 36:08.041
it will bring you some good luck too.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.963
Oh, Carson.

36:13.581 --> 36:16.133
I haven't even decided
if I'm going to go yet.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.803

where the right decision
is to take the risk.

36:32.182 --> 36:34.902
And this is one of
those times, isn't it?

36:37.673 --> 36:39.072
It is.

36:48.411 --> 36:49.878
You'll visit?

36:49.944 --> 36:51.960
Of course I will.

36:52.759 --> 36:55.173
I'm going to Chicago in a week!

37:00.280 --> 37:02.638
- Good day, Ned.
- Good day.

37:03.353 --> 37:04.973
Hello Elizabeth.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.404
Hi Lucas!

37:07.592 --> 37:08.929
Uh-oh.

37:08.954 --> 37:11.188
And hello, young man.

37:18.826 --> 37:20.614
What are you looking for?

37:21.260 --> 37:22.909
Humble pie.

37:23.181 --> 37:25.744
I am hoping Ned has some in stock.

37:26.427 --> 37:28.705
You finished reading the chapters.

37:29.108 --> 37:30.507
I did.

37:30.576 --> 37:32.309
And what did you think?

37:32.407 --> 37:36.270
Well, Luther, aside from being a
handsome charming restauranteur,

37:36.295 --> 37:38.006
who enjoys a game of cards

37:38.544 --> 37:41.843
is also a widower with a young daughter

37:42.470 --> 37:44.472
and he once worked as a Pinkerton.

37:44.992 --> 37:47.015
A man of many talents.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.265
Indeed.

37:48.380 --> 37:49.810
I'll remember.

37:53.622 --> 37:55.607
It is just fiction.

38:05.861 --> 38:07.786
[KNOCKING]

38:09.176 --> 38:10.576
Slow day?

38:10.601 --> 38:13.500
Don't let this book fool you.

38:13.773 --> 38:15.506
Here are your doo-hickeys.

38:15.531 --> 38:17.165
Great. How much will it be?

38:17.190 --> 38:19.382
$3.20.

38:21.345 --> 38:23.719
So I heard you're going
to be a bridesmaid.

38:24.130 --> 38:25.680
That's right.

38:25.705 --> 38:27.889
Did you know I am going
to be a groomsman?

38:28.477 --> 38:30.226
Clara mentioned it.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.562
You know I've never
been a groomsman before

38:32.587 --> 38:35.231
so I'm not exactly sure as to
what it is to be expected.

38:35.793 --> 38:38.151
Have you ever stood around before?

38:38.575 --> 38:39.943
Yeah.

38:39.968 --> 38:41.448
Then you will do great.

38:41.473 --> 38:43.401
[LAUGHS]

38:43.426 --> 38:45.449
There you go.

38:46.188 --> 38:48.118
Thanks.

38:58.056 --> 38:59.313
Bill?

38:59.338 --> 39:01.841
Hey, I found the perfect
recipe for a wedding cake!

39:01.969 --> 39:03.969
Lucas is handling the cake.

39:04.118 --> 39:06.079
Lucas! He can't bake!

39:06.104 --> 39:07.711
He's using Gustave.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.922
- Oh, yeah, Gustave.
- Bill.

39:09.947 --> 39:11.336
Well, let me handle the food then?

39:11.361 --> 39:12.969
Lucas is handling all of the food.

39:12.994 --> 39:14.593
But why him? I'll do it for free.

39:14.618 --> 39:17.418
Bill! You are going to be far too busy.

39:17.443 --> 39:19.107
Well, how's that?

39:19.694 --> 39:22.319
Because you're going to be
walking me down the aisle.

39:24.659 --> 39:27.292
You're the closest thing
that I have to a father.

39:27.317 --> 39:29.117
[TEARS UP]

39:32.271 --> 39:36.584
Say yes, so that I can
cross it off my list.

39:54.660 --> 39:58.657
Ah, I should make my move
while there is still light.

39:58.682 --> 40:00.849
You don't have to leave so soon.

40:00.874 --> 40:03.069
I wish I could stay, sweetheart.

40:03.094 --> 40:06.238
But a friend of mine is holding
a job for me up north.

40:06.414 --> 40:10.408
It's time for grandpa to make
a better life for himself.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.886
I'm glad you came.

40:12.989 --> 40:15.330
So am I, sweetheart.

40:15.779 --> 40:17.791
I have something for you.

40:17.943 --> 40:19.745
I had some time last night

40:19.770 --> 40:23.004
and I know how you love
stories about your mom,

40:23.379 --> 40:25.841
so I wrote a few.

40:26.709 --> 40:28.347
I'll send more, if you want.

40:28.372 --> 40:30.388
You promise.

40:33.353 --> 40:35.017
I promise.

40:41.543 --> 40:43.191
<i>We'll stay in touch.</i>

40:48.336 --> 40:50.493
Oh, I made you a sandwich.

40:51.348 --> 40:53.081
Thank you, sweetheart.

40:53.106 --> 40:55.078
Why don't you put that in my saddle bag.

40:55.734 --> 40:59.041
Take it easy on your uncle.

40:59.377 --> 41:01.418
He loves you very much.

41:01.617 --> 41:03.629
You know that, right?

41:03.795 --> 41:06.631
Yeah, I know.

41:07.260 --> 41:10.677
Well, it was good to see ya.

41:11.032 --> 41:15.276
Hopefully the next time it will
be in different circumstances.

41:15.748 --> 41:17.852
Take care of yourself.

41:18.486 --> 41:20.052
Hey, Dad...

41:22.785 --> 41:25.852
I just want to say that I'm sorry...
for everything.

41:25.877 --> 41:30.781
You don't ever have to
apologize to me, son.

41:43.629 --> 41:45.970
Come on, let's go.

41:57.490 --> 41:59.142
Are we okay?

41:59.432 --> 42:01.812
Yeah, we're good.

42:02.012 --> 42:03.481
Good.

42:03.674 --> 42:05.732
Oh, come on, let's go home then.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.228
Unless of course you
want to spend the night

42:08.253 --> 42:10.035
at Mrs. Thornton's.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.792
Nah. She's great,

42:11.817 --> 42:14.410
but little Jack, he's got some lungs.

42:14.435 --> 42:15.825
[LAUGHS]

42:15.850 --> 42:17.953
Thank you.
