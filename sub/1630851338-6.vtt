10:47.080 --> 10:51.282
He was stabbing her
and she was fighting him.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.484
Murdoch:
She was still alive?

10:56.690 --> 10:57.822
Yes.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.857
Murdoch:
What did you do?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.497
Nothing.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.964
I couldn't move.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.999
I swear I wanted to.
I couldn't move.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.037
Murdoch: You watched
as she was being murdered

11:13.106 --> 11:14.305
And you did nothing?

11:19.579 --> 11:22.513
You then cut your own arm
with an ordinary kitchen knife

11:22.549 --> 11:25.516
To bolster your fabricated
story of heroics.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.419
Yes.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.053
I'm a coward.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.122
I'm nothing
but a coward.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.327
Did the attacker see you?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.464
Yes.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.402
He looked right at me.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.738
I thought I was going
to die, but then...

11:49.008 --> 11:49.974
He left.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.181
Murdoch: The boy seems to
be telling the truth now.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.250
But why would
the killer let him live?

12:01.154 --> 12:03.021
Ogden: Perhaps so he could
tell of what happened?

12:03.156 --> 12:06.224
To perpetuate
the legend of the clown?

12:06.226 --> 12:09.093
What are you doing back there?
Why can't I come in?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.096
It's a surprise!

12:12.899 --> 12:15.099
Whoever this clown is,
he seems to be motivated

12:15.102 --> 12:16.968
By puritanical beliefs.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.570
The flyer
and the photograph

12:19.606 --> 12:22.841
Were meant to instill
fear and shame.

12:22.976 --> 12:26.778
Perhaps the motive
for the murder is the same?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.646
Ogden: Well, strong
religious convictions

12:28.648 --> 12:31.249
Can motivate extreme acts.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.717
Perhaps he believes

12:33.754 --> 12:36.387
He's saving these
students from damnation?

12:36.456 --> 12:39.257
But to kill?

12:39.259 --> 12:43.595
To commit such an act
of evil himself.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.729
Ogden:
It seems irrational to us, yes,

12:45.766 --> 12:49.066
But perhaps not to him.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.468
I'm only glad he wasn't
around when I was at school.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.207
So, what do you think?

12:56.209 --> 12:59.210
You're wearing that
to the party tonight?

12:59.279 --> 13:03.014
Well, yes, I'll wear whatever
I please to the party tonight.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.617
Well, yeah.
It's-it's just that, uh...

13:07.754 --> 13:11.222
Aren't costumes meant
to be frightening?

13:11.291 --> 13:14.959
Yes, but frightening
costumes are so unattractive.

13:15.094 --> 13:18.029
I just, I thought I'd
try something more fun.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.164
You're a witch.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.033
A seductive witch.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.435
Now it's time
for your costume.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.039
Don't be afraid!
It's not as tight as it looks.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.340
Murdoch:
Ouch!

13:29.342 --> 13:30.774
Leigh?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.447
Leigh,

-Hello, gentlemen.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.864
We received a call
about a disturbance.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.866
Miss cherry, might I ask
what you're doing here?

15:02.001 --> 15:04.602
Cherry: Don't worry.
I didn't touch a thing.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.205
After you refused to give me any
information about the murder,

15:07.340 --> 15:08.873
I decided to revisit
my old sources

15:08.942 --> 15:11.141
From last year's
clown incidents.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.844
This young man
was one of your sources?

15:13.880 --> 15:16.547
Cherry: No. I believe
this is donovan kent.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.882
He was the sweetheart
of the poor girl

15:18.017 --> 15:19.750
Who killed herself
last year.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.118
This is her house.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.886
She and her sister
were two of my sources.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.088
So, he doesn't
live here?

15:24.223 --> 15:26.290
No.
I don't know why he's here.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.125
Is there anyone
else in the house?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.693
I don't believe so.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.364
Two brandy glasses.

15:33.499 --> 15:34.832
George, have a look around.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.968
See if anyone left
in any sort of hurry.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.235
Sir.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.907
Miss cherry, how did
you come to be inside?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.511
I noticed from the road
that the door was ajar.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.380
Then I heard someone,
a man's voice,

15:49.416 --> 15:52.183
Say, "it's you."

15:52.252 --> 15:55.019
As if he recognized
the killer?

15:55.021 --> 15:58.723
Then I heard a scream
and by the time I was inside,

15:58.792 --> 16:01.158
The clown was fleeing
through the back door.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.131
My guess is it's
a fellow student,

16:07.266 --> 16:09.133
Perhaps another
member of the lit.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.142
Whoever it was seems
to have lost a shoe.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.054
Hello?

16:36.295 --> 16:38.796
Hello?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.099
Is there
somebody in there?

16:54.380 --> 16:56.213
[both scream]

16:56.249 --> 16:58.349
Oh!

16:58.351 --> 16:59.584
Don't hurt me.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.652
Toronto constabulary!

17:01.721 --> 17:03.321
Don't move.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.622
What are you
doing in there?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.591
-Hiding!
-Why?

17:07.627 --> 17:08.860
Why do you think?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.995
This is my house.

17:17.971 --> 17:19.670
I heard a scream.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.740
I came in from
the kitchen and I saw...

17:23.843 --> 17:25.943
The clown...

17:26.012 --> 17:27.812
The knife,
the blood.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.548
I think donovan
was already dead.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.484
And what did you do?

17:33.619 --> 17:36.020
I ran and I hid
in the closet.

17:36.022 --> 17:39.090
Were your parents
not at home?

17:39.225 --> 17:42.126
They're visiting my aunt
in st. Catharines.

17:43.530 --> 17:47.164
I'm sorry to bring this up,
miss iverson, but, uh...

17:49.502 --> 17:50.835
Is this your sister?

17:50.970 --> 17:54.104
Heather. Yes.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.775
Murdoch:
She took her own life?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.576
Last year.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.245
I'm so sorry.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.114
What happened?

18:03.249 --> 18:04.915
That happened.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.188
She committed suicide
because of the shame

18:11.224 --> 18:14.292
That was brought
upon her?

18:14.427 --> 18:17.795
Who is the boy
in the photo?

18:17.797 --> 18:19.797
Donovan.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.068
The same young man
who was killed in your home?

18:24.070 --> 18:25.670
Well, yes, but...

18:25.805 --> 18:27.004
It had nothing to
do with heather.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.074
And donovan was so
distraught after she...

18:32.078 --> 18:34.912
It was our grief
that brought us together.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.180
You were sweethearts?

18:42.689 --> 18:45.623
Could one of your classmates
be responsible for this?

18:45.758 --> 18:48.359
For killing him?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.428
No.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.365
You haven't noticed anyone
acting strangely at school?

18:54.434 --> 18:57.034
I hadn't noticed
anything, but...

18:57.170 --> 18:59.370
But the costume,

18:59.505 --> 19:01.372
I think I've seen
the costume before.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.073
Where?

19:03.143 --> 19:05.409
I believe it was
in a school play.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.787
Something the matter,
detective?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.855
Yes. Look at these.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.591
The jack-o-lanterns?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.126
They look quite nice.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.994
Indeed.
Precisely.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.797
Every melon-fisted constable
in the stationhouse

19:26.833 --> 19:28.599
Has a defter
touch than I.

19:31.404 --> 19:35.206
I'm afraid it is time for me
to bow out of my own contest.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.140
-A contest?
-Indeed.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.143
Care to participate?

19:39.145 --> 19:40.744
Perhaps I'll try my hand.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.680
I'm rather good
with a knife.

19:42.815 --> 19:43.748
Watts:
Ah.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.017
The shoe we found at the scene
of the second murder

19:47.053 --> 19:48.552
Is a match for the bloody
footprint we found

19:48.588 --> 19:50.221
At the scene of the first.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.489
Isn't it obvious?
It's a killer clown, murdoch.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.491
What have you
got there, sir?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.693
Pumpkin seeds.
I've told you, crabtree.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.562
Margaret's been
roasting them.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.165
The only good thing to come out
of this all hallow's nonsense.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.435
Now, then,
my next question is:

20:05.471 --> 20:08.305
Why were these children all home
alone without chaperones?

20:08.341 --> 20:09.773
Teeners, sir.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.975
What?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.777
They are not children,
not yet adults.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.645
They're teeners.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.715
The parents in both of
the instances were out of town.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.318
We're working on
contacting them now.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.920
Any thoughts on as to why
they were being targeted?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.488
-They're a bit fibrous.
-Eh?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.457
The pumpkin seeds, sir.
They're a bit fibrous.

20:26.592 --> 20:27.791
They could use
some flavour.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.127
They're salted.
That's flavour enough.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.529
Right, murdoch?

20:31.664 --> 20:35.399
The killer seems to be acting on
the same puritanical motive

20:35.401 --> 20:37.668
That drove him to
stalk and photograph

20:37.803 --> 20:40.337
This same group
of students last year.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.206
And now he's
graduated to murder.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.141
Indeed. Although
I have no explanation

20:44.143 --> 20:46.810
As to why he only killed
one of the victims

20:46.846 --> 20:48.412
In each of the attacks.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.014
One boy and one girl.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.816
And nothing that links them
to the two that were killed?

20:52.852 --> 20:54.018
Murdoch:
Not as yet.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.953
And all the students were
members of the same club?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.955
The lit, sir.
An academic society.

20:58.992 --> 21:01.092
Well, let's get a list
of the membership.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.093
And we'll station
a constable at the house

21:03.162 --> 21:05.830
Of anyone we think was up
to a bit of how's your father?

21:05.832 --> 21:07.230
Sir, what's on these ones?

21:07.267 --> 21:08.799
That's the ruined batch.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.268
Margaret was making
a pumpkin pie.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.303
She spilled spices
all over that lot.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.773
Ooh. Nutmeg!

21:15.775 --> 21:16.974
Sir, I think
they're fantastic.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.477
They're bloody awful
is what they are, crabtree.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.212
Now, how do we catch
this clown, murdoch?

21:22.248 --> 21:24.047
Well, I do have one idea.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.982
Miss iverson gave me
the name of a young lady

21:26.019 --> 21:28.652
Who is the president of
the drama club at the school.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.987
Perhaps she knows something
about this costume?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.996
Thank you, miss porter.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.264
Brackenreid:
Head of the drama club, are you?

21:40.399 --> 21:42.800
-Yes.
-Very good.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.535
Miss porter,
did any of your shows

21:44.670 --> 21:47.271
Employ the use
of a clown costume?

21:47.406 --> 21:49.807
Ah, yes. We did pagliacci
about two years ago.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.743
Oh.
Where might we find those?

21:52.878 --> 21:54.278
I'm not sure.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.080
Uh, but the costumes
from each show

21:56.082 --> 21:59.015
Should be organized together
and every hanger's labelled.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.955
Did you know the deceased?
Mr. Kent and miss robbins?

22:04.957 --> 22:07.625
A little.
We were all in the lit together.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.694
So, you know what happened
last fall, at Halloween.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.097
Did you see the clown?

22:13.166 --> 22:15.499
No. I'm not that kind of girl.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.101
Brackenreid:
What kind of girl?

22:17.170 --> 22:19.503
The kind of girl the clown would
need to be taking pictures of.

22:19.638 --> 22:22.506
Meaning you don't
spend time with boys?

22:22.641 --> 22:25.376
Perhaps with a chaperone,
not like those other girls.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.044
Do you agree with
what the clown did?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.979
Taking those photos
and showing them round?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.948
Sure. We all did.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.850
Somebody had
to do something.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.786
Heather iverson,
the girl who killed herself.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.189
She was running around
with boys like some jezebel.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.524
It's no small wonder
she lost all her friends.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.526
And what of the boy
in the photo, mr. Kent?

22:42.562 --> 22:44.595
Did he receive
the same treatment?

22:44.730 --> 22:46.163
Well, there were
rumours it was him,

22:46.232 --> 22:47.998
But nobody cares
what boys do.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.867
I'm not so sure that's
true, miss porter.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.268
Brackenreid:
'course it is, murdoch.

22:51.304 --> 22:53.336
When I was a young man,
I got away with bloody murder.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.039
Metaphorically,
of course.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.640
Well, that may be so,
sir, but, in this case,

22:56.776 --> 23:00.010
Someone cared enough about what
mr. Kent was up to to kill him.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.146
Ah, here we are, murdoch.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.347
Colombina...

23:03.349 --> 23:04.615
Taddeo...
Pagliacci.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.021
Miss porter, who else
has access to this room?

23:11.023 --> 23:12.656
The drama teacher,
mr. Douglas.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.425
He's the faculty member
who presides over the lit.

23:15.461 --> 23:18.762
Sir! Mr. Douglas
is nowhere to be found.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.363
He may be on the run.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.765
We don't know
that yet, george.

23:21.768 --> 23:22.833
Well, sir, we found these.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.703
Murdoch: That's
the picture from the flyer.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.038
Crabtree:
And there's more, sir.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.773
He has a set up in there,
much like you do in your office

23:29.809 --> 23:31.976
With the one red light,
but otherwise the room is dark.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.711
-A...
-Darkroom.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.379
Uh, that's it.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.983
It's him, george.
He's the clown.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.784
We have to notify
the public.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.320
I'll get a description out
to the inspector and the lads.

23:43.389 --> 23:47.257
It seems we'll be working
late tonight, george.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.393
I'll have to notify julia

23:49.528 --> 23:51.262
That I won't be able to attend

23:51.264 --> 23:54.798
The neighbours' fancy
costume party.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.399
You hardly seem
disappointed, sir.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.601
I am not.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.070
Crabtree:
Stay home?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.739
Sir, isn't the clown
killing people in their homes?

24:02.809 --> 24:05.009
Only when the parents
are out gallivanting.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.143
Yes, well, I think your
directive may have been

24:07.180 --> 24:09.212
Issued too late,
inspector.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.413
Brackenreid:
Eh?

24:10.450 --> 24:12.016
We just received a report
of a group of youngsters

24:12.018 --> 24:14.284
Causing a disturbance
down on queen street.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.620
Halloween gets
worse every year.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.657
Get to work on checking
those fingermarks, crabtree.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.158
When we find douglas,
I want him to swing for this.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.994
Sir.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.167
Well, good night, george.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.835
Night, henry.
Happy Halloween.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.970
Any plans?

24:33.105 --> 24:34.371
I think ruthie
wants to take jordan

24:34.373 --> 24:35.572
To ask for tricks and treats.

24:35.608 --> 24:36.907
You?

24:36.943 --> 24:39.643
Uh, I'm going to match
fingermarks on this shoe

24:39.778 --> 24:42.179
To those of mr. Douglas
we obtained in his home.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.648
-Festive.
-Indeed.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.784
Ah, try not to be murdered
by a killer clown.

25:08.207 --> 25:12.276

25:12.411 --> 25:13.610

Thank you, doctor.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.048
I'm sure I'm more
shaken than hurt.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.851
I only hope I never see
another clown as long as I live.

27:00.920 --> 27:05.055
I can't imagine why the killer
would target you, george.

27:05.190 --> 27:08.125
Until now, he's been focused
on a small group of students.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.960
Sir, I haven't
the faintest.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.128
He still went
through the trouble

27:11.197 --> 27:12.662
Of making the phone call.

27:12.698 --> 27:14.798
Just like the
other victims.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.933
How did you manage to
fight him off, george?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.068
Well, it was strange.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.604
There was a moment he
had me flat on my back.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.940
I swear he could have
killed me and then...

27:23.075 --> 27:25.142
He hesitated.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.677
He let you live.

27:26.679 --> 27:27.878
I think so, sir.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.946
It was just for a moment,
but I took advantage of it.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.982
I put a boot into him
and he ran off.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.687
Well, if he didn't
want to kill you...

27:36.822 --> 27:38.755
Sir?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.124
There you are.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.159
Oh. Thank you, doctor.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.494
I'm sorry all this
has interfered

27:43.496 --> 27:44.894
With your fancy dress party.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.930
-Oh.
-George.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.766
The shoe. It's gone.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.168
Oh, no.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.202
That was the only
piece of evidence

27:52.238 --> 27:54.104
That would tie the killer
to the murders.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.573
Sir, I found fingermarks
on the shoe,

27:56.575 --> 27:59.710
But I'd not yet compared
them to mr. Douglas.

27:59.712 --> 28:02.312
He knew you had
the evidence to hang him.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.180
He came back
to steal it.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.782
We have to stop him
before he strikes again.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.321
All right, then, you lot!

28:11.323 --> 28:12.656
Clear off all you
bloody crackpots.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.424
Let the dogs
see the rabbit.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.795
Ah, inspector!

28:19.331 --> 28:21.264
Are you all right?

28:23.902 --> 28:25.635
Is this some kind
of trick-or-treat prank?

28:25.671 --> 28:27.538
No, it's not a damn prank!

28:27.540 --> 28:29.206
We're with the police.
We're here to help.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.674
What happened?

28:30.676 --> 28:32.609
-I was kidnapped.
-By whom?

28:32.678 --> 28:34.945
Someone dressed
as a clown.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.947
What's your name, sir?

28:37.082 --> 28:38.682
Roger douglas.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.484
Is that right?

28:40.486 --> 28:42.886
We've been looking
for you, mr. Douglas.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.690
It happened
two nights ago.

28:46.825 --> 28:50.694
I was home alone
and suddenly I felt

28:50.829 --> 28:52.763
Like someone
was watching me.

28:52.765 --> 28:56.432
I heard a sound in the next
room so I went to look,

28:56.469 --> 28:58.368
But no one
was there.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.170
I turned 'round and...

29:02.174 --> 29:04.241
-Someone hit you?
-Knocked me right out.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.511
-Did you see who it was?
-I saw the costume.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.780
-Pagliacci.
-The clown.

29:09.782 --> 29:13.883
Next thing I knew, I was waking
up in a room with no windows.

29:13.885 --> 29:14.918
Tied up.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.353
Were you alone?

29:16.422 --> 29:18.321
He came to check on me
a couple of times,

29:18.390 --> 29:20.456
Fed me
some bread and milk.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.359
And you managed to escape.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.561
I worked my feet
free from the ropes.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.797
I was able to get close enough
to the door to kick it open.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.533
From there I went
up a few stairs

29:29.602 --> 29:31.401
And stumbled out
into the street.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.870
That's when you found me.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.806
Convenient this clown didn't
know much about tying ropes.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.207
Douglas:
What do you mean?

29:37.342 --> 29:39.476
Well, my men
found the place

29:39.478 --> 29:40.944
That you said you
were being held

29:40.946 --> 29:42.346
And there was
nothing there.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.281
Murdoch:
No evidence of another party.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.883
Another party?

29:45.885 --> 29:48.418
The clown, douglas.
No sign of him.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.053
What are you...

29:50.055 --> 29:51.721
You think
I kidnapped myself?

29:54.593 --> 29:57.293
We know that you are
the clown, mr. Douglas.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.563
We found these
in your home.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.065
Along with more photos
of other students.

30:02.067 --> 30:06.170
Yes, I took these.
Last year.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.638
You dressed up
and terrorized the kids?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.140
Terrorized?

30:10.209 --> 30:11.975
I was warning them.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.377
You wouldn't believe
the things they do.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.378
One of them had to leave
school because she was...

30:15.447 --> 30:17.581
She had it
taken care of.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.851
What do you think
will happen to her soul?

30:20.853 --> 30:23.186
I am doing the work
of the lord.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.189
To keep them
from a life of sin,

30:25.324 --> 30:28.025
You decided they should
have no life at all.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.192
What?

30:29.261 --> 30:31.394
Irene robbins
and donovan kent.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.529
What about them?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.264
They're dead,
mr. Douglas.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.467
You donned your clown costume
and stabbed them to death.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.137
No. No!

30:40.272 --> 30:42.339
No, I had nothing
to do with this.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.539
I swear!

30:43.576 --> 30:44.942
Don't you see?

30:45.077 --> 30:47.143
It's whoever
kidnapped me.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.946
Everything I did, I did
out of love for my students.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.082
Someone else
has the costume.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.683
Someone else
is doing this.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.419
A second clown?

30:55.421 --> 30:57.821
Excuse us if we
remain skeptical.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.156
I swear to you, I...

30:59.291 --> 31:00.490
I have no idea
what is going on.

31:00.626 --> 31:03.827
I did not kill anyone.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.330
Detective!

31:07.366 --> 31:08.966
Is detective murdoch
still in?

31:09.101 --> 31:10.166
No, miss cherry.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.568
He's very busy with
the drama teacher fellow

31:11.703 --> 31:14.837
And all that nasty
killer-clown business.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.572
Would you
like some pie?

31:16.609 --> 31:17.908
The drama teacher.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.009
From jarvis collegiate?

31:19.078 --> 31:20.377
Hm.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.245
He's the one that
oversees the lit.

31:22.314 --> 31:23.713
Yes, yes.
No, no, no!

31:23.749 --> 31:25.649
I was not supposed
to tell you that.

31:25.784 --> 31:26.983
Don't worry about it.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.251
But you won't print it.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.786
'course I'll print it.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.393
Tiring day, detective?

31:36.528 --> 31:38.261
Something like that.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.196
Perhaps this will
raise your spirits.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.133
My, my.

31:43.135 --> 31:46.136
Look at the detail.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.271
Ah, you sort of
scratched...

31:48.307 --> 31:51.541
-Uh! Is that?
-A self-portrait. Yes.

31:51.677 --> 31:55.145
Well, let's leave
it with the others

31:55.214 --> 31:58.014
And I'm sure you'll be awarded
first prize in the morning.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.816
Congratulations,
mrs. Hart.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.486
Hmm.

32:03.555 --> 32:06.089
-Do you believe him?
-Of course not.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.557
He knew we were after him,
so he came up with

32:07.559 --> 32:09.826
This kidnapping stunt
to give himself an alibi.

32:09.862 --> 32:11.828
Right after he
stole the shoe.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.563
The one piece of evidence
that could have tied him

32:13.565 --> 32:15.565
To at least one
of the murders.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.168
Sir, I was moments away
from confirming the fingermarks

32:18.303 --> 32:19.703
On the shoe were his.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.905
Precisely.
Too bloody convenient.

32:21.974 --> 32:24.508
So, it's your theory
against his word.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.443
An all-too-familiar
scenario.

Yes.
I'm awfully scared.

You'll be happy to know we

32:53.539 --> 32:55.672
How do you know who's
behind that mask?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.674
If it will make
you feel better,

32:57.743 --> 33:00.810
You could always stay here,
in the cells.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.879

33:02.881 --> 33:05.749

in the city.

Is miss cherry all right?

34:07.146 --> 34:09.679
Mrs. Hart happened along
and the clown ran off.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.281
So, this means that douglas
is not the killer.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.017
So, he really
was kidnapped?

34:14.152 --> 34:17.019
Presumably to frame him
for the murders.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.455
So, who is it then?

34:18.457 --> 34:20.323
And why did they want
to kill miss cherry?

34:20.325 --> 34:21.791
Well, sir, we assumed
that the motive

34:21.860 --> 34:24.294
Was to stop the students from
engaging in carnal activity,

34:24.429 --> 34:26.296
But that
no longer holds.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.431
Sirs, what
if the motivation

34:28.434 --> 34:29.966
Wasn't about
the carnal activity,

34:30.035 --> 34:32.502
But the response to it?

34:32.504 --> 34:33.636
The shaming.

34:36.442 --> 34:39.276
Andrea porter did state
that heather iverson

34:39.411 --> 34:42.913
Didn't kill herself only because
of the clown's photograph.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.916
Also because of how her fellow
students shamed her for it.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.518
Right. And two of our victims
are amongst those students,

34:48.520 --> 34:49.719
The ones who
did the shaming.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.788
And perhaps perry balfour
was left alive

34:51.857 --> 34:53.523
Because he was
new to the school.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.825
Whereas miss cherry went off
and published an article

34:55.861 --> 34:57.928
That wasn't so much
about the clown,

34:57.930 --> 35:00.329
But about the promiscuity
of the teeners.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.866
Teeners?
Not you, as well, crabtree!

35:02.868 --> 35:04.634
Sir, I'm just trying to
keep up with the times.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.536
That could be why
miss cherry was targeted.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.806
Perhaps the anonymous tip
that she received

35:09.808 --> 35:11.942
About the first murder came
from the killer himself

35:12.077 --> 35:13.743
In order to draw her in.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.211
But why would he want to
kill you two bugalugs?

35:15.247 --> 35:17.146
But, sir, he didn't.
He didn't come for me.

35:17.182 --> 35:18.414
He came for the shoe.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.483
We assume that mr. Douglas
stole the evidence

35:20.486 --> 35:22.085
In order to keep us
from discovering

35:22.087 --> 35:23.753
That he was the killer,
when in fact

35:23.755 --> 35:25.555
It was the killer
who stole the evidence

35:25.591 --> 35:27.157
In order to keep us
from discovering

35:27.226 --> 35:29.893
That mr. Douglas
was not the killer.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.194
All right.

35:31.263 --> 35:34.364
So someone's killing everyone
who shamed that poor girl.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.966
Who is it?

this is happening.

stop fooling around with boys?
