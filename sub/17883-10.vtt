WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.267
You suck.
No, you suck.

00:02.269 --> 00:04.303
No, you suck.
No, you do.

00:04.305 --> 00:06.638
Uh, no, you do.
I don't.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.773
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.

00:07.775 --> 00:08.640
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.175
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.443
Trouble with
the fake wifey?

00:11.445 --> 00:12.978
Oh. Of all the women
who needed a Green Card,

00:12.980 --> 00:15.147
I end up with a stuffy,
anal-retentive Brit...

00:15.149 --> 00:16.615
Who freaks out
every time

00:16.617 --> 00:17.750
I leave
the toilet seat up!

00:17.752 --> 00:18.917
I don't care
that it's up!

00:18.919 --> 00:21.653
Just try to hit the bowl,
you Neanderthal!

00:21.655 --> 00:22.921
See what
I'm dealing with?

00:22.923 --> 00:24.456
The only thing keeping me sane
is Molly Kong.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.225
What's Molly Kong?
A little game I invented.

00:26.227 --> 00:30.696
Every time Molly flips out
over something stupid, I score points.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.998
Could you please
close the cabinets?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.800
It's like I... I can track

00:34.802 --> 00:35.968
your progress
around the kitchen.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.404
Oh, look. You got
a little bowl from here...

00:38.406 --> 00:39.905
And then you got
your cereal,

00:39.907 --> 00:41.473
which is probably
now stale.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.875
Then you went
to the drawer

00:42.877 --> 00:44.977
and got yourself a little spoon,
didn't you?

00:44.979 --> 00:46.178
And then you went
in the fridge

00:46.180 --> 00:47.413
to get some milk
and... Oh, my God!

00:47.415 --> 00:50.949
Will you stop putting back
the empty containers?

00:51.652 --> 00:54.153
Pick that up!

00:54.888 --> 00:56.755
50 points.

00:56.757 --> 00:57.723
You live like a pig, dude.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.425
I'm siding with Molly
on this one.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.492
Oh, come on,
you're just saying that

01:00.494 --> 01:01.794
'cause you have
a crazy crush on her.

01:01.796 --> 01:04.496
Yeah, that might be a factor
in my decision, yes.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.398
Dude, what are you wearing?
It's 80 degrees outside.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.234
Oz is about to close
a huge deal with a client.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.670
He told me to dress
to impress.

01:15.809 --> 01:16.608
I'm sure this is my bad.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.277
I probably could've been
more specific.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.078
Hey, what's
more impressive

01:19.080 --> 01:22.047
than a domesticated Tauntaun
from the ice planet Hoth?

01:22.049 --> 01:23.582
I don't know.
A suit and tie?

01:23.584 --> 01:27.219
Here comes the limo.
Just let me do the talking.

01:32.358 --> 01:32.891
There he is.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.594
Tony Hawk, the Bird Man,
welcome to Contra.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.528
How was the ride over?

01:36.530 --> 01:39.731
Bumpy.
That's a sweet Tauntaun.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.100
Told ya.

01:41.102 --> 01:44.470
Come on, Tony.
Let's kick it.

01:46.539 --> 01:47.539
Okay, Tony, we are gonna
hook you up

01:47.541 --> 01:49.408
with top-notch security
for your whole operation.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.544
We're talking retail,
video games, skate parks,

01:52.546 --> 01:54.146
your entire
billion-dollar empire.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.181
Now where should we start?
In my house.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.183
It's been a nightmare ever since
I drained the pool.

01:58.185 --> 02:01.053
Stop skating in my pool,
you punks!

02:01.055 --> 02:03.288
Up yours, old man!

02:03.690 --> 02:04.490
Well, you're in
great hands.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.525
I'll make sure we cross every "t"
and gleam every cube.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.360
Okay, you know
"gleaming the cube"

02:08.362 --> 02:09.294
doesn't mean anything,
right?

02:09.296 --> 02:12.331
Well, neither does
half the crap I say.

02:12.432 --> 02:15.267
Oz! Oz! we've got
an emergency.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.435
I just got a call
from Corporate!

02:16.437 --> 02:18.103
Heather O'Brien is gonna
be here any minute.

02:18.105 --> 02:21.440
She's the senior V.P.
of multi-platform digital media.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.608
What does that even mean?
I don't know,

02:22.610 --> 02:25.844
but I do know that if this place
doesn't look like a million bucks,

02:25.846 --> 02:27.980
she is gonna have my head
on a platter.

02:27.982 --> 02:32.017
We need pops of color,
brighter lights, more attractive people!

02:32.019 --> 02:32.751
What?
Uh...

02:32.753 --> 02:35.387
Oh, mail cart guy?
Oh, I.T. persons?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.755
Guess what? Good news...

02:36.757 --> 02:39.525
You get the rest of the week off,
you handsome devils!

02:39.527 --> 02:41.994
Get out.
Whoa! Leggo my uggos.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.061
Everybody get back
to work.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.296
We're not getting rid
of anybody.

02:44.298 --> 02:50.302
Oswald, Heather O'Brien is the
most black-hearted, soul-sucking,

02:50.304 --> 02:53.472
vicious,
life-ruining succubus

02:53.474 --> 02:54.840
who ever dragged
her talons

02:54.842 --> 02:58.110
across this beautiful,
big, green marble.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.479
Hi. I'm looking for Oz.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.880
You and three
deposed dictators.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.950
I am he.
Welcome to Master Control.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.118
You must be Heather.
Wow.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.452
I'd heard you were
a man of mystery,

03:07.454 --> 03:10.722
but, uh, they didn't tell me
how handsome you were.

03:11.057 --> 03:11.924
Careful, Oz.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.926
Remember what Vee said.
Yeah.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.460
Dinobots. Cool.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.296
A lot of people think
that's where  <i>Transformers</i>

03:17.298 --> 03:19.264
jumped the shark,
but I disagree.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.699
It was totally Unicron.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.366
Totally.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.435
- Wow.
- She is awesome.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.736
Oh, there's my assistant.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.837
She's gonna be
passing out a gift

03:25.839 --> 03:29.308
as a token of my appreciation
for you putting up with us.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.709
How nice.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.478
A 2009 Donn Shaw?

03:33.480 --> 03:35.280
That's my favorite
Riesling.

03:35.282 --> 03:35.847
Oh.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.483
Check it out.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.351
Psst!

03:39.353 --> 03:42.854
Cawk-Oz! Cawk-Oz! Cawk-Oz!

03:42.856 --> 03:45.257
Oh. Was I right or what?

03:45.259 --> 03:46.658
I mean,
is she heinous?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.427
Oh, yeah, she's, uh...

03:48.429 --> 03:49.795
She's a real monster.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.362
Okay.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.231
Wish me luck.
I'm going in.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.632
Hey, girl. What up?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.268
Wow.
Did you lose weight?

03:56.270 --> 03:58.437
'Cause you look
phenoma-balls.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.005
Veronica.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.275
I thought I smelled
cheap weed and desperation.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.778
I'm kidding!

04:06.780 --> 04:08.046
Oh.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.115
This is
my assistant Heather.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.383
What? Same name?

04:11.385 --> 04:13.185
Well, birds of
a Heather, I guess.

04:13.187 --> 04:14.353
Oh, why did I say that?

04:14.355 --> 04:17.723
Because you are the worst.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.223
Yeah.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.359
I'm kidding.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.560
Oh.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.097
I'm gonna pass out.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.766
I can't breathe.

04:27.768 --> 04:31.203
Contra Edition.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.237
Yeah!
I am here

04:32.239 --> 04:34.239
to rebrand your company
and make it a household name.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.674
Well, here's
the skinny, Heather...

04:35.676 --> 04:38.243
A good security company likes
to keep an air of mystery.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.911
Ah, and I respect
that point, Oz,

04:39.913 --> 04:43.448
but judging by your web page,
a little too mysterious.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.418
Yeah, I Googled "Contra,"
and all that comes up

04:46.420 --> 04:50.622
is some Nintendo game
that's, like, older than me.

04:50.923 --> 04:52.491
With all due respect,
Oswald,

04:52.493 --> 04:55.661
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with
the Heathers on this one.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.964
Yeah. Tap into the future.
Get on that Internet.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.800
Yes, where everybody
blogs about food

05:01.802 --> 05:04.970
and all relationships
are ruined by pornography.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.939
Listen, I'm just here to shoot
some video around the office

05:07.941 --> 05:10.575
and make
an online company brochure.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.010
One teeny snag.

05:12.012 --> 05:17.616
Oswald here really,
really doesn't like to be on camera.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.490
Well... If we can't use a pretty face

05:25.492 --> 05:27.993
to represent the company,
then I guess I could pick,

05:27.995 --> 05:32.064
as an absolute, gun-to-my-head
last resort...

05:32.066 --> 05:33.865
Veronica.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.567
Oh, wait.
She's kidding.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.805
Ka-blam! With the zingers
all day long, this one. Right?

05:39.807 --> 05:40.472
No. I'm picking you.

05:40.474 --> 05:43.575
Yeah. At least I get
to be on camera.

05:45.812 --> 05:46.845
Whoa.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.715
That Heather girl's
bananas hot, right?

05:49.717 --> 05:50.849
I know.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.983
Look, coming from a guy

05:51.985 --> 05:54.553
that's pursuing a lady
parsecs out of his league,

05:54.555 --> 05:55.987
I can safely say,
"Keep dreamin'."

05:55.989 --> 05:58.924
Please.
Cameron slays ass, right?

05:58.926 --> 06:01.593
Tell him how you slay
all kinds of ass.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.728
Well, I wouldn't put it
like that,

06:02.730 --> 06:06.298
but this is how
a hacker gets it done.

06:06.300 --> 06:06.998
You slay dude's asses.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.234
- That's right. Do it.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.837
All right.
Okay. I'm bored.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.538
Boom.

06:16.075 --> 06:19.978
"Ambition." all right.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.913
Watch and learn.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.983
So... "Ambition," huh?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.284
Excuse me?
Your tat.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.687
It's the Chinese symbol
for ambition, right?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.055
Oh. You speak Chinese?

06:30.057 --> 06:32.758
Uh... No, I don't.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.560
So you saw my tattoo,
you looked it up,

06:35.562 --> 06:37.863
then came over to slip it
into casual conversation,

06:37.865 --> 06:40.999
as if that's not the most creepy thing
in the world?

06:41.001 --> 06:44.436
Did it work?

06:44.438 --> 06:45.337
No.

06:45.339 --> 06:46.071
No?
No.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.339
Our marriage certificate
came in.

06:47.341 --> 06:50.675
Try not to treat it like you do
everything else you own.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.044
Uh...
You two are married?

06:53.046 --> 06:56.515
Well, technically, yes,
but we, uh...

06:56.517 --> 06:57.516
Seriously?
That's twice this week

06:57.518 --> 07:00.652
you've stopped me from closing.
What are you doing?

07:03.990 --> 07:05.123
Oh.

07:05.125 --> 07:05.624
Uh...

07:05.626 --> 07:07.159
I told you I had a date!

07:07.161 --> 07:09.828
I didn't think
you were serious.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.663
Hi. I'm Molly.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.932
You're better than this.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.635
I did you a huge favor by getting you
that Green Card.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.738
The least you could do is not ste
on my game when I'm slaying ass.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.173
Oh, is that what
I witnessed?

07:21.175 --> 07:22.073
Because to me,
it just looked like

07:22.075 --> 07:24.176
you were talking out
of your ass.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.310
Oh, ding-ding-ding-ding!

07:25.312 --> 07:26.178
Stop playing Molly Kong.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.214
If I'm so annoying,
perhaps I will just move out.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.916
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!

07:47.400 --> 07:50.168

07:56.677 --> 07:57.843
Oz, we got a big problem.
Oh!

07:57.845 --> 07:59.878
Ever since Heather's
turned on the camera,

07:59.880 --> 08:01.713
Veronica's been
an out-of-control maniac.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.915
I've got mail!

08:03.917 --> 08:05.851
Hey, hey, hey,
that's federal property!

08:05.853 --> 08:07.786
Look, we all love Heather.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.820
Just when it comes
to Veronica,

08:08.822 --> 08:10.088
she seems to go
a little  <i>Mean Girls</i> on her.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.858
All we can do is let them
figure it out, and nobody gets hurt.

08:12.860 --> 08:13.992
Yeah, no, it's too late
for that.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.728
<i>You wanna know what makes</i>

08:48.562 --> 08:49.794
That thing.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.830
Oh, crap.
Somebody that matters.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.665
Celebrity cameo.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.400
Oh, my God. This is so great
for our video.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.135
You guys, come on!
Hey, everybody!

08:57.137 --> 09:00.071
<i>Look!</i>
<i>It is Mr. Shaun White...</i>

09:00.073 --> 09:02.040
She doesn't know
his name...

09:02.042 --> 09:03.875
World-famous rollerblader.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.044
Actually, that's not
quite what I do.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.813
- Come on.
- Let's get our blades on.

09:10.817 --> 09:11.883
Do one
of your famous tricks!

09:11.885 --> 09:14.419
Let's do that loop-de-loop
you do so well.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.654
I'm gonna go.

09:20.860 --> 09:21.993
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

09:21.995 --> 09:24.563
Hey. We've still got
the job, right, Tony?

09:24.565 --> 09:27.666
Just, uh, give me
a thumbs-up for a yes.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.802
I guess that finger
means a no.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.371
Oh, God!

09:33.706 --> 09:34.439
Married, huh?

09:34.441 --> 09:37.309
Uh, yeah.
It's kinda complicated.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.411
It always is.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.315
What the hell was that?

09:43.317 --> 09:44.783
That girl's
a ring wrangler.

09:44.785 --> 09:48.320
Groom grabber. Hubby humper?
She likes her men hitched.

09:48.322 --> 09:51.656
Are you sure?
'Cause that's kinda crazy.

09:51.658 --> 09:52.157
I know...

09:52.159 --> 09:55.994
But it is
the forbidden fruit.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.434
Are you eating a tomato
like an apple?

10:02.436 --> 10:04.402
Uh-huh.
Who... Who does that?

10:04.404 --> 10:07.405
I mean, seriously,
throw some burrata on that bitch.

10:12.044 --> 10:12.777
Hey, Mol.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.348
Look, I feel terrible
about our fight.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.617
Peace offering?
I got you the last cupcake.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.653
What do you say we give
our fake marriage another shot?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.889
Well, since you went to
all that effort, I suppose.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.359
Okay, good, 'cause I want
to get in with Heather Y.

10:27.361 --> 10:28.193
She digs married dudes...

10:28.195 --> 10:30.562
And I want to see
how this thing plays out.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.864
You are unbelievable.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.667
What? Just when I think you're
becoming a gentleman,

10:35.669 --> 10:38.703
you go and say something
absolutely ridiculous like that!

10:38.705 --> 10:40.171
Ooh, yeah. Yelling.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.340
Now we really sound married.
Okay, good, good. Um...

10:42.342 --> 10:43.642
Tikka masala sounds great.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.044
See you tonight,
sweetheart.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.613
What?

10:49.015 --> 10:49.514
God!

10:49.516 --> 10:52.550
Who here
needs a roommate?

10:52.552 --> 10:55.420
Welcome to
the Thunderdome.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.622
Ooh.
It's lovely.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.424
Thank you so much
for letting me stay.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.727
I've had quite enough
of Cameron.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.864
Forget about Cameron.
This is your new home.

11:05.931 --> 11:06.898
Let me give you a tour.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.733
Here are all
of my action figurines,

11:08.735 --> 11:09.701
arranged alphabetically

11:09.703 --> 11:12.070
from Admiral Ackbar
to General Zod.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.505
Very thorough.
Yeah.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.207
Here is the fridge.
Oh.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.909
Everyone needs a fridge.
Right?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.944
And of course,
the gaming center.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.380
Lovely.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.417
And of course, that's
where the magic happens,

11:25.419 --> 11:28.520
and if you're lucky,
I'll show you my wand.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.187
Pardon me?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.989
♪ Ta-da

11:30.991 --> 11:31.856
Oh. Thank goodness.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.159
I thought you meant something
completely different.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.698
<i>Hello? Get your hand</i>
<i>off your wand</i>

11:39.700 --> 11:40.999
and hightail it back
to the office.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.801
<i>My spidey-sense</i>
<i>is tingling.</i>

11:42.803 --> 11:45.070
Copy that, boss.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.374
What is your damage,
Veronica?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.442
Shh. Ever since Heather showed up,

11:50.444 --> 11:51.943
you've been acting
more bonkers than usual.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.679
Yeah, well, clearly Heather doesn't
have a very high opinion of me,

11:54.681 --> 11:58.049
and this video is a chance for her
to see me at my best.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.050
You... You do realize

11:59.052 --> 12:02.520
that we just loaded an American icon
into an ambulance?

12:02.522 --> 12:03.521
Come on.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.990
They're gonna leave it on the
cutting room floor. It's a saying.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.394
They're here.
What?

12:09.795 --> 12:10.628
Okay.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.197
Okay, it's a wrap.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.999
Ronnie,
it turned out great.

12:16.203 --> 12:16.801
It's gonna be very.

12:16.803 --> 12:20.171
That right? Well, when do
we see this opus?

12:20.906 --> 12:23.808
When do you see my opus?
Actually...

12:23.810 --> 12:28.179
We're premiering at
the O.C.P. Conference in a few days.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.348
You two, of course,
are invited to that.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.485
Totes!
I love surprises!

12:33.487 --> 12:35.053
The only thing I love
more than surprises

12:35.055 --> 12:39.357
is knowing every possible outcome
before it happens.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.327
Okay, cupcakes,
here's the dealio.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.028
Heather's been lying about
the video for the web site.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.098
How do we know that? Had an old friend
named Vincent Coccotti...

12:47.100 --> 12:48.500
He was counsel
for Blue Lou Boyle...

12:48.502 --> 12:49.667
Told me that
there are certain things

12:49.669 --> 12:51.202
a person does when they lie
that give 'em away.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.039
A typical man has 17 pantomimes.
A woman has 22.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.474
<i>First telltale sign...</i>

12:56.476 --> 12:58.276
<i>Heather repeated the question</i>
<i>when I asked.</i>

12:58.278 --> 13:00.845
That right?
When do we see this opus?

13:00.847 --> 13:03.114
When do you get to
see my opus?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.616
<i>She avoided eye contact,</i>

13:04.618 --> 13:07.018
<i>touched her nose</i>
<i>when she spoke,</i>

13:07.020 --> 13:08.653
<i>gave too much detail,</i>

13:08.655 --> 13:10.388
<i>changed her vocal pitch,</i>

13:10.390 --> 13:11.656
<i>took too many pauses,</i>

13:11.658 --> 13:13.424
<i>and of course,</i>
<i>the dead giveaway...</i>

13:13.426 --> 13:14.659
<i>She gave me</i>
<i>the old dice roll</i>

13:14.661 --> 13:18.596
<i>when she thought</i>
<i>my head was turned.</i>

13:20.366 --> 13:21.566
Spy shades.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.669
Sky Mall,
you've done it again.

13:25.271 --> 13:29.240
Now let's find out what the Heathers
are up to.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.777
Okay. Hacking into
Heather's e-mail.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.679
Let's see what
she's hiding.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.114
And...

13:36.650 --> 13:38.516
Ah, right there.
Click on that movie...

13:38.518 --> 13:39.884
"Bleep Veronica says."

13:39.886 --> 13:40.652
Okay.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.353
<i>And then on Fridays,</i>
<i>I like to turn</i>

13:42.355 --> 13:44.522
<i>this water cooler into</i>
<i>a white wine cooler. Mmm.</i>

13:44.524 --> 13:46.891
<i>How do you think our receptionist</i>
<i>got pregnant?</i>

13:46.893 --> 13:49.460
<i>I drink most of it.</i>

13:49.462 --> 13:51.529
<i>Has anybody</i>
<i>seen my glasses?</i>

13:51.531 --> 13:54.365
<i>What? No!</i>
<i>These aren't my glasses.</i>

13:54.367 --> 13:56.067
<i>Oh. Tap-able.</i>

13:56.069 --> 13:58.403
<i>Been there, done that.</i>
<i>Out of the question.</i>

13:58.405 --> 14:01.039
<i>Thought about it. Working on it.</i>
<i>Wearing her down.</i>

14:01.041 --> 14:03.041
<i>You only live once.</i>
<i>Even that.</i>

14:03.043 --> 14:04.809
<i>Late again and loving it.</i>

14:04.811 --> 14:08.713
<i>Oh, darn it.</i>
<i>Is it Saturday?</i>

14:08.715 --> 14:09.914
<i>Pfft. Not again.</i>

14:09.916 --> 14:11.449
This goes on
for another 20 minutes.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.220
Yeah, they're gonna eat her alive
at the O.C.P. Conference.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.154
What do we do?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.623
We gotta
kill the Heathers.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.426
Metaphorically.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.627
Maybe.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.063
To be determined.

14:25.065 --> 14:25.797
<i>Hey, what do you do here?</i>

14:25.799 --> 14:27.966
<i>More like, "What do</i>
<i>I do here," right?</i>

14:27.968 --> 14:29.968
Yeah, could you just
click that off?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.202
Now you see what
they've done here?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.171
They've used some
fancy editing techniques

14:33.173 --> 14:34.439
to make me look
like an idiot...

14:34.441 --> 14:38.543
because, you know, I'm not anything
like that in real life.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.712
Don't know how they pulled
that one off.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.880
Okay, great. Well,
it's my own darn fault.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.549
I probably should've
seen this coming after everything

14:44.551 --> 14:46.417
that Heather O'Brien and I
have been through.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.387
Wait a minute. She doesn't just hate you
for the regular reasons?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.789
I slept with her fiance
and her brother,

14:51.791 --> 14:54.592
and, uh, I made 'em do stuff
with each other.

14:54.594 --> 14:54.993
Oh!

14:54.995 --> 14:56.961
I guess I will simply
be embarrassed

14:56.963 --> 15:01.266
by this video in front of the
entire company, and that will be that.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.268
Good stuff.
All right. I'm out.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.502
If you need me,
I will be tattooing

15:04.504 --> 15:07.438
the word "idiot"
across my own face.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.440
Okay, we need
to help Veronica,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.943
so Operation Dumbo Swap is
in full effect.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.312
We're gonna break
into Heather's house,

15:14.314 --> 15:14.879
swap out her video

15:14.881 --> 15:17.181
for one that makes Veronica
look like a star.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.651
Cash, this ring is
a wireless spy cam.

15:19.653 --> 15:22.320
I need you to follow Veronica
in secret, record her,

15:22.322 --> 15:24.756
edit it together, and make her look
like a superstar.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.125
Wonder twin powers,
activate!

15:27.127 --> 15:29.394
Cameron, I need floor plans
of Heather's house pronto.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.563
I'm on it. I'll also distract the young,
hot Heather by dating her.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.932
How's that gonna help?
Don't question it.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.267
She's coming over tonight
to commit adultery.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.502
I mean, sure,
it's a little weird,

15:37.504 --> 15:38.503
but nobody's getting hurt,
right?

15:38.505 --> 15:41.139
Whoa, Cameron, your moral quandary,
it's a falsehood.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.273
You're not married.
She's not married.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.375
It's just consensual sex
between two crazy freaks.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.312
Okay. It's settled.
I'll sleep with her.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.480
And... And the Veronica thing.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.317
Oh, this is so crazy.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.319
Mmm. What if your wife
walked in on us?

15:54.321 --> 15:55.186
Oh, man,
that'd be awful,

15:55.188 --> 15:58.122
because I am totally
not single. Oh. Mmm.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.290
Mmm. Yeah?
Tell me more.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.492
Uh, yeah, I had, uh,
I had a June wedding in the Hamptons.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.828
Flowers cost me a fortune.
Oh! You're nasty.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.129
They... Yeah.
Oh. More.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.798
Uh, I couldn't invite
my college buddies,

16:06.800 --> 16:07.899
but she had to have
her second cousin there.

16:07.901 --> 16:09.467
I don't care about your cousin.
Okay.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.036
Tell me I'm hot.
Oh, you're so hot.

16:12.038 --> 16:12.570
Oh.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.604
Yeah. Tell me about your wife.
Oh.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.207
Huh? About your wife.
Uh, my wife, she just tells me

16:16.209 --> 16:17.508
I'm an inconsiderate
roommate...

16:17.510 --> 16:18.443
I mean...
I mean groommate,

16:18.445 --> 16:20.445
because that's what I am.
I'm... I'm a groom.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.846
Oh.
Yeah. Yeah.

16:21.848 --> 16:22.680
You poor baby.
I know.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.283
Oh, you must be so bored with
your stuffy British wife.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.150
Mmm.
Mmm.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.752
Hey, are we gonna talk
through this whole thing?

16:27.754 --> 16:30.922
Come on. Say it.
Say she's boring and uptight.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.290
No, I don't...
I'm not gonna say that.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.291
Yeah. Say it.
That's weird.

16:33.293 --> 16:36.294
Huh? Tell me. Tell me she's an uptight,
boring bitch, huh?

16:36.296 --> 16:38.129
Wait. Whoa!
Relax. That's not cool.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.031
Molly's actually
a really nice person.

16:40.033 --> 16:44.802
What? Wait. If she's so nice,
what are you doing with me?

16:44.804 --> 16:48.239
I'm beginning to ask myself
the same question.

16:48.507 --> 16:49.040
Ugh.

16:49.042 --> 16:52.910
Are you one of those nice guys that,
like, loves his wife?

16:52.912 --> 16:56.047
I mean, honestly, I can tell you,
at the moment, yes,

16:56.049 --> 16:57.949
I like her
more than I like you.

16:57.951 --> 17:00.451
Whatever.
I'm gonna motor.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.285
You're gonna motor?

17:01.287 --> 17:03.654
What the hell does
that mean?

17:08.293 --> 17:10.661
Okay, magic man,
you ready to dazzle me?

17:10.663 --> 17:11.262
Oh, damn right.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.431
I've been following Veronica
around for seven hours,

17:13.433 --> 17:14.465
editing for eight.
Mmm.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.401
Set your phasers
to "stun."

17:16.403 --> 17:17.969
<i>Hello... I'm...</i>

17:17.971 --> 17:18.569
<i>Veronica... And...</i>

17:18.571 --> 17:20.872
<i>I... Like...</i>
<i>Business... And...</i>

17:20.874 --> 17:22.273
<i>Money... And...</i>

17:22.275 --> 17:24.342
<i>Success... And smiles.</i>

17:24.344 --> 17:25.376
<i>Friendship... Boom!</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:26.444
<i>Shaka-laka-laka!</i>

17:26.446 --> 17:27.178
What the hell is this?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.813
Hey, the woman
can't say three words

17:28.815 --> 17:30.715
without saying
something cuckoo nutballs.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.383
Hey, I did the best
I could.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.484
Maybe Heather's right, Oz.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.220
Veronica is
super incompetent.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.022
She's standing right behind me,
isn't she?

17:38.024 --> 17:40.725
No. No. she's standing
right next to you.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.060
How do you not see her?

17:42.062 --> 17:44.495
I told you, I have
weak peripheral vision.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.999
Okay, you boys can stop
whatever you're doing.

17:48.001 --> 17:49.634
Heather is right.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.536
I am a lost cause.

17:52.137 --> 17:53.638
Well...

17:53.640 --> 17:55.106
Oh!

17:55.108 --> 17:56.240
Who...

17:56.242 --> 17:57.375
Man, you weren't lying,
dude.

17:57.377 --> 18:01.646
It's like you got one of those
invisible doggy cones around your neck.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.514
Oh!

18:09.521 --> 18:12.323
Okay. Great.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.424
Here we are.
In and out.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.160
Nobody gets hurt,
except me. Perfect.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.229
Look, you can do this,
okay?

18:18.231 --> 18:19.997
Just stay strong.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.898
Yeah, well, I could
do that or...

18:20.900 --> 18:24.135
Ooh. I could go talk to Hank Donaldson
in Marketing.

18:24.137 --> 18:24.836
He's my weed guy.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.904
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No illegal substances.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.439
You're right.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.208
Hey, ladies,
down in front.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.144
Oh, great. Fantastic.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.913
So you guys came by
to see the big bloodbath?

18:35.915 --> 18:37.482
Look, Vee, I know
I give you a hard time,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.284
but I like you too much
to see this happen to you.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.720
Oswald, come on.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.289
Let's just rip
the Band-Aid off, okay?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.161
Hey, Heather!

18:50.163 --> 18:50.962
Let's roll this pig!

18:50.964 --> 18:54.599
<i>And then on Fridays, I like</i>
<i>to turn this water cooler</i>

18:54.601 --> 18:55.399
<i>into a white wine cooler.</i>

18:55.401 --> 18:58.002
<i>Mmm! How do you think</i>
<i>our receptionist got pregnant?</i>

18:58.004 --> 19:00.138
<i>I drink most of it.</i>

19:00.140 --> 19:01.839
<i>No.</i>
<i>Whoo! Look at that!</i>

19:01.841 --> 19:03.508
<i>I'm flying!</i>

19:03.510 --> 19:04.175
<i>Oh!</i>

19:04.177 --> 19:07.512
<i>What? No.</i>
<i>These aren't my glasses.</i>

19:15.854 --> 19:17.321
You are too much,
Veronica.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.589
This is the best
conference ever.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.392
Wish we had you at Corporate.
They're a bunch of stiffs.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.327
Yeah.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.029
Well...

19:25.031 --> 19:26.030
Oh.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.331
What the hell
is happening?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.467
I believe you are a hit.
What?

19:29.469 --> 19:31.736
You're so crazy, they thought you must
be joking.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.572
I did it again,
right, Jimmy!

19:34.574 --> 19:36.307
High five up top.

19:36.441 --> 19:37.275
Thank you.

19:39.712 --> 19:43.548
I think it's very sweet that you
guys tried to protect Veronica.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.483
Well, that's what we do
in this office.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.818
We protect our own.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.321
Look, I suppose
if you'd like,

19:50.323 --> 19:52.957
we could do some more
marriage bickering

19:52.959 --> 19:56.427
just to salvage whatever weird thing
you have with Heather.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.565
How do you know
it needs salvaging?

20:00.567 --> 20:00.932
Um...

20:00.934 --> 20:04.268
Because I... Was hiding
behind the couch

20:04.270 --> 20:06.737
like a perv who likes
to spy on her roommate?

20:06.739 --> 20:07.338
I...
Yes.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.541
No, I actually came back
for my retainer and...

20:10.543 --> 20:12.076
You knew I was there
the whole time?

20:12.078 --> 20:13.911
Yeah. Why do you think I was
on the couch all night?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.947
I wanted to see
how long you'd last.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.224
Listen, you can move back in
if you want to.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.024
You mean it?

20:27.026 --> 20:29.193
Yeah, I'll even try
to close the cabinets.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.295
No, you won't.
I really won't.

20:31.297 --> 20:34.932
And I will try and let you close
with the ladies.

20:35.501 --> 20:38.436
<i>Game over.</i>

20:40.539 --> 20:41.939
Hey! Look who it is.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.107
Mr. White!

20:43.109 --> 20:44.208
Shaun!

20:44.210 --> 20:44.942
What are you doing here?

20:44.944 --> 20:47.378
I thought I'd drop off
a signed skateboard

20:47.380 --> 20:48.980
and a signed contract.

20:48.982 --> 20:49.714
What changed your mind?

20:49.716 --> 20:52.283
Well, your boss is
very persuasive.

20:54.119 --> 20:54.852
Aah!

20:54.854 --> 20:57.388
Yeah, that's right.
Run away, crybabies!

20:57.390 --> 20:58.189
Come back
when you're ready

20:58.191 --> 21:00.725
for a woman who's
going through the change!

21:02.028 --> 21:03.127
Right here.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.129
Wow. I can't believe
I'm saying this,

21:05.131 --> 21:09.066
but Vee, I am happy
to have you on my side.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.302
Um, Veronica, Heather's back,
and she's...

21:11.304 --> 21:14.238
Oh, you think that
have beaten me, Veronica?

21:14.240 --> 21:17.642
I will tell you something,
and that is that I will not stop

21:17.644 --> 21:20.144
until I... Aah!

21:20.679 --> 21:22.246
Ugh.

21:22.248 --> 21:25.182
I've never seen anyone
do that before!

21:26.485 --> 21:27.485
I have.
