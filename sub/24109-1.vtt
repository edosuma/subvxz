01:03.200 --> 01:06.840
SPECTRE

01:31.120 --> 01:33.560
Two thousand and five.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.360
Fifty-eight.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.760
Twenty-two.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.760
A hundred and eleven.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.480
A hundred and thirty-five.
A hundred and ten.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.920
A thousand and thirty-six.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.920
A thousand and thirty... A thousand.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.240
Hi. Welcome to the nuthouse.
TODAY 4 DECEMBER

02:40.440 --> 02:42.520
A thousand and thirty-six.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.240
You're new here, aren't you?
Don't be afraid.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.120
"It's better to be absolutely ridiculous
than absolutely boring."

02:58.320 --> 03:01.200
"Poo poo bee doo." Marilyn Monroe.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.760
Hey, hello. Vronsky.
I'm a resident here too, just like you.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.480
What am I doing here?
- You were counting.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.200
No, I'm trying to remember something.
- What?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.600
Numbers.
- Thrilling. Any luck?

03:17.880 --> 03:21.000
If I invent a story around them, yes.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.960
Why in God's name are you doing that?

03:26.320 --> 03:27.960
I have a bad memory.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.800
That's the answer to your question.
- What question?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.960
Why you are in the nuthouse, of course.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.920
We've got a complete nutcase here.
What are you on?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.080
Hey, I want what she's had!

03:43.080 --> 03:47.760
So don't you know who you are
or are you just being rude?

03:48.280 --> 03:52.560
A normal person says their name
if someone introduces themselves to them.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.920
But... what is normal, eh?

03:57.480 --> 04:02.120
What is normal for the spider,
is chaos for the fly!

04:02.320 --> 04:05.160
That's not mine. Morticia Addams.

04:05.920 --> 04:06.960
Hey.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.000
What's your name?

04:10.080 --> 04:13.200
Mie.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.640
Annemie D'Haeze suffers
from anterograde amnesia

04:20.840 --> 04:23.400
since her car accident last March.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.320
So her memory from before the accident
is intact?

04:26.520 --> 04:31.240
Yes. She knows who she is.
She knows her family.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.520
And everyone she met before the accident.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.400
And since the accident
all new information is erased?

04:37.600 --> 04:38.760
Wiped out.

04:39.240 --> 04:43.000
Mie compares it to a sandstorm
swirling past and wiping everything out.

04:43.320 --> 04:48.320
But it's not a problem.
Annemie has learned to live with her illness,

04:48.520 --> 04:51.400
just like we have.
- It's not an illness, Rita.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.080
Isn't it? What would you call it then?
- Is Mrs D'Haeze aware of her memory loss?

04:56.680 --> 05:00.080
My wife forgets what she knows
but she's not stupid.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.400
She knows that she forgets.

05:03.640 --> 05:09.440
Look, her brain is still taking in information,
but she can only store it temporarily.

05:09.640 --> 05:14.200
How long is temporarily?
- That depends, Inspector.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.760
All we know is that stress and panic attacks

05:17.960 --> 05:20.720
erase her newly acquired memories.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.880
The fear of forgetting in itself
can cause enough stress

05:25.080 --> 05:27.560
to make everything disappear.

05:28.840 --> 05:32.720
Sorry, Dr De Vos. My daughter doesn't
belong in a secure psychiatric ward.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.200
When will she be allowed to leave?
- Look...

05:35.400 --> 05:37.920
As long as Annemie is
a danger to herself and others,

05:38.120 --> 05:41.960
we will keep her in observation.
Don't worry. You can see her shortly.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.200
As long as your visit
doesn't compromise our investigation.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.760
My wife needs help and rest now, doctor.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.480
I don't see how a police investigation
will give her that.

05:51.680 --> 05:56.160
I would like to know why we've spent
all this time talking about my daughter.

05:56.360 --> 06:00.160
Rita, calm down, please...
- Will you let me finish?

06:00.680 --> 06:04.560
All of a sudden she's been put away
in a secure psychiatric ward

06:04.760 --> 06:07.360
while we're wasting our time
with some hideous cushion.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.560
Madam, listen.
We're only asking for your cooperation.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.640
The first days
in a disappearance case are crucial.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.560
They determine whether the missing person
will be found safe and sound.

06:18.760 --> 06:22.600
Her memory loss doesn't necessarily mean
she's involved in this case.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.280
From the doctor's explanation,
we can infer

06:25.480 --> 06:30.000
that stress is one of the most important
factors in the memory erasing process.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.800
That's why,
as long as my investigation is ongoing,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.280
we shouldn't talk to the suspect
about sensitive issues.

06:36.960 --> 06:41.440
The suspect?
So my wife has become the suspect?

06:41.960 --> 06:47.160
With all due respect, sir,
Mrs D'Haeze is our only lead in this case.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.640
If she loses her mind again,
we won't have anything left to go on.

06:51.760 --> 06:55.120
OK, right.
So what sensitive issues should we avoid?

06:55.320 --> 06:58.760
How she is connected to
the missing person, for example.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.920
You should avoid certain subjects.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.320
You may go and visit her.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.520
Only under these conditions.
Sign there please.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.960
If you obstruct the investigation,
it will have legal consequences.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.320
She really needs your support.
- There you are.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.720
Good morning, Mrs D'Haeze.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.360
How are you today?

07:45.600 --> 07:51.320
Inspector, I'll stay in the room
the first time, to see how it goes.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.000
Sure.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.120
Inspector Wolkers, Federal Police.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.680
I'm investigating
the disappearance of Thomas Spectre.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.240
This man has been missing
for a few days now.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.440
Does he look familiar to you?

08:27.920 --> 08:32.080
How long have I been here?
- Since yesterday.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.160
Who's that person?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.440
Thomas Spectre.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.640
He is missing.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.920
Never seen him before.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.960
Are you sure? Maybe you've forgotten?

08:52.600 --> 08:56.680
Could you have met him
but you don't remember?

08:58.840 --> 09:00.640
Maybe you should...

09:02.240 --> 09:05.000
Maybe you should ask my mum.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.680
Or Benoit. I don't know.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.920
Don't worry.
- I want to see my family.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.520
We'll take it slowly.

09:20.680 --> 09:25.120
Maybe you should see
some familiar faces first.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.360
Hello.
- Hi.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.480
Hi.
- Hi.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.000
Hi.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.840
Hello, darling.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.440
Romy hasn't come?
- No, she's with your sister.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.200
You don't want her
to see you like this, do you?

10:10.760 --> 10:14.000
Later, when you're better.
- Sure.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.800
Benoit, why am I here?

10:19.440 --> 10:22.000
You've had a bit of a relapse, honeybird.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.840
You have to get some rest here.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.160
We've just spoken to the doctor.
You'll be out of here in no time.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.160
A policeman came by.

10:37.360 --> 10:42.080
He wanted to know if...
Apparently someone has disappeared.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.640
Really?
- Yes.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.960
He was asking if I knew him.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.880
And?
- No.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.400
Maybe we should...
- Talk to that policeman.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.360
How's the food here?

11:02.240 --> 11:04.200
Look what we've brought.

11:05.720 --> 11:10.120
We thought you might want to put them up.
- It would cheer the place up.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.440
The house.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.520
We moved house.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.720
3 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

11:34.560 --> 11:36.800
FOR SÃ…LE

11:37.000 --> 11:41.120
No, no, no. Leave it there.
- But we're going to be here for a while.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.040
So? It won't sell that fast.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.640
You were lucky it wasn't sold already.
What would you have done then?

11:48.840 --> 11:50.720
We would have rented a flat in the city.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.520
And I would have to drive back and forth.
Forget it.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.800
Forget it...

11:55.000 --> 11:59.120
Darling, I know you want to do everything
on your own but we know what happens then.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.600
Come on.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.480
Romy...

12:04.680 --> 12:07.200
The fresh air does her good.
Let her play outside...

12:07.400 --> 12:10.280
She's my child. Romy?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.920
Romy?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.000
Romy?

12:20.640 --> 12:22.880
Did I scare you?
- Yes, you did.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.880
Come on, let's take a photo.
With the house. And Grandma.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.920
Lola. How many times do I have to tell you?
Grandma is for old people.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.440
As long as you call me Annemie,
I will call you Grandma.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.560
Come on. Romy, go and stand
next to Grandma... Lola, sorry.

12:49.720 --> 12:54.360
An induction hob.
So you can't burn down my inheritance.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.680
Rita...
- Yes, I know that fire was an accident.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.200
We all forget a pan's on the stove sometimes.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.000
Everyone forgets things
but if you forget you're forgetful,

13:04.200 --> 13:07.400
you need a camera in the kitchen,
don't you?

13:09.280 --> 13:11.000
Here we go.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.360
Now we can get to work.

13:18.560 --> 13:24.120
Here, make yourself useful. Rather than
installing spy gadgets everywhere.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Mum!

13:27.120 --> 13:31.720
This house is massive.
- Isn't it? It was my grandpa's house.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.240
Have you chosen a room?
- The attic.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.440
Not the attic.
- Are there any scary ghosts up there?

13:38.640 --> 13:41.840
There's only one scary ghost up there.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.080
And that's you!

13:59.840 --> 14:02.640
We need to drain that basement.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.720
Thank God I put everything up on pallets.

14:06.160 --> 14:09.440
Oh, by the way...
Morinneke asked me to redo their interior.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.040
Morinneke?
- Morinneke, the tea room in town.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.480
Oh right.
- I can do their curtains and tablecloths.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.840
I was thinking Laura Ashley style.
The customers will love that.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.040
Pink, off-white, cake and ice cream.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.440
It's not a lot of money
but they will display my business cards

14:27.640 --> 14:29.880
and they get a lot of customers.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.840
These chairs can go, right?
- No, hold on. They're so pretty.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.920
<i>I love you, I need you. Forever yours. Rita.</i>

14:40.120 --> 14:44.800
<i>So I need to reprint my cards.
But when will I squeeze that in?</i>

14:45.000 --> 14:49.120
We can manage on our own, Rita.
- Are you crazy?

14:49.320 --> 14:52.000
I really don't mind helping you guys out.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.840
I'm actually glad to be out of the house.
Honestly. That Sandy is getting on my nerves.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.240
Is it really too much to do the ironing
or the dishes once in a while?

15:00.440 --> 15:03.760
Maybe it's because she's not a cleaner
but a nursing aide.

15:03.960 --> 15:08.600
Well, she's not "aiding" me a lot.
- Look here, a ChÃ¢teau PÃ©trus from 1969.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.440
She's such a lazy cow.
She leaves half an hour early now

15:12.640 --> 15:14.600
so she can go and fuck her new boyfriend.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.840
I've really had it, Annemie.
- Mie.

15:18.040 --> 15:24.360
I'm 55, in the prime of my life.
I'm at the peak of my creativity.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.160
I would love to go and fuck a new boyfriend too.
- Mum, please.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.920
What? I can't say that?

15:33.200 --> 15:36.720
Do you know what it's like
to live with someone with Alzheimer's?

15:36.920 --> 15:39.880
Here we go.
- No, darling, you don't have Alzheimer's.

15:40.080 --> 15:46.240
For you and Benoit there is still hope, but for
me and your father the future is less bright.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.400
Stop, stop, stop. Let's take a break.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.600
There you go.
A small toast. To a new start.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.280
And for my honeybird.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.520
To a new start.
- To a new start.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.080
Cheers.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.640
Ugh! Yuk!

16:09.840 --> 16:13.880
Grandpa made his own wine.
Cat pee tasted better.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.280
But he put it in fancy bottles, didn't he?
- To Grandpa.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.840
Mie?
- Yes?

16:28.040 --> 16:29.760
Mie, come and have a look.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.520
This is the latest thing. Watch this.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.120
What?
- Wait a minute.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.360
<i>Close door.</i>
- Hear that?

16:49.520 --> 16:52.000
We can alter the volume.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.920
<i>Close door.</i>
- Great.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.840
<i>Close door.</i>

17:03.760 --> 17:05.360
<i>Close door.</i>

17:12.040 --> 17:13.680
<i>Close door.</i>

17:14.480 --> 17:16.280
<i>Benoit?</i>
- Close door.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.280
<i>Close door.</i>

17:24.600 --> 17:26.720
<i>Are they allowed to hunt here?</i>

17:27.360 --> 17:28.840
Hello.

17:29.640 --> 17:33.440
It must be hunting season.
- This is private property.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.000
He's just passing by.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.640
TODAY
4 DECEMBER

17:55.320 --> 17:56.480
Hey, psst.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.600
You don't remember me, do you?

18:00.920 --> 18:04.760
We played hide the salami earlier.
Have you forgotten already?

18:05.480 --> 18:07.120
Vronsky.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.360
We're colleagues.

18:10.960 --> 18:15.400
What's wrong with you?
- I am a pyromaniac.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.440
Shouldn't you be in prison then?

18:22.280 --> 18:25.240
They say I'm crazy in the head!

18:27.640 --> 18:33.760
But... what do "they" know?
"They" should never be trusted.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.600
Aren't you eating that?

18:40.560 --> 18:43.920
Come on, Mie, that's the best part.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.480
The food's shit otherwise.

18:53.280 --> 18:58.640
Apparently you burnt your house down.
How did you start it?

18:58.840 --> 19:03.520
Short circuit? A cigarette?
White spirit?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.200
Spirit?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.640
Thomas Spectre.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.720
Why are you saying that?
- I was referring to paint thinner, silly.

19:17.240 --> 19:22.400
Is that how you burnt down your house?
- I don't know.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.800
It was an accident.
- That's what we all say.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.720
Is that why you're locked up?

19:35.960 --> 19:40.440
No, I moved to my grandparents' house
after the fire.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.200
So the fire must have happened way before.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.800
And you remember that?

19:48.960 --> 19:51.560
If I remember something, I write it down.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.080
Is that me? Show me.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.200
You're drawing me
so tomorrow you'll remember...

20:00.400 --> 20:02.520
That we didn't "hide the salami".

20:04.320 --> 20:06.960
Never say never.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.400
What's this?

20:12.680 --> 20:15.200
What's on the other half?
- I don't know.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.560
You don't know much anymore, do you?

20:22.760 --> 20:24.280
And this, what's this?

20:26.680 --> 20:32.800
Your sketches are better than this.
- They're my daughter's. Give here, please.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.640
I'm going on a trip
and I'm taking...

20:43.840 --> 20:48.280
Mr Bear, a photo album,
my polka-dot dress,

20:48.480 --> 20:52.680
3 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE
a coffee machine and my story book.

20:52.880 --> 20:58.880
Um... I'm going on a trip
and I'm taking...

20:59.080 --> 21:01.160
Mr Bear...

21:02.840 --> 21:05.400
my photo albums...

21:05.600 --> 21:08.720
Uh... my polka-dot dress, my...

21:11.280 --> 21:14.400
Wait a second...
What was it again?

21:19.120 --> 21:22.000
You can't remember.
I win!

21:29.400 --> 21:33.040
Honey bear. Your coffee is here.
- Right.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.680
Ta-da!

21:38.800 --> 21:41.640
Day, time and month.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.760
Oh, here.

21:47.920 --> 21:53.680
Your purse. Your keys. Your mobile.
And here, hold this...

21:55.320 --> 21:58.480
Your panic button. Try it.

22:06.840 --> 22:11.360
Oh, panic, panic, panic. I'm on my way.
- Isn't this over the top?

22:11.560 --> 22:14.680
Over the top? Do you remember
when you got lost in the mall?

22:14.880 --> 22:16.280
No.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.480
There you go.

22:23.320 --> 22:28.040
It's been a month since we last...
- Really?

22:28.240 --> 22:32.000
Not really, but I thought
it would be a good strategy to...

22:32.200 --> 22:33.400
Mummy!

22:33.600 --> 22:37.120
We have to break in
your grandparents' house.

22:38.280 --> 22:43.160
When she's asleep.
- Mum, can we play another game?

22:47.280 --> 22:51.200
Romy, Daddy says you can watch a movie.
- Hooray!

22:51.400 --> 22:56.960
Snow White. Snow White! That's an hour
and a half. Will that be long enough?

22:57.800 --> 23:01.720
Just about. Just about.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.160
Come on. Go to bed. Mr Bear.
- Mr Bear.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.320
Are you happy with your room?

23:23.120 --> 23:24.600
Come on.

23:26.480 --> 23:30.120
Romy D'Haeze, how many times?
Don't leave your clothes lying around.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.760
Mummy!

23:33.400 --> 23:35.400
It was an accident.

23:36.760 --> 23:37.800
It fell.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.440
Romy...

23:42.920 --> 23:44.680
How did that happen?

23:45.880 --> 23:48.280
Are you angry?
- I'm not angry

23:48.480 --> 23:51.120
but you should tell me
instead of hiding it.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.840
Sorry.

23:54.320 --> 23:58.000
Doesn't matter. Go on, go to sleep.

24:00.320 --> 24:04.080
Sleep tight, my little angel.
- Sleep tight, sweet Mummy.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.800
What? What's wrong?

24:25.480 --> 24:28.280
Romy dropped Grandpa's mirror.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.360
And you're worried
your mum will have a fit again.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.600
Throw it away and don't mention it.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.720
My grandpa used to say
it kept evil spirits out.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.000
Really? Broken mirrors bring good luck.

24:44.360 --> 24:48.240
No, bad luck. He said the spirits
came in through the cracks.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.760
Everything will be OK,
this is only temporary.

24:50.960 --> 24:54.400
Once the fire insurance comes through...
- Romy is asleep.

24:54.600 --> 24:58.120
... we'll look for a new place in the city.

24:59.200 --> 25:03.720
I could be happy here.
At least it's familiar.

25:04.960 --> 25:09.480
Great, because in this maze
the toilet is on the left.

25:10.280 --> 25:14.160
The stairs are on the right.
Not like in our previous house.

25:14.360 --> 25:18.640
What? Am I not allowed
to make life pleasanter for you?

25:19.440 --> 25:22.280
It depends what you mean
by pleasanter.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.400
OK.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.960
Benoit, you're snoring.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.880
No, you're snoring.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.440
I can't forget. Can't forget. Can't forget.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.080
Mie?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.360
Mie?

27:46.080 --> 27:47.640
Did you hurt yourself?

27:49.720 --> 27:52.400
I told you. The toilet is on the left.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.240
I forgot.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.000
Where does it hurt?

28:07.280 --> 28:09.360
The toilet is on the left.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.920
And the stairs are...
- I know.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.080
Come on, show me.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.440
Here?

28:21.320 --> 28:23.880
It's OK. It's OK.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.440
Good morning.
- Hi.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.920
Did you sleep well?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.680
Yes. You?

28:48.520 --> 28:50.360
Yes. Yes.

28:51.600 --> 28:55.960
Oh, French toast, yummy!
- How many can you eat?

28:56.160 --> 28:58.520
Millions.
- Millions?

28:58.800 --> 29:03.200
We'll start with one. Chocolate spread?
- Yes.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.360
Chocolate spread.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.720
Do you want to go to the doctor later?

29:10.200 --> 29:12.320
No. I just didn't sleep right. Milk?

29:12.720 --> 29:17.680
Yes. Is there any chocolate milk?
- No, you've got chocolate spread already.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.120
Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.520
Yes?

29:27.480 --> 29:31.560
What did you dream about?
- Rabbits.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.000
Benoit?
- Yes?

29:38.200 --> 29:39.920
Where is my mobile?

29:40.560 --> 29:43.800
There's a tray in the hall.
- Yes.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.640
It's not here.
- You have to put it back in the tray.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.880
I did.
- Sure.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.920
Impossible.
I haven't been in the basement.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.360
It must have been Romy.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.360
What?

30:37.320 --> 30:41.120
You just need
to get used to the house. OK?

30:54.800 --> 30:58.680
I'm not crazy.
I really haven't been in that basement.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.880
Benoit?

32:03.600 --> 32:06.120
Mie, what's happening? Is everything OK?

32:06.480 --> 32:09.400
These dolls scared the hell out of me.
- Jesus.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.320
What's that?
- What?

32:12.200 --> 32:17.120
Look. Hey. Here, kitty kitty. Come here you.
- Oh, Mie.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.920
Don't be scared.
- Don't touch it, it's filthy.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.120
Come here you.
- Don't.

32:22.320 --> 32:26.920
Hi. Look, she's only got three legs.
- And I've only got two. Come on.

32:38.320 --> 32:41.480
TODAY
4 DECEMBER

32:51.880 --> 32:53.560
Good afternoon, Mrs D'Haeze.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.720
Hello, Mr Wolkers.
- It's Inspector Wolkers.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.600
Doesn't matter. You seem to be
doing better. You remembered me.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.720
Oh yes... OK.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.920
I, uh... I was here this morning as well.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.200
Do you remember that?

33:23.160 --> 33:30.160
We were talking about this man.
He's been missing for a few days now.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.880
Should I know him?

33:36.800 --> 33:38.400
Thomas Spectre.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.320
Doesn't ring a bell?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.640
Sorry.
- That's OK.

33:47.520 --> 33:51.920
The doctor here explained to me

33:52.120 --> 33:56.080
that memory is triggered
by sensory perceptions.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.400
You could compare it
to a dead car battery...

34:01.960 --> 34:05.960
... and I have brought some jumper cables.

34:14.040 --> 34:16.480
I would like you to smell this.

34:26.960 --> 34:30.360
And?
- I can smell pine.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.040
Sorry?

34:34.120 --> 34:37.160
Like those car fresheners
that look like trees.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.160
MOVED!
58 LOUIS CAROL LÃ…NE, NEVELGEM

35:03.920 --> 35:08.920
3 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

35:09.120 --> 35:11.360
You have reached your destination.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.280
We're here.

35:15.720 --> 35:18.600
I don't want to.
- Come on.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.960
You will make new friends in no time.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.480
No one will want to play with me.
- Of course they will.

35:25.680 --> 35:29.560
There will be loads of new kids
looking for friends.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.800
Let's go.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.720
Sweetie...

35:45.680 --> 35:47.320
Be brave, eh?

35:49.360 --> 35:50.800
Kiss.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.320
Off you go.

35:57.880 --> 35:58.920
Bye.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.160
Electronics.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.160
Sir?

36:39.680 --> 36:43.080
Sir? Hello. I've got a box
of electrical devices.

36:43.280 --> 36:48.000
Could you tell me where they have to go?
- The iron basket.

36:50.440 --> 36:54.520
OK. I've got more stuff in my car.

36:57.720 --> 37:00.360
But I'm sure I can manage.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.760
Hey, lady...

37:10.920 --> 37:12.360
Give it here.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.720
Thank you.

37:24.840 --> 37:30.120
Uh... paint pots
and broken tiles, I think.

37:31.760 --> 37:35.600
Hold on, I will... Let me...
- Thank you.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.760
Spring cleaning?

37:42.400 --> 37:46.840
No, we've just moved. Hi, honey bear.
- Hi, honeybird, it's me.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.720
I'm home already.
- Are you?

37:49.960 --> 37:55.640
Do you need help at the recycling centre?
- No, I'm fine.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.800
I'm nearly done.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.560
Use the satnav to drive home.
I've programmed the new address.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.160
OK. But can I remove that note?
- Why?

38:06.640 --> 38:10.680
What if you forget your satnav again?
- It's embarrassing.

38:11.320 --> 38:15.320
Embarrassing? Why?
- In front of other people.

38:15.520 --> 38:21.200
Mums at the school gate.
- We'll talk about it later, OK?

38:22.240 --> 38:26.440
OK, fine. See you later.
- Bye.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.320
Oh yeah, that too.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.000
Do you still need it?

38:35.560 --> 38:37.840
No. You can have that, too.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.320
Thanks.
- Thanks for your help.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.200
Bye.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.120
CAR FRESHENER
PINE

39:39.400 --> 39:40.480
Car freshener.

39:40.680 --> 39:43.840
TODAY
4 DECEMBER

39:46.880 --> 39:48.200
That's all?

39:55.800 --> 39:57.480
How come that occurred to you?

39:59.840 --> 40:01.440
That's what I can smell.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.440
Women supposedly have
a good sense of smell.

40:08.040 --> 40:13.120
Yes. Women supposedly have
a good memory, too.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.560
Maybe you should try again?

40:20.320 --> 40:21.760
I'm not your dog.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.520
No, you're right.
You're not my sniffer dog, no.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.840
But you are the last person
that was seen with Thomas Spectre

40:34.040 --> 40:37.040
a few days before
his disturbing disappearance.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.120
Says who?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.080
Witnesses.

40:55.200 --> 41:00.840
This man's fate is in your hands
at the moment, Mrs D'Haeze.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.720
Here. You can keep it.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.760
Are you enjoying your time here?

41:28.840 --> 41:30.680
When can I go home?

41:35.040 --> 41:36.800
When we've found Spectre.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.120
Spectre?

41:48.120 --> 41:50.800
Benoit doesn't believe in ghosts or spectres.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.080
Benoit doesn't believe me.

41:57.880 --> 42:02.760
3 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

42:10.520 --> 42:12.880
Hi.
- Hi, honeybird. It's me.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.440
My meeting has just finished.
- Only now?

42:15.640 --> 42:19.800
Yes, sorry it ran late
but I'm on my way home now. OK?

42:20.000 --> 42:23.760
OK, drive carefully.
- Yes, of course. Kiss. See you in a minute.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.320
Bye.

43:03.400 --> 43:06.200
Toilet on the left. Stairs on the right.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.960
Yeah, Benoit, only half a tablet.

43:39.440 --> 43:43.040
Two thousand three hundred
and twenty-three.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.240
Benoit?

44:03.040 --> 44:04.640
Hello, pussycat.

44:05.640 --> 44:08.760
What are you doing here?

44:09.160 --> 44:11.720
Didn't I shut you in the kitchen?

44:12.800 --> 44:14.120
Hey.

44:17.280 --> 44:21.360
You're a Houdini.
You're a real Houdini.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.960
Is that a nice name?

44:41.440 --> 44:44.240
Hello.
- Hi, honeybird. It's me.

44:44.440 --> 44:47.120
My meeting has just finished.

44:47.320 --> 44:53.120
Sorry it ran late,
but I'm on my way home now. OK?

46:06.880 --> 46:08.720
Good morning.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.440
Has Romy gone to school?

46:17.440 --> 46:20.880
What's wrong?
- What time have you got?

46:22.040 --> 46:23.840
Eleven minutes past ten.

46:25.880 --> 46:28.280
Something isn't right.
- What isn't right?

46:28.480 --> 46:30.480
Something's wrong with the clocks.

46:31.080 --> 46:34.280
They are brand new, Mie.
I installed them last week.

46:34.480 --> 46:36.080
You didn't do it properly then.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.600
Tea?

46:45.040 --> 46:50.800
What is going on in that head of yours?
- No, what is going on in this house?

46:51.440 --> 46:54.320
Mie, ghosts and spectres don't exist.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.400
You know what the doctors warned you about.

47:01.080 --> 47:05.480
Those confabulations.
If you can't remember and you're confused,

47:05.680 --> 47:09.960
your imagination will fill in the gaps.
It's alright. OK?

47:11.680 --> 47:12.720
Yeah?

47:14.320 --> 47:15.360
OK.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.920
I'm so fed up with it.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.520
So fed up with forgetting things.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.640
Honey bear?

47:39.520 --> 47:42.080
Promise me you'll never have me committed.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.520
Promise me.
- Where did that come from?

47:45.720 --> 47:47.320
Promise me.

47:49.280 --> 47:53.280
Honeybird, I promise to never,
ever have you committed. OK?

47:55.920 --> 48:01.720
And soon the fog in
that beautiful head of yours will clear.

48:06.520 --> 48:08.120
Just hang in there.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.840
Come on, your memory exercises.

48:17.280 --> 48:18.840
Twenty-two.

48:21.760 --> 48:23.360
Nine hundred and ninety-nine.

48:23.720 --> 48:25.400
999 BALLET STORIES

48:25.880 --> 48:27.960
A thousand two hundred and fifteen.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.080
MUSICAL STAR'S CAREER CRASHES

49:17.560 --> 49:24.440
MUSICAL STAR MIE D'HAEZE
INVOLVED IN SERIOUS CAR ACCIDENT

49:25.880 --> 49:29.080
NEXT TIME

49:29.280 --> 49:31.960
Hello, Mie speaking.
There's something about this house.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.120
Hello.

49:36.720 --> 49:38.920
Who am I speaking to?
- Mummy, who is that?

49:40.720 --> 49:41.640
<i>Close door.</i>

49:41.840 --> 49:43.520
<i>They found you in the woods, Mie.</i>

49:43.720 --> 49:46.120
Your arm was injured
and you were covered in blood.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.800
Where did Thomas Spectre get this?

49:49.000 --> 49:51.520
I have to get my daughter.
- Daughter?

49:51.720 --> 49:54.840
Who's this?
- Hip hip hurray!

49:55.200 --> 49:56.720
<i>Close door.</i>

49:57.560 --> 49:58.480
<i>Close...</i>
