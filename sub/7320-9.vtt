WEBVTT

00:13.000 --> 00:16.267
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:16.300 --> 00:17.767
YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO ME.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.167
YOU THINK YOU ARE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.
YOU ARE NOWHERE NEAR
HARD-CORE ENOUGH

00:21.200 --> 00:22.600
TO COMMIT TO CARDIO.

00:22.633 --> 00:25.467
WHY ISN'T THIS EASIER?
I DON'T KNOW.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.767
WELL, I WANT
MY BEST FRIEND BACK.
YOU DESERVE THE JOB.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.567
I SHOULD'VE GIVEN IT TO YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.100
THINGS ARE GONNA BE DIFFERENT
FROM HERE ON IN.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.500
YOUR LOVE LIVES,
YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS,

00:34.533 --> 00:37.067
THE LITTLE JOYS AND TRAGEDIES
THAT MAKE YOU WHO YOU ARE

00:37.100 --> 00:38.833
HAVE NO PLACE IN MY HOSPITAL.

00:38.867 --> 00:42.067
THIS IS OUR SON.
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.633
***

00:47.667 --> 00:51.400
(Meredith) WE GOT INTO MEDICINE
BECAUSE WE WANT TO SAVE LIVES.

00:51.433 --> 00:56.067
WE GO INTO MEDICINE
BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO GOOD.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.133
WE GO INTO MEDICINE
FOR THE RUSH,

00:59.167 --> 01:01.067
FOR THE HIGH,

01:01.100 --> 01:02.733
FOR THE RIDE.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.800
YOU'RE NOT DANCING.
I'M TOO TENSE TO DANCE.

01:04.833 --> 01:07.433
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE DANCING.
MY PROBLEM IS,

01:07.467 --> 01:09.433
I'M SLEEPING WITH A MAN
WHO'S DATING.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.067
AND I DON'T CARE
IF HE DATES SYDNEY.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.267
UGH.
IT'S THE WOMAN
HE DATES AFTER SYDNEY,

01:13.300 --> 01:15.300
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.300
AND IF I HAD ANY SENSE AT ALL,

01:17.333 --> 01:19.767
I WOULD BREAK UP
WITH THE BREAKUP SEX.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.767
THERE WOULD BE
NO MORE BREAKUP SEXING.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.833
IF I HAD ANY SENSE--
SHUT UP! DANCE IT OUT.

01:23.867 --> 01:26.800
BUT WHAT WE REMEMBER
AT THE END OF MOST DAYS

01:26.833 --> 01:29.600
ARE THE LOSSES.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.733
WHAT WE LAY AWAKE
AT NIGHT REPLAYING IS...

01:31.767 --> 01:34.800
THE PAIN WE CAUSED
OR FAILED TO CURE,

01:34.833 --> 01:37.667
THE LIVES WE RUINED
OR FAILED TO SAVE.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.633
YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA TELL HIM.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.233
I DON'T WANT HIM
SEEING OTHER PEOPLE.

01:43.267 --> 01:44.533
GOOD. FINE. WHATEVER.

01:44.567 --> 01:47.833
I'M GONNA TELL HIM,
AND I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

01:47.867 --> 01:50.033
DANCING MAKES YOU BRAVE.

01:50.067 --> 01:51.800
***

01:51.833 --> 01:54.067
SO THE EXPERIENCE
OF PRACTICING MEDICINE

01:54.100 --> 01:56.600
RARELY RESEMBLES THE GOAL.

01:56.633 --> 02:00.333
THE EXPERIENCE, TOO OFTEN,
IS ASS-BACKWARDS

02:00.367 --> 02:03.467
AND UPSIDE DOWN.

02:05.467 --> 02:08.100
HEY.
I AM SO SICK OF MEREDITH
AND CRISTINA

02:08.133 --> 02:10.033
AND THEIR STUPID LOVE AFFAIR
WITH EACH OTHER

02:10.067 --> 02:11.800
THAT THEY HAVE TO RUB
IN EVERYONE'S FACES.

02:11.833 --> 02:14.600
IT'S--STUPID DANCING.
FRIGGIN' BOBBSEY TWINS.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.700
STUPID.
(laughs) YOU'RE RANTING.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.700
IT'S KINDA EARLY
IN THE MORNING FOR RANTING.

02:18.733 --> 02:20.633
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE HAPPY ONES.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.633
WE SHOULD BE DANCING, GEORGE.
WHY AREN'T WE DANCING?

02:22.667 --> 02:24.667
YOU WANT TO DANCE?

02:24.700 --> 02:27.333
WHATEVER. (sighs)

02:27.367 --> 02:28.567
I'M GONNA GO IN EARLY.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.167
I'M GONNA GET ON HARD-CORE
ERICA HAHN CARDIO,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.100
AND I'M GONNA KICK ASS AT IT.

02:33.133 --> 02:35.800
AND WHEN I KICK ASS AT CARDIO,
IT'S GONNA PISS CRISTINA OFF,

02:35.833 --> 02:38.700
BUT IT WON'T MATTER, BECAUSE
I'LL BE A KICK-ASS CARDIO GOD.

02:38.733 --> 02:40.067
(door closes)

02:40.100 --> 02:43.733
***

02:45.367 --> 02:47.433
I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU'RE NEVER HERE.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.100
J--HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

02:49.133 --> 02:51.033
I MESS UP
THE ROTATION SCHEDULE,

02:51.067 --> 02:53.200
THE RESIDENTS ARE GONNA
DOG ME ALL WEEK.

02:53.233 --> 02:54.267
OKAY.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.833
YOU'RE NEVER HERE.

02:55.867 --> 02:57.267
I'M HERE IN THE MORNINGS.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.100
I'M HERE AT NIGHT.

02:59.133 --> 03:01.733
YOU'RE HERE BETWEEN
MIDNIGHT AND 6:00 A.M.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.533
I'M CHIEF RESIDENT NOW--

03:03.567 --> 03:06.567
AND I'M LOADING
THE DISHWASHER!

03:14.067 --> 03:16.467
(whispers) HI.

03:19.167 --> 03:22.133
YOU VOLUNTEERED

03:22.167 --> 03:25.733
TO STAY HOME
WITH T-U-C-K.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.667
WHO ELSE WAS GONNA
TAKE CARE OF T-U-C-K?

03:28.700 --> 03:31.500
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

03:31.533 --> 03:33.200
OKAY.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.400
HEY, HONEY.
WE NEED TO TALK.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.067
OKAY.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.833
UH, TAKE THE BABY
BY YOUR MOM,

03:38.867 --> 03:40.767
AND MEET ME
FOR LUNCH, OKAY?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.167
WE'LL TALK THEN.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.100
WELL, WHY CAN'T WE
TALK HERE?

03:44.133 --> 03:46.100
'CAUSE I'M ONLY HERE
BETWEEN THE HOURS

03:46.133 --> 03:47.333
OF MIDNIGHT AND 6:00 A.M.

03:47.367 --> 03:48.767
NOW COME ON.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.700
NOW JUST MEET ME
FOR LUNCH, TUCKER.

03:50.733 --> 03:52.633
COME ON NOW.

03:52.667 --> 03:53.633
LUNCH.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.733
YES, LUNCH.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.633
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

04:01.167 --> 04:03.133
(Meredith)
THATCHER'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.333
HE CAN GET DRUNK
ALL HE WANTS. I DON'T CARE.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.267
RIGHT.
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT LEXIE, EITHER.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.400
SHE'S A BIG GIRL.
SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.333
YOU TALK ABOUT THEM
AN AWFUL LOT

04:11.367 --> 04:13.100
FOR SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T CARE.

04:13.133 --> 04:14.633
YOU CARE

04:14.667 --> 04:17.433
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.267
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME LATE
FOR MY MEETING WITH SLOAN.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.433
WELL, OKAY THEN, GO.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.367
WHAT?

04:34.733 --> 04:38.667
NOTHING.
I'M... GONNA BE LATE.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.500
HEY.

04:44.533 --> 04:45.733
I'M LATE
FOR SLOAN'S MEETING.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.400
YEAH, SO AM I.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.433
ALSO,
I'M NOT SPEAKING TO YOU.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.800
I'M STILL
NOT SPEAKING TO YOU.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.300
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK.

05:04.333 --> 05:07.233
LATE FOR SLOAN.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.300
(sighs)

05:09.333 --> 05:11.633
OKAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS NICK HANSCOMB.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.033
HI.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.767
NICK WAS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE ME REMOVE

05:14.800 --> 05:16.700
A LARGE CAROTID BODY TUMOR
FROM HIS NECK.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.600
THE FACT THAT I WAS ABLE
TO GET CLEAN BOUNDARIES

05:19.633 --> 05:21.767
IS PRETTY DARN IMPRESSIVE,
EVEN FOR ME.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.700
CONGRATULATIONS.
DON'T INTERRUPT.

05:23.733 --> 05:26.700
NOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS
A WILDLY SUCCESSFUL SURGERY,

05:26.733 --> 05:29.733
WE HAD TO DISSECT OUT
DEEP LYMPH NODES IN HIS NECK.

05:29.767 --> 05:32.400
THERE IS NOW ONLY
A DELICATE FLAP OF SKIN

05:32.433 --> 05:35.267
BETWEEN HIS CAROTID ARTERY
AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.467
THAT SAID,
WHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.833
I WOULD THINK GIVEN
THE FRIABILITY OF THE SKIN,

05:39.867 --> 05:41.233
THAT THERE'S
A GREAT POSSIBILITY

05:41.267 --> 05:43.133
THAT THE, UM,
THE ARTERY COULD BLOW?

05:43.167 --> 05:44.633
RIGHT.
(doctors murmuring)

05:44.667 --> 05:47.167
OH, DON'T WORRY. I'VE--
I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.067
IF THAT HAPPENS,
WHOEVER'S IN THE ROOM,

05:49.100 --> 05:52.367
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A DOCTOR,
A NURSE, AN ORDERLY,

05:52.400 --> 05:55.133
YOUR JOB
IS TO STOP THE BLEEDING

05:55.167 --> 05:56.667
THEN PAGE ME,
IN THAT ORDER.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.467
ARE WE CLEAR?
ANY QUESTIONS?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.800
THEY LOOK SCARED.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.167
THEY'RE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS,
NICK.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.100
A HEALTHY LEVEL OF FEAR
IS ENCOURAGED.

06:05.133 --> 06:06.633
OKAY, THEN.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.267
UH, IF I DO DIE,

06:08.300 --> 06:11.433
IT WILL HAVE BEEN LOVELY
MEETING YOU ALL.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.600
SEE?
THE PATIENT IS CONFIDENT.

06:13.633 --> 06:16.500
YOU SHOULD BE CONFIDENT.
THAT'S IT.

06:16.533 --> 06:18.300
(Miranda) WHAT DO WE GOT?

06:18.333 --> 06:20.367
JACOB NOLSTON, 47,

06:20.400 --> 06:22.500
STATUS POST A DOUBLE BYPASS
SURGERY TWO WEEKS AGO,

06:22.533 --> 06:24.233
NOW PRESENTS FEBRILE

06:24.267 --> 06:26.233
WITH PAIN AND TENDERNESS
IN HIS SURGICAL INCISIONS.

06:26.267 --> 06:28.167
WE GOT A 10-CAR PILEUP
ON THE FREEWAY.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.367
YOU MIND TAKING HIM
FROM HERE?
OH, YOU GOT IT.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.500
(Callie) OKAY, I NEED A GURNEY
FOR THE TRANSFER.
(Izzie and Cristina)
I'LL PAGE HAHN.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.733
SOUNDS LIKE WE ALL AGREE.
GET HIM INSIDE AND FLIP FOR IT.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.467
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS,
MR. NOLSTON.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.267
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.
(Cristina)
ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.533
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD?
(Izzie)
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE

06:41.567 --> 06:44.433
THAT YOU DON'T OWN
THE CARDIO DEPARTMENT?
HE'S MY PATIENT.
I GOT HERE FIRST. DIBS.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.600
(Meredith) HEY, YOU GUYS.
YOU CAN'T CALL DIBS
ON A HUMAN BEING.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.767
YOU GUYS,
I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE.
LET GO OF THE GURNEY.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.467
YOU LET GO.
MOVE!

06:50.500 --> 06:53.133
(siren wails)

07:08.533 --> 07:11.267
(screams) AH, MY LEG!

07:11.300 --> 07:13.200
YOU OKAY?
I'M GOOD. LET'S GO.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.733
AAH! AAH!

07:15.767 --> 07:17.133
(Miranda)
CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT!

07:17.167 --> 07:18.767
GET SOME GURNEYS OUT HERE!

07:21.833 --> 07:24.500
(moans softly)

07:24.533 --> 07:27.300
RAY.
RAY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

07:27.333 --> 07:30.100
STAN?

07:30.133 --> 07:31.433
(Ray) STAN?

07:31.467 --> 07:34.267
OH, MY GOD.
STAN, OPEN YOUR EYES, MAN.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.800
(breath catches)

07:39.633 --> 07:42.767
OH, MAN.
DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.267
LET'S GET YOU GUYS
OUTTA THERE.
NO, STOP. STOP.
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.267
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL
FIRE STABILIZES THE RIG.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.633
THESE DOORS
AREN'T GONNA BUDGE.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.500
UH, TORRES, I NEED
YOUR HELP HERE! GET THE DRIVER.
OKAY, ON MY WAY.

07:52.533 --> 07:55.133
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
JUST PAGE SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU

07:55.167 --> 07:57.167
AND KEEP THEM TALKING.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.133
YOU GOT THIS?
YEAH.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.533
DON'T LEAVE.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.767
DON'T.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.333
OKAY.
SOMEBODY PAGE THE CHIEF.

08:08.367 --> 08:10.267
(groans)

08:10.300 --> 08:12.700
HEY, YOU OKAY?

08:12.733 --> 08:16.433
NO, BUT I'M NOT AS BAD OFF
AS THIS GUY.

08:16.467 --> 08:19.267
HE STARTED CODING
AFTER WE PICKED HIM UP.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.267
M-MARY HAD SOME KIND
OF SEIZURE.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.100
MARY? MARY, COME ON, GIRL.
WAKE UP.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.600
I NEED SOME HELP HERE.

08:25.633 --> 08:27.533
THERE'S NO PULSE.
WE'LL CALL THE CORONER.

08:27.567 --> 08:28.767
LET ME CHECK YOUR INJURIES.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.633
NO. IS SHE DEAD?

08:30.667 --> 08:32.033
NO, BUT SHE LOOKS
POSTICTAL.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.800
SHE'S ALSO GOT
A BAD ELBOW DISLOCATION

08:33.833 --> 08:35.433
AND A WEAK PULSE.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.300
SHE WAS DRIVING,
SHE WAS TALKING TO ME.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.900
SHE JUST STARTED CONVULSING,

08:38.933 --> 08:42.300
AND THEN WE SLAMMED
INTO THAT OTHER RIG.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU THINK YOU CAN MOVE?

08:42.333 --> 08:45.200
YEAH.
UH... HEY, NOW YOU KNOW
I NEED TO STABILIZE YOU.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.133
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
MY C-SPINE'S CLEAR.
I CAN--I CAN WALK.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.833
WELL, COME ON.
WHERE ARE YOU INJURED?

08:50.867 --> 08:52.767
MY GUT. UPPER ABDOMEN.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.200
(grunts) LISTEN, I KNOW
THIS IS GONNA SOUND WEIRD,

08:56.233 --> 08:59.367
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
GET ME A GUY DOCTOR?

09:01.367 --> 09:03.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:03.367 --> 09:05.700
HOW AM I DOING?

09:05.733 --> 09:07.267
STRONG AND STABLE.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.600
STRONG AND STABLE--

09:08.633 --> 09:11.133
TWO WORDS THAT HAVE NEVER
BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE ME,

09:11.167 --> 09:13.167
EVER.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.533
YOU'RE A PRETTY GIRL.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.667
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S RUDE.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.600
I'M JUST--
I HAVEN'T BEEN ALLOWED

09:20.633 --> 09:23.400
TO NOTICE THAT KIND OF THING
FOR A WHILE AND...

09:23.433 --> 09:24.633
NOW I'M ALLOWED.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.567
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO NOTICE PRETTINESS?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.700
WELL, I'M ALLOWED TO NOTICE,
UH, OTHER WOMEN,

09:29.733 --> 09:32.033
WOMEN OTHER THAN
MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.533
MY NOW, UH, EX-GIRLFRIEND.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.067
OH, I'M SORRY.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.733
(beep)
YEAH, GIANT NECK TUMORS
WEREN'T HER THING.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.733
SHE LEFT YOU
BECAUSE OF THE TUMOR?

09:40.767 --> 09:42.667
OF COURSE NOT. NO.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.467
SHE LEFT ME BECAUSE, UH,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.400
I DIDN'T
MAKE HER LAUGH ANYMORE,

09:46.433 --> 09:50.400
AND, UH, SHE HAD JUST LOST

10:20.800 --> 10:23.567

A VAPID NARCISSIST.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.500
BUT THEN IT TURNED OUT

10:25.533 --> 10:27.733
SHE REALLY WAS
JUST A VAPID NARCISSIST.

10:27.767 --> 10:28.833
OUCH.

HAD A SEIZURE BEFORE.

13:33.367 --> 13:35.667
I MEAN, I'M FINE,

13:35.700 --> 13:38.633

AND YOU CAN SCRUB IN?
THANK YOU.

19:26.767 --> 19:29.100
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:29.133 --> 19:32.800
***

19:32.833 --> 19:35.700
I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.767
SO... COFFEE?

19:37.800 --> 19:40.600
UGH. I CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T?

19:40.633 --> 19:42.533
WHEN I WAS YOUR PATIENT,
YOU MADE TIME FOR ME.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.433
'CAUSE YOU WERE MY PATIENT.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.367
AND HERE I THOUGHT
IT WAS 'CAUSE YOU LIKED ME.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.567
LOOK, I'M--
I'M REALLY SORRY.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.400
I GOTTA FINISH UP
WITH THIS PATIENT,

19:49.433 --> 19:51.333
AND THEN I'M SCRUBBING IN
ON A SURGERY,

19:51.367 --> 19:53.233
AND IT'S ONE
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
CAN I WATCH?

19:53.267 --> 19:55.167
WHAT?
CAN I WATCH THE--
THE SURGERY?

19:55.200 --> 19:57.067
CAN I--
CAN YOU SNEAK ME IN?

19:57.100 --> 19:59.133
NO. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE
I'D GET IN FOR THAT?

19:59.167 --> 20:01.500
COME ON. SINCE WHEN
ARE YOU A RULE FOLLOWER?

20:01.533 --> 20:04.400
THERE'S ALWAYS A DOZEN PEOPLE
IN THE BACK OF THE O.R.

20:04.433 --> 20:06.367
AND THERE'S A GALLERY.
AVA.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.500
PLEASE.

20:07.533 --> 20:10.600
***

20:12.800 --> 20:14.433
WE'RE READY TO GO.

20:14.467 --> 20:16.667
HOLD OFF FOR A MOMENT.
HIS WIFE'S ARRIVING.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.200
STAN, SARA'S HERE.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.067
STAN.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.833
STAN, WAKE UP, MAN.
SARA'S HERE.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.700
WAKE UP!

20:24.733 --> 20:26.600
***

20:26.633 --> 20:29.400
THAT'S GOOD.

20:29.433 --> 20:32.033
THAT'S GOOD.
BABY?

20:32.067 --> 20:33.233
BABY.

20:33.267 --> 20:36.133
HEY.

20:36.167 --> 20:38.067
(Callie)
YOUR X-RAY SHOWS

20:38.100 --> 20:39.833
THAT THE METAL'S
EMBEDDED IN YOUR FEMUR,

20:39.867 --> 20:41.767
SO I'M GONNA GO IN
AND REMOVE IT

20:41.800 --> 20:44.067
WHILE DR. HAHN AND DR. SLOAN
REPAIR THE DAMAGE

20:44.100 --> 20:46.633
CAUSED BY THE INFECTION.
REPAIR THE DAMAGE?

20:46.667 --> 20:47.733
MM-HMM.

20:47.767 --> 20:49.533
THEY'RE REMOVING
MY CHEST BONE.

20:49.567 --> 20:52.133
WHY IS THIS ALL HAPPENING?

20:52.167 --> 20:55.467
MY KIDS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
SEE ME THIS WAY.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.800
IT'S A DAD'S JOB
TO WORRY.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.333
YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS.

20:59.367 --> 21:02.233
YOU... WORRY ABOUT 'EM
EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.

21:02.267 --> 21:05.133
BUT THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DAD.

21:05.167 --> 21:08.167
THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO
HAVE TO COMFORT THEIR MOM.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.133
(crying)
WHY AM I BACK HERE?

21:11.167 --> 21:13.467
MY KIDS--
(Izzie) YOUR KIDS ARE FINE.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.267
THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF
EACH OTHER, AND THEY'RE FINE.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.067
HUH.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.133
LUCY WAS HUNGRY,
AND THE OTHERS WERE, TOO,

21:20.167 --> 21:22.167
SO YOUR WIFE TOOK THEM
TO THE CAFETERIA.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.733
THE POINT IS, THEY'RE FINE.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.167
THEY JUST WANT THEIR DAD
TO GET BETTER.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.100
YOU'LL KEEP AN EYE ON 'EM?

21:29.133 --> 21:31.033
WHEN I'M IN SURGERY,
YOU'LL KEEP THEM UPDATED?

21:31.067 --> 21:33.733
'CAUSE MY WIFE, SHE, UH...

21:33.767 --> 21:37.567
HUH, SHE GETS PANICKY IF SHE
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.500
I WILL KEEP HER UPDATED.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.800
UH, I WOULD LIKE TO BORROW
DR. YANG.

21:44.833 --> 21:46.733
IT'S IMPORTANT.
CAN YOU SPARE HER?

21:46.767 --> 21:49.233
TORRES, CAN I STEAL
STEVENS OFF YOUR SERVICE?

21:49.267 --> 21:51.233
(scoffs) I'LL GIVE HER AWAY
FOR FREE.

21:51.267 --> 21:53.133
YANG'S ALL YOURS,
DR. BAILEY.

21:53.167 --> 21:54.667
THANK YOU.

21:54.700 --> 21:55.800
YANG, STEVENS.

21:55.833 --> 21:59.433
DR. YANG, DR. BAILEY HAS
REQUESTED YOUR CAPABLE HANDS.

21:59.467 --> 22:02.233
DR. STEVENS, TAKE OVER PREPPING
MR. NOLSTON FOR SURGERY.

22:02.267 --> 22:03.467
BUT WHAT--WAIT--

22:03.500 --> 22:07.500
OH, JUST TAKE IT UP
WITH DR. BAILEY, YANG.

22:07.533 --> 22:09.300
HEY.

22:09.333 --> 22:11.367
HEY.
MARY'S SCANS COME UP YET?

22:11.400 --> 22:13.200
(George) NOT YET.

22:13.233 --> 22:15.633
MM.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.833
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND STEVENS?

22:18.867 --> 22:20.800
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T SLEEP
IN YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE

22:20.833 --> 22:23.467
DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T HEAR THE GOSSIP.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.633
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS?
WE DON'T TALK...

22:25.667 --> 22:27.367
OH, YOU'RE...

22:27.400 --> 22:29.400
YOU MISS MEREDITH
AND YOU'RE CLINGING.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.333
I'M NOT CLINGING.
OH, A LITTLE BIT,
YOU'RE CLINGING.

22:32.367 --> 22:35.200
NO, I'M JUST MAKING
SMALL TALK.
AH, UM, OKAY.

22:35.233 --> 22:36.400
(computer beeps)

22:36.433 --> 22:38.100
HERE WE GO.

22:38.133 --> 22:41.133
(beeping and whirring)

22:43.800 --> 22:46.333
TUMOR.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.200
(sighs)

22:48.233 --> 22:50.100
(grunts)

22:50.133 --> 22:52.400
LOOK, I'M HURT.
I'M--I'M REALLY HURT HERE.

22:52.433 --> 22:54.333
YOU JUST LIE THERE
AND TRY NOT TO DIE.

22:54.367 --> 22:55.533
SOMEONE WILL BE HERE SOON

22:55.567 --> 22:57.467
TO SAVE THE MASTER RACE
FROM EXTINCTION.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.233
OH, OKAY.
DR. BAILEY, CAN I
TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?

23:00.267 --> 23:02.733
I MEAN NO DISRESPECT,
BUT CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME

23:02.767 --> 23:04.567
YOU HAVE
AN AMAZINGLY GOOD REASON

23:04.600 --> 23:06.733
FOR PULLING ME OFF
OF DR. HAHN'S SERVICE

23:06.767 --> 23:09.567
WHEN YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING TOOTH AND NAIL

23:09.600 --> 23:12.600
TO GET INTO HER GOOD GRACES?
YOU'RE NOT BLACK.
BUT YOU'RE NOT WHITE EITHER.

23:12.633 --> 23:15.833
DR. YANG
WILL BE EXAMINING YOU.

23:15.867 --> 23:18.800
OH, COME ON.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

23:18.833 --> 23:20.667
OKAY,
YOU HAVE MEDICAL TRAINING.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.800
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE TO LIVE

23:22.833 --> 23:25.133
IF YOU HAVE INTERNAL INJURIES?
EXACTLY.

23:25.167 --> 23:28.233
I SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND YOU LET
THIS FINE DOCTOR EXAMINE YOU.

23:28.267 --> 23:31.633
DR. YANG, GIVE HIM THE BEST
MEDICAL TREATMENT POSSIBLE.

23:31.667 --> 23:33.567
IT'S THE LAW.

23:33.600 --> 23:37.433
SIR, I NEED YOU
TO MOVE YOUR HANDS.

23:37.467 --> 23:39.600
(grunts)

23:39.633 --> 23:42.267
NO.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.467
LOOK, I-I JUST
DIDN'T WANT HER TO SEE.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.000
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT
TAKE OFFENSE, YOU KNOW?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.067
***

24:02.300 --> 24:04.200
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU.
I'M NOT.

24:04.233 --> 24:06.300
I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
RIGHT NOW WITHOUT YOU.

24:06.333 --> 24:07.500
OKAY? PLEASE.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.433
I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER BEFORE.

24:09.467 --> 24:10.767
WHAT?

24:10.800 --> 24:12.133
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

24:12.167 --> 24:14.633
I'VE WORKED IN THIS HOSPITAL
ALL THIS TIME,

24:14.667 --> 24:17.633
AND BEFORE TODAY, SHE WAS
A COMPLETE STRANGER TO ME.

24:17.667 --> 24:20.633
IT HAPPENS.
IT'S A BIG HOSPITAL.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.067
(crying)

24:23.100 --> 24:25.800
I'VE NEVER MET HER BEFORE,
AND YET, I'M THE PERSON

24:25.833 --> 24:28.533
WHO HANDED HER
THE WORST DAY OF HER LIFE.

24:28.567 --> 24:32.767
IN HER STORY,
THAT'S WHO I AM.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.700
THAT'S WHO I'LL ALWAYS BE.

24:34.733 --> 24:38.133
***

24:38.167 --> 24:41.100
THAT'S THE JOB.

24:41.133 --> 24:45.033
(sighs) THAT'S THE JOB.
I KNOW.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.567
LOOK AT ME.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.533
***

24:49.567 --> 24:51.400
THIS DAY,

24:51.433 --> 24:53.467
THIS DAY YOU FEEL HELPLESS.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.400
THIS DAY
MAKES ALL THOSE OTHER DAYS

24:55.433 --> 24:58.767
WHEN YOU FIGHT TO SAVE A LIFE
AND LOSE...

24:58.800 --> 25:01.133
THIS DAY MAKES YOU GRATEFUL

25:01.167 --> 25:05.167
YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.767
YOU TAKE IT IN.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.633
***

25:09.667 --> 25:11.300
(Sara crying) I'M OKAY.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.233
I'M OKAY.

25:13.267 --> 25:16.133
(crying
and speaking indistinctly)

25:16.167 --> 25:18.800
***

25:18.833 --> 25:20.733
HE'S ALIVE!

25:20.767 --> 25:24.367
(sobbing)

25:24.400 --> 25:26.300
***

25:26.333 --> 25:27.833
IT'S TIME.

25:27.867 --> 25:31.033
***

25:33.800 --> 25:35.533
(groans)

25:35.567 --> 25:37.400
CAN YOU GO EASY?
I'M INJURED HERE.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.333
YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF MORPHINE.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

25:39.367 --> 25:42.033
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE IN
A CONCENTRATION CAMP

25:42.067 --> 25:43.233
OR ANYTHING.

25:43.267 --> 25:45.167
YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE
ARE YOUNG OR--OR DRUNK,

25:45.200 --> 25:46.700
THEY GET TATTOOS.

25:46.733 --> 25:49.200
THEY WAKE UP TO REGRET IT.
OH, SO YOU REGRET IT?

25:49.233 --> 25:51.833
***

25:51.867 --> 25:53.767
YOU GOTTA TREAT ME
LIKE ANYONE ELSE.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.767
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THIS COUNTRY.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.267
OH, YES, IT IS.

25:59.300 --> 26:02.100
***

26:02.133 --> 26:03.400
SO...

26:03.433 --> 26:06.267
YOU'RE GONNA DRILL
INTO MY SKULL?

26:06.300 --> 26:07.800
O'MALLEY.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.300
DR. SHEPHERD'S GONNA DO WHAT
WE CALL A COOKIE CRANIOTOMY.

26:10.333 --> 26:13.767
UH, HE'S GONNA DRILL
A VERY, VERY SMALL HOLE,

26:13.800 --> 26:14.867
AND THEN WITH A COMPUTER,

26:14.900 --> 26:17.400
HE'S GOING TO GUIDE
THE SCOPE THROUGH YOUR BRAIN.

26:17.433 --> 26:18.833
IT'S AS MINIMALLY INVASIVE
AS POSSIBLE.

26:18.867 --> 26:20.533
(Derek) MM-HMM.

26:20.567 --> 26:22.467
IT'S JUST--
IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW,

26:22.500 --> 26:25.133
TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF ALL THIS.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.400
HOW ARE STAN AND RAY...

26:27.433 --> 26:29.067
AND SHANE?

26:29.100 --> 26:33.200
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

26:33.233 --> 26:34.700
(inhales sharply)

26:34.733 --> 26:36.700
SHE'S SEIZING.

26:42.733 --> 26:44.767
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE AN ASS,

26:44.800 --> 26:48.200
BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU BROUGHT
JANE DOE INTO THE GALLERY?

26:48.233 --> 26:51.400
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET YOURSELF
KICKED OUT OF THE PROGRAM?
SHE WANTED TO SEE WHAT I DO.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.333
MM-HMM. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SEEING LEXIE.

26:53.367 --> 26:55.433
I'M A POPULAR GUY.

26:55.467 --> 26:57.367
I'M SURE
WHATEVER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

26:57.400 --> 26:59.033
IS ENDLESSLY FASCINATING,
DR. KAREV,

26:59.067 --> 27:01.267
BUT I KIND OF HAD MY HEART SET
ON SAVING A LIFE TODAY.

27:01.300 --> 27:02.600
SORRY.

27:02.633 --> 27:05.233
(Erica) SO... LET'S BEGIN.

27:07.833 --> 27:11.167
HEY. NURSE OLIVIA SAID
YOU NEEDED TO SEE ME.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.367
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:12.400 --> 27:15.600
MY BOOK IS BAD,
AND I HATE DAYTIME TELEVISION,

27:15.633 --> 27:18.133
AND ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE AT WORK.

27:18.167 --> 27:20.833
YEAH, WELL, I'M AT WORK, TOO.
I'M AN INTERN.

27:20.867 --> 27:23.133
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
LEARNING THINGS.
YOU CAN--YOU CAN LEARN
ABOUT MY ARTERY.

27:23.167 --> 27:25.733
YOU CAN NEVER KNOW TOO MUCH
ABOUT ARTERIES, RIGHT?

27:25.767 --> 27:28.533
COME ON. I HAVE NO ONE
TO TALK TO.

27:28.567 --> 27:30.733
FINE, BUT I'M TAKING
YOUR VITALS AGAIN.

27:30.767 --> 27:32.333
OKAY.

27:32.367 --> 27:35.233
SO, UH, YOU WANT TO HELP ME
PLOT MY REVENGE?

27:35.267 --> 27:36.433
GIRLFRIEND?

27:36.467 --> 27:38.600
UH-HUH.
HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING--

27:38.633 --> 27:41.333
I PAGE HER HERE,
AND THEN, UH, YOU KNOW,

27:41.367 --> 27:44.033
I'M ALL, LIKE, "I'M DYING,

27:44.067 --> 27:48.600
AND I JUST NEED TO GAZE
AT YOUR BEAUTY ONE LAST TIME,"

27:48.633 --> 27:50.367
AND THEN--
AND THEN SHE GETS HERE,

27:50.400 --> 27:52.300
AND I FLASH HER THE ARTERY.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.300
IT'S MEAN.
RIGHT?

27:54.333 --> 27:56.567
(laughs) I LIKE IT.
OKAY.
CAN YOU GET ME A PHONE?

27:58.267 --> 28:01.100
GENTLEMEN, THE MOMENT
THEY PULL APART THE RIG,

28:01.133 --> 28:03.833
WE'RE GONNA COME IN
AND GRAB YOU.
YOU TAKE STAN, FIRST.

28:03.867 --> 28:05.767
ONCE WE GET IN THERE
AND ASSESS,

28:05.800 --> 28:07.700
THEN WE'LL SEE
WHO GOES FIRST.

28:07.733 --> 28:09.233
NO, YOU TAKE STAN FIRST.

28:09.267 --> 28:11.200
YOU TAKE STAN FIRST.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.700
RAY...

28:12.733 --> 28:15.567
I THINK I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.367
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE BETTER.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.600
DON'T YOU SCREW WITH ME.

28:19.633 --> 28:23.200
NO. NO, I'M PROBABLY NOT
AS BAD AS I THINK.

28:23.233 --> 28:26.367
I'M PROBABLY JUST PARALYZED.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.133
RICHARD... YOU THINK MAYBE

28:29.167 --> 28:34.067
THAT I CAN GET OUT OF HERE
JUST PARALYZED, RIGHT?

28:34.100 --> 28:38.067
***

28:40.567 --> 28:43.267
IT'S POSSIBLE. IT HAPPENS.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.200
REALLY?

28:45.233 --> 28:46.600
SEE?

28:46.633 --> 28:49.567
O-OKAY.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.800
OKAY.

28:51.833 --> 28:54.600
***

28:54.633 --> 28:57.700
IS MY WIFE INSIDE?

28:57.733 --> 28:59.433
SHE WON'T SEE ANY OF THIS?

28:59.467 --> 29:01.367
NO.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.833
YOU'LL BE
WHERE I CAN LOOK AT YOU?

29:03.867 --> 29:06.833
I'M RIGHT HERE,
WHERE YOU CAN LOOK AT ME.

29:06.867 --> 29:10.700

29:36.533 --> 29:38.833
STOP. STOP.

29:38.867 --> 29:42.200
STOP! STOP! MAKE THEM STOP!

29:45.133 --> 29:47.233
STOP! STOP!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

29:47.267 --> 29:49.167
IT'S STAN!

29:49.200 --> 29:51.767
RAY... (groans)
RAY'S BACK...

29:51.800 --> 29:53.600
IT'S IN DEEP.

29:53.633 --> 29:56.000
HE'LL BLEED OUT
IF YOU MOVE US.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
IT'S THE OXYGEN REGULATOR.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.233
IT'S EMBEDDED IN HIS BACK.

30:03.267 --> 30:05.067
RAY!

30:05.100 --> 30:07.600
RAY, YOU STILL WITH US?

30:09.200 --> 30:11.633
I'M HERE, CHIEF.
I'M STILL HERE.

30:11.667 --> 30:13.567
BUT MY PULSE IS WEAK.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.767
(grunts)

30:15.800 --> 30:18.800
OKAY, HE'S SWEATY
AND BREATHING FAST,

30:18.833 --> 30:21.633
AND WITH THE ANGLE
OF THAT REGULATOR...

30:21.667 --> 30:23.500
IT'S CARDIAC TAMPONADE.

30:23.533 --> 30:26.133
IF THAT REGULATOR
CAUSED A TEAR IN HIS HEART

30:26.167 --> 30:29.200
AND WE MOVE HIM,
THE REGULATOR COULD MOVE.

30:29.233 --> 30:31.733
IT'LL MAKE THE TEAR BIGGER.

30:31.767 --> 30:34.633
PLEASE LET'S DON'T
FLOOD MY HEART.

30:34.667 --> 30:35.733
PLEASE.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.067
WE'LL STABILIZE HIM
IN THE AMBULANCE.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.533
STAN...

30:39.567 --> 30:41.467
YOU'RE A HERO, MAN.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.800
YOU SAVED RAY'S LIFE.

30:45.333 --> 30:47.600
STAN?

30:47.633 --> 30:51.367
STAN? STAN?

30:51.400 --> 30:55.100
DAMN IT, STAN. STAN.

GO GET THE ULTRASOUND

31:01.133 --> 31:03.200
SO WE CAN BE SURE,

31:03.233 --> 31:05.133
AND BRING A CRASH CART
JUST IN CASE,

31:05.167 --> 31:07.033
AND GO FIND
WHERE HAHN IS.

31:07.067 --> 31:09.267

31:09.300 --> 31:11.200
HEY.
FILMS ARE UP.

31:11.233 --> 31:13.433
YEAH, THERE'S
INTRAPERITONEAL BLEEDING.

31:13.467 --> 31:14.633
HIS LIVER LOOKS
COMPLETELY RUPTURED.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.433
YEAH, HE'S GONNA NEED
A LAPAROTOMY,

31:16.467 --> 31:18.300
BUT MAYBE IT'LL BE
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

31:18.333 --> 31:21.033
OH, SO I CAN GET BACK
TO HAHN'S SERVICE?

31:21.067 --> 31:22.267
OR NOT?

31:22.300 --> 31:25.633
NO. IF I HAVE TO WORK
ON THIS MAN, SO DO YOU.

31:25.667 --> 31:29.367
WHY? YOU DON'T NEED ME.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.600
HE HAS A SWASTIKA
ON HIS ABDOMEN,

31:32.633 --> 31:34.233
A GIANT BLACK SWASTIKA.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.500
MY STEPFATHER'S PARENTS
DIED IN AUSCHWITZ.

31:40.367 --> 31:42.133

31:42.167 --> 31:45.833
OKAY.
YOU AND I WILL DO THIS.

31:45.867 --> 31:48.267
WE WILL DO THIS
AND WE WILL CONSIDER OURSELVES

31:48.300 --> 31:50.733
HAVING RISEN ABOVE.

31:50.767 --> 31:53.067

SAVE IT.
(mutters softly)

32:13.733 --> 32:16.100
(Erica) YOU'RE USING A CABLE
INSTEAD OF WIRES, DR. SLOAN.

32:16.133 --> 32:18.233
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT
DONE THAT WAY BEFORE.

32:18.267 --> 32:20.600
TENSION BANDING.
LEARNED IT BACK IN NEW YORK.

32:20.633 --> 32:24.533
I MOVED THERE AFTER COLUMBIA
TO STUDY UNDER JOHN SEEVER.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.067
HE WAS A GREAT SURGEON.

32:27.100 --> 32:28.833
HE DIED LAST YEAR.

32:28.867 --> 32:31.733
I WAS WRECKED,
COULDN'T SLEEP FOR WEEKS.

32:31.767 --> 32:33.767
IT WAS LIKE LOSING
MY OWN FATHER.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.700
WHAT,
ARE WE ON A DATE HERE?

32:35.733 --> 32:38.667
I WAS COMPLIMENTING
YOUR SURGICAL SKILLS, DR. SLOAN,

32:38.700 --> 32:41.600
NOT LOOKING FOR A WINDOW
INTO YOUR WOUNDED SOUL.
(laughs)

32:41.633 --> 32:42.667
CLAMP, PLEASE.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.733
YOU CAN'T OPERATE.
I WON'T SIGN THE CONSENT FORM.

32:45.767 --> 32:48.167
YOU NEED THE SURGERY.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.367
YOU WILL DIE
WITHOUT THE SURGERY.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.433
YOU MAY DIE WITH THE SURGERY,
BUT YOUR CHANCE OF LIVING

32:53.467 --> 32:55.767
IS GREATLY INCREASED
IF YOU LET ME OPERATE.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.767
AND IT'S JUST GONNA BE
YOU TWO IN THERE?
YES.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.467
NO. I NEED TO HAVE
AT LEAST ONE WHITE DOCTOR

33:01.500 --> 33:02.667
IN THAT OPERATING ROOM

33:02.700 --> 33:05.300
SO YOU DON'T KILL ME
ON THE TABLE.

33:05.333 --> 33:06.467
NO OFFENSE.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.533
NO OFFENSE? DID HE
JUST SAY NO OFFENSE?

33:08.567 --> 33:10.233
SHEPHERD.
YEAH.

33:10.267 --> 33:12.300
I NEED O'MALLEY.
WE'RE ABOUT
TO GO INTO SURGERY.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.200
I NEED O'MALLEY.
YOU OKAY, DR. BAILEY?

33:14.233 --> 33:16.467
DON'T CROSS ME.
OH, I WASN'T CROSSING YOU.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.167
(sighs) I'M RISING ABOVE.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.767
I AM RISING ABOVE
AND DO NOT WANT TO BE CROSSED

33:20.800 --> 33:23.200
WHILE I'M BUSY RISING.

33:23.233 --> 33:26.100
I HAVE TO OPERATE
ON A WHITE SUPREMACIST,

33:26.133 --> 33:27.633
AND HE HAS REQUESTED
A WHITE DOCTOR

33:27.667 --> 33:29.833
TO WATCH ME TO MAKE SURE

33:29.867 --> 33:32.467
THAT I DON'T KILL
HIS CRAZY WHITE BEHIND.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.633
NOW I NEED O'MALLEY.
CAN I HAVE HIM OR NOT?
YEAH, O'MALLEY,
GO WITH DR. BAILEY.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.833
YES, SIR.
GET HIM
TO SIGN THE CONSENT,

33:37.867 --> 33:41.000
THEN HAVE HIM ANESTHETIZED
AND READY.

33:42.867 --> 33:45.767
DR. BAILEY,
YOU'RE WELL WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS

33:45.800 --> 33:47.833
TO PASS THIS ON
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

33:47.867 --> 33:50.267
WELL, THAT WOULD MAKE ME
LIKE HIM,

33:50.300 --> 33:52.567
AND I'M NOT LIKE HIM.

33:56.367 --> 33:59.133
OH, SORRY, DR. SHEPHERD,
I'M RUNNING BEHIND TODAY.

33:59.167 --> 34:02.033
I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY
IN JUST A SECOND.

34:02.067 --> 34:04.067
WELL, ACTUALLY, ROSE,
I'M EARLY,

34:04.100 --> 34:05.367
SO TECHNICALLY,
I'M IN YOUR WAY.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.767
OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,
DON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.767
YOU'RE STARING AT MY CHEST.
WHAT?

34:10.800 --> 34:12.800
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE INTENDING
TO ADMIRE MY RING,

34:12.833 --> 34:15.333
BUT IT'S COMING OFF
AS YOU STARING AT MY CHEST.

34:15.367 --> 34:17.267
OH, SORRY.
IT'S JUST THAT, UH,

34:17.300 --> 34:19.500
YOU WEAR YOUR ENGAGEMENT RING
ON YOUR NECKLACE.

34:19.533 --> 34:22.367
WHEN I WAS ENGAGED,
I WORE IT ON MY FINGER.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.167
NOW, YEAH, NECKLACE.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.167
THE STONE WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.300
SORRY.
SORRY, WHY?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.700
ABOUT YOUR ENGAGEMENT.
DID YOU CALL IT OFF RECENTLY?

34:29.733 --> 34:32.200
(laughs) WELL, THAT'S
A PRETTY PERSONAL QUESTION.

34:32.233 --> 34:33.700
YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE FRIENDS NOW.

34:33.733 --> 34:36.300
I MEAN, I SAVED YOU HOURS OF
POTENTIAL LICORICE HUMILIATION,

34:36.333 --> 34:37.700
SO I THINK YOU CAN...
IT ENDED A YEAR AGO,

34:37.733 --> 34:39.500
AND YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE SORRY ABOUT.

34:39.533 --> 34:41.700
IT WAS NEVER GONNA WORK OUT.
HOW COME?

34:41.733 --> 34:44.600
BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS VERY CLEAR
ABOUT WHAT I WANTED,

34:44.633 --> 34:46.300
AND HE WASN'T.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.467
AND THERE'S NO WAY
TO BUILD A FUTURE ON THAT.

RAY, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.500

BUT WE NEED TO GET
AN ULTRASOUND TO BE SURE.

35:22.767 --> 35:24.600
I CAN DO IT.
I CAN GET IN.

LOOK, IF I REMOVE THE PROBE
WITHOUT A GUIDE,

THEY WEREN'T EARLIER.

39:42.867 --> 39:45.700
IS IT CREEPING YOU OUT,
HOW OBSERVANT I AM?

39:45.733 --> 39:47.367
I'M SORRY.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.600
IT'S THE--IT'S THE BOREDOM,
I'M TELLING YOU.

39:49.633 --> 39:51.500
(sighs)

39:51.533 --> 39:52.533
REMEMBER YOUR GIRLFRIEND

39:52.567 --> 39:56.233
WHO JUST TURNED OUT
TO BE A VAPID NARCISSIST?

39:56.267 --> 39:59.133
YOUR BOYFRIEND TURNED OUT
TO JUST BE A JERK.

39:59.167 --> 40:02.033
JERK, ASS,
AND MANY DIRTIER WORDS

40:02.067 --> 40:05.033
THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME
TO USE IN FRONT OF A PATIENT.

40:06.533 --> 40:07.700
I'M SORRY.

40:07.733 --> 40:09.400
YEAH, ME, TOO.

40:09.433 --> 40:12.633
WELL, YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
PLOT YOUR REVENGE?

40:12.667 --> 40:13.667
OKAY.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.367
OKAY.

40:15.400 --> 40:18.067
HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING--
YOU GO OUT WITH ME.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.567
JUST LIKE THAT--

40:19.600 --> 40:21.267
BAM--NEW BOYFRIEND.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.467
AND HE'LL BE ALL,

40:22.500 --> 40:24.833
"WHAT'S HE GOT
THAT I DON'T HAVE?"

40:24.867 --> 40:29.567
AND YOU'LL BE ALL,
"CAROTID ARTERY... EXPOSED.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.700
TOP THAT, LOSER."

40:31.733 --> 40:33.633
AND HE'LL BE ALL,
"I CAN'T.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.567
I CAN'T TOP THAT."
NO.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.500
"I AM A LOSER."
(laughs)

40:37.533 --> 40:40.333
(laughing)

40:40.367 --> 40:41.567
(laughs)

40:41.600 --> 40:43.033
AAH! AAH!

40:43.067 --> 40:45.067
AAH! AAH! (groans)
