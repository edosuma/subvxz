OLIVER: <i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:05.286
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.380 --> 00:08.748
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:08.842 --> 00:10.424
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:13.424
<i>and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son.</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:15.597
<i>So I asked the best man I know
to help.</i>

00:15.682 --> 00:17.218
<i>His name is John Diggle.</i>

00:17.309 --> 00:20.097
<i>And he is the Green Arrow.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:22.223
OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:22.314 --> 00:24.556
Could you tutor me some more
before the test?

00:24.650 --> 00:26.892
- See you soon.
- She's pretty cool.

00:26.985 --> 00:31.320
His life will be better
with you in it. Just like mine.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.611
Cayden James is the most skilled
hacker the world has ever known.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.488
Eight months ago he was scooped up
by A.R.G.U.S.,

00:36.578 --> 00:38.820
and now he's being held
without cause,

00:38.914 --> 00:40.371
being tortured, who knows what else.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.039
Helix is about to
extract Cayden James.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.115
- One...
- Two...

00:43.210 --> 00:44.200
Three.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.082
And Laurel,

00:47.172 --> 00:50.040
<i>she wasn't dead when we found her
back on Lian Yu.</i>

01:20.372 --> 01:21.453
Buy you a drink?

01:22.374 --> 01:24.206
Whiskey. Neat.

01:25.544 --> 01:26.876
Are you waiting for someone?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.295
Is it too cheesy if I say "you"?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.336
I'll let it slide this time.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.421
And what about you?

01:36.263 --> 01:37.925
Let me guess.
You're a numbers guy.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.131
You sit in front of
a computer all day

01:39.224 --> 01:41.261
and you came here
to blow off some steam.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.013
You've got me pegged.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.429
I think the bartender
forgot your order.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.354
I have a better idea.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.357
(BOTH PANTING)

01:57.659 --> 01:59.195
(BOTH MOAN)

02:00.537 --> 02:01.744
Uh-oh.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.656
Looks like I know
your dirty little secret.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.786
Oh, it's...

02:05.876 --> 02:07.287
(SHUSHES)

02:07.794 --> 02:10.252
I won't tell if you won't tell.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.254
All right.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.834
You know my secret. Now...

02:18.096 --> 02:19.758
Tell me one of yours.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.681
Okay.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.511
Only if you promise
not to tell anyone.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.268
Cross my heart and hope to die.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.057
Mmm...

02:42.954 --> 02:45.116
FELICITY: William did an excellent job
picking out your tie.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.200
Yeah. He was very excited.
He wanted to come to dinner.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.289
I told him that Raisa was
his date tonight.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.996
Oh. Well, she's a lucky woman.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.373
Has it, um...

02:56.802 --> 02:59.670
Has it been three years
since the first time we did this?

02:59.888 --> 03:02.722
Yeah, let's just hope that
this date goes better than that one.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.094
I think it will.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.474
(WHISPERS) Don't jinx it.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.803
Masked gunmen could
come through the door,

03:08.897 --> 03:10.604
and it would've been better
than our first dinner.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.857
Well, only because
we were not being blown up.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.527
(STAMMERS) You know,
also because I wasn't ready.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.108
Not the way I am now.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.359
Well, now the time is right.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.318
- PATRON: <i>Mr. Mayor?</i>
- Yes?

03:24.413 --> 03:26.279
I'm sorry to interrupt.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.032
I just wanted to say that I'm voting

03:29.126 --> 03:32.460
against that awful
anti-vigilante referendum.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.878
Oh, that's very nice to hear.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.707
Are you two back together? (GASPS)

03:37.801 --> 03:39.337
Such a sweet couple.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.508
- Well, enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.173
Don't forget to vote, okay?

03:46.977 --> 03:48.434
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

03:48.979 --> 03:49.969
You paid her to say that?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.438
I had absolutely nothing
to do with that.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.765
Hmm.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.022
Well, I am
the mayor's girlfriend now,

03:57.112 --> 04:00.822
so does that get me
a break on my taxes

04:00.907 --> 04:02.990
or maybe a pass on jury duty?

04:03.702 --> 04:06.536
(STAMMERS) I mean, I was gonna offer
to bring you to a fundraiser.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.487
Hmm...

04:08.582 --> 04:10.164
I can not tell you what it is

04:10.250 --> 04:11.661
if you're gonna
keep making that face.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.244
No. Sorry. It's just, you know...

04:15.964 --> 04:20.550
(WHISPERS) With Overwatch and the
start-up with Curtis, and, you know...

04:21.720 --> 04:25.339
It's our old, but new, relationship.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.889
Maybe we could

04:28.727 --> 04:30.969
ease in to some of the things.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.061
Of course, of course.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.523
I love rolling to those things solo.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.562
Yeah, you're lying.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.642
I'm kidding.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.109
I'm really happy that you're busy,

04:42.199 --> 04:45.317
and I'm especially excited
for this thing with Curtis,

04:45.410 --> 04:47.322
because, truth be told,

04:47.412 --> 04:50.576
it is important you have something
in your life that is not just...

04:50.665 --> 04:51.826
- (CELL PHONE VIBRATES)
- The team.

04:51.917 --> 04:52.998
- Yes.
- (CELL PHONE BEEPS)

04:54.252 --> 04:56.790
No, I mean... (WHISPERS) The team.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.459
This is how it felt to be you,
isn't it?

04:59.883 --> 05:00.964
Oh, yeah.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.250
I'm sorry.

05:03.929 --> 05:04.919
Go.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.182
What's going on?

05:14.272 --> 05:17.765
Body dropped outside of a bar.
Dinah's on the scene with SCPD.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.939
DINAH DRAKE:
<i>The vic was dead on arrival.</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:24.400
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

05:24.491 --> 05:26.323
Paramedics are calling it
internal hemorrhaging,

05:26.409 --> 05:28.776
but I'd recognize this kill
from a mile away.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.862
Sonic Scream did this.
An inch from his ear.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.868
- Ouch.
- Laurel.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.371
Witnesses saw the vic leaving
with a woman, a brunette.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.285
Maybe Laurel got a wig?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.415
According to witnesses,

05:38.505 --> 05:40.292
they were very handsy with each other
on the way out.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.045
What do you guys think?
Black Siren turned Black Widow?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.250
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

05:44.594 --> 05:46.301
You know, 'cause she mates
and then kills?

05:46.388 --> 05:47.378
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

05:47.472 --> 05:49.088
Dinah, thanks.
We'll take it from here.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.969
Victim was an accountant
named Jackson Klimavich.

05:54.271 --> 05:58.390
No criminal record, boring job,
really boring Upswipz profile.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.021
Well, he was married,
so maybe not so boring.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.601
Boring and scummy.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.814
Sorry. Had to help Lance finish up
the polling analysis.

06:05.907 --> 06:10.072
Star City stands at 70% against
the anti-vigilante legislation.

06:10.161 --> 06:14.030
That's 70% for us accounting for
the double negative you just used.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.161
Yeah, but after everything
this team has done for the city...

06:16.251 --> 06:17.708
You'd think it'd be higher.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.160
What'd I miss?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.587
Evil Laurel seduced a guy
and then killed him.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.298
- Why?
- That's what we have to figure out.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.546
First, we've got to find her.
Laurel's been in the wind too long.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.172
Yeah, we're on it.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.712
Speaking of being on it,

06:29.806 --> 06:31.513
did you mail out
our articles of incorporation?

06:34.311 --> 06:37.224
For our start-up? The documents
required to, you know, start it up?

06:37.314 --> 06:40.102
Oh, my God. They are in
a manila envelope on my countertop,

06:40.191 --> 06:41.227
- with every intention of mailing them.
- (SIGHS)

06:41.318 --> 06:43.731
I was just telling Oliver
how I'm being stretched too thin.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.152
Wait a minute,
What do you mean by "just"?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.604
We were at dinner
when I got your text.

06:46.698 --> 06:47.984
Felicity...

06:48.074 --> 06:49.360
No, it's the job. It's okay.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.862
No, this is all on me.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.568
I 911'd you over one dead body.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.904
- Can you make it back for dessert?
- Well, no.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.330
- We have to find Evil Laurel.
- No, no, no.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.657
I will find Evil Laurel.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.617
You go out there and take your
ass back and get your man.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.373
- Are you sure?
- Are you kidding me?

07:01.463 --> 07:02.544
I was your guys' biggest shipper.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.668
I feel like the reconciliation
taking effect is kind of on me.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.216
- No. You're amazing.
- I'm "terrific."

07:07.636 --> 07:09.343
- Well...
- Is that getting old?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.419
- I kinda like it.
- You like?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.095
- Yeah. Anyways...
- Cool. All right. Go, go.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.031
Finally. I thought you were gonna
keep me waiting here all night.

07:30.659 --> 07:34.027
Patience is how
wars are won, Ms. Lance.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.070
Well, the first battle's
already over.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.830
Look, I don't know if this is
your first clandestine meeting,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.037
but at this point,
most people would say "thank you."

07:45.173 --> 07:46.163
For the item?

07:46.675 --> 07:48.792
Or for leaving a body
for the police to find?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.797
Better than a witness to question.

08:00.397 --> 08:04.311
Any reservations?
Concerns about what comes next?

08:04.859 --> 08:05.895
Of course not.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.644
This one shouldn't be a problem.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.733
Glad to hear it.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.823
Until we meet again.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.490
(DOOR LOCK BEEPS)

08:21.584 --> 08:23.041
I'm so sorry
that I had to bail on dinner,

08:23.128 --> 08:28.749
but I'm home now, if you want to
come by for some dessert.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.380
Yes. (CHUCKLES) Yes, that was
intentionally suggestive.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.258
Okay, well, good. I'll see you soon.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.434
Nice try, but I wasn't born...

08:45.025 --> 08:46.015
Alena?

08:46.109 --> 08:47.645
Do you always
announce your attacks like that?

08:47.736 --> 08:49.272
What're you doing in my apartment?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.274
You'd think a computer hacker
would know better

08:51.364 --> 08:53.105
than to install a smart-lock
on her door.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.316
I mean, what are you doing here?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.068
I need your help.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.575
You-you? Or Helix-you?

08:59.664 --> 09:00.654
Does it matter?

09:00.749 --> 09:02.206
Let's pretend for a second it does.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.079
(SIGHS)

09:04.836 --> 09:05.952
Who gave you that?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.088
Cayden James.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.337
He's working on something terrible,

09:12.677 --> 09:15.135
something that will
hurt the entire world.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.597
And I need your help to stop him.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.643
I helped you break Cayden James
out of A.R.G.U.S. custody.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.066
I went against my friends.
I went against my team,

09:29.152 --> 09:32.816
because you told me
that Cayden James was a good man.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.569
No, you did it because Cayden could
help you find Adrian Chase.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.648
And he delivered.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.030
So, at what point did he become
a criminal mastermind?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.236
I don't know, at some point during

09:40.330 --> 09:42.447
his eight months
in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.866
They held him in a glorified
shipping container, Felicity.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.123
Nutrition-withholding,
sensory deprivation.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.001
They broke him.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.923
In that case, he should be
in a funny farm somewhere.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.591
He shouldn't be
planning the end of the world.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.886
Actually, how do I know that you
being here isn't part of his plan?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.213
Because I could never go along with

09:59.307 --> 10:00.843
what I suspect
he's planning, Felicity.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.472
I'm a hacktivist, not a monster.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.180
You say he has plans
to hurt the world?

10:10.151 --> 10:11.141
How?

10:11.236 --> 10:12.943
I don't know exactly
what he's planning.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.736
But I saw a casualty estimate,

10:14.823 --> 10:17.691
and the most conservative estimate
is 4% collateral damage.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.366
4% of what?

10:20.745 --> 10:21.781
The world population.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.080
That's almost 300 million people.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.162
If we try and hack his servers,

10:28.253 --> 10:29.664
we might be able to figure out
what he's planning.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.957
- Okay, where is he now?
- Corto Maltese.

10:32.048 --> 10:36.418
But I came here because I didn't know
who else to reach out to.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.465
- Will you help me?

10:43.977 --> 10:46.936
We set Cayden James loose, Alena.
Of course I'm helping.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.566
Looks like the same M.O.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.490
Did Laurel also make out
with this one first?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.118
It's a legitimate
investigatory question.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.366
Cause of death is the same.
This was definitely Laurel.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.788
Yeah, victimology was similar, too,

11:06.875 --> 11:09.492
insofar as this woman is
just as boring as the first guy.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.543

May even be more boring.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.915
Maybe Laurel's killing for sport.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.167
Doesn't sound like her.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.958
Black Siren isn't the Laurel
you remember, remember?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.634
Any word on tracking her down?

we found on either crime scene.

- And Felicity?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.178
I tried texting her,
but she hasn't hit me back.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.555
Fine. Let's hit the streets.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.352
Someone has to be able to
help us find Laurel.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.764
What about me? Uh...

11:31.858 --> 11:34.475
I want to hit streets, too,
and maybe a couple of bad guys.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.652
Curtis, with Felicity AWOL,
we need tech.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.819
Keep working that angle.

working that angle.

- Yeah.
- What about the...

11:49.834 --> 11:51.496
Yeah, but these firewalls
are crafty.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.293

are just...

- I was going to say "impenetrable."

But, yeah, that too.

Cayden would be the only one
who can get into Cayden's system.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.630
You're a genius.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.095
We need to convince Cayden's system
that we're him.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.060
That's like saying,
"All we need is a trillion dollars."

12:10.146 --> 12:11.603
No, we have to work off
Cayden's system.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.102
- I told you. He's in Corto Maltese.
- Yeah, but Helix is right here.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.229
We cleared the place out, Felicity.
It's sanitized.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.026
What about the wiring?
The digital infrastructure?

12:18.112 --> 12:19.193
That's proprietary.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.572
Cayden's own design.
We left that in place.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.194
That'll work. Let's get the gear.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.367
Does that include a ghost drive?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.410
Because we're gonna need that
to get into Cayden's system.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.704
I know a guy.

Um, just some stuff for a start-up that
Curtis and I are trying to start up.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.497
Oh, good for you.

- You guys are funded?
- Well, seed money

the geniuses of Palmer Tech.

if I knew what we were starting up.

No, that's you.

So consider this
an early Christmas gift.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.095
Cayden James is a bad person, and
he's planning on doing a bad thing.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.643
Are you sure that you can trust her?

13:34.022 --> 13:36.014
I wouldn't exactly
use the word "trust."

I'm going, too.

At least tell the team
what you're doing.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.609
I will tell them.
I'll call them on my way.

I don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.718
Laurel's cry resonates
in the terahertz range,

14:48.805 --> 14:50.762
which can be triangulated,
according to geography.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.970

a single word of that,

14:54.060 --> 14:55.346

to find Evil Laurel

we can find her.

that they needed a cover.

where she's operating out of.

about the start-up.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.387
No. This isn't about the company.
This is about Cayden James.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.222
And I don't have time
to talk to you about it right now,

21:15.316 --> 21:17.399
but you were right and I was wrong
about breaking him out of A.R.G.U.S.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.226
- Felicity, listen...
- I'm at Helix right now.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.686
I'm just gonna clear up
this situation real quick.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.988
I will be back to the bunker
before you know it. I promise.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.065
All right. But get back here soon.
We need you.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.149
I'm on it.

21:27.912 --> 21:28.902
Got it!

21:29.288 --> 21:30.904
The "mights" and "maybes"
have paid off.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.083
Backtracing Laurel's soundwaves

21:35.169 --> 21:37.582
produced a probabilistic curve
of geolocations,

21:37.671 --> 21:40.414
which I canvassed
by means of cameras of various sorts.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.256
Curtis, less how, more what.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.924
I've got a probable location
for Laurel's base of operation.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.054
Tasking a keyhole satellite.

21:50.768 --> 21:51.758
When was this?

21:52.353 --> 21:53.343
Ten seconds ago.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.262
Anybody know that guy?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.399
(TYPING)

21:59.485 --> 22:00.475
How about that one?

22:00.569 --> 22:02.151
- Never seen him before.
- I have.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.271
We should go. Felicity's in trouble.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.483
A file in here
is labeled "Arclight."

22:08.577 --> 22:10.534
Must be a code name
for whatever James is planning.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.663
Now the question is,
what is the plan?

22:18.546 --> 22:19.912
(SONIC SCREAM)

22:24.134 --> 22:25.716
You're supposed to be
in Corto Maltese.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.920
- This is Cayden James?
- MAN: <i>No, Ms. Smoak.</i>

22:33.185 --> 22:34.767
I'm Cayden James.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.556
Very nice to finally
make your acquaintance.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.902
In case you're curious
about why I'm here,

22:43.988 --> 22:45.570
it's not nostalgia.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.491
It's you.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.203
We never finished our conversation
in Corto Maltese.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.660
<i>Which is where you thought I was.</i>

22:56.083 --> 22:58.291
Because you've been pinging my cell.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.829
I was hurt. Truly.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.295
Not by the betrayal
so much as the naivetÃ©

23:07.469 --> 23:09.506
of someone I thought had potential.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.797
Sorry, Ms. Smoak.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.100
I'm afraid you're what's known
as collateral damage.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.722
Horrible waste of talent.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.939
Make it as humane as possible.

23:26.906 --> 23:27.896
One shot.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.355
You won't even know.

Call an ambulance.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.966

24:35.349 --> 24:36.840
Stay with me. Alena.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.137
It's bad. It's really bad.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.474
Alena?

24:46.276 --> 24:47.392
How is she?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.189
Stabilized.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.734
The next couple of hours
will tell her story.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.900
I air-gapped her ICU room
just in case if Cayden tried

24:54.994 --> 24:57.236
to kill her by hacking
her hospital equipment. He can't.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.867
- Hey. You all right?
- Am I all right?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.832
That I broke a genius madman
out of prison,

25:02.918 --> 25:05.251
who's apparently working with
the psychopath version of Laurel?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.171
Am I okay that I didn't see
what was right in front of my face

25:08.257 --> 25:09.589
and now Alena might die?

25:09.675 --> 25:10.916
What the hell do you think?

25:13.053 --> 25:14.043
Sorry.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.554
- It's not you I'm mad at.
- I know that.

25:17.808 --> 25:18.924
But right now we need you.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.134
Yeah, I know. Curtis?

25:21.645 --> 25:24.388
All set. Did everything
just like you told me.

25:24.481 --> 25:28.145
I softened the beach so now
you can, you know, do your thing.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.942
Well, I couldn't do that before
because of Cayden.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.855
All right. I'm in.

25:35.743 --> 25:36.733
John was right.

25:36.827 --> 25:39.865
They're hiding their identities
because they are really important.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.038
John thought they were
some kind of spies or something.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.535
More like "something."

25:43.625 --> 25:44.661
<i>All three are access managers</i>

25:44.752 --> 25:47.119
for the IDND, the International
Domain Name Directory.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.086
Let's just pretend for a second

25:49.173 --> 25:50.459
only you and Felicity
know what that is.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.087
The Internet is run on domain names.
You start messing with them

25:53.177 --> 25:55.294
and you start collapsing
whole parts of the Internet.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.594
So Laurel was stealing fingerprints.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.012
To gain access, I guess.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.055
Well, why steal
three sets of fingerprints?

26:00.142 --> 26:01.132
Wouldn't one do the job?

26:01.226 --> 26:02.512
No, the Internet is
divided into sections,

26:02.603 --> 26:04.060
so no one person can take it down
all at once.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.103
Each manager controls a section.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.102
And all three would be needed
to access the master vault,

26:08.192 --> 26:10.058
which oversees all sections.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.144
Right, so Cayden James wants to
take down the Internet?

26:12.237 --> 26:13.227
Can he actually do that?

26:13.322 --> 26:16.065
If you destroy the vault, yes.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.699
And then what? I can't send an email?
I mean, so what?

26:18.786 --> 26:20.402
The Internet controls everything now.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.704
Electricity, water supply,
hospital equipment.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.406
Also planes, trains and automobiles.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.618
Alena said Cayden's casualty estimate
was 300 million people.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.288
- Actually, that sounds low.
- I don't disagree.

26:33.217 --> 26:34.207
This is all my fault.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.587
JOHN: All right,
let's keep our focus here.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.213
So James and his people
wanna hit this vault.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.420
Do we have a location on it?

26:39.556 --> 26:40.797
The location is so classified,

26:40.891 --> 26:43.304
they don't even a word
for how classified it is.

26:43.393 --> 26:44.554
Be that as it may,
I have a hack running.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.635
That'll give us a location soon.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.563
Good. Which means you can get home,
take a shower, clear your head...

26:48.649 --> 26:49.685
I'm fine.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.482
It's not a request, Felicity.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.403
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

27:02.121 --> 27:03.111
BOTH: Hey.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.325
John told me what happened.

27:05.916 --> 27:06.952
Hmm.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.704
So I'm guessing this little visit is
his idea of therapy.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.248
Actually, I'm thinking that
he probably wanted you

27:14.341 --> 27:18.711
to speak to one of the world's
leading experts in guilt and regrets.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.720
FELICITY: Hmm.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.757
(WHISPERS) What's happening now
is not your fault.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.347
Is that what I sounded like
all these years?

27:27.771 --> 27:29.262
You sounded smarter.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.185
How'd you do it?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.982
How did you balance
being the Green Arrow,

27:34.069 --> 27:35.981
the mayor, a boyfriend, a brother?

27:36.071 --> 27:37.061
How did...

27:39.867 --> 27:41.324
How did you do it all by yourself?

27:43.203 --> 27:45.616
(STAMMERS) I didn't do it all by myself.

27:46.957 --> 27:47.947
I had you.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.163
Yeah, well, I know you're just
saying that to get boyfriend points,

27:51.253 --> 27:52.710
and it's working.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.788
I'm being serious, Felicity.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.089
Even if we weren't together,

27:57.968 --> 27:59.175
you were always there with me.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.591
Always there to talk me out of stuff,

28:02.806 --> 28:04.468
to help me being the Green Arrow.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.892
You were literally in my ear

28:08.562 --> 28:10.144
every second that I was in the field.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.064
And that's why I followed you
to the club tonight.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.767
Because I wanted the chance

28:16.486 --> 28:18.978
to be there for you
the way that you've been there for me.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.446
So then what would I say to you

28:25.287 --> 28:26.494
in this situation?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.196
You would

28:29.082 --> 28:32.041
tell me that when I, you,

28:32.836 --> 28:35.123
(CLEARS THROAT) freed Cayden James,

28:35.214 --> 28:36.625
I did it because,

28:37.591 --> 28:39.048
at that moment, at that time,

28:39.134 --> 28:41.000
in your heart,
you thought it was right.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.294
Yeah.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.463
You'd tell me
not to live in the past.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.924
You'd tell me
to make it right in the present.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.973
You'd tell me to trust myself.

Thales of Miletus,

wasn't such a good idea.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.118
- Good thing you're not alone.
- Oliver?

33:25.212 --> 33:27.545
Technically if I'm in this chair

I'm all right with that.
I'm so all right with that.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.212
I'm epically all right with that.

33:32.302 --> 33:33.759
Especially if you have eyes
on this complex.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.552
I think I do.

33:35.639 --> 33:36.755
You've automated this system
to the point

33:36.848 --> 33:38.180
that William could
basically operate it.

33:38.266 --> 33:41.225
Do you see the room
in the far northwest quadrant?

33:41.311 --> 33:43.849
I do. But I also see 10 hostiles
between you and it.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.396
So let me put on the safest path.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.698
Sorry, right.
My left. Your right.

something about yourself.

Oh, thank you for that.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.192
Just wanted to give you
a little time.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.652
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need it.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.453
I have to break through
the processor's protective firewall

35:24.539 --> 35:26.121
to stop Cayden's virus.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.824
Add the fact that the processor
is exponentially overclocking,

35:28.918 --> 35:30.409
and he's disabled the cooling system.

35:30.754 --> 35:33.838
Did not understand a single word
that you just said.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.340
Well, you understand blaring noises

35:36.426 --> 35:37.962
- and really scary lights, right?
- (ALARM SOUNDING)

35:38.136 --> 35:39.297

Told you.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.844
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)

36:24.349 --> 36:27.433
Yeah. You know, if this whole
role-reversal thing sticks around,

36:27.519 --> 36:28.976
you're really gonna
have to adopt my saying,

36:29.062 --> 36:30.644
"I'm not saying I told you so."

36:31.272 --> 36:32.513
You tell me you told me so.

Yeah. But not all the time.

36:36.736 --> 36:37.817
Thank you.

I'm just glad I found a way to help.

- I certainly hope not.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.298
I think Mayor Queen's
probably too busy

36:59.384 --> 37:00.875
to be moonlighting as tech support.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.594
Besides, after all those years
in the field,

37:03.680 --> 37:05.797
it'd be a shame if you went down
for carpal tunnel.

37:07.517 --> 37:09.509
All kidding aside, (CLEARS THROAT)

Those operatives,

37:14.399 --> 37:16.231
they were the same ones
that we took out last month.

Sorry. Old habits.

- That, and fixing our mistakes.

None of this is on you, Felicity.

I vouched for Cayden.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.711
You were just backing my play.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.387
Yeah, well, like you said,
he changed.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.140
Yeah. (SIGHS)

for an evil Ã¼ber-hacker...

37:54.564 --> 37:56.305
- I'm just assuming.
- Hmm...

37:56.733 --> 37:58.315
Do you know what you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

37:58.401 --> 37:59.391
(SIGHS)

38:00.904 --> 38:02.190
I'm gonna take some time.

38:03.281 --> 38:07.616
And gain some
much-needed perspective.

38:07.786 --> 38:11.120
And then, maybe, if you'll have me,

38:12.248 --> 38:13.455
come work for you at your start-up?

38:13.792 --> 38:14.873
Yeah, that'd be great.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.495
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you should.

38:16.669 --> 38:17.750
I mean, maybe in a year or two,

38:17.837 --> 38:19.874
Curtis and I'll actually have an idea
of what to develop.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.081
Oh, actually, I have a pitch for you
on that.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.708
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.460
Why did you get fired
from Palmer Tech?

38:26.554 --> 38:29.092
Well, besides me being lousy
at balancing my time

38:30.099 --> 38:31.556
and working with the team?

38:31.643 --> 38:33.680
The board actually violently
resisted my...

Efforts to replicate
your spinal implant.

38:36.689 --> 38:37.725
Yeah.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.901
something that would
change the world,

38:42.987 --> 38:46.856
and you've literally been sitting
on the right idea this whole time.

38:46.950 --> 38:47.940
I couldn't figure out a way

38:48.034 --> 38:50.026
to affordably mass-produce
the implant at Palmer Tech...

But now you have Curtis
and no board oversight.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.030
(CHUCKLES)

38:55.124 --> 38:57.207
You know, Curtis and I
have actually had a really hard time

38:57.293 --> 38:58.579
coming up with
a name for the company,

38:58.670 --> 39:00.878
almost as hard a time
as we have for a concept...

39:00.964 --> 39:02.956
So, I was wondering
how you would feel about me

39:03.049 --> 39:05.666
appropriating the name Helix?

39:06.719 --> 39:10.087
Well, I think you don't generally
need to worry about criminal hackers

39:10.181 --> 39:12.013
coming after you
for trademark infringement.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.886
- That's true.
<i>- And I think</i>

39:14.143 --> 39:15.509
it would be really nice

39:16.145 --> 39:18.102
to see something good
come of the name.

39:18.481 --> 39:21.349
- "Helix Dynamics."
- That rolls off the tongue nicely.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.104
Cool logo possibilities,

39:23.194 --> 39:24.651
easily engravable on a Nobel medal...

39:24.737 --> 39:26.649
Funny, those are
Curtis's criteria, too.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.772
- (CHUCKLES)
- I think it's possible.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.200
A reward for a job only half done?

39:36.291 --> 39:37.907
A means of preventing them
from tracking you

39:38.001 --> 39:39.287
by way of your sonic scream.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.369
And the job was done to perfection.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.205
I thought the objective
was to take down the Internet.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.258
Oh, no, the objective was to take down
the firewall protecting the vault.

39:48.761 --> 39:52.721
And Ms. Smoak
was most adept in complying.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.092
Why couldn't you
find a way to do it yourself?

39:56.185 --> 39:59.428
I've been doing this too long
to leave trails, Ms. Lance.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.184
Much safer to have Ms. Smoak's

40:01.274 --> 40:03.891
digital fingerprints
on the processor, not mine.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.018
And once she helped taken down
the firewall,

40:06.112 --> 40:07.648
I was able to upload

40:08.031 --> 40:11.945
a critical piece of code to Arclight.

40:12.619 --> 40:13.951
What happens now?

40:14.454 --> 40:15.945
We take the next step.

the whole thing. No interruptions,

40:36.142 --> 40:37.724
no armed assassins...

40:41.272 --> 40:44.606
