09:45.818 --> 09:48.788
{\an8}All right. It's
a proper introduction.

09:48.854 --> 09:52.491
{\an8}Right. That's exactly
how I wanted to do it
the first time I met you.

09:52.558 --> 09:56.429
Well, you didn't start
off on that foot, girl.

09:59.598 --> 10:03.002
I was wrong. I will admit
to you right now,

10:03.069 --> 10:05.171
as a woman to woman,
I'm sorry,

10:05.237 --> 10:10.142
but I felt that you looked at me
like, why is this bitch here?

10:10.209 --> 10:12.311
{\an5}I am a transgender artist.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.311
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.114
And I've been through
a hell of a lot in my life,

10:15.181 --> 10:17.483
like with people not
wanting me around them

10:17.550 --> 10:20.419
because they know who I am,
and I honestly thought

10:20.486 --> 10:21.687
that's how you were
doing me.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.757
{\an8}Honestly, when you first
came into the situation,

10:24.824 --> 10:27.593
{\an5}I didn't know you,
so I was doing something
like, "Who's this?"

10:27.660 --> 10:30.596
{\an1}So maybe my delivery came off
really, really strong

10:30.663 --> 10:33.699
{\an1}and I apologize if I made you
feel any type of way,

10:33.766 --> 10:37.136
{\an4}but we not gonna get
nowhere going...

10:33.766 --> 10:37.136
Right.

10:37.203 --> 10:41.307
{\an4}You have to really take
the high road to have
some type of growth,

10:41.374 --> 10:43.709
{\an1}and that's why I'm even
willing to, you know,

10:43.776 --> 10:45.578
allow that to be
whatever it was

10:45.644 --> 10:47.313
and to move forward
from that situation.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.248
{\an5}'Cause we could be
the best of friends.
We could...

10:49.315 --> 10:50.816
Did y'all just become
best friends?

10:50.883 --> 10:53.619
{\an5}I don't know.

10:50.883 --> 10:53.619
I think y'all just
became best friends.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.554
{\an1}Not friends.
Cool it with the "friends."

10:55.621 --> 10:58.657
I wouldn't say
me and Sidney are besties,

10:58.724 --> 11:00.860
but, I mean, people
have judged me too,

11:00.926 --> 11:03.362
so to hear what Sidney Starr
has been going through

11:03.429 --> 11:05.798

I definitely get it.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.501

11:08.567 --> 11:09.935

{\an7}I've heard so much

13:27.006 --> 13:29.475
{\an5}Now, I've been seeing
Mariah have some slip-ups
on social media,

13:29.542 --> 13:32.211
but I know for a fact
that she's making an effort

13:32.278 --> 13:34.513
to focus on her career
and her family.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.649
Seeing how much she's grown

13:36.715 --> 13:38.918
is really inspiring to me.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.586
{\an8}I feel like I too have changed

Oh, my God.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.402
{\an1}Mariah, I feel like
you're going through hell.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.871
It's so hard.
Like, at this point,

13:58.938 --> 14:01.407
I'm gonna pursue
full custody

14:01.473 --> 14:05.544
{\an1}and if it means to take
my mother's parental rights,

14:05.611 --> 14:08.681
like, that's what
it's gonna have to be.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.750
I had to literally
change my whole life

14:11.817 --> 14:16.455
{\an5}to accommodate you not
being able to be a mother
for the third time.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.657
You're like a single mom
of a whole entire family.

14:18.724 --> 14:22.361
I've sacrificed
so much, Jonathan,

14:22.428 --> 14:26.632
{\an5}that that's why,
when people attack me
on Instagram and stuff,

14:26.699 --> 14:29.401
{\an5}I get like that
and I get emotional
when I talk about it,

14:29.468 --> 14:31.370
'cause I'm like, "Yo,
you don't understand

14:31.437 --> 14:33.239
what I deal with
every day."

14:33.305 --> 14:35.975
I don't want to leave her.
No, it's okay.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.477

It's okay.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.477
Are you okay?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.613
I'm okay.

Go ahead, go play.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.017
Even that,
you see what I mean?

14:45.084 --> 14:46.418
Like, I can't even
cry in front of her

14:46.485 --> 14:47.886
and there's times
where I want to cry

14:47.953 --> 14:50.389
and I'm like...

14:56.128 --> 14:59.431

my three-year-old nephew,

14:59.498 --> 15:03.702
and I honestly get super
overwhelmed at times

15:03.769 --> 15:07.172
and that's why I'm happy to have
people like Jonathan in my life

15:07.239 --> 15:11.043
to be my shoulder to lean on
when I feel like falling.

15:11.110 --> 15:15.381
{\an5}What I've learned
for sure is, when
you are on drugs,

15:15.447 --> 15:19.084
{\an4}you tend to take on
this mentality of, the
world is against you.

15:15.447 --> 15:19.084
{\an3}Yeah.

15:19.151 --> 15:20.919
I've been in that place,
you know what I'm saying?

15:20.986 --> 15:23.222
{\an1}I was lashing out
and attacking people

15:23.289 --> 15:25.924
{\an1}and always kind of somehow
feeling like the victim.

15:25.991 --> 15:29.261

I gotta be honest,
a little disturbing.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.853

15:54.920 --> 15:56.655

One thing I definitely
owe you is an apology.

32:06.124 --> 32:09.794
I held you 100% accountable

for something that wasn't
even really my business.

that I knew

32:21.673 --> 32:24.008
Anais was equally

32:34.085 --> 32:35.687
She was your friend.

32:35.753 --> 32:37.889

in that moment.

grownups here.

32:39.724 --> 32:42.226

I feel like she's
in a dark place,

32:45.263 --> 32:48.066
{\an1}and she needs me now
more than ever.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.001
I saw a picture
of her online,

32:50.068 --> 32:53.271
{\an1}and I'm just like,
"That's not my friend."

32:53.338 --> 32:56.507
That's not Anais.

32:56.574 --> 32:58.776

33:06.718 --> 33:09.387
I have been reaching out
to this girl for weeks.

33:09.454 --> 33:12.957
{\an1}She is not responding.
Ruben is not responding.

33:13.024 --> 33:14.659
{\an5}Well, you know why?

33:13.024 --> 33:14.659
{\an1}I'm reaching out
to relatives.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.028
{\an1}No, no,
she's not responding.

33:17.095 --> 33:20.565
{\an5}She's been in and out
of mental facilities
for about the last month.

33:20.631 --> 33:22.734
So, where is she right now?

33:22.800 --> 33:24.736
Is she talking to you?

33:24.802 --> 33:27.405
{\an5}(Rich)
Anais and I have reconnected
since the dustup last year

33:27.472 --> 33:29.006
with her and Ruben
and everything.

33:29.073 --> 33:31.209
A lot of things
have changed since then.

33:31.275 --> 33:33.344
Anais has been in and out
of a mental facility

33:33.411 --> 33:34.946
for the last few months.

33:35.012 --> 33:37.548
Not to mention things at home
with her and Ruben

33:37.615 --> 33:39.083
have not been going well.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.352
All that has led
Anais to be committed

33:41.419 --> 33:43.621
by Ruben multiple times.

33:43.688 --> 33:47.525
{\an5}I get a call
from some hospital,
some mental facility.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.360
{\an3}It's her.

33:49.427 --> 33:52.563
{\an5}I spoke to the nurse,
and I'm like, "Yo,
what's going on with her?"

33:52.630 --> 33:55.066
{\an5}That's when she explained
to me it's usually
a three-day hold,

33:55.133 --> 33:56.701
but she's not taking
her medication.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.003
{\an5}The doctor won't
release her because
now she's arguing.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.738
She's talking about
conspiracy theories.

34:00.805 --> 34:03.875
{\an5}The CIA were trying
to medicate her
and keep her down.

34:03.941 --> 34:05.843
She's like, "I'm a bird.
I just need to be free."

34:05.910 --> 34:10.081
{\an4}I know the whole spiel
because I've been
hearing it for 20 years.

34:10.148 --> 34:14.252
I've always figured
that Anais has some sort of

34:14.318 --> 34:17.722
mental issue
with her conspiracy theories

34:17.789 --> 34:20.056
{\an5}that she's always
rambling on about
and things like that.

34:20.123 --> 34:21.759
I've seen her stressed out.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.228
I've seen her go
through hell in her marriage.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.130
At this point, I just wanna
be there for her,

34:26.197 --> 34:28.800
because more than anything,
I'm always going

34:28.866 --> 34:30.802
to love Anais
no matter what.

34:30.868 --> 34:33.371
{\an1}I hate that she's going
through this (bleep) alone,

34:33.438 --> 34:36.574
{\an1}because I know
how lonely she gets.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.775
{\an5}Are we being honest
and candid in this
conversation?

34:38.842 --> 34:41.913
{\an1}Yes.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.817
y'all relationship
is toxic, J.

34:45.882 --> 34:47.385
And we talked,
and I asked her.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.420
{\an5}I said, "Why won't you get
released to Jonathan?"

34:47.452 --> 34:49.420
{\an1}Right.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.322
"(bleep) Jonathan!
He did this!"

34:52.389 --> 34:53.724
And then she
brought up you OD'd,

34:53.791 --> 34:55.693
went crazy and called
her bitches and hoes

34:55.760 --> 34:57.061
in front of people.

34:57.128 --> 34:59.397
And-- and you threw
things in her face.

34:59.464 --> 35:00.798
{\an1}But she has to
forgive me,

35:00.865 --> 35:02.934
{\an1}and I understand I really
hurt her feelings.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.503
I told her really
mean, mean things.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.371
{\an1}But I'm not
like that anymore.

35:09.607 --> 35:10.908
She needs to get right.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.177
And honestly, Jonathan...

35:13.244 --> 35:15.580
{\an5}If you're her friend
the way you say
you're her friend,

35:15.646 --> 35:18.216
you'll take a step back

35:18.282 --> 35:21.285
and let her get right.

you singing a song
like this is a joke.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.401
{\an1}And why you keep
walking away with my kid?

36:10.468 --> 36:12.470
'Cause I'm trying to rush
to the door, that's why!

36:12.537 --> 36:14.105
With you following me.

36:14.171 --> 36:16.274
{\an4}And that's the problem,
that you keep rushing
to the door.

36:16.340 --> 36:20.011
{\an5}Oh, you serious.

36:16.340 --> 36:20.011
I'm very serious.

36:20.077 --> 36:23.014
{\an1}Let me put him down,
'cause we're gonna talk.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.484
{\an5}I don't really have
very much time
for this serious talk.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.619
{\an1}I know, and that's
the problem.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.054
Why does Cyn
always wanna talk

36:30.121 --> 36:32.189
when I'm about to do
something important for work?

36:32.256 --> 36:34.225
Mommy and Daddy
gotta talk.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.427
But I know if I don't
give her a minute of my time

36:36.494 --> 36:39.397
right this second, I'll never
hear the end end of it.

36:39.463 --> 36:42.333
{\an5}I wanna have
a serious conversation
with you, Joey,

36:42.400 --> 36:46.070
because, to be quite
honest with you,

36:46.137 --> 36:49.941
{\an5}I'm not too happy
right now where we are
with our relationship.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.510
I don't feel like
you're there.

36:52.577 --> 36:56.147
{\an5}You are neglecting me,
and you are neglecting
your relationship,

36:56.213 --> 36:57.782
and you're
neglecting your family.

36:57.848 --> 37:03.788
{\an1}Unfortunately,
my work is 25/8...

37:03.854 --> 37:06.357
{\an1}until I work myself
into a position

37:06.424 --> 37:08.693
where that's
not the case.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.928
Good for you!
Keep working!

37:10.995 --> 37:12.263
{\an5}I'm not-- I 'm not looking--

37:10.995 --> 37:12.263
Keep working!

37:12.330 --> 37:13.598
Go get that (bleep) money.
I'm proud of you.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.267
{\an1}I'm not looking
to decrease work.

37:16.334 --> 37:17.768
So what-- I don't need
you to decrease work!

37:17.835 --> 37:19.904
{\an1}Then what the (bleep)
are you saying?

37:19.971 --> 37:21.672
I need us to find
a middle ground, Joey.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.007
I need us to act like
we're in a relationship.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.842
{\an1}The middle ground
was the nanny.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.577
No, I don't need no nanny.

37:26.644 --> 37:28.379
I need us to
reconnect, Joey.

37:28.446 --> 37:31.248
{\an5}We're not here,
we're not here,
we're not here.

37:31.315 --> 37:34.318
{\an4}You think that
the sole reason
for our disconnect

37:34.385 --> 37:37.588
{\an1}is because
I'm working a lot

37:37.655 --> 37:39.657
and I'm neglectful at home.
That's what you're saying?

37:39.724 --> 37:41.392
{\an6}Yeah.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.392
{\an1}Would you like to know
what I really think?

37:41.459 --> 37:43.461
I would love to know
what you think.

37:43.527 --> 37:45.896
{\an1}For the past year
and a half,

37:45.963 --> 37:48.733
{\an1}how you have maneuvered
in this relationship,

37:48.799 --> 37:52.203
{\an4}is very, very different
than the person
I fell in love with.

37:52.269 --> 37:55.006
{\an1}And I'm trying to guess
what's going on with you.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.807
{\an1}I don't know
if it's depression.

37:56.874 --> 37:58.909
{\an1}I don't know if it's
postpartum depression.

37:58.976 --> 38:01.379
I don't know if it's
some career (bleep),

38:01.445 --> 38:02.813
{\an1}but you don't talk to me
about a (bleep) thing

38:02.880 --> 38:04.115
{\an1}if you wanna
talk about it.

38:04.181 --> 38:05.916
'Cause you're always
so busy, Joe.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.451
{\an4}I know.
You keep a reason.
You keep a reason.

38:07.518 --> 38:09.687
{\an5}And every time I try
to talk to you,
you're dismissive.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.288
You're dismissive
as (bleep).

38:11.355 --> 38:12.957
I want someone who's
gonna listen to me

38:13.024 --> 38:14.692
and make me feel
like I'm important.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.093
You don't make me
feel like that.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.695
{\an1}No, I'm not gonna
make you feel like that

38:17.762 --> 38:18.896
when everything
you bring to me

38:18.963 --> 38:20.564
{\an1}is about some
real tiny bull(bleep)

38:20.631 --> 38:22.133
{\an1}while I'm in the middle
of working.

38:22.199 --> 38:24.068
And that's
my problem with you!

38:24.135 --> 38:26.270
That you don't--
You can't even see (bleep)

38:26.337 --> 38:27.805
'cause all you're into
is (bleep) work!

38:27.872 --> 38:29.573
That's my issue
with you right there.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.975
That's my problem.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.576
'Cause I've been depressed
for a few months now.

38:32.643 --> 38:36.147
{\an5}You can't even see that,
'cause all you do
is (bleep) work.

38:36.213 --> 38:39.150
(exhales)

38:39.216 --> 38:41.852
Mmm! Ahh!

38:41.919 --> 38:43.888
{\an1}Are you worried about me
seeing the depression?

38:43.954 --> 38:46.924
{\an4}Or are you worried about
actually doing something
about the depression?

38:46.991 --> 38:48.559
I could do something
about the depression--

38:48.626 --> 38:50.594
You never come
to me and say,

38:50.661 --> 38:52.396
{\an1}"Hey...

38:52.463 --> 38:54.365
{\an1}"I'm feeling
a way mentally.

38:54.432 --> 38:57.201
{\an1}My mental health is off."
I've never heard that.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.336
{\an5}My mental health is off.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.336
{\an1}Thank you!

38:59.403 --> 39:02.106
{\an5}I don't but
the insensitive,
cut and dried

39:02.173 --> 39:03.674
Joe Budden right now.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.077
I need the man that
I fell in love with,

39:06.143 --> 39:09.780
the man who gives a damn
about my feelings.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.249
Regardless, whether I'm
depressed or not, Joey,

39:12.316 --> 39:14.185
you are still
being neglectful.

39:14.251 --> 39:16.520
You are.
I'm still not happy

39:16.587 --> 39:19.023
{\an1}with you and with how
we are in our relationship.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.693
{\an1}"Us" is secondary to you
and depression.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.729
{\an1}I'm fine if me and you
break up

39:24.795 --> 39:26.564
if you're not depressed.

39:29.633 --> 39:33.504
I have to go.

39:33.571 --> 39:36.540
{\an3}Then go.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.542
You can go.
I don't care.

39:48.853 --> 39:50.788
(crying softly)

39:59.830 --> 40:01.232
{\an8}(Jonathan)
Next time on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop"...

40:01.298 --> 40:03.734
{\an8}This sex toy company,
they hollered at me.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.102
{\an8}They wanna do a photo shoot.

40:05.169 --> 40:08.372
{\an8}They wanna pour clay
all over me and do a mold.

40:08.439 --> 40:11.442
{\an8}So to do this molding, do I
have to be, like, rock (bleep)?

40:11.509 --> 40:13.377
{\an7}Semi-(bleep) would be
good enough, man.

40:13.444 --> 40:14.845
{\an8}Wow.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.647
{\an7}I need help.
I need you to talk to Cyn.

40:16.714 --> 40:19.483
{\an8}Me talk to Cyn?

40:16.714 --> 40:19.483
{\an7}Yes.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.552
{\an7}I'm, like,
screaming for help.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.754
{\an8}I'm pretty sure that you
haven't been the Cyn

40:23.821 --> 40:25.956
{\an8}that he fell in love
with, neither.

40:26.023 --> 40:28.893
{\an8}♪♪

40:28.959 --> 40:31.829
{\an8}We are gonna do
a whole makeover, bitch.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.531
{\an7}Well, I don't feel
like I need a makeover.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.432
{\an8}You're looking
trashy right now.

40:35.499 --> 40:37.168
{\an8}Ain't nobody wanna
wear this (bleep)!

40:37.234 --> 40:39.403
{\an8}One of the girls
in my mentorship program,

40:39.470 --> 40:41.238
{\an8}she's in
the foster care system.

40:41.305 --> 40:42.940
{\an8}She's having
some issues there.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.975
{\an8}I brought her to my house.

40:45.042 --> 40:47.645
{\an8}I cannot send this baby girl
somewhere unsafe.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.380
{\an8}If she's here with you

40:49.446 --> 40:51.448
{\an8}and the state is supposed
to be her guardian,

40:51.515 --> 40:53.784
{\an8}then in essence you're
harboring a minor

40:53.851 --> 40:56.587
{\an8}that you're not supposed to,
and this is against the law.
