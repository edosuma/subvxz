WEBVTT

00:13.471 --> 00:14.305
I think

00:14.931 --> 00:16.599
I know who this bitch is.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.685
What'd you say?

00:21.104 --> 00:23.690
You said this bitch's name
is Mo-mi Kim, didn't you?

02:02.956 --> 02:07.752
MASK GIRL

02:08.920 --> 02:13.091
CHUN-AE KIM

02:18.429 --> 02:20.473
Why don't you introduce yourself?

02:23.184 --> 02:24.686
I'm Chun-ae Kim.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.479
Hmm? What?

02:27.772 --> 02:28.857
Wh-- What "ae Kim"?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.484
Chun-ae Kim, sir.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.573
Hey, hey! Quiet-- Quiet down. And?

02:37.740 --> 02:38.616
That's it?

02:40.577 --> 02:41.452
Yes.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.498
Sit in the empty seat there.
The second one from the back.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.836
And by the way,
some of you were late again today.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.088
Don't be late,
wear your uniforms properly,

02:52.172 --> 02:54.507
and focus,
the tests are right around the corner.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.718
And Min-jun, stop falling asleep in class.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.136
Yes, sir.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.345
Keep it down!

03:00.138 --> 03:02.390
-Have a good day.
-You too!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.899
Did you watch
Music Plaza yesterday?

03:10.982 --> 03:13.610
Did you watch it yesterday?
My oppa got an award for it.

03:13.693 --> 03:17.155
Oh my God, he was so cute.
I was dying, I swear!

03:19.490 --> 03:21.701
Hey! Sechs Kies or H.O.T.?

03:22.202 --> 03:23.203
Huh? What?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.122
Do you like Sechs Kies or H.O.T.?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.332
I like…

03:31.211 --> 03:32.587
Sechs Kies.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.548
-Sechs Kies?
-What the heck? Ugh! Damn.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.425
Damn. You're lame.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.677
So lame.
Let's go to the snack bar.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.228
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.314
-Why's he always so good-looking?
-Yeah.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.483
Get lost!

04:01.324 --> 04:04.911
-Haven't seen you in a while.
-I know, it's been too long.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.579
His name was Bu-yong.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.291
He was preparing to make his debut
as a member of a boy band.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.960
He was my first love.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.631
But at the time,
all I could do was watch him from afar.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.217
I couldn't say a word to him.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.640
The next time we saw each other
was the summer of junior year.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.397
Have a good one.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.403
Welcome.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.536
Hold on.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.705
You know me, don't you?

04:48.788 --> 04:49.622
Huh?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.541
We were in the same class last year.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.168
Um, we were.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.753
Wasn't your name Chun-ae?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.299
You… Yeah, that's my name. How d'you know?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.010
You have the same name as my grandma.

05:03.344 --> 05:06.055
-Oh.
-Yeah, but it's such a relief, honestly.

05:07.056 --> 05:07.932
What is?

05:08.516 --> 05:10.435
That I have someone I know work here.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.442
Sorry… you-- you're not-- you can't…

05:17.525 --> 05:18.901
buy alcohol.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.405
Can you make an exception?

05:36.586 --> 05:37.837
I'm sorry, but

05:38.588 --> 05:41.132
can I have a pack of Seven as well?

05:41.716 --> 05:43.092
Oh, Seven.

05:48.973 --> 05:52.060
Wait. You can't go and tell
anybody else, ok--

05:52.143 --> 05:53.811
Yeah, of course.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.860
Thank you so much, Chun-ae.

06:01.986 --> 06:02.862
Bye now.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.949
After that day,

06:07.533 --> 06:08.910
he came by here more often.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.540
I was happy that I got to talk to him,
regardless of the circumstances.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.596
Hey!

06:29.764 --> 06:31.557
Bu-yong sent me to get you.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.312
Me?

06:37.063 --> 06:37.939
Where to?

06:38.564 --> 06:39.399
Get on.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.943
Where are we going?

06:42.026 --> 06:43.820
It's Bu-yong's birthday,

06:44.445 --> 06:46.197
and he really wanted to invite you.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.968
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

07:07.051 --> 07:09.095
-Damn it!
-I don't want to.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.264
-Chun-ae! What's up?
-Man, I'm drunk.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.142
-Hey, what's up?
-Come over here.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.895
Hey, you. Move for her.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.482
Come sit here.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.529
What is she, a lumberjack?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.114
Thanks for coming, Chun-ae.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.451
Well… thank you for inviting me.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.413
Have you ever drank?

07:35.496 --> 07:38.833
-No. I've never really tried it.
-Oh, really?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.127
My birthday will be your first time, then.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.464
-Ohhh!
-Aah!

07:44.547 --> 07:46.132
This is an honor, man!

07:46.215 --> 07:48.718
-Oooooh!
-Hey! C'mon, drink!

07:48.801 --> 07:52.054
Drink up!
Drink up! Drink up!

07:52.138 --> 07:55.683
-Chug! Chug! Chug! C'mon!
-C'mon, drink up already.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.227
-Chug! Chug!
-Drink it. Let's go!

07:58.311 --> 08:00.730
-That's right!
-She's gulping it down!

08:00.813 --> 08:03.149
-She's drinking it!
-Don't drink it all at once.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.942
-Jesus Christ.
-You'll get drunk.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.406
I called Yong-su's friend
to come by later.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.408
-Yong-su's friend?
-Jesus!

08:12.492 --> 08:16.037
-Oh. I'm sorry about that.
-It was just my shoulder.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.206
You did? Yong-su's friend
is so good-looking!

08:18.289 --> 08:20.208
It's crazy how much you like men.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.711
-Maybe I shouldn't have called him.
-Oh, c'mon! What did I do?

08:51.447 --> 08:53.032
Why aren't you inside?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.077
You okay?

08:56.160 --> 08:56.994
What?

08:58.246 --> 08:59.413
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.666
Ah. See I told you to drink slowly.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.710
Well, I'm okay. Don't worry.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.046
-Good to hear.
-Yeah.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.382
Um, Chun-ae.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.010
Yeah?

09:16.389 --> 09:17.682
I have something to say.

09:20.142 --> 09:23.688

09:23.771 --> 09:29.443

09:35.616 --> 09:38.536
The check came out
to be more than I expected.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.372
I… How-- How much?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.624
Like, 200,000 won.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.959
That--

09:45.543 --> 09:46.669
That's a lot of money.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.216
I will be getting some money next week.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.176
I'll pay you back right away.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.891
I'll lend it to you.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.271
Thank you so much.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.774
I knew
I could trust you, seriously.

10:14.238 --> 10:17.617
Bu-yong did not pay me back,
even after a week had passed.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.243
In fact,

10:19.327 --> 10:22.204
he always came to see me
whenever he needed money.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.004
Two bottles of soju, please.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.881

BU-YONG, HUGE CONGRATS ON YOUR DEBUT
YOU WERE TOTALLY AWESOME

11:08.668 --> 11:11.295
-Hey! What are you doing?
-More than a month had passed…

11:11.379 --> 11:13.547
-It's getting busy!
-…but he never replied.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.652
Bu-yong!

11:34.735 --> 11:36.404
Don't push. Don't push!

11:39.031 --> 11:39.949
Bu-yong!

12:28.080 --> 12:30.624
Uh! It's so damn cold.
Seriously, fuck.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.752
-Did you get the cigarettes?
-Yeah.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.712
-But I don't have a lighter.
-I do.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.631
Yeah, you got a lot
of folded paper cranes again.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.759
Pile of trash
keeps growing bigger, damn it.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.135
Fucking hell, seriously.

12:41.969 --> 12:42.887
Light me up?

12:45.514 --> 12:46.348
Thanks.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.144
By the way, did you know her?

12:51.312 --> 12:52.146
Who?

12:52.229 --> 12:54.523
The girl who knew your name.
She was standing there.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.487
Uh… We were
in the same class in high school.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.030
Ah, same class.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.074
It's not like
you hung out with her, right?

13:04.158 --> 13:06.869
You fuckin' asshole.
Do you wanna die? Are you crazy?

13:06.952 --> 13:10.122
-C'mon, it was a joke.
-She was one of my bank accounts.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.665
-"Bank account"?
-Yeah.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.502
I used to constantly
borrow money from her.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.254
What the hell?
How many "bank accounts" do you have?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.924
When I was at my peak, um,

13:20.716 --> 13:22.134
had about ten or so.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.719
You had ten?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.096
You're fuckin' amazing!

13:26.597 --> 13:27.431
Okay, so…

13:28.432 --> 13:30.434
how much did you exactly get out of her?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.895
Like, enough to buy
a luxury car.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.271
Wha-- That's crazy.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.816
She used to be
my reliable source of income.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.859
Did you do anything for her?

13:38.943 --> 13:42.029
Girls like that, you call them
saying you're having a hard time…

PHILIP LEAVES GROUP

14:27.408 --> 14:29.493
I wanted to become pretty.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.289
That was the only goal I had in my life.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.836
Hello, everyone!

14:38.919 --> 14:41.005
Today, here at Gangcheon Plus Mart,

14:41.088 --> 14:44.633
we are having
a three-year anniversary sale.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.720
We will be holding
a big event during the sale period.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.109
I thought
I would avoid him if I ever met him,

15:02.192 --> 15:04.486
but strangely enough, I became curious.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.155
Hey. Bu-yong Choi.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.948
Don't miss out on this great deal!

15:08.032 --> 15:09.158
Who are you?

15:10.993 --> 15:11.827
It's me.

15:12.786 --> 15:13.621
Chun-ae.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.122
Huh?

15:15.205 --> 15:17.708
From Seonghui High School.
You know, Chun-ae Kim.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.426
I could feel the drastic change
in the way he looked at me.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.345
That excited me.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.112
Argh. Oof. Argh.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.115
You scared me, nasty dog. Go.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.124
Get up now. C'mon, I'm hungry.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.210
Five minutes.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.296
Just five.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.595
All he had to his name

16:12.596 --> 16:13.847
was a beat-up car.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.436
Bu-yong was afraid to work.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.147
Maybe due to the fact
that he was a former boy band member.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.775
It made me feel rather guilty.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.657
Have this too.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.034
All right.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.623
You can stay at my place if you want.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.458
Until you get a job.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.422
I mean, sure.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.507
But will you be okay?

16:49.091 --> 16:51.218
As long as
you try your best to find a job.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.555
Yeah, I will. Yeah.

16:55.222 --> 16:58.684
So I had to…
find a job that made more money, for him.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.602
Do you sing well?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.688
Oh, a little bit.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.857
How about dancing?

17:04.940 --> 17:07.609
-I performed at promotional events.
-Oh, very nice.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.904
Physical contact won't be acceptable here.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.199
But depending on the individual,
there may be some touching.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.160
So try your best to avoid them, okay?

17:16.243 --> 17:19.872
We don't have rude customers
that engage in excessive physical contact,

17:20.372 --> 17:23.792
but there are idiots who become,
um, dickheads if they drink a lot.

Ah, Ping-ping!
What did you do today?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.220
Did you have a good time?

18:19.306 --> 18:21.809
I told you
to throw out the trash this morning.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.189
Why are you sitting in the dark anyway?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.444
Look at this place.
It looks like a pigsty.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.615
Did you smoke
inside the house?

18:36.698 --> 18:37.866
With Ping-ping here?

18:41.578 --> 18:42.913
Oh my God.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.672
Did you even feed Ping-ping?

18:53.340 --> 18:54.174
Yeah.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.135
Did you or not?

18:56.218 --> 18:57.803
I told you, I fed it.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.986
What a load of garbage.

19:15.779 --> 19:19.867
You're talking about dumb useless stuff
instead of telling me where that whore is.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.035
Who said I wanna hear
your sob story, bitch?

19:22.119 --> 19:23.120
Whoa, wait a minute!

19:24.705 --> 19:26.498
The next part of the story is about her.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.210
That's the truth.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.380
How could you forget that?
Care to explain?

19:33.463 --> 19:35.799
-He's a regular.
-Mr. Kim is a struggle for me.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.553
About two months ago,
that bitch started coming out to the club.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.470
Say hi to her.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.681
She's the new girl that started recently.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.909
-How old are you, darling?
-I'm 28 years old.

20:01.992 --> 20:06.496
-Oh, then you're a year older than Mi-ae.
-Wait, I'm actually 28 as well.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.166
-I lowered my age by a year.
-What?

20:09.666 --> 20:11.001
Show me your IDs, then.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.295
So we're clear about this from the get-go.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.552
CHUN-AE KIM
DOB 06/27/1983

20:20.636 --> 20:23.388
So you really were born in '83. Darling?

20:23.972 --> 20:26.099
I'm sorry, I lost my ID card.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.228
What?
Don't pull something like that.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.437
C'mon, show us.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.649
Forget it. She wouldn't
pretend to be older, after all.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.485
Just work out
how you'll address each other on your own.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.280
-What will be your stage name, hon?
-Pardon?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.991
It's not like
you'll be using your actual name.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.493
Uh…

20:47.120 --> 20:49.539
-I'll be A-reum, then.
-A-reum?

20:50.207 --> 20:51.041
That's nice.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.878

Hey.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.890
I was supposed to wear that dress.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.144
The boss told me to wear this dress today.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.271
Take it off.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.940
-C'mon, take it off!
-Hmm, damn it!

21:58.567 --> 22:01.028
What's wrong, girl?

22:09.870 --> 22:12.539
That whore even snatched
my regular customers from me.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.375
Mr. Song, you're here.
When did you get here?

22:15.459 --> 22:16.293
Huh?

22:16.793 --> 22:18.503
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

22:18.587 --> 22:22.257
-Oh, I-- I called for A-reum today.
-You're here.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.051
Hey, A-reum. You're here.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.761
Here we go!

22:29.473 --> 22:30.891
Why did you come so late?

22:30.974 --> 22:33.352
You've been coming by
more often, of course.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.734
There's something called ethics
when it comes to business.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.111
So why the hell
are you stealing my clientele?

22:43.820 --> 22:46.531
I've never stolen anyone's stuff.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.783
You haven't?

22:49.493 --> 22:52.037
Then why do my regular customers
ask for you?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.914
Why are you asking me that?

22:55.290 --> 22:57.209
If you're curious, just ask the boss?

23:01.171 --> 23:03.673
You're the bitch who led them on.
Don't drag her into this.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.802
Ow!

23:08.637 --> 23:10.931
Just stop fucking around.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.184
Seriously, you fucking slut!

23:14.267 --> 23:17.813
Stop acting like you're pretty and shit
when you got your whole face done!

23:17.896 --> 23:19.606
-Damn!
-Ow!

23:19.689 --> 23:22.317
Like you didn't
get your whole face done too.

23:22.984 --> 23:27.322
-Let go of me! Let go!
-C'mon, let go! You let go first!

23:27.406 --> 23:30.784
-You let go first!
-Wait a second-- Let go of me!

23:32.911 --> 23:33.995
Hey!

23:35.664 --> 23:37.666
On the count of three, let go.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.671
Okay, one, two, three!

23:42.754 --> 23:46.299
I knew you'd do this,
you fucking bitch--

23:46.383 --> 23:49.052
-That's what I should say--
-Hey! What are you doing?

23:49.886 --> 23:51.596
Let go, right now!

23:55.016 --> 23:56.768
Why are you two fighting?

23:56.852 --> 24:00.355
Because! She's stolen my regulars
since day one.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.609
How is that her fault, huh? Would that
have happened if you'd done better?

24:05.444 --> 24:07.237
What? C'mon!

24:07.320 --> 24:10.323
The ones with no skills
are always the ones who blame others.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.117
Uh… hold on.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.371
Now that I think about it,
I think I was in the wrong.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.626
I won't do that again, Mi-ae.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.631
Do you really wanna die?

24:26.715 --> 24:29.092
Look at you! She even apologized to you.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.345
Be the bigger person,
A-reum, will you?

24:32.429 --> 24:35.015
Her personality's all twisted,
you see. Let's go.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.274
Oh! It's fucking ridiculous.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.578
I left the club that day.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.789
And that was the last time
I saw that bitch.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.176
You think I'm gonna believe that bullshit?

25:11.259 --> 25:14.054
This really isn't me, I swear!

25:14.888 --> 25:17.057
J-- Just look! Her boobs are real.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.519
But mine are silicone implants.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.655
So this is… silicone?

25:33.448 --> 25:34.407
Fucking hell.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.577
-If you're lying, I'm gonna eat you alive.
-Ow!

25:38.495 --> 25:42.123
Listen… Just, uh--
Why would I lie to you, huh?

25:42.832 --> 25:45.210
I wanna kill that bitch as much as you do.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.007
All right.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.136
Tell me where that bitch is right now.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.728
-Hey, Jin-a!
-Ah!

26:03.812 --> 26:04.813
Hi.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.815
How've you been?

26:29.045 --> 26:30.755
-She told me she quit.
-What?

26:30.839 --> 26:31.673
Why?

26:31.756 --> 26:33.758
She might've moved
to a club with higher pay.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.428
-Where is that?
-How would I know?

26:39.431 --> 26:42.183
-Should we report her to the police?
-We can't do that.

26:43.893 --> 26:46.062
I'll end her
with my own hands. Nothing will

26:46.980 --> 26:47.856
stop me.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.319
How about I go
to the other clubs and ask around?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.322
If she's gone to a place
that pays her more,

26:55.405 --> 26:56.906
that means she's become an escort.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.992
If we search those places,
we'll be able to find her.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.037
I'll put in some legwork.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.290
That'd be nice if you do.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.668
To do that, I also need some money.

27:11.379 --> 27:12.213
Do you?

27:12.297 --> 27:15.508
-I'm missing work to do this with you.
-How much you need?

27:17.218 --> 27:18.928
-300,000 per day?
-100,000.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.930
-Two hundred.
-Get lost, now.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.307
I can find her on my own.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.478
If you look into it,
everyone will know in a split second

27:26.561 --> 27:29.064
that some weird lady's
going around looking for her.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.691
Then, for sure,
that bitch will skip town, you know.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.576
Okay, so I'll start looking around
and give you a call.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.244
Report back to me regularly.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.117
were actually…

28:22.200 --> 28:24.828
-What happened to your face?
-…all lies.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.329
Let's talk inside.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.671
Mr. Kim is a struggle for me.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.923
It was true that I met Mo-mi at the club.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.050
Oh, hello there. Say hi to her.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.219
She's the new girl that started recently.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.645
As I was talking to her,
I realized you were the same age.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.063

Our lives were so alike.

A-reum.

30:37.877 --> 30:38.837
Isn't this yours?

30:39.546 --> 30:41.381
I found it on the makeup room floor.

30:41.464 --> 30:43.132
Thank you.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.510
Where did you buy it, huh?

30:48.596 --> 30:50.223
Do you like it? Do you want it?

30:50.306 --> 30:52.475
It's okay. No, no,
that's not what I meant.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.020
Well, I… I really wanna give it to you.

30:56.104 --> 30:56.938
Come here.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.862
And there! It looks good on you.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.740
Then, one day, out of the blue,

31:08.283 --> 31:11.369
Mo-mi didn't show up at the club.
And didn't tell me.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.166
Mo-mi?

31:20.461 --> 31:22.255
Hey! What's wrong?

31:23.506 --> 31:24.340
Are you sick?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.305
Are you actually sick?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.226
Hey!

31:36.519 --> 31:37.604
You're burning up!

31:39.022 --> 31:41.149
Hey, let's go to the hospital. Now, c'mon.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.734
I'm not going.

31:43.401 --> 31:46.112
What are you talking about?
You have a fever!

31:46.613 --> 31:48.281
C'mon, get up. Hmm?

31:48.781 --> 31:52.452
Let's go to the hospital, c'mon.
You're going to die at this rate!

31:52.535 --> 31:53.494
C'mon, get up!

31:53.578 --> 31:55.371
I said I'm not going!

31:59.083 --> 32:02.086
All right, fine.
Do whatever you like, even if you die.

32:04.839 --> 32:05.757
I'm leaving.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.176
I can't go to the hospital.

32:10.845 --> 32:12.388
What are you saying?

32:15.350 --> 32:16.976
I killed a person, Chun-ae.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.313
You stupid liar.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.733
You're lying just to avoid
going to the hospital.

32:30.448 --> 32:34.577
That's when Mo-mi told me the story
she had never told anyone before.

32:35.828 --> 32:39.082
Like, why and how
she ended up here like this.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.061
What are you crying for?

33:06.401 --> 33:08.027
I wanted to protect Mo-mi.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.407
I felt that by protecting her,
I was also protecting myself.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.703
If some lady
comes to the club and asks for A-reum,

33:16.786 --> 33:18.079
tell her she left for…

33:18.162 --> 33:20.415
for some other place
to make more money, okay?

33:20.498 --> 33:23.543
Sure, of course. But why?
Who's that old woman over there?

33:23.626 --> 33:26.087
Ugh! She's trying to steal A-reum's money.

33:26.170 --> 33:29.257
-Ah, those pieces of trash.
-I'm counting on you, okay?

33:29.340 --> 33:31.050
You got it. Bye.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.930
Get out of here, quickly.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.391
That woman is gonna kill you
when she finds you.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.268
I have nowhere to go.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.521
Can't you go to your mom's place?

33:45.148 --> 33:46.232
She's still your mom.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.693
She'll help you once she knows.

33:49.777 --> 33:52.780
I told you already,
my mom's not that kind of person.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.495
She'll probably report me immediately
to the police when she sees me.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.462
What about going abroad?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.382
It's not that easy nowadays.

34:12.383 --> 34:14.719
Stowing away sounds a bit scary somehow.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.518
I'm sorry, Chun-ae.
For dragging you into this.

34:22.602 --> 34:24.270
Don't say stuff like that.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.272
Let's look for a way together.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.357
I'm sure there's a way.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.131
What's going on?
You never sleep anywhere else.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.134
So you did know I didn't come home, huh?

34:55.218 --> 34:57.345
Thought you didn't since you never called.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.264
Goodness.

35:01.724 --> 35:02.934
Did you feed Ping-ping?

35:27.834 --> 35:29.085
I'm sorry,

35:30.169 --> 35:31.963
but I would like you to leave now.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.175
Do you not hear me?

35:36.259 --> 35:38.302
I would like you to leave now.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.597
-I don't want to.
-What?

35:41.681 --> 35:44.100
I said I don't want to.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.189
This is my house.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.316
Get out, now.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.737
And what if I say I can't?

35:58.114 --> 36:01.617
I should've known
not to take in trash like you.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.830
Leave before I call the police.
If you don't leave now, I'll report you.

36:05.913 --> 36:06.831
"Trash"?

36:08.749 --> 36:10.209
You're the one who's trash.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.254
What?!

36:16.340 --> 36:18.426
You uploaded that photo, right?

36:19.927 --> 36:21.179
What do you mean?

36:21.262 --> 36:24.473
You know what.
The photo that fucked up my life.

36:26.475 --> 36:28.936
"Wgr00" is your ID, isn't it?

36:30.021 --> 36:32.523
While I was using your computer, your ID…

36:35.193 --> 36:37.361
came up as "wgr00."

36:42.867 --> 36:45.036
Were you happy that you ruined my life?

36:48.539 --> 36:49.457
That's not me.

36:50.791 --> 36:51.626
It's not you?

36:52.835 --> 36:53.753
Hmm.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.881
Fuck you!

36:58.716 --> 37:00.509
Fucking shit. Look, bitch…

37:01.093 --> 37:04.847
just thinking about what I went through
because of you back then, seriously…

37:04.931 --> 37:07.225
It's not me. I'm telling you.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.893
Don't bullshit me.

37:09.810 --> 37:13.481
I have evidence. Why you fucking around,
pretending it's not you, huh?

37:13.564 --> 37:17.985
And what did you say to me?
You want me to leave your house?

37:18.569 --> 37:20.655
C'mon, what the fuck!

37:21.155 --> 37:23.074
Crazy, the more I think about it.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.749
Listen, you fucking bitch.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.920
Even if I die, I won't leave
till I get payback for what you did.

37:36.712 --> 37:40.299
I won't hit your face, at least,
since you still have to work.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.302
But if you scream, you die.

38:05.741 --> 38:08.327
-Can I get one serving of tteokbokki?
-Sure.

38:14.083 --> 38:14.917
Huh?

38:15.668 --> 38:16.502
Hey.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.587
You're Mask Girl, aren't you?

38:22.008 --> 38:22.883
Oh, uh…

38:23.759 --> 38:25.344
It's me, Teddy.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.264
Teddy who?

38:28.347 --> 38:31.183
Mask Girl Heart Teddy, remember?
Your fan club president.

38:31.809 --> 38:35.062
Wow, this is surreal, so crazy!
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.148
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.191
N-- No?

38:39.275 --> 38:40.151
N-- Now that

38:40.776 --> 38:43.487
I'm seeing you with my own two eyes,
I know it's you.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.574
I watched your live streams so many times.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.576
I totally loved your live streams!

38:49.744 --> 38:52.330
Wow, but you became really pretty.
That's crazy.

38:52.955 --> 38:53.789
You know,

38:54.373 --> 38:56.584
I don't think
you would've ever done such a--

38:56.667 --> 38:58.252
Uh-- What?

39:08.346 --> 39:09.388
Hey!

39:10.348 --> 39:11.182
Are you okay?

39:14.643 --> 39:16.937
Uh, listen,
I know you are Mask Girl, I do.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.356
I've been looking for you!

39:19.273 --> 39:22.276
If you keep following me,
I'm gonna report you to the police.

39:22.777 --> 39:23.778
Report me!

39:24.528 --> 39:26.614
I'll totally keep it a secret
that I met you.

39:26.697 --> 39:29.575
-Mask Girl, I--
-Get lost, you stalker, before I kill you.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.347
Chun-ae.

39:53.557 --> 39:54.975
Where are you going?

39:59.021 --> 40:00.022
Let me go with you.

40:11.283 --> 40:12.493
He must be sleeping.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.788
-Get what you need and come back, Chun-ae.
-Okay.

42:44.436 --> 42:46.438
Where are you going?

42:49.817 --> 42:50.651
What?

42:56.115 --> 42:58.701
You fucking bitch,
I asked you where you were going.

43:04.832 --> 43:07.001
I was gonna take Ping-ping for a walk.

43:12.214 --> 43:14.717
You're gonna go for a walk
with a designer purse?

43:15.426 --> 43:19.054
Ah, fuck, at least use your brain
if you're gonna come up with an excuse.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.392
Jeez!

43:23.475 --> 43:26.020
You crazy bitch,
where do you think you're going?

43:37.114 --> 43:39.116
It's because you haven't been hit enough.

43:42.369 --> 43:43.579
-Fuck!
-No, Ping-ping!

43:43.662 --> 43:45.039
Fucking mutt!

43:45.122 --> 43:47.458
You trash! I'm gonna kill you!

43:47.541 --> 43:49.126
Fuck off, you crazy asshole!

43:50.628 --> 43:51.545
Die!

43:56.675 --> 43:58.427
Oh, you fucking bitch. Come here!

43:58.510 --> 44:02.222
You ugly piece of shit. I played with you
cause you fixed your face.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.350
Think you can mess with me,
you fucking bitch?

44:04.433 --> 44:05.309
Know your damn place!

44:07.603 --> 44:09.313
A bitch like you needs to die.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.735
Die, you fucking bitch.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.362
Ah, you bitch!

44:23.911 --> 44:25.954
Fuck!

44:52.606 --> 44:54.358
Who the fuck is that fucking bitch?

45:03.701 --> 45:06.453
Ow! Oh, fuck.

45:21.218 --> 45:23.053
D-- Damn it!

45:30.185 --> 45:32.688
Fuck. Fuck.

45:41.613 --> 45:43.240
The other way.

46:31.705 --> 46:34.124
CHUN-AE KIM

46:40.964 --> 46:43.467
The number you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

46:43.550 --> 46:45.677
-Please leave a message…
-That sly bitch.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.930
Did she run away?

46:55.103 --> 46:56.730
MG LOVE
MESSAGE RECEIVED 5

46:56.814 --> 46:58.023
What is this?

46:58.649 --> 47:00.818
MG LOVE! MESSAGE ME!
CRAZY THING HAPPENED!!!

47:02.528 --> 47:04.238
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

47:08.867 --> 47:11.161
SHE MET UP WITH SOMEONE
IN FRONT OF THE MART

47:16.750 --> 47:19.211
I MET THIS WOMAN TODAY
BOOBS CONFIRMED SHE'S THE REAL MASK GIRL!

47:26.510 --> 47:28.262
GIRL WE THOUGHT WAS MASK GIRL
AND REAL MASK GIRL KNOW EACH OTHER

47:28.345 --> 47:29.388
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

47:31.265 --> 47:32.266
Shit!

47:33.308 --> 47:35.477
I'm gonna kill that--

47:36.603 --> 47:37.437
Shit.

47:49.449 --> 47:50.409
Oh, shit.

48:03.630 --> 48:04.840
Those bitches.

48:18.770 --> 48:20.188
So where do you wanna go?

48:22.441 --> 48:24.067
Wherever the road leads.

48:27.404 --> 48:29.072
Is there somewhere you wanna go?

48:31.992 --> 48:34.328
Not really. I don't think so.

48:40.375 --> 48:41.501
I think I'm pregnant.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.590
Pregnant? Really?

48:49.217 --> 48:50.218
Whose child is it?

48:52.095 --> 48:53.764
Is it Oh-nam… Ju…

49:01.188 --> 49:02.522
What are you gonna do now?

49:05.317 --> 49:06.318
I'm gonna have it.

49:07.069 --> 49:11.114
Are you crazy? How are you gonna
raise the baby given your situation?

49:13.617 --> 49:14.451
No idea.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.536
I'm sure it'll work out.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.046
I wonder if it'll be ugly.

49:28.340 --> 49:30.676
When it's an adult,
it can get plastic surgery.

49:35.639 --> 49:36.974
I'm gonna

49:37.724 --> 49:39.101
tell them that they're pretty.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.689
My mom never told me
I was pretty growing up.

49:43.772 --> 49:44.856
Not even once.

49:46.775 --> 49:48.276
Even if the baby's ugly,

49:50.404 --> 49:51.905
I'm gonna tell them they're pretty.

51:34.883 --> 51:36.551
She's that lady I told you about.

51:40.806 --> 51:42.599
I've been waiting for this day.

51:44.017 --> 51:47.145
And I can't believe my eyes,
you disgusting bitches.

51:51.983 --> 51:54.194
You deserve to die painfully, bitch.

51:56.446 --> 51:58.615
Is this how you dealt with my son as well?

51:59.616 --> 52:03.161
Yeah! Your son, that fucking pervert,

52:03.245 --> 52:04.079
I killed him.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.164
What are you doing?

52:07.415 --> 52:08.542
She's lying.

52:08.625 --> 52:11.294
-I killed him. I did.
-Lady, it's me! I did it.

52:12.087 --> 52:12.921
I'm Mo-mi Kim.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.382
I'm the one who murdered your son.

52:15.465 --> 52:19.094
No, I killed your son!
I'm Mo-mi Kim, all right!

52:20.887 --> 52:22.973
Look at you two pulling this bullshit.

52:24.224 --> 52:25.475
It doesn't really matter.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.103
I was gonna murder you both regardless.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.610
What's going on?

52:36.528 --> 52:39.281
This-- This fucking pile of scrap metal.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.051
Chun-ae!

53:06.474 --> 53:07.475
Chun-ae!

53:16.902 --> 53:18.361
You fucking bitch.

53:19.696 --> 53:20.530
Shit!

53:23.366 --> 53:24.492
Die, bitch!

53:27.996 --> 53:30.665
Oh, goodness.
I can do it. I can get to it!

53:54.564 --> 53:56.191
Die, you devil!

54:05.784 --> 54:11.039
I'll cut you up in tiny pieces
like you did to my son.

54:29.599 --> 54:30.433
Chun-ae!

54:37.440 --> 54:40.277
Get up. Let's go now, c'mon.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.326
Let's go, c'mon!

54:51.830 --> 54:54.833
Chun-ae! Look at me. Look at me.

54:57.085 --> 54:57.919
Wake up.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.718
No. No, no! Please…

55:04.801 --> 55:05.885
No, please.

57:10.718 --> 57:12.804
Wow, you're a star. A real star.

57:13.805 --> 57:16.182
We'll be exiting now.
Opening the door.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.821
-Mask Girl!
-Stand back, please.

57:30.697 --> 57:34.242
The crowd and cameras
that only existed in my fantasies.

57:35.618 --> 57:39.581
A flood of flashlights,
and a stage prepared just for me.

57:40.957 --> 57:44.377
Everyone's eyes and interest
all focused on me.

57:45.253 --> 57:47.714
I dreamed of this for so long.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.483
Mask Girl!
