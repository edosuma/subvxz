only one thing that I can do,

I had a fiancé. He died.

Car accident. I was driving.

Did you kill him?

What?

00:28.075 --> 00:30.442
Chet, what the hell are you doing here?

00:30.478 --> 00:31.943
I'm taking my kingdom back.

He is the one in charge now.

lean into what Chet's doing.

be like... Hello, ladies.

- Nice to see you. Looking super.
- Chet. Chet.

insurance policy on his body.

He can't even play a
game of pickup basketball.

01:34.675 --> 01:35.573
Pickup basketball?

01:35.574 --> 01:37.373
So there's no way he's coming close

01:37.408 --> 01:39.575
to an explosion or an ATV.

01:39.610 --> 01:41.678
Hey. Your body is not a commodity.

You tell you what you do with you.

01:43.782 --> 01:46.582
Chet, first of all, my body
is a commodity, okay?

01:46.617 --> 01:49.786
It's my living. Funny thing
I plan on protecting it.

01:51.289 --> 01:53.722
This is a disaster.

01:53.757 --> 01:55.057
Yeah, but I mean,

what are we gonna do about it, you know?

and now we're stuck with it.

02:12.776 --> 02:14.609
The ATVs are ripping up the lawn,

02:14.644 --> 02:17.212
there's a gaggle of lost
girls in their underwear,

02:17.247 --> 02:19.181
and not a hint of romance in sight.

02:19.216 --> 02:20.682

02:20.718 --> 02:22.450
Quinn, I am not a threat here.

02:22.485 --> 02:25.553
The network just put me in
charge to get us back on track.

02:25.589 --> 02:27.355
And you're the expert, huh?

balls even dropped yet,

that to look forward to?

won all those awards,

war for my services,

wouldn't be doing this to me.

middle of the first episode.

38:07.544 --> 38:11.413
Said you and Chet had no
idea what you were doing,

38:11.449 --> 38:13.615
wanted me to send both of you home,

38:13.650 --> 38:15.851
let her run the show all by herself.

38:15.886 --> 38:18.253
That's why Coleman's here.

38:18.289 --> 38:19.254
Mm.

38:19.290 --> 38:20.489
Hmm.

38:22.126 --> 38:24.993
You want your hands back on the reins?

38:25.028 --> 38:27.996
Get control of your people, Quinn.

38:29.967 --> 38:32.300
Oh, I will.

38:32.335 --> 38:34.168
Believe me, I will.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.441
Coleman: Hey, Rachel. Hey.

38:40.477 --> 38:41.775
Can you get out?

38:41.811 --> 38:43.444
What... What's wrong?

38:43.480 --> 38:46.114
Quinn... she just, like,
found out about Gary, and um...

38:46.149 --> 38:47.281
Rachel, come on.

38:47.317 --> 38:48.716
No, she's gonna, like, chop me up

38:48.751 --> 38:50.184
into millions of little pieces.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.186
They're gonna ship me off
to different countries.

38:52.222 --> 38:53.454
- Rachel. Rachel.
- Yeah.

38:53.490 --> 38:54.955
You don't need Quinn.

38:56.514 --> 38:57.653
Don't you get that?

38:57.653 --> 38:59.693
I watched you work today.
You were incredible.

38:59.729 --> 39:02.630
I mean, Quinn and
Chet, they're dinosaurs.

39:02.665 --> 39:04.131
Sure, they can run this show.

39:04.166 --> 39:06.534
They can run "Everlasting."
That's all they can do.

39:06.569 --> 39:09.314
Between you and me, we can make shows

39:09.314 --> 39:11.772
that actually mean something,
shows that people need.

39:17.346 --> 39:18.678
Ah.

39:20.349 --> 39:22.115
Sorry. Too soon.

39:23.218 --> 39:24.584
I'm sor...

39:34.128 --> 39:36.595
Madison: Rachel, where are you?
Darius says he needs you.

39:36.630 --> 39:39.031
Oh, God. I have to go. Right now.

39:39.067 --> 39:40.499
I'm coming, I'm coming.

39:40.535 --> 39:41.733
Not, like, coming like that.

39:41.769 --> 39:43.202
I'm not going anywhere.

39:43.237 --> 39:44.670
- Rachel.
- Go.

39:52.438 --> 39:54.219
[ Baby babbles ]

40:00.654 --> 40:03.722
There's my boy.

40:06.594 --> 40:08.393
Darius, it's Rachel.

40:08.428 --> 40:09.794
Darius: Yeah. Come in.

40:12.731 --> 40:14.315
You okay.

40:14.634 --> 40:17.168
Shut the door.
