00:01.801 --> 00:03.496
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

00:03.536 --> 00:07.563
Surgical training protocol
is officially changing, people.

00:07.607 --> 00:10.235
Thought you'd defend your
boyfriend to me and I'd take it?

00:10.276 --> 00:11.504
He's not my boyfriend.

00:11.544 --> 00:12.909
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.039
You and Derek will not work.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.208
Why do you care what I think?

00:17.250 --> 00:20.185
If I'm gonna do this
with him, I need you to cheer me on.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.516
<i>As surgeons,</i>
<i>we are trained to fix what's broken.</i>

00:27.560 --> 00:30.051
I'm in a hurry. I can't stay.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.859
Chief's having a big meeting,

00:31.898 --> 00:35.265
but I wanted to tell you
that I'm finished with therapy.

00:35.301 --> 00:38.828
<i>The breaking point</i>
<i>is our starting line at work.</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:41.466
Meredith, you are not finished.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.536
You have worked incredibly hard.
Look how far you've come.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.308
- You're scratching the surface.
- Derek's moved in

00:48.348 --> 00:51.511
- and we've taken it to the next level.
- It's not about Derek.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.011
- I'm happy.
- You're not done.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.614
I am happy. Isn't that the point?

00:56.656 --> 00:57.680
No.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.716
<i>But in our lives, the</i>
<i>breaking point is a sign of weakness.</i>

01:00.760 --> 01:03.593
- I need you to stay. I know.
- The meeting, the Chief.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.257
Thank you, Dr. Wyatt.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.266
Thanks for everything.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.030
<i>And we'll do</i>
<i>everything we can to avoid it.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:17.073
Whoa!

01:17.110 --> 01:19.078
- Sorry.
- What are you doing in here?

01:19.112 --> 01:21.945
Thinking about making this my office
when you move out.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.279
When I move out?
When am I moving out?

01:24.317 --> 01:26.342
Oh. Soon?

01:28.588 --> 01:29.850
Mmm.

01:29.889 --> 01:32.756
You know Meredith was planning
on making us move out?

01:32.792 --> 01:34.953
- I'm busy here.
- Join us if you want.

01:34.994 --> 01:36.222
No!

01:37.664 --> 01:40.360
When were you planning
on telling us we had to move?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.732
When did you plan to tell them
they had to move?

01:42.769 --> 01:45.203
- Why do they have to move?
- I made this for you.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.832
It's a zoo, a frathouse.
Alex and his parade of women.

01:47.874 --> 01:50.604
- His parade of skanks.
- Am I apartment hunting?

01:50.643 --> 01:52.440
I don't know. I have to think about it.

01:52.479 --> 01:55.380
Just eat the muffin, Mer.
Taste the muffin.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.178
Remember the muffin.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.644
- I like my roommates.
- I like them too.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.053
That was your life. This is our life,

02:03.089 --> 02:05.819
and I'm excited about
building our life together.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.089
Come on. It's gonna be great.

02:17.237 --> 02:20.263
So Derek wants Alex and Izzie
to move out.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.672
Since when does he say "jump"
and you jump?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.405
Well, I'm happy.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.606
They'll be pissed off.

02:28.781 --> 02:30.749
But do whatever you want.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.185
Hey, you hear anything about
what the new rules are?

02:36.523 --> 02:39.549
Last I heard you were at
hand-holding, foot rubs,

02:39.592 --> 02:41.617
and lots of late-night gab sessions.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.358
- Excuse me?
- Listen up, everyone.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.764
You're talking about
the Chief's new rules.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.462
- Thought it was you and Torres.
- Listen up!

02:50.503 --> 02:52.266
I've been wrong before.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.773
We're busy people,
I'm gonna try and be brief.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.641
I am implementing a new teaching
protocol here at Seattle Grace.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.308
Some of these rules are new,

03:03.349 --> 03:06.682
and some are old and are
going to be newly enforced.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.579
Jack O'Brien, 47.

03:09.622 --> 03:12.455
Scheduled for an abdominal
aortic aneurysm repair.

03:12.492 --> 03:16.326
His last CT showed calcification.
So I ordered a CT angio

03:16.362 --> 03:19.263
to determine if it had worsened
or remained stable.

03:19.299 --> 03:22.063
Nice catch, Yang. You can
take him down after rounds.

03:22.101 --> 03:25.593
Dr. Karev will take over. Dr. Yang,
you're done here. Thank you.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.431
First,
second and third-year residents

03:29.475 --> 03:32.638
will no longer be allowed
to de facto specialize.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.079
The practice interferes
with the development

03:35.114 --> 03:37.810
of a fully-rounded surgical education.
No more.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.613
Barry Patmore, 63.

03:39.652 --> 03:43.349
Has been experiencing chronic
headaches for the past seven years.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.825
Has been treated with narcotics,
anti-seizure medications,

03:46.859 --> 03:51.228
antidepressants, and anti-psychotic
medications with no success.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.495
How severe is the pain today,
Mr. Patmore, scale of one to ten?

03:54.534 --> 03:56.968
Eight. It's always an eight.

03:57.003 --> 04:01.201
Which is why Mr. Patmore's last consult
suggested a bilateral cingulotomy.

04:01.241 --> 04:06.645
- A frontal lobotomy for a headache?
- Too loud. Please.

04:06.679 --> 04:09.239
And could you do something
about the buzzing?

04:09.282 --> 04:13.013
Do we need all these machines?

04:13.753 --> 04:17.314
Mr. Patmore has been
experiencing pain all day every day

04:17.357 --> 04:18.380
for seven years.

04:18.423 --> 04:23.919
But a cingulotomy could cause seizures,
cognitive defects or behavioral changes.

04:23.963 --> 04:27.262
Which is why we are going to explore
every possible option

04:27.300 --> 04:29.598
before resorting to such
a radical surgery.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.866
- More tests?
- Yes.

04:32.505 --> 04:35.474
Dr. Yang, you'll be assisting
Dr. Shepherd today.

04:36.542 --> 04:40.342
Personal relationships,
personal loyalties

04:40.380 --> 04:44.544
and personal favorites will no longer
be a factor in our training program.

04:44.584 --> 04:48.748
Attendings, you will spread
your wealth of knowledge equally

04:48.788 --> 04:50.688
among all of the residents.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.021
In addition,
we'll refocus our attention

04:53.059 --> 04:56.551
on patient communication
and bedside manner. For some of us,

04:56.596 --> 05:01.226
this means learning the lost art
of humanity and compassion.

05:01.267 --> 05:04.566
For others, this means
learning how to treat patients

05:04.604 --> 05:08.370
without becoming
emotionally involved with them.

05:08.408 --> 05:11.571
Shelley Boden, 30, stage four
colon cancer with liver mets.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.546
Shelley has been through
extensive chemo and radiation.

05:14.580 --> 05:18.380
According to the CT,
a liver resection could be curative.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.682
Will be curative. Will.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.120
Do you have any other questions for us?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.989
What happens if you find
more cancer than you expect?

05:26.025 --> 05:28.459
No, Jen. A, that's not gonna happen.

05:28.494 --> 05:32.692
And B, Izzie's already answered
all of your questions three times.

05:32.732 --> 05:37.066
- Izzie's not the main surgeon.
- Izzie's awesome. We love Izzie.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.537
This is Dr. Grey.
She'll prep you for surgery

05:39.572 --> 05:41.631
and answer any questions you have.

05:41.674 --> 05:45.075
- Izzie's not staying?
- This is a surgical program.

05:45.111 --> 05:49.275
Psychiatry is on the fifth floor.
Let's not confuse the two.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.613
In addition, residents,

05:52.652 --> 05:55.485
your interns reflect on you.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.280
If they fail, you fail.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.952
If they succeed, you succeed.

06:00.993 --> 06:04.429
Attendings, that goes
for residents as well.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.424
Teach with enthusiasm.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.368
Learn with enthusiasm.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.035
We are surgeons.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.370
We cut out malignancies.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.933
Let's start at home.

06:22.248 --> 06:25.376
O'Malley? This is Dr. Bennett Epstein.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.784
He'll be your proctor
for the exam today.

06:29.956 --> 06:32.390
- You're about ready, O'Malley?
- Yes, sir.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.189
You have three hours from
the moment you open the test.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.924
Once you break this seal,
you may not leave the room

06:37.964 --> 06:40.455
until you have completed
the entire exam.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.866
- Good luck, O'Malley.
- Thank you, sir.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.540
I can do this.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.013
I'm not married and cheating on my wife
with my best friend.

06:56.516 --> 06:59.007
Everything's just as it should be.

07:11.497 --> 07:14.466
Oh!

07:15.535 --> 07:17.002
Damn chair.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.401
Hang on.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.431
- Looks like the wheel's broken.
- That's how things work around me.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.102
My toaster broke last month.

07:24.143 --> 07:26.907
Then my cat ran away
and my back porch collapsed.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.437
Also, my TV only shows the color green.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.915
I'll get another chair.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.648
Don't bother. I'll walk. Probably safer.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.949
No. Mr. O'Brien,
you need to stay in the chair.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.619
- It's hospital policy.
- I had three car accidents...

07:43.763 --> 07:48.393
Mr. O'Brien.
Somebody get me a gurney over here!

07:54.907 --> 07:58.308
- Sir, I am very sorry.
- I hit my head.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.369
I am very, very sorry.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.246
Get him a CT. I want hourly updates
on his condition.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.477
- Yes, sir.
- You're gonna be OK.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.357
Mike, my ceiling's raining here.

08:13.392 --> 08:16.225
Looks like a pipe burst.
Gotta turn off the water...

08:16.262 --> 08:17.820
No. This is a surgical floor.

08:17.864 --> 08:21.493
Water's required to scrub and clean
equipment to keep people alive.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.525
- Fix this with the water on.
- I can try.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.934
Keep me posted.

08:39.150 --> 08:44.953
Chief, there is some kind of leak
in the conference room.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.685
You don't say.

08:47.627 --> 08:51.723
I was wondering if there was
anywhere else I could take the exam.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.394
I will find a different room on my own.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.530
Thank you, sir.

09:06.412 --> 09:08.346
We have a problem.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.815
Mark Sloan has found us out.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.776
Mark's known from the beginning.
I told him.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.287
He's Mark Sloan.

09:16.322 --> 09:19.155
You don't have a person
you talk to about things?

09:19.191 --> 09:21.386
You are the person
I talk to about things.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.588
I like to keep my private life private

09:23.629 --> 09:26.564
from everyone, but
most definitely from Mark...

09:28.200 --> 09:29.827
...Sloan.

09:38.444 --> 09:42.039
- How long will the operation be?
- At least a couple of hours.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.480
Think it could be longer?

09:43.516 --> 09:46.679
If there are complications
or the mets are more extensive.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.947
They won't be, Jen.

09:47.987 --> 09:51.218
Jen, please, stop. Call Mom
and Dad, tell them two hours.

09:58.497 --> 10:02.365
Since I got cancer, my sister's
only capable of talking about cancer,

10:02.401 --> 10:04.528
which is so much worse than the cancer.

10:04.570 --> 10:07.004
So I know I don't know you, but spill.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.867
- Spill what?
- Anything.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.070
I'm begging you,

10:12.111 --> 10:16.070
before she comes back and asks you
to describe my liver cell by cell.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.139
Please.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.878
OK. Um...

10:21.921 --> 10:25.413
Do you want to hear about
my stupid boss or stupid boyfriend?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.689
Oh! Boyfriend! Definitely the boyfriend.

10:28.794 --> 10:32.195
Mr. Patmore, I'm gonna give you
a variety of different stimuli

10:32.231 --> 10:35.462
so we can take a look
at the wave patterns generated.

10:35.501 --> 10:38.629
I need you to remove your hand
from your eyes now.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.098
OK. Are we still at an eight?

10:41.741 --> 10:44.437
- It's still at eight.
- OK.

10:44.944 --> 10:49.881
Starting visual stimuli.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.856
If you were me you'd want them out.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.380
The roommates.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.893
- I'm not being unreasonable.
- Pulse is coming down.

11:02.928 --> 11:05.829
But you have to admit,
you'd want them out.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.925
If you were me, you would want them out.

11:13.105 --> 11:14.902
If we have to operate,

11:14.940 --> 11:17.408
I'll let you drill the burr holes
by yourself.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.672
Fine. I'd want them out. Whatever.

11:23.315 --> 11:24.873
I knew it.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.282
OK, Mr. Patmore.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.516
OK, we're gonna change your position.

11:31.323 --> 11:34.690
- Dr. Yang, I think I have an idea...
- No, don't think. Know.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.695
Run to the lab for his test results.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.695
But Izzie bakes and Alex fixes things.

11:42.735 --> 11:45.704
OK, when I am no longer Cancer Girl

11:45.738 --> 11:48.969
and I can go out and meet a hot doctor
who rocks my world

11:49.008 --> 11:53.570
and wants to move in with me, I might
forego the baked goods and repair work.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.538
Ooh. Heads up. Twelve o'clock.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.717
Just so you know, Cristina thinks
you should move them out. Talk to her.

12:02.822 --> 12:06.053
Dude, you failed to mention the hair.

12:06.092 --> 12:07.389
Yeah, yeah, the hair.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.054
It's one of the many things
that makes me happy.

12:10.096 --> 12:14.863
Dr. Sloan, I'm working with Shepherd
today on a pain patient,

12:14.900 --> 12:18.063
and I read this article
while I helping George study...

12:18.104 --> 12:19.594
Pathetic.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.272
Yes. I know, I'm pathetic.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.472
I did read this article.
I do have a photographic memory.

12:26.512 --> 12:29.504
Chief's on his new thing
with the interns to be heard...

12:29.548 --> 12:32.813
- Use fewer words, Grey.
- I think he needs an ENT.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.111
You're an ENT, right?

12:36.455 --> 12:38.685
How are you doing in there,
Mr. O'Brien?

12:39.792 --> 12:43.785
Could be worse. Could have brain
leaking from my ears.

12:43.829 --> 12:47.390
That's the spirit. It'll only take
a couple more minutes. Hang on.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.568
Guess what I found. An apartment.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.595
A beautiful apartment.

12:53.639 --> 12:56.403
With hardwood floors
and an honest-to-God fireplace

12:56.442 --> 12:58.876
that you can build
honest-to-God fires in...

12:58.911 --> 13:01.243
...and I can't afford it by myself.

13:01.280 --> 13:06.445
So... I thought if you could get over
yourself we could live together.

13:08.420 --> 13:09.910
No, thanks.

13:11.423 --> 13:14.824
I mention the hardwood floors,
the honest-to-God fireplace?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.987
I'd rather live in my honest-to-God car.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.526
Right.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.866
How's he doing?
Think we're looking at a lawsuit?

13:31.911 --> 13:34.709
No, we don't have a picture yet,
but... no.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.079
This guy doesn't seem like
the lawsuit type.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.811
Let's hope you're right.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.693
Hello?

13:59.605 --> 14:00.970
Hello?

14:02.541 --> 14:05.635
I cannot apologize enough.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.146
Treat him like a king.
Hear that, Mr. O'Brien?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.546
Dr. Karev is going to take
great care of you.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.484
You are our number one priority today.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.316
- Are you OK?
- God hates me.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.187
- Mr. O'Brien...
- My wife left me.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.385
My accountant stole from me.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.520
The store I worked at burned down.

14:24.830 --> 14:28.732
I was diagnosed with an aneurysm
for which I'd require surgery

14:28.767 --> 14:32.294
in a hospital that seems to be
crumbling around me.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.999
God hates me.

14:36.642 --> 14:39.736
You can see the remaining tumors
easily identified here.

14:39.778 --> 14:42.008
Her liver looks so healthy.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.572
That's the beauty of general surgery.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.949
See badness surrounded by goodness.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.217
Cut out the badness,
all's right with the world.

14:50.256 --> 14:53.089
It's just you and your scalpel,

14:53.125 --> 14:56.754
one on one, <i>mano a mano.</i>

14:59.465 --> 15:01.956
OK, this is me teaching with enthusiasm.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.302
Oh...

15:08.340 --> 15:10.365
Oh, no.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.111
- O'Malley.
- What?!

15:22.221 --> 15:26.658
Um... if you're
finished with your test...

15:26.692 --> 15:29.752
Look, the hospital's flooding.
The CT's on the fritz,

15:29.795 --> 15:32.730
my post-op and pre-op patients
are backed up for days,

15:32.765 --> 15:34.596
I gotta get a handle on this thing

15:34.633 --> 15:38.069
before the patients find out and
our ranking drops way past 12.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.732
I found a nice, quiet room in Psych
for you to take your exam.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.638
Oh, I see. Um...

15:45.444 --> 15:47.139
No, you go ahead.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.483
Chief!

15:55.454 --> 15:58.218
I am your intern
at least for one more day.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.554
I can help.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.154
- Dr. Shepherd, a word.
- Excuse me. Yes?

16:07.032 --> 16:09.796
You mind if I run a quick test
on your patient?

16:09.835 --> 16:12.804
He's in a lot of pain. I don't think
he needs a tummy tuck.

16:12.838 --> 16:16.239
That's funny. No, Dr. Grey
came to me with an interesting idea.

16:16.275 --> 16:19.972
Unlike you, I'm taking the Chief's
new teaching protocol seriously

16:20.012 --> 16:21.377
so I listened.

16:21.413 --> 16:25.110
I read a thing about swelling and
compression of the ethmoid nerve.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.449
I believe if we were to stick
a cottle elevator up his nose...

16:28.487 --> 16:29.852
I'm sorry, up his nose?

16:29.888 --> 16:33.654
If Dr. Grey is on the right track,
the patient will let us know.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.525
OK.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.229
Mr. Patmore, I'm Dr. Sloan,

16:39.264 --> 16:42.358
head of plastic surgery and
an ear, nose and throat specialist.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.733
I'd like to run a test
with your permission.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.000
I've seen 16 ENT's.
Not one could help me.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.440
Now breathe normally.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.538
I'm gonna angle this into here.

16:55.914 --> 16:59.350
Let me know when you feel
any... pain or anything.

16:59.385 --> 17:03.822
That's it. That's the pain!

17:03.856 --> 17:06.154
That's what's causing the pain.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.092
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.759
Anterior ethmoid neurovascular complex.

17:16.801 --> 17:20.169
A simple middle turbinectomy
will fix it.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.071
Unless you still want to chop out
the front of his brain.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.901
Nicely done.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.050
Hi.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.552
How'd it go?

17:41.593 --> 17:43.026
Hi, Shelley.

17:44.696 --> 17:49.895
We found that the mets were much
more extensive than the CT detected,

17:49.935 --> 17:54.395
and the main tumor
actually extended in and around

17:54.440 --> 17:57.273
the major blood vessel behind the liver.

17:57.309 --> 18:00.073
We're gonna start a
new round of chemo, that's all.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.205
I already have a call in
to your oncologist.

18:02.247 --> 18:07.344
That's him. I'll be right back.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.288
We can manage your pain.

18:13.325 --> 18:16.021
I'm sorry we don't have better news.

18:32.744 --> 18:36.703
So did you decide what to do
about your roommates?

18:41.220 --> 18:43.120
I'm so sorry, Shelley.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.314
Come on.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.596
So how good is the hot boyfriend in bed?

19:03.642 --> 19:07.134
Look, we don't even know
what we are yet.

19:07.179 --> 19:10.876
So how does Mark Sloan know?

19:11.717 --> 19:15.414
Why are you talking to him
instead of me?

19:17.122 --> 19:18.487
Ladies.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.452
Am I interrupting?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.963
- Your timing is perfect.
- Really?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.296
Were you about to feel her up?

19:31.937 --> 19:34.098
- Stop. You have to stop.
- I can't.

19:34.139 --> 19:36.664
- Seriously, she hates it.
- That's why I can't.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.973
- Don't... You want a spanking? I...
- OK?

19:43.081 --> 19:45.675
You told Derek you think
I should kick them out?

19:45.717 --> 19:48.185
No. No, I...

19:49.087 --> 19:51.453
I told him I would want them out.
Me, not you.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.084
I only said it because
he wouldn't stop talking.

19:54.126 --> 19:58.028
You don't think I should? I think I'm
going to. It's the adult thing to do.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.588
- What does your shrink say?
- I quit my shrink.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.900
- I'm happy. We're happy.
- Can I sit here?

20:06.305 --> 20:09.001
George... George, how did it go?

20:11.777 --> 20:15.577
There's a water problem.
I'm just trying to help the Chief.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.208
Now the medical facts
are falling out of my ear.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.013
Eat this, it's brain food.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.147
My dude with the aneurysm?

20:23.188 --> 20:25.918
Fell in the water, smacked his head,
got stuck in the CT.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.052
My patient's dying. I hate it
when I like them and they're dying.

20:29.094 --> 20:32.689
Our guy's been living in pain at
a constant eight the last seven years

20:32.731 --> 20:34.892
because of an inflamed nerve
in his nose.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.958
I wish I had an inflamed nerve.

20:37.002 --> 20:40.438
There is no way that guy's been
living at an eight. He's a wimp.

20:40.472 --> 20:42.531
His eight? My three. I can take pain.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.042
You can't talk to my boyfriend
for ten minutes.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.513
There's pain and then there's torture.
I can take pain. Test me.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.744
- Nothing.
- Impressive.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.947
Shut up! You barely touched her.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.882
- Ow!
- Ow! No! No!

20:59.925 --> 21:02.951
- Knock it off! Stop it!
- How did you diagnose that nerve?

21:02.995 --> 21:05.589
Because I've never heard
of that condition.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.725
I remembered an article
from the British journal of ENT.

21:08.767 --> 21:13.136
It was issue 47, page 19, from 1964.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.639
A photographic memory.

21:15.674 --> 21:16.971
Dude. Lexipedia.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.842
- Oh, I hate you.
- Don't hate me. I can help you.

21:24.149 --> 21:26.379
Chief, what's going on with the flood?

21:26.418 --> 21:29.478
It's not a flood, Bailey.
It's a pipe that...

21:29.521 --> 21:32.081
It's minor, OK? Not to worry.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.149
Aren't you headed to surgery?

21:34.192 --> 21:35.557
Yes, sir.

21:36.995 --> 21:39.190
Chief, a few months ago

21:39.231 --> 21:42.598
little Tuck flushed one of his
action figures down the toilet.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.602
I thought it was no big deal. Minor.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.366
But then I came home to a kitchen

21:47.406 --> 21:49.874
filled with several inches
of poop water.

21:51.343 --> 21:54.107
- Poop water?
- In my kitchen, sir.

21:56.415 --> 21:59.509
Thank you, Dr. Bailey,
but I have this under control.

22:00.385 --> 22:01.613
Yes, sir.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.521
Poop water.

22:06.058 --> 22:09.858
Hey. Hey. So apparently
there's some kind of leak.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.955
Chief wants me to move
the pre-op patients to the clinic.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.590
Who's free to help me...? Ow!

22:14.633 --> 22:17.295
- What the hell?
- Not a high pain threshold?

22:17.336 --> 22:20.032
You know what? Throw him out.
Not me, just him.

22:20.072 --> 22:23.064
- She likes me more.
- I bake for everyone and I clean.

22:23.108 --> 22:26.874
The only thing you bring to the house
is filth. What would you prefer,

22:26.912 --> 22:28.675
chocolate cake or an STD?

22:29.915 --> 22:32.179
Water!

22:32.217 --> 22:34.481
- Get out, get out.
- Where is this coming from?

22:34.553 --> 22:37.181
- Get the Chief.
- Let's keep going.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.786
Post-ops to rooms 2415.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.661
Pre-ops to rooms 2233, 4 and 5.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.995
- The overflow goes into the clinic.
- OK.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.398
Chief!

22:49.434 --> 22:51.595
I got everything under control up here.

22:51.636 --> 22:54.867
I need you to oversee Stevens
with the pre-ops in the clinic.

22:54.906 --> 22:58.103
Sir, maybe we need to shut down.

22:58.143 --> 23:00.907
Just send the patients
to Mercy West, Seattle Pres.

23:00.946 --> 23:04.109
They can repair the pipe.
We'll be up and running in no time.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.447
I am sending our patients to dry ground.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.180
I closed all but two ORs.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.917
Maintenance has isolated the broken
pipe, so thank you, Dr. Bailey.

23:11.957 --> 23:15.358
When I say I've got it under control
that's what I mean.

23:15.394 --> 23:19.160
Sir, they may have isolated it,
but a lot of water got out.

23:19.197 --> 23:22.132
- I'm just saying...
- Dr. Bailey, clinic now!

23:25.837 --> 23:28.533
Yes, sir. On my way.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.435
Slow down!

23:35.781 --> 23:37.681
OK, what next?

23:38.283 --> 23:40.478
Wait. Are you sure
you have time for this?

23:40.519 --> 23:42.646
I want you to get to take your test.

23:42.687 --> 23:44.052
- Thank you.
- Grey.

23:45.924 --> 23:50.827
Despite your unfortunate taste in men,
turns out you're not entirely useless.

23:50.862 --> 23:54.093
Mr. Patmore's condition
is extremely rare...

23:54.132 --> 23:56.430
...and you nailed it.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.629
You can scrub in.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.696
Now? You're doing the surgery now,
with the flood?

24:01.740 --> 24:04.971
Flood's contained. Our man's
been in pain for seven years.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.637
See you in surgery.

24:06.678 --> 24:09.647
I can't. I'm sorry. Um...

24:09.681 --> 24:14.345
But I'm really busy helping the Chief...
the Chief's intern.

24:14.386 --> 24:17.014
I... Thank you, but maybe next time?

24:17.055 --> 24:19.717
No, Lassie, there won't be a next time.

24:21.159 --> 24:22.387
Pathetic.

24:23.361 --> 24:25.522
Mr. Patmore, I'm gonna draw some blood

24:25.564 --> 24:28.931
and place a topical decongestant
before I take you to surgery.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.332
Absolutely, of course.

24:31.503 --> 24:33.596
How's your pain level now?

24:34.172 --> 24:35.537
Eight.

24:36.374 --> 24:38.069
It's always at eight.

24:38.109 --> 24:41.044
Oh. It looked like you had some relief.

24:42.914 --> 24:45.007
I've spent seven years.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.348
I've seen 39 doctors.

24:49.054 --> 24:52.353
I've tried every kind of painkiller
and nothing helps.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.154
I've had doctors tell me
it's my imagination...

24:56.928 --> 24:58.828
...that I'm crazy.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.832
Called me a drug addict.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.102
My wife died last year.

25:12.277 --> 25:17.044
After spending years carting me around
to doctor after doctor, test after test,

25:17.082 --> 25:18.777
she died.

25:21.486 --> 25:23.647
She was my best friend.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.990
She was my favorite person in the...

25:28.894 --> 25:30.521
And she died.

25:32.898 --> 25:35.059
But I couldn't feel it.

25:38.503 --> 25:40.061
I couldn't feel that pain

25:40.105 --> 25:43.666
because I was so completely
occupied with this one.

25:46.378 --> 25:50.007
And now I finally know what's wrong
and Dr. Sloan is gonna fix it

25:50.048 --> 25:53.074
so you're right, you're right,

25:53.118 --> 25:55.018
that I'm feeling some relief.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.218
OK, let's get your blood drawn.

26:05.163 --> 26:07.757
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna have surgery.

26:07.799 --> 26:10.063
It's just gonna hurt.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.763
She's gonna slice me in half
and probably kill me.

26:12.804 --> 26:15.637
If she doesn't kill me,
it'll just hurt like hell.

26:16.841 --> 26:20.174
Probably get infected and hurt worse.
I'm not gonna do it.

26:20.211 --> 26:23.908
I get that you're scared, but if you
want to live you need the surgery.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.850
If I want to live? Have you been
paying any attention?

26:33.592 --> 26:36.618
My girlfriend had a hysterical
pregnancy and went nuts,

26:36.661 --> 26:39.858
cut her wrists while I was in the
next room, had to be committed.

26:39.898 --> 26:42.230
Now my roommate's planning
to make me move.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.964
I have no money for a deposit.
Chances are next week I'm homeless.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.742
You're making stuff up
to make me feel better?

26:51.776 --> 26:53.869
You must have something to live for.

26:55.513 --> 26:58.073
Or even just the possibility
of something.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.415
This girl at the grocery store.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.282
I keep meaning to say hello.

27:06.925 --> 27:10.952
Instead I... just keep asking her
about the produce.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.328
All right. So you get the surgery.

27:13.365 --> 27:17.426
'Cause chances are
your luck's gonna turn around.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.961
It's science. It's the law of averages.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.133
It's gonna turn around.

27:23.174 --> 27:26.610
And when it does, you say hello.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.371
I say hello.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.394
Chips?

27:48.633 --> 27:49.725
Chocolate?

27:52.904 --> 27:54.132
Thanks.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.606
- What?
- You're not a terrible person.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.547
- OK.
- I know we don't see eye to eye, but...

28:09.521 --> 28:11.819
I found this really great apartment.

28:12.457 --> 28:16.257
It's right across the street from
the hospital, has great light.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.922
I know you can afford it
and it's Burke-free.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.895
It must be kind of awful
living in his old place.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.702
Think about it.

28:36.648 --> 28:40.709
You can open that retractor up
more if you want to get a better look.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.312
Just make sure you keep
the small bowel inside.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.720
I want to avoid a post-op ileus.

28:45.757 --> 28:49.420
We better. He thinks there's
a dark cloud following him around.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.554
That sounds overly dramatic.

28:51.596 --> 28:55.657
What's that?

28:57.302 --> 28:59.133
- What's...?
- What the hell?

29:03.508 --> 29:06.341
Hey, hey. Hey, move! Move!

29:06.377 --> 29:08.140
- Move the patient!
- What?

29:08.179 --> 29:09.806
Move the patient!

29:11.616 --> 29:14.851
Move the patient!

29:16.521 --> 29:19.115
Oh, my God!

29:22.293 --> 29:24.659
Is everyone OK?
How's our patient?

29:24.696 --> 29:27.563
- Vitals holding stable.
- Irrigation, please.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.659
- How can I help?
- Find Chief, tell him what happened.

29:30.702 --> 29:31.964
God, we need a new OR.

29:32.003 --> 29:35.166
Shut down the other ORs except
for this one and Dr. Sloan's.

29:35.206 --> 29:38.369
Karev, go to Sloan. He just got started,
maybe he can close.

29:38.409 --> 29:41.435
I need everybody's help.
Get ready to move Mr. O'Brien.

29:41.479 --> 29:44.812
- What do I tell Sloan?
- Tell him the damn sky is falling!

29:45.250 --> 29:47.480
Nasal speculum and lidocaine.

29:51.222 --> 29:53.213
Larger speculum, another lidocaine.

29:53.258 --> 29:55.783
- You're just watching?
- I'm a pain specialist

29:55.827 --> 29:59.490
and I would've missed this thing.
So yes, I'm just gonna watch.

30:03.101 --> 30:06.002
Don't ever use me again
to try and influence her.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.096
You and I are not Team Meredith.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.267
We need the OR.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.674
We need the OR!

30:14.279 --> 30:15.974
On a patient?

30:16.014 --> 30:18.847
- Yes, sir.
- Collapsed?

30:20.819 --> 30:24.255
Your staff wasn't hurt,
but the patient's abdomen was open.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.587
He's stable, as far as I know.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.229
Dr. Bailey, spread the word.

30:41.272 --> 30:45.038
We are closing the surgical floor
and shipping patients to Mercy West

30:45.076 --> 30:47.271
- and Seattle Presbyterian.
- Yes, sir.

30:47.312 --> 30:49.075
And Dr. Bailey...

30:51.649 --> 30:55.016
- Try not to gloat on the way out.
- No gloating, sir.

30:58.256 --> 31:01.453
Anybody see any more damage?
Any bleeding?

31:01.492 --> 31:04.086
No bleeding. I cleared
the lower left quadrant.

31:04.128 --> 31:05.686
Give me the pulse irrigator.

31:05.730 --> 31:08.164
Dr. Hahn, take a look at this
right here.

31:08.199 --> 31:11.066
The pancreas.
Is that damage from the debris?

31:11.102 --> 31:13.161
No, no.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.899
That's a tumor.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.735
Oh, son of a bitch.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.304
- You're the shrink, right?
- Yeah.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.179
Well, you can't let her quit.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.908
Let me guess. Cristina.

31:28.953 --> 31:32.616
She talks? Whatever.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.056
Um, you can't let her quit

31:34.092 --> 31:37.584
because I'm no longer allowed
an opinion. I'm being supportive.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.530
So you're my last hope.

31:42.166 --> 31:46.466
It's your job to have an opinion, right?
You're paid to have an opinion?

31:46.504 --> 31:47.698
That's right.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.331
OK. So, um...

31:51.743 --> 31:53.438
She lives her life on an eight.

31:54.846 --> 31:58.077
Her pain. On any given day,
she lives at an eight,

31:58.116 --> 31:59.879
and he doesn't get that.

31:59.918 --> 32:03.251
I mean, he moves in and expects her
to move her roommates out?

32:03.288 --> 32:06.257
Which goes to show you
how completely he doesn't get her

32:06.291 --> 32:09.852
because she needs them. So you need
to tell her not to move them out.

32:09.894 --> 32:14.092
It's not gonna work out in the long run.
She thinks that she's happy, she's not.

32:14.132 --> 32:15.565
It is your job to tell her.

32:20.204 --> 32:22.695
It must be incredibly painful for you,

32:22.740 --> 32:25.834
the idea of losing Meredith to Derek.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.380
You're a terrible shrink.

32:33.751 --> 32:36.618
- Just talk to the oncologist.
- No.

32:36.654 --> 32:39.452
There's a clinical trial
using chemo plus Avastin,

32:39.490 --> 32:41.515
- and there's...
- You're not a doctor.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.823
Please stop talking
like you're a doctor.

32:43.861 --> 32:47.797
Hello?

32:52.637 --> 32:58.269
- Did you have me paged?
- Yes, because I'm dying

32:58.309 --> 33:02.075
and you can't let me die
without knowing what you decided.

33:02.113 --> 33:04.479
No, they found mets
underneath her liver.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.023
You look very serious.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.959
Oh, my God, are you gonna
break up with him?

33:19.998 --> 33:22.193
No fair!

33:22.233 --> 33:25.691
I'm dying and you're casting
all that hotness in the wind.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.303
No fair.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.499
No fair.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.379
No fair.

33:38.282 --> 33:39.681
It's no fair.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.517
It's no fair.

33:46.424 --> 33:48.654
No fair. No fair.

34:01.005 --> 34:02.199
I...

34:03.074 --> 34:05.042
I'm alive.

34:08.012 --> 34:11.311
Dr. Hahn's gonna come in and
talk to you in a couple of minutes.

34:11.349 --> 34:12.714
How'd it go?

34:13.751 --> 34:17.312
- OK?
- Actually, not so OK.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.417
The flood weakened the ceiling
in the OR.

34:20.458 --> 34:24.518
The ceiling collapsed and several
fragments landed inside your incision.

34:25.362 --> 34:28.355
'Cause of the ceiling thing
we had to explore your abdomen

34:28.399 --> 34:30.867
more thoroughly than we normally
would have.

34:30.902 --> 34:34.065
As a result we found
a malignant tumor on your pancreas.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.538
Cancer?

34:36.507 --> 34:39.908
You found cancer?

34:39.944 --> 34:44.710
Whoa, wait. Listen. Listen, man,
'cause here's the thing.

34:44.748 --> 34:48.549
We took it out, sent it to pathology.
It was only stage one.

34:48.585 --> 34:49.746
Only stage one.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.016
We never find
pancreatic tumors so early.

34:52.056 --> 34:55.889
They're almost always a death sentence
by the time they're diagnosed.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.087
But not for you.

34:58.129 --> 35:01.360
We took the tumor, the whole thing.
We took it out.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.765
You won't even need chemo.

35:03.801 --> 35:07.362
That ceiling collapse,
it saved your life.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.868
Your luck has turned, man.

35:09.907 --> 35:11.397
It's turned.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.546
I'm gonna go say hello...

35:19.150 --> 35:20.981
...to that girl.

35:22.353 --> 35:24.184
I'm gonna say hello.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.661
Chief.

35:32.497 --> 35:38.265
Chief? I've downloaded all our patients'
labs and radiology onto DVDs

35:38.302 --> 35:42.534
and attached them to their charts.
Is there anything else I can do to help?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.479
How'd it go?

35:53.851 --> 35:56.012
I know. I'm pathetic.

35:56.053 --> 36:00.285
And George doesn't know I exist,
I missed my surgery.

36:00.324 --> 36:03.953
- Could you tell me how it went?
- We didn't get to do the surgery.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.829
Mr. Patmore's been shipped off
to another hospital.

36:07.865 --> 36:10.698
And he will be out of pain
by this time tomorrow.

36:12.436 --> 36:14.904
Photographic memory, huh?

36:15.740 --> 36:18.436
- Yeah.
- Periodic table. Go.

36:19.510 --> 36:23.503
Hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium,
boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,

36:23.548 --> 36:27.951
fluorine, neon, sodium, magnesium,
aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur...

36:27.985 --> 36:29.714
I can keep going.

36:29.754 --> 36:32.655
- We can burn actual wood?
- That's my favorite part.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.284
- You can't find that anymore.
- It's gorgeous.

36:35.326 --> 36:38.523
- What do you think?
- This is a fantastic apartment.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.190
- We love it.
- I love it.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.597
It was really great of you. Thank you.

36:45.636 --> 36:47.126
You're kidding, right?

36:49.173 --> 36:50.606
You're kidding, right?

36:51.375 --> 36:55.106
Cristina, are you kidding me?
I am getting kicked out of my house.

36:55.146 --> 36:57.478
Think I pulled this
off the board for you?

36:57.515 --> 36:59.881
I was asking you to live there with me.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.220
I'm sorry. I'm... That's hilarious.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.816
- I'm sorry.
- I'm walking to the bar.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.826
You are just...

37:09.860 --> 37:11.487
Give me the flier.

37:12.263 --> 37:16.927
Um... I already put a deposit down. I'm
sorry. You should've been more clear.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.974
Fine. You know what? It's fine.

37:24.008 --> 37:27.034
Keep it, that's totally fine.
Enjoy it. That's fine!

37:27.078 --> 37:28.102
Thank you.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.255
I get that you're a private person,
but I am not.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.852
I process my stuff out loud.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.128
I gave up too much of myself
in my marriage.

37:47.164 --> 37:51.533
I can't give up pieces of myself again.

37:53.237 --> 37:55.671
And Mark is my friend.

38:01.646 --> 38:05.605
I think I just hate him
because he's seen you naked.

38:20.998 --> 38:23.364
What was the point?

38:23.401 --> 38:25.369
All those hours and all that money?

38:25.403 --> 38:28.429
What's the point?
The world is a horrible place.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.235
Young people die of diseases.

38:30.274 --> 38:32.970
It makes absolutely no sense
to try to be happy

38:33.010 --> 38:35.205
in a world that's such a horrible place.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.270
Yes.

38:37.748 --> 38:41.240
- What?
- Yes, horrible things do happen.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.977
Happiness, in the face of all of that,

38:45.022 --> 38:48.458
that's not the goal.
Feeling the horrible,

38:48.492 --> 38:53.520
and knowing that you're not gonna die
from those feelings, that's the point.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.464
And you're not done.
You've made progress

38:58.502 --> 39:01.471
because you're feeling
and you're telling me about it.

39:01.505 --> 39:05.066
Six months ago it would've been
just you and a bottle of tequila.

39:05.109 --> 39:06.940
My door's always open.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.546
<i>Bones break.</i>

39:15.519 --> 39:17.419
<i>Organs burst.</i>

39:17.888 --> 39:19.446
<i>Flesh tears.</i>

39:20.391 --> 39:23.451
Hey. Are you OK?

39:27.531 --> 39:29.624
You know, I'm happy for you.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.227
I am. I'm really happy
for you and Derek,

39:32.269 --> 39:34.499
and that you guys are moving forward.

39:36.974 --> 39:39.772
I don't know how it happened
that I don't have anyone,

39:39.810 --> 39:43.712
but... I don't have anyone.

39:51.155 --> 39:53.123
That's not true, Iz.

39:53.157 --> 39:54.647
That's not true.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.865
Hello.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.667
<i>We can sew the flesh.</i>

40:11.642 --> 40:12.939
<i>Repair the damage.</i>

40:14.779 --> 40:16.269
<i>Ease the pain.</i>

40:16.313 --> 40:19.009
I found your mom's vintage martini set.

40:23.721 --> 40:25.484
They're my family.

40:25.523 --> 40:28.492
You can't just assume
I'm gonna kick my family out,

40:28.526 --> 40:31.620
and you don't get to announce it
to them and ambush me.

40:31.662 --> 40:35.621
And you definitely don't get
to try to get Cristina on your side.

40:35.666 --> 40:39.295
They're my family, they're who I have.
You and them.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.638
OK.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.179
- OK?
- I'd like to talk about it again,

40:53.217 --> 40:57.586
when you're ready.
But for now, OK.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.133
So you still love me?

41:11.168 --> 41:13.534
<i>But when life breaks down...</i>

41:13.904 --> 41:16.930
- Meredith...
- <i>...when we break down...</i>

41:16.974 --> 41:18.202
...yes.

41:18.242 --> 41:21.939
<i>...there's no science,</i>
<i>no hard and fast rules.</i>

41:23.180 --> 41:25.546
<i>We just have to feel our way through.</i>

41:26.450 --> 41:30.887
<i>And, to a surgeon, there's nothing worse</i>
<i>and there's nothing better.</i>

41:30.921 --> 41:33.754
Are you sure about this, sir?
You've had a long day.

41:35.125 --> 41:38.288
It's one thing to stand on a stage
and give a speech.

41:38.329 --> 41:42.231
But if I want our teaching program
to be the best, and I do,

41:42.266 --> 41:44.291
it starts here.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.766
And it starts with me.

41:47.805 --> 41:50.365
I can't do anything about the flood.

41:51.809 --> 41:54.243
But I can give you your shot, O'Malley.

41:54.278 --> 41:55.939
You earned it.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.039
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

42:01.886 --> 42:03.319
OK.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.118
You get three hours.

42:07.091 --> 42:09.321
Go.
