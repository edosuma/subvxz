♪♪

00:07.330 --> 00:11.330
Smile! I want
to show everyone back
at Radistone my bestie!

00:11.330 --> 00:13.540
Or maybe it's cooler
if we don't smile.

00:13.540 --> 00:14.920
How about half

00:14.920 --> 00:16.040
You're only home for a week!

00:16.040 --> 00:17.330
Take the photo, Ellie!

00:19.540 --> 00:21.080
Delete it
and take another one.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.500
-No way that came out good.
-Okay.

00:26.290 --> 00:29.040
Pretty sure
that's my cousin Aidan
practicing lacrosse.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.460
I'd introduce you,

00:30.460 --> 00:32.250
but he's always
practicing lacrosse.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.380
We met.

00:33.380 --> 00:34.500
Actually,
I met the ball first

00:34.500 --> 00:36.080
when it flew
through my window.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.750
Which was only slightly
less annoying than this.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.750
Hold on!

00:40.750 --> 00:43.710
Aidan! My mom
just made lemon bars!

00:43.710 --> 00:44.750
Great!

00:46.500 --> 00:47.750
She didn't,

00:47.750 --> 00:50.380
but that should buy us
a few moments of peace.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.500
Look at you
manipulating people.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.040
You're learning
real life skills
at boarding school.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.170
Tricking my family?

00:56.170 --> 00:57.880
That one I got from you.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
Aww!

00:58.880 --> 01:00.330
Okay, get psyched,

01:00.330 --> 01:02.080
because I have big plans
for your week home.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.250
Me, too.
I've been saving up

01:04.250 --> 01:06.960
the new season
of Dancing With My Dad
to watch together.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.420
And I've also made us
a two-person afghan

01:09.420 --> 01:11.420
with snack pockets!

01:11.420 --> 01:12.790
Snacky blanket
sounds great,

01:12.790 --> 01:14.580
but I was thinking,

01:14.580 --> 01:16.920
what if you and I
ran a camp for the kids
in the neighborhood?

01:16.920 --> 01:19.250
-Working over school break.
-Mm-hmm.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.580
Oh, I think my mom
just made lemon bars.

01:21.580 --> 01:22.580
Oh, come on!

01:22.580 --> 01:23.960
It'll be fun!

01:23.960 --> 01:26.540
Teaching arts and crafts,
getting fresh air.

01:26.540 --> 01:27.710
And...?

01:27.710 --> 01:30.380
And? There is no and.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.880
Harley, you always
have an and.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.120
And I love that
about you.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.920
It's a lot more fun
than my "sorry, but no."

01:37.920 --> 01:39.540
Okay, there is an and.

01:39.540 --> 01:40.920
And it's a big one.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.120
My quinceañera's
this year.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.380
98 more days.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.040
I've been counting down
since kindergarten.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.920
That's what
I love about you.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.620
Now, if it's going to
be the best party ever,

01:48.620 --> 01:50.170
which it will be,

01:50.170 --> 01:51.420
I'm going to need
some funds.

01:51.420 --> 01:53.330
Oh. Aren't
your parents paying?

01:53.330 --> 01:55.540
Yeah, for the basics,
but I've got a huge

01:55.540 --> 01:57.790
my-parents-will-never-
pay-for-or-approve-of surprise

01:57.790 --> 01:59.540
that will blow your mind.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.620
Tell me everything!

02:01.620 --> 02:03.420
Can't. Top secret.

02:03.420 --> 02:05.420
But I can tell you.

02:05.420 --> 02:07.040
It's going to be epic.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.670
Will there be
a chocolate fountain?

02:08.670 --> 02:10.210
Of course.

02:10.210 --> 02:12.620
Rotating dance floor?
You bet!

02:12.620 --> 02:15.420
But the real surprise--
you know what?

02:15.420 --> 02:17.330
I don't want to spoil it
for you, either.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.580
If I can help you
with your quince,
count me in.

02:21.580 --> 02:22.620
The only thing
that matters

02:22.620 --> 02:24.210
is that we're
hanging out together.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.920
Exactly. And it'll be
the best of both worlds.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.540
-I promise.
-Oh!

02:28.540 --> 02:30.250
Can the camp
have a garden?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.920
A garden?

02:31.920 --> 02:33.460
Sure. It wouldn't be

02:33.460 --> 02:35.790
Harley and Ellie's
Good Time Fun Camp without one.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.420
We should call it that.

02:38.620 --> 02:39.790
We already are.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.460
Figured you'd
want a part.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.750
You, me,
watching a couple kids.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.250
Easy money.

02:46.670 --> 02:48.290
We may have
greatly underestimated

02:48.290 --> 02:50.580
how many parents want
a break from their children!

Just line up
in an orderly fashion.

03:48.670 --> 03:51.460
If I don't get one,
I'm calling my mom!

03:51.460 --> 03:52.580
Shirt! Shirt!

03:52.580 --> 03:53.830
Shirt! Shirt!

03:53.830 --> 03:56.120
Shirt! Shirt! Shirt! Shirt!

03:56.120 --> 03:57.250
What are you guys doing?

03:57.250 --> 03:58.710
You two
already have shirts.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.670
We see a mob, we join in.

04:00.670 --> 04:03.540
Usually we start them.
This one just happened.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.210
Shirt! Shirt! Shirt! Shirt!

04:06.210 --> 04:08.580
Shirt! Shirt!
Shirt! Shirt!

04:08.580 --> 04:10.620
Uh, here.
You look like an XL.

04:10.620 --> 04:13.710
That was every shirt
in the house,
even the dirty ones.

04:13.710 --> 04:15.750
Maybe we should've capped this
at a handful of kids.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.330
More kids means more money.

04:17.330 --> 04:18.790
More money, more quince.

04:18.790 --> 04:20.750
I don't think
that's a saying.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.420
Harley,
what is going on here?

04:23.420 --> 04:25.670
This isn't a camp.
This is a school district.

04:25.670 --> 04:28.380
What? No! We got this.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.580
Everything is under control.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.000
We're getting more shirts!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.710
This one's mine!

04:32.710 --> 04:34.920
The shirts are very popular.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.620
I only agreed to this

04:36.620 --> 04:38.330
because you'd be taking
the Littles off my hands.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.250
This is like the Littles
times ten.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.000
We're just
getting organized.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.580
After this, we have nothing
but quiet activities planned.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.960
Gardening, yoga, naptime.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.620
Georgie's
been begging to help.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.420
Okay, hardly any of that
was true.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.620
But to hold onto this quince
cash, I've gotta go hard.

04:55.620 --> 04:59.420
Time to seal the deal
with some old school kiss-up.

04:59.420 --> 05:05.080
Wow, this does not sound
like the great mom
I'm used to.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.790
This sounds like
one of those helicopter moms

05:06.790 --> 05:08.830
who hovers
over their kids 24-7,

05:08.830 --> 05:10.500
squashing their independence.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.670
You know, like Bethany.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.460
Bethany

05:15.460 --> 05:18.670
Ugh! I am
so not a squashy mom.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.670
Fine. Do your camp,

05:20.670 --> 05:22.210
but the first sign
of trouble,

05:22.210 --> 05:23.540
I'm shutting
this whole thing down.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.880
You won't hear a peep,

05:24.880 --> 05:26.420
and if anything happens,

05:26.420 --> 05:27.790
you'll only be
a stone's throw away.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.620
Not that anybody's
throwing stones.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.420
Okay, fine. I'm gonna
go do some laundry.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.420
I can't find a single
clean shirt in this house.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.580
"Number one mom"?

05:36.580 --> 05:37.580
Is that my shirt?

05:37.580 --> 05:39.000
Hate to break it to you,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.620
but there's more than one
number one mom.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.380
Great. Now I have
to change the name

05:45.380 --> 05:47.620
to Harley and Ellie's
Quiet Time Silent Camp.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.170
Doesn't have the same ring
to it,

05:49.170 --> 05:51.250
but money spends the same.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.880
Thanks for agreeing
to help me out so quickly.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.250
No problem. I saw that kid
water-skiing off Ellie

05:56.250 --> 05:57.960
and figured it was
only a matter of time.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.670
Who packs carrot sticks
without a dip?

06:00.670 --> 06:01.960
You're supposed
to be outside at camp.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.710
Are you stealing lunches?

06:03.710 --> 06:04.880
Just the good ones.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.880
Ooh! A brownie!

06:06.880 --> 06:10.380
And no walnuts?
Jackpot!

06:11.880 --> 06:13.710
Change of plans.
You're on Daphne duty.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.710
Otherwise,
this camp is done.

06:15.710 --> 06:19.750
Look at her,
scavenging through lunches
like a two-legged raccoon.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.790
Next thing you know

06:21.790 --> 06:22.880
she'll be turning
over garbage cans
and biting people.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.380
I'm on it.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.500
Daphne, your behavior
is unacceptable,

06:26.500 --> 06:27.750
and it stops now.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.880
Don't attempt the impossible.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.210
We've already had
two parents and a big sister
try to tame her.

06:34.210 --> 06:35.710
A challenge
where I'm the underdog?

06:35.710 --> 06:37.380
That's my groove.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.710
No, no, no! You only need
to contain, not re-train.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.880
Too late. I'm in the zone.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.960
Okay, put the brownie back.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.960
Let me explain
how this is done.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.710
As long
as there's no blood,

06:47.710 --> 06:49.750
and Mom and Dad
don't find out,

06:49.750 --> 06:51.500
I can do what I want.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.750
Rachel let you be
a wild animal,

06:52.750 --> 06:54.750
but Georgie's here
to domesticate.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.710
Brownie goes back.
Give it to me.

06:59.380 --> 07:01.580
Okay. Wrapper and all.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.750
Good thing I'm
up for a challenge.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.750
Ew.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.080
Listen up, kids!

07:07.080 --> 07:10.170
Introducing
the Pedal-Planter.

07:10.170 --> 07:14.170
It tills, it plants,
and it waters.

07:14.170 --> 07:15.750
This thing cuts through
hard ground

07:15.750 --> 07:17.920
like a hot knife
through butter.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.170
Or a butter substitute,

07:19.170 --> 07:21.580
for those who have moms
like mine.

07:21.580 --> 07:23.790
Whew!
She's all yours, Ellie.

07:23.790 --> 07:27.330
Better get back to yoga
before Beast washes his feet
in the cucumber water.

07:27.330 --> 07:30.380
Wait, I thought we were
doing this stuff together.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.460
We will.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.120
Uh, for now, we can shoot
each other meaningful nods
over the yoga screen.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.250
You got it.
Or should I say...

07:43.120 --> 07:44.920
Look, you guys.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.790
At first, I thought that smudge
on your cheek was a freckle.

07:48.790 --> 07:51.960
But freckles don't smell
like barbecue sauce. Ew.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.080
Okay. First activity
in Georgie's Fun Time
Domestication Camp?

07:55.080 --> 07:56.290
A shower.

07:56.290 --> 07:58.120
Shower? No problem.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.330
Wow. That was easy.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.040
Oh, oop!
You forgot your towel!

08:11.040 --> 08:12.500
I thought you were taking
a shower.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.960
This is a shower.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.830
I run the water
for five minutes,

08:15.830 --> 08:18.500
have a light snack, do
a "spot the difference" puzzle,

08:18.500 --> 08:20.620
then enjoy
the rest of my day.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.920
That might have flown
with Rachel,

08:21.920 --> 08:23.380
but not with me.

08:23.380 --> 08:26.790
Human beings bathe.
Get in that shower.

08:26.790 --> 08:27.830
You need...

08:27.830 --> 08:28.880
to take...

08:28.880 --> 08:30.170
a shower!

08:30.170 --> 08:33.790
I got rained on
the other day!

08:33.790 --> 08:36.580
No, no, no, no!

08:38.460 --> 08:40.830
Run, Deathne, run!

08:46.380 --> 08:49.000
Hello? I can't see.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.040
And this shirt
smells like pork chops!

08:51.040 --> 08:53.000
I'm calling my mom!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.880
Nama-stay still.
I'll help you.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.920
Now this next pose,
is downward dog.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.380
If we're gonna do dog stuff,

08:59.380 --> 09:01.380
I'd rather chase
a squirrel.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.380
Harley, can we chase--

09:02.380 --> 09:04.750
No! And no talking!

09:04.750 --> 09:07.000
I'd like to also remind
the two in the middle

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
that there's no marking
your territory

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
during downward dog.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh!

09:11.000 --> 09:12.120
Or any pose.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.460
Good. Good.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.040
Good for you, Harley.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.920
And more importantly,
good for me.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.710
Till that sod!
Work those quads!

09:37.710 --> 09:39.750
Good one, Ellie.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.540
Hey, Harley! Till that--

09:41.540 --> 09:43.920
Shh! Trying to breathe
quietly over here.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.790
Sorry.

09:45.790 --> 09:48.040
Till that sod.
Work those quads.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.880
Breathe in.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.880
Breathe out.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.290
Just so you know,

09:52.290 --> 09:54.960
camp is usually breathing
and something else.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.040
Yeah. Where's
the something else?

09:57.040 --> 09:58.080
The something else
is 20 bucks

09:58.080 --> 09:59.540
if you keep your mouth closed.

10:01.710 --> 10:04.670
Breathe in,
Breathe out, everybody.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.120
Did a bird just fly
into the fence?

10:08.120 --> 10:10.120
Good idea, Hunter.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.710
Let's think about nature.

10:12.710 --> 10:15.330
Birds. Flowers.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.960
Bird attack!

10:17.960 --> 10:19.120
I'm calling my mom!

10:19.120 --> 10:21.000
It's a ball, not a bird.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.460
I'll shoo him away.

10:30.540 --> 10:32.290
Hi! Aidan, right?

10:32.290 --> 10:34.250
I'm Harley. Happy Monday.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.830
I'm running
a camp over here.

10:35.830 --> 10:37.290
You might have noticed
the sign

10:37.290 --> 10:39.040
you just
put a hole through?

10:39.040 --> 10:41.000
-And it's hard for us--
-I'll stop.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.040
Oh.

10:43.040 --> 10:43.920
Thank you!

10:50.330 --> 10:52.170
You said
you were going to stop.

10:52.170 --> 10:54.120
Didn't say when.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.120
Sure, come on over.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.040
Why would you
say you'd stop
then keep going?

11:04.040 --> 11:05.380
Figured
it'd make you go away.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.620
Apparently, not long enough.

11:07.620 --> 11:10.170
Has anyone ever told you
you're extremely rude?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.500
Actually,
I'm just being regular rude.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.830
When I'm extremely rude,
you'll know it.

11:14.830 --> 11:18.330
And if you ask me,
you're the rude one.

11:18.330 --> 11:21.500
Most people greet
the new neighbors
with cookies or a pie.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.330
All you brought was
a big ol' basket of 'tude.

11:24.330 --> 11:25.830
Welcome to the neighborhood.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.170
Enjoy.

11:29.170 --> 11:30.580
Ooh, what do we have here?

11:31.580 --> 11:33.790
Some crabby pants.
Nice.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.040
Some sass. Ooh!

11:36.040 --> 11:38.420
A giant tub of
thinks she knows it all.

11:38.420 --> 11:41.210
Nobody picks up a tub
like that.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.120
Here's a jar
of can't take a joke.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.120
You should hold on
to that one.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.830
I can take a joke!

11:47.170 --> 11:48.620
You know what?

11:48.620 --> 11:50.580
You don't deserve this.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.920
I like my dog bed better!

11:55.920 --> 11:58.750
Nap like an animal,
act like an animal.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.790
It's time you had
a real bed.

12:00.790 --> 12:03.040
I don't know what to do
with my arms and legs.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.120
There's too much room!

12:05.120 --> 12:06.330
That's because
you're used to sleeping

12:06.330 --> 12:08.620
in something that's meant
for a Chihuahua.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.580
Go ahead, stretch out
and explore the space.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.210
Ugh!

12:18.290 --> 12:21.620
Okay, now I'm comfortable.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.420
Can you help me load
this tank?

12:27.420 --> 12:29.040
Harley?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.620
"Giant tub of thinks
she knows it all"?

12:30.620 --> 12:32.170
Where does he get
this stuff?

12:32.170 --> 12:34.250
And I'll do it myself.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.830
Oh!

12:35.830 --> 12:38.210
Shoot! They'll drown!

12:38.210 --> 12:39.330
Mmm!

12:40.960 --> 12:43.790
That's it!
We'll drown him out.

12:43.790 --> 12:45.170
This camp will be
so noisy,

12:45.170 --> 12:47.250
Aidan won't want to be
anywhere near it.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.880
Except any noise
that I throw at him

12:49.880 --> 12:51.580
will hit Mom's ears, too.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.380
Unless...

12:53.380 --> 12:56.040
I know you're always looking
for a quiet place to relax,

12:56.040 --> 12:59.170
and this is better
than under the desk
in the kitchen.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.790
Yes, we know you go there.

13:00.790 --> 13:03.250
And, yes, I brought
your hidden cookies.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.580
That's very sweet,
but I should not be up
in the attic

13:05.580 --> 13:06.750
when you guys are--

13:06.750 --> 13:08.880
They broke up?
-Mm-hmm.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.710
No! How

13:12.710 --> 13:15.080
Are you sure you guys
will be okay?

13:15.080 --> 13:17.210
Whoa, whoa!
Helicopter mom, incoming!

13:17.210 --> 13:20.420
Don't mean to squash.
Sorry.

13:20.420 --> 13:24.120
The attic is a part of the house
that's furthest from the yard.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.040
Other than the chimney,

13:26.040 --> 13:28.210
but no one wants
to eat cookies in a chimney.

13:28.210 --> 13:30.500
Time to make some noise.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.210
Where are you going?

13:32.210 --> 13:34.750
To find Mom.
We're over this.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.170
We were promised
a Good Time Fun Camp.

13:37.170 --> 13:38.500
And yoga is none of that.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.880
Though I do feel
more present.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.460
Hang on!
You guys are right.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.080
This camp is not fun enough.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.750
That's why I'm promoting you
to counselors.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.420
-Yes!
-Finally!

13:50.420 --> 13:52.710
Someone recognizes
our potential.

13:52.710 --> 13:55.290
It takes skill to get
kicked out of every camp
you've attended.

13:55.290 --> 13:56.880
Your first assignment?

13:56.880 --> 13:59.120
Get the kids to make
as much noise as possible.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.710
Hey, that's how
we got kicked out
of our first three camps.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.330
Everything happens
for a reason.
Let's go!

14:04.330 --> 14:05.710
Go, go, go!

14:05.710 --> 14:08.250
All right,
change of plans, gang!

14:08.250 --> 14:11.120
Sure, plants need soil
and water to grow,

14:11.120 --> 14:13.040
but you know what
really helps a garden?

14:13.040 --> 14:14.420
Clapping and yelling.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.580
I've never heard that.

14:15.580 --> 14:16.670
There are studies.

14:16.670 --> 14:18.170
Come on, kids!

14:18.170 --> 14:19.830
Let's get those plants
excited!

14:27.170 --> 14:29.040
Good one! Next!

14:30.380 --> 14:32.250
Show me something, Kowalski!

14:33.380 --> 14:34.830
Just one thing's missing.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.750
Mmm.

14:46.830 --> 14:49.040
Hey, what's your deal?

14:55.250 --> 14:57.580
Yes! We just out-noised him!

14:57.580 --> 14:59.960
I thought we were
supposed to be gardening!

14:59.960 --> 15:01.420
Tomorrow we garden.

15:01.420 --> 15:03.420
Today we gloat.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.790
Being measured on the wall
is a big Diaz tradition.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.620
So's being noisy.
Let's do that.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.380
Whoa! Hang on!

15:11.380 --> 15:13.250
You feel like a lone wolf

15:13.250 --> 15:14.670
because you're
a forgotten member of the pack.

15:14.670 --> 15:16.040
The last time you were measured,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.710
you were barely taller
than the baseboard.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.500
Oh, that's Deathne.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.120
I made that mark
when she learned
how to stand.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.210
Hmm.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.790
-Ow!
-It's tangled! Hold on!

15:32.790 --> 15:34.750
Oh, no! It's ruined!

15:34.750 --> 15:36.250
How am I going
to tell Mom?

15:36.250 --> 15:37.790
We're not.

15:37.790 --> 15:39.210
She's going to notice,
and I can't lie.

15:39.210 --> 15:41.460
Sad. You were
the second kid.

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
All that attention
softened you.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.290
You're like a baby bird
that needs its food

15:45.290 --> 15:47.210
spit into its mouth.

15:47.210 --> 15:50.380
A lone wolf needs to teach
a baby bird how to survive.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.460
A little paint,
no punishment.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.250
Hmm. Oh, no! A drip.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.170
Oh, no!
I'm making it worse!

16:01.170 --> 16:05.250
Lesson number two in Daphne's
Fun Time Wild Animal Camp,

16:05.250 --> 16:06.540
Camouflage.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.330
I don't know if Mom's

16:09.330 --> 16:10.420
going to believe
this is feng shui,

16:10.420 --> 16:13.710
but it does cover up
our mistake.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.040
My sofa!

16:18.500 --> 16:19.500
Don't be a Bethany.

16:21.170 --> 16:22.540
It's really nice
over here.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.330
Day one of camp was bumpy,

16:24.330 --> 16:25.880
but we learned some stuff.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.710
Like attic plus hammock
plus tragic celebrity breakup

16:28.710 --> 16:30.460
equals Mom out of my hair.

16:30.460 --> 16:31.460
Breakfast in hammock.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.330
As a thank you
for trusting me yesterday.

16:35.330 --> 16:38.380
Not sure you
should trust me with
a hot beverage in a swing.

16:38.380 --> 16:41.250
I do because I'm
not a helicopter daughter.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.670
You raised me that way.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.830
And look at what else
I've got for you.

16:44.830 --> 16:47.920
Season four
of Heatherton Cottage
all cued up and ready to go.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.040
Enjoy.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.330
This is Sleepy Dreams tea.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.460
Then it's a good thing
you're already in that hammock.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.500
All right, sleep well.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.080
I mean... bye.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.380
Whew!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.170
Mornin', neighbor!

17:06.170 --> 17:09.540
The fence!
You moved our fence!

17:09.540 --> 17:11.120
You like?

17:11.120 --> 17:12.420
It's amazing what you can do
with a lacrosse team

17:12.420 --> 17:14.540
and some motivational pizza.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.380
Camp's supposed to start
in a minute.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.120
You took my yard!

17:21.120 --> 17:23.250
Well, actually, it's
my Aunt Bethany's yard.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.420
After all the noise,
I went down to City Hall

17:25.420 --> 17:27.330
to see if backyard camps
were even allowed.

17:27.330 --> 17:29.420
Turns out they are.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.710
Also turns out
there was a little mistake.

17:31.710 --> 17:34.420
Your fence
was on our property.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.040
Not anymore.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.250
You're welcome.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.380
What?

17:41.380 --> 17:42.380
Yard!

17:42.380 --> 17:43.380
Mom!

17:43.380 --> 17:45.420
Quince!

17:45.420 --> 17:48.040
Bad.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.250
I can't believe
our rearrange worked.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.580
Who knows, maybe
it is good feng shui.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.620
No! No, it's not!

17:55.620 --> 17:57.250
Uh, uh-- glue!
We need glue!

17:57.250 --> 17:59.460
Lewie and Beast
used all of it two days ago

17:59.460 --> 18:00.380
for a glue bath.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.620
At least they take one.

18:01.620 --> 18:02.830
Now what?

18:02.830 --> 18:05.540
Relax. Gum works, too.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.880
I used just a few pieces
to fix the...

18:07.880 --> 18:11.790
Oh, we're also
out of gum.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.040
Yesterday a kid with
a turkey sandwich had gum.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.580
I remember thinking
it was a weird dessert

18:17.580 --> 18:19.540
while I was eating
his turkey sandwich.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.460
-I brought you something.
-Great! Later.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.000
Right now, we're gonna
make your cousin's life

18:30.000 --> 18:32.120
so miserable
he'll move the fence.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.500
Oh, I'll just tell Mom
to make him do it
when she gets home.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.210
She's always been fine
with the property line
where it was.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.540
No! Your mom knowing
means my mom knowing

18:38.540 --> 18:39.670
which means bye-bye camp.

18:39.670 --> 18:41.580
We have to be smart
about this.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.710
Now grab an eggplant,
get outside, and join the army.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.460
Army?

18:51.460 --> 18:53.210
Let's not limit ourselves
just to gum.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.460
If you find anything
chocolate, take it.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.330
We've earned it.

18:57.620 --> 19:01.210
Whoa!
A birthday cupcake!

19:01.210 --> 19:03.710
My present to Toby
is some advice.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.460
Never leave a cupcake
unattended.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.210
I can't do this.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.750
I was supposed
to domesticate you,

19:09.750 --> 19:11.670
not become the biggest liar
in the animal kingdom.

19:11.670 --> 19:14.750
Some days you eat,
and some days you get eaten.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.290
When Mom sees that wall,

19:16.290 --> 19:17.580
she'll definitely
be having us for dinner.

19:17.580 --> 19:18.380
Now put that back.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.460
No.

19:23.460 --> 19:26.330
You are such a baby bird.

19:45.710 --> 19:49.620
This is the moment we've all
been training for, gentlemen.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.420
Not all of you
will return clean,

19:51.420 --> 19:54.670
but know that
you will have gotten dirty

19:54.670 --> 19:56.710
defending justice.

19:56.710 --> 20:00.120
I am very proud
of each and every one of you.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.250
Commander Beast,
has the Peddle-Planter

20:05.250 --> 20:07.250
been fully converted
for water assault?

20:07.250 --> 20:09.500
On its mark, General.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.750
We attack on my signal.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.750
Eggplant at the ready,
Ellie.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.670
Wait. Where's Ellie?

20:16.750 --> 20:18.380
Hang on.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.750
What? You can't give an army
a battle speech

20:20.750 --> 20:23.170
then tell them to wait!

20:23.170 --> 20:24.540
All right. Fine.

20:24.540 --> 20:25.830
We've got a minute.

20:25.830 --> 20:28.120
Who's got to go potty?

20:29.670 --> 20:31.330
You've got vegetables
to throw.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.120
I'd rather watch
Dancing With My Dad,

20:33.120 --> 20:34.670
if I could hear it
over all the noise

20:34.670 --> 20:36.540
of your
backyard veggie fight.

20:36.540 --> 20:38.540
I thought we were supposed
to watch that together.

20:38.540 --> 20:42.380
Me, too, but then you went
from counselor to colonel.

20:42.380 --> 20:45.460
I gave up my vacation
to help you raise money
for your quince,

20:45.460 --> 20:47.120
because I'm Team Harley,

20:47.120 --> 20:50.040
but this is not the team
I signed up for!

20:51.710 --> 20:52.880
Ohh!

20:57.960 --> 20:59.250
Ellie, wait!

20:59.250 --> 21:01.250
I've been waiting
for two days.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.710
You know, I don't know
what's lamer,

21:03.710 --> 21:05.540
that I made
a two-person snack blanket

21:05.540 --> 21:08.080
or that I have
to storm out in one!

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
She's right.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.670
That was awkward.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.710
But not as awkward
as realizing

21:14.710 --> 21:16.670
you've wasted
your whole vacation

21:16.670 --> 21:18.670
fighting with an enemy instead
of hanging with a friend.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.580
It's time to call a truce
with Aidan.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.080
Guys!

21:40.080 --> 21:41.750
That's the attack signal!

21:41.750 --> 21:44.500
Charge!

21:48.170 --> 21:49.960
What are you doing?
No! No! It's over!
It's done!

21:49.960 --> 21:53.790
Push that fence back
to where it goes!

21:53.790 --> 21:54.750
No! Stop! Stop!

21:54.750 --> 21:55.830
Come on!
Don't let us down!

21:57.250 --> 21:58.580
Nooo!

22:00.170 --> 22:02.210
[children yelling
over piano music]

22:14.790 --> 22:18.080
Uh, all right!
Camp's over!

22:19.670 --> 22:21.750
I figured out the rest
of your vacation.

22:21.750 --> 22:24.420
Clean up, then lock down.

22:26.580 --> 22:28.880
Georgie and I
accidentally got paint
on the wall

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
and broke a lamp.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.210
Don't bother me right now.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.790
Your sister just destroyed
our backyard.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.000
Last lesson of the wild.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.790
The best time to confess
to Mama Bear

22:41.790 --> 22:44.460
is right after another cub
does something worse.

22:45.790 --> 22:46.580
Ahh.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.460
This is a mess.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.880
Yeah, I know.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.000
I've done a good job
blowing things up this week.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.830
Fences, friendships.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.250
I'm really sorry.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.830
I feel like
the biggest jerk ever.

23:05.830 --> 23:08.080
I don't know.
A certain lacrosse player

23:08.080 --> 23:10.040
may have you beat
in that department.

23:11.710 --> 23:13.830
Sorry you didn't get
to earn your quince money

23:13.830 --> 23:17.120
for the secret thing
you had planned.

23:17.120 --> 23:20.670
But if I know you,
whatever it is,

23:20.670 --> 23:22.460
it'll be great.

23:22.460 --> 23:25.040
And if I know you,
you can keep a secret.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.080
-Yes!

23:28.750 --> 23:31.670
Okay, so the camp
was a bust.

23:31.670 --> 23:34.710
But I did manage
to mend one fence.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.170
And I realized some people
you can't change

23:36.170 --> 23:38.080
no matter what you do.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.750
♪ I'm rakin' the leaves
back to your garden ♪

23:42.750 --> 23:44.880
And others just need

mm, count on me ♪

23:48.830 --> 23:50.460

23:57.830 --> 24:00.750

24:00.750 --> 24:03.330
