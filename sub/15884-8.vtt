00:36.322 --> 00:39.195
I'm just trying

00:39.229 --> 00:41.998
Don't whisper.
Don't whisper.

00:42.033 --> 00:45.871
Just speak like a normal
individual, all right?

00:45.905 --> 00:49.480
Act natural,

00:49.514 --> 00:51.016

01:03.196 --> 01:04.930
What's going on here?

01:04.964 --> 01:06.431
Why are you playing

01:06.465 --> 01:07.799
I'm just trying to act--
I'm just trying to act--

01:07.834 --> 01:10.135
- I'm trying to act natural.
- Well, why you jumping

01:10.170 --> 01:11.938
in between different characters
to do so?

01:11.972 --> 01:13.172
I'm not.
I'm not doing that.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.641
- What am I--
- Trying to act natural.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.976
If anything,
I'm changing my volume.

01:16.011 --> 01:17.679
You acting like someone
who's trying to hide it.

01:17.713 --> 01:18.980
You know who tries to hide it?

01:19.014 --> 01:20.448
- Dudes who's buying drugs...
- (shushing)

01:20.482 --> 01:22.116
- Try to hide it, all right?
- Okay.

01:22.151 --> 01:23.217
You looking like the most
drug-buyingest dude in--

01:23.252 --> 01:27.354
Okay, please stop saying
the word "drugs."

01:27.388 --> 01:28.989
- Damn!
- (shushes)

01:29.023 --> 01:31.524
Don't shush me.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.028
Now just take out your money.

01:34.062 --> 01:37.331
And fan it.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.433
- Fan it?
- Fan it.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.601
You know how to fan money?

01:40.635 --> 01:42.471
- Just-- somebody might see.
- Thank you.

01:42.505 --> 01:44.673
No.
Fan it out.

01:44.707 --> 01:46.307
Good.

01:46.342 --> 01:51.078
Now give it to me.
Good.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.413
That's all there is to it.

01:52.447 --> 01:54.815
Here come the drug machine.
Boop.

01:54.850 --> 01:57.585
All right, now just high five
And say "drugs."

01:57.619 --> 02:01.088
(both) Drugs.

02:01.123 --> 02:03.224
Unreal.
Look at these clowns.

02:03.258 --> 02:05.292
- Those two?
- Not them.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.026
- Them.
- Go, go, go. Drug deal!

02:08.062 --> 02:11.631
(both grunting)
(women exclaiming)

02:11.666 --> 02:14.302
You're under arrest!

02:14.336 --> 02:15.770
Hands where I can see 'em,

02:46.132 --> 02:48.099

02:53.506 --> 02:58.042
Have you ever been in a bathroom
of a baseball stadium?

02:58.077 --> 02:59.811
- And there's this dude?
- This dude--talking about--

02:59.845 --> 03:01.346
- We talked about this.
- There's this dude.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.916
- Right, this guy.
- Right, this guy.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.357
All right, fellas, tap it
any more than two times

03:11.392 --> 03:13.860
and you're playing with it.
(laughs)

03:13.894 --> 03:16.430
Now he's pretending
like it's his joke.

03:16.464 --> 03:19.499
This joke has been around
since 1867.

03:19.534 --> 03:21.301
Right.
Can you imagine--

03:21.335 --> 03:22.803
If they did that
in cowboy times?

03:22.837 --> 03:24.671
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- If a guy did that in--

03:24.705 --> 03:26.606
That wouldn't fly
the same way.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.607
- No, it'd be like--
- It'd be like--

03:27.641 --> 03:30.044
(both making metal noises)

03:30.078 --> 03:33.079
(laughter)

03:37.818 --> 03:41.721
(exaggerated drawl)
Well, fellas,

03:41.755 --> 03:44.023
you tap it any more
than two times

03:44.058 --> 03:48.395
and you are officially
playing with yourself.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.671
That's my joke.
(imitates gunfire)

03:57.705 --> 03:59.405
(laughter)

04:00.741 --> 04:02.573
The right triangle's
longest side

04:02.608 --> 04:04.041
is called the hypotenuse,

04:04.075 --> 04:05.942
and it's this side here.

04:05.977 --> 04:11.246
Hey, I wish I were high
on potenuse.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.947
(giggles)

04:12.981 --> 04:14.981
"I wish I was high
on potenuse."

04:15.016 --> 04:18.516
(laughter)

04:26.989 --> 04:28.990
Okay, okay, okay.

04:29.024 --> 04:30.791
Oh, Mr. Morrison,
it's very funny.

04:30.826 --> 04:33.159
It's very funny, but let's
get back to the lesson.

04:33.193 --> 04:36.895
We can see the longest one

04:36.929 --> 04:37.995
where it goes
from this point--

04:38.030 --> 04:39.229
That was my joke.

04:39.264 --> 04:41.364
I know, man.
That was hilarious.

04:41.398 --> 04:43.365
...triangle.
I've labeled them here

04:43.400 --> 04:45.633
- "A," "B," and "C."
- No, but, I mean, I said that.

04:45.667 --> 04:47.134
I said it.

04:47.168 --> 04:49.335
I said it.
I said that.

04:49.369 --> 04:52.871
Please, please, Mr. Jackson,
keep your comments to yourself.

04:52.905 --> 04:55.673
Thank you.

04:55.707 --> 04:59.742
Now the hypotenuse--
(laughter)

05:04.781 --> 05:07.015
Mr. Morrison,
You really got me on that one.

05:07.049 --> 05:08.949
Oh, so great.

05:08.984 --> 05:10.684
Oh, oh, Principal Martel,
Principal Martel, come here,

05:10.718 --> 05:12.586
Come here,
come here.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.220
Tell Principal Martel
what you said, Troy.

05:14.254 --> 05:17.555
Oh, she was talking
about the hypotenuse,

05:17.590 --> 05:21.057
and I said, "I wish
I was high on potenuse."

05:21.150 --> 05:24.751
(laughter)

05:24.786 --> 05:26.453
I'm sorry.

05:26.487 --> 05:29.655
(laughter continues)
He likes it.

05:29.689 --> 05:32.590
Principal Martel's cool.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.829
Oh, that's--
That's very funny.

05:35.901 --> 05:38.436
Principal Martel,
Principal Martel, I said that.

05:38.470 --> 05:41.272
Mr. Jackson,
that is enough.

05:41.306 --> 05:43.340
- But I said it first.
- Dude, come on.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.576
Mr. Iglesias,
Mr. Iglesias,

05:45.611 --> 05:46.711
Yes, come in,
Come in.

05:46.746 --> 05:47.779

- Yeah.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.148
Yes.
What's up, peoples?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.249
- Fluffy.
- Comedian Gabriel Iglesias

05:51.284 --> 05:53.451
is touring
the local schools today

05:53.485 --> 05:54.918
for a charity
he's working on.

05:54.953 --> 05:56.453
Tell him what you said.
Tell him what you said.

05:56.487 --> 06:00.255
Uh, I wish I was high
on potenuse.

06:00.289 --> 06:03.391
(laughter)

06:03.426 --> 06:05.260
Oh, my God.
That is clever.

06:05.294 --> 06:06.762
That is clever.
Very funny.

06:06.796 --> 06:08.730
- No. No.
- Very funny.

06:08.765 --> 06:10.265
Right?
Thanks, thanks.

06:10.299 --> 06:12.000
Mr. Iglesias,
Mr. Iglesias,

06:12.034 --> 06:13.401
I'm your biggest fan.

06:13.435 --> 06:14.735
That was my joke.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.303
You know,
it's not really cool, buddy,

06:16.338 --> 06:17.972
to take credit
for other people's jokes.

06:18.006 --> 06:20.140
Hey, listen,
funny stuff.

06:20.175 --> 06:21.742
I'm doing this big tour
right now.

06:21.776 --> 06:23.844
You want to see about maybe we
could talk about you opening?

06:23.878 --> 06:26.146
I need an opener.

06:26.181 --> 06:27.514
Um, sure.

06:27.549 --> 06:28.882
What do you think?
Is that okay?

06:28.917 --> 06:30.417
- Of course. Of course.
- Yeah.

06:30.452 --> 06:32.687
(gasps)
What?

06:34.824 --> 06:36.424
- Sorry about that.
- Talent, man.

06:36.458 --> 06:37.826
It's nice to meet you.
Thanks so much.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.094
That's like a Richard Pryor.
Get over here, man.

06:39.128 --> 06:42.030
- Come on.
- Richard Pryor.

06:42.064 --> 06:43.364
He deserved it.

06:43.398 --> 06:46.367
All right, so across
from the longest side

06:46.401 --> 06:47.902
is a 90-degree angle.

06:47.936 --> 06:52.073
Good thing I've got
a 90-degree dangle.

06:52.107 --> 06:55.477
Joel, stop it!
You will never be Troy!

06:55.511 --> 06:57.813
Why are you trying
to be like Troy?

06:57.847 --> 06:59.280
Dick.

06:59.315 --> 07:01.849
<i>Et tu</i>, nerdy girl?

07:01.883 --> 07:03.917
(snickers)

07:03.951 --> 07:06.920
So the hypotenu--
(laughter)

07:09.557 --> 07:12.459
What the [bleep]
is going on?

07:12.493 --> 07:14.661
I'm gonna piss my pants.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.730
I'm gonna piss my pants
right here.

07:17.765 --> 07:19.432
Oh, my God!
Oh!

07:22.255 --> 07:24.957
You ever go see black theater?
Anyone?

07:24.991 --> 07:26.158
Anybody go
to the black theater?

07:26.192 --> 07:27.493
Yeah.
Black theater's interesting

07:27.527 --> 07:32.031
because there's a very distinct
black theater style.

07:32.065 --> 07:33.365
(laughter)

07:33.400 --> 07:34.533
There's a lot
of neck acting.

07:34.568 --> 07:37.203
A lot of neck acting.

07:37.238 --> 07:38.672
You should be
a little overwrought

07:38.706 --> 07:40.340
Whenever ta-- even when you're
happy, you know.

07:40.374 --> 07:43.877
Our family will never, ever...

07:43.911 --> 07:45.712
(laughter)

07:45.746 --> 07:47.948
- ever fall apart.
- Mm.

07:47.982 --> 07:50.017
Seems like something
one should be happy about.

07:50.051 --> 07:54.221
I woke up today,
and I ate some cereal.

07:54.255 --> 07:56.089
(laughter)

08:04.999 --> 08:07.467
- Intermission!
- (hums)

08:07.502 --> 08:11.739
(both) Oh, <i>Othello</i>
is my shite!

08:11.773 --> 08:14.876
- [bleep]-eth, yeah.
- <i>Othello</i>, mother[bleep]!

08:14.910 --> 08:18.179
(both imitating
swordplay sounds)

08:18.213 --> 08:20.748
[bleep],
you dead, white person.

08:20.783 --> 08:23.051
(laughter)
Oh, this play doth seem dope

08:23.085 --> 08:25.153
- to me, Martinsia.
- Verily, Lashawnia.

08:25.187 --> 08:26.854
Verily.
Yo, and 'tis about time

08:26.889 --> 08:29.857
Shakespeare doth scriven
the play that places a brother

08:29.891 --> 08:31.892
- amongst the firmaments.
- That's my shite!

08:31.927 --> 08:33.760
Oh, who's your favorite
character?

08:33.794 --> 08:35.062
- Mine's Othello.
- Oh, 'tis mine as well.

08:35.096 --> 08:37.231
- 'tis mine as well.
- Because they got Othello

08:37.265 --> 08:40.267
as a general.
I'm saying, helleth, yes.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.869
And Othello did the beast
with two backs

08:41.904 --> 08:43.604
with that comely white maiden,

08:43.638 --> 08:46.040
and didst not anyone
speaketh against him.

08:46.074 --> 08:47.841
- Mm.
- He straight pimpin'.

08:47.876 --> 08:51.444
Methinks things are looking up
for people of the darker hue.

08:51.478 --> 08:53.146
- Damn straight.
- Hoo.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.881
(Both) â™ª Hey, nonny, nonny,
talking hey, nonny, nonny â™ª

08:55.916 --> 08:58.551
- Come on.
- Oh, hey, Martinsia.

08:58.585 --> 09:00.052
- Mm.
- Wouldst that I could borrow

09:00.087 --> 09:01.954
a couple of ducats
to purchaseth a capon

09:01.989 --> 09:03.223
from yonder concession?

09:03.257 --> 09:05.192
Pssh, Moor, please.

09:05.226 --> 09:06.960
You know I got
a concealed cornish game hen

09:06.994 --> 09:09.095
- up in my doublet.
- Ooh, alloweth me to partaketh

09:09.130 --> 09:10.764
- up in this bitch.
- Okay, okay.

09:10.798 --> 09:13.133
Get in there.
(bell dings)

09:13.167 --> 09:15.135
The second act
is about to begin.

09:15.169 --> 09:17.570
Come on, y'all.
Y'all heard the ursher.

09:17.605 --> 09:19.872
If I know Shakespeare,
Othello's about to kill

09:19.907 --> 09:22.308
everybody up in this bitch.
(laughs)

09:28.149 --> 09:32.219
No, no, no,
Mm-mm, I hateth this play.

09:32.253 --> 09:34.121
How they gonna kill Othello?

09:34.155 --> 09:36.423
Man, that trifling ass Iago,
I knew he was up to something.

09:36.457 --> 09:37.758
They should have killed him
in the first act.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.726
How they gonna kill Othello?

09:39.760 --> 09:41.961
How Othello gonna do himself
in with a dagger,

09:41.996 --> 09:43.963
- how doth that happen?
- Let me tell you something,

09:43.998 --> 09:46.165
if a brother kill himself
every time he broke up

09:46.200 --> 09:48.568
with a white bitch, this world
would be bereft of brothers.

09:48.602 --> 09:49.935
You'd be talking
to a skull right now.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.438
- Okay?
- Where's Shakespeares at?

09:52.473 --> 09:54.240
- Shakespeares.
- Oh, he's right there.

09:54.275 --> 09:56.209
(both) Prithee.
Prithee.

09:56.243 --> 09:57.277
Make way.
Prithee. Make way.

09:57.311 --> 09:59.612
Be gone, Sire.

09:59.646 --> 10:01.981
- You killed Othello!
- A black man got it going on,

10:02.015 --> 10:03.349
and you shuffle off
his mortal coil?

10:03.384 --> 10:05.452
I say unto thee
that's a tragedy.

10:05.486 --> 10:06.887
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, 'tis that not

10:06.921 --> 10:08.788
the troubadour Kanye
of the West?

10:08.823 --> 10:11.391
What? Where's--
Wait.

10:11.426 --> 10:12.759
Truth be told, my lords,

10:12.794 --> 10:15.428
'tis not I who penned
this dreadful play.

10:15.463 --> 10:18.097
- 'twas Christopher Marlowe.
- (both) Nay, nay, nay.

10:18.132 --> 10:20.666
- Yes, it was.
- Thou already tried to use

10:20.701 --> 10:22.369
that line of argument
when the Jews wanted

10:22.403 --> 10:24.004
to kick your ass
after <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>.

10:24.038 --> 10:25.538
We doth not purchase it,
Slick Willy.

10:25.573 --> 10:27.173
We doth not purchase it.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.209
Be calm, my good lords.

10:29.243 --> 10:31.678
'twill not be long
before another black hero

10:31.712 --> 10:34.380
graceth the stage, and now
if you'll let me take my leave.

10:34.415 --> 10:36.549
Not so fast.

10:36.583 --> 10:41.821
You going to write
that hero now.

10:41.855 --> 10:47.360
Verily that, mother[bleep].

10:50.064 --> 10:55.303
(both exclaiming
and imitating funk music)

10:55.337 --> 10:57.805
That John Shafte
is one bad mother--

10:57.839 --> 10:58.873
Shut that mouth.

10:58.907 --> 11:00.407
- I just speaketh about <i>Shafte</i>.
- Mm.

11:04.079 --> 11:06.880
Yo, Levi, man.

11:06.915 --> 11:09.249
Just won $10
on this scratch-off, homie.

11:09.283 --> 11:14.187
Pssh, man,
quit pulling my dick.

11:14.222 --> 11:17.357
- What?
- Come up in here lying to me.

11:17.391 --> 11:19.759
I ain't buying it.
You pulling my dick.

11:19.794 --> 11:22.228
First of all,
I ain't lying to you,

11:22.263 --> 11:25.198
And, second of all,
that's not the phrase.

11:25.232 --> 11:27.600
Come up in here, piss on my
dick, tell me it's raining.

11:27.634 --> 11:31.003
Piss on my leg,
and tell me it's raining.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.339
Oh, I see, now you gonna piss
and pull on my dick?

11:33.374 --> 11:35.107
Come on.

11:35.142 --> 11:37.776
Do you understand that you got
all your [bleep] wrong?

11:37.811 --> 11:40.512
No, actually,
you got it wrong.

11:40.547 --> 11:42.615
Yeah.

11:42.649 --> 11:44.550
- I--
- Yeah, see?

11:44.584 --> 11:48.954
You ain't even got a dick
to stand on.

11:50.189 --> 11:52.925
Okay.
Okay, let me ask you a question.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.695
What do you call those little
plastic building blocks?

11:55.729 --> 12:00.300
What you mean,
Dickos?

12:00.334 --> 12:02.268
Name a famous comic strip
detective.

12:02.303 --> 12:06.238
Leg Tracy.
What's with the questions, man?

12:06.273 --> 12:09.409
Do you know the name
of a giant cartoon rooster?

12:09.443 --> 12:12.311
Foghorn Dickhorn.

12:12.345 --> 12:13.579
Okay, you done.
You done.

12:13.613 --> 12:16.448
Give me that.

12:16.482 --> 12:18.784
All right.
Yo, you just gotta--

12:18.818 --> 12:19.951
You gotta leave now, huh?

12:19.986 --> 12:22.087
Just 'cause I got
a dick up on you?

12:26.960 --> 12:31.196
I'm a-leg-ted to marijuana.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.168
You guys know this rule
in football,

12:37.202 --> 12:38.503
excessive celebration, right?

12:38.537 --> 12:41.106
That a player can get
a penalty flag

12:41.141 --> 12:43.843
for celebrating excessively
in the end zone.

12:43.877 --> 12:45.211
What I don't understand is,

12:45.245 --> 12:46.979
they're so disciplined
to learn the skill

12:47.013 --> 12:48.981
of playing football,
you'd think they'd have

12:49.015 --> 12:51.283
enough discipline to get in the
end zone and just be like...

12:51.318 --> 12:52.985
(straining)

12:53.019 --> 12:54.854
(laughter)

12:54.888 --> 12:58.624
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

12:58.658 --> 13:01.193
If anything,
doing the Funky Chicken

13:01.228 --> 13:04.664
after you get a touchdown
exemplifies the fact

13:04.698 --> 13:07.199
that you didn't expect you
were going to get a touchdown.

13:07.233 --> 13:10.302
It would be so much cooler
if you just ran--

13:10.336 --> 13:12.003
You should just score
a touchdown, be like,

13:12.038 --> 13:13.972
"Boop,
this is what I do every day,

13:14.007 --> 13:16.509
"[bleep] it."

13:16.544 --> 13:21.013
(applause)

13:21.048 --> 13:23.081
<i>And we're coming to the end
of the first quarter</i>

13:23.116 --> 13:25.083
<i>with the Rhinos in the red zone
for the first time.</i>

13:25.117 --> 13:27.184
<i>Gotta say, Bill, I like
watching these Rhinos.</i>

13:27.218 --> 13:30.153
<i>Ransom takes the snap,
drops back with good protection,</i>

13:30.187 --> 13:32.722
<i>and that's a completed pass
to a very wide-open</i>

13:32.757 --> 13:35.392
<i>Hingle McCringleberry,
the rookie out of Penn State.</i>

13:35.426 --> 13:38.028
<i>Nice grab by McCringleberry.
You think he's happy?</i>

13:38.062 --> 13:39.429
<i>Oh, boy, he is loving it
down there.</i>

13:39.463 --> 13:43.233
<i>Oh, we got something
of a shooting gallery going on.</i>

13:43.268 --> 13:45.770
<i>Yeah, look at that.
Boy, that is something, and--</i>

13:45.804 --> 13:47.738
<i>Oh, wait, we've got
a flag there.</i>

13:47.773 --> 13:49.674
<i>Is that
for excessive celebration?</i>

13:49.708 --> 13:51.075
<i>Oh, see, I'm not sure
about that call.</i>

13:51.109 --> 13:53.044
<i>I don't know, Bill.
That was three pumps,</i>

13:53.078 --> 13:55.047
<i>and the rulebook says
you cannot have more than two.</i>

13:55.081 --> 13:56.215
<i>Oh, my gosh,
but look at the kid.</i>

13:56.249 --> 13:57.582
<i>He's pleading his case
with the ref.</i>

13:57.617 --> 13:58.950
<i>Pleading his case.</i>

13:58.985 --> 14:00.051
<i>Yeah, clearly three pumps.</i>

14:00.086 --> 14:01.386
<i>Coach Hohnson
definitely not happy</i>

14:01.420 --> 14:02.521
<i>- about this call.
- Two pumps!</i>

14:02.555 --> 14:04.489
<i>Five minutes
into the fourth quarter,</i>

14:04.524 --> 14:07.092
<i>Third and ten, the Rhinos again
threatening to score.</i>

14:07.127 --> 14:08.494
<i>Can the Cougars hold them?</i>

14:08.528 --> 14:10.229
<i>Big play coming here, Bill.</i>

14:10.264 --> 14:12.132
<i>Ransom takes the snap,
drops back,</i>

14:12.166 --> 14:14.234
<i>He floats one
into the end zone,</i>

14:14.269 --> 14:16.203
<i>and McCringleberry
pulls it down.</i>

14:16.238 --> 14:17.605
<i>- He's got it.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

14:17.639 --> 14:19.974
<i>For his second touchdown
of the day for this rookie,</i>

14:20.008 --> 14:21.809
<i>he has gotta be feeling great
about himself.</i>

14:21.844 --> 14:24.112
<i>Nicely done.
I'll tell you, man, he's--</i>

14:24.146 --> 14:26.214
<i>Oh, oh, see,
now there's two pumps.</i>

14:26.248 --> 14:27.815
<i>Yeah, he's really testing
the boundaries,</i>

14:27.849 --> 14:30.584
<i>and he's clearly
gotten the ref's attention here.</i>

14:30.618 --> 14:32.619
<i>A third pump will draw a flag
no matter what.</i>

14:32.653 --> 14:34.654
- (blows whistle)<i>
- See-- oh, he just did it again.</i>

14:34.688 --> 14:36.489
<i>Now what is that,
the second time?</i>

14:36.523 --> 14:37.724
<i>Now you have
to flag him on this.</i>

14:37.758 --> 14:39.292
<i>Yeah, he had to.
You know, Bill,</i>

14:39.326 --> 14:40.793
<i>It's just frustrating
seeing young players</i>

14:40.827 --> 14:42.295
<i>without the ability
to restrain themselves.</i>

14:42.329 --> 14:43.930
<i>No, it really is.
It's hard.</i>

14:43.965 --> 14:45.832
<i>I mean, the ref's
gonna get you every time.</i>

14:45.867 --> 14:47.067
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.</i>

14:47.101 --> 14:49.136
<i>See, now the ref agrees
that's three pumps</i>

14:49.170 --> 14:51.005
<i>Right there.</i>

14:51.039 --> 14:53.607
<i>And the quarterback Ransom
under center.</i>

14:53.641 --> 14:55.508
<i>Last five minutes of the game.</i>

14:55.543 --> 14:57.244
<i>The Rhinos
are marching here again.</i>

14:57.278 --> 14:59.045
<i>Hard to stop this team
from scoring, Bill.</i>

14:59.080 --> 15:01.047
<i>They have so many weapons.</i>

15:01.081 --> 15:02.348
<i>Ransom takes the snap.</i>

15:02.383 --> 15:05.585
<i>And it's a shovel pass
to McCringleberry, who--</i>

15:05.620 --> 15:07.254
<i>He's at the 10.
He's at the 5.</i>

15:07.288 --> 15:09.623
<i>- And touchdown, Rhinos.
- Oh, my.</i>

15:09.657 --> 15:12.259
<i>Great block by Hardunkichud,
and that's gonna be</i>

15:12.293 --> 15:14.595
<i>tough for the Cougars
to come back from.</i>

15:14.629 --> 15:16.997
<i>Boy, what a career day
from Hingle McCringleberry,</i>

15:17.032 --> 15:18.332
<i>The rookie out of Penn State.</i>

15:18.366 --> 15:20.701
<i>Oh, he was just amazingly
fired up here today, Jim.</i>

15:20.735 --> 15:22.302
<i>You gotta love
the way this guy plays,</i>

15:22.336 --> 15:23.970
<i>- and he--
- </i>(both)<i> Ohh.</i>

15:24.004 --> 15:26.438
<i>- See, now there's one pump.
- Uh-oh.</i>

15:26.473 --> 15:28.173
<i>I cannot believe this kid.</i>

15:28.208 --> 15:30.676
<i>You got to put your team first
in situations like this,</i>

15:30.710 --> 15:32.511
<i>And McCringleberry's
just not doing that.</i>

15:32.545 --> 15:34.112
<i>Now there's two.
Jeff, now if he pumps</i>

15:34.147 --> 15:36.681
<i>a third time,
he will draw his third penalty</i>

15:36.716 --> 15:39.183
<i>for today.</i>

15:39.218 --> 15:42.687
<i>Everybody here waiting
with bated breath.</i>

15:42.721 --> 15:43.888
<i>- He did it.
- Oh, did he?</i>

15:43.922 --> 15:45.289
<i>- Yes, he did it.
- Oh. That's just--</i>

15:45.323 --> 15:47.158
<i>- Couldn't help himself.
- That's just amazing.</i>

15:47.192 --> 15:49.193
<i>I mean, come on,
in professional football--</i>

15:49.228 --> 15:50.695
<i>- it's a shame.
- That's what it is.</i>

15:50.729 --> 15:51.996
<i>- Yes, yes, it is.
- You can argue all you want,</i>

15:52.030 --> 15:53.464
<i>but the flag, well,
it's been thrown.</i>

15:53.498 --> 15:54.832
<i>That's right.
If it's three pumps,</i>

15:54.867 --> 15:56.367
<i>The ref's
not gonna take it away now.</i>

15:56.401 --> 15:58.335
<i>No, he's not.
Duration and intensity</i>

15:58.370 --> 16:00.004
<i>- doesn't make any difference.
- Well, Jeff, let's have a look</i>

16:00.038 --> 16:02.172
<i>at the replay here
to see if indeed he did do</i>

16:02.207 --> 16:04.508
<i>- the three pumps.
- All right. No question.</i>

16:04.543 --> 16:06.744
<i>- There is the first one, right?
- Yeah. Agreed.</i>

16:06.778 --> 16:08.980
<i>And then coming up</i>

16:09.014 --> 16:10.248
<i>- is the second one.
- Okay.</i>

16:10.282 --> 16:11.416
<i>Yes, very clear.</i>

16:11.450 --> 16:12.950
<i>- It's the third--
- We'll see it.</i>

16:12.985 --> 16:14.051
<i>- It's coming up right here.
- I'm just not sure.</i>

16:14.085 --> 16:15.185
<i>Oh, yeah,
you're right.</i>

16:15.220 --> 16:17.354
<i>There's absolutely
three pumps there.</i>

16:17.388 --> 16:19.289
<i>- Oh.
- Uh, apologies to all</i>

16:19.323 --> 16:20.557
<i>those watching
with young children.</i>

16:20.591 --> 16:21.591
<i>Clearly unintentional.</i>

16:24.883 --> 16:28.119
Our writing assistant James,
he's a white guy,

16:28.153 --> 16:31.488
And, you know, he basically--
his job is to kind

16:31.522 --> 16:33.256
of read back stuff
that we write,

16:33.291 --> 16:35.692
and so sometimes
we'll just mess with him

16:35.726 --> 16:38.862
by just, like, putting
the N-word in a sketch,

16:38.897 --> 16:40.364
like, 50 times.

16:40.398 --> 16:41.699
He does everything
in his power

16:41.733 --> 16:43.234
to be politically correct.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.268
James, read that back to me,
read that back to me.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.903
He's like, "All right,
well..."

16:45.937 --> 16:47.905
I gotta hear that back.
Quick, quick, fast, fast, fast.

16:47.939 --> 16:49.907
Read it fast,
Read it fast.

16:49.941 --> 16:51.475
- Uh...
- Rapid-fire, rapid-fire.

16:51.509 --> 16:52.676
I'm gonna read it with you.
I'm gonna read it with you.

16:52.711 --> 16:53.710
What's up, my unh?

16:53.745 --> 16:56.179
Ain't nothing wrong, man.

16:56.214 --> 16:57.714
I'm just hanging, my [bleep].
What's going on?

16:57.748 --> 17:00.926
Just unh, please.

17:02.519 --> 17:03.653
Don't go next door.

17:03.687 --> 17:05.021
There's some crazy [bleep]
over there.

17:05.055 --> 17:08.223
Uh, you got that right, unh.

17:11.722 --> 17:15.090
Marjorie,
I'd love a cupcake.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.760
Thank you so much
for coming today.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.628
As you know, every year
the vice president hosts

17:19.663 --> 17:22.265
The annual company luncheon,
so I brought you here

17:22.299 --> 17:24.701
to make sure that none
of my material could be

17:24.734 --> 17:26.069
in any way misconstrued

17:26.103 --> 17:29.072
as sexist or racist
or homophobic.

17:29.106 --> 17:32.108
So, if you hear anything that
could be in any way offensive

17:32.142 --> 17:34.610
to anyone,
just raise your hand, and--

17:34.645 --> 17:36.379
Oh, I haven't
really started yet.

17:36.414 --> 17:38.482
Did you find something
offensive?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.283
The fact that you think
I need a man's permission

17:40.318 --> 17:42.485
to raise my hand
is insane.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.255
I can raise my hand
whenever I want to raise my hand

17:45.289 --> 17:46.956
because I'm a free woman.

17:46.990 --> 17:48.624
So I should just raise my hand

17:48.659 --> 17:51.994
like this, like a big, old black
power fist, yeah, huh, boss man?

17:52.029 --> 17:53.262
Is that what you want from me?

17:53.297 --> 17:54.430
Is this what you wanted?

17:54.465 --> 17:56.299
A floppy gay hand

17:56.333 --> 17:57.967
just floating around
in the air.

17:58.001 --> 17:59.835
Well, here you go.
here's my floppy gay hand

17:59.870 --> 18:02.438
at the end
of my limp, gay wrist.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.640
- Happy?
- No.

18:03.674 --> 18:05.141
Jesus, no.

18:05.175 --> 18:06.576
Wow, what?

18:06.610 --> 18:08.745
Why not "Mary, no,"
Or "Rachel, no,"

18:08.779 --> 18:10.313
Or "Bathsheba, no"?

18:10.347 --> 18:12.782
Why does it have
to be Jesus, a man?

18:12.816 --> 18:14.918
And are we talking about
the Jesus that accepts everyone

18:14.952 --> 18:18.021
or the Jesus who doesn't believe
people should be able to love

18:18.055 --> 18:20.022
who they love?

18:20.057 --> 18:22.257
Oh, maybe I should just break
out in some gospel songs,

18:22.292 --> 18:24.660
screaming and hollering
and hooting,

18:24.694 --> 18:26.762
"Oh, Lordy, Lordy."

18:26.796 --> 18:28.397
No, this isn't the speech yet.

18:28.432 --> 18:29.765
Can I just do the speech?

18:29.800 --> 18:32.034
Oh, you want this bitch
to shut up?

18:32.069 --> 18:33.669
- Is that it?
- What's the matter?

18:33.703 --> 18:35.604
The black guy's
making way too much noise

18:35.638 --> 18:37.205
in your movie theater,
Massa?

18:37.239 --> 18:40.174
Forgive me for lisping
And lilting through your speech.

18:40.209 --> 18:42.677
- No, I just meant--
- (all) Whoa!

18:42.711 --> 18:45.647
What's with the hands, man?
I ain't gonna shoot ya.

18:45.681 --> 18:47.215
What, are you gonna grab
my breasts now?

18:47.249 --> 18:49.984
Protect yourself
from the gay invasion.

18:50.019 --> 18:53.655
- Guys.
- Ho, "Guys," should I leave?

18:53.689 --> 18:55.123
Sorry, men and women.

18:55.158 --> 18:56.959
Let's exclude everybody
who identifies themself

18:56.993 --> 18:58.627
as something else
because they're not people!

18:58.661 --> 18:59.728
I meant people.

18:59.762 --> 19:01.797
Whose people?
My people?

19:01.831 --> 19:03.566
Do I speak
for my people?

19:03.600 --> 19:06.035
- All right.
- More like "All white."

19:06.069 --> 19:07.636
More like "No rights."

19:07.670 --> 19:11.072
More like "Women are
second-class citizens, right?"

19:11.107 --> 19:14.810
Okay, stop, men, women,
people of all ethnicities,

19:14.844 --> 19:17.980
genders, sexual orientation,
religion,

19:18.014 --> 19:22.085
can I please just get
to my speech?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.420
Fine.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.323
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

19:26.517 --> 19:29.252
Okay, here goes.

19:29.286 --> 19:33.389
A Chinaman, a Pollock,
and an Arab walk into a bar--

19:33.423 --> 19:34.390
I love Arab jokes.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.191
Ching-chong,
bring it on.

19:36.226 --> 19:38.560
You had me at "Pollock."

19:39.774 --> 19:41.774
(<i>Hail to the Chief</i> playing)

19:43.433 --> 19:45.134
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

19:45.168 --> 19:48.572
Every day our citizens improve
the lives of those around them.

19:48.606 --> 19:51.041
Today we honor Troy Morrison.

19:51.075 --> 19:53.309
Now Troy was in geometry class

19:53.344 --> 19:56.379
when his teacher mentioned
the hypotenuse of a triangle.

19:56.414 --> 19:59.382
Troy said, "I wish I was high
on potenuse."

19:59.417 --> 20:00.784
That really cracked me up,

20:00.818 --> 20:03.353
and it cracked up
the rest of America too,

20:03.387 --> 20:06.022
so today I'm pleased
to present Troy

20:06.057 --> 20:08.825
with the Congressional
Comedy Medal of Honor.

20:08.860 --> 20:11.962
Troy, on behalf
of the entire country,

20:11.996 --> 20:14.198
I just want to thank you

20:14.232 --> 20:17.768
for your fantastic,
off-the-cuff line.

20:17.802 --> 20:19.703
you are a true comedy hero.

20:19.738 --> 20:22.005
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.442
And also, Mr. President,
I have something for you.

20:24.476 --> 20:29.013
What's that?
Oh! He got me one.

20:29.047 --> 20:31.148
Yes.
These are sold out.

20:31.183 --> 20:33.184
I haven't been able to get
my hands on one of these.

20:33.218 --> 20:35.553
Thanks, Troy.
Oh, my God.

20:35.587 --> 20:37.154
"High on pot-enuse."

20:37.189 --> 20:38.556
(cheers and applause)

20:38.590 --> 20:40.057
We killed that last one.

20:40.091 --> 20:42.059
Talkin' about
ah, ah, ah!

20:42.093 --> 20:43.293
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on, come on.

20:43.328 --> 20:44.999
That's excessive.
That's excessive.

20:45.171 --> 20:47.171
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

20:47.671 --> 20:49.671
(cheers and applause)
