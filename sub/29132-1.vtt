01:29.123 --> 01:31.990
Wow, these are amazing.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.908
Hey.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.478
Is somebody there?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.075
What do you want?

04:04.311 --> 04:06.245
Why did you bring me here?

05:55.789 --> 05:56.988
Eric!

05:58.392 --> 06:00.225
Eric, are you okay?

06:04.131 --> 06:05.564
I'm good.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.467
I just can't get that
thought out of my head.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.107
Okay.

06:25.886 --> 06:30.756
Thank you for joining
us, let's get started.

06:30.824 --> 06:36.228
Welcome to the Alien Contact
and Abduction Support Group.

06:36.230 --> 06:41.700
This is a group where we
offer a non-judgemental place

06:41.702 --> 06:43.435
for people that have experienced

06:43.437 --> 06:47.572
the phenomenon of alien
contact and abduction.

06:47.574 --> 06:51.943
We offer guidance
and emotional support

06:52.546 --> 06:55.280
and I know through
years of research that

06:55.282 --> 06:59.951
people are often left with
more questions than answers

06:59.953 --> 07:04.523
and often this leads one
to a state of confusion.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.358
But here, we hope that we can

07:06.360 --> 07:09.327
shed some light on
your experience.

07:11.465 --> 07:14.266
Maybe all of us can
help you find some peace

07:14.268 --> 07:18.470
and understanding for your
particular experience.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.606
I understand what
you're going through.

07:22.409 --> 07:26.711
It took me six months
to come to a meeting.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.750
How did you find out about us?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.856
No one believes what happened

07:37.858 --> 07:41.193
to me out there in the desert.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.528
I was out there
because I was meeting

07:43.530 --> 07:47.332
friends in Vegas and
thought I'd stop by

07:47.334 --> 07:51.937
the Trona Pinnacles
and take some photos.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.541
I told my friends and family but

07:56.543 --> 07:59.578
after awhile after I kept
telling them about my

07:59.580 --> 08:05.584
experience and how I felt
that they were talking to me,

08:05.853 --> 08:09.287
they just stopped coming around.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.090
I still have nightmares.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.893
I started to think
that I was crazy

08:14.895 --> 08:17.963
and that I just
dreamt it all up.

08:17.965 --> 08:22.734
But I know, I know
that this is true.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.571
Something happened to me out
there in the desert and I

08:26.573 --> 08:30.275
keep getting these headaches
when I think about it too much.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.078
I finally did some

08:34.081 --> 08:37.249
research on alien abductions

08:38.251 --> 08:39.284
and I found this group.

08:39.285 --> 08:42.921
Yeah, that's because
they're watching us.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.324
I know because they talk to me.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.060
That's why I wear this.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.763
Right John?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.633
Yes, I believe there
is a phenomenon

08:54.635 --> 08:57.269
that I experienced when
I was in the military

08:57.271 --> 09:01.673
and I've felt the
same way as all of us.

09:02.242 --> 09:08.847
But I wear this because I don't
want to be found... by anyone.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.515
Me either but I don't wanna

09:10.517 --> 09:12.617
have to wear
something like that.

09:12.619 --> 09:16.555
Mm mm, I lost all my
friends and family.

09:16.557 --> 09:20.592
It's 'cause they
were taken by them.

09:21.061 --> 09:26.231
They're not gonna get
me again, no way, uh-uh.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.134
What made you
decide to come here?

09:30.771 --> 09:35.407
I was having these
nightmares all the time.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.476
I just wanted them to stop.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.946
I still don't know what
happened to my husband.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.481
My nightmares haven't
stopped neither,

09:43.483 --> 09:45.951
and I've been coming
here almost six months.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.053
Yeah, yeah we know. We
all have to hear you

09:48.055 --> 09:50.188
talk about it for
the last six months.

09:50.190 --> 09:54.292
- Screw you, Melanie.
- Hey calm down everyone.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.994
One at a time.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.965
We're not here to judge
each other's experiences.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.701
We're here to welcome Eric.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.870
I want to thank you
again for sharing.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.674
Since this is Eric's
first time here,

10:09.676 --> 10:11.176
I thought we'd all go around

10:11.178 --> 10:15.680
the room and tell him
why we're all here.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.318
Why don't we start
with you, Becky?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.490
Okay.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.895
I had a husband.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.799
We were really in love.

10:36.069 --> 10:41.039
Then we went camping
one night in the woods.

10:59.893 --> 11:00.859
What are you doing?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.695
I want to document
our trip, babe.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.996
Could you not?

11:05.699 --> 11:06.498
Why not?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.099
Because
I don't feel like being filmed

11:08.101 --> 11:11.469
right now, okay?
You wanna stop, please?

11:21.581 --> 11:24.816
Okay guys, go night night.

11:43.904 --> 11:44.936
The dogs sleepin' okay?

11:44.938 --> 11:48.873
Yeah, I think they
really like it here.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.079
What is that?

11:57.517 --> 11:58.550
I don't know.

11:58.552 --> 12:02.353
I mean it's too far in the
woods to be car headlights.

12:04.491 --> 12:08.793
It's probably just another
camper with a lantern.

12:08.795 --> 12:13.732
I've never seen a
lantern like that before,

12:14.067 --> 12:15.266
it's weird.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.001
You know what,
it's probably just

12:17.003 --> 12:18.937
the Park Ranger comin'
around and makin'

12:18.939 --> 12:24.175
sure everybody's camping
permits are up to date.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.410
Yeah...

12:25.946 --> 12:27.212
maybe.

12:32.486 --> 12:35.019
Jimmy, Daisy, quiet.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.456
Quiet, knock it off.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.728
Something's got 'em spooked.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.996
Listen.

12:45.198 --> 12:50.902
It's a weird noise, it's no
animal, it's not crickets.

12:51.271 --> 12:55.306
I don't know what it
is, you don't hear it?

12:57.811 --> 13:00.512
But I definitely don't have
a good feeling about this.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.883
There it is again.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.154
What is that?

13:09.456 --> 13:12.924
I have no idea what that is.

13:15.095 --> 13:19.164
It's really creepin' me
out babe, go get the gun.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.051
Okay, let's go take a look.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.755
Okay, you go first.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.203
Harry.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.639
Snap out of it.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.676
Harry!

15:51.051 --> 15:52.583
Leave him alone!

17:00.920 --> 17:02.186
Harry?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.323
Harry!

17:09.596 --> 17:11.429
Leave him alone.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.674
What happened?

17:56.676 --> 17:57.942
Harry?

18:01.581 --> 18:04.348
Harry, what is that thing?

18:05.385 --> 18:07.618
What happened in the woods?

18:08.621 --> 18:10.588
Calm down, Becky.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.491
This is a gift.

18:15.462 --> 18:20.064
This will solve
all the problems.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.700
What are you talking about?

18:22.702 --> 18:25.636
I must bring this
into the world.

18:26.473 --> 18:30.241
It is a gift for everyone.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.011
How do you know that?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.951
They told me.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.822
Who's "they," Harry?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.062
You'll see.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.477
Jimmy, Daisy, no, leave it.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.652
No, oh my god, no!

19:19.492 --> 19:20.725
Jimmy?

19:21.694 --> 19:22.960
Daisy?

19:24.464 --> 19:25.696
Jimmy?

19:27.333 --> 19:28.599
Daisy?

19:29.903 --> 19:31.636
Come on, guys.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.337
Daisy?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.072
Jimmy?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.543
Daisy?

19:39.746 --> 19:41.012
Jimmy?

19:44.117 --> 19:45.850
Come on, guys.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.585
Daisy?

19:49.055 --> 19:50.221
Jimmy?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.056
Don't scream.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.593
Who are you, what are
you doing out here?

19:55.595 --> 19:59.230
I know what's happening right
now, I saw what happened.

19:59.232 --> 20:03.201
- What are you talking about?
- The crystal, your husband.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.269
- The visions.
- How do you know about that?

20:05.271 --> 20:08.539
We can't let it happen,
it's got to be stopped.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.941
Stop what?

20:09.943 --> 20:11.008
We can't let him take

20:11.010 --> 20:14.612
the crystal into the
city full of people.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.781
Think of what will happen.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.616
They don't want to
save the planet,

20:18.618 --> 20:22.186
they want to sterilize
the entire planet.

20:22.188 --> 20:25.022
I have seen the visions.

20:26.359 --> 20:30.628
What are we supposed to
do, get rid of the crystal?

20:30.630 --> 20:33.531
The crystal can't be destroyed.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.633
All we can do is
hide it for now.

20:35.635 --> 20:40.738
But they always seem to find
it and find another way.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.939
How do you know that?

20:41.941 --> 20:45.509
The same thing happened to
my wife and many others.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.145
I've seen it happen
several times.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.447
What are we supposed to do?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.916
We've got to get the
crystal from him.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.784
We gotta get it back.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.518
How?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.487
Every time I grab
it, I get burned.

20:56.489 --> 21:01.859
We have to do something or
else this is what will happen.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.798
How did they die?

21:07.800 --> 21:13.404
All of them victims, my
wife is buried there too.

21:14.274 --> 21:20.611
She went mad when she found the
crystal, she killed herself.

21:20.913 --> 21:24.749
I buried her here to
hide her and the crystal,

21:24.751 --> 21:29.387
hoping no one would ever
have to suffer the same fate.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.357
Your husband can't take

21:33.359 --> 21:36.694
the crystal into the
city, he just can't.

21:36.896 --> 21:41.565
We better hurry because
he can't get very far.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.634
I've got the keys.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.979
You need to go in
and distract him.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.982
I'll see if we can take
the crystal from him.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.951
Okay, I'll talk to him.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.894
Harry?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.365
What are you looking for, babe?

22:14.434 --> 22:15.333
The keys, okay?

22:15.335 --> 22:18.035
I need the car keys, we
gotta get outta here.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.637
I don't know, why?

22:19.639 --> 22:21.439
We gotta go back
to town, all right?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.841
I'll explain later but
where are the damn keys?

22:23.843 --> 22:27.778
- Babe, what's going on?
- Stop yelling at me please.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.815
It hurts, where's the keys?

22:31.417 --> 22:33.184
- Baby please.
- Oh my god.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.619
We gotta get outta here, please!

22:36.989 --> 22:39.357
I didn't mean
for you to hurt him.

22:39.359 --> 22:42.393
Don't be fooled, he's
not your husband anymore.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.961
He's not trying to
get to a hospital,

22:43.963 --> 22:47.331
he's trying to get to the city.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.269
Wait, don't do it.

22:52.271 --> 22:55.072
You remember the last
time you did that?

22:55.074 --> 22:56.941
I have to try.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.064
Stop!

24:00.106 --> 24:01.705
Harry, stop!

24:02.208 --> 24:04.208
Stop, Harry stop!

24:07.413 --> 24:08.946
Please stop.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.752
Stop.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.151
Please...

25:55.087 --> 25:56.854
let me go home.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.293
Please.

26:03.996 --> 26:07.331
Don't you have any compassion?

26:08.134 --> 26:09.500
Let me go.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.069
Let us go.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.119
Where's my husband?

27:02.521 --> 27:07.024
He's gone already, I
tried my best to stop him.

27:08.628 --> 27:09.593
What can I do?

27:09.595 --> 27:14.264
- Nobody's gonna believe me.
- You have to keep going.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.801
All right, come on.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.470
Oh, my arms are broken.

27:19.472 --> 27:24.141
If you wanna have a
chance, just leave me.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.393
Harry, wait!

29:31.670 --> 29:33.036
Hey lady.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.974
Help me.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.687
So how did
you get so far out here?

29:50.689 --> 29:54.358
My husband's hurt, I'm
trying to find him.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.026
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about

29:56.028 --> 30:00.831
with all that but let me get
you to the hospital, okay?

30:04.303 --> 30:06.670
Wait stop stop stop, that's him.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.940
Let me out, let me out.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.875
Are you sure you wanna do this?

30:11.877 --> 30:14.711
Isn't that the guy who hurt you?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.015
Harry.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.583
Harry, wait.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.796
May I get a ride into the city?

31:05.798 --> 31:08.065
Hop in.

31:27.620 --> 31:33.624
To this day, I know they
implanted something in my tooth.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.859
I can hear them every day.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.763
Do you hear them right now?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.465
No.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.234
They talk to me when I'm alone

31:44.236 --> 31:46.970
or when I'm with a non-believer.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.306
They wanna make you look crazy.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.075
They implanted
something in my head too

31:52.077 --> 31:56.179
except I hear these
high pitched sounds

31:56.181 --> 31:58.348
and somehow I can
understand them but

31:58.350 --> 32:03.353
they only communicate
with me when I'm sleeping,

32:03.355 --> 32:04.755
in my dreams.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.758
Thank you for your honesty

32:07.760 --> 32:10.961
and most importantly,
your courage.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.670
Pardon me, everyone.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.517
I'm sorry to bother you.

32:33.519 --> 32:36.920
Is this the alien
abduction group?

32:36.922 --> 32:40.891
- How can I help you?
- My daughter, she's missing.

32:40.893 --> 32:44.027
I found out about you
and I need your help.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.162
If she's missing, why don't

32:45.164 --> 32:46.763
you just go to
the police, ma'am?

32:46.765 --> 32:52.069
No, you don't understand,
I think she was abducted.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.071
I think you should let her in,

32:54.073 --> 32:55.505
I think she's telling the truth.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.308
I don't think this
is a good idea.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.244
- They could've followed her.
- I think Matt's right.

33:01.246 --> 33:02.779
How do we know she's
not one of them?

33:02.781 --> 33:05.682
Because look at her,
she's terrified.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.719
I do not like this idea,
she could be one of them.

33:08.721 --> 33:13.457
I really think she needs to
go, they could've followed her.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.959
Matt, that's enough.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.664
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

33:24.303 --> 33:28.805
I know you don't know who I
am but I'm telling the truth.

33:28.807 --> 33:33.677
My daughter was babysitting
while she was away at college.

33:33.679 --> 33:37.180
- Where is she now?
- I don't know.

33:37.182 --> 33:41.385
The last I heard from her,
she left me this message.

33:43.322 --> 33:48.925
Mom, I
hope you get this.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.372
Hi mom, I'm at my
babysitting job.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.540
I'm going to be studying tonight

34:03.542 --> 34:05.909
because I have my
Astrology exam next week.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.677
You're gonna be really
happy to hear this.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.914
Once I finish, I'm finally
going to be able to graduate

34:10.916 --> 34:14.351
and get my Doctorate so that
I can write my dissertation.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.820
I know you don't want
me going to Puerto Rico

34:16.822 --> 34:20.190
but they have the
largest telescope there.

34:20.192 --> 34:22.626
I know you're thinking,
what is she talking about?

34:22.628 --> 34:26.263
Oh by the way, there's going
to be a lunar eclipse tonight.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.366
So I hope you get a chance
to go outside and see it.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.801
Well I'm putting
my phone on vibrate

34:30.803 --> 34:32.735
because I don't want
to wake the baby,

34:32.737 --> 34:36.106
so I'll talk to you later, bye.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.927
Pleasant dreams, little one.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.539
Hi.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.242
No, you cannot.

35:13.045 --> 35:15.512
Brian, this is important to me.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.514
Besides, they don't
even know you and they

35:17.516 --> 35:21.084
would not appreciate
me having guests over.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.889
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

35:25.891 --> 35:28.992
Let's get together for
lunch for sure, okay?

35:31.130 --> 35:32.662
Hello?

35:32.664 --> 35:33.930
Brian?

35:50.749 --> 35:52.048
Weird.

35:54.319 --> 35:57.454
Where would the fuse box be?

36:34.092 --> 36:35.358
Kitty?

36:36.762 --> 36:38.028
Kitty?

36:42.100 --> 36:43.366
Okay.

37:39.791 --> 37:43.660
<i>They're coming to
get you, Barbara.</i>

37:43.662 --> 37:46.696
<i>Stop it, you're ignorant.</i>

37:48.066 --> 37:50.033
<i>Oh, no.</i>

37:50.035 --> 37:53.536
<i>I said
you will call no one.</i>

38:00.612 --> 38:01.845
Hello?

38:07.586 --> 38:13.890
<i>You will listen to my orders,
you will listen and obey.</i>

38:14.459 --> 38:16.893
Hello, who's there?

38:26.838 --> 38:28.104
Whoa.

38:35.847 --> 38:39.449
Dammit, it's still not working.

39:37.075 --> 39:40.577
Oh no.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.345
What happened?

40:05.337 --> 40:07.537
Hello, Mrs. Murphy.

40:07.806 --> 40:12.075
Yes, went to bed
about 30 minutes ago.

40:13.378 --> 40:17.180
Are you having a good
time at the party?

40:17.182 --> 40:21.684
Well yeah, everything's
good here except...

40:21.753 --> 40:26.689
the electricity went out,
the TV's been acting funny.

40:26.691 --> 40:30.760
Also the landline,
it's not working.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.798
Well, don't worry,
I'm sure everything

40:34.800 --> 40:37.500
will be fine by the
time you're back.

40:37.502 --> 40:40.403
My phone is fully charged.

40:41.206 --> 40:44.607
I'll see you guys in a
couple of hours.

40:45.710 --> 40:46.876
Bye.

41:59.317 --> 42:00.483
Hello?

42:09.427 --> 42:11.427
Is anybody there?

42:16.668 --> 42:18.334
What is that?

42:31.182 --> 42:34.017
Hello? Can I help you?

42:34.185 --> 42:36.319
Actually I came over
to check on you.

42:36.321 --> 42:41.090
Our electricity went out and
has not come back on yet.

42:41.092 --> 42:44.027
Our electricity went
out here too but

42:44.029 --> 42:45.228
I managed to get it back on.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.498
Maybe the electric company
hasn't fixed ours yet.

42:48.500 --> 42:49.699
Well can I help you with

42:49.701 --> 42:52.802
anything else,
candles, flashlights?

42:52.804 --> 42:57.040
- No, we're good for now.
- Well thanks for stopping by.

42:57.042 --> 42:57.974
One more thing.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.543
I think something got
the cat here on the porch.

43:04.516 --> 43:05.982
That's terrible.

43:05.984 --> 43:08.351
Probably a wild
dog or something.

43:08.353 --> 43:11.487
Something funny's
definitely going on.

43:11.489 --> 43:14.223
Well lock your doors, goodnight.

43:14.225 --> 43:15.725
Goodnight.

44:35.607 --> 44:37.440
Hello, hello?

44:40.078 --> 44:41.344
Hello?

44:41.780 --> 44:43.012
Damn it.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.385
Hello?

45:27.659 --> 45:28.825
No.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.159
No.

45:30.328 --> 45:31.527
No.

45:32.430 --> 45:33.930
No.

48:18.129 --> 48:19.395
Help!

49:03.007 --> 49:04.440
I'm coming.

49:50.488 --> 49:51.687
No!

49:55.960 --> 49:57.626
Not the baby!

50:13.544 --> 50:15.845
Well that was fun.

50:16.014 --> 50:18.147
I gotta get up in
five hours.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.650
Look out!

50:22.387 --> 50:23.586
No!

50:33.464 --> 50:35.331
No!

50:36.567 --> 50:37.767
No!

50:38.703 --> 50:39.902
No!

50:58.790 --> 51:02.291
Mom, I
hope you get this.

51:02.293 --> 51:08.130
You have to believe there's
something here killing us.

51:08.566 --> 51:10.666
I hear it coming.

51:11.869 --> 51:13.903
Can you hear it?

51:13.905 --> 51:15.538
From the sky.

51:39.330 --> 51:41.230
I haven't heard from her since.

51:41.232 --> 51:45.101
I went to the house but nothing,
there's no trace of her.

51:45.103 --> 51:47.536
What about the kid's parents?

51:47.538 --> 51:48.304
Missing.

51:48.306 --> 51:51.107
How are you so certain
it's an alien abduction

51:51.109 --> 51:53.476
and why would you
come to us for help?

51:53.478 --> 51:56.545
When I went to look for
her, I found her phone.

51:56.547 --> 51:58.681
And when I looked at it,
it contained video

51:58.683 --> 52:02.618
of what happened. At least
what I could see.

52:02.620 --> 52:05.287
Do you have it, the proof?

52:05.289 --> 52:08.324
- Yes I do.
- I don't believe you.

52:39.991 --> 52:44.460
I knew it, I knew it, I've
seen it, I knew I wasn't crazy.

52:44.462 --> 52:49.265
Wait, you're saying that
that is what took you?

52:49.267 --> 52:50.799
That's not what took me.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.468
That's not what took me either.

52:53.037 --> 52:54.537
Are you calling me a liar?

52:54.539 --> 52:55.771
Why does everybody else have

52:55.773 --> 52:56.906
a different experience than you?

52:56.908 --> 52:58.274
I don't know, I just
know what I saw.

52:58.276 --> 53:00.843
Guys, this isn't the
place for judgements.

53:00.845 --> 53:03.212
What if all our
experiences are different?

53:03.214 --> 53:06.048
What if there are
other alien species?

53:06.050 --> 53:07.082
- What?
- Yes.

53:07.084 --> 53:09.652
Other aliens here
doing the same thing.

53:09.654 --> 53:12.621
Another species,
that's a good point.

53:12.623 --> 53:15.124
What about it, John?

53:16.027 --> 53:16.859
Ah!

53:16.861 --> 53:20.296
Oh my god!

53:26.370 --> 53:31.540
Take this, put this
over your back tooth.

53:32.009 --> 53:35.077
Hold this behind your neck.

53:37.315 --> 53:38.948
Are you okay?

53:43.621 --> 53:45.754
How did you know how to do that?

53:46.023 --> 53:50.159
- They must be implanted.
- Implanted?

53:50.294 --> 53:54.763
You mean there's
something inside of them?

53:55.166 --> 53:58.400
- Are they listening?
- Perhaps.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.502
But we're blocking it now.

54:00.504 --> 54:03.305
Is that thing real on the video?

54:03.774 --> 54:05.975
Where did you find that phone?

54:05.977 --> 54:07.810
It was laying next
to the baby crib

54:07.812 --> 54:10.412
when I went inside to
look for my daughter.

54:10.414 --> 54:11.580
What if it was left there?

54:11.582 --> 54:13.315
You think they
did it on purpose?

54:13.317 --> 54:14.717
Why else would
they lead her here?

54:14.719 --> 54:18.921
I think they might be trying
to give us some information.

54:18.923 --> 54:22.891
You said you found that phone
by the baby's crib, right?

54:22.893 --> 54:26.695
I don't know, there
was no sign of a baby.

54:26.697 --> 54:30.833
Just a smell, I've
never smelt it before.

54:30.835 --> 54:33.235
What kind of smell?

54:34.272 --> 54:37.339
I mean what did
it remind you of?

54:37.341 --> 54:39.942
Maybe like meat, not quite

54:39.944 --> 54:43.178
fresh but not rotted yet either.

54:43.180 --> 54:45.481
I know that smell, like a fresh

54:45.483 --> 54:48.050
piece of steak right
before you cook it.

54:48.052 --> 54:50.486
- Yeah, like that.
- Yeah.

54:50.488 --> 54:51.687
That's the smell I sensed right

54:51.689 --> 54:55.291
before they took my
family and my friends.

55:08.839 --> 55:13.709
This is Deacon, I'm at
the remote location.

55:16.113 --> 55:18.213
No bodies, no one.

55:18.316 --> 55:24.687
It's happened again, the smell
is unbearable, putrefaction.

55:25.890 --> 55:28.757
The species was dominant.

55:33.331 --> 55:36.665
Same thing, she's on the move.

55:49.680 --> 55:53.515
Here tilt your head back,
put pressure on it okay?

55:53.517 --> 55:56.352
It'll take the
swelling off your face.

55:59.256 --> 56:00.456
Aspirin?

56:04.495 --> 56:07.262
Do you want some aspirin?

56:07.865 --> 56:09.465
- Go on.
- It's just aspirin.

56:09.467 --> 56:13.435
- It'll help with the pain.
- Take it.

56:14.405 --> 56:18.040
Please don't let my
husband anywhere near me.

56:21.645 --> 56:24.680
Do you have pain anywhere else?

56:32.423 --> 56:35.557
I knew it, that's where
he was kicking her.

56:36.293 --> 56:38.460
Is it hard for you to breathe?

56:39.296 --> 56:41.530
- No.
- Good.

56:42.733 --> 56:44.800
What's your name?

56:46.737 --> 56:49.071
It's Kara, he's
usually a good man.

56:49.073 --> 56:52.975
It's just that he has
a really short temper.

56:52.977 --> 56:58.747
It's okay Kara, it's okay,
you're safe now all right?

56:58.749 --> 57:02.518
My name is Adrian, do you
remember how you got here?

57:07.024 --> 57:11.760
I've just never seen
him like that before.

57:11.762 --> 57:13.262
All right.

57:13.330 --> 57:17.833
You can stay here as long as
you want, you're safe okay?

57:18.702 --> 57:19.902
Hello?

57:20.104 --> 57:21.170
Hello?

57:21.505 --> 57:22.304
Hello?

57:22.306 --> 57:23.906
Why do you keep trying
to use your cell phones?

57:23.908 --> 57:27.042
You know we don't have
reception up here.

57:27.044 --> 57:28.644
I always try my cell phone.

57:28.646 --> 57:31.480
Why when you know
it doesn't work?

57:31.482 --> 57:32.381
I don't know.

57:32.383 --> 57:33.749
This is why you
should have landlines

57:33.751 --> 57:35.517
for emergencies
like this, not cool.

57:35.519 --> 57:38.053
I've had one before
and people abused it.

57:38.055 --> 57:40.289
We are out in the
middle of nowhere.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.925
Who is gonna help us,
what do we do with her?

57:42.927 --> 57:44.092
Where are we gonna take her?

57:44.094 --> 57:46.094
Outside, upstairs,
what are we gonna do?

57:46.096 --> 57:47.796
Not yet, no.

57:48.232 --> 57:50.866
Let me get her water.

57:51.502 --> 57:54.136
Here, give that to her.

57:56.273 --> 57:58.440
Sip that, it'll help.

57:58.442 --> 58:01.109
I promise it'll help you.

58:01.111 --> 58:03.612
Listen to my voice,
you need to drink something.

58:03.614 --> 58:07.783
Do you have any other areas of
pain, are you feeling dizzy?

58:08.085 --> 58:12.254
I have never seen
him like that before.

58:12.256 --> 58:15.224
He's been so different lately.

58:15.226 --> 58:17.659
I'm gonna go check on him.

58:17.661 --> 58:19.194
They usually get like
that before they're

58:19.196 --> 58:22.197
about to get caught
doing something stupid.

58:22.199 --> 58:25.133
How often does he do this?

58:25.436 --> 58:30.973
There's something very
different about him lately.

58:31.075 --> 58:35.911
That's usually the
first sign of an affair.

58:37.882 --> 58:43.986
It's okay, it's okay, it's
just water, it's just water.

58:47.525 --> 58:50.425
What is that, will you
go check on them please?

58:50.427 --> 58:53.996
Make sure they have the
situation under control.

59:00.571 --> 59:03.772
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

59:07.478 --> 59:12.414
No, don't you go passing
out on me. Not yet.

59:12.416 --> 59:15.217
You still think you're a big
mother, don't you?

59:15.219 --> 59:17.920
- Don't you?
- I didn't--

59:18.756 --> 59:20.088
I did not!

59:20.257 --> 59:22.391
You did not what, homes?

59:22.393 --> 59:24.993
- Beat the piss outta your wife?
- No, I didn't!

59:24.995 --> 59:26.295
Liar!

59:26.830 --> 59:28.263
Stop.

59:28.332 --> 59:29.197
Stop.

59:29.199 --> 59:31.967
Uncle Tony, please
just do what they say.

59:31.969 --> 59:34.836
Please, if you stop now,

59:35.940 --> 59:37.039
I won't press charges.

59:37.041 --> 59:40.542
Why do you still come in
my room and watch me sleep?

59:40.544 --> 59:41.777
What?

59:41.779 --> 59:42.578
What?

59:42.580 --> 59:44.212
Bitch, you're crazy, my
hands have been tied

59:44.214 --> 59:48.483
since you crazy broads
brought me here.

59:57.294 --> 59:58.694
No.

59:58.696 --> 59:59.928
Yeah.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.530
- What are you doing?
- How 'bout this?

01:00:01.532 --> 01:00:04.399
- What are you doing?
- Did you say "press charges"?

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:07.202
Well the Sheriff's gonna
be here in just a few hours

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:10.172
and we're gonna press
charges on your ass.

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.340
Cindy, don't do this.

01:00:11.342 --> 01:00:14.209
He obviously needs
help, I mean maybe--

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:17.379
Don't talk to me like you
know me or like we're friends.

01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:21.450
Maybe it'd be better if
you went and sat outside.

01:00:21.452 --> 01:00:22.484
That's right sweets,

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.620
new girls need to
mind their neck, okay?

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:27.089
- It's such a crazy day.
- You're crazy.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.925
You think I want
this dude saved?

01:00:29.927 --> 01:00:32.928
- Don't move.
- He raped me.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:37.199
My uncle raped me.

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:38.000
What?

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:41.136
I didn't rape you,
I didn't touch you!

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:45.140
Touch me again Uncle
Tony, I swear to God

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:48.510
I will slit your throat and
I will not call the police.

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:50.846
You don't know what you
have in that kitchen.

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:53.649
I'm about sick of this guy.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.453
Oh, Jesus!

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:03.959
You tore that nose up like
you were cuttin' paper.

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:06.328
His old ass felt like paper.

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:11.099
Oh no, you did not
just headbutt me.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.907
That son of a bitch passed
out on us again, Cindy.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:21.543
We'll see about that.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:27.482
What are you doing?

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.418
What are you doing?

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.387
What does it look
like I'm doing?

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:36.124
Look--

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:57.379
Jesus.

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:59.981
I was knitting a
blanket with that.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.150
I am not the enemy here.

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:03.785
The enemy's in that room.

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:06.955
You have no idea
what she's gonna do.

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:10.192
You people decided to attack
me and not hear reason.

01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:11.626
You hit me with a rock before

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:13.462
you could hear
what was going on!

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:16.098
We heard screaming and
we followed the screams

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.401
to a clearing to find
you beating your wife.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:21.436
- She--
- You were choking her!

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:25.640
You took your knee and
stabbed it in her face.

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:27.876
Which I doubt you
would do that again.

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:29.911
Please. Don't do this.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.546
You need me.

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:36.318
Melanie, don't.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.254
What are you doing to him?

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:44.092
This doesn't make it right.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:47.462
You all were doing so well.

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:53.001
Please, they're
trying to kill me.

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:53.869
Shut up.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:59.407
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to my girls.

01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:02.778
You're all mentally deranged.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:06.281
- I can't stomach your face.
- You need to understand.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.916
Something's there in
the next room waiting.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:12.988
My daddy was a monster and
you know what he would do?

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:15.624
He would put me in
the corner of a room

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:21.096
and he would beat me with
anything he could find.

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:23.465
So don't you dare

01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:26.935
tell me what a monster is.

01:03:27.738 --> 01:03:31.606
Cindy, will you go and
make us some tea please?

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.041
Would you like some tea?

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:36.578
I was just thinking, as I was
getting my ass kicked in,

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:42.017
I could certainly go for some
Royal English breakfast tea.

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:44.186
You're so disrespectful.

01:03:44.188 --> 01:03:46.054
Melanie, enough.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:49.624
Go check on Kara,
see if she's hungry.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:54.529
Is that her name, Kara?

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:59.167
Cindy, the English breakfast
tea will be just fine.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.571
Can you also bring me a
first aid kit, please?

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:06.541
I don't want-- what
is your name again?

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.310
- It's Edgar Price.
- Edgar.

01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:12.547
I don't want Edgar bleeding
all over my floors.

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:18.286
Well Edgar, my name is Adrian,
you do know where you are?

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:21.223
I just need to finish
what I set out to do.

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:22.591
And what is that?

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:25.827
I need to kill the last of
'em before the next phase.

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:27.662
I'm sorry, I'm
not following you.

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:30.198
Look, you people
are in grave danger

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.934
as long as that thing
is under this roof.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:35.770
Are you referring
to your wife, Kara?

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:38.573
- She's not a thing.
- That's not my wife.

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:42.978
You can't take out all
your anger on women.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.080
Women are special.

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:48.083
Men are too.

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.452
I named this house
when I opened it

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:52.387
the Sullivan House
after Anne Sullivan.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:56.424
You people are man-bashers
that hide behind a cause?

01:04:56.426 --> 01:05:01.563
Don't you know what's about
to go down here, Adrian?

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:04.633
I will not be a victim no more.

01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:07.636
Lady, if we don't get outta here

01:05:07.638 --> 01:05:11.139
in about 45 minutes,
we're all gonna be dead.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.341
That's how long a phase takes.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:18.046
Cindy was forced to get
high with her father

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:22.050
and then violently
used as a punching bag.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.853
She's been in our
program for 90 days.

01:05:24.855 --> 01:05:27.956
Well I'm thinking they
all had a relapse.

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.237
It's called anger.

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:45.206
Sometimes you see something
and it triggers a memory,

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:47.943
no matter how much a
person has changed.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:51.212
So yeah, I guess you
could say we had a relapse,

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:53.415
but when we see somebody
beating their wife,

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:59.287
nearly killing them, we lose
our shit, then we strike.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.091
I guess you have
a story as well.

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:05.527
How do you take your tea, Edgar?

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:11.366
Lady, enough with the games,
tea time is over, untie me.

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:13.468
I was seven

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.971
when my mother died.

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:19.007
That's when my father
turned to alcohol.

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:24.980
He used to lock me in closets
every time I pissed him off.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.916
That's when I ended
up in a shelter

01:06:27.918 --> 01:06:33.888
and I read <i> The Miracle Worker,</i>
and that changed my life.

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:36.691
It made me want to help.

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:41.463
So I wanted to open up a
place for battered women.

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:45.000
You save lives, that's
very noble of you.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.569
Well let me tell you what's
about to go down here.

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:51.339
Kara, she'll be coming out
to conclude the last phase

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:55.443
at the Sullivan House if
you don't untie me now!

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:58.313
What type of work
do you do, Edgar?

01:06:58.315 --> 01:06:59.080
What?

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:01.883
She asked what type
of work do you do?

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:05.120
- I work for the government.
- Doing?

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:09.791
- I work for the government--
- Is your job stressful?

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:10.558
Yes.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.261
What exactly do you
do for the government?

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:14.729
I work for a group that monitors

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:17.665
extraterrestrial
life here on earth.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:18.633
What?

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.769
Like E.T.?

01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:24.706
Lady, you wish they
all look like E.T.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.141
They are ruthless,

01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:29.444
they walk amongst us
imitating what we do.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.713
All they need is
some sort of DNA from

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:35.683
that person and then
they multiply and feast.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:37.719
When that happens, they call us.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:42.657
We are highly trained to
seek out and destroy, period!

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:45.693
No matter what or who
they transform into,

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:49.464
you cannot look at
them as human, period!

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:52.801
She's an alien, your
wife's an alien?

01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:55.003
She ate my wife.

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.505
What they eat, they become.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:59.140
That's when they
can be put down.

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:02.377
During their transformational
stage, they're vulnerable.

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:06.214
Their personal protection
field is shut down.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.249
They are here to,

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:11.152
where's that other girl
Melanie, where'd she go?

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:13.154
- Oh chill out--
- Checking on E.T.

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:15.223
She's been with her
too long, call her.

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:17.725
She's probably
trying to phone home.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.127
Call her.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.496
Chill out, enough with this.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.729
Melanie?

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:27.268
- Melanie?
- Untie me now!

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.435
Mel.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:35.176
She's done.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:37.645
Yes?

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:42.317
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.585
Douchebag here thought

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.153
you were kidnapped by aliens.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:51.626
She is not okay.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.300
You were watching
her ass, right?

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.603
- What?
- I saw you.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:07.075
Melanie is done, you people
need to untie me now.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.910
Did you like watching her?

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:10.879
You just saw her, she's fine.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.913
She is not fine!

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:14.916
Cindy, go check on Mel.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:19.287
Jill, stop harassing
our new guest.

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.622
Guest?

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:21.622
You meant hostage.

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:24.626
Did his spooky alien
story get to you?

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:28.930
No, but he believes it
enough to piss his own pants.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:33.368
Jill, let me know if he watches
my ass too on the way out.

01:09:36.106 --> 01:09:37.805
Mel.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:41.609
Give me the scissors.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:42.844
Why?

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:49.716
Don't, he might do
something to us.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:52.754
No, I'm here to help you.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:56.090
Edgar, tell me again what
is it that you actually do?

01:09:56.092 --> 01:10:00.828
You know what I do
and now I have failed.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.532
Please, cut me loose now.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:13.007
Mel?

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:07.495
I'll go check on them.

01:11:19.676 --> 01:11:23.044
Please, cut me loose, please.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.081
- Cindy?
- Cut me loose.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:29.150
Melanie?

01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:31.486
Cut me loose, please,
please, please.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:33.621
- Shut up!
- Cut me loose.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:34.889
Shut up.

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:36.591
- Adrian.
- Melanie?

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:39.160
Adrian.

01:11:39.162 --> 01:11:42.630
Adrian , cut me loose.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:48.670
For the love of God, please.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.810
I'm sorry.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.948
Then you see, there
are multiple species.

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:38.152
It's all true, we're not
alone, they live among us.

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:39.954
They breed with us, they eat us.

01:12:39.956 --> 01:12:42.724
Literally thousands of
people go missing every year

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:46.861
with no explanation and no
one goes looking for them.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:50.098
I believe you now
but what can we do?

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.332
What are we supposed to do?

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:53.601
No one believes us, I
mean we have no proof.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:55.269
But don't you
have proof, though?

01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:57.572
I mean the chip
inside your tooth,

01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:59.173
haven't they taken x-rays of it?

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:01.809
I can hear them,
I can feel them.

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:05.012
I have a scar to prove
it, you saw what happened.

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:07.515
Advanced technology.

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.286
- Well maybe.
- No yeah, yeah.

01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:15.957
I mean we know
electricity exists, right?

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:16.991
But we can't see it.

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:19.527
How do I explain that I
can hear them in my mind?

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:21.295
- I can't.
- Wait, wait.

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:22.897
None of this was
happening until you two

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:26.701
showed up today and then she
came and showed us that video.

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:30.371
I mean you two are new
here, how do we explain,

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:31.906
is this supposed to
be a coincidence?

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.509
That is a discussion
for another day, Matt.

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:37.044
No, we need to discuss it now.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:40.982
- How do you explain it?
- I'm not sure.

01:13:40.984 --> 01:13:46.621
It all means something, I just
think that maybe we need to,

01:13:46.623 --> 01:13:47.889
we need to team together.

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:49.957
Why are you being so defensive?

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:51.192
I'm not being defensive, Matt.

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:52.994
I just think that now that
this group is becoming

01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:56.664
more known and we're getting
more people to join us

01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:01.769
and maybe these visions
that we all think we see,

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.304
they're just made up.

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:06.307
These are not made
up stories, John.

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:09.143
These are not just dreams, okay?

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:11.846
I have the scars to prove it.

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:14.348
Somebody here is
not being honest.

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:16.751
- Somebody's lying.
- This is not helping at all.

01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:20.888
Everybody calm down,
just calm down.

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:24.258
Take a five minute
breather, okay?

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.662
Everybody just, just take five.

01:14:58.428 --> 01:15:00.962
Is this what you saw?

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:02.296
Where did you find that?

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:05.399
Is this what you
were looking for?

01:15:05.401 --> 01:15:07.134
Where did you find that?

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:10.872
Harry should
have finished his mission.

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:12.673
What's going on here?

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.476
You should've let him
finish his mission.

01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:18.980
Now we will have to find
someone else who will.

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:25.119
They're here.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:27.021
I can hear them talking.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.756
I don't know what's going on.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:32.460
No, I feel terrible.

01:15:32.462 --> 01:15:34.629
They're here now.

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:39.667
Oh my god, Matt.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:41.402
We need to get outta here.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:43.304
You have a mission to complete.

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:47.408
