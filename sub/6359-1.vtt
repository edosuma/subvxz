02:21.474 --> 02:23.934

and James Melton plays...

02:24.018 --> 02:26.645
First he's a hotel
porter and then he becomes a radio singer

02:26.729 --> 02:28.647
and then he becomes an opera singer.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.691

You know the one

02:40.952 --> 02:42.911
Is he married? Are you crazy?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.372
Yes, he's married to Ginger Rogers.

02:45.415 --> 02:49.042
God. They got married
on a boat off the island of Catalina.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.837
They live in Beverly Hills
and sometimes holiday in Spain.

02:51.921 --> 02:55.549

to be married to Jack Culpepper,

says all you guys do all day is just

03:59.197 --> 04:02.699
pitch pennies
and make passes at the girls who walk by.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.493
Well, Harriet Rufus is a douche bag.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.669
There's an early show.

04:13.753 --> 04:14.962
- I can't, I can't.
- How come?

04:15.004 --> 04:17.130
- Well, the guys are coming over tonight.
- Again?

04:17.214 --> 04:18.757
What, you don't like it?

04:18.841 --> 04:22.803
Well, all you do is you drink and play dice,

04:22.845 --> 04:24.346
and I wind up getting smacked.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.348
Well, I got to get even, don't I?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.599
I owe everybody in town.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.852
You're never home anymore
except to play dice and cards.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.856
Meanwhile, I gotta take in extra laundry
after work to pay the rent.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.359
Well, what do you want?
Did I close the factory?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.027
You didn't used to be like this, Monk.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.696
Well, I got a lot on my mind.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.407
You think I like scratching around for work?

longer I can go on like this, you know.

will get back working again.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.665
- Things are bound to get better. I promise.
- Yeah.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.542
You know I'm crazy about you, huh?

04:53.584 --> 04:55.877
You never pay any attention to me anymore.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.547
That's why I thought
if we could go to the movies tonight,

04:58.589 --> 05:00.299
you know,
you could forget your troubles a little.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.425
Yeah, yeah, forget my troubles.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.928
Cecilia, you like
sitting through that junk, okay?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.180
- I'm gonna shoot crap, okay?
- Tsk.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.266

05:13.062 --> 05:14.229
And don't give me that look.

Come on, give us a hug, just one, come on.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.360

05:20.403 --> 05:23.822

21:11.103 --> 21:13.521
Oh, too bad nothing's open. I'm starved!

21:13.563 --> 21:14.939
- Oh, you are?
- Well, yeah,

21:15.023 --> 21:17.358
I, uh, left the movie
before the Copacabana scene.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.110
- So that's when I usually eat.
- Oh, wait a minute,

21:19.194 --> 21:21.570
what am I thinking?
Look, here, I've got a whole bag of popcorn.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.489
- You can have that.
- Oh, wow.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.491
Also, I have a Milky Way bar you might...

21:25.575 --> 21:28.160
- No, that's, popcorn is...
- You might want it later.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.579
Boy!

21:30.706 --> 21:32.707
So that's what popcorn tastes like.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.377
I've been watching
people eat it for all those performances.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.671
When they rattle
those bags, though, that's, uh...

21:38.714 --> 21:39.964
- That's not...
- ...kind of annoying.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.300
I still don't understand what's going on.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.884
I wanted to meet you.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.511
Don't tell me you
didn't see me looking at you

21:45.554 --> 21:47.179
just out of the corner of my eye.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.973
When Kitty Haynes
was doing her nightclub number?

21:49.057 --> 21:51.976
Oh, wait a minute,
I did, I remember seeing you kind of...

21:52.102 --> 21:53.936
You were looking
off to the side, somehow, but...

21:54.021 --> 21:56.272
- Sure.
- I never thought it was to me.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.899
Yeah, when we
take the drive to that little country inn?

21:58.942 --> 22:00.901
When I propose to Kitty?
I was looking at you.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.279
Oh, no, Kitty
looked so beautiful in that black dress.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.573
Oh, no, she's nothing compared to you.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.326
What are you talking about? I'm nothing.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.369
Like hell you are. You are fetching.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.455
- Fetching?
- Fetching.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.041
Dad liked to use that word
about Mom back in Chicago.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.418
"Man!" he'd say, "You're rather fetching."

22:17.502 --> 22:18.711
(GIGGLES)

22:19.713 --> 22:20.755
Dad was a card.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.090
I never met him.
He died before the movie begins.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.635
I have to confess.
My eye did always go to you

22:26.720 --> 22:29.930
- up on the screen. Really.
- Really?

22:30.682 --> 22:33.517
Even when I'm around Detective Sims
and Henry Adams, the playboy.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.103
Yes, even though
you're not the main character,

22:36.188 --> 22:37.646
you're the one you look at.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.982
You don't think I'm the main character.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.943
Oh, I didn't mean it that way. No!

22:43.028 --> 22:45.780
I think you were positively essential.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.282
In fact, every time
I saw the movie I kept thinking,

22:48.325 --> 22:50.284
"Tom Baxter's so handsome."

22:50.369 --> 22:51.369
(CHUCKLING)

22:56.291 --> 22:58.125
Shouldn't you be getting back?

22:58.168 --> 23:01.128
I want to live.
I want to be free to make my own choices.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.798
Right now,
the country's not in such great shape.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.385
- What do you mean?
- Well, we're in the middle of a depression.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.136
Everybody's very poor...

23:10.389 --> 23:12.473
I got plenty, look at this!

23:13.642 --> 23:17.353
But, they need you.
The story doesn't work without you.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.855
Cecilia, I'm in love with you.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.233
I'm married...

23:22.776 --> 23:24.151
Happily?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.738
I really should get back home.
I have to cook dinner.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.490
Just slip away from your husband tonight.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.158
Meet me here. I'll wait for you.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.786
I want to learn
about the real world with you.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.246
I can't.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.622
Well, look at it this way.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.166
How many times
is a man so taken with a woman

23:39.209 --> 23:41.210
that he walks off the screen to get her?

23:44.548 --> 23:47.091
<i>Okay, okay, let's not panic. We're all adults.</i>

23:47.175 --> 23:48.843
<i>Bored of sitting around.
I'm a dramatic character.</i>

23:48.885 --> 23:50.010
<i>I need forward motion.</i>

23:52.848 --> 23:54.473

23:54.516 --> 23:56.016
- HENRY: <i>Tom's gone.
- What?</i>

23:56.101 --> 23:57.685
<i>- He left the film.
- What?</i>

23:57.727 --> 23:59.270
<i>The bum walked out on us.</i>

23:59.354 --> 24:01.772
(STAMMERING) <i>But the Copa
is where the two of us meet.</i>

24:01.857 --> 24:03.232
<i>I'm trying to get him to marry me.</i>

24:03.316 --> 24:05.901
<i>Forget it. I'm tired
of marrying you every night anyway.</i>

24:05.986 --> 24:07.236
<i>We never even get to the bedroom.</i>

24:07.362 --> 24:09.864
<i>- Where did Tom go?
- Into the real world.</i>

24:09.948 --> 24:12.032
<i>That two-bit minor character
leaves and we're stuck.</i>

24:12.117 --> 24:13.784
<i>I wonder what it's like out there.</i>

24:13.869 --> 24:16.203
<i>They don't look like
they're having too much fun to me.</i>

24:16.580 --> 24:18.497
Hey, what the hell kind of movie is this?

24:18.540 --> 24:21.208
WOMAN: The paper said it was a romance,
set all over the world!

24:21.293 --> 24:24.211
<i>Look, don't tell us your sad stories.
You think we like this?</i>

24:24.254 --> 24:28.007
Look at this.
They sit around and talk, and no action?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.050
- Nothing happens?
- I want my money back.

24:30.093 --> 24:32.052
- This is outrageous!
<i>- Shh. Why don't you stop yapping?</i>

24:32.095 --> 24:33.387
<i>We've got problems of our own.</i>

24:33.430 --> 24:34.722
You can't talk to my wife like that.

Who do you think you are?

24:36.016 --> 24:38.184

24:50.322 --> 24:52.031
Oh, I'm not.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.241
There's too much pepper in the sauce.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.660

Are you, uh...

25:00.290 --> 25:03.792
I guess you and the guys
are probably going out again tonight, huh?

25:03.919 --> 25:06.879
No, I'm not. My back is acting up again.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.298
You gotta give me one
of your special rubdowns. I bought liniment.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.217
- Oh, no.
- What?

25:12.052 --> 25:13.552
Well, I can't.

25:15.388 --> 25:16.639
What do you mean, you can't?

25:16.765 --> 25:18.933
I'm sorry, I didn't mean I can't, I mean,

25:19.017 --> 25:20.601
(STAMMERING) I made some plans, I...

25:20.727 --> 25:22.311
You made plans?

25:22.437 --> 25:25.189
Well, I did. I said I'd...

25:25.273 --> 25:27.608
I'd baby-sit tonight.

25:27.651 --> 25:31.195
I... You know, I ran
into Mrs. Lorenzo and, in the...

25:31.279 --> 25:33.239
I'm saying in the restaurant,
in the street today...

25:33.281 --> 25:35.991
And she has some, you know, I don't know,

25:36.076 --> 25:39.453
I think it was social club meeting or
something she wanted to go to...

25:40.288 --> 25:41.789
Yeah, it won't be too long.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.458
- Yeah, well, I think it's a great idea.
- Yeah?

25:44.584 --> 25:47.336
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah, because we can use every penny.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.921
All right, so what am I going to do
about my back?

25:48.964 --> 25:51.006
Oh well, don't worry.
You know, I can do some now,

25:51.091 --> 25:52.925
and I'll do some when I come in...

25:52.968 --> 25:55.928
You shouldn't move around too much,
just kind of take it easy.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.972
Well, if you're
gonna go baby-sitting, get paid in cash.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.641
- I will. Okay.
- Don't let her owe you.

those socialites sitting around up there,

26:11.403 --> 26:13.320
and staring back at us,
making nasty remarks.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.738
Is that what they're doing now?

26:14.823 --> 26:16.824
Well, the last time I looked,
the priest had a deck of cards,

26:16.908 --> 26:18.450
and the men were playing pinochle.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.493
How did this first happen?

26:19.578 --> 26:21.954
Well, it's probably all the electrical
storms we had this evening.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.122
The air is charged.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.957
Look, fellas, I depend on the Jewel,

26:25.000 --> 26:28.377
I got personal expenses,
I've got no substitute picture to put in here.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.838
I want my money back! This is a swindle!

26:30.922 --> 26:33.716
There's no story. Mrs. Lupus likes a story.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.635
I still think you should
turn the projector off and shut down.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.345
This could be the work of Reds,
or anarchists.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.306
You can't do that.
If he turns off the projector,

26:40.348 --> 26:44.101
you're liable to strand
this Tom Baxter out in the world someplace.

You want an extra guy running around?

This is not what happens!

26:50.442 --> 26:52.067
You'll get your money back.

in the movie last week to happen this week,

perfectly with Donald?

- He has to be drawn out.
- I don't like to draw people out.

It's impossible.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.708

28:30.792 --> 28:32.126

30:04.928 --> 30:07.930
Mmm-hmm.
The <i>New York Times</i> said that I was...

30:08.056 --> 30:12.267
I had almost too smoldering a quality
to just play comedy.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.562
Would you play Lindbergh
the way you played Tom Baxter?

30:15.647 --> 30:16.980
Would I play... No, of course not.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.732
Tom was kind of a change of pace for me.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.776
He was from my earlier roles.

30:20.860 --> 30:27.241
I played Tom Baxter with a kind of a
poetic, idealistic quality that, uh...

30:27.283 --> 30:31.245
Just... Lindbergh was a loner.
He was just self-reliant.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.664
I'd have to work
it out with my dialogue coach.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.374
He's a genius. He'll...

30:35.416 --> 30:36.917
Gil, can I see you for a minute?
Alone, please?

30:37.001 --> 30:38.335
- Would you excuse me? I'm sorry.
- Sure.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.128
- Right over here.
- What's up?

30:40.213 --> 30:43.340
Tom Baxter's come down off the screen,
and he's running around New Jersey.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.592
- What are you talking about?
- I just spoke to Raoul Hirsch.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.219
Nobody knows how it happened.
But he's done it.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.388
How could he do that?
It's not physically possible.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.931
In New Jersey anything can happen.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.391
But I created the character.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.851
That's my point.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.520
As your agent, I would hate to see
anything happen to your career,

30:56.604 --> 30:57.896
now that it is starting to move.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.189
- What, like, like, like what?
- Who knows?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.732
There's a double of you on the loose.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.402
What's he up to?
Is he robbing banks? Is he raping broads?

31:03.444 --> 31:05.195
- But, is he?
- Who knows?

31:06.030 --> 31:07.364
Look, the last thing we need

31:07.448 --> 31:09.533
- is for you to get a...
- Shh.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.327
The last thing we need
is for you to get a reputation

31:12.412 --> 31:14.496
- as somehow difficult.
- But I'm not, it's not my fault!

31:14.581 --> 31:18.125
Raoul Hirsch already said,
if you can't control your own creation,

31:18.167 --> 31:19.960
- nobody's going to risk a picture on you.
- Oh, my God!

31:20.003 --> 31:22.045
There goes...
I mean, I worked so hard to make him real.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.547
- Yeah, well, maybe you overdid it.
- Jeez!

31:23.631 --> 31:25.007
- I'll sue my dialogue coach, that louse.
- Look,

31:25.091 --> 31:27.217
you've got to fly down there
and check into this, quick.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.636
Right now, it's only one movie house,
but who knows?

31:29.679 --> 31:31.471
I can't, I'm afraid to fly.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.516
Gil, this is the scandal of all time.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.603
You know what happened
to Fatty Arbuckle's career?

31:37.645 --> 31:39.605
- I'll fly. I'll fly.
- Good.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.983
This is how they drink champagne in Cairo.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.361
I never had champagne before.

31:46.487 --> 31:49.323
- I feel... It makes me feel silly.
- It's supposed to.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.657
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.950
The check, as you requested, sir.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.201
Ah.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.287
Ah! It's so much!

31:55.330 --> 31:57.122
- Oh...
- I hope found it to your liking, sir.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.499
- It was superb.
- Oh, it was. It was wonderful.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.710
My compliments to the chef.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.463
And, uh, keep 20% for yourself.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.257
No, make that 30%.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.967
Yes, quite amusing.

32:09.844 --> 32:12.012
- What is?
- The fake money.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.348
Fake money?

32:14.432 --> 32:17.059
Is it, uh, play money, sir, or stage money?

32:19.062 --> 32:22.022
Keep 30% for yourself,
and stop looking so serious.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.858
I'll get the Maitre D'.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.986
Tom, that's not real money.

32:28.529 --> 32:31.490
Well, what do you mean it's not real money?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.367
Oh, my God.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.328
Uh, do you have any money?

32:36.371 --> 32:38.372
No. What are we going to do?

32:39.082 --> 32:40.624
We're going to have to make a run for it.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.877
No, I can't run.
My ankles are bad from waitressing.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.046
Just get up. Follow me.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.104
TOM: Quick, get in the car.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.858
Tom, this is not our car!

33:06.901 --> 33:08.527
We don't have a car. We came by foot.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.445
- It doesn't go.
- Well, of course, it doesn't go.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.655
There's no key.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.031
I just, hey, I don't understand.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.616
- This is how I always go in the movie.
- Oh, Tom,

33:14.701 --> 33:16.994
this is real life.
They don't start without a key!

33:17.078 --> 33:18.829
- They don't? Let's go.
- No!

33:18.913 --> 33:20.580
- Hey, you two, get back here!
- They're leaving.

33:20.623 --> 33:21.832
You can't run out on these checks.

33:21.916 --> 33:23.083
They're a couple of deadbeats.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.668
Get back here, right now!

33:28.089 --> 33:29.965
TOM: I'm sorry about the money.
I had no idea.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.842
CECILIA: Oh, that's okay.

33:31.926 --> 33:35.137
It's not going to be so easy
to get along without it in this world.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.347
TOM: Oh, I guess I have to get a job.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.974
But that's not going to be so easy, either.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.934
Right now, the whole country's out of work.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.936
Well, then we'll live on love.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.105
We'll have to make some concessions,
but so what?

33:45.189 --> 33:47.649
- We'll have each other.
- That's movie talk.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.235
You look so beautiful in this light.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.945
But you're not real.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.874
Was that real enough for you?

34:05.168 --> 34:08.795
You kiss perfectly.
It's what I dreamed kissing would be like.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.880
Come away with me to Cairo.

34:10.965 --> 34:11.965
Cairo?

34:12.007 --> 34:15.677
We'll live in the desert.
It will... Oh, the blue-gold light of sunset

34:15.762 --> 34:17.596
- falling over your hair and the...
- Look, I'm sorry.

34:17.638 --> 34:20.806
I'm a little tipsy. I... From the...

34:30.318 --> 34:32.652
- Where's the fade out?
- What?

34:33.237 --> 34:36.322
Always when the kissing gets hot and
heavy, just before the love-making,

34:36.364 --> 34:37.866
there's a fade out.

34:37.949 --> 34:39.868
Oh, then what?

34:39.952 --> 34:43.538
Then, then we're making love
in some private, perfect place.

34:43.623 --> 34:47.333
Oh, that's not how it happens here.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.337
- What, there's no fade out?
- No...

34:50.838 --> 34:54.424
But when you kissed me,
I felt like my heart faded out,

34:54.509 --> 34:59.262
and I closed my eyes
and I was in some, some private place.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.807
How fascinating.

35:01.849 --> 35:04.101
You make love without fading out?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.769
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)
- Yes.

35:06.729 --> 35:08.855
Well, I can't wait to see this.

35:09.982 --> 35:12.651
Listen, I can't...

35:12.693 --> 35:14.861
I'm not that kind of girl.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.613
I'm married.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.367
Cecilia,

35:20.451 --> 35:23.411
it's clear how miserable
you are with your husband,

35:25.248 --> 35:28.708
and if he hits you again, you tell me.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.211
I'd be forced to knock his teeth out.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.338
I don't think that would be such a good idea.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.798
He's big.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.842
Well, I'm sorry.
It's written into my character to do it,

35:36.884 --> 35:38.051
so I do it.

35:39.053 --> 35:42.514
Listen, I think I better go home now.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.057
- It's late.
- Okay.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.517
It's been a whirlwind of a day.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.726
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.228
What are you gonna do?

35:48.938 --> 35:51.273
Um, I'll just... I'll sleep here at the carousel.

35:51.357 --> 35:54.568
And walk around, drink in the night air.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.113
Enjoy my freedom, and dream of you.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.499
You got in late last night.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.710
Oh, yeah, you were out like a light.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.753
I took a hot bath to relax me.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.589
You want to get me a cup of coffee?

36:15.631 --> 36:17.257
Oh, yeah, sure.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.093
There was some big
deal going on over at the movie house.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.928
A big crowd when I went to buy cigarettes.

36:21.971 --> 36:24.097
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I couldn't get the story straight.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.933
There's some guy
who ran out the side exit with a customer.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.811
- Who?
- Oh, a woman, a guy, uh, an actor.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.563
I don't know what
the hell the cop was talking about.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.606
He didn't know.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.400
Well, they don't know who the woman was?

36:35.443 --> 36:37.903
Some woman dragged out in the dark.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.030
They got those real geronimos
at the movie houses.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.282
See, that's why
I don't like you staying out so late at night.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.909
(STAMMERING) I know. I couldn't help it.

36:43.951 --> 36:46.161
The Lorenzos didn't get back till late.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.287
I couldn't leave.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.623
- Well, I hope you got paid overtime.
- Oh, sure.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.958
Oh, good, good. Let's have it.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.628
(STUTTERING) They, uh...
They didn't have any cash.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.796
I'll have to come back for it later today.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.257
Cecilia, I told you
to get paid, uh, in cash, didn't I?

36:59.300 --> 37:02.636
Well, I know, but all they had was big bills,

37:02.762 --> 37:04.137
and, um, you know, I was getting late,

37:04.222 --> 37:05.222
- so I thought I better leave.
- Yeah, well,

37:05.306 --> 37:07.057
- they're going to fork it over today, right?
- Oh, they will.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.141
Yeah, yeah, sure.

37:08.184 --> 37:12.270
Leave something to you,
you can bet you're going to get fouled up.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.986
You have no idea where he went?

37:20.279 --> 37:22.489
<i>Mr. Hirsch, this is awful for us.</i>

37:22.615 --> 37:23.907
<i>- Really difficult.</i>
- Think of me,

37:23.991 --> 37:25.742
my reputation, my career!

37:25.826 --> 37:27.786
First thing we've gotta do,
is we gotta keep it contained.

37:27.828 --> 37:28.995
- Yeah.
- The word's out already.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.163
We gotta keep the crisis local.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.624
I know the two reporters in town.
They're old friends.

37:32.667 --> 37:33.667
- Maybe I could talk to them.
- Fine,

37:33.751 --> 37:36.002
a couple of bucks
spread around town will buy us some time.

37:36.045 --> 37:37.212
Don't worry about a thing...

37:37.296 --> 37:39.464
<i>I mean, we're all so lost.</i>

37:39.507 --> 37:40.548
HIRSCH: I know it's rough.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.384
I just want the whole cast to know

37:42.468 --> 37:45.262
how much I appreciate
your staying up there on the screen.

37:45.346 --> 37:48.014
I hope you're not
going to hold this against me, R.H.

37:48.057 --> 37:50.475
You created the part of Tom Baxter, Gil.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.768
The facts are undeniable.

37:51.852 --> 37:54.437
<i>I want to go too.
I want to be free! I want out!</i>

37:54.522 --> 37:56.648
I'm warning you, that's Communist talk!

37:56.691 --> 37:58.316
We're gonna
have to pull the film out of the theater

37:58.359 --> 38:00.277
and you're going
to have to make good my receipts.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.028
<i>You mean, you're thinking of pulling the film</i>

38:02.071 --> 38:03.446
<i>because a minor character is missing?</i>

38:03.531 --> 38:05.448
A minor character? Would you listen to her?

38:05.533 --> 38:07.826
You know, he may not have the most lines,

38:07.868 --> 38:09.411
but the plot turns on Baxter.

38:09.495 --> 38:12.289
I deliberately played him
with a cheerful bravado.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.832
<i>Who cares how you played him?</i>

38:13.874 --> 38:14.916
<i>- He's minor.
- That's right.</i>

38:15.001 --> 38:16.376
I would just like to get my hands on him.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.044
Right when my career was taking off.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.046
<i>He could be raping
that woman he abducted.</i>

38:20.089 --> 38:22.966
And he's got my fingerprints,
my exact prints!

38:23.050 --> 38:25.719
<i>You know what
they get for rape in a small town,</i>

38:25.761 --> 38:27.846
<i>especially by a man in a pith helmet?</i>

38:27.888 --> 38:30.682
If this is the start of a new trend,
our industry's as good as dead.

38:30.725 --> 38:34.728
The real ones want their lives fiction,
and the fictional ones want their lives real.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.396
Does anybody know who that woman was?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.565
No. It was all so crazy, nobody noticed.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.110
Just two doughnuts
and a container of coffee to go, please.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.237
GIL: Right now, it's chaos.

38:45.072 --> 38:47.532
Well, how can rumors
be circulating at the Brown Derby?

38:47.575 --> 38:50.035
It just happened! Well, squash it, Herbie,

38:50.077 --> 38:51.786
I got a career on the line.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.540
Look, I'll call you the minute I hear.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.044
Oh, excuse me.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.420
(GASPING) What are you doing here?

39:00.463 --> 39:03.006
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't have a pencil,
or I'd give you an autograph.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.091
Where did you get those clothes?

39:05.134 --> 39:07.844
- Pardon me?
- Your clothes, where did you get them?

39:07.928 --> 39:10.263
Uh, a little store on Sunset and Vine.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.890
What are you talking about?

39:11.932 --> 39:13.683
What are you talking about?

39:13.768 --> 39:14.934
Excuse me.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.937
I just bought you these. Two doughnuts.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.774
- For me? Well, thank you very much.
- Yeah. A container of coffee.

39:20.816 --> 39:21.941
I hope you enjoy my next movie.

39:22.026 --> 39:25.070
But, do you, I thought
you were going to stay hidden at the park.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.446
What park?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.864
Tom, what's the matter with you?

39:27.948 --> 39:31.117
- You're acting so peculiar.
- Tom? No, no. I'm...

39:31.535 --> 39:33.995
Wait a minute! Come here.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.414
What's come over you?

39:36.457 --> 39:38.291
I'm not Tom. I'm Gil Shepherd.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.001
- I play Tom.
- What?

39:40.086 --> 39:41.920
- How do you know Tom?
- You're Gil...

39:42.046 --> 39:44.255
- Oh, my God. I don't believe it.
- Yeah.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.966
You're Gil... I've seen you in lots of movies.

39:47.051 --> 39:50.136
- Look, where's Tom?
- Oh! <i>Broadway Bachelors,</i> right? Right?

39:50.221 --> 39:52.722
- Yeah, yeah, well, you know...
<i>- Honeymoon in Haiti?</i>

39:52.807 --> 39:54.516
- Done about six.
- You were a scream.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.267
- Well, thank you.
- (EXCLAIMING)

39:56.310 --> 39:57.894
Thank you very much. That's...

39:57.978 --> 40:00.146
I try to do one a year,
you know, just to keep...

40:00.189 --> 40:02.649
Where's Tom?

40:02.733 --> 40:03.942
Why?

40:03.984 --> 40:06.194
Well, he's my character. I created him.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.405
Well, didn't the man
who wrote the movie do that?

40:08.489 --> 40:10.657
Yes, technically.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.784
But I made him live. I fleshed him out.

40:12.827 --> 40:16.579
But you did...
You did a wonderful job. He's adorable.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.790
(CHUCKLING) Thank you very much.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.167
(SIGHING) What's your name?

40:21.293 --> 40:22.710
Cecilia.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.087
Cecilia.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.338
(GASPING)

40:25.506 --> 40:26.673
Where is he?

40:26.757 --> 40:29.592
- Why?
- Has he done anything wrong?

40:29.677 --> 40:30.760
Wrong, like what?

40:30.845 --> 40:33.972
Has he stolen anything
or attacked any females? You?

40:34.014 --> 40:37.517
No, gosh, no, no, he's as sweet as can be.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.811
Well, I played him sweet.
I was well reviewed.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.354
Well, it comes across.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.940
Good. Look, I gotta speak to him.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.650
You're not upset with him?

40:45.693 --> 40:47.152
Well, a little, yes,

40:47.194 --> 40:49.612
but I know if I spoke to him,
we could straighten everything out.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.322
Oh, I don't know.

40:51.365 --> 40:53.366
Please, I have a right.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.743
Well, it has to be secret.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.204
He doesn't want to have
to go back into the movie.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.082
- He doesn't?
- No, he loves being free.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.918
- He's having the time of his life.
- Oh, my God.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.880
Would you take me to him? Trust me.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.174
Please.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.136
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

41:20.227 --> 41:25.023
Monk, somebody saw your wife last night
at the Dine and Dance Joint.

41:25.065 --> 41:27.150
Oh, sure, she's there every night
with the Rockefellers.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.319
Uh, she was with this crazy-looking guy

41:29.403 --> 41:31.905
- wearing an explorer's hat and britches.
- Come on.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.364
Britches?

41:33.407 --> 41:36.242
You know, you're nuts.
She was baby-sitting.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.078
Right. I guess you know it all.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.251
All right, who's next?

41:53.469 --> 41:57.138
(SOFTLY) Tom? Tom?

41:59.058 --> 42:02.936
- Cecilia, I dreamed of us in Cairo.
- Tom. Tom...

42:03.604 --> 42:05.897
- I brought Gil Shepherd.
- Gil... Gil Shepherd.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.107
- I play you in the movie.
- You do?

42:08.192 --> 42:10.235
How dare you run away!

42:10.277 --> 42:11.736
This is disconcerting.

42:11.779 --> 42:14.614
Oh, I'll show you
the meaning of disconcerting.

42:14.657 --> 42:15.949
I'm trying to build a career!

42:16.033 --> 42:17.992
Yeah, well,
I don't want to be in the film anymore.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.327
I'm in love with Cecilia.

42:19.411 --> 42:21.496
Mr. Shepherd, you said you weren't angry.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.373
You can't do this to me. It's my best role.

42:23.457 --> 42:25.083
I've been critically acclaimed for this.
It's my very...

42:25.125 --> 42:26.709
I'd say it's because of the way I do it.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.754
No, no, no, because of the way I do it.
I'm doing it, not you.

42:29.797 --> 42:32.465
It's me, not him. I mean, isn't that obvious?

42:32.508 --> 42:34.300
Well, then, how do you
explain that here I am?

42:34.426 --> 42:36.010
Well, because
I took you from the printed page,

42:36.095 --> 42:37.887
and I made you live.
I fleshed you out, just like...

42:37.972 --> 42:40.890
- So, I'm living.
- Yes, but for the screen only, please.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.642
- And as soon...
- I want my freedom.

42:42.726 --> 42:44.644
I don't want another one of me
running around the world.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.312
I mean, I can
just imagine what he's been up...

42:46.355 --> 42:48.106
Why? Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?

42:48.148 --> 42:49.482
Yes. Frankly, I am afraid...

42:49.525 --> 42:50.692
But, you created me.

42:50.776 --> 42:52.610
All right, look, be reasonable here.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.737
I'm starting to build a career.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.614
Is life up on the screen so terrible that you...

42:56.657 --> 42:59.617
I want to be with Cecilia.
I'm in love with her.

43:00.786 --> 43:01.953
Will you tell him to go back?

43:01.996 --> 43:03.746
Tell him that you don't love him.

43:03.831 --> 43:04.914
Tell him you can't love him.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.082
He's fictional!

43:06.166 --> 43:08.334
You want to waste your time
with a fictional character?

43:08.419 --> 43:10.670
I mean, you're a sweet girl.
You deserve an actual human.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.422
But Tom's perfect.

43:12.506 --> 43:13.798
Yeah, but he's not real.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.718
What good is perfect if the man's not real?

43:16.802 --> 43:18.428
I can learn to be real.

43:18.512 --> 43:20.305
It's easy. You know, there's nothing to it.

43:20.347 --> 43:22.098
Being real comes very naturally to me.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.434
Can't learn to be real.
It's like learning to be a midget.

43:24.518 --> 43:25.852
It's not a thing you can learn.

43:25.894 --> 43:27.937
Some of us are real, some are not.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.315
I say I can do it.

43:30.357 --> 43:31.941
I'm not going to stay here
and argue with you.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.192
I'm gonna go back to town.

43:33.277 --> 43:36.362
I'm going to call my attorney,
the Actors' Union.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.615
I won't take this lying down.

43:38.699 --> 43:42.577
Nor will Raoul Hirsch, nor the police,

43:42.661 --> 43:44.662
nor the FBI.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.166
Yes, yes, we found him.

43:48.834 --> 43:50.209
Gil Shepherd found him,

43:50.294 --> 43:52.587
but he refuses to get back on the screen.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.672
R.H. is very upset.

43:54.715 --> 43:58.176
No, no, we can't force him. It's not a crime.

43:58.218 --> 44:00.053
We need a plan.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.888
Yeah, the press is on our side.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.599
It took a few bucks,
but they're going to keep it quiet for now.

44:04.683 --> 44:07.352
Uh, what? Really?

44:09.104 --> 44:11.773
The Tom Baxter character
in a movie house in Chicago

44:11.857 --> 44:13.900
has been forgetting his lines.

44:13.942 --> 44:16.361
I just got a call from the manager.

44:16.403 --> 44:18.946
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the bathroom.

44:19.031 --> 44:20.907
On the floor, weeping.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.663
I mean, you do...
Aren't you at all even worried?

44:26.747 --> 44:29.248
Well, what about
Raoul Hirsch and what, the FBI?

44:29.333 --> 44:31.417
No, Cecilia,
if I can be with you, I'm never going back.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.002
- But I, you know...
- No more buts.

44:33.087 --> 44:35.213
I said I was going
to learn about the real world with you.

44:35.255 --> 44:36.506
Show me.

44:40.594 --> 44:42.887
(INAUDIBLE)

45:19.842 --> 45:23.720
TOM: It's beautiful.
But I'm not sure exactly what it is.

45:23.804 --> 45:28.099
Oh, this is a church.
You do believe in God, don't you?

45:28.142 --> 45:29.976
Meaning?

45:30.060 --> 45:35.732
Mmm, the reason for everything,
the, the world, the universe...

45:35.816 --> 45:36.816
Oh, I think I know what you mean.

45:36.900 --> 45:39.152
The two men who wrote, uh,
<i>The Purple Rose of Cairo.</i>

45:39.236 --> 45:42.155
Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine,
the writers who collaborate on films.

45:42.239 --> 45:45.491
No, no, I'm talking
about something much bigger than that.

45:45.534 --> 45:49.203
No, think for a minute.
A reason for everything.

45:49.288 --> 45:52.498
Otherwise, it'd be
like a movie with no point,

45:52.583 --> 45:53.833
and no happy ending.

45:53.876 --> 45:55.501
So there you are!

45:56.128 --> 45:57.628
I'm looking for you.

45:57.671 --> 45:59.714
Monk, I, um...

46:01.091 --> 46:04.761
This is my husband. This is Tom Baxter.

46:04.845 --> 46:07.972
Adventurer, explorer, the Chicago Baxters.
I'm charmed to meet you.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.141
So you wear the britches.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.768
CECILIA: What did you want
to talk to me about?

46:11.852 --> 46:14.604
I heard you were out on the town last night.

46:14.688 --> 46:18.024
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I admit I didn't tell the truth about that,

46:18.066 --> 46:21.027
but things have
been so strange the last 24 hours...

46:21.069 --> 46:22.403
You know what I told you I'd do to you

46:22.488 --> 46:23.780
- if you ever lied to me?
- Monk, don't hit me.

46:23.864 --> 46:25.948
Obviously, your marriage
has come to an impasse, sir.

46:26.033 --> 46:27.533
And you keep out of this.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.827
- Monk, let's just talk.
- No, you're coming home with me!

46:29.870 --> 46:31.412
- Can't we talk?
- Perhaps you don't understand, sir,

46:31.497 --> 46:32.538
but I'm in love with your wife.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.123
Close your yap, jackass.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.208
Now let's go. You're in for a lesson...

46:35.292 --> 46:37.210
You're failing to understand, sir.

46:37.294 --> 46:38.377
She's not coming with you.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.630
- Oh, she's not, huh?
- No, you take your hands off.

46:40.714 --> 46:42.715
No man will hit the woman I love,
nor any woman.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.219
- Beat it! Beat it. I'm gonna take you apart!
- Stop it!

46:46.261 --> 46:48.012
- He's got a terrible temper.
- And you, go home.

46:48.055 --> 46:51.307
Sorry, it's written into my character.
Courage.

46:51.391 --> 46:52.600
Stop it!

47:00.692 --> 47:03.194
- Come on.
- Stop it! What are you doing?

47:15.082 --> 47:16.415
Time for the old one-two.

47:16.458 --> 47:18.000
(GRUNTING)

47:19.795 --> 47:21.587
Hope he's had enough.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.298
Sorry, pal. Sorry about the rough stuff.

47:24.383 --> 47:25.508
- You all right?
- Yeah.

47:25.592 --> 47:26.926
Let me give you a hand. There's a...

47:26.969 --> 47:30.429
(GRUNTING) God, it's not fair. Oh!

47:34.476 --> 47:36.853
Tom! What are you doing?

47:37.396 --> 47:39.564
- You're coming home with me now.
- No, I'm not!

47:39.606 --> 47:40.606
What'd you say?

47:40.691 --> 47:42.650
No, I'm going to stay
and see that Tom's okay.

47:42.734 --> 47:43.943
- I...
- You're a bully, Monk.

47:43.986 --> 47:44.986
I gave you an order.

47:45.070 --> 47:46.863
I don't care. I'm tired of taking your orders.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.072
You could've killed him.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.658
All right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

47:50.742 --> 47:51.742
- I hit hard.
- You can't just...

47:51.785 --> 47:53.995
You can't just
go through life beating people up.

47:54.079 --> 47:56.080
Look, I'm telling you one more time.
Are you coming with me?

47:56.123 --> 47:57.540
No, I'm not.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.376
I'm telling you one more time. You coming?

48:00.460 --> 48:02.795
- No! No, I'm not!
- Come on!

48:04.798 --> 48:07.633
The hell with it. I need a beer anyway.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.468
I'll see you later.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.056
Oh, are you okay?

48:14.141 --> 48:16.475
Oh, oh, yeah. I'm fine.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.727
You're not even marked.

48:17.811 --> 48:19.645
Your hair is in place.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.480
No, no. I don't get hurt or bleed.

48:21.523 --> 48:22.607
Hair doesn't muss.

48:22.649 --> 48:24.817
It's one of the advantages
of being imaginary.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.569
- (CHUCKLES)
- You were very brave.

48:26.653 --> 48:30.406
Yeah, well, I had him, too,
till he started fighting dirty.

48:30.490 --> 48:33.534
That's why you'll never
survive off the screen.

48:33.619 --> 48:36.996
You were pretty brave, too.
You stood right up to him.

48:37.039 --> 48:38.664
You inspired me.

48:51.845 --> 48:53.596
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

48:54.806 --> 48:56.015
CECILIA: Mr. Shepherd.

48:56.099 --> 48:59.185
Oh, Cecilia, look, I got to speak to you.

48:59.227 --> 49:01.979
Oh, listen, I've had a crazy morning.

49:02.022 --> 49:04.273
- I'm still shaking.
- Look, I don't know what to do, all right?

49:04.358 --> 49:05.775
I've struggled my whole life.

49:05.859 --> 49:08.069
And now I'm
finally beginning to break through

49:08.153 --> 49:09.946
and my whole career's
going right down the drain.

49:10.030 --> 49:12.490
You don't have to worry about that.

49:12.532 --> 49:15.368
You'll always be a great movie star.

49:15.452 --> 49:20.122
Oh, well, that's very nice of you to say,
but technically, I'm not really a star yet.

49:20.207 --> 49:24.251
(CHUCKLING) Cecilia, you know, I mean,
I try to carry myself like one.

49:24.336 --> 49:27.338
You know, I do the best I can
as far as that, but star?

49:27.381 --> 49:30.091
Phew! That's a big word, isn't it? Star?

49:30.717 --> 49:32.969
Yeah, uh, no, no.

49:33.053 --> 49:34.428
No, star, no, no.

49:34.513 --> 49:39.100
And you're not just a pretty face,
you're also a peach of an actor.

49:39.184 --> 49:41.686
Really, I've seen you. I've seen you a lot.

49:41.728 --> 49:43.562
You've got something.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.564
- Is that your opinion?
- Sure.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.400
And I see all the movies.

49:47.484 --> 49:51.153
You've got, oh, how can I describe it?

49:53.073 --> 49:55.241
You've got a magical glow.

49:55.325 --> 49:57.743
(CHUCKLING) Oh, boy. Oh, oh.

49:57.828 --> 50:01.414
To hear that from a real person,
that is just...

50:01.456 --> 50:03.165
(EXHALING) It's not
one of those movie colony bimbos,

50:03.250 --> 50:06.711
you know, with the fancy dresses,
filling you full of hot air.

50:06.753 --> 50:08.629
Would you get over here
and sit down, please?

50:08.714 --> 50:10.881
Oh, you know, you can take it from me.

50:10.924 --> 50:12.425
You're not just a flash in the pan.

50:12.509 --> 50:15.928
No, you know, it'd be very easy
for me to trade on my looks.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.054
- Just, like that.
- Oh, sure.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.764
But I have some serious acting ambitions.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.933
You should. You should.

50:21.018 --> 50:24.270
You, you know...
I think you're great in all the funny movies.

50:24.354 --> 50:25.604
Thank you.

50:25.689 --> 50:26.814
Really, I was thinking you should,

50:26.898 --> 50:29.316
you should
play some of the more heroic parts.

50:29.401 --> 50:30.401
I want...

50:30.444 --> 50:32.153
- I tell my agent that a hundred times!
- Yeah?

50:32.237 --> 50:35.114
Well, you know, well, you could play...

50:35.157 --> 50:37.783
You could play,
like, Daniel Boone, or someone...

50:37.868 --> 50:39.535
- Lindbergh! Oh...
- Oh!

50:39.619 --> 50:41.412
- You'd be wonderful as Lindbergh.
- My God!

50:41.455 --> 50:43.456
- You are a mind reader.
- We had the same thought?

50:43.498 --> 50:46.208
- Really?
- I am on the verge of signing for that part.

50:46.293 --> 50:48.627
- No! Really?
- I'm, I am! I can taste it.

50:48.670 --> 50:50.504
Oh, you'll be wonderful.

50:50.589 --> 50:53.132
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, there's something inside you that...

50:53.175 --> 50:56.510
You have that
same kind of lone heroic quality.

50:56.595 --> 50:59.138
You're exactly right.
Everyone has been telling me not to...

50:59.222 --> 51:00.598
- You are right.
- Don't you listen.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.975
Basically, I have been a loner my entire life.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.643
Well, sure, anyone can see that.

51:04.686 --> 51:07.772
You know, you're deep
and probably complicated.

51:08.690 --> 51:10.149
Can I buy you lunch?

51:10.233 --> 51:11.609
- Me?
- Please. Can I?

51:11.651 --> 51:12.818
Please. Look, I love... I love talking to you.

51:12.861 --> 51:13.986
Oh, uh, I was just going to go upstairs...

51:14.071 --> 51:15.821
- Don't, no, really, come on...
- Really?

51:15.864 --> 51:18.324
- I open myself up around you...
- Oh...

51:18.366 --> 51:19.825
Have you ever been to Hollywood?

51:19.868 --> 51:21.243
Uh, come on, no, of course not.

51:21.328 --> 51:23.871
You, well, I would
love to just take you around Hollywood.

51:23.955 --> 51:25.331
- I would real...
- Oh.

51:25.415 --> 51:26.999
- Could I make a confession?
- Sure.

51:27.042 --> 51:29.210
Look, my real name, it's not Gil Shepherd.

51:29.294 --> 51:31.629
- It's Herman Bardebedian.
- Really?

51:31.671 --> 51:35.132
I've, yeah, I've been a cab driver for about...

51:35.175 --> 51:37.968
- Boy, do you have a pretty face.
- Come on.

51:38.011 --> 51:39.678
- You do!
- Oh.

51:54.861 --> 51:56.529
EMMA: Hi, big boy.

51:58.573 --> 52:00.324
You alone?

52:00.367 --> 52:01.700
Oh, hello.

52:02.119 --> 52:06.664
Uh, well, I'm alone for now,
but later I have an appointment,

52:06.706 --> 52:08.833
or should I say rendezvous?

52:09.543 --> 52:11.001
Good for you.

52:11.711 --> 52:14.046
Where did you get the funny suit?

52:14.714 --> 52:16.882
- What, this?
- Yeah.

52:17.717 --> 52:19.718
You coming from a costume party?

52:19.803 --> 52:21.137
(LAUGHING)

52:21.805 --> 52:25.141
No, no, I'm Tom Baxter
of the Chicago Baxters.

52:25.225 --> 52:27.935
Explorer, poet, adventurer.
Just back from Cairo

52:28.019 --> 52:31.438
where I searched
in vain for the legendary purple rose.

52:32.232 --> 52:33.774
How about that?

52:34.192 --> 52:35.693
Well, uh, who are you?

52:35.735 --> 52:38.237
- My name's Emma.
- Oh, that's lovely.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.822
What do you do, Emma?

52:39.906 --> 52:41.574
I'm a working girl.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.993
And what do you do, you delicate creature?

52:44.077 --> 52:46.787
(CHUCKLING) Anything that'll make a buck.

52:47.706 --> 52:51.083
Well, we Baxters
never really had to worry about money.

52:51.168 --> 52:54.128
I'll bet. You want to come along with me?

52:54.796 --> 52:56.422
Where to, Emma?

52:56.506 --> 52:59.675
Where I work.
I think you might have a good time.

53:00.677 --> 53:03.846
Sounds enchanting.
I'm up for new experiences.

53:03.930 --> 53:05.431
I may be able to help.

53:08.226 --> 53:09.935
EMMA: Hi, girls. This is Tom.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.187
Hi there, ladies.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.771
Don't you all look enticing?

53:12.856 --> 53:14.523
I know what you want.

53:14.608 --> 53:17.776
You want to be the great white hunter
and you want me to be the tiger.

53:17.861 --> 53:21.071
(CHUCKLING) Uh, I don't get it.

53:21.114 --> 53:22.740
You will if you can afford it.

53:22.782 --> 53:24.617
I met Tom out at the amusement park.

53:24.659 --> 53:26.702
Oh, no, that's, uh, my hat.

53:27.787 --> 53:30.497
Uh, yes, I was, uh...
I was thinking about something.

53:30.582 --> 53:33.459
- I can imagine.
- Two of us at the same time?

53:33.543 --> 53:35.461
You know, I was
thinking about some very deep things.

53:35.545 --> 53:39.298
About God and his relation
with Irving Sachs and R.H. Levine.

53:39.341 --> 53:41.967
And, I was thinking about life in general.

53:42.052 --> 53:44.303
The... The origin
of everything we see about us.

53:44.387 --> 53:47.973
The, uh... The finality
of death and how almost magical

53:48.058 --> 53:51.518
it seems in the... In the real world as, uh...
As opposed to the world of

53:51.603 --> 53:53.479
celluloid and flickering shadows.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.272
Where did you find this clown?

53:55.315 --> 53:57.483
For example, the miracle of birth.

53:57.525 --> 53:59.777
Now. I suppose
some of you lovely ladies are married.

53:59.819 --> 54:01.570
- Not anymore.
- No?

54:02.447 --> 54:07.243
Then, the absolutely
astonishing miracle of childbirth

54:07.327 --> 54:10.621
with all its attendant feelings
of humanity and pathos.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.331
I stand in awe of existence.

54:12.415 --> 54:15.626
- Do you want to tie me up?
- Tie you up?

54:15.669 --> 54:17.002
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

54:17.087 --> 54:20.422
(LAUGHING) Oh, that's very funny.
She's very funny.

54:20.507 --> 54:23.300
That's a nice sense of humor.
The absurd non sequitur.

54:23.343 --> 54:25.344
- What... What's your name, sweetheart?
- Martha.

54:25.428 --> 54:27.638
That's the same name
as the Ambassador's wife.

54:27.681 --> 54:30.015
Well, why didn't you
bring the Ambassador by?

54:30.058 --> 54:31.850
Well, he... He's still up on the screen.

54:31.893 --> 54:36.021
But, do you share my sense of wonderment
at the very fabric of being?

54:36.106 --> 54:40.067
The smell of a rose,
real food, sensuous music.

54:40.151 --> 54:42.027
I've got a child.

54:42.112 --> 54:43.195
- You do?
- Mmm.

54:43.238 --> 54:45.948
Oh, I see. You're a widow.
Uh, oh, poor thing.

54:46.032 --> 54:48.492
I got two kids and he's
right about giving birth.

54:48.535 --> 54:51.036
It is a beautiful experience.

54:51.079 --> 54:55.165
I never had a baby.
I was pregnant, but I lost it.

54:55.208 --> 54:57.167
Sorry to hear that, Emma.

54:57.210 --> 54:59.044
It always makes me cry to think about it.

54:59.129 --> 55:01.588
Oh, there, there, now.
You'll have another chance.

55:01.673 --> 55:04.800
Come on, I'd be surprised
if all you ladies weren't married soon.

55:04.884 --> 55:06.385
Especially by the way you dress.

55:06.428 --> 55:08.429
It's so seductive to a man.

55:08.513 --> 55:10.389
Do you like these stockings, Tom?

55:10.432 --> 55:13.058
- Oh, they're just divine.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

55:13.893 --> 55:15.853
What kind of a club is this, anyhow?

55:16.604 --> 55:18.564
God, Tom, you're a scream.

55:18.648 --> 55:20.357
He's terribly sweet.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.485
He is. I wouldn't mind doing him for nothing.

55:23.570 --> 55:25.654
Me neither, plus he's cute.

55:25.739 --> 55:26.989
Okay, you can count me in.

55:27.073 --> 55:29.241
Come on, Tom,
we're going to take you into the bedroom

55:29.326 --> 55:31.618
and give you an experience
you'll never forget.

55:31.703 --> 55:32.995
- And it's on us.
- Oh.

55:33.079 --> 55:34.580
I came here for a new experience.

55:34.622 --> 55:37.458
Well, now you're going
to get a champion roll in the hay.

55:37.542 --> 55:38.667
What? There's hay in the bedroom?

55:38.752 --> 55:42.171
(LAUGHING) You ever
been to a brothel before?

55:42.255 --> 55:45.424
- What's a brothel?
- You must be kidding.

55:45.467 --> 55:49.928
- A brothel, a bordello, a whore house.
- I'm not following.

55:50.013 --> 55:53.766
We go to bed with you
and make love and you pay us.

55:53.850 --> 55:57.644
Only because you're so sweet,
we want to treat you to a party.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.523
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

56:03.109 --> 56:05.694
Boy, this doesn't
ring a bell with anything I know.

56:05.779 --> 56:10.949
Oh, come on, buddy.
You know about making love, don't you?

56:11.034 --> 56:12.576
I can't make love with you.

56:12.619 --> 56:14.036
Don't tell me you don't like women.

56:14.120 --> 56:16.288
Or you were wounded in the war.

56:16.373 --> 56:18.832
No, no, I'm in love with someone else.

56:18.917 --> 56:22.044
We're not talking about in love,
we're talking about making love.

56:22.128 --> 56:25.589
- But, I love Cecilia.
- Well, so what? Marry Cecilia.

56:25.632 --> 56:27.132
This is just for fun.

56:27.175 --> 56:29.051
Oh, I couldn't do that, Emma.

56:29.135 --> 56:31.345
Ladies, my, my gracious!

56:31.429 --> 56:34.890
Nah, uh, look, don't think I'm
not appreciative of your offer.

56:34.974 --> 56:37.184
Though, I must say,
the concept is totally new to me.

56:37.268 --> 56:41.939
But, I'm just... I'm hopelessly
head over heels in love with Cecilia.

56:41.981 --> 56:43.482
She is all I want.

56:43.525 --> 56:46.276
My devotion is to her, my loyalties.

56:47.112 --> 56:49.947
Every breath
she takes makes my heart dance.

56:50.824 --> 56:52.741
This guy just kills me.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.994
Are there any other guys like you out there?

56:57.622 --> 56:59.415
CECILIA: Lawson's Music Store.

56:59.499 --> 57:02.000
This store has been here since I was a kid.

57:02.043 --> 57:04.503
Yeah. I wish I could play an instrument.

57:04.587 --> 57:09.007
That's my other ambition in life,
is to be a great classical violinist.

57:09.092 --> 57:11.635
Thousands cheering me night after night.

57:11.678 --> 57:13.262
I can play the ukulele.

57:13.346 --> 57:15.180
- You can?
- Uh-huh. My father taught me

57:15.223 --> 57:16.974
before he ran away.

57:20.520 --> 57:23.355
<i>I'm Alabamy bound</i>

57:23.398 --> 57:27.359
<i>There'll be no heebie jeebies hanging 'round</i>

57:27.444 --> 57:31.113

Whoo-hoo!

57:43.585 --> 57:47.212

Whoa.

57:54.137 --> 57:56.972
<i>I'm Alabamy bound</i>

57:57.056 --> 57:58.682
That was just wonderful.

57:58.725 --> 57:59.850
- Oh.
- That's wonderful.

57:59.893 --> 58:01.685
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, I was never... It's like a dream.

58:01.728 --> 58:02.728
(PIANO PLAYING)

58:02.854 --> 58:03.854
Oh, listen.

58:03.897 --> 58:04.980
I love my baby...

58:24.334 --> 58:26.210

- Aw, that was, you know...

58:45.230 --> 58:46.230
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

58:46.272 --> 58:48.023
Well, oh, after
the Lindbergh movie you should do...

58:48.107 --> 58:50.067
- The phone.
- ...a musical, really.

58:50.109 --> 58:51.902
Do you think...
You know, I did a one-bit in one once.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.820
I know, I saw <i>Dancing Doughboys,</i> sure.

58:53.905 --> 58:55.239
(LAUGHING) <i>Dancing Doughboys?</i>

58:55.281 --> 58:56.532
- You remembered.
- Yeah, that was great.

58:56.616 --> 58:59.076
I remember you turned
to Ina Beasley and you said,

58:59.118 --> 59:01.620
"I won't be going south
with you this winter."

59:01.663 --> 59:03.288
That's exact... Right, right!

59:03.331 --> 59:06.667
"I won't be going south
with you this winter. We have a little, uh,

59:06.751 --> 59:08.794
"score to settle
on the other side of the Atlantic."

59:08.878 --> 59:11.505
"Does this mean
I won't be seeing you ever again?"

59:11.589 --> 59:13.674
"Well, ever is a long time."

59:13.758 --> 59:16.134
"When you leave, don't look back."

59:16.719 --> 59:18.887
(CHUCKLING) You remember that...
You remember it perfectly.

59:18.972 --> 59:23.225
And then... And then
I took her in my arms, and I kissed her,

59:23.309 --> 59:25.644
knowing it was for the last time.

59:28.565 --> 59:31.108
God, you're beautiful, Cecilia.

59:31.150 --> 59:33.610
Was it fun? Kissing Ina Beasley?

59:33.653 --> 59:35.279
Oh, it was just, you know, it's a movie kiss.

59:35.321 --> 59:36.780
You know,
we professionals, we can put that...

59:36.823 --> 59:38.490
That stuff on just like that.

59:38.575 --> 59:40.701
It looked like you loved her.

59:50.878 --> 59:53.005
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my goodness!

59:54.424 --> 59:55.799
Feel my heart.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.634
- Uh, I... I...
- (EXHALES)

59:57.677 --> 01:00:00.679
I have to... I should...
Thank you so much for the ukulele.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.514
Oh, well, don't be offended.
I didn't mean to...

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.976
Oh, no. I'm not offended.
I'm just, uh... I'm confused.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:09.313
I'm married.
I just met a wonderful new man.

01:00:09.355 --> 01:00:11.356
He's fictional, but you can't have everything.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.191
Look, can I see you later?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.235
No, no. I'm meeting Tom.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.072
My own creation plagues me.

<i>- Will you shut up?
- Now calm down, calm down.</i>

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:34.254

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.761
<i>- The bosses.
- Oh.</i>

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:42.387
<i>Look at us!</i>

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.515

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:07.245
<i>Shut up, will you?</i>

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.122
<i>What if all this
is merely a matter of semantics?</i>

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.540
<i>How can it be semantics?</i>

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:13.418
<i>Well, wait a minute.
Let's just re-adjust our definitions.</i>

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.671
<i>Let's redefine ourselves as the real world,</i>

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:18.382
<i>and them as the
world of illusion and shadow.</i>

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:21.426
<i>You see, we're reality, they're a dream.</i>

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:23.595
<i>You better calm down.</i>

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:26.807
<i>You've been up on the screen,
flickering too long.</i>

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:30.435
REPORTER: It's confirmed.
LAWYER: It is?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.770
LAWYER: I was afraid this might happen.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:32.854
REPORTER: The Tom Baxter character

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.439
tried to leave the screen in four theaters.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:38.402
St. Louis, Chicago, Denver and Detroit,
and he almost made it in Detroit.

01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:40.654
- It looks bad.
- The movie houses in those towns

01:01:40.738 --> 01:01:41.988
are in a state of pandemonium.

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:43.407
There's no way to keep the lid on it.

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:45.325
I see lawsuits, hundreds of lawsuits!

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.119
We better pull the picture out of release.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:49.454
- What, in those towns?
- No, everywhere.

01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:51.498
Something's obviously
gone very wrong here,

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:55.711
and the best course of action
is to shut down, take our losses

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:58.714
and get out of this mess
before it really gets out of hand.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.632
Sure, can you
imagine hundreds of Tom Baxters

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:01.842
flying around wild?

01:02:01.926 --> 01:02:04.636
Right, and you
responsible for every one of them.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:08.098
Well, the best thing to do is to quit
while there's only one of them out there.

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:09.349
But what do we do about him?

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.101
We've got to get him back in the picture.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:13.854
Then we turn off the projector,
and burn the prints.

01:02:13.938 --> 01:02:15.021
And the negative.

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:17.816
What a shame. It was such a good picture.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.901
I missed you. You're late.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:23.029
I'm sorry,
I just... I came as quickly as I could.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:25.991
- I love you.
- Oh! Oh, thank you.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.911
Tom, my feelings are so jumbled.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.414
Oh, I know, I know.
You're married, and you're old-fashioned,

01:02:32.498 --> 01:02:33.874
and I'm a whole new idea.

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.501
But the truth is you're unhappily married.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:38.253
And I'm gonna take you away from all this.

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:40.422
Yeah, I know you love me.

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:43.383
Cecilia, I do love you.
Don't you share my feelings?

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.343
Well, I... That's just it.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.722
(STAMMERING) You're some
kind of phantom.

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:52.017
Look, I don't want
to talk any more about what's real

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:55.395
and what's illusion. Life's too short
to spend time thinking about life.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.564
- Let's just live it.
- Live it how?

01:02:57.648 --> 01:02:59.524
Well, we'll begin with dinner.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.235
Oh, well, listen.
No, I've only got a few dollars.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.528
Well, we're not gonna use your money.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:04.863
Well, that's all we have!

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:06.490
Unless you've done something.

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:09.159
Well, say no more.
The moon will be full, the stars will be out,

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:10.327
and we're going stepping.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:12.788
- But we're broke.
- Leave that to me.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:42.108
<i>It's him! Tom, you're back!</i>

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.569
I want you to meet my fiancée, Cecilia.

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:46.112
This... Oh, well, you know all these people.

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:47.906
<i>It's not possible!</i>

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:49.741
I'm in the world of the possible.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.911
<i>Yeah? Well, you better get back
in the story, you little weasel!</i>

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.871

- Cecilia, my money is good up here.</i>

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.678
<i>- You've got too much money.
- Like I'm floating on air!</i>

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:10.971

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:12.764

- What's the difference? He's back, isn't he?</i>

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:13.932

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.642

01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:19.771
<i>But she's here with me,

Well, I... I came in here to think.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.899
What are you doing here?

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.527
<i>I took her on a date, all right?</i>

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.194
<i>Now, can't you just leave us alone?</i>

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.363
No, I can't leave her alone.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.533
I'm jealous.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.118
<i>You're jealous?</i>

01:09:25.202 --> 01:09:26.202
Well, what do you want me to say?

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:28.912
I can't get Cecilia out of my mind.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.747
<i>Gil, do you mean that?</i>

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:34.460
<i>Oh, for God's sake,
would you go back to Hollywood? Please.</i>

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:37.171
Look, I'm embarrassed to admit it, Cecilia.

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.883
You know, you said I had a magical glow?

01:09:39.925 --> 01:09:43.094
But that's you, you're the one that has one.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:46.890
And even though we've just met,
I know that this is the real thing.

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:49.934
You can't be in love with Cecilia.
She's in love with me.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.270
I'll tell you what, why don't you
turn around and re-enter the film?

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.604
I'm never going back!

01:09:53.647 --> 01:09:55.607
<i>I can't believe it, they're at it again.</i>

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.942
<i>Tom, will you get back up here?</i>

01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:00.111
See, there you go, Tom.
You're ruining everything.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:01.696
You are!
You're the one who's ruining everything.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.364
You know, if it wasn't for me,
there wouldn't be any you!

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:04.991
Don't be so sure! I could've been played

01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:06.910
by Fredric March or Leslie Howard!

01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:10.705
<i>You're wrong. The part's
too insignificant to attract a major star.</i>

01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:13.249
- Insignificant!
- Like hell it is! What are you talking about?

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:14.751
Minor character?
I am not a minor character!

01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:15.919
What do you mean, a minor character?

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:17.212
Jeez!

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.631
You know, I haven't
been able to think of anything since we met.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:23.468
I just, I have to have some time with you
to show you what real life can be like

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.262
if two people really care for each other.

01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.057
Last week, I was unloved.

01:10:29.141 --> 01:10:33.478
Now, two people love me,
and it's the same two people.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.647
<i>Go with the real guy, honey. We're limited.</i>

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:37.857
<i>Go with Tom. He's got no flaws.</i>

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:40.318
<i>Go with somebody, child,
'cause I's getting bored.</i>

01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:43.112
She's gonna marry me.
You're just... You're wasting your time.

01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:45.198
Will you get back on the screen?

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:47.533
I'm trying to tell Cecilia I'm in love with her.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:50.995
I love you.
I'm honest, dependable, courageous,

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.081
romantic and a great kisser.

01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:54.249
And I'm real!

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.000
LARRY: <i>Let's go, Cecilia!</i>

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.628
<i>Choose one of them
so we can settle this thing.</i>

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:01.673
<i>The most human of all attributes
is your ability to choose.</i>

01:11:01.715 --> 01:11:03.132
<i>Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:05.677
<i>If she chooses Tom,
how are we gonna end the story?</i>

01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:07.136
<i>We'll be stuck here forever.</i>

01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:09.681
Father Donnelly can
marry us right here in the movie house.

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.015
No, that won't stand up in court.

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:12.350
The priest has to be human.

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:14.936
<i>The Bible never says
a priest can't be on film!</i>

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.397
No, uh, I'm already married!

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:19.274
Come away with me to Hollywood.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.609
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.861
Do something impulsive
for once in your life.

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:28.283
I mean, just throw your stuff in a valise
and come away with me. Really.

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:29.867
(CHUCKLING) And don't forget that ukulele.

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:31.536
What ukulele?

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:33.121
Look, I love you.

01:11:33.205 --> 01:11:37.208
I know that only happens in movies,
but I do.

01:11:42.214 --> 01:11:43.298
Tom?

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.093
<i>Cecilia, you're throwing away perfection.</i>

01:11:47.177 --> 01:11:49.679
<i>Don't tell her that! We need Tom back!</i>

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.306
<i>It's so romantic.</i>

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.640
<i>Oh, women!</i>

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:53.891
(SIGHS)

01:11:55.602 --> 01:11:58.730
Well, I'm crushed, I'm devastated. It's...

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.650
Tom, try to understand.

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:05.486
You'll be fine.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:09.157
In your world, things have a way
of always working out right.

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:10.867
See, I'm a real person.

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:16.164
No matter how tempted I am,
I have to choose the real world.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.751
I loved every minute with you.

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.921
And I'll never forget our night on the town.

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:28.926
Goodbye.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:44.442
HENRY: <i>Well, you're better off with us,
old sport, you really are.</i>

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.778
JASON: <i>Can we get on
with</i> The Purple Rose of Cairo, <i>please?</i>

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:49.030
COUNTESS: <i>If anyone wants me,
I'll be in reel six.</i>

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:51.699
<i>- Kitty's waiting for you.</i>
- DELILAH: <i>Lord have mercy!</i>

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:54.786
<i>What a day! What a day!</i>

01:13:26.026 --> 01:13:27.819
So, your explorer friend's okay?

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.612
I saw him walking around town with you.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.740
Yeah, he's okay. No thanks to you.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:33.991
I didn't mean to be so rough on him.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.701
It's just that
I get jealous when it comes to you.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:37.995
- Do you?
- Christ, you know I do.

01:13:38.622 --> 01:13:40.081
I know I treat you rough. It's my way.

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:42.834
- It doesn't mean I don't feel for you.
- Oh.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.838
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.048
- Here we go again.
- You don't feel for me, Monk.

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:50.633
All you feel for is yourself!

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:54.387
Your beer, your card games, your women!

01:13:54.471 --> 01:13:56.681
Okay, I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:59.183
- No, I'm not kidding...
- It's too late, Monk. It's too late, I'm going.

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:01.018
I should have left a long time ago.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.521
I would have,
except I was scared of being alone.

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.772
So what now?

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.191
You found some chump
who's filling your head with big ideas?

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:09.777
No, no, I got a chance to change my life.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:11.863
- I'm moving to Hollywood.
- All right, now listen, Cecilia,

01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:14.532
I said I was sorry
about being rough with your friend,

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:15.616
but let's shape up!

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.285
- It's too late, Monk!
- Look, like hell it...

01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:18.703
I said like hell it is!

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:21.205
And don't be giving me
that big-headed stuff, you hear?

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:22.790
Because I'm the guy
that can slap you down!

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:23.958
Go ahead and hit me, Monk!

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.793
Just go ahead and hit me!

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:27.253
- I'm leaving anyway!
- Yeah, well,

01:14:27.337 --> 01:14:29.213
this never would have happened
if you didn't meet that guy.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.257
That's probably right,
and we would have just gone on

01:14:31.341 --> 01:14:34.469
the same way till we were too old
to even hope for something better.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:37.972
But I did meet him!
I did meet him, and I have feelings for him!

01:14:38.056 --> 01:14:40.725
- And he has for me!
- What about me?

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:44.395
I still care for you, Monk,
if you can believe that.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.273
But out of the blue,
for the first time in my life,

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:48.399
somebody's in love with me!

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:50.902
No, but you just met each other.

01:14:50.944 --> 01:14:54.614
Love at first sight
doesn't only happen just in the movies.

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:55.948
Hey, Cecilia, don't go.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:57.909
You hear me?
I said don't go! Now wait a minute.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.495
- Don't! I said... I said don't go!
- So long, Monk.

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:02.622
- You stay here, you hear?
- You take care of yourself.

01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:05.666
Oh, yeah? All right, well, go, go!
See if I care.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.043
Go, see what it is out there!

01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:10.171
It ain't the movies! It's real life!

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.089
It's real life, and you'll be back!

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.592
You mark my words! You'll be back!

01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:42.787
Cecilia, what are you doing here?

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:45.748
- Meeting Gil Shepherd.
- They all gone.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.083
They...

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:48.793
What do... What do you mean?

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.962
Went back to Hollywood.

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.338
Gil, too?

01:15:52.422 --> 01:15:54.298
Mr. Shepherd, yeah.

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:57.468
As soon as Tom Baxter
went back up on the movie screen,

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.178
he couldn't wait to get out of here.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:02.139
He said this was a close call for his career.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.685
I think he's gonna play Charles Lindbergh.

01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:14.235
Don't forget, Cecilia,

01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:17.154
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers start today.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:48.853
<i>Heaven, I'm in heaven</i>

01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:56.777
<i>And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak</i>

01:16:56.862 --> 01:17:02.450
<i>And I seem to find the happiness I seek</i>

01:17:03.243 --> 01:17:09.373
<i>When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:14.545
<i>Heaven, I'm in heaven</i>

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:21.719
<i>And the cares that hung
around me through the week</i>

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:27.058
<i>Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak</i>

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.065
<i>When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek</i>

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.235
<i>Oh, I love to climb a mountain</i>

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.447
<i>And to reach the highest peak</i>

01:17:41.531 --> 01:17:45.076
<i>But it doesn't thrill me half as much</i>

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:48.871
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

01:17:49.305 --> 01:17:55.173
