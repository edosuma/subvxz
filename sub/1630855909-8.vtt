WEBVTT

00:07.006 --> 00:10.385
Magnesium-J. Hydrogen-F. Father.

00:10.969 --> 00:14.431
I am ready to re-join
my brethren on Alphabetrium.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.475
Very well. Your exile ends today.

00:21.187 --> 00:24.149
Welcome home, Water-T.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.445
-The Numbericons! They’re attacking.
-Battle stations!

00:38.037 --> 00:40.582
Divide and conquer! Zero survivors!

00:44.961 --> 00:45.879
Father!

00:46.504 --> 00:48.465
Son, take this thing.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.803
It’s a prophecy or some shit.
I’m dying. Peace.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.020
Water-T, where are you going?
There’s too many of them.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.606
Then I better crunch the numbers.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.612
When your heart adds up!

01:11.112 --> 01:14.783
One plus one makes you!

01:20.413 --> 01:21.748
Alright!

01:24.876 --> 01:26.878
He’s too dope! Retreat!

01:28.004 --> 01:31.716
Oh yeah!
We don’t care about numbers!

01:31.800 --> 01:33.259
Shit! He’s crunching the numbers!

01:33.343 --> 01:36.554
I thought he was talking about taxes,
but he’s crunching us!

01:36.638 --> 01:38.014
I’m deduct your ass.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.230
They activated the bracket shields!
We can’t pull up!

01:45.313 --> 01:47.816
Somebody kiss me!
I don’t wanna die not knowing love!

01:53.196 --> 01:54.197
Oh yeah!

01:54.697 --> 01:56.991
We don’t care about numbers!

01:57.826 --> 02:00.787
Sorry I’m late. I had to go Pe.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.414
What do you know about this?

02:03.832 --> 02:06.501
The "i" of Harmony?
It holds some secret power,

02:06.584 --> 02:08.044
but it’s in a language nobody can read.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.172
You don’t gotta read shit, Lithium P.
It’s math.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.883
Careful, T. They won’t like that
kind of number talk at the palace.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.427
We’re not going to the palace,
we’re going to Earth.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.721
Why? You know a math expert there?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.849
Unfortunately, I do.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.227
In conclusion, without math,
planes wouldn’t fly

02:24.310 --> 02:26.729
and elephants would forget.
What is that sound?

02:26.813 --> 02:29.524
Who is using air buds
to listen to rap music?

02:29.607 --> 02:30.942
Sorry, Mister Goldenfold.

02:31.025 --> 02:34.696
Detention! Class dismissed early
so Morty can have instant detention!

02:34.779 --> 02:36.739
-No! I want to learn!
-I want to add and stuff.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.158
Geez, Mr. Goldenfold!
It’s just a little hip hop,

02:39.492 --> 02:40.785
it helps me concentrate

02:40.869 --> 02:43.079
Rap will never help anyone
do anything!

02:43.162 --> 02:44.747
Some things never change.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.915
-Ice-T?
-Ice-T?

02:45.999 --> 02:50.253
Ice-T, it’s me, Morty!
Remember me? Get Schwifty?

02:50.587 --> 02:51.504
No.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.798
And it’s Water-T now.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.884
I don’t give an ass
if you’re Smokey Robinson.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.428
You got the balls of a clown
coming back to this school

02:58.511 --> 02:59.929
without the homework you owe me!

03:00.013 --> 03:02.724
Fuck your homework, old man!
My planet’s at stake!

03:02.807 --> 03:05.184
Mr. Goldenfold,
you taught Ice-T math?

03:05.268 --> 03:08.688
I tried, Morty.
I sure the hell tried.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.941
Without math, Russia would control
all Rubik's Cubes.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.818
-Any questions?
-Just one.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.446
Who gives a fuck!

03:16.905 --> 03:19.657
I am a knight, walking,
back of class talking,

03:20.116 --> 03:22.118
homework scoffing,
blackboard chalking.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.163
Look man,
I ain’t here for memory lane shit,

03:25.246 --> 03:26.581
I need this deciphered.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.543
Early Algebraic.
Possibly even geometric.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.921
-English!
-I don’t teach english, bitch!

03:33.004 --> 03:35.506
And why should I do your homework?
You didn’t do mine!

03:35.590 --> 03:36.758
Cuz I had no home!

03:38.718 --> 03:39.636
Now I do.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.639
Help me save it.

03:46.726 --> 03:50.647
All Type Strikers, attack!
Kill the Son of Magma-Q!

03:50.730 --> 03:52.774
I want his serifs.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.071
You’re coming with me, Goldenfold.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.864
You better be taking me
to your homework.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.449
-You’re coming with me, Morty!
-Why?

04:01.532 --> 04:03.368
It’s called detention,
not releastion!

04:08.915 --> 04:12.126
-Sorry I’m late, I had to go pe.
-I know.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.128
Well, there’s new people.
I thought they’d like to hear about it.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.463
Just start the fucking ship.

04:19.842 --> 04:23.846
I see the tales of your dopeness
have been greatly exaggerated.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.974
Big talk from an upside down L.

04:26.057 --> 04:30.478
I am Sinistar Seven!
And I am here to spill the T.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.188
Then come get me, mother fucker.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.949
She’s got a Caps Lock!

04:43.032 --> 04:45.535
And an ass to suck.
Hit the hyphen drive!

04:48.538 --> 04:50.081
No! No!

04:55.086 --> 04:56.170
Speak.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.215
Lord Dread Nought,
Water-T escaped with the i of Harmony.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.552
It’s the one of harmony!

05:04.053 --> 05:05.263
That’s gotta hurt.

05:06.222 --> 05:10.727
You’re a number, act like it.
Subtract Water-T from life,

05:10.810 --> 05:12.854
and carry the One to me.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.648
I won’t let you down, Father.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.150
Too late.

05:17.233 --> 05:21.738
Too late! God!
I love my job!

05:22.655 --> 05:25.783
The Pythagorean Theorem.
I just have to figure out

05:25.867 --> 05:29.912
what A and B are, square them both
and then add them together.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.039
Can you do it?

05:31.122 --> 05:34.083
-If I do, I want my homework.
-Fine!

05:35.084 --> 05:37.045
Why do you guys
hate each other so much?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.213
Why do all teachers
hate all students, Morty?

05:39.297 --> 05:41.632
Because you all
break our god damn hearts.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.676
Just seems like there’s
more going on there.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.178
Was he that bad at math?

05:45.261 --> 05:48.389
No, Morty, nobody is worse than you.
The hurtful thing about

05:48.473 --> 05:50.391
your friend back
there is that at one point

05:50.475 --> 05:52.435
it seemed like he might learn.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.189
I am a nightmare walking,
psychopath talking,

05:56.522 --> 05:59.942
king of my jungle just a gangster
stalk stalking. Stalking. Fuck.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.987
Look all this non-scholastic depravity!

06:03.071 --> 06:07.492
Reef-er? Chee-tos? And not
a smidgen of homework in sight.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.119
Why you coming in here
fucking up my words?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.872
T, maybe you oughta go back to school.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.957
You can’t keep a beat
to save your ass.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.627
Damn. My dream just died.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.798
Here. Follow this!
It’s called four four time.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.133
1, 2, 3, 4.

06:24.675 --> 06:28.304
-2, 2, 3, 4.
-I am a nightmare walking

06:28.387 --> 06:31.974
Psychopath talking, king of my jungle
just a gangster stalking

06:32.058 --> 06:34.852
-Living life like a firecracker
-Chuck! It’s Marvin!

06:35.478 --> 06:40.191
Your cousin Marvin D? Ya know that
new sound you looking for?

06:40.274 --> 06:42.819
Well, listen to this!

06:43.236 --> 06:44.737
The gangs of L.A. will never die.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.782
Got ya again, mother-fucker!

06:47.865 --> 06:50.993
You’d think that guy’s cousin
would stop taking his calls.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.245
That’s not the point, Morty!

06:52.328 --> 06:54.997
You included it in your story!
But I get it.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.000
You and T were actually friends.
So, what went wrong?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.920
Nice try, Morty. You think that
if I connect with you

07:01.003 --> 07:03.422
I’ll let you out of detention?
Well, you can forget it.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.882
I’m all about boundaries now.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.551
Boundaries! I got it!

07:07.718 --> 07:08.886
-What is it?
-It’s a map!

07:09.303 --> 07:12.056
A squared is the length of the galaxy.
B squared is the height.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.433
So C squared takes you directly to.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.227
Planet E-10?

07:16.310 --> 07:19.689
Ain’t E-10 supposed to be where God
created letters or some shit?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.358
That’s just a story we tell
lowercase letters at bed time.

07:22.441 --> 07:23.568
Maybe there’s more to it.

07:23.651 --> 07:24.861
-Why bed time?
-What?

07:24.944 --> 07:27.947
He said it was a story you told
lowercase letters at bed time,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.032
you never tell
the story during the day?

07:30.116 --> 07:32.535
I guess I just hoped the phrase
"bed time" would make it easier

07:32.618 --> 07:35.204
to understand that lowercase letters
are our version of children.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.831
So you did that for me?

07:36.914 --> 07:39.208
Well, half the people here are human,
I didn’t want to exclude you.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.501
We would have figured
out it was children.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.336
Lowercase means smaller, we get it.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.880
It feels like I’m being punished
for clarity.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.090
-Punished? Jesus. I asked a question.
-So did Hitler!

07:46.174 --> 07:49.135
What the fuck is going on?
Somebody set up a call or some shit.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.220
We need to send word to Alphabetrium.

07:57.435 --> 08:01.272
Oxygen-S, we’ve deciphered the i
of Harmony and we’re headed to E-10.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.732
That’s incredible, Water-T.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.901
Give me your coordinates,
I’ll send help immediately.

08:05.526 --> 08:08.070
-Word.
-Happy to serve, my lord.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.531
In quotes!

08:12.617 --> 08:13.910
Secret villain!

08:15.119 --> 08:18.080
Coming out of Helvetica Light Speed,
and approaching Planet E-10.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.542
-God damn.
-Maybe it knows it’s home.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.419
What the math is happening?

08:24.629 --> 08:25.963
Die, Letter scum!

08:28.299 --> 08:31.844
I’m sick and tired of this bullshit.
Yo Seven, count this!

08:32.845 --> 08:34.096
Three-zus Christ!

08:48.819 --> 08:51.030
-Typical letter, acting on emotion!
-You’re welcome

08:51.113 --> 08:54.158
-for saving your numbery-ass, ass!
-I won’t let you take me alive!

08:54.242 --> 08:55.159
Have it your way!

08:55.743 --> 08:57.286
If you’re gonna act
like ignorant children,

08:57.370 --> 08:58.871
I guess the teacher’s in charge!

08:59.205 --> 09:02.708
And young lady, whoever told you
numbers can’t be emotional

09:02.792 --> 09:06.003
did you wrong.
On Earth, numbers get down.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.131
-Sometimes even with letters.
-Disgusting!

09:09.215 --> 09:11.801
See that’s what everyone says,
but then they go home

09:11.884 --> 09:13.636
and they type all kinds
of shit into Pornhub.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.307
We’re surrounded by primitive googas!

09:20.893 --> 09:23.521
Okay! The primitive googas
worship the glowing thing!

09:23.604 --> 09:25.982
Things don’t always resolve this fast,
we’re making good time.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.693
Scribble! Jot jot!
Scribble! Doodle!

09:28.776 --> 09:29.819
We can’t understand you.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.822
Obviously, they want to take us
to their village for an Ewok party.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.824
Damn, making really good time.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.000
This tribe claims the artifact
comes from a religious site

09:44.083 --> 09:45.126
not far from here.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.502
Awful nice of you to help.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.131
I’m simply following the rules of war
as your prisoner.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.716
Or maybe you’re hoping
if you’re nice,

09:51.799 --> 09:54.176
I’ll let my guard down
so you can take the i.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.847
How dare you. I’m not a seductress,
I am a warrior.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.725
-And that’s not an i, it’s a one.
-It’s an i!

10:00.808 --> 10:02.059
You guys don’t get out much?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.062
It seems kinda obvious
that these Scribbles are, like,

10:05.146 --> 10:07.773
the original species that letters
and numbers came from.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.693
So that relic thing
probably isn’t a one or an i

10:10.776 --> 10:14.363
it’s probably just, like, a line.
It’s symbolic of the fact

10:14.447 --> 10:16.073
that your people
don’t need to be at war.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.035
-How do I know you again?
-Get Schwifty?

10:19.368 --> 10:21.912
Still nothing.
So mind your damn business.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.497
At least we agree on that.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.335
Looks like your detention
is officially over.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.044
Why?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.338
You finally learned
how hard it is to teach.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.130
No I didn’t.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.216
Then you learned
how hard it is to learn.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.927
-I already knew...
-Just go to bed, you ungrateful shit!

10:38.971 --> 10:41.057
-Cock a doodle!
-Cock a doodle two!

10:42.725 --> 10:44.352
The i, it’s gone!

10:45.561 --> 10:47.897
That bitch! Seven took the i!

10:48.272 --> 10:49.440
C’mon, Mr. Goldenfold!

10:49.523 --> 10:52.234
Count me out, Morty.
I’m tired of helping that sonofabitch.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.612
Seriously?
Feels like there’sa deeper beef

10:54.695 --> 10:57.198
than missing homework here.
What really happened?

10:57.281 --> 11:00.076
It was the summer of 1991...

11:00.159 --> 11:02.578
Any friend of Ice-T
is welcome in my home.

11:02.661 --> 11:05.206
And as governor,
I can’t wait to add that math

11:05.289 --> 11:07.541
wing to Harry Herpson High School,
Mr. Goldenfold.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.418
And I shall put it to good use, sir!

11:09.502 --> 11:12.588
Of course you will,
more baby potatoes?

11:14.006 --> 11:15.591
God damn, I love rap.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.391
And the Grammy award for Rap Artist
of the Year goes to...

11:24.100 --> 11:25.309
Ice-T!

11:30.648 --> 11:33.776
I just want to thank my words,
the letters that made them

11:33.859 --> 11:36.654
and that’s it. Nothing else. Peace!

11:37.905 --> 11:39.740
I thought you said he’d thank math!

11:39.824 --> 11:42.576
There must be some mistake,
try a different channel?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.328
The mistake was believing you
even knew Ice-T

11:44.412 --> 11:46.288
and could get me
that math-loving youth vote!

11:46.372 --> 11:49.708
Now get outta here! I’ve got a god damn
presidential campaign to start.

11:51.001 --> 11:54.463
After that, my dreams faded away
like so many erections.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.591
I mean, that sucks
but let’s stop Sinistar-7

11:57.675 --> 11:59.635
and maybe you two sort
this out on the way home?

12:00.302 --> 12:04.014
Pretty sound logic.
And logic IS a part of math.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.015
Whatever c’mon!

12:06.892 --> 12:08.269
If you’re pregnant,
that’s my cell number.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.729
I know you can’t read it,
but it’s important I made an effort.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.824
-Nice try!
-How dare you!

12:21.907 --> 12:22.867
How dare you!

12:48.225 --> 12:50.519
Shit!
I think when we started getting it on

12:50.603 --> 12:53.022
that amulet showed us
the truth of our origins.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.567
-Father!
-We’re into the same sick shit.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.194
No, my father! He’s here!

12:58.277 --> 13:00.529
-What’s that?
-Emperor Dread Nought.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.786
The fate of the Alphabetrians
is at hand.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.372
Magma-Q’s legacy ends here.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.208
How the fuck did he find us?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.876
Betrayal reveal!

13:16.086 --> 13:19.381
You appear displeased to see me,
Prince Water-T.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.926
Cold-ass mother-fucker,
you in league with Dread Nought?

13:22.259 --> 13:24.678
How could you do us
Letters dirty like that, S?

13:24.762 --> 13:28.766
My true name is not S,
on Numbericonia they call me...

13:29.725 --> 13:30.768
Eight.

13:30.851 --> 13:35.564
Eight? Oh my god, he’s a number?
Did you know? I didn’t!

13:36.815 --> 13:40.444
Holy shit! I’m not even supposed
to be here today it’s my day off!

13:40.528 --> 13:43.322
For real, that’s how much I like
working with these people!

13:45.658 --> 13:48.369
Good thing your father isn’t alive
to see you fail,

13:48.452 --> 13:50.079
he’d be so disappointed.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.081
Motherfucker!
I’m gonna shoot you in the dick.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.543
I would like to see you try.
Villain exit!

13:56.001 --> 13:59.213
Thanks for dragging me across
the universe to be killed, Water-T.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.798
No homework-doing, mother-grabbin.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.926
You wanna go old man?
I’ll fuck you stil you love me!

14:04.009 --> 14:07.721
I’ll put your kids through college!
I’ll fucking take you to Boca Raton

14:07.805 --> 14:08.597
you motherfucker!

14:08.681 --> 14:12.601
Ease up, Water-T. After all,
you did betray Goldenfold by,

14:12.685 --> 14:15.604
not thanking math at the Grammys.
I guess.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.608
That’s what you think happened?
G-Folds. It went like this.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.572
Didja listen to my album, Pop?
It’s nominated for a Grammy.

14:24.655 --> 14:29.285
Yes. I heard your album. What is
this four-four time, rhythm nonsense?

14:29.368 --> 14:32.162
It’s disgusting!
You’re a number-loving traitor

14:32.246 --> 14:34.582
who doesn’t care
about anything but himself.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.544
I never knew.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.004
You never asked!

14:40.087 --> 14:41.255
Here, Father.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.883
The destiny of the Numbericons
is mine to claim!

14:45.217 --> 14:47.845
Everyone has to watch
while I do it, too!

14:48.387 --> 14:50.014
How does this thing work again?

14:50.097 --> 14:51.640
Allow me, my lord.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.642
Hold up. You’re just going to let
this motherfucker come up and...

15:08.073 --> 15:09.074
I don’t get it.

15:09.450 --> 15:13.287
The ultimate power of the universe
is finally mine!

15:13.370 --> 15:15.873
I am the ruler of the Numbericons!

15:16.332 --> 15:18.000
The dead rule nothing!

15:18.751 --> 15:20.502
Father! No!

15:20.586 --> 15:24.673
Your father was a bitch.
You shall be my general now!

15:24.757 --> 15:26.050
Well, he was a bad father...

15:26.133 --> 15:29.887
I am Infinity,
omnipotent God of Numbers!

15:29.970 --> 15:33.432
And I have a world
of Letters to destroy!

15:35.684 --> 15:38.062
I guess he doesn’t need
the ship anymore?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.356
You heard Infinity. Move out!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.070
We coulda had something.

15:46.695 --> 15:50.699
It was a mistake, T.
Letters and Numbers can never be.

15:57.414 --> 16:00.000
What do we do?
He’s gonna destroy Alphabetrium!

16:00.084 --> 16:01.960
Whatever. I don’t care anymore.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.421
-Damn, T. That’s cold.
-Exactly.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.342
-God damn!
-You do remember our adventure.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.343
Not really.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.430
Dope shit, T!

16:13.514 --> 16:16.475
If we don’t stop Infinity,
he’s gonna destroy Alphabetrium!

16:16.558 --> 16:19.103
But that ooze-swamp
put the kibosh on our spaceships.

16:19.186 --> 16:23.232
Maybe we can pull it out and upgrade
it using parts of the numbers ship...

16:23.315 --> 16:26.360
The googas already did it.
You guys work fast.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.781
Damn. It’s like the Glyph Jumper,
but extreme.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.867
Big fun now! Ship fast.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.911
The Glyph Jumper Extreme is rad!

16:36.370 --> 16:39.373
Let’s go home
and bust a cap in Infinity’s ass.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.667
Wait! Let me go pee first,
that way when we get there,

16:41.750 --> 16:42.626
I’ll get to say.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.545
well, I’m not gonna spoil it!

16:52.970 --> 16:56.223
Death to all Letters!
Neither upper nor lower case

16:56.306 --> 16:58.100
will survive this day!

17:02.271 --> 17:05.524
The Brackets Shield has fallen!
It’s an utter apostrophe!

17:06.775 --> 17:09.778
I am bigger than letters!
I am bigger than numbers!

17:09.862 --> 17:13.574
My balls are huge
and everyone can suck my dick!

17:16.076 --> 17:17.995
Stop! You’re killing numbers!

17:20.289 --> 17:21.999
My lord, this is too far.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.292
Are you still fucking talking?

17:23.667 --> 17:26.253
Here’s a number for you lady,
86 that ass!

17:26.336 --> 17:27.254
You’re fired!

17:30.632 --> 17:32.301
Suck this, bitch!

17:36.388 --> 17:37.681
T, is that your girl?

17:43.353 --> 17:45.189
That’s twice I’ve saved your ass.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.358
Infinity’s gone mad with power.
He’s killing everyone.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.319
And every two,

17:50.402 --> 17:52.196
-and every three and every...
-We get it.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.657
I was wrong to join him.
And wrong to leave you, Water T.

17:56.074 --> 17:58.285
Infinity killed both our fathers.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.829
I was there. The ceiling fell on him.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.291
Father!

18:04.374 --> 18:05.834
That ceiling was poisoned.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.546
Oxygen-S planned Magma-Q’s
assassination for months.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.549
All my life I’ve served
such negative numbers.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.676
This kid I don’t know
was right all along.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.594
Finally!

18:15.677 --> 18:18.597
It’s time for the Numbericons
to rise and join us!

18:18.680 --> 18:21.600
How can we make the Numbericons
rise up against him?

18:22.309 --> 18:23.560
We’ll inspire them.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.440
Kill! Murder! Death!

18:39.201 --> 18:41.286
Why does a 1 hate an "i",
i gotta wonder?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.747
When a lower case i
is an imaginary number.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.833
Who stands to gain
when i shoot up a digit?

18:45.916 --> 18:48.544
The division is complex,
but you know we gotta bridge it.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.758
You think you can stop me with rap?

18:57.052 --> 18:59.179
More homicides
than a dodecahedron

18:59.263 --> 19:01.181
Number vs letters the shit
that it feeds on

19:01.265 --> 19:05.060
Today, alpha-numerically combine
Like g-l-o-c-k means

19:05.144 --> 19:06.144
-My ice cold ‘9!

19:06.937 --> 19:09.815
I got letters and numbers
every time i fuck a hole

19:09.898 --> 19:12.234
giving her 1 big dick
while she screams "o"!

19:13.986 --> 19:16.488
Magma-Q gets’em wet
like she got her cry on

19:16.572 --> 19:20.784
My dick’s 3.14 feet it’s a Pi-thon
Ya’ll actin’ scared. He ain’t won yet

19:20.868 --> 19:23.579
Infinity to one odds?
That’s an alpha-bet.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.372
Father? You like a force ghost now?

19:25.455 --> 19:28.375
The fuck it look like, son?
I came back to help

19:28.458 --> 19:30.210
you hand Infinity his ass.
You ready?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.587
Let’s kill it, Pops.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.797
Infinity ain’t shit
without numbers and letters.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.966
We can blow his ass out
if we work together.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.885
Rise up!
Letters and numbers

19:37.968 --> 19:40.637
I said rise up!
Cuz you know we’re all brothers!

19:44.683 --> 19:47.811
Arise, King Magma-T.

19:58.989 --> 20:02.201
My word!
Water-T’s spitting straight fire!

20:02.284 --> 20:04.786
He truly is King of Alphabetrium.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.042
Infinity’s too strong!
Nothing can defeat him!

20:10.125 --> 20:12.127
You think? How bout this shit.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.420
The I of Harmony!

20:13.503 --> 20:16.089
-Motherfuckers just left it.
-How will that help us?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.592
This thing loves
when letters and numbers get down.

20:18.926 --> 20:19.843
C’mere girl

20:21.678 --> 20:23.138
You like that?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.807
Hell yeah!

20:25.891 --> 20:28.685
You cannot stop me!
I’m infinitely infinite!

20:33.315 --> 20:34.274
My fucking dick!

20:34.608 --> 20:36.234
Thought I was lying, mother-fucker?

20:39.279 --> 20:41.657
Mr. Goldenfold, I love math!

20:41.740 --> 20:43.867
And it loves you too, Morty.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.495
I have to warn you,
I’m a prime number.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.330
I’m only divisible by myself.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.667
And my dick’s magma now.
But we’ll figure it out.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.801
How’s that math homework
coming along, Morty?

21:00.884 --> 21:04.513
It’s great, it’s so great.
Do you mind if I do a second test,

21:04.596 --> 21:07.140
-you know, for fun?
-You’re weird.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.934
And what about you, sir?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.394
There! All done!

21:10.477 --> 21:13.563
Here’s your god damn homework,
old man. Happy?

21:13.647 --> 21:16.400
More than you can possibly imagine.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.396
King Magma-T,
my people need you.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.397
And who are you?

21:57.190 --> 21:59.026
Ice Cube of the Geomitrons.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.862
My planet getting all bent out
of shape by the Formivores.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.740
You Numbers and Letters strong
enough to fight them muthafuckers?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.993
The warriors of Alpha-Numbericon
are unmatched in strength.

22:08.076 --> 22:11.413
And we never refuse to help
a brother in need.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.207
Word!
My smokeshow queen speaks truth.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.876
I’ll grab my shit
and meet you out front.

22:17.961 --> 22:18.879
Cool.
