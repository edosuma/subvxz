WEBVTT

00:08.840 --> 00:12.378
- Nice place you got here.
Chair empty?
- Sure thing.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.106
What brings you in here, Shadow?
- I'm just waiting
for my partner.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.301
I saw you were open, figured
I'd get a little off the sides.

00:17.350 --> 00:21.309
- Yeah... Like when you were a
sports commentator, that look?
- Yeah.

00:21.350 --> 00:25.684
- Man, I must'a watched your
"EpicFail" video a hundred
times. Freaking hilarious.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.518
- Always nice to meet a fan.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.228
- Yo.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.339
Is that you?!

00:41.340 --> 00:44.309
- I'll get that cut
another time.

00:45.510 --> 00:48.479
- Ooh! I'd lock
the shop for that.

00:48.510 --> 00:51.741
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's alright.
What's with the getup?

00:51.780 --> 00:54.214
You go undercover without me?
- Nope.

00:54.250 --> 00:57.481
- Hold up. Am I seeing Angie
Everett on a walk of shame?

00:57.520 --> 00:59.317
- I prefer "stride of pride".

00:59.360 --> 01:02.249
- Hard to be proud when
your shirt's on bacloNards.

01:02.290 --> 01:04.258
- Oh. Good one.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.225
- Dream on.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.763
- Seriously, you're
not gonna tell me?
- We're here on business.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.633
The client's waiting upstairs.
You're welcome, by the way.

01:12.670 --> 01:15.298
- Making you look good in there.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.471
- Please, you gotta
help me find her.
- Dex,

01:22.510 --> 01:25.775
when was the last time
you talked to your Sister?
- Yesterday, after school.

01:25.810 --> 01:28.517
I work nights at the Toronto
General Hospital.

01:28.550 --> 01:30.780
When I got home this morning,
around 6:30, Drea wasn't here.

01:30.820 --> 01:33.254
7 You and Drea
live here alone?

01:33.290 --> 01:37.283
- Our dad died a year ago.
I'm Drea's legal guardian.
- I'm sorry.

01:38.730 --> 01:42.120
Sometimes kids act out when they
lose a parent. She's 16, right?

01:42.170 --> 01:45.321
It sounds like fairly standard
teenage stuff--
- No way.

01:45.370 --> 01:48.498
When I took the job at
the hospital, me and Drea

01:48.540 --> 01:51.407
made a promise that we'd eat
breakfast together
every morning.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.432
She wouldn't miss it.
Not without calling.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.846
- If the police find out
about this,

01:56.880 --> 02:00.714
Children's Aid is gonna start
asking questions and
I just can't. Alright?

02:00.750 --> 02:03.913
Look, I know y'all can't work
for free, but how much time
can a hundred bucks get me?

02:03.950 --> 02:07.488
I just need some help
finding her.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.659
I got this from your dad.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.523
I helped him out a few years
back. He was cool. He said
he owed me one.

02:17.770 --> 02:21.490
- OK. Show me Drea's room.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.318
- Her backpack, some clothes.

02:32.350 --> 02:34.341
And her bed's still made,
so I know she didn't sleep
here last night.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.354
That's her demo CD.
She's a rapper.
- Is this her cell phone number

02:39.390 --> 02:42.826
on the back here?
- I've been calling smce I got
home this morning. No answer.

02:42.860 --> 02:47.490
- Maybe she left it somewhere.
- No way. Two things Drea can't
live without: her music

02:47.530 --> 02:49.669
and her phone.
- Well,

02:49.700 --> 02:52.931
let's hope she's still
got her music.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.502
- ** I see you and you see me

03:00.540 --> 03:04.909
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

03:04.950 --> 03:08.545
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:08.580 --> 03:10.719
* What my head overlooks

03:10.750 --> 03:14.356
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:14.390 --> 03:16.824
* When it's watching for lies

03:16.860 --> 03:19.328
* 'Cause you can't escape my

03:19.360 --> 03:21.419
* Private Eyes

03:21.460 --> 03:23.496
* They're watching you

03:23.530 --> 03:25.623
* Private Eyes

03:25.670 --> 03:27.831
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

03:27.870 --> 03:32.000
* Watching you *

03:32.040 --> 03:35.407
: Hopefully Drea's
phone can tell us something.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.840
No idea if this is gonna work,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.871
but at least it's instant rice.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.378
You know.
So it'll dry faster.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.517
Anything interesting?
- Well, I have figured out

03:47.560 --> 03:49.721
what Drea thinks is
"hashtag lame"

03:49.760 --> 03:52.251
and what gives her
"hashtag feels."

03:52.300 --> 03:55.497
- This kid is seriously
connected. Twitter,
Facebook, Vine.

03:55.530 --> 03:58.727
She posts every couple of hours.
What's that?

03:58.770 --> 04:03.332
Don't you know I'm a wolf?
Don't let my size fool you *

04:03.370 --> 04:06.407
* I'll cut you all with a hook
- Sick.
- Yeah.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.601
- "Keepin' it real at the OCC."

04:08.640 --> 04:11.473
- No, I know this.
I know this. It's Ontario. No.

04:11.510 --> 04:14.013
It's--
- Oakmills Community Centre.
- That's what I was gonna say.

04:14.050 --> 04:16.416
- You know this_isn't
a competition, right?

04:16.450 --> 04:18.645
But I nailed it.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.685
It's impossible to tell

04:23.730 --> 04:25.948
how old kids are these days.
Especially the girls.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.458
16 is the new 21.
- I don't know.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.821
I've scouted kids of all ages,
and I've got Jules.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.293
I can read the signs.
- OK,

04:33.340 --> 04:35.296
how old is she?

04:35.340 --> 04:38.036
- About 14.
- No way. 18 at least.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.732
- Maybe you should let me
take the lead in there.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.374
I'm pretty much
the teenager-whisperer.

04:43.410 --> 04:46.538
- I can guarantee that
Jules doesn't think that.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.344
- Really.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.450
- Yeah, we're looking
for Drea Grant. She around?

04:52.490 --> 04:55.482
- Drea's brother Dex hired us.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.626
He's worried about her.
She didn't come home last night.

04:58.660 --> 05:00.821
- That's not like Drea.
She's a good girl.

05:00.860 --> 05:03.397
- She hangs around here

05:03.430 --> 05:06.092
most of the time, freestyling.
D'you ask Kenny?

05:06.130 --> 05:08.360
- Her ex.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.005
Thinks he's Macklemore,
but he's really Mackle-less.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.372
She dumped him about a month
ago, and he keeps calling her.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.038
- Sounds like a romantic
who can't let go.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.548
- Can't let go of her talent,
more so. Drea's gonna make it,

05:18.580 --> 05:20.775
and Kenny wants to be
along for the ride.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.788
- Any idea where
we can find him?

05:22.820 --> 05:25.380
- No idea, and no, thank you.
Kenny's a hothead.

05:25.420 --> 05:28.412
I keep telling Drea
to just not take his calls,

05:28.460 --> 05:30.382
but she's so soft, man.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.648
She don't listen to me.

05:34.660 --> 05:37.390
- Thanks.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.999
- I've found
Kenny's Twitter page.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.838
It doesn't say much about him,
but I can call Maz.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.405
- Your brain,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.873
it's like a colander.
Everything just flows out.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.640
- I gotta drop
you off. I'm late.
- We're on the clock!

05:54.680 --> 05:57.979
- Kid gave us a hundred bucks.
We went into overtime like,

05:58.020 --> 06:00.454
three hours ago. I've gotta go
to Jules's school.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.458
She's playing Helena in
A Midsummer Night's Dream.

06:02.490 --> 06:04.879
I told her I'd drop off
the bench from the baclqard.

06:04.930 --> 06:07.125
- Alright, I'll meet you back
at the office when you're done.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.561
_ I'm sure I'll have more
Information on Kenny by then.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.068
What is it about
girls and bad boys?

06:13.100 --> 06:16.399
- You tell me. Were you
and your bad boy

06:16.440 --> 06:18.761
feeling a little regret
this morning?

06:24.650 --> 06:27.448
Look, Dad, I have no proof,

06:27.480 --> 06:29.516
but a slq-high leather skirt
isn't appropriate work attire,

06:29.550 --> 06:31.211
right?
- Depends on the job.

06:31.250 --> 06:34.788
- She doesn't just flash those
kneecaps for everyone. Trust me,
I've been keeping track.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.823
- I'm a PI now, Dad.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.090
I've got a stronger
sense of curiosity.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.621
- Uh-huh.
Bit of advice, son?

06:44.970 --> 06:47.188
Mixing business and personal
is never a good idea.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.538
- The partnership you have

06:49.570 --> 06:52.937
with Angie is still new.
And I've seen you make
this mistake before,

06:52.980 --> 06:55.471
getting interested
in women you work with.

06:55.510 --> 06:57.705
- I'm not interested! I'm just--

06:57.750 --> 06:59.741
- Curious, yeah, I know.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.748
All I'm saying is,

07:01.780 --> 07:04.715
keep your eye on the prize,
not on her... kneecaps.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.694
- Good morrow to you,
quaint wench!

07:12.730 --> 07:14.698
- Well, you just confirmed

07:14.730 --> 07:16.994
I got the acting gene from Mom.
- You got her looks from her,
too,

07:17.030 --> 07:19.590
thankfully. Break a leg, honey.
I'll see you at home.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.198
- I thought you were
staying for rehearsal?

07:21.240 --> 07:25.461
- I gotta get back. Besides, why
watch an exhibition game
when you've got tickets

07:25.510 --> 07:27.137
to the playoffs?
Hey, honey,

07:27.180 --> 07:31.844
this case I'm working on,
it's about a missing kid.
She posted ten times a day,

07:31.880 --> 07:34.519
and then last night, she dropped
her phone into a fish tank

07:34.550 --> 07:38.247
and hasn't been online since.
Any tips on finding a teenager
who's gone off the grid?

07:38.290 --> 07:41.612
- Dad, phone or no phone,
we're never off the grid.

07:41.660 --> 07:45.152
Just because she hasn't
posted online doesn't mean
she hasn't been online.

07:45.190 --> 07:48.057
- Right. You're a genius, honey.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.319
Love you, baby.
- See you later.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.237
- Of course.
Maz must be Mazhari.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.535
Maz.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.548
- Shade, perfect timing.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.208
It's tough work trying
to pull your weight.
- Still nothing.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.071
- You're really counting on that
being instant rice, aren't ya?

08:09.120 --> 08:12.510
- So, I pulled the case file
on Drea's ex-boyfriend.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.653
Looks like Kenny's got a bit
of an anger management problem.

08:14.690 --> 08:17.022
- He's been busted six times
for disorderlies.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.528
- There's a work address on
here, we should go check it out.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.858
- OK. Thanks, Maz.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.494
I'll grab my coat.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.196
- You guys have been friends
for a long time,

08:29.240 --> 08:32.300
right?
- Yeah, we go back.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.228
Our dads were cops
at the same time.
- Right.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.078
Were you guys like
besties, or...?

08:37.110 --> 08:40.819
- More like Bonnie and Clyde.
Yeah, we got into a lot
of trouble.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.751
Whew.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.315
- Yeah, I guess I got
caught in my memory palace

08:49.360 --> 08:51.089
for a little while.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.588
Alright, see you guys.
- Yeah, I'm sure we will.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.107
- Thank you.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.614
- He's 16. Everybody works
at a place like this.

09:13.650 --> 09:16.073
* If you want a burger,
then look no further *

09:16.120 --> 09:17.747
* We won't even chastise

09:17.790 --> 09:21.282
* If you wanna add fries
And it won't break the bank
If you wanna get a drank *

09:21.320 --> 09:23.720
[Whoo! This is Kenny.
Can I help you

09:23.760 --> 09:26.854
- Uh, yeah, I'll have
a Majesty Burger combo,

09:26.900 --> 09:29.664
but instead of relish
I'll take pickles, a sesame bun

09:29.700 --> 09:31.998
instead of plain, hold
the onions, add hot peppers,

09:32.030 --> 09:34.294
and put the special sauce
on the side. What do you want?

09:36.270 --> 09:39.262
- I'll have a number one.

09:39.310 --> 09:42.768
[for that special order.
That a'ight
- Oh, no problem.

09:42.810 --> 09:45.608
- That order_ was more intricate
than my divorce settlement.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.244
- Special orders

09:48.280 --> 09:51.283
take longer to prepare, so the
employees ask you to pull over
and someone brings it out.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.379
- You used
to sling fast food.

09:53.420 --> 09:56.628
- No! Maybe. I was 16.

09:56.660 --> 09:59.754
- Look, here he comes.
- Sorry for the delay.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.291
Hope you have a nice day.

10:02.330 --> 10:05.322
- We're looking for Drea.

10:05.370 --> 10:08.828
You seen her today?
- Not talking to you, homes.
- We've seen your police record,

10:08.870 --> 10:11.805
Kenny. You don't want to add
obstruction to the list.
- Hold up.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.298
You guys are cops?
- Tell us if you've seen Drea,
or we can all take a ride.

10:16.380 --> 10:19.247
- In a squad car
that we will call.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.817
- I was with her last night.

10:21.850 --> 10:24.045
She was trying to get
her demo into The Six.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.183
- It's slang for Toronto.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.757
- It's also a hip-hop event
downtown at a club.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.758
Two days, the best emcees,

10:30.790 --> 10:32.758
best DJs, and it's
hosted by Apollo.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.257
- Apollo is like
the hottest thing--
- I know who Apollo is!

10:35.300 --> 10:38.167
Yeah, so you went
to the club, and?
- The bouncer didn't let me in.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.622
But Drea gave him
a little cutie eye,

10:39.670 --> 10:42.901
next thing I know she's walking
in and kicking me straight
to the curb.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.498
Don't let that
good-girl act fool you.

10:44.540 --> 10:48.306
Drea wanted Apollo to hear
her stuff. She wouldn't let
anybody get in her way.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.102
I gotta work, yo.

10:52.150 --> 10:55.415
- 16-year-old girl
in a nightclub?
That doesn't sound good.

10:55.450 --> 10:58.442
- I went to clubs when I was 16.
- And look at you now.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.884
- Instant rice.
What did I tell you?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.839
Uh-oh.
- The last text message Drea got

11:12.870 --> 11:14.838
was at 2:47 AM.

11:14.870 --> 11:17.361
"I know how to find you.
Talk and you're dead."

11:24.280 --> 11:27.215
- Drea must be really serious
about her music to take
a flyer on getting

11:27.250 --> 11:29.377
into this club.
- Well, let's hope
someone remembers her,

11:29.420 --> 11:31.741
because this is
the only lead we've got.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.850
- Follow me.

11:37.890 --> 11:40.051
- Wouldn't want
my 16-year-old gIrl In here.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.991
- Sorry, guys. Private event.
- Hey, I'm Matt Shade. You might
know me as "Shadow".

11:45.130 --> 11:47.769
Not a hockey fan?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.267
- Just say it.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.007
- You might know me
from my Epic Fail video?

11:52.040 --> 11:54.508
"Shadow Sounds Off"?

11:54.540 --> 11:57.976
- Shadow!
That video kills me, man.

11:58.010 --> 12:02.379
When you figured out your mic
was still on, you made
a face like--

12:03.520 --> 12:07.081
- Always nice to meet a fan.
So, can we...?

12:07.120 --> 12:09.259
- Absolutely. Just check your
coats and your cell phones
over there.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.919
- Just make that face again.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.503
- I can't believe we had
to check our cell phones.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.508
I feel so naked.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.340
- And you're wearing twice the
clothing you wore this morning.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.420
- What can I get
for you, beautiful?

12:44.460 --> 12:47.452
- I'll have a beer. Nothing
for him. He's in recovery.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.363
We're on a budget.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.937
Listen, I lost my purse
here last night.

12:54.970 --> 12:57.359
Has my entire life in it. Is
there someone I could talk to?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.207
- Try Johnny.
He's head of security,

12:59.240 --> 13:01.504
in charge of everything
lost or conﬁscated in here.

13:01.540 --> 13:04.043
- You're the best.
- You have no idea.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.072
- Dude. I'm standing right here.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.282
- Please. Give me some credit.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.195
- Sorry, had to ask.

13:21.230 --> 13:23.391
That's not_ even the weirdest
thing In here.

13:23.430 --> 13:26.092
- Ugh, it's not here. Dammit!

13:26.130 --> 13:28.234
It had all of my
credit cards, my IDs...

13:28.270 --> 13:32.331
- Maybe it was stolen, baby.
- Good point, honey.

13:32.370 --> 13:34.338
Could you show us
the security footage

13:34.380 --> 13:38.441
from last night?
- I can't show just anyone the
footage. Privacy laws, right?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.448
- We wouldn't tell anyone.
- I'll tell you what.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.517
I'll take a look at it; if I see
anything, I'll let you know.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.217
This isn't
about a purse.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.626
We're actually looking for
a missing girl. Drea Grant.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.356
We know she was here last night.
- Look, guys, I'm sorry.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.925
About the girl--really, I am,
but I can't help you.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.565
- Wait. They were checking
cell phones at the door tonight,

13:58.600 --> 14:00.568
which means no photos, no video.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.036
- You can't show us security
footage because it
doesn't exist.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.646
Apollo requested all the cameras
be turned off both nights.

14:11.680 --> 14:15.218
Inside and outside.
The Six event draws
a lot of celebrities.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.218
- And they want to have
a good time without worrying

14:17.250 --> 14:20.083
it's gonna end up on TMZ.

14:22.930 --> 14:27.355
- No security footage means
we need to talk to someone
who was here last nIght.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.563
- Kenny said Drea was determined
to get her CD to Apollo...

14:30.600 --> 14:34.092
: Hey, Apollo!
- We should go ask him
if he remembers her.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.904
- We can't just go question
Apollo. We have to be cool.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.238
- Looks like we've been made.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.238
Yo, what up, man?

14:41.280 --> 14:44.078
Been a huge fan for years. I
miss seeing you on the ice, man.

14:44.110 --> 14:47.648
- Hey, thanks, Apollo. This is
my friend, Angie Everett.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.240
- Angie Everett.
- I already said that.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.349
- I love you. I mean your music.

14:52.390 --> 14:55.109
- Thank you.
- That was smooth.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.129
- Did you happen to see
this girl last night?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.321
- Oh yeah,

15:00.360 --> 15:03.124
DJ Luclq introduced us.
I remember the hat.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.492
- Nah, he didn't
make it in tonight.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.135
I think I know why.

15:09.170 --> 15:12.298
- Charmaine happened.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.201
- She tried to step to my man.
I showed up last night

15:17.250 --> 15:20.378
and this fast-ass chick was
all up on Luclq, so I had
to let her know.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.344
- That no one touches
my man but me.

15:23.390 --> 15:27.383
You get it, right? I mean, what
would you do if you saw some
girl pushing up on your man?

15:27.420 --> 15:29.456
And me? No.

15:29.490 --> 15:31.629
Uh, no. No way.

15:31.660 --> 15:35.357
- A simple "we just work
together" would suffice.
- We just work together.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.188
- Well, I don't work with this
girl. I never seen her
before in my life.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.698
So we got into it a little bit.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.538
She didn't back down,
I'll give her that.

15:44.570 --> 15:47.437
- That fool took off as_ soon
as he saw me coming.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.576
He knew he was wrong. I haven't
seen or talked to him since.

15:55.250 --> 15:58.413
When _I realized that she wasn't
gomg anywhere, I called
a bouncer over.

15:58.450 --> 16:02.489
- Even better. He kicked
her ass out

16:02.520 --> 16:04.488
the back door.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.236
: What exactly
are we looking for?

16:14.270 --> 16:16.693
- I dunno. Itjust
seemed appropriate.
- We're looking for clues

16:16.740 --> 16:19.459
about where Drea went
after she got kicked out.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.323
This doesn't look good.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.568
- You're not gonna try to arrest
me again, are you, Detective?

17:17.600 --> 17:20.296
- You don't wanna get arrested,
stop getting caught
with dead bodies.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.229
So you're telling me you just
went out back for a smoke?

17:23.270 --> 17:26.239
- Bad habit, I know.

17:26.270 --> 17:29.831
- You could, except I quit.
Tonight. When I went outside,
actually. I thought to myself,

17:29.880 --> 17:33.418
this is disgusting. I went to
throw the pack, and that's
when I found the body.

17:33.450 --> 17:36.248
- DJ Lucky,
isn't it?

17:36.280 --> 17:38.544
- We know he was

17:38.590 --> 17:42.117
the regular DJ here,
and he didn't show up tonight.
What do you think happened?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.549
- I'm not seeing
your police badge.
- Come on, Detective.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.729
It's gonna be in all the papers
tomorrow morning.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.752
- What's so hard
about telling us?
- Yeah, looks like Luclq.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.621
Took two to the chest.
No cash or jewellery on him.

17:52.670 --> 17:55.594
And so far, no murder weapon.
- So it looks like a robbery.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.767
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.370
- Crime scene thinks 24 hours.
Look, for the record,

18:00.410 --> 18:03.243
so I can write you off
as a suspect, do you have
an alibi for last night?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.748
- Yeah, Angie, where
were you last night?

18:05.780 --> 18:09.614
- Come on. You don't seriously
think I had something to do
with DJ Luclq?

18:09.650 --> 18:12.346
- Smoking is the gateway drug
to a lot of bad behaviour.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.278
- Smoking and miniskirts.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.288
- Yeah, she was wearing
a miniskirt.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.155
- I gotta get in there!
- Club is closed, man.
- I gotta-- Move, man!

18:25.700 --> 18:29.431
- I was trying to be proactive!
Hey, hey, whoa, Johnny, Johnny--

18:29.470 --> 18:31.199
- Remember the missing girl
we told you about?
This is her brother.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.279
- Police said nobody comes
or goes until they're finished.
- We just gave our statement.

18:35.310 --> 18:38.370
We'll take him.
- Get off me, man.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.686
- Just over there.
- Drea loves that hat.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.654
She would not leave it
unless she had to.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.783
- That's not all we found.

18:53.530 --> 18:57.318
I don't understand.
- We think Drea might have
witnessed DJ Luclq's murder.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.396
It's possible
the killer knows it.

19:16.650 --> 19:19.813
- First you don't tell Nolan
the real reason we're there.

19:19.850 --> 19:22.956
Then you take Drea's hat
from the crime scene
and give it to Dex.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.949
What's going on?
- Dex doesn't want the cops
to know Drea's missing. Not yet.

19:26.990 --> 19:30.460
- I know your dad may have made
Dex a promise, but you didn't.

19:32.730 --> 19:36.291
Angie, this is bigger
than a runaway teenager.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.763
Someone got killed.

19:38.810 --> 19:42.576
- After my dad died,
I tried to clean up his office.

19:42.610 --> 19:45.374
_ Take over
his unfinished cases,

19:45.410 --> 19:48.140
put away his files,
things like that. But...

19:52.020 --> 19:54.352
- It was like saying goodbye
to him all over again.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.352
- When Dex pulled out
my dad's card this morning...

19:59.390 --> 20:01.426
I don't know, I just...

20:01.460 --> 20:03.792
It felt like I was working
a case with him again.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.969
- Do you know how Dex
helped your father?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.968
- No.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.831
But my dad had good insight
into people,

20:13.880 --> 20:17.338
and if he owed Dex a favour,
it means he believed him.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.818
- Then I guess we'd
better find Drea.

20:21.850 --> 20:23.886
For both their sakes.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.391
- OK, Dad, let's hear
what you have to say.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.903
- [How do you know
Dexter Grant
- Come on, Everett.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.009
- My dad knew him.

20:53.050 --> 20:56.269
- [Well, he's got a juvie
record for robbery.]

20:56.320 --> 20:58.948
That doesn't
make any sense.

20:58.990 --> 21:02.380
Dex said he helped
my dad with a case.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.729
but Lucky's murder could've been
a robbery gone wrong.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.524
- I can't tell you anything.
Client-PI privilege.

21:07.560 --> 21:11.792
- Oh, so he's a client.
- Breaking up!

21:16.440 --> 21:19.534
- Stand back in awe
at the power of my celebrity.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.938
Actually, get up, let's move,
we've got a poker game.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.948
- Still night for some people.
More importantly,

21:25.980 --> 21:27.948
I figured out
how we can find Drea.

21:27.980 --> 21:31.484
We're going to Apollo's
poker game. You know
how to play, right?

21:31.520 --> 21:34.318
- Uh, my dad had a regular game.
But me? No.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.420
'Cause you totally
seem like the kind of girl
who'd know how to--

21:37.460 --> 21:40.429
You're bluffing.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.335
- Oh, come on!

21:53.810 --> 21:56.574
Gimme something good!

21:59.880 --> 22:02.348
- Alright, Negreanu.

22:02.380 --> 22:05.986
- Let me guess--
you've got another bad hand?
- Gotta know when to fold 'em.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.659
- You've been running on lucky.
- It's like you're a
professional or something.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.955
- Yeah, back in the day, man.
- You don't make 30 mil
without some skills.

22:11.990 --> 22:14.458
Daniel knows how
to read 'em. I'm out.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.024
- What have I been telling you
all these years? It's
just luck, man.

22:16.060 --> 22:19.461
- I gotta turn my luck around.
- Yeah, you've been running bad.
- Yeah, I have.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.365
If it wasn't
for back luck...

22:21.400 --> 22:23.937
- Yeah.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.632
Watch this. I'm so lucky
I'm gonna bet this too.

22:28.810 --> 22:31.643
- Yeah, I'mma let you two
work this out.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.409
- Good decision.

22:38.150 --> 22:41.085
I'm gonna raise.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.749
- Yeah. I think you've got
a monster there. No way
you're gonna fold.

22:52.830 --> 22:56.459
- I've seen many a trap in my
day. Not falling for this one.

22:59.970 --> 23:02.473
- Wow.

23:02.510 --> 23:06.549
- Alright, let's go get a drink.
- Good call.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.514
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.
- Ha, ha!

23:08.550 --> 23:10.518
And here I thought
I brought the ringer.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.518
- Would you excuse us
for one second?

23:12.550 --> 23:15.189
Look, normally
I play nice,

23:15.220 --> 23:18.587
but today I brought my A-game
for a reason. We need a favour.

23:18.630 --> 23:21.190
- Do you remember that girl
we asked you about last night,
from the CD?

23:21.230 --> 23:24.859
She's missing. We think
she might have witnessed
Luclq's murder at the club.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.835
- I'm sorry to hear that.

23:27.870 --> 23:31.806
You've got over a million
followers. That could
really help us out.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.479
- We understand teenagers

23:34.510 --> 23:36.478
never really go off the grid.

23:36.510 --> 23:39.172
- We'd like your Twitter feed
to host a contest.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.708
- Apollo let you use
his Twitter account?
- Uh-huh.

23:46.750 --> 23:50.459
- Dad, this is literally
the first time you've
ever been cool.

23:50.490 --> 23:53.823
I think.

23:53.860 --> 23:56.454
So, Apollo already
posted the tweet,

23:56.500 --> 23:58.764
so just keep an ear
out for the replies.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.463
- "Finish the lyric correctly,
win a guest verse on his
next track." Got it.

24:02.500 --> 24:05.799
- The lyric is from Drea's CD,
so she'll be the only one
who can answer correctly.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.230
Once she replies, we'll be able
to track her location.
If she replies.

24:09.280 --> 24:13.205
- No way she'd pass up a guest
verse on Apollo's next track.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.219
You know, if you want me
to keep helping, I can
always miss the play.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.844
- Jules._ You've been
rehearsmg for weeks.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.518
You're ready.
- At least I won't be able

24:21.560 --> 24:23.528
to see everyone staring at me
if I forget my lines.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.926
- That's what you're worried
about

24:25.960 --> 24:28.258
- You and Mom,

24:28.300 --> 24:31.167
you were both so amazing at what
you did. You made it look easy.
- Honey,

24:31.200 --> 24:35.239
if there's one thing your mother
and I agree on, it's that you
got the best of both of us.

24:35.270 --> 24:38.262
She lit up every room
she ever walked into,

24:38.310 --> 24:42.098
and I love pressure.
You're gonna be great.

24:42.140 --> 24:45.041
- Trust me.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.809
You got this.

24:46.850 --> 24:49.910
- There's more responses
coming in.

24:49.950 --> 24:52.885
- [I do this for you.
The dream is the only thing]

24:52.920 --> 24:56.788
[I have left. That's why
I tell the world]

24:56.820 --> 24:58.788
- That automated voice

24:58.830 --> 25:00.798
is even more annoying
than the GPS chick.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.821
Headphones, please.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.101
[Couple of juvenile arrests.
The kid gave me what I needed,]

25:19.150 --> 25:21.118
[Said he wanted to turn
his life around.]

25:28.920 --> 25:32.128
- Oh, here's another one:
"I do this for you.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.993
"The dream is the only thing
I have left. That's why

25:35.030 --> 25:37.294
I keep on pushing,
keep moving Through
the Wire like Kanye West."

25:37.330 --> 25:39.195
- Yeah, that's Drea's lyric.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.997
"Call Angie."

25:46.310 --> 25:48.870
- Yeah, I've got it!

25:48.910 --> 25:51.902
- Nice. Nice.
All we need to do now

25:51.950 --> 25:54.646
is track the IP address and then
we can see if we can find Drea.

25:57.250 --> 26:00.185
but Frankie can.
- I've never met _
anyone named Frankie.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.279
- There's a lot of people
in my life you've never met.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.357
[I'll call you back when I hear,
you can swing by.]

26:05.390 --> 26:07.950
- You think "Frankie"
is, like, short

26:08.000 --> 26:10.059
for Frances? Or more
of a nickname for Frank?

26:10.100 --> 26:13.228
- Dad, get a grip.
- OK.

26:18.340 --> 26:21.173
: Drea's IP was found
coming from an East Side caf.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.147
Public computer. Child's play.

26:32.190 --> 26:35.250
- I suppose "Frankie"
hooked you up?
- Just hope Drea's still here.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.622
Drea, wait!
- Drea, stop!
- Stop!

26:40.660 --> 26:42.321
Drea, wait!

26:42.360 --> 26:45.193
- Take it easy!
- Dex sent us.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.266
Where is he?

26:47.300 --> 26:50.133
- We'll take you to him.
Just get in the car.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.786
Dex still_isn't
answering his phone.

27:06.820 --> 27:10.119
- So, let's start
with something easy.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.926
Like where you got the gun.
- I found it.

27:13.960 --> 27:17.919
- Nah, on the street.
Someone must've dropped it,
so I picked it up.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.768
"I know how to find you.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.759
Talk and you're dead."
- Found it in your fish tank.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.234
Stuck it in a bag of rice.
- Come on, Drea. We know

27:28.280 --> 27:30.236
you were at the club.
You got kicked out,

27:30.280 --> 27:32.248
went home, changed your clothes
and dumped your phone.

27:32.280 --> 27:36.649
- What we don't_ know is
who you're running from.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.741
- If you don't talk to us,
we can't help you.

27:39.790 --> 27:42.258
- Just take me home. Dex is
working, he'll be back soon.

27:42.290 --> 27:44.679
- That text message
scared you enough

27:44.730 --> 27:46.880
to send you running.
You sure you wanna go home?

27:46.930 --> 27:49.251
- I can take care of myself.

27:56.270 --> 27:59.706
- She's hiding something.
Besides the freaking
murder weapon.

27:59.740 --> 28:03.870
Do you think it's possible?
No way. Luclq helped her.

28:03.910 --> 28:05.878
He got her CD to Apollo,

28:05.910 --> 28:07.946
she's not gonna kill him.
Aanay, we're not even sure

28:07.980 --> 28:09.277
that's the murder weapon.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.709
- So, you think
she's protecting someone?
- You saw that text.

28:11.750 --> 28:14.753
She's protecting herself.
She's a good kid.

28:14.790 --> 28:16.951
She's scared out of her mind.
- OK, fine,

28:16.990 --> 28:20.323
but if she doesn't talk soon,
we'll have no choice but to take
her and the gun to the cops.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.488
- Right.
Jules's play. I gotta go.

28:23.530 --> 28:27.159
- OK, go. Wait. Take Drea
with you. You've got a kid,
maybe you'll have better luck

28:27.200 --> 28:29.737
getting her to talk.

28:29.770 --> 28:32.102
- I'll call Maz, see if he can
tell us the caliber of the gun

28:32.140 --> 28:34.404
that killed Lucky.
- OK. Keep trying Dex.

28:36.240 --> 28:40.301
Hey, wanna go see a play about
a dream in the summertime--

28:40.350 --> 28:43.740
- No, I don't want--
- Just come on. Come.
- I don't do plays. I--

28:49.990 --> 28:51.924
- With duty and desire,

28:51.960 --> 28:54.099
we follow you.

28:56.060 --> 28:59.268
- No. But you see that guy
sitting in the front?

28:59.300 --> 29:01.336
Grey hair, aura of judgment?

29:01.370 --> 29:04.430
That's my dad.
- So why aren't you
sitting with him?

29:04.470 --> 29:07.530
- He doesn't love it
when I'm late.

29:07.570 --> 29:09.834
- No way. You're like 50,

29:09.880 --> 29:13.179
and you're still scared
of your Dad.
- I am not...

29:13.210 --> 29:15.917
50.

29:15.950 --> 29:19.215
- So that thing with Apollo,

29:19.250 --> 29:21.218
that contest. _
That was just a scam, right?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.251
- Yeah. He was
helping us find you.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.960
But he listened to your CD.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.969
He said he liked
your lyrics.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.037
Is that song
about your dad?

29:37.070 --> 29:40.801
- I dunno. Maybe.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.569
- Keep promise, love.

29:42.610 --> 29:45.909
Look, here comes Helena.
- Wait, here she comes.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.218
- Teach me how you look,

29:50.250 --> 29:52.946
and with what art you sway
the motion of Demetrius' heart.

29:52.990 --> 29:56.016
- She had to make her drama
teacher adapt the character
to be blind.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.325
- Shh... just watch.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.193
- Oh, that your frowns would
teach my smiles such skill!

30:46.640 --> 30:49.108
Hey, Jules. Ah!
- Hey.

30:49.140 --> 30:52.405
- You were amazing.
I am so proud of you.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.418
- You know, I have my ways.

30:54.450 --> 30:57.317
And to tell you the truth,
we were a little late,

30:57.350 --> 30:59.386
but this is why.

30:59.420 --> 31:02.218
Jules, this is Drea.
- Oh, hi!

31:02.260 --> 31:03.887
I hope you're OK.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.319
- Yeah, I'm all right.
You were good.

31:06.360 --> 31:09.193
- Thanks. I loved your demo.
I've got to go,

31:09.230 --> 31:12.427
my monologue's in this act.
See you after?
- OK, honey.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.438
You bet.

31:14.470 --> 31:17.189
- Your kid seems nice.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.367
- She's the light of my life.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.334
I'm sure your dad felt
the same way about you.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.345
I know Dex does.

31:26.380 --> 31:29.019
- After I got
kicked out of the club,

31:29.050 --> 31:31.211
he was the first
person I thought of.

31:31.250 --> 31:33.138
Dex always has my back.

31:33.190 --> 31:35.658
- Tell me what happened.

31:37.660 --> 31:40.185
You saw something.

31:44.300 --> 31:47.019
- The bouncer threw me out.

31:47.070 --> 31:48.958
I heard a bang.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.968
Then another.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.205
I knew what it was,
so I found a place to hide.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.208
After a few minutes,

31:57.240 --> 32:01.017
some guy ran by me
back into the club.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.184
- It was pretty dark.

32:05.220 --> 32:07.279
Once he was gone,

32:07.320 --> 32:09.379
I ran over, thought
maybe I could help.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.228
It was DJ Luclq.

32:13.260 --> 32:14.955
He wasn't moving,
bleeding everywhere...

32:15.000 --> 32:19.721
I was gonna call the police.
But then the guy -the shooter-
he must've forgotten something.

32:19.770 --> 32:23.262
- He came back.
- I saw the gun on the ground.

32:23.300 --> 32:27.304
He was coming towards me
so... I picked it up.

32:27.340 --> 32:30.571
I told him to stay away,
and then I ran.

32:30.610 --> 32:33.249
- So when you got
that text message,

32:33.280 --> 32:35.475
you knew it was from
the guy who shot Luclq.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.011
- He must have found
one of my CDs.

32:38.050 --> 32:42.089
I put everything on the back. My
number, my email, my address...

32:42.120 --> 32:43.758
I knew I couldn't
stay at home

32:43.790 --> 32:47.521
so I picked up
my stuff and I left.

32:56.200 --> 33:00.204
- There you are! Thank God!
We found Drea, she's ﬁne.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.538
- No, she's with Shade. Come on.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.468
- Love can transpose
to form and dignity.

33:07.510 --> 33:10.172
Love looks not with the eyes
but with the mind.

33:10.220 --> 33:12.438
And therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.414
Nor hath Love's mind

33:15.460 --> 33:18.281
of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes

33:18.330 --> 33:20.582
figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love

33:20.630 --> 33:23.053
said to be a child.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.193
- It's Dex. He's outside.

33:25.230 --> 33:28.165
- Tell him we'll be
out in five minutes.
- It's alright, I'll go see him.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.134
- No, Dex can wait four minutes.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.308
- Not a good time.
Terrible time.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.217
- OK, but Dex is here
and he wants to see Drea.

33:41.250 --> 33:45.118
- Tell him we'll be
out in three minutes.
No, we're at the agency.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.118
- Dex is here.
He just texted Drea,

33:47.150 --> 33:49.482
- Shade,

33:49.520 --> 33:52.387
Dex lost his phone today.
That's why he wasn't answering.
That text wasn't from him.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.304
- Drea!!

34:12.480 --> 34:15.415
Charmaine, Drea's been taken.
- Y'all called me

34:15.450 --> 34:19.113
saying you had information about
who killed Luclq, and now you're
throwin' this in my face?!

34:19.150 --> 34:21.857
- 9mm. Same as the gun
that killed Lucky.

34:21.890 --> 34:25.428
And marked with the exact same
symbol as your necklace.

34:25.460 --> 34:28.156
- Drea said a guy killed Luclq,
and she found that gun

34:28.200 --> 34:30.350
next to the body.
We know you're in on it.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.595
- I'm not in on anything.

34:32.630 --> 34:34.598
A few months ago, I was attacked

34:34.640 --> 34:36.596
in the parking lot at the club.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.767
Luclq gave me that gun
for protection.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.766
- That's a great story.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.176
Still doesn't explain how
it ended up beside his body.

34:43.210 --> 34:45.178
- Somebody stole it!

34:45.210 --> 34:47.701
From my purse.
The same night, at the club.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.548
- And you didn't think about
telling that to the police?
- Yeah, sure.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.616
I shoulda just rolled up
to the cops, like: hey,

34:52.650 --> 34:55.585
my unregistered gun was stolen
the same night my boyfriend
was murdered.

34:55.620 --> 34:58.657
How you think that will go over?
- About as well as it's
g0ing over right now,

34:58.690 --> 35:01.158
but it might've saved Drea
from being kidnapped.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.260
- Her brother's out there
looking for her right now.
He's worried sick.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.291
- I had nothing to do with that,

35:06.330 --> 35:08.332
or with killing Luclq.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.730
Luclq was the love of my life.

35:14.710 --> 35:17.338
I wanted to be with him,
more than anyone, ever.

35:18.710 --> 35:21.770
I even broke off my engagement
with Johnny for him.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.709
Head of security
at the club, Johnny?

35:24.750 --> 35:27.844
- We used to be together, and...

35:27.890 --> 35:31.678
then I started hanging out
with Lucky and...

35:31.730 --> 35:34.654
we just had a connection,
you know?

35:35.830 --> 35:38.390
- Johnny knew the cameras were
turned off. He also probably
knew that Charmaine

35:38.430 --> 35:41.331
carried that gun in her purse.
- And when we found the body,

35:41.370 --> 35:44.703
when I called Dex to come down
to the club, Johnny grabbed him.
He could have taken Dex's phone

35:44.740 --> 35:47.208
- Which he used to text Drea,
to get her outside.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.539
- Wait, you're saying
Johnny's got her?

35:54.480 --> 35:56.675
- You got this, Charmaine.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.745
- Yeah, so I can
track his position.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.717
It's me, Charmaine.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.183
I need to talk to you.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.391
No, it's important.
- Say you made a mistake
when you chose Luclq.

36:08.430 --> 36:12.218
- I made a mistake,
choosing Lucky over you.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.860
Why did I do it? Uh...

36:15.900 --> 36:18.334
- Say you were confused.
- You were being impulsive.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.838
- Uh, you know me, Johnny,

36:20.870 --> 36:23.338
I just wild out like that
sometimes.

36:23.380 --> 36:26.247
The thing is, now
that Luclq's gone...

36:26.280 --> 36:29.374
- You realize he's the one.
- You couldn't see what was
right in front of you.

36:33.550 --> 36:36.758
Nothing, baby, I was
just talking to... the TV.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.286
I said it was nothing.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.691
You know what? You're right,
there is someone here.

36:45.730 --> 36:48.563
The police.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.899
Yeah, that's right, and now
they're coming for your ass.
Tracking Dex's phone,

36:51.940 --> 36:55.671
you dummy. I hope
you have fun in jail!

36:58.310 --> 37:01.916
Should I call him back?

37:03.820 --> 37:05.913
- You know what's
around there?

37:05.950 --> 37:07.918
- I think I know
where they are.

37:07.950 --> 37:11.625
Two blocks up, turn left.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.332
Stay here, wait for the cops.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.844
- Let's split up.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.713
- I won't say anything!
- Shut up!

37:37.750 --> 37:40.947
- Please, you have to let me go!
I won't tell anyone, I swear!

37:40.990 --> 37:43.379
- You already did!
- I won't say anything!

37:43.420 --> 37:46.583
- You could've just walked past
Luclq, and none of this
would've happened!

37:48.060 --> 37:50.324
- Why don't you
put your gun away?
- Hey, stay back, man!

37:54.070 --> 37:56.630
- Johnny, let me see
if I got this straight.

37:56.670 --> 37:59.468
- Stay back, man, I mean it!
- First, you shoot Luclq.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.899
And Drea sees you,
so now you gotta shoot her.

38:01.940 --> 38:05.046
Come on, Johnny. Where does it
end
- I get out of town tonight,

38:05.080 --> 38:07.002
I got a fifty-fifty chance.

38:07.050 --> 38:10.542
- Come on, man, I get it.
Charmaine dumps you,

38:10.580 --> 38:13.083
and now all you've got
is some crap security job

38:13.120 --> 38:15.759
at the club with a front-row
seat to watch them together.

38:15.790 --> 38:19.726
You snapped.
- Me and Charmaine...
we had plans!

38:19.760 --> 38:21.853
Luclq stole that from me.
From us!

38:21.900 --> 38:24.425
Ah!

38:28.370 --> 38:32.067
- It's OK. It's OK.
I've got you.

38:32.110 --> 38:35.375
Take it easy.

38:35.410 --> 38:37.435
- It's OK.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.090
- You Everetts
are good people, man.

39:00.130 --> 39:03.463
- I'm glad you called in
that favour.
- Hey,

39:03.500 --> 39:07.038
this is Apollo's
personal number.

39:07.070 --> 39:10.870
- I told you. He likes your CD.
He wants to work with you
in his studio.

39:13.180 --> 39:15.876
- Thank you.
I'll never forget this.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.388
- Take care.
- Thank you.

39:21.420 --> 39:24.059
- So you know Nolan's gonna
rip you both a new one
tonight, right?

39:24.090 --> 39:26.149
- I don't think he will.

39:26.190 --> 39:28.750
It's a good collar.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.496
- Alright. Extra-hot,

39:31.530 --> 39:34.658
milk, no sugar.
- Thank you.

39:34.700 --> 39:37.066
- Hey, sorry,

39:37.100 --> 39:40.399
I didn't know
how you took yours.
- Yeah, that's alright.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.801
He's your mystery man.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.478
- You're obsessed!
- Oh, come on. He feeds you
information,

39:47.510 --> 39:50.809
he comes over when he could've
called, he definitely knows
how you take your coffee.

39:50.850 --> 39:52.511
- Maz and I have known
each other forever.

39:52.550 --> 39:54.689
- Must've been 20 years
of foreplay.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.086
- After my dad died,
Maz used to give me cases

39:57.120 --> 40:00.749
when business was slow.
I couldn't have gone
through it without him.

40:00.790 --> 40:04.590
- Sounds like you're close.
- We are.
- Close friends.

40:04.630 --> 40:06.564
Maybe that's why you two
have never hooked up.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.091
- Exactly.
- Or you're bluffing.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.962
- Fine. Keep it to yourself.
One last question.

40:13.010 --> 40:15.137
You had time. You could've
gone home and changed

40:15.180 --> 40:17.205
out of that miniskirt before
you met me at the barbershop.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.606
- That's not a question.

40:19.650 --> 40:22.676
- That's what I thought.

40:24.720 --> 40:28.178
- * Wild child

40:28.220 --> 40:31.109
* Where will you go?

40:36.000 --> 40:39.163
* I can see in your eyes

40:41.640 --> 40:45.531
* Someone's done you harm

40:50.210 --> 40:53.099
* Run far from here

40:56.280 --> 40:59.784
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Dad! I thought you were
coming to the after-party.

40:59.820 --> 41:02.084
- Yeah, you should've told me
you were gonna watch

41:02.120 --> 41:04.782
from the wings, I would've
invited a lady friend.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.928
- Wow.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.827
- You heard _the
monologue, right?
- It was great.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.896
- Yeah, except I messed up.
- Hardly noticed.

41:17.170 --> 41:20.503
- You're in trouble now, son,
she's checking The Code.

41:20.540 --> 41:23.270
Which one did you blow?

41:23.310 --> 41:27.679
- Alright, I know.
"Family First."

41:27.710 --> 41:29.678
But I was there, honey,
for almost the entire--

41:29.720 --> 41:32.041
Just tell me.

41:32.090 --> 41:35.856
- I missed your monologue,
honey. I'm sorry.

41:35.890 --> 41:39.155
Is she OK?
- She is now. She's
with her brother.

41:39.190 --> 41:41.954
I'm really sorry. What can I do?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.195
- Nothing.

41:44.230 --> 41:47.859
Except maybe you could let me
host the wrap party here.

41:47.900 --> 41:52.200
- Ho, ho, ho! Well played, girl.
Well played.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.778
- How come every woman I know is
a better poker player than I am?

41:55.810 --> 41:58.005
- Night, guys.
- Goodnight, sweetie.

41:58.040 --> 42:00.873
You were great.
- Thank you.
- See ya.

42:00.910 --> 42:03.140
- So, did you, uh,

42:03.180 --> 42:05.842
solve the other mystery
you were working on?

42:05.890 --> 42:08.211
- I decided we should just
keep it professional.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.081
She's got her life,
and I've got mine.

42:14.130 --> 42:17.099
- You really do have
a lousy poker face.

42:31.110 --> 42:34.716
- No.

42:34.750 --> 42:37.947
Just... celebrating
the successful end of a case.

42:37.980 --> 42:41.188
I just
came by to return this.

42:41.220 --> 42:44.087
- Living room.

42:44.120 --> 42:47.226
On the couch.

42:47.260 --> 42:49.057
- Well, thanks.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.091
For looking.
- You're welcome.

42:51.130 --> 42:53.189
For looking.

42:53.230 --> 42:56.165
- You just had to ask
about my alibi, didn't you?

42:56.200 --> 42:58.339
- You know I love
watching you spin.

42:58.370 --> 43:01.066
Look, Ang...
- Derek...

43:01.110 --> 43:03.738
- Last night was...
- Great, but...
- Kinda great.

43:03.780 --> 43:07.739
- Crazy.
- Good crazy.
- For sure.

43:07.780 --> 43:10.840
- Lady's choice.

43:14.720 --> 43:17.257
- Absolutely. One and done.

43:17.290 --> 43:21.124
- Thanks.

43:21.160 --> 43:24.220
- Anytime.

43:31.340 --> 43:35.879
- * Wild child, wild child

43:38.110 --> 43:45.209
* She's a wild child,
wild child *

43:45.250 --> 43:48.754
* She's a wild child,
wild child *

43:48.790 --> 43:51.213
* Wild Child

43:51.260 --> 43:55.856
* She's a wild child,
wild child *
