00:24.316 --> 00:25.317
Please.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.485
Please help!

00:26.527 --> 00:27.820
Help, somebody help me!

00:29.947 --> 00:31.073
Help!

00:42.459 --> 00:43.377
Okay, okay.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.004
What?

00:46.046 --> 00:46.839
What was that?

00:46.880 --> 00:47.673
Oh my god.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.300
No, not again, not again, not again.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.096
Oh my god.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.349
No I can't, I can't.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.147
Oh my god.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.862
No, no, no, no.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.615
Please help, please!

01:16.869 --> 01:18.245
Okay, I don't, I don't know if anybody's

01:18.287 --> 01:19.955
ever gonna see this.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.666
It's, oh god.

01:23.709 --> 01:24.752
It's...

01:24.793 --> 01:27.296
It's the 2nd of February 2020,

01:28.714 --> 01:32.384
and I have no way to get out of my house.

01:32.426 --> 01:36.513
All of my doors and my
windows, they're all locked.

01:36.555 --> 01:37.806
From the outside.

01:43.062 --> 01:45.439
My phone, my phone isn't working.

01:45.481 --> 01:47.983
I have no reception, my internet is down.

01:49.610 --> 01:53.489
I don't know, I don't
know why, but somebody or

01:54.573 --> 01:57.242
some thing is trying to kill me.

01:58.702 --> 02:03.040
Please just tell my Mom
and Dad that I love them

02:03.082 --> 02:03.916
and that,

02:07.127 --> 02:11.673
I wish I had done something
more with my life.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.134
I tried, I really, really tried to.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.010
If only.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.390
No.

02:19.431 --> 02:20.808
No, no please.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.684
Oh please, oh please, no, please, no!

02:26.313 --> 02:27.231
Oh shit.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.445
Oh god.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.699
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit shit.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.993
Okay, calm down, calm down.

02:40.828 --> 02:44.915
Fucking get a grip,
get a grip, get a grip.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.375
Okay, okay, okay.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.880
Oh fuck fuck fuck fuck.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.591
Come on come on come on.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.343
Oh god, oh shit.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.302
Shit shit,

02:57.344 --> 03:00.639
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.473
Okay.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.560
Oh god.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.355
If anyone finds this, tell my Mom and Dad

03:08.397 --> 03:10.774
that I'm sorry I didn't
make more of my life.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.735
I wanted to, and I'm...

03:15.404 --> 03:16.822
I love you, and...

03:23.370 --> 03:27.958
Who's there?

03:34.089 --> 03:37.968
I don't know if anyone
is ever gonna see this,

03:38.010 --> 03:38.844
but

03:41.263 --> 03:42.056
if I don't-

03:46.185 --> 03:48.187
IF I don't make it,

03:48.228 --> 03:51.065
it's it's it's February 2nd, 2020.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.736
My phone won't work.

03:55.778 --> 03:57.696
I have no reception and I can't,

03:57.738 --> 04:02.409
I can't open any of the windows
or the doors to outside.

04:04.119 --> 04:04.912
I think someone's-

04:10.542 --> 04:13.379
I think someone, some
thing is trying to...

04:21.845 --> 04:25.265
Why doesn't she just
break a fucking window?

04:25.307 --> 04:30.312
I love you, Kip, but this script
literally makes zero sense.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.997
Hey, where the fuck are you?

04:49.832 --> 04:50.624
What?

04:50.666 --> 04:51.458
Oh, come on, man.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.919
You're supposed to meet
me a half hour ago.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.338
Morning to you, too, Mark.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.340
Who eats lunch at
three in the afternoon?

05:03.721 --> 05:04.555
Oh dude.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.016
You got news on the Sorkin show?

05:08.058 --> 05:12.354
Yeah, dude, the network
didn't approve you.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.772
Network?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.941
It's on YouTube.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.234
Fuck.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.904
All right, well whatever, look,

05:20.946 --> 05:22.656
I've been thinking about
this next season of "Belle,"

05:22.698 --> 05:24.116
and I wanna walk.

05:25.451 --> 05:26.201
- They don't-
- Are you takin'

05:26.243 --> 05:28.162
a fuckin' piss?

05:28.203 --> 05:28.996
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.623
Listen, I'm gonna make this quick, okay?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.543
We decided to let you go.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.544
What?

05:35.586 --> 05:37.004
Yeah.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.964
We're letting you go.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.132
You're kind of an asshole.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.341
You're not very good.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.302
For somebody who thinks
that they're that smart,

05:43.343 --> 05:45.512
you're pretty untalented.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.931
And I'm really glad for you that

05:47.973 --> 05:49.516
the DUI thing worked out in your favor,

05:49.558 --> 05:50.934
but you're too much work.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.311
It's not worth the effort.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.854
Wow, Mark.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.484
You were so far up my ass
when I booked the show,

05:58.525 --> 05:59.818
I thought you were
ready make a home there.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.821
What was that whole fuckin' loyalty talk?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.698
Oh god, you know, Mark,

06:04.740 --> 06:07.284
you are why people hate agents.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.787
Well, you're the reason
people love actors.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.832
You know what Mark? If you think you're

06:13.874 --> 06:15.459
getting commission on next season

06:15.501 --> 06:18.796
I will do anything to
keep that money from you.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.464
My god, you really are so stupid.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.174
You think that you're on hiatus?

06:22.216 --> 06:23.008
Come on, man.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.134
You guys are getting canceled.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.386
Good luck finding more work.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.387
Fucking clown.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.555
What?

06:29.807 --> 06:30.974
Now look, watch this.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.609
I think someone, some thing is trying to-

06:40.651 --> 06:42.319
- Wait for it.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.657
Wait for it.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.370
Why doesn't she just
break a fucking window?

06:51.412 --> 06:52.663
And there it is.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.165
Look, Alex, I'm just saying,

06:55.207 --> 06:57.292
it woulda helped if you took
it a little more seriously.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.168
Yeah, well I think Chrissy

06:58.210 --> 07:00.504
took it seriously enough for all of us.

07:00.546 --> 07:01.839
Was it too much?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.133
And Kip, why are we
all doing the same scene?

07:04.174 --> 07:05.592
What up motherfuckers?

07:07.302 --> 07:09.888
Holy stache, Kip, what are you doin', man?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.181
Yeah, you dig?

07:11.223 --> 07:12.266
You dig?

07:12.307 --> 07:13.267
- No, no one digs.
- You look like

07:13.308 --> 07:16.186
Chris Hansen's wet spring break fantasy.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.354
- Okay, is Kelly coming?
- I don't know what that means

07:17.396 --> 07:18.188
but fuck you.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.190
You know, she probably
just wants us to wait.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.024
Why?

07:21.066 --> 07:21.984
'Cause she's Kelly.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.279
No, I just mean it's
like classic Sagittarius.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.572
- Hey Kel.
- What?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.742
Did you guys laugh
at my Instastory or no?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.826
- Every time.
- I chuckled.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.619
I wouldn't say I laughed.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.748
Wait, was it supposed to be funny?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.499
Fuck, I'm deleting it.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.168
Where's Declan?

07:39.209 --> 07:40.919
I don't know, jail in Thailand?

07:40.961 --> 07:41.754
That's not funny.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.588
Rehab?

07:42.629 --> 07:43.881
What is on your lip?

07:44.757 --> 07:48.343
Thank you for joining, Kel,
and I am growing my mustache.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.344
On purpose?

07:49.386 --> 07:50.637
What do you mean, yeah, on purpose.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.889
- Thank you.
- Hey, let him live.

07:51.930 --> 07:52.723
Let him live?

07:52.765 --> 07:54.183
I'm giving him all the space he needs.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.101
Okay, I'm here, what do you want?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.394
Okay, Kip and I were talking,

07:57.436 --> 08:00.147
and we both think that with
the show going back next month,

08:00.189 --> 08:01.982
if we all band together, like they did-

08:02.024 --> 08:04.068
- Yeah, like they did on "The Simpsons."

08:04.109 --> 08:04.902
Good show.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.779
Nope, like they did on "Friends,"

08:06.820 --> 08:08.155
if we all band together

08:08.197 --> 08:10.157
we could have a better
chance at getting more money.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.159
Yeah, but we're all
in different amounts.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.328
No, we would agree on
a percentage increase.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.788
So say it's like 10%.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.289
10% is like nothing.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.792
I took "Peanuts" season one
because it was my first pilot.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.169
Yeah, I mean, some
of us are on literally

08:22.211 --> 08:23.712
a fifth of everybody else.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.005
Yeah, but some of us have been

08:25.047 --> 08:26.090
in more seasons than others.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.883
Hey, what'd I miss?

08:29.134 --> 08:30.427
Manners, apparently.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.346
Okay, when people say 11, they mean 11.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.222
Jesus Christ, Kip, Amber Alert.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.683
Okay, guys, we're
talking about next season,

08:37.726 --> 08:39.436
and we need to all band together

08:39.477 --> 08:40.354
if we wanna get more money.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.605
Are you guys stupid?

08:41.647 --> 08:42.981
The show's getting canceled.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.233
- Oh my god.
- What?

08:44.274 --> 08:45.901
- What?
- Fuck you?

08:45.943 --> 08:47.569
My agent called me yesterday.

08:47.611 --> 08:48.404
Wait, no, how does he know?

08:48.445 --> 08:49.738
Molly told me we were going back.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.572
Yeah, me, too.

08:50.614 --> 08:51.407
How can they

08:51.448 --> 08:52.491
- just change their minds?
- No, no, no,

08:52.533 --> 08:53.867
there's no way they're canceling the show

08:53.909 --> 08:54.660
without telling me.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.744
I am the lead.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.538
I'm Belle, and I would know.

08:57.579 --> 08:58.497
So I'm calling my agent.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.999
My agent's brother-in-law
is the VP of the network,

09:01.041 --> 09:02.543
so if anyone's gonna know it's him.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.461
Oh, that's how you
stay on the show so long.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.380
What are you pissy about?

09:06.422 --> 09:08.132
You complained every
single day on that set.

09:08.173 --> 09:08.966
You know what?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.008
Just 'cause I didn't want to prance around

09:10.050 --> 09:12.177
pretending to be a 14th century warrior

09:12.219 --> 09:13.512
trapped in the body of a 17 year old

09:13.554 --> 09:16.056
doesn't mean I don't like getting paid.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.058
Oh my God, I just bought a new house.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.268
You guys, I knew this was gonna happen

09:19.309 --> 09:20.769
the second that Bobby
took over the network.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.563
He doesn't see our show
for what it could be.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.273
Yeah, I think it's I-E, not Y.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.984
Oh, hey, congratulations on
your new gig in spell check,

09:27.025 --> 09:28.193
the TV series.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.445
That's not even a real fuckin' show.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.780
Name's Bob-I-E Brower.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.450
That's a stupid name.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.703
Look, let's all think on
the bright side, guys.

09:37.745 --> 09:38.537
Okay?

09:38.579 --> 09:40.080
We can all start auditioning again.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.250
Meaning I can show what I
can really do as an actor.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.585
God.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.587
That's exactly what somebody

09:46.628 --> 09:48.839
who booked their first audition would say,

09:48.881 --> 09:50.132
but that's okay, you should.

09:50.174 --> 09:51.967
Okay, it wasn't my first.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.302
It was my second.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.928
Max, we can't audition.

09:54.970 --> 09:55.888
We're not allowed to.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.514
The studio owns us for another 12 months.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.308
They're not gonna release
us from our contracts.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.310
Okay, but if the show is canceled,

10:01.351 --> 10:02.269
then technically-

10:02.311 --> 10:03.437
- They'll keep us under contract

10:03.479 --> 10:04.897
for as long as they can just in case.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.565
Yeah, but in case of what?

10:06.607 --> 10:08.108
I mean, how are we supposed to make money?

10:08.150 --> 10:10.110
They'll give us a holding fee.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.195
How much?

10:11.236 --> 10:12.196
A few grand.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.697
- What?
- Oh my god,

10:13.739 --> 10:14.990
- I can't even.
- Look, I told you idiots

10:15.032 --> 10:15.908
to save your money.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.743
Oh, by the way, speaking of saving money,

10:17.785 --> 10:19.453
Max, how's your new Porsche?

10:19.495 --> 10:20.287
Ha ha.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.498
Okay, I didn't know it
was like burn Max day.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.208
But you know, I look dope in that car,

10:24.249 --> 10:25.751
- so shut up.
- That's amazing,

10:25.793 --> 10:27.086
'cause you're gonna be
living in it soon, so.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.797
Oh my God, what am I gonna do?

10:29.838 --> 10:30.798
You could always do

10:30.839 --> 10:32.925
another banana bread
tutorial on Instagram.

10:33.801 --> 10:34.968
Oh yeah, the sourdough one was good.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.095
You guys follow me?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.930
No, I don't follow you on Instagram.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.265
Guys, this is is bullshit.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.476
I can't go back to go-go dancing.

10:42.518 --> 10:45.020
Acting is the only real skill I even have.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.397
And you barely have that.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.481
What am I gonna do?

10:56.115 --> 10:57.866
We could keep making my movie.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.868
Okay.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.495
What movie?

11:01.537 --> 11:03.997
Oh, I am trying my hand at writing.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.125
I have this horror concept

11:06.166 --> 11:08.293
- that's pretty-
- Yeah, but we're still

11:08.335 --> 11:10.045
under contract, right?

11:10.087 --> 11:11.547
No, we make it ourselves.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.134
The scenes you guys
filmed were pretty good.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.094
The scenes they filmed?

11:17.136 --> 11:17.928
Uuuhhh.

11:17.970 --> 11:21.682
Yeah, yeah, a few of 'em
helped me film some scenes

11:21.724 --> 11:23.726
so I could just see what it sounded like.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.560
A few of 'em.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.437
And was that everyone?

11:26.478 --> 11:27.312
Or just...

11:28.856 --> 11:31.692
No, just Alex, Chrissy, and Max.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.236
Just everyone.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.071
He asked me too, but I said no.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.114
Of course you did.

11:37.156 --> 11:38.198
You know what, fuck you, Kip.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.491
That is really mean.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.703
Come on, Kelly, it's not
like you would have done it.

11:42.745 --> 11:43.829
I might have.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.122
No, you wouldn't have.

11:45.164 --> 11:46.874
Okay guys, can we all
just take a breath, please?

11:46.915 --> 11:47.708
Together?

11:47.750 --> 11:48.917
Good idea, everyone,

11:48.959 --> 11:50.753
one, two, three.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.798
Now let it go with a...

11:56.925 --> 11:58.010
I can't concentrate.

11:58.052 --> 11:58.886
Is he okay?

11:58.927 --> 12:00.137
You sound like you're cumming.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.597
Are you finished?

12:01.638 --> 12:02.598
It works.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.308
Okay, seriously guys, though.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.934
Kip, if the writing

12:07.311 --> 12:08.771
gets a little better,

12:08.812 --> 12:10.898
just being honest, just being honest,

12:10.939 --> 12:12.733
do you think that there
is something there?

12:12.775 --> 12:15.360
I, to be honest, back at ya,

12:15.402 --> 12:17.821
I really think we have something here.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.406
The scenes you guys filmed were good.

12:19.448 --> 12:22.785
And if we all did it and took it seriously

12:22.826 --> 12:24.912
we could definitely sell it.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.622
Especially if the show is canceled.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.874
I mean, honestly,
our fans would love it.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.125
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.336
You know you need more than actors

12:32.378 --> 12:33.629
and a script to make a movie.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.172
You need financing.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.423
You need a director.

12:36.465 --> 12:37.466
Kelly, please.

12:37.508 --> 12:38.842
Don't for one second pretend like you have

12:38.884 --> 12:40.761
ever needed a director
in your entire career.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.930
Okay, maybe I haven't needed
one, but you have needed one.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.474
- Okay, wow.
- Okay, okay, guys, guys.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.308
- If we keep doing-
- That's hostile.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.309
- What we've been-
- Let's be nice.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.977
We keep doing what we've been doing

12:49.019 --> 12:51.313
and we just shoot it ourselves.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.481
On what?

12:52.523 --> 12:53.482
On our phones.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.777
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

12:56.819 --> 12:57.986
Okay, no, Kelly, listen, Kelly.

12:58.028 --> 12:58.821
- Kelly, come on.
- Kelly, just listen,

12:58.862 --> 12:59.780
listen, listen, listen.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.323
The new phones they shoot in 4k.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.951
It's basically like, movie worthy.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.744
Look, I'm not being
funny, but I was the lead

13:05.786 --> 13:08.038
of one of the highest
grossing horror films in 2017.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.998
And I'm just not making a home movie.

13:10.040 --> 13:10.833
- So.
- Okay, well,

13:10.874 --> 13:11.792
this is found footage,

13:11.834 --> 13:13.585
so it doesn't matter if
the quality isn't the best.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.671
Oh wait, I'm sorry, but
everybody always looks

13:15.713 --> 13:17.214
super ugly in those movies.

13:17.256 --> 13:20.676
Well just use your
ring light then, sweetie.

13:20.718 --> 13:23.429
You know guys, I was
listening to Kevin Smith

13:23.470 --> 13:24.972
on Joe Rogan's podcast last night,

13:25.013 --> 13:26.348
- and he's-
- Oh god.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.934
Was a mullet required to
listen to that episode or?

13:33.063 --> 13:35.357
Anyways, they were
explaining that there's

13:35.399 --> 13:37.484
a lot of freedom in
filming your own stuff.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.403
That's what everybody
who can't get a studio

13:39.445 --> 13:40.904
to finance their movie says.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.489
I'll go fuck myself then, Declan.

13:42.531 --> 13:43.907
Okay, come on guys, come on.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.159
This could really be something.

13:45.200 --> 13:45.993
Okay?

13:46.034 --> 13:47.703
We could be our own producers.

13:47.745 --> 13:48.787
Call our own shots.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.039
Nobody holding us down.

13:51.081 --> 13:51.874
Okay.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.584
I mean, there is
something to that, yeah?

13:53.625 --> 13:54.877
Like taking a break from

13:54.918 --> 13:57.046
the archaic patriarchal
system of Hollywood.

13:57.087 --> 14:00.382
Look, I want to agree,
but what did you say?

14:00.424 --> 14:02.051
Babe, I'm in.

14:02.926 --> 14:03.719
Okay.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.471
I don't understand
any of it, but I'm in.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.805
That's what I'm talkin' about.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.223
Declan?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.516
Come on, dude.

14:09.558 --> 14:10.350
Just do it.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.268
- Sure, sure.
- Decky?

14:11.310 --> 14:14.521
There's only so many times
you can jerk off in one day.

14:14.563 --> 14:15.439
Gross.

14:15.481 --> 14:17.024
Not proven scientifically.

14:17.066 --> 14:19.651
Okay, one more, one more.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.861
- Kelly.
- Kelly.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.740
Kelly, Kelly Kelly.

14:25.824 --> 14:26.909
What's it about?

14:26.950 --> 14:27.743
What's it about?

14:27.785 --> 14:30.120
Oh my god, okay, it's about,

14:31.997 --> 14:36.001
it's about a spirit that
attacks people who sin.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.671
That's literally everyone.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.715
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

14:41.757 --> 14:42.591
Okay, okay, all right.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.425
Why don't we do this?

14:43.467 --> 14:45.427
Why don't we all get the scene

14:45.469 --> 14:47.262
and shoot it and then
we'll see what happens.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.097
We'll see what's there.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.139
Okay, perfect, perfect plan.

14:49.181 --> 14:52.184
I'll just, I'll re-tweak it
and then we can go from there.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.520
Great, and then send
it to us tonight, yeah?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.064
No, I have to write it still.

14:57.106 --> 14:58.273
Yeah, yeah, well write it now,

14:58.315 --> 14:59.817
and then send it to us tonight.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.068
No, it's not that easy.

15:01.110 --> 15:02.319
Dude, it's like 2 p.m.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.405
Ooo, I'll make a Dropbox.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.489
You download the app

15:05.531 --> 15:07.449
and then you click the
add all new videos tab,

15:07.491 --> 15:10.828
and then everything you film
will automatically upload.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.579
That sounds dangerous.

15:12.621 --> 15:13.831
Why?

15:13.872 --> 15:14.665
I have some notes.

15:14.706 --> 15:15.499
Can I be the lead?

15:15.541 --> 15:17.251
Let's just meet again on Thursday.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.377
Yeah, same time?

15:18.419 --> 15:21.046
Ah, I dunno if I can, you
know I got Lesly Kahn 'til noon.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.132
I have Botox at 11, so 11-

15:23.173 --> 15:23.966
- Lesly Kahn.
- What are you

15:24.007 --> 15:24.800
fucking laughing at?

15:24.842 --> 15:25.759
You do Botox?

15:25.801 --> 15:27.261
Botox, Kelly?

15:27.302 --> 15:28.095
What?

15:28.137 --> 15:28.929
Wow.

15:28.971 --> 15:29.763
I had no idea.

15:29.805 --> 15:30.597
You look so natural.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.267
Okay, guys, 2:30, Thursday.

15:33.308 --> 15:34.184
Yeah?

15:34.226 --> 15:35.185
- All right.
- Okay.

15:35.227 --> 15:36.103
- Whatever.
- Bye.

15:36.145 --> 15:37.229
- Peace and love babes.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait,

15:37.271 --> 15:38.689
wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:38.731 --> 15:39.523
What?

15:41.900 --> 15:42.985
- I was not ready.
- What was that?

15:43.026 --> 15:43.819
You're gonna post that aren't you?

15:43.861 --> 15:44.778
- Dude I-
- What the fuck?

15:44.820 --> 15:45.612
You're gonna fucking post it.

15:45.654 --> 15:46.488
I fucking know you are.

15:46.530 --> 15:47.865
I need content for my Only Fans.

15:47.906 --> 15:48.991
It pays my rent, fuck.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.492
- Yo yo yo, tag me.
- Oh my God,

15:50.534 --> 15:51.410
- please send it.
- No, don't tag me, okay?

15:54.705 --> 15:55.497
Guys.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.129
If anyone finds this
tell my mom and dad...

16:05.049 --> 16:07.634
No, no, no, please, no.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.228
It's good to be back.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.606
No, this can't be happening.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.317
Oh but it is.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.321
No, please.

16:29.073 --> 16:30.032
Please please stop.

16:30.074 --> 16:32.159
Why are you doing this?

16:32.201 --> 16:33.035
No.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.663
Oh wait, I gotta fix.

16:37.498 --> 16:38.332
Oh my God.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.588
Okay, I'm gonna take that again.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.132
Cleansing breath.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.722
No, no, no, please.

16:55.849 --> 16:59.269
Please, please, why are you doing this?

17:00.813 --> 17:02.523
Stop, stop.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.319
Making life more interesting.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.791
No please, please don't do this.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.752
Don't do this please.

17:23.794 --> 17:24.712
Please don't do this.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.422
Oh, she's so scared.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.007
Please don't do this.

17:29.049 --> 17:29.842
Who are you crying for?

17:29.883 --> 17:31.176
No no no no, I won't let you.

17:31.218 --> 17:31.969
I won't let...

17:32.010 --> 17:33.929
I won't let you?

17:33.971 --> 17:35.347
I won't,

17:35.389 --> 17:36.807
I won't let you.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.934
I won't let you.

17:38.976 --> 17:41.270
You're not in control anymore...

17:41.311 --> 17:44.231
This, I mean, this feels so cliche.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.569
Everyone else is doing this?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.657
Okay, I just, I wanted my family to know

17:53.699 --> 17:56.243
that I loved them and I wish
I stayed in dental school.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.119
I wish...

17:58.454 --> 17:59.955
I won't let you.

18:10.424 --> 18:14.178
Well, you are not in control anymore.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.220
Yes, I am.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.974
This feels really stupid.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.851
Like do I do voices?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.775
No please, I can't, not again.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.487
No, I, I won't let you.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.488
I won't let you do this.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.907
But this is my favorite game.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.366
Princess.

18:38.869 --> 18:39.661
You're not gonna get me.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.914
I won't let you do this.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.333
This is, this is like a lot,

18:44.374 --> 18:45.918
there's a lot happening here.

18:48.212 --> 18:49.046
No.

18:50.506 --> 18:53.175
Oh, don't don't, don't, stop, please.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.099
I wanna tell my mom
and dad that I'm sorry

19:00.140 --> 19:01.642
that I didn't go to dental school.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.065
I'm just gonna ad lib something,

19:08.107 --> 19:10.734
because I feel like that's, this is not-

19:10.776 --> 19:12.152
- Dental school?

19:12.194 --> 19:14.363
The only reason that I would
be going to dental school

19:14.405 --> 19:16.698
is for the fucking gas.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.826
I don't think they give
you that in dental school.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.328
This demon has zero intention.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.580
What, what is the point?

19:23.622 --> 19:25.416
What is the actual point of this demon?

19:25.457 --> 19:27.793
Like, that's just, like fuck, dude.

19:27.835 --> 19:28.794
I don't know,

19:28.836 --> 19:30.337
I don't know what to play.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.551
It's not that, I'm just
saying that possession

19:35.592 --> 19:36.468
is such a cliche.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.429
And why are we all reading
the same character?

19:38.470 --> 19:39.471
Dude, I asked that day one.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.806
Okay, it's a work in progress, you guys.

19:40.848 --> 19:43.016
And I'm just tryin' to
figure out everyone's flow.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.518
Well, I thought Kelly did great.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.352
Yeah, me, too.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.562
I mean, it was super subtle,

19:46.603 --> 19:48.814
- but like raw and organic.
- She did.

19:48.856 --> 19:49.732
Thank you.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.525
But there's no way you're
releasing any of that

19:51.567 --> 19:53.527
because the lighting
looks cheap and desperate,

19:53.569 --> 19:56.905
and what's with the whole,
this is a true story thing?

19:56.947 --> 19:58.449
I mean, the audience is gonna know

19:58.490 --> 20:01.243
if we're actually dead, we're famous.

20:01.285 --> 20:02.161
Most of us.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.370
Can hear you, clearly.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.873
Wait, do you guys actually
think the lighting looks cheap?

20:05.914 --> 20:08.167
Because I really don't
want people to think

20:08.208 --> 20:09.126
that I'm desperate.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.794
You should probably
rethink a lotta things then.

20:12.046 --> 20:12.838
- No, listen, Chrissy.
- Wait, what?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.173
Don't worry, it's raw, okay?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.507
If we do it black and white

20:15.549 --> 20:16.800
everyone would think it's like art house.

20:16.842 --> 20:17.634
Exactly.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.845
Guys, it shows that we are serious actors

20:19.887 --> 20:22.014
that only care about
the quality of the work.

20:22.056 --> 20:23.140
Yeah, I mean, Allison Janney

20:23.182 --> 20:24.808
didn't win her Oscar for "The Help"

20:24.850 --> 20:26.602
when she was dripping in pearls.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.520
She won it for "I, Tonya"

20:28.562 --> 20:30.856
when she was literally
strapped to an oxygen tank.

20:30.898 --> 20:31.732
Exactly.

20:31.774 --> 20:33.984
Oh my God, that was Allison Janney?

20:34.026 --> 20:35.069
Wow.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.320
What?

20:36.361 --> 20:39.907
Vanity aside, the plot's whack.

20:39.948 --> 20:43.243
Like there's a spirit attacking
people with bad shit in them

20:43.285 --> 20:44.078
- and then what?
- Exactly.

20:44.119 --> 20:44.912
That's what's scary.

20:44.953 --> 20:45.954
It's relatable.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.414
It's relatable for about 20 minutes

20:47.456 --> 20:48.916
and then you lose your audience.

20:48.957 --> 20:52.503
I mean, people wanna be
challenged, not spoonfed.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.381
You know, Lesly Kahn always says-

20:55.422 --> 20:56.382
Again.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.050
What is the-

20:58.092 --> 20:59.093
- Oh Christ.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.012
what, what, what's so funny.

21:02.054 --> 21:03.013
Nothing dude.

21:03.055 --> 21:03.847
Well, how do you know

21:03.889 --> 21:04.681
if someone's studies with Lesly Kahn?

21:04.723 --> 21:06.100
- Don't, don't.
- They'll tell you.

21:07.518 --> 21:10.312
Well, you're an idiot.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.230
Good one.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.439
Okay guys, okay, okay, look,

21:12.481 --> 21:13.857
Kelly does have a point, right?

21:13.899 --> 21:16.402
We should give the characters
something to fight for.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.904
So, I don't know how are
they gonna beat the spirit?

21:18.946 --> 21:21.615
How do you beat something unbeatable?

21:21.657 --> 21:22.950
Deep, Chrissy.

21:22.991 --> 21:23.867
What is she doing?

21:23.909 --> 21:26.286
Chrissy, why are you
talking to a necklace?

21:26.328 --> 21:27.371
What?

21:27.413 --> 21:30.249
Oh, this is actually a pendulum.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.751
So it helps me make decisions.

21:32.793 --> 21:35.337
I just ask it a yes or
no question, and then-

21:35.379 --> 21:36.714
- You should be careful with that shit.

21:36.755 --> 21:39.425
You never know who or what
you're calling on to answer it.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.342
Those things are like

21:40.384 --> 21:41.260
pretty little Oujia Boards that you wear.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.094
What do you mean?

21:42.136 --> 21:43.220
It's a necklace.

21:43.262 --> 21:45.305
No, Kel, I got this at the Rose Bowl.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.016
Okay, nothing bad ever
happens in Pasadena.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.601
According to who?

21:49.643 --> 21:51.145
Fine, how does it move?

21:51.186 --> 21:51.979
Physics?

21:52.020 --> 21:54.106
No, it connects to your higher self

21:54.148 --> 21:55.774
- to give you divine guidance.
- Exactly.

21:55.816 --> 21:59.319
Divine, also known as spirituality, God.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.487
It's a conduit.

22:00.529 --> 22:01.572
It's a necklace.

22:01.613 --> 22:04.783
All I'm saying is, who's
pushing the pendulum?

22:04.825 --> 22:07.995
Can't answer a door without opening it.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.622
Wait, hold on, wait, wait,
wait, that's kinda good.

22:10.664 --> 22:11.457
That might work.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.000
Yeah, who's pushing the pendulum?

22:13.041 --> 22:14.168
Yeah, that's kinda great, Kel.

22:14.209 --> 22:17.087
I mean, I wrote most of
my own stuff on "Belle," so.

22:17.129 --> 22:20.382
So, what if our
characters use the pendulum

22:20.424 --> 22:21.717
to summon a spirit to help them

22:21.759 --> 22:23.886
banish the spirit that's attacking them?

22:23.927 --> 22:25.345
Yeah, I love that.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.599
I'm pretty sure that's not
how it actually works, guys.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.476
I do have some experience in this field.

22:30.517 --> 22:34.855
Oh, it'll be like "The
Craft" meets "Poltergeist."

22:34.897 --> 22:36.315
I'm into it.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.399
Just be careful, Kip.

22:37.441 --> 22:41.111
'Cause supernatural stuff
gets so cheesy really quick.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.655
Well actually, I might
have something, you know?

22:43.697 --> 22:46.283
I saw it on Reddit the other day.

22:46.325 --> 22:48.994
- Banishment curses.
- Banishment curses?

22:49.036 --> 22:51.205
Why you lookin' up
banishment curses, Declan?

22:51.246 --> 22:52.664
I was gonna send one to my agent.

22:52.706 --> 22:53.499
Wow.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.333
Yikes.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.584
You're so creepy.

22:55.626 --> 22:57.294
I take back calling you an idiot,

22:57.336 --> 22:58.128
'cause now I'm terrified.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.089
- Just fire him.
- Here, here, here, here.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.216
Someone read this.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.258
I got it.

23:04.301 --> 23:08.722
I call upon the darkness, for
only you can halt the attack.

23:08.764 --> 23:11.392
I call upon your forces to take them away,

23:11.433 --> 23:13.268
to take them back.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.896
On the road to evil from my home to yours,

23:15.938 --> 23:20.651
I consent to your power for
all the days and all the hours.

23:23.529 --> 23:24.488
What the fuck?

23:24.530 --> 23:25.781
Okay, what the fuck?

23:25.823 --> 23:27.324
That's a little on the
nose, don't you think?

23:27.366 --> 23:28.450
Declan, did you do that?

23:28.492 --> 23:29.743
That was amazing.

23:29.785 --> 23:30.661
That was amazing.

23:30.702 --> 23:33.705
I can play around with it a
little so it's not so obvious,

23:33.747 --> 23:35.332
but that's good.

23:35.374 --> 23:37.376
Great, so then we'll
just shoot the next scenes,

23:37.418 --> 23:39.128
and then we'll see if we
can stitch some together.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.629
- Cool, okay.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

23:40.671 --> 23:41.672
I mean, yeah, it's not that easy.

23:41.714 --> 23:42.715
You can't just put it together-

23:42.756 --> 23:44.133
- Do we have a name yet?

23:44.174 --> 23:47.970
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I was
thinking "The Reckoning."

23:48.011 --> 23:48.929
No.

23:48.971 --> 23:49.763
No.

23:49.805 --> 23:50.681
- Why?
- I don't like it.

23:50.723 --> 23:51.515
All around?

23:51.557 --> 23:52.433
No, nobody?

23:52.474 --> 23:53.892
Pendulum, "The Pendulum."

23:53.934 --> 23:56.645
No, that's for sure not it.

23:56.687 --> 23:58.105
"Untitled Horror Movie."

23:58.147 --> 23:59.523
- What?
- Meta.

23:59.565 --> 24:00.357
This is weird.

24:00.399 --> 24:01.775
No, when you Google it it's gonna be

24:01.817 --> 24:03.402
the first thing that
comes up, that's genius.

24:03.444 --> 24:05.529
Oh come on, you guys
come on, that's lame.

24:05.571 --> 24:07.072
I mean, will people get it?

24:07.114 --> 24:08.198
- It's funny.
- No, no, no,

24:08.240 --> 24:09.783
but then, but then, who's
pushing the pendulum

24:09.825 --> 24:11.076
could be the tagline.

24:11.118 --> 24:12.745
That's kinda long for a hashtag.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.413
Okay, all right, all right.

24:14.455 --> 24:16.165
Well, Kelly, why don't you check with CAA?

24:16.206 --> 24:17.249
See which one they like best.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.417
I'm telling my agents about this.

24:18.459 --> 24:20.002
They'll shut it down quicker

24:20.044 --> 24:22.588
than the time it takes you to ejaculate.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.964
- That is-
- Wow.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.759
You know what, that's my cue.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.719
- I'm for sure, bye guys.
- I don't.

24:28.761 --> 24:30.679
Okay, peace and love.

24:30.721 --> 24:31.847
- It's not that easy to write.
- Bye.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.557
We believe in you.

24:34.683 --> 24:37.728
I thought "The
Reckoning" was way better.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.774
Hey, Kel, what's up?

24:45.027 --> 24:46.236
Kel?

24:46.278 --> 24:48.697
What do you think my
strengths are as an actor?

24:48.739 --> 24:50.032
Oh Jesus, I.

24:50.074 --> 24:52.367
I'm serious, I wanna know.

24:55.037 --> 24:58.332
Okay, you're good at
making scenes feel real.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.210
You always hit the emotional connection.

25:01.251 --> 25:03.837
I mean, you can cry like nobody else,

25:03.879 --> 25:06.757
- so that's good.
- Good, so you do know.

25:06.799 --> 25:08.467
Now can you actually
write me some scenes

25:08.509 --> 25:10.219
that show my range?

25:12.096 --> 25:13.263
Kelly, that's not really how it works.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.808
You can't just tell a
writer what to write.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.267
Of course you can.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.852
Vin Diesel does it all the time.

25:18.894 --> 25:20.854
I mean, why do you think The
Rock was in a hospital bed

25:20.896 --> 25:25.901
for the entire "Fast Eight"
or "Furious 11" or whatever?

25:26.318 --> 25:27.152
What?

25:30.531 --> 25:31.990
Look, you play a dick on the show.

25:32.032 --> 25:34.201
Don't be one in real life.

25:35.744 --> 25:38.330
Okay.

25:38.372 --> 25:39.665
How did I ever date her?

25:43.210 --> 25:44.294
Okay, I don't have a pendulum.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.256
So like somebody gifted me this.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.132
I'm gonna use it.

26:01.437 --> 26:03.439
I have no choice.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.982
If I wanna live,

26:06.024 --> 26:07.943
I must involve the darkness.

26:07.985 --> 26:09.528
I must complete the ritual.

26:14.908 --> 26:18.412
With this candle I call upon and stir...

26:19.455 --> 26:20.956
Fuck.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.708
With this candle.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.877
I call upon and stir.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.545
I call him call upon and...

26:26.587 --> 26:27.421
Fuck me.

26:28.714 --> 26:30.883
The lords of fire.

26:36.805 --> 26:37.639
Fire

26:39.641 --> 26:41.143
and the south.

26:41.185 --> 26:44.354
With this sage I call upon and stir.

26:46.982 --> 26:50.652
The lords of the air and the east.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.327
With this bowl, I call upon and stir

27:01.872 --> 27:04.541
the lords of water and the west.

27:08.587 --> 27:10.297
I'm sorry, I have to stop you.

27:10.339 --> 27:13.008
Sorry, hold on, hold on.

27:13.050 --> 27:14.593
How was that?

27:14.635 --> 27:15.969
It was very good.

27:16.011 --> 27:18.138
But there are a couple things
that we need to talk about.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.516
I don't really understand
your relationship

27:20.557 --> 27:23.268
to the water and the west.

27:23.310 --> 27:25.312
You're just saying them
like they're words.

27:25.354 --> 27:26.480
I'm not getting an image on water.

27:26.522 --> 27:27.481
Okay.

27:27.523 --> 27:28.315
Do you follow?

27:28.357 --> 27:29.483
I'm not getting an image on west.

27:29.525 --> 27:31.151
- That was dumb, yeah.
- And also, aren't you

27:31.193 --> 27:34.363
talking about stirring
something in a bowl?

27:34.405 --> 27:35.280
Where's the bowl?

27:35.322 --> 27:36.115
I don't see a bowl.

27:36.156 --> 27:37.616
Why are you miming?

27:37.658 --> 27:38.867
- Don't mime.
- Stupid.

27:38.909 --> 27:40.828
Why would you mime?

27:40.869 --> 27:42.496
Okay, so repeat after me.

27:42.538 --> 27:43.497
Don't mime.

27:43.539 --> 27:44.456
Don't mime.

27:44.498 --> 27:45.541
Don't mime.

27:45.582 --> 27:46.834
Don't mime.

27:46.875 --> 27:47.918
Don't mime.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.044
Don't mime.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.671
You're not going to mime.

27:50.713 --> 27:51.505
Okay.

27:51.547 --> 27:52.297
- I remember now.
- Don't mime.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.132
I got it, I got it, I got it.

27:53.173 --> 27:53.966
Let's do it again

27:54.007 --> 27:55.718
and remember why you're doing this?

27:55.759 --> 27:56.593
You're doing this

27:56.635 --> 27:57.886
to entertain the people.

27:57.928 --> 27:59.263
Got it, got it, got it.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.233
With this bowl.

28:11.275 --> 28:14.945
With this bowl.

28:14.987 --> 28:18.490
I call upon and stir the lords of water.

28:19.491 --> 28:21.326
The lords of water.

28:21.368 --> 28:22.703
And the west.

28:29.585 --> 28:31.795
Oh my god, Max.

28:31.837 --> 28:32.671
Yeah?

28:33.797 --> 28:36.633
Oh my god, Max, that was,

28:36.675 --> 28:38.218
that was incredible.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.387
Oh, yes, thank you, Lesly.

28:40.429 --> 28:42.139
Did you see how you were
listening to the water?

28:42.181 --> 28:43.766
Yeah, I was in it, palpable.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.059
You are on it.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.310
- Yes.
- I am really happy

28:46.351 --> 28:47.644
- with what you're doing.
- Yes.

28:47.686 --> 28:48.812
Thank you, Lesly.

28:48.854 --> 28:49.646
That's really good.

28:49.688 --> 28:50.981
This is why I work with ya.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.650
With this soil.

28:53.692 --> 28:58.697
I call upon and stir the lords
of the earth and the north.

28:59.948 --> 29:02.659
I call upon the darkness,

29:02.701 --> 29:05.120
for only you can halt the attack.

29:05.162 --> 29:09.083
I call upon your
forces to take them away,

29:09.124 --> 29:10.167
to take them back.

29:10.209 --> 29:11.919
On the road to evil.

29:13.879 --> 29:17.716
From my home to yours
I consent to your power.

29:17.758 --> 29:19.385
For all the days

29:19.426 --> 29:20.928
and all the hours.

29:23.013 --> 29:23.931
Yes, Max.

29:24.973 --> 29:25.724
Yeah?

29:25.766 --> 29:26.558
Yes, Max.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.726
Oh, thank god.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.603
That's exactly what I was talking about.

29:29.645 --> 29:32.064
Did you see what happened to Khaleesi?

29:32.106 --> 29:35.109
She was panting like a motherfucker.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.411
On the road to evil,
from my home to yours.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.788
I consent to your power.

29:47.830 --> 29:49.331
For all the days and all the hours.

29:49.373 --> 29:52.918
For all the days and all the hours.

30:03.345 --> 30:05.055
That was better, Kip.

30:05.097 --> 30:06.056
Thank you.

30:06.098 --> 30:07.725
I added that part-

30:07.766 --> 30:10.894
- You could dig deeper, though.

30:10.936 --> 30:13.439
Okay, everyone, that
was a really great job.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.649
Chrissy, nice fall, by the way.

30:15.691 --> 30:16.942
I mean, I coulda done more,

30:16.984 --> 30:20.529
but I didn't know if you
wanted full Charlize.

30:20.571 --> 30:22.823
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

30:22.865 --> 30:23.657
I have awesome news.

30:23.699 --> 30:25.117
Imagine what we could do if we had

30:25.159 --> 30:27.077
a script by an actual writer.

30:27.119 --> 30:29.413
- Isn't-
- I can hear you Dicklan.

30:29.455 --> 30:30.289
Yeah, I know.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.290
Wow.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.875
What's on your neck?

30:32.916 --> 30:33.709
Oh my god.

30:33.751 --> 30:35.252
It's a tat.

30:35.294 --> 30:37.546
My character has tats, so.

30:37.588 --> 30:38.881
That's commitment.

30:38.922 --> 30:39.840
His character's edgy.

30:39.882 --> 30:40.716
Can you guys hear me?

30:40.758 --> 30:43.010
- Is this a wifi thing or like?
- Yeah, what?

30:43.052 --> 30:44.803
Okay, yeah, you guys
are just being assholes,

30:44.845 --> 30:45.763
like I thought.

30:45.804 --> 30:47.306
I have awesome news.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.475
I cut up some of the
footage, just in iMovie,

30:49.516 --> 30:50.559
sent it over to my manager.

30:50.601 --> 30:51.393
You what?

30:51.435 --> 30:52.227
Max!

30:52.269 --> 30:53.062
Oh my God.

30:53.103 --> 30:56.106
You can't just send out
unedited, unfinished footage.

30:56.148 --> 30:57.691
Okay, okay, relax, guys.

30:57.733 --> 31:01.653
It was just to my manager
and her friend at Lionsgate.

31:01.695 --> 31:02.613
- What?
- What?

31:02.654 --> 31:04.323
Max, what the fuck, dude?

31:04.364 --> 31:05.199
You're so stupid.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.033
What, guys?

31:06.075 --> 31:06.950
It's a good thing.

31:06.992 --> 31:08.911
They went nuts for it.

31:08.952 --> 31:09.745
- Wait, Lionsgate?
- What?

31:09.787 --> 31:10.579
Yeah.

31:10.621 --> 31:11.455
Like actual Lionsgate.

31:11.497 --> 31:12.498
Lionsgate.

31:13.373 --> 31:14.917
Yeah, Lionsgate, Lionsgate.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.211
And she said that if we put together

31:17.252 --> 31:18.629
about 15 minutes of the footage

31:18.670 --> 31:20.923
she will walk it right
into the studio herself.

31:20.964 --> 31:21.757
Puh!

31:22.633 --> 31:23.425
Oh my god.

31:23.467 --> 31:24.259
What's that gonna cost us?

31:24.301 --> 31:26.011
5% of the movie plus her producer credit?

31:26.053 --> 31:26.929
Dude, it doesn't matter.

31:26.970 --> 31:27.763
That's great news.

31:27.805 --> 31:28.889
Thank you, Kip.

31:28.931 --> 31:31.266
No, tell me you at
least colored it first.

31:31.308 --> 31:32.101
Yeah.

31:32.142 --> 31:32.935
Well, I thought we were going for

31:32.976 --> 31:34.686
the whole raw, "I, Tonya" thing.

31:34.728 --> 31:35.938
Oh god.

31:35.979 --> 31:36.855
Just 'cause it's raw doesn't mean it's-

31:36.897 --> 31:38.816
- Oh I have this app that makes videos,

31:38.857 --> 31:40.275
they look like super vibey.

31:40.317 --> 31:41.693
Oh my god, it's amazing.

31:41.735 --> 31:42.528
That's still-

31:42.569 --> 31:43.487
- Are we mad about this or happy?

31:43.529 --> 31:44.321
'Cause I don't really understand.

31:44.363 --> 31:45.864
Listen, Max, it is awesome.

31:45.906 --> 31:46.698
Happy.

31:46.740 --> 31:47.866
- Yes, but.
- Okay, thank you.

31:47.908 --> 31:48.867
I don't think we should sell it

31:48.909 --> 31:50.119
to the first studio that wants it, right?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.871
We should play the field,
start a bidding war.

31:52.913 --> 31:55.416
No, that's, that's
actually a great point.

31:55.457 --> 31:58.335
They're interested because
the stuff we shot was good.

31:58.377 --> 32:01.338
And if they're interested,
then others will be, too.

32:01.380 --> 32:02.172
- Exactly.
- So,

32:02.214 --> 32:03.465
I'll finish writing a scene,

32:03.507 --> 32:05.300
and then we could just
film some more stuff.

32:05.342 --> 32:06.844
Great, just take your time.

32:06.885 --> 32:07.678
Okay?

32:07.720 --> 32:08.637
Don't rush it.

32:08.679 --> 32:10.013
It needs to be good.

32:10.055 --> 32:12.808
And Chrissy, how did you
do that shadow thing?

32:12.850 --> 32:13.684
Oh yeah.

32:13.726 --> 32:16.228
It was extra, but it worked, so.

32:16.270 --> 32:17.604
What shadow thing?

32:17.646 --> 32:18.439
Come on.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.314
What?

32:19.356 --> 32:20.149
what?

32:20.190 --> 32:21.525
I'm sorry, guys.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.152
- I don't know.
- Here we go again.

32:23.193 --> 32:24.153
No, like I really don't know what

32:24.194 --> 32:25.112
- you're talking about.
- Okay.

32:25.154 --> 32:25.946
We get it Chrissy,

32:25.988 --> 32:26.780
- we get it.
- Keep your secrets.

32:26.822 --> 32:28.031
- That's fine.
- Okay, bye.

32:28.073 --> 32:30.576
- Peace out weirdos.
- Bye bye.

32:32.453 --> 32:35.873
Kip, does she think we're stupid?

32:35.914 --> 32:38.500
I mean, it's like, do you want
this thing to be good or not?

32:38.542 --> 32:41.336
Listen, I don't think she knows
what we were talking about.

32:41.378 --> 32:43.464
No, she used to do this
all the time in rehearsals.

32:43.505 --> 32:44.673
She would phone it in,

32:44.715 --> 32:46.467
and then she would pull out her choices

32:46.508 --> 32:47.801
when the cameras were actually rolling.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.428
Like I would ever steal from her.

32:49.470 --> 32:51.930
Listen, Kelly, maybe she
just had a record player

32:51.972 --> 32:54.850
and the light on it so when
it turned, it just made this,

32:54.892 --> 32:56.894
I don't know, light on the wall

32:56.935 --> 32:57.728
- or something.
- I actually,

32:57.770 --> 32:58.604
I think I have one of those, I can-

32:58.645 --> 33:01.482
- Wait, Kelly, just,
Kelly, let her have it.

33:01.523 --> 33:04.985
Okay, you know you're gonna shine.

33:05.027 --> 33:06.195
You always do.

33:08.906 --> 33:10.157
You should come over.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.242
We can practice the scenes.

33:12.284 --> 33:14.703
I would but I have to work.

33:16.330 --> 33:18.248
It's just that I'm so scared.

33:18.290 --> 33:21.001
The scenes are so good and
I'm having trouble sleeping.

33:21.043 --> 33:23.087
Okay, yeah, nice try.

33:23.128 --> 33:25.631
Call me if you need me, okay?

33:25.672 --> 33:26.757
I need you.

33:27.758 --> 33:29.760
If you really need me.

33:34.348 --> 33:35.682
And it's gone.

33:37.476 --> 33:39.144
What, is it the mustache?

33:39.186 --> 33:39.978
- Really?
- Goodnight, Kipper.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.731
Oh my God, you guys are ridiculous.

33:56.662 --> 33:58.247
I figured it out.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.167
It's you.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.965
I should've known.

34:09.257 --> 34:12.678
Penny, Penny, there is not one single day

34:13.721 --> 34:16.639
that goes by that I don't miss you.

34:18.684 --> 34:19.893
I wish we could just go back

34:19.935 --> 34:22.938
to sitting on the couch and watching TV

34:22.980 --> 34:26.150
like we had all the time in the world.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.402
Because we did.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.741
At least I thought we did.

34:33.782 --> 34:36.869
I know you're angry, and I'm sorry.

34:41.873 --> 34:44.126
I shoulda tried harder.

34:47.463 --> 34:50.049
I shoulda been a better friend.

34:53.469 --> 34:55.512
If I could take it all back, I would.

35:00.059 --> 35:01.560
Penny, I miss you.

35:03.437 --> 35:05.939
I hate you for what you did,

35:11.070 --> 35:15.032
but it doesn't deny the
fact that I love you,

35:15.074 --> 35:17.326
and I probably always will.

35:18.285 --> 35:22.039
But maybe our love
just wasn't meant to be.

35:25.167 --> 35:29.338
Maybe our love was always
just meant to be free.

35:31.048 --> 35:32.383
The way that you are now.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.011
I'm sorry.

35:38.806 --> 35:39.890
I'm so sorry.

35:41.892 --> 35:42.976
I coulda done better.

35:43.018 --> 35:45.479
I should have done better.

35:45.521 --> 35:48.565
And as much as I wanna
see you and keep you,

35:48.607 --> 35:49.608
Penny, I, um...

35:52.194 --> 35:53.946
I have to let you go.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.074
It has to,

35:58.700 --> 35:59.785
it has to end here.

36:09.712 --> 36:10.671
You don't have to be like this.

36:12.798 --> 36:14.633
You don't have to be like this.

36:19.638 --> 36:21.265
What the?

36:21.306 --> 36:23.267
I'm so sorry.

36:23.308 --> 36:24.268
It has to end here.

36:25.936 --> 36:28.605
it has to end here, Penny.

36:28.647 --> 36:30.399
It has to end here.

36:45.122 --> 36:46.832
Did anyone see the weird
lightning last night?

36:46.874 --> 36:50.085
Like it wasn't raining,
but it was lightning.

36:50.127 --> 36:50.919
- No.
- Hmm-mmm.

36:50.961 --> 36:53.714
No, but dude, something
really strange happened

36:53.756 --> 36:54.590
while I was filming.

36:54.631 --> 36:55.799
I rolled camera and I'm

36:55.841 --> 36:56.967
- going into the scene-
- Where's Chrissy?

36:57.009 --> 36:59.678
It's really unprofessional
to keep people waiting.

36:59.720 --> 37:00.596
Hi Kelly.

37:00.637 --> 37:01.972
Is it Kelly?

37:02.014 --> 37:04.433
Unprofessional to keep people waiting?

37:04.475 --> 37:06.602
No, I haven't heard from her.

37:06.643 --> 37:07.895
She's probably still at rehearsal.

37:07.936 --> 37:08.812
Rehearsal?

37:08.854 --> 37:10.064
Wait, rehearsal for what?

37:10.105 --> 37:11.356
She kept talking about some play

37:11.398 --> 37:12.399
she was thinkin' of doing.

37:12.441 --> 37:15.110
Honey, if I had an Oscar for
every time I used that line

37:15.152 --> 37:16.320
- I'd be Meryl Streep.
- I'm sorry,

37:16.361 --> 37:17.946
Chrissy's doing a play?

37:17.988 --> 37:20.199
Yeah, she didn't tell you guys about it?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.533
She's been busy like all week.

37:21.575 --> 37:22.743
- Every time I've spoken to her.
- Yeah, no.

37:22.785 --> 37:24.286
There's no way she's doing a play.

37:24.328 --> 37:25.788
You actually have to
have talent to do that.

37:25.829 --> 37:28.290
So that's a lie.

37:28.332 --> 37:29.124
Okay. Thank you, Kelly.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.668
I will try calling her really quickly.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.797
Okay, but not to be mean,
but does it really matter?

37:34.838 --> 37:38.258
I mean, she's not adding
that much value to the movie.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.093
- Declan.
- Dude.

37:39.134 --> 37:43.806
Declan, she's literally
one of the leads of our show.

37:43.847 --> 37:46.642
She's not the lead, though, so,

37:46.683 --> 37:47.976
people will still watch without her.

37:48.018 --> 37:49.019
Here we go.

37:49.061 --> 37:49.853
What?

37:49.895 --> 37:51.397
You guys would all get a pay raise, okay?

37:51.438 --> 37:52.439
So don't give me that.

37:52.481 --> 37:54.191
Oh, you are unbelievable.
You guys,

37:54.233 --> 37:56.068
you won't believe what
just happened to me.

37:56.110 --> 37:57.236
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- Oh my god, Chrissy, what?

37:57.277 --> 37:58.445
Babe, what happened to your eye?

37:58.487 --> 37:59.279
Are you okay?

37:59.321 --> 38:00.197
Are you doing a play?

38:00.239 --> 38:01.031
- Who's directing?
- What?

38:01.073 --> 38:01.949
- Oh my god.
- Kelly.

38:01.990 --> 38:04.910
No, I'm not doing,
listen to me, you guys.

38:04.952 --> 38:08.372
I was, I was trying to
shoot one of the scenes,

38:08.414 --> 38:10.833
and all of a sudden, I don't,

38:10.874 --> 38:12.584
I don't even know how to say it.

38:18.048 --> 38:20.426
Chrissy, we can't
understand you if you overact.

38:20.467 --> 38:21.468
You gotta bring it down.

38:21.510 --> 38:22.678
Just like a little bit.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.680
Just give yourself somewhere to go.

38:24.722 --> 38:27.725
Okay, okay, you guys, just listen.

38:28.976 --> 38:30.519
I was doing this scene,

38:30.561 --> 38:34.815
and all of a sudden I just
started slapping myself.

38:36.233 --> 38:38.736
Like I couldn't stop.

38:38.777 --> 38:41.363
I was so scared, you guys.

38:41.405 --> 38:42.948
And it was just my hand to do

38:42.990 --> 38:46.160
over and over and over and over.

38:46.201 --> 38:48.620
Chrissy, Chrissy, Chrissy, me, too.

38:48.662 --> 38:49.455
Me, too.

38:49.496 --> 38:52.624
I punched myself right in the chin.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.084
And it's like it took over me.

38:54.126 --> 38:57.254
I only did it once and
I think I passed out,

38:57.296 --> 38:59.631
but I decided when I got up

38:59.673 --> 39:02.676
that I needed to use this in the scene.

39:02.718 --> 39:05.012
Ah, you're a fuckin' pro, Max.

39:05.054 --> 39:06.013
What?

39:06.055 --> 39:07.264
That's one name for it.

39:07.306 --> 39:08.474
Thanks, Kip.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.561
Chrissy, are you, babe are you okay?

39:12.603 --> 39:15.147
Do you need me to come over?

39:15.189 --> 39:17.441
No, I'm gonna be fine.

39:17.483 --> 39:18.901
I think.

39:18.942 --> 39:23.113
I told you not to
mess with the dark arts.

39:23.155 --> 39:24.740
What?

39:24.782 --> 39:25.574
Oh my god.

39:25.616 --> 39:26.992
Is this Hogwarts?

39:27.034 --> 39:29.244
Okay, you guys, maybe,

39:29.286 --> 39:31.038
maybe, Chrissy, maybe your performance

39:31.080 --> 39:33.957
was just so good that
you got carried away.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.000
You know?

39:35.042 --> 39:35.959
Been there.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.002
Is that a thing?

39:37.044 --> 39:38.462
Oh totally.

39:38.504 --> 39:40.422
- Yes.
- Yeah, of course.

39:40.464 --> 39:42.883
You're just so in the scene
you get lost in the moment.

39:42.925 --> 39:45.636
You're just so in character
you lose track of everything.

39:45.677 --> 39:48.222
It's like performance amnesia.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.681
You guys actually think?

39:49.723 --> 39:52.142
Definitely, like a hundred percent.

39:52.184 --> 39:52.976
Totally.

39:53.018 --> 39:54.603
How is there any doubt about this, guys?

39:54.645 --> 39:56.939
I mean, do you not
remember season two finale?

39:56.980 --> 39:57.940
When I was under that curse,

39:57.981 --> 40:00.567
the big scene, Universal
backlot, right by "Jaws."

40:00.609 --> 40:02.277
You remember?

40:02.319 --> 40:03.404
What?

40:03.445 --> 40:04.321
Anyways.

40:04.363 --> 40:07.366
I really started to
believe that I was evil.

40:07.408 --> 40:09.535
I mean, my mom wouldn't
talk to me for like a week.

40:09.576 --> 40:11.412
That feels very unrelated.

40:11.453 --> 40:13.205
It's in the same lane, but okay.

40:13.247 --> 40:14.081
Kelly?

40:16.208 --> 40:17.042
Kel?

40:20.003 --> 40:21.839
Yeah, yeah.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.592
A few years ago I trained
with the USC diving team

40:25.634 --> 40:28.345
for this aquatic film I was doing,

40:28.387 --> 40:32.599
and well for like a month,
I thought I was a diver.

40:33.976 --> 40:34.810
Wow.

40:35.644 --> 40:39.106
All right, listen, why
don't we all take tonight off?

40:39.148 --> 40:41.942
It feels like that's much needed.

40:41.984 --> 40:43.444
Kip can work on another scene,

40:43.485 --> 40:46.113
and then we will chat again tomorrow.

40:46.155 --> 40:47.030
- Okay?
- Yeah,

40:47.072 --> 40:47.865
Yeah, sure.

40:47.906 --> 40:49.283
Okay, thank you guys so much.

40:49.324 --> 40:52.161
I'm sorry I like freaked out.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.290
Oh my god, it's also like a full moon,

40:56.331 --> 40:59.793
and so maybe I just got like, so in it.

40:59.835 --> 41:00.919
Isn't it daytime?

41:00.961 --> 41:02.963
Anyway, I'm gonna go cleanse my aura,

41:03.005 --> 41:05.215
- do a face mask, just TLC.
- Move your,

41:05.257 --> 41:06.759
Move your crystals around the house.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.593
Bye.

41:07.634 --> 41:08.427
- Bye.
- Don't go chasing waterfalls.

41:08.469 --> 41:12.181
Okay, bye.

41:13.057 --> 41:15.392
What the fuck is going on?

41:16.435 --> 41:17.227
What?

41:17.269 --> 41:18.979
No, don't treat me like an actor.

41:19.021 --> 41:20.856
We all know that method acting is just

41:20.898 --> 41:23.358
made up shit to justify bad behavior.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.819
Who's being naughty costars
having secret meetings then?

41:25.861 --> 41:28.697
Okay, we're not, we're just,
we just haven't hung up yet.

41:28.739 --> 41:31.408
We're not having a meeting, Declan.

41:31.450 --> 41:34.036
Shit's goin' down isn't it?

41:34.078 --> 41:36.038
Oh my god, it is.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.248
Fuck, I knew I wasn't tripping last night.

41:38.290 --> 41:40.501
Like I was tripping,
but I wasn't tripping.

41:40.542 --> 41:41.335
Declan, this isn't funny.

41:41.377 --> 41:42.169
Okay, it's serious.

41:42.211 --> 41:43.629
Yeah, she obviously got carried away.

41:43.670 --> 41:45.005
I mean, if anybody's gonna do it

41:45.047 --> 41:46.090
it's gonna be a bunch of actors.

41:46.131 --> 41:47.216
Well, I didn't get carried away.

41:47.257 --> 41:48.717
We all know I'm not that good.

41:48.759 --> 41:49.635
Exactly.

41:49.676 --> 41:51.512
No, I felt something
weird last night, too.

41:51.553 --> 41:54.640
Okay, I just felt like
this wind wash over me.

41:54.681 --> 41:57.893
Did you maybe leave a
window open, possibly?

41:57.935 --> 42:00.145
Kip, you know how
sensitive I am to this stuff?

42:00.187 --> 42:01.772
Okay, so don't-

42:01.814 --> 42:04.983
Okay, what are you saying then, Kel?

42:05.859 --> 42:07.277
Are you really gonna make me say it?

42:07.319 --> 42:09.029
I'll say it.

42:09.071 --> 42:10.739
Something ooky spooky's goin' on.

42:10.781 --> 42:13.909
oh come, Come on, you guys.

42:13.951 --> 42:16.370
I mean, Kelly, what's more believable?

42:16.412 --> 42:18.580
Chrissy overacting or that she's

42:18.622 --> 42:20.999
boxing with zombies in her apartment.

42:21.041 --> 42:23.127
Don't play to the judge, okay?

42:23.168 --> 42:24.336
That's actually a good idea.

42:24.378 --> 42:25.921
That would make a good movie.

42:25.963 --> 42:27.297
You know, like a bunch of people

42:27.339 --> 42:28.799
go out to make a horror movie

42:28.841 --> 42:31.301
and then real shit
starts happening to them.

42:31.343 --> 42:32.845
It feels very meta.

42:32.886 --> 42:34.179
One too many metas.

42:34.221 --> 42:35.681
You know, this is making me think

42:35.723 --> 42:38.267
that that shadow she
did, that it wasn't fake.

42:38.308 --> 42:39.101
True.

42:39.143 --> 42:40.185
Oh, Kel, come on.

42:40.227 --> 42:41.895
You saw Alex's tape from last night.

42:41.937 --> 42:43.814
She did the exact same thing.

42:43.856 --> 42:44.648
Me, what?

42:44.690 --> 42:45.774
No, I didn't.

42:46.775 --> 42:47.568
What?

42:47.609 --> 42:48.569
- I didn't.
- Wait, are you,

42:48.610 --> 42:49.403
are you kidding?

42:49.445 --> 42:50.237
Are you fucking with me?

42:50.279 --> 42:51.113
No, I'm being,

42:51.155 --> 42:52.406
no I'm being serious.

42:52.448 --> 42:53.407
What are you talking about?

42:53.449 --> 42:54.867
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

42:54.908 --> 42:55.701
You guys are crazy.

42:55.743 --> 42:57.953
Here, let, I'll pull it up.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.461
What the fuck is that?

43:05.502 --> 43:06.420
Wait.

43:06.462 --> 43:08.672
Zoom in and enhance that.

43:08.714 --> 43:10.007
- I can't-
- Oh my god.

43:10.049 --> 43:11.508
She does one episode of CSI

43:11.550 --> 43:14.053
and thinks zoom in and
enhance it is a thing.

43:14.094 --> 43:17.222
Okay, I mean, it's
obviously the ceiling fan.

43:17.264 --> 43:18.849
You guys, they just installed the light

43:18.891 --> 43:20.059
too close to the fan, right?

43:20.100 --> 43:21.018
- Are you serious?
- So you didn't,

43:21.060 --> 43:22.144
you didn't make that,

43:22.186 --> 43:23.353
- you didn't make that shadow?
- Okay, you know what?

43:23.395 --> 43:25.147
You guys are tryin' to scare
me and it's not gonna work.

43:25.189 --> 43:25.981
I'm leaving.

43:26.023 --> 43:27.232
- Bye.
- You two are just fucked.

43:27.274 --> 43:28.067
Okay?

43:28.108 --> 43:28.901
You're fucked.

43:28.942 --> 43:30.736
Both of you, fucked.

43:30.778 --> 43:31.779
And let me tell you something,

43:31.820 --> 43:33.447
I don't like this one bit.

43:33.489 --> 43:34.281
Okay, close your window

43:34.323 --> 43:36.909
- before you go to bed.
- Goodbye.

43:38.327 --> 43:40.871
Personally, and this is just me,

43:40.913 --> 43:43.791
but I think it's fucking great.

43:43.832 --> 43:45.834
I know.

43:45.876 --> 43:46.960
We are losing it.

43:54.885 --> 43:56.804
Kip, what time is it?

43:57.721 --> 44:00.015
I'm sorry, it's late
or early, I don't know.

44:00.057 --> 44:02.101
Look, something really
weird just happened.

44:02.142 --> 44:03.727
What?

44:03.769 --> 44:06.438
Chrissy just uploaded a video.

44:07.523 --> 44:08.607
So call Chrissy.

44:08.649 --> 44:12.361
No, listen, she's sleeping in the video.

44:12.403 --> 44:14.863
It's like the camera's
moving, but she's sleeping.

44:14.905 --> 44:17.950
It's really fucking creepy.

44:17.991 --> 44:19.660
Come on, that doesn't make any sense.

44:19.701 --> 44:21.620
You can't upload footage

44:21.662 --> 44:22.454
- when you're unconscious.
- No, that's

44:22.496 --> 44:23.497
not what I'm saying.

44:23.539 --> 44:25.040
It's just, I don't know.

44:25.082 --> 44:28.460
It looks like someone else is there.

44:28.502 --> 44:30.087
What do you mean?

44:31.338 --> 44:32.965
- Okay, hold on.
- Just send it to me.

44:33.006 --> 44:34.425
I'm gonna show you.

45:29.813 --> 45:33.067
Damn, I mean, she really went for it.

45:34.359 --> 45:35.194
I mean, she's good.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.153
Have you shown Kelly?

45:36.195 --> 45:37.613
She's gonna shit her pants.

45:37.654 --> 45:40.282
No, no, I didn't show Kelly.

45:40.324 --> 45:41.450
No.

45:41.492 --> 45:42.534
I mean, come on, Kip,

45:42.576 --> 45:44.912
she obviously just got Max to
go over there and shoot it.

45:44.953 --> 45:46.371
And I mean, it works.

45:46.413 --> 45:47.414
It's a hell of a lot better

45:47.456 --> 45:49.917
than just holding the camera yourself.

45:49.958 --> 45:54.630
Okay, yeah, but no, that's
that's not like Chrissy.

45:54.671 --> 45:57.132
I mean, she wouldn't do that.

45:57.174 --> 45:59.093
What, you think it's Casper?

45:59.134 --> 46:01.345
I mean, what, who are you, Kelly?

46:01.387 --> 46:04.306
Okay, I'm not saying
it's a ghost or something.

46:04.348 --> 46:07.643
It's just, I don't know, it's
not like Chrissy to do that.

46:07.684 --> 46:10.354
And it's really frickin' creepy.

46:11.772 --> 46:14.191
Fine, just call the others.

46:21.031 --> 46:24.743
Sorry for waking you,
Kip's having a fit.

46:24.785 --> 46:26.370
It's all good.

46:26.412 --> 46:27.871
I was just chasin' the worm.

46:27.913 --> 46:29.331
Who still smokes?

46:30.833 --> 46:32.376
You said worm.

46:32.418 --> 46:35.045
Well, there he is, our
very own Dean Cundey.

46:36.672 --> 46:38.048
Who is Dean Cundey?

46:38.090 --> 46:40.509
Dude, he shot "Halloween,"

46:40.551 --> 46:41.343
"Back to the Future,"

46:41.385 --> 46:42.594
"Jurassic Park."

46:42.636 --> 46:44.888
Oh my God, what the fuck
is Lesly teaching you?

46:44.930 --> 46:46.056
Don't speak to-

46:46.098 --> 46:47.474
- Okay, where's Chrissy?

46:47.516 --> 46:49.727
He said he doesn't
know, he hasn't seen her.

46:49.768 --> 46:50.686
Bullshit.

46:50.728 --> 46:52.062
I swear on my mother's life.

46:52.104 --> 46:53.355
I just woke up.

46:53.397 --> 46:54.189
Do you see-

46:54.231 --> 46:56.608
Okay, wait, wait, wait, Max.

46:56.650 --> 46:58.318
Swear on Lesly's.

47:00.195 --> 47:03.615
Have any of you even tried to call her?

47:04.783 --> 47:05.993
Seriously?

47:06.034 --> 47:08.412
Oh my God, what the fuck
is wrong with all of you?

47:08.454 --> 47:11.373
Okay, Max, if she's not
with you, then who is?

47:11.415 --> 47:12.916
Why do you keep asking me?

47:12.958 --> 47:14.168
Yo?

47:14.209 --> 47:16.420
Yeah, get in the meeting room.

47:16.462 --> 47:17.379
Okay, bye.

47:17.421 --> 47:18.422
She's coming.

47:18.464 --> 47:19.840
So she's fine.

47:19.882 --> 47:20.883
She's fine.

47:22.342 --> 47:25.554
Will someone please tell
me what the hell is going on?

47:25.596 --> 47:26.513
I was asleep.

47:26.555 --> 47:28.098
Do you know how many pills I had to take

47:28.140 --> 47:29.433
to make that happen?

47:29.475 --> 47:31.685
A pharmacy worth.

47:31.727 --> 47:33.145
Look, there she is.

47:33.187 --> 47:34.646
- Hey, guys.
- Chrissy.

47:34.688 --> 47:35.898
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

47:35.939 --> 47:37.024
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:37.066 --> 47:38.901
Mmhmm, oh my God, you guys.

47:38.942 --> 47:40.235
I had the best dream.

47:40.277 --> 47:42.029
I'm gonna journal it later as soon as

47:42.071 --> 47:43.697
- we're done with this.
- Are you alone right now?

47:43.739 --> 47:45.657
Yes, Max, I am alone.

47:47.034 --> 47:48.410
What kind of a question is that?

47:48.452 --> 47:49.411
Listen, a video of you

47:49.453 --> 47:50.746
- got uploaded to-
- What?

47:50.788 --> 47:52.039
What video?

47:52.081 --> 47:54.208
I swear, I deleted all those.

47:54.249 --> 47:55.376
No.

47:55.417 --> 47:56.794
Oh my god, the one time I drank tequila.

47:56.835 --> 47:57.628
Wait, wait, wait a minute,

47:57.669 --> 47:58.545
let's talk about that for a minute.

47:58.587 --> 47:59.380
- What?
- No, Chrissy,

47:59.421 --> 48:01.006
it was a video of you sleeping.

48:01.048 --> 48:03.717
Yeah, it was like an hour ago.

48:04.676 --> 48:05.761
Wait, what?

48:07.971 --> 48:09.681
Okay, all right, hold on.

48:09.723 --> 48:11.809
Let me pull it up.

48:11.850 --> 48:12.893
I don't.

48:12.935 --> 48:13.727
What videos were you-

48:13.769 --> 48:15.145
- I'm confused.

48:15.187 --> 48:15.979
Me, too.

48:18.899 --> 48:20.609
Oh my God, that's my house.

48:21.902 --> 48:23.612
Okay, who's filming it, though?

48:23.654 --> 48:24.822
Like what the?

48:24.863 --> 48:26.865
Chrissy, you're obviously doing that.

48:26.907 --> 48:28.242
It's not me.

48:28.283 --> 48:29.743
It's like so weird.

48:31.620 --> 48:32.538
Cute jacket.

48:37.501 --> 48:38.544
You see?

48:38.585 --> 48:39.586
Oh my god.

48:40.838 --> 48:42.715
Wait a minute.

48:42.756 --> 48:43.549
You-

48:43.590 --> 48:44.383
- See it's not me.
- Come on, Max.

48:44.425 --> 48:46.927
- I told you.
- That's not you?

48:48.637 --> 48:51.515
Whoa, what the fuck?

48:55.394 --> 48:57.146
I didn't film that.

48:57.187 --> 48:57.980
What the fuck?

48:58.939 --> 48:59.940
- Oh my god, guys.
- Was it?

48:59.982 --> 49:01.108
I didn't film that.

49:01.150 --> 49:01.984
I told you all,

49:02.025 --> 49:04.528
but nobody ever trusts a pretty blonde.

49:04.570 --> 49:05.529
Fuckin' told you.

49:05.571 --> 49:06.363
What am I gonna do?

49:06.405 --> 49:07.614
Okay, okay, we need to calm down, okay?

49:07.656 --> 49:08.449
- Okay-
- No, no,

49:08.490 --> 49:09.533
we do not need to be calm.

49:09.575 --> 49:11.118
We need to call the cops right now.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.661
Whoever did that could
still be in your house.

49:12.703 --> 49:13.495
What?

49:13.537 --> 49:14.705
Why would you say that to her?

49:14.747 --> 49:16.790
911, Chrissy, now.

49:16.832 --> 49:18.584
Max, Max, this isn't funny anymore.

49:18.625 --> 49:20.044
If you were actually there
and you actually shot it,

49:20.085 --> 49:21.045
- fucking say something.
- I'm not fuckin',

49:21.086 --> 49:22.463
why am I fucking around
tell her to call the cops?

49:22.504 --> 49:23.297
I'm not kidding.

49:23.338 --> 49:25.090
911,
what is your emergency?

49:25.132 --> 49:27.760
Hi, yeah, is this 911?

49:27.801 --> 49:28.594
What?

49:28.635 --> 49:29.678
- Wait, shit.
- Chrissy.

49:29.720 --> 49:30.512
- Fuck.
- Where'd she go?

49:30.554 --> 49:31.346
Where'd she go, where'd she go?

49:31.388 --> 49:32.181
- Where'd she go?
- Somebody call her.

49:32.222 --> 49:33.348
Somebody call her.

49:33.390 --> 49:34.391
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

49:34.433 --> 49:35.225
It's not gonna work

49:35.267 --> 49:36.393
if we're all calling her at the same time.

49:36.435 --> 49:37.227
Good point, Declan.

49:37.269 --> 49:39.354
Well, who's calling?

49:39.396 --> 49:40.606
I am, just hold on.

49:40.647 --> 49:41.857
Okay, she's calling me.

49:41.899 --> 49:44.276
Hey, what the fuck happened?

49:44.318 --> 49:47.029
My computer died, sorry.

49:47.071 --> 49:48.739
Oh my god.

49:48.781 --> 49:50.282
Her computer died.

49:51.700 --> 49:52.743
Jesus.

49:52.785 --> 49:53.702
Oh god.

49:53.744 --> 49:54.995
Are you okay?

49:56.205 --> 49:58.373
Yeah, I mean, no,

49:58.415 --> 50:00.501
but they're sending cops.

50:01.585 --> 50:02.836
They're sending a cop.

50:02.878 --> 50:04.046
Oh God.

50:04.088 --> 50:07.424
Declan, Declan, I don't know what to do.

50:07.466 --> 50:09.051
Why did you hang up from the police?

50:09.093 --> 50:10.928
To call you guys back.

50:10.969 --> 50:11.887
This is super fucked,

50:11.929 --> 50:12.721
- you guys.
- I don't think

50:12.763 --> 50:13.555
we can help you.

50:13.597 --> 50:16.517
Ask her if she wants me
to go over to her house.

50:16.558 --> 50:18.560
I can see you, dickhead.

50:19.561 --> 50:22.731
Max wants to know if
he should come over.

50:23.982 --> 50:24.775
What was that?

50:24.817 --> 50:25.609
What was that?

50:25.651 --> 50:26.443
What the fuck?

50:26.485 --> 50:28.153
Shhh, shhh, you guys, guys.

50:28.195 --> 50:29.321
What the fuck was that?

50:29.363 --> 50:31.156
I think somebody's in my room.

50:33.242 --> 50:35.285
- What's she saying?
- What's going on?

50:35.327 --> 50:36.120
Declan, talk to us.

50:36.161 --> 50:38.330
What's happening, man?

50:38.372 --> 50:40.958
Is she using the pendulum again?

50:40.999 --> 50:43.669
No, stop using that thing.

50:43.711 --> 50:45.963
Okay, I'm gonna look.

50:46.004 --> 50:46.922
No, no, no.

50:46.964 --> 50:47.756
- Did she just say she was gonna look?
- No no no.

50:47.798 --> 50:48.966
No no no no.

50:49.007 --> 50:50.884
- Stay where you are.
- No.

50:50.926 --> 50:51.719
Chrissy.

51:02.354 --> 51:03.981
Can you tell her to
stop shaking the camera?

51:04.022 --> 51:05.607
Kelly, shut the fuck up.

51:05.649 --> 51:07.192
What, it's making me nauseous.

51:07.234 --> 51:08.986
Chrissy, just get the fuck out of there.

51:09.027 --> 51:09.820
I am trying.

51:09.862 --> 51:10.654
Would you be quiet?

51:18.078 --> 51:21.957
Oh sweet Jesus, what is that?

51:21.999 --> 51:25.002
- Don't put it down.
- Shut up, Declan.

51:27.838 --> 51:29.006
I trained for this.

51:29.048 --> 51:31.300
- Oh god, no.
- No, no, no.

51:31.341 --> 51:33.761
Just because you played a ninja on TV.

51:33.802 --> 51:34.845
Why do you have that?

51:34.887 --> 51:36.346
What could she possibly do with that?

51:36.388 --> 51:38.182
Why do you have a samurai sword?

51:38.223 --> 51:39.933
Relax you guys.

51:39.975 --> 51:41.268
The stunt guy said that I was good enough

51:41.310 --> 51:42.686
to be a professional.

51:42.728 --> 51:44.480
No, he had to say that to you.

51:44.521 --> 51:45.606
They were being nice.

51:45.647 --> 51:49.151
That was pretend fighting, Chrissy, no.

51:51.403 --> 51:52.863
- Christ.
- Shit.

51:52.905 --> 51:54.031
What was that?

51:54.073 --> 51:54.865
Chrissy, what was that?

51:54.907 --> 51:57.159
It came from the kitchen.

51:59.203 --> 52:00.370
Well don't go in there.

52:00.412 --> 52:01.371
Get your stuff and get out of the house.

52:01.413 --> 52:03.457
Get out of the house.

52:03.499 --> 52:05.584
Jesus, Chrissy, what are you doing?

52:05.626 --> 52:07.544
Why are you looking for him?

52:07.586 --> 52:08.420
Run.

52:15.386 --> 52:17.846
Is that thing even sharp?

52:17.888 --> 52:18.722
Um,

52:21.517 --> 52:22.559
no.

52:22.601 --> 52:24.812
Kip, Kip, Kip, you should
be writing all this down.

52:24.853 --> 52:26.480
Are you kidding me right now?

52:26.522 --> 52:27.314
Now is not the time.

52:27.356 --> 52:28.148
Don't worry about it.

52:28.190 --> 52:28.982
I'm on it.

52:29.024 --> 52:29.942
Oh you piece of shit.

52:29.983 --> 52:31.110
Okay, you're not getting
a writing credit, though.

52:31.151 --> 52:32.277
I'm just saying.

52:35.447 --> 52:36.740
But this is.

52:36.782 --> 52:38.367
- Oh my God, oh my God.
- No, no, no.

52:38.409 --> 52:39.660
- Now we're talking, yes.
- You should not be allowed

52:39.701 --> 52:40.953
- to play with grown up knives.
- Yes.

52:40.994 --> 52:42.496
Be careful you don't stab yourself.

52:42.538 --> 52:45.416
Okay, listen, Declan,
tell those assholes

52:45.457 --> 52:47.876
that I can still hear them.

52:47.918 --> 52:48.752
Kinda.

52:50.504 --> 52:52.589
She says she can still hear you guys.

53:15.195 --> 53:19.032
Okay, honestly, I am
literally losing my mind.

53:20.784 --> 53:22.035
No, I don't, I don't,

53:22.077 --> 53:22.953
I don't think you are.

53:22.995 --> 53:24.204
I heard something, too.

53:24.246 --> 53:26.832
Declan, there is nobody here.

53:29.168 --> 53:31.253
Are you guys playing a trick on me?

53:31.295 --> 53:33.213
No, you just need to go
back to your room, and-

53:33.255 --> 53:34.131
- These pranks aren't funny, okay?

53:35.716 --> 53:36.550
Shit.

53:37.634 --> 53:39.053
Fuck.

53:41.930 --> 53:43.348
I think it's the cops.

53:43.390 --> 53:44.433
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

53:44.475 --> 53:45.684
That was way too quick.

53:45.726 --> 53:46.518
Don't answer it.

53:46.560 --> 53:48.270
The police are here, it's fine.

53:48.312 --> 53:49.646
Chrissy, don't answer it.

53:49.688 --> 53:51.106
Declan-

53:51.148 --> 53:51.899
- Okay, wait, wait-
- No no no,

53:51.940 --> 53:52.733
- don't put your phone down.
- Chrissy,

53:52.775 --> 53:53.567
maybe you should just-

53:53.609 --> 53:54.401
- Just bring it with you so we can-

53:54.443 --> 53:56.278
- Bring your phone, bring your phone.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.072
Also, no more shrooms.

53:58.113 --> 53:59.156
Who else would it be?

53:59.198 --> 54:00.032
Come on.

54:02.701 --> 54:04.119
Guys, I don't like
this, I don't like this.

54:04.161 --> 54:06.330
Can someone call the cops?

54:07.790 --> 54:08.582
Wait, no.

54:15.214 --> 54:16.048
Chrissy.

54:17.549 --> 54:20.177
Oh my god, oh my god, no.

54:24.223 --> 54:25.015
What are you doing?

54:25.057 --> 54:26.266
Chrissy, stop doing that!

54:29.311 --> 54:30.104
Chrissy.

54:37.444 --> 54:38.404
Chrissy.

54:38.445 --> 54:39.863
What just happened?

54:39.905 --> 54:41.657
What is happening?

54:44.701 --> 54:45.953
What the?

54:48.956 --> 54:49.706
What the fuck?

54:49.748 --> 54:50.541
What the fuck?

55:01.260 --> 55:03.345
What the fuck was that?

55:04.638 --> 55:07.599
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:07.641 --> 55:09.560
Oh my god, oh my god.

55:10.894 --> 55:13.480
I just, I just saw someone die.

55:15.649 --> 55:16.483
Oh god.

55:17.860 --> 55:20.320
Okay, I'm gonna call the cops.

55:20.362 --> 55:23.031
That was fuckin' weird.

55:23.073 --> 55:24.658
Where's Alex?

55:24.700 --> 55:26.076
I am never gonna unsee that.

55:26.118 --> 55:27.953
I'm gonna have to carry
that with me forever.

55:27.995 --> 55:29.913
Shut up, where's Alex?

55:29.955 --> 55:32.040
- Guys, guys, I'm so sorry.
- Oh my god.

55:32.082 --> 55:34.293
- I'm so sorry.
- Where did you go?

55:34.334 --> 55:35.836
ALl of my power went out.

55:35.878 --> 55:37.129
Like even my phone.

55:37.171 --> 55:37.963
I don't know what happened.

55:38.005 --> 55:38.797
That was so weird.

55:38.839 --> 55:39.631
Dude, not cool.

55:39.673 --> 55:40.466
What did I miss?

55:40.507 --> 55:41.300
Is Chrissy okay?

55:41.341 --> 55:42.134
No, Chrissy's dead.

55:42.176 --> 55:42.968
Dead?

55:43.010 --> 55:43.802
What do you mean dead?

55:43.844 --> 55:44.636
She's fine.

55:44.678 --> 55:45.471
What?

55:45.512 --> 55:46.305
What?

55:46.346 --> 55:47.139
She's fine.

55:47.181 --> 55:48.223
The police said that she called back

55:48.265 --> 55:51.101
three minutes after the
original call to cancel it.

55:51.143 --> 55:52.144
Wait what?

55:52.186 --> 55:52.978
No.

55:53.020 --> 55:53.812
We fuckin' saw it.

55:53.854 --> 55:57.107
No, no, I was still on
the phone to her then.

55:57.149 --> 55:58.776
It would have been after you hung up.

55:58.817 --> 55:59.985
What an asshole.

56:00.027 --> 56:01.070
Why would she do that to us?

56:01.111 --> 56:03.572
Will someone please
tell me what is going on?

56:03.614 --> 56:08.619
Chrissy was strangled with her own hand.

56:08.911 --> 56:09.703
Okay, you guys,

56:09.745 --> 56:10.746
- this is really fucked up.
- And then-

56:10.788 --> 56:11.663
- You know what?

56:11.705 --> 56:12.498
I'm goin' over there.

56:12.539 --> 56:13.332
Oh geez.

56:13.373 --> 56:14.792
Declan, come on man.

56:14.833 --> 56:16.043
That's not a good idea.

56:16.085 --> 56:19.171
No, that does not sound
like a good idea at all.

56:19.213 --> 56:21.173
I mean, what if there's
someone still in the house?

56:21.215 --> 56:22.049
Who?

56:23.759 --> 56:24.968
And there he goes.

56:25.010 --> 56:28.764
Look, I am just saying, okay, Declan

56:28.806 --> 56:31.141
is a bit of a wiener.

56:31.183 --> 56:33.018
Like, what is he-

56:33.060 --> 56:34.603
- Okay, Max, Max, we get it.
- Really going to do?

56:34.645 --> 56:36.939
Why don't you just go ahead
and go over there yourself?

56:36.980 --> 56:39.149
- No, no.
- You should both go.

56:39.191 --> 56:39.983
This is not fake.

56:40.025 --> 56:40.984
It's not fake.

56:41.026 --> 56:42.486
Oh, Kelly, come on.

56:42.528 --> 56:44.321
Shut up, Alex.

56:44.363 --> 56:45.406
She strangled herself.

56:45.447 --> 56:46.865
That's physically impossible.

56:46.907 --> 56:48.784
If that's not some supernatural shit

56:48.826 --> 56:50.244
then I don't know what is.

56:50.285 --> 56:52.996
Super, okay, then why is
it only attacking Chrissy

56:53.038 --> 56:54.665
and not all of us?

56:54.706 --> 56:55.749
Right?

56:55.791 --> 56:57.251
We all did the spell.

56:57.292 --> 56:58.669
Fuck.

56:58.711 --> 57:00.254
It's the fucking pendulum.

57:00.295 --> 57:01.672
Fuck, oh my god.

57:01.714 --> 57:02.673
I was right.

57:02.715 --> 57:04.967
I was, I was right.

57:05.008 --> 57:05.801
All along.

57:05.843 --> 57:06.635
I was right.

57:06.677 --> 57:08.721
Again, fuckin' right, fuckin' pendulum.

57:08.762 --> 57:09.805
Oh my god.

57:18.313 --> 57:19.148
Chrissy.

57:22.234 --> 57:23.861
Chrissy.

57:23.902 --> 57:24.737
Hello.

57:30.576 --> 57:31.952
Chrissy, come on, this isn't funny.

57:42.254 --> 57:44.423
Okay, we're glad you're not dead.

57:48.594 --> 57:51.013
Okay, Chrissy, good talk.

57:58.604 --> 58:01.815
Hold on just one sec,
Chrissy, Kelly's callin'.

58:01.857 --> 58:02.941
I'll merge us.

58:07.613 --> 58:08.572
Hey, Kel.

58:08.614 --> 58:09.865
I want an apology.

58:09.907 --> 58:12.076
No, it's, Chrissy's fine, okay?

58:12.117 --> 58:13.202
She just called me.

58:13.243 --> 58:14.119
She's on the other line.

58:14.161 --> 58:15.788
Hold on, I'll just, I'll merge us.

58:15.829 --> 58:18.749
Hold on, hold on, one sec, one sec.

58:22.836 --> 58:24.380
Where is she?

58:25.381 --> 58:26.757
You know, I don't know.

58:26.799 --> 58:28.050
I actually haven't seen her yet,

58:28.092 --> 58:30.594
but this is her apartment, so.

58:45.275 --> 58:46.110
Chrissy.

58:46.985 --> 58:48.153
She's alive.

58:50.406 --> 58:51.824
Wow, she can act.

59:25.232 --> 59:27.568
Wait, how did he get there so fast?

59:27.609 --> 59:30.028
You idiots know we're
not filming this, right?

59:30.070 --> 59:31.238
You called us.

59:32.114 --> 59:33.240
Hey.

59:45.377 --> 59:46.920
What is he doing?

59:46.962 --> 59:48.130
I have no idea.

59:48.172 --> 59:49.298
This is weird.

59:56.972 --> 59:58.474
Again, with the strangling.

1:00:23.582 --> 1:00:27.252
- Okay, that was kinda creepy.
- What the fuck?

1:00:30.047 --> 1:00:31.590
I'm calling him.

1:00:39.723 --> 1:00:41.642
Do you guys know how
dangerous it is to call people

1:00:41.683 --> 1:00:43.310
while they're driving?

1:00:43.352 --> 1:00:44.144
You piece of shit.

1:00:44.186 --> 1:00:45.979
What the hell is wrong with you?

1:00:46.021 --> 1:00:47.314
What?

1:00:47.356 --> 1:00:49.024
We saw Chrissy strangle herself,

1:00:49.066 --> 1:00:50.651
and you were there.

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:53.737
Yeah, I know I was on
the same call as you.

1:00:53.779 --> 1:00:58.575
No, no, you were there, and
she strangled herself again.

1:00:58.617 --> 1:00:59.827
Fucking crazy town over here.

1:00:59.868 --> 1:01:00.702
What?

1:01:02.329 --> 1:01:04.915
Where the fuck are you?

1:01:04.957 --> 1:01:08.085
I'm going through West Hollywood.

1:01:08.127 --> 1:01:10.087
Well, show us.

1:01:10.129 --> 1:01:10.921
What?

1:01:10.963 --> 1:01:11.797
Show us.

1:01:14.341 --> 1:01:15.175
What?

1:01:16.009 --> 1:01:16.927
Wait, he's not even,

1:01:16.969 --> 1:01:18.220
he's not even close.

1:01:18.262 --> 1:01:19.471
Yeah, I just said that.

1:01:19.513 --> 1:01:21.598
I'm still like 20 minutes away.

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:23.392
Declan you need to get
over there right now.

1:01:23.434 --> 1:01:25.102
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

1:01:25.144 --> 1:01:27.187
but it's some weird magic shit,

1:01:27.229 --> 1:01:30.190
and just get over there and call me.

1:01:36.238 --> 1:01:37.156
I'm here.

1:02:04.224 --> 1:02:05.684
I swear to god, if
she's fucking with us,

1:02:05.726 --> 1:02:06.643
I will kill her myself.

1:02:26.205 --> 1:02:28.040
No, something feels weird.

1:02:28.082 --> 1:02:29.333
Knock, maybe.

1:02:33.003 --> 1:02:34.505
Why do you have a key to Chrissy's?

1:02:34.546 --> 1:02:36.173
Max, shut up?

1:02:36.215 --> 1:02:37.007
Dude.

1:02:37.049 --> 1:02:38.008
She gave me one when we dated.

1:02:38.050 --> 1:02:39.176
You are the worst.

1:02:44.473 --> 1:02:45.307
Oh my god.

1:02:47.851 --> 1:02:48.894
I see her.

1:02:51.105 --> 1:02:51.897
What?

1:02:51.939 --> 1:02:53.357
She's not moving.

1:02:53.399 --> 1:02:54.942
Okay, she's pretending.

1:02:54.983 --> 1:02:56.527
Go in there and poke her.

1:02:56.568 --> 1:02:57.361
Are you insane?

1:02:57.403 --> 1:02:58.195
I'm not going in there.

1:02:58.237 --> 1:02:59.363
She's messing with you.

1:02:59.405 --> 1:03:00.864
Declan, she's not dead.

1:03:02.950 --> 1:03:03.951
Oh my god.

1:03:03.992 --> 1:03:05.911
Do something, Declan.

1:03:11.750 --> 1:03:14.336
Oh god, she's not moving.

1:03:14.378 --> 1:03:15.587
She should have moved.

1:03:18.674 --> 1:03:19.508
Fuck.

1:03:20.384 --> 1:03:21.176
Oh my god.

1:03:21.218 --> 1:03:23.512
Oh my god, why is she doing this to me?

1:03:23.554 --> 1:03:24.930
She should have moved, guys.

1:03:24.972 --> 1:03:26.932
- She should have moved.
- Are you sure, Declan?

1:03:26.974 --> 1:03:28.350
What do I do? What do I do?

1:03:28.392 --> 1:03:29.184
- What do I do?
- Just don't touch

1:03:29.226 --> 1:03:30.561
anything and just get out of there.

1:03:30.602 --> 1:03:31.395
Okay?

1:03:31.437 --> 1:03:32.229
Do you want me to call the cops?

1:03:32.271 --> 1:03:33.147
Is that gonna make you feel better?

1:03:33.188 --> 1:03:34.648
- Have someone come over?
- No, no, no, no, no, wait.

1:03:34.690 --> 1:03:35.899
You need to get the pendulum.

1:03:35.941 --> 1:03:37.067
Kelly enough with

1:03:37.109 --> 1:03:38.152
- the pendulum.
- Get the pendulum.

1:03:38.193 --> 1:03:39.862
I know it has something to do with this.

1:03:39.903 --> 1:03:41.822
I'm not stealing from
our dead costar, Kelly.

1:03:41.864 --> 1:03:43.323
Just do it, you little piss wipe.

1:03:43.365 --> 1:03:45.033
It may be the only way we can figure out

1:03:45.075 --> 1:03:46.660
what the fuck is going on.

1:03:46.702 --> 1:03:47.494
So do it.

1:03:47.536 --> 1:03:49.580
You go in there, and be a man, and get it.

1:03:49.621 --> 1:03:50.539
Fuck you.

1:04:01.967 --> 1:04:03.844
You guys, you fuckin' owe me.

1:04:03.886 --> 1:04:04.887
Thank god.

1:04:08.515 --> 1:04:09.683
Did you guys hear that?

1:04:09.725 --> 1:04:10.517
Hear what?

1:04:10.559 --> 1:04:11.852
- What?
- You-

1:04:11.894 --> 1:04:13.062
- What, what?

1:04:13.103 --> 1:04:14.313
- Hear-
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:04:14.354 --> 1:04:16.106
Have any of you guys
watched a horror movie?

1:04:16.148 --> 1:04:18.108
Declan, just get out of there.

1:04:18.150 --> 1:04:19.151
Wait, shut up.

1:04:26.533 --> 1:04:27.910
I think there's someone in there.

1:04:27.951 --> 1:04:30.788
What do you
mean someone's in there?

1:04:30.829 --> 1:04:32.456
What are we looking at?

1:04:32.498 --> 1:04:33.415
Right there.

1:04:33.457 --> 1:04:34.249
Right past her body.

1:04:34.291 --> 1:04:35.084
See that shadow?

1:04:35.125 --> 1:04:35.918
- Right where?
- Where, where, where?

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:37.294
What are you talking about?

1:04:37.336 --> 1:04:38.962
Fuck.

1:04:39.004 --> 1:04:41.757
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?

1:04:42.841 --> 1:04:44.009
Is that a guy?

1:04:45.135 --> 1:04:46.762
Okay, okay, just
fucking get out of there

1:04:46.804 --> 1:04:47.596
Declan.

1:04:47.638 --> 1:04:49.598
It's not funny anymore.

1:04:56.897 --> 1:04:57.731
My god.

1:04:59.233 --> 1:05:00.067
Oh my god.

1:05:02.194 --> 1:05:03.821
Her body's gone.

1:05:03.862 --> 1:05:04.655
What?

1:05:04.696 --> 1:05:06.156
What do you, what do
you mean her body's gone.

1:05:06.198 --> 1:05:07.199
How does a dead body walk away?

1:05:07.241 --> 1:05:09.410
I don't know, it's gone.

1:05:11.870 --> 1:05:13.747
What the fuck?

1:05:13.789 --> 1:05:16.333
Maybe she walked away.

1:05:16.375 --> 1:05:18.252
I mean, how did she just get up there?

1:05:21.130 --> 1:05:23.549
Holy shit, that was good.

1:05:36.812 --> 1:05:37.855
Don't be ridiculous.

1:05:37.896 --> 1:05:39.148
They must be working together.

1:05:39.189 --> 1:05:40.441
- Don't you dare.
- Obviously.

1:05:40.482 --> 1:05:41.233
Enough with the whole

1:05:41.275 --> 1:05:44.945
it was a fucking turntable
and a fan bullshit.

1:05:44.987 --> 1:05:47.197
That bitch got possessed
and she killed herself.

1:05:47.239 --> 1:05:49.074
- Kelly's right.
- Or Declan killed her.

1:05:49.116 --> 1:05:49.950
I don't know, but something

1:05:49.992 --> 1:05:51.118
- fucking happened.
- I didn't kill her.

1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:52.453
And you know what, Kip,

1:05:52.494 --> 1:05:54.830
I am sick and tired of being told

1:05:54.872 --> 1:05:57.040
that because I am a woman I am crazy.

1:05:57.082 --> 1:05:58.459
We're not crazy.

1:05:58.500 --> 1:05:59.835
- We're the only ones who-
- Kelly, shoosh,

1:05:59.877 --> 1:06:00.836
- shoosh shoosh shoosh.
- What are you talking about?

1:06:00.878 --> 1:06:02.671
Shoosh shoosh shoosh shoosh
shoosh, guys, it's my manager.

1:06:02.713 --> 1:06:03.714
Hold on, hold on.

1:06:05.924 --> 1:06:08.218
Hey Alissa, yeah.

1:06:08.260 --> 1:06:10.512
Yeah, I have a minute, mmhmm.

1:06:10.554 --> 1:06:11.388
Okay.

1:06:12.598 --> 1:06:13.807
Wait.

1:06:13.849 --> 1:06:15.100
You're serious?

1:06:17.019 --> 1:06:19.104
That's amazing news.

1:06:19.146 --> 1:06:20.230
Yeah.

1:06:20.272 --> 1:06:22.483
Okay, yeah, yeah, we'll
talk about it more tomorrow.

1:06:22.524 --> 1:06:23.942
Okay, you let me, I'll call you.

1:06:23.984 --> 1:06:24.777
You call me.

1:06:24.818 --> 1:06:25.611
I'll call you.

1:06:25.652 --> 1:06:27.613
Okay, yeah, okay, bye.

1:06:29.031 --> 1:06:30.407
- Holy shit.
- Are you kidding?

1:06:30.449 --> 1:06:31.825
Do not mute us.

1:06:31.867 --> 1:06:33.660
- That is so rude.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:06:33.702 --> 1:06:35.245
I'm sorry, I'm sorry guys, guys, listen.

1:06:35.287 --> 1:06:36.497
All right, that was Alissa.

1:06:36.538 --> 1:06:37.372
- She called me-
- Also, you don't have

1:06:37.414 --> 1:06:39.208
a huge problem with
your manager calling you

1:06:39.249 --> 1:06:40.584
at three o'clock in the morning?

1:06:40.626 --> 1:06:42.044
That's when she does her reading, Alex.

1:06:42.086 --> 1:06:45.172
Anyways, she took some of
the footage over to Netflix,

1:06:45.214 --> 1:06:48.634
and they are putting together
an offer to buy the film.

1:06:48.675 --> 1:06:49.551
- What?
- Right now?

1:06:49.593 --> 1:06:51.261
- Yeah.
- How much?

1:06:51.303 --> 1:06:52.429
- Did they say how much?
- Are you for real?

1:06:52.471 --> 1:06:53.597
Do you think you can do reshoots?

1:06:53.639 --> 1:06:55.057
No, no, we don't need reshoots.

1:06:55.099 --> 1:06:56.392
They love the footage how it is.

1:06:56.433 --> 1:06:58.227
It's raw and tense and gritty.

1:06:58.268 --> 1:07:00.479
They're saying 2021 is
all about found footage.

1:07:01.814 --> 1:07:03.482
- But when do they want it?
- How is this gonna work?

1:07:03.524 --> 1:07:05.192
Do we get a percentage?

1:07:05.234 --> 1:07:06.568
Well, we need to finish the story.

1:07:06.610 --> 1:07:08.237
No, no, fuck the story.

1:07:08.278 --> 1:07:09.738
The story doesn't really, even
really matter at this point.

1:07:09.780 --> 1:07:11.156
They just love the energy of it.

1:07:11.198 --> 1:07:12.157
All right, but now we need to

1:07:12.199 --> 1:07:13.867
- figure out the why now factor.
- You guys, did you see that?

1:07:13.909 --> 1:07:14.701
What does that even mean?

1:07:17.162 --> 1:07:17.996
Whoa.

1:07:18.038 --> 1:07:18.831
Declan.

1:07:18.872 --> 1:07:19.665
Explain that Kip.

1:07:19.706 --> 1:07:22.126
He's obviously making
it about himself right now

1:07:22.167 --> 1:07:26.171
because this is a victory for
my writing, quite frankly.

1:07:26.213 --> 1:07:27.881
Guys, something's

1:07:27.923 --> 1:07:29.049
- in my apartment.
- Declan, what are you doing?

1:07:29.091 --> 1:07:31.135
Declan, where is the pendulum?

1:07:31.176 --> 1:07:32.052
- Declan?
- You guys.

1:07:32.094 --> 1:07:33.053
- Is he fucking around?
- Declan,

1:07:33.095 --> 1:07:36.515
where is the pendulum, you dipshit?

1:07:36.557 --> 1:07:37.516
Why are you wearing it?

1:07:37.558 --> 1:07:38.434
I told you it was a necklace.

1:07:38.475 --> 1:07:39.435
I told you it was a necklace.

1:07:39.476 --> 1:07:40.310
You just told me to take it.

1:07:40.352 --> 1:07:41.395
You didn't tell me what to do with it.

1:07:41.437 --> 1:07:42.730
Wait, do we really think that

1:07:42.771 --> 1:07:44.648
this stupid fucking necklace thing

1:07:44.690 --> 1:07:46.233
is controlling all of this?

1:07:46.275 --> 1:07:47.151
It has to be.

1:07:47.192 --> 1:07:47.985
I don't know-

1:07:48.861 --> 1:07:49.653
- Kelly.
- Guys, guys, Kelly.

1:07:49.695 --> 1:07:50.779
Kelly, Kelly.

1:07:50.821 --> 1:07:51.655
I'm okay.

1:07:51.697 --> 1:07:52.489
I'm okay.

1:07:53.365 --> 1:07:54.158
What the fuck is going on?

1:07:54.199 --> 1:07:54.992
What the fuck is going on?

1:07:55.033 --> 1:07:55.826
Oh my god.

1:07:57.536 --> 1:07:58.412
Oh my god.

1:07:58.454 --> 1:07:59.496
Kelly, are you okay?

1:07:59.538 --> 1:08:00.622
Yeah, it didn't end with Chrissy.

1:08:00.664 --> 1:08:02.040
It started with her.

1:08:02.082 --> 1:08:04.460
I could have just died.

1:08:04.501 --> 1:08:06.712
I might've actually just
died for a minute there.

1:08:06.754 --> 1:08:09.048
Well, you didn't, 'cause
you're breathing, but.

1:08:09.089 --> 1:08:11.675
I can't die as an
unemployed television actress.

1:08:11.717 --> 1:08:15.554
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
Kelly, just take a breath.

1:08:15.596 --> 1:08:16.680
Just breathe.

1:08:16.721 --> 1:08:19.600
Do it with me.

1:08:20.768 --> 1:08:22.310
Oh my god.

1:08:22.352 --> 1:08:23.479
What is happening?

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:25.564
Are you guys all in on this together?

1:08:25.606 --> 1:08:26.607
Fuck off, Kip.

1:08:26.648 --> 1:08:27.566
- No.
- No.

1:08:27.608 --> 1:08:30.444
- Fuck you, Kip.
- Okay, okay, shit.

1:08:30.486 --> 1:08:31.319
Jesus.

1:08:33.447 --> 1:08:34.698
Okay, so why?

1:08:38.368 --> 1:08:39.453
Why now?

1:08:39.495 --> 1:08:42.872
Because we started meddling
with this magic shit.

1:08:42.915 --> 1:08:45.042
The why now factor.

1:08:45.084 --> 1:08:46.710
Guys, the text.

1:08:46.752 --> 1:08:49.212
The answers are in the fucking text.

1:08:49.254 --> 1:08:50.631
Not now, Brando.

1:08:50.671 --> 1:08:51.465
Listen to me.

1:08:51.506 --> 1:08:52.674
Scene two, guys.

1:08:52.716 --> 1:08:55.469
All right, we called upon a
spirit during the FaceTime

1:08:55.511 --> 1:08:57.720
while Chrissy was swinging the pendulum.

1:08:57.763 --> 1:08:59.014
He's right.

1:08:59.055 --> 1:09:00.849
- And I said it was a conduit.
- Thank you.

1:09:00.890 --> 1:09:04.103
We said I call upon the darkness

1:09:04.144 --> 1:09:06.939
for only you can halt the attack.

1:09:06.979 --> 1:09:07.773
The pendulum is the condiment.

1:09:07.814 --> 1:09:10.401
We must have literally
called upon the darkness.

1:09:10.442 --> 1:09:11.777
Wait, Declan, you're the
one that sent it to us.

1:09:11.819 --> 1:09:13.569
Where'd you find it?

1:09:13.612 --> 1:09:14.738
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1:09:14.779 --> 1:09:15.948
On Reddit somewhere.

1:09:15.988 --> 1:09:17.073
Okay, find it again.

1:09:17.116 --> 1:09:18.742
Fuck.

1:09:18.783 --> 1:09:20.577
Pull it up, pull it up, pull it up.

1:09:20.618 --> 1:09:21.453
Declan.

1:09:22.621 --> 1:09:23.455
Declan.

1:09:24.415 --> 1:09:25.249
Declan.

1:09:25.290 --> 1:09:26.082
Here, here, here, here.

1:09:26.125 --> 1:09:27.626
I call upon the darkness,

1:09:27.667 --> 1:09:29.127
from my home to yours
I consent to your power

1:09:29.169 --> 1:09:31.087
for all the days and all the hours.

1:09:31.130 --> 1:09:32.673
All the days and all the...

1:09:32.715 --> 1:09:34.383
That sounds pretty permanent, guys.

1:09:34.425 --> 1:09:35.426
That's like forever.

1:09:35.466 --> 1:09:37.761
Does it say anything else?

1:09:37.803 --> 1:09:38.595
Scroll to the bottom.

1:09:38.636 --> 1:09:40.013
Do people say anything in the reviews?

1:09:40.055 --> 1:09:41.432
You don't review a Reddit.

1:09:42.975 --> 1:09:43.975
- Alex.
- Alex.

1:09:44.017 --> 1:09:44.810
Alex.

1:09:44.852 --> 1:09:45.935
Are you okay?

1:09:45.978 --> 1:09:46.812
In the comments.

1:09:46.854 --> 1:09:47.645
Check in the comments.

1:09:47.688 --> 1:09:49.273
Does it say anything?

1:09:49.314 --> 1:09:51.108
Nothing, just ton of you
got rid of my cheating ex,

1:09:51.149 --> 1:09:52.776
praise be, bullshit.

1:09:52.818 --> 1:09:54.194
Oh wait, wait, wait, here, here, here.

1:09:54.236 --> 1:09:55.988
I'm next, I'm next, fuck.

1:09:56.029 --> 1:09:58.407
Fuck, hurry up Declan, shit.

1:09:58.449 --> 1:10:00.117
How do you undo the curse?

1:10:00.159 --> 1:10:01.326
The original.

1:10:01.368 --> 1:10:03.704
open a
flood gate, how do you?

1:10:03.746 --> 1:10:05.205
How do you stop something
that's unstopabble?

1:10:05.247 --> 1:10:06.081
Isn't that what Chrissy said?

1:10:06.123 --> 1:10:07.708
Get to the point, get to
the point, get to the point.

1:10:07.750 --> 1:10:08.709
No, wait.

1:10:08.751 --> 1:10:10.461
It must, it must run its course.

1:10:10.502 --> 1:10:11.628
It must run its course.

1:10:11.670 --> 1:10:12.838
That sounds like it's from "The Craft."

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:14.590
That's directly from "The Craft."

1:10:14.631 --> 1:10:16.091
Well what's the course?

1:10:16.133 --> 1:10:17.301
What does it mean?

1:10:17.342 --> 1:10:18.886
The author has no imagination.

1:10:18.927 --> 1:10:21.263
No, it has to run its course.

1:10:21.305 --> 1:10:24.141
It must fulfill its objective.

1:10:24.183 --> 1:10:26.185
What's the objective?

1:10:26.226 --> 1:10:27.061
Wait,

1:10:28.812 --> 1:10:30.981
so we all have to,

1:10:31.023 --> 1:10:32.441
do we all have to die?

1:10:32.483 --> 1:10:34.234
- No, no, no, I don't think-
- please don't say-

1:10:35.194 --> 1:10:36.278
- Guys, we said,
- What's its objective

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:38.072
if not to kill us then?
I call upon the forces,

1:10:38.113 --> 1:10:39.448
I call upon the forces,

1:10:39.490 --> 1:10:41.992
to take them away, to take them back.

1:10:42.034 --> 1:10:43.035
To where?

1:10:44.578 --> 1:10:46.622
I mean, I guess the
spirit must be attacking

1:10:46.663 --> 1:10:48.207
what is evil inside of us?

1:10:48.248 --> 1:10:50.376
Like my original script, hold on.

1:10:50.417 --> 1:10:52.503
So we have to get rid of the evil

1:10:52.544 --> 1:10:54.380
that is inside all of us?

1:10:54.421 --> 1:10:55.339
How do we do that?

1:10:55.381 --> 1:10:57.674
Or pass it onto somebody more evil?

1:10:57.716 --> 1:11:01.470
Wait, you're talking
about killing someone.

1:11:02.596 --> 1:11:04.932
You don't even believe
in this shit, remember?

1:11:04.973 --> 1:11:06.058
Okay, no one's gonna die.

1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:07.267
No, one's gonna die.

1:11:07.309 --> 1:11:08.102
- No, one's gonna die.
- It's a little

1:11:08.143 --> 1:11:10.687
suspect now, okay?

1:11:10.729 --> 1:11:11.480
Max.

1:11:11.522 --> 1:11:12.314
- What the?
- Declan,

1:11:12.356 --> 1:11:13.148
you have to get rid of it.

1:11:13.190 --> 1:11:13.982
Yeah.

1:11:14.024 --> 1:11:14.817
Max.

1:11:14.858 --> 1:11:16.693
Declan, I do not care
who you send it to,

1:11:16.735 --> 1:11:17.903
just make sure that they've read

1:11:17.945 --> 1:11:19.613
the entire passage out loud.

1:11:19.655 --> 1:11:20.989
- It's the only way-
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

1:11:21.031 --> 1:11:21.824
that we can break the curse.
I'm on it.

1:11:21.865 --> 1:11:23.367
I'm on it.

1:11:23.409 --> 1:11:26.370
Fuck, dude I spilled my milk.

1:11:26.412 --> 1:11:28.539
I spilled my milk all
over the fuckin' floor.

1:11:28.580 --> 1:11:31.166
It's just, it's on my socks.

1:11:32.042 --> 1:11:34.753
Oh shit, oh my god, oh fuck.

1:11:34.795 --> 1:11:35.587
It's everywhere.

1:11:37.047 --> 1:11:38.382
- Oh, god.
- Not okay.

1:11:38.424 --> 1:11:39.341
Not okay, not okay,

1:11:39.383 --> 1:11:40.175
- not okay, not okay.
- I'll put on

1:11:40.217 --> 1:11:41.176
a new pair of socks.

1:11:41.218 --> 1:11:43.178
Declan, throw
away the fucking necklace.

1:11:51.395 --> 1:11:52.271
Hey.

1:11:52.312 --> 1:11:55.399
Oh shit, dude, you don't look so good.

1:11:55.441 --> 1:11:57.693
Oh well, I've seen worse.

1:11:58.736 --> 1:12:00.487
Well, hey did you get rid of it?

1:12:00.529 --> 1:12:02.281
Yeah, I'm on my way.

1:12:02.322 --> 1:12:03.657
Who, Declan?

1:12:03.699 --> 1:12:04.700
Who are you sending it to?

1:12:04.742 --> 1:12:05.534
Seriously?

1:12:05.576 --> 1:12:06.994
I know, I know, I know, but,

1:12:07.035 --> 1:12:08.954
I just, I need to know.

1:12:08.996 --> 1:12:10.414
Dude, is this why you're calling me?

1:12:10.456 --> 1:12:12.499
'Cause I'm trying to save our lives, okay?

1:12:12.541 --> 1:12:15.961
No, no, they found Chrissy's body, man.

1:12:17.546 --> 1:12:19.882
It's all over the news.

1:12:19.923 --> 1:12:20.758
Fuck.

1:12:21.675 --> 1:12:22.509
Fuck.

1:12:23.844 --> 1:12:25.179
I told you guys.

1:12:26.263 --> 1:12:27.931
I swear to God, I believed you.

1:12:27.973 --> 1:12:29.099
It's just-

1:12:29.141 --> 1:12:29.933
- What are they saying about it?

1:12:29.975 --> 1:12:32.352
It still doesn't make any sense, okay?

1:12:32.394 --> 1:12:35.147
They're calling it an accident.

1:12:35.189 --> 1:12:37.149
That is fuckin' bullshit, isn't it?

1:12:39.735 --> 1:12:42.780
Declan, do you think if
I woulda listened to Kelly,

1:12:42.821 --> 1:12:45.574
do you think Chrissy would still be alive?

1:12:45.616 --> 1:12:47.076
No I don't.

1:12:47.117 --> 1:12:47.910
And honestly, man,

1:12:47.951 --> 1:12:49.912
there's no use going down that road, okay?

1:12:49.953 --> 1:12:51.997
Look, this is almost behind us.

1:12:52.039 --> 1:12:52.831
I even wrote out instructions

1:12:52.873 --> 1:12:55.209
to read the fucking thing out loud, okay?

1:12:55.250 --> 1:12:57.002
But why, why would anyone do that?

1:12:57.044 --> 1:12:57.836
Why wouldn't they?

1:12:57.878 --> 1:12:58.670
We did.

1:12:58.712 --> 1:12:59.505
Look, I gotta go.

1:12:59.546 --> 1:13:00.631
Wait, Declan, Declan.

1:13:00.672 --> 1:13:01.632
Do you think this is gonna work?

1:13:04.259 --> 1:13:06.804
Honestly, Kip, I don't fuckin' know,

1:13:06.845 --> 1:13:07.930
but we're about to find out.

1:13:11.809 --> 1:13:14.186
Did you get this
email from the network?

1:13:14.228 --> 1:13:17.606
Yeah, it looks like we're all on it.

1:13:17.648 --> 1:13:20.609
Dude it's from Bobbie Brower.

1:13:20.651 --> 1:13:21.944
Wonderful.

1:13:21.985 --> 1:13:23.153
Now on top of everything else,

1:13:23.195 --> 1:13:25.781
our show's officially getting canceled.

1:13:25.823 --> 1:13:26.698
Dammit.

1:13:26.740 --> 1:13:27.574
Fuck.

1:13:28.826 --> 1:13:29.743
Hey, Max.

1:13:32.704 --> 1:13:33.497
Are you okay?

1:13:33.539 --> 1:13:34.706
You kinda look like shit, dude.

1:13:34.748 --> 1:13:37.376
No, no, no, I'm not okay, Alex.

1:13:37.418 --> 1:13:38.836
Frankly, it's kinda disconcerting to me

1:13:38.877 --> 1:13:40.337
that you guys are so calm, okay?

1:13:40.379 --> 1:13:42.506
- And I'm having panic attacks-
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, Max,

1:13:42.548 --> 1:13:43.757
- Max, Max, Max.
- Every two seconds.

1:13:43.799 --> 1:13:44.591
Hyperventilating likes it's my job.

1:13:44.633 --> 1:13:45.426
Okay.

1:13:45.467 --> 1:13:47.428
Let's not jump into anything.

1:13:47.469 --> 1:13:49.346
We don't know what this
meeting is about yet.

1:13:49.388 --> 1:13:51.223
What meeting, Kip?

1:13:51.265 --> 1:13:52.474
- What meeting?
- Bobbie Brower wants to talk

1:13:52.516 --> 1:13:53.976
to all of us on Friday.

1:13:54.017 --> 1:13:54.810
Bobbie?

1:13:54.852 --> 1:13:55.644
Yeah.

1:13:55.686 --> 1:13:56.478
Okay, maybe we should all go together,

1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:57.312
because I don't really think

1:13:57.354 --> 1:13:58.981
I should be going anywhere
alone at the moment

1:13:59.022 --> 1:14:00.357
or just being alone in general.

1:14:00.399 --> 1:14:02.276
Dude, it's summer hours.

1:14:02.317 --> 1:14:03.485
Meetings aren't in prison.

1:14:03.527 --> 1:14:05.779
Guys, screw, no, it's great, it's fine.

1:14:05.821 --> 1:14:06.739
Where the hell are you?

1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:09.575
I'm at my mom's house
because I got my ass beat

1:14:09.616 --> 1:14:11.535
by a ghost in my bedroom.

1:14:12.411 --> 1:14:15.873
God mom, you can't just
sneak up like that.

1:14:15.914 --> 1:14:18.125
I'm on the phone.

1:14:18.167 --> 1:14:19.668
Oh, sorry.

1:14:21.879 --> 1:14:23.047
- Okay, Max.
- Did Declan

1:14:23.088 --> 1:14:24.548
get rid of it yet?

1:14:24.590 --> 1:14:26.550
Because I'm really starting
to lose my shit, man.

1:14:26.592 --> 1:14:28.719
And I don't really think
I can do this anymore.

1:14:28.761 --> 1:14:29.553
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:14:29.595 --> 1:14:31.346
He sent it a couple days ago.

1:14:31.388 --> 1:14:32.431
Okay, okay.

1:14:34.391 --> 1:14:37.519
Then why do I still feel
like I'm being watched?

1:14:37.561 --> 1:14:38.979
I don't know, I don't know.

1:14:39.021 --> 1:14:40.939
Okay, I haven't felt right either.

1:14:40.981 --> 1:14:43.484
Ever since he sent it, I,

1:14:43.525 --> 1:14:45.319
I should have stopped him from sending it.

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:49.615
Yeah, but come on, what
other choice did we have?

1:14:52.159 --> 1:14:53.160
Yeah, I mean maybe this thing

1:14:53.202 --> 1:14:55.704
really does go after people who sin.

1:16:25.878 --> 1:16:27.755
- Hey.
- What up man?

1:16:27.796 --> 1:16:29.131
Hey guys.

1:16:29.173 --> 1:16:30.591
Hey guys.

1:16:30.632 --> 1:16:32.217
It's so good to see you all.

1:16:32.259 --> 1:16:33.177
Yeah.

1:16:33.218 --> 1:16:34.636
I'm glad you guys are okay.

1:16:34.678 --> 1:16:38.057
Listen, I just wanted to check in

1:16:38.098 --> 1:16:40.350
with everybody before we have
this meeting with the network.

1:16:40.392 --> 1:16:41.769
Who cancels the show of a dead girl?

1:16:41.810 --> 1:16:44.897
I mean it's so short sighted.

1:16:44.938 --> 1:16:46.690
Well, we don't know
if they're canceling us.

1:16:46.732 --> 1:16:48.650
I'm sorry, let's just take a moment

1:16:48.692 --> 1:16:51.361
for Chrissy's grieving
best friend, everyone.

1:16:51.403 --> 1:16:52.488
Don't be jealous.

1:16:52.529 --> 1:16:53.655
Jealous?

1:16:53.697 --> 1:16:55.074
Yeah, that's the word.

1:16:55.115 --> 1:16:58.077
Because I would love to be Chrissy's,

1:16:58.118 --> 1:17:00.245
what's that basic ass
hashtag she keeps using

1:17:00.287 --> 1:17:01.371
- in all the photos?
- Soul sister.

1:17:01.413 --> 1:17:03.332
Soul sister, yes, yes.

1:17:03.373 --> 1:17:06.502
How does it feel with
half your soul missing

1:17:06.543 --> 1:17:07.336
right now, Kelly?

1:17:07.378 --> 1:17:08.170
You know what?

1:17:08.212 --> 1:17:10.214
We played sisters and the
people wanna hear from me.

1:17:10.255 --> 1:17:12.508
Okay, has anyone heard from Declan?

1:17:12.549 --> 1:17:13.592
I haven't spoken to
him since he was gonna-

1:17:13.634 --> 1:17:15.636
- No.
- Mail the thing.

1:17:15.677 --> 1:17:16.970
No.

1:17:17.012 --> 1:17:17.805
- Yeah.
- Wait,

1:17:17.846 --> 1:17:18.847
he didn't respond to the email.

1:17:18.889 --> 1:17:22.601
No he didn't, but it's Declan so.

1:17:22.643 --> 1:17:24.812
I'm gonna call him.

1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:30.234
So

1:17:31.985 --> 1:17:33.987
any of you know what this meeting's about?

1:17:34.029 --> 1:17:34.822
No idea.

1:17:34.863 --> 1:17:35.906
Come on, it's obvious.

1:17:35.948 --> 1:17:37.866
When was the last time we
had a call with network?

1:17:37.908 --> 1:17:38.700
When we got hired.

1:17:38.742 --> 1:17:41.078
And when Declan got arrested

1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:42.579
for hitting that Uber driver in Miami.

1:17:42.621 --> 1:17:44.748
Exactly, they don't just call to say hi.

1:17:44.790 --> 1:17:46.792
Okay, he's not picking up.

1:17:46.834 --> 1:17:50.921
Hey listen, guys, if it is a cancellation,

1:17:50.963 --> 1:17:52.965
let's just play it cool.

1:17:53.006 --> 1:17:54.133
Okay?

1:17:54.174 --> 1:17:57.177
I mean, realistically
they'll probably just

1:17:57.219 --> 1:17:59.304
offer us therapy or something.

1:17:59.346 --> 1:18:00.723
I don't need their shitty therapist.

1:18:00.764 --> 1:18:02.266
I have my own.

1:18:02.307 --> 1:18:03.434
Of course you do.

1:18:04.768 --> 1:18:06.270
Okay, let's just not give 'em a reason

1:18:06.311 --> 1:18:08.439
to keep us under contract out of spite.

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:09.314
Okay?

1:18:09.356 --> 1:18:11.900
Otherwise we'll never be
able to finish our movie.

1:18:11.942 --> 1:18:12.735
What?

1:18:12.776 --> 1:18:14.445
You guys wanna finish the movie?

1:18:14.486 --> 1:18:15.571
Chrissy's dead.

1:18:15.612 --> 1:18:16.989
Kip, it's her best work.

1:18:17.030 --> 1:18:18.741
Oh my god.

1:18:18.782 --> 1:18:22.870
Yeah, I mean, I do think that
she'd want us to finish it.

1:18:22.911 --> 1:18:23.704
- Jesus.
- She might

1:18:23.746 --> 1:18:24.538
even get nominated.

1:18:24.580 --> 1:18:26.498
You are the worst person I have ever-

1:18:26.540 --> 1:18:28.167
- Are you on your period or something?

1:18:28.208 --> 1:18:29.293
I don't know what's going on.

1:18:29.334 --> 1:18:30.127
- Fuck off, Kelly.
- Okay, wait, shit,

1:18:30.169 --> 1:18:31.253
guys, it's time for the meeting.

1:18:31.295 --> 1:18:32.629
Okay?

1:18:32.671 --> 1:18:33.505
You ready?

1:18:34.715 --> 1:18:36.175
Yeah.

1:18:36.216 --> 1:18:37.551
Yeah.

1:18:37.593 --> 1:18:39.261
Blah, blah, blah.

1:18:39.303 --> 1:18:40.095
Yeah.

1:18:42.806 --> 1:18:44.683
Hey guys, good afternoon.

1:18:44.725 --> 1:18:45.809
Thank you for coming.

1:18:45.851 --> 1:18:47.603
We've got Bobbie Brower on the line.

1:18:47.644 --> 1:18:48.979
Welcome, everybody, welcome.

1:18:49.021 --> 1:18:49.813
Thank you for having us.

1:18:49.855 --> 1:18:53.442
Yeah, especially now
considering everything, so tragic.

1:18:53.484 --> 1:18:55.402
Although the show's never been so popular.

1:18:55.444 --> 1:18:57.488
Yeah, oh yeah it is.

1:18:57.529 --> 1:18:59.156
It's super tragic.

1:18:59.198 --> 1:19:01.158
Guys, you know Michelle,
from marketing, right?

1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:01.992
Okay, good.

1:19:02.034 --> 1:19:04.870
Hey, isn't there supposed
to be one more of you?

1:19:04.912 --> 1:19:06.038
Yes.

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:08.999
Wait, what is, what's this?

1:19:09.041 --> 1:19:10.501
This is going immediately, right?

1:19:10.542 --> 1:19:11.668
Like as soon as we hang up?

1:19:11.710 --> 1:19:12.544
Get it off.

1:19:12.586 --> 1:19:15.214
I don't even understand
your face right now.

1:19:15.255 --> 1:19:18.675
Yeah, where, is, was it, Declan, is it?

1:19:21.470 --> 1:19:23.972
Declan is,

1:19:24.014 --> 1:19:24.848
making a video.

1:19:26.058 --> 1:19:26.892
Yeah.

1:19:28.018 --> 1:19:31.313
From all of us to commemorate Chrissy.

1:19:31.355 --> 1:19:35.025
It's a goodbye from her "Belle" family.

1:19:35.067 --> 1:19:36.360
"Belle" family.

1:19:36.402 --> 1:19:37.820
Hmmm.

1:19:37.861 --> 1:19:40.114
Yeah, well, that's actually
really good thinking.

1:19:40.155 --> 1:19:43.826
We were gonna send it over to
you guys when it was finished.

1:19:43.867 --> 1:19:45.911
Thought it would be great press.

1:19:45.953 --> 1:19:49.748
I mean, look guys, I know
that you guys were all,

1:19:49.790 --> 1:19:53.544
I mean from your social media, very close,

1:19:53.585 --> 1:19:58.340
and I'm sure this has gotta
be really hard on all of you.

1:20:01.343 --> 1:20:02.928
God, I'm just, I'm not
really good at that stuff.

1:20:02.970 --> 1:20:03.762
You know what I mean?

1:20:03.804 --> 1:20:04.638
- Can we just-
- Bobbie, no, no, no,

1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:05.472
you're you're wonderful.

1:20:05.514 --> 1:20:06.306
You're great.

1:20:06.348 --> 1:20:08.559
You know, I think that
we should just push on

1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:09.518
because I know that you know

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:11.395
how valuable everyone's time is

1:20:11.437 --> 1:20:15.023
and you wanted to give the cast some news.

1:20:15.065 --> 1:20:16.233
Yeah, I did.

1:20:17.234 --> 1:20:22.197
Guys, I wanted to let
you know that "Belle"

1:20:23.282 --> 1:20:24.867
is being renewed

1:20:25.868 --> 1:20:27.035
for three more seasons.

1:20:28.579 --> 1:20:29.663
- Congratulations, guys.
- What?

1:20:29.705 --> 1:20:30.497
Oh my god, what?

1:20:30.539 --> 1:20:31.331
Oh my god.

1:20:31.373 --> 1:20:32.750
That's great, that's great news.

1:20:32.791 --> 1:20:34.835
This is so epic, thank you, thank you.

1:20:34.877 --> 1:20:37.880
It is, it is indeed epic.

1:20:37.921 --> 1:20:38.756
And you did that.

1:20:38.797 --> 1:20:40.507
I know, I did that.

1:20:40.549 --> 1:20:42.926
Oh my god, what a relief.

1:20:42.968 --> 1:20:45.345
You know, we just,
we have an opportunity

1:20:45.387 --> 1:20:48.140
here to really seize a moment.

1:20:48.182 --> 1:20:48.974
We should seize the moment.

1:20:49.016 --> 1:20:50.059
- Yes.
- This is the show.

1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:50.934
It's,

1:20:52.102 --> 1:20:53.854
it's a survivor, isn't it?

1:20:53.896 --> 1:20:55.522
And I honestly just think it would be,

1:20:55.564 --> 1:20:59.318
it would be a mistake
not to capitalize on...

1:21:02.571 --> 1:21:04.782
Guys, I need to take this call, okay?

1:21:04.823 --> 1:21:08.035
Harry, how do I mute this thing?

1:21:08.077 --> 1:21:09.745
Just turn the volume down.

1:21:09.787 --> 1:21:10.913
Yeah, it's on the side.

1:21:10.954 --> 1:21:11.830
The button with the bracket.

1:21:11.872 --> 1:21:14.708
Just press that, yeah, go down.

1:21:14.750 --> 1:21:15.959
Keep pressing.

1:21:16.001 --> 1:21:17.002
Okay, all right.

1:21:19.838 --> 1:21:20.672
Brower.

1:21:22.049 --> 1:21:23.467
- No.
- Um, um,

1:21:23.509 --> 1:21:24.468
- No, no, not at all.
- Wait, wait.

1:21:24.510 --> 1:21:28.055
- I think you forgot to-
- No, I said no.

1:21:28.097 --> 1:21:29.640
I don't understand how
you can't understand

1:21:29.681 --> 1:21:30.474
a word with two letters.

1:21:30.516 --> 1:21:33.227
It's no, he's a fucking prick,

1:21:33.268 --> 1:21:35.437
and I will not tolerate this shit anymore.

1:21:35.479 --> 1:21:38.107
- Oh, it's Bobbie with an I-E.
- Melanie, what is this?

1:21:38.148 --> 1:21:39.483
Is that the?

1:21:39.525 --> 1:21:40.818
- No, listen.
- Wait a minute.

1:21:40.859 --> 1:21:41.735
- Guys.
- I don't give a fuck.

1:21:41.777 --> 1:21:43.612
I'll put $10 million of my
own money into this thing

1:21:43.654 --> 1:21:45.364
to crush that fucking guy's spirit.

1:21:45.406 --> 1:21:46.198
Do you understand what

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:47.032
- I'm saying?
- No no no no no.

1:21:47.074 --> 1:21:47.866
- Oh no no no no no.
- I don't even care-

1:21:47.908 --> 1:21:50.119
- No, Bobbie.
- No, stop, no.

1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:52.538
- What is this crap?
- Stop, just throw it out.

1:21:52.579 --> 1:21:54.081
You're muted, she can't hear you.

1:21:54.123 --> 1:21:54.915
What?

1:21:54.957 --> 1:21:56.250
Oh, it's from that asshole, okay.

1:21:56.291 --> 1:21:57.084
She didn't mean that.

1:21:57.126 --> 1:21:57.918
You know what?

1:21:57.960 --> 1:21:58.752
This is already more than I've talked

1:21:58.794 --> 1:22:00.462
to anyone I've ever fucked,
male or female, okay?

1:22:00.504 --> 1:22:01.588
So I'm bored.

1:22:01.630 --> 1:22:02.423
I'm bored with you.

1:22:02.464 --> 1:22:03.590
I'm bored with this conversation.

1:22:03.632 --> 1:22:04.925
All right, just write something up

1:22:04.967 --> 1:22:05.801
that I can sign on Monday.

1:22:05.843 --> 1:22:06.927
And if I feel like it, I'll fucking do it.

1:22:06.969 --> 1:22:08.011
And if not, you can go yourself.

1:22:08.053 --> 1:22:09.888
Declan, what the fuck did you do?

1:22:09.930 --> 1:22:11.306
- You sent it to Bobbie?
- Really?

1:22:11.348 --> 1:22:12.141
No no no no no.

1:22:12.182 --> 1:22:13.392
Can you do that for me?

1:22:13.434 --> 1:22:14.643
I hope it ruins your fucking weekend.

1:22:14.685 --> 1:22:15.519
Goodbye.

1:22:16.854 --> 1:22:18.021
So inspiring.

1:22:18.063 --> 1:22:19.523
Harry, you can't let her read that.

1:22:19.565 --> 1:22:21.316
Please do not let her read that.

1:22:21.358 --> 1:22:22.484
Wait, you can hear us?

1:22:22.526 --> 1:22:23.318
Yeah.

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:24.820
All right, what the fuck is this?

1:22:24.862 --> 1:22:25.779
Oh no, please don't.

1:22:25.821 --> 1:22:29.283
I call upon the darkness for
only you can halt the attack.

1:22:29.324 --> 1:22:31.827
Oooo.

1:22:31.869 --> 1:22:34.955
I call upon your
forces to take them away.

1:22:34.997 --> 1:22:39.376
To take them back
evil from my home to yours

1:22:40.252 --> 1:22:43.213
- We're fucked.
- Days and hours.

1:22:43.255 --> 1:22:44.339
Why does every fucking actor

1:22:44.381 --> 1:22:45.591
think that they can write poetry?

1:22:45.632 --> 1:22:47.134
Oh my god.

1:22:47.176 --> 1:22:47.968
Where did he buy this?

1:22:48.010 --> 1:22:48.927
From like a crafting hobo?

1:22:48.969 --> 1:22:49.845
Oh this is...

1:22:49.887 --> 1:22:51.055
Did we just hear that again?

1:22:51.096 --> 1:22:52.222
Oh fuck, it's too late.

1:22:52.264 --> 1:22:54.224
If it wasn't after us before, it is now.

1:22:54.266 --> 1:22:56.101
Oh, we're screwed, we're screwed.

1:22:56.143 --> 1:22:59.855
All right, fine.

1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:03.567
Hey guys, sorry about that.

1:23:03.609 --> 1:23:04.485
I just had to take that call.

1:23:04.526 --> 1:23:07.071
So hey, there you are.

1:23:07.112 --> 1:23:09.156
Hi, I got your gift.

1:23:09.198 --> 1:23:12.993
So thoughtful and honestly too expensive.

1:23:13.035 --> 1:23:14.411
You really shouldn't have,
you shouldn't have done that.

1:23:14.453 --> 1:23:16.330
That was really too much.

1:23:23.003 --> 1:23:23.796
Ooo.

1:23:23.837 --> 1:23:24.922
Are you okay?

1:23:24.963 --> 1:23:26.340
Is this a viral thing?

1:23:58.288 --> 1:23:59.540
Jesus Christ.

1:24:01.500 --> 1:24:03.085
Fucking actors, man.

1:24:22.062 --> 1:24:23.188
Are you guys rolling?

1:24:23.230 --> 1:24:24.064
Is everybody rolling?

1:24:24.106 --> 1:24:25.858
Scene 12, shit.

1:24:25.899 --> 1:24:26.900
Take.

1:24:26.942 --> 1:24:29.903
Scene two, wait, scene two, take three.

1:24:29.945 --> 1:24:30.863
Three.

1:24:30.904 --> 1:24:32.656
Scene 22, take three,

1:24:32.698 --> 1:24:34.074
Declan, motherfucker.

1:24:36.869 --> 1:24:37.661
I was early.

1:24:37.703 --> 1:24:38.495
I just clapped.

1:24:38.537 --> 1:24:39.872
I did my thing and I clapped.

1:24:39.913 --> 1:24:40.914
We're fucked.

1:24:42.166 --> 1:24:44.376
Guys, this is gonna be really
great on the blooper reel.

1:24:45.919 --> 1:24:46.920
No.

1:24:46.962 --> 1:24:49.965
Oh shit, Kevin you're
gonna bloody kill me.

1:24:50.007 --> 1:24:51.133
It did fall out.

1:24:53.135 --> 1:24:53.969
Sorry, lost camera.

1:24:54.011 --> 1:24:55.554
Are we supposed to cut?

1:24:55.596 --> 1:24:56.847
Sorry.

1:24:56.889 --> 1:24:57.681
Fuck.

1:25:03.687 --> 1:25:04.480
I'm embarrassed.

1:25:04.521 --> 1:25:06.774
I'm actually embarrassed to
be touching this right now.

1:25:06.815 --> 1:25:08.108
Smells like urine.

1:25:08.150 --> 1:25:11.361
Holy god, look at that stache.

1:25:11.403 --> 1:25:13.697
No, no, I, this is, I
dug my own grave here,

1:25:13.739 --> 1:25:14.531
and I love it,

1:25:14.573 --> 1:25:16.825
but I'm ready to lick my
lip and have it be smooth.

1:25:16.867 --> 1:25:17.868
Oh my god, I can't.

1:25:23.832 --> 1:25:25.626
It's real, Kip, it's real.

1:25:25.667 --> 1:25:28.295
God, mom, you can't sneak up like that.

1:25:29.421 --> 1:25:30.589
I'm on the phone.

1:25:30.631 --> 1:25:33.425
You can't sneak up on me like that.

1:25:34.343 --> 1:25:36.053
Fucking, I'm sweating.

1:25:36.095 --> 1:25:37.554
I'm so hot right now.

1:25:41.016 --> 1:25:43.143
Mom, we're gettin' renewed, ha ha.

1:25:46.105 --> 1:25:46.939
Shit.

1:25:48.065 --> 1:25:50.484
It's like performance...

1:25:50.526 --> 1:25:51.318
Yeaaahhh.

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:53.570
That was fucking brilliant.

1:25:53.612 --> 1:25:55.948
Are you fucking serious?

1:25:55.989 --> 1:25:56.782
More vodka.

1:26:07.626 --> 1:26:11.714
That's great.

1:26:11.755 --> 1:26:13.882
Oh my god, guys, I wasn't rolling.

1:26:13.924 --> 1:26:14.800
I wasn't rolling.

1:26:16.927 --> 1:26:18.554
Yes, did you build that monologue?

1:26:18.595 --> 1:26:19.388
Did you build it?

1:26:19.430 --> 1:26:20.264
I'm gonna.

1:26:20.305 --> 1:26:22.141
No you did not build the monologue.

1:26:22.182 --> 1:26:24.601
Build the fucking monologue, Max.

1:26:24.643 --> 1:26:27.521
Are we gonna get an X rating
from all of our fuck yous?

1:26:27.563 --> 1:26:28.355
It's a lot of fucks.

1:26:39.616 --> 1:26:40.993
You guys, I don't really
know how to work this.

1:26:41.034 --> 1:26:42.536
How do I hang up?
