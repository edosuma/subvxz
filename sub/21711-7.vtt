00:32.742 --> 00:35.244
On the road from Galilee,

00:35.369 --> 00:41.834
Christ came upon a beggar
who had thrice been denied alms.

00:42.918 --> 00:49.592
Christ asked him if he'd taken before
that which wasn't his.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.719
"Yes," the man said.

00:51.844 --> 00:57.349
He'd taken what he felt
hadn't been given.

00:58.601 --> 01:01.937
Christ asked him...

01:04.315 --> 01:07.985
Christ asked him
where had it left him...

01:29.381 --> 01:31.217
Give him some.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.908
Boss, I think I know whose car this is.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.979
My name is Pacho Herrera.

02:26.438 --> 02:30.442
I want Gerda Salazar
and her fucking sons delivered to me.

02:30.568 --> 02:34.989
Until that happens,
nobody in the North Valley is safe.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.615
Is that clear?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.619
Make sure Orlando Henao
gets the message.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.748
And now... pray.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.127
Pray.

04:45.119 --> 04:48.539
'War had returned to Colombia.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.376
'Cocaine cartels are about succession.

04:53.127 --> 04:57.006
'The number two guys realise that
the number one guys are on their way out.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.967
'So they decide to speed things up.

05:01.427 --> 05:05.055
'With Gilberto Rodríguez in jail,
there was blood in the water.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.391
'And blood begets more blood.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.270
'I told you that Cali ran their empire
like a business.

05:11.395 --> 05:17.026
'Well, when your business gets too big,
you start selling franchises.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.905
'Cali basically allowed traffickers
who would normally be their rivals

05:22.031 --> 05:25.117
'to work under the umbrella
of their political protection,

05:25.242 --> 05:27.995
'to use their cocaine
distribution network

05:28.120 --> 05:31.540
'and to take advantage of their muscle
when shit got heavy.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.962
'In return, they demanded loyalty
and a hefty cut of the profits.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.214
'And for a long time that was cool.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.843
'But as brilliant
as Cali's surrender plan was,

05:42.968 --> 05:46.889
it didn't take into account that
nobody wants to retire in second place.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.893
'North Valley cartel
was ready for first place.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.562
'Traffickers like Iván Urdinola,

05:54.438 --> 05:57.900
'Henry Loaiza, Gerda Salazar,

05:58.442 --> 06:01.570
'and the North Valley boss,
Orlando Henao.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.906
'They didn't need to retire.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.575
'They controlled not only
the rural North Valley,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.535
'but the port of Buenaventura,

06:08.660 --> 06:10.662
'from which most of the world's
cocaine shipped.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.291
'It was the jewel in their crown.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.921
'And they did business...
differently than Cali.

06:27.179 --> 06:30.599
'Let's just say they didn't give a shit
about public relations.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.312
"'Fuck the Gentlemen of Cali,"
they figured.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.982
'With the port
and Cali's current legal troubles,

06:39.108 --> 06:40.943
'they had a shot at taking over.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.237
'It is often said in organised crime...'

06:43.362 --> 06:46.073
'...that war is bad for business.'

06:46.198 --> 06:47.866
Unless it's won.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.161
Buenaventura is in Henao's territory.

06:51.286 --> 06:55.290
We have to get the port back
so we can maintain our delivery schedules.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.419
You think that...

06:59.753 --> 07:01.630
Can it be done?

07:05.801 --> 07:09.388
Negotiating with the government,
and the fucking surrender...

07:11.765 --> 07:14.143
...it all means one thing.

07:15.978 --> 07:21.066
Our allies and enemies think we're weak.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.153
My brother Gilberto
is responsible for that.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.077
How's Alvaro?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.079
What do you want me to say, Miguel?

07:34.538 --> 07:37.708
The doctors still don't know
if his cock will ever work again.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.878
He's 22 years old.

07:42.921 --> 07:48.260
I swear to you, Pacho,
the Salazars will pay for that shit.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.138
You know where Miguel is.
Why haven't you arrested him?

07:51.263 --> 07:52.347
It's not that simple, Jorge.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.725
This kind of operation
needs to be vetted, approved.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.102
Wait a minute.
How many people know about this?

07:57.227 --> 07:59.188
Very few. And nobody knows your name.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.523
We're gonna arrest
Miguel Rodríguez, all right?

08:01.648 --> 08:03.317
And you can put all this behind you.

08:03.775 --> 08:07.154
- Can I ask what your plan is?
- Small team, just before dawn.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.156
- When?
- Zero- four- hundred. Tomorrow.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.700
Transpo's three trucks
coming from different directions...

08:11.825 --> 08:15.412
No, that's not gonna work. Miguel has
rotating security around the building.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.540
They see anything unusual,
a call goes out to Fercho Castillo.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.583
That's Miguel's assistant.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.710
They'll be out of the house
before you get through the lobby.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.004
So then help us find
a blind spot in the perimeter.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.924
There's no blind spots.
These people are professional.

08:27.049 --> 08:30.594
- What about if we hit at shift change?
- We overlap shifts because of that reason.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.764
Guys!

08:35.057 --> 08:36.517
That's it? That's the plan?

08:36.642 --> 08:38.519
Christ.

08:49.071 --> 08:53.242
Have your entire team take <i>Carrera Diez.</i>
Make a turn at <i>Avenida Siete.</i>

08:53.367 --> 08:56.703
I'll post a man there
that's gonna let you guys through.

08:57.246 --> 09:00.499
You're putting a lot of faith in this guy.
You sure we can count on him?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.293
I'll be the man posted there,
but if you don't get Miguel,

09:03.418 --> 09:05.254
they're gonna fucking kill me.
Do you understand that?

09:05.379 --> 09:08.131
- They're gonna kill my family, my kids.
- We're not gonna let that happen.

09:08.257 --> 09:12.010
Next time we see you, we're putting you
and your family on a plane to America.

09:13.512 --> 09:16.139
You're getting out. Just like we promised.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.226
Minister Botero,
with Miguel Rodríguez in charge,

09:19.351 --> 09:20.894
we're dealing
with a different kind of cartel.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.105
Then maybe you
shouldn't have arrested his brother.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.400
This operation could significantly impact
the cartel's day- to- day,

09:26.525 --> 09:27.484
stop the bloodshed.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.070
Based on information
you're unwilling to share.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.823
- Well, due to the sensitivity...
- Yes, you've said.

09:32.948 --> 09:36.660
But gentlemen, to ask me to sign off
on this operation blindly?

09:36.785 --> 09:39.538
You haven't given me anything
other than a code name.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.709
How much can you trust this informant...
"Natalia"?

09:46.128 --> 09:47.421
Or is that too much to ask?

09:47.546 --> 09:49.381
I understand your frustration.

09:49.881 --> 09:53.135
But I've been assured
that this intelligence is viable.

09:55.470 --> 09:59.349
If you won't tell me what you have,
then please, get to what you need.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.478
- A small team. No more than ten men.
- Contact General Vargas.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.190
- I'll authorise him to provide you one.
- Actually, sir,

10:07.316 --> 10:10.485
we were hoping you would provide
somebody independent of General Vargas.

10:11.737 --> 10:16.617
If you would
just indulge us this one request.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.289
Shall I assume you have someone in mind?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.542
General Serrano, sir.

10:33.508 --> 10:34.760
<i>Agente Peña...</i>

10:35.719 --> 10:39.348
...another setback and I won't be able
to help you, nor will I want to.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.268
The case for the surrender deal
will only be strengthened.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.270
And you and your team will be gone.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.775
I appreciate your honesty, sir.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.072
Thank you, Minister.

11:04.790 --> 11:08.293
'Through intimidation
and corruption,

11:08.418 --> 11:12.547
'the Cali Cartel had effectively taken much
of the Colombian National Police force

11:12.673 --> 11:14.508
'and bent them to its will.'

11:14.633 --> 11:15.884
MONASTERY OF EL CARMEN

11:16.009 --> 11:18.887
'But there was one force it couldn't bend:

11:19.012 --> 11:23.850
'a man named General José Serrano...

11:25.185 --> 11:29.147
'...whose faith and integrity
were exactly what we needed.'

11:29.272 --> 11:32.693
Agent Peña, nice to meet you.
Your reputation precedes you.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.032
'Serrano took two things seriously:

11:39.157 --> 11:41.284
'his service to God

11:41.410 --> 11:43.995
'and his belief in the rule of law.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.290
'He expected the same from his men.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.837
'For him, it began at an early age.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.382
'He was a <i>campesino,</i>
the son of a dirt farmer.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.926
'He had never owned a pair of shoes.

11:59.302 --> 12:03.849
'One day, a group of mounted policemen
rode into his village.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.769
'It reminded him of the holy knights
that he had read about,

12:07.894 --> 12:11.648
'religious warriors
on a mission from God.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.945
'He knew then...

12:19.448 --> 12:21.700
'...that he would be one of them.

12:26.288 --> 12:30.208
'He joined the force expecting
to find other like-minded men.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.544
'But instead, he found corruption.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.338
'From where he could, he rooted it out.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.049
'When he became chief
of his first small town,

12:38.175 --> 12:40.719
'he fired over two thirds of the department

ANTI-NARCOTIC POLICE

'...declaring war on corrupt cops

'I will put
in maximum effort, with all my soul,

12:49.561 --> 12:52.355
'into fighting corruption.

12:52.481 --> 12:55.901
'Because when there is corruption,

12:56.026 --> 12:59.237
'there is no procedure,
there is no peace of mind.'

13:00.197 --> 13:04.326
'Twenty years and numerous
failed assassination attempts later,

13:04.451 --> 13:08.705
'he was still waging his war,
by the book, of course.'

13:09.748 --> 13:13.627
This informant
of yours is close to Miguel Rodríguez?

13:13.752 --> 13:16.338
He's provided us with Miguel's location.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.216
That's why it's urgent we move now.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.927
It may take a miracle
to get this close again.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.095
Only God creates miracles.

13:24.221 --> 13:29.976
It's for us to use the tools he's bestowed
to resolve these matters.

13:31.186 --> 13:35.982
Any chance God's bestowed
the right men to pull off this operation?

13:36.107 --> 13:38.527
God has many soldiers.

13:38.652 --> 13:44.115
Mine are honest men who answer
to higher powers than you or I.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.786
I'm not concerned about them.
But I'm worried about other issues.

13:47.911 --> 13:51.081
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
has led to new stipulations.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.583
From now on, any warrant I sign

13:53.708 --> 13:57.295
has to be filed
with the local <i>fiscale</i> office in Cali.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.131
Which the cartel will know about.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.883
Possibly.

14:02.008 --> 14:06.429
Truth is, your tactics
won't be allowed a second run.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.932
Just have to find new ones, General.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.936
Your men, General,
where are they now?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.813
Awaiting their orders.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.649
The target is Miguel Rodríguez.

14:18.149 --> 14:23.655
Our operation will succeed
because you fulfil your duty to your God

14:24.447 --> 14:26.324
and to your country.
Understood?

14:26.449 --> 14:27.909
Yes, sir!

14:28.034 --> 14:31.162
The operation from a strategic
point of view is a nightmare.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.665
There's a security perimeter.

14:33.790 --> 14:38.128
As soon as the lead team hits the lobby,
the target knows we're inside.

14:38.253 --> 14:42.757
Agent Feistl and I will be
right behind you, arriving by helicopter.

14:42.883 --> 14:46.469
We'll land on the roof
and come in from above.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.055
- We're going to box them in.
- Yes.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.640
We have an inside man.

14:50.765 --> 14:54.769
He'll be posted right here,
giving us our best way in.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.446
Which one do you want?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.907
- This one!
- Okay. Perfect.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.742
Girls, please get ready.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.623
Paola... you can't do this.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.918
- I'm taking the girls to my parents'.
- Paola, you can't do this.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.628
Especially with what's going on
with the cartel.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.463
What? What are you saying?

15:22.297 --> 15:25.592
Are you telling me I can't protect
my daughters? Is that what you're saying?

15:25.717 --> 15:30.138
No. What I'm saying is that we need
to act normal, like everything is fine.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.516
Everything isn't fine, Jorge.
Everything isn't fine.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.560
They could be watching you, me, the girls.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.104
Miguel's become paranoid.
Do you understand?

15:40.732 --> 15:43.735
I'll call you in a few days.
The girls will want to hear from you.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.238
Paola. Please.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.785
The Americans are going to try
to arrest Miguel.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.704
I'm going to make sure they succeed.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.707
Tomorrow, we will be on a plane.
You, me, the girls.

15:57.832 --> 16:01.670
- We're leaving Colombia.
- Who told you I want to live in the U.S.?

16:02.545 --> 16:06.633
Who told you our girls want to leave
the only home they've ever known?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.635
So we need to disappear.
Is that your plan?

16:08.760 --> 16:11.513
Explain to me again
because I don't get it.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.682
What happens if the Americans fail?

16:19.688 --> 16:23.024
Paola, please. Please... wait.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.748
Don't leave.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.711
We weren't poor, Jorge.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.549
We always had choices.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.971
This was your choice.

17:04.524 --> 17:08.486
What about the warrant?
You still haven't filed the paperwork.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.197
And I can't authorise this raid
without it.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.991
We're bringing the <i>fiscale</i> with us.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.911
Until we're on-site,
no one else knows the real target.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.705
Arrest him quickly.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.207
Because if word of this gets out,

17:21.332 --> 17:23.626
they'll try to stop us
with everything they've got.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.671
General...

17:26.796 --> 17:29.799
General... one more thing.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.345
I'd like to ask you to remain in Bogotá.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.892
Those are my men.
That's my signature on the warrant.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.020
Which puts your name on the line, sir.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.439
If anything goes wrong,
and we look like...

17:44.564 --> 17:46.483
Like what? Like idiots?

17:47.317 --> 17:49.778
It wouldn't be the first time,
as I understand it.

17:51.488 --> 17:55.950
You don't trust me.
But you can't do this without me.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.871
That's true, but I know the system
we're up against.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.541
With your name on the warrant...

18:04.834 --> 18:07.045
...there's no doubt
the cartel's watching you.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.139
As soon as you make the arrest,

18:18.264 --> 18:23.311
I'll be the one to lead Miguel Rodríguez
into custody when the press arrive.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.272
I'll stay here praying for your success,

18:26.397 --> 18:29.776
because there's no doubt
it's your reputation now on the line.

19:11.901 --> 19:16.114
Hi, boss. What's going on?
Getting a little late for you, huh?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.366
Just checking in.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.035
You run those taps over in El Lido

19:21.161 --> 19:22.745
- like I asked?
- Yes, sir.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.873
- Perfect.
- All right. Well done.

19:29.294 --> 19:33.256
Enrique, why don't you take off
and I'll keep an eye out here tonight?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.675
Is this some kind of test?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.679
Someone offers me a day off,
I say yes.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.355
My wife's been hounding me.

19:50.315 --> 19:54.235
I could use a night away
from all of her questions, Enrique.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.405
I'm glad I'm not married yet.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.991
Don't make that mistake.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.204
Thank you, boss.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.130
It's Miguel.

20:14.255 --> 20:18.384
Don't worry, boss.
I'll hang out until you get back.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.764
Good.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.727
Miguel's just finishing his call.
Come on in.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.274
We can discuss that later.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.236
He's here now.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.116
Yes, you've said.

21:24.659 --> 21:25.868
Bye.

21:29.247 --> 21:35.169
My son. You know how he is.
A little... complicated.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.089
He is your son.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.733
- Is this the guy with the warrant?
- Yeah, I think so.

21:57.692 --> 21:58.943
Yeah.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.404
Looks friendly.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.365
I don't give a shit,
as long as he does what he's told.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.456
Good things
are coming, Jorge. You'll be part of it.

22:12.457 --> 22:15.251
I'm glad, sir.
Is there anything else?

22:16.627 --> 22:18.463
Take a seat.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.969
You know that my brother...

22:26.012 --> 22:28.514
he doesn't like this war thing.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.684
He thinks it's a mistake,
being at war with the North Valley.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.188
He said this brings too much tension,

22:35.313 --> 22:37.982
with the violence and everything.

22:38.566 --> 22:42.111
He's getting counsel
from men I don't trust at all.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.199
Those phones that you...

22:47.575 --> 22:49.494
How do you call it? Wiretaps?

22:51.954 --> 22:53.247
Wiretap.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.750
Do you think...

22:56.793 --> 23:00.421
...you could put one
on my brother's phone in prison?

23:07.553 --> 23:10.306
You want me to tap
Gilberto's phone in prison?

23:12.266 --> 23:13.768
Mm-hmm.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.688
For his own good.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.776
Only if it became necessary.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.237
So... for him.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.367
Of course, sir. Anything you need.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.743
Good.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.997
- This stays here.
- Of course, sir.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.631
Well, I should get back downstairs.
I'm posted outside tonight.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.968
You? Nonsense.
You're too old for that!

23:47.552 --> 23:49.637
I don't mind at all. It's part of my job.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.974
No. No way.
Have one of the young guys do it.

23:53.558 --> 23:57.019
You know, I'm eating late.
Fercho was about to make something.

23:57.145 --> 24:01.190
You'll join us.
You'll join us, Jorge.

24:01.315 --> 24:04.277
Fercho, we'll be two! Come.

24:40.897 --> 24:44.233
- Do you like filets, Jorge?
- Yes, very much.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.196
Hey, I've been meaning to tell you,

24:49.530 --> 24:54.118
the building guys, they've been idling
in front of the house.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.746
Blocking our exit.

24:56.871 --> 25:00.124
You see that? Feels good
when one's been taken care of.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.711
Yes. Keep your walkie charged.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.757
And the exits clear.
Like you said.

25:09.425 --> 25:12.803
- You want one?
- Yes, thanks.

25:18.142 --> 25:22.063
Look, I have a bottle
of white wine that is...

25:22.188 --> 25:25.733
Excuse me, boss, if it's not
too much trouble, I prefer red wine.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.237
Okay. It's a shame, but... okay.

25:29.946 --> 25:33.908
But I have a really nice bottle
of red wine. I'll bring it. I'll be back.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.173
'You're in for a treat tonight.'

25:49.298 --> 25:53.928
Miguel has me cooking
with these Japanese bread crumbs.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.390
Sounds crazy,
but it's actually more tasty.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.767
That's very interesting.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.979
Hey, Fercho, looks like the oil's ready.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.189
Yes.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.205
Boss! Boss! Boss!

26:21.330 --> 26:25.251
We have cars heading towards the building.
I repeat, boss, three trucks with cops...

26:51.402 --> 26:54.030
Gentlemen, by law, I can't let you in.
This is a residence...

26:54.155 --> 26:56.616
We have a warrant. Hey!

26:57.825 --> 27:00.161
- A residence?
- What?

27:09.462 --> 27:12.340
Did you hear that?

27:16.427 --> 27:18.346
Enrique! What the fuck is going on?

27:18.471 --> 27:20.181
How come you didn't inform us
there's a helicopter?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.808
- How the fuck did they find us?
- Sir, calm down.

27:22.933 --> 27:25.686
We need to get you out of here now.
There's no time to discuss this.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.980
- Miguel, what's happening?
- You need to hide.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.775
Is there somewhere we can take you?
A <i>caleta</i> in the apartment?

27:30.900 --> 27:34.445
Stop. Get to the lobby.
Get to the lobby and stop them.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.073
It's better if he goes.
Every second counts.

27:37.198 --> 27:38.866
Get to the lobby! Stop them!

27:38.991 --> 27:40.326
María!

28:11.357 --> 28:12.650
No, no, no, no, no.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.362
- Colombian law.
- No, but if he's got a <i>caleta...</i>

28:16.487 --> 28:19.990
If you want anything we do in there
to count, follow the fucking rules.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.495
Van Ness. Where are you?

28:24.620 --> 28:27.081
I need the <i>fiscale</i> upstairs.
Where the fuck are you?

28:27.206 --> 28:29.041
This isn't a financial building.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.210
Miguel Rodríguez is upstairs.
We have the warrant.

28:31.335 --> 28:34.839
- Yes. Without an address filed in Cali.
- So fill it in!

28:34.964 --> 28:38.884
As I've told you, my office authorised
the search of a financial corporation.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.512
- What the fuck is this?
- Hands in the air!

28:48.436 --> 28:51.647
Look, sir, as I told your agent,
I can't do...

28:51.772 --> 28:55.317
Write the address in right now.
That's why you're here.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.570
You decide how you want this to go.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.074
Okay.

29:08.956 --> 29:11.917
- Are you Fernando Castillo?
- What's all this?

29:13.461 --> 29:15.921
We're here to arrest Miguel Rodríguez.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.548
Miguel isn't here.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.107
- There's nothing.
- Look above.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.610
Take that off!

29:37.735 --> 29:40.571
Cabinets. There's nothing here.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.032
Try the ones below.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.255
Who's in charge here?

29:59.715 --> 30:01.133
I asked you a question.

30:01.258 --> 30:04.386
I'm sorry, sir. We're not authorised
to let anyone inside.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.932
You see this fucking badge?

30:10.309 --> 30:14.188
Your superiors failed to report
this operation with the local bureau.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.232
I'd like to know
who'll be answering for that.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.275
These are direct orders
from my superiors, sir.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.110
Step out of my way.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.867
Peinados, stay here.
Let's go!

30:26.992 --> 30:28.702
Move!

30:28.828 --> 30:31.997
Sergeant, you copy?
The local police are heading up.

30:37.211 --> 30:39.630
Go to the back, please.
You can sit on the couch.

30:41.090 --> 30:44.176
- How long is this going to take?
- Chris.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.767
What are you doing?

30:53.227 --> 30:56.480
Hey, kid. Where is he?
Was Miguel Rodríguez here?

30:56.605 --> 30:59.650
- Don't speak to my son.
- Okay.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.820
Can he please go to his room?
He's just a child.

31:02.945 --> 31:04.822
- Is the room clear?
- Clear.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.616
Okay, leave. Go ahead.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.871
Flores...

31:13.873 --> 31:16.208
- Who's in charge here?
- DEA.

31:18.002 --> 31:20.254
I assume with Colombian support.

31:21.171 --> 31:24.800
I don't see a ranking officer.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.344
Guess that puts me in charge.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.847
There's an exit over there
that leads to the street.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.933
Do you have anyone posted there?
Of course.

31:33.058 --> 31:36.020
If you'd properly notified my unit,
we could've blocked that exit

31:36.145 --> 31:38.731
- and prevented this escape.
- There's no evidence he got out.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.525
That's why you're looking
through the kitchen cabinets?

31:50.659 --> 31:53.203
David!

31:53.329 --> 31:54.622
David!

31:56.206 --> 31:58.751
Wake up, man! We have to go.

32:00.169 --> 32:03.464
Let go of her already.
Come on, man!

32:28.739 --> 32:32.076
I think it's time you call your friend
Natalia. Find out what she's heard.

32:32.201 --> 32:35.621
Erm...
Boss, that's Natalia on the couch.

32:40.042 --> 32:43.879
- Find out what the fuck is going on.
- Don't say a word, brother.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.715
We need to put them each
in separate rooms.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.717
Fercho. Let's go.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.974
To the right.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.569
This is messed up, man.

33:08.696 --> 33:12.241
- If your dad's still inside...
- Just drive the fucking car.

33:18.497 --> 33:22.334
I'm just trying to do my fucking job.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.753
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Gotta be hiding somewhere.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.588
- Gotta be a <i>caleta.</i>
- Where?

33:26.714 --> 33:28.799
- I don't know.
- Help us. We're running out of time.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.593
I've never been here before.
I don't know the floor plan.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.054
I don't know anything. This is new.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.389
Wait.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.730
Get back out there.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.357
Fuck... Okay. Come on.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.943
Wait. I need you to hit me first.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.998
'We know that agents of the DEA
burst into the building this morning,

34:01.123 --> 34:03.000
'just before dawn...'

34:03.542 --> 34:06.128
Hey, what did Salcedo say?

34:07.588 --> 34:09.089
Salcedo! What did he say?

34:09.214 --> 34:12.342
Sir, the thing is...
no one's heard from him.

34:12.468 --> 34:14.261
Motherfucker!

34:16.138 --> 34:17.973
Do me a favour.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.934
Go to his house and
check what the fuck he's doing

34:21.060 --> 34:23.479
that's more important than this.
Please.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.899
Bye. Bye.

34:28.859 --> 34:32.780
'There's a surreal atmosphere
outside the San Jardín building.

34:32.905 --> 34:36.283
'While curiosity is growing
about the operation,

34:36.408 --> 34:38.243
'and this has grabbed
the attention of the city,

34:38.368 --> 34:42.247
'it isn't clear who the target
of the operation is.'

34:43.832 --> 34:47.753
- Think he made it to another floor?
- No, I think he changed the one he's on.

34:57.888 --> 35:01.642
Good morning, ma'am.
We need to get into your apartment.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.936
Help me.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.772
- Lift.
- Hold on.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.399
Okay. One, two...

35:22.663 --> 35:24.665
Sir, listen to this.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.258
635.

35:37.845 --> 35:39.263
486.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.439
480.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.538
Having fun over there, Van Ness?

36:05.372 --> 36:07.624
Pretty sure the door upstairs
didn't close properly.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.802
- What happened here?
- It fell over.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.263
- It fell over?
- I mean, in a way, it did.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.893
Check this out.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.697
Come on,
there's something we gotta do.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.454
That's it. Try to control the wrist.

36:45.579 --> 36:47.956
The motherfucker's practising
his backhand.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.750
That's it. Try to control it.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.836
- Hey! You bastard!
- Hey, fellas. Where are you going?

36:52.961 --> 36:55.255
- We're in the middle...
- Who are you talking to, motherfucker?

36:55.380 --> 36:58.383
- We're in the middle of a lesson here.
- Who are you talking to?

36:58.508 --> 37:02.638
Why the fuck's my dad's house raided
while you're here having tennis lessons?

37:02.763 --> 37:05.974
David, I don't know what
you're talking about. I don't understand.

37:06.099 --> 37:09.478
You're going to go and help
my fucking dad. Now! Understood?

37:09.603 --> 37:10.520
- Yes.
- Let's go.

37:10.646 --> 37:13.357
Go on. Quickly.
What were you saying?

37:14.274 --> 37:15.609
It's fine.

37:16.318 --> 37:17.986
Pussy.

37:18.487 --> 37:20.530
What exactly am I looking for?

37:20.656 --> 37:23.700
This area downstairs
measures in at 108 inches.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.827
Guys, I'm reading 84.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.293
Can you set me up?

37:33.418 --> 37:35.545
- Got the perfect shot.
- Pan towards the top.

37:49.017 --> 37:52.104
You guys can't tear down that wall.
You don't have authorisation.

37:52.229 --> 37:55.148
What are you going to do to stop us?

37:55.274 --> 37:57.526
Let's go.

38:19.256 --> 38:20.757
There's an air space back there.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.468
Stop what you're doing.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.387
Oh, Jesus Christ!
We've been over this already.

39:48.512 --> 39:50.764
As Head
of the Attorney General's office in Cali,

39:50.889 --> 39:54.434
I have to insist
you put down that hammer right now.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.686
You're currently in violation
of Article 22 of the...

39:56.812 --> 39:58.647
What's that? Arresting a fugitive?

39:58.772 --> 40:00.065
- Chris.
- No, fuck that!

40:00.190 --> 40:02.484
Miguel Rodríguez is right here.
Inside this wall.

40:02.609 --> 40:05.612
And you've broken the law.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.075
As the legal authority in this room,

40:10.200 --> 40:13.120
I demand that you cease and desist
your search of the premises immediately.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.213
Put it down.
We're done here.

40:23.964 --> 40:27.884
Yes, and I'll need
your documentation from the embassy.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.845
Your passports.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.473
Your passports.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.853
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Give him your passport, Chris.

40:38.854 --> 40:42.441
I'm filing
an official complaint against each of you.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.240
'It has now been
confirmed that the search

40:50.365 --> 40:52.242
'of the San Jardín building
has been abandoned.

40:52.367 --> 40:55.495
'Agents from the DEA
along with the Colombian special forces,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.122
'have been seen leaving the building.

40:57.247 --> 40:59.541
'We can now confirm
that the target of this investigation

40:59.666 --> 41:01.960
'was in fact cartel godfather
Miguel Rodríguez.

41:02.085 --> 41:05.172
'With the search now over
and no arrest made,

41:05.297 --> 41:08.508
'questions regarding the actions of the
DEA and the credibility of their sources

41:08.633 --> 41:10.719
'will surely arise.'

41:10.844 --> 41:13.388
'It's been a frenetic morning here

41:13.513 --> 41:17.142
'as a great number of police officers
exited the building.

41:17.267 --> 41:20.145
'Official word from the National Police is
that the search has now been abandoned.

41:20.270 --> 41:26.151
'Now the question is, what evidence
did the DEA have to run this operation?

41:26.276 --> 41:30.155
'The U.S. Embassy hasn't
released a statement yet.'

41:33.325 --> 41:35.577
Thanks for having our backs
up there, boss.

41:35.702 --> 41:38.872
I say we keep our eyes on the building.
No way Miguel leaves here tonight.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.999
And wherever he goes,
we follow his ass.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.876
We're on a plane to Bogotá.

41:44.044 --> 41:47.172
Meet Crosby tonight,
Defence Minister in the morning.

41:47.297 --> 41:49.299
He makes the call on our visas.

41:50.217 --> 41:52.302
It's over.

41:52.427 --> 41:53.845
We fucked up.

42:02.938 --> 42:06.733
It's all good.
He's in front of me. I'm about to tell him.

42:06.858 --> 42:10.779
Hey, I just talked to Manny.
They've left the apartment.

42:13.698 --> 42:18.537
Okay, good. But my dad isn't safe
until he's here with us. Call Fercho.

42:18.662 --> 42:21.081
- Right.
- Just make sure. You hear me?

42:21.206 --> 42:22.707
Sounds good.

42:28.588 --> 42:30.006
Okay.

43:28.607 --> 43:30.942
What about my family?
What happens to them?

43:31.067 --> 43:32.902
- You need to get them out.
- 'I know.'

43:33.028 --> 43:36.615
- I put their lives in your hands.
- 'I'm sorry, Jorge.

43:37.115 --> 43:41.328
- 'Yeah, we're being recalled to Bogotá.'
- Bogotá?

43:41.453 --> 43:43.705
They're gonna know
someone gave up the location.

43:43.830 --> 43:47.667
'Someone on the inside.
If you leave, I'm a dead man.'

43:48.251 --> 43:51.671
- You gave me your fucking word.
- We'll figure this out.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.889
Fuck.

44:07.437 --> 44:09.272
'Hello?'

44:09.397 --> 44:12.651
They almost had you today, brother.

44:14.152 --> 44:17.364
- They didn't, Gilberto.
- 'Thank God.'

44:17.489 --> 44:19.491
'It's a miracle you got away.

44:19.616 --> 44:22.410
'You need to revise
your security network.'

44:24.954 --> 44:27.666
Bring this to an end, brother.

44:28.500 --> 44:32.504
'You have to embrace
that this is the reality we've built.

44:32.629 --> 44:36.966
'It's what's best for all.
Accept it, before it's too late.'

44:37.092 --> 44:38.677
You, Gilberto.

44:39.719 --> 44:42.389
The reality you built.

44:42.514 --> 44:45.266
'And where the fuck has it got you?'

44:45.892 --> 44:48.478
You're upset, brother. I get it.

44:49.145 --> 44:52.273
'Yeah, I'm pretty fucking pissed.'

44:52.399 --> 44:56.486
Then listen to me. Embrace it.

44:57.112 --> 45:00.240
Look, everything we have,
everything we've ever built,

45:00.365 --> 45:03.034
is because of the decisions I've made.

45:03.159 --> 45:05.787
'Our best strategy is non-violence.'

45:05.912 --> 45:09.040
The best option we have is surrender.

45:10.417 --> 45:13.211
I'm not going to surrender, Gilberto.

45:16.715 --> 45:20.760
That was just a dream
you fell in love with.

45:21.928 --> 45:23.763
It isn't mine.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.852
Miguel?

46:07.182 --> 46:09.809
'It takes balls, I'll give him that.'

46:10.560 --> 46:12.896
Balls I wasn't sure he had.

46:14.939 --> 46:18.568
You can appreciate
needing to show them off.

46:21.070 --> 46:23.990
You again with those trucks?
I have orders to follow.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.867
And I have new orders.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.585
I don't like it,
this disagreement between them.

46:35.710 --> 46:37.337
Doesn't feel right.

46:39.214 --> 46:40.882
It isn't us.

46:44.594 --> 46:46.179
Maybe.

46:47.388 --> 46:49.724
But times are changing.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.019
Let's go!

46:53.686 --> 46:55.021
Follow me!

47:10.119 --> 47:12.413
Everything's going to be okay, brother.

47:13.706 --> 47:16.209
- Don't you worry.
- I'm not worried.

47:20.922 --> 47:22.924
Makes you wish you were out there.

48:02.589 --> 48:05.300
Yes, I know she doesn't want
to talk to me.

48:05.425 --> 48:07.135
That's why she's not fucking home.

48:07.260 --> 48:09.470
But it's important I talk to her.
Understood?

48:09.596 --> 48:15.143
'Look, I don't know what's going on
between you guys, but she's upset.'

48:15.268 --> 48:17.562
Pass her the fucking phone now!

48:17.687 --> 48:22.567
'No, Jorge. Give her some space.
She'll call you when she's ready.'
