00:00.044 --> 00:01.483
Previously on The O.C....

00:01.484 --> 00:03.661
Summer, I like you this much.

00:03.662 --> 00:05.156
God, how did I not get in?

00:05.157 --> 00:06.412
- Why are you lying about it?
- I got in!

00:06.413 --> 00:08.935
She said if I didn't get in and she did, she wouldn't go to Brown.

00:08.936 --> 00:11.265
We applied to Brown so that we could be together.

00:11.266 --> 00:12.485
I guess I changed my mind.

00:12.486 --> 00:13.178
We're over.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.957
I keep trying to picture myself at Berkeley. I can't.

00:15.958 --> 00:17.354
Check out Newport Barbie.

00:17.352 --> 00:18.952
How about $700 million?

00:18.951 --> 00:20.066
Now you're trying to bribe me.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.099
You've got to get him to quit this.

00:21.099 --> 00:22.690
I can't just quit.

00:23.463 --> 00:24.544
I went to see your mother.

00:24.545 --> 00:26.715
All you have to do is go to your son's birthday.

00:26.716 --> 00:27.419
I don't know.

00:27.420 --> 00:30.484
She wanted to make it here but she... she couldn't.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.997
Nice job on the grill, Seth. Those swordfish look perfect.

00:37.998 --> 00:42.109
Wow, the student becomes a master. There's a new king of the B-B-Q.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.450
I cede you my oven mitts.

00:43.451 --> 00:46.141
And here I thought I was destined to live in your shadow.

00:46.152 --> 00:48.621
See, buddy? No need to become a fisherman after all.

00:48.622 --> 00:50.397
Yeah, that was a bad idea.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.796
We all have our moments.

00:51.797 --> 00:54.549
You mean like you lying to Summer and breaking up with her to cover it up?

00:54.550 --> 00:56.336
No, actually, I think that was a great idea.

00:56.337 --> 00:58.695
Yeah, 'cause what was your other option: telling her the truth?

00:58.696 --> 01:00.147
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

01:00.148 --> 01:01.200
What are you guys talking about?

01:01.201 --> 01:02.675
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.961
Ryan, I don't know if you saw, but your graduation tickets came.

01:05.962 --> 01:07.875
Aisle seats. Nice!

01:07.876 --> 01:09.690
Although you'd think after sending two kids to Harbor,

01:09.691 --> 01:12.138
they could cough up more than two tickets per student.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.862
He's just worried about the Nana.

01:13.863 --> 01:15.439
Well, she is an excellent clapper.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.033
She can do the two-finger whistle.

01:17.034 --> 01:19.051
She's never taken a picture out of focus.

01:19.052 --> 01:21.043
The woman was born for graduations.

01:21.044 --> 01:22.951
Well, let her take my tickets.

01:23.660 --> 01:26.163
I mean, Seth's got you guys covered.

01:26.164 --> 01:28.284
I'd hate to see mine go to waste.

01:29.140 --> 01:31.515
Why don't you invite someone from your family?

01:31.869 --> 01:33.842
Your mom would love it.

01:38.546 --> 01:40.192
I'm going to go wash up.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.218
Sink's right here, uh...

01:43.219 --> 01:45.971
I don't think it's such a good idea, honey. I tried this already.

01:45.972 --> 01:48.465
She signed up for AA. She's starting her life again.

01:48.466 --> 01:52.161
Yeah, after writing bad checks and getting arrested and disappearing.

01:52.162 --> 01:53.817
She doesn't have the greatest track record.

01:53.818 --> 01:55.528
I think I'm going to wash up, too.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.687
It's important to him.

01:58.688 --> 02:00.609
I just don't want to see him get hurt again.

02:00.610 --> 02:03.263
- It's his decision.
- Well, he's still a kid.

02:03.264 --> 02:07.313
Right. Because when we get older, we make much better decisions.

02:17.647 --> 02:20.486
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to...

02:20.487 --> 02:24.005
No, it's fine, it's fine. It's something I've been thinking about for a long time.

02:24.006 --> 02:25.342
I haven't seen her in so long.

02:25.343 --> 02:29.554
If I don't invite her to graduation, will I ever see her again?

02:29.923 --> 02:33.252
Look, I know the last time she was here, it was difficult.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.763
When Sandy saw her, how was she?

02:35.764 --> 02:37.397
Honestly, not good,

02:37.727 --> 02:39.484
but she's trying.

02:39.485 --> 02:43.759
Maybe seeing you again will be just the thing for both of you.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.958
What if she's worse?

02:44.959 --> 02:46.872
There's only one way to find out...

02:47.178 --> 02:49.923
and if you want me to fly to Albuquerque with you...

02:49.924 --> 02:52.322
If I do this, I need to do it alone.

02:53.391 --> 02:56.487
But you're right. You're right. She's my mom.

02:57.259 --> 02:59.211
I owe her a chance.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.054
How bad can it be, right?

03:09.913 --> 03:11.225
Right.

03:49.346 --> 03:51.328
Hola, senorita.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.347
What are you doing in here?

03:53.348 --> 03:56.781
I just got back from my little trip down Mexico way.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.723
I bribed your maid with a little bit of local speak.

03:59.724 --> 04:02.222
Oh, really? 'Cause Mima's from the Philippines.

04:02.223 --> 04:04.067
Must have said something right.

04:05.002 --> 04:06.630
Hope you weren't too lonely without me.

04:06.631 --> 04:08.210
I survived.

04:12.371 --> 04:14.838
Okay. W-We can't do this, okay?

04:14.839 --> 04:17.844
What are you talking about? I go away for a few days, and you get over me?

04:17.845 --> 04:19.257
No, it's not that. It's just...

04:19.257 --> 04:21.024
Her mother might find out.

04:22.552 --> 04:25.496
You know, I told Neil this house had rats.

04:25.497 --> 04:27.139
How you doing?

04:27.158 --> 04:28.240
It's  nice to meet you.

04:28.241 --> 04:30.091
Keep that grimy paw away from me,

04:30.092 --> 04:33.556
unless you want to see what ten years of cardio bar can do to your face.

04:34.690 --> 04:36.384
I was just leaving anyways.

04:36.385 --> 04:38.322
Yeah, I think your daughter's over me.

04:38.323 --> 04:40.333
I guess I was just a phase.

04:44.232 --> 04:45.462
Spare me the lecture.

04:45.463 --> 04:48.185
Oh, no lecture. I get it.

04:48.186 --> 04:50.517
He's cool, he's got great abs...

04:50.518 --> 04:53.259
and personifies everything that's bad for you, Marissa.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.315
Oh, so you want to sleep with him instead?

04:56.252 --> 04:58.849
Marissa, the choices you make now are going to affect your future.

04:58.850 --> 05:00.379
He's not that bad.

05:00.380 --> 05:03.201
Look, you were wrong about Ryan. Maybe you're wrong about him.

05:03.202 --> 05:07.071
Well, we're not going to test that theory, because I'm not going to allow it.

05:19.543 --> 05:24.080
I went completely overboard and made you a ridiculously gigantic sandwich for the flight.

05:24.081 --> 05:25.223
Thanks. Looking forward to it.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.400
And I booked you a car service to go anywhere and everywhere.

05:27.401 --> 05:28.712
No, that's all right. I can take a cab.

05:28.713 --> 05:30.799
Just humor me. I worry enough.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.002
All right.

05:32.003 --> 05:34.501
Actually, I'm a little worried, too. I, uh...

05:34.502 --> 05:36.037
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

05:36.038 --> 05:37.554
Do you have a game plan when you get there?

05:37.555 --> 05:39.793
Yeah... I guess.

05:39.794 --> 05:43.509
Uh, she mentioned in her birthday card some diner she's working at.

05:43.510 --> 05:48.194
I figure I show up and... say hi and wait for the fireworks.

05:48.195 --> 05:50.254
Well, whatever happens, you have at least

05:50.255 --> 05:52.454
one proud mother watching you when you graduate.

05:52.465 --> 05:53.791
Yeah, thanks.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.459
Hey, Sum.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.062
If it makes you feel any better,

06:38.063 --> 06:40.496
I just saw Seth, and he looks as miserable as you do.

06:40.497 --> 06:42.276
The only thing that would make me feel better

06:42.277 --> 06:44.512
would  be seeing that assless, gutless wuss

06:44.513 --> 06:48.005
skinned, flayed and served as assless, gutless wuss tartare.

06:48.145 --> 06:49.874
Oh, well, that's very descriptive, Summer.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.350
All right, look, T. to the T.,

06:51.351 --> 06:53.359
I know you're all up with life, down with God,

06:53.360 --> 06:56.956
and you have a very positive, optimistic view on the world,

06:56.957 --> 06:58.387
but I ain't having it.

06:58.388 --> 07:02.303
Summer, I'm not trying to offer you anything other than my friendship...

07:02.304 --> 07:06.304
but you know, I mean, if you want to be alone, that's totally okay with me, too.

07:06.661 --> 07:10.873
How could he lead me on and agree that we should plan our futures around being together

07:10.874 --> 07:13.652
and then just decide, "Oh, you know what? Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.

07:13.653 --> 07:15.344
We're not destined for each other."

07:15.345 --> 07:18.307
That I should just go ship off to Rhode Island all alone.

07:18.308 --> 07:20.725
I'm literally going to be deserted on an island.

07:20.726 --> 07:24.428
Well, technically, Rhode Island is only bordered on three sides by water, so...

07:24.429 --> 07:26.209
It was an awful thing to do.

07:26.210 --> 07:29.830
And to think... just two years ago, he stood up on that very coffee cart

07:29.831 --> 07:31.793
and declared his love for me.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.999
That was so sweet.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.535
You didn't see me, but I was there...

07:36.536 --> 07:39.123
and I remember that geek was totally in love with you.

07:39.124 --> 07:42.405
And I have only gotten hotter since then. Something is up.

07:42.402 --> 07:46.262
A guy like Cohen is physically incapable of walking away from a girl like me,

07:46.261 --> 07:48.316
unless he is hiding something.

07:48.323 --> 07:49.699
And no one hides anything from me.

07:49.694 --> 07:52.129
I'm going to get to the bottom of this, and no one is going to stop me.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.199
Thank you so much for a pep talk.

08:02.314 --> 08:03.769
Another Star and ginger.

08:03.770 --> 08:05.594
Why don't you get it in a to-go cup?

08:05.595 --> 08:07.022
What's the matter, Sandman?

08:07.023 --> 08:08.310
You're not happy to see me?

08:08.311 --> 08:10.325
You don't know when to quit, do you?

08:10.326 --> 08:11.877
What's this?

08:11.891 --> 08:15.370
A projection of what my future earnings with the Newport Group would have been,

08:15.371 --> 08:17.789
plus pain and suffering, which were considerable.

08:17.790 --> 08:18.610
You want me to pay you?

08:18.611 --> 08:20.060
Actually, Griffin.

08:20.354 --> 08:22.540
He's the one I've got the evidence on.

08:22.541 --> 08:27.636
Otherwise, I think the D.A. would be very interested in the documents I've got.

08:27.637 --> 08:30.291
You're talking blackmail; it's not even noon yet.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.504
Tell your boy Griffin to pay up in cash tomorrow,

08:32.505 --> 08:34.224
or I start spreading the news.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.645
Put it on his tab.

08:36.788 --> 08:39.268
You're getting yourself in pretty deep here, Matt.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.874
No deeper than you.

08:47.034 --> 08:48.369
Yo!

08:55.532 --> 08:57.204
Did you forget your watch again?

08:57.205 --> 08:58.902
No, I came to see you.

08:58.903 --> 09:02.395
Look, I get it. Your mom doesn't like me. I'm a bad influence.

09:02.396 --> 09:04.523
Blah, blah. See you around.

09:04.524 --> 09:07.916
Actually, I was thinking maybe you'd want to hang out.

09:11.653 --> 09:13.115
What about school?

09:13.116 --> 09:15.838
Second semester, senior year.

09:17.909 --> 09:19.787
Unless you don't want to.

09:21.091 --> 09:23.573
Well, if you're going to stay, then stay.

09:39.797 --> 09:42.353
Wherever you want. Place is all yours.

09:42.787 --> 09:45.689
Uh, actually, I'm looking for someone-- uh, Dawn Atwood?

09:45.690 --> 09:47.745
Her shift doesn't start for a couple hours.

09:47.746 --> 09:49.227
Who should I say is looking for her?

09:49.228 --> 09:52.180
A friend. Um, I'm staying at La Crescenta, I think.

09:52.181 --> 09:53.698
Nice hotel.

09:53.699 --> 09:56.916
Dawn doesn't really have any friends that stay at nice hotels.

09:56.917 --> 09:58.568
I  got a good rate.

09:58.883 --> 10:02.881
She does, however, have a son. Lives with some pretty wealthy people.

10:02.882 --> 10:05.068
Supposed to be cute.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.570
- Ryan.
- Chloe.

10:07.589 --> 10:10.219
Your mom is going to lose it when she finds out you're here.

10:10.220 --> 10:13.564
I hope not. Uh, couple hours, you said?

10:13.565 --> 10:15.971
- Great. Uh, I'll be back.
- I'll be here.

10:16.844 --> 10:18.278
Okay.

10:24.305 --> 10:27.847
All right, let's review factoring a polynomial.

10:27.848 --> 10:29.576
This is good stuff, you guys.

10:29.577 --> 10:32.152
All right, what we have is an expression

10:32.153 --> 10:35.721
in which constants and variables are combined

10:35.722 --> 10:40.896
using only addition, subtraction and multiplication.

10:43.835 --> 10:48.993
Seth, you are so funny! I'm sorry, that was just such a knee-slapper.

10:48.994 --> 10:50.394
Is there a problem, Miss Roberts?

10:50.395 --> 10:53.313
No, no. Um, well, not unless you're insulted

10:53.314 --> 10:55.866
by Seth's impersonation of you behind your back,

10:55.867 --> 10:59.952
involving penguin-walking buck teeth and crossed eyes.

11:00.096 --> 11:01.951
You do an impression of me, Mr. Cohen?

11:01.952 --> 11:05.782
Uh, no, no. I... don't do any impressions.

11:05.783 --> 11:09.092
I don't, um, use props. I don't like jokes in general.

11:09.093 --> 11:11.801
Well, why don't you work on some one-liners in Dr. Kim's office,

11:11.802 --> 11:13.313
and why don't you join him?

11:13.314 --> 11:15.304
Since you're such a receptive audience.

11:15.305 --> 11:18.359
Should be a hilarious weekend detention.

11:18.795 --> 11:20.230
What is your deal, woman?

11:20.231 --> 11:22.300
I've never been thrown out of a class in my whole life.

11:22.301 --> 11:24.179
Okay, sorry to tarnish your perfect record, Cohen,

11:24.180 --> 11:26.368
but how else was I going to talk to you?

11:26.369 --> 11:27.862
The breakup is off.

11:27.863 --> 11:29.152
That's right. I broke up with you,

11:29.153 --> 11:31.996
and technically, it's in my power to technically un-break us up.

11:31.997 --> 11:34.205
-  You can do that?
- Technically, I just did.

11:34.206 --> 11:36.840
So unless you can explain to my satisfaction what your deal is

11:36.841 --> 11:40.251
and why you suddenly don't want to be together next year, we're back on.

11:40.252 --> 11:42.146
Yeah, technically, officially, completely.

11:42.147 --> 11:42.910
Okay, now...

11:42.911 --> 11:44.961
Wait, here we are: Dr. Kim's office.

11:44.962 --> 11:46.938
You know what? I'll go first.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.342
You just plead temporary insanity.

11:49.343 --> 11:51.228
It's good to have you back, babe.

12:39.857 --> 12:41.380
You're not coming in?

12:44.530 --> 12:45.548
I don't think so.

12:45.549 --> 12:48.478
Do you want to go somewhere? To talk or something?

12:51.300 --> 12:52.847
Sounds good.

13:10.479 --> 13:12.255
Hold that position.

13:13.098 --> 13:15.765
It's, uh... it's probably my supply drop.

13:16.058 --> 13:17.867
I'm having some people over tomorrow.

13:17.868 --> 13:19.311
Marissa!

13:19.516 --> 13:21.298
Oh, my God, it's my mom.

13:21.299 --> 13:22.163
I'll handle it.

13:22.164 --> 13:23.648
Good, 'cause I'm going to hide.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.698
Where's my daughter? Is she in here?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.991
And I thought you were my dealer.

13:34.102 --> 13:35.245
Kind of disappointed.

13:35.246 --> 13:37.892
Don't get smart with me; you don't have the equipment.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.569
Her school called. She didn't show up today.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.517
She already got into college.

13:42.518 --> 13:46.223
Listen up, Tommy Lee, you're just the latest in a series of experiments

13:46.224 --> 13:48.454
my daughter likes to make when acting out,

13:48.455 --> 13:52.255
so enjoy it, because right here, right now is as good as it gets for you.

13:52.256 --> 13:56.726
Soon, Marissa's going to wake up and realize she is so much better than you and your life.

13:56.727 --> 13:59.243
And you think she's going to come running back to you?

14:00.266 --> 14:05.066
Marissa knows that I will be there for her whenever she decides to come home,

14:05.067 --> 14:07.137
because I am her family,

14:07.138 --> 14:10.966
not some punk with a smirk, three brain cells and a good coke connection.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.595
You tell her that.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.835
That's my mom.

14:30.601 --> 14:32.320
I'm going to get some beer.

14:40.668 --> 14:42.860
Best not to tell my mom about the beer.

14:42.861 --> 14:45.097
Also not going to tell these guys you're under 21.

14:45.098 --> 14:46.407
Good idea.

14:46.742 --> 14:47.871
Cheers.

14:50.928 --> 14:53.287
You traveled pretty far to avoid her.

14:53.288 --> 14:55.342
Yeah, well, I'm working up to it.

14:55.343 --> 14:57.238
I don't know how much you know, but

14:57.239 --> 15:00.016
my mom and I haven't always had the easiest relationship.

15:00.017 --> 15:03.026
Knowing  Dawn a little, I figured,

15:03.268 --> 15:06.329
but if it makes you feel better, she's doing well.

15:06.330 --> 15:09.096
Yeah, I saw that. She seemed happy.

15:09.097 --> 15:11.501
There was a tattooed guy that made me a little nervous.

15:11.502 --> 15:14.376
Oh, that's just Ron, her new boyfriend.

15:14.377 --> 15:15.507
That's what I was afraid of.

15:15.508 --> 15:19.828
He looks hard-core, and yeah, he does own a rather large snake,

15:19.829 --> 15:21.565
but he's got a good heart.

15:21.566 --> 15:24.125
Yeah. They all do at first.

15:24.126 --> 15:26.244
I love this song. Do you want to?

15:26.245 --> 15:28.432
- Um...
- Come on.

15:28.652 --> 15:33.223
I don't really... dance so much. I, uh...

15:38.320 --> 15:39.707
This is not what I expected.

15:39.708 --> 15:42.353
Yeah? Well, maybe it's what you need.

16:11.478 --> 16:15.654
Well, you've got a way with people. Urban planning committee has signed off.

16:15.655 --> 16:18.102
What can I say? I'm very charming.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.595
Close the door.

16:21.390 --> 16:23.717
Your message was rather cryptic. Do we have a problem?

16:23.718 --> 16:27.536
Matt's not giving up, and since you had nothing to do with the ass-kicking he took,

16:27.537 --> 16:28.871
the news shouldn't get your blood up.

16:28.872 --> 16:30.033
What does he want?

16:30.034 --> 16:33.323
Money... in exchange for the incriminating files,

16:33.324 --> 16:35.420
which you claim couldn't possibly be incriminating.

16:35.421 --> 16:38.143
You know what-- I'm going to let the cops deal with the whole thing.

16:38.144 --> 16:42.102
And destroy all your hopes and dreams? Watch all of this disappear?

16:42.103 --> 16:44.561
We have done such good work so far.

16:44.562 --> 16:47.852
I'll deal with Ramsey, explain to him the importance of this hospital.

16:47.853 --> 16:51.691
No. I'm making Matt my problem.

16:52.584 --> 16:56.042
Well, then, good luck...

16:56.559 --> 16:58.255
for both of you.

17:01.494 --> 17:03.775
Definitely not going to say anything to your mom about this.

17:03.776 --> 17:05.229
Yeah, good plan.

17:10.938 --> 17:15.002
Oh, so that's why you came looking for her. Invite her to graduation?

17:15.003 --> 17:16.305
Yeah, something like that.

17:16.306 --> 17:19.657
Oh, your mom and Ron should blend right in at your private school.

17:19.659 --> 17:21.479
You've got to send me a photo.

17:23.705 --> 17:25.640
Thanks for the company.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.985
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

17:40.986 --> 17:41.938
How's Albuquerque?

17:41.939 --> 17:43.863
Well, I did just hook up with a waitress.

17:43.864 --> 17:47.017
Oh, that would never happen to me, you stallion.

17:47.018 --> 17:49.914
- Y tu madre?
- Uh, doesn't know I'm here.

17:49.915 --> 17:52.702
Actually, I'm thinking about taking an earlier flight back.

17:52.703 --> 17:55.405
You can't just fly all the way to New Mexico and not even say hi to your mom.

17:55.406 --> 17:58.960
Yeah? You really want to meet her trucker boyfriend and his python at graduation?

17:58.961 --> 18:01.984
So don't invite anybody to anything. Just do a quick pop in, say hello.

18:01.985 --> 18:03.324
What's the worst that can happen?

18:03.325 --> 18:04.835
Not a question I want answered.

18:04.836 --> 18:08.071
Just be a man. Someone around here ought to.

18:09.682 --> 18:12.440
You still lying to everyone about everything?

18:12.542 --> 18:14.985
I'm trying to speak as little as possible.

18:14.986 --> 18:17.612
The less I say, the fewer lies I have to track,

18:17.613 --> 18:19.126
but Summer wants answers.

18:19.127 --> 18:22.361
I'm telling you, though, if I tell her the truth, she'll throw away her future over me.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.457
Yeah, well, sounds like we both have women to face.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.650
Each who suffers blackouts of their own kind.

18:27.651 --> 18:30.705
- Well, good luck.
- You, too.

18:51.427 --> 18:52.862
My baby!

19:06.382 --> 19:07.706
Hi.

19:09.615 --> 19:10.750
What are we doing tonight?

19:10.751 --> 19:13.207
Since we're dating again, we should go on a date.

19:13.208 --> 19:18.096
Except, uh, since you un-broke up with me, it sort of put the ball back in my court...

19:18.097 --> 19:21.786
and... now I break up with you,

19:21.787 --> 19:24.758
which means only I have the power to un-break us up.

19:24.759 --> 19:26.236
You're breaking up with me?

19:26.237 --> 19:30.080
Yes. I'm sorry. I really am, but I feel it's for the best.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.956
What? I... I only un-broke up with you so that I could find out

19:32.957 --> 19:35.325
why you were breaking up with me in the first place.

19:35.326 --> 19:37.405
Well, I guess now you'll never know.

19:44.436 --> 19:47.180
- You look so good, sweetie.
- So do you, Mom.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.420
When Chloe told me you were in town, I couldn't believe it.

19:50.421 --> 19:53.036
- Oh, she told you I was here?
- And my answer's yes, Ry.

19:53.037 --> 19:54.160
100 percent.

19:54.161 --> 19:56.653
I wouldn't miss your graduation for anything.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.472
Yeah? She told you about the graduation, too?

19:58.473 --> 20:00.462
Sh-She just called.

20:02.358 --> 20:04.429
Let's go, Dawn. Food's getting cold.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.744
Yeah, I hear you, Nick.

20:06.745 --> 20:09.458
Hey,  Nick, that's my baby.

20:09.646 --> 20:12.017
This is my meat loaf. Get it out there.

20:12.018 --> 20:14.947
Hey, you know what? You're busy. Let's talk tomorrow.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.355
You bet.

20:18.790 --> 20:20.559
It's so good to see you.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.161
It's good to see you, too.

20:23.343 --> 20:25.398
Thanks for asking me, Ry.

21:21.891 --> 21:25.048
Dude, are you still sleeping? Hmm?

21:26.581 --> 21:28.148
The party's starting a little early.

21:28.149 --> 21:29.657
Are you going to call your mom?

21:30.356 --> 21:31.686
Nah.

21:38.072 --> 21:41.805
So, the princess fell off her throne and landed on Volchok's mattress.

21:41.806 --> 21:44.020
Hey, Heather, it's good to see you, too.

21:44.021 --> 21:45.860
Who said it was good to see you?

21:52.083 --> 21:55.750
You know, the dress you wore to, uh, PJ's going-away party was pretty cute.

21:55.751 --> 21:58.833
Mm, kind of plain, don't you think?

21:58.834 --> 22:01.539
You should see the way the women dress in Newport.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.814
Like in the magazines.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.870
You should treat yourself.

22:06.700 --> 22:10.132
Chloe, you've got a customer. Dawn, your boy's here.

22:18.525 --> 22:20.601
- Morning, hon.
- Morning.

22:20.602 --> 22:22.437
I'll get some coffee.

22:22.461 --> 22:25.666
Chloe here's been trying to talk me into a new dress for the big day.

22:25.667 --> 22:26.892
You don't have to buy anything, Mom.

22:26.893 --> 22:29.654
Oh, no, I-I want it to be perfect, you know?

22:29.755 --> 22:34.270
And I was thinking, after the ceremony, I'd like to take everyone to dinner. You know?

22:34.271 --> 22:37.596
I mean, nothing fancy if I'm footing the bill, but...

22:39.065 --> 22:40.304
Uh, hang on.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.346
Hey, baby. Staying out of trouble?

22:48.181 --> 22:50.905
No, I was sorry you had to go on the road last night.

22:50.906 --> 22:53.002
I really want Ryan to meet you.

22:53.442 --> 22:56.994
Yeah, no, I checked on the flights to Orange County, and...

22:56.995 --> 22:59.008
um, hang on a second.

22:59.009 --> 23:00.660
It's okay if I bring a friend, right?

23:00.661 --> 23:02.420
Yeah, yeah, sure.

23:02.421 --> 23:04.662
Uh, let me get my calendar.

23:06.098 --> 23:07.907
She on cloud nine or what?

23:07.936 --> 23:09.630
She's very excited.

23:09.631 --> 23:11.573
Sorry I ruined your surprise.

23:11.574 --> 23:14.907
I mentioned I ran into you, and it just kind of slipped out.

23:16.116 --> 23:18.021
You were going to invite her, right?

23:18.022 --> 23:19.645
Yeah, totally.

23:19.914 --> 23:21.235
Okay.

23:22.785 --> 23:27.693
No way. No scheming, no plan Bs, no wacky hijinks.

23:27.694 --> 23:31.292
Cohen broke up with me. Only he has the power to un-break us up.

23:31.293 --> 23:33.397
There's no way I'm going to go groveling back to him

23:33.398 --> 23:36.142
like some pathetic, brokenhearted little bitch.

23:36.877 --> 23:39.273
- Do you still love him?
- Yeah.

23:39.405 --> 23:41.239
There's something wrong with me, huh?

23:41.240 --> 23:43.602
Did he say that he doesn't love you?

23:43.780 --> 23:47.925
Now that you mention it, no, he did not.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.933
You see? He's acting out of fear.

23:49.934 --> 23:53.119
He's trapped in an anxiety spiral,

23:53.120 --> 23:57.215
and in the Rock, Paper, Scissors of romance, love trumps fear.

23:57.216 --> 23:59.235
Actually, love trumps everything.

23:59.269 --> 24:05.002
So, let's just say, for conversation's sake, I was open to a little scheming.

24:05.086 --> 24:08.388
Well... I have an idea.

24:11.057 --> 24:13.856
You didn't get into Brown, too, did you?

24:20.693 --> 24:21.849
Hey, Taylor, what's up?

24:21.850 --> 24:24.411
Listen, I just wanted to let you know that detention today

24:24.412 --> 24:26.536
is being held in the student lounge.

24:26.537 --> 24:28.633
And you're telling me this because...?

24:28.634 --> 24:32.060
Because it's my job as a Harbor Student Proctor.

24:32.061 --> 24:34.166
I'm supervising detention this week.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.453
How is that any better than having actual detention?

24:36.454 --> 24:38.210
Seth, student lounge.

24:38.991 --> 24:41.810
And don't be late, or I will have to give you a tardy.

24:56.001 --> 24:57.394
Hey, honey.

24:58.067 --> 25:00.107
You left early this morning, without saying good-bye.

25:00.108 --> 25:01.434
Well, I didn't want to wake you.

25:01.435 --> 25:03.270
And last night when you came in?

25:03.753 --> 25:05.214
It was late.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.365
I need you home tonight, Sandy. We have to talk.

25:10.366 --> 25:13.204
I just feel like we're so disconnected right now.

25:14.192 --> 25:15.715
You're right.

25:16.106 --> 25:19.201
Well, I think I can be home by... by 7:00.

25:19.315 --> 25:21.775
Thanks. I'll see you then.

25:21.849 --> 25:23.315
I'll see you.

25:35.813 --> 25:37.432
You buying again?

25:37.624 --> 25:41.382
Oh, you should stop celebrating and start packing. I spoke to Griffin.

25:41.383 --> 25:43.456
He's not interested in your deal.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.733
That's not what he said.

25:46.188 --> 25:48.530
- You called him?
- He called me, actually.

25:48.531 --> 25:50.191
He said that you two talked.

25:50.192 --> 25:52.685
He understands what he has to do, and he's willing to do it, too.

25:52.686 --> 25:55.037
And the only thing he's willing to do is go round two on your skull.

25:55.038 --> 25:57.016
He's meeting me tonight with the money.

25:57.463 --> 26:01.286
If I give him what he wants, this time next week, I'll be on a beach in Cabo,

26:01.287 --> 26:03.424
getting some well-earned R&R.

26:03.579 --> 26:05.914
I'm going to start my own business in Chicago.

26:05.915 --> 26:08.193
He can't be trusted, Matt.

26:08.194 --> 26:11.145
If anybody should know that, you should.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.775
I hold all the cards here.

26:12.776 --> 26:14.768
You willing to bet on that?

26:32.074 --> 26:34.231
Yeah, Heather, come on, baby.

26:38.660 --> 26:40.290
She's having fun.

26:40.613 --> 26:42.106
More than you.

26:42.423 --> 26:44.992
Yeah, well, I'm not wasted.

26:45.859 --> 26:47.687
That's not bad.

26:49.739 --> 26:52.005
Yeah! Heather, you need another beer.

26:53.908 --> 26:55.902
Hey, let me get you a refill, baby.

27:12.775 --> 27:14.331
Hey, Heather.

27:14.332 --> 27:17.286
Drink it, baby. Drink it up.

27:17.565 --> 27:19.604
There you go. Come on, little bit more.

27:19.605 --> 27:23.665
Oh, yeah, I like that. I like that a lot.

28:00.425 --> 28:01.621
Hey.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.095
Got ten bucks?

28:07.023 --> 28:08.119
What are you doing?

28:08.120 --> 28:10.262
I know you're afraid, Cohen.

28:12.723 --> 28:15.557
Yeah, that you're going to fall... Don't go up there.

28:15.632 --> 28:19.378
Your breakup was missing a key ingredient.

28:19.379 --> 28:21.704
The only ingredient, really.

28:21.705 --> 28:22.685
Which is?

28:22.686 --> 28:24.760
That you don't love me anymore.

28:26.533 --> 28:28.430
- Summer...
- Look...

28:29.013 --> 28:33.858
I love you this much, and I want to be with you now,

28:33.859 --> 28:36.715
and next year, and whatever comes after that.

28:36.716 --> 28:39.719
So I'm asking, in the presence of this coffee cart

28:39.720 --> 28:43.432
and the sacred moment that it represents...

28:43.980 --> 28:47.386
if you can honestly tell me that you don't love me anymore.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.813
Summer...

28:50.438 --> 28:51.856
Just say it.

28:51.857 --> 28:55.089
Cohen, if you don't love me, I promise I will go to Brown by myself,

28:55.090 --> 28:59.284
and I will be cold and miserable and alone.

28:59.301 --> 29:01.761
I will never bother you again.

29:07.511 --> 29:09.314
I don't love you anymore.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.390
Oh, my God.

29:19.468 --> 29:20.671
Summer...

29:21.033 --> 29:23.358
Just get away from me, okay?

29:23.423 --> 29:25.582
Just get out of here, Cohen!

29:41.695 --> 29:43.862
- I'm so sorry...
- I've got to go to detention.

31:02.626 --> 31:03.789
Where are we going?

31:03.790 --> 31:05.312
Don't worry about it.

31:05.384 --> 31:06.872
Hey, Heather.

31:23.429 --> 31:25.854
Hey. I'm glad I found you guys.

31:25.855 --> 31:29.387
Um, I left my jacket in the van.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.659
Volchok said you had the keys.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.931
It's not that cold.

31:33.932 --> 31:36.318
Yeah, true, but it's my favorite jacket, so...

31:36.319 --> 31:38.123
Hey, get off of me. Heather!

31:38.124 --> 31:39.941
- Shut up, bitch!
- Heather!

31:40.827 --> 31:43.080
- Dude, wait your turn!
- Oh, my God! Get off of her!

31:43.081 --> 31:45.014
- What the hell?!
- Get off of her!

31:45.015 --> 31:47.723
- Oh, God! Get out!
- Guys! Come on, dude.

31:48.575 --> 31:51.056
Hey, it's cool, we were just having a little fun.

32:01.956 --> 32:04.776
Yeah! One sec.

32:06.699 --> 32:09.327
Hey, Mom. I was going to go look for you at the diner.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.756
Well, she wouldn't have been there, because

32:10.757 --> 32:12.787
the girls have gone on a serious shopping spree.

32:12.988 --> 32:13.928
Okay.

32:14.929 --> 32:17.615
I know this isn't like what Kirsten wears...

32:17.695 --> 32:21.938
It's kind of low-cut, a little sparkly, but it's a special occasion.

32:21.939 --> 32:23.794
You've got to see it on her. Go put it on.

32:23.795 --> 32:24.606
Okay.

32:24.607 --> 32:27.595
Uh, you know what? I, uh, I don't have the time right now.

32:28.245 --> 32:31.303
Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I got an earlier flight.

32:32.406 --> 32:34.006
Mom, um...

32:34.287 --> 32:37.938
I was talking to Seth, and, you know, graduation is just a ceremony.

32:37.939 --> 32:41.974
I mean, everybody in those funny hats, a bunch of boring speeches...

32:41.975 --> 32:44.021
Well, it wouldn't be boring to me.

32:44.022 --> 32:46.646
Yeah. We were thinking about just blowing it off,

32:46.647 --> 32:48.893
you know, getting out of town that weekend.

32:48.894 --> 32:50.909
Uh, out of... out of town?

32:51.707 --> 32:53.769
Yeah, but, you know, I mean, you could...

32:53.770 --> 32:57.653
come in later in the summer and visit me, or I could come up here...

32:58.672 --> 33:02.425
But, um... no graduation?

33:03.273 --> 33:05.517
No. No, I guess not.

33:12.948 --> 33:15.064
You know, you don't have to lie to me, Ryan,

33:15.065 --> 33:17.696
and you don't have to worry about me embarrassing you at your graduation.

33:17.697 --> 33:18.337
Mom...

33:18.338 --> 33:20.442
You know what? I may not have been the best mother of the world,

33:20.443 --> 33:23.160
but I have never been ashamed of my family.

33:35.966 --> 33:37.683
Look, you don't know her the way I do, okay?

33:37.684 --> 33:38.735
I never said I did.

33:38.736 --> 33:40.297
It's been the same thing my whole life.

33:40.298 --> 33:43.520
She gets clean for a little while, promises she's changed,

33:43.521 --> 33:47.108
and then she meets some lowlife, he moves in with her,

33:47.509 --> 33:49.197
she bottoms out.

33:49.198 --> 33:52.253
How many of these lowlifes did she meet in rehab?

33:53.258 --> 33:56.691
Hasn't had a drink in 12 years, pays for their apartment,

33:56.692 --> 33:59.345
even fixed up one of his old cars for her.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.096
Yeah, well, I didn't know that.

34:01.097 --> 34:02.588
Didn't want to.

34:02.589 --> 34:05.044
Maybe you already made up your mind about him,

34:05.045 --> 34:06.934
and about your mom, too.

34:10.525 --> 34:13.106
I've got to get to the airport. The car's waiting.

34:13.107 --> 34:14.543
I'll drive you.

34:14.676 --> 34:17.922
After all the trouble I've caused, it's the least I can do.

34:17.995 --> 34:21.856
And there's a stop I want to make on the way.

34:34.717 --> 34:38.159
Hi, this is Sandy Cohen. I can't get to the phone right now, so...

35:13.890 --> 35:15.587
I see you brought your nurse.

35:15.587 --> 35:17.025
And your money.

35:17.026 --> 35:18.617
The files are in the back seat of my car.

35:18.618 --> 35:20.254
The door's unlocked.

35:22.281 --> 35:23.697
You're not gonna send your guy to get them?

35:23.698 --> 35:26.806
Well, he's not here for the files, Matt.

35:27.532 --> 35:30.622
Just as well, since there are no files.

35:31.922 --> 35:35.668
The only evidence Matt has is of his own bad judgment.

35:35.733 --> 35:38.552
You expect me to believe this is all a bluff?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.568
Go check the car yourself.

35:41.418 --> 35:45.353
After we spoke, I had your hard drive searched, checked your emails.

35:45.354 --> 35:46.826
You never had any evidence.

35:46.827 --> 35:50.600
Whatever you think Griffin was up to was based purely on gossip and hearsay.

35:50.601 --> 35:55.028
Yeah, well, I figured if he was guilty, he'd pay up, just to be safe.

35:58.221 --> 36:00.202
Wasting my time, Ramsey.

36:00.203 --> 36:04.379
Yeah, think about all the sick people you could be healing.

36:13.959 --> 36:15.868
- What's this?
- Your severance.

36:15.869 --> 36:19.738
It might not buy you that beach in Cabo, but it'll get you on your feet in Chicago.

36:19.739 --> 36:20.852
I can't take this, not after...

36:20.853 --> 36:22.749
I put you on this path, Matt.

36:22.750 --> 36:25.142
Take it and go.

36:28.364 --> 36:29.753
Sandy?

36:31.897 --> 36:33.300
I'm sorry.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.226
Me, too.

37:34.975 --> 37:36.847
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

37:37.368 --> 37:38.718
Where have you been? It's late.

37:38.719 --> 37:43.274
Uh, Full Metal Yaku is on, and 99 Cycling Swords.

37:43.275 --> 37:44.108
Those are movies?

37:44.109 --> 37:48.482
I thought a few hours of mindless bloodshed and violence might help kill the pain.

37:48.995 --> 37:50.366
You want to talk?

37:50.367 --> 37:52.879
I was going to actually ask you if you've seen Ryan.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.154
Not yet.

37:54.155 --> 37:55.535
Okay.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.861
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's okay.

37:59.862 --> 38:01.116
Okay.

38:01.259 --> 38:03.342
- Good night.
- Night.

38:08.130 --> 38:11.459
Before you leave, I just want you to know something.

38:16.308 --> 38:18.538
You're her whole life, Ryan.

38:39.446 --> 38:43.379
Uh... Kirsten sent that stuff.

38:43.697 --> 38:45.887
She's a real nice lady.

38:46.018 --> 38:49.619
Don't worry; my eyes are red from crying, not from drinking.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.153
I'll be out there.

39:01.927 --> 39:03.240
I'm sorry.

39:05.460 --> 39:09.049
You know, when Sandy came to invite me to your birthday party,

39:09.050 --> 39:10.817
I-I really wanted to go.

39:10.818 --> 39:12.455
But you didn't.

39:12.709 --> 39:14.611
I wasn't ready.

39:17.348 --> 39:19.341
I guess I know the feeling.

39:20.248 --> 39:24.332
But I've been showing up at my meetings, and showing up for work, and...

39:24.611 --> 39:27.297
finally picked a decent guy.

39:28.746 --> 39:32.683
You probably don't understand how hard it is to hold it together every day.

39:33.093 --> 39:35.050
I don't know about that.

39:35.051 --> 39:37.208
I may live in Newport, but, uh...

39:37.734 --> 39:40.031
I'm still your kid, after all.

39:43.790 --> 39:45.829
So I'm still your mom.

39:46.517 --> 39:47.816
Yeah.

39:49.034 --> 39:53.327
If there's a little bit of me in you, then I can't be all bad, right?

39:55.415 --> 39:57.452
Promise me you'll remember that.

39:57.453 --> 39:58.896
I promise.

40:23.526 --> 40:25.357
- So, I'm sorry...
- It's okay.

40:25.358 --> 40:28.250
Your little family intervention seems to have worked.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.880
Oh. Then I'm not sorry...

40:31.886 --> 40:34.210
...for anything that may have happened.

40:34.715 --> 40:36.081
Me, either.

40:37.728 --> 40:38.936
And, uh...

40:38.937 --> 40:41.495
But my ride's here. I have a flight to catch.

40:41.950 --> 40:45.505
Well, if everything works out at graduation, maybe we'll see some more of you.

40:45.506 --> 40:48.072
All right, yeah. Sounds good.

40:50.999 --> 40:52.248
Okay.

41:30.745 --> 41:32.198
Mom?

41:33.944 --> 41:35.575
Marissa, honey.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.688
You want me to whip up another round of frappuccinos?

41:48.769 --> 41:51.924
They say chocolate and sugar send endorphins to your brain.

41:53.582 --> 41:55.797
Come on, tell me you feel better.

41:56.611 --> 41:58.414
He doesn't love me.

42:15.123 --> 42:17.341
Welcome back, buddy. How was your mom?

42:17.342 --> 42:19.054
Coming to graduation.

42:20.103 --> 42:22.220
You really waiting here to ask about my mom?

42:22.221 --> 42:24.364
I think I made the worst mistake of my entire life.

42:24.365 --> 42:27.217
Now I need to get Summer back, and I have to get into Brown.

42:27.218 --> 42:28.295
Great. How?

42:28.296 --> 42:29.474
That's where you come in.

42:29.475 --> 42:30.340
We need a plan?

42:30.341 --> 42:32.013
It's going to be a long night, Ryan.

42:32.014 --> 42:34.472
A lot of whining, a lot of pining.

42:35.202 --> 42:37.179
Maybe some brainstorming. You don't mind?

42:37.180 --> 42:38.659
It's good to be home.

42:38.660 --> 42:40.977
All right, how are we going to get you Summer back?

42:40.978 --> 42:42.298
- Plan A.
- Yeah.

42:42.299 --> 42:46.605
I fake my own death. You never want to underestimate the power of the sympathy vote.

42:46.606 --> 42:47.452
Is there a plan B?

42:47.453 --> 42:50.020
Yeah, yeah, uh, I could hack in...

42:50.021 --> 42:53.424
through the Brown firewall into the, uh, Admissions Office mainframe

42:53.425 --> 42:55.924
and reverse my acceptance.

42:55.925 --> 42:57.936
Wow, that's actually a good idea. You know how to do that?

42:57.937 --> 43:00.400
I had an uncle who went to DeVry.
