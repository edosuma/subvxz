<i>The Client List...</i>

00:01.293 --> 00:03.191
Divorce is making me
a rich woman.

00:03.192 --> 00:04.392
Taking that watch
is a bad idea.

00:04.426 --> 00:06.160
What are you doing to her?
The usual.

00:06.195 --> 00:07.629
Like we do, usual?
What we do is better than usual.

00:07.663 --> 00:09.106
I am not
the one who cheated.

00:09.131 --> 00:09.864
Beau?

00:09.865 --> 00:11.349
I have enough on my plate,
with mom in rehab and...

00:11.374 --> 00:12.100
Linette's in rehab?

00:12.101 --> 00:12.954
One day at a time.

00:12.979 --> 00:14.335
That's how I learned
to live my life in recovery,

00:14.336 --> 00:16.104
and that's how I plan
to win back my family.

00:16.138 --> 00:17.772
The client list
holds a lot of power ...

00:17.806 --> 00:20.056
blackmail, revenge.
Make sure it's good and hidden.

00:20.057 --> 00:22.024
Someone broke into my house
and attacked Lacey.

00:22.059 --> 00:23.693
The baby.
We're gonna try again.

00:23.727 --> 00:25.227
- No.
- But I think he wanted the list.

00:25.262 --> 00:26.138
Do you think it was Carlyle?

00:26.163 --> 00:27.763
He treats me
like he owns me.

00:27.764 --> 00:29.799
You have no idea
what he is capable of.

00:29.833 --> 00:32.368
This has got to be the guy. This
is who we're trying to find.

00:32.402 --> 00:33.769
I just want
to tell the police where he is

00:33.804 --> 00:36.005
so that they can take him in.
I'm gonna do some digging.

00:36.006 --> 00:38.074
As in Sean Foster,
the guy that attacked Lacey.

00:38.108 --> 00:39.275
I'm looking' at him
right now.

00:39.309 --> 00:41.043
Excuse me!
I really got to get going.

00:41.078 --> 00:42.578
You're not going anywhere, asshole.
Aah!

00:42.612 --> 00:43.879
Let me see your hands!

00:43.914 --> 00:45.014
The client list is safe,
isn't it?

00:45.048 --> 00:47.383
Yeah, it's safe.
I've been real careful.

00:47.417 --> 00:48.684
Thank you.

Say, "Go, team."

Go, team.

02:15.077 --> 02:17.412
Ohh! Ohh.

02:18.948 --> 02:20.815
# So give me action

02:20.849 --> 02:22.584
# something to play for

02:22.618 --> 02:24.619
# give me checkered flags,
green lights #

02:24.653 --> 02:26.287
Well, you don't waste any time,
do you?

02:26.322 --> 02:28.483
If I didn't have a dozen hackers
sitting on their asses

02:28.490 --> 02:30.391
waiting for me to land
the holy grail of accounts,

02:30.426 --> 02:31.859
I'd spend all day
with you.

02:31.894 --> 02:33.561
Oh, the casino deal?
Even bigger.

02:33.596 --> 02:35.129
I'm chasing
a government deal.

02:35.164 --> 02:38.333
Pentagon wants me to, uh,
create a protection service

02:38.367 --> 02:39.934
against Black-Hat hackers.

02:39.969 --> 02:43.338
"Black-Hat"?
Bad guys.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.639
And they want me to present

02:44.673 --> 02:46.507
a system-wide defense proposal
by tomorrow.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.943
I got to be honest with you.
I'm a little, uh...

02:48.978 --> 02:50.508
Freaked out about it.

02:50.533 --> 02:51.746
Oh, you've got nothing
to worry about.

02:51.747 --> 02:53.481
You're the best tech guy
in Texas.

02:53.515 --> 02:55.950
I'm sure you'll have them eating
out of your hand in no time.

02:55.985 --> 02:58.653
I was the president of the
Mathletes Association in high school.

02:58.687 --> 03:00.722
Nobody eats
anything out of my hands.

03:00.756 --> 03:01.457
Will you listen to me?

03:01.482 --> 03:03.083
It doesn't matter who
you were back then.

03:03.492 --> 03:04.692
Now, the guy I see
right in front of me ...

03:04.727 --> 03:06.094
force to be reckoned with.

03:06.128 --> 03:09.063
Come on.
You're talented and handsome.

03:09.098 --> 03:10.999
Get in there
and put your game face on.

03:11.033 --> 03:12.033
Let me see it.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.768
# We know the action

03:13.802 --> 03:16.137
Okay,
or skip the game face.

03:16.171 --> 03:17.638
Uh, you might want
to change your shoes.

03:17.663 --> 03:18.840
What do you mean?

03:18.841 --> 03:21.976
Flip-flops are to tech guys
like, uh, high heels are to ...

03:22.011 --> 03:24.846
Prom queens? Yeah, well,
take it from a prom queen.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.314
Lose the shoes.

03:26.348 --> 03:28.616
# So, get your game on

03:28.651 --> 03:30.385
# g-get your game on

03:30.419 --> 03:32.487
I don't want
to go to the reunion.

03:32.521 --> 03:34.222
You know you want to go.
R-Riley!

03:34.256 --> 03:35.723
You know you want to go.
Riley.

03:35.758 --> 03:37.492
No, Riley, you were
the high-school prom queen.

03:37.526 --> 03:39.494
It is so easy for you to ...
Oh, she loves to say that.

03:39.528 --> 03:41.496
Oh, my God. It was so easy
for you to go back.

03:41.530 --> 03:43.364
It's not that easy for me.
I'm sorry.

03:43.399 --> 03:44.966
And especially after
everything that's happened.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.701
It's not ...
which is why you need to go.

03:46.735 --> 03:48.336
You need a do-over.

03:48.370 --> 03:50.038
If you don't,
Taylor is gonna kill you.

03:50.072 --> 03:53.341
Taylor totally caught me
in a moment of weakness,

03:53.375 --> 03:55.376
roped me into
this whole reunion thing.

03:55.411 --> 03:56.844
Okay? She said
it'd be good to get involved

03:56.879 --> 03:58.279
and take my mind off,
you know, whatever.

03:58.313 --> 04:00.281
Damn it,
I hate when Taylor is right.

04:00.315 --> 04:02.116
She's right right now. You're
going, and I'm going with you.

04:02.151 --> 04:04.218
Lacey, between that
crazy-ass sister-in-law of yours

04:04.253 --> 04:05.953
and what happened, I...

04:05.988 --> 04:08.356
I think Riley is right.
Word up, Georgia.

04:08.390 --> 04:10.391
Okay. You're both right.
Fine.

04:10.426 --> 04:11.726
Just ever since
I left the hospital,

04:11.760 --> 04:15.530
I've ... I just feel
totally outside my body.

04:15.564 --> 04:19.733
I feel like I'm just walking
around in some fog or something.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.369
Hey.

04:21.403 --> 04:24.072
You know who's walking around
with you in that fog?

04:24.106 --> 04:27.842
I am.
Every step of the way, okay?

04:27.876 --> 04:29.510
So, we're gonna go.
It's gonna be good.

04:29.545 --> 04:30.845
Now have one more drink.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.213
Then, we'll go home.
Or two.

04:32.247 --> 04:34.682
Oh. It's Kyle.
He's watching the kids.

04:34.717 --> 04:36.084
Could be anything.

04:36.118 --> 04:37.919
Hey.
Is everything all right?

04:37.953 --> 04:39.320
I was just calling to let you
know everything's fine

04:39.354 --> 04:40.555
before you called again.

04:40.589 --> 04:42.056
Well,
I haven't called that much.

04:42.091 --> 04:43.825
Well,
you called six times tonight.

04:43.859 --> 04:45.626
God, really?
Yeah.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.831
You called every 20 minutes.

04:51.533 --> 04:54.702
Pterodactyl!

04:54.737 --> 04:56.537
Okay, well, they're ...
they're not awake, are they?

04:56.572 --> 04:57.872
Oh, no.
Seven minutes till bedtime.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.140
I got this.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.209
Okay.
Do they miss me?

05:01.243 --> 05:02.324
Oh, yeah. Desperately.

05:02.349 --> 05:04.178
Now just go have fun
with your friend.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.548
I'm gonna get you,
daddy!

05:07.583 --> 05:09.117
Ohh! You got me!
Got ya!

05:09.151 --> 05:10.184
Ow!

05:12.287 --> 05:14.188
Ohh.
Oh, what's that?

05:14.223 --> 05:15.189
No, Daddy.

05:15.224 --> 05:17.024
Those are
mommy's fancy shoes.

05:17.059 --> 05:19.827
Wow.
They are pretty fancy.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.029
Yeah.
They sure are.

05:22.064 --> 05:24.165
Huh.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.700
How are the kids?

05:25.734 --> 05:27.101
Oh, they're devastated,
you know, without me.

05:27.136 --> 05:29.170
They're having tons of fun?
Yes.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.872
To ladies' night.

05:30.906 --> 05:32.240
Yes! Ladies' night,
which should happen every night

05:32.274 --> 05:33.241
with all we do.

05:33.275 --> 05:35.076
Oh, that seems fair.

05:35.110 --> 05:36.410
I'm gonna wear spandex.

05:36.445 --> 05:39.113
She smiled!

05:39.148 --> 05:40.548
Yes!

05:44.920 --> 05:47.855
Did you finish
that after-incident report?

05:47.890 --> 05:49.791
Almost.
Just got a couple questions.

05:49.825 --> 05:51.359
Says we found Foster

05:51.393 --> 05:53.294
off an anonymous tip
from a concerned citizen.

05:53.328 --> 05:55.696
Technically,
that's true.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.899
You're putting both our jobs
on the line for her.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.134
All right, Foster is a bad guy,
and his defense team

06:00.169 --> 06:02.103
will try to find any reason
for him to walk.

06:02.137 --> 06:04.472
Theoretically,
you never even saw the witness.

06:04.506 --> 06:06.741
If this gets heated,
it's on me.

06:06.775 --> 06:08.876
Just this once, for you.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.546
But we need to pay
your sister-in-law a visit

06:11.580 --> 06:12.947
before you turn this in.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.482
I plan on
doing that myself.

06:14.516 --> 06:16.684
Just you, huh?

06:18.153 --> 06:21.422
Okay, partner.

06:21.456 --> 06:23.357
Do your thing.

06:25.861 --> 06:27.261
Hey, Parks.

06:27.296 --> 06:28.830
I was thinking of
wearing our uniform

06:28.864 --> 06:30.965
to the reunion this weekend.
Chicks dig the badge.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.466
Good luck with that,
Trimble.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.135
I got to work
that night.

06:34.169 --> 06:35.770
Lieutenant.

06:35.804 --> 06:38.306
Do you mind if I pick up a shift
Saturday night?

06:38.340 --> 06:40.641
You want to work Saturday night?

06:40.676 --> 06:43.010
You may be the first boot
who ever requested that.

06:43.045 --> 06:45.413
Yeah, I, um,
I could use the overtime.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.516
Ah. Yeah, well,
that, I've heard before.

06:48.550 --> 06:50.318
Yeah,
the shift's all yours.

06:50.352 --> 06:53.020
Thank you.

06:56.491 --> 06:58.259
Are you sure that
you have everything you need?

06:58.293 --> 07:00.027
I'm fine.

07:00.062 --> 07:02.964
You have enough to worry about
with your job and the kids.

07:02.998 --> 07:04.532
I miss you.

07:04.566 --> 07:07.435
Oh, I miss you, too.

07:09.071 --> 07:11.539
Now I'm gonna be late
for yoga.

07:23.719 --> 07:25.253
She's gonna be okay,
you know.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.057
Who knew that mama
would take to yoga so well?

07:30.092 --> 07:33.995
Yeah, or acupuncture...
or reflexology.

07:34.029 --> 07:36.197
All that can't be cheap.

07:36.231 --> 07:39.033
Do you think that I should ...
I should go there?

07:39.067 --> 07:41.569
For a weekend?
Maybe go to a meeting with mama?

07:41.603 --> 07:44.205
That place only offers
closed N.A. meetings.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.309
T-the meetings are for
recovering addicts only.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.580
Okay.
Maybe I can help out, though.

07:52.614 --> 07:54.582
I'd be happy to go up there
and go to a meeting with her.

07:54.616 --> 07:56.684
Would you?

07:56.718 --> 07:59.754
Oh, I know that
that would mean so much to her.

07:59.788 --> 08:02.423
But not this Saturday night,
'cause I was kind of hoping

08:02.457 --> 08:05.693
that you'd be my date
for the reunion.

08:05.727 --> 08:08.629
You want me to be your date
to your high-school reunion?

08:08.664 --> 08:10.531
Yeah. I kind of thought
you'd want to go.

08:10.565 --> 08:13.234
Last time I saw those people,
I was a football star.

08:13.268 --> 08:14.902
What?

08:14.937 --> 08:18.306
Now I'm the guy who
gets arrested on the 6:00 news.

08:18.340 --> 08:22.209
So, you going with me, then?
Yeah, I'll go.

08:29.651 --> 08:31.886
Michelle.
Time for you to take your break.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.120
Oh, but I was ...
Go on, now.

08:33.155 --> 08:35.323
Hi.
Can I help you?

08:35.357 --> 08:36.791
I am so sorry.

08:36.825 --> 08:38.326
I know
I don't have an appointment,

08:38.360 --> 08:39.659
but I was hoping to get

08:39.695 --> 08:41.095
a last-minute session
with Derek Malloy.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.996
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure you are.

08:43.030 --> 08:44.966
Excuse me?
Derek, right?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.268
Okay.
Let's see.

08:47.302 --> 08:49.503
Ooh. Yeah, looks like
he's all booked up.

08:49.538 --> 08:52.640
No way to squeeze me in
with Derek?

08:52.674 --> 08:54.275
Sorry.

08:54.309 --> 08:56.344
You see, Derek's already
squeezing a lot of women.

08:58.180 --> 09:00.081
There you are.
There he is.

09:00.115 --> 09:01.682
Mm-hmm.
Do we have an appointment today?

09:01.717 --> 09:05.586
Well, I was hoping to book one,
but this sweet so-and-so

09:05.620 --> 09:07.355
said that
you were all booked up.

09:07.389 --> 09:09.023
Huh. I been called
a lot of things in my time,

09:09.057 --> 09:10.825
but a "sweet so-and-so"
isn't one of them.

09:10.859 --> 09:13.140
I have been pretty slammed,
but, uh, maybe Saturday night.

09:13.161 --> 09:16.030
Can you fit me in
for a double session?

09:16.064 --> 09:17.798
I think that could work.

09:17.833 --> 09:22.803
It's Lisa Munsey, and make sure
that's a double session.

09:26.408 --> 09:28.009
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:28.043 --> 09:29.844
Hey.

09:29.878 --> 09:31.278
Hey.

09:31.313 --> 09:32.680
Catch you later,
handsome.

09:58.740 --> 10:01.008
Baby, I told you to pick me up
on the next block.

10:01.043 --> 10:02.376
You were late.

10:02.411 --> 10:05.746
It won't happen again.
I promise.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.914
Mm.

10:16.948 --> 10:18.516
I miss you, baby.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.818
I miss this.

10:20.852 --> 10:23.754
You're smarter than
the other girls at Wild Nights.

10:24.288 --> 10:26.490
You think any of them could have
pulled off what you did?

10:26.524 --> 10:28.158
You were perfect.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.761
Now you just need to
get me that list.

10:33.931 --> 10:38.535
Wild Nights already brings in
all the money that we need,

10:38.569 --> 10:41.405
and that doesn't even include
the cash we have coming in

10:41.439 --> 10:43.373
from Galveston or Corpus
or Baytown.

10:43.408 --> 10:46.043
Nikki, you want
to account for something,

10:46.077 --> 10:48.945
you get me that list,
or you get back on the pole.

11:01.426 --> 11:03.994
Well, if we are gonna go
to this reunion,

11:04.028 --> 11:06.296
we may as well show up
with spectacular hair,

11:06.330 --> 11:08.832
and you, my dear,
have just that.

11:08.866 --> 11:10.667
Voilà.

11:10.702 --> 11:11.935
The new you.

11:11.969 --> 11:13.837
Lacey Locklin,
you are a genius.

11:13.871 --> 11:15.639
No, no, no.
Just years of training.

11:15.673 --> 11:17.474
Well, thank God for that.
Hey, do you remember

11:17.508 --> 11:19.028
when you wanted to do
the "Rachel" cut,

11:19.043 --> 11:20.444
and you ended up
looking like Ross?

11:20.478 --> 11:23.280
That was not my finest hour.

11:23.314 --> 11:25.315
Though I did discover
that I look good in hats.

11:25.349 --> 11:27.551
You do look cute in hats.
Yeah.

11:27.585 --> 11:30.754
Well, that is the friendliest
custody battle I've ever seen.

11:30.788 --> 11:33.056
Ohh, no, no, no.
That's just Taylor's fake laugh.

11:33.091 --> 11:34.324
Mm.

11:34.358 --> 11:36.460
Whoo! Hey.

11:36.494 --> 11:40.430
Well, I hope y'all
are gossiping about the reunion.

11:40.465 --> 11:41.898
Oh, yeah.
Mm.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.433
Yeah, we're just, you know,
pulling photos

11:43.468 --> 11:45.001
out of the yearbook to blow up.
No need to worry.

11:45.036 --> 11:46.670
Oh, well,
"worry" is my middle name,

11:46.704 --> 11:48.744
and as class president,
I'm under a lot of pressure.

11:48.773 --> 11:50.273
You can't blame me for wanting
everything to be perfect.

11:50.308 --> 11:51.908
'Course not.

11:51.943 --> 11:55.979
And FYI, y'all need to put Beau
on the guest list.

11:56.013 --> 11:57.681
Beau?

11:57.715 --> 12:00.150
It may be a reunion
in a lot of ways.

12:00.184 --> 12:02.219
I think he's coming
to win me back.

12:02.253 --> 12:04.387
What makes you
think that?

12:04.422 --> 12:06.490
Well, he hasn't signed
the divorce papers yet,

12:06.524 --> 12:09.526
and my girlfriend Abilene who
works down at the dealership,

12:09.560 --> 12:12.729
she said that Beau
bought me a sports car.

12:12.764 --> 12:15.232
A 'stang? Did I just say "'stang"?
Mm-hmm.

12:15.266 --> 12:16.900
Didn't you drive a red Mustang
in high school?

12:16.934 --> 12:18.468
Hell yeah!

12:18.503 --> 12:20.971
We were the East Beaumont
Mustangs, after all!

12:21.005 --> 12:22.405
Whoo-whoo!

12:22.440 --> 12:25.542
And that's also where
Beau and I first...

12:25.576 --> 12:26.977
Did the deed. Mm-hmm.
T.M.I.

12:27.011 --> 12:28.411
Yeah, that's T.M.I.

12:28.446 --> 12:30.013
Beau can be sentimental
from time to time.

12:30.047 --> 12:31.414
Charlotte!

12:31.449 --> 12:33.583
Charlotte!

12:33.618 --> 12:36.052
Does she really need to tell us
that she was class president

12:36.087 --> 12:37.687
every time
she discusses the reunion?

12:37.722 --> 12:39.055
Well,
it was a big win for her.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.524
Oh, you were totally robbed,
Riley.

12:40.558 --> 12:42.259
Everyone knows
that she fixed that ballot.

12:42.293 --> 12:44.194
I was robbed,
but let it go.

12:44.228 --> 12:46.930
I'm still mad about it.
I was robbed.

12:49.467 --> 12:50.734
Wait a minute.

12:50.768 --> 12:53.336
What did you draw
over Evan here?

12:53.371 --> 12:55.005
Oh, that?
That's nothing.

12:55.039 --> 12:56.506
That was just a doodle.
Just forget it.

12:56.541 --> 12:58.775
Shut up!
You were in love with Evan?

12:58.810 --> 13:00.510
I was not
in love with him!

13:00.545 --> 13:02.179
You "hearted" him.

13:02.213 --> 13:03.880
Okay, you know what?
You get one question,

13:03.915 --> 13:05.715
and then, we're never,
ever, ever talking about this again,

13:05.750 --> 13:07.117
so ask it.
Why didn't you tell me?

13:07.151 --> 13:08.585
Because he was always
in love with you.

13:08.619 --> 13:09.980
And besides,
it didn't even matter.

13:09.987 --> 13:11.288
As soon as I saw Dale
on that stage,

13:11.322 --> 13:12.589
it all went away.
Okay, when you ...

13:12.623 --> 13:14.891
Ah-ah! No!
But ... Lac...

13:14.926 --> 13:17.694
Psst! That's it. Now it's my turn
to ask the questions.

13:17.728 --> 13:19.969
Does Evan know that you
are bringing Kyle to the reunion?

13:19.997 --> 13:21.298
He does now.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.367
Don't mean to interrupt.

13:24.402 --> 13:25.802
Here on
official police business.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.604
It's kind of time-sensitive.
You got a minute?

13:27.638 --> 13:29.573
Sure.

13:29.607 --> 13:31.007
Shut up.

13:33.244 --> 13:36.146
Shut up.

13:38.549 --> 13:40.016
What's so urgent?
Everything all right?

13:40.051 --> 13:41.751
It will be.
That's why I'm here.

13:41.786 --> 13:43.920
We got to make sure Foster
pays for what he did to Lacey.

13:43.955 --> 13:45.195
Yeah,
I'll do whatever it takes.

13:45.223 --> 13:46.723
Good.

13:46.757 --> 13:49.526
The D.A. may ask you
to testify against Foster.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.895
Got to make sure
your story matches mine.

13:51.929 --> 13:54.931
Evan, it says that
the tip was anonymous.

13:54.966 --> 13:56.433
This is your career.

13:56.467 --> 13:57.934
Okay,
you can't lie for me.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.936
It's already done.

13:59.971 --> 14:03.707
Riley, you stole information.
I have to protect you.

14:03.741 --> 14:05.175
If our stories
don't match up,

14:05.209 --> 14:07.077
they could throw out the case
altogether.

14:08.479 --> 14:11.281
Now, Foster might tell the court
that you were there.

14:11.315 --> 14:15.886
If it comes to that,
you may have to lie on the stand

14:15.920 --> 14:17.888
and tell them
that you were at home.

14:17.922 --> 14:20.891
Do you think you can pull off
lying to protect your family?

14:25.463 --> 14:28.798
Yeah.
Yeah, I can do that.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.237
Evan, I c...

14:34.272 --> 14:36.973
I can't possibly
thank you enough.

14:45.883 --> 14:47.584
Double session?

14:47.618 --> 14:50.053
Thought you were breaking it off
with your sugar mama.

14:50.087 --> 14:52.422
Yeah, I tried.
She started crying.

14:52.456 --> 14:56.259
But, uh...
We talked it all through.

14:56.294 --> 14:59.229
Oldest trick in the book.

14:59.263 --> 15:00.864
They were real tears, Selena.
Mm-hmm.

15:00.898 --> 15:04.034
And I'm sure no one's ever faked
an orgasm for you, either.

15:04.068 --> 15:05.717
Wow. Something you want
to tell me?

15:05.718 --> 15:06.469
Yep.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.572
You just got yourself a double
session with "Loco Lisa."

15:09.607 --> 15:11.074
She's not crazy.
Okay.

15:11.108 --> 15:13.043
Let's review this.

15:13.077 --> 15:14.411
Um, anything,
I don't know,

15:14.445 --> 15:16.379
unique happen last time
she booked a double?

15:16.414 --> 15:18.481
She hurt her arm.
Okay.

15:18.516 --> 15:20.317
Let's, uh, let's fast-forward
to the headline.

15:20.351 --> 15:22.452
Oh, and she told me
that she left her husband.

15:22.486 --> 15:25.155
For you.
For me.

15:25.189 --> 15:26.890
Okay.

15:26.924 --> 15:30.226
Great.
And the boy becomes a man.

15:30.261 --> 15:34.497
Hey, you got your boots
and your watch and ... ooh.

15:34.532 --> 15:37.901
That's a platinum belt buckle.
That's nice.

15:37.935 --> 15:41.504
You get a necklace yet?
BOLO tie.

15:42.873 --> 15:44.341
Why?

15:44.375 --> 15:45.842
She is a fresh divorcee

15:45.876 --> 15:49.412
with a shit-pile of cash
and no responsibilities.

15:49.447 --> 15:51.781
Okay, first ...
first come the mandatory gifts,

15:51.816 --> 15:53.149
which you obviously have,

15:53.184 --> 15:55.919
and then they enter
this travel phase.

15:55.953 --> 15:58.355
She'll probably say something,
like...

15:58.389 --> 16:03.193
"I just really need to,
um, rediscover myself."

16:03.227 --> 16:05.295
Yeah, well, good for her.
Yeah.

16:05.329 --> 16:08.264
Except a woman like that isn't
gonna want to carry her own bag,

16:08.299 --> 16:10.433
so she's gonna ask you
to go away with her.

16:10.468 --> 16:11.768
You don't know that.

16:11.802 --> 16:14.637
Oh, she's a Stepford wife
gone rogue.

16:14.672 --> 16:16.172
She probably already booked
two first-class tickets

16:16.207 --> 16:17.607
to Cougar Island.

16:17.641 --> 16:19.976
Even if you're right,
which you're not,

16:20.011 --> 16:22.912
I'll just tell Lisa
that I...can't swim.

16:22.947 --> 16:25.181
Mm-hmm. Sure.
Yeah, you can do that.

16:25.216 --> 16:28.084
Then she'll just start crying
and, uh...

16:28.119 --> 16:30.120
Well, we both know
what that means.

16:32.323 --> 16:36.626
Don't forget your floaties.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.361
Hi!
Hey.

16:38.396 --> 16:40.864
Oh, my God.

16:40.898 --> 16:42.465
Does that mean
that you got the job?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.602
You are looking at the new
president of Digital Security.

16:45.636 --> 16:47.203
That is amazing!
See?

16:47.238 --> 16:50.206
I told you that you are
a force to be reckoned with.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.512
Oh, my God.

16:55.546 --> 16:57.013
Those aren't real ...

16:57.048 --> 17:00.450
diamonds ...
for a real prom queen.

17:00.484 --> 17:01.885
"Go, team."

17:01.919 --> 17:05.655
"Go, team."

17:09.226 --> 17:10.894
What is that?

17:12.262 --> 17:13.963
Oh, hey! Hey.

17:13.998 --> 17:16.532
Hi! I'm gonna take off.
You need anything else?

17:16.567 --> 17:20.203
No. Just, uh,
maybe 12 more hours in the day.

17:20.237 --> 17:22.005
Oh!
You know what?

17:22.039 --> 17:24.040
Actually, there is something
that you can help me with.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.575
What?
I'd be happy to.

17:25.608 --> 17:27.844
Uh, profit and loss statements
from last month.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.479
The accountant needs them
by the end of the week.

17:29.513 --> 17:31.481
Really?

17:31.515 --> 17:32.849
Thank you.

17:32.883 --> 17:34.317
No, thank you.

17:34.351 --> 17:36.186
I'll get right on it.
Okay.

17:38.189 --> 17:40.090
Hi.
Oh, hey, Georgia.

17:40.124 --> 17:41.524
Come on in.

17:41.559 --> 17:44.194
I want to talk to you
about something.

17:44.228 --> 17:47.163
All right.
There is your check.

17:47.198 --> 17:49.299
Oh. Thank you.

17:49.333 --> 17:52.135
All right.
So, uh...

17:52.169 --> 17:55.638
The D.A. wants me
to testify against Foster.

17:55.673 --> 17:57.574
This is the guy
that attacked Lacey, okay?

17:57.608 --> 17:59.309
It's something
I have to do.

17:59.343 --> 18:02.045
Well, if you're asking me
to make this go away,

18:02.079 --> 18:04.981
I took a big enough risk
getting you Foster's address.

18:05.015 --> 18:06.716
I can't go
anywhere near him.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.017
There's nothing
to worry about.

18:08.052 --> 18:09.385
You think about it.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.921
They're gonna ask you
a lot of questions.

18:11.956 --> 18:13.590
Look into your past.

18:13.624 --> 18:17.327
And you know a lot of people
who want to stay hidden.

18:17.361 --> 18:19.262
Yes, and as far as
the outside world is concerned,

18:19.296 --> 18:21.164
I run a legit spa.

18:21.198 --> 18:22.932
Unless you bring
the outside world in.

18:22.967 --> 18:24.934
Honey, people are just
gonna start digging.

18:24.969 --> 18:26.669
Oh, Riley.

18:26.704 --> 18:29.005
I have survived in this business
all these years

18:29.039 --> 18:30.940
because I have stayed
under the radar.

18:30.975 --> 18:33.510
You are taking
far too many risks.

18:33.544 --> 18:35.678
Mnh-mnh, no.
I will not allow this.

18:35.713 --> 18:37.593
Yeah, I didn't ask
for your permission, Georgia.

18:39.884 --> 18:41.351
Now,
I have all my bases covered,

18:41.385 --> 18:43.453
and the list is safe.
That is what I promised you.

18:45.422 --> 18:48.291
This is something
I have to do.

18:48.325 --> 18:51.694
So, I hope
you're gonna have my back.

18:59.085 --> 18:59.626
Okay.

18:59.627 --> 19:01.495
Does this make me look like
a professional businesswoman?

19:01.782 --> 19:04.230
Mm, less businesswoman,
more "pretty woman."

19:04.296 --> 19:05.763
Okay.
Work-clothes pile.

19:05.797 --> 19:06.793
Word.

19:06.794 --> 19:08.395
Is that Taylor again?

19:08.429 --> 19:10.831
My God, she is killing me
with this hospitality planning.

19:10.865 --> 19:12.332
I'm putting this woman
on silent.

19:12.366 --> 19:14.100
Why is this so hard?

19:14.135 --> 19:15.535
You know,
it's just a reunion.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.761
Do you remember
how easy it was

19:16.762 --> 19:17.978
to make decisions
in high school?

19:17.979 --> 19:19.646
We were so fearless.

19:19.681 --> 19:21.715
You mean too stupid
to know any better?

19:21.750 --> 19:24.752
Yeah, well, I just wish life
could go back to being simple.

19:25.172 --> 19:27.407
Yeah. Most people
try to run from their past,

19:27.441 --> 19:30.209
but you're trying
to run from your present.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.146
Okay, you know
what I do for a living.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.881
Do you think
maybe I deserve an escape?

19:34.915 --> 19:37.784
Is it too early for wine?

19:37.818 --> 19:41.354
Never.

19:41.388 --> 19:45.124
Remember when Kyle was away
at U.T. and he missed prom

19:45.159 --> 19:47.079
because he couldn't
get out of football practice?

19:47.094 --> 19:48.528
Everybody thought
there was drama.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.163
Especially when I had to show up
with Evan.

19:50.197 --> 19:51.564
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:51.598 --> 19:53.466
Did you want
to take Evan to prom?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.668
Okay. That is ...
uh-huh, 'cause you love him?

19:55.702 --> 19:57.870
Oh, saved by the bell!

19:57.905 --> 20:00.465
You are lucky. You are so lucky.
I'm gonna see who's at the door.

20:02.009 --> 20:06.512
Wow.
"Wow" good or "wow" bad?

20:06.547 --> 20:08.881
"Wow"...Yeah.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.716
That's how you wore your hair
in high school.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.819
Hey, Kyle.

20:12.853 --> 20:14.220
Listen,
I wish I could stay,

20:14.254 --> 20:16.422
but, uh, you know,
queen Taylor has summoned me.

20:16.457 --> 20:17.690
Here.

20:17.724 --> 20:20.493
I'm just here
to pick up my suit.

20:20.527 --> 20:23.329
Oh, yeah, of course.
I had it cleaned.

20:23.363 --> 20:25.331
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.

20:25.365 --> 20:28.367
So, I was thinking about
leaving the motel about 7:00

20:28.402 --> 20:30.069
and meet you there.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.438
Is that cool?
Perfect. Yeah.

20:35.409 --> 20:37.009
So?

20:37.044 --> 20:38.544
I mean,
I know that you just came

20:38.579 --> 20:40.346
from the N.A. meeting, right,
with mama?

20:40.380 --> 20:42.548
How was it?
Anonymous.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.250
Okay.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.918
Well, I know that part.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.554
I get the whole anonymous thing,
and I want to be respectful.

20:48.589 --> 20:52.058
I just ... yeah, I ...
can you tell me how she's doing?

20:52.092 --> 20:54.727
She's good.

20:54.761 --> 20:56.462
Look, you have to
understand that,

20:56.497 --> 20:58.130
in order for the program to work, it
has to remain anonymous.

20:58.165 --> 21:00.566
Yeah, and you have to understand
how hard it is for me

21:00.601 --> 21:02.635
to just stay here
in the dark.

21:02.669 --> 21:04.437
Would you just trust me on this, please?
Linette needs our help.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.138
Yes, and I'm trying to help her,
but how can I help her

21:06.173 --> 21:07.473
if you won't tell me
how she's doing.

21:07.508 --> 21:09.609
No. No, it's not "won't."
It's "can't."

21:09.643 --> 21:11.244
Well, from where I'm standing,
it looks like "won't."

21:11.278 --> 21:16.148
# How quickly it unfolds

21:16.183 --> 21:20.786
# How far we fall

21:20.821 --> 21:26.526
# Does it ever just
work out all right? #

21:28.629 --> 21:31.397
# Let you believe

21:33.233 --> 21:36.536
# Let you believe

21:41.842 --> 21:45.111
# Buried inside

21:51.151 --> 21:52.852
Hey, Linette.

21:52.886 --> 21:54.353
What's going on?
Are you all right?

21:57.324 --> 21:58.524
I'm good.

21:58.559 --> 22:00.493
Are you gonna be okay?

22:00.527 --> 22:02.495
# Forget who I am

22:02.529 --> 22:03.863
I can come right over.

22:09.636 --> 22:12.505
Oh, my God! Hi!

22:14.908 --> 22:16.842
Hi, welcome to the reunion.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.112
I mean, this is the third time
I've gotten his voicemail.

22:20.147 --> 22:21.480
Kyle's still not
picking up?

22:21.515 --> 22:22.748
Well, don't worry.

22:22.783 --> 22:24.083
He's gonna show.
Really?

22:24.117 --> 22:26.252
He is.
I'm sure he just got held up.

22:26.286 --> 22:28.120
Well, look at that!

22:28.155 --> 22:30.089
The class president
and her prom queen

22:30.123 --> 22:32.825
waiting on their men
at a school function.

22:32.859 --> 22:35.161
My,
how times have changed.

22:35.195 --> 22:37.229
Lacey,
I just want to thank you

22:37.264 --> 22:39.732
for being the most
wonderful assistant ever.

22:39.766 --> 22:41.530
Did she seriously just call me
her assistant?

22:41.555 --> 22:42.268
Yep.

22:42.269 --> 22:44.904
Nothing like throwing yourself
into the community

22:44.938 --> 22:47.907
when sorrow hits.
You know what, Taylor?

22:47.941 --> 22:50.443
I think you both
have done a great job.

22:50.477 --> 22:52.578
Well, and I think you've done
a wonderful job

22:52.613 --> 22:53.980
with your
"peek-a-boob" look.

22:54.014 --> 22:55.448
In 30 minutes,

22:55.482 --> 22:58.084
we'll announce
the reunion king and queen.

22:58.118 --> 22:59.752
I am so excited!

22:59.786 --> 23:02.088
I might be able
to avenge my defeat!

23:02.122 --> 23:03.489
Only if you rigged it,

23:03.523 --> 23:04.757
like you did for
the senior-class president!

23:04.791 --> 23:06.258
You know what, Lacey?

23:06.293 --> 23:08.227
Why don't you
just get on over that?

23:08.261 --> 23:10.663
Some people
never get over high school.

23:10.697 --> 23:13.966
Mm-hmm.
Bill?!

23:14.001 --> 23:15.835
Excuse me.
I cannot stand her.

23:16.324 --> 23:19.593
Evening, ladies.
How may I protect and serve?

23:19.627 --> 23:21.528
Uh, I thought you were
off-duty tonight?

23:21.563 --> 23:24.364
A good police officer
is never off-duty.

23:24.399 --> 23:27.067
Should you find yourself wanting
to take a ride in my cruiser,

23:27.102 --> 23:30.471
- just say the word.
- Taylor? Oh, my God!

23:30.505 --> 23:33.073
Oh, my God!
Kelly Nicole?

23:33.108 --> 23:36.043
I barely recognized you!
Doesn't she look amazing?

23:36.077 --> 23:38.445
Oh, my God. They are gonna
shatter the trophy case.

23:40.081 --> 23:41.982
Let's go to the bar
and get a drink.

23:42.016 --> 23:44.284
Oh, my God!

23:44.319 --> 23:46.487
I think I just ...
I need a minute.

23:46.521 --> 23:49.923
It's good to see you.

23:52.227 --> 23:54.307
How is it possible that
I am jealous of Kelly Nicole?

23:54.329 --> 23:55.963
Okay, you know what
we're not gonna do?

23:55.997 --> 23:57.731
We're not gonna let
a little school gossip

23:57.765 --> 24:00.067
get us all upset
and ruin the night.

24:00.101 --> 24:01.768
Besides, senior year,

24:01.803 --> 24:03.403
she made out
with the shop teacher.

24:03.438 --> 24:04.638
She did not.

24:04.672 --> 24:06.039
Yep,
in the janitor's closet.

24:06.074 --> 24:08.041
He was so hot.
He was smoking.

24:08.076 --> 24:10.811
Yeah, but even Kelly Nicole
gets to be a mom.

24:13.481 --> 24:15.249
Lacey,
I know this is hard.

24:15.283 --> 24:17.384
You know, every time that
somebody asks me how I'm doing,

24:17.418 --> 24:19.419
I don't know
if I should cry or laugh

24:19.454 --> 24:20.988
or punch them
in the teeth.

24:21.022 --> 24:23.290
You just have to
keep trying.

24:23.324 --> 24:25.359
Yeah.

24:29.264 --> 24:33.734
I heard the heartbeat,
you know?

24:33.768 --> 24:36.036
When we went for
the ultrasound.

24:39.207 --> 24:42.743
And for
10 weeks, 2 days, and 6 hours,

24:42.777 --> 24:46.413
I knew what it felt like
to be a mom.

24:46.447 --> 24:50.317
Oh, God, I was probably
better off just not knowing.

24:50.351 --> 24:52.719
What can I do?

24:52.754 --> 24:56.690
Nothing. I just need a minute.
Just go back out there.

24:58.860 --> 25:00.460
Thanks for coming, Kyle.

25:00.495 --> 25:04.298
I hope I didn't interrupt
anything when I called.

25:04.332 --> 25:07.334
No, not at all.

25:07.368 --> 25:11.805
What's going on?

25:11.839 --> 25:16.677
I just can handle
this rehab treadmill.

25:16.711 --> 25:19.179
I'm just not strong enough.

25:19.214 --> 25:24.251
Linette, I have been exactly
where you are right now.

25:24.285 --> 25:28.255
I just want to snap my fingers
and get my old life back.

25:28.289 --> 25:31.491
But do you?

25:31.526 --> 25:35.495
That life where
you lied to your family

25:35.530 --> 25:37.531
and medicated yourself?

25:37.565 --> 25:41.602
That can't happen,
Linette.

25:41.636 --> 25:44.204
You got to let that go.

25:48.243 --> 25:50.344
You know what, Kyle?

25:50.378 --> 25:54.181
I'm so proud
of the man you've become.

26:02.257 --> 26:03.890
You're gonna be
all right.

26:03.925 --> 26:05.626
Thank you.

26:11.065 --> 26:14.201
# I love the way you move

26:14.235 --> 26:18.538
# I love the way you move

26:18.573 --> 26:21.875
# I love the way, I love the way #

26:21.909 --> 26:24.144
# I love the way you move

26:24.178 --> 26:25.445
Hey!
Hey!

26:25.480 --> 26:27.814
Where's my wife?
Oh, she's with Riley.

26:27.849 --> 26:30.017
They went into the powder room
to redo their faces.

26:30.051 --> 26:32.286
Ah. Okay.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.720
Hey,
look who finally showed up.

26:33.755 --> 26:38.425
# I love the way,
I love the way #

26:38.459 --> 26:40.427
And he brought
a friend.

26:40.461 --> 26:42.996
Hear, hear.

26:43.031 --> 26:44.831
I mean, uh, you know what?
That is nothing.

26:44.866 --> 26:46.333
That is nothing at all
right there.

26:46.367 --> 26:47.901
I bet ... I bet
she works under him.

26:47.935 --> 26:52.372
I mean, she gets paid to ...
he probably pays her money.

26:52.407 --> 26:55.442
That's Heather.
Heather?

26:55.476 --> 26:57.377
Okay. All hot girls
got to be named Heather?

26:57.412 --> 26:59.179
That ... not that
she's hot 'cause she's not.

26:59.213 --> 27:00.914
She's absolutely hideous.

27:00.948 --> 27:02.516
She's our finance manager.

27:02.550 --> 27:04.685
Well, this is a business trip,
then. That's all this is.

27:04.719 --> 27:06.019
He is a mentor to her,

27:06.054 --> 27:08.555
and she is his impressionable,
young mentee.

27:08.589 --> 27:11.525
You want a cocktail?

27:11.559 --> 27:13.193
Sure.
Cocktails, please.

27:13.227 --> 27:15.896
Make hers a double.

27:15.930 --> 27:19.733
Okay. Lace, I know that
you don't want to talk,

27:19.767 --> 27:22.002
but there's something
I want to show you.

27:24.105 --> 27:25.572
Okay.

27:32.947 --> 27:34.881
You see those two buttons?

27:34.916 --> 27:37.217
Well, the two girls
on those buttons

27:37.251 --> 27:38.985
have been through
hell and back.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.288
And I'm gonna
save those buttons

27:41.322 --> 27:43.490
so I can show them
to your kids ...

27:43.524 --> 27:47.394
beautiful, wonderful,
smart kids.

27:47.428 --> 27:50.163
And the two girls
on those buttons ...

27:50.198 --> 27:53.233
well, they're gonna
get through it all together.

27:53.267 --> 27:57.003
Well,
I can't go back out there

27:57.038 --> 27:59.139
because everyone will know
that I've been crying.

28:00.541 --> 28:02.409
Okay.

28:02.443 --> 28:04.644
Well, I guess I'm just gonna
have to go out there

28:04.679 --> 28:06.613
and count all the guys
that Kelly Nicole slept with

28:06.647 --> 28:07.848
all by myself.

28:09.851 --> 28:12.586
You're not doing that without me.

28:12.620 --> 28:14.621
Come here.

28:14.655 --> 28:16.189
Now, what was our motto
in high school?

28:16.224 --> 28:19.292
Forget the bitches.
Let's dance.

28:19.327 --> 28:21.762
Good.
Come here.

28:21.796 --> 28:24.364
Okay.
Oh, you still look so pretty.

28:24.399 --> 28:27.534
Come on.

28:27.568 --> 28:28.835
Yeah.
Get it?

28:28.870 --> 28:29.836
Nice one.

28:29.871 --> 28:30.971
Awesome.
Thanks, man.

28:31.005 --> 28:31.972
Thanks, Dale.

28:32.006 --> 28:33.327
Oh, hey!
There's my dance partner.

28:33.341 --> 28:35.108
Come on.
Hey. Oh.

28:35.143 --> 28:36.476
Hey,
what's the matter now?

28:36.511 --> 28:38.345
Is it really
that obvious?

28:38.379 --> 28:40.781
Dale, I want to dance
with you,

28:40.815 --> 28:43.116
but I can't go back
in there.

28:43.151 --> 28:45.485
Well, you know what?
Who needs a gym?

28:45.520 --> 28:48.555
Right here, right now.
Come on. Riley, come on!

28:48.589 --> 28:51.057
Dale Locklin's man enough
for two women.

28:51.092 --> 28:52.826
Come on.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.161
There it is!

28:54.195 --> 28:55.462
All right.

28:55.496 --> 28:57.798
Oh, you feel it?

28:57.832 --> 28:59.199
Can I cut in?

28:59.233 --> 29:00.667
Uh...
No.

29:00.701 --> 29:03.203
I know that I'm late, okay,
but I'm here now.

29:03.237 --> 29:05.238
No, Kyle.
And this thing's almost over.

29:05.273 --> 29:07.140
It's not over, and I've
owed you a dance since prom.

29:07.175 --> 29:08.408
Yeah.
Oh, damn it, Kyle!

29:08.443 --> 29:10.010
My best friend
deserves better.

29:10.044 --> 29:11.812
Lace, lace,
this is between the two of them.

29:11.846 --> 29:13.413
You know what?
Pick a side, Dale.

29:13.448 --> 29:14.915
"Pick a side"? I-I'm on the side
of everyone getting along.

29:14.949 --> 29:16.349
That ship has sailed,
Dale!

29:16.384 --> 29:18.518
And you?
I'm tired of being disappointed.

29:18.553 --> 29:19.586
I need a man
that I can count on.

29:19.611 --> 29:21.054
Whoa.

29:21.055 --> 29:22.478
This is not what you think.
You know what I think?

29:22.503 --> 29:25.013
I think that your too afraid to go
in there and face your past.

29:30.031 --> 29:31.682
Actually Riley,
I'm not scared of my past.

29:31.698 --> 29:35.017
That's not why I'm late.
Can you just leave?

29:35.093 --> 29:37.728
Just hear him out.
You're working my last nerve.

29:37.763 --> 29:40.231
Look, I hate that
I even have to tell you this,

29:40.265 --> 29:41.866
but it's Linette.
Wait a minute.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.334
What's wrong with mama?

29:43.368 --> 29:45.436
She called me. She's having
a really tough night.

29:45.470 --> 29:47.405
She called you?
Yes.

29:47.439 --> 29:48.859
I have the same disease.

29:48.860 --> 29:50.294
Why couldn't you
have texted me?

29:50.328 --> 29:52.229
Well, I didn't text you
for the same reason

29:52.254 --> 29:54.828
that I shouldn't be telling you
this right now, all right?

29:54.829 --> 29:57.230
I'd either be violating
her trust or just lying to you.

29:57.264 --> 30:00.533
I mean, mama used to come to me
for everything.

30:00.568 --> 30:02.369
Now it's like
I'm not even a part of her life.

30:02.403 --> 30:03.737
Whoa,
are you kidding me?

30:03.771 --> 30:06.139
You are her greatest motivation
to get clean.

30:06.173 --> 30:08.141
Okay, you have to
trust the program.

30:08.175 --> 30:10.043
All right?
And you have to trust me.

30:10.077 --> 30:12.879
I'm sorry.
Look, you're doing everything right,

30:12.913 --> 30:15.473
but I'm gonna get Linette through this
and bring her home to you.

30:18.106 --> 30:19.706
I promise.

30:19.741 --> 30:22.009
Well, looky there.

30:22.043 --> 30:26.013
If it isn't
"most likely to become a felon."

30:26.047 --> 30:28.248
How's it feel to live up
to your potential, Parks?

30:28.283 --> 30:30.517
How does it feel
to be the same obnoxious prick

30:30.552 --> 30:31.885
that you were
in high school?

30:31.920 --> 30:33.120
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

30:33.154 --> 30:34.721
Run along.

30:34.756 --> 30:35.956
Uh, officer shot down.

30:35.990 --> 30:37.224
Needs assistance.

30:44.599 --> 30:46.066
So, about that dance.

30:46.100 --> 30:50.103
Thank you.
And...I'm sorry.

30:50.138 --> 30:58.011
# No more airplanes,
no more long goodbyes #

30:58.046 --> 30:59.613
What was that
that you said?

30:59.647 --> 31:01.415
I said "sorry."
Oh.

31:01.449 --> 31:03.750
That's ... that's good.

31:03.785 --> 31:11.785
# 'Cause I'm staying
right by your side #

31:15.663 --> 31:16.997
Nice bag.
Thank you.

31:17.031 --> 31:19.499
Lisa get that for you?
Matter of fact, she did.

31:19.534 --> 31:22.402
Don't forget your toothbrush.

31:22.437 --> 31:24.504
You know, I tried to think of
a reason to tell Lisa no,

31:24.539 --> 31:29.409
but she's hot, rich,
not afraid of her own feelings.

31:29.444 --> 31:31.912
So, where's the bad there,
huh?

31:31.946 --> 31:34.014
What,
no smart-ass remark?

31:37.418 --> 31:40.420
Oh, Selena, hey.

31:40.455 --> 31:43.390
You okay?

31:43.424 --> 31:47.628
You know, Lisa's not
the only one that has feelings.

31:47.662 --> 31:49.763
I just don't wear mine
on my sleeve.

31:49.797 --> 31:52.966
Selena, please don't cry.
Hey.

31:53.001 --> 31:54.635
I only said that stuff
'cause I didn't think

31:54.669 --> 31:56.069
you wanted to be
fun buddies anymore.

32:05.546 --> 32:07.447
Oldest trick in the book,
Derek.

32:08.783 --> 32:11.818
You are easier than me
in high school.

32:13.488 --> 32:15.255
Okay. I'm definitely
going on that trip now.

32:15.290 --> 32:16.623
Okay, fine.

32:16.658 --> 32:18.158
I hope you find yourself.

32:18.192 --> 32:21.094
And I hope Lisa finds
what she's looking for, too.

32:23.965 --> 32:31.965
# 'Cause I'm staying
right by your side #

32:32.640 --> 32:34.808
All right, everybody.

32:34.842 --> 32:38.078
It's time to crown
the reunion king and queen.

32:41.883 --> 32:44.184
Come on.

32:48.222 --> 32:49.756
Riley,
you should get back in there.

32:49.791 --> 32:51.358
Get ready
to get all crowned up.

32:51.392 --> 32:53.760
Uh, that's okay. I think
I'd rather stay out here.

32:53.795 --> 32:56.396
And I give you...

32:57.699 --> 32:59.366
Totally getting it.

33:00.368 --> 33:03.370
Beau and Taylor Berkhalter.

33:03.404 --> 33:06.306
And the fix is in again.
Lacey, let it ...

33:06.341 --> 33:08.508
Let it go.

33:08.543 --> 33:10.644
Come on up.
Come on up.

33:10.678 --> 33:14.081
Come on up.
Come on.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.819
Whoo!
Yeah!

33:18.853 --> 33:22.155
Ohh.

33:22.190 --> 33:24.324
Your king has returned!

33:25.760 --> 33:28.028
Ooh.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.934
Yes!

33:49.951 --> 33:53.186
At least I had the decency
to come stag.

33:53.221 --> 33:55.389
Well, in the future,
I give you my permission

33:55.423 --> 33:57.224
to bring
any old date you want.

33:57.258 --> 33:58.492
Oh, really?
Yeah.

33:58.526 --> 33:59.893
Mm-hmm.

33:59.927 --> 34:03.864
I suppose that red Mustang
is for Beau's new ho?

34:03.898 --> 34:07.134
How do you know
about that car?

34:07.168 --> 34:09.469
Hey.

34:09.504 --> 34:14.775
# I'm listening,
but there's no sound #

34:14.809 --> 34:19.212
# Isn't anyone
trying to find me? #

34:19.246 --> 34:22.783
# Won't somebody
come take me home? #

34:22.817 --> 34:26.420
# It's a damn cold night
geez.

34:26.454 --> 34:27.687
Oh. Uh-oh.
Watch yourself!

34:27.722 --> 34:28.722
Boy, that can't be good.

34:28.755 --> 34:30.657
Okay.

34:30.690 --> 34:31.958
Yeah.

34:31.993 --> 34:34.628
# Won't you
take me by the hand #

34:34.661 --> 34:36.496
Hey. Taylor.
You know what, Riley?

34:36.531 --> 34:39.132
I don't need little miss
prom queen right now.

34:39.167 --> 34:41.868
Okay, well, look,
can you just calm down?

34:41.902 --> 34:43.270
And we'll talk about this
inside.

34:43.304 --> 34:45.338
Beau always told me
to work on my swing.

34:45.373 --> 34:48.775
Now, Taylor, stop!
He thought I didn't know!

34:48.810 --> 34:53.280
He thought I didn't know about
Cynthia and Angela and Marcy.

34:53.313 --> 34:55.114
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

34:55.149 --> 34:58.385
Are you saying that Beau
fooled around with Marcy gates?

34:58.419 --> 35:00.153
Yeah.
He thought I didn't know.

35:00.188 --> 35:01.388
Ew.

35:01.422 --> 35:03.023
But I knew, beau!
I knew!

35:03.057 --> 35:04.825
No, no, no, no!
Taylor! Okay?

35:04.859 --> 35:06.326
Not the headlights.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.727
That's not right.
That's not how we do it.

35:07.762 --> 35:09.196
If you want to do it,
do it right, right?

35:09.230 --> 35:11.631
So, here. Will you hold my clutch?
Yeah.

35:11.666 --> 35:12.999
Great. Ready?
Yeah.

35:13.034 --> 35:14.935
This is how we do it.
Riley!

35:17.138 --> 35:17.871
Oh, my God.

35:20.274 --> 35:22.209
That did not just happen.

35:22.243 --> 35:25.145
Drop your golf club!
You two are under arrest!

35:25.179 --> 35:27.180
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.

35:30.522 --> 35:33.958
I am so glad
you were able to fit me in.

35:33.992 --> 35:35.660
It was really important
I see you.

35:35.694 --> 35:38.162
Oh, anything
for my favorite client.

35:38.197 --> 35:39.464
Am I, Derek?

35:39.498 --> 35:41.999
Am I?
You know you are.

35:43.502 --> 35:46.504
So, any big plans
for the weekend?

35:46.538 --> 35:49.907
Actually, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

35:49.942 --> 35:51.976
There's something I want to
talk to you about, too.

35:52.010 --> 35:53.478
Me first.

35:53.512 --> 35:55.346
Okay.

35:59.017 --> 36:00.318
What's up?

36:00.352 --> 36:02.019
Texas will always
be my home...

36:02.054 --> 36:03.754
Mm-hmm.

36:03.789 --> 36:05.323
...but I need to get away
for a while.

36:05.357 --> 36:07.992
Yeah.
I really need to...

36:08.026 --> 36:09.827
Rediscover myself.

36:09.862 --> 36:12.430
Right, well,
we could all use a vacation.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.565
It's less of a vacation

36:14.600 --> 36:17.535
and, uh, more...
of a lifestyle change.

36:17.569 --> 36:21.205
A long weekend can feel like
a big change, too.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.441
Okay, I've been rehearsing this
over and over in my head,

36:23.475 --> 36:24.775
and now
I just have to say it.

36:24.810 --> 36:26.043
Okay?

36:26.078 --> 36:28.312
Okay.

36:31.817 --> 36:35.520
Derek, ever since the very first
time that I laid eyes on you,

36:35.554 --> 36:37.955
I knew
you would change my life.

36:37.990 --> 36:42.360
You brought out a passion in me
that I never knew existed.

36:42.394 --> 36:44.529
It's probably just
the endorphins, you know?

36:44.563 --> 36:46.597
You're more than endorphins
to me, Derek.

36:46.632 --> 36:48.032
You're special.
No.

36:48.066 --> 36:49.901
No,
you're more than special.

36:49.935 --> 36:51.636
You are one of
the most beautiful people

36:51.670 --> 36:53.404
that I've ever met.

36:53.438 --> 36:55.473
Oh, Lisa, no.
Shh!

36:55.507 --> 36:56.841
Don't speak.

36:58.277 --> 37:00.545
I've fallen in love,
Derek.

37:00.579 --> 37:01.779
Love?

37:01.813 --> 37:04.148
With someone else.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.583
Someone else?

37:05.617 --> 37:08.920
I know. It's gonna be so hard ...
for both of us.

37:08.954 --> 37:11.622
But...He and I,

37:11.657 --> 37:16.627
we've decided to...
sail around the world together.

37:16.662 --> 37:19.564
I see.

37:19.598 --> 37:21.799
Wow. This is ...
this is all very confusing.

37:21.833 --> 37:23.100
I know.

37:23.135 --> 37:25.903
And I am so sorry, but...

37:25.938 --> 37:28.005
It's just
the way things have to be.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.974
Mm-hmm.

37:30.008 --> 37:32.276
But, please...
take this...

37:32.311 --> 37:36.147
as a token of
my everlasting appreciation

37:36.181 --> 37:39.951
for opening me up
to the possibility of love.

37:47.526 --> 37:50.494
Wow.
That's, um...

37:52.397 --> 37:53.864
That's too much, Lisa.

37:53.899 --> 37:56.500
Think of it
as your final tip.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.869
Now, what was it
you wanted to say to me?

37:58.904 --> 38:01.973
It's not important now.

38:02.007 --> 38:05.910
Then...One for the road?

38:11.717 --> 38:16.854
Well...Taylor,
you threw one hell of a party.

38:16.888 --> 38:19.790
Oh, you think so?
Mm-hmm.

38:19.825 --> 38:22.693
I especially loved the part
where we, uh

38:22.728 --> 38:25.529
went Tiger Woods' wife
on Beau's car.

38:27.666 --> 38:30.601
It must be nice having it all
figured out, honey.

38:30.636 --> 38:32.203
Uh, seriously?

38:32.237 --> 38:34.272
Have you seen me sitting
next to you in this jail?

38:34.306 --> 38:36.173
Well, there is that.

38:36.208 --> 38:39.143
But honestly, since high school,
you got everything you wanted ...

38:39.177 --> 38:42.780
Kyle, Cheer captain,
class presi...Dent.

38:42.814 --> 38:44.548
Taylor Berkhalter.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.550
Lacey was right.
You rigged the ballot.

38:46.585 --> 38:47.818
Oh, please!

38:47.853 --> 38:49.487
I spent years
trying to live up to you.

38:49.521 --> 38:50.955
Ohh.

38:50.989 --> 38:53.357
I had to win something
in my life.

38:53.392 --> 38:55.359
For Pete's sake.
Seriously?

38:55.394 --> 38:58.029
Oh, my.
The tables have turned.

38:58.063 --> 38:59.997
I talked to Beau.

39:00.032 --> 39:01.499
He's not
pressing charges.

39:01.533 --> 39:04.302
Oh, thank God
for small favors.

39:05.570 --> 39:06.871
So,
you two are free to go.

39:06.905 --> 39:09.140
Taylor, you gonna be okay?

39:09.174 --> 39:11.709
Oh, honey, I take a licking,
but I keep on ticking.

39:11.743 --> 39:13.077
Oh, I like that.

39:13.111 --> 39:15.379
Well, well, well.
Look at the jailbirds.

39:15.414 --> 39:18.716
My, my.
What do we have here?

39:18.750 --> 39:20.551
Oh, well, you're just
loving this, aren't you?

39:20.585 --> 39:22.486
Oh, no. That ... that'd be petty.
Uh-huh.

39:22.521 --> 39:24.722
Dale,
what the hell are you carrying?

39:24.756 --> 39:27.591
Oh! I ...

39:27.626 --> 39:29.226
I'm carrying you.

39:29.261 --> 39:30.828
I didn't want you
to miss all the fun.

39:30.862 --> 39:32.196
You remember prom.

39:32.230 --> 39:35.666
Good times.
Things sure have changed.

39:35.701 --> 39:37.083
Oh, yeah, well,
I got to get down

39:37.084 --> 39:38.758
with the two hottest chicks
in our class tonight.

39:38.783 --> 39:39.804
That is true.

39:39.805 --> 39:41.339
So, uh, that didn't happen
in high school.

39:41.373 --> 39:44.408
I don't remember
anyone getting arrested, either.

39:44.443 --> 39:45.683
Guess you're
rubbing off on her.

39:45.711 --> 39:46.944
Dude, really?

39:46.978 --> 39:48.679
We going back to high school
with this?

39:48.714 --> 39:51.349
I'm just saying
she looks a lot happier then.

39:51.383 --> 39:53.517
Okay, both of you,
can I talk to you, please?

39:53.552 --> 39:55.353
What is the matter
with you?

39:55.387 --> 39:59.357
Okay, if I've learned anything
at this reunion tonight,

39:59.391 --> 40:01.992
it is that the triangle
relationship does not work.

40:03.261 --> 40:07.231
Evan, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

40:07.265 --> 40:09.900
Look, uh,
you're dating someone new,

40:09.935 --> 40:11.895
and Kyle and I are trying
to work on our marriage.

40:11.903 --> 40:13.804
You guys are brothers.
You're the uncle to my kids.

40:13.839 --> 40:15.406
He's the father of my kids.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.741
You guys have to go somewhere
and just try to...

40:16.775 --> 40:18.476
Make this all work, okay?

40:18.510 --> 40:21.245
Am I making myself clear?

40:21.279 --> 40:22.446
Crystal.

40:22.481 --> 40:24.014
Yeah. Great.
Good.

40:25.016 --> 40:26.650
Hey, guys.

40:26.685 --> 40:29.420
It's way past curfew,
and we are gonna get grounded.

40:29.454 --> 40:30.788
And we wonder why

40:30.822 --> 40:32.223
you didn't have any dates
in high school.

40:32.257 --> 40:33.958
Let's go.
I'll see you, man.

40:36.094 --> 40:37.561
Prom king? Really?

40:37.596 --> 40:40.431
I was just filling in
for my brother.

40:40.465 --> 40:44.034
Your arms must get really tired
from carrying that torch.

40:50.976 --> 40:53.310
Kids are sound asleep.

40:55.480 --> 40:59.650
Babysitter's gone.
Kids are down.

40:59.684 --> 41:03.020
So, I guess I should be
going back to my motel now?

41:03.054 --> 41:05.256
I guess so.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.758
Okay.
Before I go,

41:07.793 --> 41:10.127
I have something
that I want to give you.

41:16.701 --> 41:18.269
What is this about?

41:18.303 --> 41:19.804
Come here.

41:19.838 --> 41:21.505
Turn around.

41:31.550 --> 41:34.985
You know,
back in the day...

41:35.020 --> 41:37.855
This meant
that we were going steady.

41:37.889 --> 41:41.292
Kyle Parks,
we barely know each other.

41:43.328 --> 41:46.864
I'm sorry
that I missed prom.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.402
It's okay.

41:51.436 --> 41:54.538
We got a do-over tonight.

41:54.573 --> 41:56.874
That's what I want.

41:56.908 --> 41:59.610
Another prom?

42:00.979 --> 42:03.013
No.

42:03.048 --> 42:05.382
A do-over.

42:07.819 --> 42:10.187
I want to come home.

42:10.212 --> 42:15.212
