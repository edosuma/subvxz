04:01.112 --> 04:03.580
It is better to settle
these matters in the courts...

04:03.782 --> 04:05.215
... than on the streets.

04:05.417 --> 04:08.352
And new laws are needed
at every level.

04:08.553 --> 04:11.920
But law alone cannot make
men see right.

04:12.490 --> 04:15.618
We are confronted primarily
with a moral issue.

04:15.827 --> 04:17.817
The heart of the question is...

04:18.029 --> 04:21.396
... whether all Americans are
to be afforded equal rights...

04:21.599 --> 04:23.362
...and equal opportunities...

04:24.202 --> 04:26.602
... whether we treat
our fellow Americans...

04:26.805 --> 04:28.136
...as we want to be treated.

04:28.339 --> 04:31.331
If an American,
because his skin is dark...

04:31.810 --> 04:35.337
...cannot eat lunch
in a restaurant open to the public...

04:35.547 --> 04:37.515
...if he cannot send his children...

04:37.715 --> 04:39.910
... to the best public school
available...

04:40.251 --> 04:43.982
...if he cannot vote
for the officials who represent him...

04:44.589 --> 04:47.558
...if, in short, he cannot enjoy
the full and free life...

04:47.759 --> 04:49.693
... which all of us want...

04:50.628 --> 04:52.960
... then who among us
would be content...

04:53.231 --> 04:55.392
... to have the color
of his skin changed?

04:56.234 --> 04:58.395
Who among us would then be content...

04:58.603 --> 05:01.800
... with the counsels
of patience and delay?

05:02.407 --> 05:04.932
One hundred years
of delay have passed...

05:05.143 --> 05:07.737
...since President Lincoln
freed the slaves...

05:08.213 --> 05:12.616
... yet their heirs, their grandsons
are not fully free.

05:12.984 --> 05:15.817
They are not yet freed
from the bonds of injustice.

05:16.154 --> 05:19.487
They are not yet freed
from social and economic oppression.

05:19.691 --> 05:21.591
That looks like a police car.

05:22.026 --> 05:25.826
And this nation, for all
its hopes and all its boasts...

05:26.030 --> 05:29.693
... will not be fully free
until all its citizens are free.

05:30.869 --> 05:33.963
We preach freedom
around the world and we mean it.

05:34.172 --> 05:36.504
And we cherish our freedom
here at home.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.300
Are we to say to the world...

05:38.510 --> 05:41.035
...and much more importantly,
to each other...

05:41.246 --> 05:44.682
... that this is a land of the free,
except for the Negroes?

05:45.083 --> 05:48.484
That we have no second-class citizens,
except Negroes?

05:48.786 --> 05:51.254
That we have no class
or caste system...

05:51.456 --> 05:55.722
...no ghettos, no master race,
except with respect to Negroes?

05:56.361 --> 06:00.388
Now the time has come for
this nation to fulfill its promise.

06:00.832 --> 06:02.800
The events in Birmingham
and elsewhere...

06:03.368 --> 06:07.202
...have so increased the cries
for equality that no city...

06:07.572 --> 06:11.303
...or state or legislative body
can prudently choose...

06:11.509 --> 06:12.771
... to ignore them.

06:12.977 --> 06:14.911
The fires of frustration
and discord...

06:15.113 --> 06:18.571
...are burning in every city,
North and South...

06:18.883 --> 06:21.374
... where legal remedies
are not at hand.

06:21.586 --> 06:23.918
Redress is sought in the streets.

06:24.589 --> 06:27.422
We face a moral crisis
as a country and a people.

06:28.326 --> 06:31.386
It cannot be met
by repressive police action.

06:31.729 --> 06:34.755
It is a time to act
in the Congress...

06:34.999 --> 06:38.059
...in your state
and local legislative body...

06:38.269 --> 06:41.761
...and above all,
in all of our daily lives.

06:41.973 --> 06:44.134
A great change is at hand...

06:44.375 --> 06:45.706
...and our task...

06:45.910 --> 06:49.175
...our obligation is to make
that revolution, that change...

06:49.747 --> 06:52.045
...peaceful and constructive for all.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.649
Those who do nothing...

06:53.985 --> 06:56.954
...are inviting shame
as well as violence.

06:57.555 --> 07:00.149
Those who act boldly
are recognizing right...

07:01.426 --> 07:02.893
...as well as reality.

07:04.228 --> 07:05.058
Medgar!

07:05.263 --> 07:06.992
-Get down!
-Get the baby!

07:11.336 --> 07:12.564
Medgar!

07:22.113 --> 07:23.808
Oh, my God!

07:27.151 --> 07:29.483
Daddy! Daddy!

07:29.687 --> 07:31.211
Daddy, I love you!

07:34.425 --> 07:36.188
Daddy, don't die!

07:37.495 --> 07:39.326
I want my daddy!

07:44.369 --> 07:46.064
Turn me loose.

07:46.804 --> 07:48.396
Turn me loose.

07:55.446 --> 07:59.473
Medgar Evers believed in this country.

08:00.284 --> 08:04.311
It now remains to be seen
whether his country believed in him.

08:21.873 --> 08:24.603
The Citizens Council's raised
thousands for your defense.

08:24.809 --> 08:26.936
Money's pouring in
from all over the South.

08:27.145 --> 08:29.613
Nice likeness.
What do you think, boys?

08:29.814 --> 08:31.577
Mr. Beckwith, glad to see you.

08:31.783 --> 08:33.774
Mighty glad to be here.

08:34.452 --> 08:36.919
And isn't it true
your husband was the first...

08:37.121 --> 08:40.022
...to attempt to integrate
the University of Mississippi?

08:41.659 --> 08:44.287
At the time of his death,
he was involved in a lawsuit...

08:44.495 --> 08:47.362
...to integrate the public
school system, wasn't he?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.265
Your husband must've had quite
a few enemies, would you agree?

08:52.470 --> 08:53.767
Yes, he did.

08:53.971 --> 08:57.202
Your eldest boy,
his name is Kenyatta, isn't it?

08:57.475 --> 08:59.739
Darrell Kenyatta Evers.

09:00.111 --> 09:02.079
Kenyatta's a Mau Mau name, isn't it?

09:02.280 --> 09:03.269
Objection.

09:03.481 --> 09:04.675
Sustained.

09:04.882 --> 09:09.046
Isn't it true that over 100 people
were arrested during a demonstration...

09:09.253 --> 09:11.448
...that your husband
organized boycotting...

09:11.956 --> 09:15.551
...a department store in downtown
Jackson known as Kennington's?

09:15.827 --> 09:17.158
Who's that?

09:17.829 --> 09:19.057
Ross Barnett.

09:19.263 --> 09:20.730
You're kidding.

09:21.332 --> 09:24.358
Nope. You don't see that
every day of the week.

09:24.569 --> 09:28.505
A former governor shaking hands
with an assassin in front of the jury.

09:28.706 --> 09:31.869
There's not a court in America
that would stand for that.

09:32.076 --> 09:34.203
What's America got to do
with anything?

09:34.412 --> 09:36.073
This is Mississippi.

09:36.547 --> 09:38.515
Byron De La Beckwith.

09:38.916 --> 09:41.578
-You live in Greenwood, Mississippi?
-Y es, sir.

09:41.786 --> 09:43.720
My mother was a Yerger.

09:43.921 --> 09:45.786
Her mother was Susan Yerger...

09:45.990 --> 09:48.982
...a close personal friend
of Mrs. Jefferson Davis.

09:49.193 --> 09:50.888
You shoot Medgar Evers?

09:51.095 --> 09:52.255
No, sir!

09:53.297 --> 09:55.197
Your Honor, may l?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.366
Mr. Beckwith, is this your rifle?

09:59.137 --> 10:00.035
Let's see.

10:02.540 --> 10:05.771
Well, it bears a similarity...

10:05.977 --> 10:08.070
...but I couldn't say for certain.

10:08.312 --> 10:11.042
I don't record the
serial numbers of my weapons...

10:11.249 --> 10:15.879
...and my gun was stolen
from my home several days before...

10:16.154 --> 10:17.678
...this whole business.

10:48.319 --> 10:50.014
How do you feel, Delay?

10:50.254 --> 10:52.745
I got tears in my eyes.

10:52.990 --> 10:54.287
For Dixie, huh?

11:14.812 --> 11:15.938
In summation...

11:16.147 --> 11:19.514
...not only did surveillance cameras
provide us with a visual record...

11:19.851 --> 11:21.580
...of the crime being committed...

11:21.786 --> 11:26.189
...but four eyewitnesses observed
the defendant removing his mask...

11:26.390 --> 11:28.881
...upon exiting the convenience store.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.989
Short of you ladies and gentlemen
attending the actual event...

11:33.197 --> 11:36.462
...we don't feel the state
could have a stronger case.

11:36.701 --> 11:37.531
Thank you.

11:38.569 --> 11:39.695
Counsel?

11:41.439 --> 11:43.373
Hey, Bobby. How'd it go?

11:43.674 --> 11:46.336
Through a combination
of superior lawyering...

11:46.544 --> 11:50.708
...and a less than stellar performance
by our criminal, I got a conviction.

11:50.915 --> 11:52.007
Congratulations.

11:52.250 --> 11:56.482
My rape victim's reluctant to testify.
Can you handle the Harrison motion?

11:56.687 --> 11:58.279
-You bet.
-You're a lifesaver.

11:58.489 --> 12:01.458
-DeLaughter, your wife just called.
-What'd she want?

12:01.659 --> 12:05.993
To remind you you're having lunch with
her mother and your parents at 1:00.

12:06.197 --> 12:07.994
How could I forget?

12:08.232 --> 12:09.324
Bobby.

12:11.702 --> 12:14.136
-You seen this?
-Yes, I have.

12:14.338 --> 12:17.796
Evers' widow is calling for
the re-prosecution of De La Beckwith.

12:18.009 --> 12:20.443
Ed, this guy was killed
over 25 years ago.

12:20.945 --> 12:24.676
Dig up whatever you can on Medgar Evers
and be in my office at 3:00.

12:24.882 --> 12:26.372
Ed, this is ridiculous.

12:26.584 --> 12:27.642
Well, sure it is.

12:27.852 --> 12:29.149
But if we try to bury this...

12:29.353 --> 12:32.447
...she'll have every black politician
climbing all over me.

12:33.324 --> 12:35.451
My office, 3:00.

12:45.469 --> 12:47.903
Do we have any files here
on Medgar Evers?

12:48.105 --> 12:48.935
Who?

12:49.140 --> 12:52.871
The civil rights leader
that got himself shot in the 1960s?

12:53.077 --> 12:57.343
I just saw that file. It was next
to the one on the Lindbergh baby.

12:57.715 --> 13:00.149
Clara, just bring me what we have.

13:10.795 --> 13:12.126
Good afternoon, sir.

13:23.140 --> 13:25.404
Did you make Hinds County safer today?

13:25.609 --> 13:29.739
You know how it is with criminals.
It's like finding a gray hair.

13:29.981 --> 13:32.643
You pull one and two more pop up
to take its place.

13:33.417 --> 13:36.113
I love those earrings.
Have you worn them before?

13:36.320 --> 13:40.450
I've had them for quite some time.
I just never wear them during the day.

13:40.658 --> 13:43.855
You see that nonsense
about the Sovereignty Commission?

13:44.061 --> 13:45.756
Yeah, isn't that awful?

13:46.230 --> 13:49.529
That fool, Rea Hederman.
Since he took over that paper...

13:49.734 --> 13:53.101
...Iiberals like Jerry Mitchell
been trying to rewrite history.

13:53.537 --> 13:57.997
The Sovereignty Commission was a fine
organization that did a lot of good.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.505
Dixie, would you pass me the butter?

14:00.778 --> 14:04.179
Why do they dig up things
that happened 25 years ago anyway?

14:04.382 --> 14:07.180
Medgar Evers' widow
wants to reopen the case.

14:07.685 --> 14:09.516
You can't be serious.

14:09.854 --> 14:11.788
Ed asked me to look into it.

14:15.459 --> 14:17.586
You just tell him, "No, thank you."

14:17.795 --> 14:22.164
When will these people get it through
their heads that the '60s are over?

14:22.366 --> 14:25.802
The 1860s and the 1960s.

14:26.037 --> 14:29.029
I thought they found
that Beckwith fella not guilty.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.073
Actually, there were two hung juries.

14:33.310 --> 14:36.711
The reason I know is because
my late husband, Judge Moore...

14:36.914 --> 14:39.246
...was a spectator
at both those trials.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.949
He'd never miss a day.
And he told me...

14:42.219 --> 14:46.815
...that they'd never convict Beckwith,
no matter how many trials they had.

14:47.158 --> 14:50.525
It's just political. I don't
think anything will come of it.

14:50.728 --> 14:53.128
Son, for your sake,
it had better not.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.195
You want to be a judge someday.

14:55.399 --> 14:59.267
You persecute a 70-year-old man,
guilty or not, over some nigger...

14:59.470 --> 15:02.928
...you'll have everybody in Mississippi
lined up against you.

15:03.140 --> 15:04.732
-Hey, Howard.
-How you doing?

15:04.942 --> 15:07.570
Y'all got any
of that crawdad chowder today?

15:07.778 --> 15:08.972
Yes, sir.

15:09.180 --> 15:12.013
-How many for crawdad chowder?
-Oh, come on!

15:13.751 --> 15:17.448
Mrs. Evers, Mr. Dees, I'm Jerry Mitchell
from The Clarion-Ledger.

15:17.655 --> 15:20.647
I broke the story on the jury
tampering in your husband's case.

15:21.992 --> 15:23.391
-I talked to you on the phone.
-That's right.

15:23.594 --> 15:27.792
Thank you for your good work. I can't
tell you how much it's appreciated.

15:27.998 --> 15:29.761
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

15:29.967 --> 15:33.960
What do you think your chances are
of getting the D.A. to reopen the case?

15:34.171 --> 15:36.162
I've passed this way before.

15:36.373 --> 15:40.366
Let's just say I've adopted
an attitude of tempered optimism.

15:43.848 --> 15:45.475
DeLaughter, hear the news?

15:45.683 --> 15:47.844
President Lincoln just got shot.

15:48.052 --> 15:50.316
Some guy named Booth did it.

15:51.822 --> 15:55.781
The Sovereignty Commission, a state
agency, worked against the D.A...

15:55.993 --> 15:59.986
...to ensure the jury had Beckwith
sympathizers to keep him out of jail.

16:00.197 --> 16:02.358
That's grounds for a new trial.

16:02.566 --> 16:03.658
With all due respect...

16:03.868 --> 16:07.201
...those old files have been
leaking out for years.

16:07.404 --> 16:11.636
They only ran background checks which,
while unethical, was not illegal.

16:11.842 --> 16:16.074
We can't prove jury tampering.
I'd like you to meet Bob DeLaughter.

16:16.547 --> 16:17.377
How do you do?

16:17.748 --> 16:19.648
-Pleasure.
-Mr. Morris Dees...

16:19.850 --> 16:21.374
...the Southern Poverty Law Center.

16:21.619 --> 16:23.314
-How you doing?
-I was explaining...

16:23.521 --> 16:25.318
...that in order for us
to pursue this...

16:25.523 --> 16:27.991
...we'll need more
than an article in a newspaper.

16:28.192 --> 16:29.557
We'll need new evidence.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.660
In 1964, you had
a mountain of evidence.

16:31.862 --> 16:33.659
All you gotta do is retry Beckwith.

16:33.864 --> 16:36.389
On the basis of that alone,
you'll get a conviction.

16:37.668 --> 16:40.899
As you can see, the mountain
has crumbled a bit.

16:42.039 --> 16:43.028
What's this?

16:43.240 --> 16:46.937
That's all that's left of the
state's case against De La Beckwith.

16:47.144 --> 16:50.079
Just a few pages
of the old police report.

16:50.281 --> 16:53.079
-Where's the gun? Where--
-Where's the bullet?

16:53.350 --> 16:57.184
Where's the original trial transcript?
Where are the files? Beats me.

16:58.822 --> 17:00.619
Are you telling us it is lost?

17:00.824 --> 17:02.689
I'm telling you, we don't have it.

17:02.993 --> 17:04.221
Well, that's outrageous.

17:05.061 --> 17:07.963
Even if we had the evidence,
we'd never get around...

17:08.165 --> 17:11.362
...to the Sixth Amendment right
to a speedy trial.

17:11.569 --> 17:15.561
Mr. Dees would agree that 25 years
isn't exactly what you'd call speedy.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.267
May I see that?

17:18.474 --> 17:20.568
Mrs. Evers, this is
pretty strong stuff.

17:21.412 --> 17:22.640
I'd like to see it.

17:32.590 --> 17:35.081
"June 13, 1963.

17:35.392 --> 17:37.724
To the Jackson Police Department:

17:38.062 --> 17:41.930
When you catch whoever killed
the nigger, pin a medal on him...

17:42.333 --> 17:46.167
...because he just did Mississippi
one hell of a favor.

17:47.271 --> 17:49.933
June 14, 1963.

17:50.140 --> 17:52.973
A female who refused
to identify herself stated...

17:53.177 --> 17:56.408
...that she'd heard a rumor
that Medgar Evers' wife...

17:56.647 --> 18:00.583
...had gotten jealous of Lena Horne,
who appeared with Evers at a rally...

18:00.784 --> 18:04.345
...and might have gotten
her brother-in-law to kill Evers."

18:07.024 --> 18:10.755
Who wouldn't be jealous of Lena Horne?
What a beautiful woman.

18:11.795 --> 18:13.023
Y es, ma'am.

18:13.230 --> 18:17.826
The cops wrote that garbage down
because they actually took it seriously.

18:18.035 --> 18:18.967
Mr. Dees.

18:19.536 --> 18:23.700
Do you think the police in Washington,
D.C. would have written it up...

18:23.907 --> 18:27.638
...if some nitwit said Jackie Kennedy
had a hand in J.F.K.'s death...

18:27.845 --> 18:30.643
...because her husband ran around
with Marilyn Monroe?

18:30.881 --> 18:32.007
What's your point?

18:32.216 --> 18:35.276
The murder of Medgar Evers
was a race crime...

18:35.486 --> 18:37.511
...a political crime.
An assassination.

18:37.888 --> 18:39.856
Beckwith is free today...

18:40.057 --> 18:42.582
...thanks to a racist jury,
a racist police department...

18:42.793 --> 18:44.954
...and a racist D.A.'s office.

18:45.162 --> 18:47.630
Twenty-five years ago,
Waller and this office...

18:47.831 --> 18:49.958
...went after Beckwith
not once but twice.

18:50.167 --> 18:52.226
I don't need to sit here and listen--

18:52.936 --> 18:56.201
Twenty-five years ago,
I sat on the witness stand...

18:56.407 --> 18:59.638
...and I watched as the former
governor of this state...

18:59.843 --> 19:03.006
...shook hands with the man
who murdered my husband...

19:03.814 --> 19:05.509
...while I was on the stand.

19:08.585 --> 19:10.485
I don't expect you to understand...

19:10.688 --> 19:13.122
...the pain and suffering
my family went through...

19:13.324 --> 19:14.985
...but I did come here thinking...

19:15.192 --> 19:18.889
...that this office might want
to see justice finally served.

19:21.999 --> 19:25.435
You've given me all the reasons
why you can't pursue this.

19:25.636 --> 19:28.764
Perhaps you can find
one reason why you can.

19:29.406 --> 19:31.203
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

19:51.128 --> 19:52.618
Ed Peters is a good man...

19:52.830 --> 19:55.424
...but as you can see,
we simply don't have a case.

19:55.632 --> 19:59.466
I know you've been living
with this thing for a long while...

20:00.471 --> 20:02.632
...but maybe it's just time you....

20:03.707 --> 20:04.969
Let it go?

20:05.542 --> 20:08.409
I can understand why you'd
think that, Mr. DeLaughter.

20:08.612 --> 20:10.978
For years, I said
the same thing to Medgar.

20:11.181 --> 20:13.911
"Let it go.
Let's get out of Mississippi."

20:14.418 --> 20:16.215
Do you know what he said to me?

20:16.820 --> 20:19.311
" I don't know if I'm going
to heaven or to hell...

20:19.523 --> 20:21.650
...but I'm going from Jackson."

20:22.259 --> 20:24.056
Good afternoon, Mr. DeLaughter.

20:56.827 --> 20:58.692
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

21:07.104 --> 21:08.298
Hey, tiger.

21:08.972 --> 21:10.200
Hi, Dad.

21:11.141 --> 21:15.043
You sure you got enough distractions?
I can go get your Game Boy.

21:15.646 --> 21:16.772
Dad.

21:16.980 --> 21:18.208
Hi, Daddy.

21:18.649 --> 21:19.581
Hi, Dad.

21:19.783 --> 21:23.844
-Did you bring me a lollipop?
-I did. I got one for Claire too.

21:24.054 --> 21:27.023
-Thanks, Daddy.
-How was school today, sweetie?

21:27.224 --> 21:29.522
Did Miss Collins like
the bracelet you made?

21:29.827 --> 21:31.556
Daddy, tell us a story.

21:32.262 --> 21:35.129
-A real scary one.
-Claire, you want to hear a story?

21:35.332 --> 21:37.300
Okay, but not too scary.

21:37.501 --> 21:41.198
Let's go to Mommy and Daddy's room,
because we don't wanna disturb Burt.

21:44.575 --> 21:48.102
-You want something to eat?
-No, I got something at the office.

21:49.947 --> 21:51.676
Thanks for letting me know.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.016
Honey, what are you doing up?

22:36.226 --> 22:37.693
I can't sleep.

22:37.895 --> 22:39.556
The ghost is back.

22:39.963 --> 22:42.056
I'll go. I'll go.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.101
The ghost is back?
Where is he this time?

22:46.303 --> 22:47.270
In my bed.

22:47.471 --> 22:50.565
Really? We'll just have
to see about that.

22:53.977 --> 22:56.810
You were right.
He's right there on the bed.

22:57.514 --> 22:58.606
No, Daddy.

22:58.815 --> 23:00.976
Now he's over by the window.

23:03.387 --> 23:04.649
I see.

23:06.290 --> 23:08.588
Your bottle tree was
supposed to keep him away.

23:08.926 --> 23:11.588
Maybe I don't have
the right kind of bottles.

23:11.929 --> 23:13.328
You know, baby...

23:14.398 --> 23:16.832
...when we lived in Natchez,
there was a ghost...

23:17.034 --> 23:18.626
...that lived right next door...

23:18.835 --> 23:21.963
...in the remains of this house
that got burned during the war.

23:22.439 --> 23:26.307
And sometimes he'd come over
and get right in my closet.

23:26.610 --> 23:27.804
How'd you make him go away?

23:28.178 --> 23:30.578
Granny would come in
and sing a song...

23:30.781 --> 23:32.806
...and before you knew it,
he was gone.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.108
What'd she sing?

23:35.552 --> 23:38.419
She sang the song every ghost
from Mississippi loves.

23:38.922 --> 23:40.014
Sing it, Daddy.

23:40.524 --> 23:41.684
All right.

23:43.060 --> 23:46.188
I wish I was in the land of cotton

23:46.396 --> 23:48.626
Old times there are not forgotten

23:48.832 --> 23:50.129
Look away

23:50.434 --> 23:51.765
Look away

23:52.035 --> 23:55.334
Look away, Dixieland

23:55.539 --> 23:57.871
In Dixieland where I was born

23:58.208 --> 24:00.836
Early on one frosty morn'

24:01.178 --> 24:03.806
Look away, look away

24:04.014 --> 24:07.142
Look away, Dixieland

24:07.718 --> 24:09.948
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie

24:10.153 --> 24:12.917
Hooray, hooray

24:13.123 --> 24:15.819
In Dixieland I'll take my stand

24:16.026 --> 24:18.995
To live and die in Dixie

24:19.196 --> 24:21.289
Away, away

24:21.565 --> 24:24.159
Away down South

24:24.601 --> 24:26.432
In Dixie

24:30.440 --> 24:32.772
I'd ask what's new,
but I'm afraid you'd tell me.

24:32.976 --> 24:35.536
My readers are on the edge
of their collective seat.

24:36.913 --> 24:38.380
Will Mr. DeLaughter go after
Byron De La Beckwith?

24:38.582 --> 24:42.985
The D.A.'s office will investigate
the possibility of reopening the case.

24:43.186 --> 24:46.553
I didn't go to law school,
but that sounds like bullshit.

24:46.757 --> 24:47.815
Nice talking to you.

24:48.025 --> 24:49.515
Have a nice day.

25:11.081 --> 25:14.517
Can you tell me how I can get
ahold of Lewis Skinner...

25:14.718 --> 25:15.810
...or Fred Sanders?

25:16.019 --> 25:20.251
If you want Lewis Skinner, you'll need
a shovel and six hours of digging time.

25:20.657 --> 25:21.783
What's Fred's status?

25:21.992 --> 25:24.722
As far as I know,
he's still aboveground.

25:26.363 --> 25:28.888
Back in '63,
none of those houses were there.

25:29.099 --> 25:31.090
That was all vacant lot.

25:31.301 --> 25:34.236
And this here was
all covered over with brush.

25:34.471 --> 25:37.531
I got out here eight minutes
after the call came in.

25:37.741 --> 25:41.973
The way Mrs. Evers yelled at me,
you'd think I was the one who done it.

25:43.180 --> 25:47.412
This is where they found the gun,
hidden in some honeysuckle vines.

25:47.884 --> 25:49.943
Any idea where
that gun might be today?

25:50.153 --> 25:51.211
Hell, no.

25:51.421 --> 25:52.513
Back in those days...

25:52.723 --> 25:56.318
...evidence had a habit
of disappearing after the trials.

25:56.793 --> 25:57.919
Look at that.

25:58.128 --> 26:01.256
My grandmother could have
picked Evers off from over here.

26:01.465 --> 26:03.365
That's where he was shot.

26:03.567 --> 26:06.092
That big tree wasn't there
at the time.

26:06.436 --> 26:07.960
There was blood everywhere.

26:08.171 --> 26:11.072
All over the driveway,
all over the car.

26:11.274 --> 26:13.640
It was as if somebody
had butchered a hog.

26:13.877 --> 26:18.610
But Evers must've been one hell of a
strong man because somehow he managed...

26:18.815 --> 26:21.147
...to drag himself
all the way up to his door.

26:21.485 --> 26:25.478
After that bullet tore through his back,
it slammed through that window...

26:25.689 --> 26:27.156
...crashed through a wall...

26:27.357 --> 26:31.225
...ricocheted off the refrigerator
and busted the coffeepot.

26:31.428 --> 26:35.524
We found it on the kitchen counter
next to a watermelon.

26:36.867 --> 26:37.959
You're kidding me.

26:38.368 --> 26:39.596
No, sir.

26:44.574 --> 26:45.939
Did he have any kids?

26:46.143 --> 26:50.477
If my memory serves, I believe there
were three little ones there that night.

26:54.885 --> 26:59.447
What kind of man shoots another man
in the back in front of his family?

27:00.624 --> 27:03.149
I love the land of my birth.

27:03.927 --> 27:06.521
I do not mean
just America as a country...

27:06.763 --> 27:08.287
...but Mississippi...

27:08.498 --> 27:10.159
... the state in which I was born.

27:11.268 --> 27:14.294
So the deplorable things
I speak of here today...

27:14.538 --> 27:16.836
... will be said to you
in hopes of a future...

27:17.607 --> 27:20.838
... where such will not
be the case in Mississippi.

27:21.044 --> 27:22.807
In the horrific deaths...

27:23.013 --> 27:24.503
...of Emmett Till...

27:24.881 --> 27:27.076
...Reverend G. W. Lee...

27:27.450 --> 27:30.180
...Lamar Smith and a variety
of other atrocities...

27:30.387 --> 27:32.821
...no one has been convicted.

27:33.423 --> 27:38.190
And we feel those guilty of having
committed these ungodly acts...

27:38.395 --> 27:41.956
...had the feeling of assurance
that nothing ever would be done.

27:42.265 --> 27:44.529
For you see, ladies and gentlemen...

27:45.168 --> 27:49.400
... white juries have yet to convict
a white man in Mississippi...

27:49.673 --> 27:52.198
...guilty of a crime against a Negro.

27:52.976 --> 27:57.572
The failure of the so-called decent
or moderate white person...

27:57.781 --> 28:01.217
... to take a positive
and uncompromising stand....

28:01.418 --> 28:02.680
Who's that?

28:04.254 --> 28:05.619
Medgar Evers.

28:08.725 --> 28:10.352
Why are you looking at it?

28:12.495 --> 28:15.953
I just wanted to get
an idea of who he was.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.366
I'd like to get
an idea of who you are.

28:20.003 --> 28:21.732
What's that supposed to mean?

28:22.472 --> 28:24.940
I was willing to go down
that road with you...

28:25.141 --> 28:28.201
...when you got out of law school
and did that pro bono work.

28:28.411 --> 28:31.938
And when you worked for
that Jew lawyer who ran you ragged.

28:32.415 --> 28:36.215
I minded a little when you turned down
that offer from Morse & Braggs...

28:36.419 --> 28:39.286
...so you could be assistant D.A.
at one-fourth the salary.

28:39.489 --> 28:42.856
But I'll be damned if I spent
10 years supporting your career...

28:43.059 --> 28:44.458
...just so you can humiliate me.

28:45.061 --> 28:47.325
You're gonna pursue this, aren't you?

28:48.331 --> 28:51.391
You're gonna humiliate me
in front of my friends...

28:51.601 --> 28:53.694
...my family and the entire state.

28:53.904 --> 28:55.929
I'm just looking
at a couple of tapes.

28:56.539 --> 28:59.064
Fine. Look at your tapes.

28:59.376 --> 29:01.105
That's all you'd better do.

29:06.716 --> 29:08.274
-Why not?
-Because you can't win.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.315
Who says?

29:09.586 --> 29:12.419
-The Sixth Amendment.
-Suppose I could get around it.

29:12.622 --> 29:15.887
It's one thing for
the grieving widow to carry on--

29:16.293 --> 29:20.195
Suppose an argument could be made
that the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply.

29:20.397 --> 29:21.921
You want to retry Beckwith?

29:22.165 --> 29:23.097
Fine.

29:23.366 --> 29:28.167
Dig up 26-year-old physical evidence
which probably no longer exists...

29:28.605 --> 29:32.735
...identify it, and then you'll have
to locate the key witnesses...

29:32.943 --> 29:35.707
...who, if you find them,
are probably dead or senile.

29:35.912 --> 29:38.380
Their testimony could be read
from the transcript.

29:38.581 --> 29:42.278
We haven't seen a certified
transcript in over 25 years.

29:42.485 --> 29:45.010
-What if I found one?
-Let's say, by some miracle...

29:45.221 --> 29:48.782
...you found one, got an indictment.
Then by some greater miracle...

29:48.992 --> 29:53.156
...the state Supreme Court and U.S.
Supreme Court didn't throw it out...

29:53.363 --> 29:56.025
...and you actually got to trial.
What if you lose?

29:56.232 --> 30:00.168
The whole state, which is supposed
to have changed so much...

30:00.370 --> 30:03.066
...will be facing the worst
public relations disaster...

30:03.273 --> 30:06.538
...since that black kid, Emmett Till,
bobbed up out of the river.

30:12.182 --> 30:14.412
Are you telling me
I can't go after this?

30:14.617 --> 30:16.847
I'm telling you
you're dealing with the past.

30:17.053 --> 30:19.487
Mississippi's not
a place you wanna be.

30:24.194 --> 30:27.322
Hopefully, Jerry Mitchell can
keep this thing alive for us.

30:27.564 --> 30:30.761
Jerry Mitchell's fine, but
what we need is national press.

30:30.967 --> 30:35.529
Darrell, CNN won't run a major story
about how the D.A. of Hinds County...

30:35.739 --> 30:38.708
...is refusing to re-prosecute a case...

30:38.908 --> 30:40.899
...that's a quarter of a century old.

30:41.111 --> 30:43.671
Stop annoying your grandmama.

30:43.880 --> 30:48.078
The greatest joy in your mother's life
is being annoyed by her grandchildren.

30:48.284 --> 30:50.718
Next to being annoyed by you, Walter.

30:51.454 --> 30:52.421
I'll get it.

30:52.622 --> 30:54.681
I'm not here no matter who it is.

31:00.964 --> 31:01.988
Who?

31:03.900 --> 31:05.663
Just a minute, please.

31:06.503 --> 31:08.198
I want you to eat those beans.

31:08.405 --> 31:10.100
It's long distance from Jackson.

31:10.340 --> 31:13.241
A man by the name of DeLaughter.
You want me to take it?

31:13.443 --> 31:15.308
No, I'll take it.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.273
Eat those beans.

31:18.048 --> 31:19.948
I don't eat beans.

31:25.221 --> 31:26.381
Hello, Mrs. Evers.

31:26.589 --> 31:29.820
I know you probably left here
feeling pretty discouraged...

31:30.026 --> 31:33.393
...but I hope you understand
Mr. Peters was just being realistic.

31:33.596 --> 31:35.257
I understand perfectly.

31:35.465 --> 31:36.830
I also wanted you to know...

31:37.033 --> 31:39.866
...that we are going to
be keeping this case open.

31:42.806 --> 31:43.932
Mrs. Evers?

31:44.140 --> 31:47.303
Did it suddenly occur to
Mr. Peters that he'd better...

31:47.510 --> 31:51.446
...start making nice with the
black community before November?

31:52.015 --> 31:54.176
-Mrs. Evers--
-He made it clear to me...

31:54.417 --> 31:57.614
...that in addition to having
no evidence and no witnesses...

31:57.821 --> 31:59.482
...he also had no interest.

31:59.722 --> 32:03.954
Looking into this wasn't so much
Mr. Peter's idea as it was mine.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.321
-Yours?
-Yes, ma'am.

32:08.898 --> 32:12.493
Judge Russel Moore was perhaps
the most racist judge...

32:12.702 --> 32:14.966
...in the history
of the state of Mississippi.

32:15.171 --> 32:18.106
Why would his son-in-law
be interested in this case?

32:18.374 --> 32:22.140
Mrs. Evers, I'm 37 years old,
just like Medgar was...

32:22.345 --> 32:24.677
...and I've got three kids,
like he did.

32:25.081 --> 32:27.675
I was 11 years old
when your husband was killed...

32:27.884 --> 32:30.011
...and I hardly remember him at all.

32:31.020 --> 32:35.184
But I went by your house the other day
and I could see him there...

32:36.025 --> 32:37.856
...watering his lawn...

32:38.428 --> 32:40.191
... working on his roof...

32:40.997 --> 32:42.931
...playing with his children.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.593
No man has the right to take
another man away from his children.

32:49.372 --> 32:52.034
I appreciate the call,
Mr. DeLaughter.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.609
I'll keep in touch, Mrs. Evers.

33:00.216 --> 33:01.911
Did you plan on telling me...

33:02.452 --> 33:05.114
...or was I just gonna read
about it in the papers?

33:07.223 --> 33:10.056
We should be at the
Walkers' house in 15 minutes.

33:11.561 --> 33:14.291
Well, I've got a lot
of work to do here.

33:18.401 --> 33:19.766
Suit yourself.

33:24.874 --> 33:27.775
Nobody gives a goddamn
what Byron De La Beckwith did...

33:27.977 --> 33:30.241
...to some Medgar Evers 26 years ago.

33:30.446 --> 33:34.314
Hell, Larry Smith got shot down
in his own driveway just last week.

33:34.617 --> 33:36.380
And it wasn't for no civil rights.

33:36.586 --> 33:38.383
It was for his spare change.

33:38.588 --> 33:42.615
I could have had any investigator
I wanted, and I asked for you.

33:42.825 --> 33:44.793
Am I meant to be flattered by that?

33:44.994 --> 33:49.727
We're supposed to nail Eddie Williams
for killing Wendell Washington...

33:49.933 --> 33:52.766
...or that guy Pierson
for shooting Donny Brown.

33:52.969 --> 33:57.133
That's why we're only gonna work
on this case in our spare time.

34:15.824 --> 34:16.655
Holy shit.

34:17.827 --> 34:18.953
Will you look at this?

34:19.195 --> 34:23.723
You could buy a whole damn General
Electric refrigerator for $185.

34:26.168 --> 34:27.830
T alk about your good old days.

34:45.722 --> 34:46.780
That's my daddy.

34:49.092 --> 34:51.424
I didn't know he was on the force too.

34:51.661 --> 34:54.494
Sure. Detective L.C. Bennett.

34:54.998 --> 34:59.332
He was there when they found Beckwith's
rifle, but I've never seen this.

34:59.535 --> 35:01.230
John Goza is dead.

35:01.437 --> 35:02.961
Herbert Speight is dead.

35:03.406 --> 35:06.102
B.L. Pittman is dead.

35:06.342 --> 35:07.707
Is anybody alive?

35:07.944 --> 35:09.434
This is pointless.

35:12.215 --> 35:13.682
It's Jerry Mitchell.

35:15.518 --> 35:16.450
Jerry.

35:17.387 --> 35:19.014
I don't have the gun yet.

35:19.222 --> 35:23.158
I don't have anything. If I find
the gun, you'll be the first to know.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.828
-Pain in my ass.
-It's funny.

35:26.062 --> 35:29.088
I came by to see if you could
use some help on this case...

35:29.299 --> 35:31.529
...and you've got a picture of my daddy.

35:31.734 --> 35:33.497
We sure could use some help.

35:33.703 --> 35:35.796
Can you bring people
back from the dead?

35:36.806 --> 35:40.333
You're joking, but that's
exactly what we have to do.

35:40.543 --> 35:43.011
We have to make the past
start living again.

35:43.212 --> 35:45.407
This whole case is one big resurrection.

35:45.615 --> 35:48.015
I want you to go through
all the literature...

35:48.217 --> 35:50.515
...from every organization
Beckwith was part of:

35:50.720 --> 35:54.679
White Citizens Council,
Sons of the American Revolution, KKK.

35:54.924 --> 35:56.824
Good, I always loved homework.

35:57.026 --> 35:59.961
We'll start by paying
these boys a little visit.

36:00.163 --> 36:01.460
-Who's that?
-Two cops.

36:01.664 --> 36:05.430
They saw Beckwith 90 miles away
at the time of the murder.

36:05.668 --> 36:09.160
You think Holley and Cresswell
will admit they lied under oath?

36:09.839 --> 36:12.740
Time has a way of cleaning up
people's memories.

36:19.949 --> 36:22.008
I love the Delta.

36:22.251 --> 36:24.412
It's the best place on earth.

36:25.888 --> 36:27.185
If you're a mosquito.

36:32.295 --> 36:34.593
-T ake care now.
-Thank you, Mr. Holley.

36:36.265 --> 36:39.234
Sometimes you can't win for losing.

36:39.502 --> 36:42.369
I asked you boys
to meet me out here...

36:42.572 --> 36:46.804
...so as to avoid running
into any of my constituents.

36:47.777 --> 36:50.905
How long have you been
an alderman up here, Mr. Holley?

36:51.280 --> 36:53.646
Must be going on about five years.

36:54.050 --> 36:55.210
I'll tell you this:

36:55.418 --> 36:59.878
If word got out that I testified
on behalf of Byron De La Beckwith....

37:00.256 --> 37:03.783
I suppose, in a way, your boss
and me got the same problem.

37:03.993 --> 37:04.960
Sir?

37:05.228 --> 37:06.889
If we want to keep our jobs...

37:07.096 --> 37:09.894
...we'll have to kiss
an awful lot of black behind.

37:13.403 --> 37:14.802
Mr. Holley...

37:15.338 --> 37:19.468
...Evers was killed shortly after
midnight, 90 miles away in Jackson.

37:19.675 --> 37:22.007
There's no way the killer
could have been here...

37:22.245 --> 37:24.213
...at 1 a.m. pumping gas.

37:24.514 --> 37:27.108
No, sir, that'd be impossible.

37:27.316 --> 37:31.810
It was a long while ago, but I'd like
you to think back and tell me...

37:32.021 --> 37:33.818
...are you sure about the time...

37:34.023 --> 37:36.423
...you saw Mr. Beckwith
at that gas station?

37:36.826 --> 37:38.657
This old memory of mine...

37:38.861 --> 37:42.228
...gets worse and worse
with each passing year...

37:42.432 --> 37:45.060
...but there's two things
I am pretty sure about:

37:45.268 --> 37:47.896
It was approximately 1:03
in the morning...

37:48.104 --> 37:51.335
...and old Delay was gassing up
that Valiant of his.

37:53.276 --> 37:55.176
Lying son of a bitch.

37:55.445 --> 37:57.640
You thought you'd hear
something different?

37:57.847 --> 38:00.372
Maybe we'll have better luck
with his partner.

38:01.284 --> 38:03.149
Y'all wanna subpoena me...

38:03.352 --> 38:05.411
...then you go right ahead and do it.

38:05.688 --> 38:09.283
But if I see you,
Byron De La Beckwith...

38:09.492 --> 38:12.017
...or the blackest nigger
in this country...

38:12.228 --> 38:14.992
...putting gas in his car
at the time of a murder...

38:15.198 --> 38:17.029
...then that's what I'll say.

38:18.201 --> 38:20.066
I'd say he's in our camp.

38:28.544 --> 38:30.671
I wish I had better news
for her today.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.142
Who's that?

38:32.782 --> 38:34.044
Mrs. Evers.

38:34.550 --> 38:36.518
Fill it up for me, would you, buddy?

38:36.853 --> 38:40.619
I call her every Friday and let her
know how the case is progressing.

38:40.857 --> 38:43.724
Got a flash for you.
This case ain't progressing.

38:44.227 --> 38:47.719
I think about her keeping
this thing alive all this time.

38:48.464 --> 38:51.558
Imagine a woman loving a man so much.

38:54.003 --> 38:56.995
I can't even get a woman
to love me while I'm still alive.

38:57.206 --> 38:59.106
Know what I did after my last divorce?

38:59.342 --> 39:00.934
I took up golf.

39:01.143 --> 39:05.307
Man needs a hobby to occupy his mind,
or he'll start doing crazy things...

39:05.581 --> 39:07.242
...Iike drinking too much...

39:07.450 --> 39:11.352
...or chasing 26-year-old murder cases
across the Mississippi Delta.

39:19.695 --> 39:22.391
I told you I'd call you every Friday.

39:22.598 --> 39:25.795
And it's Friday, Mrs. Evers,
so I'm calling.

39:26.035 --> 39:28.799
This really isn't necessary.

39:29.038 --> 39:32.337
It's important to me you know
we're doing what we can.

39:32.542 --> 39:34.533
I wish I had better news
for you today...

39:34.744 --> 39:38.202
...but we still haven't been able
to locate the autopsy report.

39:38.414 --> 39:40.644
Most of the physical evidence
is still missing.

39:40.950 --> 39:44.249
A number of the witnesses have died,
which really hurts us...

39:44.453 --> 39:48.355
...and we've had no luck finding
the original trial transcript.

39:48.558 --> 39:51.527
I've just spoke with
both Holley and Cresswell...

39:51.727 --> 39:53.422
...and they're sticking
by their stories.

39:54.096 --> 39:58.965
I'm sure as the assistant
district attorney of Hinds County...

39:59.168 --> 40:01.432
...you're doing everything
in your power...

40:01.637 --> 40:03.628
...to see that justice is done.

40:09.478 --> 40:10.843
I'll call you next Friday.

40:11.247 --> 40:13.943
I'll be on pins and needles till then.

41:25.554 --> 41:27.545
I waited for you to come home.

41:30.593 --> 41:32.993
I'm not taking the children with me.

41:35.197 --> 41:38.166
I just need to be
on my own for a while.

41:55.484 --> 41:58.544
I was just wondering
when we stopped loving each other.

42:01.057 --> 42:02.354
I don't know.

42:06.696 --> 42:08.254
What happened, Bobby?

42:11.333 --> 42:12.925
People change.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.205
You saying I've changed?

42:19.008 --> 42:21.203
I'm saying you haven't.

42:37.460 --> 42:41.157
-It's a beautiful area, Mr. Beckwith.
-It's heaven on earth.

42:41.363 --> 42:43.593
Of course, like everywhere else...

42:43.933 --> 42:47.027
... we do get the occasional
stray nigger moving in.

42:47.570 --> 42:50.038
But their houses always
seem to burn down.

42:50.272 --> 42:53.730
You know how careless niggers are
with their cigarettes.

42:54.844 --> 42:56.835
A real beauty.

42:57.046 --> 43:00.174
-Where'd you get this?
-Ed Bryson at Channel 3.

43:00.382 --> 43:02.577
They're running a piece on Beckwith.

43:02.785 --> 43:03.752
Do you think...

43:03.986 --> 43:07.217
...it's a crime for a white man
to kill a black man?

43:07.423 --> 43:11.655
God put the white man here
to rule over all the dusky races.

43:11.861 --> 43:13.795
It says so in the Bible.

43:13.996 --> 43:15.429
Is there a chance...

43:15.664 --> 43:19.122
... you'd be indicted again
for the murder of Medgar Evers?

43:19.335 --> 43:23.237
Why would I be?
Do you know of any new evidence?

43:23.439 --> 43:24.599
-Are you a Jew?
-Catholic.

43:24.807 --> 43:27.071
I told you, I won't talk to no Jew.

43:27.276 --> 43:30.074
Anybody who knows anything
about Jews and niggers...

43:30.279 --> 43:33.373
...knows that Jews put the niggers
up to all this foolishness.

43:33.616 --> 43:37.916
This CORE and SNCC and NAACP.

43:38.187 --> 43:39.654
If you were indicted again?

43:40.055 --> 43:43.081
Well, I'm just gonna
tend to my business...

43:43.359 --> 43:44.917
...Iike I always have.

43:45.194 --> 43:48.652
I'm gonna look out
for my God, my family...

43:48.864 --> 43:51.264
...and the whole state
of Christ's church.

43:51.567 --> 43:54.331
That don't encompass anybody
but white Christians.

43:54.537 --> 43:56.164
All these other...

43:56.372 --> 43:59.535
...races and colors
and creeds and sissies...

43:59.742 --> 44:02.836
... they are anti-Christs.
See, many of them...

44:03.045 --> 44:06.173
...believe in human sacrifices
and voodoo and such.

44:06.382 --> 44:09.078
According to your way
of thinking...

44:09.318 --> 44:12.219
...how could justice be done
in the Medgar Evers murder?

44:14.123 --> 44:16.353
First, find out
who killed the nigger.

44:16.559 --> 44:18.186
Then you just...

44:18.460 --> 44:21.122
...do whatever the law says
that you can do...

44:21.330 --> 44:23.696
...if you're big enough to do it.

44:24.333 --> 44:26.392
He's daring us to get him.

44:27.102 --> 44:29.866
-We still ain't got nothing.
-I know what you'll say.

44:30.573 --> 44:32.973
-Did I kill Medgar Evers?
-Did you?

44:33.242 --> 44:34.869
I did not kill him.

44:35.878 --> 44:38.039
But he sure is dead.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.846
And he ain't coming back.

44:41.784 --> 44:44.344
What did you think when
you heard he'd been killed?

44:44.653 --> 44:46.621
I didn't shed a tear.

44:46.822 --> 44:47.846
No, sir.

44:52.695 --> 44:56.722
Here. The latest literary efforts
from the "Hate Group of the Month" Club.

44:57.266 --> 44:59.291
For people who got one thing
on their minds...

44:59.501 --> 45:02.197
...they got a lot of ways
to tell you about it.

45:03.772 --> 45:06.969
I wonder what old Judge Moore
would think about all this.

45:07.209 --> 45:09.370
Dixie still living with her mom?

45:11.146 --> 45:12.579
Shit, I'm late!

45:13.048 --> 45:15.039
Hot off the presses. Armed robbery.

45:15.384 --> 45:19.150
A guy named Spratlin held up
Crechelle's, got away with $3800...

45:19.421 --> 45:22.049
-...and an order of onion rings.
-I'll take care of it.

45:22.791 --> 45:23.758
Where you going?

45:23.959 --> 45:26.587
-I said I'd be home by 6.
-What about the Owens case?

45:26.896 --> 45:29.558
-The assault with the baseball bat.
-No, the carjacking.

45:29.765 --> 45:31.528
Right. I'm on top of it.

45:31.734 --> 45:34.294
You want this Evers thing
to be your life's work...

45:34.503 --> 45:36.437
...but there's cases that
occurred in this decade.

45:36.639 --> 45:37.731
I promise.

45:37.973 --> 45:40.840
This office can't keep covering
for you with the judges.

45:41.076 --> 45:43.738
-You'd best be in court tomorrow.
-I'll be there.

45:50.619 --> 45:51.745
Daddy...

45:52.254 --> 45:55.451
...how come Grandpa Russel
would be mad at you?

45:57.559 --> 46:01.086
Mommy said Grandpa Russel
would be mad at you.

46:01.730 --> 46:04.130
Great. What else did Mommy say?

46:04.366 --> 46:07.665
She said that you're doing something
that Grandpa won't like.

46:08.771 --> 46:10.170
Yeah, well....

46:11.407 --> 46:12.931
What are you doing?

46:22.851 --> 46:25.877
Grandpa Russel and I didn't
always agree on things.

46:26.255 --> 46:27.449
What things?

46:28.524 --> 46:31.652
Let's see, how can I explain this?

46:34.630 --> 46:35.961
Explain it.

46:36.899 --> 46:38.025
Right.

46:38.701 --> 46:42.034
You know how sometimes
people can just be different?

46:42.304 --> 46:43.498
Like how?

46:43.706 --> 46:45.799
Grandpa used to eat pig's knuckles.

46:46.775 --> 46:49.107
That's how I feel.
See, we're different.

46:49.311 --> 46:51.336
Grandpa used to like to build things.

46:51.547 --> 46:55.108
I can't build anything,
but I like to work in the garden.

46:55.351 --> 46:59.082
Grandpa had guns all over his house,
and we don't have any guns.

46:59.655 --> 47:00.644
I have a gun.

47:00.889 --> 47:03.323
Yours is a nuclear-powered laser gun.

47:03.525 --> 47:06.119
I'm talking about
handguns and rifles.

47:08.263 --> 47:09.195
Holy shit!

47:09.398 --> 47:10.456
Claire, watch Drew!

47:10.666 --> 47:11.758
Holy shit.

47:12.001 --> 47:13.525
Don't say that.
That's a bad word.

47:19.775 --> 47:20.799
Benny?

47:21.010 --> 47:25.140
Sanders said something about
evidence disappearing after trials.

47:25.347 --> 47:27.338
Do you know anything about that?

47:28.050 --> 47:31.110
My daddy told me that kind of thing
happened all the time.

47:31.320 --> 47:36.257
People used to take stuff as souvenirs.
You know, lawyers, bailiffs, clerks.

47:36.792 --> 47:38.589
How about judges?

47:39.995 --> 47:40.893
That's true.

47:41.130 --> 47:43.792
I'm afraid I won't
be able to play Tuesday.

47:43.999 --> 47:47.025
We have a round robin at the club,
and I promised Lou Ann.

47:49.538 --> 47:52.234
Honey, don't worry about it.
I'll call Charlynne.

47:52.441 --> 47:54.966
If she can't make it, I'll get Louise.

47:55.177 --> 47:59.876
Sugar, play that jack of clubs for me
there, if you would. Please, ma'am.

48:01.383 --> 48:03.044
Hi, Grandma.

48:03.285 --> 48:06.584
What are you doing here?
Dixie's not here.

48:06.789 --> 48:09.485
I thought you'd enjoy
a visit from your grandkids.

48:09.691 --> 48:14.094
Darlin', it's my bridge night tonight.
Drew! Come here.

48:14.296 --> 48:16.526
Well, we can't stay but a minute.

48:16.765 --> 48:20.531
Remember that rifle Judge Moore used
to hold open the door to his study?

48:20.736 --> 48:23.068
Have you seen that around anywhere?

48:23.439 --> 48:25.430
Ladies, y'all know Bobby.

48:25.641 --> 48:27.541
That's Marilyn and Jill and Leah.

48:27.776 --> 48:32.008
I won't keep you from your game.
Go ahead and I'll be right back.

48:32.247 --> 48:34.943
Now, what is he doing here, Caroline?

48:36.819 --> 48:38.252
He's looking for a gun.

48:45.828 --> 48:47.955
I don't appreciate
your roaming around.

48:48.163 --> 48:51.690
I want you coming down
those stairs now, and leave.

48:51.900 --> 48:56.701
I spent many a happy hour up here
arguing the law with your husband.

48:56.972 --> 49:00.203
And if he knew what you were up to
with this Evers nonsense...

49:00.409 --> 49:02.707
...that man would
turn over in his grave.

49:03.011 --> 49:05.104
I said that to myself just this morning.

49:06.014 --> 49:08.482
Dixie always said
that you were crazy as hell.

49:08.717 --> 49:10.241
Maybe she did have a point.

49:10.686 --> 49:11.778
I love you...

49:12.354 --> 49:15.152
...but you and Dixie aren't
any more right for each other...

49:15.357 --> 49:16.949
...than the man in the moon.

49:19.461 --> 49:21.622
I'll go back
and resume my bridge game.

49:23.198 --> 49:25.291
You go on ahead.
I'll be right down.

49:28.303 --> 49:31.431
It's best if you come on
back down with me right now.

49:31.640 --> 49:32.572
I prefer it.

49:39.615 --> 49:41.879
Be careful. It could be loaded.

49:42.084 --> 49:44.018
-Hold on to that.
-What are you doing?

49:44.219 --> 49:47.120
-Checking this serial number.
-I love my grandchildren.

49:47.322 --> 49:51.224
-A little bit higher.
-It's inappropriate to march in here...

49:51.493 --> 49:54.394
...and you expect me to just let you....

49:54.596 --> 49:55.585
What?

49:56.832 --> 49:58.891
I love you, Caroline.

49:59.835 --> 50:02.861
-You're full of shit.
-I logged it in the evidence locker.

50:03.071 --> 50:05.471
-Logged what in?
-The gun that killed Medgar Evers.

50:05.674 --> 50:07.301
-You're full of shit.
-Who?

50:07.509 --> 50:09.374
He says he found the gun.

50:09.845 --> 50:12.780
-You're full of shit.
-That's something to tell Mrs. Evers.

50:12.981 --> 50:15.575
I'm not gonna tell Mrs. Evers.

50:16.852 --> 50:19.980
You've been making those Friday calls
so she'd trust you.

50:20.189 --> 50:25.092
-lf she finds out....
-I can't have her find out.

50:25.294 --> 50:26.921
This can't leave the office.

50:27.496 --> 50:31.933
The only way we're gonna get a new
indictment is if we find something...

50:32.134 --> 50:34.898
...they didn't have 27 years ago.

50:35.103 --> 50:38.436
The way I see it, that something
will come from Beckwith.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.540
Right now,
he's on his mountaintop...

50:40.742 --> 50:43.734
...shooting his mouth off
to anyone who'll listen.

50:43.946 --> 50:47.313
No telling what incriminating thing's
liable to come out of that man.

50:47.649 --> 50:50.345
But if he knows we have
something like this...

50:50.552 --> 50:52.782
...he'll know we're serious
and clam up.

50:52.988 --> 50:56.014
I doubt that Beckwith and Myrlie
speak all that often.

50:56.291 --> 50:58.589
Myrlie speaks to Jerry Mitchell.

50:59.094 --> 51:01.619
Jerry Mitchell speaks to the world.

51:13.208 --> 51:15.938
"You best stop wasting
our taxpayers' money.

51:16.144 --> 51:18.078
Enjoy your drive home."

51:18.714 --> 51:22.150
Nice to see Jackson still
has some concerned citizens.

51:23.719 --> 51:27.086
Well, heck, son,
what did you expect?

51:27.589 --> 51:30.888
I expect people to act like
decent, law-abiding citizens.

51:31.093 --> 51:33.084
This is 1990, for crying out loud.

51:33.295 --> 51:37.959
Of course it is. And we got blacks
and whites playing ball together...

51:38.166 --> 51:42.262
...and on the police force,
in the government, on TV.

51:42.671 --> 51:46.903
We are a fully evolved society.
Aren't we, son?

51:49.911 --> 51:51.208
Let me tell you something:

51:51.647 --> 51:55.640
This country may be legally
integrated, but emotionally...

51:55.851 --> 51:58.376
...we will always be segregated.

51:58.587 --> 52:00.748
I don't know that I accept that.

52:01.256 --> 52:02.348
Of course not.

52:02.591 --> 52:04.286
You're Bobby DeLaughter...

52:04.493 --> 52:07.519
...Mississippi's self-appointed
new civil rights leader.

52:08.063 --> 52:09.052
Barney...

52:09.331 --> 52:11.128
...do we have to talk about this?

52:11.333 --> 52:13.528
No, we do not.

52:14.903 --> 52:17.895
Who all wants some of your
grandpa's famous baby backs?

52:18.106 --> 52:19.698
I do! I do!

52:30.552 --> 52:32.042
You're my son.

52:32.521 --> 52:34.148
I don't want you to get hurt.

52:37.059 --> 52:39.459
In Jackson, Mississippi

52:40.462 --> 52:43.898
In 1963

52:44.733 --> 52:47.930
There lived a man

52:48.136 --> 52:49.262
Who was brave

52:51.473 --> 52:55.466
He fought for freedom

52:56.478 --> 52:57.809
Hello, Mrs. Evers?

52:58.113 --> 52:59.341
It's Bobby DeLaughter.

53:00.115 --> 53:02.447
Nothing earth shattering, no.

53:02.784 --> 53:04.945
We've located all the witnesses...

53:05.153 --> 53:08.179
...but without the original
trial transcript...

53:08.390 --> 53:10.381
...it's tough piecing the case together.

53:11.893 --> 53:13.724
No, ma'am, that's about it.

53:14.629 --> 53:18.190
-I wish I had more to report.
-Hang up the phone.

53:18.433 --> 53:21.402
-Hang up the phone.
-I hope I'll have something...

53:21.603 --> 53:23.935
...a little more exciting next Friday.

53:24.773 --> 53:26.070
-You too.
-Hang up.

53:26.675 --> 53:29.109
I'll call you next Friday, Mrs. Evers.

53:30.045 --> 53:31.979
Thank you. Goodbye.

53:32.447 --> 53:33.607
What is going on?

53:33.849 --> 53:37.285
Would a confession by Mr. Beckwith
qualify as exciting?

53:38.120 --> 53:38.950
What do you got?

53:39.721 --> 53:40.745
You know Jack Ables?

53:40.956 --> 53:41.786
The lawyer?

53:41.990 --> 53:45.448
He's representing a movie studio
in a defamation of character suit...

53:45.660 --> 53:50.154
...brought by a couple Klansmen.
While he was doing his research...

53:50.365 --> 53:52.026
...he came across that.

53:53.535 --> 53:55.002
"Klandestine."

53:55.470 --> 53:57.097
It was written 20 years ago...

53:57.305 --> 54:01.002
...about this Klan titan turned
FBl informant, Delmar Dennis.

54:01.209 --> 54:06.146
On page 38, he talks about attending
a Klan rally in August of 1965.

54:06.481 --> 54:08.642
Guess who was a motivational speaker?

54:10.952 --> 54:12.442
-Beckwith?
-Our boy.

54:12.654 --> 54:13.882
Listen to this.

54:14.289 --> 54:15.756
And I quote:

54:16.158 --> 54:19.992
" Killing that nigger gave me no more
discomfort than our wives endure...

54:20.195 --> 54:22.186
...when they give birth
to our children."

54:22.597 --> 54:24.360
Sounds like a confession to me.

54:24.566 --> 54:28.832
Let's run down this Delmar Dennis.
We need to have a chat with him.

54:37.012 --> 54:39.606
$100 says old Delmar
chickens out on us.

54:39.915 --> 54:43.351
He's probably hiding in the woods,
shitting in his drawers.

54:51.827 --> 54:53.727
Where the hell is this place?

54:53.962 --> 54:55.827
This guy informed on the Klan.

54:56.064 --> 55:00.626
He could have made a deal with them
to save his butt by delivering us.

55:00.836 --> 55:02.599
That's a happy thought.

56:08.970 --> 56:10.938
One of you Bobby DeLaughter?

56:12.841 --> 56:16.072
Holding rallies and burning
crosses is one thing...

56:16.278 --> 56:19.577
...but when they killed them
three kids up in Neshoba County...

56:19.781 --> 56:22.079
-...freedom riders--
-Goodman, Chaney, Schwerner?

56:23.785 --> 56:26.515
That made a lot of people
come to their senses.

56:26.922 --> 56:30.551
That's why I decided
to go undercover for the FBl.

56:31.293 --> 56:34.592
I need to ask you if what
you say in that book happened.

56:34.796 --> 56:38.892
That part about Beckwith's speech
at that Klan rally. Is that a fact?

56:39.768 --> 56:40.962
It's a fact.

56:41.336 --> 56:44.601
I was shocked, and I remember
thinking how stupid he was...

56:44.806 --> 56:47.798
...shooting off his mouth
like that in front of 100 men.

56:48.043 --> 56:50.944
-Did you report that to the FBl?
-Sure, I did.

56:51.179 --> 56:54.376
But Beckwith was a white man
accused of killing a black.

56:54.583 --> 56:58.246
The FBl wasn't gonna blow my cover
on a case they couldn't win.

56:58.453 --> 57:00.444
They were saving me
for Neshoba because--

57:00.855 --> 57:02.413
Two of the victims were white.

57:09.664 --> 57:12.792
Mr. Dennis,
if I can't build the case...

57:13.001 --> 57:16.732
...I give you my word that
we never had this conversation.

57:17.739 --> 57:19.172
But if I can...

57:19.374 --> 57:20.932
...will you testify?

57:24.779 --> 57:27.043
Byron De La Beckwith
is the craziest...

57:27.248 --> 57:30.376
...most dangerous son of a bitch
I ever come across.

57:30.685 --> 57:33.279
He's so crazy even
the Klan's afraid of him.

57:33.521 --> 57:34.818
He's an old man now.

57:35.023 --> 57:39.460
That old man is probably more dangerous
today than he was 30 years ago.

57:40.428 --> 57:42.988
Mr. Dennis, we need your help.

57:43.932 --> 57:46.162
I can't make no promises.

57:50.305 --> 57:52.205
You know something, Mr. Dennis?

57:52.641 --> 57:54.165
Six months I've worked this case.

57:54.376 --> 57:56.936
A lot of people have told me
to give it up.

57:57.145 --> 58:00.410
" It's 27 years old.
Let sleeping dogs lie."

58:00.615 --> 58:03.049
But I don't see
what difference it makes...

58:03.251 --> 58:05.412
...if a man was
bushwhacked yesterday...

58:05.620 --> 58:08.521
...today or 27 damn years ago.

58:08.723 --> 58:10.384
Murder is murder.

58:11.126 --> 58:14.493
It's still my job to bring
the son of a bitch to justice.

58:14.696 --> 58:16.493
It's still your job to help me.

58:16.731 --> 58:20.098
No. I did my job.
I testified against the Klan.

58:20.301 --> 58:22.701
They shot out my windows,
blew up my car.

58:22.904 --> 58:25.668
They hunted and harassed me
for 25 years!

58:26.074 --> 58:28.201
Don't that get me even
for the wrong I done?

58:29.477 --> 58:32.139
We never get even
for the wrong we've done.

58:45.894 --> 58:47.794
If I do this thing...

58:50.231 --> 58:52.256
...you gotta promise me protection.

59:02.143 --> 59:03.337
What's going on?

59:04.579 --> 59:05.409
Stop that.

59:05.613 --> 59:06.978
Stop that. IKnock it off.

59:07.215 --> 59:08.045
Enough of that!

59:08.349 --> 59:10.817
-What's going on?
-Eddy called you a nigger lover.

59:11.019 --> 59:14.386
My dad says you're after a man
for something that isn't even a crime.

59:14.622 --> 59:17.955
That's enough fighting, son.
You get on home. Go on home.

59:18.159 --> 59:19.592
Let me take a look at you.

59:19.794 --> 59:23.491
My God. Get in this house.
What's gotten into you?

59:28.069 --> 59:30.697
All this fighting.
All this name-calling.

59:31.206 --> 59:32.503
Is this what you want?

59:32.741 --> 59:34.436
To drag your children into this?

59:34.676 --> 59:37.770
What would you have me do?
Let a murderer go free?

59:38.146 --> 59:41.377
I'd never tell you your business.
I'm thinking about the children.

59:41.583 --> 59:44.882
I don't understand why every
decent person in this state...

59:45.086 --> 59:48.283
...isn't sickened by what
happened here 27 years ago.

59:48.490 --> 59:50.754
-Oh, Bobby.
-You're not, are you?

59:50.959 --> 59:53.359
-Not in front of the children.
-Why not?

59:53.595 --> 59:55.028
I was just a kid...

59:55.230 --> 59:58.324
...and I still remember you
and your friends discussing it.

59:58.533 --> 01:00:02.025
And I recollect someone saying,
"That nigger needed to be shot."

01:00:03.304 --> 01:00:05.465
I never said a hateful
thing like that.

01:00:05.673 --> 01:00:09.404
-You didn't cry, did you?
-I can't say that I shed any tears--

01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:13.172
Had it been our beloved governor,
Ross Barnett, got himself shot...

01:00:13.381 --> 01:00:16.111
...you would've been
bawling your eyes out.

01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:20.515
Evers left a young widow and three
little kids. Why didn't you cry?

01:00:20.722 --> 01:00:22.849
-I don't wanna discuss this now.
-Why?

01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:25.548
Because he tried to destroy
our way of life.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.455
And he succeeded all too well.

01:00:27.662 --> 01:00:30.426
This state's going to hell
on account of integration.

01:00:30.632 --> 01:00:33.430
That's a fact. If you think
they appreciate one thing...

01:00:33.635 --> 01:00:35.432
...we gave them, you're crazy.

01:00:35.637 --> 01:00:38.128
-Tiger, how do you feel?
-I'm all right.

01:00:38.339 --> 01:00:41.831
-Your son has one tough nose.
-So it's not broken?

01:00:43.111 --> 01:00:46.205
It'll be tender for a couple days,
then it'll be good as new.

01:00:46.481 --> 01:00:48.176
Thank you. I appreciate it.

01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:49.782
You're welcome.

01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:51.917
Thank you, ma'am.

01:00:57.692 --> 01:01:00.092
Are you the one involved
in this Medgar Evers thing?

01:01:02.297 --> 01:01:03.730
Yes, I am.

01:01:04.265 --> 01:01:07.757
I think what you're trying to do
is very important.

01:01:11.873 --> 01:01:13.738
Thank you very much.

01:01:29.357 --> 01:01:31.882
I don't want you kids getting
into anymore fights.

01:01:32.093 --> 01:01:35.062
-But he called you a--
-I don't care what he called me.

01:01:35.263 --> 01:01:38.926
It doesn't bother me. You gotta
learn not to let it bother you.

01:01:39.133 --> 01:01:42.296
A lot of people around here
don't like what Daddy's doing now.

01:01:42.637 --> 01:01:44.264
What are you doing, Daddy?

01:01:45.807 --> 01:01:48.970
I'm trying to put a bad man in jail.

01:01:49.544 --> 01:01:51.478
Mama says what you're doing is wrong.

01:01:51.679 --> 01:01:54.944
Grandma said Edgar Mevers
is ruining our life.

01:01:59.854 --> 01:02:03.620
Medgar Evers was a good guy
who tried to help people.

01:02:03.825 --> 01:02:06.385
Did he try to beat the bad guys?

01:02:06.594 --> 01:02:10.223
Yes, he did. He fought
so that black people...

01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:13.457
...could eat in the same restaurants,
swim in the same pools...

01:02:13.668 --> 01:02:17.399
...shop in the same stores and go
to the same schools as white people.

01:02:17.605 --> 01:02:18.629
What's wrong with that?

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.932
Nothing.

01:02:21.075 --> 01:02:23.805
But you'll hear people say
all kinds of bad things...

01:02:24.012 --> 01:02:25.673
...about what your daddy's doing.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.815
They're gonna tease you,
try to pick fights.

01:02:29.183 --> 01:02:30.946
But no matter what they do...

01:02:31.519 --> 01:02:33.680
...I want you to walk away.

01:02:34.722 --> 01:02:36.781
What if they say
something really mean?

01:02:36.991 --> 01:02:40.586
They're only words. They can't
hurt you unless you let them.

01:02:40.795 --> 01:02:43.263
Is this about sticks and stones?

01:02:43.464 --> 01:02:46.126
That's exactly what this is about.

01:02:46.434 --> 01:02:48.163
Y'all understand what I'm saying?

01:02:48.369 --> 01:02:49.461
Yes, sir.

01:02:49.804 --> 01:02:50.964
All right.

01:02:51.272 --> 01:02:52.671
All y'all get on to bed now.

01:02:54.175 --> 01:02:55.369
Good night.

01:03:17.498 --> 01:03:21.025
I heard you had a little visit
with my friend Delmar.

01:03:21.235 --> 01:03:22.293
Mr. Beckwith?

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:26.231
Next time you see old Delmar,
you tell him for me...

01:03:26.507 --> 01:03:28.532
...there are a lot
of dark, winding roads...

01:03:28.743 --> 01:03:33.339
... between the backwoods of Louisiana
and a courtroom in Mississippi.

01:03:33.915 --> 01:03:36.509
A man could get lost.

01:03:46.294 --> 01:03:47.921
Claire, what's the matter?

01:03:48.463 --> 01:03:50.556
The ghost's in my room again.

01:03:54.435 --> 01:03:56.426
Let's see what we can do.

01:03:59.374 --> 01:04:01.604
-Where is he?
-Sitting right there.

01:04:01.809 --> 01:04:03.333
Oh, right.

01:04:05.046 --> 01:04:07.105
Daddy, sing "Dixie."

01:04:09.117 --> 01:04:10.880
Hop into bed, sweetie.

01:04:21.429 --> 01:04:22.521
Sing.

01:04:24.065 --> 01:04:27.694
You know, sweetie, maybe
" Dixie" is not the right song.

01:04:28.169 --> 01:04:30.535
Maybe that's why
this ghost keeps coming back.

01:04:30.738 --> 01:04:32.729
-But you said--
-I know, baby.

01:04:33.408 --> 01:04:36.775
But I'm not so sure
that all ghosts like "Dixie."

01:04:36.978 --> 01:04:39.742
But how do we know
what this ghost likes?

01:04:40.314 --> 01:04:44.774
Seeing as this is your special ghost,
maybe he'll like your favorite song.

01:04:44.986 --> 01:04:46.578
"Old MacDonald"?

01:04:46.788 --> 01:04:48.415
Let's give it a try.

01:04:50.425 --> 01:04:52.416
Old MacDonald had a farm

01:04:52.693 --> 01:04:54.251
E-I-E-I-O

01:04:54.462 --> 01:04:56.396
And on that farm he had a--

01:04:56.597 --> 01:04:57.495
What?

01:04:57.999 --> 01:04:59.159
A ghost?

01:05:01.169 --> 01:05:03.399
And on that farm he had a ghost

01:05:03.604 --> 01:05:05.094
E-I-E-I-O

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.408
With a boo boo here
And a boo boo there

01:05:07.608 --> 01:05:10.236
Here a boo, there a boo
Everywhere a boo boo

01:05:24.058 --> 01:05:25.582
You wanted to have lunch
to talk about Burt's nose?

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.588
No, actually, l....

01:05:27.795 --> 01:05:29.285
I didn't think so.

01:05:31.866 --> 01:05:33.697
So then, this is a date?

01:05:35.136 --> 01:05:36.262
Apparently.

01:05:36.704 --> 01:05:38.501
In the hospital cafeteria?

01:05:38.706 --> 01:05:43.143
I took a chance. I thought
it would either be stupid or charming.

01:05:43.845 --> 01:05:44.812
What do you think?

01:05:45.246 --> 01:05:46.838
Is there a third choice?

01:05:47.048 --> 01:05:47.980
Extremely charming?

01:05:48.182 --> 01:05:49.706
That's the one.

01:05:51.986 --> 01:05:53.715
How'd you get into all this?

01:05:54.155 --> 01:05:56.146
You want the standard answer
or the truth?

01:05:56.357 --> 01:05:57.881
How about a little of both?

01:05:59.894 --> 01:06:01.987
I always liked helping people...

01:06:02.196 --> 01:06:03.356
...and I like the hours.

01:06:03.631 --> 01:06:04.962
Which answer was that?

01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:06.531
A little of both.

01:06:06.767 --> 01:06:10.328
But I do like that I work
one week on and one week off.

01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:11.865
Can't beat that.

01:06:12.073 --> 01:06:15.270
Have to be careful not to shop
too much in that week off.

01:06:15.476 --> 01:06:18.070
That can kill you.
What about you?

01:06:18.746 --> 01:06:21.544
I wanted to be a lawyer
since I was a little kid.

01:06:21.749 --> 01:06:23.376
I watched Perry Mason...

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:26.519
...all the time.
I identified with him.

01:06:26.754 --> 01:06:29.222
-But he was a defense attorney.
-I know.

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:32.557
Later, I realized the only way
he ever won a case...

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.354
...is if some guy jumped up
and yelled, "I did it!"

01:06:35.563 --> 01:06:38.760
That didn't happen often,
so I switched to the other side.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.432
I think it's a good thing you did.

01:06:44.038 --> 01:06:46.472
You would be in
the minority these days.

01:06:47.742 --> 01:06:50.939
There are a lot more people
on your side than you think.

01:06:52.046 --> 01:06:55.106
You're not saying that because
I bought you a lime Jell-O?

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:58.784
Well, it is the way
to a woman's heart.

01:07:01.389 --> 01:07:05.826
But if you could pull this off,
it'd do Mississippi a whole lot of good.

01:07:07.562 --> 01:07:08.790
And if I don't?

01:07:10.398 --> 01:07:12.559
I'll pretend I never met you.

01:07:20.074 --> 01:07:23.009
I have renewed faith
in the institution of marriage.

01:07:23.211 --> 01:07:25.577
I can't get enough
of my hunk of burning love.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.748
Not now, Clara May!

01:07:30.418 --> 01:07:31.908
Clara Mayfield.

01:07:33.321 --> 01:07:35.915
-It's Jerry Mitchell.
-I'll take it.

01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:44.556
-I know you have the gun.
-We've been over this.

01:07:44.765 --> 01:07:47.063
I know you found it
in Russel Moore's den.

01:07:47.935 --> 01:07:52.395
There'll be a story about how the
D.A. Iied to the people of Jackson...

01:07:52.607 --> 01:07:55.303
...and how Bobby DeLaughter
lied to Myrlie Evers.

01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:58.034
I'm calling to see
if you care to comment.

01:07:58.246 --> 01:08:00.077
You've explained why
you lied to the press.

01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:02.806
You still have not explained
why you lied to me.

01:08:03.017 --> 01:08:05.577
I told you. Jerry Mitchell
is a loose cannon.

01:08:05.786 --> 01:08:08.755
This case was so delicate,
I didn't want to take chances.

01:08:08.956 --> 01:08:12.949
I'm the last person on earth who
would jeopardize this investigation.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.594
There's something
you're not telling me.

01:08:15.796 --> 01:08:18.662
I swear to God, there is no cover-up.

01:08:18.866 --> 01:08:21.926
You fully intend to seek
an indictment and a new trial?

01:08:22.136 --> 01:08:24.331
That's what we've
been working toward.

01:08:24.537 --> 01:08:26.631
I thought so, Mr. DeLaughter.

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.474
I thought so.

01:08:28.776 --> 01:08:32.337
This latest revelation only proves
what we've suspected all along.

01:08:32.546 --> 01:08:36.607
Peters and DeLaughter are just putting
on a show for the black community.

01:08:36.817 --> 01:08:40.844
As far as I'm concerned, they're nothing
but a pair of lying racists...

01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:42.682
...who never, I repeat, never...

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.859
...had any intention
of prosecuting this case.

01:08:47.895 --> 01:08:49.055
You wanted to see me?

01:08:49.263 --> 01:08:51.162
Come on, sit down.

01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:58.062
You don't mind being seen in
the same room with a "lying racist"?

01:08:58.872 --> 01:09:00.670
I don't mind if you don't.

01:09:02.343 --> 01:09:03.707
You know Pat Bennett?

01:09:04.245 --> 01:09:07.180
Sure, she's one of the best
lawyers in the state.

01:09:08.683 --> 01:09:10.207
Why are we talking about her?

01:09:11.519 --> 01:09:14.682
I thought she might be able
to help you on the case.

01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:17.853
I've got it under control, Ed.

01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:22.889
You have your share of
the 93 capital murder cases...

01:09:23.096 --> 01:09:25.429
...we have waiting for trial
under control?

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.497
What new excuse would
you suggest I give...

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:32.002
...to the families as to why those
who've murdered their loved ones...

01:09:32.206 --> 01:09:33.935
...have yet to see a courtroom?

01:09:34.608 --> 01:09:38.203
I'm just curious.
The fact that Pat Bennett is black...

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:41.073
...wouldn't have anything to do
with this, would it?

01:09:41.816 --> 01:09:43.977
I'm not gonna dignify that.

01:09:45.986 --> 01:09:49.478
Whatever you may think,
this is not the Bobby DeLaughter case.

01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:53.126
This is a case against the peace
and dignity of Mississippi.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.495
Monday morning, I'm making a change.

01:10:01.602 --> 01:10:05.003
You're about to hear the testimony
of a fingerprint expert...

01:10:05.206 --> 01:10:09.506
...concerning evidence he claims
to have identified in a certain glass.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.371
You're entitled to consider...

01:10:11.579 --> 01:10:15.413
... the prosecution's failure to make
the glass available to the defense.

01:10:15.616 --> 01:10:20.144
It is permissible that for one fact
alone to raise a doubt in your minds...

01:10:20.354 --> 01:10:22.754
... that will require
Mrs. Savage's acquittal.

01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:26.290
-Can he do that?
-This is my case, damn it.

01:10:26.494 --> 01:10:28.519
How dare they say
I'm putting on a show?

01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:32.096
Only two people care about
this case, and I'm one of them.

01:10:32.299 --> 01:10:36.065
If anybody's putting on a show,
they are. The only thing they' re--

01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:40.264
They're only trying to stir up
emotions and position themselves...

01:10:40.474 --> 01:10:42.908
...as the saviors
of the black community.

01:10:51.018 --> 01:10:52.178
Where you going?

01:11:11.372 --> 01:11:14.170
This is Bobby DeLaughter.
I hope I didn't disturb you.

01:11:15.843 --> 01:11:17.936
This won't take but a minute, ma'am.

01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:21.576
When I started off,
I had nothing more than...

01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:24.774
...a couple of pages
in an old police report.

01:11:25.553 --> 01:11:28.716
I spent the better part of a year
bumping up against dead witnesses...

01:11:28.923 --> 01:11:30.914
...and tracking down live ones.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:34.458
My car's been vandalized,
my son's been in a fight...

01:11:34.662 --> 01:11:38.257
...and I've been called ugly things
by every racist in Mississippi.

01:11:38.466 --> 01:11:40.559
Now, when there's a chance
for an indictment...

01:11:40.768 --> 01:11:42.929
...I've gotta fight off
black politicians too.

01:11:43.137 --> 01:11:47.267
I'm sorry I lied about the gun,
but I've made a commitment to this case.

01:11:47.475 --> 01:11:48.669
I'll be goddamned--

01:11:48.876 --> 01:11:51.709
Pardon me, if I give it up
to some special prosecutor...

01:11:51.912 --> 01:11:54.312
...I don't care if he's
black, green or blue.

01:11:54.515 --> 01:11:57.575
I'm committed and I'm asking you
to make a commitment to me.

01:11:57.785 --> 01:12:00.515
If you do, I'll ride this thing
to the finish line...

01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:02.985
...or collapse
heading in that direction.

01:12:04.558 --> 01:12:07.186
Thank you for your call,
Mr. DeLaughter.

01:12:11.632 --> 01:12:14.032
The hell with her!
She's like all the rest.

01:12:14.235 --> 01:12:18.365
The white world hasn't gone out
of its way to make her trusting.

01:12:18.572 --> 01:12:20.437
When does it start?
What do I have to do?

01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:23.633
We had a real chance to send
a message to this country...

01:12:23.844 --> 01:12:26.813
...that Mississippi isn't
a bunch of redneck racists.

01:12:27.014 --> 01:12:31.110
My mother was right. We should
separate and let the South rise again.

01:12:31.318 --> 01:12:33.445
-You don't believe that.
-Why not?

01:12:33.654 --> 01:12:35.144
She doesn't want my help.

01:12:35.356 --> 01:12:37.790
I'm just another white man
putting her in her place.

01:12:37.992 --> 01:12:40.483
She sees no difference
between me and Beckwith.

01:12:40.694 --> 01:12:42.594
-You didn't tell her about the gun.
-Right.

01:12:42.863 --> 01:12:46.890
If I had it to do over again,
I still wouldn't have told her.

01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:51.060
IKeeping the discovery of the murder
weapon a secret was a good strategy.

01:12:51.272 --> 01:12:55.402
It wouldn't bother her a lick if I was
black. I'd just be a smart lawyer.

01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:58.238
You can't have it both ways.

01:12:58.579 --> 01:13:00.308
What do you mean by that?

01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:04.578
You said the reason you didn't
tell her about the gun...

01:13:04.785 --> 01:13:07.413
...was that you were afraid
she would leak the story.

01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:10.715
You can't expect her to trust you,
if you don't trust her.

01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:32.140
I want you to meet with Pat Bennett
and bring her up to speed.

01:13:33.948 --> 01:13:34.972
Fine.

01:13:36.317 --> 01:13:37.750
It's for the best.

01:13:38.886 --> 01:13:40.478
If you say so.

01:14:03.477 --> 01:14:05.468
I'm going out.
You want something?

01:14:05.679 --> 01:14:09.410
I'd like a Mercedes convertible,
but I'd settle for a Dr. Pepper.

01:15:04.938 --> 01:15:08.339
There are four important
things in my life:

01:15:09.243 --> 01:15:11.370
Medgar, Walter...

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:13.044
...my children...

01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:14.746
...and this...

01:15:15.382 --> 01:15:18.681
...the original
court-certified transcript.

01:15:19.253 --> 01:15:21.813
I've kept this for 27 years...

01:15:22.122 --> 01:15:24.386
...through three district attorneys.

01:15:24.591 --> 01:15:26.491
Once I give this up...

01:15:26.694 --> 01:15:29.561
...I know that it may be gone forever.

01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:41.766
I don't believe you'll find
anymore opposition...

01:15:41.975 --> 01:15:44.466
...to your continuing
to handle this case.

01:15:45.779 --> 01:15:47.041
Thank you, ma'am.

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:52.043
It's truly appreciated.

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.284
Let's get the son of a bitch.

01:15:56.557 --> 01:15:57.956
My pleasure.

01:16:00.094 --> 01:16:02.187
The decision by the D.A.'s office...

01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:06.355
...to re-open the 27-year-old murder
case of Byron De La Beckwith...

01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:08.228
...continues to cause controversy.

01:16:08.569 --> 01:16:11.504
Citizens of Jackson are concerned...

01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:15.004
... that taxpayers' money is being
used to dig up the past.

01:16:15.209 --> 01:16:18.940
The grand jury handed down an
indictment of Byron De La Beckwith...

01:16:19.146 --> 01:16:22.138
...in the murder of
civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

01:16:22.349 --> 01:16:23.873
Extradition in the Beckwith case...

01:16:24.084 --> 01:16:27.315
...is seen as a stumbling
block for the D.A.'s office.

01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:29.887
I plan to fight repossession--
What's the word?

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:33.253
Extradition tooth, nail and claw!

01:16:33.794 --> 01:16:36.786
In an attempt to replace
a lost autopsy report...

01:16:36.997 --> 01:16:40.763
... the D.A.'s office of Hinds County
today received permission...

01:16:40.968 --> 01:16:43.061
...by the Evers family
to exhume the body...

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:46.706
...of slain civil rights leader
Medgar Evers.

01:16:47.374 --> 01:16:50.901
The body, buried in
Arlington National Cemetery in 1963...

01:16:51.111 --> 01:16:53.773
... was found in remarkably
near-perfect condition.

01:16:57.885 --> 01:17:00.911
After 18 months, extradition was
finally granted...

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:03.089
...in the case
of Byron De La Beckwith...

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:07.158
... the man accused of slaying
civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

01:17:08.228 --> 01:17:12.756
Beckwith will face murder charges
30 years after the initial two trials...

01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:16.094
...for the same offense
ended in hung juries.

01:17:16.303 --> 01:17:17.167
Thank you, son.

01:17:17.471 --> 01:17:19.166
" I first received the call...

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:21.307
...at 9 :42 p. m...

01:17:21.508 --> 01:17:25.205
...on the night of June 12, 1963.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.608
My partner and I responded
and proceeded to the crime scene...

01:17:29.817 --> 01:17:33.150
...Iocated at 2332 Guynes Street."

01:17:33.487 --> 01:17:35.148
That's pretty good, Benny...

01:17:35.355 --> 01:17:38.290
...but just because you read
the part of a dead witness...

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:41.393
...doesn't mean you have to
act like you're actually dead.

01:17:41.595 --> 01:17:42.994
I'm doing my best.

01:17:43.197 --> 01:17:44.664
I know you are.

01:17:44.865 --> 01:17:47.356
Medgar Evers' autopsy report
just came in.

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:51.334
You're not gonna believe this.
He's still dead.

01:17:51.805 --> 01:17:52.999
Thank you, Clara.

01:17:53.207 --> 01:17:56.665
I got off the phone with Charles Evers.
He won't come to the trial.

01:17:56.877 --> 01:17:57.707
Did he say why?

01:17:57.911 --> 01:17:59.173
He wouldn't say.

01:17:59.379 --> 01:18:01.677
Get me the address
of his radio station.

01:18:01.882 --> 01:18:04.043
They found a bullet fragment
in the body.

01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:06.776
It's consistent with a.30-06 Enfield.

01:18:07.754 --> 01:18:11.690
You'll be sorry. What happened to
that nigger will happen to you.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:13.890
Another one?

01:18:15.729 --> 01:18:19.756
Closer we get to trial, the more
nutjobs will crawl out of the woodwork.

01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:21.866
You got a gun?

01:18:23.403 --> 01:18:25.030
Here. T ake this.

01:18:25.572 --> 01:18:27.437
No, wait. T ake this.

01:18:29.076 --> 01:18:30.668
T ake this.

01:18:55.002 --> 01:18:58.438
That was Muddy Waters doing
his thing for y'all.

01:18:58.639 --> 01:19:01.631
Now I'll play a little something
that goes way back.

01:19:01.842 --> 01:19:04.811
The great Robert Johnson.

01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:10.307
Mr. Evers?

01:19:13.687 --> 01:19:16.155
-Hi, I'm--
-Bobby DeLaughter.

01:19:17.591 --> 01:19:19.320
Please sit down.

01:19:29.169 --> 01:19:30.500
Robert Johnson.

01:19:31.004 --> 01:19:33.234
IKing of the Delta Blues.

01:19:36.076 --> 01:19:38.408
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:19:40.981 --> 01:19:43.108
May your soul rise up to heaven...

01:19:43.317 --> 01:19:45.785
...'fore the devil knows you're dead.

01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:56.991
They say Robert Johnson sold his soul to
the devil to play the guitar like that.

01:19:57.397 --> 01:19:58.295
What do you think?

01:19:58.498 --> 01:20:02.798
If the devil wanted my soul, it'd cost
a lot more than some guitar lessons.

01:20:06.039 --> 01:20:08.530
I believe after this trial's over...

01:20:08.742 --> 01:20:11.176
...Mississippi come through this time.

01:20:11.478 --> 01:20:14.345
That's why I came here
to talk with you, Mr. Evers.

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:18.416
Would you change your mind and come
to the trial? Your presence...

01:20:18.618 --> 01:20:20.552
...would mean a great deal.

01:20:22.389 --> 01:20:24.789
Let me tell you something.

01:20:26.059 --> 01:20:28.550
Medgar was my baby brother.

01:20:29.196 --> 01:20:31.960
There ain't nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

01:20:33.033 --> 01:20:34.762
When we were little kids...

01:20:34.968 --> 01:20:36.731
...we used to sleep in the same bed.

01:20:36.937 --> 01:20:38.336
And on cold nights...

01:20:38.538 --> 01:20:42.167
...I'd climb in first just so I could
warm up the sheets for him.

01:20:44.745 --> 01:20:48.078
I didn't go to the first two trials.

01:20:49.383 --> 01:20:50.907
Myrlie...

01:20:51.585 --> 01:20:54.986
...a lot of people,
they criticized me for that.

01:20:55.789 --> 01:20:58.417
But I won't go
to no third trial neither...

01:20:59.459 --> 01:21:02.053
...and for the exact same reason.

01:21:02.262 --> 01:21:06.289
I know if I ever got in the same room
with Byron De La Beckwith...

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.934
...as God is my witness...

01:21:09.269 --> 01:21:12.761
...I'd wrap my hands around
his chicken neck and snap it in half.

01:21:12.973 --> 01:21:14.702
And nobody...

01:21:14.908 --> 01:21:16.842
...be able to stop me.

01:21:18.512 --> 01:21:20.139
I wouldn't blame you.

01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:21.575
Nobody hardly ever...

01:21:21.782 --> 01:21:24.182
...remembers Medgar anymore.

01:21:25.152 --> 01:21:27.017
Whites or blacks.

01:21:27.687 --> 01:21:30.019
And that's a goddamn shame.

01:21:30.757 --> 01:21:33.590
Because whatever rights
the black man has now...

01:21:33.794 --> 01:21:37.127
...he's got because of something
called the Civil Rights Movement.

01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:40.458
And for a long time here
in the state of Mississippi...

01:21:40.967 --> 01:21:44.767
...before the television, newspapers,
back before the fancy speeches...

01:21:44.971 --> 01:21:48.964
...my brother, Medgar, was
the Civil Rights Movement.

01:21:54.614 --> 01:21:59.108
I'm sitting here tonight,
talking to my friend and your friend...

01:21:59.319 --> 01:22:01.981
...Assistant District Attorney
Bobby DeLaughter.

01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:05.317
We're talking about my brother,
Medgar Evers...

01:22:05.525 --> 01:22:10.326
...and we're gonna play the blues
for Medgar all night long.

01:22:20.841 --> 01:22:23.002
You and my sister-in-law...

01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:26.045
...you get justice for my brother.

01:22:35.822 --> 01:22:38.017
Devil, if you listening...

01:22:38.258 --> 01:22:40.556
...I won't sell my soul
for no guitar lessons...

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.194
...but I'll sell my soul for that.

01:22:47.834 --> 01:22:49.699
Are you surprised bail
was granted so quickly?

01:22:49.903 --> 01:22:52.701
Mr. Beckwith was being held
as a political prisoner.

01:22:52.906 --> 01:22:56.069
He's not been found guilty.
Why should he be kept in jail?

01:22:57.444 --> 01:22:59.935
Mr. Scott, you're an officer
of the Nationalist Movement, correct?

01:23:00.147 --> 01:23:02.479
Is that where the money came from
to secure his bond?

01:23:02.682 --> 01:23:06.914
Mr. Beckwith has a lot of friends here.
We'll do whatever it takes.

01:23:07.387 --> 01:23:11.619
Suppose he doesn't show for the trial?
Suppose he leaves the country?

01:23:11.825 --> 01:23:13.884
If he runs, we'll find him.

01:23:14.094 --> 01:23:15.823
How long will that take?

01:23:16.029 --> 01:23:18.827
Another five years? Another 10?

01:23:19.032 --> 01:23:23.059
I've already devoted a lifetime to this.
That ought to be enough.

01:23:24.037 --> 01:23:26.562
Yes, ma'am. It sure ought to be.

01:23:31.511 --> 01:23:33.138
I'm sorry, Bobby.

01:23:34.247 --> 01:23:36.238
It's all right, Mrs. Evers.

01:23:36.449 --> 01:23:37.939
It's quite all right.

01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:07.571
-How's Jared doing?
-Fine.

01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:11.046
He and Burt seem like
they've been brothers all their lives.

01:24:11.251 --> 01:24:12.775
They all sleeping?

01:24:14.454 --> 01:24:16.684
And that's what you should be doing.

01:24:17.524 --> 01:24:19.719
I want the opening statement
to be great.

01:24:20.493 --> 01:24:22.893
It was great when you read
it three nights ago.

01:24:23.096 --> 01:24:25.030
Unless you snuck in something about...

01:24:25.232 --> 01:24:27.325
...Beckwith deserving
the Nobel Peace Prize...

01:24:27.534 --> 01:24:29.764
...I'm sure it'll be great
tomorrow morning.

01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:32.495
You see? That's why I look to you.

01:24:32.706 --> 01:24:36.164
Eliminate Nobel Peace Prize reference.

01:24:36.376 --> 01:24:37.843
That's good.

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.446
I left a gift for you in appreciation
for everything you're doing...

01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:46.516
... to ruin civilized society.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.951
-What the hell is this?
-It's scheduled to go off at 10 p.m.

01:24:50.156 --> 01:24:52.147
You have a nice night.

01:24:56.663 --> 01:24:57.493
It's a bomb.

01:25:02.502 --> 01:25:04.299
Everybody, get up.
Let's go.

01:25:04.504 --> 01:25:05.869
What's going on?

01:25:06.072 --> 01:25:09.974
It's nothing at all. Outside that door.
A little drill is all.

01:25:10.176 --> 01:25:11.768
Head for the front door.

01:25:45.912 --> 01:25:48.073
Is this still the drill?

01:26:01.194 --> 01:26:02.752
Where are we going, Dad?

01:26:02.962 --> 01:26:05.089
Told you we're going
to the Holiday Inn.

01:26:05.298 --> 01:26:07.732
Is that where we're going?
The Holiday Inn?

01:26:07.934 --> 01:26:08.832
That's right.

01:26:09.035 --> 01:26:13.369
We haven't found anything,
but we'll go through it one more time.

01:26:13.573 --> 01:26:15.404
I appreciate that.

01:26:35.662 --> 01:26:40.258
I told them if anything ever happened,
all they had to do was walk away.

01:26:42.435 --> 01:26:45.598
How're they supposed to walk away
from a bomb?

01:26:50.577 --> 01:26:52.511
There wasn't a bomb.

01:26:55.048 --> 01:26:56.515
This time.

01:27:00.053 --> 01:27:02.920
If you want to give this thing up,
I understand.

01:27:03.123 --> 01:27:06.650
No one could fault you. But the world
isn't going to be any safer.

01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:09.727
I don't give a shit about the world.
These are my children.

01:27:09.929 --> 01:27:11.260
Yes, they are.

01:27:11.464 --> 01:27:13.955
Someday they'll be able
to tell their children...

01:27:14.167 --> 01:27:16.897
...that their daddy put away
Medgar Evers' killer.

01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:20.405
Medgar Evers was a fool,
and my daddy was right.

01:27:20.607 --> 01:27:22.905
Doesn't matter how many
civil rights laws you pass.

01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:25.407
You'll never legislate
how people think.

01:27:25.612 --> 01:27:28.274
There are always gonna be
a few misguided people.

01:27:28.481 --> 01:27:32.577
I'm not talking about a few people.
I'm talking about everybody, about us.

01:27:32.786 --> 01:27:35.254
Do we have one single
black friend? No.

01:27:35.455 --> 01:27:37.923
We don't have dinner with them
or have them over.

01:27:38.124 --> 01:27:39.751
We don't sit with them in church.

01:27:39.959 --> 01:27:42.757
You think this one trial will
magically change this?

01:27:42.996 --> 01:27:44.657
No, I don't.

01:27:45.131 --> 01:27:46.655
It's a step.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.425
That's all anyone can do
is take a step.

01:27:49.636 --> 01:27:51.763
Why do I have to take that step?

01:27:51.971 --> 01:27:54.906
So some sick son of a bitch
can murder my wife and kids?

01:27:55.108 --> 01:27:57.770
Excuse me if I'm not interested
in taking that step.

01:27:57.977 --> 01:27:59.171
Where are you going?

01:27:59.379 --> 01:28:01.142
For a drive.

01:30:13.413 --> 01:30:17.782
" I don't know if I'm going to heaven
or hell, but I'm going from Jackson."

01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:25.484
We're on record in the matter
of Mississippi v. Byron De La Beckwith.

01:30:25.692 --> 01:30:27.819
Does prosecution have
its opening statement?

01:30:29.329 --> 01:30:30.296
We do, Your Honor.

01:30:36.536 --> 01:30:38.401
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:41.096
...this is a very simple case.

01:30:43.076 --> 01:30:45.738
It's about a man whose life
was snuffed out...

01:30:45.945 --> 01:30:49.312
...on June the 12th of 1963...

01:30:49.916 --> 01:30:52.646
...by a bullet that tore
through his body.

01:30:53.286 --> 01:30:56.221
A bullet aimed out of prejudice...

01:30:56.422 --> 01:30:58.287
...propelled by hatred...

01:30:58.491 --> 01:31:01.927
...and fired by
a back-shooting coward...

01:31:03.062 --> 01:31:04.757
...from ambush...

01:31:05.898 --> 01:31:06.990
...at night.

01:31:07.533 --> 01:31:12.368
The evidence will overwhelmingly show
that Byron De La Beckwith...

01:31:12.839 --> 01:31:16.275
...a self-proclaimed, rabid racist
on a lifelong mission...

01:31:16.476 --> 01:31:19.274
...to purge society
of anyone and anything...

01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:21.106
...that stood for integration...

01:31:21.314 --> 01:31:23.839
...is the man that fired that bullet.

01:31:24.417 --> 01:31:27.682
Evidence will show how, when he
thought he beat the system...

01:31:27.887 --> 01:31:30.481
...he bragged about what he'd done.

01:31:31.524 --> 01:31:34.891
Bragged about getting
away with murder.

01:31:36.963 --> 01:31:41.093
The evidence will undeniably show that
the person who pulled the trigger...

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:45.327
...and ended the life of Medgar Evers
is this defendant...

01:31:46.172 --> 01:31:48.231
...Byron De La Beckwith.

01:31:52.745 --> 01:31:54.212
Mr. Coxwell?

01:31:55.248 --> 01:31:56.840
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:57.283 --> 01:32:01.014
My name is Merrida Coxwell.
This is James Kitchens...

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.451
...and we are representing
Mr. Beckwith.

01:32:05.058 --> 01:32:07.788
Mr. DeLaughter started
his opening statement...

01:32:07.994 --> 01:32:10.963
...by saying that this was
a very simple case.

01:32:11.164 --> 01:32:12.631
I agree with him.

01:32:12.899 --> 01:32:16.892
But what Mr. DeLaughter is going
to rely on is for you...

01:32:17.103 --> 01:32:21.699
...to convict Mr. Beckwith
simply because of his opinions.

01:32:22.308 --> 01:32:23.468
That's because...

01:32:23.676 --> 01:32:28.136
...he knows that the state cannot prove
to you beyond a reasonable doubt...

01:32:28.347 --> 01:32:30.907
...that the defendant committed
the crime.

01:32:31.117 --> 01:32:33.449
By the time this trial is over...

01:32:33.653 --> 01:32:37.316
...you will have seen it was
physically impossible...

01:32:37.523 --> 01:32:40.617
...for Mr. Byron De La Beckwith
to have killed Medgar Evers.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.360
Mr. Beckwith is not guilty.

01:32:43.563 --> 01:32:45.895
That's what the proof will show.

01:32:46.499 --> 01:32:47.727
Thank you.

01:32:49.635 --> 01:32:51.626
The state may call its first witness.

01:32:52.905 --> 01:32:55.396
The state calls Myrlie Evers.

01:33:08.387 --> 01:33:09.752
Raise your right hand.

01:33:09.956 --> 01:33:11.981
Do you swear to tell the truth...

01:33:12.191 --> 01:33:14.955
-...the whole truth, so help you God?
-I do.

01:33:15.228 --> 01:33:16.525
Be seated.

01:33:22.769 --> 01:33:24.532
Will you tell us your name?

01:33:25.104 --> 01:33:27.197
My name is Myrlie Evers.

01:33:27.406 --> 01:33:30.500
Going back to 1963,
were you married at that time?

01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:32.143
Yes, I was.

01:33:32.345 --> 01:33:34.176
And to whom were you married?

01:33:36.916 --> 01:33:38.781
Medgar Wylie...

01:33:38.985 --> 01:33:40.475
...Evers.

01:33:46.793 --> 01:33:49.785
When was the last time
you saw your husband alive?

01:33:50.663 --> 01:33:53.359
June 11, 1963.

01:33:55.034 --> 01:33:57.093
I'd fallen behind...

01:33:57.303 --> 01:34:00.466
...in my housework
and got up early that morning...

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:03.231
...to iron some shirts for Medgar.

01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:06.100
By the time he woke...

01:34:06.312 --> 01:34:10.646
...I had 10 freshly ironed shirts
neatly hung on hangers.

01:34:12.185 --> 01:34:15.450
He said, "I thank you
for ironing these shirts...

01:34:15.655 --> 01:34:17.418
...but I'm not going to need them."

01:34:18.858 --> 01:34:22.851
Before he left for work that morning,
he kissed us all goodbye...

01:34:23.262 --> 01:34:25.162
...and then left.

01:34:26.532 --> 01:34:28.124
But then he came back...

01:34:28.334 --> 01:34:30.427
...and took me aside.

01:34:30.837 --> 01:34:33.328
He said, "If anything
should happen to me...

01:34:33.539 --> 01:34:35.598
...I want you to promise me...

01:34:35.808 --> 01:34:38.504
...you will take care of my babies."

01:34:39.445 --> 01:34:42.812
I said, "Of course.
They're my babies too."

01:34:45.251 --> 01:34:48.846
He then kissed us all
goodbye again and left.

01:34:51.858 --> 01:34:54.258
Could you tell the jury
what you remember...

01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:58.419
...seeing and hearing when your husband
returned home that night?

01:34:59.098 --> 01:35:02.625
It was just after midnight
when he got home.

01:35:03.469 --> 01:35:05.300
We heard the car.

01:35:13.746 --> 01:35:16.214
And then there was...

01:35:20.553 --> 01:35:23.147
...this horrible blast.

01:35:25.691 --> 01:35:27.318
The children...

01:35:28.027 --> 01:35:31.258
...fell to the floor
as their father had taught them.

01:35:32.265 --> 01:35:34.825
I bolted to the front door.

01:35:36.202 --> 01:35:39.069
Medgar was lying in the carport.

01:35:40.306 --> 01:35:42.831
He still had his keys in his hand.

01:35:45.044 --> 01:35:47.410
Blood everywhere.

01:35:49.148 --> 01:35:51.776
The children came out
shortly after I did...

01:35:51.984 --> 01:35:53.849
...and they were screaming...

01:35:54.854 --> 01:35:56.014
... "Daddy!

01:35:57.056 --> 01:35:58.580
Daddy, get up!

01:36:00.393 --> 01:36:02.361
Daddy, please get up."

01:36:05.965 --> 01:36:08.866
But I knew he would
never get up again.

01:36:13.873 --> 01:36:15.773
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:36:17.877 --> 01:36:22.940
Mr. McIntyre, have you ever owned
a 1917 Enfield.30-06 rifle?

01:36:23.749 --> 01:36:24.943
Yes, I have.

01:36:25.151 --> 01:36:27.881
Did you own that rifle in 1963?

01:36:28.821 --> 01:36:33.622
Sometime, I believe in 1960,
I traded it to Mr. Beckwith.

01:36:33.893 --> 01:36:37.954
Mr. McIntyre, I want to show you
this firearm and ask if you would...

01:36:38.164 --> 01:36:41.395
...read the serial number
on the barrel, please.

01:36:42.101 --> 01:36:46.037
1-0-5-2-6-8-2.

01:36:46.238 --> 01:36:50.299
Thank you. Going back to exhibit 35,
would you read the serial number...

01:36:50.509 --> 01:36:52.977
...on the invoice of the gun
that you purchased...

01:36:53.179 --> 01:36:55.238
...and later traded to Mr. Beckwith?

01:36:55.448 --> 01:36:59.111
1-0-5-2-6-8-2.

01:36:59.618 --> 01:37:03.987
Ms. Holder, were you at Joe's Drive-In
on the night of June 11, 1963?

01:37:04.190 --> 01:37:05.316
Yes, sir.

01:37:05.524 --> 01:37:09.255
I wasn't working, but I was there
hanging out with my friends.

01:37:09.762 --> 01:37:12.890
T ell the jury if there came
a time when your attention...

01:37:13.099 --> 01:37:15.590
...was directed towards
any particular automobile.

01:37:17.603 --> 01:37:20.333
Being a carhop, you notice cars.

01:37:20.539 --> 01:37:23.702
This one had a long antenna
on the side of it.

01:37:23.909 --> 01:37:26.343
We thought at first
it was a patrol car.

01:37:26.979 --> 01:37:29.948
It was white and it had
a lot of mud on it.

01:37:30.983 --> 01:37:32.780
It was a Plymouth Valiant.

01:37:32.985 --> 01:37:37.752
Mr. Hargrove, were you employed by the
Jackson Police Department in June 1963?

01:37:37.957 --> 01:37:39.686
Yes, I was.

01:37:39.892 --> 01:37:43.623
In charge of the ldentification Division
for 42 years.

01:37:43.829 --> 01:37:46.957
Did you reach a conclusion
as to whose fingerprint...

01:37:47.166 --> 01:37:49.600
...was on the telescopic side
of the gun...

01:37:49.802 --> 01:37:54.068
...recovered in your presence
on June 12, 1963?

01:37:54.407 --> 01:37:55.669
Yes, sir. I did.

01:37:55.875 --> 01:37:59.174
With 14 points of identification,
there's more than enough...

01:37:59.378 --> 01:38:02.711
...to identify the fingerprint
of Mr. Byron De La Beckwith.

01:38:03.015 --> 01:38:07.281
After four days of testimony in the
trial of white supremacist Beckwith...

01:38:07.486 --> 01:38:10.887
...the prosecution, thus far, has
presented essentially the same case...

01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:12.387
...as was offered up
in the two original trials.

01:38:14.326 --> 01:38:17.454
However, this time there are
two significant differences.

01:38:17.663 --> 01:38:19.722
First, the makeup of the jury.

01:38:19.932 --> 01:38:24.062
In 1964, Beckwith faced
two all-male, all-white juries.

01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:27.899
Today, he faces a jury made up
of eight blacks and four whites.

01:38:28.107 --> 01:38:32.237
Tomorrow the prosecution is expected
to introduce three new witnesses...

01:38:32.445 --> 01:38:35.107
... who did not testify
in the first two trials.

01:38:37.283 --> 01:38:39.274
State your name for the record.

01:38:39.485 --> 01:38:40.918
Delmar Dennis.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.520
Mr. Dennis, in March of 1964...

01:38:43.722 --> 01:38:45.849
...were you a member
of an organization known as...

01:38:46.058 --> 01:38:47.958
...the White Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan?

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:49.286
I was.

01:38:49.495 --> 01:38:51.019
In September of that year...

01:38:51.230 --> 01:38:54.131
...did you become
a paid informant for the FBl?

01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:55.595
I did.

01:38:55.801 --> 01:38:57.701
And in your capacity as informant...

01:38:57.903 --> 01:39:01.498
...did you ever encounter
the defendant, Byron De La Beckwith?

01:39:02.208 --> 01:39:03.539
I did.

01:39:04.543 --> 01:39:06.977
What were the circumstances
of that encounter?

01:39:07.713 --> 01:39:10.841
On August 8, 1965,
I met Mr. Beckwith...

01:39:11.050 --> 01:39:13.245
...at a Klan meeting
in Byram, Mississippi.

01:39:13.519 --> 01:39:15.544
He was a featured speaker that night.

01:39:16.388 --> 01:39:19.915
Now, during that talk, would you tell
the jury what, if anything...

01:39:20.126 --> 01:39:24.620
...the defendant said about the murder
or shooting death of Medgar Evers.

01:39:26.098 --> 01:39:29.067
He said, "Killing that nigger gave me
no more inner discomfort...

01:39:29.268 --> 01:39:32.362
...than our wives endure
giving birth to our children.

01:39:32.571 --> 01:39:34.471
We gotta kill those enemies...

01:39:34.673 --> 01:39:37.665
...including the President,
from the top down."

01:39:38.177 --> 01:39:39.667
Did he say anything else?

01:39:39.979 --> 01:39:41.105
Yes, sir.

01:39:41.313 --> 01:39:44.407
He said, "You're gonna get away
with it like I did."

01:39:45.484 --> 01:39:47.315
Thank you, Mr. Dennis.

01:39:47.653 --> 01:39:48.551
Your witness.

01:39:52.858 --> 01:39:55.691
You have seen FBl reports
about your activities...

01:39:55.895 --> 01:39:57.886
...as a paid informant, haven't you?

01:39:58.430 --> 01:40:00.864
Mr. DeLaughter's office
furnished me with copies.

01:40:01.066 --> 01:40:02.158
In fact, there are...

01:40:02.368 --> 01:40:04.529
...pages and pages of dialogue...

01:40:04.737 --> 01:40:07.171
...that you reported
to the FBl of things...

01:40:07.439 --> 01:40:10.135
...that various people said
over lunch, over dinner...

01:40:10.342 --> 01:40:13.834
...riding in cars, meetings.
Isn't that right?

01:40:15.214 --> 01:40:18.240
Yet, nowhere in all those reports...

01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:22.352
...does the quotation that you
attributed to Mr. Beckwith appear.

01:40:22.555 --> 01:40:23.852
Does it?

01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:27.190
Maybe the pages got lost
over the years.

01:40:27.393 --> 01:40:29.486
And maybe they never existed.

01:40:29.695 --> 01:40:30.627
Objection.

01:40:30.829 --> 01:40:31.796
Sustained.

01:40:32.231 --> 01:40:34.096
Dog ate my homework.

01:40:35.134 --> 01:40:37.694
Mr. Dennis, did Byron De La Beckwith...

01:40:37.903 --> 01:40:41.430
...ever specifically say
that he killed Medgar Evers?

01:40:43.075 --> 01:40:45.976
He never said, "I killed
Medgar Evers. "That's true.

01:40:46.178 --> 01:40:47.270
No further questions.

01:40:47.479 --> 01:40:48.969
That's what he meant.

01:40:49.181 --> 01:40:52.617
We ask that the witness's unsolicited
opinion be stricken...

01:40:52.885 --> 01:40:55.115
...and that the jury disregard it.

01:40:55.854 --> 01:40:59.620
The jury will disregard
Mr. Dennis' last statement.

01:41:00.759 --> 01:41:05.196
I was standing out in the yard,
and he said something to me about...

01:41:05.397 --> 01:41:08.833
...having been tried twice
in Mississippi...

01:41:09.068 --> 01:41:10.626
...for "killing that nigger."

01:41:10.836 --> 01:41:12.463
And what'd he say about that?

01:41:12.671 --> 01:41:13.797
He said...

01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:17.265
... "I had a job to do and I did it."

01:41:17.643 --> 01:41:20.237
Thank you, Mr. Prince.
Nothing further.

01:41:23.015 --> 01:41:26.951
Back in 1986, when Mr. Beckwith
allegedly made this statement to you...

01:41:27.152 --> 01:41:30.144
...you went straight
to the authorities, didn't you?

01:41:31.323 --> 01:41:33.848
Well, you must've told
some of your buddies.

01:41:35.027 --> 01:41:37.996
You didn't tell anybody you were
renting a house from a man...

01:41:38.197 --> 01:41:40.597
...who admitted to you
that he'd killed somebody?

01:41:40.866 --> 01:41:43.198
I didn't at that time, no.

01:41:43.802 --> 01:41:46.600
Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith had you
thrown out of the house...

01:41:46.805 --> 01:41:49.103
...because you had
a drinking problem, right?

01:41:52.911 --> 01:41:55.379
I had a drinking problem...

01:41:56.048 --> 01:41:57.538
...but that's not why they--

01:41:57.750 --> 01:42:01.550
You don't particularly like Mr. Beckwith
for throwing you out, do you?

01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:04.920
Mrs. Morgan...

01:42:05.124 --> 01:42:09.083
...when you lived in Greenwood,
Mississippi in the early 1970s...

01:42:09.295 --> 01:42:13.231
...did you and your husband give
the defendant a ride to Parchman Prison?

01:42:13.465 --> 01:42:14.397
Yes, sir.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:18.036
Me and my husband, Lloyd, was going
to see Lloyd's brother...

01:42:18.237 --> 01:42:19.636
...Jimmy Dale Morgan...

01:42:19.838 --> 01:42:23.467
...and Mr. Beckwith was going to see
some friend of his...

01:42:23.676 --> 01:42:25.837
...whose name he wouldn't tell us.

01:42:26.178 --> 01:42:29.807
During that time, did he make
any statements concerning the murder...

01:42:30.015 --> 01:42:31.482
...of Medgar Evers?

01:42:32.117 --> 01:42:32.981
Yes, sir.

01:42:33.185 --> 01:42:37.281
He said that he had killed
Medgar Evers, a nigger...

01:42:37.489 --> 01:42:41.926
...and said we'd better not say anything
about us driving him up to Parchman...

01:42:42.127 --> 01:42:44.891
...because he wasn't scared
to kill again.

01:42:45.364 --> 01:42:46.558
Thank you, Mrs. Morgan.

01:42:53.305 --> 01:42:55.865
You have had some
very traumatic things...

01:42:56.075 --> 01:42:58.202
...happen to you in your life,
haven't you?

01:42:58.544 --> 01:42:59.943
Most definitely.

01:43:00.145 --> 01:43:01.772
Your estranged husband...

01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:04.608
...Lloyd Morgan, was
very abusive to you.

01:43:04.817 --> 01:43:06.842
Objection. Irrelevant.

01:43:07.619 --> 01:43:09.553
Where are you going with this?

01:43:09.755 --> 01:43:11.120
If you'll allow me...

01:43:11.323 --> 01:43:15.419
...this line of questioning speaks
directly to this witness's credibility.

01:43:16.128 --> 01:43:17.117
Overruled.

01:43:22.501 --> 01:43:24.662
Your husband, you told us...

01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:29.239
...carried on an incestuous
relationship with one of his children.

01:43:29.775 --> 01:43:31.242
Yes, he did.

01:43:31.443 --> 01:43:33.138
And your father...

01:43:33.345 --> 01:43:36.576
...was very abusive to you
when you were a child.

01:43:37.483 --> 01:43:38.780
Yes, sir.

01:43:39.017 --> 01:43:40.279
And as a result...

01:43:40.552 --> 01:43:41.883
...of all this...

01:43:42.121 --> 01:43:45.056
...you have been diagnosed
by psychiatrists...

01:43:45.257 --> 01:43:47.452
...as having an anxiety disorder.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.551
Yes, sir, I have.

01:43:52.231 --> 01:43:54.165
I have nothing further.

01:43:55.567 --> 01:43:59.333
If this jury wants to believe
a lying drunk, a paid informant...

01:43:59.538 --> 01:44:01.062
...and a damn loony bird...

01:44:01.273 --> 01:44:03.264
...then I might be
in a bit of trouble.

01:44:03.475 --> 01:44:04.965
But not as much trouble
as our beloved justice system.

01:44:06.912 --> 01:44:10.439
And this Prince fella
still owes me $ 64 worth of rent.

01:44:10.649 --> 01:44:13.482
How do you account for
the matching numbers on the gun?

01:44:13.685 --> 01:44:17.143
My rifle was stolen days
before this nigger turned up dead.

01:44:17.356 --> 01:44:19.017
Turn those lights off.

01:44:20.025 --> 01:44:23.017
Mom, how can you stand
watching this idiot?

01:44:23.228 --> 01:44:24.752
When your father died...

01:44:24.963 --> 01:44:27.488
...I carried around
such hatred for that man...

01:44:27.699 --> 01:44:30.964
... I actually made inquiries
into having him killed.

01:44:31.837 --> 01:44:34.931
But in time, I was able
to let that hatred go.

01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:36.573
I don't know how.

01:44:36.775 --> 01:44:40.176
I remembered something
your father once said to me.

01:44:40.379 --> 01:44:44.475
He said, "When you hate,
the only person who suffers is you.

01:44:44.683 --> 01:44:46.548
Because most of the people you hate...

01:44:46.752 --> 01:44:49.846
...don't know it
and the others don't care."

01:44:50.255 --> 01:44:53.156
The big question here is
will Beckwith testify...

01:44:53.358 --> 01:44:57.158
...as he did so confidently
back in 1964?

01:44:59.998 --> 01:45:02.899
Everybody wants to see
the Byron De La Beckwith Show.

01:45:03.101 --> 01:45:04.932
What if putting him on is too risky?

01:45:05.137 --> 01:45:06.832
You kidding? He'll wanna tell
that cock-and-bull story...

01:45:08.407 --> 01:45:11.240
...about his gun being stolen
two days before the murder.

01:45:11.443 --> 01:45:15.345
Besides, this is Byron De La Beckwith
we're talking about.

01:45:15.547 --> 01:45:17.913
Summoned from his mountain
by God Almighty...

01:45:18.116 --> 01:45:20.584
...to give us
the word according to Delay.

01:45:21.687 --> 01:45:22.915
He'll testify.

01:45:23.322 --> 01:45:24.812
I'll see you upstairs.

01:45:43.141 --> 01:45:46.076
Something happen to you in your boyhood
make you mean-spirited...

01:45:46.278 --> 01:45:48.109
...enough to turn on your own?

01:45:48.313 --> 01:45:52.875
Do what the good Lord and Mississippi
got every right to expect you to do.

01:45:53.552 --> 01:45:54.382
Which is?

01:45:54.586 --> 01:45:58.852
Putting niggers away for killing white
people instead of the other way around.

01:45:59.057 --> 01:46:03.426
Mr. Peters and y'all should be run out
of this state for this foolishness...

01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:05.221
...and y'all probably will be.

01:46:06.498 --> 01:46:10.628
This is not some deer you brought down.
This is a human being.

01:46:10.836 --> 01:46:14.704
A deer, Mr. DeLaughter,
is a beautiful animal.

01:46:14.907 --> 01:46:16.465
It's one of God's creatures.

01:46:16.675 --> 01:46:19.473
I would never kill a deer.

01:46:19.611 --> 01:46:22.978
A nigger, on the other hand,
that's another matter entirely.

01:46:23.348 --> 01:46:25.748
Are you standing here
admitting to me that you--

01:46:26.118 --> 01:46:27.847
IKilled Medgar Evers?

01:46:28.053 --> 01:46:29.714
What if I did?

01:46:30.155 --> 01:46:33.647
It's not like there's anything you
nor anybody else can do about it.

01:46:33.859 --> 01:46:34.951
Is there?

01:46:35.827 --> 01:46:36.953
We'll see about that.

01:46:37.162 --> 01:46:38.823
Oh, that we will.

01:46:39.031 --> 01:46:40.658
That we will.

01:46:42.668 --> 01:46:45.432
You know, it only takes
but one of them, doesn't it?

01:46:45.871 --> 01:46:47.498
The question is...

01:46:47.706 --> 01:46:49.003
...which one will it be?

01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:52.574
Maybe that chubby white gal
who'd be sorely vexed...

01:46:52.778 --> 01:46:57.181
...to let one of her own kind be
put away, no matter what she told you.

01:46:57.616 --> 01:46:59.447
Or maybe that old nigger minister...

01:46:59.651 --> 01:47:03.883
...who won't want sending a sick
old man to prison on his conscience.

01:47:04.289 --> 01:47:09.226
You ain't never gonna get 12 people
to convict me of killing a nigger...

01:47:09.461 --> 01:47:11.429
...in the state of Mississippi.

01:47:11.630 --> 01:47:14.758
No, sir. Hell, I don't even have
to take the stand.

01:47:14.967 --> 01:47:18.664
Couple more days, I'll be heading back
to my home in T ennessee...

01:47:18.937 --> 01:47:20.871
...where I will sit on my porch...

01:47:21.073 --> 01:47:24.804
...and live out my days
in peace and prosperity.

01:47:25.477 --> 01:47:27.172
What are you gonna do?

01:47:30.582 --> 01:47:32.277
What are you gonna do?

01:47:32.784 --> 01:47:35.275
" Free at last, free at last.

01:47:35.487 --> 01:47:38.456
Great God Almighty, I'm free at last!"

01:47:42.294 --> 01:47:44.228
The defense calls James Holley.

01:47:47.332 --> 01:47:49.357
Relax. He's just needling you.

01:47:50.769 --> 01:47:51.167
He'll testify.

01:47:53.872 --> 01:47:55.305
Raise your right hand.

01:47:55.507 --> 01:47:59.739
You swear the testimony you'll give
is the whole truth, so help you God?

01:47:59.945 --> 01:48:01.913
-I do.
-Be seated.

01:48:04.249 --> 01:48:08.709
Mr. Holley, did you have a personal
relationship with the defendant?

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:12.686
No, sir. None whatsoever.
I just kind of knew who he was.

01:48:12.891 --> 01:48:15.985
Mr. Holley, in the early morning
of June 12th, 1963...

01:48:16.194 --> 01:48:18.628
...did you have occasion
to see Mr. Beckwith?

01:48:19.531 --> 01:48:21.795
He was standing outside
at a Shell station...

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.525
...while the attendant was
putting gas in his car.

01:48:24.836 --> 01:48:26.997
T ell the jury what time
you saw him.

01:48:27.673 --> 01:48:30.301
At approximately 1:03 in the morning.

01:48:31.043 --> 01:48:34.342
About how many miles is it
from Greenwood to Jackson?

01:48:34.846 --> 01:48:38.873
Must be around 90, 95 miles.

01:48:39.084 --> 01:48:42.542
So you saw the defendant
less than an hour after the murder...

01:48:42.754 --> 01:48:47.453
...calmly standing by his car some 95
miles away from the scene of the crime?

01:48:50.262 --> 01:48:52.059
I have nothing further.

01:48:57.102 --> 01:48:58.228
Mr. Holley...

01:48:58.437 --> 01:49:00.871
...on the night you say you saw...

01:49:01.106 --> 01:49:03.870
...Byron De La Beckwith
in Greenwood....

01:49:04.276 --> 01:49:07.074
Delay, as you call him, I believe.
Is that right?

01:49:07.279 --> 01:49:08.678
Delay Beckwith, yes, sir.

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.372
Why do you call him Delay?
Are y'all first-name buddies?

01:49:12.584 --> 01:49:16.111
No, sir. I call him Mr. Beckwith
most of the time.

01:49:17.723 --> 01:49:18.747
We just noted...

01:49:18.957 --> 01:49:21.357
... "Delay's car"
and "Delay and the attendant."

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:24.757
Isn't that exactly what you told
me and my investigators...

01:49:24.963 --> 01:49:27.557
...when we asked what you were
doing that night?

01:49:28.967 --> 01:49:30.298
"Delay."

01:49:30.969 --> 01:49:32.231
Your buddy.

01:49:32.437 --> 01:49:33.961
My friend.

01:49:34.573 --> 01:49:36.973
And how long has he been your friend?

01:49:38.243 --> 01:49:41.144
-Just shortly after World War ll.
-When you said...

01:49:41.346 --> 01:49:45.544
...you had no personal relationship
with him, that wasn't entirely true.

01:49:45.751 --> 01:49:49.653
You've known him a long time and been
friends a long time, right?

01:49:49.855 --> 01:49:51.948
Well, sure, we're friends.

01:49:52.157 --> 01:49:54.318
Just like I hope
you and I are friends.

01:49:56.595 --> 01:49:57.425
Pardon?

01:49:57.662 --> 01:50:00.859
I said just like I would hope
you and I are friends.

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.667
I'm flattered.

01:50:06.238 --> 01:50:07.796
Let me ask you this.

01:50:08.373 --> 01:50:10.466
At the time the defendant
was arrested...

01:50:10.675 --> 01:50:13.337
...there were a whole lot
of law enforcement people...

01:50:13.545 --> 01:50:16.013
...trying to gather
information, am I right?

01:50:16.214 --> 01:50:17.943
FBl, Jackson Police.

01:50:18.150 --> 01:50:19.515
Do you remember that?

01:50:20.051 --> 01:50:21.143
Did you speak to...

01:50:21.353 --> 01:50:24.015
...Detective Sanders,
one of the investigators?

01:50:24.556 --> 01:50:26.353
I might've spoken a word with him.

01:50:26.625 --> 01:50:31.028
Then you told him you saw Beckwith
in Greenwood the night of the killing.

01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:32.662
-ls that right?
-I did not.

01:50:34.065 --> 01:50:34.997
Why not?

01:50:35.333 --> 01:50:37.426
I had no reason to tell
unless he asked.

01:50:37.636 --> 01:50:41.800
You had no reason, as a sworn police
officer, to tell an investigator...

01:50:42.007 --> 01:50:43.531
...in an important murder case...

01:50:43.742 --> 01:50:48.145
...that you knew the suspect was 90
miles away at the time of the murder?

01:50:48.346 --> 01:50:50.974
I'd have been butting
into his investigation--

01:50:51.183 --> 01:50:54.983
You'd have been "butting into his
investigation "by telling him an alibi?

01:50:55.587 --> 01:50:56.815
Sure.

01:50:58.423 --> 01:51:01.586
Did you ever go to the D.A.
and tell them what was going on?

01:51:02.394 --> 01:51:04.828
Did you tell the FBl
what was going on?

01:51:05.730 --> 01:51:09.598
The only person you spoke to
about this case was Hardy Lott...

01:51:09.801 --> 01:51:11.393
...Mr. Beckwith's defense attorney.

01:51:11.603 --> 01:51:14.037
-When he called me--
-How long was...

01:51:14.239 --> 01:51:17.208
...the defendant in jail by then?
A couple of weeks?

01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:20.002
I don't remember, exactly.

01:51:21.313 --> 01:51:23.178
Well, let me help you out.

01:51:23.815 --> 01:51:26.750
It was over eight months.

01:51:27.185 --> 01:51:28.880
Eight months.

01:51:29.087 --> 01:51:32.147
You let your buddy sit in jail
all that time...

01:51:32.357 --> 01:51:35.554
...and never once told anyone,
"You've got the wrong guy."

01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.887
You're asking this jury
to believe that?

01:51:38.797 --> 01:51:40.025
Yes, sir.

01:51:43.668 --> 01:51:47.468
Earlier in your testimony, you said
that you and I are friends, right?

01:51:47.906 --> 01:51:48.736
Said what?

01:51:48.974 --> 01:51:51.875
That we're friends.
You and I are friends.

01:51:54.112 --> 01:51:56.080
You still think we're friends?

01:51:57.282 --> 01:51:58.476
Sure.

01:52:00.385 --> 01:52:02.910
As my friend, if I ever go
to jail for murder...

01:52:03.121 --> 01:52:05.021
...don't leave me there
for eight months...

01:52:05.223 --> 01:52:07.691
...if you know where I was
when the murder took place.

01:52:07.893 --> 01:52:08.723
Objection!

01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.425
That was a thing of beauty.

01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:11.755
Nothing further.

01:52:11.963 --> 01:52:13.225
Will you redirect?

01:52:13.431 --> 01:52:15.058
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:52:16.434 --> 01:52:18.061
Would you lie for Mr. Beckwith?

01:52:18.970 --> 01:52:20.369
Did he ask you to?

01:52:20.605 --> 01:52:24.097
As a former police officer,
you know perjury is a serious crime.

01:52:25.043 --> 01:52:27.136
I'm gonna ask you this one last time.

01:52:27.345 --> 01:52:29.779
On the night that Medgar Evers
was killed...

01:52:29.981 --> 01:52:34.509
...did you or did you not see
Beckwith some 95 miles away...

01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:36.482
...from where the murder took place?

01:52:38.223 --> 01:52:39.315
I saw him.

01:52:39.524 --> 01:52:42.186
As God is your judge.

01:52:43.595 --> 01:52:45.790
As God is my judge.

01:52:46.665 --> 01:52:49.600
Thank you, Mr. Holley.
We have nothing further.

01:52:52.871 --> 01:52:54.338
No further questions.

01:52:55.674 --> 01:52:56.641
You may step down.

01:53:00.578 --> 01:53:03.012
Is the defense prepared to call
its next witness?

01:53:13.391 --> 01:53:14.585
Your Honor...

01:53:14.926 --> 01:53:17.053
...the defense rests.

01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:20.191
-What?
-Damn!

01:53:21.499 --> 01:53:22.488
Quiet.

01:53:24.202 --> 01:53:25.134
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:28.234
Quiet or I'll order the bailiff
to clear the courtroom.

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.635
Coward to the end.

01:53:34.946 --> 01:53:36.607
To my knowledge...

01:53:36.815 --> 01:53:39.511
...this jury is being asked
to look further...

01:53:39.718 --> 01:53:42.744
...into the past than any jury...

01:53:43.455 --> 01:53:46.788
...in the history
of American jurisprudence.

01:53:47.225 --> 01:53:51.594
That places you folks
at a considerable disadvantage.

01:53:52.197 --> 01:53:55.166
Evidence has been lost.

01:53:56.034 --> 01:53:58.093
They don't have the bullet.

01:53:58.470 --> 01:54:02.770
They don't have the spent cartridge
case that was found in the gun.

01:54:02.974 --> 01:54:06.967
They don't have the live ammunition
that was found in the gun.

01:54:07.312 --> 01:54:08.836
Where is it?

01:54:09.914 --> 01:54:11.575
Nobody knows.

01:54:12.484 --> 01:54:15.009
Does this create reasonable doubt?

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.083
Of course it does.

01:54:17.922 --> 01:54:20.948
And you have heard a number
of witnesses testify...

01:54:21.159 --> 01:54:24.560
...that years after the crime,
Mr. Beckwith said this...

01:54:24.763 --> 01:54:26.754
...or Mr. Beckwith said that.

01:54:27.032 --> 01:54:31.401
But the defense has presented you
with an eyewitness.

01:54:31.603 --> 01:54:34.299
A sworn officer of the law...

01:54:34.506 --> 01:54:38.875
...who has testified under oath
that he saw the defendant...

01:54:39.077 --> 01:54:43.639
...in Greenwood, Mississippi,
over 90 miles from Jackson...

01:54:43.848 --> 01:54:46.783
...Iess than an hour after the murder.

01:54:48.386 --> 01:54:50.684
Does that create reasonable doubt?

01:54:51.523 --> 01:54:53.150
You bet it does.

01:54:53.858 --> 01:54:57.760
And reasonable doubt
means one thing...

01:54:58.029 --> 01:54:59.860
...and one thing only.

01:55:00.465 --> 01:55:01.864
By law...

01:55:02.133 --> 01:55:05.796
...you must render
a not guilty verdict.

01:55:06.604 --> 01:55:10.005
Forget that it's Byron "Delay" Beckwith.

01:55:10.475 --> 01:55:13.933
Forget that you may not like him,
that you...

01:55:14.145 --> 01:55:16.306
...may not agree with him.

01:55:17.382 --> 01:55:19.213
Judge the evidence...

01:55:19.851 --> 01:55:21.819
...and judge it fairly.

01:55:22.821 --> 01:55:24.186
Because...

01:55:24.389 --> 01:55:26.653
...in the United States...

01:55:27.058 --> 01:55:31.324
...we don't do that for people
we just like and admire.

01:55:32.497 --> 01:55:34.795
We do that for everybody...

01:55:34.999 --> 01:55:36.364
...that's on trial...

01:55:36.568 --> 01:55:38.866
...in an American court of law.

01:55:39.604 --> 01:55:42.664
Because if the system doesn't work...

01:55:42.874 --> 01:55:44.865
...for Byron De La Beckwith...

01:55:45.076 --> 01:55:46.100
...it doesn't work...

01:55:46.611 --> 01:55:48.238
...for anyone.

01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:52.973
I ask you to let the system work...

01:55:54.519 --> 01:55:56.578
...and once and for all...

01:55:56.921 --> 01:55:58.752
...find the defendant...

01:55:59.090 --> 01:56:02.526
...Byron De La Beckwith,
not guilty.

01:56:05.296 --> 01:56:06.763
Thank you.

01:56:21.379 --> 01:56:23.370
An unarmed man...

01:56:23.882 --> 01:56:27.181
...arrives home in the late hours
of the night...

01:56:27.385 --> 01:56:30.183
...home to his family, his wife...

01:56:30.388 --> 01:56:32.379
...and three small children...

01:56:33.124 --> 01:56:35.217
...gets out of his car...

01:56:35.793 --> 01:56:37.954
...and with his back turned...

01:56:38.296 --> 01:56:40.787
...is gunned down by a coward.

01:56:42.734 --> 01:56:44.599
That coward is...

01:56:44.802 --> 01:56:46.394
...Byron De La Beckwith.

01:56:47.572 --> 01:56:48.971
His gun.

01:56:49.407 --> 01:56:50.772
His scope.

01:56:50.975 --> 01:56:52.374
His fingerprint.

01:56:52.577 --> 01:56:53.874
His car.

01:56:54.078 --> 01:56:58.208
And lastly, but certainly not least,
his mouth.

01:56:59.417 --> 01:57:01.282
When he thought he got away with it...

01:57:01.486 --> 01:57:05.115
...he couldn't keep his mouth shut
with people he wanted to impress.

01:57:05.323 --> 01:57:08.315
And now his venom has come back
to do him in...

01:57:08.526 --> 01:57:10.153
...because, ladies and gentlemen...

01:57:10.361 --> 01:57:13.853
...there is no statute
of limitations on murder.

01:57:14.432 --> 01:57:17.060
The law doesn't say
that if you killed someone...

01:57:17.268 --> 01:57:19.133
... 10 years ago or 20 years ago...

01:57:19.337 --> 01:57:23.398
...or even 30 years ago,
that you don't have to pay the price.

01:57:23.608 --> 01:57:27.567
The law doesn't say that if you are
50 years old or 60 years old...

01:57:27.779 --> 01:57:31.738
...or 70 years old,
that you don't have to pay the price.

01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:33.611
No man...

01:57:34.452 --> 01:57:36.249
...is above the law.

01:57:39.057 --> 01:57:40.820
And for what reason...

01:57:41.025 --> 01:57:42.925
...was Medgar Evers' life taken?

01:57:43.127 --> 01:57:47.427
For wanting some degree
of equality for himself...

01:57:47.632 --> 01:57:49.998
...his family and his fellow man.

01:57:50.201 --> 01:57:54.297
Ladies and gentlemen,
when that kind of murder happens...

01:57:54.706 --> 01:57:56.970
...no matter who the victim...

01:57:57.375 --> 01:57:59.673
...no matter what his race...

01:57:59.877 --> 01:58:02.277
...there is a gaping wound...

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:05.813
...Iaid open on society as a whole.

01:58:07.819 --> 01:58:09.218
Justice...

01:58:09.821 --> 01:58:11.812
...has sometimes been referred to...

01:58:12.023 --> 01:58:13.991
...as the soothing balm
to be applied...

01:58:14.192 --> 01:58:16.752
...to the wounds inflicted on society.

01:58:16.961 --> 01:58:18.758
But when there is no justice...

01:58:18.963 --> 01:58:22.228
...those wounds can never be cleansed.

01:58:23.167 --> 01:58:26.398
Those wounds can never be healed.

01:58:29.073 --> 01:58:31.507
When I addressed you
in my opening statement...

01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:34.576
...I said that this was a simple case.

01:58:34.779 --> 01:58:37.339
Well, I was right and I was wrong.

01:58:37.682 --> 01:58:39.707
The evidence is simple...

01:58:39.917 --> 01:58:41.976
...and the conclusion is
more than obvious.

01:58:42.186 --> 01:58:43.778
But the reason we are all...

01:58:43.988 --> 01:58:46.616
...sitting in this courtroom
so many years after...

01:58:46.824 --> 01:58:49.520
...this disgraceful
assassination took place...

01:58:49.761 --> 01:58:52.423
...is anything but simple.

01:58:54.766 --> 01:58:56.734
President John F. Kennedy...

01:58:56.934 --> 01:58:59.767
...in his landmark civil rights speech
to the nation...

01:58:59.971 --> 01:59:04.340
...delivered on the very night
Medgar Evers was murdered, said...

01:59:04.542 --> 01:59:08.273
... "We face a moral crisis
as a country...

01:59:08.546 --> 01:59:10.036
...and as a people.

01:59:10.948 --> 01:59:14.679
Those who do nothing are
inviting shame...

01:59:14.886 --> 01:59:17.047
...as well as violence.

01:59:17.355 --> 01:59:21.587
Those who act boldly are
recognizing right...

01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.851
...as well as reality."

01:59:26.130 --> 01:59:29.293
Today, 30 years later...

01:59:29.634 --> 01:59:31.966
...on behalf of the state
of Mississippi...

01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:36.971
...I'm asking you 12 ladies
and gentlemen to act boldly.

01:59:37.241 --> 01:59:41.200
To hold this defendant accountable
and find him guilty...

01:59:41.412 --> 01:59:43.437
...simply because it is right...

01:59:43.648 --> 01:59:44.945
...it is just...

01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:48.243
...and Lord knows, it is time.

01:59:51.823 --> 01:59:53.154
Is it ever...

01:59:53.725 --> 01:59:56.455
...too late to do the right thing?

01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:01.228
For the sake of justice...

02:00:01.432 --> 02:00:05.493
...and for the hope of us
as a civilized society...

02:00:06.604 --> 02:00:10.404
...I sincerely pray that it is not.

02:00:13.811 --> 02:00:14.800
Thank you.

02:00:17.448 --> 02:00:19.279
How long do you think they'll be out?

02:00:19.617 --> 02:00:23.144
All I know is a short time is good
and a long time is...

02:00:23.554 --> 02:00:24.452
...not so good.

02:00:24.956 --> 02:00:26.890
Then I'll pray for a short time.

02:00:29.026 --> 02:00:31.859
This reminds me of Medgar's office
on Lynch Street.

02:00:32.063 --> 02:00:34.827
You know, I used to be
Medgar's secretary.

02:00:35.933 --> 02:00:38.231
He insisted that we behave
in the office...

02:00:38.436 --> 02:00:41.337
...strictly as employer-employee.

02:00:41.539 --> 02:00:45.100
He'd call me Mrs. Evers,
and I'd have to call him Mr. Evers.

02:00:45.309 --> 02:00:46.776
Is that right?

02:00:47.211 --> 02:00:49.338
Everybody thought he was crazy.

02:00:49.547 --> 02:00:52.846
But he was just so determined
to do a good job.

02:00:56.554 --> 02:00:58.283
You remind me of Medgar.

02:01:03.728 --> 02:01:05.161
Thank you, ma'am.

02:01:06.330 --> 02:01:08.321
Would you like a cup of coffee?

02:01:08.566 --> 02:01:09.760
No, thanks.

02:01:11.936 --> 02:01:15.736
As many trials as I've been through
and I can never take the waiting.

02:01:16.174 --> 02:01:17.266
Wanna go for a walk?

02:01:17.675 --> 02:01:20.769
No, you go ahead. I've gotten
pretty good at waiting.

02:01:40.431 --> 02:01:41.898
That Judge Hilburn...

02:01:42.099 --> 02:01:43.794
...he don't have a lot of patience.

02:01:44.001 --> 02:01:46.765
That jury ain't back with a verdict
in a few hours...

02:01:46.971 --> 02:01:48.336
...he'll declare a mistrial.

02:01:48.539 --> 02:01:50.302
I'm not sure I got that.

02:01:50.508 --> 02:01:53.341
Would you mind repeating that,
please?

02:01:53.544 --> 02:01:55.307
You did say mistrial, didn't you?

02:01:55.513 --> 02:01:56.741
I'm gonna snooch you.

02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:14.058
All rise.

02:02:32.850 --> 02:02:34.784
When the verdict is read...

02:02:34.986 --> 02:02:37.352
...there will be no demonstrations...

02:02:37.555 --> 02:02:40.547
...or any emotional outbursts
of any type.

02:03:05.850 --> 02:03:08.045
Has the jury reached a verdict?

02:03:08.753 --> 02:03:10.084
It has, Your Honor.

02:03:10.288 --> 02:03:12.222
If the bailiff will hand me
the verdict.

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:40.075
I'll ask the jury at this time
to stand and face the defendant.

02:03:44.255 --> 02:03:46.155
The defendant will face the jury.

02:03:54.398 --> 02:03:56.866
The jury foreman will now
read the verdict.

02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:00.198
We the jury...

02:04:00.404 --> 02:04:01.803
...find the defendant...

02:04:02.006 --> 02:04:06.136
...Byron De La Beckwith,
guilty as charged.

02:04:13.985 --> 02:04:15.646
-Quiet in this courtroom.
-Guilty.

02:04:49.553 --> 02:04:52.750
Mrs. Evers, how did you feel
when the verdict came in?

02:05:14.979 --> 02:05:18.471
It's been a long journey.

02:05:21.686 --> 02:05:24.849
Medgar, I've gone the last mile
of the way.

02:05:26.357 --> 02:05:29.417
I've gone the last mile of the way.

02:05:31.829 --> 02:05:33.820
And all I want to say...

02:05:34.398 --> 02:05:36.559
...is yea, Medgar!
