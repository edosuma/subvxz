WEBVTT

01:15.992 --> 01:20.705
There are eclipsing binaries,
astrometric binaries,

01:20.789 --> 01:22.832
spectroscopic binaries.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.671
It's hard to tell which one we're in
without a map of the star system.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.011
You're doing it again.
Doing what?

01:36.679 --> 01:37.514
Shh.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.183
Using astrophysics
as a smokescreen.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.185
Just tell me the bad news.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.273
Okay, fine.

01:50.026 --> 01:55.156
If this is our planet and this is a sun,

01:56.449 --> 01:59.369
a typical orbit looks like this.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.040
Okay, so I'm guessing
our orbit isn't typical.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.834
The way the ecosphere
has been behaving,

02:05.917 --> 02:08.211
the longer days
and the increased temperatures,

02:08.294 --> 02:12.507
I couldn't figure it out
until I got up there and I saw this.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.053
A coffee mug?

02:17.595 --> 02:22.851
A black hole.
Hiding just off the shoulder of our sun.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.979
The gravitational pull
is altering the orbit,

02:26.062 --> 02:29.691
pulling our planet closer and closer,
until, when it makes this turn,

02:30.483 --> 02:33.653
nothing on the surface,
I mean nothing, will survive.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.454
How long do we have?

02:44.205 --> 02:46.207
Till the planet becomes uninhabitable?

02:47.458 --> 02:49.544
Weeks, maybe months.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.130
It's hard to know
without more information.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.301
So, we have a decision to make.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.428
Do we tell people?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.097
You're asking me?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.099
Yeah, I'm asking you.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.520
Honestly, I don't know.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.857
I mean, God, Maureen,

03:10.940 --> 03:13.484
you should have seen their faces
out there tonight.

03:13.568 --> 03:19.741
Looking to me to answer questions
about that machine that I don't have.

03:22.243 --> 03:26.122
So, tomorrow I get to clean up that mess.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.958
-This one--
-It's okay.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.419
I'll figure it out.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.592
Whatever you decide, I'll support you.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.783
<i>Twenty-seven people died crashing here.</i>

04:02.158 --> 04:03.910
<i>Husbands, wives, friends.</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:06.120
Dead because of what that thing did.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.623
What about last night?
It was protecting us.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.667
-It was defending itself!
-Who knows what would've happened.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.002
-Maybe it can help us--
-Please! Enough!

04:15.088 --> 04:18.716
One at a time.
Let's not have this devolve into chaos.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.678
Victor, if I could make a suggestion.

04:22.845 --> 04:27.225
Maybe we should hear from someone
who has seen, firsthand,

04:27.308 --> 04:29.560
what this thing is capable of.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.818
Angela, would you like
to tell us anything?

04:43.116 --> 04:47.036
My husband was the seventh musician
chosen for relocation.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.248
He played cello.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.545
He loved football and hated the rain.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.591
He was the best part of my life,

05:01.092 --> 05:06.014
and that thing murdered him
in front of me.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.560
So to be forced to sit here,

05:11.060 --> 05:14.939
listening to people wonder
how they can use it...

05:16.482 --> 05:17.984
sickens me.

05:19.902 --> 05:23.364
I think the best course of action would be
to treat this as we would at home.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.743
If a man had committed
any of these crimes--

05:26.826 --> 05:28.328
But it's not a man.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.706
Isn't that the point?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.375
Angela...

05:36.377 --> 05:39.464
I'm truly sorry
about what happened to your husband.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.844
There is nothing that we can do or say
that can replace that loss.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.847
But I think that it's important
that we understand

05:47.930 --> 05:49.557
that the robot has changed.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.643
John, what are you--
-Let him speak.

05:52.727 --> 05:58.900
Okay. Think of it like a computer
that's been rebooted or reprogrammed.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.030
Look, I don't know
what the hell this thing was before,

06:04.113 --> 06:07.867
or why it's here now,
but what I do know is

06:08.701 --> 06:10.953
that the only reason
my daughter is alive today

06:11.037 --> 06:14.415
is because that machine saved her life.

06:16.042 --> 06:20.880
And it kept my family safe...
when I couldn't.

06:22.715 --> 06:26.594
We're in a place where I think
we'd all like to feel a little safer.

06:26.677 --> 06:31.224
Yeah, and, uh...
what if it changes again?

06:31.641 --> 06:34.227
Who's going to keep us safe from it?

06:34.310 --> 06:36.771
You saw it for yourself.
It listens to my son.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.898
So you'd put our safety
in the hands of a child?

06:38.981 --> 06:40.358
It worked last night.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.485
Only difference is,
now you all know about it.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.490
Okay, everyone. I think we should try
and reach a consensus here.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.118
Let's begin with the fact
that we can't control this thing,

06:50.201 --> 06:53.121
-nor do we understand it.
We might need its help again.

07:00.211 --> 07:04.132
-Angela, wait.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.760
I just wanted to say, you're not alone.

07:08.302 --> 07:12.432
I lost a very dear friend in the crash.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.269
I buried her with my own hands.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.771
Very sorry to hear that.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.443
It's good to see that you're on your feet.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.653
I knew you were a fighter
when we found you.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.824
When <i>you</i> found me?

07:30.783 --> 07:34.120
Don West didn't mention
that I was there with...

07:35.288 --> 07:37.582
I was the one who insisted that...

07:38.374 --> 07:42.545
Never mind.
Some people need to feel like a hero.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.757
I'm just happy to see you're on the mend.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.594
Well, thank you.

07:51.179 --> 07:55.641
For what it's worth,
after trauma like you've endured,

07:55.725 --> 07:58.561
it could be helpful
to speak with a professional.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.439
I'm a therapist.
I'd be happy to help you--

08:01.522 --> 08:04.066
No, I appreciate it,

08:04.150 --> 08:09.405
but I'm focusing on my physical therapy
at the moment.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.823
Maybe some other time.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.950
No problem.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.536
Enjoy your walk.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.478
-Ah, research.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.400
If I brought some of that back, too,
would that be worth something to somebody?

08:46.817 --> 08:51.656
Uh... only if you could keep it
from becoming contaminated.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.491
Could you teach me?

09:00.331 --> 09:02.416
Not enough time.
-Oh.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.048
Thank you.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.224
Thanks. Oh, here.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.184
What's this for?

09:20.768 --> 09:25.439
Protection. In case you didn't notice,
it's getting dangerous around here.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.734
Last time a pretty lady
offered me protection,

09:28.818 --> 09:31.404
-it was because we were--

09:50.715 --> 09:52.592
Maybe you should go back inside.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.677
But I thought we could help.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.972
I mean, there are a lot of heavy things
and he can--

09:58.055 --> 10:01.642
Inside. Just until your dad gets back.
Go on.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.228
Okay.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.282
Having fun?

10:25.374 --> 10:26.208
Uh...

10:26.876 --> 10:29.879
If you're wondering if rotting meat
smells the same here as it does on Earth,

10:29.962 --> 10:31.464
then the answer is yes.

10:31.547 --> 10:34.967
Well, I'm going swimming at the waterfall.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.887
-We haven't tested the water yet.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.847
So it could kill you.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.353
Besides, I told my dad I'd do this, so...

10:45.436 --> 10:48.939
All right, whatever. I'm gonna go.
You can come if you want.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.030
Wait up.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.623
John, tell Maureen I'd like to talk to her
when she has a minute.

11:05.706 --> 11:06.832
About what?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.378
We're out of fuel, can't reach
the<i> Resolute,</i> audibly or visibly.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.548
Might be time to consider the reality
of long-term habitation of the planet.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.968
Right. I'll let her know.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.442
How'd it go?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.737
-The robot stays.
-Yes!

11:37.697 --> 11:39.532
But there are conditions.

11:40.074 --> 11:44.954
You keep it away from other people,
you report any changes in behavior,

11:45.037 --> 11:48.416
and register its whereabouts at all times.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.419
Yeah, no problem.
I want to show you something.

11:56.298 --> 11:59.301
-He doesn't get it.
-Let him be happy for a minute.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.726
-Victor's outside. Wants to talk.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.062
You gonna tell him?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.480
About what?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.191
The coffee mug.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.319
I made a list.
Stuff the robot could do to help people.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.489
And then when they see how awesome he is,
they'll accept him.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.576
Actually, I had something else in mind.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.458
I'll tell you later.
It's kind of a father-son thing.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.675
Actually, I forgot,
it's more of a father-son-robot thing.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.644
John, are you forgetting something?

12:51.353 --> 12:53.939
Oh, yeah. Right. We're heading off.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.368
Man, those Robinsons
can be a real pain in the ass, right?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.912
Always sticking their noses in--

13:07.995 --> 13:09.705
-Don West.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.916
I wouldn't expect a guy like you
to know a guy like me,

13:11.999 --> 13:14.001
but you look like someone
who can get things done.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.628
Talk to Peter Beckert.
He handles my affairs.

13:15.711 --> 13:18.214
What if I told you
I knew where a man could get rocket fuel?

13:18.964 --> 13:23.385
You know, enough to get everyone here
off this planet, back into space?

13:23.469 --> 13:26.180
I'd say you were mistaken. Whatever fuel
was left in the Jupiters is gone.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.516
Oh, the eels. Yeah.
Yeah, heard about them.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.934
Ugh.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.061
From what I understand,

13:32.144 --> 13:34.688
those slippery bastards
need moisture to survive.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.067
My crew and I, we crashed in the desert.

13:38.776 --> 13:42.780
Auxiliary fuel tanks, untouched,
just sitting there,

13:43.447 --> 13:46.075
waiting for a smart community leader
to claim them.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.453
Dare I say, that man will be a hero.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.705
And what would that make you?

13:53.207 --> 13:56.794
Significantly wealthier.
You can arrange that, right?

13:59.380 --> 14:00.714
Great. See you in a bit.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.810
Ooh, the future.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.646
What's your schedule like
the next 24 hours?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.065
Come on.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.452
Mom, what are you doing?

15:53.535 --> 15:56.038
I'm just bringing some supplies
in case we have to spend--

15:56.121 --> 15:57.748
You don't think you're going, do you?

15:58.540 --> 15:59.875
Of course I'm going.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.879
You need to rest. You haven't
given yourself time to properly heal.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.507
I'm healing fine. I'll heal later.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.136
I don't think you fully comprehend
how badly we need that fuel.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.137
I fully do.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.516
Which is why we can't bring anyone
whose physical limitations

16:15.599 --> 16:16.767
might get in the way.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.978
It's a straightforward thing.

16:19.061 --> 16:23.607
We find the Jupiter, we transfer the fuel,
we bring it home. We got this.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.150
Let someone else save the day for once.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.278
It's not that, it's

16:31.991 --> 16:34.326
Okay. Go.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.205
Just make sure
you bring that fuel back safely, okay?

16:44.837 --> 16:48.924
Just be safe out there.
You don't know what you might find.

16:49.883 --> 16:50.801
Okay.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.629
I wish.  Just work stuff.

17:27.713 --> 17:28.797
Mmm.

17:29.631 --> 17:33.844
Have many people been talking to you?
In a professional capacity?

17:33.927 --> 17:37.181
Yeah, some. It's an unusual time.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.807
Yeah.

17:38.891 --> 17:43.520
Would you like to talk to me?
In a professional capacity?

17:44.438 --> 17:47.566
-I wouldn't want to impose.
-Not a problem.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.158
Have you ever spoken
to a therapist before?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.409
No.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.578
You and John--

17:59.661 --> 18:01.455
Oh, no, that wouldn't have worked.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.040
Never know until you try.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.585
Yeah, well,
it's a bit late for that anyway.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.215
What's on your mind?

18:12.549 --> 18:13.801
It's about you, actually.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.887
Me?

18:16.970 --> 18:18.680
I was wondering how you deal with it.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.266
Being the keeper of all those secrets.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.229
With all the things people tell you.

18:28.774 --> 18:33.987
Oh, it's just... part of the job.

18:34.530 --> 18:40.369
Don't you ever feel a responsibility to...
I don't know, tell someone?

18:40.452 --> 18:43.997
I can't. Doctor-patient privilege.

18:44.957 --> 18:45.874
But...

18:48.210 --> 18:50.462
What if you found something out

18:50.546 --> 18:54.049
that really would impact
someone else's life?

18:54.133 --> 18:57.344
I mean, how do you keep that in?

18:57.427 --> 18:59.429
Look, here's the thing.

19:00.973 --> 19:05.269
You have to find a place inside...

19:08.856 --> 19:10.482
a little box...

19:13.652 --> 19:16.530
where you put things
you don't want anyone else to know.

19:19.366 --> 19:25.289
And that box has to be airtight,
so nothing gets out.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.794
Once something goes in there,
it stays in there.

19:33.297 --> 19:38.594
Where it can't hurt you... or anyone else.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.141
It's the only way to survive.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.313
-Okay.

19:51.106 --> 19:55.110
Is there something that you'd like me
to help put in your box?

19:59.656 --> 20:00.991
Dr. Smith speaking.

20:01.074 --> 20:03.952
<i> It's Angela. We spoke earlier.</i>

20:04.036 --> 20:05.996
Yes, how are you?

20:06.079 --> 20:08.332
<i>If the offer still stands, I...</i>

20:08.790 --> 20:09.917
Sorry, it's a patient.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.087
-Oh, yes. Oh, of course, yeah.
-Okay.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.005
We'll talk again.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.382
Okay, excuse me.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.512
Yes, Angela. Where are you?

20:22.596 --> 20:24.264
<i>I'm at the Watanabe Jupiter.</i>

20:24.681 --> 20:25.849
I'll be right over.

20:30.812 --> 20:31.939
Come on, Will.

20:37.444 --> 20:40.405
That's okay, but, uh, thanks.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.449
We have ones like that back on Earth.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.376
Whoa.

20:56.713 --> 20:57.547
Thanks.

21:14.106 --> 21:14.940
Will! Coming!

21:27.744 --> 21:29.037
You teach him to do that?

21:29.663 --> 21:32.624
No. I guess he must've seen
one of us doing it.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.086
I guess he's, uh... I guess he's learning.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.046
Hmm.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.177
I just realized.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.432
-I forgot to say thank you.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.518
Sticking up for him.

21:51.601 --> 21:54.521
I wasn't sticking up for anybody.
I was just stating the facts.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.689
But still.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.860
Can you imagine what it's gonna be like
when we get to Alpha Centauri?

21:59.943 --> 22:02.654
I'll be the only kid with his own robot.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.072
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.575
Penny's always saying
how she wants to write a book.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.119
-Maybe she can write it about us.
-Will.

22:09.786 --> 22:13.040
Sorry. What are we doing exactly?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.125
You'll find out when we get there.

22:30.891 --> 22:34.102
Repaired about a hundred of these,
never once got to drive one.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.396
But you do know how to drive, right?

22:49.743 --> 22:53.372
-Must be gas, trapped below the surface.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.082
They're called cryogeysers.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.625
On Mars, they spit CO2.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.044
On Triton, it's nitrogen.
Heat from the sun--

22:59.127 --> 23:01.421
All right, whatever.
Is it safe to keep going?

23:01.505 --> 23:02.589
As long as we stay up here

23:02.672 --> 23:04.800
and don't drive
into the field of exploding rocks.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.095
<i>What's going on</i>

23:09.346 --> 23:12.390
That's a negative, Captain.
We're just plotting our course.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.559
We're not here for sightseeing.
Let's move.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.941
-That's the best idea this guy has had.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.235
Let's move.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.028
Don, this isn't a road trip.

23:29.699 --> 23:30.617
It is now.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.375
<i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪</i>

23:39.960 --> 23:41.294
Whoo-hoo!

23:43.922 --> 23:45.298

23:47.342 --> 23:49.052

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-You're not supposed to open that.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.566
Why would they put a sunroof
if we couldn't open it?

24:02.649 --> 24:04.693
It's not a sunroof.
It's an emergency escape hatch.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.278
Given everything that's happened,

24:06.361 --> 24:08.113
don't you think
we deserve a little escape?

24:09.364 --> 24:10.574
You know you wanna.

24:11.491 --> 24:15.787
Come on, Doc.
Get up there, reach up to the sky.

24:16.371 --> 24:19.749
Huh? Give us a "whoo-hoo"
like it's a limo on prom night.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.836
-Yeah, well, I never went to prom.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.296
Yeah. I was studying for MCATS.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.424
Then you, my nerdy friend,
have a lot of catching up to do.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.593
-Up you go. Come on.
Do it!

24:29.676 --> 24:30.886
-Come on, Judy.
-Come on.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.471
Come on, Doc.
Come on.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.597
Let's go.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.558
Yes, finally. Loosening up.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.643

24:40.353 --> 24:45.859

24:52.616 --> 24:53.825
You've got to be kidding me.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.244

24:57.287 --> 25:00.582
It looks like she's having fun. Can we--

25:00.665 --> 25:02.542
No, Diane, we cannot.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.878
Get her back inside. Now.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.338
Come back. Come back in.

25:09.507 --> 25:12.135
Copy that, sir.
We're having visibility issues.

25:12.219 --> 25:15.263
-We got bug ass all over the windshield.
<i>Enough, West.</i>

25:15.805 --> 25:17.265
Better pray that fuel is still there.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.310
Seeing that this is our last chance
off this planet,

25:20.393 --> 25:21.895
think we better all pray.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.399

26:00.433 --> 26:03.436
We're not much of an advertisement
for space travel, are we?

26:05.272 --> 26:06.815
It should come with a warning.

26:07.274 --> 26:11.027
"Your trip to Alpha Centauri may cause
anxiety and high blood pressure.

26:11.653 --> 26:15.031
Side effects could include
loss of communication,

26:15.115 --> 26:17.075
eels in your fuel tank."

26:17.158 --> 26:18.994
"Alien robots."

26:20.912 --> 26:25.458
I'm sorry. I should have said something.
Especially to you, and I...

26:25.542 --> 26:28.878
Yeah, understood. Personal choice.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.760
There is something, though,
that I need to share with you.

26:36.219 --> 26:40.348
You have family here, and I...
You deserve to know that--

26:40.432 --> 26:42.726
That they may not be safe here
much longer.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.478
How... What? How did you--

26:45.562 --> 26:47.897
Lucky guess. But there are signs.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.109
Erratic weather patterns,
wildlife migration.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.904
Even the oldest trees have only one ring.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.241
The life cycle on this planet
is quite remarkable.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.411
Birth, death, repeat.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.288
Why didn't you say something?

27:03.371 --> 27:06.416
It would have been irresponsible.
Cause panic.

27:06.833 --> 27:09.002
You saw how they were
with your boy's machine.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.255
And we're scientists, Maureen.

27:12.797 --> 27:16.301
Just because we know something,
we're not compelled to broadcast it.

27:17.218 --> 27:20.347
Information does not exist in isolation.

27:21.264 --> 27:23.141
There's consequences. Context.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.935
How do we tell our children?

27:27.687 --> 27:30.857
If they come back with the fuel,
we'll all get off this planet.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.693
Everybody will be happy.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.490
Go dress your wounds, get some rest.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.034
They'll need you when they get back.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.922
<i>How far are we going exactly?</i>

27:54.756 --> 27:57.384
Come on. Have you ever heard
of the phrase "carpe diem"?

27:57.467 --> 27:59.135
Yeah, "seize the day."

27:59.219 --> 28:02.639
But can't we seize it
from the safety of the Jupiter?

28:02.722 --> 28:05.308
Where is your sense of adventure?

28:06.559 --> 28:10.522
We're on an alien planet.
How much more adventure do you need?

28:10.605 --> 28:12.857
Just, like, a little bit.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.152
And if you will follow me...

28:21.449 --> 28:24.202
-It's a cool waterfall, Penny.
-Shut up.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.746
Where did it go?

28:26.830 --> 28:30.625
It dried up. It's been getting hotter,
maybe the glacier melted.

28:30.708 --> 28:33.253
This planet sucks.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.630
It's not a big deal.

28:37.215 --> 28:40.009
-We could go somewhere else--
-No, I had it all planned.

28:41.094 --> 28:41.928
All what planned?

28:42.804 --> 28:45.348
This. Here. You. Me.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.892
I was gonna fall in
and pretend to be in trouble,

28:47.976 --> 28:49.519
and then you would jump in and save me.

28:49.602 --> 28:52.355
And we would be wet and laughing
at how stupid it was,

28:52.439 --> 28:54.107
and then you would lean in and...

28:55.233 --> 28:57.235
-Nothing.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.530
Come on,
it was just getting to the good part.

29:00.613 --> 29:03.032
That's not funny. Forget it, it's ruined.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.617
Don't say that. Well...

29:05.285 --> 29:07.704
-maybe tomorrow we can do something.
No, we can't.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.707
-We have plenty of time.
-No, actually, we don't.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.085
We're stranded here, Penny.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.506
We have all the time we want.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.259
The planet is dying, okay?

29:23.261 --> 29:24.137
What?

29:24.679 --> 29:26.848
I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm sorry.

29:27.849 --> 29:31.060
What are you... What do you mean?

29:33.897 --> 29:37.609
My mom says that there's
a giant black hole somewhere up there,

29:37.692 --> 29:41.654
and all I know is that no one
and nothing is gonna survive it.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.656
Are you serious?

29:46.910 --> 29:48.286
We have to tell people. My dad--

29:48.369 --> 29:51.706
No. No, no, no.
I'm not even supposed to know.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.041
You can't tell anybody.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.794
Please, promise me
you're not gonna tell anybody.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.506
-Promise me.
-Okay, I promise.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.511
Then let's go.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.910
This doesn't make sense.

30:30.453 --> 30:33.331
It was here. It was right here.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.394
I knew this was a mistake.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.230
Maybe it fell.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.109
You brought us all the way here for
"Maybe it fell"?

31:01.776 --> 31:03.987
Deal's off, West. Let's go.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.489
Everybody load up.
Maybe we'll get back before dark.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.410
What does he mean, "deal's off"?
What deal?

31:10.827 --> 31:13.913
-Nothing. It doesn't matter.
Oh, what, he didn't tell you?

31:14.414 --> 31:17.000
Your pal here demanded money
to show us where the fuel was.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.459
He's a real hero.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.589
Don?

31:25.508 --> 31:29.596
In my defense, it was supposed to be
a confidential-type arrangement.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.141
This is about our survival,

31:33.224 --> 31:35.852
life and death,
and you were holding it hostage?

31:35.935 --> 31:39.731
Okay, so, when a doctor gets paid
for saving someone's life, that's okay.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.274
-But when a guy like me--
-That's different.

31:41.357 --> 31:45.820
Different how? If the fuel was here,
everyone would've been saved 'cause of me.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.573
You get on a shuttle to the new world.
What do I get?

31:48.907 --> 31:49.949
A hearty handshake

31:50.033 --> 31:52.577
and a ticket back to a dying planet
with no future.

31:52.660 --> 31:56.372
So forgive me, princess,
if I ask for a little compensation.

32:02.795 --> 32:03.796
Did you hear that?

32:05.882 --> 32:07.008
Oh, my God! It's here.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.178
Hey, it's here!
Come here, we've been standing on it!

32:14.223 --> 32:16.768
Look for the top hatch.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.520
Whoa, whoa!
-Okay, whoa, whoa.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.731
Whoa. Slow, slow, slow. Back up slowly.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.616
See, I knew it was here the whole time.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.786
We don't know if the fuel's still inside.
Don't count your chickens.

32:34.869 --> 32:39.248
Oh, I won't be counting them, sir.
I only have the one. Her name is Debbie.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.627
So, who's got the shovel?

32:50.802 --> 32:54.347
According to the meter, tank's full.
Just like West said.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.766
Apology accepted.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.228
Fill her up. Let's get out of here.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.043
This is amazing.

33:25.586 --> 33:26.629
Yep.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.550
But we're not here for the view, Will.

33:30.633 --> 33:33.011
Then why did we hike up all this way?

33:35.346 --> 33:39.142
Grab me a rock from over there.
Big one, bring it over here.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.854
-Just do it.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.442
Come on, I need to go grab a rock.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.693
Not him.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.320
Just you.

33:53.656 --> 33:54.824
Stay here.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.793
No, no, no, a larger one.

34:05.877 --> 34:06.961
Big as you can carry.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.644
Come on, you can do it.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.241
Done.

34:37.325 --> 34:41.079
Not quite. We need 26 more just like that.

34:41.162 --> 34:44.165
What Am I being punished?

34:44.248 --> 34:45.875
No, no, no. I'm just...

34:47.960 --> 34:51.339
I'm just trying to help you understand
that you have a responsibility now.

34:54.509 --> 34:58.012
This is about him. Isn't it?

35:00.723 --> 35:01.557
In a way.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.768
But I already know what I'm doing, Dad.

35:04.310 --> 35:09.065
I can control him. You saw.
He listens to me. He does what I say.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.900
Will, he is not a tool.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.319
I know. He's more than that.

35:16.239 --> 35:20.451
He's my friend.
He's there when I need him.

35:25.873 --> 35:30.294
But he wasn't always your friend, was he?

35:31.712 --> 35:32.713
No.

35:34.715 --> 35:37.927
As much as we'd all like
to change the past,

35:39.470 --> 35:42.181
undo our mistakes, we can't.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.394
We have to live with our history.

35:47.645 --> 35:53.734
So, in honor of that,
we're gonna place 27 stones here today.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.529
A cairn.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.825
A monument to all those
who lost their lives

36:00.908 --> 36:03.828
in the attack on the<i> Resolute.</i>

36:13.838 --> 36:18.885
You know, today, I...
I spoke to a woman named Angela.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.222
She lost her husband on the<i> Resolute.</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:29.437
This first one's for him.

36:36.152 --> 36:40.990
<i>In order to release the pain,</i>
<i>you have to acknowledge its source.</i>

36:43.784 --> 36:44.785
Okay.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.331
How do I do that?

36:48.414 --> 36:52.501
Words are a gateway
to your emotions.

36:53.085 --> 36:58.090
I want you to start by sharing
what you remember about that day.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.803
Well, like everyone else,

37:03.721 --> 37:06.724
when the alarm went off,
we had no idea what it was for.

37:07.308 --> 37:11.979
I remember Josh making jokes
so I wouldn't worry.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.067
Tell me about the moment
where you first encountered the machine.

37:21.781 --> 37:28.037
Outside the hangar,
there was panic, running, shoving.

37:29.997 --> 37:33.167
<i>At first, we thought </i>
<i>it's just the way people are.</i>

37:34.627 --> 37:37.380
<i>Trying to be the first ones</i>
<i>to reach their Jupiter.</i>

37:39.507 --> 37:42.760
<i>But then, we realized</i>

37:43.886 --> 37:46.806
<i>they weren't running toward something.</i>

37:48.099 --> 37:49.183
<i>They were running away.</i>

37:51.352 --> 37:56.899
That... thing was in there.

37:57.441 --> 38:02.989
Anyone who got in its path,
it just... eliminated.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.285
You're doing great, Angela.

38:09.704 --> 38:15.459
Now it's time to access
your sense memories.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.253
I want you to lie down...

38:18.921 --> 38:20.172
close your eyes.

38:28.306 --> 38:33.561
I want you to focus on the sounds...

38:36.355 --> 38:37.982
<i>the smells.</i>

38:38.899 --> 38:42.570
There's a strange metallic buzz,

38:44.071 --> 38:49.201
like something very close,
except it's everywhere.

38:51.954 --> 38:55.333
And then I smell burning.

38:57.126 --> 39:00.671
People burning.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.677
What do you see?

39:07.553 --> 39:09.889
Red. Emergency lighting.

39:09.972 --> 39:13.225
So, it was hard to make out where we were.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.562
Josh held my hand.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.567
We tried to skirt the perimeter
to our Jupiter.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.571
It was... It was so close.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.201
And then...

39:31.077 --> 39:32.578
he stopped.

39:34.705 --> 39:37.041
His body went rigid.

39:41.212 --> 39:47.343
He was hot, searing, white heat.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.972
I couldn't let go of his hand.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.351
It had burned into mine.

40:02.316 --> 40:05.694
I'm sorry.
Can we please not do this anymore?

40:08.322 --> 40:09.281
Of course.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.285
I think we've gone far enough
for this session.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.579
I thought talking about it
would make me feel better,

40:15.663 --> 40:19.083
but I feel worse.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.752
These things, they take time.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.754
What if we don't have time?

40:25.131 --> 40:28.134
Angela, I... I understand your anger...

40:29.552 --> 40:31.178
that this thing...

40:32.263 --> 40:38.060
that did this to your husband
is being welcomed among us.

40:38.853 --> 40:43.274
But what prevents people
from moving on from tragedy

40:44.733 --> 40:46.068
is a feeling...

40:47.695 --> 40:51.699
that there's something they could do
to change it.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.704
But there isn't. There simply isn't.

40:57.997 --> 41:01.375
All we can do is hope, pray...

41:02.626 --> 41:04.837
it doesn't happen to anyone else.

41:05.963 --> 41:10.050
What if there is something I could do?

41:12.261 --> 41:15.890
Something more than just hoping
and praying.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.350
I'm sorry, Angela,
but I'm gonna have to ask you

41:18.434 --> 41:21.645
to refrain from saying anything further
on this subject.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.482
Maybe I should go.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.820
We can pick it up tomorrow.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.324
You can't just make me relive all that
and then--

41:33.407 --> 41:35.910
I'm sorry. We can pick this up tomorrow.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.830
You can't just abandon me!

41:40.498 --> 41:42.041
Dr. Smith?

41:53.093 --> 41:56.013
Last one.
-Yeah.

41:56.096 --> 41:57.723
Let me give you a hand.

41:58.807 --> 41:59.642
No.

42:00.392 --> 42:01.894
-I, uh...

42:03.729 --> 42:04.939
I should do this one.

42:46.313 --> 42:49.066
Let's hope
we never have to add another one.

42:59.577 --> 43:00.995
All clear!

43:02.621 --> 43:04.123
So, we good?

43:05.416 --> 43:08.168
-Yeah.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.671
We're good
when we get the fuel safely back.

43:10.754 --> 43:11.964
What does that mean?

43:12.047 --> 43:14.717
It means you need to stop standing around
and start helping.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.385
How much longer?

43:16.468 --> 43:19.305
Once we start the transfer,
about three hours.

43:19.388 --> 43:21.890
Yeah, well, uh, let's try and make it two.

43:21.974 --> 43:25.978
Would you like me to change
the laws of physics, or just lie to you?

43:29.732 --> 43:31.191
Okay, everyone, listen up.

43:32.067 --> 43:35.154
In just three hours, we're gonna have
a tank full of liquid methane

43:35.237 --> 43:37.072
ready for transport. I...

43:40.451 --> 43:41.452
What is it?

43:41.827 --> 43:42.703
-Mmm.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.872
Yeah. I was just wondering
what we're gonna do

43:44.955 --> 43:48.083
when the Jupiter falls off the edge,
takes the fuel tank with it?

43:48.167 --> 43:50.044
Clearly we're hoping
that's not gonna happen.

43:50.127 --> 43:54.256
Oh, you can have all the hope you want,
but gravity may have other plans.

43:54.340 --> 43:58.969
You see, Vic, the west side of the Jupiter
is hanging over the edge.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.139
Now, the auxiliary fuel supply,
that's on the east side.

44:02.222 --> 44:05.434
As we transfer the fuel out,
the east side gets lighter.

44:05.809 --> 44:09.730
The weight shifts to the west side,
sending it over the edge.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.400
And since our hose
is connected to the tanker...

44:14.526 --> 44:18.530
Okay, so do you have a better idea?
Or do you want us to pay for that, too?

44:18.614 --> 44:20.366
We use the Chariots as an anchor.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.743
We dig down,
attach the towlines to the Jupiter.

44:22.826 --> 44:25.371
With the torque in the engines,
we counteract the shift in the weight.

44:25.454 --> 44:26.789
Hmm.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.917
It might. Just gotta get the right guy
behind the wheel.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.335
Or right girl.

44:31.919 --> 44:34.546
No offense,
but who do you expect to handle this?

44:34.963 --> 44:37.633
Somebody who saves lives
or somebody who gambles with them?

44:37.716 --> 44:40.427
No offense

44:42.471 --> 44:43.931
Don't let us down, Robinson.

45:01.281 --> 45:03.534
I'm sorry I kinda freaked out back there.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.244
It's pretty embarrassing.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.371
Oh, um...

45:08.914 --> 45:11.708
I almost forgot.
Everyone knows about the robot,

45:11.792 --> 45:14.795
so guess I don't need that anymore.

45:16.964 --> 45:17.840
Thanks.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.598
Don't worry about it. Back there.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.560
Everybody does embarrassing things
when they think they're gonna die.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.854
Yeah, well, not like me.

45:36.108 --> 45:38.193
Do you wanna know
why I didn't want you to see this?

45:40.195 --> 45:41.572
It's something I wrote...

45:43.615 --> 45:47.578
when our Jupiter was crashing
and I didn't think we were gonna make it.

45:55.711 --> 45:56.712
Read it. Really.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.481
It's a poem.

46:16.356 --> 46:20.360
Yeah, uh, a testimony.
In case anyone found our bodies.

46:21.069 --> 46:23.363
"If you find this message, do not weep. I have lived a life, I was not a creep.

46:26.283 --> 46:28.994
I did not like books, but loved my guitar.

46:29.077 --> 46:32.623
Brought my music to space
and traveled afar."

46:36.210 --> 46:38.795
-This is terrible.

46:39.505 --> 46:41.423
You try and rhyme
when you're hurtling to your death.

46:42.799 --> 46:46.386
"I am Vijay Dhar, aged 16 years.

46:46.470 --> 46:49.973
I loved free climbing
and I faced my fears.

46:50.682 --> 46:54.561
I once had vertigo, but then overcame it.

46:54.645 --> 47:00.234
Won a state-wide certificate
and my mom made me frame it."

47:00.692 --> 47:02.861
It's from the heart.

47:04.446 --> 47:09.535
"I have never been in love,
no girl broke this heart.

47:10.327 --> 47:13.997
Seems my life is over
before it could start.

47:15.082 --> 47:17.626
If you find this message,
please do not weep.

47:17.709 --> 47:21.380
I'm just a particle of space dust
you don't have to keep."

47:23.799 --> 47:27.177
I was gonna do the whole
"miles to go before I sleep" thing, but--

47:27.261 --> 47:28.428
Shut up.

47:49.533 --> 47:52.744
Can you tell me which direction
the Robinsons' Jupiter is from here?

47:52.828 --> 47:54.788
North. About half a mile.

47:55.956 --> 47:56.957
Thanks.

48:03.672 --> 48:06.174
Yeah, I do.

48:30.365 --> 48:32.117
How's your foot

48:32.200 --> 48:35.370
Not tired enough to keep me
from kicking your ass when this is over.

48:35.454 --> 48:36.663
Can't we just skip this?

48:36.747 --> 48:39.124
Go back to the part
where we're friends again?

48:39.916 --> 48:43.253
West, I don't know how much longer
these are going to hold.

48:43.337 --> 48:45.547
Go inside and tell Aiko
we need to disconnect now,

48:45.631 --> 48:46.590
while we still can.

48:46.673 --> 48:48.050
Aye, aye, Captain.

48:48.508 --> 48:49.718
We're not done yet.

48:49.801 --> 48:51.053
Pretty sure we are.

48:51.136 --> 48:52.095
West, let's go!

48:53.388 --> 48:54.723
You okay in there?

48:56.266 --> 48:58.018
Yeah. You?

48:58.101 --> 49:00.062
I'm not sure how much more I got.

49:00.145 --> 49:01.480
Engine's running high.

49:01.563 --> 49:04.191
Just hold on, okay?
Don's pulling everyone out.

49:09.571 --> 49:12.074
You guys almost done? We gotta go.
-Tapping out now.

49:12.532 --> 49:14.785
Every drop.

49:14.868 --> 49:16.453
Cool. See you topside.

49:16.536 --> 49:17.579
Yeah.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.923
-Ow!

50:35.365 --> 50:36.700
Son of a bitch.

50:37.284 --> 50:41.204
Let's go. Come on.
Let's go. Go, go.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.130
We're losing the Jupiter.
Prepare to detach.

50:50.213 --> 50:52.632
-We need to do it simultaneously.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.801
Judy, you won't believe what I found.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.554
Where are you?
<i>On my way out.</i>

50:57.637 --> 50:59.723
<i>Don, we can't hold it any longer.</i>
<i>Hurry up!</i>

51:01.057 --> 51:05.604
Detach on three. One, two...

51:05.687 --> 51:06.521
No! No!

51:06.605 --> 51:08.774
...three! Detach!

51:13.570 --> 51:14.821
Whoa!

51:14.905 --> 51:16.490
No, no, no!

51:24.331 --> 51:26.666
Detach!

51:27.250 --> 51:29.169
-Robinson!

51:29.252 --> 51:30.921
West is inside.

51:32.172 --> 51:33.340
Don, I can't hold it!

51:33.423 --> 51:35.425
-You need to detach now, Judy!
-No!

51:35.509 --> 51:36.510
Then I'll do it for you.

51:36.593 --> 51:37.636
Don, no--

52:05.163 --> 52:05.997
No.

52:07.958 --> 52:11.086
He detached it on his own.

52:15.048 --> 52:16.508
He sacrificed for all of us.

52:22.514 --> 52:26.059
Are you crazy?
I don't even like you guys.

52:27.018 --> 52:27.853
West?

52:32.983 --> 52:37.112
See, I knew she was too much
of a goody-goody to do it herself.

52:37.195 --> 52:42.576
And frankly, I was tired
of getting yelled at and blamed.

52:42.659 --> 52:47.455
I don't wanna have to be responsible
for the Chariot going over, so...

52:47.831 --> 52:48.748
Just gonna...

52:48.832 --> 52:51.209
But you were... How did... 'Cause I'm a badass, princess.

52:54.671 --> 52:57.883
You're a badass princess.

53:01.386 --> 53:04.306
No, no, no. There's a comma.

53:04.389 --> 53:07.058
-You know, "I'm a badass, comma, prince--"
Yeah.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.476
Yeah, whatever you say.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.687
Yeah, oh, you're welcome, by the way.

53:15.609 --> 53:16.818
Thank you.

53:41.343 --> 53:43.094
Oh, um... Hi, Mom.

53:43.178 --> 53:46.222
Hey. Where have you been?

53:46.598 --> 53:47.641
Just hanging out.

53:51.978 --> 53:53.063
Penny...

53:55.148 --> 53:56.149
He seems nice.

54:02.614 --> 54:05.951
<i>Mom, do you read? </i>
<i>Can you hear me</i>

54:08.078 --> 54:09.955
Yes, Judy, hi. Go ahead.

54:10.038 --> 54:12.874
<i>We got it, Mom. We got the fuel.</i>
<i>All of it.</i>

54:14.292 --> 54:17.504
<i>Mom <i>Mom</i></i>

54:17.587 --> 54:20.173
Yes, yes. I'm... I'm...

54:21.299 --> 54:23.301
I'm good. I'm wonderful, actually.

54:23.802 --> 54:25.720
<i>Okay. Victor thinks it's too late</i>
<i>to trek home,</i>

54:25.804 --> 54:28.265
<i>so we're gonna spend the night.</i>
<i>I just wanted to let you know.</i>

54:28.348 --> 54:30.350
Okay. Just get back safe.

54:31.017 --> 54:33.436
<i>I will. I love you.</i>

54:35.021 --> 54:36.731
I love you, too, honey.

54:38.692 --> 54:42.237
Judy... great job.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.492
<i>Thanks, Mom. Bye.</i>

54:56.209 --> 54:57.043
What is it?

54:58.336 --> 54:59.546
We're gonna be okay.

55:02.465 --> 55:05.552
Four, four, four.

55:05.844 --> 55:09.848
Five, five, five. Five. Okay.

55:09.931 --> 55:13.226
So, what you're trying to do is,
you're trying to make pairs.

55:13.310 --> 55:16.938
So you have to ask the other players
if they have any of the cards you need.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.490
Seriously

55:27.574 --> 55:30.452
I am so sorry
that I have excellent peripheral vision.

55:31.286 --> 55:33.705
Hey, Smith, should we deal you in?

55:33.788 --> 55:35.832
No, thank you.

55:41.087 --> 55:42.172
You got an eight?

55:46.259 --> 55:48.094
Do you have--

55:48.178 --> 55:49.387
Uh, Will.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.639
Why don't you ask your mom to join?

55:52.682 --> 55:55.769
She's busy.
Said she had to do some calculations.

55:55.852 --> 55:58.563
The fuel doesn't get here
till tomorrow afternoon.

55:58.897 --> 56:03.276
And when does she ever have the time
to just sit and play with you guys?

56:10.533 --> 56:12.202
Okay, I'll go ask her.

56:13.661 --> 56:16.456
Hey, don't worry. He'll be back.

56:21.795 --> 56:23.463
I've never seen him make that face before.

56:24.672 --> 56:27.967
-It looks like he's smiling.

56:41.523 --> 56:44.734
Hey, Angela. What can I do for you?

56:53.618 --> 56:55.578
Why don't we go talk outside?

56:58.540 --> 57:00.583
I have no quarrel with you,
Mr. Robinson.

57:00.667 --> 57:03.837
You're doing what you think is best
to protect your family.

57:05.672 --> 57:10.635
I'm happy to discuss this with you,
after my daughter has left the room.

57:10.718 --> 57:12.846
Dad, no.

57:12.929 --> 57:14.097
Angela...

57:16.307 --> 57:18.184
put the weapon down.

57:18.726 --> 57:20.728
That's exactly why I'm here.

57:24.023 --> 57:27.569
To put the weapon down.

57:27.652 --> 57:31.448
Robot, leave the Jupiter.

57:35.285 --> 57:36.619
Mom.

57:38.413 --> 57:40.290
We're all playing Go Fish.
You wanna come?

57:41.166 --> 57:43.376
Oh, honey, I'd love to but I've got to...

57:44.752 --> 57:45.879
You know what? I'd love to.

57:46.629 --> 57:48.006
Great, I'll deal ya.

57:58.099 --> 58:01.811
Will! Will, don't go in there!

58:03.062 --> 58:04.063
<i>Will!</i>

58:32.342 --> 58:33.176
No!

58:58.535 --> 59:01.913
A very hard head
is one of your dad's finest qualities.

59:04.874 --> 59:06.376
He'll be all right.

59:06.793 --> 59:09.462
Judy will check in on him
when she gets back tomorrow.

59:10.338 --> 59:11.923
He just needs some rest.

59:42.829 --> 59:43.830
Come on.

59:48.209 --> 59:52.005
<i>I don't know who she is,</i>
<i>but she's not Dr. Smith.</i>

59:53.256 --> 59:56.301
I had even more proof in my hand.

59:56.384 --> 1:00:00.013
Photographs, diplomas.
Pictures of the man with his family.

1:00:00.096 --> 1:00:01.389
Wearing the St. Christopher necklace.

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:03.808
-So why would she--
-I don't know.

1:00:03.891 --> 1:00:05.018
But one thing's for damn sure.

1:00:05.101 --> 1:00:07.895
You don't go through this much trouble
unless you have something to hide.

1:00:14.444 --> 1:00:16.237
Don't worry, Angela.

1:00:17.947 --> 1:00:20.658
No one will blame you for what happened.

1:00:21.534 --> 1:00:23.536
It's all gonna work out fine.

1:00:42.388 --> 1:00:43.473
Hey.

1:00:44.599 --> 1:00:46.517
What happened?

1:00:48.561 --> 1:00:50.438
It's okay. Everything's okay.

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:54.734
Where's Will?

1:01:26.265 --> 1:01:27.975
You're the best friend I ever had.

1:01:30.395 --> 1:01:34.023
You know that, right?

1:01:52.667 --> 1:01:54.669
I have to be responsible for you.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:01.175
Step forward.
