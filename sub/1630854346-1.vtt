WEBVTT

00:39.281 --> 00:40.537
<i>So you're asking her tonight?</i>

00:40.672 --> 00:42.342
Yeah. Any advice?

00:42.478 --> 00:43.942
Go for the grand gesture.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.446
I used to do stuff like that
all the time.

00:46.581 --> 00:47.711
He never did anything like that.

00:47.846 --> 00:49.154
It was totally out of character.

00:49.290 --> 00:50.619
40,000. Do I have 45?

00:50.754 --> 00:53.852
Actually,
David's proposal was probably

00:53.987 --> 00:56.120
the only time
he ever surprised me.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.123
- We dated all four years
she was in college.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.365
I had a spot in the master's
program for architecture,

01:00.500 --> 01:02.893
so I was definitely staying
in Chicago.

01:03.029 --> 01:04.568
Then out of nowhere,
I get an offer

01:04.704 --> 01:06.838
-from a great gallery in L.A.
-- 70,000?

01:06.973 --> 01:09.174
-70.
-70,000.

01:09.310 --> 01:10.737
So, the night before
graduation...

01:10.873 --> 01:12.639
...and she springs it on me
she's leaving.

01:12.775 --> 01:15.048
And I'm calm.
You know, happy for her.

01:15.184 --> 01:17.250
<i>He freaks out completely.</i>

01:18.287 --> 01:21.178
So, the next morning,
at the ceremony,

01:21.313 --> 01:24.418
I'm up there walking towards
the dean and my diploma,

01:24.553 --> 01:27.886
and suddenly, there's David,

01:28.021 --> 01:30.324
right next to me,
down on one knee.

01:30.459 --> 01:32.523
And she starts crying.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.899
I'm so embarrassed.

01:35.035 --> 01:36.234
The whole place erupts.

01:36.370 --> 01:37.931
Everybody's clapping
and shouting.

01:38.066 --> 01:40.039
Except her parents.
They thought she was too young.

01:40.174 --> 01:41.504
They thought I could do better.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.238
But who ever listens
to their parents?

01:44.374 --> 01:46.213
Sold to Georgia Cotton.

01:48.373 --> 01:51.615
Long story short,
she didn't move to California,

01:51.750 --> 01:53.711
and a month later,
we were pregnant with Lily.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.117
That's amazing.

01:55.253 --> 01:56.514
Wait, how long ago?

01:56.650 --> 01:59.453
Uh, let me do the math.

01:59.589 --> 02:02.524
March 7th, it'll be 25 years.

02:02.660 --> 02:04.623
Incredible.
25 years of marriage.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.931
Oh, God. We're not married.

02:07.066 --> 02:08.862
God, no.

02:08.997 --> 02:11.469
We divorced five years later.

02:11.605 --> 02:13.640
And it's not one of those
amicable divorces

02:13.776 --> 02:15.442
you see on TV.

02:15.578 --> 02:17.640
I try not to be in the same
time zone if I can help it,

02:17.775 --> 02:19.979
but Lily's graduating tomorrow,
so here I am.

02:20.115 --> 02:21.573
Wow, that's got to be awkward.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.476
What? No. Ancient history.

02:23.612 --> 02:24.775
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

02:24.910 --> 02:26.785
Nightmare.

02:26.921 --> 02:28.552
Check, please.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.217
What are you doing?

02:35.220 --> 02:37.162
-I'm packing.
-You're packing work.

02:37.297 --> 02:38.589
-Don't pack work.

02:38.725 --> 02:39.999
Why would you pack work?

02:40.135 --> 02:41.264
Because it's a short vacation

02:41.399 --> 02:42.564
and a very long life afterwards.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.796
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.338
and I really don't think
this whole

02:45.474 --> 02:47.268
"being an adult" thing
is gonna work out for me.

02:49.072 --> 02:52.107
Yeah, well,
I don't really have a choice.

02:52.242 --> 02:53.310
Hey, Mom.

02:53.445 --> 02:55.281
So I'm just steaming my outfit,

02:55.416 --> 02:57.447
and I am wondering
where I'm sitting.

02:57.583 --> 02:59.749
Not that it matters.
To me, I mean.

02:59.884 --> 03:01.780
Just... I mean, it doesn't
matter to me at all.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.189
Then why did you...

03:03.324 --> 03:05.292
-Oh, hang on. It's Dad.

03:06.822 --> 03:08.955
Hey, Dad.
Mom's on the other line.

03:09.091 --> 03:10.790
-- Don't say hi from me.

03:10.926 --> 03:12.364
You're not sitting together,
okay?

03:12.500 --> 03:13.958
You're on opposite sides
of the auditorium,

03:14.094 --> 03:15.528
which is the size
of Rhode Island.

03:15.664 --> 03:17.165
That's the smallest state.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.198
So you promise?

03:20.333 --> 03:24.202
No mean comments, no arguing,
no passive aggression?

03:24.337 --> 03:26.809
What about aggressive
aggression? Is that okay?

03:26.944 --> 03:29.580
-I love you.
-- I love you.

03:30.617 --> 03:32.981
This is gonna be
an unbearable day.

03:33.117 --> 03:34.553
Come on.

03:34.688 --> 03:36.880
We shake an old guy's hand
and wear a dumb hat.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.618
What could possibly go wrong?

03:39.754 --> 03:41.718
They're sitting together.

03:46.362 --> 03:47.530
Good afternoon.

03:47.666 --> 03:49.361
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:49.496 --> 03:52.839
On behalf of the faculty and
staff of Pullman University...

03:52.975 --> 03:54.407
-Big day.
-Yeah.

03:54.542 --> 03:57.036
...it is my privilege
to welcome the parents,

03:57.172 --> 04:00.078
family and friends
of our graduating seniors.

04:00.214 --> 04:01.882
You got to be kidding me.

04:02.017 --> 04:03.407
Guess this is my seat,

04:03.542 --> 04:05.814
as you haven't had a date
since Lily was in braces.

04:05.949 --> 04:07.883
At least when I do date,
it's age-appropriate.

04:08.019 --> 04:11.154
You just don't
like him because he's French.

04:11.289 --> 04:12.718
I like the French.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.257
I like their fries, their toast.

04:14.393 --> 04:15.691
I specifically asked Lily

04:15.827 --> 04:17.188
-not to seat us together.
-Their mustard.

04:17.323 --> 04:18.495
What? You called her?
That's so pathetic.

04:18.631 --> 04:19.823
-Shh. It's starting.
-Don't shush me.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.501
-Shh.
-Don't shush me.

04:21.636 --> 04:25.699
So, without further ado,
let's begin the roll call.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.036
-Wren Butler.

04:28.172 --> 04:29.838
Yes!

04:30.878 --> 04:32.808
Wrenny!

04:37.215 --> 04:38.781
Excuse me.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.920
-That's my armrest.
-No, it's in the middle.

04:41.056 --> 04:42.389
Oh, this is so like you.

04:42.524 --> 04:43.917
-Take, take, take.
-It is not a metaphor.

04:44.053 --> 04:45.524
-It is an armrest.
-- Wilson Chang.

04:45.659 --> 04:47.861
Give me half, please.
I would like half.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.056
Just give me half.

04:51.192 --> 04:52.364
What is wrong with you?
I just want half!

04:52.499 --> 04:54.592
-- Lily Cotton.
-Oh. Hey.

04:57.901 --> 04:59.396
-Take a picture.
-You take a picture.

04:59.531 --> 05:01.131
-I'm in the moment.
-Why do you need a picture?

05:01.267 --> 05:03.135
-So I don't forget the moment.
-Ah.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.538
-- Love you.
-- Love you more.

05:04.674 --> 05:06.303
-So proud.
-Prouder.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.881
-- The most proud.
-- Proudest.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.277
Couldn't be more proud.

05:09.412 --> 05:10.713
Bursting.

05:10.849 --> 05:12.978
-She got my nose.
-- Yeah. Yeah.

05:13.114 --> 05:15.213
You're welcome, honey.
Love you, Lily.

05:16.855 --> 05:18.550
- I can't believe
my baby's a lawyer.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.117
You and me both.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.756
Can everyone
please stop shouting?

05:21.892 --> 05:23.928
-Who's shouting?
-There you go again.

05:24.063 --> 05:26.999
Some of us maybe had seven
too many Jägerbombs last night.

05:27.134 --> 05:28.563
Just one too many.

05:28.699 --> 05:31.061
The other six were perfection.

05:31.196 --> 05:33.132
Well, it's a long flight
to Bali.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.735
-You can sleep on the plane.

05:35.870 --> 05:38.069
Lily can work on the plane.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.474
She had at least 90 hours

05:39.610 --> 05:41.171
of exams in the last week.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.812
Well, in the next three months,

05:42.947 --> 05:44.748
she starts at the top
law firm in Chicago.

05:44.883 --> 05:47.478
You can't show up to a gunfight
with a tan.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.850
Okay, she needs to decompress,
and you need to calm down.

05:49.986 --> 05:51.457
You know telling someone
to calm down

05:51.593 --> 05:53.160
has literally never
calmed anyone down

05:53.295 --> 05:54.491
in the history of the universe?

05:54.626 --> 05:56.161
-I know that.
-You know that?

05:56.296 --> 05:57.491
Inside voices, please.

05:57.626 --> 05:58.925
I'm taking briefs.

05:59.061 --> 06:00.797
I'm taking sunblock.
I'll be fine.

06:00.932 --> 06:02.632
You know, for once,
you could back me up.

06:02.768 --> 06:04.498
I could, but then
I'd be wrong, too.

06:04.634 --> 06:06.166
Ugh. Okay, we should go.

06:06.302 --> 06:08.173
Oh. Do you see what you did?
You blew the goodbye.

06:08.309 --> 06:09.338
-I did that?
-Uh-huh.

06:09.474 --> 06:11.443
It wasn't just him. Bye.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.707
-See, it wasn't just me.
-I love you.

06:13.842 --> 06:15.439
-Hey. Bye.
-Bye, Dad.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.983
DAVID and- Bye, bye,
bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

06:18.417 --> 06:20.048
Bye, Lily's dad and mom.

06:20.183 --> 06:22.984
'Cause my dad and mom
don't even know I'm going.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.354
I love you. Be safe.

06:25.489 --> 06:26.550
Make good choices.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.294
Always.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.464
-Rarely.

06:31.497 --> 06:32.994
And she's gone.

06:33.993 --> 06:35.529
See you again never.

06:35.665 --> 06:37.330
Hopefully not that soon.

07:46.575 --> 07:48.471
-Who can ever really tell?
-Okay.

07:48.606 --> 07:51.207
Uh, let's go. Come on.

-What?

07:57.049 --> 07:59.716
If we don't make it,
I love you like a sister.

07:59.852 --> 08:01.415
Don't talk.
Conserve your energy.

08:01.550 --> 08:03.618
Okay.

08:03.753 --> 08:05.315
You hate your sister.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.823
Yeah. I love you
like how a person

08:07.959 --> 08:09.563
is supposed to love
their sister,

08:09.698 --> 08:12.192
like, if their sister wasn't
a total bitch.

08:21.771 --> 08:24.545
See? It's gonna be okay.

08:26.614 --> 08:29.275
All I see is one
superhot boat guy.

08:35.888 --> 08:37.783
You're a long way out
for a swim.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.491
The boat forgot us.

08:40.626 --> 08:42.755
How could they forget about you?

08:42.891 --> 08:45.159
That's what I'm saying.

08:46.930 --> 08:48.433
-Careful.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.861
Got you. I got you.

08:50.996 --> 08:52.697

08:52.832 --> 08:54.773
Yeah.

08:56.507 --> 08:58.172

08:59.447 --> 09:01.377
Well, pleased to meet you, Lily.

I'm a lawyer.

09:36.475 --> 09:38.711

-Here.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.687
Don't you?

09:44.822 --> 09:47.386
Uh, I don't know. I just...

09:47.522 --> 09:49.388
I mean, my whole life,
I've been working towards

09:49.524 --> 09:53.094

For a while?

28:04.481 --> 28:06.055
Well, nothing lasts forever.

28:07.054 --> 28:08.785
Marriage is supposed to.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.455
That's what I thought till I
was sitting across from Georgia

28:11.591 --> 28:14.793

dividing up our stuff.

28:14.928 --> 28:17.759
So, enjoy this.

28:17.895 --> 28:20.639
Right up until the minute
that Lily ends it,

28:20.774 --> 28:23.607
which she will
because she's ambitious

28:23.742 --> 28:25.435
and she's endlessly curious.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.272
And as beautiful
as this island is,

28:27.407 --> 28:31.146
and as pleasant
as you seem to be,

28:31.281 --> 28:33.412
ultimately,
it's just not gonna be enough.

28:35.183 --> 28:37.483
Bit of advice: Don't have kids.

28:37.619 --> 28:39.821
Makes it much more complicated
when she takes them

28:39.956 --> 28:41.959
and she goes back to the States.

28:44.630 --> 28:47.160
I'm hungry. You hungry?

28:47.295 --> 28:48.667
Yeah, let's get
something to eat.

28:48.803 --> 28:50.836

-Or not.
-And how proud we are...

29:30.843 --> 29:32.535
Gede is having second thoughts.

29:32.671 --> 29:34.107
I saw the two of you.
What happened?

29:34.243 --> 29:36.741
I initiated phase two.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.243
We get out of the Trojan horse.
We start killing people.

29:39.379 --> 29:41.720
We are nowhere near phase two.

29:41.855 --> 29:43.346
Maybe you're at
a different party,

29:43.481 --> 29:44.921
but from where I'm sitting,

29:45.057 --> 29:47.024
we're about to inherit
150 new in-laws.

29:47.159 --> 29:49.224
Oh, God. You only ever
see things your own way.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.028
Everybody only ever sees
anything their own way.

29:51.163 --> 29:52.860
Explains why you walked out
on me and Lily.

29:52.996 --> 29:54.400
I didn't walk out on Lily.

29:54.535 --> 29:57.760
<i>Desa, kala, patra.</i>

29:57.895 --> 30:02.134

it must to be right place.

It must to be the right time.

30:05.209 --> 30:07.374
It must to be
the right circumstance.

30:07.509 --> 30:08.810
I wish someone had have
explained that to us.

30:08.945 --> 30:11.109
We were oh for three.

30:11.245 --> 30:12.647
-One for three.
-Hmm?

30:12.783 --> 30:14.279
One for three.

30:14.414 --> 30:16.288
Wrong circumstance, wrong time.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.455
Right place.

30:18.590 --> 30:20.451
By the lake.

30:20.587 --> 30:24.726
So I announce that Gede
will marry Lily

30:24.862 --> 30:26.490
in four days' time,

30:26.626 --> 30:30.133

talking about by the beach?

31:18.778 --> 31:21.580
Seaweed, mostly.
He had a lot of questions.

31:23.648 --> 31:25.819
-He loves you.

31:25.955 --> 31:27.986
He loves you.

31:28.122 --> 31:30.391

32:07.529 --> 32:09.358
Do you know anybody
that snores less

32:09.494 --> 32:10.893
when they get older?

32:11.028 --> 32:12.904
I'm gonna be listening
to you all night,

32:13.040 --> 32:15.304
I'm gonna do it
from the better room.

32:16.538 --> 32:18.602
You know you used to do
sleep karate?

32:18.738 --> 32:20.373
You'd fling yourself
around the bed

32:20.509 --> 32:22.172
-like you were attacking it.
-Mm.

32:22.307 --> 32:23.772
I wasn't asleep.

32:23.908 --> 32:26.414
-I was attacking you.
-There you go.

32:27.888 --> 32:29.181
Try to keep the snoring down.

32:29.316 --> 32:30.781
I have a nasal strip.

32:30.916 --> 32:33.520
- It's a mystery
you're still alone.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.648
Can I get another one of these?

33:04.784 --> 33:07.389
I'll have two
of whatever he's having.

33:08.590 --> 33:10.720
Hello, Wren.
What are you doing here?

33:10.856 --> 33:12.329
Unlike your daughter,
I've never been

33:12.464 --> 33:14.757
a "thatched hut with
a dirt floor" kind of gal.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.759
-Mm.
-I've got a nicely appointed

33:16.894 --> 33:18.961
-broom closet here.
-Good for you.

33:20.802 --> 33:23.401
You know, I blame you
for this whole shit show.

33:23.536 --> 33:25.411
That's what you think of it?

33:25.546 --> 33:26.841
You don't?

33:26.977 --> 33:28.837
Lily's happy.

33:28.973 --> 33:30.974
And after four years
of watching her

33:31.109 --> 33:34.345
beat herself up at college,
I love to see that.

33:34.481 --> 33:35.984
I thought you might, too.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.022
Hey, look, happy is great.

33:38.158 --> 33:40.350
Lily happy is
the greatest of all.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.821
It's just that...

33:42.956 --> 33:45.521
a weird thing happens
when you become a parent.

33:45.656 --> 33:47.527
When your kid is down,

33:47.662 --> 33:50.697
when they're in pain,
it kills you.

33:50.832 --> 33:54.599
But when they're up,
when things are going great,

33:54.734 --> 33:56.668
that's when you get
really scared.

33:56.803 --> 33:59.172
Because you don't want it
to change,

33:59.307 --> 34:01.436
and you know it will.

34:01.571 --> 34:03.482
Does it always?

34:06.685 --> 34:08.213
Mm.

34:08.349 --> 34:10.351
Lily's never said--

34:10.487 --> 34:12.717
what happened
with you and Mrs. C?

34:12.853 --> 34:16.126
Same thing that happens
in every relationship.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.856
When it started out,
it was unreal.

34:20.527 --> 34:23.630
Then it got real.

34:31.202 --> 34:34.912
We used to bike out
to this place by the lake.

34:35.048 --> 34:37.611
You know, read, eat, whatever.

34:39.011 --> 34:40.817
And then one day,
I saw that that place,

34:40.953 --> 34:43.153
that spot was for sale.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.981
Now, we were young.
We had nothing.

34:45.116 --> 34:48.260
But I said,
"Someday we should live here."

34:48.395 --> 34:53.363
And then she said,
with that smile in her voice...

34:55.193 --> 34:57.928
"Why wait? Why save
the good stuff for later?

34:58.064 --> 35:01.563
Don't we deserve
some good stuff along the way?"

35:01.698 --> 35:03.934
Ah, she was right.

35:04.069 --> 35:07.674
-Which happens occasionally.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.448
Uh...

35:11.583 --> 35:13.747
we saved and we scrambled,
and next thing you know,

35:13.883 --> 35:16.881
I'm building the perfect house
in the perfect spot.

35:21.858 --> 35:25.028
So, I was busy. I was working,
paying off our debt.

35:25.163 --> 35:27.199
I was tired. She was tired.

35:29.028 --> 35:30.933
Then, pretty soon,
it didn't feel like

35:31.069 --> 35:33.728
we were married at all.

35:33.864 --> 35:37.101
Just felt like we were...

35:37.237 --> 35:40.872
running a day care camp with
someone we used to go out with.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.614
We were sniping,
we were fighting,

35:45.749 --> 35:47.481
we were tearing each other
down, and I thought,

35:47.616 --> 35:52.086
if I could just get her
in that house,

35:52.222 --> 35:54.226
it'd fix everything.

35:56.226 --> 35:58.230

36:01.133 --> 36:03.960
So, one night, I get a call

36:04.096 --> 36:07.271
from the people
who lived across the lake.

36:07.406 --> 36:10.209
They said they'd seen
these flames.

36:16.140 --> 36:20.219
By the time I got there,
it was just ash.

36:23.947 --> 36:26.885
Three weeks later, we were done.

36:29.291 --> 36:30.724
Over a house?

36:31.760 --> 36:33.793

-No, we changed rooms.

-It's a much better room.

56:45.510 --> 56:47.203

we could visit

57:34.517 --> 57:35.789
