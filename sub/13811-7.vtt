Tito: We're going to go
around the corner.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.191
Whoever breaks the conga line
buys shakes for everybody!

01:06.274 --> 01:07.317
(<i> laughing</i> )

01:09.569 --> 01:10.153
Whoa!

01:10.236 --> 01:12.655
(<i> laughing</i> )

01:12.739 --> 01:14.616
Guess the shakes are on me!

01:14.699 --> 01:15.867
{\an1}Yeah, let's go!
Shakes!

01:15.950 --> 01:17.494
All right!
Let's do this!

01:17.577 --> 01:18.411
Yeah,
all right!

01:18.495 --> 01:19.788
{\an1}Do fries come
with that shake?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.539
Reggie, Otto, hang on.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.375
I'm going to the annual Surf Wax
convention in San Diego,

01:24.459 --> 01:26.461
so I'll be out of town
all weekend.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.546
{\an1}Aah, no!

01:28.630 --> 01:31.132
{\an1}We've got to stay
with the Stimpletons?

01:31.216 --> 01:31.925
All weekend?

01:32.008 --> 01:34.219
It's only a couple of days.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.512
Tito: You know,
brother,

01:35.595 --> 01:36.721
I don't have plans.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.014
I could stay with
the little cuzzes

01:38.097 --> 01:39.182
for the weekend.

01:39.265 --> 01:39.849
{\an5}Yeah,
how about Tito?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.851
Can he, Raymundo?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.394
{\an1}Are you sure,
Tito?

01:43.478 --> 01:48.233
{\an3}As sure as the sun shines on
Waikiki. It would be an honor.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.318
Well, okay.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.362
Yeah, thanks,
Raymundo!

01:52.445 --> 01:53.822
Both:
Go, Tito! It's your birthday...

01:53.905 --> 01:56.825
Go, me! Go, me! Whoa!

01:56.908 --> 02:01.454
{\an5}(<i> laughing</i> )
We're going to have

(<i> laughing</i> )

02:12.131 --> 02:14.634
Get ready for
the raddest weekend ever!

02:18.972 --> 02:20.056
No rules...

02:20.139 --> 02:20.974
{\an1}no chores,

02:21.057 --> 02:23.893
{\an1}just Tito
all the time!

02:23.977 --> 02:26.896
We can do whatever we want!

02:27.897 --> 02:29.732
Like the Madtown
Sunday-night skate.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.860
Yeah!

02:29.816 --> 02:31.860
Yeah!

02:31.943 --> 02:33.319
Did you ask Raymundo
if you guys could go?

02:33.403 --> 02:37.574
Raymundo's not going
to be here, Tito is.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.908
So let's get ready for...

02:38.992 --> 02:42.829
(<i> echoing</i> )
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

02:42.912 --> 02:44.914
Ray:
Here's the hotel I'm staying at,

02:44.998 --> 02:46.624
and I put all the
emergency numbers

02:46.708 --> 02:48.376
{\an1}by the phone
in the kitchen.

02:48.459 --> 02:48.751
Got it, brother.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.086
{\an1}Okay.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.922
{\an1}Well, I guess
that's it, then.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.757
You guys have a good weekend.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.593
We will, brother.

02:56.676 --> 02:57.552
{\an1}We will.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.928
Later, Raymundo.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.805
{\an4}Have a
good time.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.805
Have a
good time.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.809
Remember to get plenty of rest.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.812
(<i> tires screeching</i> )

03:07.896 --> 03:09.606
Oh, and brush after meals.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.441
Do your chores,
and be careful.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.192
And don't surf
near the point,

03:13.276 --> 03:14.444
and make sure you wear your
helmets whenever --

03:14.527 --> 03:16.571
Stop worrying, Raymundo.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.739
Tito's going to
take good care of us.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.657
Right, Tito?

03:19.741 --> 03:20.950
That's right.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.994
It'll be just like
you never left.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.538
Nothing going to happen
to my little cuzzes.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.292
(<i> tires squealing</i> )

03:29.375 --> 03:32.754
{\an1}Later, Tito, we're going
to catch a few waves.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.172
Sounds good.

03:34.255 --> 03:38.676
And here, in case you need me,
I'm just a phone call away.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.928
Cool, a cellphone.

03:40.011 --> 03:40.762
Wow!
Thanks, Tito!

03:40.845 --> 03:42.305
See you later!

03:45.850 --> 03:49.854
This rocks!
Tito fully trusts us!

03:49.938 --> 03:52.774
{\an1}No questions, no nagging,
just a cellphone --

03:52.857 --> 03:55.318
total freedom, yeah!

03:55.401 --> 03:58.613
(<i> cellphone ringing</i> )

03:58.696 --> 03:59.822
{\an1}Hello?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.908
Tito: <i> Hi, it's me.</i>

04:01.991 --> 04:03.284
{\an1}(<i> whispering</i> )
It's Tito.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.330
(<i> shouting</i> )
I wanted to make sure it worked!

04:15.088 --> 04:17.507
Surf is raging at the point.

04:17.589 --> 04:18.341
Let's go for it!

04:18.423 --> 04:21.427
(<i> cellphone ringing</i> )

04:21.511 --> 04:22.428
Hello?

04:22.512 --> 04:23.930
Tito:
<i>Aloha, little cuzzes.</i>

04:24.013 --> 04:26.182
<i>Just wanted to tell you to have</i>
<i>a big time surfing.</i>

04:26.265 --> 04:28.643
<i>Oh, and remember</i>
<i>to stay away from the point.</i>

04:28.726 --> 04:30.186
What?

04:30.269 --> 04:33.022
But, Tito, the waves
are cranking out there!

04:33.106 --> 04:36.025
{\an5}Tito:
<i>The waves are plenty cranking</i>
<i>right where you are.</i>

04:36.109 --> 04:37.193
{\an5}Right where we are?

04:37.276 --> 04:39.195
But how do you...

04:39.278 --> 04:40.321
(<i> shouting</i> )
Catch a few for me!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.201
(<i> grunting</i> )

04:48.037 --> 04:49.706
Catch a few for him where?

04:49.789 --> 04:50.665
{\an1}It's a full-on
shoobie high tide!

04:50.748 --> 04:52.625
{\an3}Come on!

04:52.709 --> 04:54.168
How bad can it be?

04:54.252 --> 04:56.879
(<i> screaming,</i>
<i>grunting</i> )

04:59.132 --> 05:02.385
(<i> detector clicking</i> )

05:04.345 --> 05:06.222
That was weak.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.725
I caught like
two waves all day.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.935
{\an1}I'm sure Tito will
let us do it tomorrow.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.895
{\an1}He was just being careful
on the first day,

05:12.979 --> 05:13.896
but he'll loosen up.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.733
Yeah, maybe he'll
come with us.

05:16.816 --> 05:17.984
Tito:
Hey, cuzzes!

05:18.067 --> 05:20.028
I hope you got
some energy left

05:20.111 --> 05:22.238
because Uncle Tito got
a big night planned

05:22.322 --> 05:22.613
for the little cuzzes.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.115
Killer!

05:24.198 --> 05:26.617
Can Sam and Twister
hang, too?

05:26.701 --> 05:30.079
Sure, it'll be
a big luau party --

05:30.163 --> 05:31.247
all the munchies and dessert
you can eat

05:31.330 --> 05:34.959
and all the movies
you can watch!

05:45.595 --> 05:48.723
{\an1}Eat up! Everybody in Hawaii
loves this stuff!

05:48.806 --> 05:51.059
It's <i> 'opihi.</i>

05:51.142 --> 05:54.145
Mmm-mmm, raw barnacles.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.522
(<i> slurping</i> )

05:56.606 --> 05:59.358
{\an1}Looks great, but what
about the hula burgers?

05:59.442 --> 06:01.110
And the shore shakes?

06:01.194 --> 06:01.944
Yeah, I thought
we were having

06:02.028 --> 06:04.113
a party-luau thing?

06:05.323 --> 06:07.950
{\an4}That is luau --
taro leaves boiled
in goat milk.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.619
It's tasty on your tummy.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.579
{\an1}Go ahead.

06:11.662 --> 06:12.747
(<i> bell dings</i> )

06:12.830 --> 06:13.706
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

06:13.790 --> 06:14.415
The dessert is ready!

06:14.499 --> 06:15.708
Deep-fried guava root.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.796
Eat up, there's plenty more
where that came from!

06:19.879 --> 06:21.339
All:
Whew.

Man: <i> And that's why sugar cane</i>
<i>is our friend.</i>

06:30.056 --> 06:32.683
<i>Aloha for now!</i>

06:36.020 --> 06:39.023
Oh, the end always gets me.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.650
(<i> sniffling</i> )

06:40.733 --> 06:41.984
{\an1}(<i> whispering</i> )
Hey...

06:42.068 --> 06:44.487
{\an4}what happened to
the monster movies
you rented?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.447
He won't let us
watch them.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.741
{\an1}He says they'll give us
nightmares.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.243
Tito:
Come on, little cuzzes!

06:50.326 --> 06:52.161
Time to swivel the hips.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.830
(<i> Hawaiian music playing</i> )

06:58.918 --> 07:03.005
I got us "Hula For Haoles,"
part one, two, and three.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.133
Is this a party or what?

07:05.216 --> 07:08.511
{\an1}(<i> whispering</i> )
"Or what."

07:09.554 --> 07:11.430
Man, the whacked food

07:11.514 --> 07:13.558
the rules, the movies!

07:13.641 --> 07:15.351
He made us hula.

07:15.434 --> 07:18.729
{\an1}Tito has gone totally,
intensely, epically lame!

07:18.813 --> 07:21.524
Come on, Otto,
it wasn't that bad.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.192
And besides, we're going
mountain biking tomorrow.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.694
We won't see him all day.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.029
{\an1}Yeah.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.699
And then straight to Madtown
for the Sunday-night skate!

07:29.782 --> 07:32.660
We are Tito-free
from now till then.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.329
Otto: Hi, Tito!
Bye, Tito!

07:35.413 --> 07:37.331
{\an5}We're meeting
the guys

07:37.415 --> 07:39.083
for some
mountain biking.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.710
{\an3}Tito: Sounds great,
little cuzzes...

07:40.793 --> 07:42.962
right after you
clean your rooms.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.088
Clean our rooms?

07:44.172 --> 07:45.965
Ray says Sunday is cleaning day

07:46.048 --> 07:48.676
but there'll be plenty of time
for bikes after.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.720
You can stay out
till 4:00 if you want.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.222
{\an1}4:00?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.099
But it doesn't get
dark till 6:00.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.351
That's right. Can't have
my little cuzzes

07:57.435 --> 07:58.895
riding around after dark.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.313
Something might happen.

08:10.489 --> 08:13.784
I can't believe how long
all that cleaning took.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.119
The whole day is burned.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.539
{\an5}Well, what about
the night skate
tonight at Madtown?

08:18.623 --> 08:19.999
Well, we haven't
asked Tito yet, but...

08:20.082 --> 08:21.250
Why bother?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.252
You know he's not
going to let us.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.298
That's it --
we don't ask him!

08:27.381 --> 08:28.799
Huh?

08:27.381 --> 08:28.799
{\an1}Huh?

08:28.883 --> 08:32.303
If we don't ask him,
he can't say no.

08:32.385 --> 08:35.264
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

08:35.347 --> 08:36.515
{\an1}Yeah!

08:36.599 --> 08:37.933
Wait, what's
she saying?

08:38.017 --> 08:42.605
Gather around, dudes,
Rocket Girl's got the plan.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.074
Ah, there you are,
little cuzzes.

08:53.157 --> 08:57.286
Just in time for a big game
of Hawaiian charades.

08:59.956 --> 09:04.460
Okay, first word rhymes
with <i> humuhumunukunuku'apu'a'a.</i>

09:07.463 --> 09:11.550
{\an5}(<i> yawns loudly</i> )
Sounds great, Tito,
but I'm beat.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.137
{\an4}(<i> yawns loudly</i> )
Yeah, me, too.
I'm going to crash.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.641
{\an4}Well, okay,
if you're tired, go sleep.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.228
{\an1}Have happy island dreams,
little cuzzes!

09:22.311 --> 09:23.896
Otto: Oh, we will.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.481
You, too, Tito.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.483
(<i> snoring</i> )

09:27.567 --> 09:30.069
(<i> muttering</i> )
Never plant the red coconut tree

09:30.152 --> 09:32.113
next to the yellow
coconut tree.

09:32.196 --> 09:35.533
{\an5}(<i> muttering</i> )
Otherwise, you end up
orange coconut.

{\an3}Yeah! Whoa!

09:45.459 --> 09:47.128
Yeah!

09:50.464 --> 09:53.050
How psyched are we?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.593
Night skating rules!

10:01.434 --> 10:03.978
You mean <i> I</i> rule the night skate.

10:05.187 --> 10:07.982
Whoa! Whoa! Ugh!

10:08.065 --> 10:11.193
I guess I'm having a little
trouble adjusting to the light.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.060
Oh, no, the Tito phone!

10:44.143 --> 10:46.187
Well, aren't you
going to answer it?

10:46.270 --> 10:47.813
{\an1}I'm not going to answer it.
You answer it.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.608
That's okay, little cuzzes,
you don't have to.

10:50.691 --> 10:54.653
Tito, what did you --
I mean, how did you...

10:56.030 --> 10:57.656
We're so...
Oh...

10:57.740 --> 10:59.116
Busted.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.868
I don't understand,
little cuzzes.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.329
If you wanted to come out
to the night skate,

11:03.412 --> 11:05.164
why didn't you just tell me?

11:05.247 --> 11:07.750
{\an1}Because you haven't let us do
anything we wanted to do

11:07.833 --> 11:09.085
all weekend!

11:09.168 --> 11:11.045
{\an1}You've been treating us
like little kids

11:11.128 --> 11:12.171
with all these rules and --

11:12.254 --> 11:13.297
But we shouldn't
have snuck out.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.256
We messed up.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.634
We're sorry, Tito.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.095
Yeah...sorry, Tito.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.680
It's like the old
Hawaiian saying --

11:21.764 --> 11:24.308
"Man who's always watching
for falling coconut

11:24.392 --> 11:25.142
ends up stubbing toe."

11:25.226 --> 11:27.770
Huh?

11:25.226 --> 11:27.770
{\an1}What?

11:27.853 --> 11:29.939
(<i> sighs</i> )
It means I tried too hard

11:30.022 --> 11:31.690
looking after my little cuzzes

11:31.774 --> 11:34.485
and became a King Kameha-
pain-in-the-butt.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.071
But that's all pineapples
over the falls now!

11:37.154 --> 11:38.322
We got night skating to do!

11:38.406 --> 11:41.617
Conga line! Whoever falls

11:41.700 --> 11:43.953
got to eat fried guava root
for breakfast!

11:44.036 --> 11:46.205
(<i> laughing</i> )

11:46.288 --> 11:47.915
(<i> laughing, cheering</i> )

11:47.998 --> 11:51.043
{\an1}Here we go!
Night skating goes on!

12:05.724 --> 12:08.602
This new board is sweet!

12:08.686 --> 12:10.646
Way to test-drive
it, bro!

12:10.729 --> 12:11.605
Tear it up!

12:11.689 --> 12:13.315
{\an1}Great job,
Otto.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.443
{\an8}Yeah, uh, great
job, Otto man,

12:15.526 --> 12:17.611
{\an8}except it was my turn,
like, an hour ago.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.989
Sorry you have to follow me.

12:20.072 --> 12:20.906
(<i> laughs</i> )

12:23.409 --> 12:25.536
Whoo-hoo!

12:25.619 --> 12:27.413
Looks like I set
the new standard.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.080
Right, Raymundo?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.499
Raymundo?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.671
(<i> gulps</i> )

12:35.754 --> 12:38.299
Um, can I...help you?

12:38.382 --> 12:40.092
I don't know. Can you?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.260
I'm Bree Copely.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.179
People usually
call me Breezy.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.514
Or Ms. Copely, if
they're really uptight.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.892
Then it's definitely Breezy
with me.

12:47.975 --> 12:51.687
Um, I'm Ray Uptight --
uh, uh, Rocket.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.190
But people usually
call him Raymundo.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.858
Raymundo?

12:55.941 --> 12:58.486
Now, that is a very cool name.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.112
Ah, thanks.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.325
{\an1}Um, these
are my kids --

13:04.408 --> 13:07.661
{\an1}Edgie and, uh, Rotto --
Reggie and Otto.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.331
And their friends...

13:10.414 --> 13:13.209
{\an1}I don't remember
their names right now.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.043
Nice to meet you all.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.378
I'm the new rep
for Sunset Surf.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.005
I'll be in town
for a few days

13:18.088 --> 13:19.840
to get you set up with
a new line of clothes.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.219
Oh, man, your stuff
is all-time!

13:23.302 --> 13:24.887
This is going
to be sweet.

13:24.970 --> 13:28.098
Oop, tah, hey, oop, uh, um...

13:28.182 --> 13:30.476
Sweet, sure.
There we are.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.769
(<i> chuckles nervously</i> )

13:31.852 --> 13:33.187
You didn't even
watch me, did you?

13:33.270 --> 13:35.314
Sure I did.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.399
{\an1}Y-you were doing
a skateboard thing.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.735
She only nailed a
perfect big-air ollie

13:39.818 --> 13:41.445
with a 180 flip
going into a kick flip.

13:41.529 --> 13:45.574
That's, uh, nice, Reg.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.660
Well, I've got some
other stores to hit,

13:47.743 --> 13:48.953
so I'll talk to you soon.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.621
{\an1}Bye, guys,
see you later.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.419
Ray: You know, I think
surfing skills

13:57.503 --> 13:59.380
are the same as
blading skills.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.758
You just have to adjust
your center of gravity!

14:02.841 --> 14:03.342
Looks like you
found yours.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.678
(<i> chuckles</i> )

14:05.761 --> 14:08.764
{\an1}Now, you <i> are</i> going to watch
me this time, right?

14:08.847 --> 14:09.765
{\an3}Promise.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.935
Boy, you have my word.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.603
Wow, hi.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.063
Wow, standing up.

14:16.146 --> 14:16.939
That is impressive.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.691
{\an1}You should have
seen him earlier.

14:18.774 --> 14:22.695
I, uh, just had
a little spill.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.822
Twice in one day --
what a nice surprise.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.409
Well, I've never been
to Ocean Shores.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.827
I thought I'd check out
the surroundings

14:29.910 --> 14:31.787
and see where
the natives hang.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.540
{\an1}We natives were just
getting ready to go blading.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.792
Oh, you mind
if I join you?

14:36.875 --> 14:37.334
Well, we kind of were...

14:37.418 --> 14:39.378
Sure thing!

14:39.461 --> 14:41.297
So, what do you say
we hit the bowl?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.881
{\an1}You know,
the bowl is really

14:42.965 --> 14:43.966
{\an1}for advanced bladers
like myself.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.052
{\an1}You might want to try
something easier first.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.144
How hard could it be?

14:55.227 --> 14:56.145
Check it out.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.147
She still wants
to hit the bowl.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.815
I got to watch this.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.900
{\an5}Twister:
Dudes, get ready
for a face-plant.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.995
Otto:
She rips better than you, Reg.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.246
Hardly.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.125
{\an1}Come on, guys,
join in.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.424
You got to teach me
that move, Breezy.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.009
That was tight!

15:27.092 --> 15:30.179
(<i> angrily</i> )
Don't worry about me.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.221
I'll catch up.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.187
Whoa! Whoa!

15:38.270 --> 15:40.230
Now you're leaning too forward.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.150
{\an5}Reggie:
Plant your feet
further apart.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.860
They don't go any further!

15:44.943 --> 15:46.737
Better. That's it!

15:47.863 --> 15:50.199
Hey, check Breezy out!

15:57.456 --> 15:59.416
Whoa!

15:59.500 --> 16:01.168
Unbelievable!

16:01.251 --> 16:03.712
You surf, too?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.506
{\an1}I like doing a little bit
of everything.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.049
{\an1}You working on
a move there, Sam?

16:07.132 --> 16:10.469
{\an1}Yeah, I call it
"keeping my balance."

16:10.552 --> 16:13.806
Actually,<i> I</i> was showing him
a switch stance.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.059
{\an5}All you have to do
is adjust your arms,
like so.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.310
Oh, like this?

16:18.394 --> 16:20.229
Cool, now I get it.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.899
{\an5}That's exactly
what <i> I</i> showed you
in the first place.

16:23.982 --> 16:26.527
{\an4}But thanks
to Breezy,
he nailed it!

16:27.653 --> 16:28.612
Come on, Breezy.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.572
Watch me do it
in the water!

16:30.656 --> 16:33.367
(<i> boys laugh</i> )

16:33.450 --> 16:35.035
(<i> mimicking Sam</i> )
"Come on, Breezy.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.287
Watch me do it in the water!"

16:37.371 --> 16:39.707
Please!

16:42.960 --> 16:46.797
Hey, I'm here to help
stock the...shelves?

16:47.881 --> 16:49.007
You don't have to.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.926
Breezy stopped by
and helped out.

16:51.009 --> 16:53.137
{\an1}Breezy?

16:53.220 --> 16:55.681
{\an1}You let Breezy stock
the shelves?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.683
{\an1}I always stock
the shelves!

16:57.766 --> 16:58.892
It's no big deal.

16:58.976 --> 16:59.893
There's always
the next time.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.647
{\an1}All right, at least
this will give us

17:03.731 --> 17:05.273
{\an1}an extra hour
out in the waves

17:05.357 --> 17:07.151
for our weekly
stock and surf.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.944
{\an1}Um, actually the surf part
will have to wait, too.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.655
Uh, I'm taking Breezy
on a boat ride

17:11.739 --> 17:13.031
around the area.

17:13.115 --> 17:13.781
I'm going
to meet her now.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.285
See you later,
Rocket Girl.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.121
Oh...yeah, sure.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.665
{\an5}(<i> quietly</i> )
I was in the mood
to be by myself again.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.505
(<i> grunts</i> )

17:28.589 --> 17:29.590
(<i> grunts</i> )

17:29.673 --> 17:30.883
(<i> grunts</i> )

17:30.966 --> 17:33.844
You are really
on today, Reg.

17:33.927 --> 17:37.514
Because it's back to the four
of us, just the way I like it.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.225
(<i> grunts</i> )

17:43.896 --> 17:44.980
Huh?

17:45.063 --> 17:46.523
I couldn't help myself.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.983
{\an1}You guys made it look
like too much fun.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.486
Breezy,
you want to play?

17:50.569 --> 17:52.613
But we already
have four people.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.489
Who cares?

17:53.572 --> 17:54.823
{\an5}Come on,
this will
be great!

17:54.907 --> 17:57.701
Do you even know
the game?

17:57.785 --> 18:00.078
{\an1}Actually, I played ice hockey
when I was younger,

18:00.162 --> 18:02.998
{\an1}but I think
I'll figure it out.

18:03.081 --> 18:07.377
(<i> determinedly</i> )
Well, then...game on.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.510
(<i> panting</i> )

18:16.512 --> 18:17.930
(<i> grunts</i> )
Yeah!

18:22.267 --> 18:24.019
(<i> grunts</i> )

18:22.267 --> 18:24.019
Huh?

18:24.102 --> 18:25.938
{\an1}Score!

18:26.021 --> 18:28.106
Dude, that was
the sweetest move.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.359
{\an1}Yeah, that was
totally awesome!

18:30.442 --> 18:31.777
What do you
call it?

18:31.860 --> 18:33.570
How about
"five's a crowd"?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.031
Oh, and here's
another move for you.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.866
I call it "me leaving"!

18:37.950 --> 18:38.325
(<i> groans angrily</i> )

18:42.371 --> 18:43.747
I kind of get the feeling

18:43.831 --> 18:45.833
{\an1}Reggie's not too crazy
about me.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.709
No way. She just
doesn't like to lose.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.670
Come on, let's play.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.089
All right, boys.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.424
I think I've got time
for another goal.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.260
Whoa! Yeah!

18:56.343 --> 18:57.344
Yeah! Hey, over here!

19:03.308 --> 19:05.727
Why the sad face, little cuz?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.020
{\an1}You want to help me
carve pineapples?

19:07.104 --> 19:09.857
Why don't you have
Breezy do it?

19:09.940 --> 19:11.441
She probably knows how.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.609
Breezy's here?

19:12.693 --> 19:16.154
{\an4}No, she's playing
street hockey
with the boys.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.489
You know what?

19:17.573 --> 19:18.949
All that work in the kitchen,
I think I'm, uh...

19:19.032 --> 19:21.243
I'm going to take
a little break,

19:21.326 --> 19:22.077
get some, you know,
fresh air.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.163
You mean breezy air, brother.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.834
See? Breezy this, Breezy that.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.587
Sam won surf lessons from her.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.922
Otto and Twist always
want to skate with her.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.925
Raymundo follows her around
all the time!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.886
Hello! Did I suddenly
become invisible?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.597
You know, this reminds me

19:41.680 --> 19:43.765
of what the ancient Hawaiians
used to say --

19:43.849 --> 19:46.351
"A crashing wave
may thrill the breath

19:46.435 --> 19:47.978
but can't replace
the ocean depth."

19:48.061 --> 19:51.231
I'm not sure what that means.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.900
No one's going
to take your place.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.943
I don't know about that.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.280
Maybe this will cheer you up.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.116
I call this one the Kona Lisa.

20:01.199 --> 20:01.950
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

20:02.034 --> 20:03.827
Am I funny or what?

20:03.911 --> 20:05.621
(<i> laughs</i> )

20:05.704 --> 20:06.622
"Hello, Tito."

20:06.705 --> 20:07.414
"Hello, Kona."

20:07.497 --> 20:09.249
"Hey, how you doing today?"

20:09.333 --> 20:10.375
"Eh, not so good."

20:10.459 --> 20:11.293
"How come?"

20:11.376 --> 20:13.295
"Aw, surf was
down today."

20:13.378 --> 20:15.130
(<i> laughs heartily</i> )

20:18.717 --> 20:23.639
Just what I need --
a Breezy-free zone.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.850
(<i> sighs</i> )

20:26.934 --> 20:27.976
Beezy:
Hey.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.854
How did you know
about this place?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.940
{\an1}I read about it
in your 'zine

20:33.023 --> 20:35.067
{\an1}right here
on page seven --

20:35.150 --> 20:37.945
"Ocean Shore sweet spots."

20:38.028 --> 20:39.655
Oh, right.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.073
{\an1}You know,
this is incredible.

20:41.156 --> 20:44.451
{\an4}It really captures
the pulse of what's
going on around here.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.161
Really? You like it?

20:46.244 --> 20:48.038
{\an4}Sure. I wanted
to talk to you
about it yesterday,

20:48.121 --> 20:50.832
but you kind of
left in a hurry.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.167
Oh, yeah.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.670
I guess sometimes I get
a little competitive.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.004
{\an1}Me, too.

20:56.088 --> 21:00.217
{\an4}I've always wished
that I could express
myself with words.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.259
It's never too late
to start.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.680
{\an1}Well, I don't leave
until tomorrow.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.431
{\an1}Maybe we could hang out,
just the two of us,

21:06.515 --> 21:08.433
{\an1}and you could give me
some pointers.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.768
I would really
like that.

21:09.851 --> 21:10.978
{\an1}Otto:
Incoming!

21:11.061 --> 21:11.311
Whoa!

21:13.271 --> 21:14.523
Are you okay?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.650
{\an4}I didn't mean
to throw it
that hard.

21:16.733 --> 21:17.401
It's okay,
Twist.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.820
We're cool,
right, Breezy?

21:19.903 --> 21:20.278
Right.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.450
Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

21:25.534 --> 21:29.955
{\an4}You mean a little game
of "finders keepers,
losers boys"?

21:30.038 --> 21:31.748
Exactly!

21:31.832 --> 21:33.166
Beezy: We got 'em!
We got 'em!

21:33.250 --> 21:34.501
Over here,
Reggie!

21:34.584 --> 21:35.544
(<i> groans</i> )

21:35.627 --> 21:36.712
{\an1}Over here!
Over here!

21:36.795 --> 21:37.879
{\an1}Pass it,
come on! Yeah!

21:37.963 --> 21:39.548
All right, try to steal it away!

21:39.631 --> 21:43.093
Otto:
Over here! I got it! I got it!

21:44.469 --> 21:46.138
There. All done.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.724
{\an4}Well, I guess
it's good-bye
time, then.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.225
I have to visit some new
stores on the East Coast,

21:50.308 --> 21:53.103
{\an1}but I'll be back
in a couple of months.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.272
Cool. We'll hit Madtown.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.232
{\an5}And maybe we could
surf a little.

21:57.315 --> 21:58.692
A couple of months?

21:58.775 --> 21:59.860
That's, like, forever.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.820
It'll go by really fast.

22:01.903 --> 22:02.904
Oh, and I'm all set

22:02.988 --> 22:05.282
with my reporter
supplies.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.908
I can't wait
to get started.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.952
Reporter supplies?

22:09.036 --> 22:09.911
{\an1}Yeah, since Breezy
gets to travel

22:09.995 --> 22:12.247
to so many cool places,

22:12.330 --> 22:13.040
{\an1}I thought her
experiences would make

22:13.123 --> 22:15.542
a great column
for the 'zine.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.795
I was thinking we'd call
it "Breezy at Large."

22:18.879 --> 22:19.880
{\an1}Well, we'll work
on the title.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.632
(<i> both laugh</i> )

22:24.718 --> 22:26.595
Well, okay, then.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.680
Guess I'll be
hitting the road.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.559
{\an1}Raymundo, what is
that on your shirt?

22:32.642 --> 22:34.311
{\an3}Where?

22:34.394 --> 22:35.937
Oh!

22:36.772 --> 22:38.648
Busted!

22:38.732 --> 22:41.068
Ooh, Raymundo!

22:41.443 --> 22:43.111
Whoa!

22:43.195 --> 22:44.446
{\an1}Oh!

22:44.529 --> 22:45.614
(<i> guffaws</i> )

22:45.697 --> 22:47.115
Bye, guys.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.200
Look who's busted now!

22:48.283 --> 22:51.787
You're all, like, totally red!

22:51.870 --> 22:53.455
I'm <i> not</i> red!

22:53.538 --> 22:54.081
You are, too!

22:54.164 --> 22:56.875
{\an3}Unh-unh,
am not!

23:38.542 --> 23:40.418
{\an8}Sam: Do fries
come with that shake?
