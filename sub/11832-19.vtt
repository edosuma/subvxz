- Obviously, shockwaves
are running

00:04.110 --> 00:07.140
through the entire community,
as well as profound grief.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.100
Sister Caroline Oaks
was a beloved, beloved member

00:10.100 --> 00:11.200
of the church.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.010
Preliminary reports
say she was stabbed

00:14.010 --> 00:15.140
more than 30 times.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.180
- Oh, can you believe it?

00:16.180 --> 00:17.210
Just what I need.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.130
- Helen, it's a compliment.

00:19.130 --> 00:21.130
High-profile case,
you get the assignment, that's--

00:21.130 --> 00:22.220
- Too high-profile.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.040
I don't need that kind
of pressure.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.150
It makes my face break out.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.050
- Police were actually
responding to the calls

00:27.050 --> 00:29.150
of another kidnapping victim,
Cynthia Simonson,

00:29.150 --> 00:32.040
when they found
the nun's body in a closet.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.230
Unconfirmed reports indicate--

00:33.230 --> 00:35.110
- The arraignment's when?
- 9:00.

00:35.110 --> 00:36.230
- Maybe I'll stop by on my way
and watch.

00:36.230 --> 00:38.110
- Why?
- 'Cause it's high profile.

00:38.110 --> 00:39.210
And I want to be there
for your first pimple.

00:39.210 --> 00:41.190
- Ah, funny.
- This is big stuff, Helen.

00:41.190 --> 00:43.180
They must
consider you their go-to D.A.

00:43.180 --> 00:46.080
It's a compliment.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Murder in the first degree.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.080
We can set the trial

02:22.090 --> 02:25.020
Counsel, I have great respect
for the public defenders,

02:25.020 --> 02:26.180
as well as your work
in particular.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.130
But given the magnitude

02:28.130 --> 02:31.140
of scrutiny this case
is likely to generate,

02:31.140 --> 02:32.170
together with the limits

02:32.170 --> 02:36.040
on your office's resources, I...

02:36.040 --> 02:40.160
Ms. Dole,
would you step up, please?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.170
Ms. Dole, did you hear me?

02:41.170 --> 02:43.110
Would you please come forward?

02:43.110 --> 02:44.160
- I hope you're not
thinking of--

02:44.160 --> 02:46.200
- You win.
Congratulations.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.220
- Your Honor--
- Get together with the D.A.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.190
Let's conference
as soon as possible.

02:50.190 --> 02:52.030

I regretfully have to decline.

02:52.030 --> 02:53.110
My schedule--

02:53.110 --> 02:54.200
- Counsel,
this wasn't a request.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.150
It's your case.
Next.

02:56.150 --> 03:00.010
- Case number 32655,
People versus Nathan.

03:03.190 --> 03:05.070
- Can she really
make me do this?

03:05.070 --> 03:07.010
She can't make me, can she?
Can she make me?

03:07.010 --> 03:08.160
- Where is she?
- Chambers.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.140
- Come on.
- Oh, come on.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.100
You love these cases!

03:13.100 --> 03:15.220
Granted, it doesn't involve
a chopped off head, but still--

03:15.220 --> 03:17.150
- We don't want this one.

03:17.150 --> 03:19.090
- Why?
- You know why.

03:19.090 --> 03:20.190
- Well, then, humor me.

03:20.190 --> 03:23.170
- The victim is a nun
stabbed 30 times.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.180
This kind of crime,
the stigma will run

03:25.180 --> 03:27.200
to the lawyers defending
the psycho who killed--

03:27.200 --> 03:30.050
- Again, I keep going back
to the client

03:30.050 --> 03:32.000
who cut off the girl's had.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.220
You defended him.
- He was innocent.

03:33.220 --> 03:35.090
- To the public, he wasn't.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.180
So you faced the same stigma
there, Bobby.

03:37.180 --> 03:41.040
- Which is why we don't need
to be the lawyers on this one.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.090
- Plus, the district
attorney is my roommate.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.040
That's grounds for
disqualification right there.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.160
- Not if the judge
is convinced

03:46.160 --> 03:48.150
you'll rise above
the potential conflict,

03:48.150 --> 03:50.060
which I am.

03:50.060 --> 03:52.060
- Helen Gamble is also
an ex-girlfriend of mine.

03:52.060 --> 03:54.140
- You've tried cases
against her before.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.170
- Your Honor...

03:55.170 --> 03:58.030
- Bobby,
if I were to recuse you

03:58.030 --> 03:59.220
every time you've slept
with the other side--

03:59.220 --> 04:01.110
- Hey!

04:01.110 --> 04:04.000
- There's already
a lynch mob mentality out there.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.170
You can see that.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.110
I need to ensure
he gets a legitimate

04:07.110 --> 04:09.020
and zealous defense.

04:09.020 --> 04:11.190
You people fight for murderers
better than anybody.

04:11.190 --> 04:13.200
- You can't force us
to take this case.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.079
- Of course I can.
It's exactly what I'm doing.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.160
Go defend him.

04:22.050 --> 04:24.100
- I got them down
to straight probation.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.210
I think we should jump.

04:25.210 --> 04:28.120
- But Jimmy,
if I take any guilty finding,

04:28.120 --> 04:30.050
I lose my job.

04:30.050 --> 04:31.140
I've got a morals clause

04:31.140 --> 04:33.120
which says,
"any criminal conviction."

04:33.120 --> 04:35.080
- Maybe we could talk
to your boss.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.090
- He can't waive it.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.210
There's a precedent.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.170
This is a company
with 32,000 employees.

04:40.170 --> 04:42.230
This isn't fair.
This isn't fair.

04:42.230 --> 04:45.100
- Mr. Burrows, it's not like
you didn't commit the crime.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.170
You offered the woman money.

04:46.170 --> 04:48.110
- But I never would have.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.230
I am sitting in a bar.
I'm minding my own business.

04:50.230 --> 04:54.070
And she came up to me.

04:54.070 --> 04:55.190
- We're gonna
go with entrapment.

04:55.190 --> 04:57.210
- Is there any chance
we could win?

04:57.210 --> 04:59.210
- Yes.

04:59.210 --> 05:02.020
- But not a good one.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.100
- Well, the way
I see it,

05:03.100 --> 05:04.100
I've got nothing to lose.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.230
- Yes, there is.

05:05.230 --> 05:08.040
You get convicted
at trial, you could do time.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.110
- Ms. Washington,
it isn't exactly like my life

05:13.110 --> 05:15.120
has a lot of dimension.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.160
I have a job,

05:17.160 --> 05:19.130
which I've put
in 16 years at.

05:19.130 --> 05:21.090
I've been
a complete company man,

05:21.090 --> 05:23.050
and they say I could stay on,

05:23.050 --> 05:26.210
but not if I have
a guilty finding.

05:26.210 --> 05:28.230
I want to roll the dice, Jimmy.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.020
- This is bad.
- Oh, could I tell you.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.080
- First of all,
if this thing goes to trial,

05:36.080 --> 05:37.160
we lose a fortune.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.030
The court ordered
fees are minimal.

05:39.030 --> 05:40.070
- I don't care about the money.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.110
- What's with the panic, then?

05:41.110 --> 05:42.110
We've done nasty cases before.

05:42.110 --> 05:43.230
- This was a nun, Eugene.

05:43.230 --> 05:45.200
Stabbed repeatedly.
- I understand.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.080
But we've defended
child killers.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.180
Are you upset
on religious grounds?

05:48.180 --> 05:50.020
- Have you been watching
the news?

05:50.020 --> 05:51.110
- Look, we could bring a motion

05:51.110 --> 05:52.230
before a different judge,
try to get out.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.090
- Arguing what?
- Hardship.

05:54.090 --> 05:55.140
That we're too overloaded
to take--

05:55.140 --> 05:59.140
- That won't fly.
Look.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.220
Look,
we've been assigned the case,

06:00.220 --> 06:02.090
so we do the job.

06:02.090 --> 06:04.070
Lindsay, meet the client.
- Oh, great.

06:04.070 --> 06:06.140
- Ellenor, I want you to draft
up a motion for a gag order.

06:06.140 --> 06:08.010
No doubt,
Helen will be trying this case

06:08.010 --> 06:09.230
in the media
every chance she gets.

06:09.230 --> 06:11.090
You and Lindsay
will try it if it gets that far,

06:11.090 --> 06:12.210
since we're better off
with women.

06:12.210 --> 06:14.090
- I'm moving out of criminal,
remember?

06:14.090 --> 06:15.210
- Never mind. Eugene, I'd like
you to do

06:15.210 --> 06:18.030
a memorandum on changing venue.

06:18.030 --> 06:19.180
We should try to move this thing
out of Boston.

06:19.180 --> 06:22.110
- How about LA?
- Lucy, good.

06:22.110 --> 06:25.050
All calls from the media,
we have no comment.

06:25.050 --> 06:27.060
- Wait, you're putting her
in charge of no comment?

06:27.060 --> 06:28.140
- I heard that.

06:28.140 --> 06:31.000
- Oh, you heard that?
Such radar.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.150
- All right, all right,
let's get to work.

06:35.150 --> 06:38.130
- It isn't fair.
The guy is like this sad sack.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.000
It was entrapment.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.150
- What do you want from me,
Jimmy?

06:41.150 --> 06:43.180
- You know I would never
ask a favor in a million years

06:43.180 --> 06:45.230
that I thought was,
you know, unethical.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.200
- I don't know that, actually.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.020
But go ahead.

06:49.020 --> 06:51.000
- The guy is getting
a bum shake.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.090
He's worked hard in his job,
and he's about to lose it

06:53.090 --> 06:57.060
because some undercover cop
got him aroused.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.190
It's vintage entrapment.

06:58.190 --> 07:00.140
- So make the argument.

07:00.140 --> 07:02.080
- I'd like to make it to you.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.220
Judge Cohen's going on vacation.

07:04.220 --> 07:07.150
This thing will get transferred
to one of six divisions,

07:07.150 --> 07:09.080
including yours.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.150
I know Mark Patsos, the clerk.

07:11.150 --> 07:13.100
I'd like him
to steer it your way.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.210
- That wouldn't be a good idea.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.110
I wouldn't kick it.

07:16.110 --> 07:19.020
From where I stand,
your client committed the crime.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.100
And second,
I don't appreciate your even

07:21.100 --> 07:23.030
asking what you're asking.

07:23.030 --> 07:24.220
It amounts to an ex parte
communication.

07:24.220 --> 07:26.120
It's wrong, and you know it.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.090
- I've got a good guy here.
- I don't care.

07:29.090 --> 07:30.170
- Fine.

07:30.170 --> 07:32.230
Forget it, fine.
- You're angry now.

07:32.230 --> 07:34.070
Just forget it.
I've got to go.

07:34.070 --> 07:36.060
- Hey, Jimmy, look,

07:36.060 --> 07:38.150
I understand you want
to help your friend.

07:38.150 --> 07:40.040
But you have to understand that

07:40.040 --> 07:43.200
once I put on that robe,

07:43.200 --> 07:46.180
I don't play favorites
for anybody.

07:50.210 --> 07:52.170
- Yeah.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.200
Yeah.

07:55.190 --> 07:58.000
I thought I'd just take a shot.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.190
- Oh, I do like that.

07:59.190 --> 08:04.030
You do take your shots.

08:04.030 --> 08:08.180
Say, why don't you come back
in a couple of hours, huh?

08:08.180 --> 08:10.020
When the robe is off.

08:24.010 --> 08:26.140
- Hello, I'm Lindsay Dole.
- I know.

08:26.140 --> 08:28.100
I was there
at the arraignment, remember?

08:28.100 --> 08:29.190
- Yes.

08:29.190 --> 08:33.120
Okay, first off,
attorney-client privilege.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.130
Anything you say obviously
goes no further, so...

08:35.130 --> 08:37.140
- Yes, but you don't want me
to be too truthful

08:37.140 --> 08:39.159
in case I want to testify.

08:39.159 --> 08:42.059
We have to preserve you
from lawyer ethic problems.

08:44.030 --> 08:47.120
- All right.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.090
Any thoughts on how a sliced
up nun got in your apartment?

08:51.090 --> 08:53.010
- I haven't a clue.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.160
How's that?

08:56.160 --> 09:00.120
- This woman, Cynthia Simonson,
who called the police,

09:00.120 --> 09:02.060
was she being held captive?

09:02.060 --> 09:05.070
- Shouldn't you get to know
a little bit about me first?

09:05.070 --> 09:08.140
I mean, I'm sure a nice person
such as yourself has conflicts

09:08.140 --> 09:11.180
defending something
so vile as me.

09:11.180 --> 09:14.170
- I kind of stay
emotionally neutral in my cases.

09:14.170 --> 09:18.180
So let's just stick
with the facts of the case.

09:18.180 --> 09:23.040
Let's start with the underlying
kidnap charge on the girl.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.200
- I didn't kidnap her.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.040
She came back
to my apartment willingly.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.210
She just found
herself locked in.

09:29.210 --> 09:31.120
And that would be false
imprisonment, by the way.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.030
That's a distinction
from kidnapping.

09:34.030 --> 09:36.040
This isn't your first
case, is it?

09:36.040 --> 09:38.000
- No, it isn't.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.170
- 'Cause you've got a little
virgin thing going on.

09:40.170 --> 09:45.050
Not that I don't like it.

09:45.050 --> 09:48.090
- Look, Mr. Kingston,
you're in jail right now either

09:48.090 --> 09:50.000
because you killed somebody

09:50.000 --> 09:52.140
or somebody else played you
for the perfect dupe.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.100
Either way,
I consider you pretty stupid.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.070
And if you think you're going
to intimidate me somehow,

09:56.070 --> 09:58.100
we can just forget that because
I really don't have the time.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.110
I'm representing you
because a judge ordered me to,

10:00.110 --> 10:02.090
and I will defend you
as best I can.

10:02.090 --> 10:06.080
But don't mistake my efforts
for caring.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.220
You disgust me.

10:13.190 --> 10:15.210
- The reason
he even knew her is

10:15.210 --> 10:18.000
because she reached out
to help him.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.090
- How so?

10:19.090 --> 10:21.200
- He would show up
at the church sometimes,

10:21.200 --> 10:26.130
angry, despondent.

10:26.130 --> 10:29.200
One time,
Caroline approached him.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.130
That was the thing
about Caroline.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.130
She was there for everybody.

10:35.130 --> 10:38.210
- Being there
for him got her killed.

10:38.210 --> 10:40.170
- Three nights ago,
she went to see him?

10:40.170 --> 10:41.170
- Yes.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.120
She got a call from him,

10:43.120 --> 10:47.230
and he asked if she could come
visit him at his apartment.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.170
She knew nothing
about his criminal record.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.230
We told the police all this.

10:52.230 --> 10:55.210
- I understand,
but his lawyers are good,

10:55.210 --> 10:57.170
and they may take this to trial.

10:57.170 --> 11:01.070
I just don't want
to be surprised by anything.

11:01.070 --> 11:03.060
For example,
they might even claim

11:03.060 --> 11:04.200
that Michael Kingston

11:04.200 --> 11:07.210
and Sister Caroline were having
a physical relationship.

11:07.210 --> 11:11.010
- What?
- Their job is to get him off.

11:11.010 --> 11:13.010
They're not
beneath arguing anything.

11:13.010 --> 11:16.160
- Caroline wasn't having
any physical relationship.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.170
If that's gonna
be their legal strategy,

11:18.170 --> 11:19.210
good luck to them.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.110
They got the wrong nun.

11:21.110 --> 11:25.190
She went there to help a man
she thought was in need.

11:25.190 --> 11:29.020
- Ms. Gamble, you are going
to put this man in jail,

11:29.020 --> 11:31.100
aren't you?

11:31.100 --> 11:34.050
- Yes, I'm definitely
gonna do that.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.050
- This woman, Cynthia Simonson.

11:48.050 --> 11:50.090
You say you didn't kidnap her.

11:50.090 --> 11:52.180
- I met her at a bar
in Kenmore Square.

11:52.180 --> 11:54.100
She left with me.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.190
Happily.

11:55.190 --> 11:57.080
She was at the bar with friends.
Ask them.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.180
- And you came back
to your apartment.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.150
- To play Scrabble.

12:01.150 --> 12:03.050
- We're back to being cute now?

12:03.050 --> 12:06.170
- She left with me to spend the
night together,

12:06.170 --> 12:08.070
which we did.

12:08.070 --> 12:10.080
- Then why'd you keep
her locked up inside?

12:10.080 --> 12:11.150
- I didn't.

12:11.150 --> 12:13.110
I went out to get coffee
in the morning,

12:13.110 --> 12:15.140
and I have a barred door
with padlock.

12:15.140 --> 12:16.200
It's the only way it locks.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.050
- And the reason
you have a barred door?

12:19.050 --> 12:22.090
- Safety.
I don't want to get ripped off.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.190
Plus which, I had a nun
in my closet.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.130
I didn't want people popping in.

12:28.060 --> 12:30.090
[shouting]
- Come on.

12:30.090 --> 12:31.160
Back off!

12:31.160 --> 12:33.160
- You got your car here?
- I walked.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.200
Well, you won't be walking back.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.050
We'll get you to a cab.

12:36.050 --> 12:37.100
- You know where the back
entrance is?

12:37.100 --> 12:38.170
- Yeah.
- Yeah, use it next time.

12:38.170 --> 12:40.210
- Back off!

12:40.210 --> 12:42.190
- Why me?
Why always me?

12:42.190 --> 12:44.060
- Well, it won't be you
from here on in.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.200
I'll be with you every step.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.090
What about the supposed
kidnapping of the college girl?

12:48.090 --> 12:50.100
- He said she went back
to his place voluntarily.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.140
- What difference does it make?
He carved up a nun.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.020
- No, it may raise
fourth amendment issues.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.170
Do we have an address on her?

12:55.170 --> 12:57.160
- It's in my coat pocket,
probably soaked in yolk.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.120
- Ellenor, try to talk
to this girl.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.170
Eugene, I guess we should try
to make contact with Dr. Crane

13:01.170 --> 13:03.090
in case we want
to go with insanity.

13:03.090 --> 13:05.080
- Dr. Crane charges five grand.
This is court-appointed.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.020
And the state will never
authorize that sort of--

13:07.020 --> 13:09.030
- Just give him a call in case
we want to go that route.

13:09.030 --> 13:11.120
Given what he did, there's got
to be a chance he's insane.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.220
- So we're going to the mat
for this psycho?

13:14.220 --> 13:16.050
- Do we have a choice?

13:19.170 --> 13:21.160
- We had a few drinks, talked.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.000
- And at some point, officer,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.050
you told him
you were a prostitute.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.040
- I said I was a lady
of the evening, yes.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.020
- And how did Mr. Burrows
respond to that?

13:29.020 --> 13:31.110
- He was surprised at first,
maybe shocked.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.060
- What happened next?
- We kept talking.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.130
I eventually asked him
if he'd like

13:34.130 --> 13:36.030
to go upstairs
to his hotel room.

13:36.030 --> 13:37.090
He said yes.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.200
- Did you ever
quote him a price?

13:38.200 --> 13:41.110
- $400.
- And then?

13:41.110 --> 13:43.100
- We went upstairs,
he paid me the money,

13:43.100 --> 13:46.190
at which point I told him I was
an undercover police officer.

13:46.190 --> 13:48.210
I placed him under arrest,
read him his rights,

13:48.210 --> 13:50.090
and took him into custody.

13:55.110 --> 13:58.050
- Why were you working this bar
undercover?

13:58.050 --> 13:59.190
- Mainly because high-priced
call girls were.

13:59.190 --> 14:01.070
It was a problem.

14:01.070 --> 14:03.210
- And this was an upscale hotel
bar, right officer?

14:03.210 --> 14:04.210
- Yes.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.070
- A lot of out-of-town business

14:06.070 --> 14:08.010
people frequented it,
including many

14:08.010 --> 14:10.040
law-abiding people, right?
- Yes.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.230
- In fact, mostly law-abiding,
wouldn't you say?

14:11.230 --> 14:13.110
- Probably.

14:13.110 --> 14:15.000
- And you weren't out
to sting my client

14:15.000 --> 14:16.220
specifically, were you?
- No.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.200
- In fact, you didn't even know
who he was when you sat down.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.070
- No, I didn't.

14:20.070 --> 14:21.190
- And when you first sat down
next to him,

14:21.190 --> 14:23.180
you told him you were
an executive secretary;

14:23.180 --> 14:25.060
isn't that right?
- Yes.

14:25.060 --> 14:26.180
- How long were
the two of you

14:26.180 --> 14:28.200
talking before you said
you were a prostitute?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.000
- Maybe an hour or so.
- An hour or so?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.060
So for a while,
he could've thought,

14:33.060 --> 14:35.180
"Hey, this woman
thinks I'm attractive."

14:35.180 --> 14:37.010
That possible?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.050
- I guess.
- You guess?

14:39.050 --> 14:41.160
Well, in fact,
that was the idea, wasn't it?

14:41.160 --> 14:43.050
- I suppose it was.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.160
- So before you told him
that you worked for hire,

14:46.160 --> 14:49.190
do you think it was possible
he was already hoping

14:49.190 --> 14:51.050
maybe something

14:51.050 --> 14:53.190
could happen upstairs
in his hotel room?

14:53.190 --> 14:55.010
- I don't know
what he was thinking.

14:55.010 --> 14:56.140
- Did you feel,

14:56.140 --> 14:58.160
sitting there, he was physically
attracted to you?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.120
- Yes, I did.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.070
- Your Honor, I'd like to see
her as she was that night.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.200
- Objection.
There's no point--

15:04.200 --> 15:07.090
- It certainly goes
to our entrapment defense.

15:07.090 --> 15:08.200
- I agree.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.080
The court will be adjourned
for one hour.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.080
The witness
will return in the same attire

15:12.080 --> 15:15.170
she wore that evening.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.050
- Life with parole,

15:17.050 --> 15:18.230
we both save ourselves
a lot of aggravation.

15:18.230 --> 15:20.140
- Are you out of your mind?

15:20.140 --> 15:22.010
- He could have been out of his,
Helen, in which case--

15:22.010 --> 15:23.120
- There's no way
I'm making any deal

15:23.120 --> 15:25.090
which allows this guy
to see the street again.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.210
- I understand
the public outcry, but--

15:26.210 --> 15:28.220
- It has nothing
to do with public outcry.

15:37.210 --> 15:41.030
Look at what he did.

15:41.030 --> 15:44.100
That's how she was found.

15:44.100 --> 15:47.220
You want him free one day?

15:47.220 --> 15:50.000
- No.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.090
But if you don't
offer us something,

15:51.090 --> 15:55.000
we have no choice
but to go to trial.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.200
We'll agree to life.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.160
- I can't agree to parole,
come on.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.020
Did you really expect me to?

16:00.020 --> 16:01.190
- I don't feel
like devoting six months

16:01.190 --> 16:03.020
of my life to this guy.

16:03.020 --> 16:05.170
- Judge Hiller did that to you,
not me.

16:12.210 --> 16:14.200
- Could you stand facing
the front?

16:18.050 --> 16:19.100
Okay.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.010
Now facing me.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.180
Could you just walk
over to the foreman.

16:26.180 --> 16:28.160
Hold his hand.
- Objection.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.130
- A woman like this touches you,
it has an effect, Your Honor.

16:33.130 --> 16:35.070
- Go ahead.

16:43.190 --> 16:46.010
- Now smile at him
like you did my client.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.230
- Objection.

16:49.230 --> 16:51.170
Objection!

16:56.140 --> 16:58.070
- I really
appreciate you coming in.

16:58.070 --> 16:59.180
- Well,
you shouldn't thank me too fast.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.150
I have absolutely no intention
of helping him.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.080
- Believe me,
we completely understand.

17:03.080 --> 17:06.069
We just have a few questions.

17:06.069 --> 17:07.140
- The police say
that you were locked

17:07.140 --> 17:09.099
inside Mr. Kingston's home.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.140
- Yeah, it was like one
of those barricade doors.

17:11.140 --> 17:14.040
- And you went there willingly,
correct?

17:14.040 --> 17:15.069
- Yeah, I spent the night.

17:18.150 --> 17:22.030
- At what point did you decide
that you were kidnapped?

17:22.030 --> 17:24.020
- When I woke up.

17:24.020 --> 17:27.119
He was gone,
and I couldn't get out.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.180
The door was padlocked.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.140
I called the police.
I was panicked.

17:30.140 --> 17:32.040
- And when they got there,

17:32.040 --> 17:34.070
you told them that
there were guns in the closet?

17:34.070 --> 17:36.040
- I told them
that's what he told me.

17:43.110 --> 17:45.180
- And that's
when they opened it up?

17:45.180 --> 17:49.070
- Yeah, that's the last thing
I remember before passing out.

17:49.070 --> 17:51.000
When they opened
the door, and I...

17:54.070 --> 17:57.140
I spent the night with him.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.080
I could've been next.

18:04.160 --> 18:08.020
- Good news or bad,
depending on how you look at it.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.180
- What?

18:09.180 --> 18:12.140
- We got a shot
at getting this case kicked.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.210
- Excuse me?
- Fourth amendment.

18:14.210 --> 18:17.010
Could be a bogus search.
- How do you figure?

18:17.010 --> 18:18.190
They moved in on a kidnap.

18:18.190 --> 18:20.170
- There was no kidnap
here, Bobby.

18:20.170 --> 18:22.130
He was coming back
to the place with donuts.

18:22.130 --> 18:23.180
- The police didn't know that.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.110
- Bobby,
there was nothing exigent.

18:25.110 --> 18:26.220
- The arresting officer's taking
the stand tomorrow

18:26.220 --> 18:28.090
at the P.C. hearing.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.170
If he says
what I think he's going to,

18:29.170 --> 18:31.120
our little nun killer
could walk.

18:31.120 --> 18:34.120
- Lindsay, there was a woman
locked up inside his apartment

18:34.120 --> 18:36.100
and a chopped up nun.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.130
- And I'm telling you
we might be able

18:37.130 --> 18:39.190
to suppress the chopped up nun.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.050
- I don't really want to.

18:45.050 --> 18:46.230
- You think I do?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.020
- You've been kind of quiet.
- Me?

19:00.020 --> 19:03.160
Well, you try taking the side
of evil.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.010
- Yeah, well,
I'd say let's head in together,

19:06.010 --> 19:08.110
but my hair doesn't like
egg shampoo, so...

19:08.110 --> 19:09.210
- Well, you know, we're supposed
to be on different sides.

19:09.210 --> 19:11.010
It wouldn't look so good
if we marched

19:11.010 --> 19:12.230
in together, would it?
- No.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.160
See you there?
- See you there.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.160
- She has no idea
she's about to be ambushed.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.010
I feel like a snake.

19:25.010 --> 19:26.070
- Lindsay,
it would have been unethical

19:26.070 --> 19:27.100
for you to give her the idea.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.180
[shouting]

19:30.180 --> 19:32.060
- Would you clear them out?

19:32.060 --> 19:34.160
- Open to the public.
- This is incitement!

19:34.160 --> 19:36.120
- Let's just keep moving,
please.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.040
- I paid the woman the money.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.180
I don't deny that.
- But?

19:42.180 --> 19:46.020
- But I didn't go into the bar
looking for a call girl.

19:46.020 --> 19:47.120
I sat down
at the bar,

19:47.120 --> 19:50.190
I ordered a nightcap,
then she sat down.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.080
- Okay, but Mr. Burrows,

19:52.080 --> 19:55.000
she didn't force
you to hire her services.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.040
- We were talking.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.020
Getting along.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.020
You know, I should have known
something was up.

20:00.020 --> 20:03.070
Pretty women
never come up to me.

20:03.070 --> 20:06.130
Things were getting flirtatious.

20:06.130 --> 20:10.050
And I started thinking,
hotel bar,

20:10.050 --> 20:12.180
I'm on the road,
she says she's on the road.

20:12.180 --> 20:14.110
And my mind is going right

20:14.110 --> 20:16.170
to where a man's mind
goes to in these situations.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.060
- Which is where?

20:18.060 --> 20:21.070
- My penis.
- Mr. Burrows!

20:21.070 --> 20:23.160
- I'm just being honest.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.060
I haven't slept with a woman
in four years.

20:26.060 --> 20:28.000
I don't even go looking for it.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.180
I'm a realist.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.190
But now, suddenly I'm thinking
this is a possibility.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.070
- And then?

20:34.070 --> 20:36.060
- Then she tells me she's a lady
of the evening.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.150
- And how did you respond?

20:38.150 --> 20:40.050
- I was crushed.

20:40.050 --> 20:41.200
One minute,
I was thinking

20:41.200 --> 20:45.080
this beautiful woman
was actually attracted to me,

20:45.080 --> 20:48.010
and then the next, I come
crashing back down to Earth.

20:48.010 --> 20:51.050
But as we continue talking,
I begin to realize

20:51.050 --> 20:54.040
why she's sitting there
and smiling at me.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.170
And it occurs to me
that this possibility

20:56.170 --> 20:59.050
that I'd been so excited about,

20:59.050 --> 21:01.040
that still exists.

21:01.040 --> 21:05.160
And all of these little dreams
I had been dreaming--

21:05.160 --> 21:08.060
Well, suddenly
$400 seemed cheap,

21:08.060 --> 21:10.160
and I said yes.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.030
She got me as thirsty
as she could,

21:13.030 --> 21:14.180
she led me
to a trough,

21:14.180 --> 21:18.070
and then I get arrested
because I wanted to drink.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.020
- We were responding to a 911.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.100
When we got there,
we found the girl

21:23.100 --> 21:25.030
behind the padlocked steel door.

21:25.030 --> 21:26.130
- Then what happened?

21:26.130 --> 21:28.080
- We cut through the door,
freed the woman.

21:28.080 --> 21:32.190
She told us the suspect had guns
or something in the closet.

21:32.190 --> 21:35.040
We opened the closet door

21:35.040 --> 21:38.170
and found the remains
of the nun.

21:38.170 --> 21:40.040
- After you cut
through the front door

21:40.040 --> 21:42.190
to reach Ms. Simonson,

21:42.190 --> 21:45.190
there was no real emergency,
was there, officer?

21:45.190 --> 21:47.090
- I suppose not.

21:47.090 --> 21:49.000
- And did you feel
Ms. Simonson had the authority

21:49.000 --> 21:51.120
to give you permission
to open the closet?

21:51.120 --> 21:52.230
- Well...

21:52.230 --> 21:54.180
- You knew it wasn't her home,
right?

21:57.210 --> 22:00.180
And by the way,
how did you open the closet?

22:00.180 --> 22:02.130
- Crowbar.

22:02.130 --> 22:04.080
- Your Honor,
at this time, the defense

22:04.080 --> 22:06.110
asks that you suppress
the entire contents

22:06.110 --> 22:08.050
of that closet.

22:13.200 --> 22:17.030
- Quiet down.

22:17.030 --> 22:19.050
I'll see Counsel in chambers.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.210
- It's a no-brainer.
No exigency, no plain sight.

22:27.210 --> 22:30.060
- The police were responding to
what they thought was a kidnap.

22:30.060 --> 22:32.030
- But after they went in,
they had the girl.

22:32.030 --> 22:33.180
- And if there's cause
for an arrest,

22:33.180 --> 22:35.050
there's cause for
a search incident to an arrest.

22:35.050 --> 22:37.000
- Did you just make that up?
- Hold on.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.220
- They could have secured
the premises, got the warrant.

22:38.220 --> 22:40.070
They could have come back
and searched.

22:40.070 --> 22:42.050
Instead, they just
skipped the warrant.

22:42.050 --> 22:44.090
- If there was one kidnap,
there could have been two.

22:44.090 --> 22:46.010
Somebody clearly could have been
in that closet.

22:46.010 --> 22:47.130
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, Helen, don't insult--

22:47.130 --> 22:50.050
- All right,
let's just cut through this.

22:50.050 --> 22:52.060
I'm told you'd agree to life
with parole.

22:52.060 --> 22:53.140
Let's just do that.

22:53.140 --> 22:55.080
- That offer isn't on the table
anymore.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.120
- Bobby, I suggest you take it.
- Why?

22:57.120 --> 23:00.130
- Because that officer
could have reasonably believed

23:00.130 --> 23:02.100
there were
exigent circumstances.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.170
- What?
- He's a young kid.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.010
He comes upon a kidnap.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.090
- Hold on a second.

23:06.090 --> 23:07.190
- Lower your voice, please.

23:07.190 --> 23:09.100
- You stuck us on this case
to do a job.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.060
- Which I'm grateful for.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.200
- And you got to do yours.
- Don't you raise your voice.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.190
- You're looking
to avoid setting this guy free.

23:15.190 --> 23:17.180
I get it.
But the search was bad.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.020
- I said lower your voice.

23:19.020 --> 23:20.160
- There were no exigent
circumstances.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.170
The suspect wasn't even there.

23:22.170 --> 23:24.080
They knew
the girl had no authority

23:24.080 --> 23:25.190
to say yes to the search.

23:25.190 --> 23:27.120
They had to get a warrant.
They didn't.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.020
They screwed up.

23:29.020 --> 23:30.210
And everybody in this room
knows they screwed up.

23:30.210 --> 23:33.070
- And if you suppress
the contents of that closet,

23:33.070 --> 23:34.190
this guy walks.

23:34.190 --> 23:36.050
We all know that too.

23:36.050 --> 23:40.220
The victim
and the weapon were inside.

23:40.220 --> 23:42.150
- I'll hear all arguments
tomorrow.

23:42.150 --> 23:44.050
- Why?
- Because I want to.

23:44.050 --> 23:45.150
It's my prerogative.

23:45.150 --> 23:47.010
Do you keep forgetting
I'm the judge?

23:47.010 --> 23:49.070
- Let's not you forget it.

23:49.070 --> 23:54.020
- Oral arguments
at 10:00 tomorrow.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.140
- I'll see Ms. Gamble alone.

23:55.140 --> 23:58.000
- Why?
- Hey, out!

24:05.040 --> 24:08.000
You better give me something,
Helen.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.220
I don't want
to set him free any more

24:09.220 --> 24:11.050
than you want me to,

24:11.050 --> 24:12.160
but you better
give me something,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.100
because...

24:19.030 --> 24:21.060
- Your Honor.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.100
- Go get something.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.070
You haven't got much time.

24:30.170 --> 24:32.220
- Under the belief
this woman was a prostitute,

24:32.220 --> 24:36.070
you agreed to pay her
$400 for sex.

24:36.070 --> 24:38.080
- She had me
in an aroused state.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.090
- Is that your defense?

24:39.090 --> 24:41.020
You were in an aroused state?

24:41.020 --> 24:44.030
- My defense is entrapment.

24:44.030 --> 24:46.010
And this crime
would never have happened

24:46.010 --> 24:47.100
if she hadn't come along.

24:47.100 --> 24:50.150
- You agreed to pay her
$400 for sex.

24:50.150 --> 24:52.140
- Yes, Mr. Tisbury.

24:52.140 --> 24:54.130
They got me.
Good for them.

24:54.130 --> 24:55.230
- Your Honor, I--
- No, no.

24:55.230 --> 24:57.130
Jimmy, don't tell me
to calm down.

24:57.130 --> 24:58.210
Now I'm angry.
Now, listen.

24:58.210 --> 25:01.070
I pay my taxes,
and this is what I get?

25:01.070 --> 25:04.100
The government is waving
illegal candy bars in my face

25:04.100 --> 25:06.020
hoping that I will bite!

25:06.020 --> 25:08.020
- And you did bite,
didn't you, sir?

25:08.020 --> 25:11.120
- Which brings me right back
to congratulations!

25:11.120 --> 25:13.160
Listen, you know, maybe
you ought to litter the streets

25:13.160 --> 25:16.010
with $20 bills
next and bust the homeless

25:16.010 --> 25:17.200
when they don't turn them in.

25:26.060 --> 25:28.080
- What the hell was that?
- I'm angry.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.080
- Our chances ride on sympathy,
and you just blew it.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.150
- I don't care.

25:31.150 --> 25:32.150
When I think
about what they did--

25:32.150 --> 25:34.010
- No, you did it.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.110
They maybe brought you
to the trough,

25:35.110 --> 25:36.180
but you did drink, Clyde.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.040
- I wanted to drink.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.230
I wanted to bite.
But I didn't.

25:39.230 --> 25:41.110
- 'Cause you got arrested
before you could!

25:41.110 --> 25:43.230
- All right, Clyde,
if we can still settle--

25:43.230 --> 25:46.090
- No!

25:46.090 --> 25:48.190
You know something,
Jimmy, I'm a weak person.

25:48.190 --> 25:50.050
I know that.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.090
But I never broke a damn law
in my life.

25:52.090 --> 25:54.100
- Well, you broke this one.
- They caused me to.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.180
And it just isn't fair.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.170
- Anything and everything on
search and seizure.

26:02.170 --> 26:04.030
Get on Westlaw.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.230
Check the Virginia case
that threw out Miranda.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.230
Forget lunch, forget dinner.
I need those citations by 7:00.

26:08.230 --> 26:10.080
Go, go, go.

26:12.220 --> 26:13.220
- Don't tell me.

26:13.220 --> 26:15.080
- The officers screwed up, Mark.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.010
Now I'm screwed going in there.

26:17.010 --> 26:18.120
- Helen, if he walks, this...

26:18.120 --> 26:19.200
- He's going to walk, Mark.

26:19.200 --> 26:24.030
Unless...

26:24.030 --> 26:26.140
Between now and 10:00
tomorrow morning,

26:26.140 --> 26:28.030
I have to find something.

26:44.040 --> 26:47.050
- How up to date
are you on the fourth amendment?

26:47.050 --> 26:49.080
- The fourth amendment?

26:49.080 --> 26:50.190
It's an embarrassment.

26:50.190 --> 26:54.080
What else you need to know?

26:54.080 --> 26:57.060
What's wrong?

26:57.060 --> 27:00.130
- I may have to set
the nun killer free.

27:00.130 --> 27:02.130
- What?
- Warrantless search.

27:02.130 --> 27:04.190
Stupid police mistake.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.060
- Oh, God.

27:06.060 --> 27:08.170
- Maybe I should just
look the other way.

27:08.170 --> 27:10.120
Let the appeals
court do the dirty work.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.150
- That isn't you, Zoey.

27:11.150 --> 27:12.210
We both know that.

27:12.210 --> 27:15.150
- Suppose I transfer it
over to you?

27:15.150 --> 27:18.180
- Well, it's not me either.

27:18.180 --> 27:21.220
Besides which,
I'm having a little thing

27:21.220 --> 27:23.150
with one of the lawyers
at Bobby Donnell's firm,

27:23.150 --> 27:26.000
so I would have
to recuse myself anyway.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.010
- What?
- Oh, Jimmy Berluti.

27:28.010 --> 27:29.160
A little frolic.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.190
- Have you lost your mind?
- What?

27:31.190 --> 27:33.130
I'm not supposed
to have a personal life?

27:33.130 --> 27:35.020
- Well you shouldn't be having
it with lawyers

27:35.020 --> 27:36.020
who appear before you.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.210
- I don't.

27:37.210 --> 27:40.110
That's why I just said
I'd have to recuse myself.

27:40.110 --> 27:41.200
You know,

27:41.200 --> 27:43.060
it's been quite a while

27:43.060 --> 27:45.010
since I've seen you smile.

27:45.010 --> 27:46.120
It wouldn't be such a bad thing

27:46.120 --> 27:48.070
if you went out
and got yourself a little--

27:48.070 --> 27:50.010
- Never mind.

27:57.140 --> 28:01.110
What am I going to do, Roberta?

28:01.110 --> 28:03.210
The man viciously killed a nun.

28:03.210 --> 28:05.070
I put him back
out there,

28:05.070 --> 28:07.150
he'll no doubt
kill somebody else.

28:07.150 --> 28:10.050
- What about the kidnap charge?
- It won't stick.

28:10.050 --> 28:12.130
They arrested the guy
coming back to the house

28:12.130 --> 28:14.000
with coffee.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.180
The phone
in the apartment worked.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.070
She was free to make a call.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.190
Clearly,
she wasn't being kidnapped.

28:19.190 --> 28:22.050
What the hell am I gonna do?

28:44.060 --> 28:45.190
- Nice bomb, Lindsay.

28:45.190 --> 28:48.100
Couldn't tell me
over breakfast, could you?

28:48.100 --> 28:50.040
- No.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.150
Sorry.

28:56.150 --> 28:58.200
- You know, I realize you didn't
want this case either,

28:58.200 --> 29:01.070
but still.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.140
What you do for a living,

29:02.140 --> 29:04.180
it's repulsive,
and your little credo of

29:04.180 --> 29:07.090
"just doing my job"--
it doesn't excuse it.

29:07.090 --> 29:09.120
- Hold on a second, Helen.
- No, no, you hold on.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.130
It says something
about a person's character,

29:11.130 --> 29:12.210
the kind of work
that she would do.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.070
- You're turning this personal?

29:14.070 --> 29:15.110
- The fact that you could
represent him,

29:15.110 --> 29:16.170
even under court order,

29:16.170 --> 29:18.070
and look at yourself
in the mirror--

29:18.070 --> 29:19.180
- I'm not gonna listen to this.
- Oh, no, don't!

29:19.180 --> 29:21.060
It might kick up a little bit
of a conscience!

29:21.060 --> 29:22.150
- Oh, give me a break.
- No, Lindsay.

29:22.150 --> 29:24.150
The breaks go to people
who kill nuns.

29:24.150 --> 29:26.080
- And the police, 'cause
they are always innocent.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.130
- The police try to catch
criminals, Lindsay!

29:27.130 --> 29:29.040
They don't--

29:29.040 --> 29:30.140
- Three of them planted a knife
in Ellenor's desk

29:30.140 --> 29:31.230
trying to frame her
and George Vogelman.

29:31.230 --> 29:34.040
- I'm not talking about that!
- I am!

29:34.040 --> 29:35.080
And, you know,
you're crying about--

29:35.080 --> 29:36.100
- This guy killed a nun!

29:36.100 --> 29:38.050
- If we could trust the police,

29:38.050 --> 29:40.000
then we wouldn't have all
these search and seizure rules.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.040
- Oh, don't talk to me!
- Oh, don't turn this on me!

29:42.040 --> 29:43.150
If you were in my position you
would do exactly the same thing.

29:43.150 --> 29:45.150
- I would never
be in your position!

29:45.150 --> 29:47.030
- Hey!
- Go to hell!

29:47.030 --> 29:50.210
- You go to hell.

29:50.210 --> 29:53.190
[sobbing]

30:24.230 --> 30:27.070
- Were you up all night?
- Couldn't sleep.

30:27.070 --> 30:29.090
I'm sure you could.

30:29.090 --> 30:31.130
- Oh, go to hell again.

30:31.130 --> 30:36.040
- Lindsay, I'm sorry.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.020
I don't mean
to take it out on you.

30:38.020 --> 30:40.150
But you're here.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.070
- You think I want
the guy free, Helen?

30:45.070 --> 30:47.010
- No.

30:52.030 --> 30:54.050
- He hired her.

30:54.050 --> 30:58.030
$400 he agreed to pay her.

30:58.030 --> 31:01.200
And his defense is what,
the aroused penis defense?

31:01.200 --> 31:04.130
The thing about prostitution,
ladies and gentlemen,

31:04.130 --> 31:07.110
we can throw the Janes in jail,

31:07.110 --> 31:10.010
but they end up
right back out there.

31:10.010 --> 31:12.200
Because they have no choice.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.140
Broke, some with drug problems,

31:15.140 --> 31:17.220
some with children to support.

31:17.220 --> 31:20.230
They can trade on their bodies,
and they do.

31:20.230 --> 31:23.000
They end up
right back out on the street,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.070
because, as far
as they see it,

31:25.070 --> 31:27.090
there's no other choice.

31:27.090 --> 31:31.180
For the Johns,
they do have a choice.

31:31.180 --> 31:35.230
Deterrence works on the Johns.

31:35.230 --> 31:40.030
And if we can shut down the
demand by going after them...

31:40.030 --> 31:43.150
And this man,
he had a choice, didn't he?

31:43.150 --> 31:47.050
He chose
to knowingly break the law,

31:47.050 --> 31:51.010
to pay for sex.

31:51.010 --> 31:55.150
Now, he has to pay
the consequence for that choice.

32:01.110 --> 32:02.170
- Entrapment.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.210
That's defined
as when a person

32:04.210 --> 32:07.150
is lured into the commission
of a crime

32:07.150 --> 32:11.040
that he has no predisposition
to commit.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.200
And that's this case.

32:12.200 --> 32:16.230
Clyde Burrows never
would have committed this crime

32:16.230 --> 32:20.030
if he had been left alone
by the police.

32:20.030 --> 32:22.120
That's entrapment.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.030
And Mr. Tisbury
stands here

32:24.030 --> 32:27.150
lecturing you on how
we have to stop the Johns.

32:27.150 --> 32:29.150
Clyde never was a John
in his life.

32:29.150 --> 32:32.010
He only became a John here

32:32.010 --> 32:35.120
because the police
convinced him to become one.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.080
In the big picture,

32:37.080 --> 32:40.120
is this what we want
the police to be doing?

32:40.120 --> 32:43.050
Staking out
law-abiding citizens?

32:43.050 --> 32:47.230
Baiting them into committing
crimes, then busting them?

32:47.230 --> 32:50.160
Sure, if Clyde Burrows
had been stronger,

32:50.160 --> 32:52.090
he could have resisted.

32:52.090 --> 32:56.040
Maybe if he'd been more moral,
he would have resisted.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.100
But he wasn't.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.010
He was weak.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.000
And thank God we have the police

33:01.000 --> 33:02.200
to go out
and find the weak

33:02.200 --> 33:05.210
and lure them
into committing crimes.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.110
Come on.

33:07.110 --> 33:10.140
The police are supposed
to protect us, not trap us.

33:10.140 --> 33:12.210
The police are supposed
to be catching the people

33:12.210 --> 33:14.210
who are out there
committing crimes,

33:14.210 --> 33:16.170
not finding innocent people

33:16.170 --> 33:20.120
and luring them
into committing crimes.

33:20.120 --> 33:24.030
Clyde Burrows
would not be sitting here today

33:24.030 --> 33:27.040
but for the actions
of a police officer.

33:30.050 --> 33:33.060
Is this the government we want?

33:36.120 --> 33:37.210
[phone rings]

33:37.210 --> 33:40.110
- Donnell, Young, Dole,
and Frutt.

33:40.110 --> 33:41.170
Oh, shut up.

33:45.220 --> 33:47.200
Heard of star 69, you idiot?

33:47.200 --> 33:49.190
I'm reporting you to the police.

33:49.190 --> 33:52.170
- What's going on?
- It's this case.

33:52.170 --> 33:54.060
People don't like us doing it.

33:59.230 --> 34:02.140
- Absent exigent circumstances,

34:02.140 --> 34:04.200
the police cannot search
without a warrant.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.120
- They thought
she was kidnapped.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.090
- Which buys them entry.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.020
But once they had her,

34:10.020 --> 34:13.040
once the exigency was over,
they had to get a warrant.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.159
There was no danger
of losing evidence.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.170
They could have secured
the premises.

34:16.170 --> 34:19.010
They can't even argue search
incident to the arrest,

34:19.010 --> 34:21.179
because the subject was arrested
outside the building.

34:26.090 --> 34:28.110
I know the idea
of setting a murder defendant

34:28.110 --> 34:31.199
free is, of course,

34:31.199 --> 34:36.139
repugnant to everybody
in this room.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.139
Especially this defendant.

34:38.139 --> 34:41.050
But we have a constitution,

34:41.050 --> 34:42.110
a fourth amendment and case law

34:42.110 --> 34:44.050
that couldn't be more clear.

34:44.050 --> 34:47.150
The police were required to have
a warrant to search that closet.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.150
They didn't get that warrant.

34:48.150 --> 34:50.080
As a result,

34:50.080 --> 34:54.020
everything in that closet
is inadmissible as evidence.

34:59.170 --> 35:01.060
- Ms. Gamble.

35:03.180 --> 35:05.120
Ms. Gamble?

35:14.120 --> 35:17.120
The fourth amendment
does not require warrants.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.100
It protects people
against unreasonable searches,

35:20.100 --> 35:21.160
but it has never,

35:21.160 --> 35:23.210
by its language,
required warrants.

35:23.210 --> 35:25.160
- The Supreme Court
has chimed in

35:25.160 --> 35:27.160
and said that it does.

35:27.160 --> 35:30.130
- The modern Supreme Court
interpreted it that way.

35:30.130 --> 35:33.000
The language
only requires reasonableness,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
and nowhere, nowhere does
the fourth amendment ever say

35:36.000 --> 35:38.030
that evidence obtained
absent a warrant

35:38.030 --> 35:41.060
or even absent reasonableness
be excluded.

35:41.060 --> 35:44.020
This exclusionary rule
wasn't carved out by the courts

35:44.020 --> 35:46.010
until 1961.

35:46.010 --> 35:48.190
That means for 172 years,

35:48.190 --> 35:50.130
the fourth amendment
did just fine

35:50.130 --> 35:52.040
without excluding evidence.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.120
The courts decided
to impose that sanction.

35:54.120 --> 35:57.080
The courts decided
that that would be the best way

35:57.080 --> 35:59.110
to remedy police misconduct.

35:59.110 --> 36:02.120
Now we've stretched it
to remedy police mistakes.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.000
Innocent mistakes,
which themselves are reasonable.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.120
If a convicted felon
locks up a woman,

36:08.120 --> 36:11.010
if he tells her he has guns
in his closet,

36:11.010 --> 36:14.080
reason says he's forfeited
his right to privacy.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.020
Reason says those police
officers should go in

36:17.020 --> 36:18.130
and investigate.

36:18.130 --> 36:21.090
- Are you asking me
to ignore the holdings

36:21.090 --> 36:22.200
of the Supreme Court?

36:22.200 --> 36:25.120
- I'm asking you
to recognize the absurdity

36:25.120 --> 36:27.080
of the exclusionary rule.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.020
I'm asking you to recognize

36:29.020 --> 36:32.210
how ridiculous it is to require
20-year-old police officers

36:32.210 --> 36:36.170
to understand the law
when judges and lawyers can't.

36:36.170 --> 36:39.030
In this case, there was
no misconduct by the officers.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.150
They rescued a woman
who appeared to be kidnapped.

36:41.150 --> 36:44.030
They attempted to make sure
the apartment was gun-free

36:44.030 --> 36:45.200
before the kidnapper returned.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.140
This is reasonable.

36:47.140 --> 36:51.080
That man sitting right over
there stabbed a nun 30 times

36:51.080 --> 36:52.190
and cut her into pieces.

36:52.190 --> 36:54.070
He has a felony record.

36:54.070 --> 36:56.010
He...

37:01.100 --> 37:04.100
Last night,
I got into a screaming argument

37:04.100 --> 37:06.030
with the defense counsel.

37:06.030 --> 37:11.020
She accused me
of making this personal.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.170
It is personal.

37:14.170 --> 37:17.200
I take my job
very personally, Your Honor.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.080
I like
to come in here

37:19.080 --> 37:23.090
thinking the work
I do counts for something.

37:23.090 --> 37:27.120
Just like those police officers.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.080
And when we see criminals
get turned loose

37:31.080 --> 37:32.180
on technicalities

37:32.180 --> 37:36.020
that have nothing
to do with merit or...

37:39.020 --> 37:43.030
The Constitution was designed
to protect the innocent.

37:43.030 --> 37:45.170
Not the guilty.

37:45.170 --> 37:50.100
In this case,
that man, Your Honor--

37:50.100 --> 37:54.070
Feed this right into the mouths
of the Supreme Court,

37:54.070 --> 37:56.140
if they want to spit him back
on the street.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.070
Yes.

37:58.070 --> 38:02.160
Yes, I'm asking you
to overrule recent decisions.

38:02.160 --> 38:06.080
We need a brave judge
to do that, Your Honor,

38:06.080 --> 38:08.020
otherwise they'll never
get the chance

38:08.020 --> 38:10.130
to revisit
the irrationality of--

38:15.070 --> 38:18.020
He killed a nun.

38:18.020 --> 38:22.070
He mutilated a nun
and stuffed her into a closet.

38:22.070 --> 38:24.230
The fourth amendment was never
meant to protect this animal.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.160
I'm sorry, it's personal.

38:41.170 --> 38:47.080
[shouting]

38:47.080 --> 38:48.220
- I don't want
to be Judge Hiller.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.090
- I think Helen did pretty well.

38:50.090 --> 38:52.070
- Given her hand.

38:52.070 --> 38:54.160
I've seen you better.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.220
- I'm sorry?

38:56.220 --> 38:58.170
- You hit all the marks.
You certainly weren't bad.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.010
But I've seen you better.

39:00.010 --> 39:01.010
- Are you accusing me
of something?

39:01.010 --> 39:02.120
- No.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.170
- Let's see you defend that guy
better, Bobby.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.020
- I wasn't criticizing--

39:05.020 --> 39:06.230
- Yes you are,
and I don't like it.

39:44.140 --> 39:46.090
- Will the defendant
please rise.

39:54.190 --> 39:56.210
Has the jury
reached its verdict?

39:56.210 --> 39:58.000
- We have, Your Honor.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.210
- What say you?

39:59.210 --> 40:02.110
- In the matter
of Commonwealth versus Burrows

40:02.110 --> 40:04.080
on the charge of solicitation,

40:04.080 --> 40:07.010
we find the defendant,
Clyde Burrows,

40:07.010 --> 40:08.130
not guilty.

40:08.130 --> 40:10.050
- Wow.
- Oh, God.

40:10.050 --> 40:12.080
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.040
- You stuck to your guns, Clyde.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.060
You hung in there.

40:17.140 --> 40:20.020
I got to admit,
I didn't think we'd win.

40:20.020 --> 40:22.000
- Well, I owe you big.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.100
- Do me a favor, from now on,

40:23.100 --> 40:25.060
go to bars
like this instead of hotels.

40:25.060 --> 40:27.160
Pretty women don't come in here.
Except for Beck.

40:27.160 --> 40:30.050
- I take offense at that.
- Roberta.

40:30.050 --> 40:32.090
- Hi, I just
swung by to tell you

40:32.090 --> 40:34.060
that I won't be able
to see you later tonight.

40:34.060 --> 40:35.180
I've got to check
on Judge Hiller.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.100
She may need me.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.060
- Well, how'd she rule?
- Oh, she hasn't yet.

40:39.060 --> 40:41.060
I don't know which way
she's gonna go.

40:41.060 --> 40:44.230
So can I please have a rain
check for dinner?

40:44.230 --> 40:46.020
- Sure, sure.
[pager beeping]

40:46.020 --> 40:48.060
- Oh, she's made up her mind.

40:48.060 --> 40:50.210
I've got to go.

40:50.210 --> 40:52.150
I'll call you later.

41:00.030 --> 41:01.140
- We're friends.

41:28.230 --> 41:31.000
- I agree with Ms. Gamble.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
There is nothing

41:33.000 --> 41:35.080
in the language
of the fourth amendment

41:35.080 --> 41:37.140
that requires warrants.

41:37.140 --> 41:39.080
Nor is there anything

41:39.080 --> 41:42.210
that says illegally obtained
evidence should be excluded.

41:42.210 --> 41:46.120
These rulings have been
carved out by the courts

41:46.120 --> 41:50.060
in response to our distrust
of the police.

41:50.060 --> 41:52.150
I also realize
the courts are more

41:52.150 --> 41:54.040
than willing
to adjust their thinking

41:54.040 --> 41:56.220
to the needs of the day.

41:56.220 --> 42:01.200
We search bags at airports
now without warrants.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.150
Make people
go through metal detectors.

42:04.150 --> 42:09.050
California requires fingerprints
just to get a driver's license.

42:09.050 --> 42:13.190
The Department of Transportation
has mandatory drug testing.

42:13.190 --> 42:16.140
We have
all these invasive things

42:16.140 --> 42:20.140
we do to people absent
not only warrants,

42:20.140 --> 42:23.190
but absent any suspicion
of wrongdoing.

42:23.190 --> 42:27.170
So why can't a police officer

42:27.170 --> 42:30.110
who has been told
there are weapons

42:30.110 --> 42:32.200
in the closet
of a convicted felon,

42:32.200 --> 42:35.040
a man suspected of kidnapping--

42:35.040 --> 42:39.060
why can't he open the closet?

42:40.220 --> 42:43.190
I agree with the district
attorney.

42:43.190 --> 42:47.040
The fourth amendment has been
interpreted

42:47.040 --> 42:50.000
and expanded by the courts
to the point

42:50.000 --> 42:52.090
where it belies
both the language

42:52.090 --> 42:55.090
and the intent
of the amendment,

42:55.090 --> 42:58.180
which is reasonableness.

43:04.060 --> 43:11.230
But I also know
the Supreme Court rulings

43:11.230 --> 43:18.050
on search and seizure
have set clear rules.

43:18.050 --> 43:21.100
And as much as I would love
to be a renegade,

43:21.100 --> 43:23.190
our criminal justice system

43:23.190 --> 43:26.160
has no chance whatsoever

43:26.160 --> 43:33.100
once the judges themselves begin
embracing judicial anarchy.

43:33.100 --> 43:36.160
The search
of the closet was illegal.

43:36.160 --> 43:39.010
The contents are inadmissible.

43:39.010 --> 43:41.130
With the contents suppressed,

43:41.130 --> 43:45.120
I find no probable cause
to hold the defendant.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.000
He is free to go.
