feeling of apprehension.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.692
- I think there might be
somebody in the house.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.161

01:44.171 --> 01:46.371

- Hey.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.052

strapped in,

02:00.087 --> 02:01.153
and we should be ready to go.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.721
- You go with Daddy;
get in that truck.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.022
- Yeah.

02:04.058 --> 02:06.125
<i>- My husband, Hunter,</i>
<i>was starting a new job,</i>

02:06.160 --> 02:07.893
<i>which meant we needed to move</i>

02:07.928 --> 02:10.195

to where he worked.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.396

02:13.701 --> 02:15.634
It was a lot more money.

02:15.669 --> 02:19.238
Had to make some sacrifices,
but we were very excited.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.707
<i>- It would be</i>
<i>just the four of us out there.</i>

02:21.742 --> 02:22.975
- Just gonna lift you in.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.977
<i>- Hunter, our daughter, Gracyn,</i>

02:25.012 --> 02:27.813

02:27.848 --> 02:30.249
This was a big change for me.

<i>I was gonna have to be</i>

<i>to use my journalism skills</i>

02:41.362 --> 02:44.997
to blog about
our whole experience.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.331
<i>- It's moving day.</i>

02:46.367 --> 02:49.434
<i>It's time for a fresh start</i>

It's a kind of, you know,
it--it fit.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.260
- Hunter is the love of my life.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.895
You don't often
get second chances,

03:16.931 --> 03:19.431

second chance, together.

<i>this country green landscape.</i>

03:27.775 --> 03:29.074
<i>I started getting nervous</i>

03:55.202 --> 03:57.169
It's so big!

03:57.204 --> 03:59.071
<i>- It was absolutely beautiful.</i>

03:59.106 --> 04:01.273
I was really impressed
that he had found us this house.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.041
- Are you sure we can afford
this, Hunter?

04:03.077 --> 04:04.776
<i>- I was amazed</i>
<i>it was in our price range.</i>

04:04.812 --> 04:06.278
- Oh, yeah.
It was a deal.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.247

[camera shutter clicks]

04:11.418 --> 04:13.485
[birds chirping]

04:13.520 --> 04:15.087
- That's gonna be your bedroom
up there.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.054
Big house.

04:18.158 --> 04:21.159
<i>- There were fields</i>
<i>as far as the eye could see.</i>

04:21.195 --> 04:22.728
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:22.763 --> 04:26.865
Our closest neighbor,
I have no idea where they are.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.800
- Come on, honey.

04:28.836 --> 04:29.901
I want to show you
the inside.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.370

Great.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.272
- Betty-Lou!
- [barks]

04:48.689 --> 04:51.356
- It looked like the people
that had lived there before

04:51.392 --> 04:54.326
got out in a hurry.

04:54.361 --> 04:57.529
<i>I didn't want Hunter to</i>
<i>be disappointed in my reaction,</i>

04:57.564 --> 04:59.698
because he was so excited
about this house.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.600
- It was a heck of a deal.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.934
- Yeah.
[laughs]

05:02.970 --> 05:04.936
I bet.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.105
- Pick out your new room.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.610
Let's put you down right there,
sweetie.

05:13.647 --> 05:18.550
- Upstairs, all I could see
was this awful, awful blue.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.753
- Oh, my gosh.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.158
- This paint had been thrown on.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.727
like someone
had taken a paintbrush

05:28.762 --> 05:31.396
and just done like this.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.231
Why would you paint
the window frames?

05:33.267 --> 05:35.467
<i>Why would you paint</i>
<i>the light switches?</i>

05:35.502 --> 05:37.703
- What an ugly mess.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.238
- Probably trying to liven it up
a bit.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.507
- What were they thinking?

05:42.543 --> 05:44.676
<i>[ominous music]</i>

05:44.712 --> 05:46.545
- It was creepy.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.817
[scurrying]

05:51.852 --> 05:54.319
- Gracyn, can you come here,
please?

05:54.355 --> 05:56.822
- It made me really wonder
what I was getting in to.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.658
[door creaks]

05:59.693 --> 06:02.594
- I think this is a bathroom.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.730
Careful, sweetie.

06:04.765 --> 06:08.433
<i>[ominous music]</i>

06:08.469 --> 06:10.936
- Why'd they take the mirror?

06:10.971 --> 06:14.439
- It was like the mirrors
had been ripped off the wall.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.208
<i>- You don't ever notice</i>
<i>a mirror,</i>

06:16.243 --> 06:18.477
<i>but when it's not there,</i>

06:18.512 --> 06:20.779
then you're like,
"Why is it not there?"

06:20.814 --> 06:22.948
- Anything else I should be
looking out for, Hunter?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.883
<i>- And then it dawned on me</i>

06:24.918 --> 06:28.353
I haven't seen one single mirror
in the whole house.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.688
- [whimpers]

06:29.723 --> 06:31.723
<i>- I thought, "This is just</i>
<i>another expense."</i>

06:31.759 --> 06:32.958
- Let's have a look
at the bedrooms.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.059
- Okay.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.179

on the ceiling.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.761
There was duct tape
on the attic entryway.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.464
- [whimpers]

07:12.499 --> 07:15.233
- It's been duct taped
completely shut,

07:15.269 --> 07:18.370
and it has that same
awful blue paint.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.274
- The tape has to go.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.709
So I reached up,

07:24.745 --> 07:25.710
and I yanked it down.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.814
[tape peeling]

07:28.849 --> 07:31.950
- [barks]

<i>- I thought the reason</i>
<i>it had been taped</i>

07:33.654 --> 07:35.120
<i>was because it was broken.</i>

07:39.059 --> 07:40.725
But it was fine.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.232

07:47.267 --> 07:48.700
<i>It looked like somebody</i>

07:48.735 --> 07:52.370
didn't want that attic

make this work.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.862

<i>It was like an intercom system,</i>

This house is haunted.

<i>- My first impression</i>

26:18.677 --> 26:20.811

26:46.038 --> 26:48.172
I decided to show her
photos of the house

26:48.207 --> 26:49.139

26:54.313 --> 26:57.581

- Jenny, I--

27:00.219 --> 27:02.786
I've seen it before.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.388
It's called haint blue.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.291
It's used in voodoo.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.625
<i>- It made me think back to</i>

<i>when I would visit New Orleans</i>
<i>with my mother</i>

27:15.067 --> 27:19.469

in your house.

27:19.505 --> 27:22.005
<i>- I felt I could trust Kim.</i>

I told her everything
that had happened in the house.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.991
You think this house is haunted?

27:41.026 --> 27:43.994
<i>- Jenny knew that</i>
<i>I was a historical researcher.</i>

27:44.029 --> 27:47.331
It's kind of like
being a investigator.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.899
<i>- I hoped we could</i>
<i>come together</i>

we can't stay here anymore.

It's too dangerous

Come here, girl.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.087
<i>- I'm looking for Betty-Lou,</i>

37:04.122 --> 37:08.091

maybe if she is hurt,

37:08.126 --> 37:12.261
<i>I can hear her yelping.</i>

37:12.297 --> 37:14.864
But I got nothing.

37:14.899 --> 37:18.401
- Suddenly something
just jumped off the page.

37:18.436 --> 37:22.939
The voodoo spirit
known as the Boo Hag.

37:22.974 --> 37:24.273
<i>It's just like a vampire</i>

37:24.309 --> 37:26.209

and sit on your chest
and steal your life energy.

37:30.315 --> 37:35.451
And after it's finished,
it will move into the attic.

37:35.487 --> 37:39.188
And I thought, "Well, the attic
was duct taped shut."

37:39.224 --> 37:40.790
[tape rips, door clicks]

37:42.660 --> 37:45.962
Had I let some sort of voodoo
creature out of my attic?

37:45.997 --> 37:47.630
- Betty-Lou?

37:47.665 --> 37:50.299
<i>- I couldn't find Betty-Lou</i>

37:50.335 --> 37:53.469
<i>Maybe she's on the trail</i>

37:53.505 --> 37:55.371
She'll be back in the morning.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.306
- Come on, girl.

37:57.342 --> 38:00.143
<i>- I began to think</i>
<i>was it the Boo Hag</i>

38:00.178 --> 38:02.512
that Buddy had seen
in the mirror?

38:02.547 --> 38:04.847
Had the Boo Hag
pushed me down the stairs?

38:04.883 --> 38:06.082
- [gasps]

38:06.117 --> 38:07.116
