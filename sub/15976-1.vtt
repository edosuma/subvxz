00:06.670 --> 00:08.585
- Okay, you'll be slated.
- We loved your tape.

00:08.620 --> 00:09.820
You want to look right
into the camera,

00:09.855 --> 00:11.340
bite that cookie.

00:11.375 --> 00:14.495
Smile. It is, like, the best cookie
you have ever had.

00:14.497 --> 00:16.458
Now, we're gonna ask you
to do this a few times,

00:16.493 --> 00:18.319
you're probably gonna get full,
so I'm gonna want you to spit

00:18.354 --> 00:19.603
in the bucket
when you're starting to get full.

00:19.605 --> 00:22.844
- Okay, so bite, smile, and spit.
- Spit.

00:25.077 --> 00:27.336
- Just bite the cookie.
- Let's start with the smile.

00:30.626 --> 00:32.058
Are you married to this look?

00:32.061 --> 00:33.494
Because...

00:33.496 --> 00:35.063
- Take a bite of cookie.
- Big bite.

00:35.065 --> 00:36.365
Mmm!

00:36.367 --> 00:38.133
You're gonna smile, okay?

00:38.135 --> 00:39.168
Oh, okay, and then...

00:39.170 --> 00:40.569
Wait, no, no, not the dress.

00:40.571 --> 00:41.937
So, bite, smile...

00:41.939 --> 00:43.105
- Then spit.
- Yeah.

00:43.107 --> 00:44.475
- Okay, so we can see your face.
- Bring it down.

00:44.477 --> 00:45.944
- That'd be great, and chew it.
- Bring it down a little bit.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.647
No, that's going up.

00:47.649 --> 00:48.948
- All right, now spit.
- And spit!

00:51.052 --> 00:53.193
There's a bucket right there.

01:10.668 --> 01:13.124
Sydney, hey, listen.
Hi.

01:13.126 --> 01:15.794
You know how I like
to be conjugal on occasion.

01:15.796 --> 01:17.541
Sometimes for the benefit
of the agency,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.131
other times it's less philanthropic.

01:19.170 --> 01:20.514
- Andrew knows.
- Don't involve me in this.

01:20.591 --> 01:22.710
Last night I did some conjugating
on behalf of the company.

01:22.745 --> 01:23.537
She was present, I was perfect.

01:23.539 --> 01:25.073
- It was all very progressive.
- Zach.

01:25.075 --> 01:26.910
She works in account management
at Chiat.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.946
Nice girl,
I think you'd quite like her.

01:28.981 --> 01:31.244
- Zach.
- They met with McDonald's yesterday.

01:31.279 --> 01:33.075
We're getting fired.

01:33.110 --> 01:34.859
That's what today's
meeting is about.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.296
What? My father's in
with them right now.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.697
Actually, he's not.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.632
I've been flashing them leg
for 20 minutes.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.903
I mean, that's assistant stuff, right?
Part of my job?

01:42.905 --> 01:44.974
- It is.
- We all had to do it.

01:44.976 --> 01:46.378
You ready to get serious?

01:46.380 --> 01:47.681
'Cause this is gonna
get serious now.

01:47.683 --> 01:49.151
I'm gonna eat
your little robot babies.

01:49.153 --> 01:51.387
Ooh! Your kung fu is no good.

01:52.923 --> 01:54.857
I could've been somebody.

01:54.859 --> 01:56.359
Come on, bring it, gumby.

01:56.361 --> 01:58.395
- Dad!
- What? Honey, look.

01:58.397 --> 01:59.997
I got him on the ropes.
Does he not look gassed?

01:59.999 --> 02:01.267
Come on, bring it!

02:01.269 --> 02:02.936
You didn't knock me down, Ray.

02:02.938 --> 02:04.240
Whoa!

02:04.242 --> 02:06.210
You got knocked out by a girl!

02:06.212 --> 02:07.545
Dad?

02:07.547 --> 02:09.047
There is a roomful
of McDonald's executives

02:09.049 --> 02:10.816
waiting for you,
and you're playing with toys.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.185
It's not a toy,
it's an emotional surrogate.

02:12.187 --> 02:13.888
And I'm not playing, I'm hiding.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.392
The creature is here.

02:15.394 --> 02:17.862
- Hannah Sharples is here?
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.864 --> 02:20.345
She's out during daylight,
that can mean only one thing.

02:20.380 --> 02:21.634
We're going to get fired.

02:21.636 --> 02:22.869
No, we are not getting fired,
okay?

02:22.871 --> 02:23.938
Look at me.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.775
I love doing that.
Isn't she beautiful?

02:25.777 --> 02:27.113
You have your mother's eyes.

02:27.115 --> 02:28.783
And her adorable
captivating seriousness.

02:28.785 --> 02:30.551
Do that thing that
reminds me of her, please.

02:30.553 --> 02:31.685
Just once, it's so cute.

02:31.687 --> 02:33.219
It'll send me into
the conference room

02:33.221 --> 02:34.286
with a little spring in my step.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.387
I'm leaving you.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.722
That's it, that's her.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.557
I feel like I'm back in court...
Take half.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.262
Hey, you know
the authenticity pitch.

02:40.264 --> 02:41.397
Indeed. It sucks.

02:41.399 --> 02:42.364
I want you to just go in there...

02:42.366 --> 02:43.899
What? It does not suck!

02:43.901 --> 02:45.933
Yes, it does. Little voice
in my head told me it does.

02:45.935 --> 02:47.632
And then this other
voice took issue.

02:47.634 --> 02:50.334
Then they all weighed in.
Now the vote stands at 23 to two.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.802
It sucks.

02:51.804 --> 02:52.704
Lauren, do not encourage him.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.906
The pitch is fine, okay?

02:53.908 --> 02:55.373
It works.
I want you to walk in there...

02:55.375 --> 02:57.008
I could walk.
I'm a good walker.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.543
I can also amble,
I could saunter,

02:58.545 --> 03:00.758
I could sashay.

03:00.793 --> 03:01.944
I'm gonna go in there.

03:01.946 --> 03:04.213
I'm gonna get it started,
and you will not leave me hanging.

03:04.215 --> 03:05.115
- Never.
- Okay.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.052
What is your name?

03:07.054 --> 03:08.687
Wait, I know this one.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.956
Simon Roberts.

03:09.958 --> 03:12.324
<i>The</i> Simon Roberts.

03:13.525 --> 03:16.191
You say it like that,
I almost think I could be.

03:17.493 --> 03:19.827
Why don't you take a minute?
Just a minute.

03:19.829 --> 03:21.930
Okay.

03:21.932 --> 03:24.025
Okay. Andrew, be ready
with the artwork.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.469
Zach, smile at anything
that moves.

03:25.504 --> 03:26.843
And maybe lose a layer.

03:26.878 --> 03:28.063
If it goes badly, two.

03:28.065 --> 03:29.860
- Lauren, you want to be a producer?
- Yeah.

03:29.895 --> 03:32.402
Produce my father in the conference room
in 60 seconds.

03:32.404 --> 03:34.407
And in the meantime,
if you can...

03:34.409 --> 03:36.676
- Inspire him.
- Okay.

03:38.278 --> 03:41.214
Want to smell my hair?

03:42.384 --> 03:43.585
Excuse me?

03:43.587 --> 03:45.187
My grandmother told me
that smelling

03:45.189 --> 03:47.524
a young woman's shampoo
can be life-affirming.

03:47.526 --> 03:50.127
Yeah, awaken romance
and eternal... whatever.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.363
Want a whiff?

03:51.365 --> 03:53.567
For grandma.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.012
She's right.

04:00.205 --> 04:02.906
Our concept is real beef,
real potatoes.

04:02.908 --> 04:05.512
Excuse me,
why are <i>you</i> pitching this?

04:06.748 --> 04:09.518
Because I'm the creative director
of this agency.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.803
You people are now officially
wasting my time.

04:11.838 --> 04:12.854
Where is your father?

04:12.856 --> 04:13.722
Good morning, everybody.

04:13.724 --> 04:16.858
Welcome, clan McDonald's, ah.

04:16.861 --> 04:19.394
Ooh, it looks like
somebody had an unhappy meal.

04:19.396 --> 04:21.962
Sit down, Simon.
I have something difficult to say.

04:21.964 --> 04:23.296
Is it "rubber baby buggy bumpers"?

04:23.298 --> 04:24.730
'Cause I always struggle
with that one.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.866
Although I have no problem

04:25.868 --> 04:27.236
with "Sally sells seashells
by the seashore."

04:27.238 --> 04:29.308
Maybe it's because I identify
with Sally as a salesperson.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.112
You can't charm your way
out of this one.

04:31.114 --> 04:32.046
Really?

04:32.048 --> 04:34.850
- As charming as you used to be.
- Ooh... aw.

04:34.852 --> 04:36.853
"Used to be," past tense.

04:36.855 --> 04:38.590
We have a past
and now it's tense.

04:38.592 --> 04:39.892
Authenticity...

04:39.894 --> 04:42.063
- Real beef from real c...
- We're fired!

04:42.065 --> 04:45.032
Is that what you came to tell us?
That's the rumor.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.667
Zach sleeps around,
he hears things.

04:46.669 --> 04:48.470
He may have even slept
with somebody here in this room.

04:48.472 --> 04:50.205
Show of hands...
Who here has slept with Zach?

04:50.207 --> 04:52.709
You have a pitch for me, Simon?

04:52.711 --> 04:55.067
- I feel like I should.
- Uh, real cows...

04:55.102 --> 04:57.447
with milk from udders.

04:57.482 --> 04:59.085
My daughter.

05:00.354 --> 05:02.588
Sometimes when I look at her,
I still see my babycakes.

05:02.590 --> 05:04.256
- My piglet.
- Dad.

05:04.258 --> 05:05.891
Remember the first time
I took you to Mickey D's?

05:05.893 --> 05:08.694
You were five.
Buck teeth and pigtails.

05:08.696 --> 05:10.362
That was just on me...
Weird year.

05:10.364 --> 05:13.064
- Maybe we should take five minutes.
- Those were simpler times.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.298
I was flat broke.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.002
But I still had enough money
to buy her a happy meal.

05:18.305 --> 05:20.639
Made me look like a king to her.

05:20.641 --> 05:22.608
I miss those times.

05:23.878 --> 05:28.015
- I think we need a little break.
- Yeah.

05:28.017 --> 05:29.484
Yeah, we do.

05:35.039 --> 05:37.282
This is a McDonald's spot
from 1972.

05:37.317 --> 05:39.679
Zach, my man, help me out.

05:39.898 --> 05:42.431
♪ So much life to be lived ♪

05:42.433 --> 05:45.297
So much life to be lived.

05:45.299 --> 05:46.942
Are you kidding me?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.313
♪ So much to be tried ♪

05:48.467 --> 05:50.322
Oh, so much to be tried.

05:50.357 --> 05:51.881
♪ And when you share it ♪

05:51.956 --> 05:54.177
- And when you share it...
- Are you gonna stop this?

05:54.374 --> 05:55.673
...you get...

05:55.675 --> 05:59.779
♪ A special feeling inside ♪
...a special feeling inside.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.788
What if we take those lyrics
and upgrade the images?

06:03.855 --> 06:05.821
Combine that
with the right voice.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.823
You know? Someone wholesome,
someone incredible...

06:07.825 --> 06:09.458
- Someone getable?
- Someone famous.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.195
- Someone available.
- The refrain from that 1972 spot was

06:12.197 --> 06:14.461
"You Deserve a Break Today."

06:14.463 --> 06:15.863
And today
people really need a break.

06:15.865 --> 06:18.534
Food is one thing, Hannah.

06:18.536 --> 06:22.874
But a moment together
with family is everything.

06:22.876 --> 06:24.643
Human connection.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.210
Look at each other in the eye.

06:26.212 --> 06:29.910
Those special moments
that are so gone.

06:29.912 --> 06:31.579
So missed.

06:34.913 --> 06:37.479
I propose we redo that 1972 spot

06:37.481 --> 06:40.313
and take a chance
on making people feel.

06:40.315 --> 06:41.783
You know how I feel right now?

06:41.785 --> 06:44.421
Like a guy who's gonna sell
an ass-load of hamburgers

06:44.423 --> 06:46.762
and some reasonably-sized
soft drinks.

06:49.266 --> 06:50.465
Fine.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.154
- Get me that voice.
- Perfect.

06:53.236 --> 06:54.719
By tomorrow.

06:55.441 --> 06:57.342
Even better.

07:04.922 --> 07:06.322
Well, if she got on
a 6:00 out of Atlanta,

07:06.324 --> 07:08.059
then she would be here about...

07:08.061 --> 07:10.197
Okay, well, who is handling this?

07:10.199 --> 07:11.665
Because I was told
you were the handler.

07:11.667 --> 07:13.133
Shakira's people...
they're bilingual.

07:13.135 --> 07:16.771
So I'm being denied
in two different languages.

07:16.773 --> 07:18.971
We're screwed... Jennifer Lopez
wants to be paid in diamonds,

07:18.973 --> 07:21.272
Mariah's at an ashram,
Adele's British,

07:21.274 --> 07:23.035
and Pink threatened me.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.609
- How we doing, kids?
- How we doing?

07:24.611 --> 07:25.943
- Yeah.
- You over-promised.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.892
If you had just pitched them
the authenticity campaign...

07:27.927 --> 07:29.977
- They would've fired us.
- Who knows?

07:29.979 --> 07:31.245
- You could've sold them on it.
- I did sell them on it.

07:31.247 --> 07:33.515
By over-promising something
that we can't possibly deliver.

07:33.517 --> 07:34.515
I always deliver.

07:34.517 --> 07:35.915
Remember that baby hippo
at the zoo?

07:35.917 --> 07:37.082
Maybe that was a dream.

07:37.084 --> 07:38.349
Either way,
I was in my underwear.

07:38.351 --> 07:40.348
Dad, this is not something
that you do to a partner.

07:40.350 --> 07:41.916
My name is on the door now.

07:41.918 --> 07:43.385
Really? I thought
that was my name twice.

07:44.355 --> 07:45.121
Lauren?

07:45.123 --> 07:46.388
Honey...

07:46.390 --> 07:47.356
We didn't get fired, did we?

07:47.358 --> 07:48.757
We kept the account,
did we not?

07:48.759 --> 07:49.758
We kept it temporarily.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.959
- Temporarily.
- Conditionally...

07:50.961 --> 07:52.962
on the promise of delivering
this big, musical icon.

07:52.964 --> 07:54.097
And last time I checked,

07:54.099 --> 07:55.999
icons don't like
to sing about meat.

07:56.001 --> 07:56.900
That is so not true.

07:56.902 --> 07:59.069
- "Meat Me in St. Louis."
- That's, uh, Judy Garland.

07:59.071 --> 08:00.772
- "Until We Meat Again."
- Diana Ross.

08:00.774 --> 08:02.772
- "Meat the Flintstones."
- Wilma, ba-bam-bam!

08:02.774 --> 08:03.839
Can you be serious?

08:03.841 --> 08:06.610
Well, maybe for a second.
No, see?

08:06.612 --> 08:07.645
Sorry.

08:07.647 --> 08:10.101
Dad,
McDonald's is our biggest client.

08:10.136 --> 08:13.276
If we lose them...
what are we gonna do?

08:13.311 --> 08:16.377
Well, for starters,
I'm having drinks with Kelly Clarkson.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.751
You remember her,
don't you, honey?

08:17.786 --> 08:19.557
I mean, big voice, super famous,
America's sweetheart.

08:19.559 --> 08:21.727
She's in Chicago.
I'm off to see her.

08:21.729 --> 08:23.263
What are you going
to say to her?

08:23.265 --> 08:25.031
I don't know,
I just know what I'd tell myself.

08:25.033 --> 08:26.031
Which is what?

08:26.033 --> 08:28.266
Leap and the net shall appear.

08:28.268 --> 08:30.101
Although to be safe...

08:30.103 --> 08:32.837
I'm gonna need some meat.

08:32.839 --> 08:35.273
Zach...

08:35.275 --> 08:37.309
Yes!

08:38.413 --> 08:41.816
He leaps
and gets Kelly Clarkson.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.083
Yeah!

08:50.942 --> 08:52.256
- No.
- No, no, please.

08:52.258 --> 08:54.060
Not just...
Not just meat.

08:54.062 --> 08:55.596
- I mean, it's about family.
- Mm-hmm.

08:55.598 --> 08:57.500
- It's about people connecting.
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.502 --> 08:59.503
And fries.
They also make great shakes.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.570
Yeah, the problem is, boys,
I don't do jingles.

09:01.572 --> 09:03.339
Well, uh, you know,

09:03.341 --> 09:05.843
there's a lot of things
that I find...

09:05.845 --> 09:07.613
- distasteful...
- And yet he does them

09:07.615 --> 09:08.983
for the good of the team.

09:08.985 --> 09:11.422
Sometimes...
just because it's Saturday.

09:11.424 --> 09:13.594
- Mr. Roberts...
- Please, Simon.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.463
- And Zach, right?
- Zachary.

09:15.465 --> 09:18.099
You're looking
to remake your brand.

09:18.101 --> 09:19.034
Mm-hmm.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.503
I'm looking to remake mine.

09:23.245 --> 09:25.448
- See, the old Kelly...
- Oh, please, "classic" Kelly.

09:25.450 --> 09:26.716
Kelly "classic."

09:26.718 --> 09:29.185
Whatever,
I want to sing about sex.

09:29.187 --> 09:31.654
- Whoa.
- Whoa, perfect, uh...

09:31.656 --> 09:33.022
I want to change my image.

09:33.024 --> 09:34.958
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- So I'll do your commercial.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.893
- But I want to sing about sex.
- She wants to sing about sex.

09:37.895 --> 09:38.793
Whoa.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.161
- Okeydokey.
- Great.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.995
I... We love sex.
It's my favorite, and...

09:42.997 --> 09:46.363
We just need to come up
with a meat-related sex song.

09:46.365 --> 09:48.669
For a family restaurant, I mean,
how hard could that be really?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.272
I mean, uh,
it almost writes itself.

09:50.274 --> 09:52.611
I mean, you think of, like,
warm buns,

09:52.613 --> 09:54.580
a hamburger patty, you know,
"I pat my patty."

to "You Deserve a Break"?

would have worked

sex on top of sex.

Yeah, when you have
that much sex, you just got

12:58.839 --> 13:00.880

13:32.035 --> 13:33.800
this is crazy...

13:33.802 --> 13:35.602
- Mm-hmm.

13:35.604 --> 13:37.337

13:37.339 --> 13:38.572
Yeah, like something
completely unsexy.

13:38.574 --> 13:39.740
- Like, off the top of my head.
- Like what?

13:39.742 --> 13:41.974
- "You Deserve a Break Today"?
- Oh, no, that's too unsexy.

13:41.976 --> 13:43.408

with a melody.

13:43.410 --> 13:44.509
No, that's...

13:44.511 --> 13:46.740

- New Kelly?

13:46.742 --> 13:48.604

13:48.639 --> 13:49.871

13:49.873 --> 13:51.170
- Really? We don't.
- No idea.

13:51.172 --> 13:53.338
You want me to sing
"You Deserve a Break Today."

13:53.340 --> 13:56.238
You're trying to pivot me.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.138
Wait...
A pivot's an actual thing?

13:58.140 --> 14:00.138
- It's an actual thing.
- Oh.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.236
I hate being pivoted.
And I don't do jingles.

14:06.473 --> 14:08.339

of our business.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.188

it's gonna hurt.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.590
So close, you know?

14:22.592 --> 14:25.728
I just thought if I got her in
the building, got her going...

14:25.730 --> 14:27.432
By letting her sing
"It ain't the meat"?

14:27.434 --> 14:30.170
Which worked.
It was the pivot that failed.

14:30.172 --> 14:31.537
I leaped.

14:31.539 --> 14:33.805
There was just no net.

14:33.807 --> 14:36.376
Maybe it's time to stop leaping.

14:36.378 --> 14:37.946
Aw, come on.

14:37.948 --> 14:40.051
These awards
didn't win themselves.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.720
Hmm.

14:41.722 --> 14:44.289
How much you think
a Cleo goes for on eBay?

14:44.291 --> 14:45.824
Dad?

14:45.826 --> 14:48.094
It is over, little one.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.997
You must treat this
like a cleansing fire.

14:50.999 --> 14:52.365
You will rebuild from the ashes.

14:52.367 --> 14:55.635
And I, like a tribal elder,
shall climb onto the ice floe

14:55.637 --> 14:57.071
and drift to my death

14:57.073 --> 14:59.441
in the arctic night.
It is a good thing.

14:59.443 --> 15:02.511
It will be a circle of life.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.518
I was so hoping
this would work for us.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.455
Us?

15:12.457 --> 15:14.255
Sorry, baby.

15:14.257 --> 15:17.327
Girl just don't do jingles.

15:19.832 --> 15:21.935
I might have to sell my robot.

15:21.937 --> 15:24.638
What do you mean,
it's not a jingle?

15:24.640 --> 15:26.340
I mean, it's not. It's a song.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.475
"You Deserve a Break"?

15:27.477 --> 15:30.277
Yes! It's a wonderful song
about family.

15:30.279 --> 15:31.711
Oh, you mean like the one

15:31.713 --> 15:33.512
I'm trying to hang out with
right now?

15:33.514 --> 15:36.750
Again, sorry
about your party, Trish.

15:38.085 --> 15:40.451
- She's pulling up a chair.
- Sorry.

15:40.453 --> 15:41.752
Okay, see, I don't do jingles.

15:41.754 --> 15:43.453
I keep telling people this.
No one listens.

15:43.455 --> 15:45.321
Kelly, the reason that I went
into advertising,

15:45.323 --> 15:49.229
besides my father,
was the Apple commercial of 1987.

15:49.231 --> 15:50.956
Do you know who was featured
in that spot?

15:51.025 --> 15:52.085
No.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.635
Gandhi, John Lennon,
Martin Luther King Jr., Picasso.

15:55.637 --> 15:57.636
Did they get paid for that?

15:57.638 --> 15:59.438
That's beside the point.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.542
But the spot,
"The Crazy Ones"?

16:01.544 --> 16:04.646
When Apple made it, they didn't
even have a product to sell.

16:04.648 --> 16:08.583
They were promoting an idea,
and so are we.

16:08.585 --> 16:11.755
The idea of bringing
people together.

16:11.757 --> 16:13.292
Look at this.

16:13.294 --> 16:15.561
I'm asking you to sell this.

16:15.563 --> 16:18.365
Okay, so this "jingle,"
as you like to call it,

16:18.438 --> 16:21.010
if sung correctly,
it can move people.

16:21.045 --> 16:22.872
Make them feel this.

16:24.876 --> 16:26.677
Show me.

16:26.679 --> 16:27.610
Excuse me?

16:27.612 --> 16:30.681
Sing it for me. Make us feel.

16:30.683 --> 16:32.517
Here?
