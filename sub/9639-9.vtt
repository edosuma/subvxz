00:05.060 --> 00:06.689
- Oh, that was a great movie.
- Oh, yeah.

00:06.830 --> 00:08.760
- Hey, come on, guys. One more time.
- Okay.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:19.640 --> 00:22.540
Oh, now, that is
what l call entertainment.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.540
That had to be
one of the best movies ever made

00:24.680 --> 00:26.240
about hockey-playing aardvarks.

00:28.620 --> 00:29.980
lt's too bad Justin wasn't here.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.479
He would have loved
Russo Family Fun Night.

00:33.550 --> 00:36.020
You know, l never thought l'd admit this,

00:36.160 --> 00:39.180
but l'm actually jealous
of Justin right now.

00:40.490 --> 00:43.520
What? l thought
you loved Family Fun Night.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.560
l used to, but l'm 1 4 now.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.690
l think l'm getting a little too old
for talking-animal movies.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.400
Oh, l get it. lt's a confusing time.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.340
On one hand,
you're not a little girl anymore,

00:54.480 --> 00:58.710
and yet at the same time,
you're not yet a woman, so...

00:59.580 --> 01:00.710
Awkward.

01:00.850 --> 01:02.440
Theresa?

01:03.150 --> 01:06.520
l think what your father is trying to say
is that no matter how old you get, honey,

01:06.650 --> 01:08.680
you're never too old
to spend time with your family.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.980
Exactly. Just look at your mother.

01:13.090 --> 01:14.490
Did you just call Mom old?

01:14.630 --> 01:16.060
What? No.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.630
What just happened?

01:18.800 --> 01:20.790
Who wants to sing another song?

01:20.930 --> 01:22.560
l'm not getting involved.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.170
Jerry, may l have a word with you
in the kitchen?

01:26.310 --> 01:27.360
Yes.

01:30.940 --> 01:33.040
Hey, l'm home. Did you guys miss me?

01:33.180 --> 01:35.010
- Not really.
- What?

01:36.380 --> 01:38.750
l don't know if you guys heard,
but l was out all night

01:38.890 --> 01:40.950
with a bunch
of my new friends from school.

01:41.090 --> 01:44.150
l know.
You told us like ten times before you left.

01:45.260 --> 01:47.090
Yeah, they're from
an upper-level math class.

01:47.230 --> 01:50.250
Kind of an older crowd,
so we totally lost track of time.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.860
Sorry l'm late.

01:52.930 --> 01:53.990
You're not late.

01:54.130 --> 01:56.570
This is exactly when you said
you'd be home.

01:57.170 --> 01:58.760
ls it?

01:59.170 --> 02:02.510
Well, l didn't keep track of time,
because l don't have to.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.440
lt seems to me
like someone's a little jealous

02:04.580 --> 02:06.070
that l'm old enough for some freedom.

02:06.210 --> 02:09.180
Oh, please. l'm not jealous of you.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.180
You told Dad you were jealous.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.450
No, l didn't.

02:15.590 --> 02:17.390
But you told Mom and Dad
you were jealous of--

02:17.520 --> 02:19.420
Okay, thank you, Max.

02:19.930 --> 02:21.660
Look, l could care less
about this nerd herd

02:21.800 --> 02:23.320
you're running around with these days.

02:23.460 --> 02:26.130
Face it, Alex, you're mad
because l'm more mature than you.

02:26.270 --> 02:27.360
Mature?

02:27.500 --> 02:29.900
You're the only one in this family
who still takes a bath.

02:31.370 --> 02:33.500
You try floating an aircraft carrier
in the shower.

02:35.210 --> 02:37.110
For an experiment.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.860
One of the most important skills
for a young wizard to master

03:40.010 --> 03:45.450
is the art of spell improvisation
or ''make them ups.''

03:45.580 --> 03:50.020
Now, this is the ability to create
a brand-new spell off the top of one's head

03:50.150 --> 03:51.480
in the moment of urgent need.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.490
For example, Max,
what do you urgently need right now?

03:54.620 --> 03:56.560
Bagpipes.

03:57.590 --> 03:59.420
l wasn't listening.

04:01.230 --> 04:03.530
Alex, let's give it a try.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.530
Now, let's say
you haven't eaten for days

04:05.670 --> 04:07.570
and you're in desperate need
of a sandwich.

04:07.700 --> 04:08.760
What do you do?

04:09.270 --> 04:12.100
l walk over to our sandwich shop
and have Mom make me a sandwich.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.269
Okay, yes. But Mom's not here.

04:16.410 --> 04:17.470
Where's Mom?

04:17.610 --> 04:20.880
lt's not important where she is.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.480
She's gone. She left the country.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.810
She left the country?
Why? ls she okay?

04:26.990 --> 04:28.180
Yes, she's fine.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.780
Well, if she's fine, l don't see why
she couldn't make me a sandwich.

04:32.660 --> 04:33.720
All right.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.630
Here, l've already written
one down for you.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.390
Just read that and concentrate.

04:41.170 --> 04:46.230
''Satisfy my empty belly
Make me a peanut butter and jelly''

04:51.010 --> 04:52.410
You see what l just did there?

04:52.550 --> 04:56.110
l just illustrated
the dangers of spell improv.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.750
You have to choose your words carefully,
because in the wizard world,

05:03.890 --> 05:04.950
they take you literally.

05:05.090 --> 05:07.720
So when Max said,
''Make me a peanut butter and jelly,''

05:07.860 --> 05:09.890
they made him
a peanut butter and jelly.

05:13.700 --> 05:16.100
Oh, l get it. Let me try.

05:16.240 --> 05:20.070
Although l like such tasty snacks
l'd rather have my brother Max

05:21.440 --> 05:23.200
Hello.

05:25.980 --> 05:28.610
Hey, thanks for not eating me.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.110
Alex, you're a natural.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.080
Thanks. That wasn't even true.

05:34.890 --> 05:37.320
Dad, you think you could wrap this up?
l'm kind of in a hurry.

05:37.460 --> 05:39.360
Oh, really? That's not like you, Justin.

05:39.490 --> 05:41.550
You usually like to really marinate
in the magic.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.100
l know, but my math friends
are stopping by the Sub Station.

05:44.230 --> 05:48.100
For some stimulating conversation
about multiplying factorial equations.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.470
How do you know
about factorial equations?

05:51.440 --> 05:54.500
l don't know.
Oh, my goodness, you're contagious.

05:58.380 --> 05:59.900
Guys.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.040
That's them?
Where are all the math geeks?

06:03.180 --> 06:05.340
Alex, we prefer
the term arithmetic buffs.

06:06.490 --> 06:09.720
Now, if you'll excuse me, l have some
very important things to talk to them about.

06:09.860 --> 06:11.820
Things you wouldn't understand.

06:12.590 --> 06:15.790
And the big ball of yarn says,
''String theory.''

06:20.530 --> 06:22.760
l'm sorry. l couldn't help noticing,

06:22.900 --> 06:25.370
but did you just laugh
at something Justin Russo said?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.630
Yeah, l did.
l always laugh at what Justin says.

06:27.770 --> 06:29.210
He's hilarious.

06:31.310 --> 06:32.370
Really?

06:32.510 --> 06:35.380
And would you describe yourself
as a very boring person?

06:35.520 --> 06:36.570
No.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.880
l was voted ''least boring'' in the
school yearbook for three years in a row.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.580
Wouldn't that be ''most exciting''?

06:42.720 --> 06:45.380
Oh, no, that's Shawn Cunningham.
He's very exciting.

06:47.030 --> 06:50.020
Hey, you're kind of funny.
l'll vote for you next year.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.930
- Excuse me. Hi, l'm Alex.
- l'm Susan.

06:53.070 --> 06:55.830
Tell me you're talking about
something incredibly lame right now.

06:55.970 --> 06:57.600
Actually, we were just making plans

06:57.740 --> 07:02.070
to see Nights of the Halloween
Sorority Party Disaster 2,

07:03.240 --> 07:05.300
You mean
the new Ruby Donahue movie?

07:05.450 --> 07:07.970
Yeah. lt's the first horror movie
she's ever done.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.080
l love Ruby Donahue.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.190
Me too. She's a role model of mine.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.810
l plan to follow exactly in her footsteps.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.120
l'm gonna grow up
on a ranch in Montana,

07:17.260 --> 07:19.620
start my own charity for something sad,

07:19.760 --> 07:23.820
and then create my own
price-conscious beret line.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.300
Have you heard her new CD
of sensitive but mildly angry rock songs?

07:27.430 --> 07:28.560
- And she's like--
- No--

07:28.700 --> 07:30.830
Okay, Alex.

07:30.970 --> 07:33.840
My friends and l have some
very important things to discuss over here.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.030
Hey, Susan.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.870
Have you ever really considered
the concept of infinity? You know?

07:38.010 --> 07:41.280
- l was just thinking about that--
- l can lend you the Ruby Donahue CD.

07:41.410 --> 07:45.480
Thanks. Justin, l really like your sister.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.810
l like you too.
And that other ''least boring'' guy.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.590
- Oh, Zach Rosenblatt.
- Yeah, Zach.

07:53.730 --> 07:56.060
We should all hang out
and call each other the Zach Pack.

07:56.630 --> 07:58.390
Hey, Alex,
why don't we hang out over here?

07:58.530 --> 08:00.020
Why? l'm talking to Susan.

08:00.570 --> 08:02.590
You're never gonna be a member
of the Zach Pack.

08:03.270 --> 08:05.970
Don't act like that's a real thing.
l just made that up.

08:07.370 --> 08:10.340
You're my sister. You're not supposed
to be getting along with my friends.

08:10.480 --> 08:14.380
l know, but l like them.
They're way more normal than l expected.

08:14.510 --> 08:17.350
l'm as confused by all this as you are.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.250
Just stay away from us, okay?
l mean it.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.250
- Come on, Justin. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

08:23.390 --> 08:26.120
Oh, hey, Mom.
My friends and l are going out for a while.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.450
None of us have
legally enforceable curfews anymore,

08:28.600 --> 08:30.220
so it's anyone's guess
when we'll be back.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.419
Because l don't have to keep track
of time.

08:32.570 --> 08:33.760
You'll be back before 10.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.429
l do like to watch the local news.
They have a new weather girl.

08:36.570 --> 08:37.970
Oh, she's--

08:39.010 --> 08:40.169
Awkward.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.910
There he goes. They grow up so fast.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.280
Oh, honey. Are you all right?

08:50.420 --> 08:54.410
Yeah. He'll be off at technical school
before we know it.

08:55.060 --> 08:57.350
And Alex will be on leave
from the Air Force.

08:58.830 --> 08:59.880
What?

09:00.590 --> 09:04.660
lt's just the discipline you need.
Please just read the pamphlets.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.160
Oh, Maxy. Come here.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.240
Give your mama a hug.

09:11.370 --> 09:14.070
Promise me you'll never grow up
and leave me.

09:14.210 --> 09:16.370
But l'm supposed
to be taking out the garbage.

09:16.510 --> 09:18.600
Oh, no. You're our little baby.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.370
Your daddy will take out
the garbage.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.000
Me?

09:22.750 --> 09:24.180
Fine.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.910
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Oh, save it.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.390
Oh, Susan. Hi.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.560
Did you hear about
that new Ruby Donahue beret store

09:40.700 --> 09:41.790
that opened in Brooklyn?

09:41.940 --> 09:43.700
Yeah, me and Zach
were just talking about it.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.530
Yeah, they have
a ''gear for guys'' section.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.210
Because l was thinking
about going there later.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.540
Actually, l was thinking
about doing anything,

09:51.680 --> 09:52.940
because l don't have any plans.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.640
What about you?
What are you guys up to?

09:54.780 --> 09:56.250
Well, a bunch of us are going to see

09:56.380 --> 10:00.220
Night of the Halloween
Sorority Party Disaster 2.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.750
Do you wanna come with?

10:01.890 --> 10:03.950
Who? Me? Really? No, l couldn't.

10:04.090 --> 10:05.220
Oh, that's too bad.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.090
All right, l'll be there.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.820
Hey, guys.
How about the math homework?

10:11.970 --> 10:14.230
Talk about your exponential decay,
am l right?

10:15.300 --> 10:17.670
What are you doing here?

10:18.540 --> 10:20.200
Nothing. l was just on my way to class

10:20.340 --> 10:23.000
when l bumped into our friends
Susan and Zach.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.510
Our friends?

10:24.640 --> 10:27.700
Alex is gonna come to the movie with us.
lsn't that great news?

10:28.080 --> 10:30.240
Yeah.

10:30.420 --> 10:33.650
That's great news.
That's a totally unexpected surprise.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.520
We'll see you both tonight.

10:36.660 --> 10:39.820
Hey, do they make those berets in guys?

10:40.660 --> 10:44.260
Don't we have some really nice friends?

10:53.910 --> 10:56.900
Okay, what were you thinking?
Those are my friends.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.100
lt's an R-rated movie.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.270
- You're not old enough to get in.
- Neither are you.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.580
You don't worry about what l do
or don't do at the movies.

11:03.950 --> 11:05.350
What's that, a fake lD?

11:06.690 --> 11:07.780
Maybe.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.320
- Don't give--
- No.

11:13.130 --> 11:16.890
lt's just a piece of construction paper
and a clipping of that weather girl l like.

11:17.030 --> 11:19.360
You went in my room without asking.

11:21.170 --> 11:23.470
Look, Justin,
why do you care if l go to the movie?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.300
You're my sister. You're not supposed
to get along with my friends.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.140
l know it makes you uncomfortable,
but it's out of my hands.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.300
We don't choose our friends.

11:34.950 --> 11:36.580
Yes, we do.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.820
And for some reason,
you've chosen my friends.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.550
Well, maybe they've chosen me.

11:41.690 --> 11:43.820
l'm sorry,
but l'm going to that movie tonight.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.390
Wasn't that a fun haircut?

11:48.900 --> 11:52.700
You looked so handsome
sitting on that fire-engine chair.

11:54.530 --> 11:56.300
Help me.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.270
- No,
- No,

12:01.910 --> 12:05.940
Hey, remember when you used to give
Max piggyback rides up the stairs?

12:06.080 --> 12:08.210
That was like 50 pounds ago.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.410
Get on my back.

12:19.630 --> 12:20.680
Oh, Dad, Mom.

12:20.830 --> 12:22.890
Alex is trying to hang out with me
and my friends

12:23.030 --> 12:24.360
even though they're 1 7 years old.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.400
Seventeen-year-olds? Alex, you're 1 4.

12:28.130 --> 12:32.260
Listen, you'll have plenty of time
to hang out with 1 7-year-olds

12:32.410 --> 12:36.740
when you get into an advanced math class
like your brother.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.940
But l'll never get into Advanced Math.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.410
l know that, honey.

12:40.550 --> 12:43.450
That's why you're going
into the Air Force.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.820
Okay, l'm late for a movie.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.850
This is so not fair.

12:49.990 --> 12:52.620
Listen, if you really wanna do
something tonight,

12:52.760 --> 12:54.620
why don't you embrace
your fleeting childhood

12:54.760 --> 12:57.250
and take Max out
for pizza and Skee-Ball?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.660
l'm not gonna take Max out
to a bunch of dumb kid places.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.790
l'm way too old--

13:03.170 --> 13:04.230
You know what?

13:04.370 --> 13:07.070
Pizza and Skee-Ball it is.
Let's go, little brother.

13:07.940 --> 13:10.240
You're not taking me out
for pizza and Skee-Ball, are you?

13:10.380 --> 13:12.370
No, l am not.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.050
What are we doing here?

13:23.190 --> 13:25.160
l'm gonna get into a movie
with Justin's friends,

13:25.290 --> 13:27.190
and you're gonna go see
lcevarks again.

13:27.630 --> 13:29.360
Yeah, but l already saw lcevarks.

13:29.860 --> 13:32.460
Well, go crash that birthday party.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.800
l'll bet they're giving away
the paddle with the ball attached.

13:36.940 --> 13:38.200
l do like those.

13:40.270 --> 13:41.500
Hey, guys. Wait up. l made it.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.110
Oh, Alex. You're just in time. Come on.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.610
Well, hold on, youngster.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.270
Oh, it's okay. l'm with them.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.070
Are you old enough to see this movie?

13:50.880 --> 13:52.980
Oh, you flatter me.

13:55.050 --> 13:56.420
Here.

13:58.060 --> 14:00.890
You realize this says
you're 47 years old, right?

14:01.030 --> 14:03.660
And it's made out of construction paper.

14:05.030 --> 14:06.500
Can't you just look the other way?

14:06.630 --> 14:09.570
No. That would go against
the usher code.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.940
Would a jacket that fits
go against the usher code too?

14:13.740 --> 14:15.670
- Yes.
- l'm sorry, Alex.

14:15.810 --> 14:17.710
lf it makes you feel any better,
l'll take notes

14:17.840 --> 14:19.940
and give them to you afterwards
like l do for Justin.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.810
Like you do for Justin?

14:21.950 --> 14:23.140
Yeah.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.090
New high score.
That's what l am talking about.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.590
Alex?

14:28.720 --> 14:30.990
What are you doing?
You're not in the movie?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.560
No. l'm not old enough.

14:32.690 --> 14:34.720
And l don't plan
on breaking the law now.

14:34.860 --> 14:37.800
Part of being a mature adult
is knowing when to follow the rules.

14:37.930 --> 14:39.760
Well, part of being me
is ignoring the rules

14:39.900 --> 14:41.490
and doing whatever l want.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.400
l'm sensing you have a devious
and poorly thought-out plan

14:44.540 --> 14:46.800
to get into this Ruby Donahue movie.

14:46.940 --> 14:49.600
- l'm gonna ask you to leave me out of it.
- Gladly.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.840
l'm old enough to hang with

14:57.980 --> 15:00.820
Actress-model-spokeswoman,
Ruby Donahue

15:00.950 --> 15:07.290
So get me into Night of the
Halloween Sorority Party Disaster 2

15:13.730 --> 15:14.930
Where am l?

15:15.340 --> 15:17.630
You're at the
Zeta Theta Beta sorority house, silly.

15:17.770 --> 15:20.830
Home to the prettiest
and most popular girls on campus.

15:24.510 --> 15:26.340
ls that Ruby Donahue over there?

15:26.480 --> 15:29.710
No, silly.
That's Bambi, the sensitive one.

15:30.420 --> 15:33.440
Just stay in character
and scream when it's your turn.

15:36.290 --> 15:38.550
Oh, my goodness, l'm in the movie,

15:38.690 --> 15:40.390
You're just in time.

15:40.530 --> 15:45.050
We're about to have a super-fun
Halloween pillow fight in our pajamas.

15:45.830 --> 15:48.270
Aren't you a little old to be in a sorority?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.460
Aren't you a little young?

15:50.940 --> 15:52.000
Fair enough.

16:09.660 --> 16:12.020
What's the matter? lt's just the phone.

16:14.630 --> 16:17.690
Why did the music get all scary?

16:31.640 --> 16:34.440
Hey, what are you guys doing?
The movie's not even over yet.

16:34.580 --> 16:37.980
Justin, that movie is way too scary.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.020
There's some things in this life
that you can never un-see.

16:42.790 --> 16:45.380
Well, where's Alex? She said
she was gonna catch up with you guys.

16:45.530 --> 16:46.820
She never did.

16:46.960 --> 16:51.900
But weirdly enough, there's an actress
in the movie that looks just like her.

16:52.530 --> 16:54.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.270
She even sounded kind of like her.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.700
And she was wearing
the exact same outfit as her.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.099
Weird, right?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.970
Yeah, weird.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.450
What did you get
on that deductive reasoning test?

17:09.579 --> 17:10.780
A 99.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.609
Even weirder.

17:14.619 --> 17:17.520
Would you guys excuse me
for just one moment?

17:23.359 --> 17:25.390
Alex Russo has messed up
And put herself in a movie

17:25.530 --> 17:28.230
Put me also in that movie

17:30.540 --> 17:32.060
That didn't even sound like a spell.

17:32.210 --> 17:34.230
Okay, what rhymes with movie?

17:34.370 --> 17:38.330
Boovie, juvie, loovie. Plant.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.170
Plant.

17:40.950 --> 17:42.570
This is gonna take a while.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.220
Hey, you're Ruby Donahue.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.420
- Who are you?
- l'm Alex.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.860
Are you the evil sorority sister who's
come back from the grave to punish us

17:59.000 --> 18:02.900
for our cute but reckless destruction
of perfectly good pillows?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.500
What? No.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.730
l'm just a kid. l don't even know
what l'm doing in this scary movie.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.400
Me neither.
This was all my agent's idea.

18:12.710 --> 18:17.550
Oh, there's that music again.
Where is it coming from?

18:18.550 --> 18:21.280
This is the part where l run screaming
into the steam-filled showers,

18:21.420 --> 18:24.360
which have been left running
for no reason at all, so...

18:24.860 --> 18:26.650
Oh, okay.
Well, it was nice meeting you.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.020
You too.

18:37.970 --> 18:40.170
No, screaming and running
towards the masked villain

18:40.310 --> 18:42.800
is probably the worst way
to stay away from the masked villain.

18:42.940 --> 18:44.500
Right.

18:48.550 --> 18:50.180
,,,ln a groovy movie

18:50.320 --> 18:51.910
A little 1970s, but it worked.

18:52.050 --> 18:54.540
Justin. What are you doing here?

18:54.690 --> 18:57.710
What's it look like l'm doing?
l'm saving the day.

19:00.660 --> 19:03.030
Oh, who are they?

19:10.670 --> 19:12.470
My hero.

19:19.550 --> 19:24.210
Oh, no, Jerry.
Hugs and Mrs, is sold out.

19:24.350 --> 19:28.550
lt's supposed to be Hugh Grant's
most romantic role to date.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.520
Dear?

19:30.660 --> 19:32.620
That's bunk,

19:34.460 --> 19:35.590
That's bunk,

19:35.730 --> 19:37.560
That's bunk.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.360
- Jerry.
- Yes.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.160
You know, honey, l was thinking,
we should see lcevarks again.

19:45.370 --> 19:47.360
l'm telling you,
there's something weird going on

19:47.510 --> 19:50.100
in Night of the Halloween
Sorority Party Disaster 2,

19:50.240 --> 19:53.040
l know. l've seen that film 16 times.

19:53.180 --> 19:55.740
And then all of a sudden,
there are these new characters in it.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.010
Maybe it's a director's cut.

19:57.150 --> 20:00.780
Those characters of Alex and Justin
have such chemistry.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.850
lt's like they grew up together.

20:05.090 --> 20:06.390
Oh, miss?

20:06.530 --> 20:11.790
Two tickets for that disaster party
bingo Halloween thing, yeah.

20:19.610 --> 20:20.730
Justin, stand up.

20:20.870 --> 20:24.000
Forget about me, Alex. Save yourself.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.600
Seriously, Justin. Just stand up.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.370
Okay.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.810
- Oh, Justin, do something.
- Why me?

20:35.960 --> 20:38.620
- Because you're the older brother.
- What am l supposed to do?

20:38.760 --> 20:41.230
- lmprovise something.
- Right, okay.

20:41.730 --> 20:44.990
we've had enough of all this fear
So hurry up and get us out of here

20:46.830 --> 20:48.990
- What happened?
- We're in a basement.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.190
Yeah.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.600
ln the basement of the sorority house
in the movie.

20:52.740 --> 20:53.830
Dad wasn't kidding.

20:53.970 --> 20:56.440
When you improv a spell,
you gotta say exactly what you mean.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.840
He's still coming. Hurry!

20:59.980 --> 21:02.470
Don't yell at me. l'm trying to think.

21:06.220 --> 21:09.880
l'm scared of what might happen next
So take us to the Mondoplex

21:11.420 --> 21:12.650
Are we back?

21:13.190 --> 21:16.420
Yeah. lt's the theater lobby.
l think we're safe.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.160
Sorry l got you into this. Literally.

21:19.300 --> 21:22.500
lt's all right. lt was kind of fun
being in a sorority-girl movie.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.900
Yeah, well,
it wasn't what l expected at all.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.530
Well, maybe you were just trying
to grow up too fast.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.100
l guess l was.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.270
Sorry, and thanks for helping me out.

21:32.410 --> 21:34.140
l won't hang out
with your friends anymore.

21:34.550 --> 21:37.240
You won't tell anyone
l screamed like a girl?

21:37.380 --> 21:40.350
l probably will,
but that's what little sisters do.

21:40.790 --> 21:42.250
Oh, no, Justin. Look.

21:43.290 --> 21:44.690
She's coming right for us.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.820
Split up.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.860
They can't get both of us. Go.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.190
- lt's just us.
- Psych.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.450
Silly.
