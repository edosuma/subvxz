WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:03.549
<i>Last season, on Arrow... </i>

00:03.711 --> 00:07.012
I convinced you that we can have it all.
I was wrong.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.972
We have to let each other go.

00:09.134 --> 00:12.855
I have a village, too. Run by
a government strongman named Kovar.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.643
You'll go back to Russia,
and you can take on this Kovar.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.106
What are you gonna do now, Oliver?

00:21.939 --> 00:24.317
I know you wouldn't approve of what I did.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.610
<i>But you were always
better than me, Laurel.</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:28.871
<i>That is what I loved most about you.</i>

00:29.071 --> 00:30.664
<i>I thought about Laurel
and what she'd say.</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:32.286
<i>I think she'd tell me to get out.</i>

00:32.491 --> 00:33.868
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:37.129
<i>Take some time
away from this team,</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:39.339
<i>away from the city.</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:42.134
<i>I, Oliver Queen, do solemnly swear
to faithfully</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:46.301
and impartially perform and discharge
the duties of the office of mayor.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.150
- Your brother's late.
- "Late" is his "on time."

00:58.308 --> 01:01.152
And he's not just my brother,
he's the Mayor.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.905
Well, maybe someone should
remind him of that.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.859
Is there something
I can help you with, Captain?

01:10.988 --> 01:12.365
This evening is important, Miss Queen.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.917
And it's supposed to be the kickoff
to the Anti-Crime Initiative.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.835
And I don't think I need to tell you
how much this city...

01:17.035 --> 01:21.836
City needs the A.C.l. Yes, I know
and so does he so he will be here.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.718
He's just taking care
of a little business first.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.298
Blonde or redhead?

01:26.670 --> 01:29.014
Brunette actually.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.922
I found the bomb.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.804
No, no, no. That's not "a bomb,"
that's one, two, three, four bombs.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.394
I'm in the brains.
It's gonna take a while to disarm.

02:24.561 --> 02:29.067
- Do you think you can keep Machin busy?
- I don't think that'll be a problem.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.751
Does this mean you're not gonna kill me?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.249
What's a guy got to do
to get a little love?

02:42.454 --> 02:46.049
I only tried blowing up the city.
I mean, half of it.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.427
Sleep.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.264
Tell SCPD I left a present for them.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.470
Get away from that!

02:54.633 --> 02:56.260
I'm disarming it.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.807
It's handled. Overwatch?

03:02.516 --> 03:05.190
Yeah. Oh, man,

03:05.352 --> 03:07.400
that thing's just a really ugly piece
of modern art now.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.484
Aw. You gonna make a new friend?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.947
I thought I told you
to stay off the streets.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.867
- It's my city, too.
- You wanna help?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.034
Yeah.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.329
Then make a donation
to the police department.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.792
- And keep that elevated.
- Keep what elevated?

03:31.294 --> 03:33.171
I don't want to see you out here again.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.519
The Mayor will be making his official
statement on the Anti-Crime Initiative

03:46.685 --> 03:48.437
at the ceremony honoring
the Black Canary, but...

03:48.603 --> 03:51.482
But he can say a few words now.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.652
The A.C.l. is an important step
towards lowering crime in the city,

03:54.818 --> 03:57.196
but I'm not gonna consider it
without some major reform.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.488
What type of reforms?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.874
Uh, to start,
an investigation into allegations

04:01.032 --> 04:03.034
of widespread corruption
within the police department.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.125
Okay. Mayor Queen will elaborate
on all comments

04:06.288 --> 04:07.915
at the ceremony honoring the Black Canary.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.334
Thank you all very much.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.299
You realized you just
accused the police department

04:13.462 --> 04:15.339
of being corrupt
at the police department gala?

04:15.505 --> 04:16.552
I answered a question.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.764
Yeah, and you also just put blame
on the police department

04:19.926 --> 04:22.554
instead of taking responsibility
for the city's crime.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.770
- You know I'm taking responsibility.
- Yeah. As the other guy.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.937
But as the Mayor, it looks like
you're sleepwalking, okay?

04:30.103 --> 04:33.198
Showing up late again
is not helping that perception.

04:33.356 --> 04:37.156
Being the Mayor gives me access
to actionable intel as "the other guy."

04:37.319 --> 04:39.037
It's a means to an end.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.540
Well, it didn't start off
like that, Ollie.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.043
You wanted to become
and then became the Mayor

04:45.202 --> 04:48.081
- to actually be Mayor.
- Right. And then reality set in.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.250
Even if we weren't dealing with
a corrupt police department, and we are,

04:51.416 --> 04:53.794
or an electorate that thinks
I got all my political knowledge

04:53.960 --> 04:56.008
by binge-watching The <i>West</i> Wing,

04:56.171 --> 05:00.051
I still wouldn't be able to focus
on being the Mayor, Speedy.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.720
Because I'm flying solo
as "the other guy."

05:02.886 --> 05:05.059
Okay, nice try.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.224
Talk to the comptroller
about tax incentives.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.768
- And Councilman Garcia about sanitation.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.235
I also put the applications
for Deputy Mayor on your desk.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.239
I'm gonna go drink.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.729
What I do care about is what
you promised me if I won tonight.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.942
None of yours.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.902
What?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.369
<i>Whose'?</i>

07:02.797 --> 07:04.720
What are you two doing here?

07:04.883 --> 07:07.511
- It's late.
- That's what I told her,

07:07.677 --> 07:09.930
but she's been complaining
that the secondary processor

07:10.096 --> 07:11.769
keeps overclocking the GPU cache.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.276
It must be nice to have someone
down here who speaks Felicity.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.688
Well, I'm strictly repair and maintenance.
You guys are the vigilantes.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.528
Yeah, well, it's getting to be
an awfully big club.

07:20.690 --> 07:25.036
- What's this?
- A little dossier on Wild Dog.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.914
- "Wild Dog?"
- Yeah, you know, 'cause of his shirt.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.791
"Silly Dog" just didn't really
have the same ring to it.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.918
I suggested the "Wild."

07:32.077 --> 07:34.546
Right. And why do I need a dossier on him?

07:34.704 --> 07:37.628
So, I was thinking,
instead of putting an arrow in him,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.919
you might consider
bringing him into the fold.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.632
He shot him? You shot him?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.218
Okay, I know it's not the most enticing
of recruitment pitch plans.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.974
But there are plenty of candidates
willing to compensate

07:46.132 --> 07:48.055
for our ineffectual-slash-corrupt
police department.

07:48.218 --> 07:52.394
<i>Evelyn Sharp. Mr. Ski Goggles.
I'm still work-shopping that codename.</i>

07:52.555 --> 07:55.149
I'm not...
I'm not putting together a new team.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.777
Okay, well, in case you haven't noticed,
we're a little short-handed.

07:57.936 --> 08:01.065
Just for a little while.
John will come back.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.781
- Thea will come back.
- And if they don't?

08:04.943 --> 08:09.414
Then I will handle it.
Get some sleep. Both of you.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.709
SCPD! We have you surrounded.
Guns on the floor, now!

08:26.423 --> 08:28.846
What is this? These aren't our guys.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.432
No, they're Los Halcones.

08:32.679 --> 08:37.684
See, they tried to rob you tonight.
A shoot-out ensued.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.780
You killed them. They killed you.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.863
Drop the bodies,
empty the cash into the van.

08:52.574 --> 08:56.124
Bravo! Cleverness and efficiency.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.709
Very Robin Hood.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.467
But I doubt that
you'll be providing the poor

09:02.625 --> 09:07.426
with any of these ill-gotten gains.
Enlighten me.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.844
- I'm new in town.
- Kill this prig.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.640
Note! Any attempt to "kill this prig"

09:15.930 --> 09:18.729
will result in your swift demise.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.744
- Are you the one in charge?
- Go to hell.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.029
Oh...

09:31.488 --> 09:33.911
I'll take that as a "yes."

09:38.828 --> 09:40.375
Okay, gang-

09:53.760 --> 09:58.687
He said he was in charge.
Anybody else want to be in charge?

09:59.641 --> 10:03.987
No takers? Then I guess
it's gonna have to be me.

10:08.108 --> 10:12.830
Six DOA's. The dealer and his girlfriend,
two Los Halcones and one of our own.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.787
And who's lucky Number Six?
Keating.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.874
COD doesn't match the other vics,
who were all shot at close range,

10:20.036 --> 10:22.880
- but Keating...
- Blunt force trauma.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.379
And these, what?
Some sort of calling card?

10:25.542 --> 10:27.636
M.O. matches a skel named Tobias Church.

10:27.794 --> 10:32.095
According to his jacket, he and his crew
tore up Hub City and Blüdhaven.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.060
- And now he's here.
- Question is, what was Keating doing here?

10:36.469 --> 10:40.064
Nothing good.
He didn't call anything in.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.191
You think he's one of the bent cops?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.942
It doesn't matter. He's dead now.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.316
Well, Lance was a royal pain in the ass,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.701
but at least he kept
his department in line.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.864
Well, you could always give him
his badge back. He's back in town.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.499
Though word has it he took a few bumps
off the wagon on his way.

11:05.957 --> 11:09.427
All right, all right, all right.
All right.

11:15.717 --> 11:19.017
Knockin', that's not like you.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.146
Give us a minute.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.277
- How long you been back in town?
- Uh, couple of weeks.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.110
- Where's Donna?
- She's in Heaven.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.166
It's a casino in Vegas that
she's waitressing at these days. Not...

11:41.451 --> 11:44.921
- So you two aren't, uh...
- Oh, come on, Oliver.

11:45.079 --> 11:49.209
- Opposites attract, but not that much.
- Did you break up before...

11:49.459 --> 11:53.134
Well, you know,
not that it's any of your business.

11:53.296 --> 11:58.052
But you see, a drunk needs a reason
to stay sober.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.603
Fresh out, my friend.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.394
Well, Quentin...

12:03.556 --> 12:06.730
You know what? I don't know if you're in
a position to be judging me anyway.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.654
It's just me out there.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.491
Sometimes, saving the city
takes priority over running it.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.582
But that'll change
when the team gets back together.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.164
I can devote more time
to actually being the Mayor.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.456
That team could include you.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.714
Would I cover up
this beautiful face with a mask?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.344
That's not what I meant.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.339
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Oliver?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.679
I got a pretty full day ahead.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.473
You know about the ceremony?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.027
The city's gonna honor Laurel.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.859
Yeah.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.324
It's probably best I don't turn up
and embarrass her memory, then.

13:19.048 --> 13:24.100
You killed my best fighter.
You cost me lots of money.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.523
Your Russian's terrible.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.779
Your accent's American.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.242
So,

13:39.235 --> 13:41.784
what are you doing so far from home?

13:44.407 --> 13:49.038
Adam Hunt. Daniel Brickwell.
Frank Bertinelli.

13:49.203 --> 13:53.083
If I were you...
I'd put that back in my bag.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.923
Jason Brodeur. Leo Mueller...

13:56.085 --> 13:59.214
I said, put it back.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.974
You know what?

14:02.133 --> 14:04.386
This book, it intrigues me.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.348
It's the only reason
you are still breathing.

14:10.183 --> 14:14.780
It was my father's.
I'm waiting to use it.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.606
Waiting for what?

14:17.398 --> 14:18.820
To be ready.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.782
Well, I have some bad news for you.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.994
You're going to be dead before you are.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.293
You must be lost. City Hall is that way.

14:32.455 --> 14:35.004
Wanted to see
if you had info on our new player.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.294
And you wonder why your approval rating
is in the basement.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.589
- I don't wonder.
- How'd you ditch your security detail?

14:40.755 --> 14:43.133
I used to ditch John Diggle.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.640
Yeah. Tobias Church.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.518
AKA "Charon."

14:49.680 --> 14:53.776
The ferryman of Hades. Left gold coins on
the eyes on one of his victims last night.

14:53.976 --> 14:54.977
Well, well, well...

14:55.144 --> 14:56.737
I didn't fail every course
that I took in college.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.612
Warrants out for his arrest
on no less than 20 murders

14:59.774 --> 15:02.152
and those are just the ones
that they can connect him to.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.158
Mr. Church just became our top priority.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.539
"Our" is not going
to be enough for this guy.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.698
Okay. Felicity...

15:07.865 --> 15:10.664
Church runs with a crew.
And yours is not coming back.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.712
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.420
It's called "not being in denial."
You really ought to give it a try.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.587
Look, for the past five months,
you have been frozen in amber.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.927
Waiting for things to go back
to the way things were, they're not.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.721
You need to move forward.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.224
Especially, with guys like this
coming into town.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.273
Don't worry about him.
He's not gonna be staying very long.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.731
Just find a way
for me to find him, please.

15:41.190 --> 15:45.195
- Why isn't he at City Hall?
- That's a question I keep asking myself.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.159
- What are you workin' on?
- If Oliver's asking,

15:47.321 --> 15:50.541
- a location for our new baddie in town.
- And if he's not asking?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.416
Got an address for this guy.
You mind checking him out for me?

15:54.579 --> 15:56.206
I'm a happily married man, Felicity.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.875
Just see what you can find out.
Like, if he's <i>loco</i> or anything.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.215
We are callin' him the "Wild Dog."
Isn't that already settled?

16:02.378 --> 16:03.630
- Please?
- No.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.343
- Please.
- Okay. Fine.

16:09.177 --> 16:13.148
Cities are like gen pop. First day in,
you find the biggest guy in the yard,

16:13.306 --> 16:16.025
put him down. Hard. Sends a message.

16:16.184 --> 16:20.030
"Screw not with me."
So here we all are.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.737
Now who's the biggest guy in the yard?

16:24.609 --> 16:27.453
It's highly unlikely that
he will just come out to play.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.081
But it's like my younger brother
always said,

16:30.239 --> 16:32.412
"Don't fish without bait."

16:36.746 --> 16:39.420
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

16:39.582 --> 16:41.584
With all that ails our city,
I think it's fair to ask

16:41.751 --> 16:45.597
why we would spend time and money
to honor anyone.

16:46.047 --> 16:50.723
Why we would commission a statue
and have a ceremony to unveil it.

16:50.885 --> 16:54.606
Surely those resources
could be put to better ends.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.811
But I for one think
there is no better end than a reminder

16:58.976 --> 17:03.277
<i>of what we are capable of
when we stand together united.</i>

17:04.022 --> 17:07.242
<i>A reminder of those
who have made the ultimate sacrifice</i>

17:07.401 --> 17:09.449
<i>protecting our home.</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:15.001
<i>And a reminder that as long as
we keep their spirit in our hearts,</i>

17:17.036 --> 17:19.630
there will always be better days ahead.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.920
And as she reminds us,

17:25.461 --> 17:27.179
let us always remember her.

17:28.839 --> 17:33.811
Ladies and gentlemen, Laurel Lance.
The Black Canary.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.962
Whoa!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.256
- Felicity.
- We saw it.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.263
Why didn't Oliver fight back?
Sorry. Really dumb question.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.175
- Yeah, well, can we track the van?
- No, they shut down traffic cameras.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.891
And there're no satellites over the area.
We're blind.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.057
Okay, well, if that SCPD van was legit,
then the police are gonna be no help.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.565
Well, maybe this is a job for Speedy.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.897
Can you suit up
and hit the streets for intel?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.237
Can you maybe try to hack into
the police department

19:06.395 --> 19:08.864
and see if there is any
internal chatter we can go on?

19:09.732 --> 19:12.451
Gentlemen. And lady.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.621
This is not personal.

19:16.947 --> 19:20.872
I know it feels personal. But it is not.

19:21.035 --> 19:24.960
You are all here as a means to an end.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.086
I finally figured out a way
to make politicians useful.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.095
You want the Green Arrow?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.637
Ooh.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.262
Your Honor.

19:39.428 --> 19:44.275
Listen, the Green Arrow is not coming.
You're wasting your time.

19:44.433 --> 19:49.690
Just for the fun of it, how is it that you
know so much about Mr. Arrow?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.530
I have it on pretty good authority
that he's tied up right now.

19:54.652 --> 19:58.031
- Are you his buddy?
- I have connections.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.616
And I... Listen.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.043
You let these people go,

20:03.285 --> 20:06.289
and I'll make something happen.
Do we have a deal?

20:06.455 --> 20:09.129
No, we most certainly do not.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.794
I don't need your help, Mr. Mayor.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.966
Do you think I would go to
all this trouble without a plan?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.138
Yeah.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.648
But that's because I think you're stupid.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.362
Take Mr. Queen to a quieter place
and teach him some manners.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.162
You almost shot my friend in the head.

20:43.826 --> 20:44.827
Leave us.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.342
My book!

21:01.886 --> 21:05.516
Oliver Queen. My brother.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.861
Anatoly. It is very good to see you.

21:12.730 --> 21:13.731
What are you doin'?

21:17.026 --> 21:18.073
Ahh!

21:18.319 --> 21:22.449
I just dislocated thumbs. Useful if
getting tied to chair is to become habit.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.704
- This is going to hurt little.
- Son of a bitch!

21:27.870 --> 21:30.248
Yeah, with bit of practice
you can do yourself anytime.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.508
Anatoly, can't you bring
a knife next time?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.668
What is fun of that?

21:35.002 --> 21:37.846
My old friend, I thought you dead!

21:38.172 --> 21:42.803
Well, if you hadn't have shown up,
I probably would be.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.143
It's good to see you, <i>tovarisch.</i>

21:47.306 --> 21:48.774
What are you doing in Russia?

21:50.351 --> 21:52.774
I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

21:53.354 --> 21:57.951
If this is true, I did you no favor
by saving your life just now.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.582
We got a twenty
on Oliver's location.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.834
- Felicity and Curtis?
- Neither.

22:08.786 --> 22:12.586
Felicity says it's probably the work of
a "Tobias Church."

22:12.748 --> 22:15.592
And look, he's done his homework too
'cause he knows the Green Arrow is workin'

22:15.793 --> 22:19.297
with someone who's tapped into
the city's security cameras of...

22:19.588 --> 22:21.465
Okay, so, he's trying to call
the Green Arrow out.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.931
Yeah, except he doesn't know
he's already got him. Cute, huh?

22:25.094 --> 22:28.598
All right, well, you...
You need to go do something.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.601
Well, that was...
That was gonna be my line to you.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.442
For the first time in a...

22:36.605 --> 22:41.111
A long time, I'm really starting
to feel like myself again.

22:41.694 --> 22:46.120
I'm not a killer,
I'm not a vigilante, lam...

22:47.366 --> 22:49.869
I am a normal version of me.

22:51.287 --> 22:55.713
And I think just after everything
that happened with Laurel...

22:57.585 --> 23:01.465
I really needed to know
that life like this was even possible.

23:02.131 --> 23:05.635
And now that I do,
I don't wanna give it up.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.931
Yeah, yeah, I get
where you're coming from.

23:11.140 --> 23:16.021
I do. I lost my job, I lost my...
I lost my daughter, I lost my girl,

23:16.186 --> 23:19.656
and you know I just wanted to hit pause
on the world, you know?

23:20.149 --> 23:23.073
- Yeah.
- But then I, uh...

23:23.235 --> 23:25.488
You know, what?
I listened to Oliver's speech.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.748
Well, you know, that's
when I realized that I, I can't do that.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.751
I can't hit pause on it when I gotta
get on with my life, you know?

23:37.374 --> 23:40.173
Even if that life
isn't what I want it to be.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.019
I didn't vote for you.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.432
That's okay. I ran unopposed.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.361
"Mayor Handsome," they call you.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.657
Not for long, though.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.367
If you hit me again...

24:15.371 --> 24:18.716
- I'm gonna kill you.
- You're delusional.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.797
You're zipcuffed to that chair.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.944
- Please, don't...
- I'm sorry. But nobody can know my secret.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.871
<i>- I thought you retired.</i>
- Yeah, <i>me too.</i>

25:03.043 --> 25:04.386
Speedy!

25:04.670 --> 25:08.265
There are wires. They've been rigging
explosives to set up a kill cordon.

25:08.424 --> 25:11.268
- A what?
- If we try to get down there

25:11.427 --> 25:14.852
- we're gonna blow everything up.
- I can't just leave them there.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.105
No!

25:25.315 --> 25:27.283
We'll come back for them.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.375
Felicity's already looking
for the power station blueprints.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.536
Now, if we can get past
that kill cordon, we...

25:37.703 --> 25:41.298
Then we can kill all of Church's men
instead of just those guys?

25:41.457 --> 25:44.961
- Excuse me?
- I saw you break that guy's neck, Ollie.

25:45.127 --> 25:48.256
You murdered him, okay. I thought
you weren't doing that anymore.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.892
Maybe if I showed a little less restraint,
Laurel might still be alive.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.304
Okay, you cannot keep hiding behind that.

25:54.470 --> 25:57.019
And you know that's not
what she would have wanted.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.651
You know, Thea, you told me
that the dead don't want anything.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.564
Now, I could have killed Damien Darhk
before that night at Iron Heights.

26:05.731 --> 26:09.326
I had multiple chances to do so.
And I didn't.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.241
Because I thought
that taking the high road

26:12.404 --> 26:14.657
was more important than saving lives.

26:14.823 --> 26:19.420
And that is a mistake
that I will never ever make again.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.673
I wouldn't call not killing people
a mistake, Ollie...

26:22.831 --> 26:25.300
I would. Because when I did take
Darhk down for good,

26:25.459 --> 26:29.009
I had to confront the fact
that Malcolm Merlyn was right.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.684
Either I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary

26:35.135 --> 26:36.682
or I shouldn't be out there at all.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.851
Which is exactly why I can't be.
I won't ever again.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.736
- Thea...
- No, no.

26:45.354 --> 26:49.825
Ollie, lam sorry, but I wanna honor
Laurel just as much as you do.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.704
Just not like this. And I don't care
what your reasons are,

26:53.862 --> 26:57.366
putting killing back on the table
is a huge step backwards.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.418
And I don't want anything to do with it.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.713
- Sorry that you had to hear that.
- Hazard of the job. You okay?

27:09.878 --> 27:13.382
I just... Seeing Thea in the suit, it made
me feel like everything was gonna

27:13.549 --> 27:14.721
get back to normal.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.227
Well, I'm running out of different ways
to tell you that it's not.

27:17.386 --> 27:22.392
Hey. Look, being a vigilante
is not just putting on a mask

27:22.558 --> 27:26.608
and thinking up a codename.
These people are amateurs, Felicity.

27:26.770 --> 27:30.616
You really think that they're gonna
replace Dig or Thea or Laurel?

27:30.774 --> 27:34.904
They couldn't do that if I wanted them to.
And I don't want them to.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.290
They're already out there, Oliver.
Because of you.

27:38.448 --> 27:41.918
- Inspired by you.
- After what happened with Laurel,

27:42.077 --> 27:44.626
how can you ask me to put
more people in the crosshairs?

27:44.788 --> 27:47.291
Lam not the one who is asking.

27:47.457 --> 27:50.427
Or do you not remember the promise
that you made to Laurel before she died?

27:50.586 --> 27:53.305
Laurel was thinking about the future.
You need to think about yours.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.592
Right now, I need to think of ways
to stop Tobias Church.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.806
- Oliver...
- So, you let me know

27:58.969 --> 28:01.188
when you find a way around
the kill cordon.

28:08.770 --> 28:12.400
Nothing ever simple with you,
Oliver Queen.

28:12.566 --> 28:15.615
You survive Lian Yu, twice, you say.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.781
And instead of going home,
you come to mine.

28:18.947 --> 28:23.623
Well, I didn't know this was your town.
Or that you're a Bratva boss...

28:23.785 --> 28:27.790
- <i>Avtoritet.</i> It's like a captain.
- Right.

28:28.790 --> 28:33.216
- What business do you have with Kovar?
- It's a promise that I made.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.631
What, that you'll kill him?
Or that you die trying?

28:35.797 --> 28:37.720
'Cause second's much more likely.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.558
Okay, Anatoly, you just need to tell me
if you can get me close to him.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.436
Kovar has army. Government soldiers.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.192
It's very dangerous.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.029
You're sure you want to risk your life
for this promise?

28:58.820 --> 29:03.200
- "The shark that does not swim, drowns."
- What does that mean?

29:03.700 --> 29:06.249
I know real reason why you not go home.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.206
You're not swimming.

29:09.998 --> 29:14.595
This business with Kovar.
It's old promise. It's in past.

29:15.504 --> 29:19.680
You need to move forward, my friend.
You need to move ahead. Move on.

29:24.930 --> 29:29.686
All right. But the only way will kill you.

29:31.687 --> 29:32.904
- Curtis?
- Okay.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.316
This is the craziest
super-hero scavenger hunt

29:35.482 --> 29:37.860
I have ever been on.
Not that I've ever been on any, but...

29:38.026 --> 29:40.700
Wild Dog isn't a "super hero."
He's a vigilante.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.365
You are really gonna have to explain
the distinction to me.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.876
Either way, we'd have better luck
with an ad in the paper.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.377
No one reads the classifieds anymore.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.959
Why don't you just come on back,
and we'll figure out our next move.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.374
You got it.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.463
What do you want?

30:01.341 --> 30:03.935
<i>Hey, this is John. Leave a message.</i>

30:04.303 --> 30:06.351
Hey, John. Um...

30:07.556 --> 30:10.400
I hope that everything's going well
over there.

30:12.519 --> 30:17.070
Listen, no pressure, but give me
a call back when you get a chance. I...

30:17.399 --> 30:20.494
I have a question and I figure
you'd probably have an answer.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.450
Be well.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.038
Lonely at the top, Mr. Mayor?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.625
Actually, being the Mayor
isn't the job that's lonely.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.249
- Thea?
- Thea's not coming back.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.839
Neither is John.
There's a Russian proverb,

30:40.297 --> 30:42.345
been thinking about it a lot recently.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.855
"The shark that does not swim

30:53.352 --> 30:54.945
"drowns."

30:55.604 --> 30:57.948
You don't move forward, you die.

30:58.106 --> 31:02.612
But listen, you will die if you try takin'
on this Tobias Church by yourself.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.280
There's no more team, Quentin.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.119
And I can't trust anyone
on the department.

31:06.323 --> 31:09.122
Then don't. Just trust these guys.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.129
Lieutenant Conahan.
I trained him back in the day.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.965
The guy is so clean,
he doesn't even double park.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.175
And he's vouched for each
of these officers.

31:21.338 --> 31:24.217
- To do what?
- To help you

31:24.758 --> 31:27.307
- whatever way we can.
- "We"?

31:29.054 --> 31:31.227
Look, I don't know
any Russian proverbs, all right?

31:31.390 --> 31:34.143
- But both of us have got to move on.
- Yeah.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.362
Boy, I thought
that was gonna be a bigger fight.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.239
That's what Laurel would've wanted.

31:43.026 --> 31:46.326
After tonight,
I realize anything can happen,

31:48.407 --> 31:50.660
which is why I need you to
make me a promise.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.584
- Anything.
- Please...

32:01.253 --> 32:03.597
Please don't let me be the last Canary.

32:04.131 --> 32:08.557
That way, a part of me will always be
out there with you.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.351
I promise.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.162
There's nothin' out there.
Gonna grab a smoke.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.658
We're in.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.121
<i>Copy</i> that.

32:32.325 --> 32:35.374
<i>I'm gonna disarm the bombs. Fisher'll take
the others and get the councilmen.</i>

32:35.537 --> 32:39.713
All right, watch your back, all right?
I got you from here.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.923
And where do they think "here" is,

32:42.085 --> 32:44.179
- exactly?
- I forgot to mention that.

32:44.337 --> 32:45.338
<i>I</i> am jealous.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.221
<i>I've been trying to get Oliver
to work with a team for weeks now.</i>

32:48.425 --> 32:50.894
- They're not a team.
- Well, you can look it up.

32:51.052 --> 32:54.647
A team is, "a group of persons
associated with a joint action."

32:59.895 --> 33:01.067
Duck.

33:04.566 --> 33:05.909
Duck.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.697
Goose.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.413
That's more like it.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.759
Hey! Don't worry!

33:30.926 --> 33:34.976
After I kill you,
I will let the hostages go. I promise.

34:01.831 --> 34:02.832
<i>Taking heavy fire.</i>

34:02.999 --> 34:04.797
<i>- Fisher?
- I need backup.</i>

34:04.960 --> 34:06.678
Conahan, Fisher's catching heat.
Can you assist?

34:06.836 --> 34:08.554
<i>Negative.
We got a bigger problem.</i>

34:08.713 --> 34:10.681
Church has wired the conductor.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.764
The conductor is in the center of... If it
goes, the whole building's gonna blow.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.600
<i>You have to get out of there.</i>

34:16.804 --> 34:18.681
Not without Church.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.815
The whole power plant is gonna go up.
There's nothing I can do to stop it.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.190
Get them out of here.

34:27.357 --> 34:28.984
- I'll disarm the cordon.
- I got it.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.618
Overwatch!

34:39.119 --> 34:40.917
Hostages are safe.
You have maybe five seconds.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.229
Hey. Keep her flying.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.261
Good morning.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.226
I had intended to state my position
on the Anti-Crime Initiative

35:40.388 --> 35:42.891
during the city's tribute
to the Black Canary

35:43.058 --> 35:45.026
but that speech was cut short.

35:45.185 --> 35:48.064
In the intervening days,
I have refined my position.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.073
<i>Now, I have been reluctant
to embrace the A.C.l.</i>

35:51.232 --> 35:54.736
<i>because of widespread corruption
within our police department.</i>

35:54.903 --> 35:58.407
But these four officers have shown me
and the entire city

35:58.573 --> 36:02.623
that there are still good men
and women in the SCPD.

36:02.786 --> 36:06.165
Today, I'm announcing the formation
of the Anti-Crime Unit.

36:06.331 --> 36:09.005
These four officers will report
directly to me.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.303
And by working together,

36:11.586 --> 36:15.466
we will begin the process
of saving our city.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.229
Wanna thank you all for comin' out.

36:21.388 --> 36:24.392
<i>Wanna thank you all
for deciding to hear my vision.</i>

36:24.557 --> 36:28.653
The Green Arrow
cannot be stopped. Unless...

36:28.812 --> 36:34.114
Unless we all work together.
Under a singular command.

36:34.275 --> 36:38.951
- And I suppose that leader'd be you?
- You need someone from the outside.

36:39.364 --> 36:43.961
I know this because it took me less than
12 hours to get inside your organizations.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.125
All of them.

36:46.413 --> 36:49.542
What's that mean? "Get inside"?

36:56.548 --> 36:59.597
It means that, Mr. Bertinelli.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.179
What are you still doing here?

37:02.345 --> 37:04.939
Thought you'd be out celebrating
after your big win.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.691
Well, it wasn't exactly a win.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.319
You went from being the Do-Nothing Mayor
to the Rockstar Mayor

37:09.477 --> 37:12.777
in under 24 hours.
I would say that that qualifies.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.408
- Church is still out there.
- I'm not worried about that.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.194
What with your new unit of super-cops

37:17.360 --> 37:19.112
and the new team of vigilantes
you're gonna be recruiting,

37:19.279 --> 37:21.498
Church is gonna see
the inside of a cell in no time.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.200
- I see what you did there.
- What did I do?

37:23.366 --> 37:25.869
You talked about the new team
like it's a done deal.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.877
Oh, that. Well, I just thought,
since you decided to

37:30.290 --> 37:34.670
"keep swimming" as mayor you might do
the same as Green Arrow.

37:35.837 --> 37:36.838
You might be right.

37:37.005 --> 37:40.350
Lance told me about the Russian proverb,
by the way. Very poetic. Wait,

37:42.761 --> 37:46.436
did you just say I might be right?
Are you okay?

37:48.767 --> 37:51.611
- Been looking into your guy.
- Wild Dog?

37:51.978 --> 37:55.448
- Says here, his name is Rene Ramirez.
- Yeah, but "Wild Dog" is much scarier.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.281
- So by "looking into," does that mean...
- I'm thinking of recruiting him.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.070
- Good.
- You better.

38:00.820 --> 38:05.326
Because if you don't, I have no idea
what I went through this for.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.670
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- I was looking for Mr. Dog,

38:08.828 --> 38:12.002
and then I was jumped by two insanely
aggressive guys with knives.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.382
Do you remember
what they looked like?

38:13.541 --> 38:16.385
Yes, and I will tell you everything
on one condition.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.965
You recruit me too.

38:21.549 --> 38:22.892
Okay.

38:23.927 --> 38:27.557
Kovar face many threats.
Many people want to kill him.

38:27.722 --> 38:32.444
Only people who have power
to get past his army are Bratva.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.989
So,

38:36.898 --> 38:39.902
first you say that this is gonna kill me,

38:41.194 --> 38:43.913
and now it looks like
you wanna initiate me.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.877
Unless you are careful,
it will be one and same.

38:51.538 --> 38:54.758
Okay, Anatoly.

38:55.917 --> 38:58.170
So, I survive this.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.425
Then I'm Bratva.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.600
You survive this,

39:04.759 --> 39:08.855
you can begin process of becoming Bratva.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.654
Hey, buddy. How you doin'?

39:24.821 --> 39:26.243
Well,

39:26.406 --> 39:30.411
besides feeling like I've got the worst
case of déjà vu ever, not bad.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.545
<i>- How about you? You still the mayor?
- Yeah.</i>

39:32.704 --> 39:34.456
They haven't voted me out yet, so...

39:34.622 --> 39:37.375
Yeah, well, give it a little bit of time
and they'll come to their senses.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.842
I got your message. You all right?

39:41.004 --> 39:43.678
I'm all right. I just, I...

39:43.840 --> 39:46.593
I wanted to bounce something off of you.
And get your perspective.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.976
Okay? On?

39:50.555 --> 39:53.525
Felicity thinks that it's time
we put together a new team.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.444
And you want to know if I think
that's a good idea?

39:56.603 --> 39:57.820
I do.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.820
I think it is.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.829
Wasn't exactly the response
you were looking for, right?

40:07.238 --> 40:08.911
No, no.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.829
But I'm not surprised. Uh...

40:15.663 --> 40:16.915
I need to make peace with the fact

40:17.123 --> 40:18.841
that things aren't gonna go back
to the way they were.

40:19.584 --> 40:23.680
- So, does that include you and Felicity?
- I don't know.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.660
- Mmm. You're a magician.
- Tough day?

40:49.030 --> 40:51.032
Mmm, just long.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.168
Better now.

41:09.342 --> 41:12.687
Hey, honey. Yeah, I'm headed home.

41:12.845 --> 41:15.314
Yeah, it was a good day. It was real good.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.019
Diapers and formula. You got it.
I'll be home in a bit.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.990
How you doing? Help you with somethin'?

41:51.217 --> 41:53.436
Green Arrow?

41:54.262 --> 41:57.266
No. I'm not Green Arrow.
