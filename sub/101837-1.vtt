WEBVTT

00:39.515 --> 00:42.309
I need a ladder on the back,
as well as any hot spots, okay?

01:02.287 --> 01:03.288
Here's your water.

01:20.889 --> 01:22.266
Let's go, fellas. Let's go!

01:23.892 --> 01:26.061
Oh, man,
you didn't have to be here tonight.

01:26.895 --> 01:28.063
It's okay, Chief.

01:28.564 --> 01:29.940
- Sure?
- I'm good.

01:31.817 --> 01:32.818
Stay close, will you?

01:32.901 --> 01:34.737
Make sure he doesn't do
anything reckless.

01:34.820 --> 01:35.902
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go, men!

01:35.904 --> 01:37.906
- Let's get that van rolling.
- It's leaking out.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.533
Let's take it in
and get a good knockdown.

01:39.616 --> 01:40.743
All right.

01:42.244 --> 01:43.245
Come on, Tom.

01:43.912 --> 01:45.456
No place else I'd rather be.

01:48.917 --> 01:50.919
- What's the matter with you, man?
- What?

01:51.962 --> 01:53.630
Tiffany's back in the hospital.

01:53.922 --> 01:55.174
Cancer.

02:01.638 --> 02:02.639
Ma'am.

02:02.765 --> 02:03.766
No!

02:03.974 --> 02:05.768
My daughter's inside!

02:05.934 --> 02:07.770
My daughter's inside!

02:07.852 --> 02:09.103
There's a girl inside!

02:09.605 --> 02:10.814
Chief, I have point.

02:10.939 --> 02:11.940
You want to do that, bud?

02:12.775 --> 02:13.776
Let's do it.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.861
All right, let's do it.

02:24.620 --> 02:25.954
Please!

02:26.330 --> 02:28.999
My best man's in there
looking for her right now.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.001
<i>I found a way in.</i>

02:31.126 --> 02:32.419
<i>David, you with me?</i>

02:32.544 --> 02:33.962
Always, brother.

02:37.091 --> 02:38.842
Ma'am, it's gonna be all right.

02:38.967 --> 02:39.968
Come on, ma'am.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.355
<i>First floor is clear.</i>

02:51.689 --> 02:52.690
<i>We're going upstairs.</i>

02:52.815 --> 02:54.983
Find the girl
and get the heck out of there!

03:10.833 --> 03:12.418
<i>Push the backdraft, Tom.</i>

03:13.669 --> 03:14.795
<i>Don't get reckless.</i>

03:17.589 --> 03:19.005
It's getting real hot in there, Chief.

03:19.007 --> 03:20.384
You've got to pull them
out of there, Chief.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.009
- Oh, no! No!
- Chief! Look at it up there, man!

03:23.011 --> 03:24.263
Just hold fast.

03:24.388 --> 03:26.012
Chief, if you're not
going to pull them out,

03:26.014 --> 03:27.683
then at least
let Devon and me in, too.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.435
- Yeah.
- <i>We got her.</i>

03:30.227 --> 03:31.228
Yeah.

03:31.353 --> 03:33.022
- <i>We're coming out.</i>
- He's coming out.

04:05.387 --> 04:08.849
<i>♪ We've no less days</i>

04:08.932 --> 04:13.062
<i>♪ To sing God's praise</i>

04:13.520 --> 04:20.277
<i>♪ Than when we first begun ♪</i>

04:22.071 --> 04:23.864
It's good to be
in the house of the Lord.

04:23.947 --> 04:24.948
Amen.

04:26.658 --> 04:29.453
Today, I would like to speak to you
from the book of <i>Ecclesiastes.</i>

04:30.120 --> 04:33.248
<i>Ecclesiastes</i> 3, verses 1 through 8.

04:33.832 --> 04:36.502
We'll be starting this week
our nine-week sermon series

04:36.627 --> 04:39.755
called "There is a season."

04:40.547 --> 04:41.840
"A time to be born

04:43.967 --> 04:45.094
"and a time to die,

04:46.720 --> 04:48.097
"a time to plant

04:49.264 --> 04:50.891
"and a time to uproot,

04:52.267 --> 04:53.519
"a time to kill

04:55.104 --> 04:56.105
"and a time to heal,

04:57.940 --> 04:59.692
"a time to tear down

05:01.110 --> 05:02.569
"and a time to build,

05:06.532 --> 05:07.574
"a time to weep..."

05:09.493 --> 05:10.953
Well, you know the rest.

05:11.036 --> 05:14.206
And you do not want me
to sing that song, I promise you.

05:15.874 --> 05:19.044
Today's sermon is going to focus
on suffering.

05:20.045 --> 05:21.046
Pain.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.133
And the healing love

05:25.050 --> 05:26.135
of God's miracles.

05:27.928 --> 05:28.929
Where?

05:31.724 --> 05:33.600
Uh, where what, friend?

05:33.726 --> 05:35.185
Where are these miracles?

05:36.395 --> 05:38.772
When will he come down
from his golden throne

05:38.897 --> 05:40.315
and touch the people?

05:41.025 --> 05:42.026
I'm sorry?

05:42.151 --> 05:43.402
You sing songs,

05:44.153 --> 05:47.906
give money, time,
blood, sweat and tears.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.494
You talk about faith
and being faithful.

05:54.705 --> 05:57.583
But when it comes down
to our absolute desperate needs,

05:58.375 --> 06:00.002
where is the Almighty

06:01.545 --> 06:03.172
to actually help the people?

06:05.382 --> 06:06.925
Where is the King?

06:09.928 --> 06:11.180
I know there are questions,

06:11.597 --> 06:13.265
- but...
- You have no idea.

06:13.849 --> 06:15.225
He's not just a king.

06:16.185 --> 06:18.562
You know,
he's also a suffering servant.

06:20.064 --> 06:21.732
He's a God that knows

06:22.191 --> 06:24.860
our pain
and is acquainted with our grief.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.196
Then what can I even hope for?

06:29.281 --> 06:33.369
Faith gives substance
to what you hope for.

06:34.370 --> 06:35.621
I'm all out of faith.

06:37.206 --> 06:38.624
You have to believe.

06:39.124 --> 06:41.208
You have to believe
with all of your heart.

06:41.210 --> 06:42.294
There can be no doubt.

06:43.295 --> 06:46.965
Doubt is the yeast
that spoils the whole loaf.

06:50.677 --> 06:51.678
Believe that!

06:51.804 --> 06:53.305
Come on, get this guy out of here.

07:07.986 --> 07:11.115
Tom, don't let her get
too close to the geese.

07:13.409 --> 07:14.410
Back up.

07:15.619 --> 07:16.620
There you go.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.330
The parade starts in an hour.

07:18.455 --> 07:19.456
Let's go.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.334
Come on, shorty,
let's go to the parade.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.561
Tiffany, look, who is it?

07:41.103 --> 07:43.022
It's one
of Daddy's work trucks.

07:43.105 --> 07:45.274
That's right,
it's one of Daddy's fire trucks.

07:45.315 --> 07:48.027
Say, "Hi, Mr. Steve. Hi, Mr. Devon."

07:50.237 --> 07:51.488
You remember Donnie Piper?

07:51.697 --> 07:53.449
Stop, I still feel bad about that.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.660
You know, that was so mean of you,

07:56.744 --> 07:59.580
but if it wasn't for Donnie Piper,
we wouldn't be together.

07:59.705 --> 08:01.123
Who's Donnie Piper?

08:01.832 --> 08:02.833
Don't.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.293
- David?
- Okay, okay.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.294
So, Tom and me
were watching this very parade.

08:07.296 --> 08:09.757
We were 14 years old,
but it's 20 years ago, right?

08:09.882 --> 08:11.675
- Eighteen years ago.
- Eighteen years ago.

08:11.759 --> 08:15.596
So, there's this guy, Donnie Piper.
He's been picking on Sarah in school.

08:15.721 --> 08:17.473
He kept calling me "church girl,"
making fun of Christians,

08:17.556 --> 08:19.892
that sort of thing.
I can totally handle it,

08:19.975 --> 08:23.310
but here comes Mr. Muscles
and his best friend David.

08:23.312 --> 08:26.398
So, we catch up to Donnie
in the alley and we pie him.

08:27.066 --> 08:28.315
You what?

08:28.317 --> 08:30.317
Well, you know, Tom,
he's got a whipped cream pie,

08:30.319 --> 08:32.319
he sticks it, "boom,"
right in his face. So, here is Donnie,

08:32.321 --> 08:33.739
he's trying to wipe
pie off of his face,

08:33.864 --> 08:35.074
I come running around the corner,

08:35.157 --> 08:36.617
"bang," I stick another pie
in his face.

08:36.742 --> 08:38.952
So, now Tom, he grabs him,

08:39.077 --> 08:42.288
he throws him into the middle
of the parade, and he yells,

08:42.956 --> 08:44.917
"Hey, look, it's the Pied Piper!"

08:46.794 --> 08:48.335
Oh, you two are terrible.

08:48.337 --> 08:49.963
We were. We were. It's true.

08:51.340 --> 08:53.759
So, that's when
you fell in love with him?

08:53.926 --> 08:55.342
Oh, no. No, no.

08:55.344 --> 08:56.804
No, no, no.
So, a couple of days later,

08:56.929 --> 08:57.930
I'm coming home from school,

08:58.013 --> 08:59.306
I cut through the lot.

08:59.348 --> 09:01.348
There is Donnie,
but he's got his big brother with him.

09:01.350 --> 09:03.894
Starts roughing me up a little bit,
gives me a black eye.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.646
So now, I go to see Tom,

09:05.771 --> 09:08.355
Tom sees me with a black eye,
and Tom says...

09:08.357 --> 09:10.109
- "Well, I'll get him."
- Yeah.

09:10.192 --> 09:12.736
So, now, Tom, he's going
all around the neighborhood,

09:12.820 --> 09:14.613
he's looking
for Donnie's big brother, right?

09:14.738 --> 09:15.906
So, did you find him?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.658
I did. He gave me a black eye, too.

09:18.659 --> 09:22.538
So, here he is,
sitting in the grass, crying.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.373
I was not crying.

09:24.540 --> 09:26.373
He looked so pathetic.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.627
He had no one but his best friend
sitting next to him.

09:29.002 --> 09:32.631
And that,
that is when she stole my best friend.

09:32.756 --> 09:34.425
That's when I fell in love with him.

10:20.471 --> 10:22.931
Firefighter stuff
is just a stepping stone.

10:23.432 --> 10:25.517
I figure it's just a matter of time

10:25.934 --> 10:30.439
before I get picked for one of those
hottest firefighter calendars.

10:30.606 --> 10:33.442
And then, off to the races, baby.

10:34.443 --> 10:37.071
But, hey, you know,
it pays the bills, right?

10:38.280 --> 10:40.866
California,
that's where you want to be.

10:42.493 --> 10:43.952
You know, I bet, as firemen,

10:44.078 --> 10:46.955
we would totally outrank
everybody on beach patrol.

10:47.456 --> 10:49.208
I mean, can you imagine

10:49.291 --> 10:52.753
if they let me walk around all day
with my shirt off?

10:52.878 --> 10:55.255
Man, it would cause a riot.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.508
Hey, will you excuse me, Steve?

10:58.467 --> 10:59.718
Okay, sure.

10:59.885 --> 11:02.137
So, Kevin, he meets this girl, right?

11:02.262 --> 11:03.931
Real California type...

11:06.475 --> 11:09.061
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

11:09.561 --> 11:12.481
six, five, four,

11:12.690 --> 11:15.484
three, two, one.

11:15.651 --> 11:17.736
Happy New Year!

11:30.165 --> 11:31.500
Come on, let's go, bath time.

11:34.586 --> 11:35.587
Sarah?

11:37.381 --> 11:39.383
Well, I'm going to do
some blood tests,

11:39.508 --> 11:43.137
I'm going to get a CT done.
And if I need to, a follow-up MRI.

11:43.262 --> 11:45.764
We'll just hold her in observation
for right now.

11:45.889 --> 11:49.518
Let her relax, get some fluids in her
and we'll go from there, okay?

11:52.146 --> 11:54.398
<i>Why does Mommy
keep getting sick?</i>

11:55.107 --> 11:56.108
<i>I don't know.</i>

11:56.275 --> 11:57.818
<i>Will she be better soon?</i>

11:58.485 --> 12:00.529
<i>We're going to
keep praying for that every day.</i>

12:02.114 --> 12:04.199
Do you have any questions,
Mr. Hatcher?

12:08.495 --> 12:09.496
Mr. Hatcher?

12:12.541 --> 12:13.542
Uh...

12:14.543 --> 12:17.921
The treatment is aggressive,
but at this stage...

12:18.964 --> 12:21.175
Her doctor said it was just migraines.

12:21.425 --> 12:23.552
The hospital has counselors on hand.

12:24.303 --> 12:26.555
And there are also some

12:27.723 --> 12:30.017
wonderful cancer support groups, too.

12:32.644 --> 12:35.397
I'll do everything I can
to help her, Mr. Hatcher,

12:36.648 --> 12:37.816
including pray for her.

12:39.651 --> 12:42.571
I thought doctors weren't supposed
to talk about religion.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.574
I'm not ashamed to admit
that I'm a follower of Christ.

12:55.876 --> 12:56.877
Tom.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.213
What is it, babe?

13:00.422 --> 13:01.632
Can you feel him?

13:03.175 --> 13:04.176
Feel who?

13:04.968 --> 13:06.053
God.

13:07.262 --> 13:08.263
His love.

13:08.597 --> 13:09.598
Can you feel it?

13:10.599 --> 13:12.601
- Sarah, I love you so...
- Mommy?

13:13.602 --> 13:15.396
Hi, honey.

13:15.479 --> 13:16.814
Mommy, can we...

13:17.106 --> 13:18.107
Mommy?

13:18.607 --> 13:19.608
Sarah!

13:19.775 --> 13:20.776
Sarah, no!

13:21.318 --> 13:22.903
Doctor, nurse, please!

13:23.612 --> 13:24.738
We need help here!

13:25.614 --> 13:26.740
She's not responding!

13:26.990 --> 13:29.326
All move to Bay A!
Come on, people, move!

13:29.451 --> 13:31.618
- Come on, please!
- Sir, I need you to move, please.

13:31.620 --> 13:32.996
Get her away from here, okay?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.622
Thank you. Thank you. I need lights!

13:35.624 --> 13:36.625
Sarah!

13:52.141 --> 13:55.019
This kid named Josh
threw red paint all over.

13:55.227 --> 13:56.643
Mrs. Smith was mad.

13:56.645 --> 13:58.689
Josh's mom had to come pick him up.

14:04.236 --> 14:06.363
- You like your teacher?
- She's nice.

14:07.698 --> 14:08.699
Good.

14:09.867 --> 14:10.868
Dad?

14:11.702 --> 14:12.703
Yes?

14:12.828 --> 14:14.663
How come we don't go to church?

14:20.878 --> 14:21.879
I don't know.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.673
Uncle David and his family
go to church.

14:26.383 --> 14:27.718
They go to a synagogue.

14:28.385 --> 14:29.511
What's that?

14:30.679 --> 14:32.181
Well, it's similar.

14:33.474 --> 14:34.975
Can we can go to a synagogue?

14:36.685 --> 14:37.686
No, we're...

14:41.690 --> 14:42.691
Well, we're not Jewish.

14:45.861 --> 14:48.364
Did you and Mommy
get married in a church?

14:48.697 --> 14:49.698
Yeah.

14:50.366 --> 14:52.743
The one we used to go to
when Mommy was alive.

14:54.703 --> 14:55.746
That's the one.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.206
I liked it there.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.293
You remember it?

15:01.710 --> 15:02.711
At the church?

15:02.753 --> 15:04.880
A little. I was small.

15:07.508 --> 15:08.509
Yeah.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.720
That was two years ago.

15:17.976 --> 15:21.188
<i>I miss Mommy.
She made good food.</i>

15:21.980 --> 15:23.732
<i>Yeah, me, too.</i>

15:24.775 --> 15:25.776
<i>Eat your dinner.</i>

15:26.527 --> 15:28.195
- <i>Dad?</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

15:28.529 --> 15:31.365
<i>Sometimes I can't remember
what Mommy looked like.</i>

15:49.675 --> 15:50.676
Tiff.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.761
Tiff?

15:53.929 --> 15:54.930
Dad.

16:01.937 --> 16:03.105
You made bail, Tom.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.448
- What's he doing here?
- He's the one that bailed you out.

16:12.948 --> 16:13.949
Where is David?

16:14.408 --> 16:15.993
You guys got
another call this morning.

16:16.118 --> 16:17.786
I guess it's been
a busy weekend for you.

16:18.037 --> 16:19.288
Can I give you a lift?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.790
My friend will be here
as soon as the fire is out.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.375
Well, that could be hours,

16:24.501 --> 16:25.669
and I'm here now.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.421
Just a ride.

16:30.799 --> 16:31.800
Okay.

16:33.177 --> 16:34.178
Thanks.

16:50.235 --> 16:51.320
I'm sorry.

16:52.821 --> 16:54.073
Apology accepted.

16:54.531 --> 16:55.532
Dan Underwood.

16:56.825 --> 16:57.826
Tom Hatcher.

17:07.419 --> 17:08.712
Listen, Tom...

17:08.837 --> 17:10.339
Is it okay if I call you Tom?

17:13.842 --> 17:15.886
Despite our encounter today,

17:17.346 --> 17:18.347
I'm here

17:19.180 --> 17:20.765
if you need someone to talk to.

17:21.850 --> 17:24.895
In case you need to vent
in a nonviolent way.

17:27.189 --> 17:28.857
I'm not looking for a new friend.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.444
Maybe I am.

17:36.031 --> 17:37.324
Thank you for the lift,

17:38.033 --> 17:39.326
and for bailing me out.

18:13.902 --> 18:14.903
Psst.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.616
Daddy!

18:21.368 --> 18:22.369
Good morning.

18:22.494 --> 18:23.746
You were snoring.

18:24.079 --> 18:25.456
Loud.

18:26.081 --> 18:27.082
How are you feeling?

18:27.499 --> 18:28.792
I want to go home.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.794
I know. I want that, too.

18:31.462 --> 18:33.797
We have to wait and see
what Dr. Robinson says.

18:34.173 --> 18:35.924
He never says yes.

18:41.972 --> 18:44.349
Well, you know,
it hasn't reduced in size,

18:44.475 --> 18:46.310
but, you know, it hasn't grown either.

18:47.186 --> 18:49.938
Is that good? Bad? Or what?

18:50.939 --> 18:54.610
It's good, but normally,
I like to see a reduction in mass.

18:54.735 --> 18:56.945
You know, however,
it does give us some hope.

18:58.322 --> 18:59.406
So, how are you doing?

19:01.867 --> 19:02.868
I'm tired.

19:04.787 --> 19:05.954
Physically.

19:07.164 --> 19:08.165
Mentally.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.896
Northville fighters, let's move!

20:51.477 --> 20:52.478
Excuse me.

20:52.728 --> 20:53.729
My daughter?

20:53.854 --> 20:55.981
They took her for her treatment.
Room 22-C.

20:56.315 --> 20:57.316
Thanks.

21:03.405 --> 21:05.866
It'll be over
before you know it.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.077
Can you be a brave girl for me?

21:08.702 --> 21:09.703
Okay.

21:10.537 --> 21:13.749
Perfect. I'll be back to check on you
in about 30 minutes.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.960
Hey, bug, how you doing?

21:17.252 --> 21:19.338
I want to go home, Daddy.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.465
I know, I know.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.841
Soon, okay?

21:24.676 --> 21:26.637
Hey, what kind of colors you got here?

21:26.970 --> 21:28.097
Can I help you color?

21:48.701 --> 21:49.702
Tiffany?

21:50.869 --> 21:53.330
Tiffany, honey, come be with Mama.

21:54.164 --> 21:56.166
Come on, honey, you'll love it here.

21:57.793 --> 22:00.129
Come on, I'll give you a giant hug.

22:01.964 --> 22:02.965
Come on, honey.

22:04.717 --> 22:06.760
I love you so much!

22:07.052 --> 22:08.137
Sarah, no!

22:19.148 --> 22:20.149
Hold, please!

22:25.988 --> 22:27.781
- What floor?
- Uh, three.

22:52.181 --> 22:54.391
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

22:58.187 --> 22:59.188
Hey, bug.

23:04.193 --> 23:05.361
What did I do now?

23:05.819 --> 23:07.404
How come you didn't sleep over?

23:08.197 --> 23:11.408
I had to go home and shower
and change my clothes.

23:12.201 --> 23:14.578
You don't want everyone to think
your dad stinks, do you?

23:14.661 --> 23:15.996
I don't care.

23:16.747 --> 23:18.205
I can leave if you want.

23:18.207 --> 23:19.416
No, stay.

23:23.212 --> 23:24.463
Did the doctor come in and see you?

23:24.588 --> 23:25.798
Just a nurse.

23:26.548 --> 23:28.217
Was it the mean one or the nice one?

23:28.592 --> 23:29.760
Dad.

23:30.052 --> 23:33.138
Because if it was the mean one,
I'll knock her to the moon.

23:38.477 --> 23:39.770
How are we feeling today?

23:40.062 --> 23:41.271
I want to go home.

23:41.397 --> 23:44.316
Well, as a matter of fact,
that is exactly why I'm here.

23:45.234 --> 23:46.819
- You mean...
- Friday.

23:47.236 --> 23:49.236
- Yay!
- But she'll have to remain

23:49.238 --> 23:50.989
an outpatient for treatments,

23:51.073 --> 23:53.158
but, uh, no more radiation.

23:53.242 --> 23:54.535
That's good news.

23:54.660 --> 23:55.703
Will my hair grow back?

23:56.704 --> 23:58.497
- You'll have curls in no time.
- Yay!

23:58.622 --> 23:59.623
All right,
but I'll tell you something,

23:59.707 --> 24:01.542
you can't go back to school
right away.

24:02.251 --> 24:04.795
You know, her immune system
is still pretty fragile,

24:04.878 --> 24:07.256
and she needs to stay healthy
while she's in treatment.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.800
But I see no reason to keep her here.

24:10.259 --> 24:12.010
Besides, there's nothing
like familiar surroundings

24:12.094 --> 24:13.303
to promote healing.

24:14.304 --> 24:16.265
You'll be back in school
before you know it.

24:16.348 --> 24:17.349
Yay.

24:17.474 --> 24:19.852
So, that's it for me.
If you have any questions, just ask.

24:19.935 --> 24:20.936
Okay.

24:21.145 --> 24:22.479
- Thank you, Dr. Robinson.
- All right. You're welcome.

24:22.563 --> 24:23.689
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

24:24.857 --> 24:26.275
Good news, huh?

24:28.277 --> 24:30.070
In the meantime, you, little girl,

24:30.154 --> 24:31.905
- need to take a nap.
- Okay.

24:32.031 --> 24:33.032
Good.

24:33.282 --> 24:34.283
There you go.

24:39.246 --> 24:40.247
Hi.

24:40.581 --> 24:41.582
What are you reading?

24:42.082 --> 24:44.960
It's a World War II love story.

24:45.294 --> 24:47.171
Silly, I know, but I love the era,

24:47.755 --> 24:50.299
back when men were men
and women allowed them to be.

24:53.302 --> 24:55.095
And you bring your own flowers, too.

24:55.471 --> 24:56.764
I love the smell of them.

24:59.558 --> 25:01.143
Smells like lavender.

25:02.311 --> 25:03.310
Lavender?

25:03.312 --> 25:05.314
Yeah, mountain fresh fabric softener.

25:05.522 --> 25:06.523
I think.

25:07.983 --> 25:11.111
So, instead of fabric softener
reminding you of nature,

25:11.320 --> 25:13.322
nature reminds you of laundry.

25:14.323 --> 25:15.532
Yeah, I guess.

25:17.701 --> 25:19.328
I'm Tom, Tom Hatcher.

25:20.329 --> 25:21.330
You a cop, Tom?

25:21.497 --> 25:23.582
Even when you guys are out of uniform,
I can always tell.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.209
Well, you're way off.

25:25.501 --> 25:26.502
Am I?

25:27.336 --> 25:28.379
I'm a fireman.

25:28.504 --> 25:29.505
Ah, yes.

25:29.588 --> 25:30.589
Way off.

25:32.424 --> 25:34.093
I'm Melissa, Melissa Nolan.

25:38.013 --> 25:39.014
Do you mind?

25:39.139 --> 25:40.349
I'm sorry.

25:41.183 --> 25:42.726
No, I'd like to sit down.

25:42.810 --> 25:43.977
Oh, yeah. Duh.

25:47.606 --> 25:48.732
You work here, then?

25:49.108 --> 25:51.360
No. No, I like pretending.

25:51.944 --> 25:54.363
On Tuesdays, I'm an astronaut.

25:57.616 --> 25:59.993
I don't know
if I could work here every day.

26:00.786 --> 26:02.454
- Place makes me feel...
- Sick?

26:04.373 --> 26:05.374
Isolated.

26:07.251 --> 26:08.252
I'm sorry.

26:08.752 --> 26:11.588
It's been a long time
since I've tried something like this.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.006
This?

26:13.257 --> 26:15.008
And for what... I don't even know...

26:15.592 --> 26:17.845
For what it's worth,
you seem like a really nice person.

26:17.970 --> 26:18.971
I've got to go.

26:26.395 --> 26:28.856
Now, you all know,
my brother-in-law passed.

26:30.149 --> 26:31.400
I told my sister,

26:31.650 --> 26:33.068
I said, "You're family.

26:33.777 --> 26:35.863
"You're coming here,
ain't no two ways about that."

26:35.988 --> 26:36.989
Right.

26:37.239 --> 26:39.658
It's the Christian thing to do,
and I'd do it again.

26:40.659 --> 26:42.494
But y'all have been to my house, man.

26:42.870 --> 26:45.914
You know, I got three bedrooms,
if you count that little one,

26:46.040 --> 26:47.416
and it's seven people living there.

26:47.499 --> 26:49.084
Where did we put those donuts?

26:49.668 --> 26:51.295
Now, last week I came home,

26:52.087 --> 26:54.006
after sitting here for three days.

26:54.423 --> 26:55.632
Three days, man!

26:56.425 --> 26:57.426
All I want

26:58.052 --> 26:59.303
is something nice to eat,

26:59.720 --> 27:03.015
remote control,
a little peace and quiet.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.725
What do you think I had for dinner?

27:05.059 --> 27:06.433
I think you had all the donuts,

27:06.435 --> 27:08.479
'cause there were two dozen
when I came in this morning.

27:08.604 --> 27:10.439
Bowl of cereal. Hmm?

27:11.732 --> 27:14.443
Now, Carla made that roast.
Man, you know I like that roast.

27:16.403 --> 27:19.698
Potatoes, carrots, onions,
the whole nine.

27:20.699 --> 27:22.451
I open up the slow cooker
when I get home,

27:22.826 --> 27:24.745
and those boys,
them picked it dry, man!

27:25.204 --> 27:26.455
Now, I love those boys,

27:26.538 --> 27:29.541
but we are gonna have to have
a serious conversation

27:29.666 --> 27:31.919
about who the alpha member
of this family is.

27:32.044 --> 27:35.297
Because a man can't work all week
and come home to a bowl of cereal!

27:35.422 --> 27:36.423
It just ain't right!

27:37.091 --> 27:39.468
Man, it's like a sitcom over there
or something.

27:40.469 --> 27:42.638
I ought to pitch that
to a network television.

27:43.055 --> 27:44.765
Yeah, and you should let me play you.

27:45.766 --> 27:47.474
And why should you play me?

27:47.476 --> 27:48.727
'Cause I'm handsome.

27:48.894 --> 27:50.145
Here we go, boys!

28:06.995 --> 28:08.080
Mind if I join you?

28:09.164 --> 28:10.499
Only if you promise to stay.

28:11.792 --> 28:14.253
So, I got tired
of filing insurance claims

28:14.336 --> 28:15.504
and went back to school.

28:15.921 --> 28:18.465
At least with nursing
I know I'm making a difference.

28:18.507 --> 28:19.675
That's what it's all about.

28:20.759 --> 28:21.760
What about you?

28:24.596 --> 28:26.306
I'd rather hear more about you.

28:26.390 --> 28:28.392
Come on. You have a great job.

28:28.517 --> 28:30.517
I mean, who doesn't
want to be a fireman?

28:30.519 --> 28:31.520
Later, okay?

28:32.146 --> 28:34.273
Sometimes, it's nice just to listen.

28:37.693 --> 28:38.986
Okay, well, um,

28:39.611 --> 28:41.030
I'm from Grand Rapids.

28:41.530 --> 28:44.950
My father was an economics professor
at Grand Valley,

28:45.034 --> 28:47.745
and my mother was an artist.

28:48.203 --> 28:49.913
Oh, like a painter?

28:50.414 --> 28:51.538
No, folk art.

28:51.540 --> 28:56.295
Like, Grandma Moses type stuff,
wooden trinkets and quilts.

28:57.212 --> 29:00.215
To be honest, we didn't really
get along once I got older.

29:01.425 --> 29:03.552
Sounds like my relationship
with my father.

29:04.011 --> 29:05.554
She was a good mother.

29:06.013 --> 29:08.766
Just didn't really have
a lot in common with her.

29:09.141 --> 29:10.976
I mean, I guess nobody does, but...

29:14.355 --> 29:15.564
I met a girl once.

29:16.023 --> 29:17.566
I had a lot in common with her.

29:20.819 --> 29:22.154
It must be really tough.

29:25.532 --> 29:27.576
Not a day goes by
I don't think of her.

29:27.701 --> 29:30.454
And on the rare occasion that I do...

29:33.040 --> 29:34.208
I feel guilty.

29:35.793 --> 29:37.211
How long ago did she...

29:38.253 --> 29:39.254
Two years.

29:41.215 --> 29:42.216
Wow.

29:43.592 --> 29:45.177
It's been two years already.

29:54.019 --> 29:56.563
Oh, um, your daughter's been sent
to out processing.

29:56.605 --> 29:58.649
She should be ready in about an hour.

29:58.774 --> 30:00.109
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

30:18.335 --> 30:19.628
What's on your mind, bug?

30:19.920 --> 30:23.090
- I bet the baby ducks are big.
- I bet they are.

30:23.465 --> 30:24.633
Can we go see them?

30:24.675 --> 30:27.261
No, honey, you're supposed
to stay inside, remember?

30:27.344 --> 30:28.635
But, Dad...

30:28.637 --> 30:29.805
Thems are the rules.

30:32.641 --> 30:34.643
How about we play a game?

30:34.852 --> 30:37.271
No, I don't want to play a game.

30:38.272 --> 30:39.898
How about we build a fort?

30:40.149 --> 30:42.818
- Can we build it in the living room?
- Of course we can.

30:43.152 --> 30:45.070
I'll go get some sheets and blankets.

30:45.654 --> 30:46.697
I'm coming, too.

30:50.451 --> 30:51.660
Can I have a bite of yours?

30:53.662 --> 30:55.664
You got the wrong one.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.669
Nuh-uh. Mine is way better.

31:01.295 --> 31:02.296
Let me see.

31:07.676 --> 31:10.262
Are you kidding? Mine's way better.

31:17.853 --> 31:20.689
- Where'd you get that?
- Your room. It's Mommy's.

31:21.148 --> 31:22.149
Yeah, I know.

31:23.067 --> 31:24.151
Did she read it?

31:24.693 --> 31:26.111
Mommy read a lot of books.

31:26.862 --> 31:28.072
Can we read it?

31:29.114 --> 31:30.699
Well, it's a bunch
of different stories, honey.

31:30.824 --> 31:32.117
It's not just one.

31:32.201 --> 31:33.494
Can we read them all?

31:33.994 --> 31:34.995
Pick one.

31:37.122 --> 31:38.123
That one.

31:38.665 --> 31:39.666
Which one?

31:39.708 --> 31:40.751
Where my finger is.

31:41.335 --> 31:43.921
- "How Sam Hart Beat the Devil"?
- Yeah.

31:44.713 --> 31:45.881
You got it, kid.

31:51.595 --> 31:54.014
"While taking in the air
on his doorstep

31:54.139 --> 31:55.599
"on a summer evening,

31:56.183 --> 32:00.020
"he was visited
by a bland and dignified stranger."

32:07.861 --> 32:08.862
Daddy?

32:10.030 --> 32:11.031
Yes?

32:11.156 --> 32:13.200
Why was Sam Hart afraid?

32:14.660 --> 32:16.203
Why do you think he was afraid?

32:16.537 --> 32:19.123
Because he was scared
he'd lose his horse.

32:19.915 --> 32:21.333
It was a nice horse.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.460
Can I have a horse?

32:24.461 --> 32:26.547
Hmm, we'll see.

32:26.755 --> 32:27.756
Okay?

32:46.400 --> 32:47.484
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:47.609 --> 32:49.778
- Don't you look pretty.
- Thank you.

32:49.903 --> 32:52.031
Good morning. Welcome.

32:52.823 --> 32:54.575
Daddy, look.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.202
Let's sit here. They saved us a spot.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.917
It's good to be
in the house of the Lord.

33:04.043 --> 33:05.294
Amen.

33:07.046 --> 33:08.255
Good morning, friends.

33:09.048 --> 33:11.633
Won't you please join Lisa for a song?

33:13.052 --> 33:16.180
<i>♪ O Lord, my God</i>

33:16.430 --> 33:19.016
<i>♪ When I in awesome wonder... ♪</i>

33:19.141 --> 33:21.143
That's the guy who punched the pastor.

33:22.186 --> 33:23.437
Back row, center.

33:24.813 --> 33:26.523
Okay, but let's be discreet.

33:28.817 --> 33:31.820
<i>♪ I see the stars</i>

33:38.660 --> 33:39.953

33:50.297 --> 33:51.298
Yes?

33:51.673 --> 33:53.884
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

33:54.551 --> 33:55.719
You're kidding, right?

33:57.471 --> 33:58.472
You're serious?

34:01.517 --> 34:03.477
Hey, hey, where do you think
you're going?

34:03.560 --> 34:04.728
To get my daughter.

34:08.482 --> 34:10.067
- Tiff, we have to go.
- What? Why?

34:10.192 --> 34:11.192
Come on, let's go.

34:11.860 --> 34:13.112
It just started!

34:13.237 --> 34:15.322
<i>♪ How great Thou art ♪</i>

34:16.739 --> 34:18.200
This man says we have to leave.

34:18.325 --> 34:19.868
Why? It's not fair.

34:20.243 --> 34:21.245
No, it's not.

34:21.870 --> 34:23.538
- I'm sorry.
- Too late.

34:29.210 --> 34:30.212
It's okay, bug.

34:30.796 --> 34:32.547
We'll go to a different church, okay?

34:33.214 --> 34:35.551
No, I don't want
to go to a different church.

34:35.676 --> 34:38.095
I want to go to the one
where you and Mommy got married.

34:38.679 --> 34:41.390
- We can't.
- Why? Because I'm sick?

34:41.598 --> 34:42.766
No. No.

34:43.016 --> 34:45.768
It has nothing to do with you.
It's not your fault.

34:45.893 --> 34:46.937
Then why?

34:50.899 --> 34:53.360
We'll find a different church.
I promise.

35:06.081 --> 35:07.624
Don't get too carried away.

35:16.550 --> 35:17.551
Hello.

35:17.634 --> 35:18.927
Hello yourself.

35:19.928 --> 35:20.929
<i>Hi.</i>

35:23.807 --> 35:26.852
I hope you don't mind.
I got your number from Records.

35:27.728 --> 35:28.937
Isn't that illegal?

35:29.313 --> 35:30.939
Unethical, yes.

35:31.815 --> 35:33.525
Not sure about the legality, though.

35:33.942 --> 35:35.942
<i>I heard that Tiffany
was released today.</i>

35:35.944 --> 35:36.987
<i>That's great news.</i>

35:38.739 --> 35:40.282
She's still an outpatient, though.

35:45.162 --> 35:46.663
<i>Maybe we could do lunch?</i>

35:47.206 --> 35:48.415
Uh...

35:49.958 --> 35:51.126
I'd like that.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.295
Do you want my number?

35:54.171 --> 35:55.214
Caller ID.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.343
Duh. Um...

36:01.387 --> 36:03.138
Well, I'm going to get back to work,

36:03.639 --> 36:05.974
and I was just calling to say hi.

36:07.142 --> 36:08.143
Bye.

36:09.103 --> 36:10.187
Bye.

36:12.773 --> 36:13.899
Was that the fireman?

36:14.149 --> 36:15.984
Not that it's any of your business,

36:16.985 --> 36:18.237
but, yes.

36:20.239 --> 36:21.240
Okay.

36:26.995 --> 36:28.497
Anybody seen Tom today?

36:28.831 --> 36:31.041
It's a drill day, Chief.
Cut the guy a break.

36:32.584 --> 36:34.002
Get a haircut, David.

36:34.712 --> 36:36.171
I'm not going to tell you again.

36:37.005 --> 36:38.006
Yes, sir.

36:39.717 --> 36:40.926
Steve, how you feeling?

36:41.385 --> 36:42.845
<i>Great.</i>

36:43.137 --> 36:44.263
<i>It's 80 degrees out,</i>

36:44.388 --> 36:46.932
<i>and I'm in full gear
climbing a ladder.</i>

36:47.599 --> 36:49.935
<i>I didn't want to go to the beach
or the pool or anything today.</i>

36:50.019 --> 36:51.186
<i>I wanted to be hauling</i>

36:51.270 --> 36:53.939
<i>a hundred pounds of gear
up this ladder. Thanks.</i>

36:54.273 --> 36:58.027
Yeah, maybe firefighting
is not the job for you.

36:59.028 --> 37:01.572
<i>Aw, come on now, Chief.
You know I'm your favorite.</i>

37:03.032 --> 37:04.241
Rodriguez, you're up!

37:07.161 --> 37:08.704
Get up that ladder! Move!

37:14.043 --> 37:15.753
- Hello.
- Hey.

37:17.463 --> 37:20.507
What happened to,
"I'll call you when I'm down there"?

37:21.050 --> 37:22.217
I forgot.

37:23.260 --> 37:25.429
You know, with everything going on
with Tiffany, I just...

37:25.512 --> 37:27.389
It was just lunch, Tom.

37:28.057 --> 37:29.516
It's okay. Really.

37:30.059 --> 37:32.061
- I feel really bad.
- Don't.

37:33.187 --> 37:35.064
How about we do dinner instead?

37:36.607 --> 37:38.776
Tomorrow, around 7:00?

37:38.901 --> 37:41.737
Well, it's the least you could do.

37:41.862 --> 37:42.863
Great.

37:43.072 --> 37:44.656
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

37:46.075 --> 37:47.493
- Hello.
- Hi.

37:47.743 --> 37:48.911
Hey, bug.

37:49.286 --> 37:50.537
She did great.

37:50.662 --> 37:52.081
I knew she would.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.418
Who was that lady?

37:57.086 --> 37:58.087
Just a nurse.

37:58.253 --> 37:59.505
She's pretty.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.006
You should marry her.

38:01.548 --> 38:02.633
"Marry her"?

38:03.467 --> 38:05.094
Bug, where did you get that idea?

38:05.344 --> 38:06.845
Mommy told me.

39:07.489 --> 39:10.159
I saw the light on,
so I thought maybe I could...

39:12.161 --> 39:13.162
How are you?

39:14.038 --> 39:15.039
Fine.

39:16.206 --> 39:17.207
May I come in?

39:18.834 --> 39:19.835
Sure.

39:26.008 --> 39:27.009
Thank you.

39:27.176 --> 39:28.177
Can I get you a beer?

39:28.969 --> 39:29.970
Soda?

39:30.387 --> 39:31.388
Okay.

39:35.059 --> 39:37.019
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

39:39.355 --> 39:43.359
So, I understand you stopped
by the church on Sunday.

39:44.651 --> 39:45.652
Yeah.

39:45.778 --> 39:47.946
Just a personal observation.

39:48.030 --> 39:50.032
You have a lot of work
to do with hospitality.

39:50.115 --> 39:51.408
Yeah, that was wrong.

39:52.201 --> 39:55.204
And I apologize. That's all my fault.

39:58.207 --> 39:59.249
Daddy?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.210
Come on in, bug.

40:03.212 --> 40:04.755
Hey, how are you doing?

40:05.631 --> 40:06.840
Hi.

40:07.091 --> 40:08.092
Who's that?

40:08.217 --> 40:10.219
He's the pastor at the church.

40:11.095 --> 40:13.222
- Can I show him Froggy?
- Yeah, go ahead.

40:13.764 --> 40:16.308
His name is Froggy,
and he likes to lick people.

40:18.686 --> 40:20.562
That's very cute. What is your name?

40:21.980 --> 40:22.981
You can tell him.

40:23.232 --> 40:24.233
Tiffany.

40:25.150 --> 40:27.027
Tiffany. That's a beautiful name.

40:27.778 --> 40:29.238
And how old are you, Tiffany?

40:29.780 --> 40:30.781
You can tell him.

40:31.323 --> 40:32.574
Seven.

40:32.658 --> 40:33.909
Seven, wow.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.245
Hey, you want some chocolate milk?

40:36.286 --> 40:37.287
Really?

40:37.413 --> 40:38.706
Just a small cup.

40:43.419 --> 40:44.670
She's a cute kid.

40:45.546 --> 40:48.006
Yeah, well, she has cancer.

40:49.258 --> 40:52.261
And your thugs
kicked her out of your church,

40:52.553 --> 40:54.471
and she cried all day on Sunday.

40:54.555 --> 40:57.266
- And I...
- Just a small cup, Tiffany.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.853
- Look, I'm really sorry...
- Dan,

41:01.645 --> 41:04.106
I appreciate you stopping by,

41:04.857 --> 41:06.233
but I'm not coming back.

41:16.869 --> 41:20.539
Tom, I'd like a second chance.
Try to make things right.

41:21.290 --> 41:22.291
We all do.

41:23.167 --> 41:25.294
- Life is nothing but...
- Good night, Dan.

41:25.919 --> 41:27.296
...second chances.

41:31.467 --> 41:32.468
God help him.

41:35.304 --> 41:36.305
Help me.

41:36.597 --> 41:40.684
I see you boys wondering,
"What does old Steve have?"

41:40.768 --> 41:42.309
Well, he might have a pair of twos,

41:42.311 --> 41:44.855
but then again,
you never know with old Steve.

41:44.938 --> 41:48.150
Tom, your mother-in-law
just called from the hospital.

41:48.275 --> 41:49.902
She had to take Tiffany back there.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.362
Don't worry about your shift.

41:52.154 --> 41:53.280
Get on over there.

41:53.322 --> 41:55.407
- God bless you, buddy.
- Don't worry about us.

41:55.532 --> 41:56.784
We've got your back, bro.

41:56.909 --> 41:58.369
- We got you, man.
- We're here for you, buddy.

41:58.494 --> 41:59.495
See you, Tom.

42:01.955 --> 42:03.332
All right, well, I guess I'll get...

42:03.374 --> 42:05.000
Get out of here, too, then.

42:05.125 --> 42:07.086
No. You're not going anywhere.

42:07.336 --> 42:10.547
In fact, I need you on bathroom duty.

42:11.298 --> 42:12.299
Now.

42:15.010 --> 42:17.930
Looks like old Steve
has a royal flush!

42:21.350 --> 42:23.102
Clean that toilet nice, Steve.

42:23.936 --> 42:25.354
I'll be in there in a minute.

42:32.903 --> 42:33.904
Mr. Hatcher.

42:34.363 --> 42:38.659
Look, I'm sorry about the wait.
This is merely precautionary.

42:38.784 --> 42:39.993
Can we get you anything?

42:40.369 --> 42:42.413
No thanks. Any ideas?

42:42.579 --> 42:43.580
Uh, not yet.

42:43.664 --> 42:45.374
Her CT scans get back this afternoon,

42:45.416 --> 42:47.626
so in the meantime,
I'm just going to let her rest,

42:48.627 --> 42:49.837
and let you rest.

42:51.130 --> 42:53.549
Don't worry, we're going
to take good care of her.

42:53.841 --> 42:54.842
Thanks.

42:57.636 --> 43:01.390
This has to be the worst coffee
in the history of fire departments.

43:02.850 --> 43:04.018
How's Tiff doing?

43:05.227 --> 43:06.395
Hospital again.

43:06.770 --> 43:08.188
Anything I can do?

43:09.023 --> 43:10.441
Unless you got a cure for cancer.

43:10.566 --> 43:12.192
I wish I did.

43:12.985 --> 43:14.278
I really do.

43:14.987 --> 43:17.990
You know, we all love you, Tom.
Really, we do.

43:18.949 --> 43:21.243
But City Hall
is getting kind of antsy about

43:21.368 --> 43:23.829
when they're gonna start getting
return on their investment,

43:23.912 --> 43:25.873
you know, bang for the buck.

43:25.998 --> 43:27.416
You're kidding, right?

43:27.708 --> 43:29.418
You've had a rough patch.

43:30.794 --> 43:33.630
But City Hall, they really don't care.

43:34.798 --> 43:37.424
And I just wanted to give you
a heads up,

43:37.426 --> 43:40.262
so you're not caught
with your pants down.

43:40.929 --> 43:43.432
I have vacation and personal days.

43:43.515 --> 43:44.892
You used them all up.

43:45.017 --> 43:48.854
Chief, I got vacation time.
He can have it.

43:48.937 --> 43:52.439
And if that doesn't cover it,
I'll take his hours.

43:52.441 --> 43:55.444
I'll work,
you put Tom's name in the books.

43:56.612 --> 43:59.948
I got personal days.
You can have them, Tom.

44:00.074 --> 44:02.910
Me, too, Chief.
I have time, you can use mine.

44:03.744 --> 44:05.454
Thanks.

44:06.038 --> 44:07.623
Thanks, guys.

44:14.880 --> 44:18.092
Steve, garbage.

44:24.473 --> 44:26.475
May I get you something to drink?

44:26.517 --> 44:28.560
An ice tea would be wonderful.

44:29.061 --> 44:31.063
- Very good.
- Thank you.

44:43.117 --> 44:45.494
Well, we could keep heading north

44:45.536 --> 44:48.372
- and end up in Chicago two days early.
- Mm-hmm.

44:48.497 --> 44:53.335
Or we could take a left
and spend a few days in Memphis.

44:53.460 --> 44:54.503
What's in Memphis?

44:54.586 --> 44:59.007
Nothing but the home
of the king of rock 'n' roll, baby.

44:59.133 --> 45:02.511
Elvis, you hunk,
a hunk of burnin' love.

45:02.803 --> 45:05.013
I'm all shook up, baby.

45:05.514 --> 45:07.182
- Let's go.
- Really?

45:07.307 --> 45:09.476
Yeah. Let's do it.

45:09.518 --> 45:11.395
Let's do everything. Always.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.148
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too, king.

45:19.611 --> 45:21.528
Can I get you another one, hon?

45:21.530 --> 45:22.614
Yeah.

45:32.624 --> 45:35.961
- Another ice tea?
- Um...

45:37.588 --> 45:40.382
- Just the check, please.
- Of course.

45:44.553 --> 45:48.223
What is the shortest verse
in the Bible?

45:50.184 --> 45:51.558
"And Jesus wept."

45:51.560 --> 45:52.811
So, what does that...

45:52.936 --> 45:53.937
What does that tell us?

45:54.021 --> 45:55.647
Sorry, one second.

45:55.773 --> 45:57.191
I have to take this. Hello.

45:59.735 --> 46:00.736
Yeah.

46:02.446 --> 46:05.324
Yes. I could do that, definitely.

46:07.076 --> 46:09.244
Okay, I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

46:10.871 --> 46:12.581
Okay.

46:14.083 --> 46:15.751
Sorry, duty calls.

46:15.834 --> 46:18.295
Um, would you mind leading
the rest of the Bible study?

46:18.420 --> 46:19.546
- Not a problem, absolutely.
- Thank you.

46:19.588 --> 46:20.587
- Everything okay?
- Yup,

46:20.589 --> 46:22.591
- I just have to take off right now.
- Okay.

46:22.758 --> 46:25.594
- Um, thank you all, see you next week.
- Be careful, please.

46:32.601 --> 46:33.977
Rough week?

46:34.603 --> 46:38.607
Well, aren't you a big hunk of a man?
Can I get you something?

46:39.566 --> 46:40.818
Nothing. Thanks, I'm fine.

46:41.068 --> 46:43.070
- How about you?
- He's done.

46:44.613 --> 46:45.614
I'm all set.

46:47.658 --> 46:48.659
Okay.

46:50.285 --> 46:53.622
I know this isn't exactly
your job description.

46:54.623 --> 46:56.667
No, it's right up my alley.

47:00.671 --> 47:01.922
Excuse me.

47:27.114 --> 47:28.615
You're gonna be sick?

47:29.658 --> 47:31.035
I'm fine.

47:32.286 --> 47:35.247
Just in case, take this bag.

47:36.623 --> 47:37.708
Thanks.

47:52.681 --> 47:54.683
I'm not a bad person, you know.

47:55.142 --> 47:56.685
I know that.

47:57.686 --> 47:59.646
Then tell me,
why do I feel so bad?

48:04.360 --> 48:05.986
Life goes on, Tom.

48:07.696 --> 48:09.281
Is that what God says?

48:10.366 --> 48:13.700
Actually, it's Lennon and McCartney.

48:13.702 --> 48:15.954
Or Robert Frost. Take your choice.

48:19.833 --> 48:21.210
Your wife,

48:22.503 --> 48:23.670
what was her name?

48:24.671 --> 48:25.714
Sarah.

48:27.549 --> 48:30.719
And she was beautiful, inside and out.

48:33.722 --> 48:35.557
It won't always be this way.

48:37.685 --> 48:38.894
You don't understand.

48:41.730 --> 48:43.023
No one really does.

48:45.776 --> 48:50.906
Tom, let me help you.

48:51.865 --> 48:54.952
You could have called anyone
to come pick you up,

48:55.077 --> 48:57.871
anybody from the firehouse,
but you called me.

48:59.415 --> 49:01.333
- Talk to me.
- You can't help.

49:02.376 --> 49:03.752
I'm not God.

49:04.753 --> 49:08.590
I don't even claim
to be a good person, but I try.

49:09.758 --> 49:12.386
Let me try and help you.

49:16.932 --> 49:18.767
Thanks for the ride, Dan.

49:33.782 --> 49:35.909
<i>Hey, Tom, it's Melissa.</i>

49:36.952 --> 49:40.247
<i>If you're on your way
to the restaurant, just forget it.</i>

49:40.664 --> 49:41.665
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

49:43.208 --> 49:44.960
<i>I'm not mad. I just...</i>

49:46.712 --> 49:48.797
<i>I just hope everything's okay.</i>

49:50.466 --> 49:51.800
<i>Goodbye.</i>

51:28.480 --> 51:29.898
Hi, Dan.

51:29.940 --> 51:31.900
Thought you could use a good cup.

51:32.317 --> 51:33.694
Thanks.

51:37.072 --> 51:38.782
It's a little early, isn't it?

51:38.907 --> 51:40.325
It's a beautiful morning.

51:42.036 --> 51:43.787
Need a ride to your car?

51:43.912 --> 51:46.915
Oh. Yeah. I forgot about that.

51:48.333 --> 51:50.961
- All right. Thanks.
- Sure.

52:02.806 --> 52:04.933
I just need to take care
of some things real quick.

52:04.975 --> 52:06.393
Come on.

52:33.170 --> 52:34.838
Big fan of spinach?

52:35.798 --> 52:36.965
I hate it.

52:41.804 --> 52:45.974
The spinach reminds me,
"I yam what I yam."

52:46.975 --> 52:48.352
And this sculpture,

52:48.435 --> 52:52.981
the sculpture reminds me that God
is the redeemer of broken things.

52:53.774 --> 52:56.318
In him, all things are made new.

52:59.988 --> 53:01.240
It's called "born again."

53:02.199 --> 53:04.326
All right, just one more thing
before we go.

53:05.786 --> 53:06.995
And, Lord,

53:08.831 --> 53:10.999
I just wanna thank you for...

53:14.002 --> 53:16.004
Well, you know.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.133
You're good,

53:19.925 --> 53:23.220
and I need you, every day.

53:24.221 --> 53:26.223
They meet once a week,

53:26.348 --> 53:29.351
praying for each other
and over requests for prayers.

53:29.435 --> 53:30.436
Amen.

53:35.149 --> 53:37.192
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

53:37.401 --> 53:39.028
Thank you for being faithful.

53:41.447 --> 53:45.075
God has been working
on my heart lately,

53:45.200 --> 53:46.493
like he often does.

53:47.036 --> 53:50.706
God wants to be
an active part of our life,

53:51.582 --> 53:54.626
but he doesn't force himself upon us.

53:55.711 --> 54:00.883
The Bible says that Jesus
stands at the door and knocks.

54:02.051 --> 54:06.847
He's waiting for us to open the door
and invite him in.

54:09.058 --> 54:10.476
We are weak.

54:11.226 --> 54:13.062
He is strong.

54:13.854 --> 54:19.318
When we let him in,
we allow ourselves to depend on him.

54:21.403 --> 54:26.075
His power is made perfect
in our weakness.

54:32.664 --> 54:34.458
What do you want from me?

54:46.637 --> 54:48.639
My wife died two years ago.

54:50.349 --> 54:51.892
It was sudden.

54:54.103 --> 54:56.105
We barely had time to say goodbye.

54:58.774 --> 55:00.693
Everything happened so quickly.

55:01.985 --> 55:05.114
One minute we were in college,
then married with a kid.

55:07.991 --> 55:10.327
It was my idea to become a fireman.

55:12.788 --> 55:14.873
I was away three or four days a week.

55:17.543 --> 55:20.129
She would have gotten cancer
either way, Tom.

55:21.547 --> 55:23.757
It makes no difference
where you worked.

55:25.217 --> 55:26.677
I don't know.

55:27.511 --> 55:28.929
With the baby

55:29.722 --> 55:32.391
and getting the house together
and me always gone.

55:36.895 --> 55:40.065
Maybe if I had been around more
and we moved slower,

55:41.817 --> 55:43.902
we could have caught it earlier.

55:45.154 --> 55:46.488
It's not your fault.

55:48.157 --> 55:50.492
It's nobody's fault. It's life.

56:04.590 --> 56:08.510
Tiffany has renal cell carcinoma.

56:10.387 --> 56:12.181
It's rare with children,

56:13.640 --> 56:15.184
but there you have it.

56:23.192 --> 56:25.069
Our lives are like flowerbeds.

56:26.570 --> 56:28.113
Most just see the colors,

56:28.197 --> 56:30.199
but when you get in real close,
you realize

56:31.658 --> 56:33.744
we're all just sitting in manure.

56:37.748 --> 56:39.750
I don't know about you, Dan Underwood.

56:55.599 --> 56:57.224
Hi, I was looking for my daughter.

56:57.226 --> 56:59.770
Mr. Hatcher, we've been trying
to get a hold of you.

56:59.853 --> 57:01.313
I don't have any messages.

57:02.106 --> 57:03.899
Did you call
Mr. Hatcher's cell number?

57:04.024 --> 57:05.984
No, I called his house.
I left a message.

57:06.068 --> 57:07.236
That's why you have my cell.

57:07.319 --> 57:11.115
We had to move Tiffany to ICU.
She had a seizure this morning.

57:12.825 --> 57:14.243
Mr. Hatcher?

57:15.452 --> 57:17.037
Mr. Hatcher?

57:17.996 --> 57:20.999
Mr. Hatcher, are you okay?

57:31.468 --> 57:32.553
Feeling better?

57:34.346 --> 57:35.848
What's this?

57:36.473 --> 57:37.474
Tylenol.

57:44.481 --> 57:45.566
Take it easy.

57:47.067 --> 57:48.569
Tiffany is not going anywhere.

57:50.279 --> 57:51.488
How is she?

57:52.072 --> 57:54.283
Well, why don't we make sure
that you're all right first, Tom?

57:56.452 --> 57:59.371
You always call me Mr. Hatcher,
but never Tom.

58:00.164 --> 58:02.291
Would you like me to go back
to calling you Mr. Hatcher?

58:02.708 --> 58:06.295
It's okay. It's not very comforting,
but it's okay.

58:10.257 --> 58:11.341
So, how is she?

58:12.301 --> 58:13.343
Well...

58:16.263 --> 58:17.931
Craig, tell me how my daughter is.

58:18.849 --> 58:21.894
Cancer has moved into her lymph nodes,

58:21.977 --> 58:24.188
and we're gonna have a meeting
to discuss treatment.

58:24.313 --> 58:26.315
- But you said the tumor hadn't grown.
- It hasn't,

58:26.940 --> 58:28.984
but the cancer has spread.

58:30.319 --> 58:31.320
So, what does this mean?

58:33.322 --> 58:34.406
We'll know more soon.

58:39.870 --> 58:41.330
Daddy's here, Tiff.

58:44.166 --> 58:46.543
What do you want me to do?
I'll do anything.

58:48.337 --> 58:51.298
Just tell me. Please.

59:06.313 --> 59:08.148
- Hey.
- What time is it?

59:09.441 --> 59:11.110
You need to get some rest.

59:11.610 --> 59:13.195
I'll be all right.

59:15.322 --> 59:17.241
- Sleeping pills?
- Yeah.

59:17.574 --> 59:19.743
Why don't you just go home,
take a shower,

59:20.369 --> 59:22.204
eat something, take the pills
and get some rest?

59:22.329 --> 59:23.539
We'll take care of her.

59:25.416 --> 59:27.626
Maybe a shower, but no pills.

59:27.751 --> 59:29.378
At least, get something to eat.

59:30.045 --> 59:31.338
Oh, uh...

59:31.588 --> 59:33.841
Hospital has showers here
if you wanna use it,

59:33.966 --> 59:36.383
but I still recommend going home
to get some rest.

59:36.385 --> 59:38.387
Okay. Thanks.

1:00:02.619 --> 1:00:03.704
Hey, baby.

1:00:04.621 --> 1:00:05.914
How you feeling?

1:00:07.207 --> 1:00:09.376
Will you sing me a song?

1:00:10.878 --> 1:00:11.920
Sure.

1:00:12.588 --> 1:00:13.922
Anything special?

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:17.509
One of Grandpa's silly songs.

1:00:19.386 --> 1:00:20.637
Okay, I'll try.

1:00:23.849 --> 1:00:26.226
<i>♪ Up and down</i>

1:00:26.310 --> 1:00:29.104
<i>♪ Monkey on my head</i>

1:00:29.730 --> 1:00:32.733
<i>♪ Swinging on my ears</i>

1:00:33.442 --> 1:00:36.862
<i>♪ His name is Fred ♪</i>

1:00:52.753 --> 1:00:54.213
She was awake.

1:00:54.713 --> 1:00:55.839
She laughed.

1:01:01.136 --> 1:01:02.304
Can we talk?

1:01:14.483 --> 1:01:15.484
Tom...

1:01:24.993 --> 1:01:26.286
How long?

1:01:28.997 --> 1:01:30.290
It's not long.

1:01:34.503 --> 1:01:35.504
I'm sorry.

1:01:53.605 --> 1:01:54.982
Hey, Daddy.

1:01:55.983 --> 1:01:58.110
You okay, bug? You want anything?

1:02:24.803 --> 1:02:26.430
How is she feeling?

1:02:26.555 --> 1:02:27.973
Are they making her comfortable?

1:02:29.516 --> 1:02:31.560
She's a little groggy
because of the meds,

1:02:32.394 --> 1:02:34.605
but they're doing a fine job
at the hospital.

1:02:35.439 --> 1:02:37.232
Did Sarah have her own cookbook?

1:02:38.067 --> 1:02:40.319
If there were any meals
that Tiffany liked,

1:02:40.402 --> 1:02:42.071
I could try to make them for her.

1:02:43.447 --> 1:02:45.199
Thank you, that's very nice of you.

1:02:45.741 --> 1:02:48.035
She made a special mac and cheese.

1:02:48.577 --> 1:02:50.537
I don't really remember
how she made it,

1:02:50.579 --> 1:02:52.456
but I can look around for the recipe.

1:02:56.585 --> 1:02:59.630
So, I've been talking to a pastor.

1:03:00.714 --> 1:03:04.176
Dan Underwood from the church
where Sarah and I used to go.

1:03:06.887 --> 1:03:08.222
He helping you at all?

1:03:09.598 --> 1:03:11.850
He can't help. Doctors can't help.

1:03:15.062 --> 1:03:17.022
What does God want from me, David?

1:03:20.984 --> 1:03:22.194
I don't know.

1:03:23.237 --> 1:03:27.449
My parents really loved your family.
I ever tell you that?

1:03:29.118 --> 1:03:32.621
They always respected
your parents' devotion to their faith.

1:03:33.622 --> 1:03:34.623
You know,

1:03:35.874 --> 1:03:38.627
when my parents died,
there was this...

1:03:39.753 --> 1:03:43.006
This just hole in my heart.

1:03:43.757 --> 1:03:45.342
I couldn't eat.

1:03:46.635 --> 1:03:47.634
I couldn't sleep.

1:03:47.636 --> 1:03:49.763
I'm not talking
about my parents, David!

1:03:50.472 --> 1:03:52.141
Parents are supposed to die!

1:03:52.516 --> 1:03:54.476
Grandparents are supposed to die!

1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:57.938
My wife was not supposed to die!

1:03:59.023 --> 1:04:00.315
My daughter...

1:04:01.650 --> 1:04:03.110
My daughter, David.

1:04:19.251 --> 1:04:21.545
Hey, there's my little munchkin.

1:04:24.715 --> 1:04:26.508
Hey, monkey, how are you?

1:04:29.136 --> 1:04:30.679
Hi, Uncle David.

1:04:31.638 --> 1:04:33.680
- Wanna play Go Fish?
- You bet I do.

1:04:33.682 --> 1:04:34.933
- And you know what?
- What?

1:04:35.059 --> 1:04:36.977
This time, I'm gonna deal.
And do you know why?

1:04:37.102 --> 1:04:39.188
- Why?
- 'Cause you cheat.

1:04:39.313 --> 1:04:40.898
- No, I don't.
- You do.

1:04:40.981 --> 1:04:43.692
Can I give you a kiss
on the forehead first? Ready?

1:04:47.863 --> 1:04:49.698
All right, card time. Who else is in?

1:04:50.949 --> 1:04:52.699
- Me.
- Dad?

1:04:52.701 --> 1:04:54.828
- I'll play, sure.
- Go Fish, that's right.

1:05:04.380 --> 1:05:05.714
She looked really good today.

1:05:06.715 --> 1:05:07.841
She's a trooper.

1:05:09.176 --> 1:05:10.511
Just like her mom.

1:05:11.136 --> 1:05:12.888
We'll come back in the morning, okay?

1:05:17.351 --> 1:05:19.186
We'll bring you a change of clothes.

1:05:23.107 --> 1:05:24.566
Thanks.

1:05:26.193 --> 1:05:27.236
Thank you.

1:05:39.248 --> 1:05:41.250
- Hi.
- Hi, Tom.

1:05:43.168 --> 1:05:45.546
I left you at a restaurant.

1:05:45.879 --> 1:05:48.966
- I don't know...
- It's okay. I understand.

1:05:49.091 --> 1:05:51.760
No, it's not.
I should have at least called.

1:05:54.138 --> 1:05:55.639
How's Tiffany?

1:06:01.812 --> 1:06:03.605
We're preparing.

1:06:05.566 --> 1:06:06.775
I'm so sorry.

1:06:08.610 --> 1:06:10.404
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

1:06:18.370 --> 1:06:19.663
Tiffany?

1:06:21.957 --> 1:06:23.917
Sarah, where's Tiffany?

1:06:31.925 --> 1:06:33.260
Hello?

1:06:33.802 --> 1:06:34.970
Hello?

1:06:36.597 --> 1:06:37.848
Anybody here?

1:06:39.183 --> 1:06:40.309
Hello?

1:06:42.686 --> 1:06:44.730
Can somebody help me, please?

1:06:55.824 --> 1:06:57.743
You thirst.

1:07:05.834 --> 1:07:07.503
What's going on here?

1:07:10.839 --> 1:07:12.674
Can you help me, please?

1:07:15.886 --> 1:07:17.846
Nurse, have you seen my daughter?

1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:21.475
Have you seen my wife, Sarah?

1:07:21.892 --> 1:07:24.353
Have you? Have you seen Sarah?

1:07:26.647 --> 1:07:28.732
Sarah, where are you?

1:07:30.651 --> 1:07:32.444
- Tiffany!
- <i>Tiffany.</i>

1:07:33.904 --> 1:07:35.322
Sarah?

1:07:36.281 --> 1:07:37.783
Tiffany?

1:07:37.866 --> 1:07:40.869
Drink and thirst no more.

1:07:42.871 --> 1:07:44.039
Drink.

1:07:46.041 --> 1:07:47.874
Thirst no more.

1:07:47.876 --> 1:07:50.003
I can't, it's empty.

1:07:50.879 --> 1:07:52.131
Drink.

1:07:52.256 --> 1:07:53.757
It's empty.

1:07:54.758 --> 1:07:58.345
You must drink and thirst no more.

1:08:00.264 --> 1:08:03.890
Drink and thirst no more.

1:08:03.892 --> 1:08:05.561
I can't, it's empty.

1:08:06.895 --> 1:08:07.896
I can't!

1:08:09.481 --> 1:08:11.692
Mr. Hatcher, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

1:08:15.237 --> 1:08:17.905
Mr. Hatcher, are you okay?

1:08:31.919 --> 1:08:32.963
Hey.

1:08:34.923 --> 1:08:36.258
How's she doing?

1:08:39.093 --> 1:08:40.387
How are you doing?

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:45.559
I could complain, but who's listening?

1:08:53.734 --> 1:08:54.943
I'm listening.

1:08:58.864 --> 1:09:00.783
The cancer has spread.

1:09:01.950 --> 1:09:03.118
It's everywhere.

1:09:05.412 --> 1:09:07.081
They've done all they can do,

1:09:08.123 --> 1:09:10.667
and now my... My daughter...

1:09:14.004 --> 1:09:15.963
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1:09:17.966 --> 1:09:19.093
It never is.

1:09:20.803 --> 1:09:21.970
That's it?

1:09:26.517 --> 1:09:31.855
The biggest
and most unanswered question

1:09:32.690 --> 1:09:34.191
of the human race is "Why?"

1:09:36.026 --> 1:09:37.611
"Why is this happening?"

1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:40.989
"Why now? Why me?"

1:09:43.367 --> 1:09:44.993
Twelve years ago,

1:09:45.994 --> 1:09:48.914
I find myself
sitting in an emergency room

1:09:50.457 --> 1:09:51.917
asking "Why?"

1:09:54.336 --> 1:09:56.547
"Why is this happening? Why me?

1:09:57.840 --> 1:09:59.007
"Why them?"

1:10:01.385 --> 1:10:05.389
I wasn't always a pastor.
I was an engineer.

1:10:06.890 --> 1:10:08.142
At Ford. I was married,

1:10:09.810 --> 1:10:11.020
had two kids.

1:10:11.687 --> 1:10:12.730
Two boys.

1:10:13.397 --> 1:10:14.815
Charles and Jake.

1:10:16.233 --> 1:10:17.484
They were good boys.

1:10:20.029 --> 1:10:21.030
What happened?

1:10:22.031 --> 1:10:25.032
She had just picked them up
from daycare,

1:10:25.034 --> 1:10:28.037
and they were headed to the mall
to buy me a birthday present.

1:10:30.205 --> 1:10:31.457
He crossed the median.

1:10:34.293 --> 1:10:36.045
<i>They were dead on impact.</i>

1:10:39.673 --> 1:10:45.721
So, I sat in the emergency room
and I asked "Why?"

1:10:51.894 --> 1:10:53.187
Is this where you tell me

1:10:54.063 --> 1:10:56.065
that God answered all your questions?

1:10:57.649 --> 1:10:58.692
No.

1:11:00.069 --> 1:11:01.779
We're always asking him why,

1:11:03.072 --> 1:11:05.532
and he rarely answers in that moment.

1:11:08.952 --> 1:11:10.162
Then why are you here?

1:11:11.872 --> 1:11:16.627
Because, Tom,
that wasn't the end of my story.

1:11:18.337 --> 1:11:22.091
In all my brokenness,
God wasn't done with me.

1:11:23.717 --> 1:11:27.930
In fact, it was that very brokenness
that allowed people

1:11:29.098 --> 1:11:31.975
to let me into their hurt,
and I discovered

1:11:32.643 --> 1:11:34.144
that I could be a light

1:11:35.104 --> 1:11:38.315
to others suffering in the darkness,

1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:40.776
and that is how I found life again.

1:11:41.110 --> 1:11:44.655
"Why" was the question
I asked 12 years ago.

1:11:46.990 --> 1:11:50.119
I finally asked,

1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:53.872
"What do you want me to do, God?"

1:11:56.750 --> 1:11:57.876
And?

1:11:59.211 --> 1:12:03.132
And I allowed God to work through me.

1:12:05.968 --> 1:12:09.680
Things started to change in my life,
a lot of things.

1:12:09.763 --> 1:12:12.683
When you live a life submitted to God,

1:12:12.766 --> 1:12:16.311
it's an adventure, and you never know
where it will take you.

1:12:18.022 --> 1:12:19.398
Which, I have learned

1:12:19.898 --> 1:12:23.694
includes me getting
punched in the jaw by a fireman.

1:12:25.070 --> 1:12:26.155
You're crazy.

1:12:28.198 --> 1:12:30.159
I'm a lot of things, Tom,

1:12:31.618 --> 1:12:33.162
but crazy's not one of them.

1:12:33.996 --> 1:12:34.997
Hi.

1:12:35.414 --> 1:12:36.415
Ooh.

1:12:37.082 --> 1:12:38.167
That's a nice picture.

1:12:39.418 --> 1:12:42.004
It's me, and that's everybody I know.

1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:44.923
That's very pretty.

1:12:47.968 --> 1:12:49.511
What's heaven like?

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:53.057
Well, it's a lot like here,

1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:57.186
only nobody's sick, everybody's happy.

1:12:57.394 --> 1:12:59.605
I don't wanna be sick anymore.

1:13:01.065 --> 1:13:03.359
- It stinks, huh?
- Yeah.

1:13:06.987 --> 1:13:09.656
Tiffany, can I pray for you?

1:13:10.574 --> 1:13:11.950
Okay.

1:13:15.454 --> 1:13:20.667
Dear God, touch little Tiffany.

1:13:22.211 --> 1:13:25.464
I pray peace and comfort

1:13:26.215 --> 1:13:27.466
for this family.

1:13:29.218 --> 1:13:32.388
We ask healing and comfort.

1:13:35.057 --> 1:13:37.768
Thank you, Lord,
for everything you've done,

1:13:39.603 --> 1:13:41.230
are doing and will do.

1:13:43.232 --> 1:13:45.025
- Amen.
- Amen.

1:14:12.886 --> 1:14:15.055
She was always so worried
about those ducks.

1:14:19.018 --> 1:14:20.102
Always.

1:14:28.152 --> 1:14:29.820
I couldn't find the words.

1:14:33.282 --> 1:14:34.450
All night, I wrote.

1:14:39.538 --> 1:14:40.664
It wasn't good enough.

1:14:44.835 --> 1:14:46.295
I couldn't find the words.

1:14:51.175 --> 1:14:53.302
Though Tiffany has left this world,

1:14:53.343 --> 1:14:56.889
she is more alive
than we could ever imagine.

1:14:58.724 --> 1:15:01.310
But here, our memories

1:15:02.311 --> 1:15:04.313
help keep her alive in our hearts.

1:15:06.315 --> 1:15:08.609
I was blessed... I am blessed

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:11.528
to have met Tiffany.

1:15:12.946 --> 1:15:14.323
It was only a month,

1:15:14.948 --> 1:15:16.533
a month I will always remember.

1:15:17.117 --> 1:15:21.497
A little girl spoke into my life,
and I am better for it.

1:15:23.207 --> 1:15:25.417
However, it's her father, Tom,

1:15:26.335 --> 1:15:28.087
that will keep her memory alive.

1:15:28.712 --> 1:15:30.005
At this time, I'd like to invite him

1:15:30.130 --> 1:15:33.340
to share with you
some of his cherished memories.

1:15:33.342 --> 1:15:34.426
Tom.

1:15:45.187 --> 1:15:46.522
I spent all night

1:15:47.648 --> 1:15:49.358
trying to write a eulogy

1:15:49.900 --> 1:15:51.318
worthy of her memory.

1:15:53.737 --> 1:15:55.197
Then I found this book.

1:16:01.370 --> 1:16:04.248
"This is a story
of how Tiffany Hatcher..."

1:16:04.373 --> 1:16:05.374
"...beat the devil.

1:16:06.375 --> 1:16:09.753
"My name is Tiffany Hatcher,
and I am six-and-a-half years old.

1:16:10.129 --> 1:16:12.339
"I have cancer,
but this isn't a sad story,

1:16:12.798 --> 1:16:14.383
"this is a happy story.

1:16:14.967 --> 1:16:16.635
"I live in Michigan with my daddy,

1:16:17.136 --> 1:16:19.346
"and we have a pond
in the neighborhood.

1:16:19.388 --> 1:16:20.387
"Ducks live there.

1:16:20.389 --> 1:16:24.143
"I like to play with them.
I think we're best friends.

1:16:24.601 --> 1:16:26.393
"My daddy is a fireman..."

1:16:26.395 --> 1:16:29.398
"My daddy is a fireman
and my mommy was a mommy.

1:16:30.983 --> 1:16:34.403
"She was the best mommy,
and we did everything together.

1:16:37.197 --> 1:16:40.242
"When Mommy got sick,
we were all sad."

1:16:40.492 --> 1:16:44.163
"...we were all sad.
Daddy cried a lot, and I prayed a lot.

1:16:44.496 --> 1:16:47.414
"When Mommy died,
I asked God to help Daddy.

1:16:47.416 --> 1:16:49.043
"We played again.

1:16:50.210 --> 1:16:51.503
"Then I got sick."

1:16:54.048 --> 1:16:55.424
"Then I got sick.

1:16:58.427 --> 1:17:00.220
"Daddy yelled at God a lot,

1:17:00.888 --> 1:17:02.639
"and I told God I was sorry.

1:17:05.809 --> 1:17:08.729
"One day,
I dreamed about Mommy and God,

1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:12.024
"and they told me
that Daddy would be okay."

1:17:12.107 --> 1:17:14.441
<i>"...and they told me
that Daddy would be okay.</i>

1:17:14.443 --> 1:17:16.111
<i>"They said I was a good girl,</i>

1:17:16.236 --> 1:17:18.614
"but I was still sad
because Daddy was sad."

1:17:19.448 --> 1:17:21.283
It'll be okay, Daddy.

1:17:21.533 --> 1:17:23.035
I know, bug.

1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:34.630
"Then, one day,
Pastor Dan came to see me.

1:17:35.464 --> 1:17:38.425
"He told me angels were our helpers.

1:17:38.467 --> 1:17:40.677
"I told him I saw an angel once.

1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:43.097
"He was nice."

1:17:43.931 --> 1:17:45.682
"I hope my ducks will be okay

1:17:45.766 --> 1:17:47.726
"and not miss me
as much as I'll miss them."

1:17:50.479 --> 1:17:51.480
So nice.

1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:03.492
This is how Tiffany Hatcher
beat the devil.

1:18:06.495 --> 1:18:08.580
She was an angel.

1:18:10.290 --> 1:18:11.500
My angel.

1:18:14.920 --> 1:18:17.548
Each day I spent with her was

1:18:19.508 --> 1:18:21.260
a tiny glimpse into heaven.

1:18:23.512 --> 1:18:26.974
She made me smile when I was sad.

1:18:28.517 --> 1:18:30.102
And she was so smart.

1:18:33.522 --> 1:18:36.025
And she often challenged
my own stubbornness.

1:18:38.193 --> 1:18:39.528
Just like her mom.

1:18:45.534 --> 1:18:49.288
I'm going to miss her
more than I could ever explain.

1:18:56.503 --> 1:18:57.546
Thank you.

1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:12.559
- Great sermon, great words.
- Thank you, Chief.

1:19:12.561 --> 1:19:14.396
- God bless you.
- Thank you, Chief.

1:19:14.521 --> 1:19:15.981
Bless you and your family.

1:19:16.065 --> 1:19:18.442
Thank you for coming. I appreciate it.

1:19:23.572 --> 1:19:25.572
Tommy, we're gonna
go back to the house now.

1:19:25.574 --> 1:19:28.035
- Everything okay?
- He's tired.

1:19:28.577 --> 1:19:30.996
First my Sarah, now this.

1:19:31.538 --> 1:19:33.582
I just can't be here anymore.

1:19:34.083 --> 1:19:35.542
Let me get you a ride, okay?

1:19:36.001 --> 1:19:37.252
We're gonna walk.

1:19:37.878 --> 1:19:39.046
Okay.

1:19:48.806 --> 1:19:50.224
Guys, take care.

1:20:00.192 --> 1:20:02.194
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

1:20:07.491 --> 1:20:08.617
Thank you.

1:20:12.996 --> 1:20:14.039
Hi, Tom.

1:20:14.498 --> 1:20:15.624
Thank you for coming.

1:20:20.295 --> 1:20:21.672
She was a special little girl.

1:20:22.631 --> 1:20:24.883
Please, let everyone
at the hospital know

1:20:25.259 --> 1:20:26.677
how much I appreciate them.

1:20:27.511 --> 1:20:29.054
You know,
in case I don't get a chance.

1:20:29.138 --> 1:20:30.139
I will.

1:20:30.639 --> 1:20:31.807
Thanks.

1:20:34.643 --> 1:20:37.521
Tom, I have something for you.

1:20:38.355 --> 1:20:39.648
It's from Tiffany.

1:20:40.649 --> 1:20:44.445
It's a letter, a note,
that we did together,

1:20:44.528 --> 1:20:47.823
but I swear she wrote it all herself
and it was all her own idea.

1:20:48.907 --> 1:20:51.035
I just feel kind of funny
giving it to you.

1:20:52.369 --> 1:20:54.288
I just could never keep it from you.

1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:59.666
Just, please, read it later, okay?

1:20:59.668 --> 1:21:00.711
Okay.

1:21:01.670 --> 1:21:02.671
Thank you.

1:21:10.888 --> 1:21:13.182
Hey, it was a beautiful service.

1:21:13.682 --> 1:21:15.684
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:21:16.268 --> 1:21:17.644
Hey, Pastor Underwood

1:21:17.686 --> 1:21:19.688
would like to see you in his office
if you have a minute.

1:21:19.813 --> 1:21:20.814
Sure.

1:21:20.898 --> 1:21:22.107
You don't to have to worry about them.

1:21:22.191 --> 1:21:24.818
No one's gonna leave
before they serve the chicken.

1:21:28.489 --> 1:21:30.199
Tom, come in. Sit down.

1:21:35.704 --> 1:21:38.082
This is for you. It's a Bible.

1:21:38.874 --> 1:21:40.084
I can see that.

1:21:41.377 --> 1:21:42.711
It's from Tiffany.

1:21:49.718 --> 1:21:54.098
"Dear Daddy,
Merry Christmas and Happy Birthday.

1:21:55.307 --> 1:21:56.725
"I love you. Tiffany."

1:21:58.727 --> 1:21:59.728
There's more.

1:22:04.942 --> 1:22:08.237
"Dear Tom, you gave your daughter
a good life,

1:22:09.029 --> 1:22:11.740
"and now it's time
to do the same for yourself.

1:22:12.866 --> 1:22:15.077
"Tiffany loved you very much,

1:22:16.745 --> 1:22:19.873
"but her love is nothing
compared to the love of the Father.

1:22:22.084 --> 1:22:24.545
"So use this book wisely, my friend.

1:22:25.462 --> 1:22:26.755
"Yours truly,

1:22:28.882 --> 1:22:30.342
"Dan Underwood."

1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:35.389
When I asked her if there
was something I could do for you,

1:22:35.472 --> 1:22:38.642
she said
she wanted to get you a Bible.

1:22:40.936 --> 1:22:43.689
When I asked her
if there was anything else, she said,

1:22:44.648 --> 1:22:46.483
"For my daddy to be happy."

1:22:49.695 --> 1:22:51.405
It's gonna take some time,

1:22:52.406 --> 1:22:54.783
and you'll never get over this,

1:22:56.493 --> 1:22:58.954
but I do hope that one day
you can be happy again.

1:23:02.374 --> 1:23:03.709
I'm lost.

1:23:03.792 --> 1:23:05.377
We all are.

1:23:06.795 --> 1:23:09.840
We're all alone until we realize that

1:23:10.591 --> 1:23:14.303
God is right there,
alongside us, always.

1:23:15.679 --> 1:23:18.307
He will never leave us or forsake us.

1:23:20.809 --> 1:23:22.478
I don't know what to do, Dan.

1:23:22.811 --> 1:23:24.188
Don't lose hope.

1:23:25.481 --> 1:23:26.857
Have faith.

1:23:28.609 --> 1:23:33.072
Can you feel it, even with all
of this garbage heaped upon you?

1:23:33.655 --> 1:23:34.656
Feel what?

1:23:35.032 --> 1:23:36.742
God's love.

1:23:37.826 --> 1:23:39.203
It's all around.

1:23:47.669 --> 1:23:51.048
Sarah said the same thing to me
just before she died.

1:23:57.262 --> 1:23:58.514
Thanks for everything.

1:23:59.890 --> 1:24:01.350
This is just the beginning.

1:24:29.378 --> 1:24:30.546
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

1:24:35.676 --> 1:24:39.930
<i>I'm not gonna be around much longer.
Dr. Robinson says so.</i>

1:24:41.890 --> 1:24:43.267
<i>I'm scared.</i>

1:24:44.893 --> 1:24:47.563
<i>But it's okay
because I wanna see Mommy.</i>

1:24:50.274 --> 1:24:52.359
<i>Nurse Melissa is really nice.</i>

1:24:55.070 --> 1:24:57.906
<i>She gives me ice cream
and reads me stories.</i>

1:24:59.742 --> 1:25:01.702
<i>I think you should marry her.</i>

1:25:05.289 --> 1:25:09.168
<i>I talk to Mommy when I dream
and Mommy likes her, too.</i>

1:25:12.921 --> 1:25:15.174
<i>I like getting to talk to Pastor Dan.</i>

1:25:15.299 --> 1:25:18.635
<i>I'm glad he's your friend,
and you're going to church again.</i>

1:25:20.387 --> 1:25:23.307
<i>You're a fireman,
and you know medicine, too.</i>

1:25:23.390 --> 1:25:25.267
<i>You can help people.</i>

1:25:26.185 --> 1:25:27.978
<i>Please let God work through you.</i>

1:25:29.855 --> 1:25:32.566
<i>I love you. Bye, Daddy.</i>
