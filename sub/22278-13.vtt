00:35.933 --> 00:38.400
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero...

00:38.433 --> 00:42.933
Every day is a struggle
to survive in the most
remote corners of the Arctic.

00:42.967 --> 00:45.300
CHIP: We're not at
the end of the road,
we are 300 miles away

00:45.333 --> 00:47.500
from the end of the road.

00:47.533 --> 00:50.733
NARRATOR: Alaskans
battle to overcome
extreme isolation...

00:50.767 --> 00:52.300
ANDY: There's no 911 out here.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.200
There's nobody
to come save your ass.

00:54.233 --> 00:56.000
NARRATOR:
...in life-threatening cold.

00:56.033 --> 01:00.067
GLENN: This environment is not
the climate the human body
is adapted to.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.667
NARRATOR:
When you carve out a life
miles from nowhere.

01:02.700 --> 01:07.000
ANDY: The only thing
you can rely on out here
is yourself and your skills.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.000
Only the tough survive, man.

01:09.033 --> 01:13.167
NARRATOR: Self-reliance is key
to an independent life
in the bush.

01:22.733 --> 01:25.700
NARRATOR: The landscape
in Alaska is vast.

01:25.733 --> 01:28.967
A place of merciless terrain,
extreme isolation

01:29.000 --> 01:31.667
and scarce resources.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.933
Relying on yourself
to source food
is critical to survival.

01:35.967 --> 01:38.800
But in hungry country,
this is no easy task.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.867
Kavik River camp is 197 miles
north of the Arctic Circle.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.000
Sue Aikens,
its sole caretaker,

01:50.033 --> 01:52.967
is isolated within
a massive tundra.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.200
Hundreds of miles
from the nearest store,

01:55.233 --> 01:58.167
she must rely only on herself
to stock enough meat.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.200
SUE: I don't disrespect
anybody who goes to
the local grocery store,

02:02.233 --> 02:07.300
but my grocery store
is out in the wild
in about a million acres.

02:07.333 --> 02:12.000
When I go out there,
there's no telling
what's gonna be on sale.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.200
NARRATOR: Sue is on
the hunt for caribou.

02:14.233 --> 02:16.433
But in the wide open field
of the tundra,

02:16.467 --> 02:18.967
she has to get close
and stay hidden

02:19.000 --> 02:20.633
or lose her shot.

02:22.367 --> 02:26.233
(PANTING) If you look
of the six that are there,

02:26.267 --> 02:29.033
you can only see
one and a half.

02:29.067 --> 02:32.600
If you can't see them,
they can't see you.

02:32.633 --> 02:36.433
So, I'm trying to use
the topography of the
area in my favour,

02:36.467 --> 02:38.867
but as you see,
it's not like I have
a forest to hide behind.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.300
So, I have to use
what nature gives me.

02:49.133 --> 02:51.500
And there they run,
quick bastards.

02:53.533 --> 02:55.767
They know something's up, man.

02:57.067 --> 02:58.533
(WHISPERS) Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

03:11.833 --> 03:12.833
(GUNSHOT)

03:17.467 --> 03:19.367
-Let's go see what I got.
-(COCKS RIFLE)

03:20.633 --> 03:22.933
All right, little caribou.

03:22.967 --> 03:26.167
Well, I got him.

03:26.200 --> 03:31.667
This animal gave up its life
so that I, you know,
can eat this winter.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.600
Time to get him done now.

03:33.633 --> 03:35.767
I'm gonna walk back here,

03:35.800 --> 03:39.133
and, uh, get the four wheeler,
get my knives,

03:39.167 --> 03:40.433
get him set up, cut him up,

03:40.467 --> 03:43.267
get him in the bag,
get him cooled down.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.900
Yeah, I could have hung out
and tried to get the other
little dudes,

03:45.933 --> 03:48.067
but, uh, let's take care
of what I got, first.

03:48.100 --> 03:51.100
Get that taken care of
and then see what else
is out there.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.133
Winter's gonna come
in with a roar.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.933
And I need to be
ready for that.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.867
NARRATOR: Fourteen miles
downriver from Eagle, Alaska,

03:59.900 --> 04:02.167
Andy Bassich and
Kate Rorke-Bassich

04:02.200 --> 04:06.033
have created
a wilderness paradise
along the Yukon River.

04:06.067 --> 04:09.167
But to sustain their team
of 25 sled-dogs,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.733
they need to pull
thousands of salmon
from the river

04:11.767 --> 04:14.067
using an ancient
form of fishing.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.033
ANDY: It's kind of
an automatic fishing machine,

04:19.067 --> 04:20.667
it's relentless.

04:20.700 --> 04:24.533
There's no motors,
it's all by the power
of the river.

04:24.567 --> 04:28.133
I could stick this
fish wheel in and
I'll catch 500 fish a day.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.267
ANDY: It's a chilly day
on the Yukon,

04:43.300 --> 04:46.167
second day of fishing and, uh,

04:46.200 --> 04:48.200
it's not a very pleasant day
to be cutting fish,

04:48.233 --> 04:50.067
it's not a very good day
for drying fish,

04:50.100 --> 04:53.500
but it's a day that
has to be done.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.733
Oh, looks like
the boxes are overflowing.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.700
Fish are flopping out.

04:58.733 --> 04:59.933
(CHUCKLES)

05:02.633 --> 05:04.500
Welcome to my world.

05:06.933 --> 05:10.433
The fish wheels
are really wet all the time
because of the splashing.

05:10.467 --> 05:12.533
The snow is very wet
and very slippery,

05:12.567 --> 05:16.100
so I've got to be
extra careful today
walking around on the wheel.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.633
When you're by yourself,
you can't take chances.

05:18.667 --> 05:22.733
And there is nobody
out there to help me
if I fall in or smack my head.

05:22.767 --> 05:25.133
There's no 911 out here.

05:25.167 --> 05:30.233
So how's this for
putting fish on ice,
right out of the water, huh?

05:31.367 --> 05:32.667
(CHUCKLES)

05:33.933 --> 05:37.067
The Seattle fish market's
got nothing on me.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.167
I'm totally self-taught,
I've never gone to
school for anything.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.333
I've never really had
any close mentors
to teach me things.

05:43.367 --> 05:45.300
I just kinda
figure it out as I go.

05:45.333 --> 05:48.733
You kinda become
jack of all trades,
living this lifestyle.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.300
But I enjoy that.
I love inventing things.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.733
This lifestyle
allows me to do that

05:53.767 --> 05:56.733
pretty much unencumbered by
anybody or any other thing.

05:56.767 --> 05:59.233
It's a very satisfying
way of living for me.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.133
So there's, uh,
360 fish in the boat.

06:05.167 --> 06:09.867
Probably about 400, 450 fish
by the end of the day.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.433
So that'll be a good start.

06:17.633 --> 06:21.533
NARRATOR: 600 miles
south of the Arctic circle,
on Kodiak Island,

06:21.567 --> 06:23.600
subsistence hunter
Erik Salitan

06:23.633 --> 06:27.067
is on a quest to
stock enough meat
for the winter.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.233
He relies on years
of hunting experience

06:29.267 --> 06:33.733
to find the meat he needs
to survive the brutal
months ahead.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.333
ERIK: We're here in
Kodiak Island, sitting on
the side of a mountain

06:36.367 --> 06:38.100
in a 40-mile-an-hour wind.

06:38.133 --> 06:40.633
Sow and cubs feeding
on the tundra down below us.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.400
What can go wrong?
Life is good.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.167
I'm gonna bite my lip
and see if I can't grind out

06:45.200 --> 06:47.033
another 1,000 vertical feet.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.700
We've climbed more than
two-thirds of the way up.
It's been a good haul.

06:58.733 --> 07:02.300
Just hoping the goats are
still there when I get there.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.833
There's a halfway decent one.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.500
(WIND HOWLING)

07:10.000 --> 07:11.767
It's blowing so hard,
when it gusts,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.500
I gotta get down
right against the ground

07:13.533 --> 07:15.233
or I'll get knocked over.

07:15.267 --> 07:18.367
Basically, just got my
butt kicked on top
of a mountain.

07:22.967 --> 07:24.833
(ERIK SPEAKING)

07:37.967 --> 07:38.967
(GUNSHOT)

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Watch out.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.000
There goes my goat.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.600
One shot kill.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.400
This is the first goat
I've actually shot myself,
personally.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.900
Pretty awesome.

08:00.733 --> 08:03.333
Taking the back strap
off here.

08:03.367 --> 08:05.267
Tasty, tender piece.

08:14.733 --> 08:17.300
I took all of the edible meat
off the goat here.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.400
I'm loading it up
into this game bag.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.200
I kept the meat on the bone,

08:21.233 --> 08:23.867
which keeps it in
much better condition.

08:23.900 --> 08:30.167
I'm estimating my pack to be
about 100 pounds with the meat
and the hide and the skull.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.667
(EXHALES)

08:31.700 --> 08:34.067
Now we gotta get back
to camp in one piece.

08:35.367 --> 08:36.933
NARRATOR: High
in the Brooks Range,

08:36.967 --> 08:38.967
two-hundred miles
from the nearest town,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.267
and 60 miles from
the nearest road,

08:41.300 --> 08:46.133
Glenn Villeneuve,
lives an isolated
and primitive existence.

08:46.167 --> 08:48.967
In order to survive
solely off the land,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.267
he utilises every bit
of the animals he hunts.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.400
GLENN: A lot of my energy goes
into getting food out here.

08:55.433 --> 08:58.867
And not only getting the food,
but preserving the food,

08:58.900 --> 09:01.700
preparing the food,
eating the food.

09:01.733 --> 09:03.200
I'm gonna take

09:03.233 --> 09:05.433
couple of these heads
and get 'em thawn out,

09:05.467 --> 09:07.467
so we can skin 'em

09:07.500 --> 09:10.167
and eat 'em.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.333
There's a lot of good food
inside the head of caribou,

09:13.367 --> 09:15.533
or inside the head
of any animal.

09:15.567 --> 09:18.667
When you're eating
mostly animals for food,

09:18.700 --> 09:22.233
and not too much
in the way of plants,

09:22.267 --> 09:26.133
you need to eat as much
fat as you can find usually,

09:26.167 --> 09:27.833
or you'll get really sick.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.333
There's the eyeball
right there.

09:31.367 --> 09:35.300
And right behind that eye,
there's going to be
a nice chunk of fat.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.733
And then you can start to
pull out some of that eye fat.

09:38.767 --> 09:41.800
That's... That right there
is just delicious fat.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.633
Mmm.

09:46.733 --> 09:48.533
That's really delicious fat.

09:50.133 --> 09:53.533
And I'm also gonna
take the brain out
and fry the brain.

09:53.567 --> 09:56.433
I just happen to like
brains fried best.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.633
There.
Right through the brain.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.600
Oil up the eyeballs.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.767
And the brains,
I'll just scoop out.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.167
They probably look like
scrambled eggs
to a lot of people.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.233
Mmm.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.567
I really like brains,
it's pretty powerful food.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.000
You eat this stuff

10:29.033 --> 10:30.867
and you got energy
to run these mountains

10:30.900 --> 10:32.600
and look for more
of this food.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.100
If I was eating
store-bought food,

10:34.133 --> 10:36.667
I don't know if I'd be able to
get around these mountains
the way I do.

10:39.967 --> 10:44.700
NARRATOR: Noorvik, Alaska,
is a remote village, 19 miles
north of the Arctic Circle,

10:44.733 --> 10:47.433
and home to Chip
and Agnes Hailstone.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.267
CHIP: Well, I guess we're
gonna go fishing again today.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.967
The fish weren't
biting yesterday,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.333
but, um, you know,
that's fishing.

10:54.367 --> 10:55.667
So we're gonna give
it another try.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.533
We could get a sled load,
we might even get nothing,

10:57.567 --> 11:00.233
but we won't know
if we don't try,
so we're off.

11:01.633 --> 11:04.933
NARRATOR: During winter,
they are completely isolated,

11:04.967 --> 11:09.367
and must travel
the frozen Arctic waterways
in order to find enough food.

11:12.167 --> 11:14.533
(AGNES SPEAKING)

11:15.533 --> 11:17.667
(CHIP SPEAKING)

11:17.700 --> 11:19.267
(AGNES SPEAKING)

11:25.333 --> 11:28.500
CHIP: Other people are
out here all the time
looking for fish.

11:28.533 --> 11:30.467
And, um, when we come
across their holes

11:30.500 --> 11:33.167
where people have
been lucky, then we're lucky.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.400
We don't have to dig so deep.

11:34.433 --> 11:35.667
The fish move.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.533
You know, like, this could be
the hottest hole that there is

11:38.567 --> 11:42.733
for a whole day and tomorrow,
there'll be nothing at all.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.667
In the same manner, the holes
that didn't produce today

11:44.700 --> 11:46.600
might just be
the hottest places
to be tomorrow.

11:46.633 --> 11:49.533
So, we don't know
until we try.

11:49.567 --> 11:50.667
Just keep trying.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.667
Oh, there we go!
There we go.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.500
Oh, Tiktaalik!

12:00.800 --> 12:02.500
Oh, I got one!

12:02.533 --> 12:05.267
-Yes! Ah!
-Oh, a good one, too! Big one!

12:05.300 --> 12:08.067
-(EXCLAIMING)
-CHIP: Oh, my God!

12:08.100 --> 12:09.400
Holy shit!
Where is your hook?

12:09.433 --> 12:10.800
AGNES: I don't know!

12:11.533 --> 12:12.667
(AGNES SPEAKING)

12:13.267 --> 12:14.467
CHIP: I'm gonna cut us.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.800
-(AGNES EXCLAIMS)
-Whoa!

12:16.833 --> 12:18.500
-All right!
-We got one. Yeah!

12:18.533 --> 12:20.600
You need your hook
by your hole.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.300
AGNES: Now this is what
you call a sheefish.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.400
This is what we're after.

12:25.433 --> 12:28.500
It's a pretty good size.
It has a lot of meat.

12:28.533 --> 12:31.433
Sweet meat. Pretty good.

12:32.467 --> 12:35.433
CHIP: Well, that's all the way
past your waist.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.200
Well, we got one
big sheefish,

12:37.233 --> 12:39.033
and then we got ourselves
four smaller ones,

12:39.067 --> 12:41.267
and we got ourselves
a couple of small Tiktaalik.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.933
And, um, if you had to go
buy the equivalent in a store,

12:43.967 --> 12:46.033
probably could run you
300 or 400 bucks.

12:46.067 --> 12:50.867
So, um, coming out here
and doing this is definitely
worth our time and our effort,

12:50.900 --> 12:54.400
and we actually save
money by buying gas
instead of food at the store.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.133
That's quite a few meals
right there, all right.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.400
Yeah, looks like it. Yum!

12:58.433 --> 13:01.767
We're gonna jump on our
snow machines and we're gonna
head off to Noorvik,

13:01.800 --> 13:04.667
and have ourselves
a nice little trip home with
some smiles on our faces.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.767
NARRATOR:
Self-reliance in the Arctic
requires ingenuity.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.733
With limited resources,
a pair of skilled hands

13:16.767 --> 13:19.600
can be the difference
between life and death.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.967
For Glenn Villeneuve,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.033
maintaining
an independent lifestyle

13:25.067 --> 13:28.933
requires utilising every
hidden resource
surrounding his camp.

13:28.967 --> 13:31.033
GLENN: That's
what I'm looking for.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.967
Nice, big, grass leaves.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.500
NARRATOR: As a
wilderness purist,

13:35.533 --> 13:38.500
he still creates
his fire by hand.

13:38.533 --> 13:42.067
I have to be really careful
not to get the grass wet.

13:42.100 --> 13:45.033
It's pretty warm out,
12 degrees above zero.

13:45.067 --> 13:49.667
So if I get any snow on
my hands or in my pocket,

13:49.700 --> 13:53.433
it starts melting right away,
and the grass will get wet.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.967
And that is bad.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.667
GLENN: Almost all
the trees in this valley
are white spruce.

14:03.700 --> 14:07.900
But the type I'm looking for,
a balsam poplar,

14:07.933 --> 14:09.300
is a very different tree.

14:09.333 --> 14:13.433
And I know an area where
there's a little grove
of poplar trees.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.400
Rather than cutting
a standing tree,

14:17.433 --> 14:20.000
I might be able to find
a good piece of wood

14:20.033 --> 14:21.967
on the ground
from a tree that fell over.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.833
I can see where some
poplar trees here

14:23.867 --> 14:26.700
have died and fallen over
underneath the snow.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.633
(CLUNKING)

14:31.667 --> 14:33.367
There. That's a piece
of wood right there.

14:36.967 --> 14:39.567
This is the piece I want.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.133
This section in here.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.700
'Cause inside
this piece of wood,

14:42.733 --> 14:44.600
there's a fireboard
and a spindle.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.167
I just haven't found it yet.

14:50.433 --> 14:55.100
Yeah. I just split
off a piece that

14:55.133 --> 14:57.500
I think will work pretty good
for the board.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.867
I've got my spindle.

15:09.800 --> 15:14.400
I'm gonna try and build
a fire and cook some
dinner right here.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.033
I'm just taking
some of the grass

15:16.067 --> 15:18.267
and breaking it up.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.400
Go right in the middle
where the ember's going to go.

15:21.433 --> 15:22.967
(EXHALES)

15:27.700 --> 15:29.133
(STICK RUSTLING)

15:36.267 --> 15:38.167
(EXHALES) I've got an ember.

15:40.567 --> 15:44.100
It's just so beautiful
to see that first ember.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.667
When I'm drilling away
like that,

15:46.700 --> 15:50.167
and it's all dark and then you
see this little orange glow.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.633
But you don't
wanna stop too soon.

15:51.667 --> 15:54.333
You just keep going
until you can't hold
your breath any more.

15:54.367 --> 15:58.233
'Cause all the smoke's
rolling up, you have to stop
breathing at some point,

15:58.267 --> 15:59.933
and you just keep on trucking.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.967
There's just something
special about these tools.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.533
They just feel great.
I mean...

16:05.567 --> 16:09.200
Just to think that you can
just take a tree that's laying
under the snow,

16:09.233 --> 16:11.467
and you can make
a fire out of it.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.100
Think of all the people
that've done this

16:14.133 --> 16:16.000
for thousands and
thousands of years,

16:16.033 --> 16:18.533
people have been
building fires this way.

16:18.567 --> 16:21.167
They just stopped
doing that recently.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.533
Most of the time people
have been on Earth,

16:22.567 --> 16:24.467
this is how they've been
building fires, you know.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.700
I live this way
because I enjoy it.

16:28.733 --> 16:33.767
I could be laying in
a hammock on the beach
in Thailand if I wanted to be.

16:34.767 --> 16:37.767
But I'm not. I just have
a lot of fun up here.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.300
NARRATOR: For Erik,
money earned from trapping,

16:45.333 --> 16:48.533
helps maintain a solitary,
independent lifestyle.

16:53.467 --> 16:57.100
I'm trying to construct
a box here to put
a 330 Conibear in.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.767
Something I've never done.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.700
I'm not that good
a carpenter.

17:01.733 --> 17:03.967
But I don't think
the animals will notice.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.133
Okay.

17:20.167 --> 17:23.100
I think my cubby set box
is going to work.

17:23.133 --> 17:25.467
So the idea is,

17:25.500 --> 17:28.900
the bait is placed
in the back of the cubby.

17:28.933 --> 17:32.000
The animal comes along,
he sees the bait in the back,

17:32.033 --> 17:35.400
he goes in, he hits
this trigger mechanism.

17:35.433 --> 17:36.600
Snap!

17:36.633 --> 17:39.267
It instantly kills him
and it's a real humane way

17:39.300 --> 17:41.133
to harvest foxes
or wolverines.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.733
So, I think we succeeded.

17:49.267 --> 17:50.767
So I'm excited
to give it a try.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.833
You know, everything up here
is trial and error,

17:52.867 --> 17:55.033
but with error, you know,
there's a price to be paid.

17:55.067 --> 17:59.267
So, if I waste part of the
trapping season fooling around
with these cubby boxes,

17:59.300 --> 18:00.967
and Conibears and I
don't have any success,

18:01.000 --> 18:02.833
that's time wasted,
fur I didn't catch.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.567
And if I'm not catching fur,

18:04.600 --> 18:09.067
I'm wasting money,
and I'm not into wasting
anything up here.

18:09.100 --> 18:12.433
I've made it up
to the area I want to trap.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.200
Nice fox track here.

18:14.233 --> 18:15.933
I'm gonna try
to set up in this bank.

18:15.967 --> 18:18.233
Hopefully this will attract
the fox to this area

18:18.267 --> 18:19.500
and we'll catch 'em.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.600
I hope we have some luck.

18:21.633 --> 18:25.867
Use my handy trap setter here,
and try not to break my arm.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.100
So I'm learning as I go

18:30.133 --> 18:32.100
and whenever you're
learning anything new,

18:32.133 --> 18:33.767
there's a learning curve.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.967
Gotta pay really
close attention here.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.067
You make a mistake,
cost you a finger or worse.

18:39.100 --> 18:42.100
So, to be honest,
I am kinda scared
of these traps.

18:42.133 --> 18:43.733
I'm just not very
experienced with them,

18:43.767 --> 18:46.100
so I try to use
a lot of caution.

18:46.133 --> 18:49.667
It's pretty cold right now,
it's about 20 below zero...

18:49.700 --> 18:52.233
Oh! That wasn't cool.

18:56.633 --> 18:58.000
Oh, fuck.

19:02.167 --> 19:04.000
Well, I caught my hand in it.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.000
Didn't feel particularly good.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.133
Oh, yeah. That...

19:12.167 --> 19:14.700
I guess that's part
of the learning curve.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.733
Forced to work without
a glove right now,

19:23.767 --> 19:26.433
to get my glove
out of the trap.

19:26.467 --> 19:28.333
It's not all that fun.

19:29.767 --> 19:32.833
Stupid shit like that,
where you

19:32.867 --> 19:35.600
are operating
when you're tired,

19:38.233 --> 19:40.333
in the cold,

19:40.367 --> 19:43.133
doing stuff by yourself,

19:43.167 --> 19:45.300
you smash your hand open.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.867
You can get yourself
in trouble out here, so...

19:50.100 --> 19:52.967
(WINCES) At least
my arm's not stuck in it.

19:57.567 --> 20:01.967
NARRATOR: Living independently
in the Alaskan bush requires
constant invention.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.100
Transforming raw materials
into practical tools
is critical to survival.

20:13.033 --> 20:16.967
In Noorvik, bartering
is an essential part
of village lifestyle.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.067
CHIP: Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)

20:20.100 --> 20:21.767
CHIP: That'll work good, man.
MAN: Right on.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.633
(CHUCKLES) Let's take it
to the back and you can
check out the caribou meats.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.533
NARRATOR: After
trading caribou meat
for an old oil drum,

20:28.567 --> 20:31.633
Chip is making
a portable wood stove
he can use for warmth

20:31.667 --> 20:33.900
in the brutally
cold months ahead.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.500
Here you go.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.933
CHIP: It's really important
that you be able to do
for yourself up here.

20:39.967 --> 20:42.533
There's no point in me trying
to earn money to get myself

20:42.567 --> 20:44.700
a new stove,
when I could just make one.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.500
So right here
I've got my doorway.

20:54.767 --> 20:55.967
You ain't got something
and you want it,

20:56.000 --> 20:57.400
you gotta make it yourself,

20:57.433 --> 20:59.167
or do without.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.367
All the materials are coming
right off this drum.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.100
I'm folding the
edges of the door
so nobody gets cut

21:06.133 --> 21:08.400
when we're using this thing,
and so that when
it's in my sled,

21:08.433 --> 21:10.833
and I pack stuff, it's not
going to slice my gear up.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.800
This is no place
to do things half-assed.

21:12.833 --> 21:13.833
Nope.

21:23.167 --> 21:26.267
This piece I'm putting on
right now is the door hatch.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.367
So this will let
the door open and close.

21:30.067 --> 21:31.733
It's stiff enough.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.167
It'll stay up
when you open the door,

21:33.200 --> 21:35.967
whoosh, or more like that.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.267
Probably that way.
Open up, close, latch.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.300
Put your wood in.

21:42.333 --> 21:45.067
Over here you got a big enough
area for a frying pan.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.900
Right there you got
a big enough area
for a coffee pot.

21:47.933 --> 21:51.167
Right there and go
right up the stove.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.633
And to think, I got a drum
with a piece of caribou.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.300
Now I have a stove.

21:55.333 --> 21:57.967
And what sets this stove
apart from others is,
you live in a tent,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.433
and you plan
on being mobile,

21:59.467 --> 22:01.100
you don't want to carry
the ashes with you.

22:01.133 --> 22:03.067
You don't want to...
You wanna make everything
as light as possible.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.233
Possessions are a burden

22:04.267 --> 22:05.700
when you live out of
a snow machine and a sled.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.767
The first time we want
to stoke it and make
the whole thing really hot

22:13.800 --> 22:16.900
so we can get rid
of any kind of
stove oil or gasoline

22:16.933 --> 22:19.400
that may be still sitting
inside the steel.

22:19.433 --> 22:21.467
It's a kind of a way
of cleaning it,
cleaning it with fire.

22:24.067 --> 22:25.767
NARRATOR: In Eagle,
winter is looming,

22:25.800 --> 22:27.833
and it's time for Andy
to hunt bigger game.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.933
NARRATOR: Store-bought food
comes at a premium cost.

22:33.967 --> 22:35.833
But a buck fifty
home-made bullet

22:35.867 --> 22:38.333
can bring him
1,600 pounds of meat.

22:40.167 --> 22:43.400
(SIGHS) I should have fucking
waited a little longer.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.700
This moose is going to be
a pain in the ass to get out.

22:45.733 --> 22:47.300
He is three feet in the water

22:47.333 --> 22:49.433
and 30 yards
out into a slough,

22:49.467 --> 22:53.267
but, uh, he's down
and that's good.

22:53.300 --> 22:57.767
So I'm going to head on back
and then try and get him
out of here tomorrow.

23:03.867 --> 23:07.100
KATE: Hey! Pumpkins!
(MIMICKING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC)

23:07.133 --> 23:10.133
Andy got the moose last night,
which is great.

23:10.167 --> 23:12.867
So Andy's just working on

23:12.900 --> 23:15.400
an invention
to get this going.

23:17.467 --> 23:20.333
ANDY: I came up with the idea
of building an Andyboggan.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.833
So I found an old toboggan,

23:21.867 --> 23:24.933
welded up a couple of axles
for it real quick,

23:24.967 --> 23:26.867
put some wheelbarrow wheels
under it.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.267
-(BARKING)
-And I'm going to take
a couple of dogs

23:29.300 --> 23:31.367
down there
and put them to work,

23:31.400 --> 23:33.000
hauling this moose out for me.

23:33.033 --> 23:34.833
KATE: Let's go get a moose!

23:34.867 --> 23:37.267
ANDY: Come on, Tope.

23:37.967 --> 23:39.000
Good girl.

23:47.167 --> 23:49.100
KATE: Last thing I want to see
when we get there

23:49.133 --> 23:51.767
is a big old grizzly
mawing down on our moose,

23:51.800 --> 23:54.167
or a black bear.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.633
ANDY: Straight ahead!

23:57.667 --> 23:58.800
Straight ahead!

23:58.833 --> 24:00.767
ANDY: Good girl, Drachma.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.867
Everything looks
good this morning.

24:06.900 --> 24:10.067
It looks like the ravens got
into it a little, but not bad,

24:10.100 --> 24:12.467
and, uh, everything
feels really cold.

24:23.700 --> 24:29.367
Hindquarters have probably
the bulk of the big roasts
and things like that.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.933
This is what your food's
supposed to look like.

24:31.967 --> 24:33.433
(LAUGHING)

24:39.900 --> 24:42.933
Attaboys, let's go.
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

24:45.167 --> 24:46.633
Attaboys.

24:48.333 --> 24:51.433
We've got about a mile
to haul this moose out.

24:51.467 --> 24:53.633
So the idea is the dogs
do the work

24:53.667 --> 24:55.133
and I just have to walk along

24:55.167 --> 24:57.233
so I don't have to pack
anything here.

24:57.267 --> 24:58.367
Hup! Hup!

24:58.400 --> 24:59.900
Come on, let's go.

24:59.933 --> 25:03.067
Attaboys. Good job.
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

25:03.100 --> 25:04.767
This is a pretty
economical moose.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.333
He's cost me one bullet,

25:06.367 --> 25:10.167
couple gallons of gas,
and that's going to mean
protein and meat for us

25:10.200 --> 25:11.400
for a whole year.

25:13.267 --> 25:15.933
So the moose is in the boat.
Dogs did their work.

25:15.967 --> 25:19.367
The Andyboggan worked.
So it's been a good day.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.967
It's a long day,
I'm pretty pooped,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.167
but the hardest part is over,
getting him out,

25:23.200 --> 25:24.567
and all we have to do now

25:24.600 --> 25:26.100
is hang him up
in the smokehouse,

25:26.133 --> 25:28.333
and we're set for the winter.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.600
NARRATOR: Life
in the Alaskan wilderness

25:32.633 --> 25:35.733
requires constant
problem solving.

25:35.767 --> 25:38.700
Clever fixes and the ability
to be resourceful

25:38.733 --> 25:41.200
are key to an
independent lifestyle.

25:42.333 --> 25:45.133
For Erik, living alone
in the Alaskan bush

25:45.167 --> 25:48.500
means repairing
essential items
by any means necessary.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.633
ERIK: Today, we're going
to change this stovepipe out.

25:52.667 --> 25:53.700
It's kind of beat down.

25:53.733 --> 25:56.000
A windstorm, uh,
damaged the old one,

25:56.033 --> 25:59.433
and I had to scrap together
these pieces here,

25:59.467 --> 26:01.100
out of just some pipe
I had laying around,

26:01.133 --> 26:03.767
to get through,
but it's a real fire hazard.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.900
Could easily burn
my house down.

26:08.233 --> 26:12.067
This is going to be
the piece that is right
above the stove itself.

26:12.100 --> 26:15.300
So we need to put a hole
in the centre of the pipe

26:15.333 --> 26:18.867
and it's essential that the
hole is centred and straight,

26:18.900 --> 26:20.967
and that's where our flue
is going to go, our damper,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.200
and that's how you
shut down the stove

26:23.233 --> 26:25.800
so that you can control
the temperature
in which it burns.

26:25.833 --> 26:28.233
My little way of
putting that hole in

26:28.267 --> 26:29.700
is with a .22 handgun.

26:32.533 --> 26:35.400
Got to make sure
it's perfectly straight.

26:35.433 --> 26:38.500
And we're going to
centre it just right.

26:39.967 --> 26:42.700
-(CLUNKS)
-And let's see how we did.

26:48.900 --> 26:52.233
Pretty good.
Let's go put it in.

26:52.267 --> 26:56.200
Take the old pipe out.
Try not to make a mess.
(GROANS)

26:57.700 --> 26:58.767
Make a mess.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.400
We are north
of the Arctic Circle

27:00.433 --> 27:03.667
and it can get
to 60 below zero here,

27:03.700 --> 27:07.933
so staying warm and having
a good wood stove
is really important.

27:07.967 --> 27:10.267
Looks good.
I'm happy with it.

27:11.267 --> 27:14.000
Light the virgin fire here.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.333
Appears to be drawn well.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.833
Get back to doing
some other things.

27:21.367 --> 27:24.400
NARRATOR:
For Sue, living alone
within a vast tundra

27:24.433 --> 27:28.533
means medical attention
is hundreds of miles away.

27:28.567 --> 27:30.633
Creating her own means
of staying healthy

27:30.667 --> 27:32.600
is essential to her survival.

27:32.633 --> 27:34.533
I have a way that I can
take care of myself

27:34.567 --> 27:36.633
and kill some of the
bacteria or viruses

27:36.667 --> 27:38.033
that may be trying
to attack me.

27:38.067 --> 27:40.100
Bacteria cannot live
in the presence of

27:40.133 --> 27:42.067
silver or gold particles.

27:42.100 --> 27:47.467
There is a thing called
colloidal silver water
that I want to make.

27:47.500 --> 27:54.100
And an electrical charge
is going to allow molecules
of this silver

27:54.133 --> 27:57.433
to come off of the strand
and become suspended.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.900
So many parts per billion
in the water.

28:00.933 --> 28:03.967
I take just a tiniest bit
of sea salt.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.833
It's an electrolyte.

28:05.867 --> 28:09.067
It will help conduct
the current better.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.333
You do not need much.

28:13.033 --> 28:18.067
$10, $15 worth of silver
is going to save me

28:19.533 --> 28:23.900
$5,000, $10,000 in
flights and antibiotics,

28:23.933 --> 28:27.100
if I want to fly
and see the doctor.

28:27.133 --> 28:31.633
I can't afford to be down
because I'm sick.

28:31.667 --> 28:33.833
It's arming myself
on the inside.

28:33.867 --> 28:35.833
I put guns all around camp
to keep me safe

28:35.867 --> 28:38.400
from the big creepy-crawlies.

28:38.433 --> 28:40.867
I got to put little silver
bullets in my body

28:40.900 --> 28:43.533
to take care of the tiny
creepy-crawlies.

28:43.567 --> 28:45.033
Bottoms up to my health.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.367
NARRATOR: In Chandalar,
Glenn's survival

28:56.400 --> 29:00.733
depends heavily
on his ability to source fuel
from his surroundings.

29:00.767 --> 29:02.100
GLENN: Firewood
is important out here.

29:02.133 --> 29:05.667
I spent a lot of time
cutting wood
all through the year.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.133
It's one of the bigger
jobs I have to do.

29:08.167 --> 29:12.100
I don't have any other
source of heat
other than a wood fire.

29:12.133 --> 29:16.067
I use it for heating hot water
and I have a fire going
24 hours a day

29:16.100 --> 29:17.400
through the winter.

29:17.433 --> 29:20.800
In the spring
and in the summer,
I still use the fire.

29:20.833 --> 29:22.267
I couldn't live out here
without a fire.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.367
This looks like a good area
to cut some trees.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.633
There's enough dead trees
in close proximity

29:31.667 --> 29:33.433
that I can build
a pile right here.

29:33.467 --> 29:36.100
This forest is all white
spruce through here,

29:36.133 --> 29:38.667
and I only cut dead ones
for firewood.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.667
And I've depleted
all the dead trees

29:40.700 --> 29:43.267
within 300 or 400
yards of my camp,

29:43.300 --> 29:45.467
so I have to come quite
a ways now to get wood.

29:46.733 --> 29:49.300
Looks like a good one
to start on right here.

29:55.800 --> 30:00.633
A lot of people don't realise
how much you can get done
with a simple hand-tool

30:00.667 --> 30:03.933
because they grew up
in a world that was
all mechanised,

30:03.967 --> 30:08.200
and they never learned
how to use tools like this
or how to work like this.

30:10.867 --> 30:12.633
Oh! I broke my axe!

30:14.800 --> 30:16.067
I was out cutting
wood tonight,

30:16.100 --> 30:18.533
and I broke my axe handle.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.500
You just have to know
how to fix it

30:20.533 --> 30:22.233
and you have to have
a few tools

30:22.267 --> 30:25.300
and you have to have
a new handle,
which I've got.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.333
I'm just going to saw it off.

30:32.533 --> 30:35.433
Now I've to put a new handle
on this head.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.900
I enjoy maintaining
my own tools out here.

30:37.933 --> 30:40.767
When you're using a tool that
you've put together yourself,

30:40.800 --> 30:43.000
you know, you have a different
relationship to it.

30:43.033 --> 30:44.533
You feel

30:44.567 --> 30:46.533
more connected to it
than one that you bought

30:46.567 --> 30:49.000
that was already assembled.

30:49.033 --> 30:52.500
The nearest place where
I can get any supplies
is down in Fairbanks,

30:52.533 --> 30:54.200
a couple hundred miles
south of here.

30:54.233 --> 30:57.967
So I have to plan carefully
that I get everything I need,

30:58.000 --> 31:01.900
because I sometimes
stay out here for very long
periods of time.

31:01.933 --> 31:05.267
I often ask people,
"What's the longest
you've ever been

31:05.300 --> 31:06.533
"without seeing anybody?"

31:06.567 --> 31:09.933
And a lot of people tell me,
"About 24 hours." (LAUGHING)

31:09.967 --> 31:11.900
Which I find interesting.

31:11.933 --> 31:15.000
This winter I went
four-and-half months
without seeing anybody.

31:15.033 --> 31:18.667
I'm not anti-social,
I'm just anti-cultural.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.867
I don't care
for the way of life

31:20.900 --> 31:23.833
down in modern society,
so I choose to live out here.

31:27.267 --> 31:28.833
Okay, my axe
is all ready to go.

31:28.867 --> 31:30.067
That's my favourite axe,

31:30.100 --> 31:32.333
and I got it all tuned up
just the way I like it.

31:32.367 --> 31:35.233
I'm gonna go back out
and chop some more wood.

31:37.767 --> 31:42.467
NARRATOR: Deep in the Arctic,
living independently
requires knowledge.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.533
A keen understanding
of your environment

31:44.567 --> 31:46.867
is essential
to surviving alone.

31:50.067 --> 31:53.133
For Sue, years of experience
on the tundra,

31:53.167 --> 31:56.300
has helped her develop
unique survival skills.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.167
With nothing but wilderness
surrounding her home,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.100
keeping predators at bay
is key to survival.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.267
I've got inside
of my dwelling going,

32:06.300 --> 32:08.067
protection-wise and security,

32:08.100 --> 32:10.167
now I need
to secure the exterior.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.567
NARRATOR: With nothing
but wilderness

32:11.600 --> 32:14.300
surrounding her home
for many miles,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.333
Sue has to keep
away the predators

32:16.367 --> 32:18.633
by any means necessary.

32:18.667 --> 32:22.933
Bears, all your predators,
keen sense of smell,

32:22.967 --> 32:24.667
I use my leftover
coffee grounds,

32:24.700 --> 32:27.033
get repurposed
and sprinkled out.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.633
Even knowing
there will be more snow

32:29.667 --> 32:32.067
it is such a keen,
strong odour

32:32.100 --> 32:35.800
that it is arming camp
from the outside in.

32:35.833 --> 32:40.433
I've been doing this for years
and years and years now,
and over time,

32:40.467 --> 32:44.500
it is just sort of, like,
you taking your morning coffee

32:44.533 --> 32:48.933
and eggs and bacon,
and going and sitting
in a really ripe outhouse.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.800
Are you going to go,
"Hmm... This is a place
I want to eat."

32:51.833 --> 32:55.233
My concern is, the bears,
they are around.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.767
They've got, you know,
well over 83 tagged

32:59.800 --> 33:02.700
that have the possibility
of walking right through
my camp.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.967
They're up,
they're looking for food,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.100
and I happen to be
the only SOB

33:08.133 --> 33:11.100
that is cooking
in a huge radius.

33:11.133 --> 33:16.300
If you have an animal
that is raging,
charging, fixated,

33:16.333 --> 33:17.667
no, it's not going
to stop them.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.200
But the ones that are
ambling through going,

33:20.233 --> 33:22.167
"Hey, doesn't
that chick live here?

33:22.200 --> 33:23.767
"She'd make a tasty snack."

33:23.800 --> 33:26.000
They get close
and go, "Whoa!"

33:26.033 --> 33:27.533
Burns the heck
out of their noses

33:27.567 --> 33:29.200
and it smells like a sewer,
you know.

33:29.233 --> 33:30.700
"No, I don't
want to go there."

33:32.100 --> 33:35.667
The next thing I do is bleach.

33:35.700 --> 33:40.300
So, with the bleach,
put my thumb over,
this is what I do.

33:41.233 --> 33:42.733
Everything.

33:45.233 --> 33:47.367
Going to get it
little bit heavy here.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.667
Now you can see
this building here,

33:50.700 --> 33:54.667
all these marks are where
I've had to repair it, um...

33:54.700 --> 33:56.200
A bear came through here.

33:56.233 --> 33:58.567
That's a wolverine
on the corner.

33:58.600 --> 34:02.267
So, I just, uh,
try to deter it.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.633
Try to keep that exposure
to a minimum.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.833
I am basically ready
for winter to come knocking.

34:06.867 --> 34:09.733
If a few animals come
knocking at the same time,
I've got it covered.

34:09.767 --> 34:11.167
Two-legged or four-legged,

34:11.200 --> 34:14.567
this chick ain't going
down easy. I'm ready.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.267
NARRATOR: In Noorvik,
Chip and Agnes

34:19.300 --> 34:24.367
use Inupiat knowledge
and traditional skills
to create a seal-skin vest.

34:24.400 --> 34:27.500
Goods created by hand
can be used to barter or sell,

34:27.533 --> 34:30.500
helping maintain the
Hailstones' independent
lifestyle.

34:30.533 --> 34:35.133
Today I have, uh,
four different types
of skin scrapers.

34:35.167 --> 34:37.267
Me, I prefer this one.
This was my mother's,

34:37.300 --> 34:40.867
and we call them itchuun,
which means, uh, skin scraper.

34:42.067 --> 34:43.567
When I was growing up,

34:43.600 --> 34:46.433
there was me
and I had nine sisters,

34:46.467 --> 34:47.733
so we'd always
be around our mom

34:47.767 --> 34:50.000
and she'd always have all
the different kinds of skins

34:50.033 --> 34:53.000
and we'd all sit down and
we'd all learn how to do it.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.567
CHIP: I'm going to put
all this in here.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.900
These are the shavings
from the alder.

35:00.933 --> 35:03.867
And I'm gonna put them
in the water to simmer.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.867
NARRATOR: In order to
preserve and tan the hide,

35:05.900 --> 35:10.633
a solution made of alder bark
is used to dye the seal skin.

35:10.667 --> 35:13.467
At the end, before I do
all my alder dye,

35:13.500 --> 35:17.133
I just sand it up and get
all the rough stuff off.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.800
Hi, girls, sweetie pies.

35:20.833 --> 35:22.967
Why don't you come sit down
and check out what your
mom's up to?

35:23.000 --> 35:27.700
See all these fuzzies,
that's all that needs to come
off and then we'll move on

35:27.733 --> 35:30.267
to dyeing it.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.700
For me, it's real important

35:31.733 --> 35:35.900
that the girls,
all five girls, get to know

35:35.933 --> 35:38.333
all the
traditional things I do.

35:38.367 --> 35:40.800
Sometimes, this environment
is real harsh,

35:40.833 --> 35:43.400
and the more
the girls get involved

35:43.433 --> 35:45.833
in hands-on,
the more they'll know.

35:45.867 --> 35:48.800
-I have the dye.
-Yay. Turned out good?

35:48.833 --> 35:51.133
-It turned out like it should.
-Can I put my hands on that?

35:51.167 --> 35:53.167
Oh, like those willows
you always used, Daddy?

35:53.200 --> 35:55.067
-Yeah, these are alders.
-Alders.

35:55.100 --> 35:56.433
Yep, those are
the willows I used.

35:56.467 --> 35:58.000
I put these in, then I brought
the water to a boil,

35:58.033 --> 35:59.500
and then I set it to simmer.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.800
You use this
and keep them back.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.767
I gotta see
what I'm doing though.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.567
You don't want to make
it too wet,

36:10.600 --> 36:13.333
and you don't want to try to
get the dye on this side.

36:13.367 --> 36:16.667
You just wanna try to
put it all over the top.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.100
There's all kinds
of different things

36:19.133 --> 36:21.367
that they need
to learn to survive

36:21.400 --> 36:23.200
and to pass down to their kids

36:23.233 --> 36:26.633
and try to keep it in our
Inupiat traditional manner.

36:26.667 --> 36:30.000
It's something that you have
to be involved in because

36:30.033 --> 36:31.867
it's always doing something.
(CHUCKLES)

36:31.900 --> 36:33.833
-It's living.
-Yeah, it's living.

36:33.867 --> 36:35.767
There you go.
That's how you do it.

36:35.800 --> 36:39.567
If we don't teach our
kids how to utilise the
materials, the animals,

36:39.600 --> 36:42.633
and the other things around
here to heat themselves,
shelter themselves,

36:42.667 --> 36:44.300
clothe themselves,
and make money,

36:44.333 --> 36:45.833
they're not gonna survive
very well.

36:45.867 --> 36:48.200
Looks like it's got
an even coat all over

36:48.233 --> 36:52.067
and you got the majority
of the little pools picked up.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.400
Good job, girls.

36:53.433 --> 36:54.900
-You girls did real good.
-CHIP: Excellent job.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.300
NARRATOR: For Andy,
years of hunting

36:59.333 --> 37:02.433
have taught him to prepare
for any situation.

37:02.467 --> 37:07.133
Having the tools he needs
is critical if he's to harvest
an elusive animal.

37:08.533 --> 37:11.567
ANDY: We've had a very early
snowfall this year,

37:11.600 --> 37:14.900
and it's really putting a hurt
on the way we do things.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.067
Everything's frozen down.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.333
Everything's buried
under the snow.

37:18.367 --> 37:20.800
I would've liked
to have harvested
a little bit more meat.

37:20.833 --> 37:22.033
Uh, we got a nice moose,

37:22.067 --> 37:24.567
but today,
what's on the agenda

37:24.600 --> 37:26.800
is to go get
a couple beavers.

37:26.833 --> 37:29.300
There's a couple beaver ponds
not too far from here.

37:29.333 --> 37:31.667
And the season's open
for firearm.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.933
Once it cools off
a little bit more,
with this snow,

37:33.967 --> 37:36.400
we'll get a lot of ice forming
on the Yukon pretty quick.

37:36.433 --> 37:39.333
So I want to take full
advantage of being able
to use the boats

37:39.367 --> 37:41.667
before winter
sets in completely.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.733
ANDY: Hunting beaver
is a little bit different

37:47.767 --> 37:50.800
than hunting
a lot of hooved animals.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.667
Beavers have
a pretty good sense of smell.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.867
They tend to come out
in the early mornings
and late evenings.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.667
So I don't know
if they'll be out right now,

37:59.700 --> 38:01.267
but this is close
enough to home.

38:01.300 --> 38:04.767
I can always come back
in the evening time
if I need to.

38:07.733 --> 38:09.933
It's a beaver chew.

38:09.967 --> 38:12.467
It's a lot of aspen and a lot
of cottonwood right here.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.667
So, this is what
they prefer to eat.

38:14.700 --> 38:18.733
You can see there's quite
a few chews around here.

38:35.767 --> 38:37.967
(WHISPERING) I gotta
let him get a little closer
to the shoreline

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
before I take the shot,
so he's not too far out.

38:41.033 --> 38:42.967
This way I can
get him if they sink.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.900
(GUNSHOT)

38:55.967 --> 38:59.633
Don't sink, don't sink,
don't sink, don't sink.

38:59.667 --> 39:02.267
Oh, you son of a bitch. Fuck!

39:04.633 --> 39:06.333
So far, I've never
lost a beaver

39:06.367 --> 39:07.533
hunting them this way.

39:07.567 --> 39:09.900
I don't want this
to be the first.

39:11.633 --> 39:14.033
I'm gonna see if I can't
cast out a few times

39:14.067 --> 39:17.800
and hopefully snag him.

39:17.833 --> 39:20.167
I'll probably end up
snagging a damn branch.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.100
There's an awful
lot of stuff in the river.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.100
I can't stand losing game
when I shoot it.

39:38.633 --> 39:39.733
Just drives me nuts.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.333
It sucks.

39:46.667 --> 39:49.333
Fishing for beavers.
It's a first.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.133
Ooh, there's some bubbles
coming up right there.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.300
This is like
a one-in-a-million chance.

40:08.533 --> 40:11.067
I think I got it. There we go.
I got him.

40:12.167 --> 40:13.700
Son of a bitch.

40:13.733 --> 40:16.200
Oh, is that ever
fucking lucky or what?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.367
Got him.

40:21.733 --> 40:24.200
Ooh, yeah.
Well, he's not that small.

40:27.067 --> 40:28.833
Nice. Nice beaver.

40:32.867 --> 40:34.067
(GRUNTS)

40:34.100 --> 40:36.700
All right, let's head back
to the hacienda.

40:38.567 --> 40:39.600
NARRATOR: Every year,

40:39.633 --> 40:41.200
the Hailstones
head to their camp,

40:41.233 --> 40:43.333
twenty-six miles
west of Noorvik,

40:43.367 --> 40:46.900
where Inupiat knowledge
has been handed down
for generations.

40:46.933 --> 40:49.167
AGNES: We are here
at the lower camp.

40:49.200 --> 40:53.667
This is where we usually come
and put our white fish nets
at this time of the year.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.100
Right now, while
I'm doing the fishing,

40:56.133 --> 40:58.800
Chip's out getting poles,
looking for firewood.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.800
When he comes back
with a load of wood

41:00.833 --> 41:02.533
then he'll put me up
a fish rack.

41:03.933 --> 41:06.200
NARRATOR: In traditional
Inupiat villages,

41:06.233 --> 41:07.800
women are in charge
of the fishing.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.767
That's what needs
to be done...

41:09.800 --> 41:12.600
NARRATOR: It is crucial
that Agnes' daughters
learn the skill,

41:12.633 --> 41:14.767
if they are to survive
this way of life.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.767
Stop with these.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.367
Just watch where you're going!
Watch where you're going.

41:22.400 --> 41:26.800
Got to make it real tight
so the anchor will hook
when I let it go.

41:26.833 --> 41:28.367
Straight there.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.267
And when you let go
of your anchor,

41:31.300 --> 41:32.700
you make sure
your anchor is like this

41:32.733 --> 41:34.767
and not going to get
caught dropping it.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.267
Let it go.

41:38.067 --> 41:39.533
Oh, yeah.

41:39.567 --> 41:41.300
Watch it sink.

41:43.833 --> 41:45.100
Forward, Didi.

41:46.433 --> 41:48.867
If we make sure our net
is set perfectly,

41:48.900 --> 41:51.700
we'll have more advantage
and more fish.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.500
Stop, Lady Bear. Stop.

41:55.533 --> 41:58.367
Turn it off.
Just turn it completely off.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.433
-Shall I pull up my motor?
-AGNES: Yes.

42:00.467 --> 42:01.667
Watch out for that lever.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.400
That's why we need
you to drive here.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.533
You're strong enough
to pull it up.

42:07.300 --> 42:09.233
-Here.
-No, give me that.

42:12.033 --> 42:14.300
All right, make sure it's not
tangled to the bottom.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.967
Oh! I feel something.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.233
-It's a white fish!
-Yes!

42:19.933 --> 42:21.067
Oh, two of them!

42:22.933 --> 42:25.000
Three of them!

42:25.033 --> 42:26.033
Pike.

42:30.233 --> 42:31.933
Oh, whoa!

42:33.133 --> 42:37.967
Definitely going to need
a real big fish rack.
(LAUGHING)

42:38.000 --> 42:40.967
AGNES: It's real important
for me to teach my girls

42:41.000 --> 42:43.300
all the stuff that I know
or what I've learned

42:43.333 --> 42:45.067
from my parents
and my aunts

42:45.100 --> 42:47.300
or my brothers and sisters.

42:47.333 --> 42:51.333
If they don't get it
from someplace like me
or my husband, um,

42:51.367 --> 42:52.500
they could lose it.

42:52.533 --> 42:55.333
But we're not going
to let that happen.

42:58.067 --> 42:59.733
NARRATOR: In the Alaskan bush,

42:59.767 --> 43:01.767
learning to create
and innovate

43:01.800 --> 43:05.033
is the only hope
against the vast
and desolate landscape.
