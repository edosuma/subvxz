14:33.915 --> 14:36.827
Nothing new.
Just a little claustrophobic.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.618
Shouldn’t you be
taking care of
those other people?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.952
The ones that I hurt?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.216
Everything
checks out okay.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.591
My nose is bleeding.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.307
It's expected,
given the trauma
you've sustained.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.520
That's not expected.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.693
The way things fell,
this support beam

15:10.785 --> 15:12.901
is now holding up
a giant pile of rubble.

15:15.828 --> 15:16.165
We can't lift it
without jeopardizing
everyone down here.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.497
So it's time to
discuss amputation.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.422
No.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.673
Please listen to me.
You've been down here
almost two hours.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.970
By the time they
clear away the rubble...

15:33.057 --> 15:35.093
We're not
cutting off her leg.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.638
You don't have
to rush to this

15:42.275 --> 15:43.765
we're risking
crush syndrome.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.895
HAN NA: What's that?

15:44.986 --> 15:47.022
Your leg isn't getting
enough circulation.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.320
The longer it's pinned,
the more the muscle dies.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.238
So what does that mean,
like a limp?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.065
Dying muscles
release poisons.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.485
We free your leg,
the poisons rush back
into your system.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.786
It could stop your heart.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.080
So could cheeseburgers.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.866
Just get your lazy friends
to start moving that pile.

could possibly set in.

up there by hand.

I can get 10 tons

16:08.634 --> 16:09.965

off in two hours.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.383
Well, you need to try.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.965
It's my leg.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.131
McCREANEY: It's not
just crush syndrome
you got to worry about, okay?

16:16.559 --> 16:17.765
There's gas leaks,
there's fire,

16:17.852 --> 16:19.183
we can never rule out
secondary collapses,

16:19.270 --> 16:20.851
no matter how much
we shore this thing up.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.269
You think chopping off
someone's limb

16:22.356 --> 16:24.347
inside a pile of
dirty rocks is safe?

16:24.442 --> 16:26.057
Sepsis, fat embolism,
hemorrhage...

16:26.152 --> 16:27.483
Those risks are
nothing compared

16:27.570 --> 16:29.356
to the risk
of this thing
coming down again.

Captain, he's a jerk,
but that's what
the patient wants.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.991
Can we please just give it
a couple more hours?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.160
Yeah.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.583

to triage.

You don't need
to thank me.
It just makes sense.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.262
Just promise me
you won't let them
cut off my leg.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.224
I promise.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.475
Does that make
you feel better?

For some reason,
it does.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.027

out of his eyes and nose.

something wrong
before the collapse.

neurological symptoms,

17:37.682 --> 17:39.513
goes systemic,
and DIC causes the bleed.

Except for the part
that there's no fever.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.183
Give us a minute?

26:57.157 --> 26:58.272
I know you're angry,

26:58.367 --> 27:02.451
but please don't
put her life at risk
just to get back at me.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.488
Really? Wow.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.372
So this is
all about you now?

27:07.459 --> 27:10.292
You took her side
against me

27:10.379 --> 27:12.040
right after you heard
about my engagement.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.214
Yeah, that must be it.
It's not that you're
a pathetic narcissist.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.710
I don't love you.

27:17.177 --> 27:21.136
So just accept it and
move on with your life

27:21.223 --> 27:22.759
instead of making
everyone miserable.

27:22.850 --> 27:23.965
That's great.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.141
A life lesson
from a middle-aged
single mom

27:26.228 --> 27:27.513
who's dating
a man-child.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.682
Screw you.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.146
I'm sick of making
excuses for you.

27:32.526 --> 27:35.438
I'm sick of other people
having to tiptoe around you

27:35.529 --> 27:36.689
and make their
own lives worse

27:36.780 --> 27:40.022
while they try to
keep you from collapsing.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.778
I'm done.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.908
Fantastic. Just stay
away from my patient.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.120
What are you
clinging to, House?

27:51.837 --> 27:54.328
You're gonna risk her life
just to save her leg?

27:54.423 --> 27:56.254
It really worked out
well for you, didn't it?

27:57.050 --> 27:59.757
What do you
have in your life?
Honestly, tell me.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.132
I'm moving on.
Wilson is moving on.

28:03.223 --> 28:06.431
And you? You've
got nothing, House.
Nothing.

28:08.312 --> 28:09.597
I'm going down there,

28:09.688 --> 28:12.680
and I'm gonna convince her
to let me cut her leg off.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.937
If you have
any decency left,
you'll stay out of it.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.363
HANNA: No.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.819
(SHUDDERING)

28:26.914 --> 28:28.620
Dr. House promised.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.240
If there was
any other way...

28:31.335 --> 28:33.792
Itdoesnt
hurt right now.
I can wait.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.751
Dr. House,

28:39.635 --> 28:41.000
tell her.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.883
Hanna,

28:49.186 --> 28:50.926
we have to
amputate your leg.

28:51.813 --> 28:55.431
No. You said that
there was time.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.811
There was.
And it's run out.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.854
No.

29:01.949 --> 29:05.362
You asked me how
I had hurt my leg.

29:06.328 --> 29:10.241
I had a blood clot,
and the muscle was dying.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.247
And I had all these
doctors telling me
I should amputate.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.166
And I said no.
And they did this

29:15.963 --> 29:17.328
very risky operation.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.955
I almost died.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.210
But you saved your leg.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.343
I wish I hadn't.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.631
They cut out
a chunk of muscle
about the size of my fist.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.844
They left me
with this mutilated,
useless thing.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.107
And I'm in pain
every day.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.606
And it changed me.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.523
It made me
a harder person.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.736
A worse person.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.538
And now...

29:51.206 --> 29:52.707
Now I'm alone.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.039
You don't wanna
be like me.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.418
You got a husband
who loves you.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.175
You have friends,
you can start a family.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.506
You have a life.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.183
And this is just a leg.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.160
Okay.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.252
(SOFTLY) I got it.

30:58.398 --> 31:02.016
I can't put you out
'cause it could depress
your respiration too much.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.487
This should take away
some of the pain.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.572
Will it be quick?

31:14.956 --> 31:19.416
I'll use the scalpel to
slice through the skin,
muscle and fat.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.828
That should go
pretty fast.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.255
Then I'll switch over
to the electric saw
when I get to the bone.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.421
It's two bones
about as thick
as a broom stick,

31:28.512 --> 31:31.128
and takes about as
long to get through.

31:31.223 --> 31:34.511
I'm gonna cut as close
to the concrete as I can.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.466
Save as much of
your limb as possible.

31:37.104 --> 31:38.219
Then the orthopedic
surgeons

31:38.313 --> 31:39.553
back at the hospital
will clean you up,

31:39.648 --> 31:41.388
have you fitted
for a prosthetic.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.691
You'll be running circles
around me in no time.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.063
(LAUGHS)

31:51.451 --> 31:53.316
HOW bad Will it hurt?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.863

What are his vita/s?

34:47.460 --> 34:48.666
Excuse me, Officer.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.952
What do you mean
"Officer"?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.503
How long has there
been a cop there?

34:52.966 --> 34:53.955
I don't know,
10 minutes.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.086
He was being questioned
when he fell into the coma.

34:56.177 --> 34:59.465
Was anything else making
him nervous or worried
before his other symptoms?

34:59.556 --> 35:01.262
He was claustrophobic
right before the bleed.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.431
And before the fever,
we told him

35:03.518 --> 35:05.099
that he probably
did fall asleep.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.517
HOUSE: It’s his BP spiking.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.016
But that didn't cause
his first symptom.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.020
Yeah, it did.
All the caffeine.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.725
We thought the problem
was in his toilet,

35:13.820 --> 35:15.151
and by that, of course,
I mean his head,

35:15.697 --> 35:17.187
which distracted us
from the fact that

35:17.282 --> 35:19.147
it could’ve been just
a clog in his sewer pipe,

35:19.242 --> 35:21.574
and by that, of course,
/ mean his spinal cord
and...

35:22.037 --> 35:23.698
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
You get the idea.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.739
An arachnoid cyst
on his lower spine,
that's why we missed it.

It's not a clot.
