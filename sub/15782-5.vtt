00:11.677 --> 00:13.679
My dear?

00:13.763 --> 00:15.473
To us!

00:15.556 --> 00:17.767
[ Scoffs ]
Couldn't have asked for a bigger target.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.477
Hey, why don't you give me
a hard one?

00:19.560 --> 00:21.145
Is that an invitation?

00:21.229 --> 00:22.897
Orders are we take him
alive, Headshot.

00:22.980 --> 00:24.315
Monstroso's got intel
we need.

00:24.398 --> 00:25.775
Uh, well, what about
Hit Girl there?

00:25.858 --> 00:27.610
No!
We need her alive, too.

00:27.693 --> 00:29.195
Why? So you can
screw it up

00:29.278 --> 00:31.072
and lose her
all over again, Samson?

00:31.155 --> 00:33.324
- Hey, screw you, Headshot!
- Not even with his dick.

00:33.407 --> 00:35.701
S'matter, Samson?
You still sweet on her?

00:35.785 --> 00:37.370
Don't taunt him, babe.

00:37.453 --> 00:40.206
Brock could never love such
an awful, lying bitch person.

00:40.289 --> 00:42.166
Babe, what have
I told you?

00:42.250 --> 00:44.001
No touching while I'm aiming.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.628
Gonna be okay, sport?

00:45.711 --> 00:47.630
Can't be easy for you to see
Molostro again.

00:47.713 --> 00:49.173
I'm fine.
"Molostro?"

00:49.257 --> 00:51.342
Yeah, it's my celebrity
couple name for them.

00:51.425 --> 00:53.886
Or do you like "Monstrotov"
better?

00:53.970 --> 00:56.722
All right, Sky Pilot.
Let them know we're here.

01:00.726 --> 01:03.646
We seem to have
uninvited guests.

01:03.729 --> 01:05.898
Shall I...
show them out?

01:05.982 --> 01:07.441
No, my dear.

01:07.525 --> 01:11.696
Come.
Let's give them a show.

01:11.779 --> 01:13.781
BROCK:
Aaaaaarrghhh!

01:15.741 --> 01:18.077
So, finally caught
The Big Bad Wolf

01:18.160 --> 01:19.870
and Little Red Killing Hood.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.831
Well, whoop-de-freakin'-doo!

01:21.914 --> 01:23.791
Bet you're real proud
of yourself.

01:23.874 --> 01:25.209
All in a day's work.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.877
Work!
ls that what you call it?

01:26.961 --> 01:29.297
More honest work than
whatever the hell you gestapo

01:29.380 --> 01:31.799
federale I.A. Suit
jockeys do for a living!

01:31.882 --> 01:33.676
Uh, okay.
Ah, just take it easy.

01:33.759 --> 01:35.344
We're just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.971
Well, then you're asking
the wrong guy,

01:37.054 --> 01:38.556
because I am clearly
a top!

01:38.639 --> 01:40.224
Oh, a smart guy, huh?

01:40.308 --> 01:42.226
All right, Einstein!
Do the math on this one --

01:42.310 --> 01:45.730
how does on skinny redhead take
down an army of super agents

01:45.813 --> 01:48.357
and a hundred-billion-dollar
hover-fortress?!

01:48.441 --> 01:52.153
And how in the hell
do you lose a 12-foot man?!

01:52.236 --> 01:55.531
Well [ exhales ]...
it wasn't easy.

02:00.077 --> 02:01.746
BROCK: [sighs]
What a friggin' mess.

02:01.829 --> 02:03.748
It's about to get
a whole lot messier.

02:03.831 --> 02:05.583
Washington's sending
new misters up our ass.

02:05.666 --> 02:07.376
BROCK:
So what are we gonna tell them?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.044
GATHERS:
As little as possible.

02:09.127 --> 02:10.253
After Cardholder and Doe?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.256
I don't trust any of these
Mister Branch bastards.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.967
Evening, General Gathers.
My name's Mr. Frost.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.054
These are my associates,
Mr. Sample, and Master --

02:18.137 --> 02:19.263
Master Yourname, sir.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.391
Uh, it's an honor to meet you,
and“.okay.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.560
Have to excuse the rookie.
Still in training.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.021
He ain't a full mister yet --
hasn't earned his hat.

02:27.104 --> 02:29.023
You know why we're here,
Gathers.

02:29.106 --> 02:30.900
Washington wants
a full report

02:30.983 --> 02:32.943
on this colossal
cluster-fudge.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.613
We're gonna want to interview
all the key players.

02:35.696 --> 02:38.282
Hmph! Fine!
Do your worst, you vultures!

02:38.366 --> 02:39.283
GATHERS:
We've got nothing to hide.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.869
SAMPLE:
All right. Let's start from the beginning.

02:41.952 --> 02:43.704
<i>GATHERS:
All right. First of all,</i>

02:43.788 --> 02:46.123
<i>I want it on the record
that this operation</i>

02:46.207 --> 02:48.334
<i>was a complete success.</i>

02:48.417 --> 02:50.002
<i>We achieved our objective
with limited resistance</i>

02:50.086 --> 02:52.588
<i>and zero casualties
on our side.</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:56.133
BROCK: <i>The packages Were secured
and blindfolded for delivery.</i>

02:56.217 --> 02:58.803
<i>We followed every security protocol.</i>

02:58.886 --> 03:00.346
<i>FROST:
Every protocol?</i>

03:00.429 --> 03:03.766
Were you aware there were
uncleared civilians on board?

03:03.849 --> 03:06.477
Was that the X-1 we passed
on deck on our way in?

03:06.560 --> 03:07.978
Not at that time. No.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.356
What the hell were they doing
there in the first place?

03:10.439 --> 03:12.608
Well, I-I came for these.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.612
So... you came to get
a boob job?

03:16.696 --> 03:20.366
No, sir. These 48 triple-D's
are 100% natural.

03:20.449 --> 03:23.119
Two big, pillowy gifts from
god, man, and super-science,

03:23.202 --> 03:24.912
and he wanted to get
rid of them!

03:24.995 --> 03:27.790
The Ventures here tagged
along for moral support.

03:27.873 --> 03:29.333
Jonas Venture's brat?

03:29.417 --> 03:31.585
Why the hell are you still
wasting O.S.I. resources

03:31.669 --> 03:33.379
protecting that hump?
- Hey!

03:33.462 --> 03:35.548
Why do you think I'd put
a washout like Hatred on him?

03:35.631 --> 03:37.383
Hey! I'm only human!

03:37.466 --> 03:39.677
I get these urges, you see?

03:39.760 --> 03:41.512
And they got me on this
special medicine

03:41.595 --> 03:43.681
to take the edge off
them, and uh...

03:43.764 --> 03:45.933
I'll have to run
more tests to be certain,

03:46.016 --> 03:49.228
but it's highly probable
the Nomolestol we put you on

03:49.311 --> 03:50.855
is having an adverse
interaction

03:50.938 --> 03:54.275
with the super-soldier serum
you received back in '88.

03:54.358 --> 03:56.527
Super-soldier?
Him? Ha!

03:56.610 --> 03:58.529
Hey, now!
I keep a straight face

03:58.612 --> 04:00.948
every time you call yourself
a "super-scientist."

04:01.031 --> 04:03.534
Well, frankly, I'm more
concerned about the boy here.

04:03.617 --> 04:05.369
You been dipping into
Agent Hatred's meds, son?

04:05.453 --> 04:06.954
What? These?

04:07.037 --> 04:09.373
Nah, they're just falsies
built into the suit.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.125
Do you have any meds
you could put him on?

04:11.208 --> 04:12.793
He's been wearing that thing
for weeks.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.462
He was the same way
with the Batman costume

04:14.545 --> 04:16.130
I bought him when he was 10.

04:16.213 --> 04:18.423
Yeah, only now he doesn't die
when he jumps off the roof.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.091
No man can fight
his destiny.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.761
Yeah, or your
stench.

to stink in there, Hank.

nothing to do with this.</i>

on board for too long,</i>

<i>so I wanted to start
the debriefing.</i>

04:33.981 --> 04:35.691
<i>But there was a holdup.</i>

04:35.775 --> 04:37.401
Wait, wait, wait.
They held you up?

04:37.485 --> 04:38.444
So that's when they escaped?

04:38.527 --> 04:40.446
No, man.
That's a figure of speech.

04:40.529 --> 04:41.989
Are you done with him yet?

04:42.072 --> 04:43.783
[squishing ] Not yet, sir.
I'll let you know.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.117
You'll let me know.

04:46.952 --> 04:48.579
Dude, look at the size
of this guy.

04:48.662 --> 04:51.916
Will you just let me

first meet?</i>

She was a gymnast.</i>

<i>See, we had intel
that the Siberian Husky</i>

05:07.848 --> 05:09.475

to strike there.</i>

05:09.558 --> 05:10.935
Sorry. Uh, Siberian...

05:11.018 --> 05:12.937
Husky!
Learn your history, man.

05:13.020 --> 05:14.939
He was the KGB's
deadliest assassin.

05:15.022 --> 05:17.274
<i>Guy was a living legend.</i>

05:17.358 --> 05:19.735
<i>I should have paid more
attention.</i>

05:19.819 --> 05:22.613
<i>I was... distracted.</i>

05:22.696 --> 05:24.615
<i>What do you expect?
I was a rookie agent</i>

05:24.698 --> 05:25.950
<i>on my first
major assignment.</i>

at the time was...</i>

05:30.746 --> 05:33.499
<i>so was she.</i>

05:33.582 --> 05:35.793
<i>And her father
had trained her well.</i>

05:35.876 --> 05:37.044
[spectators screaming ]

05:37.127 --> 05:39.588
FROST:
Touching. Real touching.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.049
So this dizzy dame's been
screwing up your noodle

05:42.132 --> 05:44.051
since the first day
you laid eyes on her.

05:44.134 --> 05:45.761
What are you getting at?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.721
What's the real nature
of your relationship

05:47.805 --> 05:50.599
with Molotov Cocktease,
Agent Samson?

05:50.683 --> 05:51.934
Strictly professional.

05:52.017 --> 05:53.686
Well, sure, we flirted
a little bit,

05:53.769 --> 05:56.272
but what do you expect?
She was the babysitter.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.148
More like your partner!

05:58.232 --> 06:01.193
Or was she your lover?
- I was undercover!

06:01.277 --> 06:03.529
I was infiltrating
her all-lady kill cadre.

06:03.612 --> 06:05.364
Listen to me
very carefully --

06:05.447 --> 06:08.617
I did not have sex
with that woman!

06:08.701 --> 06:10.619
So that's why cut
your pud off

06:10.703 --> 06:12.621
and got yourself a pair
of boobs, eh?

06:12.705 --> 06:15.165
No, no. Not exactly.
But, uh, they came in handy.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.585
Also saw a noticeable
improvement in my tips.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.087
No! Not even the tip!
Look, I'm telling ya!

06:20.170 --> 06:23.799
She wore this belt kind of thing
like a -- like a --

06:23.883 --> 06:25.009
A stripper?!

06:25.092 --> 06:26.969
Exotic dancer,
you misogynist!

06:27.052 --> 06:28.345
You mean like the one
we found

06:28.429 --> 06:29.972
when we tossed
your barracks?

06:30.055 --> 06:31.974
That -- I, uh -- I was
gonna file that.

06:32.057 --> 06:33.642
That's, uh... evidence.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.644
Of what? Your schoolboy
crush on this chippy?

06:35.728 --> 06:36.854
Admit it, Samson.

06:36.937 --> 06:38.772
You're the one who busted her
out, aren't ya?

06:38.856 --> 06:39.982
No! That's bullshit!

06:40.065 --> 06:42.651
Then account for your
whereabouts when she escaped.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.446
Right here!
Right where you're sittin'.

06:45.529 --> 06:47.114
Well, sorry
about the getup.

06:47.197 --> 06:50.409
Didn't have any jumpsuits
in size "stupid big."

06:50.492 --> 06:52.411
You could at least have
laundered them.

06:52.494 --> 06:54.705
Oh, yeah, that rookie's
a bit of a bed wetter.

06:54.788 --> 06:56.957
I'll have the gals
in the uniform department

06:57.041 --> 06:59.710
get right to work
on something more suitable.

06:59.793 --> 07:02.880
You needn't bother.
I shan't be staying long.

07:02.963 --> 07:06.800
FROST: So he told you, to your face,
he was planning to escape?

07:06.884 --> 07:09.553
No, he told me he was
as good as dead already --

07:09.637 --> 07:11.597
that the Guild would be
coming for him.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.767
Said he was willing to tell me
anything I wanted to know.

07:14.850 --> 07:16.393
And what do you want
in return?

07:16.477 --> 07:19.605
I suppose a conjugal visit
is out of the question?

07:19.688 --> 07:22.024
[ Sighs ]
Let's start with the Sovereign.

07:22.107 --> 07:24.026
Mr. Bowie lives
in New York City.

07:24.109 --> 07:26.028
Why don't you go there
and ask him yourself?

07:26.111 --> 07:27.780
You and I both know

07:27.863 --> 07:29.782
the Sovereign's
not really Bowie.

07:29.865 --> 07:32.952
I met 'em both, and the real
Bowie can't turn into a hawk.

07:33.035 --> 07:33.953
So who is he?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.704
The man now known
as the Sovereign

07:35.788 --> 07:38.374
was once just a petty
super criminal,

07:38.457 --> 07:40.709
a talented but down-on-his-luck
shapeshifter.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.087
He and the real Bowie
met in '72.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.631
Rumor has it the creature
on the cover of Diamond Dogs

07:45.714 --> 07:48.634
is actually an unaltered photo
of the Sovereign.

07:48.717 --> 07:50.719
So, he just gave you
all of this?

07:50.803 --> 07:51.804
That and more.

07:51.887 --> 07:53.806
He may also have been
the woman beside Bowie

07:53.889 --> 07:55.641
on the cover of Pin-Ups.

07:55.724 --> 07:58.686
But you're asking the wrong
questions, Agent Samson.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.521
If you really want to take down
the Guild,

08:00.604 --> 08:02.690
you should start with
The Council.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.817
- FROST: "The Council"?
- Of 13, yeah.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.820
Monstroso said the Guild is
actually ruled by a committee.

08:07.903 --> 08:09.655
Said if we checked the miniature
secret camera

08:09.738 --> 08:12.616
in the pinky ring
we confiscated from him,

08:12.700 --> 08:13.784
we'd find pictures of 'em.

08:13.867 --> 08:15.619
- Did ya?
- Sort of.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.454
They meet
only via tele-screen

08:17.538 --> 08:19.999
to protect their anonymity,
even from each other.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.459
These were taken at one
such meeting.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.211
Recognize
any of the voices?

08:24.294 --> 08:26.922
Only one. Councilman 4.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.924
His shrill chuckle
and ludicrous habit

08:29.008 --> 08:30.968
of punctuating his statements
with a bicycle horn

08:31.051 --> 08:33.220
gave him away
as The Clue Clown.

08:33.303 --> 08:35.722
[alarm blaring ]

08:36.724 --> 08:38.683
Excuse me a sec.

08:38.767 --> 08:41.352
- Talk to me.
- Hey, I'm not a bed wetter.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.105
Whatever, Puddles.
What's going on?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.565
Molotov escaped!

08:44.648 --> 08:47.234
See, I'm not your man.
I didn't break Molotov out.

08:47.317 --> 08:48.652
AMBER:
It was me.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.654
If you're looking for someone
to blame, blame me.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.364
I was the one guarding her.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.324
There, there, hon.
Let it out.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.326
I-I followed
all the procedures.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.913
I gave her a full nozzle scan
and everything.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.708
But I must've missed
something.

09:02.791 --> 09:04.668
I was the one
who sounded the alarm.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.254
So, uh, you might want
to write that down.

09:07.337 --> 09:10.007
<i>Amber and I were supposed
to take the jump jet to Napa</i>

09:10.090 --> 09:11.592
<i>on a weekend pass.</i>

09:11.675 --> 09:13.594
<i>You know how
air traffic to the coast can be</i>

09:13.677 --> 09:16.138
On a Friday night,
so I went to check on her.

09:16.221 --> 09:21.143
And that's when I uncovered
her deadly deception.

09:21.226 --> 09:23.520
Amber!
You're not a real blonde!

09:23.604 --> 09:25.856
But I am!
See? This is blonde!

09:25.939 --> 09:27.858
Maybe not gold,
but it wouldn't do

09:27.941 --> 09:29.860
to go around calling myself
"Amber Dishwater,"

09:29.943 --> 09:31.278
now, would it?

09:31.361 --> 09:32.780
What else are you
lying about?

09:32.863 --> 09:35.741
Hey, hey! I'll ask the
questions here, pretty boy.

09:35.824 --> 09:37.910
DEAN:
All right! I admit it!

09:37.993 --> 09:42.039
I did it!
Just me. No one else.

09:42.122 --> 09:44.708
I let them out.
Both of them.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.418
And I am not sorry.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.880
FROST:
All right, kid.

09:49.963 --> 09:52.174
You got your pop.
Now spill.

09:52.257 --> 09:54.176
It's okay, sweetie.
Just tell the man the truth.

09:54.259 --> 09:56.011
It was earlier today.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.263
While Mr. Hatred was getting
his booby tests,

09:58.347 --> 10:01.350
my dad dragged me along
on his nostalgia trip.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.894
My dad got me
the internship, of course.

10:03.977 --> 10:06.980
I was, uh, just about your
age at the time, and --

10:07.064 --> 10:10.067
Ahh. Here it is!
Good old Number 5,

10:10.150 --> 10:12.277
my lab away from lab.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.029
[ Cooing ]

10:14.113 --> 10:16.865
This, uh...
that wasn't here then.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.909
Hey!
You not supposed be in here!

10:18.992 --> 10:21.787
It's cool.
Got my backstage pass.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.872
Yeah, fellow super-scientist.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.624
Oh, you Dr. Venture.

10:25.707 --> 10:27.626
Ah, you know
my work?

10:27.709 --> 10:28.669
No, I used to live
in your backyard

10:28.752 --> 10:30.295
with those SPHINX guys,
though.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.089
Listen, you gotta go --
I gotta keep these primos

10:32.172 --> 10:33.799
in complete isolation
at all time.

10:33.882 --> 10:36.385
- "Primos"?
- Yes. Short for "premonition."

10:36.468 --> 10:38.846
Yeah, they're all psychic
and stuff, you know?

10:38.929 --> 10:41.223
[grunts]

10:41.306 --> 10:43.142
Ah, that one pooped.
It just pooped.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.435
No,no,no.
He's having a premonition!

10:45.519 --> 10:47.354
You're very lucky
to witness one of these.

10:47.437 --> 10:50.232
Take a look.
- Uh... thank you, no.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.900
Oh, false alarm.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.569
You know, like,
when you have a dream,

10:53.652 --> 10:55.571
and in that dream you get,
like, a really good idea?

10:55.654 --> 10:57.656
So you wake up,
and you write it down,

10:57.739 --> 11:00.284
and when you read it
later on, you look at it,

11:00.367 --> 11:02.452
and it's just a bunch
of bullshit.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.121
That's kind of what
they do a lot.

11:04.204 --> 11:05.956
So they just live in
these tanks?

11:06.039 --> 11:07.499
Do you ever let them out?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.585
[alarm blares]
DEAN: <i>I don't know.</i>

11:09.668 --> 11:11.920
<i>I-I felt a-a connection
with them.</i>

11:12.004 --> 11:14.256
<i>I could tell they didn't
want to be there.</i>

11:14.339 --> 11:15.883
<i>So when that alarm
went off,</i>

11:15.966 --> 11:17.843
I took advantage
of the confusion,

11:17.926 --> 11:19.136
and I set them free.

11:19.219 --> 11:22.389
Well, thanks for completely
wasting our time, kid.

11:22.472 --> 11:25.100
- Sorry, sir, I --
- Not you. Him.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.727
Now get back to work!

11:26.810 --> 11:29.646
Call us when you got something
that isn't completely fruity!

11:29.730 --> 11:32.983
Hellooooo, Sailor Boy!

11:33.066 --> 11:34.610
I know you're busy
making the world safe

11:34.693 --> 11:36.904
for democracy or whatever,
but I wanted to give you

11:36.987 --> 11:39.031
something special
for our anniversary.

11:39.114 --> 11:41.283
Mmm, hello, Sugarpop!
Hang on. Let me get ready.

11:41.366 --> 11:43.827
<i>- ALCHEMIST: I'm Waiting!
- Whoa, whoa, Whoa, Whoa./</i>

11:43.911 --> 11:46.163
T.M.I.!
Just stop already, please!

11:46.246 --> 11:48.332
Don't you guys always say,
"anything you can remember,

11:48.415 --> 11:50.667
no matter how inconsequential,
could be useful"?

11:50.751 --> 11:53.086
I, uh -- yeah, but let's
just skip ahead.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.838
[shudders]
- Ugh, fine.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.132
I got off, the alarm went off,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.884
Hunter called a meeting.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.844
Your target is equally
skilled in firearms,

12:00.928 --> 12:03.513
bladed weapons,
and hand-to-hand ass-kicking!

12:03.597 --> 12:05.265
She's also a master of disguise,

12:05.349 --> 12:07.643
and right now, she could be
anywhere on this ship...

12:07.726 --> 12:10.020
or anyone.

12:10.103 --> 12:12.022
Ow! Ow!
Damn it, Shore Leave! Ow!

12:12.105 --> 12:13.899
Shit!
Sorry, Afterburner.

12:13.982 --> 12:15.442
With the helmet and, uh --
I thought you might be --

12:15.525 --> 12:17.444
Thought I might be what?
A guy who's a little

12:17.527 --> 12:19.446
embarrassed about
his horrible scars, maybe?

12:19.529 --> 12:21.198
All right! Cut the chatter!

12:21.281 --> 12:22.866
She was last seen
on level "C, "

12:22.950 --> 12:24.326
so get down there
on the double!

12:24.409 --> 12:27.204
- Yo-S-I!
- Go-S-I!

12:27.287 --> 12:28.914
Go! Go, man!
- Where do you want me?

12:28.997 --> 12:30.874
Out of my hair,
what's left of it.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.459
Hatred, get these clowns
downstairs

12:32.542 --> 12:34.002
And lock 'em
someplace safe, will ya?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.879
Look, can't we
just go?

12:35.963 --> 12:37.339
My plane is right outside.

12:37.422 --> 12:39.466
Lockdown means locked down!

12:39.549 --> 12:42.052
Airport's snowed in, okay?
Now scram!

12:42.135 --> 12:44.054
Come on!
Put me in, coach!

12:44.137 --> 12:46.056
Don't you have, like,
an Avengers department?

12:46.139 --> 12:48.058
Maybe you could use
an Iron Man type?

12:48.141 --> 12:49.685
Or an Iron Woman?

12:49.768 --> 12:51.895
Hatred, I swear to God!
- FROST: <i>What the hell</i>

12:51.979 --> 12:54.481
<i>does any of this have to do
with Monstroso?</i>

12:54.564 --> 12:56.942
I was gettin' to that.
Hunter'd ordered me to stay here

12:57.025 --> 12:59.236
in case Molotov tried
to spring him.

12:59.319 --> 13:01.321
So I kept up
the interrogation.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.323
All right, what can you
tell me about the investors?

13:03.407 --> 13:04.574
Who are they?

13:04.658 --> 13:07.244
What's their connection
to the Guild?

13:07.327 --> 13:10.706
But he didn't like my line
of questioning too much.

Yeah, that was kind
of my bad.

13:47.701 --> 13:51.580
I led the team down to "C"
like Hunter said.

13:51.663 --> 13:53.123
Unless it's Chinese
New Year,

13:53.206 --> 13:54.958

this way.

All right, Shuttle-Cock,

13:57.085 --> 14:00.213

- There she is!

Nobody sticks Hank
in the corner!

It's a round room, Hank.
There aren't any corners.

Shut up, know-it-all!
And you shut up, too!

15:39.688 --> 15:41.064
Okay, I'm up!

15:41.148 --> 15:42.858
But you didn't keep them
safe, did you?

15:42.941 --> 15:44.818
Dr. Venture, are you
ready to tell me

15:44.901 --> 15:46.987
what happened to your
other son?

15:47.070 --> 15:50.073
Uh, Hunk? Is it Hunk?
- Hank.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.075
And no, I can't talk
about that.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.077
I was napping at the time.

15:54.161 --> 15:58.081
Hank sometimes gets these
notions in his noggin,

15:58.165 --> 15:59.541

stoppin' him.

15:59.624 --> 16:02.335

guys couldn't stop her, huh?

Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no!

given to me.

16:17.517 --> 16:21.313

just stay here, will ya?

All right, super-kill-lady!

16:46.838 --> 16:49.299
I am officially over my crush
on you!

a minute earlier,

I could've saved him!

16:58.683 --> 17:02.896
Instead, I had to find him
like that.

Hank, are you okay?

17:11.112 --> 17:13.448
Oh, god, Hank.
What did she do to you?

17:13.531 --> 17:16.660
She -- she stole
my destiny.

She's got Hank's
strength suit.

giving dynamite to a grendel!

17:21.705 --> 17:23.333
Get in there, Samson!

She just opened the hangar
doors!

17:25.292 --> 17:27.378
Go get her, son!
I'm right behind you!

All right, Mol.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.973
It's just you and me now.
Again.

17:38.056 --> 17:41.226
Is that what you wanted?

17:41.309 --> 17:43.311
[grunts]

17:55.574 --> 17:57.158
Dammit!

18:02.289 --> 18:03.832
Come on.

18:03.915 --> 18:05.375
Come on!

18:05.458 --> 18:07.877
<i>Shh.
- FROST: You fell off?!</i>

18:07.961 --> 18:09.671
How the hell are you still
breathin' oxygen?

18:09.754 --> 18:11.548
Friends in high
places.

18:11.631 --> 18:14.050
Aaaaaaaaah!

18:14.134 --> 18:16.219
[thud]

18:16.303 --> 18:17.679
Beep-be-beep!

18:17.762 --> 18:19.723
FROST: <i>Oh, come on!
That's impossible!</i>

18:19.806 --> 18:21.558
<i>What are you,
a friggin' superhero?</i>

18:21.641 --> 18:23.268
<i>BROCK:
It's all part of the job, man.</i>

18:23.351 --> 18:25.020
<i>Plus I was pissed.</i>

18:25.103 --> 18:27.522
<i>I knew the only way to
end this was to take her out,</i>

18:27.606 --> 18:30.150
<i>once and for all.</i>

18:41.911 --> 18:43.288
Hiya, Mol.

18:43.371 --> 18:44.914
Samson.

18:44.998 --> 18:48.084
I was wondering when
you'd show up to the party.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.337
I was getting sick of talking
to your friends.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.422
I thought you came
with a date.

18:52.505 --> 18:56.426
Meh.
He's not as much fun as you.

18:56.509 --> 18:58.428
Then let's dance.

18:58.511 --> 19:01.264
Ooh. What? Did Joe Eszterhas
write that for you?

19:01.348 --> 19:02.932
What happened next?

19:03.016 --> 19:05.310
We made out like
Spider-Man and Mary Jane.

19:05.393 --> 19:08.146
What do you think happened?
You saw the video.

19:08.229 --> 19:11.608
I... did... my... duty.

19:11.691 --> 19:13.526
- I found them!
- Oh, thank God.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.445
They're on the portside,
outboard number two!

19:15.528 --> 19:17.781
Get me eyes!
- I've got video up!

19:40.887 --> 19:43.556
Eh, here ya go, kid.
You've earned it.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.142
Aw, gosh.
Really, you guys?

19:46.226 --> 19:47.310
We'll be taking our report

19:47.394 --> 19:49.479
back to headquarters now,
Gathers.

19:49.562 --> 19:52.524
I got to tell you, it don't
paint a pretty picture.

19:52.607 --> 19:55.026
Men with tits?
Pederasts on the payroll?

19:55.110 --> 19:56.695
This ain't gonna fly.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.697
You run a weird ship,
General.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.240
We'll be watching you.

20:00.323 --> 20:03.201
Eh, don't let the door shoosh
you in the ass on the way out.

20:03.284 --> 20:05.286
Oh, uh, bye.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.465
GATHERS:
Samson! Stand down!

20:17.549 --> 20:19.342
She's with us.
- What?

20:19.426 --> 20:21.219
This wasn't an escape.
It was a test.

20:21.302 --> 20:23.179
Our security and her skills.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.931
We failed. She passed.

20:25.014 --> 20:26.349
What?
She killed all those agents!

20:26.433 --> 20:28.101
You mean all those
double agents.

20:28.184 --> 20:29.811
Traitors, every last
one of them!

20:29.894 --> 20:31.813
I gave Red here a list
of chores,

20:31.896 --> 20:33.648
and she took out
the garbage.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.358
- What?! Are you nuts?!
- Sometimes. Not today.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.361
We need a deep-cover
infiltrator on the team,

20:38.445 --> 20:39.696
someone to work in
the shadows,

20:39.779 --> 20:41.406
out from under the prying eyes

20:41.489 --> 20:43.408
of the bureaucrats
and the misters,

20:43.491 --> 20:44.951
someone the enemy would
never suspect.

20:45.034 --> 20:47.829
What? You can't trust her!
She is the enemy!

20:47.912 --> 20:49.497
She's a mercenary, Samson.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.166
People who hired her all these
years were the enemy.

20:51.249 --> 20:53.418
Long as we pay better,
she's on our side.

20:53.501 --> 20:55.879
Welcome to the team,
Agent Cocktease!

20:55.962 --> 20:58.506
We'll, uh, have to talk
about that name later.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.216
- I found them!
- Oh, thank God.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.218
They're on the portside,
outboard number two!

21:02.302 --> 21:05.930
Get me eyes!
- I've got video up!

21:17.025 --> 21:20.236
[sighs ] So, where the hell
did Monstroso go?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.030
Damned if I know.

21:22.113 --> 21:23.782
What?
Did you forget something?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.742
Evening, General Gathers.
My name is Mr. Frost.

21:25.825 --> 21:28.620
This is my associate,
Mr. Sample.

21:28.703 --> 21:30.955
Headquarters sent us to
investigate this, uh,

21:31.039 --> 21:33.875
Molostro incident.

21:44.844 --> 21:47.847
[ Up-tempo music plays]

22:12.705 --> 22:14.624
MAN:
You should be just fine, son,

22:14.707 --> 22:16.626
once your atrophied limbs
get strong enough

22:16.709 --> 22:18.461
to stand
without the suit.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.755
But you'll never get
over the loss of your breasts.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.924
You'll miss them forever.
