WEBVTT

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:08.730
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:10.023
Got a second?

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.024
Sure.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.025
Wow.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.694
Yeah, could be our fall line.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.029
If you think they're any good.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.405
No, I think they're great.

01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:18.656
Okay, so we should commit.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.825
You should commit to them.

01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:24.037
Remember how
I decided that I wanted to leave

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.039
the store,
and then I changed my mind?

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:29.500
Well, I've decided that I want
to leave the store again.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:30.877
Oh.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.879
If you're still okay with it.

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:35.715
Yeah, of course I am.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:38.885
I mean, obviously
I'm a little scared

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.928
and a bit sad, but if it's what
you want to do,

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.055
I think you should do it.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.098
You have nothing
to be scared about.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:45.391
Oh, right.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.436
Do you remember how terrified
I was about opening the store?

01:00:48.519 --> 01:00:50.980
I mean, you had
to find the location

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.398
and negotiate the whole lease.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.900
With the help of a cute attorney

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.360
who happened to have
an office upstairs.

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.070
Oh, yeah, wh-what was his name?

01:00:57.862 --> 01:00:58.821
Look at this way:

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:00.782
you got a successful business
out of the deal;

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:02.283
I got a future husband.

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:03.785
Sounds fair.

01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:07.413
We've just always had something
binding us together.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.541
School and the apartment,
the store.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.586
Is this where we pledge
our eternal friendship

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:15.963
to each other and have
a pinkie swear or something?

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:19.050
Would, um, a quart of fudge
ripple and a sappy movie do?

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:19.967
Yeah.

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:30.770
I know this sounds weird...

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.855
but I kind of miss you already.

01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:43.366
(dance music playing)

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.997
Hey.

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:54.085
Um, I know this guy.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.838
He hangs out at the hotel.
I see him all the time.

01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:59.924
And he works at
the Super Sports Channel.

01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:03.469
I told him about you,
and he says that they're hiring.

01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:07.598
Oh, I had a, uh, job opportunity
last week.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.976
Oh, you ruined it for me.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.979
Anyway, he's expecting
your call.

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.815
Now, whether you call him or not
is up to you.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.702
What are they doing here?

01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:29.162
NOAH:
They have a problem.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.121
DYLAN:
So?

01:02:30.204 --> 01:02:34.333
Oh, well, I said maybe
you'd help them out.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:35.418
Hey.

01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:38.754
Relax. Sit down and relax.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:42.008
Look, here's the deal.

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:44.886
She flushed some drugs down
the toilet when the cops came.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.512
Okay?

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:49.640
Now, her dealer thinks
he's got some money coming.

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.851
Benny fronted me over a kilo.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:54.687
His share of the sale
would be $90,000.

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.564
Only now, there isn't
going to be a sale.

01:02:56.647 --> 01:02:58.816
Yeah, he's not really
sympathetic to that argument.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.737
He says if I don't give him his
money, he's going to kill me.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:07.366
Look, I've heard of this guy.
She's not lying, okay?

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.494
Excuse us.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.834
So, you doing a lot of blow?
Is that what this is about?

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.753
I'm clean. I swear to God.

01:03:18.836 --> 01:03:21.088
Look, I am not your counselor,
I'm not your big brother.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.883
Dude, I barely even know you,
but I'm going to tell you this--

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.176
you don't get rid
of these people,

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:26.928
you're going to have a problem.

I thought your brother always
stays at the Four Seasons.

01:05:23.919 --> 01:05:25.838
Yeah, well, he says
he wants to catch up...

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:26.881
with my failures.

01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:28.007
He did not say that.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.717
No, but it's what he does.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.510
He sets a standard.
When I don't reach it...

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:34.013
His standards, not yours.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.681
Besides, I mean, look at him.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:36.682
He's a bond trader.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.809
What am I? An out-of-work
ambulance chaser.

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:42.021
Besides,
he's a huge bond trader.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.023
Lives in a huge house.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:46.817
His wife has
a huge engagement ring.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:48.861
-(doorbell ringing)
-Oh, shoot.

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:50.863
Let's go. Come on, come on.

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:53.157
Come on, come on, come on.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.535
I think my ring is perfect.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.996
Well, so do I,
but he's my big brother

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.206
and what he thinks affects me.

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:01.874
You don't have
to compete with him, okay?

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.542
I don't.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.879
But I do tend to sulk a lot when
he's around, just so you know.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.883
Hey, Patrick, come on in.

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.760
Mattie.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:14.136
And you must be Kelly.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.304
Yes. Mmm!

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:18.891
I'm Juliane.

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:20.017
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:21.102
Nice to meet you.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.521
Great place.

01:06:23.604 --> 01:06:25.439
I didn't know
you were doing this well.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:26.732
I'm not. It's a friend's house.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.025
I'm just renting
one of the rooms.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.236
I told you about the remodel
we're doing?

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.238
It's actually one
of the reasons we came out.

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.864
Pool construction is killing me.

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:34.865
Yeah.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:35.991
Don't listen to him.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:37.410
We're here
because we missed you.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.370
-Well, thank you.
-And because we wanted

01:06:39.453 --> 01:06:40.746
to welcome you to our family.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:41.997
Oh, thank you.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:46.419
So, uh... how's work?

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.963
You still keeping the streets
safe for the criminals?

01:06:49.046 --> 01:06:51.882
Well, actually right now,
I'm, uh...

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:53.759
on vacation for a few days.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.052
So we can hang out.

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.888
And I understand
you run a boutique?

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:00.975
Yes, I do... I did actually,
yesterday.

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:02.727
She started a vacation too.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.564
So we are both on vacation--
together.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.987
CUSTOMER:
Hmm, I don't know.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.405
It's going to look great.

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:16.782
Just try it on.
We'll accessorize, okay?

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.576
Do you have any
of these in small?

01:07:18.659 --> 01:07:19.952
I need one for my daughter.

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.162
Uh, sure. Just...

01:07:21.245 --> 01:07:23.831
You know what, give me one
second, I'll check in the back.

01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:24.832
Thanks.

01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:25.875
WOMAN:
Do you gift wrap?

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:28.002
Oh, of course she gift wraps.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:30.880
You gift wrap, right?

01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:31.964
(sighs)
Yeah.

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:33.299
Was the store always
this busy,

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.801
or does it seem busier now
that I'm doing it alone?

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:36.844
Well, just hang in there.

01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:39.638
I feel like I'm about
to lose it.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:40.973
WOMAN (clearing throat)
Pardon me,

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.975
but, uh, I am running late,
and you said

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.935
you were going to look for
a small for my daughter?

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:47.480
Oh, yes, yes, I'm going to.

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.690
Uh, you know what, I'll-I'll
check the back for you.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:50.274
Thank you.

01:07:50.357 --> 01:07:51.484
Relax.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.152
(sighs)

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.655
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:57.698
Got a second?

01:07:57.782 --> 01:07:58.908
-Uh, not really.
-Oh, okay.

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:01.535
Um, Matt's brother's in town
and things are really weird

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.829
and I thought maybe we could
talk, but we'll talk tonight.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.832
I can't. I'm going to the
buyers' meet and greet

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.167
-at the Design Center.
-But you hate those things.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.293
Well, now that I'm on my own,

01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:10.836
I have to do a lot of things
I hate.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.171
Ouch.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.923
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.006 --> 01:08:15.966
I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.176
I'm just really stressed out.

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:19.970
Look, we'll find time to talk,
I promise.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.055
Okay.

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:32.191
So, I understand
you're a personal trainer.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.692
Well, I-I have done that.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.027
But I still skate a lot.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:37.947
I was a first alternate
at the Olympics in '92.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:38.948
MAN:
Dylan told me.

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:41.200
Uh, Michael, sit up, please.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.743
Dad, this is boring.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.995
Sit up.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.332
I would have made the team,

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:51.877
but, uh, I pulled a muscle
during a warm-up.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.504
I know all about your career,
Gina,

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.923
and, uh, I could use someone
like you on the broadcast.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:57.925
Really? That's so great.

01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:00.344
But I'm going to need you to do
something for me first.

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:01.636
First as in right before

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.555
you give me
the Super Sports Channel job?

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.432
-(slurping)
-MAN: Michael!

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:07.309
I thought I told
you to stop.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:10.229
You know, left to his own
devices, this genius on my left

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:12.064
here would spend the entire day
playing video games.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.524
Can I go now?

01:09:13.607 --> 01:09:15.651
He's undisciplined
and he hates to exercise,

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.569
which is exactly
where you come in.

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.738
I don't understand.
You want me to train your son?

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.491
His school's winter carnival
dance is Saturday.

01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:26.328
Saturday, like, three days
from now Saturday?

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.912
Exactly.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.291
And so is the journalism job
of a lifetime.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.794
(Michael slurping)

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:42.261
(indistinct conversations)

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.888
(rock music plays low)

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.890
Aren't these the worst?

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:48.434
It's like being at
a high school dance,

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.269
but without the cool music
or the cute guys.

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.604
(chuckles)

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.731
I'm sorry, have we met?

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.482
Donna, I'm Camille Desmond
with <i> L.A. Fashion.</i>

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:56.984
I interviewed you last year
for our

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:58.819
-"Who's Hot, Who's Not" issue.
-That's right.

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:01.530
And as I recall, I didn't
make either list, but...

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:02.656
Over my objections.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.450
I wanted you on the good list.

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.951
I love your stuff,

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.494
and the way you've
marketed yourself.

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:08.662
Thank you.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.915
Well, up until now I've been
marketed by somebody else,

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.918
but, hey, this is me
marketing myself.

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.502
Tonight's a tough crowd.

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.796
You know, I've tried getting
dates with a lot of them.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.549
And the result is, I'm here
interviewing you.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.801
Oh, is that what this is,
an interview?

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:25.971
Yeah, I think profiling
you'd be great.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.973
Young female designer
on her own?

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.642
Young, single female designer.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.060
Make you sure include that

01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:33.938
for the, what, three straight
guys that subscribe.

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:36.440
I'll even mention it
to Dan Clemens.

01:10:36.523 --> 01:10:37.942
Oh, who's that?

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:40.277
Only the biggest buyer
for Federal department stores.

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.987
Really, and he's
a friend of yours?

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.822
Hmm, never met him.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.366
But you're about to.

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.662
MAN:
Hi.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.163
-I'm Dan.
-Hi, Dan.

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.290
I'm Donna.
Nice to meet you.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:59.797
I, uh... I understand
you design sweaters.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.340
Mm-hmm.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.968
I hear wool is-is back
this year.

01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:06.804
Personally, I-I prefer mohair.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:11.058
(chuckles)

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.939
(Janet laughs)

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:19.608
Wait, wait.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.527
Listen.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.862
I don't hear anything.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.864
Exactly. Thanks to Darby.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.574
Yeah. Come on.

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:32.371
Oh, man... oh, man, oh man...

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:35.666
Hey! You guys are back early,
huh?

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:37.376
Yeah, the movie was sold out.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.377
Where's Darby?

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.880
Uh, Maddy's asleep, but, uh,

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.550
maybe I should go
and check on her.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:48.721
I'm so s-sorry about this.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.764
I... Sorry.

01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:58.230
We had the baby monitor on
the whole time.

01:11:58.313 --> 01:11:59.231
Get out of this house.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:00.691
Now!

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.489
I'm sorry, okay?

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.868
(door opens and shuts)

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:16.582
So, tell me about this pool
of yours.

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:19.418
Huh? Is it one of those with the
current you swim against?

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.253
(chuckles)

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:22.296
It's just a pool.

01:12:22.379 --> 01:12:24.631
Olympic size, though, right?
Come on. Indulge me.

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.759
I want to know what it's like
to control the universe.

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:29.553
Tell us about Kelly.

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:30.804
She seems so nice.

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.639
Kelly? Yeah,
she's, um, she's great.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:33.891
Although she has decided

01:12:33.974 --> 01:12:35.601
to spend the rest of her life
with me,

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.102
so I guess you have
to wonder, huh?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.772
She really would have loved
to have been here.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.273
We can't have a baby.

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:43.442
What?

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:47.071
We've been trying, but we can't.

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:50.574
I can't. So as for
controlling the universe...

01:12:50.657 --> 01:12:55.162
Uh, hey, I didn't mean anything
by that. I was just...

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:58.540
(clears throat)
Um, when did you guys find out?

01:12:58.624 --> 01:12:59.792
Last week.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.919
Ever since, we've been
discussing our options.

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:04.296
Are you thinking
of adopting, or...?

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.090
We considered it.

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:07.925
But since there's nothing wrong
with Juliane...

01:13:08.008 --> 01:13:09.968
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:13.639
Um, we've decided to look
for a surrogate father.

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.641
A sperm donor.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:18.018
Oh, I-I think
that's a great idea.

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:22.689
Good, because you're the donor
we want.

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:36.662
(rock and roll music plays)

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:39.540
Can I get a coffee, please?
To go.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.420
Hey.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:47.840
(Steve chuckles dryly)

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:51.009
About last night...

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.761
Yeah, forget about it, Noah.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:55.806
Good. Listen, I told Darby
that we're done.

01:13:55.889 --> 01:13:57.307
You know, out of respect.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:01.019
Listen, anyway, uh,
did she say anything about me?

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.648
You know, about she and I...
being together.

01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:05.858
You didn't tell Janet.

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.026
Noah, did she say anything
or not?

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.070
No.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.197
But maybe she forgot.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.532
Like that's possible.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.325
(chuckles)
Okay. You know, Steve,

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:17.286
you're probably the best
she's ever had.

01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:19.329
Maybe.

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:22.499
But since you were so epic,
maybe, just maybe,

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.960
you should tell Janet
before Darby does.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.886
(sighs)

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:38.557
MATT:
Morning.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.767
Hi. You got back late.

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:41.643
Yeah, about midnight.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:43.562
I just didn't want
to, uh, wake you.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:45.022
Mmm.

01:14:45.105 --> 01:14:46.899
-I made you some coffee.
-Thanks.

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:49.776
Just so I know, um, are we still
on vacation?

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.904
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we are.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:54.198
(chuckles)

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:57.701
Um... Patrick and Juliane
want to have a baby.

01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:59.453
Yeah? Is she pregnant?

01:14:59.536 --> 01:15:02.915
No. No, she's not, and it seems
Patrick is the reason why.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:06.084
So they're looking
for a sperm donor.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.628
To measure up to his standards?

01:15:07.711 --> 01:15:09.922
What, are they gonna go to one
of those genius sperm banks?

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.757
Not quite, not quite.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.593
Uh, they asked me to do it.

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:16.762
You?

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:17.721
Me.

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:19.806
Said I was the most
decent person he knew.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.975
My brother said that about me.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.939
And I'm sure that meant
a lot to you,

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:31.318
but you... can't father
someone else's child.

01:15:31.401 --> 01:15:33.278
First of all,
Patrick isn't "someone else."

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.905
Okay, if this was some stranger,

01:15:34.988 --> 01:15:37.783
and this could be anonymous,
then I could possibly

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:39.952
understand how you could
consider this.

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.662
He's my brother, Kelly.

01:15:41.745 --> 01:15:43.956
Which means that someday
his kid will find out

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.582
that his uncle is really
his father.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.918
I mean, ask Donna and Gina what
a brilliant idea that was.

01:15:48.001 --> 01:15:50.212
All right, well, anyway, I told
him I'd think about it, okay?

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.800
And besides,
you and I are a team,

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:58.262
and whatever decisions we make,
we-we make together.

01:15:58.345 --> 01:15:59.972
I really don't think that
there's

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.348
a decision to be made here.

01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:02.724
I don't want you to do this.

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:07.771
GINA:
This is perfect, see?

01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:09.564
You gotta have a goal
to get in shape.

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:11.441
So here's your goals:
You're gonna go to the dance,

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:12.985
and you're gonna talk
to Nicole Laney.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.278
-Lewis.
-Whatever.

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.989
You think if I lost any weight,
my dad would be happy about it?

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.366
Oh, kid, look,
I really don't care

01:16:19.449 --> 01:16:20.993
whether or not
your father is happy,

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:22.953
but I would have
a great job, see?

01:16:23.036 --> 01:16:24.121
That's why I'm doing this.

01:16:24.204 --> 01:16:25.289
Ever since my mom died,

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:26.832
my dad's been
a total control freak.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:29.835
I get less than an A- on a test,
I'm punished.

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.128
I don't learn a new piece

01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:32.671
on the piano fast enough,
I'm punished.

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:35.007
My mom let me get my ear pierced
when I turned 13,

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.009
but no way he'll let me
wear an earring.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:39.970
Look, I really need this job.

01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:41.847
I don't know
if you understand that.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.977
Hey, hey, Michael...

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:51.773
Uh... I'm about to tell you
something I really shouldn't.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.025
What is it?

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:55.861
I think you'd look really good
with an earring.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:56.987
You do?

01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:58.739
Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

01:16:58.822 --> 01:17:01.408
And as you're walking really
fast, I think your goal

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:03.535
should be to just, you know,
think of a way

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.537
to tell your father
that that's what you want.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.205
I like that goal.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.207
Yeah? Okay, come on.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.709
We got a long way to go.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.502
You said it was just
around the corner.

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.171
Yeah, I lied.

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:29.936
Steve,
I didn't know you were there.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:30.604
Well, I, I wasn't.

01:17:30.687 --> 01:17:33.648
Um, I'm here now. (chuckles)

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:38.236
Listen, Darby, uh, do you
remember a keg party at CU...?

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.613
JANET:
Coming through.

01:17:39.696 --> 01:17:40.906
Lunchtime.

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.407
Did I interrupt something?

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.909
Oh, no, no. Steve was
just telling me...

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.911
The bottles for Madeline in
the refrigerator.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.037
You were gonna go get some.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.789
Okay.

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:51.917
I'll go do that, then.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.543
Thanks.

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:58.757
I really like her.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.093
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.886
I mean, I'm not a prude
or anything,

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:04.429
but somehow I can't help
but feel

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:07.432
like Maddy's world
is somehow contaminated.

01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:10.769
Why did Noah have
to go after her?

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:11.937
He didn't.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.565
You see, she went after him.

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:16.983
That's what he told you.

01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:18.652
And Steve, you believed him?

01:18:18.735 --> 01:18:19.736
I know Darby.

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.279
No, you don't.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:24.282
Not like I do, anyway.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.201
Um, I didn't remember at first.

01:18:26.284 --> 01:18:27.160
Remember what?

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:29.579
But then when, uh, Noah told me

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:30.789
a little bit
about his first date,

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.666
-I...
-You dated her?

01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:35.752
It was a... a frat party.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:37.170
It was meaningless...

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:40.424
Everything at a frat party
is meaningless, even sex.

01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:43.176
You had sex with our nanny?!

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.179
No. No, I-I...

01:18:46.263 --> 01:18:49.641
Yes. Before she was the nanny,
though.

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.476
Well, did you talk to her
about this?

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.603
Like, like, "How's Maddy's
diaper rash,

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:56.189
and by the way, do you still
wear thong underwear?"

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:58.108
Of course not.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:03.071
(Maddy fussing)

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:07.159
Here, let me take her.

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.493
I got it.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:20.464
In case you haven't heard,
those things can kill you.

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:21.965
Lots of traders smoke.

01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:23.675
I thought you were on vacation.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:24.634
I am.

01:19:27.387 --> 01:19:28.555
Matt turned me down.

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:31.057
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.309
He's not up there.

01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:35.020
When I see Matt, I'll tell him
that you're looking for him.

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:36.605
Forgive me for being so direct,

01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:39.524
but we both know he'd do this
if it weren't for you.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.860
That's a conversation I think
you need to have with him.

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:42.861
I already did.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.821
Which is why I know it's true.

01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:45.906
He told you that?

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:51.536
You can resolve this
without involving us.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.663
Not in any way that we'd like.

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:56.041
I'm sorry that you have
this problem,

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:59.628
but it's your problem, not ours.

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.425
DONNA:
<i>Okay, you are here</i>

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:07.260
to give me an honest opinion.

01:20:08.845 --> 01:20:10.722
(Donna sighs)

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:12.557
This screams "date," doesn't it?

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.142
It's very...

01:20:15.018 --> 01:20:16.061
...professional.

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.855
I'm gonna put the jacket on.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.567
(doorbell rings)

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.693
(sighs)

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:30.408
Oh, can't we just stay in
and watch <i> The Sopranos?</i>

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.243
Go.

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.369
Ugh!

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.998
Hi. You look great.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:41.253
Hi. I'll be right back.

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.591
Hey. David.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:47.759
Nice to meet you.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.681
(clicking sound)

01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:59.521
My dad had a snap factory.

01:20:59.604 --> 01:21:01.731
Jerry Clemens' Snappy Service.

01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:04.609
Uh, that's fascinating.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.781
Okay, all set.

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:11.199
You kids have fun.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.830
(mutters)

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:19.624
(door shuts)

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:24.796
(doorbell rings)

01:21:31.177 --> 01:21:33.680
Well, that was quick.

01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:35.140
Hi.

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:37.517
Is Donna here?

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:41.313
Uh, no. No, you just,
you just missed her.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:45.025
Oh, well, um, I just wanted
to tell her

01:21:45.108 --> 01:21:47.986
that my editor loves the story
I'm doing on her.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.321
So you're a journalist.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.031
Yes. I write for <i> L.A. Fashion.</i>

01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:53.325
Hi. Camille.

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:54.868
David.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.455
(chuckles)

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:03.335
Hey, whatcha doing out here?

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.629
I thought we were a team.

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:07.964
We are.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:10.675
Isn't Patrick here?
He knows we have dinner tonight.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:15.639
A team, uh, stands up for each
other, makes joint decisions,

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.349
-protects each other.
-If this is about

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.975
Patrick, I told him
I couldn't do it.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:21.811
Yeah, and you told him
that I was the reason why.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:22.979
This is not about you, Kelly.

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:25.065
It wouldn't have been, if you
would have protected me.

01:22:25.148 --> 01:22:27.525
Now I'm the bad guy.
I'm the reason that your brother

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.027
isn't going to live
happily ever after.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.862
Tell me, what would you
have done if you were me?

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:31.988
I would have taken
responsibility.

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:34.032
-Lied.
-Okay I would have lied.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.909
For you, for us, for the team.

01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:37.744
I mean, he says all those nice
things about you--

01:22:37.827 --> 01:22:40.038
which I believe in-- probably
just to get you to say yes.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:42.332
What did I say? I said no.

01:22:42.415 --> 01:22:43.375
And you blamed me.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.502
Let me tell you, my whole life

01:22:45.585 --> 01:22:47.545
I wait for my brother
to reach out to me.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:49.547
And when he finally does,
what do I do?

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.049
I turn him away.

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.676
Why? Because you asked me to.

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:55.428
You act like I told you not to
give him a kidney or something.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.097
They can find another donor.
They can adopt.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.723
He asked me for this.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:01.685
Like it or not, you are the
reason he's not going to get it.

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:05.021
(chuckles)
Unbelievable.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:06.731
You talk about responsibility.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.067
How about you take some?

01:23:18.284 --> 01:23:19.828
(door closes)

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:27.460
(doorbell ringing)

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.714
(doorbell ringing)

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:33.216
(knocking)

01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:34.217
Hi.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.552
Is, uh, Michael ready?

01:23:35.635 --> 01:23:37.011
No, he's not.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:38.263
Well, I-I know I'm early.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:39.764
It's just that
I'm kind of excited

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.433
because I think
we made some progress.

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:45.270
I think I kind of connected with
him the other day.

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:48.940
You were hired to train
his body, not his mind.

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:50.358
And I'm doing that.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.902
And how I choose to parent
is none of your business.

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:55.071
Maybe if you told me
what happened.

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:57.782
Michael.

01:24:03.788 --> 01:24:04.914
Oh, hey.

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.624
Tell him-- it's great, isn't it?

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.709
Um...

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.753
Michael...

01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:10.754
Go on, tell him.

01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:12.589
I-I think that it's, um,

01:24:12.672 --> 01:24:14.507
not really my place to say.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:16.176
Thank you, Michael.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.601
Look, here's, uh... $200.

01:24:24.684 --> 01:24:26.644
That should cover the, uh,
the training that you did.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:27.812
Oh, you don't have to do that.

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.981
Remember, I said I'd bill you
at the end of the month.

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:31.775
Oh, that won't be necessary.

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:36.863
And the Super Sports Channel
job?

01:24:36.946 --> 01:24:39.616
I filled it this morning.

01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.505
You claim that you don't
remember sleeping with Darby

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:54.506
when we interviewed her, right?

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:55.423
That's right.

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:56.925
And Darby probably
didn't say anything

01:24:57.008 --> 01:24:58.343
because she wanted the job.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:00.386
Look, Janet, we've been over
this a thousand times.

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:01.429
Okay, well, then I'm just
curious--

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:03.973
what did Noah say to you
that made you remember?

01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:05.642
And if this has anything
to do with cup size,

01:25:05.725 --> 01:25:07.560
there will be
a trial separation.

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:09.145
It's not what he said.

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:10.522
It's what he had.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.899
He had this thing on his neck.

01:25:12.982 --> 01:25:15.360
It was a hickey, okay?

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:16.528
Shaped like Idaho.

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.530
It's kind of like her trademark.

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:19.823
Ugh.

01:25:19.906 --> 01:25:21.199
Maddy's down for a nap.

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.201
You said you wanted
to talk to me?

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:25.703
Yeah, I can't have someone
caring for my child

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:26.913
that I don't trust.

01:25:26.996 --> 01:25:28.832
So I'm fired...

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:30.750
for what I did while
Maddy was sleeping?

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:33.169
You misled me about who you are,
Darby.

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:36.256
I told you I was inexperienced,
and I'm not.

01:25:36.339 --> 01:25:37.298
Big deal.

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:39.759
You weren't honest.

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:41.678
Well, what should I have done?

01:25:41.761 --> 01:25:43.930
Given you a list of guys
that I've slept with?

01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:45.515
STEVE:
Well, no, but mentioning

01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:47.684
that I was on it
probably would have helped.

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:52.355
It's okay, Darby.
Janet knows all about it.

01:25:52.438 --> 01:25:54.399
All about what?

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.025
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:58.069
Huh?

01:25:58.152 --> 01:26:01.364
Does the word "Idaho"
refresh your memory?

01:26:01.447 --> 01:26:02.574
No.

01:26:04.784 --> 01:26:06.452
Next time you hire a nanny,

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:08.955
I suggest you keep
your fantasies to yourself.

01:26:09.038 --> 01:26:09.914
What?!

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.086
Wha...?

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.754
-(door opens)
-Well, that's done.

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.256
(door slams)

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:19.299
What?

01:26:19.382 --> 01:26:20.633
She didn't remember.

01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:22.260
I thought you said
it was meaningless.

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:24.554
Oh, it <i> was</i> meaningless.

01:26:24.637 --> 01:26:27.223
I-I just... didn't say
it was forgettable.

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:29.809
I didn't say <i> I</i> was forgettable.

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:39.402
So, Dan bought
the entire collection, huh?

01:26:39.485 --> 01:26:40.612
Just about.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:43.740
Wow. Without
even a kiss good night?

01:26:43.823 --> 01:26:45.408
Oh, please.

01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:46.492
(chuckles)
I'm kidding.

01:26:46.576 --> 01:26:48.453
Congratulations.
You deserve it.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.955
Besides, it was just a peck.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.124
It wasn't a kiss at all--
he barely grazed me.

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:54.292
Oh, who am I kidding?

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.793
I kissed someone
to sell my sweaters--

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.128
how pathetic is that?

01:26:57.211 --> 01:26:59.631
Donna, not that a peck from you

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:01.090
wouldn't be worth it, but...

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:03.301
believe me, he wouldn't have
bought a single sweater

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:05.136
if he couldn't make
50% on it retail.

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:06.721
Really?

01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:09.349
Really.
Your honor is intact.

01:27:09.432 --> 01:27:11.809
The first calm moment
I've had in days.

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.019
Thank you for that.

01:27:13.102 --> 01:27:14.479
You're welcome.
No problem.

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:15.980
It's just been crazy.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.523
Even with Kelly.
I feel like she thinks

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:18.483
I'm not there for her anymore.

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.944
Come on; we're gonna
be late for the movie.

01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:22.237
We're going to a movie?

01:27:23.237 --> 01:27:25.323
Uh...<i> we</i> are.

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:26.991
CAMILLE:
Yeah, I came by last night

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.618
after you left,
and David gave me

01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:31.162
some great stuff
for the article.

01:27:31.245 --> 01:27:32.664
-Did he?
-DAVID: Yeah, any juicy stuff

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.707
you read in there that's
from an anonymous source,

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:36.542
that... that'd be me,
thank you very much.

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:38.670
He knows nothing,
nothing at all.

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:40.129
I know everything.

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:42.507
You ready?

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.675
Bye.

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:46.177
Um, we'll talk more... later.

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.054
Have fun.

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:52.642
(clicks tongue)

01:27:55.561 --> 01:27:58.481
(dance music playing)

01:27:58.564 --> 01:28:00.692
Oh, great-- my favorite.

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.986
-I spoke to your friend.
-Who?

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:04.696
Oh, you know--
the fabulous guy

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:06.864
who was supposed
to get me the great job.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.616
Oh, yeah.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.034
Uh... did he?

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.996
Yeah, he did, if I trained
his son, which I did...

01:28:13.079 --> 01:28:14.872
until he fired me.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:16.249
What happened?

01:28:16.332 --> 01:28:18.501
Apparently, he didn't like
the fact that I had

01:28:18.584 --> 01:28:20.503
something to say about
the way he treated his son.

01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:21.713
-(sighs)
-That kid's father

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:25.550
is exactly like my mother--
you know, pushy and critical.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.052
I mean,<i> I</i> never got to go to any
high school dances or my prom.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.013
Why? Because I had to train,
or I had to go to bed early

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:31.597
so I could get up early
to train, you know?

01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:33.599
Or-or I was being punished
for not training hard enough.

01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:36.561
What is, uh,
the kid training for?

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:39.022
(laughs) No, that's
the thing, see? Nothing.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:42.400
This sweet little kid, I mean,
all he wants to do, you know, is

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:45.570
go to this Hensley Valley
High School dance.

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.947
I mean, it's
a completely different family

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:49.866
with different problems, but...

01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:52.243
the end result is the same.

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:54.537
The kid always suffers.

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.663
You know?

01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:59.083
You don't know. Forget it.

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.089
(knocking on door)

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.262
Hi! Come in.

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:13.264
Hi. I was, um, looking for Matt.

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:15.767
Oh, he's not here; he's probably
on his way to the office.

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.351
PATRICK (murmurs):
What do ya say?

01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:18.561
-What do ya say?
-(Maddy cooing)

01:29:18.644 --> 01:29:20.271
Oh, Janet and Steve went out.

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:21.564
We're baby-sitting.

01:29:21.647 --> 01:29:22.940
Oh.

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:26.235
Listen, about what
you asked Matt to do...

01:29:26.319 --> 01:29:27.779
You don't have to feel badly.

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:29.322
If I were in your position,

01:29:29.405 --> 01:29:31.908
I'd have reacted
exactly the same way.

01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:34.285
I just want you to know
that it's nothing personal.

01:29:34.368 --> 01:29:35.495
I do.

01:29:35.578 --> 01:29:37.455
And so does Patrick.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.415
For what it's worth,

01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:43.002
Matt was incredibly touched
that you asked him.

01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:44.045
Well, sooner or later in life,

01:29:44.128 --> 01:29:47.465
something happens
that's beyond your control.

01:29:48.424 --> 01:29:49.926
And when you're with
someone like Patrick,

01:29:50.009 --> 01:29:52.303
you begin to wonder
how they'll react

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:54.514
when that something
happens to them.

01:29:54.597 --> 01:29:57.141
See there? See there?
What's that?

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:59.102
I've never been
more proud of him.

01:29:59.185 --> 01:30:00.478
Whoever our children are,

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:02.855
they're going to have
a fantastic father.

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:08.069
(Patrick murmuring)

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.662
A very pissed-off dealer's
breathing down my sister's neck.

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.539
Did you tell Dylan <i> that?</i>

01:30:19.622 --> 01:30:21.624
Yeah, I told him.
He wasn't moved.

01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:24.585
Oh, my God.

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:25.795
I'm dead.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.673
You said he'd help us,

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.716
that he'd do what you told him.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.845
No. I said I would try,
and I did.

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:34.846
Well, try again.

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.639
Maybe you guys aren't listening.

01:30:36.722 --> 01:30:38.516
The answer is no.

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:41.185
Do you have any family?

01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:44.230
Yeah, a brother
and a half sister. Why?

01:30:44.313 --> 01:30:45.523
That's nice.

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:48.276
I just want to make sure
that you understand

01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:51.696
when I say I love
my sister very much...

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.698
and if something
were to happen to her...

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:54.699
Whoa, whoa.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.159
Are you threatening me?

01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:58.494
...I may have to lash out.

01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:00.580
You know, redirect my anger.

01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:03.416
Don't let it be at you.

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:08.045
Let me explain something
to you guys, okay?

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:11.090
I was your last chance
of getting Dylan to help you.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:13.801
Because of that
stupid outburst...

01:31:15.052 --> 01:31:17.680
...you lost that chance.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.435
Have a nice day.

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:39.076
Dan. Hi.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.369
Hi.

01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:41.787
Well... wow.

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.706
Thank you.
You shouldn't have.

01:31:43.789 --> 01:31:46.459
Are-are you free
for dinner tonight?

01:31:46.542 --> 01:31:48.794
Free? Oh, well...
thanks to your order,

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:51.380
I barely have time
to breathe, you know?

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:52.590
Um...

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:54.258
this-this weekend, then?

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.594
Um, the planetarium's
running this movie

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:59.597
on the moons of Jupiter
that's just amazing.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.891
I'm sure it is,
but, um, you know what?

01:32:01.974 --> 01:32:03.935
This weekend's not
gonna work, either.

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:04.936
That's okay.

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:06.979
Um... it's playing for a month.

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:08.731
We can go anytime.

01:32:08.814 --> 01:32:10.608
But I don't think
we're going to.

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.485
You and me, us,

01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:15.071
it's... this really isn't
going anywhere.

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:17.615
(laughs nervously):
Well...

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:19.742
-I'm embarrassed.
-I'm sorry.

01:32:19.825 --> 01:32:21.619
I-I didn't mean to mislead you.

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:25.790
It's just... I'm on my own now,
an-and I'm incredibly nervous,

01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:29.460
and... if you want to cancel
the order, I understand.

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:31.587
I'm not going to do that.

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:32.797
Thank you.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.341
Hey, you're...
you're a great designer.

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:39.303
Even if you do have
terrible taste in men.

01:32:45.184 --> 01:32:46.519
Mmm.

01:32:48.854 --> 01:32:50.439
DAVID:
So...

01:32:50.523 --> 01:32:51.524
how'd that go?

01:32:51.607 --> 01:32:55.194
Well, another victory
for Donna Martin Originals,

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:57.530
another in a series
of disasters for me.

01:32:57.613 --> 01:32:59.699
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

01:32:59.782 --> 01:33:01.284
Mm-hmm.

01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:02.159
You're gonna meet
the perfect guy,

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.619
you're gonna live in
the perfect house,

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:04.996
you're gonna have
the perfect kids.

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:07.748
Everything is going
to be disgustingly perfect.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:09.750
And soon, it's gotta happen
soon, right?

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:11.335
'Cause any more dating hell

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:13.462
and I might just give up
altogether.

01:33:13.546 --> 01:33:14.547
It'll happen, all right?

01:33:14.630 --> 01:33:16.007
-Mmm...
-Oh, yeah.

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.717
-It will
-You know what?

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:20.386
I think that we should just
blow off the day,

01:33:20.469 --> 01:33:22.680
forget about our problems,
I'll close up the store,

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:24.223
and we'll go to the beach.
How's that sound?

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:25.391
That sounds great. I...

01:33:25.474 --> 01:33:27.977
Um...

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.521
I've already got plans
to hang out with Camille today.

01:33:30.604 --> 01:33:34.817
Oh, sure, of course.

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.193
Kind of feel bad.

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:39.780
No, go. I'm... "fine."

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.284
All right.

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:51.667
JANET: I believe that you didn't
remember Darby at first,

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.502
but my point is you did
eventually,

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:54.712
and you didn't tell me.

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:55.838
That's because you liked her!

01:33:55.921 --> 01:33:57.673
What am I gonna do?!
You liked her!

01:33:57.757 --> 01:33:59.592
Oh, so you lied for my benefit?

01:33:59.675 --> 01:34:02.553
No, I lied for my benefit,
and I was wrong, okay?

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.555
-I'm sorry. -(calliope music
plays in distance)

01:34:04.638 --> 01:34:05.890
(smooches)

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:07.892
-It's okay.
-Good.

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:09.894
I've got three
prospective nannies

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.354
-coming over this afternoon.
-Good.

01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:13.064
They sound pretty great
over the phone.

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.899
-Hmm.
-They're Guatemalan.

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:17.234
You haven't been with anyone
Guatemalan, have you?

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.737
Because I've got some Salvadoran
backups, just in case.

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:20.613
Janet, come on!

01:34:20.696 --> 01:34:23.074
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
She forgot.

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.242
-Ugh!
-I know, but I'm sorry.

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:26.744
You got to twist
that knife, huh?

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:28.954
Oh, look, here we are.

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:31.791
Here? This is the special place
you wanted to bring me?

01:34:31.874 --> 01:34:35.544
Mm-hmm. It's where you brought
me on our seventh date.

01:34:35.628 --> 01:34:37.546
I did?

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.924
You remember our seventh date?

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:42.259
Sure, because it was on
our seventh date

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:43.552
that I fell in love with you.

01:34:43.636 --> 01:34:45.596
You did? Here?

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.223
See, what people remember has
nothing

01:34:47.306 --> 01:34:49.392
to do with you
or your performance.

01:34:49.475 --> 01:34:51.435
It has to do with them

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:54.021
and where they're at
at any given moment.

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:55.731
I knew you wouldn't remember
this place,

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:58.150
but I don't care, because
it was my moment.

01:34:58.234 --> 01:35:00.444
And that's enough.

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.405
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:35:02.488 --> 01:35:03.656
Yes, I do.

01:35:03.739 --> 01:35:06.742
And I'll never forget.

01:35:06.826 --> 01:35:08.744
STEVE:
Whoo!

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:10.871
(Janet giggles)

01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:19.588
Hi.

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:21.006
Hey.

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:22.842
Hey, you got a minute?

01:35:22.925 --> 01:35:24.635
Sure.

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:28.139
I've been thinking about
what you said,

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:31.142
and the part that sticks out
most is

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:33.102
when you said
it wasn't about me.

01:35:33.185 --> 01:35:34.520
And it's not.

01:35:34.603 --> 01:35:35.688
I know that.

01:35:35.771 --> 01:35:40.025
It affects me,
it changes my life,

01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:41.819
it complicates my world,

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:44.530
but... it's not about me.

01:35:44.613 --> 01:35:48.075
It's about you and your brother
and your family.

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:49.618
And you are part of that family.

01:35:49.702 --> 01:35:51.662
Which means I have
responsibilities.

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:54.999
I need to take responsibility,
and I'm not very good at that.

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:57.835
So, is that why you're here?

01:35:57.918 --> 01:36:00.504
To take responsibility
for saying no to my brother?

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:03.632
Actually... no.

01:36:03.716 --> 01:36:07.511
I'm here to take responsibility
for saying yes.

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:09.513
Hmm.

01:36:12.057 --> 01:36:14.894
Now are you sure about this?

01:36:14.977 --> 01:36:17.146
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:36:27.907 --> 01:36:30.034
(doorbell rings)

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.915
(sighs) What are you doing here?

01:36:35.998 --> 01:36:38.375
I'm here to pick up Michael
for our date.

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:40.544
He's not going. You know that.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.713
I know that you don't want
him to go.

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:45.716
What, is he grounded
for not losing weight?

01:36:45.799 --> 01:36:47.051
Not doing his chores?

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:50.012
Just not living up
to your expectations?

01:36:50.095 --> 01:36:51.722
He needs discipline.

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:53.766
And I certainly don't have
to defend myself to you.

01:36:53.849 --> 01:36:56.143
No, you don't,
but you do to your son.

01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:57.728
I mean, do you think that I got

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:58.896
to the Olympics with no
discipline?

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:01.065
I know you need discipline
and rules and regulations.

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:03.400
But you also need to have fun.

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:07.488
I mean, everybody needs
a little freedom.

01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:11.742
It's just that my mom
didn't know that, you know?

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.245
And she was always criticizing
me all the time.

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:16.580
She just turned me into a...

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:21.627
self-hating, codependent
bulimic...

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:24.255
...bitch.
(chuckles)

01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:28.926
So you can go ahead and shut
the door on me, if you want.

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:30.803
I just want your son

01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:32.846
to have a fair chance
at being happy.

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:36.600
Why don't you tell Michael
that his date is waiting

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:38.102
in the car for him?

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:40.271
Wait...

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:42.856
please.

01:37:47.152 --> 01:37:50.114
Michael had a great mom.

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:53.784
And ever since she died, I've...

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:56.620
I've been a little lost.

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:59.957
I guess I tried to keep things
under control by being tough.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.668
I guess you must see
a lot of her in him, huh?

01:38:02.751 --> 01:38:05.838
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:08.966
Well, maybe you should just
try listening to him more.

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:27.276
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:45.544
Kel, if this is gonna be about
how things have changed, um...

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:47.671
now's really not a good time.

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:50.466
I want to read you something.

01:38:50.549 --> 01:38:52.593
Because I know things
have changed, okay?

01:38:52.676 --> 01:38:55.512
I'm alone at the store,
I'm alone at night,

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.640
I'm... I'm alone all the time.

01:38:57.723 --> 01:38:59.516
Just listen, okay?
