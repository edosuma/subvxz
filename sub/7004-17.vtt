WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:03.568
Well, it's the end
of floor finishing week
here on <i>tool time.</i>

00:03.569 --> 00:05.570
We got a big finish for you.
That's right.

00:05.571 --> 00:07.939
We're gonna shoot al
out of a giant glue gun.

00:07.939 --> 00:09.774
There'll be pieces
of al everywhere.

00:09.775 --> 00:11.776
It's gonna be a great show,
so stay tuned.

00:11.777 --> 00:13.778
We are not. We're going to
finish finishing our floor.

00:13.779 --> 00:16.280
If you said
"finish finishing"
like that in finland,

00:16.280 --> 00:18.950
You'd be finished already.
Tim.

00:18.951 --> 00:21.620
Now, if you want a strong
waterproof finish,

00:21.621 --> 00:24.923
You can't go wrong
with polyurethane.

00:24.924 --> 00:26.791
Now, we've already
applied one coat

00:26.792 --> 00:28.927
With our lamb's-wool
applicator.

00:28.928 --> 00:32.229
If your hardware store
doesn't stock a lamb's-wool
applicator, don't fret.

00:32.231 --> 00:35.967
You just duct tape
your pet lamb to a pole.

00:37.937 --> 00:41.472
<i>(sound effect</i>
<i>of sheep bleating)</i>

00:43.342 --> 00:45.343
For best results,
you wanna use two coats.

00:45.344 --> 00:47.345
However, before applying
the second one,

00:47.346 --> 00:49.981
You wanna scuff the first coat
with a fiberglass screen,

00:49.982 --> 00:52.283
Which will help
the second coat
adhere better.

00:52.284 --> 00:54.986
Easy to install -
just set it down
underneath your buffer

00:54.987 --> 00:56.721
And start buffing.

00:56.722 --> 00:59.724
Al uses one of these
to buff his legs
before he waxes 'em.

01:02.494 --> 01:05.495
Now, speaking of wax -
for a gentler, smoother shine,

01:05.497 --> 01:07.732
I suggest going with just wax.

01:07.733 --> 01:11.102
Of course...
<i>(squeaks)</i>

01:11.103 --> 01:13.504
With all the wax
I got in there,

01:13.505 --> 01:16.007
You could wax
a whole basketball court.

01:16.008 --> 01:18.643
Remind me not
to shake your hand
at the end of the show.

01:20.946 --> 01:22.947
All right, I'm ready
to buff out my wax.

01:22.948 --> 01:24.783
We'll show you
the difference between
the two finishes,

01:24.784 --> 01:26.818
But al's using the buffer,
so I've brought my own.

01:26.819 --> 01:29.587
Heidi and stumpy,
could you bring out
my buffer, please?

01:35.127 --> 01:37.528
Here you go, tim.

01:37.529 --> 01:39.964
Thank you, guys.
Thank you, stump.

01:44.469 --> 01:47.005
Could you have built
a bigger buffer?

01:47.006 --> 01:48.773
I didn't build this.

01:48.774 --> 01:51.475
I bought this at bob's
big and tall appliance shop.

01:53.612 --> 01:55.613
I'm ready to buff this up.
Watch the shine.

01:55.614 --> 01:57.148
Klaus, my music, please.

01:57.149 --> 02:00.585
<i>(♪ "hungarian dance no. 5"</i>
<i>by brahms)</i>

02:10.162 --> 02:11.329
Perfect.

03:03.282 --> 03:05.283
Wanna taste
my alfredo sauce?

03:05.284 --> 03:08.386
If I taste it now,
can I skip it at dinner?

03:11.190 --> 03:13.992
Forget it.
I'll taste it myself.

03:19.598 --> 03:21.565
Hi.

03:25.104 --> 03:28.306
Alfredo face.

03:28.307 --> 03:31.943
Hey. No, no.

03:31.944 --> 03:33.945
Bet you can't guess
where I came from.

03:33.946 --> 03:35.146
Art museum?

03:38.984 --> 03:40.952
Slippery steve's
snowmobiles.

03:40.953 --> 03:44.555
He doesn't generally
rent them, but for me
he will make an exception.

03:44.556 --> 03:46.958
It is so great
to be married to a man

03:46.959 --> 03:49.527
With that kind of power.

03:50.963 --> 03:54.665
But I must learn
to use my power
for good, not evil.

03:54.666 --> 03:57.202
And the good would be?

03:57.203 --> 04:00.271
How about a snowmobile party
for randy's birthday?

04:00.272 --> 04:02.606
Dad, I don't know
about a snowmobile party.

04:02.607 --> 04:04.275
Come on, think about it.

04:04.276 --> 04:06.244
There's no better way
to say happy birthday

04:06.245 --> 04:08.079
Than saying it
at 85 miles an hour,

04:08.080 --> 04:11.082
Blistering across the tundra,
icicles frozen to your face.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.585
"I can't see anything!"

04:14.586 --> 04:16.254
As good as that sounds,

04:16.255 --> 04:18.923
I was thinking about
having a boy-girl party
in the basement.

04:18.923 --> 04:21.692
Girls love snowmobiles.
What girls?

04:21.692 --> 04:24.695
Snowmobile chicks.

04:24.696 --> 04:28.699
Tim, nobody has their
first boy-girl party
on a snowmobile.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.800
I did.

04:29.801 --> 04:31.702
Nobody normal.

04:31.703 --> 04:33.738
At my first boy-girl party,

04:33.739 --> 04:36.274
All the girls wore
frilly little dresses,

04:36.275 --> 04:38.409
And the boys
wore suits and ties.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.912
We played charades
and telephone.

04:40.913 --> 04:44.849
Mom, things have changed
in the last 100 years.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.450

Wilson, are you naked?

05:10.209 --> 05:12.944
No, tim, I'm wearing a hat.

05:16.748 --> 05:20.518
Why are you naked?

05:20.519 --> 05:22.520
Well, tim, in finland,
they believe

05:22.521 --> 05:25.890
That to rejuvenate
the body and the soul,
you take a hot sauna bath,

05:25.891 --> 05:28.893
And you follow that
with an ice-cold snow massage.

05:28.894 --> 05:31.729
What do they follow
that up with, a heart attack?

05:31.730 --> 05:33.731
<i>(laughs)</i>

05:33.732 --> 05:36.767
No, no, no, tim. Actually,
it's quite invigorating.

05:36.768 --> 05:39.537
Maybe you'd like to join me
for a hot sauna sometime.

05:39.538 --> 05:43.308
There's always room for two
under my dome. Ohh.

05:43.309 --> 05:44.775
No, thanks, wilson.

05:44.776 --> 05:49.013
I'm not much of a
"get naked with your
neighbor" kind of guy.

05:49.014 --> 05:51.482
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:51.483 --> 05:55.219
So how did things go over
at the snowmobile place?

05:55.220 --> 05:57.221
Steve said he'd rent me
the snowmobiles,

05:57.222 --> 05:59.723
But randy would rather
have a boy-girl party.

05:59.724 --> 06:01.625
Well, you don't sound
too happy about that.

06:01.626 --> 06:04.929
What's there for me to do
at a boy-girl party?

06:04.930 --> 06:07.498
Why do you feel
you have to do anything?

06:07.499 --> 06:10.234
'cause I like getting involved
in my boys' birthdays.

06:10.235 --> 06:12.270
I...

06:12.271 --> 06:14.405
Are you still naked?

06:14.406 --> 06:16.207
No, no, no, no.
I'm all covered up.

06:17.876 --> 06:21.012
For brad's 13th birthday,
we went to a tractor pull,

06:21.013 --> 06:23.914
And we got mud
all over our heads,

06:23.915 --> 06:26.084
And I was hoping
that randy's birthday

06:26.085 --> 06:28.219
Would be just as memorable.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.221
Maybe you should do
something different

06:30.222 --> 06:32.590
To participate in randy's
birthday celebration.

06:32.591 --> 06:34.859
As the english author
samuel johnson said,

06:34.860 --> 06:36.694
"our brightest blazes
of gladness

06:36.695 --> 06:39.397
Are commonly kindled
by unexpected sparks."

06:39.398 --> 06:41.932
If anyone knows
about unexpected sparks,
it'd be me.

06:41.933 --> 06:43.801
<i>(chuckles)</i>

06:43.802 --> 06:45.603
Well, I think
you'd be more fulfilled

06:45.604 --> 06:49.440
If you did something
for randy that was both
unique and unexpected.

06:49.441 --> 06:50.741
Like what?

06:50.742 --> 06:53.577
If I knew that,
it wouldn't be unexpected.

06:53.578 --> 06:55.246
Wait. But unexpected,
you're saying...

06:55.247 --> 06:58.716
<i>(grunts)</i>

06:58.717 --> 07:00.918
You know what's really
unexpected?
What's that?

07:00.919 --> 07:02.653
The position of that tattoo.

07:05.290 --> 07:07.958
Tim, that's no tattoo.
I just sat on a live coal.

07:07.959 --> 07:10.028
Whoo!

07:14.666 --> 07:17.135
Dad, I'm supposed
to go over to jimmy's
for a sleepover.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.303
All right,
we're almost done.
Let me see that wax.

07:19.304 --> 07:22.673
You already put on 16 coats.
Why do you have to put on
so much?

07:22.674 --> 07:24.575
'cause it's randy's
birthday present.

07:24.576 --> 07:26.277
I want to make sure
the dance floor is perfect.

07:26.278 --> 07:29.147
Can I try the polisher?
I'll show you in a minute.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.715
You gotta adjust this
by hand.

07:31.716 --> 07:33.418
I'm good. I can do it
while it's moving

07:33.419 --> 07:35.086
But you gotta be
good at this.

07:35.087 --> 07:37.388
So if you get your cuff
caught in there...

07:54.206 --> 07:55.973
So how do I look?

07:55.974 --> 07:57.275
What's different?

07:57.276 --> 07:59.577
I changed shoes.

08:00.979 --> 08:03.281
Randy, what are you
so nervous about?

08:03.282 --> 08:05.849
Well, you see, there's
this girl michelle
coming to the party.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.851
Randy, michelle's
not gonna care

08:07.852 --> 08:10.054
About what pair of shoes
you're wearing.

08:10.055 --> 08:13.291
All she's gonna care about
is she gets to have fun
at the party.

08:13.292 --> 08:17.295
And she doesn't want any
nerdy parents hanging around.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.363
Great news.

08:19.364 --> 08:22.800
Guess what I found
in the closet - my old 45s.

08:27.473 --> 08:30.174
You're gonna let us
have guns at the party?

08:36.248 --> 08:37.748
These are records.

08:37.749 --> 08:40.818
This is the music I used
to listen to at my parties.

08:40.818 --> 08:43.988
Oh, this can't be good.
Oh...

08:43.989 --> 08:47.925
"hurdy gurdy man"

08:47.926 --> 08:51.329
Oh. Oh. This is
a great slow song.

08:56.268 --> 08:57.435

08:57.436 --> 08:59.103

about it, randy.

08:59.104 --> 09:01.539
There's not a machine
in the city that'll
play those things.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.207
Not true.

09:03.208 --> 09:08.546
I found my old
princess record player
in the closet, too.

09:08.547 --> 09:11.715
Now all I have to do now
is find a needle for it.

09:11.716 --> 09:14.318
Hey, why don't you just hop
into your time machine?

09:14.319 --> 09:16.287

The person who
followed me in

09:34.573 --> 09:37.007
Oh, I'm so happy
to meet you.
I'm jill taylor.

09:37.008 --> 09:39.009
Ok, dad. You've met
his mother,

09:39.010 --> 09:41.845
And you can see that
she looks basically normal.

09:41.846 --> 09:43.481
You can go now.

09:43.482 --> 09:46.250
Um, listen, I can assure
you that my husband
and I will be here

09:46.251 --> 09:47.918
To supervise the party
the whole time.

09:47.919 --> 09:49.654
We're very
responsible people.

09:49.655 --> 09:52.089

Come here, shake his hand.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.173
Not a good time, honey.

10:09.174 --> 10:12.009
Now wait a minute.
Aren't you the guy
on that tool show?

10:12.010 --> 10:14.212
Yes, I am.

10:14.213 --> 10:17.881
I love that episode
where you lit
your sleeve on fire.

10:17.882 --> 10:20.685
Classic episode.
I got that thing on tape.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.720
If you wanna watch it,
I got it.

10:24.189 --> 10:25.690
You're wondering

10:25.691 --> 10:28.426
Why I don't have
any pants on, aren't you?

10:28.427 --> 10:30.928
Why is your father
walking around
in his underwear?

10:30.929 --> 10:32.663
To ruin my life.

10:32.664 --> 10:34.965
Do you know, I switched
from brief to boxers

10:34.966 --> 10:38.469
Because they're more
freeing when you're
in a pair of slacks.

10:38.470 --> 10:41.639
I'm gonna go and get
a pair of sansabelts
on right now.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.641
You guys just hold still.
I'll get some slacks on.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.309
I'll be right back.

michelle to dance?

10:55.120 --> 10:58.289
You're supposed to wait an hour
before you go dancing.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.625
That's swimming.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.694

Hey, michelle.

11:17.509 --> 11:18.942
Hi.

11:18.943 --> 11:21.779
So are you, uh,
having a good time?

11:21.780 --> 11:24.114
Not really.

11:24.115 --> 11:26.116
Well, neither am I.

11:26.117 --> 11:29.019
I'd leave,
but this is my house.

11:31.122 --> 11:32.823
I like your shoes.

11:34.793 --> 11:37.428
I like your ears.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.030
What?

11:40.031 --> 11:43.601
I mean, I just never
noticed 'em at school before.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.737
I always bring them with me.

11:46.738 --> 11:48.739
Yeah, it's just -
usually, you know,

11:48.740 --> 11:50.741
You wear your hair down
and you can't see 'em,

11:50.742 --> 11:54.312
But now you can,
and they really
match your nose.

11:56.548 --> 11:57.782
Thanks.

11:57.783 --> 12:01.385
I'm really glad
your father let you stay.

12:01.386 --> 12:04.622
I'm really glad your father
put some pants on.

12:07.659 --> 12:08.926
Oh!

12:18.102 --> 12:19.770
How come no one's dancing?

12:19.771 --> 12:23.607
This floor isn't just
for looking at.
Come on.

12:23.608 --> 12:25.443
Hey, sherman.
How you doing, buddy?

12:25.444 --> 12:27.878
What do you think
of the dance floor?
I made this for randy.

12:27.879 --> 12:30.247
Did your dad ever make you
a dance floor like this?

12:30.248 --> 12:32.282
No. I kept dropping hints,

12:32.283 --> 12:34.284
But all I got
was a crummy cd player.

12:34.285 --> 12:35.753
Ha.

12:39.624 --> 12:42.292
Hey, dad, I thought
you told me you were
gonna stay upstairs.

12:42.293 --> 12:44.895
I thought I'd come down
and help everybody
get the party going.

12:44.896 --> 12:49.367
A little dancing.
Everybody, come on.
Baby circles.

12:51.436 --> 12:55.706
I'm the king. No one
ever gave me nothing.
Shut up! Whoo!

12:57.008 --> 12:59.009
Dad. Dad.
You're killing me here.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.911
Could you go
upstairs, please?

13:00.912 --> 13:03.347
Yeah, all right.

13:06.084 --> 13:09.920
So, michelle,
do you wanna...

13:09.921 --> 13:11.255
Dance?

13:11.256 --> 13:14.258
Yeah, sure.
Thanks for asking.

13:14.259 --> 13:16.394
I'm so proud.
That's my floor, right there.

13:20.365 --> 13:22.833
Michelle, are you ok?
I don't think so.

13:25.069 --> 13:27.971
Give me a hand.
Are you all right?

13:31.042 --> 13:33.076
♪ to sir

13:33.077 --> 13:35.613
♪ with love

13:35.614 --> 13:38.115
<i>(hums)</i>

13:38.116 --> 13:40.117
I think she should
go to the doctor.

13:40.118 --> 13:41.585
I'm not sick.
I'm just singing.

13:41.586 --> 13:43.587
Sit here.

13:43.588 --> 13:45.589
I'm really sorry
about this, michelle.

13:45.590 --> 13:48.125
What did you do? Tim!

13:50.595 --> 13:53.363
I might have put
a smidge too much wax
on the dance floor.

13:53.364 --> 13:56.801
A smidge? You could hold
ice capades on that thing.

13:56.802 --> 13:59.136
Speaking of which,
we need some ice.

13:59.137 --> 14:00.571
Well, I just put it all
in the punch.

14:00.572 --> 14:03.474
Yeah? That's easy.
No.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.576
Come on. She's gotta stick
her foot in there.

14:05.577 --> 14:07.445
Go ahead, put it in there.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.279
It's freezing.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.483
Cold will help stop swelling.
Tomorrow you gotta put heat
on there.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.653
Yeah, come back
and we'll stick your foot
in a tub of hot chocolate.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.425
We'd better call
her parents.

14:21.426 --> 14:23.226
What's your
home phone number?

14:23.227 --> 14:24.929
Oh, no one's home.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.931
My mom's out of town
and my dad's buying
a new car.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.967
We need someone to call...
What kind?

14:29.968 --> 14:31.936
Dad.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.537
My ankle really hurts.

14:33.538 --> 14:36.073
Oh, look,
it's turning purple.

14:43.114 --> 14:44.782
Whoa.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.917
Oh, great.
This place is packed.

14:46.918 --> 14:49.987
It's busier than usual.
You should have had
the party in here.

14:49.988 --> 14:52.122
Dad, it's bad enough
you might have
broken her ankle.

14:52.123 --> 14:54.324
Don't make her listen
to your jokes.

14:54.325 --> 14:58.095
Just watch her, will you?
I'll see if I can
move things along.

14:58.096 --> 15:00.030
Don't touch him.

15:00.031 --> 15:01.765
Hey, marge.

15:01.766 --> 15:04.835
Hey, tim. I see
your eyebrows grew back.

15:07.472 --> 15:09.239
Well, they always do.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.475
And they're bushier.
They're thicker this time.

15:11.476 --> 15:14.712
Your wife called
about a little girl
with an injured ankle.

15:14.713 --> 15:18.048
It's randy's birthday party,
and she slipped
on the dance floor.

15:18.049 --> 15:19.416
Kids.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.418
Slipped on the dance floor?

15:21.419 --> 15:25.355
Let me guess -
you overwaxed.

15:25.356 --> 15:27.057
You know me too well, marge.

15:27.058 --> 15:30.260
I should. I see you
more often than I see
my own husband.

15:30.261 --> 15:33.096
Um, since I'm such
a good customer,

15:33.097 --> 15:36.066
You think I could move them
to the head of the line?

15:36.067 --> 15:38.235
I wish I could
help you out, tim,

15:38.236 --> 15:40.004
But dr. Harris
is on tonight,

15:40.005 --> 15:43.941
And you know what a stickler
for the rules he is.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.776
Dr. Howie harris?

15:45.777 --> 15:48.311
Uh-huh.
He owes me one.

15:48.312 --> 15:53.283
I inspired that paper he did
on odd head injuries.

15:53.284 --> 15:55.619
Well, you can try
to talk to him.

15:55.620 --> 15:59.456
He's in examining room two.
Be sure to knock first.
Always do.

15:59.457 --> 16:03.360
I'm gonna try to talk
the doctor into moving you
ahead of these people.

16:03.361 --> 16:06.163
Except you, pal.
It's all right.

16:06.164 --> 16:07.932
Don't touch him.

16:11.402 --> 16:13.938
I'm sorry
your party bombed out.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.206
I'm sorry
you hurt your ankle.

16:16.207 --> 16:17.575
Me too.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.409
When my dad finds out
about this,

16:19.410 --> 16:22.312
I'll never be able to go
to another party again.

16:22.313 --> 16:24.915
Well, maybe we can
hang out together,

16:24.916 --> 16:28.552
'cause I'll never be invited
to another party again.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.956
I'd like
to hang out with you.

16:33.858 --> 16:36.393
You would?
Yeah.

16:36.394 --> 16:38.395
But my dad
probably won't let me

16:38.396 --> 16:41.031
When he finds out I got hurt
on your dad's floor.

16:41.032 --> 16:42.532
Great.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.534
Marge.

16:44.535 --> 16:46.536
Great news.
We can go right now.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.377
Ok. Come with me, honey.

16:54.378 --> 16:57.380
All right.
I'll come back there
and check on you in a minute.

16:57.381 --> 16:58.949
Thank you, marge.

16:58.950 --> 17:02.086
She's gonna be just fine.
They're good here.

17:06.523 --> 17:08.692
Some birthday, huh?

17:08.693 --> 17:10.560
It's the birthday
I always dreamed of -

17:10.560 --> 17:14.164
Sitting around
with a bunch of bleeding
infected people.

17:19.037 --> 17:22.138
Hey, the day's not over.
Maybe we can salvage it yet.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.307
No. There's no way you can
salvage this one, dad.

17:24.308 --> 17:26.309
I finally find out
michelle likes me,

17:26.310 --> 17:28.578
And now her dad won't let me
hang out with her.

17:28.579 --> 17:31.248
Let me talk to her dad.
He likes <i>tool time.</i>

17:31.249 --> 17:33.216
He's gotta understand
that accidents happen.

17:33.217 --> 17:36.386
Hey, tool man.
Hey, bob.

17:36.387 --> 17:37.655
Hey, bob.
Yeah?

17:37.656 --> 17:40.090
When you put a shine
on a floor like this,

17:40.091 --> 17:42.726
How many coats of wax
do you use, like 16?

17:42.727 --> 17:46.263
One. Only an idiot
would do more than that.

17:57.809 --> 17:59.910
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

18:06.484 --> 18:08.485
Oh, mr. Sanford,
you're early.

18:08.486 --> 18:10.954
Well, after seeing
your husband
in his underwear

18:10.955 --> 18:13.057
And your neighbor
wandering around naked,

18:13.058 --> 18:16.093
I was a little concerned.

18:16.094 --> 18:18.962
But it seems like everything's
under control here.

18:18.963 --> 18:22.365
Here? Right here?
Yeah, everything's
really under control.

18:24.268 --> 18:28.872
Want some cake?
No, but I will take
some punch if you don't mind.

18:28.873 --> 18:30.841
Um, you...

18:32.911 --> 18:36.646
Mm. It's really
very different.
Make it yourself?

18:36.647 --> 18:38.082
Michelle helped.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.917
Oh.

18:39.918 --> 18:43.553
It tastes like
she had a hand in it.

18:43.554 --> 18:46.190
Close.

18:46.191 --> 18:47.925
Where is michelle?

18:47.926 --> 18:49.326
Michelle?

18:49.327 --> 18:51.328
My daughter.

18:51.329 --> 18:54.397
Well, the truth is,
she's had a little accident.

18:54.398 --> 18:56.133
Accident?
No, really, she's ok.

18:56.134 --> 18:58.602
She's gonna be back
from the emergency room...
Emergency room?

18:58.603 --> 19:00.871
See? Look, there she is.
She's fine.
Hi.

19:00.872 --> 19:02.539
Sweetheart,
are you all right?

19:02.540 --> 19:04.174
I'm fine.
It's just a sprain.

19:04.175 --> 19:06.910
It's a mild sprain.
She should be ok
in a couple of days.

19:06.911 --> 19:08.245
How did this happen?

19:08.246 --> 19:10.380
It's the same old story,
you know.

19:10.381 --> 19:13.383
Guy builds dance floor
for son, guy overwaxes,

19:13.384 --> 19:15.018
Girl slips and hurts herself,

19:15.019 --> 19:19.056
Guy feels terrible,
girl's father forgives guy.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.724
Afraid not.

19:20.725 --> 19:23.026
I'm sorry, that's how
the story goes.

19:25.063 --> 19:28.031
Look, mr. Sanford,
it was just an accident.

19:28.032 --> 19:30.300
Like on <i>tool time,</i>
the show you like -
accidents.

19:30.301 --> 19:35.205
I like when the accidents
happen to you,
not to my daughter.

19:35.206 --> 19:36.940
Real smooth, dad.

19:39.543 --> 19:41.578
I should've followed
my instincts.

19:41.579 --> 19:44.581
I shouldn't have let you
stay for the party.
Dad, I'm fine.

19:44.582 --> 19:46.884
I should have taken you
car shopping with me.

19:46.885 --> 19:49.419
What kind of car
did you end up with?

19:49.420 --> 19:54.158
Gremlin? An amc general?
Maybe a hornet?

19:54.159 --> 19:57.627
No. For your information,
I collect muscle cars.

19:59.430 --> 20:00.998
You?

20:00.999 --> 20:02.432
Yeah.

20:02.433 --> 20:05.368
What I'm really looking for
is a '70 gto.

20:05.369 --> 20:08.972
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah.
With a big block?

20:08.973 --> 20:12.075
Of course with a big block.
And I'd love to find
a convertible.

20:12.076 --> 20:15.078
<i>(grunts)</i> oh, yeah.
You're a car guy?

20:15.079 --> 20:18.615
Oh, yeah. I like
to take old pieces of junk
and restore 'em to cherry.

20:18.616 --> 20:21.285
Honey, I think I'm in love.

20:21.286 --> 20:24.587
I won't stand in your way.

20:24.588 --> 20:27.925
I got a '46 ford convertible
I'm trying to retrofit
into a hot rod.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.960
You've got a '46
ford convertible?

20:29.961 --> 20:32.796
I do. Wanna see?
I do.

20:32.797 --> 20:36.300
I now pronounce you
man and car guy.

20:36.301 --> 20:39.136
You want a classic goat,
go with the '69 judge.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.471
Hard to find,
but a great investment.
Oh, yeah.

20:41.472 --> 20:44.341
Well, would you like
to have some cake?

20:44.342 --> 20:46.043
Yeah.
Sure.

20:46.044 --> 20:49.579
Randy, I am so sorry
that your birthday
worked out this way.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.482
If you want, your father
and I can make it up to you

20:52.483 --> 20:54.818
By taking you and a bunch
of your friends

20:54.819 --> 20:56.887
To some kind of concert
or something next weekend.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.723
Why? Is lulu doing
a world tour?

20:59.724 --> 21:02.226
Ha-ha-ha.

21:20.578 --> 21:24.014
That floor's not too slippery.

21:24.015 --> 21:26.649
Just how I like it.

21:29.620 --> 21:32.022
<i>(♪ rock music)</i>

21:32.023 --> 21:33.891
Yeah, yeah.

21:36.460 --> 21:39.162

21:46.004 --> 21:48.838
Yeah. Watch out. Faster.

Ohh...

21:57.648 --> 21:58.748
Yeah! Come on!

22:16.167 --> 22:17.867
Perfect.

22:17.868 --> 22:20.103
So shiny you can
see yourself in it.

22:20.104 --> 22:21.604
Take a look, al.

22:23.641 --> 22:25.208
Whoa!

22:27.511 --> 22:30.447
What kind of wax
did you use on that?

22:30.448 --> 22:32.182
Wash-and-werewolf.

22:33.985 --> 22:36.086
Werewolf?

22:36.087 --> 22:38.221
There wolf.
