WEBVTT

00:04.772 --> 00:08.042
Aw, geez, there's already a line
for the washer?

00:08.076 --> 00:10.211
Yeah, I got stuff in there,
and she's next.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.545
What's the hurry?

00:11.579 --> 00:15.349
Well, Neville and I
haven't really been alone

00:15.383 --> 00:17.185
since Logan's
been staying with him,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.553
and he's coming over
to my place tonight,

00:19.587 --> 00:23.524
and I'm gonna surprise him
with a sexy night.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.294
I made some calls.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.398
Keep your creepy
sex stuff to yourself.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.867
I don't have anything
to whisper about,

00:33.901 --> 00:37.271
but while we're on the subject,
tonight's the night

00:37.305 --> 00:39.673
I'm gonna be sleeping with Nick
for the first time.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.941
Here's what I got going on.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.243
Beat that.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.445
Oh.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.214
Okay.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.182
Funny, right?

00:48.216 --> 00:50.017
Unless he only has to stay
a couple inches away,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.385
and then the joke's on me.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.721
It's interesting

00:53.754 --> 00:55.123
what you think is sexy.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.624
That's the kind of outfit
I'd wear

00:56.657 --> 00:58.959
to haul an old rug
to the dump.

00:58.992 --> 01:01.262
I'm just trying to
lower expectations.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.597
This is the first guy I've slept
with since Ben, and, you know,

01:03.631 --> 01:06.367
first times are almost always
a disaster, right?

01:06.400 --> 01:09.303
Not really.
Not in my experience.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.305
Well, I guess we know
where the problem lies.

01:50.644 --> 01:54.315
It's open.
Enter the pleasure-dome.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.817
I knew that you
would like the blindfolds,

01:56.850 --> 01:58.519
and I paid them extra
not to speak.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.258
What kind of weird-ass crap
is going on here?

02:04.292 --> 02:05.993
Logan.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.595
I didn't know
that you were coming.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.697
Yeah, I caught him
getting into my beer

02:09.730 --> 02:11.665
as I was leaving the house
and had to bring him.

02:11.699 --> 02:12.833
I sent you a text.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.468
My phone is in my pants.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.103
Where's your bathroom?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.938
You don't steal beer.
You just rent it, am I right?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.040
Yeah.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.845
I am <i>so</i> sorry.
This keeps happening.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.181
I know.
We can't have one
romantic night alone.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.982
If it's not Logan,
it's something else.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.684
Things are
about to get better.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.286
Logan's mom is sober now,

02:32.320 --> 02:33.987
and she's moving back
to Lanford.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.358
She asked me for a job,
and if I hire her,

02:37.391 --> 02:40.361
she can get an apartment and
Logan can move back in with her.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.331
Oh, fantastic!
That solves our problem.
Mm-hmm.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.666
I'm so sorry!
I'm being so rude.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.402
Neville,
this is Johan and Gerta.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.137
Oh, hi.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.140
You can't see,
but I'm waving.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.643
But with Helen being
newly sober,

02:55.676 --> 02:57.411
do you think
it's kind of risky to hire her?

02:57.445 --> 03:00.214
No, it's not like
she's a wild woman.

03:00.248 --> 03:03.016
She's actually kind of
a plain, sad-sack type.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.219
Okay, well, then you hire her
right away.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.227
Ah, you are so lucky
to live above the shop.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.496
It's always a dream of mine
to have a bookstore,

03:15.529 --> 03:18.366
as long as no customers came in
and touched my precious books.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.701
Oh, this looks great.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.572
Yeah. Just my way of saying
how fun last night was.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.509
And I-I love the fact that
you didn't dress up.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.110
Oh, was that a shot,

03:30.143 --> 03:31.712
or were you trying
to be sincere?

03:31.745 --> 03:33.847
Hey, I prefer clothes
that are easy to get off.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.183
I once got lost
in a wrap-around dress,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.718
and by the time I found
my way out of it,

03:37.751 --> 03:38.886
the woman was gone.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.222
Oh, dammit.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.258
Oh, what happened?
Oh, it's the fuse again.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.893
This happens
once every couple weeks

03:45.926 --> 03:48.061
'cause the building
is so old.

03:48.095 --> 03:51.432
And, uh, yep,
must've used the last one.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.801
Oh, well, my dad works
at Olinsky's Hardware.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.269
They should be open
in about a half-hour.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.638
Okay, Olinsky's, yeah.

03:57.671 --> 04:02.310
Oh, did-- Uh, didn't you say
your ex owns that store?

04:02.343 --> 04:05.078
Oh, yeah, yeah,
but today's his day off.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.780
Funny how you know
your ex's schedule.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.117
You guys still close?

04:10.150 --> 04:12.720
Oh, my God, no.
I-I can't stand him.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.822
He's always trying to look
like such a nice guy,

04:14.855 --> 04:17.425
like, "Oh, I'll give
your dad a job.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.060
I'll -- I'll watch movies
with your son.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.496
I'll give up my dream of being
a father just to be with you."

04:22.530 --> 04:24.332
Like, what kind of
sick son of a bitch

04:24.365 --> 04:26.099
works that hard
to be a good person?

04:28.201 --> 04:29.670
Yeah, he's clearly
a monster.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.974
Don't pay.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.143
Send a check
but don't sign it.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.479
Sign the check
but don't send it.

04:38.512 --> 04:43.283
Put back in mailbox marked
"not at this address."

04:43.317 --> 04:45.519
And pay.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.521
Next week.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.656
Hey.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.023
Harris,
since you moved out,

04:50.057 --> 04:51.992
a bunch of bills
have piled up for you.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.627
Where?
I don't see them.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.330
Damn post office. You can't
depend on them anymore.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.032
How am I supposed to pay them
if I don't get them?

04:59.066 --> 05:02.836
Man. Sometimes you don't think
you're leaving anything behind

05:02.870 --> 05:04.304
for your grandchildren.

05:04.338 --> 05:07.341
And then you see something
like this, and then --

05:07.375 --> 05:09.042
Don't look at me.
I'm gonna get emotional.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.615
This bedroom furniture
looks great.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.450
Not a bad price.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.719
This might be the stuff.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.287
Louise would hate this.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.790
This is the most traditional,
depressing furniture

05:22.823 --> 05:24.558
I have ever seen.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.027
People with this furniture
are sleeping on rubber sheets

05:27.060 --> 05:30.531
and being turned over
by strangers.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.834
I'll help you pick out some
stuff that Louise will like.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.736
I appreciate the offer,
honey,

05:35.769 --> 05:38.472
but you've got <i>way</i> too much
on your plate already.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.973
Hey, take the help,
Grandpa,

05:40.007 --> 05:41.542
and then I'll help you decorate
the rest of the house.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.411
You get the gas,
I got the match.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.980
Yes, I'm busy,
but this is important.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.316
You need stuff
that's young and fun.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.918
Louise is
a rock 'n' roll girl.

05:50.951 --> 05:54.555
Hey! I want the bedroom
to be fun, too.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.591
There's enough stuff in there
that's old and worn out.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.192
Including you.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.597
I was talking about
the rug and the drapes.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.332
She's on tour

06:05.365 --> 06:08.068
with a bunch of young
rock 'n' roll musicians

06:08.101 --> 06:09.069
right now.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.838
Have you seen
some of these guys?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.673
Let me see.
Boop!

06:12.706 --> 06:15.042
You're so easy.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.513
Since we're here so early,
my dad will probably figure out

06:19.547 --> 06:21.381
that we spent the night
together.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.516
Does that really
bother him?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.717
Oh, no, he'll be excited.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.086
It means there's a chance
I might move out.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.121
Your dad's
not working today.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.857
But I'll be sure
to tell him

06:29.890 --> 06:32.593
that, uh, you are
sleeping with somebody.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.061
Hi. Ben.

06:34.094 --> 06:34.895
Nick.
Awkward to meet you.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.430
Yeah.

06:36.464 --> 06:39.032
I am so sorry.
I thought it was your day off.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.201
We-We'll come back later.
No, no, come on.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.570
Don't worry about it.
You didn't know.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.771
Your dad and I swapped days

06:43.804 --> 06:45.806
'cause I'm moving into
my new place tomorrow.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.708
Oh, wow.
You got a place?

06:47.741 --> 06:51.378
Yeah.
Big day for surprises, huh?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.080
I mean, you didn't expect me to
live in the back of the store

06:53.113 --> 06:55.315
forever, did ya?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.951
Guess you have a type --
guys who live in stores.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.653
How long
were you back there?

06:59.687 --> 07:01.955
Six months.
Mm-hmm.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.725
I only did it 'cause Darlene and
I were going through some stuff,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.994
and I wasn't sure if we were
gonna be living together or not.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.996
Well, obviously "not"
'cause we're estranged.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.464
I mean, I didn't even know
he was getting a place.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.465
I don't even know
where it is.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.466
Don't tell me.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.001
You're no longer
part of my life.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.237
Okay. So, uh,

07:17.270 --> 07:18.906
we're really just here
for one of these.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.741
Oh, yeah.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.943
Hey! Dick Butkus
from the Bears.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.412
Mm-hmm.
Oh, man.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.447
I really miss watching
the Bears' games at the bars.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.982
At least the ones
I can remember.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.251
I used to drink pretty hard
when the Bears won.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.820
Or lost.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.421
Or tied.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.623
Or didn't play 'cause
it was baseball season.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.660
Well, how do you feel about
watching one with her ex?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.529
I'm going to the Lunch Box
tomorrow night.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.996
Think it'd be okay.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.132
I mean, you are estranged.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.467
Great!
Alright, well,

07:47.501 --> 07:51.004
just get rid of the old
ball and chain and come by.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.706
You sell bolt cutters
so I can get away?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.212
Yeah, yeah, just 'cause
he does the joke

07:59.246 --> 08:00.413
doesn't mean you need to.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.155
Hey, Dad.
Hey, honey.
How was class?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.523
Good.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.959
My psychology professor
was going on and on

08:11.992 --> 08:14.795
about how easily people
are distracted nowadays.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.964
And I remembered

08:16.997 --> 08:18.832
you needed
a bedroom set,

08:18.866 --> 08:21.234
so I made this.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.471
It's a design board
for your new bedroom.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.808
See, it has furniture samples
for scale and tone

08:27.841 --> 08:30.143
and brighter accessories
for fun.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.712
Thanks, honey.

08:31.745 --> 08:35.415
I can't believe you found
the time to do that.

08:35.448 --> 08:39.653
Now throw that out and come
take a gander at what I did.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.828
Hi, Mommy.
What do you think?

08:47.861 --> 08:52.332
Honey, why don't you go
play your goldfish game

08:52.365 --> 08:54.034
in the
living room?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.936
And Mommy will
be right in.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.872
Okay.
Okay.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.674
You said cool and fun.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.110
Nothing is
cooler and funner

09:03.143 --> 09:05.613
than an old-school,
full-wave waterbed.

09:05.646 --> 09:09.917
Wow. I didn't realize anybody
was still making this stuff.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.720
And why isn't anybody
stopping them?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.622
There are still artisans
out there

09:14.655 --> 09:18.558
who march to the beat of
their own LSD-fueled drummer.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.427
Lay down.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.896
You sure?

09:22.930 --> 09:25.432
What if
I become too groovy?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.007
Huh?
How cool is that?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.778
Ah, you hate it, right?

09:37.811 --> 09:40.113
No, it's nice.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.782
I didn't realize
how long it's been

09:41.815 --> 09:44.451
since I just
laid down to relax.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.720
Mommy,
the game isn't working.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.088
What happened?

09:48.121 --> 09:50.624
It was dirty, so I washed it
in the toilet.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.128
Well, I got a whole 30 seconds
to myself.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.897
That was restful.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.632
Think I'm gonna do it again
next year.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.803
Yes!
Yeah!

10:04.037 --> 10:05.305
Hi.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.606
Are you Jackie?

10:06.640 --> 10:07.775
Yeah.
How can I help you?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.309
I'm Helen.
Helen?

10:09.342 --> 10:11.344
Logan's mom?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.681
You're Logan's mom,
Helen?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.415
Are you sure?

10:15.448 --> 10:18.652
Unless my C-section was
recreational, then yeah.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.587
Um, I just wanted to bring you
something to say thanks

10:20.620 --> 10:21.989
for helping with Logan.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.791
When I was moving to Lanford,
I found bottles

10:23.824 --> 10:25.258
I hid from myself
when I was drinking,

10:25.292 --> 10:27.494
and now they make
great gifts.
Ah.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.197
Well, it's a shame you weren't
a gambler and hid money.

10:31.899 --> 10:35.135
Um, and thank you for
encouraging Neville to hire me.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.337
I don't think I would've been
that cool with my boyfriend

10:37.370 --> 10:39.406
hiring someone he was
engaged to in college.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.444
Well, some people might've said
I was an idiot,

10:44.477 --> 10:47.347
but I like to rely on
my reputation

10:47.380 --> 10:50.217
as a person who turns
truly dangerous

10:50.250 --> 10:53.320
when someone I've helped
betrays me.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.288
Well, I should get going.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.724
Starting work tomorrow.
Big day.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.625
Ah.
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.160
Oh, yeah, we will.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.696
I drop by the vet clinic
unannounced all the time.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.365
You think I'm not there, and
then all of a sudden, I'm there!

11:07.367 --> 11:08.902
Who was that?

11:08.936 --> 11:10.337
Logan's mom, Helen.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.372
That's a Helen?
That's a Helen?!

11:12.405 --> 11:14.374
Right?
That's not a Helen!

11:14.407 --> 11:17.811
A Helen has arm flaps
and one stray whisker

11:17.845 --> 11:20.714
long enough to reach
one of the arm flaps.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.582
Neville totally
downplayed her.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.084
You know why?

11:24.117 --> 11:26.019
They were engaged
in college.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.756
Okay, but that was
forever ago.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.223
What do you think's
gonna happen?

11:30.257 --> 11:33.326
Come on! They're working
elbow-to-elbow, saving lives.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.195
Passions could reignite.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.864
In a vet clinic?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.598
They're gonna be
elbow-to-elbow

11:38.631 --> 11:41.501
separating a goat
from its testicles.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.671
And then the goat flatlines
and they lose him,

11:44.704 --> 11:47.574
and they have to find comfort
in each other's arms!

11:49.309 --> 11:51.879
Yes, clearly
I didn't think it through.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.782
Well, so,
how'd you guys meet?

11:54.815 --> 11:57.050
Oh, she came into
the bookstore where I work,

11:57.084 --> 11:59.252
and she was
asking questions,

11:59.286 --> 12:01.221
looking for help
on her spiritual journey.

12:01.254 --> 12:05.458
You're on
a spiritual journey?

12:05.492 --> 12:08.561
Yeah, I thought I could use
a little introspection

12:08.595 --> 12:10.030
to change my attitude

12:10.063 --> 12:11.698
and help me
with my relationships.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.701
Oh. Introspection, huh?

12:14.734 --> 12:18.071
Wow. You sure you want to see
what's growing in that cave?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.241
Hey, Nick.
Oh, hey!

12:21.274 --> 12:22.409
Uh, you made it.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.077
Um, Darlene, Ben,
this is Heather.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.278
Hey.
Hi.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.114
I thought I'd invite her
'cause I-I thought

12:27.147 --> 12:28.615
you guys would really
get along.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.251
Well, Nick knows I just
went through a bad breakup

12:31.284 --> 12:33.887
and was sitting
home alone.
Oh, yeah.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.755
Yeah, I've been going through
the same thing.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.624
Hmm. I'm not sure what your
ex-boyfriend put you through,

12:37.657 --> 12:41.228
but my ex was brutal.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.931
Oh, that'd be me.
He's just having a little fun.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.134
I'm actually a very nice person
that just wanted to get married.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.836
Yeah, and --
and Ben's a great guy.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.503
As long as you're not looking
for somebody who takes

12:50.537 --> 12:51.738
marriage and commitment
seriously.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.243
Yeah, you know, I don't ask much
from a relationship.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.512
It's like, be nice, you know,
have a sense of humor,

12:59.546 --> 13:02.182
uh, don't take any dudes
to Hawaii behind my back.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.351
Uh, yeah,
it was platonic.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.486
I didn't take the guy.
I just invited him.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.088
Some people can't move on.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.789
Oh!
You hear that, Heather?

13:09.823 --> 13:11.324
It's all my fault now.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.093
Yeah.
Hey, look at that.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.362
Finally he's taking
a little responsibility.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.097
But don't bring Heather
into it.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.266
She's lonely and just wants
to have a good time.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.801
Right. And you know what'd
help that? Beer.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.539
Hey, now there's a pretty woman
next to Ben.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.908
That can only help.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.210
Pitcher of beer, please.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.479
And a straw.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.547
You know what?
Why don't we get another table

13:34.581 --> 13:36.316
and let these two
get to know each other?
Love it.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.019
Why? Does this make you feel
uncomfortable, Darlene?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.021
I mean, you've moved on.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.223
Why can't Heather and I?

13:43.256 --> 13:45.859
Oh, you absolutely can.
What do you say, Heather?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.394
You wanna waste three years
of your life?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.196
Feels like I just did.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.933
Sorry.
Bye.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.603
Gotta work on your game,
buddy.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.240
Just for the record,
I didn't waste your life.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.508
You wasted mine.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.843
Oh, let's unpack that.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.046
Hey, can we talk
for a minute alone?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.080
Uh, yeah.
Gimme a second.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.681
I just gotta
prove him wrong.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.650
Yeah, you can do that
right after we talk.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.419
Oh, sure.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.254
Don't you go anywhere.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.788
You mean like Hawaii?

14:17.257 --> 14:19.059
Can you believe this guy?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.560
I mean, you see it,
right?

14:20.593 --> 14:24.097
I do. But I don't think
it's what you see.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.566
This might be
the O'Doul's talking,

14:26.599 --> 14:29.336
but I'm pretty sure
you and Ben

14:29.369 --> 14:30.737
still have feelings
for each other.

14:30.770 --> 14:34.174
Oh, God.
Where is <i>that</i> coming from?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.676
I don't know, just every word
you two said to each other.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.078
What?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.847
Look, Darlene,
I really like you.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.716
But we're just starting,
and already there's signs

14:43.750 --> 14:45.852
that you and Ben
aren't over.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.088
I think I should just
step out

14:48.121 --> 14:50.523
and let you guys
work through things.

14:50.557 --> 14:54.594
Wait, so you're --
you're breaking it off with me?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.763
You know, maybe after you and
Ben get married and divorced,

14:56.796 --> 14:58.198
we can revisit this,

14:58.231 --> 15:00.934
but for right now...

15:03.803 --> 15:05.238
...I'm gonna go.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.041
So you --
you can't even handle

15:08.075 --> 15:09.609
a little trash talking?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.278
What happened to
all the Zen nonsense

15:11.311 --> 15:13.146
about going with the flow?

15:13.180 --> 15:15.448
Fine.
Take off, loser.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.185
Okay, I no longer
want to revisit this.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.067
Mm.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.169
These are for you.
Oh.

15:36.203 --> 15:40.740
Is that FTD's
"Lie of Omission" bouquet?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.909
I talked with Helen
at work,

15:42.942 --> 15:45.745
and she told me
that you guys met.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.681
Obviously, when we talked
about me hiring her,

15:48.715 --> 15:52.285
I may have left out
one salient detail.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.486
That you were engaged
to her?

15:53.520 --> 15:56.023
That would be
the one, yes.
Mm.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.758
But I broke it off with her
20 years ago.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.293
And you and I
have our health,

16:00.327 --> 16:01.628
so let's just rejoice
in that.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.430
Well, you have
your health <i>now.</i>

16:03.463 --> 16:05.098
Whether or not that continues

16:05.132 --> 16:06.966
will be based on
your answers

16:07.000 --> 16:08.168
to the following
questions.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.103
Do you still maintain

16:10.137 --> 16:13.673
that Helen is
a plain sad-sack?

16:13.706 --> 16:16.343
Hey, you know what, these
flowers could use some water.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.678
Neville!

16:18.711 --> 16:21.948
How am I supposed to feel
about you working every day

16:21.981 --> 16:24.451
with a woman that you loved
enough to propose to?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.286
But don't love anymore.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.488
The only thing
I need from Helen

16:28.521 --> 16:31.191
is that she knows her way around
an animal's intestinal tract.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.993
Oh, I bet she does.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.728
What is that
supposed to mean?
I don't even know.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.497
I wasn't sure if I was done
being mad or not,

16:37.530 --> 16:39.499
so I just said something.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.469
I swear I will make this
up to you.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.904
But for now, how about you
come out and play two-on-two

16:44.937 --> 16:45.972
with me and the boys?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.374
You can foul me
as much as you want.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.177
I'm not gonna play,
but I'll come watch.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.879
I'm open!

16:55.448 --> 16:58.085
Oh, hey! I hope you don't mind
me coming by.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.852
I got off early and I came
to pick up Logan,

16:59.886 --> 17:01.688
and they insisted
I play a quick game.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.191
No, that's a great idea.
I'm gonna play, too.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.758
She's pretty good.
Yeah.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.060
I'm pretty good, too.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.228
Played a little ball
in high school.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.729
Oh, that's something
we have in common.

17:09.762 --> 17:10.997
I played a little ball
in college.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.832
I was starting forward
when I met Neville.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.767
You and your mom versus me
and your boyfriend.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.536
I guard Helen.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.538
O-kay.
I'll ref so no one

17:18.571 --> 17:20.907
punches someone else
in the face.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.109
I'm open!

17:22.142 --> 17:23.943
Nice D, Aunt Jackie!

17:26.045 --> 17:27.880
Oh. Oh.
Are you okay?!

17:27.914 --> 17:29.749
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.351
Just let me walk it off.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.186
Ooh! Oh!
Okay, just stay down
a minute.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.254
Here. Let me take a look
at your ankle.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.223
No! You're a vet tech.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.990
You don't touch my hocks.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.894
Alright.
Well, just call me

17:41.928 --> 17:44.131
after the doctor
looks at the x-rays.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.068
Listen, I just wanted
to apologize

17:49.102 --> 17:53.473
for stirring things up with
Nick.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.974
Well, you should.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.244
Uh, I mean, you totally screwed
up my relationship with him.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.112
Is it really
a relationship?

17:59.146 --> 18:01.148
You've been on like five dates
with the guy.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.315
What does that have to do
with anything?

18:02.349 --> 18:03.883
I was stupid enough
to fall in love with you

18:03.916 --> 18:05.418
after only like two dates.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.487
That's 'cause I'm fabulous.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.955
Unlike Nick.

18:08.988 --> 18:11.124
I mean, what kind of loser lives
in a store he doesn't own?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.925
Oh, Nick's a loser?

18:12.959 --> 18:14.727
You were such a jerk
that Heather ran out of there

18:14.761 --> 18:16.263
like she was on fire.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.498
Well, I believe that was
more your doing,

18:18.531 --> 18:21.434
unable to let go of things that
happened between us months ago.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.636
Oh, no. I <i>have</i> let go.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.306
That's why it's <i>crazy</i>
that Nick thought

18:26.339 --> 18:28.141
that you and I
were still in love.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.609
That's why
he broke up with me.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.078
He broke up with you?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.646
Yeah.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.189
Why would he say that?

18:42.222 --> 18:45.625
You're not still harboring some
secret feelings for me, are you?

18:45.658 --> 18:49.662
Mm, no. I got nothing left
in the harbor.

18:49.696 --> 18:53.065
It was wiped out by
the hurricane of your deceit.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.369
Yeah, well, I don't either.

18:56.403 --> 19:00.307
I can honestly say that
I hope you find somebody.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.175
Oh, thanks.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.647
Anything you want to
say to me?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.015
Oh, sure, yes.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.318
I can honestly say that

19:11.351 --> 19:13.520
I don't wish you
on anybody.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.291
See, that's why
I'm healthier than you,

19:18.325 --> 19:20.193
because I really <i>do</i>
hope you find somebody

19:20.227 --> 19:22.195
that you truly love.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.497
And that that person gives you
the most virulent strain

19:24.531 --> 19:28.201
of herpes this world
has ever seen.

19:28.235 --> 19:31.871
Oh, man, just knowing
that you care means a lot.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.340
Are you done talking?

19:33.373 --> 19:35.342
'Cause you are giving me
a terrific headache

19:35.375 --> 19:37.210
on top of this hangover.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.412
Well, let me help.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.549
I, uh -- I still remember
your vegan hangover cure.

19:42.582 --> 19:46.586
Now, it's red pepper, garlic,
broccoli, coconut water, right?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.021
Yeah. Thanks.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.590
Uh, don't put too much
red pepper in.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.225
It makes me nauseous.

19:52.259 --> 19:56.296
Yeah, I know exactly how much
red pepper to give you.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.234
Oh.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.336
- How you doing, Jackie?
- All good.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.205
The doctor insisted on the boot
as a precaution,

20:06.239 --> 20:07.707
but I'll be right as rain
by tomorrow.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.376
Okay, great.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.210
Um, the boys want to go to
dinner at Dave & Buster's.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.280
Can you make that?
No, but you go ahead.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.047
Okay.
I'll stay.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.784
No, no. Go ahead.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.219
Well, alright,
but I'll come right back,

20:20.253 --> 20:21.254
and I'll bring you
some dinner.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.723
Okay. I look forward
to the doggy bag.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.960
Wow, you and I
having dinner together.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.162
It's like old times.
Yeah. Hmm.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.473
Wow.
What happened?!

20:40.507 --> 20:42.208
I don't know!
Freakiest thing --

20:42.241 --> 20:43.710
Neville's assistant
ran in here

20:43.743 --> 20:45.912
and broke a vase
and then ran out.

20:52.985 --> 20:53.620
Why are you dragging me
in here?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.155
I've seen the bed,
and it's an abomination.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.924
Because of this.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.496
You're doing so much
for everybody else,

21:03.530 --> 21:06.098
you deserve
a night to yourself.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.067
I'm gonna spend the night
down in the basement

21:08.100 --> 21:11.137
and mind Beverly Rose
so you can just chill.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.241
Oh!

21:15.274 --> 21:17.610
Thanks, Dad.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.359
