00:32.844 --> 00:36.759
Damn! Thatjabberjaw Tuttle's
still watering his lawn.

00:36.849 --> 00:40.266
This is the sixth time
we've circled the block. I have to pee

00:40.353 --> 00:43.854
- and I'm not going in the cup again.
- Tie a knot in it, Francine!

00:43.941 --> 00:48.189
I won't get stuck talking to Mr Sincerely
Wants To Know How You're Doing guy.

00:48.280 --> 00:53.240
- God, his genuine interest makes me sick!
- Come on. He's perfectly nice.

00:53.328 --> 00:57.790
In today's world, perfectly nice
gets you perfectly dead.

01:01.714 --> 01:05.248
Stupid gas guzzler, that I as an American
have a right to drive!

01:05.343 --> 01:08.013
How ya doin'?
Seriously, I genuinely wanna know.

01:08.097 --> 01:12.427
Now's not a good time. I just slammed
my hand in the car door.

01:12.519 --> 01:14.393
You understand. Come on.

01:14.480 --> 01:18.858
- Say hi to Betty for me.
- I would, but she died six months ago.

01:18.944 --> 01:20.688
- The big C.
- Cancer?

01:20.779 --> 01:24.944
No, the big letter C from the Coca-Cola sign.
Fell right on top of her.

01:27.538 --> 01:30.955
Betty died? How did I get so out of touch?

01:31.042 --> 01:33.534
I was friends with everyone on the block.

01:33.629 --> 01:38.423
You still have friends, like the washing
machine, and the family of skillets.

01:38.510 --> 01:44.052
"Honey, are we driving to your sister's
wedding?" "No, we're frying." Get it?

01:44.142 --> 01:46.895
How about a courtesy laugh?
They're your friends.

01:46.979 --> 01:51.274
I wish I could just throw a party
and reconnect with everyone.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.649
- But, of course, I can't.
- Why not?

01:53.738 --> 01:57.404
Because your security clearances
and background checks

01:57.492 --> 02:01.574
make people uncomfortable.
Remember game night with the McLearys?

02:01.664 --> 02:06.909
And that's the last time
I buy prewashed spinach in a bag.

02:07.881 --> 02:10.372
So, Laura, you had an abortion in college.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.757
What?

02:12.845 --> 02:14.885
"Sports and Leisure" for the wedge.

02:14.973 --> 02:19.019
I just wish that for one afternoon
you could stop being CIA guy

02:19.103 --> 02:22.769
and just be a normal husband
so I could have some friends.

02:22.858 --> 02:26.275
Gosh, Francine, I didn't know friends
meant that much to you.

02:26.362 --> 02:30.112
You'll throw that party, and
it'll be the bestest party in the land!

02:30.200 --> 02:33.202
Oh, Stan. Really?
You promise you'll be good?

02:33.288 --> 02:36.206
I'll be better than good.
I'll be fun! Starting now.

02:36.291 --> 02:39.911
I'll be fun in the kitchen!
In the bedroom! In the dining room!

02:40.004 --> 02:44.798
And I'll be fun at Costco when
we're shopping for bulk paper towels!

02:45.261 --> 02:49.758
The alien in this video game is awesome
He shoots laser beams, he levitates.

02:49.850 --> 02:52.342
He's the coolest alien ever.

02:53.396 --> 02:57.894
- Oh, I didn't mean...
- No, you said it. Now we have to live with it.

02:57.985 --> 03:01.605
It's kinda true.
You don't have any special powers, do you?

03:01.699 --> 03:05.234
I'm a good listener.
Know how rare that is in this universe?

03:05.328 --> 03:08.413
Yeah, that'll take down an F-14.
Can't you do anything?

03:08.499 --> 03:13.162
Well, I can get my feelings hurt
and throw a world-class hissy fit!

03:13.255 --> 03:15.746
I wish he'd get sick like ET.

03:16.092 --> 03:19.793
- It's going to be a block party.
- We'll provide burgers and beer,

03:19.888 --> 03:22.806
as long as you provide
your charming selves.

03:22.892 --> 03:25.929
- No cavity search?
- Available on request.

03:26.021 --> 03:28.097
Oh, you!

03:29.233 --> 03:33.149
Well, I'm so proud of you.
You actually are being fun.

03:33.238 --> 03:39.492
Oh, Francine. F-U-N. That spells "fun",
and that's what I am. A guy who spells fun.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.163
- Thatjust leaves the new neighbours.
- New neighbours?

03:43.251 --> 03:46.206
"Memari"? Oh, God!
Tell me they're not Italian.

03:46.296 --> 03:48.966
No, I think they're Iranian.

03:50.218 --> 03:52.971
- Holy Ayatollah!
- Hi. We're your neighbours,

03:53.055 --> 03:56.721
Stan and Francine Smith.
We came to invite you to our block party.

03:56.810 --> 03:59.598
Bob and Linda Memari.
We'd love to come.

03:59.688 --> 04:03.936
Well, maybe some other time.
So, what part of Islam do you hail from?

04:04.027 --> 04:06.697
My parents were from Iran,
I was born in Cleveland.

04:06.781 --> 04:11.278
We also have a Cleveland here in America.
It'd be super if you didn't blow it up.

04:11.370 --> 04:15.119
The block party starts at three
and goes till question mark.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.747
It's pot luck, so bring whatever you want.

04:17.836 --> 04:22.546
But not smallpox! Kidding.
Kind ofjoking, but not really.

04:22.634 --> 04:25.090
Enemies of freedom
are in our neighbourhood.

04:25.179 --> 04:27.931
Your mother is in denial,
but we will be prepared.

04:28.016 --> 04:31.053
That's why I have to join
the dorky Scout Rangers?

04:31.145 --> 04:34.182
The Rangers will teach you
skills you need to survive,

04:34.274 --> 04:37.359
whether the apocalypse comes
in six months or seven.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.482
Ahoy, Rangers!
Is the scoutmaster around?

04:40.573 --> 04:43.575
He stepped out, but my name's Joey.
Can I help you, sir?

04:43.661 --> 04:47.113
My son is soft.
I want you to make him Ranger-rific.

04:47.207 --> 04:51.040
That's good. By the way, that's trademarked.
You can't use that.

04:51.128 --> 04:52.789
Well, good luck.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.386
Stand straight, Ranger.
One day you'll look back on this day and...

04:58.471 --> 05:00.879
OK, Dudley Do-Right's gone.

05:02.768 --> 05:04.726
Hey, Spider. Beer me.

05:09.360 --> 05:13.774
Stan! The party's starting.
You're still planning on being fun, right?

05:13.865 --> 05:17.531
You bet. Just undergoing
a little last-minute funnification.

05:17.620 --> 05:19.245
I think I'm fully strapped.

05:19.331 --> 05:24.373
There might be some room left in the vast
wasteland between your testicles and anus.

05:24.462 --> 05:26.918
<i>Nope, ocupado.</i>

05:27.007 --> 05:29.333
- I gotta go to a Rangers meeting.
- Hold up.

05:29.427 --> 05:31.634
Remember how I taught you Morse code?

05:31.721 --> 05:35.637
If you're ever taken hostage by a neighbour
and end up on Al Jazeera,

05:35.726 --> 05:40.306
just blink your coordinates
in Morse code, like this.

05:40.399 --> 05:43.519
- I'll have a bomb dropped on your location.
- I'd be dead.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.447
There are plenty of kids
in heaven to play with.

05:46.532 --> 05:49.284
<i>Cousin Billy.</i>
The girl from Poltergeist.

05:49.368 --> 05:52.454
She must be 16 by now.
You could totally hit that.

05:56.461 --> 05:59.831
We thought it'd be nice
to get the neighbours together.

05:59.923 --> 06:03.507
- Who's that woman in the tennis dress?
- Karen. Wanna meet her?

06:03.595 --> 06:06.513
I just want Greg to check out
her sun-damaged skin.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.137
That's the kind of leather I want
for the couch.

06:09.227 --> 06:12.394
- Yeah. Nice.
- Hey, Stan. Cheese platter?

06:12.481 --> 06:15.898
I'll just put it over here
on the international table.

06:15.985 --> 06:19.438
- Anyway, glad you could make it.
- Are you frisking me?

06:19.531 --> 06:22.450
Frisking you?
No, this is how white people say hello.

06:22.535 --> 06:24.778
Hey, grab me a beer?

06:24.872 --> 06:27.494
Keep digging. Cold ones are at the bottom.

06:27.583 --> 06:31.712
- What the hell are you doing?
- I like to check orifices for explosives.

06:31.797 --> 06:34.123
It's a quirk. Indulge me.

06:34.217 --> 06:35.925
Not very neighbourly!

06:36.011 --> 06:40.259
- Smith, you are hereby an official Ranger...
- Awesome!

06:40.349 --> 06:43.600
...if you can recite the oath
before the flame hits your hand.

06:43.687 --> 06:46.642
- And show us your penis.
- Dude, we don't do that.

06:46.732 --> 06:51.063
Right. I know. Imagine if we did.
That'd be gay, right?

06:51.155 --> 06:54.489
I promise to mislead,
deceive, beguile, delu...

06:55.327 --> 06:58.494
- No!
- Holy crap, Smith.

06:58.581 --> 07:02.580
- That was awesome!
- That was really cool.

07:02.669 --> 07:05.624
You're one of us now.

07:06.633 --> 07:09.420
- What was that for?
- For being such a good sport.

07:09.511 --> 07:14.590
I don't wanna toot my own horn,
but I think this party's a big hit!

07:14.684 --> 07:18.517
That's enough sangria.
You know, our neighbours are OK.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.979
They're like international Chex Mix -

07:21.067 --> 07:23.820
eat 'em by the handful,
they all taste American.

07:23.904 --> 07:27.108
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
deep down we're all...

07:27.200 --> 07:30.950
- Under attack!
- What? Under attack? Who's attacking us?

07:31.038 --> 07:33.708
The terrorists!

07:33.792 --> 07:36.284
Everyone in your homes, now!

07:39.883 --> 07:42.801
<i>You ruined everything!</i>

07:42.887 --> 07:45.176
<i>Everything?</i>

07:45.265 --> 07:50.853
The hyperbole police are coming to take you
away and lock you up in Exaggeration-traz.

07:50.939 --> 07:54.771
I think I made my point. Eloquent.

07:59.199 --> 08:02.948
I was finally making friends.
How could you ruin my party?

08:03.037 --> 08:06.454
It was easy. I yelled "Terrorists!"
and everyone ran away.

08:06.542 --> 08:09.080
Sorry. I thought you asked
how did I ruin it.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.246
I'm, like, "You were there, baby."

08:11.339 --> 08:17.177
Dad, what you did was racial profiling. The
Memaris had nothing to do with that gazebo.

08:17.263 --> 08:20.135
They're trying to destroy us
and you want proof?

08:20.225 --> 08:23.311
- Yes!
- Well, that's fair. I'll go get some.

08:30.155 --> 08:32.231
Hello. A phone bill.

08:38.123 --> 08:41.374
- Dr Cohen?
- Sure, why not?

08:41.461 --> 08:43.999
Just get comfortable,
and we'll take a look.

08:44.715 --> 08:48.927
Very nice.
I wish Francine kept hers this clean.

08:49.012 --> 08:51.088
What have we here?

08:51.181 --> 08:53.055
- Tic Tacs.
- Doctor!

08:53.142 --> 08:55.515
Why are you going through my purse?

09:03.071 --> 09:07.699
Move. Come on, move! I can't see
their terrorist-related activities.

09:07.785 --> 09:09.862
Dammit!

09:20.051 --> 09:23.172
All I was trying to do
was keep my country and family safe!

09:23.263 --> 09:27.476
I hear ya. All I was trying to do
was keep my little sister safe

09:27.560 --> 09:30.764
by killing her boyfriend
and eating his brain.

09:30.856 --> 09:31.971
Let's be friends.

09:34.486 --> 09:38.070
I must have some special power.
Think, Roger, think.

09:38.157 --> 09:41.159
- The ability to walk through walls?
- I don't know.

09:41.244 --> 09:43.451
You won't know if you don't try.

09:47.461 --> 09:51.791
It's times like this I wish I had a wife
so I could turn to her and say:

09:51.883 --> 09:56.178
"Stop eating bread, you fat pig.
Look at your thighs. You disgust me!"

09:57.181 --> 10:01.844
Burning down the gazebo? Smith,
you have taken us to the next level.

10:01.937 --> 10:06.980
About that. I'm not sure I'm Ranger material.
I'm thinking about hanging up my kerchief.

10:07.069 --> 10:10.273
- No problem.
- Really? I can just quit?

10:10.364 --> 10:15.360
Sure, it's easy.
Just ask the last guy who wanted out.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.659
We're gonna take your skin.

10:22.797 --> 10:25.633
Please stop! I can't take it any more.

10:25.717 --> 10:28.173
- Dad?
- Thank God! Get me out of here!

10:28.262 --> 10:32.213
<i>This psycho is putting on South Pacific</i>
and stepping on all my lines.

10:32.309 --> 10:35.061
You didn't find proof
the Memaris are terrorists.

10:35.146 --> 10:38.231
Listen, Miss Freedom Hater,
they'll strike again,

10:38.316 --> 10:40.523
and I have to get them off the street.

10:40.611 --> 10:45.488
The good news is, in the time I've been
locked up, I realised just how to do that.

10:45.576 --> 10:50.203
Guard! Oh, wait a second.
It's a front hook. I see it. I see it.

10:52.376 --> 10:54.250
- Bob! Linda!
- There they are.

10:54.337 --> 10:59.677
I forgot to tell you. I invited Bob and Linda
for brunch so I could apologise poolside.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.800
Oh, Stan. Thank you.

11:01.888 --> 11:04.806
I've acted horribly to you guys. I'm sorry.

11:04.892 --> 11:07.300
Sorry you're terrorists!

11:11.275 --> 11:13.731
You turned our yard
into a prison camp?

11:13.820 --> 11:17.521
Detention centre. By keeping them here,
they can't strike again.

11:17.616 --> 11:21.946
- You can't do this!
- The United States Patriot Act says I can.

11:22.038 --> 11:27.117
- Let them out. This isn't funny.
- Linda's making a run for the gate.

11:28.171 --> 11:31.089
Come on.
You can't tell me that's not funny.

11:34.888 --> 11:37.676
Ready to talk?
I want your full confession on tape.

11:37.766 --> 11:40.554
- We didn't do anything.
- Terrorist says what?

11:40.645 --> 11:43.018
- What?
- I thought so.

11:43.106 --> 11:46.891
- How could you do this to me?
- It's not always about you, Francine.

11:46.986 --> 11:51.032
What you're doing violates every tenet
of a rational and just society.

11:51.117 --> 11:52.315
High-five!

11:52.410 --> 11:54.783
Steve, I do have powers after all!

11:54.871 --> 11:59.535
I can shoot heat rays out of my fingertips.
Look!

12:01.338 --> 12:05.800
- Hey, is that my dad's sweatshirt?
- I'm having a fat day. What are you doing?

12:05.885 --> 12:09.385
Running away. It's the only way
to escape those psycho Rangers.

12:09.473 --> 12:10.884
Take me with you!

12:10.975 --> 12:16.647
Maybe my special power is keeping you from
getting molested at the bus station. Maybe.

12:16.732 --> 12:20.778
Until you give me details of your next attack,
I'm depriving you of sleep.

12:20.862 --> 12:23.401
- It's two in the afternoon.
- No sleep!

12:23.491 --> 12:26.362
Starting to get uncomfortable, isn't it?

12:26.453 --> 12:30.748
Sure would be nice to feel
the gentle embrace of the sandman's spell

12:30.833 --> 12:34.334
as he warbles his sweet lilting lullaby...

12:37.508 --> 12:40.380
Hayley! The neighbourhood!
Why are you two here?

12:40.471 --> 12:44.386
- Release the Memaris.
- They're human beings. They have rights.

12:44.476 --> 12:48.142
- Why can't you say that to your father?
- I will. This Thanksgiving.

12:48.230 --> 12:53.736
- But only if he's drunk and the Cowboys win.
- Come on! Let's get the Memaris!

12:53.821 --> 12:56.573
Hey, stop! You can't go in there!
That's my house!

12:56.658 --> 12:59.576
Oh! Got boob.
Come on, no trespassing!

12:59.661 --> 13:02.948
Roger, stopping for that burrito
cost us 20 minutes.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.248
Can't run away on an empty stomach.

13:05.335 --> 13:09.381
Taco King.
I think I'm having a delici-gasm.

13:09.465 --> 13:13.381
- Hey, there's Smith! Get him!
- We're dead!

13:14.514 --> 13:16.886
I figured out what my special power is.

13:16.975 --> 13:18.968
- Really?
- Yes, I'm sure of it.

13:19.061 --> 13:21.387
Steve, do you believe in magic?

13:21.481 --> 13:23.059
I do! I do!

13:23.149 --> 13:27.444
Then close your eyes and hold on.
We're gonna fly!

13:39.128 --> 13:42.379
Sorry.
You don't know if you don't try.

13:43.425 --> 13:46.130
I'm gonna lie... I'm gonna lie down.

13:46.220 --> 13:49.388
Hey! Hey! Back off! Back off!

13:49.474 --> 13:55.016
Don't you all get it? Since they've been
locked up, there hasn't been a single attack.

13:55.106 --> 13:59.105
- Oh, no! The power went out.
- Oh, my God! They've struck again!

13:59.195 --> 14:06.445
- The Memaris have been here the whole time.
- They must be part of a larger terrorist cell.

14:07.998 --> 14:10.952
- What are you doing?
- They've recruited others.

14:11.043 --> 14:12.917
They're like vampires! Or gays!

14:13.004 --> 14:17.382
- Could you get any more insane?
- Plug your butt with this clove of garlic!

14:17.468 --> 14:20.470
You can't imprison
the entire neighbourhood! Oh!

14:20.555 --> 14:24.886
Until I figure out who's behind this,
no one's going anywhere.

14:24.977 --> 14:28.597
Let 'em go, Stan!
It's been a fun ride, but it's over.

14:28.690 --> 14:31.229
Come on, Francine. Not this old routine -

14:31.319 --> 14:34.320
you pull a gun,
I pretend I'm gonna do what you want,

14:34.406 --> 14:38.025
then I pull out my gun,
we do our little John Woo stand-off.

14:38.119 --> 14:40.871
Your arm gets tired,
you drop your gun,

14:40.956 --> 14:44.290
and we have "nobody got shot" sex.

14:44.377 --> 14:47.082
Hey! Hey, where are you goi? Francine?

14:47.172 --> 14:50.542
Why did you pull a gun on me
if you didn't want to have sex?

14:52.262 --> 14:56.095
All right, you've found me.
Just tell me what I have to do.

14:56.183 --> 14:59.221
Are you kidding?
Smith, you take things too far.

14:59.312 --> 15:03.477
I mean, the whole electrical grid?
My PlayStation runs on electricity.

15:03.568 --> 15:08.231
- And my Sonicare!
- And Todd's Sonicare. You're out, Smith.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.535
No, no, Steve.
Don't come near this bush.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.874
Pal, that burrito
did a number on my alien stomach.

15:17.961 --> 15:20.535
- Let's just go home.
- Too bad.

15:20.631 --> 15:23.502
I guess I'll never find my special power.

15:36.484 --> 15:40.020
I'll check the transformer.
You'll buy the beers later, right?

15:40.114 --> 15:44.907
Can't do it, pal.
I gotta work on my toast for your wedding.

15:45.913 --> 15:51.335
Jim, look. Behind this bush.
There's a turd made of solid gold.

15:55.341 --> 15:58.711
And it's studded with diamonds and gems...

15:59.764 --> 16:05.305
We're rich, Jim! Rich!
All of our dreams are gonna come tr...

16:35.642 --> 16:39.308
- Oh, hey, Harlan.
- Jeez, we got a mess here today, huh, Jim?

16:39.397 --> 16:42.315
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
I think it's the transformer.

16:42.401 --> 16:46.020
- Where's Mike?
- He didn't show up for work today.

16:46.114 --> 16:49.531
- That ain't like him.
- Yeah, well, you know Mike.

16:50.578 --> 16:54.411
- Look, Harlan, I gotta get going.
- Yeah, OK. Say hey to Abby.

16:54.499 --> 16:57.335
Yeah, yeah. Sure thing.

16:58.046 --> 16:59.873
Hey! Hey, hold on a second!

16:59.965 --> 17:03.216
- Is there a problem?
- I'll say there's a problem.

17:05.137 --> 17:08.009
You forgot your wrench.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.508
Mondays, right? Thanks.

17:29.126 --> 17:32.461
Jim and Abby can't answer the phone
right now. Leave a message.

17:32.547 --> 17:36.167
Pick up. Something incredible's
happened. It'll change our...

17:36.260 --> 17:39.927
- Hello?
- Who... who is this? Where's Abby?

17:40.015 --> 17:43.302
- Idiot! I told you not to answer.
- Sorry, I forgot.

17:43.394 --> 17:45.684
What? Who is this?

18:12.765 --> 18:15.601
Now, which one of you
is the terrorist mastermind?

18:15.685 --> 18:17.678
You're crazy!

18:19.565 --> 18:23.646
Yeah? Well, you're wet. But at least
in five minutes I'll still be crazy!

18:25.239 --> 18:28.360
Easy on the tequila.
How many shooters are you gonna do?

18:28.451 --> 18:31.157
All I wanted was
to reconnect with the neighbours,

18:31.247 --> 18:34.830
and then your paranoid father
locked 'em up in the backyard!

18:34.918 --> 18:37.836
It's like the world's
worst pool party out there.

18:37.922 --> 18:41.457
Or the world's best theme party.

18:42.427 --> 18:45.346
A terrorist detainment camp theme party?

18:45.431 --> 18:48.718
You don't think we'd really
lock up our neighbours, do you?

18:48.810 --> 18:52.145
Chicken satay, you filthy evildoers?

18:53.942 --> 18:58.819
We've got strawberry margaritas.
Who wants to get bombed?

18:58.906 --> 19:02.193
This is brilliant!
Or should I say "Shock and Awesome"?

19:02.286 --> 19:06.119
"Shock and..."
Sorry, girls. He's taken.

19:06.207 --> 19:09.577
Francine, what the hell are you doing?
No fraternising!

19:09.670 --> 19:15.591
- Can this guy sell sadistic nutjob or what?
- All right, that does it.

19:18.473 --> 19:23.136
Mr Smith? I was down at the transformer
that caused the blackout, and found this.

19:23.229 --> 19:29.103
A clue! And there's a name tag. Now all
we have to do is find this Stan Smith, and...

19:29.195 --> 19:31.402
Wait a minute. That's impossible!

19:31.489 --> 19:36.318
Unless somehow
they brainwashed me to do their bidding!

19:36.412 --> 19:39.118
Good God! I'm the terrorist!

19:39.207 --> 19:43.253
- Have you lost your mind?
- It's the only logical explanation.

19:43.338 --> 19:48.297
Hayley, grab the jumper cables.
I have a prisoner to interrogate.

19:49.136 --> 19:54.725
A patriot and a terrorist are going in there,
and only one of us is coming out.

19:54.810 --> 19:58.856
- So authentic. I love a man that can commit.
- Not this again!

19:58.941 --> 20:02.393
I told you, as soon as my father dies,
I will wear the ring.

20:03.947 --> 20:07.566
Stop! I'm not a terrorist!
I can't even grow a beard!

20:07.660 --> 20:10.234
Please! I have a family!

20:11.540 --> 20:15.206
- To new friends.
- You guys, I have a confession to make.

20:15.295 --> 20:19.708
This wasn't a theme party.
I was just covering for Stan.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.170
We know.
We've encountered people like him before.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.303
- You have?
- Oh, sure.

20:25.391 --> 20:29.306
I gotta say, even though Stan's
a suspicious, xenophobic vigilante,

20:29.396 --> 20:32.766
he's still a hundred times better
than our last neighbours.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.851
They were black.

20:34.944 --> 20:38.563
Stan, there's a party going on.
Can't you take a break?

20:38.657 --> 20:41.279
- Not until I crack!
- Stan, hold it.

20:41.369 --> 20:45.783
I know I've been giving you a hard time
for scaring away all my friends.

20:45.875 --> 20:49.956
But I've got to say,
this is the greatest party I've ever thrown.

20:50.047 --> 20:52.123
And I have you to thank for it.

20:52.216 --> 20:56.001
I know it's not easy,
being married to a CIA man.

20:56.096 --> 20:59.347
It's got its advantages.
But let's make a deal.

20:59.434 --> 21:02.685
From now on, you protect the world
from terrorists,

21:02.771 --> 21:05.524
and I'll protect the neighbourhood from you.

21:05.608 --> 21:10.271
- Here's our hosts! Smile, you two.
- No, no! I look terrible!

21:10.364 --> 21:12.856
That's my guy.
