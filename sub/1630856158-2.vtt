WEBVTT

00:21.563 --> 00:23.857
Get out of the way! Move.

00:23.857 --> 00:24.900
Oi!

00:38.789 --> 00:39.790
What the fuck?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.001
River, you have to do exactly as I say.

00:44.086 --> 00:47.130
- You've got Catherine?
- I don't know anything about Catherine.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.385
If you hurt her, you know I'll kill you.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.804
I was just told to come here
and give you a message.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.433
- That's bullshit.
- Please.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.354
They've just sent me a picture
of my sister with her kids at the swings.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.774
- Who did?
- I don't fucking know, okay?

01:05.774 --> 01:08.944
But I have to do what they say, or they'll
kill the kids in front of their mother.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.321
These are bad people, River-- Please--

01:11.321 --> 01:12.656
Look, I'm a shit and I'm a prick,

01:12.656 --> 01:15.909
and I don't blame you for hating me,
but these are kids, River.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.453
They're gonna kill kids.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.792
Well, they're gonna kill Catherine
as well. So, who are they?

01:23.792 --> 01:26.795
How many times-- I don't know.
I'm not in the Service. You tell me.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.801
They want you to get this.
I wrote it down.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.268
The PM's vetting file?
You know where that is, right?

01:41.268 --> 01:43.020
Course I know where it is.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.272
Well, then you know I can't get that.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.025
- No, you have to get it.
- No, it's impossible.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.485
No one gets into that part of the Park.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.446
- You have to get it.
- Even if I could get in, I'd never--

01:52.446 --> 01:53.572
You have to get it by midday.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.991
Mi-- An hour?

01:56.575 --> 01:59.494
Or my nephew, my niece, my sister,
Catherine, they are all gonna die.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.584
- No, I need more time.
- Oh, come on. You have to try!

02:06.376 --> 02:08.503
- Please--
- Okay.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.300
- Who do I even give it to if I get it?
- I don't know.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.219
I just-- I don't know.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.179
They just said they'd make contact again
at midday.

02:18.889 --> 02:22.392
- Why didn't they just get you to get it?
- I'm not in the Service anymore.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.310
You know that.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.771
And I'm in Slough House,
which you love reminding me of.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.440
Yeah, but you don't belong
in Slough House. Everyone knows that.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.567
Maybe they do too.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.989
Maybe they want you because you're--
Fuck's sake--

02:36.532 --> 02:37.950
Because you're special.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.328
That you're the only person
who can pull this off.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.127
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.965
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.511
Oh, Jesus.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.307
River, please, go. Run. Now.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.936
Please, don't let 'em kill me. Please--

03:05.936 --> 03:07.521
Fuck. All right, fine.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.023
Please.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.448
What are you doing?

03:19.992 --> 03:21.910
What are you doing? River!

03:27.499 --> 03:28.750
Oh, fuck.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.687
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

04:44.076 --> 04:45.202
Move!

04:46.662 --> 04:48.121
Thank you. Excuse me. Sorry.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.584
Move. Sorry. Excuse me. Thank you.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.962
- Can you just--
- What's the hurry, mate?

04:56.547 --> 04:57.548
Sorry.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.716
Move!

05:17.651 --> 05:20.904
Let me in. Come on.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.496
Come on.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.796
I need to speak to your head of security.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.090
There's a queue.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.510
Get him on the phone now.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.388
That doesn't even
get you into the building.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.851
God, I've missed you.

05:54.605 --> 05:55.606
Phone off.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.358
I said off!

05:58.358 --> 05:59.443
Yep, one minute.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.863
Off.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.388
He's here, sir.

06:34.019 --> 06:34.853
Thanks.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.651
You fucking me around?

06:40.651 --> 06:42.945
- No.
- So, this isn't bullshit?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.698
- Have you got somewhere else to be, River?
- No.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.661
No, it's not bullshit
and no, don't have anywhere to be.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.539
I don't want you here any longer
than necessary, you fucking Jonah.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.165
- Understood.
- Hey!

06:55.165 --> 06:59.002
That seat there is
for proper fucking grown-up spies.

06:59.002 --> 07:03.757
Spies who don't crash Stansted
or call in fake fucking Code Septembers.

07:03.757 --> 07:08.637
Look, I get the impression sometimes
that you don't like me.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.850
I'd like to see
you eaten feet first by pigs.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.727
Well,
you have a very eclectic bucket list.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.145
But this is not bullshit.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.443
You have the diamond?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.214
You're welcome. See ya.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.299
Wait.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.178
- How did you get it?
- What?

07:50.095 --> 07:52.139
There were only three people on that roof.

07:52.723 --> 07:56.226
Standish, Longridge, Guy. Not you.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.273
I mean, look,
obviously the person that's taken it,

08:01.273 --> 08:04.318
they've acted impulsively,
and they've regretted it.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.654
- Which one was it?
- I don't know, Duffy.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.699
It was left on my desk
with a note to return it to you.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.534
Did you bring the note?

08:12.534 --> 08:14.912
No. And you can't tell who it is
from the note anyway.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.663
No, obviously you can't.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.417
You've got your diamond back.
That's what's important, okay?

08:20.417 --> 08:21.502
Wait.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.965
Let's go and see if this one's genuine,
shall we?

08:27.925 --> 08:30.719
- Why would it not be genuine?
- I don't know, River. You tell me.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.514
- Look, it was handed to me...
- Yeah.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.265
...and I handed it to you.
That's all I know.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.893
Well, let's go and find out together then,
shall we?

08:39.144 --> 08:40.645
Do I need to come for that? Why?

08:40.645 --> 08:43.649
You said that you didn't have
anywhere else to be, River.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.818
Yeah, okay, let's go.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.994
River, if you are fucking me around,

08:56.620 --> 09:00.082
I'm gonna punch you
so hard you'll shit teeth.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.966
Standish hasn't shown in the morgues
or the hospitals.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.469
Someone's grabbed her.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.765
She contacted Cartwright,
or he said she did before he scarpered.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.059
- Well, where is he?
- No idea.

09:19.852 --> 09:21.478
- Well, call him.
- I tried.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.815
His phone's off,
which means I can't track him either.

09:24.815 --> 09:29.319
Jesus Christ, you lot are
about as much use as a paper condom.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.072
Where are Little and Large?

09:33.615 --> 09:36.076
- Do you know what's in that?
- Yes.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.913
Ice cream, sauce, whipped cream,
marshmallows. It's why I bought it.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.416
There's enough calories in there
for a week.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.085
I burn them off. I know it's harder
to keep the weight off at your age.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.505
Look, we might not be
each other's first choice,

09:48.505 --> 09:49.840
but it is just you and me.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.967
We share an office, is all.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.553
Yeah, and River and Louisa
have got the other one.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.597
Ho is his own thing.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.725
And Lamb and Standish
are in some twisted codependency.

09:59.725 --> 10:02.561
So, maybe we should team up.

10:03.645 --> 10:04.855
To do what?

10:04.855 --> 10:06.315
Get out of Slough House.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.817
Unless you wanna stay there forever.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.488
I've got time to take stock,
consider my options, unlike you.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.866
I'm only five years older than you.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.536
Lamb.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.873
Has Standish reached out
to you or Shirley?

10:22.873 --> 10:24.666
No. We'd have let you know if she had.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.002
I'm not sure you would,
seeing how's you slacked off

10:27.002 --> 10:28.295
for an ice cream.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.964
Get back here. She's been kidnapped.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.471
- He said she's been kidnapped.
- Who by? What do they want?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.681
He didn't say.
He wants us back straightaway.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.267
How did he even know we were here?

10:42.267 --> 10:44.061
Yeah, that's definitely what I'd focus on.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.564
Standish's been kidnapped and what?
You just processed that and moved on?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.107
Come on. If he knows we're here,

10:49.107 --> 10:51.235
he probably knows
we haven't started moving yet.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.612
God, we're gonna get a triple bollocking.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.073
Ho must have tracked our service phones.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.700
He's probably got cameras
in our toilets at home too.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.953
Yeah,
I'm gonna need you to slap him again.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.293
- Is this gonna take long?
- You said you had nowhere to be.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.712
Well, by nowhere,
I meant Slough House, of course.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.381
- Cartwright?
- So-- Ma'am.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.757
What are you doing in here?

11:13.757 --> 11:15.843
He's returning the missing diamond, supposedly.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.345
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.431
I've returned the missing diamond, actually.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.475
And I'm taking him to get it examined
and verified.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.894
You can do that by yourself.
I need to talk to Cartwright.

11:25.894 --> 11:30.232
Ma'am, technically you no longer have
oversight of me or the Dogs.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.610
I still have oversight of the Slow Horses.
Lucky me.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.070
Come on, Cartwright.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.989
I want you back in my office
when she's done with you.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.366
If I have to come looking,
it's not gonna be pretty.

11:40.868 --> 11:41.869
Ma'am.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.332
I don't want you in this building ever.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.334
You are the bane of my career.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.670
When you show up,
frogs start raining from the sky

11:51.670 --> 11:53.463
and blood pours from the taps.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.176
- I was returning the missing diamond.
- I don't care about the diamond.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.178
The fact that it was missing
made Duffy look like a fool,

11:59.178 --> 12:00.679
which I was rather enjoying.

12:00.679 --> 12:03.765
Until you messed that up
like you mess everything up.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.518
- Well, I didn't mean to mess anything up.
- Shut up.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.228
- Because of your rolling disasters...
- Yep.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.231
...I have been put in charge
of moving boxes around.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.193
And you and the other quarter-wits
at Slough House

12:14.193 --> 12:15.944
are making a meal out of even that.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.947
- Well, it is a lot of boxes, to be fair.
- I don't want excuses.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.450
I want you to never have happened.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.995
- Feels like I should go. Yeah.
- Yes.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.955
Keep walking until you get to the sea.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.333
And when you get to the sea,
keep walking with your mouth open.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.417
You know the way out.

13:09.331 --> 13:10.707
Hey.

13:13.168 --> 13:16.338
- Hi?
- Hey, this is weird, isn't it?

13:16.338 --> 13:17.464
Yeah.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.176
- I am not sure why I stopped.
- Me neither.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.178
- Do you wanna grab a drink?
- No, thank you.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.682
No, yeah. Fair enough.
Well, I'll see you around then.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.267
Unlikely.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.103
Unless I give you my number.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.106
Do you remember
that I kicked you out of my flat?

13:34.690 --> 13:38.360
Yeah. I guess I was just hoping
we might part on better terms.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.904
Look, I know you think I'm a dick.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.573
I am.

13:43.866 --> 13:47.202
But probably not as much of a dick
as you think.

13:48.078 --> 13:51.248
Look, I'm just-- I'm not really
in a good place at the moment,

13:51.248 --> 13:54.918
so it's possible
I slightly overreacted and...

13:57.462 --> 13:58.463
Hey!

14:02.009 --> 14:04.178
Excuse me, why are you taking this?

14:04.178 --> 14:06.763
It's double yellow lines. Is it yours?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.682
- No.
- It's not your business then.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.518
Actually, it is.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.897
You make that yourself?

14:14.897 --> 14:17.024
I'm MI5,
and I need to look inside this car now.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.108
Yeah, all right.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.152
Stupid cow.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.294
- Oi!
- What the fuck are you doing?

14:38.879 --> 14:39.963
Easy.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.048
Fucking mad.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.846
Oi.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.681
I'll fucking have you for that.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.816
Next time, just do as you're asked.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.418
- She's been kidnapped?
- Yeah, that's what Lamb's saying.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.170
By who? What do they want?

15:20.838 --> 15:22.464
You'd have to ask Cartwright.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.384
He got a message,
supposedly from Standish,

15:25.884 --> 15:28.303
then he ran out like a whippet
with a chili up its arse.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.223
- What's Lamb doing about it?
- More than you two.

15:32.391 --> 15:35.894
I watched you come in
in case you were being followed.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.855
- Save you the bother.
- We'd have known if we had.

15:37.855 --> 15:42.192
Nah. Yeah, there was no one on you,
as it happens, but these people are good.

15:43.569 --> 15:46.363
I think they're out there. Call 999.

15:46.947 --> 15:50.284
Give 'em the address and tell them that
there's some guy out here on the street,

15:50.284 --> 15:52.077
waving his dick at passersby.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.876
They followed Standish from here to AA.

15:58.876 --> 16:03.505
And they knew that Cartwright was gonna
be here when they contacted him.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.883
So, they probably have
the whole building under surveillance

16:05.883 --> 16:07.509
and a tap on the phones.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.846
Get out there. Tail anyone who moves
from the café to the bus stop opposite

16:10.846 --> 16:12.723
the minute after the call goes in.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.016
How long should we follow for?

16:14.016 --> 16:17.311
Well, until we can work out who they are
and what they want.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.523
Keep your distance.

16:21.523 --> 16:22.858
Police, please.

16:22.858 --> 16:25.235
Yeah, I'm at 152 Aldersgate Street.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.322
There's a man outside with his dick
in one hand and a gun in the other,

16:28.322 --> 16:30.365
shouting about God telling him to kill.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.331
Should hurry them up.

16:46.632 --> 16:47.633
Not even close.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.857
This is Duffy.
Is Cartwright still in the building?

17:06.527 --> 17:07.528
Fuck!

17:21.375 --> 17:22.376
Come in.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.296
Ma'am.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.591
Where'd Cartwright
go after you spoke to him?

17:30.175 --> 17:31.677
Don't know. He left the building.

17:32.636 --> 17:35.138
Well, he hasn't left the building.
We've no idea where he is.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.266
That's not good.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.351
Who signed him in?

17:41.436 --> 17:42.271
I did.

17:43.772 --> 17:44.815
Oh, dear.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.068
And the diamond?

17:52.447 --> 17:53.532
Ma'am.

18:02.374 --> 18:05.419
God, it's been so hectic. I even forgot
my parent's wedding anniversary.

18:05.419 --> 18:06.336
Oh, my God.

18:06.336 --> 18:10.132
Luckily my brother said I could go in
on a present with him. Lifesaver.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.483
River fucking Cartwright.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.949
Last time we was by a lift, you twatted me
in the face with a fire extinguisher.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.534
Yeah, well, sorry about that.

18:37.534 --> 18:41.496
But you were trying to nick me
for something I had no part in.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.001
Funny.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.341
Fair play, mate. You got the drop on me.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.259
Gotta respect that, innit?

18:54.760 --> 18:55.719
Yep.

18:56.220 --> 19:00.182
So, what the fuck are you doing
over here? Still a Slow Horse?

19:01.141 --> 19:04.186
Still stink the place up like a dead horse
full of horse shit?

19:05.729 --> 19:09.107
Yeah, well, that's actually why I'm here.

19:09.107 --> 19:13.529
I'm giving a lecture to new recruits
on how not to end up in Slough House.

19:15.739 --> 19:16.990
Don't be a twat.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.868
That's not me saying I don't believe you.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.663
That's me saying that your lecture
on how not to end up in Slough House

19:22.663 --> 19:25.207
should just be you saying,
"Don't be a twat,"

19:25.207 --> 19:27.501
over and over again for an hour.

19:27.501 --> 19:32.381
Right. I mean, I'm probably
gonna flesh it out a bit more than that.

19:32.381 --> 19:36.468
But if it's any consolation,
that's pretty much the gist. Yeah.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.638
Well, glad there's no hard feelings.

19:39.638 --> 19:43.642
No, mate. Now you're over there,
and I'm over here.

19:43.642 --> 19:46.478
And I would rather drown in my own piss
than swap places with you.

19:47.271 --> 19:48.272
Exactly.

19:50.524 --> 19:51.733
Actually, you know what?

19:54.403 --> 19:55.779
I don't want to miss a solid hour

19:55.779 --> 19:58.115
of you telling the new recruits
what a fuckwit you are.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.617
Is that all right?

20:01.410 --> 20:02.494
How could I say no?

20:36.111 --> 20:39.031
Prick in baseball cap. Bus stop.

20:39.031 --> 20:43.702
<i>And don't spook them.
They could lead us to Standish.</i>

20:59.259 --> 21:00.427
What the fuck are you doing?

21:00.427 --> 21:03.555
Following from in front.
It's way more subtle.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.224
And don't fucking call me.

21:05.224 --> 21:07.559
Don't fucking answer
if you don't wanna speak.

21:24.952 --> 21:25.953
Fu--

21:25.953 --> 21:28.497
- Keep on him. I'll try and cut ahead.
- All right. Fuck.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.295
Oi! Little fucker.

21:36.672 --> 21:37.673
Fuck.

21:53.564 --> 21:56.066
- For fuck's sake.
- Nice one.

22:09.872 --> 22:10.873
Fuck.

22:15.919 --> 22:16.920
F--

22:39.359 --> 22:40.360
Fuck.

22:47.409 --> 22:53.248
I told you to keep your bloody distance,
not scare him off like a pigeon.

22:54.625 --> 22:55.834
I got the plate.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.254
Lamb.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.257
Yeah, I need to do some laundry.

23:07.262 --> 23:08.263
Yep. So...

23:14.353 --> 23:15.771
What time did you say it starts?

23:17.064 --> 23:19.650
In the next ten minutes. Yeah.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.947
Wait. Hold on.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.574
Starts at 1:00, not 12:00.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.743
- A shame.
- Yeah.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.328
Gotta be somewhere at 1:00.

23:32.287 --> 23:35.290
Well, I'm sure
someone's gonna record it, so...

23:35.290 --> 23:36.500
I do hope so.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.586
Need something new to wank over.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.679
Yeah. Well, I'll probably just,
you know, stay here.

23:49.763 --> 23:52.099
Get my thoughts together, you know?

23:53.517 --> 23:55.102
Try and forget about what you just said.

23:55.102 --> 23:57.938
Yeah, man. You do that.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.153
Just before I go...

24:07.114 --> 24:08.866
Show us your security pass?

24:10.742 --> 24:12.369
My security pass? You know I'm Service.

24:12.369 --> 24:15.080
No. You're a Slow fucking Horse,

24:15.080 --> 24:17.499
which means
you need a security pass to be in here.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.880
Yeah. They gave me one.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.550
That's a visitor's pass.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.135
That'll get you through reception,

24:28.677 --> 24:32.514
but to be this deep in the building,
you needed a security pass.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.936
Yes. Got it on my phone.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.862
- Show us. Yeah.
- You wanna see it? Okay.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.406
You run the plates?

24:49.406 --> 24:50.782
It's fake.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.201
Why Lamb didn't stop to get it.

24:52.201 --> 24:53.660
Where did he disappear to then?

24:54.161 --> 24:56.914
- He's got nothing to go on.
- Can we find out who faked the plates?

24:57.831 --> 25:01.335
There's about 500 people
on the dark web who offer that service,

25:01.335 --> 25:03.378
and they won't know who they sold it to.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.714
Why am I having to explain this?

25:06.298 --> 25:09.801
This must be how Jesus felt,
surrounded by dickheads.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.304
Yeah, he was famously hated
by everyone who met him.

25:15.098 --> 25:18.352
A hire car was left outside the café
where Catherine was snatched.

25:18.352 --> 25:20.938
Those are the details
of the guy who hired it.

25:20.938 --> 25:24.608
What, you think the kidnapper
signed their real name and address?

25:25.275 --> 25:26.610
Sean Donovan.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.820
Well, it's something to go on, isn't it?

25:28.820 --> 25:30.656
That's nothing to go on, babes.

25:32.199 --> 25:33.367
Is that the van?

25:33.367 --> 25:35.118
Shut up about the fucking van.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.621
You should be tracking it.

25:38.205 --> 25:39.665
I am tracking it.

25:39.665 --> 25:42.960
But after you spooked them, they'll have
swapped the fake plates for a new set.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.044
Well, what's that ping then?

25:44.044 --> 25:46.380
Cartwright. He turned his phone on.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.966
- Where is he?
- The Park.

25:49.466 --> 25:52.219
Oh, fucking come on, mate.
You haven't got a pass, have you?

25:52.219 --> 25:57.182
Yes, I do, I just had a few tabs open
there that I should've shut.

25:57.182 --> 25:59.351
Here it is. Right, there you are.

26:06.108 --> 26:08.986
You fucking bastard!

26:23.292 --> 26:24.877
<i>Cartwright's at the Park.</i>

26:24.877 --> 26:26.628
What the fuck is he doing at the Park?

26:26.628 --> 26:29.298
He's about as welcome there
as a turd in a hot tub.

26:29.298 --> 26:30.465
Search me.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.925
Did he sign in?

26:31.925 --> 26:34.428
Yeah. And now he's AWOL in the building.

26:37.139 --> 26:39.016
Name and address check out.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.852
- Yeah, right.
- Let's see who this is.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.479
- We'll stake out the address.
- Yeah.

26:44.479 --> 26:46.648
- Wait, it's my lead.
- Not a lead.

26:47.441 --> 26:49.026
Please don't leave me with Ho.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.617
Still think it's a fake ID?

26:58.577 --> 26:59.661
So I made a mistake.

27:00.579 --> 27:01.872
I'm vulnerable.

27:20.057 --> 27:21.058
No.

27:22.184 --> 27:23.227
That bad, hey?

27:24.228 --> 27:25.479
They got Standish.

27:27.773 --> 27:29.816
- You didn't tell me that.
- I didn't tell you anything.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.485
They bugged our phones.

27:31.985 --> 27:34.488
- They trail you here?
- Eh, I got rid of 'em.

27:36.657 --> 27:38.283
Why are you talking to me
and not the Dogs?

27:39.910 --> 27:44.164
They made contact with one of my team,
who's just flashed up at the Park.

27:44.164 --> 27:48.168
I'm guessing they told him to do
as they say or Standish turns up in bits.

27:48.168 --> 27:50.963
I'm keen not to accelerate that process.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.549
- What can you give me?
- They're ex-military.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.467
You can tell that by looking?

27:55.467 --> 27:58.262
Oh, yeah, they walk around like they got
a bayonet stuck up their arse,

27:58.262 --> 28:01.723
and spend three hours a day in the gym,
which means their clothes don't fit.

28:02.307 --> 28:05.018
- So mercs?
- No. Mercs are fucking lunatics.

28:05.018 --> 28:08.730
No, these guys,
they're organized, controlled.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.107
Private security then?

28:15.571 --> 28:19.199
Who's big enough to try
and penetrate the Park?

28:20.450 --> 28:22.911
There are three firms that can mount
that kind of op.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.496
Stormbreak and Strike Force--

28:24.496 --> 28:27.457
Jesus Christ. Fucking names.

28:27.457 --> 28:29.960
Why don't they just go for
Rock Hard Cocks?

28:31.545 --> 28:33.881
Well, Stormbreak's guys are
all tied up in Syria.

28:33.881 --> 28:37.718
And I know for a fact that Strike Force
are about to take out a Liberian warlord.

28:37.718 --> 28:38.844
Because?

28:38.844 --> 28:40.470
I'm doing the logistics.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.763
What's the third option?

28:41.763 --> 28:44.433
Chieftain. New dicks on the block.

28:45.267 --> 28:47.394
Ran by a Sly Monteith.

28:47.394 --> 28:50.230
I hate to judge a person
on their name alone,

28:50.230 --> 28:52.441
but he sounds like an absolute ponce.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.695
Old Etonian, well-connected,
went to school with half the Cabinet.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.239
Well, my judgment stands.

28:59.239 --> 29:02.117
Yeah. Now he's living his wet dream
of having his own private army.

29:02.117 --> 29:05.704
But a hell of a move for him to make,
to kidnap and blackmail Service agents.

29:05.704 --> 29:07.372
I mean,
who's gonna pay for him to do that?

29:07.372 --> 29:09.166
Other than a hostile foreign power,

29:09.166 --> 29:11.376
which would land him
in all sorts of shit back here.

29:13.712 --> 29:15.172
I can think of someone.

29:18.509 --> 29:20.385
Oh, for fuck's sake.

29:23.639 --> 29:24.681
Yep.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.738
Cartwright's on east stairs.

29:40.948 --> 29:43.951
Yeah, I'm on the fucking east stairs,
and he's heading to the fucking basement.

29:52.626 --> 29:53.877
Don't even think about it.

30:00.843 --> 30:02.010
Move!

30:03.178 --> 30:04.304
Fuck.

30:08.475 --> 30:09.810
Fuck.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.314
Oh, fuck.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.036
Come here, you bastard.

30:32.207 --> 30:34.334
- Open the fucking door.
- Hello?

30:34.334 --> 30:35.627
Cartwright, I'm so serious.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.504
- Open this fucking door!
- Hello?

30:37.504 --> 30:39.173
- If you don't open the fucking door...
- Hey.

30:39.173 --> 30:40.883
- ...I am gonna kick your head in.
- Hello?

30:45.012 --> 30:46.263
Duffy, Hobbs.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.391
Cartwright's in the basement. He's...

30:50.809 --> 30:54.563
He's jumped me and he's took me pass.
Anyway, I can't get in that room.

30:54.563 --> 30:56.315
No, the fucking troll not letting me in.

30:59.985 --> 31:01.111
Are you a Dog?

31:01.945 --> 31:04.323
No. There's one of them behind that door.

31:04.323 --> 31:06.283
- Then keep him there.
- Fine by me.

31:06.283 --> 31:10.204
Right, I need this now,
or someone dies, okay?

31:10.704 --> 31:12.581
You're Cartwright Jr., aren't you?

31:12.581 --> 31:15.083
- Yeah.
- I can see your grandfather in you.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.376
I need this. Come on.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.545
I can't possibly give you this.

31:19.129 --> 31:21.798
Well, you need to because if you don't--

31:21.798 --> 31:25.302
See this woman? She dies. Okay?

31:25.302 --> 31:26.970
Then I'm afraid she dies.

31:28.138 --> 31:31.391
What? Are you f-- She's Service.
They're gonna fucking kill her.

31:31.391 --> 31:34.228
I didn't much like your grandfather.

31:34.228 --> 31:37.523
But I like him more than I like the Dogs.

31:37.523 --> 31:40.526
If I let you walk out of here
with this file,

31:40.526 --> 31:44.363
the Dogs will work you over
till you're in a chair like mine,

31:44.363 --> 31:46.573
and she'll probably die anyway.

31:47.157 --> 31:52.287
But I will call someone
who might be able to help you.

31:52.287 --> 31:55.874
Okay, well, whoever it is, they have three
and a half minutes to help me. So...

31:56.875 --> 31:59.795
Fuck it. I--
Fuck it, I don't have time for this.

31:59.795 --> 32:02.339
Just give me the file.
Fuck it, I'll find it.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.565
Oh, shit, she's dead.

32:20.148 --> 32:22.526
Fuck. Oh, Catherine.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.198
Cartwright, phone, now.

32:32.369 --> 32:33.370
What--

32:34.204 --> 32:35.205
Yeah, what?

32:35.205 --> 32:37.374
<i>Get the fuck outta there now.</i>

32:37.374 --> 32:39.501
What, why? Lamb, listen to me.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.712
<i>Someone has Standish,
and I have to get a file,</i>

32:41.712 --> 32:43.755
- <i>or they kill her.</i>
- No. You listen to me.

32:43.755 --> 32:48.051
You might think you're hot stuff,
Cartwright, but in fact, you're cold shit.

32:48.051 --> 32:50.387
Lamb, did you hear what I said?
Standish dies.

32:50.387 --> 32:55.142
No, she doesn't. Now get the fuck
out of there before you screw us all.

32:59.855 --> 33:03.317
What does that mean?
What do I do? What the fuck do I do?

33:03.317 --> 33:06.528
- Whatever Lamb told you to do.
- He told me to get out.

33:07.029 --> 33:10.574
There's a service hatch at the back.
It leads to the car park.

33:10.574 --> 33:14.077
I won't have the Dogs on my floor,
so you have some time.

33:19.625 --> 33:20.626
What if he's wrong?

33:21.335 --> 33:23.420
It would be a first.

33:25.255 --> 33:26.256
Oh, fuck.

33:28.675 --> 33:29.676
Fuck.

34:07.130 --> 34:09.382
The last time I saw you,
you put a gun to my head.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.592
Now you're offering me room service?

34:11.592 --> 34:13.428
We needed the photo to look real.

34:13.428 --> 34:14.847
Who did you send it to? Lamb?

34:14.847 --> 34:17.099
'Cause if you're trying to blackmail him
with a threat to me,

34:17.099 --> 34:19.476
- I'm not sure it'll work.
- We need to move you.

34:19.476 --> 34:21.478
You have about 20 minutes to finish that.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.480
If you want anything else,
please let us know.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.232
I'd like to go home, please.

34:26.692 --> 34:30.737
I wasn't sure if you're a vegetarian,
so there's one ham, one cheese.

34:32.531 --> 34:34.241
And what is this place?

34:34.241 --> 34:38.871
I mean, safe houses are usually empty,
impersonal. This house feels lived in.

34:41.581 --> 34:45.627
Or you could combine them. Ham and cheese.

35:00.267 --> 35:04.438
A rental car was towed from outside
the café where Catherine was snatched.

35:04.438 --> 35:07.733
And the rental doc was filled out
in the name of Sean Donovan,

35:07.733 --> 35:10.235
- who works for Ch--
- <i>Chieftain. Anything else?</i>

35:10.777 --> 35:11.904
Stop staring at me!

35:12.487 --> 35:14.615
Marcus and Shirley are sitting
on his home address.

35:14.615 --> 35:17.075
Why, have they not worked out
what this is yet?

35:17.075 --> 35:17.993
<i>What is it?</i>

35:19.036 --> 35:21.163
Massive wank, that's what it is.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.706
What do you mean?

35:22.706 --> 35:24.666
That Chieftain are
just doing this for fun?

35:24.666 --> 35:25.792
<i>No, for money.</i>

35:25.792 --> 35:27.377
Get down to their office.

35:27.377 --> 35:30.797
And if you haven't worked it out by then,
don't come back.

35:33.842 --> 35:35.886
- Can I open my eyes yet?
- No.

35:42.768 --> 35:43.769
Spicy.

35:57.032 --> 35:58.242
She won't open it.

35:58.825 --> 35:59.826
Ms. Doran!

36:01.954 --> 36:02.955
It's Duffy!

36:04.164 --> 36:05.624
I'm coming in!

36:06.792 --> 36:08.126
<i>Fuck off.</i>

36:10.087 --> 36:14.091
Well, if I can't come in, could you
please send River Cartwright out?

36:18.512 --> 36:20.347
I don't know who that is.

36:20.347 --> 36:21.890
There isn't anyone else here.

36:22.641 --> 36:24.852
I would ask you to come in
and take a look, but I will not have--

36:24.852 --> 36:26.728
But you don't have Dogs on your floor.

36:26.728 --> 36:30.023
Yeah, but I have to override that
if you're harboring an intruder.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.235
Okay, come on in.

36:34.152 --> 36:38.115
But I'll need your details,
especially the one who called me a troll.

36:38.866 --> 36:43.120
I'll need his name
for the HR complaint I'm about to file.

36:45.664 --> 36:46.665
Hobbs!

36:49.126 --> 36:51.420
- We're just gonna leave him in there?
- He's not in there.

36:53.797 --> 36:55.799
It's their golden wedding anniversary.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.676
I am not buying them a subscription

36:57.676 --> 36:59.595
to a bacon delivery service.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.848
I don't care how good the bacon is.

37:03.640 --> 37:06.226
Yes, I know that's what Dad wants,
but what about Mum?

37:08.478 --> 37:11.148
You know when she's all,
"I don't mind. Don't make a fuss"?

37:11.148 --> 37:12.858
She's always lying.

37:15.986 --> 37:17.112
Okay, fine.

37:17.112 --> 37:20.407
You get them that,
and I will get them a decent present.

37:20.908 --> 37:23.744
You know, to stop Mum rightfully
stinking out the whole weekend.

37:24.912 --> 37:25.954
Okay.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.654
Hey, heading off early?

37:58.654 --> 38:00.322
Nope, still working.

38:00.322 --> 38:02.032
Gotta go sit in on a meeting at the Met.

38:02.032 --> 38:03.825
So you can write down
the big words for 'em?

38:05.536 --> 38:07.663
I used to go out
with a police officer, you know.

38:08.330 --> 38:09.373
Sorry.

38:09.373 --> 38:10.874
Honestly, don't be.

38:10.874 --> 38:13.043
He got suspended
for tasering himself in the foot.

38:13.043 --> 38:15.546
And that wasn't even in the top
three reasons why I left him so...

38:15.546 --> 38:16.964
Wow.

38:16.964 --> 38:18.090
Okay.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.592
- All right, take care, yeah.
- I'll see you.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.329
Right, I'm out.

38:49.329 --> 38:51.248
<i>Don't think you're getting a gold star.</i>

38:51.248 --> 38:53.750
Come on. I just broke in and out
of the Park. That's not nothing.

38:53.750 --> 38:58.338
I take that back. Thank you
for the sun which shines out of your arse.

38:58.338 --> 39:00.424
What, are you gonna tell me
why you pulled me out then?

39:00.424 --> 39:03.010
<i>Because you shouldn't have been in there
in the first place.</i>

39:03.010 --> 39:05.053
Yeah, well I thought Standish's life
was in danger.

39:05.053 --> 39:06.847
<i>No, you didn't think at all.</i>

39:07.347 --> 39:09.183
Then what the fuck is happening.
Who's got her?

39:10.058 --> 39:11.602
A Tiger Team.

39:12.686 --> 39:14.188
Oh, shit--

39:15.898 --> 39:19.276
River! I can't believe you left
without saying goodbye.

39:19.276 --> 39:22.070
- Hey, you dumb prick? Up here. Look.
- Now, listen. No, let's--

39:24.364 --> 39:26.491
It's just starting for you, sunshine.

39:26.491 --> 39:27.868
Put him in the fucking car!
