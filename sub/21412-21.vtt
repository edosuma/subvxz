<i>You know, my favorite way of
clearing my head's always been</i>

00:07.406 --> 00:10.283
<i>to swing above the hustle and
bustle of the city below.</i>

00:13.809 --> 00:15.494
- My purse!
- Uh-oh.

00:18.698 --> 00:21.268
<i>But after the recent
spider-virus outbreak,</i>

00:21.340 --> 00:23.607
<i>that hustle and bustle
has gone up a notch.</i>

00:29.791 --> 00:33.580
In fact,
it's gone up about 20 stories.

00:37.752 --> 00:40.315
Ow! Come on!
Watch where you peck!

00:41.222 --> 00:44.901
Hey, all! I'm looking
for a purse snatcher.

00:45.260 --> 00:48.119
Medium build,
sticky fingers,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.221
spider powers.

00:50.999 --> 00:53.112
Let me know if this sounds
too generic.

00:56.073 --> 00:58.213
- Whoa! One side!
- Sorry.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.907
Are you kidding?

01:00.979 --> 01:03.330
Where'd you learn how
to swing, you web-dork?

01:03.425 --> 01:05.651
Everyone's had powers
for, like, one day,

01:05.729 --> 01:07.916
and they think
they own the skies.

01:08.583 --> 01:11.174
Uh-oh!
Out of web fluid!

01:18.927 --> 01:21.327
Look at them all,
thwipping around

01:21.395 --> 01:24.216
with their organic web shooters
like there's no tomorrow.

01:24.473 --> 01:27.973
While I feel my college savings dip
with every web-cartridge spent.

01:28.802 --> 01:29.835
Hello?

01:29.903 --> 01:31.341
<i>Peter, it's Gwen.</i>

01:31.409 --> 01:33.950
<i>I made it home last night,
but something's wrong.</i>

01:34.075 --> 01:36.012
-<i> I need you to..</i>.
- Need what?

01:36.231 --> 01:37.919
Gwen? Are you there?

What's with the crowd?

01:56.151 --> 01:59.276
Haven't seen a mob like this since
the new Stark phone came out.

02:04.397 --> 02:09.521
Spider-Gwen!
Spider-Gwen! Spider-Gwen!

02:12.729 --> 02:16.216
Oh, I get it. These are what
adoring fans sound like.

02:16.346 --> 02:19.604
You guys have heard about
Spider-Man, right? Amazing.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.299
I mean, what that guy
can do with a web.

02:23.659 --> 02:26.059
Does that guy
actually know her?

02:26.127 --> 02:28.674
It's okay.
I'm a friend from school.

02:31.766 --> 02:34.501
Gwen? Hello?
Mr. Stacey?

02:34.680 --> 02:35.862
Anyone home?

02:35.930 --> 02:37.135
I'm coming in.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.151
Gwen?

02:40.708 --> 02:43.739
Man, you've got some monster fans
out there. I...

02:43.973 --> 02:45.856
Hey,
your frames are a little crooked.

02:46.051 --> 02:48.098
Gwen, what's going on?

02:49.793 --> 02:51.481
Are you okay?

02:54.351 --> 02:55.692
Gwen?

02:58.278 --> 03:01.153
Something tells me
you're not one of Gwen's fans!

03:08.123 --> 03:12.203

03:16.664 --> 03:19.099
Wait a minute.
I never forget a fang.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.321
You're that stealth spider that tried to
poison the city the other day, aren't you?

03:22.388 --> 03:24.763
What'd you do, come back for
Gwen's autograph?

03:25.568 --> 03:27.720
I don't know what you did
with Gwen, buddy,

03:27.912 --> 03:31.092
but she is not gonna like what
you've done to her place.

03:34.146 --> 03:35.162
Whoa!

03:35.230 --> 03:37.809
I just punched on oversized
spider-monster in the face.

03:37.974 --> 03:40.654
I have so many
conflicting emotions right now.

03:43.255 --> 03:46.599
Itsy-bitsy,
keep it coming, ugly!

03:49.482 --> 03:50.849
Almost there.

03:55.416 --> 03:58.970
Open and shut. Should be enough
webbing to hold...

04:04.726 --> 04:07.501
It's a monster!
Where's Spider-Gwen?

04:08.935 --> 04:11.247
That's exactly
what I wanna know!

04:14.497 --> 04:17.130
I could use a little
spider-powered help here, guys!

04:17.255 --> 04:20.733
Just because we have powers doesn't
mean we're heroes like Spider-Gwen.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.419
- What about Spider-Man?
- Pfft! Menace.

04:27.792 --> 04:30.167
Ugh! Spider breath!

04:30.307 --> 04:32.893
Back off, Gwen.
Parker's not on the menu.

04:33.150 --> 04:34.745
Anya?

04:39.409 --> 04:40.425
Two things.

04:40.493 --> 04:42.193
First, wow!

04:42.330 --> 04:45.440
And second, why do you think
that spider-monster is Gwen?

04:45.508 --> 04:47.257
First, don't be so surprised.

04:47.343 --> 04:50.398
Second, it's wearing
what's left of Gwen's costume.

04:52.099 --> 04:53.836
And third,
I'm smarter than you

04:53.929 --> 04:55.398
and already
pieced this together.

04:55.466 --> 04:57.726
Why did I know
that last part was coming?

04:58.553 --> 05:00.031
Wait! Gwen!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.468
Okay, let's go.

05:03.447 --> 05:06.257
Where there's
smoke there's fire.

05:13.734 --> 05:14.927
Gwen left a voice mail.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.406
Said something
was happening to her.

05:16.531 --> 05:18.734
She must've called me
when she couldn't reach you.

05:18.921 --> 05:20.765
Then the phone went dead.

05:33.623 --> 05:35.740
I'll wrap this up!
You go for help!

05:35.857 --> 05:38.451
You're not seriously side-lining
me, are you, Parker?

05:38.545 --> 05:41.430
Because Gwen's my best friend,
so I'm staying.

05:41.498 --> 05:44.657
But... If this was
Harry, you'd do the same.

05:44.935 --> 05:46.482
She's still Gwen.

05:48.191 --> 05:51.064
You're still in there, Gwen.
Aren't you?

05:51.318 --> 05:54.951
Come on. Let's get you back to
Horizon, figure out a cure.

05:57.872 --> 06:00.053
I'd take that as a "no."

06:04.533 --> 06:07.614
Okay, okay. Let's get
Gwen-Monster into the alley.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.539
Oh, so now it's okay
to call her "Gwen-Monster."

06:10.607 --> 06:12.912
You kidding?
Did you hear that screaming?

06:13.099 --> 06:15.076
That's movie monster
screaming.

06:17.248 --> 06:18.654
Almost there.

06:21.683 --> 06:23.131
Keep on her!

06:25.378 --> 06:26.996
There's nowhere
left to go, Gwen.

06:27.091 --> 06:29.261
Just make this easy
and give up.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.025
That does not sound like
"I surrender"!

06:39.580 --> 06:40.680
Nice save.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.877
You sure picked up quick
on those spider powers.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.322
It's all in the wrist.

06:44.963 --> 06:47.431
Uh, maybe it was just luck.

06:47.550 --> 06:51.431
Your good fortune
has turned into mine.

06:51.713 --> 06:53.244
Kraven the Hunter!

06:53.494 --> 06:55.955
When the entire
island of Manhattan

06:56.080 --> 06:58.164
gained spider powers,
I thought,

06:58.259 --> 07:01.205
"What a challenge
for the great Kraven."

07:01.359 --> 07:05.071
Then when I saw on the news a
hideous spider-creature emerged,

07:05.213 --> 07:09.416
I had but one thought...
Ratings gold!

07:09.931 --> 07:13.197
Now watch
as Kraven takes down

07:13.267 --> 07:18.720
his most extraordinary prey
of all time.

07:21.486 --> 07:24.345
Say good night, monster.

07:24.713 --> 07:26.494
I don't think so, Kraven!

07:33.074 --> 07:34.951
She's getting away!

07:41.154 --> 07:43.476
How dare you interfere!

07:44.060 --> 07:45.833
Although, just as well.

07:46.013 --> 07:48.154
A trapped creature
is no challenge.

07:48.419 --> 07:50.857
That is like shooting
the fish in barrel.

07:51.201 --> 07:54.380
Which we did in season one of Kraven's
Amazing Hunt,

07:54.448 --> 07:56.294
now available for download.

08:01.809 --> 08:03.325
Anya, you wrangle Gwen.

08:03.393 --> 08:05.731
I'll take care of
the reality show hunter.

08:05.974 --> 08:09.560
What? Peter, even Spider-Man
can barely take Kraven.

08:09.677 --> 08:11.833
- What are you gonna do?
- Just go!

08:12.044 --> 08:14.201
I'll distract him
as long as I can.

08:19.599 --> 08:22.497
Why do all my best
ideas give me headaches?

08:23.021 --> 08:27.802
You are becoming
a menace, little man.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.021
A menace?
You don't know the half of it.

08:32.224 --> 08:35.232
Anyone keeping me
from my hunt must be stopped.

08:35.357 --> 08:37.513
Plus it is great television.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.416
I don't know
who you are, boy,

09:13.601 --> 09:14.807
but...

09:15.603 --> 09:18.369
Wait. I do know you.

09:19.096 --> 09:21.221
Your scent is familiar.

09:26.503 --> 09:28.823
Huh. That's a good look
for you.

09:28.997 --> 09:31.301
And just in time
for your close-up.

09:35.770 --> 09:38.239
Whoaaaa!

09:44.309 --> 09:46.231
Huh.
And don't forget, folks,

09:46.307 --> 09:48.934
always be on the hunt
for items to recycle.

09:49.103 --> 09:50.942
It's the hero thing to do.

09:51.192 --> 09:52.583
Huh?

09:54.231 --> 09:55.567
Enough!

09:55.710 --> 09:58.528
You will now learn
a painful lesson.

09:58.700 --> 10:02.528
If you get in the way,
you become the prey!

10:02.596 --> 10:04.840
Like it says on the back
of the official Kraven T-shirt,

10:04.918 --> 10:07.339
available online now
for just 19.95.

10:10.786 --> 10:14.940
You are skilled for such an
inferior-looking creature.

10:15.106 --> 10:18.550
Much like the African toad,
who appears docile,

10:18.643 --> 10:21.878
but whose darts have the
strength of a bomb!

10:23.955 --> 10:25.080
Aah!

10:25.198 --> 10:27.370
You fought bravely today.

10:27.690 --> 10:31.073
You earned my respect,
and this...

10:31.188 --> 10:35.573
An autographed 8-by-10 glossy
of my most popular hunt.

10:35.737 --> 10:39.118
You can place it on your wall and
impress your...

10:41.412 --> 10:42.701
Get in!

10:42.965 --> 10:44.232
Harry?

10:44.517 --> 10:46.717
How did you know
where to find me?

10:46.853 --> 10:48.975
I didn't.
Now buckle up.

10:57.158 --> 11:00.940
I've been tracking the spider-monster
that peaced out on Liberty Island.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.275
Been following it through
its vibrational patterns.

11:03.473 --> 11:05.926
Ohh! Tactile communication,

11:06.047 --> 11:08.879
the method spiders use to find
each other over web-strands.

11:09.058 --> 11:11.113
Yep. I've just been
tracking the more...

11:11.277 --> 11:13.379
Well, monstrous vibrations.

11:13.551 --> 11:15.988
Nice. Now we'll be able
to track Gwen as well.

11:16.098 --> 11:18.043
Gwen?
What happened to her?

11:18.125 --> 11:21.691
You're not gonna believe this, but
Gwen turned into a spider-monster too.

11:21.918 --> 11:24.433
Pal, this entire city
has spider powers.

11:24.543 --> 11:26.738
I'll believe anything
at this point.

11:28.777 --> 11:30.285
Hold on!

11:33.074 --> 11:36.386
- So, are we good with each other?
- Yeah. Sorry.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.349
I just got freaked out the other day
when I thought you were Spider-Man.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.720
But right now, that's the
least of my worries.

11:41.879 --> 11:43.049
Uh, good.

11:43.230 --> 11:46.230
Why such an interest
in the original spider-monster?

11:46.605 --> 11:48.419
Pete, I know this
is gonna sound crazy,

11:48.487 --> 11:51.605
but... I think
my dad's alive.

11:51.808 --> 11:55.419
What? How?
Norman Osborn's tough,

11:55.487 --> 11:58.255
but there's no way he could've
survived that explosion at Midtown.

11:58.323 --> 12:02.584
Unless he was infected by the virus
first, and it gave him spider powers,

12:02.652 --> 12:05.331
which could also explain
the mysterious stealth spider.

12:05.472 --> 12:07.691
And since he was the first one
with spider powers,

12:07.808 --> 12:10.209
he'd be the first one
to mutate to a monster.

12:10.292 --> 12:11.972
That's why I've
been tracking him.

12:12.144 --> 12:15.402
I... I have to know for sure.

12:15.519 --> 12:19.167
I'm scared, Pete.
I want my dad to be alive.

12:19.245 --> 12:21.287
But if he is,
then I also need to figure out

12:21.355 --> 12:23.620
why he tried to poison the
city as the stealth spider.

12:23.698 --> 12:25.862
Let's take things
one step at a time.

12:26.581 --> 12:28.167
It's a lot to deal with.

12:29.027 --> 12:30.909
But you won't have to
go through it alone.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.441
Hopefully,
this is our monster.

12:47.269 --> 12:49.027
That one is Gwen.

12:52.378 --> 12:53.691
Huh? Gotcha!

12:53.870 --> 12:55.214
Who's got the moves?

12:55.323 --> 12:56.677
Anya's got the moves!

12:56.745 --> 12:58.924
Oh, yeah! Pssh!

12:59.316 --> 13:02.191
She's really taken to these
spider powers, hasn't she?

13:02.331 --> 13:05.269
Yeah. And her ego's
the size of Spider-Man's too.

13:06.612 --> 13:08.706
You guys got room
for two more?

13:14.534 --> 13:17.042
Gotta admit, this truck's
pretty decked out.

13:17.167 --> 13:19.612
It's a mobile lab, with a
few modifications

13:19.683 --> 13:21.425
and a lot of new tech.

13:21.822 --> 13:23.792
Shh! Sweet.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.917
I can get a jump on my research
to help Gwen.

13:26.019 --> 13:29.409
But I'll need my equipment back at
Horizon if I'm gonna synthesize a cure.

13:29.573 --> 13:31.472
We should head directly there.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.252
Looks like we're making
a detour first.

13:37.706 --> 13:39.972
Hey, watch the bumps!

13:40.105 --> 13:42.503
Sorry. We've got a hit
on Norman-Monster.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.948
"Norman-Monster"?

13:44.098 --> 13:46.558
Yeah. It's a long story.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.261
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.458
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

14:06.719 --> 14:10.297
Um, nothing about
any of this is okay.

14:11.898 --> 14:13.969
Kraven has returned!

14:16.297 --> 14:19.758
I warned you not to interfere.

14:20.801 --> 14:24.344
Once Kraven sets his sights
on his prey,

14:24.750 --> 14:28.195
nothing will stop
his victory.

14:28.672 --> 14:32.284
Yes, you are right to fear

14:32.453 --> 14:34.313
the hunter.

14:41.492 --> 14:44.109
A
Second arachnid-monster?

14:48.195 --> 14:51.370
Larger and more hideous
than the first?

14:51.578 --> 14:53.289
Perfect.

14:55.945 --> 14:57.409
Come, creature.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.617
Show me your worst,

14:59.734 --> 15:04.133
and I shall
show you my best!

15:17.701 --> 15:19.768
Huh?

15:29.488 --> 15:30.831
Dad!

15:31.628 --> 15:32.886
"Dad"?

15:33.425 --> 15:37.249
So this monster
is the great Norman Osborn?

15:37.839 --> 15:41.186
Perfect.
I will exact my revenge

15:41.316 --> 15:43.745
for the disrespect
you showed me

15:43.813 --> 15:46.238
when we last met.

15:54.234 --> 15:58.198
- Harry, you can't get between those two.
- You'll be crushed!

15:58.331 --> 16:00.572
I've gotta do something!

16:06.448 --> 16:09.081
Being Gwen's friend is hard.

16:09.116 --> 16:10.649
Third time's a charm.

16:12.761 --> 16:14.660
You go for Gwen!
I've got a plan!

16:14.807 --> 16:16.496
But...
Go!

16:32.035 --> 16:33.356
Be...

16:33.424 --> 16:36.419
quiet!

16:42.872 --> 16:45.786
This exterior suits you,
Norman.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.954
It shows the true monster
you are within,

16:49.160 --> 16:52.559
and will look great
in my museum!

16:58.434 --> 17:00.130
Come on, Gwen!

17:09.568 --> 17:12.685
Weren't you just telling Harry
to stay clear of the monsters?

17:12.818 --> 17:15.107
He doesn't have spider powers
like we do, Anya.

17:15.209 --> 17:16.887
He can't just... Whoa!

17:23.848 --> 17:25.848
Frying my web shooters!

17:28.044 --> 17:30.045
Need a hand, Pete?

17:32.733 --> 17:34.934
Huh? Gwen!

17:39.479 --> 17:42.742
There's armor for everyone.
If we're gonna stop these guys,

17:42.810 --> 17:45.077
you're gonna need more
than just spider powers.

17:45.498 --> 17:49.130
Good, 'cause some of mine just broke.

17:52.474 --> 17:53.990
I can't stop her.

17:54.144 --> 17:56.889
Want to wear a cool costume,
maybe absorb some of those hits?

17:58.060 --> 17:59.693
Yes, please.

18:02.459 --> 18:04.496
Dos vidanya, Osborn.

18:04.819 --> 18:06.623
Get away from him!

18:28.589 --> 18:30.689
Hey, Gwen,
you look lost.

18:31.065 --> 18:32.846
Anya, stay back!

18:32.948 --> 18:34.877
She's still my friend, Peter.

18:35.463 --> 18:38.307
Gwen, it's Anya.
I'm here to help you, honey.

18:38.455 --> 18:41.448
Let me do that.
Let me help my best friend.

18:50.644 --> 18:53.182
Stay away from my dad!

18:54.852 --> 18:56.237
Harry!

18:57.892 --> 19:00.527
Ugh! No web shooters!

19:02.291 --> 19:06.205
Finally, just you and me.

19:06.744 --> 19:11.291
Now you'll regret
all you've done.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.432
No! Don't!
You're gonna kill him!

19:18.613 --> 19:21.440
Back off, Kraven!

19:25.737 --> 19:27.132
What are you...

19:40.491 --> 19:42.030
Why would you do this?

19:42.115 --> 19:44.108
Because he's
my best friend.

19:44.731 --> 19:46.108
You?

19:53.186 --> 19:54.764
Thanks for saving
my life, Harry.

19:54.858 --> 19:56.208
You saved my dad's.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.905
Plus, you know,
it's what friends do.

20:00.038 --> 20:05.241
You will need more
than friendship to beat me!

20:05.368 --> 20:06.655
Seriously?

20:08.085 --> 20:09.920
I know a girl
who'd love to help.

20:10.029 --> 20:13.553
You are hardly
a match for Kraven.

20:13.725 --> 20:15.967
Wasn't talking about me.

20:16.413 --> 20:18.335
Ah, the thrill of the hunt!

20:19.606 --> 20:22.239
No! No!

20:34.288 --> 20:35.517
What's this?

20:35.615 --> 20:37.725
For fighting
worthy of Spider-Man.

20:41.888 --> 20:44.803
For fighting worthy
of a best friend.

20:45.623 --> 20:48.319
How were you able
to get Gwen to do that?

20:48.600 --> 20:51.863
Beneath all that scary,
Gwen's still in there.

20:51.991 --> 20:54.933
I just reached her on an
emotional level, I guess.

21:00.011 --> 21:02.436
Dad? It's me.

21:02.507 --> 21:04.257
It's Harry.

21:11.288 --> 21:12.557
Don't worry, Harry.

21:12.717 --> 21:14.498
Norman's just not himself.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.688
We'll find him,
and we'll help him.

21:17.225 --> 21:19.334
- How?
- We've got this tracker.

21:19.498 --> 21:22.225
And he's one monster in a city
of eight million people.

21:23.665 --> 21:26.045
What? I'm getting
more tracker hits!

21:26.767 --> 21:29.071
I think you mean
we're three people

21:29.139 --> 21:31.788
in a city
of eight million monsters.

21:31.998 --> 21:35.808
Oh, no! Looks like it's monster
week on Spider Island!
