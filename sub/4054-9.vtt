NARRATOR: Four weeks ago,
a dome crashed on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:09.210
cutting us off from the rest
of the world.

00:09.384 --> 00:12.091
The dome has tested our limits,
forcing each of us

00:12.262 --> 00:14.799
to confront our own personal demons:

00:14.973 --> 00:20.434
Rage, grief, fear.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.639
My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:27.900
Now, in order to survive, we must
battle our most dangerous adversary:

00:28.070 --> 00:30.106
the enemy within.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.568
MARSTON: Twenty-five years ago,
a team discovered

00:33.742 --> 00:35.949
fragments of what appeared
to be an egg.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.531
Whatever was inside
that egg altered their behavior.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.865
NORRIE:
Hektor Martin?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.450
He's the real head of Aktaion.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.458
Last update has you
in Dr. Marston's custody.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.493
CHRISTINE:
The dome's surface is calcifying.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.628
Unless I can bring down the dome
with Joe's help.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.256
- You're pregnant?
- It's a girl.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.554
EVA: What are they all here for?
- The future queen.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.552
With the right frequency
and amplitude,

00:56.723 --> 00:58.224
it's possible the dome could shatter.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.508
Sam's a part of the kinship
and I think he took Joe.

01:00.686 --> 01:04.099
The rest are at Coggins' funeral home.
Gather everyone you can and go there.

01:04.273 --> 01:07.356
- We're surrounded.
- This is where we make our stand.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.733
I'm right here, come back to me.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.313
Julia.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.160
BARBIE:
Oh, my God.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.202
- Are you okay? Did I hurt you?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:24.376 --> 01:30.121
- Are you? Shocks, I am so--
- Julia. Julia.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.666
I chased you down
and tried to kill you.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.960
All of those things that I said,
I didn't mean any of that.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.800
Same here.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.717
Except how much I love you.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.682
I love you too.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.394
You saved me
from becoming one of them.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.854
You never gave up on me.

01:56.617 --> 02:00.326
- I knew the real you was still in there.
- I am so sorry.

02:00.495 --> 02:04.158
Later. The Resistance.

02:05.834 --> 02:10.043
They're hiding in the funeral home.
They need all the help they can get.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.183
Hell. There are dozens of them.
They're everywhere.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.265
Stay away from the window!

02:32.444 --> 02:34.309
That moves, shoot.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.484
- What do I do?
- Aim at the torches.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.404
[GUN CLICKING]

02:46.625 --> 02:49.708
- It doesn't work.
- Safety's on.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.878
They're not coming to capture us.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.290
They're coming to burn us
to the ground.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.224
Somebody else out there shooting.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.143
Go, go, go!

03:13.193 --> 03:14.524
- Move, move. Clear.
- Stay there!

03:14.695 --> 03:16.276
- On the ground!
- Who the hell are you?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.778
- Hektor Martin.
- He runs Aktaion.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.816
Look, I'm here to help.
Where can we take you to be safe?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.992
Now.

03:31.670 --> 03:35.458
All right, cover me. I'll lead.

03:45.684 --> 03:49.302
We need to talk about this
while it's just the two of us.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.557
Yesterday was awful. Okay?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.393
Everything's been
pretty much a nightmare

03:53.567 --> 03:55.523
since you came out
of those cocoons.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.900
We don't have to do this now.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.356
- We can't pretend it didn't happen.
- I know.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.694
What I don't know
is how we can get back to...

04:02.868 --> 04:04.449
what we were, if we even can.

04:05.287 --> 04:09.246
Look, things are different.
Eva is pregnant.

04:09.416 --> 04:13.500
That baby's mine.
I'm not gonna bail on being a father.

04:13.670 --> 04:18.334
- That child is innocent of all of this.
- Barbie, your daughter...

04:19.718 --> 04:21.174
My daughter what?

04:22.304 --> 04:25.592
Christine kept detailed notes
on a voice recorder.

04:25.766 --> 04:30.601
It's an instruction manual on how
to use us to keep the life force alive.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.684
She made it for her successor,
the next queen.

04:34.858 --> 04:38.771
And she paired you and Eva together
for a reason.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.399
Your daughter is that queen.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.857
Christine did this?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.995
I know it's a lot to take in.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.747
At least we have nine months
to figure it out.

04:53.752 --> 04:57.085
Norrie. Jim.
They were all in there.

04:57.255 --> 05:01.214
You stay here. I'll check it out first.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.505
Good work bringing Joe back.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.807
When he took me to the funeral home,
he said he thought the schematic

05:07.974 --> 05:11.216
was a way to bring the dome down
with sound waves or something.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.809
That's why Christine wanted him.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.187
We need Joe
to start working immediately.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.940
- I don't see him cooperating.
- We have ways.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.396
Tell the others Norrie
is not to be killed.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.404
- Leverage?
- If we need it.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.490
Joe.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.405
Kinship needs your help.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.167
The dome is calcifying, and for us
to survive, we need you on our side.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.623
Never. Gonna. Happen.

05:41.216 --> 05:46.051
- You backstabbing ass.
- Well, we tried nice.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.770
It's possible
nobody survived this attack.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.897
The only bodies are out here.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.605
If Jim had other safe houses
on his radar, maybe they escaped.

06:02.779 --> 06:07.569
Yeah, or they were taken.
If they're alive, it won't be for long.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.116
The Kinship still thinks
that I'm a part of them

06:10.287 --> 06:13.279
so why don't I head down to Town Hall,
see what I can find out.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.914
I'll go check out the other places
the Resistance could be hiding.

06:18.295 --> 06:23.460
What if somehow they know
you're not one them anymore?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.464
They won't. I can fake it.

06:26.177 --> 06:30.762
- And if you see Eva again?
- l was used.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.093
l was manipulated by Christine
to father a child.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.680
The only thing
that | feel right now is anger.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.097
So I'm gonna get in there, I'm gonna
find out what we need to know

06:40.275 --> 06:43.483
and I will come back to you, okay?

06:49.367 --> 06:52.655
- Be careful.
- I will. You too.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.660
Take this.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.079
If I'm gonna pass with the Kinship,
they need to believe that I killed you.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.118
So if you're seen, we're done.

07:03.632 --> 07:07.921
Take my car. I'm dead, can't drive.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.426
Meet me at Hollerhan's Dock
in two hours?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.133
Yeah.

07:26.196 --> 07:31.941
Hey. Hey, Indy. Hey, boy.
Let me look at that.

07:32.118 --> 07:37.078
You had my back, huh? Good boy.
l have an idea.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.374
Wanna go find Jim?

07:38.541 --> 07:40.998
I think I know which one of us
he's gonna be happier to see.

07:41.169 --> 07:45.037
Come on. Let's go, boy. Let's go.

07:52.347 --> 07:56.431
Limited doors, secured windows,
closed-circuit camera.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.592
Set up base.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.480
- We're holding up here with Aktaion?
- Yeah.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.312
What about Joe?
We should go after him.

08:06.486 --> 08:11.230
News flash, we're being hunted.
We just have to sit tight.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.829
No one said you could stay.
This is my safe house.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.826
That's a hell of a way to thank the man
who just saved your life.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.080
- I don't owe you squat.
- Actually, you do.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.421
Dr. Marston.
I sent supplies here for his rescue.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.803
He wasn't at the funeral home.
He's not here, so where is he?

08:36.307 --> 08:39.925
- He's stashed in a safe place.
- Where?

08:41.688 --> 08:45.180
I'll take you to him.
No,no,no.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.144
Just you and me.

08:47.318 --> 08:51.937
Never trusted anybody in a black suit.
Tie or otherwise.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.406
Jim, you don't call the shots.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.864
Disarm him.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.084
- Take me to Marston.
- What are we waiting for?

09:25.148 --> 09:28.060
Get back to work.
Take care of the injured.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.155
Where's Christine?

09:36.326 --> 09:39.989
She's at the Jacobsen's farm
taking care of Eva.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.158
I know about the baby.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.086
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.290
Christine says
they're not to be disturbed.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.208
- What about Julia?
- It's done.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.843
- Where's the body?
- Buried at Shumway's cabin.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.131
Is the Resistance still out there?

10:02.310 --> 10:05.768
Unfortunately,
but we have who we need. Joe.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.439
Heh. You don't know?

10:11.194 --> 10:14.937
Our survival depends on a device
that can bring down the dome.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.949
And Christine needs Joe to build it,
but he refuses to help.

10:19.911 --> 10:23.074
- Well, where is he?
- No, I've already tried.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.292
Take me to Joe.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.629
Be careful.
That thing might be loaded.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.011
It is, but I don't know how to use it.

Squeeze that trigger. Steady.

And slow.

- Noise will give away our location.

- Hi. Heh.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.860
I never thought we'd meet in person
and now you're here.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.824
Obviously, I've got questions.

was everything Aktaion had
on the dome from day one.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.382
Why'd you dump it?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.221
I thought maybe one day
we'd need it.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.102
And the folder
with the MIT time-lock level encryption?

12:12.273 --> 12:13.308
Who's gonna need that?

12:14.859 --> 12:15.894
What?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.310
An unnamed folder's buried
in those files.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.821
- Someone worked very hard to hide it.
- I didn't know it was there.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.151
Do you think you can open it?

12:24.786 --> 12:29.450
Okay, legend, I want to watch.
See Hunter the Hacktivist in action.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.244
Lily, last time I saw you, you grabbed
a hand cannon and booked it.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.668
Someone was chasing you
and you ran through the red door.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.879
It's the only way to get here.
What is it?

12:43.429 --> 12:47.513
I want to tell you, but I need to run it
by Hektor first, okay?

Trust me.

Oh, my God.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.894
- I warned Marston.
HEKTOR: Yeah.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.150
JIM: Oh, it's probably a raid.
You saw the way they came after us.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.357
What was Marston doing here?
Why wasn't he with you?

13:02.532 --> 13:05.023
Hey, hey. I rescued him
from those zombies, okay?

13:05.201 --> 13:07.157
I told him to come with us
to the funeral parlor,

13:07.328 --> 13:08.829
he wouldn't be safe here.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.579
He said he needed to get back
to his lab.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.535
Damn it.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.455
If he's dead
and his samples are destroyed,

13:16.629 --> 13:18.415
then everything
I came here for is gone.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.590
What'd you come here for?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.305
All right.

13:31.436 --> 13:35.224
There's no more to see here.
Sorry about your friend.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.265
Sorry doesn't mean a damn thing.
This isn't about Marston anymore.

This is about all of those people.
It's about your son.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.172
- Marston?
- That's what he was doing here.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.422
Finding a cure.

15:27.593 --> 15:32.337
Without him, without DNA
he collected from Christine Price...

15:35.893 --> 15:37.144
[SIGHS]

15:42.608 --> 15:44.064
And you.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.644
He e-mailed us meticulous notes.
You gave him a hard time.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.232
After that, I never saw him again.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.064
We didn't have any eyes
inside the house.

15:52.243 --> 15:55.827
No satellite images of his kidnapping.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.576
We wanted to move
when this raid happened.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.033
Blind spots.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.248
And you.

16:07.091 --> 16:11.835
And you're a killer.
Men, women, young, old.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.969
Your hands are soaked
with their blood.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.758
Hey, just, uh,
calm down there, okay? Hey.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.266
You killed him.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.849
Marston wouldn't come back here
if he knew there was a threat.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.890
- Maybe Marston needed you, I don't.
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.059
Shoot me
and you'll never get what you want.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.814
What's the first thing
your company does

16:33.993 --> 16:35.949
when they send a unit
into the Khyber Pass, huh?

16:36.370 --> 16:41.990
Find a villager, a local, who can
tell them things that no satellite can,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.659
access intel.

16:45.630 --> 16:51.421
Christine's DNA, whatever you need,
I'm the only one that can get it.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.061
I'm here now.

17:02.605 --> 17:07.440
No blind spots.
You better deliver.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.790
Look, nothing you do to me
will make me help you.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.251
There's no reason for you not to help.

17:34.428 --> 17:39.718
The Resistance has been killed.
Including Julia, thanks to Barbie.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.804
- Is that true?
- It's true.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.686
Joe, it's time
you started working with us.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.812
You're fighting for nobody
but yourself.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.100
There's nothing left for you
but the Kinship.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.984
- That's enough.
- Go to hell.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.444
That's enough. I said, that's enough.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.410
Get out of here.
He's never going to listen to you.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.785
Good cop, bad cop. I get it.

18:11.591 --> 18:15.550
Joe. I am not one of them, okay?
It's really me.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.133
I didn't kill Julia.
She's the one that brought me back.

18:20.683 --> 18:23.265
What about Norrie?
And the others?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.685
I'm hoping they're still alive,
but we gotta get you out of here.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.471
I fell for this before with Sam.

18:31.027 --> 18:37.148
Look, I promise you this is real.
Come meet Julia with me.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.907
Joe, this is me.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.945
It's the same guy that found you
at the Sweetbriar after Angie died.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.244
l was there for you then,
I am here for you now.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.246
If I was one of them, wouldn't I want
you to stay here and build this thing?

18:53.424 --> 18:58.214
All right, point taken.
Welcome back.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.629
So the dome. Is it calcifying?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.929
-Yes.
-And it's sealing up.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.685
Air's not gonna get through
and we'll suffocate.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.931
Barbie, l have to stay
and build this device.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.316
What are you talking about, stay?

19:14.487 --> 19:17.194
I hate to help the Kinship,
but it's the only way out of here.

19:18.032 --> 19:22.822
And if I work with them and figure out
how to build it, then everyone's free.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.577
And then what?

19:25.748 --> 19:27.704
I mean, Christine's gotta have
other plans for us

19:27.875 --> 19:31.584
- once this dome comes down.
- Well, I don't know.

19:32.463 --> 19:36.206
But the longer we both work with them,
the better our chances of finding out.

19:38.552 --> 19:42.511
You know what's going to happen
to you after you build this thing?

19:42.682 --> 19:46.140
- Once they don't need you anymore.
- I'll be killed.

19:46.811 --> 19:51.805
But if I don't do this, we're all dead.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.613
Joe's gonna work with us.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.991
- You sure he's not--?
- He's not your concern anymore.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.868
- Put Sam on it.
- Copy that.

20:10.167 --> 20:15.207
Let me explain something to you.
That back in there?

20:16.006 --> 20:20.090
That wasn't good cop, bad cop.
This Kinship has a hierarchy.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.377
We all have our place.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.471
Remember yours.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.136
Where are you going?

20:29.562 --> 20:33.601
If you're headed to see Eva,
Christine said don't disturb them.

20:33.774 --> 20:37.141
- I already told you that.
- Eva's pregnant with my child.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.275
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.

20:41.073 --> 20:45.533
What did it feel like?
When you killed Julia.

20:54.086 --> 20:58.045
Like I gave a great gift to our cause.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.586
JIM:
This stuff is gonna save Junior?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.467
We'll infuse the serum
with Christine's DNA,

21:03.637 --> 21:05.343
which contains a pure form
of the infection.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.470
- Once injected, infection--
- Sounds like voodoo.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.893
It's based on cutting-edge research.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.642
Two days ago, I infiltrated Town Hall
and almost assassinated

21:12.813 --> 21:14.769
one of the Kinship's
highest ranking citizens.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.022
Let's just say I'm not one
of their favorite people.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.558
- Hard to believe.
- I go in there

21:18.736 --> 21:21.773
and get your sample from Christine,
it's a big risk.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.108
I don't know
if this so-called "cure" is worth it.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.695
We can do it without you.
Three of my men were SEAL team.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.781
Ooh, good luck.
It's your guys against 2,000.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.695
You know, Jim,
you're not doing us a favor.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.865
Last time I checked,
your backup was pretty weak.

21:34.043 --> 21:37.080
Besides, if you care anything about
your son, it's a risk you'll wanna take.

21:37.254 --> 21:41.748
Trust me. Because what can happen
will scare the living hell out of you.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.137
[GASPING]
I can't breathe.

21:48.307 --> 21:53.301
Pink stars, so beautiful.
Pink stars falling.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.765
Falling in lines. Falling in lines.

21:55.940 --> 21:59.228
Patrick. Nothing's falling, okay?
You're safe here.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.939
Launch them. Hurry.
After the queen is born!

22:03.113 --> 22:07.231
- The war begins! Hurry!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.821
I've got a team on this, okay?
They're the best in the world.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.156
We're gonna find a way
to get you better.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.871
The eggs are important.
You've got to keep going.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.410
[GROANING]

22:20.840 --> 22:22.080
He's hurting himself.

22:23.259 --> 22:28.128
Hey. We've gotta keep him restrained.
It's for his own good.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.138
I'll be outside.

22:32.142 --> 22:38.854
Hey. Hey, Papa-dop.
I brought something, listen, listen.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.351
Remember every Sunday
we'd go to that coffee shop?

22:44.280 --> 22:47.317
Read the paper and go to a movie?
Do you remember that?

22:51.412 --> 22:55.030
I thought maybe
this smell could take you back there.

23:06.844 --> 23:12.180
You'd tell me,
"Plenty of time later in life for caffeine.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.931
One day I'll be happy if that's
the only drug you ever take."

23:21.734 --> 23:23.190
Dad?

23:25.696 --> 23:26.811
Do you remember that?

23:29.617 --> 23:33.860
It's time! It's coming.

23:34.496 --> 23:38.364
We will live on!

23:38.542 --> 23:41.750
[PATRICK GROANING]

23:43.797 --> 23:45.298
HEKTOR:
We couldn’t save him.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.125
Oh, it's a touching story.
Is any of it true?

23:49.303 --> 23:51.794
- Why would that be a lie?
- I don't know.

23:51.972 --> 23:55.635
Maybe someone's trying
to pluck on my heartstrings, uh,

23:55.809 --> 23:57.720
so they can further
their own agenda.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.431
The only agenda we have
is to cure this town.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.721
[CHUCKLES]

24:01.899 --> 24:05.437
I know enough about your company
to suspect that ain't the case.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.397
Jim, Junior's been infected
for about a week.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.436
The longer you wait, the worse it'll get.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.106
What happened to Patrick
will happen to your son.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.567
[DOG BARKING]

24:14.745 --> 24:16.952
MAN 1: Freeze! Don't move!
MAN 2: Hold it right there.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.408
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
JIM: Indy!

24:19.583 --> 24:23.451
Hey. There you are, boy.
Hey, Indy, how are you?

24:23.629 --> 24:28.840
Hey, aw, what happened?
Don't you worry, I know who did this.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.500
Hey, Jim. Over here?

24:33.973 --> 24:37.682
Drop your weapons.
Raggedy Ann's with us.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.593
Lower your weapons.

24:43.357 --> 24:46.565
- You don't look like you killed a man.
- Didn't have to.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.522
I got through to Barbie.
Whatever infected him, it's gone.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.062
That's impossible.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.652
- And you are?
- Hektor Martin.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.488
Hektor founded Aktaion.
He's come bearing gifts.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.577
Cure for said infection.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.534
Well, whatever you brought,
we don't need it.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.500
Dale Barbara isn't better.
He's in a dormant phase.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.878
Once the infection's in a person,
it's there forever.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.040
- It's like chicken pox.
- Exactly.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.333
It can recur any time.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.253
It happened to my partner after he
touched an egg we found in Mexico.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.719
Once the dormant phase has
disappeared, the infection won out.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.430
JULIA: That was a different egg.
So was the one in Alaska.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.686
You have no proof
that what happened to your partner

25:24.857 --> 25:26.518
or those scientists will happen here.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.273
Could I talk to you inside, alone?

25:36.285 --> 25:38.276
Julia.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.695
What if Hektor is right?

25:40.873 --> 25:44.081
If this infection can come back,
then we should go get Joe and Barbie

25:44.251 --> 25:45.707
so they can be cured.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.582
We don't know Hektor.
Or if what he's saying is true.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.123
But we do know Barbie and Joe.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.963
Barbie is the same guy
he was before the cocoons.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.752
- Isn't Joe?
- Yes,

25:56.930 --> 25:59.717
but Sam was himself too
and then after he was with Christine,

25:59.892 --> 26:01.348
he went back to being one of them.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.224
But Joe is strong. He's like you.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.813
Right after the cocoons,
l was with all of them

26:07.983 --> 26:12.568
- and I felt this pull to the Kinship.
- Barbie is at Town Hall.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.775
He'll find Joe and they'll come back.
We just need to trust them.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.403
Good work leaving the clue
at the funeral parlor.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.943
The baby bottle was brilliant.

26:21.872 --> 26:27.412
l was looking out for you.
And now I wanna do the same for Joe.

26:28.045 --> 26:31.629
Why are you working with the people
who captured and tortured you?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.881
After everything that has happened
under this dome,

26:34.051 --> 26:35.916
now Aktaion's here to help?
I don't think so.

26:36.553 --> 26:40.466
I don't trust them, but they didn't blow
my brains out, okay?

26:40.641 --> 26:42.723
And on the outside chance
they do have a cure,

26:42.893 --> 26:45.054
Junior's gonna be first in line.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.345
But don't you want a vial waiting
for your boyfriend?

26:47.523 --> 26:49.980
I told you, he doesn't need it.
Love saved him.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.062
- Yeah, go ahead and laugh.
- Heh-heh. Love saved him, I see.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.603
Yeah, so love trumps five years
of medical research?

I tell you, I have a thousand dollars
that Barbie's back at Town Hall

26:59.576 --> 27:02.568
- making more babies with Eva.
- She's still alive?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.202
What happened to plan B?

27:04.373 --> 27:06.159
Didn't work out.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.746
Ah. Hell.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.378
I'll be back.
I gotta go meet Barbie.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.838
Joe's a double agent
and all we have to do is stay alive

27:18.011 --> 27:21.048
until he builds Christine's device,
assuming it works?

27:21.223 --> 27:24.465
- Well, it better.
- Because the dome is calcifying.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.386
If it doesn't come down,
then we're all dead.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.859
And Aktaion's alleged cure,
that won't even matter.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.483
All right, you ready
to go meet Hektor?

27:37.489 --> 27:42.358
Actually, there's something else
that I need to do.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.995
Christine took Eva up
to Jacobsen's farm.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.781
And you wanna go out there.

How was it being back
with the Kinship?

28:01.889 --> 28:06.258
- Did you feel any kind of a pull?
- No, there was nothing at all.

The anxiety you're feeling is normal.

About becoming a mother, about
the unknown, I felt the same way.

they could get infected.
