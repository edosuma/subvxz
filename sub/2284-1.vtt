00:49.133 --> 00:52.385
Now, this is exactly the type of
performance you would expect to see

00:52.469 --> 00:55.722
at the International Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella.

00:55.806 --> 00:56.931
Am I right, Gail?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.016
John, you're so right,
everything else seems wrong.

00:59.101 --> 01:02.228
Boy, these Barden University
Treblemakers always thrill the judges.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.855
And the ladies in the room
cannot get enough.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.065
So true, John.

01:06.150 --> 01:09.819
Nothing makes a woman feel more like a
girl than a man who sings like a boy.

01:36.388 --> 01:40.975
Chloe, look at you. You're a mess.
You're unfocused. You're unreliable.

01:41.059 --> 01:45.104
And your breath smells
like egg. Like, all the time.

01:45.189 --> 01:49.442
I can't believe the Bellas are being passed
on to you two slut bags after we graduate.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.444
Just don't eff up your solo.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.653
I won't disappoint you.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.743
My dad always says,
"If you're not here to win,"

01:54.782 --> 01:56.157
"get the hell out of Kuwait."

01:56.533 --> 01:58.701
Has your dad ever
told you to shut up?

02:02.372 --> 02:03.915
I'm fine.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.884
Ouch! Boy, that hurt.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.511
Sexy man-splits.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.596
His pain is our gain, Gail.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.905
All right, good luck, guys!

02:38.826 --> 02:40.326
Good luck out there!

02:40.577 --> 02:44.789
Seriously, you girls are
awesome... ly horrible.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.167
I hate you. Kill yourselves. Girl power!
Sisters before misters!

02:50.587 --> 02:54.131
All right, ladies, it's
now or never. Hands in!

02:54.466 --> 02:56.217
One, two...

02:58.554 --> 03:01.931
Up now, the Barden Bellas!

03:02.140 --> 03:04.267
Well, the Bellas
tonight are making history

03:04.351 --> 03:07.937
as the first ever all-female group
to advance to the ICCA finals.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.231
That's right, John. Now, why do
you think it's taken so long

03:10.315 --> 03:13.526
for an all-lady group to break through
that a cappella glass ceiling?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.779
Well, Gail, the women, typically,
cannot hit the low notes,

03:16.864 --> 03:19.407
which really round out an
arrangement, thrill the judges,

03:19.491 --> 03:21.367
and that can really hurt
them in competition.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.245
Women are about as good at a cappella
as they are at being doctors.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.752
One, two, three, four.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.784
Is it me or did we just take a
left turn into Snoozeville?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.787
Yeah, and we parked in a lot
where they do not validate.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.714
- No!
- Holy...

04:18.007 --> 04:19.716
This is a surprise!

04:19.843 --> 04:22.261
- This has never happened!
- Now, this is how you bring some excitement

04:22.346 --> 04:25.598
to the International Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.100
She had a week's worth
of lunch and lost it.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.936
Well, she didn't lose it.
We know exactly where it is.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.581
It's all over the third row.
No, no...

05:45.929 --> 05:47.930
I got it. Thanks.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.857
Hi there! Welcome to Barden
University. What dorm?

05:58.442 --> 05:59.734
Baker Hall, I think.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.423
Okay. So, what you're gonna do is
you're gonna go down this way,

06:02.446 --> 06:05.087
you're gonna take a right and you
go through those double doors...

06:15.292 --> 06:16.751
Your campus map.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.670
And your official
BU rape whistle.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.515
Don't blow it unless
it's actually happening.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.292
Hey.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.254
You must be Kimmy Jin.
I'm Beca.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.841
No English?

07:07.010 --> 07:08.344
Yes English?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.348
Just tell me where
you're at with English.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.523
There he is. I'm Benji.
You must be Jesse.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.484
And you must be kidding.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.363
Looking at it now, I can
see that it's a bit much.

07:27.531 --> 07:28.739
I can take it down.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.450
No, no way. I mean, it took a
second for my eyes to adjust,

07:31.535 --> 07:32.576
but I can roll with this.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.620
Look, just so you know,
I'm not a total nerd.

07:34.704 --> 07:38.374
I also happen to be super
into close-up magic.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.586
Dude, that's awesome!

07:42.671 --> 07:44.630
How long was that
little guy in there?

07:44.714 --> 07:45.756
Several days.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.355
Hey, this is campus police.
Hide your wine coolers.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.569
Just... It's your old
man making a funny.

08:07.571 --> 08:08.654
Chris Rock, everybody.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.906
Hey, you must be
Beca's roommate.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.617
I'm Dr. Mitchell, Beca's dad.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.078
I teach Comparative
Literature here.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.002
So, when did you get here?
How did you get here?

08:23.295 --> 08:26.297
Took a cab. Didn't wanna
inconvenience you and Sheila.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.423
How is the stepmonster?

08:28.592 --> 08:32.260
She is fine, thank you for asking. She's
actually in Vegas at a conference...

08:32.345 --> 08:35.597
No, Dad, I don't actually care. I
just wanted to say "stepmonster."

08:38.101 --> 08:40.352
So, have you guys been
out on the quad yet?

08:40.437 --> 08:43.063
In the springtime, all the
students study on the grass.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.481
I don't wanna study
on the grass, Dad.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.984
I need to move to LA and get
a job at a record label

08:47.068 --> 08:48.402
and start paying my dues.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.196
Here we go again.
You know, Beca,

08:50.280 --> 08:53.115
DJing is not a profession,
it's a hobby.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.577
Unless you're Rick Dees
or someone awesome.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.705
That's not... I...

08:59.789 --> 09:02.875
I wanna produce music.
I wanna make music, Dad.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.669
But you're going to get
a college education first.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.631
For free, I might add.
End of story.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.009
I'm going to
the Activities Fair.

09:12.636 --> 09:16.805
Me, too. I'm going to the Activities Fair
with my super-good friend, Kimmy Jin.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.820
Taking names, taking numbers.
Join our righteous frat.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.990
If you ain't pledging Sigma
Beta, you ain't worth no crap.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.827
That's a double negative.
That's a lot of negatives.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.331
Follow me. There's only one group
on this campus worth joining.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.210
As far as Barden goes, that's
what being a man's all about.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.432
The Treblemakers.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.560
The rock stars of a cappella,
the messiahs of Barden.

10:03.645 --> 10:08.023
Well, you know, not including athletes,
frat guys, or actual cool people.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.943
Organized nerd singing.
This is great.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.779
Yeah, it makes so much
sense. How's your voice?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.494
Oh, nice.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.874
I will stop at nothing to
take those ding-a-lings down.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.670
Hey, Barb. You gonna audition
this year? We have openings.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.463
Now that you've
puked your way to the bottom,

10:31.548 --> 10:32.923
you might actually consider me?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.634
I auditioned for you three
times and never got in

10:35.719 --> 10:38.220
because you said
my boobs look like baloney.

10:39.556 --> 10:43.309
The word's out. Bellas is the
laughing stock of a cappella.

10:43.935 --> 10:47.604
Good luck auditioning
this year. Douche-b's.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.275
Oh, my God. This is a travesty.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.361
God, if we can't even recruit Baloney
Barb, then we can't get anybody.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.966
Just take the dramatics down a notch, okay?
Hi, do you wanna...

10:56.990 --> 10:58.657
Well, you're the one
who got us into this hot mess.

10:58.742 --> 10:59.700
We'll be fine.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.493
I am confident
that we will find

11:01.578 --> 11:04.371
eight super-hot girls
with bikini-ready bodies

11:04.456 --> 11:07.416
who can harmonize
and have perfect pitch. Okay?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.419
Hi, would you like to
be a member of...

11:11.546 --> 11:15.341
Just keep flyering.
We have tradition to uphold.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.509
How about we just
get good singers?

11:17.927 --> 11:20.262
- What? Good singers? What?
- Hi.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.097
- Can you sing?
- Yeah.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.350
- Can you read music?
- Yeah.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.852
- Can you match pitch?
- Try me.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.533
Yeah.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.047
That was a really good start.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.801
I'm the best singer
in Tasmania. With teeth.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.302
- Love it.
- What's your name?

12:00.470 --> 12:01.720
Fat Amy.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.807
You call yourself Fat Amy?

12:05.016 --> 12:08.060
Yeah, so twig bitches like you
don't do it behind my back.

12:11.064 --> 12:15.484
I will see you in
auditions, Fat Amy.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.364
I can sing but I'm also
good at modern dance,

12:20.448 --> 12:24.118
olden dance, and
mermaid dancing,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.078
which is a little different.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.664
You usually start
on the ground.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.334
It's a lot of floor work.
I see that.

12:42.887 --> 12:47.224
Yeah, DJs. Deaf Jews.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.186
Shalom!

12:51.938 --> 12:54.106
That's not a real word
but keep trying.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.983
You will get there.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.777
Not a lot of Jewish people
where you're from?

12:59.988 --> 13:02.906
No. I did do Fiddler on the
Roof, though, in high school.

13:02.991 --> 13:06.702
It was, like, me and some Aboriginals.
It was really Jewish.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.954
It was full-on Jew.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.375
Hey, guys. All right,
I'll give you my number.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.588
What about her?

13:18.715 --> 13:22.092
I don't know. She looks a
little too alternative for us.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.595
Hi, any interest in joining
our a cappella group?

13:25.722 --> 13:28.056
Oh, right, this is,
like, a thing now.

13:28.850 --> 13:32.936
Totes. We sing covers of songs but
we do it without any instruments.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.480
It's all from our mouths.

13:34.898 --> 13:35.898
Yikes.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.860
There's four groups on campus. The Bellas.
That's us. We're the tits.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.320
The BU Harmonics.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.572
They sing a lot of Madonna.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.408
The High Notes.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.870
They're not particularly
motivated.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.455
And then there's...

13:57.921 --> 13:59.254
So, are you interested?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.632
Sorry, it just,
it's pretty lame.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.510
A-ca-scuse me?

14:04.594 --> 14:08.639
Synchronized lady dancing to a Mariah
Carey chart topper is not lame.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.767
We sing all over the world and we
compete in national championships.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.644
On purpose?

14:13.728 --> 14:16.855
We played the Cobb Energy
Performing Arts Centre, you bitch!

14:18.274 --> 14:21.527
What Aubrey means to say
is that we are a close-knit,

14:21.819 --> 14:23.779
talented group of ladies
whose dream is

14:23.863 --> 14:27.199
to return to the national finals
at Lincoln Center this year.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.660
Help us turn our dreams
into a reality?

14:30.662 --> 14:34.414
Sorry, I don't even sing, but it
was really nice to meet you guys.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.129
What are we gonna do?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.674
When you came in and you were
just strumming the guitar,

14:43.758 --> 14:46.134
and it was, like, totally
off-key, I wanted to choke you!

14:46.219 --> 14:47.970
Bumper.
I wanted to choke you out!

14:48.054 --> 14:50.347
Okay, I'm gonna
go introduce myself.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.391
Everybody be cool.
It's just a normal day.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.896
Hi. Hi.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.731
Benjamin Applebaum.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.693
I saw you guys perform at a Mall
of America like three years ago.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.498
Totally changed my life. I have not
stopped thinking about you since.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.823
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.826
And, Bumper, huge fan.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.412
Your arrangement of Lovin'
Spoonful's Do You Believe in Magic

15:13.496 --> 15:17.708
inspired me to become
a certified illusionist.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.588
The smell of your weird is
actually affecting my vocal cords,

15:22.672 --> 15:25.716
so I'm gonna need you
to scoot. Skedaddle.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.634
But why don't we just
exchange emails,

15:27.719 --> 15:29.520
and then totally hang out
right now, together?

15:29.554 --> 15:32.639
No. Hard pass. Hard pass.

15:33.349 --> 15:38.228
What a nerd alert. Okay,
guys, now let's match pitch.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.441
- Too far.
- You think?

15:42.525 --> 15:44.443
Yeah. Should I have
done another trick?

15:44.527 --> 15:47.863
No, I think your trick was fine. I just
think the talking was a little weird.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.698
Maybe you can try to
Facebook message him.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.459
Hey, I'm Beca.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.586
- Over there.
- Thanks.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.556
Ninety-five point seven, WBUJ,
music for the independent mind.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.663
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.068
Have you been
standing there long?

16:39.540 --> 16:43.585
No. No, I just got here,
I wasn't just standing here.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.255
- Freshmen aren't allowed in the booth.
- Sorry.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.467
I'm Luke. Station manager.
You must be Becky the intern?

16:51.094 --> 16:52.135
It's...

16:52.220 --> 16:53.762
Hey, man, what's up? I'm Jesse.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.931
I'm Luke. You're late.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.559
Hey. I know you.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.936
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.521
- He doesn't.
- Totally know her.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.405
Okay, cool. Well, you guys can figure
it out while you're stacking CDs.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.942
When you're done, there's more.

17:07.276 --> 17:11.405
Now, you guys will be spending a lot
of down time together, so please, just

17:11.489 --> 17:12.656
no sex on the desk.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.366
I've been burned before.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.872
I do know you. I sang to you. I
remember because you were in a taxi.

17:20.998 --> 17:24.126
- Wait, is your dad a taxi driver?
- No.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.049
This sucks. I wanted
to play music.

17:31.718 --> 17:36.179
Not me. I'm here for one reason only.
I really love stacking CDs.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.766
So, what's your deal?

17:39.851 --> 17:42.936
You one of those girls
who's all dark and mysterious,

17:43.020 --> 17:45.897
then she takes off her glasses and
that amazingly scary ear spike

17:45.982 --> 17:48.734
and you realize that, you know,
she was beautiful the whole time.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.777
I don't wear glasses.
Then you're halfway there.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.492
Beca.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.369
Beca, wake up.

18:42.914 --> 18:46.124
Funny, this doesn't look like
your Intro to Philosophy class.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.127
I'm posing an important
philosophical question.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.880
If I don't actually go to that
class, will it still suck?

18:52.590 --> 18:55.634
Look, honey.
College is... It's great.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.386
You get to create memories
here, I see it every day.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.305
You just have to
give it a chance.

19:00.389 --> 19:04.059
You've been here, what, a month now?
Do you have any friends?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.728
- Kimmy Jin is my friend.
- No.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.066
You gotta get out there, Bec.
You gotta try something.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.609
I got a job at
the radio station.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.902
Oh, great, that place.

19:13.986 --> 19:18.406
Yeah, it's dark and dirty and has like,
what, those three weirdos who work there?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.991
Well, four now.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.662
You gotta try something new,
Bec. Join one club on campus.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.915
And if, at the end of a year,
you still don't wanna be here,

19:27.333 --> 19:31.378
you still wanna go off to
LA and be P. Diddy,

19:31.963 --> 19:34.798
well, then, you can
quit college.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.259
And I will help you move to LA.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.511
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.179
But I really need
to see it, Beca.

19:41.931 --> 19:45.183
This is college. Join in.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.056
- You can sing!
- Dude!

20:25.683 --> 20:27.517
- How high does your belt go?
- My what?

20:27.894 --> 20:30.020
- Oh, my God!
- You have to audition for the Bellas.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.814
I can't concentrate on anything you're
saying until you cover your junk.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.399
Just consider it.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.402
One time, we sang
backup for Prince.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.155
His butt is so tiny that I can
hold it with, like, one hand.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.657
Oops!

20:42.742 --> 20:45.452
Seriously. I am nude.

20:45.536 --> 20:46.828
You were singing
Titanium, right?

20:48.289 --> 20:51.791
- You know David Guetta?
- Have I been living under a rock? Yeah.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.960
That song is my jam.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.587
My lady-jam.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.047
That's nice.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.674
It is. That song really builds.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.261
- Gross.
- Can you sing it for me?

21:03.638 --> 21:05.055
Dude, no. Get out!

21:05.139 --> 21:09.142
Not for that reason. I'm not
leaving here till you sing. So...

21:56.315 --> 22:01.569
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty
confident about all this.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.530
You should be.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.579
Still need to shower.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.499
You have a lovely voice.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.418
Thanks.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.259
Yeah. See you at auditions!

22:24.343 --> 22:27.012
For your audition, each of you
will be singing sixteen bars

22:27.096 --> 22:29.389
of Kelly Clarkson's
Since You've Been Gone.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.851
If a group likes you, they
will contact you directly.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.104
My tone-deaf sidekick Justin here
will be collecting your information.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.523
If I could sing a lick,
in any human way possible,

22:38.607 --> 22:40.817
I would, but I can't.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.903
- And I hate myself every day because of it!
- I know.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.907
But if you think this is
just some high school club,

22:47.992 --> 22:51.911
where you can sing and dance your
way through any big social issue,

22:52.121 --> 22:54.080
or confused sexuality,

22:54.165 --> 22:56.291
you have come to
the wrong place.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.335
There is none of that here.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.879
That's high school.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.798
This shit is real life!

23:03.883 --> 23:08.386
Now, don't just bring it,
sing it. And let's do this.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.979
Hey, Bellas, remember when you tried to
play in the big leagues and you choked?

23:18.564 --> 23:20.244
That should really be
a lesson to everyone.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.068
If you sing the same boring,
girly shit every year,

23:23.319 --> 23:25.320
you will blow chunks.
All over the place.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.072
Vomit everywhere.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.656
My fellow a-ca-people.

23:29.325 --> 23:33.745
We will not let egotistical,
big-headed, garbage dirtballs,

23:34.080 --> 23:36.998
whoever you may be,
get in our way.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.333
I promise you,

23:38.834 --> 23:42.462
we will return to the IcCAs and
finish what we started last year.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.841
And here's the first
one up. Good luck.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.302
Whenever you're ready, dude.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.681
Yeah, hi, my name
is Cynthia Rose.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.851
Not a dude. It's not a dude.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.671
There's no backup
dancers? Okay.

24:25.214 --> 24:29.300
Hello. My name is Lilly Onakuramara.
I have gills like a fish.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.594
I'm sorry. What was that?

24:33.305 --> 24:37.016
Hello. My name is Lilly Onakuramara.
I was born with gills like a fish.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.481
One, two, three, four.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.417
Hi, everybody,
my name is Stacie.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.087
My hobbies include cuticle
care and the E! Network.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.398
It's high.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.152
Jesus.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.280
Thank you.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.908
Performing live gives
me such a rush.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.457
Crushed it.

26:24.833 --> 26:29.963
Okay. That is everybody. I'm really
not that impressed this year, guys.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.508
Oh, wait, there's one more.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.260
Hi.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.303
Hello.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.808
I didn't know we had
to prepare that song.

26:41.892 --> 26:44.227
Oh, that's okay. Sing
anything you want.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.523
May I?

27:47.666 --> 27:51.169
The sopranos. Jessica,
Mary Elise, Lilly.

27:51.253 --> 27:55.214
The mezzos. Cynthia
Rose, Stacie, Kori.

27:55.299 --> 27:59.969
And our altos. Fat Amy,
Denise, Ashley, and Beca.

28:01.972 --> 28:07.935
We shall begin by drinking the blood
of the sisters that came before you.

28:08.645 --> 28:11.230
- Dude, no.
- Don't worry, it's Boone's Farm.

28:12.358 --> 28:16.361
Well, well, well,
look who's in treble.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.239
- Classic pun.
- I know.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.036
No Benji?

28:25.120 --> 28:27.997
Now, if you'll place your
scarves in your right hand.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.959
I, sing your name...

28:32.252 --> 28:33.294
I...

28:37.883 --> 28:41.636
promise to fulfill the duties and
responsibilities of a Bella woman.

28:42.096 --> 28:46.349
Promise to fulfill the duties and
responsibilities of a Bella woman.

28:46.642 --> 28:50.895
And I solemnly promise to never have
sexual relations with a Treblemaker

28:50.979 --> 28:54.023
or may my vocal cords
be ripped out by wolves.

28:54.525 --> 28:59.529
And I solemnly promise to never have
sexual relations with a Treblemaker

28:59.988 --> 29:03.574
or may my vocal cords
be ripped out by wolves.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.494
You are all Bellas now.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.666
We did it.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.960
I want some more of this.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.921
Did we?

29:21.802 --> 29:24.595
Ladies, welcome
to a-ca-initiation night.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.181
Prepare to soften the beach.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.019
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.565
Just living the dream. I still can't
believe they let my sexy fat ass in.

29:35.649 --> 29:37.733
Beca! Beca!

29:39.153 --> 29:41.779
Be-caw! Be-caw.

29:42.823 --> 29:45.324
Do my eyes deceive me
or are you a Barden Bella?

29:45.409 --> 29:47.577
- No.
- You're one of those a cappella girls,

29:47.661 --> 29:50.997
I'm one of those a cappella boys,
and we're gonna have a-ca-children.

29:51.081 --> 29:53.040
It's inevitable.
You're really drunk right now.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.542
I don't think you're gonna
remember any of this.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.835
No. I'm not drunk at
all, you're just blurry.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.378
- You okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.422
- You almost fell over?
- No, she didn't. You know, I could...

29:59.548 --> 30:00.965
- Can you pass a sobriety test right now?
- Yep.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.592
Can you stand up straight?
See how I come right back?

30:02.676 --> 30:05.136
- And I come right back.
- Right.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.304
Can I get you a drink?

30:06.388 --> 30:08.055
It sounds great.

30:08.182 --> 30:09.390
- I'm gonna get you a drink.
- Go for it.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.684
I think you need to
get on this level.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.352
Please be careful.

30:13.437 --> 30:14.812
Hi.

30:15.189 --> 30:17.523
I am so glad that I met you.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.943
I think that we're gonna
be really fast friends.

30:21.278 --> 30:24.322
- Yeah. Well, you saw me naked, so...
- Yeah.

30:24.406 --> 30:29.911
Yeah. Yeah, ladies. Gather around.
Ready for a show.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.663
- Come on, baby bubble, wait in line. Yep.
- Yeah.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.665
- You want some of this.
- I know you do.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.543
- Nice.
- Bumper and Donald.

30:38.086 --> 30:41.714
Getting it.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.967
You know, so there's
like 10 of us.-

30:45.052 --> 30:48.012
That means that one of us
is probably a lesbian.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.598
You think? Which one
do you think it is?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.892
My money's on Black Beauty.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.685
So, when I drink
too much tonight,

30:54.770 --> 30:58.064
can I count on you to hold
my hair back if I puke?

31:00.317 --> 31:01.734
Don't tell her I said that.

31:02.027 --> 31:05.446
All right. I'm gonna go get a drink.
This ginger needs her jiggle juice.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.574
See you later.
Make good choices.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.370
I thought of a new
name for this hairstyle.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.830
It's called the Orthodox
Jew ponytail.

31:14.915 --> 31:15.915
Yeah?

31:16.041 --> 31:18.161
- 'Cause it's very reserved at the front...
- I see that.

31:18.168 --> 31:20.795
But party in the back.
I see these happening here.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.724
Here's the real question.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.130
Who would be easier
to sleep with?

31:35.143 --> 31:36.852
Captain America or
a great white shark?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.396
- Great white shark. I wouldn't...
- Hey.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.041
What are you turd
burgers talking about?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.108
Dressing for comfort?

31:42.192 --> 31:46.862
You are probably the grossest
human being I've ever seen.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.490
Well, you're no
panty-dropper yourself.

31:50.158 --> 31:54.662
So I have a feeling
that we should kiss.

31:54.746 --> 31:58.207
And is that feeling a good
feeling or an incorrect feeling?

31:58.292 --> 32:00.835
Well, I sometimes have a
feeling I can do crystal meth,

32:00.961 --> 32:03.963
- but then I think, "Better not."
- Yeah.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.975
I don't know the words,
but I can...

32:16.310 --> 32:17.643
Thank you.

32:19.521 --> 32:20.605
This is awesome.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.523
It's definitely something.

32:22.899 --> 32:25.484
We are the kings of campus!

32:51.011 --> 32:53.179
Man, the old Bellas was hot!

32:53.263 --> 32:55.139
Yeah, they kept it tight.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.726
Okay. Sopranos in the front
and altos in the back.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.647
As you can see,
Kori is not here.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.857
Last night she
was Treble-boned.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.901
She has been disinvited
from the Bellas.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.069
That oath was serious?

33:08.695 --> 33:09.987
Dixie Chicks serious.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.282
You can fool around with whoever
you want to, just not a Treble.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.577
That's not gonna be
easy. He's a hunter.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.496
You call it a dude?

33:18.580 --> 33:21.165
Stacie, the Trebles
don't respect us,

33:21.249 --> 33:22.875
and if we let them
penetrate us,

33:24.795 --> 33:27.129
Not a good enough reason
to use the word "penetrate."

33:27.214 --> 33:31.801
So, does anyone here
have anything to confess?

33:38.934 --> 33:40.559
It was an accident. I...

33:40.644 --> 33:41.936
Turn in your scarf and go.

33:56.410 --> 33:57.702
Slut.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.121
Take your chair.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.467
Was that necessary?

34:14.844 --> 34:17.304
This is war, Beca,

34:17.389 --> 34:20.891
and it is my job to make sure that
my soldiers are prepped at go time

34:20.976 --> 34:24.061
with three kick-ass songs sung
and choreographed to perfection.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.362
And there are only four
months until regionals.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.524
So, if you have a problem with
the way that I run the Bellas,

34:28.608 --> 34:30.192
then you should just...

34:33.155 --> 34:35.030
Don't stress, Aubrey. Relax.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.158
We don't want a repeat of
what happened last year.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.161
What happened last year?

34:41.663 --> 34:42.746
What are you saying?

34:43.873 --> 34:45.331
What happened last year?

34:47.835 --> 34:50.212
And do you guys wanna
see a dead body?

35:00.640 --> 35:01.766
Click on "Guy Pukes on Cat."

35:01.850 --> 35:03.642
Enough! It happened. It's over.

35:04.519 --> 35:08.272
We will practice every day for at
least two hours, seven days a week.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.957
And I trust you will
add your own cardio.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.444
- Why cardio?
- Yeah, no, don't put me down for cardio.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.070
Okay, moving on.

35:15.155 --> 35:18.240
This is a list of all of the songs
that we have ever performed.

35:18.325 --> 35:21.952
And you will notice that we only
do songs made famous by women.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.677
There's nothing from
this century on here.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.581
Because we don't
stray from tradition.

35:27.250 --> 35:32.838
Now, this is how we
will become champions.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.566
Come on, girls! Let's go!

35:52.651 --> 35:54.485
Go, go, go! Pick up your knees!

35:54.569 --> 35:56.737
Faster, faster! One, two,
one, two, one, two!

35:56.822 --> 36:00.282
Knees up, knees up!
Go, go! Go! Let's get it.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.286
Yes, Chloe. Nice. Amy!

36:05.997 --> 36:07.414
What are you doing?

36:07.499 --> 36:09.291
I'm doing horizontal running.

36:09.376 --> 36:10.668
Horizontal running?

36:20.428 --> 36:22.096
No.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.474
No, no.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.395
No.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.006
I know... I can do it.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.727
Five, six, seven, eight.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.441
Okay, I'm calling it.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.986
Thank God. I asked to go to
the bathroom three hours ago.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.323
Nothing. I hear nothing.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.577
Hey, Aubrey. Did we just learn the
same choreography from that video?

37:27.078 --> 37:29.622
Okay. Don't forget to pick up
your performance schedules.

37:29.706 --> 37:33.584
We have a gig next week.
That's right. Next week.

37:33.668 --> 37:36.462
You guys, it's the Sigma Beta
Theta's Annual Fall Mixer.

37:36.546 --> 37:39.006
Okay. Hands in, Bellas.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.385
- Hands in, a-ca-bitches!
- Okay.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.096
Sing "ah" on three...

37:48.391 --> 37:52.603
No, no, no. It's actually
on three, Fat Amy.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.482
All right. On three.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.108
One, two...

38:02.405 --> 38:05.157
Okay, we will work on that
first thing next time.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.368
- Okay, guys.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.786
She has man hands.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.496
Beca, a word?

38:11.331 --> 38:12.373
What's up?

38:13.124 --> 38:16.377
You know you'll have to take those ear
monstrosities out for the Fall Mixer.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.158
You really don't
like me, do you?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.464
I don't like your attitude.
You don't even know me.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.383
I know you have
a toner for Jesse.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.009
A what?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.636
A toner.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.639
A musical boner. I saw it at Hood Night.
It's distracting.

38:28.848 --> 38:32.559
Yeah, that's not a thing and
you're not the boss of me. So...

38:32.852 --> 38:34.311
You took an oath.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.022
That oath cost you two
girls already today.

38:37.107 --> 38:39.027
I'm pretty sure you need
me more than I need you.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.672
I can see your toner
through those jeans.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.991
That's my dick.

38:49.828 --> 38:50.953
Everything okay?

38:51.037 --> 38:54.081
We better have our
shit together for SBT.

38:54.165 --> 38:58.002
I'm not worried. I think
we're gonna be a-ca-awesome.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.236
This makes my beer taste bad.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.702
I'm gonna stop this.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.623
Just stop. Stop.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.670
I am so sorry, Howie. I know
we're not performance ready.

39:41.755 --> 39:45.632
I wanted the hot Bellas,
not this barnyard explosion.

39:46.051 --> 39:49.219
- I'm not paying for this. Let's go. Come on.
- God.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.805
Well, I hope you all remember
the way you feel right now,

39:51.890 --> 39:54.016
so you will never wanna
feel this way again.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.686
Chloe, your voice didn't
sound Aguilerian at all.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.731
Chloe, for serious,
what is wrong with you?

40:00.815 --> 40:02.191
I have nodes.

40:02.275 --> 40:05.736
What? Oh, my God.
I found out this morning.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.613
What are nodes?

40:07.697 --> 40:09.198
Vocal nodules.

40:09.783 --> 40:12.326
The rubbing together of your vocal
cords at above-average rates

40:12.410 --> 40:14.078
without proper lubrication.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.330
They sit on your windpipe
and they crush your dreams.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.333
Isn't that painful?
Why would you keep performing?

40:19.709 --> 40:21.418
Because I love to sing.

40:21.503 --> 40:24.088
Yeah, it's like when my lady doctor
told me not to have sex for six weeks,

40:24.172 --> 40:25.380
and I did it anyway.

40:25.465 --> 40:28.133
You should really
listen to your doctor.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.303
The key is early diagnosis.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.223
I am living with nodes.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.600
But I am a survivor.

40:36.893 --> 40:40.395
I just have to pull back.
Because I am limited.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.565
Because I have nodes.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.526
Chloe, this is horrible.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.444
Well, at least it's not herpes.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.532
Or do you have that as well?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.618
- Jesse?
- Yeah.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.328
I'm starving, so could you...

41:38.496 --> 41:39.746
You want me to get you lunch?

41:40.665 --> 41:42.226
You should probably
lay off the burgers.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.101
You're not gonna
be 22 forever, you know.

41:45.712 --> 41:47.588
Yeah, I think I'm good.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.756
He's good. You're good.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.843
And the chess match continues.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.516
Hey, this is my new mix,

41:59.976 --> 42:01.602
so if there's anything
you wanted to play...

42:01.686 --> 42:03.353
Yeah, okay, I'll
put it on the pile.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.980
Okay.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.070
What's up, weirdo?

42:12.155 --> 42:13.697
Okay.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.285
- What's this?
- As much as I love

42:18.369 --> 42:20.579
spending time with you stacking CDs...
And I do.

42:20.663 --> 42:22.831
I love it, like,
more than life.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.917
I figured we could do
some other fun things

42:25.001 --> 42:26.877
that don't make us wanna
kill ourselves, right?

42:26.961 --> 42:29.504
- Yeah.
- So, brought some movies.

42:30.048 --> 42:35.719
Jaws, E.T., The Breakfast
Club, Star Wars and Rocky.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.597
Best scored and soundtracked
movies of all time.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.975
That's what I wanna do when I grow up.
I wanna score movies.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.020
Bring people to tears,
you know. Blow their minds.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.647
I feel like only
music can do that.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.065
Yeah.

42:48.149 --> 42:49.691
You must really sweep
your girlfriend off her feet.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.109
I don't have a girlfriend.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.361
- What?
- No.

42:52.445 --> 42:54.738
You have juice
pouches and Rocky.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.282
Okay, so what do you
wanna watch first?

42:57.367 --> 42:58.492
Wanna do something else?

42:58.993 --> 43:01.245
We could relive
my parents' divorce.

43:01.329 --> 43:02.663
Or visit a gynecologist.

43:03.331 --> 43:04.971
What, do you not like
movies or something?

43:06.292 --> 43:07.572
Like, any movies? You don't...

43:07.877 --> 43:11.129
What the hell is wrong with you?
How do you not like movies?

43:11.214 --> 43:14.007
Not liking movies is like
not liking puppies.

43:14.092 --> 43:16.551
They're fine. I just get bored
and never make it to the end.

43:16.970 --> 43:18.929
The endings are the best part.

43:19.222 --> 43:21.890
They're predictable.
Like, the guy gets the girl,

43:21.975 --> 43:25.644
and that kid sees dead people and
Darth Vader is Luke's father.

43:25.728 --> 43:29.439
Okay, right, so you just happened to guess
the biggest cinematic reveal in history?

43:29.941 --> 43:32.109
"Vader" in German means father.

43:32.193 --> 43:34.695
His name is literally
"Darth Father."

43:37.198 --> 43:38.365
So, you know German.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.326
Well, now I know
why you don't like fun things.

43:41.411 --> 43:43.495
You know, you need
a movie education.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.914
You need a movie-cation.
And I'm gonna give it to you.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.834
Yeah, in between Bella
rehearsals, which are always.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.139
Are you guys getting
ready for the riff-off?

43:52.171 --> 43:53.714
What the hell is a riff-off?

43:57.010 --> 43:58.135
Hit it!

44:02.390 --> 44:04.516
Welcome to the riff-off!

44:07.312 --> 44:08.729
Who's ready to get vocal?

44:11.107 --> 44:12.566
The winners get
the greatest prize of all.

44:12.650 --> 44:13.650
I'm taking you down.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.485
- The microphone used by Hoobastank...
- I don't care.

44:15.570 --> 44:18.155
When they rocked out at the
Schnee Performing Arts Center.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.742
Let's see our first category.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.042
Ladies of the '80s.

44:37.175 --> 44:40.135

44:40.219 --> 44:43.096
Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey

44:43.598 --> 44:44.639
Mickey, you're so fine...

44:44.724 --> 44:46.975
You're so fine and you're mine

44:47.810 --> 44:51.938
I'll be yours till
the end of time.

44:52.023 --> 44:55.525
'Cause you made me feel.

44:55.610 --> 44:59.279
Yeah, you made me feel.

44:59.364 --> 45:02.032
So shiny and new.

45:03.618 --> 45:04.701
Like a virgin.

45:04.786 --> 45:05.911
Okay, guys.

45:06.621 --> 45:11.416
Touched for the very first time.

45:11.501 --> 45:14.336
Like the one in me That's okay.

45:14.629 --> 45:20.133
Let's see how you do it Put up
your dukes, let's get down to it!

45:20.301 --> 45:23.303
Hit me with your best shot.

45:23.388 --> 45:26.139
Why don't you hit me
with your best shot.

45:27.809 --> 45:30.227
Hit me with your best shot.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.938
Fire away.

45:35.942 --> 45:37.901
It must have been love.

45:39.237 --> 45:42.823
But it's over now.

45:43.825 --> 45:45.992
But it's over right now.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.662
The negative side effects
of medical marijuana, folks.

45:48.746 --> 45:49.871
You are...

45:50.123 --> 45:51.540
Cut off!

45:51.916 --> 45:54.751
Stoney baloney. Let's check
out our next category.

45:55.211 --> 45:57.295
So, we just pick any
song that works?

45:57.380 --> 46:01.174
Yeah, any song.
And you just go with it? Nice.

46:15.356 --> 46:19.025
'Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it.

46:19.235 --> 46:23.113
Sex in the air, I don't care
I love the smell of it.

46:23.197 --> 46:26.283
Sticks and stones
May break my bones.

46:26.367 --> 46:30.537
But chains and whips Excite me.

46:30.872 --> 46:34.374
'Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it.

46:34.459 --> 46:38.128
Sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me.

46:38.212 --> 46:43.091
Let's talk about all the good things
and the bad things that may be.

46:43.176 --> 46:45.051
Let's talk about sex.

46:45.678 --> 46:48.054

Baby, all through the night

46:52.268 --> 46:56.730
I'll make love to you
Like you want me to.

46:57.231 --> 47:00.650
And I guess it's just
the woman in you.

47:01.611 --> 47:05.655
That brings out the man in me

47:06.115 --> 47:10.035
I know I can't help myself.

47:10.119 --> 47:13.538
You're all in the world to me.

47:15.333 --> 47:18.418
It feels like the first time.

47:19.462 --> 47:22.672
It feels like the
very first time.

47:23.591 --> 47:27.093
It feels like the first time.

47:27.178 --> 47:30.388
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations.

47:30.473 --> 47:32.849
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch.

47:32.934 --> 47:35.727
As long as my credit can vouch a
dog couldn't catch me straight up.

47:35.811 --> 47:38.897
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin'
moves attracting honeys like a magnet.

47:38.981 --> 47:41.775
Giving 'em eargasms
with my mellow accent.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.945
Still moving this flavor With the
homies Blackstreet and Teddy.

47:45.404 --> 47:47.614
The original rump shakers.

Keep going.

47:55.623 --> 47:58.833
Shorty get down, good Lord.

48:03.172 --> 48:05.507
Strictly biz, she
don't play around.

48:05.591 --> 48:09.052
Cover much ground,
got game by the pound.

48:09.136 --> 48:11.263
Getting paid is her forte.

48:11.347 --> 48:13.473
Each and every day,
true player way

48:14.141 --> 48:16.351
I can't get her out of my mind.

48:16.561 --> 48:17.602
Okay.

48:17.687 --> 48:19.312
I think about the
girl all the time

48:20.147 --> 48:23.233
I like the way you

49:03.024 --> 49:04.608
It's a tough blow, ladies.

49:04.692 --> 49:08.361
The word you needed to match was
"it." And you sang, "it's."

49:08.446 --> 49:11.072
- You are...
- Cut off!

49:11.198 --> 49:12.907
Are you serious?
The Trebles win!

49:13.534 --> 49:15.952
Beca, I'm sorry. You lost.

49:16.037 --> 49:19.789
I've never heard that rule! Ladies,
ladies, come on. Come back.

49:20.207 --> 49:21.666
Sorry.

49:22.251 --> 49:23.543
Money in the bank.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.340
Enjoy watching us
win the IcCAs.

49:28.424 --> 49:32.802
On the TV. On a regional
cable affiliate.

49:33.012 --> 49:34.346
Before everybody
goes to bed tonight,

49:34.430 --> 49:36.097
I need you to make a list
of everything you did wrong.

49:36.182 --> 49:38.266
I'm gonna melt that
Cabbage Patch Kid.

49:38.851 --> 49:40.977
Hey, guys, what we just
did was great, right?

49:41.062 --> 49:43.188
Calm your pits, Beca.
We still lost.

49:43.397 --> 49:46.149
Yeah, but it was spontaneous.
It was awesome.

49:46.233 --> 49:47.192
We were actually
listening to...

49:47.276 --> 49:48.652
Okay, everybody, hands in.

49:48.736 --> 49:50.236
"Ah" on my count.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.322
- On three or after three?
- On three.

49:52.406 --> 49:53.990
- After three.
- One, two, three.

49:54.075 --> 49:55.075
That's not how we do it.

49:55.159 --> 49:57.243
Why can't we figure this out?

50:01.248 --> 50:03.833
So, I just find songs that have
the same chord progressions

50:03.918 --> 50:05.752
and create a track that
blends them together.

50:05.836 --> 50:08.296
So, like, this is
the new bass line,

50:08.881 --> 50:11.591
and this is matching
up downbeats.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.428
I'm talking really loud.

50:16.138 --> 50:17.764
That's me singing.

50:28.609 --> 50:30.193
This is really good.

50:30.528 --> 50:32.320
Now I'm the one yelling, right?

50:34.573 --> 50:35.782
That is amazing, Beca.

50:36.575 --> 50:37.826
Thanks.

50:38.953 --> 50:41.037
So, I brought this over,

50:41.122 --> 50:44.165
because I wanna watch you
watch the end of this movie.

50:45.418 --> 50:47.043
And then I can die a hero.

50:51.632 --> 50:53.007
Wait, actually...

50:54.468 --> 50:56.594
You have a habit of making yourself
at home, did you know that?

50:56.679 --> 50:57.804
Yeah.

51:05.896 --> 51:06.980
Okay.

51:08.482 --> 51:10.817
The Breakfast Club. 1985.

51:10.901 --> 51:13.153
Greatest ending
to any movie ever.

51:13.946 --> 51:16.531
This song launched
Simple Minds in the US.

51:16.615 --> 51:19.117
Could have been a Billy ldol
song, but he turned it down.

51:19.535 --> 51:20.535
Idiot.

51:21.120 --> 51:25.039
Perfectly sums up the movie.
It's equally beautiful and sad.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.418
That is fascinating.

51:28.502 --> 51:29.669
Right?

51:30.171 --> 51:33.131
Tell me, what does Judd
Nelson eat for breakfast?

51:33.215 --> 51:36.843
Oh, well, like all misunderstood
rebels, he feeds on hypocrisy.

51:36.927 --> 51:37.969
Sure.

51:38.053 --> 51:41.222
And black coffee to help
with his morning dumps.

51:42.558 --> 51:43.600
You're an idiot.

51:43.684 --> 51:45.769
It's true. I'm full
of fun facts.

51:45.853 --> 51:47.937
You should let other people
tell you they're fun.

51:48.022 --> 51:49.022
And an athlete.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.441
And a basket case.

51:51.525 --> 51:52.901
A princess.

51:52.985 --> 51:54.527
And a criminal.

51:54.862 --> 51:56.946
Does that answer your question?

51:57.740 --> 52:00.617
Sincerely yours,
the Breakfast Club.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.040
You're missing the ending.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.291
Sorry.

52:18.928 --> 52:21.638
It's good. I'm sure
the beginning is...

52:24.308 --> 52:26.017
The white girl is back.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.731
And I'm out.

52:35.319 --> 52:37.529
Always a pleasure, Kimmy Jin.

52:40.407 --> 52:42.742
So... Excuse me. Excuse me.

52:57.925 --> 53:00.426
I should have taken that
cardio tip more seriously.

53:00.511 --> 53:01.678
How much have you done?

53:01.762 --> 53:03.054
You just saw it.

53:03.138 --> 53:05.265
Chloe, you gotta be
able to hit that last note.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.058
I can't. It's impossible.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.935
And it's because of
my, my nodes.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.186
Her nodes. Her nodes.

53:10.271 --> 53:13.106
Well, if you can't do it, then
someone else needs to solo.

53:13.941 --> 53:15.733
I think Beca should
take my solo.

53:15.943 --> 53:18.069
Yeah, Beca would be excellent.

53:18.153 --> 53:21.865
But also, someone else
might be equally as excellent.

53:22.908 --> 53:25.535
It's true.
And they might be shy

53:25.619 --> 53:28.037
and not wanna come forward
and say they wanted a solo.

53:28.122 --> 53:31.541
Well, Beca doesn't
want a solo, so...

53:31.625 --> 53:33.042
I would be happy to do it

53:33.127 --> 53:34.794
if I got to pick a new song
and do an arrangement.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.713
Well, that's not how
we run things here.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.799
Aubrey, maybe Beca has a point.
Maybe we could try something new.

53:39.884 --> 53:40.967
A-ca-scuse me?

53:42.094 --> 53:45.763
You can sing Turn the Beat Around and
that's the last I wanna hear of this.

53:46.765 --> 53:49.517
That song is tired.
We're not gonna win with it.

53:49.602 --> 53:51.185
If we pull samples
from different genres

53:51.270 --> 53:52.520
and layer them together,
we could make some...

53:52.605 --> 53:55.648
Okay, let me explain something to you
because you still don't seem to get it.

53:55.983 --> 53:59.319
Our goal is to get back to the finals
and these songs will get us there.

53:59.820 --> 54:03.948
So, excuse me if I don't take advice from
some alt-girl with her mad lib beats,

54:04.033 --> 54:05.909
because she's never even
been in competition.

54:05.993 --> 54:07.285
Have I made myself clear?

54:07.786 --> 54:09.662
Crystal. I won't solo.

54:10.289 --> 54:11.372
Fine.

54:11.957 --> 54:13.708
- Fat Amy?
- Yes, sir?

54:13.834 --> 54:15.084
You'll solo.

54:16.337 --> 54:19.631
Yes! Yes.

54:41.278 --> 54:42.478
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

54:42.488 --> 54:46.491
The 2012 southeastern regional
competition has officially begun.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.701
Yes, I'm Gail Abernathy McCadd,

54:48.786 --> 54:51.245
and to my right is fellow a
cappella alum John Smith

54:51.330 --> 54:54.165
and we are live from
Carolina University.

54:54.249 --> 54:56.501
It's a new season
for a cappella.

54:56.585 --> 54:59.504
The regionals begin the
long road to Lincoln Center

54:59.588 --> 55:02.465
where all of these youngsters
hope to one day win a trophy

55:02.549 --> 55:04.550
by making music
with their mouths.

55:16.814 --> 55:19.899
A cappella out of
sock puppets? Genius.

55:20.234 --> 55:22.276
Yeah, look at the black
one with the white sock.

55:22.361 --> 55:23.486
It's making a statement.

55:23.570 --> 55:26.239
There's no craft there. Watching
them will make you worse.

55:26.573 --> 55:27.907
At least they're different.

55:30.119 --> 55:33.162
And the Sockappellas,
once again proving

55:33.247 --> 55:36.958
that it doesn't get better for
everyone after high school.

55:49.847 --> 55:50.930
Do we clap?

55:51.015 --> 55:52.098
- No, we don't.
- Never.

55:56.478 --> 55:57.770
Hands in.

55:59.189 --> 56:01.858
Remember, "Ah" on three.

56:01.942 --> 56:03.526
One, two...

56:03.610 --> 56:04.902
Wait, you said we'd...

56:06.071 --> 56:07.196
I'm sorry.

56:07.281 --> 56:09.115
It's okay,
it's gonna be okay. Okay.

56:09.199 --> 56:11.075
Let's give it up
for the Barden Bellas!

56:16.582 --> 56:22.628
This does not look like the fresh-faced
nubile Bellas that we have come to know.

56:22.713 --> 56:26.174
Is it me or are those skirts
just not working anymore?

56:26.550 --> 56:27.925
You're walking the line, John.

56:28.010 --> 56:31.554
It's a nice surprise to see
the Bellas mixing it up.

56:31.638 --> 56:35.016
It's refreshing, yet
displeasing to the eye.

56:41.690 --> 56:43.941
One, two, three, four.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.245
The Barden Bellas bringing back

56:56.330 --> 56:59.082
the same song they sang
at last year's finals.

56:59.166 --> 57:02.251
And all eyes will be on
senior Aubrey Posen.

57:02.336 --> 57:04.253
She could toss some
cookies at any moment.

57:27.319 --> 57:30.446
And she makes it through, folks.
No cookie toss.

57:55.764 --> 57:58.975
John, a change of pace could not come
soon enough here for the Barden Bellas.

57:59.268 --> 58:01.769
This is not a great way
to start their season.

58:02.020 --> 58:07.150
Yeah, this number is like an
elephant dart to the public's face.

58:16.076 --> 58:17.118
Oh, yeah!

58:58.493 --> 58:59.493
Yes.

59:07.002 --> 59:08.794
Yeah, Fat Amy.

59:09.296 --> 59:10.421
Boo!

59:10.505 --> 59:13.591
The Barden Bellas went deep into
the archive for that song, John.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.927
I remember singing it
with my own a cappella group.

59:16.011 --> 59:17.470
And what group was that, Gail?

59:17.554 --> 59:18.763
The Minstrel Cycles, John.

59:19.932 --> 59:21.212
Well, that's an
unfortunate name.

59:21.350 --> 59:24.477
Thank you. Really incredible.

59:24.853 --> 59:27.438
The Barden Bellas. Thank you.

59:31.235 --> 59:32.443
That was great.

59:32.527 --> 59:33.569
Amazing.

59:33.654 --> 59:36.572
You know, there must be something in the
water over there at Barden University,

59:36.657 --> 59:38.157
'cause this next group
is also from Barden.

59:38.242 --> 59:43.037
Ladies and gentlemen, the
Barden University Treblemakers.

59:43.163 --> 59:47.083
Here we go, the Barden Treblemakers.
They're on the trail for Lincoln Center?

59:47.167 --> 59:49.210
Absolutely, they
always are, Gail.

59:49.294 --> 59:52.088
My favorite, and
everyone's favorite.

59:52.172 --> 59:55.424
Now it says here in my notes that
their front man Bumper Allen

59:55.509 --> 59:59.095
has recently released his
own line of sports sandals.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:31.460
Boy, the bad boys of a cappella
have just gotten badder.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:32.670
That's right, John.

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:35.798
I'm gonna have to excuse myself
to freshen up the downtown.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.049
Can I help?

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:06.329
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:09.749
The results of tonight's
regional competition.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.752
In third place,
the Sockappellas!

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.078
Yeah, lucky you.
In second place,

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.969
and advancing to this year's
semi-finals, the Barden Bellas.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:23.512
Yeah.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:25.765
Yes!

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.266
Awesome.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.976
Oh, nice. Nice.

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:30.186
Hey,

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:33.356
And the winner of tonight's
regional competition,

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.649
defending their crown,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.235
the Barden University
Treblemakers!

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.737
Way to go, Trebles.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.617
Yes! Yes!

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:48.454
That's right!

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.078
I'm willing to sign breasts.
Yes! I'm willing to sign...

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:32.998
Oh, look who it is. Old dudes.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.834
Get a life.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.710
Sonic boom.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.421
Just 'cause we graduated
a few years ago,

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:41.385
doesn't mean we can't still get off
performing our oral magic, all right?

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:42.466
Oral magic?

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:44.468
Buddy, buddy.

01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:45.928
Are you looking for what I
think you're looking for?

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.346
Yeah, a fight?
You looking for a fight?

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.140
Please, please. Please say
you're looking for a fight.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:52.101
Please, please say
you're looking for a fight.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.437
Yes! I will fight.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.689
I would fight him,

01:02:56.773 --> 01:03:00.860
but I tore a quad within
the midst of the dance...

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:03.195
Hey, Gandhi. Hey, you, are
we doing this or what?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.280
- Hit me.
- What?

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:05.489
Let's get it on!

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:11.328
I've wrestled crocodiles
and dingoes simultaneously.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:12.621
- Come here!
- Why do you want me to hit you?

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:13.747
I don't wanna do that.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:16.125
I need to feel something.
Hit me as hard as you can.

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:18.919
Hit me hard. Take this. Take this.
I want you to hit me with it.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.046
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna check on them.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.341
The kraken has been unleashed.
Feel the Fat Amy force!

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:28.137
Hey.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.890
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:33.934
That's fantastic!

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.728
Amy, don't. Amy!
Feel the fat power.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.189
Fat Amy! Kick me in the balls!

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:40.691
Amy!

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:43.652
Give me the sharp weapon,
I wanna put it up his butt!

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.571
Cherry on top.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:52.453
Which way are you running?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.246
- This way. This way.
- All right.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:55.956
Beautiful.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.416
Amy!

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:58.751
Vertical running.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:00.503
I'm vertical running.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.964
Hey, Hilary Swank from
Million Dollar Baby.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:07.301
Hey, you know you just have to
say, "Hey, Million Dollar Baby."

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:10.137
You don't have to reference
the specific actress.

01:04:10.222 --> 01:04:12.389
Damn. Prison changed you.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:14.683
Thanks for bailing me out.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:15.768
Well, I didn't.

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:17.603
You called my dad?

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.772
I know, I know, but they were
putting you in handcuffs, Bec.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:20.940
It looked pretty serious.

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.525
That doesn't mean
you call my dad.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.735
Who else was I gonna call? Okay,
why are you yelling at me?

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:25.903
I'm the only one here.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.905
I didn't ask you to be.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.900
I was just trying to help you.

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:32.243
I don't need your help,
you're not my boyfriend.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.161
Got it.

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.126
Dad, it's not a big deal.
Yeah, it's a big deal.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:37.706
I get a call in the
middle of the night

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.834
saying my daughter's been arrested
for destruction of property.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.629
It was a misunderstanding and
I was protecting my friends.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.298
I was putting myself
out there. Making memories.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.885
If you think I'm paying for you to
go to LA after a stunt like this,

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.428
I'm not. Get in the car.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.556
You're not even gonna hear
what I have to say about this?

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.391
No, not tonight. Just get in.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:08.654
Hey!

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:11.407
What up, Shawshank?

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:12.783
Did you get yourself a bitch?

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:14.159
Did they spray you with a hose?

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.662
I did a turn at County.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.206
You guys waited up for me?

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:20.823
Of course we waited up for you.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.920
They've been here for hours.
It's a real inconvenience, Beca.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.591
Beca, I'm glad you're here.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.302
I'm calling an
emergency Bella meeting.

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:32.511
No.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.555
- First up...
- Yes.

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.266
Our score sheet revealed that the
Sockappellas almost beat us.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.936
And Fat Amy, you need to do it
exactly how we rehearsed it, okay?

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.021
No surprises.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.315
We should be taking risks.
It's not enough to be good,

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:46.108
we need to put ourselves
out there, be different.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:49.111
Beca's right. The Trebles never
sing the same song twice.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.447
The audience love the
Trebles, they tolerate us.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:54.617
We could change the
face of a cappella if we...

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.181
Oh, my God, that sounded so queerballs.
What's happening to me?

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.956
Let me show you this arrangement
I've been working on.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:02.791
I didn't know
you were into this stuff.

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:03.917
Yeah.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:09.089
Okay, I have the pitch pipe, and I say
that we focus on the set list as planned.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.676
From now on, there will be
no more wasting time with work

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:16.305
or school or boyfriends
or partners.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.474
Sorry, Cynthia Rose.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.852
But Aubrey, this stuff
is pretty cool. I mean...

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:24.104
Okay. Rehearsal tomorrow,
8:00 a.m. sharp.

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:37.701
Hey!

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:42.414
This is my track! You're
playing my song right now!

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:45.209
- That is awesome!
- You like it?

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:48.128
You put it on the
radio! That is amazing!

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.172
It's a sick beat.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:53.384
Yeah, I always thought
her beats were pretty sick.

01:06:53.385 --> 01:06:56.387
Hey, Becky, listen, spring break, I
want you to take the night shift.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.513
Play your music.

01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:02.601
The DJ at the Garage does a brilliant
version of this, but yours? It's better.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.186
Yeah, it is.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.439
I'm gonna listen to her tonight. I think
you should... You should come with.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.066
I have a thing.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.193
Flight attendant training?

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:15.114
It's Barden Bellas. I have
the semi-finals tonight.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:19.201
Really? I did not have you
pegged as an a cappella girl.

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.203
That's 'cause you don't
know Becky like I do.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.705
See you tonight.

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:42.474
Okay, don't you
flat-butts worry, I got this.

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:44.309
I'm just gonna pump and dump.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.520
I don't care what you say.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:49.523
Sisqó live, best performance
ever, I've ever seen.

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:51.400
- "Thong Song" isn't his only hit.
- Yeah.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.155
All right? That's serious.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:57.364
Yo, Bump, is that Fat Amy?

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.075
Donald, slow down! Slow down!

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.910
Yeah! All right!

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:05.038
Hey, Amy? Sabotage!

01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:12.546
I've been shot.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:17.216
I've just been shot! Help me.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.676
Fat Amy!

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.095
They shot Amy!

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.015
I've got you. I've got you.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:28.270
No, no, no. I'm talking,
I'm talking... I'm sitting up.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.189
- All right. Cool.
- There's no need for that.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.064
No mouth to mouth.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:35.694
Oh, shit. Bumper threw
a big-ass burrito at me.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:40.741
I'm gonna kill him, I swear. I'm
gonna finish him like a cheesecake.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.734
You've got yourself
a little something there.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.395
Just leave it.
It fuels my hate fire.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.520
Oh, my God.

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:23.969
It's a... It's...

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.141
What the hell?

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:33.645
It's pretty cool, actually. I think
we're just running out of gas.

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:35.939
No, that can't be.
You just filled the tank.

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:37.816
Yeah, I did.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:43.822
And, yet, maybe I didn't, because
I got hit by flying Mexican food.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.787
And we're out.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:52.956
A-ca-scuse me?

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:54.708
A-ca-believe it.

01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.169
Man, what are we gonna do?

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.337
Maybe we could call...

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:01.632
No, don't even say it,
Chloe. How dare you?

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:04.843
Oh, no, actually that is a really good idea.
I've got Bumper's number.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.262
Why do you have
Bumper's number?

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.650
So, Bellas,

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:24.363
what boring, estrogen-filled set have
you prepared for us this evening?

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.323
Excuse me?

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:29.451
But you guys are gonna get
pitch-slapped so hard

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:31.161
your man boobs are
gonna concave.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.249
Nine miles, guys.

01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:47.886
That's pretty good.

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:51.390
I set fires to feel joy.

01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:54.059
That's adorable.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:16.873
Five minutes, Bellas.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.834
Where did he come from?

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:22.587
It's over. There's no way we can
beat the Footnotes and the Trebles.

01:12:52.452 --> 01:12:54.202
That little peanut can sing.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:57.581
He really can. It sounds to me, though,
Gail, like his boys haven't dropped yet,

01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:58.874
if you know what I mean.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:02.502
If you mean his testicles, then I do, John.
I do. I really do.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:03.962
A-ca-huddle, now.

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:07.716
The top two teams go to the finals,
so we just have to beat one of them.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.471
And if we do it exactly how we rehearsed
it, we will get there, okay? Exactly.

01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:16.558
Hands in.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.352
On three or after three?

01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:21.146
Screw it. Let's just do it.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.815
Put your hands together
for the Barden Bellas!

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:27.027
Okay, the Bellas
are coming out.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.490
Another step in this
competition and...

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.743
One, two, three, four...

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.539
Here we go again.

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:41.541
Looks like they're
sticking with what they know.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:30.924
A little tension on
the stage tonight.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.384
Claws are out.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:36.138
This is just friendly
collegiate fun.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:39.099
It's a tough competition, but we're
all here to have a good time.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:42.519
That's right, John. But a mistake can
haunt you for the rest of your life

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:43.687
and affect your children.

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:53.196
What the hell, Beca? Were
you trying to screw us up?

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.531
Are you serious?

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:56.783
Newsflash. This
isn't the Beca show.

01:14:56.868 --> 01:14:59.327
Okay, I'm sorry
that I messed you up,

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:02.289
but in case you hadn't noticed, everybody
pretty much dozed off during our set.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:05.000
It's not your job to decide
what we do and when we do it.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:09.254
Why don't you ask the rest of the group how
they felt about your little improvisation?

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.383
Amy?

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:19.181
It was cool. But it did take
us a little bit by surprise.

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:21.057
Yeah, a lot by surprise.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:22.851
A little.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:26.021
- I told you she wasn't a Bella.
- Aubrey, don't.

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.356
No, that's okay.
You don't have to pretend

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:30.361
you're allowed to have a
say in the group, right?

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:33.028
Your attitude sucks. You're
a grade-A pain in my ass,

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.362
and I know you're
hooking up with Jesse.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:36.781
Aubrey, calm down.
We're not hooking up, I swear.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:40.702
Jesus Christ! That's perfect. Of
course you're here right now.

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:44.080
I don't need your help,
okay? Can you back off?

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.499
Trebles.
Time to bring the pain.

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:50.629
If this is what
I get for trying...

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.925
Beca? Beca, wait.

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:01.348
Aubrey, it actually
went really well.

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:02.724
Chloe, stop!

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:04.559
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.563
Beca? Beca, wait.

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:24.955
And the Treblemakers
seal the deal tonight.

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:28.625
Unfortunately, Barden's other
group, the Bellas, do not advance,

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:33.505
and senior Aubrey Posen loses her chance to
redeem herself from last year's Pukegate.

01:16:41.973 --> 01:16:43.723
Happy spring break.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.392
Thanks.

01:18:11.062 --> 01:18:14.898
In the simplest terms, in the
most convenient definitions.

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:19.027
But what we found out is that
each one of us is a brain.

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.695
And an athlete.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.655
And a basket case.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.907
A princess.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.617
And a criminal.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.036
Does that answer your question?

01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:31.581
Sincerely yours,
the Breakfast Club.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.637
Oh, my God.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.807
Okay.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:02.570
We are from the Collegiate
A Cappella Association.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:06.324
It has come to our attention
that you are not in college.

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.410
Is this your mother?

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:21.297
This is Aubrey Posen.

01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:27.178
Yes, thank you, sir.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.474
I look forward to seeing
you again at Lincoln Center.

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:34.978
Yes!

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:50.076
Aubrey?

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.756
I'm all in, bitches.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:21.524
Okay. The a-ca-gods have looked down on us
and they have given us a second chance.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:22.817
Shalom!

01:20:22.902 --> 01:20:23.985
I texted Beca.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:25.278
You did what?

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:26.404
She makes us better.

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:28.490
That's not an opinion
for you to have, Chloe.

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:30.158
Why? Because it's not yours?

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:31.826
You're not always
right, you know.

01:20:31.911 --> 01:20:33.661
We will win without her.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.425
- Jesse, I know you're in there.
- I can smell popcorn.

01:20:48.636 --> 01:20:50.595
Jesse, come on. Open up.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:02.732
Hey. I tried to call you. I
left you a bunch of messages.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:04.275
Yeah, I got them.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.653
I'm sorry that we fought.

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:09.322
I was mad and I overreacted
and I'm just...

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:10.615
Aubrey makes me crazy.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:11.908
Seriously?

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.286
You think I'm mad
because you yelled at me?

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:17.247
No, I know...

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:20.750
No, you don't. You think
you know, but you don't.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:26.005
You push away anyone who could
possibly care about you. Why is that?

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:28.925
I don't know.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.971
Well, you better figure it out
because I'm done with...

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.265
Whatever this is.

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:36.808
- Jesse...
- I'm done.

01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:55.493
Women.

01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:57.078
Yeah.

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:00.582
Okay, stop.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:02.333
What is happening to us?

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.420
Chloe, you sound like
you smoke three packs a day.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.964
Stacie, you are so
behind on choreography.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:11.759
And Jessica and Ashley, it is like
you haven't been here all year long.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:12.885
Aubrey, really?

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:14.571
We've literally been
here the whole time.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.348
Aubrey, please,
just give us a break.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.601
It's kind of not the same
without everyone here.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.019
We need Beca.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.062
Maybe if Aubrey loosened
the reins a little bit.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:24.355
Okay, shut it, Chloe!

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:28.192
Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:31.571
Chloe, could you please get your head
out of your ass? It's not a hat.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.576
A-ca-awkward.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:38.620
Again.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:46.711
No one was more surprised than me,
but I really liked those girls.

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:49.922
And you thought
quitting was the answer?

01:22:50.007 --> 01:22:52.050
Seriously? You can
say that to me?

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.427
Oh, come on, Bec,
that's so unfair.

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:58.306
Look, your mom and I,
we didn't work.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.476
But I tried so hard to make
things right between us.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:03.645
But you, you just shut me out.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:06.981
Yeah, well, I shut everybody
out. Don't take it personally.

01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:08.191
It's just easier.

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:10.735
It's also really lonely.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:18.409
What do I do?

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.745
Well, that's up to you.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.334
Trebles, listen up!

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:29.598
If this is about the Bellas getting
into the finals, we already know.

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.297
I don't give a crap
about those dumb bitches.

01:23:31.382 --> 01:23:34.342
Because I'm being brought up
to the musical big leagues.

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:35.507
What are you talking about?

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:39.263
John Mayer just asked me,
personally, through an assistant,

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:42.141
to sing backup on his new CD.

01:23:42.559 --> 01:23:46.729
I leave for Los Angeles in a few
hours, so I gotta get going.

01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:49.023
But Bumper, what about the ICCAs?
They're this weekend.

01:23:49.108 --> 01:23:54.487
Sorry, buddies, but I won that shit
like 100 times, so I'm out of here.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:57.365
Got a collarless leather jacket to buy.
Maybe some aviators.

01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:59.075
I might get an earring,
I don't know.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:02.370
It's Los Angeles. This is exciting stuff.
My life rules!

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:05.998
- Bumper's a jerk. All right, I said it.
- Yeah.

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:08.165
- Well, he's a jerk that we need to replace.
- Yeah.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:09.877
Pronto dente.

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:11.963
You know he writes
his own fan mail.

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.929
Spot opened up, and
it's yours if you want it.

01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:23.558
Just one condition. Promise
me you won't get all weird.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:27.019
We're just a group of guys singing
a bunch of covers of songs, okay?

01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:29.939
If you get weird, they will
definitely not let you stay.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:33.568
Deal. Although I don't know
what you mean by weird.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.279
Got it.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:39.691
I have been there for you for so many
years, and all you do is treat me like...

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.493
All right, no, okay,
just shut up! Everyone!

01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:46.372
Come on, I joined this group so I could hang
out with a bunch of really cool chicks.

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:48.583
And also 'cause I was really
sick of all my boyfriends

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:50.835
and I need to get
away from that.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.880
But this is some
serious horseshit.

01:24:54.882 --> 01:24:57.675
What's that smell?
Stinks everywhere.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.303
I don't wanna be
like the old Bellas.

01:25:00.387 --> 01:25:02.722
Yeah, I wanna be
how we are now.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:05.475
Me, too.

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:06.976
We should have
listened to Beca.

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.770
Oh, so it's my fault?

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:09.935
That's not what I'm saying.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:12.148
No, no, no, that's what
you're all thinking, isn't it?

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:16.152
That I'm the jerk. I am the
girl obsessed with winning.

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:19.614
Aubrey, you're too controlling
and it's gonna ruin all of us.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:22.825
You know what, I can lose
control if I want to.

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:26.954
I can let go. This time I'm
not gonna choke it down.

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:40.218
Come on, bring it!
You can do better than that!

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.594
That's all you got?

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:44.096
Enough! Enough!

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:49.477
We could have been champions!

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.648
Give me the pitch
pipe, you bitch!

01:25:54.233 --> 01:25:55.691
Give it to me!

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.779
Give it to me! Give it to me!

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:00.905
Never!

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.490
I'll protect you.
I'll protect you.

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:03.908
Hands off the goodies!

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:20.591
Move, you bitches!

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:28.808
Guys!

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.769
Guys, stop! What is going on?

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:43.155
Nothing. Nothing.
This is a Bellas rehearsal.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.575
I know. I just

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:49.120
wanted to say that I'm sorry.

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:53.374
What I did was
a really dick move

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.878
and I shouldn't have changed the
set without asking you guys.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.462
And I definitely
shouldn't have left.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:02.383
I let you guys down
and I'm really sorry.

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:06.387
And...

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:11.434
Aubrey, if you would
have me, I want back in.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:36.792
Aubrey.

01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:47.887
Wait.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:49.764
Thank you. That would
have been embarrassing.

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:54.477
Beca, I know that I've
been hard on you, okay?

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:59.106
I know that I have been
hard on everyone here.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:03.069
But I am my father's daughter.

01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:09.784
And he always said, "if at
first you don't succeed",

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.704
"pack your bags."

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.293
- Jesus.
- That's really crazy.

01:28:20.921 --> 01:28:23.965
I get it. Mine gets on me, too.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:25.883
Not like that, but...

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.087
I guess we don't really know
that much about each other.

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.848
About most of you, really.

01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:37.144
Well, I'll confess something
that none of you know about me.

01:28:38.772 --> 01:28:40.189
I have a lot of sex.

01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:41.565
Yeah, we know, Stacie.

01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:44.026
Only 'cause I just told you.

01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:45.236
This is a good idea.

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:48.447
That was a pretty bad example,
but this is a good idea.

01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:52.827
Why don't we all go
around the room,

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:57.748
and we can all say something about
ourselves that nobody else knows.

01:28:58.417 --> 01:29:00.543
Okay, I got something.

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:03.713
This is hard for me to
admit to you guys.

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:07.550
I think we all know where this
is going. Let's be honest.

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:13.806
Well, for the last two
years, I've had a serious

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:15.725
gambling problem.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.268
- What?
- What?

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:19.520
It started when I broke
up with my girlfriend.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:21.605
Whoomp! There it is.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:26.944
I still love you.

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:33.451
Anyone else?

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:38.414
I ate my twin in the womb.

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:41.417
What?

01:29:44.755 --> 01:29:45.796
Okay.

01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:48.883
Fat Amy?

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:51.093
I'm an open book.

01:29:51.178 --> 01:29:53.721
I mean, for God's sake,
you guys all call me Fat Amy.

01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:59.935
See, I guess I'm just not really
living if I'm not being 100% honest.

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:05.524
And my real name
is Fat Patricia.

01:30:06.777 --> 01:30:08.069
What?

01:30:09.446 --> 01:30:13.199
Okay. I've never been
one of those girls

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:17.828
who had a lot of friends
who were girls. And I do now.

01:30:19.456 --> 01:30:21.165
And that's pretty cool.

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:26.754
So, that's me.
Someone else please go.

01:30:29.007 --> 01:30:30.007
Okay.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:38.432
Over spring break, I made the
courageous decision to remove my nodes.

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:44.939
I know. The doctor said that
I can't sing above a G-sharp,

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:47.274
maybe ever.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:51.028
I thought the season was over.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.201
It's okay. It's okay.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:02.540
Beca, what do we do?

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:13.592
I'm sorry.

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:15.511
Maybe not here.

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:19.431
All right. Let's
remix this business.

01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:25.020
Aubrey, would you
pick a song for us, please?

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.606
Bruno Mars,
Just The Way You Are.

01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:32.444
Okay. Chloe, are you
okay to take the lead?

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:33.571
Yeah.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:19.343
Hands in.

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:25.432
One, two...

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:28.435
What was that?

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.187
I don't know, I've never
made that sound before.

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:33.107
Yo, but with your messed up vocal
cords, you could hit the bass notes.

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.192
Do you know what that means?

01:33:35.277 --> 01:33:36.485
Yes, Lilly?

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:38.696
I think I have something
that can help us out.

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:42.032
Excuse me, bitch, you
don't need to shout.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.159
Okay, don't get mouthy.

01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:00.968
Welcome to the finals

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:04.930
of the 2012 International Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella.

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:09.101
Lincoln Center is proud to welcome back
all of these young hopefuls tonight

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:12.813
who are hoping to win a trophy by
making music with their mouths.

01:34:20.613 --> 01:34:23.198
This is gonna be a big
night, and I tell you, Gail,

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:26.160
- if you can just shut your eyes.
- I'm doing it.

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:29.371
Shut your eyes and get rid
of all the a-ca-politics,

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:33.834
then you can remember that being at
Lincoln Center, in the Big Apple,

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:38.589
and singing on this storied stage is
the dream of every a cappella singer.

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:40.382
You said it, John.

01:34:56.107 --> 01:35:00.402
The University of Virginia
Hullabahoos, ladies and gentlemen.

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:02.404
There they are.

01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:04.281
One, two, three, swag!

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:08.786
Welcome back to the International
Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.

01:35:09.412 --> 01:35:14.124
This next group, they need no
introduction, but I'll do it anyway!

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:17.878
Hey.

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:19.004
Good luck.

01:35:19.756 --> 01:35:21.882
Thanks. You, too.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:24.718
The Barden University
Treblemakers!

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:11.051
Oh, the Trebles closing
it strong like always.

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:14.930
Absolutely tight. It's gonna be
very hard to beat that tonight.

01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:17.891
Every other group has their
work cut out for them, John.

01:38:17.976 --> 01:38:22.062
I'm glad it's not us anymore, Gail.
Those days are over, thank goodness.

01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:25.232
Especially since they
wouldn't have us back.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:28.735
All right. How about that?

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.945
The Barden University
Treblemakers.

01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:31.113
I love you, awesome nerds.

01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:33.657
Yeah, you guys are the best.

01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:38.996
Even though some of you are pretty thin,
I think that you all have fat hearts,

01:38:39.998 --> 01:38:42.124
and that's what matters.

01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:44.501
Okay, let's just
smash this. Okay?

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:49.506
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Barden Bellas!

01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:54.511
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Will you look at this?

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:58.557
Gone are those Bella uniforms and
this is a whole new look for them,

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.309
and it is hot, hot, hot.

01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:02.894
John, these
girls could turn me.

01:39:07.692 --> 01:39:10.027
We love you, Bellas!

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.704
One, two, three, four.

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:04.511
Way to go, Beca!

01:43:22.113 --> 01:43:23.363
What a show!

01:43:23.447 --> 01:43:27.576
I think we have just seen some a
cappella history being made, John.

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:31.538
And from an all-female group, Gail.
I could never have called this one.

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:34.249
Never. Well, you are
a misogynist at heart,

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:36.376
so there's no way you would
have bet on these girls to win.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.460
Absolutely.

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:43.133
Weren't they incredible?

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:50.140
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give
it up again for the Barden Bellas!

01:43:52.435 --> 01:43:54.895
Told you. Endings
are the best part.

01:43:54.979 --> 01:43:56.146
You're such a weirdo.

01:44:09.827 --> 01:44:11.620
Listen up, a-ca-ballers.

01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:16.207
I have been rejected by the Army, shoved
into a Dora the Explorer backpack,

01:44:16.292 --> 01:44:19.753
and pushed into the girls' locker
room wearing nothing but suspenders.

01:44:19.837 --> 01:44:22.756
But no matter.
I am in the world that I love.

01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:25.142
And with the assistance
of my boy, Justin...

01:44:25.217 --> 01:44:26.259
My liege.

01:44:26.344 --> 01:44:27.584
I launch this year's auditions.

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.847
Belly roll.

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:36.728
The most recent IcCA national champion
winners get to pick the audition song.

01:44:43.361 --> 01:44:46.112
All right, nerds.
Let's go with...

01:46:19.957 --> 01:46:21.541
Because I have nodes.

01:46:21.625 --> 01:46:25.962
Chloe, don't worry, it's just God
punishing you 'cause you're a ginger.
