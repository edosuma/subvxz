- I do.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.284
- He deserved it.
- He deserved a slap.

08:09.352 --> 08:11.953
You knocked him
across the room.

08:12.021 --> 08:13.889
[Sighs]

08:13.956 --> 08:18.560
What happened with Zoe?

08:18.628 --> 08:20.529
She's leaving New York

08:20.596 --> 08:24.533
to take care of her niece
whose father is dying.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.368
Oh, my God.

08:26.436 --> 08:29.271
Harvey, I'm sorry.

08:29.338 --> 08:31.673
Is there anything--

08:31.741 --> 08:34.443
No.

08:35.544 --> 08:38.380
Just one thing.

08:38.448 --> 08:41.450
I don't think kicking
the dog is gonna help.

08:51.694 --> 08:56.131
Wow, you look like hell.

08:56.199 --> 08:57.499
Jimmy.

08:57.567 --> 08:59.134
You here to pick a fight
with me?

08:59.202 --> 09:00.402
'Cause I'm really
not in the mood.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.871
No, no, Mike.
It's not like that, man.

09:02.939 --> 09:04.306
Oh, yeah?
You're not still pissed at me?

09:04.373 --> 09:06.074
You gave me an out.

09:06.142 --> 09:07.609
I might not have respected it
at the time,

09:07.677 --> 09:08.710
but I do now.

09:08.778 --> 09:09.738
As far as I'm concerned,

09:09.779 --> 09:10.712
I owe you one.
Okay.

09:10.780 --> 09:11.901
Yeah.
Let me buy you a drink.

09:11.948 --> 09:12.981
Two conditions.

09:13.049 --> 09:14.149
One:
You still owe me one.

09:14.217 --> 09:17.252
Two:
You still owe me one.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.154
As long as I still
don't owe you one.

09:19.222 --> 09:21.623
Bartender.
It's good to see you, man.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.492
You too, buddy.
So what's going on?

09:23.559 --> 09:26.161
You had a bad day?
Yeah.

09:26.229 --> 09:27.529
Okay.
So give it to me.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.197
Well, evidently,
getting in at 8:30

09:29.265 --> 09:30.599
can only mean one thing.

09:30.666 --> 09:31.833
Yeah, that you had
your head up your ass

09:31.901 --> 09:34.436
from 7:00 to 8:15.
- How'd you know?

09:34.504 --> 09:36.238
Are you forgetting
I used to work for Louis too?

09:36.305 --> 09:38.940
And unlike you, I didn't have
Harvey there to protect me.

09:39.008 --> 09:40.442
No, this was Harvey.

09:40.510 --> 09:43.044
Whoa.
Ain't that some shit.

09:43.112 --> 09:44.312
Anyway,

09:44.380 --> 09:45.313
here's
to the wonderful world

09:45.381 --> 09:47.415
of being an associate,
right?

09:47.483 --> 09:48.683
[Glasses clink]
Yeah.

09:48.751 --> 09:50.252
Pearson Hardman.

09:50.319 --> 09:53.622
What does that mean?

09:53.689 --> 09:55.690
I'm at Bratton Gould,
my man.

09:55.758 --> 09:57.926
And I'm happy.
No!

09:57.994 --> 09:59.394
Associates don't get
to be happy, Jimmy.

09:59.462 --> 10:01.396
No, you do
at Bratton Gould.

10:01.464 --> 10:05.166
I got an office.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.469
- Shoot me now.
- [Laughs]

10:07.537 --> 10:09.004
That's great.

10:09.071 --> 10:10.238
Listen, Mike.

10:10.306 --> 10:12.240
When I said
that I owe you one, I mean it.

10:12.308 --> 10:14.809
'Cause you didn't hear it
from me, but we're expanding.

10:14.877 --> 10:15.810
So if you want to jump,
just let me know.

10:15.878 --> 10:17.112
I'll put in a word
for you.

10:17.179 --> 10:19.047
- I can't leave Harvey.
- Screw Harvey.

10:19.115 --> 10:23.351
I mean,
what's he done for you?

10:23.419 --> 10:24.686
More than you know.

10:24.754 --> 10:27.255
Okay, maybe.

10:27.323 --> 10:29.190
But a year
under Harvey Specter,

10:29.258 --> 10:30.959
they would kill
to have you.

10:31.027 --> 10:34.462
And you wouldn't be
the only one.

10:35.965 --> 10:37.766
There are people
from Pearson Hardman

10:37.833 --> 10:39.134
going to Bratton Gould?
Who?

10:39.201 --> 10:40.602
I can't tell you that.

10:40.670 --> 10:41.770
Jimmy,
you have to tell me that.

10:41.837 --> 10:42.871
Mike, come on.

10:42.939 --> 10:43.939
If they knew
it came from me--

10:44.006 --> 10:46.174
They won't.

10:48.811 --> 10:53.648
I saw Clark and Owens meeting
with our partners.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.217
If you're here
to give me

10:56.285 --> 10:57.325
your letter
of resignation,

10:57.353 --> 10:58.653
I'll accept it
in the morning.

10:58.721 --> 11:00.889
Oh, that's ironic.
I was offered a job tonight.

11:00.957 --> 11:02.857
- Congratulations.
- I passed.

11:02.925 --> 11:04.025
You want credit
for that?

11:04.093 --> 11:05.994
No, I want to do the job
I already have.

11:06.062 --> 11:08.363
Apology accepted.

11:08.431 --> 11:10.765
Bratton Gould
is poaching our associates,

11:10.833 --> 11:12.300
Clark, Owens,

11:12.368 --> 11:13.301
but he's also coming after--

11:13.369 --> 11:15.637
Our clients.
Trent Devon.

11:15.705 --> 11:16.805
Someone's whispering
in his ear.

11:16.872 --> 11:18.139
Allison Holt.

11:18.207 --> 11:19.774
She was brought in
about a month ago.

11:19.842 --> 11:21.476
She was ready to throw you
under the bus.

11:21.544 --> 11:22.877
And Jessica
threw her out.

11:22.945 --> 11:24.079
So you think
she's in this for revenge?

11:24.146 --> 11:25.180
Maybe.

11:25.247 --> 11:26.648
But we both know
who brought her in.

11:26.716 --> 11:28.850
Hardman.

11:28.918 --> 11:32.020
You think
this is him?

11:32.088 --> 11:33.188
Hell of a view.

11:33.255 --> 11:35.357
Clark and Owens
don't deserve this.

11:35.424 --> 11:39.027
Which one is Owens,
by the way, the redhead?

11:39.095 --> 11:40.996
You don't even know
who your associates are,

11:41.063 --> 11:43.131
but you're here to complain
about losing them?

11:43.199 --> 11:45.000
You bitter
because you were fired?

11:45.067 --> 11:46.267
I'm not bitter, Harvey.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.837
Unlike you, I don't take
things personally.

11:48.904 --> 11:50.438
And by the way,
I was right.

11:50.506 --> 11:52.540
I advised you to settle,
and you settled.

11:52.608 --> 11:54.476
Your advice was for us
to settle,

11:54.543 --> 11:56.111
and I lose
my law license.

11:56.178 --> 11:57.479
And my question is,

11:57.546 --> 12:00.482
was taking that deal
your idea or Daniel Hardman's?

12:00.549 --> 12:02.684
You think
Daniel's behind this?

12:02.752 --> 12:04.452
You met with him
six days ago.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.821
I'm not even gonna ask
how you know that.

12:06.889 --> 12:08.289
I told you before,
Jessica.

12:08.357 --> 12:09.658
I'm a straight shooter.

12:09.725 --> 12:11.693
Daniel wasn't dictating
my actions then,

12:11.761 --> 12:13.294
and he's not now.

12:13.362 --> 12:15.096
Either way,
we are filing a claim

12:15.164 --> 12:16.364
for tortious interference.

12:16.432 --> 12:17.793
You're using
privileged information

12:17.800 --> 12:18.933
to target our clients.

12:19.001 --> 12:21.403
You really want to cry
foul to the ref?

12:21.470 --> 12:23.638
You know who went to the ref
more than anyone?

12:23.706 --> 12:26.141
Michael Jordan.
He did it quietly.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.844
And he got six rings,
and he's my client.

12:29.912 --> 12:32.080
Maybe I
should call him too.

12:32.148 --> 12:33.748
You're not getting
Trent Devon.

12:33.816 --> 12:36.518
You can't keep people
who want to leave, Harvey.

12:36.585 --> 12:39.020
Everybody knows
about your civil war.

12:39.088 --> 12:41.156
Pearson Hardman
is falling apart.

12:41.223 --> 12:42.891
And I'm telling you,

12:42.958 --> 12:47.796
the avalanche
has already started.

12:53.636 --> 12:54.969
The Carillo contracts,
they should be signed

12:55.037 --> 12:56.471
and on my desk.
I know.

12:56.539 --> 12:57.806
Well,
since you're so in the know,

12:57.840 --> 12:59.040
perhaps you can tell me
why I don't have them yet.

12:59.108 --> 13:01.676
- Because they're not signed.
- Not signed?

13:01.744 --> 13:03.078
I called earlier to have them
to have them messengered--

13:03.145 --> 13:04.379
The story's already
taking too long.

13:04.447 --> 13:05.413
And they said
they didn't need to see them.

13:05.481 --> 13:06.815
Still waiting.

13:06.882 --> 13:08.583
They said
they're no longer a client.

13:08.651 --> 13:10.585
Harold.

13:10.653 --> 13:12.087
No.
Harold didn't--

13:12.154 --> 13:14.189
Louis,
Harold didn't do anything.

13:14.256 --> 13:15.590
Harold never
does anything.

13:15.658 --> 13:17.192
He got me the contracts
first thing this morning.

13:17.259 --> 13:18.393
He worked all night.
They were really quite--

13:18.461 --> 13:19.794
[grunts] Excuse me.
They were really quite--

13:19.862 --> 13:22.063
- "Quite" what?
- Good, actually.

13:22.131 --> 13:23.598
Uhhuh. And how many
citations you correct?

13:23.666 --> 13:24.866
- None.
- You're lying.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.835
- No, I'm not.
- I don't care.

13:26.902 --> 13:28.903
Wow. Yeah.
That is a tattoo.

13:28.971 --> 13:30.572
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

13:30.639 --> 13:34.075
Manatee--the slow,
gentle cow of the sea.

13:34.143 --> 13:36.511
Uh, no.
It's a shark actually.

13:36.579 --> 13:38.446
Totally.
No--yes.

13:38.514 --> 13:39.547
That's a shark.

13:39.615 --> 13:42.617
That is a big, wide,
fat shark.

13:42.685 --> 13:44.219
You're fired.

13:44.286 --> 13:46.721
- You can't fire Mike.
- <i>You.</i>

13:46.789 --> 13:49.124
You moron. You can't
even get your firing right.

13:49.191 --> 13:52.293
- I'm fired?
- Louis, come on.

13:52.361 --> 13:53.628
Pack up your things and go.
Now.

13:53.696 --> 13:54.896
But I did everything
you asked.

13:54.897 --> 13:56.231
I delivered
the Carillo contracts.

13:56.298 --> 13:57.432
I don't care.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.101
The client fired us,
and now I'm firing you.

14:00.169 --> 14:01.669
Times are tough,
people.

14:01.737 --> 14:04.806
We can't afford mistakes.
We can't afford incompetence.

14:04.874 --> 14:07.075
You can't cut it,
get out.

14:07.143 --> 14:08.476
There is no place
for mediocrity here

14:08.544 --> 14:09.878
at Pearson Hardman,

14:09.945 --> 14:13.882
and there's certainly no place
for someone like you.

14:13.949 --> 14:17.519
Everyone else
get back to work.

14:26.925 --> 14:27.925
You know,
I didn't just do

14:27.960 --> 14:29.227
what he asked for Carillo.

14:29.294 --> 14:30.328
I went way beyond.

14:30.396 --> 14:31.729
I didn't make
any mistakes,

14:31.797 --> 14:33.231
and I know that they're not
leaving because of me.

14:33.298 --> 14:34.999
So why didn't you
say that to him?

14:35.067 --> 14:37.902
Because he
makes me freeze.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.003
[Sighs]

14:39.071 --> 14:40.238
You know,
sometimes I wish

14:40.305 --> 14:42.807
we would've known each other
at Harvard.

14:42.875 --> 14:46.511
Yeah. Yeah.
Harvard.

14:46.578 --> 14:48.379
You probably hung out
with Duncan and those guys.

14:48.447 --> 14:50.748
I hung out
with the library.

14:50.816 --> 14:52.383
I'm such a loser.

14:52.451 --> 14:53.951
No, you're not,
Harold.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.520
Look, for the record,

14:55.587 --> 14:58.122
Duncan was a douche.
He <i>was</i> a douche.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.991
- Totally.
- Like a douchy-douche.

15:00.059 --> 15:01.292
Do you remember that thing
he used to do with the--

15:01.360 --> 15:02.640
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

15:02.695 --> 15:05.396
[Laughter]

15:05.464 --> 15:06.964
See,
that's what I mean.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.066
If you would've known me
there,

15:08.133 --> 15:09.300
then at least
someone here would know

15:09.368 --> 15:10.468
that I wasn't always
like this.

15:10.536 --> 15:12.036
People used to come
to me

15:12.104 --> 15:13.838
for help
on their essays.

15:13.906 --> 15:15.606
We'd sit in the quiet
of my apartment

15:15.674 --> 15:17.141
where no one
was yelling at me,

15:17.209 --> 15:19.577
and I could think
and write.

15:19.645 --> 15:23.481
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:23.549 --> 15:26.050
Here.

15:26.118 --> 15:28.386
This is the first essay
I wrote in law school.

15:28.454 --> 15:30.655
Look
at the Professor's comments.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.757
Holy shit.

15:32.825 --> 15:36.394
Louis is right.
I don't belong here.

15:36.462 --> 15:38.162
No, he's not.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.597
- Thomas.
- Poconos weekend.

15:39.665 --> 15:41.165
- With the girlfriend.
- Which one?

15:41.233 --> 15:43.601
- Doesn't matter.
- Done. Winters?

15:43.669 --> 15:45.069
- Lunch with the mayor.
- Campos.

15:45.137 --> 15:47.071
- Lunch with me.
- Lunch with me.

15:47.139 --> 15:49.207
- Benson?
- Box at the Garden.

15:49.274 --> 15:50.575
Have Lundqvist meet him
pre-game.

15:50.642 --> 15:51.576
Does the king do that?

15:51.643 --> 15:53.177
He does for me.
Siebertz.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.712
- Tickets.
- Super Bowl.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.280
- Broadway.
- Really?

15:56.348 --> 15:57.482
Beneath
that lumberjack chest

15:57.549 --> 15:58.583
beats the heart
of a songbird.

15:58.650 --> 16:00.618
Fine.
Anything but <i>Cats.</i>

16:00.686 --> 16:01.619
<i>Cats</i> closed
over a decade ago.

16:01.687 --> 16:03.020
What took 'em
so long?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.456
That's it then.
We're done.

16:05.524 --> 16:06.758
Closed them all.

16:06.825 --> 16:09.360
That's just foreplay.
We didn't close shit.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.229
I want to have talked
to every one of my clients

16:11.296 --> 16:12.463
by the end
of the day.

16:12.531 --> 16:14.866
You stay on Trent Devon
until he takes the call.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.000
I will.

16:16.068 --> 16:18.035
And, Harvey...

16:18.103 --> 16:21.773
No one
is leaving you.

16:25.444 --> 16:26.711
[Knock on door]
Okay.

16:26.779 --> 16:28.679
Harold is
totally freaked out.

16:28.747 --> 16:30.114
I think he's gonna have
an ulcer,

16:30.182 --> 16:31.983
but the good news is he'll never
disappoint you again,

16:32.050 --> 16:36.187
so you can go and magnanimously
hire him back now.

16:36.255 --> 16:37.522
Why would I do that?

16:37.589 --> 16:40.024
Um, I don't know,
because you made your point.

16:40.092 --> 16:41.959
You think
that was a show?

16:42.027 --> 16:44.862
Look,
I know Harold can be...

16:44.930 --> 16:46.397
Harold.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.199
He's an idiot savant
minus the savant.

16:48.267 --> 16:50.334
He tries hard.
He's a good person.

16:50.402 --> 16:52.203
Yeah, well, then tell him
to join the Peace Corps.

16:52.271 --> 16:54.272
Why don't you just give him
a second chance?

16:54.339 --> 16:56.841
I did, Mike.
It was called his second day.

16:56.909 --> 16:58.230
You realize you need cause,
right?

16:58.243 --> 16:59.477
You want a cause?

16:59.545 --> 17:01.112
He left a zero off
the Hopkins settlement,

17:01.180 --> 17:03.648
which cost the client
$360,000.

17:03.715 --> 17:05.683
He filed a motion
with the appeals court

17:05.751 --> 17:08.185
instead of the superior court,
which accidentally triggered

17:08.252 --> 17:09.387
a death penalty review.

17:09.454 --> 17:11.021
And then
the one and only time

17:11.089 --> 17:13.891
that I take him to court
with me, his fly was down,

17:13.959 --> 17:16.260
and he called the judge
"Your Owner."

17:16.328 --> 17:19.030
[Laughs]

17:19.097 --> 17:21.799
You know why he does
those things, right?

17:21.867 --> 17:23.800
Because you
intimidate him.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.670
You brutalize him.

17:25.737 --> 17:26.737
You're always talking
about how great

17:26.805 --> 17:27.905
you are at grooming us.

17:27.973 --> 17:29.574
Well, you were not great
at grooming him.

17:29.608 --> 17:31.242
If he can't take
a drill sergeant yelling at him,

17:31.310 --> 17:32.777
how can he handle
people shooting at him?

17:32.845 --> 17:34.085
People don't shoot at us,
Louis.

17:34.112 --> 17:36.948
Don't they?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.216
Okay.
You know what?

17:38.283 --> 17:42.253
You want him to stay...

17:42.321 --> 17:45.756
Fine.
He can stay.

17:45.824 --> 17:46.791
Thank you.

17:46.859 --> 17:47.959
One condition.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.493
You personally guarantee

17:49.561 --> 17:51.028
every piece
of work product

17:51.096 --> 17:52.697
that Harold sends
out of this office

17:52.764 --> 17:53.931
just like I have.

17:53.999 --> 17:55.166
You check everything
he does.

17:55.234 --> 17:56.701
You cross every "t,"
dot every "I,"

17:56.768 --> 17:59.537
and still do everything
you have to for Harvey.

17:59.605 --> 18:02.540
People may not be shooting
at us, but we are at war.

18:02.608 --> 18:05.109
So how does that work
for you?

18:05.177 --> 18:09.413
Do we have a deal?

18:15.487 --> 18:19.156
Harold.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.325
I was just coming by
to wish you well.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.394
Thanks, Rachel,
but I think it's gonna be okay.

18:23.462 --> 18:25.296
Mike's talking to Louis
right now.

18:25.364 --> 18:26.430
Really?

18:26.498 --> 18:28.933
That's great.

18:33.605 --> 18:36.440
Well?

18:42.381 --> 18:45.316
There was nothing
I could do.

18:45.384 --> 18:48.686
It's okay.
I know you tried, Mike.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.788
If it'll make
you feel better,

18:50.856 --> 18:53.457
you're not the only person
being let go this week.

18:53.525 --> 18:56.594
Well, Clark and Owens
are only getting let go

18:56.662 --> 18:57.828
because someone found out
that they're moving

18:57.896 --> 18:59.797
to Bratton Gould
with McKinney and Kline.

18:59.865 --> 19:01.832
- They are?
- Yeah, I overheard it.

19:01.900 --> 19:05.036
I guess some people
will choose any port in a storm.

19:05.103 --> 19:09.674
Harold,
good luck.

19:09.741 --> 19:13.244
You too.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.821
[Sighs]

19:23.889 --> 19:25.690
This sucks.
It does.

19:25.757 --> 19:29.360
He didn't deserve that.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.066
Allison's not done.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.801
We know.
We're working all the clients.

19:36.868 --> 19:39.303
No, it's more than that.
She's taking McKinney and Kline.

19:39.371 --> 19:40.338
It's just
two more associates.

19:40.405 --> 19:44.675
No,
it's more than that.

19:44.743 --> 19:46.410
I tell you
the rats are jumping ship,

19:46.478 --> 19:47.611
and you say it's fine,
but Donna nods,

19:47.679 --> 19:49.079
and you're busting out
life jackets?

19:49.114 --> 19:50.681
You have a history
of panicking.

19:50.749 --> 19:51.782
He's not panicking.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.484
Clark, Owens,
McKinney, Kline--

19:53.552 --> 19:54.785
these aren't
just fifth-years.

19:54.853 --> 19:56.153
They're
the best fifth-years.

19:56.221 --> 19:57.861
They're Louis's
first class of associates.

19:57.923 --> 19:59.690
He gave her
a report card?

19:59.758 --> 20:01.926
Harvey,
you do not know that.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.894
Well,
I'm gonna goddamn find out.

20:03.962 --> 20:06.964
[Laughs]
Stop.

20:07.032 --> 20:08.566
Just cut it out.

20:08.633 --> 20:09.834
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

20:09.901 --> 20:11.335
Bye.

20:11.403 --> 20:12.903
I never liked you,
Louis.

20:12.971 --> 20:14.839
You're a vindictive,
sniveling rat,

20:14.906 --> 20:16.907
but I never thought
you'd betray your own firm.

20:16.975 --> 20:19.210
I never betrayed
this firm.

20:19.277 --> 20:20.717
What do you call helping
Allison Holt

20:20.746 --> 20:21.746
poach our associates?

20:21.813 --> 20:23.881
I had nothing to do
with that.

20:23.949 --> 20:25.549
I love this firm,
Harvey.

20:25.617 --> 20:27.084
You were a traitor
when you voted for Hardman,

20:27.152 --> 20:28.285
and you're
a traitor now.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.587
Like I've told you before,

20:29.654 --> 20:30.688
I'm not the only one

20:30.756 --> 20:31.756
in this firm
who voted for Hardman.

20:31.823 --> 20:33.090
And I voted to oust him
once I knew.

20:33.158 --> 20:35.059
Once you knew you had
to save your own ass.

20:35.127 --> 20:36.327
All right, you know what,
Harvey, just get out.

20:36.395 --> 20:40.164
Get out.

20:40.232 --> 20:43.801
Ri--
I did nothing wrong.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.436
Jesus!

20:45.504 --> 20:47.071
You bugged my office.

20:47.139 --> 20:49.407
You ran to Hardman
about the CM lawsuit.

20:49.474 --> 20:51.776
You sold your soul
for senior partnership.

20:51.843 --> 20:54.278
And once you got it,
you created a drug policy

20:54.346 --> 20:57.248
with the sole purpose
of firing me!

20:57.315 --> 20:58.282
I did it
for Hardman.

20:58.350 --> 20:59.617
Maybe Hardman
wanted me dead,

20:59.684 --> 21:01.185
but you're the one
who went out,

21:01.253 --> 21:02.820
got the gun,
aimed it,

21:02.888 --> 21:04.889
and fired it at my head.

21:04.956 --> 21:06.157
And it blew up
in my face!

21:06.224 --> 21:09.493
And what would have happened
if it didn't?

21:09.561 --> 21:11.362
I was under orders.

21:11.430 --> 21:12.950
Were you also under orders
when you ran

21:12.998 --> 21:14.498
to Hardman
about Monica Eton?

21:14.566 --> 21:17.101
How do you know
it was me?

21:17.169 --> 21:19.170
Because I set it up!

21:19.237 --> 21:22.406
Because I know
who you are!

21:22.474 --> 21:25.142
Are you still
gonna tell me

21:25.210 --> 21:26.644
you're not helping Allison?

21:26.711 --> 21:28.813
Harvey,
I swear to God

21:28.880 --> 21:31.449
I did not do this.

21:31.516 --> 21:32.716
Maybe not.

21:32.784 --> 21:34.552
But now that you've done
what you've done,

21:34.619 --> 21:38.556
I will never trust you.

21:40.292 --> 21:42.927
Pearson Hardman
is my life.

21:42.994 --> 21:45.996
Well, here's what's
gonna happen from now on.

21:46.064 --> 21:49.266
You and I,
we're done.

21:49.334 --> 21:51.769
Don't drop by
my office.

21:51.837 --> 21:54.438
Don't ask Donna
for information.

21:54.506 --> 21:55.873
You're the guy
that nobody wants

21:55.941 --> 21:59.743
but we can't get rid of.

21:59.811 --> 22:02.480
I'm a senior partner.

22:02.547 --> 22:04.615
So I can't
make you leave.

22:04.683 --> 22:07.051
But as far
as I'm concerned,

22:07.119 --> 22:10.855
you don't even work here
anymore.

22:10.922 --> 22:13.591
[Clatters]

22:30.299 --> 22:34.502
That glass
does not look halffull.

22:38.274 --> 22:41.543
You're cherry-picking
Pearson Hardman associates.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.911
I only want
the best cherries.

22:42.978 --> 22:46.447
Then why not go
after the gardener who grew 'em?

22:46.515 --> 22:48.750
You want to leave
Pearson Hardman.

22:48.817 --> 22:51.753
I'm a proven commodity who
delivers outstanding billables.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.288
With an unparalleled knowledge
of finance.

22:53.355 --> 22:55.223
Yeah, I'm well aware
of who you are, Louis.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.859
But how do I know
that Harvey Specter

22:57.927 --> 22:59.427
didn't just send you here?

22:59.495 --> 23:01.629
'Cause I'm the last person
that Harvey Specter would trust.

23:01.697 --> 23:02.664
Just ask Daniel Hardman.

23:02.731 --> 23:05.266
I did.
He said you betrayed him.

23:05.334 --> 23:07.502
Like I said,
I am well aware of who you are.

23:07.570 --> 23:09.137
Well, if you spoke to Daniel,
then you would know

23:09.204 --> 23:11.639
that he lost Pearson Hardman
not because of my betrayal

23:11.707 --> 23:12.807
but because of his own.

23:12.875 --> 23:16.911
My loyalty does not sway
with the wind.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.513
I'm leaving
Pearson Hardman

23:18.581 --> 23:20.081
because there's no room
for me there anymore.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.649
You could go anywhere.

23:21.717 --> 23:23.251
Well, I've done
my homework.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.955
You guys are expanding.
You are hiring well.

23:27.022 --> 23:29.457
You're gonna have
a young staff

23:29.525 --> 23:30.725
that needs guidance.

23:30.793 --> 23:32.493
You know
that I'm the right fit.

23:32.561 --> 23:33.928
And I want
to move now.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.697
You have
a non-compete clause.

23:35.764 --> 23:37.244
Jessica is gonna waive
the non-compete

23:37.266 --> 23:38.666
as long
as I don't take clients.

23:38.734 --> 23:41.736
- I wouldn't if I were her.
- Well, you're not.

23:41.804 --> 23:43.004
Harvey wants me gone,

23:43.072 --> 23:46.808
and he has a way
of getting what he wants, so--

23:49.144 --> 23:50.845
There might be
a partnership position

23:50.913 --> 23:53.314
for you.

23:53.382 --> 23:55.149
Senior partnership.

23:55.217 --> 23:57.652
That, you're gonna have
to earn.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.987
I have earned it.

23:59.054 --> 24:00.388
And I'm not giving up
what I've worked for

24:00.456 --> 24:01.589
my whole life.

24:01.657 --> 24:04.592
Louis, you have made
a tactical error.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.094
You've shown me
all your cards,

24:06.161 --> 24:07.695
you can't offer
any clients,

24:07.763 --> 24:09.097
and you're being forced
to leave a place

24:09.164 --> 24:10.298
that doesn't want you.

24:10.366 --> 24:13.368
You are a very good fit
for us.

24:13.435 --> 24:16.037
But if you want
to join us,

24:16.105 --> 24:18.773
you're gonna have to prove
how much you want it.

24:18.841 --> 24:20.008
Please don't do this.

24:20.075 --> 24:22.510
Do what?
I'm just negotiating.

24:22.578 --> 24:26.147
You have
an empty title.

24:26.215 --> 24:30.051
If you come with us,
I promise

24:30.119 --> 24:33.388
that you will be
truly valued.

24:42.031 --> 24:43.598
Well, that's it.

24:43.666 --> 24:45.566
I've talked to every client
except Trent Devon.

24:45.634 --> 24:46.701
Well, I know
why he's returning

24:46.769 --> 24:48.049
Allison's calls
instead of yours.

24:48.103 --> 24:49.270
Because he thinks
we're not focused.

24:49.338 --> 24:50.371
That's not enough.

24:50.439 --> 24:52.807
Come on. You taught me
to always ask...

24:52.875 --> 24:54.008
What's in it for him?

24:54.076 --> 24:55.556
"If we're looking
to expand our reach,

24:55.577 --> 24:57.011
"then Trent Devon's
data platform

24:57.079 --> 24:59.847
provides the perfect symbiosis
with our search algorithms."

24:59.915 --> 25:03.551
Page 23,
the CEO of flash-start.

25:03.619 --> 25:05.553
Allison doesn't
represent them.

25:05.621 --> 25:08.189
Google bought Meebo
for $100 million.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.524
Allison is trying to do
the same thing

25:09.591 --> 25:10.591
with Flash-Start.

25:10.659 --> 25:12.360
Allison doesn't
represent them.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.796
Pretend she does.

25:14.863 --> 25:16.998
Trent gets $100 million,

25:17.066 --> 25:18.566
but his company
gets swallowed up,

25:18.634 --> 25:19.767
and that's not
what he wants.

25:19.835 --> 25:20.802
Well, what if they let him run
both companies?

25:20.869 --> 25:21.909
That's too good
to be true.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.071
It's happened before.

25:23.138 --> 25:25.039
So if that's true,
all we need to do

25:25.107 --> 25:26.607
is figure out a way
to beat that deal.

25:26.675 --> 25:29.977
We can't beat that deal.

25:30.045 --> 25:33.214
Okay.
So what do we do?

25:39.822 --> 25:40.955
Why didn't you
just tell me?

25:41.023 --> 25:42.557
Allison said
you had a history

25:42.624 --> 25:45.059
and that it might get in the way
of what she was offering.

25:45.127 --> 25:47.195
- Flash-Start.
- Very good.

25:47.262 --> 25:48.496
But Allison
doesn't represent them.

25:48.564 --> 25:50.798
No, but she does represent
a hedge fund

25:50.866 --> 25:53.101
that's about to buy
a controlling interest.

25:53.168 --> 25:54.268
And let me guess.

25:54.336 --> 25:55.903
They want you
to run the whole thing.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.939
We'll take on Google.

25:58.006 --> 25:59.774
And let me guess.

25:59.842 --> 26:01.209
You're here to try
and beat it.

26:01.276 --> 26:03.711
No, I'm here to tell you
to take it.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.079
If I were you,
I would,

26:05.147 --> 26:07.882
and I would hire the lawyer
who brought it to me.

26:07.950 --> 26:08.883
Thanks, Harvey.

26:08.951 --> 26:09.984
You're welcome.

26:10.052 --> 26:13.755
There's just one thing.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.190
I wonder,
what's in it for her?

26:16.258 --> 26:17.391
What are you implying?

26:17.459 --> 26:19.193
Let me look over the deal.
My own time.

26:19.261 --> 26:21.562
If it is what she says it is,
I'll tell you.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.598
If it's not,
you'll want to know.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.266
- Harvey, I already told you--
- Look.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.701
You said
we weren't focused,

26:26.769 --> 26:28.503
and I'm not here to try
to convince you that we were.

26:28.570 --> 26:30.772
But you also said
you've always trusted me,

26:30.839 --> 26:36.611
and I'm telling you,
trust me one more time.

26:38.814 --> 26:39.981
[Knock at door]

26:40.048 --> 26:42.617
Louis.
Do you need something?

26:42.684 --> 26:47.922
Actually, yes.

26:47.990 --> 26:49.791
I need you to waive
my non-compete,

26:49.858 --> 26:53.628
so I can take a position
at another firm.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.730
Bratton Gould.

26:55.798 --> 26:58.399
I had nothing to do
with Allison Holt's poaching.

26:58.467 --> 27:01.402
What did
she offer you?

27:02.971 --> 27:04.572
I went to her.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.274
Why?

27:06.341 --> 27:09.977
I got Harvey's message.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.880
What message?

27:12.948 --> 27:15.817
You don't know?
It doesn't matter.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.451
This is what he wants.

27:17.519 --> 27:22.690
And this is
what you want?

27:22.758 --> 27:24.258
You know
you can't take clients.

27:24.326 --> 27:29.163
Oh, I wouldn't
even if I could.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.164
I have no desire
to hurt our firm--

27:30.232 --> 27:32.333
your firm.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.603
Do you know
why I instituted

27:35.671 --> 27:38.272
the Louis Litt
rehabilitation program?

27:38.340 --> 27:42.310
Because I was seduced
by Daniel Hardman once too.

27:42.377 --> 27:47.882
He made me feel special
and smart and valued.

27:47.950 --> 27:49.550
The problem was

27:49.618 --> 27:52.820
he really didn't give
a shit about me.

27:52.888 --> 27:55.590
But I will give him
one thing.

27:55.657 --> 27:59.961
He was right
about you.

28:00.028 --> 28:04.966
You deserve
a senior partnership.

28:05.033 --> 28:08.035
[Scribbles]

28:08.103 --> 28:11.205
I'm gonna let you go,
Louis.

28:11.273 --> 28:12.874
Just for the record,

28:12.941 --> 28:16.477
I am not on the same page
as Harvey.

28:16.545 --> 28:19.247
I don't want you
to go.

28:34.663 --> 28:35.696
What?

28:35.764 --> 28:36.898
Were we really quitting,

28:36.965 --> 28:39.000
or was that just a move
to get to the contract?

28:39.067 --> 28:40.635
You don't think I have
his best interests at heart?

28:40.702 --> 28:42.069
That's not
what I asked.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.871
If it's a good deal,
he should take it.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.139
But you said
it's too good to be true.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.974
What else
did I say?

28:47.042 --> 28:48.163
That it's my job
to help you.

28:48.210 --> 28:49.543
So what are you gonna do?

28:49.611 --> 28:50.811
I'm gonna go find out
what's too good about it.

28:50.879 --> 28:51.913
Goodbye, Mike.

28:51.980 --> 28:52.880
Hey, you can quit
all you want,

28:52.948 --> 28:54.582

- For what?

Sleeping with my wife?

29:15.137 --> 29:17.071
What, you didn't do it
on purpose?

29:17.139 --> 29:18.306
It's over.
Okay?

Oh, I don't want
to talk about it.

This isn't

antibacterial cream?

Please, I might as well
give myself a staph infection.

It's antibacterial.

they want you to believe.

it's gonna bruise.

how to do this?

and ask a million questions

No, thanks.

that actions have consequences.

Okay.

I get it.
Yeah, I get that.

you were carrying?

31:33.968 --> 31:36.302
Oh, man.
What box?

31:36.370 --> 31:37.937
The box
full of personal things

31:38.005 --> 31:39.105
from your office?

31:39.173 --> 31:43.409
Like you said,
actions have consequences.

31:43.477 --> 31:45.645
- Jessica fired you.
- Mm-mm.

31:45.713 --> 31:48.748
She asked me to stay.
She did?

31:48.816 --> 31:49.916
Yeah,
because she knows

31:49.984 --> 31:51.217
that I would never sell out
this firm.

31:51.285 --> 31:52.385
Well, then I don't
understand, what are you--

to spell it out for you?

Jessica's the boss.

32:00.661 --> 32:02.328
No, actually.

32:02.396 --> 32:04.731
Harvey hasn't
always hated me.

32:04.799 --> 32:07.233
We were never
Elmer and Bugs.

32:07.301 --> 32:11.538
We were...
Ralph and Sam.

32:11.605 --> 32:12.739
Who?

32:12.807 --> 32:14.240
Ralph Wolf
and Sam Sheepdog.

32:14.308 --> 32:15.775
The cartoon characters?

32:15.843 --> 32:17.143
Yeah.

32:17.211 --> 32:20.280
They came to the meadow
every day to work, friendly.

32:20.347 --> 32:22.615
But then when they punched
in the time clock,

32:22.683 --> 32:24.083
Ralph would try
to steal the sheep,

32:24.151 --> 32:25.518
and Sam would stop him.

32:25.586 --> 32:29.422
I mean,
it was brutal.

32:29.490 --> 32:32.158
And then
they'd punch out again.

Friends.

32:34.128 --> 32:36.629
And that was
me and Harvey.

Harvey's not punching out
anymore.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.635

Mike, I can't.

32:51.078 --> 32:54.347
Louis,
if actions have consequences,

32:54.415 --> 32:57.917
then maybe actions
can redeem you.

32:57.985 --> 33:00.887
No,
it's too late for that.

to stay,

some merger projections

33:11.532 --> 33:12.765
that I have to go through
for Harvey.

33:12.833 --> 33:16.736

out of my depth.

33:21.909 --> 33:24.644
Thought I'd get in early
and destroy Allison Holt.

33:24.712 --> 33:25.845
How's that going?

33:25.913 --> 33:28.181
- It's a work in progress.
- Mm-hmm.

33:28.249 --> 33:30.216
Louis's letter
of resignation.

33:30.284 --> 33:31.564
Found it on my desk
this morning.

33:31.585 --> 33:32.619
- Good.
- No.

33:32.686 --> 33:35.521
Not good, Harvey.

33:35.589 --> 33:37.023
We can agree
to disagree.

33:37.091 --> 33:38.691
We're not agreeing
on anything.

33:38.759 --> 33:40.593
You pushed Louis
out the door.

33:40.661 --> 33:42.161
It was not your call
to make.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.831
Louis may or may not have
helped Allison,

33:44.899 --> 33:48.468
but he has betrayed you, me,
and this entire firm.

33:48.535 --> 33:49.469
We're better off.

33:49.536 --> 33:50.603
If you
really believe that,

33:50.671 --> 33:52.038
then something's
got you off your game.

33:52.106 --> 33:53.706
- Jessica, I'm not off my--
- No.

33:53.774 --> 33:56.042
Not you.
Me.

33:56.110 --> 33:59.012
Your job
is to help me.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.613
And when I say
you are off your game,

34:00.681 --> 34:02.682
you say,
"how do I get it back?"

34:02.750 --> 34:06.419
I went to Louis
to get him back on board,

34:06.487 --> 34:08.554
and you made an end run
around me.

34:08.621 --> 34:10.590
When does it stop?

34:10.658 --> 34:11.724
We can't let Trent go
with Allison.

34:11.792 --> 34:14.092
He's gonna...get screwed.

34:14.161 --> 34:18.130
I'm--I'm sorry.

34:18.197 --> 34:19.666
It's nothing.

34:19.733 --> 34:21.768
It's just some stairs.

34:23.203 --> 34:25.705
Oh, God.

34:25.773 --> 34:28.074
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see her there.

34:28.141 --> 34:29.242
Who did this to you?

34:29.310 --> 34:31.110
- I'm fine.
- You're not.

34:31.178 --> 34:32.612
And after I'm done
kicking his ass,

34:32.679 --> 34:34.112
the guy who did it
isn't gonna be either.

34:34.181 --> 34:35.949
- Harvey, just let it go.
- That's not who I am.

34:36.016 --> 34:38.484
I deserved it.

34:38.552 --> 34:41.754
- What did you do?
- I don't want to tell you.

34:41.822 --> 34:43.356
I wouldn't call this
getting your shit together.

34:43.424 --> 34:44.690
I don't want to tell you
because of the story

34:44.757 --> 34:48.761
you told me about your mom
and your dad.

34:50.664 --> 34:51.797
You got off easy.

34:51.864 --> 34:55.168
I know.

34:56.937 --> 34:58.237
It's a bad deal.

34:58.305 --> 34:59.739
What, you're reading
between the lines?

34:59.807 --> 35:01.975
'Cause I couldn't find anything
in the contract.

35:02.042 --> 35:03.977
Because the problem's
not in the contract.

35:04.044 --> 35:05.878
You said it yourself.
The deal's too good to be true.

35:05.946 --> 35:07.113
The financials
don't support it.

35:07.181 --> 35:08.815
What, you get your MBA
overnight?

35:08.882 --> 35:10.316
No.

35:10.384 --> 35:12.018
You went to Louis?

35:12.086 --> 35:13.386
We worked all night.

35:13.454 --> 35:14.754
He didn't betray us, Harvey.
He found the problem.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.856
They never wanted anything to do
with Trent's company.

35:16.924 --> 35:18.024
After the deal,
they're just gonna sell it off

35:18.092 --> 35:19.325
for spare parts.

35:19.393 --> 35:20.827
That won't get them
what they paid for it.

35:20.894 --> 35:22.294
But it'll get them
what they wanted.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.263
- Trent.
- Exactly.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.065
Louis figured this out?

35:26.133 --> 35:28.134
Trent's contract
has the same problem as Louis's.

35:28.202 --> 35:29.335
He's got a non-compete.

35:29.403 --> 35:30.470
They couldn't get him
to run the company

35:30.537 --> 35:31.471
unless they bought his.

35:31.538 --> 35:33.072
Now Louis wants back in.

35:33.140 --> 35:34.307
No, he doesn't.

35:34.375 --> 35:38.011
This is just his way
of saying he's sorry.

35:44.745 --> 35:46.979
It's not on the menu,
but might I suggest

35:47.047 --> 35:48.447
the "I got my ass kicked"
Martini?

35:48.515 --> 35:49.682
It goes well

35:49.750 --> 35:51.250
with the "second-tier law firm"
potato skins.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.518
Those come
with bacon?

35:52.586 --> 35:54.920
I don't know,
never had 'em.

35:54.988 --> 35:56.822
I take it
my client's not coming.

35:56.890 --> 35:58.157
He was your client,

35:58.225 --> 36:00.359
but then you offered him
a deal too good to be true.

36:00.427 --> 36:03.229
You got
the paperwork.

36:03.296 --> 36:05.598
Because he trusted me.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.233
Well played, Harvey.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.001
No.
Here's the play.

36:09.069 --> 36:10.703
He's gonna take
his company public,

36:10.771 --> 36:12.371
like I told him to
months ago.

36:12.439 --> 36:15.541
A deal my new client,
a certain hedge fund,

36:15.609 --> 36:17.276
just agreed
to underwrite.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.211
You know Edelson Investments,
don't you?

36:19.279 --> 36:20.379
I do.

36:20.447 --> 36:22.348
Apparently,
I used to represent them.

36:22.416 --> 36:24.016
Ah,
you're taking this well.

36:24.084 --> 36:25.918
What do you want me to do,
cry?

36:25.986 --> 36:27.219
Harvey,
we play the game.

36:27.287 --> 36:29.622
Sometimes we win,
sometimes we lose.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.090
Not me.

36:31.158 --> 36:34.627
Which brings me
to a suggestion of my own.

36:34.694 --> 36:36.462
Come work
for Bratton Gould.

36:36.530 --> 36:37.696
Come work for <i>you?</i>

36:37.764 --> 36:39.065
<i>With</i> me.

36:39.132 --> 36:41.172
Did you not hear what I said
about the potato skins?

36:41.234 --> 36:42.668
You're second-tier.

36:42.736 --> 36:43.969
What about you?

36:44.037 --> 36:45.838
There's blood in the water,
Harvey.

36:45.906 --> 36:47.006
You may have fended off
this attack,

36:47.074 --> 36:48.674
but we're not
the only ones circling.

36:48.742 --> 36:51.210
We fended you off,
we'll fend off the rest.

36:51.278 --> 36:52.411
With who?

36:52.479 --> 36:54.447
I got all
your best senior associates,

36:54.514 --> 36:56.515
your future,
and I'm not done.

36:56.583 --> 36:58.551
We'll see
about that.

36:58.618 --> 37:01.153
Lunch is on us.

37:01.221 --> 37:03.722
After all, we just landed
a huge, new client.

37:03.790 --> 37:06.192
You say "we,"
but I don't see

37:06.259 --> 37:09.161
your name
on the door.

37:09.229 --> 37:10.796
Mike, Mike, Mike.
I got your call.

37:10.864 --> 37:12.565
You said you owed me one,
right?

37:12.632 --> 37:13.833
Yeah,
and I meant it too.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.134
Well,
you're gonna pay me back.

37:15.202 --> 37:17.536
I'm happy to,
'cause listen to me,

37:17.604 --> 37:18.838
when I bring you in,

37:18.905 --> 37:20.940
and you kick ass,
I look kick-ass.

37:21.007 --> 37:24.710
Got your resume?
Right there.

37:26.513 --> 37:27.847
You gotta be kidding me.

37:27.914 --> 37:28.948
Oh, you didn't think
it was gonna be easy

37:29.015 --> 37:29.949
to pay me back,
did you?

37:30.016 --> 37:31.317
Harold?

37:31.384 --> 37:32.985
I'm not gonna look kick-ass.

37:33.053 --> 37:34.620
I'm gonna look ass-kicked.

37:34.688 --> 37:37.022
Look at how he did.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.390
Are you kidding me?

37:38.458 --> 37:39.592
You keep saying that.

37:39.659 --> 37:40.860
Man, we talking
about the same Harold?

37:40.927 --> 37:42.461
I know.

37:42.529 --> 37:43.863
Seriously,
Mike, man,

37:43.930 --> 37:45.464
if this doesn't work,
I'm gonna look like shit.

37:45.532 --> 37:48.000
Jimmy,
he needs a second chance

37:48.068 --> 37:49.235
just like you did.

37:49.302 --> 37:51.570
[Sighs]
All right, all right.

37:51.638 --> 37:53.172
You won't regret it.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.206
Harold's great.

37:54.274 --> 37:57.176
You're gonna love
his new tattoo.

37:57.244 --> 37:58.177
He's here,
isn't he?

37:58.245 --> 38:01.814
Right over there.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.691
Not only do you retain
one client,

38:12.759 --> 38:14.026
you landed another.

38:14.094 --> 38:16.061
I knew there was a reason
why I kept you around.

38:16.129 --> 38:18.764
And a reason Allison Holt's
trying to steal me away.

38:18.832 --> 38:21.567
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

38:21.635 --> 38:23.302
What could possibly
go wrong?

38:23.370 --> 38:25.738
Congratulations.
That's what I said to Mike.

38:25.805 --> 38:27.907
Him too?
She's after everyone.

38:27.974 --> 38:29.275
Don't worry.
He's staying.

38:29.342 --> 38:30.743
Loyal as a basset hound.

38:30.810 --> 38:33.279
Oh.
Are they particularly loyal?

38:33.346 --> 38:37.583
I turned her down.

38:37.651 --> 38:38.584
But?

38:38.652 --> 38:41.654
I want my name
on the door.

38:41.721 --> 38:45.691
I don't want to end
around you anymore.

38:45.759 --> 38:49.328
I want to discuss things
with you as an equal.

38:49.396 --> 38:51.163
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?

38:51.231 --> 38:54.466
How long are we gonna walk
by his name on the wall, huh?

38:54.534 --> 38:55.935
They're coming
after us,

38:56.002 --> 38:58.337
and they're not gonna stop
until we send them a message

38:58.405 --> 38:59.471
that we are whole.

38:59.539 --> 39:01.040
I'm not gonna just slap

39:01.107 --> 39:02.841
someone else's name up there,
Harvey.

39:02.909 --> 39:05.444
- "Someone"?
- I told you once.

39:05.512 --> 39:07.947
You don't make decisions
when you're reeling from a loss.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.983
And your response was,
"let's quit today."

39:11.051 --> 39:12.618
Not quit.
Fight.

39:12.686 --> 39:14.553
Without any thought
for the consequences.

39:14.621 --> 39:16.655
With my gut,
which serves me well.

39:16.723 --> 39:18.490
As a closer,
not a leader.

39:18.558 --> 39:19.592
Jessica.

39:19.659 --> 39:21.026
Watson, Klyman,

39:21.094 --> 39:22.861
Gallo, Goldberg, Specter.

39:22.929 --> 39:24.830
The first five senior partners
you named.

39:24.898 --> 39:27.266
The first five major moves
I made.

39:27.334 --> 39:29.201
All success stories.

39:29.269 --> 39:31.370
Last week,
you had me steal someone

39:31.438 --> 39:33.906
from the D.A.'s office
for reasons you won't say.

39:33.974 --> 39:36.041
We won't even go
into what you did to Louis.

39:36.109 --> 39:38.010
And then
there's the cherry on top.

39:38.078 --> 39:39.478
- Mike.
- Who showed up this morning

39:39.479 --> 39:41.513
beaten to a pulp.

39:41.581 --> 39:42.881
He also beat Hardman
to a pulp.

39:42.949 --> 39:45.417
One day, what he is
isn't going to be enough

39:45.485 --> 39:47.386
to make up
for what he isn't.

39:47.454 --> 39:51.090
Which is
how you feel about me.

39:51.157 --> 39:53.692
Harvey, what was
Michael Jordan's record

39:53.760 --> 39:54.727
on the Bulls?

39:54.794 --> 39:57.563
664 wins,
285 losses.

39:57.631 --> 40:00.266
More than twice as many wins
than losses.

40:00.333 --> 40:03.569
Do you know what his record was
in the front office?

40:03.637 --> 40:05.904
- No.
- 185 to 291.

40:05.972 --> 40:09.541
Almost twice as many losses
as wins.

40:09.609 --> 40:10.876
You know
how I know that?

40:10.944 --> 40:12.711
Because you knew one day,
I'd come in here

40:12.779 --> 40:15.948
asking for this.

40:16.016 --> 40:17.850
Because I look
at the future

40:17.917 --> 40:20.586
like an adult.

40:20.654 --> 40:22.921
Are you saying
it's a no?

40:22.989 --> 40:27.226
I'm saying
I'm not rushing this decision

40:27.294 --> 40:30.229
and that your judgment
that day was wrong.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.505
Thank you.

40:41.574 --> 40:43.208
[Clears throat]

40:43.276 --> 40:46.712
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:46.780 --> 40:48.247
I thought
you'd like to know

40:48.315 --> 40:52.851
that Harold got a job
at another firm.

40:52.919 --> 40:54.714
Good.

40:56.990 --> 40:58.223
Look, Rachel--

40:58.291 --> 41:01.894
He found out,
didn't he?

41:01.961 --> 41:03.529
I just want you
to know that it was

41:03.596 --> 41:07.099
after I ended things
with Tess.

41:07.167 --> 41:11.603
I want you to know
that I just don't give a shit.
