>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:36.033 --> 00:37.033
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:37.100 --> 00:38.033
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.100 --> 00:38.900
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:38.967 --> 00:39.834
US.

00:39.900 --> 00:40.900
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:40.967 --> 00:42.066
THE WEEK.

00:42.133 --> 00:42.934
AND WE BEGIN WITH NORTH KOREA,

00:43.000 --> 00:44.066
VOTED "TOP KOREA" BY

00:44.133 --> 00:45.233
"WE MEANT IT GEOGRAPHICALLY"

00:45.300 --> 00:49.100
MAGAZINE.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.367
NOW, THIS WEEK, THE JUNE 12

00:51.433 --> 00:52.867
SUMMIT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND

00:52.934 --> 00:56.500
NORTH KOREA WAS SUDDENLY BACK

00:56.567 --> 00:58.734
ON AFTER TRUMP MET WITH A

00:58.800 --> 01:00.000
NORTH KOREAN ENVOY WHO HAD

01:00.066 --> 01:00.867
BROUGHT HIM THIS

01:00.934 --> 01:01.734
GIGANTIC, COMICALLY-OVERSIZED

01:01.800 --> 01:02.567
LETTER FROM KIM JONG UN.

01:02.633 --> 01:03.467
AND AS IF SMILING WHILE HOLDING

01:03.533 --> 01:04.100
A LETTER FROM A DICTATOR WEREN'T

01:04.166 --> 01:04.967
ENOUGH OF A PROPAGANDA COUP

01:05.033 --> 01:05.667
FOR NORTH KOREA,

01:05.734 --> 01:07.834
THE PRESIDENT THEN RAVED ABOUT

01:07.900 --> 01:08.567
THE LETTER TO THE PRESS.

01:08.633 --> 01:09.467
>> OH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE

01:09.533 --> 01:11.767
WHAT WAS IN THAT LETTER?

01:11.834 --> 01:12.600
WOULD YOU?

01:12.667 --> 01:13.533
HOW MUCH?

01:13.600 --> 01:14.233
HOW MUCH?

01:14.300 --> 01:15.533
IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING

01:15.600 --> 01:16.533
LETTER, AND AT SOME POINT I MAY

01:16.600 --> 01:17.734
BE -- IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE,

01:17.800 --> 01:18.633
I'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE IT TO YOU,

01:18.700 --> 01:19.500
MAYBE.

01:19.567 --> 01:20.333
>> John: WOW.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.600
AS INFURIATING A PRESIDENT AS

01:21.667 --> 01:23.066
TRUMP IS, HE'D BE AN EVEN WORSE

01:23.133 --> 01:26.600
MOSES.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.133
"OH, OH, WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO

01:28.200 --> 01:28.934
SEE WHAT'S ON THESE TABLETS?

01:29.000 --> 01:29.934
HOW MUCH?

01:30.000 --> 01:30.700
HOW MUCH?

01:30.767 --> 01:31.767
MAYBE I'LL SHOW YOU LATER.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.033
IF YOU'RE LUCKY."

01:33.100 --> 01:34.834
AND IF THAT WASN'T WEIRD ENOUGH,

01:34.900 --> 01:36.233
JUST EIGHT MINUTES LATER, AFTER

01:36.300 --> 01:37.233
CALLING THE CONTENTS OF THE

01:37.300 --> 01:38.533
LETTER INTERESTING, THIS

01:38.600 --> 01:39.834
HAPPENED.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.000
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LETTER

01:41.066 --> 01:42.367
YET.

01:42.433 --> 01:43.233
I PURPOSELY DIDN'T OPEN THE

01:43.300 --> 01:44.133
LETTER.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.000
I HAVEN'T OPENED IT.

01:45.066 --> 01:46.033
I DIDN'T OPEN IT IN FRONT OF THE

01:46.100 --> 01:47.200
DIRECTOR.

01:47.266 --> 01:48.300
I SAID, "WOULD YOU WANT ME TO

01:48.367 --> 01:49.400
OPEN IT?"

01:49.467 --> 01:51.066
HE SAID, "YOU CAN READ IT

01:51.133 --> 01:51.734
LATER."

01:51.800 --> 01:52.800
I MAY BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE,

01:52.867 --> 01:55.533
FOLKS!

01:55.600 --> 01:58.600
>> John: YEAH, YOU MIGHT THOUGH!

01:58.667 --> 01:59.967
'CAUSE YOU JUST AGREED TO A

02:00.033 --> 02:01.233
SUMMIT WITHOUT READING THE

02:01.300 --> 02:02.700
CONTENTS OF THE LETTER THAT

02:02.767 --> 02:03.300
SUPPOSEDLY CONVINCED YOU TO DO

02:03.367 --> 02:04.200
IT.

02:04.266 --> 02:04.834
SO WORST-CASE SCENARIO, IT'S A

02:04.900 --> 02:05.800
DECLARATION OF WAR.

02:05.867 --> 02:06.600
BEST-CASE SCENARIO, IT SAYS,

02:06.667 --> 02:07.700
"DONALD, IT'S ME.

02:07.767 --> 02:08.934
I HAVE RUN AWAY TO NORTH KOREA

02:09.000 --> 02:10.066
AND I'M NEVER COMING BACK.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.900
MELANIA -- BRACKETS -- YOUR

02:11.967 --> 02:14.767
THIRD WIFE."

02:14.834 --> 02:16.734
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO

02:16.800 --> 02:18.233
UKRAINE.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.433
OR AS VLADIMIR PUTIN CALLS IT,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.133
"BONUS RUSSIA."

02:22.200 --> 02:23.667
UKRAINE WAS ROCKED THIS WEEK BY

02:23.734 --> 02:25.834
SOME HORRIFYING NEWS.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.166
>> A PROMINENT RUSSIAN

02:27.233 --> 02:29.700
JOURNALIST CRITICAL OF MOSCOW'S

02:29.767 --> 02:31.400
POLICIES IN UKRAINE AND SYRIA

02:31.467 --> 02:32.200
HAS BEEN SHOT AND KILLED IN

02:32.266 --> 02:34.133
KIEV.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.834
>> John: YES, ARKADY BABCHENKO,

02:35.900 --> 02:36.800
A PROMINENT PUTIN CRITIC, WAS

02:36.867 --> 02:37.700
TRAGICALLY MURDERED ON TUESDAY.

02:37.767 --> 02:39.300
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE WHAT

02:39.367 --> 02:40.600
HAPPENED ON WEDNESDAY EVEN MORE

02:40.667 --> 02:41.967
REMARKABLE.

02:42.033 --> 02:44.734
>> HIS FRIENDS, HIS FAMILY, EVEN

02:44.800 --> 02:46.934
HIS WIFE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

02:51.767 --> 02:52.867
BUT TODAY, A SHOCKING TURN OF

02:52.934 --> 02:54.133
EVENTS.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.500
A RUSSIAN JOURNALIST,

02:55.567 --> 02:56.800
ARKADY BABCHENKO, TURNED UP

02:56.867 --> 02:58.533
ALIVE ON UKRAINIAN TV.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.700
AS IT TURNS OUT, HIS FAKE DEATH

03:00.767 --> 03:01.967
WAS ALL PART OF WHAT WAS

03:02.033 --> 03:03.300
DESCRIBED AS A SPECIAL OPERATION

03:03.367 --> 03:05.166
TO TAKE DOWN A TEAM OF RUSSIAN

03:05.233 --> 03:06.567
ASSASSINS.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.567
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.567
BABCHENKO FAKED HIS DEATH TO

03:10.633 --> 03:12.033
BRING DOWN A TEAM OF RUSSIAN

03:12.100 --> 03:13.200
ASSASSINS, WHICH SOUNDS LESS

03:13.266 --> 03:14.367
LIKE A LEGITIMATE NEWS STORY

03:14.433 --> 03:15.367
THAN THE PLOT OF A SPY THRILLER

03:15.433 --> 03:16.433
CALLED "YOUR DAD WOULD REALLY

03:16.500 --> 03:19.166
LOVE THIS BOOK."

03:19.233 --> 03:20.233
APPARENTLY, THE PLAN TO FAKE HIS

03:20.300 --> 03:21.900
DEATH CAME ABOUT AFTER

03:21.967 --> 03:23.333
AUTHORITIES LEARNED OF A $40,000

03:23.400 --> 03:24.500
CONTRACT TO ASSASSINATE HIM,

03:24.567 --> 03:25.900
PAID FOR BY RUSSIAN FORCES.

03:25.967 --> 03:27.633
THE PLOT WAS ALLEGEDLY ORGANIZED

03:27.700 --> 03:28.800
BY A MAN IDENTIFIED ONLY AS

03:28.867 --> 03:29.867
"MR. G."

03:29.934 --> 03:31.467
WHICH I ASSUME REFERS TO THIS

03:31.533 --> 03:32.934
MAN.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.433
THAT'S RIGHT, KENNY, YOUR COVER

03:34.500 --> 03:36.166
IS FINALLY BLOWN!

03:36.233 --> 03:37.500
AND IT'S OBVIOUS IN HINDSIGHT --

03:37.567 --> 03:39.233
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T PLAY JAZZ AS

03:39.300 --> 03:40.633
SMOOTH AS THAT WITHOUT SECRETLY

03:40.700 --> 03:42.233
BEING A MONSTER.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.967
AND SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THIS

03:44.033 --> 03:46.000
FAKE ASSASSINATION ARE AMAZING.

03:46.066 --> 03:47.767
APPARENTLY, A MAKE-UP ARTIST

03:47.834 --> 03:49.233
CAME TO BABCHENKO'S APARTMENT TO

03:49.300 --> 03:50.834
STAGE HIS DEATH, AND HIS WIFE

03:50.900 --> 03:52.100
LATER FOUND HIM LIKE THIS, LYING

03:52.166 --> 03:53.633
FACEDOWN IN A POOL OF HIS OWN

03:53.700 --> 03:54.433
BLOOD.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.500
WHICH, IT TURNS OUT, WAS

03:55.567 --> 03:57.367
ACTUALLY PIG'S BLOOD.

03:57.433 --> 03:58.767
HE WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO AN

03:58.834 --> 04:00.667
AMBULANCE, PRONOUNCED DEAD, AND

04:00.734 --> 04:01.734
TAKEN TO A MORGUE WHERE,

04:01.800 --> 04:02.734
ACCORDING TO HIM, HE TURNED ON

04:02.800 --> 04:04.100
THE TV AND WATCHED THE NEWS OF

04:04.166 --> 04:05.166
HIS OWN MURDER.

04:05.233 --> 04:06.533
WHICH IS OBJECTIVELY PRETTY

04:06.600 --> 04:08.533
COOL.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.734
THE ONLY WAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN

04:09.800 --> 04:10.834
COOLER IS IF HE WATCHED IT WHILE

04:10.900 --> 04:11.967
SIPPING COCKTAILS ON A CARIBBEAN

04:12.033 --> 04:15.567
BEACH WITH TUPAC SHAKUR.

04:15.633 --> 04:17.000
AND, LOOK, HIS COWORKERS WERE

04:17.066 --> 04:19.500
UNDERSTANDABLY AMAZED BY THE

04:19.567 --> 04:22.166
SURPRISE NEWS CONFERENCE.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.867
>> John: I MEAN, THAT IS TRULY

04:32.934 --> 04:34.266
INCREDIBLE TO WATCH, MAINLY

04:34.333 --> 04:35.400
BECAUSE OF HOW REFRESHING IT IS

04:35.467 --> 04:37.500
TO SEE AN OFFICE WHERE PEOPLE

04:37.567 --> 04:39.200
ACTUALLY LIKE THEIR COWORKERS.

04:39.266 --> 04:40.600
NORMALLY IF AN OFFICE FOUND OUT

04:40.667 --> 04:42.900
A COWORKER THEY THOUGHT HAD DIED

04:42.967 --> 04:43.633
WAS ACTUALLY ALIVE, THEY'D JUST

04:43.700 --> 04:44.834
QUIETLY NOD AND GO RIGHT BACK TO

04:44.900 --> 04:45.934
TALKING SHIT ABOUT HIM ON GCHAT.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.133
SOME OF YOU LAUGHED TOO HARD AT

04:51.200 --> 04:53.400
BUT OTHER MEDIA -- SOME OF YOU

04:53.467 --> 04:54.734
LAUGHED TOO HARD AT THAT.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.700
BUT OTHER MEDIA COLLEAGUES WERE

04:55.767 --> 04:56.600
NOT QUITE AS THRILLED, AS CNN

04:56.667 --> 04:57.767
DISCOVERED WHEN THEY REACHED ONE

04:57.834 --> 04:59.767
OF HIS FRIENDS ON THE PHONE.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.567
>> I THINK THE OVERRIDING

05:01.633 --> 05:03.467
EMOTION THAT WE ALL HAVE RIGHT

05:03.533 --> 05:05.633
NOW IS, THAT YOU KNOW, WE'RE

05:05.700 --> 05:08.667
VERY -- WE'RE VERY PISSED OFF.

05:08.734 --> 05:10.166
BECAUSE HE SORT OF PUT US

05:10.233 --> 05:12.133
THROUGH HELL.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.133
>> John: YEAH.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.066
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:14.133 --> 05:15.367
THAT'S AN UNDERSTANDABLE

05:15.433 --> 05:18.934
RESPONSE.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.200
APOSTLE PAUL'S FIRST WORDS TO

05:20.266 --> 05:21.166
THE RESURRECTED JESUS WERE,

05:21.233 --> 05:22.133
"REAL FUNNY, SHITBIRD."

05:22.200 --> 05:23.066
AND IT WASN'T JUST HIS

05:23.133 --> 05:23.934
COLLEAGUES WITH CAUSE TO BE

05:24.000 --> 05:26.834
ANGRY, AS A LONDON RADIO HOST

05:26.900 --> 05:27.934
POINTED OUT.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.033
>> HE APOLOGIZED TO HIS WIFE.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.467
WAIT FOR THIS, GOOD LORD.

05:30.533 --> 05:31.800
HE APOLOGIZED TO HIS WIFE

05:31.867 --> 05:33.834
BECAUSE SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT

05:33.900 --> 05:35.400
ANY OF THIS, SO WHEN SHE FOUND

05:35.467 --> 05:37.066
HER HUSBAND AT THE FOOT OF THE

05:37.133 --> 05:38.734
STAIRS IN A POOL OF BLOOD HAVING

05:38.800 --> 05:42.233
APPARENTLY BEEN SHOT IN THE

05:42.300 --> 05:43.467
BACK, THAT WAS ALL -- THAT WAS

05:43.533 --> 05:45.467
VERY REAL TO HER.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.066
THAT IS -- MY GOODNESS ME.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.433
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A BUNCH

05:48.500 --> 05:49.600
OF FLOWERS TO GET OVER THAT,

05:49.667 --> 05:50.834
ISN'T IT?

05:50.900 --> 05:51.600
>> John: IT IS.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.266
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.266
HE PROBABLY SHOULD GET HIS WIFE

05:53.333 --> 05:54.133
SOME FLOWERS.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.000
HE WON'T HAVE TO SPEND ANY

05:55.066 --> 06:00.433
MONEY ON THEM, SINCE HE CAN PICK

06:00.500 --> 06:01.100
UP A TON FOR FREE AT HIS OWN

06:01.166 --> 06:01.867
GRAVE.

06:01.934 --> 06:03.200
NOW, LATER REPORTS INDICATED

06:03.266 --> 06:03.934
THAT BABCHENKO'S WIFE WAS

06:04.000 --> 06:07.166
ACTUALLY ALSO IN ON THE HOAX.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.367
BUT AT THIS POINT, WHO CAN KNOW

06:08.433 --> 06:08.767
ANYTHING ANYMORE?

06:08.834 --> 06:09.300
IS HE EVEN MARRIED?

06:09.367 --> 06:11.333
OR IS HIS WIFE JUST BABCHENKO

06:11.400 --> 06:12.066
IN A DRESS, HOLDING A FAKE

06:12.133 --> 06:12.767
PASSPORT, READY TO FLEE THE

06:12.834 --> 06:15.233
COUNTRY?

06:15.300 --> 06:16.233
AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM, AND

06:16.300 --> 06:17.233
IT'S WHY SOME REPORTERS

06:17.300 --> 06:18.567
CRITICIZED BABCHENKO, ARGUING

06:18.633 --> 06:19.767
THIS PLAYS INTO RUSSIA'S HANDS

06:19.834 --> 06:20.867
IN DISMISSING ACTUAL CRIMES AS

06:20.934 --> 06:24.967
"FAKE NEWS."

06:25.033 --> 06:26.133
AND BABCHENKO HAS BEEN

06:26.200 --> 06:27.567
BORDERLINE COCKY IN THE WAKE OF

06:27.633 --> 06:28.867
THIS OPERATION.

06:28.934 --> 06:30.433
>> HAVING CHEATED DEATH,

06:30.500 --> 06:32.600
ARKADY BABCHENKO SAYS HE WILL

06:32.667 --> 06:34.000
LIVE TO DANCE ON

06:34.066 --> 06:35.133
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S GRAVE.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.300
>> John: WELL, I HOPE THAT'S

06:39.367 --> 06:40.400
TRUE, BABS, BUT I WOULDN'T

06:40.467 --> 06:40.934
BE SO SURE.

06:41.033 --> 06:41.800
FIRST, YOU'RE IMPLYING THAT

06:41.867 --> 06:42.700
BECAUSE YOU SUCCESSFULLY FAKED

06:42.767 --> 06:44.266
YOUR DEATH, YOU'RE SOMEHOW

06:44.333 --> 06:45.767
IMMUNE FROM FUTURE

06:45.834 --> 06:46.533
ASSASSINATION, WHICH I DON'T

06:46.600 --> 06:47.200
THINK IS HOW ANYTHING WORKS.

06:47.266 --> 06:48.667
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU'RE

06:48.734 --> 06:49.300
ASSUMING THAT PUTIN WILL END UP

06:49.367 --> 06:50.934
IN A GRAVE, AND THERE'S NO WAY

06:51.000 --> 06:55.867
THAT'S TRUE, BECAUSE WHEN PUTIN

06:55.934 --> 06:57.333
DOES DIE IN 400 YEARS, HIS BODY

06:57.400 --> 06:58.834
WILL SIMPLY EXPLODE INTO

06:58.900 --> 07:00.000
HUNDREDS OF BATS THAT SCATTER

07:00.066 --> 07:03.633
INTO THE NIGHT SKY.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.433
THAT IS SIMPLY A FACT.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.867
AND FINALLY TONIGHT, THE

07:06.934 --> 07:08.300
UNITED KINGDOM, WHERE, NOW THAT

07:08.367 --> 07:09.633
PRINCE HARRY IS OFF THE MARKET,

07:09.700 --> 07:12.433
THE COUNTRY'S MOST ELIGIBLE

07:12.500 --> 07:13.100
BACHELOR IS THIS MAN, MERVYN

07:13.166 --> 07:13.767
GURZCROP-CRAWLINGS, FROM THE

07:13.834 --> 07:14.633
VILLAGE OF MUDFORD SOCK.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.266
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU, SO COULD YOU

07:15.333 --> 07:16.567
PLEASE SPEAK UP?

07:16.633 --> 07:18.333
OH, AND HE'S 32 YEARS OLD.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.166
SO YOUR MOVE, LADIES.

07:20.233 --> 07:21.600
NOW, IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE TENS

07:21.667 --> 07:22.567
OF MILLIONS WHO WATCHED LAST

07:22.633 --> 07:23.967
MONTH'S ROYAL WEDDING, YOU MIGHT

07:24.033 --> 07:25.033
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER SEEING THIS

07:25.100 --> 07:26.300
MAN, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH

07:26.367 --> 07:27.467
MONARCHIST SOCIETY, WHO APPEARED

07:27.533 --> 07:28.633
ON TV TO PROVIDE COLOR

07:28.700 --> 07:29.600
COMMENTARY ABOUT THE ROYAL

07:29.667 --> 07:30.967
FAMILY.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.367
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS QUITE

07:32.433 --> 07:33.967
THE CHANGE.

07:34.033 --> 07:34.767
I MEAN, SHE'S BROUGHT A

07:34.834 --> 07:37.133
CALIFORNIA LIFESTYLE TO BRITAIN.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.133
SHE'S SLIMMING HIM DOWN, SHE'S

07:38.200 --> 07:39.500
PUTTING HIM ON SHAKES, EATING

07:39.567 --> 07:40.900
LESS MEAT -- WHAT BRIT DO YOU

07:40.967 --> 07:43.166
KNOW THAT DOESN'T LIKE MEAT?

07:43.233 --> 07:44.133
>> John: OH, I'LL TAKE THIS ONE:

07:44.200 --> 07:49.600
MORRISEY.

07:49.667 --> 07:50.333
I MEAN, PRETTY FAMOUSLY,

07:50.400 --> 07:51.000
MORRISEY.

07:51.066 --> 07:51.800
OFFER HIM A STEAK SOMETIME AND

07:51.867 --> 07:52.567
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

07:52.633 --> 07:54.166
THAT MAN IS THOMAS J.

07:54.233 --> 07:54.767
MACE-ARCHER-MILLS ESQUIRE, AND

07:54.834 --> 07:55.767
IF YOU THINK THAT'S THE MOST

07:55.834 --> 07:58.000
BRITISH HE GETS, JUST LOOK AT

07:58.066 --> 07:59.934
THIS ACTUAL PHOTO OF HIM, TAKEN,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.934
I ASSUME, AT THE

08:02.000 --> 08:03.367
"ALICE IN WONDERLAND" WRAP PARTY

08:03.433 --> 08:04.900
OR IN THE YEAR 1865, THE ONLY

08:04.967 --> 08:05.533
TWO TIMES THAT OUTFIT SHOULD BE

08:05.600 --> 08:07.967
LEGAL.

08:08.033 --> 08:09.066
WELL, THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED

08:09.133 --> 08:11.567
SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.700
>> THIS ROYAL EXPERT SURE SEEMED

08:13.767 --> 08:15.600
LIKE THE REAL DEAL.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.367
>> WHAT MEGHAN WORE WAS

08:17.433 --> 08:19.000
ABSOLUTELY IDEAL FOR THE

08:19.066 --> 08:19.967
CEREMONY.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.266
>> BUT GET THIS: THIS ROYAL

08:21.333 --> 08:24.500
EXPERT IS FROM NEW YORK.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.200
HE WAS BORN TOMMY MUSCATELLO IN

08:26.266 --> 08:28.100
THE SMALL UPSTATE TOWN OF

08:28.166 --> 08:30.333
BOLTON LANDING.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.800
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.200
THAT BRITISH MAN IS ACTUALLY

08:33.266 --> 08:38.967
TOMMY MUSCATELLO FROM NEW YORK.

08:39.033 --> 08:40.367
AND THAT IS A DESTABILIZING

08:40.433 --> 08:41.033
THING TO LEARN.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.133
BECAUSE IF THIS GUY ISN'T

08:43.200 --> 08:44.166
BRITISH, WHO THE FUCK IS?

08:44.233 --> 08:47.033
AM I ACTUALLY BRITISH?

08:47.100 --> 08:49.834
WELL, LET ME REASSURE YOU:

08:49.900 --> 08:52.867
MY PARENTS ARE LISTED IN MY

08:52.934 --> 08:53.834
PHONE AS "MR. AND MRS. OLIVER."

08:53.900 --> 08:54.834
SO I AM DEFINITELY BRITISH.

08:54.900 --> 08:55.834
AND WHAT'S MOST GALLING ABOUT

08:55.900 --> 08:56.734
TOMMY MUSCATELLO IS THAT, AS A

08:56.800 --> 08:57.934
DEFENDER OF THE MONARCHY, HE

08:58.000 --> 08:59.133
USED HIS AIRTIME TO ARGUE THAT

08:59.200 --> 09:00.266
MEGHAN MARKLE WAS A BRASH

09:00.333 --> 09:01.400
INTERLOPER WHO NEEDED TO PROCEED

09:01.467 --> 09:04.500
WITH CARE.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.433
>> YOU DO NOT UPSTAGE THE FUTURE

09:07.500 --> 09:08.300
QUEEN OF THIS COUNTRY,

09:08.367 --> 09:09.834
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE COMING IN

09:09.900 --> 09:13.300
THE WAY YOU ARE.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.266
WHEN YOU START TO TAKE THE

09:15.333 --> 09:16.333
SPOTLIGHT FROM SOMEONE LIKE

09:16.400 --> 09:18.500
CATHERINE AND THEN YOU SWOOP

09:18.567 --> 09:22.967
INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM,

09:23.033 --> 09:24.300
"HERE I AM -- AMERICAN!"

09:24.367 --> 09:25.233
AND YOU'RE WANTING TO REALLY

09:25.300 --> 09:25.867
UPSTAGE THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE

09:25.934 --> 09:26.633
AND THE FUTURE QUEEN?

09:26.700 --> 09:27.433
I WON'T HAVE IT.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.867
>> John: OH, YOU WON'T HAVE IT,

09:28.934 --> 09:32.066
WILL YOU?

09:32.133 --> 09:33.066
YOU WON'T HAVE IT?

09:33.133 --> 09:33.967
WELL, LET ME MAKE THIS PERFECTLY

09:34.033 --> 09:37.033
CLEAR: MEGHAN MARKLE'S AMERICAN

09:37.100 --> 09:37.600
PASSPORT IS NOT AN INSULT TO

09:37.667 --> 09:38.200
ANYONE.

09:38.266 --> 09:39.166
THE NAME "THOMAS J.

09:39.233 --> 09:40.166
MACE-ARCHER-MILLS ESQUIRE,"

09:40.233 --> 09:43.567
HOWEVER, IS OFFENSIVELY BRITISH.

09:43.633 --> 09:45.133
THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A

09:45.200 --> 09:46.867
BRITISH PERSON PRETENDING TO BE

09:46.934 --> 09:48.033
AN AMERICAN AND CALLING YOURSELF

09:48.100 --> 09:48.934
"JEFFERSON BUDWEISER

09:49.000 --> 09:51.700
McNUGGETS JR."

09:51.767 --> 09:54.200
IT'S ACTIVELY RACIST.

09:54.266 --> 09:55.934
AND SINCE HE WAS OUTED AS AN

09:56.000 --> 09:57.500
AMERICAN, HE'S DONE A ROUND OF

09:57.567 --> 09:58.400
INTERVIEWS IN WHICH HE DOUBLES

09:58.467 --> 09:59.367
DOWN ON BRITISHNESS, AND IT'S A

09:59.433 --> 10:00.266
BLOODY BRILLIANT RUBBISH FIRE TO

10:00.333 --> 10:01.500
BEHOLD.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.700
JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

10:03.767 --> 10:04.734
HE WAS ASKED A PRETTY OBVIOUS

10:04.800 --> 10:05.333
QUESTION.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.000
>> I HAVE TO ASK YOU, HOW DID

10:09.066 --> 10:10.166
YOU GET YOUR BRITISH ACCENT?

10:10.233 --> 10:12.667
>> IT'S WHAT I WAS TAUGHT.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.266
IT'S WHAT I STUDY TO ONLINE

10:14.333 --> 10:15.467
COURSES AND ALSO PRACTICING WITH

10:15.533 --> 10:18.100
MY PEOPLE THAT I CONSIDER CLOSE

10:18.166 --> 10:24.300
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

10:24.367 --> 10:27.633
>> John: OH, DO YOU?

10:27.700 --> 10:27.900
MARVELOUS.

10:27.967 --> 10:28.700
ONLINE COURSES?

10:28.767 --> 10:29.567
THAT SOUNDS LIKE BULLSHIT,

10:29.633 --> 10:30.467
UNLESS UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX

10:30.533 --> 10:31.333
OFFERS A CLASS CALLED "HOW TO

10:31.400 --> 10:32.300
CONVINCE PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT FROM

10:32.367 --> 10:34.367
UPSTATE NEW YORK BY DRESSING

10:34.433 --> 10:35.734
LIKE MR. TOAD AND DOING A

10:35.800 --> 10:37.300
C- HUGH GRANT IMPRESSION."

10:37.367 --> 10:38.200
AND IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING

10:38.266 --> 10:39.667
ABOUT THAT "CLOSE FRIENDS AND

10:39.734 --> 10:41.100
FAMILY" LINE, HE APPARENTLY HAS

10:41.166 --> 10:42.333
AN AGREEMENT WITH TWO UNRELATED

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
ELDERLY BRITISH INDIVIDUALS TO

10:43.467 --> 10:46.734
CALL THEM HIS GRANDFATHER AND

10:46.800 --> 10:47.033
GRANDMOTHER.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.066
SO APPARENTLY HE WENT TO EUROPE,

10:48.133 --> 10:49.834
MET AN OLD LADY, ASKED HER TO BE

10:49.900 --> 10:51.367
HIS GRANDMOTHER, AND NOW HE

10:51.433 --> 10:55.734
KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE MONARCHY.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.767
AND IF THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,

10:56.834 --> 10:59.767
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY THE

10:59.834 --> 11:00.567
EXACT BACKSTORY OF

11:00.633 --> 11:03.467
BABAR THE ELEPHANT.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.100
AND WHEN HE WAS PRESSED ON ALL

11:05.166 --> 11:06.266
THIS, HE GOT A LITTLE TESTY.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.266
>> I STOPPED LIVING IN NEW YORK

11:07.333 --> 11:07.834
WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENS.

11:07.900 --> 11:08.467
>> OKAY.

11:08.533 --> 11:09.066
>> AND THE WAY I SPEAK IS THE

11:09.133 --> 11:16.700
WAY I SPEAK.

11:16.767 --> 11:17.400
IT'S -- IT'S NATURAL TO ME.

11:17.467 --> 11:18.367
I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO.

11:18.433 --> 11:19.100
I'M KNOWLEDGEABLE IN MY SUBJECT

11:19.166 --> 11:20.333
AND ANYONE CAN GO UP AGAINST ME.

11:20.400 --> 11:20.934
I KNOW MORE ABOUT THE BRITISH

11:21.000 --> 11:21.533
MONARCHY THAN MOST PEOPLE IN

11:21.600 --> 11:22.300
BRITAIN.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.266
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:24.333 --> 11:27.066
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE TRUE,

11:27.133 --> 11:28.800
AND THAT SHOULD'VE TIPPED

11:28.867 --> 11:29.834
EVERYONE OFF THE WHOLE TIME.

11:29.900 --> 11:30.533
MOST BRITISH PEOPLE DON'T REALLY

11:30.600 --> 11:32.667
CARE EITHER WAY ABOUT THE

11:32.734 --> 11:35.667
MONARCHY.

11:35.734 --> 11:36.233
THAT MAKES HIM CLEARLY AN

11:36.300 --> 11:36.867
IMPOSTOR.

11:36.934 --> 11:37.567
BUT THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS

11:37.633 --> 11:38.266
THAT PRETENDING TO BE BRITISH BY

11:38.333 --> 11:39.300
BECOMING A ROYAL EXPERT IS SO

11:39.367 --> 11:42.266
LAZY.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.000
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO PULL

11:44.066 --> 11:44.800
THE WOOL OVER PEOPLE'S EYES,

11:44.867 --> 11:45.900
GET A SPOT ON "THE DAILY SHOW,"

11:45.967 --> 11:46.834
BIDE YOUR TIME, PERFECT YOUR

11:46.900 --> 11:47.867
FAKE ACCENT, AND EVENTUALLY LAND

11:47.934 --> 11:49.700
YOUR OWN WEEKLY PROGRAM ON HBO.

11:49.767 --> 11:50.967
OH, HAVE I SAID TOO MUCH?

11:51.033 --> 11:52.734
HAVE I SAID TOO MUCH?

11:52.800 --> 11:58.567
AND NOW THIS.

11:58.633 --> 12:01.100
>> Announcer: AND NOW, THE

12:01.166 --> 12:01.633
VERY BRITISH PUT-DOWNS OF

12:01.700 --> 12:04.800
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

12:04.867 --> 12:05.734
JOHN BERCOW.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.934
>> ORDER!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.266
ORDER!

12:12.333 --> 12:14.500
A BELLY OF EMOTIONAL CONDITION.

12:14.567 --> 12:14.667
>>

12:14.734 --> 12:16.900
LET ME SAY TO THE HONORABLE

12:16.967 --> 12:17.834
GENTLEMEN I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG

12:17.900 --> 12:19.333
TIME, I THINK WHEN HE COMES TO

12:19.400 --> 12:20.567
REFLECT ON HIS CONDUCT, YOU'LL

12:20.633 --> 12:22.867
KNOW HE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

12:22.934 --> 12:25.934
THOSE PRATING AWAY SHOULD CEASE

12:26.000 --> 12:27.300
DOING SO.

12:27.367 --> 12:28.166
IT'S STUPID AND

12:28.233 --> 12:29.300
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

12:29.367 --> 12:29.934
BOTH SIDES ARE STILL SHOUTING

12:30.000 --> 12:32.700
THEIR HEADS OFF.

12:32.767 --> 12:33.433
IT'S VERY DOWN-MARKET.

12:33.500 --> 12:38.900
IT'S A VERY LOW GRADE.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.500
YOU ARE A VERY SEXUALLY

12:40.567 --> 12:43.100
BOISTEROUS FELLOW, SORT OF DUMB.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.734
YOU MAY BE A CHEEKY CHAPPIE BUT

12:45.800 --> 12:47.100
ALSO EXCEPTIONALLY NOISY.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.133
YOU WERE MUCH BETTER BEHAVED

12:49.200 --> 12:50.333
WHEN YOU ARE AT

12:50.400 --> 12:50.734
OXFORD UNIVERSITY.

12:50.800 --> 12:51.133
CALM YOURSELF.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.333
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SENIOR

12:53.400 --> 12:53.767
STATESMAN.

12:53.834 --> 12:54.700
CALM YOURSELF, MAN.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.500
GET A GRIP OF YOURSELF, MAN.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.533
I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TAKE SOME

13:00.600 --> 13:01.333
SORT OF SOOTHING PREDICAMENT, GO

13:01.400 --> 13:02.500
LIE DOWN.

13:02.567 --> 13:03.133
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.200
LET ME GENTLY SAY TO THE

13:06.266 --> 13:08.200
ASSIDUOUS BUT SLIGHTLY

13:08.266 --> 13:09.800
OVERENTHUSIASTIC GENTLEMEN THAT

WANT RECOGNITION FOR THEIR

14:04.033 --> 14:06.667
CRIMES.

14:06.734 --> 14:08.000
NOW, WE CURRENTLY HAVE A LOT OF

14:08.066 --> 14:08.934
SENIOR CITIZENS -- RIGHT NOW,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.333
OVER 49 MILLION AMERICANS ARE 65

14:10.400 --> 14:12.033
AND OLDER -- AND THAT NUMBER IS

14:12.100 --> 14:13.567
EXPECTED TO SHARPLY INCREASE IN

14:13.633 --> 14:15.834
A DEMOGRAPHIC SURGE SOME HAVE

14:15.900 --> 14:17.133
CALLED THE "SILVER TSUNAMI,"

14:17.200 --> 14:18.500
WHICH IS ALSO THE NICKNAME

14:18.567 --> 14:19.233
CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER GOES BY AT

14:19.300 --> 14:20.834
HIS UNDERGROUND CAGEFIGHTING

14:20.900 --> 14:21.934
RING.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.300
HE'S 57-0.

14:24.367 --> 14:26.467
IF YOU GET CAUGHT IN THE

14:26.533 --> 14:28.533
SILVER TSUNAMI'S FLURRY OF

14:28.600 --> 14:29.133
FISTS, YOU'RE WAKING UP IN THE

14:29.200 --> 14:29.800
HOSPITAL.

14:29.867 --> 14:30.533
BUT THE TRUTH IS, NOT EVERYONE

14:30.600 --> 14:31.567
IS GOING TO REMAIN AS SHARP AND

14:31.633 --> 14:32.700
SELF-SUFFICIENT IN THEIR OLD AGE

14:32.767 --> 14:33.700
AS THAT MURDERER LAUGHING AT HER

14:33.767 --> 14:35.367
DEAD DOCTORS.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.066
UNAVOIDABLY, SOME OF US ARE

14:37.133 --> 14:38.567
GOING TO WIND UP NEEDING EXTRA

14:38.633 --> 14:40.333
CARE, AND THAT COULD PLACE US IN

14:40.400 --> 14:42.433
A SYSTEM CALLED GUARDIANSHIP.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.367
I'LL LET A MARYLAND JUDGE

14:43.433 --> 14:44.800
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU AS A CAMERA

14:44.867 --> 14:45.867
PUSHES RELENTLESSLY INTO HIS

14:45.934 --> 14:47.367
FACE.

14:47.433 --> 14:48.800
>> A GUARDIAN IS SOMEONE

14:48.867 --> 14:50.166
APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO ACT ON

14:50.233 --> 14:52.133
BEHALF OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

14:52.200 --> 14:53.667
UNDER A MENTAL OR PHYSICAL

14:53.734 --> 14:55.500
DISABILITY AND AS A RESULT, IS

14:55.567 --> 14:57.934
UNABLE TO MAKE RESPONSIBLE

14:58.000 --> 14:59.867
DECISIONS ABOUT HIS OR HER CARE

14:59.934 --> 15:03.800
OR PROPERTY.

15:03.867 --> 15:06.967
>> John: HE'S RIGHT.

15:07.033 --> 15:10.000
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW,

15:10.066 --> 15:11.467
THAT ZOOM WASN'T PLANNED.

15:11.533 --> 15:12.100
THE CAMERAMAN WAS JUST SO TAKEN

15:12.166 --> 15:12.734
BY THE JUDGE'S ANIMAL MAGNETISM,

15:12.800 --> 15:13.400
HE COULDN'T RESIST MOVING IN

15:13.467 --> 15:14.200
CLOSER AND CLOSER.

15:14.266 --> 15:15.300
THE FINAL SHOT WAS JUST THE

15:15.367 --> 15:16.033
CAMERA PRESSED UP AGAINST HIS

15:16.100 --> 15:16.934
MUSTACHE.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.834
AND THE FACT IS, GUARDIANSHIP IS

15:17.900 --> 15:25.834
AN IMPORTANT, VALUABLE TOOL.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.133
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS BASICALLY.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.567
LET'S SAY AN ELDERLY PERSON WHO

15:30.633 --> 15:31.200
LIVES ALONE IS SHOWING SIGNS OF

15:31.266 --> 15:32.100
DEMENTIA.

15:32.166 --> 15:32.667
ANY CONCERNED PERSON COULD

15:32.734 --> 15:33.266
PETITION A COURT, WHICH MIGHT

15:33.333 --> 15:33.900
DECIDE TO APPOINT A GUARDIAN, TO

15:33.967 --> 15:34.400
HELP THEM MAKE IMPORTANT

15:34.467 --> 15:35.033
DECISIONS.

15:35.100 --> 15:35.667
THAT GUARDIAN COULD BE A FAMILY

15:35.734 --> 15:36.300
MEMBER OR, IF THERE IS NO FAMILY

15:36.367 --> 15:37.066
OR IF THE FAMILY'S FIGHTING, THE

15:37.133 --> 15:37.667
COURT MIGHT APPOINT A PRIVATE

15:37.734 --> 15:38.633
GUARDIAN -- A PROFESSIONAL WHO'S

15:38.700 --> 15:45.567
PAID TO MANAGE THEIR AFFAIRS.

15:45.633 --> 15:48.166
AND WHEN THE SYSTEM WORKS,

15:48.233 --> 15:48.800
IT'S GREAT.

15:48.867 --> 15:49.500
BUT IT PROBABLY WON'T SURPRISE

15:49.567 --> 15:50.133
YOU: THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS STORY

15:50.200 --> 15:53.500
IS ABOUT.

15:53.567 --> 15:54.934
THAT'S JUST NOT WHAT WE DO ON

15:55.000 --> 15:55.633
"I JUST WANTED TO WATCH A COMEDY

15:55.700 --> 15:56.900
SHOW AND GO TO SLEEP BUT NOW I'M

15:56.967 --> 15:57.467
SAD WITH JOHNNY JOY-KILLER."

15:57.533 --> 15:58.533
BECAUSE LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT CAN

15:58.600 --> 15:59.900
HAPPEN WHEN GUARDIANSHIP GOES

15:59.967 --> 16:00.700
WRONG.

16:00.767 --> 16:01.600
TAKE THE CASE OF RUDY AND RENNIE

16:01.667 --> 16:02.734
NORTH.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.567
THEY WERE LIVING TOGETHER

16:04.633 --> 16:05.633
HAPPILY IN LAS VEGAS WHEN ONE

16:05.700 --> 16:07.033
DAY, THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE

16:07.100 --> 16:07.266
DOOR.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.500
AND I'LL LET RUDY TAKE IT FROM

16:09.567 --> 16:10.834
HERE.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.600
>> SO I OPEN THE DOOR AND THEY

16:12.667 --> 16:14.500
SAID THAT THEY WERE OFFICERS OF

16:14.567 --> 16:16.767
THE COURT.

16:16.834 --> 16:18.367
>> RUDY SAYS THE OFFICERS GAVE

16:18.433 --> 16:19.300
THE COUPLE THREE OPTIONS.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.166
>> ONE, WE CALL THE POLICE.

16:21.233 --> 16:24.533
TWO, WE HAVE YOU GO TO A

16:24.600 --> 16:27.633
PSYCHIATRIC WARD.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.000
>> CHOICE THREE?

16:29.066 --> 16:34.066
AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.967
>> John: WELL, THAT IS THREE

16:37.033 --> 16:37.633
TERRIBLE OPTIONS THERE.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.133
IT'S LIKE PLAYING

16:39.200 --> 16:43.867
"FUCK-MARRY-KILL"

16:43.934 --> 16:44.800
WITH THE CHIPMUNKS.

16:44.867 --> 16:45.367
NONE OF THEM!

16:45.433 --> 16:46.033
NONE OF THAT!

16:46.100 --> 16:46.967
I'LL KILL MYSELF!

16:47.033 --> 16:47.967
BUT IT'S TRUE: THERE WAS A KNOCK

16:48.033 --> 16:48.967
ON THE NORTHS' DOOR, AND THEY

16:49.033 --> 16:49.500
WERE SUDDENLY MOVED TO A

16:49.567 --> 16:50.233
FACILITY BY A WOMAN THEY'D NEVER

16:50.300 --> 16:51.100
MET BEFORE WHO WAS GIVEN CONTROL

16:51.166 --> 16:52.266
OF THEM BY A JUDGE WHO THEY'D

16:52.333 --> 16:52.767
ALSO NEVER MET.

16:52.834 --> 16:53.767
AND BY THE TIME THEY GOT OUT

16:53.834 --> 16:55.600
FROM UNDER THAT GUARDIAN'S

16:55.667 --> 16:56.934
CONTROL TWO YEARS LATER, MOST

16:57.000 --> 16:58.033
OF THEIR MONEY WAS GONE,

16:58.100 --> 16:59.600
SOMETHING THAT RUDY IS STILL

16:59.667 --> 17:01.934
UNDERSTANDABLY FURIOUS ABOUT.

17:02.000 --> 17:02.967
>> THEY'RE STRIPPERS.

17:03.033 --> 17:04.600
THEY STRIP YOUR CLOTHES.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.900
THEY STRIP EVERYTHING FROM YOU.

17:06.967 --> 17:09.166
WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

17:09.233 --> 17:10.967
NO MONEY, NO ASSETS, NOTHING.

17:11.033 --> 17:17.300
NOTHING LEFT.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.667
>> John: AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I

17:18.734 --> 17:19.734
REALLY FEEL FOR HIM.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.834
ALTHOUGH I MUST DEFEND STRIPPERS

17:20.900 --> 17:21.834
THERE.

17:21.900 --> 17:22.934
THEY GET RID OF THEIR OWN

17:23.000 --> 17:23.867
CLOTHES, NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S.

17:23.934 --> 17:24.934
BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO WALKS AROUND

17:25.000 --> 17:25.533
GETTING RID OF OTHER PEOPLE'S

17:25.600 --> 17:26.333
CLOTHES IS EITHER A CRIMINAL OR

17:26.400 --> 17:26.934
TAN FRANCE FROM THE REBOOT OF

17:27.000 --> 17:34.200
"QUEER EYE."

17:34.266 --> 17:34.867
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR

17:34.934 --> 17:35.533
SYSTEM OF GUARDIANSHIP.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.200
AND THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD

17:36.266 --> 17:36.867
KNOW IS THAT FAR MORE PEOPLE ARE

17:36.934 --> 17:37.734
UNDER IT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.033
ONE STUDY ESTIMATED THE FIGURE

17:39.100 --> 17:40.367
AROUND 1.3 MILLION PEOPLE.

17:40.433 --> 17:41.266
AND THE NEXT THING YOU SHOULD

17:41.333 --> 17:42.967
KNOW IS THAT GUARDIANS CAN HAVE

17:43.033 --> 17:44.567
A HUGE AMOUNT OF POWER OVER

17:44.633 --> 17:46.333
PEOPLE UNDER THEIR CARE, OR

17:46.400 --> 17:48.433
THEIR WARDS.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.767
BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE TO MAKE

17:50.834 --> 17:51.800
FINANCIAL AND HEALTH DECISIONS,

17:51.867 --> 17:52.667
THEY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO

17:52.734 --> 17:53.500
EVERYTHING FROM WARDS' BANK

17:53.567 --> 17:54.367
ACCOUNTS TO THEIR HEALTH

17:54.433 --> 17:58.967
RECORDS.

17:59.033 --> 18:00.333
AND AS FOR THE WARDS THEMSELVES,

18:00.400 --> 18:01.667
THEY CAN LOSE A LOT OF THEIR

18:01.734 --> 18:03.233
RIGHTS, FROM BEING ABLE TO VOTE

18:03.300 --> 18:03.834
IN ELECTIONS TO BEING ABLE TO

18:03.900 --> 18:04.367
GET MARRIED.

18:04.433 --> 18:05.066
SO IT'S NO SMALL THING, AS ONE

18:05.133 --> 18:06.467
JUDGE WHO AWARDS GUARDIANSHIPS

18:06.533 --> 18:06.834
WILL TELL YOU.

18:06.900 --> 18:07.934
>> GUARDIANSHIP IS A MASSIVE

18:08.000 --> 18:09.567
INTRUSION INTO A PERSON'S LIFE.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.834
>> THEY LOSE A LOT OF RIGHTS.

18:11.900 --> 18:12.734
>> IN FACT, THEY LOSE MORE

18:12.800 --> 18:13.800
RIGHTS THAN SOMEONE WHO GOES TO

18:13.867 --> 18:15.633
PRISON.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.667
>> John: LESS RIGHTS THAN

18:16.734 --> 18:17.767
SOMEONE IN PRISON.

18:17.834 --> 18:21.633
THAT IS PRETTY SHOCKING.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.066
BASICALLY THE ONLY THINGS THAT

18:24.133 --> 18:25.500
YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IN

18:25.567 --> 18:27.300
PRISON ARE SLEEP, EAT, WORK OUT,

18:27.367 --> 18:27.967
AND OCCASIONALLY PLAY BACKGAMMON

18:28.033 --> 18:28.367
WITH PHIL SPECTOR.

18:28.433 --> 18:29.066
HE'S REALLY GOOD AT IT.

18:29.133 --> 18:33.266
IT'S ALL HE DOES NOW.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.467
HE IS FINISHED WITH THE KILLING.

18:35.533 --> 18:41.166
THAT WAS JUST A PHASE FOR PHIL.

18:41.233 --> 18:42.200
AND THE FACT THAT GUARDIANS GAIN

18:42.266 --> 18:42.834
CONTROL OF THEIR WARDS' FINANCES

18:42.900 --> 18:43.333
IS WHERE THINGS CAN GET

18:43.400 --> 18:43.900
PROBLEMATIC, BECAUSE PRIVATE

18:43.967 --> 18:44.467
GUARDIANS CAN BILL FOR EACH

18:44.533 --> 18:45.333
INDIVIDUAL SERVICE THEY PROVIDE,

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
FROM LEAVING VOICE MESSAGES TO

18:46.467 --> 18:47.967
OPENING THE MAIL, AND TAKE

18:48.033 --> 18:49.400
PAYMENT DIRECTLY OUT OF THEIR

18:49.467 --> 18:54.100
WARDS' ESTATE, AND THOSE CHARGES

18:54.166 --> 18:57.500
CAN ACCUMULATE FAST

18:57.567 --> 19:00.200
AND SOMETIMES SEEM AS

19:00.266 --> 19:02.233
RIDICULOUS.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.700
MARIE LONG DISCOVERED WHEN THEY

19:04.767 --> 19:05.834
LOOKED INTO SOME

19:05.900 --> 19:06.467
CHARGES SURROUNDING AN EXPENSIVE

19:06.533 --> 19:07.000
OUTING.

19:07.066 --> 19:07.667
>> JUST LOOK AT WHAT SUN VALLEY

19:07.734 --> 19:08.333
CHARGED MARIE TO SEND HER AND

19:08.400 --> 19:09.200
THEIR WORKER TO A PHOENIX SUNS

19:09.266 --> 19:09.834
BASKETBALL GAME.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.000
OVER $1,000 FOR RESEARCH, PHONE

19:11.066 --> 19:11.467
CALLS, A LIMO.

19:11.533 --> 19:12.734
SUN VALLEY EVEN CHARGED MARIE

19:12.800 --> 19:14.133
$228 TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF

19:14.200 --> 19:20.533
THE GAME ON HER MOOD.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.367
>> John: EXACTLY, THEY CHARGED

19:22.433 --> 19:23.800
HER $228 TO FIGURE OUT HOW A

19:23.867 --> 19:29.367
PHOENIX SUNS GAME AFFECTED HER

19:29.433 --> 19:30.367
MOOD, WHICH IS ABSURD.

19:30.433 --> 19:31.000
I'LL TELL YOU THAT FOR FREE: IT

19:31.066 --> 19:34.333
WAS A PHOENIX SUNS GAME.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.633
IT MADE HER SAD.

19:35.700 --> 19:36.166
TRY IT.

19:36.233 --> 19:36.967
GO TO A GAME AND SEE IF IT

19:37.033 --> 19:37.633
IMPROVES YOUR MOOD TO SEE DRAGAN

19:37.700 --> 19:39.000
BENDER PUT UP 4 POINTS AND 1.5

19:39.066 --> 19:41.667
REBOUNDS.

19:41.734 --> 19:42.233
SPOILER ALERT.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.133
IT WON'T.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.800
AND WHEN RUDY AND RENNIE'S

19:45.867 --> 19:48.200
GUARDIAN, A WOMAN NAMED

19:48.266 --> 19:48.900
APRIL PARKS, WAS CONFRONTED OVER

19:48.967 --> 19:49.533
SOME OF WHAT SHE'D CHARGED THEM

19:49.600 --> 19:50.767
FOR, SHE DIDN'T EXACTLY STAND

19:50.834 --> 19:51.066
HER GROUND.

19:51.133 --> 19:51.900
>> RUDY AND RENNIE WERE CHARGED

19:51.967 --> 19:52.667
$780 EACH FOR COURT FILINGS AND

19:52.734 --> 19:53.567
TRAVEL TIME TO COURT ON THE SAME

19:53.633 --> 19:57.600
DAYS IN 2013.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.867
THAT'S OVER $1500 TO THIS

19:58.934 --> 20:00.266
COUPLE.

20:00.333 --> 20:00.967
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.400
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

20:02.467 --> 20:03.266
>> WHO YOU'RE SAYING DOESN'T

20:03.333 --> 20:04.133
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY ALREADY.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.200
>> WE -- WE WILL HAPPILY REVERSE

20:06.266 --> 20:09.300
THOSE CHARGES OUT.

20:09.367 --> 20:10.900
>> HOW ABOUT $108 PARKS CHARGED

20:10.967 --> 20:12.633
RENNIE TO BUY HER A PAIR OF

20:12.700 --> 20:14.700
STRETCH PANTS?

20:14.767 --> 20:15.867
>> DOES $108 FOR STRETCH PANTS

20:15.934 --> 20:16.266
SOUND REASONABLE?

20:16.333 --> 20:16.900
>> NO, IT DOESN'T, AND I'M HAPPY

20:16.967 --> 20:20.200
TO REVERSE THAT.

20:20.266 --> 20:21.700
>> John: YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T

20:21.767 --> 20:22.934
JUST DO A BUNCH OF SHITTY THINGS

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
AND THEN SAY "I'LL REVERSE IT."

20:24.066 --> 20:25.667
THIS IS SOMEONE'S LIFE, NOT A

20:25.734 --> 20:26.700
FUCKING MISSY ELLIOT SONG.

20:26.767 --> 20:31.033
ALTHOUGH, IN FAIRNESS, YOU

20:31.100 --> 20:32.000
DO PROBABLY NEED GOOD STRETCH

20:32.066 --> 20:32.900
PANTS IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT

20:32.967 --> 20:33.800
YOUR THING DOWN, FLIP IT, AND

20:33.867 --> 20:35.333
REVERSE IT.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.934
AND THE NORTHS WEREN'T THE ONLY

20:37.000 --> 20:37.867
ONES WHO HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT

20:37.934 --> 20:39.800
APRIL PARKS' BILLING PRACTICES.

20:39.867 --> 20:41.600
SHE HAD UP TO 100 WARDS AT A

20:41.667 --> 20:43.133
SINGLE TIME, AND IN A COURT CASE

20:43.200 --> 20:45.767
INVOLVING A DIFFERENT WARD, A

20:45.834 --> 20:47.200
CURIOUS FACT EMERGED.

20:47.266 --> 20:48.633
>> PARKS WAS A NO-SHOW IN COURT,

20:48.700 --> 20:50.266
BUT HER VOICE WAS HEARD THROUGH

20:50.333 --> 20:52.100
HER OWN FINANCIAL RECORDS, WHICH

20:52.166 --> 20:53.567
ARE ALMOST LAUGHABLE.

20:53.633 --> 20:54.667
>> SOME DAYS WERE OVER A HUNDRED

20:54.734 --> 20:55.600
HOURS OF BILLING.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.467
THAT'S NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE.

20:57.533 --> 20:58.700
>> John: YEAH, 100 HOURS A DAY

20:58.767 --> 21:00.300
IS NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE

21:00.367 --> 21:01.834
UNLESS SHE WAS WORKING ON THE

21:01.900 --> 21:02.967
PLANET MERCURY, WHERE, AS WE ALL

21:03.033 --> 21:04.900
KNOW, EACH DAY LASTS 1,407 EARTH

21:04.967 --> 21:06.467
HOURS.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.800
I'LL BE HONEST, THAT'S A JOKE

21:07.867 --> 21:09.767
EXCLUSIVELY DESIGNED FOR

21:09.834 --> 21:12.734
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.867
SO I DO HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT,

21:13.934 --> 21:14.767
DR. TYSON, BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY

21:14.834 --> 21:18.900
NOBODY ELSE DID.

21:18.967 --> 21:19.533
ACTUALLY, OUT OF INTEREST, DID

21:19.600 --> 21:20.567
YOU ENJOY IT?

21:20.633 --> 21:21.166
>> YEAH, BUT THE TIME YOU GAVE

21:21.233 --> 21:21.800
WAS THE ROTATION RATE OF

21:21.867 --> 21:22.967
MERCURY.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.433
THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS A

21:24.500 --> 21:26.033
DAY.

21:26.100 --> 21:26.934
A DAY ON MERCURY WOULD BE FROM

21:27.000 --> 21:28.400
SUNRISE TO SUNRISE, OF COURSE.

21:28.467 --> 21:30.200
AND ON MERCURY, THAT LASTS THREE

21:30.266 --> 21:31.033
TIMES LONGER THAN WHAT YOU JUST

21:31.100 --> 21:32.867
GAVE.

21:32.934 --> 21:36.000
>> John: SHUT UP, NEIL!

21:36.066 --> 21:36.700
SHUT UP!

21:36.767 --> 21:37.467
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO RUIN

21:37.533 --> 21:38.300
EVERYTHING?

21:38.367 --> 21:40.600
JUST ENJOY SOMETHING FOR ONCE IN

21:40.667 --> 21:41.233
YOUR FUCKING LIFE!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.000
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

21:42.066 --> 21:44.767
YOU FECKLESS --

21:44.834 --> 21:47.900
OH, NEVER MIND.

21:47.967 --> 21:49.767
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

21:49.834 --> 21:50.600
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.266
BAD IDEA.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.000
AND APRIL PARKS' CAVALIER

21:53.066 --> 21:54.166
APPROACH TO HER WARDS CONTINUED

21:54.233 --> 21:56.033
EVEN AFTER SOME OF THEM DIED,

21:56.100 --> 22:00.433
BECAUSE WHEN THIS GUY,

22:00.500 --> 22:01.266
THIS GUY HERE, BOUGHT A

22:01.333 --> 22:02.200
STORAGE UNIT AT AUCTION, YOU'LL

22:02.266 --> 22:03.066
NEVER GUESS WHAT HE FOUND.

22:03.133 --> 22:03.900
>> 27 URNS.

22:03.967 --> 22:04.767
27 SETS OF DIFFERENT ASHES.

22:04.834 --> 22:05.900
SOME A FEW YEARS OLD, OTHERS

22:05.967 --> 22:07.233
FROM THE EARLY 2000s.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.000
>> SOMEBODY HAD THE GALL TO

22:09.066 --> 22:11.100
STORE A FAMILY MEMBER IN A

22:11.166 --> 22:12.767
STORAGE UNIT LIKE THAT.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.433
>> THAT SOMEBODY, ACCORDING TO

22:14.500 --> 22:15.867
VALLEY FUNERAL HOME DIRECTORS,

22:15.934 --> 22:18.200
WAS THIS WOMAN, APRIL PARKS.

22:18.266 --> 22:19.700
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

22:19.767 --> 22:22.266
SHE JUST LEFT URNS FULL OF

22:22.333 --> 22:23.166
OTHER PEOPLE'S FAMILY MEMBERS

22:23.233 --> 22:24.333
IN A STORAGE UNIT.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.633
AND THE ONLY WAY THAT COULD'VE

22:25.700 --> 22:26.433
BEEN IN WORSE TASTE WAS IF SHE'D

22:26.500 --> 22:27.633
POURED THEM INTO A PINATA FOR A

22:27.700 --> 22:29.600
9-YEAR-OLD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

22:29.667 --> 22:30.934
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MATTHEW.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.133
NINE'S A FUN AGE."

22:34.200 --> 22:35.500
NOW, NOW, PARKS WAS EVENTUALLY

22:35.567 --> 22:37.200
ARRESTED -- NOT FOR THE URN

22:37.266 --> 22:39.400
THING, BY THE WAY, WHICH WAS

22:39.467 --> 22:41.033
COMPLETELY LEGAL -- AND SHE'S

22:41.100 --> 22:42.600
CURRENTLY FACING TRIAL ON OVER

22:42.667 --> 22:43.667
200 FELONY CHARGES INCLUDING

22:43.734 --> 22:44.900
RACKETEERING, THEFT,

22:44.967 --> 22:45.934
EXPLOITATION, AND PERJURY.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.600
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING,

22:47.667 --> 22:48.633
WELL, HOW DID SHE EVEN GET SO

22:48.700 --> 22:50.300
MANY WARDS IN THE FIRST PLACE?

22:50.367 --> 22:51.900
WHY DIDN'T THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF

22:51.967 --> 22:53.033
GUARDIAN OVERSIGHT STEP IN TO

22:53.100 --> 22:54.300
STOP HER?

22:54.367 --> 22:55.567
WELL, THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE THAT

22:55.633 --> 22:56.734
AGENCY DOESN'T EXIST.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.100
WE JUST MADE IT UP.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.100
AND THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE

22:59.166 --> 23:00.300
SYMBOLS ON THAT LOGO WAS JUST

23:00.367 --> 23:01.433
HARVEY KEITEL'S FACE SHOULD'VE

23:01.500 --> 23:11.633
BEEN A GIVEAWAY.

23:11.700 --> 23:14.633
THE FACT IS, GUARDIANSHIP IS THE

23:14.700 --> 23:15.667
RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE AND

23:15.734 --> 23:16.000
LOCAL COURTS.

23:16.066 --> 23:18.967
MEANING THAT IN MOST PLACES,

23:19.033 --> 23:20.166
EVERYTHING ABOUT GUARDIANSHIP --

23:20.233 --> 23:21.033
FROM WHO BECOMES ONE, TO WHO

23:21.100 --> 23:22.133
THEY OVERSEE, TO WHAT THEY CAN

23:22.200 --> 23:22.700
CHARGE -- IS ADMINISTERED BY

23:22.767 --> 23:23.333
LOCAL JUDGES, WHO MAY BE ELECTED

23:23.400 --> 23:24.233
AND MAY HAVE NO LEGAL TRAINING.

23:24.300 --> 23:25.066
FOR INSTANCE, IN MUCH OF TEXAS,

23:25.133 --> 23:25.967
GUARDIANSHIP DECISIONS ARE MADE

23:26.033 --> 23:26.867
BY COUNTY JUDGES, AND ONLY 29 OF

23:26.934 --> 23:27.700
THE JUDGES IN THOSE 211 COUNTIES

23:27.767 --> 23:30.567
ARE LAWYERS.

23:30.633 --> 23:31.867
THE REST, AS ONE JUDGE PUT IT,

23:31.934 --> 23:33.000
ARE FARMERS, CAR DEALERS, AND

23:33.066 --> 23:34.266
INSURANCE SALESMEN.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.433
AND THOSE COURTS CAN BE SO

23:35.500 --> 23:37.033
OVERWORKED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

23:37.100 --> 23:38.000
THE RESOURCES TO MONITOR CASES

23:38.066 --> 23:41.533
PROPERLY.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.400
WHEN TEXAS RECENTLY AUDITED

23:43.467 --> 23:47.066
THEIR GUARDIANSHIPS, THEY FOUND

23:47.133 --> 23:47.934
THAT OVER 3,000 WARDS HAD DIED

23:48.000 --> 23:49.100
WITHOUT THE COURT KNOWING.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.600
AND "ARE THEY ALIVE OR DEAD?" IS

23:50.667 --> 23:52.467
THE ABSOLUTE LEAST YOU SHOULD

23:52.533 --> 23:53.934
KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE UNDER YOUR

23:54.000 --> 23:54.900
CARE.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.467
IF A ZOOKEEPER DIDN'T KNOW THAT

23:56.533 --> 23:57.333
3,000 OF HIS ANIMALS WERE DEAD,

23:57.400 --> 24:07.133
YOU'D PUT SOMEONE ELSE IN CHARGE

24:07.200 --> 24:09.767
OF THAT FUCKING ZOO OR REBRAND

24:09.834 --> 24:10.567
IT AS AN "OPEN-AIR EXOTIC MEAT

24:10.633 --> 24:11.900
MARKET."

24:11.967 --> 24:12.800
AND ON TOP OF THIS, ONLY 12

24:12.867 --> 24:13.900
STATES REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL

24:13.967 --> 24:14.900
GUARDIANS TO BE CERTIFIED AT

24:14.967 --> 24:15.767
ALL, SO JUST ABOUT ANYONE CAN

24:15.834 --> 24:16.667
BECOME ONE.

24:16.734 --> 24:17.734
AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE LOOKED

24:18.867 --> 24:19.700
INTO THIS A FEW YEARS AGO, THEIR

24:19.767 --> 24:20.734
FINDINGS WERE TRULY TROUBLING.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.400
>> MOST JOBS HANDLING EVEN SMALL

24:22.467 --> 24:23.767
AMOUNTS OF CASH REQUIRE SOME

24:23.834 --> 24:25.000
SORT OF CRIMINAL BACKGROUND

24:25.066 --> 24:26.767
CHECK AND OR A CREDIT CHECK, BUT

24:26.834 --> 24:30.667
THE GAO FOUND IN MOST CASES

24:30.734 --> 24:31.700
GUARDIANS FOR THE ELDERLY CAN

24:31.767 --> 24:32.700
HANDLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND

24:32.767 --> 24:34.133
STATES HAVE FAILED TO REQUIRE

24:34.200 --> 24:36.800
EITHER.

24:36.867 --> 24:37.800
>> AND IT'S LIKE PUTTING THE,

24:37.867 --> 24:39.767
YOU KNOW, FOX IN THE CHICKEN

24:39.834 --> 24:40.800
COOP BASICALLY, AND OF COURSE,

24:40.867 --> 24:45.300
THEY'RE GOING TO STEAL MONEY.

24:45.367 --> 24:45.934
>> John: EXACTLY.

24:46.000 --> 24:46.734
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, NOT EVERY

24:46.800 --> 24:47.633
FOX IS OUT TO STEAL FROM YOU.

24:47.700 --> 24:48.667
THAT'S A STEREOTYPE BASED ON

24:48.734 --> 24:49.600
SWIPER FROM "DORA THE EXPLORER."

24:49.667 --> 24:50.967
IT IS NOT ALL FOXES.

24:51.033 --> 24:55.200
#NotAllFoxes.

24:55.266 --> 25:00.333
ACTUALLY, NOW I'M LOOKING AT

25:00.400 --> 25:01.033
THIS, THAT ALSO SAYS

25:01.100 --> 25:02.000
"NO TALL FOXES."

25:02.066 --> 25:02.700
BUT I DO AGREE WITH THAT TOO.

25:02.767 --> 25:03.967
A TALL FOX WOULD BE VERY SCARY,

25:04.033 --> 25:04.600
AND AWARENESS MUST BE RAISED.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.834
#NoTallFoxes.

25:06.900 --> 25:07.867
AND ALL OF THIS LACK OF

25:07.934 --> 25:09.600
OVERSIGHT IS WORRYING IN A

25:09.667 --> 25:11.433
SYSTEM THAT CAN BE EASY TO FALL

25:11.500 --> 25:12.367
INTO AND VERY DIFFICULT TO GET

25:12.433 --> 25:13.633
OUT OF.

25:13.700 --> 25:14.867
REMEMBER, IT TOOK RUDY AND

25:14.934 --> 25:16.867
RENNIE NEARLY TWO YEARS TO GET

25:16.934 --> 25:18.033
OUT FROM UNDER APRIL PARKS, AND

25:18.100 --> 25:19.734
IT WASN'T EASY.

25:19.800 --> 25:20.734
ALTHOUGH LUCKILY FOR THEM, RUDY

25:20.800 --> 25:22.567
WAS PRETTY DETERMINED.

25:22.633 --> 25:24.500
>> WE'RE GOING TO PURSUE IT ALL

25:24.567 --> 25:25.600
THE WAY AND WE'RE GOING FOR

25:25.667 --> 25:27.200
THEIR BALLS.

25:27.266 --> 25:28.667
JUST SO THEY KNOW.

25:28.734 --> 25:36.266
IT'S THEIR BALLS WE WANT.

25:36.333 --> 25:36.834
>> John: OKAY, OKAY, THAT'S

25:36.900 --> 25:37.767
FINE.

25:37.834 --> 25:41.600
RUDY SEEMS DETERMINED.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.066
AND HE ALSO SEEMS LIKE THE FIRST

25:43.133 --> 25:44.200
PERSON IN HUMAN HISTORY ACTUALLY

25:44.266 --> 25:44.667
INTERESTED IN BALLS.

25:44.734 --> 25:45.533
GENERALLY, BALLS ARE TO THE BODY

25:45.600 --> 25:46.200
WHAT STARZ IS TO A CABLE

25:46.266 --> 25:47.133
PACKAGE.

25:47.200 --> 25:47.934
IT COMES WITH IT -- WE

25:48.000 --> 25:48.734
UNDERSTAND THAT -- BUT IT'S NOT

25:48.800 --> 25:49.633
NICE TO LOOK AT AND NOBODY

25:49.700 --> 25:51.934
REALLY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.800
AND AGAIN, I'M NOT SAYING THAT

25:54.867 --> 25:55.667
GUARDIANSHIP, AS A SYSTEM, IS

25:55.734 --> 25:57.033
INHERENTLY BAD.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.133
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT,

25:58.200 --> 25:59.500
AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE

25:59.567 --> 26:02.266
OF THEM AS THE SILVER TSUNAMI

26:02.333 --> 26:04.133
APPROACHES, BUT THAT'S ALL THE

26:04.200 --> 26:06.367
MORE REASON FOR US TO IMPROVE

26:06.433 --> 26:07.266
ITS CHECKS AND BALANCES, FROM

26:07.333 --> 26:08.400
GREATER REGULATION TO MORE

26:08.467 --> 26:09.567
FUNDING FOR OVERSIGHT.

26:09.633 --> 26:10.533
AND ON THE PERSONAL LEVEL, THERE

26:10.600 --> 26:11.567
ARE STEPS THAT EVERYONE CAN TAKE

26:11.633 --> 26:16.533
TO AVOID BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE

26:16.600 --> 26:17.133
OF IN THE FUTURE.

26:17.200 --> 26:17.800
MOST EXPERTS TELL US IT'S

26:17.867 --> 26:19.333
IMPORTANT TO HAVE HONEST

26:19.400 --> 26:22.333
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR

26:22.400 --> 26:26.100
FAMILY.

26:26.166 --> 26:27.567
I KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE A

26:27.633 --> 26:31.433
FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.633
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THESE

26:32.700 --> 26:33.900
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT YOU WANT TO

26:33.967 --> 26:35.834
YOU AND YOUR FINANCES TO BE

26:35.900 --> 26:37.533
CARED FOR SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.467
THAT'LL HELP PREVENT A COURT

26:38.533 --> 26:39.100
FROM STEPPING IN AND APPOINTING

26:39.166 --> 26:39.700
A PRIVATE GUARDIAN THAT COULD

26:39.767 --> 26:40.300
TURN OUT TO BE AN APRIL PARKS.

26:40.367 --> 26:40.900
PLUS, THERE ARE SOME CONCRETE

26:40.967 --> 26:41.600
LEGAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.533
