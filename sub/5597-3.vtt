WEBVTT

00:01.183 --> 00:02.466
Okay, ready? Let's try one more time.

00:02.468 --> 00:03.734
Ready? You can do it.

00:03.735 --> 00:07.738
There you go. One, two, three.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.875
- Ooh!
Charlie: - [laughs]

00:10.877 --> 00:13.977
Yeah, why walk when standing
there smiling is so much fun?

00:14.072 --> 00:15.236
Alex, we got to go.

00:15.356 --> 00:16.718
No, no, no, he's almost there.
We can't leave yet.

00:16.768 --> 00:18.882
- We don't have a choice.
- One more time. One more time.

00:18.967 --> 00:20.379
- No, I think we... what? What?
- We've got to go. We've got to go.

00:20.429 --> 00:21.257
We've got to go, got to go.

00:21.307 --> 00:23.518
- Ready? Go! Let's go.
- Aah! Well, okay. Wait.

00:23.521 --> 00:24.788
Don't walk until mommy comes home.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.422
- Back... back up, back up.
- What? What? We got to go.

00:26.424 --> 00:27.991
'Cause I didn't get to kiss him goodbye.

00:27.993 --> 00:29.626
I love you. Mwah!

00:29.628 --> 00:30.927
- I miss you already.
- Okay, bye, buddy.

00:30.929 --> 00:32.228
- Mwah.
- Bye-bye. Okay.

00:32.229 --> 00:33.762
Put some slippery socks on
him till Alex gets home.

00:33.764 --> 00:35.298
And jacket and, uh...

00:35.300 --> 00:36.899
Oh, and my file. There we go.

00:36.901 --> 00:38.301
All right, let's go.

00:38.303 --> 00:40.336
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Good all right, let's go.

00:40.338 --> 00:41.670
- Bye!
- Bye.

00:41.672 --> 00:44.407
- Call me if anything happens.
- Okay.

00:44.409 --> 00:46.976
[siren wailing]

00:46.978 --> 00:48.211
Dead eye, please.

00:48.213 --> 00:49.645
[keypad beeping]

00:49.647 --> 00:51.180
- May I ask?
- Hmm?

00:51.182 --> 00:52.515
What exactly is a dead eye?

00:52.517 --> 00:54.850
Well, it's coffee
with three shots of espresso.

00:54.852 --> 00:56.184
Seems a bit excessive.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.552
Well, the first two are standard.

00:57.554 --> 00:58.787
The third is to help me

00:58.789 --> 01:00.823
- with the mountain of paperwork ahead of me.
- Ah.

01:00.825 --> 01:02.891
Took me six months to
get my affairs in order

01:02.893 --> 01:04.693
- when I first transferred here.
- Any advice?

01:04.694 --> 01:07.429
Think of the salary
awaiting you in Cleveland.

01:07.431 --> 01:09.264
- Did I hear someone say Cleveland?
- Alex.

01:09.266 --> 01:10.666
You seem
in remarkably good spirits,

01:10.668 --> 01:12.935
considering we're about to lose
Dr. Lin to the midwest.

01:12.937 --> 01:14.903
I'm not losing you...

01:14.905 --> 01:17.805
Because I am going
to visit you as much as I can.

01:17.807 --> 01:19.273
- You are?
- Of course.

01:19.275 --> 01:21.509
Look at everything your city has to offer.

01:21.511 --> 01:23.911
You've got the rock and roll hall of fame,

01:23.913 --> 01:25.479
the world's largest rubber stamp.

01:25.481 --> 01:28.750
And if we feel like a road trip,
which I'm sure we will,

01:28.752 --> 01:31.986
- a giant building shaped like a basket.
- Mm-hmm.

01:31.988 --> 01:33.888
No, but seriously, you are embarking

01:33.890 --> 01:36.057
on an exciting, new,
well-paid chapter of your life,

01:36.059 --> 01:37.525
and I am gonna be there for you.

01:37.527 --> 01:38.692
Thank you.

01:38.694 --> 01:40.226
Everyone knows long distance doesn't work.

01:40.228 --> 01:41.762
[cellphones vibrating]

01:41.764 --> 01:43.930
- Who's this guy?
- Oh.

01:43.932 --> 01:46.332
[breathes deeply] Dr. Bell?

01:46.334 --> 01:47.801
- Yep.
- Great.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.003
Dawn: Okay, Lucille Ball once said,

01:50.005 --> 01:53.040
"if you want something done,
ask a busy person to do it."

01:53.042 --> 01:54.407
Apparently, she was wrong.

01:54.409 --> 01:57.044
The deadline for the
fellowship award application

01:57.046 --> 01:58.979
is today at 5:00.

01:58.981 --> 02:01.881
I don't care how busy you are. Get it in.

02:01.883 --> 02:06.386
This is a career-defining award
with a substantial cash prize.

02:06.388 --> 02:11.857
There. Now you all have one,
in case you have misplaced yours.

02:14.261 --> 02:17.197
I will see you all at the
donor dinner this evening.

02:18.799 --> 02:20.166
Now go. Heal.

02:20.168 --> 02:23.602
And beware the barrenness of a busy life.

02:23.604 --> 02:24.869
Socrates said that.

02:26.839 --> 02:28.507
You're very inspirational today.

02:28.509 --> 02:30.242
Daily quote calendar. It was a gift.

02:30.244 --> 02:31.976
From someone who doesn't know you very well.

02:33.079 --> 02:37.148
I was just wondering why you
paged me when I'm leaving.

02:37.150 --> 02:39.884
I need you to give a guided
tour to the junior residents.

02:39.886 --> 02:41.620
They keep getting lost on rounds.

02:41.622 --> 02:44.222
I have so much to do
before I leave for Ohio.

02:44.859 --> 02:46.290
Until then, you work for me.

02:46.292 --> 02:49.094
I believe the children are our future.

02:49.096 --> 02:51.596
That's quite a calendar.

02:51.598 --> 02:54.099
Actually, that one was all Whitney.

02:54.101 --> 02:56.300
Funny.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.969
Thought your application
would be in already.

02:57.971 --> 03:00.105
And I thought you were only
staying here for a year.

03:00.107 --> 03:02.040
I am, but with something
like this up for grabs,

03:02.042 --> 03:03.900
it would be ludicrous not to
throw my hat in the ring.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.487
- Right.
- Do you want to throw your hat in early?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.457
I have to give the junior residents a tour

03:08.507 --> 03:09.414
- of the hospital, and I...
- Uh, sorry.

03:09.464 --> 03:10.843
I think that was my phone.

03:10.893 --> 03:12.661
- I didn't hear anything.
- I did.

03:13.938 --> 03:15.919
You know, a year ago,
I would have had this application

03:15.921 --> 03:17.387
filled out in a second.

03:17.389 --> 03:18.889
Well, now you have other priorities.

03:18.891 --> 03:20.023
Like Luke walking.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.524
He's gonna walk today, Maggs. I can feel it.

03:21.526 --> 03:23.326
And I have to get through
this day as soon as possible

03:23.328 --> 03:24.494
so I don't miss it.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.495
Do you need an extra set of hands? Or two?

03:26.497 --> 03:29.298
Ha ha. Don't try to pawn
that fresh meat off on me.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.234
It was worth a shot.

03:31.236 --> 03:34.737
[man speaking indistinctly over P.A.]

03:37.407 --> 03:40.309
Welcome to Hope Zion. I'm Dr. Lin.

03:40.311 --> 03:43.746
I am a surgical fellow and
apparently your tour guide.

03:43.748 --> 03:45.481
Hi. I'm Cassie.

03:47.751 --> 03:50.451
Or Dr. Williams. [chuckles]

03:50.453 --> 03:51.953
It's up to you.

03:51.955 --> 03:53.088
Obviously.

03:53.090 --> 03:54.222
Asha: And I'm Asha.

03:54.224 --> 03:55.623
After the tour, will we be scrubbing in

03:55.625 --> 03:56.958
to assist on any surgeries?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.127
If you want surgical privileges,
you'll have to earn them.

03:59.129 --> 04:00.295
Anything else?

04:00.297 --> 04:01.529
No. No. I'm good.

04:01.531 --> 04:02.764
Good.

04:06.435 --> 04:08.303
Dr. Miller, how was your evening?

04:08.305 --> 04:10.672
That accent...

04:10.674 --> 04:12.907
you're sticking with that, huh?

04:12.909 --> 04:14.809
I'm not really sure how to answer that.

04:14.811 --> 04:16.610
Well, it doesn't really matter

04:16.612 --> 04:19.346
because I've forgotten
what we were talking about.

04:19.348 --> 04:20.947
We've got a possible O.D. on the way.

04:20.950 --> 04:22.183
Ambulance is a couple minutes out.

04:22.185 --> 04:23.650
Yay. Best part of my job...

04:23.652 --> 04:25.152
saving patients who don't want to live.

04:25.154 --> 04:26.987
Yeah, man. You need to lighten up.

04:29.524 --> 04:30.757
Do I seem heavy to you?

04:31.960 --> 04:34.728
[door opens] I guess it has been
a few days since I've had any fun.

04:34.730 --> 04:35.863
This is the E.R.

04:35.865 --> 04:37.764
Ask, and you shall receive.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
Hi.

04:39.802 --> 04:40.967
Come on.

04:40.969 --> 04:42.369
Welcome.

04:44.138 --> 04:45.872
[clears throat]

04:45.984 --> 04:47.959
You sleeping with Lin or something?

04:48.418 --> 04:50.675
Is everything about sex with you?

04:50.914 --> 04:51.678
No.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.199
Sometimes after sex, it's about food.

04:54.735 --> 04:56.316
Female, mid-20s. She's bradycardic.

04:56.318 --> 04:58.151
B.P. is 80 over 50. [radio chatter]

04:59.554 --> 05:01.287
I still have to pack.

05:01.289 --> 05:02.322
Hey. Hi. What's your name?

05:02.324 --> 05:04.123
Ava.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.392
I'm just gonna check your lungs now, Ava.

05:06.394 --> 05:09.229
[moans]

05:09.231 --> 05:10.830
She's flushed.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.531
Could be an ibuprofen O.D.

05:12.533 --> 05:13.632
Oh, yeah.

05:13.634 --> 05:15.235
Aah!

05:15.237 --> 05:17.370
[crying] Don't touch my face!

05:19.000 --> 05:25.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.062 --> 05:31.275
[siren wailing]

05:31.277 --> 05:34.211
This is the O.R. reception,
named for obvious reasons.

05:34.213 --> 05:36.947
[cellphone vibrates]
I have to take this. Wait here.

05:38.148 --> 05:41.417
â™ª

05:55.766 --> 05:58.234
Last stop on the tour... the lounge,

05:58.236 --> 06:02.338
where you can all have a juice
box and use the bathroom.

06:02.810 --> 06:05.608
So, um, I need to borrow a dummy.

06:05.610 --> 06:08.578
They're on a hospital tour with Lin.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.246
Sorry. what are you asking me?

06:10.248 --> 06:11.947
I'm doing a talk
on the trauma caused by CPR,

06:11.949 --> 06:13.749
so I need a-a visual aid.

06:13.751 --> 06:15.784
Okay. check the lab and
take whatever you need.

06:15.786 --> 06:16.784
Shahir: I need your help.

06:16.786 --> 06:19.216
- I don't miss your job.
- Mm.

06:19.384 --> 06:20.070
What do you need?

06:20.120 --> 06:22.157
[cellphone vibrates] Okay.
I'm seeing this lovely gentleman.

06:22.159 --> 06:23.558
He's tall. He's handsome.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.826
He calls his mother once a week.

06:24.828 --> 06:26.261
He volunteers at the humane society.

06:26.263 --> 06:27.962
- He's perfect.
- But?

06:29.565 --> 06:31.666
I had a cardiac event in bed.

06:31.668 --> 06:33.034
- What do you mean?
- Sex, Dr. Bell.

06:33.036 --> 06:35.137
- We were having sex.
- Yes. I got that part.

06:35.139 --> 06:36.804
I can't take any chances
after my heart attack,

06:36.806 --> 06:38.139
and-and-and you shouldn't, either.

06:38.141 --> 06:39.340
You know, I'm your top neurosurgeon.

06:39.342 --> 06:41.074
Okay, yes. Sure. I'm happy to help.

06:41.076 --> 06:42.743
We will wire you to the holter monitor,

06:42.745 --> 06:44.111
and we will go over the readout together

06:44.113 --> 06:45.679
before the donor dinner.

06:47.261 --> 06:49.136
You seem different.

06:50.158 --> 06:51.881
Are you on medication?

06:54.389 --> 06:57.824
â™ª

07:16.076 --> 07:18.211
Charlie, you mind putting that
away just while I'm in here?

07:18.213 --> 07:20.246
[sighs]

07:20.248 --> 07:21.514
Yeah. Sorry.

07:24.551 --> 07:26.985
[drawer closes]

07:29.155 --> 07:32.791
Uh, I need you to, uh, walk me through

07:32.793 --> 07:34.326
the night that Amy died.

07:36.062 --> 07:37.496
I know this is hard for you,

07:37.498 --> 07:39.798
but, uh, I kind of need to hear it from you

07:39.800 --> 07:41.533
and not from a police report.

07:43.969 --> 07:46.672
Yeah. Um...

07:46.674 --> 07:50.341
Amy asked me to draw her a bath
before I went out for my run.

07:50.343 --> 07:51.609
I came home an hour later.

07:51.611 --> 07:55.379
I went to shower, and she was [stammers]

07:55.381 --> 07:57.181
she was in the water.

07:57.183 --> 08:00.084
I tried to pull her up,
but my hands kept slipping.

08:00.086 --> 08:01.285
Yeah.

08:01.287 --> 08:04.855
Um... the prosecutor said that the, uh...

08:04.857 --> 08:06.156
the bruises on Amy

08:06.158 --> 08:08.992
prove that you, uh,
held her down and drowned her.

08:08.994 --> 08:10.595
I tried to grab any part of her I could

08:10.597 --> 08:11.995
to get her out of the water.

08:11.997 --> 08:13.863
Okay. What happened after you
got her out of the water?

08:13.865 --> 08:15.031
I put her down onto the floor.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.766
I started CPR.

08:16.768 --> 08:20.237
Her body was still warm,
so I knew I had a chance.

08:20.239 --> 08:22.038
And how long did you do CPR for?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.341
Two, three minutes.

08:24.343 --> 08:27.110
And then I stopped to call 911.

08:27.112 --> 08:30.247
Um... but at that point, it was too late.

08:30.249 --> 08:33.982
I put a towel over her body
before the medics showed up,

08:33.985 --> 08:35.818
just, you know...

08:35.820 --> 08:38.288
Uh, the, uh... the coroner

08:38.289 --> 08:40.556
found a fracture
in the back of Amy's skull.

08:40.558 --> 08:43.325
Yeah, from when I put
her down onto the floor.

08:45.162 --> 08:46.629
Okay, well, how were you, uh...

08:46.631 --> 08:48.631
how were you holding her when
you pulled her out of the tub?

08:48.633 --> 08:51.834
I had my arms wrapped around her chest.

08:51.836 --> 08:54.036
What, like, um...

08:59.409 --> 09:00.609
Like that?

09:00.611 --> 09:02.811
Yeah, just-just like that.

09:03.913 --> 09:05.781
[thud]

09:08.818 --> 09:10.686
You're sure about that?

09:10.688 --> 09:14.757
Well, I wasn't thinking about
her head when I put her down.

09:14.759 --> 09:17.893
I just wanted to start
CPR as fast as I could.

09:21.598 --> 09:23.432
Can you tell me how long
you've had the pain?

09:23.434 --> 09:25.768
Just what every patient likes to see...

09:25.770 --> 09:26.868
their doctor in a rush.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.504
You know what? You're right.

09:29.506 --> 09:31.372
- [groans]
- Let's do this again.

09:31.374 --> 09:34.810
Mr.-Mr. Lively. Hello.

09:34.812 --> 09:35.944
I'm Dr. Reid.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.078
Hi. Call me Ralph.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.980
Okay, Ralph. What's up?

09:38.982 --> 09:40.282
My cancer's back.

09:40.284 --> 09:42.117
Well, three years ago,

09:42.119 --> 09:43.982
you had curative surgery for colon cancer.

09:44.059 --> 09:45.298
I can't go through this again.

09:45.356 --> 09:46.922
Well, it might not be cancer.

09:46.924 --> 09:48.356
I'll have to run some tests to be sure.

09:48.358 --> 09:49.791
[groans]

09:49.793 --> 09:51.293
Excuse me.

09:51.295 --> 09:53.093
Can you take Mr. Lively up to imaging?

09:53.095 --> 09:55.032
And this is emergent, so if you can
bump him to the front of the line,

09:55.082 --> 09:57.431
- that would be great.
- You got it, Dr. Reid.

09:57.433 --> 09:58.498
See? There are some perks

09:58.500 --> 10:00.334
to having a doctor that's in a hurry.

10:01.469 --> 10:03.904
[key clacks]

10:03.906 --> 10:07.975
No! Is someone using the microwave?

10:07.977 --> 10:10.010
What did I say
when we toured the lounge?

10:10.012 --> 10:11.678
The fridge is not for urine samples?

10:11.988 --> 10:14.180
- What else?
- The microwave messes with the wi-fi.

10:14.182 --> 10:15.949
That's right, Dr. Sekara.

10:15.951 --> 10:18.918
So no more microwaving until
I'm in Cleveland, okay?

10:18.920 --> 10:21.721
Got your text. What's up?

10:21.723 --> 10:23.890
We each have to take a rookie for the day.

10:23.892 --> 10:26.392
- What?
- Dawn's orders.

10:26.394 --> 10:27.827
Fine.

10:27.829 --> 10:30.230
But I get the best one,
someone low-maintenance.

10:30.232 --> 10:31.497
Good luck with that.

10:31.499 --> 10:33.867
[sighs] Okay, pop quiz.

10:33.869 --> 10:34.901
Hurry up. Let's go.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.004
What is the primary indicator of
reoccurring colorectal cancer?

10:39.006 --> 10:40.706
Uh, serial carcinoembryonic antigen

10:40.708 --> 10:42.274
in, uh, asymptomatic patients.

10:42.276 --> 10:44.577
Great, but I didn't say my
patient was asymptomatic.

10:44.579 --> 10:46.879
Anybody else? Iron-deficiency anemia?

10:46.881 --> 10:48.681
Not bad. What about you, Dr...?

10:48.683 --> 10:51.016
Williams. Um, it depends
on the size and location

10:51.018 --> 10:52.985
and if anastomosis is affected.

10:52.987 --> 10:55.388
How would you like to assist
in an abdominal exploration?

10:55.390 --> 10:58.858
Me? Oh, yes. Um, yeah.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.292
But Dev's answer was also correct.

11:00.294 --> 11:04.161
Not as correct. Let's go.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.563
Hurry up.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.664
[squeals softly]

11:10.403 --> 11:13.204
Dr. Hamza. Uh, uh, I apologize.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.472
No. It's okay.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.807
I've been working out.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.475
Are you all right?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.444
It's too soon to tell.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.745
What can I help you with, Dr. Curtis?

11:20.747 --> 11:21.780
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.548
Okay.

11:27.085 --> 11:30.354
Ava? This is Dr. Hamza.

11:31.856 --> 11:33.690
If she overdosed,
she shouldn't be on morphine.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.160
It's a light dosage on a slow drip.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.029
I did a full liver and blood work-up.
There's no permanent damage.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.131
I didn't mean to take so many pills.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.199
Ava's been suffering from acute facial pain.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.802
Anytime she or anyone
else touches her face...

11:44.804 --> 11:46.137
The pain is unbearable.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.604
How bad is it, on a scale of 1 to 10?

11:47.606 --> 11:49.106
[breathes deeply]

11:49.108 --> 11:50.607
A 17.

11:50.609 --> 11:53.544
Your brain C.T. will tell us
everything we need to know

11:53.546 --> 11:55.979
to diagnose the issue, whatever that may be.

11:55.981 --> 11:58.114
I'm supposed to be
on a flight to Paris tomorrow.

11:58.116 --> 11:59.850
Well, yeah, you might want to reschedule.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.852
It may take us awhile to diagnose the issue.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.988
Ava, the brain is a wonderful
and mysterious organ.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.223
Sorry. I'm just frustrated.

12:07.225 --> 12:09.159
I've been planning Paris for months.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.460
What's the occasion?

12:10.462 --> 12:13.529
It's my boyfriend, Xavier.

12:13.531 --> 12:14.897
I'm moving out there to be with him.

12:14.899 --> 12:16.499
You may want to reconsider.

12:16.501 --> 12:17.767
If you think you're in pain now,

12:17.769 --> 12:19.301
wait until the relationship ends.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.570
[laughs nervously]

12:20.572 --> 12:23.706
He's, uh, obviously joking.

12:23.708 --> 12:26.709
Angelo Marro.

12:26.711 --> 12:27.877
That's me.

12:27.879 --> 12:29.512
I got a little banged up on the job.

12:29.514 --> 12:31.279
Okay, let's take a look at what we got.

12:31.281 --> 12:32.647
Whoa, whoa.

12:32.649 --> 12:35.149
Just give me a cortisone shot,
and I'll be on my way.

12:35.151 --> 12:37.953
Okay, well, I can't give
you a cortisone shot

12:37.955 --> 12:39.420
until I take a look at what's going on.

12:39.422 --> 12:41.356
I've never missed
a day of work in my life.

12:41.358 --> 12:43.424
I'm not gonna start now.

12:43.426 --> 12:45.527
Okay.

12:45.529 --> 12:46.628
Where do you work?

12:46.630 --> 12:48.930
You're looking at it.

12:48.932 --> 12:51.967
Been a custodian in Hope Zion for 10 years.

12:51.969 --> 12:53.735
Yeah, of course. Hey.

12:53.737 --> 12:55.203
You don't need
to pretend you recognize me.

12:55.205 --> 12:58.373
Look... you're one of our own,

12:58.375 --> 13:00.975
so all the more reason
to be thorough, right?

13:00.977 --> 13:02.442
All right.

13:04.345 --> 13:05.345
Okay.

13:05.347 --> 13:07.347
[gasps]

13:07.349 --> 13:09.349
Okay.

13:15.557 --> 13:16.624
Whoa.

13:16.626 --> 13:19.038
It looks way worse than it is.

13:19.595 --> 13:22.863
Uh... okay.

13:22.865 --> 13:24.531
Someone page Dr. Harris.

13:24.828 --> 13:26.599
Will we be going in laparoscopically,

13:26.601 --> 13:29.002
- or are we gonna open him up?
- I haven't decided yet.

13:29.202 --> 13:31.015
Oh, and by the way, don't ever do that again.

13:31.065 --> 13:32.839
- Do what?
- Try to give away a surgery.

13:32.841 --> 13:34.041
I don't care if they're your friends.

13:34.043 --> 13:35.975
Oh, Dev's not my friend, per se.

13:35.977 --> 13:38.811
I mean, we share study notes and
occasionally a futon, but...

13:38.813 --> 13:41.415
Dr. Williams, you're my
junior resident, not my buddy,

13:41.417 --> 13:43.416
and if you make my workday any
longer than it needs to be,

13:43.418 --> 13:44.717
you're gonna be sorry I picked you.

13:44.719 --> 13:45.451
Got it?

13:45.453 --> 13:48.621
[door opens]

13:48.623 --> 13:50.890
So, there definitely is a
blockage in your belly.

13:50.892 --> 13:51.991
We're just waiting for the lab

13:51.993 --> 13:53.492
to give us a blood and liver work-up

13:53.494 --> 13:56.362
to just help us narrow
down the possible causes.

13:56.364 --> 13:58.431
Whatever you need to do to help me.

13:58.433 --> 13:59.799
Do you want us to call your family?

13:59.801 --> 14:01.935
No. I don't want to worry
them until we figure this out.

14:01.937 --> 14:03.036
I'm sorry. Who are you?

14:03.038 --> 14:05.038
This is Dr. Williams, my resident.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.705
- She'll be assisting me.
Ralph: - Her?

14:06.707 --> 14:08.607
No offense,
but you look like a girl guide.

14:08.609 --> 14:10.309
- [sighs]
- She's a junior resident.

14:10.311 --> 14:11.643
And this is a teaching hospital.

14:11.645 --> 14:14.680
Okay, but no mistakes, no missteps.

14:14.682 --> 14:16.515
Can only cheat death so many [groans]...

14:16.517 --> 14:17.683
Ralph, what's going on?

14:17.685 --> 14:19.751
- It hurts!
- When you're breathing in?

14:21.121 --> 14:23.055
Pain in the right upper quadrant
increases when breathing.

14:23.057 --> 14:24.323
[monitor beeping] Gallstones.

14:24.325 --> 14:27.059
- Ohh!
- Okay, he's febrile, tachycardic.

14:27.061 --> 14:28.394
Could be a gallbladder rupture.

14:28.396 --> 14:29.995
I need 10cc of ketorolac.

14:29.997 --> 14:30.996
I don't know where that is.

14:30.998 --> 14:32.064
The nurse's station.

14:32.066 --> 14:33.098
Hurry up.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.732
Ralph, you're gonna be okay, all right?

14:34.734 --> 14:36.667
- Okay.
- Just try to breathe.

14:36.669 --> 14:38.903
[breathes deeply] You're gonna be okay.

14:41.566 --> 14:43.350
- Sure.
- Mr. Marro.

14:43.352 --> 14:46.119
It appears as though you
have mulched your elbow.

14:46.121 --> 14:49.890
- As you can see, the joint is in pieces.
- Oh, no.

14:49.892 --> 14:51.792
Looks like a map of the Philippines.

14:51.794 --> 14:54.194
There's Manila down there.

14:54.953 --> 14:57.633
I was "jeopardy!" champion
of my living room.

14:57.860 --> 15:00.366
Um, can you move your fingers for me?

15:00.368 --> 15:02.102
Peripheral nerve is good.

15:02.104 --> 15:03.503
You are neurovascularly intact.

15:03.505 --> 15:05.806
Great. Slap a cast on it
and send me on my way.

15:05.808 --> 15:08.474
Uh, yeah, a cast won't work.
There's too many bone fragments.

15:08.476 --> 15:11.178
We're talking about a
total elbow replacement.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.745
An implant?

15:12.747 --> 15:14.147
How long will I be off for?

15:14.149 --> 15:15.916
Four to six weeks.
I can't be off work that long.

15:15.918 --> 15:17.918
- File for disability.
- Yeah, right.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.370
And navigate
that kafkaesque nightmare.

15:20.522 --> 15:22.487
- Kafka?
- Yeah. I read.

15:22.701 --> 15:24.723
Angelo, if you... if you carry
on with your current occupation,

15:24.725 --> 15:27.126
a new elbow's not gonna last you two years.

15:27.128 --> 15:29.094
And it's gonna be worse off than before.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.031
We're talking about immobility,
scar tissue, nerve damage.

15:32.081 --> 15:33.151
Cut to the chase.

15:33.201 --> 15:34.799
You need to start thinking
about getting another job.

15:34.802 --> 15:36.702
What are you... a surgeon
or a guidance counselor?

15:36.704 --> 15:38.204
Come on, guys.

15:38.206 --> 15:39.872
There's got to be another option.

15:39.874 --> 15:41.841
Well, normally I would repair
it using plates and screws...

15:41.843 --> 15:43.642
Fine. Do that.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.545
If it doesn't work, we can
talk about me quitting my job.

15:46.547 --> 15:48.413
Uh, actually, we need to
talk about that right now.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.984
I need your permission for both options...

15:51.986 --> 15:55.753
In case I open up your arm,
and depending on what I find...

15:55.755 --> 15:57.288
All right.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.157
Get me the consent form.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.225
Bring it here, and I'll sign it.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.493
Okay.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.562
Guys's got no intention of quitting.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.465
[cellphone vibrates]
Ah, well, he better hope I can fix it.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.334
Yep?

16:14.139 --> 16:15.506
What are you doing?

16:15.508 --> 16:18.242
Oh, uh, just a little visualization.

16:18.244 --> 16:21.044
Dr. Reid, thank you for the opportunity

16:21.046 --> 16:22.279
to observe your cholecystectomy.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.281
You're not <i>observing.
You're assisting.</i>

16:24.283 --> 16:26.516
As long as you're in there,
you're gonna be working.

16:26.518 --> 16:29.569
Oh, great. That's great.

16:30.018 --> 16:32.189
Sink or swim, Dr. Williams.

16:33.224 --> 16:36.226
[sighs]

16:36.228 --> 16:37.660
[breathes deeply]

16:37.662 --> 16:39.262
Hey.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.763
Um...

16:40.765 --> 16:42.031
Just promise me you won't overreact

16:42.033 --> 16:43.399
'cause this is
actually really good news.

16:43.401 --> 16:44.800
- What is?
- The nanny called,

16:44.802 --> 16:47.836
and Luke took his first steps.

16:47.838 --> 16:48.871
Really?

16:48.873 --> 16:50.172
Oh, my god.

16:51.433 --> 16:53.709
Oh, wow. Look at him.

16:53.711 --> 16:54.944
Oh, he's just so great.

16:54.946 --> 16:56.012
I know.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.915
[sighs] I can't believe I missed this.

16:59.596 --> 17:00.682
I know. I'm sorry.

17:01.952 --> 17:04.586
No, I... I'm s... I'm scrubbed.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.587
Al.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.755
It's fine.

17:06.757 --> 17:09.791
[voice breaking] I have to work.

17:13.663 --> 17:16.164
[sniffles]

17:16.165 --> 17:18.666
- Dr. Reid, are you okay?
- Knife.

17:18.669 --> 17:20.367
Have you been crying?

17:20.369 --> 17:22.404
Dr. Williams, if you want
to remain in this O.R.,

17:22.406 --> 17:24.772
You will limit
your conversations to the work.

17:24.775 --> 17:26.241
Prepare to suction.

17:26.242 --> 17:28.276
Yes. Of course.

17:28.278 --> 17:29.545
[air hissing]

17:33.115 --> 17:35.083
Is everything okay?

17:35.085 --> 17:36.784
I'm trying to rebook my flight to Paris,

17:36.786 --> 17:38.954
and the only seats left are
way out of my price range.

17:39.770 --> 17:43.275
You don't think
this is all a sign, do you?

17:43.449 --> 17:45.593
Like maybe I shouldn't be
uprooting my life like this?

17:45.595 --> 17:47.795
Well, it's a risk, of course.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.032
But a leap of faith for love...

17:51.751 --> 17:53.868
What could be more exhilarating than that?

17:54.351 --> 17:56.161
Trigeminal neuralgia.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.343
- I'm sorry?
- It's what you have.

17:58.434 --> 18:00.778
It's a chronic pain condition
that affects this nerve.

18:01.075 --> 18:02.641
It's the nerve that carries sensation

18:02.691 --> 18:03.994
from your face to your brain.

18:04.091 --> 18:06.514
You may have a blood vessel
constricting that nerve.

18:06.516 --> 18:08.483
- Can you fix it?
- Yes.

18:08.485 --> 18:10.852
Through anticonvulsants and antispasmodics,

18:10.854 --> 18:13.354
many patients feel some
relief within a few months.

18:13.356 --> 18:14.856
I don't want <i>some</i> relief.

18:14.858 --> 18:16.657
I want the pain gone.

18:16.877 --> 18:20.940
I want Xavier to be able to
touch me without causing me pain.

18:21.251 --> 18:23.343
Okay, well, there are surgical options.

18:23.595 --> 18:25.032
Okay. Tell me more about those.

18:25.034 --> 18:27.067
Microvascular decompression.

18:27.069 --> 18:30.871
Right. 90% of patients feel
permanent and immediate relief.

18:30.873 --> 18:32.038
- However...
- Okay.

18:32.463 --> 18:33.590
There are risks.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.403
The most common complications with MVD

18:35.453 --> 18:36.676
are nerve damage...

18:37.228 --> 18:38.820
Which can lead to hearing loss,

18:38.870 --> 18:40.904
facial numbness, double vision...

18:41.136 --> 18:42.488
paralysis.

18:44.525 --> 18:45.919
Paralysis?

18:54.217 --> 18:55.998
What w... what would you do?

18:57.850 --> 19:01.067
I'd probably postpone the move
and try the drug therapy first.

19:01.069 --> 19:03.136
Don't answer me as a doctor.

19:03.391 --> 19:06.285
Answer me as the romantic you obviously are.

19:06.674 --> 19:09.575
Dr. Hamza is the best
neurosurgeon in the country.

19:10.319 --> 19:12.512
But, look,
this has to be <i>your</i> decision.

19:19.911 --> 19:21.563
I'd like to have the surgery.

19:22.708 --> 19:23.923
All right, then.

19:24.227 --> 19:25.891
I'll book an O.R.

19:30.797 --> 19:32.565
[indistinct conversations]

19:32.567 --> 19:34.132
[whistles]

19:34.134 --> 19:35.733
Dr. Miller!

19:35.735 --> 19:38.803
Think I can I get some more
pain meds before my surgery?

19:39.163 --> 19:40.638
I'm really starting to feel this thing.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.381
I'm not a nurse, but I'll send one.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.297
You're kind of a prick. You know that?

19:45.444 --> 19:48.302
Joel always said you were
the fun guy around here.

19:50.383 --> 19:52.217
- You knew Joel?
- Sure.

19:52.557 --> 19:55.453
The custodians had a weekly
poker game in the basement.

19:55.764 --> 19:58.570
Joel used to come by
whenever he had time to kill.

19:58.786 --> 20:00.024
Joel was terrible at poker.

20:00.026 --> 20:01.993
[chuckling]
Why do you think I kept inviting him?

20:01.995 --> 20:03.828
[chuckles] He was a good guy, though.

20:03.830 --> 20:06.807
Always trying to get me to drop
the mop and go back to school.

20:06.962 --> 20:08.232
Oh, he was just trying to get rid of you

20:08.234 --> 20:09.834
- so he could win his money back.
- Sure.

20:10.492 --> 20:13.455
He even bet me 100 bucks once
I couldn't pass the lsats.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.807
- How'd you do?
- 166.

20:16.066 --> 20:17.361
He still owes me the $100.

20:17.411 --> 20:19.299
Well, good luck getting that back.

20:24.148 --> 20:25.490
Look...

20:25.881 --> 20:28.619
If you're some kind of
genius lawyer in the making,

20:28.621 --> 20:30.654
what are you doing pushing
a mop here at Hope-Zee?

20:30.656 --> 20:33.724
Same thing you're doing... making a living.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.528
Looks like my ride's here.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.030
We'll see you 'round.

20:44.739 --> 20:46.503
Take me through the next steps.

20:46.505 --> 20:48.505
First we identify calot's triangle.

20:48.507 --> 20:50.740
Then we ligate the cystic duct.

20:50.742 --> 20:51.941
Sounds good.

20:51.943 --> 20:54.877
Oh. You want me to do it?

20:54.879 --> 20:55.945
Let's see what you can do.

20:55.947 --> 21:00.283
[monitors beeping]

21:02.853 --> 21:05.988
[breathes deeply]
Forceps and right angle.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.957
Thank you.

21:08.549 --> 21:11.066
Okay, he has a lot of adhesions
from his cancer surgeries,

21:11.116 --> 21:13.411
so be sure of the anatomy before you cut.

21:13.461 --> 21:14.978
Do you have a good visual?

21:15.150 --> 21:16.777
Yes.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.802
Okay. It's tied off.

21:20.584 --> 21:22.337
Next I'll be tying off the cystic artery,

21:22.339 --> 21:24.761
then mobilizing
the gallbladder off the bed.

21:24.975 --> 21:26.787
We have a general surgeon in the making.

21:26.837 --> 21:27.976
[chuckles]

21:28.478 --> 21:29.744
[gasps] Oh, crap.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.812
What's wrong?

21:30.814 --> 21:32.147
[breathing heavily] Okay. Assess.

21:32.149 --> 21:34.015
Cassie, did you cut the common bile duct?

21:34.017 --> 21:36.151
Incise the visceral peritoneum
overlying of the gallbladder fundus.

21:36.153 --> 21:38.053
Cassie, snap out of it.
You got to do something here.

21:38.055 --> 21:39.721
Grasp the dome of the gallbladder with a
kelly clamp and elevate it superiorly.

21:39.723 --> 21:40.822
Cassie, you got to back
away so I can get in there.

21:40.824 --> 21:42.390
Cassie, move. Cassie, move.

21:42.392 --> 21:45.426
- Out.
- Okay, 4-0 chromic suture.

21:45.428 --> 21:47.428
Retract, please.

21:47.430 --> 21:49.530
Damn it, I need another
set of hands in here!

21:49.532 --> 21:51.999
I'll page another resident.

21:52.001 --> 21:53.701
[monitor beeping rapidly]

21:53.703 --> 21:55.336
No. Wait.

21:55.338 --> 21:56.870
Let me throw in a couple of sutures,

21:56.872 --> 21:58.206
and then, uh, give me a minute.

22:01.376 --> 22:02.876
Nurse: He's stabilizing.

22:04.379 --> 22:06.013
Give me a towel, please.

22:07.381 --> 22:09.482
Unbelievable.

22:09.484 --> 22:10.818
[sighs]

22:13.354 --> 22:16.389
Cassie: [breathing heavily]

22:16.391 --> 22:17.691
- Is he okay?
- He's stable.

22:17.693 --> 22:18.926
Dr. Williams, what happened in there?

22:18.928 --> 22:20.293
I thought I was
cutting through an adhesion,

22:20.295 --> 22:21.428
and the bile duct was underneath.

22:21.430 --> 22:22.596
So you fix it with a stitch.

22:22.598 --> 22:24.131
- I know.
- Then why didn't you?

22:24.133 --> 22:26.466
I-I just kept hearing his voice...

22:26.468 --> 22:28.235
"no missteps, no mistakes"...

22:28.237 --> 22:31.971
and I-I thought, "he beat cancer,
and I'm gonna kill him."

22:31.973 --> 22:34.440
So you walk out on him instead?

22:34.442 --> 22:36.475
I knew that you had it under control.

22:36.477 --> 22:38.510
It was <i>your</i> mistake.
You needed to fix it.

22:38.512 --> 22:40.179
I was right there
beside you the whole time.

22:40.181 --> 22:41.180
I was supporting you.

22:41.182 --> 22:42.414
No, that's not how it felt!

22:42.416 --> 22:44.250
Look, I-I know that I shouldn't care

22:44.252 --> 22:46.385
whether or not you have any
confidence in my abilities,

22:46.387 --> 22:48.921
but I do
because I'm actually terrified.

22:48.923 --> 22:51.924
Which is why you tried to
give the surgery to Dev.

22:54.728 --> 22:56.328
Cassie, look at me.

22:56.330 --> 22:58.798
Look at me.

23:00.367 --> 23:03.235
Everybody's terrified the first time.

23:03.237 --> 23:06.405
And that in there... a version
of it has happened to all of us.

23:08.074 --> 23:10.743
But giving up on a patient,
giving up on a surgery...

23:10.745 --> 23:12.478
It's inexcusable.

23:14.814 --> 23:16.348
You need to suck it up.

23:16.350 --> 23:19.718
Get your ass back in there
and finish what you started.

23:24.916 --> 23:26.484
[beep]

23:29.220 --> 23:30.654
Hey. How'd the elbow do?

23:30.656 --> 23:32.389
Uh, no matter how many
plates or screws I put in,

23:32.391 --> 23:33.623
the joint wouldn't hold.

23:33.625 --> 23:35.291
- So you had to give him a new one.
- Yeah.

23:35.293 --> 23:36.926
The best thing we can do for Angelo

23:36.928 --> 23:38.628
is convince him
to find another line of work.

23:38.630 --> 23:40.062
Unfortunately, I know guys like him.

23:40.064 --> 23:41.230
They're very stubborn.

23:41.232 --> 23:42.799
Well, we're gonna see him
in another couple years

23:42.801 --> 23:44.367
when he blows the new elbow out then.

23:44.369 --> 23:45.869
Yeah, and his arm's so messed up,

23:45.871 --> 23:47.303
he can't even tie his own shoes.

23:47.305 --> 23:48.337
Thanks.

23:49.707 --> 23:51.374
Hell of a surgery, doc.

23:53.811 --> 23:56.645
Um... you saw that?

23:56.647 --> 23:59.148
Best show in town...

23:59.150 --> 24:01.150
Until I figure
how to sneak into a leafs game.

24:01.152 --> 24:03.185
Oh, don't do that.
That's... that's not worth it.

24:03.187 --> 24:06.255
Beats rooting for the oilers.

24:06.257 --> 24:07.656
I still can't get over '88.

24:07.658 --> 24:10.192
Right. That's when they traded
"the great one," isn't it?

24:10.194 --> 24:12.328
I was 7 years old.

24:12.330 --> 24:13.595
Cried like a baby.

24:13.597 --> 24:16.565
First time I realized how
unfair life could be,

24:16.567 --> 24:19.568
that you could invest so
much time into something

24:19.570 --> 24:20.602
and it could all disappear

24:20.604 --> 24:23.104
because of someone else's mistake.

24:23.106 --> 24:24.573
Yeah.

24:24.575 --> 24:27.275
Well, I need to go see my patient, so...

24:27.277 --> 24:29.077
See you in the morgue.

24:30.547 --> 24:32.380
[monitor beeping] Scissors.

24:43.091 --> 24:45.259
Your technique is exquisite.

24:48.664 --> 24:50.497
Did Dr. Bell tell you

24:50.499 --> 24:52.533
that I'm on the jury for
the fellowship award?

24:52.535 --> 24:53.734
She may have mentioned it.

24:53.736 --> 24:55.770
You don't have to suck up to me, Dr. Curtis.

24:55.772 --> 24:57.404
Your record speaks for itself.

24:58.031 --> 25:00.774
Hmm. The superior cerebellar artery

25:00.776 --> 25:02.542
seems to be
the one causing all the fuss.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.045
It's adhering
to the trigeminal nerve.

25:05.047 --> 25:06.546
The compression must be causing her pain.

25:07.847 --> 25:10.578
Okay, I'd like to prepare the sponge.

25:11.186 --> 25:13.486
You were top of your class at Oxford.

25:13.488 --> 25:16.522
You interned at King's College,

25:16.524 --> 25:18.959
did your residency at St. George's,

25:18.961 --> 25:21.227
and a fellowship year at Royal Berkshire.

25:21.229 --> 25:22.596
You've committed my record to memory.

25:22.598 --> 25:23.663
I'm flattered.

25:23.665 --> 25:25.164
Don't be. I have an encyclopedic memory.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.599
[chuckles]

25:26.601 --> 25:28.468
But there's a 18-month gap, Dr. Curtis,

25:28.470 --> 25:30.103
where you completely fell off the grid.

25:30.105 --> 25:32.004
What happened?

25:32.006 --> 25:34.373
Dr. Hamza, um...

25:34.375 --> 25:35.508
this surgery is so complex.

25:35.510 --> 25:37.176
I-I really feel like I need to focus

25:37.178 --> 25:38.711
if I'm gonna absorb it all.

25:38.713 --> 25:42.281
Fair point.

25:42.283 --> 25:44.450
Okay, I'm gonna insert the sponge

25:44.452 --> 25:47.685
in between the artery and the nerve.

25:47.687 --> 25:49.954
Perfect fit.

25:49.956 --> 25:52.056
Hmm.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.463
Are you having
a nice little moment there?

25:58.465 --> 26:01.199
Who knew having a bionic
elbow would be so itchy?

26:02.968 --> 26:05.870
I see Dr. Harris
already told you the bad news.

26:05.872 --> 26:07.305
Yeah.

26:07.307 --> 26:08.873
Said it was like
a jigsaw puzzle in there,

26:08.875 --> 26:11.009
couldn't be fixed.

26:11.011 --> 26:12.409
You win some, you lose some.

26:14.713 --> 26:16.848
You need to find another job, Angelo.

26:16.850 --> 26:18.549
Otherwise, you risk losing
the use of that arm.

26:19.772 --> 26:21.485
What do you care?

26:21.843 --> 26:24.488
I saw the way you looked
at me when I came in here.

26:24.490 --> 26:26.357
Now all of a sudden we're friends

26:26.359 --> 26:29.226
because I played a couple hands
of poker with your buddy Joel?

26:29.228 --> 26:31.228
You know, your whole hard-done-by,

26:31.230 --> 26:32.282
working-class thing...

26:32.332 --> 26:34.265
Sorry? "Thing"?

26:34.267 --> 26:36.332
- It's a thing?
- Yeah, w...

26:36.334 --> 26:38.401
What do you think,
that there's some inherent nobility

26:38.403 --> 26:39.469
in being working class?

26:39.471 --> 26:40.937
Marx said so.

26:40.939 --> 26:42.064
There you go. I knew it.

26:42.144 --> 26:44.407
You like trying to prove to me
how smart you are, don't you?

26:44.409 --> 26:46.342
I got nothing to prove to anybody,
especially a...

26:46.344 --> 26:48.444
A what? A what?
A rich prick in a lab coat?

26:48.446 --> 26:51.347
My father worked
at Algoma Steel for 35 years

26:51.349 --> 26:53.283
and died of lung cancer at 56,

26:53.285 --> 26:57.387
so don't tell me about the working man.

26:57.389 --> 26:59.156
Algoma?

26:59.158 --> 27:00.824
You're from the soo.

27:00.826 --> 27:03.359
I grew up there, yeah.

27:03.361 --> 27:04.928
Me too.

27:04.930 --> 27:05.995
Elliot Lake.

27:05.997 --> 27:07.730
Mm.

27:09.432 --> 27:12.267
I was the first one in my
family to go to university.

27:12.269 --> 27:14.536
Same here.

27:14.538 --> 27:17.306
My dad and my brother worked at the foundry.

27:17.308 --> 27:20.042
I got a humanities degree.

27:20.044 --> 27:22.444
A lot of good that did me.

27:25.648 --> 27:28.017
What do you think is gonna
happen if you do something else,

27:28.019 --> 27:31.386
something more than they did?

27:31.388 --> 27:33.989
[sighs]

27:33.991 --> 27:35.791
<i>You</i> tell <i>me.</i>

27:35.793 --> 27:40.762
I'm telling you,
you have to do something more...

27:40.764 --> 27:43.631
especially when it means
losing that arm if you don't.

27:43.633 --> 27:47.168
[breathes deeply]

27:47.170 --> 27:49.838
[monitors beeping]

27:49.840 --> 27:51.405
Problem solved.

27:51.407 --> 27:53.174
All right.

27:55.811 --> 27:57.045
I want you to close.

27:57.047 --> 27:58.479
Okay.

28:03.885 --> 28:05.686
Needle driver.

28:11.326 --> 28:13.160
Take a breath.

28:13.162 --> 28:17.030
[breathes deeply]

28:17.032 --> 28:19.634
Better.

28:19.636 --> 28:20.668
You've got this.

28:31.879 --> 28:33.146
How's our patient?

28:33.148 --> 28:34.281
Still out from the anesthetic.

28:34.283 --> 28:35.282
[breathes sharply]

28:35.284 --> 28:37.817
Good. The rest will do her good.

28:41.622 --> 28:44.457
I need help drafting
a response to this e-mail.

28:47.295 --> 28:51.164
"Dear Shahir, I don't understand
what happened last night."

28:51.166 --> 28:53.299
"Call me."

28:53.301 --> 28:54.300
Okay. [clears throat]

28:54.302 --> 28:55.668
So, what's a gentler way of saying,

28:55.670 --> 28:57.002
"we won't be seeing each other anymore."

28:57.004 --> 28:59.471
"I'm afraid for my life"? [chuckles]

28:59.473 --> 29:00.706
Are you having me on?

29:00.708 --> 29:02.207
No.

29:02.209 --> 29:04.209
[telephone rings]

29:04.211 --> 29:07.045
Mm-hmm?

29:07.047 --> 29:09.080
Something is wrong with Ava.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.151
â™ª

29:13.153 --> 29:14.553
It started when she came out of sedation.

29:14.555 --> 29:16.121
Dr. Hamza, I can't make it stop.

29:16.123 --> 29:17.422
[monitor beeping rapidly]

29:17.424 --> 29:18.857
Unh. My heart.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.371
Y-you fixed it.

29:33.373 --> 29:35.473
I-I just gave it something to do.

29:35.475 --> 29:37.142
Ava, look at me.

29:37.144 --> 29:38.976
Follow this light with your eyes, okay?

29:38.978 --> 29:41.678
Ava, are you in any pain?

29:41.680 --> 29:43.580
Um, barely.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.983
Dr. Hamza, what's happening to me?

29:45.985 --> 29:48.118
Pupil response is normal.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.653
Do you have any vision problems, Ava?

29:49.655 --> 29:51.621
Dizziness? Any changes to your coordination?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.257
Um... [snaps fingers] Memory loss?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.691
Fatigue?

29:54.693 --> 29:56.060
No, nothing. Why?

29:56.062 --> 29:57.228
The trigeminal neuralgia...

29:57.230 --> 29:58.963
I think it was masking
an underlying condition,

29:58.965 --> 30:00.497
and now other symptoms are surfacing.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.000
W-what condition?

30:04.903 --> 30:06.670
Multiple sclerosis.

30:08.373 --> 30:10.306
We'll have to run some more tests.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.475
Even then, diagnosing M.S. is difficult.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.443
You see, it's a diagnosis of exclusion,

30:14.445 --> 30:16.846
which means we have to rule
out everything else first.

30:16.848 --> 30:20.016
But...

30:20.018 --> 30:21.650
that's what you think I have?

30:21.652 --> 30:23.853
Yes.

30:33.130 --> 30:35.179
Cassie: I thought you should hear it from me

30:35.181 --> 30:37.781
and know that I will be
informing the chief of surgery

30:37.783 --> 30:39.717
of my mistake.

30:39.719 --> 30:41.819
Am I gonna have any weird side effects?

30:41.821 --> 30:43.754
You shouldn't.

30:43.756 --> 30:46.224
Then why so glum?

30:46.226 --> 30:48.226
I'm down a gallbladder,

30:48.228 --> 30:50.294
and my bile duct... whatever that does...

30:50.296 --> 30:51.562
has a couple stitches in it.

30:52.124 --> 30:54.031
I'm alive. I'm still cancer-free.

30:54.033 --> 30:55.333
It's a great day.

30:55.919 --> 30:58.936
I'll check in on you again
before I leave for the day.

31:00.371 --> 31:02.906
That's good patient care, Dr. Williams.

31:05.043 --> 31:07.244
I take it you're feeling better?

31:07.246 --> 31:08.345
Well, a little tender,

31:08.347 --> 31:10.748
but compared to before, it's a breeze.

31:10.750 --> 31:11.982
[laughs]

31:11.984 --> 31:13.383
You know, they say gallstones

31:13.385 --> 31:15.019
are the closest pain to childbirth.

31:15.021 --> 31:16.954
I should get my wife some flowers.

31:16.956 --> 31:17.955
[laughs]

31:17.957 --> 31:19.222
So you have kids?

31:19.224 --> 31:22.358
Three. All girls.

31:22.360 --> 31:23.693
Loves of my life.

31:23.695 --> 31:27.363
You seem less wired than before.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.036
Um...

31:33.038 --> 31:35.538
Mr. Lively, I owe you an apology.

31:35.540 --> 31:38.875
I was hoping to get home before
my son took his first steps.

31:38.877 --> 31:40.609
They happened without you?

31:40.611 --> 31:44.681
Listen, when I was first
diagnosed with cancer,

31:44.683 --> 31:46.115
I had to get used to the idea

31:46.117 --> 31:47.950
that I was gonna miss everything...

31:47.952 --> 31:51.087
birthdays, graduations, weddings...

31:51.089 --> 31:53.621
Hopefully in that order.

31:53.623 --> 31:56.658
Those milestones...

31:56.660 --> 31:58.526
they're not the end of something.

31:58.528 --> 32:00.662
They're just the beginning.

32:00.664 --> 32:01.730
You'll see.

32:01.732 --> 32:04.232
There are my girls.

32:04.234 --> 32:06.001
Easy on the hugs.

32:06.003 --> 32:07.769
He's still sore.

32:07.771 --> 32:09.571
Hey, guys. Great to see you.

32:09.573 --> 32:12.174
Did you forget something, Dr. Williams?

32:12.176 --> 32:15.276
I, uh... I couldn't help but overhear...

32:15.278 --> 32:16.276
about your son.

32:16.278 --> 32:17.477
I'm sorry.

32:17.479 --> 32:19.446
Cost of doing the job, I guess.

32:19.448 --> 32:21.481
I'll get over it... I hope.

32:21.483 --> 32:23.617
So, are you dragging yourself to this event?

32:23.619 --> 32:25.552
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I-I'll see you there.

32:25.554 --> 32:27.188
- Sure.
- Dr. Reid?

32:27.190 --> 32:28.422
Yeah?

32:28.424 --> 32:30.657
For what it's worth,

32:30.659 --> 32:33.127
you were there for <i>my</i> first steps...

32:33.129 --> 32:34.161
So thank you.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.501
â™ª

32:46.273 --> 32:48.174
[cellphone vibrates]

32:50.244 --> 32:51.878
Hello?

32:51.880 --> 32:53.646
Yes. Nice to hear from you.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.753
How is that... how is that possible?

33:09.929 --> 33:11.731
Hey. Just handing in my application.

33:11.733 --> 33:12.931
If I can't win mother of the year,

33:12.933 --> 33:14.900
I might as well win fellow of the year.

33:14.902 --> 33:16.736
Maggs? What's up?

33:16.738 --> 33:19.639
There's no job for me in Cleveland.

33:19.641 --> 33:22.207
Uh, the funding fell through.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.441
[clears throat]

33:23.443 --> 33:26.478
God, I'm-I'm sorry.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.045
Hey, listen.
Let's get you an application.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.748
There's no time to fill it out now.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.516
Well, we can photocopy mine.

33:31.518 --> 33:32.984
We can fill in a few things. It'll be great.

33:32.986 --> 33:34.619
- I just...
- It's too late.

33:36.255 --> 33:39.190
At least I get to stay here with you, right?

33:41.026 --> 33:43.928
You should go.

33:46.598 --> 33:50.867
â™ª

33:50.869 --> 33:53.404
Dr. Hamza, you look so handsome.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.373
Social worker stop by?

33:57.260 --> 34:00.243
Yeah, I asked her for some reading material,

34:00.245 --> 34:02.513
but these are actually
making me feel a lot worse.

34:02.515 --> 34:05.115
Ava, M.S. is not a death sentence.

34:05.117 --> 34:06.283
Many of those diagnosed

34:06.285 --> 34:07.718
still continue their everyday activities.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.687
Yeah, I know.

34:09.688 --> 34:11.154
It says that right here,

34:11.156 --> 34:13.791
along with, "2/3 of individuals with M.S."

34:13.793 --> 34:17.060
"will not suffer paralysis
or a major disability."

34:17.062 --> 34:18.594
Precisely.

34:18.596 --> 34:20.396
You can still live your
life and go to Paris.

34:20.398 --> 34:22.264
[scoffs]

34:22.266 --> 34:25.235
I'm not going to Paris.

34:25.237 --> 34:28.404
All these hopeful words...

34:28.406 --> 34:30.739
"most patients," "2/3 of individuals."

34:30.742 --> 34:32.641
I mean, I can't help but feel

34:32.643 --> 34:35.145
that those are terrible
odds to build a future on.

34:35.147 --> 34:37.246
Don't make any rash decisions, Ava.

34:37.248 --> 34:40.683
This is all very new for you.

34:40.685 --> 34:43.018
Have you ever been in love, Dr. Hamza?

34:46.157 --> 34:47.657
Yes.

34:50.027 --> 34:51.922
Once.

34:52.530 --> 34:54.496
What happened?

34:58.101 --> 35:00.737
We had three wonderful years,
and then it all fell apart.

35:05.275 --> 35:08.811
Would you do it all over again...

35:08.813 --> 35:10.413
Knowing it might end badly?

35:10.415 --> 35:12.214
Yes.

35:15.018 --> 35:16.986
Even for one good week.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.222
Okay, if it's bad news,
I'd rather just hear it outright.

35:29.224 --> 35:30.990
You're fine, Shahir.

35:30.992 --> 35:33.326
Your heart rate was elevated
because you were under stress.

35:33.328 --> 35:36.496
And even then,
your heart rhythm was normal.

35:36.498 --> 35:39.765
Look.

35:40.441 --> 35:43.136
- But last night in bed with Jonathan...
- Okay, what exactly was going on

35:43.138 --> 35:44.937
when you had this cardiac event?

35:44.939 --> 35:47.340
I suppose I could draw you a diagram.

35:47.342 --> 35:48.741
No, I mean [chuckles]

35:48.743 --> 35:50.977
was there anything other than sex going on?

35:54.283 --> 35:56.283
He said, "I love you."

35:57.859 --> 35:59.594
And what did you say?

36:00.960 --> 36:02.742
I'm-I'm not feeling well.

36:02.792 --> 36:04.056
Okay, sit.

36:04.448 --> 36:06.024
Come. Sit.

36:08.566 --> 36:10.856
Have you seen anyone since Victor?

36:11.739 --> 36:12.331
No.

36:12.333 --> 36:17.202
Maybe you are just a little out of practice.

36:17.204 --> 36:20.639
You want my advice, as your cardiac surgeon?

36:20.641 --> 36:22.374
Tell Jonathan how you feel.

36:26.646 --> 36:28.580
You are a gorgeous woman, Dr. Bell.

36:28.582 --> 36:29.881
[laughs]

36:29.883 --> 36:32.083
And it's about time a man...
ideally a heterosexual man...

36:32.085 --> 36:33.352
got to appreciate that.

36:36.222 --> 36:37.689
Thanks, Shahir.

36:44.230 --> 36:45.664
[knocking]

36:46.866 --> 36:48.833
Wow.

36:48.835 --> 36:50.835
You look, uh...

37:02.314 --> 37:05.083
â™ª

37:05.085 --> 37:07.952
Maggie. what are you doing?

37:09.002 --> 37:10.421
I know I said
I would give you my support,

37:10.423 --> 37:12.557
but I really don't want
to go to this dinner.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.393
If I have to go, so do you.

37:15.395 --> 37:17.127
Put it on.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.167
Thank you all for coming.

37:23.169 --> 37:24.868
- We are here tonight...
- Good to see you.

37:24.870 --> 37:28.573
To celebrate the inauguration
of a very prestigious award,

37:28.575 --> 37:32.410
an award that was made possible
by the generous donation

37:32.412 --> 37:35.145
of Mrs. Iris Ackermann.

37:35.147 --> 37:37.047
[applause]

37:40.585 --> 37:42.586
Thanks to Mrs. Ackermann,

37:42.588 --> 37:45.488
Hope Zion will be rewarding
its top surgical fellow

37:45.490 --> 37:48.758
with the opportunity to
pursue cutting-edge research,

37:48.760 --> 37:52.362
fully funded, for the next two years.

37:52.364 --> 37:54.731
The surgeons who will be
competing for this award

37:54.733 --> 37:58.435
are Jeffrey Richmond...

37:58.437 --> 38:01.438
Lila Bradley...

38:01.440 --> 38:03.806
Patrick Curtis...

38:03.808 --> 38:05.275
Alex Reid...

38:06.236 --> 38:07.715
- Charles Saipan...
- You two keep it clean out there.

38:07.765 --> 38:08.544
I can't make any promises.

38:08.546 --> 38:10.045
And finally, Maggie Lin.

38:10.047 --> 38:11.647
[applause]

38:11.649 --> 38:13.815
We owe Dawn 50 hours of free overtime.

38:13.817 --> 38:14.983
[chuckles]

38:14.985 --> 38:18.954
Congratulations,
and may the best surgeon win.

38:18.956 --> 38:20.356
Cheers.

38:20.358 --> 38:21.790
You never did answer that question

38:21.792 --> 38:24.326
about that 18-month gap.

38:24.919 --> 38:28.150
I'm not inebriated enough to tell that tale.

38:28.629 --> 38:30.857
Shall we have a few more?

38:30.957 --> 38:33.000
Well, I don't even drink.

38:33.502 --> 38:35.169
Plus, I'm leaving soon anyway.

38:35.171 --> 38:36.237
I have a date.

38:36.239 --> 38:37.805
You move on quickly.

38:37.807 --> 38:40.007
I called Jonathan to make amends.

38:41.265 --> 38:43.244
He's a lucky man, Dr. Hamza.

38:43.246 --> 38:47.748
[folly & the hunter's "breathe" plays]

38:47.750 --> 38:52.452
â™ª in an airless room â™ª

38:56.258 --> 39:01.394
â™ª the menace looms â™ª

39:01.396 --> 39:02.762
Hey.

39:02.764 --> 39:06.266
- â™ª and I'm out of breath â™ª
- I didn't want to disturb you.

39:06.268 --> 39:08.734
I just left you a little something there.

39:08.736 --> 39:12.571
â™ª too soon â™ª

39:12.573 --> 39:14.340
I can't accept this.

39:14.342 --> 39:16.509
It's not a handout, Angelo.
I'm just clearing Joel's debt.

39:16.511 --> 39:18.544
This is way more than 100 bucks.

39:18.546 --> 39:22.048
I added the interest.

39:22.050 --> 39:23.382
What?

39:23.384 --> 39:25.051
I'm a rich prick in a lab coat, remember?

39:25.053 --> 39:26.352
I can afford it.

39:26.354 --> 39:29.422
- â™ª it's alive and well â™ª
- Nah. You're not a prick.

39:29.424 --> 39:31.724
You got a chip on your shoulder, though.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.059
Listen, I don't care how you spend that.

39:34.061 --> 39:37.730
You can blow it all on beer and
aTVs for all I care, but...

39:37.732 --> 39:39.965
- â™ª the self-made hell... â™ª
- You and Joel are square.

39:39.967 --> 39:42.100
What about <i>you</i> and Joel?

39:42.102 --> 39:44.603
â™ª and I'm out of breath â™ª

39:44.605 --> 39:47.105
Hmm.

39:47.107 --> 39:48.374
Get some rest, Angelo.

39:48.376 --> 39:51.276
Hey. Poker game in the
basement next saturday.

39:51.278 --> 39:53.312
â™ª caught within it â™ª

39:53.314 --> 39:55.648
This is a start,
but if I'm thinking law school,

39:55.650 --> 39:58.951
I'm gonna need some more of your money.

39:58.953 --> 40:01.386
- â™ª fear is a prison â™ª
- I said <i>thinking</i> about it.

40:01.388 --> 40:04.923
Get some rest.

40:07.827 --> 40:09.995
[door closes]

40:09.997 --> 40:13.999
We've never competed for
anything before, not directly.

40:14.001 --> 40:16.668
It's not gonna get weird, is it?

40:16.670 --> 40:18.003
I don't know. Let's make a deal.

40:18.005 --> 40:19.670
No matter how hard this year gets,

40:19.672 --> 40:22.173
we won't let it stand in
the way of our friendship.

40:22.175 --> 40:25.176
May the best surgeon win.

40:25.178 --> 40:27.078
It's gonna be me.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.579
- â™ª fear is a prison â™ª
Cassie: - [laughs] I was so nervous.

40:28.581 --> 40:30.119
Cassie.

40:31.150 --> 40:33.517
I-I wasn't expecting you to be here.

40:33.519 --> 40:35.486
I, uh [sighs]

40:35.488 --> 40:36.988
I had this whole speech planned.

40:36.990 --> 40:38.055
[crowd gasp]

40:44.629 --> 40:46.963
You know, this doesn't
look anything like Amy.

40:46.965 --> 40:50.000
You're a liar, Tom.

40:52.169 --> 40:54.337
The average human skull

40:54.339 --> 40:57.508
can withstand 2,100 pounds of compression.

40:57.510 --> 40:59.175
And you want to tell me
that your wife's fracture

40:59.177 --> 41:01.845
was caused by you placing her
on the floor too roughly?

41:01.847 --> 41:05.883
Look, I already told you
what happened, okay?

41:05.885 --> 41:07.583
I came home.

41:07.585 --> 41:09.652
Amy was in the tub under the water.

41:09.654 --> 41:11.854
- I tried to pull her out, and...
- Right.

41:11.856 --> 41:13.222
Look, I was trying everything I could do,

41:13.224 --> 41:15.024
but I couldn't keep her alive.

41:19.463 --> 41:21.363
I was so, uh...

41:23.767 --> 41:25.401
I shook her.

41:31.942 --> 41:33.509
You shook her?

41:36.579 --> 41:38.880
You shook her?

41:42.051 --> 41:44.085
What? Like what?

41:44.087 --> 41:47.322
Like... like this?

41:47.324 --> 41:48.857
Like that?

41:48.859 --> 41:50.391
- Please, Charlie, don't.
- Was it more than once?

41:50.393 --> 41:51.726
- Don't do this.
- Was it more like this?

41:51.728 --> 41:53.962
[thudding] And this? Or this?

41:53.964 --> 41:55.396
This? This?!

41:55.398 --> 41:57.397
Stop it! Stop it!

41:57.399 --> 42:00.468
It wasn't like that!

42:00.470 --> 42:02.937
I spent half of the
marriage on suicide watch.

42:02.939 --> 42:05.840
I-I leave for an hour, and she's gone.

42:05.842 --> 42:07.374
So you were angry.

42:09.210 --> 42:14.047
I know how this makes me look, Charlie...

42:14.049 --> 42:15.749
but I loved her.

42:20.989 --> 42:23.556
I want to believe you, Tom.

42:26.394 --> 42:28.795
So help me.
