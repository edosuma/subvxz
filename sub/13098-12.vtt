WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:04.500
(Ivanova)
'Earthforce ship Omega,
you may proceed to jump gate.'

00:04.583 --> 00:07.917
'Shuttle Copernicus,
you're clear for docking bay 4.'

00:08.000 --> 00:09.667
'Tal'Quith, please hold.'

00:09.750 --> 00:12.000
Earthforce ship,
continue to hold.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.208
Minbari ship, hold.

00:14.292 --> 00:17.167
Babylon 5, this is the captain
of the Tal'Quith.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.500
What is the delay?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.708
Tal'Quith, there's a priority
shipment ahead of you.

00:20.792 --> 00:22.792
However, you'll be able to dock
in 25 minutes.

00:22.875 --> 00:25.708
Unacceptable, we have
a very perishable cargo

00:25.792 --> 00:29.208
for Ambassador G'Kar
and must deliver it immediately.

00:29.292 --> 00:32.917
I'll do what I can.
Please stand by.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.500
Hey, move that over
to the right!

00:35.583 --> 00:37.167
'Over to the right!'

00:37.250 --> 00:39.292
[indistinct chatter]

00:40.625 --> 00:42.000
Delvientos, make it quick.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.250
This is C&amp;C, can you get that

00:43.333 --> 00:44.625
non-transport in here
any quicker?

00:44.708 --> 00:45.958
Where the hell
am I gonna get the crew?

00:46.042 --> 00:47.542
We're already
up to our butts out here.

00:47.625 --> 00:49.625
I understand, but you know
how the Narns can be.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.125
(Delvientos)
'Yeah, I know.'

00:51.208 --> 00:53.833
'You're really busting
my cojones today, C&amp;C.'

00:53.917 --> 00:56.458
Slide her into bay 8,
then we'll see what we can do.

00:56.542 --> 00:57.917
Thanks.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.042
Tal'Quith, you may proceed
immediately to docking bay 8

01:01.125 --> 01:02.958
via Beacon Alpha 6.

01:03.042 --> 01:05.250
About time.

01:05.333 --> 01:08.375
[intense music]

01:15.583 --> 01:18.292
[alarm blaring]

01:18.375 --> 01:21.250
Oh, we have a failure
in the bay 6 docking computer.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.750
It's raising the transport.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.167
[automated message]
'Platform 6 activated.'

01:25.250 --> 01:27.667
'Departure sequence engaged.'

01:27.750 --> 01:29.792
'Collision warning.'

01:29.875 --> 01:31.458
It's going to collide
with a Narn ship.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.833
Computer, override
docking sequence 6 Gamma 6-0.

01:33.917 --> 01:36.000
'Tal'Quith, I'm switching you
to Beacon Zeta.'

01:36.083 --> 01:38.333
'Stand by. Do not attempt
to alter your course.'

01:38.417 --> 01:41.458
[music continues]

01:43.208 --> 01:46.167
Halt all transport.
Do not start your engines.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.250
[crashing]

01:53.750 --> 01:55.083
Le's go, let's go, let's go!

01:55.167 --> 01:56.583
Bay 6, damage report.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.125
Hydraulic and fuel lines in
the lobbying area are ruptured!

01:59.208 --> 02:01.708
Seal off the entire section.
Swift team is on its way.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.208
Well, tell them to hurry up,
I've got

02:03.292 --> 02:04.500
two people trapped in there,
if we don't

02:04.583 --> 02:07.542
get them out fast,
they're dead!

02:07.625 --> 02:11.208
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

02:11.292 --> 02:14.625
ten years
after the Earth-Minbari war.

02:14.708 --> 02:18.083
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:18.167 --> 02:20.083
Its goal,
to prevent another war

02:20.167 --> 02:22.625
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

02:22.708 --> 02:25.375
could work out
their differences peacefully.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.417
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:28.500 --> 02:30.292
for diplomats, hustlers

02:30.375 --> 02:33.417
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.792
Humans and aliens wrapped
in 2,500,000 tons

02:37.875 --> 02:39.792
of spinning metal

02:39.875 --> 02:42.875
all alone in the night.

02:42.958 --> 02:45.208
It can be a dangerous place

02:45.292 --> 02:48.458
but it's our last, best hope
for peace.

02:48.542 --> 02:52.417
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.958
The year is 2258.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.542
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

02:58.625 --> 03:01.667
[theme music]

03:27.792 --> 03:30.875
[music continues]

03:38.125 --> 03:39.792
- Get up here quick.
- Come on.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.000
Look, there's still a chance
of a spontaneous combustion

03:42.083 --> 03:44.000
in there, so we're opening
the airlocks just long enough

03:44.083 --> 03:46.458
for you guys to get in
and get out, okay?

03:46.542 --> 03:47.875
- Alright.
- Alright.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.667
Open up.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.417
- Clear.
- Go, go, go, go.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.625
- Let's go!
- Right with you.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.917
[alarm blaring]

04:02.833 --> 04:05.000
Hey, get somebody over here.

04:08.250 --> 04:10.292
We got vitals.
Let's get him out of here.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.625
Who do we have trapped in there?

04:11.708 --> 04:14.250
All I know is
it's two members of Team 21.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.083
What?

04:16.167 --> 04:18.333
[alarm blaring]

04:18.417 --> 04:21.375
Delvientos, open it up.
We're coming out.

04:21.458 --> 04:23.667
Okay, they're coming. Back off.

04:26.792 --> 04:29.042
[indistinct chatter]

04:30.500 --> 04:32.292
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.667
[fire blazing]

04:36.750 --> 04:38.667
[indistinct chatter]

04:38.750 --> 04:41.000
- Go down.
- Okay, over here, over here.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.000
[indistinct chatter]

04:43.083 --> 04:44.958
He's dead.

04:45.042 --> 04:47.500
(Delvientos)
'Alberto, my brother.'

04:49.125 --> 04:50.292
Bendito.

04:52.708 --> 04:55.417
Hermanito, dios mio.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.625
[singing in foreign language]

05:09.958 --> 05:12.417
To you I give the grain

05:12.500 --> 05:15.958
the light and the sky.

05:16.042 --> 05:19.542
To you, a sacred heritage.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.708
To you, the land and sea.

05:23.875 --> 05:27.000
[singing in foreign language]

05:35.667 --> 05:38.083
[beeping]

05:38.167 --> 05:40.042
(Na'Toth)
'Ambassador?'

05:40.125 --> 05:42.958
So spoke G'Quan
at the dawn of all mornings.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.500
(Na'Toth)
'Ambassador?'

05:48.250 --> 05:49.667
(G'Kar)
'Enter.'

05:52.167 --> 05:54.750
I'm sorry to disturb you
at this time, ambassador

05:54.833 --> 05:57.708
but I bring unhappy news.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.917
There's been an accident
on one of our cargo ships.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.417
- What?
- The Tal'Quith.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.333
Was there much damage?

06:04.417 --> 06:06.958
The entire cargo bay
was blown out.

06:07.042 --> 06:11.292
I'm afraid the G'Quan Eth
was destroyed in the accident.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.542
No.

06:15.667 --> 06:19.417
No. Oh, no.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.458
Don't try to blame my people
for this.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.625
We have said all along
that the dockside equipment

06:25.708 --> 06:27.958
isn't up to handling
the amount of traffic we get.

06:28.042 --> 06:29.958
The computer malfunction
might have been caused

06:30.042 --> 06:31.000
by operator error.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.042
Even if that were true

06:33.125 --> 06:34.792
what do you expect?

06:34.875 --> 06:36.542
My people have been forced
to work triple shifts

06:36.625 --> 06:39.125
because we are understaffed
in every area.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.292
Ms. Connally, we're not here
to assign blame.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.792
Maybe you aren't, commander,
but my government will want

06:43.875 --> 06:46.292
to know who is responsible
for damaging our ship.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.958
Then I suggest you start
with your ship's captain

06:48.042 --> 06:49.458
who panicked
and fired his engines

06:49.542 --> 06:51.625
inside the docking bay
against my direct orders!

06:51.708 --> 06:54.375
Now don't try to blame this
on us, lieutenant commander.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.792
We are the victims here.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.583
You lost some cargo, ambassador.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.708
Alberto Delvientos
lost his life.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.375
Yes, a tragedy, to be sure.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.333
But what was our captain to do?

07:08.417 --> 07:09.875
His ship was placed in jeopardy

07:09.958 --> 07:12.167
through no fault of his own,
and he reacted.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.833
And by G'Quan, I mean to see

07:13.917 --> 07:15.667
that we're compensated
for the damage.

07:15.750 --> 07:19.167
Now if you'll excuse me, I must
attend to a pressing matter.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.000
The accident was caused
by equipment failure.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.500
'A cluster of defective
microchips blew out.'

07:28.583 --> 07:29.917
- How is that possible?
- Looks like..

07:30.000 --> 07:31.833
The contractors installed
substandard chips

07:31.917 --> 07:33.250
throughout the entire system,
that would

07:33.333 --> 07:34.792
'explain how they managed
such a low bid'

07:34.875 --> 07:37.458
on the installation.
We're checking it all now.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.292
This is going to play havoc
with our schedule.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.375
(Sinclair)
'Ivanova, how long before'

07:40.458 --> 07:42.375
'we can get bay 6 online?'

07:42.458 --> 07:43.958
Several hours at least,
we're gonna have

07:44.042 --> 07:45.875
to reroute the controls
with the other docking bays

07:45.958 --> 07:47.208
until new chips
can be installed.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.750
The problems dockside
run much deeper

07:49.833 --> 07:53.208
than a few microchips,
commander.

07:53.292 --> 07:55.333
I'm aware of that, Ms. Connally

07:55.417 --> 07:57.792
and I've done everything I can
to make the senate understand

07:57.875 --> 08:00.500
we need an increase
in the station's budget.

08:01.958 --> 08:03.333
- I just hope they listen.
- You mean..

08:03.417 --> 08:05.500
Before someone else gets killed?

08:08.958 --> 08:11.167
[beeps]

08:11.250 --> 08:12.958
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

08:13.042 --> 08:15.417
(female #1)
'Senator Hidoshi's
on Gold Channel for you.'

08:15.500 --> 08:17.708
'It's about the new budget.'

08:17.792 --> 08:19.458
On our way.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.208
And you don't know of anyone
who has one?

08:26.292 --> 08:29.583
- I'll pay any price.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

08:31.750 --> 08:36.083
Ah, G'Kar. Doing
a little shopping, are you?

08:36.167 --> 08:40.458
[clicks tongue]
Is that permitted
during the holy days of G'Quan?

08:40.542 --> 08:42.250
It's no concern of yours,
Mollari.

08:42.333 --> 08:46.667
[laughs]
I heard about the mishap
involving your transport.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.375
Shocking, truly shocking.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.292
If there is anything I can do
to be of assistance

08:52.375 --> 08:55.167
you will let me know, yes?

08:55.250 --> 08:56.583
No.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.792
There's no one
who can have a G'Quan Eth

09:02.875 --> 09:04.458
delivered in time
for the ceremony.

09:04.542 --> 09:06.792
- Swock.
- However..

09:06.875 --> 09:09.292
According to import records,
there is one being

09:09.375 --> 09:11.333
on the station
who has the flower.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.917
Well, who is it?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.708
- Ambassador Mollari.
- What?

09:14.792 --> 09:15.875
Yoo-hoo.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.417
[laughs]

09:18.500 --> 09:20.042
[grunts]

09:20.125 --> 09:23.333
Ah, why does the universe
hate me?

09:24.833 --> 09:27.042
It's all in the budget report,
commander.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.875
I know what's in the reports,
senator, but we need

09:28.958 --> 09:31.708
those increases in station
operations. Promises were made.

09:31.792 --> 09:34.167
Political realities
sometimes take precedence

09:34.250 --> 09:35.667
over good intentions.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.500
If President Santiago
can turn things around

09:38.583 --> 09:42.167
at that time you may receive
some of the money you requested.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.000
We have operational
and safety concerns

09:44.083 --> 09:45.500
that won't wait
for the government to turn

09:45.583 --> 09:47.083
things around. There's
already been an accident.

09:47.167 --> 09:49.417
Accidents happen,
but our experts

09:49.500 --> 09:51.500
have assured us
that your new budget

09:51.583 --> 09:54.292
is more than sufficient
for safe and efficient running

09:54.375 --> 09:56.292
of Babylon 5.

09:56.375 --> 09:59.292
Commander,
I have every confidence

09:59.375 --> 10:01.917
that you will make it work.

10:05.083 --> 10:09.000
I assume the news about
the budget has leaked by now.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.167
The station business channel
is running a detailed analysis.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.500
Wonderful, we'll need
to set up meetings

10:14.583 --> 10:16.167
with the business council
and the guilds.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.167
And I better have a separate
meeting with Ms. Connally.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.833
She'll be spitting neutrons.
The dock workers got zip.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.625
No pay raise,
no money for new workers

10:22.708 --> 10:24.167
no funds
for upgrading equipment.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.500
As far as the senate's concerned

10:25.583 --> 10:27.125
they're bound
by a government contract.

10:27.208 --> 10:28.875
They can't quit
and they can't go on strike.

10:28.958 --> 10:29.875
Why give them anything?

10:29.958 --> 10:32.292
Commander, we've got a problem.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.125
Surprise, surprise.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.250
We're up to our eyeballs
in waiting transport

10:38.333 --> 10:40.375
and the dock workers
are calling in sick.

10:40.458 --> 10:41.458
- How serious is it?
- Well..

10:41.542 --> 10:42.458
As far as we can determine

10:42.542 --> 10:43.542
none of them are actually ill.

10:43.625 --> 10:44.875
They're just calling in sick.

10:44.958 --> 10:46.583
- Sounds like the blue flu.
- Excuse me?

10:46.667 --> 10:48.875
My grandmother was a Boston cop,
I remember her telling me

10:48.958 --> 10:50.458
about the blue flu,
they used to use it

10:50.542 --> 10:52.208
to get around sanctions
on work stoppages.

10:52.292 --> 10:56.250
In other words, we have
an illegal strike on our hands.

11:00.542 --> 11:01.958
(Ivanova)
'This is Babylon Control,
our docking schedule'

11:02.042 --> 11:03.833
'is being revised.
Please stand by.'

11:07.125 --> 11:09.208
How much more of this
they expect us to take?

11:09.292 --> 11:11.958
We need a ten-hour turnaround
after we work a double shift!

11:12.042 --> 11:14.667
- Yeah.
- You're lucky if you get four.

11:14.750 --> 11:17.500
- Yeah!
- You're lucky if you get any!

11:17.583 --> 11:19.625
We're breaking safety rules
every minute of the day

11:19.708 --> 11:21.083
because of over-scheduling.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.000
- Yeah!
- I say strike!

11:24.083 --> 11:28.208
(all)
Strike! Strike! Strike!

11:28.292 --> 11:29.792
Alright, knock it off!

11:29.875 --> 11:31.750
(all)
Strike! Strike! Strike!

11:31.833 --> 11:35.958
Knock it off! Stop it!

11:36.042 --> 11:37.583
Now first of all,
I don't wanna

11:37.667 --> 11:40.500
hear the word strike anymore!

11:40.583 --> 11:42.708
We will hear everyone out,
but let's take this

11:42.792 --> 11:46.083
one issue at a time, okay?

11:46.167 --> 11:48.792
'Now let's remember,
let's try to keep a cool head'

11:48.875 --> 11:51.000
during management negotiation.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.375
[indistinct chatter]

11:52.458 --> 11:54.958
What do you want here?

11:55.042 --> 11:56.917
Getting out of my way
would be a start.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.500
It's alright, Eduardo.
Let him through.

12:00.583 --> 12:03.292
(male #1)
'Yeah. Come on.'

12:03.375 --> 12:04.667
'What do you got to say, huh?'

12:04.750 --> 12:07.583
[indistinct chatter]

12:07.667 --> 12:09.333
- 'Yeah.'
- 'What do you want, Garibaldi?'

12:09.417 --> 12:11.917
I've been expecting you,
Garibaldi.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.625
I'm here to escort you
to Commander Sinclair.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.625
He's requested the honor
of your presence.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.833
Twice. Maybe you didn't get
the message.

12:17.917 --> 12:20.917
I've been tied up. I got
a lot of sick workers here.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.583
[workers laughing]

12:22.667 --> 12:25.708
[workers coughing]

12:28.750 --> 12:32.417
You think this is funny, huh?
Well, I don't.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.458
We're as serious
as a rip in a spacesuit.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.958
And we want the senate and
Commander Sinclair to know it.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.458
By staging an illegal strike?

12:38.542 --> 12:39.833
I thought you were smarter
than that.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.792
Sinclair and Ivanova
are career military.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.625
I don't expect them
to understand

12:43.708 --> 12:46.833
but I figure you for blue collar
under all that Earthforce gray.

12:46.917 --> 12:49.625
You must know we're only doing
what we have to do.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.833
I know how you feel,
but this isn't the way.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.792
And what other options
do we have, Mr. Garibaldi?

12:53.875 --> 12:56.292
That's what the commander
wants to talk to you about.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.708
The hell with your talk.

12:57.792 --> 13:01.083
We got people dying out here,
Mr. Security Man

13:01.167 --> 13:03.083
and Sinclair wants us to talk.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.333
What does he think we are?
Fools?

13:05.417 --> 13:09.500
Alright, alright.
Let me handle this, alright?

13:09.583 --> 13:13.542
Okay? Okay, your commander
wants to talk, we'll talk.

13:14.292 --> 13:15.208
Let's go.

13:15.292 --> 13:17.208
[indistinct yelling]

13:17.292 --> 13:18.667
Your friend's
looking for a fight.

13:18.750 --> 13:21.083
That was Eduardo Delvientos,
his little brother Alberto

13:21.167 --> 13:22.583
was the one who was killed
in the accident.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.375
- He's taking it hard.
- I'm sorry.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.042
I know what it's like
to lose someone close

13:26.125 --> 13:28.417
and so does the commander.
He wants to help, Neeoma.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.833
We'll see.

13:33.292 --> 13:35.250
I'm asking your people
to go back to work.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.458
If they don't,
I'll have to bring

13:36.542 --> 13:37.708
the Senate Labor Committee
in on this

13:37.792 --> 13:39.000
and they could invoke
the Rush Act.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.417
They don't have the guts
to do that.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.542
It would inflame public opinion

13:41.625 --> 13:42.583
here and at home.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.833
Don't be so sure about that.

13:43.917 --> 13:44.875
Things are changing on Earth

13:44.958 --> 13:47.000
and not all for the best.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.542
Look, you've made your point

13:48.625 --> 13:51.000
and Earth Central will be made
aware of your grievances.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.583
There's nothing else
you can gain by continuing--

13:52.667 --> 13:56.125
I can't send my people back
to work without some guarantees.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.417
And I can't guarantee anything

13:57.500 --> 13:59.083
while you're on strike.
If you just trust--

13:59.167 --> 14:00.875
It's the senate who controls
the money, commander.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.042
Every time we trust them,
we get kicked in the teeth.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.208
And what happens if your people
start kicking back, huh?

14:05.292 --> 14:06.583
If you force them
into a confrontation--

14:06.667 --> 14:08.542
We won't be the first
to use violence.

14:08.625 --> 14:11.250
I saw what went down in
the docking bay. They're angry--

14:11.333 --> 14:12.708
They've got a right to be angry!

14:12.792 --> 14:15.208
They've also got a right to hear
what I've just told you.

14:15.292 --> 14:17.917
They will, but I can't
recommend they return to work.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.667
I don't think you fully
understand the consequences--

14:19.750 --> 14:22.000
Don't tell me
about consequences.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.250
My father was shot dead during

14:23.333 --> 14:25.083
the 37 mining strikes
on Ganymede.

14:25.167 --> 14:27.417
I have spent my entire life
defending workers' rights

14:27.500 --> 14:29.083
and I'm not about to stop now.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.750
(Neeoma)
'You get us decent pay
and equipment'

14:30.833 --> 14:33.000
'and hire enough workers
to do the job safely'

14:33.083 --> 14:36.042
then we return to work,
not a minute before.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.167
[beeps]

14:42.250 --> 14:43.750
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

14:43.833 --> 14:45.125
(female #1)
'You've got
another transmission'

14:45.208 --> 14:47.208
'from Senator Hidoshi.'

14:49.375 --> 14:50.833
Patch it through.

14:51.708 --> 14:54.000
[humming]

14:55.083 --> 14:56.250
Hm.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.083
[humming]

15:02.000 --> 15:04.208
You left your door unlocked,
ambassador.

15:04.292 --> 15:05.958
Careless of you.

15:06.042 --> 15:07.292
I thought it best to sit here

15:07.375 --> 15:10.958
and guard your room
until you returned.

15:11.042 --> 15:13.625
And did you find
anything of interest

15:13.708 --> 15:17.917
in my humble quarters
while you were guarding it?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.333
- No.
- 'No.'

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Care for a drink?

15:24.083 --> 15:26.167
(Mollari)
'Oh, I forgot.'

15:26.250 --> 15:29.083
'The days of G'Quan forbid it.'

15:29.167 --> 15:32.875
But they come to a close
very soon.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.750
Do they not? Heh-heh.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.375
You know why I'm here.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.667
The G'Quan Eth plant, yes?

15:40.750 --> 15:42.375
Difficult to grow

15:42.458 --> 15:45.125
expensive to transport

15:45.208 --> 15:47.083
very expensive to own

15:47.167 --> 15:51.500
but so very important to you

15:51.583 --> 15:53.667
at this festive time.

15:53.750 --> 15:58.167
I understand you are
in possession of G'Quan Eth.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.667
If this is so, I am here to..

16:02.458 --> 16:04.000
...purchase it from you.

16:04.083 --> 16:07.208
Ever since we left
your beautiful planet

16:07.292 --> 16:11.250
G'Quan Eth plants
have been hard to find.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.542
Mine

16:13.625 --> 16:16.917
which is being cared for
in a safe place

16:17.000 --> 16:21.125
'I have been saving
for a special occasion.'

16:21.208 --> 16:23.250
When you drop the seeds

16:23.333 --> 16:25.667
into a proper mixture
of alcohol..

16:25.750 --> 16:27.833
[laughs]

16:27.917 --> 16:30.042
[grunts]

16:30.125 --> 16:32.417
...whole new universes open up.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.125
[chuckles]

16:35.208 --> 16:39.417
It's a shame you Narns waste
them burning them as incense.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.875
Name your price.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.417
Oh, you're asking
for quite a sacrifice from me

16:44.500 --> 16:48.417
but in the interest
of interstellar peace

16:48.500 --> 16:52.833
and friendship, um..

16:54.417 --> 16:57.833
...50,000 commercial credits
in cash in advance.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.083
- That's an outrage!
- Ah.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.750
Of course, it's an outrage.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.458
The question is how important

17:03.542 --> 17:06.167
is your religious ceremony
to you?

17:06.250 --> 17:09.250
[laughing]

17:11.333 --> 17:13.917
Commander,
we have been hearing reports

17:14.000 --> 17:17.958
of an illegal strike
by your Dockers' Guild.

17:18.042 --> 17:19.708
Those reports are exaggerated,
senator.

17:19.792 --> 17:22.583
We do have a problem, but I've
been going over the new budget--

17:22.667 --> 17:26.625
This action threatens the
security of our military base

17:26.708 --> 17:30.083
and sets a bad precedent,
not only for Babylon 5

17:30.167 --> 17:32.833
but for all
of our off-world interests.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.792
We cannot allow that.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.125
The Dockers' Guild
has legitimate grievances.

17:37.208 --> 17:40.625
- I can't just ignore them.
- You will not have to.

17:40.708 --> 17:44.500
The labor committee has ordered
Orin Zento to Babylon 5.

17:44.583 --> 17:47.792
He will be there
within 12 hours.

17:47.875 --> 17:48.958
Zento?

17:49.042 --> 17:51.833
He is our best labor negotiator.

17:51.917 --> 17:53.375
He has stopped
this kind of thing before

17:53.458 --> 17:55.625
on many of our stations.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.833
I expect you to give him
your full cooperation

17:58.917 --> 18:01.292
and that includes
providing troops

18:01.375 --> 18:04.792
if he decides
the Rush Act is necessary.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.583
You're not serious?

18:06.667 --> 18:09.333
We have over a thousand
dock workers on this station.

18:09.417 --> 18:12.375
If we start arresting them, we
could have a riot on our hands.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.625
The more reason
to end this thing decisively

18:15.708 --> 18:17.500
before it spreads.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.000
Understood, commander?

18:22.750 --> 18:25.833
Understood, senator.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.542
[indistinct chatter]

18:31.625 --> 18:33.958
- Mr. Zento. This way.
- Commander Sinclair.

18:34.042 --> 18:36.042
I was told there was an accident
on the docks recently.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.167
Not serious, I hope.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.958
One worker killed,
several more injured.

18:39.042 --> 18:40.458
And the Narns
are demanding reparation

18:40.542 --> 18:42.083
for damage
to their ship and cargo.

18:42.167 --> 18:43.667
I hope in spite of that
we'll be able

18:43.750 --> 18:46.667
to expedite negotiations.
I'm on a tight schedule.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.875
When can I meet
with this Connally?

18:47.958 --> 18:49.083
It's being arranged.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.667
I'll need to talk to
your security chief.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.500
If I have to invoke the
Rush Act, it's best to be ready.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.583
Have Mr. Garibaldi
report to briefing room 3.

18:57.292 --> 18:58.208
[humming]

18:58.292 --> 18:59.292
[computer beeping]

18:59.375 --> 19:00.500
Yes?

19:00.583 --> 19:04.500
Ambassador Mollari,
I have the money.

19:04.583 --> 19:08.875
Fifty thousand credits in cash.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.875
Where is the G'Quan Eth?

19:10.958 --> 19:15.167
Actually, G'Kar,
I have changed my mind.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.250
(Mollari)
'The G'Quan Eth plant
is not for sale.'

19:18.333 --> 19:19.208
What?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.417
I have also changed

19:20.500 --> 19:21.542
my lock code.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.750
'So don't bother visiting me.'

19:23.833 --> 19:25.875
Consider this a small

19:25.958 --> 19:28.958
a very tiny portion of revenge

19:29.042 --> 19:32.083
for what you did to our colony
on Ragesh III

19:32.167 --> 19:33.750
'and to my nephew.'

19:33.833 --> 19:36.250
'Did you think
that I had forgotten that?'

19:36.333 --> 19:41.125
Ambassador,
enjoy the last few hours

19:41.208 --> 19:43.417
of your festive holiday.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.250
I know I will.

19:45.333 --> 19:48.708
I'll kill him
with my bare hands, by my..

19:48.792 --> 19:50.417
There's nothing to stop me!

19:50.500 --> 19:52.833
Sinclair can only kick me
off the station!

19:52.917 --> 19:55.208
He might even thank me.

19:58.417 --> 20:00.083
[sighs]

20:02.167 --> 20:04.958
You're not a follower of G'Quan,
are you, Na'Toth?

20:05.042 --> 20:08.042
My father was a disciple
of G'Lan.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.833
My mother didn't believe
in much of anything.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.292
And what do you believe in?

20:11.375 --> 20:14.833
- Myself, ambassador.
- Too easy an answer.

20:14.917 --> 20:18.750
We all believe in something
greater than ourselves

20:18.833 --> 20:21.625
even if it's just
the blind forces of chance.

20:21.708 --> 20:24.417
Chance favors the warrior.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.750
Isn't there anything you can do

20:25.833 --> 20:27.750
to get a G'Quan Eth
before the deadline?

20:27.833 --> 20:31.417
Only one more thing,
and I hate having to do it

20:31.500 --> 20:33.833
but if that should fail

20:33.917 --> 20:36.667
there's something
I want you to do.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.292
At your service, ambassador.

20:39.375 --> 20:43.792
I assure you, your guild
is not being singled out.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.833
Earth sympathizes
with your situation.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.958
[indistinct chatter]

20:49.042 --> 20:53.583
I, personally,
understand your feelings.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.292
But the government
must cut costs.

20:56.375 --> 20:59.375
We're in a recession,
everyone's feeling the pinch

20:59.458 --> 21:00.750
at home,
as well as in our colonies--

21:00.833 --> 21:02.167
The government
found enough money

21:02.250 --> 21:04.833
for increased military spending
on Babylon 5.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.500
[indistinct chatter]

21:06.583 --> 21:09.292
Babylon 5
is a military installation

21:09.375 --> 21:12.250
in the midst
of hostile alien governments.

21:12.333 --> 21:15.375
It is vital
to the defense of Earth.

21:15.458 --> 21:20.042
And your guild
is a vital part of Babylon 5.

21:20.125 --> 21:23.500
Now, the new budget provides
everyone with enough funds

21:23.583 --> 21:26.167
to run their departments
efficiently.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.083
We've cut away the fat, yes

21:30.167 --> 21:32.083
but we've left
the muscle and bone.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.083
I think we know
where the fat went.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.708
[laughing]

21:36.958 --> 21:40.708
- Ms. Connally.
- Mr. Zento, you're right.

21:40.792 --> 21:42.875
My people are a part
of Babylon 5.

21:42.958 --> 21:44.792
They unload the goods
to keep it running.

21:44.875 --> 21:46.208
(Neeoma)
'A lot of them
even helped build it.'

21:46.292 --> 21:47.625
What do they get for it?

21:47.708 --> 21:49.000
They work
double and triple shifts

21:49.083 --> 21:50.583
using equipment
that is substandard

21:50.667 --> 21:52.042
for pay that's a joke.

21:52.125 --> 21:54.667
[indistinct chatter]

21:54.750 --> 21:56.792
You signed a contract,
Ms. Connally

21:56.875 --> 21:59.375
just like every other government
worker on this station.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.708
Abide by it, and we'll look
into these problems.

22:01.792 --> 22:05.583
These problems killed a man,
Mr. Zento, a damn good man.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.750
And as the duly-elected
representative of this guild

22:07.833 --> 22:09.875
I don't intend
to let that happen again.

22:09.958 --> 22:13.208
We were promised an increase
by last year's negotiator.

22:13.292 --> 22:14.875
[indistinct chatter]

22:15.000 --> 22:16.417
I wish I could help

22:16.500 --> 22:18.750
but I've seen no written
agreement to that effect.

22:18.833 --> 22:21.458
Without that, my hands are tied.

22:21.542 --> 22:24.542
(Zento)
'There are simply
no funds available.'

22:24.625 --> 22:27.750
Now, despite
this unfortunate accident

22:27.833 --> 22:31.750
our experts assure us you have
enough people for this year

22:31.833 --> 22:33.000
and that your equipment
is quite sufficient--

22:33.083 --> 22:34.958
How many of those, uh, experts

22:35.042 --> 22:36.958
ever worked a space dock?

22:37.042 --> 22:38.083
How many of them have ever tried

22:38.167 --> 22:39.833
to refuel a ship
while being pushed

22:39.917 --> 22:42.417
to move faster and faster
because of over-scheduling?

22:42.500 --> 22:44.083
Or felt the pain in their bones

22:44.167 --> 22:46.750
from operating a Zero-G
cargo loader for nine hours?

22:46.833 --> 22:48.292
[indistinct chatter]

22:48.375 --> 22:49.792
You have a point, Mr...

22:49.875 --> 22:52.833
Mr. Eduardo Delvientos,
senior foreman.

22:52.917 --> 22:55.042
And, yeah, I got a point.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.167
I've been working space docks
for 40 years.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.833
And this equipment we got
won't last two months

22:59.917 --> 23:01.208
let alone two years.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.833
Every piece
needs to be overhauled

23:02.917 --> 23:05.167
but we don't have the money
or the manpower to do it.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.083
And if you won't do
nothing about it

23:07.167 --> 23:09.458
you can damn well get
your experts to run those docks.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.875
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.667
If that's your response

23:13.750 --> 23:16.250
you leave me no choice
but to invoke the Rush Act.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.792
[clamoring]

23:17.875 --> 23:19.167
Is that what you want..

23:19.250 --> 23:20.250
[clamoring]

23:20.333 --> 23:21.833
Do it!

23:21.917 --> 23:24.125
I suggest

23:24.208 --> 23:25.667
we recess for the evening.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.625
It's late and we're all tired.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.958
It's not a good time
for big decisions.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.333
You're right, commander.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.625
Ms. Connally,
perhaps we'll have better luck

23:33.708 --> 23:36.583
'ironing this out
at a private meeting tomorrow.'

23:36.667 --> 23:38.542
Shall we say 7:00?

23:39.750 --> 23:41.292
[indistinct chatter]

23:41.375 --> 23:42.917
He's bluffing.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.375
The senate hasn't invoked
the Rush Act

23:44.458 --> 23:45.583
since the Europa strike.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.833
Don't count on that,
Ms. Connally.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.833
I told you things are changing.

23:49.917 --> 23:51.958
One thing hasn't changed.

23:52.042 --> 23:54.000
Workers always get shafted.

23:54.083 --> 23:55.375
But this time
we're gonna fight back.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.750
Eduardo, we have to keep cool.

23:56.833 --> 23:58.958
If we don't, we're finished here
and back on Earth.

23:59.042 --> 24:00.833
We have a right
to defend ourselves, Neeoma.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.333
But not with violence.

24:03.417 --> 24:05.167
Beg your pardon, commander

24:05.250 --> 24:07.875
but if someone's pushed you,
wouldn't you push back?

24:12.458 --> 24:16.000
I hope we make more progress
tomorrow, Ms. Connally.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.292
You better tell that to Zento.

24:23.625 --> 24:25.833
(male #2)
'Cargo ship Seattle,
please be patient.'

24:25.917 --> 24:27.792
'You are next on the schedule.'

24:33.250 --> 24:35.208
Computer, what time is it?

24:35.292 --> 24:37.875
(computer)
'05:36.'

24:39.042 --> 24:39.958
[computer rings]

24:40.042 --> 24:41.000
- Yes?
- Commander.

24:41.083 --> 24:42.417
What the hell is going on?

24:42.500 --> 24:44.042
Word's all over the station
the Dockers' Guild

24:44.125 --> 24:45.917
has dropped
their blue-flu story.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.667
They've officially declared
there's a strike.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.875
Damn.

24:50.958 --> 24:53.792
Mr. Zento,
I'm sure this is just a rumor.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.208
If you'll give me some time--

24:55.292 --> 24:56.375
Don't play games with me

24:56.458 --> 24:58.917
Sinclair, I know all about you.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.667
'You've let this situation
escalate out of all proportion'

25:01.750 --> 25:04.250
and you can bet the senate's
going to get a full report.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.917
We've got trade contracts
to honor.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.667
We're talking
about people's lives.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.125
Spare me the platitudes,
commander.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.833
I'll meet with Ms. Connally
at 7:00 as planned

25:12.917 --> 25:15.250
but if she persists
in this illegal action

25:15.333 --> 25:17.083
the Rush Act
will be put into force

25:17.167 --> 25:20.042
and your troops had better
be ready to enforce it.

25:22.833 --> 25:24.083
[computer ringing]

25:24.167 --> 25:25.750
Now what?

25:26.500 --> 25:27.833
Yes?

25:27.917 --> 25:30.542
Commander Sinclair,
I must speak to you immediately

25:30.625 --> 25:32.417
on a matter
of the gravest importance.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.625
Ambassador G'Kar, I have

25:33.708 --> 25:35.750
an emergency situation
on my hands.

25:35.833 --> 25:37.333
It won't take long

25:37.417 --> 25:38.917
and I wouldn't want
to burden you further

25:39.000 --> 25:42.042
by taking this matter up
before a full assembly.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.625
Alright.

25:44.708 --> 25:47.500
I'll meet you
in the council chambers.

25:47.583 --> 25:50.833
(Ivanova)
'All ships, please stand by.
All docking bays are full.'

25:52.417 --> 25:54.292
Are you telling me
this is about a flower?

25:54.375 --> 25:58.417
Not just a flower, commander.
The very symbol of my faith.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.042
All followers of G'Quan must
perform a ritual once a year

26:02.125 --> 26:05.875
when our sun rises precisely
behind the G'Quan Mountain.

26:05.958 --> 26:07.500
Each year
the celebrant must acquire

26:07.583 --> 26:08.917
a new plant for the ceremony.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.167
Well, I had made
all the arrangements.

26:10.250 --> 26:11.667
It should have been here
months ago

26:11.750 --> 26:14.208
but you know
how bureaucracies are and..

26:14.292 --> 26:16.417
Well, this must all
sound ridiculous to you.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.792
No, it doesn't, ambassador

26:17.875 --> 26:20.625
but we'll have to talk
about this some other time.

26:20.708 --> 26:23.625
Commander,
there is no other time.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.458
You see, those who are able,
perform the ritual

26:25.542 --> 26:28.375
in the first rays of sunlight
that shine past the mountain

26:28.458 --> 26:30.042
a magnificent sight.

26:30.125 --> 26:32.417
Those of us who can't be there
must still perform the ritual

26:32.500 --> 26:35.542
at the same moment, a moment
which is almost upon us.

26:35.625 --> 26:38.083
It is the most important
observance of my beliefs

26:38.167 --> 26:40.333
and it requires the G'Quan Eth

26:40.417 --> 26:42.208
which as the highest-ranking
member of my faith

26:42.292 --> 26:45.333
on this station, it is
my responsibility to provide.

26:45.417 --> 26:47.000
And I truly sympathize
with you, G'Kar

26:47.083 --> 26:49.333
but it's Londo's flower
to do with as he likes.

26:49.417 --> 26:51.667
It's sacrilege for him
to possess it.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.792
It was stolen from our planet.

26:53.875 --> 26:56.333
I'll make a major incident
out of this, commander.

26:56.417 --> 26:58.333
I don't like threats, ambassador

26:58.417 --> 27:00.500
but I'll do what I can.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.417
[intense music]

27:04.542 --> 27:07.583
Look, I can't force you
to do this

27:07.667 --> 27:09.333
but in the name
of interstellar goodwill

27:09.417 --> 27:11.917
not to mention
peace and quiet on this station

27:12.000 --> 27:13.208
I'm asking.

27:13.292 --> 27:15.208
You know
I would do anything for you

27:15.292 --> 27:18.250
my good friend
Commander Sinclair

27:18.333 --> 27:19.875
but not this.

27:19.958 --> 27:22.208
You don't have to give him
the G'Quan Eth as a gift.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.167
He's agreed to pay
a rather steep price for it.

27:24.250 --> 27:28.292
This isn't about money,
commander, or spiritual beliefs.

27:28.375 --> 27:32.208
G'Kar is only worried
about losing face.

27:32.292 --> 27:34.792
The Narns. Ugh.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.208
They're a barbaric people.

27:37.292 --> 27:39.042
They're all pagans.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.542
Still worshipping their sun.

27:41.625 --> 27:45.000
No, I would rather burn
the plant than give it to him.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.375
[sighs]
Would you at least consider it?

27:49.458 --> 27:50.667
No.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.250
[door whirring]

27:56.333 --> 27:58.000
- Well?
- I'm sorry.

27:58.083 --> 27:59.083
But, commander..

27:59.167 --> 28:00.083
[beeping]

28:00.167 --> 28:01.708
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

28:01.792 --> 28:03.000
(female #1)
'You're wanted
in the briefing room.'

28:03.083 --> 28:05.708
- 'Immediately.'
- On my way.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.875
Uh..

28:12.458 --> 28:13.375
[beeps]

28:13.458 --> 28:16.583
Na'Toth, proceed.

28:16.667 --> 28:18.583
When are you going
to start being reasonable?

28:18.667 --> 28:20.417
When you stop
being unreasonable.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.750
I honestly don't understand why

28:21.833 --> 28:23.333
you're being so difficult,
Ms. Connally.

28:23.417 --> 28:24.417
Every other guild
on this station

28:24.500 --> 28:25.708
has signed their agreement.

28:25.792 --> 28:27.333
They understand
that our government

28:27.417 --> 28:28.917
is not a bottomless pool
of money!

28:29.000 --> 28:31.583
I don't care if they've agreed
to wear bunny suits

28:31.667 --> 28:33.167
and sing
the "Hallelujah" chorus.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.708
We're not putting up
with this kind of treatment

28:34.792 --> 28:36.375
from Earth Central any longer.

28:36.458 --> 28:38.250
If you refuse to negotiate
in good faith..

28:38.333 --> 28:39.625
- You leave us no choice.
- Commander.

28:39.708 --> 28:41.125
This is obviously
a waste of time.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.917
Mr. Zento, Ms. Connally

28:43.000 --> 28:45.250
surely there's
some kind of an accommodation

28:45.333 --> 28:47.833
we can make
to end this peacefully.

28:47.917 --> 28:48.958
Now, I've been going over
the budget--

28:49.042 --> 28:50.458
Commander, the labor committee

28:50.542 --> 28:53.500
does not accommodate
illegal strikers.

28:53.583 --> 28:55.125
If you're having problems
with your budget

28:55.208 --> 28:57.042
I suggest you take it up
with the senate.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.708
As for you, Ms. Connally,
I strongly recommend

28:59.792 --> 29:02.375
you send your people
back to work now.

29:02.458 --> 29:04.083
Stuff it.

29:06.292 --> 29:09.833
Commander, I refuse to pander
to these people anymore.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.333
I'm invoking the Rush Act
as of now.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.542
You can't do that
without senate confirmation.

29:13.625 --> 29:15.167
I'll have it within the hour.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.083
And I'll expect
Mr. Garibaldi's people

29:17.167 --> 29:19.167
to be ready
to arrest Ms. Connally

29:19.250 --> 29:20.875
and any other worker
who persists

29:20.958 --> 29:23.083
in this illegal activity.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.792
I have to warn my people.

29:29.875 --> 29:32.917
[intense music]

29:34.083 --> 29:36.417
Damn it, Connally.
Can't you stop this now?

29:36.500 --> 29:38.458
It's too late for that,
commander.

29:38.542 --> 29:40.167
My workers are tired
and fed up.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.833
They've been pushed as far
as they're willing to go.

29:41.917 --> 29:44.500
This is not just a matter of
disrupting shipping schedules.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.125
You know what could happen
if I have to order Garibaldi in.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.917
Same thing
that happened on Europa

29:49.000 --> 29:50.875
and the New California
and at Matewan.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.917
The same thing that happens
every time labor stood up

29:53.000 --> 29:54.708
for themselves and said,
"No more."

29:54.792 --> 29:56.542
You try to break us,
we'll fight back.

29:56.625 --> 29:59.375
Someone will get hurt,
maybe killed.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.458
For what it's worth

30:05.542 --> 30:07.875
I'm sorry
this has to happen here.

30:07.958 --> 30:11.042
[music continues]

30:16.042 --> 30:17.375
All docking bays are full,
Transport Murano.

30:17.458 --> 30:19.208
We cannot accommodate you
at this time.

30:19.292 --> 30:21.000
(male #3)
'We've already
been holding for three hours.'

30:21.083 --> 30:22.208
(Mary Ann)
'We're making the strike
our lead'

30:22.292 --> 30:23.667
news item on tonight's program.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.250
Is it true
that Mr. Zento has declared

30:25.333 --> 30:26.875
the dockers' slowdown
an illegal strike

30:26.958 --> 30:29.667
and is seeking the senate
approval for the Rush Act?

30:29.750 --> 30:30.875
- No comments.
- Commander.

30:30.958 --> 30:32.083
We've got
two transports holding

30:32.167 --> 30:33.542
and a Minbari convoy in the..

30:33.625 --> 30:34.625
They'll have to wait.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.250
[indistinct yelling]

30:36.333 --> 30:39.000
And we will see what..
Well, we will see..

30:39.083 --> 30:42.292
Commander,
this creature is a thief.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.083
(Mollari)
'I demand
you arrest him at once.'

30:44.167 --> 30:46.583
Call me that again, Mollari,
and I'll tear your pale throat--

30:46.667 --> 30:48.542
This barbarian has stolen
the statue

30:48.625 --> 30:51.375
of our god Ruterian from
the Centauri Cultural Center--

30:51.458 --> 30:53.750
(G'Kar)
'I have been in the presence
of many witnesses'

30:53.833 --> 30:55.792
for several hours.
I have not stolen anything!

30:55.875 --> 30:58.250
Alright, then it was
your attack dog, Na'Toth

30:58.333 --> 30:59.417
but on your orders!

30:59.500 --> 31:01.250
I'm fed up
with your fabrications, Mollari!

31:01.333 --> 31:03.000
Commander, do you have
a comment on this?

31:03.083 --> 31:04.417
I demand you arrest him!

31:04.500 --> 31:06.000
I demand you arrest him!

31:06.083 --> 31:07.958
That's enough!

31:08.042 --> 31:12.250
Get the hell out of here,
all of you, now.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.292
Lieutenant Commander Ivanova,
in ten seconds

31:14.375 --> 31:17.042
you will escort any unauthorized
persons still present

31:17.125 --> 31:18.875
'to the brig
and leave them there.'

31:18.958 --> 31:20.792
Yes, sir.

31:20.875 --> 31:24.625
Ten, nine, eight, seven..

31:24.708 --> 31:26.125
- I'm filing official protest.
- Six..

31:26.208 --> 31:28.000
I-I'm filing
two official protests.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.750
You're impeding the public's
right to know, commander.

31:30.833 --> 31:32.375
Three!

31:33.958 --> 31:35.792
Two, one.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.583
So what did I miss?

31:38.667 --> 31:41.458
Commander,
call from Senator Hidoshi.

31:41.542 --> 31:44.542
- I'll take it here, um..
- '120, clear to go.'

31:44.625 --> 31:47.625
- 'Beta 7, jump..'
- Senator.

31:47.708 --> 31:50.458
Orin Zento has created an uproar
in the senate.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.625
- He has a knack for that.
- 'Commander.'

31:52.708 --> 31:54.208
I believe
you should be allowed

31:54.292 --> 31:56.833
to handle this situation
as you think best.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.250
Unfortunately,
Mr. Zento has convinced

31:59.333 --> 32:01.667
the majority of the senate
otherwise.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.708
'They have invoked the Rush Act'

32:03.792 --> 32:06.625
officially declaring
the situation on Babylon 5

32:06.708 --> 32:08.125
an illegal strike.

32:08.208 --> 32:11.167
You are ordered to move in
with your security troops

32:11.250 --> 32:12.458
and end it now.

32:12.542 --> 32:14.333
'No negotiations. No delay.'

32:14.417 --> 32:16.250
What you're asking
can only end in violence.

32:16.333 --> 32:18.083
I know that and I fear

32:18.167 --> 32:21.625
that's exactly what
some people are hoping for.

32:21.708 --> 32:23.292
Sorry, commander.

32:25.917 --> 32:29.167
Chief, get your people ready.
Full tactical alert.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.167
Lieutenant commander.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.000
I need to see the full text
of the senate order.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.375
Yes, sir.

32:36.375 --> 32:38.000
[intense music]

32:39.542 --> 32:41.042
(woman on radio)
'It is now official.'

32:41.125 --> 32:42.500
'The senate has invoked
the Rush Act'

32:42.583 --> 32:45.375
'in the dispute
with the Babylon 5 dockers.'

32:45.458 --> 32:47.208
'Replacement workers
are already reporting'

32:47.292 --> 32:48.542
'to launch centers on Earth..'

32:48.625 --> 32:50.375
Be careful
and watch each other's backs.

32:50.458 --> 32:51.917
(woman on radio)
'...are expected to begin
mass arrests..'

32:52.000 --> 32:54.042
Shut that thing off.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.333
It's going down,
and, everybody, remember

32:56.417 --> 32:58.500
we just got to keep cool.

32:58.583 --> 33:01.125
- 'They're coming!'
- Let 'em come!

33:01.208 --> 33:03.208
- 'We're ready!'
- 'Yeah!'

33:03.292 --> 33:06.333
[clamoring]

33:13.542 --> 33:15.833
Come to do your
master's bidding, Garibaldi?

33:15.917 --> 33:17.792
Come on, Neeoma,
you know why I'm here.

33:17.875 --> 33:20.333
Yeah, maybe you're looking
for an honest job.

33:20.417 --> 33:21.833
[workers laughing]

33:21.917 --> 33:23.417
I'm gonna ignore that.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.292
I have to place you
and your people under arrest.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.667
Don't make me do it
the hard way.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.417
There is no other way.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.792
So get to it
or get out of here.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.458
[indistinct chatter]

33:35.333 --> 33:38.375
[crowd clamoring]

33:51.792 --> 33:53.167
What's the situation, chief?

33:53.250 --> 33:54.792
We've cordoned off
the docking bay, give the word

33:54.875 --> 33:56.750
we'll pump in morph gas and
arrest 'em while they're asleep.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.583
- I wanted to avoid this.
- So did I, commander.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.458
Hey, if memory serves me
correctly, it was your guy

34:00.542 --> 34:01.875
Delvientos
who threw the first punch.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.042
...old wars,
but he is not a violent man.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.333
Alberto was the last
of his family

34:05.417 --> 34:06.625
and every one of 'em
was a docker.

34:06.708 --> 34:07.958
You have got to let me
talk to him.

34:08.042 --> 34:09.583
You've gotta let me talk
to all of them.

34:09.667 --> 34:10.833
Commander, why haven't your men

34:10.917 --> 34:12.125
finished clearing
those docks yet?

34:12.208 --> 34:13.750
I was just
going to do that. Mr. Garibaldi.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.208
'Instruct your men
to pull back to Blue Sector.'

34:16.292 --> 34:19.125
Mr. Zento, if you and Ms.
Connally will please join me..

34:19.208 --> 34:21.667
- What do you need me there for?
- You'll see.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.750
Pull back to Blue Sector!

34:24.833 --> 34:27.875
[clamoring]

34:29.208 --> 34:32.125
Yeah! Chalk one up
for the dock workers.

34:33.458 --> 34:35.042
Yeah.

34:35.125 --> 34:36.625
We did it, alright.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.417
[indistinct chatter]

34:39.500 --> 34:41.208
Here they come again.

34:42.542 --> 34:45.542
I hope you know
what you're doing, Jeff.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.500
[workers booing]

34:54.667 --> 34:57.708
[intense music]

35:05.083 --> 35:07.792
Quiet down. Hear him out.

35:11.250 --> 35:12.792
Under the Rush Act

35:12.875 --> 35:16.375
the senate has empowered me
to end this strike.

35:16.458 --> 35:19.250
I'm authorized to use
any means necessary.

35:19.333 --> 35:23.167
- 'Correct, Mr. Zento?'
- Yes, any means necessary.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.542
[indistinct chatter]

35:24.625 --> 35:26.917
Am I assured
of your full support on this?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.542
- Absolutely.
- Then under that authority..

35:29.625 --> 35:33.708
I choose the following means
to end this strike.

35:33.792 --> 35:35.333
One.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.708
I am reallocating
1.3 million credits

35:37.792 --> 35:40.458
'from Babylon 5's
military budget'

35:40.542 --> 35:43.750
'to begin necessary upgrades
of all dockside equipment'

35:43.833 --> 35:45.875
and to start hiring
additional workers.

35:45.958 --> 35:48.542
[workers cheering]

35:50.125 --> 35:51.958
Two.

35:52.042 --> 35:53.875
I am declaring
a complete amnesty

35:53.958 --> 35:56.250
for any striking worker
or guild representative

35:56.333 --> 35:58.917
who has committed no other
crimes during this period.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.375
[workers cheering]

36:00.458 --> 36:03.125
- That's you, kid.
- You can't do this.

36:03.208 --> 36:05.500
You're right, I couldn't
until you convinced the senate

36:05.583 --> 36:07.750
to invoke the Rush Act.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.417
You should
never hand someone a gun

36:09.500 --> 36:11.917
unless you're sure where
they'll point at, your mistake.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.167
[laughing]

36:14.875 --> 36:16.750
One minute.

36:16.833 --> 36:18.583
As for
the unfortunate incident earlier

36:18.667 --> 36:21.583
with Mr. Garibaldi's approval

36:21.667 --> 36:23.917
no charges will be pressed.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.708
I figure my people
are willing to call it

36:25.792 --> 36:27.083
a fair fight if yours are.

36:27.167 --> 36:30.250
- 'Alright!'
- 'Yeah! Yeah!'

36:30.333 --> 36:32.542
[workers cheering]

36:33.792 --> 36:35.333
That's my offer, Ms. Connally.

36:35.417 --> 36:36.750
That is,
dependent upon your people

36:36.833 --> 36:38.750
returning to work immediately

36:38.833 --> 36:40.958
Babylon 5 has cargo to move.

36:41.042 --> 36:42.292
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Ha-ha-ha..'

36:42.375 --> 36:43.833
You heard the man.

36:43.917 --> 36:45.917
Okay, you dock rats

36:46.000 --> 36:47.750
let's get back to work.

36:47.833 --> 36:49.958
[workers cheering]

36:51.792 --> 36:54.750
You know damn well you twisted
the intent of that order

36:54.833 --> 36:56.583
and you won't get away with it.

36:56.667 --> 36:59.917
I think Ms. Connally
said it best the other day.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.500
Stuff it.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.917
I underestimated you, commander.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.125
- I'm sorry, and thank you.
- Save it.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.792
We're both gonna catch
seven different kinds of hell

37:10.875 --> 37:12.125
over this down the road.

37:12.208 --> 37:14.625
My dad used to say
there are no happily-ever-afters

37:14.708 --> 37:16.625
just new battles.

37:16.708 --> 37:19.292
- Garibaldi.
- Ms. Connally.

37:19.375 --> 37:21.583
- I'll see you around.
- Pleasure.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.292
Uh, no offense, commander

37:27.375 --> 37:30.458
but, uh, you look like
week-old bread.

37:30.542 --> 37:32.125
Why don't you get some sleep?

37:32.208 --> 37:34.292
That's exactly
what I had in mind

37:34.375 --> 37:36.625
now that
we've calmed things down.

37:36.708 --> 37:37.917
[beeps]

37:38.000 --> 37:39.250
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

37:39.333 --> 37:41.625
(female #1)
'You better get up here.'

37:41.708 --> 37:42.833
What is it this time?

37:42.917 --> 37:44.292
'G'Kar and Londo
are approximately'

37:44.375 --> 37:46.958
'half an inch
from killing each other.'

37:55.167 --> 37:57.167
(Sinclair)
'Gentlemen, I've been up
for almost two days straight'

37:57.250 --> 37:59.833
with no sleep.
This makes me a very cranky man.

37:59.917 --> 38:03.583
Yes, we've noticed.
Have you considered meditation?

38:03.667 --> 38:05.667
Ambassador G'Kar,
you will return

38:05.750 --> 38:07.333
Ambassador Mollari's statue.

38:07.417 --> 38:09.000
But, commander,
I really must protest.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.000
- To even accuse--
- G'Kar will return the statue.

38:11.083 --> 38:14.667
- Yeah, but..
- And that is all I ask.

38:14.750 --> 38:18.083
That and his head on a platter.

38:18.167 --> 38:21.667
Ambassador Mollari,
I ran a check on the G'Quan Eth

38:21.750 --> 38:23.458
and discovered
it had a chemical composition

38:23.542 --> 38:25.875
which makes it a controlled
botanical substance.

38:25.958 --> 38:27.458
Illegal to possess, except

38:27.542 --> 38:30.250
for legitimate medical
or religious purposes.

38:30.333 --> 38:33.875
[laughs]
Ridiculous.

38:33.958 --> 38:37.167
It is no more harmful
than a bottle of your whisky.

38:37.250 --> 38:38.583
File a protest if you wish

38:38.667 --> 38:40.542
but you'll have to turn
the plant over to me.

38:40.625 --> 38:43.125
You'll be fully compensated.

38:43.208 --> 38:45.583
Alright, commander.

38:47.417 --> 38:50.125
You may have the G'Quan Eth.

38:51.542 --> 38:53.667
- Thank you, ambassador.
- Oh..

38:55.417 --> 38:59.000
I have already gotten
my enjoyment from it anyway.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.375
Ambassador G'Kar

39:05.458 --> 39:08.875
when you have returned
Londo's statue

39:08.958 --> 39:11.875
I'll turn the G'Quan Eth
over to you

39:11.958 --> 39:14.333
and you'll compensate Londo
for it, full price.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.333
Why should I turn
the statue over

39:16.417 --> 39:17.833
assuming that I knew
where it was

39:17.917 --> 39:20.167
when it's already too late
for the ceremony?

39:20.250 --> 39:23.792
Mollari knows that.
That's why he gave in so easily.

39:23.875 --> 39:26.625
This ritual
is supposed to be performed

39:26.708 --> 39:29.250
in the sunlight that has
touched the G'Quan Mountain

39:29.333 --> 39:32.042
on a particular day
at a particular time.

39:32.125 --> 39:33.583
- 'Right?'
- Yes.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.208
'But as your people
went into space'

39:35.292 --> 39:37.417
it wasn't always possible to be
at the foot of that mountain.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.542
- And pray in that sunlight.
- Yes, yes.

39:39.625 --> 39:41.833
If we can't be there,
we must still make our prayers

39:41.917 --> 39:44.417
at the same moment
as those on our planet.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.208
What you forgot
to take into account

39:46.292 --> 39:49.500
is that sunlight
also travels through space.

39:49.583 --> 39:50.792
'Think about it.'

39:50.875 --> 39:53.792
'This station
is 12.2 light years from Narn.'

39:53.875 --> 39:55.958
'That's just a little over
ten of your light years.'

39:56.042 --> 39:58.292
The sunlight that touched
G'Quan Mountain

39:58.375 --> 39:59.792
ten of your years ago

39:59.875 --> 40:02.875
will reach this station
in twelve hours.

40:02.958 --> 40:05.417
'It's been on a long journey'

40:05.500 --> 40:07.875
but it's still the same sunlight

40:07.958 --> 40:10.375
good enough for you
to conduct your ceremony.

40:10.458 --> 40:11.458
Wouldn't you agree?

40:11.542 --> 40:15.333
Yes, it might be.

40:15.417 --> 40:18.833
Commander, you are
a far more spiritual man

40:18.917 --> 40:20.542
than I gave you credit for.

40:20.625 --> 40:22.500
There are a couple
of Jesuit teachers I know

40:22.583 --> 40:24.667
who might disagree with you.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.375
I want that statue returned.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.458
I'm sure a careful search
will turn it up.

40:29.542 --> 40:31.708
I'll see to it immediately.

40:34.250 --> 40:38.167
Commander...thank you.

40:41.958 --> 40:43.375
[exhales sharply]

40:46.750 --> 40:50.208
Computer, hold all
transmissions. I'm going to bed.

40:50.292 --> 40:54.000
(computer)
'You have
one transmission holding.'

40:54.083 --> 40:55.708
Put it through.

40:55.792 --> 40:59.208
Senator Hidoshi,
I've been expecting your call.

40:59.292 --> 41:03.042
Remind me never to play poker
with you.

41:03.125 --> 41:06.500
Sinclair,
you are a hell of a gambler.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.208
This time you won.

41:08.292 --> 41:11.125
The senators decided to let
your decision on the strike

41:11.208 --> 41:12.875
stand without comment.

41:12.958 --> 41:14.542
I'm glad they see it my way.

41:14.625 --> 41:18.833
They do not, but public opinion
is on your side.

41:19.833 --> 41:21.000
I see.

41:21.083 --> 41:25.042
'Commander, I admire
what you've done there.'

41:25.125 --> 41:27.875
My great-grandfather worked
the new Kobe space docks

41:27.958 --> 41:29.625
until the day he died.

41:29.708 --> 41:32.375
I will admit,
the discomfort you've given

41:32.458 --> 41:34.500
some of my colleague pleases me.

41:34.583 --> 41:38.167
[laughs]
This is why
I'm telling you this.

41:38.250 --> 41:42.000
Orin Zento has powerful friends.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.667
'By embarrassing him,
you embarrass them.'

41:45.750 --> 41:49.750
Today you have made new enemies.

41:49.833 --> 41:51.000
If I were you, commander

41:51.083 --> 41:53.583
I would watch things
very carefully.

41:53.667 --> 41:56.750
You are not
the most popular person

41:56.833 --> 41:59.167
in government circles right now.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.167
[sighs]

42:04.250 --> 42:06.292
So what else is new?

42:08.125 --> 42:10.083
[intense music]

42:11.167 --> 42:13.500
(G'Kar)
'The gift of time.'

42:16.458 --> 42:18.583
The gift of life.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.000
The gift of wisdom.

42:29.667 --> 42:31.708
The gift of light.

42:35.208 --> 42:37.958
For these things
we are thankful.

42:38.042 --> 42:40.875
For these things we pray.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.583
(all)
For these things
we are thankful.

42:43.667 --> 42:46.083
For these things we pray.

42:46.167 --> 42:49.250
[singing in foreign language]

43:08.000 --> 43:11.042
[theme music]

43:38.750 --> 43:41.833
[music continues]
