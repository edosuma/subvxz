WEBVTT

00:58.892 --> 01:01.687
Hello? Is anybody there?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.732
Hey, honey, what's up?

01:05.816 --> 01:08.944
Slow down. Who are you talking about?

01:09.027 --> 01:12.447
No, I don't know! Sweetheart,
I don't have a clue what you're...

01:12.739 --> 01:14.241
An apartment?

01:16.827 --> 01:19.121
No, no! Of course I'm not
looking at an apartment!

01:19.204 --> 01:21.832
Why would I be
looking at an apartment?

01:23.458 --> 01:25.210
Wait a sec, wait. I know what this is.

01:25.294 --> 01:30.048
Oldest trick in the book. Yeah.
Did a realtor call you? Yeah.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.552
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says,
"Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.721
"I'm looking at a..."

01:35.804 --> 01:38.932
My card? My business card?
I don't know.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.711
That I don't know. I don't know
why he has my business card.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.063
Maybe he...

01:46.398 --> 01:48.442
Maybe he or she, then.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.904
Yeah.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.239
Okay, surprise ruined.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.741
No, no, it's all right.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.784
It was gonna be for our anniversary,
but I...

01:57.868 --> 01:59.953
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom
in the West Village,

02:00.037 --> 02:01.288
but you're gonna love it.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.874
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.293
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up
for this thing at the Waldorf.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.505
I got to go. I'll see you at home tonight,
okay, honey?

02:09.588 --> 02:12.049
I love you, too.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.510
It's okay. Big kiss.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.595
All right, then. Bye-bye.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.563
Hey, let me ask you a question.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.887
You a real estate broker
or a professional fucking idiot?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.946
Babe, I really think
we ought to let the super do that.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.781
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.283
No, I did not say
my wife needs to see the apartment.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.828
I said Amber needs
to see the apartment. Amber.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.957
Amber sound like the wife
of a man my age to you?

02:45.749 --> 02:47.584
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.710
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?

02:48.794 --> 02:50.963
Okay, all right. I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.048
Just keep it out of my way.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.384
Well, it's not exactly a love nest

02:55.467 --> 02:58.011
if my wife's there picking out
the goddamned curtains, is it?

02:58.095 --> 03:00.055
Careful, just get the window,
get the window.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.515
- Okay?
- Ready?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.100
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.311
No, I'm telling you right now,
stop talking.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.896
Because I'm thinking.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.984
No, I'm thinking! I don't...
You know what? Just kill it.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.319
No, kill it. Kill the whole thing.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.698
- There, good.
- See? DIY. "Do It Yourself."

03:17.781 --> 03:18.991
Oh, no!

03:22.995 --> 03:24.913
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine

03:24.997 --> 03:26.748
saying the seller's
had a change of heart,

03:26.832 --> 03:29.209
and that the whole thing's...

03:29.293 --> 03:31.336
- Oh, my God!
Dead.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.299
You are not gonna believe
what almost just happened!

03:42.723 --> 03:45.184
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!

03:46.059 --> 03:48.854
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.493
What?

04:08.290 --> 04:10.626
You cannot be serious!

04:14.963 --> 04:16.380
Not now.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.626
Okay, go ahead and spit.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.300
So, anyway, the very first scene
just takes your breath away.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.969
You have to remind yourself that
you're in the theater watching a play.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.347
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.142
He wanted his father to see it with us.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.021
That's better.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.691
Anyway, I think he really,
really enjoyed the costumes...

05:59.318 --> 06:01.570
Dr. Pincus? Hi.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.947
I'm gonna need
the panoramic X-ray machine

06:04.031 --> 06:05.199
for most of the morning tomorrow,

06:05.282 --> 06:07.659
so if that fits in
with your appointments...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.661
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.

06:09.745 --> 06:10.954
Really?

06:13.624 --> 06:16.627
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.547
And?

06:21.465 --> 06:25.844
No, I just thought that maybe
you were taking the day off to go and...

06:29.056 --> 06:31.808
Right. Sorry to bother you.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.980
You know, we brought some cake.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.776
Mrs. Prashar and I
just had our baby, so...

06:43.737 --> 06:45.364
Yeah, it's a girl,

06:45.447 --> 06:52.162
and we're having a little cake
and I brought some pictures, so, if you...

06:52.246 --> 06:54.039
That'd be delightful.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.751
Start without me.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.881
Great, great. Okay, so...

07:08.595 --> 07:10.806
What a cute baby. She is so cute.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.058
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.893
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.186
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

07:16.270 --> 07:20.023
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.817
- It's not?
- Not really.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.944
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.530
I'll just get a cat, you know?

07:26.613 --> 07:30.701
Like, 10 hours is a long time
to get something, you know?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.160
- Look at that.
- So cute.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.298
Stop global warming?

07:54.600 --> 07:57.561
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.438
Good evening, Doctor.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.733
You know what? Let me just open it.

08:04.610 --> 08:08.155
Hey! Can you hold the elevator?
Please?

08:08.238 --> 08:11.033
- Yeah. Holding.
- Thank you.

08:13.744 --> 08:17.414
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold. Hey! Hey!

09:29.486 --> 09:31.363
Good. Still some more.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.211
Come on, come on, come on,

09:46.295 --> 09:48.380
make it, make it, make it,
make it, make it, make it.

09:48.463 --> 09:51.842
<i>Paging Dr. Michael,
Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.</i>

09:51.925 --> 09:53.645
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.

09:53.677 --> 09:54.720
I appreciate it.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.848
<b>- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.</b>

09:57.931 --> 10:00.517
- Date of birth?
- Why?

10:00.601 --> 10:02.019
What day were you born?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.897
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.482
Let's leave it blank. Weight?

10:07.566 --> 10:09.443
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.195
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.614
Number of alcoholic beverages
consumed per week?

10:13.697 --> 10:16.074
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.576
Well, I'm sure
"they" want to know a lot of things,

10:17.659 --> 10:19.369
but I don't want my intimate details

10:19.453 --> 10:21.622
auctioned off to the highest bidder,
willy-nilly.

10:21.705 --> 10:22.915
I'll put zero.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.958
- Marital status?
- Pass.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.960
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.

10:27.044 --> 10:30.297
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.342
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.718
I'm not answering
any more of these, really.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.428
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.514
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.

10:38.597 --> 10:43.352
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.312
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.523
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...

10:47.606 --> 10:50.692
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.152
Did it work?

10:53.111 --> 10:56.240
It was as advertised.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.450
Did you evacuate your bowels?

10:58.534 --> 11:01.578
I drank copious amounts
of drain-cleaning fluid.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.497
<i>What followed was fait accompli.</i>

11:03.580 --> 11:05.100
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...

11:05.165 --> 11:10.337
I shat. Okay? Good. Again and again.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.924
It was like a terrorist attack down there
in the darkness and the chaos,

11:14.007 --> 11:15.843
the running and the screaming, okay?

11:15.926 --> 11:18.428
- Fine with me.
- Good.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.597
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.141
Wait till they get you in the back.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.854
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.272
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.148
We'll have you up
and on your feet in no time.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.275
- Okay.
- Quick question.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.443
I notice you requested
a general anesthetic.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.988
It's not really typical
for this type of procedure.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.614
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.492
I have no intention of being around
when they go where they're going.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.786
When does the surgeon arrive?

11:42.870 --> 11:44.079
I'm the surgeon.

11:44.163 --> 11:45.956
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.583
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.127
I got a spray tan
on my way to work today.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.005
- Looks natural.
- Yes. It's better for you.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.248
<b>It's moisturizing
and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...</b>

11:55.257 --> 11:56.341
Yeah.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.635
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.513
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!

12:01.597 --> 12:03.265
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.

12:03.348 --> 12:06.685
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.521
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am. I think I'd like to go darker.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.190
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.775
You could get your teeth whitened
like I did.

12:13.859 --> 12:14.985
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.197
Yeah, I don't like having trays
in my mouth and my teeth are small.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.573
Sorry, you babbling idiots.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.951
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

12:23.035 --> 12:25.316
Looks like the sodium thiopental's
really kicking in, huh?

12:25.329 --> 12:28.290
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.459
- Going in now.
- How old are you?

12:30.542 --> 12:33.253
So are you here on a school field trip?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.964
Not a real people person are you,
Dr. Pincus?

12:36.048 --> 12:39.718
Not really. Given a choice between
a few people and loads of people,

12:39.760 --> 12:42.054
I choose my cat. She hunts dwarves.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.056
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.557
You can see their little legs going.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.435
Sounds like Norah Jones
when she plays the piano.

12:56.151 --> 12:59.029
Wow, you must be excited
to get home and see your cat.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.155
What cat?

13:00.239 --> 13:02.074
I thought yesterday
you said you had a cat.

13:02.157 --> 13:06.745
I despise cats. What sort of men
waste their affection on a cat? Pathetic.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.248
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.

13:09.373 --> 13:12.084
My father, right before he died,
he took me to the shelter and he said,

13:12.167 --> 13:13.460
"Debra, take a look
at all these lonely cats..."

13:13.544 --> 13:15.420
What a wonderful man
he must have been.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.547
Now, listen.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.190
All those people in my room last night,

13:18.215 --> 13:19.925
I thought I was dreaming at first,
but I wasn't.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.468
Who were they?

13:22.177 --> 13:24.429
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.

13:24.513 --> 13:28.183
- Here you go. Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.395
Come back soon!

13:31.436 --> 13:34.356
What a terrible thing to say
in a hospital.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.079
Nice.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.749
Fine example for healthcare workers.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.003
Still, I suppose
smoking serves a purpose.

13:56.086 --> 13:59.590
- Thins the herd. Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?

13:59.631 --> 14:01.550
Yeah, but I was having a go at them,
not you.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.885
Oh, good.

14:02.968 --> 14:06.680
I picked one that should be
in a straightjacket. My mistake.

14:13.437 --> 14:17.065
Show it some attention,
it follows you home. Unbelievable.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.402
Sorry!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.116
Did he see you, too?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.414
- He can see us!
- Who?

14:32.498 --> 14:33.790
That guy?

14:40.047 --> 14:42.508
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?

14:50.974 --> 14:52.184
Hey!

14:53.227 --> 14:54.686
Hey, mister!

14:55.521 --> 14:57.356
Please, just hold up!

14:58.065 --> 15:00.067
- Idiot. Get out of the road.
- Wait! Hey!

15:00.150 --> 15:03.153
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!

15:07.407 --> 15:09.034
Of your time!

15:10.077 --> 15:11.870
You can see me, huh?

15:13.831 --> 15:15.624
And you're not like us.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.794
I know you're not, because back there,
that cab almost hit you!

15:18.877 --> 15:21.713
And he honked at you,
and he yelled at you!

15:22.256 --> 15:24.925
I don't feel well. Why on earth...

15:26.260 --> 15:27.344
Hey!

15:35.894 --> 15:37.688
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.565
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.859
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.152
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!

15:44.236 --> 15:45.696
Hey, don't be scared! I'm a cop!

15:45.779 --> 15:47.948
- He can see us?
- Who? That guy?

16:19.688 --> 16:21.315
From the moment I left the hospital.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.151
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.944
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.

16:26.028 --> 16:31.450
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.287
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know? Really.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.041
Not having hallucinations,
I'd have thought.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.419
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

16:42.503 --> 16:44.129
- Did any...
- Did any what...

16:44.171 --> 16:46.840
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?

16:46.924 --> 16:49.301
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...

16:49.384 --> 16:52.513
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...

16:52.596 --> 16:55.766
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.434
- Just answer the...
- Just.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.269
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?

16:59.353 --> 17:02.898
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper... Yes or no?

17:02.981 --> 17:04.861
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

17:04.942 --> 17:05.943
- Yeah.
- What?

17:06.026 --> 17:08.069
- No.
- You said "yes" first.

17:08.153 --> 17:13.492
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.288
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

17:18.372 --> 17:21.208
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...

17:21.290 --> 17:23.292
Can you hold on a second?

17:25.671 --> 17:27.130
Yeah, it's me.

17:27.798 --> 17:31.593
Can you stop what you're doing
and come down here right away?

17:33.387 --> 17:36.014
It's that thing that we talked about.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.561
Yeah, well, you told me to call you
if it came back, and it came back, so...

17:40.644 --> 17:42.020
Okay.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.690
What was that? What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.

17:44.773 --> 17:48.902
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.780
You... Miss!

17:51.864 --> 17:52.865
- Yes?
- Me!

17:52.948 --> 17:55.576
- What the... What?
- Can you...

17:55.701 --> 17:57.286
- Can I... Yes.
- Follow you?

17:57.369 --> 17:59.121
- To the...
- To my office.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.540
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.878
What?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.717
Did anything unusual... What?

18:13.051 --> 18:16.013
Jesus Christ! Sorry, I wasn't...

18:16.221 --> 18:20.392
We have a meeting in a couple minutes,
so we just have to be quick.

18:22.603 --> 18:26.982
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure? What's he...

18:27.065 --> 18:29.401
Can you please define "unusual"?

18:31.236 --> 18:34.114
Out of the ordinary,
bizarre, unanticipated.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.536
No, this went well.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.331
- It was good. Okay, normal.
- Right.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.583
Yes, good. Well, the cessation maybe,

18:44.666 --> 18:47.503
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?

18:47.586 --> 18:50.047
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that

18:50.130 --> 18:52.883
every medical procedure
doesn't follow the same path.

18:52.925 --> 18:53.967
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.

18:54.051 --> 18:56.411
There are subtle variations
in even the simplest surgical...

18:56.470 --> 18:59.223
What would a subtle variation be
in my case, for example?

18:59.264 --> 19:02.267
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.521
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.898
Medically, it's beginning...

19:11.401 --> 19:13.153
Okay. Yeah.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.239
- You died.
- I died?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.449
- Little bit.
- For how long?

19:17.533 --> 19:19.451
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.786
I died for seven minutes.

19:20.828 --> 19:21.870
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...

19:21.954 --> 19:24.039
That's really the only thing
that I can think of...

19:24.122 --> 19:26.333
How did I die?

19:26.416 --> 19:30.087
For the record, we did not recommend
that you use the general anesthesia.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.966
When you use anesthesia,
there is a chance, although it is small,

19:34.049 --> 19:37.010
of a biochemical anomaly.

19:37.094 --> 19:39.888
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.

19:39.972 --> 19:41.390
He does not work here anymore.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.433
You'll be happy to know
that at Saint Victor's,

19:43.517 --> 19:46.395
we have a very strict
three-strikes policy.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.399
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?

19:50.482 --> 19:53.318
Okay, let's all calm down.

19:53.402 --> 19:57.030
Let's just not overdramatize
the situation.

19:57.114 --> 19:58.991
Why is he calming down?

20:00.993 --> 20:02.578
Everybody dies.

20:05.622 --> 20:09.126
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life,
and just the once and forever.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.836
Everybody's different.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.671
And you weren't even gonna tell me.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.673
- No, we did tell you. We told you...
- No, you didn't.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.633
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.

20:16.717 --> 20:20.012
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes. Yeah, we...

20:20.053 --> 20:24.391
It says here that you gurgled to me

20:24.474 --> 20:28.353
before you rolled your eyes back
in your head, a little bit.

20:32.357 --> 20:36.528
Have you any idea
how much I'm gonna sue you for?

20:36.612 --> 20:38.947
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up. Go on.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.158
You signed a general release
and a quitclaim form,

20:41.200 --> 20:43.327
relieving your surgeon,
your anesthesiologist,

20:43.410 --> 20:46.130
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative
Institutional Health Partners

20:46.205 --> 20:47.498
from any liability related

20:47.539 --> 20:49.699
to your anesthetic-induced cessation
of heart function.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.293
I definitely did not.

20:51.376 --> 20:54.421
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?

20:54.505 --> 20:56.945
Right after you passed
the post-operative responsiveness test,

20:57.007 --> 20:58.884
legally mandated
by the state of New York.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.136
Obviously I didn't know
what I was doing!

21:01.220 --> 21:02.846
You knew enough to sign your name.

21:02.888 --> 21:05.807
I dotted the "i" with a little love heart!

21:05.891 --> 21:08.310
You were happy to be alive, right?

21:09.353 --> 21:12.940
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?

21:13.023 --> 21:14.233
People.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.460
Hey, got a sec?

21:37.172 --> 21:40.092
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?

21:40.175 --> 21:43.303
No. I'm not the guy.
It's another guy. Go away.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.389
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.225
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there. Unbelievable.

21:48.267 --> 21:51.186
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent. Thank you!

21:51.270 --> 21:52.855
Hey. Wait a minute. Wait, what?

21:52.938 --> 21:55.274
- Drive!
- No, no, no.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.150
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!

21:57.234 --> 21:59.528
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.488
That woman whose cab
you just snaked, that's my wife.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.365
- That's perfect.
- My widow.

22:03.448 --> 22:07.286
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.788
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.707
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!

22:11.790 --> 22:13.167
Okay, that narrows it down.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.173
I don't want a Sapphire martini
up with olives.

22:15.252 --> 22:17.462
Okay, that narrows it down.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.131
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool
out of yourself.

22:19.214 --> 22:21.258
You can't talk to me
when somebody's standing there.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.969
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.054
No.

22:27.556 --> 22:30.475
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.228
Pimm's Cup? Pimm's?

22:33.312 --> 22:34.813
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!

22:34.897 --> 22:36.565
Okay! Sorry.

22:36.648 --> 22:40.569
Can I have the first thing I said?

22:40.652 --> 22:42.988
Sapphire martini up with olives.

22:46.992 --> 22:49.620
- Shut up.
- Wow. You need to adjust, right?

22:49.661 --> 22:51.121
No, it's okay, it's okay.

22:51.163 --> 22:53.665
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust. I get it.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.167
I haven't done jack in 14 months.

22:55.209 --> 22:58.795
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!

23:01.298 --> 23:02.966
What do you mean?

23:03.634 --> 23:06.261
- I was dead. For seven minutes.
- Yeah?

23:07.095 --> 23:09.014
And then when they brought me back,
I can...

23:09.056 --> 23:11.934
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.

23:12.017 --> 23:13.769
I mean, they're everywhere,

23:13.852 --> 23:16.480
and they're a noisy,
pushy, demanding bunch,

23:16.522 --> 23:19.191
same as when they were alive,
and frustrated, too.

23:19.274 --> 23:20.692
The dead have
a lot of unfinished business,

23:20.734 --> 23:22.611
which is why we're still here.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.863
And normally, we can't talk to the living

23:24.947 --> 23:27.324
and, suddenly, you come along,
and you can imagine.

23:27.366 --> 23:29.284
A lot of excitement.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.537
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maПпtre d'?

23:31.620 --> 23:33.372
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.791
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.

23:35.874 --> 23:38.210
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.

23:38.252 --> 23:39.586
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.

23:39.670 --> 23:41.672
- All right.
- Just shut up.

23:42.381 --> 23:44.341
Aesthetically pleasing.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.135
Am I still dead? I'm still dead, aren't I?

23:47.219 --> 23:49.339
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.349
I'm lying on the operating table,
they're gonna bring me around, and...

23:52.391 --> 23:54.268
It's all gonna be a dream.

23:54.351 --> 23:58.230
Yeah. Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.

23:58.313 --> 24:01.400
Have a drink. Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.695
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.

24:04.736 --> 24:05.988
What, have you got a signal?

24:06.071 --> 24:08.073
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.

24:08.156 --> 24:11.201
Thank goodness
I downloaded Tetris before I went.

24:11.243 --> 24:13.328
Damn it! How'd you die?

24:14.329 --> 24:15.581
Something went wrong
with the anesthetic.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.708
I went in for a colonoscopy
and it went all...

24:17.791 --> 24:18.834
Yeah, I never got one of those.

24:18.917 --> 24:19.918
I don't think
you have to worry about it now.

24:20.002 --> 24:22.296
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.

24:22.379 --> 24:23.380
- What?
- Yeah.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.798
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:24.882 --> 24:27.718
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?

24:27.759 --> 24:31.763
Don't actually say "ass feelings."
I knew what you meant with that.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.683
- Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!

24:34.766 --> 24:36.560
May I ask you a question, young man?

24:36.602 --> 24:39.730
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.

24:39.813 --> 24:42.733
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!

24:42.774 --> 24:45.027
All right? I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.821
I certainly see no harm
in making a request of the young man.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.615
How about the fact
that I found him first?

24:49.698 --> 24:53.744
Look what you did. You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.

25:06.757 --> 25:09.384
Yeah, very good. I know you're there.

25:09.468 --> 25:12.137
Let's start over, huh? Come on.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.056
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.

25:14.139 --> 25:16.600
You do yoga? You do yoga?

25:16.683 --> 25:18.602
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.

25:18.644 --> 25:20.854
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.356
Did I say I was a perfect person?

25:22.439 --> 25:25.025
- Come on, let's hail a cab. She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?

25:25.108 --> 25:27.945
You're the bizarre aftereffects
of some poorly-administered anesthetic.

25:27.986 --> 25:30.346
I'm gonna go home to bed,
and when I wake up in the morning,

25:30.364 --> 25:32.282
with any luck, you'll be gone.

25:32.324 --> 25:34.004
That would be truly rotten luck
for my wife

25:34.076 --> 25:36.245
who just needs a little bit of your help.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.164
- Lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.

25:39.206 --> 25:41.926
Hey, I don't want to play hardball
with you, but I will if I have to.

25:41.959 --> 25:43.460
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.

25:43.502 --> 25:46.129
Pincus? Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.

25:46.213 --> 25:47.714
- It's my wife, okay? She lives right...
- Widow.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.718
She lives right here in this building,
all right?

25:49.758 --> 25:51.009
She's getting married
in a couple of months

25:51.051 --> 25:53.345
to a real scumbag lawyer,
a bad, bad guy.

25:53.387 --> 25:54.507
Somebody's got to stop this.

25:54.513 --> 25:56.849
What do you care?
You were having an affair.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.977
Never been married, right? Okay.
You need time.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.521
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.524
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.032
- What?
- Is this a bad time?

26:55.073 --> 26:56.867
My letter went under the carpet.

26:56.909 --> 26:59.411
He lost something important,
and I know where it is.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.039
She won't wear a helmet
because of me, but that's nuts!

27:06.335 --> 27:07.377
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor,

27:07.419 --> 27:10.756
did I accidentally give everybody
your home address?

27:16.762 --> 27:19.306
If you don't help her, she won't...

27:20.098 --> 27:23.769
I got to tell you, nobody was
more excited than Naked Guy. He's...

27:32.569 --> 27:34.112
Leave me alone.

27:35.113 --> 27:37.449
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!

27:37.491 --> 27:40.244
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry. Never mind.

27:42.871 --> 27:45.290
- Bless you.
- Oh, God. Thank you.

27:47.459 --> 27:51.839
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

27:52.589 --> 27:53.799
- Bless you.
- Stop it.

27:53.841 --> 27:56.844
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you. Just...

27:56.927 --> 28:00.305
I'm not very well. It's not you.
It's a bit you.

28:01.306 --> 28:05.018
Mainly... You can't... But you're adding.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.316
Don't you see, Pincus,
there's a reason I'm here and this is it.

28:11.400 --> 28:15.696
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen,
trying to get his hands on her money.

28:15.779 --> 28:17.281
I left her a good chunk of change,
you know.

28:17.364 --> 28:20.075
- My head. It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.

28:20.159 --> 28:21.618
You can be
the guardian angel's assistant.

28:21.702 --> 28:22.703
- Pass.
- What?

28:22.786 --> 28:23.912
You don't want to help me
earn my wings?

28:23.996 --> 28:25.205
I don't care.

28:25.289 --> 28:28.584
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?

28:28.667 --> 28:30.002
She chose you, didn't she?

28:30.085 --> 28:32.629
And now she's got a new slimeball,
and if that doesn't work out,

28:32.713 --> 28:34.631
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong
will come along,

28:34.673 --> 28:35.924
'cause that seems to be her thing.

28:36.008 --> 28:38.302
Now, leave me alone.

28:38.343 --> 28:40.512
I've got a crown at 8:00 a. m.

28:41.972 --> 28:45.684
I see! I understand, I get it.

28:45.726 --> 28:49.021
- What? What do you get?
- You. Just this whole self-loathing thing.

28:49.104 --> 28:51.064
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.

28:51.148 --> 28:52.816
Frankie spent some time on the couch.

28:52.858 --> 28:54.484
You know, dentists have
one of the highest suicide rates

28:54.526 --> 28:55.611
of any other profession.

28:55.694 --> 28:57.070
But this might really give you a chance

28:57.154 --> 28:59.156
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up. Shut up!

28:59.239 --> 29:02.326
Okay? Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit! I like what I do.

29:02.367 --> 29:04.077
Do you know why? It suits me.

29:04.161 --> 29:06.241
Because 90%% % of the people
I come into contact with

29:06.288 --> 29:08.207
have cotton wool
shoved in their mouths.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.334
I'm not interested
in their political opinions.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.252
<i>I don't care
what they thought of Spamalot.</i>

29:12.336 --> 29:16.048
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!

29:17.049 --> 29:18.842
You are a sad little man.

29:18.884 --> 29:21.303
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.721
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.

29:22.804 --> 29:26.099
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.

29:26.183 --> 29:29.645
Come on. You don't think
I'm gonna find you in a hotel?

29:33.357 --> 29:34.942
This is crazy, all right?

29:35.025 --> 29:38.028
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal. Okay?

29:38.070 --> 29:40.823
I'll talk to them for you,
get them to leave you alone.

29:40.906 --> 29:43.492
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.

29:43.575 --> 29:44.618
Did.

29:46.453 --> 29:47.746
Look, you do this one thing for me,

29:47.788 --> 29:50.707
you'll never see any of us
ever again, okay?

29:52.918 --> 29:54.419
Problem solved.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.298
Yeah, okay.

30:01.593 --> 30:04.721
<i>The mummy's been examined
by virologists,</i>

30:04.763 --> 30:07.057
<i>oncologists, forensic pathologists,</i>

30:07.099 --> 30:09.393
<i>searching for signs of foul play,</i>

30:09.434 --> 30:14.064
but Pepi the Third's cause of death
at the relatively young age of 23

30:14.106 --> 30:15.732
still remains a mystery.

30:15.816 --> 30:17.609
It can't be that hard
to break up a relationship.

30:17.651 --> 30:19.444
I used to screw
these things up all the time.

30:19.486 --> 30:22.573
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to
seduce him and videotape it, you know?

30:22.656 --> 30:23.824
That woman lives in my building?

30:23.907 --> 30:26.869
Or we send her an anonymous letter
from his other family.

30:26.952 --> 30:28.620
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?

30:28.662 --> 30:31.290
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.792
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.

30:33.834 --> 30:35.878
What are you, a brain in a jar?

30:35.961 --> 30:37.921
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.131
- Really?
- Yes.

30:39.214 --> 30:44.011
And the grand manner in which
Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved

30:44.094 --> 30:48.307
also suggests that he was embalmed
by royal mummifiers,

30:48.390 --> 30:51.810
as opposed to
curbside-marketplace perverts...

30:51.894 --> 30:53.312
Preservists.

30:54.146 --> 30:55.314
That's awkward.

30:55.397 --> 30:58.901
I suppose
the simplest way to break it up

30:58.984 --> 31:01.820
would be to plant a seed of doubt
in her mind.

31:01.904 --> 31:04.948
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.

31:05.032 --> 31:07.701
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.

31:07.784 --> 31:09.495
You mean hire
a good-looking male model...

31:09.578 --> 31:12.247
Don't hire anyone. Don't...
No, don't need...

31:12.331 --> 31:14.666
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?

31:14.750 --> 31:17.544
Not too handsome. Not chiseled,
just approachable. Sort of...

31:17.628 --> 31:19.963
'Cause I was thinking, like,
rugged and somebody tough.

31:20.005 --> 31:23.091
Round-faced, if anything and sensitive.

31:23.175 --> 31:24.801
Well, he's gonna have to have
a lot of cash, though.

31:24.885 --> 31:26.386
If he's sensible with his money,

31:26.470 --> 31:28.305
he's probably invested well,
and that would be attractive.

31:28.347 --> 31:30.015
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:30.098 --> 31:31.725
- She might like that.
- Yeah.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.560
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.729
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no. Average.

31:35.812 --> 31:38.524
- Really?
- Yeah. Bordering on the short.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.360
Oh, my word, you mean you.

31:46.657 --> 31:47.991
- I'm... Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Forget it.

31:48.033 --> 31:52.246
Don't walk away mad!
Come here! Pink-Ass!

31:52.371 --> 31:59.294
I would like to elaborate further on
Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site. Here...

31:59.545 --> 32:01.088
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

32:01.171 --> 32:05.050
That's okay. I mean, a lot of great ideas
sound completely ridiculous at first.

32:05.133 --> 32:06.343
Sorry I even brought it up.

32:06.385 --> 32:09.555
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.

32:09.638 --> 32:11.431
I mean, all you're gonna have to do
is be charming enough

32:11.515 --> 32:15.060
to give her a few second thoughts,
you know?

32:15.185 --> 32:16.728
Be a challenge.

32:18.355 --> 32:20.566
Almost impossible.

32:20.649 --> 32:23.110
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.

32:23.193 --> 32:27.781
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.

32:28.949 --> 32:34.079
- Really. I can do this. I can do it.
- Forget it.

32:34.163 --> 32:35.956
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?

32:36.039 --> 32:38.959
- Good God, no.
- No? You got a girlfriend?

32:39.042 --> 32:43.589
No, just between us, currently.

32:44.673 --> 32:49.595
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.

32:49.636 --> 32:52.598
We've also conducted
extensive CT scans

32:52.639 --> 32:55.976
to search for orthopedic trauma,
which may have led to infection,

32:56.059 --> 32:59.188
as you may remember was the case
with Tutankhamen

32:59.271 --> 33:02.107
as shown here on slide 43.

33:02.149 --> 33:03.400
Nope, nope, you know what?

33:03.442 --> 33:05.027
It's possible
that she could actually go for you.

33:05.110 --> 33:09.573
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...

33:09.656 --> 33:10.949
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:11.033 --> 33:14.161
- Twice a week. Free weights.
- Okay. All right.

33:14.286 --> 33:16.872
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.

33:16.955 --> 33:18.248
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.042
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.252
All we got to do is find a way
to get you two together, you know?

33:22.294 --> 33:27.257
At her apartment, you show up as
the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...

33:27.299 --> 33:29.927
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.

33:29.968 --> 33:34.389
I was inclined to regard this injury
as the result of attempts by plunderers

33:34.473 --> 33:37.142
to hastily remove
the wrappings from the mummy.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.268
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

33:38.310 --> 33:39.811
I'm gonna go over there
when she's finished,

33:39.853 --> 33:42.523
and strike up a conversation with her.

33:43.690 --> 33:45.442
- Yeah.
- I know.

33:47.069 --> 33:49.488
- What?
- I don't know.

33:49.571 --> 33:52.199
I'm just thinking,
in the smock, better not.

33:52.282 --> 33:53.617
- Yes. I came straight from work.
- Okay.

33:53.659 --> 33:56.662
- I'm a dentist. This is what we wear.
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:56.745 --> 34:00.249
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.

34:01.250 --> 34:05.003
And remember that the show officially
opens on Friday, the 12th.

34:05.087 --> 34:07.881
Thank you,
thank you very much for coming.

34:14.513 --> 34:17.683
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.

34:17.766 --> 34:20.060
- Oh, really? Did she?
- Oh, yeah.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.981
Good, all right.

34:27.359 --> 34:29.360
I owe you an apology.

34:31.697 --> 34:35.659
Do you mean for stealing my cab
or for not holding the elevator?

34:36.368 --> 34:37.911
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no. I know.

34:37.995 --> 34:39.580
Maybe it was for that time that

34:39.663 --> 34:42.666
you told the super that
somebody down on nine was cooking

34:42.708 --> 34:46.043
stenchy ethnic food
that stings the eyes?

34:46.128 --> 34:48.422
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.

34:48.505 --> 34:52.426
They told me that any complaints
would be kept anonymous.

34:52.551 --> 34:56.513
Or, you know, maybe it was for
the eight or ten times that I said,

34:56.597 --> 35:00.309
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever,
and you never even looked at me.

35:00.726 --> 35:02.686
I'm a very private person.

35:02.728 --> 35:05.731
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.

35:07.065 --> 35:09.693
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.

35:12.905 --> 35:16.950
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.

35:17.951 --> 35:22.414
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.

35:22.456 --> 35:26.043
But, you know,
thank you for that encouragement.

35:26.126 --> 35:29.087
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?

35:32.424 --> 35:34.551
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?

35:34.635 --> 35:37.596
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.

35:37.679 --> 35:39.389
He was no flosser.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.101
Dental humor.

35:45.229 --> 35:47.231
Is there something else?

35:50.859 --> 35:56.240
Shoes. Your shoes are comfortable.

35:57.282 --> 35:58.408
Bye.

36:02.454 --> 36:04.373
<i>I knew you were gonna come off scary.</i>

36:04.456 --> 36:06.583
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.

36:06.667 --> 36:09.253
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!

36:09.336 --> 36:10.921
Don't make eye contact.

36:11.004 --> 36:13.298
Let me... No, no, no.
Let me preface this.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.217
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.900
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- No, no.

36:16.927 --> 36:19.054
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.

36:19.137 --> 36:20.848
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.

36:20.931 --> 36:24.142
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?

36:24.226 --> 36:27.312
What's the drama? Some big, bad lady
went and broke your heart?

36:27.437 --> 36:28.605
Well, get over it. It's in the past.

36:28.689 --> 36:29.982
You know nothing about my past,
do you?

36:30.065 --> 36:32.442
I know you got to forget about this
and let it go.

36:32.484 --> 36:33.861
It's not helping you out there.

36:33.944 --> 36:35.404
Listen, the thing with women
is that they...

36:35.487 --> 36:38.115
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.

36:39.158 --> 36:41.618
You know, for the sake of time,
I'm gonna agree with that insane point,

36:41.660 --> 36:43.912
and say, "Yeah, you do great
with women. You do great."

36:43.996 --> 36:47.166
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.

36:49.418 --> 36:51.170
And she likes a man who's a man.

36:51.211 --> 36:54.423
She likes you to order for her
in a restaurant. And don't get bossy!

36:54.506 --> 36:55.966
Don't ever tell her
to take it easy, Pincus.

36:56.049 --> 36:58.760
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.

36:58.844 --> 37:01.180
I do know how to talk to people.

37:02.014 --> 37:05.434
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you? Yeah.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.269
Once you're with her,
you got to show her you care.

37:07.352 --> 37:09.688
You got to be jealous,
got to be suspicious.

37:09.771 --> 37:11.815
Why on earth would I do that?

37:11.857 --> 37:13.317
'Cause it shows you're interested.

37:13.358 --> 37:17.112
This is the worst advice
I've ever had in my life.

37:17.196 --> 37:19.823
But she's jealous, too,
and she's no dummy.

37:19.865 --> 37:24.119
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise
one eyebrow and cock her head.

37:24.203 --> 37:27.664
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.

37:30.626 --> 37:32.878
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.214
Don't be silly. Get in here.

37:35.255 --> 37:37.049
I don't want to... Okay.

37:38.217 --> 37:39.384
Pincus.

37:41.053 --> 37:45.057
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.

37:45.140 --> 37:48.143
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?

37:48.227 --> 37:52.564
Don't do this. And get that face off.
You're not... Don't do it!

37:53.524 --> 37:57.194
I've been thinking
about your decaying jawbone.

37:57.236 --> 37:58.445
Pitting is what I'm talking.

37:58.529 --> 37:59.863
Saw it on the slideshow,

37:59.905 --> 38:04.243
which would indicate to me,
a trained dentist, some bone loss,

38:04.284 --> 38:07.663
and on the upper left
mandibular gum line.

38:07.746 --> 38:08.914
The mummy.

38:08.997 --> 38:12.125
Open invitation to a little vitis
called "Gingi."

38:12.209 --> 38:13.585
Gingivitis?

38:14.461 --> 38:18.090
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...

38:19.216 --> 38:22.928
Check out the mandibular bone loss,
if I...

38:23.011 --> 38:26.181
But wouldn't that just be
ordinary wear and tear?

38:27.724 --> 38:30.727
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.

38:30.769 --> 38:32.396
I don't think so.

38:32.437 --> 38:35.107
How do the ladies resist
that rap of yours?

38:41.905 --> 38:45.576
All right, all right. Not a total disaster.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.911
Next time, you just got to listen
to what it is that I'm saying.

38:47.953 --> 38:49.788
Excuse me?

38:49.830 --> 38:54.418
Do you think maybe you could come by
someday and maybe examine him?

38:54.501 --> 38:56.670
Let's have a look, shall we?

39:01.967 --> 39:03.468
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:03.552 --> 39:06.555
No, today's out, tomorrow is out. That.

39:06.638 --> 39:10.767
Cannot move that. Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.

39:10.851 --> 39:14.062
And that little puppy
is hunkered in good.

39:14.146 --> 39:16.106
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.

39:16.982 --> 39:22.946
I don't want to move that,
but I can't do that, either.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.448
Busy bee.

39:24.490 --> 39:27.117
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments

39:27.201 --> 39:28.869
abound.

39:29.661 --> 39:35.584
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...

39:37.836 --> 39:41.715
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...

39:42.508 --> 39:46.553
- Great. Okay.
- Good. See you then.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.530
Way to go, Frank. Oh, God.

40:08.826 --> 40:09.866
Oh, thank God you're back.

40:09.910 --> 40:12.162
You left the newspaper
on a cell phone ad, you sadist!

40:12.204 --> 40:14.206
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.

40:14.248 --> 40:16.375
I'm not in the mood anymore.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.254
Where have you been?

40:20.337 --> 40:23.841
I sit around here all day long,
and you're out God knows where.

40:23.924 --> 40:26.051
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.053
Hey, is that a new shirt?

40:28.095 --> 40:30.764
Hey, it is a new shirt,
and it's got sleeves.

40:30.848 --> 40:34.935
Well, well, well. Pinky's got himself
a brand new shirt for the big...

41:03.255 --> 41:05.382
Hi. Hi.

41:07.342 --> 41:08.760
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.

41:16.518 --> 41:18.645
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?

41:18.729 --> 41:22.107
You should have seen the state
he was in when we found him.

41:22.191 --> 41:25.986
Blackened skin, multiple fractures
from extensive marauding,

41:26.069 --> 41:27.446
fully retreated lips.

41:27.529 --> 41:30.908
Five thousand years of acid reflux
will do that to you.

41:32.951 --> 41:37.372
Deep down, you know, the preservation
was exquisite New Kingdom work,

41:37.456 --> 41:40.125
and it's what's underneath that counts.

41:40.959 --> 41:44.254
First, they suctioned his brain out
through his nose.

41:44.296 --> 41:46.757
And then they make a slit
in the side of the abdomen,

41:46.798 --> 41:50.511
so that they can remove
the stomach, liver, intestines...

41:50.594 --> 41:51.678
Beautiful.

41:51.762 --> 41:54.202
So that they could be separately
preserved in Canopic jars.

41:54.264 --> 41:58.268
But what's really exciting about Pepi is
how they handled his organ.

41:58.393 --> 42:00.479
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.

42:01.146 --> 42:03.774
I got it right here. You wanna see it?

42:05.484 --> 42:06.693
Please.

42:07.694 --> 42:11.532
There's nothing unusual
about the phallus itself.

42:11.615 --> 42:13.283
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.

42:13.325 --> 42:15.911
You know, normally, the penis
and the heart are kept together

42:15.994 --> 42:17.955
and mummified along with the body,

42:18.038 --> 42:19.164
but in Pepi's case,

42:19.248 --> 42:24.545
they removed it and preserved it
in this separate gold-encrusted jar.

42:25.963 --> 42:29.216
God. I can see why he was king.

42:29.299 --> 42:30.384
- You okay?
- Yeah.

42:30.467 --> 42:33.053
I've got to get used to looking down
at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.

42:33.136 --> 42:36.390
Oh, geez. I see he died happy.

42:38.016 --> 42:39.977
That's it. That's enough.

42:40.018 --> 42:41.311
He must have had huge hands.

42:41.353 --> 42:43.355
- No, no.
- Yeah.

42:43.397 --> 42:45.691
Is this here the pitting
that you were referring to?

42:45.732 --> 42:50.028
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.

42:50.112 --> 42:52.656
We just assumed
that was post-mortal decay.

42:52.739 --> 42:54.783
Don't be naive.

42:54.867 --> 42:57.286
That is the work
of an untreated abscess.

42:57.369 --> 43:00.747
That was a absolute magic carpet
of bacterial infection.

43:00.831 --> 43:01.999
And that could have killed him?

43:02.040 --> 43:04.710
Yeah, if it was severe, that would
have led to something more systemic,

43:04.793 --> 43:07.087
and as soon as the infection
hit the spinal column,

43:07.171 --> 43:10.257
he'd have pennies on his eyes
in no time at all.

43:10.340 --> 43:12.843
Well, the mouth. A coin in the mouth.

43:12.926 --> 43:14.970
It was a Greek tradition, you know,

43:15.053 --> 43:18.182
to pay the boatman to ferry you across
the River Styx, but...

43:18.265 --> 43:20.225
I mean,
this is an amazing breakthrough,

43:20.309 --> 43:22.519
and just in time
for our opening next Thursday.

43:22.561 --> 43:24.730
- Hey, will you come?
- What?

43:24.813 --> 43:26.857
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.525
- No. That's...
- You don't like crowds?

43:28.609 --> 43:33.030
It's not so much the crowd as
the individuals in the crowd I don't like.

43:33.572 --> 43:36.325
Well, if you change your mind,
you let me know.

43:37.493 --> 43:41.413
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?

43:41.455 --> 43:44.625
Everybody waits until it's too late.

43:44.708 --> 43:46.710
So you're a funny dentist.

43:48.712 --> 43:50.255
You wanna touch him?

43:50.339 --> 43:52.633
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.

43:52.716 --> 43:56.136
- No, no. Really, really touch him. Yeah.
- More, yeah.

43:56.261 --> 43:58.222
- No, like...
- Down there.

43:58.305 --> 44:01.558
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow. Brilliant.

44:04.436 --> 44:06.897
Don't you just love that smell?

44:07.648 --> 44:10.526
It's not decay. It's the resin. It's pine.

44:10.609 --> 44:13.529
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.

44:14.780 --> 44:18.367
After a couple of hours,
the smell that was initially so sweet,

44:18.450 --> 44:20.869
it triggers your vomit impulse.

44:20.953 --> 44:22.996
Like visiting your grandmother.

44:29.294 --> 44:30.921
Sugar-free treat?

44:32.297 --> 44:34.424
Sure. Okay.

44:36.510 --> 44:38.637
It's sweetened with Splenda.

44:44.059 --> 44:46.019
Surprisingly delightful.

44:47.187 --> 44:50.858
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.

44:50.941 --> 44:53.944
Originally born and raised in England,
obviously, and then...

44:53.986 --> 44:58.532
- Why'd you move?
- London. Just too much.

44:58.615 --> 45:03.120
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.

45:03.203 --> 45:05.622
So you picked Manhattan?

45:05.664 --> 45:09.835
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.

45:10.836 --> 45:12.921
- What's her name?
- Sarah.

45:13.005 --> 45:14.006
- Wife?
- No.

45:14.047 --> 45:15.507
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

45:15.591 --> 45:17.134
Still together?

45:17.885 --> 45:20.804
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.

45:21.638 --> 45:24.141
No, she died, actually. Quite sad.

45:24.183 --> 45:28.020
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?

45:28.061 --> 45:30.063
She actually ate herself.

45:32.024 --> 45:34.193
I made that up. I was joking.

45:35.027 --> 45:37.946
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.

45:38.030 --> 45:42.075
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.

45:43.952 --> 45:45.954
How long you been here?

45:47.372 --> 45:48.707
Can you just hold on one second?

45:48.790 --> 45:51.877
This is so stupid,
but my keychain broke,

45:51.960 --> 45:54.463
and I can never find my keys.

45:54.546 --> 45:59.468
I moved back to the city about
a year ago, just after my husband died.

46:00.302 --> 46:03.055
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.

46:03.096 --> 46:04.348
Thanks.

46:06.725 --> 46:10.854
I want to ask you something,
and you tell me if it's inappropriate.

46:11.522 --> 46:12.648
Okay.

46:14.066 --> 46:15.192
Okay.

46:17.110 --> 46:18.654
This tooth.

46:18.737 --> 46:22.574
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...

46:22.616 --> 46:26.745
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.

46:26.829 --> 46:30.165
Let's have a look.
Head back. Open wide.

46:30.249 --> 46:32.209
You want me to say, "Ah"?

46:35.295 --> 46:36.588
Hey, Dentist!

46:36.630 --> 46:37.923
I need you to clip a guy for me.

46:38.006 --> 46:40.133
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.

46:40.217 --> 46:41.257
You see, Dentist, in life,

46:41.301 --> 46:43.595
I accepted payment for a job
which I wasn't able to complete.

46:43.679 --> 46:46.932
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?

46:46.974 --> 46:48.574
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?

46:48.600 --> 46:49.643
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.

46:49.726 --> 46:52.604
There's a. 38 snub-nose taped
under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.

46:52.646 --> 46:55.607
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.

46:55.649 --> 46:57.442
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.

46:58.861 --> 47:02.114
- What the...
- Is now a good time?

47:02.906 --> 47:04.283
Is everything okay?

47:04.366 --> 47:06.618
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little... Oh, geez.

47:06.702 --> 47:08.954
Oh, no, don't... Careful.

47:08.996 --> 47:10.455
Look, right in the ear nearly.

47:10.497 --> 47:13.125
It's just... I saw you talking to
Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...

47:13.208 --> 47:16.128
Hi, there. Hey!

47:16.170 --> 47:18.672
Good. Another one.

47:18.755 --> 47:22.217
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey! I didn't see you.

47:22.301 --> 47:23.927
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.

47:24.469 --> 47:27.639
Why did this fellow have his hands
in your mouth?

47:29.141 --> 47:31.810
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard,
my fiancй.

47:32.644 --> 47:33.896
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus,

47:33.979 --> 47:35.772
that dentist that I told you about
in the building.

47:35.814 --> 47:39.151
I think he's got a really terrific idea
about what might have killed Pepi.

47:39.234 --> 47:40.777
Really? That's fantastic.

47:40.861 --> 47:43.280
You know, I've been needing
to find a dentist, myself.

47:43.322 --> 47:46.950
Why don't you join us for dinner
tomorrow night, Doctor? At Gwen's.

47:47.034 --> 47:48.702
I'm making curry.

47:49.119 --> 47:51.497
- She's really cute.
- Don't...

47:52.206 --> 47:54.166
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.

47:54.958 --> 47:57.836
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.

47:58.795 --> 48:00.172
Thank you.

48:02.674 --> 48:05.761
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.

48:05.844 --> 48:08.639
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.

48:10.349 --> 48:14.311
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.

48:14.394 --> 48:18.357
I had a friend
who was generous with her time.

48:18.398 --> 48:20.192
Richard's being modest.

48:20.234 --> 48:23.737
He worked for three years
with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.

48:23.862 --> 48:26.448
You still in the sex trade or...

48:28.200 --> 48:30.327
That's inappropriate.

48:34.206 --> 48:35.499
You know, Doctor,

48:35.541 --> 48:39.294
I confess an ulterior motive
in asking you here tonight.

48:40.379 --> 48:41.505
As a dentist,

48:41.547 --> 48:44.049
you could do an awful lot of good
in the developing world.

48:44.132 --> 48:46.093
They're in desperate need
of modern dental care.

48:46.176 --> 48:48.053
"Modern dental care."
You believe this guy?

48:48.095 --> 48:51.390
Now, the political will is there,
the money's there.

48:51.431 --> 48:53.433
What an act. So pompous!

48:54.184 --> 48:56.895
- Sorry. What is that?
- My new puppy.

48:56.979 --> 48:59.022
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.

48:59.064 --> 49:01.400
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...

49:01.441 --> 49:03.068
- Come on!
Are boots on the ground.

49:03.152 --> 49:04.820
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!

49:04.903 --> 49:07.239
How can teeth be self-righteous?

49:10.659 --> 49:16.331
Is a strange thing for a dentist
to burst out with over curry,

49:16.415 --> 49:20.210
but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.

49:20.252 --> 49:22.171
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.

49:22.254 --> 49:25.674
What is essentially dentin and enamel

49:25.757 --> 49:29.970
outcrops from various mandibles
are inanimate,

49:30.053 --> 49:31.597
and therefore, have no moral code.

49:31.680 --> 49:35.934
All they can do is chew and grind,
and that's passive.

49:35.976 --> 49:39.646
It's mainly
the cheek muscles do that, from...

49:40.522 --> 49:42.149
What were you saying?

49:42.232 --> 49:46.737
I was... I was... I was saying, we need...

49:46.820 --> 49:50.991
We need people like you
who can bring their expertise to bear

49:51.074 --> 49:54.745
in places like Peru,
Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.

49:54.786 --> 50:00.584
Mainly those sort of really hot,
sticky places.

50:00.626 --> 50:03.879
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.

50:03.962 --> 50:08.884
I mean, what is the dental care like in,
say, I don't know, Palm Springs?

50:08.967 --> 50:10.219
There's breezes.

50:10.302 --> 50:13.222
You know,
what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?

50:13.305 --> 50:16.225
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.

50:16.308 --> 50:18.185
Shrugging and smiling.

50:22.064 --> 50:23.982
He's kidding, sweetie.

50:35.327 --> 50:37.663
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

50:38.747 --> 50:41.124
Boy, he'd be handy
on a camping trip, huh?

50:41.166 --> 50:42.668
Do you want some more wine?

50:42.709 --> 50:45.295
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.

50:45.420 --> 50:46.505
Okay.

50:50.551 --> 50:53.136
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.

50:53.679 --> 50:55.472
- Shut...
- What?

50:55.514 --> 50:57.182
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?

50:57.266 --> 51:00.644
If I am, just give me a fake cough
and I'll...

51:02.271 --> 51:04.189
Okay, was that...

51:04.231 --> 51:07.317
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay! I'm gone.

51:11.780 --> 51:16.660
Richard's a human rights lawyer,
so, well, he takes his job very seriously.

51:16.702 --> 51:18.453
Oh, well, so you should
with human rights.

51:18.537 --> 51:20.330
I take human rights seriously.

51:20.372 --> 51:25.169
You know, everybody's equal,
color, creed or circumstance.

51:26.253 --> 51:28.881
We're all the same on this planet.

51:31.049 --> 51:33.510
- Except the Chinese.
- What?

51:33.552 --> 51:36.346
No, they are. They're the odd ones out
if you had to pick one.

51:36.388 --> 51:37.973
No, I'm not having a go.

51:38.056 --> 51:40.184
I'm just saying, you know,
not their faces.

51:40.267 --> 51:42.186
I mean... No, no.
But they call each other

51:42.227 --> 51:43.395
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it. You're gonna...

51:43.479 --> 51:46.023
and that's their choice,
and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.

51:46.106 --> 51:48.692
And they... No.
Some people are called Pong...

51:48.775 --> 51:51.236
- Stop, please, stop.
And there's about a million Wangs.

51:51.278 --> 51:52.696
You can have... You have one kid,

51:52.738 --> 51:54.865
you can use all those names
on one little...

51:54.948 --> 51:58.160
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.

51:58.243 --> 52:01.705
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park
have been arrested in Shaolin.

52:01.747 --> 52:04.166
I have to get down to the office.

52:05.542 --> 52:07.377
Well, they're being arraigned
in 30 minutes

52:07.419 --> 52:08.754
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.

52:08.795 --> 52:11.048
Their attorneys to appear
by closed-circuit.

52:11.089 --> 52:12.216
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.

52:12.299 --> 52:13.884
Doctor, it's been a...

52:13.926 --> 52:19.056
Yeah, so you guys stay
and have fun and finish up.

52:24.186 --> 52:26.605
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?

52:26.688 --> 52:29.399
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.

52:35.656 --> 52:37.449
When did you get your horse?

52:37.533 --> 52:38.951
A couple of months ago.

52:39.034 --> 52:40.994
I found him at this shelter
in Long Island.

52:41.078 --> 52:43.372
They were gonna put him down.

52:43.455 --> 52:45.916
Then they lost their nerve, did they?

52:48.627 --> 52:51.129
The smell? Yeah, I know.

52:51.213 --> 52:55.259
His mood levelers give him
this ulcerating skin rash.

53:04.977 --> 53:06.436
Are you okay?

53:07.980 --> 53:10.607
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.

53:10.691 --> 53:13.652
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.

53:16.572 --> 53:19.783
- Are you all right? Do you want to...
- Sorry.

53:20.951 --> 53:22.661
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.

53:22.744 --> 53:26.039
Do you want to maybe walk him now
or we could finish up and...

53:26.123 --> 53:30.794
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.

53:49.605 --> 53:52.858
Leonard, you good boy!

53:52.900 --> 53:54.985
That is so healthy!

53:55.027 --> 53:58.906
Good, good boy! That's a good boy!

53:58.989 --> 54:00.991
That's a good boy!

54:02.284 --> 54:04.536
You wanna finish dinner?

54:04.578 --> 54:07.164
I don't think I'm quite ready for
solid foods just yet.

54:07.247 --> 54:09.750
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.

54:11.376 --> 54:13.712
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.

54:13.754 --> 54:16.590
Or, no, have you ever been
to that new...

54:23.722 --> 54:25.641
I know, yeah. No, I like Sting

54:25.724 --> 54:27.644
because you can hear
he's educated in his lyrics.

54:27.726 --> 54:30.562
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.

54:30.604 --> 54:33.690
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.

54:33.732 --> 54:35.359
Thank you.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.236
You know,
that was Frank's favorite drink.

54:37.277 --> 54:39.196
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Sorry.

54:39.238 --> 54:40.572
You forgot?

54:41.406 --> 54:42.991
You forgot what?

54:44.201 --> 54:46.578
Forgot? Yeah.

54:47.621 --> 54:48.861
You recently lost your husband,

54:48.872 --> 54:50.624
and the polite thing to do
in this situation

54:50.707 --> 54:53.168
would have been to check
what the deceased's drink was

54:53.252 --> 54:57.714
as not to evoke any horrible memories.

54:57.756 --> 55:00.592
Why would you assume
that they were horrible?

55:00.676 --> 55:03.387
Painful. Not necessarily horrible.

55:03.428 --> 55:08.058
Just all the memories, nonetheless,
of drink-related death memory.

55:10.978 --> 55:12.312
I like a Pimm's Cup.

55:12.396 --> 55:15.941
This is exactly the kind of girly drink
that Frank would have teased me about.

55:16.024 --> 55:20.529
Once when we were in Anguilla,
I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.

55:20.612 --> 55:23.448
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter,

55:23.532 --> 55:25.284
and he grabs him
by the lapels and he goes,

55:25.325 --> 55:27.119
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."

55:27.161 --> 55:28.620
Oh, for God's sake!

55:28.662 --> 55:30.789
Sorry. Just running
on about my dead husband.

55:30.873 --> 55:34.126
No, no, no, it wasn't you. No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate. It's...

55:34.168 --> 55:36.378
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.

55:36.461 --> 55:39.131
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?

55:39.214 --> 55:41.341
No, no, no. He should leave.

55:42.593 --> 55:46.263
Let's do some... You were saying that
Frank had his flaws.

55:46.305 --> 55:48.265
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy

55:48.307 --> 55:50.434
because you should not
romanticize the dead.

55:50.517 --> 55:52.686
You should remember their faults.

55:52.769 --> 55:55.772
Oh, well, I remember them.

55:55.856 --> 55:58.442
Oh, good. Well, let's make a list.

55:59.568 --> 56:00.944
What the hell do you think you're doing?

56:00.986 --> 56:04.573
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me. I'm a dentist.

56:04.656 --> 56:06.492
- Come on, then.
- Okay.

56:07.159 --> 56:09.286
His faults. Number one.

56:09.328 --> 56:12.164
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.

56:12.664 --> 56:13.665
Well, that's what made me successful.

56:13.749 --> 56:15.542
But that's probably why
he was so good at his job, so...

56:15.626 --> 56:18.504
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.

56:18.587 --> 56:21.298
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.

56:21.340 --> 56:22.508
Regularly, I imagine.

56:22.591 --> 56:23.926
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious."

56:24.009 --> 56:25.761
That didn't count, Pincus.

56:25.844 --> 56:28.514
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?

56:28.597 --> 56:32.476
Oh, be quiet! Let them talk.
You could learn something.

56:33.268 --> 56:35.479
He had a shoe fetish.

56:35.521 --> 56:38.607
That is so embarrassing,
because it starts on shoes,

56:38.690 --> 56:42.778
and go to gloves
and hats and socks, up the...

56:42.861 --> 56:44.613
Right. "Pervert."

56:44.696 --> 56:48.659
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.

56:48.700 --> 56:51.453
- So do I.
- You mind?

56:51.537 --> 56:53.080
Because they're just doing a job,
aren't they?

56:53.163 --> 56:54.456
What a nasty piece of work.

56:54.540 --> 56:56.375
So what about
his physical characteristics?

56:56.458 --> 56:58.418
I'll bet he was really into fitness,

56:58.502 --> 57:00.879
because he was
a scrawny little runt, was he?

57:00.921 --> 57:02.923
No, but, you know,
he was actually starting

57:03.006 --> 57:05.217
to get into yoga at the end there.

57:05.300 --> 57:08.929
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.

57:09.012 --> 57:11.056
Yeah. Okay, this is shaping up nicely.

57:11.139 --> 57:15.269
So now we've got
a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert

57:15.352 --> 57:16.812
who's rude to waiters.

57:16.895 --> 57:18.230
It's a good list.

57:18.313 --> 57:20.858
I don't have to listen to this shit.

57:21.567 --> 57:22.901
Disloyal.

57:34.997 --> 57:37.374
Yeah, I think that's enough.

57:43.922 --> 57:45.841
I didn't know you knew.

57:47.634 --> 57:52.097
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?

57:53.932 --> 57:56.059
I didn't get the chance to say,
"Hey, go to hell,"

57:56.143 --> 57:59.438
you know, "I want a divorce,"
like a normal person.

58:06.653 --> 58:08.697
Well, I'm sorry. I...

58:08.780 --> 58:11.116
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.

58:26.298 --> 58:30.010
She used to travel
a lot for her work, Sarah.

58:31.303 --> 58:35.265
And the trips got longer and longer.

58:35.307 --> 58:38.852
And then one trip,
she didn't come back at all.

58:40.604 --> 58:42.606
Married a man in Portland.

58:45.275 --> 58:46.610
Sorry.

58:51.865 --> 58:54.660
Travel will do that to a relationship.

58:56.537 --> 58:57.913
Yep.

58:57.996 --> 59:01.375
I just got this amazing offer
to go map tombs

59:01.458 --> 59:04.628
in the Valley of the Kings for six months.

59:04.670 --> 59:07.381
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.

59:09.508 --> 59:11.260
Because of Richard.

59:12.427 --> 59:13.637
Yeah.

59:15.514 --> 59:17.516
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:22.020 --> 59:25.816
Your story, it's not boring
and ordinary, by the way.

59:26.608 --> 59:29.319
I mean, we just get the one life,
you know?

59:29.361 --> 59:33.824
Just one. You can't live someone else's
or think it's more important,

59:33.866 --> 59:35.909
just because it's more dramatic.

59:35.993 --> 59:37.828
What happens matters.

59:38.704 --> 59:42.040
Maybe only to us, but it matters.

59:43.584 --> 59:45.085
Good night.

59:46.170 --> 59:47.546
Good night.

59:58.891 --> 01:00:00.058
What?

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:02.773
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.

01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:04.021
You're weaseling your way
right in there.

01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:05.522
This is gonna work.

01:00:05.564 --> 01:00:09.359
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.

01:00:10.569 --> 01:00:12.154
You know he's a human rights lawyer.

01:00:12.237 --> 01:00:13.572
Hey, when the devil shows up,

01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:16.366
you think he's gonna have
little red horns and carry a pitchfork?

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.410
No, he's gonna work for
Amnesty International,

01:00:18.452 --> 01:00:20.412
and he's gonna give
all of his money to the homeless.

01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:24.166
Well, if he did all that,
wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?

01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:25.334
You know what I mean.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:26.877
Pincus, I got better things
to do with my time.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.545
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.

01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:30.881
What, exactly,
is your problem with Richard?

01:00:30.923 --> 01:00:32.257
I told you!

01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:34.384
The guy is setting her up
to rob her blind.

01:00:34.468 --> 01:00:36.094
And what proof have you got? I don't...

01:00:36.178 --> 01:00:37.596
What are you basing this on?

01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:41.225
I saw things with my own two eyes.

01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:43.811
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.

01:00:43.936 --> 01:00:45.896
Come on. What did he do?

01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:49.650
Well, that's... He's...

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:52.110
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?

01:00:52.194 --> 01:00:53.529
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.

01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:54.905
- Yeah.
- And the check came,

01:00:54.947 --> 01:00:58.826
and this clown says
that his wallet is in his coat.

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:00.869
It's over at the coat check.

01:01:00.953 --> 01:01:02.329
- How convenient, right?
- Right.

01:01:02.412 --> 01:01:03.914
So he goes over to go get it,

01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:06.416
makes a big show
about the whole thing, too,

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:10.337
and she says, "No, no, let me get this."

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:15.759
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:20.138
There's nothing
wrong with him, is there?

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:22.724
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.

01:01:22.808 --> 01:01:23.976
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:25.978
Listen, he's a perfectly
lovely human being.

01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:27.896
Pincus, there are other things!

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.315
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?

01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:32.442
Yeah. $5,000.

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:34.324
I saw her write the check
with my own two eyes,

01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:37.573
put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...

01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:40.325
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?

01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:42.077
Or shaking the money tree,
see what drops.

01:01:42.161 --> 01:01:43.245
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:44.621
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.

01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:46.123
Refugees?

01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:49.001
Orphans? Orphans. Good.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.402
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.714
- You really are. This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:57.593
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights
of the underprivileged. Come on!

01:01:57.676 --> 01:01:59.595
There must be
something wrong with him.

01:01:59.678 --> 01:02:02.181
There must be some reason
why all this is happening.

01:02:02.264 --> 01:02:05.476
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

01:02:07.352 --> 01:02:08.854
I'm out.

01:02:08.937 --> 01:02:11.815
What? No, no. What do you mean?

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:15.611
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere
with Gwen's life anymore.

01:02:15.694 --> 01:02:17.154
And I can't lie to her.

01:02:17.237 --> 01:02:18.989
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me,

01:02:19.031 --> 01:02:20.532
and I nearly confessed
to everything there and then.

01:02:20.616 --> 01:02:22.659
You can't abandon her to this creep.

01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:24.578
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!

01:02:24.661 --> 01:02:26.830
I haven't seen her laugh
once with this guy!

01:02:26.914 --> 01:02:28.665
He's a good man.

01:02:28.707 --> 01:02:32.169
You actually like him,
with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?

01:02:32.211 --> 01:02:33.712
I hate him. Okay?

01:02:33.754 --> 01:02:37.966
I want to run him over
with his own little stupid, electric car.

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:39.092
But he's what Gwen wants.

01:02:39.176 --> 01:02:41.720
And after what
she's been through with you,

01:02:41.803 --> 01:02:44.431
she deserves a bit of happiness.

01:02:44.515 --> 01:02:46.475
You're in love with her.

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:51.939
You are. I knew it.

01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:58.111
That little Grinch heart of yours
actually started beating,

01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:01.114
and now you want to take it back
to your cave and crush it with a rock.

01:03:01.198 --> 01:03:03.200
That's what you wanna do.

01:03:03.992 --> 01:03:06.286
- I quit.
- You can't quit.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.789
I'll make your life a living hell.

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:12.501
It already is.

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:41.238
There you go. That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.

01:03:41.321 --> 01:03:44.658
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.

01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:47.619
Come on. Come on, sweetie. Come on.

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:51.081
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk. Come on.

01:03:51.123 --> 01:03:55.377
God damn it. Come on. Come on.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.173
You don't wanna wait until
it's too late, do you, sweetie?

01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:03.135
Wait.

01:04:04.678 --> 01:04:08.265
Leonard! It is too late.

01:04:14.438 --> 01:04:15.856
Too late.

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:22.821
And so Alex says to me,

01:04:22.905 --> 01:04:26.325
"Mommy, I know that babies come
from inside a lady's tummy,

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:30.078
"but what I really want to know is,
how do they get there?"

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:32.539
Can you believe? And, of course,

01:04:32.623 --> 01:04:33.874
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.792
But I have to come up with something,
because his father...

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:39.796
Oh, no talking,
not when we're popping this in.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.215
- Okay.
- Bite down there.

01:04:41.298 --> 01:04:43.759
There you go. Good.

01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:45.719
Just leave that there.

01:04:46.512 --> 01:04:49.640
Isn't that good? So much better.

01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:55.479
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting
my ears and we're all winners.

01:04:58.023 --> 01:04:59.817
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.

01:04:59.858 --> 01:05:01.819
Mr. Harriman's bridge
is on the verge of...

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.488
I thought I was through
for the day after this.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.282
- You are through.
- What about the...

01:05:10.494 --> 01:05:12.120
What about what?

01:05:12.663 --> 01:05:14.331
- Frank.
- Who?

01:05:15.249 --> 01:05:17.000
I don't know who you mean.

01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:18.877
What are you... Who? I've never...

01:05:18.919 --> 01:05:22.172
Okay, my opinion is that
you didn't make sense just now.

01:05:22.214 --> 01:05:23.757
Well, I don't know
who you're talking about.

01:05:23.841 --> 01:05:27.010
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:28.720
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!

01:05:28.804 --> 01:05:31.515
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.

01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:45.362
He's not in the office!

01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:53.078
Well, then he must be upstairs.

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:00.544
Good afternoon, Doctor.

01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:02.963
Good to see you. You look smart.

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.181
Just been to the toilet.

01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:16.018
Different route back, around the...

01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:19.313
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought,
so I just took my time.

01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:22.065
I mean, you can take a long time
next time if you...

01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:26.445
Good. Okay.

01:06:27.946 --> 01:06:29.281
That's set.

01:06:30.574 --> 01:06:32.409
Okay, it has to be...

01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:35.120
Good.

01:06:35.204 --> 01:06:37.915
Can you take a new walk-in
before you leave, Dr. Pincus?

01:06:37.956 --> 01:06:40.417
He seems to be in a lot of pain.

01:06:40.459 --> 01:06:42.336
Life is pain.

01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:46.131
Does that mean yes?

01:06:47.716 --> 01:06:50.928
So we have an emergency
on our hands. I'm Dr. Pincus.

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.430
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:56.433
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.

01:06:56.475 --> 01:06:57.935
What seems to be the problem?

01:06:57.976 --> 01:07:01.104
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.

01:07:01.188 --> 01:07:02.731
That was silly.

01:07:03.899 --> 01:07:05.609
Head back.

01:07:05.692 --> 01:07:08.487
Let's have a look, shall we? Open up.

01:07:10.072 --> 01:07:11.698
Oh, yeah, there it is.

01:07:11.782 --> 01:07:13.784
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.

01:07:13.826 --> 01:07:14.993
Have you been chewing seal hide?

01:07:15.077 --> 01:07:16.957
Yeah, well,
I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard

01:07:16.995 --> 01:07:19.414
when I'm stressed and I'm...

01:07:19.498 --> 01:07:21.583
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.

01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:24.086
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?

01:07:25.254 --> 01:07:27.297
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.

01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:29.383
No, you were gonna
say something about...

01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:31.426
Well, she was just...

01:07:33.345 --> 01:07:35.681
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.

01:07:35.764 --> 01:07:37.015
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:38.183
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something

01:07:38.267 --> 01:07:40.310
or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...

01:07:40.352 --> 01:07:41.812
- It's personal.
- I know that,

01:07:41.854 --> 01:07:43.480
but, I mean just to...

01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:44.682
I'd rather not talk about it.

01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:47.234
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.

01:07:47.317 --> 01:07:50.487
- I'm a good listener. Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:52.030
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?

01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:53.907
- I'm in pain.
- Please.

01:07:58.287 --> 01:07:59.872
Dr. Prashar?

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:07.671
Jahangir? That's his first name.

01:08:10.757 --> 01:08:13.552
You're from a scary country, aren't you?

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.138
Excuse me.

01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:18.640
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.

01:08:18.724 --> 01:08:21.185
So you're not a Christian, like us.

01:08:22.935 --> 01:08:24.645
No, I'm a Hindu.

01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:31.153
How would you extract information
from a hostile?

01:08:34.615 --> 01:08:37.826
Well, as a Hindu person,

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.705
I would ask them politely.

01:08:43.999 --> 01:08:47.752
Yeah, I just need a technique.

01:08:47.836 --> 01:08:51.340
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:08:56.011 --> 01:08:57.179
So where were we?

01:08:57.261 --> 01:08:58.982
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...

01:08:59.014 --> 01:09:02.100
- No, I wasn't. I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:05.479
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.

01:09:05.562 --> 01:09:11.234
All work and no play makes Jack
a valuable member of society.

01:09:12.486 --> 01:09:13.862
Open up.

01:09:16.156 --> 01:09:19.618
- That hurts.
- Did it? Well, take your word for that.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:22.746
But it almost certainly would
in this situation.

01:09:23.788 --> 01:09:27.501
Do you know the worst thing
in the world for teeth?

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:29.962
- Sugar?
- Secrets.

01:09:31.046 --> 01:09:32.881
If you tell me what's on your mind,
you will feel better.

01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:35.843
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:38.845
I really would like to keep this
on a professional footing.

01:09:38.929 --> 01:09:40.346
Yes, please.

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:44.768
We can play it any way you want to.

01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:50.189
Actually.

01:09:57.698 --> 01:09:59.658
That's not Novocain.

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:03.662
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.

01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:07.332
Nitrous? I didn't know you guys
still used nitrous.

01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:09.543
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.

01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:12.462
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.

01:10:13.338 --> 01:10:14.965
But they all talk.

01:10:22.181 --> 01:10:25.517
Hey, Frankie! Fancy seeing you here.

01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:29.313
You back on the job yet
or you need me to send more?

01:10:29.354 --> 01:10:31.982
I got a couple Civil War
re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.

01:10:32.024 --> 01:10:34.193
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.

01:10:34.276 --> 01:10:36.528
Job's done. Richard's history.

01:10:36.612 --> 01:10:39.239
- What?
- She dumped him last night.

01:10:39.323 --> 01:10:42.367
- How do you know?
- He told me. The marriage is off.

01:10:42.451 --> 01:10:43.994
So he's out completely?

01:10:44.036 --> 01:10:46.663
Well, he wants to stay friends,
but she's done with him.

01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:48.248
She said she was confused
about her feelings

01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:51.210
and it wasn't right
to string him along, so...

01:10:52.044 --> 01:10:53.545
Why would Richard tell you all this?

01:10:53.587 --> 01:10:56.507
Because I gave him
700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.

01:10:56.548 --> 01:10:59.843
- Is that a lot?
- No. It's not fatal till 750.

01:10:59.885 --> 01:11:02.387
You know, I think this sounds
a lot like a premarital spat.

01:11:02.471 --> 01:11:04.473
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No. Definitely not.

01:11:04.556 --> 01:11:05.766
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.

01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:08.519
To get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.

01:11:08.602 --> 01:11:10.437
She's going there for six months.

01:11:10.521 --> 01:11:15.067
It's the real thing. She leaves Thursday,
right after the exhibition opens.

01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:18.862
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.

01:11:18.904 --> 01:11:22.616
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate,
I guess.

01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:25.202
- I can't.
- Me, neither.

01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:27.412
- Well, wait! What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

01:11:27.496 --> 01:11:28.705
Is that from a jewelry store?

01:11:28.747 --> 01:11:31.333
- Oh, my gosh. Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.

01:11:31.416 --> 01:11:33.961
Well, whatever happened
to the "I will not interfere" thing?

01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:35.924
There's nothing to interfere with now,
is there?

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:38.549
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:39.800
And you think she's gonna love you?

01:11:39.883 --> 01:11:42.594
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:11:42.678 --> 01:11:45.347
You said that if I broke up the marriage,
you'd leave me alone!

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.807
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.767
Well, you should at least let me
help you pick out something!

01:11:48.851 --> 01:11:51.186
Do you have any idea how much
"Please forgive me" jewelry

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:52.729
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:54.106
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,

01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:56.275
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank! Listen!

01:11:56.358 --> 01:11:59.319
Our time together, as we both know,
has been rather unpleasant.

01:11:59.403 --> 01:12:02.072
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man,

01:12:02.114 --> 01:12:06.493
boorish, distasteful, uncouth,
uneducated, stupid, at least...

01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:13.125
- You gonna finish?
- Done.

01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:17.045
- Okay.
- The point is this,

01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:19.840
we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?

01:12:19.923 --> 01:12:22.634
One day, not too soon I hope,
we meet up again.

01:12:22.718 --> 01:12:26.221
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...

01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:31.477
But why am I still here?

01:12:36.815 --> 01:12:39.151
Construction crane dropped
two tons of steel on us.

01:12:39.193 --> 01:12:40.319
That must have hurt.

01:12:40.402 --> 01:12:42.738
It was a hydraulic leak. An act of God!

01:12:42.821 --> 01:12:44.573
Why does he do those things?

01:12:44.656 --> 01:12:46.825
But the crane operator,
he thinks it's all his fault.

01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:48.535
Oh, therapy time!

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.172
Don't panic. It's nothing.

01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:06.261
A key chain.

01:13:07.137 --> 01:13:08.972
I needed a key chain!

01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:11.600
- I love it!
- Oh, good.

01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:16.355
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...

01:13:16.438 --> 01:13:19.441
What a strange
and practical man you are.

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:22.694
It was down to that
or a set of socket wrenches.

01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:25.155
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.

01:13:25.197 --> 01:13:27.324
$140. The receipt's in the box.

01:13:27.366 --> 01:13:30.369
No, well, you don't actually
have to tell people in that situation.

01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:32.913
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.

01:13:32.996 --> 01:13:35.207
It's not like
it's Peruvian gold or anything.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:38.836
And the reason I say that
is because there was a set of earrings

01:13:38.919 --> 01:13:41.004
made from Peruvian gold in the shop,

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:42.566
and I thought, "Gwen would like those,

01:13:42.589 --> 01:13:44.469
"but sorry,
a little bit out of my price range."

01:13:44.508 --> 01:13:45.634
So...

01:13:46.718 --> 01:13:49.221
What? Stop giving me the pirate look.

01:13:49.263 --> 01:13:54.601
I just got you a gift and, you know,
nothing ostentatious or pushy.

01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:57.062
Just a little gesture to let you know
I've been thinking about you,

01:13:57.146 --> 01:13:58.939
and I think you should accept it

01:13:59.022 --> 01:14:02.985
in the spirit of friendship
with which it was given.

01:14:03.068 --> 01:14:06.405
"Pirate look"? How could you
possibly know about that?

01:14:06.446 --> 01:14:08.282
- I don't.
- You do.

01:14:09.032 --> 01:14:11.410
- Common expression?
- No.

01:14:11.451 --> 01:14:13.203
How do you know
about any of this stuff?

01:14:13.287 --> 01:14:16.290
- Pirate look? Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:18.625
And then the other night,
Frank's favorite drink?

01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:21.211
Come on, take it easy.

01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:23.797
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.

01:14:23.881 --> 01:14:25.632
How do you know what I hate?

01:14:25.716 --> 01:14:27.718
Lucky guess. Can we start again?

01:14:27.801 --> 01:14:30.888
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.

01:14:31.346 --> 01:14:33.056
She's leaving anyway in a few days.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.267
Gonna have to go with the truth,
Dentist, no choice.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.686
You've got about 10 seconds
to start talking, buddy,

01:14:37.769 --> 01:14:39.104
and then I'm out of here.

01:14:39.188 --> 01:14:41.940
How do you know
this stuff from my life with Frank?

01:14:42.024 --> 01:14:43.567
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:44.860
Try me.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.031
A couple of weeks ago, I went into
hospital for a routine operation,

01:14:49.114 --> 01:14:53.577
but there was complications.
And I died. Just for a few minutes...

01:14:56.246 --> 01:14:58.790
It's true! I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.

01:14:58.874 --> 01:15:01.835
You know what? Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.

01:15:01.919 --> 01:15:03.253
How else would I know
all the things I know?

01:15:03.295 --> 01:15:05.464
Well, you must have known Frank.

01:15:05.547 --> 01:15:07.466
I don't know,
maybe you were his dentist.

01:15:07.508 --> 01:15:10.228
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.

01:15:10.302 --> 01:15:12.554
- How do you get like you?
- Please.

01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:16.517
One question, and if I get it wrong,
you'll never see me again.

01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:22.105
Frank used to have this nightmare
over and over.

01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:25.609
He'd wake up in tears and he never told
anybody else about it, but me.

01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:27.110
What was it?

01:15:27.903 --> 01:15:29.196
Drowning.

01:15:30.072 --> 01:15:33.450
I'd dream that I dove into the water,
and I went down deep,

01:15:33.492 --> 01:15:36.119
but when I turned around
to make it back to the top,

01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:37.746
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:39.414
Drowning. He dived into the water,

01:15:39.498 --> 01:15:44.211
and it didn't matter how hard he tried
to get back to the surface, he couldn't.

01:15:45.462 --> 01:15:47.339
That's right, isn't it?

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.466
Not even close.

01:15:52.136 --> 01:15:53.137
No!

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:56.557
You know the first time I met you?

01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.979
And then the next 10 or 12 times
after that, I thought, "What a jerk."

01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:04.731
But then I got to know you
a little bit, right?

01:16:04.815 --> 01:16:07.693
And I convinced myself
that I saw something human in you.

01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:09.736
You know,
"Maybe he's just a little eccentric,

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.072
"needs a little work."

01:16:12.156 --> 01:16:15.492
But to use intimate details
about my dead husband

01:16:15.534 --> 01:16:19.163
in order to get close to me,
or for God knows what other reason,

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:21.206
that's unforgivable.

01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:23.625
You're sick.

01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:28.881
- I love you.
- Don't call me!

01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:37.723
You lied. Why would you do that?

01:16:42.186 --> 01:16:44.563
Because you're
a heartless son of a bitch

01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:48.066
who doesn't give a rat's ass
about anyone but himself.

01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:53.739
She's already had one of those.

01:16:55.324 --> 01:16:57.284
See you around, Dentist.

01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:40.911
- What?
- It's my daughter.

01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:42.553
Yeah, you mentioned
something about that.

01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:45.165
She won't speak to her sister,
her only sister.

01:17:45.249 --> 01:17:47.960
She's so angry about the necklace I left,

01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:51.255
but I slipped a letter under her door
the day before I died.

01:17:51.296 --> 01:17:53.590
It explained everything.

01:17:53.632 --> 01:17:56.426
But there was carpeting in the entryway.

01:17:56.468 --> 01:17:59.972
I didn't know
the letter went under the carpet.

01:18:00.055 --> 01:18:01.265
She never got it.

01:18:01.348 --> 01:18:03.809
My God, you're boring, aren't you?

01:18:06.478 --> 01:18:09.439
My little boy has a stuffed animal,
a squirrel.

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:11.275
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.

01:18:11.316 --> 01:18:15.237
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.072
They don't know it's just
under the front seat of the car.

01:18:17.156 --> 01:18:18.991
It's right there, they just can't see it.

01:18:19.074 --> 01:18:21.952
So now, he cries himself to sleep
without it every night,

01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:24.496
because to him that toy is me.

01:18:25.164 --> 01:18:26.832
I can't help you.

01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:30.085
You mean you won't help us.

01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:31.962
Isn't that the truth?

01:18:32.004 --> 01:18:35.132
Yeah, I'll tell you
what else is true, shall I?

01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:39.303
We live alone and then we die alone.

01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:42.806
And, apparently, we stay alone.

01:18:44.183 --> 01:18:46.643
That's the truth, too, isn't it?

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.749
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!

01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:04.388
<b>Unbelievable! Come on.</b>

01:21:04.698 --> 01:21:06.700
- Hello.
- What a day.

01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:11.163
Yeah, well, it appears that
winter is upon us.

01:21:11.246 --> 01:21:13.081
- Hail.
- What?

01:21:13.165 --> 01:21:15.959
It doesn't even have
the decency to snow.

01:21:17.002 --> 01:21:20.589
Is there any more stupid form
of precipitation than hail?

01:21:22.257 --> 01:21:26.595
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?

01:21:26.678 --> 01:21:28.555
- Yeah.
- We're friends.

01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:29.723
- Well...
- Associates.

01:21:29.807 --> 01:21:32.226
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:34.394
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...

01:21:34.478 --> 01:21:36.688
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.

01:21:36.772 --> 01:21:37.815
- Yeah.
- We're close.

01:21:37.856 --> 01:21:40.692
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but... What the...

01:21:40.776 --> 01:21:43.320
Well, that's not the point, is it?

01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:45.906
Listen.

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:48.534
I met a woman.

01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:52.037
The kind of a woman that

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.207
makes you want to go back in time
to before you met her.

01:21:55.290 --> 01:22:00.128
Whatever the hell life was like then,
it's not as bad as the hell now.

01:22:01.922 --> 01:22:05.008
Knowing she's out there
and you can't have her.

01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:08.679
What I'm trying to say is

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:13.100
could you write me
a prescription for Percocet?

01:22:14.309 --> 01:22:15.811
What?

01:22:15.894 --> 01:22:17.414
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?

01:22:17.437 --> 01:22:21.900
Legally. It's for my sleep
and to pretend she never happened.

01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:24.153
Or Darvon.

01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:25.654
Or Vicodin.

01:22:25.737 --> 01:22:28.866
Just like a 30 count, or 60,
if you don't want

01:22:29.908 --> 01:22:33.036
me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.

01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:35.831
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.

01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:41.086
Come with me.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:47.217
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.

01:22:47.259 --> 01:22:48.510
- No.
- Sit down.

01:22:48.594 --> 01:22:50.387
- Why?
- Just sit down.

01:22:57.102 --> 01:23:00.439
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important. Look.

01:23:05.444 --> 01:23:07.571
- Brilliant.
- The other one.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:15.120
Yep. As mass-produced poster
slogans go, that's good.

01:23:15.162 --> 01:23:18.332
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life,
you're gonna have to stop,

01:23:18.415 --> 01:23:21.084
and ask yourself the ultimate question.

01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:23.795
"This business of

01:23:24.963 --> 01:23:28.175
"being such a fucking prick,

01:23:29.593 --> 01:23:31.762
"what is it really getting me?"

01:24:05.546 --> 01:24:08.006
You said something about a letter.

01:25:21.663 --> 01:25:23.457
You should try it on.

01:25:40.766 --> 01:25:43.310
Mom! Look what I found!

01:25:43.393 --> 01:25:46.605
What? Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?

01:25:46.688 --> 01:25:48.816
It fell out of his backpack.

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:51.068
Thank you.

01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:55.197
Dr. Pincus?

01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:02.412
Hi. Sorry, I didn't...

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.418
Thank you. Thank you so much!

01:26:09.127 --> 01:26:10.796
I never realized.

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:39.259
Thanks.

01:27:42.137 --> 01:27:45.098
Many insights into the life
and death of King Pepi.

01:27:45.182 --> 01:27:47.434
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:27:52.022 --> 01:27:54.566
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:55.734
Gwen!

01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:00.197
What are you doing here?

01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:02.199
I've got to talk to
you. I've figured it out.

01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:03.826
Please leave me alone.

01:28:03.909 --> 01:28:05.786
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,

01:28:05.869 --> 01:28:07.496
I think they've got it completely wrong.

01:28:07.579 --> 01:28:11.333
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?

01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:15.254
Look at Pepi. Okay, they buried him with
everything a dead guy doesn't need.

01:28:15.295 --> 01:28:17.589
Household pets, money.

01:28:17.673 --> 01:28:21.301
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?

01:28:21.385 --> 01:28:25.180
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.

01:28:26.098 --> 01:28:28.684
No, not why did they put it in a big...

01:28:28.767 --> 01:28:31.061
Why'd they put it in a jar at all? Why?

01:28:31.103 --> 01:28:32.187
What?

01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:36.692
Why would they go to all that trouble for
someone they'll never see again?

01:28:36.775 --> 01:28:38.152
Because they love him

01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:40.612
and they want to make sure
he'll be okay.

01:28:40.654 --> 01:28:42.197
Because if they know he's okay...

01:28:42.281 --> 01:28:43.657
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:46.451
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.

01:28:46.535 --> 01:28:48.954
Exactly. They can let him go.

01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:52.374
Frank's haunting you, Gwen. Let him go.

01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:54.835
If he's haunting me,
then shouldn't he let me go?

01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:57.337
No. He can't. It's not him. It's you.

01:28:57.421 --> 01:29:01.467
All this stuff about ghosts
having unfinished business,

01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:04.136
it's us that are unfinished.

01:29:04.219 --> 01:29:05.679
Let Frank go.

01:29:06.346 --> 01:29:08.932
Let the pervert decay in peace.

01:29:10.476 --> 01:29:12.728
Please, stop following me.

01:29:17.691 --> 01:29:20.736
- It was wonderful! Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.

01:29:20.819 --> 01:29:21.904
That came out all wrong.

01:29:21.987 --> 01:29:24.323
I don't care how you knew
all that stuff about Frank, okay?

01:29:24.406 --> 01:29:25.616
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...

01:29:25.657 --> 01:29:26.950
Maybe you guys were
a couple of buddies.

01:29:26.992 --> 01:29:28.118
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.411
Two regular guys while he was alive,

01:29:29.495 --> 01:29:32.164
and you went out drinking
and went to strip clubs

01:29:32.247 --> 01:29:33.540
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.

01:29:33.624 --> 01:29:34.744
And laughed at your wives...

01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:37.878
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?

01:29:37.961 --> 01:29:39.630
Why didn't he love me?

01:29:39.671 --> 01:29:41.673
I did love you. I still do.

01:29:41.715 --> 01:29:43.300
He did love you.

01:29:45.511 --> 01:29:47.554
Then why wasn't I enough?

01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:55.354
You've got nothing to say to that,
have you?

01:29:55.437 --> 01:29:56.980
- What?
- Useless.

01:29:57.064 --> 01:29:59.233
Please. What do you think
I'm gonna do, change?

01:29:59.316 --> 01:30:00.484
- Well...
- In all your life,

01:30:00.526 --> 01:30:03.153
have you ever actually known anybody
who's changed at all, ever?

01:30:03.195 --> 01:30:05.322
Why can't you make an effort,
just for a few seconds?

01:30:05.364 --> 01:30:06.406
I am who I am.

01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:07.825
I suppose you're talking
to him right now?

01:30:07.866 --> 01:30:10.035
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?

01:30:10.118 --> 01:30:13.038
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!

01:30:13.705 --> 01:30:15.415
I want to know
why I wasn't enough for him.

01:30:15.499 --> 01:30:20.170
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.

01:30:20.212 --> 01:30:22.631
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.

01:30:22.714 --> 01:30:25.217
And he doesn't know
why he did the things he did.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.719
And you don't get any smarter
just because you're dead.

01:30:27.803 --> 01:30:30.347
You don't get smarter after you die.

01:30:30.389 --> 01:30:33.934
But I did see one thing,
how much I hurt you.

01:30:34.017 --> 01:30:37.563
But he's seen
how much he hurt you. And...

01:30:42.651 --> 01:30:44.403
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:30:46.905 --> 01:30:49.908
- What? What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.

01:30:52.077 --> 01:30:53.412
That's it?

01:30:54.496 --> 01:30:55.873
He's sorry?

01:30:55.914 --> 01:30:58.208
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...

01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:00.586
He's sorry. He's sorry.

01:31:01.378 --> 01:31:04.756
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Heartfelt.

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:07.634
Good guess. I got to go pack.

01:31:07.718 --> 01:31:10.220
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!

01:31:11.263 --> 01:31:12.764
Gwen! Wait!

01:31:13.474 --> 01:31:14.766
Why should I talk to you?

01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:17.060
You couldn't even get his dream right!

01:31:17.144 --> 01:31:19.229
No, because he told me the wrong
dream to try to make me look bad.

01:31:19.313 --> 01:31:20.731
He stitched me up.

01:31:20.772 --> 01:31:22.900
Then what's the right one?

01:31:22.941 --> 01:31:23.942
Well, he's not here right now, is he?

01:31:24.026 --> 01:31:25.444
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.

01:31:25.486 --> 01:31:27.321
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.

01:31:27.404 --> 01:31:29.406
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?

01:31:29.448 --> 01:31:32.826
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.

01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:34.286
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.

01:31:34.328 --> 01:31:36.788
Gwen, I've lived more
in the last few days

01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:42.169
that I've spent with you, since I died,
than I ever lived before I died,

01:31:42.252 --> 01:31:46.006
back when I was living, the first time.
Right? Do you know what I mean?

01:31:46.089 --> 01:31:47.174
Nope.

01:31:47.257 --> 01:31:49.551
Right. I'm born and then...

01:31:57.643 --> 01:31:59.686
Someone call an ambulance!

01:32:00.646 --> 01:32:02.356
Try to get help!

01:32:04.399 --> 01:32:06.401
Somebody do something!

01:32:06.485 --> 01:32:07.903
Oh, my God.

01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:11.490
Now that is a real shame.

01:32:11.573 --> 01:32:13.453
You were really getting
somewhere with her, too.

01:32:13.492 --> 01:32:15.786
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.

01:32:15.828 --> 01:32:17.371
Goddamned MTA strikes again.

01:32:17.454 --> 01:32:19.456
These drivers, I mean,
it's a menace, right?

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.250
No! No, I'm not dead!

01:32:21.333 --> 01:32:23.126
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

01:32:25.838 --> 01:32:27.631
I'm sorry, kiddo.

01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:31.468
Come here, you. Kind of nice.

01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:33.679
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!

01:32:33.762 --> 01:32:36.765
Everything else, every minute up till now
has just been a waste of time!

01:32:36.849 --> 01:32:38.142
Just a warm-up!

01:32:38.225 --> 01:32:39.434
Yeah.

01:32:41.353 --> 01:32:44.189
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...

01:32:44.273 --> 01:32:46.233
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!

01:32:46.316 --> 01:32:50.863
Knowing she needs somebody to
comfort her and knowing it can't be you.

01:32:50.946 --> 01:32:52.865
Has anyone called 911?

01:32:52.906 --> 01:32:55.325
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.

01:32:55.367 --> 01:32:56.493
Well, call them!

01:32:56.535 --> 01:32:59.997
- Wait a minute.
- Space! Give me space!

01:33:02.374 --> 01:33:05.377
He's doing CPR. He knows CPR.
Of course! He knows CPR.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.880
Give him space, he needs space.

01:33:07.963 --> 01:33:09.298
He's probably gonna
cut open your chest

01:33:09.381 --> 01:33:11.049
and massage your heart back
to life with his bare hands.

01:33:11.133 --> 01:33:14.261
Oh, Lord! Spare this man!

01:33:14.344 --> 01:33:15.721
Okay, I really can't take
this guy anymore.

01:33:15.804 --> 01:33:18.432
Honestly, really, I can't.

01:33:18.515 --> 01:33:19.725
Come on!

01:33:39.411 --> 01:33:42.623
Hey, Pincus, there's something
I should tell you.

01:33:42.706 --> 01:33:45.209
It might come in handy
if you make it back.

01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:48.045
You're gonna help me? Why?

01:33:48.837 --> 01:33:50.839
Those tears she's crying,

01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:56.428
those are for you, now.

01:34:01.683 --> 01:34:03.060
Listen up.

01:34:06.396 --> 01:34:08.273
I think my ride's here.

01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:36.093
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.

01:34:36.718 --> 01:34:38.428
What happened?

01:34:38.512 --> 01:34:40.556
You crossed the street when it said,
"Don't walk."

01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:43.058
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.

01:34:44.309 --> 01:34:45.394
Gwen.

01:34:46.228 --> 01:34:47.521
Was there a woman here?

01:34:47.604 --> 01:34:50.607
It's possible, but if she was unable
to provide proof of kinship,

01:34:50.649 --> 01:34:53.944
security would have escorted her
off the premises.

01:34:53.986 --> 01:34:55.612
Nice work, guys.

01:35:00.159 --> 01:35:02.870
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.

01:35:04.329 --> 01:35:06.832
Looks good. Makes your eyes pop.

01:35:14.423 --> 01:35:15.966
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.

01:35:16.049 --> 01:35:19.011
Remember, only floss
the ones you wanna keep.

01:35:20.637 --> 01:35:21.889
Hi.

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.152
I didn't know you were back.

01:35:35.235 --> 01:35:37.279
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:35:37.362 --> 01:35:39.490
I thought you were in Egypt.

01:35:39.907 --> 01:35:43.160
I felt like sticking around. You're okay?

01:35:43.785 --> 01:35:46.079
Yeah. Under the circumstances.

01:35:46.997 --> 01:35:49.791
You know, I tried visiting you
at the hospital, but they wouldn't...

01:35:49.875 --> 01:35:51.752
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there

01:35:51.835 --> 01:35:54.755
at Cooperative Institutional
Health Bastards.

01:35:56.256 --> 01:35:57.841
You okay?

01:35:57.925 --> 01:35:59.968
I have bad molar contact.

01:36:01.303 --> 01:36:03.514
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.

01:36:03.555 --> 01:36:06.141
I'm not. I actually made
the appointment with Dr. Prashar.

01:36:06.225 --> 01:36:09.353
- Oh, no, of course. No... He's...
- Well, I didn't know...

01:36:11.063 --> 01:36:12.815
He's a lovely man.

01:36:12.898 --> 01:36:16.860
And he's a better dentist than me,
but don't tell him I said so.

01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:22.241
Anyway, I'm glad to see
you're looking well.

01:36:23.742 --> 01:36:25.160
And you.

01:36:28.163 --> 01:36:30.541
He's eight years old.

01:36:30.582 --> 01:36:32.960
- Sorry? What?
- Frank.

01:36:33.043 --> 01:36:35.254
In his dream. The real one.

01:36:35.337 --> 01:36:38.006
And he's walking in the woods
with his dad.

01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:40.759
He's holding hands,
but then suddenly, his dad's not there.

01:36:40.843 --> 01:36:44.429
He tries to find his way back
the way he came,

01:36:44.513 --> 01:36:47.724
but he keeps ending up
back where he started,

01:36:47.808 --> 01:36:49.726
and that's his nightmare.

01:36:50.102 --> 01:36:53.480
That he's lost
and he can't find his way home.

01:36:53.564 --> 01:36:54.982
That's it.

01:36:56.483 --> 01:36:58.277
Do you still see him?

01:36:59.153 --> 01:37:01.029
He found his way home.

01:37:01.905 --> 01:37:03.282
That's good.

01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:38.108
It hurts when I smile.

01:37:41.945 --> 01:37:43.322
I can fix that for you.
