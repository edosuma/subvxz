00:08.920 --> 00:10.570
Thing is, no one exactly knows

00:10.640 --> 00:13.564
what happened
to the Crying Man that summer.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.569
Some say that he drowned in the lake.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.880
But others say that
they've seen his ghost

00:20.960 --> 00:24.248
wandering these woods
in search for his lost sister.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.245
Actually, they say if you're quiet
and listen real hard,

00:29.640 --> 00:31.290
you can still hear him crying.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.607
Mr. Cross, that was, like,
the worst Crying Man ever.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.001
- Really? I thought it was pretty good.
-No.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.445
You guys think we're kidding.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.568
Just remember to stick close
to the campfire tonight, okay?

00:46.640 --> 00:48.722
Hey, guys, do you hear that?

00:49.640 --> 00:50.641
Hear what?

00:51.080 --> 00:52.320
That humming sound.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.202
Stay here. I'm gonna take a look
around the campground.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.961
What humming?

00:59.040 --> 01:00.610
Where's Mr. Cross going?

01:01.800 --> 01:04.690
He's just trying to scare us.
 So lame.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.242
Come on, guys, grab a s'more.
All right, these are for you.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.890
Ooh, I want the marshmallows.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.610
Tom, I know you like chocolate,
so there you go.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.762
- Don't hog the marshmallows, okay?
- Of course, my favorite.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.841
Hey-

01:20.360 --> 01:22.249
- Everyone, to the truck! Now!
-No!

01:22.320 --> 01:25.324
Go, go! Go! Come on. Hurry up.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.050
What was that?

01:43.640 --> 01:45.324
Are you guys Okay?

01:47.160 --> 01:48.525
Mr. Cross?

01:50.920 --> 01:52.365
Mr. Cross?

01:55.200 --> 01:57.851
Come on, guys. Let's go look for him.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.082
Stay close.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.811
Mr. Cross, are you okay?

02:08.880 --> 02:10.120
Where is he?

02:10.199 --> 02:11.929
Mr. Cross.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.365
We should just go back.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.125
Ahh!

02:40.400 --> 02:42.164
Working up a good sweat there, sir?

02:42.240 --> 02:45.403
I don't sweat. I glisten.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.131
Blood pressure, heart rate,
biochems, all normal.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.282
All that's left is the blood sample.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.763
You should know,
I'm not a fan of getting poked.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.046
Tell me, sir, have you been feeling
under the weather lately?

02:59.120 --> 03:00.281
- Why?

03:00.360 --> 03:03.011
I just noticed from your chart that
you're not due for a general physical

03:03.120 --> 03:04.531
for another three months.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.809
I made a mistake.
Took a call from my physical therapist.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.611
Asked how I was feeling,
I said, "A little rusty."

03:10.680 --> 03:12.569
Next thing you know,
I'm wired to this hamster wheel.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.007
Well, you can officially
tell your physical therapist

03:15.080 --> 03:17.162
that you're fit as the proverbial fiddle.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.651
Especially for a man of your age.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.728
"A man of my age"?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.689
That's something
you say to an old person.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.970
Is it?  Well, let's get you
some electrolytes, shall we?

03:30.040 --> 03:31.246
Huh.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.723
Sorry, Fitz.
It's close, but it's just not right.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.409
Really? 'Cause Agent Coulson
had no problems.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.811
It's an ounce too heavy.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.048
An ounce? Seriously?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.811
It's the difference
between success and failure.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.201
When you're on a rooftop
with a 15 mile-an-hour wind,

03:51.280 --> 03:52.805
your target is 500 yards away...

03:52.920 --> 03:55.002
Yeah, but we do have a rifle.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.401
Lose the ounce.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.642
Yeah, okay. On it.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.163
Lose the ounce.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.810
"I'm Agent Grant Ward,

04:04.440 --> 04:08.081
"and I can shoot the legs off a flea
from 500 yards,

04:08.160 --> 04:09.685
- "as long as it's not windy."

04:15.760 --> 04:17.887
Hey, that's a sound
I haven't heard in a bit.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.166
Yeah, well, you wouldn't be
laughing a whole lot

04:21.279 --> 04:23.726
if you were living in Ward's doghouse.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.724
You made the rounds,
apologized to us all.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.121
- What more can he ask? Mmm.
-I don't know.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.611
I have been busting my ass,

04:30.680 --> 04:33.251
memorizing every S.H.I.E.L.D.
protocol manual,

04:33.320 --> 04:36.369
following every order.
"Yes, sir!" "No, sir!"

04:36.440 --> 04:40.286
I even let them tag me like a stray dog.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.523
I mean, I know I lied to you guys,

04:43.600 --> 04:46.206
but I was trying to protect my boyfriend.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.884
You know, we all make mistakes.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.361
I don't care...
Who cares about your ex-boyfriend?

04:52.440 --> 04:54.647
It's not like
I'm comparing Ward to Miles,

04:54.720 --> 04:57.200
but at least with Miles,
I didn't have to worry

04:57.280 --> 05:00.329
about passive aggressive stuff.
There's no mind games.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.289
We spoke the same language,
you know?

05:02.360 --> 05:03.600
Yeah, yeah, a bit like we do.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.570
Totally. You and Simmons are so tight.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.326
- It's like you're psychically linked.
-No. Actually, no, I don't think so.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.722
So Ward was here? Let me guess.
The Night-Night pistol again?

05:13.800 --> 05:16.201
Yeah. Oh, yeah, and he said
it was off by an ounce.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.408
'Course he did.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.166
"I'm Agent Grant Ward,

05:22.240 --> 05:26.404
"and I could rupture your spleen
with my left pinky.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.525
- "Blindfolded."

05:29.280 --> 05:30.850
- That is dead on.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.844
Hey. Hustle up and grab your gear.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.604
- We're on a mission.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.566
Something funny?

05:40.960 --> 05:42.485
Poor, silly Fitz.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.844
He mistakenly left a dummy round
in the pistol.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.490
Should be proper now.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.411
Great. Thanks.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.366
Troop leader's name
was Adam Cross.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.363
Apparently, he said he heard
something in the woods,

06:07.440 --> 06:08.407
went to check it out.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.403
That's where
the electrostatic anomaly occurred.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.686
What I don't understand is

06:11.760 --> 06:13.364
usually they're caused
by a massive electrical storm.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.727
But there wasn't a storm
within 1,000 miles of here last night.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.370
This anomaly's different.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.801
It has a side effect
we've never seen before.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.807
The battery blew straight up
through the hood.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.325
Landed over here.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.330
Hell of a force
to create that kind of trajectory.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.841
Huh.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.930
What are you doing?

06:37.040 --> 06:39.168
I'm shadowing my supervising officer.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.722
Shadowing. Not smothering.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.201
There's scorch marks all over that tree.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.123
Lucky the whole forest
didn't burn down.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.931
I don't get it. Seems to me
like this electroshock thingy

06:50.000 --> 06:51.570
was some freak lightning strike.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.331
I mean, why call us? What's the big...

06:54.400 --> 06:55.606
Oh

06:56.120 --> 06:58.248
Never mind.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.767
So sad a man died this way.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.968
And yet, so amazing.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.123
Fitz-Simmons, any idea
what could cause an effect like this?

07:08.800 --> 07:11.610
- Well, judging by the horizontal...
-The soliton hypothesis...

07:11.680 --> 07:14.604
Time. Let's try that again.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.609
Any idea what could cause
an effect like this?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.762
- The hell if I know.
-Uh, no, no clue.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.923
Seems to me like we're either dealing
with some freak natural event

07:22.000 --> 07:23.490
or a new high-tech weapon.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.610
Or could it be someone
from your Ã¼ber secret Index?

07:27.680 --> 07:30.001
There's no one on the Index
with this type of power.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.570
That we know of.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.967
I'll contact Agent Blake
at S.H.I.E.L.D. H.Q.,

07:34.040 --> 07:35.121
have him check it out.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.964
Whoever or whatever's responsible,

07:37.040 --> 07:38.451
we can't let this happen again.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.369
Fitz, see his forehead?

07:40.480 --> 07:42.164
Look at that endothelial discoloration.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.050
Yeah, same dispersal pattern
as the strike on the truck.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.248
Could be an entry wound,
cauterized immediately?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.525
- Freaky.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.406
Freaky!

07:58.560 --> 08:01.530
- You found something on Cross?
-Many things, actually.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.170
But you already knew that,

08:03.240 --> 08:05.720
thanks to my fancy S.H.I.E.L.D.
house-arrest gizmo

08:05.800 --> 08:09.009
tracking my every key swipe,
my online activity, my cholesterol.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.969
Just wish it came in another color.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.846
Or came off.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.001
The victim?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.844
Adam Cross. Single, no kids,

08:15.920 --> 08:18.685
originally from Wrigley, Pennsylvania,
not far from here.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.841
Been there.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.605
They have a nice little
strawberry festival in the spring.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.806
Occupation?

08:23.880 --> 08:25.530
Phys. Ed. teacher
at the local high school,

08:25.600 --> 08:27.682
and varsity baseball coach,
and troop leader,

08:27.760 --> 08:29.046
and volunteer firefighter.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.249
This guy makes Captain America
look like The Dude.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.808
The Big Lebowski. Seriously?

08:37.880 --> 08:40.167
What about a criminal record,
restraining order,

08:40.240 --> 08:41.809
something that might give us
a suspect?

08:41.880 --> 08:44.042
--Nada. Not even a parking ticket.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.964
I skimmed all his posts,
anyone linked to his pages,

08:47.040 --> 08:49.361
hoping for a crazy ex
or super-powered stalker,

08:49.440 --> 08:50.407
and he's clean.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.403
Everybody looks clean
on their first go 'round.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.881
Ward's right. We're missing something.
Dig deeper.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.964
You've been pretty tough on her.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.690
She lied to us.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.888
Contacted the Rising Tide
while we were on a mission.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.769
If she wants our trust back,
she's got to earn it.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.411
The background she ran on Cross
is a good start.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.891
Put it up on the server.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.248
I want May to have a look
when she's done with her interrogation.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.084
Have a cookie.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.010
Excellent timing, sir.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.208
I've been analyzing sagittal
and coronal images

09:37.280 --> 09:39.169
of the victim's brain.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.809
What's Fitz doing out there?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.769
He detected a strange energy
coming off the body.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.730
- He's afraid of it, isn't he?
-it's the smell!

09:46.800 --> 09:48.325
There's no shame in it, Fitz.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.283
It's perfectly natural to be afraid.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.562
No, the only thing I'm afraid of

09:52.640 --> 09:56.611
is putrid, decaying flesh
corrupting my pristine workspace.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.648
Do you remember the last time
you brought a dead thing into the lab?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.165
Oh, not the stupid cat again!

10:00.240 --> 10:02.641
- And it's our lab, Fitz, not your lab!
-The cat! Tell him about the cat.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.563
You left his liver next to my lunch!

10:04.640 --> 10:07.041
Guys, can we please...

10:07.120 --> 10:08.281
Yes, sir.

10:08.360 --> 10:12.285
Um, as I was saying,
this is the victim's brain.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.442
Looks like
a burnt baked potato.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.931
That happens when it's hit

10:16.000 --> 10:18.970
with close to 2,000 megajoules
of electrostatic energy.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.407
That's almost double the power
of a lightning bolt.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.246
Kid's clean.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.770
You figure out
why the body was floating?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.644
--Not yet.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.200
The molecular density of the victim
was temporarily altered

10:31.280 --> 10:33.123
by an unknown energy source.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.770
I'm hoping to shed some light
on its effects

10:34.840 --> 10:36.763
once I extract a brain tissue sample.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.887
It's happening again!

10:37.960 --> 10:39.928
It's science, Fitz!
I have to dissect something!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.844
No, the satellite's picking up
another electrostatic event,

10:42.920 --> 10:44.809
not 20 kilometers from here!

10:48.480 --> 10:49.811
Fitz, what's the latest reading?

10:49.880 --> 10:52.963
We're at 324 megajoules
and growing stronger.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.610
Dangerous territory, sir.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.411
There's a farmhouse a mile north of you
right at the center of the signal.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.481
That's gotta be it.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.040
Skye, dig up everything you can
on whoever lives at that farm.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.929
We need to know
who we're dealing with.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.971
Hold on now. What just happened?
Um, it's gone.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.202
- What's gone?
-The electrostatic signal.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.123
It seemed to pulse, then disappear.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.804
We need a shortcut.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.131
Door's barred from the inside.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.280
- Hayloft's open.
-We could ram it with the truck.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.161
Or...

11:58.640 --> 11:59.926
Scan the perimeter.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.968
Whoever did this
couldn't have gotten far.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.091
Barricaded himself inside.
Went for his shotgun.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.606
He was scared.
Trying to protect himself.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.365
From who? How'd they get to him?

12:19.440 --> 12:22.091
Another burn mark on the forehead.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.529
No sign of anyone.
No tracks, no vehicles down the road.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.406
Skye, we need real-time
sat surveillance on this area right now.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.601
- Hang on.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.842
I think I found something
you might wanna see first.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.446
Sending it over now.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.447
The guy who owns the farm's
name is Frank Whalen.

12:40.520 --> 12:41.726
He's a volunteer firefighter

12:41.800 --> 12:44.849
at the same station house
as our first victim, Adam Cross.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.285
Our two victims knew each other?

12:46.360 --> 12:48.522
They were both responders
when the aliens crashed New York.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.921
Two victims from the same firehouse
found in the same weird way.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.768
We're looking for a killer.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.761
Gotcha!

13:27.840 --> 13:30.810
Hey, urn, anyone else notice all
the metal scattered around the body,

13:30.880 --> 13:32.769
like an electromagnetic field
was present?

13:32.840 --> 13:34.330
Question is, what created it?

13:34.400 --> 13:37.051
We need to get this body back
to the lab as soon as possible.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.009
Something about these wounds...

13:39.080 --> 13:40.730
Skye, what'd you find out
about the firehouse?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.490
It turns out
they sent an engine to New York

13:42.560 --> 13:45.086
with a dozen volunteers
after the Chitauri invasion,

13:45.160 --> 13:46.810
including Cross and Whalen.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.167
Maybe it has something to do
with why they were targeted?

13:49.240 --> 13:50.480
Or how they were killed.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.170
You mean, like, an alien weapon?

13:53.320 --> 13:55.163
Let's just make sure
we get to those firefighters

13:55.240 --> 13:56.890
before anyone else does.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.288
Evening, gentlemen.
Agent Phil Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.089
We were on the ground with you
in New York.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.767
S.H.I.E.L.D. Right.
What's this all about?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.844
We'd like to ask you a few questions,
take a look around.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.966
Hey, guys-

14:24.120 --> 14:25.201
What's goin' on?

14:26.600 --> 14:29.080
- What are you looking for?
- A scented candle.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.321
Not you.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.768
This wound,
something doesn't quite make sense.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.729
Initially, I thought
these were entry wounds,

14:35.800 --> 14:37.848
as if from a gunshot, but they're not.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.564
They're exit wounds.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.961
What do you mean? Frankie's dead?

14:43.040 --> 14:45.088
- I'm very sorry.
-You know how it happened?

14:45.160 --> 14:48.323
The same way your other friend,
Mr. Cross, died the day before.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.686
Which was how, exactly?

14:51.640 --> 14:52.971
I'm sorry. Your name is?

14:53.440 --> 14:55.681
Tony. Tony Diaz.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.170
You okay, Mr. Diaz?

14:59.280 --> 15:00.611
Actually, uh...

15:02.000 --> 15:04.321
I'm actually not feeling so hot.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.925
Cover the back door.
Nobody comes in or out.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.128
What if this weapon
overloaded the brain

15:12.200 --> 15:14.601
past the threshold
of its electrical capacity

15:14.680 --> 15:16.762
causing it to discharge, like an EMP?

15:16.840 --> 15:19.081
You're assuming
we're dealing with an external source.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.208
I'm saying it was
something from inside him.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.286
Something's happening.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.323
The satellite's picking up
another reading.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.244
It's coming from the firehouse.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.449
That humming noise, you hear that?

15:35.320 --> 15:37.049
No, I don't.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.291
Were you in New York
with Mr. Cross and Mr. Whalen

15:40.360 --> 15:41.885
after the Chitauri invasion?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.889
Come on, you don't hear that?

15:44.560 --> 15:46.005
It's driving me nuts.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.890
Mr. Diaz, are you with me?

15:51.880 --> 15:53.166
Whatever you're doing, make it stop.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.924
I'm not doing anything!

15:55.000 --> 15:56.923
- Where's the weapon?
-The what?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.286
Coulson, I found it.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.885
It's a Chitauri helmet.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.249
Fitz-Simmons, are you seeing this?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.211
It's not a weapon,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.002
yet it caused a cranial discharge.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.482
- What are you doing with the helmet?
-What? The alien thing? It's a souvenir!

16:13.560 --> 16:14.641
--Aah!

16:14.720 --> 16:16.609
--Not again.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.650
Answer the question, Mr. Diaz.
What are you doing with the helmet?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.449
The first time anyone's touched it
since New York

16:21.520 --> 16:23.488
-was a couple nights ago.
-Why?

16:23.560 --> 16:25.369
It had rust all over it.
We were cleaning it.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.441
That wasn't rust.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.045
May, don't touch it!

16:28.120 --> 16:30.122
Sir, he's not using a weapon.
He's infected.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.407
I think the helmet was the source
of an alien virus.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.050
All we did was clean it, I swear!

16:36.120 --> 16:39.124
Me, Frankie and Adam,
we were bored on the third shift,

16:39.200 --> 16:40.770
so we decided to clean it.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.409
Adam and Frankie...

16:49.760 --> 16:53.287
Mr. Diaz, I'm putting the gun away now,
okay?

16:54.560 --> 16:56.688
Sir, he's at 600 megajoules
and climbing!

16:56.760 --> 16:57.807
Sir!

16:58.280 --> 17:01.807
Clear everybody out.
Clear everybody out now.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.925
I'm gonna wind up like them, aren't I?

17:18.480 --> 17:20.561
Why don't you have a seat?

17:33.600 --> 17:36.729
You have any family? Wife, kids?

17:38.760 --> 17:42.242
Is there anyone you wanna talk to?
Anything I can do?

17:42.320 --> 17:45.642
Sir, you have to get out of there
right now! He's going...

17:51.480 --> 17:53.005
Listen to me.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.211
I've been where you are right now.

17:57.280 --> 18:01.444
So please believe me when I tell you,
you don't have to be afraid.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.324
What are you talking about?

18:04.400 --> 18:05.765
Your job.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.248
It gets pretty dangerous, doesn't it?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.731
Mine, too.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.685
I got hurt once. Pretty bad.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.364
And I died.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.441
Some say it was only for eight seconds,

18:24.520 --> 18:27.000
but I know it was more than that.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.040
I know I wasn't here anymore.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.722
I was there.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.080
What's it like?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.721
It's beautiful.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.887
You better get going, buddy.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.925
Go.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.931
All clean.
No traces of electrostatic energy.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.529
What about the other firefighters?

20:04.640 --> 20:07.883
They'll be quarantined and observed
at a S.H.I.E.L.D. bio-hazard facility.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.721
Um, anyone else notice they're putting
the infected alien thing on our truck?

20:21.800 --> 20:24.531
- We're flying it to the Sandbox.
-Sandbox?

20:24.600 --> 20:27.729
It's a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility
across the Atlantic.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.167
They specialize in hazardous materials.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.527
--if what you suspect is true,

20:32.600 --> 20:34.329
that this is a virus,

20:34.400 --> 20:36.971
then those firefighters
could be infected,

20:37.040 --> 20:38.644
and they're gonna need a cure.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.161
Find one.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.526
Yes, sir.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.964
What's our ETA?

21:10.080 --> 21:12.651
3:37 West Africa Time.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.690
Gonna be a long four hours
and 26 minutes.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.011
You Okay?

21:20.360 --> 21:21.566
Fine.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.962
Just want this alien thing off our plane
as soon as humanly possible.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.569
You wanna talk about your physical?

21:29.680 --> 21:30.806
Nothing to tell.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.885
My physical therapist requested it.
He's updating his files or something.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.048
You'd tell me if something was wrong.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.129
Of course.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.248
Sir,
I think I've discovered something.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.330
- Could you come down to the lab?
-I'll be right there.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.606
Phil.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.480
The fireman,
you did everything you could for him.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.729
So,
what am I looking for, exactly?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.564
Wait for it.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.681
What was that?

22:04.800 --> 22:06.484
A groundbreaking discovery!

22:06.560 --> 22:08.961
I believe the firefighters
initially contracted the virus

22:09.040 --> 22:10.326
when they cleaned the helmet.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.563
The friction activating
some long-decaying Chitauri organism.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.689
Hang on. These cells are
from the bodies of the firefighters?

22:16.760 --> 22:19.570
Brain cells, yes.
The last vestiges of the infection.

22:19.640 --> 22:23.850
Some viruses sleep inside host cells
for years before reproducing,

22:23.920 --> 22:26.366
as they did inside the helmet,
the initial source.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.363
But what those cells tell us is that

22:28.440 --> 22:31.250
we're dealing with a propagating virus,
which means...

22:31.320 --> 22:33.129
The virus can move
from person to person.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.682
Exactly! And that's
the most exciting part, how it spreads.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.366
Not through the air,
or through direct fluid transfer,

22:39.440 --> 22:41.807
but through electrostatic shock.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.207
It's like nothing
we've ever seen on Earth.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.362
I didn't think it possible a virus could

22:46.440 --> 22:48.920
alter its host's molecular density
and polarity.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.286
That explains the floating.

22:50.360 --> 22:54.081
I can't wait till the virologists at the CDC
and S.H.I.E.L.D. H.Q. see this.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.091
Sir, is something wrong?

22:59.160 --> 23:00.969
I'm so sorry, Jemma.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.126
Oh, no.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.923
Simmons believes
she contracted the virus

23:40.000 --> 23:41.445
approximately 36 hours ago

23:41.520 --> 23:44.569
when she received an electrostatic
shock from the first victim.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.051
How much time does she have?

23:46.120 --> 23:48.088
Based on when
the firemen were infected,

23:48.160 --> 23:50.891
how quickly
their symptoms manifested...

23:51.680 --> 23:52.886
Two hours at most.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.610
That's enough time, right?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.648
I mean, S.H.I.E.L.D. has dozens
of labs and scientists

23:56.720 --> 23:58.290
working on this thing, don't they?

23:58.360 --> 24:00.840
They do. How soon
can you get us on the ground?

24:00.960 --> 24:02.041
Three hours.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.044
Our path to the Sandbox has us
right in the middle of the Atlantic.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.601
So, correct me if I'm wrong,
but if we can't land in time...

24:07.680 --> 24:10.570
Simmons will release a pulse that
will blow this plane right out of the sky.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.530
We can't just sit here and watch her die.
We have to do something.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.650
There's only one person on this plane
capable of finding a solution for this,

24:17.720 --> 24:20.200
and I'm willing to bet my life
that she will.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.450
She's just a kid.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.324
I believe we have a winner.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.882
Fast and efficient,
the perfect delivery mechanism.

24:37.240 --> 24:41.165
Uh, hey, um, not that it was easy
to find a mineralized solution

24:41.240 --> 24:45.086
that could suspend the vaccine
and conduct electricity.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.481
I wish you wouldn't use
the word "vaccine".

24:47.560 --> 24:49.847
It's really more of an anti-serum.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.605
Okay, so...

24:55.360 --> 25:00.321
These antibodies should be able
to target the virus' antigens.

25:01.640 --> 25:05.087
If this bloody alien virus
even has antigens.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.924
- Come on, now. Come on.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.203
That wasn't very cooperative
of him now, was it?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.442
Why aren't you down there?

25:44.800 --> 25:47.007
They don't need an audience.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.564
You can stay.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.491
If you want.

26:03.640 --> 26:04.801
I hate this.

26:06.720 --> 26:09.166
- I just feel so...
-Helpless.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.401
Yeah.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.528
I wanted it to be a person.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.401
Some super-powered psychopath.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.643
Someone I could hurt.
Someone I could punish.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.841
That I could do.

26:28.120 --> 26:32.409
What I can't do is protect you guys
from stuff I can't even see.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.521
Or understand.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.010
So what do we do?

26:45.520 --> 26:46.760
We wait.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.690
And get ready.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.964
Ready for what?

26:54.520 --> 26:57.729
For whatever it is
we're called upon to do.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.601
Coulson, nice to see you're not dead.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.648
Did you get our analysis of the virus?

27:05.720 --> 27:08.041
We did, and S.H.I.E.L.D. has
no record of anything like it.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.121
No one does.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.124
So it's imperative it reach
the Sandbox without incident.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.089
In case of a pandemic,
we're gonna need it.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.207
I'm aware of that,

27:15.320 --> 27:17.971
but I don't need more orders
or ultimatums. I need answers.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.202
I wish I had some for you.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.931
I'm sorry, Coulson.
I've been ordered to inform you

27:23.000 --> 27:26.721
that if you have infected cargo,
you need to dump it.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.810
Do you copy me, Coulson?

27:30.880 --> 27:32.166
--These orders are coming from up top.

27:32.240 --> 27:35.403
I'm sorry, bad connection.
Didn't get that last part.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.686
Don't even think it.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.764
I don't have to. That's your job.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.127
It's all right.
Everything's gonna be fine.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.806
Please stop saying that.
I see you looking at your watch.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.691
Are you sure you don't need
my help just to...

28:05.760 --> 28:07.444
Are you sure this thing even works?

28:07.520 --> 28:08.601
Yeah, well, you know it does.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.444
My device isn't the issue.
It's the vaccine.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.329
Anti-serum!

28:12.400 --> 28:15.085
And all I'm wondering is
whether you calibrated it correctly...

28:15.160 --> 28:17.527
Hey, it's not the device!
Hey, don't put this on me!

28:17.600 --> 28:19.045
I was doing just fine tucked away

28:19.120 --> 28:21.487
in a safe, indoor, non-mobile lab
at the Academy.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.848
Then you had to go and drag us into
this flying circus!

28:25.560 --> 28:28.006
Didn't even pass our field assessments,
for God's sakes.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.930
Oh, please, as if I forced you
to follow me anywhere.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.411
You said, and I quote,

28:32.520 --> 28:36.491
"Oh, Fitz, it's the most perfect
opportunity for us to see the world!

28:36.560 --> 28:38.449
"We'd be fools to pass this one up."

28:38.520 --> 28:40.921
I hate it when you use that voice.
That's not even how I sound.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.889
And you were just afraid
of going into the field.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.961
I was not afraid.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.326
And don't you dare act like
these last months

28:45.400 --> 28:47.289
haven't been the highlight
of your entire pasty life.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.124
Pasty. Oh, really?

28:49.200 --> 28:51.202
Well, when did you become
so sun-kissed?

28:52.320 --> 28:54.721
Because I'm pretty sure
that every minute of every day,

28:54.800 --> 28:56.962
you've been stuck in a lab
right beside me.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.611
At the Academy, at Sci-Ops, this plane,

28:59.680 --> 29:02.604
you've been beside me
the whole damn time!

29:17.000 --> 29:18.843
You have to fix this.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.842
I don't know how, Fitz.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.167
The antibodies
from the three firefighters

29:26.240 --> 29:29.164
aren't strong enough to fight this virus.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.481
It's born from alien DNA.

29:34.840 --> 29:38.731
There's no one to create
an anti-serum from,

29:39.520 --> 29:43.206
because no one's actually
survived this except...

29:45.520 --> 29:47.329
The Chitauri.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.649
The minky bastard who actually wore
the helmet had the virus...

29:53.720 --> 29:54.801
Yeah, and managed to survive

29:54.880 --> 29:56.848
without ever emitting
an electrostatic pulse because...

29:56.920 --> 29:58.490
- He was immune.
-Yes!

29:59.800 --> 30:02.883
She was just the carrier.
Like Typhoid Mary.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.487
Uh, she? Well, no, wait.
You don't really think that...

30:06.560 --> 30:07.971
Okay. Doesn't matter.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.169
Um, so if I can scrape some epithelial
cells from the inside of the helmet,

30:11.240 --> 30:12.321
we can create a vaccine.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.290
Yes! Anti-serum, but yes!

30:19.760 --> 30:21.569
- Isn't that...
- Fitz!

30:26.480 --> 30:29.290
No! Uh...
You can't be in here!

30:29.360 --> 30:31.124
Too late. It's done.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.249
Just try and do your best
to keep your hands off me, yeah?

30:36.040 --> 30:38.168
Fitz, I don't know what
you think you're doing, but...

30:38.240 --> 30:40.322
I'm doing what we always do.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.647
We're gonna fix this. Together.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.925
Third time's a charm.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.491
May I do the honors?

32:03.160 --> 32:05.367
I can't breathe.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.246
We did it.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.086
No.

32:38.320 --> 32:43.247
Sir, I know the protocol
in these circumstances,

32:44.240 --> 32:48.006
but could you please tell my dad first?

32:49.080 --> 32:52.129
I just think my mum would take it better
if it comes from him.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.242
We're not there yet. There's still time.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.925
Sir, please?

33:02.560 --> 33:06.201
Would you mind if I had
a brief moment alone with Fitz?

33:12.640 --> 33:13.846
Let's go.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.807
We'll try again.

33:22.880 --> 33:25.121
The electrostatic pulse from the third rat
seemed much less,

33:25.200 --> 33:29.967
so we're making progress.
If we can calibrate the anti-serum...

33:31.520 --> 33:35.764
Anti-serum, yes.
You finally got it right, Fitz.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.245
I'm so sorry.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.360
Aah!

33:50.400 --> 33:53.165
Agent Blake is on the line.
He wants to know what's going on.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.971
If you won't answer, he asked for Ward.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.884
Sir, what are our orders?

34:02.920 --> 34:03.967
They're unchanged.

34:05.480 --> 34:06.481
What is that?

34:08.120 --> 34:10.726
Someone's lowering
the cargo hold ramp.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.324
What the hell?

34:23.960 --> 34:26.327
Hey, it worked.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.531
The pulse just knocked
the rat unconscious...

34:31.159 --> 34:34.846
Jemma? Jemma!

34:36.639 --> 34:38.404
Jemma, it worked!

34:38.480 --> 34:40.482
What are you doing? No!

34:40.840 --> 34:42.683
Jemma, no!

34:44.639 --> 34:46.483
Jemma!

34:48.520 --> 34:50.487
Jemma!

34:57.560 --> 34:59.927
I'm coming. Come on, it's gonna be fine.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.843
It's gonna be fine, Jemma.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.844
The anti-serum works, but she jumped!

35:43.680 --> 35:45.250
--Ah!

35:54.120 --> 35:57.647
Don't get me wrong!
I'm happy you're both alive. Truly.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.167
And I realize you were trying
to save the team.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.369
But what you did today,
that was not your call.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.930
Just getting you out of the water,

36:06.680 --> 36:09.763
do you have any idea what a pain it is
dealing with the Moroccan office?

36:10.400 --> 36:14.405
Don't you ever
pull a stunt like that again!

36:17.440 --> 36:19.681
We'd hate to lose you, Jemma.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.564
Thank you, sir.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.169
Oh, does that mean we're to leave now?

36:38.400 --> 36:41.563
So, what'd you think
of your first time sky diving?

36:41.640 --> 36:44.689
Honestly, I'd rather not
think about it anymore.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.730
I thought what you did
was incredibly brave.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.446
Oh.

36:51.600 --> 36:56.447
Well, I suppose now's as good
a time as any to tell you that

36:57.640 --> 37:00.120
I may have misled you earlier.

37:01.640 --> 37:05.406
You see, when I gave you back
the Night-Night pistol, I lied.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.642
It's still an ounce off.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.847
I know.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.690
- You do?
-Of course.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.250
After all,

37:15.320 --> 37:17.084
"I'm Agent Grant Ward.

37:17.160 --> 37:20.130
"I just jumped out of a plane
without a parachute on

37:20.200 --> 37:21.247
"and saved your life!"

37:21.320 --> 37:22.765
Actually, that's not quite it.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.161
- It's a bit more nasally than that.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.447
Oh.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.010
Hello, Skye.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.760
Oh!

37:46.880 --> 37:48.006
How was Simmons?

37:51.200 --> 37:53.282
Amazingly resilient.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.805
You'd never know she almost died.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.566
An experience like that,
it takes a while to sink in.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.767
That her medical report?

38:03.840 --> 38:07.287
Mine, actually.
Blood work finally came back.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.407
I'm perfectly normal.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.801
Little heavy on the iron, but don't worry.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.769
You don't have
to start calling me Iron Man.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.409
Wasn't planning on it.

38:22.680 --> 38:25.411
My doctors never requested any tests.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.003
I ordered them for myself,
but you knew that.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.326
This piece of paper is telling me
that everything's fine.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.241
But I don't feel fine.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.050
I feel different.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.565
Take off your shirt.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.531
Excuse me?

39:02.080 --> 39:03.491
Your shirt.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.729
Unbutton it.

39:27.120 --> 39:31.444
Whether it was eight seconds or 40,
you died.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.282
There's no way
you can go through a trauma like that

39:35.360 --> 39:37.601
and not come out of it changed.

39:41.560 --> 39:44.484
- You know how long it's taken me to...
-I know.

39:48.040 --> 39:52.329
The point of these things
is to remind us that

39:54.840 --> 39:56.808
there is no going back.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.007
There's only moving forward.

40:06.480 --> 40:10.644
You feel different
because you are different.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.843
- And I was going to do it.
-I know you were.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.922
I had the anti-serum, the chute,
everything.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.161
I just couldn't get the straps on.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.287
Fitz, please.

40:21.360 --> 40:24.443
And maybe I couldn't
have done the whole James Bond

40:24.520 --> 40:28.445
-in-mid-air type of thing...
-Fitz, shut up. Please, just...

40:30.400 --> 40:33.210
Ward did an amazing thing, yes.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.521
But it wasn't Ward
by my side in that lab,

40:35.600 --> 40:37.568
searching for a cure.

40:38.440 --> 40:41.330
It wasn't Ward giving me hope
when I had none.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.731
It was you.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.569
You're the hero.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.683
- Yeah.
-Yeah.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.810
Thank you.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.722
- Blake.
-Coulson.

41:32.080 --> 41:33.320
That's the best
you could come up with?

41:33.400 --> 41:34.845
"We've got a bad connection"?

41:34.920 --> 41:36.922
- I was pressed for time.
-Bold move.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.490
You know our chat
wasn't exactly private.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.647
They never are.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.210
I don't know
what happened to you in New York,

41:41.280 --> 41:42.327
if you really flatlined,

41:42.400 --> 41:44.607
or if that's just what they tell us
when we reach Level 7.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.604
But whatever did happen
doesn't give you license

41:47.680 --> 41:49.205
to disobey an order from H.Q.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.567
And you keep pulling stunts like that,

41:51.640 --> 41:54.291
someone might decide to take
this little dream team away from you.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.647
I'd like to see them try.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.851
That doesn't sound like
the Phil Coulson I used to know.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.571
No, I suppose it doesn't.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.886
Get used to it.
