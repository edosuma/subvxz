[Chuckles]

09:01.323 --> 09:03.238
Um, it's OK I brought
Thea, too, right?

09:03.281 --> 09:04.979
Does it look OK?

09:05.022 --> 09:07.285
Simone, look, I know
she talked a lot of smack

09:07.329 --> 09:09.157
on the court that day
and things have been
pretty messy since.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.420
But she was just
spiraling, Simone.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.422
Look, she knows how important
your friendship is to me.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.989
She's chill now.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.512
Hey, Damon, you
should sit down.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.601
It's time to eat.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.256
Yeah. Real chill.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.521
J.R.: Yo, Dr. P.,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
what channel is your
R & B holiday music?

09:29.046 --> 09:31.353
J.R., turn that up.

09:31.396 --> 09:34.748
Reporter: ...was spotted in
a secret training session

09:34.791 --> 09:36.663
at Hawkins this morning.

09:36.706 --> 09:40.580
In keeping with NCAA rules,
Coach Shaw was nowhere in sight,

09:40.623 --> 09:43.191
but it appears the rumors
are true.

09:43.234 --> 09:46.498
Damon Sims is looking to enter
the transfer portal

09:46.542 --> 09:49.632
and leave Bringston University
behind.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.331
Seriously?

09:56.639 --> 09:59.337
Excuse me. Thank you
so much for brunch.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.817
Thea.

10:00.861 --> 10:03.733
I told you.
You should've told her.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.309
He really wants to play
for Coach Shaw?

10:14.352 --> 10:16.093
It's either that
or play for our dad.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.617
Simone: I guess better
the devil you know

10:17.660 --> 10:19.836
versus the devil you
want nothing to do with.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.708
Spencer: Ain't nobody
wondering who leaked
that video of him?

10:21.751 --> 10:23.666
Cam: Hey, I know I'm
late, y'all. My bad.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.190
Well, dang.
What'd I miss?

10:26.234 --> 10:27.235
Everything.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.150
Cam: I didn't realize

10:29.193 --> 10:31.065
we inviting everyone
to family meals now.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.806
At least he
showed up on time.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.546
OK. I'mma roll out.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.113
I got another workout
I got to get in.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.985
I'll go with you.
I got two-a-days,

10:38.028 --> 10:39.769
so I got to get back
on the court.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.815
Amara: But you know that you
can always talk to me, Damon.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.338
I know. I know.
I want to stay.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.645
All right? I do,
Dr. P. Believe me.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.559
I just don't know
how to play for...

10:47.603 --> 10:49.692
Coach Raymond after
everything he's done.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.694
I understand that things
are complicated

10:51.738 --> 10:53.653
with him being
your birth father.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.132
Is Coach Marcus coming
back anytime soon?

10:55.176 --> 10:57.700
I wish I knew, sweetie,

10:57.744 --> 10:59.702
but he's on leave
indefinitely,

10:59.746 --> 11:02.183
and he isn't
taking my calls.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.533
So that means that
Coach Raymond is gonna

11:04.576 --> 11:06.143
be my coach indefinitely.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.145
[Sighs]

11:08.189 --> 11:10.887
Listen, this is a big
personal decision, Damon,

11:10.931 --> 11:12.410
so take your time.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.674
You have to do
what's best for you.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.938
But as soon as you decide,
please let me know.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.549
I'm sure eventually, I'll
have to do some damage control

11:20.592 --> 11:22.203
with the trustees.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.948
Woman: You're very
quiet today, Marcus.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.601
Just thinking.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.212
Care to think
out loud?

11:31.255 --> 11:33.127
That's what I'm here for.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.700
Our last session,
we talked about

11:40.743 --> 11:42.527
how your time here is
coming to an end.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.356
And I sensed some
resistance on your part.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.358
I voluntarily checked
myself in here.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.013
Isn't it up to me
when I check myself out?

11:50.057 --> 11:51.493
I think the better
question is,

11:51.536 --> 11:53.147
why don't you want to
check yourself out?

11:53.190 --> 11:56.803
It's been 6 weeks, Marcus.
Your new meds are working.

11:56.846 --> 12:00.589
Group therapy worked.
Our sessions have worked.

12:00.632 --> 12:04.593
You asked me what I was
thinking about earlier.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.465
I was staring at
my distorted reflection

12:07.509 --> 12:10.294
in the glass covering
your artwork.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.601
Now, what if that's
how my players

12:12.644 --> 12:14.603
and my friends
see me now--

12:14.646 --> 12:20.783
distorted, broken,
different?

12:20.827 --> 12:23.525
What if it's not?

12:28.008 --> 12:30.271
Well, I appreciate
you walking me back.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.664
It's all good. You ready
to talk about it yet?

12:32.708 --> 12:34.536
Talk about what?

12:34.579 --> 12:35.842
Take your pick. Why
are you so relieved

12:35.885 --> 12:38.279
Jordan
didn't actually show,

12:38.322 --> 12:40.585
Damon leaving Bringston,
or whatever's going on
with you and your coaches?

12:40.629 --> 12:42.805
So nothing gets
past you, huh?

12:42.849 --> 12:45.721
I told you.
I'm just sitting back
and enjoying watching.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.984
OK. Well, how about this?

12:48.028 --> 12:49.812
I'll talk to you about
Jordan and Damon

12:49.856 --> 12:51.640
if you tell me
how you really feel

12:51.683 --> 12:53.207
post-break-up
with you and Liv.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.426
So tennis it is.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.254
Mm-hmm. Ha ha!

13:00.388 --> 13:01.345
[Sighs]

13:01.389 --> 13:02.825
[Clears throat]

13:02.869 --> 13:05.480
The only reason why
I made top 6 is

13:05.523 --> 13:07.482
because Thea's injured.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.745
And to be honest,
I don't think my coaches
think I'm good enough.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.703
What do you think?

13:11.747 --> 13:13.488
I think this semester,
this new year

13:13.531 --> 13:16.883
was supposed to be me
stepping into this epic era,

13:16.926 --> 13:19.102
creating a buzz around
my name in the conference,

13:19.146 --> 13:20.625
and two-a-days
back on campus.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.714
Nothing new, nothing epic.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.021
I mean, your coaches
could've chosen
anybody to move up.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.675
They chose you.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.982
Or they chose the best
of the worst.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.680
Wow. OK. Who are you,
and what have you done
with Simone Hicks?

13:31.723 --> 13:33.813
Spencer, I'm very serious.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.511
Me, too. You got
to dig deep, Sim,

13:36.554 --> 13:38.121
and find a way
to step your game up.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.949
When I first landed
at GAU,

13:39.993 --> 13:41.995
I had my ass handed
to me on that field.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.648
Coach Garrett hated me.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.563
So then what'd you do
to change his mind?

13:45.607 --> 13:48.305
I humbled myself, watched
a lot of my game tape,

13:48.349 --> 13:50.481
and really locked in
on my weaknesses,

13:50.525 --> 13:52.527
and I turned them
into strengths.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.490
Yo, we good?

13:59.534 --> 14:01.144
Do you realize how many times
we asked each other that

14:01.188 --> 14:02.885
on Christmas break?

14:02.929 --> 14:04.756
All right. Look, I know
I was busy back in L.A.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.584
Busy?

14:06.628 --> 14:08.412
Look, we're back home
at Bringston now.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.632
Can we just, you know,
put the break behind us?

14:10.675 --> 14:11.981
It's a new year.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.635
Not quite yet.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.637
Do you mind? This
a private conversation.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.378
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna try
to woo my girl,

14:17.421 --> 14:19.815
at least be accurate.

14:21.686 --> 14:24.602
OK, yes, yes.
Tomorrow's New Year's Eve.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.909
And after our dinner
at Bertacchi's,

14:26.953 --> 14:28.868
we can spend
all night together

14:28.911 --> 14:31.261
talking and, well,
some other stuff.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.916
Uh, actually, um,
about that.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.788
I was thinking we
don't do Bertacchi's.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.356
No, no. Look, hear me
out, hear me out, OK?

14:39.400 --> 14:42.098
It's just that
New Year's can be

14:42.142 --> 14:43.752
a really
lonely time, and...

14:43.795 --> 14:45.319
well, Nate
doesn't have a date,

14:45.362 --> 14:46.929
so she shouldn't
be alone, right?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.496
Now, why am I in it?

14:48.539 --> 14:50.280
Well, Simone, too.
She ain't got nobody.

14:50.324 --> 14:53.893
Maybe we can all just do
something chill together.

14:53.936 --> 14:57.200
Oh, OK. I got to go.
I'm late.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.075
Keisha: So he wants to turn
our romantic New Year's Eve

15:02.118 --> 15:05.208
into a group hang.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.645
But you know what? Bet.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.865
Why stop at you and Simone?
Why not just invite everybody?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.912
I mean, I am due for
a good old-fashioned

15:12.955 --> 15:14.565
Keisha McCalla rager, so...

15:14.609 --> 15:16.741
Kee, what are you doing?

15:16.785 --> 15:18.308
Worrying about my damn self.

15:18.352 --> 15:21.964
Hey, we gonna party
on New Year's, Nate.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.880
And I think I know
just who to invite.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.577
[Telephone rings]

15:26.621 --> 15:29.276
[Knock on door,
laptop chimes]

15:29.319 --> 15:31.843
Jessie, now's not
a good time.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.455
I'm guessing the trustees
want answers just like I do.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.152
Did you know Damon
was leaving?

15:36.196 --> 15:38.154
He hasn't made
a decision yet.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.156
And, no, I had no idea.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.853
What are we gonna
do about it?

15:41.897 --> 15:44.944
We are going to give Damon
some room to breathe

15:44.987 --> 15:46.684
and let him
make his decision.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.557
The baseball season doesn't
start for another few weeks.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.733
Amara, if Damon leaves,
this baseball program
goes to hell.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.735
You need to do something.

15:53.778 --> 15:57.173
Jessie, you need to be
less worried about
losing your star pitcher

15:57.217 --> 15:59.306
and more worried
about losing your son.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.786
And you need to stop thinking
like everyone's fun aunt

16:01.830 --> 16:04.615
and start thinking
like a damn president.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.096
A trash baseball
program means

16:07.140 --> 16:09.011
a loss of recruiting power,
a loss of sponsorships,

16:09.055 --> 16:10.970
a loss of revenue
for this institution.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.667
Your predecessor
understood that.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.451
You can't afford to give
Damon a couple of weeks

16:14.495 --> 16:17.280
to be in his feelings.

16:17.324 --> 16:20.849
You need a decision
and a new plan now.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.767
[Door opens and shuts]

16:29.031 --> 16:31.903
Thea. Hey.

16:31.947 --> 16:34.123
Babe, wait. Wait.
Listen--listen...

16:34.167 --> 16:35.603
Do you know
how stupid I feel?

16:35.646 --> 16:37.387
You know, I thought
that we were building

16:37.431 --> 16:39.215
something real here
between us.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.651
We are.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.392
Right, which is why
you let me find out

16:42.436 --> 16:44.090
on the news that you're
transferring?

16:44.133 --> 16:46.483
And don't tell me about, you
just kept it from everyone

16:46.527 --> 16:49.312
because I could see on
J.R.'s face that he knew.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.010
So who else knew?

16:51.053 --> 16:52.446
Just listen to me, OK?

16:52.489 --> 16:54.883
I wanted to tell you
everything.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.928
You just had a lot going
on with your shoulder,
and I didn't know how--

16:56.972 --> 16:59.627
Damon, we all have a lot
going on. That's called life.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.151
And I know that.
[Cell phone vibrates]

17:02.195 --> 17:03.718
You should just check that.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.241
It's probably someone
more important than me.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.764
I will just turn
it off, OK?

17:06.808 --> 17:09.419
[Cell phone buzzes]

17:09.463 --> 17:12.161
It's Dr. P. She's--

17:12.205 --> 17:14.424
she's summoning me to
her office right now.

17:14.468 --> 17:18.124
Like I said, someone
more important than me.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.387
That's not--
[Exhales]

17:22.867 --> 17:25.914
Amara: Damon,
I know I told you
to take your time

17:25.957 --> 17:27.568
in making
your transfer decision,

17:27.611 --> 17:30.005
but, unfortunately,
the luxury of time is

17:30.049 --> 17:32.790
the one thing neither
of us has anymore.

17:32.834 --> 17:36.925
As president,
I need to put
this institution first.

17:36.968 --> 17:40.929
Um, what does
that mean, Dr. P.?

17:40.972 --> 17:43.149
It means you have
48 hours to decide

17:43.192 --> 17:45.064
if you're leaving
Bringston.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.377
J.R.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.379
Come on, Dad. Look,
I am not in it, all right?

17:56.423 --> 17:59.643
J.R., if Damon leaves,
it affects
your baseball team.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.558
This is not the time for
you to run from the fight.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.125
I'm just protecting
my peace.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.648
And, real talk,
I ain't mad at Damon

18:04.692 --> 18:06.172
for trying to protect his.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.695
This is not about
our family drama.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.175
This is about baseball.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.090
And that's your problem,
right, Dad?

18:11.133 --> 18:12.656
Because for me and Damon,

18:12.700 --> 18:14.354
it's about family
and baseball.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.965
Look, it took me a long time
trying to find my brother.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.185
I'm not gonna let anything
mess that up, especially you.

18:19.228 --> 18:22.231
So from this moment forward,
consider me Switzerland.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.233
If you want to talk to Damon
about staying on the team,

18:24.277 --> 18:26.670
that's for you guys
to settle, Dad.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.629
See you later, though.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.156
I want to thank you
for coming

18:34.200 --> 18:35.853
to help me out today.

18:35.897 --> 18:40.031
I realized last night,
I can't focus on my weaknesses

18:40.075 --> 18:41.555
if I can't see them.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.426
It's all good.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.429
I got an hour to kill
before J. picks me up
for practice.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.431
So you sure you got
everything?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.781
Lenses, all that?

18:50.825 --> 18:53.393
Yes. Look,
just go out there,
do your thing, kill it,

18:53.436 --> 18:55.090
and I'll take care
of the rest.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.266
Spence, relax. This is
just a practice match.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.834
Hey, act like
it's not.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.010
Go on.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.505
The floor nurse says you've
received a number of calls

19:18.548 --> 19:20.463
from an Amara Patterson.

19:20.507 --> 19:22.900
Maybe returning her call
would be a good way

19:22.944 --> 19:24.511
to ease
the outside world in.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.208
Maybe.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.558
Marcus, you've
shut out the world

19:28.602 --> 19:30.256
for quite a while now.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.083
No TV, no music.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.781
You're not taking calls
from your friends.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.261
You're gonna have to face
it all sometime.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.741
Isn't that proof that
I'm not ready?

19:37.785 --> 19:40.179
No. It's proof that
you're scared to try.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.485
The power's in you, Marcus.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.444
You're a remarkable man.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.228
And adding to
that, you're a coach.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.187
Any ignorance you encounter

19:48.230 --> 19:50.928
can just be
a teachable moment.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.017
Look at me.

19:56.282 --> 19:59.023
The world is a better place
with you in it,

19:59.067 --> 20:02.418
but you have to really be
in it for that to be true.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.249
I always tell my boys
fear is never the problem.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.425
We all fear.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.949
It's what we do with
that fear that matters,

20:11.993 --> 20:13.386
you know?

20:13.429 --> 20:18.260
Like I said,
remarkable man, great coach.

20:18.304 --> 20:21.698
Maybe it's time
you listen to yourself.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.060
Coach Ray--

20:38.976 --> 20:41.152
[Exhales]
Damn.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.290
Hey.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.466
Damon.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.120
Hey, what's up?

20:52.163 --> 20:53.295
Have you seen Spencer?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.602
Nah, bro, I haven't.

20:55.645 --> 20:57.517
Was it all
a joke to you?

20:59.867 --> 21:02.348
Look, bro, I got a lot
going on right now.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.480
You really don't want
to do this right now.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.482
You see, when Simone
and I were together,

21:06.526 --> 21:08.571
there was a lot I didn't
say out of respect

21:08.615 --> 21:10.312
for her and your
so-called friendship,

21:10.356 --> 21:12.314
but we're not
together anymore,

21:12.358 --> 21:14.838
so now, now seems like
a really good time.

21:14.882 --> 21:18.407
Dude, what is your problem?
I'm not even with your girl.

21:18.451 --> 21:19.974
Right, right. Because what?

21:20.017 --> 21:21.715
Because she's not
attractive to you

21:21.758 --> 21:23.456
unless she's unavailable?

21:23.499 --> 21:24.631
Unless you're stealing her out
from underneath somebody,

21:24.674 --> 21:26.328
it's not worth it to you?

21:26.372 --> 21:28.417
Oh, OK. I'm gonna need
you to watch your mouth

21:28.461 --> 21:30.463
and stop talking
about her like she's
a piece of property.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.334
You're really out
here trying to pretend
you give a crap about her?

21:32.378 --> 21:33.944
Where was all this
whenever you were busy
upending her life

21:33.988 --> 21:35.859
and then you got bored
and decided

21:35.903 --> 21:38.732
to hook up
with her friend instead?

21:38.775 --> 21:39.994
I'm done.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.082
Oh, you're done, huh?

21:41.125 --> 21:42.997
Guess what,
guess what.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.651
We are so not done.

21:44.694 --> 21:45.956
[Scoffs]

21:48.219 --> 21:51.527
You have 3 seconds
to get out of my face, dawg.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.488
[Applause]

21:59.013 --> 22:00.362
Keisha: Yes!

22:00.406 --> 22:01.450
Nathaniel:
Now, that was impressive.

22:01.494 --> 22:02.625
Simone: Thank you.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.105
What are y'all
doing here?

22:04.148 --> 22:05.411
I was actually
just coming to check

22:05.454 --> 22:06.934
to make sure you got

22:06.977 --> 22:08.283
the New Year's Eve invite

22:08.327 --> 22:09.502
for tonight's party
at chez moi.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.460
My bad. I got curfew.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.244
-What time is curfew?
-10:00.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.855
OK, well, then the party
starts at 9:00.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.378
You see how easy that was?

22:16.422 --> 22:17.379
What is she doing?

22:17.423 --> 22:18.424
Playing with fire.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.034
OK. Spencer?

22:20.077 --> 22:21.992
Spencer: Yeah.
Simone: We're leaving.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.864
I guess I'll see you tonight.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.169
See you tonight.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.742
Student: Come on, man. Be cool.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.616
Student: Hey, man.
Student 2: Hey, hey.

22:36.659 --> 22:39.227
Jessie: That's enough...
Spencer: Hey, hey!

22:39.270 --> 22:40.707
You out your damn mind?
You just got your hand back.

22:40.750 --> 22:41.882
Jordan: OK, OK.
Fine. I'm fine.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.274
Go on.
Get him out of here!

22:43.318 --> 22:45.364
Damon: Get off me.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.063
[Door slams shut]

22:52.022 --> 22:56.766
Damon, Damon. Damon,
you OK? What happened?

22:56.810 --> 22:59.421
Talk to me. What happened?

23:03.425 --> 23:05.296
I guess that fight was
a long time coming, huh?

23:05.340 --> 23:07.342
What?

23:07.386 --> 23:09.039
[Chuckles]

23:09.083 --> 23:11.041
I mean, when two guys
fall for the same girl,

23:11.085 --> 23:13.957
it's kind of
inevitable, Simone.

23:14.001 --> 23:17.265
Not when everyone
has moved on.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.185
Damon, what really
happened in there?

23:24.228 --> 23:26.535
[Sighs]

23:26.579 --> 23:30.060
Your aunt gave me
48 hours
to make a decision.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.411
I don't know.
The pressure,

23:32.454 --> 23:34.543
the fear of making
the wrong decision.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.545
I guess Jordan was
just running his mouth

23:36.589 --> 23:38.373
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.593
I get it.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.595
You know, I was
considering transferring

23:42.638 --> 23:45.206
last semester, too, right?

23:45.249 --> 23:47.338
So I get how overwhelming
a decision like that is,

23:47.382 --> 23:49.471
and I didn't even have
the family stuff
on top of it.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.951
Um...

23:50.994 --> 23:53.606
Do you maybe think you
can talk to your aunt?

23:53.649 --> 23:55.869
Buy me some more time?

23:55.912 --> 23:58.088
Damon, I would
if I actually thought

23:58.132 --> 23:59.786
it would make
a difference,

23:59.829 --> 24:01.744
but if my aunt
gave you 48 hours,

24:01.788 --> 24:03.920
then that's probably
all she has to give.

24:03.964 --> 24:07.358
But I'm here to listen
as long as you need me to.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.581
But Thea is probably
the person

24:12.625 --> 24:14.235
you need to talk to
about this stuff.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.672
So...

24:16.716 --> 24:19.936
I would if Thea would
actually talk to me.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.201
But thanks for the ice pack

24:24.245 --> 24:25.942
and the ear.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.118
I'll be straight.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.043
So you done
walking it off yet?

24:40.087 --> 24:41.958
Man. He just gets
under my skin.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.526
Oh, wait. For real?
I don't think nobody noticed.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.006
All right. This
isn't funny. Just...

24:46.049 --> 24:47.486
Yeah, you right.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.618
What's funny is you
fighting some dude

24:49.662 --> 24:53.143
who ain't dating
the girl that you ain't
even dating no more.

24:53.187 --> 24:56.973
The person you got
unfinished business
with is Simone, J.

24:57.017 --> 24:59.541
Y'all need some real
closure, like, yesterday.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.675
Whoa.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.198
Nice outfit.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.808
You good, bro?

25:05.852 --> 25:08.376
Why y'all even on campus?
You don't even go here.

25:08.419 --> 25:12.511
Whatever. Can you all
just not tell anyone

25:12.554 --> 25:14.077
you saw me delivering food?

25:14.121 --> 25:16.427
You mean don't tell Keisha?
[Chuckles]

25:16.471 --> 25:19.082
Y'all fools got the same
damn problem, man--

25:19.126 --> 25:20.344
communication.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.694
Y'all letting
your pride and ego

25:21.737 --> 25:23.652
stop you from talking
to the women

25:23.696 --> 25:26.699
you say mean a lot to you.

25:26.742 --> 25:30.137
Y'all gonna learn
the hard way. Watch.

25:51.071 --> 25:54.378
Announcer on TV: $500.
Want some spending money?

25:54.422 --> 25:56.467
Different announcer:
...is up to throw...

25:56.511 --> 25:58.774
All right. Sports.
Nice and easy.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.297
Man on TV:
Let's be clear.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.038
The only reason Sims'
potential transfer

26:02.082 --> 26:04.432
would even be valid
this time of year is

26:04.475 --> 26:06.260
because of the coaching
changes at Bringston,

26:06.303 --> 26:08.044
a loophole no one is
surprised Coach Shaw

26:08.088 --> 26:10.177
is readily taking
advantage of,

26:10.220 --> 26:12.005
although the portal
does open him up

26:12.048 --> 26:14.398
to any school that
wants him, not just Hawkins.

26:14.442 --> 26:17.924
Regardless, this
would be a major blow
to the Bringston Lions,

26:17.967 --> 26:20.535
who were poised for quite
the comeback this year.

26:32.808 --> 26:35.768
OK, well, this isn't
the outfit that I was
going for tonight,

26:35.811 --> 26:38.553
but at least
you're here.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.686
Well, actually,
I can't stay.

26:40.729 --> 26:43.079
Well, like, right now,
or you can't come to
the party at all?

26:45.865 --> 26:49.608
Wow. OK, Cam, if you
don't want to be
with me anymore,

26:49.651 --> 26:52.611
please just say that
because whatever game
you're playing

26:52.654 --> 26:54.613
hurts too much,
and I don't want to
do this anymore.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.702
I lost my football
scholarship.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.356
That's why I was
so distant in L.A.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.184
and didn't bring you home
to meet my parents.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.751
I had to tell them about it,

27:02.795 --> 27:05.232
and I knew that wasn't
gonna go well, so...

27:05.275 --> 27:07.234
I--I don't know.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.323
I guess the anxiety
about having to deal
with all that back home

27:09.366 --> 27:11.673
just brought out the old Cam
and my old insecurities.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.675
Wait. Wait. Wait.
What--what do you mean,

27:13.719 --> 27:15.721
you lost your
football scholarship?

27:15.764 --> 27:17.853
When? Why?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.550
The night of the step show.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.944
It was either make curfew
or perform with you,

27:21.988 --> 27:23.467
and I chose you.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.991
Oh, my God.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.209
Since then, I've been
working mad jobs

27:26.253 --> 27:27.907
to try and save money.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.865
That's why I've been
so M.I.A.

27:29.909 --> 27:32.215
Wait. But, Cam, that--
that was 6 weeks ago.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.043
Why didn't you
tell me sooner?

27:34.087 --> 27:35.741
I didn't want you
to feel responsible.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.134
I mean, that's why I didn't
have you meet my parents.

27:38.178 --> 27:41.050
I didn't want them to blame
you either. So instead--

27:41.094 --> 27:43.096
So instead, you
chose to gaslight me

27:43.139 --> 27:45.185
and make me feel
like I was crazy

27:45.228 --> 27:47.274
for thinking you were
lying and keeping
things from me

27:47.317 --> 27:49.058
when that's exactly
what you were doing
the whole time?

27:51.278 --> 27:53.280
OK, well, this outfit
makes more sense now.

27:53.323 --> 27:55.761
Don't let me keep you
from your shift.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.523
You need help?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.134
From you? No, thank you.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.484
I'd like to keep both
my shoulders intact.

28:23.527 --> 28:26.661
I don't even know
why I bother.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.229
Anyway, while you're busy
being high and mighty,

28:29.272 --> 28:30.926
you might want
to check on Damon.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.798
He could really use
your support right now.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.800
Oh, so now you're telling
me what my boyfriend needs.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.236
I'm not telling you anything.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.672
I'm trying to be
the bigger person here,

28:37.716 --> 28:39.413
but screw that and screw you.

28:39.456 --> 28:41.545
I actually have a match
to prep for.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.765
Simone, it won't make
a difference how much
you practice.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.115
You will never be me,
and you'll never beat me,

28:46.159 --> 28:48.204
even with my shoulder
messed up.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.381
I'm not
even gonna engage, Thea.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.648
Are you afraid
to play me?

28:57.692 --> 28:59.868
Are you crazy?

28:59.912 --> 29:02.915
You know what? Fine.
You want to be humiliated?

29:02.958 --> 29:04.264
Let's go.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.665
♪ She ain't nothing like,
nothing like me ♪

29:14.709 --> 29:17.190
♪ I am the first of my kind
