brother-in-law.

10:19.861 --> 10:22.362
You got any painkillers?
Strong ones?

10:22.514 --> 10:24.605
Yeah, let's get you
off the stretcher first.

10:24.699 --> 10:28.001
On my count. One, two, three.

10:29.612 --> 10:31.855
He can't hear.
His eardrum might have ruptured.

10:31.873 --> 10:32.856
What happened?

10:32.874 --> 10:34.782
The cannon exploded.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.209
Right. Did you say "cannon"?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.544
I-It was supposed
to fire blue or pink smoke.

10:38.697 --> 10:40.363
I-I'm the one
who talked him into it.

10:40.456 --> 10:42.715
Okay, easy. Let's just focus
on getting him better.

10:42.868 --> 10:44.384
Go get Will checked in, and
we'll take care of him, okay?

10:44.478 --> 10:46.369
-(grunts)
-IRVING: Whoa, looks like

10:46.388 --> 10:47.962
it hurts.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.205
Let's get 75 mics of fentanyl.

10:49.298 --> 10:50.540
HUNDLEY:
Okay. Try holding still, hon.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.300
You'll be feeling better
in a few seconds.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.545
Will, I'm gonna send you
for a scan to get

10:55.563 --> 10:56.988
a clear picture
of what's going on.

10:57.215 --> 10:58.731
-Okay?
-(Will coughs)

10:58.900 --> 11:00.450
(wheezing)

11:01.569 --> 11:03.995
I don't hear any breath
on the right.

11:04.147 --> 11:06.239
My chest, it hurts.

11:06.391 --> 11:09.058
His sats are starting to drop.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.317
No lung sliding.

11:10.412 --> 11:11.561
Looks like the shrapnel
collapsed the lung.

11:11.654 --> 11:14.589
We need a chest tube now.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.759
The doctor said
his lung collapsed

11:26.912 --> 11:28.244
and he could have
internal injuries.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.188
Yeah, I can't believe it either.

11:30.415 --> 11:32.691
Oh, I'll call you
when I know more, okay?

11:34.010 --> 11:37.011
We got his lung re-expanded,
he's breathing much better,

11:37.030 --> 11:40.181
-and he's on the way to CT.
-(exhales): Okay.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.758
-His parents?
-Yeah.

11:41.776 --> 11:44.369
They said I should have
talked him out of the cannon,

11:44.596 --> 11:48.164
but it was my stupid idea
in the first place.

11:49.267 --> 11:53.436
Oh, my God, I mean,
what a disaster.

11:53.455 --> 11:55.088
(sighs)

11:58.051 --> 12:01.444
One of his coworkers posted it.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.704
<i> -(screaming over video)</i>
-And it's already been reposted

12:03.782 --> 12:06.299
175 times.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.876
What? A-As if this
wasn't awful enough.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.562
(sighs)
Maybe put your phone away?

12:10.789 --> 12:12.880
Uh, "Latest addition
to the cesspool

12:13.049 --> 12:14.624
of gender reveal idiocy."

12:14.642 --> 12:17.293
"Stop blowing things up to tell
people your kid's got a penis."

12:17.295 --> 12:19.904
Scarlett, your friends love you.

12:20.056 --> 12:22.465
Who cares what a bunch
of strangers think?

12:22.525 --> 12:23.816
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

12:23.969 --> 12:25.468
Yeah.

12:25.561 --> 12:27.370
Thank you.

12:28.582 --> 12:32.492
CONRAD:
Troponin and BNP
are both elevated.

12:32.644 --> 12:34.327
She has leukocytosis
but no fever.

12:34.479 --> 12:38.147
Nothing is adding up.
We need answers.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.483
Her sats are drifting down.

12:40.485 --> 12:43.410
She's getting sicker
by the minute.

12:43.505 --> 12:45.579
Considering all those
TikTok notifications,

12:45.599 --> 12:47.581
she must have an account.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.351

tell us anything.

Wow. Scans taking
that long, huh?

13:10.365 --> 13:12.106
(chuckles)
She's our patient,

13:12.125 --> 13:13.533
we still don't know
what's wrong with her,

13:13.685 --> 13:14.942
so we're looking for clues
and Irving is trying

13:14.961 --> 13:16.369
to reach the family.

13:16.538 --> 13:19.613
180,000 followers.
Wow, that's impressive.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.966
Yeah, but it's not helping.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.469
Maybe this will.

13:25.363 --> 13:26.805
Trevor, take it from the top

13:26.956 --> 13:29.198
and walk us through it.

13:29.217 --> 13:31.384
Well...
(exhales)

13:31.478 --> 13:33.478
...the apices of the lungs
look clear.

13:33.705 --> 13:36.564
There's some scattered
focal ground-glass.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.316
Hold on, is that a, uh...

13:38.467 --> 13:40.209
-A filling defect.
-Yeah.

13:40.228 --> 13:43.470
Consistent with a huge clot
in her right pulmonary artery.

13:43.565 --> 13:45.565
Yeah, and smaller clots
in the distal arteries, too.

13:45.733 --> 13:48.217
Maybe they aren't blood clots.

13:48.236 --> 13:50.053
Then what are they?

13:50.055 --> 13:51.145
This pattern plus the rash,

13:51.239 --> 13:53.389
I'm thinking
fat embolism syndrome.

13:53.408 --> 13:57.560
Yeah, globules of fat
clogging up the vessels.

13:57.579 --> 13:59.987
That happens after fractures
or burns, right?

14:00.081 --> 14:02.489
But she didn't have those.

14:02.567 --> 14:03.583
Or pancreatitis.

14:03.735 --> 14:05.401
But liposuction would
explain all of it.

14:05.420 --> 14:08.404
The fat embolism,
the surgical port we saw.

14:08.423 --> 14:11.257
-(rapid beeping)
-AUSTIN: O2's in the 80s.

14:11.409 --> 14:12.976
149 heart rate. She's tanking.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.506
(coughing)

14:19.601 --> 14:21.601
CONRAD:
Hemoptysis. We need
to secure her airway

14:21.753 --> 14:23.010
before she aspirates.

14:23.104 --> 14:24.087
What the hell is going on?

14:24.105 --> 14:25.438
Let's intubate and find out.

14:25.532 --> 14:29.200
Gail, I need you to look
for two small injection sites

14:29.352 --> 14:31.369
on the patient's backside.

14:32.097 --> 14:34.330
Do you see them?

14:35.024 --> 14:36.357
Yes, I do.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.784
Prepare the intubation meds now.

14:38.861 --> 14:41.296
It's okay.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.396
AUSTIN:
All right, sats
are coming back up.

14:58.623 --> 15:01.457
Looks like Charli here got
herself a Brazilian butt lift.

15:01.550 --> 15:04.644
Aren't BBLs the most dangerous
procedure there is?

15:04.738 --> 15:07.739
Yeah, but I doubt they advertise
the high fatality rates.

15:07.966 --> 15:09.073
Right. They sell you
on the prospect

15:09.300 --> 15:10.591
of getting a curvier backside

15:10.593 --> 15:13.136
while losing inches
in the middle.

15:13.229 --> 15:14.412
Let's get her to ICU.

15:14.563 --> 15:15.914
I need to ultrasound
her heart to see

15:16.065 --> 15:19.542
where that runaway fat
is now calling home.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.649
BELL:
That does not look pretty.

15:26.668 --> 15:29.152
The tiniest bowel perf and
he could end up in septic shock.

15:29.170 --> 15:30.836
Jessica's brother-in-law?

15:30.989 --> 15:32.246
Yeah.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.656
We've admitted him
and I booked an OR,

15:33.675 --> 15:35.174
and as soon as it's ready,
we'll take him in.

15:35.326 --> 15:38.102
Uh-huh. And what happened?

15:38.254 --> 15:41.439
A gender reveal party
gone very wrong.

15:41.666 --> 15:43.483
A cannon was involved.

15:45.594 --> 15:48.004
Probably best if I don't know
the details.

15:48.022 --> 15:49.839
So, this could go south
really fast.

15:49.932 --> 15:53.025
He's gonna need
exploratory laparotomy.

15:53.178 --> 15:55.711
Well, I'm glad you're on deck.

15:55.713 --> 15:58.939
Uh, you're on deck. I'm a maybe.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.459
We need to talk.

16:13.364 --> 16:16.015
-(sighs)
-What's going on?

16:18.203 --> 16:19.960
Remember the last time
we operated together?

16:20.021 --> 16:21.370
I had some issues.

16:21.389 --> 16:25.299
And I contacted Conrad,
we had some tests run.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.726
And?

16:26.878 --> 16:29.404
I have MS.

16:30.639 --> 16:32.365
Multiple sclerosis?

16:35.236 --> 16:37.737
-I am so sorry, Dr. Bell.
-Thank you.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.756
I'm-I'm adjusting to the new
reality, with Kit's help.

16:40.758 --> 16:44.485
And on-on meds, I have
no symptoms, at least for now,

16:44.562 --> 16:48.464
and Conrad has cleared me
for surgery. However...

16:49.584 --> 16:50.341
...if you would prefer

16:50.493 --> 16:53.428
to work with another doctor...

16:54.663 --> 16:56.431
Absolutely not.

16:57.408 --> 16:59.425
This is a physical challenge.

16:59.577 --> 17:02.078
That's it.

17:02.096 --> 17:03.412
-(laughs softly)
-I have one, too.

17:03.431 --> 17:06.006
If you hadn't told me,
I'd never, uh, guess

17:06.059 --> 17:08.509
-that you have dyslexia.
-Thank you.

17:08.528 --> 17:13.422
But when I chose surgery,
my family, friends, advisors,

17:13.441 --> 17:15.182
everyone thought it would
make me dangerous.

17:15.201 --> 17:19.520
But with my work-arounds,
I believe I've...

17:19.539 --> 17:22.206
-You are one of the best.
-I don't know about that.

17:22.433 --> 17:26.127
But I do not let dyslexia
stand in my way.

17:27.363 --> 17:30.364
This is just
a new challenge to overcome.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.958
Well, thank you, Dr. Devi.

17:33.111 --> 17:34.635
Was a good pep talk.

17:37.632 --> 17:39.432
I'll see you in the OR.

17:53.965 --> 17:56.132
Man, when I was in my 20s,
the worst things

17:56.150 --> 17:57.408
we did to ourselves were
tattoos and piercings.

17:57.635 --> 17:58.910
-Guilty of the former.
-Latter for me.

17:59.061 --> 18:02.997
I got a gnarly infection
from my eyebrow ring.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.399
Oh, trust me, it was dope.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.810
-Until it wasn't.
-(laughter)

18:07.829 --> 18:09.236
Ah...

18:09.255 --> 18:12.164
Oh, this is no good.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.092
Charli's in trouble.

18:14.319 --> 18:16.168
Is that fat
sitting in her heart?

18:16.321 --> 18:17.411
Not just sitting,
it's in transit,

18:17.505 --> 18:19.488
from her right atrium
to her left.

18:19.507 --> 18:21.490
So she has a congenital hole
in her heart?

18:21.509 --> 18:23.267
AUSTIN:
Probably undetected before,

18:23.419 --> 18:25.177
but blew open
when she had the P.E.s.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.012
Maybe even acted
as a pop-off valve,

18:27.089 --> 18:29.273
-saving her life, but now...
-It's a bomb.

18:29.425 --> 18:32.351
-Primed and ready
to go off at any moment.
-Yeah.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.612
If it makes its way
into her arterial circulation...

18:34.763 --> 18:37.340
-She'll stroke out.
-AUSTIN: I'll text Dr. Sutton.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.300
If that fat embolizes
to her brain,

18:39.360 --> 18:41.510
we'll have minutes to intervene.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.663
(phone ringing)

18:46.960 --> 18:48.775
TREVOR:
Hopefully, it's her family.

18:48.870 --> 18:51.537
<i> CASSIE (over phone):</i>
<i> Charli, hon, this is Cassie</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:52.964
<i> calling from Enhanced Dreams.</i>

18:53.191 --> 18:54.190
<i> How you feeling</i>
<i> after your procedure?</i>

18:54.283 --> 18:55.466
TREVOR:
Actually, Cassie,

18:55.618 --> 18:57.042
you're speaking
with three doctors

18:57.195 --> 18:58.136
at Chastain Memorial Hospital

18:58.287 --> 18:59.378
who are trying
to save Charli's life.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.030
So if I had to guess, I'd say

19:01.123 --> 19:02.198
she's feeling pretty damn
miserable right now.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.884
Cassie, this is Dr. Hawkins.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.371
Did Charli get a Brazilian butt
lift at Enhanced Dreams?

19:08.464 --> 19:10.389
We're gonna take that as a yes.

19:10.541 --> 19:11.983
It's led to fat
embolism syndrome.

19:12.134 --> 19:15.319
We need to talk to her surgeon.

19:15.471 --> 19:17.137
(phone crackles)

19:17.157 --> 19:19.882
Uh-- Did she seriously
just hang up?

19:19.975 --> 19:21.141
She's not getting rid of us
that easy.

19:21.268 --> 19:22.718
Trevor, google Enhanced Dreams.

19:22.737 --> 19:24.412
We're calling Cassie back.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.147
TREVOR:
All right, here we go.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.960
"Enhanced Dreams
Plastic Surgery."

19:33.731 --> 19:36.081
-(line ringing)
-(sighs)

19:36.234 --> 19:38.158
(busy signal)

19:38.178 --> 19:39.568
(laughs)

19:39.737 --> 19:43.181
Great. Great, they're probably
busy hiding the evidence.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.017
I doubt they'll have time
to pack up and run

19:46.168 --> 19:48.911
-before my shift's over.
-Okay, that's not happening.

19:49.004 --> 19:51.063
But let's keep calling.

19:57.346 --> 19:59.755
Are you really calling me for
a stroke that hasn't happened?

19:59.774 --> 20:02.533
-Can't you just give her TPA?
-She's had a recent surgery.

20:02.685 --> 20:04.368
If we give her TPA,
she could bleed out.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.371
AUSTIN:
If that fat goes to her brain,
you will only have minutes

20:07.448 --> 20:09.765
to perform
an interventional thrombectomy.

20:09.858 --> 20:11.600
Well, sucking clots out
of the brain through the groin

20:11.694 --> 20:13.026
is not my specialty.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.195
I haven't done that procedure
since residency.

20:15.289 --> 20:17.030
-Just page IR.
-Come on, Sutton,

20:17.050 --> 20:18.573
you know those guys
don't work over the weekend.

20:18.701 --> 20:20.292
And if we page them,
they would not get here in time.

20:20.445 --> 20:23.721
And our only endovascular
neurosurgeon's on vacation.

20:23.948 --> 20:25.281
AUSTIN:
Sutton, we wouldn't
be asking you this

20:25.299 --> 20:27.725
if there was another option.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.638
Then I'll have to.

20:32.790 --> 20:37.109
I'd better go review
my head-neck vascular anatomy.

20:39.797 --> 20:41.614
(sighs)

20:43.985 --> 20:45.468
SCARLETT (sighs):
They're here.

20:45.486 --> 20:49.154
Dr. Bell, this is Will
and my sister Scarlett.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.414
-Such a pleasure.
-Dr. Bell

20:50.566 --> 20:52.825
is a nationally-recognized
trauma surgeon.

20:52.977 --> 20:54.493
Jess has told me
so much about you.

20:54.645 --> 20:56.754
-She's your biggest fan.
-Well, and I'm hers.

20:56.905 --> 21:00.816
We don't know what we would do
without her here at Chastain.

21:00.909 --> 21:04.428
So, the scans show that there
are multiple metal fragments

21:04.655 --> 21:06.989
peppered throughout
your abdomen.

21:07.008 --> 21:10.417
And in surgery,
we'll remove every fragment

21:10.511 --> 21:12.270
and we'll ensure
that the explosion

21:12.421 --> 21:14.847
didn't cause any other injuries
that we can't see on the scans.

21:14.999 --> 21:17.016
He's gonna be okay, right?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.259
He's in the right place,
but of course you should know

21:19.279 --> 21:21.670
surgery carries risks.

21:21.689 --> 21:23.781
And, Jessica,
I know it's your day off,

21:24.008 --> 21:25.283
but I would like you
to scrub in with me.

21:25.434 --> 21:28.786
'Cause, after all,
you are my right hand.

21:28.937 --> 21:30.454
You couldn't keep me out.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.957
Great.

21:33.108 --> 21:34.850
JESSICA:
Just gonna get this.

21:34.943 --> 21:36.627
-Okay.
-Yeah?

21:37.463 --> 21:39.046
BELL:
Ready?

21:44.195 --> 21:45.786
Promise me he'll be okay, Jess.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.139
Try not to worry. We're gonna
take great care of him.

21:48.290 --> 21:50.141
SCARLETT:
Okay.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.723
I love you so much,
and I am so, so sorry

21:57.817 --> 22:00.300
I talked you into that cannon.

22:00.469 --> 22:02.111
I love you.

22:11.739 --> 22:13.748
It's okay.

22:17.152 --> 22:19.628
Are you sure you're up
for this, Dr. Bell?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.082
It's just, the last time
we worked together,

22:23.158 --> 22:25.992
you didn't feel well
and you abandoned the surgery.

22:26.087 --> 22:28.012
You haven't been in the OR
since then.

22:28.163 --> 22:29.180
Yeah, no, I haven't been well.

22:29.407 --> 22:30.923
And I can explain
all that to you later,

22:31.075 --> 22:34.167
but the important thing is,
we figured out the problem,

22:34.187 --> 22:36.002
and I've been cleared
for surgery

22:36.097 --> 22:38.105
by both Kit and Conrad, so...

22:40.084 --> 22:41.842
...I think we're okay.

22:41.969 --> 22:44.028
Okay, yeah, mm-hmm.

22:47.425 --> 22:49.492
(exhales)

22:51.762 --> 22:53.762
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:53.781 --> 22:57.041
BELL:
Okay, through the fascia.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.212
It looks like a little oozing
from the liver.

23:01.363 --> 23:04.623
LEELA:
I'll get better exposure now.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.134
How are you doing, Dr. Bell?

23:08.036 --> 23:09.553
BELL:
All good.

23:14.209 --> 23:18.979
-Okay, one piece
of shrapnel: gone.
-(metallic clink)

23:25.479 --> 23:27.813
And another.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.481
LEELA:
I'm having trouble getting it.

23:29.634 --> 23:31.450
BELL:
I got it.

23:33.137 --> 23:35.454
It's such delicate work.

23:36.307 --> 23:38.416
LEELA:
Nice going.

23:40.068 --> 23:41.902
-Now, what is that?
-BELL: Oh, that

23:41.996 --> 23:44.313
looks like another
piece of shrapnel.

23:44.331 --> 23:48.092
This time it's wedged
into the liver.

23:48.169 --> 23:50.594
Removing the foreign body now.

23:51.489 --> 23:53.338
LEELA:
Suction.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.598
Lap pads.

23:54.842 --> 23:57.268
Looks like this went
into the liver and hit a vessel.

23:57.495 --> 23:58.936
CHU:
You guys got
into something big.

23:59.087 --> 24:00.253
I'm maxing my pressors.

24:00.347 --> 24:01.588
BELL:
It's gonna be okay.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.833
Initiating massive
transfusion protocol.

24:04.852 --> 24:08.187
Okay, Dr. Devi, I need you
to help me get down to the aorta

24:08.339 --> 24:10.364
to cross-clamp...

24:11.358 --> 24:12.599
...and get control of this.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.009
CHU:
I'm transfusing the second unit

24:14.028 --> 24:15.344
of blood, four liters
of crystalloid,

24:15.362 --> 24:17.029
two of albumin,
and still losing.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.181
-Blood pressure isn't budging.
-BELL: Okay, we're gonna need

24:19.200 --> 24:20.624
supraceliac control.

24:20.851 --> 24:23.202
Page AJ stat for a thoracotomy.

24:23.354 --> 24:25.020
<i> CONRAD:</i>
<i> He's on deck in the OR suite.</i>

24:25.039 --> 24:26.112
<i> I'm calling him now.</i>

24:26.190 --> 24:27.372
<i> BELL:</i>
<i> Good, thank you.</i>

24:27.467 --> 24:28.874
<i> CHU:</i>
<i> No blood pressure detected,</i>

24:28.968 --> 24:31.026
but HR reading 160.

24:31.028 --> 24:32.953
AUSTIN:
All right, somebody talk to me.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.546
JESSICA:
Thank you for coming so fast.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.366
BELL:
Unavoidable bleeding
after shrapnel removal.

24:37.535 --> 24:38.367
We need better control
from above

24:38.460 --> 24:40.126
to be able to repair the defect.

24:40.295 --> 24:42.128
-That's why we called you.
-All right, let's get to it.

24:42.297 --> 24:44.023
AUSTIN:
Scalpel me.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.030
Spreaders.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.332
Clamp.

25:04.228 --> 25:07.838
All right.
Voilà, that should do it.

25:08.065 --> 25:09.173
(monitor beeps)

25:09.366 --> 25:11.175
We've got a blood pressure back.

25:11.326 --> 25:13.719
AUSTIN:
All right.

25:15.256 --> 25:16.421
BELL:
Glad you're in the house.

25:16.516 --> 25:19.391
AUSTIN:
Hey, man, glad to be here.

25:30.512 --> 25:32.512
<i> WOMAN: Any available resident</i>
<i> to ICU Three.</i>

25:32.606 --> 25:33.847
<i>Available resident to ICU Three.</i>

25:33.866 --> 25:35.274
Hey, look,
if you're gonna ask me

25:35.350 --> 25:37.034
to back off surgery again,
that's okay,

25:37.261 --> 25:38.594
but I-I want
to say I called in AJ

25:38.763 --> 25:40.763
because we needed him,
not because of the MS.

25:40.781 --> 25:44.208
I know, and Will is alive
because you made that call.

25:44.359 --> 25:47.527
I just wanted to say
welcome back.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.529
(laughs softly)
Thanks.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.757
It's good to be back.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.134
Dr. Sutton?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.727
Do you have a moment?

26:05.790 --> 26:06.972
Sure.

26:07.141 --> 26:08.548
It's been a while since
I've approached the brain

26:08.642 --> 26:10.309
from this direction.
I could use a break.

26:10.461 --> 26:13.629
Just trying to get
my muscle memory to kick in.

26:13.647 --> 26:15.981
I wanted to chat with you
some more about the idea

26:16.133 --> 26:18.534
of double-boarding
with cardio and neuro.

26:19.394 --> 26:20.560
Go on.

26:20.729 --> 26:24.323
I know you think I'm crazy--
and so does Devon--

26:24.475 --> 26:26.900
but people said the same thing
to me when I decided

26:26.994 --> 26:28.160
to become a surgeon
with dyslexia.

26:28.312 --> 26:30.813
Yes, but it's not
the same thing.

26:30.831 --> 26:33.665
Maintaining excellence in both
specialties is impossible.

26:33.742 --> 26:37.744
Expertise comes from repetition,
which is why this IR procedure

26:37.763 --> 26:38.912
is so tough.

26:39.006 --> 26:40.431
And trying to maintain
competency in both,

26:40.658 --> 26:41.765
it isn't enough.

26:41.951 --> 26:43.342
Okay, but I...

26:43.494 --> 26:45.603
Listen, I have
to get back to this.

26:45.754 --> 26:48.105
Let's talk about it later, okay?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.566
Okay.

26:58.509 --> 27:01.193
You're not gonna believe this.

27:01.345 --> 27:02.602
What am I looking at?

27:02.696 --> 27:04.863
The Enhanced Dreams
Instagram page.

27:05.015 --> 27:07.107
This surgery was live
this morning.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.959
And that might even be Charli.

27:09.111 --> 27:11.795
<i> CASSIE:</i>
<i> At Enhanced Dreams,</i>
<i> dreams really do come true,</i>

27:11.947 --> 27:14.873

27:25.144 --> 27:27.394
<i> Let me hear you say "thicc."</i>

27:28.630 --> 27:30.055
They need to be stopped.

27:30.207 --> 27:32.224
-Patient was awake?
-Mm-hmm.

27:32.376 --> 27:34.376
She likely gave permission
to film it.

27:34.395 --> 27:38.138
Maybe, but Enhanced Dreams
is run by a dermatologist,

27:38.157 --> 27:39.156
not a plastic surgeon.

27:39.307 --> 27:40.824
It's got to be illegal.

27:40.976 --> 27:42.826
Eh, you would think,
but it's not.

27:42.978 --> 27:45.237
Anyone with a medical license
can perform

27:45.389 --> 27:46.830
cosmetic surgery in Georgia.

27:46.982 --> 27:50.501
Chalk it up to ridiculous things
that are legal in medicine.

27:50.728 --> 27:52.544
(monitor beeping rapidly)

27:56.175 --> 27:58.250
We got you, Charli.
We got you, we got you.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.584
-(muffled grunting)
-We got you.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.178
CONRAD:
She's stroking out.

28:01.329 --> 28:02.680
-Page Billie!
-TREVOR: Shouldn't we get a CT

28:02.907 --> 28:04.014
with contrast
to figure out where?

28:04.166 --> 28:06.074
No time. It's localized

28:06.168 --> 28:07.351
to the left middle
cerebral artery.

28:07.428 --> 28:08.927
That's the best we can give
Billie right now.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.729
Let's get her to IR.

28:18.180 --> 28:20.614
(phone rings)

28:23.035 --> 28:25.260
Nice to hear from you.

28:25.279 --> 28:27.262
So, you have news
about the board seats?

28:27.281 --> 28:29.264
I do.
(exhales)

28:29.283 --> 28:31.950
Dr. Bell, we received
an accusation from, uh,

28:32.027 --> 28:34.436
your hospital about one
of our top candidates.

28:34.455 --> 28:36.288
Well, if you're talking
about Porter,

28:36.440 --> 28:38.790
I gather there were some
ethics complaints against him,

28:38.867 --> 28:40.108
but I...

28:40.127 --> 28:41.868
assumed you were aware.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.278
No, this is new.

28:43.371 --> 28:44.537
Uh...

28:44.557 --> 28:48.450
the credibility of the source
is the issue.

28:48.469 --> 28:51.544
It came from the same person
who wrote your recommendation

28:51.564 --> 28:53.480
<i> at Chastain.</i>

28:55.050 --> 28:56.141
Dr. Sutton?

28:56.293 --> 28:57.960
<i> Conflict of interest here</i>

28:58.053 --> 28:59.628
is, uh...

28:59.646 --> 29:01.480
obvious. And it's...

29:01.574 --> 29:04.633
<i> not a stretch to imagine</i>
<i> you helped motivate this.</i>

29:04.802 --> 29:07.244
Well, I-I assure you, I did not.

29:07.395 --> 29:09.154
Sadly, that's hard to believe.

29:09.306 --> 29:10.914
So we can no longer offer you
a position

29:11.066 --> 29:12.824
on the state medical board.

29:12.977 --> 29:14.643
<i> The optics...</i>

29:14.661 --> 29:16.311
<i> could not be worse.</i>

29:16.330 --> 29:18.146
(exhales)

29:18.165 --> 29:20.716
Uh, thanks for the call.

29:25.506 --> 29:26.579
I reached the mom.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.081
She took Charli's son
to Disney World

29:28.100 --> 29:29.582
while she had surgery.

29:29.602 --> 29:32.511
Apparently, Charli's desperate
for more followers.

29:32.663 --> 29:33.662
If she hits 200K,

29:33.755 --> 29:35.330
she can make cash, quit her job,

29:35.423 --> 29:36.681
and get a place
for her son and her.

29:36.834 --> 29:38.683
So she decided to get
a Brazilian butt lift?

29:38.852 --> 29:41.594
Her mom said she's always coming
up with ideas to look better.

29:41.688 --> 29:43.280
She thinks that's how
she'll get more followers.

29:43.431 --> 29:45.598
No one could talk her out of it.

29:45.767 --> 29:47.025
Do they know how sick she is?

29:47.177 --> 29:48.510
Her mom does.

29:48.603 --> 29:50.270
Hasn't told the kid.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.581
Hopefully she won't have to.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.702
Hey, Billie, can we talk?

29:57.855 --> 29:59.521
Can it wait? I'm due in IR.

29:59.614 --> 30:01.540
No, it can't. I got a call from
the lieutenant governor saying

30:01.616 --> 30:04.384
you filed a complaint
against Robert Porter.

30:05.453 --> 30:06.970
That was supposed
to be anonymous.

30:07.122 --> 30:09.139
Well, what was?
What the hell's going on?

30:09.366 --> 30:11.366
I can't-- I-I can't think

30:11.459 --> 30:12.367
-about this right now...
-Well, look, look,

30:12.386 --> 30:13.535
whatever this is,

30:13.554 --> 30:15.203
I mean, they think
that I put you up to it,

30:15.222 --> 30:16.721
because you signed
my letter of recommendation.

30:16.890 --> 30:18.148
And now the state medical board

30:18.300 --> 30:20.375
is siding with Porter and...
(stammers)

30:20.394 --> 30:21.543
cutting me.

30:21.712 --> 30:24.822
Billie, we have a patient
waiting. Let's go.

30:25.049 --> 30:25.823
-So?
-(sighs)

30:25.974 --> 30:28.325
I've got to go.

30:38.228 --> 30:39.628
How'd your IR practice go?

30:41.415 --> 30:42.756
We'll find out.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.175
Well, don't worry.

30:45.327 --> 30:47.594
I know this anatomy well.

30:57.264 --> 30:58.747
(steady beeping)

30:58.840 --> 31:01.841
It's heartbreaking that this
young woman put her life at risk

31:01.861 --> 31:03.268
for more followers.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.103
It was also to give her son
a better life.

31:05.255 --> 31:08.115
It's sad she believed this was
her best option to do that.

31:12.187 --> 31:15.747
Just at the takeoff to
the left middle cerebral artery.

31:19.603 --> 31:21.211
Come on, Billie.

31:21.363 --> 31:23.363
Dr. Sutton,
you're turned around.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.340
You're in
the right-sided circulation.

31:26.534 --> 31:27.792
I know where I am.

31:27.945 --> 31:29.219
The patient has
left-sided weakness.

31:29.371 --> 31:30.536
We need to get to the right side

31:30.556 --> 31:32.647
-of the brain.
<i> -CONRAD: She's confusing</i>

31:32.649 --> 31:34.540
-the patient's symptoms.
-LEELA:
All of the patient's deficits

31:34.560 --> 31:36.618
were on the right,
which means the embolism

31:36.637 --> 31:38.395
has to be on the left.

31:39.456 --> 31:40.288
(sighs)

31:40.307 --> 31:42.882
Neuroanatomy 101.
(exhales)

31:42.902 --> 31:44.126
(inhales deeply)

31:44.128 --> 31:47.029
Damn it. Where am I?

31:47.907 --> 31:49.314
What's happening?

31:49.466 --> 31:50.982
Looks like she's freezing up.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.077
She never loses focus like this.

31:54.896 --> 31:55.913
LEELA:
It's all right.

31:56.064 --> 31:58.290
We're almost there.

31:59.643 --> 32:03.587
Right here is the left anterior
cerebral artery.

32:03.738 --> 32:08.592
And here is the takeoff
to the middle cerebral artery.

32:10.245 --> 32:13.430
<i> CONRAD:</i>
<i> There you go, Billie.</i>

32:15.100 --> 32:16.266
She found the embolism.

32:16.418 --> 32:19.419
And now they pull it out?

32:19.513 --> 32:20.345
Yeah.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.439
<i>It's safer than breaking it up.</i>

32:22.590 --> 32:24.590
<i> TREVOR:</i>
<i>She's gonna be okay now, right?</i>

32:24.610 --> 32:27.653
If they got there in time.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.680
Thanks for having my back.

32:38.699 --> 32:40.749
Anytime.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.138
You okay?

32:57.459 --> 32:58.624
No.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.061
I'm furious with myself.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.373
Do you want to talk about it?

33:05.467 --> 33:07.442
Not really.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.823
But this is a clear example
of why you can't double-board

33:12.974 --> 33:14.408
in these two fields.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.735
I don't understand.

33:16.887 --> 33:19.496
My mind was
a million miles away.

33:19.647 --> 33:21.832
Dr. Austin juggles
multiple specialties.

33:22.059 --> 33:23.558
He's triple-boarded.

33:23.651 --> 33:25.076
Not in neurosurgery.

33:25.820 --> 33:29.339
This is as high-risk and complex
as any surgery gets.

33:29.416 --> 33:31.341
If you try and do this
and anything else,

33:31.418 --> 33:33.068
the result will be catastrophic.

33:33.161 --> 33:35.512
I rise to challenges.

33:35.589 --> 33:36.829
Okay? It's who I am.

33:36.923 --> 33:38.181
A challenge is good.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.999
A suicide mission is not.

33:40.019 --> 33:41.667
And in this case,
the person you'd kill

33:41.762 --> 33:42.853
would be the one on the table.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.913
-But you haven't even g...
-Leela,

33:44.931 --> 33:48.525
you may need to ask yourself
why you are putting up mountains

33:48.752 --> 33:51.361
too big for anyone to climb.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.532
Is that your final answer?

33:57.261 --> 34:00.412
Honestly, it would be anyone's.

34:02.599 --> 34:04.666
(phone buzzes)

34:10.198 --> 34:12.132
Thanks again for your help.

34:13.794 --> 34:15.719
(door opens)

34:17.464 --> 34:19.097
(sighs)

34:27.307 --> 34:31.902
I had to tell Randolph
after what Beaumont said.

34:31.978 --> 34:33.386
I'm so sorry, Billie.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.072
I should have realized
this could happen.

34:35.299 --> 34:36.481
KIT:
But it shouldn't have.

34:36.633 --> 34:38.241
You were promised
confidentiality.

34:38.468 --> 34:39.559
And the lieutenant governor
broke

34:39.636 --> 34:42.704
that promise.
It's just outrageous.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.640
So what do I do now?

34:46.476 --> 34:49.711
You said you could prove
your charges against Porter.

34:50.997 --> 34:53.197
(sighs)
I can.

34:53.926 --> 34:56.742
But it means devastating
emotional repercussions

34:56.762 --> 34:57.836
for the other person involved.

34:57.930 --> 35:00.913
Oh, Billie, I understand.

35:01.007 --> 35:02.507
But if you don't,

35:02.659 --> 35:05.585
I fear the repercussions for you
could be far worse.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.163
Accusers destroy
the person accusing them.

35:08.256 --> 35:11.024
That's how it works.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.573
Jess.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.508
Oh.

35:20.527 --> 35:21.952
-Thank you.
-Oh.

35:22.179 --> 35:23.027
Thank you so much.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.438
I am just so happy

35:25.457 --> 35:26.531
that he's okay.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.033
-That was really stressful.
-(chuckles)

35:29.128 --> 35:30.627
Oh, God, you would not believe

35:30.796 --> 35:33.463
things that people are saying
about me and Will.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.523
"Let's just hope the husband
is shooting blanks now

35:35.542 --> 35:38.360
so these two nitwits can't bring
a second child into the world."

35:38.378 --> 35:41.045
Will is fine. You'll have
plenty more children,

35:41.198 --> 35:42.213
-if you want them.
-Mm.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.048
In a couple of days,
these vultures

35:44.143 --> 35:45.809
will be attacking someone else.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.477
Mm, I'm thinking
of making T-shirts

35:47.704 --> 35:49.813
with the worst comments
printed on them.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.131
(inhales deeply)
Truth is,

35:52.151 --> 35:54.376
I feel like I kinda deserve it.

35:54.469 --> 35:56.394
You don't.

35:56.563 --> 35:57.970
Well, it's just...

35:58.732 --> 36:03.326
The only opinion of me that
really matters, besides Will's,

36:03.553 --> 36:04.494
is yours.

36:05.405 --> 36:07.055
-And I just hope
that you're not...
-Scarlett,

36:07.224 --> 36:09.057
you are my sister.

36:09.075 --> 36:11.501
I love you, no matter what.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.398
I feel like there's always
a "no matter what" with me.

36:16.416 --> 36:19.659
You were great at anything
you put your mind to.

36:19.678 --> 36:23.087
The only thing I put my mind to
were boys and parties.

36:23.164 --> 36:25.407
And you never needed
anyone's approval but your own.

36:25.425 --> 36:28.334
And Mom told me I wouldn't need
so much attention

36:28.353 --> 36:30.078
if I just took a page out
of your book.

36:30.096 --> 36:32.080
Oh, Scarlett.

36:32.098 --> 36:33.857
You are a ray of sunshine.

36:33.934 --> 36:36.918
And you bring it to Will,
and he loves you for it.

36:37.011 --> 36:39.103
Aw. But?

36:39.256 --> 36:41.214
But maybe nix the T-shirt idea.

36:41.349 --> 36:43.683
-Mm.
-No sense in feeding the trolls.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.352
And definitely a hard no
on backyard explosives.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.930
-(chuckles) That's sound advice.
-(chuckles)

36:49.023 --> 36:52.375
We still don't know
if it's a boy or a girl.

36:53.194 --> 36:55.212
Well, if you must know...

36:55.363 --> 36:57.288
-he's a little boy.
-(gasps)

36:57.441 --> 36:59.123
I saw the weenie
on the ultrasound.

36:59.276 --> 37:00.383
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

37:00.610 --> 37:02.034
-Scarlett.
-What?

37:02.128 --> 37:04.054
So why the party?

37:04.130 --> 37:05.964
Is that a serious question?

37:06.116 --> 37:07.449
-Do you not know your sister?
-(laughs)

37:07.467 --> 37:09.184
(Scarlett laughs)

37:10.954 --> 37:13.063
Hiya, honey.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.070
Hey.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.615
Can you squeeze my hands?

37:25.059 --> 37:28.227
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

37:28.396 --> 37:30.563
Good.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.823
All right.

37:31.975 --> 37:33.308
What happened?

37:33.326 --> 37:34.659
Well, in a nutshell, the fat

37:34.753 --> 37:37.570
from your Brazilian butt lift
swam to your brain

37:37.664 --> 37:39.481
and it almost paralyzed you.

37:39.499 --> 37:42.008
Oh, my God.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.152
Oh, God.

37:44.245 --> 37:45.169
I feel like such an idiot.

37:45.322 --> 37:46.337
I shouldn't have done it.

37:46.506 --> 37:48.247
I just-- I saw this thing
on Instagram

37:48.267 --> 37:49.599
-and...
-TREVOR: Oh, we know it.

37:49.826 --> 37:51.601
Frustratingly legal and yet...

37:51.828 --> 37:53.436
criminally unqualified.

37:54.589 --> 37:58.349
They had these glamour shots,
and I just thought that...

37:58.502 --> 38:00.335
damn, if I could look
like that...

38:00.353 --> 38:03.113
-(sighs)
-You could get more followers?

38:03.340 --> 38:04.781
We spoke to your mom.

38:04.932 --> 38:05.931
She knows?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.284
AUSTIN:
Yep.

38:07.511 --> 38:10.178
But she also knows
that you're gonna be okay.

38:10.196 --> 38:12.347
And Daniel? My-my son.

38:12.365 --> 38:14.106
(stammers) He's
probably so scared right now.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.584
-(sniffles)
-It's up to you
what you tell him.

38:17.521 --> 38:19.337
Thank you.

38:21.282 --> 38:24.426
Whew. So, how does it look?
(chuckles softly)

38:26.287 --> 38:28.722
Sorry, how does what look?

38:31.384 --> 38:34.728
I hope it looks dope,
like, after all that.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.632
Well, when you are up
and around,

38:39.726 --> 38:42.360
you can decide for yourself.

38:43.396 --> 38:45.380
Oh, can I have my phone, please?

38:45.398 --> 38:47.157
Yeah.

38:47.308 --> 38:49.159
People need to know about this.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.745
Uh, I got to grab Gigi.
I'll catch you guys later.

38:52.739 --> 38:54.497
Thank you.

38:59.229 --> 39:02.154
People, I almost died, y'all.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.247
But I didn't. I didn't.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.008
Okay, so I'm here to tell you,

39:05.159 --> 39:07.010
if you are going to get a BBL

39:07.161 --> 39:08.769
or any other procedure,

39:08.771 --> 39:12.090
make sure your doc knows what
the hell they're doing. Okay?

39:12.242 --> 39:14.258
So, sit back, relax

39:14.427 --> 39:18.413
and let me tell you
my crazy story, okay?

39:18.431 --> 39:20.582
Now, I am an optimist by nature,

39:20.600 --> 39:23.360
but I'm beginning to think
we are screwed as a species.

39:23.511 --> 39:26.345
Social media
is gonna be our meteor.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.939
Wow.

39:28.091 --> 39:29.273
You sound like an angry old man

39:29.426 --> 39:30.608
on the wrong side
of the generation gap.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.110
(chuckles):
Oh, wow.

39:32.262 --> 39:34.779
Angry, yes. Old, no.

39:34.931 --> 39:36.206
Mm, come on, Dr. Austin.

39:36.282 --> 39:37.615
Disco didn't destroy society.

39:37.784 --> 39:40.377
Without social media,
there would be no, uh,

39:40.604 --> 39:41.769
Arab Spring.

39:41.788 --> 39:43.438
Systemic racism
might've never been exposed.

39:43.607 --> 39:45.957
What about that girl
that saved herself by learning

39:46.109 --> 39:46.958
the "help me" gesture

39:47.110 --> 39:48.276
-on TikTok?
-Oh. Right.

39:48.294 --> 39:50.202
And all the swag you get

39:50.222 --> 39:52.389
when your followers leap up.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.632
Who follows you?

39:54.726 --> 39:56.059
And why?

39:56.970 --> 39:58.210

40:39.996 --> 40:41.729

Hey.

40:50.523 --> 40:52.356
-Thanks for collecting her.
-Oh,

40:52.433 --> 40:54.175
my pleasure.
(chuckles softly)

40:54.194 --> 40:56.344
It's amazing how well she plays.

40:56.362 --> 40:58.604
I swear, most kids
are so hooked on devices,

40:58.698 --> 40:59.772
they never learn how.

40:59.866 --> 41:00.957

-until at least college.
-(laughs)

Good luck with that.

Daddy, look.

41:05.279 --> 41:08.039
Oh, what's Mr. Giraffe
doing now?

41:08.191 --> 41:09.357
Can't you tell?

41:09.375 --> 41:10.875
Mm...

41:11.027 --> 41:14.529
He didn't pick up his toys,
so you sent him to his room.

41:14.547 --> 41:15.305
Zoo.

41:15.456 --> 41:17.532
Mr. Giraffe lives in the zoo.

41:17.550 --> 41:18.883
Right.

41:19.202 --> 41:22.887
Let's spring him from his cage
and go get your "carbon-ye-ara."

41:23.039 --> 41:24.481
Yes.

41:24.632 --> 41:26.891
(grunting loudly)

41:27.043 --> 41:28.318
(chuckling):
Bye.

41:28.469 --> 41:30.044
-Bye.
-Bye, Gigi.
-Bye.

41:30.137 --> 41:31.654
(kissing)
Mwah!

41:31.881 --> 41:33.698

(car door opens)

41:43.226 --> 41:45.502
(car door shuts)

41:49.065 --> 41:50.715
I won't hurt you.

41:53.086 --> 41:55.011
I'm here to warn you.

41:55.162 --> 41:57.347
Withdraw the complaint,
say you lied for Dr. Bell,

41:57.498 --> 41:59.724
and you'll never hear
from me again.

42:01.836 --> 42:03.002
You're scared.

42:03.096 --> 42:05.188
Withdraw it

42:05.339 --> 42:08.066
or I will destroy you.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.919
You can't destroy me.

42:12.531 --> 42:16.090
You killed a part of me
I can never get back.

42:16.183 --> 42:18.017
You can never hurt me again.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.428
Don't count on it.

42:20.521 --> 42:22.446
I'm fully aware
of your mistakes.

42:22.541 --> 42:24.115
I'll expose all of them.

42:24.267 --> 42:27.935
And I will take away the
very thing you love the most,

42:28.029 --> 42:29.420
your career.

42:37.647 --> 42:39.463
