WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.769
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.671
- Richie, what's up?

00:05.673 --> 00:08.507
- If I tell you something,
can you keep me out of it?

00:08.509 --> 00:10.042
- I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, okay?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.177
- I think I know
where the gun is.
- What're you doing?!

00:12.312 --> 00:14.413
- Sorry, duff. Ds orders.
- Ah!

00:14.482 --> 00:16.247
- Oh. Where'd that come from?

00:16.283 --> 00:17.916
- Union argued that we didn't
have enough

00:17.918 --> 00:20.452
Evidence to let them go,
but that everyone

00:20.488 --> 00:22.988
Would be better served
if we moved them to b&e.

00:22.990 --> 00:25.724
- Alright, just be yourself.
Lean into what's real.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.392
- Like len and the beretta
were real.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.795
- Yeah, actually, they were.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.430
- Kelly marie?
- Len grierson.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.465
- I'm undercover, alright?
- Ditto.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.000
- You're investigating
sons of jupiter?

00:35.002 --> 00:36.901
- Project voltage.
- We want vicky.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.704
A gun she made
nearly killed a cop.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.139
It'll take a little investment
from our part:

00:41.208 --> 00:42.808
$20,000 from the flash fund.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.343
<i> - Marc couldn't be here?</i>
- I can't see a thing.

00:45.345 --> 00:46.845
<i> - You had your chance.</i>
- What are you doing?

00:46.980 --> 00:48.180
- Len's gone. He played us.

00:48.315 --> 00:49.748
- I was thinking about going
to florida

00:49.883 --> 00:51.316
To stay with grandma
for a little bit.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.518
I need a fresh start.
- I love you.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.968
- Obviously, her invisibility
cloak was a metaphor.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.570
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.239
Um, hiding her power,
she's concealing herself--

01:14.374 --> 01:15.307
- I see where you're going.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.442
- Yeah?
You know what I'm saying?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.176
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And then this guy,

01:18.312 --> 01:19.711
His big, long sword--
- for sure!

01:19.847 --> 01:21.045
- We obviously know
what that means.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.381
- Well, yeah, it's the whole...
It's the...

01:22.383 --> 01:23.916
Well, I mean,
look at this, sam. You got...

01:24.051 --> 01:26.318
Look what you got going on
in your little area there.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.653
- What? Oh, my god!
- Yeah.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.586
(distant barking)

01:28.622 --> 01:29.721
- Oh, that always happens

01:29.790 --> 01:32.124
When I have double butter.
These are new jeans.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.926
- Well, not anymore.
That's what you get

01:34.061 --> 01:35.928
For hogging all the popcorn,
and keeping it nestled

01:36.063 --> 01:37.862
All up in that area.
That's what's gonna happen.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.064
- Hey, I was clear
from the start.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.398
I do not share my popcorn.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.668
- That's true, that's true.
You've been very clear always.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.936
- Yeah, I'm an open book.
That's part of my charm.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.205
You know what? Go ahead,
ask me anything.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.539
I dare you. I dare you.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.408
- Really? Okay. No, I got ya.
- Okay.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.743
- Uh, guilty musical pleasure?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.613
- Uh... Easy. Styx.
Come sail away.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.881
- I love that song.
- Really?

01:55.883 --> 01:57.015
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.283
- Classic, you know?
- Yeah.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.552
- Dream date.
- Ooh, I know.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.421
The immersive van gogh exhibit
followed by dinner at canoe.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.557
- Oh. Okay.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.626
Um...

02:07.761 --> 02:09.895
Weirdest place
you've ever had sex.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.165
- Canoe. The boat,
not the restaurant.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.832
- I am sensing a theme here.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.434
- It's a bit of one.
- Okay, fair enough.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.435
(rustling)

02:17.471 --> 02:19.905
Sam, look.
No, no. Look, sam, look.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.839
- What?
- What is that?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.513
(whispering): My mother's
in there by herself.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.048
- Okay, hang on.
Let me get my gun.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.649
(distant barking)

02:35.890 --> 02:36.922
(whispering): Mom!
- Quick!

02:36.991 --> 02:39.091
- Are you okay?
(whispering): Oh, you got...

02:39.093 --> 02:42.460
You got your gun. Oh, my god,
- get down, get down, get down!

02:42.496 --> 02:44.196
- Get him, get him!
- What are you doing?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.632
(naz): This is the police!
And for the record, I am armed!

02:46.634 --> 02:48.333
- I'm also the police
and I am also armed!

02:48.468 --> 02:50.368
- Wait, wait, wait!
Mom, don't shoot!

02:51.138 --> 02:52.638
- Elliot! Oh, my god!

02:52.773 --> 02:54.339
- Jesus!
- What are you doing here?

02:54.474 --> 02:55.774
- Sorry. I didn't have my keys.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.475
I-I just didn't want
to wake you up.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.177
- What, so you break in
through my window?!

02:59.180 --> 03:01.079
- Technically,
it's our window, right?

03:01.081 --> 03:03.181
- Oh, kid, you are so lucky

03:03.217 --> 03:06.952
That this ridiculous socialist
state won't let me carry a gun!

03:06.954 --> 03:08.453
- Ow.
- It's the same socialist state

03:08.489 --> 03:10.489
That pays for your bunionectomy,
just to be clear.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.625
- Judy, you got your operation!
- I did, my love!

03:13.627 --> 03:15.694
(laughter)
- you locked up my condo?

03:15.696 --> 03:18.496
- I almost shot your kid.
- I almost shot my kid.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.798
- She's gonna be dead
before the plant.

03:21.501 --> 03:22.767
Seriously.

03:23.804 --> 03:27.973
♪ I hate myself
for loving you ♪

03:27.975 --> 03:32.310
♪ can't break free
from the things that you do ♪

03:32.379 --> 03:34.779
♪ I wanna walk
but I run back to you ♪

03:34.815 --> 03:36.848
- Len, call me. Asshole!

03:38.152 --> 03:39.918
(hiccupping)
- hey.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.121
We need to get a swear jar
for the office?

03:44.158 --> 03:46.458
- Look at you,
all freshly pressed.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.793
Aren't you the perfect picture
of calm.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.462
- Honestly, I've had
enough adrenaline

03:50.531 --> 03:52.264
Coursing through my finely
tuned machine of a body

03:52.333 --> 03:53.865
After nearly killing my son
last night,

03:53.934 --> 03:56.167
But thank you so much
for the compliment.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.471
Hey.
(phone ringing)

03:59.540 --> 04:01.406
You haven't heard anything
from len yet?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.475
- Nope. Two days, nothing.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.176
And until we get those 3d guns,

04:05.178 --> 04:08.213
Richie clarke stays in jail
for shooting a cop. And...

04:08.215 --> 04:10.015
I still don't think
he did it.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.582
- You've been to see richie?

04:11.619 --> 04:13.418
- I tried, but he didn't
want to talk to me.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.754
And why would he? So far,
I have no good news

04:15.823 --> 04:17.289
That'll make him
change his mind.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.360
(hiccupping)
- duff, I need to talk
about the hiccups.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.561
They are a sign of stress.
What you can do--

04:27.635 --> 04:29.367
Hello. Good morning, uh, boss.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.969
- Do not "good morning" me,
detective.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.172
Not unless you've magically
discovered $20,000

04:34.174 --> 04:35.507
And 10 3d guns in your purse!

04:35.509 --> 04:38.343
- Sadly, we have not.
- Duff, get up.

04:38.478 --> 04:39.644
Thanks to you,

04:39.713 --> 04:42.180
Our one lead on the gun
that shot officer beauchamp

04:42.216 --> 04:44.983
Is drifting in the wind
with a rogue agent.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.452
Along with all the evidence
in the case and our flash fund!

04:47.587 --> 04:49.388
- You know what? Kevin looks
really upset, so you might

04:49.523 --> 04:50.988
Want to take it down a notch.
- Ahem!

04:51.025 --> 04:54.092
Find grierson,
bring him in from the cold,

04:54.227 --> 04:56.394
Save this case, save your ass.
(phone vibrating)

04:56.463 --> 04:58.530
Asses. Plural. Both your asses.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.999
So many asses. Hello?

05:03.603 --> 05:04.469
(knocking)

05:04.471 --> 05:06.337
Wazowski, duff, follow me!
- Yep.

05:06.373 --> 05:10.776
- Oh, jesus, mary and joseph.
Look what the cat dragged in.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.412
- What a cute...
That is a dog, right?

05:14.681 --> 05:17.482
I'm len's handler,
sergeant melissa jordan, rcmp.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.217
But you call me mel, or liss--

05:19.286 --> 05:21.886
- I'm not calling you anything
until I understand

05:21.922 --> 05:23.288
How you allowed your agent

05:23.357 --> 05:25.623
To abscond with our guns,
our money,

05:25.693 --> 05:27.626
And our one decent lead
in the shooting

05:27.761 --> 05:29.294
Of a police officer.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.497
- Leonard, you wanna take this?
- Certainly.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.766
I agreed to help out
detectives duff and wazowski

05:34.768 --> 05:36.501
On their gun buy,
but two minutes in,

05:36.537 --> 05:40.304
I saw my target, marc tremblay,
in a car 30 feet away.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.641
Guy followed me.
He's paranoid.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.509
- He's a biker.
Comes with the territory.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.712
(hiccupping)
- so I threw the deal.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.380
Two months in on this play,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.581
I'm almost in with
these sons of jupiter guys,

05:50.617 --> 05:52.317
No easy feat for a black dude.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.586
I needed to look legit.

05:54.588 --> 05:58.055
- So... You handed over 3d guns
to a biker,

05:58.092 --> 06:00.525
Because that's who you want
going through a metal detector?

06:00.660 --> 06:03.462
- I took out the firing pins.
Guns didn't work.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.997
So I figured he might be running
counter-surveillance on me,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.599
So I laid low for a few days.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.934
- And project voltage?
Why use an old name?

06:09.970 --> 06:12.537
- I told len to use it in case
anyone was asking around.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.606
We want to stay completely
under the radar,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.208
Even within our own ranks.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.643
- And you took off
with our money, why?

06:18.645 --> 06:21.079
- Oh, that was
just to look tough.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.953
It's all there.
You can make your arrest.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.088
- What I really care
about right now is finding

06:31.125 --> 06:33.425
That last piece of evidence
against our shooter.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.360
- Maybe it was marc tremblay.
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.895
I was with him all that night.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.729
- Correct. All night.
I was listening.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.966
- Well, maybe he gave them
or sold them to someone else.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.168
(hiccupping)
- ahem. Hmm.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.276
Did you try
holding your breath yet?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.844
Biting on a lemon?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.779
- Go to hell, len.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.114
- Want me to fix it?
'cause I will.

06:59.386 --> 07:02.320
- This... Is a huge
case for me.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.055
And you offered to help,

07:04.124 --> 07:05.990
And I vouch for you
like a fool!

07:07.260 --> 07:08.393
And then you go and disappear
on me for three days?

07:08.395 --> 07:09.794
You know, all I know about you

07:09.797 --> 07:12.363
Is that your file says
that you were in rehab,

07:12.399 --> 07:14.465
And that... And that
this project voltage

07:14.501 --> 07:16.267
Doesn't even exist.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.269
- I'm sorry.
(hiccupping)

07:19.806 --> 07:21.239
I... I am...

07:22.676 --> 07:24.342
I should've found
a way to call.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.811
- Yeah. So if you're so sorry,

07:26.814 --> 07:28.814
Find out who marc
sold those guns to.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.284
- I'm meeting up with him now.
I'll see what I can do.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.685
- Good.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.587
It's very cool of you...
Detective.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.062
- Hey, duff, are you in here?

07:48.469 --> 07:49.767
Duff?

07:51.571 --> 07:54.171
(singsong):
I know you're in here!

07:54.208 --> 07:56.574
Duff? Duff...?

07:57.478 --> 07:58.376
(hiccupping)

07:58.445 --> 07:59.644
I know. I know you
don't like talking.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.445
I know that. And I know
that you don't like sharing,

08:01.482 --> 08:02.947
I know you find that hard.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.718
Listen.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.119
Um...

08:10.090 --> 08:11.456
I can only imagine

08:11.525 --> 08:13.992
How weird it is to see len
after all this time.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.595
It's like all the little things
that you know about him,

08:16.730 --> 08:18.997
And all the secrets
that he knows about you.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.899
I bet you guys even have, like,
nicknames for each other,

08:21.034 --> 08:22.400
Like "len the hen" or...

08:22.469 --> 08:24.269
I mean, not that he's
like a chicken.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.670
That one's not right,
I'm so sorry.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.539
But, like, maybe an album.
Like, do you guys got an album

08:27.674 --> 08:28.673
Or a song?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.708
For me, I cannot hear maroon 5's

08:30.710 --> 08:32.877
She will be loved
without thinking about steve.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.012
We were at this criminology
conference in thunder bay,

08:35.148 --> 08:36.848
And then the power went out.
And he was like,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.350
"where's the fuse box?"
I was like, "oh, who cares

08:38.485 --> 08:39.951
About the fuse box?
Look at you in those jeans."

08:40.086 --> 08:41.720
I didn't say that,
but I wish I did, 'cause--

08:41.722 --> 08:43.355
- Really? Maroon 5?

08:43.490 --> 08:44.956
- I know, it's terrible.
But you know what?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.225
Sometimes a song picks you,
you don't pick the song.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.695
- I'm having a really...
Really bad day.

08:51.698 --> 08:55.233
And it's not about boys.
It's about a boy.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.969
- I know.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.373
It's about richard clarke.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.043
Listen.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.114
I promise you. Duff...

09:11.718 --> 09:13.785
I promise we're gonna get there.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.254
- You know... In this job,

09:16.389 --> 09:19.023
You shouldn't make promises,
wazowski.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.663
(siren wailing)

09:26.366 --> 09:28.399
Hey, can I get those, uh,

09:28.435 --> 09:30.402
Richie clarke notes
that you have?

09:30.537 --> 09:33.271
I just want to go over
his files again tonight.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.407
- Yeah, for sure. But, listen.
You know what?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.075
I really think that you need
to take the night off.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.743
Yeah? No, look at me,
look at me.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.479
Beer, bath foam, bed? Come on.
(hiccupping)

09:41.515 --> 09:42.880
Do this for me. Open your mouth,

09:42.882 --> 09:44.282
Pull your tongue out.
Pull it hard.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.084
Give it a try.
- I'm not gonna--

09:46.153 --> 09:48.887
- Just try.
What do you got to lose? Go.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.488
Just do what I say for once.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.090
- Okay.
- There you go.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.326
- Ow. It hurts, though.
(indistinct chattering)

09:56.530 --> 09:57.962
- I come in peace.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.839
Marc tremblay's satellite phone.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.607
He was in my car,
his buzzer was on the dash,

10:09.742 --> 10:11.042
I grabbed it for you.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.845
He thinks he lost it,
he's... Freaking out.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.346
You got three days with it

10:15.349 --> 10:17.448
Before I need
to "find" it for him.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.518
Deal?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.421
- Deal.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.290
- The tongue thing
was pretty cute.

10:30.096 --> 10:32.129
(engine starting, len chuckling)

10:33.733 --> 10:35.133
You're welcome.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.404
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god,

10:39.473 --> 10:41.372
That is marc the shark's
sat phone. Give it here.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.940
I mean please, can I have it?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.309
- Okay, no, stand down.
This is my intel.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.746
- Take the night off and just
let me take it home tonight.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.547
I'm gonna be up late anyway.
I'm having lobster.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.815
I can't sleep on seafood.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.751
It's just a thing. Come on.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.552
Okay, listen.
Come over after dinner,

10:54.554 --> 10:55.487
We can crack it together.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.823
- Pass. But if you find
anything, call me.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.092
- Pinky swear. I promise.
So many promises.

11:01.227 --> 11:02.961
Look at me. Yes!

11:03.096 --> 11:05.029
Up top. Yeah.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.364
- Call me.
- Poof!

11:07.401 --> 11:09.701
By myself. Yes!

11:09.836 --> 11:11.736
(gulls squawking)

11:13.406 --> 11:17.709
- Samantha, can you please
tell me the need for gloves?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.977
If the food isn't safe
for your hands,

11:20.047 --> 11:22.580
How is it safe inside your body?

11:22.649 --> 11:24.449
- It is a mystery.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.717
An even bigger mystery

11:25.786 --> 11:27.384
Is when did you guys
leave florida and why?

11:27.421 --> 11:29.053
I thought you liked it there.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.788
- Yeah, we did.
- We liked it a lot.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.924
Um, I think
we just kind of started--

11:32.993 --> 11:34.993
- It was, like,
we were getting homesick.
- ...Getting homesick.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.328
And we just wanted to, like,
I dunno, take a road trip.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.630
- Road trip. Nice one, my dude.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.664
Nothing like cranking the tunes
on the open road.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.634
- Oh, god.
- Life is a highway!

11:42.769 --> 11:44.268
- Highway!
- Okay...

11:44.337 --> 11:45.903
- No, no, you don't
have to do that.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.972
- Sing the whole song?
- No, you can probably stop.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.241
- Yeah, well, uh...
Here's another mystery.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.876
Why were you with
that detective last night?

11:52.011 --> 11:55.213
- Oh, well, that's, um...

11:55.282 --> 11:57.182
Really, it's because...

11:57.184 --> 11:59.484
Because we were working
on a case, a big case,

11:59.619 --> 12:02.353
And there's just no rest...
Just no rest for the wicked.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.688
- Ha! Samantha, please.
- Please don't.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.924
- You overshare
about everything.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.591
Why not tell the kid the truth?

12:07.627 --> 12:09.860
- Okay. Detective nazeer
and I...

12:10.897 --> 12:12.496
...Have been going
to the occasional movie.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.200
- Oh, that's a nice euphemism.
Caught them the other night...

12:15.335 --> 12:17.301
- Please don't.
- ...With their pants down,

12:17.337 --> 12:19.103
Literally!
- Oh, my god.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.372
That's not... That's okay.
She just came in,

12:21.441 --> 12:23.575
And that's her interpretation
of it.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.310
- No, I love that!
I love it when older women

12:25.445 --> 12:26.511
Explore their sexuality.
- Ah!

12:26.646 --> 12:27.945
- That's dope!
- Great.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.581
Okay, that made it...
That made it worse.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.883
- Older is right!
You should see this kid,

12:31.952 --> 12:34.319
She's shtupping!
It's ridiculous!

12:34.454 --> 12:36.554
- Judy, judy, leave her alone.
(judy laughing)

12:36.590 --> 12:38.522
- What?
- Leave her alone.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.258
(judy laughing)

12:41.294 --> 12:43.928
I think we need a nightcap.
That's what I think.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.530
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

12:45.532 --> 12:48.465
- Sweet ride.
Neighbourhood's looking up.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.668
- Okay. Mom?
- Yeah.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.003
- I really think
you should get a cane, okay?

12:53.039 --> 12:54.738
- I do not need a cane.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.342
- Judy, you'd rock a cane.
(judy laughing)

12:57.477 --> 12:59.410
(laughter)
- yeah...

12:59.446 --> 13:03.014
I have to admit
that food was delicious.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.817
Samantha, I'm so sorry
I ever doubted you.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.218
(laughing)

13:07.254 --> 13:09.420
Grappa, anyone?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.021
- Are you sure, mom?
Drinking on meds?

13:11.057 --> 13:12.423
You're not ready for bed?

13:12.425 --> 13:15.126
- Oh, please. I'm having fun.
- Sure.

13:15.261 --> 13:18.029
I'll take a grappa.

For a long night
of lobster nightmares.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.376
- Lobsters don't give you
nightmares.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.778
That's patently ridiculous.
- Well, they do to her.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.315
Lobsters and nacho cheese
have her climbing the walls.

such a paranoid soul?

There will be hell to pay.

(siren blipping)

14:37.477 --> 14:40.077
(indistinct chattering)

14:42.649 --> 14:45.249
- Okay, people,
we're here from b&e.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.185
We will be taking this over.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.453
- Uh, two, uh,
break-ins in a row.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.256
That's gotta be some kind
of a record. You okay?

14:52.325 --> 14:54.592
- Yeah, I-I'm fine.
- Hey.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.060
- Hey.
- I just heard.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.062
I just figured you could use
some moral support,

14:58.064 --> 15:00.331
Especially with those two bozos
running things.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.802
- It's nice. It's, uh, serene.
- Thanks.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.937
- Wait.
You haven't been in here yet?

15:06.939 --> 15:09.807
- Uh, have you? Has he?
No, I don't think that he...

15:09.809 --> 15:12.043
Can we just stop?
We need to focus up here, okay?

15:12.178 --> 15:14.879
So we're not... Uh...
(nazeer sighing)

15:14.881 --> 15:16.614
Oh, well... Okay, great.
Look at this.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.848
All... All my jewellery's gone.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.351
- Oh, I've seen your jewellery.
I think you'll live.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.953
- Anything else
of value in here?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.254
- No! That's nothing in there!

15:23.389 --> 15:25.756
- Found something. They were
in the basement near the window.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.759
- Oh, god.
- Maybe the subject
dropped them.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.594
I'm gonna get them printed now.
- I think it's fine.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.728
You don't have to do that.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.697
- So, what, your kid smokes?
- No. God, no.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.499
- Then I'll go get them printed.
- Okay, okay, f-fine.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.904
- What?
- Uh...

15:39.973 --> 15:43.007
Uh... They're mine,
they're mine.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.709
- You smoke?
- Not usually.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.444
That's not something that I do.
It's just that I'm very

15:46.446 --> 15:48.046
Stressed out at the minute,
'cause my mother came over,

15:48.181 --> 15:50.415
There's stuff going on, I found
myself in a shorty's variety,

15:50.417 --> 15:51.949
I was, like: Oh, my god...
Oh, sam!

15:51.985 --> 15:53.785
And then I bought
some cigarettes.
And that's just what happened.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.852
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.187
- I'll go tell 'em.
- That's great.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.388
Thank you very much.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.590
- What the hell?!

15:59.726 --> 16:01.125
- Oh, my god, no!

16:01.127 --> 16:03.261
- Kelly marie duff.
Do not like that picture of me.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.863
- Please don't.
- "tough duff. Duff-initely.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.999
The duffinator."
- oh, my god, no. No!

16:08.068 --> 16:09.300
- Oh! Taai nazeer
gets three hearts!

16:09.435 --> 16:11.736
- No! My god, no! No!
- That's so cute!

16:11.738 --> 16:13.270
Oh, the shipper name
is snazzy naz--

16:13.306 --> 16:15.072
- Okay, no! Please don't.
- What is this?

16:15.141 --> 16:17.208
Like, a five-point plan
for making friends?

16:17.343 --> 16:20.011
- No, it is not, okay?
It is not that. It's, uh, a...

16:20.013 --> 16:21.812
It's a vision board
for people that I like,

16:21.848 --> 16:23.748
And you should probably
take it as a compliment.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.283
- Oh, so it's like a ocd thing.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.618
- Listen, I have never
officially been diagnosed
with ocd,

16:27.620 --> 16:30.020
But it has crossed my mind.

16:30.022 --> 16:33.891
- That was hilarious.
- Please. Listen to me.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.694
- Oh.
- Please do not tell my mother.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.229
- That what?
Her bracelet was stolen?

16:38.364 --> 16:40.765
- Oh, no, you can tell her
about that. Just don't tell
her about--

16:40.767 --> 16:42.700
- The smoking? Honestly,
I'm pretty impressed

16:42.835 --> 16:44.302
That you still have any secrets.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.970
- Please, duff--
- actually,

16:46.105 --> 16:47.771
I prefer the duffinator.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.574
- Oh, my god.
- Someone broke into the house.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.110
- Did they take anything?

16:53.146 --> 16:55.379
- We don't know yet.
- Mom, are you okay?

16:55.381 --> 16:57.682
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Well, the good thing is

16:57.684 --> 16:59.316
There really wasn't
much to take.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.119
Not even a low-level thief
would take that stereo.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.454
- Uh, okay, thank you.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.989
Whoever it was took
all of my jewellery,

17:05.124 --> 17:06.891
And all
of my mother's jewellery.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.193
- Okay, well, that's something,
I suppose.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.195
Son, we're gonna have
to make sure

17:11.197 --> 17:13.230
Nothing of yours is missing.
Let's go.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.400
- And just confirming
the gun box

17:16.403 --> 17:17.502
Is still in the closet?

17:17.637 --> 17:20.271
You got your cellphone,
wallet, laptop?

17:20.273 --> 17:21.506
- Yeah, cell, wallet, tech.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.574
And the laptop's
in the ergosack 3000.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.977
It's a computer bag.
It's on the table.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.014
- Yeah, nothing in here.
- Yes, it is.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.149
- Nope.
- Yes, it is.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.886
It was in here. It...
It was in here before I left.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.255
- Was that police laptop,
or personal?

17:40.326 --> 17:42.360
- Police.
(chuckling)

17:42.495 --> 17:44.695
- It's alright.
I'm calling tech right now.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.030
I'll get them
to shut it down remotely.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.301
- Sam, marc tremblay's phone
that was in that bag,

17:50.436 --> 17:52.303
You put it upstairs
or in some little hidey-hole

17:52.372 --> 17:53.771
Of yours, put it
in a safe maybe?

17:53.840 --> 17:54.972
- No.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.175
No, it was in the bag,
it was in the bag.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.577
And now it's gone.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.422
- Hey, no, it's okay. It's fine.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.724
We just gotta focus. Alright,
figure out who broke in--

18:13.793 --> 18:15.593
- And find that phone.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.994
- Oh, god, duff. Why?

18:17.063 --> 18:18.262
Why'd you let me
take that phone home?

18:18.397 --> 18:20.063
(hiccupping)
- that is what I would
like to know.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.599
That phone should've been
kept here.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.435
How do we know
that its owner didn't track it?

18:24.570 --> 18:26.336
- Because I checked before
dinner. The phone was dead.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.673
No one can track it.
- Can they, though? Or can we?

18:28.808 --> 18:30.541
Is there any way
we can follow that phone?

18:30.676 --> 18:31.809
- Not unless someone uses it.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.978
- Great. So now we're back
to looking for a random burglar.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.313
- You two aren't looking
for anyone.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.149
Someone took a criminal's phone
and a cop's laptop

18:39.151 --> 18:40.384
From this one's house.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.086
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

18:42.088 --> 18:43.954
But I think
mcconnell and davidson

18:43.990 --> 18:46.424
Are gonna have to take
the lead on this one.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.959
- I think I might have an idea.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.028
- Elliot,
what are you doing here?

18:52.599 --> 18:56.501
(buzzing, sniffing)
- detectives,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.469
<i> Let me be clear.</i>
<i>My clients are here voluntarily,</i>

18:58.604 --> 19:00.671
<i> On the understanding</i>
<i> that anything they do say</i>

19:00.740 --> 19:03.274
<i> Will not be used against them.</i>
<i> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. We know.</i>

19:03.276 --> 19:05.042
<i> - So, elliot,</i>

19:05.044 --> 19:07.244
What's your theory here? Hmm?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.013
- My theory is that I...

19:09.148 --> 19:12.783
May have left the united states
with something that...

19:12.785 --> 19:16.587
Someone may have thought
was theirs, and, um...

19:19.025 --> 19:21.192
...They may have
come looking for it.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.728
<i> - Okay, so you ripped</i>
<i> someone off,</i>

19:23.730 --> 19:25.029
<i> They came back at you.</i>

19:25.164 --> 19:27.532
<i> It's a classic thug circle</i>
<i> of life, am I right?</i>

19:27.667 --> 19:29.733
<i> Ms. Sullivan,</i>
<i> I understand your mom</i>

19:29.735 --> 19:32.603
Is a drug kingpin
currently in prison?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.472
- I'm not sure what
ms. Sullivan's mother has to do

19:34.607 --> 19:37.341
With last night's burglary.
- Karma. Speaks to character.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.043
- Karma. Good one.
- Thank you.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.879
- Either way, what do you think
they may have been looking for
here, son?

19:43.049 --> 19:45.883
<i> - Uh-oh. What do we have here?</i>
<i> (chuckling)</i>

19:46.018 --> 19:47.685
<i> (whistling)</i>
<i> there it is.</i>

19:47.820 --> 19:49.486
<i> - Jackpot.</i>

19:49.488 --> 19:52.022
<i> Now, tell me.</i>
<i> How did you earn this?</i>

19:52.892 --> 19:53.858
<i> - Does it matter?</i>

19:53.993 --> 19:55.492
<i> - Well, it does</i>
<i> if it's retribution.</i>

19:55.528 --> 19:57.361
<i> What were you two</i>
<i> into down there, huh?</i>

19:57.496 --> 20:00.897
Drugs? Prostitution?
Human trafficking?

20:00.934 --> 20:02.333
- Okay, that's enough.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.768
<i> - You guys pimps? Or maybe...</i>

20:04.804 --> 20:07.505
- Boss.
- Okay, fine.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.973
I'll find somebody else
to do it,

20:09.108 --> 20:10.708
But you two, out. Just leave.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.643
<i> (steve): Okay,</i>
<i> this is clearly harassment.</i>

20:12.778 --> 20:15.412
<i> Sexual harassment, in fact.</i>
<i>- Asking questions, that's all.</i>

20:15.448 --> 20:16.681
<i> - No, you're not just asking</i>
<i> questions anymore.</i>

20:16.816 --> 20:19.916
<i> Thank you, detectives.</i>
<i> We will speak to the adults.</i>

20:19.953 --> 20:21.952
<i> - We're just talking.</i>
(sighing)

20:28.094 --> 20:31.194
(hiccupping)
- you know, it's so weird

20:31.231 --> 20:33.297
How you can be
so angry at someone

20:33.333 --> 20:35.332
And then have the urge
to protect them

20:35.368 --> 20:36.734
At the exact same time.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.368
- Mm-hmm.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.772
- What?

20:43.209 --> 20:44.675
Go ahead.
You want to say something?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.477
- How many times
do you want to see your son

20:46.546 --> 20:48.746
Behind that window before
you actually do something?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.414
(phone vibrating)
'cause you know, if that

20:50.483 --> 20:52.516
Had been any other kid...

20:54.186 --> 20:56.153
Hey, what's up, len?

20:56.155 --> 20:57.988
<i> - Any luck opening that gift?</i>

20:59.259 --> 21:01.158
- Um, no,
we're still working on it.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.427
<i> - Cool. I'm seeing marc</i>
<i> day after tomorrow.</i>

21:03.562 --> 21:05.195
<i> As long as I get back by then.</i>

21:05.265 --> 21:07.130
- Yeah, sure. You got it.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.572
Straight.

21:15.642 --> 21:19.110
So, you left toronto
with a bagful of mdma,

21:19.245 --> 21:21.845
And started selling it
in a club in miami.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.848
- Yeah, but we just wanted
to get rid of it,

21:23.850 --> 21:25.449
Make some money and start fresh.

21:25.584 --> 21:28.152
And I told the club owner
that I'd cut a deal with him,

21:28.154 --> 21:29.619
But then we took
all the money and left

21:29.656 --> 21:30.554
In the middle of the night.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.189
- The guy was harassing
his staff.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.724
He was assaulting women,

21:33.859 --> 21:36.226
Date-rape drugs, the whole deal.
And then, one night,

21:36.296 --> 21:37.862
He went after one of my friends,

21:37.997 --> 21:41.698
So I just told elliot
that we had to leave that night.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.470
- Okay, this club owner,
does he know anyone up here?

21:46.605 --> 21:48.005
Does he have any
toronto connections?

21:48.007 --> 21:49.073
- Not that I know of.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.175
- Yeah, but he might
know people everywhere.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.413
- Well, good news is,
doesn't look like

21:56.449 --> 21:57.981
You were targeted as a cop.

21:58.051 --> 22:01.819
Bad news is,
your son was selling mdma

22:01.821 --> 22:04.155
Out of crimson castle.
It's a club in miami.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.558
He also ripped off the owner.
Guy's name is vince choudry.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.627
- Does vince choudry have
any connections up here?

22:10.629 --> 22:13.364
- Yeah. Brio del marco,
32 years old.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.765
Works security
over at wavelength.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.333
It's a club over on islington.

22:16.468 --> 22:18.369
He and vince were cellmates
in 2016.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.770
Still in contact over social.

22:19.905 --> 22:22.740
But they're like teenage girls.
It's all shorthand and emojis.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.374
- Go back.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.843
Go back, go back, go back.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.446
That car, last night
after dinner,

22:29.482 --> 22:31.048
That was parked
outside my house.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.185
- Okay. Well, we will keep
uniforms at your house,

22:35.254 --> 22:37.121
Put a team on this brio guy now

22:37.123 --> 22:39.389
And pick him up
soon as we find him.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.957
(hiccupping)

22:41.994 --> 22:43.527
(hiccupping)

22:46.532 --> 22:48.065
- Hey, sam.
- Hey.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.000
- You alright?
- Yeah.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.335
- Can I do anything for ya?
- No, I'm good.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.039
- Come on. You sure?

22:56.109 --> 22:59.109
- Yeah. Have a good... Day.

23:09.688 --> 23:12.022
- Hey, will you let me
just talk to you for one--

23:12.058 --> 23:14.357
- No, you can't. No more words.
I want you guys to go inside.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.493
I want you to make coffee
for pj and rachel.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.295
(both): Who?
- Pj and rachel. Over there.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.097
See them?
Those two cops over there

23:20.232 --> 23:21.832
Sitting around like assholes
guarding us,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.034
Because yet again,
you have endangered our lives.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.702
Listen. You know I love you.

23:25.704 --> 23:27.771
Pj, you know I love you.
I don't think you're an asshole.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.173
- Yeah, no, I know. It's...

23:29.175 --> 23:31.041
- It's fine. Do you want milk?
You want sugar?

23:31.043 --> 23:33.611
- Uh, do you have oat?
- Are you kidding?
Yep, I definitely--

23:33.613 --> 23:36.046
- If it's not a problem.
- Not a problem at all.
Be right there.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.516
Okay, need you to get
the oat milk in the small
cupboard near the dryer

23:38.651 --> 23:40.116
With that cane sugar
we never use. Doesn't matter,

23:40.153 --> 23:41.652
Go in and get it.
- Okay.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.287
(sighing)

23:48.961 --> 23:50.661
- Hell of a day.
- Yeah.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.731
- Sam, it's fine.
I know you want it.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.673
Better?
- Better. Be better
if I had a light.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.174
You got a light?
'course you don't.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.477
Know what'd be better?
If I had a light,
then I could light it,

24:06.612 --> 24:09.179
Then I would be one step
closer to death. That would
actually really be better.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.348
- Sam...
- Our son's a criminal.
Do you actually get that?

24:11.484 --> 24:13.684
Because I do.
'cause I'm a terrible mother.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.952
I'm really pathetic.
And the one goddamn time

24:15.988 --> 24:18.455
I let my guard down,
I lose key evidence in a case,

24:18.524 --> 24:20.423
And all my colleagues,
they just...

24:22.561 --> 24:24.962
...They just tromped
all through my house.

24:25.031 --> 24:29.500
And then they saw...
My stupid, stupid...

24:31.938 --> 24:33.804
It's so stupid.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.305
I'm so stupid.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.174
- You're, you're not...
- No, no, stop it. Stop.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.477
My stupid personal crappy life.
They saw my friend board.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.048
You know how hard it is
for me to make friends.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.650
- I don't know.
They all seem to like you.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.151
(sniffling)

24:48.221 --> 24:50.220
Especially that nazeer fellow.
- Yeah, not anymore.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.089
Not after he finds out
I'm a secret smoker

24:52.158 --> 24:53.190
And, like, a lying
piece of crap.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.458
- Sam, you're human.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.295
You're adorably human.

24:59.332 --> 25:01.565
And that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.303
Hey.
- Yeah, whatever.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.873
Says mr. Perfect.
- Oh, yeah, I'm really perfect.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.208
I've got a son
who's always in jail.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.943
- Really? Me, too.
I highly recommend

25:13.012 --> 25:14.545
Not putting it on
your dating profile.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.746
It's a serious red flag.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.147
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.682
- You really think
this was just elliot?

25:18.817 --> 25:20.551
Selling drugs?
Ripping people off?

25:20.620 --> 25:22.819
- No, I don't.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.155
I think it was jackie,
but I'll tell you what.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.392
If elliot wants to take
the blame... That's on him.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.894
But I want that girl
out of my house.

25:30.963 --> 25:34.064
I kind of wish he...
I just wish he'd never met her.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.032
- Elliot's gonna be fine.
- Hey.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.702
You want me to take this?
- Yeah, sure.

25:38.771 --> 25:42.973
Um... Hey, you know
that you don't gotta do this.

25:44.310 --> 25:47.243
Right? You know, this was
my problem and my hustle.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.779
- Hey, your hustle is my hustle.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.748
It's... It's not like
I didn't know anyways.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.984
- You've got all of these...

25:55.387 --> 25:58.789
...People who care about you
and want to see you succeed--

25:58.791 --> 26:00.757
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.
You just...

26:00.826 --> 26:03.093
Gotta trust me
a little bit, okay?

26:03.129 --> 26:04.761
(soft music)

26:11.437 --> 26:13.804
Io
since last night.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.240
He hasn't gone anywhere,
not even to the club.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.242
- Anyone find the sat phone?
Turned it on?

26:19.278 --> 26:20.744
Is there another way
to track it?

26:20.879 --> 26:22.713
- Not yet. I think
this brio guy's operating

26:22.848 --> 26:25.749
On the dark web,
and it's all private rooms.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.918
We need a code or an intro.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.087
- Can't y'all just dm him
or something?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.890
- No, this guy's for real.
He's not gonna bite over social.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.693
But we do need your help
making contact with him.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.294
Maybe call vince in miami,
get an introduction?

26:39.532 --> 26:41.464
- Jackie...
(sighing)

26:42.134 --> 26:43.800
(line ringing)

26:45.638 --> 26:47.905
- Hey. Vince?

26:47.907 --> 26:50.774
<i> - ¿qué bola?</i>
- Hey. Yeah, this is, um...

26:50.776 --> 26:52.509
This is melody's friend.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.178
<i> - Yeah, I don't know you.</i>

26:54.180 --> 26:56.613
(jackie laughing)
- yeah, you do.

26:56.649 --> 27:01.452
Look, I want your bro
from the six off of my ass.

27:02.355 --> 27:03.854
Okay? You're pissed at me now.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.589
Just wait and see how pissed
you're gonna be

27:05.724 --> 27:08.192
When I call the cops
on your little ghb

27:08.327 --> 27:10.994
Seduction ring, because, dude,

27:10.997 --> 27:12.596
I got it all on video.

27:12.598 --> 27:15.566
Kids these days,
always recording things.

27:15.568 --> 27:18.736
So if you want your cut,
I want you to link me with brio.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.671
I meet him later today,
you bring my laptop

27:20.740 --> 27:23.140
And my buzzer, you can get
your cut of the money,

27:23.142 --> 27:25.608
And we won't go to the police.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.444
<i> - I gotta go.</i>

27:27.446 --> 27:29.279
- You have a video

27:29.348 --> 27:30.547
Of this vince guy
committing a crime?

27:30.583 --> 27:32.782
- No, but how's
he gonna know that?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.785
(phone chiming)
here you go.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.089
- Oh, okay. Uh...

27:41.527 --> 27:43.026
(beeping)
we're in.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.762
- Nice.
(nathan chuckling)

27:44.897 --> 27:46.362
- That's not how I'd start that.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.839
Should I give him my name?

27:55.841 --> 27:57.908
- Nah, he knows your name.
Let's try--

27:57.977 --> 28:01.412
- Laptop plus satellite
plus phone equals bag of money.

28:06.285 --> 28:09.052
(chiming)
- no... No prince, no dice?

28:09.088 --> 28:10.988
- Oh, yeah, he's trying to say

28:11.123 --> 28:13.389
That he wants to hear
from vince first.

28:13.426 --> 28:15.659
"prince" vince.
He's the owner of the...

28:15.728 --> 28:18.261
Crimson castle.
It's a power play, essentially.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.197
He, uh... He's doing this
for vince.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.233
He wants him to be in the know.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.937
Where do you guys want
this meet to be?

28:27.072 --> 28:29.206
- How about the van gogh
exhibit?

28:29.208 --> 28:32.075
Wh... No, 'cause I was...
I was looking it up online.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.044
It's big, it's dark,
it's contained.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.546
We could hide
our people there easily.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.047
- Sounds like fun to me.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.316
Best part is, he doesn't seem
to know you're a cop,

28:39.318 --> 28:41.184
Which bodes well
for getting the sat phone back.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.822
- Ugh. That's not
how you spell van gogh.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.824
(chiming)

28:46.826 --> 28:48.291
- We're on.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.228
(kelly): We good?
Everything in place?

28:51.363 --> 28:52.963
- Yep. All systems go.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.032
You ready?
We're ten minutes out.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.501
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Money's in the bag.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.837
You make contact with brio,
get the laptop

28:59.972 --> 29:01.905
And the satellite phone,
you give him the bag.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.975
- And leave the rest to us,
okay? Alright, turn around.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.113
(hiccupping, chuckling)

29:09.248 --> 29:11.181
- You ever try drinking
through a paper towel?

29:11.316 --> 29:12.716
- Yes. Can you move
your hair, please?

29:12.718 --> 29:14.251
- Oh, yeah.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.819
- Alright.
- Jesus.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.723
It's funny. I'm actually
kinda starting to like
this little thing.

29:19.725 --> 29:22.258
- Yeah, well, you should start
needing it less.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.194
- Excuse me?
- Jackie,

29:24.196 --> 29:25.996
Kids from your neighbourhood
don't get a second chance,

29:26.065 --> 29:28.131
So let's be real clear.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.533
You're getting this pass

29:29.602 --> 29:31.668
'cause of elliot,
so don't screw it up.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.442
(soft classical music,
indistinct chattering)

29:41.547 --> 29:43.947
- Um... You know what?

29:44.082 --> 29:46.115
I think I'm just gonna go
to the washroom really quickly.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.417
- What?
- No, I have to pee.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.818
- Right now?
- It'll take, like, two seconds.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.287
It's fine.
- Are you kidding me?

29:51.323 --> 29:52.756
- I love you.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.799
- What...?

30:27.259 --> 30:30.460
- Yeah, elliot's here. There's--
no, there's no sign of jackie.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.864
- Whoa. My god.
- Well, any sign of brio?

30:33.999 --> 30:35.666
- Hey, look, look.
- What? What?

30:35.801 --> 30:37.033
- Look.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.606
- Why would someone
this magnificent

30:42.741 --> 30:43.674
Cut off his own ear?

30:43.676 --> 30:46.175
- Well, we all have
our problems.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.347
I'm bringing you back here
this weekend.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.616
I got reservations at canoe.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.752
If that's alright.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.891
Hey, sam.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.695
I have a single bed...

31:05.731 --> 31:07.964
(chuckling)
...In my apartment.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.368
Angie took off with the queen,
I never bothered to replace it.

31:11.437 --> 31:14.037
That's why I haven't
invited you over.

31:14.172 --> 31:16.707
'cause it's awful, and, um...

31:17.643 --> 31:19.208
...I'm embarrassed.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.979
Look. We all have our stuff.
Okay?

31:23.115 --> 31:24.381
Single-bed guy, secret smoker.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.717
But maybe we're a match
made in neurotic heaven.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.385
The exhibit's in town
for a few more months.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.585
<i> (kelly): Sam?</i>
- What?

31:29.622 --> 31:31.321
<i> - Can you check on</i>
<i> elliot and jackie?</i>

31:31.323 --> 31:32.923
- Yeah. I'm gonna check it out.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.459
- Sure.
- We're gonna--

31:36.528 --> 31:37.527
- Yeah.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.128
(pounding music)

31:42.501 --> 31:43.901
(phone chiming)

31:47.873 --> 31:49.940
- Elliot's here. Where's jackie?

31:50.075 --> 31:51.407
It's a quarter past.
What is happening?

31:51.443 --> 31:52.876
- No, they should both
be there by now.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.277
<i> - Our target just walked in.</i>

31:56.181 --> 31:57.780
- No, let's call it. Abort.

31:58.884 --> 32:01.318
- Hey. Prince sent me.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.420
- Who are you?
- Elliot. Jackie bailed.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.889
She had some side hustle
going on.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.224
She didn't even tell me.
The money's in my van, okay?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.026
So let's just this over with,
alright?

32:20.639 --> 32:22.839
- I don't know what's happening.
We're coming to you.

32:25.878 --> 32:28.578
(sniffling)
- you do security, right?

32:29.815 --> 32:32.182
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Yeah, um, vince told me.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.318
But, uh, hey, if you ever have
any work lined up for me,

32:35.321 --> 32:36.653
I'd be all over it.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.293
Come on, man.
I'm not giving you 90k out here.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.902
- Police! Get your hands up.
Step back.

32:51.904 --> 32:54.637
Drop it. Turn around.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.274
- Hands on your head!
Interlock your fingers!

32:58.310 --> 32:59.843
(sighing)

33:01.580 --> 33:02.913
- I got it.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.851
- Elliot.
- Just need a minute, okay?

33:10.456 --> 33:11.755
Fuck.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.991
(sighing)

33:16.895 --> 33:18.394
(sniffling)

33:19.431 --> 33:20.730
Fuck!

33:26.972 --> 33:29.372
- So, you'll call us
when you hear from jackie.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.308
And ideally, she shows up soon
with that money.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.646
- What about elliot here?

33:36.682 --> 33:38.981
- We don't have anything
to charge him with.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.784
And without involving the us,

33:40.786 --> 33:43.653
There's no criminal offence tied
to the possession of that money.

33:44.857 --> 33:47.190
Elliot's free to go.
(elliot sighing)

33:48.527 --> 33:50.026
- Thank you, detective.

33:53.999 --> 33:58.367
<i> (michaels): So you're not</i>
<i> a big fan of cops. I get it.</i>

33:59.538 --> 34:01.538
<i> Is that why you shot her?</i>

34:01.607 --> 34:03.673
- I take it elliot walked.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.341
<i> - Did you know</i>
<i> sergeant beauchamp?</i>

34:05.343 --> 34:07.343
(sighing)
- charmed life, that kid.

34:07.379 --> 34:11.414
- Richie sure could've used
a lawyer dad or, you know,

34:11.483 --> 34:13.550
Half the unit
looking out for him.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.219
- He should be so lucky.
- Mm-hmm.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.656
(sighing)

34:21.760 --> 34:23.293
You think he did it?

34:23.295 --> 34:26.897
- Doesn't matter what I think.
The evidence says what it says.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.299
- Marshall court...

34:30.702 --> 34:34.437
A few years ago, keegan and I
ran that basketball program.

34:34.506 --> 34:38.775
Richie was always the first one
in the gym and the last one out.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.577
- Not on you, alright?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.078
(sighing)

34:43.682 --> 34:46.583
Sometimes, you just
gotta be a cop.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.521
(beeping)

34:51.523 --> 34:53.023
- Got it.
- Yes!

34:53.158 --> 34:55.258
- Marc the shark doesn't
have a lot of friends.

34:55.294 --> 34:57.461
He only called one number
from this phone.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.996
889-something?
Looks like another sat phone.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.399
- So, marc is using his phone
to make gun deals
with one person?

35:02.534 --> 35:04.534
- And this one person
could be gabrielle's shooter?

35:04.669 --> 35:05.801
Anything else?
You got anything else?

35:05.838 --> 35:07.070
- We have a warrant
for this number?

35:07.139 --> 35:08.471
- Yeah.
(hiccupping)

35:08.474 --> 35:10.140
- Hi. Anna? Ds greene.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.642
I'm looking for information
on a satellite-phone number.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.746
Yeah. Sending it to you now.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.849
Write this down?

35:18.984 --> 35:20.550
Gps location.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.418
Yep, latitude:

35:22.454 --> 35:26.222
43.695486.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.157
Longitude:

35:29.828 --> 35:32.963
79.334477.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.831
Amazing, anna. Thank you.

35:36.001 --> 35:38.467
What is it? Okay, thank you.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.974
Derwyn drive, etobicoke.

35:44.109 --> 35:46.243
- Who lives there?
- Searching.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.978
A guy named adam gentle.

35:48.113 --> 35:49.779
- Okay, let's go.
You want to drive?

35:49.781 --> 35:51.448
- Definitely.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.583
(tense music)

35:57.923 --> 35:59.322
(hiccupping)
- you know what?

35:59.457 --> 36:01.691
I can't take it anymore.
Hold on, hold on.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.994
Okay, hiccups.
Two remedies left.

36:03.996 --> 36:07.664
(kelly sighing)
orgasm or a rectal massage.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.266
- Mm... Neither.
(hiccupping)

36:10.335 --> 36:12.536
- Okay, you have had
those hiccups

36:12.671 --> 36:13.803
Since len walked back
into your life.

36:13.805 --> 36:14.938
Are you telling me
that's non-issue?

36:15.007 --> 36:16.706
- No, I'm not.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.877
We were together
for three years.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.279
(scoffing)
the best three years of my life.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.514
But then it went bad
really fast.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.421
Right, we were doing
this uc job,

36:31.423 --> 36:33.689
And we were living together,
and I was part of his cover.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.425
But then he got
way too caught up in it.

36:36.461 --> 36:41.097
Then I realized he was using
and... I didn't know what to do.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.632
- Hey, duff.

36:43.769 --> 36:46.970
On top of all that...
Did he start hitting?

36:46.972 --> 36:51.575
- No. He-he'd shove me around.
Okay? And...

36:52.644 --> 36:53.843
(sighing)

36:53.845 --> 36:56.012
Locked me in a closet.
- He put a gun to your head.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.914
- It was all part of the play,
right? But...

36:58.951 --> 37:01.251
Yeah, it sure did scare
the hell outta me.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.120
What are you doing?
- We're gonna hug now.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.323
- Oh, my god,
I think someone's... Home.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.992
- Oh, okay. God, let's get
a look at our gun buyer.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.660
- Good girl...

37:10.696 --> 37:12.596
Come on, hey.
(indistinct chattering)

37:12.731 --> 37:14.264
There we go. Here we go.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.966
- No, that is not our target.
Are you kidding me?

37:17.035 --> 37:19.269
- Okay, let's not stereotype.
He could very, very scary.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.671
- Poopy. Poopy.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.873
(dog whimpering)
thatta girl.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.941
- See this guy is--
- hang on!

37:25.978 --> 37:27.410
- What?
- The dog is doing his business!

37:27.412 --> 37:28.678
Don't you...
- It's already ringing.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.281
(phone ringing)
- oh, freak. Um...

37:31.416 --> 37:33.283
Oh, gosh.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.219
Uh... How does it work again?

37:37.289 --> 37:39.555
- Oh!
- Ah.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.758
- Oh.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.292
- God, for a guy
who's a gun buyer,

37:43.328 --> 37:45.227
He's not too nimble on the draw.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.429
- Indeed.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.499
I highly doubt he shot anyone,
especially gabrielle.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.568
- Okay, so what does he have
to do with marc the biker?

37:54.439 --> 37:56.706
(distant siren wailing)

38:00.579 --> 38:01.845
- Kelly.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.915
- Oh, god, len.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.417
I see why marc lost his phone
in this mess.

38:10.822 --> 38:13.323
Thanks, by the way.
The phone really helped.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.992
- Of course.
Hey, let me walk you in.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.530
(car alarm chirping,
kelly hiccupping)

38:21.566 --> 38:23.533
Tsk. Kelly marie duff.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.668
- What?
- I will give you $100

38:25.737 --> 38:29.138
If you hiccup again.
- Oh, well, get your money out,

38:29.174 --> 38:30.740
'cause it's gonna happen again.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.884
Wow, len. Some things
really haven't changed.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.386
- That's not mine.
- Come on.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.954
- Kelly, it's not mine.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.889
Alright?
Marc gave it to me to sell.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.759
Hey, for real.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.994
I've been sober two years now.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.635
- It's pink.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.505
The same colour we've been
seeing coming out of mexico.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.908
- Take it. Get it tested to see
if it's the same stuff.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.245
- Um, have you heard
who adam gentle is?

39:10.449 --> 39:13.249
An accountant. Real nerd.
Lives on derwyn drive.

39:13.285 --> 39:16.386
- No. Is that
who marc's been calling?

39:17.789 --> 39:20.723
- Yeah, but I still can't find
out what the connection is.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.593
Accountants, bikers,
3d guns, mexico.

39:23.595 --> 39:26.328
I have no clue what is going on.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.097
- Want to walk it through
together?

39:29.401 --> 39:30.800
(sighing)

39:30.869 --> 39:33.602
Ah, yes. Nah, it's cool.
Let's leave it.

39:33.638 --> 39:36.005
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.809
- At least I took care
of those hiccups.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.077
Oh.
(laughing)

39:45.117 --> 39:47.516
- Uh, hey.
Do you still eat pizza?

39:48.653 --> 39:50.353
Or are you one of those
gluten-free nerds now?

39:50.488 --> 39:52.689
- Oh, hell, no.
(car horn honking)

39:52.824 --> 39:55.692
- I mean, I figure we could
go to guarducci's on 3rd,

39:55.827 --> 39:57.226
Talk it out.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.262
- After you.

40:04.903 --> 40:08.037
- So, okay, this is what
I figured out so far.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.307
It's three main gangs
that are in this.

40:11.376 --> 40:12.975
We've got sons of jupiter...

40:33.264 --> 40:36.131
- Did you... Get what you needed
outta that phone, or...?

40:38.370 --> 40:42.405
I'm sorry... It's pretty good
we got it back, though. Right?

40:43.775 --> 40:45.875
It's, like, better than some
random criminal having it--

40:45.944 --> 40:47.409
- You know what would've
been better?

40:47.446 --> 40:49.145
Not having had it stolen
in the first place,

40:49.214 --> 40:50.846
As retribution
for you dealing drugs.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.248
That, elliot,

40:52.250 --> 40:53.750
That would've been better.

40:55.821 --> 40:59.588
- I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm really sorry.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.394
Can I make you dinner
or something? Or...

41:04.396 --> 41:05.528
Like, run you a bath?

41:05.664 --> 41:08.298
(sam chuckling)
- uh, you could...

41:08.433 --> 41:09.965
Stop dealing drugs.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.368
Get a job. Go to university.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.036
There's really so much
that you could do. Not...

41:14.072 --> 41:16.439
Not really for me,
but for you, elliot.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.641

my head pounds from the sound ♪

41:40.599 --> 41:44.534

- elliot tell you what happened?

42:05.857 --> 42:08.524
- Yeah, he did. He did.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.696
- How do I teach him
about consequences...

42:15.767 --> 42:17.500
...When they never
seem to find him?

42:19.537 --> 42:22.505
- Maybe he never had
a mother who...

42:22.574 --> 42:24.640
Let him land on his ass.

42:30.682 --> 42:32.748
- You got it all figured out,
huh?

42:33.585 --> 42:35.851
- Don't be stupid, samantha.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.154
Nobody has it all figured out.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.262
(judy sighing)

42:48.466 --> 42:49.999
Got another one of those?

43:01.079 --> 43:02.478
Light?

43:04.282 --> 43:05.882
(soft music continues)

43:14.893 --> 43:17.426
Subtitling: Difuze
