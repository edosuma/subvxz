00:35.400 --> 00:37.099
- I think I might need some help.

00:37.201 --> 00:38.301
- Is there anyone here

00:38.402 --> 00:39.802
to help you fill this out?

00:39.902 --> 00:41.542
I can handle it.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.579
- Paging Dr. Geller to the ICU.

00:45.674 --> 00:47.673
Dr. Geller to the ICU.

00:57.014 --> 01:00.453
- Paging Dr.
Reeder, dial extension 47.

01:08.021 --> 01:09.660
Dear Jen,

01:10.757 --> 01:11.757
I'm alone.

01:15.093 --> 01:17.662
I'm sitting in a hospital.

01:17.762 --> 01:20.321
And my arm is in
about six pieces.

01:24.866 --> 01:26.966
This isn't exactly how
I planned to celebrate

01:27.068 --> 01:28.507
the end of the year.

01:34.773 --> 01:36.742
- I just can't seem
to wake up today.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.780
- Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna help.

01:38.876 --> 01:39.905
- I know.

01:41.110 --> 01:43.949
Okay, I gotta get back in there.

01:44.045 --> 01:45.714
These women are
driving me crazy.

01:45.813 --> 01:47.613
If you're not attractive
the rest of the year,

01:47.715 --> 01:50.014
what makes you think you
will be on New Year's Eve?

01:50.116 --> 01:51.045
- A new haircut.

01:51.149 --> 01:54.288
- Exactly. I do hair not magic.

01:55.853 --> 01:57.952
I'm so looking forward
to Pete's party.

01:58.054 --> 01:58.994
- Aw, shit!

01:59.089 --> 02:00.518
- What?

02:00.623 --> 02:02.263
- I have to remember to get
beer for the party tonight.

02:02.358 --> 02:04.657
- Yeah, don't fuck that up.

02:04.759 --> 02:06.658
- So, you want me
to pick you up?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.829
- No, I think just, I'm gonna
go home and take a nap first.

02:09.929 --> 02:10.929
- Yeah?

02:11.030 --> 02:12.199
- But I will see you there.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.228
Thank you so much. I
really needed that.

02:13.332 --> 02:14.202
- All right.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.799
Bye, Pam.

02:17.368 --> 02:19.007
- Oh, fuck.

03:15.105 --> 03:17.544
- Hey, hey. Hold on, I got it.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.647
There you go.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.846
Hey!

03:27.113 --> 03:28.713
Thanks.

03:49.928 --> 03:52.797
- Tell me you're finally
restocking the damn machines, Owen.

03:52.897 --> 03:55.467
- Nick, they will be by
next week. I promise.

03:55.566 --> 03:57.066
- I've heard that before.

04:10.009 --> 04:11.348
- Hey.

04:11.443 --> 04:12.843
- If you knew how I was
feeling about you right now,

04:12.944 --> 04:15.573
you would never have gotten
out of that van of yours.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.178
- You know, I was gonna offer
to help you with those bags,

04:17.279 --> 04:18.690
but forget it.

04:19.482 --> 04:21.582
Just send Adam out.

04:21.684 --> 04:23.213
- Do you have a check for me?

04:23.317 --> 04:24.987
- It's not due till next week.

04:25.552 --> 04:26.922
Do you even need it?

04:27.020 --> 04:28.349
Seems like you're doin' fine.

04:28.454 --> 04:30.724
- We are doing fine but I
expect it just the same.

04:30.823 --> 04:32.862
- Well, you'll
have it next week.

04:36.026 --> 04:39.655
- Adam's spending the night
at his friend Matthew's house.

04:39.762 --> 04:41.131
- Wait!

04:41.229 --> 04:42.429
Hold on, I thought I was supposed
to buy him sneakers today?

04:42.531 --> 04:43.800
- That was yesterday.

04:43.898 --> 04:45.638
Who buys shoes on
New Year's Eve?

04:45.733 --> 04:48.402
- I thought we said today.

04:48.502 --> 04:50.831
- It breaks my heart to
see Adam waiting for you

04:50.936 --> 04:53.635
on the curb and
you not showing up.

04:53.738 --> 04:57.547
You don't do that to
an 11 year-old boy.

04:57.641 --> 04:59.570
- Well, why doesn't
he just wait inside?

04:59.675 --> 05:02.344
- The sun's going down, Owen.

05:02.444 --> 05:05.413
It's time to go find your
friends and get drunk.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.052
- Wait, Cindy.

05:10.649 --> 05:13.018
Pete's party is tonight and I
was supposed to pick up beer.

05:13.117 --> 05:15.017
Is there any way I could...?

05:17.253 --> 05:18.822
I have cash!

05:20.155 --> 05:21.524
Or not.

05:32.864 --> 05:34.163
This really gonna work?

05:34.264 --> 05:36.234
- Trust me. You won't
be disappointed.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.202
- Thanks, Kenny.

05:37.299 --> 05:37.999
Uh huh.

05:38.100 --> 05:38.840
- See you later.

05:38.935 --> 05:39.794
- Hey!

05:44.572 --> 05:46.031
Bye.
- Bye.

05:46.139 --> 05:46.839
- Bye.

05:46.940 --> 05:47.980
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:48.074 --> 05:49.941
- Bye.

05:53.210 --> 05:54.169
Owen.

05:54.277 --> 05:55.617
Hey.

05:55.712 --> 05:57.281
- A little young even by
your disreputable standards

05:57.379 --> 05:58.379
aren't they, Kenny?

05:58.481 --> 06:00.280
- Who? Kimmy and Dawn?

06:00.381 --> 06:02.451
- What are they, half your age?

06:03.951 --> 06:05.551
- So, what'd you
give them anyway?

06:05.653 --> 06:07.822
- Two dollar bottle of wine.

06:09.588 --> 06:12.027
Oh, come on. It's
New Year's Eve.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.522
Like we never used to
do anything like that

06:13.624 --> 06:16.223
when we were their age.

06:16.325 --> 06:19.624
- Speaking of which, you gonna
go to Pete's party tonight?

06:19.728 --> 06:21.697
If so, can you, can
you bring some beer?

06:21.796 --> 06:22.366
If you go.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.033
- Can't. Got plans.

06:25.131 --> 06:27.600
- When's Aunt Claire's
car gettin' fixed anyway?

06:27.700 --> 06:29.869
- Two, three days, I think.

06:29.968 --> 06:33.367
Oh, and she said that
she wants to talk to you.

06:33.471 --> 06:34.201
- When? Tonight?

06:34.304 --> 06:35.244
Uh-huh.

06:35.338 --> 06:36.437
- No way.

06:36.539 --> 06:38.708
- I'm just tellin'
ya what she said.

06:45.211 --> 06:46.871
Good luck.

06:46.980 --> 06:49.019
Hey, Mom!

06:49.114 --> 06:50.314
- Goin' out with Owen tonight?

06:50.415 --> 06:51.584
- Hell no!

06:51.683 --> 06:53.482
And miss New Year's
Eve dinner with you?

06:53.584 --> 06:54.954
- Set the table then, all right?

06:55.051 --> 06:56.081
- Yes, ma'am!

06:58.454 --> 06:59.793
- Hey, Aunt Claire.

06:59.888 --> 07:01.148
- I guess you don't
have enough manners

07:01.255 --> 07:02.764
to come in and have
a cup of coffee.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.856
- Aw, I'm runnin' late
for something, I'm sorry.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.057
- So, the great state of
Maryland has decided to

07:07.159 --> 07:08.598
release his brother.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.494
- Oh, Victor's gettin' out?

07:11.096 --> 07:12.325
Well, that's great.

07:12.429 --> 07:13.729
- He'll be a free man
in a couple of weeks.

07:13.831 --> 07:15.800
- What, you need me to
pick him up or something?

07:15.899 --> 07:16.899
- That,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.569
and I need you to hang
on to him for a bit.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.637
- Why?

07:21.736 --> 07:23.805
- Victor and I haven't seen
eye to eye since he went away.

07:23.904 --> 07:26.603
I was hoping he might come
live with you for a while.

07:26.706 --> 07:28.776
- Well, you're not givin' me
much time to think about it.

07:28.874 --> 07:30.573
- You think you could
use somebody to talk to

07:30.675 --> 07:32.544
livin' in that big
house all by yourself?

07:32.643 --> 07:34.583
- Hey, it's not that big.

07:36.178 --> 07:38.677
- We're family.

07:38.780 --> 07:40.420
And like it or not you don't
have that many of us left.

07:40.516 --> 07:43.585
And this is what families do.

07:43.684 --> 07:46.213
They help one another
in times of need.

08:01.862 --> 08:03.632
- You're doin' the garage
bar again this year?

08:03.731 --> 08:05.800
- Hey, if it ain't broke.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.835
Where's the beer?

08:09.400 --> 08:11.099
- I fucked up man.

08:11.201 --> 08:12.241
- Don't worry about it.

08:12.336 --> 08:13.236
- No, you told me
to get the beer.

08:13.337 --> 08:15.106
I should've gotten the beer.

08:17.005 --> 08:18.445
You're an asshole.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.270
- I tell five guys they're
in charge of bursting

08:20.374 --> 08:21.844
forth and gettin' beer.

08:21.943 --> 08:25.112
I figured there's a chance one
of you guys'll get it done.

08:26.211 --> 08:27.411
Speakin' of...

08:27.513 --> 08:29.652
My cousin Melissa's
comin' down from Philly.

08:29.748 --> 08:31.307
Says she's lookin' to get laid.

08:31.414 --> 08:33.583
I put your name on
top of the list.

08:33.683 --> 08:35.823
- No, I can't cheat
on Pam anymore.

08:36.217 --> 08:37.756
- What?

08:37.852 --> 08:39.783
What, are you in love
with the hairdresser?

08:39.888 --> 08:43.027
- No, but I have to stop
sleeping with other women.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.390
It's rude.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.860
- Whatever.

08:48.894 --> 08:50.593
- You ever get up
to Philadelphia?

08:50.695 --> 08:53.394
- I've only been like 30
miles outside of Maryland

08:53.496 --> 08:54.636
my entire life.

08:54.731 --> 08:55.800
Really?

08:55.898 --> 08:57.098
- Yeah.

08:57.199 --> 08:58.298
- I went all over
Europe when I was younger.

08:58.399 --> 08:59.529
Is my talking bothering you?

08:59.634 --> 09:01.003
- I guess not.

09:01.101 --> 09:02.601
- It's just we
don't know each other so well,

09:02.703 --> 09:04.912
and after this I'm
gonna mingle a bit.

09:05.004 --> 09:06.234
- Okay.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.135
- You have any kids?

09:10.174 --> 09:11.104
- I have a son.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.907
- Oh, you have to meet my Mandy.

09:14.010 --> 09:15.350
She's 10.

09:15.444 --> 09:17.543
Maybe you can make Mandy laugh.

09:17.646 --> 09:18.845
She gets grumpy.

09:18.946 --> 09:20.316
- I will if I ever meet her.

09:20.414 --> 09:21.514
- You'll meet her
tonight, silly.

09:21.616 --> 09:23.215
She's downstairs.

09:23.316 --> 09:24.985
- She's what?

09:39.694 --> 09:40.994
- Hey, Owen.

09:41.095 --> 09:42.095
- Hey, Vera.

09:42.196 --> 09:44.965
- Can you please give
me a glass of water?

09:45.064 --> 09:46.093
- Yeah.

09:46.198 --> 09:47.708
- Someone just gave me a
large shot of some weird

09:47.800 --> 09:50.359
brown liquid and yelled at
me until I drank it all.

09:50.467 --> 09:51.436
- There you go.
- Thanks.

09:51.534 --> 09:52.534
- Yep.

10:02.610 --> 10:04.239
- You okay?

10:06.244 --> 10:09.443
- I'm sure wherever my ex
-husband is, he is not freaking out

10:09.546 --> 10:12.645
in the kitchen of some
New Year's Eve party.

10:12.749 --> 10:14.919
- I'm sure he doesn't look
as nice as you do either.

10:15.018 --> 10:15.957
- Aw, thanks.

10:16.051 --> 10:17.621
It's obviously too
much for this place,

10:17.720 --> 10:20.649
but I have no idea
what I'm doing.

10:20.755 --> 10:22.454
- Yeah, well take it from me.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.094
I've been divorced
for a few years.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.264
It gets easier.

10:27.158 --> 10:29.828
- I've never really
been on my own.

10:30.994 --> 10:32.834
Before Martin and I separated,

10:32.929 --> 10:34.129
there was never a
night in my life

10:34.230 --> 10:36.029
where there wasn't
someone that I could

10:36.131 --> 10:39.000
say good night to
as I went to bed.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.009
- Hold on a second.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.699
- What are you doing?

10:50.807 --> 10:52.417
- I'm giving you my number.

10:52.508 --> 10:54.107
So, when you go to bed

10:54.877 --> 10:56.736
I want you to call me

10:57.712 --> 10:59.312
and tell me good night.

11:03.115 --> 11:04.045
- Thank you.

11:04.150 --> 11:05.649
No problem.

11:07.452 --> 11:08.591
You know what?

11:08.686 --> 11:10.716
We should go on a date sometime.

11:10.821 --> 11:13.490
That's the first thing you
need to do when you get single,

11:13.589 --> 11:15.058
just go on a bunch of dates.

11:15.157 --> 11:16.397
Date a bunch of dudes.

11:16.491 --> 11:17.550
I mean, who cares, you know.

11:17.659 --> 11:19.059
You just need to
get outta your head.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.829
- Owen, that's really sweet
but I'm afraid that I'd -

11:21.928 --> 11:25.627
I would be using
you as a rebound.

11:26.497 --> 11:28.497
- No pressure.

11:28.599 --> 11:30.668
I'm not goin' anywhere.

11:32.702 --> 11:34.202
- Yeah. Okay.

11:34.303 --> 11:36.342
- It's just a piece of
paper with some numbers on it.

11:36.437 --> 11:37.707
- Just a piece of paper, okay.

11:37.806 --> 11:39.835
Thank you for the
piece of paper.

11:52.649 --> 11:53.448
- Owen!

11:53.548 --> 11:54.348
- Yes. Hey.

11:54.449 --> 11:55.519
- Let's take a shot.

11:55.617 --> 11:57.076
- I can't do anymore.

11:57.185 --> 11:58.555
- No, there are these mango
things. It's so fuckin' good.

11:58.653 --> 11:59.952
Just one shot.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.453
- That sounds exotic but
I can't do shots anymore.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.493
I'm good. I got beer.

12:02.588 --> 12:03.588
- Don't be so fuckin' boring.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.759
- I'm good. I'm good.

12:06.524 --> 12:07.893
- Jackie, let's take a shot.

12:07.992 --> 12:10.052
- Oh okay, but I'm Linda.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.769
- Whatever.

12:25.237 --> 12:27.036
Dear Jen,

12:27.138 --> 12:29.837
For some reason, I thought
if I got up on the roof

12:29.940 --> 12:33.139
I'd be able to see
for miles around.

12:34.176 --> 12:35.805
Turns out I can
only see the roof

12:35.911 --> 12:38.220
of the house across the street.

12:40.280 --> 12:43.418
I wonder if anyone would
even notice that I'm gone.

12:49.953 --> 12:52.822
I should just leave that there.

13:06.031 --> 13:07.130
Oh!

13:15.470 --> 13:16.729
Jen.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.278
They say what you're
doing on New Year's Eve

13:18.372 --> 13:21.101
is what you'll be doing
all of the next year.

13:22.407 --> 13:25.236
To be honest...
- Happy New Year!

13:25.343 --> 13:29.052
I'm not so sure I could handle
another 12 months of this.

13:31.981 --> 13:34.120
- I heard you were
here somewhere.

13:34.215 --> 13:35.245
Angie.

13:35.350 --> 13:37.249
They got you workin'
on New Year's Eve?

13:37.351 --> 13:40.060
- Yeah, anything to get
away from my family.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.856
C'mon.

13:49.993 --> 13:52.992
So, turns out you
can't fly, huh.

13:53.095 --> 13:55.634
- Aw, that was just
my first attempt.

13:55.730 --> 13:57.100
- You up on the roof
at the ale house?

13:57.198 --> 13:59.167
- Mm-hmm. No, I
was over at Pete's.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.525
He was having a party.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.972
- Pete. Is he still an asshole?

14:03.701 --> 14:05.171
- Pretty much.

14:05.270 --> 14:06.709
- I always thought you
were so much smarter

14:06.804 --> 14:08.474
than those guys you get
drunk with every night.

14:08.572 --> 14:09.931
- They're okay.

14:10.039 --> 14:11.779
- You think everyone's okay.

14:11.875 --> 14:12.844
But I didn't see
any of your friends

14:12.941 --> 14:15.410
in the waiting room with you.

14:15.509 --> 14:17.139
- I did notice that.

14:17.244 --> 14:18.843
- Well, you should
give that more

14:18.945 --> 14:21.015
than just a passing thought.

14:21.881 --> 14:23.451
I got that.

14:23.548 --> 14:25.317
- All right, thanks.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.215
Here ya go.

15:08.445 --> 15:09.844
Hi.

15:12.147 --> 15:12.987
- Hey.

15:13.081 --> 15:14.341
- Think this is yours.

15:14.449 --> 15:16.188
Ah, shit.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.283
Thanks.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.647
How's it goin' Todd?

15:20.752 --> 15:22.852
- About the same.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.494
- I was just
takin' him for a walk,

15:24.588 --> 15:26.487
and I thought I'd
check up on you.

15:26.589 --> 15:28.089
How's your arm?

15:28.191 --> 15:29.191
- Still broken.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.801
- You need any
help with anything?

15:31.894 --> 15:33.353
No, I'll be fine.

15:36.663 --> 15:38.232
Hey, Pete!

15:39.632 --> 15:40.462
Hey!

15:41.233 --> 15:42.163
Wake up!

15:44.768 --> 15:46.178
Hey, Pete!

15:46.270 --> 15:48.269
You wanna be the first
one to sign my -

15:48.371 --> 15:49.371
Oh shit.

15:49.472 --> 15:50.641
Well, look at that!

15:50.739 --> 15:52.309
- Let's not
get all excited.

15:53.207 --> 15:54.837
- Hey!

15:54.943 --> 15:56.842
- Pam, Get outta my way
I'm gonna smash Pete

15:56.944 --> 15:58.084
in the head with this.

15:58.178 --> 15:59.177
- Go home!

15:59.278 --> 16:00.708
It's not like we were
married or anything.

16:00.813 --> 16:01.583
You're just someone I
like to get stoned with.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.549
- Oh, that was it?!

16:02.647 --> 16:03.377
- Yeah, that's it!

16:03.481 --> 16:04.281
I'm with Pete now.

16:04.382 --> 16:06.121
- You are?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.386
- Fuck you both.

16:07.484 --> 16:09.583
- Look c'mon, let's talk
about this rationally. C'mon.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.214
- Yeah, okay.

16:11.319 --> 16:12.529
Oh my god!

16:13.788 --> 16:15.127
- That's the
rational thing to do!

16:15.222 --> 16:15.922
What?!

16:16.023 --> 16:16.992
Get outta here!

16:17.090 --> 16:19.120
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

16:19.225 --> 16:19.824
Shit!

16:19.925 --> 16:20.925
- I deserved that.

16:21.026 --> 16:22.266
- Just put your head back.

16:22.361 --> 16:24.060
Ooo, shit he fucked you
up. Yeah, its broken.

16:48.744 --> 16:50.283
- Yeah.

16:50.379 --> 16:52.149
Hi. Owen?

16:52.247 --> 16:53.106
- Who's this?

16:53.214 --> 16:54.654
- Oh,
it's, it's Vera.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.347
Is it too late to call you?

16:56.449 --> 16:57.019
- Vera?

16:57.117 --> 16:58.117
Yeah.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.346
- No. I'm up. What's goin' on?

17:01.452 --> 17:05.391
- I feel silly but
you told me to call you so...

17:05.821 --> 17:07.181
- I did?

17:08.023 --> 17:09.154
Yeah.

17:09.258 --> 17:10.058
- I did.

17:11.826 --> 17:13.165
Don't feel silly.

17:13.260 --> 17:14.390
What's goin' on?

17:14.494 --> 17:18.204
- Okay,
well, um, good night.

17:19.964 --> 17:21.435
- Good night.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.733
I was thinkin' we
should make a plan to -

17:26.203 --> 17:27.103
Hello?

17:29.438 --> 17:31.167
- That
looks like it hurt.

17:31.940 --> 17:33.410
- Not really.

17:34.208 --> 17:34.948
Kind of.

17:35.042 --> 17:37.541
- The more things change.

17:37.643 --> 17:39.842
- Cindy, don't start, all right.

17:41.446 --> 17:43.585
Oh, here's your check.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.879
So, we can avoid that fight.

17:49.518 --> 17:51.618
- I've been meaning
to tell you something.

17:51.719 --> 17:52.489
- Huh?

17:53.821 --> 17:54.920
What?

17:56.123 --> 17:56.893
Hey!

17:56.990 --> 17:58.459
Hi.

17:58.557 --> 17:59.827
Ready to go?

17:59.926 --> 18:01.025
- I guess.

18:01.126 --> 18:02.056
- Sweetheart, why
don't you go wait

18:02.160 --> 18:03.000
in the van for your dad, okay?

18:03.094 --> 18:05.193
He'll be right out.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.767
- What's that about?

18:11.866 --> 18:14.765
- I've been offered a
position in San Diego.

18:14.868 --> 18:17.837
Obviously, I would
take Adam with me.

18:17.938 --> 18:19.697
- San Diego?

18:19.804 --> 18:20.944
That's like on the
other side of the world.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.169
I'd never see him.

18:22.273 --> 18:24.013
- You barely see him as it is.

18:24.108 --> 18:27.376
And even when you do, you're
usually half in the bag.

18:29.245 --> 18:31.504
It wouldn't be until
the end of the year.

18:31.612 --> 18:34.281
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm thinking about it.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.690
- You can't just take my
son away from me like that.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.012
- Actually, I can.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.416
- Do you wanna get the
lawyers involved again?

18:39.517 --> 18:40.517
Is that it?

18:40.618 --> 18:42.257
- Right. Because a judge
would rule in favor

18:42.353 --> 18:45.492
of a father who drunkenly
falls off rooftops at parties.

18:53.994 --> 18:55.864
- I think you're being
incredibly selfish.

18:55.963 --> 18:58.332
- Well, now you
know how it feels.

19:02.133 --> 19:03.892
- So, what's the verdict?

19:04.001 --> 19:06.110
- They're like wearing pillows.

19:06.202 --> 19:07.862
- Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

19:07.971 --> 19:09.430
I think it's great.

19:10.705 --> 19:12.004
- Hey listen, about last week.

19:12.106 --> 19:13.576
I got the days mixed up.

19:13.674 --> 19:14.803
It's my fault.

19:14.907 --> 19:17.017
- Okay.

19:17.110 --> 19:18.409
- Maybe next week we can
go to the steakhouse.

19:18.510 --> 19:19.380
- I guess.

19:19.478 --> 19:20.877
- What do
you mean, you guess?

19:20.979 --> 19:22.279
You used to love
that steakhouse.

19:22.380 --> 19:24.379
- I kinda don't
eat meat anymore.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.144
- Well...

19:28.650 --> 19:30.189
You know, we can go to Louie's

19:30.285 --> 19:31.785
get that chicken thing you like.

19:31.886 --> 19:32.855
- You don't listen to me.

19:32.953 --> 19:34.113
- What? I'm listening.

19:34.221 --> 19:35.261
- No. You say you
wanna hang out with me,

19:35.355 --> 19:36.924
but you don't really listen.

19:37.023 --> 19:39.422
I said I don't eat meat anymore.

19:39.857 --> 19:41.227
- All right.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.160
Hey.

19:46.029 --> 19:47.588
Sorry, I was distracted.

19:47.696 --> 19:49.106
- Well, I don't eat meat.

19:49.198 --> 19:50.397
- Can you eat pasta?

19:50.498 --> 19:52.068
- Yeah, I eat pasta.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.865
- We'll go to that
pasta place then.

19:54.968 --> 19:57.337
Let's go pick up
your Uncle Kenny.

20:07.143 --> 20:10.512
- Why's that policeman
talking to Uncle Kenny?

20:10.612 --> 20:12.211
I don't know.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.479
I'm sure it's nothing though.

20:31.159 --> 20:32.398
- Goodbye, Uncle Kenny.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.521
- Yeah. See you
later, little man.

20:35.628 --> 20:37.298
- Thanks for the shoes, Dad.

20:38.596 --> 20:40.136
- You're welcome.

20:43.633 --> 20:47.372
- So, what really
happened to the arm?

20:47.969 --> 20:48.869
- Fell off a roof.

20:50.038 --> 20:51.638
- You drunk.

20:51.739 --> 20:52.668
Whatever.

20:52.772 --> 20:54.542
What did that cop really want?

20:54.641 --> 20:57.610
- You know that girl who...

20:57.709 --> 21:01.607
Kimmy, who came into
the store the other day?

21:01.711 --> 21:02.781
- Yeah.

21:02.879 --> 21:05.188
- I guess she's in a coma.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.581
Alcohol poisoning.

21:07.682 --> 21:08.882
- Huh.

21:08.983 --> 21:10.812
I think I saw her at
the clinic, actually,

21:10.917 --> 21:12.727
when I was gettin'
my arm fixed up.

21:12.819 --> 21:13.518
- Yeah?

21:13.619 --> 21:14.819
Yeah.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.089
- Yeah, her parents found
her, and she was passed out,

21:19.990 --> 21:21.390
and called the police.

21:21.492 --> 21:23.431
- Did you tell that cop
you gave her alcohol?

21:24.461 --> 21:25.600
- No.

21:25.694 --> 21:26.924
- I thought you just said
it was some crappy wine.

21:27.029 --> 21:28.098
- Yeah, well.

21:28.196 --> 21:29.726
Just a little bit stronger.

21:30.298 --> 21:31.627
- What?

21:31.731 --> 21:32.971
- It was grain.

21:33.067 --> 21:36.966
But I told, I told her
that she had to mix it

21:37.069 --> 21:38.379
with a Kool-Aid or something.

21:38.470 --> 21:40.499
- What the hell
were you thinkin', man?

21:40.604 --> 21:41.504
Grain?

21:41.605 --> 21:44.074
- Just do me a
favor and promise me

21:44.174 --> 21:46.773
that you're not gonna
tell my mom about the cop.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.115
- It's a small town.

21:48.210 --> 21:49.279
If a cop comes to your
store asking questions,

21:49.377 --> 21:50.977
she's gonna find
out sooner or later.

21:51.079 --> 21:53.078
- Promise.

21:54.846 --> 21:55.816
All right, I promise.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.913
- Okay.

21:58.015 --> 21:59.615
- She's been on me
about pickin' up Victor

21:59.717 --> 22:01.886
when he gets out.

22:01.985 --> 22:03.854
You're comin' with me, right?

22:03.952 --> 22:05.322
- Nope.

22:07.889 --> 22:10.198
I got my own problems.

22:22.065 --> 22:23.095
Ah, man.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.469
- Hey, man.

22:26.668 --> 22:28.437
You got everything?

22:28.536 --> 22:29.566
- Lost my sanity.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.809
I was able to keep
my anal virginity.

22:31.905 --> 22:33.275
What time the strip clubs open?

22:33.372 --> 22:35.002
- I think your mom's
got some welcome back

22:35.108 --> 22:36.807
from prison dinner
planned for you tonight.

22:36.908 --> 22:38.118
- Oh, that's good. It's ironic.

22:38.210 --> 22:39.669
'Cause they didn't
visit me once in prison.

22:39.776 --> 22:40.746
- What are you talkin' about?

22:40.844 --> 22:42.283
I came to visit you.

22:42.378 --> 22:44.438
- That's because you were
stocking the vending machines.

22:45.014 --> 22:46.513
- Still visited.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.755
- Yeah, that's true.

22:47.849 --> 22:48.978
Kenny gonna be there?

22:49.083 --> 22:50.723
- Yeah, I think so.

22:50.818 --> 22:52.487
- I don't think I can make it.

22:52.585 --> 22:54.114
- What, you got somewhere
else you gotta be?

22:54.220 --> 22:56.160
- Yeah, I gotta be
in a champagne room

22:56.255 --> 22:58.984
with a fistful of singles
and a toothy grin.

22:59.090 --> 23:01.729
- Waiting one more night's
not gonna kill you.

23:01.825 --> 23:02.994
What if it did?

23:03.092 --> 23:04.092
Feel awfully guilty
then, wouldn't you?

23:04.193 --> 23:05.893
- I'd get over it.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.293
- Yeah.

23:07.395 --> 23:10.764
You know what? I don't
think I can live with you.

23:10.864 --> 23:11.933
- Hey man, you
just tell me where

23:12.031 --> 23:12.931
you want me to drop you off.

23:13.032 --> 23:14.362
It's fine by me.

23:14.467 --> 23:15.706
- Nah, it's 'cause
you're a moody person.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.570
And that can wear on a
guy everyday, you know.

23:17.669 --> 23:18.338
- I'm not moody.

23:18.436 --> 23:19.466
Oh, you're not?

23:19.570 --> 23:20.400
- No.

23:20.504 --> 23:21.973
I'm taciturn.

23:22.071 --> 23:22.971
- Is that what it is?

23:23.072 --> 23:24.511
- Yep.

23:26.642 --> 23:29.511
- I'm gonna look that
word up when I get home.

23:29.610 --> 23:31.109
- So, now
I'm completely fucked

23:31.211 --> 23:32.980
because anything I'm even
remotely interested in

23:33.078 --> 23:34.578
is related to computers.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.049
And that all has to be put on
hold for the next five years.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.988
I mean, you know
how much technology

23:39.082 --> 23:41.851
changes in five years, Owen.

23:41.951 --> 23:43.421
That's like a death sentence.

23:43.519 --> 23:46.088
I might as well become
Amish or something.

23:46.188 --> 23:48.687
Hmm, look at that.

23:48.789 --> 23:51.218
Could've used that in prison.

23:51.324 --> 23:53.264
Anyways, I'm hopin' that
Occupy movement starts back up

23:53.360 --> 23:56.159
because economic distribution
in this country is so

23:56.262 --> 23:58.831
vertically hierarchical
that it makes me wanna puke.

23:58.929 --> 24:01.228
Campin' out on the White
House lawn with a bullhorn,

24:01.331 --> 24:02.900
tauntin' the man.

24:02.998 --> 24:04.238
That's more my speed, you know.

24:04.333 --> 24:06.362
- Yeah, I hate to
break it to you but

24:06.468 --> 24:08.807
that Occupy movement
is pretty much dead.

24:08.902 --> 24:10.632
- Yeah, well.

24:10.737 --> 24:12.946
Gotta be something for
me to protest, you know.

24:13.038 --> 24:14.197
- You just got out of jail.

24:14.306 --> 24:16.076
You really wanna go right back?

24:16.175 --> 24:17.314
- Hell no, man.

24:17.408 --> 24:19.008
Prison changes a person.

24:19.109 --> 24:21.378
- Clearly.

24:21.478 --> 24:22.608
Hey, man.

24:22.712 --> 24:25.251
So, I wanna take this.

24:34.952 --> 24:35.822
- Hello.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.920
It's me.

24:37.021 --> 24:38.120
- Hey.

24:38.822 --> 24:39.652
I...

24:39.756 --> 24:40.995
- What's goin' on?

24:41.090 --> 24:42.590
- I have to get
the pipes fixed or something

24:42.692 --> 24:44.621
the water at my place is
kind of brown and chunky.

24:44.726 --> 24:47.595
So, I went out to get
some bottled stuff

24:47.695 --> 24:51.364
and now I'm just driving
around until I get tired.

24:54.032 --> 24:55.372
- Where are you?

24:55.467 --> 24:57.066
- Right outside
your house, actually.

24:57.168 --> 25:01.367
I saw your van and I
pulled in. Is that weird?

25:01.471 --> 25:03.540
- Yes, that's kinda weird.

25:03.639 --> 25:05.678
Oh hey.

25:05.773 --> 25:07.572
What happened to your arm?

25:07.674 --> 25:09.514
- Oh.

25:09.610 --> 25:11.409
I broke it at the
party after you left.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.980
- Oh, did
you get in a fight?

25:14.078 --> 25:16.378
I hear that you like
to get into fights.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.610
Who told you that?

25:17.715 --> 25:19.255
- Been asking
around about you.

25:19.350 --> 25:20.979
- Yeah, well don't believe
everything you hear.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.123
Why not?

25:22.219 --> 25:24.648
- 'Cause it's probably all true.

25:25.886 --> 25:29.225
- Nope, I think
you might be sweet.

25:33.158 --> 25:34.957
Well, good night.

25:35.059 --> 25:36.499
- Good night.

25:52.638 --> 25:55.167
- Beer,
beer, beer is fine,

25:55.273 --> 25:57.873
but I'd rather be drinking wine.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.311
Dear Jen,

26:06.414 --> 26:07.843
Isn't strange how sometimes
you can surround yourself

26:07.948 --> 26:09.957
with a whole crowd of people,

26:10.049 --> 26:12.778
yet still feel alone.

26:12.884 --> 26:16.423
Seems to be a pretty common
feeling for me lately.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.719
I think if you were here,

26:18.821 --> 26:20.721
I wouldn't be so alone.

26:21.157 --> 26:22.526
Wow,

26:22.624 --> 26:24.953
is that depressing or what?

26:27.994 --> 26:30.523
- Thank you, sir.
Have a nice day.

26:32.030 --> 26:32.840
- Hey, Vera.

26:32.931 --> 26:34.860
- Hi.

26:34.966 --> 26:36.066
- I need some coin sleeves.

26:36.167 --> 26:37.636
- Okay.

26:37.734 --> 26:39.274
Here to help.

26:40.002 --> 26:41.902
- You're gonna regret that.

26:45.506 --> 26:47.506
Welcome to my world.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.874
- Did you know that it
costs almost 21/2 cents

26:51.977 --> 26:53.747
to produce a penny?

26:53.845 --> 26:54.844
- Really?

26:54.945 --> 26:56.945
- Yeah, and over 11
cents to make a nickel.

26:57.047 --> 26:58.246
I didn't know that.

26:58.348 --> 26:59.918
- Seems like a
waste of money, huh?

27:00.016 --> 27:03.284
- Sometimes I wonder if all
this change is worth it.

27:04.452 --> 27:06.121
They ever catch that guy?

27:06.219 --> 27:07.719
The robber.

27:07.821 --> 27:09.220
- Not yet.

27:10.590 --> 27:12.789
We aren't exactly
Fort Knox around here.

27:12.891 --> 27:14.721
You know, if I were the
manager I would make sure

27:14.826 --> 27:18.834
there was at least one
working security camera.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.128
- Well, you're making
me feel real comfortable

27:20.229 --> 27:21.298
about banking here.

27:21.397 --> 27:23.727
- Oh, don't worry we're insured.

27:25.032 --> 27:26.202
- Manager, huh?

27:26.301 --> 27:27.370
- I think about it.

27:27.467 --> 27:29.607
- Well, in 15, 20
years from now.

27:29.703 --> 27:33.271
They're gonna look back
and say, "The bank robbery

27:33.371 --> 27:36.270
"that was the time
before Vera was manager.

27:36.373 --> 27:39.972
"Before she restored law
and order to these parts."

27:40.710 --> 27:42.839
- You know, Tower Oaks Lodge?

27:43.177 --> 27:44.407
- Yeah.

27:44.513 --> 27:46.952
- Come by there Friday
night. Eight o'clock.

27:48.047 --> 27:49.517
- I'm not ready to date.

27:49.616 --> 27:51.675
- Date? No, I didn't say date.

27:51.783 --> 27:53.253
Did I say date?

27:53.352 --> 27:54.691
I'm talkin' about dessert.

27:54.785 --> 27:56.884
There'll be other people
around. Don't worry.

27:56.986 --> 27:59.286
- I don't know.

27:59.389 --> 28:01.758
- What did you do
last Friday night?

28:02.090 --> 28:03.499
Exactly.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.289
C'mon, it's just dessert.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.799
Hey.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.300
Your mom says if you don't
eat some of these vegetables

28:19.402 --> 28:21.941
I'm supposed to stick
them in your ear.

28:22.037 --> 28:24.166
I don't know how you're supposed
to get nutrients that way,

28:24.271 --> 28:26.340
but I'll do it.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.050
- She always used to say
that when we were little.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.319
- Well, you look like you
haven't eaten in a week.

28:34.412 --> 28:35.841
- I'm eating.

28:36.580 --> 28:37.810
So...

28:38.681 --> 28:39.881
Victor livin' with you now?

28:39.982 --> 28:42.751
- Oh yeah, got
him all settled in.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.880
Why don't you just buy
your own damn groceries?

28:44.985 --> 28:46.395
- 'Cause...

28:48.888 --> 28:50.457
Can't go into town.

28:51.990 --> 28:53.729
Feels like I'm on display.

28:55.326 --> 28:57.055
- Yeah, Aunt Claire told me what

28:57.160 --> 28:59.169
that girl's accusing you of.

28:59.261 --> 29:00.591
- Yep.

29:04.065 --> 29:05.704
- So?

29:07.100 --> 29:08.329
- So?

29:13.704 --> 29:15.044
So?

29:23.043 --> 29:25.343
I gave her alcohol. Owen.

29:27.013 --> 29:29.482
I didn't take advantage of her.

29:29.582 --> 29:32.311
I never even saw her that night.

29:32.884 --> 29:34.314
Fuck.

29:34.418 --> 29:36.728
- Okay, then.

29:36.820 --> 29:38.849
Look, if that's the case we
need to get you a lawyer,

29:38.954 --> 29:39.894
right now.

29:39.989 --> 29:41.318
- No. No.

29:42.824 --> 29:43.823
No.

29:43.924 --> 29:47.593
That's just gonna, gonna
make me look guilty.

29:47.694 --> 29:51.063
- And hiding out here
in the woods doesn't?

29:56.466 --> 29:58.835
- So, do you
think you could do it?

29:58.934 --> 30:00.304
Be a coach?

30:00.403 --> 30:01.562
I don't know.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.679
- Assistant coach.
Matthew's dad is coach,

30:03.771 --> 30:05.800
and Jack's dad keeps stats.

30:05.906 --> 30:08.205
You could just help with
the practices and stuff.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.576
You wouldn't have to
travel or anything.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.115
Mom said you'd
probably be too busy.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.239
- I don't know being a coach
doesn't really seem like...

30:14.344 --> 30:16.013
- Seem like what?

30:19.180 --> 30:21.020
- You know what? I'll do it.

30:21.116 --> 30:22.715
Really? You'll do it?

30:23.150 --> 30:24.320
- Why not?

30:24.419 --> 30:26.358
Hi.

30:26.453 --> 30:27.513
Meet my son, Adam.

30:27.621 --> 30:28.960
- This is your date.

30:29.054 --> 30:30.224
Mm-hmm.

30:30.322 --> 30:31.251
I just agreed to be
his baseball coach.

30:31.355 --> 30:32.825
- Oh that's awful nice of you.

30:32.924 --> 30:33.853
I thought so.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.097
- Dad. If you say
you're gonna do it,

30:35.191 --> 30:36.790
you have to do it.

30:36.892 --> 30:37.822
- I'm gonna do it.

30:37.927 --> 30:39.067
- But I have
to tell the league

30:39.161 --> 30:39.960
and if you don't do it -

30:40.061 --> 30:41.161
- Adam. Leave it alone.

30:41.262 --> 30:43.001
Before I change my mind.

30:45.298 --> 30:46.967
- What position do you play?

30:47.066 --> 30:47.996
- Third base.

30:48.100 --> 30:49.339
- My brother used to play that.

30:49.435 --> 30:50.895
You think you can get me
some half price tickets

30:51.002 --> 30:52.101
to some of your games?

30:52.202 --> 30:53.612
- The tickets are free.

30:53.704 --> 30:56.173
- Well, then I might just
come to one or two of them.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.931
- We were just about
to have dessert.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.480
Care to join us?

31:00.808 --> 31:03.477
- Yeah. It sounds
like a good idea.

31:08.247 --> 31:10.086
You smell good.

31:10.181 --> 31:10.911
- Do I?

31:11.015 --> 31:12.354
- Mm-hmm.

31:12.450 --> 31:13.920
Adam come here.

31:14.017 --> 31:14.747
Smell her.

31:14.852 --> 31:16.191
- No, you don't have to do that.

31:16.285 --> 31:17.545
- Go on.

31:23.591 --> 31:25.060
You smell really nice.

31:26.025 --> 31:27.354
- Thank you.

31:27.460 --> 31:28.870
What is it?

31:28.961 --> 31:29.861
- It's soap.

31:29.962 --> 31:31.461
And shampoo.

31:31.563 --> 31:34.462
And maybe a little perfume.

31:34.565 --> 31:35.765
You want cheesecake?

31:35.866 --> 31:36.605
- Yeah.

31:36.699 --> 31:38.399
You want cheesecake?
- Sure.

31:38.501 --> 31:39.970
- Garçon!

31:47.006 --> 31:48.435
Hey.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.440
Wake up.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.035
Wake up.

31:53.143 --> 31:53.942
C'mon, wake up.

31:55.044 --> 31:55.874
I gotta go to work.

31:55.979 --> 31:57.248
You wanna come with me?

31:57.345 --> 31:58.545
- Do I have a choice?

31:58.647 --> 32:00.946
Not really.

32:01.048 --> 32:02.987
Hey, so I went to
the cabin yesterday,

32:03.083 --> 32:04.413
and I saw Kenny.

32:04.518 --> 32:05.587
- Well, I really don't
wanna hear about my brother

32:05.685 --> 32:07.725
first thing in the morning.

32:11.789 --> 32:13.619
- You smell like a brewery.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.733
Mission accomplished.

32:20.928 --> 32:24.697
Wow, you're the
harbinger of tooth decay.

32:24.798 --> 32:27.397
- I am the provider of
temporary sustenance.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.569
- You keep dentists employed.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.967
- You keep strippers and
mental health workers employed.

32:32.069 --> 32:34.778
- Some would argue
they're one in the same.

32:34.871 --> 32:36.800
Hey, you know what would
be the ultimate irony?

32:36.906 --> 32:37.946
- What's that?

32:38.040 --> 32:40.839
- Is if this job came
with dental insurance.

32:40.942 --> 32:42.341
- You know what
this job comes with?

32:42.442 --> 32:43.242
What?

32:43.343 --> 32:44.882
- A job.

32:48.580 --> 32:51.579
- Hey, the van's
loaded Owen. We can go.

33:08.159 --> 33:10.659
- You know, it wouldn't
kill you to help out.

33:10.762 --> 33:13.960
- I'm not ready for that
kind of responsibility, yet.

33:17.398 --> 33:18.698
Oh!

33:19.400 --> 33:20.399
Dolly.

33:20.501 --> 33:21.501
Huh?

33:21.602 --> 33:23.241
Got it. Got it.

33:24.237 --> 33:25.537
Damn.

33:27.305 --> 33:28.405
It's gonna smell.

33:28.507 --> 33:29.746
Oh, but it itches too.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.101
- How much for
a bag of those chips?

33:31.208 --> 33:33.747
- Vic, give me a bag of chips.

33:36.311 --> 33:37.341
Here ya go.

33:37.446 --> 33:38.285
Free of charge.

33:38.379 --> 33:39.709
- Thanks.

33:39.814 --> 33:42.083
- Well, you did let me copy
your chemistry homework

33:42.182 --> 33:43.252
back in high school.

33:43.350 --> 33:44.819
- We didn't have
chemistry together.

33:44.917 --> 33:46.347
- See you opened
those chips before

33:46.451 --> 33:48.921
you volunteered
that information.

33:50.087 --> 33:50.987
I'm sorry.

33:51.088 --> 33:53.987
Am I not entertaining
enough for you?

33:54.090 --> 33:55.090
- Oh, I'm sorry Owen.

33:55.191 --> 33:58.030
Been goin' on no sleep
the past few weeks.

33:58.126 --> 33:59.995
- Dad on another bender?

34:00.962 --> 34:02.561
- Yeah.

34:02.663 --> 34:03.833
- I don't understand why
you don't just move out

34:03.930 --> 34:05.289
get your own place already.

34:05.397 --> 34:06.567
- I should.

34:06.666 --> 34:08.505
But where would I go?

34:09.100 --> 34:10.929
Who'd take care of Todd?

34:11.034 --> 34:12.873
- Yeah.

34:12.969 --> 34:15.438
Hey. Hey. If you're not gonna
work just get out of there.

34:15.538 --> 34:16.937
I'll do it.

34:20.608 --> 34:22.177
- He's moody.

34:22.275 --> 34:24.205
- At least he didn't go to jail.

34:38.219 --> 34:39.489
Dear Jen,

34:39.588 --> 34:42.886
I am trying but I'm
pretty sure Adam hates me.

34:42.989 --> 34:44.359
- Dad.

34:44.456 --> 34:46.025
- Yeah?

34:46.123 --> 34:47.784
- Nothing. Forget it.

34:49.694 --> 34:51.123
You see what I mean?

34:51.228 --> 34:53.297
He can't stand me.

34:54.330 --> 34:55.569
- Dad.

34:55.664 --> 34:56.434
- What's up?

34:56.531 --> 34:57.960
- It's just...

34:58.065 --> 34:59.065
- It's just what?

34:59.166 --> 35:00.805
- It's just that Jimmy
Chin at school said

35:00.901 --> 35:03.171
that there are
sharks in San Diego.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.628
Is that true?

35:04.737 --> 35:06.846
- I don't know. Why?

35:06.938 --> 35:09.038
- Mom said she was gonna
teach me how to surf.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.209
But I'm not so sure I
wanna learn anymore.

35:11.308 --> 35:13.177
- Well, I'm sure the
shark attacks in San Diego

35:13.275 --> 35:15.075
are pretty infrequent.

35:15.177 --> 35:16.806
Plus, you shouldn't let
the fear of the unknown

35:16.912 --> 35:19.121
stop you from tryin'
something new.

35:21.715 --> 35:23.245
Dear Jen...

35:24.783 --> 35:26.983
Well, that was new.

35:29.754 --> 35:30.923
- Do you know how to surf?

35:31.021 --> 35:32.921
- Me? No.

35:34.056 --> 35:35.156
- How come?

35:35.257 --> 35:36.166
- Scared of sharks.

35:36.257 --> 35:37.617
- Dad!

35:43.429 --> 35:44.799
- You're
just imagining it.

35:44.897 --> 35:46.996
Okay. All right.

35:47.098 --> 35:49.767
- Hey, how is
your arm doin' anyway?

35:49.867 --> 35:52.366
- It's feeling better
than my feet, apparently.

35:52.468 --> 35:53.338
- What?

35:53.436 --> 35:54.835
You're a very good dancer.

35:54.937 --> 35:57.206
- You're a very good liar.

35:58.539 --> 36:00.778
- Look, I'm gonna
leave my car here,

36:00.874 --> 36:02.813
if you can give me a ride home.

36:02.908 --> 36:05.238
It's just that I, that
last glass of wine

36:05.344 --> 36:06.743
went right to my head.

36:06.845 --> 36:09.614
- I had no idea you were
feeling tipsy at all.

36:09.713 --> 36:10.913
Well, I am.

36:11.014 --> 36:12.883
I'm...

36:12.982 --> 36:15.321
I am trying to invite
you back to my house

36:15.416 --> 36:17.845
without seeming too slutty.

36:17.952 --> 36:18.892
- Okay.

36:18.986 --> 36:21.415
Well, what would we
do at your house?

36:21.520 --> 36:23.629
- Oh, I'd take
you to my bedroom.

36:23.722 --> 36:24.722
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

36:24.823 --> 36:26.053
- What happens in your bedroom?

36:26.158 --> 36:28.157
- I strip you naked as
the day you were born.

36:28.259 --> 36:29.898
- All right, I like
where this is goin'.

36:29.993 --> 36:33.692
- And I would tie you down.

36:33.796 --> 36:35.595
- Kinky.
- Hands to the bedpost.

36:35.697 --> 36:37.857
- Very kinky. I'm into it.

36:37.966 --> 36:41.904
- And then I would
make you watch

36:42.001 --> 36:45.500
Unsolved Mysteries reruns.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.113
- I think maybe we
should call you a cab.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.804
- No, it's a really good show.
- That's a better idea.

36:48.906 --> 36:51.175
- You sure? No, c'mon -
- That's a better idea.

36:51.274 --> 36:52.034
- Shit.

36:52.141 --> 36:53.051
- What?

36:53.142 --> 36:54.371
- Martin's here.

36:54.476 --> 36:55.576
Oh yeah?

36:55.678 --> 36:56.547
- He's
heading right for us.

36:56.644 --> 36:57.844
Owen, don't hurt him.

36:57.945 --> 36:58.915
- I'm just gonna
talk to him. Martin.

36:59.013 --> 36:59.642
- Hey, Owen.

36:59.746 --> 37:01.116
Shit!

37:01.214 --> 37:03.013
- That's my wife you're
dancin' with you fuckin' prick!

37:03.916 --> 37:05.685
Get out of here!

37:05.784 --> 37:09.653
Address? One, four, eight.

37:10.287 --> 37:12.686
Cherry Tree Lane.

37:12.789 --> 37:15.018
- It's still weird
that you know that.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.091
- Insurance?

37:18.192 --> 37:19.832
Ah, here.

37:20.393 --> 37:22.093
There you go.

37:23.862 --> 37:27.231
- Seven, four, zero...

37:28.065 --> 37:30.204
Marital status?

37:31.367 --> 37:33.136
Divorced.

37:34.436 --> 37:36.105
I sure am looking forward
to sharing the news

37:36.204 --> 37:38.813
of my failed marriage at all
future doctor's appointments.

37:38.906 --> 37:40.106
- Oh, it gets better.

37:40.207 --> 37:41.436
Just wait till your
friends have to choose

37:41.540 --> 37:43.140
which one of you
to hang out with.

37:43.242 --> 37:45.181
- Well, most of our
couple-friends are Martin's

37:45.276 --> 37:48.175
friends from college,
so he can have them.

37:48.278 --> 37:50.077
Emergency contact?

37:55.482 --> 37:57.112
- I don't have one.

37:59.352 --> 38:01.052
- Vera Rodgers.

38:10.193 --> 38:11.592
I'm sorry.

38:11.694 --> 38:12.864
- It's fine.

38:12.962 --> 38:14.161
Really.

38:14.262 --> 38:15.732
I just hope it's the
last time I get punched

38:15.831 --> 38:17.900
in the face because of you.

38:18.933 --> 38:21.832
- Well, I am not
makin' any promises.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.508
- Why do I
feel like I'm always

38:24.602 --> 38:25.831
carryin' shit around with you?

38:25.937 --> 38:27.307
I don't know.

38:27.404 --> 38:29.703
Sounds like a question
for your therapist.

38:29.806 --> 38:32.815
All right, let's put
it right back here.

38:32.908 --> 38:34.637
Against the wall, right here.

38:34.743 --> 38:36.313
This is good.

38:36.410 --> 38:38.109
It's right by the door.

38:38.211 --> 38:39.481
- So, if you're so in
love with this girl

38:39.579 --> 38:40.548
why doesn't she just
move in with you

38:40.646 --> 38:41.746
instead of this place?

38:41.848 --> 38:42.917
- She's never been
single before.

38:43.014 --> 38:44.714
She wants to date a little bit.

38:44.816 --> 38:46.745
Which I'm totally fine with.

38:46.851 --> 38:48.820
And I'm not in love with her.

38:48.918 --> 38:51.018
- Ah, please. Really?

38:54.089 --> 38:55.428
I don't know, man. I don't know.

38:55.522 --> 38:56.922
Okay, okay. You know what? Fine.

38:57.024 --> 38:58.793
We'll say you're not
in love with her.

38:58.892 --> 39:00.222
You're not in love
with her. Okay.

39:00.326 --> 39:01.765
Let me get this straight,
we just lugged this

39:01.861 --> 39:03.561
fuckin' monster in here
so some other guys can

39:03.661 --> 39:04.691
have a drink of water
after they have sex

39:04.796 --> 39:06.106
with your girlfriend?

39:06.197 --> 39:06.896
- Whoa!

39:06.997 --> 39:07.897
It's not like that.

39:07.998 --> 39:09.298
But thank you for the image.

39:09.399 --> 39:11.698
- I don't know. It's
kinda of like that.

39:11.801 --> 39:13.900
So, you think Vera
could hook me up

39:14.002 --> 39:15.471
with one of those other
girls down at the bank?

39:15.569 --> 39:16.369
- Nope.

39:16.470 --> 39:17.710
Absolutely not.

39:17.805 --> 39:19.274
- What, they're not
good enough for me?

39:19.372 --> 39:21.831
- Ex-con and a bank teller.

39:21.940 --> 39:23.910
I think you can do better?

39:24.009 --> 39:25.448
- Thanks for lookin' out, Owen.

39:25.542 --> 39:26.742
- Always.

39:26.844 --> 39:28.843
- I'll get
some water. More water.

39:28.945 --> 39:30.714
For all those dudes.

39:30.813 --> 39:31.843
I'm sure there's
gonna be quite a bit,

39:31.947 --> 39:34.386
so you want me to get two cases?

39:46.891 --> 39:49.800
- You're pretty good at that.

39:49.893 --> 39:51.052
- My dad and I used to come here

39:51.159 --> 39:53.769
every spring when I was a kid.

39:56.197 --> 39:59.336
How is it that you have
never been crabbing before?

39:59.432 --> 40:01.631
You are aware we live
in Maryland, right?

40:01.733 --> 40:04.732
- Yeah, I eat them.
I don't catch them.

40:06.837 --> 40:09.806
Haven't been out here
since I was young, too.

40:09.906 --> 40:12.035
Forgot how beautiful it is.

40:13.641 --> 40:16.350
- We barely live an hour away.

40:16.443 --> 40:19.042
You just need to get out more.

40:29.352 --> 40:30.121
- See anything?

40:30.219 --> 40:32.079
Yeah, it's a long life.

40:33.855 --> 40:36.124
And lots of lovers.

40:36.756 --> 40:38.286
- Is there a number?

40:41.260 --> 40:42.429
- 71.

40:43.795 --> 40:46.924
- 71 years or lovers?

40:47.031 --> 40:48.600
- Hey! Yeah! I got one!
- You got it?

40:48.697 --> 40:50.197
Get it just slowly.

40:50.299 --> 40:51.838
- Okay, I got the net.
I got the net. I got the net.

40:51.934 --> 40:53.463
Whoa! Look at that!
Look at that guy!

40:54.668 --> 40:55.468
- No.

40:55.569 --> 40:56.378
- What are you doing?

40:56.469 --> 40:57.529
- No, he's too small.

40:57.637 --> 40:58.377
- That's dinner.
What are you doing?

40:58.471 --> 41:00.000
- He's too small.

41:00.105 --> 41:03.344
Hopefully, we will see him
again in a couple of months.

41:03.441 --> 41:05.011
Looked good to me.

41:05.109 --> 41:06.838
- Should you really
be goin' on a date

41:06.944 --> 41:09.113
if you're movin' to California?

41:09.211 --> 41:11.580
- Tonight is just a work thing.

41:11.679 --> 41:13.019
- Really?

41:13.114 --> 41:15.443
It's not what it looks like
from where I'm sittin'.

41:15.549 --> 41:17.448
Owen.

41:17.550 --> 41:20.189
You need to clean up your act.

41:20.285 --> 41:22.885
- Well, fortunately
for the both of us,

41:22.987 --> 41:24.927
my act is none of
your business anymore.

41:25.022 --> 41:26.551
- Actually, it is.

41:26.656 --> 41:28.726
For Adam's sake.

41:28.825 --> 41:30.294
Start acting more like a father,

41:30.392 --> 41:33.031
and get more involved
in your son's life.

41:33.127 --> 41:34.926
- What are you talking about?

41:35.028 --> 41:36.398
I'm here babysitting, aren't I?

41:36.496 --> 41:38.495
- It's not called babysitting
when you're his father.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.826
- Well, I agreed to help him
out with his baseball team.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.332
- Okay, but you
actually have to do it.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.572
You can't just say it.

41:44.668 --> 41:45.638
- I bought him shoes.

41:45.735 --> 41:47.034
- Wow.

41:47.136 --> 41:48.766
How 'bout stop going to
the alehouse every night?

41:48.872 --> 41:50.301
I have.

41:50.405 --> 41:51.605
- You know, you don't even
have to stop going every night,

41:51.706 --> 41:52.945
just once or twice a week.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.240
- I haven't had a
drink in months.

41:55.342 --> 41:56.841
- Really?

41:58.244 --> 41:59.713
- Really.

41:59.811 --> 42:01.111
- Really?

42:02.446 --> 42:04.456
- So, is Victor
stayin' out of trouble?

42:04.547 --> 42:06.777
I hear he's helpin' you
with your deliveries.

42:06.884 --> 42:09.323
- Oh yeah. He's
been a real help.

42:09.418 --> 42:10.917
- You'd think he'd
have the common decency

42:11.019 --> 42:12.989
to come see his momma
once in a while.

42:13.088 --> 42:15.387
- You haven't seen him
since he's been out?

42:15.489 --> 42:16.329
- No.

42:16.689 --> 42:18.059
- Huh.

42:18.157 --> 42:19.996
- So, I guess you've heard
they're chargin' my Kenny

42:20.092 --> 42:22.821
with assaultin' that girl?

42:22.927 --> 42:25.266
- Yeah. Yeah, I
heard about that.

42:25.361 --> 42:28.330
- The whole sordid affair is
movin' toward a damn trial.

42:28.430 --> 42:30.760
I had to put up the
house for his bail.

42:30.866 --> 42:32.165
- You did?

42:32.266 --> 42:33.076
- They're
calling him a flight risk.

42:33.167 --> 42:34.796
Could you believe that?

42:34.902 --> 42:36.842
Where would he go?

42:37.836 --> 42:39.766
I was talkin' to
the lawyer yesterday

42:39.872 --> 42:41.811
and I wanna sue for
wrongful arrest,

42:41.907 --> 42:43.776
but the lawyer says
to concentrate on

42:43.874 --> 42:45.604
one thing at a time.

42:47.310 --> 42:50.319
- Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.

42:50.412 --> 42:52.071
- Maybe it's best if I
wasn't around anymore.

42:52.179 --> 42:53.549
- Stop talkin' nonsense.

42:53.647 --> 42:56.356
- I think I should stay
up at the cabin full time.

42:56.449 --> 43:00.618
- Lord. One just come outta
jail and another one goin' in.

43:13.793 --> 43:14.853
- Hey, Owen.

43:14.962 --> 43:16.071
Yep.

43:16.762 --> 43:18.062
- About New Year's...

43:18.164 --> 43:21.992
- Pam, please. Water under
the bridge, honestly.

43:23.634 --> 43:24.863
- It's been a while.

43:24.968 --> 43:27.278
Who's been cuttin' your hair?

43:27.370 --> 43:28.999
- I've just been
goin' to Quick cuts.

43:29.104 --> 43:30.973
- I've got some time, I can
give you like a quick trim.

43:31.072 --> 43:35.011
- Pam, I don't think
that's a good idea.

43:35.108 --> 43:38.407
We were pretty toxic for
each other last time around.

43:39.710 --> 43:42.779
- Just make sure there's
lots of diet sodas in there.

43:42.879 --> 43:44.079
- I will.

43:44.181 --> 43:44.921
- 'Cause you know I
drink them like water.

43:45.015 --> 43:46.344
- I know.

43:46.449 --> 43:48.388
- Except that's
just an expression

43:48.483 --> 43:49.883
because I hate water.

43:49.985 --> 43:52.254
Can't stand the taste of it.

43:52.353 --> 43:53.623
- Water doesn't have any taste.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.179
- That's what
I hate about it.

43:55.288 --> 43:58.257
Except, I don't really like
the taste of diet soda either.

43:58.357 --> 43:59.667
- Really?

43:59.758 --> 44:02.057
- Yeah. I just drink it
because it's low in calories.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.589
Leaves an awful aftertaste.

44:03.693 --> 44:06.902
Kinda like a squirrel just
took a shit in your mouth.

44:08.830 --> 44:10.529
You wanna haircut?

44:10.631 --> 44:11.871
- Ah...

44:11.966 --> 44:13.136
- No.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.269
- Yeah.

44:15.368 --> 44:17.608
- Victor can you
help me out please?

44:17.703 --> 44:20.602
- I don't know, Owen.
Hair's kinda gettin' unruly.

44:20.705 --> 44:22.204
Now!

44:24.975 --> 44:27.314
- I'll just take a raincheck.

44:27.409 --> 44:28.869
- Yeah, next time.

44:28.978 --> 44:31.007
I'm here.

44:31.112 --> 44:32.582
- So, what
happened with you guys?

44:32.680 --> 44:34.549
Somethin' happen on New Year's?

44:34.647 --> 44:35.647
- Yeah, we broke up.

44:35.747 --> 44:36.977
It was bad.

44:37.083 --> 44:38.682
You didn't sense a lot
of tension back there?

44:38.783 --> 44:40.253
- No, I didn't feel the tension.

44:40.351 --> 44:42.320
The only tension I felt was
from you cock-blockin' my ass.

44:42.419 --> 44:44.918
- Well, what are you
talkin' about she's my ex.

44:45.021 --> 44:48.090
- So. She wanted it bro.

44:48.190 --> 44:50.959
All I'm sayin' is you
been cock-blocking

44:51.058 --> 44:52.128
me all over town, man.

44:52.226 --> 44:53.665
- I'm cock-blocking you?

44:53.759 --> 44:55.059
- Yeah, tellin' people that
I didn't go to real prison.

44:55.161 --> 44:55.821
You don't think I
heard about that?

44:55.928 --> 44:57.137
- You didn't.

44:57.229 --> 44:58.159
- You're fuckin' with
my street cred, bro.

44:58.263 --> 44:59.732
- You didn't go to real prison.

44:59.830 --> 45:01.430
You're a computer hacker.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.431
- You know what?

45:02.532 --> 45:03.932
How would you feel
if I told people,

45:04.034 --> 45:05.803
yeah you know what,
I'm workin' for Owen,

45:05.901 --> 45:08.141
but it's not a real business.

45:08.237 --> 45:10.906
He just stocks
machines with candy.

45:11.006 --> 45:13.975
- But you're not really working.

45:14.074 --> 45:16.403
Did you remember the
keys for the machine?

45:16.509 --> 45:18.448
- Yeah.
Yeah, I got the keys.

45:20.045 --> 45:21.814
- You mean these keys?

45:21.912 --> 45:22.842
Exactly.

45:22.946 --> 45:24.145
- You know what?

45:24.247 --> 45:25.317
You don't have to treat
me like a kid, Owen.

45:25.415 --> 45:27.314
- Why don't you stop
acting like one?

45:28.050 --> 45:29.519
Go see your mother.

45:29.617 --> 45:31.277
What's wrong with you?

45:33.053 --> 45:35.952
- I don't wanna
talk about it, man.

45:48.997 --> 45:50.836
I know. I know.

45:50.931 --> 45:52.191
I'm just finishin' up.

45:52.299 --> 45:54.168
- I'm serious
Owen, don't forget.

45:54.267 --> 45:57.376
He's excited. He has a
new hat and everything.

45:58.103 --> 45:59.772
- Yeah, okay.

45:59.870 --> 46:01.040
I'll be there don't worry.

46:01.139 --> 46:03.238
- I'm
counting on you.

46:06.542 --> 46:08.411
- Oh, hi Vera.

46:09.044 --> 46:10.004
Fancy meeting you here.

46:10.111 --> 46:11.280
- Oh hi, Owen.

46:11.378 --> 46:15.317
Owen, this is Tim.
Tim. Owen. Owen. Tim.

46:15.881 --> 46:17.850
- Hey, you Tim Kim?

46:17.949 --> 46:19.289
- Yes, I am.

46:19.384 --> 46:21.183
- You're that real
estate mogul guy, right?

46:21.285 --> 46:23.854
Yeah, I've seen your face
on the back of buses.

46:23.953 --> 46:25.422
- Best money I've spent.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.650
- I bet.

46:26.755 --> 46:30.294
- So, Owen you're here
to knock some pins down?

46:30.391 --> 46:32.990
- Yeah, it's my
favorite pastime.

46:33.093 --> 46:35.592
- It's my first time with
the duck pins, you know.

46:35.694 --> 46:37.104
Don't hold it against me, Ver.

46:37.196 --> 46:39.965
- Well, you'll get used to
the small balls in no time.

46:40.065 --> 46:42.264
Isn't that right, Ver?

46:42.366 --> 46:45.095
- Yeah, it doesn't take
long to get the hang of it.

46:45.201 --> 46:47.240
- I'm not much of a bowler.

46:53.106 --> 46:56.915
- Okay, well. I'll let
you two do your thing.

46:57.008 --> 46:58.467
- Go. You're up.

47:08.349 --> 47:09.819
- Don't worry Tim Kim.

47:09.916 --> 47:13.115
Just leaves you the opportunity
for a more impressive spare.

47:21.791 --> 47:22.691
Or not.

47:22.792 --> 47:24.818
Next time.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.736
You're doin' good.

47:32.732 --> 47:33.931
Go ahead.

47:34.032 --> 47:35.232
- Yeah, I don't know Vera.

47:35.334 --> 47:37.273
It's been a long
time since I bowled.

47:37.368 --> 47:40.207
I'm not sure I'm ready to
get back out there yet.

47:40.304 --> 47:41.834
You know what I mean?

47:41.938 --> 47:43.777
- Don't be a jerk.

47:46.841 --> 47:48.271
Ooo!

47:48.376 --> 47:49.115
- That's okay, baby.
- That's a tough spare.

47:49.210 --> 47:50.540
Next one.

47:53.613 --> 47:55.582
Oh, nice one Owen!

47:56.915 --> 47:58.754
- Lucky roll, Tim Kim.

48:12.391 --> 48:13.831
You know what? I like him.

48:13.926 --> 48:15.655
- Yeah. He's a nice guy.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.970
- Nice guy, yeah.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.490
Yeah, that's exactly
what I would call him.

48:18.595 --> 48:19.595
A nice guy.

48:19.696 --> 48:21.095
- I'm not so sure I
like this side of you.

48:21.197 --> 48:22.267
- I'm not sure I like
the woman I'm dating

48:22.365 --> 48:23.965
gallivanting around
with other men.

48:24.065 --> 48:25.135
- Gallivanting around. Wow.

48:25.234 --> 48:26.634
You know who you
remind of right now?

48:26.735 --> 48:28.104
Martin.

48:28.202 --> 48:29.442
- Well, I guess he's a better
guy than I thought then.

48:29.537 --> 48:31.696
- No, he's not, but I
thought that you were.

48:33.605 --> 48:34.535
- What?

48:34.640 --> 48:36.139
- I thought that you
understood. Yeah.

48:36.807 --> 48:37.977
Hey! No!

48:38.075 --> 48:39.704
I am not ready for
anything serious.

48:39.809 --> 48:41.349
- Obviously.

48:45.847 --> 48:47.217
Vera!

48:51.016 --> 48:53.156
- Thanks. Good job.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.999
- Long
look in at the plate.

49:16.100 --> 49:17.939
And here's the pitch.

49:18.034 --> 49:19.004
And there's a slow
roller to third.

49:19.102 --> 49:20.501
The third baseman charges.

49:20.603 --> 49:23.742
It's gonna be tight,
and he got him at first.

49:23.838 --> 49:25.898
Hey, champ.

49:26.007 --> 49:27.246
C'mon buddy, hop in
we can still make

49:27.341 --> 49:28.911
the fourth and fifth inning.

49:29.009 --> 49:30.338
Let's go.

49:32.944 --> 49:34.154
- Have you been drinking?

49:34.246 --> 49:35.745
Should you even be
driving right now?

49:35.846 --> 49:37.316
- No, I'm fine.

49:43.952 --> 49:45.711
Sorry, man.

49:46.888 --> 49:49.327
I ran into Vera. We broke up.

49:50.790 --> 49:52.050
I lost track of time.

49:52.158 --> 49:53.727
- I liked her.

49:53.825 --> 49:54.995
Yeah, I like -

49:55.093 --> 49:57.492
I liked her too. Hey! Adam!

50:00.997 --> 50:02.226
I'm sorry!

50:52.631 --> 50:54.231
- Mr. Wheeler?

50:54.899 --> 50:56.268
Hey, Todd.

50:57.835 --> 50:59.134
- Owen.

50:59.236 --> 51:01.265
- Door was
open, everything okay?

51:01.370 --> 51:03.270
- Yeah, I guess.

51:04.305 --> 51:06.005
- You need anything?

51:06.106 --> 51:08.175
- No. Thanks.

51:08.808 --> 51:09.948
- All right.

51:10.976 --> 51:11.876
- Owen.

51:11.977 --> 51:12.877
- Yep?

51:12.978 --> 51:14.017
- Hey, if you have a moment

51:14.111 --> 51:15.941
can you please,
can you come here?

51:16.046 --> 51:17.616
- Yeah, of course.

51:22.016 --> 51:23.386
Oh shit.

51:24.253 --> 51:26.452
Mr. Wheeler?

51:26.554 --> 51:30.193
- Unless you have a fetish
for touching dead people,

51:30.290 --> 51:32.689
I think you're
wasting your time.

51:32.791 --> 51:33.790
- What happened?

51:33.891 --> 51:37.260
- Well, he fell, and
then he looked around,

51:37.961 --> 51:39.730
simply petrified.

51:41.530 --> 51:45.199
Then he yelled out, "Oh
yeah! Well fuck you!"

51:46.199 --> 51:47.639
Then he was gone.

51:47.734 --> 51:50.303
Who do you think
he was talking to?

51:51.103 --> 51:53.202
- Sure he wasn't talkin' to you?

51:53.305 --> 51:56.174
- No, any other
time that would make

51:56.274 --> 51:58.243
a great point, but no.

51:58.341 --> 51:59.611
I saw he was locked in
a battle with someone

51:59.709 --> 52:03.477
that you and I would say
is not of this world.

52:07.814 --> 52:10.313
I guess we have that
to look forward to.

52:13.050 --> 52:14.720
- I should call Angie.

52:14.819 --> 52:18.727
- No. No, no,
please, please. Please.

52:18.821 --> 52:23.460
You know, can we just sit
here for a moment, okay?

52:24.525 --> 52:25.765
- Yeah.

52:26.694 --> 52:28.833
Yeah, okay.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.999
How you holdin' up?

52:49.108 --> 52:50.818
I'm fine.

52:52.043 --> 52:53.683
- Really?

52:55.379 --> 52:58.678
- The man they buried last
week was not my father.

52:58.781 --> 52:59.920
- What do you mean?

53:00.015 --> 53:03.344
- My mom left us to get
away from my dad's drinking.

53:03.451 --> 53:06.290
He actually quit when she left.

53:06.386 --> 53:09.255
Sober around 11 or 12 years.

53:09.355 --> 53:11.355
- Why did he start again?

53:12.156 --> 53:14.456
- The death of his mother.

53:14.558 --> 53:16.928
When she passed, it was
like he took one step

53:17.027 --> 53:18.966
into the grave with her.

53:20.363 --> 53:22.962
And it took everything we had.

53:25.098 --> 53:27.167
Everything we had

53:27.266 --> 53:29.995
to give him something
to live for, you know.

53:31.337 --> 53:34.366
That and then, then
Todd's accident.

53:35.139 --> 53:36.738
I'd see him out at the bar

53:36.840 --> 53:39.279
and it's like he didn't
even recognize me.

53:39.942 --> 53:42.041
Like I wasn't even there.

53:43.745 --> 53:45.814
Now, that was the
death of my father.

53:45.912 --> 53:49.651
They just waited this long to
put his body in the ground.

53:49.749 --> 53:53.207
I don't even know what I'm gonna
do with his place you know.

53:53.317 --> 53:55.347
- You're not gonna stay here?

53:55.453 --> 53:56.722
- I think I'm gonna sell it.

53:56.819 --> 53:58.049
We're actually
looking for a couple

53:58.154 --> 53:59.623
of facilities that
might take Todd.

53:59.721 --> 54:00.721
- What?

54:00.822 --> 54:01.822
- Yeah.

54:01.923 --> 54:03.462
- Why don't you just
both move in with me?

54:03.558 --> 54:05.257
You can't put Todd
in a facility.

54:05.359 --> 54:06.259
That's crazy.

54:06.360 --> 54:07.760
- Ownen, I appreciate that.

54:07.861 --> 54:10.600
But Todd's not just a plant
that needs watering, okay?

54:10.696 --> 54:13.165
There are actual classes
that you have to take

54:13.264 --> 54:15.733
before I can leave
you in charge of him.

54:15.832 --> 54:16.831
Classes.

54:19.901 --> 54:21.071
- I'll take them.

54:23.203 --> 54:24.943
I'll take the classes.

54:25.872 --> 54:27.972
I'm serious.

54:28.074 --> 54:30.383
He can move into the
bedroom on the first floor.

54:30.476 --> 54:32.235
You take my parents' room.

54:32.343 --> 54:34.453
My mother would hate
for it to go to waste.

54:34.545 --> 54:36.444
I'll put a ramp at the doorstep,

54:36.546 --> 54:39.585
and I'll even make the
van wheelchair accessible.

54:42.216 --> 54:43.955
- You'd do that for us?

54:45.919 --> 54:48.428
- Yeah.

54:48.521 --> 54:51.990
- Your house is really turnin'
into a refuge for strays.

54:53.891 --> 54:56.460
- I'm just tired of
livin' alone, that's all.

55:00.061 --> 55:01.330
Dear Jen,

55:01.429 --> 55:02.999
You remember when I turned 12?

55:03.097 --> 55:04.826
I found my birthday
cake in the freezer,

55:04.931 --> 55:08.640
and I finished half of it
before my party even began.

55:08.734 --> 55:11.733
I just had to have
it all to myself.

55:11.836 --> 55:14.505
And then I was throwing up
for the rest of the day.

55:14.605 --> 55:17.104
And Mom had to cancel my party.

55:19.173 --> 55:22.112
Why do I always have to
fuck up a good thing?

55:29.415 --> 55:31.374
Hey, Owen.

55:31.916 --> 55:33.146
Martin.

55:33.250 --> 55:35.119
- Sorry, about
hittin' ya that night.

55:35.218 --> 55:37.117
I was pretty drunk.

55:39.455 --> 55:41.024
- It's okay.

55:41.122 --> 55:42.182
- Good.

55:42.289 --> 55:43.898
So, you and Vera still...

55:43.990 --> 55:45.050
- No.

55:46.058 --> 55:46.798
Really?

55:46.892 --> 55:47.692
- Yeah.

55:47.793 --> 55:50.392
Haven't seen her in a while.

55:50.495 --> 55:51.894
- Not that it's
any of my business,

55:51.995 --> 55:53.035
but you know a couple -

55:53.130 --> 55:54.100
- It is none of your business.

55:54.197 --> 55:55.296
I'm gonna get back to work.

55:55.398 --> 55:56.698
- Hey, don't be
turnin' your back on me

55:56.799 --> 55:58.198
while I'm trying to
talk to you, all right.

55:58.299 --> 56:00.499
Unless you wanna get hit again.

56:03.037 --> 56:04.006
- Hey! You -

56:11.576 --> 56:14.845
- You can't be
serious right now.

56:16.078 --> 56:18.148
I'm gonna break the other arm.

56:20.782 --> 56:23.051
- Did you hear Max
is gettin' out of the Navy?

56:23.150 --> 56:25.149
No, I didn't.

56:25.251 --> 56:27.290
- Throwin' a party for him.

56:27.385 --> 56:29.045
I know he'd be pretty
happy to see ya.

56:29.154 --> 56:31.123
- Yeah, can't make it.

56:31.221 --> 56:33.660
- I didn't even tell
you when it was.

56:34.858 --> 56:37.797
- How long are you gonna
hold a grudge against me?

56:39.127 --> 56:40.966
- You slept with my girlfriend.

56:41.062 --> 56:42.491
- You slept with my cousin.

56:42.596 --> 56:44.266
- It's not the same thing.

56:44.364 --> 56:45.863
Plus, I fell off the
roof at your party,

56:45.965 --> 56:48.904
and I think somebody should've
gone to the hospital with me.

56:50.835 --> 56:54.243
- Yeah, but it was
a really good party.

56:54.336 --> 56:55.466
Dude.

56:55.572 --> 56:56.812
- Look, I haven't
seen Pam in months.

56:56.906 --> 56:58.335
And who told you to go
up on my roof, anyway.

56:58.440 --> 56:59.979
I mean, you're lucky
you just broke your arm,

57:00.074 --> 57:01.274
and not your damn...

57:01.375 --> 57:02.805
Your...

57:02.909 --> 57:04.279
That you didn't
get hurt any worse.

57:04.377 --> 57:05.307
Who's your friend?

57:05.411 --> 57:06.950
Angie's brother Todd.

57:07.045 --> 57:08.775
- Todd Wheeler?

57:08.880 --> 57:09.790
Yep.

57:09.881 --> 57:13.110
- Shit, Todd. I
didn't recognize you.

57:13.216 --> 57:15.155
Somebody told me you were dead.

57:15.250 --> 57:16.480
Motorcycle accident.

57:16.586 --> 57:18.155
- I did have a
motorcycle accident.

57:18.252 --> 57:19.892
And I did die.

57:19.988 --> 57:22.047
- Well, you must be what?
Like a hundred pounds lighter

57:22.155 --> 57:23.425
than you used to be?

57:23.524 --> 57:25.593
- No, we dead don't worry
about what we weigh.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.991
As you might imagine that
we have very few concerns

57:28.093 --> 57:29.762
at all.

57:29.860 --> 57:31.560
- Why does he keep
sayin' he's dead?

57:31.662 --> 57:32.601
- I don't know, Pete.

57:32.696 --> 57:34.126
Why don't you ask him yourself?

57:34.230 --> 57:35.599
- Jesus.

57:35.698 --> 57:37.868
He used to scare the shit
out of me in high school.

57:37.966 --> 57:39.935
Plus you used to shake
me down for lunch money,

57:40.034 --> 57:41.164
like once a week.

57:41.268 --> 57:43.577
- As it happens, I have your
money in my back pocket.

57:43.670 --> 57:45.799
Would you like me to get it?

57:47.606 --> 57:49.816
Except for the
uncontrollable spasms,

57:49.908 --> 57:52.567
I'm completely
immobile below my neck.

57:52.676 --> 57:54.485
If that's not
dead, then what is?

57:54.577 --> 57:56.207
- You still got your
brain, don't you?

57:56.311 --> 57:58.681
- You ever read the Bible, Pete?

57:58.780 --> 58:00.279
- Yeah, I've heard of it.

58:00.380 --> 58:02.519
- God has chosen
me, and rightly so,

58:02.616 --> 58:03.986
for an eternity of hell.

58:04.083 --> 58:07.582
He cleverly gave me a few
years of hell on Earth

58:07.686 --> 58:11.454
strapped to this chair
before the real hell begins.

58:11.555 --> 58:14.694
It's almost flattering
if you think about it.

59:09.861 --> 59:10.990
- You better make
sure that meets

59:11.094 --> 59:13.294
county regulation
requirements, Owen.

59:13.395 --> 59:15.635
I wouldn't want
to slip and fall.

59:16.665 --> 59:18.165
- Okay, boss.

59:19.800 --> 59:23.429
- C'mon, man. We got
a playoff game this Saturday.

59:23.536 --> 59:24.766
All right... we're gonna
work on grounders.

59:24.871 --> 59:27.410
Look alive out
there! Look alive!

59:27.505 --> 59:31.603
Gotta be ready for anything.

59:31.708 --> 59:34.048
There you go! Run it
down! Run it down!

59:34.142 --> 59:35.742
Where's the shortstop at?!

59:35.844 --> 59:37.713
You gotta be on that!

59:37.812 --> 59:39.842
This time, runner's on first.

59:39.947 --> 59:41.046
I want two outs.

59:41.147 --> 59:42.647
Here we go!

59:47.418 --> 59:48.778
Adam!

59:48.887 --> 59:50.026
Come here!

59:53.455 --> 59:55.924
What's goin' on with
you out there today?

59:56.024 --> 59:58.963
- It's the new shortstop,
she smells good.

01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:05.092
Well, all right.

01:00:05.197 --> 01:00:07.036
Get back out there then.

01:00:09.866 --> 01:00:12.466
All right, rundown drills!

01:00:12.569 --> 01:00:15.208
Man on second, place
between second and third.

01:00:15.304 --> 01:00:16.873
Here we go!

01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:20.767
Perfect!

01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:23.979
Perfect.

01:00:25.677 --> 01:00:27.177
Hey Vera.

01:00:28.278 --> 01:00:29.678
Wow, you look -

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.219
- What are you doin' here?

01:00:31.314 --> 01:00:33.743
- Well, I found that crab
you threw back in the bay,

01:00:33.849 --> 01:00:35.449
and some of his buddies,

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.019
at the supermarket
of all places.

01:00:38.119 --> 01:00:39.588
Wanna have dinner?

01:00:39.686 --> 01:00:41.056
- Now, is not a good time.

01:00:41.154 --> 01:00:42.423
- Ooo, I love crabs.

01:00:42.521 --> 01:00:43.691
- Are you guys back together?

01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:45.189
- Oh no, we're trying -

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:47.089
- Honey, we're gonna be late.

01:00:47.191 --> 01:00:48.091
We're going -

01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:48.961
- Excuse me.

01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:49.959
- No, Owen.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.559
- No, this'll only
take a second.

01:00:51.661 --> 01:00:53.701
- Okay. You
have misunderstood.

01:00:53.796 --> 01:00:54.925
Oh yeah, did I?

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.900
I misunderstood?

01:00:55.997 --> 01:00:56.557
Yeah.

01:00:56.665 --> 01:00:57.564
What are you doing?

01:00:57.665 --> 01:00:58.795
Load up on these.

01:00:58.899 --> 01:00:59.699
- Okay.

01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:01.369
- Thirsty there, Owen?

01:01:01.467 --> 01:01:02.567
- Yeah, parched.

01:01:02.669 --> 01:01:03.808
- Go and start
the car, please.

01:01:03.902 --> 01:01:04.962
Just go.

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:06.109
What is this?

01:01:06.203 --> 01:01:08.073
- I don't want him
drinkin' my waters

01:01:08.172 --> 01:01:10.041
after you guys have sex.

01:01:10.506 --> 01:01:11.975
- What?

01:01:12.074 --> 01:01:14.973
No, I'm not having
sex with Martin.

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.540
- What?

01:01:17.646 --> 01:01:19.385
- It's his grandmother's
75th birthday,

01:01:19.479 --> 01:01:20.409
and I like her.

01:01:20.513 --> 01:01:22.812
So, I'm gonna go to the party.

01:01:23.449 --> 01:01:25.218
We're not back together.

01:01:28.585 --> 01:01:29.445
- Shit.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.292
- You dropped the bottles.

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:31.986
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:01:32.988 --> 01:01:35.258
Okay.

01:01:35.357 --> 01:01:38.256
Well, at least I'm consistent
at being an asshole.

01:01:39.292 --> 01:01:41.092
- Fairly, yeah.

01:01:41.194 --> 01:01:43.993
- Look, Vera. This
was not the plan.

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:47.729
I know you have to
see other people,

01:01:47.831 --> 01:01:49.871
I know you need time.

01:01:50.633 --> 01:01:52.733
I wanna be with you.

01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:55.774
Adam, he really likes you.

01:01:55.871 --> 01:01:58.710
He really likes me
when I'm with you.

01:01:58.806 --> 01:02:02.275
I really like me
when I'm with you.

01:02:02.374 --> 01:02:04.174
- I'm not dating anyone.

01:02:04.276 --> 01:02:05.745
I've been alone for months,

01:02:05.843 --> 01:02:09.072
and I'm okay with that.

01:02:12.682 --> 01:02:15.181
But I like me when
I'm with you, too.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.821
And that scares me.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.989
- I know, I'm scared too.

01:02:21.087 --> 01:02:22.987
Hey, we still going?

01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:24.058
- Yeah.

01:02:24.155 --> 01:02:25.155
I'm sorry.

01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:27.660
I should go.

01:02:27.758 --> 01:02:28.658
You guys, this was
totally inappropriate.

01:02:28.759 --> 01:02:31.228
- No, we're going. You stay.

01:02:33.762 --> 01:02:36.191
You can't catch them but
maybe you can cook them,

01:02:36.297 --> 01:02:38.736
and I'll be back in an hour?

01:02:39.132 --> 01:02:40.202
- Yeah?

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.299
- Yeah.

01:02:42.434 --> 01:02:43.704
Yeah.

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.402
What? Really?

01:02:45.503 --> 01:02:47.002
- Yeah.

01:02:48.038 --> 01:02:49.268
Come on.

01:02:49.372 --> 01:02:50.871
You'll get over it.

01:02:52.408 --> 01:02:54.277
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:02:57.111 --> 01:02:58.181
Oh shit.

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:13.624
- Well, you can
reopen when this is over.

01:03:13.722 --> 01:03:15.022
- Why?

01:03:15.123 --> 01:03:18.762
It's just gonna be another
kid with another brick.

01:03:18.859 --> 01:03:21.788
I was doing half my
business online anyway.

01:03:21.894 --> 01:03:23.333
- Sounds pretty good, I guess.

01:03:23.428 --> 01:03:25.757
- Nice havin' a place
to go everyday, you know?

01:03:25.863 --> 01:03:28.173
Made me feel like I was
still a part of things.

01:03:28.265 --> 01:03:30.834
No, no you're gonna
hurt yourself.

01:03:30.934 --> 01:03:33.433
There's a hand
truck in the back.

01:03:33.535 --> 01:03:34.964
- Oh.

01:03:47.945 --> 01:03:50.854
- Trust me, you
won't be disappointed.

01:03:56.216 --> 01:03:57.586
- It's so sour.

01:03:57.684 --> 01:03:58.983
- Your face.

01:04:00.787 --> 01:04:02.886
- Adam. What are you doin' here?

01:04:02.988 --> 01:04:04.187
- Mom's shopping
across the street,

01:04:04.288 --> 01:04:05.928
and I wanted to come
say hi to Uncle Kenny.

01:04:06.023 --> 01:04:07.852
- You should go back
and help your mother.

01:04:07.958 --> 01:04:09.128
- Ah, he's not in the way.

01:04:09.225 --> 01:04:10.824
- Kenny, there's broken
glass everywhere,

01:04:10.926 --> 01:04:12.696
and we don't know how long
we're gonna here, all right.

01:04:12.794 --> 01:04:14.994
We've got work to do.

01:04:15.096 --> 01:04:16.835
- Hey, you wanna go
fishin' with us later?

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:18.200
- Can I Dad? That'd be awesome.

01:04:18.298 --> 01:04:20.097
- No! Adam, c'mon.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.729
You should be helpin'
out your mother.

01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:23.974
Let's go.

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:25.238
C'mon.

01:04:27.004 --> 01:04:28.963
- See ya later, Uncle Kenny.

01:04:29.072 --> 01:04:30.711
- You bet.

01:04:36.777 --> 01:04:38.647
Dear Jen,

01:04:38.745 --> 01:04:40.914
I always looked up to Kenny.

01:04:41.013 --> 01:04:42.542
He did well in school.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:44.156
Had his own business.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:46.177
He always seemed to be headed
in the right direction,

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:47.423
you know.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.946
And now this.

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:52.718
There's no way, I mean...

01:04:53.488 --> 01:04:55.957
It's just not possible, right?

01:04:57.824 --> 01:05:00.553
God, I could really
use a drink right now.

01:05:00.658 --> 01:05:04.267
- So, I was thinkin' maybe
I just show up in San Diego

01:05:04.361 --> 01:05:09.189
with a surfboard in one hand
and a Mai Tai in the other.

01:05:09.298 --> 01:05:13.137
Be worth it just to see the
look on Cindy's face, you know?

01:05:15.035 --> 01:05:16.205
Kenny?

01:05:17.104 --> 01:05:17.844
Kenny.

01:05:17.938 --> 01:05:20.507
- What? Yeah. Yeah, right.

01:05:21.739 --> 01:05:23.909
- Where you at right now, man?

01:05:24.008 --> 01:05:26.408
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:05:30.846 --> 01:05:32.176
- Listen...

01:05:34.148 --> 01:05:37.617
I don't want you comin'
to the courthouse.

01:05:37.717 --> 01:05:39.826
If this does go to trial.

01:05:39.919 --> 01:05:41.718
- What are your lawyers saying?

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.889
- In the beginning, he
said that, you know,

01:05:44.988 --> 01:05:46.548
that they had nothin',
but now he's saying

01:05:46.656 --> 01:05:48.925
that I should try
and make a deal.

01:05:52.693 --> 01:05:54.532
- What's Aunt Claire say?

01:05:55.295 --> 01:05:56.794
- She...

01:05:59.697 --> 01:06:02.037
wishes I was dead.

01:06:02.134 --> 01:06:04.803
- C'mon, she doesn't
wish you were dead.

01:06:06.769 --> 01:06:08.209
- She thinks I did it.

01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:15.346
You think I did it.

01:06:15.442 --> 01:06:18.241
- I wouldn't be here
if I thought that.

01:06:20.012 --> 01:06:22.881
- You keep Adam away
from me, like...

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:27.988
Like I was gonna eat him alive.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.283
- I keep him away
because I promised Cindy

01:06:30.385 --> 01:06:33.054
I would until all
of this blows over.

01:06:35.221 --> 01:06:37.791
- How was I supposed
to know that?

01:06:39.091 --> 01:06:41.360
- You should've told me that.

01:06:41.459 --> 01:06:44.028
- You're right I'm
sorry. I should've.

01:06:56.635 --> 01:06:59.134
- I got no one, man.

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:05.004
I mean, my own
brother won't even

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:07.977
be in the same room
as me, you know.

01:07:14.848 --> 01:07:16.807
- It's gonna be okay.

01:07:22.187 --> 01:07:25.086
- You know man, I
don't think you're taciturn.

01:07:25.189 --> 01:07:27.128
I don't think that
describes you.

01:07:27.223 --> 01:07:27.953
- What?

01:07:28.057 --> 01:07:29.786
- You know, I think you're more,

01:07:29.892 --> 01:07:32.121
you're more truculent,
if anything.

01:07:32.226 --> 01:07:34.266
- Well, somebody
found a thesaurus.

01:07:34.995 --> 01:07:36.265
- Hey you know what?

01:07:36.362 --> 01:07:38.761
You know what your
real problem is?

01:07:38.864 --> 01:07:40.663
- Tell me Victor,
what's my problem?

01:07:40.764 --> 01:07:42.204
- You're not curious enough.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.869
You know, I mean, you'll talk
if I say something to you,

01:07:43.967 --> 01:07:45.797
but you won't ask
me any questions.

01:07:45.903 --> 01:07:48.172
- What do you want
me to ask you?

01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:50.039
- What are my plans
for the future?

01:07:50.138 --> 01:07:51.838
Do I believe in God or not?

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.409
What are my likes and dislikes?

01:07:53.507 --> 01:07:54.807
- What?

01:07:54.909 --> 01:07:56.478
- Okay, for example, did
you know that I don't

01:07:56.575 --> 01:07:58.204
like left-handed people?

01:07:58.310 --> 01:07:59.980
- Do I need to
know such a thing?

01:08:00.078 --> 01:08:02.217
- I used to be left-handed.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:04.185
- Sorry.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.080
Also, I don't know
why, but I can't stand

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.881
people with fiery red hair.

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:09.483
Male or female.

01:08:09.584 --> 01:08:11.483
- Dickhead. I have red hair.

01:08:11.585 --> 01:08:14.094
- It's not fiery, it's more
auburn. So, we're cool.

01:08:14.187 --> 01:08:17.856
- Okay, so when you say
that I'm not curious,

01:08:17.957 --> 01:08:19.616
are you talking about I'm
not curious about you,

01:08:19.724 --> 01:08:21.493
or the whole world in general?

01:08:21.591 --> 01:08:23.361
- Well, I mean, I think
this specific example

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:24.560
proves the general rule.

01:08:24.661 --> 01:08:25.800
I mean, let's not get technical.

01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:27.064
- I don't ask Todd
here about himself.

01:08:27.162 --> 01:08:28.792
You don't see him
cryin' about it.

01:08:28.897 --> 01:08:31.866
- Okay, all right. Wait
a second. Wait a second.

01:08:31.966 --> 01:08:34.135
First of all, I'm not cryin'.

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.134
And second of all, don't
bring Todd into this.

01:08:36.236 --> 01:08:38.675
- Okay, so you want me to
ask you some questions?

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:39.769
- Yeah.

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.000
- Okay.

01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:43.301
Your brother's about
to go to trial,

01:08:43.406 --> 01:08:46.545
are you gonna come to court
with me everyday in support?

01:08:46.642 --> 01:08:48.142
Here's another question, Vic.

01:08:48.243 --> 01:08:50.053
How is it that you
haven't seen Aunt Claire

01:08:50.145 --> 01:08:52.404
once since you've been back?

01:08:52.511 --> 01:08:54.022
- I asked you not
to talk about this.

01:08:54.113 --> 01:08:55.573
- Oh yeah, you
don't wanna talk about it.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.051
No, no, no. You wanna sit around

01:08:57.149 --> 01:09:00.718
and tell me all about your
likes and your dislikes,

01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:02.317
like we're 13 year old girls,

01:09:02.419 --> 01:09:04.228
but I ask you a
simple question like,

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:07.519
how you could turn your
back on your only brother?

01:09:07.622 --> 01:09:09.591
And you got nothin' to say.

01:09:11.259 --> 01:09:13.218
Exactly.

01:09:13.326 --> 01:09:15.036
- Todd, you need to
go to the restroom?

01:09:15.127 --> 01:09:16.926
All right, I'll take
you to the restroom.

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.698
Hey Owen, Todd needs
to go to the restroom,

01:09:19.796 --> 01:09:20.827
I need some help.

01:09:20.932 --> 01:09:22.270
- What?

01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:24.295
- In the restroom, with
Todd, going to the bathroom.

01:09:25.801 --> 01:09:26.970
- He doesn't go to the bathroom.

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.738
- I need to fuckin'
tell you somethin'.

01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:30.904
Come to the bathroom.

01:09:36.541 --> 01:09:37.611
- What?

01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:38.868
- I should've told
you this before.

01:09:38.977 --> 01:09:40.087
- You and Kenny, growing
up, were so tight.

01:09:40.178 --> 01:09:41.377
I don't know what
the hell happened.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:42.837
- This isn't the first
time the golden boy

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.055
has done something like this.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:45.546
- What are you talking about?

01:09:45.647 --> 01:09:47.676
Carrie Maynard, Camp Seneca.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.622
I was a sophomore
in high school,

01:09:49.716 --> 01:09:51.086
we were camp counselors.

01:09:51.185 --> 01:09:53.045
Kenny was a senior.

01:09:53.153 --> 01:09:55.892
Carrie was in
eighth grade, Owen.

01:09:55.989 --> 01:09:58.458
Eighth grade. She
was 14 years old.

01:09:58.556 --> 01:10:00.925
And nothing ever came
of it because it was

01:10:01.025 --> 01:10:03.724
her word against
his, but I knew.

01:10:03.826 --> 01:10:04.826
- I never heard about this.

01:10:04.927 --> 01:10:06.166
- Jesus Christ, Owen.

01:10:06.261 --> 01:10:07.761
That's 'cause you think
if you give everybody

01:10:07.862 --> 01:10:09.361
a chance they're gonna
be a good person.

01:10:09.463 --> 01:10:11.562
You know, buy them a soda, talk
to them for a little while,

01:10:11.664 --> 01:10:14.234
send them on their way and
they're harmless as rabbits.

01:10:14.334 --> 01:10:16.833
But let me tell you
something, there are people

01:10:16.935 --> 01:10:18.804
whose heads are fucked up,

01:10:18.903 --> 01:10:22.812
and my brother is
definitely one of them.

01:10:22.906 --> 01:10:24.235
- Let's just get
back to work, please.

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.940
- You're not listening
to him, Owen.

01:10:26.042 --> 01:10:28.151
Be quiet and listen to him.

01:10:31.178 --> 01:10:32.717
- Owen, I've seen him.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:35.881
The way he looks at those
girls in the record store.

01:10:35.981 --> 01:10:38.350
I mean, what if you
were Kimmy's father?

01:10:38.449 --> 01:10:40.449
Or Carrie's?

01:10:40.551 --> 01:10:45.619
Or shit, what if someone did
something like this to Adam?

01:10:49.557 --> 01:10:53.026
- If this is true, you
know what you have to do.

01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:26.446
- I think it's
better if I go alone.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.448
- Why is it better?

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.819
- I don't know.

01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:31.985
But that's the way
we're gonna do it.

01:11:53.766 --> 01:11:56.535
- Hey, what's goin' on?

01:12:09.843 --> 01:12:11.582
What's up?

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:23.619
- You know, Adam's
gonna be 12 this year.

01:12:24.952 --> 01:12:27.582
- Yeah. I know.

01:12:27.689 --> 01:12:29.358
Can you believe it?

01:12:30.224 --> 01:12:32.353
I keep thinking about

01:12:36.027 --> 01:12:39.396
how I would feel if
somebody abused him.

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:45.069
Thinking about how
Kimmy's father must feel.

01:12:46.033 --> 01:12:47.803
Makes me sick.

01:12:50.604 --> 01:12:52.233
- Don't do this.

01:12:54.606 --> 01:12:57.775
You're the only one that
thinks I'm innocent, man.

01:12:58.809 --> 01:13:00.678
- Did you assault that girl?

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:06.538
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:13:07.848 --> 01:13:09.178
Kenny,

01:13:09.916 --> 01:13:12.485
did you assault that girl?

01:13:12.584 --> 01:13:14.424
- No.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.819
- You need to come
clean, right now.

01:13:19.456 --> 01:13:22.625
Vic, please just
wait in the van.

01:13:22.725 --> 01:13:24.924
- No, it's cool. It's cool.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.196
- What's he doin' here?

01:13:26.294 --> 01:13:29.563
- Oh, I told Owen
about Carrie Maynard.

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:31.590
- Who?

01:13:31.697 --> 01:13:33.796
- Victor, please.
I've got this, all right.

01:13:33.898 --> 01:13:34.908
Go wait in the van.

01:13:34.999 --> 01:13:38.328
- No, no, just give it a second.

01:13:38.436 --> 01:13:41.145
I'm sure Kenny remembers.

01:13:41.871 --> 01:13:44.640
- You're a fucking liar.

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.978
He's a liar. I never,
I never hurt that girl.

01:13:48.074 --> 01:13:51.843
- Oh, oh I'm a
fuckin' liar, huh?

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.114
Huh, Kenny?

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:55.712
- Where did you get that?

01:13:55.813 --> 01:13:56.743
What this?

01:13:56.848 --> 01:13:57.717
Yeah.

01:13:57.814 --> 01:13:59.883
- Oh, it's, it's Kenny's.

01:13:59.982 --> 01:14:02.212
Keeps it in the
back of his closet.

01:14:02.318 --> 01:14:04.287
Or am I lying about that too?

01:14:04.386 --> 01:14:07.555
Sometimes people
need a little help

01:14:07.655 --> 01:14:10.464
admitting they're
a child molester.

01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:13.861
- Get off me.

01:14:13.959 --> 01:14:15.128
Get off of me!

01:14:15.226 --> 01:14:16.786
Get off me!

01:14:16.894 --> 01:14:18.233
Get off me.

01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:23.301
- Tell the truth!

01:14:23.399 --> 01:14:24.598
Tell the truth, Kenny!

01:14:24.699 --> 01:14:25.999
Tell Owen what you did.

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.139
Tell him.

01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:28.304
- Fuck you!

01:14:28.402 --> 01:14:29.462
- No, no, no, no, Owen.

01:14:29.569 --> 01:14:30.879
He thinks these
girls are into him,

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:32.030
he thinks they're
flirting with him,

01:14:32.138 --> 01:14:33.277
and tries to make a move,

01:14:33.372 --> 01:14:34.372
and that's why they
freak out on him!

01:14:34.473 --> 01:14:35.972
Just go outside!

01:14:36.073 --> 01:14:36.873
Please!

01:14:36.974 --> 01:14:38.014
- He's fuckin' crazy!

01:14:38.108 --> 01:14:39.767
You're delusional
you know that?!

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:41.815
It's fuckin' rape! It's rape!

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.479
- Don't.

01:14:47.581 --> 01:14:50.590
Don't you dare use that word.

01:14:50.683 --> 01:14:54.152
She loves me so you
can't use that word.

01:14:59.222 --> 01:15:01.592
I don't know why all
this is happening?

01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:02.420
I just -

01:15:02.524 --> 01:15:05.463
Owen, I just need to see her.

01:15:05.559 --> 01:15:07.529
I just need to talk to her.

01:15:08.995 --> 01:15:10.605
See, it's her parents.

01:15:10.697 --> 01:15:12.626
It's her parents that
are doin' all this.

01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:13.901
She's not like this.

01:15:13.998 --> 01:15:15.198
She loves me, man.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.430
- She's 15.

01:15:16.534 --> 01:15:17.973
- See, Owen they're in love.

01:15:18.067 --> 01:15:20.636
- What part of you
thinks that's okay?

01:15:22.371 --> 01:15:24.710
- What are you judging me?

01:15:26.006 --> 01:15:28.646
You are the moral authority?

01:15:29.975 --> 01:15:31.615
It's 'cause you
think you've changed

01:15:31.711 --> 01:15:32.570
into Super Dad.

01:15:32.677 --> 01:15:34.347
But how long before
you fuck it up?!

01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:36.485
And turn into that same
drunk you've always been?!

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.909
- Don't you fuckin'
start with me!

01:15:38.014 --> 01:15:39.614
- Oh, you're gonna
beat me up now?!

01:15:39.716 --> 01:15:40.326
Gonna beat me up?

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:41.976
You gonna hit me?

01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:43.153
See, you haven't changed.

01:15:43.252 --> 01:15:44.591
You can pretend
that you've changed.

01:15:44.685 --> 01:15:46.884
Just like you're pretending
like all those people

01:15:46.986 --> 01:15:48.386
at your house are your family.

01:15:48.488 --> 01:15:50.887
They're your new
family, Owen! Huh?

01:15:50.989 --> 01:15:52.828
A fat chick and a gimp,

01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:53.924
and that fuck!

01:15:55.892 --> 01:15:56.952
They're not your family.

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.970
I'm your family.

01:15:58.061 --> 01:15:58.860
- You're my family, huh?

01:15:58.961 --> 01:15:59.921
Yeah.

01:16:00.029 --> 01:16:01.239
- You don't know what family is.

01:16:01.331 --> 01:16:02.560
- I trusted you.

01:16:02.664 --> 01:16:04.064
I stood by you!

01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:05.704
- You did not.

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:07.768
You pitied me.

01:16:07.867 --> 01:16:10.167
Fuck your pity!

01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.099
Go on, pretend that you're
so different from me,

01:16:12.204 --> 01:16:13.573
but you're not.

01:16:13.671 --> 01:16:15.141
Same blood that
flows through you

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.909
flows through me.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:23.473
- I'm nothing like you.

01:16:24.679 --> 01:16:25.648
Owen.

01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:27.246
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:16:27.348 --> 01:16:28.847
I'm sorry don't go.

01:16:28.948 --> 01:16:30.318
I'm sorry, I just miss her.

01:16:30.416 --> 01:16:31.455
I miss her.
- Stop!

01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:32.950
- I just need to
see her, please!

01:16:33.051 --> 01:16:33.711
No!

01:16:33.818 --> 01:16:34.727
No, don't go!

01:16:34.818 --> 01:16:36.048
Please!
- Get the fuck off me!

01:16:36.153 --> 01:16:37.952
- Owen! Owen, please!

01:16:38.054 --> 01:16:39.094
I don't wanna hit you.

01:16:39.188 --> 01:16:41.257
- Please,
Owen! Don't go!

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:45.388
Please, Owen.

01:16:50.596 --> 01:16:52.195
Owen!

01:16:58.434 --> 01:17:01.273
Wasn't supposed to be like this!

01:17:01.803 --> 01:17:03.633
Owen! Please!

01:19:02.983 --> 01:19:04.683
You guys okay?

01:19:04.785 --> 01:19:06.024
Yeah.

01:19:06.786 --> 01:19:07.856
Dad?

01:19:10.055 --> 01:19:11.694
- Yeah?

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:13.159
- You know the other
day when I came to see

01:19:13.257 --> 01:19:15.456
you and Uncle
Kenny at the store?

01:19:16.092 --> 01:19:17.361
- Yeah.

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.200
- I kind of...

01:19:19.294 --> 01:19:21.023
Well, I took some
lollipops without

01:19:21.128 --> 01:19:23.497
telling Uncle Kenny.

01:19:23.597 --> 01:19:24.597
Do you think maybe he knew

01:19:24.698 --> 01:19:25.668
and he was upset about it?

01:19:25.766 --> 01:19:27.405
Do you think that's why he did-

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.860
- No, no, no.

01:19:28.967 --> 01:19:31.437
I'm sure Uncle Kenny would've
wanted you to have them.

01:19:31.536 --> 01:19:32.905
- But then why did he do it?

01:19:33.003 --> 01:19:34.003
Why?
- Adam.

01:19:34.104 --> 01:19:35.773
It's...

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.778
There's people in this world
who are just really unhappy.

01:19:41.876 --> 01:19:45.705
It's like they, they
have so much pain inside

01:19:45.812 --> 01:19:48.881
of them that they don't
they'll ever be happy again.

01:19:48.981 --> 01:19:51.320
And so they make themselves
believe that the only way

01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:54.685
to end the hurt is
to leave this life.

01:19:55.851 --> 01:19:58.920
And I think Uncle Kenny
was one of those people.

01:20:03.391 --> 01:20:05.620
Unfortunately, there's
nothing that anyone

01:20:05.725 --> 01:20:08.734
could've said or done
to take his pain away.

01:20:08.827 --> 01:20:11.626
No one is responsible
for what he did.

01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:13.999
No one is to blame.

01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:16.970
Especially, not you. Okay?

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.970
- Okay.

01:20:19.067 --> 01:20:22.405
Sometimes I feel like
you're really unhappy too.

01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:33.040
- Well, I know that it might
seem like that sometimes.

01:20:34.144 --> 01:20:37.242
But I will never
do what Kenny did.

01:20:37.345 --> 01:20:40.254
I'll never leave
you like that, okay?

01:20:40.347 --> 01:20:42.947
I love you, all right?

01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:44.919
I love you too, Dad.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.209
Dear Jen,

01:21:19.306 --> 01:21:21.106
Mom always loved the fall

01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:22.547
when the wind was blowing,

01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:25.472
the leaves were all
turning different colors.

01:21:25.578 --> 01:21:28.817
All I could think of was
how the leaves were dying.

01:21:28.913 --> 01:21:32.012
But she thought it looked
like a shimmering fire.

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:34.619
You know what?

01:21:36.518 --> 01:21:38.518
They kinda do.

01:21:46.959 --> 01:21:48.928
- Adam! Hey!

01:21:49.794 --> 01:21:50.494
- Hey Dad.

01:21:50.595 --> 01:21:51.494
- How are ya?

01:21:51.595 --> 01:21:52.365
Good. How are you?

01:21:52.463 --> 01:21:53.793
- Good.

01:21:53.897 --> 01:21:54.736
Cindy.

01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:55.960
- Hey.

01:21:56.065 --> 01:21:57.904
- Look at this.

01:21:57.999 --> 01:21:58.859
You wanna gumball?

01:21:58.967 --> 01:22:00.506
Sure.

01:22:01.101 --> 01:22:02.631
- How about all of them?

01:22:02.736 --> 01:22:03.905
- What?

01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:05.273
Birthday gift.

01:22:05.371 --> 01:22:06.900
- Really? It's mine?

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.245
Yeah.

01:22:08.339 --> 01:22:09.708
I don't have much to
give in this world

01:22:09.807 --> 01:22:11.537
but it's better
than a pair of shoes

01:22:11.642 --> 01:22:13.911
that you'll grow out
of in three months.

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:14.910
- Thanks, Dad.

01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:16.010
Yeah.

01:22:16.111 --> 01:22:17.721
So, key goes in the top here

01:22:17.813 --> 01:22:20.272
that's where you
put the gumballs in.

01:22:20.381 --> 01:22:23.250
And then in the back,
just open it up,

01:22:23.349 --> 01:22:25.088
and that's where the money is.

01:22:35.191 --> 01:22:36.890
- Three dollars and 25 cents.

01:22:36.992 --> 01:22:37.992
Mm-hmm.

01:22:38.093 --> 01:22:39.162
- I get to keep this?

01:22:39.259 --> 01:22:41.129
- Sure do.

01:22:41.228 --> 01:22:42.597
I don't give you an allowance.

01:22:42.696 --> 01:22:45.665
So, I thought this
might be a nice way

01:22:45.764 --> 01:22:49.093
to keep some money in your
pocket before you moved.

01:22:50.535 --> 01:22:52.034
- Mom, you want some gum?

01:22:52.135 --> 01:22:53.564
- I'm okay, sweetie.

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:55.279
Why don't you go inside?

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:57.769
See what you want.
We'll be right in.

01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:00.198
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:00.307 --> 01:23:01.647
Yep.

01:23:02.309 --> 01:23:03.938
Hope you don't mind.

01:23:04.043 --> 01:23:05.482
- Not at all.

01:23:06.612 --> 01:23:09.851
- Just figured might give
him some responsibility,

01:23:09.947 --> 01:23:14.076
but you know I'll take care
of it when you guys move.

01:23:15.718 --> 01:23:17.957
- It's pretty
thoughtful actually.

01:23:20.554 --> 01:23:23.024
- Cindy, I don't want
you guys to move.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:24.652
Look, I know I...

01:23:25.591 --> 01:23:27.420
I've been absent.

01:23:27.526 --> 01:23:29.925
But I'm here now.

01:23:30.027 --> 01:23:31.667
I feel like

01:23:31.762 --> 01:23:34.231
I'm just gettin' to know him.

01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:36.199
Like I can hear him, you know,

01:23:36.297 --> 01:23:38.066
for the first time.

01:23:39.099 --> 01:23:41.368
- What's he saying?

01:23:41.467 --> 01:23:43.867
- He's saying he needs his dad.

01:23:45.904 --> 01:23:47.003
He's saying who's
gonna help me shave

01:23:47.104 --> 01:23:49.374
this thing I have
growing on my lip?

01:23:49.473 --> 01:23:51.242
You?

01:23:51.341 --> 01:23:54.100
- I guess I thought
I would, yeah.

01:23:55.711 --> 01:23:57.470
- Cindy, I need him.

01:23:59.046 --> 01:23:59.986
I do.

01:24:07.752 --> 01:24:09.752
- I decided not to go.

01:24:12.055 --> 01:24:13.255
- Really?

01:24:13.922 --> 01:24:15.092
- Yeah.

01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:17.529
I can't do that to him.

01:24:18.826 --> 01:24:21.225
And I can't do that to you.

01:24:23.262 --> 01:24:25.831
- Thank you.

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:30.669
- Plus there's like sharks
and earthquakes in San Diego.

01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:33.931
Fuck that.

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:36.536
Let's go eat.
- Yeah.

01:24:39.139 --> 01:24:39.969
I'm buyin'.

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:40.943
- All right. Oh.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.840
- Yeah.

01:24:41.941 --> 01:24:42.611
- Okay.

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:43.438
- Hope they take quarters.

01:24:51.748 --> 01:24:53.647
- What are you thinking?

01:24:56.184 --> 01:24:57.724
- Nothin'.

01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:03.950
- You sometimes get
this very far away look.

01:25:05.123 --> 01:25:06.893
Where do you go?

01:25:12.528 --> 01:25:14.767
- This might sound
a little funny.

01:25:18.265 --> 01:25:19.834
- Tell me.

01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:25.030
- When I was born I
had a twin sister,

01:25:25.136 --> 01:25:26.376
her name was Jennifer,

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:29.669
but she died after six hours
'cause she had a bad heart.

01:25:31.107 --> 01:25:32.737
- Wow, I'm sorry.

01:25:33.842 --> 01:25:35.982
- I keep a journal for her.

01:25:36.977 --> 01:25:39.277
- Yeah?

01:25:39.379 --> 01:25:41.278
- Well, we were suppose to
spend our whole lives together.

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:44.989
I think we still do, but I'm
the only one that's still here.

01:25:47.218 --> 01:25:50.857
I don't write anything
down I just talk to her.

01:25:52.221 --> 01:25:53.981
She doesn't talk back.

01:25:54.956 --> 01:25:57.765
It's not something
I do everyday.

01:25:57.858 --> 01:26:00.627
- It's kind of like praying.

01:26:00.727 --> 01:26:03.826
- Yeah, except I don't
ask her for anything.

01:26:03.929 --> 01:26:06.159
- And do you think
that she hears you?

01:26:07.297 --> 01:26:08.997
- Yeah.

01:26:11.835 --> 01:26:16.463
It sounds really crazy when I
say it out loud, doesn't it?

01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:18.839
You know Elvis had a
stillborn twin too.

01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:22.048
So, in a way I'm
kinda like Elvis.

01:26:22.842 --> 01:26:25.111
- You've never told anyone this?

01:26:25.209 --> 01:26:28.078
- Except for the other
managers at the bank, no.

01:26:30.112 --> 01:26:31.082
Jen!

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.450
You know that bolt
of lightning you said

01:26:32.548 --> 01:26:33.607
you could strike somebody with,

01:26:33.715 --> 01:26:35.025
now's a good time.

01:26:35.116 --> 01:26:36.675
- No, you said that she
couldn't talk back to you.

01:26:36.784 --> 01:26:38.454
- Well, I just didn't want
you to think I was crazy.

01:26:38.552 --> 01:26:40.721
- It's too late for that.

01:27:28.919 --> 01:27:30.178
Dear Jen,

01:27:30.286 --> 01:27:31.956
I can't help but think
that you had a hand

01:27:32.054 --> 01:27:35.063
in bringing this new
family into my life.

01:27:39.192 --> 01:27:42.831
- You know, you could
help me out with this.

01:27:42.928 --> 01:27:45.827
- Yeah, I'm not sure I'm
ready for that responsibility.

01:27:49.432 --> 01:27:50.631
No offense Jen,

01:27:50.733 --> 01:27:53.062
but I've always hated
coming out here.

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:54.837
It just didn't seem fair
that most of my family

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.405
was gone so soon.

01:27:56.503 --> 01:27:59.942
But that's the whole point
of a graveyard I guess.

01:28:00.039 --> 01:28:03.008
To make you appreciate
being on this side of life.

01:28:05.776 --> 01:28:07.106
I don't know that
I'll be able to keep

01:28:07.211 --> 01:28:09.810
a very extensive journal
for you this year, Jen.

01:28:09.913 --> 01:28:12.652
I sort of owe it to Vera
and Adam, and everyone else,

01:28:12.748 --> 01:28:14.747
to be there for them.

01:28:14.849 --> 01:28:16.818
They have to be the ones
that I share my thoughts

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:18.357
and dreams with.

01:28:18.451 --> 01:28:19.680
- Oh, there you are.

01:28:19.785 --> 01:28:22.525
- C'mon Dad, you're
gonna miss it.

01:28:22.621 --> 01:28:24.350
- I'll be right there, buddy.

01:28:28.325 --> 01:28:29.864
- You okay?

01:28:29.959 --> 01:28:31.858
They say what you're
doing on New Year's Eve

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.029
is what you'll be doing
all of the next year.

01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:37.230
