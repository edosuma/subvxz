WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:09.310
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.380
AND NOW ONE FOR
MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.748
WHAT FORMER U.S.
SENATOR SPONSORED

00:14.782 --> 00:17.751
THE LANDMARK CONSUMER CREDIT
PROTECTION ACT OF 1996?

00:17.785 --> 00:20.254
WAS IT RUSSELL BURKE OF OHIO?

00:20.288 --> 00:23.491
IT WAS. CORRECT FOR $10.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.460
NOW, RYDER, WHAT
MIDWESTERN CONGRESSMAN

00:26.494 --> 00:28.162
DEFIED THE ODDS BY BEING
ELECTED TO THE...

00:28.196 --> 00:30.030
YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.233
UH, RUSSELL BURKE OF OHIO.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.102
BEFORE I EVEN FINISHED
THE QUESTION.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.470
A GOLDEN BOY.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.473
YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST THREE
HOURS I'VE EVER SPENT WITH MY DAD,

00:39.507 --> 00:42.143
EXCEPT FOR THE TIME HE HAD
THAT HEAD INJURY WHILE SKIING.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.578
BUT THEN HE REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.215
I HAVE TO SAY, THIS TRIP
HE HAS BEEN SUPERSWEET.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.317
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS UP WITH HIM?

00:49.350 --> 00:51.285
WHY DOES ANYTHING HAVE
TO BE UP WITH HIM?

00:51.319 --> 00:53.287
WHY CAN'T A GUY JUST COME
AND ENJOY HIS DAUGHTER

00:53.321 --> 00:56.023
AND HIS GRANDKIDS WITHOUT
HAVING AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.059
I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST GETTING THIS VERY
KIND OF COLD, ITCHY FEELING ABOUT HIM.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.628
OKAY, IF THAT'S ANOTHER
ONE OF YOUR HINTS

01:00.661 --> 01:03.731
ABOUT ME GIVING YOU
HEALTH BENEFITS, NO.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.600
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M GONNA TELL HIM TO
FORGET ABOUT THE HOTEL AND STAY HERE.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.670
WAIT A MINUTE, BACK UP. THREE HOURS
WITHOUT AN EXPLOSION BETWEEN YOU TWO

01:09.703 --> 01:11.305
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN HE
CAN STAY HERE ALL WEEK LONG?

01:11.339 --> 01:13.674
I'M BARELY GONNA BE HERE. I
MEAN I'VE GOT COUNCIL HEARINGS

01:13.707 --> 01:15.176
EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK
ON THAT RAILYARD THING.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.311
HOW NICE, YOU GET TO BE
DOWNTOWN AT FANCY HEARINGS

01:17.345 --> 01:18.679
AND I'M STUCK HERE AT THE
HOUSE SENATOR-SITTING.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.415
OH, COME ON, JOE. LET HIM STAY.

01:21.449 --> 01:25.319
YOU'RE REALLY SO CUTE THE WAY YOU ACT
AS IF I ACTUALLY HAVE A SAY IN THIS.

01:25.353 --> 01:29.590
NO MORE WINE FOR ME. BIG
DRIVE TO THE HOTEL.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.525
ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE TO
TAKE THE LONG WAY AROUND

01:31.559 --> 01:33.794
TO AVOID THE SOBRIETY
CHECKPOINTS.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.597
DADDY, ABOUT THAT, I WAS
THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU COULD...

01:36.630 --> 01:38.466
WHY I'D BE DELIGHTED
TO STAY HERE.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.269
OH, BEFORE I EVEN
FINISH THE QUESTION.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.471
WELL, I'M A GOLDEN BOY.

01:43.504 --> 01:47.107
CAR'S OUTSIDE. TWO LOUIS
VUITTON BAGS IN THE TRUNK.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.543
I'LL TELL THE BELLMAN.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.339
OH, SHE'S, UM...

02:18.372 --> 02:20.774
SHE'S FINE.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.577
YOU MIGHT THINK TWICE IF "60
MINUTES" ASKS YOU FOR AN INTERVIEW.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.348
LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.716
I GOT THREE POEMS PUBLISHED.

02:28.749 --> 02:32.119
HOW'D YOU GET THREE POEMS
ON THAT ITTY-BITTY PHONE?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.721
IT'S THE SCHOOL LITERARY BLOG.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.889
AND I'M THE ONLY PERSON
WHO GOT THAT MANY IN.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.726
WOW, THAT'S GREAT. LET ME SEE.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.694
"DEAD LEAVES, DEAD HEART,"

02:40.728 --> 02:44.198
"WAITING FOR THE END,"
"BLOOD IS THE NEW BLACK."

02:44.232 --> 02:48.602
WOW, I'M SO PROUD AND
POSSIBLY WORRIED.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.304
I LIKE TO WORK DARK.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.873
YES YOU DO. NICE GOING, HONEY.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.277
BACK IN MY DAY THIS WAS
CALLED A MOM PROBLEM.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.646
- ( phone rings )
- OH, THAT'S ME.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.350
SO GLAD YOU CALLED.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.917
YEAH, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

03:03.951 --> 03:07.388
WOW, LOOK AT THE TIME. HEY,
I'LL SEE YOU ALL LATER ON.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.722
WHERE YOU HEADED, RUSSELL?

03:08.756 --> 03:12.326
OUT AND ABOUT, JOSEPH.
OUT AND ABOUT.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.462
HEY, WHEN MY FATHER IS IN
TOWN WITHOUT MY MOTHER

03:14.495 --> 03:16.364
IT'S NEVER A GOOD IDEA
TO ASK WHERE HE'S GOING.

03:16.397 --> 03:20.501
- GOT IT. BE ALWAYS
BE FAMILY FRIENDLY.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.370
WHAT PART OF "I GOT
IT" WAS NOT CLEAR?

03:22.403 --> 03:24.872
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT HE
HAS A TENDENCY... JOE?

03:24.905 --> 03:26.640
IT'S OKAY, KEEP TALKING.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.746
THIS IS LIKE A HUGE TURNING
POINT IN YOUR LIFE.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.883
NO IT'S NOT. IT'S JUST A TEXT.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.751
NO NO, IT'S A HUGE TEXT.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.220
I'M GONNA TAKE A PICTURE
OF YOU READING IT.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.356
AUNT MEL WILL UNDERSTAND
HOW BIG THIS IS.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.325
THIS IS ENORMOUS. THIS IS EPIC.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.394
- GO.
- I GOT A TEXT.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.961
( gasps ) SHUT UP!

03:47.995 --> 03:50.331
SO WHAT ARE WE
FREAKING OUT ABOUT?

03:50.364 --> 03:53.901
THERE'S THIS GIRL AT SCHOOL...
JADE GILLIS.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.437
NO, SHE'S NOT JUST THIS GIRL.
SHE'S THE GIRL.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.539
SHE'S POPULAR AMONG THE MASSES.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.841
OH, SO WHY IS SHE TEXTING YOU?

04:00.874 --> 04:03.477
I MEAN, WHY IS SHE TEXTING YOU?

04:03.511 --> 04:06.680
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO BE
A SINGER-SONGWRITER.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.783
YEAH, AND SHE READ MY SISTER
LENNOX'S POEMS ON THE BLOG.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.487
AND NOW SHE WANTS MY SISTER
HER LYRICS.ELP HER WRITE

04:13.521 --> 04:15.389
THIS IS AMAZING.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.625
AND LENNOX IS GONNA SAY YES.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.228
ONLY BECAUSE IT WOULD
AGAINST THE POPULARS.MINATE

04:21.261 --> 04:23.497
OH GOOD, IT'S ABOUT
TIME SOMEONE STOOD UP

04:23.531 --> 04:24.765
FOR THE WELL-LIKED
GLAMOROUS PEOPLE.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.534
YEAH.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.637
QUICK, TEXT HER BACK BEFORE SHE
ASKS SOME OTHER ARTSY FREAK.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.639
OKAY, FINE.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.742
OH MY GOD, JADE GILLIS IS
GONNA COME OVER TO MY HOUSE.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.311
WHAT AM I GONNA WEAR?

04:40.414 --> 04:44.352
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ABLE TO
DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH CITY PROPERTY

04:44.385 --> 04:47.855
WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM
A BUNCH OF SOCCER MOMS.

04:47.888 --> 04:51.492
NO OFFENSE TO ANY OF
YOU FEMALE LADIES.

04:51.525 --> 04:55.262
LOOK, STEPHANIE. I
SEE DEAD PEOPLE.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.898
BUT SERIOUSLY, IF HE'S THE
BEST THEIR SIDE'S GOT,

04:57.931 --> 04:59.500
FRIDAY'S VOTE WON'T
EVEN BE CLOSE.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.969
TOLEDO HAS PLENTY
OF OUTDOOR SPACE.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.772
WHAT WE NEED IS A PARKING LOT,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.907
NOT A LOT OF PARKS.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.710
- DO WE HAVE TO STAY FOR THIS?
- YES, I HAVE TO SHOW RESPECT.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.746
( chuckles ) DOESN'T HIS
CHIN LOOK LIKE A BUTT?

05:14.682 --> 05:16.950
- ( doorbell rings )
- YUP.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.421
- HEY.
- PACKAGE FOR SENATOR BURKE.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.055
YOU MEAN COUNCILWOMAN BURKE?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.758
NO NO, SENATOR RUSSELL BURKE.

05:24.792 --> 05:28.429
SEN... OH, THAT'S
FROM CITY HALL.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.432
- I'LL TAKE THAT TO HIM.
- NO NO NO, HE NEEDS TO SIGN FOR IT HIMSELF.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.402
- IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.
- ABSOLUTELY. OF COURSE IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.637
THAT'S WHY THEY GAVE IT TO
YOU, BECAUSE THEY TRUST YOU.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.006
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WAS JUST TALKING
TO YOUR BOSS YESTERDAY ABOUT YOU.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.909
UM, HELP ME OUT WITH HIS NAME.
IT'S JUST SO HARD TO PRONOUNCE.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.944
COUNCILMAN WALKEN.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.348
WA-WALKEN, YES.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.951
YES, AND THIS IS ABOUT THE...

05:50.984 --> 05:53.587
I'M DRAWING A BLANK HERE. I
HAVEN'T HAD MY COFFEE YET.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.089
- PLANS FOR THE RAILYARD.
- YEAH, SHH. DON'T SAY THAT OUT LOUD.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.427
GET IN HERE. ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.362
I NEVER LEAVE THE DRIVE-THRU WITHOUT
MAKING SURE MY FRIES ARE IN THE BAG FIRST.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.665
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LET'S
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.034
WHAT HAVE WE GOT? OKAY,
"PROPOSED PARKING LOT PLAN."

06:07.067 --> 06:09.537
"TALKING POINTS FOR
SENATOR BURKE."

06:09.570 --> 06:11.839
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SUSPECTING...

06:11.872 --> 06:13.907
UH, EXPECTING. VERY NICE WORK, SON.
THANK YOU.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.477
- SO CAN YOU HAVE HIM SIGN FOR IT NOW?
- ABSOLUTELY, OF COURSE.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.946
HAVE I EVER LET YOU DOWN? HAVE
A VERY NICE DAY. BYE-BYE.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.864
OH, HEY THERE, RUSSELL. OH,
THAT PACKAGE CAME FOR YOU.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.933
INTERESTINGLY IT'S FROM
COUNCILMAN WALKEN.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.170
IS IT? WELL, THANK YOU, JOSEPH.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.674
QUICK QUESTION THERE
FOR YOU, SENATOR.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE
WORKING FOR THE OTHER SIDE?

06:48.576 --> 06:49.910
THE SIDE THAT'S AGAINST
YOUR DAUGHTER?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.045
JOE, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.148
IS THERE ANYMORE OF
THAT SWEET LASAGNA

06:55.182 --> 06:57.785
YOU WHIPPED UP FOR
US LAST NIGHT?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.653
YOU KNOW, SENATOR,
YOUR DAUGHTER THOUGHT

06:59.687 --> 07:02.022
THIS PLEASANT VISIT WAS
JUST A PLEASANT VISIT.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.892
YOU REALLY NEED TO
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.460
YOU KNOW WHAT THE
TRUTH IS, RIGHT?

07:06.494 --> 07:08.929
IT'S THAT LITTLE THING YOU
LIKE TO DANCE AROUND.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.098
Mel: ANYBODY HOME?

07:11.131 --> 07:13.400
- IN HERE.
- NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.402
YOU'RE LIKE A DOG WITH A
BONE, AREN'T YOU, JOE?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.404
- YES I AM.
- HEY, DADDY.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.773
HEY, LITTLE GIRL.
I'VE GOT TO RUN.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.042
- I GOT A RENDEZVOUS AT THE HIATT.
- I DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.845
- MEL, ACTUALLY THIS TIME YOU MIGHT WANT TO...
- YOU HEARD HER, JOE.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.549
RESPECT THE LADY. I'LL SEE
YOU BOTH AT DINNERTIME.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.055
YOU KNOW, I GUESS I JUST HAD TO
GROW UP AND GET OVER MY CRAP

07:35.088 --> 07:37.791
JUST TO SEE HOW
CHARMING MY FATHER IS.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.094
GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOUR DEFINITION OF "IS" IS.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.873
HEY, MEL, I NEED TO TELL YOU WHO YOUR
FATHER IS ACTUALLY MEETING WITH RIGHT NOW.

07:52.906 --> 07:56.744
AS LONG AS IT'S NONE OF MY HIGH
SCHOOL GIRLFRIENDS, I'M OKAY.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.579
NO, HE'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO THE HIATT

07:58.612 --> 08:00.881
TO MEET WITH COUNCILMAN WALKEN.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.716
I THINK THEY'RE IN BED TOGETHER.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.954
OKAY, PLEASE TELL ME THAT
BY "IN BED TOGETHER"

08:06.987 --> 08:10.057
YOU MEAN HE'S ACTUALLY HAVING
SEX WITH COUNCILMAN WALKEN.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.860
AS NICE AS THAT
SOUNDS, NO SUCH LUCK.

08:12.893 --> 08:16.029
OH MY GOD. RUSSELL IS THE EXPERT
WITNESS THEY'RE BRINGING IN.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.831
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A BLUFF.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.100
THIS IS BAD. MY DAD
CAN DO REAL DAMAGE.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.501
WHY? WHO CARES WHAT HE THINKS?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.571
HELLO, IN THIS CITY HE'S BELOVED

08:23.604 --> 08:25.939
AND ADORED. HE'S BEDORED.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.542
I MEAN, WHO COMES PURPOSELY

08:28.576 --> 08:30.177
TO THEIR DAUGHTER'S WORK
TO MAKE HER LOOK BAD?

08:30.210 --> 08:32.179
ARE WE PLAYING THAT GAME AGAIN

08:32.212 --> 08:34.247
WHERE EVERY ANSWER IS
RUSSELL BURKE OF OHIO?

08:37.951 --> 08:41.188
LOOK LOOK, HE'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE GUYS

08:41.221 --> 08:43.156
WHO CAN SEPARATE
FAMILY AND BUSINESS.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.493
HE'S LIKE A MAFIA GUY. HE CAN BITE
THE EAR OFF SOMEONE IN THE AFTERNOON

08:46.526 --> 08:49.930
AND COME HOME AND KISS HIS
CHILDREN WITH THE SAME MOUTH.

08:49.963 --> 08:54.067
OKAY, PUTTING ASIDE FOR A SECOND
HOW ODD YOUR UPBRINGING WAS...

08:54.101 --> 08:56.169
THINGS WERE GOING SO GREAT.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.206
WE WERE CLOSE. WE WERE AFFECTIONATE.
WE WERE BONDING.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.874
I'M GONNA KILL HIM!

09:00.908 --> 09:04.011
YEAH OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? AS
GOOD OF AN IDEA AS THAT MAY BE,

09:04.044 --> 09:05.879
LET'S JUST PUT A PIN
IN THAT FOR A SECOND

09:05.913 --> 09:08.816
AND SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH
SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS MURDERY.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.752
LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO CONFRONT
HIM, YOU HAVE TO DO IT HIS WAY.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.588
- AND IF YOU START RANTING...
- I DO NOT RANT.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.690
YEAH, OKAY.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.592
ALL RIGHT, BUT LET'S
JUST SAY THE WORLD WERE

09:18.626 --> 09:20.628
TO SPIN BACKWARDS AND
YOU DID HAPPEN TO RANT.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.196
HE WOULD DISMISS YOU AS A
HYSTERICAL LITTLE GIRL, OKAY?

09:23.230 --> 09:26.634
LOOK, THIS IS BUSINESS. YOU
NEED TO BE CALM, COLD.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.301
VERY VERY RUSSELL,

09:28.335 --> 09:30.604
IF YOU, YOU KNOW, THINK
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.741
OH, I CAN DO THAT. BUT BACK
TO THE RANTING THING, OKAY?

09:33.774 --> 09:36.143
I DO NOT RANT. I MEAN, SOMETIMES
MAYBE I GET A LITTLE EXCITABLE

09:36.176 --> 09:39.012
AND I MIGHT RATTLE OFF A LIST OF
GRIEVANCES, CONCERNS, OBSERVATIONS

09:39.046 --> 09:41.782
IN A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC MANNER,
BUT THAT IS NOT RANTING.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.617
I MEAN, I DON'T...
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:43.651 --> 09:45.653
I'M GONNA LISTEN TO YOU WHILE
I GO PICK UP THE KIDS.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.757
I DON'T FIND THIS AMUSING.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.040
AND SOME BIGGER TWEAKS.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.352
SURE.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.260
HEY, I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR
HOW UNTALENTED YOUR FRIEND IS.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.065
NO NO, SHE'S JUST REALLY, UM...

11:38.098 --> 11:40.768
POPULAR?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.235
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
HERE, LENNOX, HUH?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.137
WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
REWRITE ALL OF HER SONGS

11:44.171 --> 11:46.173
AND SHE'S GONNA ALLOW
YOU TO GET HER SOME TEA

11:46.206 --> 11:48.408
AND MAYBE EVEN INVITE YOU
TO ONE OF HER PARTIES?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.377
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.279
OKAY YEAH, IT'S PRETTY
MUCH JUST LIKE THAT.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.982
HEY, I'VE ONLY BEEN AT
THIS SCHOOL A FEW MONTHS.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.185
- I'M TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS.
- Jade: MAKE SURE IT'S HERBAL!

12:00.220 --> 12:02.122
I'M SORRY, DID YOU SAY FRIEND

12:02.155 --> 12:04.491
OR TEA BITCH?

12:08.762 --> 12:11.932
( car approaches )

12:11.965 --> 12:14.367
( car door shuts )

12:15.502 --> 12:18.138
HEY, PUMPKIN. YOU'RE UP LATE.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.308
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO DO A LOT
OF EXTRA WORK WHEN THE OTHER SIDE

12:21.341 --> 12:25.112
IS BRINGING IN THE HOTSHOT RINGER
SENATOR WHO IS STAYING AT MY HOUSE

12:25.145 --> 12:28.248
AND STANDING IN MY KITCHEN AS WE SPEAK.
NEED I GO ON?

12:28.281 --> 12:31.051
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND, DARLING?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.419
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.088
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA RUN
UPSTAIRS NOW, SLAM THE DOOR

12:35.122 --> 12:36.924
AND THROW YOURSELF
ON YOUR CANOPY BED?

12:36.957 --> 12:39.960
NO NO NO, MY SISTER WAS THE ONE
WITH THE CANOPY BED, NOT ME.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.494
BUT THAT IS ANCIENT HISTORY

12:41.528 --> 12:44.197
BECAUSE I AM CALM,
COLD AND STEELY.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.200
AND SIMPLY CURIOUS

12:47.234 --> 12:50.437
WHY YOU WOULD DELIBERATELY
WORK AGAINST ME.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.306
IT'S JUST POLITICS. IT'S MY JOB.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.343
BUT... OKAY.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.211
OH, COME ON. JUST
LET IT OUT, HONEY.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.447
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
BETTER AFTER A GOOD CRY

13:00.480 --> 13:04.051
- AND A LITTLE ICE CREAM.
- OKAY, I'M NOT DOING THAT.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.987
OH, HEY.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.022
I WAS JUST, UM...

13:09.056 --> 13:11.058
REALIZING THAT I SHOULD
HAVE GONE TO BED THIRSTY.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.926
OKAY, NO NO NO, JOE.
JOE, COME IN HERE.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.527
- NO NO. I JUST WANT TO...
- YEAH, NO NO NO.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.763
LISTEN, MY FATHER WAS JUST
ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING

13:16.796 --> 13:19.199
ABOUT HIS FAILURE TO DISCLOSE
WHY HE'S REALLY HERE IN TOWN.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.434
YES I WAS.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.304
MEL DEAR,

13:24.337 --> 13:28.408
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT
I AM SO SO VERY SORRY

13:28.441 --> 13:32.212
THAT YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT
SOMETHING I MIGHT HAVE SAID

13:32.245 --> 13:35.148
OR DIDN'T SAY.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.151
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.355
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- IT WAS AN APOLOGY.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.358
- NO IT WASN'T.
- IT'S THE BEST YOU'RE GONNA GET FROM THAT GUY.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.127
LOOK, YOU STOOD UP
TO YOUR OLD MAN.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.196
YOU HELD YOUR GROUND.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.264
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT WAS TERRIBLE.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.433
- AND WHERE WERE YOU THIS WHOLE TIME?
- SUPPORTING YOU...

13:53.466 --> 13:56.069
FROM DOWNSTAIRS
WHERE IT WAS SAFE.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.072
WELL, THIS WAS YOUR IDEA, ME
BEING CALM, COOL AND STEELY.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.474
- YOU TOLD ME YOU COULD DO IT.
- WHY DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.410
I MEAN, I CAN'T DO
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.513
I HAVE MY OWN METHODS.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.882
ICE CREAM? REALLY?

14:08.916 --> 14:12.419
LEAVE ME ALONE. IT'S A
CLICHE BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.366
OF COURSE WE NEED SPORTS
FIELDS FOR CHILDREN.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.436
EVERYBODY WANTS THAT.
I WANT THAT.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.571
LOOK AT THAT. HE'S SUCKING US IN

14:31.604 --> 14:33.840
BY APPEARING TO AGREE WITH US.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.342
HE'S HYPNOTIC.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.079
YOU WILL AWAKEN NOW.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.982
BUT THE PEOPLE ON THIS COUNCIL
HAVE TO BE THE GROWNUPS

14:42.015 --> 14:43.984
AND MAKE THE GROWNUP DECISIONS.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.619
NOW PARKING LOTS
MAY NOT BE SEXY,

14:46.653 --> 14:49.356
BUT THEY PAY FOR THE
SCHOOLS AND THE LIBRARIES

14:49.389 --> 14:51.591
AND YES, EVEN THE SOCCER FIELDS.

14:51.624 --> 14:55.495
AND WE WILL HAVE THOSE
IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.597
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.167
( applause )

15:02.970 --> 15:04.938
AND NOW,

15:04.972 --> 15:07.574
SPEAKING FOR THE OTHER
SIDE, THE DAUGHTER.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.443
YOU KNOW COUNCILWOMAN BURKE.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.112
AHEM.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.214
ISN'T IT NICE TO HEAR
FROM SENATOR BURKE AGAIN?

15:14.247 --> 15:17.450
TAKES US ALL BACK, WAY BACK.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.886
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE

15:19.919 --> 15:21.955
WHICH HINGES ON JOBS,

15:21.989 --> 15:24.157
JOBS FILLED BY PEOPLE
WITH FAMILIES.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.126
AND WHY WILL THESE
PEOPLE CHOOSE TOLEDO?

15:26.159 --> 15:28.461
BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD
PLACE TO LIVE.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.064
NOT BECAUSE IT'S A
GOOD PLACE TO PARK.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.066
( mouths )

15:33.100 --> 15:35.935
WELL, I'VE READ ALL
YOUR NEW SONGS.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.038
THANKS. I TRIED WRITING
ABOUT MY PAIN.

15:38.071 --> 15:41.108
YEAH, I SAW THE ONE ABOUT
GETTING YOUR EARS PIERCED.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.376
LISTEN, JADE,

15:43.410 --> 15:45.278
IT'S BEEN GREAT
SITTING AT YOUR TABLE

15:45.312 --> 15:48.048
WITH YOU AND ALEXA AND MADISON

15:48.081 --> 15:50.350
AND ALL THE ASHLEYS

15:50.383 --> 15:52.452
AND GOING TO YOUR PARTIES.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.487
AND I KNOW BEING AS
POPULAR AS YOU ARE

15:54.521 --> 15:57.090
PEOPLE MAY NOT ALWAYS
TELL YOU THINGS LIKE,

15:57.124 --> 15:59.426
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH BECAUSE
THEY LIKE WHERE THEY SIT.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.929
BUT, JADE, YOUR SONGS ARE...

16:02.962 --> 16:04.331
PROMISING? MOVING?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.366
GOD-AWFUL.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.668
I'M SORRY, BUT THEY ARE.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.370
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.174
WOW, LENNOX.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.276
THAT TOOK A LOT OF GUTS.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.579
I THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
THAT'S EVER BEEN HONEST WITH ME.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.349
I'M NOT COMING TO YOUR
PARTIES ANYMORE, AM I?

16:22.382 --> 16:24.551
OH NO.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.054
AND THE LUNCH TABLE?
FORGET ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

16:27.087 --> 16:30.223
UNTIL THE DAY I
STOP WEARING SHOES.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.327
IT'S A SHAME 'CAUSE YOU'RE A
REALLY GOOD SONG TWEAKER.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.263
YEAH, I ACTUALLY ENJOYED IT.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.365
MAYBE WE CAN WORK OUT
ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.033
LIKE WHAT?

16:40.067 --> 16:43.236
I COULD PAY YOU. MY
FAMILY'S LOADED.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.009
NO NO NO, I COULDN'T
TAKE YOUR MONEY.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.611
WHOA WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.114
LET'S... LET'S... LET'S
HEAR THE WOMAN OUT.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.349
HI, JOE LONGO. WE DIDN'T GET A
CHANCE TO MEET THE OTHER DAY.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.984
I ACTUALLY REPRESENT LENNOX.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.087
SO WITH THE INITIAL PAYMENT,
THAT'S VERY EASY TO HAMMER OUT.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.521
WHAT WE WANT IS A
VERY LARGE PIECE

17:01.554 --> 17:04.291
OF THE INTERNATIONAL
RIGHTS AND THE ROYALTIES.

17:04.324 --> 17:08.428
OKAY, BUT I GET TO WEAR A PINK
DRESS ON THE ALBUM COVER.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.598
HMM. I'M GONNA HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.704
WE ARE GOING TO OWN HER.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.175
- COUNCILMAN SANCHEZ?
- AYE.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.177
- COUNCILMAN WALKEN?
- NAY.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.080
THE MEASURE APPROVING THE
TOLEDO RAILYARD SOCCER FIELDS

17:27.114 --> 17:28.748
PASSES BY A VOTE OF FIVE TO TWO.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.784
- ( applause )
- I DID IT! I DID IT!

17:31.818 --> 17:34.321
I MEAN, FOR THE
CHILDREN OF TOLEDO.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.357
WOW!

17:37.390 --> 17:39.025
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING DOWN,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.228
LIKE TOTAL TITANIC.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.363
WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD
GO TALK TO MY DAD.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.797
YOU KNOW, BE A GOOD SPORT.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.412
DADDY. IF I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU BETTER,

17:59.446 --> 18:01.748
I'D THINK YOU DUCKED OUT
AFTER THE VOTE TO AVOID ME.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.616
NO NO, IT'S JUST THAT THIS HERE

18:03.650 --> 18:05.585
IS THE ONLY FOUR
SQUARE FEET IN OHIO

18:05.618 --> 18:07.620
WHERE A MAN CAN STILL
SMOKE A CIGAR.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.756
IT PUTS HAIR IN THE LUNGS.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.091
NOT TONIGHT, HONEY.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.361
- SO YOU'RE OKAY?
- SURE.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.762
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.131
ALL RIGHT THEN.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.699
DINNER'S IN AN HOUR.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.771
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

18:24.804 --> 18:27.574
I WAS ONLY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
DAMN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.276
I SURE AS HELL HAD
SOMETHING TO OFFER

18:29.309 --> 18:32.212
ABOUT A LITTLE SOCCER FIELD
IN MY OWN HOME TOWN.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.814
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK
YOUR FATHER FOR HELP?

18:36.616 --> 18:39.252
I GUESS I WAS AFRAID
YOU WOULD TAKE OVER.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.422
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
BE COUNCILWOMAN BURKE.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.625
I'D JUST BE SENATOR BURKE'S DAUGHTER WHO HAS
TO CALL HER DADDY WHEN SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.761
ALL I'M SAYING IS I
COULD HAVE HELPED YOU.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.631
DADDY, I WON.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.433
FIVE TO TWO.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.102
WITH ME ON YOUR SIDE IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN SEVEN TO NOTHING.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.805
- WHAT ABOUT WALKEN?
- THE MAN'S PUTTY.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.807
A NIGHT ON THE TOWN WITH ME,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.676
I COULD HAVE HIM VOTING FOR THE
COMMUNIST PARTY IF I WANTED.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.180
YOU KNOW, DAD, YOU DID HELP ME.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.381
DID I?

19:08.415 --> 19:10.750
YEAH, YOU THINK MY CLOSING
SPEECH CAME OUT OF THIN AIR?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.852
THAT WAS YEARS OF LISTENING
TO RUSSELL BURKE.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.289
I RIP YOU OFF ALL THE TIME.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.692
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.763
YOU GOT MY SILVER TONGUE AND
YOUR MOTHER'S GOOD LOOKS.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.899
AND MY GOOD LOOKS.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.569
THAT'S A DEADLY COMBINATION.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.839
YOU WORRIED I MAY
OUTSHINE YOU SOMEDAY?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.641
CONSTANTLY.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.476
AH...

19:36.509 --> 19:38.478
CONGRATULATIONS ON
YOUR WIN, PUMPKIN.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.382
LIKE FATHER LIKE DAUGHTER.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.285
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.354
I DIDN'T REALIZE I
WAS HURTING YOU.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.257
OH PSHAW. I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.891
I DON'T GET MY FEELINGS HURT.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.694
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.796
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE?

19:56.829 --> 19:59.899
ICE CREAM FOR OLD DUDES.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.601
( laughs )

20:11.478 --> 20:13.179
HEY, DO THESE THINGS KEEP?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.181
CAN I LEAVE THIS IN THE
FREEZER TILL LATER?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.883
- IS THAT A CUBAN?
- YEAH.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.385
YOU WANT IT? IT'S ALL YOURS,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.254
IF YOU AGREE YOU WERE WRONG.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.823
OKAY, I WAS WRONG.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.892
( sniffs ) ABOUT WHAT?

20:25.925 --> 20:29.228
YOU SAID THAT RUSSELL
WAS COLD AND RATIONAL

20:29.262 --> 20:31.664
AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO DEAL WITH
HIM WAS TO LEAVE EMOTIONS OUT OF IT.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.666
- YEAH?
- WELL, IT TURNS OUT

20:33.700 --> 20:36.536
THAT UNDERNEATH THAT HARD
SHELL OF MACHO DENIAL

20:36.569 --> 20:38.605
THERE'S A BIG GOOEY
EMOTIONAL CENTER.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.374
HE WAS HURT THAT I DIDN'T ASK
FOR HIS HELP... GENUINELY HURT.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.777
( chuckles ) WOW, HE'S GOOD.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.446
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.281
HE WON YOU BACK USING
THE EMOTIONAL CARD.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.283
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY IT, BUT IF YOU
HAVE TO THEN YOU'VE GOT TO THROW IT.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.484
IT'S LIKE A THIRD-DEGREE
BLACK BELT MOVE.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.786
VERY FEW GUYS CAN
EVEN PULL IT OFF.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.555
YOU ARE SO COMPLETELY
FULL OF IT.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.391
I MEAN, MEN HAVE EMOTIONS
AND SENSITIVITIES.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.560
MOST MEN. I MEAN,
CLEARLY NOT YOU.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.929
YOU'RE REALLY KIND
OF SAD, JOE LONGO.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.567
THAT'S KIND OF HARSH, BURKE.
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE

21:07.600 --> 21:09.702
THAT ACTUALLY WANTED YOU TO RECONNECT
WITH YOUR FATHER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.739
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SEEING YOU
GO THROUGH ALL THIS WITH YOUR DAD

21:12.772 --> 21:16.776
SORT OF REMINDS ME OF STUFF
THAT I WENT THROUGH WITH MINE.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.946
I'M REALLY, UH...

21:22.849 --> 21:24.351
IT'S JUST TOO PAINFUL.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.855
JOE, LOOK, I TAKE IT BACK.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.657
I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU
WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.792
THIRD-DEGREE BLACK BELT.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.699
( theme music playing )
