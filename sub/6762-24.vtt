02:05.375 --> 02:08.741
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen,
the world table-cup playoffs.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.747
lt's all right. The action is fast,
he's moving, he's grooving.

02:11.921 --> 02:13.628
- Flag on that play.
- Thank you very much.

02:13.798 --> 02:14.828
Come on, come on.

02:15.049 --> 02:17.918
Ladies and gentlemen,
is this world-class action or what?

02:18.092 --> 02:21.257
- Shut up, rabbit, shut up.
- One of our contestants is nervous.

02:21.428 --> 02:23.254
lt's young Sanders
from Beverly Hills,

02:23.429 --> 02:25.337
obviously outclassed
by the world champion.

02:25.514 --> 02:30.138
- Hey, hey, hey. Yes, yes!
- Ladies and gentlemen:

02:30.309 --> 02:32.881
- The cup!
- The cup!

02:36.980 --> 02:40.394
Why don't you and your fans
stomp on my dishes next time?

02:40.607 --> 02:42.397
That way they'll be sure
to get broken.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.516
Sorry, Nat. The action just got
a little fast and furious, that's all.

02:46.736 --> 02:48.811
l'm glad someone's
keeping busy around here.

02:48.987 --> 02:52.769
Can we start cleaning up this place,
or do l have to do everything myself?

02:54.783 --> 02:58.649
The Peach Pit.
L.A.'s newest fun spot.

02:58.869 --> 03:01.868
He's been like this
for the last two weeks.

03:04.081 --> 03:07.662
- Oh, hey, excuse me, Willie.
- Excuse me, bro.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.615
Nat, before l forget,
we're almost out of mustard.

03:10.793 --> 03:12.998
What happened to that last shipment
that was delivered?

03:13.170 --> 03:14.332
Came in about two months ago.

03:14.504 --> 03:16.542
You know how many jars
we go through a week.

03:16.714 --> 03:18.955
No, Brandon, l haven't a clue
how to run this place.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.170
l've just been doing it
for the last 20 years.

03:21.342 --> 03:23.713
Look, Nat, if you want to fire me,
go ahead, okay?

03:23.885 --> 03:27.252
Just stop biting my head off
every time l open my mouth.

03:27.429 --> 03:29.586
Hey, come on back.

03:30.181 --> 03:31.639
Come on.

03:32.308 --> 03:34.714
lt's not you, believe me.

03:35.101 --> 03:37.057
l'm just going through
a little rough patch.

03:37.269 --> 03:38.513
Really? l hadn't noticed.

03:39.896 --> 03:43.098
lt's what l get for remodelling this place
just in time for the recession.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.349
Nat, should l start looking
for another job?

03:46.525 --> 03:49.524
Nah, you're okay. You're part time.

03:49.694 --> 03:52.646
l can be flexible with your hours.

03:54.739 --> 03:57.026
lt's Willie l'm worried about.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.897
- Why, what's wrong with Willie?
- He wants a raise.

04:01.077 --> 04:03.697
l can't blame him.
He's worked here for five years.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.611
He's got a family to support,
another on the way,

04:06.789 --> 04:09.741
but l'm practically carrying
the guys in the kitchen as it is now.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.579
- You're not gonna fire him, are you?
- l don't want to.

04:14.919 --> 04:16.293
But l'm not made of money.

04:18.588 --> 04:20.745
Something's gotta give.

04:25.468 --> 04:28.670
- Hi, Mom.
- Well, hello there.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.007
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Like what?

04:32.180 --> 04:36.010
Like the preliminary meeting
of the Teen Advisory Board.

04:39.852 --> 04:41.511
First part is sort of like
a demographic.

04:41.687 --> 04:45.765
You're gonna need to ask people,
their age, their sex, their interests.

04:45.939 --> 04:48.773
You think Dad would mind
if l let this become Brenda's thing?

04:48.941 --> 04:49.971
Nice try.

04:50.150 --> 04:51.477
Mom, l just can't get psyched

04:51.651 --> 04:54.223
about being a teen consultant
for a shopping mall.

04:54.403 --> 04:56.774
Brandon, you promised your father
you'd help.

04:56.947 --> 05:00.943
Now, this is a very important client.
He's counting on you.

05:01.116 --> 05:03.784
Let me get the questionnaires,
you'll see what l'm talking about.

05:03.951 --> 05:05.113
Excuse me.

05:09.413 --> 05:11.451
Hello, who's that?

05:11.623 --> 05:14.492
Well, why don't you go in
and find out?

05:14.667 --> 05:16.409
Besides, your father just saw you.

05:17.043 --> 05:18.916
Brandon, why don't you join us?

05:22.005 --> 05:25.503
- So this is the prodigal son.
- Yeah, about 45 minutes later.

05:25.674 --> 05:28.246
- Hey, l got held up at work, okay?
- Oh, that's a likely story.

05:28.884 --> 05:31.718
You'd better be nice to me
or you're gonna lose your token male.

05:31.928 --> 05:34.465
Does that mean you're gonna help
pass out questionnaires?

05:34.638 --> 05:35.668
Do l have a choice?

05:35.847 --> 05:37.257
- No.
- Yes.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.922
Well, l'm glad that's cleared up.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.054
- Sandwich?
- No, thanks.

05:44.228 --> 05:45.425
No, thank you.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.802
Well, l must say,
this is no ordinary shopping mall.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.853
Well, nothing my father does
is ordinary.

05:50.565 --> 05:53.767
- Your father is Dickson St. Claire?
- Yeah.

05:53.984 --> 05:58.110
- Well, l guess it isn't what you know.
- And don't you ever forget it.

05:59.488 --> 06:01.563
lf those two ever get together,
we could retire.

06:01.739 --> 06:03.695
Oh, Jim.

06:04.783 --> 06:07.782
Dad, are they actually gonna put
a real lake in the middle of this thing?

06:07.952 --> 06:08.982
What the plans call for.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.034
lf we get a variance
from the zoning board.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.781
Well, that's what we're here for.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.787
You got yourself
a heavyweight client, Dad.

06:14.956 --> 06:15.986
Very impressive.

06:16.791 --> 06:18.533
Glad you approve.

06:20.793 --> 06:23.911
Your father's really a great guy,
but l guess you already know that.

06:24.087 --> 06:26.577
He's okay, for a dad.

06:26.756 --> 06:27.953
l just wanna know one thing.

06:28.132 --> 06:30.088
How come your dad cares
what teenagers think

06:30.258 --> 06:31.455
he should put in his mall?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.835
Because l asked him to.

06:36.345 --> 06:40.507
- l like Marcie, she's very dynamic.
- Yes, and she's hitting on my brother.

06:40.681 --> 06:42.055
Oh, Brenda, forget it.

06:42.224 --> 06:44.215
Marcie St. Claire
goes to college for God's sakes.

06:44.392 --> 06:46.218
She is the president of her sorority.

06:46.394 --> 06:49.062
Kelly, all sorts of girls have been
throwing themselves at Brandon

06:49.229 --> 06:50.603
ever since we turned 1 2 years old.

06:50.771 --> 06:53.308
You begin to be able to recognise
the signs after a while.

06:54.441 --> 06:55.899
- l don't know exactly--
- Yeah.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.189
No, but this is...

06:58.360 --> 07:00.684
Just two minutes. You have to
fill out this questionnaire.

07:00.861 --> 07:02.603
- Okay.
- St. Claire Development Company

07:02.779 --> 07:04.936
is conducting a survey
on the west side to determine--

07:05.114 --> 07:06.691
Brandon,
why do we need another mall?

07:06.865 --> 07:09.022
- lt's not just another mall.
- Oh, l can see that.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.034
lt's a ''total environmental experience.''
Who put you up to this?

07:12.202 --> 07:15.036
Donna, this isn't a quiz. l mean
there are no right or wrong answers.

07:15.204 --> 07:16.484
Yeah, it's not that hard.

07:16.663 --> 07:18.987
Yeah, they just wanna know
what your favourite stores are.

07:19.165 --> 07:22.532
Well, l like the ones
that take credit cards.

07:23.585 --> 07:26.122
l suppose l shouldn't even ask you
to fill out one of these?

07:26.295 --> 07:27.457
No.

07:27.671 --> 07:30.421
Andrea, l don't know if they've done
an environmental impact survey.

07:30.589 --> 07:32.166
lf they didn't care about
the community,

07:32.340 --> 07:34.166
they wouldn't bother
with this questionnaire.

07:34.342 --> 07:37.010
What about noise abatement?
Traffic control?

07:37.177 --> 07:38.836
Are you gonna fill it out or what?

07:39.053 --> 07:41.756
Okay, let me see, David wants
a music store and a coffee house.

07:41.930 --> 07:44.336
Donna wants high fashion
at discount house prices

07:44.515 --> 07:46.008
and a coffee house.

07:46.183 --> 07:49.182
Okay, Steve wants
a Ferrari dealership, a bowling alley,

07:49.352 --> 07:53.597
a batting cage, an lMAX theatre, and
a virtual reality amusement arcade.

07:53.771 --> 07:54.885
What is that?

07:55.064 --> 07:58.431
l don't know.
But he also wants a coffee bar.

08:00.025 --> 08:03.309
- Well, Bren, you sure called this one.
- What?

08:03.903 --> 08:05.729
l see she works fast.

08:05.904 --> 08:07.942
College girl. Her clock's ticking.

08:08.156 --> 08:09.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.730
- Hi, so you making the rounds?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.824
l've been to Beverly, Crossroads,
Palisades, Santa Monica.

08:14.993 --> 08:16.155
- Big day.
- Yeah.

08:16.328 --> 08:17.987
Well, Brenda and l are done.

08:18.204 --> 08:21.038
Wow, thanks.

08:21.873 --> 08:24.363
So, how about Brandon?
How's he doing?

08:24.583 --> 08:28.531
He's over there with Andrea.
And that could take hours.

08:29.253 --> 08:31.079
Look, Andrea, they're waiting for me.

08:31.254 --> 08:34.917
lf you've got any problem with this,
talk to her. She's in charge.

08:35.131 --> 08:36.590
Maybe l will.

08:36.799 --> 08:37.876
Give me a break, would you?

08:38.049 --> 08:40.255
My father hardly ever asks me
to do anything for him.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.301
Do we have to bring
journalistic ethics

08:42.470 --> 08:44.461
and professional integrity
into everything we do?

08:44.638 --> 08:48.088
l don't know, Brandon.
She looks awfully professional to me.

08:49.099 --> 08:51.304
Look, l don't know if you guys
are interested,

08:51.476 --> 08:53.053
but there's a party at school
next week.

08:53.227 --> 08:55.681
lt's sort of a joint
fraternity/sorority type thing.

08:55.854 --> 08:56.932
Sure, l'll pass.

08:57.146 --> 08:59.387
No, it's not a formal.
lt's a lot of kids hanging out.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.681
- We'd love to come, wouldn't we, Kel?
- Definitely.

09:01.858 --> 09:04.063
- What sorority are you in, anyway?
- Tri Gams.

09:04.651 --> 09:07.319
- Well, the best in the West.
- Yeah, yeah, they're a good group.

09:07.486 --> 09:09.477
Oh, and the theme of the party is
''Am l Blue.''

09:09.654 --> 09:12.144
- So use your imagination.
- Great.

09:12.323 --> 09:15.073
Just promise me you'll introduce me
to the cutest guy there.

09:15.283 --> 09:17.607
- No problem.
- So should l bring Brandon?

09:18.077 --> 09:21.326
No, l'm bringing Brandon.

09:26.791 --> 09:28.581
- How's it going?
- lt's going pretty good.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.327
How's it feel
to be back in high school?

09:30.501 --> 09:33.370
Good. l love the architecture
of Southern California.

09:33.545 --> 09:34.659
All these open plazas.

09:34.838 --> 09:37.410
Back in Minnesota,
all we had was a big brick building.

09:37.631 --> 09:39.753
- And a lot of snow.
- Same here.

09:40.258 --> 09:42.795
- Where'd you go to school?
- Switzerland.

09:44.386 --> 09:46.294
So architecture's your thing, huh?

09:47.179 --> 09:49.716
Yeah, my dream is to design
great buildings

09:49.889 --> 09:51.548
and then build them with my father.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.848
- Going into the family business, then.
- That's the plan.

10:00.771 --> 10:03.770
- Hey, Willie.
- Hey, my number man.

10:03.940 --> 10:07.023
- Here on time for a change.
- Yeah, thanks.

10:08.693 --> 10:12.025
- Don't look at me like that.
- Just couldn't do it, could you?

10:12.196 --> 10:15.065
What can l tell you?
lt's a Peach Pit tradition.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.653
Our motto is,
''Who needs to make a profit?''

10:18.825 --> 10:23.864
- You're a good man, Nat.
- No, you wanna know a good guy?

10:25.454 --> 10:27.196
- See that picture up there?
- Yeah.

10:27.372 --> 10:30.786
That's my dad,
Salvadore Bussichio.

10:31.667 --> 10:36.208
- The one next to Steve McQueen?
- Yup, Sallie fed him.

10:36.378 --> 10:38.619
Carried him for two years.

10:38.796 --> 10:42.874
l was 1 0 years old.
Those were the days.

10:43.049 --> 10:44.756
Who else did you know?

10:46.135 --> 10:47.961
l knew them all.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.795
Nothing lasts forever.

11:00.102 --> 11:02.010
Balanced.

11:02.187 --> 11:04.095
lnnovative.

11:04.605 --> 11:06.146
Dynamic.

11:06.314 --> 11:10.180
High Point Centre
combines commerce and leisure

11:10.359 --> 11:16.110
for an urban community
on the edge of the next millennium.

11:42.588 --> 11:45.291
l can't believe they put my ice rink
in there. That was my idea.

11:45.465 --> 11:48.168
- You and a few other people.
- There's your coffee house, Bren.

11:48.342 --> 11:49.504
Guys, these are fantastic.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.502
- Did you try the spinach souffle?
- Not yet.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.512
Too bad my mom's not here. She's
been craving spinach for a week.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.470
- Her mother's pregnant.
- Really?

11:56.639 --> 11:57.753
Second marriage?

11:57.932 --> 12:00.718
No, not really. See, it's a long story.

12:00.892 --> 12:02.433
lt is the A-list in town.

12:02.601 --> 12:04.758
And the response to the presentation
has been superb.

12:04.936 --> 12:07.177
- You done good, Pops.
- Well, we're getting there.

12:07.355 --> 12:10.888
So, Jim, how does it feel to be on
the ground floor of something so big?

12:11.065 --> 12:13.815
Terrific. Brandon,
l want you to meet Art Peters.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.477
He's project manager for St. Claire.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.807
Hey, how you doing?

12:17.028 --> 12:19.352
- Can l talk to you for a second?
- Can it wait a minute?

12:19.529 --> 12:21.816
- l want Art to meet your mother.
- No, it really can't.

12:21.989 --> 12:23.897
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

12:25.742 --> 12:26.772
What's wrong?

12:26.951 --> 12:30.116
High Point Centre
crosses Olympic to Larrabee.

12:30.286 --> 12:31.696
Yeah.

12:31.912 --> 12:33.619
That's the corner
the Peach Pit is on.

12:35.957 --> 12:37.154
We'll talk about it at home.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.450
They're gonna tear it down,
aren't they?

12:39.667 --> 12:43.579
Brandon, we'll talk about it at home.

12:52.009 --> 12:54.084
You made your point.
lf there's nothing more to say,

12:54.260 --> 12:57.046
- there's nothing more to say.
- Brandon, you're not being fair.

12:57.221 --> 12:58.548
Fair?

12:58.722 --> 13:01.425
You tear down The Peach Pit,
you might as well rip out Nat's heart.

13:01.599 --> 13:03.140
This has got nothing to do with fair.

13:03.308 --> 13:05.015
You're getting
a little carried away here.

13:05.226 --> 13:06.767
How could you not
tell me about this?

13:06.977 --> 13:09.264
l only found out about it
a half hour before you did.

13:09.479 --> 13:12.265
- The address is all over those plans.
- l never put it together.

13:12.439 --> 13:15.107
Brandon, how's Dad supposed to know
the address to the Peach Pit?

13:15.274 --> 13:16.933
Thank you. At least
one of my children

13:17.109 --> 13:18.982
is willing to give me
the benefit of the doubt.

13:19.152 --> 13:20.859
How can l give you
the benefit of the doubt

13:21.028 --> 13:22.225
when you put
a gag order on me?

13:22.404 --> 13:23.945
That's not what l said.

13:24.113 --> 13:25.986
What l said is,
do not discuss this with Nat

13:26.156 --> 13:28.313
until l had a chance to talk
to Art Peters first.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.820
l have to sell Nat out
so you can cover your butt.

13:30.993 --> 13:34.360
Brandon! You apologise
to your father right now.

13:34.537 --> 13:35.734
l'm sorry.

13:35.955 --> 13:39.287
You know, l do have
some influence with these people,

13:39.457 --> 13:42.409
but it's not gonna do any good
if they find out my son

13:42.626 --> 13:44.203
gave confidential information
to someone

13:44.377 --> 13:45.787
they may be in negotiations with.

13:45.961 --> 13:48.711
Dad, you're talking like
l'm some kind of industrial spy.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.548
Brandon, millions of dollars
are riding on this.

13:51.757 --> 13:53.001
Not to mention my reputation.

13:53.174 --> 13:56.376
- But, Dad, we're talking about Nat--
- This is not a request, Brandon.

13:59.512 --> 14:00.970
Fine.

14:02.555 --> 14:03.752
Good night.

14:11.603 --> 14:14.519
Forget it, Bren.
l don't wanna talk about it.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.599
Brandon.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.859
You're asking me to choose
between Nat and Dad.

14:22.026 --> 14:23.768
As far as l'm concerned,
there is no choice.

14:23.944 --> 14:25.354
Yeah, l hear what you're saying.

14:25.529 --> 14:27.485
But let me tell you
what kind of guy Nat is.

14:27.655 --> 14:30.145
The other day he tells me
he can't afford to keep the Pit open

14:30.324 --> 14:31.817
unless he lets Willie the cook go.

14:31.991 --> 14:36.117
Well, l show up the next day,
and Willie is still there.

14:37.286 --> 14:39.776
Look, l'm sure they'll give Nat
a lot of money for the place.

14:39.997 --> 14:43.329
Money's not the issue, Bren.
Nat's family built that place.

14:43.499 --> 14:45.989
lt's his life. Haven't you
heard him talk about the old days?

14:46.167 --> 14:47.364
Brandon, l know.

14:47.543 --> 14:50.792
l like Nat, too. l mean
he even named a milkshake after me.

14:50.962 --> 14:52.621
But we're talking about Dad here.

14:52.838 --> 14:55.921
Yeah, well, l don't want anything to do
with the DSC Development Company

14:56.091 --> 14:58.166
or the Teen Advisory Board,
or any other part of it.

14:58.926 --> 15:01.629
- lncluding Marcie?
- Yeah.

15:01.844 --> 15:04.796
- What about the party Friday night?
- How can l look Marcie in the eye

15:04.971 --> 15:06.797
after l know everything
that's going on?

15:06.973 --> 15:09.759
Brandon, l thought you liked this girl.
And she sure likes you.

15:09.933 --> 15:11.841
l can't do it, Bren.
There's more involved here.

15:12.059 --> 15:15.011
Brandon, come on.
We may wind up going to this school.

15:15.186 --> 15:17.723
l don't know about you, but
l wouldn't mind meeting new people.

15:17.897 --> 15:19.556
Then go.

15:19.731 --> 15:20.893
Fine, l will.

15:21.065 --> 15:23.021
And so will Kelly and Steve,
Donna and Dylan.

15:23.192 --> 15:25.860
And anybody else who's not so
wrapped up in their own principles

15:26.027 --> 15:28.695
that they've forgotten
how to have a good time.

15:29.946 --> 15:32.068
Fine, l'll go.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.691
Brandon, don't do me any favours.

15:34.866 --> 15:37.438
l mean, if you're gonna be a jerk,
stay home.

15:43.372 --> 15:45.198
Hi, guys.

15:49.709 --> 15:52.412
Hello, come on in. l'm Mike.

15:55.796 --> 15:58.286
Are you friends of the bride
or the groom?

15:58.465 --> 15:59.495
Me?

15:59.674 --> 16:01.167
- l'm dying.
- Dylan.

16:01.383 --> 16:03.173
So, where's the keg?

16:03.385 --> 16:06.587
Sorry, but we're still on suspension
for our last blowout.

16:06.762 --> 16:09.216
Why do you think
we're all feeling so blue?

16:10.931 --> 16:12.922
Hey, you guys, don't listen to Mike.
He's a lush.

16:13.099 --> 16:15.933
We have a great coffee bar,
there's cappuccino, there's espresso.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.720
l love what you've done
with the decor.

16:17.894 --> 16:21.178
Yeah, even the painting's blue.
Who did that?

16:21.397 --> 16:24.266
Donna, it's Picasso.
During his blue period.

16:24.482 --> 16:26.355
l guess Donna won't be majoring
in Art History.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.480
- Brandon.
- Hey, baby.

16:31.028 --> 16:33.352
l think you've got the wrong party.

16:33.863 --> 16:37.859
Well, l figured there'd be enough
blue bloods here as it was.

16:38.074 --> 16:41.488
Mooch, no,
this is Brandon Walsh, he's okay.

16:41.702 --> 16:43.279
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

16:43.453 --> 16:46.322
- l should've known you were a rebel.
- Yeah, that's my brother.

16:46.496 --> 16:48.950
Always swimming upstream.
Are we gonna go dance?

16:53.543 --> 16:55.534
So, l guess you're gonna want
to dance, too, huh?

16:56.461 --> 16:57.871
No, let's not and say we did.

16:58.046 --> 17:00.333
l mean, l'm not like
a wallflower or anything,

17:00.506 --> 17:04.288
but some people just weren't meant
to boogie. Know what l mean?

17:06.343 --> 17:08.630
l think l'm in love.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.757
Steve, remember,
l'm not your date tonight.

17:18.934 --> 17:21.056
Shut up and dance.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.893
You know, l can definitely see myself
going out with one of these frat boys.

17:25.063 --> 17:28.347
Really? l could definitely
see myself in this frat.

17:28.523 --> 17:30.646
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.485
l'm exactly the kind of guy
they're looking for.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.272
l guess you do have what it takes.

17:36.446 --> 17:39.979
- All except for one thing.
- What's that?

17:40.157 --> 17:42.030
The grades.

17:45.035 --> 17:48.402
This campus is so beautiful. lt's like
a park, right in the middle of the city.

17:48.579 --> 17:51.863
Yeah, except l wish there were
more trees and less people.

17:52.040 --> 17:55.158
- What, you think they're snobs?
- Not exactly.

17:55.333 --> 17:58.167
There's just this attitude
that goes with joining a fraternity.

17:58.335 --> 18:01.537
Like they're all junior members
of the Masters of the Universe Club.

18:01.713 --> 18:04.748
Yeah, when really
they're just a bunch of geeks.

18:05.465 --> 18:08.963
lf l ever go to college,
remind me not to join a fraternity.

18:09.134 --> 18:12.133
- lf?
- l don't wanna go.

18:12.303 --> 18:14.010
Come on, of course you do.

18:14.179 --> 18:17.463
No, l don't. And if l ever do go,
l'm definitely not going here.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.383
Why are you so down on this place?

18:21.100 --> 18:24.349
Remember that big modern building
we walked passed on the way in?

18:24.519 --> 18:29.262
- Yeah, it's the Student Centre, right?
- lt's the McKay Student Centre.

18:29.481 --> 18:33.856
- Your father went here?
- No, my dad never went to college.

18:34.025 --> 18:37.641
But when he cut them a cheque,
they gave him a degree.

18:39.237 --> 18:41.608
Well, at least some of his money
went for something good.

18:42.198 --> 18:46.028
He thought that the endowment
would buy him some respectability.

18:48.076 --> 18:49.653
You don't know
how lucky you are, Bren.

18:49.828 --> 18:53.112
You and Brandon, l mean your dad,
he's a straight shooter.

18:53.330 --> 18:54.527
You can trust him.

18:54.747 --> 18:58.114
You can trust his motives.
There are no strings attached.

19:11.175 --> 19:12.798
l think Donna's
made some new friends.

19:12.968 --> 19:16.466
Yeah, yeah, well,
Mooch is a goofball, but he's okay.

19:16.637 --> 19:18.675
Actually, his parents
own half of Orange County.

19:18.847 --> 19:20.755
- lt's not what you know, right?
- That's right.

19:20.931 --> 19:23.218
And you know me.

19:23.391 --> 19:25.347
Come on,
l wanna show you something.

19:25.518 --> 19:28.055
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

19:33.523 --> 19:35.847
- What's this?
- Wait a second.

19:36.025 --> 19:38.894
lt's not like l have a choice.
l can't see anything.

19:43.404 --> 19:46.238
Most girls get dollhouses to play with
when they're little.

19:46.406 --> 19:49.441
My daddy gave me these instead.

19:49.659 --> 19:52.445
This was his very first solo project.

19:52.619 --> 19:57.658
He basically took a dying waterfront
and brought it back to life.

19:57.831 --> 19:59.869
And he won an award for this one.

20:00.040 --> 20:05.079
Well, actually, he won an award
for almost everything in this room.

20:05.252 --> 20:09.876
But as an architecture major,
this one is my favourite, by far.

20:10.047 --> 20:13.414
lt's strong, but it's graceful.

20:13.591 --> 20:15.464
And you stand right here in this spot

20:15.634 --> 20:20.508
and you feel so tiny,
but so empowered.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.012
You know what l mean?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.383
Yeah, l do.

20:43.235 --> 20:44.515
My dad is gonna like you.

20:53.701 --> 20:54.731
Does that matter?

20:56.244 --> 20:58.698
- What?
- Whether or not your dad likes me?

20:58.912 --> 21:02.244
- Well, l guess that depends.
- On what?

21:03.415 --> 21:04.659
On what matters to you.

21:06.084 --> 21:08.621
Brandon, as soon as High Point
gets approval,

21:08.794 --> 21:11.331
things are gonna move very fast.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.120
You'll be right in on the ground floor.

21:15.673 --> 21:17.166
Are you offering me a job?

21:17.383 --> 21:22.257
Well, l don't have the authority
to do that.

21:22.428 --> 21:27.847
But it just so happens my father's
coming into town tomorrow.

21:28.265 --> 21:30.802
For the planning commission hearing.

21:30.975 --> 21:32.385
Right.

21:33.018 --> 21:34.808
ls it really that easy?

21:34.978 --> 21:37.550
l just meet Dickson St. Claire,
and l'm set up for life?

21:38.397 --> 21:41.396
lt's a little more involved than that.

21:42.983 --> 21:44.809
But l think you can handle it.

21:46.068 --> 21:47.775
You're used to getting
everything you want

21:47.945 --> 21:50.269
anytime you want it, aren't you?

21:51.197 --> 21:52.690
Yeah.

21:53.782 --> 21:57.114
You're right.
l'm coming on a little strong, aren't l?

21:58.076 --> 22:03.412
l guess that's sort of the downfall
of being an only child.

22:03.580 --> 22:06.248
You feel like you have to be in control
of every situation

22:07.082 --> 22:09.750
so you don't get disappointed.

22:10.585 --> 22:14.451
Well, l can't say
l'm not impressed by all this.

22:14.629 --> 22:16.620
And flattered. Really.

22:19.215 --> 22:22.962
Why don't we go some place
and celebrate?

22:23.176 --> 22:25.214
l know just the place.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.545
All right, so you got your bun.

22:27.762 --> 22:31.592
You got your burger.
You got your other patty.

22:31.765 --> 22:33.803
A slice of Swiss and American.

22:34.017 --> 22:36.851
You got your tomato, you got your
lettuce, you want Bermuda onions?

22:37.019 --> 22:40.268
- Only if you are.
- Yeah, well, you only live once, sure.

22:40.437 --> 22:43.472
Here we go. Got the top.

22:43.648 --> 22:44.892
Thank you, Willie.

22:45.066 --> 22:47.686
And voila,
The Peach Pit Mega-burger.

22:52.362 --> 22:53.559
That is wonderful.

22:54.071 --> 22:55.979
You know who used to like
her burgers like that?

22:56.156 --> 22:57.186
Marilyn Monroe.

22:57.407 --> 22:58.437
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

22:58.658 --> 23:00.484
She's the one who thought
to add the Swiss.

23:00.659 --> 23:02.033
Go on, tell her, Nat.

23:02.202 --> 23:04.240
Well, she used to come in here
all the time.

23:04.412 --> 23:06.617
And l could always tell
when she was starting a picture

23:06.788 --> 23:09.953
because she would always switch
from fries to cottage cheese.

23:10.165 --> 23:12.868
This place has like real history in it.

23:13.042 --> 23:14.784
Okay, who else
used to come in here?

23:15.752 --> 23:17.993
Montgomery Clift.
And Natalie Wood.

23:18.171 --> 23:20.328
- Sal Mineo.
- Steve McQueen.

23:20.505 --> 23:22.212
Yeah, they're all gone, now.

23:22.423 --> 23:24.747
- They all used to eat right here, huh?
- Yeah.

23:24.967 --> 23:27.670
Now we get the occasional celebrity
stopping by,

23:27.844 --> 23:30.512
but business isn't what it used to be.

23:30.679 --> 23:32.338
Hey, Ruben, take these, please.

23:34.807 --> 23:38.423
l'm very proud of you,
you're moving up in the world.

23:40.310 --> 23:42.978
- Thanks.
- Well, the food's still incredible.

23:43.187 --> 23:45.060
- Enjoy it while you can.
- What do you mean?

23:45.230 --> 23:47.305
- They're tearing this place down.
- Why?

23:47.815 --> 23:49.225
To make room
for High Point Centre.

23:52.443 --> 23:55.976
- Wow, l had no idea.
- That's okay, neither does Nat.

23:56.154 --> 23:59.272
According to my father, that's
the way DSC Development wants it.

24:01.824 --> 24:06.780
So you basically brought me here
just to make me feel bad, is that it?

24:06.953 --> 24:10.901
No, l thought maybe if you, you know,
got a feeling for the place, you could...

24:11.080 --> 24:13.404
l could what,
l could talk to my father?

24:13.624 --> 24:14.654
Yeah, something like that.

24:14.875 --> 24:17.625
Exactly what do you expect
him to do?

24:17.793 --> 24:20.995
Stop two years of research
and development dead in its tracks?

24:21.170 --> 24:24.703
Better yet, have him call the bank and
tell them he's called the whole thing off

24:24.881 --> 24:27.964
because he's tasted
the world's greatest cheeseburger?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.880
l'm sorry, but the real world
doesn't work that way.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.721
Why don't you tell me the way
the real world does work then?

24:36.222 --> 24:38.130
l thought l already did.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.182
Good night, Brandon.

24:54.442 --> 24:57.192
- Hey, Willie.
- Hey, Bran.

25:07.826 --> 25:10.778
- Nat, is that you?
- Hi, pal.

25:10.953 --> 25:13.490
Nice threads, who died?

25:14.414 --> 25:15.528
Come to think of it,

25:15.706 --> 25:19.369
last time l wore this
l put my old man in the ground.

25:19.709 --> 25:21.831
Still fits, though.

25:22.753 --> 25:24.495
But no.

25:24.670 --> 25:28.666
Nobody died. Not yet, anyway.

25:30.299 --> 25:31.958
What are you talking about?

25:33.676 --> 25:35.833
Well, l was gonna have to tell you
sooner or later.

25:36.011 --> 25:38.216
l guess this is as good a time as any.

25:38.430 --> 25:42.805
A developer's got big deal plans
for this neighbourhood.

25:43.683 --> 25:47.346
They're talking about putting in
some ferkockteh shopping centre,

25:47.519 --> 25:48.597
with a lake in the middle.

25:48.811 --> 25:50.269
l don't know.

25:50.479 --> 25:55.055
Anyway, there's a meeting tonight.
And l figured l'd better show up.

25:55.232 --> 25:56.809
Nat...

25:58.192 --> 25:59.222
l knew.

26:00.778 --> 26:02.816
- What?
- My dad's company is involved in it.

26:02.987 --> 26:05.477
lt's called High Point Centre.

26:05.656 --> 26:08.525
l should have told you sooner, l'm
sorry, but my dad put his foot down.

26:08.699 --> 26:12.197
l understand, Brandon.
Business is business.

26:12.410 --> 26:14.069
Talk about coinkydinks.

26:14.245 --> 26:17.197
Listen, you gotta have a lease
on this place, right?

26:17.372 --> 26:19.031
That's the rub.

26:19.206 --> 26:23.665
When l remodelled this joint, l agreed
to some changes in the fine print.

26:23.876 --> 26:26.626
Things aren't as ironclad
as l thought they were.

26:26.795 --> 26:27.957
You gotta fight them on this.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.912
l can't fight them, Brandon.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.623
They're bigger than me.
They're richer than me.

26:33.799 --> 26:36.289
God knows
they got better lawyers than me.

26:36.509 --> 26:38.002
Well, they gotta give you something.

26:38.219 --> 26:40.543
You can take the money
and start over.

26:41.721 --> 26:43.131
lt doesn't work that way, Brandon.

26:43.347 --> 26:46.216
They're gonna squeeze me
until l don't have a pot to cook in.

26:46.433 --> 26:48.223
And at my age...

26:51.519 --> 26:53.510
What am l gonna do?
Get a job at McDonald's?

26:53.687 --> 26:54.801
Nat.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.018
l'm not even gonna go
to this meeting tonight.

26:57.190 --> 26:58.767
l mean, why the hell should l?

26:59.941 --> 27:01.399
There's nothing anyone can do.

27:01.609 --> 27:04.229
Let's face it, after tonight's meeting,

27:05.403 --> 27:06.896
the Peach Pit is history.

27:15.535 --> 27:17.277
Mr. St. Claire is going to say
a few words,

27:17.453 --> 27:19.160
and then he'll toss it to me.

27:19.329 --> 27:21.949
Sounds like you've got
all your ducks in a row.

27:22.123 --> 27:24.245
lsn't that one of your ducklings?

27:31.962 --> 27:33.455
Brandon,
what are you doing here, son?

27:33.630 --> 27:36.879
What, are you kidding? Miss out on
a chance to meet Dickson St. Claire?

27:37.091 --> 27:38.501
lt's not what you know, Dad.

27:38.675 --> 27:40.713
This may not be
the best time, Brandon.

27:40.885 --> 27:43.291
Looks like a perfect time to me.

27:45.221 --> 27:47.545
- Brandon.
- Marcie.

27:48.181 --> 27:50.505
Daddy, this is my friend,
Brandon Walsh.

27:50.683 --> 27:52.591
- He's Jim Walsh's son.
- Dickson St. Claire.

27:52.768 --> 27:54.806
- How are you?
- Your father's been a big help.

27:55.019 --> 27:57.853
Brandon was actually my point man
on the Teen Board, Daddy.

27:58.021 --> 28:01.637
- That was a very fine idea.
- l found it very educational, sir.

28:02.524 --> 28:05.192
Marcie tells me that you share
some of her interests

28:05.359 --> 28:07.600
in architecture and urban planning.

28:07.819 --> 28:11.352
Yeah, l do. Although l think
my favourite subject is history.

28:11.530 --> 28:13.984
Well, l was a history major
at Stanford.

28:14.199 --> 28:16.274
You come talk to me
when you're applying to schools.

28:16.450 --> 28:19.153
- Maybe l can help.
- That's very generous. Thank you.

28:19.369 --> 28:21.277
Daddy, l think they're ready for us.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.779
- A pleasure to meet you.
- Thanks.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.951
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

28:31.793 --> 28:32.907
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:33.086 --> 28:34.959
you have been very patient with me

28:35.129 --> 28:38.081
and l don't want to take up
any more of your time,

28:38.256 --> 28:40.294
but l'd like to thank
my daughter Marcie

28:40.466 --> 28:43.465
who coordinated
the Teen Advisory Board.

28:43.635 --> 28:46.469
Her research provided
many of the innovative aspects

28:46.637 --> 28:48.379
which our plans now include.

28:48.596 --> 28:51.382
ln fact, Marcie,
correct me if l'm wrong,

28:51.598 --> 28:53.803
l don't think you found one teenager

28:53.975 --> 28:56.013
who had a negative response
to our project.

28:56.226 --> 28:58.016
No, not really.

28:58.186 --> 29:00.427
Well, there may have been one, sir.

29:02.814 --> 29:04.722
Excuse me?

29:05.149 --> 29:06.523
Look, l know l'm out of order.

29:06.691 --> 29:09.607
But l worked
on the Student Advisory Board,

29:09.777 --> 29:11.768
and l'm starting to have
second thoughts about it.

29:11.945 --> 29:13.936
Excuse me, young man, but
the community will have

29:14.113 --> 29:16.781
ample opportunity to enter
their thoughts into the public record.

29:16.948 --> 29:18.607
That's good. Somebody should
take the time

29:18.783 --> 29:22.530
to listen to what the little guy has to
say before you let the bulldozers roll in.

29:22.994 --> 29:26.196
l've only lived in L.A. for a year,
but l've been here long enough to see

29:26.371 --> 29:28.244
that somebody better make
some kind of effort

29:28.414 --> 29:30.405
to save what little history
this town has left.

29:30.582 --> 29:33.996
l don't know what's going on here,
Walsh, but control your son.

29:35.836 --> 29:38.160
What kind of stunt do you think
you were pulling in there?

29:38.337 --> 29:39.747
Somebody had to stick up for Nat.

29:39.922 --> 29:41.830
For heaven's sake,
Nat is a grown man.

29:42.006 --> 29:44.543
- lf he was so concerned, where is he?
- l'll tell you where.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.423
He's at the Peach Pit,
trying to figure out

29:46.593 --> 29:48.584
what the hell to do
with the rest of his life.

29:48.761 --> 29:51.251
You were gonna talk to them,
you were gonna take care of Nat.

29:51.429 --> 29:54.631
- l did.
- Obviously you weren't very effective.

29:54.848 --> 29:57.219
Brandon, you don't know
a thing about business.

29:57.391 --> 29:59.715
Now, l did what l could.
Art Peters said they'll pay him

29:59.893 --> 30:01.968
a fair price for his lease.
When High Point's built,

30:02.145 --> 30:04.516
they'll offer him a prime location.
What's wrong with that?

30:04.688 --> 30:06.893
That could take years.
What's he do in the meantime?

30:07.064 --> 30:08.972
Brandon, would you
get off your soapbox?

30:09.149 --> 30:12.184
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to me?

30:12.985 --> 30:15.557
l'm sorry, Dad. l'm sorry
you got caught in the middle,

30:15.737 --> 30:19.187
but you know and l know that
this hearing in here is just a formality.

30:19.739 --> 30:22.110
These people have the juice
to railroad this right through,

30:22.283 --> 30:25.567
no matter what l say,
no matter what anybody says.

30:25.743 --> 30:27.402
Now you told me
to keep my mouth shut.

30:27.578 --> 30:31.159
Said you had everything under control.
Well, l did and you don't.

30:32.123 --> 30:34.791
lt's a free country and l'm not
gonna keep my mouth shut anymore.

30:35.500 --> 30:39.282
Brandon, l respect your passion
and l respect your friendship with Nat.

30:39.461 --> 30:41.915
But you've got to choose
your battles in life, son.

30:43.046 --> 30:44.705
l did.

30:46.924 --> 30:49.876
Yeah, l guess you did.

31:09.397 --> 31:10.855
You guys, that looks great.

31:13.108 --> 31:14.435
What's going on here?

31:15.735 --> 31:17.940
You don't have to fight this
all alone, Ace.

31:18.111 --> 31:20.435
Andrea told us what you did
last night. l'm proud of you.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.604
lf l would've known
they'd tear down the Pit,

31:22.781 --> 31:24.607
l never would've signed up
for the Teen Board.

31:24.782 --> 31:26.987
l been going to the Pit
since l started Little League.

31:27.159 --> 31:28.356
l remember Nat's father.

31:28.535 --> 31:32.116
Oh, me, too. Sal used to sneak me
homemade cookies when l was little.

31:32.913 --> 31:36.078
You know, B, l'm not much
for joining things,

31:36.248 --> 31:38.323
but we can't let this place go.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.827
Andrea, everything's set.

31:40.001 --> 31:42.573
l'm gonna broadcast live
from the Peach Pit this afternoon.

31:42.752 --> 31:45.206
And l'm only gonna be playing music
from Nat's jukebox.

31:45.379 --> 31:47.121
- Cool.
- Very cool.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.876
l talked to my friend at the Times,
she said the Feature desk

31:50.049 --> 31:52.290
might be able to free
someone up to come down.

31:53.801 --> 31:55.342
You guys.

31:55.511 --> 31:57.384
Brandon.

31:58.471 --> 32:01.589
- Can l talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah.

32:04.642 --> 32:08.305
Look, it's bad enough
that we don't see eye-to-eye on this,

32:08.519 --> 32:10.475
but did you have to get
our friends involved?

32:10.646 --> 32:12.684
l didn't ask them, Bren.
They want to help Nat.

32:12.855 --> 32:15.523
Well, what about Dad, Brandon?

32:15.732 --> 32:16.894
l heard him and Mom talking.

32:17.067 --> 32:19.058
They really chewed him out
after the hearing.

32:19.652 --> 32:21.478
l guess he's really had it
with me, huh?

32:21.653 --> 32:23.894
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

32:24.071 --> 32:26.358
As angry as he was with you,

32:26.531 --> 32:28.902
do you know
what l heard him tell Mom?

32:30.033 --> 32:31.610
That you reminded him of Grandpa.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.327
- How's this?
- That looks great, Donna.

32:39.665 --> 32:42.237
Andrea, l'm gonna have to meet
you guys down there after school.

32:42.417 --> 32:43.447
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

32:43.626 --> 32:46.661
lt's just something l gotta
take care of. Bye, guys.

32:46.836 --> 32:48.495
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:07.099 --> 33:09.802
- Brandon, what are you doing here?
- l came to see Art Peters.

33:10.435 --> 33:13.553
l don't understand you.
Where are your loyalties?

33:13.729 --> 33:16.397
Marcie, this has nothing to do
with loyalty.

33:16.564 --> 33:18.223
lt has to do with money and politics.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.894
Two subjects l think
you're quite familiar with.

33:21.067 --> 33:25.442
Fine, fine. lf you wanna be
a knee-jerk bleeding-heart, go ahead.

33:26.029 --> 33:28.601
But don't you for one minute
think you're a threat to my father.

33:28.822 --> 33:30.944
What is it with you and your father?

33:31.115 --> 33:32.857
You're so hung up
being daddy's little girl,

33:33.033 --> 33:35.320
you're afraid to be your own woman.

33:36.702 --> 33:39.785
- Why did you come here anyway?
- To apologise to Art Peters.

33:39.954 --> 33:42.657
To tell him my father had nothing to do
with what l did last night.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.699
Now look who's hung up
on his father.

33:46.876 --> 33:49.745
lt's not the same, Marcie.
And you know that.

33:57.841 --> 33:59.121
Hey, Nat. Where is everybody?

33:59.300 --> 34:02.003
We're supposed to have
a press conference in 1 5 minutes.

34:02.177 --> 34:04.501
- l sent them home.
- Why?

34:05.638 --> 34:09.585
- Sit down. l'll get you a piece of pie--
- Hey, hold on, tell me what's going on.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.554
They made me an offer
l couldn't refuse.

34:14.143 --> 34:16.847
You know, business is business.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.723
So, what about everything you said?
What about the Pit?

34:21.190 --> 34:23.940
lt was a fair offer.
l mean they could have stiffed me.

34:24.108 --> 34:26.349
That's it, they offer you
a lot of money and you're out?

34:26.568 --> 34:29.935
l know what you were trying to do
for me and l love you for it.

34:30.362 --> 34:33.860
But things have a strange way
of working out sometimes.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.228
So, what's everybody gonna do?

34:36.867 --> 34:40.032
l'll take care of Willie,
Ruben and the girls.

34:40.202 --> 34:42.572
- Give them a little severance.
- What about you?

34:42.786 --> 34:44.743
l'll manage.

34:45.956 --> 34:48.197
Maybe l'll buy a boat, sail away.

34:48.791 --> 34:54.375
Yeah, ever since l got out of the Navy
l've always wanted to see the world.

34:56.045 --> 34:58.002
Maybe when you get out
of high school,

34:58.173 --> 35:01.375
you can be my first mate,
if you want.

35:01.717 --> 35:02.747
You let me down, Nat.

35:04.677 --> 35:07.131
l thought we were fighting
for something important.

35:07.304 --> 35:08.678
Something bigger than you and me.

35:10.472 --> 35:13.092
But guess l was wrong.
lt's not the first time.

35:26.566 --> 35:29.234
That bacon smells great. How about
making me one of those things?

35:29.401 --> 35:32.436
Here, why don't you just take this one.
l'm not real hungry anyway.

35:32.612 --> 35:35.944
Brandon, how long
are you planning to shut me out?

35:36.656 --> 35:38.813
You said your piece last night.
Let it go.

35:38.991 --> 35:41.611
- lt's over and done with.
- Yeah, l guess it is.

35:41.785 --> 35:43.776
- Congratulations.
- For what?

35:43.994 --> 35:45.653
Come on, Dad.
We both know what happened.

35:45.829 --> 35:47.655
St. Claire went and
threw so much money at Nat

35:47.830 --> 35:50.402
- that it turned his head around.
- Brandon, your life is based

35:50.582 --> 35:52.408
on so many false assumptions,
it's staggering.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.120
Please, do we have to go through
all this again?

35:55.335 --> 35:58.833
Yes, because l'm fed up with Brandon
accusing me of being the villain here.

35:59.004 --> 36:01.161
First of all, this may come
as a surprise to you.

36:01.339 --> 36:03.081
But Art Peters and Dickson St. Claire

36:03.257 --> 36:05.628
actually make decisions
without consulting me.

36:05.800 --> 36:10.294
Second of all, Nat made a deal.
What is wrong with that?

36:10.512 --> 36:13.132
So it's all about the bottom line, huh?

36:14.389 --> 36:16.297
You, Nat, St. Claire,
you're all the same.

36:16.516 --> 36:19.883
That's right. We are all the same.

36:20.060 --> 36:22.431
We all have responsibilities.

36:22.645 --> 36:24.222
We all have to worry
about boring things

36:24.396 --> 36:28.606
like mortgages and meeting payrolls
and putting food on the table.

36:29.066 --> 36:31.472
Brandon, think about it.
lf High Point Centre goes through,

36:31.651 --> 36:33.642
it'll create hundreds,
maybe thousands of jobs.

36:33.819 --> 36:36.735
That's a lot of bacon, lettuce,
and tomato sandwiches.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.524
Gee, thanks for explaining that
to me, Dad.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.781
Otherwise,
l may have never figured it out.

36:45.785 --> 36:47.611
Poor Brandon.

36:47.786 --> 36:50.988
Poor Brandon? What about me?

36:51.163 --> 36:52.241
ln the past 24 hours,

36:52.414 --> 36:55.497
l've been accused of being
Simon Legree, lvan Boesky,

36:55.666 --> 36:58.334
and the Sheriff of Nottingham
all rolled up into one.

36:58.502 --> 37:00.410
Oh, Jim. lt can't compare.

37:00.586 --> 37:03.835
l mean, he's lost a hero today.

37:05.089 --> 37:08.421
Yeah, he thinks l let him down.

37:09.884 --> 37:13.832
Jim, l was talking about Nat.

37:14.929 --> 37:17.501
You're right. l've been replaced.

37:19.474 --> 37:22.676
So, Nat took the deal?

37:22.851 --> 37:25.519
Yeah, l wonder what they gave him.
Probably a lot.

37:25.686 --> 37:28.354
- That property is worth a fortune.
- Great.

37:30.064 --> 37:32.554
- You know, l'm gonna miss that place.
- Yeah.

37:32.732 --> 37:35.815
Well, not half as much
as Brandon will.

37:42.989 --> 37:45.313
Hey, Jim. Cindy called.

37:45.491 --> 37:48.905
- l got your pie. Let me box it for you.
- Thanks.

37:52.912 --> 37:55.947
- Here we are.
- Great.

37:56.456 --> 37:59.124
- Pretty good crowd tonight.
- Yeah, just my luck.

37:59.292 --> 38:01.912
Business is picking up
as we're closing down.

38:03.253 --> 38:07.165
- Put it away, it's on the house.
- Thanks, Nat.

38:07.380 --> 38:10.415
l'm just thankful that some
of the Walshes are still talking to me.

38:10.632 --> 38:14.082
Yeah, Brandon's pretty bitter
about this.

38:14.718 --> 38:18.132
l can't blame him.
He fought for me and l crumbled.

38:18.304 --> 38:20.342
Don't beat yourself up.
You did what you had to do.

38:20.514 --> 38:23.300
Yeah, but l never thought
l'd feel lousy about being lucky.

38:26.226 --> 38:30.092
- Say, would you do me a favour?
- Sure.

38:30.270 --> 38:32.012
Anything, you name it.

38:32.188 --> 38:34.808
Well, l got these papers
from the St. Claire people.

38:35.023 --> 38:37.595
l gave them to my attorney.

38:38.859 --> 38:42.902
But l was just wondering
if you could take a look at them, if...

38:45.655 --> 38:47.278
Let me see them.

38:54.995 --> 38:56.275
This is what they offered you?

38:56.454 --> 39:00.117
l asked for a favour on this one, Art,
and what do you do? You lowball him.

39:00.332 --> 39:02.786
Your friend Bussichio
accepted our first offer.

39:02.958 --> 39:06.123
What was l supposed to do? Tell him
that he should be asking for more?

39:06.336 --> 39:08.078
Besides, it might be
a moot point anyway.

39:08.254 --> 39:09.451
What are you talking about?

39:09.630 --> 39:11.372
Haven't you checked
your voicemail?

39:11.547 --> 39:12.791
Not since l left the office.

39:13.882 --> 39:15.957
You better come in, Jim.

39:16.175 --> 39:18.665
We have a lot to talk about.

39:28.142 --> 39:29.172
Where did you go?

39:29.351 --> 39:32.019
l rode my bike down
San Vicente to the beach.

39:32.186 --> 39:34.177
Had to clear my head.

39:35.146 --> 39:36.972
What's going on?

39:39.649 --> 39:41.391
Brandon...

39:41.776 --> 39:43.981
...the money for the High Point Centre
fell through.

39:44.194 --> 39:46.185
You gotta be kidding me. That's great.

39:46.404 --> 39:49.403
Yeah, well, he doesn't share
your same enthusiasm.

39:49.614 --> 39:52.448
l'd grim up before l went in there
if l were you.

39:52.616 --> 39:56.279
And, Brandon,
l just want to say one thing.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.450
l love Dad a lot.

39:59.120 --> 40:02.285
And l wanted this project
to happen for him.

40:03.582 --> 40:06.250
But l'm really glad the Peach Pit
is still gonna be there.

40:07.417 --> 40:09.290
Yeah, me too.

40:10.545 --> 40:14.920
l want you to know one thing,
you were right to stand by Dad.

40:16.465 --> 40:18.042
Thanks.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.843
We told DSC that the deal
could fall through

40:25.054 --> 40:26.927
and nobody took us seriously.

40:27.806 --> 40:30.509
When l tried to tell Art Peters
about this,

40:31.392 --> 40:33.549
you know what he
told me, Brandon?

40:35.936 --> 40:39.635
He said l wasn't a team player.
Do you know how that made me feel?

40:41.231 --> 40:43.222
l think l'm starting to get an idea.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.557
What did l expect?

40:47.986 --> 40:50.736
They never listen
to the bean counters.

40:52.030 --> 40:54.354
All they want us to do
is crunch the numbers

40:54.532 --> 40:55.729
and make them look good.

40:56.575 --> 40:58.234
Are you gonna
come out of this okay?

40:58.451 --> 41:00.692
You mean am l gonna get fired?

41:04.121 --> 41:06.955
No, probably not.

41:08.708 --> 41:12.371
But even if l did, you don't have
to worry about your old man.

41:14.336 --> 41:19.245
l may never make the big bucks,
but l've learned to play the game.

41:21.967 --> 41:25.749
And from what l've seen
this past week...

41:26.803 --> 41:28.545
...l'd say you're a chip
off the old block.

41:29.180 --> 41:30.839
Thanks.

41:31.931 --> 41:35.547
Don't let it go to your head,
you're still wet behind the ears.

41:35.892 --> 41:40.267
- Guess l went a little overboard, huh?
- Yeah, you did.

41:42.272 --> 41:44.809
But your grandpa
wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

41:47.817 --> 41:51.647
- Does Nat know about this yet?
- Not yet.

42:02.035 --> 42:04.607
Brandon, what are you doing here?

42:04.828 --> 42:07.827
l thought l'd come by
and help you clean the place out.

42:07.997 --> 42:11.411
Thanks, pal. l didn't think
l'd get to see you here again.

42:11.582 --> 42:13.953
What, are you kidding?
And miss the fire sale?

42:14.126 --> 42:16.367
Did you call
the restaurant supply company?

42:16.544 --> 42:20.160
You could probably get 50 cents
on the dollar for most of this stuff.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.749
That's not a bad idea.

42:22.965 --> 42:25.289
Hey, you know this may be
a real collectable item someday.

42:25.467 --> 42:29.463
- Mind if l keep one of these, Nat?
- Yeah, sure.

42:30.512 --> 42:32.468
Help yourself.

42:32.930 --> 42:37.590
Brandon, you know,
l never put this place up for sale.

42:37.766 --> 42:40.434
- They came to me.
- l know.

42:40.852 --> 42:44.054
Everybody hopes for that pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow,

42:44.229 --> 42:47.228
but l never asked for this,
you gotta know that.

42:48.023 --> 42:50.595
You know what you ought to do, Nat,
you ought to have an auction.

42:50.775 --> 42:53.312
Get an auctioneer, you could
probably sell most of this stuff.

42:53.485 --> 42:55.144
Probably get top dollar for it too.

42:56.487 --> 42:58.229
You're getting a good head
for business.

42:58.405 --> 43:00.859
l know what you should do
with these pictures on the wall.

43:01.032 --> 43:02.774
You should donate them
to the county museum,

43:02.950 --> 43:04.443
that way you get a huge tax break.

43:04.617 --> 43:06.692
Especially for the autographed one
of Steve McQueen.

43:06.869 --> 43:09.987
What's gotten into you? You can't
put a price on something like that.

43:10.204 --> 43:13.571
Oh, come on, Nat,
everything has its price.

43:18.043 --> 43:19.584
l guess l deserved that one, huh?

43:19.752 --> 43:21.459
- Nat--
- lt's okay.

43:22.171 --> 43:26.665
l've been a heel. l mean,
l sold you kids out for short money.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.878
You must think l'm disgusting,
l don't blame you.

43:29.050 --> 43:32.464
- Nat--
- Let me get it off my chest, okay?

43:32.636 --> 43:35.007
- l really hate myself for what l--
- Nat!

43:36.555 --> 43:38.013
The deal fell through.

43:38.598 --> 43:40.471
They aren't building
the High Point Centre.

43:40.641 --> 43:42.928
- What?
- You heard, no High Point Centre.

43:43.977 --> 43:45.767
- You're kidding.
- No.

43:45.936 --> 43:47.595
The Peach Pit
is open for business, pal.

43:48.896 --> 43:50.934
That's the best news
l've ever heard in my life,

43:51.148 --> 43:54.266
and l'm never gonna forget
who l heard it from.

43:58.153 --> 44:00.524
Nothing could possibly
make me happier.

44:00.696 --> 44:01.858
You wanna bet?

44:02.030 --> 44:04.484
Hey, guys, come on in.
lt's showtime.

44:04.699 --> 44:06.276
- All right!
- Yeah.

44:07.075 --> 44:09.529
Nat, l'm so glad
things worked out for you.

44:09.702 --> 44:11.409
All right, hey, give him some loving.

44:11.995 --> 44:13.275
- Great, great.
- Thank you.

44:13.454 --> 44:15.077
- Thanks, thanks.
- Oh, Nat.

44:15.247 --> 44:16.574
Congratulations, Nat.

44:16.748 --> 44:18.574
- Couldn't get rid of you.
- Thanks, Jim.

44:18.791 --> 44:21.743
Paisan, what do l gotta do
to get a little service around here, huh?

44:21.918 --> 44:23.541
Willie, fire up the grill.

44:23.711 --> 44:26.461
- All right.
- You got it.

44:30.049 --> 44:31.672
Music to my ears.

44:33.176 --> 44:35.002
Hi, thanks. Hi.

44:35.177 --> 44:38.461
Thank you. Excuse me, thanks.
