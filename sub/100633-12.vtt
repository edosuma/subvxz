to be taken down.

and scented alarm clocks.

turned into a cake mixer

is so powerful,
that when I kiss you,

16:38.264 --> 16:39.466
it will break Psycho's spell.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.702
On your command...

20:02.769 --> 20:04.503
-[device beeps]
-...my armies
shall spring forth

20:04.570 --> 20:05.940
and enslave the planet.

20:06.006 --> 20:08.976
The Earth is yours,
Harley Quinn.

20:10.978 --> 20:13.313
Thanks, but no thanks.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.248
Psycho, the creep
that he is, he was right.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.617
I don't wanna rule Earth
on a throne of skulls.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.521
I'm not a real supervillain.

20:19.521 --> 20:21.721
Hell, I'm not sure
I'm even a bad guy
anymore.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.355
All I've been doing
is reacting.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.692
Getting in the Legion of Doom
to show up Joker.

20:25.759 --> 20:27.661
Stopping the Injustice League
to get revenge.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.596
It's 'cause, deep inside,

20:29.663 --> 20:31.932
I didn't know
what I really wanted,
until now.

20:31.999 --> 20:35.701
Your indecision baffles
and angers me.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.770
For this,
I shall return one day

20:37.770 --> 20:40.874
and terraform your planet
into a scrapyard.

20:40.941 --> 20:42.843
Well, that seems ominous.

20:42.843 --> 20:45.011
All right, pop back
in your Boom Tube.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.980
Darkseid is...

20:47.047 --> 20:48.548
leaving.

20:50.584 --> 20:53.053
Ivy, you call me out
on all my bullshit,

20:53.119 --> 20:54.721
but you don't
judge me for it.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.388
We have fun whether
we're sitting on the couch

20:56.388 --> 20:58.424
or murdering a group
of investment bankers.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.994
You showed me
what the best version
of myself could be

21:01.060 --> 21:02.663
and you held me to it.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.431
I'm in love with you.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.066
I want to be with you.

21:06.133 --> 21:09.336
And, yes, it might be messy.
It might not work.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.006
It might even destroy
our friendship forever.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.807
But love is a risk.

21:13.874 --> 21:15.230
I'd rather risk our friendship

21:15.230 --> 21:16.943
than pretend
these feelings aren't real.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.679
You just, you don't
give up on love.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.013
Take a risk,

21:20.079 --> 21:22.682
take a leap of faith,
and be with me.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.050
[Kite Man groans]

21:24.117 --> 21:26.086
Hey, did my kiss work?

21:26.153 --> 21:27.688
Where am I?

21:27.753 --> 21:30.423
[Dr. Psycho laughs maniacally]

21:30.490 --> 21:32.925
We're laughing?
Are we friends again?

21:32.992 --> 21:34.528
What is so funny?

21:34.528 --> 21:36.630
Aw, man, I hate
missing inside jokes!

21:36.696 --> 21:38.531
Oh, don't worry,

21:38.597 --> 21:39.967
I'll tell you.

21:40.034 --> 21:41.367
[Dr. Psycho screams]

21:44.038 --> 21:45.672
[laughs maniacally]

21:45.739 --> 21:47.374
[Poison Ivy and Harley moaning]

21:49.576 --> 21:50.777
Whoa!

21:50.844 --> 21:53.012
Oh, this is gonna affect
the crew dynamic

21:53.079 --> 21:56.348
in a messy
and complicated manner.

21:56.415 --> 22:00.452
I already had a feeling.
The tension was palpable.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.523
[laughs] She's still limber.

22:07.094 --> 22:09.528
[Dr. Psycho grunting]

22:09.596 --> 22:11.097
Ooh! I need a cigarette.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.365
[groans]

22:17.770 --> 22:18.770
Um...
