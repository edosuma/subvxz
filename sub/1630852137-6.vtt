WEBVTT

00:05.600 --> 00:07.160
After the Christmas break,

00:07.240 --> 00:09.480
the championship
enters its decisive phase.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.160
Two, one, go.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.800
The pressure for Juventus is overwhelming.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.280
Duels with bitter rivals,
and comrades turned into adversaries

00:17.360 --> 00:19.560
multiplied the difficulties for Pirlo.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.520
Headshot. Ball in the net.
Goal for Arturo Vidal.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.600
But the group shows its strength

00:24.680 --> 00:27.040
by winning the first trophy of the season.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.520
Morata!

00:29.640 --> 00:32.640
Juventus wins the Italian Super Cup!

00:32.720 --> 00:35.160
Will Juventus continue
on its winning path?

00:35.240 --> 00:37.760
Champions, champions

00:37.920 --> 00:39.920
New challenges await the team.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.920
Maybe it's a good year for the Champions.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.520
And I have so much confidence in Pirlo.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.000
Imagine if we reach
the Champions League with Pirlo.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.200
To win the Champions League…

01:13.800 --> 01:16.760
In addition to skill,
you also need a lot of luck.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.040
It's almost an obsession now, that cup.

01:22.440 --> 01:27.360
It's a party. Vialli kisses and raises it
to the sky above Rome. The Champions Cup!

01:28.360 --> 01:31.280
Juventus has won
the Champions League twice.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.840
The victory against Ajax in 1996

01:35.920 --> 01:39.040
was one of the most important moments
in Juventus history.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.200
It was the greatest joy, really.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.400
The party began, first outside
the stadium, then all over Rome.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.280
We hadn't even seen this many people
when Italy won the World Cup.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.000
Juventus, Juventus

01:57.800 --> 01:58.920
But since that day,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.320
Juventus has lost five finals.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.920
More than any other team
in the history of the competition.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.760
I want to break this curse.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.600
It's a cursed streak.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.320
Priority to the cursed one. The Champions.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.440
The Champions League
is an obsession for Juventus fans.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.680
It brings up so many emotions.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.080
It brings up fear,

02:31.280 --> 02:32.880
but also enthusiasm,

02:33.080 --> 02:35.560
the dream, the aspiration, the hope...

02:36.440 --> 02:39.760
Only tears for Juventus
since the '96 in Champions League.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.600
Sooner or later we have to win it.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Until the end,

02:47.360 --> 02:48.520
you can always hope.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.800
After nine League titles,

02:52.080 --> 02:54.240
winning the trophy this year

02:54.760 --> 02:58.840
would be the perfect end to a cycle.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.760
It would give the blessing

03:01.840 --> 03:05.320
of perfection
to an already legendary story.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.440
After 25 years,

03:15.520 --> 03:17.640
Juventus wants to try to win back

03:17.760 --> 03:19.800
the most coveted trophy in soccer.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.400
Nice!

03:25.640 --> 03:27.480
Who is more handsome, me or him?

03:27.560 --> 03:30.440
You are more handsome,
but more skilled is better.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.680
Me or Giorgio?

03:31.760 --> 03:33.200
No, you're more handsome.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.960
For me Giorgio's okay,
but I am more handsome.

03:38.240 --> 03:39.320
In 48 hours,

03:39.560 --> 03:42.440
Juventus will meet the champions of Porto,

03:42.760 --> 03:46.840
in the first of two matches to decide
who'll go to the quarter finals.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
They have players

03:49.640 --> 03:52.520
skilled in technical play, and fast.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.400
They have interesting young people,
but also experienced players.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.360
It will be a tough match.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.280
Juventus veterans,

04:03.440 --> 04:06.400
Giorgio Chiellini,
Leonardo Bonucci and Gigi Buffon,

04:06.800 --> 04:09.360
have won almost every major trophy,

04:09.680 --> 04:11.360
except for the Champions League.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.120
The Champions League...

04:15.200 --> 04:16.520
GIANLUIGI BUFFON
GOALIE

04:16.640 --> 04:19.240
...is the competition that gives me

04:19.320 --> 04:22.120
motivation, gives me joy,
and enthusiasm to play.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.560
I realize that when I'm in Champions,
I have fun, I get excited,

04:27.800 --> 04:28.920
and I feel good.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
For the veterans,

04:31.880 --> 04:35.600
this may be the last chance
to win the trophy together.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.920
Every year,
we older guys really go for it,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.240
because you don't know
what can happen next year,

04:42.360 --> 04:44.160
or if you'll have any more chances.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.240
I'm sure that this club has what it takes

04:48.320 --> 04:50.800
to achieve this goal, and in the meantime

04:50.880 --> 04:54.360
the first objective
is to finish in the top eight.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.080
Juventus arrives at the match

04:58.160 --> 05:01.520
after one of the most exhausting
schedules in its history.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.240
We've had 13 games in 41 days.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.800
That's almost a round.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.240
Come on, come on, come on.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.640
Pass it fast, pass it fast, Giorgio.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.200
No!

05:15.040 --> 05:16.040
Giorgio is tired.

05:17.240 --> 05:21.920
Leo, let's not force passages through,
or they'll close us down and start again.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.240
Go!

05:35.840 --> 05:38.560
Forty-eight hours
before the trip to Portugal...

05:38.640 --> 05:39.640
What is it?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.840
...Pirlo receives a major blow.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.240
Behind the knee?

05:43.680 --> 05:45.320
Let's go! More on the cut!

05:47.200 --> 05:48.680
Vice-captain Bonucci

05:49.000 --> 05:50.680
got injured in training.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.280
It's tough.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.640
It's been that kind of year.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.600
He was already hurting.

06:03.040 --> 06:03.960
Is it the knee?

06:04.240 --> 06:06.240
Yes. Where he always got hurt.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.120
It never healed.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.200
It was kind of my fault,

06:16.640 --> 06:19.480
because I knew I was on the edge.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.200
I had been having discomfort for a while,

06:23.280 --> 06:24.960
and I tried to handle it,

06:25.880 --> 06:28.280
and today it showed up.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.520
It happens. It's what we do.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.400
I forced it a bit to be there,
to play this game.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.440
It was meant to be.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.280
Pirlo, as a player,

06:47.440 --> 06:49.360
won the competition twice,

06:50.280 --> 06:52.480
but it's his first experience as a coach

06:52.560 --> 06:54.320
in the elimination phase.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.760
Juve can't go out

06:57.840 --> 07:00.120
in the round of sixteenth
of the Champions League

07:00.200 --> 07:02.280
against a team like Porto.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.160
We are sure we are better than them.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.440
So we need to seize the moment.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.480
For Ronaldo,
the match is a return to his homeland,

07:19.880 --> 07:21.520
where it all began.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.080
Ronaldo aims to win the Champions again,

07:44.600 --> 07:46.800
to reach the record of six victories.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.600
PORTO
FEBRUARY 17, 2021

08:07.680 --> 08:10.080
The Champions League begins again,

08:10.280 --> 08:11.840
and anything can happen.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.560
The no-appeal phase begins,

08:14.840 --> 08:16.800
and you can't make mistakes.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.440
Juventus is the favorite.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.520
They never lost to Porto,

08:21.600 --> 08:23.960
the four times they faced them.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.960
Ronaldo… Juventus charges immediately.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.280
Watch out for Porto.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.400
Show yourself, Rodri!

08:38.160 --> 08:39.080
It's coming!

08:39.240 --> 08:41.240
Bentancur. The risk… look out!

08:43.080 --> 08:44.040
Ball in the net.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.120
Porto takes the lead,

08:47.200 --> 08:50.520
in the first minute with Taremi's goal.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.760
It's the worst possible start
for Juventus.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.480
After just one minute of play,

08:57.520 --> 08:59.080
they are losing.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.720
Look out, a physical problem
for the Juventus captain, Chiellini.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.520
Things go from bad to worse…

09:11.120 --> 09:12.880
when the captain, Chiellini,

09:13.280 --> 09:15.200
leaves the field with an injury.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.600
Chiellini finishes his match this way.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.320
Here we go. All set.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.120
And off we go again.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.720
Enjoy this second half of Porto-Juventus.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.760
Marega!

09:37.880 --> 09:40.160
The second half begins like the first.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.160
Twenty seconds on the clock.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.640
Juventus takes a goal
one minute after the kickoff.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.080
It's a depressing night for Ronaldo,

09:52.280 --> 09:54.400
who fails to make a difference.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.000
Go, you've got it!

09:59.720 --> 10:02.640
Sergio Oliveira, Szczęsny!

10:05.640 --> 10:08.120
The veterans' dream is being shattered.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.120
Juventus sees a shocking defeat ahead.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.280
De Ligt brings it forward.
Wide ball for Alex Sandro.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.880
Alex Sandro… Nice ball to Rabiot,

10:19.080 --> 10:23.400
Rabiot aims at the goal, puts it
in the middle on the other side, Chiesa!

10:24.040 --> 10:27.320
Fuck yeah!

10:28.240 --> 10:29.280
Chiesa's goal

10:29.520 --> 10:31.520
reopens the game for Juventus.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.080
We're within injury time. Demiral.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.600
Go for it!

10:38.000 --> 10:40.240
Porto behind the line, de Ligt,

10:40.600 --> 10:42.320
Ronaldo, watch out, kicks!

10:48.400 --> 10:52.000
Look out, contact!
The referee says nothing, look out!

10:52.640 --> 10:54.840
This contact needs to be reviewed!

10:55.160 --> 10:56.760
They must be evaluating it.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.240
The referee stops everything.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.280
And it ends there.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.200
Two to one.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.000
The referee signals the end,

11:10.080 --> 11:12.320
without reviewing the contact on the VAR.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.520
Did you whistle?

11:20.160 --> 11:22.240
Why didn't you check the VAR? Why?

11:24.720 --> 11:27.920
You have to check the VAR! You have to!

11:28.760 --> 11:30.960
It's a hard defeat to swallow,

11:33.160 --> 11:34.920
but the final score of 2 to 1

11:35.000 --> 11:37.840
leaves some hope of recovering...

11:38.040 --> 11:39.520
Porto!

11:39.600 --> 11:40.840
...in the return leg.

11:50.680 --> 11:55.800
A goal in the first minute of such
an important match is unacceptable.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.920
There is too much bitterness.
I can't talk. It's too soon.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.360
Ronaldo was disappointing.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.680
It was an off day.
It can happen to him, too.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.000
The only one who made a difference
was Chiesa.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.920
I'm not saying Pirlo isn't capable,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.040
but I see him as very composed.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.400
At times you need to make yourself heard.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.560
It was tough, ugly...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.040
-I didn't like it.
-I didn't expect it.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.720
Andrea was down.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.360
He was disappointed.
He didn't expect it either.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.800
Luckily we scored.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.040
I was angry because

12:45.800 --> 12:49.840
we had prepared a game
in a totally different way.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.760
But when you get a goal after a minute,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.640
things change.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.760
But we're still in the race.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.920
We need to have a clear head
to prepare well,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.480
because we can still
move to the next round.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.440
It's not over yet, because Chiesa's goal

13:07.520 --> 13:09.240
had a gigantic impact.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.200
FEDERICO CHIESA
FORWARD

13:14.280 --> 13:17.440
So as of today the qualification is 50/50,

13:17.680 --> 13:19.760
for sure 50/50.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.600
Chiesa is confirmed to be
instrumental for Juventus.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.200
I take a while to get started
in the morning. I'm a little...

13:32.720 --> 13:35.320
Despite the lackluster results
of the team.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.120
It really does seem

13:38.760 --> 13:39.680
like a paradox,

13:39.800 --> 13:42.000
but it was truly

13:42.880 --> 13:44.720
a night to forget,

13:44.840 --> 13:47.120
but, of course, that happens

13:47.600 --> 13:48.800
in soccer.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.680
The goals, the good performances,

13:51.920 --> 13:55.000
you put them aside.
Now there's the next game,

13:55.320 --> 13:57.880
and you have to improve
here, here and here.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.600
When you get here, that's the mentality.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.520
That's what the senators show.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.800
As of today,

14:06.880 --> 14:10.080
I am young, just starting out,
and I have a lot to learn.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.000
Juventus players are

14:12.080 --> 14:14.040
Giorgio, Leo, those who

14:14.160 --> 14:17.080
have been here for a few years,
and have won a lot.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.880
They played in important finals.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.920
This year I won the Super Cup,

14:22.520 --> 14:26.800
and I'm very happy
because it was my first trophy,

14:27.280 --> 14:31.320
but there's still a long way to go.
The mountain

14:31.400 --> 14:33.080
is really high to climb.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.600
Within 48 hours,

14:40.760 --> 14:43.200
Juventus lost both Bonucci and Chiellini,

14:43.560 --> 14:44.880
who were both injured.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.960
A bit here… a lot.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.720
Does it hurt here?

14:51.960 --> 14:53.040
Not pleasant, huh?

14:53.160 --> 14:54.880
No, it's not pleasant.

14:55.560 --> 14:59.160
The calf injury that stopped
Chiellini for part of the season

14:59.240 --> 15:00.520
has worsened.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.240
I pushed it hard
in a contrast with Marega.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.880
Did you feel that?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.360
It's when you feel stung.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.120
The hope, clearly,

15:13.160 --> 15:16.280
is to be fully fit for the return leg

15:16.520 --> 15:18.280
with Porto.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.240
Two or three days before is even better.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.320
It's a race against time

15:25.440 --> 15:28.360
to have both players ready
for the return leg,

15:28.680 --> 15:29.920
in three weeks.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.000
I'm sorry because

15:33.360 --> 15:35.720
it's an important game, and in the end

15:36.440 --> 15:38.280
I couldn't help

15:38.920 --> 15:39.760
my teammates.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.440
There is great disappointment,
and that's okay.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.680
You can only work,

15:47.120 --> 15:51.680
and talk about facts. We have other games
before the rematch…

15:52.480 --> 15:55.240
against Porto.
The only way is to win, period.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.800
Let's start to accelerate and come back!

16:00.880 --> 16:02.440
These three, four steps!

16:03.280 --> 16:04.680
One, two, three, four!

16:05.680 --> 16:07.680
The season continues unabated.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.560
Always talking.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.160
We have things to do.

16:14.280 --> 16:17.840
The team returns to practice
for the next four games,

16:18.240 --> 16:20.400
before the match against Porto.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.160
If it goes out one millimeter,
it's out, okay?

16:23.240 --> 16:25.080
If we're gonna act like prodigies.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.880
We all ask ourselves
if Ronaldo is a fluke.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.960
In my opinion,
with Porto he was one of the worst.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.960
It's clear that Ronaldo's trend

16:35.040 --> 16:36.640
this season

16:36.960 --> 16:39.040
is downward instead of upward.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.000
It's much better to have him, though.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.000
Ronaldo got a lot of criticism
after the match,

16:46.080 --> 16:49.680
because they always expect him
to score and win.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.520
Unfortunately, there are games…

16:53.000 --> 16:56.960
when you can't give 100%,
and the team doesn't win.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.440
TURIN
JULY 2018

17:01.520 --> 17:05.800
Cristiano!

17:06.560 --> 17:08.720
Ronaldo was acquired from Real Madrid

17:08.800 --> 17:11.760
in 2018 for €112 million.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.040
A record figure
for a player over 30 years old.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.880
Bring us, bring us
Bring us the Champions

17:19.000 --> 17:23.520
He was seen as the missing piece
for the team to achieve perfection.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.640
Let's say that Ronaldo has been...

17:26.720 --> 17:29.080
a very big cherry on the cake, of course.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.160
Probably the best soccer player

17:34.640 --> 17:36.080
in the history of soccer,

17:36.440 --> 17:38.480
with an unparalleled

17:39.080 --> 17:40.200
winning mentality.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.280
Ronaldo has raised
the expectations of fans,

17:45.320 --> 17:47.800
given his five Champions League victories.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.320
But since his arrival,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.800
Juventus has never made it past
the quarter finals.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.480
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 2019 - QUARTER FINALS

18:00.560 --> 18:01.640
The conclusion.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.320
The goal for Lyon.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.560
Now it's really hard for Juventus.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.880
Juventus, third in the rankings,
seven points from the first,

18:14.960 --> 18:17.400
faces a decisive series of games.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.560
Juventus!

18:19.760 --> 18:23.160
The spearhead of the team
must return to its splendor

18:23.280 --> 18:27.480
or all hopes a tenth consecutive
championship could fade entirely.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.680
We can't ask the impossible of Ronaldo.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.800
In the games that mattered,

18:56.080 --> 18:57.320
he was always there.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.640
So it's enough
that he's here to do what he's doing.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.560
He's setting the ball up.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.640
Alex Sandro wants to come up
with something.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.440
Alex Sandro, crosses towards Ronaldo!

19:14.960 --> 19:16.560
Juventus takes the lead.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.560
Juventus 1, Crotone 0.
Cristiano Ronaldo back to scoring.

19:23.200 --> 19:29.040
…comes towards Ronaldo, aims at the goal,
right kick. Cordaz… It's not over.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.080
Ronaldo puts it in the net with his head.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.400
Him again! CR7 again!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.480
He looks for Chiesa,
who aims for the goal.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.040
Chiesa, low kick to Ronaldo. Ronaldo!

19:46.080 --> 19:47.800
Juventus take the lead!

19:48.760 --> 19:52.040
And it will be his 19th
goal in the league.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.280
Bentancur, cross,

19:59.320 --> 20:03.280
three on one, Bentancur,
in for Ronaldo, aims at the goal,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.560
Ronaldo! Juventus 3,

20:06.800 --> 20:10.080
Spezia 0!
The king's goal has also arrived.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.800
Ronaldo is back in great shape,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.480
and with four goals in three games,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.560
keeps Juventus in the running
for the title.

20:26.440 --> 20:30.000
Ronaldo… We are here, we enjoy him,

20:30.440 --> 20:32.960
because these kinds of champions are like

20:33.200 --> 20:35.880
thoroughbred horses that you admire

20:36.320 --> 20:38.880
at your ranch or in your garden.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040
Like having a Picasso painting

20:41.520 --> 20:43.920
in your house and seeing it every day.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.200
If it becomes

20:45.320 --> 20:49.080
a given for you, you are the problem.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.240
-Stop it, Manu!
-Shut up!

21:00.320 --> 21:01.320
Ouch!

21:02.400 --> 21:04.720
An hour of this, you lose motivation.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.480
Less than a week away from the return,

21:08.560 --> 21:09.800
Bonucci and Chiellini

21:09.880 --> 21:12.560
are still struggling
to recover from their injuries.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.320
-Morning!
-Morning, guys.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.320
Good morning, how are you?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.040
A mess.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.800
Nice and loose.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.400
Out of nowhere, the back.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.880
Never mind.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.080
It's more interesting over there.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.160
It is more interesting to see
the suffering.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.400
I like you when you whine.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.440
Enough!

21:39.760 --> 21:40.960
Pavel, good morning.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.960
-How are we doing over here?
-Hi.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.520
-Here's the RSA.
-Look at them.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.000
They used to look like players.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.480
Now we give him a massage,

21:52.760 --> 21:54.280
a bit of swimming pool...

21:54.320 --> 21:57.000
-There's the sauna.
-A bit of sun.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.880
It's the life you live.
You could do the same!

22:02.240 --> 22:03.600
Giorgio, Gigi, Leo

22:03.720 --> 22:06.320
have great qualities as men.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.040
Even though

22:08.280 --> 22:10.320
they may not play every game,

22:10.880 --> 22:12.120
they are very critical.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.360
Morning.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.120
-You've recovered.
-Hi, Coach!

22:18.680 --> 22:22.560
They are reference points,
and when they are missing,

22:23.160 --> 22:24.400
it gets tough.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.680
-You're hurting me.
-Stay down.

22:28.240 --> 22:33.080
Age catches up to everyone.
Not just to those who have already quit.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.240
But they are still focused

22:35.320 --> 22:37.880
on the present, which is
playing for Juventus,

22:37.960 --> 22:39.280
and giving it their best.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.840
Come on, guys.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.960
I can't see you like this.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.000
Let's get up.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.440
While he is busy recovering from injury,

22:53.720 --> 22:56.160
the captain can enjoy some time at home.

23:01.400 --> 23:04.480
I am a great lover of red and Tuscan red.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.920
I have a drink at dinner with my wife.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.520
Not alone, though.

23:09.760 --> 23:13.560
Occasionally even alone,
during lockdown. Occasionally alone.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.480
Tonight he invited Claudio,

23:19.040 --> 23:20.520
his twin brother, to dinner.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.520
-Lore?
-He's fine.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.400
I caught him at practice.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.000
He did the Chiellini slides.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.240
"I did the slides like Chiellini."
Like your uncle, you mean.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.920
My nephew Lorenzo,

23:34.040 --> 23:36.320
in normal conversations, calls me Uncle.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.240
When we talk
about soccer, I become Chiellini.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.720
Claudio is a manager at Juventus

23:43.920 --> 23:46.520
who deals with loans and transfers.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.800
The two have always been very close.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.000
Especially when we were

23:52.680 --> 23:55.640
10, 14, we were uncontrollable whirlwinds.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.000
We went to school and soccer together.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.240
In the evenings, let me tell you...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.080
The beatings we gave each other.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.080
Wrestling.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.840
One time, we were playing ping pong…

24:11.520 --> 24:13.200
The paddle flew off.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.240
I threw his paddle towards the table,

24:16.560 --> 24:18.800
then it bounced and flew by his face.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.200
Believe me, here.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.840
He didn't say anything.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.160
-He went up the stairs...
-"Sorry, sorry."

24:26.360 --> 24:27.840
I locked myself in my room,

24:27.920 --> 24:30.840
and he was like:
"Open, I won't do anything to you."

24:30.920 --> 24:32.480
"No, I don't believe you."

24:32.800 --> 24:35.240
Then we played together until we were 15.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.320
We made it up to the Livorno under-15s,

24:38.400 --> 24:39.600
-so 14.
-14.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.440
One was better than the other...

24:41.520 --> 24:44.440
One was better at certain things,

24:44.640 --> 24:46.080
maybe worse at others.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.760
It was more a matter

24:48.240 --> 24:52.560
of a will to change,
to improve and to train.

24:52.840 --> 24:57.360
A will that I didn't have at 14,
15 years old, and that he did have.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.000
And that
carried him forward in his career.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.520
Surely,

25:02.840 --> 25:04.200
when Giorgio retires,

25:04.560 --> 25:07.080
I won't experience it
as a brother anymore,

25:07.600 --> 25:10.440
and so I'll see the same game
in a different way.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.440
During the games, now,

25:12.720 --> 25:15.640
I really get too nervous.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.520
In my opinion I will experience the games
more calmly.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.480
I'll be sorry, sure.
Your life changes a bit.

25:25.680 --> 25:30.160
I'll have to find a balance.
It's going to be bumpy,

25:30.840 --> 25:34.680
but it doesn't scare me. On the contrary,
the only thing I like,

25:35.200 --> 25:37.840
is that I'll be able
to decide it and live it

25:38.720 --> 25:39.640
in peace.

25:40.200 --> 25:44.000
That is, if it's going to be this July,
the next, or…

25:44.560 --> 25:47.320
like Buffon at 50, we'll see.

25:51.680 --> 25:56.120
I'll tell you the truth.
I'm not afraid of Porto's mental approach.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.560
It's important to have
as many players as possible recover.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.320
With everyone, we win easily.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.040
We have everything we need.
Let's hope for the best.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.600
Four.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Five.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.200
Two rounds of ten.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.280
Push it a bit.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.840
For the past three weeks,
Chiellini and Bonucci

26:26.920 --> 26:30.480
have struggled to get back into shape
in time for the return leg.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.640
The match is just a few days away.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.080
Bonucci's fate depends
on the opinion of the doctors.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.960
Is this the sexy episode
of All or Nothing?

26:47.520 --> 26:50.000
Come. Let's do the MRI
and see how it goes.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.760
Taking bets.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.600
Bye! See you in 20 minutes.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.680
Where's the entrance?

27:03.840 --> 27:05.520
For me, being out is like...

27:05.600 --> 27:07.080
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

27:07.160 --> 27:08.320
...getting stabbed.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.160
For these games that I have been out,

27:12.240 --> 27:14.920
I was told, "Just relax,"

27:15.840 --> 27:17.280
but I can't do it.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.120
-Imaging-wise, good.
-Good?

27:26.160 --> 27:29.040
Consistent with the time.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.280
Very good.
The edema is almost entirely reduced.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.520
Almost a month after the injury,

27:38.600 --> 27:41.320
Bonucci has the green light
to return to play.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
Giorgio?

27:44.880 --> 27:47.880
Giorgio started moving yesterday.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.720
He still has some discomfort…

27:50.560 --> 27:51.560
while walking.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.200
-Go slow.
-Mother of God.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.680
Although his condition has improved,

28:04.760 --> 28:07.760
it is still early for Chiellini
to return to play.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.160
He will not be able to play
in what could be

28:11.280 --> 28:14.160
his last Champions League game
of the season.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.760
It's frustrating…

28:15.840 --> 28:17.200
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

28:17.280 --> 28:21.440
...to get to such important events,
and not be available

28:21.520 --> 28:26.120
for a few days, because the truth is that
maybe a week is on the line,

28:27.040 --> 28:28.920
which in a lifetime is nothing,

28:29.600 --> 28:32.240
but in a championship is everything.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.040
It's hard to stay out.
It's hard to accept it.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.040
MESAGNE (BR)
9 MARCH 2021

28:44.120 --> 28:46.960
The return match with Porto is near.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.920
Fans are getting prepared.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.600
We have to win.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.920
If we are knocked out,
it would be a failed season.

28:57.240 --> 29:01.320
In Puglia, Roberto and his friends
of the Juventus Fan Club of Mesagne

29:01.680 --> 29:05.040
are ready for one
of the most important games of the year.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.720
We can't fail. It's too important.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.680
The tension grows.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.480
We're pumped up, though.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.320
It is a positive tension.

29:19.360 --> 29:23.960
I particularly care about
this Cristiano Ronaldo figurine,

29:24.040 --> 29:25.840
because my mother gave it to me.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.440
It's a lucky charm for me,

29:29.120 --> 29:31.200
but I don't want to think about it.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.840
Let's see what happens.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.040
Here we go, huh? This is it!

29:39.160 --> 29:41.840
Come on, guys, come on!

29:42.520 --> 29:44.800
Let's go, guys, let's go!

29:44.960 --> 29:46.480
It takes courage, guys!

29:46.560 --> 29:48.440
Courage, confidence and strength!

29:48.520 --> 29:51.920
Because we know that we are better.
That's for sure.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.200
So we're already ahead.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.560
We just need a goal.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.600
Chiellini will sit on the bench again.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.960
The captain's armband goes to Bonucci.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.720
We know what game is ahead of us.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.160
Play smart, but brave.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.520
It has to be our night.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.040
We need to move forward.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
Come on!

30:12.200 --> 30:14.320
Come on, let's enjoy this night.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.560
To enjoy it to the fullest,
we have to give 110%!

30:17.680 --> 30:20.120
It's not enough to give 100%.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.360
It's not enough!

30:21.560 --> 30:25.520
Without anxiety, without fear,
with great courage and determination.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.520
Let's go, guys. Come on!

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Given the 2-1 in the first leg,

30:33.080 --> 30:37.000
a victory of 1-0 would be enough
for Juventus to move forward.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.360
Let's go. Come on.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.640
It begins. Enjoy Juventus-Porto,

30:50.720 --> 30:53.880
the return leg
of the Champions League round of sixteen.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.360
Spread out!

30:57.480 --> 30:59.840
Cuadrado, cross into the middle, Morata!

31:03.240 --> 31:05.680
Marega in the middle, looking for Taremi.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.240
Penalty kick for Porto.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.880
Porto has been awarded a penalty
for a foul in the box.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.120
Porto takes the lead.

31:32.280 --> 31:36.480
Now Juventus
needs two goals to get to overtime.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.280
Juan again, fakes, cross…
ball at the other end for Morata,

31:42.360 --> 31:44.000
Morata stops it. Morata!

31:47.560 --> 31:50.120
We are flopping
in the most important games.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.760
This is not a game you recover from.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.720
At halftime, the tension
in the locker room is very high.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.920
Let's try harder!

32:19.000 --> 32:20.120
What crap!

32:20.400 --> 32:21.840
We didn't play at all!

32:21.920 --> 32:23.640
-Let's recover.
-Nothing!

32:23.840 --> 32:25.560
-Calm down.
-Crap!

32:25.840 --> 32:27.280
We played like crap!

32:27.600 --> 32:29.000
Me too! Me too!

32:29.080 --> 32:32.240
You need to be an example to everyone!

32:32.680 --> 32:34.480
That includes me too!

32:34.560 --> 32:37.240
We're not playing at all, let's be honest!

32:37.720 --> 32:40.440
This is a Champions game!

32:41.440 --> 32:43.200
We need to have character!

32:43.280 --> 32:46.320
Enough, come on!
Enough, Cri. Enough, Juan.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.760
Moments like these
in a locker room are commonplace,

32:50.880 --> 32:52.720
when the stakes are this high.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.800
We have to be calm and patient.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.600
Let's continue with spirit,
without fighting, with the composure

32:59.680 --> 33:02.160
of the strong, who want to win.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.920
After the face-off,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.200
calm returns to the locker room.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.520
It takes character
to turn these games around,

33:12.200 --> 33:14.680
and we can only do it together.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.040
As a team, helping each other.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.600
We won't go anywhere on our own.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.800
It only takes two minutes
to score two goals.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.720
Come on!

33:26.040 --> 33:27.440
Let's commit!

33:32.920 --> 33:34.960
With only 45 minutes to go,

33:35.120 --> 33:36.720
Juventus must score two goals

33:36.800 --> 33:39.200
to keep
the dream of the Champions League alive.

33:43.240 --> 33:44.720
Calm! Play it!

33:47.280 --> 33:48.200
Well done!

33:48.680 --> 33:49.840
Federico Chiesa.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.040
Bonucci.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.720
Chiesa!

33:57.240 --> 33:58.480
1-1!

34:03.760 --> 34:07.400
-Come on!
-Go!

34:07.800 --> 34:08.920
Federico Chiesa!

34:11.480 --> 34:14.320
Chiesa's goal brings Juventus
back in the race,

34:15.360 --> 34:17.400
but they need one more to tie.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.360
The game's odds

34:32.440 --> 34:34.160
change in Juventus' favor,

34:34.880 --> 34:38.000
when Porto's forward Taremi is expelled.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.760
With still 35 minutes to play,

34:42.840 --> 34:44.800
Juventus has an extra man.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.440
Rabiot, wide ball
looking for Federico Chiesa.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.320
No!

35:05.080 --> 35:06.600
Chiesa!

35:08.360 --> 35:09.960
We're tied!

35:13.640 --> 35:15.440
Go, Chiesa!

35:16.520 --> 35:20.480
Come on, let's do McKennie and Matthijs.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.320
Matthijs, okay?

35:23.400 --> 35:24.960
With 15 minutes to go,

35:25.200 --> 35:27.440
Pirlo decides to use the young players.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.760
Called back to the bench
is Bonucci himself,

35:33.400 --> 35:35.320
who leaves his place to de Ligt.

35:37.840 --> 35:38.760
Way to go, Leo.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.840
It's hard to be an example all the time.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.520
It takes a mental strength
beyond all logic.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.000
For me being out is like

35:57.160 --> 35:59.840
taking away a child's candy.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.960
Cuadrado, cross looking for Ronaldo!

36:05.120 --> 36:06.920
Ball is barely out.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.160
Ronaldo is unlucky tonight.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.400
Shots, things, rebounds.

36:21.880 --> 36:26.120
Cuadrado, watch out.
Cuadrado, left! Cross!

36:26.520 --> 36:28.480
Sensational cross by Juan Cuadrado

36:28.560 --> 36:30.600
at the 93rd minute!

36:30.760 --> 36:32.880
Why are you cursed? Why?

36:37.000 --> 36:40.640
The score is tied
and the game extends into overtime.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.280
-Everyone to Chiesa.
-Go, Federico, go.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.560
Easy does it.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.960
Spin. Spin without forcing it.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.480
We have half an hour.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.040
Come on. Convincing like we want you.
Come on.

36:59.440 --> 37:03.360
With one extra man and 30 minutes to play,

37:03.560 --> 37:05.920
Juventus is now the favorite.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.400
Shoot it, Kulu!

37:11.640 --> 37:13.320
Idiotic stop.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.680
Foul by Rabiot.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.480
Penalty kick.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.320
Berna!

37:34.360 --> 37:36.080
Porto's tie.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.920
Juventus 2, Porto 2.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.640
This is now Ronaldo's last year.
He's leaving.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.400
Juventus must now score
two goals in five minutes,

37:47.480 --> 37:50.280
or they will be out
of the Champions League.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.840
Bernardeschi, headshot by Rabiot!

37:57.640 --> 37:59.160
A very important goal!

37:59.480 --> 38:00.320
Go!

38:00.600 --> 38:02.960
Juventus 3, Porto 2.

38:06.920 --> 38:07.920
Leave it!

38:08.840 --> 38:10.160
Go!

38:17.000 --> 38:20.640
When we go in,
it's always with a bad temper.

38:31.320 --> 38:36.040
I shared so much with him.
So many good times and some not so good.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.400
Only a miracle can change
the fate of the game.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.600
Go, Berna!

38:56.440 --> 38:57.360
Fuck!

39:03.920 --> 39:07.160
Juventus is eliminated
from the UEFA Champions League.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.200
I don't think anyone in the world

40:07.360 --> 40:09.400
demands so much of himself as he does.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Imagine

40:16.440 --> 40:18.160
the pressure he experiences

40:18.400 --> 40:19.640
every day.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.200
In soccer and sport you can't always win.

40:35.840 --> 40:40.320
So you are left with the bitterness
of having thrown an opportunity away.

40:44.960 --> 40:48.280
It's hard for those like us, who care
about Juventus.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.520
Seeing the team lose hurts even more.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.440
These are scars that will remain
inside us for a lifetime.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.600
Maybe we all had to dig deeper

41:07.160 --> 41:08.360
for competitive anger.

41:11.640 --> 41:16.000
Maybe we took it for granted,
that winning would be easy,

41:16.640 --> 41:18.920
but we saw that it's never easy.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.600
We realized how important it is
to win the game!

41:33.920 --> 41:36.520
We need to find the win. It's important.

41:39.760 --> 41:43.640
The way it's going is hard.
Let's keep going for another 45 minutes.
