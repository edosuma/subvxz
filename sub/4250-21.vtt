12:18.696 --> 12:18.821
UGH.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.663
YOU MUST GO TO ANUBIS HOUSE.

12:27.746 --> 12:31.250
THERE IS A BOOK I NEED
CONTAINING INCANTATIONS.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.712
BRING IT TO ME.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.507
- WILLOW, IS THERE SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

12:38.591 --> 12:41.385
WITH JEROME THAT SEEMS...
ODD?

12:41.469 --> 12:43.429
- OF COURSE.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.725
ME.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.186
- SO...

12:50.269 --> 12:51.812
WHAT ARE YOU LOVELY LADIES
TALKING ABOUT?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.064
- TALKING ABOUT YOU,
ACTUALLY.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.693
- I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK WILLOW
IF SHE TRUSTED YOU.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.111
- AH.

12:59.195 --> 13:03.032
- AND IF SHE HAD, I WOULD
HAVE SAID, "OF COURSE I DO."

13:03.115 --> 13:06.744
MY MR. MOP IS A REAL SOFTIE
ON THE INSIDE

13:06.827 --> 13:10.748
UNDERNEATH THAT TOUGH EXTERIOR
OF BUSHY HAIR.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.458
- KILL ME.
KILL ME NOW.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.714
- ARE YOU GONNA TELL THEM,
HMM?

13:18.797 --> 13:21.425
I PROMISE I'LL TELL THEM.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.303
I JUST WANT TO DO IT RIGHT,
KINDLY.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.679
WAIT FOR THE MOMENT.

13:25.763 --> 13:30.392
- OH, SO MARA SEEING THE PICTURE
THAT WILLOW PUT OF YOU TWO

13:30.476 --> 13:32.645
UP IN THE GIRLS' TOILET
IS NOT THE RIGHT MOMENT?

13:32.728 --> 13:35.397
- WHAT?

13:35.481 --> 13:39.151
- YOU ASKED FOR IT,
SLIMEBALL.

13:39.235 --> 13:44.907
MARA, WILLOW, WOULD YOU COME
HERE FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.159
- ISN'T THAT JEROME'S LAPTOP?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.495
- YEAH, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED
TO SHOW YOU.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.496
- IS IT A SURPRISE?

13:50.579 --> 13:51.997
OH, WE LOVE SURPRISES.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.917
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS ONE.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.960
- OH.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.380
- JEROME'S BEEN CHEATING
ON YOU...

14:02.716 --> 14:04.802
BOTH OF YOU.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.391
- OH.

14:12.268 --> 14:17.106
GIRLS, I'M COMING IN.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.153
[whispers]

14:23.237 --> 14:25.823
LAPTOP.

14:25.906 --> 14:29.076
LAPTOP, LAPTOP, LAPTOP, LAPTOP,
LAPTOP, LAPTOP.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.582
- HEY, JEROMEO.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.583
WHERE'D YOU GO?

14:35.666 --> 14:37.459
[bell ringing]

14:37.543 --> 14:39.461
- NOWHERE...

14:39.545 --> 14:42.006
NOWHERE AT ALL.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.558
- ALL RIGHT, SETTLE DOWN,
EVERYONE, PLEASE.

14:52.641 --> 14:56.312
AS YOU KNOW,
MISS DENBY IS NO LONGER HERE,

14:56.395 --> 15:00.482
SO I WILL BE COVERING
YOUR HISTORY CLASS TOO.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.650
POP QUIZ.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.527
- SHOULDN'T WE WAIT
FOR THE OTHERS, SIR?

15:03.611 --> 15:06.280
- RATHER A LONG WAIT.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.240
YOUR CLASSMATES
WILL NOT BE RETURNING.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.825
- WHY?

15:09.908 --> 15:13.412
- THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED
FROM THE SCHOOL.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.079
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.456
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:15.539 --> 15:17.541
- EXPELLED, MARA.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.168
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.837
- SIR.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.840
- I CAN'T BELIEVE SWEET
EXPELLED US.

15:24.923 --> 15:26.467
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUR DAD
WOULD PRETEND

15:26.550 --> 15:27.718
LIKE THE CEREMONY
NEVER HAPPENED.

15:27.801 --> 15:31.180
- ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE
OF HOW LITTLE I REALLY KNOW HIM.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.598
- WE COULD REPORT THEM.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.515
- AND WHO'S GONNA BELIEVE US?

15:33.599 --> 15:34.516
IT'S OUR WORD AGAINST THEIRS,

15:34.600 --> 15:36.852
AND OUR WORD SOUNDS
PRETTY CRAZY.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.520
- THAT'S IT.
THIS IS THE END.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.231
- NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.483
- NO WAY.
- YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.484
NONE OF YOU ARE.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.569
- THIS STINKS.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.279
- WE STARTED A PETITION.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.489
- IF YOU GO,
WE ALL GO.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.658
- A PETITION'S NOT ENOUGH.
WE NEED ACTION.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.702
WHO'S WITH ME?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.079
- WHAT DO WE WANT?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.038
all: JUSTICE.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.206
- WHEN DO WE WANT IT?

15:57.289 --> 15:58.207
all: NOW.

15:58.290 --> 15:58.749
- WHAT DO WE WANT?

15:58.832 --> 16:00.668
all: JUSTICE.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.002
- ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS GOING TO WORK?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.879
- LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO STICK
TOGETHER, REMEMBER.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.590
IT'S ALL ABOUT LOYALTY.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.009
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.219
- THERE'S A PROTEST.
JOIN US.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.388
- GET OUT OF MY WAY.
- NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.225
WE'RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL
MR. SWEET REVOKES HIS DECISION.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.893
- WHICH IS WHAT, EXACTLY?

16:17.976 --> 16:19.687
- FABIAN, EDDIE, ALFIE,
PATRICIA,

16:19.770 --> 16:21.397
AND KT HAVE BEEN EXPELLED.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.564
WE DEMAND TO KNOW WHY.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.359
WE'LL TAKE IT TO THE TOP
IF WE HAVE TO.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.696
- THE QUEEN.
- NO, WILLOW, THE GOVERNORS.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.322
- ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN.

16:30.406 --> 16:30.989
- I SEE.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.742
- SAVE THE ANUBIS FIVE.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.704
all: SAVE THE ANUBIS FIVE.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.289
- HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY MAD?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.541
- I BEG YOUR PARDON.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.834
- I CAME BACK TO INFORM YOU
THAT I WILL STAY

16:41.917 --> 16:43.711
FOR THE REST OF MY
CONTRACTED TERM,

16:43.794 --> 16:47.047
AND I'M MET WITH A RIOT.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.257
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

16:48.340 --> 16:51.635
- OH, BE QUIET.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.387
- MISS DENBY, YOU LEFT
THIS OFFICE ASKING FOR ACTION

16:53.470 --> 16:55.597
TO BE TAKEN.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.890
I HAVE TAKEN IT.

16:56.974 --> 17:00.227
- AND EXPELLED THE STUDENTS
WHO KNOW OUR SECRETS.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.979
NOW THEY HAVE NOTHING MORE
TO LOSE,

17:02.062 --> 17:03.313
AND THEY'RE ANGRY.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.940
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'LL DO?

17:05.022 --> 17:06.275
- THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.069
- EVIDENCE OR NOT,
TALES OF RITUALS AND KIDNAP

17:09.153 --> 17:11.195
WILL HARDLY IMPRESS THE BOARD,
WILL THEY?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.239
CAN I SUGGEST YOU SORT THIS OUT

17:12.321 --> 17:17.703
AND THEN TRY AND REMAIN
INCONSPICUOUS?

17:17.786 --> 17:19.496
all: SAVE THE ANUBIS FIVE.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.207
- IF WE RELENT,

17:22.290 --> 17:24.917
WE SHALL LOSE THE RESPECT
OF THE STUDENTS FOREVER.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.713
- VICTOR,
THEY DON'T RESPECT US ANYWAY.

17:27.796 --> 17:28.714
I THINK HARRIET'S RIGHT.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.257
IT IS TOO GREAT A RISK.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.182
- BYE.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.225
- IT'S FINE.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.144
- WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THIS GO.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.188
SOMETHING IS GOING ON,
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.482
I THINK IT'S GOT SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THIS ECLIPSE PROJECT.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.443
- OH, JOY, PLEASE,
JUST DROP IT.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.611
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF, OKAY?

17:50.694 --> 17:52.780
- STOP IT.

17:52.863 --> 17:53.947
- YOU PROMISE YOU'LL STAY
IN TOUCH?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.073
- STOP IT.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.325
THIS IS TEMPORARY.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.702
ONCE WE GO TO THE GOVERNORS,
YOU'LL BE BACK.

17:58.786 --> 17:59.787
YOU WILL.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.788
- HEY.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.290
HEY, COME ON.
KEEP YOUR CHIN UP.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.673
- I GUESS YOU GET YOUR WISH,
YACKER.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.674
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO SEE ME
AGAIN.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.011
- I GUESS I DID.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.180
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
MAYBE WE COULD JUST

18:18.263 --> 18:20.682
SKIP THE GOVERNORS
AND GO STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.809
- WILLOW...

18:21.892 --> 18:25.020
- THE TAXIS ARE HERE.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.605
- WE WON'T GIVE UP, GUYS.
I PROMISE.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.356
- OH, COME HERE, LOVES.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.442
COME ON.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.155
- DAD DIDN'T EVEN COME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.838
- MR. SWEET HAS ASKED ME

18:50.921 --> 18:52.589
TO INFORM YOU

18:52.673 --> 18:55.717
THAT YOUR...

18:55.801 --> 18:57.886
EXPULSION HAS BEEN LIFTED.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.888
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.640
- YOU MAY ALL STAY
IN ANUBIS HOUSE.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.935
- WE DID IT.
WE WON.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.311
[all cheering]

19:12.651 --> 19:16.363
[owl hooting]

19:16.446 --> 19:19.116
- YOU SEE, ALFIE GOT SCARED,

19:19.199 --> 19:22.286
AND HE THOUGHT WE WERE FORMING
A REAL CEREMONY.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.537
[laughter]

19:23.620 --> 19:24.037
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.873
- STUPID.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.708
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
I BLAME THE ECLIPSE.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.293
- AND HE SCARED ME,
AND BEFORE WE KNEW IT,

19:29.376 --> 19:32.129
THE CLOCK WAS A PERSON,
DENBY WAS A FAKE,

19:32.212 --> 19:34.089
AND WE WERE CONJURING UP EVIL.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.383
I MEAN,
IT IS RIDICULOUS.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.887
- SO THIS ECLIPSE CEREMONY
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT

19:39.970 --> 19:42.598
THAT THEY WANTED TO GET RID
OF YOU?

19:42.681 --> 19:44.266
all: MM-MM. NO.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.310
- AND THAT'S THE STORY
YOU'RE STICKING TO?

19:46.393 --> 19:47.436
all: YES. MM.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.854
- YEAH, RIGHT.

19:58.363 --> 19:58.697
- DO YOU HATE ME?

19:58.780 --> 20:01.199
- NO.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.995
LOOK, I'D HATE MYSELF IF WE JUST
LET JEROME GET AWAY WITH THIS.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.456
- MM-HMM,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

20:09.833 --> 20:12.211
- WE PLAY JEROME
AT HIS OWN GAME.

20:14.588 --> 20:18.133
- SO WHY DO YOU GUYS THINK
THEY CHANGED THEIR MIND?

20:18.216 --> 20:20.719
- WELL, THE SAME REASON
DENBY SUDDENLY DECIDED

20:20.802 --> 20:22.346
TO STAY AT THE SCHOOL:
FROBISHER.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.307
- OKAY, CAN WE PLEASE HAVE
ONE MOMENT OF JOY

20:25.390 --> 20:26.808
BEFORE WE JUMP
STRAIGHT BACK INTO

20:26.892 --> 20:27.935
THE WHOLE "FIGHTING EVIL" THING?

20:28.018 --> 20:29.645
I GET TO AVOID DEATH BY PARENT.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.021
GIVE ME A MOMENT
TO EMBRACE THAT.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.148
- YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.566
GONNA GO UNPACK.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.835
[clock chiming]

20:53.919 --> 20:58.340
- IT IS 10:00.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.388
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES PRECISELY.

21:05.180 --> 21:11.019
THEN I WANT TO HEAR A PIN...

21:14.189 --> 21:15.232
DROP.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.782
- [exhales]

21:23.865 --> 21:26.201
[inhales]

21:26.284 --> 21:27.869
RULER OF THE UNDERWORLD,

21:27.953 --> 21:32.165
I HAVE ARISEN,

21:32.249 --> 21:37.713
YOUR SERVANT,
TO DO YOUR BIDDING,

21:37.796 --> 21:39.715
TO DESTROY
THOSE WHO TRY TO STOP YOU

21:39.798 --> 21:44.386
AND YOUR ABOMINABLE REIGN.

21:44.469 --> 21:48.598
ARISE,
GREAT DEVOURER OF SOULS.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.101
HIDE NO LONGER.

21:51.184 --> 21:54.271
IN DARKNESS,
WE ARE UNITED.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.772
[thunder booming]

21:55.856 --> 21:59.526
IN DARKNESS,
WE SHALL RULE.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.905
ARISE!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.824
ARISE!

22:05.907 --> 22:10.662
ARISE AND RULE!

22:10.746 --> 22:11.913
- NO!
