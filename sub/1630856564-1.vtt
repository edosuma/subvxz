but given you're in his house,

don't you?

One of them is a white guy,
and he's a really good dancer.

-No, not Kevin Bacon.

-I have no idea.
-Yeah, no clue.

-Fuck, X.
-Hold on. Give me a minute,
I'm trying to think.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.638
Why did you tell me
to move away from the door?

21:38.676 --> 21:42.162
Oh, yes.
Basically, right, in the movie,
there's these three guys,

21:42.301 --> 21:44.510
and they bust in
and shoot the three guys

21:44.682 --> 21:46.857
and there's like
another guy who comes
out of the bathroom

21:46.995 --> 21:48.445
and he shoots
and he doesn't hit.

21:48.652 --> 21:50.861
But, I mean,
that's a movie, so...

21:50.999 --> 21:53.657
So if there was a fourth guy,

21:53.760 --> 21:56.384
it's likely that
he would actually kill us.

21:56.522 --> 21:58.869

Where's the fourth guy?

21:58.972 --> 22:02.942

so messy, I had to change it.

01:25:34.474 --> 01:25:37.960
I prefer this one.
Brings out the red.

01:25:45.209 --> 01:25:46.141
Jonas.

01:25:47.003 --> 01:25:47.866
Yes.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:50.973
How did the job go?

01:25:51.974 --> 01:25:54.563
Yeah, it went... well.

01:25:55.011 --> 01:25:56.875
Wonderful, wonderful.

01:25:57.013 --> 01:26:00.534
So what did you do
with the body?

01:26:00.672 --> 01:26:01.846
I, er...

01:26:03.123 --> 01:26:06.091
I dropped it.
In the river.

01:26:06.505 --> 01:26:11.752
Well,
not the cleanest of methods,
but everyone has their style.

01:26:11.856 --> 01:26:14.169
Have you always done this?

01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:15.480
JONAS: Yes.

01:26:16.826 --> 01:26:19.001
BANKSBI:
Have you ever missed one?

01:26:19.139 --> 01:26:20.657
[Suspenseful music continues]

01:26:20.796 --> 01:26:21.900
JONAS: I'm sorry?

01:26:22.418 --> 01:26:24.351
Well.
[Breathes rapidly]

01:26:25.663 --> 01:26:28.355
You drop them in the river,
they're not dead.

01:26:28.493 --> 01:26:31.427
They swim out of the river,
they're still alive.

01:26:31.565 --> 01:26:34.534
You know, that sort of thing.

01:26:35.431 --> 01:26:37.398
Er...

01:26:37.537 --> 01:26:38.745
No.

01:26:39.124 --> 01:26:40.954
Oh, good. Excellent, Jonas.

01:26:41.092 --> 01:26:45.200
So you're not an idiot.
Good to know.

01:26:46.684 --> 01:26:48.168
Are you done?

01:26:48.962 --> 01:26:50.377
Yes.

01:26:50.826 --> 01:26:53.173
Wonderful.
On your knees, please, Jonas.

01:26:55.139 --> 01:26:56.383
What?

01:26:56.521 --> 01:26:58.903
BANKSBI:
On your knees, Jonas.

01:27:00.698 --> 01:27:03.528
She won't help you, darling.
She's not here for you.

01:27:03.632 --> 01:27:05.841
On your knees, please.

01:27:07.877 --> 01:27:10.570
Please. Please,
I didn't do anything.

01:27:10.915 --> 01:27:15.126
Oh, don't sell yourself short.
You did more than enough.

01:27:15.264 --> 01:27:18.094
On your knees.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:20.304
I won't ask again.

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:26.585
Don't be silly, in the middle!

01:27:44.568 --> 01:27:48.710
What type of a business
do I run, Jonas?

01:27:51.473 --> 01:27:53.198
I don't know, drugs?

01:27:53.337 --> 01:27:55.339
You never told me.

01:27:55.822 --> 01:27:58.618
Yes, that's right, I never did.

01:27:58.721 --> 01:28:02.967
But I'm going to tell
you now, just once.

01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:05.175
Because I like you.

01:28:05.314 --> 01:28:09.422
I run a successful business.

01:28:09.939 --> 01:28:13.115
What we sell or don't sell
is completely irrelevant.

01:28:13.253 --> 01:28:18.293
The key point is that
the operation is successful.

01:28:18.914 --> 01:28:20.571
Do you agree?

01:28:21.813 --> 01:28:26.818
What do you think it takes
to run a successful business
like mine, Jonas?

01:28:29.545 --> 01:28:31.996
I don't know.
Money?

01:28:33.342 --> 01:28:35.724
Well, more or less.

01:28:36.068 --> 01:28:39.831
Not really, we make money,
we need money to run.

01:28:39.934 --> 01:28:45.871
But what makes us
a successful business
is our workers.

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:48.219
Everybody has a function.

01:28:48.357 --> 01:28:52.396
It's like
a beautiful Swiss watch.

01:28:52.499 --> 01:28:56.400
All the little pieces inside
make it run perfectly.

01:28:56.503 --> 01:28:59.505
But if one little gear breaks,

01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:03.338
the whole thing just stops.

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:09.378
And every single one of us
has to do our job perfectly.

01:29:09.516 --> 01:29:12.898
So that my machine works.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:19.594
You kill people who would
threaten the correct running
of my machine.

01:29:19.768 --> 01:29:22.805
You are a very
important piece, Jonas.

01:29:22.943 --> 01:29:27.431
But being a very important piece
means you are responsible

01:29:27.534 --> 01:29:33.091
for the livelihoods
of hundreds
of hardworking people.

01:29:34.334 --> 01:29:36.992
We are a family, Jonas.

01:29:37.233 --> 01:29:42.066
And I can't allow you
to put my family at risk.

01:29:42.237 --> 01:29:44.482
I really can't.

01:29:45.932 --> 01:29:48.900
Please. Please, I'm sorry.

01:29:49.175 --> 01:29:50.902
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

01:29:51.075 --> 01:29:53.077
Whatever you did?

01:29:53.215 --> 01:29:56.080
You do not even know
what you did wrong.

01:29:57.495 --> 01:29:59.877
[Suspenseful music continues]

01:30:01.913 --> 01:30:04.744
Remember five years ago,

01:30:04.847 --> 01:30:08.955
I asked you to get rid
of a problem for me?

01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:16.376
Come on, think hard.
I know you can do it.

01:30:16.549 --> 01:30:18.620
You're not an idiot, are you?

01:30:20.794 --> 01:30:21.864
Ahh...

01:30:22.831 --> 01:30:25.212
there we are.

01:30:25.592 --> 01:30:31.287
See, a little birdie told me
that they saw him the other day.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.773
Maybe you dropped him
in the river.

01:30:34.636 --> 01:30:37.121
And he was still alive.

01:30:37.293 --> 01:30:40.089
But you said
that never happened.

01:30:40.365 --> 01:30:43.782
So the only conclusion
I can come to

01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:45.198
is that you

01:30:45.509 --> 01:30:47.889
betrayed me.

01:30:49.029 --> 01:30:50.790
Wouldn't you agree?

01:30:55.553 --> 01:30:57.072
Please...

01:30:57.244 --> 01:30:59.557
I'll do anything you want.

01:30:59.764 --> 01:31:02.180
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:31:03.975 --> 01:31:06.081
It won't happen again.

01:31:07.289 --> 01:31:08.463
Please.

01:31:08.635 --> 01:31:10.775
[Whimpers]

01:31:10.913 --> 01:31:12.639
I'll do anything you want.

01:31:12.777 --> 01:31:15.331
Please, please, please.

01:31:17.333 --> 01:31:18.990
[Sobs]

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.236
Forgive me.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.999
That won't be necessary.

BANKSBI: Lucy, dear,

01:31:42.151 --> 01:31:44.568
could you get Mark in here?

01:31:44.671 --> 01:31:46.327
Thank you.

01:31:47.778 --> 01:31:50.643
-Tea?
-Would you excuse me
for a moment?

01:31:50.781 --> 01:31:53.162
Of course, of course.
Come back when you're done.

01:31:53.335 --> 01:31:54.509
Sure.

No. Yeah, no, of course. Sorry.

I'm here to deliver
a message to the Silver Dragon.

You want to come in?

01:33:02.266 --> 01:33:03.888
Nah, that's cool.

to kill me once.

-What?
-Long story.

01:33:05.889 --> 01:33:07.719

01:33:07.858 --> 01:33:10.412
to meet us at the abandoned

the kid again.
