We have a toasted mouse
that didn't get the T4

00:02.386 --> 00:03.711
and a happy mouse that did!

00:03.828 --> 00:06.342
It either works or not.
Wanna watch Bob burst into flames?

00:07.709 --> 00:09.352
Get back to work!

00:09.481 --> 00:12.927
- He's such an asshole, Carlos.
- He's scared, Mayko.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.505
David!

00:14.627 --> 00:17.509
You're not sick because of
the cyanobacteria.

00:18.044 --> 00:19.933
When you came in you were legally drunk.

00:20.013 --> 00:22.433
They found Sertraline and
Escitalopram in your system.

00:22.513 --> 00:23.858
Just take me home.

00:23.943 --> 00:27.248
Why won't you just say "goodbye dad"?

00:27.706 --> 00:29.831
Why do you make it so hard
for me to leave?

00:32.670 --> 00:34.424
Dad. Dad!

00:35.466 --> 00:38.432
Go in there and let
them tell <i>you</i> what to do.

00:39.775 --> 00:43.283
I come out of there, I become this total
boring prick, you'll tell me right?

00:43.696 --> 00:45.429
It's too late for that.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.645
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:08.664 --> 01:09.673
Very nice.

01:18.292 --> 01:20.207
Good morning. Good morning.

01:34.597 --> 01:36.625
Shit, shit!

01:58.871 --> 02:00.712
What do you make of this?

02:02.496 --> 02:04.740
They think it's West Nile Virus.

02:05.801 --> 02:08.695
It's tough to diagnose,
even tougher to cure.

02:09.110 --> 02:11.340
It's very routine these days.
Why are they bothering us?

02:11.502 --> 02:13.140
Just keep reading.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.107
Victims, male, females, 30s and 40s.

02:17.177 --> 02:19.827
Most people who get sick
with West Nile are over 50.

02:20.024 --> 02:21.555
There are exceptions.

02:21.733 --> 02:24.297
I've heard of 35-year olds
who come down with it.

02:25.996 --> 02:29.786
I was hoping we could divert this crate
to San Francisco. Avoid this bullshit.

02:34.927 --> 02:37.706
- What's this?
- A wish list.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.223
That's what you do all day.

02:43.957 --> 02:46.239
You're asking for 147 million?

02:46.351 --> 02:49.275
- Yeah.
- 2 million for an electron microscope.

02:49.392 --> 02:51.411
Are you sleeping with somebody
I don't know about?

02:51.491 --> 02:53.436
I ran it all past Herb Kinsman
when you were out.

02:53.516 --> 02:54.828
Didn't even blink.

02:54.950 --> 02:57.069
Then why is he pulling
us down to Washington?

02:57.149 --> 03:00.223
Because the White House has put
together this blue ribbon advisory board

03:00.303 --> 03:01.949
and he would like to showcase us.

03:02.089 --> 03:06.877
So I would like <i>you</i>
to focus on being a nice, genial guy.

03:08.896 --> 03:10.479
I am so good at that.

03:10.601 --> 03:13.603
Answer some basic questions like
"What have you done for us lately?"

03:13.683 --> 03:15.943
I think Utah would be
a good talking point.

03:16.141 --> 03:17.726
If I'm still awake.

03:17.820 --> 03:20.327
Would you like
147 million dollars or not?

03:23.440 --> 03:25.459
Wake me when I'm on.

Oh Lord, okay.

05:16.601 --> 05:18.195
- The first stop?
- Where do we hide?

05:18.275 --> 05:19.266
Bar.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.893
- We've never met. I'm Mayko Tran.
- Pleased to meet you.

05:26.581 --> 05:28.994
- Oh my God.
- What?

05:30.156 --> 05:31.820
Be right back.

05:37.766 --> 05:39.719
How are you?

05:39.973 --> 05:42.508
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thank you.

05:43.738 --> 05:45.793
Surprised to see you here.

05:45.957 --> 05:47.819
I'm the new science czar.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.284
- Really?
- Really.

05:52.497 --> 05:53.917
So I would just...

05:54.549 --> 05:56.492
love to hear how you landed that one.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.386
It was an opportunity I couldn't refuse.

05:59.466 --> 06:02.374
- An opportunity to what?
- Don't flatter yourself.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.259
We're in Washington.
It's all about maintaining

06:05.339 --> 06:07.548
the perception
of civility, right?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.415
I had a really nice visit with Jeff.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.663
Did you get that letter
from my lawyer?

06:18.292 --> 06:19.738
I did.

06:21.391 --> 06:23.374
I have to tell you that
I was really hoping that

06:23.468 --> 06:26.670
we could discuss Jeff's
custody without a lawyer.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.271
Can't the 3 of us
sit down and work this out?

06:30.510 --> 06:34.261
Personally, I would
prefer an outside opinion.

06:40.587 --> 06:43.563
- So you never answered my question.
- Which was what?

06:43.648 --> 06:47.351
How did you get this appointment without
knowing one damn thing about science?

06:47.987 --> 06:52.216
Well, I slept with you for 25 years.
I suppose something rubbed off.

07:00.182 --> 07:02.470
The optic nerve damage
was extensive.

07:02.550 --> 07:05.391
But the surgical team at Sinai
treated it aggressively.

07:05.471 --> 07:08.830
I was told if the impact had just been
2 millimetres closer to the macula,

07:08.910 --> 07:10.889
I would have been permanently blinded.

07:15.218 --> 07:17.537
So are we having a good time?

07:17.781 --> 07:20.647
It's more fun than
a roadside colonoscopy.

07:22.260 --> 07:24.411
I got another reply from San Francisco.

07:24.889 --> 07:27.709
They think it's 2 outbreaks:
West Nile and something else.

07:31.891 --> 07:34.539
Mr. Riddlemeyer, Weston Field, NorBAC.

07:34.619 --> 07:37.668
Good to see you, Weston. I was
looking over your brief this morning.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.671
- It was thorough, tight. I appreciate.
- Thank you.

07:41.248 --> 07:44.208
I'm a little bit surprised by
all the changes at the top though, sir.

07:45.051 --> 07:46.938
Carl. Hm?

07:47.145 --> 07:50.794
That's how it goes with this
administration. It's results-oriented.

07:51.057 --> 07:52.554
Without the appropriate outcomes,

07:52.655 --> 07:54.492
they're not afraid to act decisively.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.464
Let me introduce you to NorBAC.

07:57.576 --> 08:00.304
It's not necessary.
Carlos Serrano. Carl Riddlemeyer.

08:00.899 --> 08:02.717
<i>Mucho gusto en conocerlo.</i>

08:03.436 --> 08:06.505
<i>Es muy buenas cosas de usted.</i>

08:07.078 --> 08:08.955
<i>Pues se va a desilusionar.</i>

08:09.059 --> 08:10.767
<i>De ninguna manera.</i>

08:12.151 --> 08:15.140
David Sandström.
Your reputation precedes you.

08:15.541 --> 08:16.543
Who are you?

08:16.623 --> 08:18.629
- This is Carlton Riddlemeyer.
- It's Carl.

08:19.569 --> 08:23.399
- Let's get you a drink.
- No thanks. I'm on the wagon. 3 weeks.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.627
I've been there. Good luck.

08:26.392 --> 08:28.082
So what's the game here, Carl?

08:28.185 --> 08:31.951
It's all about sharpening
the tip of the spear, Dave.

08:32.129 --> 08:33.836
Reevaluate. Rejuvenate.

08:33.921 --> 08:38.361
- Cut the fat, you know. So we...
- It's just...

08:40.916 --> 08:42.952
- What?
- Is this David Sandström?

08:43.065 --> 08:44.959
- Yeah, who's this?
- Angelica Starov.

08:45.039 --> 08:46.767
I'd like to talk to you about Owen.

08:46.870 --> 08:48.894
You know what. Hang on a second.

08:48.974 --> 08:51.448
I gotta take this.
A good friend of mine's in the slammer.

08:51.528 --> 08:53.713
You're a Republican,
I'm sure you understand.

08:58.127 --> 09:00.087
Okay, yeah, what, Owen? Go ahead.

09:00.167 --> 09:03.392
He's been getting in fights.
He stabbed another inmate.

09:03.472 --> 09:04.772
Okay, um...

09:04.852 --> 09:07.021
And I believe he's back on drugs.

09:07.101 --> 09:09.234
Fuck. Look, I wanna
talk to you about this.

09:09.314 --> 09:11.863
I really do but I can't right now.
Can I call you back?

09:11.943 --> 09:13.548
- When?
- Tomorrow.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.534
Tomorrow night... ish.

09:23.423 --> 09:25.798
Maybe I should just go back to Toronto.

09:25.939 --> 09:28.743
So, Rachel,
you're just full of surprises.

09:28.823 --> 09:31.311
- I'm as surprised as anybody.
- Where'd he come from?

09:31.704 --> 09:33.441
Money and power. He's a lobbyist.

09:33.526 --> 09:35.927
He reps everything from
Tobacco to Big Pharma

09:36.007 --> 09:38.079
- anyone who needs a shot of perfume.
- Okay...

09:38.234 --> 09:39.768
Charming, manipulative, brutal.

09:39.848 --> 09:41.363
Usually all 3 at once.

09:41.443 --> 09:43.319
And you're married to him?

09:43.507 --> 09:45.725
- I'm divorcing him.
- Great.

09:45.809 --> 09:48.345
What can we expect from him tomorrow?

09:48.438 --> 09:50.260
We'll be catching a falling knife.

09:56.317 --> 09:59.125
- 2 more hospitalizations.
- In San Francisco?

09:59.641 --> 10:03.069
We could be doing the science
instead of just talking about it.

10:06.705 --> 10:11.278
Last week, the President called me into
the Oval Office and asked me to help.

10:12.010 --> 10:16.426
My first challenge is to cut 3.8 billion
dollars out of the science budget.

10:16.578 --> 10:19.461
No one likes this. He's put me
in a very difficult situation

10:19.541 --> 10:21.829
so I have asked these
distinguished gentlemen

10:21.951 --> 10:24.402
to recommend some major
institutional cuts.

10:24.655 --> 10:28.909
Now, I'm of the opinion that too many
individual cuts weakens the whole.

10:29.068 --> 10:31.704
Sometimes amputation is in order.

10:32.647 --> 10:36.309
I've been advised to take
a good hard look at NorBAC.

10:36.572 --> 10:38.672
- Are you familiar with NorBAC?
- Somewhat.

10:38.752 --> 10:42.848
Enough to see that there are
a number of structural issues.

10:43.027 --> 10:45.121
The lab is abroad, run by a Canadian.

10:45.224 --> 10:47.726
We have to share decisions
with both Mexico and Canada.

10:47.806 --> 10:50.721
Now, I understand that
this is an enormous decision.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.171
And I like to believe that...

10:53.447 --> 10:54.754
I am open to dialogue.

10:55.438 --> 10:59.517
I want to give you people
a chance to state your case.

11:00.644 --> 11:03.855
I assure you, my mind is open.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.802
- Doctor Sandström.
- Would you allow me to begin?

11:11.037 --> 11:14.216
NorBAC is a watchdog
in the world of genetic science.

11:14.335 --> 11:16.942
- But what do you actually do?
- We do what nobody else does.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.792
We're a biomedical SWAT team.

11:18.897 --> 11:22.563
We have expertise in bioweaponry,
disease outbreaks, climate threats...

11:22.643 --> 11:25.220
We've all read the brochure.
Let's talk specifics.

11:28.548 --> 11:30.815
What have you done for me lately?

11:34.175 --> 11:37.321
Oh, I don't know, uh... lately...

11:38.175 --> 11:40.644
We saved the planet's water supply.

11:40.841 --> 11:44.317
And you tested the solution on yourself.

11:44.692 --> 11:47.077
- What if it went wrong?
- It didn't.

11:47.847 --> 11:49.108
It went really well.

11:49.838 --> 11:51.688
The bottom line is,
in the science envelope

11:51.792 --> 11:55.819
I have centres for disease control,
environmental protection, food and drug,

11:56.010 --> 11:59.398
NIH. And then
there is homeland security,

11:59.478 --> 12:03.285
customs and borders,
FBI, CIA, NSA, FEMA.

12:03.501 --> 12:07.342
They all now do science
preparedness and response.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.588
So why the heck do I need NorBAC?

12:09.668 --> 12:13.003
This is by far the finest lab
I've ever been associated with.

12:13.351 --> 12:14.773
As I understand it, Ms. Woods

12:14.889 --> 12:17.248
you've been in academia
for the last 10 years.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.639
We have scientists from 3 countries.

12:20.431 --> 12:22.543
Viruses know no borders, neither do we.

12:22.637 --> 12:24.911
That gives us
a special place in U.S. science.

12:24.991 --> 12:27.166
We pay 80% of the tab.

12:27.278 --> 12:31.231
Why should the American taxpayer
support a lab that's in Toronto, Canada?

12:31.592 --> 12:35.009
And your location allows you
to circumvent american law.

12:35.216 --> 12:38.542
Work was done at NorBAC
to reverse engineer AIDS drugs.

12:38.622 --> 12:40.699
Technically we didn't break any US laws.

12:41.019 --> 12:43.810
What about the fact
that your chief virologist

12:43.890 --> 12:46.871
got sick from a disease
that you were trying to solve?

12:46.951 --> 12:49.262
- That was an accident...
- She quit over it didn't she?

12:49.342 --> 12:51.339
Now what was her name?
Her name was Jill...

12:51.443 --> 12:53.735
Langston.
What the hell is going on here?

12:53.857 --> 12:54.987
Excuse me?

12:55.335 --> 12:58.152
After everything we've done,
everything we've been through,

12:58.415 --> 13:02.336
you dragged our asses down here
because we have some explaining to do?

13:02.649 --> 13:05.128
This isn't personal, Dr. Sandström.

13:05.222 --> 13:07.173
I'm sorry if you have
a problem with procedure.

13:07.396 --> 13:08.398
Well...

13:08.557 --> 13:11.047
I wanna be perfectly clear here, so...

13:11.441 --> 13:13.498
I'll rephrase the question.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.490
You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about...

13:16.592 --> 13:19.110
And your distinguished
advisors clearly don't have

13:19.228 --> 13:21.314
a fucking clue
about what we do at NorBAC.

13:21.519 --> 13:25.409
But we have to sit here pissing in
our pants while you decide our future?

13:25.726 --> 13:29.373
We're simply following a directive
from the President of the United States.

13:29.453 --> 13:31.451
Yeah? Fuck that shit and fuck you.

13:31.531 --> 13:33.733
This is a goddamn ambush.
We're done here.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.728
- Perhaps you'd like to sit down.
- You know...

13:36.268 --> 13:40.383
every day your government spends in Iraq
could fund NorBAC for a decade.

13:40.463 --> 13:42.552
If your President
wants to hack away at his budget,

13:42.632 --> 13:45.804
- tell him to look at the Pentagon.
- The subject is science, not politics.

13:45.884 --> 13:46.702
Science?

13:47.453 --> 13:50.194
Science is on the verge
of unlocking the secrets of life.

13:50.298 --> 13:53.410
There are genetics programs
out there underway right now,

13:53.641 --> 13:56.531
that make the Manhattan Project
look like a bunch of fucking babies

13:56.639 --> 13:57.902
playing with lego blocks,

13:57.982 --> 14:00.656
and you're thinking about
amputating the only organization

14:00.749 --> 14:03.830
that's actually minding
the goddamn store. You're insane!

14:04.253 --> 14:05.821
All of you!

14:08.065 --> 14:09.915
FEMA! Jesus Christ!!!

14:10.093 --> 14:11.822
Thank you, Dr. Sandström.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.719
Thank you for your time.

14:31.935 --> 14:34.827
- Where is he?
- Relax, Wes.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.207
He screwed us in there!

14:36.338 --> 14:39.177
We have operating funds for 4 maybe
5 months then the lab is finished.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.561
What was he supposed to do?
It was an inquisition.

14:41.823 --> 14:43.525
Beautifully orchestrated by Riddlemeyer.

14:45.274 --> 14:46.495
There he is.

14:47.415 --> 14:49.423
Let's get out of here.

14:51.311 --> 14:53.242
- Who in the hell do you think you are?
- What?

14:53.322 --> 14:56.584
You cannot tell the US government
to go fuck themselves!

14:57.983 --> 15:00.443
They let us play in their sandbox;
you went and shit in it.

15:00.593 --> 15:02.609
And I have
all the confidence in the world,

15:02.689 --> 15:05.455
that you'll find how to clean it up.
Right now, we've got work to do.

15:05.535 --> 15:08.691
Carlos and I are going to San Francisco.
They don't know which way is up.

15:08.772 --> 15:11.190
The rest of you back to TO.
They're sending samples.

15:12.689 --> 15:14.323
In or out, Wes?

15:18.933 --> 15:20.018
Shit.

15:37.278 --> 15:40.374
- Doctor Sandström?
- David. This is Carlos Serrano.

15:40.454 --> 15:42.120
- Carlos.
- Nice to meet you.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.476
- Good flight?
- Next time we take donkeys.

15:44.556 --> 15:46.312
Where are we at?

15:46.781 --> 15:50.280
We have 27 critically ill,

15:50.364 --> 15:54.437
4 mortalities, caused by
necrotizing pneumonia.

15:54.981 --> 15:58.221
They are spread out over
7 hospitals in the bay area.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.986
- Victims?
- Adults, equally male and female.

16:02.547 --> 16:04.406
- No recoveries?
- None yet.

16:04.742 --> 16:08.110
- We understand you have some anomalies.
- Why we called you.

16:08.190 --> 16:10.424
Test results are all contradictory.

16:10.654 --> 16:14.535
We have 4 hospitals saying
it's West Nile and 3 saying it isn't.

16:15.032 --> 16:16.365
And that's because...

16:16.596 --> 16:18.893
Well, West Nile is spread by mosquitoes.

16:18.990 --> 16:22.585
Generally, we'd see 30 to 50 mild cases

16:22.682 --> 16:25.334
in an infected area
for each hospitalization.

16:25.496 --> 16:27.793
- You're not finding that here?
- No.

16:28.815 --> 16:29.840
Okay.

16:30.162 --> 16:34.133
So you've got a West Nile-like virus
that's not being spread by mosquitoes.

16:35.059 --> 16:36.207
Human contact.

16:36.307 --> 16:39.655
But none of the victims knew each other.
Other than the 2 couples.

16:39.755 --> 16:40.931
So how is it spreading?

16:45.147 --> 16:47.744
David would like for you
to text him your results.

16:47.849 --> 16:52.846
Tell him the IgM-antibody capture
ELISA test came up positive for WNV.

16:53.349 --> 16:56.499
We're also doing
a real-time PCR on the CSF.

16:56.996 --> 16:59.032
- CSF?
- Cerebrospinal fluid.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.144
- And an IgG ELISA.
- You just said that.

17:02.282 --> 17:05.125
That was an IgM.
But they show a lot of false positives,

17:05.237 --> 17:09.654
so we're doing a couple of extra
serum tests: an IgG and an IgA ELISA.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.393
- How about you do that?
- Yeah.

17:11.609 --> 17:14.179
West Nile 2004 in the bay area.

17:14.893 --> 17:16.137
Lot of dots.

17:18.569 --> 17:19.628
2005.

17:22.112 --> 17:23.184
2006.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.132
West Nile is increasing

17:26.279 --> 17:28.096
20% a year in the Bay Area.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.694
Climate change?

17:30.220 --> 17:31.374
Probably.

17:33.906 --> 17:35.177
Let's take a look.

17:38.726 --> 17:40.421
Fever, headache,

17:41.159 --> 17:43.523
stiff neck, convulsions,

17:44.283 --> 17:46.074
pneumonia, coma.

17:46.455 --> 17:47.903
Textbook West Nile.

17:49.737 --> 17:50.912
Treatment?

17:51.131 --> 17:53.441
Intravenous and pulmonary assist.

17:53.819 --> 17:55.288
What's the CDC saying?

17:55.936 --> 17:58.424
They'll have PRNT results in 4 days.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.642
Are any of these patients
healthy enough to talk?

18:01.941 --> 18:04.647
She's the only one
who's making any sense.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.326
My name is Doctor Carlos Serrano.

18:19.292 --> 18:22.026
Do you remember
being bitten by a mosquito?

18:27.320 --> 18:30.546
Have you travelled or been
on an airplane in the last 10 days?

18:31.929 --> 18:32.940
No.

18:33.769 --> 18:37.323
Have you been with anyone
who's sick in the last 10 days?

18:39.596 --> 18:42.097
I work at the information desk

18:43.188 --> 18:44.446
at a library.

18:46.124 --> 18:47.956
Strangers all day long.

18:48.682 --> 18:51.826
Nina, do you have any idea
how you caught this illness?

18:55.137 --> 18:56.777
God has a plan.

18:58.202 --> 19:01.058
Everything happens for a reason.

19:06.325 --> 19:07.924
Are you a man of faith?

19:09.406 --> 19:10.434
Yes.

19:10.971 --> 19:12.475
People are dying,

19:14.182 --> 19:15.194
aren't they?

19:16.966 --> 19:20.533
Don't worry, Nina. You have
the best care in the world here.

19:24.008 --> 19:25.088
God bless.

19:26.317 --> 19:27.410
God bless.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.023
There you are.

19:51.143 --> 19:53.343
Video hook-up with David
in the conference room.

19:53.428 --> 19:55.382
- Great. Thanks.
- Okay.

19:56.406 --> 19:59.194
Rachel, Wes says
the 2 tests came up contradictory.

19:59.321 --> 20:00.593
That's putting it mildly.

20:00.716 --> 20:04.881
They got the same thing here. The CDC
is doing PRNT, we need to kick some ass.

20:05.111 --> 20:06.581
- I'll run a PCR.
- Good.

20:06.661 --> 20:09.495
Here's the problem with the West Nile
diagnosis. I'm not buying that

20:09.575 --> 20:11.743
all 4 of these people
got bitten by mosquitoes.

20:11.919 --> 20:12.978
It's possible.

20:13.058 --> 20:16.017
No, there'd at least be a mosquito bite,
somewhere it scratch.

20:16.097 --> 20:19.038
Are there no cases of West Nil passing
from human to human?

20:19.256 --> 20:21.204
One case of mother-to-fetus and...

20:21.290 --> 20:23.505
one case of an infant
getting it from breast milk.

20:23.695 --> 20:26.018
There. That's why it's gotta
be another kind of virus.

20:26.101 --> 20:30.200
People don't know each other.
The transmission has to be, food, place,

20:30.317 --> 20:31.651
or air system.

20:32.350 --> 20:35.834
That narrows it down to couple thousand
types of virus or bacteria.

20:35.977 --> 20:38.218
Rachel, you just keep
trying to identify it.

20:38.317 --> 20:40.720
Bob, look for a chemical
or environmental explanation.

20:40.803 --> 20:43.784
Carlos will work the cure. He'll liaise
with the CDC and other hospitals.

20:43.864 --> 20:46.901
- I know that's not a real word, Bob.
- Interface.

20:47.355 --> 20:49.993
Mayko, see if these people are
more connected than we think.

20:50.100 --> 20:53.304
Okay, maybe they all went to the opera,
ate at the same restaurant,

20:53.384 --> 20:55.393
had the same flu shot.
You know the routine.

20:55.540 --> 20:56.989
Happy hunting.

21:37.893 --> 21:40.968
We need full medical records
on several patients...

21:41.136 --> 21:43.323
I've got social security numbers here.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.151
Patient one is Dennis Harper,

21:47.246 --> 21:51.334
social security number 482-623.

21:56.570 --> 21:58.607
That's not what I wanted.

22:18.283 --> 22:19.431
Anything?

22:20.499 --> 22:23.970
Patient 23 has high levels of
nickel, cadmium, and palladium.

22:24.407 --> 22:27.673
- I don't think it's anything, Rachel.
- I think you're right.

22:35.144 --> 22:36.265
What?

22:38.363 --> 22:40.426
Okay... So, of 31 people,

22:41.514 --> 22:46.312
2 went to the same catholic high school
in Cleveland at the same time,

22:47.050 --> 22:48.348
but didn't know each other.

22:49.388 --> 22:52.066
And that's about the most exciting thing
I've found so far. You?

22:52.309 --> 22:53.320
Nothing.

22:53.427 --> 22:56.088
I do have some more PCR data
coming in I could use a hand with.

22:56.168 --> 22:57.381
Yeah, no problem.

22:59.083 --> 23:01.311
- Coffee?
- Yeah, love some.

23:02.051 --> 23:04.169
So can I ask you a personal question?

23:04.962 --> 23:06.042
Let me guess.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.318
You and Carl Riddlemeyer?

23:09.467 --> 23:11.613
I cannot get the 2 of
you together in my head.

23:11.977 --> 23:13.644
I'm sorry, how did that happen?

23:13.853 --> 23:17.789
Well I'm a freshman at Brown.
It's the 70s. And...

23:19.006 --> 23:22.542
I read an op-ed in a student paper:

23:22.784 --> 23:26.235
<i>Fighting for peace?
Fucking for chastity. Get out now.</i>

23:26.720 --> 23:28.489
That's the guy I fell for.

23:29.519 --> 23:32.704
- And that was Carlton?
- Yeah, that's right.

23:32.874 --> 23:35.758
Walked away from a family
fortune to change the world.

23:35.925 --> 23:37.880
- Pretty sexy.
- Serious dough?

23:38.071 --> 23:41.201
Carlton Riddlemeyer the 4th.
Shock and awe...

23:41.490 --> 23:43.266
For all the right reasons.

23:43.564 --> 23:46.558
Okay, so then what happened
to this fairy tale?

23:46.815 --> 23:48.497
Oh, reasons change.

23:49.350 --> 23:53.149
We go to Georgetown so he can get
a degree in environmental law.

23:53.848 --> 23:56.185
I get pregnant. We run out of money.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.964
- That's when family reels him back in.
- What do you mean?

24:00.684 --> 24:04.593
He slowly became everything he hated.
One molecule at a time.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.404
How long were you 2 married?

24:08.810 --> 24:09.830
147 years.

24:10.921 --> 24:12.513
Why'd you stay so long?

24:13.168 --> 24:16.926
I've stopped asking myself that question
because I hate the answer.

24:17.101 --> 24:20.833
Yes, we're trying to get different drugs
in play at different hospitals.

24:21.017 --> 24:24.311
We'd like St. Joseph's to try
ribavirin and acyclovir.

24:26.036 --> 24:27.062
That's fantastic.

24:27.881 --> 24:28.934
Okay, thank you.

24:34.221 --> 24:37.139
I have been through every
obscure disease website,

24:37.328 --> 24:39.365
I can find... Nothing.

24:44.176 --> 24:45.474
They lost another patient.

24:46.502 --> 24:48.429
- 7 more were admitted.
- 7?

24:48.833 --> 24:50.569
Any connection to the others?

24:52.532 --> 24:53.981
How is it spreading?

24:55.680 --> 24:57.552
How old are the new victims?

24:59.226 --> 25:01.276
30s and 40s.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.635
Where are the young people?
Where are the old?

25:29.965 --> 25:31.086
Morning.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.042
PCR results came back,
confirming the obvious.

25:34.545 --> 25:35.898
It's not West Nile.

25:36.122 --> 25:39.143
Alright, now we know what it isn't.
What the heck is it?

26:19.388 --> 26:20.809
I'm not here.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.328
- What?
- <i>It's me.</i>

26:32.984 --> 26:35.895
- Tell me you know what it is.
- Unidentified.

26:36.381 --> 26:39.948
Well, call the CDC
and let 'em know what you got.

26:40.556 --> 26:42.411
Sure, but here's why I called.

26:42.491 --> 26:45.189
3 of the sick people,
either they or their spouse

26:45.269 --> 26:48.135
paid for a night at the same motel,
on the same night.

26:48.942 --> 26:51.990
- <i>Are you awake?</i>
- No. Where's the motel?

26:52.705 --> 26:55.452
- San Francisco.
- No Mayko, they're from San Francisco.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.834
Why would they stay
at a motel in San Francisco

26:57.914 --> 26:59.300
I don't know. Ask them.

27:00.794 --> 27:02.912
Okay, what are the patient numbers?

27:03.052 --> 27:04.059
<i>3...</i>

27:05.858 --> 27:07.348
<i>13, and 15.</i>

27:09.597 --> 27:11.264
Okay, good work, Mayko.

27:19.980 --> 27:22.946
Dead. Dead. ICU.

27:24.708 --> 27:27.901
- Nothing to do with us.
- They all stayed here, Miss Gryce.

27:28.121 --> 27:31.265
I phoned 2 customers who stayed
on that same floor the night before

27:31.350 --> 27:33.688
and 2 the night after. Nobody's sick.

27:33.978 --> 27:36.097
These people had
rooms on the same floor?

27:37.781 --> 27:38.792
Yeah.

27:39.140 --> 27:42.918
Can we see a list of the guests that
stayed here that night, on that floor?

27:53.257 --> 27:57.740
Mr. and Mrs. Dean Martin, Mr. and
Mrs. Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.903
It's a motel, Sir.

28:00.638 --> 28:04.670
Fine. Do you recognize
any of these people?

28:11.265 --> 28:14.409
Right. I call Public Health.

28:14.612 --> 28:18.179
They find one cockroach turd,
I close you down for a year.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.063
He stayed here with his wife.

28:26.385 --> 28:29.078
They're married.
Why did they need an alias?

28:32.302 --> 28:35.022
What about this woman?
Did she stay here?

28:37.675 --> 28:38.686
Same night?

28:40.231 --> 28:41.256
Same floor?

28:43.862 --> 28:44.862
Yes.

28:48.649 --> 28:52.093
Okay, what's going on?
Who are these people?

28:55.313 --> 28:57.158
The floor was rented for a convention.

28:57.272 --> 28:59.814
Convention? What kind of convention?

29:01.087 --> 29:04.244
The Sinatra Appreciation
Society of San Francisco.

29:05.174 --> 29:06.678
What do they do?

29:06.950 --> 29:08.632
They appreciate.

29:09.722 --> 29:12.743
And who's the head appreciator?

29:13.459 --> 29:17.546
Everything's done by email.
Info@Sinatra or something like that.

29:17.870 --> 29:20.774
All I know is they take
the same floor the first saturday

29:20.886 --> 29:22.991
in march, june, september and december.

29:26.022 --> 29:28.291
And on sundays they go to church.

29:36.505 --> 29:38.323
Nina, it's Doctor Serrano.

29:42.209 --> 29:44.191
Thank you for visiting me.

29:44.877 --> 29:46.627
I need your help, Nina.

29:48.518 --> 29:51.675
Tell me about
the Sinatra Appreciation Society?

29:57.147 --> 29:58.719
I knew it would catch up with me.

30:00.574 --> 30:02.419
Evil has a long memory.

30:04.721 --> 30:05.814
What happened?

30:08.182 --> 30:09.576
I went once.

30:14.516 --> 30:16.648
You know about the sin of lust?

30:17.663 --> 30:19.153
I know a lot about it.

30:21.598 --> 30:25.425
He invited me to join his group.

30:26.978 --> 30:28.728
Now God's punishing me.

30:29.529 --> 30:30.882
Who invited you?

30:50.508 --> 30:54.280
You won't get a better sleep
than with a perfect Dreamcoil 2000.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.653
Roll around, it won't spill.

30:57.166 --> 30:58.629
Try it together.

30:58.902 --> 31:00.488
It's okay. He snores.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.549
It's nice though. Firm.

31:05.028 --> 31:08.336
How is it for... indoor sports?

31:10.884 --> 31:13.795
Well, load it up with all your buddies.
She's built to take it.

31:15.451 --> 31:17.474
Now all I need are a bunch of buddies.

31:17.582 --> 31:20.671
Know how I can get in touch
with Joey, Dino and Sammy D?

31:25.375 --> 31:27.207
Okay, who wants to know?

31:32.249 --> 31:34.163
American Bio... What is this?

31:34.332 --> 31:36.778
We need to know about
the Sinatra swingers club.

31:37.084 --> 31:39.818
Our club is a matter
of personal choice. Okay?

31:39.956 --> 31:42.143
Why don't you tell us
about your personal choice?

31:42.623 --> 31:45.329
You could be in a lot of trouble,
Mr. Braungart.

31:45.478 --> 31:48.279
- What are you talking about?
- You might've made lot of people sick.

31:48.423 --> 31:50.801
- No, that's not true.
- People are dead.

31:50.932 --> 31:53.311
No. We practice safe sex. Okay?

31:53.404 --> 31:57.205
Some viruses can be passed through
saliva, physical contact, coughing...

31:57.293 --> 32:00.338
- Sucking, licking, probing.
- Come on, Pete.

32:00.443 --> 32:03.775
How many partners do
your people have each night?

32:03.875 --> 32:05.956
- I don't know.
- Answer.

32:06.123 --> 32:08.588
I don't know! One? 10? 20?
It's up to them.

32:08.839 --> 32:12.826
Well, we need a list of all the people
who were at your group grope last month.

32:13.455 --> 32:14.457
Look, I...

32:15.164 --> 32:16.982
I really can't tell you that.
It's anonymous.

32:17.062 --> 32:18.475
Life and death, Pete.

32:18.555 --> 32:21.462
I don't know everybody's real name.
Okay?

32:21.578 --> 32:23.080
I swear to God.

32:25.017 --> 32:26.924
How long have you been sick?

32:27.097 --> 32:28.998
Maybe you have our mystery illness.

32:29.345 --> 32:31.057
No, it's just a summer cold, that's all.

32:31.137 --> 32:35.008
- How long have you had it?
- I don't know. Couple of weeks, maybe.

32:36.928 --> 32:40.703
If he has it, why isn't he
in the hospital with the others?

32:41.300 --> 32:42.418
What the fuck?

33:06.581 --> 33:08.611
- What?
<i>- David Sandström?</i>

33:08.691 --> 33:10.375
<i>Angelica Starov.</i>

33:11.024 --> 33:14.230
Yeah, from the Ontario Juvenile
Detention Centre, right?

33:14.310 --> 33:16.572
No. I'm at U of T.

33:17.342 --> 33:21.137
Aren't you the person who called
me about Owen getting in some fights?

33:21.285 --> 33:23.701
He was. He stabbed some kid.

33:23.781 --> 33:26.329
- Oh, Jesus.
<i>- Who needed 12 stitches.</i>

33:26.409 --> 33:27.468
David.

33:27.953 --> 33:29.136
Another death.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.784
- Oh shit.
- One of the nurses is sick too.

33:31.864 --> 33:33.020
So it's communicable.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.965
It could be a secondary infection.
They're doing tests.

33:36.576 --> 33:40.254
He has 32 out of 38 addictive genes,
which is why I believe

33:40.334 --> 33:42.868
Owen would be perfect
for the kind of research I'm doing.

33:42.952 --> 33:45.931
What? Research?
But you're a social worker.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.627
No! I'm scientist!

33:49.487 --> 33:51.336
Peter Braungart's blood work.

33:51.558 --> 33:53.888
Hematologist can't be certain, but

33:53.968 --> 33:57.101
he thinks the blood profile
of interleukins and lymphocytes

33:57.181 --> 34:00.099
- are identical to the other patients.
- So Braungart's got the virus.

34:00.493 --> 34:01.679
A milder case.

34:02.038 --> 34:03.224
Why would it be milder?

34:04.216 --> 34:06.426
He's on a massive dosage of Interferon.

34:06.515 --> 34:07.593
Hep C?

34:08.635 --> 34:10.431
Chronic Granulomatous Disease.

34:10.791 --> 34:11.797
What?

34:11.887 --> 34:13.324
It's a hereditary...

34:13.418 --> 34:15.545
- <i>Hello?!</i>
- I'm here.

34:15.626 --> 34:16.996
Did you get my number?

34:17.085 --> 34:19.313
You know what? I'll call you back.

34:19.784 --> 34:22.313
It's a hereditary disease
where the neutrophyl granulocytes

34:22.393 --> 34:24.599
can't destroy ingested pathogens. So,

34:24.833 --> 34:26.320
they put you on Interferon

34:26.400 --> 34:27.887
To boost your immune system.

34:28.230 --> 34:30.568
This is fantastic. We may
have stumbled on a treatment.

34:30.665 --> 34:31.686
Interferon?

34:32.708 --> 34:33.712
Maybe.

34:33.792 --> 34:36.844
- We can test it on mice.
- That'll take some time.

34:38.784 --> 34:39.808
People.

34:40.494 --> 34:41.608
That's high stakes.

34:44.770 --> 34:48.150
Do you think any of your patients
look like they're gonna recover?

34:53.065 --> 34:54.089
Okay.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.865
There's 2 patients whose
lungs have ceased to function.

34:58.839 --> 35:00.653
They may not last through the night.

35:00.797 --> 35:03.779
I'm willing to take a risk on one
of them if we can get

35:03.886 --> 35:06.168
- family to okay it.
- Good luck.

35:13.288 --> 35:15.144
That was an odd call for you to make.

35:20.505 --> 35:21.978
Nothing else is working.

36:07.898 --> 36:10.593
You're not gonna start reading
to me from that thing are you?

36:11.189 --> 36:13.269
There's nothing wrong with the Bible,
David.

36:13.349 --> 36:16.718
I didn't say there was. I just think
it should come with a disclaimer.

36:16.798 --> 36:18.536
This is a work of fiction.

36:19.203 --> 36:20.370
No, it isn't.

36:21.592 --> 36:23.514
It's the divine word of God?

36:23.981 --> 36:25.576
I didn't say that.

36:25.656 --> 36:28.203
But it's not fiction.
It's a book of myths.

36:29.263 --> 36:30.862
What's the difference?

36:32.012 --> 36:34.298
A single person writes fiction.

36:34.378 --> 36:36.776
It takes an entire
civilization to write a myth.

36:43.456 --> 36:44.731
She...

36:46.330 --> 36:47.480
She didn't make it.

36:58.070 --> 36:59.956
She didn't even last an hour.

37:08.531 --> 37:11.136
It might have been the disease.
We don't know.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.286
- What?
<i>- Miss me?</i>

38:02.687 --> 38:04.120
Where the hell are ya?

38:04.200 --> 38:06.589
- I'm not telling.
- I can't believe I'm talking to you.

38:06.669 --> 38:07.726
Come home!

38:09.129 --> 38:10.336
I miss you guys.

38:10.649 --> 38:12.144
Where are you? What are you doing?

38:13.109 --> 38:14.167
Somewhere.

38:14.870 --> 38:15.871
Teaching,

38:16.204 --> 38:17.768
English and science.

38:17.983 --> 38:20.704
I had a few days off,
so I hit a beach with a friend.

38:20.784 --> 38:23.585
- A friend,
<i>- She's a nun.</i>

38:23.745 --> 38:25.551
<i>- I swear.</i>
- Bullshit.

38:25.733 --> 38:27.031
A Buddhist nun!

38:27.915 --> 38:30.163
So, Bob, Mayko, they're okay?

38:30.243 --> 38:33.589
We just, we miss you like crazy.
When are you coming back?

38:34.355 --> 38:35.906
I need more time.

38:38.479 --> 38:40.107
So I check my email,

38:40.187 --> 38:43.536
for the first time in 2 months
and there are, like 70 from Owen.

38:44.005 --> 38:46.408
Man. I thought you were calling
to talk about me.

38:46.488 --> 38:47.870
You can wait.

38:48.607 --> 38:50.317
I don't think he can.

38:50.397 --> 38:52.743
Seriously, he sounds depressed.
He's got some science thing

38:52.823 --> 38:54.098
he wants you to check into.

38:54.178 --> 38:55.217
What?

38:55.418 --> 38:58.423
<i>Well, have you been checking
in with him, like you promised?</i>

39:00.024 --> 39:03.360
I haven't seen him in, like...
a couple of months.

39:03.536 --> 39:05.846
I know. It's been crazy for you, David.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.211
I know, I know.

39:07.505 --> 39:08.506
<i>Go see him?</i>

39:08.586 --> 39:11.368
I will! I was going to.
When are you coming back?

39:12.008 --> 39:15.515
I still have a lot I need
to figure out about my life.

39:16.273 --> 39:18.760
I think I was hiding behind
that big mountain of work.

39:18.840 --> 39:19.971
Work for me.

39:23.029 --> 39:24.137
I miss you.

39:24.967 --> 39:25.968
I want you.

39:26.806 --> 39:28.402
I want you back here.

39:29.348 --> 39:32.525
I better get off the phone before
you talk me into getting on a plane.

39:34.134 --> 39:35.961
I will see you sometime, David.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.586
Wait, wait. Just...

39:38.076 --> 39:40.850
Look, tell me where you are
and I'll come and visit you.

39:41.216 --> 39:43.626
Love to Bob and Mayko and Carlos.

39:44.933 --> 39:45.934
<i>Even Wes.</i>

39:47.070 --> 39:48.071
What about me?

39:51.136 --> 39:52.153
You too.

40:12.472 --> 40:15.259
So we are now at 7 dead,
36 hospitalizations.

40:15.339 --> 40:18.705
The 4 spouses who were
in quarantine have now been admitted.

40:18.785 --> 40:21.437
Fuck. Mayko, where are we at
with the victimology?

40:21.517 --> 40:24.356
All I could get from the
Sinatra website were member emails.

40:24.436 --> 40:27.455
Most were anonymous addresses.
But I emailed them and

40:27.535 --> 40:29.828
explained the situation,
told them they're the only ones

40:29.908 --> 40:32.261
who know who else
might have contracted this.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.211
Did you tell them
to report to a hospital?

40:34.291 --> 40:36.362
'Course, but I don't know if they went.

40:36.446 --> 40:37.476
Rachel?

40:38.127 --> 40:40.429
Well, we've cloned and
sequenced 32 viruses common

40:40.509 --> 40:42.752
to patients 3, 17, and 19,
and still can't

40:42.832 --> 40:44.711
find the one that explains Sinatra.

40:45.317 --> 40:48.378
- That's what we're calling it.
- Nice. How many do you have left?

40:48.458 --> 40:50.248
- Hundreds.
- Hurry it up.

40:50.349 --> 40:51.783
Well, Rachel and I coo..

40:52.429 --> 40:55.243
The viruses that we have eliminated
are the most likely candidates.

40:55.323 --> 40:57.724
So the work we've
done is actually significant.

40:58.513 --> 40:59.514
Is it?

40:59.594 --> 41:01.567
Well, then,
I'll be patient for the next...

41:03.131 --> 41:04.847
Time's up. Anything else?

41:05.725 --> 41:08.999
One medical worker became infected,
but it looks like she has strep.

41:09.871 --> 41:12.957
We're back to believing that it's only
passed through very intimate contact.

41:14.429 --> 41:15.618
That's the good news.

41:16.059 --> 41:18.813
- Bad news?
- Well, there are still no recoveries.

41:20.367 --> 41:22.265
Okay, here's what I don't understand,

41:22.345 --> 41:23.619
Pete Braungart

41:23.699 --> 41:25.761
is on Interferon, right?
That's why he's alive.

41:25.841 --> 41:28.955
The Interferon gives him the extra
immunity that he needs to live.

41:29.035 --> 41:31.555
So we give this Interferon,
we give this extra immunity to

41:31.635 --> 41:34.258
Nina and she dies.
It doesn't make any sense.

41:34.390 --> 41:36.729
We're still missing
a big piece of the puzzle.

41:37.311 --> 41:39.276
Pete has Chronic Granulomatous, right?

41:39.663 --> 41:42.068
It's a disorder of the phagocytic cells.

41:42.733 --> 41:44.029
It's a strange disease.

41:44.109 --> 41:46.953
Only 1000 Americans have it, 86% male.

41:47.317 --> 41:49.303
And it's rare to live to be an adult.

41:49.496 --> 41:51.813
They think it's associated with 4 genes.

41:51.893 --> 41:54.929
CYB-B, CYB-A, NCF-1 and NCF-2.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.901
Maybe those genes are the key.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.506
That's good, Bob.

42:03.077 --> 42:04.179
Work that up, okay.

42:05.452 --> 42:06.510
Have a good day.

42:34.606 --> 42:35.765
How you doin'?

42:40.516 --> 42:43.352
So, what's the drug of choice in here?
Crystal?

42:44.388 --> 42:45.573
- No.
- No?

42:46.977 --> 42:48.267
- Yeah.
-Yeah?

42:49.935 --> 42:51.115
Sometimes. Not much.

42:51.195 --> 42:53.562
- Think that's a good idea?
- You try being in here.

42:53.642 --> 42:54.646
Have a seat.

43:06.033 --> 43:08.884
I hear you've been
getting in some fights.

43:09.061 --> 43:10.073
Knifed a guy.

43:10.742 --> 43:11.553
That's VD.

43:12.172 --> 43:13.972
Got a venereal disease too?

43:14.052 --> 43:16.824
No. Violent and Dangerous.
That's what they call this place.

43:16.904 --> 43:19.209
Well, that's still
no excuse for the stabbing.

43:19.289 --> 43:20.702
Come on you're a smart guy.

43:20.782 --> 43:23.021
You know how to talk
yourself out of a tight spot.

43:25.093 --> 43:26.842
2 guys tried to rape me, alright?

43:27.340 --> 43:29.986
Now my lawyer says my case
is fucked because of the fight

43:30.066 --> 43:31.654
for protecting myself.

43:32.101 --> 43:34.063
So I'm looking at even longer in here.

43:34.652 --> 43:35.687
I'll uh...

43:37.267 --> 43:39.305
- I'll talk to your lawyer.
- Fuck that noise.

43:39.385 --> 43:40.954
I'm gonna do this thing with Angie.

43:41.034 --> 43:42.063
Who?

43:42.956 --> 43:44.934
Angie. Scientist. Russian.

43:45.199 --> 43:46.414
Smokin' hot.

43:46.494 --> 43:49.622
I spoke to somebody about you.
Is that who I was talking to?

43:49.702 --> 43:51.548
Are you fucking retarded? Yes!

43:51.681 --> 43:54.527
She's doing this thing
about knocking out addiction.

43:54.686 --> 43:56.626
- She's gonna do it on me.
- Wait a minute.

43:56.706 --> 43:57.833
What are you talking about?

43:58.110 --> 43:59.936
I don't know. She fixes addicts by

44:00.016 --> 44:02.102
messing with the biology
in their brains.

44:02.526 --> 44:04.853
The science is way off.

44:05.263 --> 44:06.904
But that's what you said had to happen.

44:07.119 --> 44:08.898
I was talking about your genes.

44:09.902 --> 44:11.667
She just does it with your brain.

44:12.152 --> 44:13.076
How?

44:13.381 --> 44:16.387
- I don't know. She does it on mice!
- That's mice, Owen!

44:16.467 --> 44:17.809
She's going to do it on me.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.420
- No, it's ridiculous.
- She's going to do it.

44:25.299 --> 44:28.381
It sounds like your mind is all made up.
So what am I here for?

44:28.461 --> 44:30.532
You want my permission?
I'm not your old man.

44:33.403 --> 44:36.145
You want me to tell you it's
all gonna be okay. Is that it?

44:36.225 --> 44:39.412
Well, I'm not gonna do that,
cuz it's not gonna be okay!

44:40.352 --> 44:41.439
Forget it, Owen.

44:42.196 --> 44:43.700
Look, my lawyer says that if

44:43.780 --> 44:47.202
I volunteer to be a test subject
then I got a shot at getting outta here.

44:47.282 --> 44:49.426
Look, I cannot stay in here, David!

44:52.296 --> 44:53.363
Just call her.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.872
David.

45:07.099 --> 45:08.596
Really bad time right now Wes.

45:08.676 --> 45:10.377
- It's gonna get a lot worse.
- What?

45:10.457 --> 45:12.782
We just got a priority alert
of an outbreak in Boston.

45:13.409 --> 45:16.882
13 thirty-somethings, male and female,
in critical condition, one fatality.

45:16.962 --> 45:17.963
Symptoms?

45:18.043 --> 45:21.036
Fever, headache, sore neck,
convulsions, coma, pneumonia.

45:21.116 --> 45:23.389
- Sinatra?
- Looks that way.

45:23.469 --> 45:24.547
Fuck.

45:25.328 --> 45:27.123
Okay, Carlos and I on the next flight.

45:27.548 --> 45:29.368
Get Mayko in the loop
with Richard Shrider.

45:29.457 --> 45:31.915
Tell him we need
to figure out if any friends,

45:31.995 --> 45:35.426
relatives, or colleagues of the patients
in San Francisco travelled to Boston.

45:35.506 --> 45:36.524
I'm on it.

45:39.686 --> 45:40.798
Guys!

45:41.642 --> 45:44.046
This little virus is already
starting to jump cities

45:44.126 --> 45:46.591
and we still don't know
what the fuck it is!

45:46.671 --> 45:47.845
We're losing!

45:51.960 --> 45:53.443
We're losing.

45:55.915 --> 45:57.536
I asked you to help me.

45:57.616 --> 45:59.453
You told me that
my addiction could be fixed.

45:59.533 --> 46:01.911
Owen! What I told you was we might be

46:01.991 --> 46:03.821
able to turn off the addiction genes

46:03.901 --> 46:06.641
in you but the science is like,
15 years from now.

46:06.721 --> 46:07.993
Angelica can do it now.

46:08.648 --> 46:11.086
I'll talk to her.

46:12.939 --> 46:14.818
Isn't appetite related to the same

46:14.898 --> 46:16.699
neurological pathway as addiction?

46:17.691 --> 46:21.671
Fever, headache, stiffness,
convulsions, pneumonia, coma.

46:21.751 --> 46:24.494
Wes, the Boston patients
are all parents of infants.

46:24.574 --> 46:27.562
The outbreak seems to be centered around
a place in a mall where kids play.

46:28.380 --> 46:30.286
Where are you Sinatra?

46:30.950 --> 46:34.797
We've got the beginnings of a
pandemic here and we don't have a clue.
