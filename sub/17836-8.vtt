WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:03.902
<i>Previously on</i> Teen Wolf...

00:03.904 --> 00:05.584
I'll never stop until
we get everyone back.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.307
What if this was his room?

00:08.309 --> 00:11.443
<i>What if this means we had a son?</i>

00:11.445 --> 00:13.612
<i>Mr. Douglas
ate his pineal gland.</i>

00:14.481 --> 00:15.581
What are you doing?

00:34.768 --> 00:37.870
Gentlemen, imagine an army

00:37.872 --> 00:42.241
not burdened with the
weakness of ordinary soldiers.

00:46.279 --> 00:49.648
Men who don't need food.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.117
Who never grow tired.

00:52.119 --> 00:55.187
An army of unstoppable warriors.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.263
The wild hunt.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.599
The living can fight
until they break.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.335
The dead do not break.

01:10.337 --> 01:14.039
This is what the <i> Ahnenerbe</i>
has been searching for.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.975
"Ghost riders of the storm,"

01:16.977 --> 01:20.579
"masters of infinite power."

01:20.581 --> 01:22.414
We are not chasing
fairy tales,<i> Hauptmann.</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:25.250
The occult is nothing
to toy with.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.586
Neither are the riders
of the storm.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.021
You have seen them?

01:29.023 --> 01:30.656
They are in the Ruhr valley.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.691
My <i> Kampfgruppe</i> can secure
the area tonight.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.893
An unstoppable army?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.396
Made up of the dead, you say?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.765
With power you have never seen.

01:40.934 --> 01:46.071
Tell me, how would you control
this unstoppable army?

01:46.073 --> 01:49.141
How do you stop the unstoppable?

01:51.444 --> 01:55.881
How is your
<i>Kampfgruppe</i> going to stop them?

02:02.222 --> 02:06.825
Tell us. How are you
going to perform this miracle?

02:07.694 --> 02:09.495
With German efficiency.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.740
You're going to bite Stiles?

06:18.077 --> 06:19.811
To get him through the rift.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.850
It's the only way.

06:24.852 --> 06:29.054
Just to clarify, are you planning on
biting everyone in the train station?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.423
With Stiles back, he'll be able
to help us figure out a plan.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.724
He's good at that.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.027
So the plan is to get Stiles
to come up with a plan.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.096
You can shut up now.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.898
Malia, look around.
We're the only ones left in Beacon Hills.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.667
If they take us, Lydia will be the
only one left to haunt the place.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.369
That's why I'm the only
person that's going in.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.737
Liam and Hayden
will stay here with Mason.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.473
As long as somebody
is left in Beacon Hills,

06:48.475 --> 06:49.841
the wild hunt can't move on.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.576
I like your plan, Scott.
I really do,

06:51.578 --> 06:54.112
especially the part
about turning Stiles.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.215
But it can't work.
How do you know?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.683
Logic. Life experience.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.285
Liam, what are the odds
that he'll get taken?

07:00.287 --> 07:01.620
What if Stiles isn't there?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.455
What if there's no Beacon Hills
for you to come back to?

07:03.457 --> 07:04.523
You got a better idea?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.925
Yeah. It's called,
"run like hell."

07:08.361 --> 07:10.195
So, leave in five?

07:11.330 --> 07:13.265
You promised you'd help us.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.466
We still need to find the rift.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.835
I didn't promise
I'd help you commit suicide.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.771
If you can't help,
we can find it ourselves.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.742
Scott, I admit that you have
a flair for beating the odds.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.345
But, this?
You don't walk away from.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.148
You run.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.840
His tracks outside
lead north from here.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.193
Oh.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.665
This one's gone, too.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.303
Why take
a ghost rider's pineal gland?

08:25.305 --> 08:26.571
So I could use this.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.650
What do you want?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.019
Not our pineal gland, I hope.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.020
We're still using them.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.524
I want you to help me
find a hellhound.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.393
You were tracking him.
You lost his scent.

08:48.395 --> 08:51.162
I found him on you.
Which tells me...

08:51.164 --> 08:54.299
Nothing. I can't help you.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.967
That's too bad.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.237
Then I have no use for you.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.678
Not fast enough.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.123
We'll do it.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.626
We'll do it. Just let him go.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.162
Let him go!

09:32.872 --> 09:36.308
Thank you for volunteering,
<i>Herr</i> argent.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.630
At least we found his cell.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.665
That means something.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.236
It's a relic.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.871
That only means one thing.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.873
It means he's not dead, Mason.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.043
And that there's still a chance.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.015
He only has pictures of us.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.118
There's, like,
a hundred pictures here.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.188
And it's just us.
Is that a little weird?

10:24.256 --> 10:27.659
No. It means he loves you.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.101
We need to get him back.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.775
When you were here before,

10:43.777 --> 10:46.111
how long until
the ghost riders showed up?

10:46.113 --> 10:48.647
A couple minutes.
That's reassuring.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.082
What's a rift
supposed to look like?

10:51.084 --> 10:53.585
If it's a tear
in the fabric of our world.

10:53.587 --> 10:57.956
Theoretically it could look like
anything from a microscopic black hole

10:57.958 --> 11:01.026
to a free-floating
Einstein-Rosen bridge.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.005
I really hope it's not up there.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.743
Let's split up.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.583
Hey, look at this.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.464
The rift's not above us.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.734
It's below.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.411
So we should stay here.
Is that what you're thinking?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.281
It doesn't matter where we are.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.283
We still need to figure out
how to fight them.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.351
No one can fight them.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.120
Douglas can.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.655
Does he need to stay in there?

12:03.657 --> 12:04.789
He's still Theo.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.158
Theo saved Scott. Remember?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.359
He can still hear you.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.130
Then he can hear me say
he needs to shut up

12:12.132 --> 12:15.033
so we can figure out how
to fight the ghost riders.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.669
You don't need to figure it out.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.404
Because Douglas already did.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.575
If he knew how to fight them,

12:23.577 --> 12:25.343
then he might know
everything about them.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.413
And guess who knows
all about Mr. Douglas?

12:34.487 --> 12:37.088
I can't see a thing.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.190
It's got to be
down here somewhere.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.336
Found it!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.510
It's remarkably similar.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.044
To what?

13:01.514 --> 13:03.248
To the Einstein-Rosen bridge.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.684
<i>That's never going to happen.</i>

13:06.686 --> 13:08.253
We're not making that deal.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.388
I hold all the cards.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.958
You're locked in a jail cell.
You have no cards.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.693
You want me to tell you
about Douglas.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.197
Break the sword.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.968
Does anyone else want
to do the negotiating?

13:25.171 --> 13:26.404
Break the sword.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.573
I'll break the sword.
I'll break it right in...

13:28.575 --> 13:29.841
Hayden.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.814
You break, I talk.

13:37.683 --> 13:39.350
Come on, guys.

13:40.252 --> 13:43.221
Look, I don't want
in anyone's pack.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.991
I don't want anyone's power.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.361
I just wanna stay alive.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.797
How do we know
if we let you out, you won't run?

13:52.799 --> 13:54.332
'Cause we're not
letting him out.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.967
He's going to tell us
from in here.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.838
I'm still going to
need some incentive.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.212
He's a <i> Löwenmensch.</i>

14:41.214 --> 14:43.381
What the hell is a <i> Löwenmensch?</i>

14:43.383 --> 14:45.016
It's part-wolf, part-lion.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.320
He was a part of the <i> Ahnenerbe,</i>

14:49.322 --> 14:52.724
<i>Himmler's personal project
to use the occult to win the war.</i>

15:08.307 --> 15:11.276
<i>Hauptmann,</i> you should stay away.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.912
All of us, we should stay away.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.314
You've seen them, grenadier?

15:16.316 --> 15:19.851
They came by storm.
They rode horses.

15:19.853 --> 15:22.287
They were unnatural.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.389
Over here!

15:25.724 --> 15:27.926
We are close. Spread out!

15:32.298 --> 15:35.333
You've done well,
grenadier Abel.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.069
The <i> fuhrer</i> will be pleased.

15:54.586 --> 15:55.987
Everyone step back.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.108
Please.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.144
No.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.915
<i>Hauptmann,</i> no.

16:23.917 --> 16:27.285
Thank you for volunteering,

16:28.620 --> 16:30.188
grenadier Abel.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.630
<i>Schnell.</i>

17:29.581 --> 17:30.648
Incredible.

17:55.941 --> 17:57.241
Take him.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.298
Douglas didn't beat
a ghost rider.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.268
He ran.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.471
We broke the sword for nothing.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.073
Wait, if that was back in 1943,

19:36.075 --> 19:38.209
where's he been all this time?

19:38.211 --> 19:39.944
Douglas kept looking.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.881
He found a scientist that
he thought could help him.

19:45.717 --> 19:46.784
Three of them.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.541
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no! Stop!

20:26.491 --> 20:29.327
<i>The ghost rider's whip
didn't go deep enough to take him,</i>

20:29.329 --> 20:31.529
<i>but left a gash on his back.</i>

20:31.531 --> 20:34.332
<i>He was thrown into the tank
and the wound infected the water.</i>

20:34.334 --> 20:36.067
It mixed with the fluid
from the vat

20:36.069 --> 20:38.502
and actually made him stronger.

20:38.504 --> 20:42.607
Soaking it in, absorbing
the power for 70 years.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.943
So, he came out with
the power of an Alpha,

20:45.945 --> 20:48.713
a <i> Löwenmensch,</i>
and a ghost rider.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.881
A side effect
no one could expect.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.316
So he can fight them.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.220
He could stop them.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.989
The Nazis lost the war.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.557
Why is he still obsessed?

20:59.559 --> 21:01.459
What does he want an army for?

21:02.127 --> 21:04.161
He doesn't want it for them.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.431
The Nazis were just a means
to an end.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.967
He wants it for himself.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.904
His own personal,
supernatural army.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.707
We need to warn Scott.

21:50.342 --> 21:53.444
You know what the best part
about being a werewolf is?

21:53.446 --> 21:55.546
Supernatural hearing.

22:01.219 --> 22:02.620
Did you hear that?

22:19.104 --> 22:22.573
Parrish. Parrish, wake up.
Parrish.

22:25.977 --> 22:27.078
I'm sorry.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.346
No.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.620
Parrish!

22:38.056 --> 22:39.790
Parrish!

22:40.459 --> 22:42.360
Parrish, wake up.

22:44.496 --> 22:47.231
That was very brave.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.666
But pointless.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.771
Just crack the whip.

23:26.304 --> 23:27.605
Yeah, Liam, come on.
We gotta hurry.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.039
We can still find him.

23:41.853 --> 23:42.920
No!

23:43.955 --> 23:45.689
Liam. Run!

24:11.216 --> 24:12.683
Liam.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.236
We have to get to Scott.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.330
Liam.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.333
You have to find Scott.

26:09.335 --> 26:10.801
I'm not leaving you.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.709
You have to.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.611
You can save me
on the other side.

26:26.551 --> 26:27.818
I believe in you.

26:29.621 --> 26:30.888
I love you.

26:33.325 --> 26:34.592
Then go.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.388
There's gotta be another way.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.258
We just need to think.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.361
- Think?
- Yeah.

27:10.363 --> 27:12.596
Think about how to get through
a supernatural rift

27:12.598 --> 27:14.098
that melts steel.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.167
I didn't say it would be easy.

27:17.169 --> 27:20.738
But it doesn't have
to be so hard.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.543
Why is this suddenly
so important?

27:26.545 --> 27:28.445
Why can't it wait
until tomorrow?

27:28.447 --> 27:30.514
I... I don't know
how it happened,

27:30.516 --> 27:31.682
but it happened.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.884
Everything Lydia has been
trying to tell us?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.653
It's all true.

27:47.165 --> 27:51.769
His bed, the clothes
he never folds, his crime board.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.707
He's on the lacrosse team.

27:56.709 --> 27:59.743
I mean, he's terrible,
but he's on the team.

28:02.147 --> 28:03.347
Claudia,

28:05.450 --> 28:06.917
we have a son.

28:08.586 --> 28:11.855
And we can find him
and get him back.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.390
There's nothing here.

28:23.301 --> 28:25.969
You gotta come
in the room, baby.

28:29.407 --> 28:30.774
Come on.

28:43.589 --> 28:47.057
Noah, there's still
nothing here.

29:03.341 --> 29:04.408
You're here.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.049
He followed our scent.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.051
I followed your desperation.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.888
We're all in a tough spot.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.791
Desperate to get inside
and save everyone,

29:20.793 --> 29:25.329
and hoping to find a way
to stop this army of the dead.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.830
We all want the same thing.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.265
He has a point.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.233
If he doesn't kill anyone.

29:29.235 --> 29:32.002
Else. If he doesn't
kill anyone else.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.838
All that matters right now
is getting through the rift.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.173
Then you're out of luck.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.841
The rift burns anything
that tries to pass through it.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.109
Perhaps not everything.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.350
Jordan.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.954
If the hellhound can open
the rift, we all go together.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.156
You're the bad guy.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.491
I'm pretty sure helping you
is a bad idea.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.660
Good guy. Bad guy.

29:56.662 --> 29:59.396
When has anything ever been
so black and white?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.465
World war ii.

30:03.268 --> 30:04.368
He's a Nazi.

30:05.069 --> 30:07.070
He wants the hunt for himself.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.173
He wants his own
supernatural army.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.647
We're not letting you
through that rift.

30:16.649 --> 30:17.915
"Not letting" me?

30:18.149 --> 30:19.750
I see.

30:19.752 --> 30:22.119
You still think you have
a say in the matter.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.513
<i>Höllenhund.</i>

30:55.253 --> 30:56.320
Parrish, stop!

31:09.834 --> 31:11.101
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

31:20.378 --> 31:21.445
Now.

31:28.486 --> 31:29.553
No.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.297
Noah?

31:41.299 --> 31:42.366
Noah?

31:48.273 --> 31:50.807
I don't remember your birthday
last year.

31:54.345 --> 31:57.414
Or what we did
for our anniversary or Christmas for...

31:59.884 --> 32:01.919
I don't know how many years.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.621
That's ridiculous.
We went to Big Sur.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.459
No.

32:10.795 --> 32:12.729
We always wanted
to go to Big Sur.

32:12.731 --> 32:15.032
We did. I remember.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.035
No, baby.

32:19.904 --> 32:21.271
We didn't.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.478
I took this picture
on your last good day.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.051
Stiles refused to leave
your side.

32:34.053 --> 32:37.354
I was sick.
But I started getting better.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.122
You were yourself all day.

32:39.124 --> 32:42.292
Stiles had his mom back and I...

32:45.129 --> 32:46.730
I had my wife back.

32:48.099 --> 32:50.500
The medication
had started to work.

32:52.837 --> 32:55.539
Stiles couldn't stop talking

32:55.541 --> 32:58.709
about school, all the trouble
he'd gotten into.

32:58.711 --> 33:01.411
He tried so hard to stay awake.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.715
When he finally fell asleep,
it was in your arms.

33:04.717 --> 33:07.150
The doctors couldn't explain it.

33:07.152 --> 33:10.220
We started making plans,
started dreaming again.

33:11.856 --> 33:13.690
We just sat together

33:16.661 --> 33:18.495
and watched each other.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.034
We didn't need to talk.

33:28.139 --> 33:30.474
But, when you finally
closed your eyes,

33:31.676 --> 33:33.310
I was myself again.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.381
I knew you were gone.

34:20.358 --> 34:22.092
Liam, you and Lydia
get to the bunker.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.380
The whip.
It didn't take you.

34:44.382 --> 34:45.449
I don't think they're
trying to take us.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.771
I think they're trying
to kill us.

35:28.893 --> 35:31.194
Why aren't you running?

35:50.915 --> 35:52.215
Go!

36:10.334 --> 36:11.768
That roar wasn't promising.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.304
Well, they rarely are.
Keep going. Keep going.

36:25.883 --> 36:26.950
What's happening?

36:26.952 --> 36:29.486
I don't know.
But stay behind me.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.191
Follow me.

36:53.711 --> 36:54.778
It's afraid of you.

36:57.615 --> 36:58.682
I'm afraid of me.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.392
<i>The number you have
reached is not in service.</i>

37:09.394 --> 37:12.329
<i>Please check the number
or try your call again.</i>

37:12.331 --> 37:13.697
<i>This is a recording.</i>

37:18.237 --> 37:22.806
<i>We're sorry, the number you have reached
is not in service.</i>

37:22.808 --> 37:25.242
<i>Please check the number
or try your call again.</i>

37:25.244 --> 37:27.143
Scott.
<i>This is a recording.</i>

37:44.495 --> 37:47.597
Scott, your mom is gone.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.267
But she's still alive.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.410
What do we do now?

38:01.045 --> 38:02.545
We can't hide from them.

38:03.848 --> 38:05.315
What about Lydia?

38:06.183 --> 38:07.584
The ghost rider was
afraid of her.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.387
It wasn't fear.
It's...

38:13.824 --> 38:16.693
Almost like reverence.

38:16.695 --> 38:17.994
Doesn't matter.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.796
The rift is gone.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.731
We're the only ones left
in Beacon Hills.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.579
I have a son.

38:39.116 --> 38:41.484
His name is Michislav Stilinski.

38:42.553 --> 38:44.020
But we call him Stiles.

38:46.190 --> 38:47.590
I remember.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.195
When Stiles was a little kid,

38:52.197 --> 38:54.030
he couldn't say his first name.

38:54.699 --> 38:55.899
Not sure why.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.401
It pretty much rolls off
the tongue. But, uh,

38:59.403 --> 39:02.706
the closest he could get
was "mischief."

39:03.507 --> 39:06.042
His mother called him that
until...

39:11.149 --> 39:13.249
I remember when, uh...

39:13.251 --> 39:15.819
When Stiles first got his jeep.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.522
It belonged to his mother.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.391
She wanted him to have it.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.560
The first time when he took
a spin behind the wheel,

39:23.562 --> 39:26.496
he went straight into a ditch.

39:27.898 --> 39:31.067
I gave him his first roll
of duct tape that day.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.572
He was always getting
into trouble.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.575
But he always had a good heart.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.543
Always.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.413
We're here tonight

39:44.148 --> 39:46.149
because my goofball son

39:47.017 --> 39:50.420
decided to drag Scott,

39:50.422 --> 39:52.655
his greatest friend
in the world,

39:54.225 --> 39:56.726
into the woods
to see a dead body.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.497
How did you remember?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.168
It started with Stiles' jersey.

40:07.037 --> 40:09.773
Then I found the red string
for his crime board.

40:10.708 --> 40:13.576
Finally, his whole room
came back

40:14.445 --> 40:16.079
and all the memories.

40:19.183 --> 40:21.451
And then the strangest thing
happened.

40:22.787 --> 40:24.287
What?

40:24.289 --> 40:25.688
I thought I saw him.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.225
It's like

40:29.227 --> 40:33.630
something opened right there
in the middle of the room.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.065
Just for a moment.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.068
And then it was gone.

40:40.004 --> 40:41.070
A rift.

40:43.674 --> 40:46.276
I thought
there was only one rift.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.677
We saw it disappear.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.881
You remembered Stiles

40:52.750 --> 40:54.517
and then a new rift was created.

40:55.319 --> 40:58.087
If the sheriff can do it...
Maybe we can.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.656
But that rift closed.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.024
Then we'll open it again.

41:01.759 --> 41:02.959
How?

41:04.663 --> 41:06.062
By remembering Stiles.

41:08.098 --> 41:09.766
We have to remember everything.
