WEBVTT

00:17.654 --> 00:19.324
- Is that-- oh, it's okay.
- You-- it's just--

00:19.359 --> 00:21.161
Can we just-just like that?
Is that good?

00:21.196 --> 00:22.492
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah,
we can go slow.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.273
- You close?
- Um, I...

00:34.308 --> 00:36.275
I think I lost it.

00:36.310 --> 00:38.310
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

00:38.345 --> 00:40.510
- But do you want to--
- Stop? Yeah, no, we can stop.

00:40.545 --> 00:42.677
Oh, oh, great, yeah-yeah,
I have to go to work.

00:42.712 --> 00:44.151
- So, okay, all right.
- Yeah, no, that's okay.

00:44.186 --> 00:45.416
Good try.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.191
Do you wanna
try again tonight?

00:51.226 --> 00:53.523
Maybe? I don't know,
I'm supposed to meet

00:53.558 --> 00:55.162
with Doug later,
so I don't really know

00:55.197 --> 00:56.295
what kind of mood
I'm gonna be in.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.626
Sorry, I always forget

00:57.661 --> 00:58.693
you have a parole officer.

00:58.728 --> 01:00.431
He's a probation officer.

01:00.466 --> 01:01.696
It's not a parole--
I didn't go to jail.

01:01.731 --> 01:03.335
That's the difference,
I keep

01:03.370 --> 01:05.205
explaining that,
and you don't...

01:05.240 --> 01:07.273
Do you wanna try
this weekend?

01:07.308 --> 01:08.868
Maybe!

01:32.960 --> 01:34.696
Hi.

01:34.731 --> 01:36.434
My name's Jack Brown,
I was curious if I could

01:36.469 --> 01:37.666
talk to you about
saving the planet today.

01:37.701 --> 01:39.371
Uh, no, no.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.744
Oh, hi, did you want
a fitting room,

01:49.779 --> 01:51.284
or should I wrap it up
for you?

01:51.319 --> 01:52.681
- Just ring it up please.
- Okay.

01:52.716 --> 01:54.584
Can you put me on the list?

01:54.619 --> 01:56.322
- Yeah, sure, of course.
- For, like,

01:56.357 --> 01:58.192
- not to come back?
- "Do not come back."

01:58.227 --> 01:59.886
I wanna-- I wanna be
on the list that's like,

01:59.921 --> 02:02.460
never come here again
for you and your peers.

02:03.892 --> 02:05.529
I'll take this too.

02:05.564 --> 02:07.465
Oh, um, off the mannequin?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.929
Just-- I'll take it.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.305
- Okay.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.835
- Hey-yo!
- Hey, my name's Jack Brown.

02:14.870 --> 02:17.376
Yeah, you're
from Titty Bingo.

02:17.411 --> 02:18.740
Excuse me?

02:22.350 --> 02:23.811
You know what?
Never mind.

02:23.846 --> 02:25.615
Wait, no, what's--
what's Titty Bingo?

02:25.650 --> 02:27.848
Oh, that's from
the Spring Resort collection.

02:30.853 --> 02:32.787
- Yes.
- Okay.

02:36.793 --> 02:37.891
Why?

02:42.832 --> 02:44.535
Oh, hey, welcome
to the store--

02:44.570 --> 02:45.932
Just looking.

03:01.785 --> 03:03.620
- Caught you!

03:04.986 --> 03:06.920
- Um...
- Where's that from?

03:06.955 --> 03:09.692
- Um, the... sorry?
- The wine.

03:09.727 --> 03:12.959
Oh, uh... the bottle?

03:12.994 --> 03:14.763
You're fun.

03:14.798 --> 03:16.237
You're fun.
That's a fun answer.

03:18.835 --> 03:20.769
Mm-- mm!

03:20.804 --> 03:22.969
Ugh, who serves
room temperature rosé?

03:23.004 --> 03:24.971
Ugh, my boss.

03:27.943 --> 03:29.349
That dress is good on you.

03:29.384 --> 03:30.878
Uh, it-- it's not mine,

03:30.913 --> 03:32.319
we, you know,
we have to wear stuff

03:32.354 --> 03:33.914
from the store, so...

03:33.949 --> 03:36.455
I mean, I...

03:36.490 --> 03:38.721
I would love to show you
something similar,

03:38.756 --> 03:40.459
or you could even--
you could try this one on.

03:40.494 --> 03:42.461
Why'd you do that?

03:42.496 --> 03:44.694
Well, I work here, so.

03:44.729 --> 03:48.368
No, why'd you deflect
when I gave you a compliment?

03:48.403 --> 03:49.732
- Oh, I--
- Is that something

03:49.767 --> 03:51.734
- you normally do?
- Um...

03:51.769 --> 03:53.934
You shouldn't do that.

03:53.969 --> 03:55.639
No, we would never talk
to anyone else

03:55.674 --> 03:57.311
the way we talk
to ourselves.

03:57.346 --> 03:58.675
My friend Renée Brown
says that.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.545
- Oh--
- Come with me.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.813
Oh, my God,
you're so tall.

04:04.848 --> 04:08.421
- I know.
- No, it's amazing.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.391
You're like a valkyrie
or an Amazonian.

04:11.426 --> 04:13.393
You look like Wonder Woman.

04:13.428 --> 04:15.923
Look at you,
you're so powerful.

04:15.958 --> 04:17.595
You look amazing, right?

04:18.664 --> 04:20.961
Say it.

04:20.996 --> 04:22.699
You look amazing.

04:22.734 --> 04:25.702
- Say it.
- No, it's-- no.

04:25.737 --> 04:27.803
- You look amazing.
- I...

04:29.004 --> 04:30.938
"I look amazing."

04:30.973 --> 04:32.742
Now you.

04:32.777 --> 04:34.007
I look amazing.

04:34.042 --> 04:35.712
Yeah, one more time.

04:35.747 --> 04:38.077
- I look amazing.
- Okay, one more time.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.519
- I look amazing.
- Now I believe you.

04:42.050 --> 04:44.556
We're just having fun.

04:44.591 --> 04:46.723
I love that. I'm Catherine.
People call me Cat.

04:46.758 --> 04:48.725
I'm Lindsay.
People just--

04:48.760 --> 04:50.793
- Lindz?
- --call me Lindsay.

04:50.828 --> 04:53.026
I'm gonna call you Lindz.

04:53.061 --> 04:54.764
You're about to go
on break, right?

04:54.799 --> 04:56.128
- Oh, I don't--
- I feel like

04:56.163 --> 04:58.064
you're about to go on break.

04:58.099 --> 05:01.133
In the back of my mind,
I just, I've always wanted

05:01.168 --> 05:03.641
to be a designer,
and then I got...

05:03.676 --> 05:05.643
I don't know, here I am.

05:05.678 --> 05:08.712
Working at a store,
and Jack is--

05:08.747 --> 05:10.450
I'm sorry,
I'm a little embarrassed,

05:10.485 --> 05:11.979
I'm just,
I'm rambling on and on.

05:12.014 --> 05:13.717
- No, no-no.
- I-- we should--

05:13.752 --> 05:15.389
let's just stop
talking about me.

05:15.424 --> 05:18.425
Lindz, honestly,

05:18.460 --> 05:20.119
I'm just happy to be
talking to another person

05:20.154 --> 05:22.121
- who's married.
- Oh, are your friends

05:22.156 --> 05:24.123
- not married?
- Well, I don't really...

05:24.158 --> 05:26.664
- have a lot of friends.
- Oh, my God.

05:26.699 --> 05:28.996
- I don't either.
- Well, who has time?

05:29.031 --> 05:31.097
- Right?
- You know? Work, kids.

05:31.132 --> 05:33.000
- Blah.
- Oh, you have kids.

05:33.035 --> 05:34.705
Twins.
You don't?

05:34.740 --> 05:36.740
Oh, no, no.

05:36.775 --> 05:38.940
No twins, no kids, um,

05:38.975 --> 05:40.909
we, you know,
we talked about it,

05:40.944 --> 05:42.977
and it's not like
we're not-- not trying,

05:43.012 --> 05:44.781
we're just not trying,

05:44.816 --> 05:46.178
- you know?
- Well, good for you.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.048
- We need more wine.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.753
- What's her name?
- Um, Georgia?

05:49.788 --> 05:51.183
Georgia!

05:51.218 --> 05:52.921
- Hey, Georgia!
- Oh, God.

05:52.956 --> 05:54.692
Yeah, you.

05:56.795 --> 05:58.498
Is there something
I can help you with?

05:58.533 --> 06:00.434
My friend Lindz is
entertaining me,

06:00.469 --> 06:02.161
and we would just
love another bottle

06:02.196 --> 06:03.602
of that delicious rosé
you're pouring.

06:03.637 --> 06:05.802
Oh, Lindz, is it now?

06:05.837 --> 06:07.705
Well, Lindz,
if your friend isn't

06:07.740 --> 06:09.069
going to buy anything,
I'm going to have to ask her

06:09.104 --> 06:11.137
- to leave.
- Is she talking to me?

06:11.172 --> 06:13.645
- Yes, I am.
- I'm sorry.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.143
- You're going to leave.
- Oh, okay.

06:17.178 --> 06:19.046
I-- okay,
I think she's mad.

06:19.081 --> 06:21.554
Um, Lindz,
you get commission, right?

06:21.589 --> 06:24.722
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great, okay.

06:24.757 --> 06:27.791
Georgia? I'm gonna
take care of this.

06:27.826 --> 06:29.661
Have you ever thought
about meditating?

06:29.696 --> 06:32.763
So, then Cat points
to an entire rack and says,

06:32.798 --> 06:34.633
"I'll take all of that
in a size two."

06:34.668 --> 06:35.997
Points to another rack
and says,

06:36.032 --> 06:37.768
"I'll take all of that
in a size four,"

06:37.803 --> 06:39.572
because she gains weight
when they go to France.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.233
And then she says,
"I'll take all of the boots

06:41.268 --> 06:43.906
in a seven, and then
whatever Lindz likes."

06:43.941 --> 06:46.139
- Ooh, "Lindz."
- Yeah, whatever Lindz likes.

06:46.174 --> 06:48.009
You fucking hate
when people call you Lindz.

06:48.044 --> 06:50.209
What? No, I-- sorry,
what was I saying?

06:50.244 --> 06:52.244
You just threw me
off track.

06:52.279 --> 06:55.082
Uh, boots and then
whatever Lindz likes.

06:55.117 --> 06:57.788
Yes, whatever Lindz likes
from the jewelry.

06:57.823 --> 06:59.691
"You know what, actually
I'm just gonna take

06:59.726 --> 07:01.253
- all of the jewelry."
- Oh, fuck.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.827
Yeah! "And I want it
hand-wrapped,

07:03.862 --> 07:05.994
individually, by you."

07:06.029 --> 07:09.162
- She said that to Georgia?
- To Georgia.

07:09.197 --> 07:11.230
- And you're not fired?
- No!

07:11.265 --> 07:13.001
I sold more in ten minutes

07:13.036 --> 07:14.706
than that boutique has
sold in six months.

07:14.741 --> 07:17.577
- Nice.
- Then she takes my phone,

07:17.612 --> 07:18.842
she puts her number in it,

07:18.877 --> 07:20.745
and says,
"You and Jack

07:20.780 --> 07:22.648
"have to go to Sonoma
next weekend

07:22.683 --> 07:24.848
- with Matt and I."
- ♪ Sonoma ♪

07:24.883 --> 07:27.521
Yeah, Cat says
it's the new Napa.

07:29.855 --> 07:31.591
Did you hear
what I just said?

07:31.626 --> 07:34.187
What? Yeah,
no, yeah, it's wild.

07:34.222 --> 07:36.761
Do we not get
the MLB network anymore?

07:36.796 --> 07:38.829
Do you wanna go?

07:38.864 --> 07:40.765
- What?
- Do you wanna go?

07:40.800 --> 07:42.635
- What, to Napa?
- Sonoma?

07:44.837 --> 07:47.233
- Jack.
- Bottom of the third...

07:47.268 --> 07:48.773
I mean, don't you think
that's kind of weird?

07:48.808 --> 07:51.204
Uh, no.
Do not cross-examine.

07:51.239 --> 07:53.844
I'm not, I just--
you don't know this Kate.

07:53.879 --> 07:55.846
- Cat.
- Right, but this person

07:55.881 --> 07:57.276
just, like, blows
into your store, apparently

07:57.311 --> 07:59.080
buys everything in it,
and then you get

07:59.115 --> 08:00.884
a huge commission-- which,
like, you know, awesome.

08:00.919 --> 08:02.314
And then she just
invites you to Sedona?

08:02.349 --> 08:03.590
- Sonoma.
- What did I say?

08:03.625 --> 08:05.185
Sedona.

08:05.220 --> 08:07.022
My point being,
you know, this could be

08:07.057 --> 08:09.024
some weird,
rich person sex thing

08:09.059 --> 08:10.927
- or, like, purge thing.
- "Purge"?

08:10.962 --> 08:12.830
Yeah, like the movies,
like-- like maybe

08:12.865 --> 08:14.326
they wanna hunt us for sport,
did you think about that?

08:14.361 --> 08:16.702
No, I didn't, Jack,
because I'm not an idiot.

08:16.737 --> 08:18.869
Nice, nice, that's good.

08:21.005 --> 08:22.939
I'm sorry.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.914
I would really like to go.

08:33.116 --> 08:35.248
And I would like
to understand why you want

08:35.283 --> 08:37.349
to spend a weekend
with people you don't know.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.725
Okay, because
she was fun

08:39.760 --> 08:41.727
and funny
and interesting,

08:41.762 --> 08:44.697
and she and her husband own
their own businesses.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.226
And they have a house
and they have a family.

08:46.261 --> 08:48.162
They have
their shit together.

08:49.902 --> 08:52.331
I thought this could be
really good for us.

08:55.171 --> 08:56.940
All right, when is it?

08:56.975 --> 08:58.612
- Next weekend.
- Next weekend!

08:58.647 --> 09:00.306
It's next weekend.
You said that, sorry.

09:05.951 --> 09:08.182
Okay.

09:08.217 --> 09:10.316
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:10.351 --> 09:12.824
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I gotta get the time off

09:12.859 --> 09:14.892
and then clear it with Doug.

09:14.927 --> 09:17.763
- But...

09:17.798 --> 09:19.897
- yeah, it'll be fun.
- Yeah?

09:19.932 --> 09:21.800
- I think.
- Yeah?

09:21.835 --> 09:24.033
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

09:24.068 --> 09:25.705
Yeah, yeah.

09:25.740 --> 09:27.102
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:27.137 --> 09:28.741
- I'm gonna text her.
- Great.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.369
- Okay.
- If they purge us, though,

09:30.404 --> 09:32.008
I get to be
super-pissed off.

09:32.043 --> 09:33.405
I mean, it could be
the sex thing.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.648
No.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.382
I knew we should've
printed the directions.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.087
Well, I mean, I didn't know
that there would be

09:45.122 --> 09:47.287
- no service.
- This is what rich people do.

09:47.322 --> 09:48.992
They go off the grid
for vacation.

09:49.027 --> 09:50.829
Because you know
so many rich people?

09:50.864 --> 09:52.391
No, but I do watch
"Billions,"

09:52.426 --> 09:54.899
and this is-- this is
a total Axe move.

09:54.934 --> 09:56.395
Okay.

09:57.772 --> 09:59.739
Where the fuck are we?

09:59.774 --> 10:01.939
- We're in wine country.
- So why are there cows?

10:01.974 --> 10:04.139
There should be grapes.
Read the invite again?

10:04.174 --> 10:06.042
"You are cordially
invited to a weekend

10:06.077 --> 10:08.209
"of wine and whimsy
at Vlas Vineyard.

10:08.244 --> 10:11.080
7766 Lewis Road."

10:11.115 --> 10:12.983
Oh, my God.

10:13.018 --> 10:15.821
And there's a star
and a picture of a cow.

10:15.856 --> 10:17.218
So we are clearly close.

10:28.803 --> 10:30.737
- That's a murder house.
- What?

10:30.772 --> 10:33.168
Yeah. That's a house
where a murder happens.

10:33.203 --> 10:35.335
- What are you talking about?
- My mom always said

10:35.370 --> 10:36.941
you would kill me,
and you've finally done it.

10:36.976 --> 10:39.911
- This is great.
- All right, "Purge."

10:39.946 --> 10:42.309
Look, they're obviously

10:42.344 --> 10:44.344
very, very wealthy.

10:44.379 --> 10:45.884
You're gonna have
to call them.

10:45.919 --> 10:47.413
- I...
- We're just gonna

10:47.448 --> 10:50.053
sit here like weirdos.

10:50.088 --> 10:53.727
Hi! It's Jack and Lindsay!

11:14.442 --> 11:16.178
- No, Jack!
- Hello?

11:16.213 --> 11:17.278
Don't be rude!

11:17.313 --> 11:19.115
Hello?

11:38.367 --> 11:40.301
This man is made of dicks.

11:40.336 --> 11:41.973
- Jack!
- What? He'--

11:42.008 --> 11:43.436
No, I need you
to be cool, okay?

11:43.471 --> 11:45.207
- I am, I am cool.
- No, listen to me.

11:45.242 --> 11:47.308
I really like her,
and she's being really nice

11:47.343 --> 11:49.079
to invite us up here,
and I'm not really great

11:49.114 --> 11:50.542
at making friends,
so I just need you to--

11:50.577 --> 11:52.852
- No, I will keep it tight.
- Tightest.

12:05.328 --> 12:07.130
Okay.

12:11.334 --> 12:13.301
- Oh!

12:13.336 --> 12:15.567
Let's get
the birthday weekend started!

12:15.602 --> 12:17.404
- Let's do it!

12:17.439 --> 12:19.340
- Hey!
- Hi.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.078
- You made it!
- Hi!

12:21.113 --> 12:22.508
Hey, can we get Jack
and Lindsay some drinks?

12:22.543 --> 12:25.115
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:25.150 --> 12:27.282
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

12:27.317 --> 12:29.020
Did you get
the champagne? Great.

12:29.055 --> 12:31.517
I am so grateful
you're here.

12:31.552 --> 12:33.519
I have been losing my mind.

12:33.554 --> 12:35.455
Jack, it is so nice
to finally meet you.

12:35.490 --> 12:37.864
You are so lucky
to have her.

12:37.899 --> 12:40.328
- She's so special.
- Oh, yeah, no, thank you.

12:40.363 --> 12:42.363
- Yeah, of course.
- Jack and Lindz,

12:42.398 --> 12:44.596
these are our friends
Kerry and Carrie.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.840
We know.
It's okay to laugh.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.402
I didn't know his name was
Kerry when we met.

12:48.437 --> 12:50.272
Yeah, she was modeling
at this world wildlife

12:50.307 --> 12:52.472
fundraiser-fashion show-
interactive theater

12:52.507 --> 12:54.111
sort of thing
that Jared was doing.

12:54.146 --> 12:56.080
- Leto, not Kushner.
- Yeah, of course.

12:56.115 --> 12:57.576
That Jared was doing
at Dumbo--

12:57.611 --> 12:59.347
We were all playing
the emotions of penguins

12:59.382 --> 13:01.250
that were killed
for their scales.

13:01.285 --> 13:03.186
Right, right, and the girls
were only allowed to show

13:03.221 --> 13:04.891
- what emotion they were.
- Sad.

13:04.926 --> 13:06.585
Which was super-convincing,
'cause I thought

13:06.620 --> 13:08.257
- her name was--
- Sad.

13:08.292 --> 13:10.127
--for, like, a week.

13:10.162 --> 13:11.623
But, in my defense, I was
pretty fuckin' banged up.

13:11.658 --> 13:15.132
- He spent $65,000

13:15.167 --> 13:16.870
- on champagne.
- Yeah, and then we did

13:16.905 --> 13:18.432
a couple of grams
of Bolivian marching powder

13:18.467 --> 13:20.236
- in the bathroom.
- And we tried to have sex.

13:20.271 --> 13:21.534
In the bathroom.

13:21.569 --> 13:23.008
But he couldn't get hard.

13:23.043 --> 13:24.405
Because of the blow.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.210
- And we've been together

13:27.245 --> 13:29.179
- pretty much ever since.
- Ahh!

13:29.214 --> 13:31.181
Classic Kerry, right, babe?

13:31.216 --> 13:33.018
Can I steal her
for a sec?

13:33.053 --> 13:34.349
Oh, yeah,
by all means.

13:34.384 --> 13:36.021
Great.

13:36.056 --> 13:37.451
I've heard that story
a million times.

13:37.486 --> 13:40.190
- You're welcome.

13:40.225 --> 13:41.961
- My man.
- Yeah.

13:41.996 --> 13:43.523
- Matt Flax.
- Jack Brown.

13:43.558 --> 13:44.997
- Pleasure there, bud.
- Good to meet you.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.262
Nice to meet you too.
Thank you.

13:46.297 --> 13:48.132
Yeah, no, my...
this is...

13:48.167 --> 13:49.661
hey, can I--
do you mind?

13:49.696 --> 13:51.168
Oh, yeah, that's great,
thank you, Becca.

13:51.203 --> 13:52.433
Thank you, Becca.

13:52.468 --> 13:53.940
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:53.975 --> 13:55.370
God, I hate those people.

13:55.405 --> 13:58.373
Really?
They seem nice.

13:58.408 --> 14:00.012
Oh, they're not.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.343
- They're such assholes.
- Really?

14:01.378 --> 14:05.116
Yes.
So, how's Jack doing?

14:05.151 --> 14:06.480
He thinks
we're crazy, right?

14:06.515 --> 14:08.185
What? No.

14:09.650 --> 14:12.288
I mean... he thinks
you're gonna murder us.

14:14.391 --> 14:16.622
I mean,
he's-- he's joking.

14:16.657 --> 14:18.657
Oh, my God, no,
I totally get it.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.395
I'm just, like,
this crazy stranger

14:20.430 --> 14:22.166
who stumbles
into your store

14:22.201 --> 14:23.695
and then invites you
to Healdsburg.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.170
Who does that?

14:26.205 --> 14:28.634
Actually, that would make
a really good horror movie.

14:28.669 --> 14:31.307
Should we write that?

14:31.342 --> 14:33.144
I love that idea.

14:33.179 --> 14:36.180
I'm sorry, I thought
we were in Sonoma.

14:36.215 --> 14:39.216
Oh, we are,
but it's actually Healdsburg,

14:39.251 --> 14:41.449
technically Windsor, but it's
all in the Sonoma region.

14:41.484 --> 14:43.484
Oh, okay.

14:43.519 --> 14:45.618
You know what?
Um, Jack and I were talking,

14:45.653 --> 14:48.027
on the way up,
and we were thinking--

14:48.062 --> 14:51.261
I just felt an immediate
connection to you.

14:51.296 --> 14:54.297
You seem so...

14:54.332 --> 14:56.497
- Sad?

14:56.532 --> 14:58.697
That's a good callback.

14:58.732 --> 15:02.635
No, just... undervalued.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.142
You're not supposed
to be selling

15:04.177 --> 15:06.111
other people's clothes.

15:06.146 --> 15:10.280
Well, I-- I mean,
I don't want to be.

15:10.315 --> 15:12.513
Then why are you?

15:14.583 --> 15:16.385
Student debt.

15:19.093 --> 15:21.258
Oh.

15:21.293 --> 15:22.688
You enjoying the brew?

15:26.199 --> 15:28.067
You-- holy shit, you can't--
you can't get this

15:28.102 --> 15:30.102
- in California.
- Pause.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.269
You buy the distributor,
you can do whatever you want.

15:32.304 --> 15:34.073
- You buy the--

15:34.108 --> 15:36.273
- you bought the distributor?
- Anyway,

15:36.308 --> 15:37.670
let me tell you
a quick story, so that

15:37.705 --> 15:40.277
you don't have to hear it
from Kerry later.

15:40.312 --> 15:42.708
His grandfather
invented tater tots.

15:42.743 --> 15:44.710
- Get the fuck out of here.
- No, it's an epic story.

15:44.745 --> 15:46.481
He was working KP,
kitchen duty, in World War II,

15:46.516 --> 15:48.120
not in the shit,
he was in, like,

15:48.155 --> 15:49.517
Mississippi or something,
and there were

15:49.552 --> 15:51.321
all these little
extra pieces of potato

15:51.356 --> 15:53.125
that they weren't using,
so the guys in the kitchen

15:53.160 --> 15:55.688
started frying 'em up,
and the grunts loved 'em.

15:55.723 --> 15:59.032
So the war ends, and this guy
has got the foresight

15:59.067 --> 16:00.495
to trademark the thing--

16:00.530 --> 16:03.300
the rest of the KP guys
were pissed.

16:03.335 --> 16:04.796
Wait, he didn't cut 'em in?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.732
No, man, the guy was
a fuckin' killer.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.668
- You know?
- Yeah.

16:08.703 --> 16:11.440
Killer. Killer instinct.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.774
- Wow.

16:18.449 --> 16:20.713
Uh, so...
how many more people are

16:20.748 --> 16:22.649
- coming up this weekend?
- Oh, this is it.

16:22.684 --> 16:24.420
Cat wanted to keep it pretty
intimate for her birthday.

16:24.455 --> 16:26.389
And we were gonna
blow it out for 30, so...

16:26.424 --> 16:28.457
she wanted to keep it
simple for 29.

16:28.492 --> 16:31.262
- It's Cat's birthday?
- What-- 69?!

16:31.297 --> 16:33.825
- My guy!
- It's her birthday?

16:33.860 --> 16:35.794
I feel like
I might know the waiter.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.763
- Mm, which one?
- The guy.

16:37.798 --> 16:39.468
Daniel?

16:39.503 --> 16:41.569
- Daniel...
- Yeah.

16:41.604 --> 16:43.802
Huh.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.507
- Uh--
- Do you know him?

16:45.542 --> 16:46.838
- Where are the twins?
- Oh, they're back

16:46.873 --> 16:48.477
with the au pair
in the city.

16:48.512 --> 16:49.709
We wanted to get away
this weekend.

16:49.744 --> 16:51.282
Oh, hell yeah, good for you.

16:51.317 --> 16:52.811
Yeah, it's my birthday.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.351
I didn't want
to think about it.

16:54.386 --> 16:55.715
Them-- they're obvious--

16:55.750 --> 16:57.321
they're people,
I love them.

16:57.356 --> 16:58.718
Did you just say
it was your birthday?

16:58.753 --> 17:01.259
- Yeah.
- Your birthday?!

17:01.294 --> 17:02.689
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

17:02.724 --> 17:04.559
I didn't bring anything!

17:04.594 --> 17:06.495
- Oh, that's okay.
- No, I'm so sorry.

17:06.530 --> 17:10.136
Trust me,
you being here is enough.

17:10.171 --> 17:12.468
I really want you
to let me cook you dinner.

17:12.503 --> 17:14.569
- Oh-- ew, no!
- Please.

17:14.604 --> 17:16.208
- No?
- Ew, no-no-no.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.144
We have--
We have people who do that.

17:18.179 --> 17:19.640
You just be our guest.

17:19.675 --> 17:21.312
Just relax, enjoy.

17:21.347 --> 17:23.215
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:24.515 --> 17:25.778
I'm just happy
you're here.

17:25.813 --> 17:27.681
- Mmm.
- Hey.

17:27.716 --> 17:29.782
Hi.

17:29.817 --> 17:31.289
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:31.324 --> 17:33.126
You know-- hi,
I think

17:33.161 --> 17:34.655
Lindsay and I would love
to take a moment

17:34.690 --> 17:36.393
to just go check out
our room real quick.

17:36.428 --> 17:39.198
- Just get situated.
- Oh...

17:39.233 --> 17:41.167
yeah, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

17:41.202 --> 17:44.434
I-- I forget that being
up here makes people...

17:44.469 --> 17:46.238
- Oh--
- Oh, no-no-no--

17:46.273 --> 17:48.240
You two go unload.

17:48.275 --> 17:51.210
Wink-wink, sorry,
I'm-- I'm so inappropriate.

17:51.245 --> 17:53.673
Sometimes
I have to-- Becca!

17:57.746 --> 17:59.482
Could you please show
our guests to their room?

17:59.517 --> 18:00.813
- Hi.
- Of course.

18:00.848 --> 18:02.650
We took the liberty
of putting

18:02.685 --> 18:04.817
- your bags in your room.
- I'm just gonna assume

18:04.852 --> 18:06.687
it's that one there at the end
of the hallway, right?

18:06.722 --> 18:08.392
So I think we can probably
get there on our own.

18:08.427 --> 18:10.491
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:14.565 --> 18:16.565
Holy shit,
this is a guest room?

18:19.438 --> 18:21.504
He bought
my favorite brewery.

18:21.539 --> 18:23.638
- What?
- He bought...

18:23.673 --> 18:25.508
well, he bought
the distribution--

18:25.543 --> 18:27.378
how did he know
that's my favorite beer?

18:27.413 --> 18:29.281
Oh, I mean, I don't know,
he probably, like,

18:29.316 --> 18:30.810
Instagrammed you
or Facebooked you,

18:30.845 --> 18:32.713
- or whatever.
- So he stalked me?

18:32.748 --> 18:34.715
No, he Googled you.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.453
We all do it.
We all Google each other,

18:36.488 --> 18:38.191
and then we act surprised
when people tell us shit

18:38.226 --> 18:39.951
that we already know
about ourselves.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.590
Did you know
it was her birthday?

18:41.625 --> 18:44.329
- Mm...
- That's kind of weird

18:44.364 --> 18:45.825
she wouldn't tell us
that we were up here

18:45.860 --> 18:47.332
- for her birthday.
- Well, I think that--

18:47.367 --> 18:49.532
Where are our bags?

18:49.567 --> 18:51.963
Um...

18:51.998 --> 18:54.801
they're in here,
in a closet.

18:54.836 --> 18:56.968
- Jesus.
- They're unpacked.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.245
They are definitely
gonna kill us.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.347
Hey,
what are these?

19:03.515 --> 19:04.778
I don't know.

19:06.881 --> 19:09.354
Gift bags!

19:09.389 --> 19:11.521
Oh, my God!

19:13.360 --> 19:16.526
- Jesus.
- Jack, these are so nice!

19:16.561 --> 19:18.627
I've got facewash...

19:18.662 --> 19:21.300
- Hangover kit...
- Beard trim lotion...

19:21.335 --> 19:23.896
- Massage oil...
- I have lube...

19:23.931 --> 19:25.634
- Really?
- Yes, there's, like,

19:25.669 --> 19:27.240
a tremendous amount
of sex stuff in here.

19:27.275 --> 19:30.001
- Oh, my God.
- And I have Viagra.

19:31.807 --> 19:33.708
I told you
it was a sex thing.

19:33.743 --> 19:36.381
- Yes, yes, you did.

19:36.416 --> 19:37.745
Gum...

19:39.650 --> 19:41.320
Hey.

19:42.422 --> 19:44.488
Can-- Can we not do
any drugs this weekend?

19:44.523 --> 19:45.918
- Who's doing drugs?
- I mean, the first thing

19:45.953 --> 19:47.392
- that guy said was--
- Which guy?

19:47.427 --> 19:48.789
Kerry, the tall guy.

19:48.824 --> 19:49.988
He said
he does a lot of blow.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.693
- Okay?
- And there are

19:51.728 --> 19:53.662
joints in my bag.

19:53.697 --> 19:56.027
- Which are totally legal.
- They are, for people

19:56.062 --> 19:57.732
that aren't on probation
and have to piss

19:57.767 --> 19:59.338
- in a cup every week.
- Well, I mean...

19:59.373 --> 20:00.900
well, that's not
their fault.

20:03.707 --> 20:05.410
Okay.

20:10.714 --> 20:12.483
There are six people here.

20:12.518 --> 20:14.419
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm,

20:14.454 --> 20:17.422
- and there's an itinerary.
- Wine tasting, karaoke,

20:17.457 --> 20:20.821
brunch, yoga,
massages!

20:20.856 --> 20:22.856
Jack, this is like a resort.

20:22.891 --> 20:24.759
"Jumpin' Jack Flash."

20:24.794 --> 20:27.564
What?
That's so rad.

20:29.029 --> 20:30.864
What's mine say?

20:30.899 --> 20:33.306
"Lazy Lindz."

20:33.341 --> 20:35.968
Oh, well...

20:36.003 --> 20:38.311
You still hate when people
call you "Lindz," right?

20:38.346 --> 20:39.675
- Oh, yeah.
- They...

20:39.710 --> 20:41.578
- Don't know that.
- Right.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.914
You wanna...

20:47.949 --> 20:49.784
unload?

20:51.018 --> 20:52.523
Now?

20:54.857 --> 20:57.462
You don't really seem
like you want to.

20:58.861 --> 21:01.334
- Yeah, I don't.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.510
Fuck, I should've changed.

21:12.545 --> 21:13.973
- No, you look fine.
- I look fucking homeless.

21:14.008 --> 21:15.711
- You look fine.
- Jack, Lindz,

21:15.746 --> 21:17.647
- you guys get situated?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:17.682 --> 21:19.583
Somebody unpacked our stuff.

21:19.618 --> 21:21.354
Oh, yeah,
that was Milton.

21:21.389 --> 21:22.883
He is the fucking best.

21:22.918 --> 21:25.116
- Milton?
- Well,

21:25.151 --> 21:27.052
I say Milton,
I mean Daniel and Becca.

21:27.087 --> 21:29.428
- But yeah.
- Okay, you know,

21:29.463 --> 21:30.990
by the way, thank you
for the bags.

21:31.025 --> 21:32.794
- They're incredible.
- Oh, did we do bags?

21:32.829 --> 21:34.367
Hey, babe,
what's in the bags?

21:34.402 --> 21:35.995
I don't know,
I told Milton to do

21:36.030 --> 21:37.469
the kits again and then
just to do something

21:37.504 --> 21:40.901
- comfy but fun.
- Guys, seriously.

21:40.936 --> 21:43.475
Are they comfy but fun?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.478
- Very.
- Great.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.381
Hey, I was--
I'm still not getting

21:48.416 --> 21:49.745
any cell phone reception.

21:49.780 --> 21:51.516
- Yeah, and you won't.
- What?

21:51.551 --> 21:52.979
No internet either.

21:53.014 --> 21:54.585
Only way I can
keep him off the grid.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.554
She calls it a digital detox.

21:56.589 --> 21:58.149
We just get to be
here, together,

21:58.184 --> 21:59.986
without any interruptions.

22:00.021 --> 22:02.890
Wow, that's... that's crazy.

22:02.925 --> 22:05.860
So, what are we doing
for dinner?

22:05.895 --> 22:08.566
I'm-- I'm happy
to help in the kitchen

22:08.601 --> 22:10.568
- with the vegan--
- Oh, no-no-no.

22:10.603 --> 22:12.097
Come here, I wanna show you
something, Ker, come here.

22:12.132 --> 22:13.604
You boys go away,
I want Lindz to myself.

22:13.639 --> 22:14.836
- Okay.
- Come here.

22:14.871 --> 22:16.937
You have fun.

22:16.972 --> 22:18.708
- Jack?
- Yeah.

22:18.743 --> 22:20.413
What are you drinking?

22:20.448 --> 22:21.975
Just whatever you got
there is perfect.

22:22.010 --> 22:23.746
- Thank you.
- Tequila.

22:23.781 --> 22:26.716
- Oh.
- Bing.

22:26.751 --> 22:28.751
Bang.

22:28.786 --> 22:31.182
- Bong.
- Boom.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.525
- Cheers.
- Cheers, yes, thanks, guys.

22:36.761 --> 22:39.432
- Fuck me, that's good.
- Right? Yeah?

22:39.467 --> 22:40.961
What-- is this--
is this Casa? What is this?

22:40.996 --> 22:42.930
It's from me and Matt's
place in Jalisco.

22:42.965 --> 22:44.932
- Jalisco?
- Yeah,

22:44.967 --> 22:47.407
the tequila capital
of the world, Jack.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.575
- Is this your tequila?
- Well, mine and Ker's,

22:50.610 --> 22:53.006
- but yeah.
- Oh, my God, that is cool.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.711
Yeah, we don't
sell it, though.

22:54.746 --> 22:56.548
Yeah, it's just
for personal consumption.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.110
Mm-hmm, do you love it?
Or do you love it?

22:58.145 --> 22:59.485
- You love it.
- Kerry?

22:59.520 --> 23:00.849
- Yes?
- I fucking love

23:00.884 --> 23:02.719
- this tequila.
- I knew it.

23:02.754 --> 23:04.985
We'll have--
we'll send you a case, huh?

23:05.020 --> 23:06.822
Thank you, man, that's
really-- that's really sweet.

23:06.857 --> 23:08.186
Thank you. That's really
nice of you guys.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.957
Of course.
Hey, come on.

23:09.992 --> 23:11.596
- I wanna show you the view.
- Yeah-yeah-yeah.

23:11.631 --> 23:13.730
Hey, actually, you gotta
finish your drink.

23:13.765 --> 23:16.964
No man refills
till every man is refueled.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.230
- It's a house rule.
- I told my wife I wasn't

23:19.265 --> 23:20.968
gonna drink too much,
so I'm probably just gonna,

23:21.003 --> 23:22.574
like, I'll just sip it
a little bit, maybe,

23:22.609 --> 23:23.839
like a water in there,
maybe a juice--

23:23.874 --> 23:25.038
How are you gonna
drink too much?

23:25.073 --> 23:26.545
We're not going anywhere.

23:26.580 --> 23:28.514
- I-I...

23:28.549 --> 23:29.911
- Bottoms up!
- Okay, okay.

23:31.948 --> 23:34.212
- I'm too-- let's go.
- It's really nice, though.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.148
It's kind of oaky.

23:36.183 --> 23:37.820
Becca had our chef
prep everything

23:37.855 --> 23:39.855
and then run it up here
this morning.

23:39.890 --> 23:41.186
Don't tell anyone.

23:41.221 --> 23:43.529
- No.
- Wine?

23:43.564 --> 23:45.223
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.566
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

23:47.601 --> 23:48.963
You're welcome.

23:48.998 --> 23:50.602
These are beautiful glasses.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.769
Oh, thank you.

23:52.804 --> 23:54.804
Yeah, they're kind of
one of a kind.

23:56.808 --> 24:00.777
Um... whoo.

24:04.783 --> 24:06.750
Okay, and...

24:06.785 --> 24:09.786
here you go...

24:09.821 --> 24:13.757
Ooh, sorry,
it's just about out, so.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.627
- That's fine.
- Awesome, okay.

24:19.259 --> 24:21.963
Um...

24:21.998 --> 24:24.262
I mean, I can't even imagine
having to do another trip

24:24.297 --> 24:26.033
with just the four of us.

24:26.068 --> 24:27.705
I mean, the boys are
inseparable.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.608
And then it's just me and...

24:31.777 --> 24:33.304
- I mean,

24:33.339 --> 24:35.812
I just get drunk.
There's nothing else to do.

24:35.847 --> 24:37.847
- Well, cheers.
- Thank you, God...

24:37.882 --> 24:39.882
It's the fucking best, right?

24:46.253 --> 24:47.857
I can't believe
you're here, Jack.

24:47.892 --> 24:49.694
I can't believe it
either, man.

24:49.729 --> 24:51.124
Oh, no-no, no,
you misunderstand me.

24:51.159 --> 24:54.061
Cat doesn't like people.

24:54.096 --> 24:57.801
Not certain people.
People. I thought

24:57.836 --> 24:59.869
she was joking when she said
she invited you up here.

24:59.904 --> 25:02.267
Honestly, dude, I--
I thought Lindsay was--

25:02.302 --> 25:04.005
like, I still--
I still think this is a joke.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.644
I'm, like, waiting
for fucking Ashton Kutcher

25:05.679 --> 25:07.712
to pop out of the couch
or something.

25:07.747 --> 25:10.715
- Dude, is Ashton coming?
- He's just joking, Kerry.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.585
Wait, you guys know
Ashton Kutcher?

25:12.620 --> 25:14.015
- Fuck, we used to--
- They had a big--

25:14.050 --> 25:15.951
- It doesn't matter.
- --thing.

25:15.986 --> 25:17.623
What, were you guys, like,
the house rules thing--

25:17.658 --> 25:19.317
- were you guys in a frat--
- No, we went

25:19.352 --> 25:21.660
- to a prep school together.
- Yeah, go, Cavs, whoo!

25:21.695 --> 25:24.322
And I was a first-gen,
and Kerry was not

25:24.357 --> 25:27.061
an old-money dickbag
like the rest of those guys.

25:27.096 --> 25:29.162
So you got a lot of these guys
coming to these schools

25:29.197 --> 25:30.966
who are, like,
deep old money.

25:31.001 --> 25:32.869
Like, fucked up
industrial revolution money.

25:32.904 --> 25:34.706
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.103
Matt was one of the first
hedge fund guy's kids

25:36.138 --> 25:37.643
- to roll through.
- Mm.

25:37.678 --> 25:39.139
Your dad was
a hedge fund guy?

25:39.174 --> 25:41.944
Yeah, yeah, he was.

25:41.979 --> 25:44.144
And then he was
an insider trading guy.

25:44.179 --> 25:46.212
- And then he was a jail guy.
- Whoa.

25:46.247 --> 25:48.621
And we lost everything,
and my mother had to...

25:48.656 --> 25:51.019
go back to waiting tables
at age 45

25:51.054 --> 25:53.021
at a shitty restaurant,

25:53.056 --> 25:54.891
and I had to drop out
of school and take a job

25:54.926 --> 25:57.355
bagging groceries,
and then kind of

25:57.390 --> 26:00.160
the cherry
on top of it all...

26:00.195 --> 26:02.228
my dad killed himself
when he was in prison.

26:02.263 --> 26:04.296
Oh, Jesus Christ,
man, I'm sorry.

26:04.331 --> 26:06.001
And it kind of
ruined my mom, and...

26:06.036 --> 26:08.267
she couldn't work
anymore, and...

26:08.302 --> 26:10.137
so I decided
to start working nights

26:10.172 --> 26:13.305
at Blockbuster, and...
when I was there,

26:13.340 --> 26:16.913
I pretty quickly identified
that their whole market share

26:16.948 --> 26:19.179
was just gonna crumble
with the way that the internet

26:19.214 --> 26:20.719
was gonna be going
with streaming services.

26:20.754 --> 26:22.721
- You were how old?
- Oh, was...

26:22.756 --> 26:24.118
- Seventeen.
- Yeah, 17,

26:24.153 --> 26:25.383
but it wasn't
rocket science, right?

26:25.418 --> 26:27.055
Everybody had
big screen TVs,

26:27.090 --> 26:28.925
because the Korean tech
finally caught up

26:28.960 --> 26:31.796
to the need or want
of Japanese TVs.

26:31.831 --> 26:33.831
Thanks to an investment
from my guy here

26:33.866 --> 26:35.360
and some money
over at Netflix,

26:35.395 --> 26:38.330
and a few other
well-placed investments...

26:38.365 --> 26:40.937
here we are.

26:40.972 --> 26:43.335
You did this by yourself?

26:43.370 --> 26:45.777
What? No.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.680
Did you listen
to anything I just said?

26:47.715 --> 26:50.408
My life is a Rube Goldberg
machine of privilege.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.685
It was, like...

26:52.720 --> 26:55.985
...boarding school, bing,
university, boom,

26:56.020 --> 26:58.218
investment,
no, man, come on.

26:58.253 --> 27:00.693
No, you don't-- you don't
get this by yourself.

27:00.728 --> 27:02.420
You-- You get this
with a little bit of capital

27:02.455 --> 27:04.829
and a fuckton of luck.

27:06.096 --> 27:08.129
- Hey, to luck.
- To luck.

27:08.164 --> 27:09.361
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:12.366 --> 27:15.235
It is so nice to have
another adult to talk to.

27:15.270 --> 27:17.270
I mean, Kerry just runs
through these girls.

27:17.305 --> 27:20.009
This one's clearly nearing
her expiration date.

27:20.044 --> 27:22.209
And they've obviously
stopped fucking, right?

27:22.244 --> 27:24.409
How-- How can you tell?

27:24.444 --> 27:26.752
Stop!

27:26.787 --> 27:29.018
"How can you tell?"

27:29.053 --> 27:30.723
Ugh, you're hilarious.

27:30.758 --> 27:32.219
Do you ever do stand-up?

27:32.254 --> 27:34.485
- No.
- Really? You should.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.256
You could be, like,
Sarah Silverman's

27:36.291 --> 27:37.961
- little sister.

27:37.996 --> 27:40.293
Oh! Time to rotate
the mung bean balls.

27:40.328 --> 27:43.362
- Becca!
- Thank you, Becca.

27:43.397 --> 27:44.902
You're so cute.

27:46.301 --> 27:48.103
No, no, no!

27:51.878 --> 27:53.438
So, what business are
you in, Jack?

27:53.473 --> 27:56.474
Oh, I'm a-- it's boring,
it's renewable energy.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.784
Oh, dope!
Dope, so, like,

27:58.819 --> 28:01.182
- design or infrastructure?
- No, it's again, it's solar.

28:01.217 --> 28:03.481
- It's not--
- Oh, beta, okay, all right.

28:03.516 --> 28:06.055
So, are you enjoying
that Tesla tax write-off then?

28:06.090 --> 28:08.420
I, uh...

28:10.325 --> 28:12.424
I sell them.

28:12.459 --> 28:15.427
The solar panels.
I go-- I go door to door,

28:15.462 --> 28:17.264
and I try
to sell them to people.

28:17.299 --> 28:20.366
Jack is being bashful.
He was a lawyer.

28:20.401 --> 28:22.236
- Oh, sick!
- Yeah, but then

28:22.271 --> 28:23.908
he got hit
with an assault charge.

28:23.943 --> 28:25.877
- Oh, misdemeanor felony.
- Was a felony,

28:25.912 --> 28:27.505
but he got it kicked
down to a misdemeanor,

28:27.540 --> 28:30.409
and now he's serving probation
for... three years?

28:30.444 --> 28:32.477
Five...

28:34.250 --> 28:35.447
how do you know that?

28:37.022 --> 28:39.220
Got a guy at the FBI.

28:39.255 --> 28:41.222
And he feeds me information
whenever I have anybody

28:41.257 --> 28:43.521
over to the house.
It's stupid,

28:43.556 --> 28:45.523
but it's--
it's all about safety.

28:49.100 --> 28:52.134
Oh, my God,
you should see your face.

28:52.169 --> 28:53.905
Come on!

28:53.940 --> 28:56.204
Oh, my God,
no, man, that was...

28:56.239 --> 28:58.811
that... that was good,

28:58.846 --> 29:00.813
no, your wife told
my wife, man.

29:00.848 --> 29:02.309
She-- She told Cat that?

29:02.344 --> 29:03.882
Yeah, man,
that's just what they do,

29:03.917 --> 29:05.246
they get alone,
and they just--

29:05.281 --> 29:06.544
--take us down a peg.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.150
- So what happened?
- I...

29:10.253 --> 29:11.582
I have anger
management issues.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.353
Oh, cool, me too!

29:13.388 --> 29:15.190
Oh, so that's
why you're in therapy.

29:15.225 --> 29:16.994
- Got it, got it, got it...
- Lindsay...

29:17.029 --> 29:18.930
Lindsay told Cat that?

29:18.965 --> 29:20.932
Oh, no, that was
Milton's guy at the FBI.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.198
- He told us that.

29:30.878 --> 29:32.570
So, it's weird
you know that, man.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.341
- What?
- You know, the therapy,

29:34.376 --> 29:36.310
- that's...
- Dude,

29:36.345 --> 29:37.883
I fuckin' love therapy,
what are you talking about?

29:37.918 --> 29:40.083
No, it's great, just I...

29:40.118 --> 29:42.217
you just, you know,
like, a lot about me,

29:42.252 --> 29:43.581
and I don't really know
anything about you.

29:43.616 --> 29:46.221
Well, if we're
keeping track, my man,

29:46.256 --> 29:47.959
you know that
my father went to prison

29:47.994 --> 29:49.356
- and that he killed himself.
- I...

29:49.391 --> 29:51.259
Hey, that was
a super-vulnerable thing

29:51.294 --> 29:52.931
to tell a stranger.

29:52.966 --> 29:54.460
- Thanks, bud.
- You're welcome, bro.

29:54.495 --> 29:56.462
Yeah, okay, so, um,

29:56.497 --> 29:58.431
- Lindsay--
- Who?

29:58.466 --> 30:00.070
- My wife.
- Lindz.

30:00.105 --> 30:02.006
- Yeah, Lindz.
- Oh.

30:02.041 --> 30:05.438
Lindz, Lindz got into
an argument with this guy

30:05.473 --> 30:08.342
- in a bar, and--
- So you hit him.

30:08.377 --> 30:10.883
No, I mean,
it's not that simple.

30:10.918 --> 30:12.115
- But you hit the guy.
- Yeah, but--

30:12.150 --> 30:13.083
- So it is--
- What?

30:13.118 --> 30:14.150
That simple.

30:14.185 --> 30:15.448
No, I mean, you know,

30:15.483 --> 30:17.384
this fucking guy...

30:17.419 --> 30:19.551
this fucking asshole,
you know, he's fucking--

30:19.586 --> 30:21.256
he's getting into it with
my wife, and the fucking...

30:21.291 --> 30:23.291
he calls her a fucking--
cunt.

30:23.326 --> 30:26.162
- A wh-- a what?
- Cunt.

30:26.197 --> 30:28.032
- Cuh-- what is he saying?
- I don't have any idea.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.561
- A cunt.
- Oh.

30:29.596 --> 30:31.365
And this fucking asshole
calls my wife--

30:31.400 --> 30:33.268
- Lindz.
- Yes, Lindz, Lindz,

30:33.303 --> 30:34.665
a fucking cunt, you know,
so I fucking--

30:34.700 --> 30:36.942
I get really
in the guy's face,

30:36.977 --> 30:38.504
he fucking shoves me, and I--
I just-- I fucking hit him,

30:38.539 --> 30:40.242
man, I just fucking hit him
across his fucking face.

30:40.277 --> 30:42.145
- Yeah, fuck yeah, dude.
- Fuck yeah.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.916
And this motherfucker,
he ends up being

30:43.951 --> 30:45.346
the fucking son of
a prominent state senator,

30:45.381 --> 30:48.987
- and I'm fucking...
- Oh, fuck.

30:49.022 --> 30:50.956
Jackie.

30:53.026 --> 30:54.652
That's...

30:54.687 --> 30:56.291
that's a hell
of a break, man.

30:58.493 --> 31:00.999
Sometimes you don't
have any capital,

31:01.034 --> 31:03.133
and you're really
fucking unlucky,

31:03.168 --> 31:05.564
and you end up disbarred,
on probation,

31:05.599 --> 31:08.402
selling fucking solar panels
door-to-door, so.

31:08.437 --> 31:10.976
- Yeah.
- Hey, here's

31:11.011 --> 31:12.340
to bad luck too, right,
'cause what's the fucking good

31:12.375 --> 31:13.638
without the bad, yeah?

31:13.673 --> 31:15.277
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:15.312 --> 31:17.213
- To Jack. Oh.
- And...

31:17.248 --> 31:19.215
and for what it's worth,

31:19.250 --> 31:21.019
I'd hit the guy too.

31:21.054 --> 31:23.351
- To Jack.
- Thanks.

31:23.386 --> 31:25.716
Let's get
some mung bean bowls.

31:25.751 --> 31:28.026
Then we can all go throw up,
it'll be great.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.263
Who's ready
for karaoke?!

- Whoo! Gotta do it again.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.218
No, I did not keep it tight.

My son made that one,

Here we go.
Yeah, okay, that's good.

32:44.071 --> 32:46.797
- Thank you.
- Okay.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.767
- What are you gonna do?
- Um, I'm going to go to bed.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.770
What? No, go have fun.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.608
- Really?
- Um, yeah.

32:55.643 --> 32:57.676
You're having fun, right?

32:57.711 --> 32:59.645
I mean, yeah,
I'm having a lot of fun.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.285
- Good.
- Okay.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.056
- Okay.
- All right.

33:04.091 --> 33:05.816
- Mm.
- Mm.

33:05.851 --> 33:09.490
- ...Matt.
- Good night.

33:09.525 --> 33:12.130
- What?
- Matt, he said--

33:12.165 --> 33:15.067
guy is so smart,
so smart.

33:15.102 --> 33:17.399
He was talking
Korean technology,

33:17.434 --> 33:20.303
Japanese green energy, money.

33:20.338 --> 33:22.536
He's the best.

33:22.571 --> 33:27.079
He's really smart--
Jack, you should talk to him.

33:27.114 --> 33:29.246
You should talk to him over
the weekend about business.

33:29.281 --> 33:31.182
I mean, maybe he could
help you find a job.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.316
Nah, I have a job.

33:33.351 --> 33:36.154
I just-- I meant maybe
something that you liked

33:36.189 --> 33:38.156
because you don't
love your job.

33:38.191 --> 33:41.522
And maybe there could be
something there

33:41.557 --> 33:43.359
like a different career
or something.

33:47.167 --> 33:48.859
Okay, good night.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.334
Good night,
there's water by the bed.

33:59.146 --> 34:02.444
Uh, hi, um,
can I get a tequila?

34:02.479 --> 34:05.579
- Lindsay.
- Um, Daniel, right?

34:06.912 --> 34:09.418
Lindsay.

34:09.453 --> 34:11.354
You don't recognize me?

34:11.389 --> 34:13.257
Dan.

34:13.292 --> 34:15.226
Dan Bishop.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.327
- Lindsay Simpson.

34:17.362 --> 34:19.230
- Holy shit.
- I know.

34:19.265 --> 34:21.694
- Oh, my God.

34:21.729 --> 34:23.696
What are you doing here?

34:23.731 --> 34:25.797
Uh, I work
for the Flaxes.

34:25.832 --> 34:27.601
Well, I work for Milton.

34:27.636 --> 34:29.504
But yeah,

34:29.539 --> 34:31.671
Oh, my God,
that-- I mean,

34:31.706 --> 34:35.147
Wow, you--
you look so different.

34:35.182 --> 34:37.908
I know, well,
I was a trainer at SeaWorld,

34:37.943 --> 34:39.811
and I quit that
when it stopped being cool

34:39.846 --> 34:42.484
and, you know, started
fighting the fires up here,

34:42.519 --> 34:44.618
and went to Burning Man,
met these folks--

34:44.653 --> 34:45.751
- it was like--
- Oh, my God!

34:45.786 --> 34:47.291
It all fell into line.

34:47.326 --> 34:50.327
That is truly wild.

34:50.362 --> 34:52.494
Um, I just--
thank you.

34:52.529 --> 34:56.366
- Um, so...
- And, uh, your husband,

34:56.401 --> 34:59.501
- he was, what--
- He's a lawyer.

34:59.536 --> 35:01.470
- He's a lawyer.
- He is?

35:01.505 --> 35:03.307
And I work in fashion.

35:03.342 --> 35:05.177
- What? That's amazing.
- Yeah.

35:05.212 --> 35:07.344
Thank you, um, can I--

35:07.379 --> 35:09.181
- can I get just a little--
- Lindsay Simpson.

35:09.216 --> 35:11.249
--just a refill,
my song's about to come up.

35:11.284 --> 35:12.877
- So I gotta--
- Well, let's get you

35:12.912 --> 35:15.451
- warmed up, girl.
- I gotta go, but you,

35:15.486 --> 35:17.816
you look great,
it's so good to see you.

35:17.851 --> 35:19.653
I'll see you.
We'll be seeing you.

35:19.688 --> 35:21.787
Yeah, I'll be here
all weekend, don't worry.

35:28.565 --> 35:31.434
Hi...ya.

35:31.469 --> 35:33.304
I was hoping
you would come back.

35:33.339 --> 35:34.800
Oh, my God.

35:34.835 --> 35:36.736
- Is Jack okay?
- Jack is fine.

35:36.771 --> 35:38.408
He didn't throw up
or anything? Does he need--

35:38.443 --> 35:40.212
No, no-no-no,
he's sleeping, um,

35:40.247 --> 35:41.642
do you remember earlier,
when I said that I thought

35:41.677 --> 35:43.644
- I recognized the waiter?
- Oh, Daniel.

35:43.679 --> 35:44.645
- Yeah, Dan.
- Daniel.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.383
Dan, Dan Bishop.

35:46.418 --> 35:47.483
I went to high school
with Dan.

35:47.518 --> 35:49.221
Daniel Bishop.
Shut up.

35:49.256 --> 35:51.487
- Yeah, no, I went--
- What are the odds?

35:51.522 --> 35:54.556
The odds that I, uh,
would be a person

35:54.591 --> 35:56.822
who had a lot of sex
with someone

35:56.857 --> 35:58.494
- who works at her house?
- You did sex--

35:58.529 --> 35:59.924
Are very small!

35:59.959 --> 36:01.266
- Wow!
- Yeah.

36:02.599 --> 36:04.269
That is so hot.

36:04.304 --> 36:06.568
Well...

36:06.603 --> 36:08.834
That's not all.

36:08.869 --> 36:10.638
Dan had a nickname.

36:10.673 --> 36:12.937
- What was his nickname?
- Big Dick Dan.

36:12.972 --> 36:15.511
- Big Dick Dan?
- Dan has a massive dick.

36:15.546 --> 36:16.743
- Yes!

36:16.778 --> 36:18.646
- I love that.
- Okay.

36:18.681 --> 36:20.483
- I love that so much.
- Well, yeah.

36:20.518 --> 36:22.320
- Oh, my gosh.
- It would be so fun

36:22.355 --> 36:24.421
and such a fun story

36:24.456 --> 36:26.016
if it wasn't for the fact that
all of my sorority sisters

36:26.051 --> 36:27.787
knew about it--
when I started dating Jack,

36:27.822 --> 36:29.393
they would tease him.

36:29.428 --> 36:30.691
Does Jack not have
a big dick?

36:30.726 --> 36:32.528
No, Jack has a great dick.

36:32.563 --> 36:34.299
He has a great dick,
it's just like,

36:34.334 --> 36:35.597
it's like husband dick,
like he's my husband.

36:35.632 --> 36:37.335
- You know?
- Yeah, I do know.

36:37.370 --> 36:38.930
- Unfortunately.
- He's been pretty cool

36:38.965 --> 36:40.932
about it,
it's just that...

36:40.967 --> 36:43.374
I-- I don't know
how he's gonna react.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.673
- Mmm.
- It's an old wound.

36:45.708 --> 36:47.411
- You know what I mean?
- Why does it-- Why does it

36:47.446 --> 36:48.973
need to be a thing?

36:49.008 --> 36:50.612
Well, because I'm gonna be

36:50.647 --> 36:52.009
a terrible person
if I don't tell him.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.846
You don't have
to tell him shit.

36:53.881 --> 36:55.683
- What?
- Why do you have

36:55.718 --> 36:57.718
to tell him that?
You could just not tell him.

36:57.753 --> 37:00.424
In what world do I just
ignore Big Dick Dan

37:00.459 --> 37:02.657
- for the rest of the week?
- I don't want you to.

37:02.692 --> 37:04.560
But maybe you kind of have to.

37:04.595 --> 37:06.496
Or I could just fire him.

37:06.531 --> 37:07.926
- Because then--
- What?!

37:07.961 --> 37:09.631
you don't have
to think about it,

37:09.666 --> 37:11.402
Jack doesn't have to get
upset, and then we can--

37:11.437 --> 37:13.305
- Are you messing with me?
- Daniel!

37:13.340 --> 37:15.340
- No! Cat, seriously.
- I feel like you--

37:15.375 --> 37:17.309
No, tequila's great!
Thank you!

37:17.344 --> 37:19.003
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry, I just

37:19.038 --> 37:20.741
want you to have
a good time, okay?

37:20.776 --> 37:22.380
- Okay, so then--
- Okay.

37:22.415 --> 37:24.008
--maybe for tonight
we can just...

37:24.043 --> 37:27.616
- forget about it?
- Hey, can you keep a secret?

37:27.651 --> 37:30.916
- Yeah.
- Keep it a secret.

37:58.946 --> 38:00.814
Fuck...

38:00.849 --> 38:02.046
Oh...

38:03.885 --> 38:05.852
Oh, my...

38:12.894 --> 38:15.026
Oh, fuck.

38:15.061 --> 38:17.061
Oh.

38:17.096 --> 38:19.503
Babe, this doesn't
even have to be an argument.

38:19.538 --> 38:22.473
I can take the plane
and be back in time from Dubai

38:22.508 --> 38:24.101
to see his art installation.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.004
Except
I don't believe you.

38:26.039 --> 38:27.874
You're not gonna make it
back at time, and then I--

38:27.909 --> 38:29.876
Why does he wear so much
eyeliner to those things?

38:29.911 --> 38:32.450
Because it's part
of his look.

38:32.485 --> 38:34.111
He's establishing himself
as an artist.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.113
Well, I don't wanna
raise a weird kid

38:36.148 --> 38:37.653
who dresses in black
all the time.

38:37.688 --> 38:39.116
If he's weird,
then he's gonna be--

38:39.151 --> 38:41.723
Jack, hey, morning!
You sleep okay?

38:41.758 --> 38:44.429
- Hi, is Lindz up?
- Uh, no, no.

38:44.464 --> 38:46.563
She, um...

38:46.598 --> 38:48.796
I'm-- I am like--

38:48.831 --> 38:51.029
uh, we-we-we... we got
after it last night, huh?

38:51.064 --> 38:53.130
You definitely took it
up a notch, my man,

38:53.165 --> 38:55.407
but hey, when you work hard,
you get to play hard.

38:55.442 --> 38:57.541
Am I right?

38:57.576 --> 38:59.070
You going for a run?

38:59.105 --> 39:00.841
Yeah, yeah, no,
I'm gonna, you know,

39:00.876 --> 39:03.646
try to sweat it out
before I put it back in.

39:03.681 --> 39:05.516
Detox, retox,
circle of life.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.078
- You should use the gym.
- The gym?

39:07.113 --> 39:08.651
There's one downstairs
and then another one

39:08.686 --> 39:10.147
- down below by the pool.
- The pool?

39:10.182 --> 39:12.083
Yeah, the one downstairs
is kind of sterile.

39:12.118 --> 39:13.887
Agreed, I prefer
the one at the guest house.

39:13.922 --> 39:15.691
- The guest house?
- Also, Kerry's

39:15.726 --> 39:17.825
in the gym downstairs,
and he is a lot in there.

39:17.860 --> 39:19.926
- At the guest house.
- No, downstairs.

39:19.961 --> 39:21.092
But I think
Carrie's at the sauna.

39:21.127 --> 39:22.599
- Oh.
- Where?

39:22.634 --> 39:23.996
- By the pool.
- Which is?

39:24.031 --> 39:25.899
- Down below.
- Down below.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.968
Great.

39:30.972 --> 39:33.940
There it is.

39:33.975 --> 39:36.745
- Have fun.
- Sweat it out.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.978
- He's gonna get lost.
- Yeah.

39:39.013 --> 39:42.718
Hah! Hah!

39:42.753 --> 39:45.017
Hah!

39:45.052 --> 39:48.460
Hah! Hah!
Hey, buddy!

39:48.495 --> 39:50.055
Hah!

39:50.090 --> 39:53.157
I miss you, Daddy!
I miss you, Daddy!

39:53.192 --> 39:54.829
I hate you,
Daddy!

40:25.928 --> 40:27.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:27.732 --> 40:29.160
- How you doing?
- I'm good, brother.

40:29.195 --> 40:31.162
Just enjoying the bounty
of a beautiful day.

40:31.197 --> 40:33.703
- Right on.
- Hey, you're Jack, right?

40:33.738 --> 40:35.969
- Lindsay's husband.
- Yeah, yeah, man, you guys--

40:36.004 --> 40:37.806
Man, it is great
to meet you.

40:37.841 --> 40:40.006
Yeah, you guys...

40:40.041 --> 40:41.810
you guys too,
I'm looking for the...

40:41.845 --> 40:44.109
- the guest house?
- Which one?

40:44.144 --> 40:47.178
The... The one
with the pool?

40:47.213 --> 40:49.180
Oh, yeah, it's just
right down that way.

40:49.215 --> 40:50.753
- You're heading there, right?
- That way?

40:50.788 --> 40:52.282
- Yeah.
- So I just-- okay.

40:52.317 --> 40:54.086
Follow the path, brother,
you'll get there.

41:01.161 --> 41:03.733
Oh, hey!
I'm here, sorry.

41:03.768 --> 41:06.065
- I'm here.

41:06.100 --> 41:08.804
- You almost saw me naked.
- I almost did.

41:08.839 --> 41:10.740
- Almost.
- Almost.

41:10.775 --> 41:13.006
- Oh!

41:13.041 --> 41:15.646
One more!

41:15.681 --> 41:17.010
Oh, please--
please stop doing that.

41:17.045 --> 41:18.682
I'm just kidding.
I wouldn't do that.

41:18.717 --> 41:20.585
- Okay.
- Maybe I would.

41:20.620 --> 41:22.851
I...

41:22.886 --> 41:25.722
Oh, my God, how fucking
absurd is this place?

41:25.757 --> 41:27.691
Thank you.
Thank you, this is like,

41:27.726 --> 41:29.561
I've never seen
anything like this.

41:29.596 --> 41:31.794
I, like, need this
to work out with me and Ker.

41:31.829 --> 41:33.158
I can't go
back to being poor.

41:33.193 --> 41:34.830
Back to being a model, yeah?

41:34.865 --> 41:36.700
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, that's cool.

41:36.735 --> 41:37.932
Have I seen you in anything?

41:37.967 --> 41:39.296
Do you watch
"Murderer Minds"?

41:39.331 --> 41:41.265
- No.
- I was murdered on it.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.872
- Cool.
- I also sing,

41:43.907 --> 41:45.907
dance, paint.

41:45.942 --> 41:47.238
Run a wellness
Instagram account

41:47.273 --> 41:48.811
with over
50,000 followers.

41:48.846 --> 41:50.813
Oh, wow. You got
a lot going on, huh?

41:50.848 --> 41:53.178
Not really, I just try
to speak it into existence.

41:53.213 --> 41:54.916
Like "The Secret."

41:56.018 --> 41:57.919
No, it's not a secret.
I just don't wanna work hard.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.695
Okay.

42:06.864 --> 42:08.325
I'm bored.

42:12.166 --> 42:14.199
Cool.

42:24.948 --> 42:26.717
Oh...

43:15.801 --> 43:18.868
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

43:18.903 --> 43:20.969
- What're you getting?
- Mischief.

43:21.004 --> 43:22.905
All right, okay.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.973
How about a little--
ooh, this one has

43:25.008 --> 43:26.942
- some secrets.

43:26.977 --> 43:29.714
Did you guys know
that nearly 3%

43:29.749 --> 43:33.245
of Atlantic glaciers is
penguin urine?

43:36.283 --> 43:37.414
Car, who told you that?

43:37.449 --> 43:39.086
I learned it at Harvard.

43:44.225 --> 43:45.895
That's awesome.
You went to Harvard.

43:45.930 --> 43:47.699
Yeah, you didn't know?

43:47.734 --> 43:49.734
- No, no, I didn't...

43:49.769 --> 43:52.363
Lindz, just have one.

43:52.398 --> 43:54.266
- God, I--
- Come on, we're wine tasting

43:54.301 --> 43:56.202
in, like, 30 minutes, this'll
get you back in the game.

43:56.237 --> 43:59.007
I know, I just-- I feel
like I'm dying right now.

43:59.042 --> 44:00.404
Did you drink
the electrolytes?

44:00.439 --> 44:02.307
- Yeah.
- Oh.

44:02.342 --> 44:04.045
I'll text Milton
and have him put

44:04.080 --> 44:05.849
- another kit in the room.
- Okay.

44:05.884 --> 44:08.786
I'm sorry, hey,
who-- who is Milton?

44:09.921 --> 44:11.283
He's Milton.

44:11.318 --> 44:13.186
What would you say
his job is?

44:13.221 --> 44:15.353
- Jack.
- Um...

44:15.388 --> 44:17.960
I think he was, like,
a party planner

44:17.995 --> 44:19.830
or maybe
an interior designer.

44:19.865 --> 44:21.865
Um, Matt, babe,
how would you describe

44:21.900 --> 44:24.494
- what Milton does?
- Uh...

44:24.529 --> 44:27.497
he's...
he's Milton.

44:27.532 --> 44:29.873
Okay, and then
the-- the-the guys,

44:29.908 --> 44:31.743
I met the guy watering
the plant today

44:31.778 --> 44:33.745
- with the mullet.
- Uh, that is Daniel.

44:33.780 --> 44:36.077
- Daniel-- and Daniel--
- Oh, Dan!

44:36.112 --> 44:37.881
Yeah, Brother Dan,
Dan is the man!

44:37.916 --> 44:40.818
Daniel is Daniel,
and I...

44:40.853 --> 44:42.787
don't want to talk
about it anymore.

44:42.822 --> 44:44.085
It's high acid.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.889
What I do want
to talk about is

44:45.924 --> 44:47.792
my-- babe--

44:47.827 --> 44:49.288
- Do you feel that--
- Babe, I'm trying to--

44:49.323 --> 44:50.927
- I'm having a moment.
- What, babe, what?

44:50.962 --> 44:52.126
- Please.
- I'm talking--

44:52.161 --> 44:53.831
I'm talking too!

44:53.866 --> 44:56.196
What I do want
to talk about is

44:56.231 --> 44:58.528
my friend Lindz.

44:58.563 --> 45:01.102
Matt, did you know
that Lindz was studying

45:01.137 --> 45:03.038
at FIDM
before Jack got disbarred

45:03.073 --> 45:05.436
- and her mother died?
- Oh, no, I didn't know that.

45:05.471 --> 45:07.812
- Yeah.
- Jack didn't get disbarred.

45:07.847 --> 45:09.209
- He's just--
- She wanted to make upscale

45:09.244 --> 45:11.409
sustainable clothing.

45:11.444 --> 45:13.444
You want to make
upscale sustainable clothing.

45:13.479 --> 45:17.151
I've been thinking about it,
and I wanna help Lindz

45:17.186 --> 45:20.957
realize her dream
of becoming a girlboss.

45:20.992 --> 45:22.827
Yes, girlboss.

45:22.862 --> 45:25.126
- Wait, what?
- Wait, what?

45:25.161 --> 45:27.557
I think we should invest
in our friend Lindz

45:27.592 --> 45:30.197
and help make
her dream a reality.

45:30.232 --> 45:32.232
Hey...

45:32.267 --> 45:33.497
sure, yeah.

45:33.532 --> 45:34.971
Right on--
congrats, Lindz.

45:35.006 --> 45:36.335
- Let's do it.
- Yeah!

45:36.370 --> 45:37.974
- Let's do it.
- Congratulations!

45:39.505 --> 45:41.912
- What--
- Cheers! Cheers!

45:41.947 --> 45:43.881
- Yeah, no, we're...
- Congratulations.

45:43.916 --> 45:47.049
Oh, sure,
it's... thank you!

45:47.084 --> 45:48.886
- Oh, my God.
- Of course.

45:48.921 --> 45:50.349
- Yeah.
- So, I-- I mean,

45:50.384 --> 45:52.483
what...

45:52.518 --> 45:54.518
so do you wanna do the store?
Or do you wanna do a line?

45:54.553 --> 45:55.959
Oh, well, I haven't really
thought about it, let's talk

45:55.994 --> 45:57.290
- about it later, okay?
- Okay.

45:57.325 --> 45:58.962
We gotta do wine tasting
first, remember?

45:58.997 --> 46:00.392
- What just happened?
- Wine tasting

46:00.427 --> 46:02.229
- is happening.
- Whoo!

46:02.264 --> 46:04.495
There's this cute
little place down the road.

46:04.530 --> 46:06.299
All the workers who pick
the grapes are given

46:06.334 --> 46:08.136
insurance
and livable wages.

46:08.171 --> 46:10.138
- And we have to support them.
- I got it.

46:10.173 --> 46:12.173
Matt, do you wanna--
do you want me to pitch in?

46:12.208 --> 46:13.603
I could just sell
my car or something.

46:13.638 --> 46:15.539
- I could probably...

46:15.574 --> 46:17.442
- This guy!
- We got it.

46:17.477 --> 46:19.180
- He's so funny.
- You know--

46:19.215 --> 46:21.446
Jack, I will
take payment from you

46:21.481 --> 46:22.953
in karate-chopping
my enemies.

46:22.988 --> 46:24.383
- Kerry, Kerry,

46:24.418 --> 46:25.989
did you hear that?
That was so funny.

46:26.024 --> 46:27.892
- Hilarious.
- Finish your drinks.

46:27.927 --> 46:29.223
- Finish your drinks, dummies.
- Let's go, come on.

46:29.258 --> 46:30.620
- Okay, okay, bottoms up.
- Oh, hey--

46:30.655 --> 46:32.622
- Yes.
- Jack, are you gonna drive?

46:32.657 --> 46:34.525
Yeah, I'll drive
Lindsay and I separate,

46:34.560 --> 46:35.966
and we'll meet you guys
there, yeah?

46:38.234 --> 46:41.433
- What the fuck just happened?
- I know.

46:41.468 --> 46:45.074
Okay, this is now not
just a fun weekend,

46:45.109 --> 46:46.911
this is also
a business weekend.

46:46.946 --> 46:49.012
She could become
my colleague.

46:49.047 --> 46:51.883
Keeping it tight,
maybe not joke about us

46:51.918 --> 46:53.951
being poor
at the dinner table?

46:53.986 --> 46:56.019
But we're--
we're not poor.

46:56.054 --> 46:57.515
No, I know
that we're not poor,

46:57.550 --> 47:00.221
but compared to them,
we definitely are.

47:00.256 --> 47:01.959
Right, but compared to them,

47:01.994 --> 47:03.653
99.9% of the world is,

47:03.688 --> 47:06.194
I mean, Gary's grandfather
invented tater tots,

47:06.229 --> 47:08.361
and Matt's worth, like,
a billion dollars.

47:08.396 --> 47:10.198
- How do you know?
- I had service

47:10.233 --> 47:11.166
in the restaurant
and Googled him.

47:11.201 --> 47:12.904
Wait, why--

47:12.939 --> 47:14.631
- why'd you Google him?
- Why'd I...

47:14.666 --> 47:16.435
He ran a background check
on me-- I can't Google him?

47:16.470 --> 47:17.942
- No, I just--
- You said everybody Googles.

47:17.977 --> 47:19.977
Okay, just stop saying Google.

47:26.645 --> 47:28.546
Get your nose in the glass.

47:28.581 --> 47:31.021
Get it in there.
Further, further.

47:31.056 --> 47:32.451
Come on,
let's go ask Georges.

47:32.486 --> 47:34.618
Get it in there.

47:34.653 --> 47:37.654
Georges?
Am I on pills,

47:37.689 --> 47:39.524
or does this taste
more like a burgundy?

47:39.559 --> 47:41.262
No, you're not.

47:41.297 --> 47:43.297
Actually, it's because
it has a lower

47:43.332 --> 47:45.464
alcohol content
than most California pinots.

47:45.499 --> 47:47.697
- Mmm.
- It's because

47:47.732 --> 47:49.402
we're biodynamic.

47:49.437 --> 47:51.239
- Obviously.
- Obviously, now,

47:51.274 --> 47:53.571
correct me if I'm wrong,
but aren't you only

47:53.606 --> 47:56.640
one of four biodynamic
vineyards in California?

47:56.675 --> 47:58.279
- Am I right?
- One of four

47:58.314 --> 47:59.478
certified by
the French government.

47:59.513 --> 48:01.315
- Ahh.
- Yes.

48:01.350 --> 48:03.152
I love France.

48:03.187 --> 48:05.220
- Yeah, she does!
- Yeah, baby!

48:05.255 --> 48:07.189
That's... a great place.

48:07.224 --> 48:09.620
I love France.

48:09.655 --> 48:11.655
Honestly, I would love
to go to Provence.

48:11.690 --> 48:13.657
Oh, we're going.

48:13.692 --> 48:16.495
After you've set up the line.

48:16.530 --> 48:20.169
You're-- You're really serious
about this, aren't you?

48:20.204 --> 48:22.468
Be pretty fucked up
if I wasn't.

48:22.503 --> 48:25.240
- Hey, babe?

48:25.275 --> 48:28.276
- Yeah, babe?
- What-- What do we like?

48:28.311 --> 48:30.080
Uh, what do you like?

48:30.115 --> 48:32.379
- Um-- oh, I like the white.
- Which?

48:32.414 --> 48:35.514
Oh, um...
all of 'em.

48:35.549 --> 48:37.549
Get all the whites!

48:39.619 --> 48:41.091
You can spit the wine.
You don't have to swallow it

48:41.126 --> 48:42.422
- every time.
- Oh!

48:42.457 --> 48:44.127
No, I like swallowing.

48:44.162 --> 48:45.722
You heard the lady,
why don't we do

48:45.757 --> 48:48.098
a case of each?

48:48.133 --> 48:50.001
Oh...

48:50.036 --> 48:51.761
okay.

48:51.796 --> 48:54.401
Okay, um, why don't
I bring those to the car?

48:54.436 --> 48:56.469
And you can finish up
your glasses here?

48:56.504 --> 48:58.141
- Love it.
- Actually, Georges,

48:58.176 --> 48:59.439
you know what?
Why don't you just, uh,

48:59.474 --> 49:01.012
why don't you
just double it?

49:01.047 --> 49:03.740
Oh... double it?

49:03.775 --> 49:06.380
- Yeah, two cases of each.
- Each.

49:06.415 --> 49:08.679
- Okay, well, sorry.

49:08.714 --> 49:10.351
I went to Berkeley,

49:10.386 --> 49:12.287
so we didn't--
numbers were just shapes.

49:12.322 --> 49:14.619
- Sure, sure, sure...
- So, you want...

49:14.654 --> 49:19.129
two of both varietals
or four of both varietals?

49:19.164 --> 49:21.362
- Yes, both.
- Yes, both.

49:23.267 --> 49:25.696
- Each.
- Each.

49:25.731 --> 49:27.368
Wonderful.

49:27.403 --> 49:29.172
- That's white.
- Oh-- oopsies.

49:29.207 --> 49:31.042
It's rosé.

49:31.077 --> 49:32.670
I don't think--
is that how they make rosé?

49:32.705 --> 49:34.474
Mm-hm, you just mix
red and white.

49:34.509 --> 49:36.674
- Okay. Hi, hi.
- Hi, um,

49:36.709 --> 49:38.610
- which one did you like?
- I, uh...

49:38.645 --> 49:40.612
- Hi, thank you.
- Try the rosé.

49:40.647 --> 49:42.284
- Hi.
- No, it's-- we're great.

49:42.319 --> 49:44.121
Which-- Which wine did
I like, Carrie?

49:44.156 --> 49:46.486
Jackie likes
the penis noir.

49:48.391 --> 49:51.128
Penis... pinot noir.

49:51.163 --> 49:53.097
'Cause he likes the penis!

49:53.132 --> 49:54.461
- Okay.
- Okay, hey,

49:54.496 --> 49:56.067
so I think
we should get some wine.

49:56.102 --> 49:57.761
- Can you take care of that?
- Yeah.

49:57.796 --> 49:59.466
Yeah, no,
I'll get some wine.

49:59.501 --> 50:01.600
That's good. Can you maybe
just-- no, okay.

50:01.635 --> 50:03.239
Bye.

50:03.274 --> 50:05.142
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

50:05.177 --> 50:07.441
I guess I need
a bottle of, um, the--

50:07.476 --> 50:09.212
the pinot noir.

50:09.247 --> 50:10.708
Okay, just a bottle?

50:10.743 --> 50:12.380
Yeah, just--
just a bottle, please?

50:13.713 --> 50:15.581
- Can I see the price sheet?
- No.

50:15.616 --> 50:18.485
I'm sorry, I...

50:18.520 --> 50:20.421
it's market price,
so it just kind of like

50:20.456 --> 50:22.159
is what I feel
at the moment.

50:22.194 --> 50:23.853
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

50:23.888 --> 50:25.855
- Oh! Okay.
- There she goes.

50:25.890 --> 50:27.593
- Just--
- There she goes.

50:27.628 --> 50:29.364
- Oh, boy.
- She's fun.

50:29.399 --> 50:31.531
- Yeah, she's fun.
- Oh, maybe we--

50:31.566 --> 50:33.401
maybe we get to some
water there, Car-Bear.

50:33.436 --> 50:35.139
No water...

50:35.174 --> 50:37.471
Hey, Kerry, do you wanna
help me out here, bud?

50:37.506 --> 50:39.374
Dude, she's like 11 pounds,
you got it.

50:39.409 --> 50:40.771
- Okay.
- You're doing great, Jack.

50:40.806 --> 50:42.839
- Okay...
- Whee!

50:42.874 --> 50:44.709
Okay, I'm just gonna...

50:44.744 --> 50:46.612
Ballet!

50:46.647 --> 50:49.153
- Turn her on her side.
- Oh, that's sweet.

50:49.188 --> 50:50.484
- That's sweet.
- Well, I just don't want her

50:50.519 --> 50:52.288
to throw up
on those hair extensions.

50:52.323 --> 50:53.718
Take off those shoes,
they're very expensive.

50:53.753 --> 50:56.556
I have those.
My wife has those.

50:56.591 --> 50:58.360
Yeah.

50:58.395 --> 50:59.823
- Carrie is drunk.
- Yeah.

50:59.858 --> 51:02.298
Maybe we oughta,
like... yeah?

51:02.333 --> 51:04.267
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

51:04.302 --> 51:06.368
- Sure.

51:06.403 --> 51:08.337
- You're terrible.
- I know.

51:08.372 --> 51:10.438
So bad.
She's the worst, though.

51:12.475 --> 51:14.376
No, you did not say that.

51:14.411 --> 51:15.773
You didn't.

51:15.808 --> 51:17.577
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

51:17.612 --> 51:19.414
Uh, we may need
to Uber home.

51:19.449 --> 51:21.845
- Ooh, we don't have room?
- Yeah, no.

51:21.880 --> 51:23.517
Hey, I got the wine.

51:24.949 --> 51:27.389
- Yeah, what?
- Just...

51:27.424 --> 51:28.753
...why did you

51:28.788 --> 51:30.920
only get a bottle?

51:30.955 --> 51:32.658
Well, because Carrie said
it was my favorite.

51:32.693 --> 51:34.462
It's the penis noir,
and then

51:34.497 --> 51:36.167
Matt said it would go
with the BBQ tonight.

51:36.202 --> 51:37.828
Okay, but why didn't
you get a case?

51:37.863 --> 51:39.566
'Cause they're, like,
really expensive.

51:39.601 --> 51:41.634
- Like how expensive?
- Like-- Like, a lot.

51:41.669 --> 51:44.274
- What's a lot?
- Like, $50 a bottle.

51:44.309 --> 51:46.474
Oh... okay, well,

51:46.509 --> 51:48.707
just put it on the Mastercard.
We can afford that.

51:48.742 --> 51:51.644
You wanna waste $300
on six bottles of wine?

51:51.679 --> 51:53.514
- A case is 12.
- A case is six.

51:53.549 --> 51:55.450
- A case of beer is 12.
- A case of beer is 24.

51:55.485 --> 51:56.583
- What is a case of 12?
- I have no idea, White Claw?

51:56.618 --> 51:57.947
Just buy it.

51:57.982 --> 51:59.421
Lindsay,
that's a car payment.

51:59.456 --> 52:00.719
Hey, Georges,
I'm so sorry.

52:00.754 --> 52:02.457
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:02.492 --> 52:03.920
My husband made a mistake.

52:03.955 --> 52:05.328
We are actually going
to take a case

52:05.363 --> 52:06.824
of the pinot grigio.

52:06.859 --> 52:09.497
- Pinot noir.
- Of the pinot noir.

52:09.532 --> 52:11.202
- Absolutely.

52:11.237 --> 52:12.764
And you know what,
actually, we're gonna get

52:12.799 --> 52:14.700
two cases, right?

52:14.735 --> 52:17.307
Because we can have
one with the dinner tonight,

52:17.342 --> 52:19.804
and then we can take one home,
right, Jack?

52:19.839 --> 52:21.575
It's gonna go great
with the dinner.

52:21.610 --> 52:23.280
Yeah, you know,
you do get a discount

52:23.315 --> 52:24.941
if you buy a case.
That's great.

52:24.976 --> 52:26.712
So just charge
the same card?

52:26.747 --> 52:28.417
- Yes, absolutely.
- Okay.

52:28.452 --> 52:30.518
- Thank you so much.
- That is...

52:30.553 --> 52:32.850
- so thoughtful of you.
- Ugh, oh, my gosh.

52:32.885 --> 52:34.819
It's the least we could do,
right, Jack?

52:34.854 --> 52:37.756
Yeah, yeah, you know,
I just-- I just had a thought.

52:37.791 --> 52:39.593
What if-- What if we take
the Tesla back

52:39.628 --> 52:40.957
since we're waiting
for the rest of the wine

52:40.992 --> 52:42.563
to show up, and you guys
just take my car,

52:42.598 --> 52:43.663
and we'll see you
back there, yeah?

52:43.698 --> 52:45.302
- You sure?
- Yeah.

52:45.337 --> 52:46.501
Do you know
how to drive a Tesla,

52:46.536 --> 52:49.306
- Jack?
- Do I...

52:49.341 --> 52:51.869
I think
the real question, Ker,

52:51.904 --> 52:54.311
is do you know
how to drive a Corolla?

52:54.346 --> 52:56.775
So funny.

52:56.810 --> 52:59.250
You-- You put it in drive?

52:59.285 --> 53:00.977
Yep, just start it, drive,
you're good to go.

53:01.012 --> 53:03.980
- All right.
- Okay.

53:04.015 --> 53:05.784
- Okay.
- Okay, cool,

53:05.819 --> 53:07.456
we'll just do
a little switcheroo.

53:07.491 --> 53:08.853
- Cute, love it.
- Right.

53:08.888 --> 53:11.328
- Thanks, Jackie.
- Okay.

53:11.363 --> 53:13.792
Definitely sitting up here.

53:13.827 --> 53:15.563
- Thank you.
- Watch your head, Carrie.

53:15.598 --> 53:16.993
- Ooh!
- Good work.

53:17.028 --> 53:18.533
Oh, she lost
her little crown.

53:18.568 --> 53:19.897
Yeah, that's okay.

53:19.932 --> 53:21.668
Okay.

53:21.703 --> 53:24.704
Yeah... origami.

53:31.614 --> 53:33.284
Bye!

53:35.420 --> 53:37.046
We need to get rid
of this fucking wine.

53:37.081 --> 53:39.818
- What? Why?
- Because we can't afford it.

53:39.853 --> 53:43.690
- Why?
- Because...

53:43.725 --> 53:46.627
it's $300 a bottle.

53:46.662 --> 53:48.365
- What?
- Yeah.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.059
You said that it was 50.

53:50.094 --> 53:51.896
Because I didn't want you
to get pissed off at me

53:51.931 --> 53:53.634
for spending $300
on a bottle of wine.

53:53.669 --> 53:55.471
So, you lied to me.

53:55.506 --> 53:57.341
I-- no.

53:57.376 --> 53:59.310
No, not doing this right now.
Georges, hi!

53:59.345 --> 54:01.037
Hi, you know what,
I think my wife is

54:01.072 --> 54:02.544
actually the one
who made a mistake here.

54:02.579 --> 54:04.414
We need to return
this wine please.

54:04.449 --> 54:06.449
- Oh, no, we don't do that.
- You don't do what?

54:06.484 --> 54:08.913
We don't do refunds.

54:08.948 --> 54:11.520
- Okay... okay...

54:11.555 --> 54:13.489
...we're good--
look, hey, hey.

54:13.524 --> 54:15.458
- Yeah?
- I work in sales, okay?

54:15.493 --> 54:17.394
I get it, right? You gotta get
your nut here, right?

54:17.429 --> 54:19.363
Okay, no-no-no-no-no.
I got my nut.

54:19.398 --> 54:21.530
And I got their nut,
and I got your nut,

54:21.565 --> 54:24.830
and I got all your nuts
all over my face, okay?

54:24.865 --> 54:27.503
And we still
don't do refunds.

54:27.538 --> 54:28.933
No, wait, look--
fuck, come on,

54:28.968 --> 54:30.803
- come on, hey, hey, look--
- Jack?

54:30.838 --> 54:32.607
It's still in the box, right?
It's still organic.

54:32.642 --> 54:34.103
Biodynamic.

54:34.138 --> 54:35.577
And overpriced.
You can take this back--

54:35.612 --> 54:37.040
- No, no, that's okay.
- Jack?

54:37.075 --> 54:38.481
- He needs to take this back!
- Jack!

54:38.516 --> 54:40.384
What?

54:40.419 --> 54:42.386
- We have to keep it.
- Why?

54:42.421 --> 54:44.685
Because we said we would
drink it at dinner tonight.

54:46.590 --> 54:48.458
Fuck!

54:57.931 --> 55:00.063
You do not get to be mad
at me about this.

55:00.098 --> 55:01.834
I don't get to be mad
at you about this.

55:01.869 --> 55:03.869
- Don't do that, Jack.
- Do what?

55:03.904 --> 55:05.739
- Don't do the thing.
- What thing?

55:05.774 --> 55:07.642
- The lawyer thing.
- I'm not doing

55:07.677 --> 55:10.040
a lawyer thing, I'm just...
making a counterpoint.

55:10.075 --> 55:12.812
Oh, there it is.

55:12.847 --> 55:14.847
You lied to me.
It's as simple as that.

55:14.882 --> 55:18.114
Okay, um, I'd just argue
that I lied to you

55:18.149 --> 55:20.457
because you're really
embarrassed of me.

55:20.492 --> 55:22.558
I am not embarrassed of you.

55:22.593 --> 55:25.561
I-- mm, see, you want us
to be these people,

55:25.596 --> 55:28.157
and we're just not,
and, like, that's okay.

55:28.192 --> 55:31.501
These people are
miserable and drunks.

55:31.536 --> 55:33.569
They're drunks?

55:33.604 --> 55:35.538
They haven't stopped drinking
since we got here.

55:35.573 --> 55:37.969
- It's her birthday weekend.
- Which she didn't tell you.

55:38.004 --> 55:40.642
Because she didn't want it
to be weird.

55:47.618 --> 55:50.454
We are currently
sitting in a car

55:50.489 --> 55:52.951
that is worth $100,000.

55:52.986 --> 55:54.755
Inside of that car,

55:54.790 --> 55:57.758
there is
$150,000 worth of wine.

56:00.158 --> 56:02.026
This is weird.

56:11.235 --> 56:12.872
Hi.

56:12.907 --> 56:15.545
- Hey!
- Hi!

56:15.580 --> 56:17.074
You changed.

56:17.109 --> 56:19.450
Oh, it's murder mystery night.

56:19.485 --> 56:21.111
Milton made it
a Roaring '20s theme.

56:21.146 --> 56:24.114
Oh, um, I just--

56:24.149 --> 56:25.819
I didn't bring
anything to wear.

56:25.854 --> 56:27.722
Oh, that's okay,
Milton took care of it all.

56:27.757 --> 56:29.691
There's some stuff
in your room, go get changed,

56:29.726 --> 56:31.858
and then come back up here
whenever you're ready,

56:31.893 --> 56:33.959
and we're all gonna
go down to the farmhouse.

56:33.994 --> 56:36.764
Okay-- oh,
we brought the wine.

56:36.799 --> 56:38.964
- Wine?
- From, um...

56:38.999 --> 56:42.231
- from the tasting.
- Oh, right!

56:42.266 --> 56:44.541
Great, um, yeah,
you can just put that

56:44.576 --> 56:46.235
downstairs in the cellar
and then go get changed.

56:46.270 --> 56:48.138
We're gonna
kill each other!

56:48.173 --> 56:50.613
- Hey, Jack, tonight,

56:50.648 --> 56:53.110
why don't you pick on a vase
your own size, see?!

56:53.145 --> 56:55.145
- Argh, ya see?

57:10.635 --> 57:11.865
Well, good thing
we bought two.

57:11.900 --> 57:13.130
Okay.

57:22.548 --> 57:25.241
They know my sizes?
How do they do that?

57:25.276 --> 57:27.749
God, I want a Milton.

57:31.018 --> 57:33.722
- Listen up!

57:33.757 --> 57:36.989
It seems there be
a murderer in our midst.

57:37.024 --> 57:38.254
- My name is

57:38.289 --> 57:40.597
Police Chief
Danny O'Sullivan!

57:40.632 --> 57:42.632
And if there's one thing
I won't stand,

57:42.667 --> 57:45.261
it's murderers in Chicago.

57:45.296 --> 57:47.164
- Ooh.
- Manila!

57:47.199 --> 57:50.167
Now, it seems
that someone's been

57:50.202 --> 57:52.642
feeding me intel
on the inside.

57:52.677 --> 57:54.578
Isn't that right,
Becca Brasco?

57:54.613 --> 57:56.272
Yeah, see?!

57:56.307 --> 57:58.010
Me and my crew,
we've been taking over

57:58.045 --> 57:59.715
the South Side, see?!

57:59.750 --> 58:01.849
When there was one person

58:01.884 --> 58:04.082
standing in our way...

58:06.922 --> 58:08.185
Jack, that's--
that's your turn.

58:08.220 --> 58:09.626
- Yeah, you go.
- It's your turn.

58:09.661 --> 58:11.287
- Read the card.
- I just read it?

58:11.322 --> 58:13.564
- Just read the card.
- Just the card? Okay, um,

58:13.599 --> 58:14.631
Where did these cards
come from?

58:14.666 --> 58:16.193
"I'm Michael O'Malley

58:16.228 --> 58:17.898
"from the south side.
My brother Patrick

58:17.933 --> 58:19.196
- was murdered--"
- Okay, now, Jack, can you

58:19.231 --> 58:21.033
please commit
to the character?

58:21.068 --> 58:22.672
- Do an accent.
- Can you give a--

58:22.707 --> 58:24.674
It's so freeing
when you just read it

58:24.709 --> 58:27.039
- with an accent.
- Okay, yeah, okay.

58:27.074 --> 58:29.206
Okay, um--

58:29.241 --> 58:30.779
"I'm Michael O'Malley

58:30.814 --> 58:32.176
from the South Side.

58:32.211 --> 58:35.047
My brother Patrick was
murdered.

58:35.082 --> 58:36.851
People think I did it
to take control

58:36.886 --> 58:38.721
of the potato trade,

58:38.756 --> 58:40.151
but that's impossible

58:40.186 --> 58:41.955
because I was
on the north side

58:41.990 --> 58:44.254
with Don Kerryon--"
that's Kerry.

58:44.289 --> 58:46.630
Ahh, that's-ah me!

58:49.833 --> 58:52.900
"While I was on the north side
with Don Ker-leone!"

58:52.935 --> 58:55.100
True, true, that is true.

58:55.135 --> 58:57.839
Because there's not
one person in this room

58:57.874 --> 59:00.908
that didn't stand to gain
from Patrick's death.

59:00.943 --> 59:03.779
Especially the wife!

59:07.785 --> 59:09.213
Let's just pick up the cues.

59:09.248 --> 59:10.819
Just pick up
the cues, everyone.

59:10.854 --> 59:12.282
- Seriously, take this.
- Becca was

59:12.317 --> 59:13.855
a Fulbright scholar.
She's completely

59:13.890 --> 59:15.791
wasting her life here.

59:15.826 --> 59:17.859
- Love you, Becky.
- Okay, sorry, Becca.

59:17.894 --> 59:19.157
Total respect.

59:19.192 --> 59:20.994
Yeah, that's embarrassing.

59:21.029 --> 59:22.633
- You got it, babe, go.

59:22.668 --> 59:23.898
- You got it.
- "It couldn't've been me.

59:23.933 --> 59:25.735
I loved my husband.

59:25.770 --> 59:28.133
We immigrated here
together from Kilkenny.

59:28.168 --> 59:30.168
On that ride
across the Atlantic,

59:30.203 --> 59:31.807
we would talk about
the better life

59:31.842 --> 59:33.644
America would show us.

59:33.679 --> 59:36.372
We heard that there are
no cats in America,

59:36.407 --> 59:39.012
and the streets are
made of cheese.

59:39.047 --> 59:40.849
- Is she going off script?
- Yeah, it's brilliant.

59:40.884 --> 59:43.379
"Upon arriving in New York,

59:43.414 --> 59:45.315
- Patrick took me in his--"
- Chicago! Chicago.

59:45.350 --> 59:49.154
"--Chicago, Patrick took me
in his arms and said,

59:49.189 --> 59:52.157
We will never want
for anything again."

59:52.192 --> 59:55.666
And then one of you monsters
murdered him!

1:00:00.937 --> 1:00:02.871
Wow!

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:16.214
Ooh!

1:00:26.864 --> 1:00:29.194
Dude's got cryptocurrency.
Secret currency.

1:00:29.229 --> 1:00:31.361
Right? It's just--
it's an idea.

1:00:31.396 --> 1:00:33.264
Where do we put the crypto?

1:00:33.299 --> 1:00:36.201
In storage.
Is it a fuckin' crypto bank?

1:00:36.236 --> 1:00:38.808
- I don't know yet.
- You all right, bud?

1:00:38.843 --> 1:00:40.810
I'm just in a dark--
a dark hole right now.

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:42.174
Come here, come here,
come here, come here...

1:00:42.209 --> 1:00:43.813
Then come sit,
come sit, come sit.

1:00:43.848 --> 1:00:46.079
- This is how we come out

1:00:46.114 --> 1:00:48.719
the other side.
He goes in here...

1:00:48.754 --> 1:00:50.820
- Just give it-- watch,

1:00:50.855 --> 1:00:56.287
watch, five, four,
three, two, one.

1:00:58.390 --> 1:01:00.357
What's up, guys?
All right.

1:01:00.392 --> 1:01:02.227
So what you're gonna want
is you're gonna want

1:01:02.262 --> 1:01:04.064
cold storage,
cold storage can make it

1:01:04.099 --> 1:01:05.769
so it can't be encrypted
by other people.

1:01:05.804 --> 1:01:07.199
- That's it right there.
- So you have a passcode

1:01:07.234 --> 1:01:09.201
which is gonna break it up...

1:01:09.236 --> 1:01:12.171
And the Boner Award...

1:01:12.206 --> 1:01:15.207
- ...for Worst Job

1:01:15.242 --> 1:01:17.242
Keeping Their Facts
Straight goes to...

1:01:17.277 --> 1:01:18.441
Oh, I know
who that is.

1:01:18.476 --> 1:01:20.179
Jack!

1:01:21.787 --> 1:01:24.183
Yay, Jack!

1:01:24.218 --> 1:01:26.251
- Ah-- ah!

1:01:26.286 --> 1:01:28.990
- Uh-- fuck you.

1:01:30.521 --> 1:01:32.290
You have to use that, Jack.

1:01:32.325 --> 1:01:35.491
He's a good sport--
and last but not least,

1:01:35.526 --> 1:01:37.526
the award
for Finest Performance

1:01:37.561 --> 1:01:40.133
goes to...

1:01:40.168 --> 1:01:44.775
- Lindsay!

1:01:44.810 --> 1:01:47.074
Oh, my God!

1:01:47.109 --> 1:01:48.779
I would like to thank
all of you, blah-blah-blah,

1:01:48.814 --> 1:01:51.144
this is amazing!

1:01:51.179 --> 1:01:55.247
Oh, my God, of course
you think Lindz gave

1:01:55.282 --> 1:01:57.249
the best performance.

1:01:57.284 --> 1:01:59.119
What are you talking about?
Lindz was great.

1:01:59.154 --> 1:02:01.088
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, she's amazing.

1:02:01.123 --> 1:02:03.992
I-- Becca was--
pfft!-- wet.

1:02:04.027 --> 1:02:08.326
But-But Daniel knows Lindz
from high school, so...

1:02:08.361 --> 1:02:10.262
She rocked it,
she was in all the plays.

1:02:10.297 --> 1:02:11.967
I think he's a little biased.

1:02:12.002 --> 1:02:13.903
Wait, high school?

1:02:13.938 --> 1:02:15.971
- Yeah.
- Daniel...

1:02:16.006 --> 1:02:18.809
Daniel and Lindz went
to high school together.

1:02:18.844 --> 1:02:20.976
And they used to,
you know, they used to...

1:02:21.011 --> 1:02:23.044
- Cat.
- ...whatever.

1:02:23.079 --> 1:02:26.212
- Oh.
- They used to what?

1:02:26.247 --> 1:02:29.446
No, well, we just-- we went
to high school together.

1:02:29.481 --> 1:02:32.053
It's not a big deal.
You knew that.

1:02:32.088 --> 1:02:35.089
I didn't.
I didn't know that, Dan.

1:02:35.124 --> 1:02:37.355
Oh... yeah, well...

1:02:37.390 --> 1:02:38.994
oh.

1:02:40.096 --> 1:02:42.129
Dan?

1:02:43.968 --> 1:02:46.067
Dan...

1:02:46.102 --> 1:02:48.872
Dan, oh...

1:02:48.907 --> 1:02:52.502
- you're Dan.
- Yeah, brother.

1:03:00.578 --> 1:03:03.249
May I speak to you privately
over there please?

1:03:03.284 --> 1:03:05.284
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

1:03:07.321 --> 1:03:09.959
Uh, anybody want

1:03:09.994 --> 1:03:11.862
- a refill?
- Blue penis.

1:03:11.897 --> 1:03:14.161
- Over here.
- Babe, they called him

1:03:14.196 --> 1:03:16.592
Big Dick Dan 'cause
he's very well-endowed.

1:03:16.627 --> 1:03:18.627
Oh! Brother Dan's

1:03:18.662 --> 1:03:20.970
packing a real
ham cannon, huh?

1:03:21.005 --> 1:03:22.906
I see that
for Dan, yeah.

1:03:22.941 --> 1:03:25.238
But it's, like, a--
it's like a thing for Jack

1:03:25.273 --> 1:03:27.240
because he doesn't have--
well, he's--

1:03:27.275 --> 1:03:28.604
'Cause-- 'Cause,
is Jack not packing

1:03:28.639 --> 1:03:30.474
- a ham cannon?
- No, he has...

1:03:30.509 --> 1:03:32.377
Is that Big Dick Dan?

1:03:32.412 --> 1:03:33.576
- Okay, can we just--
- No, yes or no question.

1:03:33.611 --> 1:03:34.984
Is that Big Dick Dan?

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:37.954
Yes.

1:03:40.651 --> 1:03:43.322
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

1:03:43.357 --> 1:03:45.456
Okay.

1:03:45.491 --> 1:03:48.030
I am not going to point out

1:03:48.065 --> 1:03:49.559
that you just ripped me
a new asshole in the car

1:03:49.594 --> 1:03:51.363
for lying to you
about a bottle of wine.

1:03:51.398 --> 1:03:54.234
I-- but you kind of are

1:03:54.269 --> 1:03:56.973
by saying that, so...

1:03:58.240 --> 1:03:59.943
That is fair.

1:03:59.978 --> 1:04:02.605
So I'm not gonna do that.

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:04.915
And I am not
gonna freak out

1:04:04.950 --> 1:04:07.610
- now that I have met Dan.
- Which, Jack, honey,

1:04:07.645 --> 1:04:09.920
that really was
so long ago.

1:04:09.955 --> 1:04:12.351
And it's great that you
wouldn't freak out about it

1:04:12.386 --> 1:04:16.025
because it was another person,
it was another time, you know?

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:17.356
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Okay.

1:04:17.391 --> 1:04:19.127
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

1:04:19.162 --> 1:04:21.195
So I'm just gonna...

1:04:21.230 --> 1:04:24.099
I'm just gonna push this,
like, deep...

1:04:24.134 --> 1:04:25.969
deep...

1:04:26.004 --> 1:04:29.137
- down inside...
- Okay.

1:04:29.172 --> 1:04:30.402
And we are just
gonna deal with this

1:04:30.437 --> 1:04:32.173
when we get home, okay?

1:04:34.045 --> 1:04:36.441
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1:04:42.152 --> 1:04:43.646
I am so sorry.

1:04:43.681 --> 1:04:46.649
Thanks, Cat.
Not your fault.

1:04:57.761 --> 1:04:59.596
Actually,
I didn't know that,

1:04:59.631 --> 1:05:02.566
but I don't care.

1:05:02.601 --> 1:05:07.472
And after hearing about
Daniel and his ham cannon,

1:05:07.507 --> 1:05:08.737
I'm probably gonna
have sex with him, too.

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:10.442
Is that okay with you, Ker?

1:05:10.477 --> 1:05:12.609
I seriously do not care.

1:05:12.644 --> 1:05:14.710
And I'm not judging
anyone here.

1:05:14.745 --> 1:05:16.217
That's beautiful, brother.

1:05:18.023 --> 1:05:20.023
I mean,
at the end of the day,

1:05:20.058 --> 1:05:22.322
it's just sex, right?

1:05:22.357 --> 1:05:24.588
Yes, I've had sex
with your wife,

1:05:24.623 --> 1:05:28.163
and I've had sex
with Becca.

1:05:28.198 --> 1:05:30.495
And it sounds like I'm gonna
have sex with Carrie.

1:05:32.466 --> 1:05:35.137
And that's awesome.

1:05:35.172 --> 1:05:37.403
But what you have, brother,

1:05:37.438 --> 1:05:39.603
that's deeper
than penetration.

1:05:41.178 --> 1:05:43.046
You have a life.

1:05:43.081 --> 1:05:44.509
And I think
it's a great honor

1:05:44.544 --> 1:05:46.346
to be bonded like this
to another man.

1:05:47.580 --> 1:05:49.547
Look... Lindsay taught me

1:05:49.582 --> 1:05:51.516
so much about sex,
and I taught her

1:05:51.551 --> 1:05:53.584
a bunch
of cool stuff, too.

1:05:53.619 --> 1:05:55.718
And you're still reaping
those benefits today.

1:05:55.753 --> 1:05:57.555
So...

1:05:57.590 --> 1:05:59.425
thank you.

1:05:59.460 --> 1:06:01.427
And you're welcome.

1:06:01.462 --> 1:06:03.264
I'm welcome?

1:06:03.299 --> 1:06:05.530
Yeah.
I mean, obviously,

1:06:05.565 --> 1:06:07.499
we're gonna have
different experiences

1:06:07.534 --> 1:06:08.731
because we have
different body types.

1:06:08.766 --> 1:06:10.535
You're shorter than I am.

1:06:10.570 --> 1:06:12.438
I'm-- are you saying
I'm smaller than you?

1:06:12.473 --> 1:06:14.209
Yeah, well,
you're like five--

1:06:14.244 --> 1:06:15.606
What the fuck is that

1:06:15.641 --> 1:06:17.542
- supposed to mean?
- Jack?

1:06:17.577 --> 1:06:19.445
- It's okay, brother.
- --I'm smaller than you?

1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:21.150
I'm fucking shorter than you?
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1:06:21.185 --> 1:06:22.811
- this is very--
- Triggering?

1:06:22.846 --> 1:06:24.648
Thank you, Ker,
not really the time right now.

1:06:24.683 --> 1:06:26.287
- Sounds like we just got--
- Don't touch me, man!

1:06:26.322 --> 1:06:28.058
- Jack!

1:06:28.093 --> 1:06:29.653
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?

1:06:29.688 --> 1:06:31.754
- Give me that!
- No-- whoa-- no, no!

1:06:33.659 --> 1:06:35.461
Take his power!
Grab it!

1:06:38.433 --> 1:06:40.763
- Time out!
- Careful! Careful!

1:06:42.404 --> 1:06:44.668
Oh! Oh!

1:06:44.703 --> 1:06:46.736
Please!
I wanna stop!

1:06:46.771 --> 1:06:49.310
I wanna stop!
I wanna stop! Please stop.

1:06:49.345 --> 1:06:52.445
- I wanna-- yes!
- Aah.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:54.645
Well, my thirst for blood
remains unquenched.

1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:56.614
Yeah, yeah--
hey, fellas,

1:06:56.649 --> 1:06:58.517
this is getting
"hard-on" to watch.

1:06:58.552 --> 1:07:01.091
- I have lower back issues.

1:07:01.126 --> 1:07:02.620
Oh, me too, man.

1:07:02.655 --> 1:07:04.292
And the winner
of the weirdest fight

1:07:04.327 --> 1:07:06.657
in history...
is Jack!

1:07:09.695 --> 1:07:12.399
Oh, God.

1:07:14.832 --> 1:07:16.601
- Lindsay?
- Dan?!

1:07:16.636 --> 1:07:19.175
You get the fuck
outta here now!

1:07:19.210 --> 1:07:21.738
Go upstairs,
go to bed.

1:07:21.773 --> 1:07:23.443
Think about
what you did.

1:07:23.478 --> 1:07:26.149
Goddamnit.
I'll see you in the morning.

1:07:26.184 --> 1:07:27.876
Hey, thank you for
all your hard work tonight,

1:07:27.911 --> 1:07:29.515
by the way.
Thank you very much.

1:07:29.550 --> 1:07:30.813
I'll see you
upstairs, Dan.

1:07:30.848 --> 1:07:32.782
Excellent storytelling.

1:07:32.817 --> 1:07:34.388
- That guy's the best.
- Really lovely.

1:07:34.423 --> 1:07:35.752
That was impressive.

1:07:35.787 --> 1:07:37.292
He is the fucking best, man.

1:07:42.761 --> 1:07:45.696
- Why are you sad?
- Because...

1:07:45.731 --> 1:07:48.732
Jack was doing
so much better.

1:07:48.767 --> 1:07:52.505
You know?

1:07:53.904 --> 1:07:55.442
But he won the fight.

1:07:55.477 --> 1:07:57.345
Oh, my God.

1:07:57.380 --> 1:07:59.710
He's gonna actually
go to jail.

1:07:59.745 --> 1:08:01.910
- Why?
- Because

1:08:01.945 --> 1:08:04.484
he assaulted Dan,

1:08:04.519 --> 1:08:06.255
and Dan's gonna
press charges.

1:08:06.290 --> 1:08:08.356
Oh, no, he won't.

1:08:08.391 --> 1:08:11.920
Daniel has signed
multiple NDAs--

1:08:11.955 --> 1:08:15.198
--and he gets asshole tax

1:08:15.233 --> 1:08:17.299
every time something
like this happens.

1:08:17.334 --> 1:08:18.894
Oh, what is asshole tax?

1:08:20.469 --> 1:08:22.799
Daniel and Becca get
an extra ten grand

1:08:22.834 --> 1:08:25.868
every time
my husband or a guest

1:08:25.903 --> 1:08:28.442
is an asshole.

1:08:28.477 --> 1:08:30.312
Wow.

1:08:30.347 --> 1:08:31.808
This happens a lot.

1:08:33.614 --> 1:08:35.185
- Okay.
- He makes

1:08:35.220 --> 1:08:37.187
way too much money
to try to...

1:08:37.222 --> 1:08:39.816
- Yeah.

1:08:41.226 --> 1:08:42.423
I'm gonna get my...

1:08:42.458 --> 1:08:43.886
my girl.

1:08:43.921 --> 1:08:45.789
My girl, Gigi.

1:08:45.824 --> 1:08:47.527
- Gigi?
- Yeah.

1:08:47.562 --> 1:08:49.595
She is the solution.

1:08:49.630 --> 1:08:52.202
- Gigi is the solution?
- She's a witch.

1:08:52.237 --> 1:08:54.435
She's a good witch.

1:08:57.770 --> 1:08:59.605
I have to go to bed.

1:09:02.610 --> 1:09:05.776
- Good night.

1:09:07.010 --> 1:09:09.747
God, I hate you.

1:09:09.782 --> 1:09:12.981
That's okay.
I suck.

1:09:13.016 --> 1:09:16.721
Well, you took the fun
right out of that.

1:09:16.756 --> 1:09:19.988
Here, let me carry you
to bed, come on.

1:09:44.553 --> 1:09:46.850
Oh! Oh!

1:09:49.855 --> 1:09:52.295
Ow, why'd you kick me?

1:09:52.330 --> 1:09:53.923
She does that.

1:09:53.958 --> 1:09:57.498
- Why were you on the floor?
- I... I guess

1:09:57.533 --> 1:09:58.763
I didn't wanna wake
you guys up? I don't...

1:10:01.999 --> 1:10:03.768
- Hey, Dan.
- Yeah, brother?

1:10:03.803 --> 1:10:05.638
I'm sorry
about last night, man.

1:10:05.673 --> 1:10:08.278
No hard feelings, brother.
I'm sorry, too.

1:10:10.711 --> 1:10:12.909
"The lady of the house
requests your presence

1:10:12.944 --> 1:10:15.450
"in the grace garden
for a healing cacao ceremony

1:10:15.485 --> 1:10:17.320
at- 00 am."

1:10:17.355 --> 1:10:19.619
Why is she in our bed?

1:10:19.654 --> 1:10:21.720
I don't know, Jack, why?
Do you wanna fight her, too?

1:10:21.755 --> 1:10:23.458
No, I don't...

1:10:24.989 --> 1:10:28.859
Fuck!

1:10:28.894 --> 1:10:31.026
How do these people
fucking live like this?

1:10:31.061 --> 1:10:32.698
- It's--
- Jack--

1:10:32.733 --> 1:10:35.030
what the fuck happened
last night?

1:10:35.065 --> 1:10:37.472
Jack, grow the fuck up.

1:10:37.507 --> 1:10:39.408
You could've gone
to jail again.

1:10:39.443 --> 1:10:41.311
- I didn't go--
- I'm going to get coffee.

1:10:52.819 --> 1:10:54.555
Hi.

1:10:54.590 --> 1:10:56.590
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1:10:56.625 --> 1:10:58.856
Uh, listen, I...

1:10:58.891 --> 1:11:00.891
I just wanted to talk to you
about last night.

1:11:00.926 --> 1:11:04.796
I'm really sorry,
and I just...

1:11:04.831 --> 1:11:08.602
I don't know, I just feel
like it was so--

1:11:08.637 --> 1:11:10.604
Very avoidable.

1:11:10.639 --> 1:11:12.870
Um...

1:11:12.905 --> 1:11:15.477
yeah, yeah, I mean,
I... definitely

1:11:15.512 --> 1:11:17.347
could've talked
to Jack sooner.

1:11:17.382 --> 1:11:18.711
Or you could've
not told me.

1:11:20.451 --> 1:11:23.012
Right.

1:11:23.047 --> 1:11:25.454
There's an espresso
if you want coffee.

1:11:27.755 --> 1:11:29.722
Okay.

1:11:40.438 --> 1:11:41.932
What the fuck?

1:11:49.106 --> 1:11:52.547
Oh, goddamnit!

1:11:59.457 --> 1:12:01.589
You must be Lindz.

1:12:01.624 --> 1:12:04.020
I've heard about you.

1:12:04.055 --> 1:12:05.989
I'm sorry,
have we-- have we met?

1:12:06.024 --> 1:12:09.124
I'm Gigi.
Catherine's shaman.

1:12:09.159 --> 1:12:11.467
I'm really looking
forward to...

1:12:11.502 --> 1:12:13.436
healing together today.

1:12:18.168 --> 1:12:19.838
Mars...

1:12:19.873 --> 1:12:21.939
is the god of war.

1:12:21.974 --> 1:12:25.173
Scorpio is
the sign of the self.

1:12:27.617 --> 1:12:29.144
You're at war with yourself.

1:12:29.179 --> 1:12:32.719
- But...

1:12:32.754 --> 1:12:34.457
we can work on that together.

1:12:34.492 --> 1:12:35.920
Today.

1:12:48.803 --> 1:12:50.407
See you in the garden.

1:13:21.638 --> 1:13:24.067
I am incredibly honored
to be sitting with you all

1:13:24.102 --> 1:13:26.872
in intention today...

1:13:26.907 --> 1:13:28.643
at this cacao ceremony.

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:34.143
Please take a moment
to thank yourself...

1:13:34.178 --> 1:13:36.486
Thank you.

1:13:36.521 --> 1:13:37.949
And please
thank one another

1:13:37.984 --> 1:13:39.885
for sharing
this time together.

1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:43.724
Thank you.

1:13:43.759 --> 1:13:47.530
We are trying to connect
on a deeper level,

1:13:47.565 --> 1:13:49.191
on a human level,

1:13:49.226 --> 1:13:51.963
so we can see
each other.

1:13:51.998 --> 1:13:56.066
We have already created
our sacred space.

1:13:56.101 --> 1:13:59.575
We each have our own
individual bowls of cacao.

1:13:59.610 --> 1:14:01.137
Take a sip
of the cacao, please,

1:14:01.172 --> 1:14:02.974
as you're sitting
with your intention.

1:14:06.177 --> 1:14:10.146
This world is
such a crazy place.

1:14:10.181 --> 1:14:12.984
So... hectic.

1:14:13.019 --> 1:14:17.725
So... ego...ic.

1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:19.727
We spend all of this time

1:14:19.762 --> 1:14:22.224
traveling
through all these years,

1:14:22.259 --> 1:14:25.667
trying to get
to a certain place of hope,

1:14:25.702 --> 1:14:29.671
up this hill,
to a destination?

1:14:29.706 --> 1:14:32.201
And then we wake up
in the morning,

1:14:32.236 --> 1:14:35.105
and we step outside.

1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:36.876
We take a deep breath,

1:14:36.911 --> 1:14:39.714
or we just--
we get really high.

1:14:41.949 --> 1:14:44.686
When we want
to really be yelling,

1:14:44.721 --> 1:14:46.754
at the top of our lungs,

1:14:46.789 --> 1:14:50.626
"Hey!
What's going on?!"

1:14:50.661 --> 1:14:53.563
Wouldn't it be incredible

1:14:53.598 --> 1:14:56.225
if you could just turn
to your partner

1:14:56.260 --> 1:14:58.733
and say...

1:14:58.768 --> 1:15:01.197
"Do you know what I want?
What I really, really want?"

1:15:01.232 --> 1:15:03.199
And they could look at you,
and they would know

1:15:03.234 --> 1:15:05.168
exactly what you want,
what you really,

1:15:05.203 --> 1:15:07.709
really wanted,
because it's a safe space.

1:15:07.744 --> 1:15:09.645
And you could tell them,

1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:11.713
without any stuttering,
no "I want, uh,

1:15:11.748 --> 1:15:13.682
I may want, uh--"

1:15:13.717 --> 1:15:15.717
You know what you really,
really want.

1:15:15.752 --> 1:15:17.719
They know.

1:15:18.953 --> 1:15:21.349
You both want to be...

1:15:21.384 --> 1:15:23.725
friends.

1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:26.024
Possibly lovers.

1:15:27.797 --> 1:15:29.995
But you wanna be seen.

1:15:30.030 --> 1:15:32.030
Yes? Yes.

1:15:32.065 --> 1:15:33.603
- Yes.

1:15:35.398 --> 1:15:37.332
Please take another sip
of the cacao.

1:15:40.777 --> 1:15:42.645
Please repeat after me.

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:44.845
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:46.682
Please forgive me.

1:15:46.717 --> 1:15:49.311
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:15:49.346 --> 1:15:51.082
Please forgive me.

1:15:51.117 --> 1:15:54.723
I love you. I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

1:15:54.758 --> 1:15:57.154
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:15:57.189 --> 1:15:59.090
Please forgive me.

1:15:59.125 --> 1:16:03.160
I love you. I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

1:16:03.195 --> 1:16:06.130
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:16:06.165 --> 1:16:08.330
- Please forgive me.
- Again!

1:16:08.365 --> 1:16:10.838
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:16:10.873 --> 1:16:12.873
- Please forgive me.
- Again!

1:16:12.908 --> 1:16:15.073
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:16:15.108 --> 1:16:16.371
Please forgive me.

1:16:17.946 --> 1:16:21.013
Thank you.

1:16:21.048 --> 1:16:23.345
Now that we are done
with the cacao ceremony,

1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:25.985
I would like to invite
you all to take a moment

1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:28.757
to dance with me
in intention.

1:16:40.166 --> 1:16:41.968
Yes.

1:16:42.003 --> 1:16:44.300
Think about your heart.

1:16:44.335 --> 1:16:46.302
What is it feeling?
Is it a give?

1:16:46.337 --> 1:16:48.304
Is it a take?
Are you taking too much?

1:16:48.339 --> 1:16:50.207
Do not be shy.

1:16:50.242 --> 1:16:52.044
Explore what love
means for you.

1:16:52.079 --> 1:16:55.685
Nothing is wrong,
everything is right.

1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:58.182
We're not dancing,
love is moving us.

1:16:58.217 --> 1:16:59.986
Incredible.

1:17:00.021 --> 1:17:01.889
Powerful group here.

1:17:01.924 --> 1:17:04.760
Be intentional.
This is what I wanna see.

1:17:04.795 --> 1:17:07.224
Are you guys feeling this?
I am just so overcome

1:17:07.259 --> 1:17:10.392
with the whirlwind of love

1:17:39.929 --> 1:17:41.995
Mmm...

1:17:42.030 --> 1:17:44.261
so, let's continue.

1:17:44.296 --> 1:17:46.098
From the front
of the house are...

1:17:46.133 --> 1:17:47.935
- The pinot.
- Pinot which?

1:17:47.970 --> 1:17:49.299
- Noir.
- Good.

1:17:49.334 --> 1:17:51.202
Good, good, good.

1:17:51.237 --> 1:17:52.874
And what's
behind the house?

1:17:52.909 --> 1:17:54.403
- The shiraz.
- Very close.

1:17:54.438 --> 1:17:56.108
It's actually syrah.

1:17:56.143 --> 1:17:57.505
But you know
what's kind of funny?

1:17:57.540 --> 1:17:59.408
- It's the same thing.
- What?

1:17:59.443 --> 1:18:01.146
Shiraz is just...

1:18:01.181 --> 1:18:03.049
Australian syrah,
but the French don't like

1:18:03.084 --> 1:18:04.512
the Australians,
so they were like,

1:18:04.547 --> 1:18:06.217
no, you can--

1:18:06.252 --> 1:18:08.351
you can call it "syrah,"
and they were like,

1:18:08.386 --> 1:18:10.023
"Well, what do we call it?"

1:18:10.058 --> 1:18:11.860
And they were like,
"You call it

1:18:11.895 --> 1:18:13.290
whatever you want,
but not syrah,"

1:18:13.325 --> 1:18:15.457
and they were like,
"Fine, we'll...

1:18:15.492 --> 1:18:17.261
we'll call it shiraz."

1:18:21.300 --> 1:18:23.399
It's the same thing
as sauvi B and Saint Cyr,

1:18:23.434 --> 1:18:25.071
it's just a marketing
question, you know?

1:18:25.106 --> 1:18:27.370
Yeah...

1:18:27.405 --> 1:18:29.977
- Oh, man.
- You are great, man.

1:18:30.012 --> 1:18:32.144
- Thanks, man.
- No, like,

1:18:32.179 --> 1:18:34.509
I cannot wait
to get to know you better.

1:18:34.544 --> 1:18:36.478
When are we gonna do that?

1:18:36.513 --> 1:18:38.986
You know, with Cat
and Lindsay working together,

1:18:39.021 --> 1:18:40.284
we may hang out
all the time.

1:18:40.319 --> 1:18:42.792
- They are?
- Yeah, remember?

1:18:42.827 --> 1:18:44.794
At brunch, she said
you'd fund the thing.

1:18:44.829 --> 1:18:47.896
Oh, my God, so much has
happened this weekend.

1:18:47.931 --> 1:18:49.524
- I know.
- What's the company?

1:18:49.559 --> 1:18:51.361
Sustainable
clothing something.

1:18:51.396 --> 1:18:53.902
Oh, that's a pretty good idea.

1:18:53.937 --> 1:18:55.200
Can I hit you
with a truth bomb?

1:18:55.235 --> 1:18:56.498
Blow it up.

1:18:56.533 --> 1:18:58.236
Don't let Lindz...

1:18:58.271 --> 1:19:00.040
get involved with Cat.

1:19:00.075 --> 1:19:02.306
And don't-- And don't
you get involved

1:19:02.341 --> 1:19:04.011
with Cat, either.

1:19:04.046 --> 1:19:06.211
- Why?

1:19:07.984 --> 1:19:09.544
Cat is my wife

1:19:09.579 --> 1:19:12.217
and my raison d'etre

1:19:12.252 --> 1:19:15.154
and my light
and my path forward,

1:19:15.189 --> 1:19:17.057
and all of that,
so if she ever hears

1:19:17.092 --> 1:19:18.520
that I said this,
I will deny it to the hill,

1:19:18.555 --> 1:19:20.126
then I'll say
that you were fucked up

1:19:20.161 --> 1:19:22.293
and made it up, but...

1:19:22.328 --> 1:19:24.394
Cat's kind of a...

1:19:24.429 --> 1:19:27.936
an experience hoarder.

1:19:27.971 --> 1:19:31.368
And she loves to feel
like a patron

1:19:31.403 --> 1:19:33.502
of the arts.

1:19:33.537 --> 1:19:37.913
Like a de' Medici from Italy
in the Renaissance,

1:19:37.948 --> 1:19:39.475
but this is
the problem, right?

1:19:39.510 --> 1:19:42.511
Is that she holds on
to these experiences,

1:19:42.546 --> 1:19:44.117
and if you try to take 'em
away, she's like,

1:19:44.152 --> 1:19:46.251
"No! This is my stuff!"

1:19:48.090 --> 1:19:49.518
And she forgets
that there's people

1:19:49.553 --> 1:19:51.256
on the other end
of those experiences,

1:19:51.291 --> 1:19:54.193
and those people inevitably
end up on the...

1:19:54.228 --> 1:19:57.262
on the trash pile
of her hoard.

1:19:57.297 --> 1:20:00.529
And I don't want that
to happen to you and Lindz.

1:20:00.564 --> 1:20:02.399
I mean, just--
let me just-- let me just

1:20:02.434 --> 1:20:04.104
throw something out at you
here, do you know that,

1:20:04.139 --> 1:20:05.974
last year,
I was funding

1:20:06.009 --> 1:20:08.339
three nonprofit
theater companies in Astoria,

1:20:08.374 --> 1:20:10.979
one alpaca farm
in Argentina...

1:20:12.411 --> 1:20:16.083
and two equestrian academies

1:20:16.118 --> 1:20:18.349
in Atlanta and Austin,

1:20:18.384 --> 1:20:20.021
and that--
that was just because

1:20:20.056 --> 1:20:21.616
she liked the A sounds
back to back.

1:20:21.651 --> 1:20:23.453
- It's called assonance.
- Really?

1:20:23.488 --> 1:20:24.960
Yeah.

1:20:26.458 --> 1:20:29.162
Fuck, there is a word
for everything.

1:20:30.132 --> 1:20:32.902
But this is
what I'm saying, okay?

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:36.906
Cat doesn't follow through.

1:20:36.941 --> 1:20:39.271
All of those businesses
I just mentioned?

1:20:40.670 --> 1:20:42.340
Guess where they are.

1:20:43.706 --> 1:20:47.543
- I don't know.

1:20:47.578 --> 1:20:49.347
That-- That's them
not existing.

1:20:49.382 --> 1:20:51.514
They don't exist anymore.
They all went under

1:20:51.549 --> 1:20:53.351
because Cat got bored
with them.

1:20:54.420 --> 1:20:55.958
Yeah.

1:20:58.259 --> 1:21:00.358
Cat thinks
I lack compassion.

1:21:02.296 --> 1:21:04.560
But she only thinks that

1:21:04.595 --> 1:21:07.035
because I make
so much money.

1:21:07.070 --> 1:21:09.169
Just because
I make a lot of money

1:21:09.204 --> 1:21:11.534
does not therefore mean
I lack compassion, right?

1:21:13.703 --> 1:21:15.505
Right, Jack?
I need you to say "right."

1:21:15.540 --> 1:21:19.212
- Yeah, right, no.

1:21:19.247 --> 1:21:22.149
My biggest fear is that

1:21:22.184 --> 1:21:24.019
Cat's only with me
because I make

1:21:24.054 --> 1:21:26.384
such a fuckton of money.

1:21:26.419 --> 1:21:28.485
- Fuck.
- Does that sound

1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:30.190
like somebody
who lacks compassion?

1:21:30.225 --> 1:21:33.556
No, I think you feel
a lot of stuff.

1:21:33.591 --> 1:21:36.262
Thank you.
Thank you, yes.

1:21:36.297 --> 1:21:38.000
- I do.
- Can I--

1:21:38.035 --> 1:21:39.298
Can I tell you something?

1:21:39.333 --> 1:21:41.003
God, I wish you would.

1:21:42.666 --> 1:21:44.336
I'm afraid Lindsay's
gonna leave me

1:21:44.371 --> 1:21:46.569
because I don't
make enough money.

1:21:46.604 --> 1:21:48.373
That's like
the yin to my yang.

1:21:48.408 --> 1:21:50.210
She wants me
to ask you about a job.

1:21:50.245 --> 1:21:52.014
Do you want a job?

1:21:52.049 --> 1:21:53.411
I don't know,
doing what?

1:21:53.446 --> 1:21:55.116
Well, what do you wanna do?

1:22:00.354 --> 1:22:02.255
I don't know what I wanna do.

1:22:06.294 --> 1:22:08.492
Then why would
I have a job for you, my man?

1:22:10.298 --> 1:22:11.726
You know?

1:22:14.368 --> 1:22:18.238
My advice--
My advice, Jack,

1:22:18.273 --> 1:22:20.537
you just-- you figure out
what you wanna do.

1:22:22.145 --> 1:22:24.145
And you go do it.

1:22:24.180 --> 1:22:26.114
We're not
really silly anymore.

1:22:26.149 --> 1:22:29.051
We're not silly people.
We're so serious.

1:22:29.086 --> 1:22:31.020
Daniel,
I'm sorry,

1:22:31.055 --> 1:22:33.187
but your-- your fingers
feel like worms,

1:22:33.222 --> 1:22:35.024
and if we just take
a quick little break--

1:22:35.059 --> 1:22:37.389
I feel like I'm getting
buried in the dirt.

1:22:37.424 --> 1:22:40.194
- Absolutely.
- Thanks, Becca.

1:22:40.229 --> 1:22:44.198
- Ugh, Lindz...
- Hmm?

1:22:44.233 --> 1:22:47.036
not to be serious, but...

1:22:47.071 --> 1:22:48.301
we gotta talk
about the line.

1:22:48.336 --> 1:22:50.765
Yes.

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:53.273
Okay, okay:
local, sustainable.

1:22:53.308 --> 1:22:55.737
Local, sustainable,
and, yeah, I'm, like,

1:22:55.772 --> 1:22:59.642
I'm thinking about, like,
textures and patterns.

1:22:59.677 --> 1:23:02.678
- Mm.
- And... choreography

1:23:02.713 --> 1:23:05.186
and rhythms and emotions
and thoughts.

1:23:05.221 --> 1:23:07.782
Well, hemp is overdone.

1:23:07.817 --> 1:23:09.553
- Completely.
- Mm-hmm.

1:23:09.588 --> 1:23:11.456
- Couldn't agree more.
- Something strong.

1:23:11.491 --> 1:23:14.822
Yeah, strong like, um...

1:23:14.857 --> 1:23:17.264
- trees-- mm.
- Mm.

1:23:17.299 --> 1:23:18.826
Could we make it
out of bark?

1:23:18.861 --> 1:23:21.103
I don't know that
I've seen that done before.

1:23:21.138 --> 1:23:23.303
Mm-mm... hmm.

1:23:23.338 --> 1:23:25.074
You're right, yeah,
no, that's a--

1:23:25.109 --> 1:23:26.570
- that's a bad idea.

1:23:26.605 --> 1:23:28.407
That one was
the mushrooms.

1:23:28.442 --> 1:23:29.639
- I may have gotten

1:23:29.674 --> 1:23:31.311
too much mushrooms.

1:23:31.346 --> 1:23:34.314
- Too much mushrooms.
- Too much.

1:23:34.349 --> 1:23:35.711
- Wait, what?
- Too much.

1:23:35.746 --> 1:23:38.714
We were supposed
to micro-dose.

1:23:38.749 --> 1:23:41.090
- Micro-dose?
- Mm, yeah.

1:23:41.125 --> 1:23:42.784
That's where you do, like,
a little bit of...

1:23:42.819 --> 1:23:44.720
a little bit of mushrooms
over a sustained period

1:23:44.755 --> 1:23:46.359
so you--
you don't get, like,

1:23:46.394 --> 1:23:48.427
super fucked-up,
you just become, sort of,

1:23:48.462 --> 1:23:50.297
enlightened and...

1:23:50.332 --> 1:23:53.234
We all micro-dosed
on mushrooms?

1:23:53.269 --> 1:23:55.335
- Yes.
- When?

1:23:55.370 --> 1:23:59.735
Um... since
dinner on Friday.

1:23:59.770 --> 1:24:02.705
So, all weekend?

1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:06.775
Well, I don't...
no, not, like, all weekend.

1:24:06.810 --> 1:24:08.843
- Friday?
- It was...

1:24:08.878 --> 1:24:10.548
in the mung bean bowls
on Friday,

1:24:10.583 --> 1:24:12.418
and then the...

1:24:12.453 --> 1:24:15.355
the bloody marys
and the BBQ.

1:24:15.390 --> 1:24:17.324
- And today?
- And just now

1:24:17.359 --> 1:24:19.227
- at the cacao.
- So all weekend.

1:24:21.462 --> 1:24:23.561
- Lindz...

1:24:23.596 --> 1:24:25.497
How dare you.

1:24:25.532 --> 1:24:27.697
- How dare you incept

1:24:27.732 --> 1:24:29.897
my mind with your time?

1:24:29.932 --> 1:24:32.438
What is...
time is crazy.

1:24:32.473 --> 1:24:34.176
Oh, my God.

1:24:34.211 --> 1:24:36.211
Sorry I didn't
even realize that

1:24:36.246 --> 1:24:38.345
we were at the end
of the weekend.

1:24:38.380 --> 1:24:40.578
- We're on drugs?
- Oh, I feel bad.

1:24:40.613 --> 1:24:43.218
Yes.

1:24:43.253 --> 1:24:45.418
- We are.
- Oh, my God, no.

1:24:45.453 --> 1:24:46.881
I'm having a bad moment.

1:24:46.916 --> 1:24:48.652
Oh, no-no-no,
no-no-no.

1:24:48.687 --> 1:24:51.160
Let's "sprin"--
spin this straw into gold.

1:24:51.195 --> 1:24:53.525
No, Jack said
we couldn't do drugs.

1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:56.264
Jack said we couldn't do--
Jack can't do drugs.

1:24:56.299 --> 1:24:58.167
He actually can do them
pretty well.

1:24:58.202 --> 1:25:00.433
No, no, like,
he can't do them, like,

1:25:00.468 --> 1:25:02.402
he gets drug tested.

1:25:03.768 --> 1:25:06.340
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1:25:06.375 --> 1:25:08.672
- What a twist.

1:25:08.707 --> 1:25:10.476
No, no--
don't worry about it,

1:25:10.511 --> 1:25:12.907
Gigi has a guy that's--
it'll all get sorted out.

1:25:12.942 --> 1:25:14.843
- We'll take care of it.
- Oh, my God, no,

1:25:14.878 --> 1:25:17.285
but he has a guy,
he has a-- he has a guy,

1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:19.320
his name is Doug,
and it's his officer.

1:25:19.355 --> 1:25:22.191
It's his-- It's his...
"he's in trouble" person.

1:25:22.226 --> 1:25:23.621
He has to make sure
he's not in trouble.

1:25:23.656 --> 1:25:25.524
He--

1:25:25.559 --> 1:25:28.329
Doug is so irrelevant
in this story.

1:25:28.364 --> 1:25:30.694
I can't even--
I can't even tell you

1:25:30.729 --> 1:25:32.960
how much you don't have
to worry about Doug.

1:25:32.995 --> 1:25:35.237
I don't understand,
and the bad feeling is

1:25:35.272 --> 1:25:37.206
- not going away.
- No-no-no-no-no.

1:25:37.241 --> 1:25:40.275
We're above that-- in fact,
we were doing ayahuasca

1:25:40.310 --> 1:25:42.376
with Elon and Grimes

1:25:42.411 --> 1:25:44.213
right before
they had the baby,

1:25:44.248 --> 1:25:46.974
- A-Ash-12-17-50,000...
- I think...

1:25:47.009 --> 1:25:48.844
I think I--
I need to go.

1:25:48.879 --> 1:25:50.417
- Jackie.
- Oh, my God.

1:25:50.452 --> 1:25:51.781
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:25:51.816 --> 1:25:53.453
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah,

1:25:53.488 --> 1:25:55.323
Doug, yeah,
this is not a thing.

1:26:28.457 --> 1:26:29.852
Are you feeling okay?

1:26:32.054 --> 1:26:34.989
Yeah, no,
I just-- I'm...

1:26:35.024 --> 1:26:36.496
I'm, like, dehydrated

1:26:36.531 --> 1:26:38.267
or... something.

1:26:38.302 --> 1:26:40.962
Honestly, I've felt off,
like, all day.

1:26:40.997 --> 1:26:42.865
It's been...

1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.636
yeah, it's been
an emotional day.

1:26:46.310 --> 1:26:49.839
That's... That's
an understatement, yeah.

1:26:49.874 --> 1:26:52.512
- Um... I...
- So...

1:26:55.077 --> 1:26:57.319
- No, did you...
- No, what were you gonna say?

1:26:57.354 --> 1:26:58.881
- You wanna?
- No, what were you gonna say?

1:26:58.916 --> 1:27:00.454
- You sure?
- Yeah, no, go.

1:27:02.359 --> 1:27:04.491
Yeah, okay,
I was... you know,

1:27:04.526 --> 1:27:05.921
I was hanging out
with Matt by the pool,

1:27:05.956 --> 1:27:07.725
and we were--
we were talking.

1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:09.694
Oh, my gosh, were you guys
talking about work?

1:27:09.729 --> 1:27:12.367
In a very-- yeah, like,
in a roundabout way.

1:27:12.402 --> 1:27:14.996
Jack!
That's incredible.

1:27:15.031 --> 1:27:17.966
You working with Matt,
and me working with Cat.

1:27:18.001 --> 1:27:21.343
This is...
This is really exciting.

1:27:21.378 --> 1:27:22.938
Like, this could
actually happen.

1:27:22.973 --> 1:27:25.545
This-- This could be our life.

1:27:27.450 --> 1:27:29.285
Right?

1:27:32.114 --> 1:27:34.719
Look, this--
this isn't real, though.

1:27:34.754 --> 1:27:37.722
Okay, Jack,
this is the thing, though.

1:27:37.757 --> 1:27:40.725
This is the thing that you do
when you are not accepting

1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:42.595
an invitation to upgrade

1:27:42.630 --> 1:27:44.498
because you're scared
to take a leap.

1:27:44.533 --> 1:27:46.467
I don't know what you're
talking about right now.

1:27:46.502 --> 1:27:49.470
I just...
wanna do it

1:27:49.505 --> 1:27:51.538
my way,
for once.

1:27:51.573 --> 1:27:53.474
Um, taking money
from a stranger

1:27:53.509 --> 1:27:54.871
isn't doing it your way.

1:27:54.906 --> 1:27:56.840
She's not a stranger.

1:27:56.875 --> 1:28:00.415
I'm kind of offended that
you think it's taking money.

1:28:00.450 --> 1:28:02.417
She's investing in me.

1:28:02.452 --> 1:28:04.518
She believes in me.

1:28:04.553 --> 1:28:07.818
Could you try maybe
taking a note from Cat?

1:28:07.853 --> 1:28:09.853
Maybe a, "Hey, Lindsay,
you're really talented.

1:28:09.888 --> 1:28:11.657
"Hey, I would love
to support you.

1:28:11.692 --> 1:28:13.120
"Hey, I think
you're worth it.

1:28:13.155 --> 1:28:15.331
Hey, this could be
really good for us."

1:28:18.699 --> 1:28:21.865
No, okay. Okay.

1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:23.537
- Lindsay?
- No, it's fine.

1:28:23.572 --> 1:28:26.100
Lindsay? Lindsay?

1:28:26.135 --> 1:28:28.707
I love you.
We don't know them.

1:28:28.742 --> 1:28:30.577
And you don't know
how to run a business,

1:28:30.612 --> 1:28:32.480
so getting into business
with these people,

1:28:32.515 --> 1:28:34.075
it's like--
that's a terrible idea.

1:28:34.110 --> 1:28:35.945
You are not...

1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:38.552
physically, mentally,

1:28:38.587 --> 1:28:40.785
and emotionally capable
of running a business.

1:28:40.820 --> 1:28:43.084
I'm not either, so, like,
taking money from someone--

1:28:43.119 --> 1:28:44.657
Hey, Jack?

1:28:46.463 --> 1:28:47.990
Please stop.

1:28:55.736 --> 1:28:57.032
Dinner's almost ready.

1:28:57.067 --> 1:28:59.408
- Great, thank you.
- Great.

1:28:59.443 --> 1:29:02.070
You guys doing good?
You look great.

1:29:02.105 --> 1:29:03.973
- Thanks, see you at dinner.
- Okay.

1:29:04.008 --> 1:29:05.480
Okay, I wasn't listening.

1:29:05.515 --> 1:29:07.581
No, but the really

1:29:07.616 --> 1:29:08.978
fucked-up thing is,
do you know how much

1:29:09.013 --> 1:29:10.716
I paid Dan this year?

1:29:10.751 --> 1:29:13.554
Like, $250,000.

1:29:13.589 --> 1:29:15.556
And that's on top
of his salary.

1:29:15.591 --> 1:29:17.657
- That's not the salary.

1:29:17.692 --> 1:29:20.759
Milton's asked that
we all meet down at the barn

1:29:20.794 --> 1:29:22.728
for the weekend finale.

1:29:22.763 --> 1:29:25.830
But, hey-- hey, hey!

1:29:25.865 --> 1:29:29.669
But first I just want
to quickly express again

1:29:29.704 --> 1:29:33.739
my deep and sincere
appreciation

1:29:33.774 --> 1:29:36.709
to each
and every one of you

1:29:36.744 --> 1:29:38.744
for opening
yourselves up to...

1:29:38.779 --> 1:29:40.515
- Blah-blah-blah-blah...
- ...to each other.

1:29:40.550 --> 1:29:43.078
- Let's get weird!
- Let's get it!

1:29:43.113 --> 1:29:44.717
Fuck it,
let's get weird, Carrie.

1:29:44.752 --> 1:29:46.015
Let's fucking get weird.

1:30:04.607 --> 1:30:07.036
Everybody put
your fucking headphones on!

1:30:28.059 --> 1:30:29.828
Why do you look so bored?

1:30:29.863 --> 1:30:31.533
Ugh, I'm not bored,
I'm just...

1:30:31.568 --> 1:30:32.996
Drink.

1:30:33.031 --> 1:30:34.261
I can't drink champagne
right now.

1:30:34.296 --> 1:30:35.999
Just have
a glass of champagne.

1:30:36.034 --> 1:30:37.770
I don't wanna
drink champagne right now.

1:30:37.805 --> 1:30:39.607
Please, just one,
it'll be the best night ever.

1:30:39.642 --> 1:30:41.774
I'm sorry, I just--
I'm so mad at Jack right now.

1:30:41.809 --> 1:30:43.204
If you don't have
one glass of champagne,

1:30:43.239 --> 1:30:46.174
I will literally
kill myself.

1:30:46.209 --> 1:30:48.176
I swear to God, I will jump
right out of that window

1:30:48.211 --> 1:30:50.849
like the Kool-Aid Man.

1:30:50.884 --> 1:30:53.687
I will eat an entire box
of Tide Pods.

1:30:53.722 --> 1:30:55.953
I will drink
an entire bottle of bleach.

1:30:55.988 --> 1:30:57.757
Daniel, hit me
with the bleach!

1:30:57.792 --> 1:30:59.594
It's happening.

1:30:59.629 --> 1:31:01.959
I will drink a sip.

1:31:01.994 --> 1:31:03.763
Good girl.

1:31:07.736 --> 1:31:09.604
That a baby!

1:31:09.639 --> 1:31:12.068
Let's show these fuckers
how to dance!

1:32:01.757 --> 1:32:03.790
- Hi.
- Hey.

1:32:03.825 --> 1:32:05.990
- Could I get a water?
- Yeah!

1:32:06.025 --> 1:32:07.695
Take those headphones off.

1:32:07.730 --> 1:32:09.829
- Oh--

1:32:09.864 --> 1:32:11.930
- can I get a water?
- Yeah.

1:32:11.965 --> 1:32:14.097
- There you go.
- Wow, you are flying.

1:32:16.002 --> 1:32:17.870
Mmm.

1:32:20.941 --> 1:32:22.974
You guys are
really feeling it already.

1:32:24.208 --> 1:32:26.109
- Yeah.
- They wanted us to break

1:32:26.144 --> 1:32:27.847
the pills in half,
but they were just...

1:32:27.882 --> 1:32:29.816
too hard, so we just
plopped them right in.

1:32:29.851 --> 1:32:32.687
What?

1:32:32.722 --> 1:32:34.084
- The pills.
- In the champagne.

1:32:34.119 --> 1:32:35.723
Yeah, double-stack
Cadillacs.

1:32:35.758 --> 1:32:38.055
- Waah!

1:32:40.697 --> 1:32:42.631
- Oh, shit.
- Uh-oh.

1:32:42.666 --> 1:32:43.929
Okay.

1:32:43.964 --> 1:32:45.799
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:32:47.132 --> 1:32:50.364
Hi, hi...

1:32:50.399 --> 1:32:53.675
...that is wild.

1:32:53.710 --> 1:32:55.237
Uh-huh.
Hey, can I talk--

1:32:55.272 --> 1:32:56.711
can I talk to you
for a second?

1:32:56.746 --> 1:32:59.109
Yeah, let's...
let's connect.

1:32:59.144 --> 1:33:01.650
- Okay.
- You are so soft.

1:33:01.685 --> 1:33:02.948
- Oh, thank you.
- Your skin is so soft.

1:33:02.983 --> 1:33:04.719
We don't touch enough.

1:33:04.754 --> 1:33:06.314
- I know.
- We used to touch more.

1:33:06.349 --> 1:33:08.019
- I love you too.
- I love you so much.

1:33:08.054 --> 1:33:09.284
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

1:33:09.319 --> 1:33:10.351
- I feel amazing--
- Hey, Jack?

1:33:10.386 --> 1:33:11.924
--right now, yes, Lindsay.

1:33:11.959 --> 1:33:13.156
- I know.
- I feel amazing, I love--

1:33:13.191 --> 1:33:14.861
- Listen to me.
- Yeah.

1:33:14.896 --> 1:33:16.159
That's because
we're on molly.

1:33:16.194 --> 1:33:17.864
What?

1:33:17.899 --> 1:33:19.668
It was in the champagne.

1:33:19.703 --> 1:33:21.736
We were also
on mushrooms all day.

1:33:21.771 --> 1:33:23.969
- What?!
- Yeah, it was in the cacao.

1:33:24.004 --> 1:33:25.740
- The chocolate?
- Uh-huh.

1:33:25.775 --> 1:33:27.907
And a couple
of other things.

1:33:29.438 --> 1:33:31.878
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Just breathe.

1:33:31.913 --> 1:33:33.781
- I can't do drugs.
- No, I think it's a little

1:33:33.816 --> 1:33:35.684
- too late, though.

1:33:35.719 --> 1:33:37.081
All of these people
drugged us?

1:33:37.116 --> 1:33:39.314
Fuck them!
Fuck them so fucking hard!

1:33:39.349 --> 1:33:41.217
- Fuck you!
- Jack!

1:33:41.252 --> 1:33:43.153
I need you
to calm down, okay?

1:33:43.188 --> 1:33:44.726
- You need to breathe.
- Okay.

1:33:44.761 --> 1:33:46.321
I see the dragon coming.

1:33:46.356 --> 1:33:48.026
And I want you
to stay with me,

1:33:48.061 --> 1:33:49.456
and I want you to look
in me, in my eyes.

1:33:49.491 --> 1:33:52.195
Okay? I told her
that you can't do drugs.

1:33:52.230 --> 1:33:53.900
- I can't do drugs.
- And it's okay

1:33:53.935 --> 1:33:55.396
- because Cat has a guy.
- Cat has a guy,

1:33:55.431 --> 1:33:57.134
- Yeah.
- Well, I mean,

1:33:57.169 --> 1:33:58.839
it's not Cat's guy,
it's-- Gigi has a guy.

1:33:58.874 --> 1:34:00.269
And there's
something about Elon.

1:34:00.304 --> 1:34:01.974
- Elon?
- Yeah.

1:34:02.009 --> 1:34:03.371
It's okay because
she has a podcast--

1:34:03.406 --> 1:34:05.109
A-- what the fuck are
you talking about

1:34:05.144 --> 1:34:06.979
- right now?
- No, listen to me, I'm just--

1:34:07.014 --> 1:34:08.783
these people do this,
it's like, it happens

1:34:08.818 --> 1:34:10.378
in little doses,
and listen,

1:34:10.413 --> 1:34:13.018
I just need everything
to be cool because--

1:34:13.053 --> 1:34:15.449
Well, I can't be cool
right now, Lindsey,

1:34:15.484 --> 1:34:17.253
I'm on drugs,
I can't be cool right now!

1:34:17.288 --> 1:34:18.991
Okay, please--
please stop yelling.

1:34:19.026 --> 1:34:21.191
- You're making a scene.
- I'm sorry that

1:34:21.226 --> 1:34:23.061
I'm making a scene in front
of these fucking people

1:34:23.096 --> 1:34:24.832
who are trying
to ruin our lives.

1:34:24.867 --> 1:34:26.196
- Oh, my God.
- These fucking people

1:34:26.231 --> 1:34:27.736
you've known
for ten fucking days!

1:34:27.771 --> 1:34:29.397
These people?
These people? Jack,

1:34:29.432 --> 1:34:31.333
Jesus Christ, are you even
listening to yourself?

1:34:31.368 --> 1:34:33.434
You just keep
repeating yourself,

1:34:33.469 --> 1:34:35.744
over and over
and over again!

1:34:35.779 --> 1:34:38.010
You keep saying
the same stupid shit,

1:34:38.045 --> 1:34:40.947
and you keep wearing
the same stupid shit,

1:34:40.982 --> 1:34:42.410
and you keep
watching the same

1:34:42.445 --> 1:34:44.082
stupid shit,
and you keep being this...

1:34:44.117 --> 1:34:46.216
shitty version
of yourself,

1:34:46.251 --> 1:34:47.822
and I keep waiting
for you to change,

1:34:47.857 --> 1:34:49.219
and you're not changing,
and I just--

1:34:49.254 --> 1:34:50.957
I understand
that you fell down,

1:34:50.992 --> 1:34:52.453
and I just need you--
I need you

1:34:52.488 --> 1:34:53.960
to get back up, okay?

1:34:53.995 --> 1:34:55.225
And I know
that you blame me.

1:34:55.260 --> 1:34:56.864
- I don't blame you...
- You do.

1:34:56.899 --> 1:34:57.766
- I don't blame you.
- Listen to me.

1:34:57.801 --> 1:34:59.262
I understand

1:34:59.297 --> 1:35:01.198
that you're angry,
but I need you

1:35:01.233 --> 1:35:03.035
to get back up.

1:35:03.070 --> 1:35:04.905
Because this person
believes in me.

1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:06.940
- Cat believes in you?
- Yes.

1:35:06.975 --> 1:35:08.271
I don't believe in you
but Cat believes in you?

1:35:08.306 --> 1:35:10.405
We're here because
your friend Cat

1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:12.242
- believes in you? Yeah?
- Yes, Jack!

1:35:12.277 --> 1:35:13.914
She is my friend.
Why else would we be here?

1:35:13.949 --> 1:35:17.115
Because they're
fucking rich, Lindsay.

1:35:17.150 --> 1:35:19.282
That's it.
They beckoned.

1:35:19.317 --> 1:35:22.087
We fucking came, okay?
And your friend Cat?

1:35:22.122 --> 1:35:24.221
You just wanna be her.

1:35:24.256 --> 1:35:26.388
She fucking sucks.

1:35:26.423 --> 1:35:28.192
She's mean,
and she's manipulative,

1:35:28.227 --> 1:35:30.260
and she's a fucking bully,
and these people--

1:35:30.295 --> 1:35:32.130
they're not your friends.

1:35:32.165 --> 1:35:33.901
All right?
We are entertainment to them.

1:35:33.936 --> 1:35:35.496
They think the way
we live our life is funny.

1:35:35.531 --> 1:35:37.806
They think the way I dress
is fucking funny.

1:35:37.841 --> 1:35:40.875
Okay? I understand
that I am not

1:35:40.910 --> 1:35:42.305
giving you
what you want in life,

1:35:42.340 --> 1:35:45.143
and I'm sorry,
but, like,

1:35:45.178 --> 1:35:47.541
- this isn't us.

1:35:47.576 --> 1:35:50.214
We are not gonna have
this life ever.

1:35:53.956 --> 1:35:56.022
Well, then maybe
I don't want our life anymore.

1:35:58.224 --> 1:36:01.324
No, no, no.
What does that mean?

1:36:03.031 --> 1:36:04.525
I don't know.

1:36:06.397 --> 1:36:08.265
No, I love you.
These people don't love you.

1:36:08.300 --> 1:36:09.563
I love you.
I love you.

1:36:09.598 --> 1:36:11.235
- Jack.
- I love you.

1:36:11.270 --> 1:36:13.600
- Look at me, I love you.
- I hear you.

1:36:13.635 --> 1:36:17.241
But you were
just yelling at me.

1:36:17.276 --> 1:36:19.914
And I'm going outside.

1:36:19.949 --> 1:36:22.114
Lindsay.

1:36:22.149 --> 1:36:24.248
Savage, bro.

1:36:24.283 --> 1:36:26.580
Fuck you, Kerry.

1:36:26.615 --> 1:36:29.220
That's fair.

1:36:29.255 --> 1:36:34.159
♪ Happy Birthday to me ♪

1:36:36.229 --> 1:36:38.493
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1:36:38.528 --> 1:36:40.528
I am so sorry.
I am so embarrassed.

1:36:40.563 --> 1:36:42.233
I am mortified,
Jack just...

1:36:42.268 --> 1:36:44.136
- Oh, Lindz, Lindsay--
- I can't believe

1:36:44.171 --> 1:36:46.501
- he said those things.
- I-- honestly, I loved it.

1:36:46.536 --> 1:36:48.503
I loved it.

1:36:48.538 --> 1:36:50.879
- What?
- Nobody ever has

1:36:50.914 --> 1:36:53.343
the balls to talk to me
like that.

1:36:53.378 --> 1:36:56.247
Like, we pay them too much.

1:36:58.482 --> 1:37:01.153
Even Matt is
terrified of me,

1:37:01.188 --> 1:37:04.486
which I love.

1:37:04.521 --> 1:37:06.587
But it also makes me sad.

1:37:09.295 --> 1:37:12.065
But, like, I'm not
the only one who's sad

1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:13.528
and fucked up,
you know?

1:37:13.563 --> 1:37:16.531
Like, I-- yeah,
I'm an alcoholic.

1:37:16.566 --> 1:37:18.940
My husband's a workaholic.

1:37:18.975 --> 1:37:20.469
Your husband is insecure.

1:37:20.504 --> 1:37:22.944
You lack purpose.

1:37:24.112 --> 1:37:26.079
But so do I, that's...

1:37:26.114 --> 1:37:28.279
that's why
I'm an alcoholic.

1:37:28.314 --> 1:37:30.149
It gives me
something to do.

1:37:30.184 --> 1:37:33.251
- No.
- We're like a clown car

1:37:33.286 --> 1:37:36.122
on the way
to a Chris Gaines concert.

1:37:36.157 --> 1:37:37.585
- No.
- Look at us.

1:37:37.620 --> 1:37:39.994
No-- no!

1:37:40.029 --> 1:37:41.391
It's like,
God, I just...

1:37:41.426 --> 1:37:43.063
I just wanted
not to be us for,

1:37:43.098 --> 1:37:44.966
like, a minute.

1:37:45.001 --> 1:37:48.167
- Do you know what I mean?
- How'd that go?

1:37:48.202 --> 1:37:50.103
- My husband's

1:37:50.138 --> 1:37:52.435
rolling his face off,
and he just screamed at me.

1:37:52.470 --> 1:37:55.944
I saw that.
I loved that.

1:37:55.979 --> 1:37:57.605
For me-- not--
I didn't love that for you.

1:37:57.640 --> 1:37:59.948
That must have been
really embarrassing.

1:37:59.983 --> 1:38:01.510
- Yeah.
- Gosh.

1:38:01.545 --> 1:38:03.644
It was.

1:38:04.988 --> 1:38:06.680
I'm...

1:38:06.715 --> 1:38:08.990
I'm trying to work
on my empathy.

1:38:09.025 --> 1:38:11.157
Did I pass the test?

1:38:12.996 --> 1:38:14.622
Hey, sorry
that you thought that

1:38:14.657 --> 1:38:16.723
I had an answer
or something--

1:38:16.758 --> 1:38:20.166
somehow the missing piece
in your heart.

1:38:20.201 --> 1:38:22.399
Most of me is missing,
to be honest.

1:38:22.434 --> 1:38:24.533
It doesn't make any sense

1:38:24.568 --> 1:38:27.404
'cause I have everything
that I ever wanted,

1:38:27.439 --> 1:38:30.407
and I'm... not happy.

1:38:30.442 --> 1:38:32.508
I have a hot husband,

1:38:32.543 --> 1:38:35.280
and I have
two beautiful children,

1:38:35.315 --> 1:38:37.513
and I have...

1:38:37.548 --> 1:38:40.483
12 properties.

1:38:40.518 --> 1:38:44.190
Money doesn't fix
your problems, babe.

1:38:44.225 --> 1:38:46.555
It just makes them prettier.

1:38:49.032 --> 1:38:51.065
Oh! Okay.

1:38:52.728 --> 1:38:54.596
Should I write a book?

1:38:54.631 --> 1:38:56.697
Should I be a poet?

1:38:56.732 --> 1:39:00.008
Should we smash
John Mayer's guitar, um--

1:39:00.043 --> 1:39:01.306
- That's John Mayer's guitar?
- Yes!

1:39:01.341 --> 1:39:03.176
It's John Mayer's guitar.

1:39:03.211 --> 1:39:06.410
He left it here,
and he clearly didn't want it.

1:39:06.445 --> 1:39:08.214
Oh, my God!

1:39:09.448 --> 1:39:12.713
- Stop! Stop!

1:39:14.486 --> 1:39:16.453
Whoo!

1:39:18.820 --> 1:39:20.787
What the fuck are you doing?

1:39:20.822 --> 1:39:23.262
Um, living?

1:39:23.297 --> 1:39:25.396
Let me live, okay?

1:39:27.664 --> 1:39:29.268
Should I call Milton

1:39:29.303 --> 1:39:31.072
and have him bring us
some snacks?

1:39:31.107 --> 1:39:33.074
We're having fun.

1:39:33.109 --> 1:39:35.208
Milton!

1:39:35.243 --> 1:39:36.704
I'm going to bed.

1:39:36.739 --> 1:39:38.178
Bye.

1:39:39.379 --> 1:39:41.775
Milton!

1:41:06.928 --> 1:41:08.829
I'm sorry.

1:41:10.404 --> 1:41:12.173
I'm really--
I'm just really sorry.

1:41:12.208 --> 1:41:14.175
Jack, stop.

1:41:22.944 --> 1:41:24.680
I'm really...

1:41:26.783 --> 1:41:29.454
unhappy.

1:41:29.489 --> 1:41:31.654
I know, and I'm really...

1:41:31.689 --> 1:41:34.195
I'm really sorry,
and I...

1:41:35.759 --> 1:41:37.792
It's not your fault.

1:41:43.338 --> 1:41:45.602
It's nobody's fault.

1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:08.460
I'm really fucking intimidated
by these people.

1:42:10.695 --> 1:42:12.893
I don't want to be
these people.

1:42:15.964 --> 1:42:17.832
I love you.

1:42:17.867 --> 1:42:20.439
I'm sorry.

1:42:27.745 --> 1:42:29.712
Please forgive me.

1:42:32.255 --> 1:42:33.716
You're such a fucking dick.

1:42:35.588 --> 1:42:38.886
Take a sip of the cacao.

1:42:38.921 --> 1:42:40.888
Daniel!

1:42:40.923 --> 1:42:43.495
My God, can we please get
the fuck out of here?

1:42:43.530 --> 1:42:45.266
- Yes, yes,
- Okay.

1:42:45.301 --> 1:42:46.531
Get your shit, go!

1:43:10.755 --> 1:43:12.722
There's still no service.

1:43:20.028 --> 1:43:21.995
We'll figure it out.

1:43:31.743 --> 1:43:33.578
We'll figure it out.

1:44:02.939 --> 1:44:04.873
You know what?
I'm gonna throw in

1:44:04.908 --> 1:44:06.479
an extra case
for you guys.

1:44:06.514 --> 1:44:08.349
- Hey.
- Thank you.

1:44:08.384 --> 1:44:09.944
Yeah, just because
I feel like we're connecting

1:44:09.979 --> 1:44:11.616
on a wine level.

1:44:11.651 --> 1:44:12.947
You know, 'cause
I see people's

1:44:12.982 --> 1:44:14.916
- wine spirits.
- Which one am I?

1:44:14.951 --> 1:44:16.720
Oh...

1:44:21.859 --> 1:44:24.398
The joy. The joy,
it kind of says to me,

1:44:24.433 --> 1:44:26.059
just, like, viognier.

1:44:26.094 --> 1:44:27.731
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, Kerry's

1:44:27.766 --> 1:44:29.634
- kind of effervescent.
- Thank you.

1:44:29.669 --> 1:44:31.537
Effervescent's kind of
a strong word for viognier.

1:44:31.572 --> 1:44:33.033
- You know, okay?

1:44:33.068 --> 1:44:34.474
But that's--
that's just really

1:44:34.509 --> 1:44:35.739
between us wine people.
