-Yeah.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.064
Now you're cooking.

03:10.565 --> 03:14.402
And to do that, three things
have to happen. First, we need to create

-a kick-ass website.

You have to wait for the build.

03:22.493 --> 03:26.164
Our website should be easy to use,
but also cool to look at.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.042
I don't want people to think
they're buying a lame textbook.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.712
That's great, but who's gonna make it
so that it actually works and stuff?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.797
Is one of us a secret computer genius?

Is it me?

Tell me what a browser tab is.

-It's not me.
-It's not me either.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.931
But I've got this bad boy on my side

03:43.014 --> 03:44.515
and three months to learn.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.517
This brings me to my second point.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.978
Are you gonna reveal window number two?
So exciting.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.815
Gah! Ha! I mean, did you practice this?

03:52.899 --> 03:53.942
Where was I?

03:54.025 --> 03:58.321
We need to tell everyone on the planet
that on April 4th, 2008,

03:58.404 --> 03:59.614
Nasty Gal is back.

03:59.697 --> 04:00.740
Why April 4th?

04:00.823 --> 04:03.159
-Because it's Jamie Lynn Spears' birthday?
-What?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.077
What?

04:04.702 --> 04:06.246

04:06.329 --> 04:08.665
that's the date my bank account
achieves negative numbers.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.294
And third, we need to get enough inventory
to last us a few weeks after the launch.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.171

04:30.812 --> 04:32.855
Okay, well, as far as inventory goes,

04:32.939 --> 04:36.567
I think a hundred pieces ought to do it.
But they can't just be any pieces.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.988
These need to be one-of-a-kind items
that you can't find anywhere else.

-Forty-seven.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.079
Welcome aboard.

12:31.333 --> 12:35.963
A hundred items, check. That oddball Kaavi
building a website I designed, check.

12:36.422 --> 12:40.426
And the entire Western vintage
buying world awaiting our launch, check.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.094
This might actually work.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.512
Of course it's going to work.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.556
We have the confidence
of much older women.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.683
[dramatic music playing]

12:58.819 --> 12:59.737
What impression...

13:00.571 --> 13:01.405
do you leave...

13:02.198 --> 13:03.199
on the world?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.662
[crowd clapping]

13:09.246 --> 13:10.331
I need to touch it.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.208
Sophia!

13:12.291 --> 13:13.918
-Gosh! Hi.
-Hi.

13:14.001 --> 13:18.255
Oh, my-- I'm so happy
you are here to witness this.

13:18.339 --> 13:21.091
I mean, at first when I saw you,
I thought I must be hallucinating.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.470
Because how much truth
and beauty can one room fit?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.807
That and the pot cookie I had earlier.
It's the only way to watch art.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.018
-Nathan, Sophia's here!
-Sophia.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.521
-[Sophia] Hi.
-Oh, it's so good to see you.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.438
Yeah, you, too.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.524
Man, that was...

13:36.982 --> 13:37.816
so...

13:38.692 --> 13:41.362
-art.
-The highest form of praise. Bless you.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.781
-Tell her more about it.
-How much time do you have?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.991
-Uh...
-Right, so, the short version.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.869
So, I was at a clearance sale
for the Sharper Image

13:48.953 --> 13:52.039
and there were all these signs
that said "Everything must go."

13:52.122 --> 13:53.791
And I thought, no.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.710
Not everything.
But then as I thought more, it hit me.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.337
Yes.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.089
Everything.

14:03.842 --> 14:04.677
Yes.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.845
-Totally get it.
-[Nathan] Oh, good.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.806
[in choked voice] I'm so happy.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.517
Oh, honey.
Is this about how deep that shit was?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.727
[Nathan in normal voice]
No, I'm fine. It's just, um,

14:13.811 --> 14:18.107
you know, I killed myself
for six months building that apparatus.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.943
I put everything I had into it,
and for what?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.195
Nobody cares.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.283
This show was a total flop.

14:27.366 --> 14:31.871
Your art will find its own audience.
My mouth is so dry.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.163
My tongue is like a mitten.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.333
She's right. You can't put yourself down
after one show.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.918
I've had 24 in the past year.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.211
I've been real busy.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.297
I think I'm done with art.

14:41.839 --> 14:42.923
Or rather,

14:43.007 --> 14:44.758
art is done with me.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.676
It has spoken.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.428
And it said,

14:48.137 --> 14:49.138
[growling] "Get out."

14:49.221 --> 14:52.683
[gasps] Oh! Oh, there we go. It's okay.
You know what? Okay.

14:52.766 --> 14:56.478
So, you're not going to be an artist.
Who cares? You are a jack-of-all-trades.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.315
There is nothing you can't do.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.234
-[softly] Except art.
-You know, it's just time to shift gears.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.152
Right?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.070
I'm gonna just move on
to something else.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.739
Something bigger.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.575
Okay, something
that will change the world.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.994
-Something like dance.
-Something like dance?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.078
[gasps, then squeals]

15:13.162 --> 15:14.455
[both laughing]

15:16.123 --> 15:17.166
-Sophia.
-Come here.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.083
[Sophia chuckles]

15:18.167 --> 15:19.752
[Nathan's mom] Oh, my goodness.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.088
We have a problem.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.674
This is NastyGal.com, your website.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.968
<i>-You're so big, harder...</i>
-And it's filled with porn.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.055
No, okay. I've seen worse.
So, does that help?

15:31.138 --> 15:32.765
<i>-...I feel so nasty.</i>
-No. No, it doesn't.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.518
How did you get this far without checking
if the domain was available?

15:36.602 --> 15:40.189
-Hey. She's had a lot going on.
-Fuck.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.566
I am hella bush league.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.484
So is that.

15:44.026 --> 15:47.112
I prefer erotic fiction.
It's like pornography for the imagination.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.657
[Sophia] Shit. I'm such an idiot.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.910
If you want, I could take two minutes out
of my day to register a new web address.

15:53.827 --> 15:57.623
Or we could use that time to continue
watching this skillful lovemaking.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.917
I've given that address
to thousands of people.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.586
And on April 4th,
everyone's gonna go to NastyGal.com

16:02.670 --> 16:05.589
and get an eyeful of shaved sniz.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.341
Sophia, we can fix this.

16:07.424 --> 16:11.220
Just go back to NastyGalVintage.com.
It was the name of your eBay store.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.472
We'll say there was some confusion.
It's no big deal.

16:13.555 --> 16:16.058
-It's fine.
-No. No. Fine is not perfect.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.102
Well, if you're looking for perfect...

16:23.357 --> 16:24.984
That is not what I asked you to do.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.361
I know.
I did more than what you asked me to do.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.862
I didn't ask you to do that.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.241
I want it the way I want it.
This is my baby we are talking about here.

16:32.324 --> 16:36.036
Well, your customers are gonna find
your baby boring, confusing and ugly.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.622
My sister has that baby.
She named him Cormac.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.044
Your services and your sweatshirts
are no longer welcome.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.047
Fine.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.841
I'll just grab my stuff and go.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.264
This is mine.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.811
[door slams]

17:10.070 --> 17:11.113
[door opens]

17:16.410 --> 17:17.703
[door closes]

17:33.927 --> 17:35.262
Ah, that's too tight.

17:36.263 --> 17:40.934
I also have to breathe whenever I sleep.
I'm like normal people that way.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.270
Sorry.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.106
I'm so stressed out.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.610
-Kaavi is just--
-Who's Kaavi?

17:50.944 --> 17:52.696
The girl building our site.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.115
I told you about her last night.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.744
Don't snap at me. I forget.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.956
She's just so annoying.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.293
Doing her own thing.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.004
As if what I want means nothing.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.466
No respect for authority.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.387
Oh, my God. Who have I become?

18:19.389 --> 18:22.726
[grunts] I have one of those headaches
where I might throw up.

18:25.687 --> 18:26.772
You wanna have sex?

18:28.690 --> 18:30.317
It's been known to cure a headache.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.528
[groans]

18:33.195 --> 18:35.781
The only doctors who say that are dudes.

18:38.158 --> 18:38.992
So, no?

18:42.371 --> 18:45.749
I'm just messing up left and right.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.961
Nothing's perfect.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.005
Everything's a little off.

18:55.592 --> 18:56.927
Well, you're perfect.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.514
And a little off.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.598
[scoffs]

19:02.307 --> 19:03.559
So, it's gonna be great.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.770
[whispers] Whatever.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.210
[Sophia] That jumpsuit.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.131
Where did you get it?

19:56.069 --> 19:57.654
Miss, we have rules here.

19:57.738 --> 20:01.325
-What's happening?
-Well, I will tell you what's happening.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.785
Giant corporations steal from artists

20:03.869 --> 20:06.288
to sell watered-down versions
of authenticity.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.458
And then we all just walk around like--
like sheep.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.293
In a jail of capitalism.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.504
What the hell are you talking about?
Do we not have your size?

20:14.588 --> 20:18.008
I'm gonna put an end to
mass commodification of specialized goods.

20:18.091 --> 20:22.179
No longer will we buy cheaply made clothes
for extraordinary prices.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.057
Well, this particular item
is quite affordable.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.601
Lower price point
than I would have guessed.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.604
I know what I'll do.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.149
How many stores do you have?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.151
Like 400.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.736
In America.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.363
Okay, flawed plan.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.782
Cute jumpsuit.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.700
Yeah, if you're a lady astronaut.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.452
That doesn't make any sense.

20:45.869 --> 20:46.703
I know!

20:47.704 --> 20:52.084
Jumpsuits are out. All jumpsuits are...

20:53.043 --> 20:53.877
out.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.588
[panting]

20:57.047 --> 21:00.717
And I fucking saw something that looked
like this at that horrible place, too.

21:00.801 --> 21:04.930
Whoa. Hey, Soph. Sophia. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down. You're coming unglued.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.057
Want me to restrain you? I took Krav Maga.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.184
Once, to meet a guy
I saw through the window.

21:09.726 --> 21:10.644
What is that?

21:11.228 --> 21:14.189
[Annie] I brought her back
to work on the site. Hey, we need her.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.691
Now, tell me what's wrong.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.277
Everything. All of it.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.530
The website, inventory, outreach,
it's all screwed up.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.366
We are never gonna make
this launch date. We have to push it back.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.534
We'll run out of money.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.120
-We're not fucking ready.
-We cannot push it back.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.539
Oh, man.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.001
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.921
What if we just did all of this work
and no one cares? Everything.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.090
Just for nothing.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.759
I mean, you saw what happened with Nathan.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.429
Maybe I should just quit while I'm ahead.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.472
Before I'm rejected.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.476
I'll just find something else to do.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.770
[sighs] Okay.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.527
I can say this because I'm your friend,

22:01.028 --> 22:03.280
but you can't do anything else.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.532
This store,

22:05.615 --> 22:08.076
this place, this whole idea is you.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.036
It's your dream.

22:09.995 --> 22:10.829
Dreams die.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.080
Yours won't.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.957
I'm serious.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.252
The second that site goes live,
you're a success.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.379
Regardless of whether
you sell a single item.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.882
-How do you figure?
-[Annie] Sophia.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.260
You're a woman
who started a business from nothing.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.596
You pushed through the pins

22:27.679 --> 22:30.557
and made an impression on the world
that wasn't there before.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.434
If you quit now,

22:33.268 --> 22:35.437
you're just a girl
with a bunch of old clothes.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.565
That jumpsuit is good.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.025
It'll sell.

22:40.567 --> 22:44.863
NastyGalVintage.com is good.
Kaavi's website is good.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.406
Kaavi's website is perfect.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.744
You believe me
when I say it's gonna be okay. Right?

22:52.496 --> 22:53.330
Yeah.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.499
I do.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.501
Now...

22:58.210 --> 23:00.712
I know you're new to this boss shit,

23:01.296 --> 23:05.050
but you can't just walk in here
acting like a crazy person.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.303
You need to clear your head.
Take the day off.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.389
-Go get fucked.
-Annie, come on.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.683
Serious.
When was the last time you two did it?

23:16.686 --> 23:18.688
If you have to think, it's been too long.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.857
Raise your hand if you had sex
this morning.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.235
[Sophia] What?

23:25.570 --> 23:28.365
Go to that man of yours
and have him do you.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.158
Fuck your mind straight.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.119
[tongue clacking]

23:32.869 --> 23:33.995
[Sophia] Yeah, we do get it.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.372
-[Annie] Yeah.
-We get it, Kaavi.
