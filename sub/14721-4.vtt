my third husband?

04:52.413 --> 04:54.965

of the place where you work.

04:54.965 --> 04:56.216
A tour?

04:56.216 --> 04:57.628
I wish I could,
but I've got...

04:57.628 --> 04:59.510
contracts to sign.

05:03.384 --> 05:05.185
My assistant Janice.

05:05.185 --> 05:06.517
Really?

05:06.517 --> 05:09.099
Yeah! And I've also
got to set up meetings

05:09.099 --> 05:10.521
with my new client...

05:10.521 --> 05:12.192
uh, Janice.

05:14.695 --> 05:16.857

05:16.857 --> 05:19.940
Bernard Miriam Schotz,
you're not fooling anyone.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.363
You told me you were
a big deal around here.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.865
Just once I'd like
to brag about my grandson

05:24.865 --> 05:28.869
to those stuck up broads
in Speed Walking Club.

05:28.869 --> 05:29.870
Bernie!

05:31.372 --> 05:33.083
Thanks again for helping me

05:33.083 --> 05:35.376
with my Perfectly
 Perfect Skin Care video.

05:37.217 --> 05:39.720
I told you we'd get rid
of all those whiteheads.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.801
Boop!

05:41.922 --> 05:45.926
Oh, now I understand
the charade.

05:45.926 --> 05:47.638
You have a girlfriend.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.890
Now that is something
I can brag about.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.181
Girlfriend?

05:51.181 --> 05:53.394
Amelia's not...

05:53.394 --> 05:56.066
just my girlfriend.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.569
She's my everything.

05:59.570 --> 06:00.691
So now you've seen it all.

06:00.691 --> 06:01.742
-What?
-Let's go.

06:01.742 --> 06:03.744
Oh, who's this?

06:03.744 --> 06:05.946
I didn't know it was
Bring Your Daughter
To Work Day.

06:05.946 --> 06:07.488
Oh.

06:07.488 --> 06:09.700
Dirk, this is my grandma.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.582
Hey, you're DareMeBro.

06:11.582 --> 06:13.293
Bernard just showed me the video

06:13.293 --> 06:14.995
where someone dared you
to play basketball

06:14.995 --> 06:16.587
on the wing
of a plane.

06:16.587 --> 06:18.759
You're very stupid.

06:18.759 --> 06:19.960
Aww.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.462
Thanks for watching.

06:22.593 --> 06:23.964
Hey, Bernie, you know what?

06:23.964 --> 06:25.055
You should invite your grandma

06:25.055 --> 06:26.557
to the Bizaardvark show
this weekend.

06:26.557 --> 06:28.469
I'm going,
Amelia's going--

06:28.469 --> 06:29.640
No, I don't think
my grandma can.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.771
I'd love to!

06:30.771 --> 06:33.273
It'll give me a chance
to get to know this Amelia girl.

06:33.273 --> 06:34.935
Great.

06:34.935 --> 06:38.439
I guess we all need
to get to know Amelia
a little better.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.981
Come on, Grandma.
I'll give you a tour of Vuuugle.

06:40.981 --> 06:42.282
What up, Janice?

06:48.078 --> 06:49.119
(knock on door)

06:49.119 --> 06:50.951
Mom, we're rehearsing!

06:50.951 --> 06:52.332
It's not your mom!

06:52.332 --> 06:54.204
It's your biggest fan Belissa!

06:54.204 --> 06:55.956
Surprise!

06:55.956 --> 06:57.458
Both:
Belissa?

06:57.458 --> 07:00.380
I'm in Frankie
from Bizaardvark's bedroom.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.042
I have to touch everything.

07:02.042 --> 07:05.135
Frankie's bed.
Frankie's pillow.

07:05.135 --> 07:07.257
Frankie's floor!

07:08.428 --> 07:09.810
Frankie's hat!

07:09.810 --> 07:11.011
(sniffs)

07:11.011 --> 07:12.723
No, that's Paige's.

07:14.645 --> 07:15.686
Uh...

07:15.686 --> 07:18.769
wait, you came
all the way from Nebraska

07:18.769 --> 07:19.860
just to see our show?

07:19.860 --> 07:21.982
No! That would be crazy.

07:21.982 --> 07:23.944
I moved here
all the way from Nebraska

07:23.944 --> 07:25.826
to be closer to you!

07:27.698 --> 07:28.989
(sniffs)

07:28.989 --> 07:31.241
Your hair smells like rainbows.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.672
So, uh, Belissa...

07:41.672 --> 07:43.173
you moved here?

07:43.173 --> 07:45.586
Did your dad apply
for a new job or something?

07:45.586 --> 07:47.007
Sort of.

07:47.007 --> 07:49.139
I applied for him
and also sold our house.

07:49.139 --> 07:50.641
(shrill laugh)

07:53.894 --> 07:55.185
What's with the measuring?

07:55.185 --> 07:58.098
I want my new room to be
an exact replica of yours.

07:58.098 --> 08:00.270
That way when you come over,
you'll be like,

08:00.270 --> 08:02.402
"I don't know if I'm at my house
or Belissa's house.

08:02.402 --> 08:03.734
Oh well,
I'll just stay forever!"

08:03.734 --> 08:05.696
(laughs)

08:05.696 --> 08:08.198
So which side
of the bed is mine?

08:08.198 --> 08:10.490
Doesn't matter.
I can watch you sleep
from either side.

08:12.112 --> 08:13.664
What is going on?

08:13.664 --> 08:15.746
I don't know, but we need
to get this girl out of here

08:15.746 --> 08:17.618
so we can practice
for our gig.

08:17.618 --> 08:20.711
Also, remind me
to change my sheets.

08:20.711 --> 08:21.792
Okay.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.884
But be nice.
She's our first super fan.

08:23.884 --> 08:25.005
Okay.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.678
Okay, Belissa,
it's been really fun,

08:27.678 --> 08:29.630
but we kind of need
to rehearse for...

08:29.630 --> 08:31.892
Bizaardvark Live!

08:31.892 --> 08:33.554
How'd she know
about the hand thing?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.225
-How'd she get in my pajamas?
-(gasps)

08:36.847 --> 08:38.558
I want to watch
Bizaardvark rehearse.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.140
Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse!

08:40.140 --> 08:42.232
Okay, guess we're doing this.

08:43.734 --> 08:45.235
This is a new song we wrote.

08:45.235 --> 08:46.857
It's about the worst
weekend of my life.

08:46.857 --> 08:48.949
(laughs)

08:49.990 --> 08:51.451
Anyway...

08:51.451 --> 08:53.283
it's about the time
I got dragged on

08:53.283 --> 08:54.655
a camping trip
with my family

08:54.655 --> 08:56.246
while my friends were
at home having fun.

08:56.246 --> 08:59.580

09:27.397 --> 09:28.398
Yes!

09:31.952 --> 09:33.153
And locked.

09:37.537 --> 09:40.250
For the show tonight,
I'm thinking we start off
with something high energy.

09:40.250 --> 09:44.374
What if we open with
 We're Feeling Meh?

09:44.374 --> 09:46.296
We'll figure out
the set list later.

09:46.296 --> 09:47.377
I can't even concentrate.

09:47.377 --> 09:49.169
I'm so pumped
for our show!

09:49.169 --> 09:50.921
-Me too!
-(screams)

09:50.921 --> 09:53.133
Belissa, you enrolled
in our school?

09:53.133 --> 09:54.635
Yup. I even
stayed back a grade

09:54.635 --> 09:55.926
so I could be
in your class!

09:57.267 --> 09:59.890
Also, I was scanning
your school records

09:59.890 --> 10:02.102
and noticed you're having
trouble in some of your classes.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.275
So, I put a little gift
in your backpack.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.491
"I stole the answers
to every test."

10:11.491 --> 10:12.863
(clears throat)

10:15.155 --> 10:17.698
I can't believe
we both got detention.

10:17.698 --> 10:20.540
(whispers)
I didn't get detention.

10:25.545 --> 10:26.957
So let me get this straight.

10:26.957 --> 10:28.298
Your grandma's coming
to the show,

10:28.298 --> 10:29.960
and she thinks
Amelia is your girlfriend?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.051
Right.

10:31.051 --> 10:32.673
So, you need
to trick your grandma

10:32.673 --> 10:34.634
into thinking
you're on a date
with Amelia.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.888
But Amelia can't know
she's on a fake date with you
to trick your grandma.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.349
-Uh-huh.
-Oh.

10:39.349 --> 10:41.181
-It's like that movie.
-Which movie?

10:41.181 --> 10:45.025
The one I'm gonna write
about us when we pull this off.

10:45.025 --> 10:46.817
Thanks for helping me.

10:46.817 --> 10:49.860
Just once, I want my grandma
to be proud of me for something.

10:49.860 --> 10:51.191
No sweat, Bern-man.

10:51.191 --> 10:53.153
All it's gonna take
is a little pretending,

10:53.153 --> 10:54.444
and I'm great at that.

10:54.444 --> 10:57.487
I once got dared to pretend
I was a crane operator.

10:57.487 --> 11:00.410
Okay, so we're gonna
use that crane parked out front.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.743
Just give me like five seconds
to learn some basic moves

11:02.743 --> 11:05.245
and then come out
with the camera, okay?

11:05.245 --> 11:06.496
Here we go!

11:08.789 --> 11:10.050
(crane operating)

11:10.050 --> 11:11.211
(crash)

11:13.714 --> 11:14.885
That's a wrap!

11:17.467 --> 11:20.390
Okay, bad example.

11:20.390 --> 11:22.723
But I can still
give you some tips
to help with Amelia.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.394
Like the tea trick.

11:24.394 --> 11:26.066
You offer to buy Amelia tea,

11:26.066 --> 11:28.688
and ask her if she wants
honey or sugar.

11:28.688 --> 11:33.153
That just sounds like
I'm out three bucks for tea.

11:33.153 --> 11:34.815
No, when she answers,

11:34.815 --> 11:37.657
it'll sound like she's calling
you "honey" or "sugar."

11:37.657 --> 11:39.870
Let's act it out.
I'll be Amelia.

11:39.870 --> 11:42.202
(imitates Amelia)
I'd love some tea.

11:43.784 --> 11:46.456
Oh, great.
Would you like sugar or...

11:46.456 --> 11:47.918
What was the other one?

11:47.918 --> 11:48.959
-Honey.
-Right.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.670
Would you like
honey or tea?

11:50.670 --> 11:52.422
I mean honey.

11:52.422 --> 11:55.595
I mean...
what was it?

11:55.595 --> 11:57.257
Okay, too advanced.

11:58.508 --> 11:59.679
Here's another trick.

11:59.679 --> 12:01.762
Challenge Amelia
to a staring contest.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.343
That way, it'll look like

12:03.343 --> 12:05.395
you guys can't keep
your eyes off of each other.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.017
(imitates Amelia)
Let's practice, y'all!

12:12.272 --> 12:13.523
What's with the tongue?

12:13.523 --> 12:14.614
Oh, sorry.

12:15.615 --> 12:16.656
But open your eyes.

12:19.119 --> 12:20.120
Tongue.

12:21.121 --> 12:22.162
Eyes open.

12:22.162 --> 12:23.623
To-- no, together.

12:23.623 --> 12:25.916
Have you seen
a doctor about that?

12:25.916 --> 12:27.247
A whole team.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.176
Your girlfriend doesn't talk
to you much.

12:36.176 --> 12:37.968
Yeah, she's shy.

12:37.968 --> 12:40.090
In fact, she might not talk
to me all night.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.471
That's strange.

12:41.471 --> 12:43.093
What romance isn't?

12:46.476 --> 12:48.728
Frankie, the house is packed!

12:50.350 --> 12:52.562
If we bomb this show,
it'll be the end of Bizaardvark

12:52.562 --> 12:54.734
and no one will listen
to our music ever again!

12:54.734 --> 12:56.156
Paige, you're doing that thing

12:56.156 --> 12:58.738
where you get really nervous
and talk in extremes.

12:58.738 --> 13:01.281
You're right.
We're gonna have
a great show!

13:01.281 --> 13:03.363
Everyone's gonna love us,
and by tomorrow,

13:03.363 --> 13:04.784
we'll have a billion fans!

13:04.784 --> 13:07.247
Wow, when your pendulum swings,
it swings hard.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.080
You're right.
We got this.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.581
Slow motion dance party.

13:11.581 --> 13:14.835
Both:
Whoooooa!

13:17.757 --> 13:19.219
Whaaat's up?

13:19.219 --> 13:20.630
-Aah!
-Belissa!

13:20.630 --> 13:21.922
Where'd you come from?

13:21.922 --> 13:24.054
Omaha! I moved here
to be closer to my besties--

13:24.054 --> 13:25.385
We know.

13:25.385 --> 13:27.187
But here's a crazy idea.

13:27.187 --> 13:28.929
No offense.

13:28.929 --> 13:31.481
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in the audience?

13:31.481 --> 13:32.482
Okay! Break a leg!

13:35.065 --> 13:36.196
Look at you two.

13:36.196 --> 13:38.528
You can't take your eyes
off each other.

13:42.442 --> 13:44.654
I'll leave you lovebirds alone.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.078
Did she say lovebirds?

13:48.078 --> 13:50.871
No, she said...

13:50.871 --> 13:52.582
glove nerds.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.044
No more questions.

13:54.044 --> 13:56.006
What is going on and...

13:56.006 --> 13:58.338
why are we having
so many staring contests?

13:59.509 --> 14:00.881
(gasps)

14:00.881 --> 14:03.383
Are you pretending
we're on a fake date
to trick your grandma?

14:03.383 --> 14:04.554
How did you know?

14:04.554 --> 14:06.806
I know how
a fake date works.

14:06.806 --> 14:08.348
I'm on three right now.

14:09.809 --> 14:11.771
Please don't tell my grandma.

14:11.771 --> 14:14.144
You don't know
what it's like
to live with her.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.897
I can never do
anything right.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.689
This is my first chance
to make her proud of me.

14:19.689 --> 14:21.241
Wow, Bernie.

14:21.241 --> 14:23.613
It's like you
exfoliated your soul

14:23.613 --> 14:24.744
and the truth came out.

14:24.744 --> 14:27.908
I did what?

14:27.908 --> 14:29.910
Is that good?

14:31.411 --> 14:34.454
You know how I love
to help the less fortunate.

14:34.454 --> 14:35.916
So, I'll do it.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.048
I'll be your pretend girlfriend.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.549
Thank you!
And don't worry,

14:39.549 --> 14:41.761
you only have to pretend
for tonight.

14:41.761 --> 14:44.384
Good news. I invited Granny
to tomorrow night's show,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.506
and she is totally down.

14:46.506 --> 14:48.348
She is one cool granny, bro.

14:51.851 --> 14:53.603
You can't help me out
one time?

14:55.775 --> 14:57.897
-Hey, guys! I'm Paige!
-I'm Frankie...

14:57.897 --> 15:00.981
Both:
And this is Bizaardvark Live!

15:00.981 --> 15:02.192
(applause)

15:03.823 --> 15:05.615
I'm their agent!

15:05.615 --> 15:07.948
Sit down, Bernie.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.789
We're gonna start off
with a new song.

15:09.789 --> 15:12.122
It's called Getting Dragged
 on a Camping Trip
 with Your Family

15:12.122 --> 15:14.124
While Your Friends are
 at Home Having Fun.

15:14.124 --> 15:15.625

16:44.003 --> 16:45.715
Belissa, what are you doing?

16:45.715 --> 16:46.886
You're ruining our show!

16:46.886 --> 16:49.429
What? No!
The show's a huge hit.

16:49.429 --> 16:51.841
Girls, this show's a disaster!

16:53.053 --> 16:54.224
I'm canceling tonight,

You can't cancel our shows!

17:02.902 --> 17:05.023
Belissa, this is
all your fault.

17:05.023 --> 17:08.108
Tonight was supposed to be
the start of Bizaardvark Live
and you ruined it.

17:09.108 --> 17:10.650
Yeah. How can we do
Bizaardvark Live

17:10.650 --> 17:12.612
if we can't even do
one show live?

17:13.613 --> 17:15.415
I didn't mean to do
anything wrong.

17:15.415 --> 17:16.915
I'm your biggest fan.

17:16.915 --> 17:18.288
Not anymore.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.790
I'm sorry, Belissa,
but we don't want you
as our super fan anymore.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.423
Oh.

17:23.423 --> 17:25.125
I'm sorry.

17:25.125 --> 17:28.127
All I ever wanted to do
was meet my idols.

17:29.509 --> 17:31.431

this anymore.

is, well, you,

17:55.365 --> 17:58.538
but the good news
is Amelia said

17:58.538 --> 18:00.460
she'd pretend to be
my girlfriend for another night,

18:00.460 --> 18:03.293
so you win some,
you lose some.

18:03.293 --> 18:06.045
Sorry, Bernie.
There's not gonna
be another night.

18:06.045 --> 18:08.128
The owner just canceled
tomorrow's show.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.259
What?

18:09.259 --> 18:11.511
He can't treat
my clients like that.

18:11.511 --> 18:13.883
I'll handle this.
Wait here.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.097
Oh, and cover your ears.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.560
Bernie's gonna use
some colorful language.

18:22.982 --> 18:24.314
Please, please, please!

18:24.314 --> 18:28.148
I'm just a kid
with a fake girlfriend!

18:28.148 --> 18:29.899
Cafe Owner:
All right, I'll give them
another night.

18:29.899 --> 18:31.321
Just stop begging!
It's sad!

18:34.994 --> 18:37.197
If you're gonna be
my pretend boyfriend,

18:37.197 --> 18:39.329
you have to look
like my real boyfriend.

18:39.329 --> 18:41.831
Yay makeover!

18:41.831 --> 18:43.913
These pants are really tight.

18:43.913 --> 18:46.416
I can barely feel my legs.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.209
Wait, you can still feel them?

18:49.209 --> 18:50.880
Angelo, tighter.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.632
(grunts)

18:52.632 --> 18:55.385
Your teeth aren't as shiny
as they could be.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.427
-(grunts)
-I'll get the tile cleaner.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.519
Tile cleaner?

18:59.519 --> 19:02.021
How do you feel
about body spray?

19:02.021 --> 19:04.184
I'm actually not
a big fan of...

19:06.856 --> 19:08.107
(strained)
body spray.

19:14.574 --> 19:16.616
Why are you walking like that?

19:16.616 --> 19:17.947
This suit is too tight.

19:17.947 --> 19:19.449
I can barely move.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.781
Wait until you see
your outfit for tomorrow.

19:21.781 --> 19:24.994
Two words:
Span. Dex.

19:24.994 --> 19:26.706
What do you mean tomorrow?

19:26.706 --> 19:29.048
I thought this was
just for tonight.

19:29.048 --> 19:31.291
I'm really liking
this fake boyfriend thing.

19:31.291 --> 19:32.792
It's all the fun
of fixing someone

19:32.792 --> 19:35.295
without the work
of having a boyfriend.

19:36.296 --> 19:37.677
Okay, that's it.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.389
I can't do this anymore.

19:39.389 --> 19:40.850
We're over.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.642
You're breaking up with me?

19:42.642 --> 19:44.934
You're breaking up with her?

19:46.646 --> 19:49.359
Look, Amelia...

19:49.359 --> 19:51.691
you're a good kid.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.072
And I'm sure

19:53.072 --> 19:56.576
one day, you'll find
someone as smooth

19:56.576 --> 19:58.868
and cool as me.

19:58.868 --> 20:01.531
-(seams ripping)
-Oh, I just ripped my pants.

20:04.994 --> 20:07.997
Oh man, that was emotional.

20:07.997 --> 20:10.670
What, your fake breakup
with your fake girlfriend?

20:10.670 --> 20:12.091
You knew?

20:12.091 --> 20:15.295
Bernie, please,
I may not be allowed
to drive at night anymore,

20:15.295 --> 20:17.297
but I'm not blind.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.679
Sorry.

20:19.679 --> 20:21.511
I was just trying
to find one thing

20:21.511 --> 20:22.682
to make you proud
of me.

20:22.682 --> 20:25.395
Bernard, you lied,
you pretended,

20:25.395 --> 20:27.807
you manipulated people
just to impress me.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.560
You're a real Schotz.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.442
I couldn't be more proud.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.314
Really? Thanks, Grandma!

20:34.314 --> 20:36.616
Now go fix your pants.
I can see things.

20:38.698 --> 20:41.030
Hey, you guys ready to play?

20:41.030 --> 20:42.071
We sure are!

20:42.071 --> 20:44.123
Thanks for giving us
another chance.

20:44.123 --> 20:45.995
-We won't let you down.
-I hope not.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.166
You got another full house.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.669
That promoter of yours
really hustled for you.

20:50.670 --> 20:51.711
Promoter?

20:51.711 --> 20:53.293
That bassoon girl.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.254
She's been promoting
your shows all week.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.677
She knocked on doors,
passed out flyers,

20:57.677 --> 20:58.878
she even painted my house.

20:58.878 --> 21:01.971
I didn't ask her to,
but she did.

21:04.183 --> 21:07.597
Belissa did all of this for us
and we got rid of her?

21:07.597 --> 21:09.809
-We have to fix this right now.
-What about the show?

21:09.809 --> 21:12.312
What about playing
for billions of fans
all over the world?

21:12.312 --> 21:14.694
If we can't appreciate
one super fan,

21:14.694 --> 21:16.816
then we don't deserve
to have a billion fans.

21:22.992 --> 21:24.404
Hey! Where are you going?

21:24.404 --> 21:25.825
Who's gonna do the show?

21:25.825 --> 21:27.166
I got this.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.998
I've been working on
my stand-up comedy.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.121
Ahem.

21:32.121 --> 21:35.174
Anyone here tonight
with their fake girlfriend?

21:43.683 --> 21:46.346
Belissa, we're really sorry
to bother you at home,

21:46.346 --> 21:47.847
but we want to apologize and--

21:47.847 --> 21:51.521
Oh, my gosh,
she actually did it!

21:52.692 --> 21:54.984
This room is
exactly like mine!

21:54.984 --> 21:56.566
That's impressive!

21:56.566 --> 21:58.528
Scary, but impressive!

21:59.649 --> 22:02.402
Even the inside
of the drawers are the same.

22:02.402 --> 22:05.445
Well, you might not
know this, but...

22:05.445 --> 22:08.708
there was a time
when I was a really big
Bizaardvark fan.

22:08.708 --> 22:10.660
(whispers)
Not anymore.

22:11.871 --> 22:14.914
We know, and we feel
really bad about what we did.

22:14.914 --> 22:17.957
So, we wrote a song
about how we both miss
our biggest fan.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.382
Yes, it's you, Belissa,

22:22.382 --> 22:24.223
the only other person
in this room.
