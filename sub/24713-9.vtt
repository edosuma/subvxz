GET A FEW THINGS CLEAR.

00:15.765 --> 00:16.933
I WANT YOU TO SING.

I'LL TELL YOU IN THE CAR.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.410
HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.747
YEAH. IN HERE.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.048
FIRST OF ALL,

04:17.048 --> 04:20.051
MRS. HORNBY WANTED ME TO EXTEND
HER DEEPEST APOLOGIES

04:20.051 --> 04:21.719
IF SHE OFFENDED YOU
IN ANY WAY.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.513
TELL HER NO BIG DEAL.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.683
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T CARE.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.727
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT
SHE'S NOT THE EASIEST WOMAN
TO GET ALONG WITH AT TIMES.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.855
LOOK, IT'S NICE OF YOU
TO COME DOWN HERE, BUT, UH...

04:32.855 --> 04:36.067
I THINK MRS. HORNBY'S BEEN
WORRYING ABOUT THIS A LITTLE
MORE THAN I HAVE.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.444
SECOND, MRS. HORNBY WOULD LIKE
YOU TO COME BACK

04:38.444 --> 04:40.363
AND PROVIDE SECURITY.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.198
NO. NO WAY.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.575
SHE PROMISES
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.870
SHE'S BETTER OFF WITH
SOMEBODY WHO ENTERTAINS --

04:47.870 --> 04:51.916
SOMEBODY WHO CAN SING --
WORK WITH BALLOONS, MAYBE.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.294
HONESTLY,
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.547
BUT SHE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE
WITH A DETECTIVE IN HER HOME.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.174
SHE WON'T GIVE ME A MOMENT'S
PEACE TILL I GET YOU BACK.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.884
ASK EDDIE GIBSON
FOR ANOTHER REFERRAL.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.803
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO MEET ANYONE ELSE.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.515
I TELL YOU WHAT--
I'LL ADD $50 A SHIFT.

05:07.515 --> 05:12.603
THAT'S $250, WHICH, I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU GET ANYWHERE ELSE

05:12.603 --> 05:14.689
FOR FOUR OF DOING
BASICALLY NOTHING.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.858
YEAH, 'CAUSE MY WHOLE GOAL
IN LIFE, WORKWISE,

05:16.858 --> 05:18.818
IS TO AVOID AS MUCH WORK
AS POSSIBLE.

05:18.818 --> 05:24.449
I APOLOGIZE. $300.
THAT'S $600 A WEEK -- CASH.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.993
I GOT A YOUNG SON AT HOME.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.912
IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO MISS HIM
TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.

05:29.912 --> 05:32.457
LET ME LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.958
MRS. HORNBY DOESN'T HAVE
ANY CHILDREN.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.461
EDDIE WORKED FOR HER FOR
A YEAR AND A HALF.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.463
EDDIE'S DRIVING
A BRAND-NEW SUV.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.257
EDDIE IS BEING TREATED BY THE
TOP ONCOLOGIST IN NEW YORK.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.676
SHE CARES ABOUT THOSE
WHO ARE CLOSE TO HER.

05:43.676 --> 05:47.138
THINGS A GUY LIKE EDDIE GIBSON
WOULD DO OR WOULD PUT UP WITH

05:47.138 --> 05:49.557
TO GET THOSE KINDS
OF HANDOUTS, I WOULDN'T.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.809
SO THAT'S NOT A BIG
SELLING POINT WITH ME.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.478
YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE
TO WATER.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.645
I GOT WORK TO DO.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.315
WHEN YOU REALIZE YOUR MISTAKE
AND CALL TO THE JOB BACK,

05:57.315 --> 05:59.025
THE OFFER WILL BE BACK TO $200.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.110
YEAH. GO WAIT BY YOUR PHONE.

HER JEWELRY BOX.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.657
SHE GETS HIT, STARTS SCREAMING,

07:34.078 --> 07:36.330

CHASED THE PERPS.

TO BELLEVUE ALSO.

07:45.756 --> 07:49.260
HE GOT A LITTLE BANGED UP IN A
SCUFFLE WITH THESE GUYS.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.428
GOT A WITNESS OVER HERE.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.806
TAKE THAT.
WE GOT THIS.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.349
HEY, FELLAS.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.059
GUY MUST HAVE BEEN A HANDFUL.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.187
YEAH, HE WAS THROWING ELBOWS
AND KICKING.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.023
HE MUST HAVE BEEN ON SOMETHING,
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T QUIT.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.150
WHERE WERE YOU GUYS
WHEN THIS WENT DOWN?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.194
OUT FRONT HERE.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.414

JUST ABOVE MRS. WOODROW.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.958
HEARD HER SCREAM.
BY THE TIME I GOT OUT,

08:20.958 --> 08:23.211
THE SCUMBAGS WERE DOWN

08:23.211 --> 08:26.088

08:30.885 --> 08:32.762
BACK OF HIS HEAD.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.138
ONCE WE GET A NAME,

08:34.138 --> 08:36.224
WE'LL HAVE YOU LOOK AT PICTURES
IN CASE YOU CAN I.D. HIM.

SHE CAN'T SEE HIM.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.972

A STANDING AGREEMENT.

HOW WAS HE
WITH YOU BEING IN VICE?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.656
HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH
THE HOURS, THE OUTFITS.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.241
YOU WERE READY TO GET OUT?

09:35.241 --> 09:37.785
I WAS READY TO DO WHATEVER I
COULD TO SAVE OUR MARRIAGE.

09:37.785 --> 09:38.786
IS IT BETTER?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.705

WHO WAS HE RUNNING WITH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.101
PARTY GIRL?
NOT ON SQUAD, SHE'S NOT.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.394
HOW ABOUT THE MEN HERE?

10:45.394 --> 10:46.604
WHY?

10:46.604 --> 10:49.190
I'VE WORKED WITH COPS
FOR A LONG TIME NOW,

10:49.190 --> 10:52.193
AND I KNOW COPS ARE DOGS.
ADMIT IT.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.402
I DIDN'T DENY IT.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.404
I KNOW ONE OF YOUR CODES
IS THAT A COP

10:55.404 --> 10:57.406
NEVER GOES AFTER
ANOTHER COP'S WIFE.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.991
THAT SAME RULE APPARENTLY
DOESN'T APPLY

10:58.991 --> 11:00.576
FOR AN ASSISTANT DA's WIFE.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.746
IF ANYTHING,
AT RITA'S LAST COMMAND,

11:03.746 --> 11:05.915
THEY WENT AFTER HER LIKE THEY'D
BEEN SHIPWRECKED-

11:05.915 --> 11:09.126
SOME RESENTMENT FROM ME,
MY OFFICE, LAWYERS IN GENERAL.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.670
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING HERE.

11:10.670 --> 11:15.132
BUT IF SOME OF THE GUYS DO
GET...INAPPROPRIATE

11:15.132 --> 11:17.510
I'D HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW...

11:17.510 --> 11:20.179
I'M NOT GONNA KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR WIFE FOR YOU.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.307
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M ASKING
FOR ONE OF YOUR KIDNEYS, TONY.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.226
I'M NOT GONNA KEEP
AN EYE ON HER.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.645
LET'S MAKE THIS THE LAST TIME
WE TALK ABOUT IT, HUH?

11:27.645 --> 11:30.523
IF I WAS A COP, YOU WOULD.
YOU'RE WRONG.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.775
IT'S GREAT SEEING YOU.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.944
[ SIGHS ]

11:37.071 --> 11:39.907
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS DRILL A
COUPLE TIMES BEFORE, ANDREW.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.576
LOOKS LIKE YOU TESTIFIED
AGAINST YOUR ACCOMPLICE,

11:42.576 --> 11:44.203
AND WORKED OUT A PLEA
EACH TIME.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.705
YEAH. SO?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.082
THAT HOW WE'RE DOING THIS?
DOING WHAT?

11:48.082 --> 11:49.792
WHAT DID I DO?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.502
WHEN YOU'RE OLD AND GRAY,
ANDREW,

11:51.502 --> 11:53.421
AND YOU'RE REGALING
YOUR GRANDKIDS

11:53.421 --> 11:55.798
WITH STORIES
ABOUT YOUR WILD YOUTH

11:55.798 --> 11:57.800
AND YOU GATHER THE LITTLE
MOPPETS AROUND,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.761
TELL THEM ABOUT THE TIME YOU
POSED AS AN EXTERMINATOR

12:00.761 --> 12:01.971
WITH YOUR BUDDY DONNIE

12:01.971 --> 12:04.932
AND HOW YOU TRIED TO RIP OFF
THE 80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.518
BUT SHE WOULDN'T GIVE IT UP,

12:07.518 --> 12:09.645
SO YOU SUCKER-PUNCHED HER
AND RAN,

12:09.645 --> 12:11.814
LEAVING DONNIE BEHIND
TO GET HIS ASS KICKED.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.401
THEN GO ON ABOUT HOW
YOU BEEN BUSTED BEFORE

12:15.401 --> 12:17.486
POSING AS AN EXTERMINATOR

12:17.486 --> 12:20.156
AND HOW PEOPLE
SAW YOU FLEE THE SCENE

12:20.156 --> 12:21.657
IN YOUR EXTERMINATOR OUTFIT

12:21.657 --> 12:24.952
AND HOW YOU'D NEVER WORKED
AS AN EXTERMINATOR BEFORE

12:24.952 --> 12:27.955
SO THERE WAS NO OTHER REASON
FOR YOU TO OWN THE UNIFORM.

12:27.955 --> 12:32.251
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE OUT
HOW WHEN THE COPS CAME,

12:32.251 --> 12:35.212
INSTEAD OF DITCHING THEM,

12:35.212 --> 12:37.757
YOU HAD THE EXTERMINATOR
COVERALLS

12:37.757 --> 12:39.717
BALLED UP
ON YOUR BEDROOM FLOOR.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.555
YEAH, OKAY.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.350
LET'S WRITE IT UP.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.857
THE ACCOMPLICE, ANDREW SIME --
HE WENT FOR IT

12:54.857 --> 12:57.026
HE ACTS LIKE HE'S ON
A SNOOTFUL OF DDT

12:57.026 --> 12:59.320
BUT HE CLEARED UP LONG ENOUGH

12:59.320 --> 13:02.406
TO PIN THE WHOLE THING ON HIS
RUNNING BUDDY, DONNIE HERTZNER,

13:02.406 --> 13:04.492
WHO THOSE TWO CIVILIANS
DETAINED AT THE SCENE.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.203
WHAT'S HERTZNER SAYING?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.163
HE WENT DOA
ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.164
YOU'RE KIDDING.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.290
FROM WHAT?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.375
BLEEDING INTO HIS BRAIN.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.503
OFF THE BEATING HE TOOK FROM
THOSE GUYS ON THE STREET?

13:15.503 --> 13:16.504
LOOKING LIKE IT.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.380
WE GOTTA FIND T
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.258
ALL WE'VE BEEN HEARING IS THESE
TWO GUYS WERE GOOD SAMARITANS

13:21.258 --> 13:23.344
WHO RESPONDED WHEN THE OLD LADY
STARTED SCREAMING.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.804
THE PERP
WAS THROWING PUNCHES, TOO.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.765
ONE OF THE GUYS GOT A BUSTED LIP
TRYING TO HOLD THE PERP.

13:27.765 --> 13:28.974
THAT'S SOME OF IT.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.393
BUT NOW WE GOTTA FIND OUT
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.603
LET'S GO

13:36.106 --> 13:37.900
YOU GOT A SECOND?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.538
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I'M NOT UP FOR --

13:50.538 --> 13:51.997
GOING BACK TO THE NONSENSE

13:51.997 --> 13:54.041
OF US HAVING TO ACT LIKE WE
DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER AT WORK.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.001
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.090
I THINK I'M PREGNANT.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.260
YOU THINK?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.387
I TOOK A TEST.
TWICE.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.763
THEY BOTH CAME BACK POSITIVE?

14:07.763 --> 14:09.473
YEAH, OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T
THINK I'M PREGNANT.

14:09.473 --> 14:13.352
YOU DROPPED THIS ON MY LAP,
I'M SORRY IF I'M A LITTLE
MIXED UP HERE.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.021
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN
THE WAY I AM.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.902
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON THE PILL.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.946
I AM, BUT I'M PREGNANT.

14:30.035 --> 14:34.039
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.416
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

14:35.416 --> 14:36.834
I DON'T KNOW.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.377
I GOTTA THINK.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.171
AT WHAT POINT DO I GET INVOLVED
IN THE DECISION PROCESS?

14:41.171 --> 14:43.090
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.023
JOHNNY.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.649
HEY. IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.985
HEY, BRIAN, HOW YOU DOING?
HOW'S LOUISE?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.445
REAL GOOD.
EVERYONE'S GOOD.

15:07.865 --> 15:08.991
POP.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.159
JOHN.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.536
COME ON, SHAKE HANDS
OR SOMETHING.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.873
BRIAN HOWERSON,
ANDY SIPOWITZ.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.416
ARE WE READY TO GET STARTED?

15:17.416 --> 15:18.584
COFFEE ROOM.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.509
WE'VE HAD FOUR REPORTED MASSAGE
PARLORS HIT IN THE LAST MONTH --

15:27.509 --> 15:30.137
TWO HISPANIC MALES IN THEIR 20s,
IN EARLY MORNING,

15:30.137 --> 15:32.139
STICK UP THE MADAM,
AND HIT THE ROAD.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.390
ANY LUCK WITH WITNESSES?

15:33.390 --> 15:35.392
MADAM'S PUT ON THE FLOOR
RIGHT AWAY.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.227
ANY I.D.s ON THE JOHNS?

15:37.227 --> 15:39.021
PEOPLE DON'T SHOW I.D.s
IN PLACES LIKE THAT.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.981
ON OURS, ESU FOUND WALLETS
DUMPED NEARBY.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.483
ONE BELONGED TO A DOA.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.485
ANOTHER I.D. WAS IDENTIFIED
BY THE MADAM

15:44.485 --> 15:45.903
AS BELONGING TO A JOHN.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.072
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT RELATED.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.408
WHAT KIND OF GUNS
THE PERPS CARRY?

15:51.408 --> 15:53.243
SILVER-COLORED AUTOMATICS.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.454
ONE OF THE GUYS HAVE A MUSTACHE,
THE OTHER CLEAN-SHAVEN?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.998
THE GUY WITH THE MUSTACHE
HAD A WOOLEN HAT?

15:57.998 --> 15:59.291
MAYBE THEY<i> ARE </i>RELATED.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.835
FIRST STEP -- WE GET ON THE
PHONE TO COMMANDS IN THE BRONX

16:01.835 --> 16:04.338
AND HAVE THEM PULL 61's ON
WALLETS REPORTED LOST OR STOLEN

16:04.338 --> 16:05.839
THE DAY AFTER YOUR ROBBERIES.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.300
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN
THE OVERSIGHT?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.551
I DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS
AN OVERSIGHT.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.553
I JUST MEANT WE SHOULD COVER
OUR BASES.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.806
LET US TAKE CARE
OF COMMANDS IN THE BRONX.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.100
YOU HUNT FOR YOUR JOHN
WHO LOST HIS WALLET.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.686
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
DR. OLSEN TO SEE YOU.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.521
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL,
HERE HE IS.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.356
WE'LL BE LOOKING IN.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.328
WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

16:36.328 --> 16:38.622
I'D RATHER YOU JUST GAVE ME
THE WALLET --

16:38.622 --> 16:40.082
LET ME GET BACK TO THE OFFICE.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.750
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LOST IT.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.085
IT JUST FELL OUT
OF MY POCKET.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.503
ANY IDEA WHERE?

16:44.503 --> 16:47.423
WELL, I KNEW THAT, I WOULDN'T
HAVE LOST IT, RIGHT?

16:47.423 --> 16:49.091
WHEN DID YOU NOTICE
IT WAS GONE?

16:49.091 --> 16:50.509
WHEN I GOT HOME.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.136
WERE YOU IN CHINATOWN
LAST NIGHT?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.178
NO.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.347
EVER HEARD OF A MASSAGE
PARLOR IN CHINATOWN

16:55.347 --> 16:57.266
CALLED THE SHANGHAI
DIAMOND GARDEN?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.643
PLEASE, IF I COULD JUST
HAVE MY WALLET --

16:59.643 --> 17:01.311
WE CAN'T DO THAT, DR. OLSEN.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.564
IT WAS PART OF A HOMICIDE
INVESTIGATION.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.358
THE GUY WHO TRIED TO STOP YOU
FROM BEING ROBBED

17:06.358 --> 17:07.693
DIED FROM HIS WOUNDS.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.529
WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK YOU DID
ALL YOU COULD TO HELP.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.116
BUT IF NOT, NOW IS THE TIME
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.367
MEANING?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.119
START BY TELLING US
WHAT YOU SAW LAST NIGHT.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.371
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ANY ROBBERY,

17:19.371 --> 17:23.125
AND I THINK I SHOULD TALK
TO MY ATTORNEY.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.419
WERE YOU A PART
OF THIS ROBBERY, DR. OLSEN?

17:25.419 --> 17:27.087
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

17:27.087 --> 17:28.714
THEN WHY WOULD YOU NEED
A LAWYER?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.591
HELP US, AND WE'LL GET
CONFESSIONS

17:30.591 --> 17:31.759
FROM THESE PERPETRATORS.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.219
NO ONE WILL KNOW
YOU WENT TO THE PLACE,

17:34.219 --> 17:35.512
NO ONE WILL KNOW
YOU COOPERATED.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.639
I THINK I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH MY ATTORNEY.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.684
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.486
THE MAN ASKS FOR AN ATTORNEY,

17:50.486 --> 17:51.987
YOU JUST KEEP ON
LIKE HE NEVER SAID A WORD.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.155
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT
COME OFF IT.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.865
YOU TEACH HIM THAT?
I MIGHT HAVE.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.700
NEXT TIME ME AND HOWERSON
TAKE THE ROOM.

17:56.700 --> 17:57.785
YOU TAKE THE PHONE CALLS.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.952
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:58.952 --> 18:00.287
WASN'T EXACTLY
A SUCCESS IN THERE.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.414
HE WASN'T TALKING NO MATTER WHO
WAS IN THE ROOM.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.749
WE'LL NEVER KNOW,
WILL WE?

18:03.749 --> 18:04.958
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING THIS
THREE HOURS.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.127
WE'VE BEEN ON IT A MONTH.
WE'LL TAKE THE ROOM.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.097
WE CONTACTED AN INDIVIDUAL,
JOSH LAURIE.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.099
REPORTED HIS WALLET STOLEN

18:20.099 --> 18:22.184
THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 2nd
OF THIS YEAR.

18:22.184 --> 18:26.688
THAT WAS THE DAY AFTER
OUR ROBBERY AT, UH...

18:26.688 --> 18:28.440
HOUSE OF LEE MASSAGE
IN THE BRONX.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.068
MR. LAURIE ADMITTED
TO BEING ROBBED,

18:31.068 --> 18:33.403
BUT HE COULDN'T IDENTIFY
THE PERPETRATORS.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.073
HE DID SAY THAT WHEN HE REPORTED
THE CREDIT CARD STOLEN,

18:36.073 --> 18:39.034
THE COMPANY INQUIRED ABOUT
A PURCHASE THAT SAME MORNING

18:39.034 --> 18:41.411
AT AN ELECTRONICS STORE
ON BROOKNER BOULEVARD.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.830
NAME OF THE SHOP IS...

18:42.830 --> 18:47.584
A GUY TRIED TO BUY A BIG-SCREEN
TV WITH LAURIE'S CREDIT CARD.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.086
THE CLERK COULDN'T KEEP HIM
THERE,

18:49.086 --> 18:50.838
BUT WHEN THE GUY SPLIT,
SHE GOT HIS PLATE.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.506
WHO'S THE GUY?

18:52.506 --> 18:55.384
VINCENT PEREZ.
JUNIOR'S LOOKING INTO HIM.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.927
GRAB HIM UP.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.225
HEY...I'VE UPDATED A FEW BOSSES
IN THE LAST 26 YEARS.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.519
IF HE WANTS MORE THAN
THE BARE BONES, HE ASKS.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.938
AND DON'T CALL MY SON "JUNIOR"
IN FRONT OF ME.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.731
PEREZ HAS A RAP SHEET
FOR GRAND LARCENY.

19:09.731 --> 19:10.816
LIVES IN THROGS NECK.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.359
BETWEEN FORDHAM ROAD
AND THE HIGHWAY.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.069
WE GOT A QUICK WAY
IF YOU WANNA FOLLOW.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.362
THEY'LL FIND IT.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.921
YOU EVER HAD
A PARTNER BEFORE?

19:32.921 --> 19:35.174
OF COURSE.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.717
DID YOU KEEP IT
STRICTLY BUSINESS,

19:36.717 --> 19:39.178
OR DID YOU HAPPEN TO CHAT
ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.930
THIS A ROUNDABOUT WAY OF
GETTING TO ME AND MY DAD?

19:41.930 --> 19:44.433
I TALK TO YOU ABOUT CYNTHIA
AND ANDY JR.,

19:44.433 --> 19:47.227
AND IF THEO THROWS A DECENT
PITCH OR BARFS IN SCHOOL,

19:47.227 --> 19:48.520
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.982
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU COULD
DO ABOUT ME AND MY DAD,

19:51.982 --> 19:53.817
I WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT,
BUT YOU CAN'T.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.611
IT DOESN'T MEAN
KEEP IT A SECRET.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.821
YOU'RE NOT A NEUTRAL PARTY.
YOU GUYS HATE EACH OTHER.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.741
I DON'T HATE HIM.
WE JUST--

20:00.741 --> 20:03.118
WE DON'T THINK THE SAME.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.288
NOW WHO'S KEEPING SECRETS?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.748
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU GUYS?

20:07.748 --> 20:11.335
ALL RIGHT. LEGALLY...

20:11.335 --> 20:13.587
WHEN DO YOU READ
A GUY HIS RIGHTS?

20:13.587 --> 20:14.755
SOON AS HE'S
IN CUSTODY.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.548
BEFORE YOU TALK TO HIM
OR AFTER?

20:16.548 --> 20:17.341
BEFORE.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.051
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU DONE THAT?

20:19.051 --> 20:22.012
NEVER. ANYONE WITH HALF A BRAIN
WOULD LAWYER UP. WHY?

20:22.012 --> 20:24.139
WHEN YOUR DAD AND ME
WERE AT THE 2-8,

20:24.139 --> 20:26.975
WE WORKED A ROBBERY
ON AN 84-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

20:26.975 --> 20:28.810
WHO GOT BEAT
WITH THE BUTT OF A GUN.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.895
WE GOT THE PERP IN.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.481
HE GAVE A FULL,
DETAILED CONFESSION.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.857
WHEN I WAS ON THE STAND

20:33.857 --> 20:36.485
AND THE D.A. ASKED IF I ADVISED
THE PERP OF HIS RIGHTS

20:36.485 --> 20:38.320
BEFORE I TALKED TO HIM,
I SAID YES.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.655
YEAH, BUT YOU HADN'T.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.240
WHEN YOUR OLD MAN
GOT ON THE STAND

20:41.240 --> 20:44.826
AND THEY ASKED HIM IF I'D GIVEN
THE PERP HIS RIGHTS WHEN I SAID,

20:44.826 --> 20:47.162
HE SAID HE NEVER HEARD ME
DO IT.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.288
MAYBE HE DIDN'T KNOW BETTER.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.873
OH, HE KNEW BETTER.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.583
SO HE DID IT
TO SPITE YOU?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.710
HE WAS SCARED
OF GETTING CAUGHT IN A LIE,

20:53.710 --> 20:54.836
AND THE CASE WAS TOSSED.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.255
I GAVE HIM HELL FOR IT.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.923
WHEN I DRANK,
I GAVE HIM WORSE HELL --

20:57.923 --> 21:00.092
IN PUBLIC,
IN FRONT OF OTHER COPS.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.470
TWO MONTHS LATER, THE PERP DID
ANOTHER PUSH-IN,

21:03.470 --> 21:04.721
AND AN OLD LADY GOT KILLED.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.140
I GOT DRUNK AND FOUND YOUR DAD
TO FIGHT HIM,

21:07.140 --> 21:09.184
BUT HE WOULDN'T COME OUT
OF THE BAR.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.769
I PUSHED IT WAY TOO FAR.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.606
THE FACT IS
HE TOLD THE ACTUAL TRUTH.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.191
YEAH, WHICH GOT
AN OLD LADY KILLED.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.111
I'M SURE A WEEK DOESN'T PASS
WHEN THAT'S NOT ON HIS MIND.

21:19.111 --> 21:23.240
Unit one to unit two, suspect is
riding up on a gray bicycle.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.242
UNIT TWO MOVING IN.

21:25.242 --> 21:29.621
I'M SURE HE'S GOT HIS VERSION.
THAT'S JUST MINE.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.917
FREEZE! POLICE!

21:33.917 --> 21:35.419
DON'T SHOOT ME!
DON'T SHOOT ME!

21:35.419 --> 21:37.296
I SAID FREEZE,
OR YOU'RE GONNA GET SHOT.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.714
STAY DOWN.
NOBODY'S GONNA SHOOT YOU.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.549
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

21:40.549 --> 21:41.800
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.677
VINCENT PEREZ.
I SWEAR I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.305
HOLD YOUR TONGUE TILL I TELL YOU
DIFFERENTLY, WE'LL BE FRIENDS.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.849
YOU KEEP TALKING,
WE GOT PROBLEMS. UNDERSTAND?

21:48.849 --> 21:51.018
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME!

21:51.018 --> 21:54.896
SUSPECT IS COMING WITH US.
BRIAN?

21:56.732 --> 21:57.983
PERPS RIDING WITH YOU

21:57.983 --> 22:00.360
GOT A HABIT OF GETTING BRUISED
ON THE WAY TO THE HOUSE.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.237
HE TEACH YOU THAT, TOO?

22:02.237 --> 22:03.530
HE'S ALL YOURS.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.293
SODA?

22:16.293 --> 22:17.711
SURE.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.713
NOW, JUST TO CONFIRM, MR. PEREZ,

22:19.713 --> 22:22.090
YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS
AS WE READ THEM TO YOU,

22:22.090 --> 22:24.217
AND YOU'RE WILLING TO TALK
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY PRESENT?

22:24.217 --> 22:26.511
YEAH, AND I THINK I KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.889
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
RELAX.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.057
TAKE IT EASY.
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.433
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.852
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
NOW IF I COULD JUST EXPLAIN --

22:33.852 --> 22:35.854
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO<i> YOU </i>FIRST...

22:35.854 --> 22:39.524
IF HE'D LET HIM,
THE GUY WOULD ROLL.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.650
...ABSOLUTELY READY TO DO.

22:40.650 --> 22:44.029
BUT IF YOU LIE TO US,
OUR HANDS ARE TIED.

22:44.029 --> 22:44.863
UNDERSTOOD.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.239
WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING 2:00 A.M.?

22:46.239 --> 22:49.242
WORK. I'M A STOCK BOY
AT THE SUPERMART.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.453
IS THIS NOT ABOUT
THE CREDIT CARD?

22:51.453 --> 22:53.413
TELL US ABOUT THE CREDIT CARD.

22:53.413 --> 22:57.584
PLEASE, I CAN'T DO
ANY MORE JAIL TIME.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.919
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I GOT IT.

22:58.919 --> 23:02.297
JUST HELP ME OUT...OKAY?

23:02.297 --> 23:03.465
WE'LL SEE.

23:03.465 --> 23:07.469
JULIO ALAMEDA SOLD IT TO ME
FOR 50 BUCKS.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.890
I'VE BEEN OUT OF JAIL SIX MONTHS
AND STRAIGHT, ALL OF IT,

23:11.890 --> 23:15.143
BUT I AIN'T MAKING JACK
AT THE MARKET

23:15.143 --> 23:17.854
AND I WANTED THE SONY
FLAT-SCREEN,

23:17.854 --> 23:19.689
SO I DID SOMETHING STUPID.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.149
WHERE'D ALAMEDA GET
THE CARD?

23:21.149 --> 23:22.317
HE DIDN'T SAY.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.319
HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
BEING A STICKUP MAN?

23:24.319 --> 23:26.321
I DON'T KNOW HIM
REAL GOOD.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.490
AND WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THIS?

23:28.490 --> 23:30.700
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

23:30.700 --> 23:36.039
PLEASE...I REALLY DO NOT WANT
TO GO BACK TO JAIL.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.084
NO PROMISES, BUT WE'LL SEE.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.087
ALAMEDA'S PLACES.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.055
JULIO ALAMEDA.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.390
YEAH, WE HEARD.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.184
HONEY, NOT VINEGAR --
THAT'S WHAT GETS THE BEES.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.282
HAVE A SEAT, CHERYL.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.626
THANK YOU.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.797
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.424
OKAY.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.925
THOSE TWO GOOD SAMARITANS

24:28.925 --> 24:30.302
WHO APPREHENDED
ONE OF THE BURGLARS --

24:30.302 --> 24:32.137
DID YOU SEE THEM
GRAB HIM ON THE STREET?

24:32.137 --> 24:34.139
I DID.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.682
WERE YOU THERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

24:35.682 --> 24:36.975
I WAS.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.102
THEY FOUGHT --
ALL THREE OF THEM?

24:39.102 --> 24:41.646
LIKE BEAR CUBS
IN A GUNNYSACK.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.655
WERE THEY FIGHTING
THE WHOLE TIME,

24:50.655 --> 24:52.282
OR DID THE BURGLAR
EVER QUIT FIGHTING?

24:52.282 --> 24:54.201
HE QUIT, BUT HE KEPT
RUNNING HIS MOUTH,

24:54.201 --> 24:55.619
SO THEY GAVE HIM ONE GOOD.

24:55.619 --> 24:56.661
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

24:56.661 --> 24:59.623
IS THAT ARMANI
OR A KNOCK OFF?

24:59.623 --> 25:01.124
'CAUSE IT'S WORKING
EITHER WAY.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.251
CHERYL. JUST TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

25:03.251 --> 25:05.545
OKAY.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.589
THE BURGLAR DUDE WAS KICKING,
SCREAMING, AND PUNCHING,

25:07.589 --> 25:09.216
THE OTHER GUYS
WERE GIVING IT BACK.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.800
THEY ENDED UP ON THE GROUND,

25:10.800 --> 25:13.470
AND THEN THERE WAS SOME TALKING
BACK AND FORTH,

25:13.470 --> 25:15.388
AND THE BIG WHITE GUY --
WHACK! --

25:15.388 --> 25:18.225
NAILED THE BURGLAR'S HEAD ON
THE CURB, AND THAT SHUT HIM UP.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.685
HOW MANY TIMES DID THE WHITE GUY
WHACK THE BURGLAR'S HEAD?

25:20.685 --> 25:22.812
ONCE. WHY?

25:22.812 --> 25:24.648
'CAUSE THE BURGLAR'S DEAD
BECAUSE OF IT.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.691
WELL SCREW HIM ANYWAY.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.154
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

25:36.868 --> 25:39.204
SO THEY BOTH HAVE THE SUSPECT
ON THE GROUND

25:39.204 --> 25:41.289
AND THE FIGHTING HAD STOPPED?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.083
THEN MacPHERSON KNOCKS
THE SUSPECT'S HEAD ON THE CURB?

25:43.083 --> 25:45.502
REMEMBER, MacPHERSON HAS
INJURIES FROM THIS GUY.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.878
BUT THE FIGHTING HAD STOPPED,

25:46.878 --> 25:48.880
SO MacPHERSON WASN'T
DEFENDING HIMSELF.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.382
THE SUSPECT WAS MOUTHING OFF.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.884
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
THE SUSPECT CAPITULATED.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.219
ALL VIOLENCE HAD CEASED.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.888
NO ONE WAS IN DANGER OF ANY
PHYSICAL HARM AT THIS POINT.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.057
MacPHERSON COMMITTED AN
AGGRESSIVE ACT

25:59.057 --> 26:01.142
THAT LED
TO THE SUSPECT'S DEATH,

26:01.142 --> 26:03.603
AND THAT ACT CONSTITUTES
DEADLY PHYSICAL FORCE

26:03.603 --> 26:04.729
UNDER THE PENAL LAW.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.939
SO, WHAT'S HE LOOKING AT?

26:05.939 --> 26:07.774
MANSLAUGHTER, FIRST DEGREE,
"B" FELONY.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.234
MANDATORY JAIL TIME.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.735
RIGHT.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.696
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUY,
EWELL?

26:12.696 --> 26:16.032
HE WAS HOLDING THE SUSPECT DOWN
WHEN MacPHERSON HIT HIS HEAD.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.784
ACTING IN CONCERT,
EQUALLY CULPABLE,

26:17.784 --> 26:19.119
SO THAT'S MANSLAUGHTER TOO.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.870
BUT NO MANDATORY JAIL TIME.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.456
POSSIBLY PROBATION IF HE
TESTIFIES AGAINST MacPHERSON.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.250
LET'S BRING THEM BOTH IN.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.919
THIS IS WHY I SIGNED UP
FOR THIS JOB.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.723
HAVE A SEAT.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.809
WE NEED TO TALK MORE ABOUT WHEN
YOU DETAINED THAT GUY.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.604
OKAY. HOW'S THE OLD LADY?
SHE'S FINE.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.188
WHO STARTED THROWING PUNCHES?

26:47.188 --> 26:49.024
HE DID -- THROWING ELBOWS.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.525
ANYBODY HIT HIM IN THE HEAD?

26:50.525 --> 26:53.695
I HIT HIM IN THE JAW A FEW TIMES
AFTER HE CONNECTED ON ME.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.864
STANDING UP?
WE ENDED UP ON THE GROUND.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.033
YOU FOUND THE SCUMBAG
HE DID IT WITH YET?

26:58.033 --> 26:59.075
YEAH, HE'S LOCKED UP.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.494
SO WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

27:01.494 --> 27:03.288
HE HAVE A GUN
OR A KNIFE ON HIM?

27:03.288 --> 27:05.123
NO. WHEN THE OTHER GUY
HELPING OUT

27:05.123 --> 27:08.126
HELD THAT DICKHEAD'S ARMS BACK,
I PATTED HIM DOWN TO MAKE SURE.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.045
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
HE DIED.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.762
FROM WHAT HAPPENED ON THE
STREET?

27:18.762 --> 27:19.721
THEY THINK SO.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.556
WHAT, LIKE, A HEART ATTACK?

27:21.556 --> 27:22.682
BRAIN INJURY.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.643
HE LOOKED FINE
WHEN THEY TOOK HIM AWAY.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.727
HE WAS WALKING AROUND.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.646
DID HE HIT HIS HEAD WHEN
YOU WERE FIGHTING?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.147
NO. I DON'T KNOW.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.859
LOOK, THERE WAS AN OLD LADY
SCREAMING OUT THE WINDOW,

27:32.859 --> 27:34.694
AND I HELPED OUT.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.529
I GOT KICKED AND HIT
IN THE PROCESS.

27:36.529 --> 27:39.824
THERE WAS A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE
ON THE STREET JUST WATCHING.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.076
ME AND THAT BLACK GUY

27:41.076 --> 27:43.453
ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT DID
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.790
NOW YOU COME AT ME WITH THIS?
AM I UNDER ARREST?

27:46.790 --> 27:48.458
NO, JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.418
I TOLD YOU.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.765
[ TIRES SCREECH ]

28:05.642 --> 28:08.603
PLEASE, MR. ALAMEDA,
DO NOT MOVE.

28:08.603 --> 28:09.521
SON OF A BITCH.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.947
[ TIRES SCREECH, HORN HONKS ]

28:27.997 --> 28:30.417
WHAT'D YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING
HITTING A COP?!

28:30.417 --> 28:32.544
YOU DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D GET HIT BACK?!

28:32.544 --> 28:34.129
POLICE BRUTALITY!

28:34.129 --> 28:35.630
DON'T YOU HIT HIM!

28:35.630 --> 28:37.340
LET'S GET OFF THE STREET.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.634
I DIDN'T.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.761
WE GOT THIS GUY.
HE'S OURS FROM NOW ON.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.471
WAIT UNTIL ME AND JOHN HAVE
ANOTHER CONVERSATION

28:43.471 --> 28:44.472
WITH THE DOCTOR.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.890
THE DOCTOR LAWYERED UP.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.726
HE'S GONNA LAWYER UP AGAIN.
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.394
HOW CAN COVERING OUR BASES
BE A WASTE OF TIME?

28:49.394 --> 28:50.895
YOU COVER THEM.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN HOUR.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.106
HOW ABOUT YOU WAIT
TILL WE GET BACK?

29:08.538 --> 29:10.999
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:10.999 --> 29:13.918
WE NEED ANOTHER MINUTE OF YOUR
TIME, DOCTOR.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.092
I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING MORE TO SAY.

29:21.092 --> 29:24.095
WE GOT A HOMICIDE TO SOLVE,
SO WE CAN TALK IN PRIVATE

29:24.095 --> 29:26.139
OR AIR YOUR WHORING OUT
IN FRONT OF YOUR PATIENTS.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.725
THEN WE COULD HEAD OUT TO
WESTCHESTER, TALK TO YOUR WIFE.

29:28.725 --> 29:29.642
THAT'S BLACKMAIL.

29:29.642 --> 29:32.270
YOU SHOULD BE SICK WITH YOURSELF
THAT WE GOTTA THREATEN YOU,

29:32.270 --> 29:35.732
WHERE IF YOU'D HAVE FOLLOWED
YOUR OATH AND STUCK AROUND,

29:35.732 --> 29:37.567
YOU PROBABLY COULD HAVE
SAVED THAT GUY'S LIFE.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.861
HE HAD A BULLET IN HIS BRAIN.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.071
HE HAD NO PULSE.
HE WAS DEAD.

29:42.071 --> 29:44.365
JUST TELL US IF YOU SAW ANY OF
THESE GUYS ROB

29:44.365 --> 29:46.493
THE SHANGHAI DIAMOND GARDEN LAST
NIGHT, AND WE'RE GONE.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.711
HIM. DONE?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.588
WAS HE THE SHOOTER?

29:58.588 --> 30:01.174
HE WAS WHO HIT THE WOMAN
IN THE FRONT.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.717
I REALLY HAVE TO GO NOW.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.387
WE APPRECIATE IT.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.022
HAVE A SEAT, MR. EWELL.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.525
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:18.525 --> 30:20.985
WE'VE ENCOUNTERED A BIT
OF A PROBLEM, MR. EWELL.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.320
NAMELY?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.531
THE GUY YOU AND MR. MacPHERSON
DETAINED AT THE SCENE --

30:24.531 --> 30:26.032
HE DIED AS A RESULT

30:26.032 --> 30:27.992
OF MR. MacPHERSON SLAMMING
HIS HEAD AGAINST THE CURB.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.369
HE WAS TIRED OF THAT PRICK

30:29.369 --> 30:31.120
CUSSING AND FIGHTING
AND KICKING US.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.582
WAS HE KICKING AND FIGHTING WHEN
MR. MacPHERSON SLAMMED HIS HEAD?

30:34.582 --> 30:37.335
YOU MEAN,
AT THAT MOMENT?

30:37.335 --> 30:40.505
HE AIN'T LOOKING AT NO CHARGES
BROUGHT AGAINST HIM, IS HE?
