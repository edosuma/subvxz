WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.

08:57.406 --> 09:02.498
YOU KNOW, I'VE COLLARED
LOTS OF CON MEN OVER THE YEARS,

09:02.629 --> 09:04.544
BEST IN THE BUSINESS.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.546
YOU KNOW WHAT LED
TO THEIR DOWNFALL ULTIMATELY?

09:06.676 --> 09:08.939
YEAH. THEY START BELIEVING
THEIR OWN CON.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.551
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
THERE IS NO CON HERE.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.074
NO?

09:13.204 --> 09:14.075
NO.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.033
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.092
MR. JANE, YOU UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
UNDER A WAIVER OF IMMUNITY.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.268
YES, MA'AM.WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?

09:33.398 --> 09:36.619
UH, IT MEANS THAT ANYTHING I SAY
MAY BE HELD AGAINST ME.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.664
VERY GOOD.

09:38.882 --> 09:39.796
IN A MOMENT,
I'LL OPEN THE FLOOR UP TO YOU

09:40.971 --> 09:41.842
SO YOU CAN PROVIDE
A NARRATIVE OF EVENTS

09:43.191 --> 09:44.192
TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING
AND WHERE YOU WERE

09:45.585 --> 09:47.282
ON THE DATE AND TIME
OF THOMAS McALLISTER'S MURDER.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.936
OBJECTION.
YOU SAID "MURDER."

09:49.066 --> 09:51.765
THOMAS McALLISTER MAY HAVE
SHOT AND STRANGLED HIMSELF.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.201
THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS HERE,
MR. JANE,

09:53.331 --> 09:55.333
NO JUDGE,
JUST A FRIENDLY INQUIRY.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.292
BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT.

09:57.422 --> 10:00.469
DO YOU RECALL
THE DAY OF McALLISTER'S DEATH?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.777
I DO -- BIG DAY.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.606
I HAD BEEN CHASING THE MAN
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.783

10:09.913 --> 10:11.523
TO BE DRIVEN
BY A MORAL IMPERATIVE?

10:11.654 --> 10:13.003
YOU DO.

10:13.134 --> 10:13.874

I'M ESTABLISHING A NARRATIVE
OF EVENTS, AS YOU ASKED.

WITH THIS?

IF YOU'LL JUST LET ME.

EVEN STARTED IT.

THIS GENTLEMEN HERE,

10:47.951 --> 10:49.823
WHO'S PREOCCUPIED
BY HIS NEW JACKET.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.042
THAT'S A LITTLE VAIN
AND CHILDISH, DON'T YOU THINK?

10:52.173 --> 10:53.827
THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS.
PAY ATTENTION.

10:53.957 --> 10:54.871
I'M SORRY.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.873

INDULGE HIM.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.614
WELL, HE'S HAPPY TO INDULGE
HIMSELF.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.182
T-THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY
BE ON THE RECORD.

11:01.312 --> 11:04.664
MR. JANE, THIS IS NOT A FORUM
FOR YOU TO CHAT WITH THE JURORS.

THAT GENTLEMAN ON THE END THERE.

MEND THINGS WITH YOUR SON.

THIS RESENTMENT

11:16.153 --> 11:17.720

IT'S RUINING BOTH YOUR LIVES.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.853
STOP NOW.

THE AGENDA HERE.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.209
THIS IS MY COURTROOM,
AND IT RUNS THE WAY I SAY.

11:28.339 --> 11:29.601

11:42.397 --> 11:43.006
THERE IS NO ONE IN THAT
COURTROOM KEEPING HER IN CHECK.

11:44.486 --> 11:45.487
JOHN ACARDO DIDN'T PAY OFF
JURORS TO AVOID PROSECUTION.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.054
HE JUST PAID OFF
THE PROSECUTOR.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.359
WELL, THEORETICALLY,

11:48.490 --> 11:51.058
A PROSECUTOR COULD THROW
AN INVESTIGATION,

11:51.188 --> 11:53.887
ESPECIALLY ONE
WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.584
I'LL OBTAIN THE TRANSCRIPT.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.239
MM...FAULK'S TOO SMART
TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.068
IT WOULD BE IN THE WAY
SHE PRESENTED THE CASE.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.332
HALFHEARTEDLY,
LACKING CONFIDENCE.

12:04.462 --> 12:07.117
JURY WOULD SEE DEFEAT IN
HER EYES AND VOTE ACCORDINGLY.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.728
SO, WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

12:08.858 --> 12:09.729
A NEW STRATEGY.

12:09.859 --> 12:10.991
WE NEED TO PROVE

12:12.340 --> 12:13.733
THAT JOHN ACARDO
IS GUILTY OF MURDER OURSELVES.

12:13.863 --> 12:18.128
JANE BELIEVES THAT ACARDO
DIDN'T GET TO THE JURY.

12:18.259 --> 12:21.262
HE GOT TO FAULK,
THE PROSECUTOR.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.959
SO NOW WE HAVE TWO TARGETS.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.265
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:25.657 --> 12:26.310
AND TO TAKE THEM DOWN,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND PROOF

12:27.616 --> 12:28.225
THAT ACARDO WAS BEHIND
THE ELIJAH MACY SHOOTING.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.271
WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE?

12:30.401 --> 12:31.228
EARLIER THIS YEAR,

12:32.273 --> 12:32.752
ONE OF ACARDO'S MEN
WAS ARRESTED,

12:34.231 --> 12:35.276
TURNED STATE'S EVIDENCE
FOR IMMUNITY FROM A DRUG CHARGE.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.497
HE ALSO TESTIFIED THAT HIS BOSS
ORDER THE HIT ON MACY.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.849
MULTIPLE WITNESSES HEARD ACARDO
THREATEN TO HAVE MACY KILLED

12:42.979 --> 12:45.765
IF HE DIDN'T SHUT DOWN
HIS SPORTS-BETTING WEBSITE.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.114
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.419
NOT YET.

12:48.550 --> 12:49.769
BUT THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.553
WELL, ACCORDING TO
THE TRANSCRIPT,

12:51.683 --> 12:54.208
ACARDO CLAIMS HE WAS AT A PLACE
CALLED IL TAVOLO BIANCO

12:54.338 --> 12:55.426

12:56.863 --> 12:58.125

YEAH, BUT HE DRONES
ON AND ON ABOUT IT

13:00.344 --> 13:02.129
AFTER IT WAS ALREADY
IN THE RECORD.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.695
HE KEEPS TALKING
ABOUT THE RESTAURANT

13:03.826 --> 13:05.306
BECAUSE HE'S HIDING EVIDENCE
OF HIS GUILT.

THIS IL TAVOLO BIANCO?

13:13.531 --> 13:15.272

WHAT THAT MEANS.

WITH YOUR BLOOD TEST.
