11:13.125 --> 11:16.083
Diploma? You're expelled!

11:19.417 --> 11:23.125
Please, give me a second chance.

11:23.208 --> 11:26.625
No. You're expelled, and that's final.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.625
But there's my reunion.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.166
The old gang's gonna be there.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.917
It's just a party.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.083
No.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.500
[thump]

11:35.583 --> 11:38.500
I want to see my old friends.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.166
Have a heart.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.875
I'd rather have my circulation back
in my ankles.

11:42.959 --> 11:46.542
All right. I'll give you another chance.

11:46.959 --> 11:49.583
Be here Saturday, 9:00 sharp.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.417
[sighs]

11:53.792 --> 11:55.667
He'll give me an equivalency test.

11:55.750 --> 12:00.291
If I pass, I get my sheepskin
and attend the reunion.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.333
Great.

12:02.417 --> 12:06.041
[Baloo] What's an equivalency test?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.792
A test of the whole year's work.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.750
I'll never pass.

12:10.834 --> 12:14.083
How's this old dog going to learn
that many new tricks?

12:14.166 --> 12:15.333
[Kit] Get a tutor.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.709
[Baloo] Who? Can't ask Rebecca.

12:17.792 --> 12:21.083
Wildcat doesn't know the sixth grade
from a socket wrench.

12:21.166 --> 12:24.000
That only leaves you.

12:24.083 --> 12:27.667
-Me?
-You are my study buddy.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.417
[Kit] Let's start with English.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.959
Any problems with dangling participles?

12:32.041 --> 12:34.458
Hey, no smart talk.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.250
Well, then, can you conjugate verbs?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.542
That is none of your business.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.458
Baloo, cut it out.

12:42.542 --> 12:43.875
What's the use?

12:43.959 --> 12:48.500
I'm just a dumb pilot
who only knows planes.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.625
Then planes it is.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.125
That's how you'll learn.

12:52.208 --> 12:55.417
I'm not picking you up on my radar.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.625
Well, take verbs, for instance.

12:57.709 --> 13:00.917
They're sort of like airplane propellers.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.583
They make a sentence move.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.709
Now you're talking my language.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.583
Let's try math.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.333
What's 10,000 minus 4,000?

13:10.917 --> 13:12.083
Beats me.

13:18.792 --> 13:22.083
Hey, stop! We just dropped 6,000 feet!

13:23.792 --> 13:26.083
Congratulations!

13:26.166 --> 13:27.166
You just subtracted.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.625
I did?

13:28.709 --> 13:31.083
Now we're about to be divided!

13:31.166 --> 13:32.083
[horn blowing]

13:32.166 --> 13:33.959
-Whoa!
-Aah!

13:34.083 --> 13:36.875
Aah!

13:37.875 --> 13:38.709
[Kit] Whew.

13:38.792 --> 13:42.500
[Baloo] Don't ever do math
in my plane again.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.375
[ringing]

14:09.625 --> 14:11.792
[seagulls cawing]

14:19.000 --> 14:21.875
[inaudible]

14:27.625 --> 14:28.667
[inaudible conversation]

14:33.417 --> 14:35.667
I've asked you three times

14:35.750 --> 14:37.458
to deliver these thermometers to the--

14:37.542 --> 14:39.625
You know deliver's a verb?

14:39.709 --> 14:42.667
I know another verb... fired.

14:42.750 --> 14:45.208
You'll be fired
if you don't deliver these.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.917
I'm busy, lady.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.750
Busy goofing off.

14:49.834 --> 14:52.542
Is this a hardback comic book?

14:54.041 --> 14:57.166
"Basic English for sixth graders."

15:00.458 --> 15:02.709
You went back to school.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.375
For my diploma.

15:04.458 --> 15:07.417
That's why you've been messing up.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
I'll be finished tomorrow. Promise.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.959
I have one thing to say.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.291
Here it comes.

15:14.375 --> 15:17.792
I think it's great! Good for you!

15:17.875 --> 15:21.625
Study hard and take tomorrow off.

15:21.709 --> 15:25.750
You're a class act, Beckers.

15:31.792 --> 15:35.625
[Baloo] Add the two, then carry the three.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.875
Baloo? You got to get some rest.

15:41.959 --> 15:44.417
Tomorrow's a big day.

15:46.625 --> 15:50.542
No sweat. I'll be bright-tailed
and bushy-eyed.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.041
[snoring]

15:56.834 --> 15:59.125
[Rebecca] Up and at 'em, Baloo!

15:59.208 --> 16:01.625
Come on. Get up.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.333
I'll get up in an itsy-bitsy,

16:05.417 --> 16:07.792
teensy-weensy minute.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.208
Huh? Who? What?

16:13.291 --> 16:15.709
You'll be late for your test.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.375
The test!

16:17.458 --> 16:18.834
[ringing]

16:18.917 --> 16:21.709
Mother matriculation!

16:21.792 --> 16:24.417
[Mr. Pomeroy]
If Baloo's not here in one minute,

16:24.500 --> 16:25.917
he's out of luck.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.875
I've got bigger fish to fry.

16:29.959 --> 16:33.166
Mt. Neverest is 2,000 feet tall.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.959
Five plus one equals six.

16:36.041 --> 16:38.625
Famous Apache Indian chief was named--

16:38.709 --> 16:42.542
Geronimo!

16:42.625 --> 16:43.625
That's it, that's it.

16:43.709 --> 16:46.500
Baloo blew his chance.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.667
Aah!

16:48.750 --> 16:50.291
[crashing]

16:50.375 --> 16:51.667
Oh!

17:01.458 --> 17:03.750
[tense music playing]

17:05.333 --> 17:08.250
[footsteps approaching]

17:13.375 --> 17:15.959
And... you've got one hour.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.333
[Mr. Pomeroy] Let's see.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.500
Time's up, Baloo.

17:56.583 --> 17:57.875
Ouch!

18:03.667 --> 18:05.667
I'll grade it Monday.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.375
But the reunion's tonight.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.542
Please, grade it now.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.250
I'm begging, imploring,

18:11.333 --> 18:13.417
and committing various other verbs.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.166
Oh... very well.

18:22.959 --> 18:25.458
Well, Baloo, you surprised me.

18:27.417 --> 18:30.333
You did better than I expected.

18:30.417 --> 18:34.250
-Hot-diggity! Class reunion, here I come!
-[whistling]

18:34.333 --> 18:36.709
You only failed by one question.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.250
Better luck next time.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.959
[Rebecca sighs] You should feel proud.

18:55.041 --> 18:57.375
You only missed by one answer.

18:57.458 --> 19:01.417
One, 21, what's the difference? I blew it.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.834
Wait a minute.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.500
That answer's not wrong.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.291
What's the best place

19:07.375 --> 19:09.250
for fly-fishing in Cape Suzette?

19:09.333 --> 19:12.542
Uh... Veronica Lake, I guess.

19:12.625 --> 19:13.458
Why?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.875
[Mr. Pomeroy] Ah... this is the life.

19:18.959 --> 19:21.959
Perfect tranquility and serenity.

19:22.417 --> 19:24.917
[Sea Duck approaching]

19:25.000 --> 19:27.875
Aah!

19:29.083 --> 19:32.250
Ah. Mi-- missed me.

19:33.583 --> 19:34.917
[coughing]

19:35.125 --> 19:36.959
That-- Baloo!

19:37.041 --> 19:41.709
Sorry, but we have a date
with a kumquat tree.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.792
Hey!

19:45.250 --> 19:47.667
[Mr. Pomeroy]
You're in big trouble, buster.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.750
[Baloo] What can you do, expel me?

19:51.875 --> 19:55.166
[Mr. Pomeroy]
The Formosa Mountains! Are you crazy?

19:55.250 --> 19:56.583
Why are we here?

19:56.667 --> 19:59.458
Proving I got question 43 right.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.500
"What grows atop Mt. Neverest?"

20:03.583 --> 20:05.125
You wrote kumquats.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.083
The correct answer is nothing.

20:07.166 --> 20:10.375
There's kumquats in them the hills.

20:10.458 --> 20:11.667
I seen 'em.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.625
[Baloo] There she is. Mt. Neverest.

20:22.709 --> 20:25.792
[Mr. Pomeroy]
It's-- it's a blizzard. Turn back.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.417
No. I'm going to show you

20:28.500 --> 20:31.083
the juiciest kumquats you've ever seen.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.834
Uh-oh. What happened to all of the trees?

20:41.917 --> 20:45.542
Maybe now you'll believe
what the textbooks say.

20:45.625 --> 20:49.166
Oh, but I was positively certain.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.583
Now I'll never see my buddies.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.709
Wait. What's that?

21:04.291 --> 21:06.333
Blow, snow, blow.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.625
I don't believe it.

21:13.709 --> 21:16.875
A purtier kumquat tree I've never seen.

21:16.959 --> 21:18.959
Well, Baloo...

21:20.125 --> 21:22.291
How can I make this up to you?

21:22.375 --> 21:25.041
With a passing grade, prince old pal.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.834
[laughing]

21:33.125 --> 21:37.875
[laughs] Have a crazy time at the reunion,
you glad grads.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.000
Oh, sorry, Fuzzy.

21:41.083 --> 21:42.792
You know the rules.

21:42.875 --> 21:46.458
Yeah. I came out of my coma

21:46.542 --> 21:48.250
and got my diploma.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.959
My main magna cum loud mouth!
[laughing]

21:52.041 --> 21:54.208
Congratulations, grad.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.542
[Crazy Eddie] Gee, it's Baloo.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.041
Baloo!

21:58.125 --> 22:00.291
Hey, Crazy Eddie,

22:00.375 --> 22:03.250
