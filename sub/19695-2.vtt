00:00.047 --> 00:01.548
Previously on "Shades of Blue":

00:01.550 --> 00:02.549
Come on, almost a year now

00:02.551 --> 00:03.383
we've been together.

00:03.385 --> 00:05.218
I wanna be with you, Matt.

00:05.220 --> 00:06.553
There's something you should see.

00:06.555 --> 00:07.888
Donnie's dead.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.990
Loman killed him in self-defense.

00:09.992 --> 00:11.825
Internal Affairs looks after their own.

00:11.827 --> 00:13.160
Same as us.

00:13.162 --> 00:16.163
She's an escort,
she says he calls her Harlee.

00:16.165 --> 00:17.197
Where do you want it?

00:17.199 --> 00:18.331
Camera in the bedroom, I guess.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.499
Who's in charge, Harlee?

00:19.501 --> 00:20.800
You own me.

00:20.802 --> 00:22.469
What is it you want?

00:22.471 --> 00:23.470
I Could use a dirty cop.

00:23.472 --> 00:24.804
What did you agree to do?

00:26.642 --> 00:27.974
Interesting dining utensil.

00:27.976 --> 00:29.476
Smooth plant, sweetheart.

00:29.478 --> 00:30.810
The Mafia isn't your target.

00:30.812 --> 00:32.812
- Gold star, Detective.
- Then who is?

00:32.814 --> 00:34.214
So what's the occasion?

00:34.216 --> 00:36.149
Have you signed the file on Bianchi?

00:36.151 --> 00:37.651
If you were to drop the charges...

00:37.653 --> 00:39.319
Jules, I can't.

00:39.321 --> 00:41.321
The U.S. Attorney
had his DNA on the weapon.

00:41.323 --> 00:42.989
Then why isn't he doing life upstate?

00:42.991 --> 00:44.324
Hurricane Sandy.

00:44.326 --> 00:45.659
Evidence was lost in the floodage.

00:45.661 --> 00:48.361
You wore a wire, and you're a rat!

00:48.363 --> 00:50.401
I will never trust you again.

You're a liar, you're a coward,

01:02.044 --> 01:04.044
and you're a rat!

01:08.717 --> 01:10.383
I will never trust you again.

01:12.387 --> 01:13.864
Ever.

01:51.093 --> 01:53.361
I thought I beat you here.

01:55.097 --> 01:57.597
You want to share a piece
of banana cream?

01:57.599 --> 01:59.217
I'm good.

02:00.569 --> 02:01.850
You got here early.

02:01.852 --> 02:03.403
Won't eat.

02:03.741 --> 02:05.640
Took the seat facing the door.

02:06.741 --> 02:08.041
What is this? A cop meeting?

02:08.429 --> 02:10.043
We're a couple of cops, aren't we?

02:10.044 --> 02:11.878
Well, it doesn't have
to be banana cream.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.868
I'm willing to negotiate.

02:16.285 --> 02:17.989
Just not blueberry.

02:25.093 --> 02:28.245
I asked you here so you can translate.

02:28.930 --> 02:30.862
I don't speak rat.

02:31.933 --> 02:35.268
Well, it's nice to see
you two have made up.

02:35.270 --> 02:39.606
I'd hate for bad blood
to come between good people.

02:39.608 --> 02:41.441
There's nothing like a common threat

02:41.443 --> 02:42.609
to bring people together.

02:42.611 --> 02:44.110
I'm sorry to upset your common ground,

02:44.112 --> 02:46.112
but you and I are square, remember?

02:46.114 --> 02:49.853
And if you'll excuse us,
my asset and I have a meeting.

03:00.729 --> 03:02.829
You keep his calendar too?
Because it's proven hard

03:02.831 --> 03:04.831
to get an audience for
the past three weeks.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.904
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

03:07.893 --> 03:10.337
I told you a corrupt politician
was gonna come to you

03:10.339 --> 03:12.339
asking to let the mobster walk.

03:12.341 --> 03:14.674
You and your merry band of
dirty cops are walking around,

03:14.676 --> 03:17.177
breathing free air because
you agreed to deliver

03:17.179 --> 03:19.179
that politician to me.

03:19.488 --> 03:21.576
One bone and rib eye steak,

03:22.535 --> 03:24.351
blueberry pie,

03:24.353 --> 03:28.355
and one child's Wily Smiley Short Stack.

03:28.357 --> 03:30.790
I went ahead and ordered for us.

03:32.896 --> 03:35.528
She was seen entering your
precinct and asking for you

03:35.530 --> 03:38.198
a day after Bianchi's arrest,
and yet I can't seem to get

03:38.200 --> 03:40.887
so much as a return phone call from you.

03:43.672 --> 03:45.572
I'll give you a hint because I can tell

03:45.574 --> 03:47.574
you're having trouble with this.

03:47.902 --> 03:49.370
Give me a name.

03:50.245 --> 03:51.745
I'll give you a name.

03:51.747 --> 03:53.747
Harlee Santos.
Witness for the prosecution,

03:53.749 --> 03:55.749
appearing in court tomorrow
to perjure herself

03:55.751 --> 03:57.384
in a mob case...

03:57.742 --> 04:00.186
- thanks to you.
- We all have our skill sets.

04:00.601 --> 04:02.522
I'm guessing that
Councilwoman Julia Ayres

04:02.524 --> 04:05.625
will be following this hearing closely.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.167
That's Woz-speak for,

04:14.169 --> 04:15.835
"I won't say anything about Julia,

04:15.837 --> 04:17.837
"and I would never
would've made this deal

04:17.839 --> 04:19.172
if you hadn't lied to me."

04:19.173 --> 04:21.173
I did not lie to him;
I offered him a way out.

04:21.176 --> 04:23.543
Of a trap that you set.

04:23.714 --> 04:25.378
Julia's one of us.

04:25.380 --> 04:27.213
You knew that he would never
agree to take her down.

04:27.215 --> 04:28.715
Sounds like you'd rather
see him in prison.

04:28.717 --> 04:30.216
We have already framed

04:30.218 --> 04:32.218
a high-value Mafia target for you.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.553
You're the FBI.

04:33.555 --> 04:35.555
You want to go after our friend Julia?

04:35.557 --> 04:36.890
Do it yourself.

04:36.892 --> 04:39.392
How do you think we at
the FBI do that, Harlee?

04:39.394 --> 04:41.561
Undercover operations, surveillance...

04:41.563 --> 04:43.062
and through informants.

04:43.064 --> 04:44.847
You know what I miss?

04:45.862 --> 04:47.567
Jukeboxes.

04:47.937 --> 04:50.203
Every diner used to have a jukebox.

04:50.641 --> 04:53.306
All the classics for a quarter.

04:56.857 --> 04:58.545
You can go hump your fist
would be my translation.

05:00.903 --> 05:03.183
You know why diners don't have
jukeboxes anymore, Detective?

05:03.185 --> 05:04.350
They're irrelevant.

05:04.352 --> 05:05.885
Nostalgia's nice,

05:05.887 --> 05:07.554
but it's not gonna help you
escape the present,

05:07.556 --> 05:09.722
and presently, you are an FBI asset

05:09.724 --> 05:10.890
who's made a commitment.

05:10.892 --> 05:14.151
I just like pushing buttons.

05:14.944 --> 05:17.230
I don't need a translation.

05:17.672 --> 05:19.232
Do the job you agreed to do,

05:19.234 --> 05:21.234
or you and your devoted crew
are gonna be strolling down

05:21.236 --> 05:25.048
memory lane from your 6x8 cement rooms.

05:26.473 --> 05:28.328
Interpret that.

05:32.047 --> 05:35.048
How long do you think ordering
from the kids menu will work?

05:35.050 --> 05:38.384
Everyone's got a family to protect.

05:38.386 --> 05:42.136
He's fighting for his kid
in court right now.

05:42.891 --> 05:44.295
Pay the check.

05:44.297 --> 05:46.340
I have played Stahl's game.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.276
He doesn't bluff.

05:55.949 --> 05:57.591
Neither do I.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.871
Do you swear to tell the truth,

06:08.873 --> 06:10.840
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

06:10.842 --> 06:11.974
so help you God?

06:11.976 --> 06:12.975
I do.

06:18.950 --> 06:20.287
Detective Santos.

06:21.586 --> 06:22.752
Morning.

06:25.556 --> 06:27.639
Good morning to you, too.

06:28.559 --> 06:30.026
I'll call you an Uber.

06:30.028 --> 06:31.854
Excuse me?

06:32.730 --> 06:35.865
I got a big direct
examination today in court.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.167
Some hard-nosed detective.

06:38.169 --> 06:39.502
How did you and Lieutenant Wozniak

06:39.504 --> 06:41.137
come upon the attack?

06:41.139 --> 06:43.639
We were talking to
a confidential informant

06:43.641 --> 06:44.940
in the neighborhood when we heard

06:44.942 --> 06:46.727
the sounds of a struggle.

06:47.612 --> 06:49.578
Does this scar have a story?

06:49.580 --> 06:51.747
Mm, don't they all?

06:51.749 --> 06:53.686
It was, uh...

06:54.218 --> 06:56.218
surgery. I was sixteen.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.553
Cheerleading injury?

06:57.555 --> 07:01.023
Now I wanna call you an Uber.

07:01.025 --> 07:02.525
I was on the field,
not on the sidelines.

07:02.527 --> 07:04.326
Running track.

07:04.328 --> 07:05.661
Were you fast?

07:05.663 --> 07:06.996
I am fast.

07:06.998 --> 07:09.965
We ran to help, and we found Mr. Russel.

07:09.967 --> 07:11.634
What caused you and Lieutenant Wozniak

07:11.636 --> 07:13.436
to enter the restaurant
before patrolmen arrived?

07:13.438 --> 07:15.471
We discovered what
appeared to be fresh blood

07:15.473 --> 07:17.473
on the back entrance.

07:17.941 --> 07:20.776
We entered concerned that
there might be other victims.

07:21.109 --> 07:22.278
Did you find any?

07:22.280 --> 07:25.748
You are looking at the PSAL
Brooklyn Borough Champion

07:25.750 --> 07:28.050
in the 100 and 400.

07:28.052 --> 07:29.218
Records still stand.

07:29.220 --> 07:30.686
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:30.688 --> 07:33.155
- Why'd you hang up the cleats?
- Uh.

07:33.597 --> 07:34.657
That.

07:35.085 --> 07:36.492
My knee was sore. I was stubborn,

07:36.494 --> 07:39.266
and I still had the 4x200 relay to run.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.331
Ouch.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.630
You hurt it on the last race?

07:41.632 --> 07:44.600
That's what I told everybody,
but I actually hurt it

07:44.602 --> 07:46.564
during warm-ups.

07:46.612 --> 07:48.237
And you ran anyway?

07:48.646 --> 07:50.072
I was the anchor.

07:50.551 --> 07:52.402
It was my job to bring it home.

07:52.427 --> 07:54.423
Once inside,
you discovered the defendant,

07:54.448 --> 07:56.178
Mr. Bianchi, right?

07:56.725 --> 07:58.247
That's right.

07:58.706 --> 08:02.151
I searched him and I found
the weapon on his person.

08:02.627 --> 08:04.361
A leather sap with blood on it.

08:11.641 --> 08:13.485
What about this one?

08:16.817 --> 08:19.735
Some scars don't have
such a happy story.

08:20.283 --> 08:21.867
No further questions, Your Honor.

08:21.965 --> 08:23.672
I have a question.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.892
Detective, did you or Lieutenant Wozniak

08:26.917 --> 08:29.251
actually see Mr. Bianchi
attack the victim?

08:29.253 --> 08:31.220
No, we only saw him enter.

08:31.222 --> 08:32.554
Did the victim himself

08:32.556 --> 08:34.722
give you a description of Mr. Bianchi?

08:34.725 --> 08:36.357
The victim was unconscious.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.360
We didn't have time
to wait for a statement.

08:38.361 --> 08:40.610
Due respect, Your Honor,
the victim's identification

08:40.611 --> 08:42.030
has no bearing on
admissibility of evidence.

08:42.032 --> 08:43.866
I understand the law, counselor.

08:43.868 --> 08:46.335
I also understand that
the blood found on the door,

08:46.337 --> 08:48.504
which detectives cited as justification

08:48.506 --> 08:50.168
for probable cause,

08:50.170 --> 08:52.141
had no direct connection to Mr. Bianchi.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.443
In fact, they lacked
any evidence indentifying

08:54.445 --> 08:57.063
the defendant as a suspect
before they searched him.

08:57.065 --> 08:58.383
- Your Honor...
- Ah!

08:58.385 --> 08:59.948
Which makes the weapon
they found during their search

08:59.950 --> 09:01.450
inadmissible.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.452
Defense's motion to suppress granted.

09:11.528 --> 09:13.228
What piece comes next?

09:13.780 --> 09:15.257
Daddy? Hm?

09:15.259 --> 09:16.954
What piece comes next?

09:18.921 --> 09:20.442
Teeter-totter.

09:27.369 --> 09:29.081
Daddy, it doesn't work.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.065
Well, let's see.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.825
Um...

09:36.444 --> 09:38.179
Look, here's your problem.

09:40.156 --> 09:42.009
You don't have enough force here...

09:42.665 --> 09:46.980
to get this first piece moving... see?

09:47.753 --> 09:48.862
And that's key.

09:48.864 --> 09:52.419
You need the right amount
of force in the right place

09:52.869 --> 09:55.706
to get all the pieces to move
exactly how you want them to,

09:55.708 --> 09:59.825
and that piece gets the next
one moving, and so on,

09:59.827 --> 10:03.697
and you get the proper reaction,
but you gotta make sure that...

10:04.601 --> 10:07.873
everything's planned out before
you even set things in motion.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.721
You get all the pieces...

10:10.335 --> 10:12.117
perfectly in place,

10:12.905 --> 10:15.319
then you predict exactly...

10:15.908 --> 10:18.875
how they're going to
respond to the pressure.

10:20.546 --> 10:21.844
It works.

10:23.015 --> 10:24.514
Never stood a chance.

10:24.516 --> 10:27.150
99 times out of a 100,
this case goes to trial.

10:27.152 --> 10:28.652
Ugh, I should've been more specific.

10:28.654 --> 10:29.986
No, you were great.

10:29.988 --> 10:31.955
We had solid foundation.

10:31.957 --> 10:33.523
Well, on the bright side,

10:33.525 --> 10:35.625
you stay out of the mob's cross hairs.

10:35.627 --> 10:38.094
And land right into my boss'.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.730
DAs tend to frown on
fumbled-away Mafia cases

10:40.732 --> 10:42.566
during an election year.

10:42.568 --> 10:44.067
I'm not worried.

10:44.069 --> 10:46.189
You're very persuasive.

10:47.539 --> 10:50.573
I could think of at least
one judge who disagrees.

10:51.043 --> 10:54.210
I've appeared in front of
Judge Fowler dozens of times.

10:54.212 --> 10:57.013
Never seen him toss evidence like that.

10:57.015 --> 10:59.516
Or you caught him on a bad day.

10:59.518 --> 11:01.484
You want a lift back to the precinct?

11:01.486 --> 11:03.590
My car's out front.

11:13.332 --> 11:14.965
Going down?

11:22.941 --> 11:24.908
Come on...

11:24.910 --> 11:27.490
You didn't really think
that performance would hold up,

11:27.492 --> 11:29.212
Surely?

11:29.214 --> 11:32.427
Justice can be slow off
the block, but she closes fast.

11:33.885 --> 11:36.469
She can also be tripped up.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.586
All you need are the right friends.

11:42.361 --> 11:44.160
You'll have to introduce me.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.999
Well, if we're making the introductions,

11:47.799 --> 11:52.769
how about the name of whoever
suggested this little frame-up.

11:53.207 --> 11:55.191
I don't recall.

11:58.522 --> 12:01.457
Where do you hide a gun in that suit?

12:07.898 --> 12:09.898
Hang on...

12:09.900 --> 12:11.900
It's starting to come back to me.

12:11.902 --> 12:14.204
I thought it might.

12:15.539 --> 12:17.873
Anonymous tip.

12:22.684 --> 12:24.680
Anonymity...

12:24.682 --> 12:26.982
it brings out the worst in us.

12:26.984 --> 12:28.651
I prefer people to know my name.

12:28.653 --> 12:31.013
That's because you're a narcissist.

12:31.868 --> 12:34.123
The world stops when you fall asleep.

12:34.533 --> 12:37.256
A lot of things can happen
when you go to sleep.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.868
Remember not to park in front
of your building tonight.

12:46.838 --> 12:48.469
There's street cleaning in the morning.

12:50.941 --> 12:52.440
Anonymous tip.

12:56.381 --> 12:58.582
Supervising Judge,
Criminal Division, right?

12:58.584 --> 12:59.717
Yeah,

12:59.719 --> 13:01.719
Judge Fowler. F-O-W-L-E-R.

13:01.721 --> 13:03.687
He's clean, just
a couple of speeding tickets,

13:03.689 --> 13:05.356
and a traffic accident in 2012.

13:05.358 --> 13:06.523
Anyone injured?

13:06.525 --> 13:07.491
Pedestrian broke her leg.

13:07.493 --> 13:08.692
Maria Rojas.

13:08.694 --> 13:10.327
Says here she was
leaving a clothing store

13:10.329 --> 13:11.295
when the accident happened.

13:11.297 --> 13:12.629
Loman.

13:12.631 --> 13:13.964
Customer or employee?

13:13.966 --> 13:15.766
She worked there.
The owners called it in.

13:15.768 --> 13:16.767
I'll text you the address.

13:16.769 --> 13:19.069
- Thanks.
- Yo, Loman.

13:19.071 --> 13:21.238
Is there a responding officer listed?

13:21.240 --> 13:24.541
Yeah, Robert Sadowski,
left the department in 2013...

13:24.543 --> 13:26.343
- What do you want?
- My usual.

13:29.015 --> 13:31.648
Hey, you wanna tell me
why we're looking at a judge?

13:31.650 --> 13:33.150
Because he just let a mobster go

13:33.152 --> 13:35.119
who knows where I live.

13:35.121 --> 13:37.287
And a tuna fish, extra tomatoes.

13:37.289 --> 13:38.255
Harlee?

13:40.259 --> 13:41.592
Yo, that's not my usual.

13:41.594 --> 13:43.761
What do I look like, your girlfriend?

13:44.277 --> 13:46.109
Turkey on what, everything but tomato.

13:46.143 --> 13:47.409
Oh, no tomato, huh?

13:47.411 --> 13:49.077
Too bad. Good source of lycopene.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.212
Prevents heart disease.

13:50.214 --> 13:51.547
- Yeah, I take vitamins.
- As you should.

13:51.549 --> 13:53.842
New York's finest need to
look after their health.

13:54.351 --> 13:55.851
And a Diet Coke, please.

13:55.853 --> 13:57.319
You know I read somewhere
that artificial sweeteners

13:57.321 --> 13:59.261
trigger insulin production.

13:59.857 --> 14:01.156
Look, man, are you trying
to sell me something, or?

14:01.158 --> 14:02.825
- Oh, no.
- No?

14:02.827 --> 14:04.827
In fact, I'd like to buy your lunch.

14:04.829 --> 14:07.129
In appreciation of your service.

14:07.131 --> 14:09.431
We're fine, thanks.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.266
Come on, it's the least
an average Joe like me can do

14:11.268 --> 14:12.568
for the heroes of our city.

14:12.570 --> 14:14.403
You guys have all taken it
on the chin late...

14:14.405 --> 14:16.538
are you staying hydrated, Officer?

14:16.540 --> 14:17.873
Throw in a bottle of water.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.541
Look, I appreciate the gesture,

14:19.543 --> 14:21.176
- but we're not allowed to exch...
- Hey, hey, hey, look, Loman,

14:21.178 --> 14:23.879
you're holding up the line.
Let average Joe buy you lunch.

14:23.881 --> 14:26.181
Matter of fact, Joe, make it two.

14:26.183 --> 14:27.816
My pleasure, gentlemen.

14:27.818 --> 14:28.817
Thanks.

14:28.819 --> 14:30.986
Keep the change.

14:31.374 --> 14:33.121
Oh, I didn't catch your name.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.070
Loman. Michael Loman.

14:35.072 --> 14:36.538
Nice to meet you, Detective Loman.

14:36.540 --> 14:39.541
Tom Verco. Internal Affairs.

14:39.543 --> 14:41.777
Keep up the good work, gentlemen.

14:47.818 --> 14:49.985
Is there anything you'd like
to say to this nice man

14:49.987 --> 14:51.787
who works 12 hours a day

14:51.789 --> 14:53.956
making an honest living?

14:53.958 --> 14:56.425
I tagged your store, I'm sorry. I guess.

14:56.427 --> 14:58.293
And?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.330
You'd like the opportunity
to repaint it.

15:01.332 --> 15:02.497
Yeah, whatever.

15:02.499 --> 15:05.567
I got paint. Come back at 7:00.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.972
Hey, from now on,
you are personally responsible

15:09.974 --> 15:11.940
for that storefront.
If someone spits on it,

15:11.942 --> 15:14.743
you're out there with Windex.
Do you understand?

15:17.715 --> 15:18.880
I thought you were taking it easy.

15:18.882 --> 15:21.823
Uh, it felt okay for a second, I forgot.

15:23.008 --> 15:24.353
How much can I get for this?

15:24.355 --> 15:25.821
On your finger?

15:25.823 --> 15:27.322
All right, we're good.

15:27.324 --> 15:30.625
One seventh grader and
suddenly you're a superhero?

15:30.627 --> 15:33.261
The older kids come in packs.

15:33.602 --> 15:34.802
It's over a carat.

15:34.804 --> 15:35.903
Just needs to be cleaned.

15:35.905 --> 15:37.071
I can't keep an eye on them all,

15:37.073 --> 15:38.706
and I got firearms on display.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.207
All right, I'll put
a blue and white outside

15:40.209 --> 15:41.675
for a couple of days, okay?

15:41.677 --> 15:43.177
For you, sweetheart, $1,200.

15:43.179 --> 15:45.479
Joe paid four times that.

15:45.481 --> 15:47.481
I should know, I put up half.

15:47.483 --> 15:49.649
An empty squad car.
That's your solution?

15:49.674 --> 15:51.273
Well, it's like the ring.

15:51.275 --> 15:52.608
Visual deterrent.

15:52.610 --> 15:55.077
And maybe some increased patrols?

15:55.079 --> 15:57.713
Yes, I hear response time
is gonna get better

15:57.715 --> 15:59.081
in this neighborhood.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.716
Good to know.

16:00.718 --> 16:03.385
No, keep it on ice.

16:03.387 --> 16:05.020
I'll be back next month.

16:05.022 --> 16:06.689
What am I? A bank?

16:06.691 --> 16:08.824
Now that's a racket.

16:08.826 --> 16:10.659
We got a deal?

16:10.661 --> 16:12.127
No...

16:12.129 --> 16:14.296
but we have your back.

16:14.298 --> 16:16.098
I'll make this deposit on your behalf.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.600
What happened to next month?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.268
He's not the accountant.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.236
Tess, let's go.

16:21.499 --> 16:22.999
I was just explaining the concept of

16:23.001 --> 16:24.300
visual deterrents.

16:24.302 --> 16:27.060
Your ass is a visual deterrent.

16:27.772 --> 16:29.906
Can you tell me anything about
the accident four years ago?

16:29.908 --> 16:33.743
I was crossing the street,
and a car jumped a...

16:33.745 --> 16:35.211
la luz roja.

16:35.213 --> 16:37.380
- He ran a red light?
- Yes, and he hit me.

16:37.382 --> 16:39.415
Acting weird, you know...

16:39.417 --> 16:40.416
con sus tragos.

16:40.418 --> 16:42.452
_

16:42.454 --> 16:45.626
_

16:45.694 --> 16:49.338
_

16:49.708 --> 16:51.708
_

16:51.841 --> 16:52.914
_

16:52.934 --> 16:54.934
_

16:55.051 --> 16:56.550
_

16:56.577 --> 16:57.534
_

16:57.561 --> 17:00.740
_

17:02.107 --> 17:04.107
Hurricane Sandy?

17:07.579 --> 17:08.746
Look, I'm just saying, all right?

17:08.748 --> 17:09.881
It's entrapment.

17:09.883 --> 17:10.882
Textbook.

17:10.884 --> 17:12.383
The guy bought us a sandwich.

17:12.385 --> 17:13.851
Which textbook are you
reading that teaches

17:13.853 --> 17:15.588
sandwich entrapment?

17:16.556 --> 17:17.688
You gonna eat that?

17:17.690 --> 17:18.821
Yeah.

17:19.192 --> 17:20.691
I'm destroying the evidence.

17:20.693 --> 17:22.426
Espada, meet Tess at the motor pool.

17:22.429 --> 17:23.928
I need you to drop off a sled.

17:23.930 --> 17:25.730
You sure? 'Cause Loman's
gonna wanna keep me here

17:25.732 --> 17:27.732
on the case of mysterious
sandwich entrapment.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.700
What? Go! She's waiting, come on.

17:29.702 --> 17:31.202
All right.

17:31.204 --> 17:33.171
What's he talking about?

17:33.173 --> 17:34.839
Look, this guy approached us
at the hoagie stand,

17:34.841 --> 17:36.340
insisting on buying me a sandwich.

17:36.342 --> 17:38.309
I tell him no, he throws
his money on the counter,

17:38.311 --> 17:39.811
wants to honor New York's finest...

17:39.813 --> 17:42.780
This riveting story
better have a twist real soon.

17:42.782 --> 17:44.081
He's Internal Affairs.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.583
All right, so, Internal Affairs

17:45.585 --> 17:46.751
bought you a hoagie?

17:46.753 --> 17:48.219
Detective Tom Verco, do you know him?

17:49.889 --> 17:52.023
Don't lose sleep over this.

17:52.512 --> 17:54.178
- Hey.
- None of them

17:54.180 --> 17:55.513
are working, Matt.

17:55.515 --> 17:56.814
And now, I can't get any cash

17:56.816 --> 17:58.816
so the driver thinks that I am a thief,

17:58.818 --> 18:00.484
and is threatening to call the police.

18:00.486 --> 18:01.652
What driver?

18:01.654 --> 18:03.154
The taxi cab driver.

18:03.156 --> 18:04.288
I'm gonna be arrested.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.623
No one's gonna arrest you,

18:05.625 --> 18:07.425
tell them you're on the phone
with the police now.

18:07.427 --> 18:09.260
Yeah, I told him. He doesn't care.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.594
He just wants his money.

18:10.596 --> 18:12.063
Have you tried all the cards?

18:12.065 --> 18:13.230
Yes!

18:13.232 --> 18:14.899
Then maybe it's his system.

18:14.901 --> 18:16.467
Put this guy on the phone.

18:16.469 --> 18:18.636
Matt, I thought of that.
That is why we went to the ATM,

18:18.638 --> 18:19.937
and that's not working either.

18:19.939 --> 18:22.573
Woz, I think this guy is targeting me.

18:22.575 --> 18:23.908
Close the door.

18:23.910 --> 18:25.242
Matt, are you listening to me?

18:25.244 --> 18:26.243
Yeah, yes, yes, sorry.

18:26.245 --> 18:27.878
All right, where are you now?

18:27.880 --> 18:29.046
Sixth and Flatbush.

18:29.048 --> 18:30.848
I'm gonna send Loman with some cash,

18:30.850 --> 18:33.640
then I'm gonna call the credit
card companies, okay?

18:33.665 --> 18:35.465
I did that already, and
then they told me that someone

18:35.467 --> 18:37.112
had put a freeze on our account.

18:37.114 --> 18:38.941
They gave me an 800 number to call.

18:38.966 --> 18:41.771
All right, what's the 800 number?

18:41.773 --> 18:43.773
800, um...

18:43.775 --> 18:46.742
Woz, do you know him?
Detective Tom Verco?

18:46.744 --> 18:47.877
No!

18:47.879 --> 18:49.078
Matt!

18:49.080 --> 18:51.380
Sorry. Sorry, nothing, nothing, nothing.

18:51.382 --> 18:52.882
I got it.

18:52.884 --> 18:55.852
If a patrolman shows up
before Loman gets there,

18:55.854 --> 18:57.585
just give him my name.

18:58.423 --> 19:00.070
All right, sweetie.

19:01.326 --> 19:03.826
I don't know every
Internal Affair officer

19:03.828 --> 19:05.795
in Brooklyn, okay?

19:05.797 --> 19:08.130
Take my car to my wife, pay the fare,

19:08.132 --> 19:09.265
and I'll reimburse you.

19:09.267 --> 19:10.900
Woz, this guy came straight to me.

19:10.902 --> 19:12.568
- You think he knows something?
- I don't know.

19:12.570 --> 19:16.372
Look, one of theirs
up and disappeared...

19:16.374 --> 19:18.274
so it was only a matter
of time before they started

19:18.276 --> 19:19.675
asking questions.

19:19.677 --> 19:21.811
That's the thing,
he didn't ask any questions.

19:21.813 --> 19:23.479
Don't get rattled.

19:23.481 --> 19:25.481
You're giving them
exactly what they want.

19:25.483 --> 19:27.276
Don't do that.

19:30.788 --> 19:32.755
Afternoon, Lieutenant.

19:32.757 --> 19:35.725
Apparently you're having
some financial difficulties?

19:35.727 --> 19:37.727
FBI authority has quite a reach, huh?

19:37.729 --> 19:40.863
I guess you don't have to be
competent to abuse power.

19:40.865 --> 19:42.865
Guess I like pushing buttons, too.

19:43.354 --> 19:44.834
You feeling any more
inclined to cooperate?

19:52.896 --> 19:55.864
24 hour police presence,
delivered free of charge.

19:55.866 --> 19:57.533
Yeah, no kidding.

19:57.535 --> 19:59.702
When do you think Woz is gonna
let us turn the spigot back on?

19:59.704 --> 20:01.370
Collections?

20:01.372 --> 20:02.671
I don't know, I was hoping soon

20:02.673 --> 20:04.840
since we didn't take
any heat from the heist.

20:04.842 --> 20:07.710
But now Internal Affairs
might be bird-dogging us.

20:07.712 --> 20:08.711
You gotta be me.

20:08.713 --> 20:09.712
- IA?
- Don't worry,

20:09.714 --> 20:11.213
this guy's a dial tone.

20:11.215 --> 20:12.881
I gotta stop making decisions.

20:12.883 --> 20:14.710
I'm on a bad streak.

20:16.387 --> 20:19.221
Technically, deciding
not to make decisions...

20:19.223 --> 20:21.223
is making a decision.

20:21.225 --> 20:23.269
Yeah, thanks, Socrates.

20:23.561 --> 20:25.995
Meanwhile, I'm running up
credit card debt,

20:25.997 --> 20:27.563
and I can't pay my bills.

20:27.565 --> 20:30.532
Throw in a white picket fence,
you've got the American dream.

20:30.534 --> 20:32.246
Seriously...

20:33.204 --> 20:34.370
I might be tempted to...

20:34.372 --> 20:36.045
To what?

20:38.376 --> 20:40.709
Pack it all up and
run away with the circus.

20:40.711 --> 20:42.211
You've got a clown phobia.

20:42.213 --> 20:44.313
See? Another bad decision.

20:51.422 --> 20:52.921
What happened to your window?

20:52.923 --> 20:54.590
Your link is broken.

20:54.592 --> 20:55.524
What link?

20:55.526 --> 20:56.759
The link, the video.

20:56.761 --> 20:58.193
Your feed from Stahl's apartment.

20:58.195 --> 21:00.863
It's giving me "Error. No server found."

21:00.865 --> 21:02.865
It's probably expired.
I mean, I sent it to you

21:02.867 --> 21:05.534
the night he picked you up.
Then unexpire it for me.

21:05.775 --> 21:06.941
What do you need it for?

21:06.943 --> 21:08.609
I'm not gonna explain myself!

21:08.611 --> 21:10.342
No, of course you're not.

21:11.114 --> 21:13.114
You know, the past three weeks,
you've had two modes

21:13.116 --> 21:14.719
of expression with me.

21:15.285 --> 21:16.617
Silence and rage.

21:16.619 --> 21:19.437
Okay, all right,
let's express ourselves.

21:19.789 --> 21:21.622
The judge dismissed Bianchi's case.

21:21.624 --> 21:23.958
Yeah, three hours ago, I know.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.294
Now what about your modes of expression?

21:26.296 --> 21:27.795
Omission and lies.

21:27.797 --> 21:29.820
- What about that?
- Want some truth?

21:31.467 --> 21:34.669
Bianchi beat a murder rap
four years ago...

21:34.671 --> 21:37.004
when evidence went missing
during Hurricane Sandy.

21:37.006 --> 21:39.840
I think the judge escaped his DWI

21:39.842 --> 21:41.842
and vehicular assault charge
the same way.

21:41.844 --> 21:44.335
Weren't you the one crying
about a world of hurt?

21:45.181 --> 21:47.591
That was before Bianchi
threatened me today.

21:48.685 --> 21:50.618
He basically said he has
the judge in his pocket.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.620
Just leave him alone.

21:54.958 --> 21:56.123
I'm trying to track down

21:56.125 --> 21:57.825
Judge Fowler's arresting officer.

21:57.827 --> 21:59.827
A retired cop named Sadowski.

21:59.829 --> 22:01.329
If there is corruption in the courts,

22:01.331 --> 22:02.663
then we have a responsibility.

22:02.665 --> 22:05.666
There's corruption everywhere, Harlee.

22:05.668 --> 22:08.669
And I'm not taking another step
for that son of a bitch.

22:08.671 --> 22:09.670
Who?

22:09.672 --> 22:11.672
From your FBI boyfriend!

22:11.674 --> 22:14.342
It starts and it ends with him.

22:14.344 --> 22:15.676
If you wanna handle Stahl, I just...

22:15.678 --> 22:18.379
I know how to handle Stahl.

22:18.381 --> 22:20.715
And I only have 45 minutes.

22:20.717 --> 22:22.049
To do what?

22:22.051 --> 22:24.051
Just give me your link.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.093
Do they get along?

22:32.095 --> 22:33.507
I can't tell.

22:34.263 --> 22:36.975
Mm, we're a passionate bunch.

22:38.267 --> 22:40.451
Angry drawer?

22:41.938 --> 22:43.571
Are you lost or something?

22:43.573 --> 22:45.563
No, but it's a common assumption.

22:47.577 --> 22:49.458
Are you feeling okay?

22:49.912 --> 22:51.412
You know, my brother's a chiropractor.

22:51.414 --> 22:53.586
If I make a call, he could
probably squeeze you in.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.100
And do I pretend that I know you?

22:57.286 --> 22:59.754
Almost every accusation
of neglect by your ex-wife

22:59.756 --> 23:01.756
can be explained by
dedication to your job,

23:01.758 --> 23:03.424
which doesn't usually
garner much sympathy.

23:03.426 --> 23:04.925
But this is the FBI.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.594
Patriotism, service to country...

23:06.596 --> 23:08.763
Exactly, work those words,
service and sacrifice,

23:08.765 --> 23:10.097
into every answer you can.

23:10.099 --> 23:12.178
You think we got a shot
at joint custody here?

23:12.769 --> 23:14.035
What?

23:16.439 --> 23:20.107
- Who's in charge, Harlee?
- You know you are.

23:20.109 --> 23:21.975
Never forget that.

23:22.612 --> 23:24.522
Turn around.

23:26.449 --> 23:28.949
I'm not the only one that got this.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.256
She was a cop...

23:46.769 --> 23:49.175
before you made her a rat.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.581
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

24:06.756 --> 24:08.255
The Palace Hotel.

24:08.257 --> 24:09.924
Yep, yep, no, that's
very helpful, thank you.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.592
Yes, I won't forget who told me.

24:11.594 --> 24:12.952
I promise.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.763
Your phone kept ringing and ringing.

24:15.765 --> 24:17.765
It's a PR guy from Veritas Security.

24:17.767 --> 24:19.934
He seemed very excited to call you back.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.268
I may have flirted a little.

24:21.270 --> 24:22.269
Yeah, I got that impression,

24:22.271 --> 24:23.604
so I did one of you.

24:23.606 --> 24:25.639
Your retired Officer Sadowski

24:25.641 --> 24:27.641
works their personal security service.

24:27.643 --> 24:29.643
He's on a detail,
assigned to the Palace Hotel

24:29.645 --> 24:31.112
for the next hour and a half.

24:31.114 --> 24:32.520
Swanky.

24:33.616 --> 24:36.450
Hey, do you mind if I ride along?

24:36.452 --> 24:37.785
It's nothing exciting,
I'm just chasing down

24:37.787 --> 24:38.953
a missing report.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.711
Well, it beats staring at a desk.

24:41.624 --> 24:42.790
You okay?

24:42.792 --> 24:45.135
Nothing a fancy hotel can't fix...

25:30.531 --> 25:32.364
I'm a man of no debt.

25:32.366 --> 25:34.567
And neither is my crew.

25:35.636 --> 25:37.803
"Owe no man anything,
but to love one another,

25:37.805 --> 25:40.105
for he that loves one another
has fulfilled the law."

25:41.742 --> 25:43.876
Big Bible fan, are you?

25:43.878 --> 25:45.377
Especially when a man
puts his hand on it,

25:45.379 --> 25:46.512
and swears to tell the truth.

25:46.514 --> 25:48.981
Yeah, how about the part that says...

25:49.393 --> 25:51.426
"Don't covet thy neighbor's desk."

25:51.428 --> 25:53.395
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

25:53.397 --> 25:54.696
It was empty.

25:54.698 --> 25:57.065
So is the holding cell.

25:57.067 --> 25:59.201
You know, some weeks ago,
you violently pulled

25:59.203 --> 26:01.336
one of my associates,
Detective Donald Pomp,

26:01.338 --> 26:03.255
out of a deposition.

26:03.974 --> 26:05.926
Is there a question?

26:06.443 --> 26:08.577
He's been missing for over three weeks.

26:08.579 --> 26:11.046
I might've lost my temper a little.

26:11.048 --> 26:13.348
He openly questioned
some of my more effective

26:13.350 --> 26:15.984
policing techniques without
allowing me the opportunity

26:15.986 --> 26:17.786
to defend my actions.

26:17.788 --> 26:19.254
Hm.

26:19.727 --> 26:20.755
Were they defensible?

26:20.757 --> 26:22.557
Absolutely.

26:22.918 --> 26:24.526
From what I can determine,
old Donnie spent a lot of time

26:24.528 --> 26:26.528
- around here.
- Yeah...

26:27.002 --> 26:28.997
I don't wanna insult
your policing technique,

26:28.999 --> 26:31.299
but there aren't a lot
of places for a man to hide

26:31.301 --> 26:32.934
in this building.

26:32.936 --> 26:35.321
Well, you know,
I'm an explorer by nature,

26:35.323 --> 26:36.415
and...

26:36.417 --> 26:37.906
beyond Detective Pomp's disappearance,

26:37.908 --> 26:40.548
I believe there are
some fascinating frontiers

26:40.609 --> 26:42.443
yet to be discovered in this precinct.

26:42.445 --> 26:43.410
- Do you?
- Yeah.

26:43.412 --> 26:45.412
It's rough terrain.

26:45.414 --> 26:47.381
Be careful you don't lose your way.

26:47.383 --> 26:48.849
I think you're right;
I may have to procure

26:48.851 --> 26:50.184
an experienced guide.

26:50.186 --> 26:51.485
Perhaps somebody from your crew?

26:51.487 --> 26:53.428
Good luck with that.

26:54.457 --> 26:56.490
They're a loyal bunch.

26:59.695 --> 27:01.528
This Officer Sadowski?

27:01.530 --> 27:03.163
I volunteer to grill him mercilessly.

27:03.165 --> 27:04.498
What's our interest, exactly?

27:04.500 --> 27:05.466
Say you're a patrolman.

27:05.468 --> 27:06.967
You show up at a car accident,

27:06.969 --> 27:09.103
there's one victim and the
driver at fault is belligerent

27:09.105 --> 27:10.571
and slurring. First, you...

27:10.573 --> 27:12.206
Cuff him harder than usual,
then send the scumbag

27:12.208 --> 27:13.507
to the hospital for a blood test.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.009
Right, which should
yield a lab report...

27:15.011 --> 27:17.210
- Every time.
- Except one.

27:17.235 --> 27:18.701
Sadowski let Judge Fowler go.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.703
Now he's gonna tell me why.

27:20.705 --> 27:21.837
You can't park there, valet only.

27:21.839 --> 27:23.321
Make an exception.

27:23.674 --> 27:25.708
Wanna tell me what's eating you?

27:27.612 --> 27:30.026
I don't know,
I might've made a bad call.

27:30.581 --> 27:32.047
On the job or personal?

27:32.049 --> 27:33.382
Both.

27:33.384 --> 27:34.683
I took an envelope.

27:34.685 --> 27:36.185
A couple of 100 bucks.

27:36.187 --> 27:38.320
Two month's protection
from Gaines Pawn Shop.

27:38.322 --> 27:39.955
Woz asked him to hold it for us.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.791
Tess, we stopped
collections for a reason.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.092
You don't think I know that?

27:43.094 --> 27:45.060
I don't even remember
making the decision.

27:45.062 --> 27:46.395
I'm gonna hand it back to the owner,

27:46.397 --> 27:47.863
I just gotta come up with
a good cover story.

27:47.865 --> 27:50.032
No, you need to come clean.

27:50.034 --> 27:52.334
Uh, I've already been
shot once this year.

27:52.336 --> 27:54.136
Woz will understand.

27:54.561 --> 27:55.971
Money's tight right now,
we're all feeling it,

27:55.973 --> 27:58.336
but if he thinks you went
outside his trust...

27:58.361 --> 28:00.041
Early retirement.

28:01.030 --> 28:02.162
Tell him.

28:02.164 --> 28:03.497
Trust me.

28:03.499 --> 28:05.528
I know from experience.

28:07.570 --> 28:09.481
Can we just find your guy?

28:10.039 --> 28:12.339
Ask the front desk for
a list of private events.

28:12.341 --> 28:13.841
All right.

28:50.546 --> 28:52.179
Harlee?

28:52.181 --> 28:54.014
Hey.

28:54.516 --> 28:55.549
What are you doing here?

28:55.551 --> 28:57.361
I was looking for you.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.053
You got a minute, or
do I need to buy a table?

29:00.055 --> 29:03.023
Um, individual donations
are always welcome.

29:05.129 --> 29:06.460
Um, it's about Woz.

29:06.462 --> 29:07.794
You know, he's...

29:07.796 --> 29:09.763
He's been under a lot of heat lately...

29:09.765 --> 29:12.566
so, you know, I just thought
I should let you know.

29:12.568 --> 29:14.534
You know, for his protection...

29:14.536 --> 29:16.036
and yours.

29:16.038 --> 29:17.504
He sent you?

29:17.506 --> 29:19.473
Well, he wouldn't exactly
fit in a place like this,

29:19.475 --> 29:21.169
would he?

29:21.811 --> 29:23.777
Yeah, he just thinks that
he should keep his distance.

29:23.779 --> 29:25.412
You know?

29:25.985 --> 29:28.415
That's why he refused your favor.

29:29.155 --> 29:31.521
Favors are like handshakes,

29:31.715 --> 29:34.305
it's hard to keep track of them all.

29:35.952 --> 29:38.420
I was in court today.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.294
Glad that went your way.

29:42.772 --> 29:44.405
It's good to see you, Harlee.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.407
I gotta get back to the grip and grin,

29:46.409 --> 29:48.807
but grab some food on your way out.

29:54.951 --> 29:56.751
Huh?

29:56.753 --> 29:58.553
Yeah, you got nothing to worry about.

29:58.555 --> 30:00.822
Yeah, I'm aware it's a hurricane,

30:00.824 --> 30:02.023
but you don't have to evacuate.

30:02.025 --> 30:03.324
You're five miles from the flood zone.

30:03.326 --> 30:05.326
Ma? Ma?

30:05.328 --> 30:07.295
Well, look who's all cozy and warm.

30:07.297 --> 30:09.130
Captains, good to see you.

30:09.132 --> 30:11.099
64th hasn't been the same without you.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.600
Yeah, fewer dirty jokes?

30:12.602 --> 30:13.601
By half.

30:14.905 --> 30:16.704
Aren't you guys
supposed to be out on patrol?

30:16.706 --> 30:18.373
I'm taking off,
emergency vehicles are all

30:18.375 --> 30:20.008
prepped and placed for evacuations.

30:20.010 --> 30:23.311
Uh, a shelter at a church
on 14th just got overrun.

30:23.313 --> 30:24.946
May need assistance.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.582
We just got here, like,
soaking wet just got here.

30:27.584 --> 30:29.584
Why waste a good towel?

30:29.586 --> 30:30.885
- Woz?
- Don't look at me.

30:30.887 --> 30:32.520
She outranks us all now.

30:32.522 --> 30:33.855
Yeah, I think I liked her better

30:33.857 --> 30:35.156
when she was just one of us.

30:35.158 --> 30:37.158
All right, Sap. I'll tell you what.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.960
If I'm still here when you get back,

30:38.962 --> 30:40.762
drinks are on me.

30:41.330 --> 30:43.731
We're gonna hold you to that, Captain.

30:44.347 --> 30:45.400
Okay.

30:45.827 --> 30:47.927
Now we got a good reason to leave.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.562
How're we doing, Woz?

30:49.564 --> 30:51.254
All right.

30:52.567 --> 30:54.200
How's he doing?

30:54.590 --> 30:56.702
It's the anniversary
of his daughter's death.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.491
Not the day to look
for justice in the world.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.057
Excuse me.

31:01.059 --> 31:03.025
All this footage of rushing water...

31:07.065 --> 31:09.166
You know, you're not
fooling anybody, Woz.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.834
Lots of little glasses make a bottle.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.366
Huh.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.977
You know, the last six years,

31:17.609 --> 31:20.116
every October 28th...

31:21.791 --> 31:23.911
it's been nothing but sun.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.238
And now...

31:28.820 --> 31:31.120
now, I think, God's got the idea.

31:33.424 --> 31:35.925
We've got flooding
in four precincts now.

31:36.383 --> 31:38.394
They need some leadership,
and I've just run out of excuses

31:38.396 --> 31:39.729
why it shouldn't be me.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.131
So I'm putting you on Woz duty.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.766
Make sure he gets home safe, okay?

31:43.768 --> 31:45.801
- You bet.
- Thanks.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.030
All right.

31:50.005 --> 31:51.674
You do what she says, okay?

31:51.676 --> 31:54.644
Keep your powder dry.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.012
Will do.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.961
You know, I-I...
I don't need a babysitter.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.547
You could just go home.

32:04.549 --> 32:06.516
I'm doing just fine without you today.

32:06.518 --> 32:08.484
Uh-huh? And with that last trick,

32:08.486 --> 32:10.453
ladies and gentlemen,

32:10.455 --> 32:13.089
we end our entertainment
for this evening.

32:13.091 --> 32:14.591
Last call.

32:15.727 --> 32:19.395
Uh, I need to cut back
on our bar nights.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.030
Cristina just took up the cello,

32:21.032 --> 32:23.032
and a good one's gonna
set me back a grand.

32:23.034 --> 32:25.327
You know, Cristina's...

32:25.970 --> 32:27.970
she's a bright light.

32:27.972 --> 32:30.940
You'd move heaven and earth
for that girl.

32:30.942 --> 32:33.701
And hell, too, if she asked.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.250
You know what?

32:38.116 --> 32:39.469
What?

32:40.239 --> 32:41.918
I'd do the same for you.

33:01.257 --> 33:03.090
Good, you're still here,
I need to talk to you.

33:03.092 --> 33:04.392
- No.
- Look, the mob doesn't

33:04.394 --> 33:05.893
own the judge, Julia does.

33:05.895 --> 33:07.361
She made his DWI go away.

33:07.363 --> 33:08.863
Took care of the arresting officer.

33:08.865 --> 33:09.997
Sadowksi... gave him a cushy job.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.332
Tess, I need a ride home.

33:11.334 --> 33:12.466
Harlee's car is right here.

33:12.468 --> 33:13.968
I didn't ask Harlee.

33:13.970 --> 33:15.436
He'll be right there.

33:15.438 --> 33:16.771
Look, when you didn't
help her with Bianchi,

33:16.773 --> 33:18.239
she went to the judge.

33:18.241 --> 33:20.041
She's trading favors, Woz.

33:20.043 --> 33:23.010
Using evidence she stole
during Hurricane Sandy.

33:23.012 --> 33:25.479
All right, good to know.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.814
Come on!

33:26.816 --> 33:28.582
Leave it alone, Harlee.

33:41.961 --> 33:43.627
Hey, are you really hocking your ring,

33:43.629 --> 33:45.993
or was that just general grumbling?

33:46.765 --> 33:50.567
You know, they make
diamonds in labs now.

33:50.569 --> 33:52.456
Real diamonds.

33:53.506 --> 33:56.773
Suddenly, the one you have
doesn't feel so special.

33:56.775 --> 33:59.243
Linda and I have hit
potholes along the way;

33:59.245 --> 34:02.045
you just have to keep on swinging.

34:02.047 --> 34:04.014
Two words, Woz.

34:04.016 --> 34:08.018
Irreconcilable differences.

34:16.004 --> 34:17.971
A few weeks ago,
I was reading bedtime stories

34:17.973 --> 34:19.973
and excepting windfall.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.574
Now I haven't seen my kids in two days;

34:21.576 --> 34:24.043
I'm running protection for
free, and then, oh, oh, yeah,

34:24.045 --> 34:25.678
somewhere in the middle
of there, I got shot.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.514
I know the weather's been rough lately,

34:28.516 --> 34:30.315
but we'll ride it out.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.541
I promise.

34:33.621 --> 34:35.088
Woz, Woz, wait.

34:35.090 --> 34:37.389
I gotta tell you something.

34:37.391 --> 34:39.391
It's stupid, it's no big deal.

34:39.393 --> 34:41.027
I don't even know why I did it.

34:41.029 --> 34:45.130
This wouldn't happen to be
about the pawn shop, would it?

34:45.132 --> 34:46.766
You saw me take the envelope?

34:46.768 --> 34:49.702
Don't sugarcoat it with
soft words like "take."

34:49.704 --> 34:54.007
You stole that money against my orders.

34:54.453 --> 34:56.636
We share everything.

34:59.163 --> 35:00.796
Why didn't you say something?

35:00.798 --> 35:02.097
I was...

35:02.099 --> 35:04.774
waiting to see how long
you'd live with it.

35:05.236 --> 35:06.869
I was hoping for three minutes.

35:06.871 --> 35:09.182
I'll take six hours.

35:09.874 --> 35:11.206
I'm sorry, Woz.

35:11.208 --> 35:12.675
Just take the money.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.253
Enjoy it.

35:14.645 --> 35:17.399
But it is a big deal.

35:18.082 --> 35:20.694
Loyalty is everything.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.518
Especially now.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.487
We have to stick together.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.879
Hey, Linda?

35:44.576 --> 35:47.102
Linda, what's with the mood lighting?

35:48.559 --> 35:50.979
Did Con Ed flag us, too?

35:53.799 --> 35:55.384
Ah, no.

35:55.984 --> 35:57.686
Linda?

35:58.298 --> 35:59.354
Hey...

35:59.967 --> 36:02.108
I'm sorry about earlier.

36:02.110 --> 36:05.594
Those credit card companies
are a pain in the ass.

36:06.551 --> 36:09.118
I did get an apology from
the bastards, so...

36:09.120 --> 36:11.087
we can consider that a...

36:11.089 --> 36:13.328
a minor victory.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.046
How you doing?

36:16.528 --> 36:18.494
Hey... wha...

36:18.496 --> 36:19.829
What? I told you I'll take care of it,

36:19.831 --> 36:21.634
I'm gonna take care of it.

36:23.370 --> 36:26.135
Was Donnie the first one?

36:30.315 --> 36:31.754
What?

36:33.203 --> 36:34.644
Donnie who?

36:34.646 --> 36:36.019
Matt...

36:38.131 --> 36:40.583
L-Linda, I can't fix what's wrong

36:40.585 --> 36:42.885
unless you tell me what's going on.

36:44.189 --> 36:45.488
I would never risk what we have,

36:45.490 --> 36:46.656
not for anything, and you know that.

36:46.658 --> 36:48.624
You know how I feel about you.

36:48.626 --> 36:50.259
Come on, almost a year now
we've been together,

36:50.261 --> 36:53.062
hiding in hotel rooms,
hiding our feelings.

36:53.064 --> 36:55.998
I wanna be with you, Matt...

37:01.268 --> 37:03.201
I don't like being lied to.

37:03.203 --> 37:05.504
Okay, I got it.

37:05.506 --> 37:06.838
Do you?

37:06.840 --> 37:08.807
Yeah...

37:23.674 --> 37:25.257
Oh, my God.

37:37.183 --> 37:38.935
Cristina?

37:47.429 --> 37:48.896
Cristina?

37:48.898 --> 37:50.898
Is that you?

37:54.566 --> 37:56.737
We all have secrets, Harlee.

37:56.739 --> 37:58.174
I also have a phone.

37:58.199 --> 38:00.333
Yeah, and no home security.

38:00.668 --> 38:02.167
That's my home security.

38:02.169 --> 38:03.335
Anybody tries to break in...

38:03.337 --> 38:04.470
He doesn't walk out?

38:04.472 --> 38:06.189
Yeah, I'll bet.

38:07.108 --> 38:08.407
What do you think?

38:08.409 --> 38:10.533
You think you can get to that
before I draw mine?

38:12.046 --> 38:15.013
Holster's still strapped,
that's not good.

38:19.453 --> 38:22.421
Look, I have something
for you on Julia Ayres.

38:22.423 --> 38:23.889
The judge who released Bianchi...

38:23.891 --> 38:25.858
You had something
for Wozniak, too, though,

38:25.860 --> 38:27.826
didn't you, Harlee?

38:27.828 --> 38:29.828
Playing both sides is over.

38:29.830 --> 38:31.303
Then stop putting me in the middle.

38:34.268 --> 38:35.234
I...

38:37.415 --> 38:39.104
I found your camera.

38:41.584 --> 38:43.649
I know you're resourceful, Harlee.

38:43.651 --> 38:45.811
You don't profile as a voyeur.

38:45.813 --> 38:47.735
- You do.
- Yeah.

38:47.737 --> 38:49.882
You thought I was spying on you?

38:50.405 --> 38:52.476
- Invading your space?
- Weren't you?

38:52.478 --> 38:55.334
If you thought
I was watching you before,

38:55.336 --> 38:57.790
you're not gonna believe
how close I'm gonna get now.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.983
Do you have any idea
what you cost me today?

39:02.579 --> 39:04.863
Now you have a problem...

39:05.527 --> 39:07.666
because I've lost my best reason...

39:08.158 --> 39:09.802
to behave.

39:10.855 --> 39:11.743
No more secrets.

39:12.236 --> 39:14.712
No more boundaries.

39:17.437 --> 39:19.784
You called her by my name.

39:20.337 --> 39:21.970
What profile does that fit?

39:21.972 --> 39:23.505
How many times did you watch?

39:23.507 --> 39:25.474
Afraid to turn that
analytical mind against itself?

39:25.476 --> 39:27.442
Why would you put a camera
in the bedroom, Harlee.

39:27.444 --> 39:29.277
You're obviously gonna get
more actionable intel...

39:29.279 --> 39:30.278
- 'Cause there's always...
- Out of the living room.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.613
A weakness, a defect.

39:31.615 --> 39:32.747
If you were looking for leverage...

39:32.749 --> 39:34.793
I was looking for control!

39:36.220 --> 39:38.367
That's the spirit.

39:42.793 --> 39:45.727
What did you uncover, Detective?

39:49.564 --> 39:51.800
You know, you're the profiler.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.769
What's your expert opinion
based on the evidence?

40:02.297 --> 40:04.057
Obsession.

40:09.110 --> 40:11.164
You've changed the game, Harlee.

40:12.431 --> 40:14.723
Nothing is off limits now.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.195
Harlee, you know what my problem

40:25.197 --> 40:27.164
with her imitation of you is?

40:27.166 --> 40:29.241
Cuts into your bank account?

40:30.136 --> 40:32.016
She gives it up too easy.

40:54.193 --> 40:56.760
Spending time with your rat?

40:56.762 --> 40:59.063
Ah!

41:18.951 --> 41:22.753
When I find you in hell,
I'm gonna do this again.

41:27.777 --> 41:29.489
Woz, let go.

41:30.079 --> 41:31.913
- Let him go!
- Who's side are you on?

41:31.915 --> 41:33.513
I'm on your side!

41:34.184 --> 41:37.118
You kill him, the world
comes crashing down on us all.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.319
Go inside!

41:38.321 --> 41:39.770
Please...

41:43.092 --> 41:45.474
Cristina's inside.

41:53.636 --> 41:56.003
It's too late, Harlee.

41:58.575 --> 42:01.609
The world's already crashing down.
