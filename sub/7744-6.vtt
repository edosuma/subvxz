WEBVTT

00:08.884 --> 00:10.551
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.636 --> 00:12.136
l'm dropping a morale bomb
on the troops today.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.971
Uniform scrubs on the nurses.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.390
Dress code.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.766
Behold!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.852
The new All Saints duds.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.813
"Wanted, roommate."

00:22.147 --> 00:24.315
Gonna hang these up,
see if l can find somebody

00:24.400 --> 00:27.402
to go splitsies with me on a phat pad.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.195
lf you need a place, Zoey,
l have a place.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.239
-l have a couch.
-Live with you?

00:31.323 --> 00:33.241
Till you find a place, yeah, sure.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.159
l have a present.

00:35.494 --> 00:38.079
-He's not even born yet.
-l know.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.082
But when am l ever gonna have
another baby in my life?

00:41.583 --> 00:43.042
How many did she take?

00:43.127 --> 00:44.460
She took a lot.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.547
-Are you Jackie Peyton?
-Yes.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.631
You've been served.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.724
l thought we weren't
gonna do that anymore.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.200
Oh, fuck.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.037
l just dreamed l used.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.086
Wow. Did you hear what l said?

02:52.089 --> 02:54.257
l heard what you said, Jackie.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.176
And it wasn't a dream.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.973
You stood right there and you took a pill

03:02.057 --> 03:03.975
and made a fool of yourself with your boss

03:04.059 --> 03:06.644
and then came over here and slept it off.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.770
We all saw.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.438
Wait, l just woke up this second, just now.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.232
Oh, don't even try.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.318
We're done, Jackie.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.070
Wait a second.

03:16.864 --> 03:17.905
We're done.

03:36.383 --> 03:56.485
Zoey.

03:57.404 --> 04:01.282
lt took me three hours
to turn off the alarm on your phone.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.786
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

04:05.871 --> 04:09.457
lt's a special app designed
to wake me up in stages.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.543
Phones are phones. Clocks are clocks.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.836
And that is a kimono.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.379
l thought we talked about this, Zoey.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.548
My kitchen is a no-kimono zone.

04:17.633 --> 04:18.633
l thought you were kidding.

04:18.717 --> 04:19.842
l thought l was kidding, too, but that...

04:19.927 --> 04:21.636
lt's a lot. lt is.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.263
l am re-teaching my body to wake up.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.265
With a kimono?

04:26.350 --> 04:28.809
No, with an app. l haven't figured it out yet.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.811
l can probably figure it out.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.189
That's a good thing, Grace,
'cause otherwise me and Fi

04:33.273 --> 04:36.317
are going to give her phone some
swimming lessons in the toilet.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.319
Right, Fi?

04:39.655 --> 04:41.572
l'm doing a thing on snakes.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.823
Zoey helped me nail it.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.117
Ectothermic, rectilinear...

04:45.202 --> 04:47.244
You know, the yoozh.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.622
See? lt's a lot.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.920
-Thanks, Zoey.
-Thanks, Zoey.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.881
Have a good day, guys.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.050
Wait, hold on. Here.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.096
Thank you.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.100
-Show her.
-Come on, Fiona.

05:09.184 --> 05:13.437
Show me what?

05:14.356 --> 05:15.815
Lenny proposed.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.025
Wow. Go, Lenny.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.861
Right? Right?

05:21.697 --> 05:24.281
Congratulations.
Are you gonna wear it to work?

05:24.366 --> 05:25.866
l don't know. Should l not?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.994
lt's up to you. Mine always got in the way.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.455
Playa, hear ya loud and clear-ya.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.541
Wow, Zoey.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.667
With the gloves, l meant.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.377
lt always got in the way with the gloves.

05:36.586 --> 05:41.340
l feel really bad that l'm getting married
when you're getting unmarried.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.010
Honey, no.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.804
Please don't feel bad. lt's very exciting.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.684
Honey.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.981
Prenatal vitamins and black coffee.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.858
Pregnant goddess tea.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.446
l'm toning my uterus.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.364
So am l.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.616
Also l had spinach for brekky,
but that's between us.

06:07.743 --> 06:10.327
l don't want people to think
l'm spoiling my baby.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.746
By eating right?

06:11.997 --> 06:13.706
By sacrificing the things l love.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.541
Meat, seafood, scotch, sex.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.920
Although, it's 9:00 a.m.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.381
l suppose l might not have had sex just yet.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.468
But you might have had oysters and scotch.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.512
-l might have. You don't know.
-Fair enough.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.599
l, however, did have sex for breakfast.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.935
Not really. lt was dream sex.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.104
Felt pretty real, though.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.356
Got loaded and had sex with Cruz.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.529
-You look refreshed.
-Yeah.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.865
Then l woke up and Zoey
was wearing a kimono

06:47.949 --> 06:49.366
and Fi was talking about snakes.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.327
Oh, God, please don't.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.537
That's what it's like to be me.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.372
God, wouldn't it be hilarious

06:55.457 --> 06:57.875
if after all this time
you actually had a thing for doctors?

06:57.959 --> 06:59.502
No, l don't have a thing for doctors.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.628
l have a thing for drugs.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.966
-Yes?
-ls this Jackie Peyton?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.051
Yes, it is.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.727
-HeIIo?
-Yeah, okay.

07:16.812 --> 07:17.853
Thank you.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.982
Everything okay?

07:26.488 --> 07:29.532
That was Kevin's lawyer.
He is suing for custody.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.417
Big wedding? Small wedding?

07:40.502 --> 07:41.752
We haven't talked about it.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.587
How could you not be talking about it?
Who does that?

07:43.672 --> 07:44.964
-lt's a wedding.
-Hey, Jackie.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.846
Jackie?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.265
Okay.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.724
l'm sorry. Hey.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.688
Did you lose something?

08:01.731 --> 08:02.773
No.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.693
Come with me.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.909
So, are you in
the witness protection program?

08:13.994 --> 08:14.994
Excuse me?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.872
Well, l'm going through all the departments,
not just yours,

08:17.956 --> 08:21.417
and in 20 years of being a nurse,
there's not a single complaint against you.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.963
l mean, nothing.
There's no workman's comp, no urinalysis,

08:26.047 --> 08:28.132
no vacation days accrued or used.
l mean, nothing.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.093
Well, Coop alone has lodged
over a dozen complaints,

08:31.178 --> 08:33.220
so you've got to check your computer.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.597
l did. That's what l'm telling you.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.224
There's date of birth, date of hire, that's it.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.810
l peed in a cup like everybody else.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.021
l cashed in my vacation days.
l've got none left.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.064
So, l don't know, just start a new file.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.691
There's no need to call in the guard.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.068
ls that what l did, called in the guard?

08:48.403 --> 08:49.486
Feels like it.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.532
Yeah, Cruz.

08:53.742 --> 08:54.742
Okay, got it.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.536
A hospital transfer, crushed foot.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.080
Come on, walk with me.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.918
lt's a mistake.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.920
One of your lT guys must have
screwed up or something.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.006
The law of averages.
Possible? Yes. Probable? No.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.507
You're making a mountain.
That's all l'm saying.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.885
-Don't underestimate me, Jackie.
-Right back at you.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.346
-How's that?
-Don't underestimate me either.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.639
Don't worry. l won't.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.599
Hey, guys. A male named Carlos.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.392
The ring looks good, boo.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.978
l'm wearing gloves.
OR's ready when you are.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.147
lt still looks good.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.608
-Gettin' hitched.
-Yes, l heard. What do we got?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.027
You are stabilizing him for an amputation.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.528
-Says who?
-Brooklyn Med.

09:31.613 --> 09:36.075
A forklift dropped a safe on his foot.
Nine hundred pounds of steel, bam!

09:37.118 --> 09:40.120
He had a lumbar epidural block,
morphine lV, 1 0 milligrams at Brooklyn Med.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.664
Seriously, he's out of it.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.415
Later, boo.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.793
Hi. My name is Jackie. Can you hear me?

09:46.628 --> 09:47.753
Do you know where you are?

09:52.842 --> 09:55.010
Zoey, call down to OR, tell them to hold off.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.679
-l want to get film from every angle.
-Got it.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.599
-Are you gonna try to save the foot?
-Wouldn't you?

10:01.810 --> 10:03.602
Zoey, would you grab me a Doppler, please?

10:04.479 --> 10:06.313
Let's see if there's any life left in there.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.190
l already did. The ankle's got a pulse.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.734
Are you shitting me? Really?
Okay, game change.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.695
-Do you want to hear?
-No, l'll take your word for it.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.197
Zoey, call down to ortho
and get them in the loop.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.324
Hold on, how did you know
l was gonna ask for a Doppler?

10:17.409 --> 10:18.617
l don't know. Just a hunch.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.912
-You want me to cancel the OR?
-Please. Poor fuckers.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.664
All scrubbed up and itching to saw.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.583
When you're a hammer,

10:26.668 --> 10:28.585
everything looks like a nail.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.254
You can go back out on the floor.
Jackie and l got it.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.674
-Morphine?
-Yeah, give him five.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.097
lf you get home first,
l have stuff in the washer.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.392
And we're out of vacuum bags.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.560
And fish food.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.228
Thank you, Zoey.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.106
She's staying with me
until she can get her own place.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.942
That's the second time you have
an answer that l'm looking for

10:52.027 --> 10:53.694
before l even know what the question is.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.195
That's two for two.
You want to go for three?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.948
Come on, what do l want to know next?

10:58.033 --> 11:00.200
No, l never studied Spanish.
l learned it on the job.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.078
Okay, that's weird.
Maybe l did underestimate you.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.289
Yeah, me, too. You.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.625
All right. Go ahead. l'll keep him company.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.923
How's my guy?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.759
Don't you dare.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.428
Any good patients?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.139
Potential night nurses,
not that it's any of your business.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.475
lf l wasn't a doctor, l'm telling you,
a night nurse all the way.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.518
Well, then thank God you're a doctor.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.482
He kicked.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.901
He knows my voice. He likes me already.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.362
l'm here for you, little buddy.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.906
-Stop it.
-How are you doing? lt's Uncle Coop.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.240
Maybe he's British.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.034
How are you? lt's Uncle Coop.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.495
Oh, my God, you're a donkey.
Please stand up.

11:44.579 --> 11:45.746
Don't!

11:46.206 --> 11:49.500
You're not his uncle.
You're not related to him in any way.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.795
Not biologically, but l'll be there for him
if he needs me, if you need me.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.964
Steer clear of my bloodline.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.969
l'm not afraid of diapers.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.851
You have to call me back, Kevin.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.686
l don't want to go through lawyers.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.730
Please can we be adults?

12:15.443 --> 12:16.443
What?

12:16.528 --> 12:19.071
There is a girl or a guy in 3.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.532
Okay, you have to clarify.
ls it a guy or a girl?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.700
l am currently unable to clarify.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.536
Oh, for God's sake.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.420
Hello, gorgeous.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.255
Are you talking to me?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.006
Hell, yes, l'm talking to you.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.550
Look how pretty your eyes are.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.303
Hello, hello. You must be Lonna.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.472
Excuse me while l bow in thanks,

12:45.557 --> 12:47.057
because, yes, l must be Lonna.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.350
lt's a pretty name.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.352
She's, like, my favorite all-time nurse.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.813
l was afraid l'd get some
ugly-ass doctors, but you two,

12:53.189 --> 12:54.857
swinging it like a big fat purse.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.483
Well, this must be your lucky day.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.404
Apart from the recurrent fever,
sweats and syncope.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.406
Every once in a while, l get hot,

13:02.490 --> 13:04.491
l start to faint and everyone starts to panic.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.369
Also says here you've got
abdominal cramping. ls that accurate?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.163
On the DL, l do a little estrogen.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.458
lt's only now my stomach says
"hell to the no" to the pill.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.542
You know what l'm saying?

13:14.669 --> 13:17.337
Hear that, Jacks? "Hell to the no" to the pill.

13:18.590 --> 13:19.798
Really?

13:20.675 --> 13:21.758
May l?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.844
Let's see what we've got.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.514
Are those your real lashes?

13:27.849 --> 13:28.974
Why, yes, they are.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.101
What part of England are you from?

13:31.186 --> 13:32.686
London, mostly.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.855
You're really tender,
especially around the liver.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.356
Did you know Princess Di?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.108
Briefly. Really lovely.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.485
Oh, my God, l knew it.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.361
Jacks, could we get some blood, please?

13:42.697 --> 13:44.406
Here, this might pinch a little bit.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.617
l did five years of injections.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.784
l don't feel a thing.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.633
Blood.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.843
Urine. Always the urine.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.805
Dr. O'Hara filled me in about
your custody situation, Jackie.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.807
Yeah, welcome to the shit show.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.434
lf you need to slip out for an AA meeting,

14:12.519 --> 14:13.769
l'll cover your shift. Anything you need...

14:13.853 --> 14:15.729
What l'd love is to not talk about it.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.606
Okay.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.234
Hey, what do you know about my file?

14:20.777 --> 14:21.818
What file is that?

14:22.445 --> 14:24.780
Complaints, vacation days, urinalysis.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.698
Don't know anything about it.

14:26.783 --> 14:30.410
-You were the only one...
-What l'd love is to not talk about it.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.212
Lonna, darling,

14:40.296 --> 14:42.506
do you find yourself
sweating more than usual?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.258
You're, like, model-tall.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.968
l bet you rock an outfit like the runway.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.762
Once upon a time, perhaps.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.474
Listen, Lonna,
l'm a little concerned about the estrogen.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.851
Will you tell her
l'm about to get all Sally Field,

14:54.936 --> 14:56.395
Not Without My Daughter on her ass?

14:56.521 --> 14:58.230
'Cause l'm not giving it up.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.023
l see a baby,

15:00.108 --> 15:01.733
but l don't see a ring. You married?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.735
Far from it.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.237
One last question. Blood in your stool?

15:05.363 --> 15:07.823
Okay, back me up.
My questions are way better than hers.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.783
-Don't you think?
-Yes, l do.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.202
Look, could you... Stop ganging up on me.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.121
Lonna, l'd like to admit you

15:14.205 --> 15:16.331
until we hear from radiology
and the lab, all right?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.792
l've got a real job with real insurance,

15:19.127 --> 15:20.627
Xerox and a cubicle.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.713
l can pay for my own stuff, y'all,

15:23.631 --> 15:24.756
so do your thing.

15:25.216 --> 15:29.720
l mean, l wish l could explain
how satisfying it is to be a mother.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.639
-You're not their mother.
-Doesn't mean l don't do mom things.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.766
l do breakfast.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.602
Do you make Jackie breakfast?

15:36.686 --> 15:39.479
l do. And she's not picky.

15:39.564 --> 15:42.107
Neither is Fi, which is good, because Grace,

15:42.191 --> 15:43.775
there's no telling what'll set her off.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.070
Say what you will,
but kids need two parents.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.365
l dare you to come over here
and say that to my face.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.076
l decline that dare
on the grounds that you will hit me.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.997
Hey there, little buddy.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.167
Don't pretend like he didn't kick.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.753
Right, that's it.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.631
Time for a nap.

16:06.841 --> 16:07.883
Purse, please.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.051
Sit still.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.305
l can't do my job if you keep moving.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.766
Life's a moving target. You know it's true.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.226
We'll settle up when you're done.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.355
Mark Glotzbocker.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.274
That's my legal name, not my real name.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.109
My real name's Lonna Hilton.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.986
Lonna 'cause it's pretty

16:28.071 --> 16:29.446
and Hilton 'cause it's fierce.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.199
lf l'm ever on the lam,
you're in charge of my name.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.867
l'm thinking Ginger something.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.621
Wouldn't it suck if the one thing
that makes life worth living

16:37.705 --> 16:39.623
is the thing that's making me sick?

16:39.707 --> 16:41.667
You know what l think?
l think transitions are hard.

16:41.751 --> 16:42.793
l'm telling you right now

16:42.877 --> 16:46.129
if l have to go back to living
as Mr. Mark Glotzbocker,

16:46.214 --> 16:47.422
l will fucking kill myself.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.841
Let's just see what
the blood work says, okay?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.218
Want some magazines?

16:51.302 --> 16:52.803
Tic Tacs and Vogue. You gots?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.054
l gots.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.976
Do you know who the father
of O'Hara's baby is?

17:00.061 --> 17:01.645
-l do not.
-You swear?

17:01.729 --> 17:03.897
-l swear. Why are you asking?
-'Cause if you don't know,

17:03.981 --> 17:05.982
then obviously she doesn't
have a father figure in place,

17:06.067 --> 17:08.026
which means the daddy slot is wide open.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.404
-Don't call it a slot.
-Copy that.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.786
-l have a question.
-l've got a million.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.081
Pharmaceutical side effects of estrogen,
what's the deal?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.376
Depends on the delivery system.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.461
lnjections are rough on the liver.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.131
Pills, long-term high dose,
liver and stomach.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.425
The smoothest delivery, transdermal.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.301
Costs more, but if shit's contaminated,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.512
i.e. immunodeficient, ulcerative,

17:35.596 --> 17:37.264
it's the patch or the morgue.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.349
Check out the brain on Eddie.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.393
Still got it.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.147
How are you doing?

17:45.815 --> 17:47.315
l can still ask that, right?

17:48.276 --> 17:49.443
How are you holding up?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.363
He's coming after the kids.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.157
Jesus.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.284
Oh, fuck me.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.202
Why? What's the matter?

17:59.287 --> 18:01.413
He... He was in here.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.915
He was making a list
of the shit that you were on.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.208
He what?

18:05.334 --> 18:07.711
He barged in. He started taking notes.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.504
What the fuck was l supposed to do?

18:09.589 --> 18:10.839
You could have told me, Eddie.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.549
Maybe l could have done something.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.925
Do you understand?

18:14.010 --> 18:16.803
He's coming after me, guns loaded.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.307
lt's not a fucking joke. He's gonna win.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.352
-Jackie, one more question.
-No.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.188
-You're a mom, right?
-Go away.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.482
-Do you think kids need dads?
-No.

18:35.490 --> 18:39.367
Dr. Cruz is requesting
a sitz bath and some lmodium, please.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.497
Notice anything different?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.583
No.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.836
What about now?

18:54.175 --> 18:56.718
Cocksucker! Motherfucker!
Where's my ring?

18:56.844 --> 18:57.844
Eddie, where's my ring?

18:57.929 --> 18:59.596
Wait, where's the last place you saw it?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.723
On my finger! What do l do? What do l do?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.975
The first thing you do is you relax.
You gotta stay cool.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.353
-Cool, check!
-Yes, you need to keep breathing.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.855
-Breathing, check.
-You need to retrace your steps.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.565
Social butterfly. Next idea.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.359
-Pray. Pray to Saint Anthony.
-O mighty Father...

19:12.443 --> 19:14.194
-Not here, not here.
-Christ.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.030
Be more specific.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.866
Move!

19:20.451 --> 19:22.661
Right, the good news is
we've got to the bottom of it.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.080
The bad news is
you're no longer tolerating the estrogen.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.123
All you're saying is that
my body is not cooperating,

19:27.208 --> 19:28.583
and that's not news to me, okay?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.710
Just give me my things.
l've got places to be.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.671
Lonna, you've contracted Hepatitis B,

19:32.755 --> 19:35.340
which means your body's susceptible
to infection. You're really vulnerable.

19:35.466 --> 19:38.176
Okay, and l asked nicely.
Can l have my things, please?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.804
Look, it's not that simple.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.639
A bleeding ulcer left untreated

19:42.723 --> 19:44.724
combined with Hep B, it could kill you.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.227
You've got my card.
Could you run it, please?

19:58.406 --> 20:00.240
Get away from my desk.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.659
l lost my ring.

20:02.743 --> 20:03.827
l told you not to wear it.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.288
-Will you look for me, please?
-No.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.582
l'll do dinner and dishes for a week.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.311
-My clairvoyant nurse.
-Zoey lost her ring.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.812
Halfway there.

20:30.897 --> 20:31.938
Take a look. You, too, Zoey.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.274
Looks like a robot's foot.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.985
No, that's just good old-fashioned medicine.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.653
What's with the pocket?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.780
l was just closing out a bill.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.365
Charitable works, not a charity.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.159
Wow, somebody was listening.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.712
You're leaving against medical advice,
really not wise.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.881
l'm not interested in wise, okay?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.342
Y'all wake up, throw on a lipstick,
some Louboutins,

21:00.426 --> 21:02.135
and no one asks you if you're really a girl.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.722
l've got five years of injections
and two years on the pill.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.308
So don't ask me to go backsliding,
'cause l won't.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.976
lnsurance won't pay for the patch?

21:10.061 --> 21:13.188
Please. The only way l'm paying for patches
is if l start turning tricks,

21:13.481 --> 21:17.734
and l'm not doing
a sashay-shanté cliché for anybody.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.319
l've got a job, okay?

21:19.403 --> 21:21.112
With vacation days and a 401 K.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.615
You're in the wrong place, young lady.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.116
No, baby, l'm in the wrong body.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.160
l'm fully aware of that.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.662
Where you need to be is Callen Lorde.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.455
lt's a clinic at 1 8th and l don't know what.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.207
They specialize in gender transitions.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.334
They'll pay for your patches,
monitor your health.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.754
Thirty years of dealing with social services,

21:37.838 --> 21:39.172
l know where the goodies are stashed.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.134
Upside, baby. Downside, bladder.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.594
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.055
Let's get you in the right place.
Card, please.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.769
Legal name, Mark Glotzbocker.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.856
Opens up a host of complications.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.149
That card is good. l pay my premiums...

21:58.234 --> 22:00.443
Keep your mouth shut. Watch and learn.

22:00.528 --> 22:04.280
Now, Mark Glotzbocker is insured,
not very well, by the way.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.283
Gastrografin, blood work, antibiotics...

22:07.368 --> 22:08.618
Before the deductible,

22:08.703 --> 22:11.329
Mark owes us something
in the neighborhood of $3,200.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.206
That's my Cabo money.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.625
But all the charts are in Lonna's name.

22:15.710 --> 22:16.835
Do you see my predicament?

22:16.919 --> 22:18.044
l do.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.047
Mark is insured. Lonna's not.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.383
Mark owes $3,200.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.427
Lonna rides for free.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.471
Answer this next question very carefully.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.099
Are you Mark Glotzbocker

22:31.726 --> 22:33.685
or are you Lonna Hilton?

22:34.645 --> 22:37.355
Lonna Donatella Hilton, final answer.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.740
-l need Zoey.
-Ladies' room.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.038
Give me your hand. Close your eyes.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.789
Give me your hand.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.175
How did you find it?

23:05.259 --> 23:07.427
20/1 0 vision, better than an astronaut.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.600
Here's my quagmire.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.852
l think you mean "quandary."

23:16.937 --> 23:18.688
Only time will tell.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.984
Lenny slid the ring on, right?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.445
And l was like,

23:26.280 --> 23:28.782
"Wow, that is really nice."

23:29.950 --> 23:31.951
Which is how it should be.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.454
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.291
But then Coop slid the ring on

23:40.461 --> 23:42.128
and it was, like,

23:42.463 --> 23:44.214
oh, my God amazing,

23:45.549 --> 23:47.634
like amazing.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.260
Okay?

23:49.345 --> 23:52.514
And l don't think it's because he's a doctor
or because he smells good

23:52.640 --> 23:54.390
or because he's super hot.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.393
l think it's because
maybe Lenny isn't the one.

23:57.478 --> 24:00.063
And l'm not saying that
Coop is the one either...

24:00.147 --> 24:01.231
Zoey.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.317
Really? Me? Why?

24:04.777 --> 24:07.779
-Because l...
-Because you are the hermit

24:08.322 --> 24:11.074
who lives in the cave
and gobbles up wisdom.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.575
That is why.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.953
So, what am l, Yoda?

24:15.037 --> 24:17.664
Hey, Jackie, Coop found my ring.

24:18.374 --> 24:19.791
l'm glad to hear it.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.418
Hey, Jackie, l just want to say it again.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.504
l'm sorry if l made things worse.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.881
Yeah, don't worry about it, Eddie.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.092
What should we have for dinner?

24:30.261 --> 24:31.511
SpaghettiOs.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.190
This is Jackie.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.030
Okay.

25:15.598 --> 25:18.641
Now he's suing me for child support.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.311
And the house, he wants to take my house.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.730
l'll get you the best lawyer in the world.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.316
That jacket's Chanel.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.234
You should definitely take it.
Your lawyer will love it.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.570
He's gonna say l'm an unfit mother.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.654
Well, you're not.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.241
See? Look how great your legs look.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.495
He's got receipts. He's got rehab.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.080
He's got a list of everything l took.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.333
l work 60 hours a week.

25:43.709 --> 25:47.128
l'm a drug addict. l'm around drugs
for 60 hours a week. Come on.

25:47.504 --> 25:48.671
l had an affair.

25:48.756 --> 25:49.756
So did he.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.758
Mine lasted four years.

25:52.343 --> 25:53.968
He's a perfect husband, perfect father.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.596
He looks good, l look bad, end of story.

25:57.848 --> 26:00.516
l could punch you in the face
and take Polaroids to bolster your case.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.769
You're sweet to offer.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.190
By the way, nothing started going bad
until after l got sober.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.399
l'm just saying.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.151
That's not true.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.031
l was afraid to go home tonight.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.491
Yeah, so was l.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.201
Cooking dinner on a hot plate,

26:18.285 --> 26:21.037
surrounded by half a million dollars'
worth of shoes l can't even wear,

26:21.121 --> 26:23.665
Coop circling my unborn baby.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.041
What's more frightening than that?

26:25.834 --> 26:28.795
Zoey in my kitchen
stirring SpaghettiOs in a kimono.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.303
And this.

26:41.892 --> 26:44.227
lf l'd gone home,
l would have ground it and snorted it

26:44.311 --> 26:45.687
before l got through the front door.

26:50.651 --> 26:51.818
So let's swap.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.654
Virgin Mary and a little Chanel

26:56.240 --> 26:57.615
in exchange for a Roxy.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.827
No, l'd rather have the pill.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.621
lt's a good one.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.376
What if l throw in the shoes?

27:15.676 --> 27:16.926
Okay.
