00:00.542 --> 00:02.044
<i>Previously on</i>
Recovery Road...

00:02.044 --> 00:04.129
What is this reality show
mess really all about?

00:04.129 --> 00:05.839
I just want
my little girl back.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.257
I have her tattooed
on my thigh.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.884
Not her face,
but her name.
You want to see?

00:08.884 --> 00:11.512
‐Maybe later.
‐You want good
Jamaican food?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.138
You come to my restaurant.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.140
‐My priority is us.
‐Mine, too.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.808
‐Is that right?
‐Is it?

00:16.808 --> 00:18.519
‐I messed it up.
‐Messed up what?

00:18.519 --> 00:21.146
The job I had
those last six months
I was sober.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.732
Wes, this is my mom.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.150
‐Hey.
‐Please go.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.944
I wouldn't want to
have to call the police.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.112
Cautionary tales don't
usually have happy endings.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.241
‐Look who's here.
‐Hello there, Wesley.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.119
It's okay. Let him in.
This is Asa.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.455
‐He's my brother.
‐My daughter is missing!

00:38.455 --> 00:40.707
My little girl
is missing!

00:43.126 --> 00:44.836
Maddie's voice:
<i>They tell you to live</i>
<i>your sober life</i>

00:44.836 --> 00:47.130
<i>one day at a time.</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:49.883
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>you have to live it</i>
<i>one hour at a time.</i>

00:51.093 --> 00:52.636
<i>Or even one minute.</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:56.890
<i>Or even one second</i>
<i>at a time.</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:58.976
What do you mean?
What do you mean,
she's missing?

00:58.976 --> 01:00.978
She took her!
She took my baby!

01:00.978 --> 01:02.312
‐Who? Who took her?
‐My mother!

01:02.312 --> 01:03.605
What the hell's
going on down here?

01:03.605 --> 01:05.107
Trish's mother
took her daughter.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.150
I went to tell my mom
that I got a job,

01:07.150 --> 01:10.404
but her house was empty,
her number disconnected.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.781
‐She took her.
‐But she has custody, right?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.866
No, she had
physical custody.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.452
She is not allowed
to take Nevaeh outside
of county lines

01:17.452 --> 01:18.870
without my permission.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.582
‐That's kidnapping.
‐You guys, we need
to call the police.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.127
Wait, Laurel.
Laurel, wait.

01:25.127 --> 01:28.422
I already called the cops.
They're on their way.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.884
She can't do this.
Where is she?

01:32.884 --> 01:35.554
What if she took her
out of the country?

01:35.554 --> 01:37.389
What if I can't find her?

01:37.389 --> 01:39.433
What if I never
see her again?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.393
Shh, shh. Okay.
Breathe.

01:42.644 --> 01:43.937
Breathe.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.149
We will find her.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.942
‐We're going to find her.
‐Okay.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.236
‐Where's Craig?
‐He's outside.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.823
I'll go get him.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.742
You don't understand.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.452
Maddie's voice:
<i>They say that when</i>
<i>a child is abducted,</i>

01:58.452 --> 02:00.495
<i>the first 48 hours</i>
<i>are critical.</i>

02:03.290 --> 02:05.667
‐I can't be here.
‐Good. Then leave.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.377
Why are the police
after you?

02:07.377 --> 02:08.545
Don't be stupid, Wes.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.298
Craig's out there.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.883
And plus,
there's a fence.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.093
Not a good idea
to be seen by the cops
climbing a fence.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.679
The basement?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.306
I don't want him
to distract the police

02:19.306 --> 02:21.350
from Trish
and her daughter.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.309
Downstairs, now.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.311
Let's go, okay?

02:24.311 --> 02:25.771
In there.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.274
Maddie's voice:
<i>There are times</i>
<i>that fly past you</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:30.609
<i>at breakneck speed.</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:33.070
Good evening,
we're looking for
Patricia Tomlinson.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.321
My little girl
has been taken.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.656
She's been kidnapped.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.699
Good evening,
officers.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.872
Maddie:
<i>And there are times</i>

02:43.872 --> 02:45.832
<i>when every second counts.</i>

02:47.209 --> 02:49.419
(music playing)

02:50.462 --> 02:54.299
<i>♪ This time is my time,</i>
<i>so step aside ♪</i>

02:54.299 --> 02:56.593
I don't know where
she was taking her.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.720
We're talking about
a kidnapping, not a playdate.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.055
We just need to clarify

03:00.055 --> 03:01.932
that this wasn't some
misunderstanding.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.266
Misunderstanding?

03:03.266 --> 03:05.435
Do you want to know
what a misunderstanding is?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.229
That you're not getting
that this woman

03:07.229 --> 03:09.147
ran away with my daughter.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.649
How long has it been
since you've seen them?

03:10.649 --> 03:12.025
Just a couple of days.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.361
And was it
at your mother's residence?

03:14.361 --> 03:17.531
Yeah, they were there,
and now they're gone.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.616
You were just at
your mom's Thursday, right?

03:19.616 --> 03:22.703
‐Everything was fine.
‐And you are?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.247
‐Why does that even matter?
‐It's okay, Trish.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.540
They're just
trying to help.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.084
‐I'm sorry. Your name?
‐I'm her roommate.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.420
I'm her friend,
Maddie Graham.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.881
Why are you guys
wasting all this time?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.092
Shouldn't you be
out there looking for her?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.760
They could be halfway
to Mexico by now!

03:38.760 --> 03:40.011
They could be anywhere!

03:40.011 --> 03:42.139
We called in the description
of your mother's vehicle

03:42.139 --> 03:43.890
to the CHP, Ms. Tomlinson,
and they're on it.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.642
See? They're on it.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.436
We just need a photo
of the child.

03:47.436 --> 03:51.481
Nevaeh. She has a name.
It's Nevaeh.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.482
How are you
going to find her

03:52.482 --> 03:54.317
if you can't even
remember her name?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.486
We need a photo of Nevaeh
so we can enter her

03:56.486 --> 03:59.030
into the National
Crime Information Database.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.533
Okay.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.160
I'll find a picture.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.620
You stay here and talk
to the detectives.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.422
(whispering) Hey, hey.
How's it going up here?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.340
Trish is freaking out.

04:17.340 --> 04:21.344
Rightfully so,
but she's not exactly
helping the situation.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.182
‐How's it going down there?
‐Swell.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.561
‐I'll let you know
when they're gone.
‐Thanks.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.198
They're going to
be here awhile.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.407
This is messed up.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.576
No, harboring a fugitive

04:44.576 --> 04:46.703
in the basement
of a sober house is messed up.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.872
‐What did you do?
‐It's not my fault.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.374
<i>Diesel was picking up Oxy</i>
<i>with a fake script.</i>

04:51.374 --> 04:53.210
<i>No big deal.</i>

04:53.210 --> 04:55.337
<i>‐But then he decided to hold</i>
<i>the guy up for his stash.</i>
‐Whoa, whoa!

04:55.337 --> 04:57.839
He's a pharmacist!

04:57.839 --> 04:59.341
He dispenses medicine

04:59.341 --> 05:01.927
for people with
real prescriptions.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.637
‐It's not a stash!
‐Whatever!

05:03.637 --> 05:06.389
I only pulled my gun
after Diesel fired his,

05:06.389 --> 05:07.849
<i>and that was because</i>
<i>that pharmacist</i>

05:07.849 --> 05:09.476
<i>started waving</i>
<i>a bat at his head.</i>

05:09.476 --> 05:11.311
(both shouting)

05:11.311 --> 05:13.104
Back up! Back up!

05:13.104 --> 05:15.899
Nobody got shot
or anything.

05:15.899 --> 05:19.528
You really don't know
how upside‐down you are.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.784
I don't get it.
Dad's gone?

05:25.784 --> 05:28.453
Yeah, baby.
He's gone.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.956
He gambled away all of our money
and he took off.

05:30.956 --> 05:35.085
‐He sucks.
‐But he'll be back, right?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.964
You know what?
Screw him.

05:38.964 --> 05:42.717
Life is going to be
way better without him
getting pissed all the time.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.428
From now on,
we are going to have fun,

05:45.428 --> 05:49.683
because now we can do
whatever we want.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.771
We can play all day
and we can stay up all night.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.648
Come on,
let's draw on the walls.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.024
I always thought this room
needed some color.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.068
Come on.
Come on, let's draw!

06:00.068 --> 06:02.028
Come on!

06:06.199 --> 06:08.243
Welcome to the funhouse.

06:18.503 --> 06:22.215
‐What do you
need me to do?
‐Um, stay? Help?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.050
Vern took a bunch
of the residents to LA

06:24.050 --> 06:25.385
for a big
Sunday night meeting.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.637
‐I could use some help.
‐Yeah, I was planning on it.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.599
Trish is working
with this lawyer
on her custody case.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.268
She gave me his card,
but I can't find it.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.604
I moved some files
to the basement. BRB!

06:35.604 --> 06:37.689
Sure.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.656
Wait, Craig, I‐‐

06:46.656 --> 06:48.617
What the hell
is he doing here?

06:48.617 --> 06:51.661
‐I remember you.
‐Yes, and I remember you.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.417
Maddie's voice:
<i>When I look back on all</i>
<i>that happened tonight,</i>

06:57.417 --> 06:59.002
<i>it's baffling to me</i>
<i>that we didn't see it</i>

06:59.002 --> 07:01.046
<i>all coming like</i>
<i>a freight train.</i>

07:02.589 --> 07:05.258
<i>But none of us had the time</i>
<i>to really think.</i>

07:49.844 --> 07:52.806
<i>A magician's greatest</i>
<i>trick is distraction.</i>

07:56.893 --> 07:59.229
‐(chattering)
‐Man: Just keep writing.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.231
Trish:
I don't know what to write!

08:01.231 --> 08:03.400
Any impressions that come
to mind would be useful.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.776
I know this is‐‐

08:04.776 --> 08:06.736
What's going on?

08:06.736 --> 08:09.364
We're looking at online
missing children
support stuff.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.491
Good, and Trish?

08:11.491 --> 08:15.870
Well, they asked her
to write a detailed
description of Nevaeh‐‐

08:15.870 --> 08:20.667
It's bad.
She can't write.
She can't even talk.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.629
What am I
supposed to tell you?
I have no idea.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.798
Why are we
even doing this?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.925
Just go find her, please!

08:28.925 --> 08:31.720
I can't find any pictures
of Nevaeh. Sorry.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.139
Can you come up
and help me, Trish?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.068
They're wasting time.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.820
If anything happens to her,

08:48.820 --> 08:50.655
I'm suing
the whole damn city!

08:50.655 --> 08:52.032
Trish, they are
trying to help.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.366
We are all
trying to help.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.826
You need to calm down.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.661
No, no!
They're not trying to help!

08:56.661 --> 08:58.204
They know I'm an addict!

08:58.204 --> 09:01.124
The system doesn't care
about people like me!

09:01.124 --> 09:03.084
They think that
she's better off!

09:04.419 --> 09:06.838
But they don't know
what it's like
to be with my mother.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.216
If she was truly
fit to be a mother,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.594
you think I would
have turned out
the way I did?

09:15.138 --> 09:17.348
‐What is that?
‐A Xanax.

09:20.894 --> 09:25.315
My aunt gave one
to my mother
the night my dad died.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.650
She told her
she needed to be strong

09:27.650 --> 09:29.319
for her daughter,
for me.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.821
It helped her deal.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.616
‐Where did you get that?
‐It doesn't matter.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.622
Now you need to be strong
for your child, okay?

09:40.622 --> 09:43.750
Listen to me,
I know you don't believe it,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.294
but those cops,
they want to find Nevaeh.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.713
That's what they do.
We all want to find Nevaeh.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.716
But you can't help us do that
if you're freaking out.

09:53.301 --> 09:57.972
If you need this
to pull yourself together...

10:00.100 --> 10:02.310
I won't say a word.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.237
There you go.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.949
All right.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.660
Now, take a deep breath.
All right.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.704
Breathe.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.671
Oh, my God.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.006
She's beautiful.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.343
She looks just like you.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.930
It's "heaven" backwards.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.182
‐What is?
‐Nevaeh.

10:42.433 --> 10:46.604
N‐E‐V‐A‐E‐H.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.815
That is really pretty, Trish.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.822
I named her that because...

10:55.822 --> 10:57.824
she's my salvation.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.036
This little girl
right here, Maddie,

11:02.036 --> 11:04.289
she's my salvation.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.131
I don't know
if I trust Cynthia.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.091
It just doesn't seem right

11:15.091 --> 11:17.177
that Maddie's
high school counselor

11:17.177 --> 11:20.388
should have that level
of involvement
in her recovery.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.683
‐It is a bit unusual.
‐See? I thought so.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.770
That's why I'm here.
I needed to talk to
another mother about this,

11:27.770 --> 11:31.357
somebody who gets
where I'm coming from
as a parent,

11:31.357 --> 11:32.984
but also knows
the program.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.235
Glad to be of service.

11:34.235 --> 11:39.199
Now, your sponsor
is supposed to be somebody
you tell everything to.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.950
You don't want that
to be the same person

11:40.950 --> 11:42.493
trying to get you
into a good college.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.496
Right? And...

11:47.707 --> 11:49.667
Go ahead and say it.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.169
It just feels like
she's trying to steal

11:51.169 --> 11:52.837
my daughter away from me.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.674
You tell her
she needs to mind
her own children.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.135
‐She doesn't have any.
‐See? There you go.

11:59.135 --> 12:02.889
Tell her,
"No stop a donkey
where you no own."

12:02.889 --> 12:05.183
That means mind
your own damn business.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.727
‐Shut it down.
‐Oh, I did.
I put an end to it.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.355
Good. Everyone always thinking
they know how to raise a child,

12:10.355 --> 12:13.066
but meanwhile,
they have no idea.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.569
Tell me about it.
And being a single parent?
It's even worse.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.363
Amen, girlfriend.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.157
Come talk to me
after you heard a baby
curse you to the devil

12:21.157 --> 12:23.201
for taking away
their candy.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.830
We're a lot alike,
you and me!

12:30.416 --> 12:33.002
Okay, you need to leave,
right now.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.379
If the cops see him leaving,

12:34.379 --> 12:36.881
the house will be investigated
for harboring a fugitive.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.342
Oh, well, thank you
very much, Wes,

12:39.342 --> 12:41.010
for making a bad night
horrendous.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.513
He'll be out of here
the second they leave.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.431
The very second, okay?

12:45.431 --> 12:46.891
You got it, Harry Potter.

12:49.936 --> 12:54.023
We have already contacted
the Center For Missing
And Exploited Children,

12:54.023 --> 12:56.609
and they had a link
to this website,
Team Hope.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.653
It's a support network
for families with
missing kids.

12:58.653 --> 13:02.865
It says we should make
a flyer with Nevaeh's
picture on it ASAP.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.034
That is what we're doing.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.371
(cell phone ringing)

13:08.371 --> 13:10.373
‐I don't know this number.
‐Answer it.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.250
Maybe someone,
like, saw your post.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.876
Yeah.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.048
‐Hello?
‐Rebecca?

13:19.048 --> 13:22.010
Hi! How are you?

13:22.010 --> 13:24.304
‐Who is this?
‐It's Ellie.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.183
I really don't have time
for your stupid antics
today, Ellie.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.519
Could you hear me out?
This is important.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.938
‐I really can't‐‐
‐It's about Maddie.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.316
I'm worried about her,

13:36.316 --> 13:39.235
and she's been acting weird.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.862
Don't know, don't care.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.613
So you haven't
spoken to her?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.993
Hello?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.828
My spidey‐sense
is telling me

13:48.828 --> 13:51.497
you know more
than you're saying.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.791
I haven't seen
or talked to her,
nor do I care to.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.169
Satisfied?
Now, if you don't mind,
I really have to go.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.920
Rebecca, please,
just don't...

14:00.631 --> 14:02.467
Sorry.

14:04.594 --> 14:08.264
Yeah, well,
thank you for taking the time
to talk to me, regardless.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.183
All right.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.894
Attorney‐client privilege,

14:12.894 --> 14:15.938
but he intimated
that he was no longer
working with her.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.982
‐Really?
‐Yeah.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.151
I don't know.
It's just a bizarre
phone call.

14:20.151 --> 14:24.072
Maybe he‐‐
please don't take this
the wrong way‐‐

14:24.072 --> 14:26.949
but maybe he doesn't
think Trish should be
a mother right now.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.826
I've certainly had
the same thoughts.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.953
I don't think a guy
named "The Bulldog"

14:30.953 --> 14:33.081
turns down cases
out of altruistic beliefs.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.125
Craig, this may not be
a bad thing.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.920
‐The girl has been
taken from her mother.
‐Months ago.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.672
She was taken
from her mother
months ago.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.012
Okay.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.933
This is a pretty
accurate description.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.811
I put down
what food she likes,

14:54.811 --> 14:57.021
what she likes to play.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.899
Good.
That's good work,
Ms. Tomlinson.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.734
I know it's a lot
to handle.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.319
We'll call this in
right away.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.172
Biological mothers
are a slam dunk
in custody battles,

15:23.172 --> 15:25.091
so why would he
drop her case?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.968
Who knows?

15:26.968 --> 15:29.637
We've only heard
one side of the story,
and that's Trish's.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.430
Who knows what
that lawyer found out?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.933
There could have been
some abuse or serious neglect.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.061
Yeah, but what if
it is a case of Trish
getting a raw deal

15:37.061 --> 15:39.021
because of
her past addiction?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.440
Definitely a possibility.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.402
Oh, my God,
they're still here.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.112
Look at these.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.739
These are mine.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.784
‐I was counting‐‐
‐Counting your days.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.161
Yeah.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.038
Every morning
I would get a mug
and I'd make a mark

15:56.038 --> 15:57.999
knowing that I made it
through the day before.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.252
You were here 86 days.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.546
‐You counted them?
‐Yeah, of course I have.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.798
I've always wondered
if that person stayed sober.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.049
She did.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.178
And now I know
who vandalized the cabinet.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.346
‐I'll send you
the bill, of course.
‐Of course.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.944
You're not upset that‐‐

16:26.944 --> 16:29.071
I'm not condemning Trish.
I'm just‐‐

16:29.071 --> 16:31.157
Looking at
all the angles.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.117
‐Yeah.
‐I know.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.870
Sometimes children
should be taken away.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.538
Hmm. Yeah.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.665
But by Child Services,
not like this.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.501
Okay, you're right.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.758
The way you just said that,

16:48.758 --> 16:50.843
it doesn't sound like
you say that a lot.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.721
I don't.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.607
We should get this coffee
to the detectives.

17:04.607 --> 17:07.151
Absolutely.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.321
Maddie stopped by today
with a boy from
Springtime Meadows.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.282
I'm sure he's a good kid,

17:13.282 --> 17:15.409
but I don't know
anything about him.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.579
They're living under
the same roof.
His name's Wes.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.500
I can't help but wonder
if there's something
going on there?

17:22.500 --> 17:25.336
You can't give me
anything?

17:25.336 --> 17:27.213
Can you blame me
for being worried?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.131
I mean, they met
in a sober living
facility.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.634
There's no telling
what problems he has.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.595
First of all,
better she meet him
in a sober house

17:34.595 --> 17:38.182
than one of those wild
teenage parties, believe me.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.893
The stories those teen drunks
tell in meetings.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.814
Oh, well, good,
I guess.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.983
Wes is not a bad boy,

17:46.983 --> 17:49.402
but you should keep a hand
in that poker game.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.362
Boys will be boys,

17:51.362 --> 17:53.406
so my son,
he works for me.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.617
Because with young men,
better to keep them
under your thumb

17:56.617 --> 17:58.536
than out of your sight.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.748
Suspect's name is
Jackie Olivia Tomlinson.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.750
She's 45 years old.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.294
Yeah.

18:06.294 --> 18:09.463
We're uploading a photograph
to the site now.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.299
No priors, that's right.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.552
Are you sure you don't
want anything, Trish?

18:14.552 --> 18:15.886
No.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.599
Maybe.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.269
Do we have any more
ginger ale in the fridge?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.313
Yeah, I'll get it.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.277
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.362
They're still here?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.281
‐Yeah.
‐How's Trish?

18:36.198 --> 18:38.326
‐Better.
‐Good.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.372
I know it's probably
none of my business, but I‐‐

18:43.372 --> 18:44.749
Go ahead. Ask.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.502
I saw him attack you.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.047
Brother or not,
why do you just let him
back in your life?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.425
Hiding him in the basement
from the cops

18:54.425 --> 18:57.511
doesn't exactly constitute
letting him back into my life.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.599
‐Doesn't it?
‐Look, I know
this is all messed up.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.143
‐I don't like it either.
‐Like I said, it's none
of my business.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.272
But?

19:08.272 --> 19:10.524
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.326
No! No! No!

19:20.326 --> 19:24.038
Woman:
He just doesn't
get me, you know?

19:24.038 --> 19:28.376
I mean, we don't
like the same music,

19:28.376 --> 19:30.419
the same movies.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.380
He seemed like
kind of a douchebag.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.382
But he is good for dinner,

19:34.382 --> 19:36.550
so maybe I'll go out
with him a few more times,

19:36.550 --> 19:41.639
mostly because your daddy
hated him so much.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.435
Tony's dad is letting him
see this movie on Saturday,

19:46.435 --> 19:48.604
but it's R‐rated.
Can I go?

19:48.604 --> 19:52.316
Now, why would you ask me
a question like that

19:52.316 --> 19:54.360
when you already
know the answer?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.321
Of course you can.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.490
Don't worry,
it's rated R for violence,

19:59.490 --> 20:01.283
‐not for sex.
‐Okay.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.660
‐Can I go?
‐No!

20:02.660 --> 20:04.453
Sure! Oh, come on.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.871
Take your brother with you.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.457
We got to stick
together, us three.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.334
You boys know that, right?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.425
Why is mom
all of the sudden

20:17.425 --> 20:19.218
so interested
in finding Grandma?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.303
‐What?
‐She wrote Grandma
off years ago.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.305
Now all of the sudden
she's tracking her down?

20:23.305 --> 20:26.308
She just wants to know
who has power of attorney
since she doesn't.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.103
She figured you were
always Grandma's
favorite, so...

20:29.103 --> 20:32.356
That's all Grandma
means to her now? Money?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.235
‐She's broke.
‐What?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.529
Did she run out
of insurance scams?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.284
She's sick, Wes.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.495
Seriously sick.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.959
Trish:
See, I'm totally clean now.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.670
And I started
a new job today

20:54.670 --> 20:59.425
so the state might
give me more
visiting privileges

20:59.425 --> 21:02.553
and my mom just‐‐
she can't deal with that.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.804
Why is that?

21:03.804 --> 21:07.391
She thinks
I'm a bad influence
for Nevaeh.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.769
She's been really
religious lately.

21:09.769 --> 21:14.565
She said she needed
to find a way
to cope with life

21:14.565 --> 21:17.234
after "losing me to drugs."

21:19.487 --> 21:21.614
Thank you, Maddie,
for everything.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.330
I don't know.
My mom has tried, like,

21:29.330 --> 21:30.873
so many different things,

21:30.873 --> 21:33.584
like meditation,
Buddhism, 'The Secret."

21:33.584 --> 21:35.753
She's doing
something new now,

21:35.753 --> 21:39.340
where, like,
they don't believe
in doctors

21:39.340 --> 21:41.509
or medicine or anything.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.386
It's, like,
the Path of the Fellowship

21:44.386 --> 21:47.097
or the Light
of the Pathway?

21:47.097 --> 21:49.683
‐Path of Light Fellowship?
‐Yes, that's it.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.602
The Path of Light‐‐
whatever.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.521
Something stupid.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.943
Do you have a landline
in your office we could use?

21:58.943 --> 22:00.736
Yes. Yes, of course.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.533
Um, just through‐‐

22:05.533 --> 22:08.035
through there
on the table.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.541
The Path of Light Fellowship

22:13.541 --> 22:15.501
has a compound in Nevada,

22:15.501 --> 22:19.296
and they are very
resistant to law enforcement.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.090
Both California
and Nevada authorities

22:21.090 --> 22:23.133
have had a very hard time
getting children out of there.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.930
Oh, dear.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.687
(whispering)

22:42.486 --> 22:43.779
Okay.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.832
I need to tell you something.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.171
Trish was so freaked out.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.382
I wanted to do something
to calm her down.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.259
So, I...

23:05.259 --> 23:09.305
‐I gave her a pill.
‐What? What kind of pill?

23:09.305 --> 23:11.974
I found a Xanax
on the floor
under her dresser.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.767
You found a Xanax
under her dresser?

23:13.767 --> 23:15.185
Don't worry.
It's not hers.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.062
Okay, we'll get back
to that later.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.064
So, you gave Trish a Xanax.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.651
No, I gave her an antacid
and I told her it was a Xanax.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.486
Sorry, you did‐‐
you did what?

23:24.486 --> 23:26.280
It's the same color.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.324
I just didn't
give her a chance to
really look at it.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.159
You have got
to be kidding me.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.620
It's like‐‐ like a placebo.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.289
My friends and I
read about it online.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.542
We did it to somebody
at a party once.
It totally worked.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.586
‐Maddie!
‐She thinks she's
on something,

23:40.586 --> 23:41.879
‐but she's not on anything.
‐Thank you.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.631
I am familiar
with the placebo effect.

23:43.631 --> 23:44.924
But it calmed her down,

23:44.924 --> 23:46.926
and technically
she did not take any drugs.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.636
Yes, but she thinks she did,

23:48.636 --> 23:50.471
so technically
she did take drugs.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.435
Um...

23:57.895 --> 23:59.772
this was the real Xanax.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.609
I found it.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.154
It was a remnant.

24:18.123 --> 24:22.419
You were wrong,
Maddie, okay?

24:22.419 --> 24:24.296
You‐‐

24:24.296 --> 24:26.590
you were wrong.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.176
You were wrong twice.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.012
We'll deal with
all this later.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.681
I'm going to
have to test you.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.642
Are you going to tell Trish?

24:36.642 --> 24:39.812
No, not right now.

24:39.812 --> 24:43.649
She's, um... fragile.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.696
Do you think
they're going to find her?

24:50.322 --> 24:51.907
Yes, I think they will.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.001
I'm sorry.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.961
Really.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.723
How's it going?

25:15.723 --> 25:17.766
I think the font
is too small.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.436
Don't worry about that.
We just need to get them out.

25:22.688 --> 25:28.235
Where are we supposed
to find the money for
a $500,000 reward?

25:28.235 --> 25:31.530
Okay.
I'll cut that part.

25:31.530 --> 25:35.284
Then I just need to scan
the photo of Nevaeh
and insert it.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.828
(cell phone ringing)

25:37.828 --> 25:41.331
Hey, Paul.
I know. I'm so sorry.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.042
I should have called.

25:45.127 --> 25:47.671
It's a long story.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.381
I'll be home soon.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.220
I have to go.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.264
Oh, yeah.
Of course, of course.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.266
I feel really bad about...

26:00.934 --> 26:03.437
Let me cancel
this thing I have.

26:03.437 --> 26:06.273
No, no, no.
Honestly, don't worry about it.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.984
Go on, go.
I've got things
under control.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.029
Slightly.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.698
No, I really
want to be here.

26:26.043 --> 26:29.004
The font's a little small.
I don't know if it's readable.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.009
I thought you had
a thing tonight.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.053
‐Huh?
‐I was eavesdropping.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.721
Oh. Good.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.681
Yeah.

26:41.850 --> 26:46.230
‐You okay?
‐Just worried.

26:46.230 --> 26:50.150
I think I might have
done something
really stupid tonight.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.528
A couple of stupid
things, actually.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.239
Looks to me like
someone being of service.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.783
Really, Cynthia,
you going to do that now?

26:57.783 --> 27:00.494
I'm just proud,
that's all.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.587
Can I talk to you, Wes,
in private?

27:10.587 --> 27:13.423
‐Sure, I'll be right up.
‐This your new girlfriend?

27:13.423 --> 27:15.843
‐She's not my girlfriend.
‐Why did you come here?

27:15.843 --> 27:17.594
I think your girlfriend
is down on me because

27:17.594 --> 27:19.304
‐I was hanging with your ex.
‐I'm not his girlfriend,

27:19.304 --> 27:20.764
and I'm down on you
because I know

27:20.764 --> 27:22.140
that you and Harper
set Wes up

27:22.140 --> 27:24.101
so that Diesel
could get his money.

27:29.815 --> 27:33.777
I'm sorry, Wes,
I just wanted you to know
what kind of a liar he was.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.029
Your new girlfriend
is being a bitch
because she's jealous.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.823
‐I'm not his girlfriend.
‐She's not my girlfriend.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.993
I'm sorry.
Your new slut's jealous.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.374
Stop! Just stop!

27:47.374 --> 27:49.710
This is so stupid!
What is wrong with you?

27:57.175 --> 27:59.928
Um... uh...

28:09.771 --> 28:11.857
You okay?

28:11.857 --> 28:14.109
Yes, I've just...

28:14.109 --> 28:16.028
never seen a gun fly out
of someone's pocket.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.988
Go upstairs, Maddie.

28:17.988 --> 28:20.991
‐You're not going to‐‐
‐Shoot him? No.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.993
I think I can
restrain myself.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.912
You don't owe
this dumb‐ass anything.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.873
Not true.
I owe him an amends.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.337
Maddie, I'll be okay.
Go upstairs.

28:38.467 --> 28:41.762
Hey, remember the cops
are right upstairs.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.188
We'll keep Miss Tomlinson
updated on everything
as it comes in.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.815
You have our card,
so keep us aware
of any developments.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.276
Will do.
Thank you for everything.

29:14.753 --> 29:19.424
Laurel and Rebecca
made some flyers with
Nevaeh's picture on it.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.426
We're going to go out
and put them up.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.680
Yeah.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.390
That's nice.

29:28.016 --> 29:32.229
Why don't you
run yourself a bath?

29:32.229 --> 29:34.398
I bring you some
yerba mate.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.819
Okay.

29:38.819 --> 29:41.863
That's... something.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.423
This the same gun
you used to rob the pharmacy?

29:59.423 --> 30:01.299
I was not robbing it.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.928
Is it the same gun?

30:06.304 --> 30:07.556
‐I'll deal with it.
‐No, you won't.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.849
Asa, I know you.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.642
You're likely
to hold onto it

30:10.642 --> 30:12.978
or get caught
trying to ditch it
someplace stupid.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.105
‐Screw you.
Give me the gun.
‐I'm sorry, man.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.945
There's something
I've needed to tell you
for a long time now.

30:24.114 --> 30:27.576
You remember that
Stone Cold Steve Austin
action figure

30:27.576 --> 30:29.369
you used to have
when you were a kid?

30:29.369 --> 30:32.122
The one dad got for you
when he brought you
to Las Vegas?

30:32.122 --> 30:33.498
When we went to see
Wrestlemania.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.168
Yeah, and I had to
stay home with mom,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.670
‐got really bummed.
‐Where you going with this?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.590
Remember how
it got all melted

30:41.590 --> 30:43.216
and you always blamed me

30:43.216 --> 30:45.802
and I always denied
setting it on fire,

30:45.802 --> 30:47.429
but you didn't believe me?

30:47.429 --> 30:50.348
You even threatened
to push me off the roof
if I didn't confess.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.768
‐I didn't push you.
‐No.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.605
But I did end up falling off
and breaking my arm anyway.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.774
You never let me
forget that,

30:58.774 --> 31:01.234
always held it over me head
like I was the worst
big brother ever.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.944
‐I didn't set it on fire.
‐I know.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.488
I nuked it.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.073
You what?

31:06.073 --> 31:09.826
I put Stone Cold Steve Austin
in the microwave.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.286
I wanted to blow it up,

31:11.286 --> 31:15.832
but it only
sort of smoked and melted.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.376
Anyway, I did it,
I killed Steve Austin,

31:18.376 --> 31:20.378
and I apologize.

31:20.378 --> 31:24.549
You really think
this crap between us
is all about a doll?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.760
That's not all
there is to this,
and you know it.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.945
Yea, though I walk
through the valley
of a dead man,

31:44.945 --> 31:47.489
I shall fear
no evil people.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.990
That's not how it goes.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.992
Whatever.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.134
What's wrong with Mom?

32:07.134 --> 32:09.094
She's not like
other kids' mothers.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.138
What do you mean?

32:11.138 --> 32:12.973
It's not like Mom's
a bad person,

32:12.973 --> 32:16.560
she's just lonely.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.813
So, why doesn't
she just call Dad?

32:19.813 --> 32:24.067
I doubt she even
knows where he is.
He's gone and so is she.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.405
Just forget about them.
We don't need parents.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.115
I've got your back.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.331
You've always thought
you were better
than Mom and me.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.960
I don't need your apology.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.881
Okay, then.
I forgive you.

32:47.215 --> 32:51.219
‐For what?
‐For giving me meth...

32:51.219 --> 32:52.512
for the first time.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.690
All right, well,
the police are gone.

33:03.690 --> 33:07.152
And so are you.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.570
Get out of here.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.797
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.136
Is he...

33:34.846 --> 33:37.015
Gone? Yeah, he's gone.

33:39.935 --> 33:43.396
‐And the...
‐Yeah.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.066
‐The gun's gone, too.
‐Okay.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.485
And you?
Are you all right?

33:50.070 --> 33:52.155
I'm, uh...

33:52.155 --> 33:56.034
I'd rather not
get into it right now,
if that's okay.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.087
‐You're going to eat all‐‐
‐All at once? Yeah.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.505
It's my comfort combo.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.006
Don't judge me.

34:10.006 --> 34:12.259
It's a vestige
from my childhood.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.638
I'm sorry...

34:17.806 --> 34:21.142
my brother called you
my girlfriend today.

34:21.142 --> 34:23.728
I took more offense
to him calling me
your slut.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.272
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that, too.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.275
We're "so‐bros."

34:29.776 --> 34:31.945
We're sober bros.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.657
"Sobros."
I like that.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.080
How about one of those
awkward hugs
you're so good at?

34:42.080 --> 34:45.000
‐What?
‐It's not a sexy hug.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.210
No. Nothing sexy.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.671
It's a sober hug.
It's a bro hug.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.882
Sure, man.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.852
(cell phone ringing)

35:03.852 --> 35:05.437
‐I'm sorry.
‐It's okay.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.355
Oh, yeah.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.024
(cell phone ringing)

35:09.024 --> 35:10.525
‐Hey, Mom.
‐Hey!

35:10.525 --> 35:14.487
I was just calling
to say it was really nice
to meet Wes today.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.198
Wow. I'll tell him
you said that.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.366
Oh, that's good.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.077
Yeah, actually,
I was calling
to get his number.

35:21.077 --> 35:24.706
I have some work for him
if you think he's interested.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.833
Um, really?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.918
I mean, he's right here

35:28.918 --> 35:31.379
if you want
to tell him yourself.

35:34.591 --> 35:37.344
Hello, Mrs. Graham.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.763
Call me Charlotte, Wes.

35:39.763 --> 35:42.057
I have to say,
I was pretty impressed
with you.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.351
All that stuff
about Jim Leeno?

35:44.351 --> 35:47.687
I was wondering
if you'd want
to come work for me.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.440
That would be amazing.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.150
Actually,
I need someone tomorrow.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.611
I know it's short notice, but‐‐

35:54.611 --> 35:56.780
No, no, no, no.
I can make it work.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.907
Well, get my number
from Maddie

35:58.907 --> 36:01.743
and text me,
and I'll send you
the details.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.829
Thank you, Wes.
You are totally
saving me.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.540
No, no. Thank you.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.711
I'm going to be
working for your mother.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.005
That's not weird,
is it?

36:14.005 --> 36:15.965
Are you kidding?
That's amazing.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.967
Thanks, "sobro."

36:17.967 --> 36:19.427
See, I'm already starting
to hate "sobro."

36:19.427 --> 36:21.596
We got to think
of something else.

36:21.596 --> 36:22.931
Yeah.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.523
‐Crazy night.
‐Yup.

36:36.236 --> 36:38.154
You should know‐‐
just a heads up‐‐

36:38.154 --> 36:40.156
that phone call earlier,
it was...

36:44.035 --> 36:47.455
just some shady
credit card BS.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.624
I think they got
the house phone list
or something.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.959
Total rip‐off.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.294
Thanks.
I'll keep an eye out.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.630
Or an ear out,
or something.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.972
It's a masterpiece.

37:05.265 --> 37:08.768
I made the pic bigger,
so you can really see
Nevaeh's face.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.939
‐Can you zoom in on
the picture a little?
‐Yeah.

37:14.315 --> 37:17.193
That's Disneyland, right?

37:17.193 --> 37:18.445
What's that ride
in the background?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.613
It's the old
submarine voyage ride.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.116
I used to love it.

37:23.116 --> 37:25.326
Except the sea serpent.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.036
Didn't love that part.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.872
But it's Finding Nemo
now, right?

37:28.872 --> 37:30.999
Yeah, has been for years.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.254
I also really
like the teacups.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.854
Maddie's voice:
<i>There are times</i>
<i>when you wish</i>

37:52.854 --> 37:54.689
<i>that you could</i>
<i>unknow something.</i>

37:56.566 --> 37:58.318
<i>Like you could</i>
<i>go back in time</i>

37:58.318 --> 38:00.445
<i>before the thought</i>
<i>enters your mind.</i>

38:03.531 --> 38:05.158
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

38:05.158 --> 38:07.327
This water's
taking forever.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.622
Thanks.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.294
I know they're
going to find Nevaeh
and bring her back.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.046
‐Trish‐‐
‐It's just...

38:18.046 --> 38:19.297
this whole thing
has reminded me

38:19.297 --> 38:21.049
of how much Nevaeh
means to my life.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.468
‐Yeah.
‐Remember how I told you

38:23.468 --> 38:25.762
I have a tattoo
of her name on my thigh?

38:25.762 --> 38:29.224
Well, when she gets back,
which she will,

38:29.224 --> 38:31.643
I'm going to add
Nevaeh's face
to the tattoo.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.313
See?

38:39.484 --> 38:41.402
Right here.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.613
Maddie:
<i>And sometimes...</i>

38:43.613 --> 38:45.782
<i>time stands</i>
<i>completely still.</i>

38:45.782 --> 38:48.034
Right along
where her name is.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.411
See?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.249
She's never really gone.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.961
She's always
here with me.

39:01.464 --> 39:05.176
Maddie:
<i>Time may seem to stop,</i>
<i>but it doesn't.</i>

39:05.176 --> 39:07.971
<i>It keeps moving forward.</i>

39:07.971 --> 39:09.889
<i>Ready or not,</i>
<i>it doesn't care.</i>

39:12.058 --> 39:14.143
<i>No matter how much</i>
<i>you may want to rewind</i>

39:14.143 --> 39:15.812
<i>or flash‐forward,</i>
<i>you can't.</i>

39:20.775 --> 39:23.778
<i>You just have to hope</i>
<i>that the choices</i>
<i>you make in the now...</i>

39:29.659 --> 39:32.412
<i>don't ruin everything</i>
<i>that happens in the future.</i>

39:58.146 --> 40:00.148
I was just
in the bathroom with Trish

40:00.148 --> 40:02.650
and you know that tattoo
she always talks about?

40:02.650 --> 40:04.569
The one of her
daughter's name?

40:04.569 --> 40:07.071
Well, she showed it to me
and there's no tattoo.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.281
What?

40:08.281 --> 40:10.116
She pointed right at it,
like, "There it is,"

40:10.116 --> 40:14.621
and there's no tattoo.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.581
Why would a person
who loves their
daughter so much

40:16.581 --> 40:19.167
only have one photo of her?

40:19.167 --> 40:22.170
See, the child standing
in this photograph

40:22.170 --> 40:25.715
is standing in front of a ride
that was closed in 1998.

40:27.467 --> 40:31.512
This little girl
looks like Trish,
because she is Trish.

40:34.057 --> 40:37.393
I think Nevaeh's not real.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.649
It is possible that Trish
has lingering delusions

40:42.649 --> 40:44.233
brought on
by her meth use.

40:44.233 --> 40:47.111
‐We shouldn't be diagnosing.
‐Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.280
What do we do?

40:55.536 --> 40:57.413
Oh, Trish?

40:57.413 --> 40:59.207
Uh, hi.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.503
Could I ask you
to come into
my office, please?

41:03.503 --> 41:05.588
I'd like to talk to you.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.882
About what?

41:07.882 --> 41:12.261
Just about
this photograph here.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.431
I already know
what you're going to say.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.017
I've heard this before,
but I promise you,

41:18.017 --> 41:19.227
she's real.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.770
My daughter is real.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.982
I have to fight
this battle all the time.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.610
They're going to find her.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.655
You'll all meet her.
Oh, she's so cute.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.952
The police will find her.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.958
I have complete confidence.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.838
‐Trish?
‐I'm going to go to bed.

41:46.838 --> 41:50.758
Okay? Good night, you guys.

41:50.758 --> 41:54.804
And thank you so much
for all your help today.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.681
It really means a lot.

41:57.557 --> 42:00.601
Really.
I love you guys.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.771
And so will Nevaeh.

42:18.536 --> 42:22.540
