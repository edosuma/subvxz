WEBVTT

00:55.525 --> 00:57.305
You're late.

01:01.475 --> 01:03.555
I've been waiting, you see.

01:07.945 --> 01:11.055
You should have called first
if you wanted to meet.

01:11.355 --> 01:12.785
So, what are you here for?

01:12.805 --> 01:14.605
Your color doesn't look so good.

01:14.625 --> 01:16.235
Are you sick?

01:16.255 --> 01:18.735
I partied all night at a club.

01:18.765 --> 01:20.625
You know the air's not good in those places.

01:20.665 --> 01:24.115
That's so like you, Lee Yoon Sung.
Clubs and women...

01:24.135 --> 01:27.695
Oh, yeah.
The City Hunter sent me a video.

01:27.715 --> 01:30.515
It looks like Chairman Chun
is after my life.

01:30.545 --> 01:32.335
But, isn't the City Hunter
extremely gracious?

01:32.365 --> 01:36.275
Showing such concern
for the man who's chasing him...

01:36.405 --> 01:39.195
If I ever meet City Hunter,

01:39.215 --> 01:40.885
I'll let him know

01:40.905 --> 01:43.845
that Kim Young Joo is very very grateful.

01:47.055 --> 01:49.775
You look tired.
You should go and get some sleep,

01:50.095 --> 01:52.025
Poo Chai.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.295
When the City Hunter
was in the Golden Triangle area,

02:11.315 --> 02:14.015
he went by the name of Poo Chai.

02:14.145 --> 02:18.125
Just because time has passed, I don't
suppose you've forgotten the name, right?

02:22.065 --> 02:24.165
I've told you, haven't I?

02:24.185 --> 02:27.255
If you want to catch me,
then bring evidence,

02:27.595 --> 02:30.465
clear evidence that I'm the City Hunter.

02:30.485 --> 02:32.095
Don't worry.

02:32.115 --> 02:34.795
I'm going to catch you in the act.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.465
See you again,

02:37.485 --> 02:39.245
Poo Chai.

02:54.325 --> 03:00.295
Ahjussi, Ahjussi, oh...

03:00.815 --> 03:02.285
Hey!

03:03.065 --> 03:03.985
Hey!

03:04.005 --> 03:05.755
Yoon Sung.

03:08.245 --> 03:09.995
Let's go.

03:29.425 --> 03:31.005
You're up?

03:31.075 --> 03:33.275
Drink some of this.

03:34.135 --> 03:35.165
What is this?

03:35.185 --> 03:36.835
Kimchi juice.

03:36.855 --> 03:38.845
I don't know what gas you inhaled,

03:38.865 --> 03:41.585
but in the old days, when we inhaled
coal burning gas, we'd all drink this.

03:41.586 --> 03:42.986
Drink some.

03:50.845 --> 03:52.535
Take these.

03:53.235 --> 03:55.015
What are these?

03:56.005 --> 03:58.465
A few savings accounts and a fund account.

03:58.485 --> 04:02.345
And the deed to this house
and Na Na's place.

04:02.365 --> 04:04.595
So, why are you giving these to me?

04:04.615 --> 04:06.095
You manage them from now on, Ahjussi.

04:06.135 --> 04:07.675
I don't want to, Kid!

04:07.715 --> 04:09.515
You manage your own things.
Why leave it to me?

04:09.535 --> 04:11.505
With the money in there,

04:11.555 --> 04:14.205
you should be able to go back
to your hometown and live comfortably.

04:14.225 --> 04:16.495
Don't ever give gambling another glance,

04:16.515 --> 04:17.954
and shop in moderation.

04:17.995 --> 04:19.495
And,

04:19.625 --> 04:22.905
visit Na Na every once in a while
and take care of her.

04:23.205 --> 04:24.825
My mother too...

04:24.855 --> 04:25.815
Please look after them.

04:25.835 --> 04:29.265
Yoon Sung, what's the matter with you?
Why do you sound like you're going far away?

04:29.495 --> 04:34.555
I lived for a brief moment,
forgetting who I was.

04:42.585 --> 04:44.065
So obnoxious...

04:44.085 --> 04:46.935
Would it have killed him to just say,
"Okay, let's go"?

04:46.955 --> 04:49.225
I swear, it figures.

04:53.825 --> 04:57.015
Has something happened to Lee Yoon Sung?

05:06.675 --> 05:09.505
Ay!
You scared me!

05:10.465 --> 05:12.435
I absolutely did lock that door.

05:12.455 --> 05:14.435
You opened it and came in.

05:14.455 --> 05:15.875
Don't you dare get angry at me.

05:15.905 --> 05:17.555
Just a second.

05:26.035 --> 05:31.005
What happened earlier?
Was there an issue?

05:32.485 --> 05:35.315
Huh?
You're acting really strange.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.485
Why are you suddenly setting
a mysterious mood, making a girl tremble?

05:38.525 --> 05:40.285
Kim Na Na.

05:41.005 --> 05:45.995
Can you throw away
that kitchen table and that tablecloth?

05:46.795 --> 05:48.085
Why throw that away?

05:48.135 --> 05:53.045
My mom and dad passed that on to me,
I'm going to keep it forever.

05:53.235 --> 05:54.675
Do you want something to drink?

05:54.695 --> 05:56.645
Have you eaten dinner?
If you haven't, I can...

05:56.665 --> 06:00.285
How long are you going to keep holding onto
memories of people no longer by your side?

06:00.305 --> 06:02.105
Why are you acting like that, Lee Yoon Sung?

06:02.125 --> 06:05.275
Ending up having feelings for
or liking someone...

06:06.795 --> 06:09.985
I've never once imagined that.

06:10.195 --> 06:15.035
But, thinking of how hard it will be for you
if something bad happens to me,

06:16.515 --> 06:18.505
I can't bear it.

06:19.645 --> 06:22.705
I don't want to leave you with

06:23.455 --> 06:25.535
any memories of me.

06:27.465 --> 06:31.405
Kim Na Na

06:31.450 --> 06:32.625
 I like you.

06:34.805 --> 06:36.245
But,

06:36.265 --> 06:38.795
I don't think I'm going to be able
to let go of you.

06:41.185 --> 06:43.208
So...

06:44.343 --> 06:46.939
you let go of me first.

06:49.885 --> 06:52.305
W... why are you doing this?

06:53.075 --> 06:56.605
You know.
You know who I am.

06:56.635 --> 06:58.755
How I've lived...

06:58.775 --> 07:01.815
What might happen to me
in the next 1 minute, 1 second.

07:01.985 --> 07:07.955
Um, if it's because I told you I like you,
because you feel pressured,

07:08.475 --> 07:10.335
then, I'll take it all back.

07:10.355 --> 07:14.945
Just pretend you didn't hear it.
Or just ignore it.

07:14.965 --> 07:17.065
I can't now.

07:18.535 --> 07:21.005
I've told you I like you.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.975
This is my first

07:27.575 --> 07:30.045
and last request.

07:30.125 --> 07:33.255
I don't want to.
I'm not going to.

07:34.855 --> 07:38.075
You're not someone
who makes requests to others.

07:38.095 --> 07:40.515
I don't want to fulfill that request.

07:40.535 --> 07:42.245
Do it.

07:43.815 --> 07:45.375
Please.

07:47.235 --> 07:50.535
If for any reason,
I come looking for you first,

07:50.555 --> 07:52.725
don't accept me.

07:53.425 --> 07:55.395
Even if we run into each other accidentally,

07:55.415 --> 07:57.775
you be the one to ignore me.

07:58.675 --> 08:00.855
You be the one to let go of me.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.845
Kim Na Na.

08:06.295 --> 08:08.015
I'm sorry.

08:08.975 --> 08:11.015
For coming into your life...

08:12.465 --> 08:14.625
For swaying you...

08:16.875 --> 08:21.005
The reason my father told me not to love,

08:23.065 --> 08:25.455
I've now come to understand all too clearly.

09:48.285 --> 09:50.835
Let's stop crying, Kim Na Na.

09:52.415 --> 09:55.055
He says he's having a hard time.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.325
He says to forget him first.

10:00.925 --> 10:03.255
So, let's forget for him.

10:05.655 --> 10:11.545
It's better that you have a hard time
than him having a hard time.

10:33.345 --> 10:34.635
[Lee Yoon Sung]

10:35.905 --> 10:38.435
[John Lee]

10:39.975 --> 10:41.345
[Lee Kyung Hee]

10:48.555 --> 10:52.025
You haven't slept properly in days
because of your investigation.

10:52.045 --> 10:55.255
When you're tired, sweets are the best.

10:59.585 --> 11:01.295
Thank you, Investigator Kim Mi Ok.

11:01.315 --> 11:05.445
Stop saying thank you
with that apologetic expression.

11:05.925 --> 11:08.235
After I received your apology yesterday,

11:08.255 --> 11:13.850
I thought to myself, "What else can we do?
Let's forget everything. "

11:13.885 --> 11:17.185
Because of your father,
my sister-in-law passed away,

11:17.205 --> 11:20.935
and my brother has been lying in a hospital
for 10 years, and when I think of that,

11:20.955 --> 11:23.015
it does upset me.

11:23.035 --> 11:26.265
But that wasn't your fault.

11:28.005 --> 11:31.965
And you're an enthusiastic prosecutor
whom I like so much.

11:32.005 --> 11:35.025
Let's forget all that and work.

11:36.245 --> 11:40.157
Na Na probably feels the same way I do

11:40.158 --> 11:43.181
and is probably feeling too troubled
to call you.

11:45.225 --> 11:47.795
Prosecutor, we have a big problem.

11:47.835 --> 11:49.585
I heard it on the way in,

11:49.615 --> 11:52.655
but the classified document
from 1983 that was at the NIS

11:52.675 --> 11:53.895
has disappeared into thin air.

11:53.915 --> 11:56.245
From the NIS?
Does that make any sense?

11:56.275 --> 11:58.215
That's why it's such a shock.

11:58.245 --> 12:00.275
And Prosecutor, this...

12:01.065 --> 12:04.105
It's a reply from the Thai police
to our official request for assistance.

12:04.155 --> 12:07.275
They sent it
via international express service.

12:12.675 --> 12:14.535
Who is this?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.525
That's not Lee Jin Pyo.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.775
Who is that person?

12:21.605 --> 12:23.175
Prosecutor.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.755
No way!

12:24.775 --> 12:27.585
Those drug dealers picked out
Lee Jin Pyo's picture for certain!

12:27.605 --> 12:29.935
As the Golden Triangle's drug lord!

12:30.625 --> 12:32.635
Those drug dealers from that time,
bring them back in.

12:32.655 --> 12:34.695
Prosecutor,

12:34.715 --> 12:37.345
they were going to be tried in Thailand

12:37.365 --> 12:39.665
so they were extradited to their country
yesterday.

12:41.955 --> 12:44.735
You go to the NIS and find out immediately
why those classified documents disappeared.

12:44.755 --> 12:47.545
Investigator Kim Mi Ok, send another letter
to Thailand, requesting cooperation.

12:47.565 --> 12:50.045
Tell them to send all data on drug criminals
who have connections to Korea.

12:50.065 --> 12:51.205
I understand.

12:51.225 --> 12:53.795
Tell them, otherwise,
I'll go there directly myself.

12:55.765 --> 13:01.655
The Korean Public Prosecutor's Office
requested cooperation from the Thai Police?

13:01.675 --> 13:03.845
Yeah. Yeah. Kun Ta Sabat Chai,
thank you for your efforts.

13:03.865 --> 13:08.275
I will see you at the inauguration.

13:09.135 --> 13:10.545
Yes.

13:10.975 --> 13:12.985
Seeing that they've sent a request
to Thailand,

13:13.005 --> 13:14.955
don't you think
they've caught a proper scent of the trail?

13:14.975 --> 13:18.295
If Interpol cooperates and track the funds,
then what do we do?

13:18.315 --> 13:22.535
We'll have to figure it out
while the Thai Police drag out the time.

13:24.875 --> 13:28.025
I dismissed Kim Young Joo too easily
as a rookie.

13:28.065 --> 13:29.285
Excuse me, Boss.

13:29.305 --> 13:33.035
What are you going to do
with this classified document?

13:34.105 --> 13:35.875
The fifth person you're looking for
who's in this document...

13:35.905 --> 13:40.315
now that you know who it is,
isn't it time you exposed it to the world?

13:40.335 --> 13:41.345
What are you talking about?

13:41.365 --> 13:43.585
The reason I formed an alliance with you

13:43.615 --> 13:46.585
was partly to take revenge
for our killed comrades,

13:46.675 --> 13:50.035
but also to clear my brother's name.

13:50.055 --> 13:53.465
We must use this document to expose it all.

13:53.485 --> 13:55.775
The troops which suffered a wrongful death
by the hands of Chun Jae Man...

13:55.795 --> 13:58.305
now that they have been labeled criminals,

13:58.365 --> 14:00.745
I can no longer tolerate it.

14:01.385 --> 14:05.045
It is still the time for us
to keep our hidden card hidden.

14:05.075 --> 14:06.525
Why?

14:06.805 --> 14:09.315
Do you have some sort of reason?

14:09.615 --> 14:13.535
Because Yoon Sung
must bring it to its final conclusion.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.795
In providing security for Da Hye...

14:17.815 --> 14:20.015
isn't the cafe better
than her classes at the institute?

14:20.045 --> 14:22.785
There are occasionally
good-looking customers,

14:22.805 --> 14:26.405
and you can sit comfortably
on the sofa in the dressing room. Right?

14:30.295 --> 14:32.765
Oh, it's Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.

14:35.695 --> 14:38.525
Hello, Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.

14:40.705 --> 14:44.305
Agent Shin, I'll go ahead and find Da Hye.

14:50.885 --> 14:53.755
Aigoo, sorry for making you wait.

14:53.775 --> 14:56.745
My previous meeting went a little long.

14:56.775 --> 15:00.025
I'm the one who asked to meet with you,
of course I should wait.

15:00.045 --> 15:04.355
But, what you said
in that interview a while back,

15:04.375 --> 15:08.015
about the 1983 Special Forces Unit case...

15:10.005 --> 15:12.015
Is that true?

15:12.685 --> 15:14.485
Of course.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.759
They were planning to sell
classified national secrets

15:17.760 --> 15:20.150
for a little money
without even thinking twice.

15:20.245 --> 15:23.155
They weren't just criminals,

15:23.175 --> 15:26.755
they were a cancer to the Republic of Korea.

15:29.285 --> 15:30.905
A cancer?

15:30.955 --> 15:35.105
You know, even abroad, there are those
who spend their lives doing spy work.

15:35.145 --> 15:37.955
Ah, but, your reason
for coming to see me today?

15:37.975 --> 15:40.708
Ah... I hear

15:40.709 --> 15:44.582
there has been some ruckus at the Haewon
Chemicals plant due to the labor protest.

15:44.655 --> 15:46.825
From the media stories,

15:46.845 --> 15:49.155
I see they are demanding an
admission of an industrial accident.

15:49.175 --> 15:50.845
I thought it may be no small issue.

15:50.865 --> 15:52.985
It's not a big problem.

15:53.015 --> 15:56.655
Do you know how hard it is to get
acknowledgment of an industrial accident?

15:56.675 --> 15:59.625
In any case, hospital bills,
worker compensation,

15:59.655 --> 16:04.015
and adjustments to the working environment
will likely cost a lot of money.

16:04.365 --> 16:08.285
Is that possibly the reason
you're borrowing money from me?

16:08.305 --> 16:11.255
The financial situation
is already not in good shape.

16:11.495 --> 16:14.725
Why should I spend money on those people?

16:15.285 --> 16:17.235
Regarding the demands,

16:17.345 --> 16:19.735
even 100 won is too much
to give those laborers.

16:19.885 --> 16:24.305
I am purely a merchant
with an eye solely on the money.

16:24.605 --> 16:27.065
Why do you think
I spent an unreasonable amount

16:27.105 --> 16:30.295
to take over Han-Il Life?

16:30.575 --> 16:34.775
Then, do you have some other plan?

16:34.855 --> 16:40.105
I'm going to get
the medical care privatization bill passed.

16:40.125 --> 16:45.015
Will you provide strength in backing me?

16:48.995 --> 16:50.665
What do you mean
admit to an industrial accident?

16:50.685 --> 16:54.378
It would be better to
just admit to the industrial accident

16:54.379 --> 16:57.029
and refurbish the facilities.

16:57.064 --> 16:59.229
I'm saying give the workers
a safe working environment.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.035
And if we do admit it,

17:01.845 --> 17:05.015
there will be a string of lawsuits.

17:05.035 --> 17:08.244
If we turn a factory around to earn little,
then the whole company could be ruined.

17:08.265 --> 17:11.585
Then, are you saying you're going
to continue running your company,

17:11.615 --> 17:13.855
using the health of your laborers
as collateral?

17:13.885 --> 17:18.595
I have not strayed
from any standards laid out by law.

17:18.615 --> 17:22.295
It's just that some frail people
ended up working at our factory,

17:22.315 --> 17:25.265
and there's no reason I should have
to take responsibility for their disease.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.605
Look here, Chairman Chun!

17:26.625 --> 17:30.305
Because I want to do away
with health insurance

17:30.525 --> 17:33.025
and privatize medical care,

17:33.045 --> 17:38.275
they want to soil the image of my enterprise
and ruin me,

17:38.315 --> 17:42.025
but I will stop at nothing

17:42.045 --> 17:44.575
to push through with privatization.

17:44.615 --> 17:50.615
And, Mr. President,
if you refuse till the end to help me...

17:50.865 --> 17:52.835
If I refuse...

17:53.415 --> 17:56.135
Even other than Operation Clean Sweep,

17:57.095 --> 18:01.895
remember I am the one and only person

18:01.915 --> 18:04.015
who knows your weakness.

18:04.575 --> 18:06.245
Then...

18:18.815 --> 18:21.745
Yeah, the person I had you look into before.

18:21.775 --> 18:23.315
Find that person right away.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.815
All right.

18:26.735 --> 18:31.085
A lot of hand sanitizer is necessary
in the sterile rooms, so I bought some.

18:31.105 --> 18:33.975
Why spend your money on things like that?

18:34.025 --> 18:36.715
I'm sure you have many things
you need to spend money on.

18:36.745 --> 18:39.205
Don't say things like that.

18:39.225 --> 18:44.385
I'd like it if you got well quickly and
is able to live happily with Lee Yoon Sung.

18:45.735 --> 18:47.555
Thank you.

18:48.005 --> 18:52.505
But, why don't you come
together with Yoon Sung these days?

18:52.545 --> 18:54.905
Did something happen?

18:54.945 --> 18:56.425
No.

18:56.465 --> 19:01.155
It's just Yoon Sung is busy
and it's hard to get our schedules in sync.

19:01.175 --> 19:02.805
Yeah?

19:12.165 --> 19:18.165
Because Na Na, so full of life and energy,
is beside Yoon Sung,

19:18.265 --> 19:21.075
I'm always grateful.

19:55.745 --> 19:57.165
Yoon Shik.

19:57.185 --> 19:59.495
There are so many doctors in there.

19:59.535 --> 20:02.255
Your mom will be okay.

20:16.155 --> 20:17.395
See?

20:17.425 --> 20:20.315
Noona told you your mom would be okay,
right?

20:20.335 --> 20:22.235
You really did.

20:22.735 --> 20:27.295
Is the stuff that makes your lips sparkly
expensive?

20:27.315 --> 20:28.385
Why?

20:28.405 --> 20:33.315
I thought if my mom put on some of that,
she wouldn't look sick.

20:34.445 --> 20:37.035
Is this enough to buy some?

20:37.355 --> 20:40.035
Mmm, I'm not sure.

20:40.225 --> 20:42.285
I think that much should be plenty.

20:42.305 --> 20:43.525
Really?

20:43.545 --> 20:45.045
Then, please go with me to buy some.

20:45.065 --> 20:45.995
Yes?

20:46.035 --> 20:50.205
Uh... Okay.

20:50.235 --> 20:51.775
Let's go.

20:51.965 --> 20:55.715
What time were the Health and Welfare
committee members coming to the clinic?

20:55.735 --> 20:56.995
5 o'clock.

20:57.025 --> 20:59.395
Mr. Lee says
he will be at the hospital directly.

20:59.415 --> 21:04.085
Aigoo, that bunch won't even look at things
unless they're top of the line.

21:04.105 --> 21:09.295
What clothes do I need to pick
for the assemblymen to wear proudly?

21:13.725 --> 21:15.765
Mmm, this.

21:17.495 --> 21:19.165
And this.

21:19.185 --> 21:22.075
Put that in a case,
but wrap them separately.

21:22.095 --> 21:23.705
There's something
that I need to put in there.

21:23.725 --> 21:25.785
Yes, I understand.

21:31.155 --> 21:32.785
What?

21:33.005 --> 21:34.775
It's nothing.

21:38.975 --> 21:40.775
This is the prettiest, don't you think?

21:40.795 --> 21:41.695
Yes.

21:41.715 --> 21:43.255
I bet Ajumeoni will like it.

21:43.285 --> 21:44.775
Let's go.

21:45.895 --> 21:47.825
Please ring this up.

21:47.845 --> 21:50.175
And how will you pay for it?

21:50.195 --> 21:52.015
With this.

21:52.535 --> 21:56.155
He's been saving for months
to buy his mom a present.

21:56.175 --> 21:58.105
And the banks are all closed.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.415
That will be difficult.

22:00.435 --> 22:06.045
You aren't our only customers. When
would I be able to count all these coins?

22:06.115 --> 22:08.035
Ah, I see.

22:08.085 --> 22:11.055
Then, I'll count it and when I'm done,
I'll call you.

22:11.075 --> 22:12.495
Customer!

22:12.515 --> 22:13.865
I'm sorry,

22:13.885 --> 22:17.335
but our store doesn't sell things
that require hundred won coins in change,

22:17.355 --> 22:20.585
so we really have no use
for these hundred won coins.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.405
Please visit us next time.

22:22.435 --> 22:28.295
Excuse me, but you speak as though
10 won and 100 won coins aren't money,

22:28.315 --> 22:29.715
but they are money.

22:29.735 --> 22:31.745
Please ring us up.

22:32.815 --> 22:37.015
You bring a child in here
and act like such a nuisance.

22:37.055 --> 22:40.015
What did you just say?

22:44.105 --> 22:47.035
Ring up the sale using this
rather than the coins.

22:48.725 --> 22:53.075
Customer, we don't have change for this.

22:53.095 --> 22:54.665
I'm sorry.

22:54.685 --> 22:56.915
You look down on 10 won and 100 won coins,

22:56.935 --> 22:59.305
and you don't even have the money
to make change for this?

22:59.675 --> 23:00.445
Look here.

23:00.465 --> 23:03.315
Before you go on with "look here"
or "see here," start by apologizing.

23:03.335 --> 23:04.895
If you can't even sense with what thoughts
a child has saved up this money

23:04.925 --> 23:08.325
and why he's trying to buy something
like this, then why sell your products?

23:08.345 --> 23:10.465
From what I see,
your sense of service,

23:10.485 --> 23:13.855
personality, speech and actions
are all worth less than a 100 won coin.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.635
There aren't any 100 won people
in the world.

23:15.675 --> 23:18.975
Treating people with discrimination
is extremely low.

23:18.995 --> 23:21.025
Completely indecent...

23:21.245 --> 23:23.745
I'm sorry.
I will rectify the situation.

23:23.765 --> 23:27.985
Not to me.
Apologize to them.

23:31.025 --> 23:34.345
I'm sorry.
I will rectify the situation.

23:44.755 --> 23:47.885
I'll take Yoon Shik.
You go on.

23:48.675 --> 23:52.255
And, one more thing...

23:52.465 --> 23:55.525
I'd like it
if you didn't come to the hospital anymore.

24:02.045 --> 24:03.925
[Waiver of Industrial Accident Claim]

24:03.965 --> 24:07.605
The moment you stamp it, the money gets
automatically transferred into your account.

24:07.625 --> 24:12.275
Of course, the hospital bill
will also be covered by the company.

24:13.325 --> 24:15.465
I can't stamp this.

24:15.665 --> 24:19.005
That's betraying the people
who all agreed to do this together.

24:19.475 --> 24:21.695
The 16 other people
have already stamped and signed.

24:21.725 --> 24:24.265
You are the last one, Choi Myung Sook.

24:24.655 --> 24:26.005
Excuse me?

24:36.435 --> 24:38.595
Think about your son.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.895
At his age, he should be running around
but he's trapped in a hospital.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.975
Don't you feel bad about that?

24:44.165 --> 24:46.415
Rather than holding out for something
to be deemed an industrial accident

24:46.435 --> 24:48.275
and suddenly passing away,

24:48.295 --> 24:51.255
wouldn't it be 100 times better
to take the company money and...

24:51.256 --> 24:53.349
raise your son happily at home?

25:13.675 --> 25:16.265
Check your account.

25:16.295 --> 25:18.515
The money should have been deposited.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.175
It's me.

25:27.425 --> 25:31.535
I got the waiver,
so the "industrial accident" is history.

25:32.885 --> 25:35.628
We're going to have to properly crush

25:35.663 --> 25:38.767
those protesters in front of the factory,
so they can't even squirm,

25:39.015 --> 25:41.025
Admission, acknowledgement, yeah whatever...

25:41.045 --> 25:43.835
Handle them just to the point
where they don't lose their lives.

25:53.985 --> 25:57.775
Admit it! Admit it! Admit it!

25:57.795 --> 26:00.325
Laborers are people!

26:02.705 --> 26:05.095
- What...?
- What's going on?!

28:07.285 --> 28:09.105
Go relay this to Chairman Chun.

28:09.125 --> 28:11.715
That he's going to have to admit
to an industrial accident...

28:22.955 --> 28:25.275
C... City Hunter?

28:26.025 --> 28:27.695
He took the waiver?

28:27.715 --> 28:31.165
Suk Doo Shik, what good are you, Punk?!

28:31.225 --> 28:32.705
Chairman.

28:32.725 --> 28:36.555
If you move, you won't see any results.

28:36.795 --> 28:38.725
<i>Chairman Chun,</i>

28:38.765 --> 28:41.265
<i>my local constituency</i>

28:41.295 --> 28:43.345
<i>thinks that I look younger because of this,</i>

28:43.365 --> 28:46.535
<i>and they all like it.</i>

28:47.845 --> 28:50.135
<i>Thank you, Chairman Chun.</i>

28:50.155 --> 28:52.195
Yes, of course.

28:53.495 --> 28:55.235
I'm hanging up.

28:57.205 --> 28:58.165
Unni.

28:58.215 --> 29:02.405
For my dad, do you think
this would suit him better, or this one?

29:02.425 --> 29:04.975
Since he has a clean complexion,
anything will do...

29:05.025 --> 29:06.775
It's good I do part-time job, right?

29:06.795 --> 29:09.585
Otherwise, I wouldn't have even been able
to buy him a birthday present.

29:10.285 --> 29:12.665
Huh?
This is pretty.

29:12.685 --> 29:15.455
- Don't you think it will look pretty on me?
- Yeah. It's pretty.

29:15.475 --> 29:17.805
Unni, do you know there's an anti-cafe
created about me?

29:17.825 --> 29:18.835
Anti-cafe*?
(*internet forum against someone)

29:18.855 --> 29:20.995
That time I got into a fight
at the karaoke place,

29:21.015 --> 29:24.745
the video has been spread all over
and they created ChoiDaHye.com.

29:24.765 --> 29:26.675
They were bad-mouthing my dad,
so how could I hold myself back?

29:26.695 --> 29:29.825
I may not be a very good student,
but it's not like I can't read Hangul.

29:29.845 --> 29:32.845
If only I didn’t have a stomach ache then,
I would have taught them a lesson!

29:32.865 --> 29:36.785
Anyway, they say they won't leave me alone
and that they'll come after me.

29:37.295 --> 29:38.665
You don't think they really will, do you?

29:38.685 --> 29:41.555
They'll be able to find out
you work at the cafe right away.

29:41.575 --> 29:43.335
They'll come after you and...

29:43.355 --> 29:45.345
Do you know how scary those people are?

29:45.365 --> 29:46.675
Really?

29:46.695 --> 29:48.325
No, it can't be.

29:48.345 --> 29:52.355
I'm supposed to be tutored
by Dr. Lee Yoon Sung at the cafe today.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.725
At the cafe again?

29:55.495 --> 29:58.665
Oh, that's just depressing.

29:58.715 --> 30:01.175
Excuse me, it's okay to go up there, right?

30:01.215 --> 30:04.862
To get rid of stress...
Can you loan me some clothes?

30:16.165 --> 30:17.084
Be careful.

30:49.345 --> 30:51.145
Da Hye, you said you wanted some bread,
right?

30:51.165 --> 30:53.025
I'll go buy some.

30:54.675 --> 30:56.535
Hey, Choi Da Hye!

30:57.585 --> 30:59.225
Do you think being the president's daughter
is everything?

30:59.255 --> 31:00.465
You call me a nut job?

31:00.495 --> 31:02.815
You're nothing!

31:20.035 --> 31:22.285
Stop this right now, you guys!

31:23.075 --> 31:25.535
Do you want to be dragged
to a police station?

31:30.805 --> 31:31.815
Da Hye, are you all right?

31:31.835 --> 31:33.205
You're not hurt?

31:33.225 --> 31:36.265
Unni, are you all right?

31:36.285 --> 31:38.775
Kim Na Na, are you all right?

31:38.795 --> 31:40.785
I'm fine.

31:42.585 --> 31:43.355
Clean up.

31:43.375 --> 31:45.515
I can clean myself.

31:45.585 --> 31:48.795
Agent Shin, watch over Da Hye.

31:56.095 --> 31:59.435
The first and second
are equivalent equations,

31:59.455 --> 32:01.665
and the third and fourth are generally...

32:01.705 --> 32:04.215
Teacher, I don't really understand.

32:04.235 --> 32:06.935
Can you explain this one more time?

32:06.955 --> 32:09.154
Hmm? Oh...

32:09.225 --> 32:14.945
So, the fifth and si... sixth
are also identical.

32:24.585 --> 32:26.855
Your hospital room seems kind of empty.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.875
Shall I bring a photograph of Father
from your home?

32:29.915 --> 32:33.875
I don't think there is a remaining
photograph of your father.

32:33.895 --> 32:37.305
Then I'll get one from
the Presidential Security Service album.

32:37.985 --> 32:41.525
Is there something going on with you?

32:42.125 --> 32:45.115
No.
There's nothing going on.

32:45.145 --> 32:47.415
There is something, isn't there?

32:47.435 --> 32:49.765
Your face doesn't look well.

32:51.415 --> 32:54.025
Is it something you can't tell me?

32:56.325 --> 33:04.375
Actually, being registered here
with a strange name is rather odd,

33:04.415 --> 33:10.175
and Jin Pyo told me you were dead.
Why would he tell me that sort of lie?

33:10.195 --> 33:12.385
That's all strange too.

33:12.915 --> 33:15.275
There's something going on, isn't there?

33:16.155 --> 33:18.765
Is it something you can't tell me?

33:18.975 --> 33:22.025
When it's all over, then I'll tell you.

33:22.045 --> 33:23.135
Don't worry.

33:23.155 --> 33:25.875
You can't tell me now?

33:25.895 --> 33:27.715
I'm worried.

33:27.735 --> 33:29.775
It's nothing big.

33:29.815 --> 33:33.455
You just get better quickly.

33:35.705 --> 33:39.305
For the time-being, I'm going to be busy
so I don't think I'll be able to come often.

33:39.325 --> 33:42.645
When I can't come,
Shik Joong ahjussi will come in my place.

33:42.665 --> 33:44.355
Yoon Sung.

33:44.375 --> 33:46.475
It seems visiting hours are almost over.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.895
I'll leave now.

33:47.915 --> 33:49.645
Rest up.

34:01.025 --> 34:02.515
Mom.

34:04.815 --> 34:07.785
I don't think liking and caring for someone

34:08.945 --> 34:12.005
is always just a happy thing.

34:22.135 --> 34:23.355
What is it, One Hundred Won?

34:23.375 --> 34:26.395
Read this to me.
I don't know my letters.

34:26.425 --> 34:29.485
I'm bored waiting for my aunt.

34:30.685 --> 34:34.534
You know money so well,
and you don't know how to read?

34:35.375 --> 34:37.725
Come here.
I'll read it to you.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.715
"Sleep well. Have good dreams,"

34:41.735 --> 34:43.705
she says, then gives me a kiss

34:43.725 --> 34:45.995
and covers me with blankets.

34:46.725 --> 34:50.065
And then, I dream of Emma.

34:50.085 --> 34:53.705
So, an elephant is the main character.

34:53.725 --> 34:54.905
That's right.

34:54.925 --> 34:58.355
And Emma is this elephant's
imaginary human friend.

34:58.375 --> 35:00.495
His ears are really big.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.955
They are floppy floppy floppy ears.

35:03.005 --> 35:04.995
Right.
They are floppy ears.

35:05.035 --> 35:08.525
<i>Floppy eared*, physically strong, loved
to eat, (*also means gullible and trusting)</i>

35:08.545 --> 35:11.805
and particularly loved it
when I touched her.

35:12.685 --> 35:13.835
Unbelievable...

35:13.855 --> 35:16.155
It's true I'm trusting,
physically strong, and love to eat,

35:16.195 --> 35:18.765
but I don't appreciate skinship.

35:19.985 --> 35:21.785
Floppy eared...

35:22.275 --> 35:23.985
Na Na...

35:25.315 --> 35:28.275
Strong and loves to eat...

35:30.155 --> 35:31.995
Hey, One Hundred Won.

35:32.295 --> 35:34.655
That person who trounced
on your precious 100 won coins,

35:34.675 --> 35:36.475
should Hyung teach him a lesson?

35:36.495 --> 35:38.125
Yeah.

35:45.745 --> 35:47.435
Welcome.

35:47.465 --> 35:48.615
This is Steve Lee.

35:48.635 --> 35:50.905
- I'm Steve Lee.
- Yes, it's a pleasure.

35:50.935 --> 35:54.145
- I'm Chief Prosecutor Park.
- I'm Steve Lee.

36:03.565 --> 36:04.595
[Seoul District Prosecutor's Office,
Chief Prosecutor Song, Chief Prosecutor Park
- Dinner At Korean Restaurant]

36:05.275 --> 36:08.775
Chief Prosecutors Song and Park.

36:09.925 --> 36:12.755
What happens when prosecutors meet?

36:44.775 --> 36:46.995
Why are these people...?

36:52.865 --> 36:53.575
Prosecutor.

36:53.595 --> 36:55.715
Prosecutor, where are you going?

36:55.735 --> 36:57.875
- Please drink.
- Ah, yes.

37:13.905 --> 37:19.575
<i>I do recognize that Haewon
Chemicals' facilities have become outdated.</i>

37:19.615 --> 37:22.615
<i>There's also quite a lot of talk
within the Public Prosecutor's Office,</i>

37:22.635 --> 37:23.802
that the criteria for accidental hazards

37:23.803 --> 37:26.807
seem especially relaxed
just in Haewon Chemicals' case.

37:26.875 --> 37:30.665
Well, isn't that why I arranged a meeting,
hoping for your support?

37:30.685 --> 37:35.035
I'd appreciate it if you, Chief Prosecutors,
could often block that sort of trouble.

37:35.675 --> 37:39.815
Here, this is seaweed.

37:39.835 --> 37:44.485
It has been prepared purely in the
traditional way. The taste is very good.

37:45.275 --> 37:49.175
You're always looking out for our health.
Thank you.

37:49.195 --> 37:51.395
- We'll be sure to enjoy it.
- Ah, yes.

37:51.425 --> 37:52.750
Kindly, if you please,
I'd appreciate your influence

37:52.751 --> 37:55.846
on people's attitudes and opinions
at the Public Prosecutor's office.

37:55.855 --> 37:58.235
and your courage and resourcefulness
in investigating,

37:58.255 --> 38:00.715
so that it may benefit
the development of my company.

38:07.595 --> 38:09.515
What is this?

38:09.885 --> 38:12.645
Chief Prosecutors, shouldn't you be
in the Prosecutor's Office or at home?

38:12.665 --> 38:15.905
But, having lunch, drinking,
and even accepting gifts from businessmen?

38:15.925 --> 38:17.655
What in the world are you doing right now?

38:17.695 --> 38:21.685
You receive one award
and now you think nothing can touch you?

38:21.705 --> 38:25.285
- Are you trying to teach us right now?!
- Chief Song, lower your voice.

38:25.305 --> 38:26.565
There are other people outside.

38:26.585 --> 38:28.665
<i>It's just that this kid's actions
are a joke.</i>

38:28.685 --> 38:31.595
<i>It's because of people like you two
that prosecutors are getting a bad name!</i>

38:31.615 --> 38:32.605
What?!

38:32.625 --> 38:34.485
You, Punk!

38:38.085 --> 38:40.955
You just look after yourself, Kim Young Joo.

38:40.975 --> 38:45.795
Covering up a crime to protect your own
father, where do you get off giving sermons?

38:45.815 --> 38:48.495
Isn't that excessive
coming from a young man?!

38:50.955 --> 38:55.675
Leave those... before you go.

38:55.845 --> 38:56.765
What?

38:56.785 --> 38:58.885
Have you lost your original intentions?

38:58.905 --> 39:01.385
Don't you have any pride as a prosecutor?

39:01.435 --> 39:03.160
How do you plan to carry out
fair and impartial investigations,

39:03.161 --> 39:04.554
receiving this sort of crap?!

39:04.555 --> 39:06.015
All right.

39:06.035 --> 39:09.355
All right, so let go of my hand!

39:14.945 --> 39:20.925
Chairman Chun, did you arrange this meeting
to humiliate me?

39:21.305 --> 39:23.045
How could that be?

39:23.065 --> 39:26.235
You are such a famous figure these days.

39:26.445 --> 39:32.035
It's frightening to even eat lunch
or receive a piece of seaweed from you.

39:33.295 --> 39:37.795
Well, then,
II will just say hello in passing.

39:48.315 --> 39:50.755
Seriously, why are you doing this?

39:52.515 --> 39:54.805
I was easy on you
because you were a friend's son.

39:54.825 --> 39:57.505
But isn't this too much?!
Huh?!

39:57.775 --> 40:00.565
This bit of seaweed
is also considered bribery?!

40:00.585 --> 40:02.275
Huh?!

40:19.705 --> 40:24.805
They say fools rush in
where angels fear to tread.

40:24.845 --> 40:26.795
I will be seeing
the prosecutor general shortly.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.245
I'll be sure and speak well of you.

40:29.415 --> 40:32.495
I suppose this angel of a man
must have been quite scared of this fool.

40:32.515 --> 40:36.225
A staged suicide... isn't any fun.

40:36.245 --> 40:37.215
What are you talking about?

40:37.255 --> 40:41.535
1983, Operation Clean Sweep...

40:45.235 --> 40:50.275
You said in your interview
that they were all killed in open waters,

40:50.765 --> 40:54.515
but when I brought up the waters off Nampo
that you wanted to hide,

40:54.595 --> 40:57.035
I suppose you were very uncomfortable.

40:59.225 --> 41:01.645
Suddenly, I had this thought.

41:01.665 --> 41:05.015
In that incident back then,
perhaps not everyone was killed.

41:05.050 --> 41:07.495
Perhaps there was someone who lived.

41:07.515 --> 41:11.985
And so to expose that incident,
he's sending me signs.

41:14.045 --> 41:16.185
Chairman Chun Jae Man...

41:16.505 --> 41:18.775
Could it really be possible

41:20.405 --> 41:23.785
that there was not one survivor
from that incident?

41:29.895 --> 41:32.061
If I were to learn about the full story
behind Operation Clean Sweep,

41:32.062 --> 41:34.342
I wonder if you can remain that staunch.

41:34.345 --> 41:36.485
I'll wait and see.

42:00.625 --> 42:04.785
You received a target warning
from the City Hunter, didn't you?

42:06.515 --> 42:08.335
You received that and hid it?

42:08.355 --> 42:09.215
Why?

42:09.255 --> 42:12.705
Because your father Kim Jong Shik
was the third target?

42:12.725 --> 42:14.465
Are chief prosecutors just figureheads?

42:14.485 --> 42:16.135
You don't know how to report?

42:16.175 --> 42:20.925
Ultimately, you let the City Hunter get away
and Kim Jong Shik was his victim.

42:20.945 --> 42:25.465
So, how does it feel to be toyed with
as a pawn in his game? Is it fun?

42:25.485 --> 42:27.265
Does it feel like living?

42:28.955 --> 42:31.445
We'll decide the course to take with you
at the Chief Prosecutor's Meeting,

42:31.465 --> 42:34.225
so take your hands off
Chun Jae Man's case immediately.

42:35.105 --> 42:35.915
What do you mean course to take?

42:35.945 --> 42:38.315
You intend to stay on
in the Special Investigations department?

42:38.335 --> 42:39.565
You've got some big dreams.

42:39.585 --> 42:40.765
Chief.

42:40.805 --> 42:43.805
The fact that the City Hunter sent a warning
was part of the plan.

42:43.825 --> 42:47.165
The bastard knew who my father was.

42:47.185 --> 42:50.695
That's why he sent me the warning,
to see what I'd do.

42:50.745 --> 42:53.545
He wanted me
to bring in my father on my own.

42:53.565 --> 42:54.721
If I didn't move according to his will,

42:54.722 --> 42:56.842
he planned to denounce
the entire Public Prosecutor's Office!

42:56.845 --> 42:59.775
So, if you knew the plan,
why didn't you report it?!

42:59.825 --> 43:02.585
You've put me in a position where I can't
do anything even if I wanted to, Kid.

43:02.605 --> 43:05.515
It's too much of a headache,
I can't help you any longer.

43:05.535 --> 43:06.521
Remove yourself from Chun Jae Man's case

43:06.522 --> 43:10.015
and whatever is decided at
the Chief Prosecutor's meeting, follow it.

43:10.055 --> 43:13.545
Whether it's probation
or regular attendance...

43:15.215 --> 43:17.035
Chief!

43:23.525 --> 43:24.555
E... Excuse me?

43:24.575 --> 43:27.465
Security for the president?
Me?

43:27.495 --> 43:30.855
As Jung Mi Young left, he recommended you.

43:30.875 --> 43:33.705
I don't necessarily find you suitable,

43:33.745 --> 43:36.745
but you did block Da Hye
from the egg attack yesterday,

43:36.765 --> 43:39.605
and even if you did get your gun taken away
when you had Seo Yong Hak as your charge,

43:39.655 --> 43:42.975
but the decision is based on the fact that
you've shown adept skill in many situations,

43:42.995 --> 43:46.555
so get your head on straight
and do a good job.

43:47.025 --> 43:48.625
Yes.

44:07.155 --> 44:11.035
Uh? Teacher,
you pull out the beans from your rice too.

44:11.285 --> 44:13.065
Yeah, I don't like beans.

44:13.105 --> 44:17.545
If my mom see it, she'd nag the 3 of us.

44:18.145 --> 44:19.345
It's a secret from your mom.

44:19.365 --> 44:22.035
If she knows,
the two of us are in big trouble.

44:22.785 --> 44:27.005
Dr. Lee, the reason
I wanted to meet with you today...

44:27.025 --> 44:29.345
Let me ask you frankly.

44:29.365 --> 44:33.285
Can our Da Hye get into college?

44:38.125 --> 44:40.735
What answer do you want?

44:40.755 --> 44:46.095
Well, as a parent,
wouldn't I want a favorable answer?

44:46.455 --> 44:50.225
I think I will have to give you
an unfavorable one.

44:50.435 --> 44:51.505
I think it will be difficult.

44:51.535 --> 44:53.245
I'm sorry.

44:53.455 --> 44:56.035
Ah... Okay.

44:57.095 --> 44:59.065
Ah, I feel refreshed lighter, Teacher.

44:59.115 --> 45:00.585
Since you said that...

45:00.615 --> 45:01.855
Hey, Da Hye.

45:01.875 --> 45:07.105
Dad, it felt like you were expecting me
to go to college, so I couldn't tell you,

45:07.125 --> 45:10.295
but studying really isn't for me.

45:10.415 --> 45:12.925
I want to give up on college.

45:15.555 --> 45:16.885
Da Hye, Kid,...

45:16.905 --> 45:21.275
Even if I go to some lowly college
with my grades, you'll be ashamed.

45:21.295 --> 45:24.345
And if I go study abroad,
that's a total waste.

45:24.365 --> 45:28.585
Being the first president in Korea's history
to have a daughter who doesn't go to college

45:28.605 --> 45:30.875
will probably be severely embarrassing,

45:30.915 --> 45:34.235
but if you could just bear it...

45:34.665 --> 45:37.295
I want to go work at a cafe.

45:37.315 --> 45:39.935
- Da Hye, you...
- I've worked part-time there briefly,

45:39.955 --> 45:45.525
but earning money with my own hands,
I felt proud of myself for the first time.

45:46.225 --> 45:49.165
I don't want to go to college,
but become a barista.

45:49.185 --> 45:53.015
You have to think seriously
about the future.

45:53.335 --> 45:56.015
I thought about it all through high school.

45:56.055 --> 45:59.395
But I hesitated and couldn't say anything

45:59.425 --> 46:01.845
because I thought you'd be ashamed
if I didn't go to college.

46:01.865 --> 46:06.605
I insisted on the tutoring
because I like Dr. Lee Yoon Sung...

46:06.615 --> 46:11.225
and just wanted to see more of him.

46:22.355 --> 46:27.365
Because of my immature daughter,
I've ended up looking like an idiot.

46:27.395 --> 46:29.465
I'm embarrassed to face you.

46:29.495 --> 46:32.015
Taking time out of your busy schedule
to tutor her...

46:32.035 --> 46:35.075
It must have been hard
to make such a decision,

46:35.125 --> 46:37.475
but you made that difficult decision.

46:37.715 --> 46:42.165
In any case, you have quite some courage.

46:43.485 --> 46:44.205
Excuse me?

46:44.225 --> 46:47.755
Even if she was a bad student,
it's to her father whom you said,

46:47.805 --> 46:52.025
"It will be hard, it will be difficult
for her to go to college. "

46:52.645 --> 46:55.275
I'm just not good
at beating around the bush.

46:55.295 --> 46:57.035
I'm sorry.

46:57.225 --> 47:00.225
Right.
My personality used to be like that.

47:00.245 --> 47:03.755
But living in the political arena,
I think I've all but become a sly old dog.

47:03.775 --> 47:07.245
Let's occasionally have dinner
together when my wife's away.

47:07.265 --> 47:09.770
It was rather embarrassing
to have my staff

47:09.771 --> 47:12.222
see an old president
pull beans out of his rice,

47:12.305 --> 47:14.525
so it's nice to have found a kindred spirit.

47:16.025 --> 47:17.655
Yes.

47:33.615 --> 47:35.215
Kim Na Na.

47:36.485 --> 47:39.545
I told you to take care of your face,
like a woman should.

47:39.975 --> 47:43.763
Put on some medicine and a band aid.

47:45.204 --> 47:46.863
Is that so hard?

47:46.885 --> 47:49.755
All right.
I'll do that.

48:07.835 --> 48:09.725
Kim Na Na, are you all right?

48:09.765 --> 48:11.775
I'm fine.

49:16.795 --> 49:18.785
Lee Yoon Sung!

49:23.995 --> 49:25.795
Stand right there.

49:33.885 --> 49:37.505
Coming here,
pathetically conjuring up old memories...

49:37.575 --> 49:39.155
I'll do that alone.

49:39.195 --> 49:41.345
There's no need for you to do it too.

49:41.365 --> 49:44.785
You're energetic, strong Kim Na Na
who smiles easily.

49:45.775 --> 49:47.385
Are you going to
continue feeling sorry for yourself?

49:47.425 --> 49:50.675
You made me this way.

49:50.765 --> 49:52.885
Made it hard to be energetic,

49:52.905 --> 49:54.515
hard to smile.

49:54.535 --> 50:00.015
I resent it hundreds,
no thousands of time every day.

50:01.105 --> 50:03.335
Why did I meet you?

50:03.355 --> 50:05.795
Why did it have to be you?

50:05.925 --> 50:07.815
To me, you

50:08.455 --> 50:14.455
are a presence that makes me
resentful, guilty, and regretful.

50:15.355 --> 50:18.005
Like a nightmare I don't want to remember.

50:18.155 --> 50:19.995
I told you.

50:20.575 --> 50:23.105
Go back to the time when you didn't know me.

50:23.125 --> 50:26.825
Go back and meet a better man than me

50:26.875 --> 50:29.805
and live every day happily and joyfully.

50:29.845 --> 50:32.205
Forget a guy like me,

50:32.245 --> 50:34.325
and live happily.

50:35.035 --> 50:36.785
Live like that.

50:47.645 --> 50:50.045
Is that really all you can say?

50:50.555 --> 50:54.755
To break apart, to let you go,
to forget you,

50:55.205 --> 50:58.565
to disappear from your life...

50:58.595 --> 51:02.165
I was able to understand
why you said all of those things.

51:02.185 --> 51:05.505
But, you can't say that to me.

51:05.525 --> 51:08.295
How can you tell me to meet another man?!

51:09.625 --> 51:12.595
It may be hard now,
but after a little time passes...

51:12.615 --> 51:14.635
You are really cruel.

51:15.985 --> 51:18.275
You are really too cruel.

51:22.745 --> 51:28.655
Couldn't I just

51:30.585 --> 51:36.585
wait until you finish
what you're doing and return to me?

51:39.365 --> 51:43.325
Then,
I'll forget everything you've said now.

51:44.595 --> 51:47.445
That's not hard.

51:47.485 --> 51:52.535
Can't you just say you'll return to me?

51:54.505 --> 51:57.015
If you don't answer me now,

51:57.615 --> 51:59.475
even if you return later on,

51:59.495 --> 52:01.745
I'm not going to take you back.

52:01.835 --> 52:05.795
I will really absolutely,
absolutely not take you back.

52:06.695 --> 52:08.495
So,

52:09.605 --> 52:11.795
couldn't you just tell me

52:12.945 --> 52:16.265
that you'll return to me when it's over?

52:18.025 --> 52:19.995
Please.

52:21.455 --> 52:24.255
Just tell me that one thing.

53:07.005 --> 53:08.565
Prosecutor.

53:08.585 --> 53:10.755
The classified document
missing from the NIS,

53:10.775 --> 53:12.485
they seem to be hush-hush about it,

53:12.505 --> 53:13.510
but the document manager

53:13.511 --> 53:16.434
has already resigned and the rumor is
he's getting ready to leave the country.

53:16.439 --> 53:17.735
You put in a departure prohibition order
on him, didn't you?

53:17.755 --> 53:18.655
Yes.

53:18.695 --> 53:20.325
Let's go.

53:23.905 --> 53:25.785
Jung Min Goo.

53:27.075 --> 53:28.745
Where is he?

53:28.785 --> 53:30.775
Jung Min Goo!

53:33.025 --> 53:35.765
- Call an ambulance right away.
- Yes.

53:36.625 --> 53:38.405
A person has collapsed here.

53:38.425 --> 53:40.175
The address here is...

53:40.225 --> 53:41.955
just a moment.

53:42.705 --> 53:44.225
Are you all right?

53:44.245 --> 53:48.786
The confidential document I gave
Chun Jae Man was a fake.

53:49.905 --> 53:53.135
Steve Lee has the real one.

53:53.155 --> 53:54.975
Steve Lee?

54:05.665 --> 54:07.975
Must you really do it this way?

54:08.725 --> 54:10.805
The revenge against the five.

54:11.795 --> 54:15.665
Earlier, you didn't know who the five were,

54:15.685 --> 54:18.645
but now we even have
that classified document.

54:18.665 --> 54:22.155
Why are you forming an alliance
with Chun Jae Man and throwing in bribes?

54:22.195 --> 54:23.935
Can't we just expose the document,

54:23.975 --> 54:27.255
make the 5 pay for their punishment
in front of the world,

54:27.445 --> 54:33.335
and clear the names of the troop
which died off the shores of Nampo?

54:34.275 --> 54:38.495
Now, you too are trying
to step on the breaks of my methods?

54:38.515 --> 54:41.325
If we cause Korea to rot,

54:42.115 --> 54:44.795
we are no different than they are.

54:45.285 --> 54:49.805
Actually, aren't we causing it to rot more?

54:49.825 --> 54:51.645
Impudent Punk...

54:52.785 --> 54:56.825
If I were going to clear their names,
I would have done it a long time ago.

54:57.475 --> 55:01.795
The last guy
is someone you can't even imagine.

55:03.765 --> 55:06.535
If you can't go with me on this,
stay out of it.

55:19.505 --> 55:20.475
Hello?

55:20.495 --> 55:21.925
<i>Lee Yoon Sung.</i>

55:21.955 --> 55:26.195
The boss has the document
classified as top secret until 2030.

55:26.215 --> 55:27.025
What?

55:27.065 --> 55:30.285
Apparently it contains everything
about Operation Clean Sweep.

55:30.585 --> 55:32.505
Even the 5th and final party.

55:32.535 --> 55:34.095
Everything?

55:34.115 --> 55:36.555
<i>I'm getting tired of this revenge.</i>

55:36.605 --> 55:40.965
To clear the name
of your dead father and my brother,

55:41.335 --> 55:45.615
you need that classified document.

55:45.655 --> 55:47.525
<i>The boss is out right now
meeting with someone.</i>

55:47.545 --> 55:51.245
I will buy you time, so hurry.

55:52.195 --> 55:54.015
It's in the safe at his place.

56:21.315 --> 56:22.665
What is it?

56:22.685 --> 56:25.025
The ignition won't start.

56:25.285 --> 56:27.725
I think I'll have to call
emergency assistance.

56:27.745 --> 56:30.525
Why won't the ignition start
all of a sudden?

57:08.005 --> 57:11.305
You intentionally pulled out the spark plug?

57:13.065 --> 57:17.025
You... wouldn't have...

57:29.535 --> 57:31.545
Shall we look at it together?

57:34.775 --> 57:37.985
Yoon Sung can't see it yet.

57:53.045 --> 57:55.505
What is it that you want to look at with me?

57:55.635 --> 58:00.605
If there is a classified document in there
that should be at the NIS,

58:00.735 --> 58:02.705
Lee Jin Pyo and Lee Yoon Sung...

58:02.725 --> 58:04.645
both of you will be arrested.

58:04.675 --> 58:06.475
What are you talking about?

58:06.705 --> 58:10.265
I came here looking for a contract
I signed with Steve Lee.

58:10.375 --> 58:12.835
I feel like it is disadvantageous to me.

58:12.875 --> 58:16.065
This is the last time you're going
to be able to try to slip out like that.

58:16.095 --> 58:19.685
Steve Lee, Lee Jin Pyo

58:19.735 --> 58:22.575
the lone survivor of Operation Clean Sweep.

58:23.115 --> 58:24.725
And Lee Yoon Sung,

58:24.745 --> 58:26.225
son of Park Moo Yul,

58:26.245 --> 58:28.985
who delivered Lee Kyung Wan
and Seo Yong Hak to me,

58:29.005 --> 58:32.555
who pushed Kim Jong Shik to attempt suicide,
the City Hunter.

58:33.055 --> 58:36.245
I'm pretty sure I told you
it wasn't entertaining

58:36.265 --> 58:37.915
to be cornered like this
without any evidence.

58:37.935 --> 58:39.515
Evidence?

58:40.335 --> 58:42.775
It's in that safe.

58:42.985 --> 58:45.515
The 2030 classified document...

58:46.265 --> 58:47.805
I told you, right?

58:47.825 --> 58:50.805
That I like to watch a rat trapped in a jar.

58:50.825 --> 58:52.515
So how is it?

58:53.015 --> 58:55.605
The feeling of being trapped in a jar?

58:59.885 --> 59:03.675
What the he** are you two
doing in my house?!

59:16.075 --> 59:19.295
There are two unwelcome guests
in the house.

59:19.825 --> 59:23.065
Is this what they call
breaking and entering?

59:23.655 --> 59:25.395
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo,

59:25.415 --> 59:27.645
I'm under the impression
you are currently on probation.

59:27.665 --> 59:30.445
Did you happen to bring
a search and seizure warrant?

59:33.295 --> 59:35.075
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung,

59:35.095 --> 59:39.445
was the deer farm investment meeting today?

59:39.485 --> 59:42.955
So, you plan to continue
the businessman and investor act?

59:43.085 --> 59:46.815
Why you two had to live
in the Golden Triangle,

59:47.235 --> 59:50.555
why you had to return under false names,

59:50.965 --> 59:53.515
I plan to expose right here and now.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.535
Good job...

01:00:24.805 --> 01:00:27.755
So, it was Steve Lee after all.

01:00:28.765 --> 01:00:33.435
I thought it was suspicious that he
approached me after the press conference.

01:00:35.085 --> 01:00:40.075
An expatriate agricultural business man
from the US...

01:00:41.935 --> 01:00:46.075
I got 300 billion won from him
for fooling me, so it's not a bad deal.

01:00:46.095 --> 01:00:48.425
Since he says he has 500 billion,

01:00:48.465 --> 01:00:51.255
we should take that
remaining 200 billion off his hands.

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:54.765
Investigate Steve Lee further.

01:00:54.785 --> 01:01:00.055
There is certainly some connection
with the dead Special Forces Unit.

01:01:00.095 --> 01:01:06.095
Or, like Kim Young Joo said,
he could be a survivor.

01:01:06.525 --> 01:01:07.655
I understand.

01:01:07.685 --> 01:01:10.505
If we're right about the City Hunter,

01:01:11.025 --> 01:01:14.725
then, he'll certainly return
to get this document.

01:01:15.135 --> 01:01:16.945
There are no others who know, right?

01:01:16.995 --> 01:01:18.305
I confirmed it.

01:01:18.325 --> 01:01:22.545
Kim Young Joo reported
the collapse of the NIS employee,

01:01:23.205 --> 01:01:25.435
but he died before the ambulance arrived.

01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:29.225
And what happened
with that thing I asked you to look into?

01:01:29.245 --> 01:01:32.885
I believe the woman named Lee Kyung Hee
left the country for the US.

01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:34.425
What?!

01:01:34.475 --> 01:01:37.575
Don't you think Steve Lee
might be behind this?

01:01:38.975 --> 01:01:44.435
Find out where Lee Kyung Hee is,
even if you have to search the entire US.

01:01:44.455 --> 01:01:45.845
Yes, Sir.

01:01:47.405 --> 01:01:50.275
Why are you suddenly looking for this woman?

01:01:51.565 --> 01:01:54.005
She's my final hidden card.

01:01:54.515 --> 01:01:58.785
Since nothing appears missing today,
I won't report you.

01:01:59.685 --> 01:02:00.485
In the future

01:02:00.486 --> 01:02:04.053
I'd appreciate it if you didn't come
into my house without permission,

01:02:04.265 --> 01:02:06.295
either of you.

01:02:06.915 --> 01:02:11.035
I really can't stand people
snooping into my private life.

01:02:30.995 --> 01:02:33.535
It's not like the document has legs
or anything. Who could have taken it?

01:02:33.565 --> 01:02:35.465
It's probably Chun Jae Man.

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:38.575
And he killed the NIS employee
who betrayed him.

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:41.395
I do want to know who the 5th party is too,

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.905
but more than that, I wanted to see with
my own eyes the record of the 1983 case,

01:02:43.965 --> 01:02:46.385
so this is unfortunate.

01:02:46.435 --> 01:02:47.695
Because of your real father?

01:02:47.735 --> 01:02:50.225
Mmm, I was curious.

01:02:50.655 --> 01:02:55.325
The situation faced by those people that
inevitably made them sacrifice my father...

01:02:55.645 --> 01:02:58.765
Oh, right... Do they sell frames
on the Home Shopping Channel?

01:02:58.795 --> 01:02:59.745
Of course.

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.835
Then, if a good one comes out,
get one for me.

01:03:01.855 --> 01:03:04.165
What's up with you,
telling me to actually buy something?

01:03:04.185 --> 01:03:07.355
Because of the monsoons a long time ago,
there aren't any pictures of my father left.

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:09.945
I'd like to copy the picture in the Security
Service album and frame it for her.

01:03:09.965 --> 01:03:15.705
Such a good son, good son, good son!
Okay, I'll buy the best one they've got!

01:03:15.735 --> 01:03:18.025
And don't you dare buy anything else.

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:23.895
Now even Chun Jae Man has entered my house.

01:03:26.635 --> 01:03:28.945
Everyone is taking me all too lightly.

01:03:28.985 --> 01:03:30.975
I'm sorry.

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:33.725
I never realized Chun Jae Man
would go so far...

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:37.915
Are you going to be able to continue
pretending to be a business man from the US?

01:03:37.965 --> 01:03:41.054
I suppose, he'll watch me suspiciously,
but still pretend to be fooled

01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:43.075
to get the remaining 200 billion won.

01:03:43.105 --> 01:03:45.245
What about the classified document?

01:03:45.475 --> 01:03:47.065
Are we just going to let it disappear
like this?

01:03:47.105 --> 01:03:51.265
It's better for it to disappear
than for Yoon Sung to know what's in it.

01:03:53.855 --> 01:03:57.855
Now, only the 5 of us need to forget.

01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.805
Are you looking for this?
