00:01.701 --> 00:03.328
<i>If you're normal,</i>

00:03.370 --> 00:07.204
<i>one of the few things</i>
<i>you can count on in life is death.</i>

00:12.812 --> 00:14.871
- Hello.
- <i>These are amazing.</i>

00:14.914 --> 00:18.145
They're all about the medicine.
There's no personal crap,

00:18.184 --> 00:21.642
no talk about boyfriends or feelings.
She hardly even mentions you.

00:21.688 --> 00:27.024
Thanks for pointing that out. What about
when she held the retractor six hours?

00:27.060 --> 00:30.257
<i>If you're a surgeon, even that</i>
<i>comfort is taken away from you.</i>

00:30.296 --> 00:33.754
- Like <i>Harry Potter</i> books I never had.
- Did you read the part

00:33.800 --> 00:37.736
where she did the pyloric stenosis
on the three-week-old baby?

00:42.475 --> 00:46.571
<i>Surgeons cheat death,</i>
<i>we prolong it, we deny it.</i>

00:49.582 --> 00:54.349
Hold on! He's in v-fib!
Charge to 300! Clear!

00:55.255 --> 00:57.849
Up to 360! Clear!

00:57.891 --> 01:01.156
<i>We stand and defiantly</i>
<i>give death the finger.</i>

01:01.194 --> 01:02.855
Good. Let's go.

01:07.867 --> 01:11.030
Grey, you're late.
She has Skills Lab.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.404
Good morning, Cristina.
It feels like minutes. See you later.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.638
No, Tucker, I did not say I won't
do the marriage counseling.

01:17.677 --> 01:22.046
I can't do it in the mornings again.
I'm now 20 minutes late for work.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.607
- I'll see you tonight.
- Marriage counseling?

01:24.651 --> 01:27.643
- How's that going?
- You heard us arguing about it.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.211
How you think it's going?

01:29.255 --> 01:33.248
You're doing a craniotomy on my patient
Rosemary Bullard today.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.591
Gonna be awake
or yawning into her brain?

01:35.628 --> 01:38.620
- Meredith kept me up.
- Don't need to hear your dirty...

01:38.665 --> 01:42.101
- Talking on the phone with Cristina.
- Aw, and stole your sleep?

01:42.135 --> 01:45.696
- Did you say, "Yang goes or I go"?
- I'm don't think I'd win that one.

01:45.738 --> 01:49.367
- Those two come as a set.
- Before, she had Burke. Burke helped.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.469
- True.
- Counseling's a good move.

01:52.512 --> 01:57.449
- Addison and I did counseling.
- Right before you got divorced?

01:57.484 --> 02:00.976
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce...

02:02.355 --> 02:04.084
...Stan.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.820
State-of-the-art
computerized patient simulator.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.521
Stan can educate you
in airway management,

02:09.562 --> 02:14.625
trauma assessment and care.
He breathes, he pulsates, he seizes,

02:14.667 --> 02:19.536
he hemorrhages, he secretes.
And he speaks. Hello, Stan.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.507
<i>Hello, doctor.</i>
<i>I'm not feeling well.</i>

02:22.542 --> 02:26.501
Stan will say what he needs.
He's more forgiving than most patients.

02:26.546 --> 02:31.643
You kill him, he'll keep coming back for
more. Make good use of him, people.

02:31.684 --> 02:34.482
- We're operating on robots?
- Can we go back to pigs?

02:34.521 --> 02:36.921
- What about people?
- When the chief decides who

02:36.956 --> 02:40.790
- gets the first solo surgery, be ready.
- Solo surgery?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.295
- When do we find out?
- Is he deciding soon?

02:43.329 --> 02:47.629
I do not know what it will be,
I do not know when it will be.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.693
I do know that the winner
should be prepared

02:50.737 --> 02:55.265
to do any surgical procedure, and
will choose one intern to scrub in.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.300
So practice your skills,
impress your attendings

02:58.344 --> 03:00.835
and do not make me look stupid.

03:00.880 --> 03:05.044
Grey, Stevens, you're with Hahn.
Yang, the pit. Karev and O'Malley,

03:05.084 --> 03:07.575
- you're Skills Lab. Get to know...
- Dibs!

03:07.620 --> 03:11.147
- Mine.
- <i>I am having chest pain.</i>

03:11.191 --> 03:14.627
Just to be clear, we are not
cracking open any chests today?

03:14.661 --> 03:18.893
- No, Stevens.
- With solo surgery coming up,

03:18.932 --> 03:21.059
we were hoping to be
on a cool surgical...

03:21.100 --> 03:24.797
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I don't get attached to patients.

03:24.837 --> 03:28.466
But I like this guy. I have spent almost
two years giving his family hope

03:28.508 --> 03:31.944
and then taking it away.
This procedure can buy him time

03:31.978 --> 03:35.345
until he gets another shot at
a transplant. Make sure it works.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.349
- Absolutely.
- Of course.

03:37.383 --> 03:41.114
- Familiar with the case?
- Michael Norris, 44-year old male

03:41.154 --> 03:44.248
with congenital hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy who has failed

03:44.290 --> 03:47.157
treatment at Seattle Pres.
Waiting on a transplant

03:47.193 --> 03:50.094
since narrowly missing out
on one on May 14th of 2000.

03:50.129 --> 03:53.030
- Wait. May 14th?
- What?

03:54.901 --> 03:58.803
- What?
- That's... That's Denny's heart.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.765
That's the heart I stole for Denny.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.210
I need you to have sex
with Cristina Yang.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.314
Good morning.

04:17.357 --> 04:21.088
Distract. Give her something
to do besides call my girlfriend

04:21.127 --> 04:24.062
- and wake me up.
- Yang. No.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.965
No. Too serious. Humorless.
Un-fun. Not my type.

04:28.001 --> 04:32.267
Yang should be your type.
She's intense, intelligent, complicated.

04:32.305 --> 04:36.332
She's like a single-malt Scotch.
And you are used to... beer bongs.

04:36.376 --> 04:40.403
- Callie Torres is no beer bong.
- Wait, I get it.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.538
You don't think you have a shot.
You're probably right.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.814
- Oh, I have a shot.
- Then try. As a favor to me.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.413
No. I'm not your stud horse.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.322
- You can't just tell me to...
- You slept with my wife.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.525
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.956
- Is that too tight?
- OK, yeah.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.298
- OK.
- Feels pretty good.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.902
- OK, good.
- Put one...

05:08.941 --> 05:11.705
Are you guys shooting drugs?
Oh, my God!

05:11.744 --> 05:14.975
- No, we're practicing IVs.
- How else are we supposed to learn?

05:15.014 --> 05:17.710
- Yang never lets us do anything.
- Practicing on each other?

05:17.750 --> 05:21.015
- We did it at Baylor, it's cool.
- No. It's not cool. It's crazy.

05:21.054 --> 05:25.218
- It's like creepy, basement crazy.
- Don't tell anyone!

05:25.258 --> 05:27.385
- Don't worry.
- I'm next.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.894
Hold still now.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.999
Ah, Dr. Hunt, got a second?

05:35.034 --> 05:37.264
It's about to get loud
in here, but shoot.

05:37.303 --> 05:42.741
We're awarding a solo surgery to a
second-year resident. I want your take.

05:42.775 --> 05:45.300
- One second.
- Unidentified male, mid-thirties.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.575
Lost vitals, shocked him
into sinus tach.

05:47.613 --> 05:50.605
- Possible fractures of both arms.
- OK, on three.

05:50.650 --> 05:55.314
- Two, three. Good, good.
- Open right tib <i>I</i> fib, rigid abdomen.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.789
- What doesn't he have?
- Found under an overpass.

05:57.824 --> 06:01.123
- Cops thinks someone threw him over.
- After they beat him to death?

06:01.160 --> 06:04.095
- So it's a contest, the solo surgery?
- You have fresh eyes.

06:04.130 --> 06:07.099
You don't know them personally,
you don't have any history,

06:07.133 --> 06:09.829
any relationship.
That perspective is rare here.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.201
I'll give it some thought.

06:12.238 --> 06:14.832
Dr. Webber, regarding the solo surgery,
I presume

06:14.874 --> 06:17.900
it's gonna be a general surgery?
I wanna be prepared...

06:17.944 --> 06:20.276
You'll know when you all know.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.838
And one more thing.
If my ER reports are right,

06:22.882 --> 06:25.476
you've been working three days.
When do you sleep?

06:25.518 --> 06:28.078
Keep tabs on all attendings?

06:28.121 --> 06:31.056
- His IV blew.
- Yang, he needs that access now!

06:31.090 --> 06:33.957
- I'm doing it.
- This will buy him some time

06:33.993 --> 06:36.359
- until you get that line in.
- Yeah.

06:37.196 --> 06:41.155
If you were less worried about winning
contests, you might have thought of it.

06:45.638 --> 06:50.473
So you're gonna give me
a heart attack? Literally?

06:51.611 --> 06:55.240
Uh... It's a technique called
"alcohol ablation."

06:55.281 --> 06:58.444
Through a catheter in your
femoral artery,

06:58.484 --> 07:01.647
Dr. Hahn will inject ethanol
straight into your heart.

07:01.687 --> 07:05.646
The alcohol will incinerate
any tissue cells it touches.

07:07.794 --> 07:11.662
- Dr. Stevens?
- Um...

07:11.697 --> 07:14.666
We're gonna be burning away
the muscle in your ventricle

07:14.700 --> 07:18.295
that's blocking your ability
to get oxygen.

07:18.337 --> 07:22.569
If we're successful,
you should feel immediate relief.

07:22.608 --> 07:26.339
Just like that?
I'll be able to breathe?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.779
- Just like that.
- And he can't be asleep

07:28.815 --> 07:30.976
- during the procedure?
- I'm afraid not.

07:31.017 --> 07:36.011
Dr. Stevens here will be asking you
to cough, inhale and exhale...

07:36.055 --> 07:40.424
- And checking to see if I'm dead yet?
- Mike, stop.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.727
- I mean, it is a heart attack, right?
- It's a dangerous procedure.

07:45.765 --> 07:50.202
But it's one we can monitor and control.
And if you don't have it,

07:50.236 --> 07:54.172
the next heart attack you have,
and you will have one...

07:54.207 --> 07:55.834
It'll kill me.

07:57.376 --> 08:02.370
Promise you'll keep me awake.
I... I don't want to miss this.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.215
I want Mike's latest echo and angio
before he goes to the cath lab.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.855
- Wow! Are you freaking out?
- What?

08:15.895 --> 08:19.956
- Why? Do you think I should be?
- This patient? In Denny's old room?

08:19.999 --> 08:24.265
- It's a lot of Denny for one day.
- It is a lot.

08:24.303 --> 08:28.501
A lot. Is it a lot
of Denny for you, too?

08:28.541 --> 08:31.942
I mean, how much Denny
are you experiencing?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.241
Iz, you can do this.

08:37.216 --> 08:41.982
- <i>My pain is getting worse.</i>
- I hate this.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.388
I'm not gonna win the solo surgery
practicing on Plastic Man.

08:45.424 --> 08:47.858
You're not gonna win because you suck.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.522
<i>Your bedside manner is what sucks.</i>

08:50.563 --> 08:54.499
- What? What did you say?
- Ain't technology amazing?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.594
Screw this. I'm gonna practice medicine.
You play with your doll.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.936
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>Scared of a little education?</i>

09:05.778 --> 09:09.578
You are so awesome!
You are so awesome!

09:09.615 --> 09:12.709
- <i>Ow.</i>
- No! No! No! No! Stan!

09:12.752 --> 09:15.277
What's a guy have to do
to get a beating this bad?

09:15.621 --> 09:17.851
Maybe he'll tell us
when he wakes up.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.687
Let's hope he makes it that long.

09:20.993 --> 09:24.326
Three, run these to the lab,
then go by the morgue and get the forms

09:24.363 --> 09:27.059
- for an unclaimed body.
- He's gonna need a chest tube.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.329
I was hoping,
with solo surgery coming up...

09:29.368 --> 09:32.769
With the solo surgery coming up,
your job is to impress me. So, go.

09:32.805 --> 09:36.468
Dr. Yang, with the solo surgery
coming up, your job is to impress me.

09:36.509 --> 09:40.275
- You're planning for his death.
- I was trying to be prepared. Sorry.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.406
I can't use sorry.
I could use a doctor.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.207
Be one.

09:45.785 --> 09:49.778
The kind of metastases you have
are prone to spontaneous bleeding.

09:49.822 --> 09:54.225
So there are considerable risks
to the surgery.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.524
- You're saying this one...
- Might be dicier.

09:56.562 --> 09:59.429
Much dicier than previous surgeries.

09:59.465 --> 10:03.094
I want to be clear, you can live
with this. For months, if not longer.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.000
Not... Not like this.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.904
Not feeling this bad.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.676
I understand risks
are part of the package.

10:12.712 --> 10:16.773
That's why you people make me go
cross-eyed signing all these forms.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.148
You're signing
a "Do Not Resuscitate" order?

10:19.185 --> 10:20.516
If it's my time to go...

10:20.553 --> 10:23.954
She doesn't want to be on life-support
kind of thing. She'd hate that.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.015
I just hate lying around like that.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.355
I don't want that.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.456
OK.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.663
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, love.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.184
Sorry. We do this every time.

10:54.220 --> 10:57.815
She signs the paper, we kiss goodbye.

10:57.857 --> 11:01.793
Then after the surgery,
we say hello again.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.727
That sounds like a plan to me.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.665
You rest up.
We'll be bringing you up soon.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.334
That there is
the Holy Grail of marriage.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.202
Something to aspire to.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.238
- What happens to them?
- You sign, attending signs,

11:18.277 --> 11:21.678
- pink copy goes in his chart.
- No, I mean the bodies.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.909
The unclaimed bodies.
What happens to them?

11:23.949 --> 11:26.679
If they remained unclaimed for
a certain time, they're cremated,

11:26.719 --> 11:29.347
- the ones that haven't been preserved.
- Preserved?

11:29.388 --> 11:31.356
For medical research, gross anatomy,

11:31.390 --> 11:35.724
- surgical study, that sort of thing.
- For, like, med students?

11:35.761 --> 11:38.321
Exactly. For med students.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.855
To practice on?

11:42.234 --> 11:44.031
You're pretty.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.141
Um...

11:52.845 --> 11:56.941
Thank you all for being here.
I appreciate the opportunity to learn

11:56.982 --> 11:58.973
and I'm sorry you had to die.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.680
Oh! Uh... Instrument trays!

12:01.721 --> 12:04.747
- We got a rhythm.
- We got to get him up to surgery.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.884
- He's bleeding through his leg splint.
- So the chief has asked me

12:07.927 --> 12:10.225
to watch the second years
for the solo surgery.

12:10.262 --> 12:13.026
- What's your take, as a class?
- They're a mixed bag.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.862
Yang's very good.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.768
She's... hardcore.
She'll be a cardio god.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.738
- She's my roommate.
- And Stevens?

12:20.773 --> 12:24.209
She's smart. Good with patients,
very compassionate, supposedly.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.973
She did sleep with my ex-husband
while we were married.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.947
I'm more interested
in the doctor part.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.678
Right. Obviously.
Of course you are.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.812
New scans, good.

12:37.857 --> 12:42.351
- Splenic subcapsular hematoma...
- I can look. Go update his chart.

12:48.067 --> 12:51.559
- Dr. Yang, you paged me?
- Patient in Trauma One.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.301
You paged me for a consult?
I was hoping you wanted to see me.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.742
I did. The patient has a shattered
nose and cheekbones

12:58.778 --> 13:01.542
and a fractured left mandible.
Trauma One.

13:07.419 --> 13:10.547
OK, Mike, the catheters are in.
It's time to inject.

13:10.589 --> 13:14.491
OK, just hold tight.
Stevens, over here, please.

13:14.527 --> 13:19.362
I specifically chose you for this case
because you connect well with patients.

13:19.398 --> 13:22.959
That's something
I've been told to work on not doing.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.936
Mike needs you talking to him.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.734
He's scared,
his pulse is elevating, step up.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.070
OK.

13:31.777 --> 13:35.645
Hey, Mike, you're doing great.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.149
You're gonna feel a little
bit of burning.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.446
Will that make it...?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.981
There it is. Oh, God!

13:47.026 --> 13:50.757
- Try not to move.
- Try to lay still. Try to breathe.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.497
- Make it stop!
- Mike, we can't stop

13:55.534 --> 13:58.662
but it's gonna end soon.
Hang in there. Stevens, talk to him.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.229
- I'm sorry.
- Grey, how's his pressure?

14:01.273 --> 14:03.298
Eighty-five systolic.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.970
Stevens, talk! Help him!

14:06.912 --> 14:10.245
Stevens, get him to cough.
Get him to breathe.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.910
- Stevens!
- Pressure's stabilizing.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.977
OK, how you doing, Mike?

14:19.158 --> 14:22.889
I still... can't breathe.

14:22.928 --> 14:25.362
Does that mean we're not successful?

14:25.397 --> 14:28.696
There were two arterial routes
I could choose.

14:28.734 --> 14:32.101
- The next time we do this...
- No. I can't...

14:32.137 --> 14:37.006
I won't do this again.
Please, I can't do this again.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.943
I'm sorry.

14:39.979 --> 14:41.708
I'm so sorry.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.918
Tell Stevens to find me so I can
permanently throw her off my service.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.586
Dr. Hahn, I know you have
a history with this patient.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.962
- In a weird way, Izzie does, too.
- A history? With my patient?

14:59.999 --> 15:02.934
No, with Denny Duquette.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.369
Tell her to find me.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.976
The tumor's position has been altered.

15:13.012 --> 15:16.072
I need an ultrasound localization.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.242
I took care of the Yang problem,
by the way.

15:18.284 --> 15:22.414
Already? That sounds too easy.

15:22.454 --> 15:25.617
If it doesn't feel like work,
it's not going to work.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.149
Where did you learn that?
Marriage counseling?

15:28.193 --> 15:29.558
Of course not.

15:29.595 --> 15:34.191
It's a complete waste of time.
This couple, the Bullards,

15:34.233 --> 15:39.330
I bet they never got counseling.
They just take the bad with the good.

15:39.371 --> 15:43.068
Damn it. Tumor's hemorrhaging.
Her brain's starting to swell.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.906
- Push 70 of mannitol!
- She's bradying down.

15:45.945 --> 15:51.076
One of atropine. Let's make sure these
two get a chance to say hello again.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.657
- Have you seen Izzie?
- No.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.820
You got anything I can scrub in on?
Robo-patient sucks.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.989
Listen, Izzie is having a rough day.
So if you see her...

16:06.031 --> 16:08.795
- No, I'm having a rough day.
- What happened?

16:08.834 --> 16:11.325
Hunt. Hunt hates me. He hates me!

16:11.370 --> 16:13.770
- He kissed you.
- Yes.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.900
That was... before.
Now, he hates my guts.

16:16.942 --> 16:19.775
This is worse than Hahn.
I have no idea what I did

16:19.812 --> 16:22.440
or said or what?

16:22.481 --> 16:24.176
I gotta get off this case.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.518
Ah! Dr. Yang.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.921
Our guy scheduled for surgery?
I want to know when

16:30.956 --> 16:32.947
- I'm gonna see you next?
- He's not stable.

16:32.992 --> 16:37.122
- Oh! Then we might have time to...
- I've just been paged down.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.995
This does not happen to me.

16:40.032 --> 16:43.160
Bow to me,
for I am the queen of the interns.

16:43.202 --> 16:46.399
I have assembled an army of the dead
to teach us things.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.464
Cadavers. I got us cadavers
to practice on. A whole bunch.

16:49.508 --> 16:53.945
- You got cadavers? Human cadavers?
- In the tunnels. Meet there for lunch.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:03.922 --> 17:07.323
Let me ask you something.
Do you know if Izzie Stevens

17:07.358 --> 17:10.328
had some sort of a relationship
with Denny Duquette?

17:13.298 --> 17:16.926
You mean, besides the engagement?
And the cutting his LVAD wire

17:16.969 --> 17:19.665
so she could move him
up the transplant list?

17:19.704 --> 17:24.699
Izzie was on probationary leave. She
was nearly kicked out of the program.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.439
- I forget you weren't here then.
- No, I wasn't.

17:27.479 --> 17:30.812
I was at another hospital,
watching my patient's heart get stolen

17:30.849 --> 17:32.282
out of his chest.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.654
Did you page me down here for sex?
Because I'm not really in the mood.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.784
- Want to see some dead guys?
- Why?

17:41.827 --> 17:44.352
- Come on.
- Why would you say that? Why?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.591
Cadavers.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.294
- For practice. For solo surgery.
- What is this?

17:49.334 --> 17:53.202
I heard you were having a crappy day.
I thought this would cheer you up.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.211
- What?
- It's like a bouquet.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.406
Of corpses. That is so...

18:02.448 --> 18:06.282
I'm sorry. No.
That's crazy. He's dead.

18:06.318 --> 18:09.617
He's dead.
Just so many dead people today.

18:14.059 --> 18:18.086
- These are for interns!
- Go play with the dummy!

18:19.932 --> 18:22.765
- Come on!
- <i>I cannot help it.</i>

18:22.801 --> 18:25.827
- <i>I'm dying.</i>
- But I'm applying pressure!

18:25.871 --> 18:28.169
<i>Must be something you're forgetting.</i>

18:28.207 --> 18:31.199
- For crying out loud!
- <i>I'm surprised you even passed</i>

18:31.243 --> 18:33.837
- <i>your intern exam.</i>
- Oh, my God!

18:38.117 --> 18:40.779
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.749
- Chief, I have to talk to you.
- Hey, Hahn, come in.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.923
I want you to watch this.
Let's blow an artery.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.491
I'm bleeding out!
I'm bleeding out.

18:55.534 --> 18:59.664
It's about Izzie Stevens
and Denny Duquette.

19:01.507 --> 19:05.671
How is Stevens still working here?
How is Seattle Grace still accredited?

19:05.711 --> 19:09.306
This thing goes unreported?
No wonder this place is number 12!

19:09.348 --> 19:13.785
- Stop right there.
- I want an ethics panel assembled.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.346
I want Stevens's role in this
investigated and Bailey's as well.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.254
- She was her superior...
- Slow!

19:19.291 --> 19:22.158
No! My patient lost a heart over this.

19:22.194 --> 19:26.528
- Someone is gonna lose their job!
- Stop! We are not digging this up.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.932
It didn't go unreported.
It was reported to me. I dealt with it.

19:29.968 --> 19:33.597
Stevens was punished.
She's learned and she's on her way

19:33.639 --> 19:37.735
to becoming an excellent surgeon.
That's the kind of hospital I'm running.

19:37.776 --> 19:41.735
This issue has been laid to rest.
It's in the past, that's where it stays.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.248
It's not in the past for me!

19:44.283 --> 19:47.377
It's lying on a bed in the ICU,
about to die!

19:47.419 --> 19:50.980
Then your only responsibility
is to make sure that doesn't happen.

20:03.302 --> 20:06.328
It was a difficult surgery,
especially at her age.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.534
We're not sure how
she's going to respond.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.975
Oh, sure.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.873
The waiting is always the hard part.

20:20.252 --> 20:23.312
- Ed, she might not make it.
- I know.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.050
I know.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.041
Iz.

20:52.150 --> 20:56.712
- You're hiding from Hahn?
- Sure. Her, too.

20:56.755 --> 21:00.384
- Is Mike OK?
- No. The ablation failed.

21:00.425 --> 21:04.828
He's refusing to try again,
so Hahn's... Um...

21:04.863 --> 21:08.993
- You should go talk to her.
- I stole his heart, Meredith.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.400
I stole it for Denny.
I stole it for myself.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.769
And now I'm supposed to hold his hand
while we torture him?

21:14.806 --> 21:18.503
I can't even look at him.
It's my fault that he's here.

21:22.147 --> 21:25.674
So, anyway, I'm hiding.

21:32.157 --> 21:35.149
Yang, suction here, please.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.989
Sloan's coming in
for the mandibular repair?

21:41.800 --> 21:45.497
Sorry about before. Everybody's up
in everybody else's business here.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.472
Better to keep things
professional, if you can.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.067
Yes. One minute
you're working with people,

21:51.109 --> 21:54.169
then you're friends with them
and then... whatever.

21:54.212 --> 21:57.739
Suddenly there's all this pressure
to define what you are,

21:57.783 --> 22:00.809
like it's all black and white.
You are this or you're that.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.343
You are aware you're doing it again,
right?

22:03.388 --> 22:07.654
- Dr. Hunt? How's our mystery man?
- Still with us. He's a fighter.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.888
Hate to be the other guy. Callie.

22:11.763 --> 22:14.630
Dr. Yang, I know cracking chests
is more your thing,

22:14.666 --> 22:18.762
but you'd be surprised how exciting it
can be when I manipulate a little skin.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.398
Actually, Dr. Yang,
why don't you scrub out.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.374
We've got enough hands in here.

22:23.408 --> 22:24.568
OK.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.610
Hey, I heard he went up.
Can I scrub in?

22:28.647 --> 22:33.016
Shut it. If I'm not in, you're not in.
You stink.

22:33.051 --> 22:35.383
- I showered.
- You smell like formaldehyde.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.513
You smell like death.

22:37.556 --> 22:39.387
Why do you smell like death?

22:40.125 --> 22:41.217
Uh...

22:43.161 --> 22:44.719
I see dead people!

22:46.531 --> 22:48.089
- Get out.
- I need off Hunt case.

22:48.133 --> 22:52.035
In a one-time offer, I'll trade
my beaten-to-a-pulp trauma-palooza

22:52.070 --> 22:57.565
of a patient for no less than
three of your cadavers. Pony up.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.600
Deal. Take three.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.576
I need to be with people.

23:05.617 --> 23:08.484
Preferably live people, but whatever.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.822
Alex, by the way, thank you for bringing
me the corpses. It was very sweet.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.096
Dr. Hunt and Dr. Sloan
are still operating.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.689
- Could I try...?
- No!

23:20.732 --> 23:24.293
my dead mommy taught
me a cool way to hold instruments.

23:24.736 --> 23:28.331
If you palm it,
you can switch off faster.

23:28.373 --> 23:32.332
When your dead mommy teaches
you things, can you see her?

23:32.377 --> 23:37.212
- No. I'm reading her journals.
- Duh, I was kidding. Obviously.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.582
I did see her once, though.
And that bomb squad guy.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.417
And Denny.

23:44.489 --> 23:49.153
- Today?
- No. I was dead at the time.

23:50.362 --> 23:54.298
- I feel my mom with me sometimes.
- I got to get off this case.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.136
- Could I...?
- No!

24:01.173 --> 24:04.472
Please don't be in there,
please don't be in there.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.909
Please don't be in there.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.052
Dr. Hahn, I came to apologize

24:22.093 --> 24:25.654
and ask if I could please
be let off your service.

24:25.697 --> 24:29.861
No. If I can convince Mike
to have another ablation,

24:29.901 --> 24:32.631
you're gonna be there
to see him through it,

24:32.671 --> 24:34.605
to look him in the eye,

24:34.639 --> 24:38.541
to help him through the pain
that you have caused him.

24:38.577 --> 24:42.343
If he dies, I want you there for that
too, because you're responsible.

24:42.380 --> 24:46.214
He decided.
He won't do another procedure.

24:46.251 --> 24:50.745
I'm going to... go check him out.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.926
Dr. Stevens.

25:01.366 --> 25:06.030
She'll be OK. This has...

25:06.071 --> 25:08.471
This has been coming for a long time.

25:09.941 --> 25:14.037
She'll be OK. She'll...
She'll move on.

25:16.114 --> 25:19.083
If you die,

25:19.117 --> 25:21.585
she will not get over it.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.747
She will not move on.

25:23.788 --> 25:26.382
She'll think she can.
She'll even think she has.

25:26.424 --> 25:29.257
And out of the blue,
you'll be right there with her,

25:29.294 --> 25:32.957
so close she'll think she can touch you,
and then all of this

25:32.998 --> 25:35.796
will just...

25:35.834 --> 25:38.769
...be happening for her all over again.

25:39.604 --> 25:42.334
She will not be able to move on.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.647
They're not doing anything.
Make them do something!

25:51.683 --> 25:55.084
- They're standing around!
- They're keeping her comfortable.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.918
That's all they can do.
You and Rosie agreed,

25:57.956 --> 26:03.053
there would be no extreme measures taken
if her time came. Her time is here.

26:03.094 --> 26:05.756
- What's going on?
- She's coding.

26:05.797 --> 26:09.096
And Mr. Bullard is reconsidering
the DNR order.

26:09.134 --> 26:12.729
Ed, this was what I warned you about.
This moment.

26:12.771 --> 26:17.140
Even if we try to resuscitate her,
I'm not sure she'll wake up again.

26:17.175 --> 26:19.871
Nothing more we can do.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.477
Rosie.

26:34.392 --> 26:37.725
Rosie? Hon?

26:40.332 --> 26:42.129
Rosie.

26:45.303 --> 26:46.930
No.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.341
Stay with me, Rosie.

26:56.381 --> 26:59.839
Rosie? Stay with me.

26:59.884 --> 27:05.322
Don't leave me, Rosie.
Stay with me, Rosie. Don't leave me.

27:05.357 --> 27:08.349
Stay with me. Stay with me, Rosie!

27:08.393 --> 27:11.851
Stay with me. Come back, Rosie!
Don't leave me.

27:11.896 --> 27:14.763
Stay with me.
Don't leave me.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.267
Stay with me, Rosie.
Stay with me.

27:19.070 --> 27:22.369
Stay with me. Don't leave me.

27:22.407 --> 27:26.173
Stay with me, Rosie.
Don't leave me.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.873
Stay with me. Don't leave me.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.574
Stay with me, Rosie.

27:30.615 --> 27:32.173
Please, Rosie. No!

27:32.217 --> 27:34.117
- Please don't...
- Mr. Bullard.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.983
Do something for her!
Do something!

27:36.021 --> 27:37.955
- Mr. Bullard
- No! No!

27:37.989 --> 27:42.517
- Let him be. Let him be.
- Please, Rosie.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.357
Please.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.563
I'm glad you decided to try again.

27:50.602 --> 27:55.198
You can thank Dr. Stevens.
It's her fault we're here, right?

27:55.240 --> 27:58.038
Vitals are stable,
he's ready for the injection.

27:58.076 --> 28:02.740
- The alcohol is going in.
- No, wait. Wait, don't.

28:02.781 --> 28:05.978
Mike, look at me.
Just stay with me.

28:06.017 --> 28:10.078
It's going to hurt, but not as much
as you think it's going to.

28:14.325 --> 28:18.022
He's in SVT. There may be alcohol
backing into his AV node.

28:18.063 --> 28:22.227
- Get him to cough, get him to breathe.
- You need to breathe. Cough for me.

28:22.267 --> 28:25.361
Look at me, Mike. Look at me!

28:35.647 --> 28:38.138
He's in V-tach, losing consciousness.

28:38.183 --> 28:41.846
Push 100 of lidocaine. Ready.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.093
Oh, man. It's Lexie.

28:51.796 --> 28:55.732
I gotta go.
Beaten-to-a-pulp Guy is coding.

28:55.767 --> 28:59.328
Oh, no. Pulp Guy is mine.
We traded!

29:00.772 --> 29:03.969
- Why didn't you put in a chest tube?
- I don't know how.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.806
What do you mean?
I learned that my first week.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.177
Yes, you learned.
You know, but I'll never know

29:09.214 --> 29:10.909
because you won't let me try one,

29:10.949 --> 29:13.782
but you hog all our robots
and you steal all our corpses!

29:14.619 --> 29:20.251
Dude, I think you broke her.
Vitals are stable, for now.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.782
Was there this much blood
in his urine before?

29:22.827 --> 29:23.953
No.

29:23.995 --> 29:26.691
- Bedside cystogram.
- Dibs on that.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.926
It's mine.
His bladder repair is mine, too.

29:28.967 --> 29:31.435
- We traded, I get his bladder.
- We never traded.

29:31.469 --> 29:34.632
To prove you wrong, next time
he crashes, you put in his chest tube.

29:34.672 --> 29:37.732
Get away from that man right now!

29:39.110 --> 29:41.305
He was crashing,
so we upped his dopamine...

29:41.346 --> 29:43.780
Are you deaf, Karev?
I said step away from him.

29:43.815 --> 29:47.148
- We were saving his life...
- What you did was pick him over

29:47.185 --> 29:50.586
like vultures, like a bunch
of children fighting over toys.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.090
You treat a man fighting
to live as if he was dead.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.582
You have no sense,
no decency and no respect!

30:00.131 --> 30:02.793
Just get out. Just get out of here.

30:30.028 --> 30:31.655
Ed.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.325
Rosemary's gone.

30:35.366 --> 30:39.200
Her heart is no longer
beating on its own.

30:39.237 --> 30:44.766
The second you stop doing
what you're doing, it will stop.

30:44.809 --> 30:49.041
I... I can't be the one
to let her go.

30:50.248 --> 30:54.708
- To let her die.
- I know.

30:55.453 --> 30:58.183
I know you can't.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.857
OK.

31:11.502 --> 31:15.529
Here you go. Sit down. Sit down.
There you go.

31:34.525 --> 31:35.958
Dr. Bailey.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.262
All right, let's get
the crash cart in here!

31:50.875 --> 31:54.709
Mike! Open your eyes!

31:54.746 --> 31:56.304
Just stay here with me!

31:56.347 --> 32:00.613
I need you to fight, Mike,
fight to stay with Elyse.

32:00.652 --> 32:04.554
You have to live through this.
You need to breathe right now.

32:04.589 --> 32:09.123
Right now!

32:24.776 --> 32:26.937
Are you OK?

32:52.670 --> 32:56.970
You don't have to do it.
Let me. Let me.

33:25.503 --> 33:29.963
Dr. Yang, I'll need you
to bring me the post-op report

33:30.008 --> 33:32.169
on our beating victim
before you leave.

33:32.210 --> 33:35.839
I'm sorry, did you say something?

33:37.248 --> 33:40.240
- Yang, what is wrong with you?
- Sir?

33:40.284 --> 33:44.186
I have had women opt for needless
elective buttock enhancement surgery

33:44.222 --> 33:48.420
just for another chance to be flirted
with by me. So, what's your deal?

33:49.227 --> 33:52.162
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:53.197 --> 33:56.098
I have been hitting on you all day!

33:57.602 --> 33:59.399
Oh... I...

33:59.437 --> 34:01.530
Really? Oh...

34:03.074 --> 34:05.907
Excuse me.

34:05.943 --> 34:10.539
It was a stupid idea! It wasn't
even my idea. It was Shepherd's idea.

34:10.581 --> 34:14.210
- Oh, come on.
- That woman is not single-malt Scotch.

34:14.252 --> 34:18.916
She is bad, cheap wine that gives you
a headache you can feel in your teeth.

34:23.928 --> 34:26.726
Dr. Hunt. Any thoughts
on the second-years after today?

34:26.764 --> 34:32.031
- It's only been a day, sir.
- Of course.

34:32.070 --> 34:36.097
They're undisciplined, inarticulate and
they have a lot to learn about respect.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.665
Mostly, they're more interested
in personal crap.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.610
I'm not sure they're being
taught anything different.

34:41.646 --> 34:45.275
Honestly, I'm not sure
I'll be staying on. Excuse me, sir.

34:52.290 --> 34:55.157
Tell me I am not seeing
what I'm seeing.

34:55.193 --> 34:58.924
Tell me I am not seeing a room full

34:58.963 --> 35:02.455
of human bodies half-open,

35:02.500 --> 35:05.594
- scattered and forgotten about.
- They're unclaimed bodies.

35:05.636 --> 35:07.570
Unclaimed.

35:07.605 --> 35:12.042
Each one of these people was loved.

35:12.076 --> 35:16.740
Each one of these people
was somebody's somebody.

35:16.781 --> 35:20.683
So we are responsible
for treating them as such.

35:20.718 --> 35:25.712
We claim them and treat them
with respect!

35:28.793 --> 35:32.092
Close them up, cover them up

35:32.130 --> 35:35.099
and put them back where they belong.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.862
Now!

35:48.946 --> 35:51.972
The wife's here of the beating victim.
She ID'd her husband.

35:52.016 --> 35:53.847
What's his name?

35:53.885 --> 35:58.822
I wondered if you asked his name so
that he could become a person to you.

35:58.856 --> 36:01.791
They're all people.
This is not a game or a contest

36:01.826 --> 36:04.727
or a competition to see who
gets surgery and who doesn't.

36:04.762 --> 36:08.823
They're people, and we get to save them.
Now, you're good. You're excellent.

36:08.866 --> 36:12.734
You can win all the contests. If that's
why you're doing this, you shouldn't be.

36:13.971 --> 36:16.201
Did you find out his name?

36:31.789 --> 36:34.849
My dad died when I was nine
in a car accident.

36:34.892 --> 36:38.191
I was with him in the car.
While we waited for the ambulance,

36:38.229 --> 36:41.995
I tried to keep his chest closed
so he wouldn't bleed so much.

36:43.334 --> 36:46.303
When he died...

36:48.639 --> 36:52.905
...my hands felt his heart stop beating.

36:55.479 --> 36:57.538
That's why I do this.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.908
It's also why I win all the contests.

37:04.755 --> 37:08.054
The patient's name is Tom.

37:16.934 --> 37:19.494
Single-malt Scotch.

37:23.874 --> 37:27.310
<i>We're born, we live, we die.</i>

37:27.345 --> 37:31.372
<i>Sometimes, not necessarily</i>
<i>in that order.</i>

37:33.284 --> 37:35.275
Clear!

37:38.422 --> 37:43.450
- Yes! You don't get to die!
- Nice job.

37:43.494 --> 37:46.622
Oh, hi. Thanks. I, uh...

37:47.732 --> 37:50.496
You know, he's just a robot.

37:52.303 --> 37:56.103
I want to take back
what I said before about leaving.

37:56.140 --> 37:59.200
I was overreacting. I was just...

37:59.243 --> 38:02.610
It was personal. I wondered
if you could forget about it?

38:02.647 --> 38:07.050
<i>Get some sleep, Dr. Hunt.</i>
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

38:18.229 --> 38:21.790
- <i>Chief?</i>
- Good save, O'Malley.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.225
Thank you.

38:25.269 --> 38:27.100
<i>We put things to rest...</i>

38:30.074 --> 38:32.565
<i>...only to have them rise up again.</i>

38:32.610 --> 38:35.545
I'm in.

38:44.422 --> 38:47.448
"So, I ended my day
with a segmental colectomy."

38:47.491 --> 38:49.652
Oh, badass!

38:49.694 --> 38:51.321
Oh...

38:51.362 --> 38:54.456
Sloan? Seriously?

38:54.732 --> 38:56.859
Did you think we would double-date?

38:56.901 --> 38:59.267
I'm gonna take my pants off,
if you want to see...

38:59.303 --> 39:00.463
Nope.

39:02.473 --> 39:05.033
I'll see it later.
I'm gonna go downstairs.

39:05.076 --> 39:10.173
<i>So if death is not the end,</i>
<i>what can you count on anymore?</i>

39:10.214 --> 39:12.705
So how's your patient doing?

39:12.750 --> 39:15.514
Well, he still needs a heart,
but I bought him some time.

39:15.553 --> 39:19.319
- Good, I'm glad.
- I went to the chief about Izzie

39:19.357 --> 39:21.484
and he completely shut me down.

39:21.525 --> 39:24.050
We'll see what he says
when I report this to UNOS.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.325
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, why?

39:26.364 --> 39:28.355
What good would come of that?

39:28.399 --> 39:31.334
- What do you mean?
- What possible good would it do?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.234
Benefit your patient's outcome?

39:33.270 --> 39:36.068
My patient wouldn't be here,
if it wasn't for her.

39:36.107 --> 39:40.874
Your gonna report to UNOS and cost this
hospital its transplant certification?

39:40.911 --> 39:43.471
Cost our patients organs,
cost people their jobs,

39:43.514 --> 39:47.348
- cost Izzie Stevens her career?
- You're taking Izzie's side in this?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.910
- Over mine?
- She's a doctor, one of our doctors.

39:49.954 --> 39:52.787
There's a reason
we have each other's backs.

39:52.823 --> 39:55.383
Do not talk to me about a code.
This is not that.

39:55.426 --> 39:58.486
No, this is that.
I don't know what happened

39:58.529 --> 40:02.431
between Denny and Izzie. Unless you
were in the middle of that situation,

40:02.466 --> 40:06.300
- I don't see how you make a judgment.
- Easy. There's right and wrong.

40:06.337 --> 40:09.704
And this was wrong. And illegal.

40:09.740 --> 40:14.973
There is no gray area here.
You can't kind of think this is OK.

40:15.012 --> 40:18.175
You can't kind of side
with Izzie Stevens.

40:18.215 --> 40:21.184
And you can't kind of be a lesbian.

40:24.455 --> 40:26.082
Yes, I can.

40:26.123 --> 40:29.149
<i>Because you sure can't count</i>
<i>on anything in life.</i>

40:29.193 --> 40:31.718
- I can't believe I didn't know.
- The chief is right.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.060
No, you.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.362
I don't know you at all.

40:40.771 --> 40:45.765
<i>Life is the most fragile, unstable,</i>
<i>unpredictable thing there is.</i>

41:06.864 --> 41:10.493
No... No.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.836
You can't be here.

41:14.872 --> 41:17.898
I have to move on.

41:19.176 --> 41:23.636
I love you, and I will always love you,
but I have to move on.

41:23.681 --> 41:28.516
That's why I had that patient today
and that's why I helped save his life.

41:28.552 --> 41:33.512
So I wouldn't feel guilty anymore,
and I can move on. So, please...

41:33.557 --> 41:37.687
- ...you have to go.
- Go where?

41:39.196 --> 41:42.893
- Are you OK?
- Yes. Yes.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.231
I am totally OK.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.737
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

41:48.439 --> 41:51.408
I have to change but
I'll meet you at the bar, OK?

41:51.442 --> 41:52.704
OK.

41:55.312 --> 41:59.976
<i>In fact, there's only one</i>
<i>thing about life we can be sure of.</i>

42:07.424 --> 42:09.984
Are you sure you're OK?

42:17.234 --> 42:19.964
<i>It ain't over, till it's over.</i>
