ADULT ADAM: Ah, the '90s.
The decade of the TV spin-off.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.307
Hercules gave us Xena.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.309
Buffy gave us Angel.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.710
And The Golden Girls
gave us...

00:09.743 --> 00:12.180
The exact same show
without Bea Arthur.

00:12.213 --> 00:16.984
The '80s were my decade,
my story, my glory days.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.253
But that wasn't the case
for Lainey Lewis.

00:19.287 --> 00:22.356
LAINEY: Back then,
my romance with Barry Goldberg
was legendary,

00:22.390 --> 00:24.425
but in the end,
it wasn't meant to be.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.594
Yep, my story
was just beginning.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.028
I was driven to leave
our small town,

00:28.062 --> 00:30.498
destined to become the biggest
rock star in the world.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.466
Hello, Austin!

00:33.501 --> 00:35.803
...Fletcher's
eighth birthday party.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.205
You're a big boy now,
Austin.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.973
Like most music careers,
mine started at the bottom.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.042
But I did have
some brushes with greatness.

00:42.076 --> 00:45.113
* I want my baby back
* Chili's baby back ribs

00:45.146 --> 00:46.614
* Barbecue sauce

00:46.647 --> 00:47.981
Now, uh, let's hear it
with just the guys.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.217
MEN:
* I want my baby back... *

00:49.250 --> 00:50.484
LAINEY: But years
of coming up short

00:50.518 --> 00:52.019
couldn't satisfy
my rock 'n' roll dreams.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.488
(LINE RINGING)
Or my mounting debt
and anxious dad.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.457
(MODEM BEEPING)
I had to face reality
and find a real job.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.992
You need to face reality
and find a real job!

00:59.026 --> 01:00.461
Yes, Daddy.
I'm well aware.
(MOUSE CLICKING)

01:00.494 --> 01:03.197
And then, with the help
of '90s Internet technology,

01:03.231 --> 01:07.701
the perfect fallback job,
the answer to all my problems
appeared before my eyes.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.238
Every fiber of my being
pointed to "Yes."

01:10.271 --> 01:11.872
No.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.374
But I'd be a great
choral teacher.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.344
I love music. I work well
with children probably.

01:16.377 --> 01:20.914
The only drawback is that
you have no experience
or knowledge or references.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.883
Actually, I do have
one reference.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.819
That's not nearly enough.
Hello, Jonathan.

01:25.853 --> 01:26.920
Oh, (BLEEP) me!

01:26.954 --> 01:29.423
This girl is an angel
from Heaven,

01:29.457 --> 01:30.991
and if you don't
hire her right now,

01:31.024 --> 01:33.093
I'm just gonna have to show up
here every day until you do.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.429
Welcome aboard.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.730
Oh! (LAUGHS)

01:37.965 --> 01:39.900

01:39.933 --> 01:41.769
(TIRES SQUEAL, SCREECH)

01:41.802 --> 01:43.571
LAINEY: Yep, I was back
in my old school,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.105
but as a teacher...

01:45.139 --> 01:47.107
A teacher who overslept
on her first day.

01:47.141 --> 01:50.578
Exactly like I did
every day I went there.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.446
Oh, son of a...

01:52.480 --> 01:54.782
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Lainey Lewis.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.517
Hey, Coach.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.785
You're looking...

01:57.818 --> 01:59.187
Weirdly,
exactly the same.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.688
You're late,
smartmouth.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.889
Throw on
some gym clothes

02:01.922 --> 02:03.924
and get into right field
with Sanjeev.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.693
Yeah, I was a student here
years ago.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.195
I'm the new
music teacher.

02:07.228 --> 02:10.364
You?
But you're a troublemaker
and a slacker.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.401
A lot has changed,
and I am an adult now.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.802
You're wearing
two different shoes.

02:14.835 --> 02:15.903
Shut up, nerd!

02:17.004 --> 02:19.540
No, not nerd.
Uh, valued student.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.641
Way to cover.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.576
Welcome back,
Lainey Lewis.

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

02:36.357 --> 02:38.759
LAINEY: It was January 9th,
1990-something,

02:38.792 --> 02:40.761
and even though I was off
to a rough start,

02:40.794 --> 02:43.831
I was ready to prove
I was an adult,
a real teacher.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.667
Oh! No students
in the teachers lounge.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.168
This is where we talk
and show emotions.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.638
Again, not a student.
We just went
over this outside.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.905
Ah. Muscle memory.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.140
You know,
every time I see you,

02:53.173 --> 02:55.142
my first instinct
is to give you detention.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.278
Well, can you stop?
Oh, like all my muscles,

02:57.311 --> 02:59.413
my memory's jacked,
but I will do my best.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.515
Hey, gang,
just wanted everyone

03:01.549 --> 03:04.084
to give
our new music teacher,
Lainey Lewis,

03:04.117 --> 03:06.820
a big
teachers lounge welcome.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.422
COACH MELLOR: All right!
All right, all right!

03:08.456 --> 03:09.790
So, I bet
it's pretty exciting

03:09.823 --> 03:11.492
getting a glimpse
behind the curtain, huh?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.960
Oh, yeah. Getting to see
your old gym teacher

03:12.993 --> 03:14.328
slurp down
that thick drink.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.529
S-So magical.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.831
Chicken and beets.
Still warm.
You want a pull?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.367
I'm good.
Thanks, Coach Mellor.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.270
Coach Mellor? Come on,
you're one of us now.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.672
From here on out,
it's first names only.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.839
You got it.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.208
I wanna say Stanley?

03:28.242 --> 03:29.677
No. It's John.

Wow.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.513
Anyways,
uh, any questions?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.615
Yeah. When do
the paychecks start?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.817
(CHUCKLES) As if we're here
for the money, right?

03:36.850 --> 03:38.486
(CHUCKLES)

03:38.519 --> 03:41.455
Wait, no, you're not actually
here for the money, are you?

03:41.489 --> 03:42.656
Of course not.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.024
But is it possible

03:44.057 --> 03:45.893
to get the
whole year's salary
in one lump sum?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.195
Because I have a bit of
a credit-card disagreement.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.164
Okay, I know that being
a teacher wasn't your dream,

03:51.198 --> 03:53.467
but it is my dream
as the new principal

03:53.501 --> 03:54.835
not to look like an idiot.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.337
So try.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.205
Look, why don't you
grab your syllabus,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.741
and let's get to
making a difference
in those kids' lives.

LAINEY: While I was struggling
with the basics of teaching,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.355
Coach Mellor was
about to get a lesson

04:14.388 --> 04:16.189
on the changing style
of basketball.

04:18.292 --> 04:21.495
For years,
Coach prided himself
on teaching teamwork,

04:21.529 --> 04:26.367
but he was finding
that kids in the '90s
had different ideas.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.869
Whoa!
What the hell was that?

04:28.902 --> 04:31.839
I think it was a pump fake
followed by a monster jam.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.707
Okay. If you want
to make my team,

04:33.741 --> 04:36.410
you always pass three times
before you shoot.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.211
You think Michael Jordan
passes three times?

like Mike, huh?

a very,

06:43.504 --> 06:45.806
about the dos and don'ts
of educating.

She's an angry
rage monster.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.702
She's my niece.
So you get it.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.303
I actually think
that you could help Felicia.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.906
She's just like you were
in high school, except worse.

She's nothing like me.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.376

disrespectful...

07:56.409 --> 07:57.711
That does sound like me.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.780
But she doesn't sing,
and I would always sing.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.583
Actually, Felicia's
the best singer in the school.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.285
She just completely shut down
since her parents split up.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.454
That's awesome.
What? Why?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.089
That's what happened to me
in high school!

08:09.122 --> 08:10.958
Maybe I can connect with her
over it and stuff.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.326

like a teacher.

to connect with Felicia,

08:25.172 --> 08:29.409

I knew just where to find her.

about people who piss me off.

The truth is,
I'm not the enemy.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.032
I get what
you're going through.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.134
My parents got divorced
when I was in high school,
too.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.536
So that's why
you're still a mess.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.872

a smartass about this?

were gonna connect!

Who wants to vibe
about divorce?

09:04.444 --> 09:06.947

you suck at this.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.524
For my book report
on Zima.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.093
I didn't just invent
the "see the nurse
to cut class" move.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.262
I also invented the "party
under the bleachers" move.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.164
So, now what?

09:24.197 --> 09:26.533
Now you're gonna sing

we connected
and I inspired you.

that you have a taste

09:31.705 --> 09:34.241

of fruit-flavored alcohol.

It's a knee-length

to resemble a skirt!

Hail Mary,

Whoever misses next
loses.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.425
(PANTING)

15:58.458 --> 16:00.093
It's game time,
Coach.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.733
I know
you can't do that.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.637
You sure about that,
hot shot?

16:20.213 --> 16:21.814
(SCREAMS)
(THUD)

16:21.848 --> 16:23.216
Nothing but net.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.252
Are you crazy?
You could have
killed yourself!

16:25.285 --> 16:26.653
I'm fine.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.088
Question is,
how are you?

16:28.121 --> 16:29.589
After all, you won.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.792
Well, seeing as you almost
broke your neck... (CHUCKLES)

16:32.825 --> 16:33.926
...it feels
kind of empty.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.328
Yeah, well,
maybe that's 'cause

16:35.362 --> 16:36.863
there's nobody here
to share it with.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.166
But if you had a team,
you're never alone.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.268
Why do you care
so much?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.104
You're the best athlete
I've ever coached.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.640
At this level, you can
do it all on your own,

16:47.674 --> 16:50.910
but if you go pro,
you're gonna need
to rely on a team.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.346
Until you learn that,
I'll never give up.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.217
(CHUCKLES)
Okay.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.353
I get it.

LAINEY: Coach had
finally found a way
to get through to Matty.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.692
As for me,
I was more lost than ever.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.827
Crying in the teachers lounge
after hours, huh?

17:07.860 --> 17:08.995
Well...

17:10.063 --> 17:12.165
I guess you really are
a teacher now.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.533
It's been a tough week.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.602
Uh-huh.
Tell me about it. (SIGHS)

17:15.635 --> 17:18.438
Please.
You were born to teach.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.474
But me? I sucked
at being a rock star,
and I suck at this.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.176
"Born to teach"?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.345
When I was your age,
I wanted to go
to the Olympics.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.813
Wanted to be a wrestler.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.215
But I blew my knee out.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.016
I didn't know that.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.785
And after I got hurt,
I thought I had nothing left.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.888
Then an old high school coach
suggested that,

17:35.922 --> 17:39.459
with my passion for sports,
I might be a good teacher.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.362
I always thought this was,
like, what you wanted.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.663
It is now.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.033
I see a kid win,
make a difference
in their life,

17:47.066 --> 17:48.901
that's better
than any gold medal.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.904
You'll feel it, too.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.941
Actually,
I did feel it, too.

17:54.974 --> 17:57.110
But then Glascott said
I was doing it all wrong.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.112
Were you?
I didn't think so.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.980
Well, then,
that's all that matters.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.150
In this job,
the best teachers
follow their hearts,

18:03.183 --> 18:04.417
no matter what.

(UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)

Thanks, Coach.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.388

18:08.421 --> 18:09.622
You're one of us now.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.427
LAINEY: Rick showed me
that even the best teachers

18:14.461 --> 18:17.096
have to find new ways
to inspire their students.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.366
He even found a way
to inspire me.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.374
You here
to search my locker?

18:27.407 --> 18:29.041
No, I'm here
to apologize

18:29.075 --> 18:30.710
for not sticking
up for you guys
the other day.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.313
Thanks, I guess.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.114
You know what?
Between the wine coolers,

18:35.148 --> 18:37.517
our crappy attitudes,
and our parents' divorces,

18:37.550 --> 18:38.985
we're kind of the same.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.721
Look, when I was
a student here,

18:41.754 --> 18:44.357
I thought the teachers
were super annoying.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.427
But the truth is,
they helped me
get through a lot of stuff.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.928
Actually,
they still do.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.898
Maybe I can be
your annoying teacher.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.634
I wouldn't hate that.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.603
Here.
You're gonna need this.

Seeing Felicia up there
doing what she loved,

19:05.077 --> 19:07.214
what I loved,
I realized that

19:07.247 --> 19:09.982
even though I might
have put my dreams
on hold for this job,

19:10.016 --> 19:14.287
in the end, I got
a lot more back than
I ever thought possible.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.426
We need to talk
about this concert.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.160

19:21.194 --> 19:22.962
It's crazy and dangerous
and awesome,

19:22.995 --> 19:25.298
and if I'm gonna work here,
then I do it my way.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.635
I have so much to learn,
but the one thing I know
is I can do this.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.003
Actually, I was gonna say
"Well done."

19:31.037 --> 19:32.171
What?

19:32.205 --> 19:34.741
These kids are having the time
of their lives in there.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
You did that.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.312
And while you do
have a lot to learn,

19:39.346 --> 19:40.980
I'm gonna have to learn
to trust you.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.482
Good.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.783
And thank you.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.286

Understand?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.421

19:54.727 --> 19:56.696
but whether
you're ready for it or not,

19:56.729 --> 19:58.698
it's gonna happen.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.166
And if you embrace it,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.802
you might just discover
new things about yourself.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.137
And when you have a team
who supports you,

20:05.171 --> 20:08.808
together, you can fly
higher than you ever
thought possible.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.178

the new uniforms, Coach.

So am I.

They really let the quads
breathe, you know?

20:18.017 --> 20:19.286
You look weird.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.421
I feel weird, Matty.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.523
Speaking of change,
you know, our football team

20:23.556 --> 20:26.058
could use a quarterback
with an arm like yours.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.027
Because of that game of HORSE?
We were just goofing around.

I got a hunch.

I'm Rick Mellor,
high school football coach.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.345
I'm Matt Ryan,
NFL quarterback.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.714
I have
so many good memories,

20:47.747 --> 20:50.016
whether it was playing
basketball, Ping-Pong...

20:50.049 --> 20:51.083
Hitting the crossbar.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.353
Hitting the crossbar
at football practice after...

20:53.386 --> 20:54.421
They banned that,
by the way.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.655
Oh, man,
they need to bring that...

20:55.688 --> 20:56.723
That's how I got good,
I think.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.224
Matt played
all three sports.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.327
He actually started for me
as a freshman in baseball.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.861
And I think
one of the
finest memories...

21:01.894 --> 21:03.996
Matt hit
a line-drive foul ball...

21:04.030 --> 21:06.399
(LAUGHING)
And I almost killed you.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.034
I almost killed him
on the third-base line.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.602
I forgot until
you brought that up,

21:09.636 --> 21:11.504
but I literally
almost killed Rick.

21:11.538 --> 21:15.342
I think anybody growing up
idolized Michael Jordan.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.710
And then they got
a little bit longer.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.679
You know,
I was really lucky

21:19.712 --> 21:22.181
to have coaches
like Coach Mellor.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.250
And it was
a unique relationship

21:24.283 --> 21:26.419
and something
that was very special to me.
