00:05.567 --> 00:07.400
- Whoo-hoo!

00:07.433 --> 00:09.600
That's how you do it
in Canada, mother!

00:09.667 --> 00:14.000
I'm newly single, and I've had
my eye on Dr. Nassif.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.166
This is like a date.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.533
- Is that your reason
for coming here?

00:16.567 --> 00:18.000
You want to date him?

00:18.033 --> 00:19.266
- Dr. Nassif is very handsome.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.266
Short, dark, and handsome.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.400
- He did local anesthesia.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.100
It probably was
a couple of hours.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.533
And here's the crazy part--

00:26.567 --> 00:28.266
he said he was going to go see
the other patient.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.133
I went to the bathroom.

00:30.166 --> 00:33.533
I could see bone, blood.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.166
I was just like...

00:35.200 --> 00:37.033
I didn't even want to
go back in there.

00:37.066 --> 00:39.300
- This story is surreal.

00:39.333 --> 00:40.433
- I went in for a tummy tuck.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.300
I had sneezed,
and I felt this pop.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.633
- This is no joke.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.333
I'm a little bit
at of a loss.

00:45.367 --> 00:47.567
We just have to assume that it's
entrapped nerve.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.166
See that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.033
- It's not a good day
in the operating room.

- My name is Kelli Johnson.
I'm 42 years old.

01:08.233 --> 01:09.567
And I live
in Westland, Michigan.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.300
And my nose is turnt up,

01:11.333 --> 01:13.166
but not like the club.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.166
I started modeling
when I was ten years old.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.567
My mom thought I'd be
really great at it

01:16.600 --> 01:18.567
because I was
such a spunky girl.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.066
But when I was 16,

01:21.100 --> 01:23.066
I got advice
from a photographer

01:23.100 --> 01:25.333
who told me that if you want
to make it in this business,

01:25.367 --> 01:27.300
you're gonna have to
get a nose job.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.667
I didn't think
I needed a nose job,

01:28.734 --> 01:31.200
and I was actually
kind of insulted.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.467
After I move to New York
to pursue modeling,

01:33.500 --> 01:35.600
I just kept getting
the same feedback,

01:35.633 --> 01:38.233
and I noticed that
the girls who got the jobs

01:38.266 --> 01:39.200
had thin noses.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.467
So I faced the fact
that I do need

01:41.500 --> 01:43.600
to get a nose job
if I want to book more jobs.

01:43.633 --> 01:45.400
I felt like
if I don't do it now,

01:45.467 --> 01:47.533
my career may never
take off in modeling.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.633
Immediately after the surgery,
I knew something was wrong.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.066
First of all, there was a piece
of cartilage sticking out.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.467
He kept telling me,

01:54.500 --> 01:56.400
"Oh, it's just swelling.
Don't worry."

01:56.467 --> 01:58.333
But I knew something was wrong

01:58.367 --> 02:00.667
because my nostrils were
different sizes and shapes.

02:00.734 --> 02:04.367
I was mortified.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.233
A year later, I decided
I'm not gonna live

02:07.266 --> 02:08.633
with this nose anymore.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.533
I called the same doctor,
and he said,

02:11.567 --> 02:14.166
"Come on back,
and I'll do it for free."

02:14.233 --> 02:17.633
He numbed me
and covered my eyes.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.300
So I was gonna be awake.

02:19.367 --> 02:22.400
It was about two hours
into the surgery.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.633
He got a call or page

02:24.667 --> 02:26.433
that he had to see
another patient.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.633
And he left me
in the room, alone.

02:29.667 --> 02:32.233
I had to use the bathroom,
so I got up and went.

02:32.266 --> 02:33.500
When I looked in the mirror,

02:33.533 --> 02:37.367
I could see bone, blood.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.367
I was just like...

02:39.400 --> 02:42.100
"Oh, my God.
What am I doing?"

02:42.133 --> 02:46.300
But I had to go back in
and let him finish.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.667
Afterwards,
it looked straight.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.433
But a week or two later,
it started leaning

02:51.467 --> 02:53.633
to the left
and to the left.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.433
And I just said, "Forget it."

02:55.467 --> 02:58.533
I gave up my modeling dreams

02:58.567 --> 03:00.500
because there was no way
I could be a model

03:00.567 --> 03:02.133
with this nose anymore.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.200
It's been 17 years.

03:04.266 --> 03:06.533
This doctor
traumatized me so much

03:54.467 --> 03:57.567
coming up with this whole
wedding situation?

03:57.600 --> 03:59.266
- The engagement photos.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.133
Photographers used to
take my picture,

04:01.200 --> 04:02.266
and that used to be my life.

You know, someone else

to delete the ones

04:11.500 --> 04:12.500

04:41.633 --> 04:42.734
- Scrotum.
- In the scrotum.

You would be nuts
to get Scrotox.

04:45.233 --> 04:46.333
I mean, who would do that?

04:46.367 --> 04:48.633
- To decrease sweating.

and he was

05:34.433 --> 05:36.400
the top 100 doctors
in New York.

05:36.433 --> 05:38.000
And I found him in a magazine.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.667
I thought everything
was gonna be perfect.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.333
But it wasn't.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.667
- Most of the time,
the top 100 doctors

05:43.700 --> 05:47.467
are the first 100
that paid the advertisement fee,

05:47.533 --> 05:50.000
not because they really are
particularly very good

05:50.033 --> 05:51.600
at any one procedure.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.400
- When I went to get
the surgery,

05:53.433 --> 05:55.033

05:55.066 --> 05:57.066

06:00.700 --> 06:02.567

for the second one.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.433
He started, you know--
- Doing something.

06:05.467 --> 06:07.266
- It probably was
a couple of hours,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.700
and then he walked out and left.

06:09.734 --> 06:11.533
- There was nobody in the room
but him and I.

06:11.567 --> 06:14.567

a patient alone.

complete general anesthesia.

06:18.033 --> 06:20.467

He said he was going
to go see the other patient.

06:23.734 --> 06:25.600
I went to the bathroom.

06:25.633 --> 06:27.600
And I saw my face.
I felt sick.

06:27.633 --> 06:29.433
- Was, what, like,
there a cut here and the skin

06:29.467 --> 06:31.033
was lifted up or--
- Yes.

06:31.066 --> 06:33.433

want to go back in there.

we have to make sure
there is absolutely no trauma

06:38.734 --> 06:41.533
with this next
and hopefully final surgery.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.033
How many years ago
was that last revision surgery?

06:44.066 --> 06:46.033
- 17 years ago.

06:46.066 --> 06:47.333
- I was scared.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.700
- How do you feel
about her fixing it?

06:48.734 --> 06:52.300
- I'm the one that suggested
seeing you guys.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.100
And it's not because
I want it fixed.

06:55.133 --> 06:57.500
It's because I know
she's not happy.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.467
- So he wants you
to do it for you.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.667
- Right.
- We like that.

07:00.734 --> 07:02.467
- What are you trying
to achieve now?

07:02.500 --> 07:04.467
- Definitely have
less nostril showing.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.600
And my nostrils would be
the same shape and size.

07:07.633 --> 07:09.333
- With that being said...
- Yeah.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.066
- I think our next step
is to get you in the exam room.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.567
Shall we do that?
- Yeah.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.033
- Let's go.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.600
- Talking to the doctors
was great,

07:15.633 --> 07:17.500
but now I'm hoping
that what he sees in there

07:17.533 --> 07:20.700
is something that he can fix
and that it's not too screwed up

07:20.767 --> 07:22.333
from the fist doctor.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.533
- All right, lower your chin
just a little bit.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.133
So one of the things
I was worried about

07:26.200 --> 07:28.066
is how much
is the skin gonna stretch

07:28.100 --> 07:29.500
so I can lower the nose?

07:29.533 --> 07:31.600
In this situation with Kelli,
good news.

07:31.633 --> 07:35.000
Her skin is mobile,
it's elastic, it stretches.

07:35.033 --> 07:36.367
To elongate your nose,

07:36.400 --> 07:39.000
we do have to use
a little piece of rib.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.633
So we have to take something
called a composite graft,

07:40.667 --> 07:42.433
which is skin and cartilage
from your ear.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.033
I need something
from your scalp.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.467
- It's called fascia.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.500
And make what we call
a burrito--

07:47.533 --> 07:49.467
or a grape leaf,
because I'm Middle Eastern.

07:49.533 --> 07:50.667
We put that right here.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.767
- Whatever. Burrito,
grape leaves,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.433
I don't care if you have to
use a tampon.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.767
Just fix it.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.767
- Right now
let's just say you're at a one.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.500
And a ten's the best.
- Mm-hmm.

08:00.533 --> 08:02.767
- If we got you to a seven,
would you be happy?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.133
- I'd be happy.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.600
Been waiting 17 years
for this.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.100
- So you're ready.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.533
- Yeah.
- I'm so happy!

08:08.567 --> 08:10.133
Whoo!
Can I get a hug?

08:10.166 --> 08:11.367

08:11.400 --> 08:12.567
- Dr. Nassif is gonna give me

08:12.633 --> 08:14.367
a chance to start a new life.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.066
I mean, I quit modeling
because of this.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.467
And that was my dream before.

08:18.533 --> 08:21.033
Now my dream
is to get married

08:22.567 --> 08:24.200
Oh, my God, they're gonna
take my rib?

08:24.266 --> 08:26.367
- Something tells me they have
good pain medicine.

08:26.433 --> 08:29.767
So I think you'll be fine.
- Right.

08:30.033 --> 08:32.400
- We don't lipo this far up

08:32.433 --> 08:34.533
because this is actually
the blood supply.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.000

of Kristina

08:37.467 --> 08:40.000

08:52.700 --> 08:55.000

I'm 30 years old.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.133
And I'm from Calgary, Canada.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.734
I'm a badass bitch,
but I cannot stand

08:59.767 --> 09:01.266
these bad boobs.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.700
Growing up, I've always been
a tomboy.

09:03.734 --> 09:06.533
On weekends, we would
go hunting and fishing.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.567
When I turned 18,
I started to feel

09:09.600 --> 09:11.700
more like a woman,
so I started wearing

09:11.734 --> 09:13.700
makeup and dying my hair.

09:13.734 --> 09:17.000
I got my truck custom
vinyl wrapped pinked.

09:17.066 --> 09:18.600
And I have a pink quad.

09:18.633 --> 09:20.700
And I have many pink guns.

09:20.734 --> 09:24.000
At about 22 years old,
I decided that I would get

09:24.066 --> 09:25.700
my first breast augmentation.

09:25.734 --> 09:29.033
I wanted the full look,
like Pamela Anderson.

09:29.066 --> 09:31.033
And unfortunately,
I didn't have

09:31.066 --> 09:33.000
enough skin on my chest
to stretch.

09:33.066 --> 09:37.266
So doing the breast augmentation
would have to be in steps.

09:37.333 --> 09:40.467
I had 450cc.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.133
And then I talked the doctors

09:42.200 --> 09:46.233
into specially ordering
900cc implants.

09:46.266 --> 09:48.633
I'm still not happy with them.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.600
Even though they're large,
there is a gap between them.

09:51.633 --> 09:55.300
So I'd like to see Dr. Nassif
because I'm newly single,

09:55.367 --> 09:58.166
and I've had my eye
on Dr. Nassif.

09:58.233 --> 10:02.066
I find he's very mysterious

10:02.100 --> 10:04.033
I find him super attractive.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.433
Like, Richard Gere-like.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.200
I'm eager to see if Dr. Nassif

10:07.233 --> 10:10.633
has a nice furry chest
under his doctor jacket.

10:10.667 --> 10:14.734
I like a masculine body,
a furry chest and dark hair.

10:14.767 --> 10:18.300
And I also saw that
he's newly divorced.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.066

becoming concerned,

me concerned.

I had decided I was going
to do protein shakes

and then eating healthy and
clean and working out every day.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.533

I only, in one month,
lost maybe three to five pounds.

11:12.166 --> 11:15.567
So I got really frustrated,
and I talked to my husband,

11:15.600 --> 11:18.033
and we had decided we were
gonna go see a plastic surgeon

11:18.066 --> 11:20.033
and get his opinion
on what I should do.

11:20.066 --> 11:22.100
The consultation
with this doctor, actually,

11:22.166 --> 11:23.600
I thought went well.

I mean, he told me everything

lipo of the flanks and the back.

I believed that my decision
was the right decision.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.100
After surgery,
I was in the recovery room.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.533
I had sneezed,
and I felt this pop

11:37.567 --> 11:40.633
and this pain in the top part
of my abdomen.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.266
And I instantly had said,
"Oh, no. Something is wrong."

11:44.300 --> 11:46.400
When I went in
for my one-week check,

11:46.467 --> 11:48.300

the compression off,

11:48.333 --> 11:50.667
the pain was massive.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.200
I had a huge lump
in the top part of my stomach,

11:53.233 --> 11:56.000
and then my side
had this huge indent.

11:56.066 --> 11:58.133
I did bring it up to the doctor,

11:58.200 --> 12:00.266

"It's totally normal.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.700
Just give it time."

12:01.734 --> 12:03.166

I was in pretty major pain

12:03.200 --> 12:04.567
for months straight.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.066
And then my side
never loosened

12:06.100 --> 12:07.567
or popped back out.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.700
So I felt like,
"What a waste of money."

12:09.734 --> 12:11.133

12:11.200 --> 12:13.000

that I did this to myself.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.200
reach that hand up and back
towards the back of the room

12:17.233 --> 12:18.700

in the knee.

50 to 70 pounds.

nothing we can do right now.

until the one-year mark."

he comes in with his iPad,

you look."

16:43.467 --> 16:46.500

17:04.467 --> 17:09.133
- Yeah, exactly. In general,
we don't lipo this far up

17:09.166 --> 17:11.200
because this is actually
the blood supply.

17:11.266 --> 17:14.100
He got very lucky that this
abdominal skin down here--

17:14.166 --> 17:16.100
and that it healed so well,
which it did.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.166
When tissue doesn't have
adequate blood supply,

17:19.200 --> 17:20.600
it starts necrosis,

17:20.633 --> 17:23.333
which is a fancy term
for cell death.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.333
I think this is
definitely improvable.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.266
This is fixable.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.133
But at the end of the day,

17:30.200 --> 17:32.333
I don't know
what's causing this pain.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.100
I have a feeling
it could be improved.

17:35.166 --> 17:39.100
But let's talk turkey
for a minute, okay?

17:39.166 --> 17:41.400
If we do a revisional
tummy tuck--

17:41.467 --> 17:45.100
remaking this incision,
going further back

17:45.166 --> 17:48.533
to remove this excess skin
and soft tissue,

17:48.600 --> 17:52.100
re-elevating up
the abdominal wall,

17:52.166 --> 17:53.533
putting it back down.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.300
Now, here's the turkey part.
This is no joke.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.633
When you tighten up
the abdominal wall,

17:59.700 --> 18:03.633
it can squeeze down
on the pelvic venous system,

18:03.667 --> 18:07.166
which is the return system
of blood from your legs

18:07.233 --> 18:09.166
and give you a blood clot.

18:09.233 --> 18:11.233
And if it breaks off
and goes to your lungs,

18:11.266 --> 18:15.667
that is when people die
from plastic surgery.

18:15.734 --> 18:17.467
- Mm, that's not good.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.433
They are real risks,
and they make me nervous,

18:19.500 --> 18:22.300
but I need to get it fixed
because it's a huge thing

18:22.367 --> 18:25.300
to live with the fact
that I did this to myself.

18:26.633 --> 18:29.500
Okay, I don't care.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.166
- I'm used to it.
- You got to be used to it.

18:33.233 --> 18:34.033
Yeah.
- Used to it for many years.

18:34.734 --> 18:36.166
- So you think you want
to do this thing?

18:36.233 --> 18:37.567
- I think so.
- She's on board, I'm on board.

18:37.633 --> 18:40.400
- So you need some help,
and we're here to help.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.266
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

18:42.300 --> 18:45.467
I know there's a chance
it may not look totally normal,

18:45.533 --> 18:48.066
but I'm going
to improve myself

18:48.133 --> 18:49.567
for my children
and my husband.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.467
Nice to meet you. Thank you.
- See you guys soon.

18:51.533 --> 18:54.700
♪ ♪

18:54.767 --> 18:57.567
- There you go.

18:57.633 --> 19:00.233
- Good morning.
- I'm here to see Dr. Nassif.

19:00.266 --> 19:02.166
- Okay, go ahead
and just sign in.

19:02.233 --> 19:04.433
- I've been waiting so long
to get my nose fixed.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.400
I'm nervous. I'm excited.
I'm--I'm just--

19:08.433 --> 19:10.133
I can't even put it
into words.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.500
I'm just gonna think
about our engagement photos.

19:12.533 --> 19:14.133
I'm gonna think
about the wedding.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.166
- Three months
for the swelling to go down.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.400
It's gonna go by quick.

19:17.433 --> 19:19.300
- I hope it's gone down
in time.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.600
The doctor's waiting
to see you.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.333
- Okay.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.633
- Hey, wait, give me a hug.
- All right.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.600
- Even though my last surgery
was really traumatic,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.467
the doctor shouldn't have
left me alone.

19:30.533 --> 19:32.166
I should not have been
going to the bathroom

19:32.200 --> 19:33.567
with my face open.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.200
I know that there's
no other person

19:36.266 --> 19:37.700
I would want
working on my nose

19:37.734 --> 19:39.233
than Dr. Nassif.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.100
- Miss Kelli!
- Dr. Nassif.

19:41.166 --> 19:42.667
- You know Dr. Ping.
- Yes.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.367
- Yes.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.133
- All right. Let's talk.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.300
17 years.
- 17 years.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.367
- You could've said,
"I'm avoiding surgery."

19:50.433 --> 19:52.233
- Yes.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.367
Do you feel good about this?
- I do.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.500
- Okay. You don't have
any anxiety right now?

19:56.567 --> 19:58.467
- I do have a little anxiety.

19:58.533 --> 20:00.367
- Kelli put her trust in her
doctor not once, but twice.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.667
That left her emotionally
and physically traumatized.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.600
I mean, this is a great day,
because Kelli

20:05.667 --> 20:10.266
is gonna finally get the help
that she deserves and needs.

20:10.333 --> 20:13.133
What makes Kelli's nose
a little bit more challenging

20:13.200 --> 20:15.233
is this is her third surgery.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.600
So there's always a slight risk

20:16.633 --> 20:18.333
to the blood supply
to that area.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.567
In addition, how much can we
actually lower the nose?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.567
We don't know that yet
until we get in there.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.133
To fix Kelli's nose,
we'll start by harvesting rib

20:25.200 --> 20:27.133
and taking composite grafts
from her ear

20:27.200 --> 20:28.467
and fascia
from her left temple.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.266
I will then open up her nose
and give her a better airway.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.133
Finally,
I will use dice cartilage

20:33.200 --> 20:34.767
wrapped in fascia to build up
the bridge

20:35.033 --> 20:36.400
and lower her nostrils.

20:36.467 --> 20:37.767
Okay, so, yeah,
let's start with the rib

20:38.033 --> 20:39.467
and then the ear
simultaneously.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.400
I'm probably gonna have
the table up a little bit.

20:41.467 --> 20:44.166
Okay, here's a composite graft.
- Perfect.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.333
- Kelli's surgery today is very
different than the last one.

20:46.367 --> 20:48.367
There was one doctor, alone,
in an operating room.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.600
Today we have a nurse,
an anesthesiologist,

20:51.633 --> 20:55.166
two techs, and three surgeons.

20:55.233 --> 20:56.533
It's a lot of people.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.266
Dr. Ping, it's nice
having you next to me.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.367
Thanks.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.567
- Okay, we finished with
the right composite graft.

21:02.633 --> 21:06.300
Let's now start the fascia
on the left.

21:06.367 --> 21:08.433
Making the incision
for the fascia.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.367
- We got the rib free.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.567
- Oh, that's a nice rib.

21:11.633 --> 21:13.166
Reconstructing
an entire nose is like

21:13.233 --> 21:14.300
building a complete house.

21:14.367 --> 21:16.000
Rib, fascia, composite grafts

21:16.066 --> 21:18.000
make the perfect foundation.

21:18.066 --> 21:20.233
Making the incision
for the rhinoplasty.

21:20.266 --> 21:22.333
15 blade.

21:22.367 --> 21:25.200
And what is that?
.

21:25.233 --> 21:27.433
There might be a piece
of septal cartilage

21:27.500 --> 21:31.266
or something just right here
in the columella.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.467
Ah.

21:32.533 --> 21:34.533
I mean, the tip
is definitely firm,

21:34.567 --> 21:38.200
making it a difficult,
really firm dissection.

21:38.266 --> 21:40.467
Can I have an 11 blade now?
Okay.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.333
One thing I encountered
during Kelli's surgery

21:42.400 --> 21:43.700
is a lot of scar tissue.

21:43.767 --> 21:45.400
And we don't want that
because that means

21:45.433 --> 21:47.300
we're probably gonna develop
more scar tissue

21:47.367 --> 21:51.367
after the surgery, which could,
again, cause problems healing.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.266
This is a columellar strut

21:53.300 --> 21:55.033
It was taken
from Kelli's septum.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.467
And now we're starting
to rebuild the tip,

21:56.533 --> 21:58.734
by first placing
a septal extension graft.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.200
A columellar strut
is a piece of cartilage,

22:01.266 --> 22:03.333
most likely taken
from Kelli's septum.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.533
Sometimes doctors use it
to add a little bit

22:05.567 --> 22:07.200
of strength to the tip.

22:07.266 --> 22:09.300
But it's really not
gonna lower the tip.

22:09.367 --> 22:12.467
Yeah, the more we can advance
the middle wall forward,

22:12.533 --> 22:14.467
that will help
lengthen her nose,

22:14.533 --> 22:16.000
'cause right now you can see

22:16.033 --> 22:18.367
completely inside
of her nostrils.

22:18.433 --> 22:20.400
The most important thing
when I'm performing a nose job

22:20.433 --> 22:21.767
is if you can
see inside the nose,

22:22.033 --> 22:23.500
you're gonna stare at it.

22:23.567 --> 22:25.700
So we have to
make Kelli's nose disappear.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.767
I can never imagine a patient

22:28.033 --> 22:29.567
seeing what their nose looks
like open like this.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.300
I mean, even me,
as a doctor,

22:31.333 --> 22:32.767
if I woke up and I saw this,

22:33.033 --> 22:34.767
I know that I would
get pretty sick.

22:35.033 --> 22:37.600
But hopefully
she'll be absolutely happy

22:37.667 --> 22:39.033
with her outcome.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.033
I expect to get nostrils

22:41.066 --> 22:43.033
about 80% to 85% lower.

22:43.066 --> 22:44.633
So that pig look is gone.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.066
I mean, this is
a remarkable difference.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.700
So this tip has been lowered
a lot.

22:49.734 --> 22:52.333
Probably about
a good 6, 7 millimeters.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.367
Everything looks
pretty darn good.

22:54.433 --> 22:57.667
I did not expect to take
an angle that was like this--

22:57.734 --> 22:59.667
probably about 145 degrees--

22:59.734 --> 23:02.000
and bring it down
about 95 degrees.

23:02.066 --> 23:03.767
So, at this point,
we just have to make sure

23:04.033 --> 23:06.400
the columella skin survives.

23:06.467 --> 23:08.500
She is gonna like this.
- She is.

23:08.567 --> 23:09.433
- And her fiancé's
gonna like it.

23:10.333 --> 23:11.533
- I think so.
- But he thinks

23:12.734 --> 23:13.600
she looks beautiful
with or without the nose job,

23:13.633 --> 23:17.000
so that's a good man for you.

23:17.066 --> 23:18.567
- Well, you're my future
ex-husband anyway.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.734
If Tahnee is this into Paul,

23:21.767 --> 23:23.533
the last thing
she needs is surgery.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.400
She needs to go
have her eyes checked.

23:25.467 --> 23:28.367
It's not a good day
in the operating room.

I was probably

24:15.633 --> 24:16.734

24:20.133 --> 24:22.400

24:22.433 --> 24:25.700
- You realize that she's just
Calgary's sweetheart.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.600
I was thinking about getting
my chest bigger.

24:30.667 --> 24:31.667
- Aw, Tahnee.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.066
They're already huge.

24:33.133 --> 24:34.767

really good doctors out in L.A.

24:40.133 --> 24:42.467
I don't like
this space in between.

24:42.533 --> 24:45.133
This gap. So maybe
if they make them bigger,

24:45.166 --> 24:47.567
I'll have a smaller gap.
- Yeah.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.767
All right, well, we're gonna
have to look into it.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.500
- We'll see.
I trust these guys.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.367
I've heard a lot
of good things about them.

24:53.400 --> 24:58.166
Actually, I heard that one of
the doctors is newly divorced.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.767
- Ooh.
- So he's single.

25:00.033 --> 25:01.633
- Oh, he's handsome.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.166
- Oh, my goodness.
- I hear he's got, like,

25:04.200 --> 25:07.033
a hairy chest--
he's sort of Italian-looking.

25:07.066 --> 25:10.767
I feel like "Tahnee Nassif"
has a bit of a ring to it.

25:11.033 --> 25:12.433
And he's a plastic surgeon.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.767
Maybe I'll get to
go on a date with him.

25:14.033 --> 25:15.433
- So it's perfect.

25:15.467 --> 25:17.000
- Well, you're a girl
that gets what she wants.

25:17.033 --> 25:19.033
- Yeah.
- I hope Tahnee finds love

25:19.066 --> 25:21.033
because she's been single
for way too long.

25:21.066 --> 25:22.233
I do not want her to hear that.

25:22.300 --> 25:24.100
I'll come with you.
- Okay.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.667
- And we'll check it out.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.000
- We'll show them
how girls in Canada do it.

25:28.033 --> 25:30.133
I'm super excited
to be going to L.A.

25:30.166 --> 25:32.467
to get some work done,
hopefully.

25:32.533 --> 25:35.066
But I would sure like
to find love also.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.367
Whoo!

25:37.433 --> 25:39.000
Eat that, .

25:39.033 --> 25:41.433
That's how you do it
in Canada, mother!

- Hey, Terry.
- Hey!

25:52.066 --> 25:53.734
How are you?
- Good to see you.

25:53.767 --> 25:56.700
- It's been a long time.
Good to see you.

25:56.734 --> 25:58.767
Dr. Lesavoy
has been my mentor.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.433
He's actually the reason
I went into plastic surgery.

26:01.467 --> 26:03.133
You never age.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.567
How come I've gotten older
but you still look the same?

26:05.600 --> 26:07.567
Dr. Lesavoy's a renaissance
plastic surgeon

26:07.600 --> 26:09.667
who really cares
about the patient.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.500
And he's just really cool.

26:11.567 --> 26:13.166
I was a second-year
med student,

26:13.200 --> 26:15.567
and you walked in
in those cowboy boots.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.667
We all said, "Whoa, okay."
Do you have the boots on?

26:17.734 --> 26:19.000
The cowboy boots?
- Yeah, sure.

26:19.066 --> 26:20.266
- You still got
the cowboy boots on.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.100
- I don't own any shoes.

26:22.133 --> 26:23.734
- You don't remember this,
but I followed you out,

26:23.767 --> 26:25.200
and I go, "Hey, um, so--"
- Yeah, you were trying

26:25.233 --> 26:26.533
to kiss my ass.
- I was trying to kiss your ass.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.200
- Yeah.

26:28.233 --> 26:30.767
I ended up spending seven years
in a laboratory with you.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.200
- Yeah. There were
a couple times

26:32.233 --> 26:33.467
when I had to save your ass.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.166
- With the other faculty,
you know?

26:36.233 --> 26:37.700
- Yeah.
- 'Cause of your personality,

26:37.767 --> 26:39.233
kind of brashness
and everything else.

26:39.266 --> 26:41.100
both:
Little brash.

26:41.133 --> 26:45.266
- Dr. Lesavoy has seen and done
some of the most difficult cases

26:45.333 --> 26:47.166
that have ever been reported.

26:47.233 --> 26:49.633
So he's a good resource
when I'm dealing

26:49.667 --> 26:52.000
with unique
and original problems.

26:52.066 --> 26:53.667
The reason I asked you down
is because--

26:53.734 --> 26:56.200
patient's 38 years old,
had a tummy tuck,

26:56.233 --> 26:58.767
and post-operatively,
she noticed a pop

26:59.000 --> 27:00.700
and immediately saw swelling.

27:00.767 --> 27:03.500
But she also has had
chronic pain in that area.

27:03.533 --> 27:05.000
- Yeah, okay.

27:05.033 --> 27:07.033
- You know, I'm a little bit
at of a loss.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.767
- We have, like, three or four
or five different options

27:10.000 --> 27:11.734
of what we could find.
- Right.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.567
- Either way, it's pretty
possible that we could fix it.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.767
- Right.
- But here's the thing

27:16.000 --> 27:17.600
in plastic surgery, you know--

27:17.667 --> 27:20.100
it's not technically
what you do with your hands.

27:20.133 --> 27:21.600
It's what you do
with your head.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.066
Think out of the box.
- Right.

27:23.133 --> 27:24.333
- And you're always thinking
out of the box.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.100
- Always.
- Yeah. Except your skull

27:26.133 --> 27:27.333
is so hard, I don't know
how you can think

27:27.400 --> 27:28.767
out of the box.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.633
Want to go meet her?
- Yeah, let's go.

27:30.667 --> 27:33.600
- All right, let's go in.

27:33.667 --> 27:35.734
Kristina, how are you?

27:36.000 --> 27:39.233
both: Good to see you.
- This is my mentor.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.000
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

27:41.033 --> 27:42.700
Nice to see you.
- Dr. Malcolm Lesavoy.

27:42.767 --> 27:44.333
So any problems that you have,

27:44.400 --> 27:46.133
you can blame him.
- I'll take the blame.

27:46.166 --> 27:49.367
- Dr. Lesavoy
is the premiere surgeon

27:49.433 --> 27:50.767
for difficult problems

27:51.033 --> 27:52.633
who taught me how to
do difficult problems.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.066
So your problem...
- Thank you.

27:54.133 --> 27:56.200
- Is so unique,
I thought I would

27:56.266 --> 27:58.567
do something special
and bring my mentor...

27:58.600 --> 28:00.567
- Well, that's awesome.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.000
- That's really cool.
- All right.

28:02.033 --> 28:03.266
Where's the bartender?

28:03.300 --> 28:05.633
- Only if I can have one, too.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.266
I'm definitely
feeling nervous--

28:07.300 --> 28:09.133
relieved, actually,
excited.

28:09.166 --> 28:11.133
I'm hoping, you know,
today's gonna be the day

28:11.166 --> 28:13.000
everything gets fixed.

28:13.033 --> 28:15.000
So I'm hoping from here on,
the pain will be relieved.

28:15.033 --> 28:16.633
- This is gonna be cool. I'm
interested to see what we find.

28:16.700 --> 28:17.767
- Yeah.

28:19.066 --> 28:20.033
No matter
what everyone says about you...

28:20.066 --> 28:21.066
- Yeah.
- You're a great guy.

28:22.266 --> 28:24.000
I will begin Kristina's surgery

28:24.033 --> 28:25.667
by making an incision
on the lower abdomen,

28:25.700 --> 28:27.567
from hip bone to hip bone.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.700
I will inspect the area
just below her chest bone

28:29.734 --> 28:32.567
to see if I can find
any visible cause of her pain.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.066
Then I will repair
her ab separation

28:35.100 --> 28:36.700
by sewing
the muscles together.

28:36.734 --> 28:39.667
Lastly, I will remove
the excess skin on her sides

28:39.734 --> 28:41.767
to make both hips symmetrical.

28:42.033 --> 28:44.200
I think the surgeon had
a bad day when he did her,

28:44.233 --> 28:46.767
because she ended up
in chronic pain.

28:47.033 --> 28:48.767
It's not a good day
in the operating room.

28:49.033 --> 28:51.667
- Yeah.

28:51.734 --> 28:53.767
Okay, so we're getting
into the area now.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.734
You can see
these fascial sutures

28:55.767 --> 28:57.166
appear to separate up here.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.367
See that?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

28:58.433 --> 29:00.700
- She actually has
a significant separation.

29:00.734 --> 29:02.266
- Yeah, you can see
the sutures.

29:02.333 --> 29:03.600
One of the reasons probably

29:03.633 --> 29:05.166
is that he used
a running suture.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.066
- It's really important,
in my opinion,

29:07.100 --> 29:09.266
to repair the muscles
in two layers.

29:09.333 --> 29:11.767
The first layer
is interrupted sutures.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.333
The second layer is an overlying
layer of a running suture

29:15.367 --> 29:17.166
that goes back and forth.

29:17.233 --> 29:20.333
That's what we call
a belt-and-suspenders approach.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.133
Okay, let me just
see something.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.066
Whoa. Much more lax
than I expected.

29:24.100 --> 29:28.667
So she has a 12-centimeter
diastasis above.

29:28.734 --> 29:32.133
So let's repair
her separated muscles.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.300
Diastasis is a separation
of the abdominal wall muscles

29:36.367 --> 29:38.633
that's very common
after pregnancy.

29:38.667 --> 29:41.000
But I've never
seen one this wide,

29:41.066 --> 29:42.667
particularly in someone
who supposedly

29:42.734 --> 29:46.033
had undergone muscle repair
during a tummy tuck.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.734
The only thing I don't like
about what we found

29:47.767 --> 29:49.633
is it doesn't completely
explain the pain.

29:49.667 --> 29:52.200
We just have to assume
that it's entrapped nerves

29:52.266 --> 29:55.333
that hopefully are disrupted
by elevating the flap.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.166
- That's true.

29:57.233 --> 29:59.266
- When you've had
a previous operation,

29:59.300 --> 30:00.300
nerves regrow.

30:00.367 --> 30:01.734
During that regrowth process,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.400
they can become entrapped
in scar tissue

30:04.433 --> 30:08.166
and lead to
inflammatory nerve syndrome.

30:08.233 --> 30:09.433
So we're gonna
cut a bunch of skin.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.633
Now that the abdominal wall
is flatter,

30:11.667 --> 30:13.100
it makes the skin looser.

30:13.133 --> 30:15.133
So all this
needs to be tightened.

30:15.166 --> 30:17.433
- Be careful, you don't want
to upset the apple cart.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.266
- So now I can remove
the portion of the shelf

30:20.300 --> 30:22.367
that's giving her
that contour irregularity,

30:22.400 --> 30:25.767
and hopefully the blood supply
will allow it to heal properly.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.233
So I basically
not only removed the shelf,

30:28.266 --> 30:30.100
I tucked it up into the side.

30:30.133 --> 30:33.266
I think that she will get
the result she wants.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.066
- You're the absolute best.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.400
- I'm sorry.
What'd you say?

30:36.433 --> 30:38.467
- I said you
are the absolute best.

30:38.533 --> 30:40.166
- You.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.500
- Dr. Dubrow.

30:41.567 --> 30:42.734
- Okay.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.367
- Okay.

30:44.433 --> 30:46.100
- I beg you not to
repeat yourself.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.000
- Well, if I'm the best
and you trained me,

30:48.033 --> 30:49.266
what does that make you?

30:49.300 --> 30:50.700
- That means I'm super best.

30:50.734 --> 30:52.700
- But anyway, thank you.
I appreciate it.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.200
- Let me look at your nose.

30:56.266 --> 30:59.500
Okay. The skin right here
could die.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.767
- So maybe you could take me
on a date later.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.433

31:14.200 --> 31:15.667

She's had surgical procedures.

31:17.433 --> 31:19.266
So her name's Tahnee.
Why don't you bring her in?

31:19.333 --> 31:20.700
And we'll see
what's going on with her.

31:20.734 --> 31:23.667

send in Tahnee?

31:23.734 --> 31:26.066

How are you?

31:26.100 --> 31:28.033
- Tahnee. Dr. Nassif.
- Nice to meet you.

31:28.066 --> 31:30.033
- Hi, Tahnee. Terry Dubrow.
- Nice to meet you.

31:30.066 --> 31:32.700
- So from where
do you guys come in?

31:32.734 --> 31:34.433
- Canada.
- Calgary.

31:34.467 --> 31:36.166
- I've been to Calgary.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.367
- Oh, yeah.
I was there twice.

31:37.433 --> 31:39.166
- Well, you're my future
ex-husband anyway.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.667
So we're good.

31:40.734 --> 31:43.166
- Dr. Nassif is very handsome.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.166
Short, dark, and handsome.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.367
This is like a date.

31:47.433 --> 31:49.033
- Is that your reason
for coming here?

31:49.066 --> 31:50.166
You want to date him?

31:51.300 --> 31:52.433
- I feel like you have a nice,
like, furry chest under there.

31:52.467 --> 31:54.100
I love furry chests.

31:54.166 --> 31:57.000
- If you like furry,
you will love this guy.

31:57.066 --> 31:58.533
- Run my fingers through
the furry--Okay.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.433
- Oh, yeah.
You're Jane to his Tarzan.

32:00.500 --> 32:04.734
- I'd be a good stepmom,
I think.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.200
- If Tahnee is this into Paul,

32:10.233 --> 32:12.066
the last thing
she needs is surgery.

32:12.100 --> 32:13.467
She needs to
go back home to Canada

32:13.500 --> 32:14.467
and have her eyes checked.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.266
I hear they have good insurance.

32:16.333 --> 32:18.367
So tell us a little bit
about what happened

32:18.400 --> 32:19.734
and where you're at now.

32:19.767 --> 32:22.000
- My first implants were 450.
- Okay.

32:22.066 --> 32:23.200
Did they look good at 450?

32:23.233 --> 32:26.333
- No. They were really,
very far apart.

32:26.367 --> 32:28.467
But I thought
the bigger you go, of course,

32:28.500 --> 32:30.433
it's gonna fill that gap.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.767
- No, and now I'm 900ccs.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.066
- So you must have
saline, right?

32:34.100 --> 32:35.467
- No, I have silicone.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.133
- They don't make silicone
in 900s.

32:37.166 --> 32:39.100
- They got me gel ones.
- Yeah.

32:39.133 --> 32:42.000
- That's what I have.
- So you have 800.

32:42.033 --> 32:44.100
Doesn't matter.
- I was told they were 900.

32:44.133 --> 32:46.433
I guess I'm gonna call my doctor
when we leave here.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.133
- Okay, so what
are your goals now?

32:48.166 --> 32:50.066
- I don't know if going bigger
would fix them.

32:50.133 --> 32:52.133
- By fix them, you mean you want
less of a gap

32:52.166 --> 32:53.367
between them, right?

32:53.400 --> 32:55.400
- Less of a gap,
and it causes me back pain.

32:55.433 --> 32:57.066
- You already have
back pain now?

32:57.133 --> 32:58.367
- Yeah.
- Yes.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.133
- Well, what do you think's
gonna happen

33:00.166 --> 33:01.266
if you have bigger implants?

33:01.300 --> 33:03.100
- Okay, this is what
I was thinking--

33:03.133 --> 33:05.100
What if you get a butt implant?
- Mm.

33:05.133 --> 33:06.400
- Now...

33:06.433 --> 33:08.133
To balance it?

33:08.166 --> 33:11.100
- That might sound odd to you,
but it's worth a try.

33:11.133 --> 33:12.767
both: No.
- I don't think you need to be

33:13.000 --> 33:14.767
a rocket scientist
to figure this out.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.266
A bigger implant means more
silicone, heavier on the chest,

33:18.300 --> 33:20.200
more strain on the back.

33:20.266 --> 33:21.533
- Why don't we go
in the exam room

33:21.567 --> 33:23.133
and do a careful physical exam?

33:23.166 --> 33:24.266
- Oh, I thought
you were gonna say

33:24.300 --> 33:25.467
to do penis enlargements
on each other.

33:25.533 --> 33:27.066
And I was gonna say,
"Could we see?"

33:27.133 --> 33:29.567
But that's inappropriate,
isn't it?

33:29.600 --> 33:32.233
- They don't call me
Massive Nassif for nothing.

33:32.300 --> 33:37.133
And, no, I'm not talking
about my weight.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.600
- Well, I'd like
everything done.

33:38.667 --> 33:40.133
- I know.
Like the Kardashians.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.533
- Maybe he can
give me some babies.

33:41.567 --> 33:43.400
- Yeah. Well, we're gonna
have to take off

33:43.433 --> 33:45.000
more than that damn vest.

33:46.133 --> 33:48.200
- Oh, my.

33:48.266 --> 33:50.600
Hello. Okay, so do you guys
think I look

33:50.667 --> 33:53.266
like Lady Gaga right now?
- You do.

33:53.300 --> 33:54.600
- Look at those shoes.
- Can't walk in 'em,

33:54.667 --> 33:56.266
but they look okay
when I'm sitting.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.000
- Cocktail shoes.

33:58.033 --> 34:00.400
- Okay, so let's look
at your chest for a second.

34:00.467 --> 34:02.200
They're in a
really good position.

34:02.233 --> 34:07.166
What you do have, though, is you
have a very convex rib cage,

34:07.200 --> 34:09.166
meaning
it's pointing outwards.

34:09.200 --> 34:13.100
So you actually have
quite a normal gap.

34:13.166 --> 34:15.567
If we were to make
the pocket larger,

34:15.600 --> 34:18.233
your nipples would do this.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.433
- Oh.

34:19.467 --> 34:21.367
- Look at your nipples.
Look how far out.

34:21.433 --> 34:25.233
They would essentially be
3:00 here and 9:00 there.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.166
And it'd be closing time.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.600
Because
of her convex rib cage,

34:31.633 --> 34:34.433
her nipples will point
further outward.

34:34.467 --> 34:36.166
And that will look bizarre.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.333
Would you really want
an operation

34:38.467 --> 34:41.100
that moved your breasts closer
but moved your areolas outward?

34:41.166 --> 34:42.600
- That would not
be smart, no.

34:42.633 --> 34:46.433
- A bad outcome that's planned
is a bad plan.

34:46.500 --> 34:49.600
- Knowing that I would
change one problem

34:49.633 --> 34:51.266
and gain another problem,

34:51.333 --> 34:52.667
I'm happy with the idea

34:52.734 --> 34:54.667
of not getting
my breasts larger.

34:54.734 --> 34:57.200
- If I could wave
a magic wand over you,

34:57.233 --> 34:59.667
you'd get the sense not to do
anything to your breasts

34:59.734 --> 35:02.066
and maybe get
better taste in men.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.333
- I'm in the middle
of you two right now.

35:05.367 --> 35:07.066
Do you feel it?
- Oh, I do.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.066
It's like an animal magnetism.
- It is.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.333
- You're gonna have to break out
your shotgun or something.

35:11.367 --> 35:12.600
This would be, like,
the smallest bear

35:12.633 --> 35:14.533
you ever caught, though, huh?

35:14.600 --> 35:17.200
- I mean, it's tough being this
ridiculously good-looking--

35:17.233 --> 35:19.400
something that Terry
knows nothing about.

35:19.467 --> 35:22.333
- So, since you guys
can't help me with surgery,

35:22.367 --> 35:25.166
maybe you could take me
on a date later?

35:25.233 --> 35:27.700
- Aw. I can't do that, 'cause
we're your doctors still.

35:27.767 --> 35:29.633
But thank you very much
for the compliment.

35:29.667 --> 35:31.100
- Great pleasure
meeting you guys.

35:31.133 --> 35:32.233

35:35.266 --> 35:36.500
- Oh, we got to

35:36.533 --> 35:38.433
do something with that, right?

35:38.500 --> 35:41.400
- No. Don't pull that.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.233
Today I'm meeting
with Dr. Nassif

35:43.266 --> 35:44.567
for my day-one check-in.

35:44.633 --> 35:49.367
I feel a little tired,
but I am loving

35:49.400 --> 35:52.233
the pain meds
they've given me.

35:53.400 --> 35:56.433
- There he is.
How are you?

35:56.500 --> 35:58.667
- Group hug,
but gently, gently, gently.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.367
Today is Kelli's
day-one check-in

36:00.400 --> 36:02.166
to make sure
she's healing okay

36:02.233 --> 36:05.533
and that the nasal tip skin
is healthy.

36:05.567 --> 36:08.400
So, before I talk
about the surgery,

36:08.433 --> 36:10.133
I want to look at your nose.

36:10.166 --> 36:11.400
Let me look at your nose.

36:11.433 --> 36:14.333
Okay, so I was worried
about the possibility

36:14.400 --> 36:17.367
that the skin right here
could die...

36:17.433 --> 36:19.266
because making an incision
a little higher

36:19.300 --> 36:20.400
than where
you originally had it

36:20.433 --> 36:22.133
was that risk
of the blood supply

36:22.166 --> 36:23.333
not being great.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.266
It looks fantastic.
- Yay.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.333
- As of now,
Kelli's nose looks great.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.700
However, we have to make sure

36:28.734 --> 36:32.467
that everything heals
in the best way possible.

36:32.533 --> 36:34.266
You didn't wake up.
- That's good.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.533
- You didn't get off the table.
- Right.

36:35.567 --> 36:37.533
I had no clue all that time
had passed.

36:37.567 --> 36:39.133
- That's the way it should be.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.433
- I do not remember anything

36:40.467 --> 36:42.400
that Dr. Nassif
was talking about.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.300
All I remember

36:44.333 --> 36:48.166
is Dr. Nassif has restored
my faith in surgery.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.166
Thank you, Dr. Nassif.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.633
Thank you so much.
- See you guys next week.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.567
- Thank you, Doctor.
- My pleasure.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.600

life changing for me, really.

I think everything's gonna
turn out great.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.533

37:16.600 --> 37:18.433
Yesterday after waking up

37:18.467 --> 37:20.166
and even going back
to the hotel,

37:20.200 --> 37:22.433
I did not feel
any type of pops.

37:22.467 --> 37:24.667
Everything felt like
it's where it should be.

37:26.467 --> 37:27.734
- Much better
than last time around.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.600
- Okay. We made an incision,
opened everything up.

37:30.633 --> 37:33.467
You have what we call
a "presumptive diagnosis"

37:33.500 --> 37:35.333
of nerve entrapment.
- Okay.

37:35.367 --> 37:36.333
- Which you really don't see,
'cause that's

37:36.367 --> 37:37.333
on a microscopic level.
- Okay.

37:37.367 --> 37:38.500
- So lifting everything up

37:38.533 --> 37:39.633
hopefully will
take care of that.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.000
- Okay.
- When I've done this

37:41.066 --> 37:42.734
in the past,
more times than I can count,

37:42.767 --> 37:45.333
it's almost always
fixed the problem.

37:45.367 --> 37:46.333
- Okay.

37:46.367 --> 37:47.734
I have a little bit of fear

37:47.767 --> 37:49.734
because they couldn't
figure that out.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.734
But like he said,
lifting the skin up

37:51.767 --> 37:54.433
should reset those nerves,
so I should be good.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.767
- Normally, when you have
a separation of the muscle--

37:57.000 --> 37:58.367
- Yeah.
- In someone who's had

37:58.400 --> 38:00.200
a pregnancy or two--
it's about this.

38:00.233 --> 38:01.467
It's about 10 centimeters.
- Okay.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.767
- When you go back
on a revision tummy tuck

38:04.000 --> 38:05.600
and you still have
a separation,

38:05.633 --> 38:07.467
It's never 10 centimeters.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.200
She had, like, 12.
- Oh, jeez.

38:09.233 --> 38:10.633
- So maybe it just
never got done.

38:10.667 --> 38:12.233
- No, it was done,
'cause you could see

38:12.266 --> 38:13.633
the stitches had unraveled.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.367
- Yeah, that's right.
You thought you popped.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.667
- Yes, 'cause I sneezed.
- Right.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.533
- I knew right
from the beginning

38:18.567 --> 38:19.767
that that pop did something.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.500
So I feel validated
that Dr. Dubrow

38:21.533 --> 38:23.367
took me in and listened to me.

38:23.400 --> 38:26.533
And he said...definitely it was
popped, it was separated.

38:26.567 --> 38:28.333
- What was
very interesting, though,

38:28.400 --> 38:31.600
is because the lower muscle's
repair was still intact,

38:31.667 --> 38:34.200
it was, like, acting as
a belt here,

38:34.266 --> 38:36.767
compressing here,
pushing this out.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.066
And then the shelf-y area
was interesting because

38:40.133 --> 38:42.066
part of it was due to your...
- Bony, yeah.

38:42.133 --> 38:45.000
- Bony, asymmetry,
and it was very scarred down.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.500
So along the creasing here,

38:47.533 --> 38:49.533
I basically tucked it
up into the crease.

38:49.567 --> 38:51.633
So let's see
what it looks like.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.533
I'm really happy with the way
Kristina's surgery went.

38:53.567 --> 38:56.033
Now we'll just have to wait
to see how well she heals.

38:56.066 --> 38:58.400
She has a little swelling here,
but that's from the liposuction.

38:58.433 --> 39:00.533
This is the area
you worry about.

39:00.567 --> 39:02.300
- Okay.
- And you can see,

39:02.333 --> 39:05.266
it looks like the blood supply
is delivering oxygen,

39:05.300 --> 39:06.533
and it looks happy as a clam.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.266
- Absolutely fantastic.
- Yeah, I think--

39:08.300 --> 39:09.700
- Thank you.
- You nailed it, my friend.

39:09.734 --> 39:11.667
- Well, I mean, you've got
a long recovery to go through,

39:11.700 --> 39:13.533
but right now we're in
a good place.

39:13.567 --> 39:16.266
- I'm very excited
that Dr. Dubrow was able

39:16.300 --> 39:18.700
to correct what went wrong
the first time around.

39:18.734 --> 39:20.567
I felt like I was definitely
in good hands.

39:20.600 --> 39:24.000
Just no more sneezing.
both: No more sneezing.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.400
- This whole experience has been
life changing for me, really.

39:32.433 --> 39:35.600
Since my surgery, I've been
100% back to my old self,

39:35.633 --> 39:38.400
with confidence
I have not had before.

39:38.467 --> 39:40.433
- So do you guys want
to challenge Mommy to any games?

39:40.467 --> 39:41.700
- Yeah.

39:41.734 --> 39:43.433
What game
are you gonna challenge her to?

39:43.467 --> 39:44.667
- Hula-Hoop.
- I don't know.

39:44.734 --> 39:46.333
I bet Mama's
pretty good at Hula-Hoop.

39:46.367 --> 39:47.533
- So am I.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.433
- Today's so special for me

39:49.467 --> 39:51.600
because I get to show Joe
and show the kids

39:51.633 --> 39:54.700
Mommy's back
and better than ever.

39:54.734 --> 39:57.033
Hey, guys!
- Hi. Mommy.

39:57.066 --> 39:58.433
Look, I brought snacks.

39:58.467 --> 40:01.000
How are you?
- Good.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.433
- Did you guys
set this up for me?

40:02.467 --> 40:03.667
- Uh...
- You guys did a good job.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.300
Do I look pretty good?
- Yeah.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.433
- You look fantastic.

40:07.533 --> 40:08.600
- My self-confidence
is definitely boosted.

40:08.667 --> 40:12.333
I am able to wear more tighter,
form-fitting clothes.

40:12.367 --> 40:14.700
I look in the mirror,
and I'm thrilled to see myself.

40:14.734 --> 40:16.066
So how crazy that I can wear

40:16.100 --> 40:17.567
this kind of clothes again,
right?

40:17.633 --> 40:19.033
- They look fantastic on you.
- Thank you.

40:19.100 --> 40:20.500
- I feel good.

40:20.533 --> 40:23.367
Before my surgery,
I had this bulge

40:23.400 --> 40:26.066
on the top of my stomach,
and it looked like a huge chunk

40:26.100 --> 40:28.033
had been scooped out
of my right side.

40:28.100 --> 40:30.467
Now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
my stomach is flat,

40:30.500 --> 40:33.033
and I have curves
in all the right places.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.667
You ready? Go!

40:35.734 --> 40:37.333
- This one's way too big.

40:37.367 --> 40:39.033
I have no pain.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.433
Not one bit of pain anymore,
which is awesome.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.600
- Got any outfits
you've already picked out?

40:43.633 --> 40:46.633
- Maybe. You're gonna have to
just wait and see.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.700
I did--Oh! Oh!
- Jeez.

40:48.767 --> 40:50.734
- I'm sorry, Ni.
Are you okay?

40:50.767 --> 40:52.500
I have nothing holding me back.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.767
And as a parent, I feel like
I'm a better parent.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.600
I can't change
what happened in the past.

40:56.633 --> 40:58.767
I can't change the time
I lost with the kids

40:59.000 --> 41:00.200
But now I can make up
for all of that.

41:00.266 --> 41:01.767
And I feel like
super mom again.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.767
And it just makes me feel good.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.100
After we're done eating, I'm
gonna get those potato sacks,

41:06.133 --> 41:07.400
and I'm gonna beat you
in a sack race.

41:07.433 --> 41:09.066
I'm gonna win.
You didn't think

41:09.133 --> 41:10.767
I'd win Hula-Hoop, and I did.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.100
- I won.

41:12.133 --> 41:13.767
- Yeah.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.667
- I am ready
to take these pictures.

41:19.700 --> 41:22.367
I am excited.
I know I can take any angle.

42:03.533 --> 42:07.433
- Today is just as big a deal
for Darnel as it is for me.

42:07.467 --> 42:11.100
Walking up to see him reminds
me of our blind date

42:11.166 --> 42:14.467
And it's like he's seeing me
for the first time again today.

42:14.533 --> 42:19.433
♪ ♪

42:19.467 --> 42:20.633
- Wow.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.100
- Oh, wow.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.767
You look amazing!
Look at you.

42:26.033 --> 42:27.533
You're so beautiful.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.500
Dr. Nassif is a genius.

42:29.567 --> 42:32.500
Her inner beauty is coming
through in her smile.

42:32.567 --> 42:33.567
You look like a model.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.500
Absolutely.
- Thank you, babe.

42:35.567 --> 42:37.367
I am ready
to take these pictures.

42:37.433 --> 42:40.600
I am excited.
I know I can take any angle.

42:40.633 --> 42:43.000
Before my surgery,
my nose was turnt up.

42:43.066 --> 42:46.000
You could see up my nostrils,
and I felt really ugly.

42:46.066 --> 42:48.033
But now my nasal woes are over.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.000
And the only thing
that's gonna be turnt up

42:50.066 --> 42:51.467
is my wedding reception.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.600
- Maybe twirl your
future bride around.

42:53.633 --> 42:56.033
- Sure.
- Yeah.

42:56.066 --> 42:58.500
- Dr. Nassif was amazing.

42:58.567 --> 42:59.633
He took great care of me.

43:00.734 --> 43:01.667
I didn't get up
in the middle of my surgery

43:02.734 --> 43:04.667
to go look at my nose
in the mirror, opened up.

43:04.734 --> 43:08.000
I'm happy. I'm so happy because
I am the beautiful bride.

43:08.066 --> 43:10.033
They look so good.

43:10.100 --> 43:15.433
Oh, my God. I don't want
to delete not one of them.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.000
- The scar tissue formed.

43:17.066 --> 43:18.734
It sucked the lower portion

43:18.767 --> 43:20.533
of the breast tissue in.
- Right.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.100
- I've had this issue
for 12 years.

43:22.133 --> 43:23.667
You would think by this time,

43:23.734 --> 43:26.500
I would be able to be over it,
but it's hard.

43:26.533 --> 43:29.000
- I am determined
to look like Ivanka Trump.

43:29.066 --> 43:30.433
- Tiffany is already great.

43:30.500 --> 43:33.567
Tiffany doesn't need
to be made great again.

43:33.633 --> 43:35.066
- What is involved here

43:35.100 --> 43:36.734
is pretty much stripping
down everything.

43:36.767 --> 43:38.567
We may be Marlene's last chance

43:38.633 --> 43:40.633
of fixing her nose
before it collapses.
