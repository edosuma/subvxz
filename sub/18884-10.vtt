- Yeah, what'’s up with the wigs?
Making fun of me?

08:52.034 --> 08:54.827
- Bango slacker costumes,
free when you buy a case.

08:54.827 --> 08:56.758
- Oh, that'’s dope.
I gotta get one thing.

08:56.758 --> 08:58.413
- Oh, hey, man.
- Hey.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.413
- You want--I got an extra.
- Dude, you gotta wear

09:00.413 --> 09:03.034
one of those.
This guy is our party gawd!

09:03.034 --> 09:05.172
[all shouting]

09:05.172 --> 09:08.310
- Okay, yeah, I don'’t really
believe in a supreme being.

09:08.310 --> 09:11.379
I'’m, uh...I guess you could say
I'’m more of a...

09:11.379 --> 09:12.965
eighth-eist.

09:12.965 --> 09:14.586
- Oh, like weed!
[all shouting]

09:14.586 --> 09:16.379
- I didn'’t get it at first,
but now that I do,

09:16.379 --> 09:17.931
I'’m in, like,
a way better place emotionally.

09:17.931 --> 09:20.655
- Yo, hit this, dude.
- Okay, I mean...

09:20.655 --> 09:22.379
first time for everything,
right?

09:22.379 --> 09:24.862
- Oh, yeah, hit that shit, bro.
- Hit it, bro!

09:24.862 --> 09:28.000
- Yeah, two hands. Two hands.
- Like a little piccolo!

09:28.000 --> 09:30.758
- [gagging]
[all laughing]

09:30.758 --> 09:33.586
- See this guy?
[all cheering]

09:33.586 --> 09:36.965
- Yeah, hey, who wants to see me
jump off this freakin'’ roof?

09:36.965 --> 09:39.689
- Oh, I do!
[all cheering]

09:39.689 --> 09:41.689
- Dude!
- I do as well!

09:41.689 --> 09:43.689
- Yeah, I'’m gonna. It'’s, like,
actually a really great way

09:43.689 --> 09:45.586
to get the attention
over to you.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.206
Everybody starts talking about
you at the party, it'’s cool.

09:47.206 --> 09:48.931
- You know what?
I love people talking about me.

09:48.931 --> 09:50.241
- We should do it.
- I'’m there. I'’m done.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.931
- We'’re going.
- Are you guys--

09:51.931 --> 09:53.310
- Well, that'’s sort of my thing.
- Let'’s do this.

09:53.310 --> 09:55.586
- No, no!
That'’s my thing, guys!

09:55.586 --> 09:59.000
No, you--you can'’t!
That'’s my thing!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.413
[all cheering]
That'’s my thing!

10:00.413 --> 10:02.344
I'’m gonna do it too!
Break a leg!

10:02.344 --> 10:04.482
- No, only one person can do it.
Wait, jump--that'’s my thing!

10:04.482 --> 10:05.620
[leg snaps]

10:05.620 --> 10:07.310
[all gasping]

10:07.310 --> 10:08.793
- [screaming]

10:08.793 --> 10:10.379
- Dude, are you okay?

10:10.379 --> 10:13.344
- So bad!
Hey, hey!

10:13.344 --> 10:16.034
It'’s nothing a little weed
won'’t fix, right?

10:16.034 --> 10:17.862
- I don'’t know.

10:17.862 --> 10:20.931
- Later, skaters! These guys
are actual skateboarders.

10:20.931 --> 10:25.482
- Actual skaters, baby!
- Skaters, baby, yeah.

10:25.482 --> 10:28.068
- Good morning.
Dope party, fellas.

10:28.068 --> 10:31.241
I'’m so proud of you.
Bango is flying off the shelves.

10:31.241 --> 10:33.379
You guys are off
the Richter scale.

10:33.379 --> 10:35.275
Death toll in the hundreds.
- [hisses]

10:35.275 --> 10:37.724
- Thank you so much for saying
that--that means a lot.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.586
- Yeah, man,
it was awesome, but hey.

10:39.586 --> 10:42.034
I got a couple creative ideas
to run past you, all right?

10:42.034 --> 10:43.724
- Sure.
- So I was thinking maybe

10:43.724 --> 10:45.241
we could do, like,
theme parties, right?

10:45.241 --> 10:46.862
Like, everybody dresses up
like clowns

10:46.862 --> 10:48.379
or, like, post-apocalyptic.

10:48.379 --> 10:50.896
Something like way out there
and crazy, right.

10:50.896 --> 10:52.379
- Yeah.
- We at Bango believe

10:52.379 --> 10:54.068
that the most "out there" thing
we can do

10:54.068 --> 10:56.586
is to keep doing the same thing
over and over again.

10:56.586 --> 10:57.793
- Yep.
- Okay.

10:57.793 --> 11:00.758
- But on a webseries.

11:00.758 --> 11:02.689
- Are we talking business?
- Yeah.

11:02.689 --> 11:04.793
- Isaac. Okay, good.

11:04.793 --> 11:07.068
- Isaac Lubetkin,
Adam'’s manager.

11:07.068 --> 11:08.206
- [no audible dialogue]
- This webseries.

11:08.206 --> 11:09.896
Are we talking a rev-share?

11:09.896 --> 11:11.758
Because that'’s a thing
I'’ve at least overheard

11:11.758 --> 11:14.724
is a word for stuff.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:14.724 --> 11:18.034
Gentlemen, we'’ve built a brand.

11:18.034 --> 11:21.034
Now we build an empire.
- An empire!

11:21.034 --> 11:22.551
Fu--yeah, I was just
saying that.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.034
That'’s also one of
my favorite shows.

11:24.034 --> 11:25.793
- We build a set,
we hire extras.

11:25.793 --> 11:28.793
We shoot four scripted parties a
day in a controlled environment

11:28.793 --> 11:32.655
and then we drop a new party
episode online every Friday

11:32.655 --> 11:36.655
and the kids can party
with the dudes world wiz-ide.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.551
On the world wide wiz-eb.
- What?

11:39.551 --> 11:41.724
- We are gold
until we drop season two

11:41.724 --> 11:43.310
and that'’s when the money
starts rolling in.

11:43.310 --> 11:45.137
- [laughing]
- Okay, yeah!

11:45.137 --> 11:47.068
- Hang on, hang on,
hang on, okay?

11:47.068 --> 11:49.310
'’Cause my client'’s not just
gonna keep working

11:49.310 --> 11:51.793
for a hat split three ways.
- Yep.

11:51.793 --> 11:54.482
- Those days are over,
Kurt, baby.

11:54.482 --> 11:57.172
My guy right here...
- My guy.

11:57.172 --> 12:02.275
- He is willing to work
for three hats split one way.

12:02.275 --> 12:05.517
- I think I can get you one hat.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.758
- Hang on. Pst.

12:11.275 --> 12:12.793
- Yeah, baby.

12:12.793 --> 12:14.034
- We can work with that.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.517
- Ders, Ders, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.344
You'’re drinking
out of a garbage can, man.

12:17.344 --> 12:18.827
- It'’s a garbage cup.

12:18.827 --> 12:20.517
- ♪ He'’s insane ♪

12:24.586 --> 12:26.689
- The ff--
[bell rings]

12:26.689 --> 12:28.586
- All right, everybody,
let'’s clear the set.

12:28.586 --> 12:30.379
We'’re rolling in five.

12:30.379 --> 12:32.620
- Hello?

12:32.620 --> 12:36.448
Hello? Am I supposed to be doing
something, going somewhere?

12:36.448 --> 12:37.862
- Yeah, I got eyes on Blake.

12:37.862 --> 12:39.655
Morning, Blake, they need you
in hair and makeup

12:39.655 --> 12:41.137
before you meet with
the stunt coordinator.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.068
- What? No, no.
I can'’t do any stunts.

12:43.068 --> 12:45.448
I got some email from Isaac
yesterday.

12:45.448 --> 12:47.620
Evidently, stunts are
exclusive to Adam.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.965
- That is correct, but
we'’re still going back and forth

12:49.965 --> 12:52.758
on Adam'’s contract,
and honestly,

12:52.758 --> 12:56.620
your hair is testing better
than Adam'’s dimples.

12:56.620 --> 13:00.137
Yeah, so we think this is
the best move for "Party Gawds."

13:00.137 --> 13:02.206
- [stammers]
I don'’t know.

13:02.206 --> 13:04.896
Why don'’t you just let
Ders do it or something?

13:04.896 --> 13:06.965
- He'’s not in the best
of condition.

13:06.965 --> 13:09.000
- Hey.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.310
What do you say we go back
to my dressing room,

13:11.310 --> 13:12.896
strip you down to nothing
but that belt

13:12.896 --> 13:14.689
and fuck like
the world'’s about to end?

13:14.689 --> 13:17.896
- Excuse me?
- Oh, I was just running lines.

13:21.137 --> 13:23.517
- Okay, yo, whoa!
What the hell is that?

13:23.517 --> 13:24.827
- It'’s a weave.

13:24.827 --> 13:27.344
Kurt wanted to amp up
your look.

13:27.344 --> 13:29.482
Make it bigger.
Way bigger.

13:29.482 --> 13:31.068
- Okay, no, that'’s insane.

13:31.068 --> 13:33.206
I look like a Mortal Kombat
character.

13:33.206 --> 13:35.689
- I think you look cool.
Johnny Cage cool.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.517
- Uh...what are
you doing here, man?

13:38.517 --> 13:40.068
- Oh, I'’m here to watch, man.

13:40.068 --> 13:41.482
Bango hooked me up
with a set visit

13:41.482 --> 13:42.793
instead of paying
my medical bills.

13:42.793 --> 13:44.586
Pretty sick, right?

13:44.586 --> 13:46.827
Tight butthole.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

13:46.827 --> 13:50.068
Um, so, uh...when are you gonna
be walking again?

13:50.068 --> 13:52.482
Like, a week or a month?
- Oh, never.

13:52.482 --> 13:54.172
But it'’s cool, man.
You know, I get to tell people

13:54.172 --> 13:57.344
that Blake Henderson saw me
get paralyzed!

13:57.344 --> 13:59.758
- I'’m so jealous.
- I hate my legs now.

13:59.758 --> 14:02.758
- Stop! Stop!
Take the weave somewhere.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.482
- Yeah, his hair'’s perfect.
He doesn'’t need it.

14:04.482 --> 14:06.586
- You guys, no,
it'’s gone too far, all right?

14:06.586 --> 14:08.413
You have to stop.
Listen to me.

14:08.413 --> 14:12.275
The partying, the clothes,
the hair.

14:12.275 --> 14:15.448
I mean, come on!
It'’s just hair, man.

14:15.448 --> 14:18.965
It'’s dead fingernails
or something like fingernails--

14:18.965 --> 14:20.620
like, but on your head,
like a horn,

14:20.620 --> 14:24.620
like a rhino'’s horn, which is
also hair, I think...

14:24.620 --> 14:27.482
- Don'’t say that.
- No, dude.

14:27.482 --> 14:30.896
Okay, no.
All right, you need to see this.

14:30.896 --> 14:32.551
- No.
- What are you doing?

14:32.551 --> 14:34.068
- It'’s just hair, man.
It doesn'’t...

14:34.068 --> 14:36.758
mean anything.
It'’s not who I am, all right?

14:36.758 --> 14:38.448
- No, no!
- Please, hey, dude!

14:38.448 --> 14:40.448
[all screaming]
- I'’m doing it!

14:40.448 --> 14:42.655
- Don'’t! No, no, no!
- It'’s just hair.

14:42.655 --> 14:44.896
Shut up! I'’m doing it!
- Please!

14:44.896 --> 14:46.931
[all screaming]

14:46.931 --> 14:49.758
[somber music]
- No!

14:49.758 --> 14:51.551
Why?

14:51.551 --> 14:53.724
- It'’s not me.
It'’s just hair.

14:53.724 --> 14:56.655
[clippers whirring]

14:59.448 --> 15:01.793
- Ahh! All right.

15:01.793 --> 15:04.620
Now that that'’s gone,
whom is your party gawd now?

15:04.620 --> 15:06.344
- You still look incredible.

15:06.344 --> 15:08.344
- Hey. Losers.

15:08.344 --> 15:10.965
I'’ll be your god.
- Ah-ah! Please don'’t.

15:10.965 --> 15:13.275
- Oh, fine, fine! Take it!

15:13.275 --> 15:15.482
- Dude, there'’s no booze
anywhere on set.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.206
Okay, this stuff?
This stuff, I was like,

15:17.206 --> 15:19.241
"Oh, here we go, let'’s party.
Nope, nonalcoholic.

15:19.241 --> 15:21.896
It'’s all fake.
It'’s all fake! Nothing'’s real!

15:21.896 --> 15:23.517
I don'’t know
what'’s real anymore.

15:23.517 --> 15:25.655
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Okay, Ders will be fine.

15:25.655 --> 15:27.034
We'’ll get him some water,
some rest, I'’ll take care--

15:27.034 --> 15:28.724
- What happened
to your goddamn hair?

15:28.724 --> 15:30.965
- It'’s gone, okay? I'’m sorry.
- Ohh...

15:30.965 --> 15:33.620
- No, no, no, no, '’cause I'’m
sick of being used, all right?

15:33.620 --> 15:36.551
I'’m a human being!
I'’m not a goddamn action figure!

15:36.551 --> 15:38.103
- Step back!
- Action figure?

15:38.103 --> 15:39.482
I like the sound of that.

15:39.482 --> 15:42.344
Isaac, let'’s do action figures,
right?

15:42.344 --> 15:43.655
- Done.

15:43.655 --> 15:45.137
- Instead of DeMamp
Muff Diver'’s Kit.

15:45.137 --> 15:46.862
- Yeah, which was, by the way,
a terrible idea.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.482
- I still like it, though.
- Yeah.

15:48.482 --> 15:50.172
And that'’s why
we'’re still doing it.

15:50.172 --> 15:51.689
- Okay, Goons,
turkey bacon shake?

15:51.689 --> 15:52.931
- Turkey bacon shakin'’,
baby doggy.

15:52.931 --> 15:54.620
- Thank you, baby doggy.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.482
- Kurt, I got great news, okay?
Contract is signed.

15:58.482 --> 16:01.862
That means my boy Adam
is ready to crush

16:01.862 --> 16:04.172
this opening stunt,
all right?

16:04.172 --> 16:06.620
Only deal is, he'’s gotta be
in Slim Jim.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.551
All right,
everything Slim Jim, Kurt.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.827
Top to bottom, it'’s gotta be
Slim Jim, okay?

16:11.827 --> 16:14.103
- Blake'’s doing the stunt.

16:14.103 --> 16:18.448
- You backstabbing,
hairy asshole.

16:18.448 --> 16:21.000
- Adam, I'’m not doing the stunt,
all right?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.586
- [gasps] Your brand!

16:23.586 --> 16:25.379
- I don'’t care about the brands,
Adam, stop.

16:25.379 --> 16:27.758
- After all the exposure
that I'’ve given us

16:27.758 --> 16:30.586
with my SoCal Helpful Honda
center radio spot audition,

16:30.586 --> 16:33.206
potential forthcoming callback?
- Okay, the what?

16:33.206 --> 16:34.689
- All right,
I'’m doing the stunt.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.551
- Excuse me.
It'’s my show.

16:36.551 --> 16:38.379
You'’re not doing the stunt.

16:38.379 --> 16:41.448
- Well, newsflash, sir.
Neither am I.

16:41.448 --> 16:43.034
- Fine!
- I'’m doing it!

16:43.034 --> 16:45.896
- I'’ll do the stunt.
- No, I want to.

16:45.896 --> 16:47.724
- I ain'’t afraid to die.
- No one asked him.

16:47.724 --> 16:50.172
He doesn'’t even have a brand.
- Jager!

16:50.172 --> 16:51.793
- He doesn'’t even have a brand--

16:51.793 --> 16:53.103
[electricity crackles]
- Whoa!

16:53.103 --> 16:55.551
- Oh, shit!
- That wasn'’t the stunt.

16:55.551 --> 16:58.241
There'’s a whole thing with
a Vespa and some Silly String.

16:58.241 --> 17:01.068
- Oh, my God, Ders!

17:01.068 --> 17:02.965
Did you do this to spite me?

17:02.965 --> 17:04.689
- I was just trying
to kill myself.
