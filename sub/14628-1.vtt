05:06.925 --> 05:08.008
Hey, kid!

06:01.471 --> 06:03.179
Hey, Ismael.
Catch!

07:21.685 --> 07:24.435
Such a pleasure to see you,
Herr Lieberman.

07:24.435 --> 07:29.310
The pleasure is all mine,
Herr Strasser, I assure you.

07:29.310 --> 07:33.102
I hate to bother such a famous
Nazi hunter, like yourself,

07:33.102 --> 07:36.853
with such trifle as the rent,
but it is the third of the month.

07:37.519 --> 07:42.061
Quite so, you will have a cheque
in several days.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.436
By all means, take your time,
Herr Lieberman.

07:46.978 --> 07:49.562
Feel free to ignore
your responsibilities,

07:49.562 --> 07:52.520
while my property is being ruined.

07:52.604 --> 07:55.645
We have floods all over the building,
because of you.

07:56.104 --> 08:00.395
You overload the floor putting
a strain on the pipes upstairs,

08:01.229 --> 08:02.563
and then they break.

08:03.438 --> 08:06.980
The pipes upstairs break,
and I'm to blame?

08:07.646 --> 08:09.438
Everything is connected.

08:10.063 --> 08:12.855
The whole building will soon
collapse because of you.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.813
- Ezra!
- Get out!

08:14.813 --> 08:17.856
- You have no right...
- You have a call from Paraguay.

08:17.856 --> 08:21.397
This is an apartment house,
not an office building.

08:21.397 --> 08:25.147
You have no right to bring in
these heavy cabbinets in here.

08:25.231 --> 08:26.439
All right, all right.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.689
So next time rent to
a feather merchant.

08:28.897 --> 08:29.397
Hello.

08:29.689 --> 08:30.732
Mr. Lieberman?

08:30.857 --> 08:33.732
- Out! You understand!
- You get out!

08:33.732 --> 08:35.690
Go and fix your rotten plumbing.

08:36.023 --> 08:40.023
Barry Kohler? No, I don't think
I know you.

08:40.023 --> 08:41.732
I sent you a package with photos.

08:42.898 --> 08:43.773
You didn't?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.941
You sound like an American.

08:46.274 --> 08:48.566
<i>What are you doing in Paraguay?</i>

08:49.108 --> 08:51.649
I've been monitoring the activities
of a group of Nazis.

08:54.024 --> 08:56.566
And I've identify several of them
as war criminals.

08:58.609 --> 09:00.192
Well, from your books and articles.

09:00.192 --> 09:03.984
Forty years of heartbreak and
sacrifice and you call it junk!

09:03.984 --> 09:05.192
Yes, junk! Junk, junk!

09:05.192 --> 09:08.442
Herr Strasser, we are wasting
valuable time.

09:08.442 --> 09:09.942
The hole up there is very
enormous.

09:10.067 --> 09:13.568
Huge chunks of plaster are coming
down from your ceiling.

09:13.568 --> 09:15.443
Look, how I step on the ground.

09:15.443 --> 09:17.901
Quite soon I will be through
into your apartment,

09:17.901 --> 09:21.943
right into the lap of your beloved
wife. God forbid.

09:22.276 --> 09:23.776
- Come.
- Don't push me.

09:23.776 --> 09:26.611
Leave my brother and me alone.
Get out!

09:29.861 --> 09:31.527
Come, Herr Strasser.

09:46.528 --> 09:49.737
Esther, the man's an idiot.

09:49.737 --> 09:53.195
No, I'm an idiot for letting him
make me angry.

09:53.195 --> 09:55.738
- Go on, take your phone call.
- Oh!

09:56.446 --> 10:00.779
The young man who's just discovered
there are Nazis in South America.

10:02.654 --> 10:06.946
So, Mr. Kohler, forgive
the interruption.

10:09.030 --> 10:11.280
I work alone like you,
Mr. Lieberman,

10:11.905 --> 10:14.864
which is why I'm calling you.
You see, I'm onto something.

10:15.322 --> 10:19.864
Mr. Kohler, it maybe a blinding
revelation to you,

10:19.864 --> 10:21.572
that there are Nazis in Paraguay,

10:21.572 --> 10:24.656
but I assure you, it is
no news to me.

10:24.656 --> 10:30.198
And if you stay there much longer,
there will still be Naziss in Paraguay,

10:30.198 --> 10:33.698
but there will be one less Jewish
boy in the world.

10:33.990 --> 10:35.323
Something's going on.

10:36.031 --> 10:38.449
They seemed to be gathered
for some kind of operation.

10:38.532 --> 10:41.741
A bunch of them have been moving
in and out of Ralph Gunther's estate.

10:44.574 --> 10:46.157
I want to know what to do next.

10:46.324 --> 10:50.032
Get on a plane and go home, or better
still go to the American Embassy,

10:50.032 --> 10:54.075
run to the American Embassy and
tell them to put you on the plane.

10:55.533 --> 10:56.867
Thank you for your advice.

11:03.658 --> 11:04.868
What did he want?

11:05.326 --> 11:06.534
I don't know.

11:07.451 --> 11:09.201
Advise, instructions.

11:10.451 --> 11:15.368
A boy like that. Lucky to survive
one day in Paraguay!

11:16.951 --> 11:19.202
He's been there some weeks.

11:19.202 --> 11:21.410
I told him to go home, anyhow.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.660
What does he want, applause?

11:27.160 --> 11:30.452
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

11:31.035 --> 11:34.911
One, two, three, four.

11:35.536 --> 11:37.578
One, two.

11:37.870 --> 11:39.953
- One, two.
<i>- One, two.</i>

11:39.953 --> 11:42.328
- Goddamn, it works!
<i>- Goddamn, it works!</i>

14:07.339 --> 14:09.756
Come on, damn you, tune in.

14:10.172 --> 14:12.089
Gentlemen, he's coming.

14:29.590 --> 14:30.965
So, Gunther,

14:31.548 --> 14:33.173
this is the moment.

14:48.967 --> 14:52.759
Gentlemen, gentlemen, be
at your ease, I beg of you.

14:54.925 --> 14:57.967
<i>- Gunther, would you do the honours?</i>
<i>- Certainly, Dr. Mengele.</i>

14:58.467 --> 14:59.509
Mengele.

15:00.217 --> 15:01.550
Captain Gerhart Mundt.

15:01.550 --> 15:06.135
Yes, yes, I have heard nothing but
the highest praise for you, captain.

15:06.135 --> 15:07.426
Thank you, Herr Doctor.

15:12.010 --> 15:15.510
- Major Ludwig Trausteiner.
- Thank you for coming, Major.

15:17.969 --> 15:19.344
- Captain...
- All right, Gunther.

15:19.344 --> 15:22.802
Captain Farnbach and I are
old comrades.

15:22.886 --> 15:24.427
Are we not, captain?

15:24.719 --> 15:28.552
It is extremely flattering to be
remembered after all those years, sir.

15:28.552 --> 15:33.553
I am not so senile, or so ungrateful
that I cannot remember a loyal officer

15:33.553 --> 15:36.220
from the early days of the struggle.

15:38.220 --> 15:40.053
And now for the youth.

15:40.637 --> 15:42.762
This is Dietrich Hessen,
son of Wilhelm Hessen.

15:42.762 --> 15:44.053
Welcome, young man.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.346
- Wolfgang Kleist.
- I am pleased you are with us.

15:49.346 --> 15:50.429
Thank you, Herr Doktor.

15:54.179 --> 15:57.346
- And Otto Schwimmer.
- A great pleasure, Herr Schwimmer.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.223
And now to business.

16:16.890 --> 16:19.056
Sit down, gentlemen, please.

16:36.391 --> 16:40.432
<i>The task before you</i>
<i>is the most important operation</i>

16:40.432 --> 16:43.725
<i>that the Kamerades organization</i>
<i>has ever undertaken.</i>

16:44.350 --> 16:47.183
It is the vital link in a programme

16:47.183 --> 16:52.475
to which I and your leaders have
devoted many years of huge effort.

16:53.017 --> 16:57.309
Your success on this project
carries with it the hope

16:57.309 --> 16:59.809
and destiny of the Aryan race.

17:00.476 --> 17:04.393
And that is not an exageration,
but the literal truth.

17:05.184 --> 17:07.101
It is a holy mission, gentlemen.

17:08.559 --> 17:11.060
You should consider yourselves
highly honoured

17:11.894 --> 17:13.810
to have been chosen
to perform it.

17:20.185 --> 17:21.769
Now for the details.

17:24.645 --> 17:27.560
In the next two-an-half years,
ninety-four men

17:27.560 --> 17:30.978
must die on or near certain dates.

17:32.603 --> 17:35.603
Sixteen of these men are
in West Germany,

17:35.895 --> 17:39.479
fourteen in Sweden,
thirteen in England,

17:39.771 --> 17:43.729
twelve in the United States,
ten in Norway,

17:43.729 --> 17:46.062
nine in Austria,
eight in Holland,

17:46.062 --> 17:49.354
and six each in Denmark
and Canada.

17:51.855 --> 17:54.147
A total of ninety-four

17:55.230 --> 17:56.480
assassinations.

18:05.231 --> 18:06.023
All of these men

18:06.023 --> 18:10.273
<i>will be sixty-five years old</i>
<i>when their dates come around.</i>

18:10.273 --> 18:14.648
<i>Obviously, a few of them will already</i>
<i>have died of natural causes.</i>

18:15.939 --> 18:17.273
Yes, Farnbach.

18:17.439 --> 18:19.899
Who are these men?
Jews?

18:21.315 --> 18:22.607
Not one.

18:23.565 --> 18:26.940
They are all family men,
tax inspectors,

18:26.940 --> 18:29.899
civil servants, school principals,
men of minor authority.

18:30.732 --> 18:32.857
<i>Are we permitted to hire</i>
<i>accomplices?</i>

18:33.190 --> 18:35.733
<i>Accomplices?</i>
<i>I would not advise it.</i>

18:35.733 --> 18:39.275
<i>Bear it in mind, these are</i>
<i>sixty-five year old men.</i>

18:39.275 --> 18:44.733
<i>Their eyesight is failing, they have</i>
<i>slow reflexes, diminished strength.</i>

18:46.108 --> 18:48.484
I've been through Sweden
quite a bit,

18:48.484 --> 18:51.109
but I've never heard of this place,
Rasbo.

18:51.401 --> 18:56.317
It is a village. About fifteen
kilometres from Upsala.

18:57.984 --> 19:01.652
That is Bertile Hayden, the post
master, there.

19:02.152 --> 19:05.110
And by killing this old mail man

19:05.110 --> 19:09.027
I will be fulfilling the destiny
of the Aryan race?

19:12.110 --> 19:15.778
You wish to be relieved
of this assignment, captain Mundt?

19:17.236 --> 19:18.319
No, sir.

19:19.403 --> 19:21.819
Then, do not question your orders.

19:22.736 --> 19:24.153
Simply obey them.

19:25.403 --> 19:26.653
Yes, Herr Doktor.

19:27.653 --> 19:28.986
I apologise.

19:32.112 --> 19:33.404
Further questions?

19:44.030 --> 19:46.946
<i>The men's families are not</i>
<i>to be involved.</i>

19:47.821 --> 19:50.030
<i>And in the case of say younger</i>
<i>wives</i>

19:50.738 --> 19:55.696
<i>who might be open to romantic</i>
<i>overtures as accomplices.</i>

19:56.405 --> 20:00.614
<i>I repeat, the families are not</i>
<i>to be involved.</i>

20:01.156 --> 20:03.447
<i>You will travel and live in a manner</i>
<i>befitting</i>

20:03.447 --> 20:05.697
<i>salesmen, for large German firms.</i>

20:05.697 --> 20:10.197
You'll have more than enough money
for any equipment you might need.

20:11.322 --> 20:15.782
It is vital that you check in
with headquarters on the first...

20:25.157 --> 20:26.616
Find it!

20:28.991 --> 20:30.283
Find it!

21:22.328 --> 21:23.203
Sir!

21:42.371 --> 21:44.788
All right, Mr. Lieberman,
listen to this.

21:45.163 --> 21:47.079
<i>Killing this old mail man,</i>

21:47.079 --> 21:50.955
<i>I will be fulfulling the destiny</i>
<i>of the Aryan race?</i>

23:46.922 --> 23:48.838
Operator, any word of my call yet?

24:14.424 --> 24:15.299
Hello.

24:17.299 --> 24:18.424
Kohler!

24:19.299 --> 24:21.590
I thought I told you to leave.

24:21.590 --> 24:25.300
Well, I didn't Mr. Lieberman, but I think
you're going to be glad I didn't.

24:26.258 --> 24:29.716
Doktor Josef Mengele was here
tonight.

24:29.716 --> 24:33.508
You mean to tell me you've called
me up at 3 o'clock in the morning

24:33.508 --> 24:36.216
to tell me Doktor Josef Mengele
is in Paraguay?

24:36.216 --> 24:40.384
I know that, Mr. Kohler,
so does my sister,

24:40.384 --> 24:45.926
so does my landlord, and my tailor,
and now you know it too.

24:45.926 --> 24:46.967
My congratulations!

24:46.967 --> 24:49.426
He came to a meeting at Gunther's
house tonight.

24:49.592 --> 24:50.926
The others were there too.

24:51.884 --> 24:55.885
Mengele's sending them out to kill
ninety-four, sixty-five year old men

24:55.885 --> 24:57.718
in the next two-an-half years.

24:57.927 --> 25:00.343
What are you talking about?

25:02.802 --> 25:06.803
Ninety-four at sixty-five...

25:07.928 --> 25:10.011
two-an-half years.

25:11.261 --> 25:15.553
I can hear you, Mr. Kohler, I just
can't follow what you're saying.

25:19.386 --> 25:23.220
<i>Goddamn it, you don't have to</i>
<i>believe me, I've got it all on tape.</i>

25:24.012 --> 25:27.304
<i>All of them, Europe, Canada,</i>
<i>the United States.</i>

25:28.929 --> 25:30.262
Mostly civil servants.

25:41.930 --> 25:45.513
Okay, I'm running it down now.
It'll only take a second.

25:46.055 --> 25:51.806
Take your time, old men don't go back
to sleep once they've been awakened.

25:58.306 --> 26:02.057
<i>- Welcome, young man.</i>
- The stuff on now, it's just a lot of

26:02.057 --> 26:04.182
introducing and glad handing around.

26:04.973 --> 26:07.515
Mengele is acting like chairman
of the board.

26:09.057 --> 26:12.098
Will you stop asking questions
and just listen Mr. Lieberman?

26:14.807 --> 26:16.808
Okay, here it comes.

26:18.016 --> 26:20.266
<i>The task before you is</i>
<i>the most important...</i>

26:26.933 --> 26:27.683
Kohler!

26:31.350 --> 26:32.600
Are you there, Kohler?

26:33.225 --> 26:34.184
Kohler!

26:36.017 --> 26:38.142
<i>... your success on this project...</i>

26:46.893 --> 26:47.726
Kohler.

27:03.311 --> 27:04.477
Clean the room.

27:05.477 --> 27:06.977
Dispose of the body.

27:08.519 --> 27:12.353
I do not want a trace
of this vermin to remain.

27:24.770 --> 27:28.229
Everything is all right,
you can take care of the police.

27:28.229 --> 27:31.271
- Who was the boy calling?
- It does not matter.

27:31.646 --> 27:34.604
- Perhaps you should wait?
- We wait for nothing,

27:34.604 --> 27:36.979
the fourth Reich is coming, Gunther.

27:36.979 --> 27:39.563
Our men will leave tomorrow
as planned.

27:52.647 --> 27:53.689
Kill him.

28:07.190 --> 28:10.566
Is there no way of checking
this further?

28:13.024 --> 28:14.899
All right, thank you.

28:16.774 --> 28:20.982
The Vienna telephone exchange says
there was a call from Paraguay,

28:20.982 --> 28:23.775
but Paraguay say that no such call
took place.

28:25.233 --> 28:28.733
I have finally found a couple
of things from that boy.

28:33.817 --> 28:34.608
Mundt!

28:35.983 --> 28:38.734
Captain in a Death-Head Regiment.

28:39.068 --> 28:41.484
Farnbach, a Gestapo agent.

28:41.859 --> 28:45.693
Trausteiner! Assistant commandant,
at Dachau.

28:45.693 --> 28:48.651
Cheap bureaucrats and murderers.

28:48.734 --> 28:49.818
And these...

28:51.735 --> 28:52.860
who knows.

28:53.610 --> 28:56.944
- Ezra, you know, you shouldn't.
- Esther, Esther,

28:56.944 --> 29:00.527
after all I've been through,
one puff won't hurt me.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.403
These...

29:11.278 --> 29:15.986
Colonel Eduard Seibert, he's
the adjutant to Rausch,

29:15.986 --> 29:18.195
the head of the Kamerads
organization.

29:18.195 --> 29:23.737
He was in command of the
extermination units on the Eastern Front.

29:23.737 --> 29:25.321
He's a real aristocrat,

29:25.321 --> 29:29.154
what's he doing in such
undistinguished company?

29:29.321 --> 29:32.154
And then, it wasn't a hoax after all.

29:33.613 --> 29:34.238
Esther,

29:35.280 --> 29:37.988
on the telephone, after that boy
was cut off,

29:39.280 --> 29:41.363
I felt something...

29:42.113 --> 29:45.613
something in the silence,
something alive,

29:46.906 --> 29:47.739
and...

29:49.698 --> 29:50.906
hateful.

29:54.198 --> 29:56.364
Maybe, I'm getting senile.

29:57.156 --> 29:58.573
You haven't got the time.

30:03.615 --> 30:08.449
Ninety-four...
ordinary men.

30:30.576 --> 30:31.659
<i>Beynon!</i>

30:34.742 --> 30:36.076
Oh, Christ!

30:38.409 --> 30:41.909
Mr. Beynon, so nice to see you again.

30:42.535 --> 30:45.952
- How are you getting along?
- Can't complain, who'd listen.

30:46.160 --> 30:50.910
- May I take up a moment of your time?
- I'm so sorry, I'm late for lunch.

30:50.910 --> 30:54.202
Oh, always such a prodigious
appetite.

30:54.202 --> 30:54.868
What?

30:54.868 --> 30:57.119
Eight times last week I call you

30:57.119 --> 31:01.036
and each time you are at lunch.
Maybe you have a tate warm?

31:01.369 --> 31:05.786
Now, Sidney, please, just a few
moments of your time.

31:08.661 --> 31:10.286
Very well, come on.

31:11.579 --> 31:14.704
Ezra, you carry this whole
damn concentration camp thing

31:14.704 --> 31:16.120
pinned to your coat-tails.

31:17.162 --> 31:19.454
Why do you keep knocking
yourself out?

31:19.662 --> 31:21.370
Nothing ever pays off.

31:22.662 --> 31:24.621
Frieda Maloney is in jail.

31:24.621 --> 31:27.955
Frieda Maloney! She was
only a guard in a camp.

31:28.413 --> 31:31.330
She strangled young girls with
their own hair,

31:31.455 --> 31:34.705
bayonetted infants.
- Maybe she was a despicable criminal,

31:34.705 --> 31:37.246
but she just isn't news
thirty years later.

31:42.414 --> 31:46.706
Sidney, there is a plot by
the Kamerads Organization,

31:46.706 --> 31:48.206
which is the illegal army...

31:48.206 --> 31:49.456
Yes, I know what it is.

31:50.289 --> 31:54.998
They plan to kill ninety-four men
in the next two-an-half years.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.082
Jews, I suppose?

31:57.873 --> 32:02.082
I want your European, Canadian
and American bureaus

32:02.082 --> 32:03.415
to send you clippings

32:03.415 --> 32:09.041
of all sixty-five year old civil
servants who die accidentally.

32:09.416 --> 32:11.458
You pass them to me and
I'll go through them.

32:12.499 --> 32:14.374
And whose plot is this?

32:15.458 --> 32:16.791
Josef Mengele.

32:18.083 --> 32:20.333
He's the red herring
in this little barrel?

32:21.750 --> 32:25.584
What a title for the chief doctor
of Auschwitz

32:25.584 --> 32:28.334
who killed two-an-half million people,

32:28.334 --> 32:32.625
experimented on children, Jewish
and non-Jewish,

32:33.125 --> 32:38.501
using twins mostly, injecting
blue dyes into their eyes

32:38.501 --> 32:40.376
to make them acceptable Aryans.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.001
Ezra.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.793
Amputating limbs and organs
from thousands,

32:44.960 --> 32:50.461
operating without anaesthetic, but
with the strenght of Wagner

32:50.461 --> 32:55.794
providing an obligato to the screams
of the mutons he was creating.

32:55.794 --> 32:57.044
Don't lecture me!

32:59.002 --> 33:00.044
Sidney,

33:01.336 --> 33:03.212
you owe me something.

33:04.587 --> 33:07.753
Even if only to humour an old man

33:07.753 --> 33:11.503
who once brought you page
one international story.

33:12.170 --> 33:14.128
You owe me this much, Sidney.

33:15.087 --> 33:16.879
Now, I'm collecting.

33:23.171 --> 33:25.754
Have you any idea how many
men in their mid-sixties,

33:25.754 --> 33:26.879
die every day?

33:28.879 --> 33:30.629
I try not to think about it.

33:59.882 --> 34:02.091
Save it for your wife,
Herr Doring.

34:02.632 --> 34:04.674
What I've got is too good
for her.

34:04.674 --> 34:06.716
I can feel that, Herr Doring.

34:08.507 --> 34:09.591
Go on, go on.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.757
Pig.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.558
Good boy.

36:09.391 --> 36:10.641
Good boy.

37:49.857 --> 37:50.857
Seibert!

37:51.857 --> 37:52.898
News?

37:53.065 --> 37:56.315
Good news, our salesmen have
all checked in.

37:56.648 --> 38:00.358
The first quotas have been filled,
all on the exact dates.

38:00.899 --> 38:02.941
Two a day early and one
a day late.

38:02.941 --> 38:05.524
Splendid, splendid!
Come.

38:06.233 --> 38:07.899
We'll have a nice lunch.

38:33.193 --> 38:37.193
Colonel, I will need to have a full
report on all this for my records.

38:38.193 --> 38:40.277
I've already taken care of that.

38:52.236 --> 38:55.612
Four out of seven on the exact dates.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.112
They are good men.

38:59.028 --> 39:00.570
Well chosen.

39:00.570 --> 39:03.695
General Rausch called me
yesterday from the Costa Brava.

39:07.153 --> 39:09.321
Why didn't you tell us
about Lieberman?

39:14.321 --> 39:16.404
I did not think this was necessary.

39:17.154 --> 39:18.654
The General is concerned.

39:19.988 --> 39:23.989
But Ezra Lieberman,
no one takes him seriously.

39:24.405 --> 39:27.364
Even the rich Jews who used
to send him money,

39:27.364 --> 39:29.989
have found better ways
to ease their consciences.

39:29.989 --> 39:31.822
The man's bank has failed,

39:31.822 --> 39:33.947
his followers have fallen
away from him.

39:33.947 --> 39:39.281
He's entirely without credibility,
I just decided he was not important.

39:39.615 --> 39:42.990
If you'll forgive me, Herr Doktor,
it was not your decision to make.

39:43.573 --> 39:46.698
You could have compromised
their agents all over the world.

39:47.448 --> 39:49.824
And if I have told you
about Lieberman,

39:49.824 --> 39:52.991
you would have compromised
my project.

39:55.157 --> 39:59.241
How bad would it be if we postponed
for three or four months?

40:00.199 --> 40:03.408
That would reduce the outcome by...

40:03.825 --> 40:06.908
twenty percent, there are 18 men
in the first four months

40:06.908 --> 40:09.200
it would change the results
completely.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.033
Assuming that there is an outcome.

40:11.033 --> 40:14.242
There'll be exactly the results
I have promised.

40:15.283 --> 40:19.784
General Rausch wanted to recall
these six men.

40:19.784 --> 40:20.451
Impossible!

40:20.451 --> 40:22.784
Until we find out how much
Lieberman knows.

40:22.784 --> 40:26.243
Impossible, this project has
a timetable

40:26.243 --> 40:28.701
that muste be observed,
it cannot be changed.

40:28.701 --> 40:29.576
Herr Doktor...

40:29.576 --> 40:33.785
Colonel, do you fully understand
what it is that I have done?

40:34.160 --> 40:36.619
I, the outlaw,

40:37.410 --> 40:39.660
the so-called war criminal.

40:40.327 --> 40:42.994
Right here in this God-forsaken
place,

40:42.994 --> 40:45.327
I have created a scientific miracle.

40:46.120 --> 40:48.953
I have turned the whole world
into a laboratory.

40:48.953 --> 40:50.703
Our laboratory.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.536
Don't talk me about six men.

40:53.953 --> 40:56.578
I would send out six more
if they were caught,

40:56.578 --> 41:01.287
and six more, and six more,
until the task was done.

41:01.287 --> 41:03.371
I agree, Herr Doktor, I agree.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.871
I hope that we can resolve
this Lieberman business,

41:06.871 --> 41:12.746
and that you get to put 94 check
marks on that beautiful chart of yours.

41:13.580 --> 41:14.497
Come.

41:15.372 --> 41:16.705
Walk me to the plane.

41:20.122 --> 41:24.372
You see how passionate I am
on this subject.

41:24.372 --> 41:25.288
Uh huh!

41:25.997 --> 41:28.498
To think that one day this place
will be a shrine

41:28.498 --> 41:30.873
to be visited by millions
of school-children.

41:32.081 --> 41:36.289
Yes, that is a nice thought.
Yes, Doktor.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.168
Gladbeck, three-thirty, Ezra.

42:31.168 --> 42:35.168
We'll get there, we'll get there,
when do I ever miss a train?

42:35.377 --> 42:38.836
Now you know what to do
while I'm away?

42:38.836 --> 42:42.669
Go through all those clippings,
separate them by countries, cities,

42:43.003 --> 42:45.711
try to isolate all violent crime.

42:45.878 --> 42:49.211
Ezra, there are already more than
a hundred clippings

42:49.211 --> 42:51.294
and Beynon called to say there are
more to come.

42:51.503 --> 42:53.545
Well, we have to start somewhere.

42:54.212 --> 42:57.920
Yes, yes, but we can't afford to hunt
for all those men.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.337
Well, that's why I'm going
to these cities first,

43:00.337 --> 43:04.504
because they are the closest
and the cheapest, it's the begining.

43:04.504 --> 43:05.880
Yes, but you know that...

43:05.963 --> 43:09.671
Remember to separate the ones
in New England from the rest.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.921
I can cover them while I'm
on the lecture tour.

43:12.796 --> 43:14.671
Still, without any help.

43:15.380 --> 43:19.338
Without help, without money,
without time, what else is new?

44:18.926 --> 44:20.051
The landlord!

44:21.843 --> 44:23.010
Where are you going?

44:23.010 --> 44:26.176
- To turn that damn tape off.
- Leave it, I like music.

44:27.093 --> 44:28.551
Well, he doesn't.

44:29.844 --> 44:32.511
He'll prowl round the landing
listening at my door,

44:32.511 --> 44:35.511
- just waiting to catch me.
- Catch you? Doing what?

44:35.719 --> 44:37.552
Just what we're doing now, love.

44:37.802 --> 44:40.761
Mr. Harrington doesn't like
any mucking-around in his house,

44:40.761 --> 44:43.636
he has a wife and kid, you know.
Old coot!

44:43.636 --> 44:45.803
Bet he wouldn't say no
if I invited him in here.

44:49.595 --> 44:51.095
Then maybe we'll invite him in.

44:52.678 --> 44:53.678
Later.

45:18.347 --> 45:21.680
Is this Frau Doring's residence?
My name is Lieberman.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.390
Good.

45:38.223 --> 45:40.557
I think she's off the phone by now.

45:41.349 --> 45:43.224
You're her grandson?

45:44.141 --> 45:45.141
Her son.

45:52.307 --> 45:53.766
Herr Lieberman!

45:56.433 --> 46:00.142
Frau Doring, thank you so much
for seeing me.

46:00.767 --> 46:02.767
Won't you sit down?

46:02.767 --> 46:03.767
Thank you.

46:13.309 --> 46:17.684
You are the same man they had
on television, several months ago.

46:18.143 --> 46:20.976
The Nazi hunter.
Frieda Maloney.

46:23.644 --> 46:25.769
Do you kill Nazis when
you catch them?

46:26.352 --> 46:29.810
That's against the law, it's
much better to put them on trial

46:29.810 --> 46:32.435
- so people can learn.
- Learn what?

46:34.060 --> 46:36.936
Who they were, what they did.

46:37.436 --> 46:39.103
So why even catch them?

46:39.978 --> 46:42.020
Just put it all in history books.

46:45.561 --> 46:48.020
Clever boy you have here,
Frau Doring.

46:48.478 --> 46:51.521
Yes, but definitely lazy.

46:52.396 --> 46:57.271
For example, right now he should
be in his room practising.

46:57.271 --> 47:01.479
I can't be in my room and answer
the door at the same time, can I?

47:01.479 --> 47:04.605
Oh! I was only teasing, darling.

47:06.688 --> 47:10.480
Now, please go and practise.

47:31.023 --> 47:33.232
Now we can talk.

47:33.899 --> 47:37.524
First of all, may I express
my sympathy,

47:37.524 --> 47:41.440
things must be very difficult
for you right now.

47:42.107 --> 47:43.107
Thank you.

47:44.524 --> 47:46.775
Is he your only child?

47:47.733 --> 47:48.608
Yes.

47:49.108 --> 47:53.900
Did your husband leave all his money
to Erich and you?

47:53.900 --> 47:55.775
And to a sister of his.

47:56.525 --> 47:57.983
Why do you ask that?

47:58.983 --> 48:02.734
I was looking for a reason
behind his death.

48:03.359 --> 48:05.526
Emil's death was an accident.

48:06.901 --> 48:08.401
Was he a Nazi?

48:08.651 --> 48:13.442
I did not meet him until 1955,
so I have no way of knowing.

48:14.151 --> 48:20.068
Did he ever mention the name
of a Doktor Josef Mengele?

48:20.485 --> 48:21.277
Who?

48:22.027 --> 48:26.652
There was a considerable age
difference between you two.

48:27.193 --> 48:29.278
That wasn't the only difference.

48:30.028 --> 48:33.069
I was twenty, straight off the farm

48:33.069 --> 48:36.569
and he was Mr. High-an-Mighty
of the Transport Commission.

48:37.694 --> 48:39.986
Forty-three, I think he was.

48:41.528 --> 48:46.070
- Did he have any hobbies?
- No.

48:49.695 --> 48:50.529
Yes.

48:51.320 --> 48:55.070
Yes, he did have one special hobby,
Herr Lieberman.

48:55.904 --> 49:00.155
He humiliated and beat my son
at every given opportunity.

49:02.113 --> 49:05.238
Would you like me to tell you
who really killed him?

49:06.821 --> 49:07.946
God.

49:08.571 --> 49:14.031
To set free a stupid little farm girl after
twenty-two years of unhappiness.

49:15.572 --> 49:18.447
Do Nazis answer prayers,
Herr Lieberman?

49:19.156 --> 49:20.156
No.

49:20.364 --> 49:22.239
That is God's business.

49:23.156 --> 49:25.740
And I have thanked him every night,

49:25.740 --> 49:30.657
since he pushed Emil
under that car.

49:33.115 --> 49:34.865
He could have done it sooner.

49:35.948 --> 49:37.948
But I thank him anyway.

50:20.410 --> 50:22.369
Who the hell are you?

50:22.786 --> 50:25.994
Come in, Mr. Harrington.
She wants to talk to you.

50:27.119 --> 50:28.619
I'll talk to her.

50:29.952 --> 50:30.994
That would be nice.

50:48.162 --> 50:49.079
John!

50:50.371 --> 50:51.246
John!

50:54.371 --> 50:57.621
Simon, stop playing with those puppets
and go and wash your hands for tea.

50:57.621 --> 51:00.288
- Hallo.
<i>- I'm on my way, mother.</i>

51:01.413 --> 51:03.247
If you'll hold on, I'll just get her.

51:05.622 --> 51:06.664
<i>Nancy!</i>

51:07.414 --> 51:10.164
<i>Nancy! Telephone, Nancy.</i>

51:12.122 --> 51:13.580
Nancy!

51:13.580 --> 51:14.705
<i>Nancy!</i>

51:15.622 --> 51:16.623
Nancy!

51:17.123 --> 51:18.165
<i>Nancy!</i>

51:18.165 --> 51:20.790
Come on, Nancy, you can't spend
your life in bed.

51:30.999 --> 51:32.041
Nancy!

52:03.584 --> 52:07.418
Good, good, incredibly precise.

52:09.501 --> 52:11.834
Everything right on schedule.

52:12.126 --> 52:15.502
You didn't have to make the trip,
Seibert, you could have used the radio.

52:15.752 --> 52:19.627
Not that I do not welcome a little
intelligent company down here.

52:20.002 --> 52:23.627
Gunther remembered the digital
clock you admired so much

52:23.627 --> 52:24.877
in his home.

52:26.335 --> 52:28.711
Well, thank you, my friend.

52:30.461 --> 52:31.711
Very nice of you.

52:34.545 --> 52:36.586
Such a rational device.

52:37.295 --> 52:39.628
- Remarkable.
- There is a problem.

52:41.629 --> 52:42.546
Lieberman.

52:43.004 --> 52:45.254
He was in Gladbeck,
in Doring's house.

52:51.004 --> 52:53.421
Possibly he found out about Doring.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.255
You don't know?

52:56.005 --> 52:57.130
How could I?

52:57.463 --> 53:00.338
- The boy, Kohler?
- Impossible.

53:01.047 --> 53:03.505
Then, how did Lieberman
get to Doring?

53:05.505 --> 53:06.963
Sheer coincidence.

53:07.463 --> 53:11.381
That's not a very scientific
explanation, is it, Doktor?

53:11.964 --> 53:15.298
Are you interrogating me,
colonel Seibert?

53:16.006 --> 53:19.089
General Rausch put me in charge of
security for this project.

53:19.964 --> 53:22.298
How can I function, if I don't have
all the facts?

53:22.298 --> 53:23.549
But you do!

53:23.757 --> 53:28.549
A nosey, incompetent, old Jew
has bumbled onto one victim,

53:28.799 --> 53:30.799
what more do you have to know?

53:31.257 --> 53:35.632
Any idiot could see the next
logical step. Kill him!

53:35.799 --> 53:37.883
We don't want to create a martyr.

53:38.008 --> 53:38.841
Ridiculous!

53:38.841 --> 53:42.008
Besides, he could have contacted
various police agencies,

53:42.383 --> 53:44.008
or intelligence services.

53:44.008 --> 53:46.341
They would not pay any attention
to him.

53:46.758 --> 53:49.675
If he died suddenly, they would.

53:50.216 --> 53:51.217
Well.

53:52.342 --> 53:54.967
Then, what are you going to do?

53:55.967 --> 53:58.759
Lieberman will have to be watched
more carefully from now on.

53:58.759 --> 54:01.842
If he seems to be getting closer
to us, a decision will be made.

54:02.134 --> 54:05.802
We will balance the danger
of killing Lieberman

54:05.802 --> 54:09.010
against the scientific validity
of your project.

54:09.343 --> 54:12.968
Are you, my esteemed
Chief of Security

54:12.968 --> 54:18.302
telling me that a project twenty years
and millions of dollars in the making,

54:18.302 --> 54:22.011
will be dropped because of
this insignificant impudent, old Jew?

54:22.469 --> 54:25.261
It wouldn't do to antagonize me,
Doktor Mengele.

54:25.511 --> 54:27.428
I've been one of your few supporters,

54:27.428 --> 54:29.219
since this Lieberman business
began.

54:29.678 --> 54:33.887
And should I drop to my knees
in gratitude?

54:35.262 --> 54:36.470
Listen to me, Seibert,

54:36.929 --> 54:41.720
I will not permit you to lay your
failure, or your fear at my door.

54:41.720 --> 54:44.554
I am a scientist, I have done my job.

54:45.012 --> 54:46.930
You are an executioner!

54:47.638 --> 54:48.930
Do yours!

55:16.557 --> 55:17.682
Ezra!

55:26.098 --> 55:28.598
Oh! A reception committee.

55:29.016 --> 55:30.183
How nice.

55:30.516 --> 55:31.808
So, how did it go?

55:32.724 --> 55:34.849
A very rewarding trip.

55:34.849 --> 55:36.891
The Krassner death at Freiburn

55:36.891 --> 55:40.516
was a genuine accident witnessed
by many people.

55:40.933 --> 55:44.059
At Gladbeck, I met a young
housewife

55:44.059 --> 55:48.434
who was not exactly heart broken
by the death of her old husband.

55:48.809 --> 55:52.642
And at Prozheim they slammed
the door in my face.

55:52.892 --> 55:55.892
That's the way it will probably be
with most of these people.

55:55.892 --> 55:58.643
- I know, come, let's get a coffee.
- Yes, please.

56:05.768 --> 56:07.393
Excuse me, Mr. Lieberman?

56:08.601 --> 56:10.143
My name is David Bennett.

56:10.143 --> 56:12.936
I think you know a friend of mine,
Barry Kohler.

56:13.686 --> 56:17.769
- Are you the boy who's been calling?
- What news of Mr. Kohler?

56:18.019 --> 56:18.852
None.

56:21.436 --> 56:24.269
- I know he was working with you.
- That's not correct.

56:24.894 --> 56:27.478
- Well, he was in contact with you.
- How do you know that?

56:27.687 --> 56:29.978
- From letters we received.
- We?

56:31.145 --> 56:32.937
The Young Jewish Defenders.

56:32.937 --> 56:36.937
They're a bunch of fanatics.
Kohler told me he worked alone.

56:36.937 --> 56:38.728
Yes, and he did, thanks to you.

56:39.104 --> 56:42.021
After he read all your books,
he decided to change his methods.

56:43.229 --> 56:46.104
I did not send your friend to Paraguay.

56:46.688 --> 56:48.271
He sent me these.

56:49.146 --> 56:51.813
To prove that he wasn't off
on some wild goose-chase.

56:52.604 --> 56:55.355
He couldn't identify these three
young guys, so I traced them.

56:55.355 --> 56:59.022
This is Kleist, Hessen,
this is Schwimmer,

56:59.980 --> 57:02.730
members of a neo-Nazi organization
in Paraguay.

57:03.105 --> 57:05.480
This has nothing to do with me.

57:06.189 --> 57:08.815
Does Barry Kohler's life have
anything to do with you?

57:08.815 --> 57:12.065
- You have no right to talk that way.
- Is Barry Kohler still alive?

57:12.065 --> 57:15.481
- How do I know?
- Mr. Lieberman, Barry is dead.

57:16.148 --> 57:17.273
You know that.

57:17.815 --> 57:20.148
And I know that.
And that's why I'm here.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.357
To pick up where he left off.

57:22.649 --> 57:23.774
That means with you.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.774
I work alone.

57:26.107 --> 57:28.232
Im' not asking you for a job,

57:28.482 --> 57:30.441
I simply want some information
from you.

57:30.441 --> 57:32.232
I can't help you.

57:32.774 --> 57:35.192
I won't leave you until
you talk to me.

57:35.192 --> 57:37.275
I'm going to plant myself
on your doostep,

57:37.275 --> 57:39.442
and I'll be waiting for you there
every morning.

57:39.733 --> 57:42.692
You're stuck with me, until you
give me the information that I need.

57:43.525 --> 57:44.358
Ezra,

57:44.817 --> 57:48.025
I got another envelope of clippings
from Beynon.

57:48.317 --> 57:49.818
A big one.

57:53.609 --> 57:55.401
All right, young man.

57:56.318 --> 57:57.401
We'll talk.

58:50.405 --> 58:51.363
Good morning.

58:51.822 --> 58:54.197
I'm looking for the village of Storein.

58:55.322 --> 58:56.947
You're going the wrong way.

58:57.197 --> 59:00.948
Turn around and take the south road
for about sixteen kilometres,

59:01.406 --> 59:03.114
then bear right, you can't miss it.

59:03.489 --> 59:06.073
- Thanks.
- What are you doing in these parts?

59:07.073 --> 59:09.323
- What?
- You are not Swedish.

59:13.615 --> 59:16.365
I come from Don'tmund originally,
but,

59:17.407 --> 59:19.449
I live in Stockholm now.

59:21.615 --> 59:24.282
I have spent some time in Germany
myself.

59:27.658 --> 59:31.075
Come now, Mundt!
What's happened to your memory?

59:31.408 --> 59:34.575
My God!
Major Hartung!

59:37.450 --> 59:39.325
<i>I knew it was you!</i>

59:39.325 --> 59:42.659
<i>Can't I believe it! What in the world</i>
<i>are you doing up here?</i>

59:43.992 --> 59:46.909
Well, it's no great story,
my sister was married to a Swede.

59:47.492 --> 59:50.867
And after I escaped from the
internment camp, I hid out with them.

59:51.201 --> 59:54.784
I am Lars Lofquist now, Inspector
of the Power Company.

59:54.784 --> 59:55.910
And now what about you?

59:56.285 --> 01:00:00.160
I came up here on a job, for
the Comrades Organization.

01:00:00.827 --> 01:00:01.993
In Sweden?

01:00:02.785 --> 01:00:04.160
My God, what's going on?

01:00:05.243 --> 01:00:07.535
Can you tell me or would it
violate orders?

01:00:07.535 --> 01:00:09.828
What the hell with orders,
I'm sick of orders.

01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:19.744
I'm up here in Storein to kill
a school-teacher, on Saturday.

01:00:19.994 --> 01:00:23.203
But don't ask me why, I cannot
make head or tail of it.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:26.287
Who is this teacher?
Lundberg? Olafsson?

01:00:27.579 --> 01:00:28.662
Lundberg.

01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:31.870
But I don't know what he looks like.

01:00:32.037 --> 01:00:35.954
No doubt, he's probably a harmless
old man, it doesn't make any sense!

01:00:35.954 --> 01:00:37.663
It makes sense to your superiors

01:00:38.246 --> 01:00:40.246
or they wouldn't have given you
the assignment.

01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:42.038
An order is an order.

01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:46.246
Good God, man! You are
an officer of the S. S!

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.163
Have you forgotten?

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:50.663
My honour is loyalty.

01:00:50.996 --> 01:00:53.872
Those words were supposed
to be engraved on your soul.

01:00:56.997 --> 01:00:58.289
I know Lundberg.

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:00.164
I will point him out to you.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:09.082
It isn't Lundberg.

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:27.416
And it doesn't have to be Saturday.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.709
No one would have wanted
to kill Jack.

01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:42.584
The man was beloved.

01:01:43.459 --> 01:01:47.084
If you had seen the wreaths
his students sent...

01:01:48.668 --> 01:01:51.918
I have only one or two more
questions to ask.

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:57.085
Did your husband belong
to any international group?

01:02:00.126 --> 01:02:02.252
He was in the American Legion.

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:04.086
Rotary.

01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:07.294
I guess that's international.

01:02:07.961 --> 01:02:10.877
The Legion sent a Colour Guard
to the funeral.

01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:14.169
The coffin was drapped
in the American flag.

01:02:18.545 --> 01:02:20.170
What are you doing out of bed?

01:02:20.545 --> 01:02:23.212
I just came to get a glass
of grapefruit juice.

01:02:25.087 --> 01:02:29.545
He's got the flu, also I thought he could
stay home a few days because of it.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.296
This is Jack Curry Jr.

01:02:33.379 --> 01:02:35.629
Just Jack Curry, now.

01:02:36.379 --> 01:02:39.713
Jack, you bite your tongue.
This is Mr. Lieberman.

01:02:39.838 --> 01:02:42.963
A famous man from Vienna
in Austria.

01:02:43.129 --> 01:02:45.880
- What's he famous for?
- This is fantastic!

01:02:47.172 --> 01:02:49.464
You know you have a double.

01:02:50.214 --> 01:02:54.755
A boy who lives in Gladbeck
in Germany, exactly like you.

01:02:55.047 --> 01:02:56.422
Exactly like me?

01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:58.673
I never saw anything like it.

01:02:59.465 --> 01:03:01.798
Two twin brothers could not
be more the same.

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:05.465
Jack, you go up to bed, and
I'll bring you the juice.

01:03:05.923 --> 01:03:08.256
- I want to find out about...
- You do what I tell you!

01:03:08.256 --> 01:03:11.090
When you start paying the doctor bills,
then you can hang around

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:13.549
and get sick all you want, now just
say goodbye and go.

01:03:14.132 --> 01:03:16.257
Jesus Christ!
Goodbye.

01:03:17.174 --> 01:03:18.882
You watch your mouth, young man!

01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:22.424
It's amazing!

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:25.591
I thought he was this young boy
from Germany

01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:27.217
come to visit you.

01:03:27.217 --> 01:03:30.300
Even the voice, the look in the eyes.
Exactly.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.842
Look, I don't want to be rude, but as
you can see, I got a lot of things to do.

01:03:36.675 --> 01:03:40.134
Look, I'm sure that nobody shot
Big Jack on purpose.

01:03:40.593 --> 01:03:42.801
It was a horrible accident.

01:03:42.801 --> 01:03:43.968
If you'll excuse me.

01:03:54.719 --> 01:03:56.510
Hello, is this the Harrington residence?

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.635
Yes, this is the Harrington residence.

01:03:59.594 --> 01:04:01.385
Can I talk to your mother, please?

01:04:01.677 --> 01:04:03.427
Well, you could, but you can't.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.635
This will only take a moment,
I promise you.

01:04:05.802 --> 01:04:07.803
My mother isn't receiving today.

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.761
Well, perhaps if you told her that I...

01:04:10.761 --> 01:04:13.178
Don't you understand English,
you ass?

01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:15.386
We are not at home.

01:04:21.636 --> 01:04:23.762
Wilcox had two married daughters.

01:04:25.054 --> 01:04:26.387
No, no sons.

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:29.596
The Harringstons, do they have
any children?

01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:32.762
What did the boy look like?

01:04:32.762 --> 01:04:37.263
Sort of pale, he had straight
dark hair, very dark,

01:04:37.888 --> 01:04:38.680
blue eyes.

01:04:41.388 --> 01:04:42.972
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

01:04:43.805 --> 01:04:46.222
Why do you want to know about
the kids all of a sudden?

01:04:46.222 --> 01:04:47.763
Listen, Mr. Bennett,

01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:52.473
if you want to ask the questions,
you pay for the phone call.

01:04:54.723 --> 01:04:55.473
No,

01:04:56.473 --> 01:04:57.389
nothing.

01:04:58.348 --> 01:05:00.764
No, I haven't found a link.

01:05:02.014 --> 01:05:04.390
No, I'm in the dark.

01:05:04.682 --> 01:05:06.932
Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow,
I promise.

01:05:16.099 --> 01:05:16.974
<i>Coming.</i>

01:05:20.308 --> 01:05:22.475
I have to speak to you,
Mr. Lieberman.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.266
Well, come in. I was just coming
to see you.

01:05:27.975 --> 01:05:31.100
- Sit down.
- No, I can't stay long.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.142
Jack Jr. Doesn't know
where I've gone.

01:05:35.142 --> 01:05:36.392
Mr. Lieberman,

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:40.392
my son is the only thing I've got.

01:05:41.392 --> 01:05:45.017
- You can't take him away from me.
- I have no intention of...

01:05:45.017 --> 01:05:47.852
When you spoke about that boy
in Germany, I got worried.

01:05:48.352 --> 01:05:51.852
The lady who gave Jack Jr. To us,
made us swear never to tell anyone.

01:05:52.768 --> 01:05:57.560
- Your son's adopted?
- It's just that... she was a German lady.

01:05:58.102 --> 01:05:59.893
She was very nice, really.

01:06:00.394 --> 01:06:02.728
I was amazed when I read
in the papers,

01:06:02.728 --> 01:06:04.644
about all the things you said she did.

01:06:06.811 --> 01:06:08.269
Frieda Maloney.

01:06:08.811 --> 01:06:10.019
Oh, God!

01:06:10.894 --> 01:06:12.853
I knew I should never have come here.

01:06:29.813 --> 01:06:31.980
Will you give me your word
that you do not have

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.813
any recording device
in your briefcase?

01:06:38.063 --> 01:06:38.938
Thank you.

01:06:51.981 --> 01:06:53.647
Do you have the depositions?

01:06:53.939 --> 01:06:55.147
I have brought one.

01:06:57.273 --> 01:07:00.190
The agreement was that you
would provide an advance look

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.190
at all the testimonies against
my client.

01:07:02.732 --> 01:07:06.523
With particular regard to any scars,
deformities, or disabilities,

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.982
suffered by the witnessses.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:10.274
Here. The deposition is brought
in good faith.

01:07:11.149 --> 01:07:15.983
Two others will come if the interview
should prove satisfactory.

01:07:16.316 --> 01:07:18.358
You realise how unjust all this is.

01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:23.066
Mrs. Maloney has been married
to an American citizen for 27 years.

01:07:24.066 --> 01:07:27.025
She has two children,
one grandchild.

01:07:36.525 --> 01:07:37.942
I suppose this can be...

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.360
corroborated?

01:07:41.735 --> 01:07:45.610
By the mother of the child and
three other surviving witnesses.

01:08:00.319 --> 01:08:02.277
You will keep the interview brief.

01:08:04.152 --> 01:08:06.945
You will discuss only my client's
activities in America

01:08:06.945 --> 01:08:09.112
between 1964 and '67.

01:08:11.278 --> 01:08:14.278
You will ask nothing about
the charges against her

01:08:14.278 --> 01:08:17.653
or about any event that ocurred
during, or directly after the war.

01:08:18.737 --> 01:08:25.404
One question of that nature and I will
immediately terminate the interview.

01:09:30.826 --> 01:09:31.951
So.

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:36.783
I am to speak to you about my work
with the adoption agency.

01:09:36.783 --> 01:09:39.076
- That is correct.
- I don't mind.

01:09:40.326 --> 01:09:43.033
What I did may have been
slightly illegal, but,

01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:47.368
I brought happiness to so many people
and that's was important, huh?

01:09:48.368 --> 01:09:50.035
Now tell me, if you will,

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:53.285
how you came to work
for this agency?

01:09:57.535 --> 01:10:01.453
In the spring of 1963 I was contacted
by someone

01:10:01.453 --> 01:10:03.786
I knew in the Comrades
Organization.

01:10:03.953 --> 01:10:04.828
Who?

01:10:05.036 --> 01:10:06.995
Frau Maloney will not answer that.

01:10:08.745 --> 01:10:10.536
They helped me after the war

01:10:10.536 --> 01:10:12.120
and wanted me to return the favour

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.829
by getting a job in an adoption agency.

01:10:15.871 --> 01:10:17.287
Did they say why?

01:10:17.579 --> 01:10:19.787
If you let me finish,
you'll find out.

01:10:23.329 --> 01:10:25.871
The Rush-Gaddis agency hired me.

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.955
The Comrades Organization was
interested in rejects.

01:10:30.288 --> 01:10:33.830
Couples who had been denied children,
because the husband was too old.

01:10:34.622 --> 01:10:37.205
I was to go through the files
looking for applications,

01:10:37.205 --> 01:10:40.748
specifically those of families
with Nordic-Christian backgrounds,

01:10:41.456 --> 01:10:45.289
in which the husband was born
between 1910 and 1914

01:10:45.289 --> 01:10:49.206
and the wife between 1933 and 1937.

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:53.623
The husband had to have a job
in something like civil service

01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:57.457
and both spouses had to be
in perfect physical health.

01:10:57.707 --> 01:11:00.624
Did they say why they wanted
all this?

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.832
That information is not relevant.

01:11:02.832 --> 01:11:06.124
I was expected to obey my orders,
not to question them.

01:11:07.415 --> 01:11:10.416
This I did.
As I always had.

01:11:11.791 --> 01:11:14.791
About a year after that
I was ordered to contact

01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:19.041
several of the applicants and
offer them a healthy white baby boy,

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.541
complete with New York State
adoption papers.

01:11:22.041 --> 01:11:23.917
They were to pay me
five hundred dollars

01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:27.042
and after their medical certificates
had been cleared,

01:11:27.042 --> 01:11:28.792
they would receive the babies.

01:11:29.292 --> 01:11:32.834
We would meet at a motel
near Kennedy Airport,

01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:35.334
that used to be Idelwild.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.293
The babies were delivered to me

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:41.085
usually by stewardesses
with Varig Airlines.

01:11:41.335 --> 01:11:42.210
Varig?

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:46.168
Did the babies all come from Brazil?

01:11:47.418 --> 01:11:49.918
- Is that important to you?
- No.

01:11:51.503 --> 01:11:53.128
What did they look like?

01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:55.794
They were all beautiful little boys,

01:11:56.003 --> 01:11:59.669
black hair, piercing blue eyes.

01:12:00.836 --> 01:12:04.920
If you're looking for a long lost Jewish
grandson, he was not among them.

01:12:08.129 --> 01:12:10.545
How many couples did you give
the babies to?

01:12:11.545 --> 01:12:12.837
About twenty.

01:12:12.837 --> 01:12:14.212
Only Americans?

01:12:14.879 --> 01:12:17.129
- Some were Canadian.
- No Europeans?

01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:17.879
No.

01:12:18.295 --> 01:12:21.213
Can you remember a Curry family?

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:23.880
- Curry? Yes.
- Who else?

01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:26.130
Wheelock.

01:12:26.963 --> 01:12:28.213
Henry Wheelock.

01:12:29.588 --> 01:12:31.588
He gave me my dog Schatzie.

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:34.422
Beautiful Doberman.

01:12:34.881 --> 01:12:37.464
It was only ten weeks old
when I got him.

01:12:38.214 --> 01:12:40.256
Where is Wheelock from?

01:12:41.006 --> 01:12:42.756
New Providence, Pennsylvania.

01:12:43.797 --> 01:12:46.422
And how long after the Currys,

01:12:46.422 --> 01:12:48.507
did the Wheelocks get their baby?

01:12:48.507 --> 01:12:51.132
That's fourteen years ago,
I don't remember.

01:12:54.132 --> 01:12:57.715
And what has Josef Mengele
to do with all this?

01:12:57.882 --> 01:12:59.257
We won't answer that.

01:12:59.423 --> 01:13:01.424
It was all a trick, wasn't it?

01:13:02.424 --> 01:13:04.299
I know nothing of Mengele,

01:13:05.091 --> 01:13:07.091
but you'll link me with him,
won't you?

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:09.716
You want your pound of flesh,
you don't care how yuo get it!

01:13:10.049 --> 01:13:12.799
Thirty years!
The world has forgotten!

01:13:13.174 --> 01:13:14.424
Nobody cares!

01:13:14.925 --> 01:13:17.467
And you persist!
And persist!

01:13:17.467 --> 01:13:19.134
Now, why don't you get off my back?

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:26.592
- One more minor question.
- I'll say nothing to you.

01:13:27.134 --> 01:13:28.259
As you wish.

01:13:31.218 --> 01:13:34.093
This interview has not gone by any
means to my satisfaction

01:13:34.093 --> 01:13:38.593
I will therefore withold the other two
depositions we talked about.

01:13:38.593 --> 01:13:41.051
You lying Jewish schwein!

01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:44.761
You're not a guard now, Madame!

01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:48.052
You are a prisoner!

01:13:49.344 --> 01:13:52.927
I may leave here empty-handed,

01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:55.511
but you

01:13:56.386 --> 01:13:59.762
are not going anywhere.

01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:07.553
I think Frau Maloney could answer
one more question.

01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:16.471
When is your dog's birthday?

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:22.054
You are an insane old man
after all, aren't you?

01:14:22.804 --> 01:14:27.305
Schatzie's birthday? It was
December eleventh.

01:14:31.014 --> 01:14:32.930
<i>Have a safe trip, David.</i>

01:14:33.555 --> 01:14:34.555
Why?

01:14:35.014 --> 01:14:35.930
<i>Bye, bye.</i>

01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:37.389
...Mengele?

01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:42.765
That was David, he's off to New
York for his sister's wedding,

01:14:42.765 --> 01:14:44.515
but he'll be back in a week.

01:14:46.848 --> 01:14:47.931
Mengele...

01:14:49.806 --> 01:14:51.181
gives babies,

01:14:52.056 --> 01:14:55.932
fourteen years later he kills
the fathers,

01:14:56.182 --> 01:14:59.932
he kills Doring, Harrington,
Curry.

01:14:59.932 --> 01:15:03.057
And the Currys got their baby
four weeks apart

01:15:03.057 --> 01:15:06.266
and the fathers were killed four
weeks apart.

01:15:09.725 --> 01:15:10.808
Wheelock.

01:15:12.433 --> 01:15:16.267
Malone's dog was born December
eleventh, ten weeks.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:20.392
I've already worked it out,
February the twentieth.

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:24.476
That's only four days from now!

01:15:26.893 --> 01:15:29.768
Wheelock, New Providence,
Pennsylvania.

01:15:30.851 --> 01:15:33.351
How can I call Wheelock and tell him

01:15:33.351 --> 01:15:36.810
he's going to be killed by the people
who gave him his baby?

01:15:37.352 --> 01:15:40.810
That Josef Mengele has already killed
the fathers of at least

01:15:41.185 --> 01:15:43.644
two other boys who happen
to be twins?

01:15:45.185 --> 01:15:48.519
Who would believe such
a preposterous story?

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:50.149
Herr Doktor, how kind of you to come.

01:16:50.565 --> 01:16:52.024
A pleasure to be here.

01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:56.774
- Can this be little Elsa?
- Yes! You remember!

01:17:00.566 --> 01:17:05.983
Last time I saw you were that
high. You had whooping cough.

01:17:07.191 --> 01:17:08.108
No, no.

01:17:10.233 --> 01:17:12.775
I'm going to dance with
your beautiful daughter.

01:17:46.236 --> 01:17:47.611
Good evening, how are you?

01:17:50.111 --> 01:17:52.653
May I present to you
my wife Gertrud?

01:17:53.153 --> 01:17:56.779
- My love, Herr Mengele.
- It's such an honour meeting you.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.695
We're here on a little
second honey-moon.

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:07.904
You're supposed to be in Krintianstad,
getting ready to kill Oscarsson.

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.030
Traitor!

01:18:25.572 --> 01:18:26.364
No!

01:18:31.489 --> 01:18:33.197
He betrayed me!

01:18:34.031 --> 01:18:35.781
He betrayed you!

01:18:35.781 --> 01:18:38.573
He betrayed the Aryan race!

01:18:40.573 --> 01:18:41.823
Get a doctor!

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.615
I am a doctor, idiot.

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.990
Don't you come near him!

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:49.865
Shut up, you ugly bitch!

01:18:59.491 --> 01:19:03.241
- I thought you knew...
- Hold still, hold still.

01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:05.409
<i>Doktor Mengele.</i>

01:19:08.575 --> 01:19:11.575
Could I call you away from surgery
for one moment?

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.700
If you'll excuse me.

01:19:20.493 --> 01:19:24.410
And why was I not told that,
that man was called back?

01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:26.868
- All the men have been recalled.
- Recalled?

01:19:27.701 --> 01:19:30.368
They should all be back here
by the end of the week.

01:19:31.868 --> 01:19:33.243
But why?

01:19:33.911 --> 01:19:34.994
What has happened?

01:19:35.536 --> 01:19:39.202
Lieberman visited Frieda Maloney
in prison.

01:19:40.536 --> 01:19:42.119
Lieberman again?

01:19:42.119 --> 01:19:46.244
Will I be plagued to my dying day
by that infernal Jew?

01:19:46.244 --> 01:19:48.578
Maloney told him about the adoptions.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:53.703
Well, that's not catastrophic,
Seibert.

01:19:54.745 --> 01:19:58.037
She only knows about America,
work can still continue in Europe.

01:19:58.537 --> 01:20:01.663
The organization doesn't share
your optimism, Herr Doktor.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:04.996
But all Lieberman has are a few
paltry shreds of information

01:20:05.163 --> 01:20:07.204
that he could not possibly
piece together.

01:20:07.913 --> 01:20:10.913
Eighteen of your subjects
have died.

01:20:11.163 --> 01:20:14.454
That means according to your
figures that we can be sure of one,

01:20:14.454 --> 01:20:16.164
perhaps even two successes.

01:20:16.955 --> 01:20:18.914
And if my calculations are wrong?

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:21.705
There's only one chance in twenty,
or thirty.

01:20:22.164 --> 01:20:25.122
No, Seibert, the men must
go back.

01:20:25.664 --> 01:20:28.414
They can't, the operation
has been terminated.

01:20:31.873 --> 01:20:33.415
Terminated?

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:36.373
By whose authority?

01:20:40.123 --> 01:20:42.873
General Rausch and the Colonels.

01:20:51.624 --> 01:20:52.874
I told you.

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:55.124
I told you from the beginning.

01:20:55.124 --> 01:20:57.124
Kill him.
Kill him!

01:20:57.416 --> 01:20:59.125
It would have been so easy!

01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:02.375
It's gone beyond Lieberman,
we don't know who else is involved.

01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:04.000
You have betrayed me!

01:21:05.042 --> 01:21:09.708
You're all... all a bunch of selfish old
men who've lost your courage.

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:13.584
You only want to bask in the sun
in your old age!

01:21:14.043 --> 01:21:18.834
And if your Aryan grandchildren have
to live in a world which is run

01:21:18.834 --> 01:21:23.293
by Jews, and Blacks, and Orientals,
and slobs! You could not care less!

01:21:24.334 --> 01:21:26.460
Your operation has been cancelled.

01:21:27.419 --> 01:21:28.377
No!

01:21:28.835 --> 01:21:31.752
Your operation has been cancelled!

01:21:33.335 --> 01:21:34.919
Mine continues.

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:42.045
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

01:24:17.972 --> 01:24:23.181
This Mengele was sort of a primitive
geneticist in his ons way, wasn't he?

01:24:24.347 --> 01:24:27.722
I understand that he experimented
on human beings.

01:24:28.432 --> 01:24:29.432
Twins.

01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:33.390
Then he was nothing more
than a sadist really.

01:24:34.598 --> 01:24:38.265
A sadis with a M.D. And a Ph.D.

01:24:39.807 --> 01:24:44.099
Well, some people would say that's
a perfect definition of a scientist.

01:24:47.266 --> 01:24:50.724
What exactly do you mean when
you say the boys you saw

01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:52.349
were more than twins?

01:24:53.308 --> 01:24:55.516
Not only do they look alike,

01:24:55.516 --> 01:24:58.517
buy they were also very alike
in personality.

01:24:59.642 --> 01:25:01.017
That is unusual.

01:25:01.475 --> 01:25:04.475
Studies show that twins who are
separated at birth

01:25:04.475 --> 01:25:06.600
develop totally different personalities.

01:25:06.725 --> 01:25:10.976
But these twins, or perhaps
I should say triplets

01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:13.893
because I believe that
my associate saw another

01:25:14.393 --> 01:25:16.810
were like the same people,

01:25:17.476 --> 01:25:21.185
but brought up with different
languages.

01:25:22.476 --> 01:25:24.436
It's impossible, of course.

01:25:25.977 --> 01:25:28.977
Excuse me doctor, but
what is impossible?

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:35.561
What is impossible, doctor?

01:25:37.061 --> 01:25:39.395
Mononuclear reproduction.

01:25:40.645 --> 01:25:41.728
Doctor.

01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:44.395
Cloning.

01:25:45.395 --> 01:25:49.228
What if I were to tell you that
I could take a scraping of skin

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:52.813
from you finger and create
another Ezra Lieberman?

01:25:54.021 --> 01:25:57.979
I would tell you not to waste
your time, or my finger.

01:25:58.771 --> 01:26:00.521
Anyway, that is cloning.

01:26:00.771 --> 01:26:02.438
It was first done with plants.

01:26:03.104 --> 01:26:05.729
A cutting taken from a plant
and transplanted

01:26:05.729 --> 01:26:08.980
grew to be the exact duplicate
of the donor plant.

01:26:09.522 --> 01:26:12.980
Now we are doing the same thing
with laboratory animals.

01:26:13.939 --> 01:26:17.772
You mean, you can produce
an animal from itself?

01:26:18.647 --> 01:26:22.898
We take the unfertilized egg
off an ovulating female

01:26:22.898 --> 01:26:25.440
and destroy all of its genes
and chromosomes.

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:29.523
We then implant the nucleus
of the donor cell

01:26:29.523 --> 01:26:34.232
which could be taken from a blood
sample, or even a skin scraping.

01:26:34.524 --> 01:26:38.149
That cell with its genetic material
intact,

01:26:38.482 --> 01:26:42.816
eventually becomes an embryo
and is born as a living creature.

01:26:44.357 --> 01:26:45.357
Without parents?

01:26:46.649 --> 01:26:50.150
Well, it has no father because
the egg was never fertilized.

01:26:50.442 --> 01:26:54.608
No mother, because its genetic code
comes from another being.

01:26:55.233 --> 01:26:56.608
Can you follow that?

01:26:57.317 --> 01:27:02.151
And this creature, is an exact
duplicate of itself?

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:05.901
Doctor, how can that be?

01:27:07.318 --> 01:27:08.318
Come along.

01:27:15.234 --> 01:27:18.527
Ous experiments began with
the simplest of animals,

01:27:18.527 --> 01:27:19.860
shrimps and frogs.

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:25.694
Animals in which the female's eggs
are fertilized externally.

01:27:31.695 --> 01:27:33.611
Then we moved on to mammals.

01:27:34.445 --> 01:27:36.695
We tried several laboratoty animals

01:27:36.695 --> 01:27:38.986
and found the rabbit
most convenient.

01:27:40.195 --> 01:27:43.528
I had to develop instruments
which could accomplig the operation

01:27:45.321 --> 01:27:47.654
and a whole micro-injection system

01:27:48.112 --> 01:27:49.487
I'll show you how it's done.

01:27:52.321 --> 01:27:56.446
Here we are removing the eggs of
white rabbit from the Fallopian tubes.

01:27:59.738 --> 01:28:03.322
Now, you see the egg
under a microscope.

01:28:03.988 --> 01:28:07.322
I've brought the point of an ordinary
sewing needle into view

01:28:07.322 --> 01:28:09.488
to give an idea of the size.

01:28:10.155 --> 01:28:11.572
They are that small?

01:28:12.072 --> 01:28:14.573
Most mammal eggs are about
that size.

01:28:15.448 --> 01:28:17.698
- Including human eggs?
- Yes.

01:28:18.364 --> 01:28:22.989
The next step is to destroy
the egg nucleus

01:28:22.989 --> 01:28:24.448
with ultraviolet light.

01:28:24.739 --> 01:28:27.657
So that none of its genetic
make-up remains.

01:28:30.574 --> 01:28:33.532
Now you see an egg from
a white rabbit

01:28:33.532 --> 01:28:38.282
ready to be injected with the blood
cell from a black rabbit donor.

01:28:39.949 --> 01:28:44.283
With the injection pipette
one of the blood cells is sucked up

01:28:44.283 --> 01:28:46.408
and then injected into the egg.

01:28:51.325 --> 01:28:55.326
After a few hours the eggs
in culture divide

01:28:55.742 --> 01:28:58.409
and are ready to be put back
into the female.

01:29:02.784 --> 01:29:04.701
There, they grow into embryos,

01:29:04.992 --> 01:29:08.743
which in a month's time
the normal gestation period,

01:29:08.952 --> 01:29:10.910
they will become baby rabbits.

01:29:12.702 --> 01:29:17.535
In this instance, a black litter,
from a a white mother

01:29:17.827 --> 01:29:22.077
and their black colour proves
that they have been cloned

01:29:22.285 --> 01:29:24.953
from the blood cell of a black
rabbit.

01:29:39.329 --> 01:29:43.495
But, isn't it difficult to get the egg
back into the female?

01:29:43.995 --> 01:29:46.037
Transferring the eggs isn't a problem

01:29:46.037 --> 01:29:48.370
we do that all the time
with laboratory animals.

01:29:49.037 --> 01:29:52.371
The really tricky part is
the micro-surgery.

01:29:53.413 --> 01:29:56.496
Getting the donor cell into the egg.

01:29:56.913 --> 01:29:59.788
You're lucky if one in ten survives.

01:30:00.371 --> 01:30:02.705
This can be done with humans?

01:30:02.996 --> 01:30:05.622
If the surgical technique were
precise enough.

01:30:05.997 --> 01:30:08.206
- It's monstrous, doctor!
- Why?

01:30:08.997 --> 01:30:12.622
Wouldn't you want to live in a world
full of Mozarts and Picassos?

01:30:13.664 --> 01:30:15.206
Of course, it's only a dream.

01:30:15.414 --> 01:30:20.290
Not only would you have to reproduce
the genetic code of the donor,

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:23.582
but the environmental background
as well.

01:30:26.957 --> 01:30:30.498
Is Mengele trying to reproduce
himself?

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:37.333
No, he has brown eyes, and he comes
from a very wealthy family.

01:30:38.083 --> 01:30:42.874
Let's examine the family background
of the donor.

01:30:47.167 --> 01:30:49.292
The father is sixty-five years old.

01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:51.125
Civil servant.

01:30:54.875 --> 01:30:56.500
The mother is forty-two, you say?

01:30:59.834 --> 01:31:01.501
She dotes on the child.

01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:05.710
Spoils.

01:31:07.751 --> 01:31:09.085
The boy is...

01:31:11.168 --> 01:31:12.293
pale...

01:31:15.794 --> 01:31:16.836
dark hair...

01:31:19.502 --> 01:31:20.752
blue eyes.

01:31:22.836 --> 01:31:24.211
Spoilt.

01:31:30.795 --> 01:31:31.920
Right?

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.795
Now, Mengele would certainly know
every social and environmental detail

01:31:38.795 --> 01:31:40.712
would have to be reproduced.

01:31:41.545 --> 01:31:45.296
Thus, if the parents were divorced
when the boy was ten,

01:31:45.546 --> 01:31:47.504
this would have to be arranged.

01:31:48.254 --> 01:31:49.338
Doctor Bruckner,

01:31:51.588 --> 01:31:53.546
the one who is cloned,

01:31:55.213 --> 01:31:56.463
the donor,

01:31:56.672 --> 01:31:59.464
- he has to be alive, doesn't he?
- Not necessarily.

01:31:59.922 --> 01:32:04.380
Individual cells taken from a donor
can be preserved indefinitely.

01:32:05.172 --> 01:32:09.089
With a sample of Mozart's blood
and the women,

01:32:09.339 --> 01:32:11.715
someone with the skill
and the equipment,

01:32:11.715 --> 01:32:14.131
could breed a few hundred
baby Mozarts.

01:32:21.798 --> 01:32:22.965
My God.

01:32:23.756 --> 01:32:25.507
If it's really been done,

01:32:27.007 --> 01:32:29.382
what I'd give to see one
of those boys.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:35.674
Herr Lieberman!

01:32:42.425 --> 01:32:43.633
Herr Lieberman.

01:32:46.633 --> 01:32:48.967
Not Mozart, doctor.

01:32:50.883 --> 01:32:52.175
Not Picasso.

01:32:53.759 --> 01:32:56.426
Not a genius who would enrich
the world,

01:32:58.843 --> 01:33:00.718
but a lonely little boy

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:03.509
with a domineering father,

01:33:04.468 --> 01:33:06.301
a customs officer

01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:09.510
who was fifty-two when
he was born.

01:33:11.094 --> 01:33:12.219
And...

01:33:12.677 --> 01:33:15.385
an affectionate doting mother

01:33:16.802 --> 01:33:19.135
who was twenty-nine.

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:23.845
The father died at sixty-five

01:33:24.928 --> 01:33:27.970
when the boy was nearly fourteen.

01:33:35.887 --> 01:33:37.596
Adolf Hitler.

01:34:44.183 --> 01:34:45.434
Colonel Seibert.

01:37:39.529 --> 01:37:40.571
You Lieberman?

01:37:44.363 --> 01:37:45.071
<i>Ja.</i>

01:37:45.488 --> 01:37:46.529
Come in.

01:37:59.905 --> 01:38:01.072
Okay, boys.

01:38:02.948 --> 01:38:04.406
Beautiful dogs.

01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:07.906
Tear the throat out of anyone
who even looks cross-eyed at me.

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:13.406
I guess you can see why I didn't
exactly wet my pants

01:38:13.406 --> 01:38:15.574
when you said someone
was out to get me.

01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:16.991
Yeah.

01:38:17.449 --> 01:38:18.741
Take off your coat.

01:38:55.368 --> 01:38:56.659
Very impressive.

01:38:57.994 --> 01:38:58.994
Yeah.

01:39:05.744 --> 01:39:07.702
My son took those pictures.

01:39:08.119 --> 01:39:09.410
Very good.

01:39:10.785 --> 01:39:12.036
Very good.

01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:15.078
A little artsy-fartsy, if you ask me.

01:39:15.745 --> 01:39:19.078
- Is your son at home now?
- No, he's in school.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.371
And Mrs. Wheelock,
is she at home?

01:39:25.579 --> 01:39:26.787
She's still at work.

01:39:27.162 --> 01:39:30.829
So you're the guy who got that
Nazi Eichmann?

01:39:34.204 --> 01:39:35.704
I located him.

01:39:36.496 --> 01:39:39.413
It was the Israelis who did
the actual kidnapping.

01:39:39.622 --> 01:39:40.955
How much did you get for that?

01:39:41.955 --> 01:39:42.997
Nothing.

01:39:44.038 --> 01:39:47.538
I did it for the satisfaction,
I hate all Nazis.

01:39:48.538 --> 01:39:50.372
I don't know about the Nazis.

01:39:51.497 --> 01:39:53.080
The Niggers we got to worry about.

01:39:54.789 --> 01:39:57.039
Hey, why are these Nazis after me?

01:39:57.581 --> 01:39:58.623
Well...

01:40:01.539 --> 01:40:03.206
You know, I...

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:04.914
I find it very hard to talk.

01:40:04.914 --> 01:40:06.956
Don't worry about them,
they won't bother you

01:40:07.832 --> 01:40:09.082
unless you bother me.

01:40:09.249 --> 01:40:12.540
I was attacked by... by a dog
when I was a child,

01:40:12.832 --> 01:40:14.082
a German shepherd,

01:40:15.082 --> 01:40:18.582
and I still feel uncomfortable
with a dog in the room.

01:40:18.915 --> 01:40:21.791
Jesus! You're like my neighbour
Wally.

01:40:21.791 --> 01:40:23.833
I mean, he won't even walk up
the driveway

01:40:23.833 --> 01:40:25.666
unless the dogs are lockep up.

01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:26.666
Okay.

01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:33.666
Come on, boys, in you go.

01:40:38.959 --> 01:40:41.417
There's no other way that
they can come in?

01:40:41.876 --> 01:40:42.876
No.

01:40:43.334 --> 01:40:44.334
Thank you.

01:40:46.459 --> 01:40:48.209
I feel much better.

01:40:55.668 --> 01:40:56.835
Hey!

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.752
Put your hands up.

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:00.627
What the hell are you up to, anyway?

01:41:01.293 --> 01:41:03.085
Is there a basement in this house?

01:41:04.461 --> 01:41:05.461
Yeah.

01:41:05.586 --> 01:41:06.586
Take me to it.

01:41:16.794 --> 01:41:18.712
Do you have any pictures
of your son?

01:41:19.587 --> 01:41:21.545
There's an album on the table.

01:41:22.004 --> 01:41:23.379
What do you want them for?

01:41:23.587 --> 01:41:25.004
Please, do not worry.

01:41:25.670 --> 01:41:28.379
I am very anxious to see him
and talk to him.

01:41:28.379 --> 01:41:31.129
I am the doctor who delivered him.

01:41:34.713 --> 01:41:35.963
Open the door.

01:41:44.505 --> 01:41:46.714
Go down the stairs, Mr. Wheelock.

01:42:07.465 --> 01:42:11.257
Now, listen, I don't give a doodily-shit
about Jews or Nazis.

01:42:11.882 --> 01:42:13.048
Good.

01:42:46.343 --> 01:42:48.843
Tell me, please, which way
to Quarryville?

01:42:49.385 --> 01:42:51.385
Turn left at the end of the exit,

01:42:51.385 --> 01:42:54.801
it's beyond Thirty, take a left, it'll take
you straight into Quarryville.

01:42:55.218 --> 01:42:56.219
Thank you.

01:43:05.177 --> 01:43:06.677
Quiet, damn you!

01:43:14.887 --> 01:43:17.428
Bobby, dear, dear, boy.

01:45:01.644 --> 01:45:02.895
Mr. Wheelock.

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.020
Mr. Wheelock.

01:45:31.188 --> 01:45:32.480
Mr. Wheelock!

01:45:52.231 --> 01:45:53.356
Mister...

01:45:57.606 --> 01:45:58.857
You.

01:45:59.690 --> 01:46:01.440
Herr Lieberman.

01:47:03.528 --> 01:47:05.403
Get up, Jew!

01:47:06.236 --> 01:47:07.403
Up!

01:47:08.195 --> 01:47:09.362
Up!

01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:16.320
Yes, I am going to kill you,

01:47:17.154 --> 01:47:19.529
but I want you to go to your death
with the knowledge

01:47:19.529 --> 01:47:21.445
that all your efforts have gone
for nothing!

01:47:21.737 --> 01:47:23.821
I have the money, and
I have the will!

01:47:23.821 --> 01:47:26.238
And no one can stop me!

01:47:28.071 --> 01:47:30.363
Did you kill Wheelock?

01:47:30.905 --> 01:47:35.613
No, he's in the kitchen,
mixing us some cocktails.

01:47:43.822 --> 01:47:48.489
Do you know what I saw on the
television in my motel room

01:47:48.489 --> 01:47:49.947
at one o'clock this morning?

01:47:52.532 --> 01:47:54.740
Films of Hitler.

01:47:56.407 --> 01:47:58.615
They are showing films
about the war,

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.032
the movement, people are
fascinated,

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.574
the time is ripe.

01:48:06.824 --> 01:48:10.241
Adolf Hitler is alive.

01:48:14.449 --> 01:48:16.866
Tis album is full of pictures of him.

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:22.117
Bobby Wheelock and ninety-three
other boys

01:48:22.117 --> 01:48:24.992
are exact genetic duplicates of him.

01:48:25.159 --> 01:48:27.450
Bred entirely from his cells.

01:48:28.742 --> 01:48:32.159
He allowed me to take half
a litre of his blood

01:48:32.159 --> 01:48:34.618
and a cutting of skin from his ribs.

01:48:38.451 --> 01:48:41.451
We were in a biblical frame of mind.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.827
On the 23rd of May, 1943,
at the Berghof.

01:48:47.952 --> 01:48:52.536
He had denied himself children
because he knew that no son

01:48:52.536 --> 01:48:55.786
could flourish in the shadow
of so God-like a father.

01:48:56.202 --> 01:49:01.245
But then he heard what was
theoretically possible

01:49:01.787 --> 01:49:07.662
that I could create one day not his son
not even a carbon copy,

01:49:07.662 --> 01:49:09.495
but another original!

01:49:10.287 --> 01:49:13.037
He was thrilled by the idea!

01:49:13.662 --> 01:49:17.079
The right Hitler for the right future.

01:49:17.579 --> 01:49:24.913
A Hitler tailor-made for the 1980's,
'90's, 2000.

01:49:39.789 --> 01:49:40.914
Kill!

01:50:11.875 --> 01:50:13.000
Away!

01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:15.417
Off!

01:50:18.708 --> 01:50:19.792
No more gun.

01:50:32.084 --> 01:50:33.793
Holy shit!

01:50:37.293 --> 01:50:38.293
Bobby.

01:50:41.294 --> 01:50:42.335
Bobby.

01:50:43.252 --> 01:50:45.502
My dear, dear boy.

01:50:46.210 --> 01:50:49.669
You cannot possibly imagine
how happy I am,

01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:56.586
how joyous I am, to see you standing
there so fine, strong and handsome.

01:50:57.711 --> 01:51:00.795
Call these dogs off, Bobby,
call the dogs off, please.

01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:08.212
I'm an old friend of the family.

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:12.879
In fact I'm the doctor
who delivered you.

01:51:13.671 --> 01:51:17.754
And I stopped by, having just
returned from abroad,

01:51:19.171 --> 01:51:21.255
and he let me in.

01:51:21.963 --> 01:51:24.463
And then he pulled out a gun,

01:51:26.463 --> 01:51:29.380
fortunately I was able
to overpower him.

01:51:30.338 --> 01:51:33.922
Now call them off, Bobby,
call them off, please.

01:51:35.964 --> 01:51:37.048
Cut!

01:51:38.548 --> 01:51:40.964
Cut, how clever.

01:51:40.964 --> 01:51:47.256
I said, 'off', and I said, 'away' and
I said 'no gun, no more gun'.

01:51:47.714 --> 01:51:50.840
- Then you had the gun.
- No, he had, he...

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:53.507
They're trained to attack
anyone carrying a gun.

01:51:53.757 --> 01:51:57.007
- They were locked up and let them out.
- The dogs are never locked up.

01:51:58.049 --> 01:51:59.340
Bobby.

01:52:00.049 --> 01:52:01.799
- My dear, dear...
- Action!

01:52:03.925 --> 01:52:05.633
Cut.
Cut!

01:52:06.091 --> 01:52:07.591
They won't listen to you.

01:52:10.133 --> 01:52:11.175
Bobby.

01:52:11.383 --> 01:52:15.091
That man is your enemy,
don't listen to him, I beg of you.

01:52:15.633 --> 01:52:17.509
Call the police.

01:52:18.676 --> 01:52:19.676
Yeah.

01:52:21.259 --> 01:52:23.217
By all means, do so, Bobby,

01:52:23.467 --> 01:52:26.759
but first there are some things
about yourself you must know.

01:52:35.802 --> 01:52:36.677
What do you mean?

01:52:36.677 --> 01:52:40.510
If I prove to you that I know you
better than anyone in the world,

01:52:41.177 --> 01:52:44.343
better even than your own mother,
will you listen to me?

01:52:48.553 --> 01:52:50.511
You are a clever boy.

01:52:51.428 --> 01:52:52.553
Are you not?

01:52:54.011 --> 01:52:58.594
You do not do well in school,
that is because you are too clever.

01:52:59.345 --> 01:53:02.262
Too busy thinking your own thoughts,

01:53:02.262 --> 01:53:06.095
but you are much smarter than
your teachers, eh?

01:53:06.304 --> 01:53:08.137
My teachers are nowhere.

01:53:08.512 --> 01:53:12.805
You are going to be the world's
greatest photographer, are you not?

01:53:15.221 --> 01:53:18.388
Have you ever felt superior
to those around you?

01:53:18.555 --> 01:53:21.013
Like a prince among peasants?

01:53:21.638 --> 01:53:24.138
I feel different from everyone
sometimes.

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:27.056
You are infinitely different.

01:53:27.764 --> 01:53:29.472
Infinitely superior.

01:53:30.347 --> 01:53:32.806
You were born of the noblest blood
in the world.

01:53:33.847 --> 01:53:36.806
You have it within you
to fulfil ambitions

01:53:36.931 --> 01:53:41.140
a thousand times greater than
those of which you presently dream.

01:53:41.515 --> 01:53:43.765
And you shall fulfil them, Bobby.

01:53:44.098 --> 01:53:45.348
You shall.

01:53:45.973 --> 01:53:48.723
You are the living duplicate
of the greatest man

01:53:48.973 --> 01:53:49.973
in history.

01:53:53.432 --> 01:53:55.308
Adolf Hitler.

01:54:02.183 --> 01:54:03.849
Oh, man, you're weird.

01:54:07.766 --> 01:54:09.809
Bobby, I'm telling you the truth.

01:54:10.017 --> 01:54:14.350
- Find your father.
- What?

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:19.850
He killed your father.

01:54:22.517 --> 01:54:24.101
Bobby, listen to me.

01:54:25.351 --> 01:54:29.476
It was this vicious Jew,
your sworn enemy.

01:54:30.018 --> 01:54:32.810
He killed your father, and he came
here to kill you.

01:54:34.851 --> 01:54:35.893
<i>Bobby.</i>

01:54:36.936 --> 01:54:38.561
<i>Let me protect you.</i>

01:54:40.394 --> 01:54:44.394
All your power will burst forth
when the time comes.

01:54:45.394 --> 01:54:46.561
When you grow older

01:54:47.269 --> 01:54:50.895
<i>and you see the world engulfed</i>
<i>by human garbage.</i>

01:54:51.645 --> 01:54:57.353
When you feel this urge rising within
you to save your own Aryan folk

01:54:57.353 --> 01:54:58.853
from extintion.

01:55:00.187 --> 01:55:02.895
Then you will rejoice
in your heritage

01:55:03.103 --> 01:55:05.938
<i>and bless me for creating you.</i>

01:55:09.563 --> 01:55:10.688
Bobby!

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:15.688
You must understand!
Your parents are of no importance!

01:55:15.688 --> 01:55:17.271
They were chosen for you!

01:55:18.646 --> 01:55:20.730
Now that they have served
their purpose

01:55:21.147 --> 01:55:23.814
they must disappear from your life!

01:55:25.730 --> 01:55:26.814
Bobby!

01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:30.564
Bobby!

01:55:31.022 --> 01:55:32.772
You freaked-out maniac!

01:55:33.648 --> 01:55:34.648
Bite!

01:56:03.233 --> 01:56:04.067
Bobby!

01:56:08.275 --> 01:56:10.233
Holy shit!

01:56:12.650 --> 01:56:13.650
Cut.

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:16.109
Cut!

01:56:17.568 --> 01:56:18.818
Cut!

01:56:24.609 --> 01:56:25.901
Hey, man!

01:56:26.984 --> 01:56:28.026
Get out of here!

01:56:33.610 --> 01:56:34.777
Out.

01:56:49.986 --> 01:56:52.695
I think you'll die if I don't call
an ambulance for you.

01:56:55.861 --> 01:56:57.446
I could just go out right now,

01:56:57.779 --> 01:56:59.737
my mum won't be home until late.

01:57:00.696 --> 01:57:02.321
You'll be dead by then.

01:57:03.737 --> 01:57:06.821
If I call the police, will you tell
them what I did?

01:57:11.738 --> 01:57:12.738
Okay.

01:57:13.363 --> 01:57:14.363
Shake.

01:57:19.447 --> 01:57:20.655
Come on, shake.

01:57:22.613 --> 01:57:24.822
Okay, you got a deal.

01:57:42.490 --> 01:57:45.782
<i>I'd like an ambulance and a police</i>
<i>car to the Wheelock residence</i>

01:57:45.782 --> 01:57:47.449
<i>on Old Buck Road, please.</i>

01:57:51.657 --> 01:57:53.408
Hey, man, this is an emergency.

01:57:55.408 --> 01:57:57.158
A heavy duty emergency.

01:58:41.036 --> 01:58:42.036
David.

01:58:43.244 --> 01:58:44.911
What a surprise.

01:58:45.536 --> 01:58:47.703
Which one of the assassins
was it, Mr. Lieberman?

01:58:49.579 --> 01:58:52.204
I thought you went to a wedding.

01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:55.329
No more deception now.

01:58:55.954 --> 01:58:57.537
No more blind alleys.

01:58:57.829 --> 01:58:58.829
All right.

01:58:59.995 --> 01:59:01.162
It was Mengele.

01:59:02.245 --> 01:59:03.371
He's dead.

01:59:05.288 --> 01:59:06.330
It's over.

01:59:06.705 --> 01:59:08.455
The Doring boy ins't dead yet.

01:59:08.913 --> 01:59:12.871
Neither is Simon Harrington, nor
Jack Curry or Bobby Wheelock.

01:59:14.663 --> 01:59:17.372
It took a little time, a little
back tracking,

01:59:17.372 --> 01:59:19.456
a visit to Dr. Bruckner.

01:59:20.206 --> 01:59:21.497
But now we know...

01:59:21.956 --> 01:59:22.997
everything.

01:59:23.997 --> 01:59:26.956
And what are you going
to do about it?

01:59:29.414 --> 01:59:30.539
Kill the boys.

01:59:35.915 --> 01:59:37.540
Brilliant man that Mengele.

01:59:39.665 --> 01:59:43.290
I suppose he had all 94 of those
names and addresses memorized.

01:59:45.416 --> 01:59:47.874
Now, you are trying to fool me.

01:59:49.791 --> 01:59:52.541
You have been searching the room.

01:59:52.791 --> 01:59:55.416
- He must've had a list.
- He did, now I have it.

01:59:55.708 --> 01:59:56.708
Give it to me.

01:59:56.999 --> 01:59:58.166
Why?

01:59:59.584 --> 02:00:01.334
We have the right and
we have the duty.

02:00:01.875 --> 02:00:04.250
To do what?
Kill children?

02:00:04.584 --> 02:00:05.834
Give me that list.

02:00:13.042 --> 02:00:15.293
You'll have to take it from me.

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.043
And when you do you can add
my name to the list.

02:00:19.418 --> 02:00:21.043
I don't mean you any harm.

02:00:21.543 --> 02:00:23.585
You'll have to kill me, David.

02:00:24.751 --> 02:00:27.293
The first of those boys
that you touch,

02:00:28.002 --> 02:00:33.002
I will turn you and your entire
organization over to the police.

02:00:33.919 --> 02:00:35.544
I swear I'll do that.

02:00:36.502 --> 02:00:38.794
You would protect Hitler?

02:00:39.377 --> 02:00:40.544
No.

02:00:41.962 --> 02:00:47.087
Not... not slaughter the innocnet,
and neither will you.

02:00:47.628 --> 02:00:52.295
A fanatic you may be, but a murderer
of young children you are not.

02:00:53.628 --> 02:00:55.754
You know, there is a nurse here,

02:00:56.588 --> 02:01:00.463
an angel of mercy called
Miss Hanrahan,

02:01:00.921 --> 02:01:03.838
who actually gives me cigarettes.

02:01:03.838 --> 02:01:05.754
You know, what she said to me
the other day?

02:01:05.754 --> 02:01:10.089
She said, 'Mr. Lieberman, if you can
escape Buchenwald

02:01:11.422 --> 02:01:16.922
and you can escape those bullets,
then a few cigarettes will not hurt you.'

02:01:25.131 --> 02:01:26.840
Wasn't that a nice thing to say?

02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:59.883
Mad.
