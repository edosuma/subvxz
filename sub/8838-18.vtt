20:09.668 --> 20:11.503
I MEAN, YOU'VE HAD
YOUR PICTURE TAKEN
BEFORE.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.213
NOT FOR A NEWSPAPER!

20:13.380 --> 20:15.173
WELL, WE'LL PUT ON
OUR SUNDAY FINEST.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.717
OH, NO, NO, NO!

20:16.884 --> 20:18.468
THAT WILL
NEVER DO! NO!

20:18.635 --> 20:19.845
YOU MUST LOOK YOUR
VERY, VERY BEST

20:20.012 --> 20:22.264
TO HAVE YOUR PICTURES
TAKEN FOR THE NEWSPAPER.

20:22.431 --> 20:24.182
NOW, NELS BROUGHT IN
A NEW SHIPMENT

20:24.349 --> 20:25.642
OF FINE NEW CLOTHES
JUST THE OTHER DAY.

20:25.809 --> 20:28.186
WE CAN'T PAY
FOR THEM,
MRS. OLESON.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.189
OH, HA HA HA!
HARRIET!

20:31.356 --> 20:32.858
YOU AND YOUR JOKES!

20:33.025 --> 20:34.151
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT
YOUR CREDIT'S

20:34.318 --> 20:36.778
ALWAYS BEEN GOOD

20:36.945 --> 20:39.031
AND NOW IT'S
EVEN BETTER! HA HA!

20:39.197 --> 20:42.451
OH, CAROLINE!
I HAVE THE PERFECT
DRESS FOR YOU!

20:42.618 --> 20:45.120
OH, YES,
IT'S VERY, VERY SMART.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.538
IT'S ELEGANT BUT SIMPLE.

20:46.705 --> 20:50.500
AND NELS HAS
SOME NICE BROADCLOTH
SUITS, CHARLES.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.377
I'M SURE THAT THERE WILL
BE ONE THAT WILL FIT YOU.

20:52.544 --> 20:56.048
AND THERE'S SOME
LOVELY LITTLE DRESSES
FOR THE GIRLS!

20:56.214 --> 20:58.091
OH, CHARLES,

21:01.219 --> 21:03.221
ALL RIGHT. LOOK,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
STAY IN TOWN,

21:03.388 --> 21:04.514
TRY THE DRESSES ON,

21:04.681 --> 21:06.391
I'LL BRING THE GIRLS
OVER AFTER SCHOOL.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.727
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.
COME ON, CAROLINE!

21:08.894 --> 21:09.937
OH, THIS IS
SO EXCITING!

21:10.103 --> 21:12.230
OH, LAURA,
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

21:12.397 --> 21:14.483
PLEASE GIVE HIM OUR
THANKS FOR THE ENTIRE
SCHOOL, WILL YOU?

21:14.650 --> 21:16.526
- YES, I WILL.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:20.072 --> 21:22.616
UH, YES, ANDREW,
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.244
CLASS, I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.537
AS YOU KNOW,

21:27.704 --> 21:29.289
LAURA INGALLS IS THE CHAIRMAN
OF OUR BOOK DRIVE,

21:29.456 --> 21:31.792
WELL, SHE'S JUST TOLD ME
THAT HER FATHER HAS AGREED

21:31.959 --> 21:34.503
TO SUPPLY THE BOOKS
FOR THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.546
LET'S SHOW HER
OUR THANKS.

21:36.713 --> 21:39.758
[APPLAUSE]

21:44.137 --> 21:45.138
OH...

21:45.305 --> 21:47.891
UH, YES, ANDREW,
WHAT IS IT?

21:48.058 --> 21:49.101
UH...

21:49.267 --> 21:50.477
NOTHING.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.354
NOTHING IMPORTANT.

21:59.653 --> 22:01.113
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS SUIT, NELS.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.448
I THINK I KIND OF
LOOK LIKE AN UNDERTAKER
OR SOMETHING.

22:03.615 --> 22:06.201
WELL, IT MAKES
A FINE FUNERAL SUIT.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.412
LARS HANSON HAD ONE
JUST LIKE IT,

22:08.578 --> 22:09.871
AND SO DOES
THE BANKER, TOO.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.957
WELL, THAT'S THEM.
I THINK I LOOK
KIND OF FUNNY.

22:12.124 --> 22:13.959
WELL, IT'S THAT SHIRT
YOU'RE WEARING.

22:14.126 --> 22:16.628
LET ME GET YOU
A NICE WHITE LINEN ONE.

22:16.795 --> 22:19.548
I CAN SEE MYSELF
IN A COFFIN RIGHT NOW.

22:19.715 --> 22:20.841
CHARLES.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.721
DO YOU LIKE IT,
CHARLES?

22:25.887 --> 22:26.972
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH,

22:27.139 --> 22:30.934
BUT I LIKED
THE LAST THREE YOU
HAD ON, TOO.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.227
HARRIET...

22:32.394 --> 22:34.312
I THINK I'LL TRY
THIS ON AGAIN.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.313
ALL RIGHT.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.273
THAT LOOKS NICE.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.315
THANK YOU.
TRY TO HURRY.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.359
Caroline:
YES, YES, YES. HA HA.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.612
REVEREND STOPPED BY
LATE LAST NIGHT.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.114
TOLD ME ABOUT
THE ORGAN.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.907
WELL, I HOPE
HE DOESN'T MAKE
A BIG THING OUT OF IT.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.993
WELL, HE WAS
VERY EXCITED,
THAT'S ALL.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.911
I WENT AHEAD
AND ORDERED IT.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.955
NELS, YOU KNOW,
I HAVEN'T SEEN A PENNY
OF THAT MONEY YET.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.832
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BILL YOU FOR IT.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.542
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, CHARLES.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.878
THAT'S THE WAY
RICH FOLKS BUY
MOST EVERYTHING.

22:59.129 --> 23:00.380
ALL RIGHT.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.174
WELL, AS LONG AS
I'M BUYING THINGS
ON CREDIT,

23:02.340 --> 23:04.342
I WONDER IF I COULD
ORDER A SET OF BOOKS
FOR THE SCHOOL?

23:04.509 --> 23:06.303
THEY COULD JUST COME OVER
AND PICK OUT WHAT THEY WANT.

23:06.470 --> 23:08.221
SURE ENOUGH.
ANYTHING ELSE?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.641
WELL, DADBURNIT,
YES, THERE IS.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.102
I WONDER IF YOU HAVE A--
IT'S A WATCH.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.437
IT'S A LADY'S WATCH,

23:15.604 --> 23:17.314
BUT IT'S LIKE A BROOCH,
YOU PIN IT ON?

23:17.481 --> 23:19.733
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU MEAN.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.325
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?
I LIKE BEING RICH!

23:28.492 --> 23:29.493
Mary: MA LET US
WEAR THEM HOME.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.411
WE SHOULDN'T GET
THEM DIRTY.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.997
Laura: I DON'T KNOW. I
THINK MINE'S TOO FANCY.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.541
Nellie: I HAVE
EXCELLENT TASTE IN CLOTHES,

23:36.708 --> 23:39.169
AND I SAY IT'S
EXACTLY RIGHT FOR YOU.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.713
NOBODY ASKED YOU.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.091
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING
US HOME, ANYHOW?

23:44.257 --> 23:46.718
BECAUSE YOU'RE
MY FRIENDS.

23:46.885 --> 23:50.472
WELL, YOU NEVER USED TO
WALK WITH US BEFORE,
WHEN WE WERE POOR.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.684
HEY, ANDY!

23:56.728 --> 23:58.897
WANT TO WORK
ON THE CLUBHOUSE?

23:59.064 --> 24:01.066
THAT YOUR NEW
SCHOOL DRESS?

24:01.233 --> 24:03.985
OF COURSE NOT.
JUST FOR BEST.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.570
SUNDAYS, MAYBE.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.323
SURE ISN'T FOR
BUILDING A CLUBHOUSE.

24:09.908 --> 24:12.410
YOU LOOK LIKE
NELLIE OLESON.

24:12.577 --> 24:14.913
ANDREW GARVEY,
YOU TAKE THAT BACK!

24:15.080 --> 24:16.790
WELL, YOU DO!

24:39.187 --> 24:40.647
[CLEARS THROAT]

24:40.814 --> 24:43.191
COME ON, CAROLINE.
JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S IN THE BOX.

24:43.358 --> 24:44.943
I TOLD YOU--
GROCERIES.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.320
WELL, GROCERIES SPOIL
IF YOU KEEP THEM TOO LONG.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.655
THESE WON'T.

24:48.822 --> 24:50.866
AW, CAROLINE...

24:51.032 --> 24:52.409
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

24:52.576 --> 24:54.161
IT'S FOR
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.788
MY...MY BIRTHDAY'S
NOT FOR 3 WEEKS.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.166
I CAN'T WAIT 3 WEEKS
TO OPEN THAT!

24:59.332 --> 25:01.209
YOU'RE WORSE
THAN THE GIRLS.

25:02.419 --> 25:03.503
ALL RIGHT. FORGET IT.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.421
ALL RIGHT.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.923
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.383
OF COURSE, I, UH...

25:08.550 --> 25:10.260
I BOUGHT A FEW
GROCERIES MYSELF.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.972
HA HA HA!
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

25:14.139 --> 25:15.974
BUT YOUR BIRTHDAY
IS 3 MONTHS AWAY!

25:16.141 --> 25:18.518
I ONLY HAVE TO WAIT
3 WEEKS. YOU HAVE TO
WAIT 3 MONTHS!

25:18.685 --> 25:20.145
CHARLES,
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

25:20.312 --> 25:23.148
WHAT'S FAIR FOR ME
IS FAIR FOR YOU. HA HA HA!

25:23.315 --> 25:24.482
YOU GOT TO
WAIT 3 MONTHS.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.610
HA HA HA!

25:26.776 --> 25:28.361
OF COURSE, I'M NOT
STOPPING YOU.

25:31.698 --> 25:32.741
ME, TOO!

25:32.908 --> 25:34.326
[LAUGHING]

25:45.170 --> 25:47.380
OH, CHARLES!

25:48.673 --> 25:52.052
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

25:52.219 --> 25:53.345
TOOLS...

25:53.511 --> 25:54.304
[LAUGHING]

25:54.471 --> 25:56.348
OH, LOOK AT THE TOOLS!

25:56.514 --> 25:57.515
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD YOU.

25:57.682 --> 25:58.934
OH, NO,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.060
DO YOU LIKE IT?

26:00.227 --> 26:01.728
DO I LIKE IT?
I LOVE IT!

26:01.895 --> 26:03.438
OH, I LOVE YOU!

26:05.857 --> 26:07.817
IT'S LIKE A DREAM.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.744
Ripley: JUST SET
THAT EQUIPMENT DOWN
THERE, MR. INGALLS.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.037
Charles: YES, SIR.

26:19.204 --> 26:20.205
Laura: IS THAT
THE CAMERA, PA?

26:20.372 --> 26:21.498
I THINK SO.
COME ON INSIDE.

26:21.665 --> 26:22.791
WE'VE GOT TO GET
THOSE PICTURES TAKEN.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.960
COME RIGHT IN,
MR. RIPLEY.

26:25.126 --> 26:25.877
THANK YOU.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.088
WOULD YOU LIKE
A CUP OF COFFEE?

26:28.255 --> 26:30.131
GIRLS,
LEND A HAND.

26:30.298 --> 26:33.051
LAURA, WILL YOU
GET MR. RIPLEY
A CHAIR, PLEASE?

26:34.552 --> 26:37.055
THERE'S
SOME BISCUITS
AND SOME HONEY.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.810
THIS WON'T DO AT ALL.

26:41.977 --> 26:44.396
WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

26:44.562 --> 26:46.898
THIS...

26:47.065 --> 26:49.609
AND THIS.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.653
HAVE YOU ALWAYS
LIVED LIKE THIS?

26:51.820 --> 26:53.863
WELL, NO. WE LIVED
IN THE SODDY FOR A WHILE,

26:54.030 --> 26:55.490
BUT I BUILT THE HOUSE
AS SOON AS I COULD.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.285
I PUT A NEW KITCHEN ON IT.
WHAT WON'T DO?

26:59.744 --> 27:01.371
WELL, LOOK AT YOU, MAN.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.873
LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.500
WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THESE CLOTHES?

27:05.667 --> 27:07.544
THEY WON'T DO!

27:07.711 --> 27:09.296
YOU LOOK LIKE
CITY PEOPLE!

27:09.462 --> 27:12.090
WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH CITY PEOP--
YOU'RE FROM THE CITY!

27:12.257 --> 27:14.134
THAT'S NOT WHAT
MY READERS WANT.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.219
COULD YOU MAKE
YOURSELF A LITTLE
CLEARER, THEN?

27:16.386 --> 27:17.762
HERE, HERE!

27:17.929 --> 27:19.264
LOOK AT THIS
AND THIS AND THIS!

27:19.431 --> 27:20.932
THIS IS WHAT
MY READERS WANT.

27:21.099 --> 27:24.394
THEY WANT TO CRY
OVER THE HARDSHIPS
YOU'VE SUFFERED.

27:24.561 --> 27:26.438
THEY WANT TO SEE
THE STARVATION--

27:26.604 --> 27:28.690
WELL, WE'VE HAD OUR SHARE
OF TROUBLES, YOU KNOW.

27:30.275 --> 27:33.570
THEY WANT TO REJOICE
WITH YOU AND FOR YOU

27:33.737 --> 27:36.990
FOR THE GOOD FORTUNE
THAT'S BEFALLEN YOU.

27:37.157 --> 27:38.950
DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?

27:40.744 --> 27:42.662
I'M BEGINNING TO.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.623
YOU WANT THEM TO
PITY US AND THEN
FEEL HAPPY FOR US.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.292
EXACTLY.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.378
AND LOOK AT YOU.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.841
LOOK AT THIS FARM.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.509
YOU'RE PROSPEROUS!

27:56.676 --> 27:59.596
WELL, I'M SORRY
THAT WE'RE NOT AS
POOR AS YOU'D HOPED.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.689
IS THAT YOUR SODDY

28:10.982 --> 28:11.816
MM-HMM.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.193
MM-HMM.

28:15.195 --> 28:16.863
SOMETHING
COULD BE DONE.

28:19.908 --> 28:22.077
YOU HAVE SOME
OLD CLOTHES,
DON'T YOU?

28:22.243 --> 28:25.205
UP UNTIL YESTERDAY,
THAT'S ALL WE HAD.

28:25.372 --> 28:27.165
WE COULD DIRTY
THESE UP.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.377
MAYBE TEAR THEM
A LITTLE...

28:30.543 --> 28:32.170
SO THEY'D
LOOK WORN.

28:32.337 --> 28:35.048
SMUDGE UP YOUR
HANDS AND FACES.

28:35.215 --> 28:39.511
MMM. MAKE YOUR HAIR
LOOK STRINGY.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.390
MMM...

28:43.556 --> 28:45.850
STAND YOU IN FRONT
OF THAT OLD SOD.

28:46.017 --> 28:48.395

GREATEST FORTUNES

29:08.832 --> 29:10.708
AT THE BRINK
OF STARVATION,

29:10.875 --> 29:13.795
AND I CRIED AT
THE SIGHT OF THEM.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.214
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CRY FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

29:16.381 --> 29:18.675
HUH?

29:18.842 --> 29:20.385
I SAID, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CRY FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

29:20.552 --> 29:21.803
WE'RE NOT GONNA
GIVE YOU A STORY.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.513
- WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND--
- I KNOW...

29:23.680 --> 29:24.931
THAT'S JUST
THE PROBLEM, MR. RIPLEY.
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND!

29:25.098 --> 29:26.391
Ripley: WAIT! PLEASE!
YOU CAN'T TO THIS!

29:26.558 --> 29:28.560
BUT I AM DOING IT,

29:33.273 --> 29:35.817
WE'RE NOT GETTING
OUR PICTURE TAKEN!

29:45.577 --> 29:46.911
HERE YOU GO.
IT'S THE LAST ONE.

29:47.078 --> 29:48.246
OH, GOOD.

29:49.706 --> 29:52.250

29:52.417 --> 29:54.252
START WITH YOURS,
THEN DO MINE.

29:54.419 --> 29:55.336
HOW'S NEXT WEEK SUIT YOU?

29:55.503 --> 29:58.423
WELL, I ALREADY
STARTED ON MINE.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.467
IT'S TOO MUCH WORK
FOR ONE MAN.

30:00.633 --> 30:01.885
WHY'D YOU START WITHOUT ME?

30:02.051 --> 30:03.928
AH, BEEN WORKING
WITH FRED WILSON.

30:04.095 --> 30:06.055

WELL, WHAT ABOUT
OUR DEAL?

30:09.225 --> 30:10.935
WELL I FIGURED,
WITH ALL YOUR MONEY,

30:11.102 --> 30:15.773
YOU'D BE HIRING SOMEBODY

OF PAYMENT IS MADE SOON.

44:25.956 --> 44:27.916
CAN WE TALK TO
YOU AND CAROLINE
FOR A MINUTE?

44:29.626 --> 44:31.086
COME IN.

44:44.141 --> 44:47.936
Jonathan: WE WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT EVERYTHING
WENT IN THE AUCTION.

44:51.607 --> 44:53.233
I BOUGHT YOUR FARM.

44:57.154 --> 44:58.447
I'D HAVE FELT A LOT
BETTER ABOUT IT

44:58.614 --> 45:00.199
IF A STRANGER
HAD BOUGHT IT.

45:01.825 --> 45:03.994
WELL, I COULDN'T
TURN IT DOWN, CHARLES.

45:04.161 --> 45:06.163
I ONLY HAD TO PAY
TWO CENTS FOR IT.

45:09.166 --> 45:10.793
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT,
TWO CENTS?

45:10.959 --> 45:12.753
WELL, IT WAS THE SAME PRICE
FOR YOUR TOOLBOX,

45:12.920 --> 45:16.673
AND THE REVEREND HERE,
HE BOUGHT YOUR TEAM.

45:16.840 --> 45:19.134
WE DIDN'T
LET ANYBODY IN FROM
OUTSIDE WALNUT GROVE.

45:19.301 --> 45:21.970
NELS THOUGHT OF THAT.
HE STOOD OUT ON
THE MAIN ROAD

45:22.137 --> 45:24.056
AND TOLD EVERYBODY
THE SALE WAS OFF.

45:24.223 --> 45:27.518
WELL, WE FIGURED IT ALL
COMES TO ABOUT 6 CENTS

45:27.684 --> 45:28.852
IF YOU WANT TO BUY
IT BACK,

45:29.019 --> 45:31.980
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT YOUR CASH,

45:32.147 --> 45:34.233
BECAUSE YOUR CREDIT'S
GOOD WITH US, CHARLES.

45:34.400 --> 45:37.194
I'M SURE
THE CONGREGATION
WILL DIG DEEP

45:37.361 --> 45:38.862
WHEN THEY HEAR
THE ORGAN
PLAYING.

45:39.029 --> 45:41.657
AND IT'S THE DUTY
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD
TO BUY THE NEW BOOKS,

45:41.824 --> 45:43.450
SO WE'RE GOING
TO DO IT.

45:43.617 --> 45:46.745
Baker: NELS SAID
THE REST COULD WAIT UNTIL
YOU'RE BACK ON YOUR FEET.

45:46.912 --> 45:48.789
HE KNOWS YOU'LL WORK IT OUT.

45:58.465 --> 45:59.800
I, UH...

46:02.094 --> 46:04.888
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

46:05.055 --> 46:07.391
THEN DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

46:07.558 --> 46:09.143
LET US.

46:09.309 --> 46:11.061
WE'RE SORRY.

46:13.021 --> 46:14.898
ALL OF US, CHARLES.

46:15.065 --> 46:17.359
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T
YOU THAT CHANGED.

46:17.526 --> 46:19.069
IT WAS...

46:19.236 --> 46:21.029
IT WAS ALL OF US
AROUND YOU.

46:22.072 --> 46:23.574
Jonathan:
I THINK WE'RE ALL

46:23.740 --> 46:26.452
ALMOST BACK
TO NORMAL NOW.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.345
AW...HEY.

46:45.512 --> 46:47.473
[LAUGHING]

46:56.565 --> 46:57.941
I NEEDED IT.

46:59.902 --> 47:02.237
I'M BACK TO NORMAL, TOO.

47:02.404 --> 47:05.157
YOU WANT TO GO WORK
ON OUR CLUBHOUSE?

47:05.324 --> 47:06.742
I SURE DO.

47:17.753 --> 47:19.296
HOW'S IT GOING?

47:19.463 --> 47:21.465
FINE. HOW'S IT LOOK?

47:21.632 --> 47:24.760
I THINK IT LOOKS RICH.

47:24.927 --> 47:27.304
YEAH,
I THINK SO, TOO.
