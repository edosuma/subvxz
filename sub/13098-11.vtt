(woman on TV)
'Rumors are still
running rampant in Earth Dome'

00:09.458 --> 00:11.250
'as President Luis Santiago'

00:11.333 --> 00:14.042
'continues his journey
to Babylon 5.'

00:14.125 --> 00:15.917
'Well, the president
is scheduled to present'

00:16.000 --> 00:17.917
'a new fighter wing
to the station.'

00:18.000 --> 00:20.250
Many believe his real reason
for the visit

00:20.333 --> 00:22.792
is to build support
for his new alien immigration

00:22.875 --> 00:24.333
and trade agreements

00:24.417 --> 00:27.750
which have met with strong
opposition of the senate.

(man on PA)
'This is a low-gravity area'

00:30.250 --> 00:31.875
'please hold handrails
at all the times..'

00:31.958 --> 00:33.792
Has president's staff given us
his itinerary yet?

00:33.875 --> 00:35.083
No, they feel it'll be safer

00:35.167 --> 00:36.750
if no one knows his plan
to the last minute.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.208
Sure that way they can blame us
if things goes wrong.

00:39.292 --> 00:40.750
Exactly.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.708
If you ask me,
this whole damn luau

00:52.792 --> 00:54.292
is a waste of time and money.

00:54.375 --> 00:57.583
Well, we are getting a new
fighter wing out of this luau.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.792
Fighters we should have had
two years ago.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.208
Now we have to renovate
old Cobra Bays

01:01.292 --> 01:02.833
that haven't been
maintained in all that time.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.792
With untrained crews
at a quarter of the time

01:04.875 --> 01:07.625
than they should have for a job
this big, at our expense.

01:07.708 --> 01:10.292
What, something about this
surprise you, Mr. Garibaldi?

01:10.375 --> 01:13.208
Nothing the government
does surprises me.

01:13.292 --> 01:16.250
That's a very Russian attitude.
I commend you.

01:16.333 --> 01:19.167
(woman on PA)
'Cobra Bay zone.
Watch your step, please.'

01:19.250 --> 01:21.250
'Blue zone, next stop.'

[explosion]

01:35.375 --> 01:36.625
What the hell?

01:38.958 --> 01:40.625
Cobra Bay 12 explosion!

01:42.417 --> 01:43.583
Drop pressure doors!

01:48.667 --> 01:50.500
Oh, my God!

01:53.792 --> 01:57.625
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

01:57.708 --> 02:00.417
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.208
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.292
Its goal,
to prevent another war

02:06.375 --> 02:08.833
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

02:08.917 --> 02:11.500
could work out their
differences peacefully.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.667
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:14.750 --> 02:16.375
for diplomats, hustlers

02:16.458 --> 02:19.750
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.458
Humans and aliens, wrapped in

02:21.542 --> 02:24.208
Two million,
five hundred thousand tons

02:24.292 --> 02:26.167
of spinning metal.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.042
all alone in the night.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.542
It can be a dangerous place.

02:31.625 --> 02:34.583
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

02:34.667 --> 02:38.708
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon Stations.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.167
The year is 2258.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.667
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

[theme music]

03:23.917 --> 03:25.208
(Franklin)
'He was blown out of the bay'

03:25.292 --> 03:26.750
'before the pressure door's
dropped.'

03:26.833 --> 03:29.167
It's the only reason
he survived.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.292
If you call this is survival.

03:30.375 --> 03:33.125
- Did he say anything?
- No.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.708
Present condition,
any procedure I might

03:34.792 --> 03:36.667
use to rouse him
would kill him.

03:38.042 --> 03:40.292
Here's the damage report.
We've sealed the Bay.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.333
But you can pull what's left
fits in a shot glass.

03:42.417 --> 03:45.208
Best guess as to what caused
the explosion?

03:45.292 --> 03:47.167
Hard to say, monitoring
equipment and controls

03:47.250 --> 03:50.125
were destroyed in the blast,
knocked ship's censors off line.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.083
Could be a wildfire
anti-proton reaction.

03:52.167 --> 03:53.625
'The crew was using
heavy cutters.'

03:53.708 --> 03:56.333
That would be consistent
with the injuries.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.708
Some poor slob probably
forgot to close the dampers

03:58.792 --> 03:59.958
on the plasma driver.

04:00.042 --> 04:02.125
Then you're ruling out sabotage?

04:02.208 --> 04:03.875
I never rule out sabotage.

04:03.958 --> 04:05.167
But those crew
weren't experienced

04:05.250 --> 04:06.458
and they've been working
around the clock.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.833
That's inviting an accident.

04:07.917 --> 04:10.833
Until I can do better
than a guess, that's..

04:10.917 --> 04:12.500
Sinclair.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.125
Commander, a Major Lianna Kemmer
of the President's

04:14.208 --> 04:15.750
security staff has arrived.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.500
She requests an immediate
briefing on the Bay explosion.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.500
Lianna?

04:20.583 --> 04:23.417
Security central,
five minutes. Let's go.

04:28.292 --> 04:31.500
- You know this Major Kemmer?
- Knew her, 17 years ago.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.542
Dad was a friend.
She was a real sweet kid.

04:36.333 --> 04:39.250
[beeping]

04:42.917 --> 04:44.042
Lianna?

04:45.875 --> 04:47.083
Michael.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.458
Major Kemmer.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.208
- Commander Sinclair.
- Pleasure, commander.

04:55.292 --> 04:56.958
Now, about this incident
at the Cobra Bays?

04:57.042 --> 04:59.000
Mr. Garibaldi is heading
the investigation

04:59.083 --> 05:01.042
and I'm sure he'll be happy
to fill you in.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.125
With all due respect,
I prefer my own team handle it.

05:04.208 --> 05:05.833
- That's up to Mister--
- Commander.

05:05.917 --> 05:07.417
As chief
of presidential security

05:07.500 --> 05:09.958
I have the authority to take
over this investigation

05:10.042 --> 05:12.625
with or without
your permission.

05:12.708 --> 05:15.292
I would much rather my report
reflected full cooperation

05:15.375 --> 05:17.167
on your part.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.500
Let her have it.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.750
I've got better things to do.

05:21.833 --> 05:24.125
[dramatic music]

05:27.458 --> 05:30.333
[indistinct chatter over PA]

05:37.333 --> 05:38.625
Garibaldi?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.667
What's going on
between you and this major?

05:43.750 --> 05:44.875
It's personal.

05:44.958 --> 05:46.417
Not when it affects
this station.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.458
Commander Sinclair, have you
seen the proposed seating chart

05:49.542 --> 05:50.667
for your president's banquet?

05:50.750 --> 05:52.125
Not now, ambassador.

05:52.208 --> 05:55.083
But the entire Narn delegation
has been seated

05:55.167 --> 05:57.000
next to the Vree!

05:57.083 --> 05:59.125
An intolerable situation.

05:59.208 --> 06:02.167
Have you seen them eat?
That's horror for you.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.708
- Eight credits?
- 'Yes, sir, that's good.'

06:04.792 --> 06:06.417
- For these?
- 'Huh?'

06:06.500 --> 06:08.833
I think it's a very good price
for the best at Babylon 5.

06:13.125 --> 06:14.708
Hey, pal, keep an eye
on your credits.

06:14.792 --> 06:15.917
Yes, sir.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.167
Third time this month I caught

06:17.250 --> 06:18.458
you pulling this crap, Dagool!

06:19.500 --> 06:20.833
What is it with you?

06:20.917 --> 06:22.958
This is a deliberate
slap in the face

06:23.042 --> 06:25.625
to the entire Narn regime!

06:25.708 --> 06:28.167
[grunting]

06:29.917 --> 06:32.458
All that tattoo ink
seeping into your brain.

06:32.542 --> 06:33.958
You think I've nothing better
to do than

06:34.042 --> 06:36.625
bust you every few days? Do you?

06:36.708 --> 06:39.417
- Excuse me.
- But..

06:39.500 --> 06:42.292
- Answer me!
- Garibaldi, that's enough!

06:42.375 --> 06:44.375
- The hell it is!
- Get out!

06:47.708 --> 06:50.083
[breathing heavily]

06:52.000 --> 06:54.958
Alright, Michael, talk to me.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.333
I got mad, okay?

06:58.417 --> 07:01.000
Hull-rats like Dagool
do that to me sometimes.

07:02.167 --> 07:05.708
Man, I need a drink.
Water, straight up.

07:07.083 --> 07:10.250
This isn't about Dagool.
Tell me what happened.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.458
17 years ago,
I was working security

07:15.542 --> 07:18.000
for the ice-mining
operation on Europa.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.625
A real cesspool.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.917
Murders, theft,
dust peddling, you name it.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.292
Half the command staff
was on the take

07:23.375 --> 07:25.458
and the other half
didn't give a damn.

07:25.542 --> 07:26.917
Except for me.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.167
Ever try to uphold the law
when nobody cares?

07:31.250 --> 07:33.000
'After a few weeks
I started drinking hard'

07:33.083 --> 07:34.542
'just to get through the night.'

07:35.458 --> 07:37.500
Then I met Frank Kemmer.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.958
He was a shuttle pilot
on the Jovian moon run.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.667
A real decent guy.

07:44.458 --> 07:48.125
When the job got tough, I spent
time with him and his family.

07:48.208 --> 07:52.875
That's when I first met Lianna.
Uncle Mike, she used to call me.

07:52.958 --> 07:58.500
With all the madness, it kept me
sane and sober for a while.

07:58.583 --> 07:59.833
What happened?

07:59.917 --> 08:01.750
'I was starting to make
a dent in the rackets.'

08:01.833 --> 08:04.125
It got under somebody's skin.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.292
Word came down, they were
gonna try and take me out.

08:07.375 --> 08:11.208
'I thought I could handle it.
I was wrong.'

08:11.292 --> 08:12.583
'Instead of coming at me
head-on'

08:12.667 --> 08:15.333
'they rigged the shuttle pad.'

08:15.417 --> 08:17.667
Frank was bringing
in the last run of the day.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.208
Just as he touched down..

08:22.042 --> 08:23.542
...it blew.

08:23.625 --> 08:26.167
You could see the fireball
for a mile in every direction.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.000
- I'm sorry.
- They had it all figured.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.083
Pinned it on my negligence.

08:34.167 --> 08:35.417
The corps didn't want a scandal

08:35.500 --> 08:36.792
so they hushed it up
and blackballed me

08:36.875 --> 08:38.292
throughout the system.

08:41.292 --> 08:42.542
But none of that
was as bad as telling

08:42.625 --> 08:44.583
Frank's family
what had happened.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.292
Lianna didn't even cry.

08:49.958 --> 08:51.833
She just died inside.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.375
And you?

08:55.458 --> 08:57.333
I crawled back into the bottle.

09:00.292 --> 09:03.417
I didn't come out again
for a long, long time.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.417
Yes?

09:07.500 --> 09:08.708
(Franklin)
'Commander, it's Dr. Franklin.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.708
I need you in Medlab
immediately.'

09:17.625 --> 09:21.125
Look, government agent or not,
you have no right to do this.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.958
That man is my patient,
He's in critical condition

09:23.042 --> 09:24.167
I have to get to him.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.833
I take my orders
from Major Kemmer.

09:30.042 --> 09:31.875
[groaning]

09:34.500 --> 09:36.083
Nolan, do you hear me?

09:37.875 --> 09:40.958
- What? Who?
- I'm Major Lianna Kemmer.

09:41.042 --> 09:44.000
I wanna know about
the explosion in Cobra Bay 12.

09:44.083 --> 09:48.292
No accident. Bomb.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.208
Who was behind it, Nolan?

09:51.458 --> 09:52.833
What's going on here?

09:52.917 --> 09:55.292
They're trying to revive Nolan.
They'll kill him.

09:56.292 --> 09:57.833
Get out of my way, or by God

09:57.917 --> 09:59.958
I'll shove you
out the nearest airlock.

10:04.792 --> 10:07.708
Who was behind it, Nolan?
Who was behind it, Nolan?

10:07.792 --> 10:10.125
Major Kemmer!
Are you out of your mind?

10:10.208 --> 10:12.250
- Stop this at once!
- No.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.042
That accident was deliberate,
commander

10:14.125 --> 10:15.958
and this man knows
who's responsible.

10:17.042 --> 10:19.833
Nolan, who planted the bomb?

10:19.917 --> 10:22.958
- Nolan, who did it?
- We're losing him!

10:23.042 --> 10:26.208
Nolan, who planted the bomb?

10:26.292 --> 10:31.292
It was Garibaldi.

10:37.958 --> 10:39.542
He's dead.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.750
[intense music]

10:51.250 --> 10:54.333
- Are you nuts? He was lying!
- Why would a dying man lie?

10:54.417 --> 10:56.667
I busted him a few months ago
for trashing an alien shop.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.042
He had it in for me.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.375
And our initial scans show
no trace of a bomb.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.667
The explosion of the plasma
drive might have covered it.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.875
Or maybe you didn't
want to find it.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.250
I don't have to listen to this!

11:07.333 --> 11:08.583
Hold on, Michael.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.417
In light of this information,
commander

11:10.500 --> 11:12.625
I want Mr. Garibaldi suspended
immediately.

11:12.708 --> 11:15.208
Major Kemmer, all you have
at the moment is a name.

11:15.292 --> 11:19.542
A name spoken by a dying man!
A man whose death you caused!

11:19.625 --> 11:21.208
The medical log stated
death was certain

11:21.292 --> 11:23.500
and he was a material witness
in a case involving

11:23.583 --> 11:26.417
presidential security, I am well
within my authority, commander.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.250
Mr. Garibaldi
has been implicated

11:28.333 --> 11:29.625
in a possible sabotage attempt

11:29.708 --> 11:31.625
suspension is standard
procedure!

11:33.000 --> 11:34.417
In light
of the president's arrival

11:34.500 --> 11:36.333
I will assume command
of security in his place.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.958
Oh, give me a break, will you?

11:39.042 --> 11:41.958
Presidential authority gives
me the right, commander.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.208
I'm exercising it.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.333
Don't do this, Jeff.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.792
Mike.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.958
I'll need your security
authorization

12:02.042 --> 12:04.833
your link and your sidearm.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.000
Sorry, chief, can't let you in.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.750
You gone space happy, Lou?
This is my place.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.667
It's under seizure.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.167
Lianna, let's cut through this.
We need to talk!

12:40.250 --> 12:42.583
- I don't think so.
- Wait a minute!

12:42.667 --> 12:45.250
No, no. No!
Chief, don't! This won't help.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.667
Go find out what
the scanning team has turned up.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.333
Next time, Garibaldi.

12:54.417 --> 12:55.625
Welch.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.000
Alright,
say what you have to say.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.625
Lianna, I loved Frank
like he was my own brother.

13:06.708 --> 13:08.000
When he died--

13:08.083 --> 13:09.500
Because you were protecting
yourself.

13:09.583 --> 13:13.542
No, I made a mistake,
I know that.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.750
But I would never have let
your father die to save myself.

13:16.833 --> 13:18.833
'You've got to believe that.'

13:18.917 --> 13:23.708
I might, if you had told me then
but you just got drunk and ran.

13:23.792 --> 13:28.125
Like you always do. And I never
saw my father's face again.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.042
Major, the scanning team
just linked in.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.583
It was a bomb alright.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.917
The scan had showed traces
of C15 in the burn residues

13:37.000 --> 13:39.708
and Chang found
schematics of the Cobra Bay

13:40.750 --> 13:44.708
and these,
hidden in his quarters.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.875
When did they start paying
Earthforce security chiefs

13:46.958 --> 13:48.833
in Centauri ducats?

13:48.917 --> 13:50.875
How much would you say this is
worth, Mr. Garibaldi?

13:50.958 --> 13:52.833
One hundred thousand
credits, maybe more?

13:52.917 --> 13:54.458
Come on, Lianna,
this is a frame.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.750
If I were guilty,
why would I leave the evidence

13:55.833 --> 13:56.833
in my own quarters?

13:56.917 --> 13:58.208
Maybe you just made
another mistake

13:58.292 --> 13:59.625
just you did 17 years ago!

13:59.708 --> 14:01.500
Mr. Cutter, take Mr. Garibaldi
into custody.

14:01.583 --> 14:04.208
The charge is conspiracy
to commit sabotage.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.792
[dramatic music]

14:06.875 --> 14:08.333
Stop!

14:08.417 --> 14:09.625
After him!

14:11.542 --> 14:14.667
Commander, security is posting
a station wide fugitive alert.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.458
It's for Mr. Garibaldi.

14:17.833 --> 14:19.125
What?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.417
Cancel that alert!

14:23.500 --> 14:25.583
You can't do that, commander,
I have hard evidence

14:25.667 --> 14:27.333
that Garibaldi
is part of this sabotage.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.333
I want him in custody
before the president arrives.

14:29.417 --> 14:32.208
Mr. Garibaldi is many things,
but he's no saboteur.

14:32.292 --> 14:34.917
And I've had it up to here with
this personal vendetta of yours.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.375
- Kill that alert.
- Yes, sir.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.500
Ivanov to all security posts

14:37.583 --> 14:38.917
cancel fugitive alert
immediately.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.542
If you insist
on obstructing me, commander

14:40.625 --> 14:42.458
I have no choice but to invoke
presidential authority--

14:42.542 --> 14:44.625
And I'm sick of that too!
This is my station.

14:44.708 --> 14:46.125
And it's time you realize that.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.583
Lieutenant Commander Ivanova,
escort Major Kemmer

14:48.667 --> 14:49.958
off the Observation Dome.

14:50.042 --> 14:51.667
With pleasure.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.583
You are going to resist, I hope?

14:59.208 --> 15:00.167
She's going to
call Earth Central

15:00.250 --> 15:01.667
and you know what they'll say.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.583
- It'll buy me a little time.
- To do what?

15:03.667 --> 15:06.333
Find Garibaldi before Kemmer
and her hounds do.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.125
Station One.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.583
Commence level 6
maintenance check

15:13.667 --> 15:15.667
on all off station
communications channels.

15:15.750 --> 15:19.000
Lieutenant Commander, that'll
tie up communications for hours.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.500
Yes, I believe it will.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.208
[indistinct chatter]

15:23.292 --> 15:25.292
[trilling]

15:41.750 --> 15:44.958
- Londo, don't turn around.
- Mr. Garibaldi.

15:45.042 --> 15:48.625
- Try not to draw any attention.
- You're out of uniform.

15:48.708 --> 15:49.792
Very dapper.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, when you steal,
you don't have choice.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.000
I thought about borrowing a few
of your things, but..

15:54.083 --> 15:56.208
I'm really not in the mood
for any of your little

15:56.292 --> 15:57.625
games right now.

15:57.708 --> 16:00.083
Tough. I need information.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.875
Someone's trying to frame me
for the explosion

16:01.958 --> 16:03.167
of the Cobra Bay.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.542
They planted
a schematic of the bay

16:04.625 --> 16:07.292
and a pouch of Centauri ducats
in my quarters.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.708
Centauri?

16:09.792 --> 16:12.292
Mr. Garibaldi,
do you really think

16:12.375 --> 16:15.042
that I would do
such a thing to you

16:15.125 --> 16:16.875
my good and dear friend?

16:16.958 --> 16:18.333
In a minute.

16:19.542 --> 16:21.708
You're right, but I didn't.

16:22.833 --> 16:26.250
Though I may have an idea
who did.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.875
Lt. Commander,
why are all Com Channels

16:30.958 --> 16:32.042
to Earth offline?

16:32.125 --> 16:33.583
Maintenance check,
we wouldn't want

16:33.667 --> 16:35.708
the president to be out of touch
when he gets here.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.917
I demand you open a channel
to Earth at once.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.125
I'm a Lt. Commander
in Earthforce, major

16:40.208 --> 16:41.833
I do not take demands.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.750
If you ever request,
I'll consider it.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.250
Very well, then.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.583
I request that you
open a channel to Earth Dome.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.167
Request denied. Have a nice day.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.917
[sighs]

16:56.250 --> 16:57.292
She and Sinclair
doing everything

16:57.375 --> 16:59.000
they can to protect Garibaldi.

16:59.083 --> 17:02.208
No, surprise, according to our
files, they're his only friends.

17:02.292 --> 17:05.125
Them and the Centauri
ambassador.

17:05.208 --> 17:06.583
Better question the ambassador.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.500
There might be a connection.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.250
O'Connor, get back to the ship

17:10.333 --> 17:11.417
and patch me through
to Earthforce One

17:11.500 --> 17:12.875
Director General Netter.

17:12.958 --> 17:14.583
They should be close enough
to pick up the signal.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.208
Yes, major.

17:16.292 --> 17:19.583
So how would G'Kar get his hands
on a a load of Centauri ducats?

17:19.667 --> 17:22.250
During the Narn occupation
of Ragesh III

17:22.333 --> 17:26.917
some important scientific
material was lost.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.375
For the right amount
it could be found again, yes?

17:30.458 --> 17:33.958
But the Narns insisted
on hard currency.

17:34.042 --> 17:36.125
Now, you could ask
him yourself, except

17:36.208 --> 17:39.458
however, getting
into the Ambassadorial Wing

17:39.542 --> 17:40.917
requires high level clearance

17:41.000 --> 17:43.292
which I believe
you no longer have.

17:43.375 --> 17:48.125
I can handle that,
if you could float me a loan.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.458
Who would have thought it?

17:49.542 --> 17:54.292
[laughing]
You, borrowing money from me.

17:54.375 --> 17:58.917
Luckily for you, Ilaros has
smiled on me recently.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.250
Ilaros?

18:01.333 --> 18:04.708
Goddess of luck.
Patron of gamblers.

18:04.792 --> 18:09.417
She and I have had a long
and rather dubious relationship.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.958
Five hundred Centauri ducats.

18:13.042 --> 18:15.000
That should buy you
whatever you need.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.458
You're being awfully generous.
Any particular reason?

18:18.542 --> 18:21.167
You're a very suspicious man,
Garibaldi.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.000
But, yes, there is a reason.

18:25.417 --> 18:28.708
We are alike, you and I.

18:28.792 --> 18:32.208
We are both, as you say

18:32.833 --> 18:36.000
the odd man out.

18:36.083 --> 18:38.667
I have been in your place.

18:38.750 --> 18:42.000
I can feel how you are pinned.

18:42.083 --> 18:45.500
And it would give me
some small pleasure to know

18:45.583 --> 18:50.667
that things can work out,
even for us.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.917
Now, go, please.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.542
Leave me in peace.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.500
You're alright, Londo.

19:02.583 --> 19:07.292
If they catch you, I will deny
ever seeing you. Good luck.

19:13.792 --> 19:16.083
Yes, and you'll need good luck.

19:23.625 --> 19:26.167
[dramatic music]

19:33.458 --> 19:35.417
In here, Mr. Garibaldi.

19:40.917 --> 19:43.292
I heard you were
coming this way.

19:43.375 --> 19:44.958
I thought we might chat.

19:45.042 --> 19:47.333
Don't take too long.
This whole wing is monitored.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.042
Security will
probably here in any minute.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.792
Oh, don't worry,
I fear the monitors

19:50.875 --> 19:52.667
are malfunctioning
at the moment.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.333
I also took
the liberty of mentioning

19:54.417 --> 19:58.083
to the guard that I thought
I'd seen you in the next level.

19:58.167 --> 20:01.292
My, my, my, you look
as if you could use a drink.

20:01.375 --> 20:04.250
This Taree is most potent.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.583
No, thanks, but you can tell me
how you knew I was coming.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.542
Oh, you've been talking
to Mollari.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.792
It was inevitable
he would sent you to me.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.125
- How?
- Oh, my people watch him.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.542
His people watch me.

20:15.625 --> 20:19.417
We all watch
one another here, Mr. Garibaldi.

20:19.500 --> 20:23.417
I assume Mollari blamed me
for your current situation.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.542
It makes sense.
We've locked horns before.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.625
Maybe you saw this is a chance
to even the score.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.917
Granted, it's not a bad idea

20:30.000 --> 20:33.125
but I didn't think of it
and I didn't do it.

20:33.208 --> 20:35.500
Every Centauri ducat
that Mollari's people

20:35.583 --> 20:37.208
contribute
to the Narn government

20:37.292 --> 20:39.292
has been accounted for.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.958
You're welcome to check the
accounts personally if you like.

20:42.042 --> 20:43.583
I'll take your word for it.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.083
I have been following your
current plight

20:50.167 --> 20:52.625
with great interest,
Mr. Garibaldi.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.708
Is that so?
I didn't know you cared.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.333
Personally, I don't.

20:56.417 --> 20:59.708
But I've always had the greatest
respect for your talents.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.875
I'm too tired
for dancing, G'Kar.

21:02.958 --> 21:04.667
What would you say
if I told you that a ship

21:04.750 --> 21:07.833
stands ready to spirit you away
to Narn space?

21:07.917 --> 21:09.250
I'd say, why?

21:09.333 --> 21:12.000
Oh, you could serve us
in any number of ways.

21:12.083 --> 21:15.417
Analyst, security expert,
cryptographer.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.375
And If you should grow homesick,
in time

21:17.458 --> 21:20.458
I'm sure we could arrange
for your return to Human Space

21:20.542 --> 21:22.833
with proper genetic alterations

21:22.917 --> 21:25.167
and that too
might serve our needs.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.375
You want me
to betray my own world?

21:27.458 --> 21:31.833
Stop seeing things
in such absolute terms.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.667
The universe is run by
the complex interweaving

21:34.750 --> 21:36.083
of three elements.

21:36.167 --> 21:40.167
Energy, matter
and enlightened self-interest.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.417
Unless you comprehend that fact

21:42.500 --> 21:46.083
and soon, you will
be cornered and caged.

21:46.167 --> 21:48.167
They will destroy you.

21:48.250 --> 21:51.125
- Maybe I'd rather be dead.
- They won't give you death.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.750
They'll just take
everything you value.

21:52.833 --> 21:53.958
And leave you with nothing.

21:54.042 --> 21:55.542
No deal.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.917
As you wish, though you are
of course, being a fool.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.583
Without your position, this
station is not safe for you.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.458
You have made many enemies.

22:02.542 --> 22:04.083
Call it a lifestyle.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.875
We'll see.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.208
[buzzing]

22:18.208 --> 22:20.500
(Ivanova)
'Welcome to Babylon 5, Zeta
Wing, you're clear for entry.'

22:20.583 --> 22:23.083
'We've cleared
all of the traffic.'

22:23.167 --> 22:25.375
(male #1)
'Babylon 5, this is Zeta Wing'

22:25.458 --> 22:27.167
'we're awaiting
your instructions.'

22:29.667 --> 22:31.083
(Ivanova)
'Proceed through
central docking hub.'

22:31.167 --> 22:32.917
Your ships will be routed
to Cobra Arm 3

22:33.000 --> 22:35.958
where they'll be permanently
stationed, following the flyby.

22:36.042 --> 22:38.833
[whirring]

22:47.583 --> 22:49.375
Hey, look, N'Grath,
we both know you can fix

22:49.458 --> 22:51.042
about anything on this station.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.917
I need access to restricted
sectors

22:53.000 --> 22:54.500
and I'm gonna
prove my innocence.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.833
A high level security card

22:55.917 --> 22:57.625
shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

22:57.708 --> 23:01.125
I fix nothing. I do business.

23:01.208 --> 23:05.083
- Legitimate business.
- You don't trust me, do you?

23:05.167 --> 23:08.542
- You are police.
- Not anymore. I'm a fugitive.

23:08.625 --> 23:10.292
Don't tell me you haven't heard?

23:10.375 --> 23:14.417
Have heard.
You are still police.

23:14.500 --> 23:18.667
No sale. Go. Now!

23:18.750 --> 23:20.292
Get your hands off me.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.542
I guess I'll be leaving now. Hm?

23:28.833 --> 23:30.042
[grunts]

23:31.292 --> 23:32.625
- Damn!
- Halt!

23:32.708 --> 23:34.417
[gunshot]

23:40.667 --> 23:42.042
Where the hell did he go?

23:48.292 --> 23:50.375
[whirring]

24:09.833 --> 24:12.875
[dramatic music]

24:32.000 --> 24:34.375
[grunting]

24:50.792 --> 24:53.625
[grunting]

24:59.458 --> 25:01.875
[groaning]

25:04.792 --> 25:07.458
[screaming]

25:13.417 --> 25:15.917
Right. Let's do it.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.458
[grunting]

25:25.375 --> 25:27.333
[grunting]

25:38.750 --> 25:40.042
[panting]

25:41.833 --> 25:43.125
Jeff, what are you doing here?

25:43.208 --> 25:45.375
Trying to keep you
from frying your own butt.

25:45.458 --> 25:47.042
Luckily, I monitored
the security reports

25:47.125 --> 25:48.917
on your whereabouts.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.542
So you missed most of the fun.

25:50.625 --> 25:52.292
If I'd missed any more of the
fun, you'd be a smear on the

25:52.375 --> 25:54.000
floor, I've gotta
get you to Medlab.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.792
I'm not going anywhere till
I find out who framed me.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.792
Michael, you can't do it alone.

25:57.875 --> 25:59.167
If I have to, I'll die trying.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.625
I can't let you do that!

26:01.708 --> 26:03.292
Sinclair.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.125
(Ivanova)
'Commander, you have a gold
priority transmission'

26:05.208 --> 26:06.583
'from General Netter.'

26:08.167 --> 26:09.292
On my way.

26:10.208 --> 26:11.375
Michael..

26:12.125 --> 26:13.458
Garibaldi?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.042
[intense music]

26:21.917 --> 26:24.167
[steam hissing]

26:52.500 --> 26:55.083
(female #1)
'Earthforce One approaching
vortex generator.'

26:55.167 --> 26:56.500
'Prepare for jump.'

26:59.458 --> 27:01.833
[dramatic music]

27:03.917 --> 27:06.167
And from here on in,
you and your staff

27:06.250 --> 27:08.292
ought to give Major Kemmer
full cooperation.

27:08.375 --> 27:10.125
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

27:10.208 --> 27:12.083
I expect everything's
to be secure

27:12.167 --> 27:15.000
when the president's entourage
comes out the other side.

27:18.958 --> 27:21.667
I trust our positions are now
clear, Commander Sinclair?

27:21.750 --> 27:24.083
I want to find Garibaldi
as much as you do.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.375
The only difference is,
I haven't already judged him.

27:26.458 --> 27:28.708
- I resent your implication.
- That's your privilege.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.333
But the fact is Garibaldi
is as loyal as you are.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.167
And if you weren't so twisted up
inside about what happened

27:33.250 --> 27:35.292
to your father,
you'd realize that.

27:35.375 --> 27:38.833
It's not justice you're after,
major, it's blood.

27:39.708 --> 27:40.875
Kemmer here.

27:40.958 --> 27:42.042
(Cutter)
'Major, we've got a sighting'

27:42.125 --> 27:43.042
'on Garibaldi.'

27:43.125 --> 27:44.500
'Ground 5, level 3.'

27:44.583 --> 27:45.792
'And we found out
he's been paying'

27:45.875 --> 27:48.458
'for things
with Centauri ducats.'

27:48.542 --> 27:50.083
Apparently,
what we found in his quarters

27:50.167 --> 27:52.167
was only part of his payoff.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.875
Close in. I'm on the way.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.000
Commander.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.750
Appears Garibaldi's
running out of luck.

28:00.833 --> 28:03.875
Have all personnel prepare
for the president's arrival.

28:03.958 --> 28:07.208
Security, patch me through
to Officer Lou Welch.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.292
[indistinct chatter]

28:09.375 --> 28:10.750
He may be
in some sort of disguise

28:10.833 --> 28:13.333
If you see him, he's considered
dangerous. Just call us.

28:13.417 --> 28:15.208
- Yeah. No, no, no.
- Don't try to apprehend..

28:21.500 --> 28:22.875
Open the damn door.

28:22.958 --> 28:25.000
[intense music]

28:38.750 --> 28:41.792
[indistinct chatter]

29:25.042 --> 29:27.458
- Thanks, pal.
- No want hat?

29:28.667 --> 29:30.667
Take bottle. Huh?

29:30.750 --> 29:32.250
[chuckles]

29:33.792 --> 29:35.458
I go casino.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.917
[indistinct chatter]

30:40.208 --> 30:42.042
And then she said to me

30:42.125 --> 30:45.917
if I could do that, I wouldn't
need an encounter suit.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.250
[laughs]

30:48.500 --> 30:50.375
[scoffs]
Guess you had to be there.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.250
Is there a back
way out of here?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.417
Whoa, whoa.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.250
Go easy, Michael.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.500
Whoo!

31:15.250 --> 31:18.125
You got a real
nice place here.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.083
[laughing]

31:21.458 --> 31:25.042
Great ambience,
terrific decor

31:25.125 --> 31:27.167
friendly people!
Ha-ha-ha!

31:27.250 --> 31:30.458
Yeah, this place should be
on all the charter tours.

31:30.542 --> 31:34.958
See and experience
the real Babylon 5.

31:35.042 --> 31:37.500
'Hell, in a couple of months'

31:37.583 --> 31:39.583
'I could see a few
of you people topside!'

31:39.667 --> 31:41.125
[laughs]

31:41.208 --> 31:43.167
[clattering]

31:43.250 --> 31:47.917
Well, boys and girls, it's been
a slice. I'll see you around.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.958
[laughs]

31:50.042 --> 31:51.500
Freeze!

32:00.792 --> 32:02.583
Drunk again, Uncle Mike?

32:05.083 --> 32:06.833
Drunk again, Uncle Mike?

32:06.917 --> 32:09.708
[echoing]
Uncle Mike, Uncle Mike..

32:11.458 --> 32:13.417
(Cutter)
'You don't look
so good, Garibaldi.'

32:13.500 --> 32:15.500
Take him to my command center.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.417
Major Kemmer to all units.
Blip is in custody.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.917
Abandon search.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.583
Major, they're getting ready
to launch the new fighters.

32:25.667 --> 32:28.583
I think I should check
the bays once more time.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.167
Do it!

32:31.833 --> 32:34.708
[buzzing]

32:41.167 --> 32:43.625
(Sinclair)
'Welcome to Babylon 5,
Mr. President.'

32:43.708 --> 32:45.208
You're cleared
for immediate docking.

32:45.292 --> 32:48.208
[instrumental music]

33:01.333 --> 33:03.333
You never change,
do you, Michael?

33:04.917 --> 33:06.792
I thought I had..

33:09.792 --> 33:11.708
...until you showed up.

33:11.792 --> 33:14.208
You're tired, Michael. Hm?

33:14.292 --> 33:18.125
You're hurt. Tell me
the truth and you can rest.

33:18.208 --> 33:19.833
We already have more than enough
evidence against you.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.875
Don't make it
harder on yourself.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.708
Isn't that what you want?

33:23.792 --> 33:26.292
To tear my life down like
I did yours?

33:26.375 --> 33:29.000
If I could have gone in Frank's
place, I would have.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.333
I didn't know, Lianna.

33:33.458 --> 33:35.083
I didn't know.

33:35.167 --> 33:38.417
Major Kemmer? Chief.

33:38.500 --> 33:39.750
What is it, Officer Welch?

33:40.833 --> 33:42.417
Commander Sinclair
ordered me to search

33:42.500 --> 33:44.333
Nolan's quarters.

33:44.417 --> 33:45.875
I found these.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.250
Vibration detonator.

33:49.333 --> 33:52.250
And the pamphlets,
they are Home Guard stuff.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.458
'We had a little trouble
with them a while back.'

33:54.542 --> 33:57.500
'Mr. Garibaldi cleared it up.'

33:57.583 --> 34:01.250
- Is there anything else?
- No, major, nothing else.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.583
That will be all.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.708
I should have figured it.

34:09.792 --> 34:12.167
We suspected Nolan of belonging
to some pro-Earth group

34:12.250 --> 34:13.750
but we never could prove it.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.083
And this is just
Home Guard style.

34:17.167 --> 34:20.792
Are you saying Nolan was killed
by a bomb he planted himself?

34:20.875 --> 34:23.167
Exactly, he didn't
know they'd be using

34:23.250 --> 34:25.167
a plasma driver in the bay.

34:25.250 --> 34:28.875
He created just enough vibration
to trigger the bomb prematurely.

34:28.958 --> 34:31.958
That's a possibility.
But what about motive?

34:32.042 --> 34:33.833
They say the president's gonna
announce freer alien

34:33.917 --> 34:36.250
'immigration
and trade policies.'

34:36.333 --> 34:39.125
'That would stick
in Home Guard's craw.'

34:39.208 --> 34:41.250
But how was it supposed to work?

34:43.458 --> 34:45.375
You got any breathers
or oxy pills?

34:46.833 --> 34:48.542
I'm not used
to the booze anymore.

34:49.417 --> 34:50.708
[device beeping]

34:50.792 --> 34:52.542
- Kemmer.
- 'Major?'

34:52.625 --> 34:54.500
'The president's about
to coming on board'

34:54.583 --> 34:56.750
'for the presentation ceremony.'

34:56.833 --> 34:59.375
'Uh, General Netter wants
to know if all is secure.'

34:59.458 --> 35:00.958
Make sure all
our people are in place.

35:01.042 --> 35:03.583
And tell General Netter
everything is A-okay.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.583
Lianna,
until we figure this out--

35:06.667 --> 35:08.000
We?

35:08.083 --> 35:10.167
You're still a suspect,
Garibaldi.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.750
Cutter, have you checked
the bays, yet?

35:13.833 --> 35:15.375
(Cutter)
'Affirmative. They're clean.'

35:15.458 --> 35:17.417
Guard the bay access until
the fighters are launched.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.167
And keep alert.

35:21.333 --> 35:24.250
I'd like to believe you,
Michael, but this supposition

35:24.333 --> 35:27.333
of your doesn't explain that
evidence got in your quarters.

35:27.417 --> 35:30.292
Nobody knew Nolan
had named you except you

35:30.375 --> 35:33.875
me, Dr. Franklin
and Commander Sinclair.

35:33.958 --> 35:36.500
And Cutter, who was
there when the evidence

35:36.583 --> 35:37.708
against me was found.

35:37.792 --> 35:40.000
Cutter's one of our best agents.

35:40.083 --> 35:43.167
Maybe Home Guard was
counting on that. Look.

35:45.708 --> 35:48.208
It couldn't hurt
to scan those bays yourself.

35:48.292 --> 35:49.625
You're head
of presidential security.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.375
Shouldn't you
make a personal inspection?

35:51.458 --> 35:53.125
'Just to be sure?'

35:55.792 --> 35:57.458
(woman on radio)
'Presidential shuttle launched.'

35:57.542 --> 35:59.667
'Now on approach
to docking bay one'

35:59.750 --> 36:01.583
'vector 694.'

36:10.167 --> 36:12.417
(President Luis)
'With great pleasure, I present
this new fighter wing'

36:12.500 --> 36:13.875
'to Babylon 5.'

36:13.958 --> 36:16.542
'The station's own
fighters will now join..'

36:16.625 --> 36:18.375
Illuminate
center section floods.

36:26.792 --> 36:28.042
Cutter?

36:28.125 --> 36:30.083
Major? Is something wrong?

36:30.167 --> 36:32.208
I wanna scan the bays again.

36:32.292 --> 36:34.958
You'll have to hurry. The
fighters are about to launch.

36:35.042 --> 36:37.458
- Watch him.
- My pleasure.

36:41.583 --> 36:44.667
Come on, wise guy. Do it!

36:44.750 --> 36:46.417
Prepare to drop fighters
on my mark.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.000
[machine whirring]

36:49.875 --> 36:53.125
Be smart, Cutter.
You can't pull this off.

36:53.208 --> 36:54.750
[chuckles]

36:54.833 --> 36:57.042
Oh, yes, I can.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.958
[grunting]

37:05.542 --> 37:07.792
Begin countdown
at T-minus 30 seconds.

37:07.875 --> 37:11.417
(computer)
'Commencing. T-minus thirty..'

37:11.500 --> 37:13.958
'Twenty-nine, twenty-eight'

37:14.042 --> 37:16.458
'twenty-seven, twenty-six'

37:16.542 --> 37:18.750
'twenty-five, twenty-four'

37:18.833 --> 37:21.083
'twenty-three, twenty-two..'

37:21.167 --> 37:22.708
Clear all Cobra Bays for drop.

37:22.792 --> 37:25.250
(computer)
'Twenty, nineteen'

37:25.333 --> 37:28.833
'eighteen, seventeen, sixteen..'

37:28.917 --> 37:30.875
- Ivanova, abort the drop!
- Garibaldi?

37:30.958 --> 37:33.042
- There's a bomb in the bay!
- What?

37:33.125 --> 37:35.000
- Abort the drop!
- 'Eleven..'

37:35.083 --> 37:37.417
- 'Ivanova?'
- You lose, wise guy!

37:37.500 --> 37:42.083
(computer)
'Eight, seven, six, five..'

37:42.167 --> 37:44.042
- Abort the drop!
- 'Where are you?'

37:44.125 --> 37:46.375
- Just do it!
- Freeze count!

37:46.458 --> 37:50.250
(computer)
'Holding at T-minus one.'

37:50.333 --> 37:51.375
[sighs]

37:53.375 --> 37:56.458
Hm, outside of numerous
bruises and abrasions

37:56.542 --> 37:58.750
and a blood level that's close

37:58.833 --> 38:02.458
to 100 proof, looks like
you're gonna be alright.

38:02.542 --> 38:05.208
- 'And Lianna?'
- She's already back on the job.

38:05.292 --> 38:08.708
- She's a tough customer.
- Yeah, I know.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.667
How you feeling?

38:11.750 --> 38:14.042
Like I just made love
to a meteor shower.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.542
Don't let him con you,
commander.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.875
He may not look pretty,
but with few days rest

38:17.958 --> 38:19.208
he's gonna be fit for duty.

38:19.292 --> 38:20.875
- Mm.
- Thanks a lot, doc.

38:20.958 --> 38:23.292
These bruises could have bought
me a week's leave.

38:27.083 --> 38:29.875
(Sinclair)
'We found charges
on all the bay doors.'

38:29.958 --> 38:31.542
If they'd opened, we would
have lost the whole wing

38:31.625 --> 38:33.083
and half the station with it.

38:33.167 --> 38:35.458
'We also checked on Cutter,
seems someone on Earth'

38:35.542 --> 38:37.792
deposited 100,000 credits
into an account

38:37.875 --> 38:40.625
in his name an hour
after Nolan named you.

38:40.708 --> 38:42.083
He withdrew it here and--

38:42.167 --> 38:45.542
Centauri ducats, which he
planted in my quarters..

38:45.625 --> 38:46.750
Very smooth.

38:46.833 --> 38:49.083
(Sinclair)
But not smooth enough, Michael.

38:49.167 --> 38:51.583
- You did good.
- Yeah.

38:53.125 --> 38:56.000
- Sure.
- 'Something wrong?'

38:58.958 --> 39:00.375
I blew it, Jeff.

39:01.833 --> 39:05.458
Just like I did on Europa,
on Mars Colony, Orion 4

39:05.542 --> 39:06.958
just like I always do.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.250
When things get too rough

39:09.333 --> 39:12.208
I crawl right back
into the damn bottle.

39:12.292 --> 39:14.125
It really scares me
as how much I enjoyed it.

39:14.208 --> 39:15.667
But you crawled back
out again and did the job.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.083
That's what counts.

39:17.167 --> 39:21.125
Yeah. I got lucky.
But what happens next time?

39:21.208 --> 39:23.542
Hopefully
there won't be a next time

39:23.625 --> 39:27.917
but if there is,
promise me something.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.875
You won't try
and fight the battle alone.

39:30.958 --> 39:32.917
You're more trouble
than a toilet full of snakes

39:33.000 --> 39:34.917
'but I couldn't
run this station without you.'

39:35.000 --> 39:39.125
Commander, I sense a huge
pay raise coming my way.

39:39.208 --> 39:41.208
[laughing]
Dream on.

39:43.958 --> 39:47.292
I've gotta attend
the president's reception so..

39:48.875 --> 39:50.833
'Get some rest, chief.
You've earned it.'

39:52.458 --> 39:55.833
And I think
you might want these.

39:59.917 --> 40:01.333
Hey, Jeff.

40:04.875 --> 40:05.917
Thanks.

40:14.708 --> 40:16.542
[instrumental music]

40:16.625 --> 40:18.875
(woman on TV)
'President Santiago
concluded his address'

40:18.958 --> 40:21.333
by inviting all alien
governments to work

40:21.417 --> 40:22.833
more closely with Earth.

40:22.917 --> 40:25.250
A position certain
to cause much controversy

40:25.333 --> 40:26.625
in the weeks to come.

40:30.917 --> 40:32.250
Lianna?

40:35.917 --> 40:37.667
Everything going alright
with the president's visit?

40:37.750 --> 40:40.083
Yes, thanks to you.

40:40.167 --> 40:42.667
And, uh, thanks for
that report of yours.

40:42.750 --> 40:45.292
It was very creative.

40:45.375 --> 40:47.292
The president's even
talking about citations

40:47.375 --> 40:48.667
for all concerned.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.250
I figured
if you could nab me on my turf

40:50.333 --> 40:52.250
you might just
have a career in this game.

40:53.917 --> 40:56.250
And I owe you...for Frank.

40:57.458 --> 40:58.958
I screwed up, Michael.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.500
- I'm sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about.

41:03.583 --> 41:05.708
- You did your job.
- 'No.'

41:05.792 --> 41:07.917
Commander Sinclair was right.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.500
I wasn't out for justice,
I was out for blood.

41:10.583 --> 41:14.708
It happens. To all of us.

41:14.792 --> 41:18.292
We're not machines, Lianna.
When we're hurt, we lash out.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.917
That's no excuse for what
I put you through.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.917
It's not about excuses.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.042
'17 years ago
we both died inside'

41:26.125 --> 41:27.875
but somehow we survived.

41:29.667 --> 41:32.000
For better or worse,
that's all we can do.

41:33.542 --> 41:35.375
Survive and..

41:36.167 --> 41:38.875
...maybe one day

41:38.958 --> 41:41.250
forget how much
it can hurt to be human.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.917
[device beeping]

41:43.042 --> 41:44.542
Kemmer here.

41:44.625 --> 41:47.500
(female #2)
'Major, we're cleared
for departure.'

41:47.583 --> 41:49.000
Be right there.

41:51.625 --> 41:54.917
We've got to get set up
for the president's next stop.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.292
You know, how it is
always on another assignment.

41:57.375 --> 42:00.417
Yeah. I know.

42:00.500 --> 42:02.792
I'll see you the next time
the president visits.

42:03.958 --> 42:06.167
He's fond
of Babylon 5, you know.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.500
Then make sure
nothing happens to him.

42:08.583 --> 42:10.458
We need
all the friends we can get.

42:12.167 --> 42:13.417
I will.

42:16.333 --> 42:17.958
Goodbye, Michael.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.708
[instrumental music]

42:38.333 --> 42:40.208
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

43:05.542 --> 43:08.042
[theme music]
