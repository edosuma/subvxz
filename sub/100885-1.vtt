WEBVTT

00:25.710 --> 00:26.844
No, we're almost done.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.580
Final sequence initiated.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.548
Okay.

00:31.583 --> 00:34.284
Echo Five Sierra November 273.

00:35.319 --> 00:38.388
Alpha Delta 1964

00:38.422 --> 00:40.792
Whiskey Three Foxtrot Two India.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.898
- <i>Yes, that's right.</i>
- Okay, three days.

00:46.931 --> 00:49.567
<i>This is a bad idea.
You know what they're capable of.</i>

00:49.601 --> 00:51.603
- My brother.
- <i>Not my fault.</i>

00:51.636 --> 00:53.805
- <i>They know where you are.</i>
- I cover my tracks.

00:55.172 --> 00:56.106
Execute.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.254
Yeah.

01:44.287 --> 01:46.557
It's a fine art,
and I'm really good at it.

01:48.425 --> 01:49.894
Of course I'm talking
about birding.

01:50.928 --> 01:52.429
It's peaceful.

01:54.966 --> 01:56.868
Look, I need you to understand.

01:56.901 --> 01:59.169
Actions speak louder than words.

02:00.605 --> 02:02.205
Yeah, okay, say what you want.

02:02.239 --> 02:03.641
It's what you do.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.345
No. Look, I never said
I wouldn't, but I need you...

02:09.279 --> 02:10.312
Hello?

02:11.248 --> 02:12.717
Hello? Hey, are you there?
Can you hear me?

02:22.593 --> 02:24.394
Middle of frigging nowhere.

05:14.497 --> 05:15.099
Hello?

05:26.443 --> 05:27.510
Can I help you?

05:28.713 --> 05:31.182
Yeah. Sorry, I'm just having
a little bit of car trouble.

05:31.215 --> 05:33.017
My car stalled and won't
even turn over.

05:34.151 --> 05:35.418
Why are you here?

05:35.853 --> 05:38.388
Uh, my car stalled.

05:39.023 --> 05:41.524
What I mean is,
no one lives around here.

05:41.559 --> 05:43.928
What, you visiting someone?

05:44.795 --> 05:45.830
Birding.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.430
Birding?

05:48.833 --> 05:50.067
You like birds?

05:50.101 --> 05:52.670
Well, I'm a photographer,
freelance.

05:52.703 --> 05:55.673
You know, pays the bills,
kind of love it, but not really.

05:55.706 --> 05:57.540
- What kind of birds?
- The colorful kind.

05:59.977 --> 06:00.978
Your cell?

06:01.879 --> 06:05.049
Yeah, I mean, I had
reception and then I didn't.

06:05.082 --> 06:08.451
You know, comes and goes. So, I just thought
that you might have something more stable.

06:08.485 --> 06:09.587
No.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.723
No? Okay. Um, well,

06:12.757 --> 06:14.792
Do you mind if I step inside for a
minute and just use your charger?

06:14.825 --> 06:17.128
Because the guys who sold me
this phone are total liars.

06:17.161 --> 06:19.529
They told me that I would
have reception anywhere I go

06:19.563 --> 06:21.966
with a 12-hour battery,
new technology and all that,

06:21.999 --> 06:23.834
total BS when I looked it up.

06:23.868 --> 06:25.937
And then they told me
I had the wrong model

06:25.970 --> 06:27.905
and not the newest model.

06:27.939 --> 06:29.640
They told me a hundred
lies to cover up the first.

06:29.674 --> 06:31.474
So, 12-hour battery my ass.

06:31.508 --> 06:32.442
It's more like two.

06:34.111 --> 06:35.780
You got a charger, right?

06:37.081 --> 06:39.884
- I don't own a cellphone.
- Oh.

06:40.918 --> 06:45.856
Okay. Well, I would kind of go somewhere
else, but you're the only game in town.

06:45.890 --> 06:46.958
What game?

06:48.259 --> 06:49.827
It's just an expression.

06:51.595 --> 06:52.495
Never heard of it.

06:54.865 --> 06:58.436
Okay, great. Well, I don't know,
maybe you have a neighbor?

06:59.203 --> 07:00.638
I'm going to hitchhike
or walk around.

07:00.671 --> 07:01.706
I'll figure it out.

07:02.940 --> 07:03.774
Okay, wait.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.012
No, it's fine, come on.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.658
Sit. Um...

07:22.827 --> 07:24.261
Do you, uh,
you want a cup of coffee?

07:24.295 --> 07:25.863
I have instant.

07:26.831 --> 07:27.665
Sure, why not?

07:29.033 --> 07:30.001
I'm Riad.

07:30.735 --> 07:31.569
Taylor.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.073
You, uh, expecting a storm?

07:42.313 --> 07:44.582
Wow, there really is
nothing out here, is there?

07:45.349 --> 07:47.151
- It's Oregon.
- Sure is.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.955
Hey, you don't know
anything about cars, do you?

07:50.988 --> 07:53.724
- Not really.
- Shit, that sucks.

07:56.293 --> 07:57.628
Why don't you try your phone?

07:58.729 --> 07:59.529
Yeah.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.737
No service, no charger, no cell.

08:08.606 --> 08:09.140
You got a landline?

08:10.608 --> 08:12.043
Shit, this really is my day.

08:14.178 --> 08:15.146
So what do you do?

08:16.881 --> 08:19.050
- What's it to you?
- Just making conversation.

08:25.356 --> 08:27.825
Anyone else live around these parts?
Then I can get out of your hair.

08:28.859 --> 08:29.894
Just me.

08:30.828 --> 08:32.129
Well, if you have an hour,
maybe you can,

08:32.163 --> 08:33.964
uh, drive me into town?

08:33.998 --> 08:34.999
I could pay you.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.836
- I don't need your money.
- Any other suggestions?

08:41.304 --> 08:42.972
I'll be picking up mail
in town this afternoon.

08:43.006 --> 08:44.608
I'll drive you in.
Someone can help you there.

08:45.810 --> 08:47.178
- This afternoon?
- Two hours.

08:47.812 --> 08:48.946
Can't leave any earlier.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.248
Okay.

08:52.316 --> 08:54.952
Well, thank you, and sorry
for the inconvenience.

08:54.985 --> 08:56.320
Yeah, it's bad timing.

08:56.353 --> 08:57.154
Yeah.

08:59.390 --> 09:00.724
That looks disgusting.

09:04.361 --> 09:05.930
Simple never goes bad.

09:11.669 --> 09:13.070
You got TV?

09:22.379 --> 09:23.180
Great.

09:25.316 --> 09:26.851
Or you could continue
with your birding.

09:28.419 --> 09:30.087
What are you out
here looking for?

09:30.121 --> 09:31.255
Pretty birds.

09:31.288 --> 09:32.256
Maybe a pine grosbeak?

09:33.958 --> 09:34.992
Yeah, I know those.

09:35.893 --> 09:37.128
They have blue feathers,
yellow beak.

09:39.130 --> 09:40.965
Not even close. They have...

09:42.766 --> 09:45.136
red and orange
feathers on the head

09:45.703 --> 09:46.904
and a black beak.

09:47.805 --> 09:48.639
Like this.

09:51.442 --> 09:52.409
Yeah, I've seen those.

09:53.978 --> 09:55.412
What about a kingbird?

09:55.446 --> 09:57.014
No Western kingbirds
in these parts.

09:58.315 --> 09:59.250
Yeah, I like birds.

10:00.451 --> 10:02.119
They're interesting, you know.

10:02.153 --> 10:04.155
I see so many out here.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.756
Much more predictable
than people.

10:08.392 --> 10:13.130
My favorite is, um, I just
read about it, uh, a killbird,

10:13.164 --> 10:16.033
kill something or other.

10:16.066 --> 10:19.103
It, uh, it uses
a wounded wing act

10:19.136 --> 10:20.938
to distract predators
from its nest.

10:20.971 --> 10:22.907
It plods along
the ground holding its wing,

10:22.940 --> 10:24.909
a bird in distress,
shrieking in pain.

10:27.978 --> 10:29.280
Predators go in for
an easy kill,

10:29.313 --> 10:31.248
but before it knows what's what,

10:31.282 --> 10:33.450
killbird's suddenly
all better and flies away.

10:34.952 --> 10:35.753
Tricky.

10:37.521 --> 10:39.790
It's called a killdeer, I think.

10:41.091 --> 10:41.959
Killdeer?

10:43.327 --> 10:44.762
Strange name for a bird.

10:45.796 --> 10:46.397
Yeah.

10:47.932 --> 10:49.266
Cuckoos are my fave.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.935
They're the worst though.

10:50.968 --> 10:52.736
Brooding parasites
that lay their eggs

10:52.770 --> 10:55.873
in another bird's nest,
usually a poor magpie,

10:55.906 --> 10:57.875
then they get that bird
to raise its young.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.977
Some don't even know it
until it's too late,

11:00.544 --> 11:03.013
but if the mama bird's smart,

11:03.047 --> 11:05.049
she'll toss the eggs
out of the nest,

11:05.082 --> 11:08.219
and then the cuckoo goes on
attack, destroys the nest,

11:08.252 --> 11:11.422
the eggs, everything,
until the poor little magpie

11:11.455 --> 11:15.025
just gives up and raises
its cuckoo bastards.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.728
It's kind of like a bird
that works for the mob.

11:21.298 --> 11:23.867
You know your birds.

11:27.905 --> 11:28.806
Stay here.

12:27.264 --> 12:28.600
Anything interesting?

12:28.633 --> 12:30.234
No.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.269
Not really.

13:01.633 --> 13:03.200
So, birding,
this like a real job?

13:04.935 --> 13:06.870
Yeah, sort of. It's part-time.

13:06.904 --> 13:08.405
You sell your pictures?

13:09.139 --> 13:11.108
Oh, we try to.
It's mostly a hobby.

13:11.141 --> 13:13.010
- What else do you do?
- Temp work.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.978
- Temp?
- Yeah, you know, secretary,

13:15.012 --> 13:17.649
- domestic services, things like that.
- Hmm.

13:17.682 --> 13:19.216
What happens when
you quit school, but hey,

13:19.249 --> 13:21.952
my husband makes enough,
so whatever.

13:21.985 --> 13:25.222
I just figure I got to do
something or I'll lose my mind.

13:25.255 --> 13:27.024
Why don't you go back to school?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.093
You're getting really
personal here.

13:29.126 --> 13:30.894
Just want to make sure
you're not a crazy person.

13:30.928 --> 13:32.229
Is that why you're
asking all the questions?

13:32.262 --> 13:33.397
It's not normal to be out here.

13:33.430 --> 13:34.331
Well, it's not normal to be

13:34.365 --> 13:35.332
living out here.

13:35.966 --> 13:37.301
I got tired of the big city.

13:38.235 --> 13:41.171
I was studying psychology,
but I'm no psychiatrist,

13:41.205 --> 13:43.207
and it took me too long
to figure that out.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.075
My husband Doug is though.

13:45.610 --> 13:48.112
I was probably infatuated
with him.

13:48.145 --> 13:50.914
You know, he's really good at
listening to other people's problems

13:50.948 --> 13:53.350
and ignoring everything else
in his life, including me.

13:54.051 --> 13:55.553
I guess I'm just something
else though.

13:55.587 --> 13:56.987
Like?

13:57.020 --> 14:00.224
Like, I'm creative.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.159
You know? What do you do?

14:04.228 --> 14:05.229
I do nothing.

14:06.196 --> 14:07.665
Well, you're a little
young to be retired.

14:07.699 --> 14:09.400
- Taking a vacation.
- From what?

14:09.433 --> 14:10.234
Doesn't matter.

14:13.337 --> 14:14.138
Okay.

14:15.573 --> 14:19.410
Well hey, look,
um, my car isn't far.

14:19.443 --> 14:22.946
Maybe you've got jumper cables.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.282
- Uh...
- You got to have those, right?

14:25.315 --> 14:26.684
No, I already told you.

14:26.718 --> 14:28.452
That you're not
a mechanic, I know.

14:28.485 --> 14:30.454
I just thought guys
would be good with their

14:30.487 --> 14:32.156
- cars and tools and stuff.
- Not me.

14:36.026 --> 14:36.927
Okay.

14:38.128 --> 14:38.929
Okay.

14:41.031 --> 14:42.499
I read birders make good spies.

14:46.236 --> 14:47.438
Are you saying I should
become a spy?

14:48.706 --> 14:49.973
Just something I read.

14:53.043 --> 14:54.445
Here, come on, I'll show you.

14:59.149 --> 15:02.554
Sorge, Duchesne, Hari,
they're all birders,

15:02.587 --> 15:03.688
to one degree or another.

15:05.456 --> 15:07.057
Hmm. Never heard of them.

15:07.090 --> 15:08.726
Yeah, spies fascinate me.

15:10.060 --> 15:12.564
Sorge, he infiltrated
Japan in World War Two,

15:12.597 --> 15:14.097
posing as a journalist.

15:14.131 --> 15:16.133
He uncovered that Japan
had no intention

15:16.166 --> 15:18.101
of invading the USSR.

15:18.135 --> 15:20.404
Without that intel,
it's entirely possible

15:20.437 --> 15:22.206
Germany would've taken
the Russians.

15:23.240 --> 15:27.010
Had they beat the Russians,
Germany would've taken the war.

15:28.245 --> 15:31.048
- Huh.
- He was eventually captured and hanged.

15:35.052 --> 15:36.186
You don't seem to care.

15:37.488 --> 15:38.322
World War Two.

15:41.559 --> 15:43.193
History's rich with
hidden stories.

15:43.628 --> 15:46.396
- It sure seems that way.
- But none beat the women

15:46.430 --> 15:48.465
when it comes
to the game of espionage.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.670
I didn't know that women
were spies or the best.

15:52.704 --> 15:54.304
You learn something
new every day.

15:54.338 --> 15:55.807
Like, to this day
we're not really sure

15:55.840 --> 15:57.341
which side Mata Hari was on.

15:59.611 --> 16:02.747
- Oh, come on, you know.
- Sorry, I...

16:02.780 --> 16:05.215
One of the, the most infamous
spies of World War One.

16:06.551 --> 16:07.685
I know the Iraq War.

16:09.854 --> 16:12.089
That's just not a,
it's not a war.

16:12.590 --> 16:15.058
Okay, well, don't tell my cousin
that, 'cause he did two tours.

16:15.092 --> 16:17.461
It was barely a conflict,
never mind a war.

16:17.494 --> 16:19.429
Okay, it wasn't a war.

16:26.771 --> 16:28.238
Was she German?

16:30.340 --> 16:31.809
- Who?
- Mata Hari.

16:33.878 --> 16:34.679
Dutch.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.583
She, she fell in love
with a French officer

16:38.616 --> 16:40.417
who needed an eye operation

16:40.450 --> 16:44.121
and went undercover as
a French spy to pay for it.

16:44.154 --> 16:46.724
Of course, the officer
hooks up with another girl,

16:46.758 --> 16:49.694
so she decides to make
a life of spying.

16:49.727 --> 16:51.763
- Hmm.
- She pretends to be a double agent to the Germans,

16:51.796 --> 16:53.463
but actually works
for the French.

16:53.497 --> 16:56.166
In the end no one really
knew who she was working for,

16:56.199 --> 16:58.770
so they, uh, they executed her.

16:59.904 --> 17:00.838
Shit.

17:02.239 --> 17:03.140
Sucks to be her.

17:04.441 --> 17:05.474
Yeah, I guess it does.

17:08.211 --> 17:09.747
So why would I want
to be a spy then?

17:09.781 --> 17:10.848
I mean, I'd rather
stick to birds.

17:10.882 --> 17:12.415
Real spies get captured,

17:12.449 --> 17:14.551
poisoned, tortured, executed.

17:15.484 --> 17:17.722
Screw that, man.
I'd rather be alive.

17:18.656 --> 17:20.558
- That right?
- Well, yeah.

17:20.592 --> 17:22.224
Death kind of sucks.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.094
I guess it does.

17:27.898 --> 17:29.266
Um...

17:30.233 --> 17:32.202
So is that what
you're doing up here?

17:34.806 --> 17:36.106
Spying?

17:37.474 --> 17:38.676
What would make you say that?

17:39.844 --> 17:41.713
I don't know, you just seem
to know a lot about spies.

17:41.746 --> 17:43.715
- Maybe you're spying.
- On what?

17:43.748 --> 17:46.350
I don't know.
Whatever's out here, the bears?

17:46.383 --> 17:47.752
No bears out here.

17:47.785 --> 17:49.921
Like I said,
I'm taking a vacation.

17:49.954 --> 17:52.624
This is the perfect place for that.
No one to bother you up here.

17:52.657 --> 17:54.726
Well, except for
the occasional birder.

17:56.794 --> 17:57.829
Sorry.

17:58.663 --> 17:59.697
Shit happens.

17:59.731 --> 18:00.698
Sure does.

18:03.367 --> 18:07.504
So, did she get a stamp
for all her troubles?

18:09.206 --> 18:10.140
Mata Hari? Uh...

18:11.341 --> 18:12.577
no.

18:14.078 --> 18:18.482
You know that the post office is
super weird with their stamps, right?

18:18.515 --> 18:20.585
It'd be pretty weird
for a spy to get one.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.921
Birds get stamps.

18:23.955 --> 18:26.323
Yeah, and they don't even
have to die for their country.

18:26.356 --> 18:30.193
- Well, neither do spies.
- What do spies die for then?

18:30.227 --> 18:31.395
Their ego.

18:31.796 --> 18:34.464
That is funny.

18:34.498 --> 18:36.734
Can you imagine
a narcissistic spy,

18:36.768 --> 18:38.903
self-involved guy looking
at himself in the mirror

18:38.936 --> 18:41.371
and getting stabbed
in the back?

18:43.007 --> 18:45.242
Ego and money,
it's never about patriotism.

18:46.844 --> 18:48.613
You sure know
your shit about this.

18:48.646 --> 18:49.747
Why do you care?

18:50.782 --> 18:53.551
Big business and the CIA
control the government,

18:53.584 --> 18:56.954
and so long as they do, we have
no real government, just debt.

18:56.988 --> 18:58.488
A whole lot of debt.

18:58.522 --> 18:59.489
Yeah, sure do.

18:59.523 --> 19:00.792
I mean, I have debt.

19:00.825 --> 19:02.560
Maybe I can just call up the CIA

19:02.593 --> 19:03.594
and have them wire me
some money,

19:03.628 --> 19:04.929
because they're in control.

19:07.297 --> 19:08.231
You think I'm nuts?

19:08.265 --> 19:08.933
No.

19:10.902 --> 19:11.669
Be honest.

19:12.704 --> 19:14.471
Look, is there a lot

19:14.504 --> 19:15.773
of fucked up shit going
on in the world?

19:15.807 --> 19:16.974
Hell yes.

19:17.008 --> 19:18.576
And I'm not a computer hacker.

19:18.609 --> 19:20.410
I don't know how to download

19:20.444 --> 19:22.747
or any of that kind of stuff.

19:23.614 --> 19:26.551
But they've got millions of dollars.
They've got lawyers, courts.

19:26.584 --> 19:29.687
They can bribe whoever
they want, the whole shebang.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.389
And my husband is totally into
this shit, but frankly,

19:32.422 --> 19:33.523
I'll just stick to birds.

19:34.458 --> 19:35.793
You're making fun of me.

19:36.694 --> 19:39.897
I'm just playing. I mean,
what are you going to do?

19:39.931 --> 19:41.899
Are you going to tear it all down
from your cabin in the woods here?

19:41.933 --> 19:43.366
All it takes is one person.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.369
For what?

19:46.403 --> 19:47.304
Change.

19:49.306 --> 19:50.908
Sure does.

19:50.942 --> 19:53.611
Car breaks down
and your whole day changes.

19:58.716 --> 20:00.283
Am I keeping you from something?

20:02.620 --> 20:04.387
No, nothing that can't wait.

20:05.757 --> 20:07.592
- Oh, shit.
- Are you expecting someone?

20:08.092 --> 20:09.259
What do you think?

20:26.443 --> 20:27.511
Feeling better?

20:27.544 --> 20:28.646
Must've been a bird.

20:30.782 --> 20:32.482
Missed opportunity.

20:32.516 --> 20:33.885
Could've been a good one.

20:35.153 --> 20:37.354
You have alarms on your
property, it's a bit intense, no?

20:37.387 --> 20:38.990
- Keep out the bad guys.
- Here?

20:41.424 --> 20:43.594
- What's the problem?
- No problem. I just figure

20:43.628 --> 20:45.963
if I was a burglar I wouldn't
want to come all the way out here.

20:46.597 --> 20:47.598
All it takes is one crazy.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.366
Yeah, no kidding.

21:01.712 --> 21:02.914
What are you writing down?

21:02.947 --> 21:04.048
Alarm logs.

21:04.682 --> 21:06.516
- What's your name?
- Taylor.

21:06.551 --> 21:07.852
- Taylor what?
- Crane.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.888
- Birthday?
- November 9th.

21:14.091 --> 21:17.128
You know, this is some fucked up shit. Are
you going to steal my identity or something?

21:17.161 --> 21:18.863
I just like to know
who I'm dealing with.

21:19.429 --> 21:20.965
You really are nuts.
Well, at least do my horoscope,

21:20.998 --> 21:23.400
- give me my money's worth.
- Yeah, astrology's a lie.

21:23.433 --> 21:25.468
The earth has
a wobble along its axis

21:25.502 --> 21:27.572
that changed the elliptical
equator over the last 3,000 years.

21:27.605 --> 21:30.473
Now every Cancer's a Gemini,
every Gemini's a Taurus.

21:30.507 --> 21:33.578
Wow. You know, I totally am
into this mystical stuff,

21:33.611 --> 21:35.445
you know, tarot cards.

21:35.478 --> 21:37.949
In theory, palm reading is
considered much more accurate.

21:37.982 --> 21:40.084
The palm is a fossilized record
of a person's development.

21:43.621 --> 21:44.555
Do it.

21:47.158 --> 21:47.925
I'd rather not.

21:49.694 --> 21:50.527
Come on.

21:52.964 --> 21:53.731
What do you see?

22:01.205 --> 22:02.907
You're strong-willed, vital.

22:03.774 --> 22:05.408
What else do you see?
I love this shit.

22:05.442 --> 22:06.611
What do you want to know?

22:07.044 --> 22:09.614
Um, am I going to have kids?

22:11.215 --> 22:15.052
Probably not. Your love line indicates
you're aloof and prone to affairs.

22:15.086 --> 22:16.419
Affairs?

22:17.121 --> 22:18.656
So am I going to stay
with my husband?

22:20.057 --> 22:20.858
Unlikely.

22:24.028 --> 22:26.797
So, have you ever been wrong?

22:26.831 --> 22:29.166
Sure, all the time.
It's complete bullshit most of the time.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.701
So I could have kids?

22:31.903 --> 22:34.138
- Yeah.
- And I could live out the days with my husband?

22:35.039 --> 22:35.840
Mm-hmm.

22:37.241 --> 22:39.911
Why bother
if it's just lies?

22:41.212 --> 22:42.613
Exactly.

22:43.714 --> 22:45.482
Huh. Your wife?

22:46.250 --> 22:47.184
Dog.

22:47.952 --> 22:49.120
Do you keep him upstairs?

22:51.022 --> 22:53.557
- Why not?
- I mean, wouldn't he want to be down here

22:53.591 --> 22:55.626
- or out in the yard?
- He's a lazy dog.

22:55.660 --> 22:56.727
He usually sleeps.

22:56.761 --> 22:57.795
He likes the quiet.

22:59.664 --> 23:00.564
He told you that?

23:01.933 --> 23:02.800
What's it to you?

23:05.803 --> 23:08.906
I just know that my dog would go crazy,
loves running around all over the place.

23:08.940 --> 23:11.474
And I know I wouldn't want to
be cooped up like that.

23:11.508 --> 23:12.910
He has water, food.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.782
You're not thinking about reporting
me to some animal shelter?

23:17.815 --> 23:20.017
- No, no, no, it's fine.
- I wouldn't want that.

23:21.085 --> 23:22.987
- None of my business.
- That's right. It's just, uh,

23:23.020 --> 23:24.722
it's none of your business,

23:24.755 --> 23:27.158
but you do ask
a lot of questions.

23:28.759 --> 23:30.194
Yeah, well I'm just
made that way.

23:30.227 --> 23:32.063
My husband complains
about it all the time,

23:32.096 --> 23:33.931
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

23:33.965 --> 23:35.666
Your husband, the, the lawyer?

23:35.700 --> 23:37.500
- Psychiatrist.
- Right.

23:40.071 --> 23:41.138
What was his name?

23:41.872 --> 23:43.540
And you think I ask
a lot of questions?

23:45.676 --> 23:46.476
Dave.

23:47.111 --> 23:48.079
What? Dave what?

23:48.879 --> 23:50.014
Ellis.

23:54.618 --> 23:56.620
- When was he born?
- This is weird.

23:57.321 --> 23:58.521
Just tell me.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.226
- December 8th, why?
- Year?

24:03.794 --> 24:04.862
Are you okay?

24:04.895 --> 24:06.697
- What year?
- '81.

24:08.733 --> 24:11.202
- Anniversary?
- Are you serious?

24:11.235 --> 24:13.237
- Do you want me to drive you into town?
- Okay, fine,

24:13.270 --> 24:14.972
if that's how
we're going to play it.

24:15.006 --> 24:16.741
Married or first day we met?

24:16.774 --> 24:17.842
Both.

24:18.576 --> 24:20.044
May 8th, September 15th.

24:20.644 --> 24:22.913
- Married in May?
- September.

24:23.881 --> 24:25.548
I know, who gets married
in September, right?

24:25.583 --> 24:28.586
But, hey, we did,
'cause you know, fuck it.

24:29.787 --> 24:31.589
- Fuck it.
- It was also cheaper.

24:36.293 --> 24:37.194
Check that window, will you?

24:44.168 --> 24:45.636
He shouldn't be here.
I pick up my mail.

24:46.604 --> 24:47.204
Wait here.

25:48.766 --> 25:49.967
Holy shit.

25:51.368 --> 25:52.770
Oh, fuck.

26:34.712 --> 26:35.646
Hey.

26:37.781 --> 26:38.949
What are you doing?

26:38.983 --> 26:40.851
I was just looking
for the bathroom.

26:42.119 --> 26:42.920
Hmm.

26:44.121 --> 26:45.222
Yeah, it's not in there.

26:46.257 --> 26:48.726
I figured. My mistake.
I just really need to go.

26:48.759 --> 26:49.693
It's outside.

26:50.728 --> 26:51.328
Okay.

26:55.733 --> 26:57.701
I didn't recognize
the delivery man.

26:57.735 --> 26:58.769
A lot of changes today.

27:00.171 --> 27:01.105
What's in the box?

27:03.007 --> 27:04.008
Question of the day.

27:13.050 --> 27:14.084
Western meadowlark.

27:18.022 --> 27:19.857
Actually, wild birds
are far less fascinating

27:19.890 --> 27:21.192
than domesticated birds.

27:21.225 --> 27:22.359
How so?

27:22.927 --> 27:24.395
Well, um, well, take a chicken.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.933
A dumb animal by any standard.

27:29.833 --> 27:32.937
- I suppose.
- But, uh, chickens have a pecking order,

27:32.970 --> 27:35.206
a literal pecking order.

27:35.906 --> 27:38.475
And if a, if a chicken
doesn't respect the hierarchy,

27:38.509 --> 27:42.079
a higher status chicken
will peck at it, peck and peck,

27:42.112 --> 27:44.281
tearing skin and drawing blood.

27:45.249 --> 27:47.151
Under duress,
other chickens join in,

27:47.785 --> 27:49.753
pecking the disrespectful
bird to death.

27:54.792 --> 27:56.760
The point is, it's beneficial
to know your place.

28:42.339 --> 28:43.140
Hello?

29:14.371 --> 29:15.139
Who are you?

29:16.641 --> 29:18.409
- What?
- You heard me.

29:20.911 --> 29:21.845
Who are you?

29:23.914 --> 29:25.349
Why are you doing this?

29:25.382 --> 29:27.217
Who are you?

29:27.251 --> 29:30.854
Please, please
don't hurt me, please.

29:30.888 --> 29:33.057
- Stop with the games.
- I don't understand.

29:33.090 --> 29:35.593
- Are you a spook?
- Like for the government?

29:35.627 --> 29:38.095
- Stop!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

29:39.296 --> 29:40.397
What's in the box?

29:41.165 --> 29:42.533
You sent it. What's inside?

29:42.567 --> 29:44.068
I didn't send anything.
I didn't know I was

29:44.101 --> 29:45.969
- going to be here!
- Lies!

29:46.003 --> 29:48.939
Please. I didn't
see anything, okay?

29:48.972 --> 29:50.608
Please don't hurt me.

29:50.642 --> 29:52.009
I won't tell anyone anything.

29:52.042 --> 29:53.844
Anything about what?

29:55.446 --> 29:58.315
I don't know, I don't know. I just...
My car broke down and I just needed help.

29:58.349 --> 30:00.284
Please, I don't want
to be here anymore.

30:01.251 --> 30:04.021
- Just quit the act.
- I don't understand.

30:05.956 --> 30:08.158
- How'd you find me, huh?
- I don't even know who you are.

30:08.192 --> 30:09.893
- Satellite? Facial recognition?
- I don't know what...

30:09.927 --> 30:10.928
- Is that shit even real?
- How did you track me?

30:10.961 --> 30:12.262
I don't know.

30:12.296 --> 30:13.565
- This is not going to end well!
- Please!

30:13.598 --> 30:15.265
I'm not who you think I am!

30:15.299 --> 30:17.067
No, please!

30:22.439 --> 30:23.440
Open it.

30:25.275 --> 30:26.210
Now!

30:51.535 --> 30:52.903
It's a geometry set.

30:54.104 --> 30:54.972
What?

31:09.153 --> 31:10.053
What the fuck?

31:16.761 --> 31:18.630
This your way of poking
my nose in it?

31:18.663 --> 31:20.665
- No.
- Who sent you?

31:20.698 --> 31:22.667
It's just a coincidence, okay?

31:22.700 --> 31:24.535
It's just bad fucking timing.

31:24.569 --> 31:27.271
- Compass and a T-square?
- Your intel is bad.

31:28.005 --> 31:31.008
Masons were involved at the start,
but it's gone way beyond that now!

31:31.041 --> 31:33.377
- My husband knows where I am.
- What, your psychiatrist husband

31:33.410 --> 31:36.180
who barely has time for you? He knows
you're birding in the middle of nowhere?

31:36.213 --> 31:38.015
- Liar!
- No, it's for a magazine!

31:38.048 --> 31:40.685
It was a small commission.
It just helped me relax.

31:41.318 --> 31:43.187
I should've tried like CBD

31:43.220 --> 31:45.989
or fucking sleeping pills
or meditation!

31:46.023 --> 31:47.991
You're playing with me.
You're fucking with my head.

31:48.025 --> 31:50.595
No, no, I'm not playing with
you. Please just let me go.

31:52.730 --> 31:53.530
Please.

31:57.034 --> 31:58.302
Tell me again about
your husband.

31:58.335 --> 31:59.503
What does he think of you?

32:00.437 --> 32:03.040
He thinks I'm always
changing my mind,

32:03.073 --> 32:05.175
I can't finish anything
that I started,

32:06.043 --> 32:07.645
that he would rather
have me out of the house

32:07.679 --> 32:11.248
doing shit like this,
like photographing birds,

32:11.281 --> 32:12.382
than being there with him.

32:14.084 --> 32:15.352
Have you ever been with anyone

32:15.385 --> 32:17.755
who doesn't even
acknowledge your existence?

32:20.290 --> 32:21.425
You love him?

32:22.226 --> 32:23.160
Why do you care?

32:25.429 --> 32:26.497
Yeah.

32:27.164 --> 32:30.133
Yeah, I love him,
and he loves his work.

32:34.304 --> 32:35.239
Do you have kids?

32:37.341 --> 32:38.375
What's the problem?

32:40.678 --> 32:42.045
Are you going to let me go?

32:42.079 --> 32:43.280
Haven't decided yet.

32:47.518 --> 32:48.686
Someone must love you.

32:49.921 --> 32:52.322
Are you married? Would they want
you doing this kind of shit?

32:52.356 --> 32:55.158
- Don't ask me questions!
- You think I'm a threat?

32:55.192 --> 32:57.629
- Me?
- You're secret police, NSA, CIA, FBI!

32:57.662 --> 32:59.631
You're fucking nuts, man!

32:59.664 --> 33:01.766
And why would those people give
a shit about what you're doing

33:01.799 --> 33:03.801
out in the middle of
bumble-fuck nowhere?

33:03.835 --> 33:05.335
Because of what I took.

33:06.771 --> 33:07.572
Oh, my god.

33:09.339 --> 33:10.474
That's a bomb.

33:11.241 --> 33:12.543
That's what
you're fucking doing.

33:12.577 --> 33:14.712
It's not what you think.
I'm not a psycho.

33:14.746 --> 33:17.815
No, no, no, you're one of
those fucking converts.

33:17.849 --> 33:19.651
You're fucking ISIS!

33:20.284 --> 33:22.554
Holy shit. You're going
to fucking videotape me

33:22.587 --> 33:24.488
and then cut off
my fucking head!

33:24.521 --> 33:26.323
Don't be so dramatic.

33:26.356 --> 33:28.191
What would be the point
in killing you?

33:28.793 --> 33:30.427
We're on the same page then.

33:40.537 --> 33:42.172
You asked about the device.
That was smart.

33:44.141 --> 33:45.342
What? Why?

33:46.510 --> 33:47.679
Because it's not
why you're here.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.625
What do you know about Catalyst?

34:01.224 --> 34:03.226
It sounds like a fucking
video game!

34:05.395 --> 34:06.598
Fuck you!

34:12.335 --> 34:13.503
You know.

34:13.871 --> 34:16.239
- You saw the files.
- I didn't see anything.

34:16.273 --> 34:18.576
It just looked like
a bunch of encoding shit

34:18.610 --> 34:20.777
and fucking newspaper
clippings on your wall.

34:21.846 --> 34:22.614
You're good.

34:24.281 --> 34:24.882
You're real good.

34:26.717 --> 34:28.452
They must know
I'm getting close, huh?

34:29.219 --> 34:30.722
Only a few missing pieces.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.625
Communication channels,
the organizations involved,

34:33.658 --> 34:35.860
and the one thing I could never figure
out, what happened to the passengers?

34:35.893 --> 34:37.895
- What passengers?
- What did you do with them?

34:37.929 --> 34:39.697
I didn't do anything to anybody.

34:39.731 --> 34:41.766
Three planes traveling
at a low altitude,

34:41.799 --> 34:44.702
hitting the towers,
defying every law of physics,

34:44.735 --> 34:47.772
leaving a roadrunner imprint and
then melting the fucking buildings

34:47.804 --> 34:50.708
in not one but three
perfect demolitions?

34:50.742 --> 34:54.311
All this allegedly done in
almost perfect synchronicity

34:54.344 --> 34:56.413
by guys who had two
months of flying lessons.

34:56.981 --> 34:59.751
Huh? It was
a coordinated effort,

34:59.784 --> 35:02.252
a terrorist plot that
was given a little push.

35:02.285 --> 35:04.388
It was never about the Iraq War.

35:04.421 --> 35:06.323
Catalyst could only
be set in motion

35:06.356 --> 35:08.926
once everyone was scared
out of their fucking minds.

35:09.627 --> 35:12.362
Edward Snowden, he was aware of the
surveillance, but he didn't have access

35:12.396 --> 35:14.431
to the redacted files
prior to Prism.

35:14.464 --> 35:16.701
Once the towers came down,
so did privacy.

35:16.734 --> 35:18.803
X-Keyscore compromised emails.

35:18.836 --> 35:20.605
Fascia compromised
location data.

35:20.638 --> 35:22.874
Dishfire compromised
text messages.

35:22.907 --> 35:25.710
A few Freemasons responsible
who infiltrated the NSA

35:25.743 --> 35:27.645
and helped kickstart
the whole damn thing.

35:27.679 --> 35:30.547
Do you fucking watch <i>Loose</i>
<i>Change</i> on repeat or something?

35:31.348 --> 35:32.984
- Is that what this is?
- You're good.

35:33.017 --> 35:34.518
Fucking let me go.

35:35.019 --> 35:38.589
I can't believe this
is happening.

35:38.623 --> 35:41.458
If you know anything,
you'd know I was a frog man.

35:41.491 --> 35:43.527
I don't know anything about you.

35:43.561 --> 35:45.295
You know, I was
dishonorably discharged

35:46.296 --> 35:47.297
and then recruited.

35:49.967 --> 35:51.468
I'm sorry.

35:51.836 --> 35:53.370
I don't keep up with the news.

35:55.305 --> 35:56.306
It was a national story.

35:59.276 --> 36:01.813
A few powerful white men
decided to scapegoat a brown guy

36:01.846 --> 36:04.314
for a military fuck-up,
and now my brother's in jail.

36:06.551 --> 36:07.685
I am sorry.

36:07.719 --> 36:08.853
- Yeah.
- That's horrible.

36:08.886 --> 36:09.954
I don't need your
false sympathy.

36:11.455 --> 36:12.857
You probably signed the order.

36:13.624 --> 36:17.394
- What order?
- You'll break, like the other spook.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.664
If you're lying,
I'll know soon enough.

36:20.330 --> 36:22.633
Stay here, I'll be back.

36:22.667 --> 36:25.002
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you going?

36:25.036 --> 36:26.671
Wait, don't fucking
leave me here!

36:26.704 --> 36:28.606
I'm not a fucking agent!

36:29.841 --> 36:31.776
Fuck! Fuck!

38:09.807 --> 38:11.508
Oh, yes.

38:21.185 --> 38:22.119
Oh, shit.

39:51.275 --> 39:52.610
Holy shit.

39:57.114 --> 39:58.683
- You're not Riad.
- Yeah, no shit.

39:58.716 --> 39:59.917
Who the fuck are you?

40:01.118 --> 40:04.822
Hey, look, we have to get
the hell out of here right now.

40:04.855 --> 40:06.657
Okay, where is the key to this thing?
How do you get out of here?

40:06.691 --> 40:07.524
No, no, no, no.

40:08.259 --> 40:10.027
It's not safe out there.

40:10.995 --> 40:12.196
And it's safe in here?

40:12.797 --> 40:14.732
Like, why are you
making so much noise?

40:15.800 --> 40:16.867
I'm hungry.

40:19.536 --> 40:20.171
Shh.

40:21.739 --> 40:23.174
They want to kill me.

40:23.207 --> 40:25.910
I go out there,
I have to disappear.

40:26.543 --> 40:28.112
Why would anyone want
to kill you, huh?

40:30.014 --> 40:31.582
You know.

41:48.025 --> 41:51.095
No, no! Please!

41:53.297 --> 41:55.299
It's dead. It's dead.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.268
No!

41:57.301 --> 41:59.637
No, no, no, no, no!

42:00.871 --> 42:01.872
No!

42:02.773 --> 42:06.777
No! No!

42:09.146 --> 42:10.014
No!

42:13.417 --> 42:14.285
Like dÃ©jÃ  vu.

42:15.119 --> 42:16.353
I had to take you with me.

42:17.421 --> 42:18.856
What did you inject me with?

42:21.125 --> 42:23.027
A short-acting barbiturate.

42:23.060 --> 42:24.261
Better than a polygraph.

42:24.962 --> 42:26.664
Got a connection in town.

42:26.697 --> 42:28.966
Maybe that's the same guy
that sent you the package.

42:31.102 --> 42:32.937
It broke the other spook.

42:32.970 --> 42:34.405
Sang like a bird.

42:34.438 --> 42:36.040
You mean the guy upstairs?

42:37.074 --> 42:38.175
That guy's no spy.

42:39.243 --> 42:40.744
What did you do to him?

42:41.946 --> 42:43.614
What I'm going to do to you
until you tell me the truth.

42:45.116 --> 42:46.150
Are you going to kill me?

42:48.719 --> 42:49.687
I haven't decided yet.

42:52.189 --> 42:53.224
Fuck!

42:53.891 --> 42:55.192
Oh, I'm going to be sick.

42:56.460 --> 42:57.228
Who are you?

42:58.329 --> 43:00.231
Fuck you. I already told you.

43:01.031 --> 43:01.899
Who are you?

43:04.001 --> 43:05.636
You are very serious.

43:06.303 --> 43:08.405
There's so many me's, I don't
even know where to start.

43:08.439 --> 43:10.007
Start with your name.

43:11.041 --> 43:12.209
- Taylor.
- Taylor what?

43:12.243 --> 43:13.711
Taylor Crane.

43:13.744 --> 43:15.312
I'm 31, I'm a Scorpio,

43:15.346 --> 43:17.114
and I'm soon to be single
if my husband

43:17.148 --> 43:18.849
doesn't get his shit together.

43:19.450 --> 43:22.052
Describe the circumstances
that led to you being here.

43:22.086 --> 43:23.787
- This is a strange way to talk.
- Do it.

43:26.390 --> 43:30.261
Well, this wild birdy told me to
come up here and say cheese.

43:30.294 --> 43:32.296
It's not a joke.
How'd you end up at this cabin?

43:32.329 --> 43:33.364
I already told you.

43:33.397 --> 43:33.964
Tell me again.

43:35.766 --> 43:37.268
Well, while I was birding,

43:37.301 --> 43:39.837
my car broke down in
the middle of fucking nowhere,

43:39.870 --> 43:41.772
'cause that's what
cars do, right? Murphy's law.

43:41.805 --> 43:43.908
I mean,
who the fuck is Murphy anyway?

43:44.341 --> 43:46.010
Focus.

43:46.043 --> 43:47.178
I, I bet you know who he is,

43:47.211 --> 43:48.379
and you just don't
want to tell me.

43:52.049 --> 43:54.285
Murphy's Law originated
with an aerospace engineer.

43:54.318 --> 43:55.386
His name was Edward Murphy.

43:55.419 --> 43:57.054
Your car stalled.

43:57.087 --> 43:58.422
How did you end up
in these parts?

44:00.124 --> 44:01.859
I was just bored.

44:01.892 --> 44:04.161
I mean, it was either
taking up birding

44:04.195 --> 44:05.763
or taking up a lover.

44:05.796 --> 44:08.232
Maybe I should be
taking up both.

44:08.265 --> 44:10.234
- So you're just killing time?
- Yeah, you know.

44:10.267 --> 44:13.804
Soul-searching,
reading self-help books,

44:13.837 --> 44:17.374
all that kind of stuff.
I mean, hey, look what good it's done me.

44:17.408 --> 44:21.011
I'm up here in a cabin
with a fucking Unabomber.

44:21.979 --> 44:24.215
- There's more to that story.
- Oh, I'm sure there is, yeah.

44:24.248 --> 44:26.183
He had bad parents, boo-hoo,

44:26.217 --> 44:28.252
but that doesn't give you
a reason to kill people.

44:28.285 --> 44:30.421
Ted Kaczynski was
a brilliant student

44:30.454 --> 44:32.489
until the CIA got their
hands on him at Harvard.

44:32.523 --> 44:33.958
You must know something
about that.

44:33.991 --> 44:35.759
Actually, you know what?
I don't.

44:35.793 --> 44:37.127
Why don't you invite
your friend Ted up here

44:37.161 --> 44:38.295
and then he can
tell me all about it.

44:40.531 --> 44:44.835
They subjected him to a series of
degrading and humiliating experiments,

44:44.868 --> 44:48.372
destroyed him, tried to mind
control a brilliant student.

44:49.173 --> 44:52.443
The teacher would humiliate him in class
until he couldn't function anymore.

44:52.476 --> 44:54.812
He disappeared. Then he started
killing off the Feds

44:54.845 --> 44:56.914
and spooks in charge of
the MK Ultra experiments.

44:56.947 --> 44:59.083
You never hear about how
Harvard and the CIA fucked them.

44:59.116 --> 45:00.951
You only hear about some guy

45:00.985 --> 45:03.821
who randomly decided to
bomb assholes in suits.

45:03.854 --> 45:06.490
- Not accurate.
- Great, that's great news.

45:07.191 --> 45:11.862
Totally relevant to my current
situation, and I also don't give a fuck.

45:11.895 --> 45:14.131
- Do you work for the CIA?
- No.

45:14.164 --> 45:15.933
Do you work for
the police or the FBI?

45:15.966 --> 45:19.136
No. I am not a cop
and I'm not an FBI agent.

45:19.169 --> 45:20.904
- Are you?
- I'm asking the questions.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.075
Are you a terrorist?

45:25.509 --> 45:27.478
That why you're up here
hiding like a snake?

45:27.511 --> 45:28.545
Watch it.

45:29.313 --> 45:30.114
Okay.

45:31.382 --> 45:32.249
You want the truth?

45:34.151 --> 45:37.021
Here's what I think. I think
you should get a fucking life,

45:37.488 --> 45:39.890
because nobody lives
out here in the woods

45:39.923 --> 45:42.960
unless you're a terrorist
or a crazy person

45:42.993 --> 45:46.897
or you're a lumberjack
and you don't have the hands.

45:48.265 --> 45:49.266
Hmm.

45:53.337 --> 45:56.373
Okay, the truth is
that I also like

45:56.407 --> 45:58.842
selling the pictures
I take of birds

45:58.876 --> 46:01.111
because it gets me
out of the house,

46:01.145 --> 46:02.946
and when I'm out of the house
I meet interesting men,

46:02.980 --> 46:04.481
and when I meet
interesting men...

46:06.383 --> 46:08.519
it's just, you know, hasn't
been the same with my husband

46:08.553 --> 46:09.353
and I just...

46:10.888 --> 46:12.022
I just want to get laid.

46:13.924 --> 46:18.062
I know. I know it's so clichÃ©,
but I just,

46:18.495 --> 46:20.964
I just want to
get fucked, man, like,

46:20.998 --> 46:22.933
I haven't been
touched in months, you know,

46:22.966 --> 46:25.436
and when I am,
it's just business.

46:26.303 --> 46:28.305
You got to relate
living up here, right?

46:29.139 --> 46:31.241
- I don't, I don't like to...
- And it's like...

46:31.275 --> 46:34.144
- ...talk about that.
- You know when you're just craving food,

46:34.178 --> 46:38.415
and all you think about is
food and what you want to eat?

46:39.116 --> 46:42.119
That's the same with sex.
It's like you just want to fuck,

46:42.152 --> 46:43.487
and it's on your mind
all the time.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.022
You just got
all these fantasies,

46:45.055 --> 46:47.257
and then, I just...

46:49.627 --> 46:52.129
I masturbate... a lot.

46:52.162 --> 46:55.165
- Good for you.
- No, it's not good for me.

46:55.199 --> 46:57.968
Okay, I don't like it, and it feels
like I'm cheating all the time,

46:58.001 --> 46:59.870
and I don't want to
feel like a rug,

47:00.304 --> 47:03.407
but it's just...
it's just not the same.

47:05.342 --> 47:07.612
- We used to fuck all the time.
- Okay, okay, enough.

47:08.412 --> 47:10.013
Why, what's the matter?

47:10.047 --> 47:11.415
I'm not your marriage counselor.

47:12.950 --> 47:15.919
But I'm sure you can relate. I mean,
you must get a lot of action up here

47:15.953 --> 47:18.222
living out in
butt-fuck nowhere.

47:22.025 --> 47:24.629
If you weren't crazy,
I'd fuck you.

47:26.530 --> 47:27.464
I'm not crazy.

47:28.666 --> 47:29.900
I'm not going to fuck you.

47:30.401 --> 47:32.269
It's really good with strangers.

47:33.036 --> 47:34.938
Save it for one of your
interesting men.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.941
Hey, you asked.

47:38.509 --> 47:39.644
That's why I like birding.

47:43.514 --> 47:44.515
I'm thirsty.

47:59.430 --> 48:01.198
Your friend broke
within minutes.

48:01.231 --> 48:03.601
- What friend?
- The spook upstairs.

48:03.635 --> 48:06.003
I don't know that guy.
I've never seen him in my life.

48:06.036 --> 48:08.205
Hey, and if you don't believe
me, why don't you inject me

48:08.238 --> 48:10.474
with some more of this
stuff and I'll prove it.

48:12.142 --> 48:14.111
Even if you are who you say you are,
you could still go to the police.

48:14.144 --> 48:16.447
No, I won't. I won't, I promise.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.583
How am I supposed
to believe you?

48:18.616 --> 48:21.385
Because I don't care what you're
doing up here or what you've done.

48:22.085 --> 48:25.022
- I've done nothing.
- I don't want to know, and I don't care.

48:37.501 --> 48:38.302
Get up.

48:40.738 --> 48:41.538
What?

48:43.708 --> 48:44.541
Come on.

48:45.509 --> 48:46.678
Where are you taking me?

48:47.277 --> 48:48.545
Where I know you can't escape.

48:49.112 --> 48:50.113
I've got something to do.

48:51.448 --> 48:52.249
Sorry.

49:17.675 --> 49:18.576
You again.

49:20.745 --> 49:22.312
Come on.

49:22.346 --> 49:23.715
You got to help me
get out of here.

49:25.382 --> 49:26.183
Don't bother.

49:29.119 --> 49:30.287
What is your problem?

49:30.688 --> 49:33.423
- Huh?
- My problem?

49:33.457 --> 49:36.728
No, no, no. We've been betrayed.

49:38.095 --> 49:40.430
We? No, okay.

49:41.532 --> 49:43.835
I'm just trying to get
back to civilization.

49:43.868 --> 49:46.303
- No, you work for them.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

49:46.336 --> 49:48.138
How many times do
I have to say it?

49:48.171 --> 49:50.407
I didn't obey my orders,
and now I'm on a kill list.

49:50.440 --> 49:52.209
Orders? What orders?

49:52.242 --> 49:55.512
Kill Riad, obtain the files,
encryption key, you know.

49:56.480 --> 49:59.516
Okay, great. Well, look,
if we get out of here,

49:59.551 --> 50:01.819
then you can go do
whatever you want, okay?

50:01.853 --> 50:05.590
No. He showed me the package...

50:07.692 --> 50:11.461
and now... we're on a countdown.

50:11.495 --> 50:14.566
Countdown, what?
Is something going to happen?

50:15.399 --> 50:18.235
He decrypted the majority
of the files.

50:18.268 --> 50:21.673
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That shit isn't real, okay?

50:21.706 --> 50:22.607
Ah, it is.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.174
I've seen it.

50:25.877 --> 50:29.112
The public deserves to know,
but it doesn't matter

50:29.146 --> 50:31.783
'cause they're just
going to kill us both

50:31.816 --> 50:32.784
and scrub the cabin.

50:32.817 --> 50:33.618
Oh.

50:35.319 --> 50:36.386
Oh, no.

50:39.724 --> 50:40.658
I said don't bother.

50:52.269 --> 50:53.738
Stay away from there.
Don't look in there.

51:02.212 --> 51:03.447
What the fuck?

51:11.188 --> 51:12.122
What's going on?

51:18.261 --> 51:19.162
Get back.

51:24.736 --> 51:25.670
I just pushed him.

51:28.271 --> 51:30.474
- You killed him.
- He tried to kill me.

51:30.908 --> 51:33.310
- He was an asset.
- What was he doing in a cell then, huh?

51:33.343 --> 51:34.511
He liked it.

51:36.114 --> 51:38.281
Where else do you want me to keep a
spook who was sent here to neutralize me?

51:41.853 --> 51:43.186
Jesus Christ!

51:43.821 --> 51:45.288
Jesus, what the fuck are you?

51:46.691 --> 51:48.593
Where's the key card?
Toss it over.

51:49.560 --> 51:50.895
Toss it over, now!

51:52.730 --> 51:55.365
- You're dangerous.
- It was an accident!

51:55.933 --> 51:59.269
No, please! Please don't
leave me in here with him!

52:01.304 --> 52:03.841
He had the opportunity to
leave and chose to remain!

52:04.474 --> 52:05.576
Maybe you'll feel the same!

52:08.813 --> 52:10.280
No.

52:10.848 --> 52:13.216
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!

53:09.574 --> 53:10.407
Hey!

53:12.076 --> 53:12.910
Hey!

53:14.511 --> 53:16.246
At least bring me
some fucking water!

53:54.018 --> 53:54.986
Fuck.

55:52.770 --> 55:53.838
Fuck!

56:12.623 --> 56:14.692
What the fuck? Stay back!
Stay the fuck back!

56:14.725 --> 56:16.694
Shut up, shut up!
Listen to me here, okay?

56:16.727 --> 56:19.096
You're being hunted.
Listen, there's a mailman,

56:19.130 --> 56:20.564
but he's not really
a mailman, okay?

56:20.598 --> 56:22.233
He has a gun and he's
coming to kill you,

56:22.266 --> 56:24.068
and if he kills you,
he kills me too.

56:24.101 --> 56:26.536
Inside!

56:26.570 --> 56:29.206
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Can't leave yet.

56:29.240 --> 56:30.775
I'm not getting back
in that house.

56:30.808 --> 56:32.910
We've got to go right now, okay?
Who is that guy?

56:32.944 --> 56:34.845
Your backup. Move.

56:34.879 --> 56:36.747
My car is right over
there, okay?

56:36.781 --> 56:37.581
Don't!

56:38.849 --> 56:40.450
This isn't a negotiation.

56:42.954 --> 56:45.189
You're surprisingly
resourceful for a photographer.

56:45.790 --> 56:47.558
Another one of your
tricks, I'm sure.

56:47.591 --> 56:49.226
Yeah, or maybe the mailman
teamed up with his buddies,

56:49.260 --> 56:51.095
the cable guy, the plumber,
the electrician.

56:52.229 --> 56:54.098
Down. Get down!

56:58.302 --> 56:59.469
Don't move.

57:03.774 --> 57:05.609
Fuck. Is this you?

57:06.243 --> 57:07.878
Of course not.

57:08.913 --> 57:10.047
We are going to have
to make a run for it.

57:10.081 --> 57:12.482
We? Are you ever
just going to let me go?

57:15.219 --> 57:18.055
- Come on.
- What are you hiding from anyway?

57:18.089 --> 57:20.257
Hiding? I'm dead.

57:20.291 --> 57:21.726
You don't look dead to me.

57:21.759 --> 57:23.127
No, I was a Marine
who went crazy

57:23.160 --> 57:24.729
and then committed suicide.

57:24.762 --> 57:25.763
At least that's the story.

57:25.796 --> 57:26.998
It made sense too.

57:27.031 --> 57:28.733
After all, my brother
was a traitor.

57:28.766 --> 57:30.101
It's enough to drive
a man insane, right?

57:31.068 --> 57:32.203
Does your family know?

57:32.837 --> 57:34.537
No, no family.

57:34.572 --> 57:36.173
I was working for the NSA
when they destroyed my brother.

57:36.207 --> 57:38.109
My parents are dead. They're going
to kill me for real this time

57:38.142 --> 57:40.277
over these damn files.

57:42.346 --> 57:43.247
What are they?

57:46.083 --> 57:46.917
This is Catalyst.

57:48.252 --> 57:49.954
It's a record
of domestic black ops

57:49.987 --> 57:52.623
designed to heighten fear
and subjugate rational thought

57:52.656 --> 57:55.059
among the general population,
starting with 9/11.

57:55.092 --> 57:57.028
Dozens of successful attacks,

57:57.061 --> 57:58.896
San Bernardino, Boston Marathon.

57:58.929 --> 57:59.964
Why would they do that?

58:05.069 --> 58:07.204
Fear equals funding.

58:07.238 --> 58:08.906
A little push creates
the opportunity,

58:08.939 --> 58:11.108
and a no-fly list up-and-comer
takes the bull by the horns.

58:11.142 --> 58:12.076
There's no way.

58:28.225 --> 58:30.294
Shh! No, wait!

58:30.327 --> 58:32.863
You'll make too much noise, he'll know
we're in here, you fucking lunatic!

58:36.801 --> 58:38.736
- Open the door.
- Go away!

58:38.769 --> 58:40.938
You think this is a coincidence?

58:40.971 --> 58:43.174
Then why this? Just leave
the crazy guy alone, right?

58:43.207 --> 58:45.342
Well, you did kidnap
a guy and hold him hostage,

58:45.376 --> 58:47.611
and you stole government files
for the sole purpose to leak them,

58:47.645 --> 58:49.146
so I can think of
a few fucking reasons.

58:49.180 --> 58:50.948
This is your fault.
You revealed my position.

58:50.981 --> 58:53.651
Oh, yeah, and then I told them
to kill me. Great plan.

58:55.719 --> 58:58.155
- I think you're missing the point!
- There is no point, okay?

58:58.189 --> 58:59.957
There's no reason
for this bullshit.

58:59.990 --> 59:01.959
The only way to subjugate
rational thought

59:01.992 --> 59:05.029
is fucking Facebook, 24-hour
news, and reality TV, okay?

59:05.062 --> 59:08.365
No need for hiding in a cabin and
covert NSA conspiracy bullshit.

59:08.399 --> 59:10.167
- Shut up!
- No.

59:10.201 --> 59:11.702
Look, why go down
that rabbit hole?

59:11.735 --> 59:13.037
Okay, it's a dark
and lonely place,

59:13.070 --> 59:14.705
and the bad guys will lose.

59:19.343 --> 59:21.645
You're naive,
and we're both going to die.

59:22.146 --> 59:24.014
It's guys like you
that are the problem.

59:24.048 --> 59:26.217
You think that you
can go against the system,

59:26.250 --> 59:28.886
but the system has its
checks and its balances.

59:28.919 --> 59:30.221
You actually believe that?

59:39.230 --> 59:41.899
- Drop the gun, Riad.
- Why would I do that?

59:42.700 --> 59:44.135
Miss Crane,
please take his weapon.

59:44.168 --> 59:45.336
How do you
know my name?

59:45.369 --> 59:47.671
This is your
failed operation.

59:47.705 --> 59:49.406
No. No, no, no,
no, no, that's a lie.

59:49.440 --> 59:51.275
- Fuck you.
- That's a lie. Look, you have to believe me.

59:51.308 --> 59:53.377
- Stay there.
- No, please.

59:54.311 --> 59:56.914
- Please, please, please, please.
- Wait, stop, don't...

59:56.947 --> 01:00:00.818
Look, I have nothing
to do with this, okay?

01:00:02.987 --> 01:00:05.122
Fuck.

01:00:05.156 --> 01:00:06.891
Listen!

01:00:08.926 --> 01:00:11.228
Get off her, get off!
Get over there!

01:00:11.262 --> 01:00:12.296
Don't move.

01:00:14.131 --> 01:00:15.299
Miss Crane, the gun, please.

01:00:16.133 --> 01:00:17.401
The gun, please.

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.076
Air-gapped computer.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.054
Miss Crane, is that everything?

01:00:39.423 --> 01:00:40.457
Is that everything?

01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:43.194
As far as I know.

01:01:17.428 --> 01:01:18.195
Get up.

01:01:20.798 --> 01:01:21.432
Move.

01:01:25.236 --> 01:01:26.036
Move!

01:01:27.504 --> 01:01:28.405
Over there, by the chair.

01:01:29.373 --> 01:01:30.407
What are you going to do?

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:33.177
Sit.

01:01:36.914 --> 01:01:38.015
Put these on him.

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.991
Tight.

01:01:50.261 --> 01:01:51.061
Now yours.

01:01:52.564 --> 01:01:54.398
Over there, Miss Crane.

01:01:54.431 --> 01:01:55.232
Sit.

01:01:59.103 --> 01:01:59.903
Tight.

01:02:28.098 --> 01:02:29.900
Your plan is faulty.
I'm already dead.

01:02:31.068 --> 01:02:32.369
That's easy enough to explain.

01:02:34.071 --> 01:02:35.472
Terrorist faking
his own death...

01:02:37.141 --> 01:02:38.542
and only now regretting
his actions.

01:02:40.978 --> 01:02:43.047
The guilt over killing
an innocent woman.

01:02:44.148 --> 01:02:45.549
You have a role to play
as well, Miss Crane.

01:02:47.051 --> 01:02:48.018
Get up.

01:02:49.453 --> 01:02:50.220
I said get up.

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:54.291
Stand up!

01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:05.169
<i>Status check,
code four, ready to deploy.</i>

01:03:05.202 --> 01:03:07.171
We're good. Stay put.

01:03:16.347 --> 01:03:18.349
Do you want me to draw this out?

01:03:18.382 --> 01:03:19.183
No.

01:03:20.918 --> 01:03:22.953
Get up. Get up!

01:04:37.027 --> 01:04:39.096
<i>Status check.
Agent, please respond.</i>

01:04:39.764 --> 01:04:41.031
<i>Please respond.</i>

01:04:58.215 --> 01:04:59.651
<i>Agent unresponsive.</i>

01:04:59.684 --> 01:05:00.685
<i>Deploy to engage target.</i>

01:06:33.778 --> 01:06:35.647
Huh, kind of embarrassing.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.748
Who do you work for, NSA?

01:06:37.615 --> 01:06:38.650
We'll find you.

01:06:39.449 --> 01:06:40.618
Oh, shit!

01:06:42.554 --> 01:06:45.188
Who are you? Huh?

01:06:45.222 --> 01:06:47.524
- Who are you?
- You're a dead man.

01:06:49.493 --> 01:06:50.795
Yeah, probably.

01:07:16.353 --> 01:07:18.522
What is the fucking password?

01:07:32.704 --> 01:07:34.271
You don't look so good.

01:07:34.304 --> 01:07:35.573
Backup's on the way.

01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:37.507
I thought you were going
to bleed out up there.

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:39.777
Stabbing me with
a compass was elegant.

01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:42.680
- My HQ will enjoy that one.
- Yeah, didn't stab you hard enough.

01:07:42.714 --> 01:07:44.514
Where's the flash drive?

01:07:44.548 --> 01:07:46.651
You're acting like
all this bullshit is real.

01:07:46.684 --> 01:07:49.186
- He's a total nut job.
- On your knees.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.556
Hands behind your back.

01:07:55.325 --> 01:07:56.728
Why the package, huh?
That was dumb.

01:07:56.761 --> 01:07:58.528
To send you a message.

01:07:59.196 --> 01:08:01.198
- You had no business interfering.
- Orders.

01:08:01.231 --> 01:08:02.934
Here's not your jurisdiction.

01:08:02.967 --> 01:08:05.570
- Hand over the drive.
- Convoluted idiocy.

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:07.872
- Vetted and approved.
- Oh, bullshit!

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.508
You were sloppy.

01:08:12.644 --> 01:08:13.845
That's it?

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.447
Doesn't matter.

01:08:22.787 --> 01:08:23.720
You're a hostage!

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.859
Hey, I saved your life, you saved mine.
How about we're even, okay?

01:08:28.893 --> 01:08:31.395
If you're so innocent, the authorities
will probably want to keep you alive.

01:08:31.428 --> 01:08:32.630
Yeah, well,
clearly I'm expendable.

01:08:32.663 --> 01:08:34.398
The postman was going
to shoot my head off.

01:08:41.572 --> 01:08:43.608
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.576
The flash drive, what do you
think? Did you take it?

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:46.611
No.

01:08:48.912 --> 01:08:50.514
Okay, time to leave.

01:08:51.015 --> 01:08:52.649
- I rigged the cabin to blow.
- What?

01:08:52.684 --> 01:08:54.251
We'll take your car.

01:08:54.283 --> 01:08:55.653
How about we just go
our separate ways, okay?

01:08:55.687 --> 01:08:57.654
Just drive! Get in!

01:08:57.689 --> 01:08:59.456
Okay, okay.

01:09:15.973 --> 01:09:17.506
This is really bad.

01:09:18.776 --> 01:09:20.812
Multiple covert actions failing
to take out a single target.

01:09:21.612 --> 01:09:23.648
- Pretty pathetic, actually.
- Holy shit, you're bleeding.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.649
I'll manage.

01:09:25.983 --> 01:09:27.484
Holy shit.

01:09:28.019 --> 01:09:30.654
- What was that?
- C-4 packs a punch.

01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:33.490
The explosion will distract them,
but they'll find us eventually.

01:09:33.523 --> 01:09:36.393
- I have a new location in mind.
- So it was a bomb.

01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:37.862
Well, there's bombs
and there's bombs.

01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:39.964
No more helicopters.

01:09:49.305 --> 01:09:50.675
<i>I thought we
discontinued this line.</i>

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:52.009
Ricochet, there's
been a problem.

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:53.578
We need to reinitiate.

01:09:55.046 --> 01:09:57.782
- <i>I can't.</i>
- Contingency protocol, secondary location.

01:09:57.815 --> 01:10:00.752
<i>Not possible. Getting the
files will be tough this time around.</i>

01:10:00.785 --> 01:10:02.920
No! This is for Ahmed.
You promised.

01:10:02.954 --> 01:10:05.590
- You owe him everything!
- <i>It's a terrible setback.</i>

01:10:05.623 --> 01:10:08.258
I'll contact you in six
hours with new instructions.

01:10:08.659 --> 01:10:10.628
I can't believe you have
a fucking phone, you asshole.

01:10:10.661 --> 01:10:12.930
It's a SAT phone on an encrypted
line, not for car repairs.

01:10:12.964 --> 01:10:14.699
You're something else,
you know that?

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:18.770
Who is that guy,
your friend, Ricochet?

01:10:19.336 --> 01:10:20.872
He's assistant to
the deputy director.

01:10:20.905 --> 01:10:22.506
- Of what?
- NSA.

01:10:23.908 --> 01:10:25.910
Bullshit. Why would he help you?

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.445
He served with Ahmed.
Ahmed saved his life.

01:10:28.813 --> 01:10:29.680
They were best friends.

01:10:31.015 --> 01:10:32.482
I don't believe you.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:35.352
You need to realize how
serious this situation is.

01:10:35.787 --> 01:10:38.790
It goes back to 9/11, the
World Trade bullion reserves.

01:10:38.823 --> 01:10:40.858
- Of course it does.
- Would you stop?

01:10:41.592 --> 01:10:44.095
200 billion dollars
in gold evaporated.

01:10:44.128 --> 01:10:45.930
That was the funding
for every damn program.

01:10:45.963 --> 01:10:48.465
It was the world's greatest
extortion and heist

01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:50.367
all rolled into one.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.671
- So this is about gold?
- No. It's about power, lost power.

01:10:54.839 --> 01:10:56.107
The gold was leveraged,

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.375
deposited into foreign
bank accounts.

01:10:58.408 --> 01:11:00.410
The bank accounts were leveraged
to create the covert ops,

01:11:00.443 --> 01:11:01.679
the covert ops create the fear,

01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:04.015
and the fear
redistributes power.

01:11:05.016 --> 01:11:07.018
And the American citizens
are the complacent sheep

01:11:07.051 --> 01:11:08.686
that let it all happen.

01:11:09.386 --> 01:11:10.888
Always bet on
the guy with the gold.

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.457
What, you're the guy who's just
going to come in and save the day?

01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:15.860
I saved your life.

01:11:15.893 --> 01:11:17.962
Yeah, you did, after you
did all that shit to me.

01:11:18.528 --> 01:11:21.132
And now you think that maybe
I was sent here to destroy you.

01:11:21.165 --> 01:11:23.034
- But you were, weren't you?
- What?

01:11:23.067 --> 01:11:24.101
Sent here to destroy me.

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:29.339
I think it's time
that you let me go.

01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:31.108
I'll let you go when I'm clear.

01:11:35.847 --> 01:11:38.115
Look, Riad, back in the cabin...

01:11:39.116 --> 01:11:40.718
you said something important
about change.

01:11:44.856 --> 01:11:46.423
And I just want you to know...

01:11:47.692 --> 01:11:48.593
that, um...

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.596
that whatever you're doing...

01:11:54.531 --> 01:11:56.868
whatever you think you're doing,
it's, it's, um...

01:11:58.569 --> 01:11:59.904
it doesn't just change
with one person.

01:12:02.206 --> 01:12:03.506
You're wrong.

01:12:04.575 --> 01:12:06.110
You're wrong.
One person is everything.

01:12:07.078 --> 01:12:09.914
Gandhi, Kennedy,
Martin Luther King.

01:12:09.947 --> 01:12:11.782
The lone wolf makes
the difference.

01:12:11.816 --> 01:12:13.584
Good guys, on the other hand,
they're the worst.

01:12:13.618 --> 01:12:16.621
They, they sit on their ass
while bad guys take over.

01:12:16.654 --> 01:12:17.989
Okay, and after all of that,

01:12:18.022 --> 01:12:20.625
after all the bullshit,
all the lies,

01:12:20.658 --> 01:12:21.893
the truth eventually comes out.

01:12:21.926 --> 01:12:23.761
Truth, truth finds a way?

01:12:23.794 --> 01:12:25.630
Truth won't do shit.

01:12:26.564 --> 01:12:28.666
- I'll find a way.
- At what cost?

01:12:28.699 --> 01:12:30.735
Assassination,
a couple gunshot wounds.

01:12:31.534 --> 01:12:33.436
They will get me, I know that,
just like they got my brother.

01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:34.705
It's just a matter of time.

01:12:35.472 --> 01:12:36.908
We're the ones
that get disappeared.

01:12:37.474 --> 01:12:38.876
Well, it's just easier
to waterboard you

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:40.477
and throw you in Guantanamo.

01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:42.647
Maybe that will happen,
but I need to be fearless.

01:12:43.014 --> 01:12:46.017
It takes one voice, one person
who has the courage to say enough.

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.619
Is that what you told the guy that
you kidnapped? Was that your pitch?

01:12:48.653 --> 01:12:50.988
Spook with a guilty conscience,
he confessed to a lot of shit.

01:12:51.022 --> 01:12:53.824
- Oh, so he was helping you.
- I think so. That's what he said.

01:12:53.858 --> 01:12:56.627
If he called in my location,
they would've been on me fast,

01:12:57.094 --> 01:12:58.696
but it, it gave me a chance...

01:13:00.564 --> 01:13:01.832
a window of opportunity.

01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:11.474
What was on that flash drive?

01:13:12.777 --> 01:13:14.578
Incontrovertible proof.

01:13:14.612 --> 01:13:16.446
That was what,
going to change the world?

01:13:17.782 --> 01:13:19.516
I don't know. Probably not.

01:13:22.219 --> 01:13:23.154
But it was something.

01:13:24.255 --> 01:13:25.189
A chink in the armor.

01:13:27.058 --> 01:13:28.225
I owe my brother that much.

01:13:31.528 --> 01:13:32.797
Should've let it go.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:33.864
What's done is done.

01:13:35.566 --> 01:13:36.801
I ran, they took steps.

01:13:39.103 --> 01:13:40.972
My bank account's locked.
My identity's gone.

01:13:43.841 --> 01:13:44.742
I'm barely a person.

01:13:47.544 --> 01:13:48.145
I'm sorry.

01:13:49.947 --> 01:13:50.715
I really am.

01:13:59.824 --> 01:14:02.126
Hey, I brought your
camera. You should thank me.

01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:06.263
Yeah, well, bird-watching seems
a little unimportant right now.

01:14:16.774 --> 01:14:18.876
- What are you doing?
- Appreciating your work.

01:14:18.909 --> 01:14:20.778
No, stop. Okay, that's private.

01:14:20.811 --> 01:14:22.079
Not if you're selling
them to a magazine.

01:14:24.215 --> 01:14:26.017
Okay,
that's enough, okay?

01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:27.585
No, you're good.
Don't be embarrassed.

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:29.620
Thanks.

01:14:31.956 --> 01:14:32.857
Look, I, um...

01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:35.760
I want to apologize.

01:14:37.128 --> 01:14:38.095
I, um...

01:14:39.697 --> 01:14:41.032
I think I, uh...

01:14:44.602 --> 01:14:46.003
<i>Simply
new surveillance tools...</i>

01:14:46.037 --> 01:14:48.906
- Riad?
- <i>...including a number of programs...</i>

01:14:48.939 --> 01:14:50.708
<i>Cellphone metadata and boomerang</i>

01:14:50.741 --> 01:14:52.143
<i>routing to prevent
economic espionage,</i>

01:14:52.176 --> 01:14:53.844
<i>and threats to Homeland
Security.</i>

01:14:53.878 --> 01:14:55.713
<i>These are high priority</i>

01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:57.915
- <i>national security threats.</i>
- Are you okay?

01:14:57.948 --> 01:14:59.850
<i>Foreign governments,
as well as terrorist cells,</i>

01:14:59.884 --> 01:15:01.852
<i>operating both inside
and outside...</i>

01:15:01.886 --> 01:15:03.888
Mr. Bishara, let me
officially welcome you

01:15:03.921 --> 01:15:06.057
to the very best of
the clandestine organizations.

01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:07.725
Riad.

01:15:09.126 --> 01:15:10.895
I do hope I'll be able to look into
my brother's situation as well.

01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:12.096
Absolutely.

01:15:12.663 --> 01:15:14.665
- Riad, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:15:14.698 --> 01:15:16.133
- I should really look at your shoulder.
- No! I said I'm fine.

01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:17.001
Okay.

01:15:24.075 --> 01:15:24.742
Actually, um...

01:15:26.677 --> 01:15:28.879
actually, you're, you're right,

01:15:28.913 --> 01:15:32.049
you should, um, you should
just pull over and let me out.

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:34.685
I'll take my bag and go.
I can...

01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:37.121
Keep you clear of this thing.

01:15:40.424 --> 01:15:41.358
Are you sure?

01:15:44.695 --> 01:15:45.763
Yeah.

01:15:50.868 --> 01:15:53.370
I, uh... made a mistake.

01:15:56.006 --> 01:15:57.341
Can I drive you into
town or anything?

01:15:57.975 --> 01:15:58.943
No, this is fine.

01:16:02.179 --> 01:16:03.147
Thank you.

01:16:03.848 --> 01:16:04.815
Yeah.

01:16:26.971 --> 01:16:29.073
- He sent you.
- Who?

01:16:29.106 --> 01:16:31.909
To eliminate the threat?
I'm the threat?

01:16:31.942 --> 01:16:33.210
No, please.

01:16:33.244 --> 01:16:34.011
Please, don't...

01:16:36.213 --> 01:16:38.282
Stop.

01:16:40.384 --> 01:16:42.253
No, no, you have it.

01:16:42.286 --> 01:16:43.854
I'm not crazy.

01:16:43.888 --> 01:16:45.723
The world needs to know
I'm not fucking crazy.

01:16:45.756 --> 01:16:47.958
No, no, no, no. I can stop them.

01:16:47.992 --> 01:16:49.193
Only I can stop them.

01:16:49.226 --> 01:16:50.694
We can stop them.

01:17:18.956 --> 01:17:20.291
Oh, no.

01:17:20.324 --> 01:17:21.692
Riad.

01:17:22.526 --> 01:17:24.728
Riad, I need you to tell
me the password, okay?

01:17:25.329 --> 01:17:26.263
Come closer.

01:17:48.018 --> 01:17:49.954
Text messages just pop up.

01:17:52.289 --> 01:17:53.724
Worst phone ever.

01:20:19.937 --> 01:20:20.938
Oh, my God.

01:20:29.446 --> 01:20:31.315
<i>Veracity
is questionable.</i>

01:20:31.348 --> 01:20:33.217
He has upset several
tangent agencies.

01:20:35.252 --> 01:20:37.354
Neutralize only. Be discrete.

01:20:38.088 --> 01:20:38.956
Expect interference.
