00:16.225 --> 00:20.479
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

00:20.771 --> 00:24.233
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Charlie, hey! Ice cream.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.239
Hey, buddy! Do you want
some ice cream? Yeah?

00:30.322 --> 00:33.408
Here, Charlie. Here you go.

00:35.244 --> 00:39.498
Look! There it goes!
Going to balloon land. Go bye-bye.

00:39.540 --> 00:44.002
- (baby cries)
- Oh, ssh. Oh, sweetie, don't cry.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.508
Hey, look. Here's some ice cream.
Want some ice cream?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.927
Look. Here.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.388
Teddy... Teddy, here's your balloon.

00:54.513 --> 00:58.225
- Look at that! Here you go.
- Oh! Such a mess.

00:58.267 --> 01:02.271
- We gotta clean you up.
- Charlie and I'll wait for you.

01:04.522 --> 01:08.110
- That was my balloon.
- Eat your ice cream before it melts.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.280
I don't want any ice cream. I want my balloon.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.283
We'll get you a balloon, OK?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.994
No. I want my balloon.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.413
Fine. We'll get you another balloon.

01:22.124 --> 01:24.585
That was a waste of good money.

01:34.553 --> 01:37.181
Ooh! There we go.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.184
Yes.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.978
OK. Ohh!

01:44.313 --> 01:47.774
There we go. That's a boy.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.611
What a good boy. OK.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.781
OK, Teddy. I'll be right back, OK?

01:56.742 --> 01:59.494
# There were six in the bed
and the little one said

01:59.620 --> 02:01.914
# Roll over, roll over

02:02.039 --> 02:04.499
# So they all rolled over and one fell out

02:04.625 --> 02:07.044
# Five in the bed and the little one said

02:07.085 --> 02:09.378
# Roll over, roll over

02:09.505 --> 02:12.508
# So they all rolled over and one fell out

02:12.591 --> 02:16.803
# Four in the bed and the little one said
roll over, roll over

02:16.929 --> 02:19.389
# So they all rolled over and one fell out

02:19.515 --> 02:24.102
# Three in the bed and the little one said
roll over, roll over

02:24.228 --> 02:26.939
# So they all rolled over and one fell out

02:27.064 --> 02:29.942
# Two in the bed and the little one said...

02:31.693 --> 02:33.529
Teddy?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.780
Teddy!

02:35.656 --> 02:37.783
Teddy!

02:39.326 --> 02:40.827
Teddy!

02:41.620 --> 02:43.372
Teddy!

02:43.956 --> 02:46.083
Teddy!

02:49.211 --> 02:50.629
Teddy!

03:13.694 --> 03:17.447
- There's a kid on the track!
- Oh, my God!

03:18.115 --> 03:20.450
Teddy!

03:20.576 --> 03:23.704
Teddy! Get away from there!

03:25.122 --> 03:27.291
Teddy!

03:27.875 --> 03:30.002
Teddy, come here!

03:32.421 --> 03:34.548
Damn!

03:34.590 --> 03:37.009
Teddy!

03:37.134 --> 03:39.887
Tell Teddy to get off the track!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.850
No!

03:47.019 --> 03:49.062
Oh, my God!

03:51.190 --> 03:53.317
Teddy?

03:59.990 --> 04:02.451
Maggie... Teddy...

04:11.452 --> 04:14.052
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 21 - The Calusari

04:57.130 --> 05:00.509
This was taken
at an amusement park three months ago.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.971
The young boy in the background
is Teddy Holvey, aged two.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.599
- He was killed seconds after this was taken.
- How?

05:07.683 --> 05:12.062
According to the police report, he wandered
in front of the miniature train.

05:12.145 --> 05:16.024
The conductor was unable to stop
due to malfunctioning brakes.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.485
Teddy's dad works
for the State Department.

05:18.569 --> 05:23.365
A coroner's inquest was held due to
the unusual circumstances of the accident.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.243
- Did the inquest find anything unusual?
- No.

05:26.326 --> 05:31.582
But the county medical examiner was
disturbed by this case and by this photo...

05:31.665 --> 05:33.876
...and I think with good reason.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.044
You see, this is a helium balloon.

05:36.128 --> 05:40.090
One thing I learnt in kindergarten
is when you let them go, they float up.

05:40.174 --> 05:46.638
- But this is moving away horizontally.
- Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?

05:46.722 --> 05:50.893
The National Weather Service say
on that day the wind was blowing north.

05:50.976 --> 05:55.522
But the balloon is moving south,
as if it's being pulled against the wind.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.941
- Pulled? By whom?
- I don't know.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.819
So I came to Chuck,
the king of digital imaging.

06:00.903 --> 06:05.032
Chuck can extract incredibly small details
from a photographic print.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.868
Not details. Information. Watch the monitor.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.623
We have limitations on how much
the eye can perceive unaided.

06:12.706 --> 06:19.296
But with this special software, which I
designed, we can detect hidden information.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.008
We can manipulate it, enhance it.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.555
Now watch right here.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.061
There it is.

06:34.144 --> 06:38.315
It's clearly a concentration
of electromagnetic energy.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.444
So you're saying that, uh...
a ghost killed Teddy Holvey?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.490
Did anyone check
the camera that took the photo?

06:46.573 --> 06:49.868
- The lens or the pressure plate?
- It all checked out, Scully.

06:50.619 --> 06:54.665
I think this is clearly
some kind of poltergeist activity.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.085
This is the same reason
why you'll see a newspaper photo...

06:58.168 --> 07:02.381
...with Jesus' face appearing
in the foliage of an elm tree.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.133
It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.

07:05.217 --> 07:09.054
To get on the tracks, Teddy Holvey
escaped this childproof halter...

07:09.137 --> 07:13.267
...that his mom had tied to a sink.
- I've seen some slippery two-year-olds.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.686
So the CME put it on his own two-year-old...

07:15.769 --> 07:19.022
...and found it was impossible
for the kid to free himself.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.401
So unless Teddy was
the reincarnation of Houdini...

07:22.484 --> 07:25.612
And that would be an <font color="#00FF00">X-File</font> in itself.

08:00.856 --> 08:05.068
I don't understand.
There's already been a formal inquest.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.696
We're here apart from that investigation.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.574
We believe something
may have been overlooked.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.951
Like what?

08:13.035 --> 08:17.664
The possibility Teddy
may have been helped onto the tracks.

08:17.748 --> 08:20.959
- Oh, my God.
- There were over a hundred witnesses.

08:21.043 --> 08:27.007
We saw Teddy ourselves. He was chasing
a balloon. There was no one else around.

08:27.382 --> 08:32.554
It was an awful accident,
but that's all it was-an accident.

08:32.638 --> 08:37.643
Do you have any reason to suspect
someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?

08:37.726 --> 08:41.730
He was just a baby.
Why would anybody want to hurt him?

08:41.813 --> 08:45.275
I don't know what you're
getting at. We loved Teddy.

08:45.359 --> 08:51.031
If you're suggesting this is like that woman
who drowned her kids, you're way out of line.

08:51.114 --> 08:56.119
Mrs Holvey, did you hear anything in the
bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?

08:56.203 --> 08:59.289
I already told the inquest I heard nothing.

09:00.123 --> 09:04.461
Mrs Holvey, at the time of the accident
did you have any hired help?

09:04.545 --> 09:08.924
No. My mother came to live with us
once Teddy was born.

09:09.007 --> 09:14.513
Around the time of Teddy's death, had you
noticed anything strange happening?

09:14.596 --> 09:17.182
Things moved, odd objects appearing?

09:19.101 --> 09:22.104
It's that damn smoke detector.
I'll be right back.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.072
Does this happen often?

09:32.155 --> 09:35.868
It's an old house.
We have a problem with the wiring.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.371
(speaks Romanian)

09:41.206 --> 09:43.417
- Mother.
- Diavolo!

09:43.500 --> 09:45.711
Mother, it was just a false alarm.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.423
No! (speaks Romanian)

09:54.052 --> 09:56.054
Mother! Stop it!

09:56.263 --> 09:58.640
What is she saying?

09:58.724 --> 10:01.935
- Maggie!
- You marry a devil.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.522
You have devil child!

10:09.610 --> 10:12.070
I'm sorry.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.830
D'you recognise this?

10:21.914 --> 10:25.375
- It's a swastika.
- It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.295
It's an ancient symbol
used for protection or good luck...

10:28.378 --> 10:31.298
...used by various cultures
since the Middle Ages.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.218
The child had one on
the back of his hand last night.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.554
My guess? It was drawn
by the old lady-to protect the boy.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.141
- Yes, I saw her drawing it.
- You didn't think that was strange?

10:41.225 --> 10:44.436
I think this boy needs
as much protection as he can get...

10:44.520 --> 10:47.814
...but just not from ghosties
or beasties. Look at this.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.237
Have you ever heard of
MÃ¼nchhausen by proxy?

10:53.320 --> 10:56.406
Yeah, my grandfather used
to take it for his stomach.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.284
When a parent or caretaker
brings harm to a child...

10:59.368 --> 11:03.705
...by inducing symptoms, usually as
a way of getting attention or status.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.874
Look at Teddy's medical history.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.753
You'll see that he was admitted
to various hospitals ten times...

11:09.837 --> 11:13.841
...during the two years he was alive.
That's once every three months.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.260
Projectile vomiting at three months...

11:16.343 --> 11:19.930
...diarrhoea at four months,
vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea...

11:20.013 --> 11:23.141
Each time they were unable
to determine the cause.

11:23.225 --> 11:27.604
- And no one questioned this?
- The family moved around with Steve's job.

11:27.688 --> 11:31.275
Records take time to transfer
from hospital to hospital.

11:31.358 --> 11:37.072
But this abuse is not limited to just one child,
so I checked out Charlie's history as well.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.576
- He had medical problems too?
- Since his brother was born...

11:40.659 --> 11:43.871
...which is right when
Holvey's mother-in-law moved in.

11:43.954 --> 11:49.168
Often the perpetrator of MÃ¼nchhausen
by proxy will view the child as evil.

11:49.251 --> 11:54.756
The old woman would be a likely candidate,
but it could be any family member.

11:54.840 --> 11:59.553
Do you feel like taking a walk
over to the State Department, Scully?

12:05.809 --> 12:11.815
Things have been strange since Golda,
my mother-in-law, moved in with us.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.985
I met Maggie in Romania in 1984.

12:15.068 --> 12:19.615
Golda forbade our marriage,
said I was the devil.

12:19.698 --> 12:23.660
After I transferred back to the US,
things got somewhat better...

12:23.744 --> 12:28.123
...until Teddy was born
and she came to live with us.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.376
That's when the strangeness really started.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.545
What kind of strangeness?

12:33.629 --> 12:36.089
Superstitions rule Golda's life.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.676
She'll spit if anyone compliments the kids.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.723
Once she moved in, she poured hot water
over the threshold to ward off demons...

12:44.806 --> 12:47.643
...tied red strings around the kids' wrists.

12:47.726 --> 12:51.313
One day I caught her
throwing chicken guts on the roof.

12:51.396 --> 12:55.234
Then Teddy and Charlie
started getting sick... a lot.

12:55.317 --> 13:00.489
- And you suspect Golda?
- She'll call Charlie evil right to his face.

13:00.572 --> 13:04.701
But at the same time she dotes on him
like... she's afraid of him.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.412
Afraid of him or for him?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.831
I just don't know.

13:09.915 --> 13:13.710
Are you familiar with
MÃ¼nchhausen by proxy?

13:13.794 --> 13:16.421
Are you accusing us of child abuse?

13:17.506 --> 13:21.468
Teddy's medical records
have raised some questions.

13:22.553 --> 13:25.138
I could never say this to Maggie, but...

13:26.473 --> 13:32.312
...l've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck
in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.

13:33.730 --> 13:39.152
I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr
Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.661
This is gonna be hard.

13:47.953 --> 13:51.373
- Maggie!
- What do they want? To take Charlie away?

13:51.456 --> 13:54.293
They just want him
to talk with a social worker.

13:54.376 --> 13:58.755
- They'll put lies into Charlie's head.
- You're being unreasonable.

13:58.839 --> 14:03.177
You want to take him away! You blame me
for Teddy and you want to take him away.

14:03.260 --> 14:09.308
I won't listen to this. This is ridiculous! If you
wanna come, you can. I'm taking Charlie now.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.102
No, Steven!

14:12.186 --> 14:16.148
- What was that?
- (speaks Romanian)

14:16.231 --> 14:19.234
Come on, Charlie, let's get your coat.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.654
- You have no right to do this!
- Maggie.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.910
Come on. We'll meet you out front.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.273
- OK, you buckled in there?
- Yeah.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.533
Dammit!

15:35.769 --> 15:37.563
No! No!

15:37.980 --> 15:40.566
Daddy! No!

15:40.649 --> 15:42.442
Noooo!

15:43.610 --> 15:46.488
No! Daddy!

15:46.572 --> 15:48.198
No!

15:51.827 --> 15:53.996
Mulder.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.832
Daddy!

15:59.209 --> 16:01.962
Daddy! No!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.590
Daddy!

16:04.673 --> 16:06.466
No!

16:07.801 --> 16:11.346
Daddy! Daddy!

16:28.405 --> 16:30.824
You see this?

17:35.097 --> 17:38.475
- Find anything?
- Yeah, maybe.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.484
It looks like ash.

17:47.568 --> 17:50.279
Yeah. It's everywhere. Look at this.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.659
The Holveys said earlier
they had problems with the wiring.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.954
- It could be the motor shorted out.
- No, the motor's fine.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.749
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know, but I'll have this analysed.

18:02.833 --> 18:06.086
Before we do anything,
we should get Charlie out of here.

18:06.170 --> 18:09.840
I called a social worker
who's gonna come down and make a report.

18:09.923 --> 18:14.761
- The courts will be reluctant to intervene.
- Not when a child is in danger.

18:14.845 --> 18:19.600
And not after they see two dead roosters
in the old woman's bedroom.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.768
Really?

18:21.852 --> 18:26.273
- Still think this is MÃ¼nchhausen by proxy?
- Without a doubt.

18:26.690 --> 18:30.277
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.450
Stay away from our house!

18:45.292 --> 18:48.545
- Hey. You wanna see something weird?
- What?

18:48.629 --> 18:51.840
Chem lab analysis of
the ash from the Holveys' house.

18:51.924 --> 18:55.511
No trace of any metal,
no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.

18:55.594 --> 18:58.972
- What do you mean?
- It contains nothing organic or inorganic.

18:59.056 --> 19:04.770
In fact, according to the technicians,
this ash doesn't exist. Come on.

19:06.897 --> 19:10.025
- Where are we going?
- To get a second opinion.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.532
Oh, wow!

19:17.908 --> 19:21.995
Haven't seen this for a while.
Not since India, 1979.

19:22.371 --> 19:25.290
- India?
- Before Chuck succumbed to academia...

19:25.415 --> 19:30.462
...he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.
- It's called vibuti.

19:31.505 --> 19:37.094
Holy ash. Technically it's called an apport -
something that materialises out of thin air.

19:37.177 --> 19:40.222
Wait a second.
Nothing materialises out of thin air.

19:40.305 --> 19:44.560
You've read the Bible? Remember
Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?

19:44.643 --> 19:49.648
- Yeah, but that was a parable.
- In 1979 I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba...

19:49.731 --> 19:52.067
...create an entire feast out of thin air.

19:52.150 --> 19:58.031
Too bad you didn't take a picture and use
your computer to see the entire Last Supper.

19:58.532 --> 20:03.370
Vibuti is created during the presence
of spirit beings or during bilocation...

20:03.453 --> 20:08.876
...which is a phenomenon where a person's
energy is transported to a different location.

20:08.959 --> 20:12.713
That energy could have been
what set off the garage-door opener.

20:12.796 --> 20:15.966
Yeah, that-or somebody
activated the remote control.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.385
Well, who are you suggesting did that?

20:18.468 --> 20:22.389
Who was standing outside when
the garage door opened on us yesterday?

20:22.472 --> 20:25.726
The old lady... and Charlie.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.398
(chanting in Romanian)

21:13.065 --> 21:15.984
(boy cries out in Romanian)

21:31.750 --> 21:37.089
Mrs Holvey? My name is Karen Kosseff.
I'm a social worker with the FBI.

21:37.172 --> 21:40.717
I've been instructed
to file a report for the court.

21:42.094 --> 21:44.930
- May I come in?
- No.

21:46.098 --> 21:51.144
- Please, I've already had enough trouble.
- I understand, Mrs Holvey.

21:51.228 --> 21:54.773
But if you won't talk to me,
I'll have to put that in the report...

21:54.857 --> 21:58.819
...and it could very well
complicate your situation.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.996
- Mommy!
- Charlie?

22:15.961 --> 22:18.297
Oh, my God!

22:18.380 --> 22:20.507
Charlie! It's OK, Charlie.

22:20.591 --> 22:24.261
It's OK. It's OK, Charlie. It's OK.

22:24.344 --> 22:29.433
He's been sick. My mother was
supposed to be looking after him.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.272
Mother? Mother!

22:36.940 --> 22:40.903
- (Golda speaks Romanian)
- Get out of my house!

22:40.986 --> 22:43.197
(speaks Romanian)

22:43.822 --> 22:45.824
(speaks Romanian)

22:46.742 --> 22:48.535
Get out!

23:09.723 --> 23:11.850
I have had enough, Mother.

23:13.644 --> 23:16.021
I want you out of my house.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.190
(Golda speaks Romanian)

23:19.358 --> 23:21.568
No!

23:21.652 --> 23:24.696
Mother! Mother!

23:24.780 --> 23:27.324
(speaks Romanian)

23:27.908 --> 23:29.409
Mother!

23:36.834 --> 23:40.879
The grandmother's taken the child
and locked him in the room with her.

23:40.963 --> 23:44.424
- She may have a knife. I've called 911.
- What happened?

23:44.508 --> 23:48.846
There were three strange men.
They were performing some kind of ritual.

23:48.929 --> 23:51.682
No! No, Nanna!

24:09.700 --> 24:11.785
(speaks Romanian)

24:14.580 --> 24:16.665
It is the only way.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.668
No!

24:26.175 --> 24:28.260
Mother!

24:28.969 --> 24:32.014
(speaks Romanian)

24:48.071 --> 24:50.449
Oh, my God!

24:50.532 --> 24:52.618
Oh, no!

24:55.412 --> 24:58.749
Mother! Mother!

25:24.858 --> 25:29.112
- Did you talk to Charlie?
- He says he doesn't remember anything.

25:29.196 --> 25:33.075
The coroner's preliminary report
says she died of a heart attack.

25:33.158 --> 25:36.411
But those wounds...
I'd swear her eyes were pecked out.

25:36.495 --> 25:40.958
There was more ash on the floor beneath
the old woman's body. And look at this.

25:41.041 --> 25:45.671
- What is it?
- It's mugwort. I think it's a ceremonial herb.

25:45.754 --> 25:49.508
- Was this a ritual killing?
- No, the reverse swastika on the window...

25:49.591 --> 25:53.011
...and the red string around his wrist
are protective devices.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.597
- Protection against what?
- I don't know.

25:55.681 --> 26:00.435
But the old woman knew the family was
in trouble. Those men were here to help her.

26:00.519 --> 26:04.064
I told you before,
get out of my house!

26:06.108 --> 26:08.402
(speaks Romanian)

26:11.905 --> 26:15.284
I am not interested in your superstition.

26:15.367 --> 26:18.078
Now get out. Now!

26:21.164 --> 26:24.084
- Mrs Holvey?
- It's all right.

26:24.168 --> 26:27.629
- Who are they?
- They are the Calusari.

26:27.713 --> 26:32.176
In Romania they are responsible for
the correct observance of sacred rites.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.761
What did he say?

26:35.512 --> 26:38.056
He said it's not over.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.935
- The evil is still here.
- Excuse me.

26:45.564 --> 26:48.942
Sir? Can I have a word with you?

26:49.026 --> 26:53.989
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
I'd like to ask you some questions.

26:54.072 --> 26:59.369
You were trying to protect the family, weren't
you? You said there was still evil here.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.873
Sir! I can arrest you if I have to.

27:05.334 --> 27:09.296
The evil that is here has always been.

27:09.379 --> 27:12.716
It has gone by different names
through history.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.677
Cain, Lucifer, Hitler.

27:15.761 --> 27:20.057
It does not care if it kills
one boy or a million men.

27:21.141 --> 27:26.939
If you try to stop us,
the blood will be on your hands.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.678
Mrs Holvey?

27:58.512 --> 28:03.851
I know this is a difficult time, but there are
some questions that need to be answered.

28:03.934 --> 28:07.062
My mother used to say that evil follows evil.

28:08.397 --> 28:13.193
Once someone suffers a misfortune,
they'll always have bad luck.

28:14.361 --> 28:18.282
I used to think that was just a superstition.

28:18.365 --> 28:21.702
Now I don't know what to believe.

28:24.496 --> 28:27.249
I blamed her, you know?

28:27.332 --> 28:29.626
For all that's happened.

28:30.711 --> 28:34.965
I thought maybe she was
putting a curse on us to punish me.

28:35.048 --> 28:38.218
Punish you for what?

28:38.302 --> 28:41.013
For abandoning the old ways.

28:41.972 --> 28:45.726
I was raised to believe, as she did, in spirits.

28:46.602 --> 28:48.687
The unseen world.

28:50.314 --> 28:55.235
When I married Steve and came
to this country, I left all that behind.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.740
Do you know what kind of ceremony
she was performing upstairs?

29:02.284 --> 29:05.412
She was trying to cleanse the house of evil.

29:07.414 --> 29:10.542
She thought Charlie
was responsible somehow.

29:13.420 --> 29:17.174
How could he be responsible
for all this horror?

29:18.342 --> 29:21.178
He's just a little boy!

29:27.392 --> 29:33.232
I think we should talk to Charlie and find out
what happened in your mother's bedroom.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.158
Charlie?

29:43.242 --> 29:47.829
I was told they found you in
your grandmother's room yesterday.

29:49.039 --> 29:51.542
Can you tell me about it?

29:55.921 --> 29:58.465
Do you remember how you got there?

29:58.549 --> 30:00.634
No.

30:01.343 --> 30:04.096
Your mother said
you were there. Remember?

30:04.179 --> 30:06.557
I wasn't there!

30:07.599 --> 30:10.102
Many people saw you in the room.

30:10.185 --> 30:13.021
It wasn't me! I wasn't there! It wasn't me!

30:13.105 --> 30:15.315
- Who was in the room?
- No!

30:15.399 --> 30:18.443
Was there someone else in the room?

30:18.527 --> 30:21.113
No! I didn't hurt her!

30:21.196 --> 30:23.073
Charlie? Charlie!

30:23.156 --> 30:25.826
Who hurt your grandmother? Charlie!

30:25.909 --> 30:28.745
- It was him!
- Who, Charlie? Who?

30:29.037 --> 30:31.832
It was Michael! Michael!

30:32.875 --> 30:35.043
Mrs Holvey?

30:35.127 --> 30:37.754
We never told him.

30:37.838 --> 30:40.966
It was agreed upon. It was our secret.

30:42.134 --> 30:45.220
What secret, Mrs Holvey?
What are you talking about?

30:45.304 --> 30:47.556
Michael.

30:47.639 --> 30:50.893
He was Charlie's twin.

30:50.976 --> 30:53.312
He was stillborn.

30:56.607 --> 31:00.986
Steven and I agreed
never to tell Charlie about it.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.283
My mother...

31:06.366 --> 31:11.455
...she wanted to perform a ritual of separation
when she heard of Michael's death -

31:11.538 --> 31:14.041
...to divide their souls.

31:16.001 --> 31:21.798
She said... if we didn't,
the world of the dead would follow Charlie.

31:23.217 --> 31:26.136
But it was just a superstition.

31:26.220 --> 31:29.014
Help! I need your help.

31:29.097 --> 31:31.642
- Charlie?
- He's having some kind of seizure.

31:31.725 --> 31:35.479
Don't restrain him.
Let's turn him on his side.

31:35.562 --> 31:38.106
Charlie, you're going to be OK.

31:42.319 --> 31:45.614
- How's Charlie?
- He's resting. How's Mrs Holvey?

31:45.697 --> 31:50.369
I'm amazed she hasn't broken down.
She's in the waiting room, trying to sleep.

31:50.452 --> 31:56.166
The doctor said that Charlie had a seizure,
but they're unable to determine the cause.

31:58.502 --> 32:02.589
I'm sorry, Charlie. I didn't mean
to scare you. I'm Nurse Castor.

32:02.673 --> 32:05.717
I'm just gonna give you
something to help you sleep.

32:05.801 --> 32:10.097
- No, I don't want a shot!
- I know, but if you spit out your medicine...

32:10.180 --> 32:12.683
...we have to give it to you some other way.
- No!

32:12.766 --> 32:16.395
Just relax. It won't hurt.
Afterwards I'll give you a sticker.

32:16.478 --> 32:19.773
- Leave me alone!
- Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch.

32:19.857 --> 32:22.276
- Now I want you to relax.
- Stop it!

32:22.359 --> 32:25.153
- Charlie... Now, I want you to behave.
- Leave me alone!

32:25.362 --> 32:31.076
- Charlie, I want you to behave. Just relax.
- No! Don't do it! Don't do it!

32:31.660 --> 32:33.287
No, Michael!

32:33.579 --> 32:35.706
Michael, don't!

33:02.399 --> 33:04.484
Mommy?

33:06.028 --> 33:09.448
- I want to go home now.
- Charlie?

33:09.531 --> 33:12.951
What are you doing up?
Why are you dressed?

33:13.035 --> 33:15.162
They said I could go home now.

33:16.747 --> 33:19.625
- Who said that?
- The doctors.

33:19.708 --> 33:22.085
They said I could leave.

33:24.963 --> 33:27.216
All right, then.

33:27.299 --> 33:29.426
Let's just get your coat.

33:29.510 --> 33:33.055
- And we'll talk to the doctors.
- No, Mommy.

33:33.138 --> 33:35.807
Let's just go home. Now!

33:39.603 --> 33:42.189
OK, Charlie.

33:42.272 --> 33:44.775
We'll go straight home.

33:55.786 --> 33:58.288
What are you looking at?

33:59.581 --> 34:01.959
- Is that Mrs Holvey?
- Where?

34:02.876 --> 34:05.504
There.

34:05.587 --> 34:08.297
I think she's got Charlie with her.

34:16.306 --> 34:18.391
Ohh...

34:19.141 --> 34:21.228
Oh.

34:22.521 --> 34:24.773
Nurse!

34:24.857 --> 34:27.192
- Are you all right?
- He hit me.

34:27.275 --> 34:29.695
- Who? Charlie?
- No, not him. The other one.

34:29.777 --> 34:33.156
There were two of them. Two boys.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.744
- You gotta get to Mrs Holvey.
- Why?

34:37.828 --> 34:40.746
The boy who left with
Mrs Holvey wasn't Charlie.

34:40.831 --> 34:44.376
- Are you saying she left with a ghost?
- Or a spirit. I'm not sure.

34:44.458 --> 34:49.005
It's what was in the photo and what the
old woman tried to protect the family from.

34:49.089 --> 34:55.137
It's killed three people. You've got to get
to Mrs Holvey's before it happens again.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.223
- What are you gonna do?
- Get help.

35:04.146 --> 35:07.316
- There you go, Charlie.
- Aren't you going to have some?

35:07.399 --> 35:10.235
No, dear. I'm not hungry.

35:10.319 --> 35:14.740
- Tomorrow we can go to the park.
- Yes. Sure.

35:15.866 --> 35:18.202
Can I have a balloon?

35:19.244 --> 35:20.829
Uh-huh.

35:22.915 --> 35:25.125
Can we ride the train, Mommy?

35:32.966 --> 35:36.720
Now, you finish up
and Mommy will be right back, OK?

35:49.358 --> 35:51.652
(speaks Romanian)

36:16.260 --> 36:19.388
Please God, don't let it be true.

36:37.656 --> 36:40.158
What are you doing, Mommy?

36:48.625 --> 36:52.546
- (chants in Romanian)
- Mommy?

37:18.155 --> 37:20.490
Guard the door.

37:26.288 --> 37:27.956
Mrs Holvey?

37:53.690 --> 37:55.776
Hello?

37:58.820 --> 38:01.698
(chanting in Romanian)

38:30.018 --> 38:32.729
(cries out in Romanian)

39:00.465 --> 39:02.759
(speaks Romanian)

39:06.847 --> 39:09.057
Come hold him down.

39:19.735 --> 39:25.240
Don't look at it!
Look away or it will recognise you.

40:05.322 --> 40:07.824
(Maggie chants in Romanian)

40:28.512 --> 40:30.681
Charlie?

40:31.348 --> 40:33.809
Mommy?

40:33.892 --> 40:36.520
(chants in Romanian)

40:51.743 --> 40:54.913
(shouts in Romanian)

41:05.340 --> 41:06.967
It hurts!

41:08.302 --> 41:10.470
Do not let go! He tricks you.

42:19.706 --> 42:22.835
- Are you all right?
- Charlie?

42:30.425 --> 42:32.928
Let the boy rest.

42:35.264 --> 42:38.642
We must find the mother. The boy needs her.

42:56.910 --> 43:00.873
- Scully, are you all right?
- We're OK. How's Charlie?

43:03.917 --> 43:06.503
Charlie!

43:06.587 --> 43:09.715
Hello, sweetie. Charlie!

43:09.798 --> 43:12.509
It is over... for now.

43:14.261 --> 43:17.681
But you must be careful. It knows you.

43:30.194 --> 43:33.280
The case of Charlie Holvey
and the deaths that occurred...

43:33.363 --> 43:38.285
...during his possession by a dark
and malevolent force are unsolved.

43:39.453 --> 43:44.958
The boy, who celebrates his tenth birthday
next month, is under the care of his mother.

43:45.042 --> 43:50.088
Though I believe him to be innocent, I am
disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari:

43:50.172 --> 43:56.428
...that neither innocence nor vigilance may be
protection against the howling heart of evil.
