WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:01.934
I though you said
she was in the bathroom.

00:02.003 --> 00:03.937
<i>She was...
No, she's not in there!</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:07.198
It's a kidnapping.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.136
I never should have let them
come here!

00:10.211 --> 00:11.371
We'll find her.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.609
<i>You couldn't
knock me out of the air,</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:16.843
so is that when you decided
to kidnap my little girl?

00:16.918 --> 00:19.045
People take children
for all kinds of reasons.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.314
<i>Not all of them are money.</i>

00:20.388 --> 00:22.151
We're losing the signal.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.784
They're trying to draw you away.

02:03.893 --> 02:07.590
Then we're gonna go in your dad's
helicopter and fly you all over... Hi.

02:07.663 --> 02:09.995
<i>Fly you all over, and then
we're gonna go have a luau.</i>

02:10.066 --> 02:11.055
What is a luau?

02:11.367 --> 02:14.234
<i>Oh, it's a picnic at night, and
they roast a pig. It's great.</i>

02:15.004 --> 02:18.269
<i>Ooh, those little pigs
with curly tails?</i>

02:22.178 --> 02:24.806
It'll be great. You'll love it.
You'll see the Hawaiian dancers...

02:24.880 --> 02:26.074
Oops! Excuse us.

02:26.282 --> 02:29.012
<i>Not big enough? You can
read it from a mile away!</i>

02:30.753 --> 02:32.618
<i>Hey, they're gonna love it.</i>

02:33.356 --> 02:37.258
<i>You know, there's no place for
a banner like this at my place.</i>

02:39.462 --> 02:42.727
<i>I mean, this is a much
better place to have a party.</i>

02:42.965 --> 02:45.661
There's more room
for the kids to play.

02:45.768 --> 02:46.860
Come on.

02:46.936 --> 02:48.028
Where's my dad?

02:48.104 --> 02:50.163
<i>He'll be here soon. You know,
our plane was a little early.</i>

02:50.239 --> 02:51.331
Oh.

02:51.407 --> 02:53.841
I have to use the bathroom!

02:54.310 --> 02:57.473
<i>Oh. Okay, here. Why don't you go on in there?</i>

02:57.580 --> 02:58.774
<i>Bryant, you stay with her,</i>

02:58.848 --> 03:00.042
<i>and I'll get the luggage, okay? Okay.</i>

03:14.764 --> 03:18.029
The barbecue alone would
take up half my balcony.

03:18.567 --> 03:21.968
Wait until they see the tidal
pool. They are going to love it!

03:22.071 --> 03:24.562
Robin's Nest is the perfect place for kids.

03:24.674 --> 03:26.335
<i>I mean, it was like
it was built for 'em.</i>

03:26.409 --> 03:30.277
<i>Well, maybe not on the inside, but out here
on the grounds where nothing can get broken?</i>

03:30.379 --> 03:32.404
<i>I mean, it's just
absolutely perfect!</i>

03:32.481 --> 03:33.573
You don't have to convince me.

03:33.683 --> 03:36.174
I always thought it was a good
idea to have the party here.

03:37.887 --> 03:38.876
Oh.

03:39.288 --> 03:41.620
I guess I was just practicing
my speech for Higgins.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.717
<i>Come on, Rick!
What's going on?</i>

03:44.860 --> 03:46.191
They got me on hold.

03:46.295 --> 03:47.956
That's what you said
five minutes ago.

03:48.030 --> 03:50.055
Yes! Flight 460!

03:50.199 --> 03:53.293
<i>Relax. Look, their plane's
not due for another hour.</i>

03:54.337 --> 03:55.770
It's already on the ground?

03:55.905 --> 03:57.099
What?

03:57.306 --> 03:58.739
Tail wind.

04:02.545 --> 04:05.571
<i>Leis... Leis... Where are the
leis? Front seat, where you put 'em.</i>

04:05.815 --> 04:07.840
Can't believe I'm gonna be late.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.847
They're with your friend
Donna! They'll be fine!

04:29.038 --> 04:31.871
<i>Bryant, where's Melody?</i>

04:32.174 --> 04:34.506
She's still in the bathroom.
She's still in the bath...

04:34.710 --> 04:36.837
Hold this.
Let me go get her.

04:39.949 --> 04:40.938
Melody?

04:42.918 --> 04:43.907
Melody?

04:47.189 --> 04:48.315
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

04:48.391 --> 04:50.985
<i>For those destined to
downtown Honolulu and Waikiki,</i>

04:51.060 --> 04:55.224
<i>the Wiki-Wiki bus will depart from
the South Terminal exit in ten minutes.</i>

05:10.780 --> 05:11.940
I don't know what happened.

05:12.014 --> 05:13.072
I went to get the luggage
while she waited.

05:13.149 --> 05:15.174
<i>I came back,
and she wasn't there.</i>

05:20.055 --> 05:23.354
<i>We have a little lost
girl. Black, 10 years old,</i>

05:23.426 --> 05:25.451
<i>approximately 47 inches tall,</i>

05:25.995 --> 05:28.862
wearing a gray dress and a
yellow ribbon in her hair.

05:29.932 --> 05:31.627
I could have
let the luggage wait.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.964
Did you happen to notice anyone
on the plane or in the terminal

05:34.036 --> 05:35.833
who seemed overly
interested in Melody?

05:37.740 --> 05:40.368
<i>No, I didn't notice
anybody like that.</i>

05:40.576 --> 05:42.066
<i>It got busy, and I...</i>

05:42.812 --> 05:45.110
I couldn't keep an eye on them.

05:45.247 --> 05:46.680
<i>I mean, I had to...</i>

05:46.816 --> 05:48.613
I had to serve the in-flight
meal. I was working.

05:48.684 --> 05:50.083
Nobody bothered us.

05:50.886 --> 05:52.547
<i>Well, I'll put out the report.</i>

05:52.922 --> 05:54.856
<i>If you happen to remember
anything else,</i>

05:54.924 --> 05:56.585
however insignificant...

05:58.127 --> 05:59.958
I'll have a car take you home.

06:01.363 --> 06:03.763
I can't just sit at home
and wait.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.926
Call the airline. Tell them
you'll make the turnaround.

06:06.068 --> 06:08.059
<i>No, I can't!
Yes, you can.</i>

06:10.139 --> 06:13.302
It'll take your mind off
of all this. Keep busy.

06:15.077 --> 06:16.806
We'll find her.
I promise.

06:21.016 --> 06:22.881
I'm calling you
the minute I get to LAX.

06:22.952 --> 06:24.249
<i>John, bring the car around</i>

06:24.320 --> 06:25.617
to take Miss Phillips
to the airport.

06:25.688 --> 06:26.677
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

06:30.526 --> 06:31.857
Thank you.

06:33.796 --> 06:35.855
Would you like a soda pop or something?

06:37.766 --> 06:40.200
<i>There's a machine in the
lunchroom. No, thanks.</i>

06:40.903 --> 06:43.838
<i>Bryant, I think Agent Estin wants
you to... I want to stay here.</i>

06:44.006 --> 06:45.530
She's my kid sister.

06:56.485 --> 06:59.010
<i>You already have men out
looking for her, right?</i>

07:00.122 --> 07:01.646
There are people on the case.

07:03.526 --> 07:05.653
<i>Well, what can we do
that we're not doing?</i>

07:05.761 --> 07:07.490
<i>To be perfectly honest with you,</i>

07:07.663 --> 07:09.995
the best thing we can do right now is wait.

07:10.065 --> 07:11.555
<i>Oh, no.
That's not good enough.</i>

07:11.634 --> 07:15.263
The best thing that can happen
right now is a ransom note.

07:15.604 --> 07:16.866
<i>I don't want to alarm you,</i>

07:16.939 --> 07:19.533
but I think you should be
prepared for the realities.

07:19.842 --> 07:22.470
People take children
for all kinds of reasons.

07:22.545 --> 07:24.012
Not all of them are money.

07:31.420 --> 07:34.014
There is one other possibility
we have to consider.

07:34.123 --> 07:35.317
Problems at home.

07:35.391 --> 07:37.791
<i>Maybe Melody'd been misbehaving
lately, and was punished.</i>

07:37.860 --> 07:39.259
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

07:39.528 --> 07:42.725
<i>You're trying to say that she ran
away from home, and that's not it.</i>

07:42.865 --> 07:44.059
So the best thing you can do

07:44.166 --> 07:46.066
is sit at home
and wait for the call.

07:46.268 --> 07:49.101
<i>Here's my number, in case you hear anything.</i>

07:49.171 --> 07:51.230
I'll be in touch with you
if anything turns up.

07:53.275 --> 07:54.742
Oh.

08:03.886 --> 08:08.186
I just thought
I'd seen you somewhere before.

08:08.357 --> 08:11.918
I have that kind of face. I remind
everybody of someone they once knew.

08:12.127 --> 08:14.220
We'll do everything we can.

08:19.902 --> 08:21.199
<i>When I was six years old,</i>

08:21.270 --> 08:24.239
<i>I was convinced that monsters
lived under my bed,</i>

08:24.306 --> 08:27.639
<i>just waiting for nighttime
to come out and grab me.</i>

08:27.977 --> 08:31.777
<i>I laid awake all night for weeks,
on guard against my own fear,</i>

08:31.880 --> 08:36.044
<i>until my dad told me to call the
monsters out and see if they came.</i>

08:36.118 --> 08:37.278
<i>They never did.</i>

08:37.352 --> 08:41.380
<i>Unfortunately, my dad never had
a solution for the real monsters,</i>

08:41.523 --> 08:44.219
<i>the ones that reach out and
grab you in broad daylight,</i>

08:44.460 --> 08:45.586
<i>and neither did I.</i>

08:45.661 --> 08:46.650
<i>Hi,</i>

08:47.162 --> 08:48.151
Son.

08:49.832 --> 08:50.821
Bryant?

08:51.934 --> 08:55.563
<i>Bryant, what happened was not your
fault. I mean, no one's to blame.</i>

08:55.638 --> 08:57.572
<i>Not you, not Donna.</i>

08:57.940 --> 09:00.170
When are you gonna call Mom?

09:00.242 --> 09:03.040
<i>Well, I tried.
There was no answer.</i>

09:03.412 --> 09:04.970
You did hear me?
I heard you.

09:05.147 --> 09:06.808
<i>Look, I never said
it was your fault, okay?</i>

09:06.882 --> 09:09.180
<i>And besides,
you weren't even there.</i>

09:10.185 --> 09:13.882
<i>But I would've been, if your
plane just hadn't beat the clock!</i>

09:17.026 --> 09:19.586
<i>Look, I know how hard it is to
stop worrying about your sister,</i>

09:19.662 --> 09:21.129
<i>even for a minute,</i>

09:22.064 --> 09:25.932
but I just thought
maybe we could shake hands.

09:26.835 --> 09:29.929
<i>Say, "Hi, Son," "Hi, Dad."
Something like that.</i>

09:35.744 --> 09:38.212
We'll find her.
It's a small island.

09:39.014 --> 09:42.711
You can skip the pep talk.
I'm not a little kid anymore.

09:43.285 --> 09:45.412
<i>Characterizing you as a child
would be too charitable.</i>

09:45.754 --> 09:47.187
Even the most undisciplined street urchin

09:47.256 --> 09:50.054
has some sense of respect for
the rights and property of others.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.683
Higgins... But you've gone beyond the bounds

09:51.760 --> 09:53.387
even of personal
irresponsibility

09:53.462 --> 09:55.487
in extending your reprehensible
behavior to your friends.

09:55.564 --> 09:57.122
There's nothing irresponsible
or reprehensible about it.

09:57.199 --> 09:58.996
It isn't enough that you use my every absence

09:59.068 --> 10:00.660
to launch another bacchanal
at the estate...

10:00.736 --> 10:02.431
It was an aloha party
for T.C.'s kids.

10:02.504 --> 10:03.528
That doesn't excuse the fact...

10:03.605 --> 10:06.369
<i>We never had the party, because
his daughter was abducted.</i>

10:06.460 --> 10:08.069
Now receives junk mail
and flyers here...

10:13.615 --> 10:14.604
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

10:16.552 --> 10:18.213
<i>Rick and I have been
at the airport all day,</i>

10:18.287 --> 10:20.414
looking for anybody
who might have seen her.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.286
What junk mail and flyers?

10:23.125 --> 10:25.150
There was a letter
in this afternoon's post

10:25.227 --> 10:27.161
addressed to Theodore Calvin at Robin's Nest.

10:27.229 --> 10:30.221
There was no postmark
and no return address.

10:32.334 --> 10:33.596
Like a ransom note.

10:34.603 --> 10:36.867
That's gotta be the ransom
note. What did you do with it?

10:43.679 --> 10:45.340
You threw it away?

10:47.850 --> 10:48.874
You threw it away!

10:48.951 --> 10:50.543
There's no need to keep
repeating that question.

10:50.619 --> 10:52.587
I was quite angry
at the mess you created.

10:52.654 --> 10:54.053
You threw it away!

11:01.463 --> 11:03.055
It's a kidnapping.

11:04.133 --> 11:06.761
<i>Well, at least that gives
us something to work with.</i>

11:19.097 --> 11:21.827
He finally go to sleep? Looks that way.

11:26.104 --> 11:29.562
<i>Boy, I'd forgotten how hard it
is to explain things to kids.</i>

11:29.707 --> 11:33.040
He doesn't understand why I won't
call Estin about the ransom note.

11:33.111 --> 11:34.601
<i>Well, I'm not sure I do, either.</i>

11:34.679 --> 11:36.647
We can go through
all your papers

11:36.714 --> 11:39.046
<i>and try and find out who
the kidnappers are ourselves,</i>

11:39.183 --> 11:40.810
<i>but T. C.,
Estin's a professional.</i>

11:41.319 --> 11:43.913
<i>He might see something
we're missing. Look, I know.</i>

11:44.522 --> 11:47.013
There's just something
about that guy.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.861
Something I just can't quite...

11:52.130 --> 11:53.119
Okay.

11:54.732 --> 11:59.101
<i>Uh, I sorted it out into strong
possibilities, possibilities, and long shots.</i>

11:59.170 --> 12:01.195
I guess we should start with
the strong possibilities.

12:01.773 --> 12:02.762
Here it is.

12:05.109 --> 12:07.703
I knew I had seen
this guy somewhere.

12:11.316 --> 12:14.114
Estin was the agent in charge.

12:15.019 --> 12:16.919
The kid was only seven.

12:19.257 --> 12:21.384
Why in the world
would you keep this?

12:21.793 --> 12:22.782
Oh...

12:26.197 --> 12:27.630
It was my first
full-page ad...

12:27.699 --> 12:32.534
<i>Look, I don't need
Estin's kind of help.</i>

12:33.338 --> 12:36.034
<i>I will find her myself,</i>

12:36.474 --> 12:37.668
<i>and I'll get her back,</i>

12:37.742 --> 12:38.731
alive.

12:39.611 --> 12:40.703
Okay.

12:42.246 --> 12:43.235
You're the boss.

12:44.749 --> 12:46.649
What keeps bothering me is why.

12:46.718 --> 12:48.208
Why would anybody kidnap Melody?

12:48.319 --> 12:50.685
<i>Come on! They told us why.
$300,000 in twenties.</i>

12:50.955 --> 12:53.822
<i>But you don't have that
kind of cash. Well, not here.</i>

12:56.194 --> 12:57.821
But I can get my hands on it.

12:59.330 --> 13:00.661
If I sold everything.

13:04.102 --> 13:05.967
Maybe got a bank loan.

13:06.137 --> 13:07.229
But who would know that?

13:08.840 --> 13:11.070
And who would know
to contact you at Robin's?

13:13.544 --> 13:14.533
Hello.

13:14.646 --> 13:15.840
<i>T.C.?
Yeah.</i>

13:16.147 --> 13:17.944
<i>I'm afraid you'd better
come to the estate.</i>

13:18.349 --> 13:19.338
<i>Right away.</i>

13:27.525 --> 13:28.787
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

13:29.260 --> 13:30.454
Bryant.

13:33.264 --> 13:37.496
<i>Uh, I tried calling you at home,
Tina, but there was no answer.</i>

13:37.568 --> 13:41.265
That's because Agent Estin didn't
wait as long as you did to call us.

13:45.910 --> 13:46.899
<i>Hello, Thomas.</i>

13:47.478 --> 13:48.467
Tina.

13:49.013 --> 13:50.605
Thomas Magnum.
Tina and I are...

13:50.682 --> 13:52.013
<i>I know, I know.</i>

13:53.618 --> 13:54.744
<i>Hello, son.</i>

13:55.286 --> 13:56.275
Hi.

13:59.290 --> 14:01.451
Perhaps you'd like to talk
in the study.

14:01.759 --> 14:04.922
I think you'll find it
more comfortable in there.

14:05.697 --> 14:07.130
Do you work for T. C?

14:08.666 --> 14:09.655
Hmm?

14:10.234 --> 14:12.202
<i>Oh, no. Um...</i>

14:13.104 --> 14:14.731
Higgins doesn't work for me.

14:16.374 --> 14:18.467
<i>He doesn't own this place, Mom.</i>

14:18.543 --> 14:20.408
He doesn't even have
an estate at all.

14:20.578 --> 14:23.570
<i>Or a guest house, or a private
beach, or tennis courts,</i>

14:23.648 --> 14:24.945
or anything like that.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.049
He doesn't even have a Ferrari.

14:27.652 --> 14:28.812
Just a house.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.450
<i>Look, I never said I actually
owned any of those things.</i>

14:31.556 --> 14:34.354
<i>Forget it, T.C.
I don't want to hear it.</i>

14:36.227 --> 14:37.558
Excuse us.

14:38.563 --> 14:40.656
<i>Listen, can we keep this
in the family?</i>

14:41.299 --> 14:43.893
David can hear anything else
you have to say to me.

14:59.617 --> 15:00.777
We're taking Bryant with us.

15:00.918 --> 15:03.910
<i>No... T. C., my cousin Evelyn
is letting us stay with her.</i>

15:04.922 --> 15:06.890
<i>Please, let him stay with me, like we agreed.</i>

15:07.925 --> 15:09.859
Why don't we let Bryant decide?

15:11.662 --> 15:14.654
<i>Well, I would like
to stay with him.</i>

15:16.234 --> 15:17.633
We have to find Melody.

15:18.436 --> 15:21.030
<i>But honey, that's what the
police are doing right now.</i>

15:21.272 --> 15:23.832
And Agent Estin... They're
working very hard...

15:23.908 --> 15:25.876
You said let him decide.
He decided.

15:25.943 --> 15:28.377
No more debate.
The subject's closed.

15:28.446 --> 15:31.279
<i>Well, I hope you keep a better eye on Bryant.</i>

15:38.189 --> 15:39.850
I think you better go.

15:41.626 --> 15:42.615
Now.

15:50.668 --> 15:52.795
<i>You call me, you hear?
Okay.</i>

15:57.708 --> 15:59.471
<i>Look, I don't have
a lot of money.</i>

15:59.844 --> 16:01.744
We've had business expenses...

16:01.946 --> 16:05.905
<i>Look, don't worry about it. I'll
get the ransom money somehow.</i>

16:21.432 --> 16:24.060
You're welcome to stay.
There's plenty of room.

16:24.602 --> 16:26.092
Thank you. We...

16:27.238 --> 16:29.001
We've made other arrangements.

16:30.241 --> 16:31.572
Very well.

16:47.091 --> 16:49.992
<i>Look, all that stuff
about me owning the estate...</i>

16:50.061 --> 16:52.222
<i>T. C., an explanation
is completely unnecessary.</i>

16:52.296 --> 16:53.285
I'm sorry. I...

16:53.364 --> 16:57.767
It's perfectly understandable that
one might find oneself in a situation

16:57.869 --> 17:00.030
<i>where, well, the truth
becomes a trifle embellished.</i>

17:00.104 --> 17:02.572
<i>Like the time your old buddies
from Sandhurst came here,</i>

17:02.640 --> 17:04.608
and you... There's no
need to go into details.

17:04.742 --> 17:07.175
Let he who has not sinned
cast the first stone.

17:10.114 --> 17:13.345
I shall telephone Switzerland as
soon as banking hours open there.

17:13.550 --> 17:17.385
<i>I believe we should be able to
withdraw $300,000 from Robin's account.</i>

17:17.722 --> 17:20.623
Wouldn't Robin have to authorize
something like that personally?

17:20.691 --> 17:22.886
He's inaccessible at present.

17:25.363 --> 17:28.662
<i>He's with three Swedish models at the
Annapurna Sanctuary in the Himalayas,</i>

17:28.733 --> 17:31.099
photographing a layout
for his new book.

17:31.435 --> 17:34.598
<i>In any event, I have
complete power of attorney.</i>

17:34.672 --> 17:37.641
And I'd like to do
anything I can to help.

17:38.109 --> 17:39.098
We all would.

17:41.646 --> 17:42.635
Thanks.

17:44.448 --> 17:47.884
I'd like to get my son home.
It's been a long day.

17:55.026 --> 17:57.221
<i>No, sir, I will not
be put on hold again.</i>

17:57.295 --> 18:00.856
I have been on bloody hold
since before bloody sunrise!

18:01.699 --> 18:05.328
<i>I do not know what sort of banking
practices you are accustomed to,</i>

18:05.403 --> 18:07.132
<i>but you cannot
just snap your fingers</i>

18:07.204 --> 18:09.934
<i>and expect us to hand over
$300,000 American.</i>

18:10.574 --> 18:12.201
I did not snap my fingers!

18:12.276 --> 18:14.107
<i>I gave you
the proper security codes,</i>

18:14.178 --> 18:16.112
and I expect you to honor them!

18:16.180 --> 18:17.169
<i>Hold, please.</i>

18:29.760 --> 18:30.749
Ice Pick?

18:34.432 --> 18:36.627
<i>I'd have liked
to think I'd been clever</i>

18:36.701 --> 18:40.660
<i>in figuring out why T.C. Assumed
the role of lord of Robin's Nest,</i>

18:40.738 --> 18:44.265
<i>but I think the reason was
clear to anyone who knew him.</i>

18:44.375 --> 18:46.240
<i>He wanted to see his kids,</i>

18:46.310 --> 18:49.643
<i>and he wanted Tina to feel
okay about sending them.</i>

18:50.181 --> 18:55.778
<i>Tina had also assumed a role:
The strong and stoic ex-wife.</i>

18:55.886 --> 18:58.855
<i>Which was pretty understandable,
under the circumstances.</i>

18:59.190 --> 19:01.385
<i>And even though Bryant's role</i>

19:01.459 --> 19:05.259
<i>as the guy who doesn't need anybody
because he had to be the man of the family</i>

19:05.329 --> 19:06.819
<i>was pretty convincing,</i>

19:06.897 --> 19:09.365
<i>I knew his love for his dad
was genuine.</i>

19:19.844 --> 19:20.833
Any progress?

19:22.346 --> 19:23.506
<i>No, nothing yet.</i>

19:24.148 --> 19:25.877
Thomas?

19:26.517 --> 19:27.814
Hi. Can I talk
to you a minute?

19:28.352 --> 19:29.341
Of course.

19:34.725 --> 19:37.023
Excuse me.
Where are you going?

19:37.828 --> 19:40.160
I've got some phone calls
to make.

19:42.133 --> 19:44.829
He's a little uncomfortable
around T.C.'s friends.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.395
My old friends.

19:47.271 --> 19:48.829
Come in. Sit down.

19:51.442 --> 19:52.841
<i>Tina, I have lunch ready...</i>

19:53.310 --> 19:55.175
<i>Evelyn, Thomas Magnum.</i>

19:55.379 --> 19:57.279
<i>Thomas, my cousin, Evelyn Perry.</i>

19:58.149 --> 19:59.138
Hello.
Hi.

20:00.017 --> 20:01.712
I can bring the sandwiches
in here.

20:01.786 --> 20:03.845
<i>Not for me, thanks.
I'm not hungry.</i>

20:05.356 --> 20:07.586
<i>You really must eat
something, Tina.</i>

20:08.559 --> 20:09.753
<i>I will, later.</i>

20:16.967 --> 20:20.300
What a lousy reason to see each
other again after all these years.

20:22.907 --> 20:25.341
I wish I'd kept in touch.
I meant to.

20:28.813 --> 20:31.145
<i>I didn't know
what to say to you, either.</i>

20:36.187 --> 20:38.280
<i>Oh, Thomas, I am so scared.</i>

20:38.989 --> 20:40.149
We'll find her.

20:42.726 --> 20:44.250
<i>When I woke up this morning,</i>

20:44.995 --> 20:48.294
<i>just for a second,
I thought it was '75 again.</i>

20:49.200 --> 20:50.792
<i>T.C. Had just come home,</i>

20:51.836 --> 20:53.269
and all the bad stuff
hadn't started yet.

20:53.337 --> 20:54.895
<i>The nightmares, and the moods...</i>

20:56.107 --> 20:58.974
<i>Why am I talking about this? I mean,
I thought I had it all under control!</i>

20:59.043 --> 21:00.670
I thought I had it behind me.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.241
I never should have let them
come here!

21:03.380 --> 21:05.541
<i>Tina, you couldn't have known. I should have!</i>

21:05.649 --> 21:07.913
I should have done something!

21:10.254 --> 21:12.449
You are not the bad guy here.

21:12.823 --> 21:14.290
And neither is T.C.

21:15.159 --> 21:16.421
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

21:18.229 --> 21:20.561
I've known that for a long time.

21:21.699 --> 21:24.259
I just don't know
how to tell him that.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.510
I know you ain't paying a social visit.

21:37.982 --> 21:40.576
And you damn sure ain't here
to throw some business my way.

21:40.885 --> 21:43.581
Three hundred thousand dollars.

21:43.821 --> 21:45.812
That's almost
the exact same amount

21:45.890 --> 21:46.982
that the courts made you pay me

21:47.191 --> 21:49.386
when you tried to force me
into the ocean last year.

21:49.460 --> 21:52.258
<i>I don't want to talk to you, and I
don't want you anywhere around me.</i>

21:52.396 --> 21:56.833
<i>Until you give me instructions on
where to bring the ransom money, right?</i>

21:57.735 --> 21:59.498
What the hell
are you talking about?

21:59.637 --> 22:02.572
<i>Man, how far would you go to
take my business away from me?</i>

22:02.840 --> 22:05.274
<i>I mean, you couldn't
knock me out of the air,</i>

22:05.342 --> 22:07.640
so is that when you decided
to kidnap my little girl?

22:07.711 --> 22:11.112
<i>Hey! You want to fling around
accusations like that, go ahead.</i>

22:11.215 --> 22:13.376
I'll take you on.
Don't you think I won't!

22:13.450 --> 22:15.042
<i>We can wail on each other
all you want to,</i>

22:15.119 --> 22:17.144
but it ain't gonna
change the truth.

22:17.221 --> 22:19.621
I didn't kidnap
your little girl.

22:20.457 --> 22:22.618
I'd never do
something like that.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.034
I had to find out.

22:31.936 --> 22:33.460
<i>Tell you what, T. C.,</i>

22:34.572 --> 22:36.665
<i>you find yourself having to
sell to raise that ransom money,</i>

22:36.740 --> 22:39.231
I'd be more than wiling
to oblige.

22:39.543 --> 22:40.942
Cash on the barrelhead.

22:41.512 --> 22:43.844
<i>I know I can't pay you
what it's worth,</i>

22:44.215 --> 22:46.149
but I can get the money
pretty fast.

22:51.789 --> 22:52.778
Cash?

22:59.230 --> 23:01.596
I am simply stating
that a computer malfunction

23:01.665 --> 23:04.896
does not prohibit checking my
authorization codes manually.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.569
Nor does it interfere
with a telex wire.

23:07.938 --> 23:09.735
<i>But the computer
is the very reason</i>

23:09.807 --> 23:11.900
<i>we no longer have enough staff
for manual coding.</i>

23:12.009 --> 23:14.000
Then check
the bloody numbers yourself!

23:14.078 --> 23:15.773
<i>There is no need to shout.</i>

23:15.913 --> 23:17.972
<i>There is every need to shout,
Mr. Eberhardt!</i>

23:18.048 --> 23:21.381
I seem to have no other way to convince
you of the urgency of the situation.

23:21.619 --> 23:23.348
A little girl's life may be lost

23:23.454 --> 23:26.685
because of feeble excuses
about computer malfunctions!

23:26.757 --> 23:28.554
<i>Are you quite finished?
No!</i>

23:29.493 --> 23:32.155
But your relationship with Robin
Masters' investment firm will be

23:32.229 --> 23:33.491
if you cannot find a way

23:33.564 --> 23:36.658
to devote your immediate and
undivided attention to this matter!

23:40.404 --> 23:42.031
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

23:42.640 --> 23:44.972
I sincerely hope it's enough!

24:04.595 --> 24:07.587
He's not? Do you know
where he can be reached?

24:07.731 --> 24:09.961
<i>No, just tell him
Bryant Calvin called.</i>

24:11.268 --> 24:13.634
They said Agent Estin
won't be back till tonight.

24:14.338 --> 24:15.498
<i>Hey, T. C.,
we got a lead.</i>

24:15.572 --> 24:16.903
<i>I talked to Ice Pick,
and Thomas here talked...</i>

24:16.974 --> 24:18.100
What's going on?

24:19.009 --> 24:20.636
I'm selling the business.

24:23.514 --> 24:25.709
Higgins is getting nothing
but a bunch of red tape.

24:27.084 --> 24:30.053
<i>The bank say a loan would take 90
days. Well, I ain't got 90 days.</i>

24:30.120 --> 24:33.112
So I'm selling the business
to Big Jim Stotter.

24:33.190 --> 24:35.317
<i>Can I, uh, talk to you a minute?</i>

24:42.066 --> 24:43.533
You may not need the ransom.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.795
I think we may know
who the kidnapper is.

24:46.970 --> 24:49.165
<i>Tina's boyfriend,
David Crawford.</i>

25:01.568 --> 25:05.129
You guys can stop whispering. Melody
and I don't like the guy anyway.

25:08.876 --> 25:11.242
What makes you think David
Crawford's the kidnapper?

25:11.311 --> 25:13.108
Motive and opportunity.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.808
<i>He borrowed about a half a million
dollars to get his business started,</i>

25:15.883 --> 25:17.350
and he's overdue
on a big chunk of it.

25:17.451 --> 25:19.282
<i>Which he must have thought
that you were good for,</i>

25:19.353 --> 25:20.786
<i>because everything
that you told Tina,</i>

25:20.854 --> 25:22.048
she believed to be true.

25:22.456 --> 25:23.787
You talked to Tina?

25:24.124 --> 25:26.354
No. I did.

25:26.426 --> 25:30.522
<i>Whoever took Melody knew how much you
were worth, or at least thought he did.</i>

25:30.597 --> 25:33.225
So I got to wondering
how much Tina told David.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.289
A lot.

25:35.969 --> 25:38.529
She sort of brags about you
to everybody.

25:38.672 --> 25:40.640
About your business
and everything.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.901
<i>I also got to wondering why
he was overdue on the note,</i>

25:45.412 --> 25:47.880
and I had a friend of mine
at the phone company

25:47.948 --> 25:50.940
to make a list of all the
long-distance calls from the Perry house

25:51.018 --> 25:52.042
in the last 24 hours.

25:52.119 --> 25:55.680
This number here? That's a Los Angeles
bookie. He only handles high rollers.

25:56.290 --> 25:57.416
I'm going over there.

25:58.025 --> 26:00.220
Not till we have solid proof.

26:00.561 --> 26:02.461
Where you gonna get that?
Ice Pick.

26:03.196 --> 26:04.823
<i>Well, not Ice Pick himself.</i>

26:05.265 --> 26:06.994
A bookie that he told me about.

26:07.334 --> 26:08.426
Who's Ice Pick?

26:08.635 --> 26:10.933
Who's Ice Pick? Ice Pick's a
friend of mine. He's from Chicago.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.494
But his real name's
not Ice Pick.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.664
<i>Uh, Rick?
Bernie Cochran.</i>

26:15.309 --> 26:17.277
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bernie the Bookie.</i>

26:17.411 --> 26:20.141
Apparently he's making a
pickup for this Mainland guy.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.805
And I know that he's
collecting from Crawford.

26:23.050 --> 26:24.415
We can't wait until then!

26:24.484 --> 26:27.282
We won't have to. Rick's gonna
get Bernie to show him his books.

26:28.522 --> 26:30.183
And how are you gonna do that?

26:33.961 --> 26:34.950
Trust me.

26:35.362 --> 26:36.624
<i>Okay. Well,
let me know.</i>

26:36.697 --> 26:37.686
Yep!

26:39.266 --> 26:41.257
We should call Mr. Estin.
He'll get us proof.

26:41.401 --> 26:43.528
<i>No, we are not calling Estin.</i>

26:43.604 --> 26:44.969
We're going on with our plan

26:45.038 --> 26:47.063
for you to take
your first and last.

26:47.574 --> 26:49.337
Island Hopper ride

26:49.409 --> 26:51.741
when I deliver the chopper
to Big Jim Stotter.

26:51.845 --> 26:54.939
<i>No, thanks. I don't think I want
to go on any helicopter ride.</i>

26:55.048 --> 26:58.211
<i>Look, if you don't want to give
an inch, that's your decision.</i>

26:58.285 --> 26:59.547
That's fine.

27:00.354 --> 27:01.753
<i>But I'm your father,</i>

27:03.256 --> 27:06.623
and I think a son should want to
spend some time with his father.

27:06.727 --> 27:10.128
<i>That way, you decide whether you're
gonna be my friend or my enemy,</i>

27:12.599 --> 27:14.191
at least you'll know
the reason why.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.161
<i>Yeah, well, while we're out
there spending time together,</i>

27:17.237 --> 27:18.568
Melody's out there by herself. Hey!

27:19.039 --> 27:20.370
You think it's easy
for me to sit around

27:20.474 --> 27:22.305
waiting for the next set of instructions?

27:22.376 --> 27:24.105
<i>I don't want to go for
any helicopter ride either,</i>

27:24.177 --> 27:26.509
but what I want is not
important. What is important

27:26.580 --> 27:29.378
is to make sure that
Melody does not get hurt.

27:29.449 --> 27:30.677
You got that?

27:47.067 --> 27:49.695
<i>Oh, hey, bet you guys are here
for the baseball equipment.</i>

27:49.770 --> 27:51.795
I got it all
packed up in the van.

27:52.973 --> 27:55.806
We've been everywhere. We've
looked through every street.

27:57.444 --> 27:58.968
What are you talking about?

27:59.579 --> 28:01.547
Me and the guys. We've
been looking for Melody.

28:03.517 --> 28:06.350
<i>We covered Chinatown,
Little Saigon, Waikiki.</i>

28:07.454 --> 28:09.888
We've been combing
the beaches all morning.

28:10.090 --> 28:12.422
I don't know where else to look.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.096
I'm sorry.
We really let you down.

28:17.297 --> 28:21.256
<i>Oh, no.
Hey, man, thanks.</i>

28:23.603 --> 28:24.865
<i>Sorry, Coach.</i>

28:30.077 --> 28:33.012
<i>Look, I got some
other things to do.</i>

28:33.246 --> 28:35.441
<i>You guys go on
and get the equipment and, uh,</i>

28:35.916 --> 28:36.905
play your game.

28:37.584 --> 28:38.573
But Coach...

28:39.519 --> 28:42.579
Please. That's the best
you can do for me right now.

28:45.492 --> 28:46.584
We'll call you.

28:48.995 --> 28:49.984
After.

29:13.954 --> 29:14.978
T. C!

29:21.862 --> 29:22.851
Dad?

29:26.700 --> 29:30.932
<i>Sometimes I get, I don't
know, worried about stuff,</i>

29:31.538 --> 29:34.632
and I guess I kind of act
like a real jerk.

29:36.810 --> 29:38.107
<i>No, you don't.</i>

29:38.678 --> 29:42.079
You just act like someone who's
trying to do everything for himself.

29:42.449 --> 29:44.883
You don't have
to do that anymore.

29:47.921 --> 29:49.980
I think I'd like
that helicopter ride.

29:50.791 --> 29:52.315
<i>Hey, all right!</i>

29:53.560 --> 29:55.425
I've never been
in a helicopter before.

29:55.495 --> 29:56.860
Sure you have.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.555
You probably don't remember.

29:58.632 --> 30:00.930
I took you and your Momma
when you were just a baby.

30:01.001 --> 30:03.765
<i>Scared her to death,
but you, you just laughed...</i>

30:03.870 --> 30:05.303
I did?
Yeah!

30:06.807 --> 30:08.934
<i>Speaking of laughing, come here.</i>

30:09.543 --> 30:10.532
All right.

30:10.777 --> 30:12.267
Let me ask you something.

30:13.046 --> 30:15.139
Are you still ticklish
on your stomach?

30:16.783 --> 30:17.943
<i>Come on, Dad!</i>

30:18.118 --> 30:21.815
<i>Hey, let me ask you. Have you ever
thought about calling me sometime?</i>

30:30.864 --> 30:31.956
What's wrong?

30:32.299 --> 30:33.391
Nothing.

30:33.466 --> 30:34.626
<i>Well, then I don't have
much time, Higgins.</i>

30:34.701 --> 30:35.725
Big Jim's waiting with the cash.

30:35.802 --> 30:37.702
You no longer need
Big Jim's cash.

30:39.573 --> 30:43.100
And Mr. Masters' donation does not
require the sale of your helicopter.

30:44.411 --> 30:45.400
You got it?

30:45.645 --> 30:48.273
It's locked in the estate
vault at this very moment.

30:48.348 --> 30:49.337
All right!

30:56.323 --> 30:58.018
<i>Addendum to role-playing.</i>

30:58.091 --> 31:00.321
<i>Sometimes it can help you
solve cases.</i>

31:00.694 --> 31:04.630
<i>For instance, I always knew Rick was
capable of playing a variety of roles.</i>

31:07.334 --> 31:11.703
<i>But sometimes it seemed like
he'd watched too many old movies.</i>

31:18.378 --> 31:21.142
Ice Pick never told me
he had a new pencil jockey.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.908
Chrysler tell Detroit every
time they make a change?

31:24.517 --> 31:26.951
He's never interfered
with my business before.

31:27.020 --> 31:29.011
And he's not going to now.

31:29.089 --> 31:32.547
<i>All he needs
is that $300,000 name.</i>

31:34.127 --> 31:37.221
<i>That's strictly against
my procedures, my man.</i>

31:37.664 --> 31:39.393
I'll give Ice Pick the message.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.155
Wait.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.966
<i>Don't get
in a hoo-hoo, bro.</i>

31:45.372 --> 31:48.466
If you can't bend a few rules
between friends...

31:59.352 --> 32:00.944
I can't believe that
anybody would think

32:01.021 --> 32:03.114
<i>that they could get into
a bookie for $300,000</i>

32:03.223 --> 32:04.212
and just walk away.

32:04.324 --> 32:05.723
These guys play for keeps!

32:05.792 --> 32:07.054
I guess amateurs
don't know that.

32:07.127 --> 32:09.095
<i>Yeah, well, I'm gonna cover the back.</i>

32:09.162 --> 32:11.357
<i>Oh, you just want to avoid Tina.</i>

32:11.431 --> 32:13.922
<i>You blame me? She hates my
guts, and she always has.</i>

32:14.000 --> 32:15.058
She doesn't hate you.

32:15.135 --> 32:18.127
She just thinks you were a
bad influence on her husband.

32:18.571 --> 32:19.560
So were you.

32:38.491 --> 32:39.480
<i>Hi, Tina.</i>

32:39.793 --> 32:41.260
Is it Melody?
Did you find her?

32:41.361 --> 32:43.124
No. That's why I'm here.

32:49.502 --> 32:51.595
<i>What do you mean,
"That's why I'm here"?</i>

32:51.771 --> 32:54.296
I figure Melody's kidnapper
can tell us where she is.

32:55.542 --> 32:56.566
Are you...

32:56.843 --> 32:57.935
Are you accusing David...

32:58.011 --> 32:59.000
Where's Evelyn?

33:11.891 --> 33:14.086
<i>Where is she, Evelyn?
Where's Melody?</i>

33:19.132 --> 33:20.656
I don't have her anymore!

33:25.271 --> 33:26.260
They do.

33:36.332 --> 33:38.732
<i>I gambled it all
away, Mr. Estin.</i>

33:39.935 --> 33:42.130
Everything Lloyd and I had.

33:43.005 --> 33:43.994
Everything.

33:47.009 --> 33:48.670
I started borrowing to get more.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.438
And more.

33:52.515 --> 33:55.006
<i>Until finally I owed $300,000.</i>

33:57.586 --> 33:59.383
<i>When they showed up to collect,</i>

34:00.689 --> 34:01.986
I didn't have it.

34:03.559 --> 34:05.117
I didn't know what to do.

34:06.162 --> 34:08.858
Lloyd was going to be
back soon from Guam.

34:10.065 --> 34:11.828
He didn't even know.

34:13.068 --> 34:14.558
<i>I had to do something,</i>

34:15.804 --> 34:17.898
<i>anything, to get that money.</i>

34:20.842 --> 34:22.674
<i>After I took Melody,</i>

34:23.078 --> 34:24.806
<i>they came and took her from me.</i>

34:25.748 --> 34:28.216
<i>They said they didn't need
a middleman.</i>

34:29.451 --> 34:33.012
<i>Now that you know who they
are, maybe you can find her.</i>

34:33.889 --> 34:37.222
<i>It's unlikely that the kidnappers
will let the little girl go free.</i>

34:37.293 --> 34:38.760
<i>Even if they do get their money,</i>

34:38.828 --> 34:41.159
<i>they still can't risk
being identified.</i>

34:42.297 --> 34:43.764
<i>I think that's all for now.</i>

34:44.699 --> 34:47.692
What about the ransom note?
Did he say anything about that?

34:52.908 --> 34:54.569
I didn't tell him about that.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.637
You didn't tell him?

34:56.712 --> 34:57.906
There's a good reason for that.

34:57.980 --> 35:00.244
There couldn't be
a good enough reason!

35:02.551 --> 35:04.075
You haven't changed at all.

35:04.253 --> 35:06.517
You still have to
run the world your own way!

35:09.825 --> 35:10.814
Tina!

35:27.076 --> 35:28.065
Tina!

35:28.811 --> 35:30.904
I don't want to hear it!

35:34.550 --> 35:36.609
<i>Yes, I do. Don't go, T.C.</i>

35:37.086 --> 35:38.075
Please.

35:40.456 --> 35:41.980
What's with us?

35:42.391 --> 35:44.154
Is there some sort of
unwritten rule

35:44.226 --> 35:46.888
that says we have to argue
every time we get together?

35:46.962 --> 35:48.953
Even at a time like this?

35:50.099 --> 35:52.829
I am tired of arguing. I am
tired of living in the past.

35:52.902 --> 35:55.598
I am tired of blaming each
other for what went wrong.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.596
Not everybody gets to
run away from their past.

35:59.141 --> 36:02.577
Escape to a tropical island
and start all over again.

36:02.678 --> 36:05.112
<i>Come on, you act as though I had a choice.</i>

36:05.314 --> 36:07.578
I did what I had to do.

36:08.284 --> 36:09.273
For all of us.

36:10.519 --> 36:11.508
I...

36:16.892 --> 36:18.826
I can't go through this alone.

36:22.564 --> 36:23.997
You're not alone.

36:24.066 --> 36:28.230
<i>But if you want someone to help
you, you're gonna have to trust them.</i>

36:29.071 --> 36:30.060
A little.

36:32.007 --> 36:33.235
I can do that.

36:35.544 --> 36:36.533
Trust me?

36:37.980 --> 36:38.969
A little.

36:39.748 --> 36:41.340
No more arguing?

36:41.450 --> 36:45.352
No more blaming each other.
No more living in the past.

36:46.255 --> 36:47.244
Whew!

36:49.725 --> 36:53.559
I guess we've just
negotiated a cease-fire.

36:55.864 --> 36:57.161
T. C! Phone!

37:14.917 --> 37:16.908
Kapiolani Park at noon.

37:17.086 --> 37:19.577
They said to send somebody
to the Sea Palms Hotel.

37:19.788 --> 37:20.777
Room 401.

37:21.890 --> 37:24.415
<i>These guys
know what they're doing,</i>

37:24.560 --> 37:26.551
and it's gonna take all
of us to beat their setup.

37:30.833 --> 37:34.098
<i>I wish we could use your chopper,
but I'm afraid they'll recognize it.</i>

37:37.172 --> 37:39.265
Not if it's not my chopper.

37:52.955 --> 37:54.855
<i>Big Jim, do you read me?</i>

37:55.891 --> 37:58.553
<i>I read you, T.C.
Loud and clear.</i>

37:59.228 --> 38:02.061
<i>Just let me know
when they make a move.</i>

38:02.598 --> 38:04.031
<i>How about you, Thomas?</i>

38:04.400 --> 38:06.163
<i>You at the Sea Palms Hotel yet?</i>

38:09.671 --> 38:11.400
I'll call you back
when I'm in the room.

38:13.509 --> 38:15.909
<i>$300,000, in twenties.</i>

38:16.378 --> 38:17.402
<i>Thanks, Higgins.</i>

38:17.479 --> 38:19.208
It won't be out of sight for long.

38:20.983 --> 38:24.111
This little baby's gonna get
Robin's 300 G's back safe and sound.

39:33.088 --> 39:34.680
<i>I can see her, T.C.
She looks okay.</i>

39:36.492 --> 39:37.857
<i>Thank God.</i>

39:41.730 --> 39:45.029
<i>And I can see today's paper,
just like they said.</i>

39:45.467 --> 39:46.661
Can you tell where she is?

39:47.503 --> 39:50.199
She could be anywhere. They're still
promising to give us her location.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.337
<i>All right, I'm on my way.</i>

39:53.442 --> 39:54.773
Good luck.

41:09.151 --> 41:10.140
Contact.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.579
I'm reading him.

41:30.305 --> 41:31.329
He doesn't have the bag.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.029
Let's go.

41:46.321 --> 41:47.447
We're leaving the park area.

41:47.522 --> 41:49.422
We're staying close
to the attaché case.

41:50.525 --> 41:51.583
<i>I'm sticking with you.</i>

41:52.694 --> 41:54.685
Still no word
on Melody's location.

42:00.168 --> 42:01.499
<i>I've got him in sight.</i>

42:02.371 --> 42:05.067
Hang back a little.
Don't spook him.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.987
Which car do we follow? It's dealer's choice.

42:27.829 --> 42:31.162
Take the car on the left. We
should stick with the Continental.

42:37.673 --> 42:39.641
<i>Guys, we're losing the signal.</i>

42:40.075 --> 42:41.770
We're following the wrong car!

42:49.418 --> 42:50.407
Yeah?

42:50.585 --> 42:53.554
<i>17501 Aliikoa, Waikiki.</i>

42:58.160 --> 42:59.684
<i>Aliikoa, Waikiki.</i>

43:00.162 --> 43:02.687
<i>17501 Aliikoa.</i>

43:02.764 --> 43:04.698
The other car was moving in that direction.

43:06.234 --> 43:09.203
<i>Go on to Waikiki, T.C. I'll
stay with the money car.</i>

43:22.417 --> 43:25.250
<i>Wait a minute, T.C.
Turn around and come back.</i>

43:25.520 --> 43:28.114
They're trying to draw you
away. She's not in Waikiki.

43:28.190 --> 43:29.316
<i>How do you know?</i>

43:29.391 --> 43:31.825
There's a reflection in a
picture. I can see this hotel.

43:31.893 --> 43:33.485
She's right across the street!

43:34.096 --> 43:35.723
<i>We're on our way.</i>

43:52.447 --> 43:54.938
<i>T.C., I'm gonna try
and cut 'em off.</i>

43:55.117 --> 43:57.517
<i>Go for it, Big Jim.
We'll back you up.</i>

44:09.364 --> 44:11.594
<i>It's high time
we did business our way.</i>

44:53.475 --> 44:54.464
Yeah!

44:55.677 --> 44:56.666
T. C!

45:05.954 --> 45:07.421
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

45:17.399 --> 45:18.593
You all right?

45:19.100 --> 45:20.397
You all right?
Yes.

45:22.070 --> 45:23.059
Yes.

45:23.171 --> 45:24.160
Yeah!

45:24.840 --> 45:25.829
Yeah!

45:27.776 --> 45:28.765
Yeah!

45:32.614 --> 45:33.740
<i>Thanks, Jim.</i>

45:34.516 --> 45:35.778
<i>About the car, Higgins,</i>

45:35.984 --> 45:38.817
I'm sure Robin will understand
when you explain it to him.

45:41.990 --> 45:44.959
<i>It's early, but I'm going
home to have a drink.</i>

45:46.061 --> 45:48.928
The sun has got to be setting
somewhere in the world.

45:53.502 --> 45:55.800
<i>Can I ask you
a question, Thomas?</i>

45:55.871 --> 45:56.963
Sure.

45:57.172 --> 45:59.231
Where did you guys
get all that spy stuff?

45:59.374 --> 46:01.899
<i>Those radios,
and that radar thing?</i>

46:03.512 --> 46:06.640
<i>Well, Robin Masters
is a man of many tastes,</i>

46:06.715 --> 46:08.182
and even more toys.

46:09.217 --> 46:10.206
<i>Look, uh,</i>

46:11.419 --> 46:14.149
I'm sorry I jumped to the
wrong conclusions about David.

46:14.222 --> 46:16.554
You don't have to
say another word.

46:16.791 --> 46:18.520
<i>David and I, well...</i>

46:18.960 --> 46:20.188
He's gone home.

46:20.729 --> 46:23.357
Said he'd be all moved out
by the time I got back.

46:24.666 --> 46:27.430
I think I always knew we
weren't going to be permanent.

46:28.270 --> 46:30.602
