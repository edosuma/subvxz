WEBVTT

00:01.208 --> 00:03.625
I'm almost done packing up
all of Alex's stuff,

00:03.625 --> 00:06.166
so we should have no trouble
moving her out of here.

00:06.166 --> 00:08.458
Justin, she hasn't even
found a place to live yet.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.625
Details, details, Dad.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.500
The fact is,
she is moving out.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.000
And whether that means today,
or later today,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.291
or early this evening,
I'm gonna be ready for it.

00:18.708 --> 00:21.583
Oh, Jerry, look
at all this stuff.

00:21.583 --> 00:25.416
Aw, that's Alex's Good Manners
ribbon from first grade.

00:25.416 --> 00:30.291
I remember when she threw
erasers at her teacher
until he gave her that.

00:30.291 --> 00:33.333
Hey, Ma, look what I found.
It's my ostrich nest.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.583
Ugh, it's disgusting,
get rid of it.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.875
Hey, Mom. First of all,
this is where I do my homework.

00:40.833 --> 00:43.000
And second of all...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.750
I don't know why I
just said "second of all."

00:44.750 --> 00:47.000
I hear people
say that sometimes.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Get rid of it, honey,
and while you're at it,

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
get rid of all the other junk
you've got stored in your room.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.333
How come you guys never
get excited when I show you
something cool?

00:55.333 --> 00:57.500
I mean, even the garbage man
says, "Hey, that's cool,"

00:57.500 --> 00:58.708
before he throws it
in the truck.

01:02.291 --> 01:04.291
Hey, look who's home!

01:04.291 --> 01:06.708
How did the apartment
hunting go? Huh? Any luck?

01:06.708 --> 01:10.250
No pressure, but there's
a moving truck coming
in 15 minutes.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.333
We didn't find anything.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.458
I don't know if
you people realize this,

01:14.458 --> 01:16.750
but finding a cheap
and spacious place to live

01:16.750 --> 01:19.375
in the heart of New York City
is not as easy as it sounds.

01:19.375 --> 01:22.416
Yeah, and it turns out,
when they say an apartment
has "old world charm,"

01:22.416 --> 01:24.708
that means it smells
like boiling cabbage.

01:24.708 --> 01:26.833
Yeah, and when they say,
"light and airy,"

01:26.833 --> 01:28.416
that means there's
a hole in the roof.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.458
Oh, yeah, and don't even
get me started on "quaint."

01:30.458 --> 01:32.125
That means one of us has
to sleep in the bathtub.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.583
- I...
- I already told you no.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.125
Honey, if everybody
advertised the truth,

01:37.125 --> 01:42.208
then we'd have to call
our ham and cheese,
"something and something else."

01:42.208 --> 01:46.000
I thought that finding
a new place would be
a fresh start for me.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.166
Something to get my mind
off my breakup with Mason,

01:48.166 --> 01:50.750
but I guess it's not
really meant to be.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.875
Oh, my gosh.
It's an ad for an apartment.

02:02.875 --> 02:06.291
It's what we've been
looking for, and it's
totally within our price range.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.750
- Come on, Harper!
- Yes! Run, you two!

02:08.750 --> 02:12.291
Run like the wind to catch
your dreams and don't stop
until you get 'em!

02:12.291 --> 02:15.458
And if your dreams aren't there,
then just keep on running!

02:15.458 --> 02:18.291
Whatever you do,
don't come back!

03:16.208 --> 03:19.875
I know. Just blow me up
a mattress, and I'll
sleep in the lobby!

03:19.875 --> 03:21.166
- Well...
- No.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.583
Hello, ladies. Welcome
to the Windsor Apartments.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.166
My name is Dexter
Qweezenberry, XXVII.

03:32.166 --> 03:35.000
Named after my father.
And his father before him.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.375
- And his father before...
- Are you really gonna
do that 27 times?

03:38.375 --> 03:40.625
Not anymore.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
We're here about
the apartment for rent.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh, the flyer.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.583
Come right this way.

03:51.291 --> 03:54.958
I think you're looking
for the 13th floor.

03:54.958 --> 03:57.458
But there is
no 13th floor.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.625
Or is there?

03:59.625 --> 04:02.500
Uh, no, there's not.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.625
Oh, darn it. I could
never do anything dramatic.

04:05.625 --> 04:09.000
There it is.
Let's just go up.

04:18.958 --> 04:22.625
When I saw that you
had the flyer, I knew
you had to be magical.

04:22.625 --> 04:26.458
This secret floor is available
only to wizard world tenants.

04:26.458 --> 04:30.125
- I manage it.
- I never knew these existed.

04:30.125 --> 04:34.125
I know. And there are probably
no rats here because that
lady's snake hair eats them.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.875
So that's a good thing.

04:35.875 --> 04:39.333
Oh, a Christmas elf
in the off-season.

04:40.333 --> 04:44.000
Trash hands. Fancy.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.333
There are hands all over
this floor to help you
with your daily deeds.

04:47.333 --> 04:51.000
Ah, here it is.
Apartment 13B.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.708
These doors all have
combination knocks. Watch.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.208
Four.

04:57.208 --> 04:58.458
Two.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.583
Three.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.458
Ta-da!

05:06.250 --> 05:09.000
Oh, my goodness,
a real floor!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.375
Oh, my goodness,
a real window!

05:12.500 --> 05:15.333
Yeah, I currently live
in a basement, so...

05:16.958 --> 05:20.458
As you can see, this apartment
has many wonderful amenities,

05:20.458 --> 05:22.958
like this beautiful view.

05:22.958 --> 05:27.000
Ah, of another building's
rusty, old fire escape.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.291
Pretend you didn't see that.
You can choose your own view.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.375
A beach.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.625
A volcano.

05:41.083 --> 05:43.333
My Wiztech graduation.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.125
Go Fighting Trolls.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.583
- Go.
- Yeah.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.291
Oh, does this fireplace work?

05:51.291 --> 05:55.083
Yeah, but not so good.
Our dragon has a cold.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.458
Franklin?

05:59.875 --> 06:02.875
It's OK. We'll just
wear sweaters.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.708
So, what do you think, ladies?

06:06.875 --> 06:09.250
- We'll take it.
- Perfect.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.458
Like I said, as long as you're
both wizards, it's all yours.

06:12.458 --> 06:16.250
- Uh, yeah, about that...
- Yeah.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.416
- We're both wizards.
- Then it's settled.

06:19.416 --> 06:23.000
Welcome to the 13th floor
of the Windsor Apartments!

06:25.000 --> 06:27.250
You know, when we
were little girls,

06:27.250 --> 06:29.750
we would hold hands and jump up
and down to celebrate.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.583
But we're women now, so...

06:34.083 --> 06:35.458
Mm-hm.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.583
- We did it!
- We got an apartment!

06:40.875 --> 06:42.875
We're gonna live together!

06:50.250 --> 06:53.125
This is what we're talking
about, this kind of junk, Max!

06:53.125 --> 06:55.625
My reggae banana
is not junk.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.083
Look what it says
on the back.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.958
"Eat your potassium, mon."

06:59.958 --> 07:01.250
That's good advice.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.708
Give it to the garbage "mon."

07:06.125 --> 07:09.750
Everybody, good news.
We found an apartment!

07:14.291 --> 07:15.875
Did you just say you
found an apartment?

07:15.875 --> 07:18.166
Yeah, and that's
not even the best part.

07:18.166 --> 07:21.500
It's a secret wizard apartment
on a secret 13th floor.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.291
- Yes!
- A secret wizard apartment?

07:24.291 --> 07:26.583
I used to
live in one of those.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.708
Man, I had some
wild times in there.

07:28.708 --> 07:32.958
One night, I was in a hot tub
with a Pegasus and there was
all these...

07:33.708 --> 07:35.166
Congratulations, honey.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.708
I know about the Pegasus, Jerry.
And I'm not jealous.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.125
Talk about a horse face.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.875
The only problem is
the apartment has this
"wizards only" policy,

07:45.875 --> 07:47.458
which makes me
kind of nervous.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.708
Well, you can't let a little
thing like that stop you.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.875
Ah, here. This'll make you
look like a wizard.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.166
It's Alex's training wand.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.375
It has one simple function
so you can practice magic

07:59.375 --> 08:01.958
even when you don't have magic.
This one opens things.

08:01.958 --> 08:03.833
Just point it at the object
you want to open,

08:03.833 --> 08:06.458
say "open," and it'll open.

08:06.458 --> 08:10.000
OK, um... Open pretzels.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.250
Oh, no, no, no, this is
too much power for one person.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.958
- Harper, relax!
- OK.

08:20.958 --> 08:25.291
Alex, since you're moving out
and everything,

08:25.291 --> 08:27.958
I decided to give you
a housewarming present.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.208
Thanks.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.125
Doesn't seem like you're
taking it that hard.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.458
Oh, you're right.
Well, what about now?

08:34.458 --> 08:39.000
Alex! Alex, I'm
taking this so hard that
you're leaving! I...

08:40.000 --> 08:41.583
- Better?
- Much better.

08:51.083 --> 08:55.375
OK, that's the last of it,
I guess.

08:55.375 --> 08:58.583
Yep. Certainly...

08:58.583 --> 09:00.875
...appears that way!

09:03.625 --> 09:06.708
Mr. and Mrs. Russo,
are you guys OK?

09:06.708 --> 09:08.708
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.375
It's just hard.

09:11.375 --> 09:16.416
Oh! I mean, our second favorite
child is leaving home.

09:19.583 --> 09:23.750
Yep, I agree, you guys.
It's all very, very sad.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.750
Well, we'd better give them
their space. Everyone out!

09:30.208 --> 09:31.875
See you guys at Christmas.

09:33.583 --> 09:37.416
Oh, honey. We're really
gonna miss you. Oh...

09:37.416 --> 09:40.125
Now remember,
if you need anything...

09:40.125 --> 09:41.875
...just call us, OK?

09:41.875 --> 09:45.500
OK. Don't worry.
I'm ready for this.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.708
I really think that the best
thing for me right now

09:47.708 --> 09:50.250
is to be on my own.

09:50.250 --> 09:54.625
Yeah. Two gals living
totally independent lives
in the big city.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.875
Just me and my best friend,
free of all the baggage
from my past.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.708
Alex?

10:06.375 --> 10:09.458
Mason? What are you
doing here?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.583
I live here.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.333
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.625
I can't believe it, Alex.
This must be a sign.

10:21.625 --> 10:23.291
We're supposed to get
back together.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.125
This is not a sign, Mason.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.083
Think about it. What are the
chances we'd both be looking for
an apartment,

10:28.083 --> 10:30.000
and we'd both randomly
find the same flyer,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.833
and that flyer would lead us
both to the same secret,
magical floor of this building?

10:33.833 --> 10:37.291
Well, when he puts it like that,
it does sound like a sign.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.333
Yeah, go unpack something.

10:42.458 --> 10:47.708
Look, Mason, I moved out
with Harper so that we could
be independent.

10:47.708 --> 10:50.708
Sorry, but a boyfriend
doesn't really fit into
that plan right now.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.583
OK. If that's how you feel,
then I'll respect your wishes.

10:55.583 --> 10:58.708
I look forward to exchanging
meaningless pleasantries
with you

10:58.708 --> 11:00.375
when we pass each other
in the hallway.

11:01.875 --> 11:03.291
Nice earrings.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.458
I can't believe this, Harper.

11:09.458 --> 11:12.250
I'm living in a new place
with my best friend,

11:12.250 --> 11:14.750
and the first neighbor I meet
is my ex-boyfriend.

11:14.750 --> 11:17.458
So you know what you need to do
to take your mind off of him?

11:17.458 --> 11:19.958
We haven't met
the rest of our neighbors.

11:19.958 --> 11:22.333
We should have
a housewarming party.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, you're right.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.583
What better way to kick off
our new, independent lives

11:27.583 --> 11:28.875
than by throwing a party?

11:28.875 --> 11:31.500
See? You've already stopped
thinking about Mason.

11:34.416 --> 11:36.375
Excuse me, Alex.

11:36.375 --> 11:37.875
It's me, Mason.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.458
I went ahead and
picked up your mail.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.416
I have mail already?

11:45.416 --> 11:48.291
Well, actually, it's a letter
I wrote. Nothing special.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.875
Just a stream-of-consciousness
outpouring of my most vulnerable
thoughts and wishes.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.583
Nice weather we're having today.

12:06.875 --> 12:10.291
Guys, since we have all this
great new time on our hands,

12:10.291 --> 12:12.458
I took the liberty of
creating an itinerary

12:12.458 --> 12:16.458
full of events, filling
our evening full of
Alex-free activities.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.166
Uh... Justin, we're
kind of enjoying

12:20.166 --> 12:21.375
our peace and quiet right now.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.083
Dad, if you had read
the itinerary, you'd see

12:24.083 --> 12:25.833
that there's a scheduled
peace and quiet break

12:25.833 --> 12:28.416
right after we share stories
about how we don't miss Alex.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.250
- We've gotta get him
out of here.
- I've got it.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.875
Oh, my goodness,
will you look at this?

12:37.875 --> 12:40.416
Alex left her magazine here!

12:41.708 --> 12:44.291
Oh, too bad there's no way
of getting it to her.

12:44.291 --> 12:48.708
Yeah, it's just gonna
sit there and bug us!

12:48.708 --> 12:52.500
Ugh! Nothing we can
do about it!

12:52.500 --> 12:54.458
Oh... Nothing!

12:55.833 --> 12:58.000
All right...

12:58.000 --> 13:00.750
I guess I'll have to be
the one to take it to her.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.625
I'll do it, but this
is the last time

13:02.625 --> 13:04.500
I let her ruin our
new lives without her.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.166
The last time!

13:10.708 --> 13:12.333
He totally misses her.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.125
I do not miss her!

13:26.458 --> 13:30.958
Come on in. Welcome to the party
thrown by the cool girls
of Apartment 13B.

13:30.958 --> 13:33.416
The "B" stands for "best party
on this floor." OK.

13:33.416 --> 13:36.166
- Alex?
- Felix?

13:36.166 --> 13:38.000
Don't tell me
you live here, too.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.708
- I live here, too!
- This is so crazy.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.833
Wait, did you bring your wand?
Let's see it.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.750
Well, I don't like
to show it off, but...

13:44.750 --> 13:49.583
Behold the most powerful wand
in the Wizard World!

13:49.583 --> 13:52.583
Cheers, Alex.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.458
You look smashing tonight.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.291
Eh? "Smashing?"

13:56.291 --> 14:00.500
I remember how you used to love
my cute British vernacular.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.583
Listen, Mason...

14:01.583 --> 14:04.000
Dodgy, quid, knickers...

14:04.875 --> 14:06.375
Bob's your uncle.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.000
What? Mason,
you have to stop.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.166
Why can't you just
open your heart to me?

14:12.166 --> 14:14.333
Because I don't want
a boyfriend right now.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
Very well. Then you won't
hear another pip, pip

14:17.500 --> 14:18.958
out of this mush.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.125
Nothing?

14:27.083 --> 14:32.250
Hey, Alex. I brought you my
collection of oil-on-canvas
Julia Roberts paintings.

14:32.250 --> 14:36.583
- Really?
- What? She's America's
sweetheart.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.625
All right, I'm just gonna
put this with the rest
of my stuff...

14:38.625 --> 14:40.208
...that I gave you.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.375
Attention, everyone!

14:45.375 --> 14:49.416
If you need your drinks opened,
just ask me and I'll do it
with magic.

14:49.416 --> 14:54.708
Because I can.
Which is why it's OK
for me to live here.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.583
So, yeah. Open bottles.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.375
Yeah.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.708
Harper, what are you doing?

15:05.708 --> 15:07.875
Magic.
What else would I be doing?

15:07.875 --> 15:10.583
You know me.
Always doing magic.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.708
Yeah, it's a training wand.
It has one power.

15:12.708 --> 15:15.000
It opens things.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.375
What? Don't mess with the view.
It matches my outfit. No!

15:25.875 --> 15:28.083
Open Alex's heart.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.291
Oh, hi.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.000
What's your name?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Ogre Moloney.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.416
Oh, wow, that's
a really cool name.

15:45.416 --> 15:46.875
I'm Alex.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.833
- Uh, pardon me, Alex.
- Not now, Mason.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.375
I'm about to open up
my heart to Ogre Moloney.

15:56.708 --> 15:58.708
I... I don't know
what it is about you,

15:58.708 --> 16:01.333
but I can't seem
to get you out of my mind.

16:01.333 --> 16:05.708
Yeah? My hideous face and
relentless cheese stench

16:05.708 --> 16:08.125
sometimes have
that effect on people.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.833
Oh, stop it.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.875
Oh, Ogre Moloney.
You're so funny.

16:21.875 --> 16:26.458
And you just have the cutest
little warts all over your face.

16:26.458 --> 16:29.250
I've got to admit, most
of the girls I've dated

16:29.250 --> 16:31.083
aren't as symmetrical as you.

16:31.083 --> 16:34.625
- Well...
- This is very exciting!

16:36.625 --> 16:40.333
Let's try this again.
Open Alex's heart.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.875
Alex, Alex, over here!
Look quickly!

16:43.875 --> 16:45.708
Hey, Alex.
What's goin' on?

16:45.708 --> 16:48.375
You and me are goin' on.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.958
I feel like I can
tell you anything.

16:52.958 --> 16:55.458
Oh, my gosh.
It's finally happening.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.375
Excuse me.

16:57.375 --> 17:00.000
What do you think you're doing,
talking to my woman?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.291
I hate to break it to you, pal,

17:02.291 --> 17:04.583
but this woman's had a thing
for me for a very long time

17:04.583 --> 17:06.458
and has recently had
the courage to admit it.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.458
Even though you are
big and brutish,

17:10.458 --> 17:15.125
I happen to know for
a fact she prefers men
with freakishly bad posture.

17:16.833 --> 17:20.083
Guys, guys, you
don't need to fight!

17:20.083 --> 17:23.000
My heart is big enough
for both of you.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.875
Mason, what are you doing?

17:28.875 --> 17:30.750
I'm trying to get Alex
to open her heart to me.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.375
What? No, just
give me that!

17:32.375 --> 17:34.500
I'm the only one who gets to
open things with that thing!

17:34.500 --> 17:36.166
Give it! Just give it!

17:36.166 --> 17:37.875
It would be a lot easier
if you just give it to me!

17:41.250 --> 17:42.625
Alex!

17:42.625 --> 17:44.458
Got you some more
housewarming gifts!

17:44.458 --> 17:46.166
- Gimme!
- No, just let go of it!

17:47.875 --> 17:51.333
We're free!

17:51.333 --> 17:53.583
Well, I guess that
ruined the surprise.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.583
It's a box
of screaming banshees.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.958
Enjoy.

17:56.958 --> 17:59.000
Party!

18:01.083 --> 18:02.708
Alex, I brought
you your magazine,

18:02.708 --> 18:03.875
and I hope this
teaches you a lesson...

18:03.875 --> 18:05.708
You're having a
screaming banshee party?

18:05.708 --> 18:06.833
I've heard about these.

18:06.833 --> 18:09.291
No, you have not.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.083
Justin, you've
got to do something.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.750
Max released all these
screaming banshees

18:13.750 --> 18:16.958
and Mason used my training
wand to make Alex fall
in love with everyone.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.708
Say no more, Harper.
I'm on it.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.708
Fanshee, schmansee,
get rid of the banshee.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.875
- How'd you do that?
- Child safety lock.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.250
Everything's back to normal.

18:35.416 --> 18:37.416
Oh, so which one are you
going out with, Alex?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.458
Me or this ogre?

18:39.458 --> 18:42.250
What?! I'm not going out
with either of you.

18:42.250 --> 18:46.583
Yeah, I didn't think
it was gonna last.

18:46.583 --> 18:50.250
- Wanna hang out?
- Sure.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.833
But first we gotta
hose you down.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.583
OK. It's not gonna work.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.416
What's going on here?

18:58.416 --> 19:00.750
Mason used my wand
on your heart.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.083
And I stepped in
and fixed everything.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.583
I realize now why I felt so
weird about you being gone.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.625
It's because cleaning up
other people's messes

19:08.625 --> 19:10.750
and then being able to silently
judge them afterwards

19:10.750 --> 19:12.750
is what makes my life complete.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.583
Did you just say I make
your life complete?

19:18.583 --> 19:19.875
No.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.500
Oh, my gosh. You miss me!

19:24.500 --> 19:27.583
No, I don't
miss you!

19:27.583 --> 19:29.458
Here, take your magazine.
It's the only reason
I came here.

19:29.458 --> 19:33.250
- Bye!
- I miss you, too!

19:36.125 --> 19:38.333
Alex, I'm sorry
I ruined your party,

19:38.333 --> 19:40.958
but I can't apologize
for my feelings.

19:40.958 --> 19:43.208
I let you go way too easily
the last time,

19:43.208 --> 19:46.875
and I won't let it happen again.
I'm not giving up on us.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.708
Mason, please.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.083
All right, then.

19:56.958 --> 19:58.416
The artichoke dip
was delightful.

20:00.708 --> 20:04.625
Alex? Harper? Why am I
receiving complaints

20:04.625 --> 20:06.875
about the new residents
throwing a party?

20:06.875 --> 20:08.708
I'm so, so sorry, Dexter.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.416
It won't happen again,
I promise.

20:10.416 --> 20:12.750
I should hope not.
Parties aren't allowed.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.500
Also, you didn't invite me.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.750
And I'm always the
life of the party.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.083
I do the Dougie...

20:20.083 --> 20:22.250
Lean and brush!
Lean and brush!

20:22.250 --> 20:24.708
Do the Dougie!
Do the Dougie!

20:24.708 --> 20:25.875
Your loss.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.958
Well, that wasn't
exactly how I imagined

20:56.958 --> 20:58.708
our first day in our
new place going.

20:58.708 --> 21:01.416
No, but we're not
focusing on the past, remember?

21:01.416 --> 21:03.458
Things can only get
better from here on out.

21:03.458 --> 21:06.958
Right. Let's go to bed.
I'll take the couch.

21:06.958 --> 21:10.500
Wow, things are
already getting better.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.750
Of course.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.166
Well, good night, Harper.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.458
Good night, Alex.
Good night, Franklin.

21:22.458 --> 21:26.000
Good night, Franklin.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.583
Good night,
Alex, Harper and Franklin.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.958
What?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.708
Max?

21:33.708 --> 21:35.250
What are you doing here?

21:35.250 --> 21:38.208
Alex, I figured since my stuff
is already in your apartment,

21:38.208 --> 21:39.833
I might as well just
live with you guys.

21:39.833 --> 21:42.250
- What do you say?
- Get out!

21:42.250 --> 21:44.833
Fine. I'll just see
my stuff tomorrow.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.708
Hello, Max.

21:59.958 --> 22:01.208
Do I...
Do I know you?

22:01.208 --> 22:02.625
Well, that doesn't matter.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.208
I know you.

22:04.208 --> 22:06.583
And you seem like
someone who would enjoy

22:06.583 --> 22:09.708
going to a very
special wizard camp.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.583
Canoeing, archery...

22:14.583 --> 22:16.458
Cotton candy?

22:16.458 --> 22:17.708
Yeah, this sounds like fun.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.125
I can't wait to run home
and tell my parents.

22:19.125 --> 22:21.833
Oh, make sure to tell
your dad it's free.

22:21.833 --> 22:24.583
- Oh, he'll like that.
- Come on!

22:27.166 --> 22:28.750
Going down?
