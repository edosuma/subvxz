JAKE: Sounds complicated.

15:43.132 --> 15:46.341
Mm. Well, it's complex.

15:47.382 --> 15:51.425
But it's also unexpected.
It has a lot of humor in it, too.

15:52.882 --> 15:53.925

15:59.465 --> 16:01.883
Good. You're already eating.

- BRIAN: How was it?

16:07.048 --> 16:09.591
KATHY: Fine. She's doing good.

16:11.465 --> 16:13.174
The problem now is her husband.

16:16.382 --> 16:19.174
The last thing I want to do
right now is talk about work.

16:19.465 --> 16:21.174
I was telling Jake about the new play.

16:21.382 --> 16:22.716
I'm starving.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.424
JAKE: I thought you weren't working
with the train anymore.

16:26.132 --> 16:27.758
I thought you were gonna do Broadway now.

16:28.882 --> 16:30.133
It's not that simple.

16:30.632 --> 16:33.424
You said you weren't doing
this non-profit stuff.

16:33.882 --> 16:36.841
That the strategy was
to reach a wider audience.

16:37.048 --> 16:38.258
Things have changed.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.633
You should applaud your father
for being adaptable.

16:41.007 --> 16:42.174
It's what life's all about.

- Why can't you?

18:12.215 --> 18:14.258
(IN SPANISH)
You haven't said hello, Mister.

18:14.965 --> 18:16.299
- Hello, Hernán.
- <i>Hola.</i>

18:16.548 --> 18:19.424
That's my friend Jacob Jardine,
but we call him Jake.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.258
- Hello there, Jake.
- Hi.

18:23.132 --> 18:26.633
- Jake, Hernán.
- So you're the grandson?

18:28.298 --> 18:30.716
Yes, Max was his grandfather,

18:31.048 --> 18:33.924
and his father is Brian Jardine.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.591
(IN SPANISH)
The one I was telling you about.

18:37.007 --> 18:39.258
Yeah, he's an actor.
And my mom's a psychotherapist.

18:39.465 --> 18:42.716
HERNÁN: Huh. So how are you enjoying
Brooklyn so far?

18:43.298 --> 18:45.508
JAKE: I like it a lot. Yeah, it's...

18:45.965 --> 18:49.966
It's a lot more peaceful than Manhattan,
and we have much more space. It's great.

18:51.340 --> 18:54.091
So are you going to be an actor?
Like your father?

18:54.340 --> 18:55.341
JAKE: I don't know.

18:56.382 --> 18:57.966
HERNÁN: Well, you look like an artist.

18:58.965 --> 19:00.508
The long hair, everything.

19:01.048 --> 19:02.049
Maybe.

19:02.965 --> 19:06.091
He'll tell us more later,
right, Jake? Go ahead.

19:06.298 --> 19:08.174
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.041

19:24.382 --> 19:26.341
(VIDEO GAME SOUNDS)

19:26.632 --> 19:29.132
Hey, your dad any good at acting?

19:30.173 --> 19:31.632
I don't know. Maybe.

19:32.298 --> 19:34.966
I thought if he was, he maybe
could gimme a couple pointers,

19:35.215 --> 19:36.924
'cause I wanna be an actor when I grow up.

19:38.006 --> 19:39.757
Oh, sure, yeah, I guess.

19:40.298 --> 19:42.591
He's not that successful or anything.

19:44.298 --> 19:47.341
My dream is to go to LaGuardia
High School for Performing Arts.

19:47.631 --> 19:48.716
You heard of that school?

19:50.215 --> 19:52.174
Well, you know, Nicki Minaj went there...

19:53.340 --> 19:56.007
Al Pacino, but he flunked out, so...

19:57.965 --> 20:00.382
Yeah, I think my dad applied there.

20:01.048 --> 20:03.466
Oh, really? Well, it's my dream school.

20:04.215 --> 20:08.257
I've been looking around for some theater
classes, you know, been practicing on my own.

20:08.715 --> 20:10.466
Gonna audition next year
for the ninth grade.

20:12.881 --> 20:14.966
It's gonna be a lot of work
and a lot of practice.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.591
I might need a partner, okay?

20:17.006 --> 20:19.507
- But I'm not an actor.
- That's okay, can you read?

20:20.548 --> 20:22.091
These are some of the scripts
I'm working on.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.341
Like <i>Ah, Wilderness!</i> and <i>Pariah</i>
by August Strindberg.

20:26.548 --> 20:29.174
It's perfect for us to work on,
'cause it's just two guys.

20:31.340 --> 20:35.174
You know what? Focus on your art more,
maybe we could both go to LaGuardia together.

20:35.381 --> 20:36.591
Wouldn't that be great?

20:39.215 --> 20:42.341
- I guess I can try.
- That's the spirit.

20:47.131 --> 20:50.841
- Is Hernán your mom's boyfriend?
- That's disgusting, no!

20:51.215 --> 20:52.507
He's a friend from Chile.

20:53.881 --> 20:58.091
My parents are married.
They just don't live together.

20:59.131 --> 21:01.257
- I don't understand.
- (SCOFFS) Me neither.

21:02.465 --> 21:05.674
My dad travels a lot.
He's a nurse who works for the UN.

21:06.173 --> 21:07.091
Where is he now?

21:07.340 --> 21:09.132
TONY: He's in Angola, it's in Africa.

21:10.048 --> 21:11.174
Look what he sent me.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.424
JAKE: Do you miss having him around more?

21:17.048 --> 21:21.591
I used to. But it's been a while now,
so I've gotten used to it.

21:22.006 --> 21:25.507
Yeah, sometimes my dad goes away
if he's shooting a movie.

21:26.048 --> 21:28.424
But it hasn't really happened in a while.

21:28.881 --> 21:29.841
TONY: Found it.

21:31.548 --> 21:34.632
My dad said he's gonna take me on safari,
and these are the animals we're gonna see.

21:36.465 --> 21:37.716
That's really cool.

21:40.381 --> 21:42.007
Do you wish they still lived together?

21:42.631 --> 21:45.507
I used to. When my dad comes,
he'll cook porchetta.

21:45.715 --> 21:47.174
It's like a roast pork butt.

21:48.048 --> 21:49.466
That's... (LAUGHS)

21:49.881 --> 21:51.341
- It's good.
- That's disgusting.

21:51.548 --> 21:55.007
It's good. We sit at the table,
you know, just the three of us,

21:55.215 --> 21:57.716
and my dad will tell us
about people he met,

21:58.006 --> 22:00.674
places he's been,
and stories about Africa.

22:01.298 --> 22:03.174
We seem like a normal family, and then...

22:03.381 --> 22:04.716
(CLICKS FINGERS) Boom.

22:05.131 --> 22:07.424
They start fighting about
something stupid, like always.

22:08.298 --> 22:09.424
And...

22:10.506 --> 22:12.591
I realize it's better
when he's not around.

22:14.381 --> 22:17.799
JAKE: Imagine if your mom
went with you on the safari,

22:18.548 --> 22:20.507
and they ended up falling in love again.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.007
There's a very little chance
of that happening.

22:23.215 --> 22:26.591
JAKE: But just imagine.
You get an envelope one day.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.591
You open it, and it's
two tickets to a safari.

22:31.048 --> 22:32.716
One for you and one for your mom.

22:33.173 --> 22:37.591
And she decides to go because
she feels like she needs a vacation.

22:38.631 --> 22:42.091
So when you get to Africa,
your dad picks you up at the airport,

22:42.715 --> 22:45.007
and takes you to this incredible place,

22:45.298 --> 22:47.841
like... Like this picture here.

22:48.631 --> 22:52.591
You see lions and elephants, giraffes.

22:54.048 --> 22:57.091
And then it's the end of a beautiful
day in the African savannah.

22:58.006 --> 23:01.132
Your dad wants to take you up
this big hill to see the sunset,

23:01.339 --> 23:06.340
but you're too tired, so you just say
you're gonna rest in your hotel room.

23:08.214 --> 23:11.299
So they go, the two of them alone.

23:12.548 --> 23:17.174
And when they get to the top,
the colors of the sky is like...

23:18.048 --> 23:19.757
Like nothing they've ever seen before.

with the Jardines?

(IN SPANISH) Antonio, we have dinner at home,
and I can't come pick you up later.

24:16.673 --> 24:19.090
And I don't like you
walking home alone at night.

24:19.298 --> 24:20.840
JAKE: Well, he could sleep over.

24:21.506 --> 24:23.590
Have you spoken to your father about this?

24:24.006 --> 24:25.965
- JAKE: He won't mind.
- Sure?

- You've met my sister Audrey?
- Oh, yes, of course.

Hi, Leonor, long time no see.

can stay for dinner.

be too late for him to walk home alone.

to have a talk with you

so maybe now's a good time?

Oh, I'm sorry, but this week
is not good for me.

- Next week?

- Could be.
- Thursday I have rehearsal.

onions, cheese and ketchup.

Tony, did I hear your father
lives in Africa?

27:16.964 --> 27:21.173
Yeah, in Angola. It's a small
Portuguese colony in Africa.

27:21.547 --> 27:22.965
I wrote a paper on it last year.

27:23.214 --> 27:25.340
I got a B+, which was
actually pretty good because

27:25.547 --> 27:27.090

but when you really work hard
and put your best effort into it,

27:35.381 --> 27:36.423
they'll give you a bad grade.

thought much about contracts.

glamour to the neighborhood,

We know that's not even possible but,

40:09.630 --> 40:12.089
is that your father
wanted me to stay here.

40:12.671 --> 40:16.506
He thought of me as part of
this house, of this neighborhood.

40:20.213 --> 40:24.839

if you want to know, than you were.

You hardly talked to each other.
You never came to visit.

I was the one here. I saw him every day.

40:39.296 --> 40:40.630
This is not what I came here for.

Just, please, take a look
at the lease, okay?

40:43.171 --> 40:45.172
Let's just get back to that.
It's very fair.

40:46.379 --> 40:47.589
I don't need to.

you and your sister have in mind.

Why not?

43:56.962 --> 43:59.963
- She said you can't come over.
- Why doesn't she want me over?

44:00.212 --> 44:01.338
I don't know.

44:05.004 --> 44:06.838
I don't think your dad wants me
around anymore either.

He may be too chicken
to tell you, but I can tell.

44:09.212 --> 44:10.422
Why are they so mad at us?

44:10.629 --> 44:13.088
Our parents are involved
in a business matter,

44:13.296 --> 44:15.297
and it's getting ugly,
so they're taking it out on us.

44:19.171 --> 44:21.005
You're right, my dad was very cold to you.

Today I got home early

she thinks you owe her money.

- Yeah.

No.

doing this acting thing for a long time.

Really?

46:28.004 --> 46:31.255
When you did the Emotional Recall
exercise, it seemed so natural.

46:32.046 --> 46:34.005
My father was a stunt man
when I was a kid,

46:34.212 --> 46:36.172
so I spent a lot of time
on sets and stuff.

46:36.879 --> 46:38.463
TONY: Oh, so you've been
doing this forever.

46:38.879 --> 46:41.838
Well, no, because when I was
eight years old, he died.

46:42.504 --> 46:43.838
TONY: Did he die doing a stunt?

46:44.212 --> 46:47.338
- No, he had throat cancer.
- TONY: Oh.

with a swimming pool?

47:08.129 --> 47:09.005
No, why?

47:09.296 --> 47:11.255
I would kill to see her in a bathing suit.

47:11.504 --> 47:14.588
- Could you imagine?
- I never thought about that.

- Same with Jake.
- LEONOR: It's very annoying.

is painting and drawing more than ever.

He wanted me to stay here. He told me so.

01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:16.920
And I also have a sister, and she has
a family too, and we have to decide

01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:21.003
what to do about this together.
It's not just up to me.

01:04:22.002 --> 01:04:24.087
You know, your father thought your sister

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:27.212
was the one who inherited his brains.

01:04:31.461 --> 01:04:33.462
I'm sure he'd agree with Audrey...

01:04:34.836 --> 01:04:36.170
that above all else...

01:04:39.127 --> 01:04:40.753
it's important to take care of business.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:42.837
No, he wouldn't have.

01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:45.170
I can promise you.

01:04:45.877 --> 01:04:47.420
What do you want me to say, Leonor?

01:04:48.044 --> 01:04:50.295
I have a family. We have bills, too.

01:04:51.461 --> 01:04:57.795
Do you know why your father didn't come
to your son's birthday, the last one?

01:04:58.627 --> 01:04:59.628
BRIAN: He had the flu.

01:05:00.502 --> 01:05:02.961
Maybe that's what he told you.

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.711
The truth is he was embarrassed

01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:10.836
that everything in your house
was paid for by your wife.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.170
He thought you should be more of a man.

01:05:19.127 --> 01:05:20.128
Well...

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.461
he's not around anymore...

01:05:27.377 --> 01:05:28.420
is he?

01:05:30.169 --> 01:05:31.836
He's certainly not.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.836
(IN SPANISH) Unfortunately, it's a clause
that's common in any commercial contract.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.836
(IN SPANISH) What am I going to do?

01:06:12.176 --> 01:06:14.433
I can't afford this.

01:06:15.112 --> 01:06:17.127
I told you not to go outside.

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:19.679
I told you not to go outside, Antonio!

01:06:20.986 --> 01:06:24.121
I am up to here with this game of yours.

01:06:26.044 --> 01:06:27.628
HERNÁN: I'm sorry, Leo.

01:06:30.169 --> 01:06:33.253
Where do they get this number?

01:06:33.669 --> 01:06:35.761
HERNÁN: It's a penalty.

01:06:35.961 --> 01:06:40.233
It's a penalty for overstaying.
That's why it's in the contract.

01:06:49.127 --> 01:06:50.728
And there's nothing we can do?

01:06:52.169 --> 01:06:55.228
HERNÁN: I've done everything I can.
There's nothing to do.

01:06:59.036 --> 01:07:01.183
You have one week.

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.571
One week to leave this place.

01:07:59.627 --> 01:08:00.628
BRIAN: Yes.

01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:03.003
He's doing his homework.

01:08:04.294 --> 01:08:07.253
TONY: Um, I'd like to talk
to him, if I could.

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:11.420
BRIAN: Of course.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.461
Come in. Why don't you
both come in, please?

01:08:31.292 --> 01:08:33.752
KATHY: Are you sure we can't
get you something, Leonor?

01:08:36.377 --> 01:08:38.919
I'm fine, thanks.

- JAKE: Mom!
- KATHY: What's going on?

01:08:44.377 --> 01:08:47.252
Mom, Tony told me Leonor's
being evacuated from the store!

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:49.919
KATHY: It's not "evacuated,"
it's "evicted."

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.636
How could you do that?
How could you do that to them?

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:54.294
It's a terrible situation.

01:08:54.752 --> 01:08:57.294
The rent is too expensive!
She can't afford it, Mom.

01:08:57.542 --> 01:09:00.169
So Dad just needs to give her
a discount or something so she can.

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:02.461
Your mother and I tried to
talk to you about this, Jake.

01:09:02.752 --> 01:09:03.794
This not talking didn't help.

01:09:04.002 --> 01:09:06.336
- KATHY: Don't blame this on him.
- It's okay, I'm talking now.

01:09:07.127 --> 01:09:08.919
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll never do that again.

01:09:09.127 --> 01:09:11.336
- I promise, Dad, I promise.
- Calm down. Jake, calm down.

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:14.836
- But I have a great idea...
- Listen to me. Your Grandpa Max,

01:09:15.127 --> 01:09:17.627
he didn't just leave this house
for the three of us here.

01:09:17.835 --> 01:09:20.294
No, I know, he loved Leonor, too.
Tony told me!

01:09:20.502 --> 01:09:24.919
BRIAN: Of course he liked Leonor, but he
left it for us and for your Aunt Audrey.

01:09:25.167 --> 01:09:28.127
But I have a great idea.
We go back to our old apartment,

01:09:28.335 --> 01:09:30.586
and we rent this place and give
the money to Aunt Audrey.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.086
Tony and I are both going to be going

01:09:33.292 --> 01:09:35.836
to the LaGuardia High School for
Performing Arts in Manhattan,

01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:38.669
so I don't need to take the
subway or anything to school.

01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:42.169
I could just walk.
And you'll be closer to the theater.

01:09:43.335 --> 01:09:46.252
I loved the show, Dad,
I loved it. I really did.

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.836
Tony did, too. We both talked
about it a lot afterwards.

01:09:50.502 --> 01:09:54.127
And I thought you were really good, and I
thought it was really complex and everything.

01:09:54.877 --> 01:09:58.503
I'm sorry I didn't tell you then,
I'm sorry, but I really liked it, I did.

You still have a lot to do
to finish your portfolio?

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:56.169
JAKE: I just need to finish one more
painting, and then I'm done.

01:12:57.876 --> 01:12:59.336
That's what you said last week.

01:13:00.168 --> 01:13:02.002
You just had to finish one more painting.

I want them to be good.

01:13:07.376 --> 01:13:10.961
Do you remember, by any chance,
a story about my friend Tina?

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.586
The one that sold her hair
in India for a train ticket?

01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:17.086
No, that was Martine.

01:13:17.335 --> 01:13:20.294
Tina was a girl I went to
high school with, she was a...

01:13:20.793 --> 01:13:23.461
Oh. She was a dancer.

01:13:24.376 --> 01:13:28.461
And her mother was a dancer. She was
literally born to be a dancer.

01:13:29.626 --> 01:13:33.586
And during high school, she got
into a really good conservatory,

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.419
and I saw her a couple of times
after that, and

01:13:37.626 --> 01:13:40.627
she was always getting ready
to get this or gonna get that.

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.461
Each time, her arm would be in a sling,

01:13:44.126 --> 01:13:46.419
or she would be on crutches.

01:13:46.835 --> 01:13:50.794
And the last time I saw her,
I ran into her on the subway.

01:13:51.501 --> 01:13:53.461
It was clear she hadn't danced in years.

01:13:53.876 --> 01:13:55.419
She was completely out of shape.

01:13:55.626 --> 01:13:58.294
You would have never imagined
that this was the same girl.

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.836
Gee, thanks, Dad.

01:14:02.626 --> 01:14:04.586
That's a very encouraging story.

01:14:05.126 --> 01:14:06.627
Why didn't Tina go very far?

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:10.169
- I don't know.
- She trained too hard.

01:14:11.335 --> 01:14:12.294
Huh?

01:14:13.043 --> 01:14:14.461
She practiced too much.

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:18.252
She didn't just trust
her natural abilities.

01:14:18.793 --> 01:14:22.294
Jake, you're gonna meet a lot of
really talented people in your life,

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.086
and they're not all
gonna be suited to be artists.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.252
They're not all gonna
have the brains to know

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.252
when to insist and when to...

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.086
to stop.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.961
When to push themselves
and when to just relax.

01:14:39.501 --> 01:14:41.961
Most of them won't all have that balance.

01:14:42.835 --> 01:14:44.669
And how do I know if I have the balance?

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.002
That's why I'm telling you this, because

And you're gonna go to LaGuardia.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.711

find out if you have that balance.
