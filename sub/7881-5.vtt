It's Thanksgiving,
Klaus.

00:35.959 --> 00:37.542
You know what
that means.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.083
A whole day of watching football
in my underwear,

00:43.125 --> 00:46.333
ending with my Redskins
destroying the Cowboys.

00:46.375 --> 00:48.041
Well done, sir.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.166
Won him at a school auction.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.417
What are you waiting for, Stan?

00:52.458 --> 00:55.125
We've only got four hours
of pre-game left.

00:55.166 --> 00:57.625
I'll go make the nachos.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.166
Hurry! They're waking up
Jimmy Johnson!

01:00.208 --> 01:01.542
Jimmy...

01:01.583 --> 01:04.583
Jimmy...

01:05.542 --> 01:07.750
Stan, put your pants on.

01:07.792 --> 01:08.875
No can do, Francine.

01:08.917 --> 01:10.500
This is the first
Thanksgiving in years

01:10.542 --> 01:12.583
where we won't be
entertaining any guests.

01:12.625 --> 01:14.417
I won't have to
put on any airs,

01:14.458 --> 01:16.542
and I certainly won't
be putting on my pants.

01:16.583 --> 01:18.458
But we are
entertaining.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.125
My parents will
be here any minute.

01:20.166 --> 01:21.750
Your parents are coming?

01:21.792 --> 01:23.458
We talked about this.

01:23.500 --> 01:28.750
Stan, I'm gonna invite
my parents for Thanksgiving.

01:28.792 --> 01:31.417
But then I thought about it
and the next day I told you...

01:31.458 --> 01:33.917
You know what, Francine?
Your parents at Thanksgiving,

01:33.959 --> 01:36.166
that's not gonna work for me.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.500
Oh, and, Steve, you'll have to
find someone else to pick you up

01:38.542 --> 01:40.458
after your eye
surgery today.

01:42.959 --> 01:45.250
It's about time, Dad.

01:45.291 --> 01:48.834
Hey, can we stop for pizza?

01:48.875 --> 01:51.250
Stan, it is a family holiday,
after all.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.917
That's right. Our family.
Not your parents.

01:53.959 --> 01:56.375
It's bad enough you and
the kids have to be here.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.083
Well, I'm sorry, Stan.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.917
But growing up
in a Chinese household,

01:59.959 --> 02:01.792
we never had Thanksgiving.

02:01.834 --> 02:03.542
I wanted to introduce 'em to it.

02:03.583 --> 02:06.750
Francine, I'm not running
a master class in Thanksgiving.

02:06.792 --> 02:09.917
Well, I invited 'em and
they're coming and that's that.

02:09.959 --> 02:13.083
Okay, but they eat alone in
the garage, out of trash bags,

02:13.125 --> 02:14.959
and use the neighbor's bathroom.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.250
Can we at least agree to that?

02:16.291 --> 02:19.333
No!
How about they have
full yard privileges,

02:19.375 --> 02:21.333
two unrefrigerated sodas apiece,

02:21.375 --> 02:23.792
and at the end of the night
I'll say a chilly good-bye

02:23.834 --> 02:25.375
to the parent of your choosing?

02:25.417 --> 02:26.417
Do we have a deal?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.834
I'll ask you
again in the car.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.291
You stay here.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.875
If you're just tuning in now,
things are really heating up!

02:37.917 --> 02:40.166
Both teams have almost
completely checked out

02:40.208 --> 02:42.041
- of their hotels.
- That's right.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.250
And with three hours
until the coin toss

02:44.291 --> 02:46.583
it is still anybody's game!

02:46.625 --> 02:49.291
Hmm.
What's wrong, man?

02:49.333 --> 02:51.250
Francine's parents
are coming.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.291
They're totally gonna ruin
the Thanksgiving I had planned.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.625
They're here.

02:55.667 --> 02:56.917
Aw, this is gonna suck.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.125
I got it!

03:02.542 --> 03:05.917
Ah, your Chinese gibberish
very mediocre.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.792
Either really learn language
or go broader.

03:08.834 --> 03:11.291
Just so you know, there's gonna
be football on today.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.834
I don't expect you
to understand.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.041
It's an American thing.

03:14.083 --> 03:17.208
U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!

03:17.250 --> 03:19.000
Come on, buddy, you got to join
me or I look like a total jerk.

03:19.041 --> 03:21.083
U-S-A! U-S-A!

03:21.125 --> 03:22.667
Man, I-I want to,

03:22.709 --> 03:25.458
but I don't know the words.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.667
Hello, Granddaughter.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.166
We share room tonight.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.542
Aw, you look sad.
What's wrong?

03:33.583 --> 03:35.250
Greasy face got you down?

03:35.291 --> 03:38.375
No, I-I'm sad because this
is the first Thanksgiving

03:38.417 --> 03:39.834
I've spent without Jeff.

03:39.875 --> 03:43.125
Let me tell you what my mom
tell me when I was your age:

03:43.166 --> 03:47.125
"Man you love die in space
so you marry Bah Bah now."

03:47.166 --> 03:48.917
We need find you new man.

03:48.959 --> 03:52.041
Thanks, Mah Mah,
but I'm just not over Jeff.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.583
That's because you still
surrounded by him.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.166
Reminders everywhere.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.417
You need to get rid
of his stuff.

04:08.542 --> 04:09.959
Hey, that was mine!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.583
Sorry. Here.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.959
Use my pipe till I replace.

04:13.959 --> 04:18.458
It work real good,
make you cough a lot.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.291
Francine, what the hell's
goin' on in here?

04:24.333 --> 04:26.208
It should smell like turkey
and stuffing,

04:26.250 --> 04:28.959
not a medley of
longevity-inducing vegetables.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.250
Stan, this is my
mom's famous stir-fry.

04:32.291 --> 04:35.000
I thought we could have it
instead of sweet potatoes.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.750
But that's not Thanksgiving!

04:36.792 --> 04:38.625
I don't want
to see this tiny corn!

04:38.667 --> 04:40.417
I don't want to see
your tiny corn!

04:40.458 --> 04:42.000
Put on some pants!

04:42.041 --> 04:45.250
I'm not changing the way I dress
on this most American of days.

04:45.291 --> 04:48.125
This is traditional
American Thanksgiving garb.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.291
You know how you guys always
wear karate outfits?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.417
Well, this is Uncle Sam's
version of that.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.959
Stan, just go watch
some football.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.583
I'll call you
when dinner's ready.

04:56.583 --> 04:59.583
Stan, quick! They're
bringing out the turducken!

04:59.625 --> 05:02.083
This year FOX has
genetically engineered

05:02.125 --> 05:04.083
an actual living turducken.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.166
Those are its screams.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.417
Its every step is agony.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.625
What the hell?

05:10.667 --> 05:12.333
I try to make picture better.

05:12.375 --> 05:13.792
No, please, God, no.

05:15.375 --> 05:18.750
Aiya, picture
better before.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.000
Stan,
what's wrong?!

05:21.041 --> 05:22.792
Your dad broke the TV!

05:22.834 --> 05:24.250
My holiday is ruined!

05:24.291 --> 05:26.834
Steve! Your Thanksgiving
marionettes!

05:26.875 --> 05:28.875
This is the perfect time
for them!

05:30.291 --> 05:32.542
I just got to untangle them
and I'll be right down!

05:32.583 --> 05:34.417
Disaster averted.

05:34.458 --> 05:35.875
Francine, how long
have we been married

05:35.917 --> 05:37.667
without me raising
a hand to you?

05:37.709 --> 05:40.083
Look, if you want
your television fixed,

05:40.125 --> 05:41.667
call the Nerd Squad.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.792
Yes! A squad of nerds!

05:43.834 --> 05:45.792
They'll know what to do!
What's the number?

05:45.834 --> 05:48.208
I'll call them,
but in the meantime,

05:48.250 --> 05:52.250
can you at least make an effort
to get along with my family?

05:52.291 --> 05:55.000
I'll try.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.208
As long as her parents
are in this house,

05:59.250 --> 06:01.291
I can't enjoy the Thanksgiving
I deserve.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.959
We have to get rid of them.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.917
Oh, my God.

06:04.959 --> 06:08.417
Are you suggesting an
organized and systematic...

06:08.458 --> 06:09.417
No.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.750
All right, Klaus,
we're the Pilgrims

06:15.792 --> 06:17.750
and Francine's parents
are the Indians.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.542
If we want to save
this Thanksgiving,

06:19.542 --> 06:21.417
we've got to get them
out of this house.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.083
Okay, first, you're calling
yourself a Pilgrim,

06:23.125 --> 06:24.375
but you're dressed
like an Indian.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.834
It's very confusing.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.750
Second, didn't the Pilgrims
invite the Indians to dinner?

06:28.792 --> 06:30.291
Klaus, you're missing the point.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.917
It might not have even happened.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.875
It's just a story that teaches
us to treat each other nicely.

06:34.917 --> 06:37.166
Now, we got to get these
stupid idiots out of our house!

06:37.208 --> 06:39.625
I see. And how do you plan
to do that?

06:39.667 --> 06:41.667
Why, exploit their fears,
of course.

06:41.709 --> 06:44.333
And throughout time,
what has consistently been

06:44.375 --> 06:46.625
the Chinese people's
greatest enemy?

06:47.500 --> 06:50.625
Roar!

06:59.125 --> 07:01.583
Godzilla Japanese.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.625
I'm the ghost
of Genghis Khan!

07:08.667 --> 07:10.667
I just got through
your Great Wall,

07:10.709 --> 07:14.166
and I'm going to
plunder your culture!

07:14.208 --> 07:19.041
Actually, not all Chinese people
think of Genghis Khan as scary.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.583
Many Chinese view him
as great military leader

07:21.625 --> 07:25.375
who laid down groundwork
for the third new dynasty.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.750
Francine, I
bought a horse.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.375
Ferocious panda
on the loose!

07:35.417 --> 07:37.625
Run! Run
for your lives!

07:39.834 --> 07:41.709
It's got a gun!

07:43.667 --> 07:46.083
Huh. I don't know why you guys
are terrified of these things.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.750
We're not.
We love them.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.166
I knew it was
one of the two.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.542
Francine,
I bought a panda.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.375
Stupid Bah Bah.

07:56.417 --> 07:58.792
Ruining my Thanksgiving Day
football.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.166
Now?

08:00.208 --> 08:01.667
Do you see
anything now?

08:01.709 --> 08:03.709
No, keep trying.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.333
Stan, I'm completely immersed
in water.

08:05.375 --> 08:08.083
Maybe I am not the one
to be futzing with the TV.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.208
Oh, don't be
such a baby.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.583
Ooh, ooh!
You almost had it!

08:13.625 --> 08:14.875
Wh-Whatever you did,
do it again!

08:16.709 --> 08:18.000
Nerd Squad.
I'm Trevor.

08:18.041 --> 08:19.959
Your wife called,
your TV's out.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.333
Oh, Roger, awesome!

08:21.375 --> 08:22.875
I said it's Trevor.

08:22.917 --> 08:24.417
Wait, do you really know
what you're doing

08:24.458 --> 08:25.667
or is this just a disguise?

08:25.709 --> 08:27.208
Sir, I have a family, too,

08:27.250 --> 08:28.917
that I would like to
spend Thanksgiving with,

08:28.959 --> 08:31.083
so if you can just
show me your TV.

08:31.709 --> 08:33.000
It's right here.

08:33.041 --> 08:36.083
Oh, wow, it usually takes me
a half hour to find those.

08:38.583 --> 08:39.709
Perfect, Stan!

08:39.750 --> 08:41.208
If Roger fixes the TV,

08:41.250 --> 08:43.709
then maybe Francine's parents
can stay after all.

08:43.750 --> 08:47.083
Francine, where do you
recycle your chicken heads?

08:47.125 --> 08:50.083
No. No, if I don't put
a stop to this now,

08:50.125 --> 08:52.959
they're just gonna
come back every year.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.500
Oh, I just realized
this thing is tubeless.

08:55.542 --> 08:57.250
That might
be a problem.

08:57.291 --> 08:58.500
Jeremy, it's Trev.

08:58.542 --> 09:00.458
We're gonna have
to open up a new ticket.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.208
Stan, why you pay
good money?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.333
I could fix.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.583
You don't need to call
Nerd Brigade.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.750
Sir, I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to step in here.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.875
I am from the
Nerd Squad, okay?

09:10.917 --> 09:14.083
The Nerd Brigade wishes
they were the Nerd Squad.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.625
Trust me, all right?
Trust me on that.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.583
Ask anyone who does audiovisual
in the Langley Falls area

09:19.625 --> 09:22.000
and they will tell you
that they prefer the Nerd Squad

09:22.041 --> 09:24.375
all... day... long.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.000
Okay? Y-You want me to wait?

09:26.041 --> 09:28.667
You want me to wait here for you
while you ask anyone in town?

09:28.709 --> 09:29.834
'Cause I'll be here.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.750
I'll be right here
fixing your TV right.

09:32.792 --> 09:36.166
The first time. On Thanksgiving.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.917
You know
what I'm thankful for? Huh?

09:37.959 --> 09:40.417
I am thankful that I work
for the best damn

09:40.458 --> 09:43.208
home theater installation
company in town.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.542
The Nerd Squad!

09:45.583 --> 09:48.083
Oh, that's right.
I work for the other one.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.500
Jeremy, we're gonna have
to give a customer a free cable.

09:50.542 --> 09:53.625
Um, put it under Code 60,
Customer Satisfaction.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.667
I'll just give him
a three-foot HDMI.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.583
It'll only go from the receiver
to the TV.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.583
He can't use it
for anything else.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.458
This was his greatest invention,

10:05.500 --> 10:07.792
a snowboard with wheels on it.

10:07.834 --> 10:10.250
For sidewalks.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.917
Hi-ya.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.250
Okay, you got rid
of Jeff's stuff.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.792
First step done.

10:15.834 --> 10:17.834
Next step,
get you new man.

10:17.875 --> 10:21.250
I appreciate that, Mah Mah,
but it's just not that easy.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.000
Oh, it not easy?

10:23.041 --> 10:24.291
'Cause it already done.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.583
Big Wang Bai!

10:25.625 --> 10:27.125
Uh, what?

10:27.166 --> 10:28.542
Big Wang Bai!

10:28.583 --> 10:29.875
He your new boyfriend.

10:29.917 --> 10:31.834
His grandma and I frenemies.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.458
He big success.
Wear clothes by Ralph Lauren.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.875
Okay...

10:35.917 --> 10:37.792
You need more? Fine!

10:37.834 --> 10:38.709
I show you.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.000
See? Look.

10:40.041 --> 10:43.083
Big Wang ride Segway
in downtown Long Beach.

10:43.125 --> 10:46.625
Big Wang never let
his Groupons expire.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.750
He pose on Ferrari!

10:48.792 --> 10:51.792
Hey, Ferraris.
Those cost money.

10:51.834 --> 10:53.333
Shh! You missing Big Wang

10:53.375 --> 10:54.834
wearing white button-down
and jeans

10:54.875 --> 10:56.500
and taking picture
with friends.

10:56.542 --> 10:59.333
Then, he goes to party
and wear all white,

10:59.375 --> 11:02.125
even string
in puka shell necklace white!

11:02.166 --> 11:04.458
He bad boy for life.

11:04.500 --> 11:08.291
Oh, he order extra large
Blizzard at Dairy Queen

11:08.333 --> 11:09.875
and finish!

11:09.917 --> 11:13.458
Mmm. Where are you
puttin' it, Big Wang?

11:13.500 --> 11:14.959
Wait. What am I thinking?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.417
Big Wang Bai too good
for Hayley.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.291
But not too good for Mah Mah.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.625
I guess it wouldn't
hurt to contact him.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.875
No, no, no.
No, he no right for you.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.375
But I thought...
He taken!

11:26.417 --> 11:28.125
But it says here
he's single.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.625
What was that for?

11:30.667 --> 11:33.000
Haven't you ever seen
The Gong Show?

11:33.041 --> 11:35.125
You lose! Get out!

11:35.166 --> 11:36.709
But it's my room.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.500
Yeah, you're all set.

11:44.542 --> 11:46.000
You got all your
channels now,

11:46.041 --> 11:48.792
although, unfortunately,
because of a licensing dispute,

11:48.834 --> 11:53.500
you currently don't get
A&E, TBS, FX, AMC or ESPN.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.250
But you do get our
satellite radio package,

11:56.291 --> 11:59.333
featuring Reggae Sunsets
on channel 1,200.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.125
Great! I can't
thank you enough.

12:01.166 --> 12:02.709
Oh, well, if you feel that way,

12:02.750 --> 12:04.291
and you get a call
from my company

12:04.333 --> 12:06.083
about completing a survey
about the service,

12:06.125 --> 12:08.667
it'd be a big help to me
if you mentioned my name.

12:08.709 --> 12:09.750
Oh, yeah, definitely.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.375
Thank you so much.

12:11.417 --> 12:12.583
What's my name?

12:12.625 --> 12:16.000
Rrr... uh, Rizz...

12:16.041 --> 12:17.083
Rizzoli?

12:17.125 --> 12:18.875
Rizzoli and Isles?

12:18.917 --> 12:21.291
I associate Rizzoli and Isles
with cable.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.625
Are you one of them?

12:22.667 --> 12:25.125
Just for that, I'm giving
you Starz and Encore.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.250
Have fun
flippin' past 'em.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.792
Look at that, Stan.
The TV's fixed.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.125
This Thanksgiving
might be salvaged yet.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.542
I told you. It's no longer
about the TV.

12:36.583 --> 12:39.625
We've got to flush these
Chinese Indians off our land.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.834
Stan, honey, dinner.

12:46.625 --> 12:49.458
Oh. Oh, gang, bad news.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.792
Bad news, especially
for anyone old and Chinese.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.792
I just got back
from the doctor,

12:54.834 --> 12:58.375
and the results show
I'm positive for bird flu.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.667
This just receipt
from Arby's.

13:00.709 --> 13:02.709
How you eat ten
beef and cheddars?

13:02.750 --> 13:04.375
They were
sliders!

13:04.417 --> 13:05.750
Hey, that's
my chair!

13:05.792 --> 13:07.917
I am guest,
which makes it my chair.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.834
Stan, just sit
somewhere else.

13:09.875 --> 13:10.917
But that's
my chair!

13:10.959 --> 13:12.875
Don't be such a baby!

13:12.917 --> 13:15.000
And take the trash out
before we eat.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.875
It's stinking up the house.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.709
'Sup? I'm Big Wang Bai.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.041
This the... Smith house?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.166
They're all inside.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.500
Big Wang Bai?

13:30.542 --> 13:32.542
What are you
doing here?

13:32.583 --> 13:33.834
Who invite you?

13:33.875 --> 13:35.208
I did, Mah Mah.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.458
You whore!

13:38.500 --> 13:41.500
Big Wang, have you met
my grandmother, Mah Mah?

13:41.542 --> 13:42.959
No, I haven't.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.041
Hello. I'm Big Wang Bai.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.083
My mother's told me
all about you.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.250
I-I'm sorry.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.834
I no want
to meet this way.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.709
I must put on face cream
and holiday wig.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.709
You want me
to take out the trash?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.959
I'll take out the Mah Mah
and Bah Bah.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.166
'Cause they're trash.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.041
They're the ones
stinking up the house.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.208
'Cause they're stinkers.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.750
They're a couple of stinkers.

14:07.792 --> 14:11.041
Aah! Why don't I ever think
of these things in the moment?

14:11.083 --> 14:12.166
Hey!

14:12.208 --> 14:14.583
They threw out
my Redskins headdress!

14:21.500 --> 14:22.792
Look at them.

14:22.834 --> 14:26.000
They've taken over my home.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.875
Oh, my God.

14:27.917 --> 14:29.458
I'm not the Pilgrim.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.625
I'm the Indian,
and I've lost my home.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.750
I belong nowhere.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.583
I guess I walk the land now.

14:39.125 --> 14:40.250
Here, Dixie Cup!

14:45.583 --> 14:47.750
Easy, girl. Easy.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.417
I've been displaced.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.709
I must wander, seeking a land
where I might belong.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.709
At least I have the radio
to keep me company.

15:07.750 --> 15:11.208
Coming up next, 20 minutes
of reflective silence.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.625
Perfect.

15:21.709 --> 15:22.875
You ever eat
here before?

15:22.917 --> 15:24.250
Every year.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.208
Must be good.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.709
Excuse me,
you can't eat here.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.667
You're not homeless.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.542
How'd you know?

15:28.583 --> 15:29.875
You're wearing
a wedding ring,

15:29.917 --> 15:31.875
which means
you haven't sold it for drugs.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.291
Your eyebrows
are well-groomed,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.125
suggesting a recent visit
to the salon.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.291
And while I smell beer
on your breath,

15:37.333 --> 15:39.917
it has a whiff of the...
Dutch lowlands,

15:39.959 --> 15:41.458
which means
it's imported.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.750
And only homeowners
drink imported beer.

15:46.542 --> 15:49.625
Shirley, you got to
come back to the force.

15:49.667 --> 15:52.041
You were the best detective
this city ever had.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.458
Sorry, I feel like
I make a bigger difference

15:54.500 --> 15:57.250
recognizing
who's not homeless.

16:01.208 --> 16:04.709
The stadium.
Packed with Redskins fans.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.125
I may have just found my people.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.250
Ticket, please.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.625
Oh, I don't have one,
but trust me,

16:16.667 --> 16:17.625
I need to be in there.

16:17.667 --> 16:18.542
It's where I belong.

16:18.583 --> 16:19.834
So, you don't
have a ticket?

16:19.875 --> 16:21.208
No, but I'm a Redskins fan.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.500
I've been here
since the beginning.

16:22.542 --> 16:24.542
Oh. Okay, well, here's
how the system works.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.083
You need a ticket.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.125
Oh, I-I have one right here!

16:28.166 --> 16:29.834
Sir, that's a
receipt from Arby's,

16:29.875 --> 16:32.709
and I'm not gonna touch it,
because, from what I can tell,

16:32.750 --> 16:35.041
its been in
your underpants.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.083
Hey, man, Redskins suck!

16:44.125 --> 16:45.792
I just want to pass!

16:45.834 --> 16:47.875
I seek no fight,
nor do I offer it!

16:47.917 --> 16:49.875
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy now, partner.

16:49.917 --> 16:51.083
You didn't let me finish.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.083
I was gonna say
that Redskins suck,

16:53.125 --> 16:56.542
but Redskins fans are just fine
in my book,

16:56.583 --> 16:59.125
and welcome
to partake of our bounty.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.375
I'm always tellin' him

17:00.417 --> 17:02.041
to structure
his sentences better.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.375
I'm Laura.
This is Marvin.

17:03.417 --> 17:05.166
You up for
a tailgate, hon?

17:05.208 --> 17:08.375
Thanks, but winter is upon me,
and I'm close to death.

17:08.417 --> 17:09.917
I need to get somewhere warm.

17:09.959 --> 17:12.542
Well, hell, there's plenty
of warmth right here.

17:12.583 --> 17:13.792
Tonight's foam
finger night,

17:13.834 --> 17:15.917
and these East Coast
folks love to litter.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.291
Let me show you
a little cowboy trick.

17:20.333 --> 17:23.083
I feel like I'm nestled
in the womb of a Nerf lady.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.083
Oh, yeah,
pretty warm, right?

17:25.125 --> 17:27.291
Now how about a nice,
cold beer?

17:28.834 --> 17:30.375
Now, hold on there, chief.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.500
Those ain't free.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.208
I'm sorry. I don't
have any money.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.583
Well, that's good,
'cause we only accept these.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.500
Up high!

17:37.542 --> 17:39.834
Now you're talkin',
Geronimo!

17:39.875 --> 17:43.125
Let's sit down and talk trash
about each other's teams.

17:44.709 --> 17:47.709
Marvin, 911!
We just ran out of propane!

17:47.750 --> 17:51.083
Shoot, we'll never get the grill
up to 400 degrees now!

17:51.125 --> 17:55.375
Ain't no tailgate without
properly seared turkey burgers.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.792
Okay, everyone, pack it up.

17:57.834 --> 17:59.959
We're drivin' back to Texas.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.542
Wait! Did you
say 400 degrees?

18:02.583 --> 18:08.333
Marvin, Laura, it's time
for me to give back to you.

18:09.875 --> 18:13.166
Three minutes in
neutral at 5,000 RPMs!

18:13.208 --> 18:16.083
That engine block's at
precisely 400 degrees.

18:16.125 --> 18:16.959
Yay!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.125
Yee-haw!

18:22.542 --> 18:24.291
I think you're
an amazing girl,

18:24.333 --> 18:27.333
but I'm just not sure
this is gonna work.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.875
Not even with youthful
holiday wig?

18:31.917 --> 18:35.500
I would say especially
with youthful holiday wig.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.041
Come on, Mah Mah.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.625
Everyone's waiting
to eat dessert

18:38.667 --> 18:40.417
and is very embarrassed
for you.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.458
Sorry about that.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.458
You want to come downstairs
and have some pie?

18:48.500 --> 18:51.500
Or stay up here and do the same?

18:51.542 --> 18:56.792
Sorry, Hayley.
I've made other dessert plans.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.291
Hayley, you didn't think

18:58.333 --> 19:00.625
I was gonna let Big Wang slip
through my fingers, did you?

19:00.667 --> 19:03.000
Come on, I've still got
two big installs tonight,

19:03.041 --> 19:06.333
but only one more job to do,
if you get my drift.

19:14.417 --> 19:17.250
Marvin, Laura,
various other hicks,

19:17.291 --> 19:21.250
that was the best Thanksgiving
dinner I've ever had.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.250
Who is this guy?!

19:23.291 --> 19:25.959
Exactly! Who am I?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.667
Who am I to you?

19:27.709 --> 19:30.834
Me, a Redskins fan,
you, all Cowboy fans.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Anyone seen my kid?

19:37.291 --> 19:39.917
We couldn't be more opposite
on this day.

19:39.959 --> 19:42.208
But you welcomed me
into your parking space

19:42.250 --> 19:43.709
and taught me how to survive.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.959
'Course we
did, Stan.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.417
'Cause where
we come from,

19:46.458 --> 19:48.792
Thanksgiving's about
sharing diverse cultures,

19:48.834 --> 19:52.250
no matter who you are or
how much your team sucks.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.375
Or how Chinese you are!

19:57.709 --> 20:00.417
Seriously, I'm gonna be in real
trouble if I can't find him.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.959
I'm home!
I made it home!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.792
Stan, where have you been?!

20:09.834 --> 20:12.208
You took the trash out
hours ago!

20:12.250 --> 20:14.041
I've been to a wonderful place.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.875
I was tailgating in the parking
lot with Cowboys fans.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.458
They taught me how to make
a vest out of foam fingers,

20:19.500 --> 20:22.291
and I taught them
how to cook burgers on my car.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.500
And I learned the true meaning
of Thanksgiving.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.375
That you should accept everyone,

20:26.417 --> 20:29.709
no matter their team colors
or their skin color or...

20:29.750 --> 20:31.166
or how horrible they are.

20:31.208 --> 20:34.166
