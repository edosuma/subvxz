If you don't like that paper,

02:32.600 --> 02:34.000
why do you read it every day?

02:34.080 --> 02:36.400
Because I'm a reporter, Taylor.
I'm curious.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.760
Besides, it's important to keep
your eye on the competition.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.480
<i>The Daily Examiner</i> is a competitor
to <i>The New York Times?</i>

02:42.560 --> 02:46.160
-I know it's hard to believe, but true.
-I read it religiously.

the way I like it?

02:48.320 --> 02:51.360
-Like charcoal briquettes.

Can you two maybe try to get along
while I'm out of town?

02:58.880 --> 03:01.440
I can try, but it's been my
experience that she can't.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.800
I assure you, can't and won't
are two very different things.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.360
-Lex, this is your article in the paper.
-What?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.800
Yuck, it's a gooey love picture.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.960
I can't believe it.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.840
I submitted this to the
Junior Journalist column weeks ago,

03:17.920 --> 03:21.240
-and they actually ran it.
-You've been selected. This is wonderful.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.080
Oh, it is, honey.
They ran your photo.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.640
I used Taylor's digital spy camera. It
shoots pictures from around the corner.

-What's the article about, Lex?
-You used my camera?

03:31.680 --> 03:35.160
It's just a story about Miss Dawson
and her friendship with Mr. Walker.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.600
They're teachers at Millington.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.120

And you call yourself a writer.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.040
She was the most famous

I am not a gossip columnist.

is a human interest piece.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.480

06:19.920 --> 06:22.000
If I told you, it wouldn't
be a secret, would it, Gabe?

06:22.080 --> 06:26.040
How'd you get that shot of Mr. Walker?
He won't allow his picture in yearbook.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.280

reporter is always on the job."

-Hi, Gabe.
-Hey, Jennifer.

So, how excited are you about getting
your article in<i> The Daily Examiner?</i>

06:38.400 --> 06:41.640
-Everyone's talking about it.
-Well, Jack Downey just trashed it.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.000
(SCOFFS) Of course he did.
He's so jealous.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.440
-You think?
-Come on.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.040
You snapped an amazing picture
of your teacher's good side,

06:48.120 --> 06:51.080
then you wrote a killer article
about their secret romance,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.760
and it happened to run in
a major New York newspaper.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.960
Think about it.
The editor of the school paper

06:56.040 --> 06:58.000
is upstaged by
a member of his own staff.

-He's dying over this.
-You're so right, Jen. Thanks.

-So true.

saw the picture?

It's hard to tell.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.400

You get to travel the world,
explore different cultures,

08:19.520 --> 08:22.680
meet lots of interesting people. But...

08:23.200 --> 08:27.680
It's a lonely life,
filled with empty hotel rooms

08:27.760 --> 08:30.680
and late-night meals
in two-bit diners.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.280

come look at these mock-ups?

08:50.360 --> 08:53.920
Ugh, I think my brain is in
meltdown. Can we go home yet?

08:54.080 --> 08:57.360

do without me? Listen to this.

"Dear Lexy, my friend
and I had a fight.

09:04.920 --> 09:09.000
This is a bummer. What will
you prescribe, Dr. Gold?

09:09.080 --> 09:12.360
Well, I'm thinking that she has to be
honest and tell her how she feels.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.920
-That's what I'd do with you.
-And I with you.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.520
Then, she should reward
herself for speaking out

09:17.600 --> 09:19.920
by picking up a cute
little jelly roll handbag.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.760
-JEN: Excellent advice.
-(SCOFFS)

09:21.840 --> 09:23.720
She'll feel better in no time.

an article and photograph

-All right.
-Yeah.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.240
Your editor, Jack Downey,
would now like to say a few words.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.520
I would?

10:06.560 --> 10:09.480
Uh, I mean, yeah, I would.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.960
Thank you, Mr. Goldblum. Uh...

10:13.040 --> 10:15.960
I guess I'd just like to say
that we're all proud

10:16.040 --> 10:20.080
when one of our own is able to make
their way onto a more visible platform.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.160
Especially a colleague from one
of our, well, softer news areas.

if you want to make the next issue.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.880
-This story's kind of old news.
-You know what, Jack?

10:45.960 --> 10:47.640
I actually owe you a thank you.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.000
It was because you wouldn't run
my story in the school paper

10:50.080 --> 10:52.320
that I sent it to<i> The Daily</i>
Examiner in the first place.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.520
STUDENTS: (LAUGHING) Ooh.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.320
MR. WALKER:
Gertrude, you startled me.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.400
MISS DAWSON:
I need to talk to you.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.680
(STAMMERING) What more
is there to say?

11:05.480 --> 11:07.000
I just don't understand.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.280
MR. WALKER:
Don't talk so loud, okay?

11:10.520 --> 11:12.640
I, I... I never...

11:12.720 --> 11:14.240
I never meant to hurt you.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.280
Oh, really?
Then what did you mean to do?

11:19.960 --> 11:23.680
What changed?
We made all those plans.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.840
Orlando, I love you.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.840
Okay, well, I don't love you.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.040
That's what's changed.
Can you understand that?

11:37.160 --> 11:39.200
I guess I'm gonna have to try.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.880
I'm sorry I ever met you.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.280
If you think I'll continue
to pass you in these halls,

11:48.360 --> 11:50.480
you're sadly mistaken.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.280
One of us has to leave Millington,

11:52.360 --> 11:55.960
and I assure you
it's not going to be me.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.440
-Hi, Miss Dawson.
-Hi, Lexy.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.960
Hey, you.
About ready for bed?

12:23.040 --> 12:25.960
Yeah. I just had to finish
answering mail for my column.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.880
There just aren't
enough hours in the day.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.640
Sorry I missed dinner.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.240
The press conference
I was covering ran long.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.400
The mayor was asking state
legislators to increase aid

12:36.480 --> 12:40.720
to city schools, and let's just
say things didn't go very well.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.320
It's okay, Dad.
That sounds pretty important.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.360
Well, not as important as you.
Bedtime.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.240
-And how was your day?
-It was okay.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.720
Hmm. I, um...

12:56.800 --> 12:59.120
Read your article.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.040
Nice job. It's well written.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.040
You've got a good theme.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.360
I'd call it a heartwarming
piece of journalism.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.960
-Really?
-Absolutely.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.240
Dad, have you ever
written something that...

13:13.800 --> 13:15.960
I don't know, caused
something else to happen?

13:16.040 --> 13:19.360
Well, sure. That's what journalism
is all about, and you'll get there.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.680
This is good work, Lex.
You should be proud.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.240
I'm proud.
I'm really proud. I just...

13:24.360 --> 13:27.280
I want to write a hard news
piece, you know? Like you do.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.200
You don't start with hard news. You work
your way up to it. That's what I did.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.320
How?

13:32.600 --> 13:35.800
Well, let's see. I was
working at<i> The Mercury Herald</i>

13:35.880 --> 13:38.440
in the classifieds
when I got a lead on something.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.320
I did a little investigation
on my own and discovered

13:41.400 --> 13:45.560
a toxic waste dump was hidden
underneath the local burger joint.

13:45.920 --> 13:50.040
So I pitched the story to the editor,
and made the front page of<i> The Herald.</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:52.160
After that, they made me staff writer.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.920
Wow.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.960
There's stories all around you, Lex.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.000
You just have to keep
your eyes open,

13:58.080 --> 14:00.800
and when you get a hunch
about something, investigate it.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.280
-I think I can do that.
-I know you can do that.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.720
You'll be amazed what hard work,

14:07.800 --> 14:11.440
imagination
and a little luck will bring you.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.160
-Good night.
-Hugs and kisses, Dad.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.720
Hugs and kisses, my sweet girl.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.760
REPORTER:
In or around the vehicle.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.360
As you can see behind me,
the vehicle is a light-colored sedan.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.120
Anyone who may have
seen what happened...

14:52.960 --> 14:55.720
-How you doin', man?
-Good. Thanks.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.200
Lexy, sweetie, wake up.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.160
Huh? Dad, what time is it?

15:10.240 --> 15:13.440
Honey, I've got something to
tell you and it's not very easy.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.240
I just got a call from one
of the editors at the paper,

15:16.320 --> 15:18.960
and apparently your
teacher, Mr. Walker...

15:19.360 --> 15:21.160
He's missing.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.040
Wait. What happened?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.760
There isn't much information yet,

15:24.840 --> 15:29.320
but they did find his car in the
East River early this morning.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.480
Oh, my gosh.
(STAMMERING) And Mr. Walker?

15:31.560 --> 15:33.120
He hasn't been found yet.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.840
There's a lot of speculation,
but... Things don't look very good.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.280
Look, kiddo. This is gonna be a tough day
for you. Why don't you get ready,

15:40.360 --> 15:42.560
and I'll walk you to school.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.560
Wow. I can't...
I can't believe this.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.560
(PHONE RINGS)

15:52.080 --> 15:54.520
Jen! Jen, wake up!

15:54.640 --> 15:56.960
-Huh?
-<i>Mr. Walker... He's missing.</i>

15:57.040 --> 15:58.960
He's what?

16:00.480 --> 16:02.800
LEXY: <i>News of Mr. Walker's</i>
<i>bizarre disappearance</i>

16:02.880 --> 16:05.440
<i>spread faster than word</i>
<i>of a Barney's Warehouse sale.</i>

16:05.520 --> 16:08.320
<i>All I know is, if he set foot</i>
<i>into that toxic river,</i>

16:08.400 --> 16:12.600
<i>he's gonna need a serious head-to-toe</i>

16:12.680 --> 16:14.960
<i>Even the fish refuse to live there.</i>

16:17.320 --> 16:20.120
<i>Jeez, there's a lot</i>
<i>of cameras here.</i>

16:20.200 --> 16:22.120
<i>I hope they get my good side.</i>

16:35.280 --> 16:38.000
The only good thing about being
in mourning is black is always in.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.520
I know. Whoever thought of that
was so far ahead of their time.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.320
I can't believe all of the coverage
Mr. Walker's getting.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.200
Who would have thought
he was so popular?

16:47.280 --> 16:49.840
LEXY: Miss Stern's outfit
is to die for, literally.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.600
Isn't it strange that the day after my
article runs, he just disappears?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.360
Yeah. It's a real shame.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.480
A shame? It's too weird.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.160
All right, Lexy,
so what's the scoop on Mr. Walker?

17:02.240 --> 17:03.480
-What?
-Come on.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.480
I know you have the inside story
on him. Where is he?

17:06.560 --> 17:09.400
I have no idea, but you're
really starting to bug me.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.760
Well, as you all know, we've had
a bit of a crisis in our school.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.520
Mr. Walk... (CLEARS THROAT)

17:21.160 --> 17:23.120
Mr. Walker... (CLEARS THROAT)

17:23.200 --> 17:27.480
Nonetheless, classes will
continue for the time being.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.560
Now, our next
guest speaker is here.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.200
He is a small-business owner

17:33.280 --> 17:35.680
who is
an award-winning taxidermist.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.280
Everyone, Mr. Greenblatt.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.280
LEXY: <i>Poor Miss Dawson.</i>
<i>The man she loves is missing,</i>

17:43.360 --> 17:46.160
<i>and even worse, yesterday</i>
<i>he told her to take a hike.</i>

17:46.240 --> 17:48.560
<i>She must be wiggin'.</i>
<i>A deep-tissue massage</i>

17:48.640 --> 17:51.640
<i>at the Peacock Spa</i>
<i>would do her wonders.</i>

17:53.520 --> 17:56.640
-(GASPS)
-Now, if at all possible,

17:56.720 --> 17:59.120
wrap your fish in a wet towel.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.240
-Then...
-Excuse me, Miss Dawson.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.080
Is Lexy Gold here?

18:07.080 --> 18:08.960
Me?

18:23.680 --> 18:25.480
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:25.560 --> 18:29.080
-Ah. Alexandra Gold?
-Am I in trouble for something?

18:29.160 --> 18:32.160
No, no. I was wondering if
I could ask you a few questions.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.560
I'm Detective Potter.
Please sit down.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.080
How do I know you're
really a detective?

18:42.160 --> 18:43.840
(GRUNTS)

18:48.520 --> 18:49.760
Oh.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.600
Now, I understand you write

18:51.680 --> 18:54.320
a gossip column
for the school newspaper?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.520
It's an advice column.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.280
It seems you may have special
knowledge about a relationship

18:59.360 --> 19:01.640
between Mr. Walker
and Miss Dawson. Is that correct?

19:02.920 --> 19:05.560
(SCOFFS)

19:05.640 --> 19:07.160
Oh.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.640
Before I go any further,
I just want to say congratulations

19:11.720 --> 19:13.920
on your article
in yesterday's<i> Daily Examiner.</i>

19:14.000 --> 19:16.160
-It was most impressive.
-Oh, you saw it?

19:16.240 --> 19:18.800
Oh, yes. What a great photo.
Did you take it?

19:18.880 --> 19:21.480
Yes, I did. Thank you.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.480
You know, up until my article
ran, I was the only one

19:24.560 --> 19:27.120
who knew how in love
Mr. Walker and Miss Dawson were.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.160
Well, I told
my best friend Jennifer.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.760
And then yesterday...

19:31.960 --> 19:35.600
-What happened yesterday?
-Well, they broke up.

19:35.680 --> 19:39.280
Actually, he broke up with her.
Miss Dawson was really upset.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.720
-You witnessed this?
-Well, they were arguing,

19:44.800 --> 19:47.120
and she said one of them was going to
have to leave Millington,

19:47.200 --> 19:49.440
and it wasn't gonna be her.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.640
You know,
she might be a big help.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.000
I'll be in touch
if I have any further questions.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.160
Um, Detective Potter, sir,

20:03.240 --> 20:07.360
has anyone ever told you you'd
look better without the knobs?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.280
Uh... no.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.880
Well, I really think
you should consider it.

20:12.960 --> 20:17.200
Uh, that'll be all, Miss Gold.
Thank you for your time.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.440
The pleasure was mine.

20:29.800 --> 20:33.120
Miss Dawson. I'm Detective Potter.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.200
Please have a seat.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.960
Did you find him?

20:38.240 --> 20:40.320
No, not yet.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.040
So who are you
eavesdropping on this time?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.320
Shh. There's a detective
in there with Miss Dawson.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.600
POTTER:<i> I have it</i>
<i>from more than one source</i>

20:51.680 --> 20:54.240
<i>that you and Mr. Walker</i>
<i>had romantic ties.</i>

20:54.320 --> 20:57.360
-<i>Is that true?</i>
-MISS DAWSON: <i>Yes, it is.</i>

20:57.840 --> 21:00.080
When'd you last see Mr. Walker?

21:00.160 --> 21:01.720
Um...

21:02.960 --> 21:05.400
-Well, yesterday afternoon.
-Mm-hmm.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.160
Did he seem angry?
Was he upset?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.160
He was perfectly fine.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.880
Really? I learned from one
of your students that you had

21:14.960 --> 21:17.400
a significant altercation
with Mr. Walker yesterday

21:17.480 --> 21:20.440
and threatened him
if he did not leave this school.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.600
Is that accurate?

21:24.840 --> 21:28.280
Would you mind coming downtown
with me for further questioning?

21:29.720 --> 21:32.840
Think I'd better contact my lawyer.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.000
Oh, no. That detective thinks
that Miss Dawson has something

21:38.080 --> 21:40.560
to do with Mr. Walker's disappearance,
and it's all my fault.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.240
Don't flatter yourself. She's the
lead suspect, without your big mouth.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.880
The only thing she is guilty of is
loving him. That's definitely a crime.

21:48.520 --> 21:52.000
Why can't you tell it like it is?
She threatened him. We both heard it.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.960
She didn't. She said this school
wasn't big enough for the two of them.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.080
Besides, she's way too petite
to murder anyone.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.440
Well, didn't you ever hear of
Lizzie Borden, the dainty murderess?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.920
I think I've heard of Dizzie Borden.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.640
Look, I don't believe
Miss Dawson killed Mr. Walker.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.200
So who did?

22:08.280 --> 22:11.000
I don't know. Who said he
was murdered? There's no body.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.080
They found his car,
but no Mr. Walker.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.480
Anything could've happened.
He could've been taken hostage.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.160
Okay, Nancy Drew, I think you
been sleuthing around a little too long.

22:20.240 --> 22:24.080
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this,
and it's gonna front-page news.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.000
You don't know the first thing
about Mr. Walker.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.720
I'm the only one who knows him,
much less cares about him.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.640
You know, you're right.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.680
As much as it pains me
to say this, Jack,

22:33.760 --> 22:36.000
I think we should team up
and investigate this thing together.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.640
-(STAMMERING) What's the point of that?
-Two heads are better than one.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.800
Besides, if you help me, I know we can
crack this case wide open.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.360
Are you serious?

22:45.440 --> 22:48.600
Look, if you care about Mr. Walker,
you have a funny way of showing it.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.200
Are you just gonna
sit back and do nothing?

22:56.040 --> 23:00.600
Oh, man. How can someone so
selfish make me feel so guilty?

23:00.680 --> 23:02.520
It's a gift.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.080
Okay, but you gotta promise
not to tell anyone, right?

23:06.160 --> 23:07.840
Relax. Who am I gonna tell?

23:15.360 --> 23:16.920
(HORNS HONKING)

23:27.600 --> 23:29.200
-Oh, I knew it.
-Knew what?

23:29.280 --> 23:33.320
-That you liked him.
-Come on, Jen. This is strictly business.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.160
I told Jack I'd call him tomorrow
with the time we'd meet.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.760
You've got his number?
Mm-hmm. Cute.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.560
LEXY: So, Jen, what do
you know about Jack?

23:42.800 --> 23:46.400
JEN: Not much. I'm not
interested, but you should be.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.560
-LEXY: What?
-Get a clue. He likes you.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.320
That's why he treats you like
a reject from the outlet mall.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.960
-Thanks.
-Oh, come on, I think he's kinda cute.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.840
He's tall, mysterious. Just your type.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.840
That's not possible, Jen.
I don't have a type.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.840
Hey, Dad.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.840
Hey, honey. How was school?

24:10.920 --> 24:13.000
Okay.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.480
So, have you heard
any news about Mr. Walker?

24:15.600 --> 24:17.080
They won't tell us
anything at school.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.760
(SIGHS) Well I did hear they sent
more divers to investigate

24:19.840 --> 24:21.880
the area where
they retrieved his car,

24:21.960 --> 24:25.120
but I don't think they're gonna
find much. There's a strong current.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.840
If you were covering this story,
where would you start?

24:29.560 --> 24:32.040
Well, a good reporter always starts

24:32.120 --> 24:35.000
by looking into the subject's
background for information.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.520
What kind of information?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.360
Anything out of the ordinary,

24:38.560 --> 24:41.320
'cause sometimes when
you compile a lot of facts,

24:41.400 --> 24:44.520
-it leads to answers.
-That sounds like detective work.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.320
Good reporters are like detectives.
But they can't rely on police alone.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.120
They've gotta do
their own investigation.

24:51.200 --> 24:55.080
-Yeah. That really makes sense.
-Hmm. No, wait a minute.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.360
I can see your wheels turning.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.720
Mr. Walker's disappearance
is not a human interest piece, Lexy.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.920
It's a serious case.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.720
Which means I don't
want you to get involved.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.800
Come on, Dad. I was just curious.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.640
Don't worry. <i>Hakuna Matata.</i>

25:23.280 --> 25:26.160
-Who goes there?
-Who do you think?

25:26.240 --> 25:28.040
Be nice or get lost.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.160
May I please come in?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.600
What do you want?

25:43.280 --> 25:46.560
Oh, nothing, really.
I just thought with Mom gone and all,

25:46.640 --> 25:50.320
I'd check on you, see how you're
doing. You know, because I care.

25:50.440 --> 25:55.320
-What do you think, I'm an idiot?
-Well, actually...

25:56.720 --> 25:58.760
I like what you've
done with the place.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.280
But what's all this junk for?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.520
It's not junk. It's important stuff.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.600
This is important?

26:07.480 --> 26:09.280
It's a stealth listening device.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.920
It means secret.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.440
Listen through here.
Put it on your ear.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.480
-(IN EARPIECE)<i> Hey!</i>
-Ow! (SCOFFS)

26:30.440 --> 26:34.320
Pretty cool, huh? And this is my
favorite. It's a wrist walkie-talkie.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.920
You've gotta have it for hands-free
agent-to-agent communication.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.320
So where do you get all
this stuff from, anyway?

26:40.400 --> 26:43.040
-The Corner Spy Shop.
-Never heard of it.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.120
It's right across the street
from where Ma takes her Pilates classes.

26:55.960 --> 26:58.040
This stuff is amazing.

27:05.720 --> 27:09.160
-Hey!
-Look, silly.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.480
Hey, that's cool.
How'd you figure that out?

27:11.560 --> 27:14.040
My dorky sister has
something like it at home.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.440
Can I help you guys?

27:15.520 --> 27:18.520
Uh, yes. We're lookin'
for some spy equipment.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.920
Well you've come to the right place.
Come here. Let me show you something.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.800
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)

27:35.720 --> 27:38.640
Rear-view glasses. Cool.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.400
(SCOFFS)

27:49.440 --> 27:50.760
What's up with this?

27:51.320 --> 27:54.880
Well, I was in the neighborhood,
and I just thought I'd stop by.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.960
-What's he doing here?
-Who?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.960
Oh, him?

28:00.040 --> 28:02.160
Yeah, that would be
the "he" I'm referring to.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.720
Well, there's actually
a really good reason why...

28:04.800 --> 28:08.280
Hear me out, Lexy. Look,
it's only a matter of time

28:08.360 --> 28:11.280
before Dan Rather and
Diane Sawyer show up to cover

28:11.360 --> 28:15.200
Mr. Walker's disappearance, but...
I'm gonna have the exclusive story.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.400
You're gonna have the story?
It's my story.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.360
Hey, what's goin' on?
What are they doin' here?

28:21.440 --> 28:23.800
Yeah, what are
you guys doing here?

28:23.880 --> 28:26.920
In about two seconds,
you both are gonna worship me.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.600
Are you ready? Gabe lives across
the street from Miss Dawson.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.160
And your point is?

28:33.240 --> 28:35.520
Well, if we watch her for a few days

28:35.600 --> 28:37.600
and nothing suspicious takes place,

28:37.680 --> 28:39.480
maybe we can clear her name.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.280
Right, or prove she had something to do
with Walker's disappearance.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.000
-Exactly.
-(SQUEAKING)

28:45.720 --> 28:48.000
Cool camera.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.320
So make yourselves at home, guys.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.240
I'll get the menu book,
and we can order some lunch.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.640
Wow.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.680
So this is how the other half lives.

29:21.480 --> 29:24.840
JEN: Okay, so, um,
what's next, Lex?

29:24.920 --> 29:26.400
(SCOFFS)

29:28.280 --> 29:32.000
Okay, our mission is to identify
any suspicious activity

29:32.080 --> 29:34.080
or clues that might tell us
what happened to Mr. Walker.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.640
JEN: All right.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.320
Even though we have this equipment,

29:37.400 --> 29:40.200
nothing can substitute
for eyes, ears and intuition.

29:40.280 --> 29:43.000
That's right. I think
we should divide and conquer.

29:43.080 --> 29:47.120
Good idea. I propose that Jennifer and I
go to Walker's house to search for clues

29:47.200 --> 29:50.440
while you two go to Gabe's house and
keep watch over Dawson's place.

29:50.560 --> 29:53.640
-Did you get Walker's address?
-Yeah, it's in Carroll Gardens.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.200
That's in Brooklyn.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.000
Brooklyn? I am not
schlepping all the way out to Brooklyn.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.080
Jennifer, a good spy does not
question her assignment.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.800
So what?
I'm not a good spy. I'll live.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.160
I guess I'm going with you.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.080
Oh, I was afraid of that.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.880
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like I'm doing?

30:21.960 --> 30:23.000
Calling a car.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.600
Are you crazy? The big game's tonight.
Traffic's gonna be bumper-to-bumper.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.800
Besides, showing up in a
big hunkin' Richmobile,

30:28.880 --> 30:30.960
we'll stick out
like two sore thumbs.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.000
I say the subway's the only way to go.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.520
Darn! You made me
dial the wrong number.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.960
Right. I made you
dial the wrong number.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.680
(BUSY SIGNAL)

30:42.920 --> 30:45.400
You've never been on
the subway before, have you?

30:46.160 --> 30:47.520
(SCOFFS)

30:47.600 --> 30:50.720
Please! Of course I have.
I take it all the time.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.920
Uh-huh. So let's go.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Lexy!

31:34.200 --> 31:36.440
Jen, come on up.

31:43.480 --> 31:46.600
Okay, this is so not a photo op.

31:53.800 --> 31:54.880
Okay, come on. Let's go.

31:54.960 --> 31:58.040
Hold on, I'm just making
some technical adjustments.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.680
All right.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.080
Okay.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.440
Wow, this is some library.

32:29.760 --> 32:34.360
Huh? Oh, yeah, it's my,
uh, lifetime collection.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.560
"Gabe's Birth"?

32:36.680 --> 32:39.280
You mean, you even
have that on tape?

32:39.360 --> 32:42.160
Oh, yeah actually. My dad just
got me started really young,

32:42.240 --> 32:45.200
-and I've been recording things since.
-Impressive.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.440
Okay.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.640
Everything's about set up.

33:03.240 --> 33:07.840
-And... Action.
-Oh, this is so exciting.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.320
Maybe she's not home.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.000
Yeah, yeah, you...

33:21.080 --> 33:24.840
You just have to sit
and wait and... Yeah.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.680
Yes, I made it.
I can't wait to tell Jennifer.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.560
Wow.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.240
How interesting.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.440
What a riot. I mean, who knew?

34:00.720 --> 34:03.040
Okay. It's this way.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.880
Uh, actually, it's this way.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.880
Pardon me, but do you see
this paper in my hands?

34:08.960 --> 34:10.760
It's called a map,
and according to it,

34:10.840 --> 34:12.840
-Mr. Walker's house is that way.
-Right.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.840
Well, you know, first of all...

34:15.360 --> 34:17.720
Here you go. And second
of all, it's that way.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.440
I've been there before.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.440
Look! She's home.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.640
JEN: I love this exercise tape!

34:54.000 --> 34:57.960
Are you crazy?
She might be a murderer.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.560
I feel like a store mannequin.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.160
You mean like a dummy on display.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.800
Uh, excuse us, sir.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.000
Hey, didn't that man's coat
look like the one

35:25.080 --> 35:26.800
that Mr. Walker used to wear?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.840
I don't know. I didn't notice.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.840
LEXY: <i>I'm sure that was</i>
<i>Mr. Walker's coat.</i>

35:34.920 --> 35:38.800
<i>I mean, how many of those hideous</i>
<i>green frocks could there be in one city?</i>

35:41.880 --> 35:43.600
Yeah, at the beginning
of the school year,

35:43.680 --> 35:46.960
I came here to pick up Mr. Walker's
old computer. He was giving it to me.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.400
That's it right there.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.680
MAN: Okay, I'll call you later.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.680
-Oh, my gosh. Look!
-It's Miss Stern.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.760
I'm surprised she
doesn't have a nosebleed

35:57.880 --> 36:00.240
from being south of 14th Street.

36:00.520 --> 36:03.600
-Funny, you don't have a nosebleed.
-Ha-ha.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.440
What's Miss Stern
doing at Mr. Walker's?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.200
Wait a minute. I did see them

36:11.280 --> 36:14.080
having a weird conversation
the day before he disappeared.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.800
-Yeah?
-Well, that's sort of suspicious.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
Suspicious of what?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.640
I don't know.
I'm just pointing it out.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.720
Let's, uh, check out Mr. Walker's.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.440
Should we go in?

36:52.280 --> 36:55.080
Well, we, uh, came all
the way over here, didn't we?

37:27.160 --> 37:29.880
It's as if he were just here.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.160
You know, I really like
this sleuthing thing.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.920
I think I could be pretty good at it.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.840
(CAT SHRIEKS, GLASS BREAKS, DOG BARKS)

37:44.920 --> 37:46.800
Uh, okay, I'm scared. Let's go.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.560
Hey, whoa, we just got here.
Let's look around a litlle bit.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.440
Right.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.120
Look at this. "N.P."

38:00.440 --> 38:02.720
I wonder what that stands for.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.000
(SCREAMING)

38:41.280 --> 38:43.560
(SNORING)

39:00.200 --> 39:02.320
Gabe, look! Gabe.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.240
Who is that?

39:35.640 --> 39:37.680
BOTH: Mr. Goldblum?

39:39.360 --> 39:41.600
Detective Meany.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.920
And you two are
on private property.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.160
Do you realize
that's against the law?

39:47.280 --> 39:50.360
-No. No, sir.
-No, we didn't. Of course not.

39:50.440 --> 39:54.680
It is. Now who are you,
and what are you doing here?

39:55.040 --> 39:57.440
I'm Lexy Gold
and this is Jack Downey.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.960
We're students of Mr. Walker's.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.280
Is he alive, sir?

40:01.360 --> 40:04.160
That's... Police business,

40:04.240 --> 40:07.160
but if you know anything
about his disappearance,

40:07.240 --> 40:09.840
I suggest you tell me now.

40:10.280 --> 40:13.600
Oh, (STAMMERING) we don't...
we don't know anything, sir.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.000
Are you absolutely
positive about that?

40:17.520 --> 40:21.240
(STAMMERING) Of course we're
absolutely positive about that.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.640
Hmm.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.960
Do you have the time?

40:26.840 --> 40:29.880
Yeah, it's, uh...
It's half past 3: 00.

40:29.960 --> 40:33.400
How long have you been doing
this? You know, police work?

40:33.480 --> 40:37.120
Did you say it's half past 3: 00?
'Cause we're late for dinner.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.480
It's a little early
for dinner, isn't it, Jack?

40:40.240 --> 40:43.680
Well, did you know that it's better
to eat big meals early in the day?

40:43.760 --> 40:48.720
-It's good for your digestive system.
-No. I didn't know that.

40:49.360 --> 40:52.400
So, uh, we gotta get
all the way across town...

40:52.480 --> 40:55.040
Uh, so, we, we got to go.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.160
Well, I guess we'll be
seeing you, detective.

40:58.240 --> 41:02.280
Right. Uh, so, we-we
gotta go. Uh, goodbye.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.040
Have you completely lost your mind?

41:08.120 --> 41:10.880
I've never seen this side of
you. You're scared, aren't you?

41:10.960 --> 41:15.000
I'm not scared. I didn't wanna upset
the detective. He seemed kinda strange.

41:15.120 --> 41:19.440
-That's because he was not a detective.
-What? And you know this because?

41:19.520 --> 41:22.160
Because a New York detective
could never afford

41:22.240 --> 41:24.360
a platinum watch, a Pumoni suit
and alligator boots.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.440
Huh? A private detective
can have wealthy clients

41:28.520 --> 41:30.360
and tons of money,
especially in New York.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.040
Maybe, maybe not.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.120
Besides, how can you tell
a Pumoni suit from across the room?

41:35.200 --> 41:37.800
Trust me, I can spot
a knockoff from a mile away.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.640
And that was the real thing.
Same with the watch. The best.

41:40.720 --> 41:44.040
Fine platinum band with 18-carat accents
and mother-of-pearl dials

41:44.120 --> 41:47.000
that allow you to check the time in
any two time zones simultaneously.

41:47.080 --> 41:51.160
It's the ultimate in chic. Just call it
my New York sensibility hard at work.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.520
Wow, who'd of thought that your
insane obsession with material objects

41:54.600 --> 41:57.760
-would actually come in handy?
-I'll take that as a compliment.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.880
Hey, do you think that
Miss Stern and this Meany guy

42:00.960 --> 42:02.680
are in on something together?

42:02.760 --> 42:04.960
I don't know, but let's
run a check on him.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.640
Good idea. We'll go back to my house.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.240
Nah, we're going to my place.
It's right here.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.440
You live in Brooklyn?
Why didn't you say so?

42:20.200 --> 42:23.120
No one ever asked. Everyone
assumes if you go to Millington,

42:23.200 --> 42:25.520
you have a doorman and
a summer house and all that.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.080
We don't have any of that.
I'm at Millington on a scholarship.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.040
Really?

42:30.560 --> 42:31.920
Hi, Mrs. Jenrette.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.880
-Hi, Jack.
-Yeah, really.

42:34.960 --> 42:38.080
Look, Brooklyn's not fancy
like the Upper East Side, okay?

42:38.160 --> 42:40.480
I like it here. Everybody's cool.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.360
Like, I bet you don't know
your neighbors, right?

42:43.440 --> 42:46.240
Well, we don't really have neighbors,
'cause we own the whole floor.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.680
But I did meet the people below us
when I overflowed the bathtub once.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.920
Right. Overflowed
the bathtub. Come on.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.840
Hey, Ma, I'm home!

43:00.920 --> 43:03.000
MRS. DOWNEY: Hello.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.320
What's your mom doing home
in the middle of the day?

43:08.400 --> 43:10.160
She's an emergency-room nurse.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.920
She works the night shift.
She's got the days off.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.680
Really?

43:15.600 --> 43:17.640
Something smells amazing.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.720
Yeah, she's a great cook.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.320
-She cooks?
-Yeah. Come on.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.680
-Hello.
-Hi, Ma.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.520
Uh, this is my friend
Lexy from school.

43:33.600 --> 43:36.200
Hello, Lexy.
Nice to meet you.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.600
You, too, Mrs. Downey.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.200
I'm running a little behind, Jack.
Would you do the dishes later?

43:40.280 --> 43:41.600
Yeah, sure, Ma.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.360
Would you like a lemon square?

43:44.440 --> 43:46.120
Mmm.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.720
-This is delicious.
-Thank you.

43:50.800 --> 43:53.360
So, what are
you two working on?

43:53.480 --> 43:55.920
-Uh, it's just a...
-School project.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.440
A school project. Right.
So we'll be upstairs.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.200
Oh, all right.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.720
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you, Lexy.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.480
You, too.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.200
That's my brother.

44:24.200 --> 44:27.360
-You have a brother?
-Yeah, that's Todd.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.360
-Does he live here?
-Nah.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.160
-Where is he?
-He's in the navy.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.960
Oh, really?

44:35.120 --> 44:37.600
Yeah. He's, uh,
stationed in Hawaii.

44:37.680 --> 44:40.600
It's so wonderful there.
The Grand Makiki is to die for.

44:40.680 --> 44:43.040
I had the best facial ever,
last time I was there.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.120
What's your favorite island?

44:45.680 --> 44:48.760
I wouldn't know.
I've never been to Hawaii.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.160
Oh.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.480
Todd and I used to share
this room before he went away.

45:01.560 --> 45:05.720
-You must miss him.
-Yeah, I do.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.840
So where's your dad?

45:09.320 --> 45:11.680
Well, he, he died
a couple years ago.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.800
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry, Jack.

45:13.880 --> 45:16.560
No, it's okay. Well,
he was sick for a long time,

45:16.760 --> 45:18.400
but we took
good care of him.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.120
Must've been really hard.

45:21.440 --> 45:25.840
It, uh... It was really okay.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.240
I loved my dad.

45:32.360 --> 45:35.920
Yeah, uh, let's
check out Meany, huh?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.640
Here.

45:42.120 --> 45:45.520
So, what are all
these trophies for?

45:45.600 --> 45:47.440
I like to bowl.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.360
I hear that you have to wear shoes
that other people have worn.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.120
Well, you know, real bowlers
have their own shoes.

45:53.200 --> 45:56.280
I'm not quite sure, but I think they have
their own socks and underwear too.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.480
But that's the really good bowlers.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.160
Is this the computer
that Mr. Walker gave you?

46:02.240 --> 46:05.720
-Mm-hmm.
-I can see why. It's ancient.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.840
It looks like there's
a Charles Meany licensed

46:12.960 --> 46:14.960
as a New York State
private detective.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.480
Well, there could be
more than one Charles Meany,

46:17.560 --> 46:19.280
or he could be lying.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.840
Or this could be
the Charles Meany we met today.

46:21.920 --> 46:23.800
It could be.

46:29.240 --> 46:33.000
-That's not possible.
-What's not possible?

46:33.600 --> 46:35.360
I have an e-mail.

46:35.440 --> 46:39.640
Oh, yes, that is a surprise,
but you must have some friends.

46:39.720 --> 46:41.720
Who's it from?

46:41.800 --> 46:43.880
It's from Mr. Walker.

46:43.960 --> 46:47.560
What? Wait a minute.
Hold on. What is that?

46:48.680 --> 46:50.560
It's a letter of
recommendation he promised

46:50.640 --> 46:52.960
for my Millington
scholarship renewal.

46:54.560 --> 46:57.240
This is so weird. The letter itself
was dated four days ago,

46:57.320 --> 46:59.920
but it wasn't sent until yesterday.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.560
LEXY: How does
a dead man send e-mail?

47:05.360 --> 47:07.400
-Hey Lexy, I just thought of something.
-What?

47:07.480 --> 47:11.480
-Well, this was Mr. Walker's computer.
-Yeah.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.960
Look at this.
"Nicholas Petrossian." N.P.

47:19.040 --> 47:22.080
The initials on the briefcase
at Mr. Walker's house.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.400
(BEEPING)

47:37.560 --> 47:40.320
Lexy's paging us to meet her
back at her place.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.760
And watching Miss Dawson
was getting so good.

47:43.880 --> 47:46.840
Okay, I'd better leave the camera
running so we can check it out later.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.560
See if anything happens.

47:52.800 --> 47:56.480
Whoa, so Mr. Walker's real
name is Nicholas Petrossian?

47:56.560 --> 47:59.560
Well, you can't blame him
for changing a name like that.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.880
-Hey, you think I could change my name?
-Sure, why not?

48:01.960 --> 48:04.400
Okay, you guys,
let's review today's developments.

48:04.480 --> 48:06.840
Now, we saw Miss Stern
leave Mr. Walker...

48:06.920 --> 48:08.960
I mean, Petrossian's apartment
in Brooklyn,

48:09.040 --> 48:11.880
where a dubious detective
claimed to be "on the case."

48:11.960 --> 48:13.920
Mr. Goldblum was leaving
Miss Dawson's apartment.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.400
And some homeless guy in Brooklyn
was wearing Mr. Walker's jacket.

48:17.480 --> 48:20.480
That is so bizarre.
Oh, what was Miss Stern wearing?

48:20.720 --> 48:22.400
It was hard to tell.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.280
Excuse me. Who cares?

48:24.360 --> 48:26.400
-Can we continue?
-JEN: (SCOFFS) Whatever.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.880
-Go right ahead.
-Okay.

48:28.960 --> 48:31.680
We don't know why Miss Stern
was at Mr. Walker's apartment.

48:31.760 --> 48:35.800
Let's not forget she had an argument
with Mr. Walker before he disappeared.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.600
-GABE: Yeah.
-Totally fishy.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.640
My thought exactly, Jen.
Now, this detective, it was...

48:40.720 --> 48:42.680
Well, what's wrong with him?

48:42.760 --> 48:45.480
Well, nothing really.
He was just sort of creepy,

48:45.560 --> 48:47.840
and he dressed way too
flashy to be a detective.

48:47.920 --> 48:50.680
You know, Cameron Diaz dressed pretty
flashy in<i> Charlie's Angels.</i>

48:50.760 --> 48:52.600
(GABE LAUGHS)

48:52.680 --> 48:54.440
Jen...

48:56.320 --> 49:00.320
Okay. So it looks like
Mr. Goldblum is somehow, uh...

49:01.080 --> 49:03.120
Involved with Miss Dawson?

49:03.200 --> 49:05.520
But just yesterday,
Mr. Walker broke her heart.

49:05.600 --> 49:09.040
-And then she threatened him.
-Juicy, isn't it?

49:10.400 --> 49:14.040
Maybe Mr. Goldblum and Dawson
conspired to get rid of Walker.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.160
But what's their motive?
Because he was at Dawson's house...

49:17.240 --> 49:20.360
With his arm around her.
Mm-hmm.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.440
He was jealous.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.920
But how do we explain
this homeless guy?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.200
I don't know, but there
can't be more than one

49:28.320 --> 49:30.400
hideous Aussie coat
like that in New York City.

49:30.480 --> 49:32.040
Come on, maybe the guy just found it.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.520
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

49:34.600 --> 49:37.400
-No way.
-What you got here, Jack?

49:37.480 --> 49:41.720
I ran a search on the name Petrossian, and
this came up in<i> The Arizona Dispatch.</i>

49:41.800 --> 49:44.880
"Nicholas Petrossian, a banker,
mysteriously disappeared,

49:44.960 --> 49:46.960
"and there's evidence to indicate
that he may be dead.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.440
"Just recently, he was charged
with fraud and embezzlement."

49:49.520 --> 49:53.680
JACK: "Petrossian is survived by his
mother who resides in Brighton Beach."

49:53.760 --> 49:55.680
I say we pay her a visit.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.600
Sure. I'll work on
getting her address.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.600
(BELL RINGING)

50:02.200 --> 50:06.040
You should have seen my outfit. It was
so cute that everyone stared at me.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.600
I wore these adorable
black Capri pants

50:08.680 --> 50:11.880
with this leopard-print T-shirt
and these chunky shoes...

50:11.960 --> 50:14.760
LEXY: <i>Hmm. Maybe I've</i>
<i>underestimated Jack all this time.</i>

50:14.840 --> 50:17.400
<i>I mean, there's a lot more</i>
<i>to him than I thought.</i>

50:17.480 --> 50:20.280
<i>It must be hard for him to go</i>
<i>to school so far from home.</i>

50:20.360 --> 50:22.760
<i>And with his brother gone</i>
<i>and his dad...</i>

50:22.840 --> 50:27.040
<i>I don't know what I'd do without my dad.</i>
<i>But his mom's really sweet.</i>

50:27.120 --> 50:30.160
I'd call them your classic
Mary-Janes, with thick soles,

50:30.240 --> 50:33.880
a Velcro strap and square toes.
Your basic Prada knockoffs.

50:33.960 --> 50:37.800
LEXY:<i> He always seems to be alone.</i>
<i>I wonder who his best friend is.</i>

50:37.880 --> 50:40.480
<i>I really like</i>
<i>spending time with Jack.</i>

50:40.560 --> 50:43.000
<i>(EXCLAIMS) Oh, my gosh!</i>
<i>What am I saying?</i>

50:43.080 --> 50:44.880
-JACK: I got it.
-JEN: What?

50:44.960 --> 50:46.760
Mrs. Petrossian's address.

50:46.840 --> 50:48.800
Are you serious?
How'd you do that?

50:48.880 --> 50:51.960
I used a little Brooklyn common
sense. I checked the phone book.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.480
-No way.
-Way.

50:54.560 --> 50:56.760
Yeah, she was listed
in the white pages.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.920
I think we should
go after school.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.760
-Okay.
-All right.

51:02.720 --> 51:05.240
-I knew it.
-What?

51:05.320 --> 51:07.360
Oh, come on, Jen. This is work.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.920
-You mean, it's working.
-What's working?

51:10.000 --> 51:12.160
You so like Jack.
Can't you just admit it?

51:35.880 --> 51:37.880
That's it right over there.

51:37.960 --> 51:40.680
Oh, how cute!
They have a wishing well.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.920
Hi. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.360
We're looking for the mother
of a Nicholas Petrossian.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.360
There's no one here by that name.

52:01.440 --> 52:04.640
It's not really a name you forget.
Maybe if you give it some thought...

52:04.720 --> 52:06.200
I'm sorry.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.320
-MAN: Let 'em in.
-What are you thinking?

52:08.400 --> 52:10.520
-They're okay, Mom.
-Don't do this.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.120
BOTH: Mr. Walker!

52:14.760 --> 52:16.640
Come on.

52:17.320 --> 52:21.000
Would you care for something?
The eel is wonderful.

52:21.080 --> 52:25.160
Very fresh. I'd say it was
swimming around just this morning.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.520
Oh, no, thank you.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.080
-Hmm?
-I just ate.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.800
Okay.

52:30.880 --> 52:32.560
Yeah.

52:36.680 --> 52:38.560
That's a stunning
pendant you're wearing.

52:38.640 --> 52:41.800
Oh, yeah? Well, thank you.

52:41.880 --> 52:45.720
Years ago, I found it in
a little junk shop outside Reno.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.960
I bought it with
the nickels I won on the slots.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.840
I can't believe
you're alive, Mr. Walker.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.720
We were thinking the worst.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.080
Yeah, what's going on,
Mr. Walker?

52:56.160 --> 52:58.040
Well, it's complicated.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.840
I tried to talk him out of this,

53:00.920 --> 53:03.480
but he's just as
stubborn as his father was.

53:03.560 --> 53:06.080
You don't want
to get me started.

53:06.160 --> 53:08.760
-Thank you, Mom.
-Yeah.

53:10.720 --> 53:13.080
So do you wanna fill us in on
the fraud and embezzlement

53:13.160 --> 53:16.680
you were charged with in '87?
We found out about that.

53:16.800 --> 53:20.040
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
You've always done your homework.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.880
But I'm not guilty. I was framed.

53:23.240 --> 53:26.560
Oh, you can say that again.

53:28.320 --> 53:33.200
MR. WALKER: <i>Back in the '80s,</i>
<i>I was a young, eager banker in Arizona,</i>

53:33.280 --> 53:36.880
<i>working hard, trying to claw</i>
<i>my way up the corporate ladder.</i>

53:36.960 --> 53:40.160
<i>I had just landed a really big,</i>
<i>important account,</i>

53:40.240 --> 53:43.680
<i>and everyone started taking</i>
<i>notice, especially Granville.</i>

53:43.760 --> 53:46.080
<i>I was on top of the world.</i>

53:46.200 --> 53:47.800
Gentlemen!

53:47.880 --> 53:49.800
LEXY: <i>Who's Granville?</i>

53:49.880 --> 53:51.360
WALKER: <i>Oh, he was my boss.</i>

53:51.440 --> 53:53.440
MRS. WALKER:
<i>I never liked that man.</i>

53:53.520 --> 53:56.280
WALKER:<i> Mother, please.</i>

53:56.360 --> 53:58.960
Aces!

53:59.040 --> 54:01.520
WALKER: <i>Well, it was</i>
<i>short-lived, anyway.</i>

54:01.600 --> 54:03.080
<i>Very soon after,</i>

54:03.160 --> 54:06.040
<i>somebody stole $10 million</i>
<i>out of that new account</i>

54:06.120 --> 54:09.480
<i>and put it into</i>
<i>a foreign account in my name.</i>

54:09.720 --> 54:12.080
I was framed for the theft.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.600
Why didn't you withdraw it
and turn it to the police?

54:14.680 --> 54:17.880
Well, I immediately went to do
that, but the account was empty.

54:19.800 --> 54:22.120
And you never found out
who framed you?

54:22.560 --> 54:25.760
No. Lots of people
had access to the account.

54:26.280 --> 54:29.520
What about the money?
No idea where it went?

54:29.600 --> 54:33.160
Not a clue.
I sure wish I did, though.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.400
How does $10 million
just disappear?

54:40.200 --> 54:43.320
WALKER:<i> I knew that the police</i>
<i>would soon show up, so I ran,</i>

54:43.400 --> 54:46.440
<i>but someone came after me</i>
<i>and stalked me for months,</i>

54:46.520 --> 54:48.760
<i>leaving me</i>
<i>threatening messages,</i>

54:48.840 --> 54:51.760
<i>accusing me of robbing</i>
<i>the foreign account.</i>

54:51.840 --> 54:53.680
MRS. WALKER: <i>Someday,</i>
<i>the person who did this</i>

54:53.760 --> 54:55.800
is gonna get a piece of my mind.

54:55.880 --> 54:59.160
He's gonna regret
the day he was born.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.680
It was a nightmare. (SIGHS)

55:03.200 --> 55:06.960
I had to take drastic action,
and I faked my own death

55:07.040 --> 55:10.000
in order to shake off my pursuer.

55:10.080 --> 55:13.040
Nicholas Petrossian was <i>kaput.</i>

55:13.160 --> 55:15.360
And you created a whole new you.

55:16.440 --> 55:19.360
Yeah.
Uh, Orlando Walker was a teacher

55:19.440 --> 55:21.680
who had died the year
before I came to town.

55:21.760 --> 55:25.480
When I acquired his identity,
I became a teacher too.

55:25.560 --> 55:29.440
And I loved it, you know?
And I settled into my new life and...

55:29.520 --> 55:31.960
Things went back to normal.

55:34.400 --> 55:39.440
-Then I met Miss Dawson.
-Oh, she's the bee's knees.

55:39.520 --> 55:42.240
-Egg salad?
-Pumpernickel.

55:42.320 --> 55:44.640
BOTH: My favorite!

55:47.040 --> 55:50.200
I went head over heels.
And everything was going great

55:50.280 --> 55:52.400
until Lexy's article
appeared in the newspaper.

55:52.480 --> 55:56.000
Oh, my gosh. It looks like you were found
because of my picture.

55:56.080 --> 56:00.000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Walker. I never
had any intentions of hurting you.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.680
I know you didn't, Lexy.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.920
Anyway, that afternoon,
I felt somebody was following me.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.040
And when I got home,
I found this note.

56:12.040 --> 56:14.720
It had rained
and the ink smudged,

56:14.800 --> 56:17.440
so it's hard to read.

56:20.320 --> 56:22.240
JACK: "I know who you are.

56:22.920 --> 56:24.840
"Under the palm...

56:24.920 --> 56:28.320
"Lobby at... Hotel,
Saturday... At 2 p.m.

56:28.400 --> 56:32.040
"You'll pay. If you don't pay,
your girlfriend will."

56:34.280 --> 56:36.400
You're being blackmailed,
Mr. Walker.

56:36.480 --> 56:40.320
It looks like you're supposed to show up
at some hotel on Saturday at 2 p.m.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.280
If you don't, something
might happen to Miss Dawson.

56:42.360 --> 56:44.720
And I have to figure out
what hotel that is.

56:44.800 --> 56:49.360
-Do you know who wrote this note?
-Whoever framed me way back when.

56:49.440 --> 56:54.280
We can't assume anyone is innocent until
we have this mystery person cornered.

56:55.280 --> 56:57.760
So if we find out what lobby
we're supposed to be at,

56:57.840 --> 57:00.160
-we can find the mystery person.
-Yes, and I need to be there

57:00.240 --> 57:01.920
so that no harm comes to Miss Dawson.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.640
Well, Mr. Walker, you have
to come out in the open some time.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.680
If you don't, how are you
ever gonna marry Miss Dawson?

57:10.560 --> 57:15.120
-I'd love to marry her.
-Oh, that's so sweet!

57:15.680 --> 57:17.400
Well, we need to find out
which hotel it is,

57:17.480 --> 57:19.480
and then we can just use you as bait.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.280
What are you doing here?

57:25.360 --> 57:29.400
I live here, you geek. I mean,
may I please have a moment?

57:29.840 --> 57:32.480
The suspense is killing me.
What do you want?

57:32.560 --> 57:36.120
Out of the kindness of my heart,
I've decided to clue you in.

57:36.840 --> 57:38.720
Come on.

57:42.320 --> 57:44.240
Anything on the disk?

57:44.320 --> 57:45.920
Just air.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.080
BOTH: Let's go to work.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.480
LEXY: "I know who you are. Meet
me under the palm in the lobby

58:39.560 --> 58:43.320
"at the Fairmark Hotel,
Saturday at 2 p.m."

58:43.400 --> 58:46.120
-The Fairmark!
-Oh, yes!

58:46.200 --> 58:48.400
-MR. GOLD: Kids, you in there?
-TAYLOR: Dad!

58:50.640 --> 58:52.480
Hey, what's going on?

58:52.560 --> 58:54.480
-Oh, hi, Dad.
-Mr. Gold.

58:54.560 --> 58:55.760
What are you guys doing?

58:55.840 --> 58:58.720
-Um... Yeah.
-Just learning some new dance steps.

58:58.800 --> 59:02.280
It's shuffle-ball-change,
Taylor, not change-ball-shuffle.

59:02.400 --> 59:04.960
-You're such an idiot.
-I know you really are.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.840
Okay, well, uh,
I'm going to go

59:06.920 --> 59:08.800
and prepare for
tomorrow's assignment.

59:08.880 --> 59:11.440
-Bye, Dad!
-Love you.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.680
Okay, let's get
ahold of Mr. Walker.

59:13.760 --> 59:17.000
Now. We just need to stake out
the Fairmark at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

59:24.480 --> 59:25.920
Hi, Dad. Bye, Dad.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.760
-Hold up, honey.
-What's up?

59:27.840 --> 59:31.720
There's been some troubling
developments concerning Mr. Walker.

59:31.840 --> 59:34.280
"Police today have announced
that missing schoolteacher,

59:34.360 --> 59:38.120
"Orlando Walker, may be a wanted
embezzler, in hiding since 1987.

59:38.440 --> 59:40.320
"A spokesperson for
the police department says

59:40.400 --> 59:43.520
"that Walker faces many years
of prison if convicted.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.640
"A sizable reward has
been posted for information

59:46.720 --> 59:48.560
"regarding Mr. Walker's whereabouts."

59:48.640 --> 59:50.280
-Oh, my gosh.
-I'm sorry, honey.

59:50.400 --> 59:53.200
You can't always
tell a book by its cover.

59:53.280 --> 59:56.520
Well, does it say there
if anyone knows where he is?

59:56.600 --> 59:59.000
No. Apparently, he's still missing.

59:59.080 --> 1:00:02.000
Great! I mean, I'm late.
I gotta go, Dad.

1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:04.560
-Have a nice day. Bye, Gilda!
-Bye, dear!

1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:06.640
-Lexy!
-Yeah?

1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:08.880
I thought you could
use these walkie-talkies.

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.760
I picked up some extras.

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:13.200
That's a great idea,
but are you sure?

1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:15.360
You may need them.

1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:18.160
Thanks.

1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:20.640
Good luck.

1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:23.640
You know, I just may keep you.

1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:25.920
Bye.

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:21.400
Okay. Are you ready?

1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:59.360
I think those kids are up to no good.

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:02.040
GABE: Hmm. That looks
pretty good over there.

1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:04.480
Oh! Come on, Gabe.

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:20.200
(CLOCK CHIMES)

1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:22.720
It's 2: 00!
Can you stand this? It's 2:00!

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:25.040
Okay, guys. Places.

1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:54.800
No, not Miss Dawson.
I left her a message to lie low,

1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:56.960
but she probably didn't understand.

1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:04.840
No. Don't do it, Mr. Walker.

1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:26.640
(GASPS) It's Mr. Goldblum!

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:28.440
What?

1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:38.680
Or not.

1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:46.520
(GRUNTING)

1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:49.920
LEXY: It's that homeless
guy with Mr. Walker's coat.

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.280
And look! Mrs. P?

1:03:57.720 --> 1:03:59.800
It's Miss Stern!

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:03.400
Is she meeting Mr. Goldblum?

1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:16.240
I'm confused.

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:19.280
Okay, are we on some new
TV show with hidden cameras?

1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:21.320
JEN: Lexy.

1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:24.000
I don't care what the prizes are.
This is just getting too insane.

1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:25.520
-Lexy!
-What?

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:30.240
Meany!

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:35.120
Petrossian.

1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:38.040
Granville. I...

1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:41.160
I can't believe it's you.
You, you did this to me? Why?

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:44.960
I was your best employee,
your, your toughest deal maker.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:47.880
I never did believe
you were a dead man.

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:51.080
You ruined my life. For all
intents and purposes, I am dead.

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:54.240
(CHUCKLES) Well,
I must say, for a dead man,

1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:56.760
you certainly seem
to be enjoying yourself.

1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:01.160
(SCOFFS) Right. Enjoy living my
life on the run. You set me up.

1:05:01.640 --> 1:05:04.040
(CHUCKLES) Of course I did, old boy.

1:05:04.120 --> 1:05:06.120
You're such an easy mark.

1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:09.280
Why not make it easy
on yourself now and...

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.080
Hand it over?

1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:12.760
I don't have the money.

1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:16.240
Well, of course you don't have
the money, you fool. Just...

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:18.120
Just give me what belongs to me.

1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:20.760
Don't go there, Mr. Walker.

1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:22.560
Just trap him.

1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:27.120
To make you go away, I'll give
you... Half of it right now.

1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:29.040
Half.

1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:31.400
Half?

1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:33.400
What are you
talking about, you fool?

1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.840
-(FEEDBACK)
-Ow!

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:37.920
Who sent you?

1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:41.920
Ow! Aah! Oh! Ow!

1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:45.320
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. It's just my ankle.

1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:48.560
Don't let him get away! Oh!

1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:53.920
Okay. You two go up,
and Jack and I will go down.

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:04.800
(PANTING)

1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:15.960

1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:26.600
What the...

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:49.920
There he is. Come on!

1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:03.560
-(LEXY SCREAMS)
-JACK: Look out!

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:23.520
Let's get out of here!

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:24.960
Oh!

1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:27.960
Jack! Jack, I'm stuck!

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:31.840

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.760
Jack!

1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:42.400
Come on!

1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:51.720
Wow. Thank you, Jack.

1:07:57.320 --> 1:07:58.920
Uh, come on.

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:06.280
Which way do we go?

(MUFFLED SCREAM)

1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:45.680
Oh, my gosh.
Miss Dawson! Are you okay?

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:49.000
Oof, talk about
a fashion emergency.

1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:53.520
I receive an exclusive invitation

1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:57.680
for a free day at the spa,
and this is what it gets me.

1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:00.520
What in the world
is going on here?

1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:02.920
What are you doing here?

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.800
Well, it's a long story.

1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:08.000
-But, for starters, Mr. Walker's alive.
-What?

1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:10.520
Well, you're gonna flip
when you hear the details,

1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:12.080
but they're going to have to wait.

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:14.240
Right now, we have to 86 Granville.

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:18.800
He's the guy that issued this
oh-so-exclusive invitation.

1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:21.120
Oh, Miss Dawson.

1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:36.960
Forgive me for hosing you down
like this, but I've gotta go.

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:39.120

-Oh!
-(SCREAMS)

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:11.360
Are you okay?

1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:27.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet, please.

1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:29.880
May I have your attention?

1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:32.280
Thank you.

1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:35.840
I am pleased to introduce someone

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:38.040
who has spent the last four weeks

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:42.560
living undercover as a homeless
man on the streets of Brooklyn.

1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:46.320
He's here today
to tell us his story.

1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:52.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
city council member Gary Eikare.

1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.200
-(CROWD GASPS, APPLAUDS)
-(WOMAN) All right, Gary!

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:12.600
I am proud

1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:15.680
to stand before you
today as a man

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:20.480
with some small insight into
the poverty on our streets.

1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:24.040
Do you see this old coat?

1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:29.280
To some, a coat
is merely an accessory,

1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:31.200
a fashion statement.

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:34.840
To others, a coat

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:37.040
is a form of shelter.

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:39.040
A means of survival.

1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:43.680
This dreary old coat

1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:47.040
is practically the only
offering of kindness

1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:49.120
I received in the past month.

1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:53.840
A man literally took it
off his back... To keep me warm.

1:11:58.200 --> 1:11:59.840
(WOMAN) Good job!

1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:04.600
That rag, a form of shelter?
Never thought of it that way.

1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:07.560
Well, there's
a first time for everything.

1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:10.880
Hey, come on.

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:12.840

-Ma'am?
-Oh, get me a cold one, <i>gar√ßon.</i>

1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:26.640
Right away.

1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:30.280
Oh!

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:35.200

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:40.040
-Mr. Walker!
-Have you seen Miss Dawson?

1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:43.360
Um... Oh, there she is.

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:51.720
Hello!

1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:00.000
Oh.
