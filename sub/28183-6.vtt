WEBVTT

00:11.968 --> 00:14.236
Why are marble floors so expensive

00:14.270 --> 00:17.039
but marbles are, like, super cheap?

00:17.073 --> 00:18.774
I actually don't know
how much marbles cost.

00:18.808 --> 00:20.269
Why am I here, again?

00:20.294 --> 00:21.328
We're going into a negotiation

00:21.353 --> 00:22.872
with one of the best litigators
in the country...

00:22.872 --> 00:23.872
Phillip Kaws. Yep.

00:23.907 --> 00:26.141
Saw his name on the door
<i>and</i> the building.

00:26.175 --> 00:27.309
And he's, like, super famous.

00:27.343 --> 00:28.410
Why am <i>I</i> here?

00:28.444 --> 00:30.112
You're here because Kaws is
gonna try to intimidate us

00:30.146 --> 00:31.780
by packing this room
with an army of attorneys.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.282
So I'm a seat filler.

00:33.316 --> 00:34.650
No, we just need you to sit with us

00:34.684 --> 00:36.184
so our side doesn't look so empty.

00:36.219 --> 00:38.053
That is literally
exactly what a seat filler does.

00:38.087 --> 00:39.133
What's the case?

00:39.167 --> 00:40.222
Please do not distract me.

00:40.256 --> 00:41.623
This is why I came back from Texas...

00:41.658 --> 00:43.692
to go up against legends
like Phillip Kaws.

00:43.726 --> 00:45.350
- This is my moment.
- Stop.

00:45.385 --> 00:47.664
Okay, maybe "This is my moment" was a
little over-the-top, but it felt...

00:47.698 --> 00:48.844
No, I mean, yes, that was insane,

00:48.878 --> 00:50.065
but that's not what I'm talking about.

00:50.099 --> 00:51.099
We are colleagues,

00:51.134 --> 00:53.235
and I am taking time away
from my busy caseload

00:53.269 --> 00:54.236
to help you out.

00:54.270 --> 00:55.270
What is the case?

00:55.305 --> 00:57.372
We're negotiating
the surrender of Isaiah West,

00:57.407 --> 00:58.373
huge real-estate developer.

00:58.408 --> 01:00.542
Yeah, I know. His name
is on buildings, too.

01:00.576 --> 01:03.345
Seems like a great guy.
He was just on "The View."

01:03.379 --> 01:04.578
What? I like "The View."

01:04.614 --> 01:07.149
West paid out nearly $20 million
in bribes all over New York

01:07.183 --> 01:09.217
to win the Hudson Nine
construction contract...

01:09.252 --> 01:11.720
three multi-use skyscrapers
going up in midtown.

01:11.754 --> 01:13.822
We have him on a dozen counts
of wire fraud and bribery.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.257
We have e-mails, we have documents,

01:15.291 --> 01:16.391
we have cooperating witnesses.

01:16.426 --> 01:18.660
We have a witness who will
testify he heard West offer...

01:18.695 --> 01:21.097
Okay. Okay. Got it. You have a case.

01:21.131 --> 01:22.476
What are you worried about, then?

01:22.510 --> 01:24.433
Kaws has an army of associates. So what?

01:24.467 --> 01:25.667
They're just people.

01:30.273 --> 01:31.873
Have they blinked?

01:31.908 --> 01:34.276
Third from the left...
she blinked, I think.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.278
Twice. I think.

01:36.312 --> 01:38.347
That guy has red eyes.

01:38.381 --> 01:41.450
Actual cyborg eyes, like the Terminator.

01:41.484 --> 01:43.785
Shh. It's just tactics, that's all.

01:43.820 --> 01:46.124
They are insanely good seat fillers.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.559
Mr. Kaws should be here any minute.

01:47.593 --> 01:48.927
We're fine. Thank you.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.197
Mm-hmm.

01:56.494 --> 01:57.893
I see.

02:00.339 --> 02:02.207
Mr. Kaws would like to apologize.

02:02.241 --> 02:04.776
He had a sudden family emergency
and had to leave.

02:04.810 --> 02:07.611
Can we call your office
once we have more information?

02:08.013 --> 02:09.280
- Now what?
- We call his bluff.

02:09.315 --> 02:10.817
You think he's lying about the emergency?

02:10.852 --> 02:12.131
Don't know. Don't care.
I'm calling the FBI

02:12.156 --> 02:13.251
and having them pick up Isaiah.

02:13.285 --> 02:14.452
We came here to <i>avoid</i> the spectacle

02:14.486 --> 02:15.787
of having a prominent New Yorker

02:15.821 --> 02:17.121
cuffed and dragged through the streets.

02:17.156 --> 02:19.123
I am not going to let Kaws play me.

02:19.158 --> 02:20.558
Mr. Knox.

02:20.593 --> 02:22.760
Turns out Mr. Kaws' wife
was only in a fender bender.

02:22.795 --> 02:24.429
She's being released from the hospital.

02:24.463 --> 02:25.997
Would you be fine meeting in an hour?

02:26.031 --> 02:27.599
You want us to wait here for an hour?

02:27.633 --> 02:30.068
Actually, would you mind meeting
Mr. Kaws at his apartment?

02:32.938 --> 02:35.055
I kind of want to see where he lives.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.108
Is there a seat filler needed?

02:37.142 --> 02:38.476
Otherwise, I'm going back to work.

02:38.510 --> 02:39.777
We got this, thanks.

02:39.812 --> 02:41.512
You were good.

02:45.784 --> 02:46.818
What's good?

02:46.852 --> 02:48.152
<i>Nothing</i> is good.

02:48.187 --> 02:50.355
I've been calling Anderson Frank
all morning. He's not picking up.

02:50.389 --> 02:53.191
It's generally not a super-literal
question. More like a greeting.

02:53.225 --> 02:55.260
Seriously, we need to make sure
he's coming to court tomorrow.

02:55.294 --> 02:56.694
He is our <i>key</i> witness...

02:56.729 --> 02:58.357
- Ask me.
- Huh?

02:58.392 --> 02:59.751
Ask me what's good.

02:59.785 --> 03:01.199
What's... good?

03:01.233 --> 03:03.268
I had a great breakfast.
Talked to my mom for a bit.

03:03.302 --> 03:04.636
Then I went to the boxing gym.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.272
20 on the heavy bag, did pads, sparred.

03:07.306 --> 03:08.640
Then I went to Anderson Frank's house

03:08.674 --> 03:10.541
and confirmed that
he'll be in court tomorrow.

03:10.576 --> 03:12.010
<i>That's</i> what's goo.

03:12.551 --> 03:14.379
I thought you said
it wasn't a literal question.

03:14.413 --> 03:15.647
You box?

03:15.681 --> 03:16.848
You made a face like I told you

03:16.882 --> 03:18.716
I won a national lumberjack
competition in high school.

03:18.751 --> 03:19.984
Yeah, I box.

03:20.019 --> 03:21.452
You just don't look like the type.

03:21.487 --> 03:22.620
What's the type?

03:22.655 --> 03:23.659
Tough.

03:23.694 --> 03:24.989
What do you know about looking tough?

03:25.024 --> 03:26.291
<i>- I'm</i> tough.
- You box?

03:26.325 --> 03:27.625
No, but I bet I could pick it up.

03:27.660 --> 03:28.993
- You're tiny.
- I'm fast.

03:29.028 --> 03:30.361
- You don't work out.
- You don't know that.

03:30.396 --> 03:31.396
You're always here.

03:32.431 --> 03:34.732
I have superhuman stamina.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.834
You've probably never
punched anyone in your life.

03:36.869 --> 03:39.671
Mm, Noah Sullivan,
Maureen Moreno, Duncan Pressman.

03:39.705 --> 03:41.239
Kindergarten, fifth-grade summer,

03:41.273 --> 03:42.373
senior year high school.

03:42.408 --> 03:43.574
Two hooks and a jab.

03:43.609 --> 03:44.666
Oh, let's fight, then.

03:44.701 --> 03:46.311
Not here. My gym, Canal and Church.

03:46.345 --> 03:48.195
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.213
Cool.

03:49.248 --> 03:51.082
I guess I'll show you what's good.

03:53.532 --> 03:54.698
Sandra!

03:59.024 --> 04:00.925
Nice weather. People are out.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.328
That includes the FBI and the NYPD,

04:03.362 --> 04:05.063
which means more arrests, more cases,

04:05.097 --> 04:07.117
and less of anything else
you do in your free time.

04:07.152 --> 04:08.223
Good morning.

04:08.258 --> 04:10.902
A dinner cancellation for you, Sandra.

04:10.936 --> 04:13.171
Continue never making plans.

04:13.205 --> 04:15.440
Jay, you won't be
riding your bike anytime soon.

04:15.474 --> 04:18.509
Actually, I'm gonna give this
to someone more senior.

04:18.543 --> 04:19.911
Well, what is it?

04:19.945 --> 04:21.012
A drug case.

04:21.046 --> 04:23.348
I had <i>16</i> drug cases last year... at once.

04:23.382 --> 04:25.849
This isn't a normal drug case.

04:25.884 --> 04:27.285
I'm not a normal public defender.

04:29.252 --> 04:31.923
This client is a federal inmate.

04:31.957 --> 04:33.419
I meet my clients in jail all the time.

04:33.453 --> 04:36.060
<i>Federal</i> prison. Otisville, not the MCC.

04:36.095 --> 04:38.062
Federal prison is different.

04:38.097 --> 04:40.898
I'm a city kid, Jill. I can handle this.

04:47.511 --> 04:49.879
How do I get to Otisville?

04:55.447 --> 04:56.647
Mr. Knox.

04:58.684 --> 05:00.952
- Ms. Littlejohn.
- No.

05:00.986 --> 05:02.086
Ah, respect.

05:02.452 --> 05:06.124
But it's Leonard, Kate, and Phil
from this point forward.

05:06.158 --> 05:07.291
And thank you for coming to me.

05:07.326 --> 05:10.461
I know it's highly irregular,
but couldn't be avoided.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.331
Y'all like pie?

05:14.076 --> 05:15.881
Mmm. My wife, Cheryl...

05:15.916 --> 05:17.765
the smell of sweet potato pie
really brightens her up.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.803
Is she okay?

05:18.837 --> 05:20.671
No concussion. Back's a little stiff.

05:20.706 --> 05:21.839
She was lucky.

05:21.874 --> 05:22.907
And she's got a good lawyer.

05:22.941 --> 05:23.808
Oh.

05:23.842 --> 05:24.809
- Sir...
- Phil.

05:24.843 --> 05:26.444
- We should talk.
- Of course.

05:26.478 --> 05:28.413
I will personally escort him to you,

05:28.447 --> 05:30.348
but we enter through
the back of the building.

05:30.382 --> 05:31.315
No agents, no press.

05:31.350 --> 05:33.818
We'd prefer if a few plain-clothed agents

05:33.852 --> 05:35.186
escort Isaiah from his home.

05:35.220 --> 05:36.788
The paparazzi camp out in his building

05:36.822 --> 05:39.490
because of all the high-profile
people that live there.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.360
There will be an overanalyzed photograph,

05:42.394 --> 05:43.528
and we can't afford that.

05:43.562 --> 05:44.977
Fine.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.247
No agents. And no leaks.
There'll be no press.

05:48.734 --> 05:51.202
It's nice to work with
reasonable prosecutors.

05:51.236 --> 05:52.703
So, Monday, noon.

05:52.738 --> 05:54.005
Tuesday would be better.

05:54.039 --> 05:56.474
His daughter Goldie... she just turned 5.

05:56.508 --> 05:58.276
Unbelievably cute.

05:58.310 --> 06:00.445
She has her first ballet recital
Monday night.

06:00.479 --> 06:03.014
We conceded everything else.
We're not conceding on the day.

06:03.048 --> 06:04.549
Isaiah will surrender his passport.

06:04.583 --> 06:05.683
He wants to face these charges.

06:05.717 --> 06:06.918
Just not until Tuesday.

06:06.952 --> 06:09.020
You're trying to make me care
about things I don't care about.

06:09.054 --> 06:10.032
He can't miss that recital.

06:10.066 --> 06:12.123
And I need him in on <i>Monday.</i>

06:16.516 --> 06:18.496
Kate, why don't we have some pie?

06:18.530 --> 06:21.532
See if we can't... change Leonard's mind.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.535
You ate his pie, and now his client

06:24.570 --> 06:25.903
gets to come in the back door?

06:25.938 --> 06:27.505
On Tuesday?

06:27.539 --> 06:29.841
When I and the FBI
explicitly told you Monday?

06:29.875 --> 06:31.476
West already surrendered his passport.

06:31.510 --> 06:33.177
He's got two G5s.

06:33.212 --> 06:35.580
We will have him in custody
on Tuesday. That's what matters.

06:35.614 --> 06:37.815
You know what matters? Perception.

06:37.850 --> 06:39.584
And now the perception is,

06:39.618 --> 06:42.153
if you are a billionaire
with a fancy attorney,

06:42.187 --> 06:44.822
the U.S. government will
polish your shoes for you.

06:44.857 --> 06:46.524
What was wrong with his wife <i>this</i> time?

06:46.558 --> 06:48.226
Flu? Minor car accident?

06:50.529 --> 06:52.063
A fender bender.

06:52.097 --> 06:55.500
I mean, hey, you're not alone.

06:55.534 --> 06:57.535
The city is littered with prosecutors

06:57.569 --> 06:59.537
who have been felled
by the smell of Kaws' pie.

06:59.571 --> 07:00.571
Sir, I...

07:00.606 --> 07:02.540
You ate his pie!

07:03.775 --> 07:10.923
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:15.173 --> 07:16.907
Your Honor, the defendant, Isaiah West,

07:16.941 --> 07:18.809
is charged with four counts of wire fraud

07:18.843 --> 07:21.111
and seven counts
of bribery of a public official.

07:21.145 --> 07:22.402
As set forth in the indictment,

07:22.436 --> 07:24.042
Mr. West engaged in a sophisticated...

07:24.076 --> 07:26.229
He has the indictment right there
in front of him, Mr. Knox.

07:26.263 --> 07:28.018
I think we can move this along.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.814
Your Honor, always a pleasure
to be in your court.

07:31.814 --> 07:33.248
We're asking that Mr. West

07:33.282 --> 07:34.316
be released on his own recognizance.

07:34.350 --> 07:36.351
- He's a flight risk.
- He surrendered his passport.

07:36.386 --> 07:38.019
He has <i>two</i> private planes.

07:38.054 --> 07:39.521
And where's he gonna land them? The moon?

07:39.555 --> 07:41.446
I believe they might have
that capacity, Your Honor.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.619
This is a nonviolent offense.

07:42.653 --> 07:44.192
Which is only one factor to consider.

07:44.227 --> 07:45.861
He also poses no threat to the community,

07:45.895 --> 07:47.286
which is another factor.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.964
Should we go through all of them?

07:48.998 --> 07:51.288
Okay. Great. You two done?

07:52.635 --> 07:54.436
Bail is set at $1 million.

07:54.470 --> 07:56.371
The government also requests
home detention.

07:56.406 --> 07:57.539
Uh, Your Honor, if I may,

07:57.573 --> 07:59.941
Mr. West is scheduled to appear

07:59.976 --> 08:03.046
at the I Have A Dream Foundation
in Washington, D.C., this week,

08:03.080 --> 08:05.914
where he's being honored as one
of their annual Dream Holders.

08:05.948 --> 08:07.549
I contacted the I Have A Dream Foundation

08:07.583 --> 08:08.784
in advance of this hearing.

08:08.818 --> 08:10.652
As Mr. West's honor was bestowed

08:10.686 --> 08:13.488
primarily because of his
generous financial donation,

08:13.523 --> 08:15.791
which the Foundation
has now decided to return,

08:15.825 --> 08:18.393
pending clarification
of Mr. West's pecuniary ethics,

08:18.428 --> 08:21.329
he is no longer being honored
as one of their Dream Holders.

08:21.364 --> 08:22.443
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Kaws.

08:22.477 --> 08:24.566
I just thought we could move this along.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.865
I'll agree to home detention.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.637
We're in recess.

08:28.671 --> 08:30.772
- Nice work.
- I know.

08:30.807 --> 08:32.140
You ready to talk deal?

08:32.174 --> 08:33.320
Depends.

08:33.663 --> 08:35.010
You coming to <i>me?</i>

08:36.359 --> 08:38.613
Probation? $25 million fine?

08:38.648 --> 08:41.482
What's $25 million
to someone worth $2.5 <i>billion?</i>

08:41.517 --> 08:43.684
Well, I believe it's still $25 million.

08:43.719 --> 08:45.754
With no jail time. The
government needs a deterrent.

08:45.788 --> 08:47.322
Well, who are you trying to deter?

08:47.356 --> 08:49.357
All the developers
that do this all the time?

08:49.804 --> 08:51.460
Here's an idea for a deterrent...

08:51.494 --> 08:52.494
prosecute <i>them.</i>

08:52.528 --> 08:53.462
I will.

08:53.496 --> 08:55.497
But your client could go to jail
for 20 years.

08:55.531 --> 08:57.532
Because of excessive
and redundant charging,

08:57.567 --> 08:58.696
which might appear

08:58.730 --> 09:00.869
as if the government
is out to get Isaiah.

09:00.903 --> 09:02.473
You know, if I didn't like you,

09:02.507 --> 09:05.674
I might... start saying as much
in the press.

09:07.009 --> 09:08.210
For the whole world to hear.

09:08.244 --> 09:10.846
Every... potential... juror.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.516
You know, Isaiah is beloved in this city.

09:14.550 --> 09:17.018
He was born and raised in Brownsville.

09:19.555 --> 09:22.724
I can accept five years, $5 million fine,

09:22.758 --> 09:24.559
with 5 years supervised release.

09:24.594 --> 09:26.361
Five years supervised release?

09:26.395 --> 09:28.029
Which means that he couldn't
work in real estate

09:28.064 --> 09:29.300
for five years?

09:29.335 --> 09:30.999
You want to effectively
put him out of business.

09:31.033 --> 09:32.200
I want my deterrent.

09:32.235 --> 09:33.702
Or would your client prefer to miss

09:33.736 --> 09:35.670
<i>every</i> milestone in his daughter's life?

09:36.706 --> 09:38.173
I'll take it back to Isaiah.

09:41.744 --> 09:43.211
Acknowledge this moment with me, Leonard.

09:43.246 --> 09:44.713
You're a prosecutor

09:44.747 --> 09:46.248
in the Southern District of New York.

09:46.282 --> 09:48.650
I am a partner at one of the largest

09:48.684 --> 09:50.919
and most prestigious law firms
in the country.

09:50.953 --> 09:54.756
Two black men negotiating

09:54.790 --> 09:58.026
above the greatest city in the world.

09:58.060 --> 10:01.663
Moments like these were unfathomable

10:01.697 --> 10:03.565
back when I decided to go to law school.

10:03.599 --> 10:06.001
I always like to acknowledge them.

10:06.035 --> 10:09.371
You are extremely talented.

10:12.642 --> 10:15.210
This is an honor, sir.

10:15.244 --> 10:17.412
You've been something
of a role model to me.

10:18.714 --> 10:20.682
You'll hear from me.

10:25.521 --> 10:27.956
Do you know what
you're being charged with?

10:27.990 --> 10:30.125
They're saying bagman plus ITD.

10:30.159 --> 10:31.192
That's right.

10:31.227 --> 10:33.428
Is that right? I have no idea
what you just said.

10:33.462 --> 10:35.063
Possession with intent to distribute.

10:35.097 --> 10:36.431
That is right.

10:36.465 --> 10:38.600
The allegation is you were in the yard

10:38.634 --> 10:41.970
when a drone dropped
a tennis ball filled with meth.

10:42.004 --> 10:44.806
There's a video of me grabbing the ball.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.642
The wack-ass guard
found the dope in my cell.

10:47.677 --> 10:48.677
I'm cooked.

10:48.711 --> 10:50.979
I just wanted to send
some money back to mom.

10:51.013 --> 10:53.261
I'm the only one she's got.

10:53.749 --> 10:55.283
I was supposed to be out in two months

10:55.318 --> 10:56.718
off my original gun charge.

10:56.752 --> 10:58.192
Now it'll be years.

10:58.226 --> 11:00.288
I know you're not feeling lucky now,

11:00.323 --> 11:04.426
but your luck changed
when Jay Simmons took your case.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.061
Who the hell is Jay Simmons?

11:06.095 --> 11:07.829
<i>I</i> am Jay Simmons.

11:07.863 --> 11:09.264
I took your case.

11:09.298 --> 11:10.665
Listen to me.

11:10.700 --> 11:13.668
This is a single incident
with a tiny quantity.

11:13.703 --> 11:15.637
You've been way overcharged here.

11:15.671 --> 11:17.138
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

11:17.173 --> 11:18.740
I know the prosecutor, too.

11:18.774 --> 11:20.141
We can work together.

11:20.176 --> 11:22.744
Fight fans around the world!

11:22.778 --> 11:25.146
Boy, have we got
something special for you!

11:25.181 --> 11:28.083
A battle royale!

11:28.117 --> 11:32.654
Welcome... to... the...
Affair in the Square!

11:32.688 --> 11:34.122
- Stop.
- I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

11:34.156 --> 11:35.590
The mood is fine.
I'm charging distribution.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.398
If he pleads guilty, he stays at
Otisville an additional four years.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.494
Four years?

11:39.528 --> 11:40.795
We're talking about a quantity so small,

11:40.830 --> 11:42.530
it fit inside a tennis ball.

11:42.565 --> 11:44.666
You... You can't name
three balls smaller than that.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.701
That... sounds stupid.
Why would I do that?

11:46.736 --> 11:48.870
I love the way we communicate. Celia...

11:48.904 --> 11:50.672
I'm still charging your client
with distribution,

11:50.706 --> 11:52.774
unless Mr. Brooks cooperates,

11:52.808 --> 11:54.709
flips on someone else in that prison.

11:54.744 --> 11:55.958
Distribution.

11:55.992 --> 11:57.879
How was the Affair in the Square?

11:57.913 --> 12:00.982
Eh, a bit of a letdown,
if I'm being honest.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.685
Should have been there.
No backing down, no pie eating.

12:03.719 --> 12:05.531
I earned his genuine respect.

12:05.565 --> 12:06.699
I'm just waiting for an answer.

12:06.733 --> 12:08.211
I think we have it.

12:08.758 --> 12:10.558
<i>The excessive and redundant
charging in this matter</i>

12:10.593 --> 12:12.894
<i>clearly demonstrates
that, for some reason...</i>

12:12.928 --> 12:14.663
<i>for some reason...</i>

12:14.697 --> 12:18.400
<i>the U.S. government is out
to humiliate Isaiah West...</i>

12:18.434 --> 12:21.202
<i>take him down, show him his place.</i>

12:21.237 --> 12:25.407
<i>Now, you might ask yourself,
why might that be?</i>

12:25.441 --> 12:27.542
<i>I will not allow the governmet</i>

12:27.576 --> 12:29.744
<i>to rob this black man of his livelihood.</i>

12:29.779 --> 12:31.379
<i>He will not be used as a scapegoat,</i>

12:31.414 --> 12:34.349
<i>as men who look like him
have been for centuries.</i>

12:34.383 --> 12:36.051
<i>I have two words for the government</i>

12:36.085 --> 12:37.852
<i>and my friend Leonard Knox...</i>

12:37.887 --> 12:39.587
<i>no deal.</i>

12:44.186 --> 12:46.272
- What is this?
- Draft remarks for my press conference.

12:46.297 --> 12:47.909
- What press conference?
- For the West case.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.135
- That's not happening.
- I have to respond.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.765
No, you do not. You <i>will</i> not.

12:51.765 --> 12:52.865
If Kaws gets out in front of this...

12:52.890 --> 12:53.856
He's out in front of this.

12:53.881 --> 12:55.014
He's out in front of <i>you.</i>

12:55.039 --> 12:57.207
He framed the narrative.
He owns it in the public now.

12:57.271 --> 12:59.606
And you going on TV will
only exacerbate the situation

12:59.640 --> 13:01.407
and make you and this office look petty.

13:01.442 --> 13:02.408
No!

13:05.879 --> 13:07.947
What do they say? "Fight a boxer
and box a fighter"?

13:07.982 --> 13:10.016
Kaws is trying to make this
a street fight.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.918
Build the case, win on points.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.060
Ooh! That all you got?

13:21.095 --> 13:22.962
I nearly took your hands off, dude.

13:22.997 --> 13:24.297
Decent, but if you want more power,

13:24.331 --> 13:25.732
you got to open up your stance.

13:25.766 --> 13:26.766
- You're a righty?
- Yeah.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.767
All right.

13:27.801 --> 13:28.935
Left foot forward.

13:28.969 --> 13:30.903
Feet shoulder-width apart.

13:30.938 --> 13:32.741
Drive through the punch.

13:33.182 --> 13:35.708
Okay. Now throw that Duncan Pressman hook

13:35.743 --> 13:37.410
and really step into it.

13:38.812 --> 13:40.813
- Wow! That's...
- Better.

13:40.848 --> 13:42.448
But if we were sparring,
I could easily counter.

13:42.483 --> 13:44.617
- Yeah, you wish.
- Right down the middle.

13:45.819 --> 13:46.786
Hmm.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.186
You're throwing a solid punch,

13:48.220 --> 13:49.822
but your hands drop
when you bring your glove back.

13:49.857 --> 13:51.958
All right, you're punching out like this.

13:51.992 --> 13:54.627
Your left hand has to stay
at the side of your face

13:54.662 --> 13:56.462
because you're most vulnerable
when you open up.

13:56.497 --> 13:57.703
And when your glove comes back,

13:57.737 --> 13:59.332
it has to come right back to your chin.

14:01.621 --> 14:02.588
Here?

14:02.648 --> 14:04.337
Ehh...

14:04.371 --> 14:05.738
Right there.

14:11.220 --> 14:12.245
All right, put those pads back on

14:12.279 --> 14:14.013
so I can hit you some more.

14:16.984 --> 14:18.284
One, two, three.

14:19.853 --> 14:21.754
Herbert, I really am sorry,

14:21.789 --> 14:24.123
but I couldn't get the
prosecutor to agree to a deal.

14:24.639 --> 14:25.958
It's fine.

14:25.993 --> 14:27.794
Now, if you want to cooperate...

14:27.828 --> 14:29.060
I want to go to trial.

14:29.863 --> 14:31.297
Okay.

14:31.332 --> 14:33.700
That is absolutely your right,

14:33.734 --> 14:34.879
but I have to advise you,

14:34.913 --> 14:36.769
there will be
some real challenges, given...

14:36.804 --> 14:38.671
I mean, how can they tell what I pick up

14:38.706 --> 14:39.872
in a grainy video?

14:39.907 --> 14:41.107
It's not actually that grainy.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.342
Maybe I picked up a rock.

14:42.376 --> 14:45.712
Maybe. Or maybe it was yellow
and bounced like a tennis ball.

14:45.746 --> 14:48.047
And these drugs are in <i>my</i> cell?

14:48.082 --> 14:49.220
Says who?

14:49.254 --> 14:50.950
The prison guard. He is who says that.

14:50.984 --> 14:53.219
This court doesn't even have
jurisdiction over me anyways.

14:53.253 --> 14:56.022
I really don't think we have
a jurisdictional argument.

14:56.056 --> 14:57.690
Under the UCC, we do.

14:57.725 --> 14:59.192
The Uniform Commercial Code?

14:59.226 --> 15:00.293
Maybe the FCC?

15:00.327 --> 15:01.794
Or the UFC.

15:01.829 --> 15:03.229
- That could be it.
- That's not it.

15:03.263 --> 15:04.630
Why... Why are you...

15:04.665 --> 15:06.032
I just know that my lawyer thinks

15:06.066 --> 15:07.567
that I'll get acquitted
if we go to trial.

15:07.601 --> 15:08.868
Your lawyer?

15:09.559 --> 15:10.970
<i>I</i> am your lawyer.

15:11.004 --> 15:12.872
Yeah. Of course.

15:12.906 --> 15:14.974
But I picked up <i>inside</i> counsel, to.

15:15.008 --> 15:16.334
Inside where?

15:16.368 --> 15:18.010
Here. This prison.

15:18.045 --> 15:19.111
I got lucky.

15:19.146 --> 15:21.214
Randy Stanton agreed to take my case.

15:21.248 --> 15:22.749
Who the hell is...

15:22.783 --> 15:24.016
Randy Stanton. Nice to meet you.

15:24.051 --> 15:26.342
- I'd shake, but, uh...
- I understand.

15:27.287 --> 15:29.088
You're eyeing my sneakers.

15:29.123 --> 15:31.257
Air Force 1s... classics.

15:31.291 --> 15:33.993
I have no idea what they are,
but they are blindingly white.

15:34.027 --> 15:35.895
Like, <i>so</i> white. Like, how do you
keep sneakers that white?

15:35.929 --> 15:36.929
You're from New York?

15:36.964 --> 15:39.332
I had some questions about <i>my</i> client,

15:39.366 --> 15:40.767
whom I hear you've been advising.

15:40.801 --> 15:42.186
Herbert's a sweet kid.

15:42.220 --> 15:44.003
Just needed some help
with his trial strategy.

15:44.037 --> 15:45.338
You see, that's the thing.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.575
There <i>isn't any trial strategy</i>

15:47.609 --> 15:49.609
because if we go to trial, we will lose.

15:49.643 --> 15:51.388
Certainly with <i>that</i> attitude.

15:51.422 --> 15:53.579
Listen, I can coach you
through the precedents

15:53.614 --> 15:55.081
we'll be citing on our client's behalf.

15:55.115 --> 15:56.192
<i>My</i> client...

15:56.234 --> 15:57.710
You don't have to be threatened by me.

15:57.744 --> 15:58.785
Threatened?

15:58.819 --> 16:00.453
We're just two lawyers strategizing.

16:00.487 --> 16:02.889
- Oh, you're a lawyer!
- Technically?

16:02.923 --> 16:04.572
You're either a lawyer
or you're <i>not</i> a lawyer.

16:05.392 --> 16:06.658
I practice law.

16:06.692 --> 16:09.695
I educated myself
in the prison law library.

16:09.730 --> 16:12.398
25 years of studying, as opposed to 3.

16:12.433 --> 16:14.066
Not quite the same
as attending law school

16:14.101 --> 16:16.202
taught by accredited legal professionals.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.870
- You're right.
- Mm.

16:17.905 --> 16:19.605
I'm also not buried
in so many student loans

16:19.640 --> 16:21.040
that I have to live with my parents.

16:21.074 --> 16:23.075
I don't live with my parents.

16:23.110 --> 16:24.407
Anymore.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.078
For, like, weeks.

16:26.113 --> 16:27.709
<i>A</i> week.

16:27.744 --> 16:29.415
Feels like much, much longer.

16:29.450 --> 16:31.117
How did you know I lived with my parents?

16:31.151 --> 16:33.453
I was just highlighting
a particular type of experience.

16:33.487 --> 16:35.822
Listen, the strategies
you filled Herbert's head with

16:35.856 --> 16:36.933
will not work.

16:36.968 --> 16:38.624
Trust me. I know this prosecutor.

16:38.659 --> 16:40.159
And Herbert has to flip on someone,

16:40.194 --> 16:42.728
or he will be here for <i>years</i>

16:42.763 --> 16:44.163
instead of a few more months.

16:44.198 --> 16:45.998
The world out there is very different.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.099
You want me to...

16:47.134 --> 16:48.301
You have to talk to Herbert.

16:48.741 --> 16:52.438
Giving the government something
is his only way out of this.

16:54.441 --> 16:55.641
I'll talk to him.

16:57.678 --> 16:59.512
If I were Kaws, and also because

16:59.546 --> 17:01.080
I'm the only one here
who worked at a big firm...

17:01.114 --> 17:03.182
- Mid-sized firm.
- <i>Bigger</i> firm.

17:03.217 --> 17:05.451
...I would want to separate Isaiah
from the rest of the company,

17:05.486 --> 17:07.453
say Isaiah had no clue what was
happening underneath him.

17:07.488 --> 17:09.755
We have multiple credible witnesses
who are going to testify

17:09.790 --> 17:11.022
that Isaiah was overseeing
this entire effort.

17:11.058 --> 17:14.126
The assemblyman's aide personally
saw Isaiah make an ask.

17:14.161 --> 17:15.694
So why isn't Kaws
having Isaiah take a deal?

17:15.729 --> 17:18.130
He can't... guys like this
promise their celebrity clients

17:18.165 --> 17:19.464
they can get them off, no problem.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.133
There's no benefit to Kaws settling.

17:21.167 --> 17:22.502
If he wins, he's a magician.

17:22.536 --> 17:24.637
If he loses, the case was unwinnable.

17:24.671 --> 17:26.305
Mr. Knox?

17:26.339 --> 17:27.607
Just put it on the desk.

17:29.209 --> 17:30.710
Whoa, whoa! What's all this?

17:30.744 --> 17:32.512
Is it cool if I just leave the
other cart outside your door?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.120
Sure.

17:35.549 --> 17:37.950
They're motions from the defense...

17:37.975 --> 17:39.041
dozens and dozens of motions.

17:39.066 --> 17:40.132
A Motion to Suppress.

17:40.157 --> 17:41.691
A Motion to Change Venue.

17:41.716 --> 17:42.783
A Motion to Compel.

17:42.808 --> 17:44.576
A Motion in Limine to exclude.

17:44.601 --> 17:46.068
A Motion in Limine to admit.

17:46.093 --> 17:48.161
I'm gonna have to argue
every single one of these,

17:48.186 --> 17:50.153
even though most of them are baseless.

17:50.178 --> 17:52.045
At least now we know
what Kaws' strategy is...

17:52.638 --> 17:54.133
to wear us out.

17:56.000 --> 18:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:06.280 --> 18:07.372
Tell me what we got.

18:07.407 --> 18:09.515
Your Honor, the defense's
Motion to Change Venue

18:09.550 --> 18:11.017
is entirely baseless.

18:11.051 --> 18:13.152
We obviously disagree, Your Honor,

18:13.186 --> 18:15.831
but in light of new discovery
provided by the prosecution,

18:15.865 --> 18:18.090
we'd like a day's recess
to better prepare our argument

18:18.125 --> 18:19.358
and revise the motion.

18:19.393 --> 18:20.826
Your Honor, the defense's motion

18:20.861 --> 18:23.195
is based on the type of paper used

18:23.230 --> 18:24.368
to copy the defendant's bank statements

18:24.402 --> 18:25.831
that we've entered into evidence.

18:25.866 --> 18:27.033
It's junk.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.200
The defense has conferred with

18:28.235 --> 18:31.070
and is prepared to call
<i>several</i> paper experts

18:31.104 --> 18:34.607
who can testify to the high
probability of inaccuracies

18:34.641 --> 18:37.176
when facsimiles are created on paper

18:37.210 --> 18:40.246
as low-caliber as the kind
the government utilizes.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.280
Motion denied.

18:41.315 --> 18:43.416
Our witness's private posts

18:43.450 --> 18:47.219
in his fantasy football league
are irrelevant.

18:47.254 --> 18:49.789
Your Honor, first and foremost,
fantasy football

18:49.823 --> 18:51.524
in the way this league
was set up is illegal.

18:51.558 --> 18:53.259
The witness already broke the law.

18:53.293 --> 18:56.095
And his posts show a pattern of lying

18:56.129 --> 18:58.431
and racially insensitive comments.

18:58.465 --> 18:59.675
Motion granted.

19:04.304 --> 19:06.472
Here's the bread I owe you.

19:14.948 --> 19:16.082
Motion denied.

19:16.116 --> 19:17.316
Denied. Denied.

19:17.351 --> 19:18.317
Denied.

19:18.352 --> 19:19.479
Reconvene on Monday morning

19:19.514 --> 19:21.253
for the commencement of the trial.

19:23.757 --> 19:25.558
You look beat. Get some sleep.

19:36.203 --> 19:38.077
How are things at Otisville?

19:38.083 --> 19:39.583
Let me tell you what it's like...

19:39.617 --> 19:41.386
to ride a bike through the city, Jill.

19:41.420 --> 19:43.220
It's never an entirely smooth ride...

19:43.254 --> 19:46.878
You can have the bike metaphor
or the helmet.

19:46.903 --> 19:47.989
Not both.

19:48.023 --> 19:49.405
Not either.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.066
Hit a little snag, but going well.

19:51.087 --> 19:53.688
Snag? I told you, prison clients
are a different beast.

19:53.723 --> 19:55.257
It isn't the client. It's his attorney.

19:55.291 --> 19:56.925
Aren't <i>you</i> his attorney?

19:56.959 --> 19:59.327
He hired inside counsel.

19:59.362 --> 20:01.396
A jailhouse lawyer
certainly complicates things.

20:01.430 --> 20:02.564
Do not worry.

20:02.598 --> 20:05.267
I've already used my wit
and expertise to win him over.

20:05.301 --> 20:07.669
Herbert is going to cooperate.

20:07.703 --> 20:08.937
So this is under control?

20:08.971 --> 20:11.206
Like I said, I am a kid from Queens.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.507
I can do anything.

20:12.541 --> 20:14.342
Under control.

20:14.377 --> 20:16.111
"Mission...

20:16.145 --> 20:17.612
Un-impossible."

20:17.950 --> 20:19.047
Okay.

20:20.116 --> 20:22.246
You have <i>got</i> to take that helmet off.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.395
Wait. What's this?

20:25.429 --> 20:27.355
Your case at Otisville.
A call came through.

20:27.390 --> 20:29.291
Herbert got tossed in the SHU.

20:29.325 --> 20:30.292
Solitary.

20:32.428 --> 20:34.629
"Mission <i>Impossible"?</i>

20:40.313 --> 20:41.369
What are you doing?

20:41.404 --> 20:42.445
Nothing.

20:42.479 --> 20:43.605
Is that my newspaper?

20:43.639 --> 20:45.440
What kind of question is that?

20:45.474 --> 20:47.475
You're in my office.
You're holding a newspaper.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.144
I'm pretty sure it's got my name on it.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.933
What?

20:50.958 --> 20:53.332
<i>The Sentinel</i> ran an artice
today about Kaws.

20:53.366 --> 20:54.449
So?

20:54.483 --> 20:56.084
- He talks about the case.
- Of course he does.

20:56.118 --> 20:57.531
He talks about <i>you.</i>

20:58.020 --> 20:59.313
- Let me see.
- You shouldn't.

20:59.348 --> 21:00.889
Do you think that's
the last paper on Earth?

21:00.923 --> 21:02.357
You need to focus on this trial.

21:03.426 --> 21:05.272
- Read it to me.
- What?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.614
You're not gonna give it to me,
so read it to me.

21:06.648 --> 21:07.687
It's a distraction.

21:07.721 --> 21:09.898
Read it... to me.

21:14.103 --> 21:17.172
Uh, Kaws talks a lot about
himself and his upbringing.

21:17.206 --> 21:18.540
Don't care.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.943
"Isaiah West is a favorite son
of New York City."

21:21.977 --> 21:23.511
What does he say about <i>me?</i>

21:30.286 --> 21:32.454
"Contrast Mr. West

21:32.488 --> 21:34.356
with the prosecutor, Leonard Knox,

21:34.390 --> 21:36.358
who has been handed
everything in his life.

21:36.392 --> 21:38.093
Son of a United States Senator...

21:38.127 --> 21:40.362
privileged enough
and blind enough to history

21:40.396 --> 21:42.400
to be a black Republican."

21:47.303 --> 21:49.504
"As Mr. Kaws gets visibly irritated,

21:49.538 --> 21:51.373
I understand the historical significance

21:51.407 --> 21:54.509
of words like 'token' and 'Uncle Tom.'

21:54.543 --> 21:56.845
As a black man
born in the Jim Crow South,

21:56.879 --> 21:58.313
I don't use these words lightly.

21:58.347 --> 21:59.381
I know their power.

21:59.415 --> 22:00.448
But in this case,

22:00.483 --> 22:02.517
I don't see any other way
to describe Mr. Knox.

22:02.551 --> 22:04.285
I wonder if he even realizes

22:04.320 --> 22:07.455
the true reason
he was chosen for this case.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.224
Pure optics."

22:10.393 --> 22:11.793
Optics?

22:11.827 --> 22:13.495
Is that why I was chosen for this?

22:14.697 --> 22:15.897
I can't answer your question.

22:15.931 --> 22:17.399
You put me on this case!

22:17.433 --> 22:20.568
No, I didn't. I put Littlejohn
on it, and I was overruled.

22:20.603 --> 22:21.736
This came from above.

22:25.327 --> 22:27.542
I need to talk to you
about the Isaiah West case.

22:27.576 --> 22:31.413
Something's bothering you enough
to barge into my office,

22:31.699 --> 22:33.133
so let's talk about it.

22:38.788 --> 22:40.384
Why was I chosen for this case?

22:42.625 --> 22:43.833
You think you want the answer,

22:43.868 --> 22:45.760
but what you really want
is for me to lie to you.

22:45.795 --> 22:46.828
That's not what I want.

22:46.862 --> 22:47.829
Yes, it is.

22:47.863 --> 22:50.064
You want me to tell you
that you were chosen

22:50.099 --> 22:51.699
solely because of your immense talent

22:51.734 --> 22:53.401
and tremendous work ethic.

22:53.436 --> 22:55.737
I can't do that, because I chose you

22:55.771 --> 22:57.939
because you're a black man. Mr. Knox.

22:58.652 --> 23:00.275
Of course you are talented.

23:00.309 --> 23:02.178
You wouldn't be
in this building otherwise.

23:02.213 --> 23:05.246
But you were specifically chosen

23:05.281 --> 23:06.681
due to the color of your skin.

23:06.715 --> 23:09.451
I know how Phillip Kaws plays the game.

23:09.485 --> 23:12.620
I also know Isaiah West is
a beloved figure in this city.

23:12.655 --> 23:15.290
And I also believe that he broke the law,

23:15.324 --> 23:18.393
and I dislike when people
break the law and go unpunished.

23:18.756 --> 23:20.261
Why do you look surprised?

23:20.296 --> 23:21.796
I'm disappointed.

23:21.831 --> 23:23.531
Because we're post-racial?

23:23.566 --> 23:25.633
Because I value winning
over your feelings?

23:25.668 --> 23:29.671
I have earned <i>everything</i>
<i>I have ever gotten in my life.</i>

23:33.938 --> 23:35.944
I can tell that you believe that.

23:35.978 --> 23:38.150
But no. You haven't.

23:39.114 --> 23:40.415
No one has.

23:42.284 --> 23:43.985
I grew up in Battle Creek, Michigan.

23:44.019 --> 23:46.721
My mother worked at a cereal plant.

23:46.755 --> 23:48.623
My father worked everywhere and nowhere,

23:48.657 --> 23:50.058
if that makes any sense.

23:50.092 --> 23:52.794
Needless to say, my mother was thrilled

23:52.828 --> 23:56.097
when I was accepted to Stanford in 1983.

23:56.131 --> 23:58.333
I was terrified

23:58.367 --> 24:01.469
of how liberal
everyone said California was.

24:01.504 --> 24:05.640
Yet it took all of seven hours
for someone to suggest

24:05.674 --> 24:07.642
that I was only there

24:07.676 --> 24:09.878
because of some affirmative action quota.

24:11.013 --> 24:13.314
I called my mom that night,

24:13.349 --> 24:15.256
tried not to break down.

24:15.291 --> 24:17.986
I told her what was said to me.
Her response?

24:18.020 --> 24:19.187
"So what?"

24:21.390 --> 24:23.691
So what, Mr. Knox?

24:23.726 --> 24:24.726
What are you gonna do

24:24.760 --> 24:27.695
now that you know
you've been used as a pawn?

24:27.730 --> 24:29.631
And if you've been running around life

24:29.656 --> 24:31.323
thinking race doesn't matter,

24:31.367 --> 24:34.602
that nobody notices
that you're a black man,

24:34.637 --> 24:38.373
then I'm happy
to have done you this favor.

24:38.752 --> 24:40.608
They notice.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.610
Anything else?

24:43.679 --> 24:44.913
No.

24:53.563 --> 24:54.529
Leonard.

24:54.554 --> 24:55.856
I'm putting the assemblyman's
aide up first.

24:55.891 --> 24:57.024
He's our strongest witness.

24:57.058 --> 24:58.492
- We can follow with Ag...
- Leonard, how are you doing?

24:58.526 --> 24:59.672
I'm fine.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.861
We can follow with Agent O'Donnell.

25:00.896 --> 25:02.930
What did Delap say?

25:02.964 --> 25:04.698
- It's nothing.
- You're not fine.

25:04.733 --> 25:06.270
You don't know anything about me.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.801
Who does?

25:10.939 --> 25:12.039
Close the door.

25:24.786 --> 25:26.467
I went to boarding school.

25:27.096 --> 25:28.863
Woodberry Forrest.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.058
Sophomore year,
I went home for the holidays.

25:31.092 --> 25:32.973
My mom got me a BMW.

25:33.521 --> 25:35.489
Navy with tan interior.

25:36.598 --> 25:39.233
One night, I was leaving the movies,

25:39.267 --> 25:41.835
and a police officer
started following me.

25:43.571 --> 25:45.205
Felt like an hour.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.771
I took a right at a traffic
light into my neighborhood.

25:47.772 --> 25:49.139
He turned his sirens on.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.616
I pulled over.

25:51.276 --> 25:53.077
He walked up, hand on his gun,

25:53.111 --> 25:55.412
and asked whether the car was stolen.

25:55.447 --> 25:58.115
He told me to get out,
put my hands on the car.

25:59.350 --> 26:00.818
While he ran the plates, I stood there

26:00.852 --> 26:05.172
confused, terrified, embarrassed.

26:05.857 --> 26:08.133
He walked back and said,

26:08.727 --> 26:11.387
"Your mama's doing an excellent job."

26:11.863 --> 26:14.698
He apologized and let me go.

26:19.904 --> 26:22.106
I didn't tell my mom what happened.

26:23.208 --> 26:26.744
We have <i>never talked about race.</i>

26:26.778 --> 26:29.780
She thought talking about it
made a perceived handicap real,

26:29.814 --> 26:30.814
so...

26:31.448 --> 26:32.950
when I went back to school,
I thought I could talk

26:32.984 --> 26:35.285
to one of the three other
black kids in my class about it.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.998
When I tried, Andre Merriweather...

26:39.657 --> 26:42.192
told me nothing had <i>really</i> happened,

26:42.227 --> 26:44.061
because I wasn't really black.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.197
Said my mom was a sellout, and so was I.

26:47.232 --> 26:48.599
When I talked to my best friend,
Mark Spathe...

26:48.633 --> 26:50.092
a white kid... about it,

26:51.069 --> 26:53.470
he said, "Cool. You got away with it."

26:54.172 --> 26:56.273
He started talking about where
we should go on spring break.

26:56.307 --> 26:57.775
I am sick of this.

26:58.977 --> 27:00.602
Not belonging...

27:02.580 --> 27:04.047
anywhere.

27:06.611 --> 27:08.011
Just...

27:08.036 --> 27:10.571
Just for being exactly who I am.

27:14.826 --> 27:17.619
Then people call me arrogant
'cause I walk with my head high,

27:18.663 --> 27:19.830
say I blow right past them.

27:19.864 --> 27:21.799
They don't want me anyway.

27:28.666 --> 27:30.591
I am not quitting this case.

27:31.810 --> 27:33.610
I am gonna win this case.

27:36.096 --> 27:37.681
Mr. Blinken, you were an aide

27:37.715 --> 27:39.750
to Assemblyman Charles Thomas, correct?

27:39.784 --> 27:40.851
Yes, that's correct.

27:40.885 --> 27:42.753
In the course of your work
for Assemblyman Thomas,

27:42.787 --> 27:44.788
did you arrange a meeting
between the assemblyman

27:44.823 --> 27:47.257
- and the defendant, Mr. West?
- Yes.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.692
And can you tell the jury

27:48.726 --> 27:51.028
what transpired between Mr. West
and Assemblyman Thomas

27:51.062 --> 27:52.362
at this meeting?

27:52.397 --> 27:54.298
Mr. West offered Assemblyman Thomas

27:54.332 --> 27:56.667
the use of a penthouse apartment
in one of his buildings.

27:56.701 --> 27:58.368
He also offered contracting services

27:58.403 --> 28:00.337
for the assemblyman's current residence.

28:00.371 --> 28:01.673
How did Assemblyman Thomas vote

28:01.707 --> 28:03.874
on the Hudson Nine development
after that meeting?

28:03.908 --> 28:05.918
He changed his vote
to support Mr. West's bid.

28:06.644 --> 28:09.813
Did Assemblyman Thomas know Mr. West

28:09.848 --> 28:11.782
- prior to this meeting?
- He did not.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.820
- Did they socialize?
- Not to my knowledge.

28:13.854 --> 28:15.719
Did Assemblyman Thomas socialize

28:15.753 --> 28:17.821
with other New York developers
bidding on Hudson Nine?

28:17.856 --> 28:20.090
Yes, he did... frequently.

28:21.426 --> 28:22.526
<i>White</i> developers?

28:22.560 --> 28:23.493
Objection!

28:23.528 --> 28:25.529
Your Honor, I'm simply
trying to establish

28:25.563 --> 28:27.030
that Mr. West was at

28:27.065 --> 28:30.367
a serious institutional
disadvantage to his rivals

28:30.401 --> 28:32.836
in having access to decision makers,

28:32.871 --> 28:34.238
like the assemblyman.

28:34.272 --> 28:35.973
I'll withdraw my question.

28:36.007 --> 28:38.408
Agent O'Donnell,
you led the investigation

28:38.443 --> 28:40.811
into the defendant, Mr. West,
including the analysis

28:40.845 --> 28:43.203
- of Mr. West's financial records?
- Yes.

28:43.237 --> 28:45.048
Did Mr. West distribute cash

28:45.083 --> 28:47.551
or in-kind donations to organized labor

28:47.585 --> 28:49.219
involved in the Hudson Nine development?

28:49.254 --> 28:50.254
Yes.

28:50.288 --> 28:51.121
Have you investigated

28:51.155 --> 28:52.923
other New York real estate developers

28:52.957 --> 28:55.191
for allegedly bribing
union officers, Agent O'Donnell?

28:55.225 --> 28:56.193
Yes.

28:56.227 --> 28:57.450
- How many?
- Eight.

28:57.485 --> 28:59.763
In how many of those eight investigations

28:59.797 --> 29:02.332
was the target of the
investigation African-American?

29:02.367 --> 29:03.406
None.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.768
- All white?
- Objection.

29:04.802 --> 29:06.503
It goes to bias, Your Honor.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.772
Overruled. You may answer.

29:08.806 --> 29:10.841
Yes... all white.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.542
How many indictments were issued

29:12.577 --> 29:14.211
as a result of these investigations?

29:14.245 --> 29:15.423
None.

29:15.457 --> 29:16.480
So, to be clear,

29:16.514 --> 29:18.715
you investigated eight white developers

29:18.750 --> 29:21.251
for the same kind of conduct
alleged here,

29:21.286 --> 29:23.086
but in each of those instances,

29:23.121 --> 29:25.689
the U.S. Attorney's Office
declined to indict?

29:25.723 --> 29:26.890
That is correct.

29:26.925 --> 29:28.225
You were employed by Mr. West?

29:28.259 --> 29:30.193
Yes, I was... for three years.

29:30.228 --> 29:32.029
What was Operation Friendship?

29:32.063 --> 29:34.464
Operation Friendship
was Mr. West's campaign

29:34.499 --> 29:37.595
to influence decision makers
on the Hudson Nine project...

29:37.629 --> 29:40.070
unions, politicians, community leaders.

29:40.104 --> 29:42.105
Did Mr. West speak specifically about

29:42.140 --> 29:44.241
what he would use to influence
these decision makers

29:44.275 --> 29:45.622
as part of Operation Friendship?

29:45.656 --> 29:46.710
Yes.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.745
He spoke about in-kind gifts,

29:48.780 --> 29:50.526
as well as cash disbursements.

29:50.561 --> 29:52.649
You were fired by Mr. West, correct?

29:52.684 --> 29:53.951
We had a disagreement.

29:53.985 --> 29:54.952
Yes or no?

29:54.986 --> 29:56.219
Yes.

29:56.254 --> 29:58.322
Where do you work now, Mr. Ogoff?

29:58.356 --> 29:59.790
At Lakesea Development.

29:59.824 --> 30:01.291
A competitor of Mr. West's.

30:01.326 --> 30:03.293
- Yes.
- Isn't it true, Mr. Ogoff,

30:03.328 --> 30:04.962
that Lakesea Development has been cited

30:04.996 --> 30:07.397
by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development

30:07.432 --> 30:09.633
14 times for racial discrimination

30:09.667 --> 30:11.835
and other violations
of the Fair Housing Act?

30:11.869 --> 30:13.236
Objection!

30:15.273 --> 30:17.741
Why is Herbert in solitary?

30:17.775 --> 30:19.176
Threw his dinner at a guard.

30:19.210 --> 30:21.244
- Herbert?
- He had to get in the SHU.

30:21.279 --> 30:24.114
You told Herbert to
throw his food at the guards?

30:24.148 --> 30:27.317
No. I told him he had to get in
the SHU by any means necessary.

30:27.352 --> 30:28.852
Client discretion.

30:28.886 --> 30:30.420
Some guys steal, some guys shank.

30:30.455 --> 30:31.989
You just don't get it, do you?

30:32.023 --> 30:34.358
I'm trying. I really am trying.

30:34.942 --> 30:37.394
How many defendants have you had
in federal prison?

30:38.396 --> 30:40.831
I don't usually like to talk
about past cases.

30:40.865 --> 30:42.599
So none.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.201
I've had hundreds.

30:44.235 --> 30:45.402
You have any idea why

30:45.436 --> 30:47.938
the government overcharged
Herbert for a few grams of meth?

30:47.972 --> 30:51.308
Because they thought his
original sentence was too light.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.043
I know this stuff.

30:53.502 --> 30:54.878
They're trying to squeeze Herbert.

30:55.212 --> 30:57.381
The bosses in here know this, too.

30:57.415 --> 30:59.850
They've been circling Herbert,
knives out,

30:59.884 --> 31:01.843
since you came through the door.

31:02.653 --> 31:03.687
Okay.

31:03.721 --> 31:04.855
So...

31:05.264 --> 31:06.556
what do we do?

31:07.015 --> 31:08.892
All of a sudden, it's "we"?

31:09.226 --> 31:11.661
Like you said, bud,
life is different out there.

31:11.696 --> 31:16.066
I did what I could
to help my client in <i>here.</i>

31:16.100 --> 31:18.969
He's still gonna face
four more years in prison.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.570
But at least he'll be alive.

31:20.605 --> 31:21.796
What kind of life is that?

31:25.410 --> 31:28.879
I've been in here 25 years,
and I'm never leaving.

31:28.913 --> 31:30.747
Herbert will have to figure it out,

31:31.331 --> 31:32.983
just like <i>I</i> did.

32:02.246 --> 32:04.081
You're stealing my moves.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.983
I wish I would have known.
We could have coordinated.

32:09.821 --> 32:12.355
I did a dress rehearsal in the courtroom

32:12.390 --> 32:14.024
the night before my first big trial.

32:14.058 --> 32:16.835
State vs. Montgomery, 1986.

32:17.395 --> 32:19.171
You wrote about it in your book.

32:20.098 --> 32:21.219
It's great, isn't it?

32:21.253 --> 32:22.632
The sport of it.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.384
And this...

32:25.002 --> 32:26.536
this is the arena.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.350
But it can get ugly.

32:32.276 --> 32:34.211
Because everyone wants to win.

32:35.686 --> 32:38.521
I truly hope that we can
shake hands at the end of this.

32:40.518 --> 32:41.751
You don't respect me.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.154
You're a complete phony...

32:44.188 --> 32:47.157
empty, hollow, just like this case.

32:47.191 --> 32:49.059
You claim to be for the people,

32:49.093 --> 32:50.727
but you're not for anyone
other than yourself,

32:50.761 --> 32:52.229
because if you were...

32:53.993 --> 32:55.844
...you'd have Isaiah take a deal.

32:55.878 --> 32:57.834
My record is out there for anyone to see.

32:57.869 --> 32:59.436
That's the first true thing you've said.

32:59.470 --> 33:01.138
You've spent the last 20 years

33:01.172 --> 33:02.839
mostly representing corporations,

33:02.874 --> 33:04.274
making sure white CEOs don't go down

33:04.308 --> 33:06.109
for sexually assaulting their employees.

33:06.144 --> 33:08.011
Your last big case? Rampart Bank.

33:08.045 --> 33:09.946
They literally stole a billion dollars

33:09.981 --> 33:11.066
from everyday Americans

33:11.100 --> 33:13.150
in Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Idaho, and Wyoming.

33:13.184 --> 33:14.751
You made sure those people walked away

33:14.785 --> 33:16.155
with as little as possible.

33:16.189 --> 33:19.422
Swifton Foods knowingly shipped
their contaminated produce

33:19.457 --> 33:21.458
to supermarkets in the inner city

33:21.492 --> 33:23.693
because they thought they could
get away with it there.

33:23.728 --> 33:26.463
Black children died.

33:26.497 --> 33:27.764
Which side were you on?

33:27.798 --> 33:30.380
- One day, you will understand...
- Shut up, dude! I understand right now.

33:30.415 --> 33:32.602
I understand
you don't stand for <i>anything.</i>

33:32.637 --> 33:34.671
And since you already took it there,

33:34.705 --> 33:36.873
not standing for anything

33:36.908 --> 33:39.176
is the least black thing I can think of.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.144
And if I was really petty...

33:42.213 --> 33:43.813
...which I'm not, but...

33:43.848 --> 33:45.382
I'm gonna make an exception for you...

33:45.416 --> 33:46.950
I would also remind the world

33:46.984 --> 33:49.219
how you left your black wife
when she was sick with cancer

33:49.253 --> 33:50.787
for a 26-year-old blonde.

33:51.923 --> 33:53.598
You're not John Lewis, bro.

33:54.158 --> 33:55.058
You are lost.

33:55.092 --> 33:56.793
You are a loser.

33:56.827 --> 34:00.363
And your biggest mistake,
beyond your many moral failings,

34:01.189 --> 34:03.533
was underestimating me.

34:09.290 --> 34:10.699
Mr. Knox?

34:29.612 --> 34:31.379
Isaiah West is a role model.

34:31.981 --> 34:34.181
He's a man to be admired. I admire him.

34:34.216 --> 34:36.717
Some of you may have
known of him prior to this case.

34:36.752 --> 34:38.253
He may have spoken at your high school

34:38.277 --> 34:40.045
or at your college graduation.

34:40.089 --> 34:41.989
You may have seen him giving out toys

34:42.024 --> 34:43.925
to underprivileged kids on television.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.775
He is a self-made New Yorker.

34:46.395 --> 34:48.062
He is an overwhelming success.

34:48.097 --> 34:50.231
Isaiah West is all of those things,

34:50.266 --> 34:53.701
and also a man who broke the law.

34:53.735 --> 34:56.719
Make no mistake... that is the
only thing we are here to judge.

34:58.107 --> 35:01.409
The defense did not dispute the
fact that Mr. West broke the law.

35:01.443 --> 35:04.112
The defense did not dispute
any of our facts.

35:04.146 --> 35:06.414
Instead, they attempted
to cloud your brains

35:06.448 --> 35:10.551
with baseless conspiracy
theories to obscure the facts.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.920
Is Isaiah West
the first real estate developer

35:12.945 --> 35:14.579
to use bribes in order to land business?

35:14.604 --> 35:16.272
I don't believe so.

35:16.325 --> 35:19.927
Has he experienced prejudice
and retaliation

35:19.962 --> 35:22.397
from the established old guard
of New York City developers?

35:22.431 --> 35:24.132
I believe so.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.968
But that does not change
the fact he broke the law.

35:27.002 --> 35:29.470
There are times where
breaking the law is necessary,

35:29.505 --> 35:32.540
where it is an effective way
to bring about change.

35:32.574 --> 35:37.378
Rosa Parks, John Lewis,
Nelson Mandela, Bree Newsome.

35:37.413 --> 35:40.248
And there are points in history
where we <i>should</i> look at a crime

35:40.282 --> 35:42.250
and understand the larger social context

35:42.284 --> 35:46.454
and potentially have that affect
our determination of guilt.

35:46.488 --> 35:47.712
This...

35:48.957 --> 35:51.292
right here, this moment, this case...

35:51.841 --> 35:53.461
is not one of them.

35:53.495 --> 35:55.229
This is a financial crime

35:55.264 --> 35:59.767
in which an incredibly wealthy
man bribed officials

35:59.802 --> 36:02.570
in order to make himself
even more wealthy.

36:02.604 --> 36:05.606
And Mr. Kaws is banking on you
not seeing the distinction,

36:05.641 --> 36:07.642
but Isaiah West is not Rosa Parks.

36:07.676 --> 36:10.794
This is not a protest of a rigged system.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.313
It is a crime.

36:12.654 --> 36:15.323
Our role models are not perfect.

36:15.818 --> 36:17.819
It is a sad day when we realize this.

36:17.853 --> 36:19.454
They make mistakes,

36:19.488 --> 36:22.372
and they should not be
let off the hook when they do.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.495
I'm ready to go to trial.

36:27.529 --> 36:28.996
You wanted it, you're getting it,

36:29.031 --> 36:30.264
but I'm not laying down.

36:30.299 --> 36:31.999
Forget the Affair in the Square.

36:32.024 --> 36:34.592
This is Scotland versus King Edward I,

36:34.636 --> 36:36.371
and I'm gonna fight you to the death.

36:36.405 --> 36:38.106
You're gonna wish you settled this case,

36:38.140 --> 36:40.174
because I'm gonna watch
that scene from "Braveheart"

36:40.209 --> 36:44.078
every night until this trial is over.

36:45.681 --> 36:46.798
You haven't seen "Braveheart."

36:46.823 --> 36:48.090
I'm dismissing the case.

36:48.115 --> 36:49.193
You're dismissing the case?

36:49.218 --> 36:50.685
This case? T-This one?

36:50.719 --> 36:51.986
This is the case you're dismissing?

36:52.020 --> 36:54.288
The guard who said he found the
tennis ball in your client's cell?

36:54.323 --> 36:55.488
He says he was wrong.

36:55.511 --> 36:56.784
He wasn't in that cell after all

36:56.785 --> 36:59.509
like magic gone, just like my case.

37:02.975 --> 37:04.599
- Fore.
- What?

37:04.633 --> 37:07.668
Golf ball, Ping-Pong ball,
squash, and racquetball...

37:07.703 --> 37:09.537
four balls smaller than a tennis ball.

37:09.571 --> 37:10.920
I would have crushed you.

37:12.841 --> 37:14.776
You'll be out of here in 53 days.

37:18.136 --> 37:20.081
It's my Mom's birthday today.

37:20.115 --> 37:22.265
I couldn't get her anything.

37:22.951 --> 37:24.452
But this should make up for it.

37:25.521 --> 37:27.522
Do you mind if I have a minute
with my co-counsel?

37:29.977 --> 37:31.644
Thank you both.

37:37.566 --> 37:39.233
The guard changed his testimony.

37:39.268 --> 37:41.235
It <i>is</i> a surprise.

37:41.270 --> 37:42.403
Not really.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.705
These guys are busy.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.741
They got a lot of pressure
on them. They forget things.

37:46.775 --> 37:48.376
I've seen it before... many times.

37:48.410 --> 37:49.844
So, what are you gonna do now?

37:50.879 --> 37:52.246
You know how it is.

37:52.281 --> 37:53.514
You win a case, you lose a client.

37:53.549 --> 37:55.416
Got to get right back out here.

37:55.451 --> 37:57.452
Lot of business, though.

37:57.486 --> 37:59.420
And while I do have
a particular expertise

37:59.455 --> 38:02.190
in dental malpractice, I'm a generalist.

38:02.224 --> 38:04.959
Assaults, dog bites, uh...

38:04.993 --> 38:07.195
auto accidents, murder, estate planning.

38:07.229 --> 38:08.563
Auto accidents in here?

38:09.104 --> 38:10.932
Guards and their families, mostly.

38:11.564 --> 38:12.934
You represent guards?

38:13.233 --> 38:16.204
Everyone is entitled to a lawyer, Jay.

38:18.674 --> 38:20.208
I-I have to go.

38:20.740 --> 38:22.343
You're one of the good ones.

38:23.345 --> 38:26.113
I hope we get to work together
in the future.

38:27.149 --> 38:28.665
Take care of yourself, Randy.

38:29.451 --> 38:31.385
Got no other choice.

38:36.925 --> 38:38.059
You came back.

38:38.093 --> 38:39.217
Yeah.

38:39.251 --> 38:41.043
Yeah, I like it in here.

38:41.077 --> 38:42.497
I like that you're here.

38:42.531 --> 38:44.431
I like seeing you outside the office.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.034
Hmm.

38:48.470 --> 38:50.004
My life is my work.

38:50.038 --> 38:51.772
I go to sleep, I go to work.

38:51.807 --> 38:54.308
I'm not complaining.
It's the way it has to be.

38:54.343 --> 38:56.444
It's what I love to do.

38:56.478 --> 38:58.112
People's lives are in my hands,

38:58.146 --> 39:00.314
and nothing is more important than that.

39:00.349 --> 39:03.117
So I don't watch TV, I don't read books,

39:03.151 --> 39:05.286
I don't go to the farmers market,

39:05.320 --> 39:07.954
and I'm not in a bowling league...

39:08.457 --> 39:11.592
because I can't afford distractions...

39:11.627 --> 39:12.894
of any kind.

39:14.229 --> 39:17.365
But this cleared my mind the other day.

39:17.399 --> 39:19.133
I worked better.

39:19.167 --> 39:20.668
And I liked what you taught me.

39:20.702 --> 39:22.336
So...

39:22.371 --> 39:23.803
I'm here.

39:24.573 --> 39:27.808
I'm choosing boxing as a distraction.

39:29.411 --> 39:32.395
But that is the only distraction
I am choosing.

39:33.348 --> 39:34.448
Understand?

39:35.330 --> 39:36.816
Understood.

39:37.519 --> 39:38.653
We are boxing.

39:38.687 --> 39:39.820
Mm-hmm.

39:41.390 --> 39:43.024
So let's box.

39:47.285 --> 39:49.363
Have you reached a unanimous verdict?

39:49.398 --> 39:50.581
Yes, Your Honor.

39:50.615 --> 39:53.534
In the matter of
United States vs. Isaiah West,

39:53.569 --> 39:56.137
how do you find
the defendant, Isaiah West,

39:56.171 --> 39:57.838
on Count One, wire fraud?

39:59.344 --> 40:00.408
Guilty.

40:00.442 --> 40:01.842
With respect to Count Two,

40:01.877 --> 40:03.411
bribery of a public official,

40:03.445 --> 40:06.247
how do you find the defendant...
guilty or not guilty?

40:06.281 --> 40:07.481
Guilty.

40:07.516 --> 40:09.083
With respect to Count Three,

40:09.117 --> 40:11.018
conspiracy to commit wire fraud,

40:11.053 --> 40:14.322
how do you find the defendant...
guilty or not guilty?

40:14.356 --> 40:15.656
Guilty.

40:21.363 --> 40:22.496
Good job.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.108
Ride with me?

40:44.653 --> 40:47.555
You said something to me once. You said,

40:47.589 --> 40:49.890
"You don't celebrate
people going to jail."

40:52.561 --> 40:55.563
I don't think I fully
understood that until now.

40:59.329 --> 41:00.701
I can't go back up there.

41:00.736 --> 41:03.778
What are you doing?
Hand Pulled Noodle House?

41:07.776 --> 41:10.411
I have some more work... to do.

41:19.187 --> 41:20.354
Leonard.
