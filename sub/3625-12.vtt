21:46.348 --> 21:48.176
I'm not looking
for a distribution deal.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.265
Just a local arts grant
so I can pay my rent.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.399
Now if you'll excuse me..

21:55.183 --> 21:57.403
...you're in my shot.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.362
[instrumental music]

22:08.152 --> 22:10.024
What's that?
Your stripper money?

22:10.111 --> 22:12.200
Ten thousand dollars
for the tape.

22:12.287 --> 22:15.246
- You think I'd take your money?
- Yes, I do.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.987
I know girls like you.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.598
You act like
money's not important

22:18.685 --> 22:20.730
but the truth is
money's important to everyone.

22:20.817 --> 22:23.254
And I thought
Blair was manipulative.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.693
Blair's an amateur.
She thinks you're just like her.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.434
To Blair,
this money is a couple of pairs

22:28.521 --> 22:30.697
of Manolos and a Chanel bag.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.177
But I know that this much cash

22:33.264 --> 22:35.136
can make a real difference
in your life.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.965
[music continues]

22:46.277 --> 22:48.367
- You're sick.
- You're welcome.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.502
[Gossip Girl]
Who knew B and C
were such patrons of the arts?

22:53.589 --> 22:56.070
Call it philanthropy
or bribery.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.377
It looks like
everyone has their price.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.206
[indistinct chattering]

23:04.165 --> 23:06.297
- Something on your mind, Lily?
- Uh..

23:06.385 --> 23:08.125
[cell phone ringing]

23:09.213 --> 23:12.478
Yeah?
What are you saying?

23:14.218 --> 23:15.524
I'm sorry, it's Sheldon.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.439
He has those numbers
I was asking for.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.007
- Do you mind?
- No.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.749
Yeah. Just make sure
he gets it at the current rate.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.273
The dollar's been
all over the place.

[cell phone ringing]

23:58.175 --> 23:59.438
Hello.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.441
I was thinking about
what you said.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.790
Let's do it.

24:03.877 --> 24:04.878
'Let's see what we are.'

24:04.965 --> 24:07.010
Let's see what we could be.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.490
Who is this?

24:08.577 --> 24:09.622
Rufus.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.319
[laughs]

24:11.406 --> 24:14.104
Lily, this is great.
Do you know how great this is?

24:14.191 --> 24:17.151
Well, yes. I mean, I, I do.
I-I mean, I think so.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.283
Let's go away tonight, let's
pack a bag and let's get away

24:19.370 --> 24:20.763
from everyone, everything,
just figure it out.

24:20.850 --> 24:24.550
- Wh-where would we go?
- 'Who cares?'

24:24.637 --> 24:26.247
Okay, sounds like a plan.

24:26.334 --> 24:30.077
Um...90th and 5th. 6 o'clock?

24:30.164 --> 24:31.295
Okay.

24:31.382 --> 24:33.428
I'm scared, Rufus.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.821
'In a good way.'

24:34.908 --> 24:36.257
Me too.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.000
[sighs]

24:43.351 --> 24:45.266
[Queller]
Settle down, please.
Yesterday I talked about..

24:45.353 --> 24:47.355
Proof. Worth every penny.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.531
[Queller]
'...consequences for your
dishonorable action'

24:49.618 --> 24:52.360
and obviously,
you didn't believe me.

24:52.447 --> 24:57.365
But someone came forward today
and claimed responsibility.

24:57.452 --> 25:01.412
- Do you know who?
- For a crime he did not commit.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.372
And although I appreciate
his self-sacrifice..

25:04.459 --> 25:07.244
...I don't abide dishonesty.

25:07.331 --> 25:11.901
And I think it's time
you all know how serious I am.

25:11.988 --> 25:15.557
Nathaniel Archibald
is suspended from St. Jude's.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.951
And, yes, this will
go on his transcript.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.083
Effective immediately.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.173

'...you know
where to find the exit.'

[Gossip Girl]
This just in. Nate Archibald,
dead man walking.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.664
We hear St. Jude's
has a new policy

25:35.751 --> 25:37.623
an eye for a lie.

25:37.710 --> 25:41.714
Watch him go, students.
Who wants to be next?

25:41.801 --> 25:44.325
Until one of you comes forward,
we'll keep going

25:44.412 --> 25:48.111
'until every last one of you
has walked out that door.'

25:52.551 --> 25:55.466
[indistinct chattering]

25:59.383 --> 26:01.255
- I don't believe this.
- Dan, it's okay.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.039
Serena, I, I can't,
I can't get expelled.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.693
I cannot get suspended.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.782
My whole future
is riding on this.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.045
If you know who broke in,
then why won't you give them up?

26:13.049 --> 26:14.921
Because it was me.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.407
So why didn't you
tell me right away?

26:23.494 --> 26:25.496
Because I didn't want you
to judge me.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.021
Aren't we already beyond that?

26:28.108 --> 26:29.805
And I didn't want you to know

26:29.892 --> 26:31.764
because I didn't want you
to have to be in the position

26:31.851 --> 26:33.896
you're in now
of having to choose between

26:33.983 --> 26:36.333
protecting me
and helping yourself.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.509
- So how'd you even get in?
- I have a key.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.207
You have a key to the pool?

26:40.294 --> 26:42.862
Alright, what happened
to being beyond this?

26:42.949 --> 26:44.167
Sorry.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.387
The end of freshman year,
I..

26:46.474 --> 26:48.389
...kind of dated
the swim team captain

26:48.476 --> 26:50.347
and he gave me a key,
so that we could..

26:50.434 --> 26:51.566
...you know, meet up, and--

26:51.653 --> 26:53.002
That's enough said.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.917
Saturday night,
what happened then?

26:55.004 --> 26:57.485
Well, Blair and I ran out
of places to go

26:57.572 --> 27:01.271
and she knew I still had a key,
and...before I knew it

27:01.358 --> 27:02.751
it's like we were all there.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.361
And I thought it was
just gonna be us girls.

27:04.448 --> 27:05.798
And then everybody
got on their phone

27:05.885 --> 27:09.105
and more people
started showing up, and..

27:09.192 --> 27:12.456
[sighs]
...I just never thought
anybody was gonna get hurt.

27:12.543 --> 27:15.068
Yeah. Well, you can still
tell Queller the truth.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.373
I think she'll respect
your honesty.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.810
Yeah, like she respected Nate's?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.986
No, Nate lied.

27:20.073 --> 27:22.423
And besides,
you're Serena van der Woodsen.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.555
You didn't know me
before I went away.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.734
I barely got back
into Constance.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.693
If I got expelled,
I don't think

27:31.780 --> 27:34.609
any school in town
would take me.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.219
I'm sure that's not true.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.265
I can't risk going back
to boarding school.

27:39.527 --> 27:42.138
Being away from you and Eric.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.314
But I don't want you
to lose your future.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.449
Wow.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.843
Oh, wow, you really can be..

27:50.930 --> 27:54.716
...damned if you do
and screwed if you don't.

- Hey.
- Are you okay?

28:09.252 --> 28:11.602
Yeah, I'll be fine.
It's uh..

My parents have so much
other stuff going on right now.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.085
They'll get over it.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.740
- Either way, it was worth it.
- Worth it?

28:18.827 --> 28:21.134
Yes, Blair, I know how much
your future means to you.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.831
I mean, you've worked so hard
for Yale and everything--

28:22.918 --> 28:25.878
- What are you talking about?
- You don't have to lie.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.488
I saw the key in your bedroom.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.925
[scoffs]
That key isn't mine.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.319
I was just hiding it
for someone else.

28:33.755 --> 28:38.368
Wait.
That's why you were suspended?

28:38.455 --> 28:39.761
You told the headmistress
it was yours

28:39.848 --> 28:41.720
because you thought
it was mine?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.899
That's the most romantic thing
anyone has ever done for me.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.033
I love you.

happen right now.

Not yet.

Your position at that school

29:15.884 --> 29:17.364
is already too precarious.

and you know what?

anything to help you.'

under the covers'

'and make it all go away.'

a little spa trip
for the weekend.

- No, I don't think so.

Mom...is Dan's dad the reason

29:59.493 --> 30:01.364
you haven't answered
Bart's proposal?

30:08.110 --> 30:09.982
You can't.

30:11.113 --> 30:13.159
Please, mom, not this one.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.901
Look, I will not abase
my personal life

30:15.988 --> 30:17.250
on your preferences.

30:17.337 --> 30:20.340
Dan is my boyfriend.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.298
And I know we're too young
to talk about forever

30:22.385 --> 30:23.952
but right now,
that's what it feels like.

30:24.039 --> 30:27.216
- I know it does, sweetie, but--
- But what?

30:27.303 --> 30:30.176
Tell me that Rufus
is that important to you.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.873
Tell me that
whatever the two of you have

30:31.960 --> 30:34.833
is the most important thing
in your life.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.791
Because that's what
Dan is to me, mom.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.403
The most important.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.669
I would rather be Chuck's
stepsister than Dan's.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.891
Please don't do this to me.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.850
Dan means that much to you?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.592
Yeah, he does.

There's something I have to do.

And I hope there's something
you have to do too.

What are you doing here?

31:21.575 --> 31:24.273
- I brought this for you.
- What's the catch?

31:24.360 --> 31:25.753
I know this might
come as a shock

31:25.840 --> 31:28.451
but not everyone
operates from an agenda.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.279
In fact,
some people do things simply

31:30.366 --> 31:33.152
because it's the decent thing
to do.

31:33.239 --> 31:36.459
Smash it, burn it, whatever.
There are no copies.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.287
What about the one
you gave to Chuck?

31:38.374 --> 31:42.291
It's blank, which I'm sure
he'll be thrilled to discover.

31:42.378 --> 31:43.814
And about what's on that tape

in your natural habitat

one of the good guys.

you have a partial scholarship'

You are number two
in your class.

Have a stellar recommendation
for Dartmouth from J.L. Hall.

are well within your grasp.

Thank you, thank you.
Yeah, I guess they are.

But it seems you're in
with a new crowd this year.

32:16.412 --> 32:20.112
- Dating Serena van der Woodsen.
- Is that on my file?

32:23.115 --> 32:24.986
Who had the key to the school?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.250
I don't know.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.558
Let me remind you
one last time

32:31.645 --> 32:33.516
that you are in a different
position than the others.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.691
You need this school.

I have something to tell you.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.834
[instrumental music]

32:52.144 --> 32:53.623
I must say your file reads
more like a rap sheet.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.495
You cut more sophomore classes
than you attended

32:55.582 --> 32:58.541
cheated on tests,
talked back to teachers.

32:58.628 --> 33:01.327
Look, I understand that
this is a serious matter.

33:01.414 --> 33:03.720
That's why it's important
to me that you know..

33:03.807 --> 33:05.940
...you being new here,
that the person

33:06.027 --> 33:08.203
that you just described
is not who I am anymore.

33:08.290 --> 33:11.380
Oh, no?

33:11.467 --> 33:14.644
- Who are you now?
- Well, my grades are up.

and I've stayed out of trouble.
