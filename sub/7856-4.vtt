CHURCH BELL RINGS

00:08.179 --> 00:09.779
Uncle Mirth, wait!

00:12.259 --> 00:13.419
They're here to help you.

00:19.739 --> 00:24.379
Uncle Mirth. Please stop!
They've got me! Don't hurt him.

00:24.420 --> 00:25.420
Get off!

00:27.859 --> 00:31.260
How could you? I'm so sorry,
but you need help.

00:33.579 --> 00:36.219
Judas! I'll see you
rot in hell for this!

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.620 --> 01:16.780
Are you sure you can manage that?

01:16.819 --> 01:20.060
I'm not completely useless.

01:20.099 --> 01:21.260
Well, if you say so.

01:23.299 --> 01:24.739
Father Brown...

01:26.099 --> 01:27.579
It's from Uncle Mirth.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.219
He's been released.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.819
So he's finally
regained his sanity.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.700
And hopefully forgiven me.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.140
He's invited me
to his welcome home party.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.140
Well, after last time,
I'd stay well away.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.379
He's absolutely barking.

01:41.420 --> 01:44.060
Always insisting on people
calling him Uncle Mirth.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.259
Well, that's just his old stage name.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.780
Sorry, Mrs McCarthy.

01:51.780 --> 01:52.939
Not terribly hungry.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.299
What's the matter with you? Guilt.

01:59.740 --> 02:02.739
About the part he played in
having Uncle Mirth committed.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.700
They were very close.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.419
Father Brown, you old bloodhound...
Henry!

02:08.419 --> 02:11.099
How are you? Oh, touch of gout,

02:11.099 --> 02:13.659
kidney stones,
pickled liver, dodgy ticker.

02:13.699 --> 02:16.300
But apart from that,
a picture of health!

02:17.900 --> 02:22.900
Hello, hello, hello. Who's this?
Lady Felicia Montague.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.860
Uncle Mirth's brother.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.939
Ah. I hope your sense of humour
isn't as dark as his.

02:28.979 --> 02:31.219
Well, I did write
his signature song.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.819
# I'm loony, hooky, kooky, loopy,

02:34.860 --> 02:36.219
# I'm a crackpot

02:36.259 --> 02:38.420
BOTH: # Of the Empire! #

02:38.420 --> 02:42.099
Marvellous. I always found his
ventriloquist's dummy rather creepy.

02:42.139 --> 02:43.259
Ooh! Me too.

02:44.780 --> 02:47.819
Looks like we're going
to the same party, Father.

02:49.259 --> 02:50.259
Snap!

02:52.099 --> 02:53.099
Yes...

02:54.379 --> 02:57.139
Surely you're not
going to the party?

02:57.180 --> 02:58.780
Why not?

02:58.819 --> 03:01.580
Well, after all that's happened...

03:01.580 --> 03:04.419
it just wouldn't be right.

03:04.419 --> 03:05.300
History.

03:06.539 --> 03:07.740
The best brother won.

03:09.379 --> 03:10.379
You chose me.

03:12.419 --> 03:14.780
But Uncle Mirth
may still be very fragile.

03:14.780 --> 03:16.900
How many more times?

03:16.900 --> 03:19.060
His name's Julius.

03:19.060 --> 03:19.900
Sorry.

03:21.579 --> 03:24.300
But since his breakdown,
he hasn't seen us together.

03:28.259 --> 03:29.819
You just want to rub his nose in it.

03:31.740 --> 03:32.939
Well,

03:32.939 --> 03:34.740
I won't be a part of it.

03:34.780 --> 03:37.099
Pack a bag. Mortimer...

03:38.500 --> 03:39.740
It's not a request.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.900
I want you with me.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.460
We leave in ten minutes, darling.

04:02.180 --> 04:03.860
Despite my initial doubts,

04:03.860 --> 04:08.139
I think putting him in that place
was what he needed.

04:08.139 --> 04:10.099
He was completely burnt out.

04:11.939 --> 04:13.099
Did you visit him often?

04:14.460 --> 04:17.819
Oh. Most days. Your other brother?

04:17.860 --> 04:21.420
Mortimer. Sir Mortimer now. Oh!

04:21.459 --> 04:24.060
Never set foot in the place.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.500
Uncle Mirth mentioned
an older sister.

04:28.060 --> 04:32.100
Left when we were children,
abroad somewhere.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.420
No, I was the only family to visit.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.139
Oh, almost forgot.

04:41.259 --> 04:42.579
A proper drink, Father?

04:44.340 --> 04:47.459
A bit early, even for me.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.100
Never too early.

04:49.139 --> 04:50.980
Never too late.

04:53.819 --> 04:57.420
Port is bottled poetry.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.939
After my first visit,
he wouldn't see me.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.620
Well, in the last few weeks,
he did mention you. Did he?

05:11.860 --> 05:13.459
Said he was sorry for upsetting you.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.540
And that you did the right thing.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.860
CLAXON

05:32.579 --> 05:34.379
Sorry, honey, did I startle you?

05:34.420 --> 05:36.100
You could've killed me.

05:37.459 --> 05:38.980
It's Jacob, isn't it?

05:38.980 --> 05:41.459
You interviewed me
for Uncle Mirth's biography.

05:44.379 --> 05:45.980
You're the radio producer.

05:45.980 --> 05:47.860
So you're going to his party too?

05:47.899 --> 05:49.019
Yeah.

05:49.019 --> 05:52.019
Well, park your seat.
I'll give you a ride.

06:01.699 --> 06:04.459
So, how's the biography going?

06:04.459 --> 06:06.459
I'm hoping to pick it up
again now that he's out.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
Don't hold your breath.

06:08.540 --> 06:12.339
You do know his mother
and sister both had...problems.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.819
How did you know that?

06:15.860 --> 06:19.699
Oh, men always tell me everything.
Can't think why.

06:21.459 --> 06:24.939
Sorry about the bare feet.
Can't drive in heels.

06:32.420 --> 06:35.340
See you at the party, Father.
Bye, Henry.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.980
# I'm a crackpot of the Empire

06:37.980 --> 06:41.620
# Mad as a hatter!

06:41.620 --> 06:44.740
♪ I'm loony, hooky, kooky, loopy... ♪

06:44.779 --> 06:45.980
Oh, hello again.

06:45.980 --> 06:48.300
♪ I'm a crackpot of the Empire... ♪

06:48.340 --> 06:49.699
Thank you so much(!)

06:49.740 --> 06:51.740
HE LAUGHS

06:55.100 --> 06:57.779
Help! Someone!

06:57.779 --> 06:59.740
HE GASPS

07:01.500 --> 07:02.899
Are you all right?

07:04.939 --> 07:07.100
SHE SCREAMS

07:17.699 --> 07:20.420
With all his millions,
he buys a dump like this?

07:22.060 --> 07:23.259
Last time I interviewed him,

07:23.300 --> 07:26.259
he said he wanted to build
a centre for music hall memorabilia.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.779
Sorry, thought you needed
a helping hand.

07:37.459 --> 07:39.259
Maybe he'll finish it now he's back.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.180
DISTANT, EXAGGERATED LAUGHING

07:46.180 --> 07:48.819
What's that? Uncle Mirth?

07:48.860 --> 07:51.740
EXAGGERATED LAUGHING CONTINUES

07:56.779 --> 07:57.899
In the pocket.

07:57.899 --> 08:01.459
EXAGGERATED LAUGHING

08:01.500 --> 08:03.819
Looks like Uncle Mirth's
been playing a joke on us.

08:09.060 --> 08:11.620
It's addressed to someone
called Father Brown.

08:13.779 --> 08:16.220
He was very jolly when he left.

08:16.220 --> 08:19.459
Lady Felicia said he was holding
his chest and struggling to breathe

08:19.459 --> 08:20.939
when he collapsed.

08:20.980 --> 08:22.779
Henry wasn't in the best of shape.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.300
And a big drinker.

08:26.860 --> 08:30.899
So, "Fat alcoholic
dies of natural causes."

08:33.379 --> 08:34.340
Nice!

08:37.659 --> 08:39.100
And...simple.

08:40.179 --> 08:43.179
Just the way I like it. Sergeant!

08:43.179 --> 08:46.139
Father, are you all right?

08:46.179 --> 08:47.940
Yes.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.340
Poor Henry. You're upset.

08:50.340 --> 08:54.059
Now, maybe going to that party
is not such a good idea.

08:54.059 --> 08:56.899
I need to tell Uncle Mirth
about his brother.

08:56.940 --> 09:00.779
Well, if that's the case,
I'm going with you. Moral support.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.980
Thank you.

09:04.019 --> 09:06.419
All the doors are locked.
We can't get inside.

09:07.700 --> 09:10.379
Oh, you stupid woman!

09:10.379 --> 09:12.860
My camera's in there. Sorry.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.460
Father Brown, my dear chap.
Sir Mortimer. Good to see you.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.659
Mrs McCarthy.

09:19.659 --> 09:23.059
I'm afraid neither of my brothers
have made an appearance.

09:23.059 --> 09:25.139
Unfortunately,
I have bad news for you.

09:25.179 --> 09:27.220
Your brother Henry
died this morning.

09:27.220 --> 09:28.980
A suspected heart attack.

09:29.019 --> 09:30.820
What?! I'm so sorry.

09:34.019 --> 09:35.539
Damn fool!

09:35.539 --> 09:38.220
I told him to stop drinking.

09:38.259 --> 09:40.700
He's at the Kembleford
cottage hospital.

09:40.740 --> 09:41.740
Are you all right?

09:43.659 --> 09:44.620
Fine.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.179
I'm just glad you're here.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.419
Father Brown. This is for you.

09:57.980 --> 09:58.860
I found it over there.

10:00.940 --> 10:02.100
Well, what is it?

10:08.820 --> 10:10.059
It's a death certificate.

10:12.580 --> 10:13.899
With my name on it.

10:17.379 --> 10:18.460
Sir!

10:20.299 --> 10:23.100
He must have picked
these up this morning.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.860
They should promote
you to detective.

10:27.299 --> 10:29.179
Bill, bill...

10:34.139 --> 10:35.299
What's this?

10:38.299 --> 10:39.580
A death certificate?

10:43.100 --> 10:44.740
With Henry's name on it.

10:44.779 --> 10:46.899
"Cause of death, poison."

10:48.659 --> 10:50.860
Not looking so much
like a heart attack anymore.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.539
What? A death certificate?

10:55.539 --> 10:57.740
Father, we should
leave here immediately.

10:57.779 --> 11:00.980
Oh, don't be such a silly old woman.
I beg your pardon?

11:01.019 --> 11:03.539
I don't think you should
speak to a lady like that.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.019
Steady, tiger.

11:05.059 --> 11:07.340
All I'm saying is that
it's typical Julius,

11:07.340 --> 11:10.019
playing jokes on his
family and friends.

11:10.019 --> 11:11.580
I'm not so sure.

11:11.580 --> 11:14.019
He's always had
a warped sense of humour.

11:14.059 --> 11:15.220
He'll pop up in a minute.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.659
Laughing at us all.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.340
Father.

11:25.379 --> 11:27.259
Do you really think
it's from Uncle Mirth?

11:29.460 --> 11:31.460
Why would he do this?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.700
It's clear he's
as mad as ever he was.

11:33.740 --> 11:36.139
And he still bears you a grudge.

11:36.179 --> 11:37.340
Remember...

11:37.379 --> 11:39.659
I had to tell them
where you were hiding.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.659
When you had a breakdown,

11:42.659 --> 11:45.059
I thought you might do
something terrible to yourself.

11:53.259 --> 11:55.059
Are you sure you want to stay?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.100
Yes.

11:58.139 --> 11:59.299
I owe it to Uncle Mirth...

12:00.659 --> 12:01.620
..to try and help him.

12:03.580 --> 12:05.179
SIR MORTIMER: Another one!

12:12.059 --> 12:14.019
Another one. What did I tell you?

12:14.059 --> 12:16.379
My brother is as nutty
as a fruitcake.

12:16.379 --> 12:17.580
Where did you find it?

12:17.620 --> 12:21.580
I found it on the bottom step.
Didn't you find the other one too?

12:21.620 --> 12:25.379
What are you saying? That I'm
somehow in on Uncle Mirth's joke?

12:25.379 --> 12:26.820
No. Sorry.

12:28.019 --> 12:29.340
That door's open.

12:30.779 --> 12:32.899
I've had enough
of playing silly beggars...

12:32.899 --> 12:36.899
Excuse me!
Maybe we shouldn't go up...

12:39.340 --> 12:40.340
Julius!

12:41.659 --> 12:42.980
Are you up there?

12:44.620 --> 12:46.379
Well, he's bound to be
up here somewhere.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.100
He's not in there.
He must be here somewhere.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.019
Julius!

13:11.460 --> 13:14.379
Come out, you bloody fool!

13:14.379 --> 13:18.259
Always loved hide and seek.
Something about dark corners.

13:19.460 --> 13:20.539
Uncle Mirth?

13:22.019 --> 13:23.779
His name's Julius.

13:46.580 --> 13:48.259
If you ever need to chat
about Henry...

13:48.299 --> 13:49.820
Oh, thank you, Father.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.500
If I'm honest, we were never close.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.899
Perhaps he got
a death certificate too.

13:55.940 --> 13:58.980
Look, there's nothing sinister
about all of this.

13:58.980 --> 14:02.259
Julius once had an obituary
printed in the paper,

14:02.299 --> 14:04.500
telling everyone he'd died.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.580
I remember that.
It's all about craving attention.

14:09.539 --> 14:10.659
Creating an audience.

14:11.860 --> 14:12.980
JACOB: Over here!

14:22.059 --> 14:23.100
It's been locked!

14:25.220 --> 14:28.019
Did you see anyone? No.

14:28.019 --> 14:29.740
Why did you even try the door?

14:30.860 --> 14:33.700
I just came round the corridor
and saw it was closed.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.779
So, you're accusing him now?
What is it with you?

14:36.779 --> 14:39.379
I'm just trying
to make sense of it all.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.620
Here, let me try.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.259
It won't budge.

14:45.299 --> 14:48.500
There must be another way out.
We need to search all the rooms.

14:56.019 --> 14:59.580
This is looking less and less
like an Uncle Mirth joke.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.820
I do not like this one little bit.
No.

15:14.740 --> 15:16.340
Father Brown, look.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.019
And greetings to you, Mr Kafka.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.740
Don't suppose you know
the way out of here, do you?

15:26.340 --> 15:29.299
One of Uncle Mirth's
hilarious pranks, no doubt.

15:30.580 --> 15:35.019
Do you know? I have always wondered
how these things work.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.220
Me too.

15:46.659 --> 15:48.220
Ow!

15:48.259 --> 15:51.500
Are you all right?
Oh, it's...it's nothing.

15:54.419 --> 15:57.580
There are needles,
just inside the opening.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.620
Meant for me, no doubt.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.220
I've been to the end
of the corridor.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.500
There's no second stairway.

16:10.379 --> 16:12.820
So, how do you know my brother?

16:15.500 --> 16:18.299
He agreed to be in a radio show
I produced.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.820
We became quite close.

16:20.860 --> 16:21.940
Close?

16:25.019 --> 16:28.019
Is that how you normally
secure your bookings?

16:31.659 --> 16:33.019
Actually, it is.

16:35.419 --> 16:39.019
I've slept with so many men,
I've lost count.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.659
Dozens and dozens.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.500
You see, I'm just not fussy.

16:47.580 --> 16:49.980
But I wouldn't go near
a pig like you.

17:12.779 --> 17:14.940
Do you miss him? What?

17:16.618 --> 17:19.220
Uncle Mirth. Why would you say that?

17:19.259 --> 17:21.140
I did a lot of interviews with him.

17:22.339 --> 17:25.940
He always spoke about you. Did he?

17:25.940 --> 17:26.940
The love of his life...

17:28.500 --> 17:30.220
..who left him for his brother.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.460
Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm...

17:36.940 --> 17:39.339
I'm always saying the wrong things.
It's all right.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.059
He was convinced
you still loved him.

17:44.059 --> 17:47.660
I just couldn't take
any more, his moods.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.099
One minute up, the next...

17:50.539 --> 17:52.140
He was always close to breaking.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.779
Why Sir Mortimer?

17:58.259 --> 18:00.059
It won't be for much longer.

18:00.099 --> 18:01.859
FOOTSTEPS

18:04.299 --> 18:05.940
Any luck? Ah, afraid not.

18:11.059 --> 18:13.660
Looks like Uncle Mirth
wants us to watch something.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.500
Sir Mortimer, Eve...

18:19.779 --> 18:21.140
What is it?

18:24.420 --> 18:25.779
A film?

18:25.779 --> 18:27.779
This is becoming absurd. Shh!

18:37.859 --> 18:40.180
# I'm a crackpot of the Empire

18:40.220 --> 18:42.380
# Mad as a hatter

18:42.380 --> 18:45.099
# I'm loony, hooky, loopy, kooky!

18:45.140 --> 18:48.180
♪ I'm a crackpot of the Empire. ♪

18:52.059 --> 18:55.579
Well, thank you for attending
my welcome home party.

18:55.619 --> 18:58.980
The only thought that kept me
going in that madhouse

18:58.980 --> 19:02.420
was the thought of taking my revenge
on the people that put me in there.

19:03.660 --> 19:07.500
My two brothers and my friend,
Father Brown.

19:13.180 --> 19:14.579
Mm!

19:16.460 --> 19:18.740
I assume my brother Henry
didn't make it this far.

19:20.539 --> 19:24.539
Pathetic alcoholic, he was always
going to be the easiest to kill.

19:24.579 --> 19:29.420
A bottle of poison-laced port sent
to him will doubtless do the trick.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.299
My other brother, Sir Mortimer.

19:33.660 --> 19:36.180
You will die
from your own selfishness.

19:37.299 --> 19:38.579
And Father Brown...

19:40.059 --> 19:42.420
You will be killed
by your own curiosity.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.539
If all does not go to plan, well,

19:50.579 --> 19:52.460
you will all fall
to your death anyway.

19:54.059 --> 19:57.099
This building has been condemned

19:57.099 --> 20:00.339
and the ground
will soon give way beneath you.

20:05.619 --> 20:07.500
We're all going to die! Shut up.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.059
But it's true. We're trapped.

20:11.099 --> 20:14.539
May I remind you that we
all entered via a fire escape.

20:16.099 --> 20:19.420
So, there is another way out.
He's right.

20:19.420 --> 20:24.619
We need to slowly
and calmly search again.

20:24.619 --> 20:26.779
We've looked everywhere!

20:26.779 --> 20:28.140
Will you just button it?

20:29.380 --> 20:31.700
Check behind furniture
for anything hidden.

20:38.339 --> 20:40.099
I didn't want to believe it was him.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.180
It will be all right,
won't it, Father?

20:45.019 --> 20:46.380
Of course.

20:50.859 --> 20:52.980
Update on the dead bloke?

20:52.980 --> 20:57.619
Lady Felicia said Henry's brother is
throwing a party up at the old mill.

20:57.619 --> 21:00.299
Goes by the name of Uncle Mirth.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.420
Uncle Mirth? You having a laugh?

21:03.420 --> 21:05.099
No, sir.

21:05.140 --> 21:08.180
Sounds like
some dodgy scout master.

21:08.180 --> 21:09.619
Get the car.

21:09.619 --> 21:10.619
Please?

21:23.140 --> 21:24.579
I've found something!

21:27.900 --> 21:30.019
Looks like a goods lift.

21:30.019 --> 21:31.740
Well, there doesn't seem
to be much room.

21:31.779 --> 21:34.140
We'll have to go down one at a time.

21:34.180 --> 21:36.420
Excuse me.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.019
Why should you go first?

21:38.059 --> 21:39.740
I'm not staying here
a moment longer.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
Sir Mortimer. Wait...

21:48.420 --> 21:51.619
HE SCREAMS

21:51.660 --> 21:54.500
LIFT CRASHES

21:54.500 --> 21:55.900
No!

22:02.220 --> 22:03.819
The cables must have been cut.

22:05.059 --> 22:07.500
"You will die by
your own selfishness."

22:08.700 --> 22:11.019
Father, if this floor collapses,

22:11.019 --> 22:13.299
we'll all end up like...

22:13.299 --> 22:16.019
This place isn't condemned.

22:16.019 --> 22:17.220
Too solid. Oh.

22:24.980 --> 22:27.380
SHE SOBS

22:42.380 --> 22:43.980
I've said a prayer for him.

22:45.259 --> 22:47.859
My tears aren't for Mortimer.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.099
They're for Uncle Mirth.

22:50.740 --> 22:52.579
It's all my fault he's doing this.

22:55.140 --> 22:59.059
Leaving him caused his breakdown.

22:59.099 --> 23:00.700
It unhinged him.

23:05.619 --> 23:07.180
You are not to blame.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.019
Perhaps the asylum pushed him
over the edge.

23:11.059 --> 23:12.900
SHATTERING GLASS

23:15.140 --> 23:17.220
Mrs McCarthy, are you all right?

23:18.980 --> 23:22.299
I don't know,
I...I'm feeling most peculiar.

23:22.339 --> 23:25.460
What is it? I...I can't breathe.

23:27.019 --> 23:29.140
I think you've been poisoned. Huh?

23:36.380 --> 23:38.460
Mrs McCarthy's collapsed!

23:38.500 --> 23:40.900
EVE: There's a door. Help me!

23:43.779 --> 23:45.380
We need to find a telephone.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.460
We must be in the cellar by now.

24:12.019 --> 24:13.420
It's locked! Come on.

24:16.259 --> 24:19.099
We will a find a way out, I promise.

24:19.140 --> 24:20.500
Mrs McCarthy?

24:28.980 --> 24:31.700
Up here! We're trapped.

24:32.940 --> 24:34.019
Try that door.

24:34.019 --> 24:37.339
Mrs McCarthy needs
medical help, urgently!

24:37.380 --> 24:39.019
Hang on!

24:41.259 --> 24:42.420
It's locked, sir.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.460
We've found a door to the cellars.

24:45.460 --> 24:47.740
Can you get down there
and open it from the other side?

24:50.420 --> 24:52.220
No, this one too. Out the way.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.339
Come on!

25:08.099 --> 25:09.740
Goodbye, Father.

25:21.099 --> 25:22.900
HE SOBS

25:37.500 --> 25:38.500
Thank you, Doctor.

25:42.859 --> 25:44.619
Well?

25:44.660 --> 25:45.859
See for yourself.

25:52.339 --> 25:54.980
This is the worst cup of tea
I've ever had.

25:55.019 --> 25:58.700
You'll need to let the pot stand for
at least two minutes before pouring.

26:00.940 --> 26:04.180
The first death certificate
was found over there.

26:04.180 --> 26:06.339
Was it really necessary
to bring us back?

26:06.380 --> 26:08.420
Need to get a clear picture.

26:08.420 --> 26:12.059
Now, what I don't understand
is why you three were invited?

26:12.059 --> 26:14.019
I mean, you weren't
the intended victims.

26:15.099 --> 26:18.420
Uncle Mirth was a showman.
He always craved an audience.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.900
And with me a producer
and Jacob a writer,

26:20.900 --> 26:24.220
he knew we'd tell his story
to an even bigger audience.

26:24.259 --> 26:27.339
It was Sir Mortimer
who insisted I come.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.259
Show me where you found
the second one.

26:35.019 --> 26:36.259
You said yesterday...

26:37.859 --> 26:40.740
..about not being with
Sir Mortimer for much longer.

26:40.740 --> 26:42.099
Well, I...

26:42.140 --> 26:45.339
I just meant that
I was planning to leave him.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.619
Surely you don't think
I had anything to do with...?

26:49.660 --> 26:50.619
Of course not.

26:56.339 --> 26:58.299
I'm so pleased
you're feeling better, Mrs M.

26:58.339 --> 27:01.420
I'm absolutely fine.
No need for all this fuss.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.500
You were poisoned.

27:03.660 --> 27:05.740
The needles in the dummy
were doused in it.

27:05.779 --> 27:08.019
Thank goodness the inspector
got you here in time.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.259
A repellent little man,
to say the least.

27:11.259 --> 27:13.299
But you can't fault what he did.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.420
The poison was meant for me.

27:15.859 --> 27:17.059
I'm so sorry.

27:17.059 --> 27:18.059
Don't be silly, Father!

27:19.900 --> 27:23.140
The inspector wants me
back at the mill now.

27:23.180 --> 27:26.779
But...let me cook lunch for you.

27:26.819 --> 27:29.460
Oh! Lovely.

27:30.299 --> 27:34.019
In the meantime,
please try and get some rest.

27:34.059 --> 27:35.700
I'll look after her, Father.

27:35.740 --> 27:38.579
I'm not an invalid.
I don't need looking after.

27:38.579 --> 27:41.420
Now, you're not going to be a
difficult patient, are you, Mrs M?

27:41.420 --> 27:44.660
'My other brother, Sir Mortimer,

27:44.700 --> 27:47.299
'you will die from
your own selfishness.

27:48.539 --> 27:50.740
'And Father Brown..'

27:50.779 --> 27:53.420
You will be killed
by your own curiosity.

27:57.619 --> 28:00.380
'If all does not go to plan,
well,

28:00.420 --> 28:02.700
'you will all fall
to your death anyway.'

28:02.700 --> 28:03.940
You're not allowed up here.

28:03.980 --> 28:05.420
'This building has been...'

28:05.420 --> 28:07.859
I thought you wanted to see me.
Too late now.

28:09.660 --> 28:11.099
Got what I needed from the others.

28:14.539 --> 28:17.180
Dusty cellar. So...

28:18.220 --> 28:19.779
Any sign of Uncle Mirth?

28:19.819 --> 28:22.579
Not that it's any of your business,

28:22.619 --> 28:24.460
but that maniac
is still on the loose.

28:25.740 --> 28:28.140
That maniac might be an ill man.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.420
Tell that to the twisted corpse
of Sir Mortimer.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.220
On the screen,

28:35.259 --> 28:38.380
I thought I noticed
Uncle Mirth flinch

28:38.420 --> 28:40.299
when we heard that click.

28:42.339 --> 28:43.980
A click?

28:44.019 --> 28:47.779
Could have been anything -
door, window, light switch...

28:47.819 --> 28:48.779
Or a gun.

28:50.539 --> 28:52.500
Perhaps he made
his speech under duress...

28:52.539 --> 28:54.740
YELLS: Are you trying to tell me
how to do my job?

28:54.779 --> 28:55.980
No, I... Good.

28:57.180 --> 29:00.819
Now get out of here before I arrest
you for being a pain in the backside.

29:09.339 --> 29:11.259
Well, I certainly would.

29:14.299 --> 29:19.099
Oh, come on, don't tell me
it hasn't crossed your mind.

29:19.140 --> 29:22.539
At a time like this, how can
you even think about such things?

29:25.019 --> 29:27.660
Wouldn't be the first time
we've both liked the same man.

29:29.460 --> 29:30.619
You mean Uncle Mirth?

29:34.500 --> 29:38.380
So Mr Writer, fancy another ride?

29:38.420 --> 29:40.059
Uh, no, thank you.

29:40.099 --> 29:43.019
The sergeant's giving me a lift.
Jacob...

29:43.019 --> 29:45.299
During your research
for Uncle Mirth's biography,

29:45.339 --> 29:47.779
did you discover
what happened to his sister?

29:47.779 --> 29:48.940
She was unhinged.

29:50.339 --> 29:52.579
She died abroad last year.

29:52.619 --> 29:54.619
Suspected suicide.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.619
So...

29:57.140 --> 29:59.619
His siblings are dead
and he's missing.

29:59.660 --> 30:03.220
You think it's some kind of
vendetta against the family?

30:03.220 --> 30:06.059
Possibly. But you were named
in the film footage, Father.

30:07.380 --> 30:08.460
Mm...

30:08.500 --> 30:10.380
Yes, I was.

30:11.579 --> 30:14.019
Yes, sir, we've searched
the surrounding areas.

30:14.059 --> 30:15.779
But there's no sign of Uncle Mirth.

30:15.819 --> 30:18.220
He's not going to stay around
waiting to be caught, is he?

30:18.259 --> 30:21.259
Let's search Kembleford
and the surrounding area.

30:21.299 --> 30:22.259
Yes, sir.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.500
HE CLICKS HIS TONGUE

31:57.220 --> 31:58.180
Ah!

32:48.619 --> 32:50.380
Old, dusty.

32:54.779 --> 32:55.819
New.

33:12.859 --> 33:13.940
Uncle Mirth.

33:16.779 --> 33:19.220
SNORING

33:21.900 --> 33:22.859
Oh, yeah.

33:25.339 --> 33:28.339
Oh! Outrageous.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.940
SHE SNORES LOUDLY
Ah!

33:37.539 --> 33:40.339
What was that? Nothing.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.380
Just the gentle rumblings
of a combine harvester.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.220
You're looking a little flushed.

33:45.220 --> 33:47.660
It's rather hot in here.
Can we open the window?

33:49.980 --> 33:53.140
Heavens above, look at the time.
And where's Father Brown got to?

33:53.180 --> 33:54.539
Well, he hasn't come back yet.

33:54.579 --> 33:57.220
You know what he's like,
he's probably sleuthing somewhere.

33:57.220 --> 33:59.220
He said he was going
to prepare the luncheon.

33:59.259 --> 34:01.259
And he never misses a meal.

34:01.299 --> 34:04.700
And now...now I'm hungry
and worried.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.579
You're safe now.
I'll get you some help.

34:10.579 --> 34:12.780
GUN CLICKS

34:17.139 --> 34:18.820
I was wondering when you'd turn up.

34:21.980 --> 34:25.260
You framed Uncle Mirth
for his brothers' murders,

34:25.260 --> 34:29.900
set up the sick jokes in
keeping with his public pranks

34:29.940 --> 34:31.460
and invited people to witness them.

34:33.179 --> 34:34.780
But Uncle Mirth,

34:34.820 --> 34:37.340
who is not as comical
as you may think,

34:37.340 --> 34:39.018
left a number of clues
to your identity.

34:40.099 --> 34:42.260
All right, I'll say what you want.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.179
I'll need a drink first.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.380
While your back was turned,
he put a pin in the globe.

35:03.019 --> 35:03.980
Ireland.

35:05.260 --> 35:06.699
And the beverage he chose.

35:07.900 --> 35:08.900
Irish stout.

35:16.019 --> 35:17.780
I saw you hiding
in the grounds, Father.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.139
How did you know where he was?

35:22.780 --> 35:24.019
Dusty cellar.

35:29.019 --> 35:31.659
Dust, from the cellar.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.780
Immured, walled in.

35:38.099 --> 35:39.460
Nasty death, suffocation.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.219
It's a ventilation shaft.

35:50.019 --> 35:51.019
So...

35:52.539 --> 35:55.780
Your pose
as Uncle Mirth's biographer

35:55.820 --> 35:58.260
was just a ploy to get information?

35:59.300 --> 36:00.699
If you're not a writer...

36:03.179 --> 36:04.179
..who are you?

36:07.179 --> 36:09.420
Another crackpot of the Empire.

36:12.019 --> 36:13.099
The Empire?

36:15.460 --> 36:18.340
Ah, the family.

36:19.619 --> 36:21.099
Is this all about inheritance?

36:22.380 --> 36:23.300
Yep.

36:24.699 --> 36:25.940
Did you put me in your will?

36:27.139 --> 36:28.619
He...

36:28.659 --> 36:31.179
he said he was indebted
to you for helping him.

36:32.780 --> 36:36.460
So with me and the brothers dead,
you stood to inherit everything.

36:39.420 --> 36:41.500
All right,
it's time you were told the truth.

36:44.820 --> 36:46.380
I'm your sister's son.

36:48.619 --> 36:51.099
She married an Irish labourer,

36:51.099 --> 36:52.380
but their father disowned her.

36:54.019 --> 36:55.179
She was dead to him.

36:55.219 --> 36:57.099
I... I didn't know...

36:57.099 --> 36:59.579
Oh, and that makes it right?!

36:59.619 --> 37:02.099
While you and your brothers
lived like kings,

37:02.139 --> 37:05.059
we were starving
in some rat-infested slum.

37:06.460 --> 37:09.340
But it's not their fault. Is it?

37:10.820 --> 37:12.860
As Henry said,

37:12.860 --> 37:14.860
they were children
when their sister left.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.340
This isn't about revenge!

37:18.300 --> 37:20.099
I'm taking back what my mother...

37:21.460 --> 37:22.619
What I was denied.

37:24.780 --> 37:29.260
All my life, I have fantasised about
killing them and inheriting it all.

37:29.300 --> 37:30.500
Killing them?

37:32.980 --> 37:35.460
Is the family fortune
worth that much to you?

37:36.619 --> 37:37.619
Fortune?

37:39.420 --> 37:41.260
Oh, you've no idea,
do you, Father?

37:42.500 --> 37:44.300
They're worth millions.

37:44.340 --> 37:45.500
It truly is an empire.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.099
What would your mother
think about all this?

37:57.940 --> 37:59.699
I'm doing it for her!

38:03.619 --> 38:05.099
She hung herself.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.500
She's buried in a pauper's grave.

38:12.139 --> 38:13.739
I couldn't even afford a headstone.

38:16.019 --> 38:18.579
HE SOBS

38:18.619 --> 38:19.659
I'm sorry.

38:21.179 --> 38:22.380
Well, he's not in St Mary's.

38:22.420 --> 38:24.260
I've looked everywhere
I can think of.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.179
You should go back and rest.
I am not going anywhere until I...

38:27.179 --> 38:28.340
Inspector!

38:30.699 --> 38:33.059
It's Father Brown,
he hasn't come back from the mill.

38:33.059 --> 38:34.699
Snooping around, no doubt...

38:34.699 --> 38:36.179
He might be in danger.

38:36.219 --> 38:39.300
Well, if he's not, he will be
when I get my hands on him.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.820
Goodfellow, come on.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.300
She never got over what happened.

38:50.340 --> 38:53.980
Years of depression, mental problems.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.619
She was always begging me to
take back what was rightfully hers.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.780
I promised her!

39:11.019 --> 39:12.619
And I can't let some priest ruin it.

39:15.059 --> 39:16.739
But what have you done, Jacob?

39:18.579 --> 39:19.539
Look at him.

39:21.820 --> 39:22.820
He's your uncle.

39:24.460 --> 39:25.659
I had to keep him alive until

39:25.699 --> 39:27.900
all the other beneficiaries
of the will were dead.

39:31.659 --> 39:33.820
But you must know...

39:33.860 --> 39:36.019
you won't get away with this?

39:36.019 --> 39:37.179
Won't I?

39:38.579 --> 39:41.340
"Crazy Uncle Mirth kills
Father Brown as he said he would...

39:45.539 --> 39:46.780
"..then kills himself."

39:49.579 --> 39:51.099
That'll be good enough
for the police.

39:58.820 --> 40:01.820
Please. Don't do that.

40:10.980 --> 40:12.579
This way.

40:20.500 --> 40:24.659
Please. Give me the gun. No!

40:25.619 --> 40:27.699
I have to do this.

40:27.739 --> 40:28.820
It's for my mother.

40:30.860 --> 40:33.699
But if you pull
the trigger and kill me,

40:33.739 --> 40:35.340
then he'll kill you.

40:36.579 --> 40:39.139
But if you give me the gun,

40:39.179 --> 40:40.860
I'll persuade him to put his down.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.059
I can't...

40:47.940 --> 40:49.539
That's your only option
to stay alive.

40:52.219 --> 40:53.420
Do you want to die?

41:00.099 --> 41:02.659
Uncle Mirth, please lower your gun.

41:02.659 --> 41:04.340
COCKS GUN

41:04.380 --> 41:06.820
Uncle Mirth, it is over.

41:09.219 --> 41:10.860
Don't.

41:12.539 --> 41:13.699
Please...

41:16.980 --> 41:18.980
You know this is wrong.

41:21.059 --> 41:22.980
No!

41:23.019 --> 41:24.340
Ah!

41:24.380 --> 41:25.500
MALLORY: Padre...

41:26.460 --> 41:27.699
What the...?

41:27.739 --> 41:29.019
Um...

41:31.059 --> 41:33.099
Inspector, would you
mind taking this, please?

41:33.139 --> 41:34.179
I believe it's loaded.

41:37.900 --> 41:38.900
Thank you.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.500
It's all right.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.219
It'll be all right.

41:57.739 --> 42:00.340
# I'm loony, loopy hooky, kooky!

42:00.380 --> 42:03.099
♪ I'm a crackpot of the Empire! ♪

42:06.539 --> 42:09.780
One of these days, you're
going to get killed for real.

42:09.820 --> 42:12.260
You're as mad as that lunatic
in the hospital.

42:20.179 --> 42:24.659
I just hope that Jacob hasn't pushed
Uncle Mirth back into insanity.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.659
LAUGHTER

42:34.179 --> 42:38.420
Now, what did Inspector Mallory
say to his belly button?

42:38.460 --> 42:39.420
You're under a vest!

42:41.099 --> 42:43.500
Looks sane enough to me,
back to normal.

42:43.539 --> 42:45.139
Crackpot of the Empire.

42:45.139 --> 42:48.380
Now, what do you call
a bishop when he sleepwalks?

42:48.420 --> 42:50.019
A roamin' Catholic!

42:50.059 --> 42:51.820
ALL LAUGH

42:53.579 --> 42:56.579
Why is Father Brown laughing?
Mass hysteria!

42:56.619 --> 42:59.539
ALL LAUGH

43:00.305 --> 43:06.319
