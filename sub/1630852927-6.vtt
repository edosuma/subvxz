WEBVTT

00:11.010 --> 00:15.724
The prosecution charged the faculty
of Moonkwang High School and the parents

00:15.807 --> 00:18.351
involved in the Exam Paper Leak Scandal
with obstruction of business

00:18.435 --> 00:21.146
and forwarded the case
to Yeonhwa District Court.

00:21.730 --> 00:25.483
<i>It's a corruption scandal
involving a special club named Descartes</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:29.863
<i>whose members' parents are
in the top 3% of wealth and prestige.</i>

00:29.946 --> 00:33.074
<i>The club leaked exam papers
to its members for about a year.</i>

00:33.158 --> 00:36.745
<i>As the students involved
strongly denied the charge,</i>

00:36.828 --> 00:38.663
<i>the case was forwarded</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:42.584
<i>to the Juvenile Criminal Collegiate
Division as a criminal court case--</i>

00:46.546 --> 00:49.299
Before that,
are you involved in this case at all?

00:51.259 --> 00:53.136
<i>Why are the police at our door?</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:54.429
Descartes.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.683
The final exams…
I left the group right after…

01:05.315 --> 01:06.399
<i>It's been a while,</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:08.109
Sim Eun-seok.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.826
I was going to go to the courthouse, but…

01:18.703 --> 01:19.662
Hey.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.917
Let go.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.425
Do you know how long
I've been waiting here?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.177
I clearly told you…

01:37.514 --> 01:39.474
not to show up in front of me again

01:42.227 --> 01:43.478
or that I'd kill you.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.691
Your doctor called me.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.362
Hello? Namgung I-hwan, speaking.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.822
NAMGUNG I-HWAN
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

01:53.905 --> 01:54.989
Sorry?

01:55.949 --> 01:56.991
Who?

01:57.700 --> 01:59.077
<i>He couldn't get a hold of you.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:02.122
He was worried something had happened
and asked me to find you.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.251
You haven't received
counseling for months.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.091
Are you getting any sleep?

02:13.883 --> 02:15.093
Are you eating well?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.720
You'll die if you don't.

02:20.431 --> 02:21.558
You must have forgotten.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.478
I already died

02:27.355 --> 02:28.439
five years ago.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.363
You know that.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.097
What about the police?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.516
There was a hit-and-run accident
nearby today.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.643
They were here to investigate that.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.067
Descartes?

04:37.026 --> 04:37.986
Explain.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.130
I told you not to do it!

04:59.090 --> 05:00.425
Sin-u.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.344
Are you okay, Sin-u?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.345
I'm okay.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.145
It was just once.
Last semester's final exam.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.231
He dropped out of it right away
because you opposed it so strongly.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.150
That's all.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.609
Because everyone else did it!

05:20.320 --> 05:24.324
Even the members themselves
don't know who else was in the club,

05:24.407 --> 05:27.285
except for the teaching director
who organized it all.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.705
-If we stay quiet--
-Stop talking nonsense!

05:31.622 --> 05:32.957
How can I stay quiet?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.420
I'm…

05:38.212 --> 05:41.132
I'm in charge of that case!

05:43.551 --> 05:44.552
Honey.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.596
This case

05:48.431 --> 05:49.891
was assigned to me today.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.227
Not knowing this would happen,

05:55.313 --> 05:56.898
I decided to take it on.

05:57.690 --> 05:58.733
What are you saying?

05:58.816 --> 06:00.943
The whole country is focused on this case!

06:01.027 --> 06:03.654
I can't let the people involved
get off easy!

06:04.197 --> 06:07.241
Everyone knows whose father I am.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.827
You think the teaching director
will stay quiet?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.456
If he tries to bring me down,
irritated by my decision…

06:16.626 --> 06:18.586
we're all done for.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.380
Then what's going to happen to Sin-u?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.801
He's in 12th grade now.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.683
What do we do?

06:37.313 --> 06:38.356
I handed in…

06:41.484 --> 06:42.652
my resignation today.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.289
I've been a judge for 22 years.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.085
And this is…

07:04.423 --> 07:05.550
the last case

07:07.301 --> 07:08.719
I'll be in charge of.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.227
It can't be.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.939
No. Honey.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.399
I told you.

07:21.482 --> 07:25.027
You should've listened to me!
Why didn't you?

07:28.948 --> 07:31.075
You did it because everyone else did?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.498
That's why…

07:39.500 --> 07:41.085
we ended up here.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.173
No! This can't be!

07:46.507 --> 07:51.929
What do I do? Sin-u…

07:52.013 --> 07:53.973
Honey, what do we do?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.567
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

08:25.755 --> 08:28.674
<i>It was just once.
Last semester's final exam.</i>

08:28.758 --> 08:31.802
<i>He dropped out of it right away because
you opposed it so strongly.</i>

08:31.886 --> 08:32.970
<i>That's all.</i>

08:38.226 --> 08:39.268
<i>Presiding Judge Kang.</i>

08:44.315 --> 08:46.734
Presiding Judge Kang.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.571
Yes?

08:52.281 --> 08:53.699
Where were we?

08:54.575 --> 08:56.869
You were talking
about the Moonkwang High School case.

08:56.953 --> 08:57.912
Right.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.791
The Moonkwang High School
Exam Paper Leak Scandal.

09:01.874 --> 09:06.170
A total of 21 students
will be tried by this court.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.966
Eighteen of them, six in each grade,
will be tried here.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.260
And the other three
who were on the waiting list

09:12.885 --> 09:14.637
will be handled as protection cases.

09:19.016 --> 09:21.978
The presiding judge
of this criminal case will be Judge Sim.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.063
You've checked, right?

09:24.146 --> 09:25.648
Yes, I have.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.192
Some of the parents involved

09:28.276 --> 09:29.902
are assemblymen, ministers,

09:30.736 --> 09:33.030
doctors at university hospitals,
celebrities,

09:35.324 --> 09:37.076
and even judicial officers.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.829
It won't be easy.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.457
It may put you under more pressure
than the Yeonhwa Child Murder case.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.875
I'm ready for that.

09:44.959 --> 09:49.255
So, about the three students
who were on the waiting list.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.966
To lessen the burden
of the appointed judge,

09:52.049 --> 09:54.927
Judge Cha, the associate judge,
is supposed to handle them.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.722
But unfortunately,
one of them is a juvenile

09:57.805 --> 09:59.015
you were in charge of in the past.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.474
Yes, that's right.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.519
You have to handle both the criminal case
and the protection case.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.063
Won't it be too much?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.859
I'll ask the senior presiding judge
to reassign--

10:09.942 --> 10:11.944
No, that's not a problem.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.115
I see.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.163
All right, then.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.207
It's settled then.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.250
Yes, sir.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.185
-Is the meeting over?
-Yes.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.436
Hi.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.396
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.776
Are these the documents
for the Moonkwang case?

10:51.859 --> 10:54.403
Yes. We have the ones
for the protection case first.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.822
The three students
who were on the waiting list.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.992
How should we schedule
the protection case?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.702
Well, as for me,

11:01.786 --> 11:03.996
I have other cases to look into,
so I'll get back to you.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.248
Yes, sir. What about you, Judge Sim?

11:08.584 --> 11:10.961
We'll be busy
once the criminal trial begins,

11:11.045 --> 11:12.797
so we should speed things up.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.299
I'll set a date as soon as possible,

11:15.383 --> 11:19.178
so please summon the teachers
in charge as reference witnesses.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.867
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
PROTECTION CASE HISTORY

11:45.621 --> 11:46.831
<i>I'll turn myself in.</i>

11:50.459 --> 11:52.086
It all happened because of me.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.339
Because of that scandal,

11:56.048 --> 11:57.174
I have trouble sleeping,

11:58.217 --> 11:59.510
and I was so stressed.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.806
I'm glad this happened.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.393
I'll turn myself in.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.477
Sin-u.

12:09.645 --> 12:13.274
What the heck is wrong with you?
What do you mean, you're glad?

12:13.357 --> 12:15.901
You're in 12th grade now.
What will happen if you do?

12:17.903 --> 12:22.658
-Think before you speak, for God's sake!
-Honey.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.453
I just can't understand you
no matter how hard I try!

12:27.496 --> 12:28.747
You of all people!

12:30.249 --> 12:31.542
My very own son!

12:40.050 --> 12:42.678
Don't drag your innocent father
down with you.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.557
If you want to die,

12:47.308 --> 12:48.976
go and die on your own, you punk.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.451
Presiding Judge Kang.

13:05.534 --> 13:09.121
You need to leave now to attend
the Press Arbitration Commission meeting.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.331
Okay.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.124
Let's go.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.839
Hey, Presiding Judge Kang!

13:20.174 --> 13:21.675
I'm sad to hear the news.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.887
I don't know about the others,
but I thought you'd be here longer.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.098
Presiding Judge Kang.
I heard you'll go into politics.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.727
Why are you so surprised?
The whole country knows now.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.312
What?

13:33.395 --> 13:36.273
<i>Today, the Liberty Party
nominated Kang Won-jung,</i>

13:36.357 --> 13:40.194
<i>a panel member of </i>Current Events N Issues
<i>and a judge at Yeonhwa District Court,</i>

13:40.277 --> 13:44.406

13:44.490 --> 13:47.117
<i>The Moonkwang High School

13:47.201 --> 13:49.578
<i>will be his last case
at Yeonhwa District Court…</i>

13:50.371 --> 13:52.665
Judge Sim. You should see this.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.834
It's about Presiding Judge Kang.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.504
-It's…
-What is it?

14:03.717 --> 14:07.179
JUDGE KANG OF <i>CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES</i>
TO RESIGN AND GO INTO POLITICS

14:08.430 --> 14:10.307
PRESIDING JUDGE KANG,
ON THE SET OF <i>CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES</i>

14:12.184 --> 14:13.894
<i>You may now start crossing.</i>

JUDGE KANG OF <i>CURRENT EVENTS N ISSUES</i>
ANNOUNCES FORAY INTO POLITICS

14:40.254 --> 14:42.631
-Here he comes!
-There he is!

14:44.466 --> 14:46.427
-Why are you suddenly going into politics?
-Wait a minute, Presiding Judge Kang!

14:46.510 --> 14:49.555
You're leaving the court after 22 years.
Please tell us how you feel.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.807
Are you leaving
<i>Current Events N Issues</i>, too?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.018
-Please say something, Your Honor!
-Please say a word!

14:54.101 --> 14:55.311
Presiding Judge Kang!

14:56.020 --> 14:57.438
Did you watch the news?

14:58.689 --> 14:59.773
Yes.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.276
As you know,
our ratings have dropped as of late

15:02.359 --> 15:05.613
because of
the Legislation-Judiciary Committee.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.615
I knew we could count on you.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.200
It's better than I expected.
The response is very positive.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.370
We need to pull on the oars hard
while the tide is rising.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.457
Go ahead.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.544
<i>Dad. I'm sorry.</i>

15:25.507 --> 15:29.345
The Exam Paper Leak Scandal
at Moonkwang High School.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.638
You're in charge, right?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.849
Yes, I am.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.643
Wrap it up well.

15:36.393 --> 15:39.063
And let's take this chance
to turn the tables.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.273
The National Assembly
is also paying attention.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.109
Educating our children
is an important issue,

15:44.860 --> 15:47.071
but a member of the opposition
is involved in it.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.870
<i>Politics is all about image.</i>

15:54.954 --> 15:57.039
I know you are a man of virtue,

15:57.122 --> 15:59.750
but make sure to stay
out of trouble and rumors.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.418
Just keep going

16:02.544 --> 16:04.380
as you always have been.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.383
This is the real beginning,

16:08.550 --> 16:10.010
Assemblyman Kang Won-jung.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.265
All right!

16:40.582 --> 16:42.751
You can't enter the emergency room
without an access card.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.336
I'm a guardian. My son is in there!

16:44.420 --> 16:46.380
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I said, my son is in there!

16:55.556 --> 16:56.640
Because of you…

16:57.474 --> 16:59.018
Because of you, Sin-u…

16:59.810 --> 17:01.562
Sin-u…

17:03.981 --> 17:05.941
What happened?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.818
What happened to Sin-u?

17:07.901 --> 17:10.154
YEONHWA DISTRICT

17:10.237 --> 17:12.031

17:13.824 --> 17:16.118
He ran into the street during a red light.

17:16.994 --> 17:20.456

no matter how hard I try!

18:05.334 --> 18:06.960
If you want to die,

18:15.302 --> 18:17.554
Are you happy now?

18:19.264 --> 18:21.141
Do you feel better
after pushing him to the edge?

18:22.392 --> 18:23.894
How is this my fault?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.772
You shouldn't have done it
in the first place.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.607
So what if he gets poor grades?

18:32.694 --> 18:35.864
-Why would he…
-"So what if he gets poor grades?"

18:37.407 --> 18:38.951
It was you who scolded him.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.620
Why do you think he did that?

18:41.703 --> 18:44.206
He wanted your approval and attention.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.001
You compared him to Jeong-u on a whim
and looked down on him.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.421
What?

18:55.342 --> 18:56.426
Hey.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.346
How can you eat after getting poor grades?

19:01.431 --> 19:03.016
Your brother is only in 10th grade…

19:05.018 --> 19:06.895
He got straight As.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.525
You're going to be in 12th grade soon.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.652
Do you even want to go to college?

19:15.195 --> 19:18.240
Sin-u would have gotten straight As
if he didn't make mistakes.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.950
Good students don't make mistakes.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.702
You're useless.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.163
What more could you ask for?

19:24.246 --> 19:28.208
Can we not afford your tuition?
Do we starve you?

19:28.292 --> 19:31.587
A cozy house, pocket money, cram schools,
and even private tutoring…

19:31.670 --> 19:35.382
All you need to do is study
but you can't even do that?

19:35.465 --> 19:38.468
Even though I grew up dirt poor,

19:38.552 --> 19:40.429
I won a full scholarship, you brat.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.181
That's enough, honey.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.349
Law school? Seriously?

19:45.726 --> 19:48.312
-Just forget it, you punk.
-For goodness' sake.

19:48.395 --> 19:51.899
So is that why he joined Descartes?

19:53.233 --> 19:54.693
I told him to do it.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.822
Just for English where he makes mistakes.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.286
That was the first and last time.

20:05.162 --> 20:09.124
He did it once then quit,
saying he couldn't do it anymore.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.085
You pushed him to do it.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.882
Don't get emotional on me.

20:19.176 --> 20:23.055
If we don't get emotional about our kids,
then when do you think we should?

20:24.473 --> 20:25.766
You think I don't know?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.728
His grades and college entrance
are just excuses.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.400
Your amazing career.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.071
And the assemblyman's badge
that you've been after.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.658
You pushed him
because you thought he'd ruin it for you.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.828
You were worried
about your own future, not his.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.127
Hey, how can you even…

21:06.098 --> 21:07.224
<i>But you know what?</i>

21:07.933 --> 21:10.269
<i>When the police
were at our door that night,</i>

21:11.728 --> 21:13.313
<i>the first person he called</i>

21:14.273 --> 21:15.440
<i>was you.</i>

21:19.152 --> 21:22.906
<i>Do you know what time he went to bed</i>

21:23.949 --> 21:25.659
<i>and got up for over two years?</i>

21:27.494 --> 21:29.246
He slept less than three hours a day.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.791
And he can't fall asleep
without sleeping pills.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.963
He risked his life

21:40.549 --> 21:42.259
for your approval.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.803
And to get attention from you.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.519
<i>The police said he was just standing there</i>

21:53.437 --> 21:55.230
<i>while the light changed several times.</i>

21:56.606 --> 21:59.151
<i>What could have he been thinking?</i>

22:00.027 --> 22:02.154
<i>He must have been scared.</i>

22:06.992 --> 22:08.869
<i>He must have been lonely.</i>

22:18.962 --> 22:20.797
<i>Dad, are you at work?</i>

22:21.715 --> 22:24.217
<i>Dad. I did well on my exam today.</i>

22:33.185 --> 22:34.686
<i>Did you eat, Dad?</i>

22:35.645 --> 22:38.065
<i>Are you coming home late, Dad?</i>

22:38.940 --> 22:42.319
<i>Dad, are you going to be home late?</i>

22:58.001 --> 22:59.544
<i>You were the one</i>

23:00.712 --> 23:01.838
<i>who pushed Sin-u.</i>

ASSEMBLYMAN EOM JUN-GI

24:29.217 --> 24:30.427
Hello, sir.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.181
This is Kang Won-jung.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.734
<i>Please state your name and affiliation.</i>

24:45.817 --> 24:48.361
Park Tae-su, and I'm a teacher
at Moonkwang High School.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.281
I'm Lee Seok-hyeon's homeroom teacher.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.867
Thank you

24:54.659 --> 24:56.995
for coming to court at a time like this.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.915
There were a few things
that I couldn't understand

25:01.082 --> 25:03.001
while I was reviewing the records.

25:03.084 --> 25:03.960
Okay.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.421
I won't beat around the bush.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.965
What's the reason

25:09.925 --> 25:11.801
the school did such a thing?

25:11.885 --> 25:13.762
Honestly, it's because
of the college admission rate.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.808
<i>"How many students
did the school send to SNU?"</i>

25:18.892 --> 25:20.352
<i>That's the first thing parents consider.</i>

25:21.811 --> 25:24.189
<i>The number of students
decreases every year.</i>

25:24.272 --> 25:25.315
2018 COLLEGE ADMISSION CONFERENCE

25:25.398 --> 25:27.525
<i>And the competition between schools
is getting fiercer.</i>

25:29.736 --> 25:33.281
<i>If our college admission rate drops,
a lot of parents call us to complain.</i>

25:34.616 --> 25:38.453
<i>For many years, Moonkwang was
the number one high school</i>

25:38.536 --> 25:40.538
<i>parents wanted to send their children to.</i>

25:40.622 --> 25:42.666
<i>But now, it's not even in the top five.</i>

25:42.749 --> 25:45.001
Do you all want to screw up this school?

25:45.085 --> 25:48.213
<i>At this rate, we'll be in ruin</i>

25:48.296 --> 25:50.465
<i>even though we're
a prestigious private school.</i>

25:50.548 --> 25:52.759
Last year, before the leak,
and the year before,

25:52.842 --> 25:56.221
we only sent two students to SNU
including a student who resat the test.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.015
-That's why we created Descartes.
-Then…

26:00.141 --> 26:04.062
shouldn't grades be
the criteria for letting students in?

26:04.646 --> 26:06.147
Grades? You're right.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.442
Students get good grades
when their parents are wealthy.

26:09.526 --> 26:13.029
Back in our day,
going to SNU wasn't that hard

26:13.113 --> 26:14.906
as long as you had good grades.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.700
Of course, I went to SNU myself.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.369
But these days, that's far from enough.

26:20.161 --> 26:23.415
If your parents don't support you
attentively and financially,

26:23.498 --> 26:25.500
you can't even dream of entering.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.339
No, I'll do it.

26:31.423 --> 26:36.219
<i>Seok-hyeon. I'm 100 percent sure that
this question will be on the CSAT.</i>

26:36.303 --> 26:40.598
<i>And you should be able to apply the
differentiability theorem to answer why.</i>

26:40.682 --> 26:41.850
<i>It's very important.</i>

26:41.933 --> 26:42.809
Okay.

26:44.477 --> 26:47.731
Try to read all the recommended books
on the list I sent you just now.

26:47.814 --> 26:51.526
And do volunteer work at a hospital
for about a year.

26:51.609 --> 26:52.610
Okay.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.821
And the club where students
listen to and discuss TED lectures

26:54.904 --> 26:56.614
is better than the one he's in now.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.907
Do you know what's most important…

26:57.991 --> 26:59.492
<i>To get good grades in school,</i>

26:59.576 --> 27:01.953
<i>you need to go to cram schools
for literature, English, and math,</i>

27:02.037 --> 27:04.998
<i>and get private lessons
to catch up with the cram schools.</i>

27:05.081 --> 27:08.418
<i>You also need a graduate student
to help you with your assignments.</i>

27:08.501 --> 27:12.339
<i>That's not all. You need to do volunteer
work and extracurricular activities,</i>

27:12.422 --> 27:16.551
<i>write reports on school subjects,
participate in contests, read books,</i>

27:16.634 --> 27:19.304
<i>attend admission briefings,
prepare a résumé, and practice interviews.</i>

27:23.141 --> 27:25.810
All of it requires money.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.442
Then how come no one refused
to join the club?

27:34.027 --> 27:35.820
You could do just as you always did.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.530
Because it's a competition.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.909
If I refuse,
someone else will take the spot.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.495
Why would I? For who?

27:43.578 --> 27:49.125
The top student can drop below tenth place
by just one or two points.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.795
Would you be able to refuse
if you were in my shoes?

27:53.755 --> 27:58.009
The kids got the exam papers
not because their grades were poor.

27:58.093 --> 28:02.222
They got them because it gave them
time to focus on other things.

28:03.056 --> 28:07.352
Those not in the know may call us crazy.

28:07.435 --> 28:08.478
But you know what?

28:09.396 --> 28:10.397
Your Honor.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.401
We're in the middle of a bloody war.

28:15.068 --> 28:19.030
Only thing schools are good for these days
is early admission.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.075
That's why the teaching director

28:22.158 --> 28:24.911
only chooses the students
who have what it takes to make it.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.249
By the way, when does this trial end?

28:31.042 --> 28:34.462
Seok-hyeon has
a private English lesson in an hour.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.132
I heard that this kind of trial
doesn't take too long.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.675
Was I misinformed?

28:49.686 --> 28:52.480
Have Lee Seok-hyeon's guardian
wait outside next time.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.190
I have questions only for him.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.734
Yes, I'll do that.

28:57.277 --> 29:00.196
Oh, dear. This is freaking tough.
For God's sake.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.158
Wasn't the boy's guardian pretty shocking?

29:03.241 --> 29:05.118
She didn't even pretend to reflect on it.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.079
I know. But on the other hand,

29:08.163 --> 29:12.250
I doubt if I'd be able to refuse
such an offer flat out if I were a mother.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.085
If my child had good grades.

29:14.169 --> 29:18.047
But parents don't know how suffocating
that is for their children.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.509
I may not look like it,
but I'm from the Gangnam School District.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.553
Well, of course, my mom gave up on me.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.555
You? You mean, you?

29:26.055 --> 29:28.600
What's with that look? I'm offended.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.935
I always look like this.
Got a problem with that?

29:31.811 --> 29:32.771
Jeez.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.691
The highest youth suicide rate
among OECD countries.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.110
The cost of private education
is over 20 trillion won a year.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.946
Seventy percent of teenagers in Korea
take private lessons.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.365
It's time for change.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.284
It's been long due.

29:46.367 --> 29:50.163
It was the same when I was growing up.
You took the CSAT, right?

29:50.246 --> 29:52.707
Or was it the CEST for you guys?

29:53.333 --> 29:56.169
Anyway, the result
of 12 years of education

29:56.252 --> 29:58.338
was decided by that one exam,

29:58.421 --> 30:01.341
so there was news about
student suicides every year.

30:02.008 --> 30:05.386
So they eventually changed the system.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.848
so students who did well in school
had a chance for early admission.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.308
And look where it got us.

30:10.391 --> 30:13.186
I doubt changing the system
will do anything.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.522
Do you think that's even possible?

30:16.856 --> 30:18.691
It doesn't have to change.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.611
No matter what the system is,

30:21.694 --> 30:24.405
people will still cheat,
and it'll still have side effects.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.575
But the court can at least

30:27.659 --> 30:29.619
take this chance to set standards.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.330
Like what?

30:32.413 --> 30:35.041
That no matter how cutthroat
the competition is,

30:36.042 --> 30:37.001
everyone…

30:38.169 --> 30:39.379
should be equal

30:40.296 --> 30:42.340
in front of exam papers.

30:46.886 --> 30:47.804
I agree.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.557
What's wrong is wrong.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.393
<i>This isn't right.</i>

30:53.893 --> 30:55.854
Don't put the cart before the horse.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.858
Before you withdraw from the election,

30:59.941 --> 31:02.694
you need to tell me
why you want to give up.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.405
We already made a press announcement.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.949
You can't just say you want to quit now.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.580
Well…

31:14.372 --> 31:18.084
You need to tell me why so I can
either be persuaded or persuade you.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.223
Descartes.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.434
My son…

31:36.477 --> 31:38.062
was a member of that club.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.489
And?

32:18.478 --> 32:19.812
A bowl of rice soup, please.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.826
Are you Park Hyeon-chan, the teaching
director at Moonkwang High School?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.457
Face forward and keep eating.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.211
I'm here to eat too.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.622
<i>My son is going through a hard time.</i>

33:22.250 --> 33:24.460
I thought about this for a long time.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.587
No matter how hard I think,

33:27.880 --> 33:28.840
this is…

33:30.550 --> 33:31.759
my final decision.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.636
Now…

33:34.679 --> 33:36.055
I'm going to

33:37.348 --> 33:38.599
give everything up.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.690
Is that really for the best?

33:46.190 --> 33:47.900
I'll cut to the chase.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.320
You still have to run for the election.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.366
We've already done
all the background checks

33:55.450 --> 33:57.994
and made the press announcement.
It's too late.

33:59.954 --> 34:02.081
Well, then--

34:02.165 --> 34:05.084
Think of it this way,
Presiding Judge Kang.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.296
Let's suppose that you gave everything up
and told the truth.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.298
Then what's next?

34:11.924 --> 34:15.094
The trust you've built up over the years
being on TV,

34:15.178 --> 34:17.055
and the honor you have
as a man of the law.

34:17.138 --> 34:21.642
The press will criticize you,
your son, your family,

34:21.726 --> 34:28.483
Yeonhwa District Court, and even
the judiciary your court belongs to.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.152
Can you

34:31.819 --> 34:33.988
deal with all of that?

34:36.991 --> 34:38.034
<i>I'll be impartial</i>

34:39.535 --> 34:42.830
in this trial more than any other judge.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.459
So…

34:48.211 --> 34:49.378
deny all charges.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.051
When the judge
asks you a question in court,

34:55.802 --> 34:56.969
just…

34:59.263 --> 35:00.389
say…

35:01.933 --> 35:03.392
no.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.773
No more witnesses

35:11.192 --> 35:12.902
and no more testimonies.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.740
You mustn't say anything more.

35:20.701 --> 35:21.744
<i>Presiding Judge Kang.</i>

35:21.828 --> 35:23.621
You protect your son.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.249
I'll protect the party.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.336
-Representative Eom.
-This isn't a matter of choice.

35:30.419 --> 35:31.712
It's a matter of survival.

35:33.965 --> 35:38.719
We're determined to win this by-election

35:39.428 --> 35:40.555
at any cost.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.489
<i>So do what you can now</i>

35:59.115 --> 36:00.199
<i>for your son.</i>

36:06.831 --> 36:10.293
Case number 2022 GH 2577.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.754
We'll begin the trial.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.091
The charges against the defendants

36:17.175 --> 36:21.220
are all related to the exam paper leak
at Moonkwang High School.

36:21.304 --> 36:24.223
Since all the charges are
objectively related to one another

36:24.307 --> 36:26.392
and all defendants are charged
as accomplices,

36:26.475 --> 36:29.896
the court will merge their cases
and try them together.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.288
Especially, since this case

36:48.247 --> 36:50.249
is receiving much public attention,

36:50.333 --> 36:54.462
we'll make this trial quick and thorough.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.258
The prosecution may submit
the list of evidence and witnesses.

37:14.857 --> 37:16.651
Both the prosecution and the defense

37:16.734 --> 37:19.070
have submitted
their list of witnesses to summon.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.198
I won't decide who to summon
at the trial today,

37:22.281 --> 37:25.034
but will notify you of my decision later.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.873
What do you all think about that?

37:51.435 --> 37:52.436
Hello?

37:52.520 --> 37:54.855
<i>Judge Sim.
This is assisting officer, Seo Beom.</i>

37:54.939 --> 37:56.440
Presiding Judge Kang has just finished

37:56.524 --> 37:59.694
selecting the witnesses to be heard
for the Exam Paper Leak Case.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.570
<i>Have you checked it?</i>

38:03.155 --> 38:04.073
Already?

38:04.156 --> 38:05.700
<i>Yes, but…</i>

38:06.409 --> 38:07.827
it's a bit strange.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.500
Come in.

38:19.005 --> 38:22.091
I heard you didn't select any witnesses
from the prosecution,

38:22.174 --> 38:23.884
but all from the defendants.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.804
Yes, they lacked relation to the case.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.264
What is it?

38:29.181 --> 38:31.225
Han Ji-won, the prosecution's witness,
was the first teacher

38:31.309 --> 38:33.811
to suspect the teaching director
may have leaked the papers.

38:33.894 --> 38:36.480
Other faculty members
are also important witnesses.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.773
If you won't summon them,

38:37.857 --> 38:40.359
you shouldn't take any witnesses
put forward by the defense as well.

38:40.443 --> 38:44.530
Are you suggesting
that my witness selection is biased?

38:46.157 --> 38:47.074
Yes.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.744
I don't understand, sir.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.787
What are you going to do then?

38:58.210 --> 38:59.462
What was that noise?

38:59.545 --> 39:01.839
Gosh. Is your baby okay?

39:01.922 --> 39:03.174
Yes, it's okay.

39:10.097 --> 39:11.599
How arrogant.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.769
I know I've let you have your way,

39:16.062 --> 39:17.813
but there is a limit to my patience.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.732
Okay?

39:30.159 --> 39:31.035
Hello?

39:31.118 --> 39:33.329
<i>Honey, Sin-u regained consciousness.</i>

39:33.412 --> 39:35.831
<i>He'll be moved to a general ward soon.</i>

39:40.127 --> 39:43.255
Okay, I'll call you again in a bit.

39:53.599 --> 39:54.767
Get out.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.712
One of my picture frames broke.
Take care of that.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.047
Yes, sir. See you.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.257
See you.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.311
I think you went too far.

40:39.395 --> 40:41.313
He's been quite sensitive lately.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.901
-That's more the reason to ask why.
-He probably had his reasons.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.863
He can't be corrupted.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.489
How do you know that?

40:51.115 --> 40:53.159
You must not know.

40:54.535 --> 41:00.541
<i>He's gotten a bit softer since he's
now on TV and many people recognize him,</i>

41:02.042 --> 41:03.669
but he used to be quite famous

41:04.336 --> 41:06.547
for being rigid when it comes to judgment.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.467
People even joked

41:10.009 --> 41:12.928
that if the high-ranking officials
he put in prison are lined up,

41:13.012 --> 41:15.806
they'd circle the entire courthouse.

41:19.477 --> 41:23.189
I can vouch for him since I've seen him
for a year before you arrived.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.818
<i>He's fairer than anyone in the court.</i>

41:29.111 --> 41:30.404
<i>I can assure you.</i>

41:39.121 --> 41:40.289
<i>But why?</i>

41:42.333 --> 41:44.668
<i>Why is he like this now?</i>

42:13.364 --> 42:16.617
Where's Presiding Judge Kang
and Judge Sim? They're late for work.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.787
Actually, they called me.

42:19.870 --> 42:23.082
They said they'd be late today
for personal reasons.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.416
I see.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.001
Are they sick or something?

42:26.585 --> 42:27.461
I don't know.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.674
They were never late before.
What happened to them?

42:56.365 --> 42:57.575
<i>Are you getting any sleep?</i>

42:58.158 --> 42:59.577
Are you eating well?

43:00.661 --> 43:02.246
You'll die if you don't.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.039
You must have forgotten.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.710
I already died

43:09.628 --> 43:10.796
<i>five years ago.</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:40.409
<i>Do you feel wronged?</i>

43:41.452 --> 43:42.578
<i>What about?</i>

43:43.662 --> 43:46.040
It's not like I saw the leaked paper.

43:46.123 --> 43:49.043
I was just on the waiting list.
Why do I have to stand trial?

43:51.253 --> 43:52.212
Right.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.133
Then you shouldn't have
even been on the waiting list.

43:57.593 --> 43:58.844
Do whatever you want.

43:58.927 --> 44:00.846
This is a protection case anyway.

44:01.930 --> 44:03.849
It only sucks for the ones who got caught.

44:10.564 --> 44:11.482
What?

44:13.192 --> 44:17.029
Call Moonkwang High School and tell them
to send us a list of enrolled students,

44:17.112 --> 44:19.031
their student records,
and all the answer sheets

44:19.114 --> 44:21.784
other than those
the prosecution presented as evidence.

44:21.867 --> 44:24.036
Wait, Judge Sim. All of them?

44:24.119 --> 44:25.579
Yes, all the current students.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.956
-Hurry.
-Yes, ma'am.

44:38.550 --> 44:39.510
PRESIDING JUDGE KANG WON-JUNG

44:40.094 --> 44:41.136
Hello, Presiding Judge Kang.

44:43.597 --> 44:45.307
The documents?

44:46.308 --> 44:50.688
Yes, I checked the bookcase.
They aren't there.

44:52.773 --> 44:53.857
Yes, I see.

44:54.566 --> 44:57.486
Then I'll look for it again
and call you back.

Bye.

"2001 Busan Family Court"?

45:28.350 --> 45:30.811
Hello, sir. Yes, I found it.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.314
To General Affairs now? Okay.

45:47.703 --> 45:51.498
Judge Sim. These are the lists of
enrolled students, their student records,

45:51.582 --> 45:53.500
and the answer sheets you requested.

45:54.251 --> 45:56.587
The school told me repeatedly
that they'd be in trouble

45:56.670 --> 45:58.338
if the parents found out about this.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.091
There are certain procedures
the court has to follow.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.551
Okay, thank you.

46:02.634 --> 46:04.052
By the way, Judge Sim.

46:04.136 --> 46:07.055
I got you these because you wanted them,

46:07.139 --> 46:08.974
but why do you need them?

46:10.767 --> 46:13.520
Is it because of that
testimony from earlier?

What are you saying?

46:27.701 --> 46:30.245
There are more students
who saw the leaked papers?

46:30.829 --> 46:31.830
Exactly.

46:33.165 --> 46:35.083
<i>It only sucks for the ones who got caught.</i>

46:38.504 --> 46:39.379
What?

46:39.463 --> 46:41.131
It's not 21 students.

46:41.215 --> 46:43.675
There are more students
who saw those exam papers.

46:47.346 --> 46:49.765
You can trust me and leave it to me.

46:49.848 --> 46:51.099
Twenty-four.

46:52.559 --> 46:55.270
Only those with good enough grades
can join Descartes.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.189
I definitely heard him.

46:57.272 --> 47:01.985
He was on the phone when I went to ask him
when my turn would come.

47:02.069 --> 47:03.487
He said there were 24 students.

47:04.905 --> 47:07.449
I don't know who they are,
but I'm telling you.

47:07.533 --> 47:09.034
There are more kids.

47:09.117 --> 47:11.995
I told the police too,
but they didn't believe me.

47:12.621 --> 47:13.830
Unbelievable.

47:13.914 --> 47:14.873
I know.

47:16.041 --> 47:17.125
Let's see

47:18.252 --> 47:19.878
if it's true or not.

47:20.546 --> 47:22.130
But what can we do with these?

47:23.048 --> 47:27.177
They're just a list of enrolled students,
their student records,

47:27.261 --> 47:28.595
and the answer sheets.

47:31.014 --> 47:33.016
NO STUDENTS ALLOWED DURING MIDTERMS

<i>The Exam Paper Leak Case
could have been just a rumor.</i>

47:46.822 --> 47:48.991
<i>But how did it move
the Office of Education</i>

47:49.074 --> 47:50.701
<i>and even the prosecution?</i>

47:52.411 --> 47:53.704
PERSONAL INFORMATION
HAN JI-WON

47:53.787 --> 47:54.830
She is…

47:54.913 --> 47:57.249
One of the witnesses
Presiding Judge Kang refused to select.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.836
The first person to suspect
Descartes of leaking exam papers.

48:00.919 --> 48:02.546
Han Ji-won, an English teacher.

48:05.090 --> 48:07.884
<i>All six students
who got this question wrong</i>

48:07.968 --> 48:10.387
<i>have the highest grades at the school.</i>

48:11.096 --> 48:15.142
<i>But what's funny is the question
they all got wrong was super easy.</i>

48:15.225 --> 48:18.103
<i>They could have gotten it right
if they had read the text.</i>

48:19.146 --> 48:20.147
Of course,

48:20.230 --> 48:23.483
top students
can also get easy questions wrong.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.569
Anyone can make mistakes during exams.

48:26.236 --> 48:27.362
But it's impossible

48:28.238 --> 48:30.282
for someone to come up
with an answer like this

48:32.159 --> 48:33.994
no matter what mistake they make.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.038
Because the answer they gave

48:37.247 --> 48:39.458
is completely unrelated to the question.

48:42.169 --> 48:44.504
SHORT-ANSWER SECTION

48:45.964 --> 48:47.215
<i>Isn't it strange?</i>

48:47.299 --> 48:51.345
<i>How could six students write the
exact same wrong answer?</i>

48:51.428 --> 48:53.388
SHORT-ANSWER SECTION

48:53.472 --> 48:54.431
<i>What are you…</i>

48:56.266 --> 49:00.771
The exam questions had been
changed once during preparation.

49:01.521 --> 49:04.566
But they forgot to change the answers.

49:04.650 --> 49:06.943
It was just this question
that was changed.

49:07.027 --> 49:09.196
And these six students

49:09.279 --> 49:12.199
gave the answer to the question
that used to be on the test.

49:14.451 --> 49:16.036
<i>Are you saying</i>

49:16.536 --> 49:18.747
<i>that the answers were leaked
as well as the questions?</i>

49:18.830 --> 49:21.416
No. What actually happened here was

49:23.126 --> 49:24.544
that the answers were leaked,

49:25.754 --> 49:27.255
not the exam questions.

49:27.923 --> 49:30.467
2022 FIRST SEMESTER
MIDTERM EXAMS ANSWER SHEET ORIGINAL COPY

49:34.012 --> 49:36.473
-All teaching staff. Please come here.
-Put them in.

49:36.556 --> 49:38.892
<i>The police found a hand-written list</i>

49:38.975 --> 49:42.270
<i>of Descartes members
from the director's desk drawer</i>

49:42.354 --> 49:44.898
<i>and found the 21 students
currently standing trial.</i>

49:47.317 --> 49:49.486
<i>And digital forensics found the answers</i>

49:49.569 --> 49:52.197
<i>for both multiple-choice
and short-answer questions</i>

49:52.280 --> 49:56.868
<i>that students had saved on
their phones and laptops before the exams.</i>

49:57.619 --> 50:01.415
How are we going to find
the three hiding students?

50:01.498 --> 50:04.292
What the 21 students have in common
as discovered by the police…

50:04.376 --> 50:05.752
We need to start from there.

50:06.837 --> 50:12.300
First, those three students
are no longer in Descartes presently.

50:12.968 --> 50:17.222
Second, they're top-ranked students.

50:17.973 --> 50:22.227
Third, their parents are assemblymen,
ministers, university hospital doctors,

50:22.310 --> 50:25.272
celebrities, or judicial officers.

50:25.355 --> 50:29.609
The kids got the exam papers
not because their grades were poor.

50:29.693 --> 50:34.072
They got them because it gave them
time to focus on other things.

50:34.156 --> 50:37.367
We need to find those
who made extracurricular achievements

50:37.451 --> 50:39.244
before and after the exams,

50:39.327 --> 50:42.414
such as competition awards,
research papers, or Model UN conferences.

50:43.457 --> 50:44.958
So that's why…

50:46.084 --> 50:48.378
<i>Presiding Judge Kang's son
had a big accident.</i>

50:48.462 --> 50:50.505
<i>The news really shocked me, too.</i>

50:50.589 --> 50:52.758
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

50:57.554 --> 50:58.555
Well…

51:00.432 --> 51:02.434
What brings you here?

51:03.310 --> 51:05.812
We heard that your eldest son
was in an accident.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.230
It's late, but…

51:10.692 --> 51:15.071
We'll see each other at work tomorrow.
You didn't have to come all this way.

51:15.155 --> 51:16.656
We also had something to tell you.

51:17.699 --> 51:19.868
We should have reported it right away,

51:19.951 --> 51:22.454
but we needed to look into it first.

51:27.876 --> 51:30.170
It's about the Moonkwang High School
Exam Paper Leak Case.

51:31.713 --> 51:35.759
We've been tipped off that the prosecution
has missed a few students.

51:38.637 --> 51:39.638
What?

51:41.473 --> 51:43.517
We narrowed them down to eight.

51:44.601 --> 51:47.270
What are the commonalities
that we've missed?

51:48.897 --> 51:52.108
It's definitely one of them.

51:54.569 --> 51:55.445
<i>Who?</i>

51:55.987 --> 51:57.197
Who said such nonsense?

51:57.280 --> 52:00.033
One of the boys
from the protection cases testified so.

52:00.116 --> 52:03.495
Lee Seok-hyeon? Did you know
he was put on probation for fraud?

52:03.578 --> 52:06.832
Yes. As far as I know,
his probation has already ended.

52:06.915 --> 52:08.458
That's the problem with you.

52:09.334 --> 52:12.087
You don't help young offenders
grow up to be upright people.

52:12.170 --> 52:14.464
You just complicate things every time.

52:17.175 --> 52:20.971
Our job is to judge, not to investigate
what the prosecution might have missed.

52:21.596 --> 52:24.516
The court doesn't have the authority
to investigate or prosecute.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.769
Stop crossing the line

52:28.979 --> 52:30.272
and leave.

52:33.441 --> 52:34.442
Honey.

52:36.570 --> 52:37.404
Who…

52:37.487 --> 52:39.114
But what if there are students

52:40.448 --> 52:43.159
the prosecution missed
as Lee Seok-hyeon stated?

52:43.910 --> 52:44.995
What?

52:45.078 --> 52:46.663
What if there are students

52:49.082 --> 52:51.877
who dropped out of Descartes
before investigations began?

52:55.922 --> 52:58.592
You are talking nonsense.

53:02.262 --> 53:03.346
For example…

53:05.307 --> 53:07.726
Moonkwang High School, Grade 12, Class 1…

53:10.937 --> 53:12.355
Kang Sin-u.

53:23.074 --> 53:25.368
<i>If you were to select
the members for Descartes,</i>

53:25.452 --> 53:27.120
what would your criteria be?

53:29.164 --> 53:30.040
Sorry?

53:31.666 --> 53:34.461
If it was me, I'd look far ahead.

53:35.378 --> 53:37.047
I'd want to increase
the admission rate for the school.

53:38.006 --> 53:40.967
I'll pick someone who can
make it into SNU even if they fail

53:42.385 --> 53:44.137
and have to resit the exam.

53:45.597 --> 53:48.475
A child who gets good grades

53:49.935 --> 53:51.811
both in school and in mock exams.

53:57.609 --> 53:58.944
SCHOOL GRADES, RANK 1
MOCK EXAMS, RANK 3

53:59.027 --> 54:01.655
The teaching director
is keeping his mouth sealed

54:01.738 --> 54:04.032
because the students' parents
are not just wealthy.

54:04.115 --> 54:07.118
What if they're people of high social rank

54:07.202 --> 54:09.287
he can't bring up
or can get favors from later?

54:10.038 --> 54:11.039
If that's the reason…

54:11.623 --> 54:12.874
Wait a minute. Then…

54:12.958 --> 54:16.002
GRADE 12 CLASS 1 KANG SIN-U

54:18.755 --> 54:19.673
Wait.

54:19.756 --> 54:22.300
STUDENT RECORD
GRADE 12 CLASS 1 KANG SIN-U

54:25.136 --> 54:27.639
-<i>They lacked relation to the case.
-If you won't summon them,</i>

54:27.722 --> 54:29.849
<i>you shouldn't take any witnesses
put forward by the defense as well.</i>

54:29.933 --> 54:34.062
Are you suggesting
that my witness selection is biased?

54:38.775 --> 54:40.193
Why didn't I see it before?

54:40.276 --> 54:42.612
What's wrong? Have you found something?

54:44.698 --> 54:47.701
KANG SIN-U

55:06.594 --> 55:07.637
Why don't you just…

55:10.306 --> 55:11.599
turn yourself in, Presiding Judge Kang?

55:15.437 --> 55:16.438
No.

55:19.274 --> 55:20.692
Kang Sin-u's father.

56:40.688 --> 56:44.150
THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS
