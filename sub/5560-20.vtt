I need new passports. I need to secure

00:31.109 --> 00:33.610
a safe passage into another country.

00:33.673 --> 00:35.008
- I need...
- Money...

00:35.076 --> 00:38.116
you came back to me because you need money.

00:38.151 --> 00:40.210
I love you, Bethany.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.311
But I had to run, and if you were smart,

00:42.376 --> 00:44.170
you would do the same.

00:44.246 --> 00:45.692
I don't run.

01:14.917 --> 01:17.576
Thanks for meeting me up here.

01:17.637 --> 01:19.832
What is this place?

01:19.932 --> 01:22.871
The woman upstairs is a
retired record producer.

01:22.943 --> 01:25.622
She puts up some of the old jazz
musicians who come through town.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.817
Turns into a bit of a jam session.

01:27.852 --> 01:29.815
Real hard to get tickets.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.289
(distant jazz music playing)

01:31.344 --> 01:33.698
This song, uh...

01:33.733 --> 01:36.367
I know it from somewhere.

01:36.479 --> 01:39.647
You were never really into
jazz until we got together.

01:41.326 --> 01:43.627
My mother died when I was a kid

01:43.687 --> 01:47.098
and her albums are all I really
had of her growing up, so...

01:47.176 --> 01:48.477
I'd listen to them over and over

01:48.551 --> 01:51.668
and they just... they became a part of me.

01:51.735 --> 01:54.203
Music was important to me, so...

01:54.316 --> 01:56.216
it became important to you.

01:57.915 --> 02:00.583
You said you wanted me to open up more,

02:00.719 --> 02:02.787
tell you about our past.

02:02.912 --> 02:04.995
What?

02:05.125 --> 02:08.413
It's just...

02:08.460 --> 02:11.416
How do I know you're telling me the truth?

02:11.510 --> 02:13.187
It's the truth.

02:16.293 --> 02:18.348
Then I need to meet the others.

02:18.457 --> 02:21.562
If we're all part of this
organization, there are more of us.

02:21.636 --> 02:23.503
I want to talk to them.

02:27.082 --> 02:28.783
For you.

02:28.928 --> 02:30.552
Another mission.

02:31.982 --> 02:33.812
Stick it into any FBI computer.

02:33.869 --> 02:35.306
It'll do the rest.

02:36.669 --> 02:38.646
What will it do?

02:38.842 --> 02:40.815
Copy some files we need.

02:42.367 --> 02:43.818
I don't know about this.

02:43.853 --> 02:45.365
It'll be undetectable.

02:45.473 --> 02:46.939
We just need to get behind the firewall.

02:47.021 --> 02:49.405
When the light turns from
red to green, it's done.

02:52.044 --> 02:55.843
I know it's hard for you to trust me.

02:55.955 --> 02:59.401
But there was a time when you
trusted me more than anyone.

03:01.606 --> 03:03.871
I promise we'll get back there.

03:07.004 --> 03:08.331
I should go.

03:10.087 --> 03:12.322
Yeah. Yeah.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.121

03:46.170 --> 03:47.203

Uno Attack? (chuckles)

03:49.071 --> 03:50.362

Yeah.

03:51.738 --> 03:54.869
Sawyer is the reigning champ in our house.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.620
Must be killing you not to
be the best at something.

03:57.722 --> 03:59.110
Don't you worry.

03:59.209 --> 04:01.569
I'm gonna knock that kid
off his throne tonight.

04:02.379 --> 04:04.515
I'm subbing in for my dad.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.434
How is he?

04:07.899 --> 04:10.631
He's not great, really.

04:10.682 --> 04:13.981
The doctors think that
he doesn't have much time.

04:14.774 --> 04:16.358
I'm sorry.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.406
He's fighting a good fight, though.

04:19.567 --> 04:23.690
He's determined. Stubborn as hell.

04:23.952 --> 04:25.668
Always has been.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.761
Sounds a little like someone I know.

04:30.793 --> 04:33.104
You're welcome to join tonight.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.172
Sawyer's picking dinner,

04:35.233 --> 04:41.015
so it's either gonna be pizza
or hot dogs with hush puppies.

04:41.117 --> 04:45.239
That sounds like fun. I'll think about it.

04:45.336 --> 04:46.602
Okay.

04:51.274 --> 04:52.708
(door closes)

04:54.499 --> 04:55.940
You asked for a psych consultant.

04:55.975 --> 04:58.202
Oh, yeah, a young patient
came in this morning.

04:58.249 --> 05:01.639
She was found wandering the streets
of Chelsea, covered in blood.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.491
There's been no missing
person's reports yet.

05:04.592 --> 05:06.415
- What has she told you?
- Well, that's the problem.

05:06.482 --> 05:08.310
There doesn't seem to be
anything medically wrong with her,

05:08.382 --> 05:11.163
but she's not speaking.

05:14.627 --> 05:17.599
Hello. I'm Robert.

05:19.242 --> 05:20.737
What's your name?

05:23.202 --> 05:25.301
Do you know where your family is?

05:27.255 --> 05:28.943
What's the extent of her injuries?

05:29.018 --> 05:30.883
She had some pretty deep cuts,

05:30.961 --> 05:33.769
possibly from metal or glass.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.378
We've given her a tetanus
shot as a precaution.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.766
(Borden) This picture, what does it mean?

05:45.831 --> 05:47.460
Do you recognize it?

05:48.131 --> 05:49.913
I've seen it before.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.496
(Patterson) This sketch is an exact
match with one of Jane's tattoos.

05:53.531 --> 05:56.155
It's the crest for the
Ahmadi family of Syria.

05:56.235 --> 05:58.638
The Ahmadis run a highly secretive,

05:58.747 --> 06:01.058
highly organized terrorist organization.

06:01.144 --> 06:04.921
They're responsible for deadly
attacks in Syria, Yemen, and Egypt.

06:04.984 --> 06:06.800
(Mayfair) This makes
sense. We received intel

06:06.878 --> 06:08.781
the three members of Ahmadi family

06:08.851 --> 06:10.786
entered the U.S. on false papers.

06:10.831 --> 06:14.026
The potential for a terror attack
has Homeland Security on alert.

06:14.089 --> 06:15.232
What <i>do</i> we know about them?

06:15.293 --> 06:17.110
The leader is Tarek Ahmadi.

06:17.173 --> 06:19.387
He's number five on the
FBI's most wanted list.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.389
The SEALS staged a raid on an Ahmadi
family compound six months ago.

06:22.429 --> 06:24.238
They killed Tarek's brother, Zahid.

06:24.307 --> 06:26.594
But the organization still
largely remains a mystery.

06:26.672 --> 06:29.064
How could the little girl have
seen this family crest before?

06:29.127 --> 06:32.455
She must have had some kind
of interaction with the Ahmadis

06:32.494 --> 06:35.238
or at least been exposed to that symbol.

06:35.316 --> 06:36.459
She's just a kid.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.576
So they could be planning
some grassroots terror attack.

06:38.638 --> 06:40.062
What about the notebook?

06:40.136 --> 06:42.553
Her drawings are extraordinarily detailed.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.107
If she's sketching the crest,

06:44.180 --> 06:46.841
perhaps there's other
valuable intel in there.

06:46.876 --> 06:48.411
Well, I explained to Patterson earlier

06:48.446 --> 06:50.645
that the girl has a very
severe form of autism.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.739
So taking away the one
familiar object she has

06:52.797 --> 06:54.860
would be harmful at this stage.

06:55.845 --> 06:58.759
I will get the notebook, but
it needs to be on her terms.

06:58.845 --> 07:00.587
We need to talk to this little girl.

07:00.658 --> 07:02.625
We need to find out where she's from...

07:02.700 --> 07:05.049
more importantly, how she's
connected to the Ahmadis.

07:05.112 --> 07:06.148
(Mayfair) This girl could be the key

07:06.218 --> 07:09.075
to stopping an imminent
terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

07:09.140 --> 07:11.553
We need to get through to
her and we need to do it now.

07:11.595 --> 07:14.084
Unfortunately, that's not gonna be so easy.

07:16.975 --> 07:20.405
Can you tell me, do you
have any brothers or sisters?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.850

We just got avuncular DNA results back.

They confirm the little girl

08:31.631 --> 08:33.299
If that's the case, her name is Maya.

08:33.356 --> 08:35.075
Ahmadi only has one daughter her age.

- Yes, Nermin Ahmadi, Tarek's fifth wife.

08:38.332 --> 08:39.479
Her whereabouts are unknown.

Just the maternal grandmother

08:44.526 --> 08:46.090
Well, it makes sense
she'd understand English.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.731
The daughter of Tarek Ahmadi
would have had the best tutors.

08:48.827 --> 08:51.195
Three Ahmadi men recently
entered the U.S....

08:51.257 --> 08:53.378
Amar, Riham, and Asil.

08:53.413 --> 08:55.902
Nermin and Maya must have slipped
through our borders with them.

08:55.937 --> 08:57.692
But why bring a child?

08:57.812 --> 08:58.702
I don't know.

08:58.756 --> 09:01.791
But this many Ahmadis in the U.S.
is a very disturbing development.

09:01.854 --> 09:04.245
They wouldn't take that risk
unless an attack was coming.

09:04.309 --> 09:06.975
We need to find out where Maya
was before she was discovered.

09:07.038 --> 09:08.860
It could be where the clan was hiding.

09:08.946 --> 09:12.989
Finding that might be the only way
to stop this attack before it happens.

Doc, can you think of any
way to break through to her?

09:15.994 --> 09:19.315

traditional methods of therapy.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.157
But I might have an idea.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.850
That's all right. You can touch 'em.

09:32.779 --> 09:35.797
Some of these look like
the pictures you draw.

09:37.193 --> 09:39.170
I was lost once, too.

09:40.530 --> 09:42.875

But we... we need to take a
look at <i>your</i> sketchbook.

10:55.043 --> 10:57.071
(Borden) Would you let us borrow it?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.953
Just for a little while.

11:08.597 --> 11:09.983
Thank you.

11:15.779 --> 11:17.870
My team's been analyzing Maya's sketches.

11:17.948 --> 11:19.811
She obviously has a photographic memory.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.625
All right, so what did you find?

11:21.702 --> 11:24.439
We think her pictures must
contain clues to where she's been.

11:24.501 --> 11:27.888
We've been trying to identify
any markers or hidden messages.

11:27.927 --> 11:29.120
(Mayfair) Go through every drawing.

11:29.198 --> 11:32.725
Somewhere in that book there must be
a clue to the Ahmadis' attack plan.

11:32.777 --> 11:33.648
(Zapata) We've got something.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.803
The portraits in the
sketchbook were so detailed,

11:35.840 --> 11:37.833
we were able to run
them through facial rec.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.481
Got a hit... Jeremy Rance,

11:39.552 --> 11:41.156
an American journalist
who lives in Brooklyn.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.572
He wrote a "Vanity Fair"
article last year on Cabrera,

11:43.635 --> 11:45.125
the leader of Venezuela's Costeno cartel.

11:45.203 --> 11:47.415
I remember, he was
brought in for questioning

11:47.504 --> 11:50.895
after having several meetings
with Cabrera on U.S. soil.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.985
Landed up on all the watch lists.

11:53.053 --> 11:54.647
Rance has a rock-star following.

11:54.702 --> 11:56.712
He was on the cover of
"Men's Health," "Esquire."

11:56.775 --> 11:58.079
He gave a TED talk.

11:58.114 --> 12:00.070
Some fun facts... he's
a former amateur boxer

12:00.149 --> 12:01.960
and a self-proclaimed adrenaline junkie.

12:02.061 --> 12:03.916
- Sounds like a jackass.
- (Reade) Pretty much.

12:03.986 --> 12:08.477
If Maya sketched his face, she must
have met him or at least seen him.

12:08.587 --> 12:11.006
Maybe Rance was interviewing
members of her family.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.617
He was suspected of helping
Cabrera come into the U.S.

12:13.687 --> 12:14.726
He could have helped the little girl

12:14.805 --> 12:17.706
and other Ahmadi family
members come stateside, too.

12:17.741 --> 12:19.942
If that's the case, he'd know where she was

12:19.977 --> 12:21.481
and where her family's hiding.

12:21.516 --> 12:23.972
(Zapata) And he might know
something about the upcoming attack.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.315
Bring him in.

12:25.365 --> 12:27.565

It's on 47th and 9th.

13:36.933 --> 13:39.157
We don't know how long we
have before these guys strike.

13:39.217 --> 13:40.349
Let's go.

13:54.696 --> 13:56.045
It's a perfect replica

13:56.080 --> 13:57.807
down to every last brick on the buildings.

13:57.892 --> 13:59.622
Except it doesn't
pinpoint an exact address.

13:59.685 --> 14:01.680
It could be any one of these buildings.

14:01.851 --> 14:04.218
All right, well, let's start asking around.

14:06.206 --> 14:07.604
(Weller) Broken glass...

14:07.639 --> 14:08.888
from that window.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.381
And the barbed wire up there.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.955
Maya had cuts all over her arms and legs.

14:13.029 --> 14:15.322
This could be where the
Ahmadi cell is camped out.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.015
(Weller, low voice) Watch it, watch it.

14:21.101 --> 14:23.344
Play outside, play outside, play outside.

14:23.452 --> 14:24.827
- (Jane) Go outside.
- Get outside.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.123
(Jane) It's okay.

14:27.474 --> 14:30.509
♪♪

14:38.740 --> 14:40.235
- Clear.
- Clear!

14:40.312 --> 14:41.445
Clear.

14:43.635 --> 14:44.911
In here!

14:44.989 --> 14:57.214
♪♪

15:11.075 --> 15:13.161
This looks to be Nermin Ahmadi,

15:13.270 --> 15:14.655
Maya's mother.

15:14.718 --> 15:18.588
She matches a surveillance photo
the State Department has on file.

15:18.652 --> 15:22.026
I just hope Maya didn't see
anything before she escaped.

15:23.898 --> 15:25.767
(Weller) I talked to the landlord.

15:25.853 --> 15:27.597
Nermin and Maya arrived yesterday.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.270
Paid the first month's rent
in cash. Used a fake name.

15:30.365 --> 15:32.437
They didn't bring much with them...
just some clothing, a stuffed animal,

15:32.508 --> 15:33.852
and some sketchbooks for Maya.

15:33.916 --> 15:35.715
So where are the other Ahmadi members?

15:35.781 --> 15:37.441
They cut out her tongue.

15:37.510 --> 15:40.710
I just talked to the M.E. She died from
blood loss and it didn't happen quickly.

15:40.772 --> 15:44.388
(Reade) Nermin must have information
about the Ahmadis' attack plan.

15:44.466 --> 15:46.928
They found out she was talking
to an American reporter.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.322
Silenced her once and for all.

15:48.393 --> 15:50.661
(Jane) If Nermin knew the
plan, Maya could have, too.

15:50.791 --> 15:52.825
She could be the next target.

15:56.624 --> 15:58.449
How do you know Nermin Ahmadi?

15:58.484 --> 16:00.236
It's getting repetitive at this point,

16:00.271 --> 16:02.978
but I will... say it again.

16:03.068 --> 16:04.852
I can't reveal my sources.

16:04.887 --> 16:07.465
Well, she's not much of a source
to you anymore. She's dead.

16:07.543 --> 16:09.328
Her body was found in a
Hell's Kitchen apartment

16:09.399 --> 16:11.079
this morning, tortured to death.

16:11.114 --> 16:15.574
So, again, how do you know
Nermin and why was she here?

16:15.629 --> 16:17.514
Did you help her get into the country?

16:17.549 --> 16:20.470
We believe the Ahmadis are
here to plan a domestic attack.

16:20.505 --> 16:23.241
What did Nermin tell
you about their target?

16:26.439 --> 16:30.475
There is a little girl
sitting in a room all alone,

16:30.540 --> 16:34.209
no idea that her mother has
just been tortured to death.

16:34.423 --> 16:36.764
It was slow. Painful.

16:36.820 --> 16:38.660
This little girl could be next.

16:38.695 --> 16:40.531
This isn't about a news piece.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.167
This is about an innocent child.

16:43.319 --> 16:45.709
Maya has no one in the world.

16:45.826 --> 16:47.422
If you want to make this right,

16:47.457 --> 16:49.701
start talking now.

16:54.540 --> 16:59.493
I met Nermin... in Syria six months ago.

16:59.571 --> 17:02.494
She'd been shunned by the family
because of Maya's disability.

17:02.615 --> 17:05.885
Nermin wanted out, so I offered
her safe passage to the U.S.

17:05.946 --> 17:07.476
in exchange for an interview.

17:07.511 --> 17:09.262
When did she arrive?

17:09.468 --> 17:10.371
Yesterday.

17:10.406 --> 17:13.991
And did she say anything about any more
of the Ahmadis coming to the States?

17:14.053 --> 17:17.025
Do you know anything about
an attack on U.S. soil?

17:17.095 --> 17:20.741
We were supposed to meet...
again tonight to talk.

17:20.809 --> 17:24.856
I... I never thought that
they would follow her here.

17:24.907 --> 17:28.520
If they killed Nermin because
she was talking to you,

17:28.577 --> 17:30.843
you do realize you're the next target.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.891
They want to know
everything that she told you.

17:34.308 --> 17:36.610
Then use me.

17:36.927 --> 17:38.937
You said that they're gonna want
to find out what Nermin told me,

17:39.034 --> 17:40.780
so use me as bait.

17:42.455 --> 17:44.287
Let's draw them out.

17:58.312 --> 18:00.313
(grunting throughout)

18:18.172 --> 18:19.428
(groans)

18:19.551 --> 18:21.614
The prints found in
Nermin's apartment match

18:21.649 --> 18:23.598
one of the Ahmadi soldiers you took down.

18:23.633 --> 18:25.384
You got Nermin's killer.

18:25.419 --> 18:28.238
And it appears we got all
three of the Ahmadis' guys

18:28.300 --> 18:30.369
the CIA has been tracking in the U.S.

18:30.455 --> 18:31.921
Any word on Maya's grandmother?

18:32.007 --> 18:34.755
Yes, we were able to locate her
in a refugee camp in Germany.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.406
We'll get her stateside as soon as we can.

18:36.511 --> 18:38.160
(Mayfair) Maya could still be in danger.

18:38.222 --> 18:40.343
If the Ahmadis think she
helped stop an attack,

18:40.401 --> 18:43.269
someone will eventually
make a play for her.

18:43.568 --> 18:46.027
(Weller) If they found her
once, they can find her again.

18:46.121 --> 18:47.841
(Mayfair) We need to
relocate and debrief her,

18:47.919 --> 18:51.754
find out if the Ahmadis have more
operatives planning attacks in the States.

18:51.809 --> 18:54.135
(Franklin) I'll arrange for a safe
house. She'll be taken care of.

18:54.182 --> 18:55.597
Maya finds comfort in familiarity.

18:55.683 --> 18:57.871
She's do much better with
people she's been around.

18:57.959 --> 19:00.073
What do you suggest, then?

19:00.201 --> 19:03.091
Well, it's a little unorthodox, but...

19:03.196 --> 19:05.922
I have a small house in the country
that my aunt recently left me.

19:05.957 --> 19:08.500
In a serene, friendly
environment, she might open up.

19:08.535 --> 19:10.970
It'll allow us to debrief her
before she goes into hiding.

19:11.005 --> 19:12.650
I don't think that's wise.

19:12.712 --> 19:15.561
Shipping her off to some safe house
is going to be so jarring for her.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.902
Maya isn't just a little
girl. She's the daughter

19:17.981 --> 19:20.344
of one of the most dangerous
terrorists in the world.

19:20.399 --> 19:22.732
(Mayfair) Dr. Borden's been
making progress with her.

19:22.805 --> 19:26.936
If she shuts down now, we'll lose our
chance at extremely valuable intel.

19:27.010 --> 19:29.430
Oh, I'm not suggesting
that I take her on my own.

19:29.493 --> 19:30.561
I'll go.

19:30.639 --> 19:31.878
Why do you want to go?

19:31.940 --> 19:33.706
I can... I...

19:33.795 --> 19:36.129
I like cottages.

19:38.555 --> 19:40.909
I just... I want to help Maya.

19:41.660 --> 19:43.628
We'll all go.

19:43.710 --> 19:46.231
She'll have full FBI protection.

19:46.300 --> 19:49.273
And hopefully, an easy
transition if we're all there.

19:49.366 --> 19:51.782
Maya has opened up to our team.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.015
This girl could hold the key

19:53.093 --> 19:56.360
to taking down one of the
most dangerous terror groups

19:56.410 --> 19:59.936
if she's with people she trusts.

20:01.836 --> 20:03.061
All right.

20:03.144 --> 20:06.722
As soon as her grandmother lands, I will
arrange for her transfer to Virginia.

20:06.796 --> 20:09.540
Until then, she's in your custody.

20:10.435 --> 20:11.685
(Weller) Wow.

20:12.804 --> 20:15.630
I haven't been out here since I was a kid.

20:15.754 --> 20:19.328
My dad used to take us camping
on the Pennsylvania border.

20:20.006 --> 20:21.942
You came with us a couple of times.

20:22.038 --> 20:25.173
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

20:25.271 --> 20:26.833
I remember... (chuckles)

20:26.918 --> 20:30.199
I remember this one time,
it started pouring rain.

20:30.265 --> 20:33.167
My dad got us these
cheap rubber rain boots.

20:33.284 --> 20:36.728
Yours... pink, purple,
flowers all over them.

20:36.946 --> 20:39.384
You loved those damn things so much,

20:39.445 --> 20:42.547
you wouldn't take 'em off
even when you went to bed.

20:43.068 --> 20:44.332
Hmm.

20:45.469 --> 20:47.437
(Weller chuckles)

20:47.604 --> 20:50.333
I know he had his flaws, but...

20:50.442 --> 20:52.957
it seems like your dad did try...

20:54.212 --> 20:56.690
until everything happened.

20:57.226 --> 20:59.295
Used to be my hero.

21:00.622 --> 21:02.546
I wanted to be just like him.

21:03.088 --> 21:05.055
Have a big yard.

21:06.095 --> 21:07.907
Lots of my own kids.

21:09.262 --> 21:11.740
Can't imagine a life like that now.

21:12.561 --> 21:14.700
- Why not?
- Come on.

21:14.735 --> 21:16.710
Raising kids?

21:16.797 --> 21:19.431
What we do? (chuckles)

21:19.853 --> 21:23.311
I don't think I could be the
kind of dad I'd like to be.

21:25.789 --> 21:27.975
I think you'd make a great dad.

21:29.819 --> 21:31.867
For what it's worth.

21:33.198 --> 21:34.767
Thank you.

21:35.108 --> 21:36.492
Hmm.

21:37.332 --> 21:39.699
Do you think Maya's gonna be okay?

21:39.734 --> 21:41.796
Yeah.

21:41.899 --> 21:43.449
She'll be fine.

21:43.579 --> 21:45.414
(changing radio stations)

21:45.525 --> 21:47.459
(country music)

21:47.630 --> 21:51.818
(woman) <i>♪ We'll face
this world together... ♪</i>

21:51.923 --> 21:53.610
Country.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.448
Interesting choice.

21:56.488 --> 21:59.101
I'm more of a One Direction man myself.

21:59.153 --> 22:02.154
(country music continues)

22:07.682 --> 22:09.233
We found the girl.

22:33.366 --> 22:35.927
So... this hall wraps
around to the restroom

22:35.998 --> 22:37.335
and the two back bedrooms.

22:37.370 --> 22:39.158
And the heating should kick in soon,

22:39.212 --> 22:42.410
so just make yourselves at home.

22:44.141 --> 22:45.410
Does the fireplace work?

22:45.467 --> 22:48.482
It should be all good. The
gas switch is on the side.

22:49.307 --> 22:51.442
(switch clicks, gas ignites)

22:51.524 --> 22:53.190
There you go.

22:59.558 --> 23:02.422
I guess we're going on the tour.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.481
Sorry about all the construction mess.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.884
(chuckles)

23:07.067 --> 23:09.034
It really is a never-ending process.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.044
I fix the plumbing and
then the heating goes out.

23:11.087 --> 23:13.723
I repair the roof and then the oven breaks.

23:13.835 --> 23:16.482
In the beginning, it was like a
real-life version of the Oregon Trail

23:16.579 --> 23:18.762
with only slightly less dysentery.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.904
Do you... do you know that game?

23:21.982 --> 23:23.091
(laughs) Yeah.

23:23.126 --> 23:27.104
Uh, I... I can't believe
that you know that game.

23:27.651 --> 23:30.083
Or that you like One Direction.

23:30.161 --> 23:31.054
That was a joke.

23:31.117 --> 23:33.791
Oh, oh, okay. Was it?

23:33.966 --> 23:35.366
(chuckling)

23:37.307 --> 23:39.008
Tasha, you got a sec?

23:39.043 --> 23:40.376
Yeah, what's up?

23:40.798 --> 23:43.169
I wasn't snooping, but I noticed you
were looking through Tom Carter's files.

23:43.249 --> 23:45.483
What are you digging around for?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.790
I'm not digging around for anything.

23:48.207 --> 23:49.856
You need to drop it.

23:49.925 --> 23:51.325
What are you talking about?

23:51.415 --> 23:53.468
Trust me, no good can come from it.

23:54.823 --> 23:57.315
You looked into Tom
Carter, too, didn't you?

23:57.752 --> 24:00.427
- What'd you find?
- That's beside the point.

24:00.528 --> 24:02.074
How come every time you ask me a question,

24:02.109 --> 24:03.873
I'm supposed to tell you everything?

24:03.939 --> 24:06.359
When I ask you something, you ice me out.

24:06.475 --> 24:08.118
First with Mayfair and now with Carter.

24:08.189 --> 24:10.500
- It's complicated.
- That's exactly what I'm talking about...

24:10.535 --> 24:11.937
your non-answer for everything.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.454
"It's complicated."

24:13.548 --> 24:14.907
(Mayfair) There you are.

24:14.993 --> 24:16.716
The Arabic translator's here.

24:16.775 --> 24:20.477
We've got Maya grandmother
on the line from Germany.

24:25.104 --> 24:26.438
Any luck?

24:26.583 --> 24:29.184
No, she won't even take a bite.

24:29.438 --> 24:32.134
(sighs) Come on, Maya.

24:32.415 --> 24:33.907
You got to be hungry.

24:34.009 --> 24:36.709
Maybe... she just
doesn't like your cooking.

24:36.749 --> 24:38.216
That's impossible.

24:38.291 --> 24:43.238
- Everyone loves my cooking.
- Let's try something basic.

24:43.394 --> 24:46.136
Maya, do you like bananas?

24:48.700 --> 24:50.347
That's a definite no.

24:50.434 --> 24:53.018
Okay, considering that we've touched upon

24:53.107 --> 24:55.575
every food group known to man...

24:55.723 --> 24:59.024
except the most essential.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.572
Chocolate.

25:10.422 --> 25:11.802
(Patterson) Makes sense.

25:11.852 --> 25:13.753
Chocolate is universally adored.

25:13.788 --> 25:15.521
Well, it's progress.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.460
But we can't just feed
her chocolate all weekend.

25:17.564 --> 25:20.531
I mean... I do that sometimes.

25:20.589 --> 25:23.731
Well, maybe we need to try cooking
some more Middle Eastern foods.

25:23.793 --> 25:25.697
You know, things that she's familiar with.

25:25.783 --> 25:28.339
Okay. How far is the store?

25:28.521 --> 25:30.852
About half an hour down the road.

25:33.063 --> 25:34.143
Let's go.

25:34.284 --> 25:37.949
Tell Rasha her granddaughter is safe.

25:38.091 --> 25:40.493
- (speaking Arabic)
- <i>(Rasha speaking Arabic)</i>

25:40.587 --> 25:42.425
She says, "Thank God."

25:42.480 --> 25:44.522
What about her daughter?

25:44.602 --> 25:47.686
Unfortunately, her daughter was killed.

25:47.758 --> 25:51.299
We are so sorry to give her this bad news.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.421
(translator speaking Arabic)

25:53.470 --> 25:57.323
(Rasha speaking Arabic)

25:57.433 --> 26:00.814
She says she was killed
because of her drawings.

26:00.939 --> 26:02.594
I think there was a misunderstanding.

26:02.703 --> 26:03.588
Can you try to explain to her

26:03.623 --> 26:06.347
that it was Nermin that
was killed and Maya's safe?

26:06.426 --> 26:10.039
(translator speaking Arabic)

26:10.172 --> 26:13.580
(Rasha speaking Arabic)

26:13.696 --> 26:15.301
She says that she understands,

26:15.364 --> 26:17.214
but she was killed because of her drawings.

26:17.291 --> 26:20.921
She thinks Nermin was killed
because of Maya's drawings.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.194
- Why?
- (speaking Arabic)

26:23.319 --> 26:27.576
- (Rasha speaking Arabic)
- Her drawings...

26:27.634 --> 26:30.305
they can identify all the Ahmadis.

26:31.448 --> 26:34.266
Which means we can finally put a face
to the names and take some of them down.

26:34.352 --> 26:37.074
Maya's still a target.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.310
(sighs)

26:39.502 --> 26:41.636
Hey, how's Allie?

26:41.729 --> 26:43.921
Uh... (chuckles)

26:43.997 --> 26:46.916
Allie and I, uh...

26:47.044 --> 26:49.470
We're not together anymore.

26:49.618 --> 26:52.690
Oh. Had no idea.

26:52.895 --> 26:54.277
What happened?

26:54.386 --> 26:57.076
She was reading into things.

26:57.177 --> 26:59.779
She thought you and I...

26:59.977 --> 27:02.293
So... yeah.

27:02.353 --> 27:05.343
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

27:05.453 --> 27:08.758
We both kept falling back into bad habits.

27:08.813 --> 27:10.842
(laughing)

27:10.918 --> 27:13.487
(computer voice) You have an incoming call.

27:13.628 --> 27:15.535
Reade. What's up?

27:15.656 --> 27:16.838
You guys up at the cabin?

27:16.932 --> 27:19.297
<i>No. About half an hour away.</i>

27:19.375 --> 27:20.618
Maya is the target.

27:20.653 --> 27:23.254
Mayfair wants us to put Maya
in a safe house right away.

27:23.366 --> 27:24.265
We'll bring her back.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.647
We tried calling Borden's
cabin, but the landline is down

27:26.682 --> 27:28.359
and neither of their cells have service.

27:28.394 --> 27:29.663
We're on our way up to you guys, too.

27:29.725 --> 27:31.028
<i>Keep trying their cells.</i>

27:31.164 --> 27:32.664
We're heading back there now.

27:33.565 --> 27:36.567
(tires screeching)

27:51.555 --> 27:53.647
(woman on radio) Now here's
Jack with the weather...

27:57.800 --> 27:58.988
She looks happy.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.392
Well, apparently chocolate
in any form is a hit.

28:01.482 --> 28:03.016
She seems to love that cocoa.

28:03.079 --> 28:05.269
I don't think we're gonna
be winning parenting awards.

28:05.367 --> 28:06.852
Well, then we might as well go for broke.

28:06.923 --> 28:09.528
I've got some DVDs in this box over here.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.846
You have kids' movies here?

28:11.932 --> 28:14.161
Does the One Direction
concert documentary count?

28:14.281 --> 28:15.948
(chuckles)

28:18.444 --> 28:20.059
Has the power gone out here before?

28:20.094 --> 28:22.185
Never. All the wiring in the house is new,

28:22.224 --> 28:24.191
including the circuit breakers.

28:26.278 --> 28:27.316
It's dead.

28:27.413 --> 28:29.777
You think this is intentional?

28:29.887 --> 28:31.143
I don't know.

28:31.221 --> 28:32.915
But if someone cut the phone line

28:32.962 --> 28:34.015
and the power, they're close.

28:34.069 --> 28:36.586
The main junction box
is a mile down the road.

28:36.679 --> 28:38.975
Okay, we need to barricade
ourselves in, just in case.

28:39.030 --> 28:40.555
- Do you have a gun?
- No, I don't have anything

28:40.625 --> 28:42.074
that could qualify as a weapon.

28:42.152 --> 28:44.306
Uh, I have my sidearm and a spare clip,

28:44.341 --> 28:45.962
and this is all looking promising.

28:45.997 --> 28:48.302
We could use some of this to kill someone.

28:48.461 --> 28:51.580
All right, I'll take that as a good thing.

29:08.512 --> 29:11.160
Let's move Maya away from the main room.

29:11.195 --> 29:12.400
Maya?

29:14.072 --> 29:15.326
She was just here.

29:15.361 --> 29:17.240
- Maya?
- Maya?

29:18.192 --> 29:20.526
Oh, my God. She's outside.

29:22.875 --> 29:23.768
(tires screeching)

29:23.888 --> 29:25.954
- Do you know that car?
- No.

29:27.462 --> 29:29.046
- Maya, stop!
- Maya!

29:29.110 --> 29:30.944
- Maya!
- Maya, stop!

29:31.214 --> 29:37.017
(gunfire)

29:45.657 --> 29:48.373
Maya, I need you to stay here
for just a few minutes, okay?

29:48.435 --> 29:49.227
- (banging)
- I'm gonna be right outside

29:49.316 --> 29:50.534
and so will Patterson.

29:50.615 --> 29:51.614
(banging)

29:56.099 --> 29:58.467
I'll cover the door. Get back.

29:59.759 --> 30:02.861
(gunfire)

30:16.229 --> 30:18.669
It's okay. It's okay.

30:19.910 --> 30:21.744
I'm gonna grab his weapons.

30:22.192 --> 30:23.327
(panting)

30:23.572 --> 30:25.331
We got to go get Maya, okay?

30:26.435 --> 30:27.969
We got to move.

30:28.511 --> 30:30.420
We got to move. Let's go!

30:32.170 --> 30:34.672
Maya, you did a really good job.

30:34.759 --> 30:36.708
So we're gonna go now, okay?

30:37.177 --> 30:38.368
They're all out front.

30:38.448 --> 30:40.284
We got to go out the back now!

30:42.932 --> 30:44.199
Damn it!

30:44.480 --> 30:46.684
There's more of them. We're surrounded.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.719
(tires screeching)

30:52.972 --> 30:56.141
(gunfire)

31:05.086 --> 31:12.192
(clanking)

31:19.310 --> 31:22.086
It's a distraction. Go! Go!

31:22.121 --> 31:27.725
(gunfire)

31:27.760 --> 31:30.762
Cover me. I'm gonna go to the shed. Go!

31:30.797 --> 31:31.763
(gunfire)

31:31.798 --> 31:33.197
Aah!

31:33.232 --> 31:34.365
(grunting)

31:57.407 --> 31:58.840
(whistling)

32:02.668 --> 32:04.373
Okay, Weller and Jane are here.

32:04.459 --> 32:06.343
- Stay down.
- It's a matter of minutes

32:06.405 --> 32:07.816
until they realize we're up here.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.635
Yeah. We're sitting
ducks. We need to get Maya

32:09.716 --> 32:11.669
on the ground before the
guys follow us up here.

32:11.704 --> 32:15.239
(gunfire)

32:15.480 --> 32:16.652
Go!

32:16.811 --> 32:18.686
Another one is coming inside.
We gotta take her down now.

32:18.763 --> 32:19.929
Okay. What about you?

32:20.012 --> 32:21.813
I'll join you. It's okay. Go.

32:21.848 --> 32:24.088
Maya, please. We have to go now.

32:24.123 --> 32:26.504
They're coming. Maya, you've got to go.

32:26.773 --> 32:29.787
Look, Maya, it's okay.

32:29.822 --> 32:30.888
It's gonna be okay.

32:32.463 --> 32:34.477
We need to get you away from the house.

32:37.031 --> 32:39.689
The back of the house is
clear. They're upstairs.

32:52.949 --> 32:54.473
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

33:04.074 --> 33:05.360
(grunting)

33:05.472 --> 33:06.818
Go! Go, go, go!

33:15.429 --> 33:17.286
- You okay?
- Yeah!

33:31.506 --> 33:32.840
(siren)

33:32.875 --> 33:35.342
(radio transmissions)

33:36.657 --> 33:38.217
Hey, you all right? We
heard about your fall.

33:38.279 --> 33:41.148
It's fine. I just banged
up my ankle a little bit.

33:41.245 --> 33:43.762
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

33:43.844 --> 33:45.283
She's gonna be fine.

33:48.938 --> 33:51.731
I knew this was a terrible
idea. You nearly got her killed.

33:51.815 --> 33:54.048
She's safe, for now.

33:54.155 --> 33:56.702
I'm taking her back with me. The
safe house is all set in Virginia.

33:56.771 --> 33:59.492
You take her away from every face
she knows and she'll shut down.

33:59.574 --> 34:01.322
Or at least let me come with you.

34:01.370 --> 34:03.091
(Franklin) Her grandmother
is on her way. She'll be fine.

34:03.185 --> 34:04.483
(Weller) You're not taking her alone.

34:04.580 --> 34:06.621
One of my team will go with you.

34:06.682 --> 34:08.481
(Jane) She trusts us.

34:16.353 --> 34:19.808
You. You were after Maya all along.

34:19.900 --> 34:20.927
What are you talking about?

34:20.987 --> 34:22.739
She drew your hand.

34:22.775 --> 34:25.485
Maya only draws things
that she's seen before.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.621
You never crossed paths with
her when she was in FBI custody,

34:27.661 --> 34:30.255
so she must have seen you somewhere before.

34:30.371 --> 34:33.091
What does she know about you
that you don't want coming out?

34:34.742 --> 34:35.984
Answer me.

34:36.842 --> 34:37.841
Gun!

34:41.591 --> 34:44.443
(Jane) Put the gun down.
You don't want to do this.

34:44.478 --> 34:47.379
You got no moves. You
shoot him, we'll shoot you.

34:47.456 --> 34:48.928
(Franklin) It's not what you think.

34:49.002 --> 34:51.724
So put the gun down and explain it to me.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.409
(Franklin) I'm going to drive away...

34:54.522 --> 34:55.568
(groaning)

34:55.685 --> 34:57.296
- (gunshot)
- Aah!

34:57.549 --> 35:01.800
(groaning)

35:09.717 --> 35:11.581
(Mayfair) I just got off
the phone with the CIA.

35:11.675 --> 35:14.871
They've been tracking an unknown
source who's been funding the Ahmadis,

35:14.938 --> 35:17.413
hoping they'd rise up
against the Assad government.

35:17.469 --> 35:20.069
- Unfortunately...
- The Ahmadis took those funds

35:20.131 --> 35:21.780
and became an even deadlier organization.

35:21.850 --> 35:23.560
All fingers point to Franklin.

35:23.633 --> 35:29.173
He had access to State Department funds
and to the Ahmadis. It all lines up.

35:29.259 --> 35:32.385
We also IDed the shooters
at Borden's cabin.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.897
They weren't Ahmadi
foot soldiers after all.

35:34.943 --> 35:37.336
Franklin had assembled his own team

35:37.403 --> 35:40.632
to capture Maya and keep his secret safe.

35:40.687 --> 35:43.161
What about Maya? Should we
be concerned about her safety?

35:43.196 --> 35:46.042
Well, now that Franklin's in
custody, she should be in the clear.

35:46.137 --> 35:48.143
No. We can't take any chances.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.114
We have to put the word out that she was
killed in the crossfire at Borden's cabin.

35:51.188 --> 35:56.071
I'm already working with our friends
at the CIA to spread false intel.

35:56.152 --> 36:00.326
The Ahmadis will never have a
reason to come looking for Maya.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.153
(door opening)

36:11.304 --> 36:14.990
Maya. Oh!

36:19.362 --> 36:22.281
Sorry I blew up your house.

36:22.590 --> 36:23.950
It's all right.

36:24.395 --> 36:26.819
Now I've got an excuse
to start from scratch.

36:26.972 --> 36:29.021
I'm pretty good at painting walls...

36:29.175 --> 36:32.892
once you've got walls, that is.

36:33.848 --> 36:36.824
Well, I'll take you up on that.

36:41.792 --> 36:43.694
(phone chiming)

36:44.625 --> 36:46.991
_

36:53.200 --> 36:55.499
_

37:02.072 --> 37:05.077
_

37:09.737 --> 37:12.934
_

37:18.798 --> 37:19.965
Hey.

37:20.987 --> 37:22.274
Yo.

37:22.650 --> 37:25.498
Look, you can keep all the
secrets you want from me,

37:25.533 --> 37:30.049
but I am going to be straight
with you because this affects us.

37:30.190 --> 37:31.492
We both know that there's
something's not right

37:31.555 --> 37:33.544
about Carter's disappearance,
and I think Mayfair

37:33.591 --> 37:35.288
knows something she's not telling us.

37:35.341 --> 37:36.543
Why would you think that?

37:36.598 --> 37:39.670
Too many coincidences... weird connections

37:39.740 --> 37:41.786
between her and stuff that's gone down.

37:41.856 --> 37:44.866
Everybody Mayfair gets
close to winds up dead,

37:44.921 --> 37:46.959
and if you're as smart as you seem,

37:46.994 --> 37:49.519
I know you've had suspicions about her.

37:49.634 --> 37:51.922
Mayfair is the one person
who always has our backs.

37:52.008 --> 37:54.311
I don't know where you're
getting your information from.

37:54.389 --> 37:55.554
Who put a bug in your ear?

37:55.589 --> 37:58.477
No one put a bug in my ear.

37:58.809 --> 38:00.900
I've trusted Mayfair my whole career

38:00.986 --> 38:05.086
and I worked my ass
off to be on her team...

38:05.322 --> 38:06.444
but I'm starting to wonder if maybe

38:06.479 --> 38:09.204
I should've opened my eyes a long time ago.

38:11.726 --> 38:15.587
Okay. What are you gonna do?

38:16.462 --> 38:18.614
I'm gonna get some answers.

38:36.131 --> 38:39.309
If you refuse to cooperate,
they'll kill Agent Weller.

38:51.374 --> 38:54.033
Jane... I was looking for you.

38:54.126 --> 38:56.788
Oh, I was looking for you too.

38:56.827 --> 39:00.363
I was hoping that I could
take you up on game night.

39:00.538 --> 39:03.343
Great. You ready to go?

39:03.445 --> 39:05.434
I just have to grab my coat.

39:05.495 --> 39:06.727
Okay.

39:10.016 --> 39:12.030
Uh, I'll meet you in the lobby?

39:14.590 --> 39:16.555
Nice necklace, by the way.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.296
Oh. (laughing)

39:18.358 --> 39:21.430
Thanks. Someone special gave it to me.

39:53.846 --> 39:55.623
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

39:57.379 --> 40:00.046
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:02.260 --> 40:03.912
You know what this needs?

40:04.014 --> 40:06.572
- Hmm?
- Some ice.

40:06.683 --> 40:08.545
I'll go get some.

40:09.732 --> 40:12.307
Bethany, I know what you're doing.

40:12.393 --> 40:14.274
Getting ice.

40:14.359 --> 40:16.976
We can take this as slow as you want.

40:17.131 --> 40:22.055
I mean, maybe meeting up in
my room wasn't the best call.

40:22.156 --> 40:25.224
I'm fine. I'm more than fine.

40:25.259 --> 40:30.362
It's just... I'll be right back.

40:38.638 --> 40:40.500
All right. Oh!

40:40.539 --> 40:42.425
- Yeah!
- (laughing)

40:42.538 --> 40:44.871
- I told you I would win again.
- Yeah.

40:44.947 --> 40:47.751
You're clearly gonna win again.

40:48.491 --> 40:49.743
It's not fair.

40:49.778 --> 40:51.962
I... I... I should go.

40:52.028 --> 40:53.841
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40:53.914 --> 40:56.863
We're gonna feed those
hungry hippos next. Hmm?

40:56.917 --> 40:58.402
- Next time.
- ‭All right.

40:58.454 --> 41:00.302
All right. I'll see you.

41:00.450 --> 41:01.770
(Sawyer) Bye.

41:45.775 --> 41:49.278
I just thought of a great
place we could go to for dinner.

41:51.756 --> 41:53.324

42:04.183 --> 42:06.398

42:23.985 --> 42:27.600

into Tom Carter's disappearance

42:27.689 --> 42:29.694
or you're next.
