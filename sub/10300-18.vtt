01:17.400 --> 01:20.392
- Is nothing I do good enough for you?
- I am not talking to you.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.909
I don't wanna discuss this anymore.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.954
Al, it's our 20th anniversary,
and you give me a postcard.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.637
Well, I read that the gift
for the 20th anniversary is china.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.075
That's a picture of China.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.668
What do you want from me?

01:38.880 --> 01:41.713
Hey, I could have got you
a Chicago Bears mug with a fill-up...

01:41.920 --> 01:44.912
...but I said,
"No. My wife's anniversary...

01:45.120 --> 01:47.839
...here's the nickel,
give me the postcard."

01:49.280 --> 01:54.035
- Happy anniversary, babe.
- AI, you never get me anything good.

01:54.240 --> 01:58.279
For our 15th anniversary
you got me some motor oil.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.597
Hey, that motor oil's still in your car.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.199
Well, this year
I want something special.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.198
- Oh, all right, how much?
- What I want won't cost you a thing.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.039
I wanna be made love to.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.876
And you think that's
not gonna cost me anything?

02:19.080 --> 02:24.438
And I am not just talking about sex, Al.
I wanna be made love to.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.834
What in sam hill does that mean?

02:30.440 --> 02:34.672
I wanna be held, I wanna be caressed,
I wanna be romanced.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.598
Peg, wait a second. I've been
secretly hiding a hundred bucks.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.635
What say I just give it to you
and we call it even.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.759
No. I want some romance
in my life, Al.

02:50.960 --> 02:56.159
And I'm not talking about the old
30-second crash-and-burn.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.478
Or the old
20-second bump-and-snore.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.910
And I really don't want
that old New Year's Eve:

03:03.120 --> 03:05.918
"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two...

03:06.120 --> 03:07.997
Sorry, better luck next year."

03:09.480 --> 03:13.951
Peg. Peg, please reconsider. Please,
if you have any feelings for me...

03:14.160 --> 03:16.833
...don't make me make love to you,
babe, please.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.554
Peg, do you hate me that much?

03:20.560 --> 03:22.755
Come on, Bud.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.715
They are just about to announce
the winner...

03:29.920 --> 03:32.798
...for My Dinner
With Anthrax contest.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.037
Where's the remote?
Where is the remote?

03:50.840 --> 03:53.877
Okay, I got a plan.
Dad once told me about the old days.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.789
People would actually walk over
to the TV and turn it on.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.837
Go on.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.395
I'm not kidding. Just might work.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.437
Now's the moment
you've been waiting for.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.029
It's time to pick the winner
of The Video Channel's...

04:16.240 --> 04:18.959
...My Dinner With Anthrax contest.
Yes.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.515
And as you can see,
the guys are pretty excited.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.473
We pay for a party in your house,
including dinner for you...

04:25.680 --> 04:30.196
...and 50 of your closest friends,
and Anthrax will rock your house off.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.630
Yeah, is that right, guys?

04:35.560 --> 04:40.395
I am dying. Wouldn't it be so cool
if Anthrax came to our house?

04:40.600 --> 04:44.195
Sure, it'd be great for them,
because they'd get to meet me.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.512
Grand Master B and Anthrax.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.393
They think they're
getting some now...

04:54.960 --> 04:57.269
Gee, Thigh Master...

04:58.040 --> 05:02.352
...shouldn't you be undressing yourself
with your eyes about now?

05:02.560 --> 05:03.993
Hush, hush, sweet harlot...

05:04.200 --> 05:06.156
...they're gonna announce
the winner now.

05:06.360 --> 05:11.434
And the lucky winner is
Bud "Grinch Master B" Bundy.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.554
I won. I won! Me!

05:20.760 --> 05:23.513
Anthrax is coming here!
Anthrax is coming here!

05:23.720 --> 05:25.995
I'm having a party.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.430
Gee, Bud, 50 of your closest friends.

05:28.640 --> 05:32.030
I guess that would be Grandma
and a bunch of stuffed animals, huh?

05:33.640 --> 05:36.518
Yeah, and my favourite
future welfare mother.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.198
Speaking of which,
we've gotta get rid of Mom and Dad.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.233
Oh, yeah, them.
Yeah, they'd be great with Anthrax.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.479
Mom getting out her accordion and
playing songs of her stinking youth.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.998
And Dad saying, " Do any of you guys
wanna see my bathroom?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.794
The flush will suck your arm
right down."

05:57.320 --> 05:59.311
Well, maybe they'll listen to reason.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.549
- Hey, Dad...
- Go away.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.990
- Dad, this isn't about money.
- Go away anyhow.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.352
Dad, we wanna throw a party
on the 30th. Can we, please?

06:11.560 --> 06:12.993
Absolutely not.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.034
I have something very important to do
that night. Requires total silence.

06:17.240 --> 06:22.155
I can't get too technical, but it involves
your mother, our anniversary...

06:22.360 --> 06:25.318
...and me making love to her
till I shrivel up and die.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.389
Now, you're too young
to hear any more. Excuse me.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.558
I'm going to go outside
and walk blindly in traffic.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.717
Are you feeling better, Al?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.595
Okay, now that you're
more composed...

06:44.800 --> 06:47.758
...could you tell me what you
were doing sitting behind my car...

06:47.960 --> 06:50.713
...with the exhaust pipe
in your mouth?

06:52.400 --> 06:55.551
My wife wants me
to make love to her.

06:58.600 --> 07:03.594
Well, then shouldn't she be the one
with her mouth on the exhaust pipe?

07:08.640 --> 07:12.155
You don't understand. She wants me
to hold her and to kiss her...

07:12.360 --> 07:16.558
...and tell her how happy she's made
me feel. Look at me, I'm shivering.

07:16.760 --> 07:20.878
- Parts of me have fainted.
- You can do it, Al.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.311
Wilt Chamberlain claims to have
made love to over 20,000 women.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.717
Yeah, and not one of them
was his wife.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.198
All right, come on, you can do it, Al.
First you...

07:33.400 --> 07:36.915
You put on some music,
and then you turn the lights down low.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.348
- Low?
- Yeah.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.073
- Low?
- Yeah.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.510
Then I can still see her.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.439
Al, Al, come on. Hey.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.110
Then they like you
to slowly undress them.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.518
Then you lower her gently onto
the bed, and eight hours later it's over.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.188
- Eight... Eight hours?
- Yeah.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.517
Eight hours, oh, God, the humanity.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.350
Hold me, Jefferson.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.590
- You can do it, big guy.
- No, I can't. You don't understand.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.712
It's my wife, it's just not right.

08:13.720 --> 08:19.750
It's your own fault
for being so damn desirable, Al.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.838
Yes, you're right.
Of course I see that now.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.873
When my look says yes,
how can I say no?

08:31.800 --> 08:33.438
Well, I must prepare myself.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.397
What are you gonna do,
some wind sprints?

08:37.600 --> 08:40.592
No, no, I'm going to the magazine
stand, get a copy of Big 'Uns...

08:40.799 --> 08:45.999
...and a great big bottle of Dramamine
for the she-sickness.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.950
- Hey, Dad.
- Go away.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.108
So, Bud, what about my idea
of getting rid of Mom and Dad?

08:56.320 --> 09:00.108
Kel, I think dropping a safe on them
would kill them.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.271
It never killed Daffy or Elmer.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.708
Or that dog that's always
after the Road Runner.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.237
Well, Kel, I guess as long as
old men in hats drive cars...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.635
...and pass out lollipops,
you'll be fine.

09:17.880 --> 09:21.395
Now, let me think.
Let's see, it's their anniversary.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.273
Wish we had enough money
to send them on a vacation.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.677
Well, why don't we send them
on one of these free vacations.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.030
You moron,
these aren't free vacations.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.470
These are time-sharing deals,
they're total scams.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.353
They get you down there,
they try to make you buy land...

09:36.560 --> 09:40.473
...they don't leave you alone
for two solid days. It's torture. It's hell.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.432
It's perfect.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.034
Gee, I can't believe we're in Florida.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.435
Why, if it wasn't for
the thousand-degree heat...

10:04.640 --> 10:09.316
...the flying palmetto bugs
and the smell of your frying feet...

10:09.520 --> 10:11.988
...I'd think we were in heaven.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.634
It was nice of the kids
to send us, though.

10:14.840 --> 10:19.470
- It's kind of romantic, huh?
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.430
Well, I guess that's it.
Happy anniversary, baby.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.030
- Bellboy!
- No, no, no, Al.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.674
I want the whole enchilada.

10:38.880 --> 10:42.111
You know, the whole four yards.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.558
That's nine yards, Peg.

10:46.080 --> 10:50.437
Do you really want me
to get out the ruler, Al?

10:52.320 --> 10:53.639
Now, let's get to it.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.434
Oh, all right, go lay down,
I have to prepare myself.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.396
Let's jam.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.952
Don't mind me,
I'm just setting up here.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.077
Hi, Stan Mendelson,
call me Captain Scooter.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.716
I just wanna extend an official welcome
to Hurricane Hole...

12:13.920 --> 12:17.993
...soon to be sunny Florida's
finest resort community.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.112
Let me get that lizard there for you.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.117
- So. You busy?
- Not really.

12:30.320 --> 12:35.235
Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is kind of our vacation.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.032
How pathetic is that?

12:37.240 --> 12:40.152
But you got your job to do
and I got mine, right?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.079
So this is an artist's conception...

12:43.280 --> 12:46.556
...of what Hurricane Hole will look like
when it's finished...

12:46.760 --> 12:49.035
...sometime in the year 3000.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.074
Well, let's talk luxury,
let's talk condos.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.555
Hey, I see you got a copy
of Big 'Uns there.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.558
I had a letter in the last issue.

12:58.760 --> 13:04.073
But, you know, if you really
wanna see some "big 'uns"...

13:04.280 --> 13:06.748
...take a look at this house.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.030
Damn kids.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.676
I think they tricked us.
We're here in this sweltering hell...

13:12.880 --> 13:15.917
...and they're having the wildest time
of their lives back home.

13:16.120 --> 13:21.433
How about that, Chicago? Ten feet
of snow and the city's at a standstill.

13:22.160 --> 13:26.915
I bet the only place that's hot
is the party at Bud Bundy's house...

13:27.120 --> 13:30.795
...where Anthrax
is rocking the roof off.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.958
They must be having one great time.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.871
Well, that's guest number 50
that's snowed in and can't make it.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.913
I guess it means
more Anthrax for us.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.398
"Let's get there early," you said.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.477
"For once let's
be responsible," you said.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.592
"That dog won't take a whiz
on my guitar," you said.

13:52.680 --> 13:56.832
I'm not so sure it was the dog,
Mr. Two-Six-Packs-of-Malt-Liquor.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.518
Well, looks like
it's just gonna be us.

14:01.720 --> 14:06.271
That's okay. We can still
have fun together. Right, guys?

14:08.600 --> 14:11.956
Well, here's a little game I know
that can break the ice at any party.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.799
We say our first names,
and then the name of an animal...

14:15.000 --> 14:18.709
...that begins with the same letter.
I'll go first.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.189
Bud. Bear.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.428
Go on.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.438
Dan. Bite me.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.756
Now... Now, right off, Dan,
that's too many words.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.109
Hi.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.999
I just came by to check on you.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.715
Oh, I see you have some killers over.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.677
Very nice. I'm Marcie.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.757
Nice to meet you, sir.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.631
I am a woman.

15:04.240 --> 15:08.074
Yeah, right. And he's a rap star...

15:08.280 --> 15:11.670
...and she's a genius,
and we're glad to be here.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.873
Well, anyway, your mother and father
asked me to look in on you...

15:18.080 --> 15:22.153
...while they were out of town to make
sure everything's on the up and up.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.031
My, you're young and firm.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.152
Thanks, mister.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.511
Relax, Mrs. D'Arcy,
they're famous musicians.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.075
We won them in a contest.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.949
Musicians, eh? Well, I don't want you
to think I'm unhip.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.277
I chased the Monkees
like everyone else.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.040
Yeah, I bet they were
running like hell.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.597
Well, I liked Peter.
He was the shy one.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.189
Which one of you is the shy one?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.834
Not me, I wear the hat.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.237
Hey, let's get this little guy's shovel
and dig a tunnel out of here.

16:13.800 --> 16:17.315
Sorry, guys,
but you're going nowhere.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.318
According to this contract,
you owe us a song first.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.512
Hey, it's supposed to be
dinner with Anthrax. Dinner.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.551
I play nothing till I eat.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.110
In case you're wondering,
I'm the hungry one.

16:31.960 --> 16:35.157
Well, let's go over to the fridge
and see what we got to eat.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.550
Hey, do you guys do
"I'm a Believer"?

16:39.760 --> 16:43.435
Because Micky used to really
rock out on that one.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.509
- Wow, the desolation.
- It's not totally empty.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.756
There's a Chia Pet in there.

16:54.920 --> 16:58.310
That... That's not a Chia Pet.
That was a meat loaf.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.996
But there's always Mom's
aluminium-foil-wrapped mystery pack.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.873
- Food.
- Man, I am starving.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.713
They're gonna eat
the mystery pack.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.673
Even Dad won't eat the mystery pack.
These guys are cool.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.353
Wow, the colours.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.877
- The colours.
- Is your hunk moving?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.159
Oh, it's biting me.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.078
If it came out of the fridge,
why is it hot?

17:37.360 --> 17:40.909
I see 50 people now. Let's jam.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.799
Go ahead, see what it's like...

19:00.000 --> 19:02.639
...to come home to your wife
in Hurricane Hole.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.875
Look, Peg, I'm home.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.470
Look, Stan, my husband's a moron.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.556
Now, look, it's our anniversary.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.194
You could at least have the decency
to step outside...

19:22.400 --> 19:24.868
...and give us three seconds
to have sex.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.036
Not until I've played my trump card.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.913
Folks, if you buy here
in Hurricane Hole...

19:30.120 --> 19:35.558
...your celebrity neighbour will be, yes,
Edd "Kookie" Byrnes.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.158
Have a comb, fans.

19:50.360 --> 19:56.549
Oh, Al, it's former teen idol
and star of 77 Sunset Strip...

19:56.760 --> 19:58.239
...Edd "Kookie" Byrnes.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.836
Oh, man.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.873
So, Kook, tell the folks
why you bought here in Hurricane Hole.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.959
- You gave me one for free, Stan.
- Good, Kook.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.628
So, what do you say, folks?
It's just 6 dollars down.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.956
I don't have that kind of money.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.832
Come on, everyone has
that kind of money, even Kookie.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.833
Well, you see, my husband
is a shoe salesman.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.596
Let's go, Kook.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.397
Be out by dawn.

20:32.640 --> 20:36.189
Oh, Al, Kookie spoke to me.
Let's do it on his combs.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.073
Well, wait a second, Peg,
Kookie stole my copy of Big 'Uns.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.236
Come on, now,
I want my anniversary present.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.795
Well, Peg, I can't do it
without my copy of Big 'Uns.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.437
- Yes, you can.
- Kookie. Kookie, lend me my Big 'Uns.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.594
You kids should be ashamed
of yourselves.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.839
Having a party while I was stuck down
in a swamp having sex with your mother.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.878
I never wanna go back
to either place again.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.638
Where's my fun?

21:13.840 --> 21:17.879
Al, like you,
the kids just did their best.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.152
- I'm sorry about everything, Mom.
- Yeah, happy anniversary.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.352
- Did you get us anything good?
- Well, we didn't have much money...

21:24.560 --> 21:28.439
...so we got the only thing
we could afford. It's out on the porch.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.752
Hey, kids.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.913
Hey, as soon as I bring in the rest
of your bags, I got a treat for you.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.635
Yep. Kookie, Kookie,
lend me your comb.

21:44.440 --> 21:45.839
Who's he?

21:46.040 --> 21:48.634
That's Kookie. Your mother said
she'd walk and feed him...

21:48.840 --> 21:51.718
...but you know the first rainy night
who's gonna be doing it.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.592
Who are those guys
out on the stoop?

21:53.800 --> 21:55.995
Oh, that's the band Anthrax.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.556
They ate Mom's mystery pack, so
the Environmental Protection Agency...

21:59.760 --> 22:03.036
...quarantined them to our house
for six months.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.398
What horrible sounds am I gonna have
to be listening to for the next half-year?

22:11.305 --> 22:17.292
