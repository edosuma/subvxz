01:10.993 --> 01:14.594
ABOUT THE NATURE
OF GOOD STORYTELLING,

01:14.596 --> 01:18.398
BUT JUDGING FROM YOUR STORIES,
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF YOU

01:18.400 --> 01:22.035

IN THE WIND

01:22.037 --> 01:25.972

AN INSTRUMENT.

01:53.903 --> 01:58.609
OR EMOTION THAT REFLECTS
YOUR OWN HUMAN EXPERIENCE?

02:00.075 --> 02:03.978
WHAT MATTERS
IS WHERE IT COMES FROM.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.514
THAT IT COMES FROM YOU.

02:06.516 --> 02:08.749
THAT'S RIGHT.

THAT IS RIGHT,
AND IN THAT WAY,
