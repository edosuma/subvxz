because I do. I'm still
Stage 4, and I'm stable.

hard day at work

that you're now Stage 5

08:02.224 --> 08:03.887

08:03.989 --> 08:05.682
which would disqualify you
from the trial.

08:05.784 --> 08:07.689
You want to run labs,
you should definitely run them.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.127
I'm good getting my hands dirty.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.169
The kind of firefighter
you'll be?

09:56.271 --> 09:58.195
That's up to you.

09:58.297 --> 10:01.169
All right, time for checkouts.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.276
(music playing quietly)

10:11.510 --> 10:13.783
Day off in the middle
of the week?

10:13.885 --> 10:15.355
You losing your
touch, Shar?

10:15.457 --> 10:17.284
Ah. Why don't you
ever tell us

10:17.386 --> 10:18.985
when you come to town, Luke?
'Cause you know me.

10:19.087 --> 10:20.956
I like to make
an entrance.

10:21.058 --> 10:23.255
The drop-ins drive
your brother crazy.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.131
Yeah, well, I also
like to do that.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.125
(both laugh)

10:27.227 --> 10:29.328
Yes, but that kind
of attitude

10:29.430 --> 10:32.104
is what got you uninvited
to Christmas 2012.

10:32.206 --> 10:35.565
Hey, he used to lock me in the
basement when we were younger.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.103
I ruined the tri-tip
he had smoking for days.

10:37.205 --> 10:38.570
It's a holiday
tradition.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.106
It's like Elf on the Shelf
or the Christmas Pickle.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.841
But with grunts and grudges.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.074
Me and my brother send each
other<i> New Yorker</i> articles.

10:45.176 --> 10:46.548
We player Wordle.

10:46.650 --> 10:48.454
Such nerds!

10:48.556 --> 10:50.515
What are you
doing here?

10:50.617 --> 10:52.515
You're really
here for work?
Yeah.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.050
I'm trying to get you
a new fire camp.

10:54.152 --> 10:56.419
Oh, that is you

10:56.521 --> 10:58.494
getting me the money
for Red River?

10:58.596 --> 10:59.732
That is me.

10:59.834 --> 11:01.535
And I'm using
Three Rock as a model.

11:01.637 --> 11:03.732
I saw Bode up
there just now.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.168
Shar, he looks fantastic.

11:07.135 --> 11:08.965
What's this? You all good?

11:09.067 --> 11:10.640
Oh, yeah.

11:10.742 --> 11:12.038
I just had a physical today.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.606
BARTENDER: There you are.
Ah.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.439
Thank you.
Okay, I don't want
to hold you up.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.309
No, uh, why don't you
join me, you know?

11:18.411 --> 11:20.381
We can run the budget
on Red River,

11:20.483 --> 11:22.380
or whatever. I just want
to lend a hand while I'm here.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.687
Well, you know
I'm a total control freak

11:24.790 --> 11:26.521
when it comes
to budgets.

11:27.324 --> 11:29.453
Yeah, well, you always
did work too hard.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.291
I keep telling
my bum big brother

11:31.393 --> 11:33.090
to take you on vacation,
but he won't listen.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.192
Vacations make me itchy.

11:35.294 --> 11:36.593
But come by the house.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.765
I can smoke the tri-tip
for all of us.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.099
Fair enough.

11:40.201 --> 11:42.435
I'll see you around.
Okay.

11:51.612 --> 11:54.178
You have any tips for
replacing a saw chain

11:54.280 --> 11:56.680
without the makeover?

12:00.128 --> 12:02.191
Um...

12:03.398 --> 12:05.190
Why is Bode calling you?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.994
What are you talking about?

12:07.096 --> 12:08.696
Your phone rang
earlier today.

12:08.798 --> 12:10.430
I answered it.

12:11.735 --> 12:13.329
It was Bode.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.068
You went through my phone?

12:15.170 --> 12:16.299
The call was
from Three Rock.

12:16.401 --> 12:19.175
I thought it was your dad.

12:20.409 --> 12:22.706
Why is he calling you?
We talk sometimes.

12:23.684 --> 12:25.680
You talk sometimes?
Yes.

12:25.782 --> 12:27.377
About fire camp.

12:27.479 --> 12:29.713
You know that I talk to the guys

12:29.815 --> 12:32.051
on my dad's crew a lot.
It's good for them

12:32.153 --> 12:33.819
to have support out here.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.829
Bode's not like the other guys
you've looked out for before.

12:35.931 --> 12:38.089
I believe in what my dad
is selling at fire camp.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.596
People can change, Jake.

12:40.698 --> 12:42.396
No, not Bode.

12:42.498 --> 12:44.796
Baby, he will take
advantage of your generosity.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.500
I already have my dad
questioning my choices.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.338
I do not need
to hear it from you, too.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.445
DISPATCH: Vegetation fire.
(alarm ringing)

12:52.547 --> 12:54.638
1512 Frost Creek Road.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.541
Three Rock crew
en route to assist.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.481
You're supposed
to be in my corner.

12:58.583 --> 12:59.742
I am, Gabs.

12:59.844 --> 13:02.121
First call, probies.
Get some, be safe.

13:02.223 --> 13:04.015
FIREFIGHTER:
Let's go, probies.
Get the lead out.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.354
(sirens wailing)

13:08.219 --> 13:09.522
(sighs)

13:09.624 --> 13:11.288
I don't see
how can people live out here

13:11.390 --> 13:12.825
in the middle of nowhere.

13:13.728 --> 13:16.936
Just keep your eyes peeled
for our nearest plug.

13:19.264 --> 13:21.567
(phone rings)

13:23.101 --> 13:25.172
Hey.

13:25.274 --> 13:27.914
So? Any news from
the appointment?

13:28.016 --> 13:30.309
Your brother's in town.
Yeah, that's...

13:30.411 --> 13:31.880
not the news I was looking for.

13:31.982 --> 13:33.545
What's he doing here?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.512
He's helping me
get Red River built.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.490
And he went to see Bode.
Uh-huh.

13:37.592 --> 13:38.891
Anything to show me up.

13:38.993 --> 13:41.488
I think he's just being
a good uncle.

13:41.590 --> 13:43.323
You know he's always had
a soft spot for Bode.

13:43.426 --> 13:45.622
Also, he saw
my blood-draw bandage.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.194
So if he asks, I'm fine,
because I am.

13:48.296 --> 13:50.194
Are you taking it easy today?

13:50.296 --> 13:52.532
Hey, is Sharon okay?

13:52.634 --> 13:54.603
Is Jake there?
Don't worry him with this.

13:54.705 --> 13:56.800
She's fine.

13:59.175 --> 14:00.938
<i> Sorry, babe, I got to go.</i>

14:01.040 --> 14:03.674
Let me know if you hear
anything, all right? Love you.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.342
DISPATCH:
Three Rock Four, Engine 1568.

14:06.444 --> 14:07.978
We've got a locked gate.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.546
(grunts)

14:10.648 --> 14:12.754
Cutters aren't making a dent.

14:12.856 --> 14:14.184
Hey, Chief?

14:14.286 --> 14:16.257
How can we help?

14:16.360 --> 14:18.892
Any of your guys know
how to pick a lock?

14:18.994 --> 14:20.695
Seriously?

14:20.797 --> 14:22.826
Had to ask.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.435
Well, I could always drive
the rig through it.

14:27.537 --> 14:30.834
Out here, damaging the truck?
It's a no-go.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.671
Gentlemen, meet Freddy.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.849
For the record,
I learned this

14:36.952 --> 14:38.945
the summer I worked
at my uncle's

14:39.047 --> 14:40.477
locksmith shop.

14:40.579 --> 14:43.180
Got a pocket knife?
Yeah.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.951
Have at it.

14:45.053 --> 14:46.986
Thanks, brother.

14:47.088 --> 14:49.391
All right.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.932
Thing's too rusted.

14:57.034 --> 14:58.527
Do what you got to do.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.168
Tear down the whole thing down

15:00.270 --> 15:01.364
if you have to,
but get us in here.

15:01.466 --> 15:03.269
ASAP.
All right.

15:03.371 --> 15:05.511
Can I have some tension on it?

15:05.613 --> 15:07.543
All right. Keep my pace.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.411
Copy.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.391
(grunts)
There you go.

15:18.493 --> 15:20.349
Attaboy, Goat.

15:20.451 --> 15:22.996
There you go.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.066
Strong assist there,
firefighter.

15:31.202 --> 15:32.999
Good work out
there, Freddy.

15:33.101 --> 15:34.398
Thanks, Cap.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.499
All right, gentlemen.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.902
We are dozens of miles

15:39.004 --> 15:41.674
away from a station
or a water hydrant.

15:41.776 --> 15:43.745
That means backup isn't
just minutes away.

15:43.847 --> 15:46.111
So I'm gonna need all of you
at your very best, all right?

15:46.213 --> 15:47.911
Copy that.

15:56.157 --> 15:58.293
What's wrong?

15:58.395 --> 16:01.361
Nothing. I busted
the gate open.

16:01.463 --> 16:03.635
Sure, but what's up
with your hand?

16:03.737 --> 16:05.198
Would you be quiet?

16:05.300 --> 16:07.937
(quietly):
You okay?

16:08.039 --> 16:09.942
Caught it on the gate.

16:10.045 --> 16:12.537
You need stitches, dude.
Hey, what? No.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.608
No, no, no, you can't tell Cap.

16:15.617 --> 16:17.249
I have to.
Why?

16:17.351 --> 16:19.212
Because First Saw is going
to your head already?

16:19.315 --> 16:21.788
Well, because you're hurt.

16:21.890 --> 16:23.648
Hey, wait, wait,
you're one of us.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.325
You're supposed to be
on our side.

16:25.427 --> 16:27.388
I am.

16:27.491 --> 16:29.992
But, Freddy,
you can't work like this.

16:30.094 --> 16:31.327
I'll muscle through it.

16:31.429 --> 16:33.024
Remember when Julio
rolled his ankle?

16:33.127 --> 16:36.564
He was dead weight, so they
sent him back to Lancaster.

16:36.666 --> 16:39.000
He still hasn't managed
to get back to camp.

16:39.102 --> 16:41.632
Lancaster swallowed him.

16:41.734 --> 16:45.073
I did not do well there,
for real.

16:45.175 --> 16:47.810
I can't go back, Bode.

16:47.912 --> 16:50.713
Cover for me.

16:50.815 --> 16:52.844
Please.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.132
MANNY:
Head out, let's go!

17:06.234 --> 17:08.729
We got a three-acre fire,
moderate rate of spread.

17:08.831 --> 17:12.004
Getting into the timber,
two structures threatened.

17:12.106 --> 17:13.336
Claws at the ready, guys.
Got it, Cap!

17:13.438 --> 17:14.440
GABRIELA: We're pretty
alone out here, huh?

17:14.542 --> 17:15.909
You, you.

17:16.011 --> 17:17.934
Do a search of the house
for civilians.

17:18.036 --> 17:19.669
Tell them to evac immediately.
On it.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.443
Fire's backing down the hills.

17:21.545 --> 17:23.949
If we act fast,
we can stop it in its tracks.

17:24.051 --> 17:26.285
We're gonna hold
and anchor here.

17:26.387 --> 17:28.978
Three Rock, you're gonna
improve the line by the road.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.255
Copy that, Chief.
With limited resources,

17:31.357 --> 17:33.124
we are going
to prioritize the house

17:33.227 --> 17:35.193
over the barn.
Who can tell me why?

17:35.295 --> 17:36.858
The amount of hay
and machinery around it.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.729
If it ignites, it would take way
too much water to put it out.

17:39.831 --> 17:42.696
More than we can spare for
a structure with no life in it.

17:43.969 --> 17:46.302
Right. No hydrants.

17:46.404 --> 17:48.302
That engine's
our only source of water.

17:48.404 --> 17:50.340
MANNY:
Bode, you're out front.

17:50.442 --> 17:52.374
Let's go, gentlemen,
eight to ten feet apart.

17:52.477 --> 17:54.108
BODE:
All right. Follow me, guys.

17:54.210 --> 17:56.047
You made Bode First Saw?

17:56.149 --> 17:59.175
Yes, sir. Your kid's a natural.

17:59.277 --> 18:01.619
A little external support
never hurt anybody though.

18:01.721 --> 18:03.055
Yeah.

18:03.158 --> 18:05.425
Your kid's got
a knack for it, too.

18:05.527 --> 18:07.020
Great.

18:07.122 --> 18:09.686
FIREFIGHTER (over radio):
House is clear, Chief.
Copy.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.663
Let's go, everybody, move, move!

18:11.765 --> 18:14.531
First Saw, huh?

18:14.633 --> 18:17.899
What's it feel like to have
my dad recognize your hustle?

18:18.001 --> 18:19.968
I thought we were gonna stop
caring what they thought of us.

18:20.070 --> 18:21.968
You're right.

18:22.070 --> 18:24.541
We should start holding
each other accountable on it.

18:24.643 --> 18:27.675
Hey, you got dad stuff
to talk out, I'm your guy.

18:30.342 --> 18:33.417
Look, I'm, uh, sorry if I
crossed a line by calling you.

18:33.519 --> 18:35.285
I wanted to wish you luck
on your first day.

18:35.388 --> 18:38.156
But you hung up,
and I can take a hint.

18:38.259 --> 18:40.817
MANNY:
Hey, Freddy, swamp for Bode.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.295
He needs someone
who can keep up.

18:44.394 --> 18:47.090
Let's go, come on, come on!

18:55.644 --> 18:57.066
(saw revs)

18:57.168 --> 18:58.940
VINCE:
Copy that.
Bumping up the pressure.

18:59.042 --> 19:01.610
On it.

19:07.616 --> 19:10.454
Gabriela,
she's got good instincts.

19:13.091 --> 19:15.919
Or... am I off?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.928
What's the deal,
you worried about her?

19:18.030 --> 19:19.932
Something like that.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.725
Well, she's one of us now, Jake.

19:22.827 --> 19:24.861
Better get used to it.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.871
I worked my
entire career

19:27.973 --> 19:29.405
with my wife.

19:29.508 --> 19:31.406
Sharon and I,
we-we love this job.

19:31.508 --> 19:34.076
Love this work, love this life.

19:34.178 --> 19:36.546
You want
my advice?

19:37.875 --> 19:40.719
Just enjoy it together.

19:40.821 --> 19:42.312
WOMAN:
Reese!

19:42.414 --> 19:43.852
Reese!

19:43.954 --> 19:45.552
JAKE:
I thought they said
they searched the house.

19:45.654 --> 19:47.860
It's not coming from the house.

19:47.963 --> 19:49.724
We got people in the barn.

19:51.127 --> 19:52.425
Hey.

19:52.528 --> 19:54.190
You need to evacuate. Now.

19:54.292 --> 19:56.065
We're trying, but
Henry's scared, and...

19:56.167 --> 19:57.932
I can't get him to leave
and we can't leave him.
(horse nickering)

19:58.035 --> 20:00.535
I don't know what
to do. What do I do?
(horse snorts)

20:00.638 --> 20:02.237
All right. Slow down.
(nickering)

20:02.340 --> 20:04.440
Anybody else in here with you?

20:04.542 --> 20:06.712
Just my daughter and Henry.
(neighs)

20:06.814 --> 20:08.110
(snorting)

20:08.212 --> 20:10.179
Okay. My name is Vince.

20:10.281 --> 20:11.411
Uh, I understand this horse

20:11.514 --> 20:12.546
means a lot
to you, but...

20:12.648 --> 20:13.676
He means more
than a lot.

20:13.778 --> 20:14.978
He's family.
(crying)

20:15.080 --> 20:17.485
I'm Ali.
This is my daughter, Reese.

20:17.587 --> 20:19.850
Listen, we're
gonna do everything

20:19.952 --> 20:21.191
that we can
to save the horse...

20:21.293 --> 20:22.692
Henry.
Right. Henry.

20:22.794 --> 20:24.458
We're gonna do everything
that we can to save Henry.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.055
But, right now, I need you two

20:26.158 --> 20:28.461
to come with me
and get out of here. Okay?

20:28.563 --> 20:30.296
Henry was my
dad's horse.

20:30.398 --> 20:32.500
My dad's baby.

20:32.602 --> 20:34.802
He called Henry
my brother.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.640
I remember your dad.

20:37.742 --> 20:39.374
Used to come into Smokey's
every Sunday,

20:39.476 --> 20:41.304
order a bacon, egg and cheese.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.747
Very sorry to hear about him
passing in the Creek Fire.

20:44.849 --> 20:47.483
Hard to believe
he's gone.
(Reese crying)

20:47.585 --> 20:49.818
ALI: Henry was
family to my dad.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.219
I can't leave family behind.
(sniffles) Would you?

20:52.321 --> 20:53.756
(nickering)

20:53.858 --> 20:57.396
Your dad would want you
to be someplace safe, not here.

20:59.564 --> 21:01.067
Okay, it's time
to go, sweet Reesie.

21:01.169 --> 21:02.367
(sniffles)
What about Henry?

21:02.469 --> 21:03.903
The firefighters
will get him out, okay?

21:04.005 --> 21:05.767
Okay.
Say goodbye.

21:06.667 --> 21:07.971
(nickers)
(shudders)

21:08.073 --> 21:09.308
Bye, Henry.

21:09.410 --> 21:11.773
Okay, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.
(crying)

21:12.938 --> 21:14.646
I got him.
Go ahead.

21:15.449 --> 21:17.115
Out that door.
To the left. Hurry up.

21:17.217 --> 21:18.980
All right. Let's go, Henry.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.850
(neighs)

21:20.953 --> 21:22.544
Come on.

21:22.647 --> 21:24.247
(neighs)

21:25.023 --> 21:26.725
(neighs)

21:26.827 --> 21:28.058
(sighs)

21:28.160 --> 21:30.024
Henry. Come on. Come on.

21:30.127 --> 21:31.127
(neighs)

21:31.229 --> 21:33.366
(chainsaw buzzing)

21:37.538 --> 21:39.832
Come on. Let's go.
I'm doing the best I can.

21:39.935 --> 21:41.372
It's not good enough
with your busted hand.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.473
(panting)
Look, we got to tell Cap.

21:43.575 --> 21:44.872
It's too late.
We already hid it.

21:44.974 --> 21:47.276
Now he'll be pissed
at me<i> and</i> you

21:47.378 --> 21:48.637
on your first day in charge.

21:48.739 --> 21:50.181
No way.

21:50.283 --> 21:51.648
We're not
telling. No way.

21:52.951 --> 21:55.651
A-At least let me bandage it,
give your hand some stability.

21:55.753 --> 21:57.915
We've got an uncooperative
horse in the barn.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.181
I'm closing him in there
for now,

21:59.284 --> 22:00.925
but the barn just became
our priority.

22:01.027 --> 22:02.952
Copy, Captain.
Why would we want to keep
the horse in the barn?

22:03.054 --> 22:04.328
Why not let him out
to escape?

22:04.430 --> 22:06.960
Because the horse
is uncooperative.

22:07.062 --> 22:08.561
Letting him loose
would be a worse liability.

22:08.663 --> 22:09.629
Were you not listening?

22:09.731 --> 22:12.102
I'm asking questions
to learn.

22:12.204 --> 22:13.171
Probies, follow me.

22:13.273 --> 22:14.639
That is not the way you speak

22:14.741 --> 22:16.500
to a superior
officer, probie.
JAKE: Whoa,

22:16.602 --> 22:18.667
whoa.
Oh. I'm surprised you're
even speaking to me at all.

22:18.769 --> 22:20.337
You want me to report you to the
chief? Is that what you want me

22:20.439 --> 22:22.478
you want me to do?
For what?
For doing my job?

22:22.580 --> 22:24.314
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
Gabriela, now is not the time
for you to be a stubborn...

22:24.416 --> 22:26.647
Listen! The two of you, stop.

22:26.749 --> 22:28.921
Both of you guys,
step away.

22:29.023 --> 22:30.085
Probies,
to the barn.

22:30.187 --> 22:31.714
(sighs)

22:31.816 --> 22:33.393
All of you.

22:35.929 --> 22:37.588
Damn it.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.392
Really, Manny?

22:38.494 --> 22:41.429
On-on her first day?

22:41.532 --> 22:43.568
She was out of line, Jake.

22:44.502 --> 22:46.204
And you're
about to be.

22:46.306 --> 22:47.371
I outrank you.
Yeah.

22:47.473 --> 22:48.807
Don't you forget it.
Yeah, okay.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.438
Okay.

22:50.541 --> 22:52.775
(indistinct radio chatter)

22:57.083 --> 22:58.818
First Saw.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.150
Where's Bode?

23:00.252 --> 23:01.682
Haven't seen him.

23:01.784 --> 23:04.157
Go. You need
real treatment.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.382
I told you,
I'll get sent back.

23:07.158 --> 23:08.594
(groans)

23:08.696 --> 23:11.989
What the hell are you two doing
freelancing over here?

23:12.091 --> 23:13.732
What's going on?
Let me see that.

23:13.835 --> 23:14.857
(groans)

23:14.959 --> 23:16.498
(panting)
Damn.

23:16.600 --> 23:17.597
That already looks infected.

23:17.699 --> 23:19.432
When did this happen?

23:19.534 --> 23:20.697
At the gate.

23:20.799 --> 23:21.868
At the gate?

23:21.970 --> 23:23.372
Why didn't you say something
to me then?

23:23.474 --> 23:25.577
Bode, you knew about this?

23:26.280 --> 23:27.609
Freddy, back in the carrier.

23:27.711 --> 23:29.109
I can still work.
No, you can't.

23:29.211 --> 23:30.414
You're literally on a hand crew
and your hand's

23:30.516 --> 23:31.715
out of commission. You're done.

23:32.518 --> 23:33.481
Sir, Freddy's
one of our best.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.549
And now
he's injured,

23:34.651 --> 23:35.950
which means he's dead weight.

23:36.052 --> 23:37.417
So I need you out of our way
so the rest of us

23:37.519 --> 23:38.748
can do our jobs.

23:38.850 --> 23:39.685
Back to the buggy.

23:39.788 --> 23:41.557
And you,
get back to work.

23:41.659 --> 23:43.628
We'll talk
about this later.

23:44.929 --> 23:46.464
All right, I need
both crews maintaining

23:46.566 --> 23:48.767
a clear path
from here to the engine.

23:48.870 --> 23:51.366
Sun's about to set, so make note
of any terrain hazards now.

23:51.468 --> 23:52.800
All right?
Got you.

23:52.902 --> 23:54.638
Let's go!
How we doing on water?

23:54.740 --> 23:55.969
FIREFIGHTER:
We're down to 100 gallons.

23:56.071 --> 23:58.644
Yeah, it's not enough for us
to save this barn.

23:58.746 --> 24:00.445
Don't need to save it. Just
need to buy me some time

24:00.547 --> 24:01.778
to get that horse
out of there.

24:03.518 --> 24:05.714
Great. Hey, get
some water on that.

24:05.816 --> 24:07.715
All right, take
some probies,

24:07.817 --> 24:10.751
find a water source.
Copy. With me.

24:10.853 --> 24:12.022
JAKE:
It's getting dark

24:12.124 --> 24:13.316
and, uh...

24:13.418 --> 24:15.022
well, we're in the middle
of nowhere, Chief.

24:16.087 --> 24:17.457
Work some magic, Jake.

24:17.559 --> 24:18.993
Find some water.

24:20.191 --> 24:22.326
You heard the chief.
Come on.

24:24.170 --> 24:26.499
(door opens)

24:26.601 --> 24:27.797
KHAN:
Sharon.

24:27.899 --> 24:28.906
(door closes)

24:29.009 --> 24:30.502
Ah.

24:30.604 --> 24:33.143
(exhales) Did I ever tell you
that I was in<i> The Music Man?</i>

24:33.245 --> 24:34.313
In college?

24:34.415 --> 24:37.045
Um, I was one
of the ladies.

24:37.147 --> 24:39.383
One of the "Pick-a-Little,
Give-a-Little" ladies.

24:39.485 --> 24:40.877
Sharon,
the labs came back.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.953
I know. I know. I...

24:43.055 --> 24:46.091
A doctor calls you into her
office at the end of the day

24:46.193 --> 24:47.557
to give you lab results.

24:47.659 --> 24:49.418
It's-it's-it's
not good news.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.191
You know what,
I'm-I'm just not ready.

24:51.293 --> 24:53.295
Your kidney disease
has progressed to stage 5.

24:53.397 --> 24:55.297
No. (cries)

24:55.399 --> 24:56.834
I'm so sorry.

24:56.936 --> 24:59.062
(cries, sniffles)
We need to start you
on dialysis.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.196
No, I...
And we can talk

25:00.298 --> 25:02.432
about next steps
when you're ready.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.109
(sniffles)

25:05.211 --> 25:06.870
Okay, I'm not.

25:06.972 --> 25:09.681
Okay? I'm-I'm sorry.

25:15.517 --> 25:17.051
Thanks.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.120
ALI:
Help! My daughter

25:20.222 --> 25:22.460
was in the car. Uh, I went
back to grab our go bag.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.661
I came back
and she was just gone.

25:24.763 --> 25:26.460
You're a firefighter,
right?
Yeah.

25:26.562 --> 25:28.524
Yes, yes. And-and, ma'am, you
really need to get out of here.

25:28.626 --> 25:30.868
I'm trying to,
but I can't go without my kid!

25:30.970 --> 25:33.601
I think she was looking
for our horse in the barn.

25:33.703 --> 25:35.535
Help me.
Okay, uh...

25:35.637 --> 25:37.239
stay here.

25:37.341 --> 25:39.172
Please!

25:43.615 --> 25:45.312
The entrance is blocked by fire.

25:45.414 --> 25:48.211
Wind's kicking up. That's not
gonna do us any favors.

25:48.313 --> 25:50.156
We'll cut an escape
in the back.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.684
Try to lure the horse out.

25:51.786 --> 25:53.391
I need your First Saw.

25:53.493 --> 25:55.694
<i> Trust him the most, right?</i>

25:55.796 --> 25:57.659
I wouldn't have promoted
him if I didn't, Chief.

25:57.761 --> 25:59.226
Hey, Cap! (pants)
Freddy,

25:59.328 --> 26:00.960
what are you doing? You're
supposed to be in the buggy.

26:01.062 --> 26:02.157
You trying to get
shipped back

26:02.260 --> 26:03.634
to Lancaster?
No, sir.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.298
But that mom
can't find her kid.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.568
She thinks she's in the barn
looking for the horse.

26:07.670 --> 26:08.837
Good catch, Freddy.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.838
Ah, damn it. Well,
we got the kid.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.745
Just get back in
the buggy. Go. Bode.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.248
Grab your saw.

26:16.350 --> 26:18.442
You're with the chief.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.446
Good luck.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.959
All right. With the front
entrance blocked by fire,

26:33.061 --> 26:34.394
we've got to cut
an escape back here.

26:34.497 --> 26:36.025
(grunts)

26:36.127 --> 26:37.669
(chainsaw buzzing)

26:37.771 --> 26:39.029
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Wait for my order.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.064
Keep the
bar level.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.203
I remember
from my training.

26:42.305 --> 26:44.604
Well, a kid's life is on
the line. I got to be sure.

26:44.706 --> 26:46.270
Manny's sure.

26:46.373 --> 26:48.472
He made me First Saw
for a reason.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.474
You don't have to trust me,
but trust him.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.148
(buzzing)

26:57.524 --> 26:59.553
There you go.
That's good.

26:59.655 --> 27:01.122
That's great.

27:05.761 --> 27:07.062
Good job, Bode.

27:07.164 --> 27:09.200
What are the signs
that we are near water?

27:09.302 --> 27:10.732
Lush vegetation.

27:10.834 --> 27:12.432
Cattails.
They grow by waters.

27:12.534 --> 27:13.435
Shh.

27:13.537 --> 27:14.832
(frogs croaking)

27:14.934 --> 27:16.742
Frogs like water.

27:18.102 --> 27:20.145
Wait, what's that?

27:20.247 --> 27:21.409
Smart, Perez.

27:21.511 --> 27:22.572
Let's go.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.684
All right.

27:27.451 --> 27:28.578
(grunts)

27:29.348 --> 27:32.523
(exhales)
Magic has been worked.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.456
Water coming your way shortly.

27:34.558 --> 27:37.088
VINCE:
Make it quick. We got a kid
trapped in the barn.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.226
There's a kid in there?

27:39.893 --> 27:41.459
(creaking)

27:49.506 --> 27:51.142
(coughs)

27:51.244 --> 27:52.503
Reese!

27:54.310 --> 27:56.243
We're gonna need a hose
on the Charlie side.

27:56.345 --> 27:58.111
Fire's on the move.
MAN:
Copy, Chief.

27:58.213 --> 27:59.979
All right.
I'm going in to find her.

28:00.081 --> 28:02.045
All right.
I'll finish cutting.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.515
(chainsaw buzzing)

28:07.623 --> 28:09.322
Reese?!

28:10.098 --> 28:11.960
(neighs)

28:12.062 --> 28:14.492
Reese, where are you?!
(neighing)

28:16.966 --> 28:18.533
All right, Henry. Come on.

28:18.635 --> 28:20.733
Here we go.

28:20.835 --> 28:22.368
REESE:
Help!

28:23.243 --> 28:25.140
Reese!

28:28.149 --> 28:29.039
Reese!

28:29.141 --> 28:30.041
REESE:
Help!

28:30.143 --> 28:31.809
Reese, where are you?!

28:31.911 --> 28:33.643
I'm up here!

28:36.523 --> 28:38.246
I tried
to save Henry,

28:38.348 --> 28:40.458

40:40.781 --> 40:44.005
I don't mean to cause any
trouble between you, you know?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.614
When we're just--
Oh.

40:45.717 --> 40:48.117
I told him.
You and I are friends.

40:48.219 --> 40:50.250
And friends talk.

40:50.352 --> 40:53.090
Right.

40:53.192 --> 40:55.692
Friends, yeah. Good.

I'd answer.

And if I came here
to visit you again?

41:20.754 --> 41:23.152
I don't know, I mean, my social

41:23.254 --> 41:26.954
(laughing)

41:28.226 --> 41:29.891

41:53.884 --> 41:56.014
Where we met when
my car broke down?
