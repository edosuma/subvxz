11:02.095 --> 11:04.362
the presence
of the female apparition

11:04.364 --> 11:06.931
seen by multiple people
in the castle

11:06.933 --> 11:10.268
and in the massive
underground water caverns.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.505
Alright, guys, it's day 2
of our investigation

11:13.507 --> 11:16.708
of the albion castle,
which is right there.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.610
I can see it
across the bay.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.045
So, I did a little research

11:20.047 --> 11:22.313
because we got to find
out the identity

11:22.315 --> 11:26.418
of who this woman spirit is
that's shown herself

11:26.420 --> 11:28.787
to a lot of
different people over there.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.722
They all described her
the same.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.524
So, I had to do
some research

11:32.526 --> 11:34.626
to help us try to find out
why she's there.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.928
Now, this area that
we're on right now

11:36.930 --> 11:40.532
and the area where albion castle
sits is called hunters point.

11:40.534 --> 11:44.669
This was inhabited by
the ohlone native americans.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.772
They were here
for 10,000 years.
Wow.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.175
I found out that the ohlone
would do

11:50.177 --> 11:53.611
these huge sacred
burial mounds.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.347
Zak: In many cases, the ohlone
shell mounds

11:56.349 --> 12:00.118
are said to contain children
lost at childbirth,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.986
buried next to their mothers,

12:01.988 --> 12:07.092
their bodies then covered
with soil, shells, and rock.

12:07.094 --> 12:11.362
The burial mounds are spread
out throughout this whole area,

12:11.364 --> 12:12.797
but when I looked
at the map

12:12.799 --> 12:16.501
of where these ohlone
shell mounds were,

12:16.503 --> 12:18.336
there's two of them
that were located

12:18.338 --> 12:20.138
right here
on hunters point.

12:20.140 --> 12:26.277
Right there, sitting exactly
where albion castle sits.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.679
Aaron: No way.

12:27.681 --> 12:32.851
That water that still runs
underneath albion castle today

12:32.853 --> 12:37.122
was a sacred water source
for the ohlone.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.058
There could be remains
of the ohlone

12:40.060 --> 12:42.327
underneath
of albion castle.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.829
Those mounds
could have been desecrated

12:44.831 --> 12:46.664
by modern civilization,

12:46.666 --> 12:49.334
by the buildings of what
we're looking at right now.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.537
But not only that,
the sacred water

12:52.539 --> 12:55.106
was then used to make beer.
That makes sense.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.943
So, any time that that water
source is disturbed

12:58.945 --> 13:00.979
on top
of the burial mounds

13:00.981 --> 13:03.181
that were right here
where the castle is...

13:03.183 --> 13:05.283
Yeah.
...Could ignite
the apparition

13:05.285 --> 13:08.820
of this spirit
if she is ohlone.

13:08.822 --> 13:12.724
We need to agitate that water,
but let's do it respectfully.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.660
Zak: We set up our equipment
inside the dark water cavern

13:15.662 --> 13:19.063
where gerelyn saw
the female apparition emerge.

13:19.065 --> 13:22.834
Looking beneath the dark surface
of this sacred spring

13:22.836 --> 13:26.271
may provide some evidence
to bring us closer to the spirit

13:26.273 --> 13:27.639
and why she is here.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.874
Alright, we're gonna use
this underwater camera

13:29.876 --> 13:33.878
to take a look inside
of this mineral spring water.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.447
♪♪

13:36.449 --> 13:37.782
when we look down here,
we can see

13:37.784 --> 13:42.187
that there's things
at the bottom of this.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.557
Right over here.
What is that?

13:45.559 --> 13:48.593
As we begin scanning the bottom
of this water cavern,

13:48.595 --> 13:50.929
we begin to see something.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.864
That, to me, just looks
like a rock, doesn't it?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.099
Aaron: Yeah.
So, I'm gonna scan over
a little bit more.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.701
What was that?
What's that?

13:56.703 --> 13:57.836
What is that?

13:57.838 --> 13:58.870
What is that?
What is that right there?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.638
I don't know.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.840
Billy.
Whoa. What is that?

14:01.842 --> 14:03.341
Billy: What is that?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.044
What is that?
I don't know.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.946
Oh, my god!
Look at that!

14:07.948 --> 14:09.914
Look.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.217
That's a jaw bone.
That's a jaw.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.818
See?
Yeah, those are teeth.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.986
Oh, that's teeth.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.055
Oh, whoa, you guys.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.523
Oh, my god.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.657
Do you see that?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.726
That's, like, fur?

14:21.728 --> 14:23.828
Zak: As we watch
the monitor closely,

14:23.830 --> 14:28.366
we discover what we are seeing
is a dead possum

14:28.368 --> 14:31.369
but are confused as
to how it could have drowned.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.339
I mean, look at this,
you guys.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.174
Look at the waterline
on this.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.742
It's like this.
Billy: I know.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.477
If an animal was swimming
in here,

14:39.479 --> 14:42.447
they could have easily
gotten out of here.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.782
Sure.
There's a lip
about this big.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.284
Well, it's running over
right there.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.753
It's literally level.
It's running over.

14:48.755 --> 14:52.690
And if it climbed back somewhere
back there, that's just a wall.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.958
I'm trying
to figure this out.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.394
How could an animal
have climbed up here, bill,

14:56.396 --> 14:58.596
and just died over there?

14:58.598 --> 15:01.566
But could that also be some type
of offering for this spirit?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.201
That's what
I was thinking.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.270
Zak: After seeing what's
underneath the water

15:05.272 --> 15:08.339
and capturing evidence of this
mysterious dead animal

15:08.341 --> 15:12.343
that drowned, it's now time
to see what is on the other side

15:12.345 --> 15:15.380
of this very dark
water cavern.

15:15.382 --> 15:19.751
So, billy modified this
remote-control boat.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.819
Really, billy?

15:21.821 --> 15:25.023
Hey, when you're as smart as us,
you do good, old smart things.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.326
Billy: It was too heavy, so we
had to add some pontoons.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.161
So, you can see that there's
a camera on it.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.829
Good job
modifying that, guys.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.031
Thanks.
Good job.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.667
I want to see how far
we could get back there,

15:35.669 --> 15:37.268
and what we want
to look for is,

15:37.270 --> 15:41.039
we want to see if this spirit
will manifest

15:41.041 --> 15:45.443
from something foreign
being in her water.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.211
Go ahead
and roll on that.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.551
Can we see you?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.189
There's something
in your sacred water.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.529
Can you come out of the water
like you have before?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.032
Can you show yourself?

16:10.437 --> 16:11.970
We don't want
to disrespect you

16:11.972 --> 16:16.174
or your water source
or your caverns.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.075
-Why is it...?
-I don't have anything.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.276
No.
Nothing?

16:18.278 --> 16:19.477
Aaron: Nothing.
That's weird

16:19.479 --> 16:20.945
'cause as soon
as we start talking about it,

16:20.947 --> 16:21.913
it was closer, and it glitched.
As soon as we went over there,

16:21.915 --> 16:22.981
and that's when
you felt the chills.

16:22.983 --> 16:23.982
Whoa.
Feel that.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.450
Feel that.
Oh, yeah.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.751
Can you feel that
right there?

16:26.753 --> 16:27.885
Zak: That's what I'm trying
to say.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.187
Look at right here.
Right here.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.788
Yeah, it's right here.
Literally right here.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.257
Feel this, right here.
Right there, yeah.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.860
Ice cold. Ice cold.
Yes, yeah.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.195
That made goose bumps.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.330
That made my arm hair
stand up on end, man.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.065
I'm telling you.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.233
I didn't feel any of this

16:42.235 --> 16:44.068
during the underwater
camera experiment.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.370
Now it's on me.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.838
This is all happening
with the boat in the water.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.206
Look at that.
I know. That's exactly.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.209
It went from me [bleep]
and now it's right here.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.444
We have not felt anything --
oh, my gosh!

16:53.446 --> 16:55.546
Feel this right here.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.048
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.549
I'm getting excited because
not only are we feeling this,

16:58.551 --> 17:01.486
but it's creating energy
within us.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.855
None of us have felt
what we are feeling

17:03.857 --> 17:06.124
the entire time
we've been down here,

17:06.126 --> 17:09.127
including our earlier interview
with gerelyn.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.130
There also are no drafts
in these caves.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.532
Could this be a sign
that the lady apparition

17:14.534 --> 17:19.270
is going to manifest visually
or audibly?

17:19.272 --> 17:20.905
As the boat returns to us,

17:20.907 --> 17:24.108
we notice something has happened
to the camera.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.676
No.
What?

17:25.678 --> 17:26.511
No.
It shut it off.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.979
How did it stop?

17:27.981 --> 17:30.381
There's no way
for it to stop.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.250
Why would that turn off
automatically?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.818
It shouldn't have.
That's a gopro camera.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.653
Right.
I know.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.422
There's something
happening here, you guys.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.623
There's something going on.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.658
Why would it do that?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.860
Dude, is it getting foggy
down there?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.662
Look down there.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.930
No, there is a fog.

17:45.932 --> 17:49.434
There's a fog down there
now all of a sudden.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.668
Right there, fog.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.936
There is fog there.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.871
Fog in that corner
back there.
There is.

17:53.873 --> 17:57.175
As we maneuver the boat
into the fog,

17:57.177 --> 18:00.912
the camera audio
captures a strange sound...

18:00.914 --> 18:03.581
[ rumbling ]

18:03.583 --> 18:07.151
...And inexplicably
shuts off yet again.

18:07.153 --> 18:10.088
I have never seen a gopro
stop recording by itself.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.256
This is the first time
this has happened.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.825
What is happening
right now...

18:13.827 --> 18:18.496
We are unable to explain
what is going on in this moment.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.932
That is the second time
that something has stopped

18:20.934 --> 18:22.166
recording
on this gopro camera.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.801
Can you please tell me
how much battery

18:23.803 --> 18:25.870
out of 100%
we have right now?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.805
What?
What is it?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.774
17% or something.
17%?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.742
15%.
15%.

18:31.744 --> 18:36.113
Extreme and abrupt temperature
changes, a sudden foggy mass,

18:36.115 --> 18:40.885
and major battery drainage are
usually experiences associated

18:40.887 --> 18:43.788
with an entity being
in close proximity.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.625
We still don't know if this
entity is the ohlone woman,

18:47.627 --> 18:51.562
but we can confidently surmise
that whoever she is,

18:51.564 --> 18:55.032
she is powerful and present.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.568
You didn't like us going down
there with the boat, did you?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.770
Did something happen to you
when you were alive?

18:59.772 --> 19:01.405
Are you the lady
in white?

19:05.411 --> 19:10.481
♪♪

19:10.483 --> 19:12.016
okay, this is it.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.819
We're getting ready to start our
investigation of albion castle

19:14.821 --> 19:16.888
in san francisco, california.

19:16.890 --> 19:20.858
What we want to do
is try to document evidence

19:20.860 --> 19:24.228
of this widely
seen female apparition

19:24.230 --> 19:28.266
of a woman who seems very
protective of the water caverns

19:28.268 --> 19:31.135
down below underground
in the tunnels.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.772
Now, this natural water spring
was very sacred

19:34.774 --> 19:36.607
to the native americans

19:36.609 --> 19:39.343
that were here
for over 10,000 years.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.113
There are also nearby
shell mounds

19:42.115 --> 19:45.383
or burial mounds
of the ohlone tribe,

19:45.385 --> 19:46.684
so we may be dealing

19:46.686 --> 19:50.188
with an apparition
of a native american woman.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.990
We don't know why,
but it's absolutely incredible

19:52.992 --> 19:56.494
how many people have seen
the same apparition.

19:56.496 --> 20:00.298
Before we head into the castle,
we will start our investigation

20:00.300 --> 20:02.767
down in the underground
water caverns.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.342
hello?

20:11.344 --> 20:15.880
♪♪

20:15.882 --> 20:17.682
as we reach the water caverns

20:17.684 --> 20:20.885
where the apparition of this
woman has been seen swimming

20:20.887 --> 20:25.056
and becoming very aggressive
if anyone goes into the water,

20:25.058 --> 20:27.525
I decide to conduct
an experiment.

20:27.527 --> 20:31.495
Okay, so, what I did is, I got
a high-powered laser beam

20:31.497 --> 20:34.432
and I laid it perfectly level
with the waterline

20:34.434 --> 20:37.468
all the way
to the back of the cavern.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.972
So, this laser is about
this high off

20:40.974 --> 20:43.774
the water the whole way.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.544
You could see the reflection
of the laser in the water

20:46.546 --> 20:48.913
and the laser
going over the water.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.648
So, I want to see
if that laser beam

20:50.650 --> 20:52.450
will have any type of reaction,

20:52.452 --> 20:55.620
if there's any portal here,
if there's any spirit here.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.222
