52:18.219 --> 52:21.305
Well, I'm here now, son.

52:24.016 --> 52:26.519
Hey, actually, I gotta dip.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.479
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

52:28.646 --> 52:29.939
-I got a date.
-[JP] Uh-oh.

52:30.106 --> 52:31.816
Gotta get freshened up,
you know what I mean?

52:31.983 --> 52:33.734
Gotta make sure I'm looking
right for shorty.

52:33.901 --> 52:35.528

-[JP] Hey.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.363
Have a good time.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.198
[D-Mac] Hey, thanks, Pops.

52:39.365 --> 52:42.410
I appreciate this.

52:42.577 --> 52:44.579
This'll come in handy.

52:44.745 --> 52:46.998
[JP] Have a good time.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.043
[Jenny] Your instincts
are correct.

52:51.210 --> 52:52.628
-You should be concerned.
-How bad is it?

52:52.795 --> 52:54.171
A taskforce has been assembled,

52:54.338 --> 52:56.299
and CBI is at the top
of their target list.

52:56.465 --> 52:58.467
Well, how they get
on me so fast?

52:58.634 --> 52:59.927
That's all I know, and I
burned a favor to get that.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.054
You need to keep
your hands clean.

53:02.221 --> 53:04.473
Let the others
do the dirty work,

53:04.640 --> 53:07.935
and it wouldn't hurt to have
a friend in the CPD.

53:08.102 --> 53:09.520
Stay ahead of things.

is this funky little two-step.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.803
Okay. Now, it's time for me
to teach you something.

53:42.970 --> 53:45.014

that I gotta handle.

Is it your family?

54:35.314 --> 54:37.441
No.

54:38.651 --> 54:41.946
Go. I understand.

54:49.161 --> 54:51.205
I'm gonna make this up to you.

54:51.372 --> 54:52.915
Okay.

54:55.543 --> 54:57.962

to look forward to.

when this shit ends,

55:25.072 --> 55:26.741

We here to negotiate.

dealers or people I don't know.

our business tonight.

the cops know about us.

ever work for you?

now, burn this place down,
