Meredith:
"I needed more time."

00:06.380 --> 00:08.790
I can't tell you how often
I've heard surgeons say this

00:08.790 --> 00:09.960
after losing a patient.

Oh, damn it.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.710
They're moving Suzanne
to the CCU.

00:21.710 --> 00:24.580
She's spiking fevers again.
She's got chest pain.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.380
It just
doesn't make any sense.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.960
I know. I just hope
Dr. Riley can help.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.710
Who's that?

00:30.710 --> 00:33.960
You know, the -- the doctor
from San Francisco I'm bringing.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.380
UCSF?
I didn't tell you?

00:35.380 --> 00:37.500
No, but we didn't do
much talking last night.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.920
She's supposed to be
this diagnostic genius,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.580
and I might have used your name
to lure her here.

00:42.580 --> 00:44.620
Ooh, resourceful.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.580
Look, at some point, we probably
should talk about this.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.580
We will, but you should go
save Suzanne's life first.

00:50.830 --> 00:53.290
We think in time,
we talk in time --

00:53.290 --> 00:56.080
Doses per day.
Life expectancy.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.790
Take two
and call me in the morning.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.540
Good morning.
Is it?

00:59.540 --> 01:00.960
Aww.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.210
Mwah.
Mwah.

01:04.380 --> 01:06.170
Okay, come on,
come back to bed with me.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.790
No, I wish.

01:07.790 --> 01:10.330
I have to go check up
on that foster kid you
brought in last night.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.880
Joey, yeah.
How's he doing?

01:11.880 --> 01:13.380
That's what
I need to find out.

01:13.380 --> 01:14.540
He doesn't even know

01:14.540 --> 01:16.750
that his brothers and sister
were taken away.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.750
Who has to tell him?

01:18.750 --> 01:20.250
You're looking at her.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.380
I'm sorry.
No,
I'm sorry.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.420
You asked me to try
to keep them together.

01:24.420 --> 01:26.380
Miranda, we both know that
even the chief of surgery

01:26.380 --> 01:28.120
has no power over
Social Services.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.790
Mwah.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.880
Keep me posted.
I will.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.040
-I love you.
-Mm-hmm.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.620
Don't sleep all day.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.380
You always tell me
not to let you sleep all day,

01:35.380 --> 01:37.670
and then
you sleep all day.
Mm-hmm.

01:37.670 --> 01:40.790
And what is a heartbeat
if not a ticking clock?

01:40.790 --> 01:43.000
I'm gonna sleep all day.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.960
A clock
that's always counting down.
Whoa!

01:45.960 --> 01:48.170
Hey,
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.420
Kids were sick again.

01:49.420 --> 01:52.000
Um...what's going on?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.830
Pac-North's been purchased.

01:53.830 --> 01:55.290
By the Fox Foundation.

01:55.290 --> 01:57.000
That's --

01:58.120 --> 01:59.830
What, really?

01:59.830 --> 02:01.580
How? Why?

02:01.580 --> 02:05.250
Well, you see, Catherine and I
got into a fight, and now...

02:05.250 --> 02:06.290
And...?

02:06.290 --> 02:08.790
And now we have to
report to Grey-Sloan

02:08.790 --> 02:10.960
and interview
to keep our jobs.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.790
An interview with --

02:12.790 --> 02:13.960
Don't say Tom Koracick.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.250
Tom Koracick.
Ah...

02:19.250 --> 02:21.290
Richard,
how big was this fight?

02:21.290 --> 02:23.330
It was pretty big.

02:23.330 --> 02:24.710
Does Karev know?

02:24.710 --> 02:27.620
Eh, well, he's dealing with
family issues in Iowa.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.710
I call him and tell him
the place was gonna close,

02:29.710 --> 02:31.620
and he texts me

02:31.620 --> 02:33.920
a "laugh until you cry" emoji
with a party hat.

02:35.170 --> 02:37.120
Hey, guys,
happy first day!

02:37.120 --> 02:39.920
-Hm.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.830
What?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.500
Ooh, I'm nervous!

02:45.500 --> 02:49.750
Like it's the first day
of school or something.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.460
Wish I had one more day
in your bed.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.500
But I guess you don't.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.540
Aren't you getting sick
of staying at my place?

02:59.540 --> 03:02.580
I mean, there's no room
to put your stuff.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.460
But, like,
we could find room.

03:06.460 --> 03:08.460
No, yeah,
hypothetically,

03:08.460 --> 03:11.420
but we're not at
the cohabitating step, right?

03:12.920 --> 03:14.080
Thank you.
Right.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.790
I mean, look,
you'll love your own place.

03:16.790 --> 03:21.000
You just gotta,
you know, find one.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.380
Woman on P.A.: Dr. Dees --
Dr. Dillon Dees to ICU.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.380
Lads, say hello
to Dr. Grey, please.

03:29.380 --> 03:30.290
Hey.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.120
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.580
There was a time
when they loved having a tour

03:35.580 --> 03:37.580
of whatever hospital it was
I was working in.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.330
Now they just want to know
where the cafeteria is.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.750
Is there
no school today?

03:40.750 --> 03:42.170
Parent-Teacher Conferences.
Oh.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.000
Come on,
come on, come on.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.120
Put it back.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.830
Did I see
a certain chief resident

03:47.830 --> 03:49.580
leave the house
this morning?

03:49.580 --> 03:50.580
Did you?

03:50.580 --> 03:51.880
Hmm,
that's interesting.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.040
So you're back together?

03:53.040 --> 03:54.880
I don't know.
Why are you so interested?

03:54.880 --> 03:57.210
Hmm, I'm anxious,
and I deflect when I'm anxious.

03:57.210 --> 03:59.620
Also I'm looking for examples
of love enduring hardships.

04:01.210 --> 04:03.210
Well, I wouldn't go
that far yet.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.620
But the sex is great.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.210
Does that count?

04:06.210 --> 04:08.420
Doesn't hurt.

04:11.290 --> 04:14.540
Don't worry,
Link's not with me.

04:14.540 --> 04:15.960
Why would I be --

04:15.960 --> 04:18.000
I know that you're getting the
paternity results back today,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.830
and I know
that you've been avoiding him

04:19.830 --> 04:21.500
ever since he said
that he wanted the test,

04:21.500 --> 04:23.420
and I know that you're not
happy about it, either,

04:23.420 --> 04:27.250
but Link may look like
a department store mannequin,

04:27.250 --> 04:30.040
but he is actually human,
and he gets to have feelings.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.380
He gets to be mad.
He gets to have doubts.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.790
He gets to be upset
that he got taken for a ride.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.500
It was not my intention
to take --

04:36.500 --> 04:38.790
Your intention
doesn't really matter here.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.790
What matters is
the reality of the situation,

04:40.790 --> 04:42.380
and when two people
love each other,

04:42.380 --> 04:44.830
they just need to be given
all of the information

04:44.830 --> 04:46.830
so that they can process it
and rise.

04:46.830 --> 04:50.380
Because if given the chance,
they will rise.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.040
Are you
going through something?

04:55.250 --> 04:59.170
Alex, uh,
hasn't been returning my calls.

04:59.170 --> 05:01.330
He says that
he's going through something,

05:01.330 --> 05:03.620
and he needs time,
and if I didn't know better,

05:03.620 --> 05:04.830
I would think
he was getting revenge

05:04.830 --> 05:06.460
for when
I needed time.

05:06.460 --> 05:09.420
But, um, I know he would
never do that, so...

05:09.420 --> 05:12.040
I'm sorry.
I'm anxious, and I --

05:12.040 --> 05:13.830
Deflect when
you're anxious.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.120
Me too.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.620
Link loves you.

05:17.620 --> 05:19.670
Stop avoiding him.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.710
So, who are you
bringing back?

05:22.710 --> 05:24.040
TBD.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.620
Don't act like
you haven't decided.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.670
It's not an act,
it's a managerial nightmare.

05:27.670 --> 05:30.000
I promise, I'll let you know
as soon as I've made a decision.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.540
What decision?

05:31.540 --> 05:34.830
Foundation's absorbing Pac-North
and its employees.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.250
Oh --
Yep.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.670
In that event, uh, I'd like to
make some recommendations.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.670
About the people
you impulsively fired

05:40.670 --> 05:43.040
to set in motion a chain
of events I'm still
trying to clear up?

05:43.040 --> 05:45.210
No, thank you, I'll conduct
the interviews myself,

05:45.210 --> 05:46.540
and make my decisions.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.460
And here I thought
you and I were making friends.

05:49.460 --> 05:52.250
You did?
That's so nice to hear.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.330
Causes of undulant fever
include brucellosis,

05:57.330 --> 06:00.880
babesiosis, typhoid,
leptospirosis...

06:00.880 --> 06:01.960
Slow down,
dude.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.750
Oh, good Lord, people.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.170
Just because you're injured
doesn't mean you can't shower.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.170
Dr. DeLuca said
we could only eat and sleep.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.790
Bailey:
Hey, what you got?

06:11.790 --> 06:14.250
Blood cultures and ELISA came
back negative for all of that,

06:14.250 --> 06:15.880
and her lymph node biopsy's
clear as well.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.670
Which means no lymphoma.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.120
Right.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.250
Isn't no lymphoma
a good thing?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.830
I don't want
to walk back there

06:23.830 --> 06:25.250
and tell them
that I have nothing.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.790
Well, then, figure it out,
and you won't have to.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.210
Burn!

06:28.210 --> 06:30.000
Be part of
the solution, Helm.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
And, Simms,
take a shower.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.210
Suzanne:
Matty's 13!

06:34.210 --> 06:36.290
I should have years before
she's in the kissing stage.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.080
What about Scott Thompson?
Well,
that was different.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.960
He gave me
a Styx record.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.210
Well, maybe Taylor
gave Matty something.

06:42.210 --> 06:44.210
Wait --
Matty kissed Taylor?
Yeah.

06:44.210 --> 06:45.580
Taylor Olson?
Yeah.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.120
DeLuca:
Good morning, Hadley.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.380
Suzanne,
how are you feeling?

06:50.420 --> 06:52.750
She's been
digging up dirt on you.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.380
It's called research.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.620
I didn't exactly have to do
a lot of digging.

06:56.620 --> 06:57.620
Hospital Hell.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.460
Did you see
that article?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.830
That piece was intended
to highlight weaknesses

07:01.830 --> 07:03.040
within the entire
health care system,

07:03.040 --> 07:04.460
and the surgeon
who wrote it

07:04.460 --> 07:06.460
actually recently
came back to work here.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.170
You're --
You're not gonna find better,

07:08.170 --> 07:09.830
more competent care
in the whole Northwest.

07:12.420 --> 07:14.830
Um...

07:14.830 --> 07:17.000
Can I help you?

07:18.750 --> 07:20.790
Excuse me?

07:24.830 --> 07:27.790
Interpreter:
I'm Dr. Lauren Riley.
Right.

07:27.790 --> 07:31.620
I'm here for a consult
with Dr. Meredith Grey.

07:31.620 --> 07:34.580
It's nice to meet you,
Ms. Britland.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.250
Suzanne.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.750
And you are --

07:38.750 --> 07:41.620
She is our
master diagnostician.
Oh, thank God.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.380
I'm going to ask
about a billion questions

07:44.380 --> 07:46.080
and run even more tests.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.620
I will annoy you greatly,

07:47.620 --> 07:49.880
but in the end,
it will be worth it, okay?

07:49.880 --> 07:52.170
I like you already.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.670
I want a full autoimmune panel,

07:56.670 --> 08:01.040
a pericardial fluid culture,
and a cytology.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.620
Immediately!

08:02.620 --> 08:04.750
We -- We already
did those.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.710
Do them again.

08:05.710 --> 08:08.250
And page cardio.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.420
I need to know
why the fluid is building up,

08:11.420 --> 08:13.920
because it will happen again.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.540
And can you tell Dr. Grey
I'm here already?

08:18.620 --> 08:20.620
Wow.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.500
The competence is just slapping
me in the face right now.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.960
Okay.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.750
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Picado, 4622.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.580
Dr. London Picado,
extension 4622.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.750
Okay, folks.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.960
A-As you can see, I've got
a lot of interviewing to do.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.210
I'll be as efficient
as possible,

08:37.210 --> 08:38.830
but thank you
for your patience.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.620
Chief Karev is on
personal leave,

08:40.620 --> 08:42.210
so I've been acting
as interim and --

08:42.210 --> 08:43.380
Cool story, bro.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.580
Okay, then, first up,
Dr. Webber. Yeah.

08:48.580 --> 08:52.750
You'll be happy to hear, uh,
Dr. Fox was, uh, very clear.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.040
Your job is safe.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.460
What's that
supposed to mean?

08:58.460 --> 09:00.170
Your wife wants you here
at Grey-Sloan, big guy.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.710
She wants you here enough
to buy a craptastic hospital

09:02.710 --> 09:04.580
and pretend it's
an investment.

09:04.580 --> 09:05.580
No.

09:05.580 --> 09:07.040
No?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.500
No,
I thought I could do this,

09:08.500 --> 09:11.620
because I miss Grey-Sloan,
because I miss Bailey

09:11.620 --> 09:15.880
and -- and Meredith,
and -- and Bokhee and OR 2.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.880
God,
how I miss OR 2.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.830
But if Catherine thinks she can
just move me where she wants

09:20.830 --> 09:24.000
like she's playing chess
and I'm some pawn --

09:24.000 --> 09:25.250
You're not a pawn.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.380
A rook at least.
Maybe a knight.

09:27.380 --> 09:29.380
You tell Dr. Fox
she can go to hell.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.790
Look,
I -- I take it back.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.460
You are her queen!

09:32.460 --> 09:33.460
Well, checkmate!

09:46.960 --> 09:49.540
You don't look old enough
to be a doctor.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.620
Well, I don't always feel
old enough to be a doctor, so...

09:52.920 --> 09:54.120
When did
the pain start?

09:54.120 --> 09:56.210
Well, I first
heard her gasp

09:56.210 --> 09:59.210
about 20 minutes
out of Tacoma.

09:59.210 --> 10:00.620
We came here to attend

10:00.620 --> 10:03.830
the Seattle
Ballroom Championship.

10:03.830 --> 10:07.620
We won first place five years
in a row back in our prime.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.120
Can I check
your abdomen?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.170
Sure.

10:14.620 --> 10:16.040
Oh...

10:16.040 --> 10:18.830
You should probably know
she has cancer.

10:18.830 --> 10:20.920
Stage IV colorectal.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.960
Didn't respond to chemo...

10:22.960 --> 10:25.670
So we're living
our best life.
Mm.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.460
Wow, okay, Irene,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.120
I think you may have
an intestinal obstruction.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.830
I'm going to admit you.

10:31.830 --> 10:34.250
I'll have to get a CT
and a few tests.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.210
Do you think
we'll be out in time

10:36.210 --> 10:37.620
to go
to the waltz showcase?

10:37.620 --> 10:40.210
We'll cut the line
if we have to.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.880
Maggie: My success rates
far outnumber

10:43.880 --> 10:46.000
both national
and international averages.

10:47.460 --> 10:50.250
And, um, if you weigh
my outcomes against

10:50.250 --> 10:52.250
only the top programs
in the country,

10:52.250 --> 10:54.420
you'll find
that I still outperform --

10:54.420 --> 10:56.120
Um...
Are you gonna get that?

10:56.120 --> 10:58.330
I'm sure it can wait.
As I was saying --

10:58.330 --> 11:01.290
I'm sorry, I'm being --
I'm being paged.

11:01.290 --> 11:03.040
I don't understand.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.620
Catherine had me re-instate
your privileges last night.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.920
But I had to bring you in here
to, uh, kill some time

11:07.920 --> 11:09.170
so folks out there
wouldn't feel

11:09.170 --> 11:10.460
you were being shown
favoritism.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.830
Which you most certainly are.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.210
Well,
thank you so much.

11:14.210 --> 11:15.880
Don't thank me,
thank Altman.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.040
She was gracious enough

11:17.040 --> 11:18.960
to allow you back
into her department.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.120
It's my department.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.790
It was,
then you ghosted us.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.880
Dr. Altman has had
years of experience

11:23.880 --> 11:25.210
running cardio floors.

11:26.540 --> 11:29.620
So, she's home
with two sick kids today,

11:29.620 --> 11:33.420
so, uh, just make sure you
keep her posted on your service.

11:33.420 --> 11:34.620
Okay.

11:34.620 --> 11:36.080
Yeah.

11:36.080 --> 11:39.920
And, uh, don't keep
your patient waiting.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.120
Yeah.

11:44.290 --> 11:45.670
Where are they?

11:45.670 --> 11:47.460
I told you,
I don't know,

11:47.460 --> 11:50.380
but I need you to stay still
while I finish this exam.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.250
Joey?
Hi, I'm Dr. Bailey.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.500
I was here last night
when you came in.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.250
Do you know where
my brothers and sister are?

11:56.250 --> 11:57.380
I --

11:57.380 --> 11:59.460
Um, are you
almost finished here, Dr. Kim?

12:00.750 --> 12:02.330
Pulse is weaker.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.290
We're gonna need
a CT angio

12:04.290 --> 12:06.170
and another chest X-ray,
please.

12:06.170 --> 12:08.420
Woman:
Right away, Doctor.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.500
Where are they?
Are they okay?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.210
Tell me, please!
Joey --

12:12.210 --> 12:14.250
Joey,
your siblings were here

12:14.250 --> 12:16.210
when you came in
last night.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.330
Um...

12:17.330 --> 12:20.460
They waited as long
as they could, but...

12:20.460 --> 12:22.290
You reported them.
I'm sorry.

12:22.290 --> 12:24.380
I'm legally obligated
when the kids --

12:24.380 --> 12:25.420
To what?

12:25.420 --> 12:26.830
Tear apart
the only family I have?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.080
They're with
social workers.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.170
You broke them up?
They aren't even together?

12:30.170 --> 12:33.670
I honestly don't know,
but, no, they're safe.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.330
Right, 'cause everyone knows
the foster system is so safe.

12:37.330 --> 12:41.420
Uh, Dr. Kim has ordered
some more tests,

12:41.420 --> 12:42.920
so let's
get those done.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.210
In the meantime,
I will call Social Services

12:45.210 --> 12:47.920
and find out
what I can, okay?

12:51.170 --> 12:52.790
Suzanne,
try to keep still for me, okay?

12:52.790 --> 12:55.540
Suzanne: Okay.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.830
So, you lost 25 pounds
two years ago?

12:58.830 --> 13:00.420
Were you dieting?

13:00.420 --> 13:02.920
I had a 6-year-old
and an 11-year-old

13:02.920 --> 13:05.670
who were maniacs
and never let me sit down.

13:05.670 --> 13:07.120
Is that a diet?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.420
And you never
gained the weight back?

13:10.420 --> 13:13.580
No, and I was more than happy
to throw out the mom jeans.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.670
DeLuca: Dr. Pierce,
what do you see?

13:17.670 --> 13:19.380
That's not a good face.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.710
There's too much fluid.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.330
I need to do
a pericardial window.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.830
Okay,
I need the dummy words.

13:23.830 --> 13:26.250
It is a procedure in which
I make a small hole

13:26.250 --> 13:27.420
in the membrane
around your heart

13:27.420 --> 13:28.920
to prevent fluid
from accumulating.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.290
Hadley:
This is ridiculous.

13:30.290 --> 13:32.080
Suzanne, they want
to cut into you again?

13:32.080 --> 13:34.620
If we're starting over,
then we might as well
do it someplace else.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.540
We are not starting over.

13:36.830 --> 13:38.040
Yes, we are.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.920
I approach my patients

13:39.920 --> 13:42.250
as if I'm meeting them on their
first day in the hospital.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.540
You'd be amazed at what can
slip through the cracks.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.170
They don't even agree
on what they're doing.

13:46.170 --> 13:48.250
I'm too tired to move,
anyway.

13:48.250 --> 13:51.210
Plus, my kids really like the
mac and cheese in the cafeteria.

13:51.210 --> 13:53.290
This isn't funny.
Hadley,
they're trying.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.040
Let them.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.960
DeLuca: Thank you.
We'll be back to prep you soon.

14:02.380 --> 14:03.830
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Clark to the ICU.

14:03.830 --> 14:05.750
Dr. Annabelle Clark
to the ICU.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.420
Where is Dr. Grey?

14:07.420 --> 14:09.790
Uh, she's in surgery
right now.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.210
She's right there.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.000
I'll go book an OR.

14:15.830 --> 14:17.380
Dr. Grey?

14:17.380 --> 14:19.250
Dr. Lauren Riley.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.920
It's good
to finally meet you.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.170
Oh, my consult
from UCLA.

14:24.170 --> 14:25.170
SF. UCSF.

14:27.080 --> 14:31.000
Suzanne Britland
isn't your patient, is she?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.120
I have consulted
on her case.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.620
Um,
and I'm at a loss.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.790
And I've heard
great things about you.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.210
It was great
to meet you.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.670
If you'll excuse me,
I'm being paged.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.040
You lied to me.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.330
I prefer
the word "lured."

14:52.330 --> 14:53.920
I prefer
the word "leaving."

14:53.920 --> 14:55.580
Okay, uh,
Dr. Riley, look, please,

14:55.580 --> 14:57.790
i-if you leave now
without cracking this case,

14:57.790 --> 14:59.120
it's gonna
drive you crazy.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.250
It'll keep you up
at night.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.580
It's too rare,
we're too lost,

15:01.580 --> 15:04.670
and you're too good
to just walk away.

15:13.540 --> 15:14.960
Okay.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.420
Uh...You.
What's your job?

15:17.420 --> 15:19.250
Mabel Tseng.
Second year resident.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.380
That's great.
Uh, uh, come on in.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.710
Tom, a word.

15:22.710 --> 15:25.250
Please, um, patience, Hunt.
Just, uh, patience.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.420
Yeah, um, listen, it's just,
you know,

15:27.420 --> 15:29.420
you've interviewed
all the attendings but me,

15:29.420 --> 15:31.290
and now you're interviewing
the residents.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.670
And it just
seems a little bit like

15:32.670 --> 15:33.830
it's some kind of
a game, Tom.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.040
Don't worry,
I'll have you out of here

15:35.040 --> 15:36.040
in time
for your wedding.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.500
When is it, again?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.120
I -- I -- I can't --

15:39.120 --> 15:40.790
Uh, Dr. Tseng,
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

15:40.790 --> 15:42.330
-Yeah. Right this way.
-Thanks.

15:42.330 --> 15:44.540
Yeah. There we go.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.500
Woman on P.A.: Dr. Willem --
Dr. Harrison Willem...

15:49.500 --> 15:51.750
Hi.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.540
Are you lost?

15:53.540 --> 15:54.880
Uh...

15:54.880 --> 15:56.580
Do you know
how to get to the exit?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.670
The nurse said
I could get some fresh air.

15:58.670 --> 16:00.330
Oh.
Which nurse?

16:00.330 --> 16:01.670
Nurse Jones?

16:01.670 --> 16:02.920
Good guess.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.420
I would've gone with that
or Smith.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.920
Let's go.
What?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.460
No. Where?
Back to your room.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.500
Your unbandaged wounds
gave you away.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.670
So you don't need
to worry.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.880
They said
it wouldn't take long.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.040
That's right, we'll have your
mom out in less than an hour.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.120
Where's Hadley?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.670
She and Mei Li
went to go get Grandma.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.540
She had too much wine
at the sports bar again.

16:26.880 --> 16:32.040
Sweetie, I think that maybe
you and I should talk about

16:32.040 --> 16:33.500
what happened
on the field trip,

16:33.500 --> 16:34.750
with you and Taylor.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.250
Hadley told you?!
She swore she wouldn't.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.830
Honey, why would you want
to talk to Aunt Hadley about it

16:39.830 --> 16:41.120
and not me?

16:41.120 --> 16:43.290
The principal only told her
because you weren't there.

16:43.290 --> 16:45.290
I don't want
to talk to anyone!

16:45.290 --> 16:46.330
Matty, wait!

16:46.330 --> 16:49.540
She only
started doing that

16:49.540 --> 16:51.540
when she realized I couldn't
physically follow her.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.210
Never have children.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.380
Hey.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.580
Well,
I'm happy you called.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.670
The, uh...

17:07.670 --> 17:09.500
Are the results back?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.580
No.
Uh, no, not yet.

17:11.580 --> 17:12.830
Um, tonight.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.420
I'm...anxious.

17:14.420 --> 17:15.540
Got it.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.210
What's gonna happen?

17:17.210 --> 17:19.120
We meet back here
at 7:00,

17:19.120 --> 17:21.250
we look
at a piece of paper

17:21.250 --> 17:25.170
that spells out
the baby's biological paternity.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.580
What's gonna happen then?

17:26.580 --> 17:28.000
I don't know.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Okay.

17:33.790 --> 17:37.330
But, um,
could you try to know?

17:37.330 --> 17:38.790
What happens with us

17:38.790 --> 17:40.880
if we find out
that it's Owen's?

17:42.460 --> 17:45.000
You said
that you loved me.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.250
Was that true?

17:47.250 --> 17:51.080
Do you want
to be with me, Link?

17:51.080 --> 17:55.380
Do you want to be
in this baby's life?

17:57.830 --> 18:02.000
You and Owen
have a complicated history.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.750
I mean, you left him
when you found out

18:06.750 --> 18:08.790
that Teddy was pregnant
with his baby

18:08.790 --> 18:11.210
because you knew how much
it would matter to him.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.620
So it's crazy to me
to think that

18:13.620 --> 18:16.000
that history
won't shape your future

18:16.000 --> 18:17.420
if Owen's the father.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.790
And my future.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.790
I love you, Amelia.

18:21.790 --> 18:24.830
I do.
And I...

18:24.830 --> 18:27.210
I need to know.

18:27.210 --> 18:29.670
Okay.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.170
You hear that?

18:37.170 --> 18:39.040
That's your blood flow.
That's good.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.080
That's bad.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.250
If you leave here now,

18:45.250 --> 18:48.040
best-case scenario,
we amputate your arm.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.620
Worst-case scenario,
you die.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.620
Bailey: Karev?

18:50.620 --> 18:52.290
I caught him
trying to leave,

18:52.290 --> 18:54.420
thought I would tell him
what would happen if he did.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.500
Joey,
I spoke to Social Services,

18:56.500 --> 18:58.710
and they told me
they do everything they can

18:58.710 --> 19:00.500
to keep siblings together,
so --

19:00.500 --> 19:02.000
But we aren't related.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.080
So, no, they won't.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.620
We were all
in a foster home together,

19:05.620 --> 19:08.330
and -- and things got real bad,
so we ran away.

19:08.330 --> 19:10.540
I made a promise
that we would never split up.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.710
I know you don't get it,
but I have to go.

19:12.710 --> 19:15.750
I lived in 12 foster homes
in 5 years.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.420
For a few months,

19:17.420 --> 19:20.420
I had these foster siblings
that I really loved.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.290
When we got separated,
we came up with a system.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.210
On Wednesday nights
at 7:00,

19:25.210 --> 19:26.880
I would call
their foster home,

19:26.880 --> 19:30.080
let the phone ring once,
and then hang up.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.620
On Mondays,
they would do the same for me.

19:32.620 --> 19:35.210
And then
I got moved again, so...

19:35.210 --> 19:38.540
Joey,
I do understand.

19:38.540 --> 19:40.830
They're little.

19:40.830 --> 19:42.830
And they're scared.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.620
And we were never
supposed to be separated.

19:45.620 --> 19:47.080
They're my family.
I know.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.500
But you can't help them
if you're dead, right?

19:59.170 --> 20:02.420
Oh, I guess Koracick gave
at least one person a job.

20:02.420 --> 20:04.710
As not chief
of my department.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.290
How's Richard doing?

20:08.290 --> 20:10.960
Not great.
How's Catherine?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.830
Mourning in
her typical way --

20:12.830 --> 20:15.460
traveling and buying
a bunch of extravagant stuff.

20:16.750 --> 20:17.880
When we broke up,

20:17.880 --> 20:20.120
I went online
and bought a pair of jeans.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.540
Catherine went to Paris
and bought a hospital.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.460
Do you think
there's any saving them?

20:31.120 --> 20:33.620
I really don't know.

20:33.620 --> 20:35.080
I hope so.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.580
Hayes: Dr. Grey?

20:38.580 --> 20:41.380
You haven't seen my boys
by any chance, have you?

20:41.380 --> 20:42.460
Um, no.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.580
Are they hiding,
or just maybe wandering?

20:44.580 --> 20:46.460
They're just trying
to torture me

20:46.460 --> 20:48.210
and make sure we're late
for the conference, you know?

20:49.210 --> 20:51.170
Sometimes I think
I hate them.

20:51.170 --> 20:53.210
No, I mean,
I don't, obviously.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.210
Maybe I do.

20:54.210 --> 20:56.120
Oh, I don't know
how you do it --

20:56.120 --> 20:58.040
the kids, the job,
stay sane.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.500
Who says I'm sane?

20:59.500 --> 21:00.830
The city
shut off my water once

21:00.830 --> 21:02.380
because I forgot
to pay the bill,

21:02.380 --> 21:03.620
and I didn't even notice.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.790
My daughter
had to tell me.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.580
Dr. Grey?

21:06.580 --> 21:08.420
I'll, uh...

21:08.420 --> 21:09.290
I'll leave you to it.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.000
This is bad.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.880
It's --
It's bad, right?

21:17.420 --> 21:20.540
Meredith: Ooh,
that's a lot of mets, Schmitt.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.380
You pulled up the wrong year,
honey.

21:32.380 --> 21:33.920
It's 1983.
No,
just wait for it.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.210
Wait for it.
Not '82.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.710
No, hey, here. Yeah.

21:37.710 --> 21:41.250
Grapevine underarm turn,
right forward across,

21:41.250 --> 21:44.250
and that's the moment we won
right there.

21:44.250 --> 21:47.000
Immaculate.
You were immaculate.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.500
Always were.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.620
We love the Internet.

21:50.620 --> 21:53.290
Get to watch ourselves
all over again.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.210
Most people hate it
for that very same reason.

21:56.210 --> 21:57.830
Oh.

21:57.830 --> 21:59.170
Irene,
this is Dr. Grey.

21:59.170 --> 22:01.210
Hi.
Have you been having
shortness of breath?

22:01.210 --> 22:03.460
Because your lungs,
uh...

22:03.460 --> 22:05.250
You said it was
a bowel obstruction,

22:05.250 --> 22:06.880
so why are we
talking about lungs?

22:06.880 --> 22:07.920
I'm sorry, it's...

22:09.710 --> 22:13.670
Meredith: A bowel obstruction
is causing your pain, Irene,

22:13.670 --> 22:16.830
but the cancer is --
is in your liver and your lungs,

22:16.830 --> 22:21.040
and it -- it has spread
throughout your body.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.830
B-But...

22:22.830 --> 22:26.210
Can you operate on --
on...anything?

22:26.210 --> 22:28.710
With this degree
of metastasis,

22:28.710 --> 22:31.460
your immune system
is severely compromised,

22:31.460 --> 22:33.960
and I'm just not sure you would
recover from a surgery.

when he was 5.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.120
No relatives
came forward,

He's a good kid.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.210

24:10.880 --> 24:13.330
My sister thinks
that Taylor is a boy,

but my daughter Matty
was kissing a girl at school.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.330

Norman, hi.

25:17.380 --> 25:18.540
I'm paging
the palliative care department.

25:18.540 --> 25:19.750
I understand.

25:19.750 --> 25:22.580
But before you do that,
I -- I wondered...

25:22.580 --> 25:23.880
Yeah?

25:26.250 --> 25:28.540
You remind me
of my grandson.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.210
You want me
to call him?
No, no.

25:30.210 --> 25:31.670
He's all the way back
in Baltimore, but...

25:31.670 --> 25:34.620
you are kind.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.170
And gentle.

25:36.170 --> 25:38.380
Just like him.

25:38.380 --> 25:41.040
And that made me think
that maybe I could ask

25:41.040 --> 25:45.250
if you could do a sad old man
a very big favor.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.960
Literally anything.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.250
Did you identify
the phrenic nerve?

25:52.250 --> 25:54.080
Yep.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.830
Okay, and you have good
mobilization of the
pulmonary ligament?

25:56.830 --> 25:58.960
Ooh,
decompression is good.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.580
Did someone ask you
to babysit me?

26:00.580 --> 26:02.580
You have double-checked me
on every step.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.460
Was it Koracick?
Wasn't anyone.

26:04.460 --> 26:05.750
I'm just
really worried about Suzanne.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.580
Did you listen to her
when we were putting her under?

26:07.580 --> 26:09.420
She's not here
for my feelings --

26:09.420 --> 26:12.380
she's here for my hands
and my expertise,

26:12.380 --> 26:13.830
and that is my focus,

26:13.830 --> 26:16.120
and it should be yours,
too.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.790
Surgery was smooth?

26:27.790 --> 26:28.960
Yes.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.000
Good.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.250
Okay, when she wakes up,

26:32.250 --> 26:34.040
we need to withdraw
all treatment.

26:34.040 --> 26:38.830
All antibiotics,
all antifungals, and steroids.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.000
All: What?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.830
Why would we
do that?

26:43.120 --> 26:46.380
We've already tested
for infectious diseases,

26:46.380 --> 26:49.040
malignancies,
and autoimmune disorders,

26:49.040 --> 26:52.040
and now we're at the point
where we have to consider

26:52.040 --> 26:55.120
there's some clue that's being
suppressed by the medication.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.540
We need it to present itself.

26:56.540 --> 26:57.540
Dr. Riley --

26:58.830 --> 27:00.580
Suzanne needs
those antibiotics

27:00.580 --> 27:03.540
to treat a form of infection
that we can't find.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.250
And the steroids
to treat her pericarditis.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.670
If we do
what you're saying,

27:08.670 --> 27:11.080
she could go into septic shock
and be dead in days.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.460
I don't know, Maggie,
what do you think?

27:16.460 --> 27:19.210
I think it's reckless
and cavalier,

27:19.210 --> 27:21.170
and I believe
that you'd be making

27:21.170 --> 27:22.500
a catastrophic mistake.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.460
Make sure you follow up
on the path

27:24.460 --> 27:26.380

fluid analyses

27:26.380 --> 27:28.210
and, uh,
keep me posted.

27:29.830 --> 27:34.000

28:02.380 --> 28:03.880

all the rage seeping out of me

28:06.210 --> 28:08.790
might infect you
or trigger labor or something,

28:08.790 --> 28:10.120

28:18.580 --> 28:20.960
No, he made me wait all day,
then he made me interview.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.540
Now he's made me
wait out here again

with Catherine Fox.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.170

28:26.170 --> 28:27.830
Yeah.
Why?

28:27.830 --> 28:30.460
Because if
I give him just one reason

28:30.460 --> 28:32.380
not to give me a job here,
then he wins.

28:32.380 --> 28:34.380
He doesn't like me.
He doesn't want me around.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.120
You stole
his girlfriend.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.960
Hell yeah I did.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.290
You won.

28:42.290 --> 28:43.420
Hmm?

28:43.420 --> 28:46.250
You got the girl.
You got the family.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.170
You got
the whole Megillah.

28:48.170 --> 28:50.170
Just let Tom
have his fun.

28:50.170 --> 28:52.420
Or, you know,
his pain.

28:52.420 --> 28:56.210
'Cause that's
what it is.

28:56.210 --> 28:58.120
He's lonely.

28:58.120 --> 29:01.620
He's in pain.

29:01.620 --> 29:04.620
How do you do that?

29:04.620 --> 29:07.670
Do what?

29:07.670 --> 29:10.830
Feel everyone's feelings
so deeply all the time.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.080
It must be exhausting.

29:18.620 --> 29:20.960
It really is.
Hm.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.620
Norman.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.420
What did you do?

29:50.420 --> 29:53.620
Can you believe
Mr. Grant still fits?

29:53.620 --> 29:56.080
My tux.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.210
Irene Sholman, I'll never forget
the day we met.

29:59.210 --> 30:01.670
You were
across a dance floor,

30:01.670 --> 30:03.790
yelling at the judges
for docking you a quarter point.

30:05.040 --> 30:08.830
It was love
at first fight.

30:08.830 --> 30:13.620
How I got so lucky,
I'll never know.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.210
May I have this dance?

30:18.250 --> 30:20.420
I can
disconnect your oxygen.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.620
And whenever
you need to stop,

30:22.620 --> 30:24.670
I'll be right here,
okay?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.290
I don't have a gown.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.210
I look terrible.

30:39.040 --> 30:43.040

30:52.670 --> 30:54.670

been to a meeting.

32:22.460 --> 32:25.620
I didn't want to go home
to an empty house.

32:25.620 --> 32:29.670
I'm not sure where I work,
so...here I am.

32:29.670 --> 32:32.420
Come on,
you work here.

32:33.830 --> 32:35.250
Not by choice.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.420
I chose to work
at Pac-North,

32:37.420 --> 32:39.080
even though
I resented it.

32:39.080 --> 32:42.330
We were building a new program
from the ground up.

32:42.330 --> 32:44.830
And Catherine took
it all away

32:44.830 --> 32:48.420
with one phone call
to the bank.

32:50.420 --> 32:51.960
This'll pass,
you know.

32:53.250 --> 32:56.420
It feels bad now,
but soon enough,

32:56.420 --> 32:58.710
you guys will be
joking about this over coffee.

32:59.960 --> 33:05.040
Son, after Godzilla's done
stomping all over Tokyo,

33:05.040 --> 33:07.620
the mayor doesn't
take Godzilla to brunch.

33:07.620 --> 33:10.830
Okay, you are heartbroken,
so I'll forget the fact

33:10.830 --> 33:13.880
that you just compared my mother
to a giant lizard monster.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.210
Irene,
how are you feeling?

33:25.210 --> 33:26.620
Ohh...

33:26.620 --> 33:29.210
Any trouble breathing?
Any pain?

33:29.210 --> 33:32.000
I'm still floating,
dear.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.500
Is Norman --

33:34.500 --> 33:36.790
He's calling the kids.

33:36.790 --> 33:39.170
Don't be sad,
darling.

33:39.170 --> 33:41.080
Don't be sad.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.960
I've had
a beautiful life.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.790
And I'm ending it
with a beautiful partner.

33:49.540 --> 33:54.000
This life, it's just never
stopped surprising me.

that he has nowhere to go.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.330
I was him,
and Alex was him,

34:28.330 --> 34:30.210
and we turned out okay.

34:30.210 --> 34:32.790
It's not hopeless.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.380

34:49.000 --> 34:52.620
There was a time when
I would have made a dance floor

34:52.620 --> 34:54.330
for the dying old lady.

34:54.330 --> 34:55.830
What?

34:55.830 --> 34:58.420
Andrew and I broke up
the night of my trial,

34:58.420 --> 35:00.120
and there was a time
when that would've meant

35:00.120 --> 35:02.210
months of drama for me.

35:02.210 --> 35:05.210
But instead, I went home
and went to bed, and I woke up,

35:05.210 --> 35:07.420
and I was just excited
to go practice medicine.

35:07.420 --> 35:10.460
I used to be
a romantic.

35:10.460 --> 35:13.040
I would've been
the one

35:13.040 --> 35:15.250
to build the dance floor
in the cafeteria.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.790
And now you're leaving
the dance floors to the interns.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.830
You're not lacking in passion,
Grey, you're just...

35:23.830 --> 35:25.670
growing up a little.

35:27.290 --> 35:29.120
What would you do
if Ben dumped you?

35:29.120 --> 35:30.580
I'd burn him
to the ground.

35:30.580 --> 35:32.620
Hmm.

35:32.620 --> 35:34.210
Richard walked.

35:34.210 --> 35:35.420
What do you mean "walked"?

35:35.420 --> 35:36.580
I mean he left.

35:36.580 --> 35:38.040
He doesn't want to work
on Koracick's terms,

35:38.040 --> 35:40.080
and, honestly,
neither do I.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.830
Are we just gonna
let this happen?

35:41.830 --> 35:43.210
No!

35:43.210 --> 35:46.000
No, I'm not gonna
sit by helpless

35:46.000 --> 35:48.670
while my family
gets split apart again.

35:48.670 --> 35:51.420
You two,
come with me.

35:51.420 --> 35:53.710
Hadley:
Wait, what?

35:53.710 --> 35:55.830
You said
Dr. Riley never gives up.

35:55.830 --> 35:57.620
It --
I-It's not giving up.

35:57.620 --> 36:00.080
We will be monitoring you
the entire time.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.880
You want to take my sister
off all her medication --

36:01.880 --> 36:03.750
how is that
not giving up?!

36:03.750 --> 36:06.000
As symptoms arise,
we'll treat them.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.620
It's scary,
I know.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.750
You don't know
about anything!

36:09.750 --> 36:11.210
That article was right.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.040
This is
the hospital from hell.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.210
Please let me
transfer you.

36:15.210 --> 36:17.120
I will find you
a specialist.

36:18.790 --> 36:21.920
If I say yes,
what's going to happen?

36:21.920 --> 36:25.580
We will remove you
from all of your medication.

36:25.580 --> 36:30.040
And you will get sicker,
and you'll feel more pain.

36:31.540 --> 36:33.000
I know I'm asking you

36:33.000 --> 36:35.210
to make an incredibly
difficult decision,

36:35.210 --> 36:36.380
and I'm sorry.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.420
I have three sisters.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.750
The oldest one is my hero.

36:48.750 --> 36:51.880
The youngest one is my baby.

36:51.880 --> 36:56.620
I changed her diapers, and
I will never let her forget it.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.420
The middle one...

37:00.210 --> 37:03.460
...is my best friend.

37:03.460 --> 37:06.790
And if I were
in Suzanne's position,

37:06.790 --> 37:09.790
she's the one
who would decide for me,

37:09.790 --> 37:12.580
and that's why
I'm talking to you.

37:12.580 --> 37:16.830
Your sister's immune system
is too compromised

37:16.830 --> 37:18.790
for her to be moved safely.

37:18.790 --> 37:21.250
And even if we could move her,

37:21.250 --> 37:24.040
you're not going to find
anyone better than me.

37:24.040 --> 37:27.880
You may have noticed
that my ears don't work.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.620
But because of that,

37:29.620 --> 37:33.960
I have learned to listen
with my whole body.

37:33.960 --> 37:39.880
When the medications are gone,
the disease can start talking

37:39.880 --> 37:44.120
so I can figure out
what is wrong with your sister

37:44.120 --> 37:47.420
and hopefully,
we can save her life.

37:55.420 --> 37:57.500
You have my permission.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.540
Withdraw everything.

37:59.540 --> 38:01.250
Okay.

38:07.880 --> 38:11.040
Hey, uh, I --
I just wanted to say

38:11.040 --> 38:12.920
I also have a sister,
and that that was --

38:12.920 --> 38:15.710
I'm an only child.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.620
Oh, thanks for coming,
Tom.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.170
Close the door.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.040
Have a seat.

38:30.290 --> 38:31.920
You did
great work today, Tom.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.500
Jackson:
Such great work.

38:33.500 --> 38:37.250
But the board,
of which most of us are members,

38:37.250 --> 38:39.210
we've, uh,
come to a decision.

38:40.290 --> 38:42.540
We're all prepared
to quit.

38:44.830 --> 38:47.250
I'm sensing a "but."

38:47.250 --> 38:50.040
But Dr. Fox wouldn't really
like that.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.290
You know,
and as you said yourself,

38:52.290 --> 38:53.620
she wants me here.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.790
I mean, she wants
all of us here.
Mm.

38:55.790 --> 38:57.880
But, uh,
she will truly wonder

38:57.880 --> 39:00.250
why you didn't do
all you could

39:00.250 --> 39:02.290
to protect
her crown jewel hospital.

39:02.290 --> 39:04.420
I mean,
you've only just recovered

39:04.420 --> 39:07.040
from the
Hospital from Hell article.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.210
Meredith: We could blame me
for that,

39:08.210 --> 39:09.420
or we could just remember

39:09.420 --> 39:11.750
that I'm a Catherine Fox
Foundation award winner

39:11.750 --> 39:13.120
and a media darling,

39:13.120 --> 39:15.210
and, I mean,
you want me here.

39:15.210 --> 39:17.830
You can't afford to lose
all your best doctors.

39:17.830 --> 39:21.040
And truly,
your inability to see that

39:21.040 --> 39:24.210
could cause
Catherine Fox to question

39:24.210 --> 39:27.420
the whole
chief of chiefs title.

39:27.420 --> 39:29.170
And the salary.

39:29.170 --> 39:31.880
And the benefits.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.040
Name your terms.
We're a family.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.120
You have joined
our family,

39:40.120 --> 39:43.880
and some of us have come
to grudgingly respect you.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.750
But you do not get to rule
this family with an iron fist.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.620
Yeah, you don't get
to play all day,

39:48.620 --> 39:51.250
dangling our jobs over our heads
like a carrot.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.330
What -- I --

39:52.330 --> 39:54.330
Wait a minute.
I-I already did that.

39:54.330 --> 39:56.290
Hunt and Webber
get their jobs back.

39:56.290 --> 39:58.080
Pierce and Altman
become co-chiefs,

39:58.080 --> 40:00.250
and you find the money
to cover it.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.750
And Alex Karev and Hayes
can co-chief.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.040
Or we all quit.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.920
Richard: Agree to
our terms, Tom.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.250
And then
you get to just

40:10.250 --> 40:12.960
take all the credit
with Catherine.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.620
Meredith:
The heart beats until it can't.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.620
Our limbs move
until they don't.
