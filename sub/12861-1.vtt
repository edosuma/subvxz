02:27.120 --> 02:29.634
My name is Allison MacKenzie.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.637
Where I was born, time was told
not by the clock or the calendar...

02:34.800 --> 02:36.518
...but by the seasons.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.395
Summer was carefree contentment.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.432
Autumn was that bittersweet time
of regret...

02:43.600 --> 02:47.388
...for moments that had ended
and things that were yet undone.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.838
And then winter fell...

02:50.280 --> 02:53.192
...with a cold mantle
of caution and chill.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.318
It nipped our noses
and our arrogance...

02:56.720 --> 03:01.555
...and made use move closer to the
warm stoves of memory and desire.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.071
Spring was promise.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.352
But there was a fifth season...

03:06.520 --> 03:07.839
...of love...

03:08.200 --> 03:12.352
...and only the wise or the lucky ones
knew where to find it.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.228
Hey, mister,
which way to Peyton Place?

03:37.520 --> 03:41.115
Go up this road, about two miles.
You'll come right to the town.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.639
Thanks.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.155
Lucas stole my money.
He drinks everything in sight.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.595
I saved for a year and a half
for a course.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.399
Don't go, Paul.
You was my firstborn... .

04:35.560 --> 04:38.950
- Hitting everyone in his way. Even you.
- Only when he's drinking.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.879
That's been every night.
Why did you marry him?

04:42.120 --> 04:46.113
When your real pa died, you and Selena
and Joey had to have a father.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.794
Lucas tries hard to be a good man.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.875
- Goodbye, Ma.
- Paul.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.510
Selena, don't you ask me to stay.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.638
My babysitting money.
I wish there was more.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.879
Paul.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.476
Paul, I'll do extra work.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.753
I'll find a job and get
the money back. Don't leave.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.275
I'm sorry we got into a fight.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.275
It won't happen again.
I give you my word.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.795
Paul, Paul!

05:24.120 --> 05:27.954
He'll come back. You wait and see,
he'll come back.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.279
Nellie...

05:35.520 --> 05:38.876
...I'm going to try hard not
to drink anymore.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.318
Selena...

05:43.040 --> 05:46.635
...I'm gonna try harder
than I ever tried anything.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.356
- Morning.
- Good morning.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.159
May I have fried eggs
and a cup of coffee, please?

07:10.320 --> 07:12.436
- All right.
- Do you have a washroom...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.511
...where I can clean up?
- First door.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.999
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.594
- What you selling?
- Nothing.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.431
Sorry, I thought you might
be a traveling man.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.835
No, I came here to get a job.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.513
I should have known.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.956
I hear Harrington Woolen Mills got
some government contracts...

07:30.120 --> 07:32.031
...for military uniform cloth.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.918
A lot of people will move here.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.071
Which way is it to Harrington Mills?

07:36.280 --> 07:40.114
Follow Elm Street to the river
then look up to your right.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.398
You'll hate it.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.270
- Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie.
- Morning, Nellie.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.916
Paul left this morning.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.230
- Left for where?
- Don't know.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.437
Says he wants to leave town
and make something of himself.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.034
Instead of working all the time
at the mill.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.788
- He wants to see the world.
- Who is?

08:23.960 --> 08:26.758
Paul. He left town this morning.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.474
Allison, must you play records
so early?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.079
Good breakfast music.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.592
Digest your juice with culture.

08:33.799 --> 08:36.871
I'm glad about Paul, Nellie.
How did Selena take it?

08:37.039 --> 08:40.032
She's glad too. But she
ain't a mother. Neither are you.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.510
I'd like to see the world.
Have a romance in Venice.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.717
Meet a tall stranger in Hong Kong.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.996
- Allison, don't eat so fast.
- Have to.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.549
Senior class is giving a gift
to Ms. Thornton.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.918
I wrote a speech that Rodney
Harrington's going to read.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.355
- Badly, I'm sure.
- What's going on?

08:56.520 --> 08:58.590
A meeting to appoint a new principal.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.554
- How do you know it'll be Ms. Thornton?
- Nobody else deserves it.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.915
I'll drop by the store after school.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.119
Goodbye, Dad.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.431
I wish you'd stop that ridiculous
performance every day.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.433
What? Saying goodbye
or hello to my father?

09:15.640 --> 09:16.993
Saying it to a photograph.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.591
I suppose it's silly,
but it makes me feel that he's here.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.318
You scarcely knew him.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.199
It's not my fault he died
when I was two.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.358
I can't remember him, I admit,
but I miss him.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.158
You mean, you miss a father.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.879
Yes, Mother.

09:32.200 --> 09:36.671
Wouldn't it be nice if you had men
friends, or dates, or even marry again?

09:36.960 --> 09:39.872
Stop talking about fathers,
husbands and marriage.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.349
You miss him more
than I ever realized.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.399
I'm sorry, Mother.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.479
I'll be late.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.873
Forgot the speech.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.753
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Bye.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.232
- Good morning, Ms. Lancie.
- Good Morning, Allison.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.799
Hi, David.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.277
- Good morning, Mr. Herman.
- Morning, Miss Allison.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.919
Go on home, Buffy.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.396
- Hi, Dr. Swain.
- Morning, Allison.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.915
- Good morning, girls.
- Morning, doctor.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.549
- Good Morning, Mr. Cross.
- Morning.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.479
Thank you, Norman.

11:16.640 --> 11:20.997
- Everything's gone wrong this morning.
- Lf you didn't run all the time... .

11:24.840 --> 11:26.796
Ted's bringing the gift.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.832
Rodney.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.399
Here's the speech.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.473
- I'll never memorize this.
- Then just read it.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.633
She's coming! Miss Thornton's coming!

11:44.280 --> 11:45.633
Hey. Hey.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.359
"The job of principal of
Peyton Place High School. "

11:54.720 --> 11:56.039
Quiet.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.279
Ms. Thornton, the senior class
has asked me to say a few words...

12:06.480 --> 12:09.278
...and on behalf of them,
to present this gift to you.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.189
"Our names are inscribed inside
the cover of that dictionary.

12:19.360 --> 12:23.399
Because there are so many words
to express what we feel for you...

12:23.560 --> 12:26.074
...and your long services
to the school...

12:26.240 --> 12:29.915
...we decided to give you all the words
in the language.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.396
We're losing you, but to something
bigger and more important:

12:33.680 --> 12:36.353
The job of principal
of Peyton Place High School.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.431
So you'll know we'll never forget...

12:38.600 --> 12:42.559
...you can always turn to the words
love, friendship and remembrance...

12:42.720 --> 12:45.518
...and know that we're always
thinking them. "

12:53.280 --> 12:56.352
This is the loveliest thing
that ever happened to me.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.799
I... .

13:02.480 --> 13:04.710
There's another word in this book.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.719
Gratitude.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.958
Now, let's talk about graduation.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.598
I would like a report from the
president of the class, Ted Carter.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.156
Ms. Thornton, I've arranged
for all the necessary committees...

13:20.320 --> 13:24.518
...and if they all do their jobs well,
I'm sure we'll have a fine graduation.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.713
Vice president, Selena Cross.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.759
The programs will be printed
in a couple of weeks...

13:30.920 --> 13:33.957
...and I've rented caps and gowns
at $2.50 apiece.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.669
And we're gonna have a tea
and a reception on the lawn afterwards.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.595
Editor of the yearbook,
Allison MacKenzie.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.434
The copy's all done.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.751
But the engraver's going mad
waiting for all the pictures.

13:46.920 --> 13:51.232
Whoever doesn't have his picture in
by Wednesday won't be in the yearbook.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.196
Senior dance, Betty Anderson.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.632
Everybody has to help
with the decorations.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.076
The tickets are printed
and will go on sale a week before.

14:03.360 --> 14:07.478
I'm supposed to announce there's
to be no necking in the parking lot.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.309
Nor anywhere else, for that matter.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.316
Harrington, Elsie Thornton
has earned the right to be principal.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.916
She's given her life to this town.
At least we can recognize it.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.675
As head of this school board,
it's my opinion she should be retired.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.355
I'm afraid I can't quite concur with you.
I agree with Doc Swain.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.956
You would.
Ms. Thornton's practically senile.

14:46.160 --> 14:51.029
A hypochondriac, uses sleeping pills.
You want a drug addict for a principal?

14:51.240 --> 14:55.074
Marion, it seems to me that I write
a lot of prescriptions for you.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.437
As far as Ms. Thornton being senile,
she's of your generation.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.238
She is not. I'm 36.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.518
You're 45. My father delivered you
the year they built the courthouse, 1896.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.954
We need someone young.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.635
This fellow who's coming
is well recommended.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.075
And I can get him
at the right price.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.117
Mr. Harrington, he's outside.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.036
He can't do us much good out there,
Ms. Colton. Send him in.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.709
- Would you come in, Mr. Rossi?
- Yes. Thank you.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.555
- Good morning.
- I'm Leslie Harrington.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.039
This is the school board.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.478
Mr. And Mrs. Partridge.
He's a lawyer. Dr. Swain.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.837
Seth Bushwell. He's editor
of the Peyton Place Times.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.715
Mr. Rossi, here's our situation.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.316
We're prepared to offer the job
as principal to a qualified man...

15:41.480 --> 15:44.119
...with a minimum guaranteed
five-year contract.

15:44.280 --> 15:48.592
Mr. Rossi is a graduate of Penn State,
summa cum laude.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.758
He holds a master's degree
in English and literature.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.037
He was an outstanding athlete.
He's single.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.033
Personally, now that I've
seen him, I like what I see.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.431
- Did I miss anything?
- I've been working in construction.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.552
If you're a teacher,
why were you working there?

16:04.720 --> 16:07.188
I couldn't live on the salary
of a teacher.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.193
This job starts at 3000 a year.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.271
Then we're all wasting our time.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.557
That's only $5 a week more
than I was making as a teacher.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.429
But this offers you security.
A long-term contract.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.239
Guaranteed poverty is not security.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.790
I want 5000 a year and a raise
of 500 in the second year.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.235
- We can't do it.
- You own this mill.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.630
How much do you pay a foreman,
$200 a week?

16:31.920 --> 16:35.435
This is business. These men manufacture
a product that makes money.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.477
Be practical and face realities.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.480
To people like you,
education is a necessary evil.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.710
You can't see it,
so it's worth nothing.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.838
Let me tell you this,
the things we can't see...

16:46.040 --> 16:49.999
...are the most important things
on this earth. They're called ideas.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.158
Thank you for the interview.

16:52.320 --> 16:56.836
If we offer you 5000, would you
coach the basketball and football team?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.831
No, I would not.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.436
If you can't pay the principal
of your school a decent salary...

17:02.600 --> 17:05.478
...you have no right to be
running a school.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.278
Mr. Rossi.

17:07.599 --> 17:11.798
Leslie, I'm afraid you're fighting
a losing battle.

17:12.319 --> 17:13.958
Now, Mr. Rossi, frankly... .

17:14.240 --> 17:20.156
In other words, the life history of the
race repeats itself in the individual.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.553
- A notice from the school board.
- Thank you.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.478
"Effective immediately...

17:31.640 --> 17:34.837
...the school board of Peyton Place
is happy to announce...

17:35.000 --> 17:37.912
...the appointment of a new
school principal:

17:38.720 --> 17:40.756
Mr. Michael Rossi. "

17:42.880 --> 17:44.199
Who?

17:44.400 --> 17:47.949
"We trust that you will show him
the same loyalty and devotion...

17:48.120 --> 17:50.998
...you displayed to the late Mr. Firth. "

17:54.960 --> 17:56.279
Class dismissed.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.873
I'm sorry, Ms. Thornton.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.710
I don't know how they could do such
a thing. You deserve to be principal.

18:15.880 --> 18:19.668
Allison, a person doesn't
always get what she deserves.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.438
Remember it.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.319
If there's anything in life you want,
go and get it.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.631
Don't wait for anybody
to give it to you.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.395
Now, I have some work to do.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.633
See you later, Al.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.033
- Here we are.
- Good-looking school, doc.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.994
That must be the new principal,
you know?

19:02.520 --> 19:05.239
They really give it to you, didn't they?

19:06.160 --> 19:08.958
Like everybody else,
they really give it to you.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.473
Have you been drinking?

19:10.640 --> 19:15.077
Work yourself to death, then they
bring in an outsider to pick the plum.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.958
You have been drinking.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.116
I know you keep a bottle in the
basement, but I won't have you...

19:21.280 --> 19:24.033
...bring it into the classroom, ever.
Don't forget.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.118
It'd do your kids good to learn
how to handle liquor...

19:27.280 --> 19:28.793
...instead of algebra.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.679
- You're talking like a fool.
- Oh, be I.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.510
I sat in this classroom four years.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.669
I sat right here.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.359
Everything important
was learned somewheres else.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.953
You never applied yourself.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.032
If you had, you might've
learned something in school.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.952
Tell my wife, a cleaning woman.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.237
- Tell me, a janitor, cleaning toilets.
- Stop it!

19:55.400 --> 19:58.836
- Tell every mill worker behind on his bills.
- I said, stop it.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.437
If you had applied yourself, you might
have learned how to live intelligently.

20:03.880 --> 20:07.316
There ain't nobody in this here town
living intelligently. Nobody.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.199
- I don't believe that.
- All right.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.917
Name me one important person
graduated from this here school.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.958
Name one. You can't.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.709
I'm gonna tell you something,
Ms. Thornton...

20:19.880 --> 20:22.872
...something you can
teach your class someday.

20:23.040 --> 20:27.875
The minute they walk out that door,
they walk into a dog-eat-dog world.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.597
It's crawl in front of the big dogs
if you want to eat, get a job.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.913
I won't do it. I won't do it!

20:36.840 --> 20:41.675
That's why I'm washing windows,
scrubbing walls, emptying ashes.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.790
I never had nothing I ever wanted.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.472
Shakespeare did me no more good...

20:51.640 --> 20:53.949
...than Washington did
crossing the Delaware.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.031
You didn't help yourself.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.229
Elsie, I'd like to have you meet
Mike Rossi. Ms. Thornton.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.796
- Hello, Ms. Thornton.
- Mr. Rossi.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.916
- Welcome to Peyton Place.
- Thank you.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.640
This is our utility man, Lucas Cross.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.753
- Hello, Lucas.
- My hand's too dirty.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.396
I'll start on another room.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.392
Does he always drink?

21:18.560 --> 21:22.792
He's disappointed for me. Loyalty is
always more passionate than reason.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.350
I guess that's why I came
to see you first.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.829
There was sentiment
for making you principal.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.391
Please don't feel uncomfortable,
Mr. Rossi. My time came too late.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.070
- I hope we can work together.
- Of course we can.

21:36.240 --> 21:39.198
I suppose you have a lot of new,
progressive ideas.

21:39.480 --> 21:43.314
No, not really. I'm rather
old-fashioned, as a matter of fact.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.277
I have just two rules:

21:46.000 --> 21:49.595
First, I want this school to teach
the truth as far as we know it.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.548
I don't want any teacher making
a fairy tale out of life.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.598
It's hard enough without
being unequipped to meet it.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.239
That's a good rule.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.833
Shall we sit down?

22:02.240 --> 22:03.832
And rule two...

22:04.320 --> 22:08.029
...teach a minimum of facts
and maximum of ideas.

22:08.200 --> 22:12.432
Our main job is to teach children
how to think, not just to memorize.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.392
If war comes for us...

22:14.560 --> 22:17.597
...these kids shouldn't fight
just for historical dates...

22:17.760 --> 22:19.910
...but for the ideals behind them.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.955
I like your rules, Mr. Rossi.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.514
Peyton Place is very fortunate.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.112
Thank you, Ms. Thornton.

22:37.840 --> 22:41.515
Allison, I don't know what Betty's
buying, but tell her to hurry.

22:41.680 --> 22:42.999
Okay.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.992
Mother, Ms. Thornton
didn't get the job.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.232
I know. Betty and Margie told me.
They're in the back.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.439
After giving her the gift and the speech,
it was embarrassing for her.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.999
She'll get over it.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.550
I'm glad I'm graduating.
I don't want to know the new principal.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.435
- Mrs. MacKenzie, about graduation... .
- What about it, sweetie?

23:08.640 --> 23:10.995
Mother needs a new dress
for the exercises.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.594
Could I make some arrangement
to buy her one?

23:13.760 --> 23:17.116
After I graduate I'll get a job
and I could pay you back.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.390
You'll be needing
a new dress yourself.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.676
I can get by.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.631
Look, with Easter and graduation
coming on, I'll be needing some help.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.354
Would you like to work
afternoons and Saturdays?

23:29.520 --> 23:31.670
- I'd love to!
- Fine.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.308
- Then I could buy two dresses.
- Wholesale.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.711
No girl ever had two better friends
than you and Allison.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.759
When you see how hard Mother makes
you work, you won't say that.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.356
- Rodney's outside.
- Good, let him wait.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.716
You'll be arrested for wearing that.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.199
No, just picked up.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.635
Mother says women
should be mysterious.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.837
- Do you think the dress is too old?
- No, you're too young.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.355
Won't people think you're a little fast?

23:58.520 --> 24:03.355
According to my philosophy, what other
people think will not pay the rent.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.752
If you're accused of being fast, might
as well run. Get the good things first.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.749
Just remember, men can see
much better than they can think.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.396
Believe me, a low-cut neckline
does more for a girl's future...

24:15.600 --> 24:18.034
...than the entire
Britannica encyclopedia.

24:18.240 --> 24:21.710
- Allison, could you help me a moment?
- Sure.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.238
- Be right back.
- Do you think Rod will like it?

24:29.320 --> 24:31.390
When you have
your 18th birthday party...

24:31.560 --> 24:33.869
...I don't want you
to invite Betty Anderson.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.792
I might as well not have a party.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.515
If I can't invite Betty,
Rodney won't come.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.999
I wouldn't mind that.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.516
If Rodney won't come, his friends won't.
Then nobody will accept.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.638
I can't understand why you want
to be friends with Betty.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.360
I don't like the way
she talks about men and sex.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.034
It appears the only
perfect individual is you.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.475
We've had 17 dull
birthday parties alone.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.154
Could you let me have one
for myself, please?

24:59.960 --> 25:02.428
Allison, what about Betty?

25:10.880 --> 25:12.757
Hi, Norman.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.478
Oh, hi, Allison.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.799
What's the matter?

25:20.160 --> 25:21.991
Same old thing.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.278
Grownups who act like children.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.717
Hey, could I walk home with you?

25:27.880 --> 25:29.871
No. You'd get home late.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.156
You mean,
your mother wouldn't like it.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.473
- Well... .
- Come on, Norman. Come on.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.159
Spend the afternoon
in the library again?

25:40.320 --> 25:41.639
Yeah.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.640
Isn't it awfully dull
going there every day?

25:46.240 --> 25:47.559
Yeah.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.236
Then why do you do it?

25:51.760 --> 25:55.230
I like books. Good place
to do my homework.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.394
Besides, where else could I go
but home?

25:59.120 --> 26:00.838
Go down to the water.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.752
Sit in the square.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.191
Take a walk in the woods.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.159
I can't.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.756
You know, that was a nice speech
you wrote for Mrs. Thornton.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.958
I'm sorry I did it now.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.430
Why didn't you read it yourself
instead of Rodney Harrington?

26:17.800 --> 26:19.870
Because I was afraid I'd cry.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.999
Still might cry every time I think
of Ms. Thornton not getting that job.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.672
You know, you just might turn out
to be a great writer.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.910
Norman, I hope so.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.115
You know, every time I touch
a book or read a story...

26:34.280 --> 26:36.669
...or even when I
just open the dictionary...

26:36.840 --> 26:39.593
...something inside of me
goes thump...

26:40.320 --> 26:44.233
...and my heart starts pounding,
and my stomach.

26:46.240 --> 26:50.358
You know, it's how people are supposed
to feel when they fall in love.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.431
Of course, I never have.

26:53.840 --> 26:57.628
I wish I could be so sure of
what I wanted to do.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.991
You must have some idea.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.399
No.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.797
No, I've thought of everything,
but nothing seems to fit me.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.554
Maybe I'll be unique
and retire at the age of 18.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.075
Norman, it's about time
you got home.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.673
Hello, Ms. Page.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.428
- Goodbye, Norman.
- Wait just a minute, will you?

27:17.960 --> 27:20.235
- But you...
- I don't want to go in just yet.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.915
Norman, what an awful thing,
hating to go home.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.439
Come on in here.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.358
Well, thanks for walking with me.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.272
I enjoyed it, really.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.712
Goodbye.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.199
Goodbye.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.555
- May I walk on it, Nellie?
- Sure, it's dry by now.

27:46.960 --> 27:50.316
- Your mother wants you to call her.
- I really don't feel like it.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.472
You two have a fight again?

27:52.640 --> 27:55.438
Same fight, different round.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.472
- Nellie?
- Yeah.

27:57.640 --> 28:01.872
You've been both a daughter and
a mother. Which one is worse?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.395
- Being a mother.
- Why?

28:04.920 --> 28:07.070
You find yourself
doing the same things...

28:07.240 --> 28:09.708
...you hated your own
mother and father doing.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.791
That's very interesting.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.791
Doesn't somebody get intelligent...

28:13.960 --> 28:16.679
...and realize children
must grow up their own way?

28:17.040 --> 28:20.191
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.

28:20.440 --> 28:25.673
Kids get born and you just worry
about them and you hope for them.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.474
Well, I gotta get going.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.038
- Good night, Nellie.
- Good night, Allison.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.397
Hello? Oh, hello, Mother.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.670
I've been thinking it over.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.400
You can invite anyone you want
to your party.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.272
Oh, Mother, thank you.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.953
Thank you very much.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.435
I'll be home in a little while.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.353
Bye.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.355
2676J, please.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.678
Hey, watch where you're going there,
buddy, will you?

30:09.120 --> 30:10.599
- Thanks much.
- Thank you.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.678
- I want it.
- You don't need any.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.432
I want some!

30:17.440 --> 30:20.671
- Would you like a sandwich, Norman?
- No, thank you.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.199
Excuse me. Excuse me.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.038
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

30:31.200 --> 30:32.553
- How are you?
- How are you?

30:32.760 --> 30:34.876
- Betty and Rodney.
- Where's Ted Carter?

30:35.040 --> 30:36.473
Right here.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.552
Let's stop that corny music
and do some serious dancing.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.029
- Those are good records.
- These are new ones.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.509
- I brought some mistletoe.
- Mistletoe?

30:44.680 --> 30:47.558
- Hang it high, will you?
- Only if I can kiss Betty.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.392
Tonight, nobody is safe from me.

30:49.560 --> 30:53.519
- Hey, Christmas is eight months away.
- I do my Christmas kissing early.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.069
- Hey!
- Where's the punch?

30:56.240 --> 30:57.719
- It's over there.
- Oh, good.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.992
- Add the old family formula.
- Now you're talking, Rod.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.752
My mother wouldn't want me to...

31:02.920 --> 31:05.878
- Don't tell me she's here.
- No, she's at the movies.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.712
Put the booze in the bowl.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.950
That's the one thing
she made me promise.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.792
You want to have a party or not?

31:11.960 --> 31:14.633
- You can't fight city hall.
- Put the liquor in.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.236
Forget it. I know 10 other ways
to make a party successful.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.632
Now, first, we gotta make
the atmosphere a little more intimate.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.109
Rodney, aren't you the one.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.230
- Evening.
- Good evening. Hello, doc.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.913
Hi, Connie.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.390
- Just coffee, please.
- Right.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.279
Who's that, doc?

32:10.080 --> 32:12.594
That's Mrs. MacKenzie.
She runs a dress shop.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.399
She has a daughter
in the senior class, Allison.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.039
Beautiful woman.

32:17.760 --> 32:21.275
She's a widow. Born here,
but she had ambitions, and left.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.399
Married in New York to some ad genius.
When he died, she came back here.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.718
- I'd like to meet her.
- Wouldn't do you no good.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.239
Bring your coffee.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.356
Connie, you haven't met Mr. Rossi,
the new school principal.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.873
- How do you do?
- Hello.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.315
I hear about you every day
from my daughter.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.276
You've been working kind of late?

32:47.760 --> 32:50.752
No, I've been to the movies.
Allison's giving a party.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.115
What does she plan to do
after graduation?

32:53.280 --> 32:55.919
She'd like to be a writer.
I'd like her in college.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.914
It's too bad she has
no brothers and sisters.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.993
- Why do you say that?
- Just that I'm against only-child families.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.596
Only children receive all
the attention of the parents.

33:06.760 --> 33:09.638
- Good and bad.
- I don't think Allison turned out badly.

33:09.840 --> 33:13.037
She hasn't turned out yet.
Her life is just beginning.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.158
It's too late to give her
any brothers and sisters.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.835
In your case, I'd say it wasn't.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.713
If I didn't like you so much,
Matt... . No use...

33:21.880 --> 33:24.075
Now, Connie, don't you go
proposing to me.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.915
- For you, doc.
- Excuse me.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.279
Would you like a cigarette?

33:29.720 --> 33:31.551
- Swain speaking.
- Thank you.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.199
I'll be right over.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.790
Speak of babies and they appear.
Mrs. Runkle's in labor.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.279
I'll see you later.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.079
Thanks, doc.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.559
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.874
Doc Swain's always talking
about babies.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.157
- They're his stock-in-trade.
- Not a bad subject.

33:55.520 --> 33:59.035
We teach schoolchildren English and
math and history, and yet...

33:59.200 --> 34:02.431
...we neglect what gives them
the most trouble in life.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.154
You don't recommend classes
in baby-making?

34:05.320 --> 34:10.155
Only in theory. I intend to initiate
a sex-education course in the school.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.154
- Isn't that a function of the home?
- You'd think.

34:13.320 --> 34:17.279
And yet not one parent in 10 does it.
No, sex is taboo in the home.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.510
And it should be in the schools.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.833
Where would they learn it,
in parked cars?

34:23.080 --> 34:24.911
They'll learn it when they marry.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.556
Good night, Mr. Rossi.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.668
Doc Swain offers a special price
for frostbites.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.949
- Come on, Allison.
- Rodney.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.959
Allison!

35:18.520 --> 35:20.590
This was supposed to be
a birthday party.

35:20.760 --> 35:24.275
Just playing "photography": Turn off
the lights, see what develops.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.153
Don't be fresh.
Just leave immediately.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.598
- All of you!
- I just caught her under the mistletoe.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.273
Will you please leave?

35:32.920 --> 35:35.753
Happy birthday, Allison.
Come on, Betty.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.119
I'm sorry.

35:38.320 --> 35:39.309
Thanks anyway.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.512
Thanks, Allison.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.479
Come out here.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.272
Allison, I said come out here.

36:16.880 --> 36:19.269
I knew this would happen
if you invited Betty.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.715
- Wasn't her fault.
- And you making love...

36:21.880 --> 36:24.110
We were kissing, one kiss,
not making love.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.113
The house in darkness,
and couples necking all over.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.840
I know, but everyone wanted
to dance in the dark.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.396
And I couldn't very well... .

36:32.560 --> 36:35.870
Mother, at every party in this town,
they turn out the lights.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.315
I don't want you to be like everybody.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.511
I want you to rise above Peyton Place.

36:40.680 --> 36:43.592
It's my home, my town.
Why should I wanna rise above it?

36:43.760 --> 36:45.716
Because its standards are low.

36:45.880 --> 36:49.031
Its people spend their time
trying to drag each other down.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.872
I don't want to be perfect.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.111
I don't want to live in a test tube.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.630
I just want to be me, and have some fun,
and have some friends.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.356
I'd rather be liked than be perfect.

36:59.920 --> 37:04.869
By liked, you mean being pawed by
an animal with one thing on his mind.

37:05.080 --> 37:09.471
Don't make it sound like that. Everything
has to be learned, even kissing.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.116
And sex? Is that what you're going
to practice at your next party?

37:13.320 --> 37:16.835
You keep trying to accuse me of things
I'm not even thinking about.

37:18.520 --> 37:22.035
I don't want you to get a reputation
for a half-hour's carelessness.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.475
I already have one. The wrong kind.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.316
I want you to fall in love...

37:27.480 --> 37:30.597
...and at the proper time,
to marry a man who respects you.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.830
I want you to have a good name.
I want...

37:33.000 --> 37:35.195
You want! You want! You want!

37:35.400 --> 37:36.913
Is that all you can say?

37:37.120 --> 37:41.511
Well, if any man would ask me,
I'd run away and become his mistress.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.352
Don't you ever let me hear you
say a thing like that again!

37:45.520 --> 37:47.238
I don't know why I said it.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.151
I don't know why I said it.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.759
Allison.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.793
Hello, Trudy.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.188
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Joey.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.920
- Selena'll be out in a couple minutes.
- Thank you.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.116
Come on in back.
I got a new baby lamb.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.077
Oh, I'd love to see it.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.118
Oh, it's darling.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.516
I didn't show you my lizard.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.275
I keep him in a box right there.

39:32.520 --> 39:35.830
I got some holes punched in it,
just so he can breathe.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.793
His name is Pocahontas.

39:47.960 --> 39:52.351
Used to be, a man didn't have to cook
his own meals in his own house.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.996
Times have changed. Ma's working,
and I'm late for church.

39:59.320 --> 40:03.836
The way you parade yourself
up and down, taking off your clothes...

40:04.000 --> 40:05.911
- I don't parade up and down.
- You do!

40:06.160 --> 40:09.550
- You just like to show yourself off.
- I don't like to show off!

40:10.560 --> 40:14.633
Just because we don't live in a palace,
doesn't mean we have to act like pigs.

40:14.800 --> 40:18.588
- We've got a trash can, remember?
- Well, well, well.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.797
If you don't pick it up,
somebody else has to.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.357
And it wouldn't harm you to take
the garbage out and bury it.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.317
Or do you like living like a pig?

40:27.480 --> 40:30.040
What do you think you are,
always giving orders?

40:30.240 --> 40:31.673
Take your hands off of me!

40:39.400 --> 40:42.437
Don't you touch her.
Don't you touch her anymore!

40:47.160 --> 40:52.188
Just a little family fracas. Guess my
little girl's getting too big to spank.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.516
It was my fault, Allison.
I made him mad.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.878
Every family has fights.
They're forgotten in an hour.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.039
Come on.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.230
Hey, Norman, you know what?

41:45.360 --> 41:50.434
There's a place I know that I'd like
to show you, that no one knows about.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.389
Not even you. It's my secret place.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.158
I know every spot within three miles
of Peyton Place.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.878
Not this one. Come on.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.518
You were right. I never knew
this place was here.

42:34.120 --> 42:38.398
I don't think anybody does but me.
And maybe God.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.993
And now you.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.518
It's beautiful.

42:46.240 --> 42:50.677
I've just decided. This is the last time
I'm ever going to come here.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.359
Why?

42:55.520 --> 42:58.671
Oh, I'm gonna leave it
for somebody else to find.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.035
Maybe your children will discover it.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.317
I'm never going to marry.
I'm just going to have lovers.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.273
Oh, Allison.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.158
What's wrong with that?

43:08.640 --> 43:13.191
No children to grow up unhappy,
nobody gets hurt except maybe me.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.272
That's the worst kind
of emotional maladjustment.

43:16.440 --> 43:17.919
Who said so?

43:18.480 --> 43:20.948
- A book I read.
- What book?

43:21.520 --> 43:26.640
I sent for a book. It was $ 1.98,
in a plain wrapper.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.956
- A plain wrapper?
- Yeah, a plain wrap...

43:29.120 --> 43:32.237
And, well, it was
about marriage and sex.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.269
I had it sent to me at the post office.

43:35.440 --> 43:38.716
It took me two weeks to get up
the courage to go pick it up.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.119
Look... .

43:44.280 --> 43:48.273
I know it sounds funny, but it was
the only way I could find out anything.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.078
Norman, you know what?

43:50.240 --> 43:54.438
I sent for a book just like that
in the same plain wrapper...

43:54.600 --> 43:58.388
...general delivery.
- No, really? The same one?

43:58.560 --> 44:04.157
And I read every word of it, and I think
most of it's mid-Victorian nonsense.

44:04.960 --> 44:08.635
Maybe yours was better.
Hey, want to trade books?

44:08.920 --> 44:12.230
No. I'd be too embarrassed.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.395
That's your whole trouble, Norman.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.749
Everything embarrasses you.
Everything frightens you.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.239
I know.

44:22.920 --> 44:25.832
And I'm sorry we started talking
about all this.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.790
Hey, Norman, look... .

44:31.240 --> 44:37.190
It's about time you learned that girls
want to do the same things as boys.

44:38.040 --> 44:42.431
And they have the right to know how.
I mean, I think we should help each other.

44:43.960 --> 44:47.350
- Are you suggesting that...?
- Norman, don't get me wrong.

44:48.320 --> 44:52.791
All I want is some normal,
intelligent discussion...

44:52.960 --> 44:57.351
...and maybe some normal affection
between a boy and a girl, nothing more.

44:57.880 --> 45:02.112
Everybody in this town hides
behind plain wrappers.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.831
You're so afraid.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.631
You've even been afraid
to ask me to the graduation dance.

45:09.800 --> 45:14.635
Allison, I want... . Well, see,
I'm just not asking anybody.

45:14.840 --> 45:18.037
- I'll be there, but I can't ask you.
- Why not?

45:18.200 --> 45:19.952
Well, my mother.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.639
Your mother.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.118
Well, she wouldn't actually forbid it.

45:27.280 --> 45:30.511
It's just that she gets jealous
of anybody at all...

45:30.680 --> 45:32.636
...that I spend my time with.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.991
You don't know her.

45:35.160 --> 45:37.469
You don't have to live with her.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.713
But she's my mother.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.754
There's nothing I can do about that.

45:44.120 --> 45:46.475
You don't have to tell me
any more, Norman.

45:46.680 --> 45:48.955
Please, Allison,
I've gotta tell somebody.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.590
She won't let me have friends.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.152
She... .

45:56.160 --> 45:59.152
She makes me tell her 10 times a day
how much I love her.

45:59.600 --> 46:03.149
She's afraid she'll die alone
in a poorhouse.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.992
And marriage... .

46:07.160 --> 46:11.233
Marriage, she says, is misery.
And a woman can only cause me trouble.

46:11.440 --> 46:15.319
Oh, Norman, I can't believe it.

46:15.760 --> 46:17.432
Nobody would.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.512
Now maybe you know why I hate
to go home...

46:20.680 --> 46:23.240
...and why I live in the library...

46:23.520 --> 46:28.878
...and why I can't dance, or kiss girls,
or look anybody in the eye.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.237
You see, I'm a sissy and a coward.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.438
No, you're not, Norman.

46:34.960 --> 46:39.158
No one around town stopped to think
and give you a chance.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.109
You shouldn't be afraid of girls.

46:42.280 --> 46:45.477
I know, but I am, and I don't know
what I can do about it.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.154
- I know what you can do.
- What?

46:48.520 --> 46:50.272
You can start with me.

46:50.840 --> 46:54.355
I'll prove everything your mother
ever said was wrong.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.036
Would you kiss me, Norman?

46:58.200 --> 47:01.158
- I don't think I can.
- Yes, you could.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.559
Kiss me.

47:18.960 --> 47:21.713
I don't know why
I should act so experienced.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.030
It was only my second kiss this year.

47:25.600 --> 47:28.398
It wasn't as good as Rodney's, was it?

47:28.800 --> 47:30.119
No.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.756
Hello, I guess I should've phoned...

47:59.920 --> 48:02.753
...but I was in the neighborhood...
- That's all right.

48:02.920 --> 48:05.593
I have a message for Allison.
Is she home?

48:05.760 --> 48:09.309
No, she and Selena have just gone over
to Kathy Ellsworth's house.

48:09.480 --> 48:12.358
That gives me a good excuse
to talk to you.

48:13.440 --> 48:16.512
- May I come in?
- Oh, of course.

48:19.520 --> 48:22.353
- You have a lovely house.
- Thank you.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.359
Please come in.

48:32.040 --> 48:33.951
This is a very comfortable room.

48:34.120 --> 48:38.989
Good books, pictures.
My own hotel room is a bit basic.

48:39.200 --> 48:43.751
I have a mirror for shaving, a basin for
washing and a closet to hang my coat.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.273
You ought to find a house.

48:45.440 --> 48:46.714
I'm trying to.

48:46.880 --> 48:51.271
In the meantime, I have my hotel room,
which I clear out of right after dinner.

48:52.120 --> 48:54.998
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me.

48:55.720 --> 48:58.837
I was telling you something,
but you weren't listening.

49:01.360 --> 49:02.839
Your husband?

49:04.600 --> 49:06.716
He died when Allison was 2.

49:12.680 --> 49:14.557
And Allison.

49:14.760 --> 49:18.719
- A few years ago.
- She's grown a bit since then.

49:18.880 --> 49:22.953
I came to tell you that Allison
has been named valedictorian.

49:23.160 --> 49:27.233
Wonderful. She'll be terribly pleased,
and so am I.

49:27.440 --> 49:32.036
She's a fine girl, bright and sensitive.
You should be very proud of her.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.719
Yes, I am.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.830
Well, that's what I came about.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.758
Good night, Mrs. MacKenzie.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.070
You are lonely here, aren't you?

49:45.400 --> 49:47.994
It's not the worst thing
that can happen to you.

49:48.160 --> 49:51.152
- Isn't it?
- You can learn to live by yourself.

49:51.560 --> 49:53.312
You can get used to it.

49:53.480 --> 49:56.597
Maybe. But that doesn't make it
the best way to live.

49:56.760 --> 50:00.150
The best way?
What would that be?

50:00.320 --> 50:03.039
People meeting, talking.

50:04.600 --> 50:09.390
Well, in Peyton Place,
two people talking is a conspiracy.

50:09.680 --> 50:13.753
A meeting is an assignation, and getting
to know one another is a scandal.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.197
I think you're hard on the town
and hard on yourself.

50:17.360 --> 50:20.352
No, I'm quite all right the way I am.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.556
What were you gonna do tonight?

50:22.720 --> 50:25.871
Wash your hair? Read a book?
Go to the movies alone?

50:26.400 --> 50:29.870
- Well, it makes time pass.
- Time shouldn't just pass.

50:30.040 --> 50:31.473
It should be used.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.912
I wouldn't know where to begin.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.992
Begin at the beginning,
begin by getting out.

50:37.320 --> 50:39.550
We need another chaperon
for the dance.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.472
Why don't you help us out?

50:42.280 --> 50:43.918
Will you come?

50:49.120 --> 50:50.439
I think I'd like that.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.673
Fine.

50:54.400 --> 50:57.119
Good night, and thanks.

51:07.400 --> 51:09.709
- Good night.
- Good night.

51:22.320 --> 51:26.233
- Betty Anderson's father stopped me.
- What did he want?

51:26.400 --> 51:29.517
He asked when you'll marry Betty,
before or during college.

51:29.720 --> 51:34.157
- I hadn't exactly thought of marrying her.
- I wouldn't hear of it if you wanted to.

51:34.320 --> 51:37.232
Anderson's a good foreman,
but Betty is something else.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.914
- Yeah, I agree.
- Then stop seeing her.

51:40.080 --> 51:43.629
I just can't stop seeing her.
I invited her to the graduation dance.

51:43.800 --> 51:46.951
- Uninvite her.
- Now, Dad, I can't do that.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.109
You're gonna.

51:48.280 --> 51:51.511
Do you realize what it'd mean
if you married the local tramp?

51:51.680 --> 51:54.797
When you marry, you'll marry
someone on your own level.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.393
Call and tell her it's off.

51:56.560 --> 51:58.790
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Call her.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.956
- Please, Dad.
- Go on, call her!

52:03.880 --> 52:05.393
1042W, please.

52:05.560 --> 52:09.553
I can understand you wanting to see
this girl, but not in public.

52:09.720 --> 52:11.039
You know what I mean.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.516
Nobody's fighting you.
I'll be as big a Harrington as you are.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.672
I'll marry a cold fish,
then cheat the rest of my life.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.910
An apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

52:20.080 --> 52:22.230
But the graduation dance
is important.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.755
You want a new car, don't you?

52:25.400 --> 52:29.234
Betty? Hello, Betty. This is Rodney.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.357
Look, Betty, this is so terrible,
I don't know where to begin.

52:34.520 --> 52:35.748
Tell her.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.229
Betty, the graduation dance is off.

52:41.720 --> 52:44.359
She hung up. What a fine graduation.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.750
- I know someone you can take.
- Who?

52:46.960 --> 52:48.234
Allison MacKenzie.

52:48.400 --> 52:51.198
Her mother kicked me out of the house
for kissing her.

52:51.360 --> 52:54.352
I'll talk to her mother.
Allison's a girl of quality.

52:54.520 --> 52:58.911
Quality's a very good thing in woolen
cloth, but it's very dull on a big date.

53:15.200 --> 53:17.998
I didn't know you were
such a good dancer, Allison.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.957
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.514
- Hi, Rod.
- Hi there, Allison.

53:32.760 --> 53:35.069
Hey, Rodney, looking for someone?

53:36.360 --> 53:38.749
After the dance,
shall we go to Rockland?

53:38.920 --> 53:40.239
Okay.

53:40.680 --> 53:41.999
Oh, really?

53:56.600 --> 53:59.910
- Some more, Mrs. MacKenzie?
- No, thank you, Ms. Thornton.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.995
May I have this dance,
Mrs. MacKenzie?

54:09.480 --> 54:13.075
I haven't danced for such a long time,
I'm afraid I'd be terrible.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.549
Dancing isn't something you forget.

54:32.800 --> 54:36.918
I promised a dance to Betty, the second
one after intermission. Do you mind?

54:37.080 --> 54:38.991
No, not if you promised it to her.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.799
- Well, I'll see you around, okay?
- Okay.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.959
Allison.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.874
Did you see your mother
dancing with Mr. Rossi?

54:53.040 --> 54:56.032
- I've never seen my mother dance.
- Standing over there.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.351
They make a good-looking couple.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.359
They do?

55:10.240 --> 55:11.753
- Hi, Norman.
- Hi.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.956
Dance with me, Norman.

55:32.240 --> 55:35.630
- I don't know how.
- Just try.

55:44.040 --> 55:45.871
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.076
Hey, Rodney, you got a new car.

55:48.280 --> 55:50.794
Yeah. Hey, come on, get in.

55:51.080 --> 55:53.719
Rodney, it's beautiful.

56:00.600 --> 56:04.036
Here we are, snug as peas in a pod.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.950
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

56:07.120 --> 56:09.839
Hey, I'm mad at you.

56:11.680 --> 56:13.432
Come on, Betty.

56:14.560 --> 56:16.596
You really want to kiss me, don't you?

56:16.800 --> 56:20.588
- Boy, do I.
- Tell me how much. Tell me.

56:20.760 --> 56:23.149
I wanna kiss you more than anyone
in the world.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.788
I wanna kiss you 1000 times.
I never wanna stop.

56:25.960 --> 56:29.236
That's pretty good.
I'll give you one kiss.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.191
What would Allison say?

56:38.360 --> 56:41.193
Why bring her name up
at a time like this?

56:42.680 --> 56:45.240
Only one kiss to a customer.

56:46.920 --> 56:49.753
Betty, I couldn't help it.
My father made me call you.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.797
Wouldn't you rather be with me?

56:52.000 --> 56:55.151
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Tell me how much.

56:55.880 --> 56:58.474
In the whole world,
in the whole wide world...

56:58.640 --> 57:01.757
...there's nobody I'd rather be with
than you, Betty.

57:02.280 --> 57:04.077
Give me another kiss.

57:08.520 --> 57:09.839
Oh, honey, honey.

57:11.440 --> 57:15.035
- You want to make love to me?
- Yes, yes, of course I want to.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.709
Now go make love
to Allison MacKenzie!

57:27.880 --> 57:30.553
Go get the girl you brought
and try it with her.

57:30.880 --> 57:35.396
The next time I go out, it will be
with a man, not a papa's boy!

57:45.240 --> 57:46.878
Ladies and gentlemen.

57:47.040 --> 57:51.955
Pupils and faculty of Peyton Place
High School, and especially the seniors.

57:52.800 --> 57:56.839
They tell me it is a tradition here
to end each graduation dance with...

57:57.000 --> 57:58.319
..."Auld Lang Syne. "

57:58.840 --> 58:02.276
Since I'm new here and not yet
part of your traditions...

58:02.440 --> 58:06.592
...I think the song should be led by
a woman who has been with you long.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.751
Ms. Elsie Thornton.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.997
Thank you, Mr. Rossi.

58:26.560 --> 58:31.156
We're a small spot in a small town
on a great big map.

58:32.400 --> 58:36.837
And maybe Peyton Place High School
isn't a name that shakes the world...

58:38.360 --> 58:40.999
...but it's a part
of each of you forever.

58:43.280 --> 58:45.555
Make it great by honoring it...

58:46.760 --> 58:50.070
...and come back to see us
whenever you can.

58:51.160 --> 58:53.435
Now let's form a big circle...

58:54.160 --> 58:56.151
...everyone holding hands.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.757
It's an odd feeling, being in a school
when it's so quiet.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.990
I always think of it as sleeping...

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.197
...resting up from the pounding
it takes during the day.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.590
- Do you work at night?
- Yes, quite often.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.957
You don't realize the preparation
it takes to be a teacher.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.479
It's like... .

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.753
It's like all these kids were my own.
I love them. I want so much for them.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.438
It's more than a job to you,
isn't it?

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.319
I didn't mean to sound
like the dedicated idealist.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.630
Well, there's nothing wrong in that.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.479
Connie.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.953
- I did want to thank you for coming.
- You don't have to. I enjoyed everything.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.589
Including the dancing?

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.553
Including.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.831
You're wasting your time, Mike.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.557
I had my love a long time ago.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.152
And when my husband died,
I came back here.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.355
And I've had no time for anything
but Allison and the dress shop.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.353
- You've got time now.
- It's too late.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.478
- Look, Connie. If I were...
- I said it's too late.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.079
I made my choice...

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.599
...Iong ago.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.278
Please take me home.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.439
Sure.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.391
Selena, let's get married.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.799
You mean now?

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.110
Sure. I can get a full-time job.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.999
But what about college and law school
that you've always talked about?

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.915
That's just a dream. I can't do it.
My old man doesn't make enough...

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:16.029
Whose father does? Not everyone
in college is a millionaire's son.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.718
Don't get so steamed up.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.998
Ted Carter, you've always wanted
to be a lawyer. Now, go be it.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.828
Don't crumple up at the first obstacle.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.316
The first obstacle's the biggest,
the money.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.993
Well, then get over that
and the rest should be easy.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.319
Do you know how long it takes
to become a lawyer?

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.434
What difference does it make?
It's what you wanna do in life.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.593
One of the things I want to do
is marry you.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.399
If I don't do it now,
maybe I never will.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.071
Ted, the only family I'll ever have
will be half yours.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.989
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.319
Good night.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.559
Good night, Selena.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.839
Ted...

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.999
...thank you.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.599
Ma?

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.759
Ma?

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.799
Joey?

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.072
I thought you was something
out of a dream.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.196
Where's Ma and Joey?

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.318
Let's have a drink,
celebrate your growing up.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.595
Where's Ma and Joey?

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.514
They're working at a party at
Harrington's. Let's have a drink.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.030
Rather stay in the dark,
getting kissed by Ted Carter.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.391
I'm going to bed.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.120
It's about time I started teaching
you something.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.430
Lucas! Let me go, Lucas!

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.112
Never had nothing I ever wanted.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.311
Never had a beautiful woman.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.559
Let me up.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:07.149
Let me offer to the class of 1941
this fond farewell.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.034
The world outside waits for you.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.836
It is a world full of love
and rich in opportunity.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.514
There may be dangers, but if you hold
firm to your purpose and your ideals...

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.593
...you will storm the ramparts
of success and capture them.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.833
Tomorrow you grow up
and your true happiness begins.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.432
- Thank you.
- My best wishes to you.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.592
Selena Cross.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.599
Norman.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.469
At first a diploma seemed
like a reward for the past...

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.753
...but once in your hand,
it became an obligation to the future.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.756
Independence was a distant word
that we suddenly owned...

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.036
...and we exploded with it.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.158
Some of us splashed
away the summer...

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.392
...or swooped and stretched
with joyfulness...

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.996
...and emptied our childish piggy banks
of their play money.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.916
Yet others of us, eager to feel adult
or out of necessity...

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.957
...began our work early.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.997
- Put the bottle up on top.
- Here?

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.115
And gradually, as the happy confusion
of summer faded...

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.832
...one by one, we knew the Monday
morning of responsibility was at hand.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.953
- Hi, Mr. Rossi.
- Hello, Allison.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.874
Did you read those stories
I gave you?

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.270
Yes, I read them.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.359
Well?

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.476
- When did you write them?
- All summer.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.996
- Ever since graduation.
- Has anybody else seen them?

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.918
Only Selena.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.156
She thinks I'm a genius.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:11.071
What do you think? Are they good
enough to send to a magazine?

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.268
Yes, if you want to end up in prison.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.472
Those stories were full of enough
libel and slander...

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.279
...and double-entendre to hang us all.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.989
Allison, is that how Peyton Place
really looks to you?

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:28.150
They were only fiction.
I didn't use any real names.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.670
You didn't have to.
I recognized everybody in town.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:37.189
But let's get down to the important part.
You have a talent.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.716
Those stories were a good start.
Now, where do you go from here?

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.754
That's what I hoped to find out
from you.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.912
Then I suggest college.
With your talent and your ideas...

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:51.631
Thank you, but I don't want to go
to college. I never have.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.273
Why not?

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.876
Because I don't want to study
about writing. I want to write.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.917
Nobody has to tell me Shakespeare
was a wonderful writer...

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.799
...or that wonderful books
have already been written.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.191
Those books tell you how and why.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.510
I'd rather find that out myself
at a typewriter.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.996
I need someplace to get me going.
Someplace to start.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.238
All right...

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.751
...if that's how you feel about it,
then let's do it.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.792
Let's start at the Peyton Place Times.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.430
Who said I was a cynical,
hard-hearted newspaperman?

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.518
Aren't all newspapermen?

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.475
That's a myth. We're the most
sentimental slobs in the world.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.837
- The softest touches there are.
- Prove it.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.919
All right.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.709
When do I start? All I want is a chance
to show what I can do.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.439
Write something up this week,
I'll run it Friday.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.751
Thank you, Mr. Bushwell.
I'll start right away.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.229
- I'll dig up a story you'll never forget.
- I don't doubt it.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.710
Just remember, there's no such
thing as a cheap lawsuit.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.633
Hold on. We haven't discussed pay.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.189
You don't have to.
I'll do it for experience.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:09.875
The first thing experience teaches us
is to get paid.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.952
Five dollars a column to start.
More later.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.198
That's more... .

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.515
I wouldn't want these stories
to fall into the wrong hands.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:25.707
Thanks, Seth.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.669
There's no question, the tests confirm
that you're pregnant, Selena.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.269
I'd say about three months.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.551
- Who's the father?
- I won't tell you.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.514
Now, what kind of rot is that?
You're not the first girl in the world...

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.796
...who had to get married.
Or in this town, for that matter.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.154
Who's the father? Ted Carter?

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.276
- No.
- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.749
I'm not lying to you.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.912
Doc, help me. I need your help.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.230
What do you mean by "help"?

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.437
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.477
There's nothing I can give you.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.633
Tell me who's responsible. I can help you
that way. You can get married.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.836
He's already married.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.474
Then he'll have to take care of you
and provide for the baby. Who is it?

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.632
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.477
I've done a lot of things,
but I've never broken a law.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.837
What you're asking me to do
is break the law of man and God.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.350
Now, tell me, who is the man?

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.795
Selena, tell me who he is. Who is he?

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.272
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather! It's Lucas!

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.595
Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.916
I've got Selena in my office.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.399
Selena? What for?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.235
She's pregnant.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.033
I told her she'd get in trouble.
Always wrestling with that Carter boy.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.949
- I told her, she wouldn't listen...
- You low, miserable, crazy slime.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.157
- Don't you go shoving...
- That's your child she's carrying.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.954
- It ain't.
- I can prove it, Lucas.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.878
I've got enough proof on you
to put you in jail for the rest of your life.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.554
- I never touched her.
- Here, sign that.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.557
It's a statement of the facts.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.439
Are you out of your mind?
I never touched her!

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.319
Maybe you'd like the police
to sweat it out of you.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.995
I never touched her, and I ain't
gonna sign nothing that said I did.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.517
If you don't want to sign this paper,
that's up to you.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.559
Hey, doc... .

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.870
You know I couldn't do nothing
as awful as that, don't you?

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.632
I'm going back to my office.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.679
I'm gonna start telephoning
every father in Peyton Place.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.279
You wouldn't.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.273
I don't know what they'll do,
but I do know this:

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.671
You're the janitor in a school
full of young girls...

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.877
...and an hour from now,
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.632
Don't do it.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:05.190
I wouldn't think of fooling around
with any other girls.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.476
It was just Selena, doc.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.474
Well, there was something about her.
It was just Selena.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.358
Please, doc, don't.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.359
There's only one thing that'll stop me.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.072
You sign that.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.476
If I sign it, what are you
gonna do with it?

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.790
I'll lock it up in my safe.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.839
Give me the pen.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.551
Now, get out
and leave a man to work.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.995
No, Lucas. You get out.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.479
- You get out of Peyton Place before dark.
- Doc, I signed it for you!

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.952
If you do, I'll keep this in my safe.
But if you don't, I'll use it against you.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.269
I signed it!

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.230
Don't you ever try to come back here.
Not next week, not next year, not ever.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.152
If you do, I'll kill you myself.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.799
Why you little... .

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.952
Mary.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.396
Unofficially, this was a miscarriage...

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.632
...but officially, for the records,
it's an appendectomy.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.156
- That's a lie.
- I removed her appendix. Understand?

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.754
You want to ruin a girl's life
for one word?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.310
- No, but falsifying records... .
- I'll make them out personally...

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.438
...and if you tell anybody
this wasn't an appendectomy...

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.797
...I'll tell the whole town about you
and that drug salesman.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.552
Doc, that's blackmail.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.278
It sure is.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.399
Nellie, she's all right now.
She's just fine.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.919
Thank God.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.678
What a disgrace, disgrace!

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.432
- Disgrace!
- Nellie.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.718
Don't talk that way. Nobody's ever
gonna know but the three of us.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.950
People find out.
They always find out.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.148
Nobody will find out as long as you
don't say a word. Understand?

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.919
- No, I won't.
- Good.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.752
Now, you run on home now.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.232
- Thank you, doctor.
- That's a good girl.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.159
Thanks.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.236
And don't worry about your job.
It'll always be waiting for you.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.311
Thanks for the beautiful bed jacket.

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.232
Hi, Mrs. MacKenzie.
Hi, Allison.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.038
- Hi, Ted.
- We were just leaving.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.794
- Don't let me rush you out.
- We have to go.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.951
Goodbye, Selena. See you soon.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.071
They say it'll bloom for a month.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.835
You can plant it in your yard
as a reminder of your operation.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.558
Here's a book on humor.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.836
Surgery's nothing these days.
You'll be up before you know it.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.915
I went to see Mr. Rossi today,
talked about how to get to college.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.311
He said he might be able to wrangle me
a scholarship.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.758
He talked Mr. Partridge into taking me
into his office as an office boy.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.672
How about that?

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.068
That's just fine.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.117
Only thing is, if I work there a year,
it'll be eight years instead of seven...

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.840
...before I can pass the bar exam.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.030
Selena, I don't want to
wait that long.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.510
I want to marry you now
and become a lawyer too.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.350
Honey, don't cry.
It's nothing to cry about.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.950
Please go, Ted. Just go.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.319
Okay.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.791
I guess I picked the wrong time.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.793
I'll come back tomorrow,
when you're feeling better.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.677
Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.113
Why, Nellie...

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.715
...you didn't have to come
to work today.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.030
Work keeps my mind off of things.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.111
Selena's all right now, isn't she?

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.635
She'll be back to the store tomorrow.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.312
Everything is just trouble,
Mrs. MacKenzie. Just trouble.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.270
Nellie, don't do any work today.
Just sit around and relax.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.477
Happy Labor Day, Mother.
Something's wrong.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.039
She's upset.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.749
Can't blame her, with Lucas gone
and nobody knows where he is.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.758
I've gotta run.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.199
Bye.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.953
- Hi, Norman.
- Hi.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.678
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.959
Come on.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.830
Hello, Mike.
Where'd you come from?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.911
- Back there.
- Right here.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.153
Nothing's as dull
as a Labor Day speech.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.517
I didn't bring you here to explain
how management and labor...

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.240
...must pull together,
not in opposite directions.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.274
You've got living proof of it
in our prosperity.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.718
And there's more to come.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.678
Meet me halfway...

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.189
...and you'll never be unemployed...

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:26.150
...as long as men and women don't go
back to wearing fig leaves.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.552
And if they did, I'll bet...

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:35.276
...we'd be in the fig-leaf business sooner
than anybody east of the Alleghenies.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.319
Now...

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:44.395
...aside from this celebration,
this is a proud moment of my life.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.115
Tomorrow my son Rodney
leaves for Harvard.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:00.076
Let's get the fun started and
give him a sendoff! End of speech.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.192
Just beside myself.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.870
First Paul goes, and then Lucas.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.431
I don't know if Selena and me can keep
working and take care of Joey.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.479
- You'll just have to keep trying.
- I've been trying all my life.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.394
With a husband drunk all the time
and a grown girl...

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:43.192
...dressing and undressing in front of him,
and him staring at her all the time...

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.432
...staring at her and thinking... .
- Oh, Nellie.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.672
- We all have our problems.
- Staring at her...

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.558
...staring at her.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.399
...and staring at her.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.719
Hello.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.679
Hello.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.675
What are you doing out here
by yourself?

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.549
I'm not used to being at home
with Nellie.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.235
She has too many problems.
As for the outing, I've seen them all.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.870
Let's go for a drive, try to find
something interesting to do...

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.918
...far away from Peyton Place.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.517
Now you're beginning to think
like a true suspicious native. All right.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.828
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.837
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.474
Ready, set, go!

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.110
Hi, Harvard. Going to invite me
to the big game?

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.880
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.395
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.391
You've certainly improved with age.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.199
Things must've been dull for you
these past months.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.476
You're right. Come on,
let's take a walk.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.198
What would your father say?

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.749
Look, Betty, I don't care about that.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.638
- Come on.
- Outings leave me cold.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.473
Let's grab some sandwiches,
I've got a pint...

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.596
...and go down to Crystal Pond.

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.470
Hey, you can think for yourself
once in a while, can't you? Okay.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.509
Hey, let's go get a hot dog
or something.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:51.999
- Okay.
- Good.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.476
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:07.959
Okay?

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.277
- See that.
- What?

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.956
Allison and Norman on their way to
Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.796
So what? They're young, happy, maybe
in love. What trouble can they get into?

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.111
If you don't understand,
I'm not going to explain.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.432
- More?
- Why not?

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.989
Your father said to give you
a big sendoff.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.108
Rodney, will I ever see you again?

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.830
Can I compete with those Boston girls?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.592
What are your qualifications?

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.955
- Can't you guess?
- Seeing is believing.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.157
I think you're 10 percent man
and 90 percent talk.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.719
You're 100 percent woman.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.714
Two hundred and fifty percent woman.
Maybe 500.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.996
Going to take more than money
to keep me.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.276
Know what you're doing
to my temperature?

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:32.513
- Let's cool it off and go for a swim.
- But we didn't bring any bathing suits.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.273
- You all ready, Norman?
- Yeah.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.152
Forgot my cap.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.352
What did you say?

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.476
Norman, you're making me
blush all over.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.279
I'm sorry.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.311
Let's go in swimming.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.070
What did you whistle for?

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.277
I saw a fellow and a girl swimming,
without a stitch on.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.749
- Where?
- They're gone now.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.480
They got out of the water
and ran into the woods.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.949
- Naked?
- Naked.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.595
It was Allison MacKenzie
and Norman Page.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.676
I didn't really get a good look at them.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.155
Don't you lie to me, Charles.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.717
We're gonna pull out of here and
forget we even saw them.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.994
Betty, do you know
how much I like you?

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.038
I remember, faintly.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.317
I found out you can't always do
or say what you want to...

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.869
...that is, unless your father lets you.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.759
Rodney...

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.596
...are you going through all your life
only doing what your father lets you do?

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.797
Only having the friends
that he picks out for you...

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.078
...wearing what he tells you to wear,
thinking his thoughts?

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:26.516
Betty, I'm old enough,
but he's a tough man to handle.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.990
- You've got to do it someday.
- Yeah, but how?

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.239
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me. It's...

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.909
It's called marriage.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.671
Wouldn't that just bowl him over?

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.435
I'm sure it would. And me too.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.119
But...

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:51.313
...don't think of doing it
just to bowl him over.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.550
You're the only girl I've ever wanted.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.199
Rodney... .

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.151
Rodney, not that way.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.553
What good is life if I know I didn't
have the guts to live it my way?

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.994
Rodney.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:10.708
I've really loved you
for such a long time.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.796
It must take a lot of patience
to make something so beautiful.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.558
That's what they tell me.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.315
- All gone.
- Thank you.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.071
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.596
Saw them with my own eyes.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.755
Sorry, don't think it'd be ethical
to tell you their names. Goodbye.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.079
Marion.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.319
- Thanks for today.
- Anytime.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.757
How about tomorrow, for instance?

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.360
I can't remember when
I've had so much fun.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.036
I've almost forgotten the silly, wonderful
things there are for two people to do.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.519
It isn't over yet.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.473
Mike, please.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.358
- I don't think we'd better, I mean it!
- Connie, listen...

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.356
All right, let's talk about this.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.919
I don't want to talk.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.678
I just want you to leave.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.270
- Just like that?
- That's right.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.751
- We're not kids, we're adults.
- And we'll behave like adults.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.237
I kissed you, you kissed me.
That's affection, not carnality.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.868
That's not lust, you should
know the difference.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.952
What do you call a man
who thinks about nothing but...?

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.719
Human.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.837
All men are alike.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.550
The approach is different
but the result is always the same.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.472
Sooner or later, we get to this.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.599
If all I wanted was a woman, I could
get one in a bar, in a hotel lobby...

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.079
Or in my home?

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:58.789
- I'm not gonna let you make this dirty.
- What do you call it?

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.996
I'll tell you a truth about yourself.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.914
It isn't sex you're afraid of. It's love,
that's what you can't handle.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.594
That's what you offer me,
with your hands on me?

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.274
That's one expression,
backed up by many things.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.112
I haven't asked for any of them.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.316
Understand what you're saying no to.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.917
When I take you in my arms, I commit to
you, not just physically but all the way.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.516
That means I intend to worry about you,
to take care of you...

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:26.798
...and that's what I want back from you,
without any reservations or shame.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.430
- Either you're up to that or not.
- I have my standards and pride.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.036
They're not enough for anyone.
You need someone to trust, to love.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.998
No, I don't. I don't!
Now, just leave me alone.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.752
I can but I don't want to.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.674
Let me help you. I don't care
if you hang back. I'll give it time.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.876
I can't.

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.078
The offer is always open.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.715
I don't know if you'll take it up...

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.190
...but perhaps it'll make you feel better
to know it's there.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.039
Hello.

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.079
Yes, Marion.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.471
I don't believe it.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.551
Are you positive?

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.631
No. No, I'll call Mrs. Page myself.

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:48.679
Operator, will you please
connect me with Evelyn Page?

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.149
I don't believe Norman did
what you said.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.594
Two people saw them.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.719
- Marion has spread it all over town.
- Don't you say a word against Norman.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.155
If you'd brought him up
with intelligence...

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.914
He has no interest in girls.
He never had.

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.834
He never learned a thing about sex
in my house. It was never mentioned.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.471
- Hello, Mrs. Page.
- Come in here.

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.474
- Where's Norman?
- Outside, just going home.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.111
- Stay right here.
- What's the matter?

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.430
Norman! Come in here.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.233
What is it, Ma?

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.509
- Where were you today?
- What is it, Mother?

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:37.069
You were seen swimming in the nude
with Norman.

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.914
- That's a lie!
- How could you even think that?

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.036
You were seen clearly by two people.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.435
We went swimming,
but we had our suits on.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.598
And by now, everybody in Peyton Place
knows about it.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.916
If anything is wrong with her...

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:52.355
We didn't do anything,
did we, Allison?

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.954
- No.
- You better take your boy and go.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.872
We didn't do anything.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.237
I've never, never been so humiliated
and disgusted!

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.914
Allison! Come back here
immediately!

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.548
Keep this up and I'll do
what you accuse me of!

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:09.633
I wouldn't doubt it. You're just like your
father about sex. Just like him!

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.679
Don't say things about my father.
He was wonderful.

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.432
- Wonderful!
- And good to you.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.956
- You told me that, so don't blame him.
- Wonderful and good.

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.236
That's what I told you? Well, I lied.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.198
I lied because I was ashamed of him
and of myself.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.430
- Then why did you marry him?
- I didn't!

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.795
He didn't marry me
because he had a wife.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.758
- You don't mean that, Mother.
- I do mean it.

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.316
- Don't you understand?
- No.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.272
He had a wife!

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.799
No!

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.193
Nellie!

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.273
Allison.

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.596
Connie, everybody reacts differently
to suicide.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.598
With Allison, severe shock.

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.870
She looks so, so... .

01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:28.952
Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape...

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.350
...when the mind can't accept
what it sees.

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:34.478
A few days' care,
and she'll be out of it.

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.800
I guess I'd better tell Selena.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.433
And Connie...

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.752
...just because it happened in your house,
don't think any of it was your fault.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.239
Somehow I do.

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.517
You've got just one thing
to think about: Allison.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.430
If you were gonna get married,
why didn't you tell me?

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.956
- You wouldn't have approved.
- You never gave me a chance.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:11.908
At least it would've been a proper
marriage, not a cheap weekend affair.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.548
- Don't say that.
- Well, what was it?

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.396
- I'd like to talk with you alone.
- You can talk to both of us.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.109
This has to do with the business,
not your wife.

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.713
- I'll wait outside.
- Okay, honey.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.393
I can get it annulled.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.470
I don't want trouble between us. I was in
love with Betty and wanted to marry her.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.117
You weren't in love. You had an itching
for her. She took you, son. She took you.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.838
Goodbye, Dad.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.197
- When you come home, don't bring her.
- Then I won't be there.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.509
Rodney...

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.279
...what about college?

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.471
I'm not going.
I have to support her.

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.599
You can have a job here,
if you work like everyone else.

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.871
That's good enough for me.

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.477
Thanks, Dad.

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.434
I knew you weren't coming down
for lunch, so I thought... .

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.996
It's such a beautiful day, darling.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.958
Why don't you get dressed
and go for a walk?

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.995
You haven't spoken to me
for over a week, since... .

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.078
Allison, I understand how you feel.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.113
You'll just have to accept
what's happened...

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.713
...and make the best of it.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.119
Mother.

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:08.635
As soon as I can,
I'm going to get dressed...

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.439
...pack my things
and leave Peyton Place.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.273
I never want to see this town
or you again.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:21.911
- You can't mean that.
- I mean it. I'm going to New York.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.879
Please, Allison. I was only trying
to protect you.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.508
I was an accident you hated
and tried to hide.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.638
But I loved you from the moment
you were born.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.150
Try to believe me.

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.318
Well, how will you live?
What'll you do for money?

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:45.756
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.269
Suppose you can't find a job?

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.834
Then I'll live off some man,
the way you did.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.599
God.

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.794
God, help me.

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.919
Allison.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.879
Allison.

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.469
Didn't want you to come here.
I couldn't say goodbye to you in person.

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.359
- You know I don't want you to go.
- But I'm going.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.516
You stay here. You belong here,
both of us, together.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.996
- We've been friends since we were kids.
- Goodbye, Selena.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.836
Your mother, how can you
leave her alone?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.434
Mother's always been alone.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.273
Oh, Selena.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:37.000
I cried all the way to New York and my
eyes were the color of the oak leaves...

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.994
...that had started to fall back home.

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.635
For days, I struggled to keep alive
and I shivered with loneliness...

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.473
...in a back room
on the fourth floor of nowhere.

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:52.551
There were times when
I wanted to crawl home...

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:55.712
...but somehow I managed,
and I stayed.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.996
I learned what I could endure, but none
of us, in New York or in Peyton Place...

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.720
...could guess how much
would be demanded of us...

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.757
...that winter of deep despair.

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.197
I knew families at home would be
getting up on frosty mornings...

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:21.399
...driving their sons
to a place of hurried goodbye.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.991
I prayed for them.

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.028
Fellas, get your last cup
of civilian coffee.

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.760
The Army stuff is used
for waterproofing shingles.

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:35.797
That's what I heard.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.757
- You hear what Norman Page did?
- Became the first 4F in town.

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.235
No, he enlisted in the paratroopers.

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.038
- Our Norman?
- Norman Page?

01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.953
- He volunteered, the paratroopers.
- That's funny.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.237
- Maybe they'll drop his mother.
- She'd kill 1000 Japanese...

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.960
...before she'd let one touch
her little boy.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.716
Brought you a doughnut.

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.713
Rodney, I'm gonna cry.

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.715
No, you don't. Betty, you don't know
how glad I am that I married you.

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.110
Rodney, I hope so.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.191
Your father's over there.
Go say goodbye to him.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.434
Go on. Go say goodbye to him.
He loves you as much as I do.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.352
Go on.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:51.030
Take care of yourself and
whatever you do, do it honorably.

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:55.159
That's the family motto.
Do me a favor, Dad?

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.078
Certainly, son.

01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:01.916
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
She won't ask, but she might need it.

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:05.599
I'll keep an eye on her.

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:08.513
Would all the draftees
assemble over here, please.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.718
Come right in, folks.

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.429
Now, as chairman of the draft board,
let me say that all of us regret...

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:20.319
...having to send any of you men
off to war.

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.919
You carry our love, our devotion
and our undying gratitude.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.117
Please try to come back safely
to your homes.

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.834
Now, we've prepared
some gift packages.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.709
If you'll just step up here,
I'll hand them out.

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.798
Peyton Place draftees in the bus,
on the double. Let's go.

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:48.318
- Best of luck.
- Come on, boys, hurry it up.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.750
Make the goodbyes short.
Name, loud and strong. Last name.

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:58.160
- Culver, Jones... .
- Harvey.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:01.118
Keep going.
You boys are gonna love the Army.

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.793
- Elliot.
- Elliot, right.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:06.195
Hurry up in the back. Plenty of seats.

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:10.194
Nothing in the world's gonna stop me
from coming back. I love you, Selena.

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.679
I love you, Ted.

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:15.839
Come on, hurry up. On the double,
let's go, boys!

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:17.832
Got them all.

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.633
Hey, you.

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:24.678
Snap it up, on the double. Let's go.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:28.594
You know, you can write to her later
on government stationery.

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.793
That first winter away from home,
I took shape as an individual...

01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.757
...and toughened.

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.593
And with spring came the promise that
perhaps I had found my place in life.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.469
But part of me would keep escaping...

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.997
...and I'd find it running, in memory,
back through the fields of Peyton Place...

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.355
...or wandering down streets
now empty of young men.

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.637
I got a couple of funny ones.
This is from Ted Carter. He says:

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.157
"The food they serve here must have
been warmed over from World War I. "

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:34.354
Remember Fred Combes? He's in
the Navy. He says, "Dear Hyde:

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.992
I joined the Navy because I liked the way
they kept their ships neat and tidy.

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:45.996
But I never knew until now
who kept them that way: Me. "

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.956
The boys are getting around these days.

01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:53.954
I had a V-Mail letter just the other day
from someplace from Norman Page.

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.269
- Remember him?
- Sure.

01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.719
He said he dug a foxhole so deep that
it was just short of desertion.

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.877
And then the seasons spun by so fast
they seemed to become one.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:12.274
The war news was too big to grasp,
and too unhappy to understand.

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:17.789
Selena wrote me often about
Peyton Place, and I treasured her letters.

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.118
She always tried to mention
my mother...

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.232
...and tell me what people
were saying to each other...

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:25.879
...or were not saying.

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:37.552
Eventually, I broke the ice
of my intentions...

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.029
...and subscribed to
the Peyton Place Times.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.953
I was hungry for names that meant
something to me.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.069
But among them, unhappily, came the
names of those who were gone forever.

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:33.119
Betty... .

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:39.153
- Rodney asked me to take care of you.
- I don't need your help.

01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:41.276
But I need yours.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.239
Rodney was a better boy
for having married you.

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.437
When I was 6 years old,
I was in love with Rodney.

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:52.115
For years afterwards, I never even
thought about anybody else.

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:56.189
I was a kind of flashy girl, I know,
but Rodney liked flashy girls...

01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.555
...so that's the way I was gonna be.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:02.998
The funny thing is, Rodney always
loved me as much as I loved him.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.038
But you taught him appearances
count more than feelings!

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.952
I was wrong.

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.711
Rodney discovered it.

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.033
Let's... .

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.390
Let's keep what's left
of the family together.

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:27.473
A little brighter one, please.

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:29.710
- Did you hear about Mr. Rossi?
- No, what?

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.472
- He's leaving town.
- Leaving?

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.952
Not really. They're trying to get him to be
principal of a high school in Portland.

01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:39.396
- You sure?
- I'm sure. I got it firsthand.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.788
From Mr. Rossi?

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.476
From Kathy, who got it from Betty,
who got it from Ms. Thornton.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.155
- I suppose that's firsthand.
- We won't be able to keep him here.

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:51.835
- This is kind of nice. Can I try it on?
- Sure, come on.

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.072
Merry Christmas.

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:15.679
Come in.

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.473
Merry Christmas.

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.631
It's been a long time.
It is Christmas.

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.315
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.994
Come in. Let me take your coat.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.631
I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:35.951
- Can I fix you a drink?
- No, thank you.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.230
Well, come in, sit down.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.272
Well, I really came to... .

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.908
Is it true that you
might go to Portland?

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.752
Well, I've received the offer.

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:49.037
It's a larger school, and
naturally, much more money.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.838
- You'll take it.
- I don't know.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.072
I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.

01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.871
- Michael?
- Yes?

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.918
You were right.
I never thought I could say it...

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.150
...but you were right.
- About what?

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:09.552
During the past months, I've been able to
come to a few conclusions about myself.

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.508
- And what were they?
- Well, Michael, I've lied so long.

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.912
I was everything you said,
especially that night in the kitchen.

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:19.991
I wanted you more
than you wanted me.

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:23.755
- I had no right to say those things.
- Yes, you did.

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:27.276
- I came to tell you the truth.
- You don't owe me an explanation.

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.318
Allison didn't leave home because
of Nellie's suicide...

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:32.232
...but because she hated me.

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:36.075
- She won't answer my letters or calls.
- Why not?

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.550
The night you walked out,
Marion Partridge called me.

01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:41.392
She told me Allison and Norman...

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:44.597
I heard about that woman
and her phone calls.

01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:47.753
Well, I've always been
so afraid of scandal.

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:51.833
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:56.717
Without thinking, when Allison returned,
I told her some terrible things.

01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.518
What things?

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.110
Come on, Connie, what things?

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:07.669
I'm Allison's mother,
but I've never been married.

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:10.918
Not to Angus MacKenzie,
not to anyone.

01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.079
I went to New York
and lived with a married man.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:19.035
After he died, I came back here
and lied...

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.069
...and I've been lying ever since.

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:38.395
You want the truth...

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.109
...and when you get it,
you're just like everybody else.

01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.989
- They want anything but the truth.
- Connie. Connie!

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:51.113
I told you once that
the offer was always open.

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.794
That I'm committing myself
to you all the way...

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:59.717
...and that I plan to worry about you,
and take care of you. I meant that.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.558
Oh, Michael.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.596
- How's that?
- Fine.

01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.352
I'll get it.

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:19.870
- Merry Chris...
- Ain't you gonna invite me in?

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.799
That's not a very friendly greeting
after I broke my back getting here.

01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.951
Hi, Joey.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.430
Say, there's a blizzard
blowing up, big one.

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:31.868
Got a drink? I'm froze.

01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:35.271
You're nowhere near froze,
with all you've got in you already.

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.000
I see the Navy hasn't cured you
of drinking.

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.711
Cure me! Honey, the Navy's taught me
tricks you never heared of.

01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:48.633
Sure made a lot of changes
around here, ain't you?

01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.476
You bet we have, Lucas. And for a start,
you can pick up your things and go.

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.237
Ain't nobody gonna tell me what
I can't do in my own house.

01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:02.073
- This isn't your house anymore.
- I don't care.

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:04.629
This is still my place,
and don't forget it.

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:07.070
Did you just come back here
to make trouble?

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.034
- You heard about Ma, didn't you?
- Yep, heard about her.

01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:18.111
Hey, Joey, here's a quarter. Run along
now, huh? Come on, pick it up.

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:21.592
- Pick it up, Joey.
- Lucas, you leave him alone.

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.432
Oh, honey... .

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.750
No, don't start a fight.

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.276
Me and you got to know each other
a little too well for that.

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:33.592
Say, I didn't think you could improve,
but you sure have.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.955
It ain't like I was your real pa,
you know.

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:58.433
- You dirty, filthy animal!
- You're still a little wildcat, ain't you!

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:22.158
As we worship together
this Easter morning...

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:25.676
...and more, as we pray to him
who died and rose again...

01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:29.357
...that we might have life
and have it more abundantly...

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.356
...let us remember especially those who
have gone from this country and town...

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.870
...to live and die in far-off places
for a like purpose.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:45.189
May they know his mercy,
his comfort and his peace.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:50.555
May we uphold them with our prayers,
encourage them with our letters...

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:55.316
...honor them with our love.
And may our lives, not less than theirs...

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:57.710
...be dedicated to that same Lord...

01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:01.236
...who alone can give to life
a perfect freedom...

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.755
...and a final peace.

01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.712
Let us pray.

01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:09.313
Our Father, who art in heaven...

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:13.155
...hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come...

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:17.154
...thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:20.433
Gives us this day,
our daily bread...

01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:24.718
...and forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors...

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:29.317
...and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:33.678
...for thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory...

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.308
...forever. Amen.

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:45.238
Thank you. Come again.

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.755
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Cross.

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.239
Selena.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.437
Miss Cross, you have a father
in the Navy. Lucas Augustus Cross?

01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:58.953
My stepfather.

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:00.832
Have you seen him lately?

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.152
Not for a year and a half.

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.719
What's wrong?

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:08.874
He went on leave and didn't come back.
He's listed as a deserter.

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.600
Miss Cross, you're sure
you haven't seen him?

01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:14.554
I didn't even know
that he was in the Navy.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.878
- He hasn't called or written you?
- No.

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:23.194
He disappeared from town a year
and a half ago, deserting his family.

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.316
Looks like he's running true to form.

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:29.798
If you do hear from him, get in touch
with the First District Shore Patrol.

01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:31.632
I will.

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:44.479
Selena, don't get upset.
It's not your fault they can't find him.

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.631
What is it? What's wrong, Selena?

01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:56.751
Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone.
I can't keep it to myself any longer!

01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:59.912
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:02.469
Lucas didn't desert.

02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.873
How do you know?

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:09.875
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!

02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:16.115
- I don't believe it.
- I did. I buried him in the sheep pen!

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:25.670
Selena, you've gotta call
the state police.

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:29.115
No. No, I can't!

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:31.993
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.831
Please don't make me!

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.548
Listen to me, Selena. Listen.

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:41.190
- One of us has got to call.
- I can't!

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.670
- No.
- You must call them now.

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.196
I can't.

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.394
- Pardon me.
- Allison!

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:26.273
Norman.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.877
- What a surprise.
- Yeah.

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.750
Come here. Hey, you guys.
You know... .

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.038
- You look older. More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.

02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.838
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.434
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.

02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:44.238
I remember you liked to write.

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.470
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?

02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:49.518
No, I got a job working
for a book publisher.

02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:52.877
He didn't publish those books
with the plain wrappers, did he?

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.029
- Remember?
- No.

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.077
- Yes, you do. Remember?
- Yes.

02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:59.710
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:05.754
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really. You look great.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.319
Thanks.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.871
You know, you never said goodbye
to me when you left Peyton Place.

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.912
You never even said goodbye.

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.469
I'll never forget
that Labor Day, Norman.

02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:18.517
I won't either.

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:21.838
- I see you have two Purple Hearts.
- Yeah.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.672
What brings you home? Vacation?

02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:26.798
- Haven't you heard about Selena Cross?
- No, why?

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.829
She killed her stepfather, Lucas.
Her trial starts in two days, for murder.

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:36.639
Lucas was always a bad joe, but she
seemed to be able to put up with him.

02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:39.473
Who ever knows what
anyone's able to put up with?

02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:41.439
Well, that's true.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.593
Sure took me a long time to know about
myself and understand Peyton Place.

02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.954
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:53.555
I'm gonna go back and try
and work things out with my mother.

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:56.953
Maybe we'll both be happier.

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:02.312
If not, well, at least
I've made the effort, you know?

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.393
I always wondered why you enlisted.
In the paratroopers, I mean.

02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:14.198
I guess I wanted to get knocked off
or something.

02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:16.590
But as soon as I got away
from my mother...

02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:21.834
...I realized how wonderful life really was.
Then I fought like a tiger to stay alive.

02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:27.957
I was running away from my problems.
You know what I mean.

02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:29.838
Yeah, I know.

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:33.028
Something's bothering you, isn't it?

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:35.873
Yeah.

02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:38.638
Can I help?

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:41.076
No, you can't.

02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:43.196
- Okay.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:45.312
All right.

02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.071
Hey, have you had dinner?
Would you like dinner, with me?

02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:51.468
- Okay.
- Okay?

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.312
All right.

02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:43.950
- Doc Swain.
- Hi. Evening, Selena. Be right with you.

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:49.788
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.

02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:54.472
Watch your feet.

02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.635
Are you gonna tell them about me?

02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:02.917
- I'll have to, Selena.
- Nobody in town must ever know.

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.351
- But if I don't, you'll be risking your life.
- I know that.

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:08.391
- Well, then why?
- Because of Ted.

02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:11.552
What are you afraid of, what he'll think?
He loves you.

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:14.957
It would ruin his life,
married to a girl who... .

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:18.033
Not a respectable person in town
would accept him.

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:22.478
"Respectable. " What kind of
respectability are you talking about?

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:25.393
The people with enough money
to hire him as a lawyer.

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.950
Look, don't you understand?
We're talking about your whole life.

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:31.998
Prison can be a kind of dying.

02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.197
Losing Ted would be
a worse kind of dying.

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:40.428
- Besides, you mustn't get involved.
- Never mind about me.

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:44.912
Promise me you won't tell them.
Promise me, please promise!

02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:50.434
All right, Selena. I'll promise you.

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:54.635
You don't seem to realize you face
a possible life sentence.

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:58.475
- I need more to work with, much more.
- There is no more.

02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:02.189
Lucas was drunk and brutal.
When he tried to beat me, I killed him.

02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:07.354
Killing in self-defense is understandable.
But you hid the body, like a criminal.

02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:09.875
- I know.
- She was fighting for her life.

02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:13.635
The state is sending a prosecutor
for one purpose: to convict Selena.

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:18.191
I've seen him work. He's thoroughly
competent and relentless as law itself.

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:21.996
Tell her to come in. There must be
something you haven't told me.

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:25.835
- He tried to kill me, I killed him first.
- But you hid the body! Why?

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.479
Come in, Allison.

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:30.077
Allison.

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.549
I was never happier to see
anyone in my life.

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:34.278
Are you all right?

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:37.313
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Allison.

02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:40.717
I can testify about Lucas.
I saw him beat her.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.279
It'll help, believe me.

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:45.750
- We appreciate you coming back.
- You'll get her off, won't you?

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:47.911
We're gonna do the best we can.

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.868
But the jury decides
on the one thing: evidence.

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:53.837
Now, it adds up to this:

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.788
We have a murder, and a defense
that's too simple to be good.

02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:00.599
It's open to attack from many sides.

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:04.357
Selena, have you told me
the whole story?

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:06.238
I'm sorry.

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.196
There's no more to tell.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:16.273
Hello, Allison.

02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:21.599
- You look well.
- With a drink in my hand?

02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:24.156
Would you care for something?

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:37.318
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.958
You haven't learned, have you?

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.156
Yes, I have, Mother.

02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:47.597
I've learned to smoke and drink
and go to bed when I want to.

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:51.116
And kiss boys whenever
the impulse sweeps over me.

02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.435
Allison, we all make mistakes,
but if we face them, truthfully...

02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:58.272
...they can be overcome.

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.319
Can we overcome the fact of my birth,
that I'm illegitimate?

02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:05.313
I think so. With love.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:08.153
Thank you, and goodbye, Mother.

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.838
As soon as this trial is over, I'm taking
the first train out of this town.

02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:16.670
Goodbye, Mother.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.675
Court will come to order.
Everybody rise.

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.075
Be seated, please.

02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:19.430
The recess in the trial of
The State v. Selena Cross is over.

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.875
Gentlemen, you may proceed.

02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:25.919
Prosecution wishes to recall
Joseph Cross to the stand.

02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:40.075
- Joey...
- I told you my name was Joseph.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:42.953
Joseph.

02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:48.194
This morning, before recess, we were
talking about lying and telling the truth.

02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:51.480
Joseph, have you ever told a lie?

02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.790
- Yes, sir.
- Big ones, or little ones?

02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:56.838
Some little ones,
and some medium ones.

02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.960
Would you lie to save your sister
from prison?

02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:01.951
- Yes, sir.
- A big lie?

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.156
The biggest lie you ever heard.

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.834
- I object!
- Sustained.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.232
Joseph, we heard your testimony
this morning. Was it true?

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.753
It was all true.

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:18.074
Do you claim your sister killed your
stepfather because he grabbed her?

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.754
He was a strong man,
and we were both afraid.

02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:23.798
If Lucas was as strong as you
and everybody else said...

02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:26.474
...how could your sister
possibly overpower him?

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:29.518
She was madder than he was,
and scareder.

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:33.355
Lucas was 195 pounds...

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.273
...your sister, 110.

02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:39.159
Did she sneak up behind him
and hit him...

02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.629
...with that firewood
when he wasn't looking?

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.472
No, sir.

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:47.993
- Were you watching every second?
- I might've looked away once or twice.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.233
Did you see Selena hit him
the first blow?

02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.796
- I don't know.
- Is there any doubt...

02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:56.030
...as to how that first blow
was struck?

02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:59.593
I don't know. It all happened so fast.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:01.514
Joseph...

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.515
...you said that you told your sister
to bury your stepfather.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.831
- That's right. She didn't want to.
- I see.

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:14.716
How old were you when you told her,
when she did what you wanted?

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:17.359
About 8.

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:19.317
In other words...

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.598
...a 19-year-old girl didn't know
what to do with the body...

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:27.230
...until an 8-year-old boy told her.

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:28.998
Yes, sir.

02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:31.470
I have no further questions.

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:36.155
- No questions.
- You may step down, Joseph.

02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.310
I wish to recall Selena Cross
to the stand.

02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:00.678
Miss Cross, yesterday
you told the jury...

02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:03.559
...that your stepfather
disappeared from home...

02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:06.757
...a year and a half
before you killed him.

02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:10.513
Do you have any idea why he left?

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:16.675
I'm not sure. I'd only be guessing.

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.838
You hesitated. Why?

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.438
I don't know.

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:26.038
Do you know what he did
during that year and a half?

02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:28.236
He was in the Navy, he said.

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:30.789
Do you imply that he came home
from the war...

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:33.520
...from combat duty,
just to beat you up?

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.269
We object, Your Honor. The defendant
has implied no such thing.

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:38.429
Sustained.

02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:44.273
Did your stepfather
own the house you live in?

02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:48.956
- Well, my brother and l, we fixed it up.
- Answer the question, please.

02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:52.396
- It wasn't a house when he left...
- Please answer the question.

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:55.597
Yes, but it was a dirty shack
and nothing else!

02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:01.153
But you had the freedom to come
and go and invite boys in...

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:05.115
...and answer to no one
while Lucas was gone, didn't you?

02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:06.629
Didn't you?

02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:09.030
Yes, I had the freedom, but I never did!

02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:12.351
When you thought he was gonna
change that, did you kill him?

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.149
No! Lucas was drunk
and tried to beat me!

02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:20.196
The coroner testified
that he was unconscious...

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.558
...from the first blow, so you were safe
from any beating, but you didn't stop.

02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.551
- Why?
- I don't know.

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:30.349
You kept on hitting him until
you crushed the life out of him. Why?

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:34.559
I don't know. I couldn't stop!
I couldn't stop!

02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:41.231
When you finally did kill him,
why didn't you call the police?

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:44.517
I wanted to. I was afraid.

02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:49.310
But you hadn't committed any crime,
defending yourself.

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:51.869
What was there to fear
from the police?

02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:54.474
I don't know. I was just afraid.

02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:59.874
You had nothing to fear until you
hid Lucas' body, isn't that right?

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:03.191
Then you had a great deal
to fear, didn't you?

02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.237
- That's right.
- But you buried him.

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:08.278
You must have had a reason.
A powerful reason.

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:10.749
Don't tell me it was
because you were afraid.

02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.035
- I was!
- Are you sure?

02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:14.794
- That's the only reason!
- Fear is panic...

02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:17.599
...and cleverly burying a man
you just murdered...

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:19.671
...requires cold thought.
- Objection!

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:22.513
- You knew what you were doing.
- I didn't! I didn't!

02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:26.958
- Prosecution is harassing the witness.
- Objection sustained.

02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:29.391
I withdraw the question.

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.391
I have nothing further.

02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:34.353
Miss Cross, at all times
during the quarrel...

02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.795
...which led to the death
of Lucas Cross...

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:39.952
...were you in fear of bodily harm?

02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:41.917
Yes, I was.

02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:44.833
I have no further questions.
You may step down.

02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:49.675
I wish to call Miss Allison MacKenzie
to the stand.

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:06.312
Raise your hand. Do you swear to tell
the truth, whole truth, so help you God?

02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:08.038
- Yes.
- Be seated.

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:11.152
- State your name, please.
- Allison MacKenzie.

02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:15.199
Miss MacKenzie, how long have
you known Selena Cross?

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:16.998
Ever since I was a child.

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:21.472
We went all through school together.
Miss Cross is my best friend.

02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:26.676
You have testified that when you saw
Lucas beating Selena...

02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:29.718
...you thought your presence
prevented it from going on.

02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:33.236
- I know it did.
- No, you don't know, you assume.

02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:36.034
He was embarrassed
to find me watching.

02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:38.874
How many times did Lucas hit Selena?

02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.075
- Once.
- Once?

02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:44.391
Did he hit her with his fist
or a weapon?

02:16:44.559 --> 02:16:45.879
It was kind of a slap.

02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:47.838
Oh, a slap.

02:16:48.559 --> 02:16:50.790
Have you ever been slapped,
Miss MacKenzie?

02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:54.396
- Yes.
- By a stranger?

02:16:54.559 --> 02:16:56.754
- No.
- By a member of the family?

02:16:56.959 --> 02:17:00.509
- Do I have to answer these questions?
- I'm sorry, but you do.

02:17:01.639 --> 02:17:04.234
By my mother.

02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:07.915
As hard a blow as Selena Cross'
stepfather gave her?

02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:09.478
- No.
- How could you tell?

02:17:09.639 --> 02:17:11.870
- I don't think so.
- You don't really know...

02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.600
...what happened in that house.
- Yes, I do know.

02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:16.876
First you talk about a beating...

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:20.635
...and then we find out all you're
discussing is a single blow.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.117
Would you say the arguments
in the Cross household...

02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:26.999
...were more or less violent
than any other family's?

02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:29.799
- Objection.
- What's the purpose of that question?

02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:35.268
The witness must define her terms,
if the jury is to clearly understand her.

02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:37.317
A beating becomes one blow.

02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.558
A blow becomes a slap. Perhaps the slap
will become something else.

02:17:41.879 --> 02:17:43.870
Objection overruled.

02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:48.558
No further questions.

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:50.839
No questions, Your Honor.

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:53.236
You may step down.

02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:00.432
The prosecution calls
Mrs. Constance MacKenzie to the stand.

02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:18.313
Raise your hand. Do you swear to tell
the truth, whole truth, so help you God?

02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:19.833
- I do.
- Be seated.

02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:22.031
State your name, please.

02:18:22.559 --> 02:18:23.913
Constance MacKenzie.

02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:31.155
Mrs. MacKenzie, I understand you've
known the defendant a long time.

02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:33.709
Yes, since she was a baby.

02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:38.910
Did Selena ever complain that her
stepfather had beaten her at any time?

02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:41.713
What?

02:18:41.879 --> 02:18:44.553
- Did Selena ever complain...?
- No.

02:18:44.719 --> 02:18:47.678
Did you ever see any marks on her?
Injuries?

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:49.159
No.

02:18:49.639 --> 02:18:52.552
You knew the defendant's mother well,
did you not?

02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:55.115
Nellie worked for me as a housemaid.

02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:01.309
Did she ever mention Lucas' brutality,
or describe any beating he administered?

02:19:01.879 --> 02:19:07.830
No, she said he was drunk and lazy,
and he deserted her...

02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:12.834
...and she committed suicide over the
kind of life that Lucas brought them to.

02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:15.475
We're not concerned
with Mrs. Cross' suicide.

02:19:15.639 --> 02:19:16.754
I don't see why not.

02:19:16.959 --> 02:19:20.316
There was something terribly wrong
in the Cross family life.

02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:24.553
Something wrong when a woman had to
raise her daughter up almost alone...

02:19:24.719 --> 02:19:26.995
...and trying to help her...

02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:35.472
- Mrs. MacKenzie.
...and not being able to help...

02:19:35.959 --> 02:19:37.915
...and not being able to give.

02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:40.038
Mrs. MacKenzie.

02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:45.035
I'm aware of your concern over the
suicide, but that is not the point at issue.

02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:48.755
Did your daughter ever tell you
she'd seen Lucas beat Selena?

02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:50.239
No.

02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.278
Don't you think if she had seen
such an incident...

02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:56.000
...she would have mentioned it to you?

02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.754
- I don't know.
- Well, wouldn't she?

02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:00.918
Well... .

02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:05.518
Mrs. MacKenzie, doesn't your daughter
ever bring home her problems?

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:09.072
How many times do I have to answer
your questions?

02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:11.515
Until we find out the truth.

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:16.192
The truth is...

02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:19.792
...my daughter did bring
her troubles home...

02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:23.431
...and I wouldn't understand.

02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:28.549
- Well, if she brings her problems home...
- I wouldn't understand!

02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:35.032
The court will adjourn
for a short recess.

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:43.958
Come in.

02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:49.919
What have I done to Selena?

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:51.479
You had no choice.

02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.631
But I did have a choice.

02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:57.998
Maybe the wrong one,
but I'll never forgive myself if... .

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:03.393
You blame yourself too much, Connie.
You did what you morally had to do.

02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:09.154
Here.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:25.318
- Charlie, can I speak with you?
- Sure.

02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:40.996
Court will come to order.
Remain seated, please.

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:52.876
Has the prosecution completed
its questioning of Mrs. MacKenzie?

02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:55.315
It has. The prosecution rests.

02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:57.909
No more questions.
You may step down.

02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:03.954
We call Dr. Matthew Swain to the
stand, as a witness for the defense.

02:22:12.640 --> 02:22:15.837
Do you swear to tell the truth,
whole truth, so help you God?

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:17.479
- I do.
- Be seated.

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:20.035
- State your name.
- Dr. Matthew Swain.

02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:23.317
Do you know of any act of force
or violence...

02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:25.710
...Lucas perpetrated
against the defendant?

02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:27.757
I certainly do.

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:33.788
We've wasted time torturing a girl who's
emotionally unable to speak for herself.

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:38.119
Lucas Cross was a drunkard
and a wife beater and a child abuser.

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:39.879
I object.

02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:42.759
"Child abuser" is an exaggerated,
inflammatory word.

02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:45.480
I mean "child abuser"
in the worst way possible!

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.915
I object. The deceased is not on trial.

02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:52.278
Lucas Cross' character, as to force
and violence, is on trial here.

02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:54.989
You may continue, Dr. Swain.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.719
The night that Lucas Cross
left town...

02:22:58.880 --> 02:23:02.634
...I performed what I recorded
as an appendectomy on Selena Cross.

02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:04.358
It was not an appendectomy.

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:09.111
I falsified my records.
I assisted her in a miscarriage.

02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:12.034
A miscarriage of Lucas Cross' baby.

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:16.632
I said it was Lucas Cross' baby
that Selena carried.

02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:21.430
- I object to this statement as evidence.
- On what grounds?

02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:23.795
It's the conclusion of the witness.

02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:26.838
- Except that it's true.
- Can you testify to this?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.319
I can.

02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:30.994
Objection overruled. Continue.

02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:36.792
I have here a complete admission
of guilt, signed by Lucas Cross.

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:42.397
Will the attorneys please
approach the bench?

02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:50.270
I offer Lucas Cross' confession
into evidence, Your Honor.

02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:51.873
I object, Your Honor.

02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:56.517
The confession of a person not a party
to the case is totally inadmissible.

02:23:56.840 --> 02:24:01.595
The prosecution may have a sound point,
but I'll reserve my ruling until...

02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:06.754
...I've heard his testimony. If I find it
inadmissible, I'll order it stricken.

02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:09.872
His entire testimony stricken
from the record?

02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:12.838
I will rule on that when I've heard it.

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.397
You will complete your statement,
Dr. Swain.

02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:24.549
I'm sure that the prosecutor will see that
the state investigates my records...

02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.190
...and perhaps I could lose the privilege
to practice medicine...

02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:30.794
...but it's time that someone
spoke up...

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.719
...and paid the price
for the privilege of speaking.

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:36.633
Selena killed Lucas out of fear.

02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:41.231
Fear of being forced to submit to him
again, and then she hid her crime...

02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.752
...for fear of how we'd react to her
being assaulted by her stepfather.

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:50.272
She couldn't trust us with the truth.
Selena had no one to go to but me.

02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:53.597
She only came to me because she had
to for medical reasons.

02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:55.352
She swore me to secrecy.

02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:58.791
Now I'm violating that secrecy
for a bigger purpose.

02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:03.753
We're all prisoners of each other's
gossip, killed by each other's whispers...

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:05.512
...and it's time it stopped.

02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.673
Our best young people leave as soon
as they can earn a bus ticket.

02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:12.952
They contribute their characters
to other communities...

02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.350
...because they're stifled
in Peyton Place.

02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:17.238
We're not interested...

02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:21.951
Dr. Swain has come forth at considerable
risk to himself and I intend to hear him...

02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:23.712
...without any interruption.

02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:26.917
I will rule on your objection
when he's finished.

02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:29.277
You will continue, Dr. Swain.

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:34.878
We're a small but prosperous town,
yet we allow tarpaper shacks to stand.

02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:38.357
We have half a dozen churches
which most of you attend...

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:43.031
...and then don't practice the word they
preach once you walk down the steps.

02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:46.437
We have a fine school
that you take for granted.

02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:49.797
We have a newspaper with a most
intelligent editorial page...

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:52.554
...which you use
for wrapping garbage.

02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:55.348
It's time you people woke up.

02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:58.677
Perhaps today you will,
because there's something bigger...

02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:01.434
...than the tragedy of Selena Cross
on trial here.

02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:05.599
Our indifference, our failure as a
community to watch over one another...

02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:08.638
...to know who needs help
and to give it.

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:11.997
Selena's been living in a prison
of her own long enough...

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:13.639
...one that we helped build.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.911
I have nothing more to say.

02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:24.756
The objection of the prosecution
is not sustained.

02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:28.192
The jury may consider this statement
as evidence.

02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:43.716
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:45.878
We have, Your Honor.

02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:48.349
The foreman will read the verdict.

02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:51.956
We find the defendant not guilty.

02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:02.151
Court is adjourned.

02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:41.397
Come on, Joey,
you come home with me.

02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:48.792
Selena, would you like to go now?

02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:33.990
Good going, doc!

02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:38.188
Selena, we're so very happy for you.

02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:23.599
Mother... .

02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.191
Come on, Norman.

02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:08.350
We'd finally discovered
that season of love.

02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:11.752
It is only found
in someone else's heart.

02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:17.275
Right now, someone you know
is looking everywhere for it...

02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:19.590
...and it's in you.

02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:29.591
