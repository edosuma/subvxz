13:51.205 --> 13:52.706
<i>- We collected water...</i>
- Doc.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.167
<i>- ...plant, animal samples...
-</i> I need you to come with me.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.920
- I was so sure.
<i>- ...which you will see in the literature.</i>

13:59.088 --> 14:00.214
I'm sorry?

14:01.841 --> 14:02.967
The cure.

14:03.717 --> 14:04.802
It failed.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.137
Yeah. We're under attack and we got to go.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.723
[spluttering] No. This is more important!

14:09.723 --> 14:13.477
I just need to find
the... the missing link, the right piece,

14:13.477 --> 14:14.770
the right DNA.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.981
Your wife is more important.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.693
I'm gonna get you and Rani somewhere safe.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.152
- Okay?
- Yes, of course.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.821
- Rani. Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.698
Of course. What about my research?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.533
Someone will come back for that.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.703
[grunting groggily]

[door creaks open]

14:48.679 --> 14:50.556
[muttering indistinctly]

14:52.474 --> 14:53.684
Where the hell are they?

14:54.476 --> 14:56.854
I don't know. They escaped.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.025
But I'm gonna find them.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.985
And I swear when I do,

15:04.278 --> 15:06.697
I'm gonna make their lives a living hell.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.533
[ominous music builds]

15:09.533 --> 15:10.701
Wait a minute.

15:11.827 --> 15:12.995
It's you.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.538
- [music swells]
- You're goddamn right.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.497
[loud clang]

15:15.497 --> 15:17.166
That's it, Jepp. You're free!

15:17.166 --> 15:18.167
[Jepp chuckles]

15:19.585 --> 15:21.503
Ah. I missed you, man.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.214
- I missed you more.
- Yeah.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.383
Hey, I got something for you.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.262
It's seen better days,

15:30.262 --> 15:33.390
but I didn't want you
to leave that behind.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.060
Thanks, Jepp.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.146
Now, you ready to get out of here?

15:39.730 --> 15:43.025
Yep, once we find my friends.
We escaped the Kennels together.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.319
They're heading to the south gate.
We'll meet them there.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.155
They'll be fine.
Their mom's coming for 'em.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.032
Then we'll all escape together.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.493
Gus, we haven't got time for this.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.911
We need to go.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.371
It's you and me now.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.831
I am not leaving without them, Big Man.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.875
[quietly resolute music playing]

16:00.709 --> 16:01.919
And neither are you.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.256
All right, Sweet Tooth.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.301
Let's go find your friends.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.888
[Last Man] Let's go. Move it. Move!

16:14.932 --> 16:15.933
[indistinct chatter]

16:15.933 --> 16:17.184
[Hulk exhales heavily]

16:21.563 --> 16:24.566
- [Last Man 1] Is that a door?
- [Last Man 2] No one went through here.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.367
Wendy, we have to find another way out.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.661
There is no other way out.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.996
What are we gonna do?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.205
I don't know.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.630
[delicate, curious music playing]

[distant explosions, indistinct chatter]

[plucky, adventurous music playing]

17:13.490 --> 17:14.366
What is she doing?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.755
[Maya grunting, huffing]

17:44.480 --> 17:46.690
[gasps] I can pull everybody up!

17:50.944 --> 17:52.613
[adventurous music swells, trails off]

17:52.613 --> 17:54.656
[suspenseful music builds]

17:54.656 --> 17:55.741
Hold tight.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.372
What about Gus?

18:04.958 --> 18:07.336
- I'll find him. You look after the others.
- Okay.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.712
We'll meet you there.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.923
Guys, come on.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.175
You ready? You ready?

18:13.175 --> 18:14.218
All right.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.470
What's going on?

18:16.470 --> 18:18.472
[Johnny] Grab everything you need.
You're leaving.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.765
What are you talking about?

18:21.892 --> 18:23.310
You wanted to escape, right?

18:24.770 --> 18:25.896
Now's your chance.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.023
Johnny.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.235
I'm really glad I got to meet you.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.114
Meant a lot to me.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.950
[delicate, poignant music playing]

18:39.785 --> 18:41.495
Helping you get out is the least I can do.

18:41.495 --> 18:45.249
There's an actual war going on.
Where on Earth are we supposed to go?

18:45.749 --> 18:47.376
Anywhere is better than here.

18:47.876 --> 18:48.877
Come with us.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.631
Come on,
this is your chance to escape too.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.677
My brother needs me.

19:07.229 --> 19:11.358
Adi, this is the day we've waited for.
We're getting out of this horrible place.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.610
What about my research? The cure?

19:13.610 --> 19:14.695
Adi...

19:14.695 --> 19:17.030
We don't have any serum, no treatment.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.533
Adi, I don't care about that anymore.
Any of it.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.119
Just you.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.540
Rani, if we leave now, we have less
than a month together, but if we stay,

19:26.540 --> 19:29.501
I can still find a way to keep you alive.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.878
Adi, this isn't living.

19:32.045 --> 19:38.010
We've been running from fate
for nine long years, and I am tired.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.513
I just want us to be together and free.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.394
Gargoyle.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.730
Gargoyle.

Eyes on the sky. Move.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.632
Let's do this.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.593
[indistinct chatter]

20:36.902 --> 20:38.028
Miss Eden.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.115
I'll admit I underestimated you.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.200
General.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.160
We're ready.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.745
[Last Man 2] Target acquired.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.457
Hold.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.167
[plane buzzing]

20:53.252 --> 20:54.253
Hold.

[explosion booms]

21:09.017 --> 21:10.560

21:10.560 --> 21:12.980
Let the rout begin.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.398
[falling barrel whistling]

21:14.398 --> 21:16.483
[tense, distressing music playing]

21:21.363 --> 21:22.739
[Tiger and Becky grunt]

21:25.659 --> 21:27.494
- Now we're even.
- I didn't need help.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.704
Not what it looked like.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.414
[frustrated grunt]

21:37.504 --> 21:39.089
Why are you following me?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.008
We're both going
to the same zoo, remember?

21:42.342 --> 21:45.178
You think I want anything
to do with you after the shit you pulled?

21:45.178 --> 21:46.763
The shit I pulled?

21:46.763 --> 21:48.724
I didn't join the Last Men.

21:50.851 --> 21:51.727
No.

21:52.853 --> 21:57.024
You were too busy stabbing me in the back
in front of everyone that mattered to me.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.152
[uneasy music playing]

22:06.783 --> 22:07.743
You're right.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.874
I'm sorry.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.960
[uneasy music swells]

22:30.265 --> 22:32.726
Why do you care about him so much, anyway?

22:35.062 --> 22:35.896
Gus.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.524
Because I help hybrids.

22:40.150 --> 22:40.984
No.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.861
This is different.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.949
His mom's alive, Tiger.

22:48.992 --> 22:49.868
I talked to her.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.996
She asked me to get this to him.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.707
Yeah, that still doesn't
answer my question.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.042
Don't you get it?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.169
Gus was looking for his mom.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.546
They deserve to be together.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.465
If I can help to make that happen,

23:03.465 --> 23:06.009
maybe for once I'll have done
some good in this world.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.303
That is such self-righteous bullshit.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.514
Say that again.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.646
[softly] Okay.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.609
I see what's going on now.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.444
What are you talking about?

23:24.444 --> 23:25.779
This isn't about Gus.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.490
This is about your sister.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.245
You think if you can help
reunite Gus with his mom,

23:33.245 --> 23:35.997
then maybe you finally have
a chance of finding Wendy.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.132
Okay, then.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.299
Let's go.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.384
I already told you-

23:47.384 --> 23:49.719
Just shut up
and let me do the right thing, okay?

23:49.719 --> 23:50.679
[explosion booms]

23:53.890 --> 23:55.475
Just me and you, huh?

23:56.518 --> 23:57.644
Not just you and me.

Pony,

24:01.940 --> 24:02.941
Rhino,

24:03.942 --> 24:04.985
and all the others.

- You mean...
- That's right.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.365

26:23.748 --> 26:24.833
[Hulk] Stop right there!

26:28.336 --> 26:30.755
Let's make this nice and easy.

26:30.755 --> 26:31.715
[slingshot thwips]

26:33.425 --> 26:36.011

Or should I say,

the hybrid catcher?

26:45.312 --> 26:48.356
Nobody gets to call me that ever again.

Get the kids.

Come here.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.396
- I'm here.
- I love you.

27:31.983 --> 27:35.195
- Where are the others? Are they safe?
- Heading to the south gate.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.822
Well, we'll find them. Okay?

27:38.448 --> 27:39.699
Look what they did.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.661
This was our home.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.829
This is just bricks and concrete.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.832
Home is wherever we're all together.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.460
Let's go. Come on.
